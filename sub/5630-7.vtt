00:01.102 --> 00:01.234
.

00:01.869 --> 00:02.235
- Deputy Crowley.

00:03.304 --> 00:04.738
- Chicago PD,
put your hands up!

00:04.738 --> 00:06.006
- Been reviewing your team
over the past six months.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.341
You certainly have
an aggressive unit.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.742
- Thank you.

00:08.742 --> 00:10.744
- There's a young girl,
and she's my daughter.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.813
- If you have any hope
of keeping us together,

00:12.813 --> 00:14.382
you better get
a paternity test.

00:14.382 --> 00:17.485
- The results are in.

00:17.485 --> 00:19.487
- The other night
was a one-time deal.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.754
- Everybody knows.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.757
So why are we still
trying to hide it?

00:23.757 --> 00:25.393
- We should get out of here.
- Mm-hmm.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.966
- And, you know, really don't
know what he thinks of me.

00:32.966 --> 00:35.203
I mean...I got bumped up
a year ago.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.171
I still don't know
where I'm at.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.307
I mean, you know Voight
little better than me.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.842
You think he thinks
I'm good police?

00:41.842 --> 00:42.910
- I think Voight thinks

00:42.910 --> 00:44.578
everyone's got room
for improvement.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.679
You know what I'm saying?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.315
- Yeah, I feel you.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.919
Is that James Whitaker?

00:51.919 --> 00:54.255
- Oh, he's the captain
of the 31st, right?

00:54.255 --> 00:55.823
- Like the Black Pope
of Chicago.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.225
Does a big card game.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.527
All the powerful brothers
in the city are there.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.429
If you're in that game,
you made it.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.830
- Hmm.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.199
You know, the way you've
got to handle Voight is you--

01:05.199 --> 01:07.401
- Oh, hold on.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.139
- Good talk.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.476
- Captain Whitaker?

01:15.476 --> 01:18.011
Kevin Atwater
out of Intelligence.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.748
Just wanted to come over here
and introduce myself.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.616
- Atwater.

01:22.616 --> 01:23.817
- Yes, sir.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.753
See, um, I'm a little new.

01:25.753 --> 01:28.055
You know, still kinda
settling in my bones.

01:28.055 --> 01:31.159
But, you know, 20 years ago,
you were where I am,

01:31.159 --> 01:33.794
and 20 years
down the road, you know,

01:33.794 --> 01:35.963
I'm hoping that
I can be where you are.

01:35.963 --> 01:38.599
And, you know,
being a brother...

01:38.599 --> 01:40.534
- Officer Atwater,

01:40.534 --> 01:43.304
you just made two mistakes.

01:43.304 --> 01:48.409
First, our shared skin color
is irrelevant to me.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.878
Good police is good police.

01:50.878 --> 01:54.615
And secondly, I get one
half hour of peace each day,

01:54.615 --> 01:57.951
by myself,
which is my breakfast,

01:57.951 --> 02:00.688
and you have
disturbed that.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.625
- Yeah, so I should
probably just--

02:04.625 --> 02:07.094
- Yes.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.571 --> 02:19.673
- Actually, no,
I didn't realize he was missing

02:19.673 --> 02:21.775
until this morning.
That's not like Colin.

02:21.775 --> 02:22.876
He's very responsible.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.645
- How old is your son?
- 15.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.614
- You called his school?
- I called everybody.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.716
I called his cell phone
a million times.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.218
- Has he ever
run away before?

02:30.218 --> 02:32.119
- Never.
- Okay.

02:32.119 --> 02:34.222
We can get the ball rolling
on a missing person's report,

02:34.222 --> 02:35.489
but I'll need
a recent photo.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.359
- I found this under his bed.
- His diary?

02:38.359 --> 02:40.127
- You need to look at it.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.962
He's not just missing.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.766
- "I want to kill."

02:45.766 --> 02:48.236
- I swear to you,
I had no idea.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.870
Colin has been
pretty agitated.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.240
I thought it was just
normal teenage stuff.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.409
- "Today I will have
my revenge at WCD."

02:55.409 --> 02:57.311
WCD?

02:57.311 --> 03:00.314
- Webster Country Day,
his school.

03:00.314 --> 03:04.051
- Does your son
have access to a gun?

03:04.051 --> 03:07.621
[indistinct PA announcement]

03:07.621 --> 03:09.357
- Right this way.

03:09.357 --> 03:12.393
[PA announcement continues]

03:18.699 --> 03:20.000
- Colin Blake.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.902
Went missing yesterday
with a loaded pistol

03:21.902 --> 03:23.070
taken from his house.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.272
- We checked
with the headmaster.

03:24.272 --> 03:25.639
Colin was marked absent,

03:25.639 --> 03:27.375
but his Mom recognized his bike
outside the school,

03:27.375 --> 03:29.076
so we think he's here.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.144
- Well, get very uniform
a picture of this kid

03:31.144 --> 03:32.680
and start sweeping
the campus.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.014
- Got it.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.148
Hey.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.651
- Atta boy.
- Sarge.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.821
Just got word.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.123
Patrol found a body
behind the school.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.825
- By the fence.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.527
[indistinct chatter]

03:46.527 --> 03:48.296
- What do we got?

03:48.296 --> 03:49.963
- It's him.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.966
[dark music]

03:52.966 --> 04:01.074
*

04:04.878 --> 04:07.915
- Well, body's cool.
He's been here a while.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.383
- He's still
holding onto the gun,

04:09.383 --> 04:11.785
and there's a muzzle flash
by the entry wound.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.554
It looks like a suicide.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.122
- It's a .22 caliber.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.990
No wonder
nobody heard the shot.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.858
- All right, Burgess,
I want you

04:18.858 --> 04:21.228
to hand deliver
that pistol to forensics.

04:21.228 --> 04:24.131
Tell them I need a rush order
to confirm ballistics.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.066
- Got it.
- And keep sweeping the school.

04:26.066 --> 04:30.338
We don't know if this kid
was operating alone.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.205
- Guys, nobody move!

04:32.205 --> 04:34.408
Don't key your radios.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.410
Just back up slow.

04:49.390 --> 04:49.523
.

05:06.774 --> 05:07.375
- It's a very crude pipe bomb.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.478
- Thanks, Sully.

05:10.478 --> 05:13.180
- Crude bomb in the right place
will do a lot of damage.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.950
- Just doesn't make any sense.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.620
I don't know
what happened to him.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.390
He was always such
a happy kid.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.828
- I can't imagine
how difficult this is,

05:27.828 --> 05:31.164
but I have to ask
these questions.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.066
Colin went missing yesterday,

05:33.066 --> 05:35.235
but you didn't report it
until this morning.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.269
Is that right?

05:36.269 --> 05:38.972
- Oh, I--I got home late.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.241
I fell asleep.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.411
Just assumed he was here.

05:43.411 --> 05:46.580
- How was he able
to get his hands on a gun?

05:46.580 --> 05:49.883
- My ex left it
for my protection.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.552
- Did your son
have any activities

05:51.552 --> 05:53.120
outside of the swim team?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.855
- Um...video games.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.425
Lots--lots of video games.

05:57.425 --> 06:00.861
- So he was
basically unsupervised?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.996
- It's hard
when you work two jobs.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.699
It's not like
I can afford a nanny.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.969
- That wasn't an accusation,
Ms. Blake.

06:08.969 --> 06:13.006
- Who was Colin's friend, EJ?

06:13.006 --> 06:14.708
- I'm not really sure.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.910
He, uh...
he was an only child.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.646
He was used to being alone.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.948
- So he didn't have
one close companion?

06:20.948 --> 06:24.017
- I wish I could tell you.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.086
I...

06:26.086 --> 06:29.256
I never knew that he was
in so much pain.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.727
- Yo, O, I heard you know
James Whitaker.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.597
- Yeah, we both worked in
the Wild Bunch back in the day.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.331
Good police,
great poker player.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.367
Just...

06:40.367 --> 06:44.204
don't interrupt
his breakfast.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.639
- Alvin, you got a second?

06:45.639 --> 06:47.708
- Yeah.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.480
- Over here.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.482
Over here.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.653
It's about Michelle.
There's kind of a problem.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.188
- What do you mean?

07:01.188 --> 07:03.657
- I got a courtesy call from
my friend, Beatrice Mulaney.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.726
She's the director
of juvenile hall.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.860
- Huh.
- It turns out

07:06.860 --> 07:08.829
Michelle's release was
only contingent.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.297
- On what?

07:10.297 --> 07:12.065
- She's still a minor.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.668
So unless one of her parents
officially claims guardianship,

07:14.668 --> 07:17.104
she has to be put
back into the system.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.372
Beatrice sent over
the paperwork just in case.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.509
I figured you'd want to
talk it over with Meredith

07:21.509 --> 07:23.210
before you sign it.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.984
Or not.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.653
- Colin Blake.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.655
Apparent suicide
outside of his school.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.989
We're waiting
on the ballistics,

07:35.989 --> 07:37.224
but the gun that was
recovered at the scene

07:37.224 --> 07:38.526
is registered
to Colin's father.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.127
- I questioned the headmaster.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.662
He said Colin was a loner.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.031
Scholarship student,
swim team.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.767
He was the kind of kid who you
saw around but never noticed.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.168
- I checked Colin's phone.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.538
There's a few texts and phone
calls, but nothing jumps out.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.073
You know, he didn't post much
on social media.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.008
No manifestos.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.910
- Except that
in Colin's journal,

07:56.910 --> 08:00.548
he always draws his revenge
fantasies with a partner.

08:00.548 --> 08:03.050
He talks a lot
about a kid named EJ.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.853
"Talked to EJ at practice.
He's the only one who gets it.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.555
"I have to do
this no matter what.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.456
I hope EJ is with me."

08:09.456 --> 08:11.859
- So maybe
EJ wasn't with Colin.

08:11.859 --> 08:14.061
Something happened.
He didn't show up.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.395
Colin got cold feet

08:15.395 --> 08:17.097
and decided he couldn't
go through with it alone,

08:17.097 --> 08:19.099
and he took himself out
instead of his classmates.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.569
- If EJ is in fact
a real person

08:21.569 --> 08:23.136
and they were
in this together,

08:23.136 --> 08:24.705
he could still be planning

08:24.705 --> 08:26.106
to carry out the attack
on the school.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.575
- Well, there's
no EJ at Webster,

08:27.575 --> 08:29.409
but there are four boys
with those initials,

08:29.409 --> 08:32.078
and one of 'em
is on the swim team.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.746
Ethan Jones.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.215
- Find him.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.717
Get expedited
search warrants,

08:36.717 --> 08:38.051
talk to teachers, students,

08:38.051 --> 08:40.287
anybody who knew Colin.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.022
I need to know
if there's an ongoing threat

08:42.022 --> 08:43.924
at Webster Country Day.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.659
- You're sure
Ethan's at school?

08:45.659 --> 08:46.927
- Yeah.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.295
They're doing
grief councils.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.964
EJ wanted to go.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.333
- Did Ethan and Colin
spend a lot of time together?

08:53.333 --> 08:54.902
- They were on
the swim team.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.204
Colin came over here sometimes
to play video games.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.307
- Was he in trouble
at school?

09:00.307 --> 09:02.309
- Is my son in danger?

09:02.309 --> 09:05.078
- Antonio, you got
to have a look at this.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.181
I did a search history check
on Ethan's computer.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.784
That's from four days ago.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.653
"How to build
a homemade bomb."

09:18.992 --> 09:20.227
[door opens]

09:20.227 --> 09:22.630
- It's a difficult day.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.098
Colin was a good teammate,

09:25.098 --> 09:28.435
but there was a lot
going on we couldn't see.

09:28.435 --> 09:31.338
The grief counselors are here
to help you process everything.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.742
- Coach Sanders,
can we have a word?

09:37.678 --> 09:39.046
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.649
- Which of these boys
is Ethan Jones?

09:41.649 --> 09:42.983
- He's not here.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.752
- His mother said
he was with you.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.387
- I dismissed Ethan
from the team last month.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.857
Is it true that Colin was
planning to bomb the school?

09:49.857 --> 09:52.660
- We're collecting
information.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.194
- Cops all over the campus.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.796
The students are freaked out.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.965
We're supposed
to be grieving,

09:57.965 --> 10:01.101
but if you think about
what could have happened,

10:01.101 --> 10:02.770
maybe we should be
celebrating.

10:02.770 --> 10:06.473
[screaming]

10:06.473 --> 10:08.876
[overlapping shouting]

10:08.876 --> 10:10.543
- Hey!

10:12.646 --> 10:13.681
- Get off me!
- Out of the way!

10:13.681 --> 10:15.048
Out of the way!

10:15.048 --> 10:16.549
You, stand back!

10:16.549 --> 10:17.918
- Move away!
Get back!

10:17.918 --> 10:19.252
- Get out!
Get out of the way!

10:19.252 --> 10:20.721
- Move away!
You, move back!

10:20.721 --> 10:22.122
- [groans]
- You, move back!

10:22.122 --> 10:23.123
- [coughs]

10:23.123 --> 10:24.124
- Are you okay?

10:28.729 --> 10:28.862
.

10:31.732 --> 10:31.932
- Loner,

10:33.667 --> 10:36.670
bunch of fights at school,

10:36.670 --> 10:38.906
arguments with teachers,

10:38.906 --> 10:42.676
violent video games
on his computer.

10:42.676 --> 10:45.679
- Guys, this is Detective McCabe
from the youth division.

10:45.679 --> 10:48.181
Since Ethan's a minor,
he has to be in there with us.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.683
- As an observer.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.952
- He's a minor who hasn't
been charged with a crime.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.087
Let's play nice.

10:54.087 --> 10:57.290
- You and me.
- Sarge, let me do this.

10:59.927 --> 11:03.496
I used to be this kid.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.834
- Get it.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.175
- Hey, Ethan.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.844
I'm Detective
Erin Lindsay.

11:16.844 --> 11:18.411
- I'm Detective Jay Halstead.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.646
- And I'm Detective McCabe.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.114
I'm with the youth division.

11:21.114 --> 11:24.351
I'm here on your behalf.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.286
- Why am I here?

11:26.286 --> 11:28.155
I'm the one who got beat up.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.925
- Ethan, I think the kids
at school were just scared.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.661
Not just about Colin.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.129
They're scared about you.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.899
- [scoffs]

11:38.899 --> 11:42.269
- Did you know that Colin
kept a notebook?

11:43.937 --> 11:46.206
It's pretty interesting.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.541
"Talked to EJ
at practice today.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.311
He's the only one
who gets it."

11:51.311 --> 11:53.580
EJ is you, right?

11:58.786 --> 12:02.189
"I want revenge.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.624
I want to kill."

12:10.430 --> 12:11.464
- [laughs softly]

12:11.464 --> 12:15.502
- Is there something
funny to you in there?

12:15.502 --> 12:16.804
- If you knew
what it was like,

12:16.804 --> 12:19.206
you wouldn't be too happy
about it either.

12:22.209 --> 12:26.146
- You're at a school
with a lot of rich kids,

12:26.146 --> 12:31.318
and you didn't fit in,
like Colin.

12:31.318 --> 12:34.454
The rich kids,
they look down on you,

12:34.454 --> 12:36.723
bully you.

12:36.723 --> 12:39.526
You and Colin, you decide
to take your revenge.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.829
- You really don't get it.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.596
I wasn't planning
to kill bullies.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.833
- Then what were
you planning?

12:45.833 --> 12:47.935
[tense music]

12:47.935 --> 12:49.937
What am I not seeing?

12:49.937 --> 12:55.242
*

12:55.242 --> 12:57.510
- Nothing.

13:02.315 --> 13:05.886
- Hey, Ethan,

13:05.886 --> 13:08.455
I'm here.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.757
All right?
Tell me.

13:10.757 --> 13:18.765
*

13:18.765 --> 13:20.868
- Um...

13:23.436 --> 13:24.504
[knock on door]

13:24.504 --> 13:26.739
[door opens]
- EJ.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.275
Oh, baby, look at you.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.542
- I'm all right.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.445
- All right, Ethan,
stay with me.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.547
Hey, stay with me.

13:34.547 --> 13:39.286
What were you
and Colin planning?

13:39.286 --> 13:42.890
- You don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

13:42.890 --> 13:46.759
All that stuff about Colin,
that was his thing.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.063
- You're just gonna
let this kid walk?

13:50.063 --> 13:52.565
- I can't arrest him
for something he might do.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.101
I can't even hold him.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.468
He's a minor.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.636
- Since when did Hank Voight

13:56.636 --> 13:58.071
become such a stickler
for the rules?

13:58.071 --> 14:01.008
- Oh, so now you're
taking the leash off?

14:01.008 --> 14:03.143
Is this coming from you
or the superintendent?

14:03.143 --> 14:05.178
So I can tell people
if it goes sideways.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.513
- If this kid is a monster
and we set him--

14:06.513 --> 14:10.450
- Deputy, can I please just
get back to doing my job?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.519
Please.

14:13.921 --> 14:15.722
- Just tell me
you have a handle on this.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.757
- I don't, actually.

14:17.757 --> 14:18.926
Yet.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.730
- Deputy.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.265
- What's up?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.499
- Ran all
the criminal complaints,

14:26.499 --> 14:27.667
and I got a hit on Ethan.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.136
He was a suspect
in a vandalism report.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.938
Somebody put a rag
in the gas tank of a motorcycle

14:30.938 --> 14:32.305
and blew it up.

14:32.305 --> 14:34.274
The owner tried to accuse Ethan,
but he couldn't prove it.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.508
- Kirby Peterson.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.211
- Yeah, senior class president
of Webster Country Day.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.546
- Hmm.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.581
And what are we hoping
to learn from Mr. Peterson?

14:41.581 --> 14:42.983
- I feel like we got
a beef on our hands

14:42.983 --> 14:44.717
and we need to see
how big it is.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.753
- Good.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.363
- Kirby Peterson?

14:56.363 --> 14:59.032
- Yeah.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.433
I knew it was Ethan

15:00.433 --> 15:02.669
because he told me he was
going to get back at me,

15:02.669 --> 15:04.471
and he laughed
about it afterwards.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.706
- What provoked him?
- Who knows?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.141
Ethan's a freak.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.510
We're talking about
a totally deranged loser.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.446
I mean, weren't they going
to blow up our school?

15:13.446 --> 15:16.716
- I'll ask it again.
What provoked him?

15:16.716 --> 15:19.452
- [sighs]

15:19.452 --> 15:21.354
We were on
the swim team together.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.090
Ethan was one
of the newbies.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.157
- Colin too.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.892
- Yeah.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.427
So we have this tradition.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.895
After one of the practices,

15:28.895 --> 15:30.363
while the freshmen
are in the showers,

15:30.363 --> 15:32.765
varsity comes in and takes
their towels and their clothes,

15:32.765 --> 15:35.002
so when they come out,
you know...

15:35.002 --> 15:36.903
- Fun times.
- It's initiation.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.271
Happens to everybody.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.007
But Ethan went nuts.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.408
He came after me
with a fire extinguisher.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.343
I swear,
he was trying to kill me.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.577
- By extinguishing you?

15:44.577 --> 15:47.314
- He had it over his head
ready to crush my skull.

15:47.314 --> 15:49.016
- And after he threatened you,
you and your buddies

15:49.016 --> 15:53.020
didn't take the ballgame
back to him to save face?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.221
- No.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.591
- Kirby,
if you know something

15:58.591 --> 16:00.227
about what Ethan
might be up to next--

16:00.227 --> 16:01.694
- I would tell you.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.164
And at this point,
I'm gonna need my dad here

16:04.164 --> 16:07.267
if we're gonna
talk about this any more.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.045
- You threw away
the paternity test

16:18.045 --> 16:21.048
without even seeing
the results?

16:21.048 --> 16:24.217
- If I don't step up,
it'll go bad for Michelle.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.053
- What about Lexi?

16:26.053 --> 16:29.056
How's it gonna go for her?

16:29.056 --> 16:32.592
- I can be a father
to them both.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.427
We'll make it work.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.896
- We?

16:36.896 --> 16:38.198
The daughter of a woman

16:38.198 --> 16:40.300
that you had
an affair with

16:40.300 --> 16:42.069
comes to live with us.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.436
We can make that work?

16:43.436 --> 16:44.437
- Meredith.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.772
- Okay, look, Al--

16:45.772 --> 16:47.074
- Meredith, Meredith, Meredith--

16:47.074 --> 16:49.342
- Al, this is what we do.
- Baby, baby, baby--

16:49.342 --> 16:50.543
- No, It's simple.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.580
We just find this girl
a foster home.

16:53.580 --> 16:57.550
- Hey, I can't just
toss her to the wolves.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.155
Michelle needs a father.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.260
She deserves that.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.900
- I hear you, Al.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.336
I really do.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.439
- Hey, stay--stay with me.

17:19.439 --> 17:23.109
- I'm gonna put your stuff
out on the lawn.

17:23.109 --> 17:26.346
If it's not gone by tomorrow,
I'm gonna burn it.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.349
[somber music]

17:29.349 --> 17:37.390
*

17:38.391 --> 17:39.926
- Hey.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.361
- Hey, what's up?

17:41.361 --> 17:44.397
- We got two paper jobs
in the queue.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.866
- I know. I'll see you
in the parking lot.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.168
- Okay.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.669
- Hey, bro.
- Hey, what's up?

17:49.669 --> 17:52.372
- How you doing, man?

17:52.372 --> 17:54.541
Come here,
I got a genius idea.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.743
- Yeah.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.382
What?

18:02.382 --> 18:04.484
- Come over for
dinner tonight.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.586
- I can't.
I have to see my sister.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.288
Her cat's touch and go.
- Oh, again?

18:08.288 --> 18:10.290
Come on, that cat,
he's faking it for sympathy.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.658
I'm telling you.
Come on over.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.993
I'm gonna cook for you.
- Since when do you cook?

18:13.993 --> 18:16.329
- You ever had
fettuccine Alfredo?

18:16.329 --> 18:17.664
- Not since high school.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.965
- I've got a secret recipe.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.200
- Okay.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.469
- Extra cream.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.871
- [laughs]
Mm.

18:24.871 --> 18:25.905
- See, I like that smile.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.240
- Yummy.
- I'm just trying to...

18:27.240 --> 18:28.241
You coming over?

18:28.241 --> 18:30.076
- Oh, the cat.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.478
I'll call you.
- The cat?

18:31.478 --> 18:34.381
Don't call.
Just come over.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.822
- Jay, yo, I got a ping
on Ethan's phone.

18:42.822 --> 18:45.392
It was moving,
but now it has stopped.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.195
It's at 313 Bristol Street.
I'll run the owner.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.830
Darren Sanders.
- Ethan's swim coach.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.332
Get Burgess and Roman
to check it out.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.833
- Okay.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.869
[sirens wailing]

18:59.339 --> 19:02.409
[suspenseful music]

19:02.409 --> 19:08.014
*

19:08.014 --> 19:09.216
- What's going on?

19:09.216 --> 19:10.283
- We're looking
for Ethan Jones.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.351
Is he here?

19:11.351 --> 19:12.952
- No.
Why would he be?

19:12.952 --> 19:14.053
- I'll get the back.

19:14.053 --> 19:16.223
- Mind if I take
a look inside?

19:16.223 --> 19:18.958
- Of course not.
Come on in.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.728
- Roman!

19:21.728 --> 19:25.232
I got something.

19:25.232 --> 19:33.273
*

19:38.645 --> 19:41.581
- This your car?

19:49.289 --> 19:49.422
.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.525
- Pedophile.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.664
Pretty nasty allegation.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.135
- You can write anything
on a car.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.437
It doesn't make it true.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.574
- You know...

20:07.574 --> 20:08.908
we thought Ethan was
planning on

20:08.908 --> 20:11.944
going after
the bullies at his school.

20:11.944 --> 20:15.582
Turns out his coach
was the bully.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.616
Or worse.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.017
- The only thing
I'm guilty of

20:18.017 --> 20:19.752
is looking after
a troubled kid.

20:19.752 --> 20:22.389
- Took him under your wing.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.190
Spent extra time with him.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.558
- I did.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.294
I made sure he got rides.

20:27.294 --> 20:28.461
His mom worked late.

20:28.461 --> 20:31.197
Sometimes he'd come
for dinner after practice.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.999
My wife...
[laughs]

20:32.999 --> 20:35.835
well, she's...
a more-the-merrier type.

20:35.835 --> 20:37.837
- Let me ask you something.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.540
[tense music]

20:40.540 --> 20:43.543
You do the same favors
for Colin Blake?

20:43.543 --> 20:45.412
*

20:45.412 --> 20:48.681
- As a coach,
you do what you can.

20:48.681 --> 20:52.118
But Colin...

20:52.118 --> 20:56.022
he was definitely
under Ethan's influence.

20:56.022 --> 20:59.626
He may have turned him
against me.

20:59.626 --> 21:04.364
*

21:04.364 --> 21:07.967
- You did something to him.

21:07.967 --> 21:12.339
- Yeah, I set boundaries.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.574
Because Ethan...

21:14.574 --> 21:15.575
he started showing up

21:15.575 --> 21:17.910
out of the blue
looking for favors.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.946
He wanted too much.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.951
It's hard.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.355
He lost his father
in Afghanistan.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.957
But finally I told Ethan,

21:30.957 --> 21:34.761
"I can't be your father."

21:34.761 --> 21:36.829
He didn't like that.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.865
- Hmm.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.768
- Snail brought
this for you.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.169
It's from Captain Whitaker.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.437
You in trouble?

21:44.437 --> 21:47.374
- No. Why?
You heard something?

21:47.374 --> 21:49.709
- I'd rather get a call
from my gynecologist

21:49.709 --> 21:52.845
than a formal letter
from Captain Whitaker.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.117
- Why are you
making me come here?

21:58.117 --> 22:00.252
- I could arrest you
for vandalism.

22:00.252 --> 22:03.623
We're just gonna have
a conversation.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.091
- Ethan.

22:05.091 --> 22:08.094
[dark music]

22:08.094 --> 22:09.462

22:09.462 --> 22:10.930
I don't know what game
you're playing here,

22:10.930 --> 22:12.899
but please,

22:12.899 --> 22:16.403
you need to stop this now.

22:16.403 --> 22:17.937
- You need to leave.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.739
- I cut him from the team.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.442
Now he's trying
to get back at me.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.877
*

22:24.877 --> 22:25.978
- Go.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.414
- Yeah, come on.

22:27.414 --> 22:29.048
You heard the guy.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.216
- Let's go.

22:30.216 --> 22:34.687
*

22:34.687 --> 22:39.526
- Ethan, you got
to help me understand.

22:39.526 --> 22:43.062
Why'd you spray-paint
"pedophile" on his car?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.198
[sighs]

22:46.198 --> 22:49.836
Maybe it's too hard
to say out loud.

22:49.836 --> 22:53.473
So you spray-painted it

22:53.473 --> 22:55.708
knowing you'd get caught.

23:00.447 --> 23:04.617
Knowing that this whole thing
would just blow up.

23:07.820 --> 23:11.190
And that...

23:11.190 --> 23:15.294
is fine.

23:15.294 --> 23:18.364
That's fine.

23:18.364 --> 23:19.599
Sometimes things like this,

23:19.599 --> 23:23.202
you just got to take
a sledgehammer to 'em first.

23:23.202 --> 23:30.477
*

23:30.477 --> 23:32.879
But now here we are.

23:32.879 --> 23:37.383
*

23:37.383 --> 23:39.519
Tell me what's been going on.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.853
I swear to you,

23:40.853 --> 23:44.857
I'm gonna do everything
I can to make it right.

23:44.857 --> 23:52.899

23:54.501 --> 23:57.136
- [whimpers]

23:57.136 --> 23:59.338
- It's okay.

24:01.307 --> 24:04.944
- [crying]

24:04.944 --> 24:09.682
My dad told me...

24:09.682 --> 24:12.852
I was supposed
to be a man.

24:12.852 --> 24:15.622
*

24:15.622 --> 24:18.357
- We just kicked
a pedophile.

24:20.527 --> 24:22.929
- We don't let Sanders
out of our sight.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.164
- Got it.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.768
[Ethan crying]

24:28.768 --> 24:36.809
*

24:43.115 --> 24:46.152
- Ethan, what else
can you tell me?

24:52.124 --> 24:55.161
- He recruited me
in public school.

24:59.566 --> 25:03.335
He promised he'd get me
a scholarship to Webster.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.574
That's when it started.

25:12.144 --> 25:18.217
And then when Colin told me the
same thing happened to him...

25:18.217 --> 25:22.589
we wanted to hurt Coach.

25:22.589 --> 25:26.225
[sniffles]
To get back at him.

25:26.225 --> 25:29.762
But I didn't want anybody
to know what he did to me.

25:38.337 --> 25:40.840
[exhales]

25:40.840 --> 25:42.609
[sniffles]

25:46.813 --> 25:48.848
There was another boy.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.983
- Another boy

25:50.983 --> 25:53.219
that Sanders abused?

25:53.219 --> 25:54.921
- His name was Jeff.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.289
He contacted Colin.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.958
He said he went
to a school in Milwaukee

25:58.958 --> 26:02.494
where Coach used to teach...

26:02.494 --> 26:05.097
and said the same things
happened to him.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.433
- What did Colin say
Jeff wanted to do, go public?

26:07.433 --> 26:10.036
- No.

26:10.036 --> 26:13.139
Revenge.

26:13.139 --> 26:16.208
We were gonna meet up
with Jeff that day,

26:16.208 --> 26:20.379
me and Colin,

26:20.379 --> 26:22.749
to blow up Coach's car.

26:22.749 --> 26:27.654
But I backed out.
I couldn't go through with it.

26:27.654 --> 26:31.958
Maybe that's why Colin
killed himself.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.263
- How do I find Jeff?

26:39.531 --> 26:41.801
- I don't know.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.836
- Where did you guys
say you were gonna meet?

27:02.722 --> 27:02.855
.

27:03.990 --> 27:04.691
- All right,
Sanders did coach

27:05.792 --> 27:07.093
at a small
prep school in Milwaukee,

27:07.093 --> 27:09.061
but he never had a Jeff
on any of his teams.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.830
There was one Jeffrey
at the school,

27:10.830 --> 27:12.699
but he's black
and he lives in London.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.400
- I spoke
to Milwaukee police.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.268
Never any charges filed
against Sanders,

27:16.268 --> 27:17.536
no victim reports.

27:17.536 --> 27:20.339
- M.E. came back
on Colin's death.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.308
Muzzle burn is
consistent with suicide,

27:22.308 --> 27:24.443
but there wasn't enough
gun powder residue on his hand,

27:24.443 --> 27:26.145
and the angle of entry
doesn't make sense.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.613
- Colin was murdered.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.015
- It's looking like it.

27:29.015 --> 27:31.550
Time of death between
10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.119
- We know where
Sanders was then?

27:33.119 --> 27:34.486
- He was at the school

27:34.486 --> 27:36.723
with an airtight alibi
for when Colin disappeared.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.190
- Uh, guys?

27:38.190 --> 27:40.059
Guys, I just pulled
the surveillance footage

27:40.059 --> 27:42.028
from the cameras
around the Emerald City Cafe

27:42.028 --> 27:43.996
on the afternoon
that Colin died.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.032
There's one next door.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.903
There we go,
so there's Colin.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.504
And that's Jeff.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.341
I know it's not much, but,
you know, he's 5'10", white,

27:55.341 --> 27:56.809
he's got a tattoo on the neck.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.911
They left around 1:15.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.512
- So this Jeff
lured Colin out

28:00.512 --> 28:03.115
pretending to be another
victim and then killed him.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.384
- Sanders has to be the one
pulling the strings.

28:05.384 --> 28:08.520
- I accessed Coach Sanders's
bank records.

28:08.520 --> 28:13.760
He liquidated a college fund
a week ago for $3,200.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.862
- Where's he gonna
hire a hit man for that?

28:15.862 --> 28:18.330
- He volunteered at a juvenile
detention center last year

28:18.330 --> 28:20.366
as a conditioning coach.

28:20.366 --> 28:23.235
You throw a rock in there,
you're gonna hit somebody

28:23.235 --> 28:26.405
willing to pull a trigger
for that price.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.875
- Find this guy.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.145
- Ethan, um...I got to go,

28:33.145 --> 28:34.781
but your mom's on her way in.

28:34.781 --> 28:36.382
Okay?

28:36.382 --> 28:37.817
- Can I ask you something?

28:37.817 --> 28:39.585
- Sure.

28:45.191 --> 28:49.361
- Does my mom need to know?

28:49.361 --> 28:51.831
- Yeah, man.
She does.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.904
- Can you be
the one who tells her?

29:02.241 --> 29:05.411
- If that's
what you really want.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.956
- Do me a favor
and don't leave me alone

29:16.956 --> 29:18.390

'cause--

29:18.390 --> 29:19.826

29:28.200 --> 29:30.402

Sanders's conditioning classes.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.671

in the last six months?

29:32.671 --> 29:34.173
[keys clacking]

29:34.173 --> 29:35.842

You want their names?

29:35.842 --> 29:39.711
- No, looking for
a white male.

29:39.711 --> 29:41.347
- Got 22 of those.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.849
- Well, he's got tattoos.

29:42.849 --> 29:44.116
- That doesn't narrow it down.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.451
- One on his neck.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.253
- Let's see.

29:47.253 --> 29:50.656
Three of those.

29:50.656 --> 29:51.858
- That's him.

29:51.858 --> 29:55.127
- Jessie Mandel,
released three weeks ago.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.528
- Okay, I need an address.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.597
- 524 Green Street.
It's a halfway house.

Got a Jessie Mandel
living here?

30:08.740 --> 30:09.909
- I did.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.577
He blew out of here
20 minutes ago.

30:11.577 --> 30:12.578
- What was he wearing?

30:12.578 --> 30:14.947
- He had a green backpack.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.916
- Any idea
where he was going?

30:16.916 --> 30:18.417
- He's not coming back.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.386
Said he came into some money.

30:20.386 --> 30:21.453
- Did he have a car?

30:21.453 --> 30:22.788
- Not that I know of.

It's called a halfway house
for a reason.

You only know half the stuff
that's going on.

30:26.893 --> 30:29.628

on his way out of town.

33:11.157 --> 33:13.159
*

33:13.159 --> 33:14.360
- What is this?

33:14.360 --> 33:16.362
- Darren Sanders,
you're under arrest.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.197
- For what?

33:18.197 --> 33:20.066
- Crimes against children.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.801
- Look, I'm not going anywhere
until I talk to my lawyer.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.270
- Yeah?
Turn around.

33:24.270 --> 33:28.407
Put your hands there.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.676
You know I'll drag you
out of here

33:30.676 --> 33:33.312
face first across the ground
in front of all your guests.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.247
Give me a reason.

33:35.247 --> 33:37.649
Please.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.485
No?

33:39.485 --> 33:40.519
Move.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.854
- Call my lawyer.
Now.

33:42.854 --> 33:48.394
*

33:50.329 --> 33:51.830
- Okay.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.266
Sanders's lawyer is on his way.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.535
- Well, hold him off.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.936
Just let me set the hook.

33:57.936 --> 33:59.671
- Sarge.
- Hmm?

33:59.671 --> 34:02.108
- I want to do this.

34:05.844 --> 34:08.214
- Maybe a little too much.

34:10.248 --> 34:13.119
- Hey, come on.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.655
[door opens]

34:21.460 --> 34:24.295
- I'm confused.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.768
See, I got--

34:29.768 --> 34:32.138
I got Jessie Mandel
in the other room,

34:32.138 --> 34:35.474
and he's spinning a version
that, I don't know,

34:35.474 --> 34:37.976
doesn't add up.

34:37.976 --> 34:40.879
I mean, Jessie's saying
you paid him to kill Colin.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.880
- I don't know who Jessie Mandel
is, and I don't have anything--

34:42.880 --> 34:44.783
- Darren, Darren, Darren.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.918
We're way past that, okay?

34:47.918 --> 34:50.222
We know.

34:54.360 --> 34:57.996
We know you met Jessie when
you were volunteering at juvie.

34:57.996 --> 35:03.001
We know you drained your kid's
college fund to pay him.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.171
We know, okay?

35:07.005 --> 35:11.177
I'm here--I mean,
I'm trying to help you,

35:11.177 --> 35:14.713
and you're insulting
my intelligence.

35:16.582 --> 35:20.419
I just want to know the truth.

35:20.419 --> 35:23.189
I mean, did you pay Jessie
to scare the piss out of Colin

35:23.189 --> 35:26.192
so he'd keep his mouth shut?

35:26.192 --> 35:28.360
I mean, that's--

35:28.360 --> 35:29.728
that's the only thing
makes sense to me

35:29.728 --> 35:31.062
based on the amount
of money that--

35:31.062 --> 35:32.564
- I want to talk to my lawyer.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.200
- Oh, yeah?

35:36.702 --> 35:39.070
You want to talk
to your lawyer?

35:40.939 --> 35:44.042
That's your right.

35:44.042 --> 35:47.479
Let me tell you something.

35:47.479 --> 35:51.016
If I walk out of this room

35:51.016 --> 35:56.355
and I go back over to Jessie...

35:56.355 --> 35:59.391
his version
gets carved in stone,

35:59.391 --> 36:03.695
and you take the ride.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.030
All of it.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.832
You understand?

36:06.832 --> 36:08.667
[dark music]

36:08.667 --> 36:10.001
[laughs softly]

36:10.001 --> 36:16.675
*

36:16.675 --> 36:18.677
- It's fine.

36:18.677 --> 36:26.718
*

36:28.454 --> 36:32.458
Jessie wasn't supposed
to kill Colin!

36:32.458 --> 36:36.462
He was just supposed
to scare him!

36:36.462 --> 36:44.503
*

36:52.344 --> 36:54.446
Jessie wasn't supposed
to kill Colin.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.448
He was just supposed
to scare him to keep him quiet.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.417
That is all
I told Jessie to do.

36:58.417 --> 37:01.019
- Uh-huh.

37:02.921 --> 37:06.024
- So Colin's death,

37:06.024 --> 37:09.561
that is on Jessie.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.397
Right?

37:11.397 --> 37:19.438
*

37:22.874 --> 37:23.942
- Hey.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.777
- Hey.

37:28.414 --> 37:31.317
Hey, listen, I don't like
cases like this one,

37:31.317 --> 37:33.819
but I'm grateful
when you guys do catch 'em.

37:33.819 --> 37:34.820
That's for sure.

37:34.820 --> 37:38.524
- Hm,
Yeah, I guess, huh?

37:38.524 --> 37:41.059
Hey, Sean, I'm--

37:41.059 --> 37:43.895
I'm really sorry to hear
about your friend.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.831
You know, we all heard
about what you were doing

37:45.831 --> 37:49.635
for that boy, and
I'm just sorry he passed, man.

37:49.635 --> 37:52.137
- Thanks.

37:52.137 --> 37:53.372
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.741
- Listen.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.978
When Nadia died,
I wasn't exactly in a hurry

37:59.978 --> 38:02.348
to talk to anybody about it.

38:02.348 --> 38:05.351
That didn't go so well for me.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.653
You're gonna go through
whatever you got to go through,

38:07.653 --> 38:11.523
but...I'm around, man.

38:11.523 --> 38:15.394
Everybody's here for you.

38:15.394 --> 38:18.196
- I just haven't gotten my head
around it yet, you know?

38:18.196 --> 38:20.466
Still pretty angry.

38:20.466 --> 38:23.101
- Yeah.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.371
- I appreciate
you reaching out.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.980
- Good evening.
- Hey.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.214
- Through there.
- Right there?

38:36.214 --> 38:37.416
- Yeah.
[indistinct chatter]

38:37.416 --> 38:39.918
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.252
[funk music playing]

38:41.252 --> 38:42.454
[door closes]

38:42.454 --> 38:44.222
- Gentlemen?

38:44.222 --> 38:47.092
Uh...I got an invite.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.761
*

38:49.761 --> 38:52.263
- This is Kevin Atwater
from the 21st.

38:52.263 --> 38:54.666
Alvin Olinsky said
he's all right.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.502
Thought we could use
some new blood.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.169
- What we could use
is some new money.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.506
- Uh...how much new money?

39:00.506 --> 39:03.108
- How much you got?

39:03.108 --> 39:05.411
- That's your spot.

39:05.411 --> 39:07.245
- Oh.

39:07.245 --> 39:09.915
*

39:09.915 --> 39:11.583
[sighs]

39:11.583 --> 39:17.923
*

39:17.923 --> 39:20.125
- How you feeling, Chief?

39:21.727 --> 39:23.862
Oh.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.964
Thank you.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.870
Thanks.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.776
[pop rock playing]

39:37.776 --> 39:38.910
*

39:38.910 --> 39:39.978
- [chuckles]

39:39.978 --> 39:42.548
Yeah!

39:42.548 --> 39:44.583
[humming]

39:44.583 --> 39:46.585
[knock at door]

39:46.585 --> 39:53.692
*

39:53.692 --> 39:55.527
Hello, beautiful lady.

39:55.527 --> 39:57.262
- Adam.
- Oh, hey, Al.

39:57.262 --> 40:00.031
- I need a place to crash
just for a few days.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.667
- Oh.
Uh...

40:01.667 --> 40:03.769
- Hey, thanks, man.
- Yeah.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.971
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:05.971 --> 40:11.176
*

40:11.176 --> 40:15.113
- So...where do I sleep?

40:15.113 --> 40:17.716
- Uh, well...

40:17.716 --> 40:20.218
- How about Michelle
takes the bedroom?

40:20.218 --> 40:23.188
You and me can rough it
on the couches.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.190
- Yeah,
there's only one couch.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.927
- We'll figure it out.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.962
- Is this fettuccine Alfredo?

40:30.962 --> 40:32.731
- Yeah.

40:32.731 --> 40:35.300
- I love fettuccine Alfredo.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.569
- Oh.
- Yeah.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.538
- Oh.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.039
- Hey, baby.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.074
[laughs softly]

40:45.410 --> 40:47.045
- Hi.

40:49.314 --> 40:50.682
- You look just like him.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.917
- [laughs softly]

40:51.917 --> 40:55.587
That's what my mom
says sometimes.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.255
- I was a soldier too.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.725
- Yeah?

40:59.725 --> 41:01.793
- Yeah, man.

41:05.697 --> 41:08.734
I've known some heroes.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.604
But what you did,

41:12.604 --> 41:14.239
going public,

41:14.239 --> 41:18.209
telling the truth
about what happened,

41:18.209 --> 41:21.747
that might just be the bravest
thing I've ever seen.

41:24.750 --> 41:27.753
[stirring music]

41:27.753 --> 41:29.220
*

41:29.220 --> 41:32.057
- I miss him.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.560
- I know.

41:34.560 --> 41:38.597
- Did you lose friends?

41:38.597 --> 41:42.267
- Many, yeah.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.736
- How do you deal with it?

41:44.736 --> 41:46.938
*

41:46.938 --> 41:48.139
- When I get down,

41:48.139 --> 41:51.242
I...I try to remind myself

41:51.242 --> 41:53.579
that they made a sacrifice

41:53.579 --> 41:57.583
so that I could come home
and live my life.

42:00.218 --> 42:03.889
I just try to honor that.

42:03.889 --> 42:06.758
Your dad would be so happy
for you right now.

42:06.758 --> 42:08.426
- Yeah?

42:08.426 --> 42:10.696
- Yeah.

42:10.696 --> 42:13.865
Not just because of
what you did,

42:13.865 --> 42:17.202
because it's over.

42:17.202 --> 42:19.204
- [laughs softly]
