WEBVTT

00:03.264 --> 00:04.439
Hey, babe.

00:05.614 --> 00:07.529
What's wrong?

00:07.572 --> 00:09.705
Well, wh-what is it? A ghost.

00:09.748 --> 00:12.403
I told you,
I felt a presence here.

00:12.447 --> 00:15.189
[whispers]:
No. My little sister's here.

00:15.232 --> 00:17.713
You're kidding me.
No, you're not.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.541
Hey, Kelly.

00:19.584 --> 00:23.414
Why did you... when
did you come here?

00:23.458 --> 00:25.112
Oh, I have a conference in town.

00:25.155 --> 00:27.723
They booked me at the The Ritz,
but I stay at nice places

00:27.766 --> 00:29.377
all the time,
so I thought I'd come

00:29.420 --> 00:31.292
to your little cabin instead.

00:31.335 --> 00:34.077
It's not a cabin, okay?

00:34.121 --> 00:35.992
I'll have you know, this is
the sixth-biggest house

00:36.036 --> 00:37.559
on the block.

00:37.602 --> 00:41.215
Well, you look great.
Country life suits you.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.565
Pittsburgh is a city.
How can you not...

00:43.608 --> 00:45.436
Okay, you know what, Adam,

00:45.480 --> 00:48.396
wh-why don't you help me get
Kelly's bag out of the car?

00:48.439 --> 00:51.616
We have sports teams.
Mister Rogers is from here.

00:51.660 --> 00:54.619
Oh, oh, uh, Kelly,
meet our friend Lowell.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.795
Lowell, this is my sister Kelly.

00:56.839 --> 00:58.580
Enjoy.

00:58.623 --> 01:01.713
So, how do you know
Adam and Andi?

01:01.757 --> 01:02.845
I work for them.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.890
Oh, well, you'll bounce back.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.069
When is she leaving?

01:09.112 --> 01:10.548
Her bag's still in the car.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.463
I could drive her
to the airport right now.

01:12.507 --> 01:15.162
She's my sister.
I can't ask her to leave.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.380
Oh, well, she's not my sister.
I'll ask her.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.468
I'll do that right now.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.340
Adam.

01:19.383 --> 01:22.038
It's not good for you
when she's here.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.474
All she does is judge you.

01:23.518 --> 01:25.433
Just don't let her bother you.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.043
Yeah, but I know
she bothers you.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.697
Why do you let her get away

01:28.740 --> 01:31.656
with acting superior
all the time, huh?

01:31.700 --> 01:35.486
"Cabin." We have heated floors
in our bathroom.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.054
We do?They're broken, but yeah.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.144
Look... [sighs]
It'd be great

01:41.188 --> 01:43.277
if my sister didn't always
compare her glamorous,

01:43.320 --> 01:45.148
jet-setting life
to me settling down

01:45.192 --> 01:47.672
in an average town
with an average joe.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.633
Average joe?

01:51.676 --> 01:55.506
I am the sixth-best
husband on the block.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.117
You're amazing,

01:57.160 --> 02:00.163
which is why I am not gonna play
her game, all right?

02:00.207 --> 02:01.947
It's called
taking the high road.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.688
Yeah, but she already
looks down on us.

02:03.732 --> 02:07.301
Let's at least get
our money's worth. Low road.

02:07.344 --> 02:10.869
Adam, I have a wonderful husband
and three loving children.

02:10.913 --> 02:14.482
No matter what she says,
I am happy with my choices.

02:14.525 --> 02:18.442
So even though
I am not competing, I win.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.489
Well, since you already won,
let's celebrate

02:21.532 --> 02:23.839
by taking her to the airport.[groans]

02:23.882 --> 02:25.275
[door closes]

02:25.319 --> 02:28.017
Don't leave me alone
with her anymore.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.498
Do you guys think I look
like Forrest Gump?

02:31.716 --> 02:33.762
No.Only when you run.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.548
How are you two sisters?

02:37.592 --> 02:39.028
You don't even look alike.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.812
[laughs]
Ugh...

02:40.856 --> 02:42.988
Well, she spent
a little time

02:43.032 --> 02:44.816
in Switzerland,
if you know what I mean.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.211
Yeah. When she blinks, you can
see the back of her neck move.

02:48.255 --> 02:51.997
Oh, I got so much good stuff.
Let me at her, coach.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.869
No, Adam. High road, okay?

02:53.912 --> 02:57.829
Let's just live our normal lives
as if she's not even here.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.657
Fresh-squeezed
papaya juice, Kell?

02:59.701 --> 03:01.311
[gasps]

03:01.355 --> 03:03.357
Wow.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.359
Do you make breakfast
like this all the time?

03:05.402 --> 03:08.231
It's like a Four Seasons
in here.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.233
That's a fancy hotel.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.540
[chuckles]:
I know what it is.

03:12.583 --> 03:14.368
I've driven by one.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.197
No, what you're seeing

03:17.240 --> 03:18.676
is just our normal,
everyday life.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.592
I love cooking
for my family.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.246
Mom, my muffin has
a price tag on it.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.856
Honey, put that in your mouth.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.250
[clears throat]
So, um, hey, how did you sleep?

03:27.294 --> 03:28.773
I mean, it's pretty cozy

03:28.817 --> 03:31.907
in a house full of children
and love, huh?

03:31.950 --> 03:33.561
Oh, I slept great.
Oh, but I do

03:33.604 --> 03:35.954
need to go out
and get a memory foam pillow.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.695
I went to the bathroom
last night,

03:37.739 --> 03:40.655
and your pillow completely
forgot how I wanted to sleep.

03:44.441 --> 03:47.618
What's with the spread?
[chuckles]

03:47.662 --> 03:50.230
Oh, shoot. Is it Easter?

03:52.232 --> 03:56.061
No. No, this is just
our regular, typical breakfast.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.063
[chuckles]
We do this every day.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.717
Oh, yeah.
[chuckles]

03:59.761 --> 04:02.503
I meant, "is it Easter?" like,

04:02.546 --> 04:04.331
every day is Easter
with my girl.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.376
Oh...
[laughs]

04:06.420 --> 04:09.379
Oh, kids, I brought you
some presents.

04:09.423 --> 04:13.775
I picked them up on my business
trip last week to Tokyo.

04:13.818 --> 04:18.258
It's just a little something to
say domo arigatofor having me.

04:18.301 --> 04:21.217
Oh, sorry, that means...I know what it means.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.176
That's what you say
to Mr. Roboto.

04:27.179 --> 04:29.138
It's candy.This is so cool.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.575
We never get anything
like this around here.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.882
Uh, I think you're forgetting
about the Tic Tacs

04:33.925 --> 04:36.450
I got for you at the gas station
the other day.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.538
KELLY:
I'm so glad

04:37.581 --> 04:38.756
you like it, kids.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.802
Oh, Tokyo is amazing.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.718
It's modern,
vibrant, cultured.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.110
It's so not your thing.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.809
We don't need
to go to Japan.

04:47.852 --> 04:50.725
[chuckles]: Okay?
We go to Benihana.

04:50.768 --> 04:54.468
[clears throat] Uh, hey, kids,
why don't you go up and play?

04:54.511 --> 04:57.471
Well, I'm off to buy a pillow.

04:57.514 --> 05:00.169
How far is Pittsburgh
from a city?

05:00.212 --> 05:02.737
You know what? Never mind.
I'll Google it.

05:05.043 --> 05:08.656
I don't like this.
She's getting to you.

05:08.699 --> 05:09.831
She is not.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.223
Oh, come on.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.008
I haven't seen that
crystal punch bowl

05:13.051 --> 05:15.445
since you told me to return
it after our wedding.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.144
This is not how we live.

05:23.584 --> 05:26.195
Look, I make breakfast
for you every morning.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.849
Babe.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.894
Yesterday, you put
a frozen Eggo in my pocket

05:29.938 --> 05:32.549
and said my body heat
would warm it up.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.206
Okay, she's getting to me.Mm-hmm.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.687
I didn't sleep
at all last night.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.559
I knew I heard someone
rage-whispering in the bathroom.

05:43.908 --> 05:46.433
I'm just glad it was you
and not the ghost.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.218
[sighs]

05:49.261 --> 05:51.525
Growing up, she was
always like this.

05:51.568 --> 05:54.223
Any toy I had,
her toy was better.

05:54.266 --> 05:57.226
Any sport I played,
her sport was better.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.706
What sport did you play?

05:58.749 --> 06:00.403
Badminton.

06:00.447 --> 06:03.406
Well, you weren't
doing yourself any favors.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.757
Look, if you won't say anything,
then let me do it.

06:06.801 --> 06:09.281
Okay? She needs to know
that there are consequences

06:09.325 --> 06:10.674
when she's mean to you.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.633
Absolutely not, okay?

06:12.676 --> 06:16.158
You stay out of it.
I have my own plan.

06:16.201 --> 06:18.203
At our 50th anniversary party,

06:18.247 --> 06:20.641
when I'm surrounded by
all my grandchildren

06:20.684 --> 06:23.034
and she's in a wheelchair,
hobbled with loneliness,

06:23.078 --> 06:25.210
she'll look at me,
and we'll both know

06:25.254 --> 06:26.429
[whispers]:
I won.

06:29.476 --> 06:32.696
But that'll take forever.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.656
[sighs]

06:35.699 --> 06:40.182
$7.99?

06:40.225 --> 06:43.141
Oh, we're returning these.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.232
â™ª

06:55.719 --> 06:57.242
I can't take much more
of Andi's sister.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.114
I'm trying to get her
out of my house,

06:59.157 --> 07:01.116
Andi's making her
a four-star breakfast.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.945
You don't get rid of rats
by throwing cheese on the floor.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.773
Unless you put poison
in the cheese.

07:05.816 --> 07:08.384
But then you've escalated things
quite a bit.

07:09.516 --> 07:10.995
I'm not a fan of Kelly.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.128
Yeah.When we were Andi's bridesmaids,

07:13.171 --> 07:15.391
she told me that the color
yellow looked good on me

07:15.435 --> 07:17.828
because it matched my teeth.

07:17.872 --> 07:20.657
I let it slide, 'cause I didn't
want to ruin Andi's wedding.

07:20.701 --> 07:21.963
You mean our wedding.

07:22.006 --> 07:24.356
Eh, it was Andi's wedding.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.010
Nobody wants to
look at the groom.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.491
That's why they make you dress
in black, like a roadie.

07:28.535 --> 07:32.539
What I'm thinking is, if we make
life unpleasant for Kelly,

07:32.582 --> 07:35.019
she'll leave, but I can't do it.

07:35.063 --> 07:39.241
No. So what I need is a maker
of unpleasantness, huh?

07:39.284 --> 07:40.982
Which brings me to you, Marcy.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.723
You're really good
at making people

07:42.766 --> 07:43.985
feel bad about themselves.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.988
That is so sweet.

07:47.031 --> 07:49.033
No, I-I'm proud of my skills.
They didn't come easy.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.731
I had to practice on Don.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.168
I'm your speedbag, baby.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.386
So... so you'll do it?

07:54.430 --> 07:55.562
Sure. Sure,
I've had stuff

07:55.605 --> 07:58.216
to say to Kelly
for 18 years.

07:58.260 --> 08:00.436
She has big feet, right?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.743
Oh, you could row
one of her shoes across a lake

08:02.786 --> 08:04.614
like a canoe.[laughter]

08:04.658 --> 08:06.529
Hey, guys.Hey.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.749
What do you got there?They're cookies,
and a woman

08:08.792 --> 08:12.100
gave them to me and she likes me
and I'm not related to her.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.580
[whoops]

08:15.103 --> 08:18.062
Uh... you seeing someone?

08:18.106 --> 08:21.152
I am. Her name is Melanie, and
we met a month ago at the gym

08:21.196 --> 08:23.415
when I became lightheaded
on the StairMaster.

08:23.459 --> 08:26.549
Ooh. A month, huh?
Sounds serious.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.290
Well, I don't like
to kiss and tell,

08:28.333 --> 08:31.946
but I have kissed,
and I must tell you, I liked it.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.339
I know you, Lowell, okay?

08:34.383 --> 08:35.602
Whoever you sleep with,

08:35.645 --> 08:37.604
you're gonna imprint on
like a baby duck.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.214
That's true.

08:39.257 --> 08:41.172
So I think we should
meet this girl.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.696
Maybe you could check her out
and make sure

08:42.739 --> 08:44.001
I'm not blinded by her cookies.

08:44.045 --> 08:47.265
Grow up, Lowell.
They're called knockers.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.615
ADAM:
Hey. [stammers]

08:48.658 --> 08:50.268
Bring her by tonight, okay?

08:50.312 --> 08:52.401
It'll help fill up the room
and distract Andi

08:52.444 --> 08:54.925
from my hit man Marcy.Yeah. You're right.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.144
With Lowell and his lady there,

08:56.187 --> 08:57.319
I'll just be
a face in the crowd.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.886
Exactly. You'll do the hit,

08:58.929 --> 09:00.931
drop the gun,
take the cannoli.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.196
Adam, this is my date Melanie.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.764
Hi. Nice to meet you.

09:07.808 --> 09:11.115
So, uh, what are your
intentions with Lowell?

09:11.159 --> 09:12.943
You know he doesn't
have any money, right?

09:12.987 --> 09:16.599
I figure I'll just take out
some life insurance on him,

09:16.643 --> 09:20.124
put him on a StairMaster
and wait for my payday.

09:20.168 --> 09:22.474
Ah, she's funny.

09:22.518 --> 09:25.347
That's good. Your ex-wife
wasn't very funny.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.959
It's so fun having
your friends over.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.439
It's like a hoedown.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.267
Is there gonna
be a hay ride?

09:33.834 --> 09:35.662
I'll see if I can rustle one up.

09:36.750 --> 09:37.925
ADAM:
So,

09:37.968 --> 09:39.622
tell me about you.Well, I...

09:39.666 --> 09:42.146
Oh, Marcy's here.
Got to go.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.409
You ready for this?Oh, I am more than ready.

09:44.453 --> 09:47.151
We listened to the Rockytheme
the whole way over.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.632
I'm kind of pumped up, myself.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.329
Kelly, hey, uh,

09:51.373 --> 09:53.723
you remember Marcy, don't
you? From our wedding?

09:53.767 --> 09:55.812
Hmm...
Hello, Kelly.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.772
Oh, I didn't
recognize you at first.

09:58.815 --> 10:01.905
Well, people age differently,
and you're doing your best.

10:01.949 --> 10:03.167
Ch...

10:08.390 --> 10:11.132
You just let her walk away.
You didn't even say anything.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.350
I wasn't ready.

10:12.394 --> 10:15.136
She sucker-punched me
before the bell.

10:15.179 --> 10:18.008
I mean, aging is hard,
and I am doing my best.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.663
Okay, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no. Shake it off, champ.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.796
Come on, stay focused.
All right?

10:22.839 --> 10:25.233
Oh! Pretend she's Don.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.453
Yeah, that helps.

10:28.497 --> 10:32.022
You know, sushi isn't
the most popular food in Japan.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.807
It's rom-yon.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.200
You mean ramen?

10:36.244 --> 10:38.289
Oh, we would have
a big laugh in Tokyo

10:38.333 --> 10:42.032
hearing you say it like that.[laughter]

10:42.076 --> 10:45.862
Okay. Hey, who's ready for
another margarita, huh?

10:45.906 --> 10:48.256
Mm. Ooh, look, I am.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.129
Get her, Marcy.

10:52.173 --> 10:55.959
So, Kelly, about what
you said to me before.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.787
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:57.831 --> 11:00.703
What I meant to say was
people age differently,

11:00.747 --> 11:03.053
and you're doing your best.

11:03.097 --> 11:06.230
That's-that's exactly what
you said the first time.

11:06.274 --> 11:07.667
What's up with those two?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.407
Uh, no idea.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.583
You know what, it's okay.

11:11.627 --> 11:13.498
I understand you
lashing out,

11:13.542 --> 11:15.979
seeing your sister
with her wonderful family,

11:16.023 --> 11:17.764
and you all alone.

11:17.807 --> 11:21.115
Mm, it must feel like
such an empty life...

11:21.158 --> 11:23.552
set on top of two
gigantic feet.

11:25.641 --> 11:28.644
Oh, yeah? Well, let me
tell you something.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.645
[chuckling]

11:29.689 --> 11:31.081
You're absolutely right.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.692
[sobs]

11:32.735 --> 11:34.781
Huh?
I'm what, now?

11:34.824 --> 11:36.957
[crying]:
I do have an empty life.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.437
I don't even have a job anymore.

11:39.481 --> 11:40.656
They fired me.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.006
They fired you?
What happened?

11:43.050 --> 11:46.967
I embezzled a tiny bit of money.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.620
Can you believe it?
It's a real

11:48.664 --> 11:50.622
"one strike and you're out"
policy over there.

11:50.666 --> 11:53.930
I-I thought you were in town
for a work conference.

11:53.974 --> 11:55.932
There is no conference.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.935
I came here because Pittsburgh
is the cheapest flight

11:58.979 --> 12:00.981
since nobody wants to come here.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.375
But you said you just
got back from Tokyo.

12:04.419 --> 12:07.770
I lied. I got the kids' candy
at Pier 1.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.773
I'm not even sure it's candy.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.949
It might be little soaps.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.647
I ate three of those.

12:17.171 --> 12:19.739
The truth is I'm jealous of you.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.524
I tried to convince myself
that I was winning,

12:22.567 --> 12:25.875
but I guess this is like
the tortoise and the hare.

12:25.919 --> 12:30.097
I'm the sleek, sexy bunny...

12:30.140 --> 12:34.275
losing to you,
the slow, scaly turtle.

12:34.318 --> 12:37.234
[sobbing]:
I'm gonna go pack.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.760
What happened?

12:40.803 --> 12:42.674
She went down
in the first round.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.894
Adam, you didn't tell me
she had a glass jaw.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.159
Why would Adam tell you
anything about her?

12:49.203 --> 12:50.291
Wait.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.687
Wait, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.951
D-Did you put Marcy
up to this?

12:57.994 --> 13:00.301
Up to what?

13:00.344 --> 13:02.782
Great party, honey.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.133
Adam?
Okay, fine.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.048
I didn't know she was
gonna get so upset.

13:08.091 --> 13:11.007
But you know how many times
I've seen her make you upset?

13:11.051 --> 13:12.530
But that's not the point.
You were supposed to

13:12.574 --> 13:13.880
stay on the high road with me.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.534
Andi! When you met me,
I was in a bar,

13:16.578 --> 13:18.449
passed out in a bowl
of chicken wings.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.975
I don't do "high road."

13:22.018 --> 13:24.064
Okay, but you promised
to stay out of it.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.587
I did stay out of it.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.328
I just put Marcy into it.

13:27.371 --> 13:29.373
I found a loophole.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.984
You're welcome.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.377
I'm not thanking you.Well, I would like you to.

13:33.421 --> 13:34.770
That's why I said
"you're welcome."

13:34.814 --> 13:37.991
Fine. You did the opposite
of what I wanted.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.601
Thank you so much.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.912
That did not seem genuine.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.878
You just stay
right next to Daddy, okay?

13:55.922 --> 13:57.793
As long as you're here,
Mommy can't do

13:57.837 --> 13:59.795
that loud talking
the way she wants to.

13:59.839 --> 14:04.191
Okay? So, when she comes in,
you know what to do?

14:04.234 --> 14:06.280
Pretend to sleep and look cute.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.151
Exactly. Yeah.

14:08.195 --> 14:10.197
Now, when I hear her coming in,

14:10.240 --> 14:13.287
I'll say our code word,
and you close your eyes.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.549
This is fun.

14:14.592 --> 14:15.724
Yeah, isn't it nice
that we could...

14:15.767 --> 14:18.074
[footsteps]Ooh. Potato. Potato.

14:19.641 --> 14:20.990
[quietly]:
Hi. Shh.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.166
I wish we could talk
about tonight,

14:23.210 --> 14:26.300
but we don't want to wake
this sleeping angel.

14:27.388 --> 14:30.043
What can you do? Shh.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.262
Well, I guess, if Emme's asleep,

14:32.306 --> 14:34.786
she can't have the ice cream
that's downstairs.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.966
Emme, where you going?
Potato. Potato. Potato!

14:40.009 --> 14:43.099
Stop shouting vegetables,
all right? I'm not mad at you.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.361
You're not?

14:44.405 --> 14:45.928
No.

14:45.972 --> 14:51.064
I mean, at first I was,
but then I just kept smiling.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.152
And I can admit this to you

14:52.195 --> 14:53.631
because you're
no better than me,

14:53.675 --> 14:57.722
but hearing Kelly say
the words, "I'm jealous,"

14:57.766 --> 15:00.116
was what I've waited for
my whole life.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.641
I mean, I win. I win so much.
And it's all because of you.

15:03.685 --> 15:06.079
Oh, well, hey, well,
you know what I always say.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.298
I'm petty and small,
and you're lucky to have me.

15:08.342 --> 15:10.735
I am. [chuckles]

15:10.779 --> 15:12.476
You know what, I should
go check on Kelly,

15:12.520 --> 15:14.087
make sure she's okay.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.828
[laughing]:
Yeah.

15:16.872 --> 15:19.309
What?
You just want to do
a victory lap.

15:19.353 --> 15:20.789
I kind of do.
I've never had one.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.140
Look, look.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.142
She's still gonna be upset
when we go in there,

15:26.186 --> 15:27.665
so don't feel bad
and start apologizing.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.971
Oh, no, I-I'll be strong.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.494
You know, just
give her a chance

15:30.538 --> 15:32.235
to talk more about
how much she envies me,

15:32.279 --> 15:33.715
and then we'll all get
a good night's sleep.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.850
Hi.
Hi.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.505
You okay, sweetie?

15:41.549 --> 15:42.811
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.598
Well, do you want to talk about

15:47.642 --> 15:49.513
some of the stuff
you were feeling?

15:49.557 --> 15:51.863
Specifically the jealousy.

15:51.907 --> 15:54.954
Or maybe you'd like us
to help you pack.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.260
You said you were
coming up here to pack.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.306
You don't want to say things
and not do 'em.

15:59.349 --> 16:01.786
People might start
to not like you.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.746
Thanks, guys,
but I seriously feel great.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.792
You do?

16:07.836 --> 16:10.012
Well, then, I guess
we'll be going.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.057
Night.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.803
That was no victory lap.

16:18.847 --> 16:21.110
She didn't seem
depressed at all.

16:21.154 --> 16:25.027
If anything, she had a kind
of glow about her.

16:25.071 --> 16:27.377
You know what?

16:27.421 --> 16:29.466
She probably pulled it together
because we knocked.

16:29.510 --> 16:30.859
Let's try surprising her.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.255
[screams]

16:36.604 --> 16:38.606
Is that my daughter's robe?

16:38.649 --> 16:41.130
That's what you notice
about this?

16:42.610 --> 16:44.916
I am spent.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.919
I need an egg and some Gatorade.

16:47.963 --> 16:51.575
You can have treats after you
explain yourself, young man.

16:51.619 --> 16:54.665
What happened to the girl
with the nice cookies?

16:54.709 --> 16:56.276
Melanie.
I dropped her off,

16:56.319 --> 16:58.278
and then I realized
I forgot my phone here.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.584
So I came back to find Kelly
on the porch.

17:00.628 --> 17:01.846
On the porch?

17:01.890 --> 17:03.631
What was she doing
on the porch?

17:03.674 --> 17:07.678
I don't know, but I ran straight
into a sexual tornado.

17:07.722 --> 17:10.116
It was amazing.
She tore my pants off

17:10.159 --> 17:12.857
like I was a basketball player
coming off the bench.

17:12.901 --> 17:17.079
Yeah, she did that in college
to actual basketball players.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.733
Wait-wait a minute,
she was supposed to be

17:18.776 --> 17:21.127
upstairs in her room, crying.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.824
Was she crying on the porch?

17:22.867 --> 17:25.174
No, she was just standing there

17:25.218 --> 17:28.830
tying a cherry stem
into a knot with her tongue.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.964
Sad people don't do that.

17:33.008 --> 17:35.619
You don't think this could be
a setup, do you?

17:35.663 --> 17:38.622
Adam, she...
she's not a monster.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.189
Of course it was a setup.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.627
I hid his phone
so he'd have to come back.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.238
Why would you go to
all that trouble

17:45.281 --> 17:46.891
for some one-night stand?

17:46.935 --> 17:49.633
It was just
a one-night stand, right?

17:49.677 --> 17:52.071
I mean, yes, it was one night,

17:52.114 --> 17:55.074
and we did stand
for a little bit.

18:06.824 --> 18:08.783
Ah.

18:08.826 --> 18:12.134
Okay, tell me it's not
gonna happen again.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.441
Tell me you didn't
"baby duck" her.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.051
Well, we did a lot of things.
I don't know

18:16.095 --> 18:17.487
what the names
of all of them are.

18:17.531 --> 18:22.449
Oh, my God, she's gonna
peel him like an orange.

18:22.492 --> 18:25.016
You're not serious
about Kelly, are you?

18:25.060 --> 18:27.018
I don't know if I'm
serious about her.

18:27.062 --> 18:29.630
I mean, I never want to
be without her again.

18:29.673 --> 18:30.979
I miss her right now.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.372
Is she okay? Is she cold?

18:32.415 --> 18:34.156
Can you give her
my sweater?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.984
But why Lowell?

18:36.027 --> 18:37.290
He's cute.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.509
Forrest Gumpis
my favorite movie.

18:39.553 --> 18:42.860
Plus, he's single and
he already has kids.

18:42.904 --> 18:45.036
He gives me everything
you have, Andi.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.864
But better, because
I didn't have to go through

18:46.908 --> 18:49.389
all that pregnancy stuff,
so I can laugh without peeing.

18:54.263 --> 18:57.919
Looks like the speedy
little bunny wins again.

18:57.962 --> 19:00.487
Wait a minute, wait,
you're still leaving, right?

19:00.530 --> 19:03.316
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.She's not going anywhere, Adam.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.318
She's not jealous,
and she's not going anywhere.

19:05.361 --> 19:08.451
I haven't felt this good
since before I got fired.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.150
Lowell is the solution
to everything.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.673
And I figured that out

19:12.716 --> 19:15.458
thanks to your
yellow-toothed friend Marcy.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.505
But Marcy only talked
to you because of me.

19:18.548 --> 19:21.551
So, you're with Lowell
because of me.

19:21.595 --> 19:24.075
And now you're not leaving
because of me.

19:24.119 --> 19:27.557
I owe it all to you.
Thanks, Adam.

19:27.601 --> 19:30.256
Well, there's your thank-you.

19:30.299 --> 19:31.779
Did you enjoy it?

19:31.822 --> 19:34.738
I think you know I didn't.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.746
What are you barbecuing
at 10:00 in the morning?

19:42.790 --> 19:44.183
Katie's robe.Oh.

19:45.271 --> 19:47.577
Good-bye, all.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.536
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
You're-you're leaving?

19:49.579 --> 19:51.494
I'm moving in with Lowell.

19:51.538 --> 19:54.758
Oh, that poor baby duck.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.891
But you won't miss me too much,
because we're gonna

19:56.934 --> 19:59.154
have you over next week
for rom-yon.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.462
It's ramen, okay?
I called the Japanese embassy.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.899
Yeah, and you didn't
even go to Japan.

20:04.942 --> 20:07.684
That's not how I remember it.
Sayonara.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.124
She might be in
Pittsburgh forever.

20:13.168 --> 20:15.692
Wh-What are we gonna do now?I don't know about you,

20:15.736 --> 20:17.259
but I'm gonna get
in that barbecue grill

20:17.303 --> 20:18.695
and close the lid.

20:18.739 --> 20:21.437
No, no, we are not
giving up, all right?

20:21.481 --> 20:23.700
Our problem is the low road
wasn't low enough.

20:23.744 --> 20:27.051
I know us.
We can get lower.

20:27.095 --> 20:28.836
Now you're talking.

20:28.879 --> 20:32.448
You see, the high road
may be the road to happiness,

20:32.492 --> 20:35.059
but the low road
is the road to revenge.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.713
[chuckles]

20:36.757 --> 20:38.976
I think Gandhi said that.Mm.
