at school today.

Jacinda and another student were
involved in a fatal incident.

-Oh, my God.
-Involving the class axolotl.

14:43.613 --> 14:45.954
Evidently, Jacinda
encouraged a classmate

to feed Mr Scooby
something toxic.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.715
Oh, no.

by Mr Scooby's passing.

I hope a poisoned axolotl is
something they never see again.

with your parents?

of discipline at home.

What did you do with her?

15:34.109 --> 15:35.770
We made a potion.

in her smoky paper.

Ah.

16:32.568 --> 16:34.189
Alright, OK,
so we need to come up

16:34.289 --> 16:36.069

for each paragraph.

in every paragraph.

(MUTTERS) My balls.

16:57.776 --> 17:00.117
There is no way I'm getting
paid enough for this.

17:00.217 --> 17:02.798
More accurately, Gabe,
it is about the themes

in 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.

-Are you serious?

is such a bad influence.

-She looks gorgeous.
-We talked about this.

to put a 4-year-old in...

-I'm basically five.
-..in make-up.

17:32.627 --> 17:34.848
-And she loves it.

down behind the washing machine.

They smell very bad.

17:43.711 --> 17:45.211
No.

17:45.311 --> 17:48.452

and flush them down the toilet.

17:48.552 --> 17:49.973
See, like a human being.

17:50.073 --> 17:53.414

machine, not behind the machine.

to be before Friday!

yourself. She's right here!

poison it with tobacco?"
