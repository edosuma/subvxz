01:07.900 --> 01:10.420
Congratulations.
You're now as fast as us.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.260
I had good coaches.
-And you're a good student.

01:14.780 --> 01:17.980
So, when can I start
to use this thing?

01:18.060 --> 01:19.740
It's not that simple.

01:19.820 --> 01:22.980
Without proper training, moon
rings are incredibly dangerous.

01:23.060 --> 01:26.500
Well, then, someone will have to
teach me how to use it safely.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.420
Any takers?

01:28.500 --> 01:31.420
The pod did appoint you
as an official teacher.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.260
That was for little mermaids.

01:33.340 --> 01:35.740
Are you saying that
you can't teach me?

01:35.820 --> 01:38.540
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course I could teach you.

01:38.620 --> 01:39.780
Good!

01:39.860 --> 01:41.500
When do we start?

01:42.980 --> 01:44.380
Let's go.

01:49.620 --> 01:54.100
The most important thing to learn
about using a moon ring is to focus.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.940
Have a clear idea in your head

01:56.020 --> 01:59.660
of exactly what you want the
object to do, then make it obey.

02:19.020 --> 02:21.580
It takes some people
a while to master,

02:21.660 --> 02:24.820
but don't worry, once you do,
it becomes second nature.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.100
Wow, that's... that's amazing.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.980
Sounds pretty ordinary to me.

02:29.940 --> 02:32.700
This isn't what you'd normally
use a moon ring for.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.020
It holds the power
of the full moon,

02:35.100 --> 02:37.380
so it's used for very complex
and potent magic,

02:37.460 --> 02:40.380
but you have to start small
so you understand how it works.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.540
Once you've mastered that,

02:41.620 --> 02:43.980
we can move onto
more serious applications.

02:44.060 --> 02:45.340
Not all magic is serious.

02:46.620 --> 02:50.820
Mermaids in my pod used to do all
sorts of tricks with their moon rings.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.140
That's your pod, not ours.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.180
What sort of tricks?

02:56.420 --> 02:59.220
They'd shape clumps of seaweed
to look like land people

02:59.300 --> 03:00.940
then make them dance
on top of the water.

03:01.020 --> 03:02.500
That sounds like fun.

03:02.580 --> 03:04.020
Ondina and I did
something similar

03:04.100 --> 03:05.420
when we first got
our moon rings.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.940
No, we didn't.
-Yes, we did.

03:08.020 --> 03:10.940
We used to freeze water in the
shapes of giant sea creatures,

03:11.020 --> 03:13.300
put them in front of boats
and then shatter them.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.500
It was so funny
watching the fishermen react.

03:16.580 --> 03:19.340
Sounds like a very serious use
of your moon rings.

03:19.980 --> 03:22.940
Obviously,
that was some other mermaid.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.860
Ondina,
you even named the trick.

03:25.940 --> 03:28.140
You called it "Freezy Scare."

03:29.740 --> 03:32.860
Even if I had done that,
I certainly wouldn't do it now.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.220
Moon rings are not toys.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.540
Now, back to the lesson.

03:43.980 --> 03:47.500
Remember, Evie,
it's all about focus and intent.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.100
Now you try it.

03:54.380 --> 03:55.780
Joe, we have to talk about this.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.340
There's nothing to talk about,
all right?

03:57.420 --> 03:59.300
The decision's been made.
-You made the decision.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.500
I wasn't even consulted.
That's not fair.

04:01.580 --> 04:02.580
What's not fair?

04:02.660 --> 04:05.060
Joe wants to close the café.
Tell him he can't.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.260
No way. This place is awesome.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.900
Look, there are plenty of places you
can get burgers and juice, you know.

04:08.980 --> 04:11.100
You know this place is
more than just a café.

04:11.180 --> 04:12.940
It's like a community.
People rely on it.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.420
Yeah,
especially young people like us.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.420
We need it to...

04:17.500 --> 04:18.820
keep us off the streets.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.380
Does it look like
I wanna run a youth center?

04:20.459 --> 04:21.700
It's still a good business.

04:21.779 --> 04:24.140
Yeah, and my fishing boat
is a better one, okay?

04:24.220 --> 04:26.380
I use the cash I've got tied
up here to buy new equipment,

04:26.460 --> 04:29.020
I'm going to make even more money.
-Not everything's about money.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.460
That's a good one.
I'm going to have to use that.

04:34.540 --> 04:38.700
Sorry, guys, as of Friday,
this place is over.

04:42.860 --> 04:44.300
How does he get to make
the decision anyway?

04:44.380 --> 04:45.500
You're half-owner.

04:45.580 --> 04:49.100
Yeah, but without his half, I don't
have the money to run the place.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.420
If he pulls the plug, that's it.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.660
Hey, Dad.

05:02.740 --> 05:04.620
If you're looking for a cup,
you might try the sink.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.300
I thought we had an agreement.

05:09.380 --> 05:12.340
I take care of the bathroom,
you do the kitchen.

05:12.420 --> 05:14.900
I meant to be back and have
it done before you got up,

05:14.980 --> 05:17.660
but... I lost track of time.

05:17.740 --> 05:19.860
Well, where were you so early?

05:19.940 --> 05:22.500
Just went for a swim.
-Mmm.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.140
That's every morning this week.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.380
Look, I don't want to
stop you having free time

05:26.460 --> 05:28.180
but you need to do
your bit around here.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.820
I know.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.100
Honey, we're a team, yeah?

05:32.180 --> 05:34.620
We've got to act like a team,
back each other up.

05:36.300 --> 05:37.620
I'm sorry, Dad.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.020
All right.

05:39.100 --> 05:43.580
Well, I've got a charter to take
out, and I'll see you tonight.

05:43.660 --> 05:45.460
Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

05:58.380 --> 05:59.500
Hmm.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.260
"Have a clear idea of
what you want it to do.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.580
Now make it obey."

06:53.980 --> 06:56.660
It's not gonna be
the same without the café.

06:56.740 --> 06:58.740
All the great times
we've had here.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.340
All the great girls
I've met here...

07:00.980 --> 07:02.540
none of which compare to Carly.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.500
Oh, no.
-What?

07:12.020 --> 07:13.620
Evie's going to lose her shop.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.340
Carly's going to lose her job.

07:15.420 --> 07:16.820
Well, that settles it.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.180
We have to find a way
to keep this place open.

07:18.260 --> 07:21.220
It shouldn't be a problem for
a couple of smart guys like us.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.260
Must be somewhere
we can all hang out.

07:24.780 --> 07:28.180
It doesn't have to be fancy.
-It doesn't even have to be a café.

07:28.260 --> 07:31.980
Hmm. Personally speaking,
no food is a deal breaker.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.980
Well, it wouldn't have to be
somewhere we buy food.

07:35.060 --> 07:37.620
We could cook our own.
Like a barbecue.

07:38.260 --> 07:40.180
We could bring our own drinks.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.260
We could use my bungalow.

07:42.340 --> 07:44.540
Can't wait to see
what your olds think about that.

07:47.380 --> 07:48.620
Well, where's your bright ideas?

07:51.260 --> 07:52.260
I...

07:53.740 --> 07:55.980
can't think on an empty stomach.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.660
You're right.

08:25.060 --> 08:26.340
Slow down!

08:27.460 --> 08:28.460
Stop!

08:29.140 --> 08:30.580
Stop, you stupid thing!

08:55.020 --> 08:56.140
We could hold an auction.

08:56.220 --> 08:57.820
I like it.
What are we auctioning?

08:57.900 --> 08:59.100
You and me.

08:59.620 --> 09:00.700
We'd be servants for a day.

09:00.780 --> 09:02.340
What would we do?

09:03.700 --> 09:06.340
Anything the person
who bought us wanted.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.140
Anything?
-Anything.

09:09.220 --> 09:10.260
Within reason.

09:10.340 --> 09:13.580
Okay, we should make a list 'cause
there's some things the Camster won't do.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.740
I have allergies.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.580
It was just an idea.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.060
Not one of your better ones.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.820
I'm still not hearing
anything from you.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.860
I better call Evie,
tell her the bad news.

09:41.460 --> 09:42.820
Did David tell you?

09:43.740 --> 09:44.820
Yep.

09:46.220 --> 09:47.980
Bummer, hey?

09:48.060 --> 09:49.180
Yeah.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.420
Banana and strawberry smoothie.

09:55.980 --> 09:57.500
You're taking this pretty well.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.900
Nothing I can do.

09:59.980 --> 10:02.420
That's pretty mature.
I thought you'd be cut.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.780
You're always telling me
how much you like working here.

10:04.860 --> 10:06.540
We need more strawberries.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.820
I don't think Joe has any idea
what damage he's doing.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.940
I mean,
there's Evie's shop to consider.

10:18.020 --> 10:19.820
Strawberries are
supposed to be right here.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.340
Where are they?

10:21.420 --> 10:23.060
They're right in front of you.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.060
And then there's your singing.

10:25.140 --> 10:27.900
I mean, you only just got started
in your new career and pow!

10:27.980 --> 10:29.220
It's out the window.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.620
How tragic is that?

10:32.940 --> 10:35.260
It's okay,
they're only strawberries.

10:35.340 --> 10:37.100
It's not the strawberries!

10:38.500 --> 10:41.300
This is the best job
that I'll ever have.

10:42.420 --> 10:46.340
Anywhere else...
and I won't get to sing.

10:46.420 --> 10:49.340
The customers will just
be customers, not friends.

10:50.620 --> 10:51.620
It's not fair.

10:52.580 --> 10:53.700
It'll be okay.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.100
No, it won't.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.540
Yes, it will.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.740
Just don't ask me how.

11:16.860 --> 11:17.900
Zac.

11:17.980 --> 11:19.380
Hey, Evie.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.220
I've got something to tell you.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.660
Is Mimmi or Ondina there?

11:22.740 --> 11:24.700
Uh, no, no.

11:24.780 --> 11:27.460
Hey, listen,
I've got some really bad news.

11:27.540 --> 11:29.700
Yeah, so do I.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.020
Evie, I'm sorry but
the café is closing.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.860
<i>Just find the mermaids</i>
<i>and get them here...</i>

11:34.940 --> 11:36.700
quick!

12:02.780 --> 12:04.460
Good mop.

12:04.540 --> 12:06.220
Nice mop.

12:09.220 --> 12:10.540
No!

12:22.660 --> 12:25.220
Got a sec?
-I'm kind of busy.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.700
See, I'm wondering if you've really
thought this whole thing through.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.580
What's there to think about?

12:31.660 --> 12:35.580
Closing the café has...
a tremendous social cost.

12:35.660 --> 12:38.340
Meaning what exactly?

12:38.420 --> 12:40.420
You know how many couples met
at the Ocean Café?

12:40.500 --> 12:43.460
How many first dates happened there?
-Well, they can happen somewhere else.

12:43.540 --> 12:44.620
What about your employees,

12:44.700 --> 12:46.340
who have given you
years of loyal service,

12:46.420 --> 12:48.420
worked their fingers to the bone
without complaints?

12:48.500 --> 12:52.140
You can't just dump them on the street.
-Can you stop this sob-sister routine?

12:52.220 --> 12:54.300
They can find jobs elsewhere.
-Times are tough, Joe.

12:54.380 --> 12:55.380
Jobs don't grow on trees.

12:55.460 --> 12:59.420
I am not running a charity. I'm
in business to make a profit.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.460
So, if you're here offering
to buy my share, start talking.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.940
I thought not.

13:24.380 --> 13:25.780
So what's the big emergency?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.340
Look.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.140
I can't even get
into my own house.

13:36.220 --> 13:38.140
You didn't--
-I know.

13:38.220 --> 13:39.940
Moon rings are dangerous.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.940
I shouldn't have used it
until I was trained.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.820
I thought Ondina was
giving you lessons.

13:43.900 --> 13:45.980
I don't even know
why you're here.

13:46.060 --> 13:49.020
Can we just stop this thing
before my dad gets home?

13:49.100 --> 13:51.220
There has to be a fix.
It's just a mop, right?

13:51.300 --> 13:52.340
I don't know a lot about mops.

13:52.420 --> 13:54.980
We don't have
much use for them underwater.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.740
What exactly did you do to it?

13:56.820 --> 13:58.780
I was getting it to
clean the floors.

13:58.860 --> 14:01.660
It got stuck in the bucket,
so I just gave it an extra jolt.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.300
Come on.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.420
Psst!

15:00.100 --> 15:01.940
Evie!

15:05.780 --> 15:08.700
Stop it!
- It's getting away!

15:08.780 --> 15:11.980
It's going to mop the entire
street. We have to stop it!

15:14.340 --> 15:15.900
Hi, Joe.

15:15.980 --> 15:18.860
What part of "I'm not running a
charity" don't you understand?

15:18.940 --> 15:19.980
I understand perfectly.

15:20.060 --> 15:21.900
You're a businessman
and you're running a business.

15:21.980 --> 15:22.980
So?

15:23.500 --> 15:25.900
So, I thought you might like
to hear a business proposition.

15:25.980 --> 15:29.100
From you?
-Why not?

15:29.180 --> 15:32.820
Since you are a businessman, can
you really afford not to listen?

15:36.540 --> 15:39.100
Sorry, I'm afraid we can't
take orders for next week.

15:39.180 --> 15:42.660
Friday's our--
-Hi, sorry about that.

15:42.740 --> 15:43.940
What day were you looking at?

15:44.020 --> 15:45.980
Tuesday? Fine.

15:46.900 --> 15:48.740
And what would you like?

15:49.620 --> 15:52.500
Uh-huh. Yep.

15:52.580 --> 15:56.820
Four seafood platters, ready
first thing for pick-up Tuesday.

15:56.900 --> 15:59.180
Not a problem. See you then.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.900
Are you nuts?
What are you doing?

16:02.980 --> 16:07.140
The café closes Friday, remember?
-Really? That's not what I heard.

16:07.740 --> 16:09.940
Word is the café's
got a new co-owner.

16:10.020 --> 16:11.580
What?
-Who?

16:13.740 --> 16:15.940
You're kidding. You?

16:16.020 --> 16:18.260
That's right, partner.

16:18.340 --> 16:19.540
Where did you get the money?

16:19.620 --> 16:23.420
I used my savings,
and also a loan from my dad.

16:23.500 --> 16:24.980
Actually,
mostly a loan from my dad.

16:25.060 --> 16:27.260
Why would your dad
give you a loan?

16:27.340 --> 16:29.860
He said it was a good way for me
to learn how business works.

16:29.940 --> 16:31.620
Also, I begged him.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.660
You saved the café.

16:33.740 --> 16:35.140
And my job.

16:35.740 --> 16:37.780
Just doing what
any hero would do.

16:37.860 --> 16:40.180
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

16:41.180 --> 16:42.940
I owe you, Cam.

16:43.020 --> 16:44.060
Think nothing of it.

16:44.140 --> 16:46.140
Look, if there's anything I
can do, anything at all...

16:46.220 --> 16:49.700
Actually... there is one thing.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.100
Name it.

16:51.780 --> 16:53.740
I'm pretty thirsty.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.940
One large tropical
juice coming right up.

16:58.100 --> 17:01.940
Actually, better make it a small. Don't
want to eat into our profits, do we?

17:11.220 --> 17:14.020
Where do you even start looking
for a runaway mop?

17:14.660 --> 17:18.540
Somewhere with dirty floors
or good-looking buckets?

17:20.380 --> 17:21.619
Come on.

17:23.660 --> 17:25.420
Here mop, mop, mop.

17:26.819 --> 17:29.860
Here, moppie.
-I really doubt that's going to work.

17:48.140 --> 17:49.220
Gotcha!

17:57.980 --> 17:59.020
Zac!

18:04.140 --> 18:05.660
This ends now.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.620
What's the plan?

18:30.420 --> 18:31.860
Anybody got an idea?

18:33.500 --> 18:35.660
Don't be shy. Speak up.

18:38.220 --> 18:39.460
Ondina.

18:41.260 --> 18:44.100
Freezy Scare.
-Let's do it.

19:02.860 --> 19:06.180
Yes!
-That is one ex-mop.

19:06.260 --> 19:08.140
We rock.

19:08.220 --> 19:10.940
Yes, we do.

19:23.020 --> 19:24.300
Mmm, very nice.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.300
And so is this.
You've done a fantastic job.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.620
Just being a team player.

19:32.220 --> 19:33.740
Uh, Dad.

19:33.820 --> 19:35.300
Oops.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.100
Sorry.

19:37.180 --> 19:38.620
Now who's letting the team down?

19:38.700 --> 19:41.060
Ah, just... just leave it.
I'll do it.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.100
No, no.
You've done your fair share.

19:45.420 --> 19:46.780
Have you seen the mop?

19:54.500 --> 19:56.220
What do you think?
-Perfect.

19:57.980 --> 20:01.540
I think I need a necklace.
-You never wear necklaces.

20:01.620 --> 20:04.100
What do you think?
-I like it.

20:04.180 --> 20:05.820
You should wear it.
-Hmm.

20:07.220 --> 20:10.180
Evie certainly got the hang
of her moon ring fast.

20:10.260 --> 20:13.100
I agree. She has great ability.

20:13.180 --> 20:14.900
Although, she did have
a pretty good teacher.

20:16.060 --> 20:20.060
Who may have instilled a slight sense
of overconfidence in her student.

20:20.140 --> 20:23.700
All right,
I admit Evie went a bit far,

20:23.780 --> 20:27.300
but I'll be there to keep an eye on
her, make sure she stays on track.

20:27.380 --> 20:29.660
And Mimmi and I will be there
to keep an eye on you

20:29.740 --> 20:31.700
and make sure you
don't get into trouble.

20:34.580 --> 20:35.940
That necklace...

20:36.860 --> 20:38.060
I wouldn't.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.060
Hmm.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.100
Ladies, gentlemen and others...

20:53.180 --> 20:55.260
I'd like to welcome
you all here tonight,

20:55.340 --> 20:57.980
the first of many special nights
here at the Ocean Café.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.340
As some of you may know...

21:03.420 --> 21:05.420
we've had a recent
change of management here.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.780
A forward thinking co-owner has agreed
to come on board and shake things up.

21:08.860 --> 21:11.900
I'm sure you're all wondering
who this generous benefactor is--

21:11.980 --> 21:13.020
That's you, Cam.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.580
And the spoiler award
goes to Zac Blakely.

21:17.260 --> 21:18.460
As I was saying,

21:18.540 --> 21:21.020
we're planning many changes,
the first of which...

21:21.100 --> 21:22.580
our new house band.

21:27.140 --> 21:29.940
Now, I'd like to throw over to a voice
that we are all very familiar with,

21:30.020 --> 21:31.260
especially when
she's yelling that

21:31.340 --> 21:33.300
the toasted
sandwiches are burnt.

21:33.380 --> 21:34.900
Carly.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.100
Go Carly.
-Go Carly.

21:36.180 --> 21:37.420
Whoo!

21:42.820 --> 21:44.740
Uh, I'd like to
dedicate this first song

21:44.820 --> 21:47.380
to the guy that made
all of this possible.

21:48.060 --> 21:50.740
I know that he thinks
he's special, but...

21:50.820 --> 21:53.020
he doesn't know
just how special he is.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.300
One, two, three.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.860
<i>* Just can't think
of any other way *</i>

22:00.460 --> 22:02.300
<i>* Just not giving up *</i>

22:02.860 --> 22:05.460
<i>* Just not giving up *</i>

22:06.300 --> 22:09.700

<i>That I can say *</i>

22:09.780 --> 22:11.940

22:12.020 --> 22:14.100

22:14.180 --> 22:15.500
<i>* Without you *</i>

22:15.580 --> 22:19.980
<i>* Just can't get away *</i>

22:20.060 --> 22:24.820
<i>* Find another way *</i>

22:26.100 --> 22:28.820
<i>* You're everything to me *</i>

22:30.180 --> 22:33.820
<i>* You're everything
when I'm with you *</i>

22:33.900 --> 22:38.060
<i>* Just can't get away *</i>

22:38.700 --> 22:43.020
<i>* Find another way *</i>

22:46.820 --> 22:48.620

22:48.700 --> 22:49.940

22:50.020 --> 22:53.340

23:07.300 --> 23:08.340

23:08.420 --> 23:10.380
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:10.460 --> 23:11.620
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:11.700 --> 23:14.060
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:14.140 --> 23:15.700
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:15.780 --> 23:18.420

23:18.500 --> 23:20.780

23:20.860 --> 23:22.300

23:33.820 --> 23:35.100

23:35.180 --> 23:36.660

23:36.740 --> 23:38.140

23:38.220 --> 23:40.460
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:40.540 --> 23:41.940
<i>* Together *</i>

23:42.020 --> 23:43.820
<i>* Forever *</i>

23:43.900 --> 23:47.060

in the sun *</i>

23:47.140 --> 23:48.740

23:48.820 --> 23:50.340

23:50.420 --> 23:51.620

23:51.700 --> 23:55.100

23:56.780 --> 23:59.340
