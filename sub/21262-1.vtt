08:09.021 --> 08:10.923
And that's what
makes it fly.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.692
Are we close?

08:10.990 --> 08:12.692
Rainbow kind of art.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.427
Yeah, we're close.

08:12.758 --> 08:14.427
I've been here before.

08:14.493 --> 08:15.761
Oh, that's it, on the left.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.797
Who does that?
Who parks like that?

08:17.864 --> 08:19.498
That's Melissa's car.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.568
Why does she have
a handicapped placard?

08:22.635 --> 08:24.303
What? What is that look?

08:24.370 --> 08:26.939
I'm just...
I'm just sayin'.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.274
What?

08:28.341 --> 08:31.510
Maybe she can't walk
very far.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.179
Maybe her butthole
fell out.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.414
Jesus!

08:33.246 --> 08:35.414
What? It happens!

08:35.481 --> 08:36.782
It happened to my stepmom!

08:36.849 --> 08:39.685
That is not a true story.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.685
I protected you from that.

08:39.752 --> 08:41.888
It is a serious
condition, okay?

08:41.954 --> 08:45.124
It happens-- there's, like,
repeated trauma in the area.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.193
Mmm...

08:45.191 --> 08:47.193
I mean, hers wasn't that trauma,

08:47.260 --> 08:50.429
but, like, babies, but it's
called a rectal prolapse.

08:50.496 --> 08:53.366
It's very common
for women in their 50's.

08:53.432 --> 08:56.202
Listen-- in ten years
my butthole could fall out.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.304
And that's
when I'm gone.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.072
[chuckles]

08:58.371 --> 09:00.072
Mommy...

09:00.139 --> 09:02.742
What are you talking about?

09:02.808 --> 09:05.378
Just a pretend person
from an old book.

09:07.079 --> 09:11.617
[kids shouting and laughing,
party music playing]

09:11.684 --> 09:15.354
Whoa!
I think we went under the sea!

09:15.421 --> 09:16.956
You guys made it!

09:15.421 --> 09:16.956
Hi!

09:17.023 --> 09:21.060
Oh, my gosh, Chelsea's so
excited that Amelia could come!

09:21.127 --> 09:23.696
She looks ecstatic.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.696
Yeah.

09:23.763 --> 09:24.997
And where do I put this?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.833
The gift table-- honey,
get up and enjoy your party!

09:27.900 --> 09:30.169
Get in the bounce house.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.904
Go in the bounce house.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.673
Jesus! Do you want to take
your purse inside?

09:33.739 --> 09:34.874
Oh, I'll keep it.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.242
I'm waiting for
a call from my doctor.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.177
Ooh, what's wrong?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.177
Nothing.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.879
Hmm, it seems weird
for a Saturday.

09:39.946 --> 09:42.515
It's just results from
my physical.

09:42.581 --> 09:43.983
What do you think
they're calling about?

09:44.050 --> 09:45.985
AIDS, cancer, diabetes.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.454
Wow.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.454
Wow, oh, I don't know,

09:48.521 --> 09:50.923
I don't think so.
I appreciate the concern.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.558
Well, I want you guys
to enjoy yourselves.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.227
[whispering]
Molly's mom has bruises

09:55.294 --> 09:57.263
on her chin from filler.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.497
You're gonna want to
check that out,

09:58.564 --> 10:00.499
but don't stare,
okay?

10:00.566 --> 10:02.835
Have fun,
there's wine inside.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.037
Wine-- its ten a.m.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.942
There's Melissa.

10:10.009 --> 10:13.245
Oh, there she is...
in all of her glory.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.014
She looks smaller in person.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.416
What does-- how much
of that stuff did you watch?

10:17.483 --> 10:20.586
I like, scanned it,
you know, for research.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.989
Really? Research.

10:23.055 --> 10:25.491
A-ringa-dinga-ding, right?

10:25.558 --> 10:27.026
This is why
I don't tell you stuff.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.996
I mean, it's just surprising,
it's a little spicy.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.098
But you know I'm never doing
that in the butt, right?

10:32.164 --> 10:34.633
Not until you're 78.

10:32.164 --> 10:34.633
What?

10:34.700 --> 10:36.669
When we were dating you said
you would do it in 50 years...

10:36.736 --> 10:38.838
No.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.838
12 down, 38 more to go.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.774
Well, first of all, how did you
even remember that?

10:41.841 --> 10:43.042
You don't even remember
your mom's birthday--

10:43.109 --> 10:44.577
this you can't
get out of your mind?

10:44.643 --> 10:45.978
Some stuff sticks
more than others.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.650
You know what?

10:51.717 --> 10:55.021
I'm starting to see why
she went all butt all the time.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.790
She doesn't have a lot to work
with on the top floor.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.359
So?

10:57.857 --> 11:00.359
So, if she's choosing porn

11:00.426 --> 11:03.396
as her profession and she
doesn't have the boobs for it...

11:03.462 --> 11:05.131
What?

11:03.462 --> 11:05.131
It's like a champion swimmer

11:05.197 --> 11:07.333
who's got strong legs
and weak arms.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.601
They bank on the legs.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.037
That makes sense.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.037
Yeah.

11:11.103 --> 11:12.271
Oh.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.206
Oh, this is a nice bag.
This looks like a...

11:14.273 --> 11:16.475
I think I've seen this
at Target, this bag.

11:16.542 --> 11:17.710
They just don't
prepare you for this stuff

11:17.777 --> 11:18.978
in the parenting books.

11:19.045 --> 11:21.080
No, they do not.

11:21.147 --> 11:23.616
[kids shouting and laughing,
party music playing]

11:26.952 --> 11:29.822
Obviously, I like
Cinderella too, who doesn't?

11:29.889 --> 11:31.223
But I just wish, you know,

11:31.290 --> 11:33.692
maybe if she had stood up to her
stepsisters and stepmother

11:33.759 --> 11:37.463
and said, "Hey, you can't
talk to me like that."

11:37.530 --> 11:38.464
Nope.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.698
Oh.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.867
I like princesses
'cause they're...

11:41.934 --> 11:44.470
'cause they're pretty and...

11:41.934 --> 11:44.470
Uh-huh.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.540
They have pretty
dresses and...

11:47.606 --> 11:50.209
[whispering]
...take whatever you want.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.277
What?

11:51.343 --> 11:53.679
[whispering]
Take whatever you want.

11:53.746 --> 11:55.214
[whispering]
Get whatever you want?

11:55.281 --> 11:57.783
Mm-hmm.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.351
Cool.

11:59.418 --> 12:02.388
We already started putting
money aside for Izzy's therapy.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.957
Uh, mermaid tears?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.957
No, thank you.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.659
Appreciate it.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.659
Uh-huh.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.160
[phone buzzing]

12:06.725 --> 12:08.160
Hey, someone's phone's buzzing.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.029
Who's got a phone?

12:08.227 --> 12:10.029
Oh! That's me, that's me.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.797
I'm playing phone tag
with my doctor.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.365
On a Saturday?

12:11.864 --> 12:13.365
Yes.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.668
Shoot.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.303
Hey, is everything okay?

12:15.734 --> 12:17.303
[call ringing through]

12:17.369 --> 12:20.506
Yes, Brian, it's not abnormal
for a doctor to call

12:20.573 --> 12:22.541
with positive
to neutral news.

12:22.608 --> 12:23.943
[woman on phone]
<i>Dr. Katzberg's office.</i>

12:24.009 --> 12:26.145
Hi, yes, it's Andrea Warren.
The doctor just called?

12:26.212 --> 12:27.580
I'm sorry,
she's with a patient.

12:27.646 --> 12:29.949
<i>Oh, God, you guys</i>
<i>have a busy practice.</i>

12:30.015 --> 12:32.318
What, are you giving
out free OxyContin?

12:32.384 --> 12:33.752
If you are,
save me one.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.254
Are you looking
for OxyContin?

12:35.321 --> 12:36.555
I'm-- I was just joking.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.057
Would you like me
to tell the doctor

12:38.124 --> 12:39.859
<i>that Andrea Warren called</i>
<i>for OxyContin, is that--</i>

12:39.925 --> 12:42.561
No, no, no, no, I was
making a-- I was just, like,

12:42.628 --> 12:44.897
it's so popular,
you know, like "ha-ha".

12:44.964 --> 12:47.032
I know it's a controlled
substance and I don't,

12:47.099 --> 12:48.734
I don't take that kind
of thing lightly.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.936
Is that the doctor?

12:48.801 --> 12:50.936
No, the nurse.

12:51.003 --> 12:53.873
Can't she tell you
what's wrong?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.341
Um, I know the doctor's
just calling me

12:55.407 --> 12:56.542
with my physical results.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.077
Can you just give them
to me over the phone?

12:58.144 --> 13:00.679
I'm sorry, I'm not authorized
to divulge that information.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.915
She's not authorized to give it.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.915
Ask her if you sign something...

13:02.982 --> 13:04.617
Well, how am I--

13:02.982 --> 13:04.617
...if you sign something.

13:04.683 --> 13:06.452
Listen, I...

13:04.683 --> 13:06.452
You can sign something

13:06.519 --> 13:09.054
and send it over,
I have an app on my phone.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.456
Seriously?

13:10.523 --> 13:11.824
Authorize--

13:10.523 --> 13:11.824
Why don't you hold
for the doctor?

13:11.891 --> 13:13.025
She'll call you back.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.428
She'll call me back.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.428
That's not good.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.631
[scoffs]

13:16.495 --> 13:18.631
You should drive there.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.266
What?

13:18.697 --> 13:20.266
Yeah.

13:20.332 --> 13:21.467
Not a terrible idea.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.736
Oh, thank you, Brian,
for chiming in.

13:23.802 --> 13:24.837
I'm gonna wait
for her call.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.338
I'm going to get
some water.

13:26.405 --> 13:27.406
Mermaid tears!

13:26.405 --> 13:27.406
Nope.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.290
Hi.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.290
Okay, you better stop.

13:44.356 --> 13:45.858
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

13:45.925 --> 13:48.861
I'm just--
I'm fascinated by it.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.263
I have so many questions.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.263
Okay.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.432
I mean, you've seen
the videos,

13:53.499 --> 13:57.636
apparently quite a few of them,
but the shape she must be in.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.371
She seems agile,
though, right?

13:59.438 --> 14:01.907
And she's wearing a white pant,
I mean, that's a bold choice.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.042
I wouldn't even wear
white pants.

14:03.108 --> 14:04.210
You are a child.

14:04.276 --> 14:08.714
Oh, well,
that makes you a pedophile.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.249
Should I call
Child Protective Services...

14:10.316 --> 14:11.550
Okay, okay.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.550
...'cause this doesn't seem

14:11.617 --> 14:13.352
safe for you.

14:13.419 --> 14:15.254
Oh, my God,
what is she doing here?

14:15.321 --> 14:16.655
That's the lady
who yelled at me

14:16.722 --> 14:18.123
for swearing
at dance class.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.225
Diane?

14:19.291 --> 14:20.526
Who?

14:19.291 --> 14:20.526
It's Opal's grandma.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.694
You never met her at drop-off?

14:20.593 --> 14:21.694
No.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.596
She's the sweetest
lady in the world.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.699
Hi.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.699
Huh.

14:26.765 --> 14:28.801
Oh, my God,
this is so stupid.

14:28.867 --> 14:30.002
I'll be right back.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.441
Hi, it's me.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.142
Dance class potty mouth.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.511
You're Opal's grandma?

14:37.209 --> 14:39.511
Yes.

14:39.578 --> 14:40.813
Wow, small world.

14:40.879 --> 14:42.348
Hi, Opal!

14:44.116 --> 14:46.418
Listen, um,
I just wanted to say

14:46.485 --> 14:48.420
that I'm so sorry about what
happened the other day.

14:48.487 --> 14:50.856
It was hot,
I was trying to be nice.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.525
Why did you use
that language?

14:53.592 --> 14:56.762
Well, again, and I'm not
making any excuses,

14:56.829 --> 14:58.464
but she was the one
who used the language,

14:58.530 --> 15:02.668
I was just quoting her, so, you
know, people knew what was...

15:02.735 --> 15:05.204
I would never even
talk like that.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.506
I don't talk like that.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.506
Hmm.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.009
I'm really sorry
if I offended you.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.545
Well, that's okay.

15:13.612 --> 15:15.247
Thank you for apologizing.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.082
Well, thank you for
accepting my apology.

15:17.149 --> 15:19.718
Mm-hmm.

15:19.785 --> 15:21.153
'Cause it was
pretty hot in there.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.955
Yeah.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.524
People were sweating.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.524
Oh.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.626
You were sweating.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.626
Hey, Diane!

15:27.693 --> 15:28.894
Hi.

15:27.693 --> 15:28.894
I'm so glad you could make it.

15:28.961 --> 15:30.562
Could I steal her for a second?

15:28.961 --> 15:30.562
Sure.

15:30.629 --> 15:31.697
Okay, we'll be right back.

15:30.629 --> 15:31.697
I'll be right back.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.731
All right.

15:32.798 --> 15:33.866
What, what, what?

15:33.932 --> 15:35.834
What has happened?

15:35.901 --> 15:38.604
Are you okay?

15:38.671 --> 15:42.408
[whispering]
Maddie's mom was a porn star.

15:42.474 --> 15:44.143
[whispering]
Oh, yeah, I know.

15:44.209 --> 15:45.177
You know?

15:45.244 --> 15:46.345
Yeah, I knew before.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.680
You've known and you
didn't tell me?

15:47.746 --> 15:48.681
No, I didn't.

15:48.747 --> 15:49.882
Why wouldn't you tell me?

15:49.948 --> 15:52.451
Do you hear the glee
in your voice right now?

15:52.518 --> 15:55.254
Yeah!

15:52.518 --> 15:55.254
That's why I didn't tell you.

15:55.321 --> 15:56.789
Wait-- how do you know?

15:56.855 --> 15:59.258
Someone just sent an email to
the entire class outing her...

15:59.325 --> 16:00.726
What?

15:59.325 --> 16:00.726
...saying that it goes

16:00.793 --> 16:03.395
against our family values
and that we should all boycott

16:03.462 --> 16:06.732
the school picnic if Melissa's
gonna be there-- it's amazing!

16:06.799 --> 16:08.600
This is bullshit.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.600
I know.

16:08.667 --> 16:11.170
What, are they worried she's
gonna use our kids for fluffers?

16:11.236 --> 16:12.771
Yeah-- I don't-- yes.

16:12.838 --> 16:13.839
What's a fluffer?

16:13.906 --> 16:15.341
What if her kid's here?

16:15.407 --> 16:17.576
Well, the sex talk
will be easier.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.944
Oh, will it?

16:17.643 --> 16:18.944
'cause they can just play

16:19.011 --> 16:20.045
a video of mom.

16:20.112 --> 16:21.647
Who sent that email?

16:21.714 --> 16:24.950
It's an anonymous email,
a fake person-- Horselover3000.

16:25.017 --> 16:26.352
They're outing her

16:26.418 --> 16:27.853
but they don't even have
the balls to sign it themselves?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.488
You make a good point.

16:29.555 --> 16:30.856
Who in our class
is into horses?

16:30.923 --> 16:32.825
Fuck if I know.
I've been thinking about it.

16:32.891 --> 16:35.761
Sarah had that party with those
mini ponies, like, a year ago.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.829
But that's a pony...

16:36.895 --> 16:39.932
Chelsea! Chelsea!

16:39.998 --> 16:42.468
Why do I even
throw you a party?

16:42.534 --> 16:44.970
Get up and play.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.711
Has anyone here seen
"War Horse"?

16:52.778 --> 16:55.781
I heard it's a very
provocative film, you know,

16:55.848 --> 16:57.449
a lot of horses,
real horses.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.450
Hey, Andrea.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.651
I have to run
to the bathroom.

16:59.718 --> 17:01.019
Could you just keep
an eye on Maddie for me?

17:01.086 --> 17:02.054
Yeah.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.356
Hey, take your time
in there.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.558
Whatever you need,
I've got Maddie.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.127
Cool, thank you.

17:09.728 --> 17:12.131
Did any of you watch
the Triple Crown?

17:12.197 --> 17:15.267
I mean, a Clydesdale,
that is a majestic animal.

17:15.334 --> 17:17.903
We're thinking of sending Amelia
to a horse camp this summer.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.505
Is that something
you guys have ever done?

17:19.571 --> 17:21.807
So I heard that horses
have the largest eyes

17:21.874 --> 17:23.342
of any land mammals.

17:23.409 --> 17:26.378
Does that seem
right to you?

17:26.445 --> 17:28.981
[phone dinging]

17:29.048 --> 17:30.048
I can't talk.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.550
Wait, wait, wait--
is she there?

17:31.617 --> 17:33.285
Yes, there's a whole situation
and it involves horses.

17:33.352 --> 17:34.453
Wait-- what?

17:34.520 --> 17:35.988
Oh, my God,
I should be at this party.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.389
Literally no one agrees
with that statement.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.791
<i>I have to go.</i>

17:38.857 --> 17:40.392
No, no, no, hang on, hang on,
hang on, it's important.

17:40.459 --> 17:41.593
What?

17:41.660 --> 17:42.961
How does she look?

17:43.028 --> 17:44.730
Like a mom.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.730
<i>Gross.</i>

17:44.797 --> 17:47.366
Where are you?

17:44.797 --> 17:47.366
In my bed.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.735
Oh, my God,
it's 12:30, Kyle.

17:49.802 --> 17:53.205
Yeah, on Saturday,
the day for beds.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.340
Oh, is that the new
slogan for Saturdays?

17:55.407 --> 17:56.875
Either way, it should be.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.875
<i>You know what,</i>

17:56.942 --> 17:58.110
I have to go, okay?

17:58.177 --> 17:59.378
I'm waiting for a call
from my doctor.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.780
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

18:01.847 --> 18:02.948
You're not concerned

18:03.015 --> 18:04.550
that a doctor's
calling me on a Saturday?

18:04.616 --> 18:06.718
She's probably just calling to
tell you you started menopause.

18:06.785 --> 18:07.853
What?

18:06.785 --> 18:07.853
<i>Yeah, what did they do,</i>

18:07.920 --> 18:09.021
<i>about your hormone tests?</i>

18:09.087 --> 18:10.389
Yeah.

18:10.456 --> 18:13.792
A hormone panel at your age
means menopause.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.294
<i>At a certain point</i>
<i>your uterus</i>

18:15.360 --> 18:18.030
will fall out of your vagina,
you'll get hot flashes.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.998
I've never had a hot flash!
What are you talking about?

18:20.065 --> 18:21.366
Your whole thing will dry up,

18:21.433 --> 18:23.802
you'll need to use those
special salves to get wet.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.838
I'm hanging up!

18:23.869 --> 18:25.838
Oh, I thought you already

18:25.904 --> 18:29.541
hung up, I was just--

18:25.904 --> 18:29.541
[phone dinging]

18:29.608 --> 18:31.977
[beep, phone rings]

18:32.044 --> 18:33.145
Dr. Katzberg's office.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.280
Hi, it's me again.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.317
I'm sorry?

18:38.383 --> 18:40.919
Uh, it's Andrea Warren,
calling for Dr. Katzberg again.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.187
We spoke earlier?

18:42.254 --> 18:44.022
Oh, right, you called
looking for OxyContin.

18:44.089 --> 18:47.960
I wasn't call-- calling about
OxyContin, but I, I...

18:48.026 --> 18:49.328
<i>Is Dr. Katzberg available?</i>

18:49.394 --> 18:51.797
<i>I just really want to</i>
<i>connect with her today.</i>

18:51.864 --> 18:52.798
Well, she just called you.

18:52.865 --> 18:53.866
What?

18:53.932 --> 18:54.900
<i>It went to voicemail.</i>

18:54.967 --> 18:56.034
I-- no.

18:56.101 --> 18:57.336
We do close at 1:00 today

18:57.402 --> 18:58.437
so you really should
stay by your phone.

18:58.504 --> 18:59.972
Wait, wait, wait--

19:00.038 --> 19:02.574
<i>I know that you said that</i>
<i>you can't divulge anything,</i>

19:02.641 --> 19:04.910
but is that because
that's just protocol

19:04.977 --> 19:06.845
or because there's
something to report?

19:06.912 --> 19:09.548
Again, I can't divulge
that kind of information.

19:09.615 --> 19:11.984
You know,
when you say "divulge"

19:12.050 --> 19:14.987
it makes it sound like
it's something bad.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.023
She'll call you back.

19:23.362 --> 19:24.463
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

19:24.530 --> 19:25.797
Is that the doctor?

19:25.864 --> 19:27.032
No, I'm still waiting
for her to call me.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.367
Oh.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.202
Brian, why are you
so involved in this?

19:30.269 --> 19:32.037
I like to be involved.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.706
I don't think it's a good sign
that she keeps calling you.

19:34.773 --> 19:37.042
Or it's just the true
definition of phone tag.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.143
I'm trying to help you.

19:38.210 --> 19:39.645
No, that--

19:38.210 --> 19:39.645
The whites of your eyes

19:39.711 --> 19:41.446
seem a little yellow,
which could be what,

19:41.513 --> 19:43.482
like, a kidney thing?

19:41.513 --> 19:43.482
Yeah, that's all kidney.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.050
But you know what,
your breath smells weird.

19:45.117 --> 19:46.585
Not bad, not bad...

19:45.117 --> 19:46.585
That could be an intestinal...

19:46.652 --> 19:48.854
...it just smells weird.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.854
...or a stomach.

19:48.921 --> 19:49.855
Oh, my God!

19:49.922 --> 19:52.558
Do you taste
what we smell?

19:52.624 --> 19:53.559
No.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.295
What's your bucket list?

19:56.361 --> 19:58.864
Your bucket list?

19:58.931 --> 20:01.700
Excuse me, I'm going
to the bathroom, okay?

20:01.767 --> 20:03.235
I think it's diabetes.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.281
[phone clatters on floor]

20:13.879 --> 20:16.281
Shit.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.150
[thud]

20:16.348 --> 20:18.150
Ow!

20:18.216 --> 20:19.484
Fuck!

20:19.551 --> 20:23.021
Ow-- ow, ow, ow--
Fuck me, motherless Cunt.

20:23.088 --> 20:25.724
Shit, that fucking hurts!

20:25.791 --> 20:26.758
Ah!

20:32.598 --> 20:34.967
Diane, I know that I said
that I don't talk like that--

20:35.033 --> 20:37.035
Hey, Andrea, if you
have a problem with me,

20:37.102 --> 20:38.770
you can say it to my face.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.339
What? No, I don't have
a problem with you.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.241
Really? You don't think
I've noticed you acting weirdly

20:43.308 --> 20:45.777
and staring at my butt
this entire party?

20:45.844 --> 20:47.112
Oh, and everybody's
been telling me

20:47.179 --> 20:50.048
about your obsession
with horses.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.950
Oh, no, no--
I didn't write that email.

20:52.017 --> 20:54.219
Nobody else liked
"War Horse"-- fact.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.021
I was actually
trying to find out

20:56.088 --> 20:59.291
who the horse person
was for you.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.159
Personally,
I don't even like horses.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.794
I don't care if they're
used for glue.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.162
Oh.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.162
Or maybe I do, I don't know,

21:04.229 --> 21:05.197
I just didn't
think that through.

21:05.263 --> 21:07.132
Oh, my God.
Is that my phone?

21:07.199 --> 21:08.400
Oh, yeah.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.400
Are you holding my--

21:08.467 --> 21:09.835
what are you doing
with my phone?

21:09.901 --> 21:11.203
You left it
in the bathroom.

21:11.269 --> 21:12.371
Did you follow me
to the bathroom

21:12.437 --> 21:13.705
and see if you could
grab it from me?

21:13.772 --> 21:15.941
No, I just--

21:13.772 --> 21:15.941
Did you want to look
at my pictures?

21:16.008 --> 21:18.810
I... looked at the screen saver
just to see whose phone it was.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.146
So you can scroll on
through, right?

21:18.877 --> 21:21.146
[phone ringing]

21:21.213 --> 21:23.649
And see if I had dirty
pictures on there.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.217
I--

21:23.715 --> 21:25.217
What are you doing?

21:25.283 --> 21:26.785
Are you kidding?
What-- what are you doing?

21:26.852 --> 21:28.387
Seriously?

21:26.852 --> 21:28.387
I just--

21:28.453 --> 21:30.689
It's my doctor and
she's been calling all day,

21:30.756 --> 21:33.191
and you know how hard it is
to get a doctor on the phone.

21:33.258 --> 21:34.359
Seriously, one second.

21:34.426 --> 21:35.894
Hi, Dr. Katzberg?

21:35.961 --> 21:37.596
Uh-huh, hi.

21:37.663 --> 21:41.833
Oh, I'm good, how are you?

21:41.900 --> 21:42.834
Actually,
you know what?

21:42.901 --> 21:43.902
I'm in the middle of
something here.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.704
Is everything okay?

21:47.873 --> 21:49.708
Thank you, I will
call you Monday.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.315
So...

21:57.382 --> 22:00.118
everything's good.

22:00.185 --> 22:02.054
Yay?

22:02.120 --> 22:03.989
I-- my cholesterol
got down to 80

22:04.056 --> 22:05.891
and we've been
working on that.

22:05.957 --> 22:10.228
She just wanted to
tell me personally.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.731
At least it wasn't menopause.

22:12.798 --> 22:13.932
I mean,
not that menopause

22:13.999 --> 22:15.867
isn't actually
a fully natural process...

22:15.934 --> 22:17.202
You are unbelievable.

22:17.269 --> 22:18.403
Of course you wrote
that email.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.138
I did not!

22:18.470 --> 22:20.138
You think you're better than me?

22:20.205 --> 22:21.173
No.

22:20.205 --> 22:21.173
You think you don't have

22:21.239 --> 22:23.041
any secrets?
Because I know that you,

22:23.108 --> 22:25.177
against school policy, used
artificial food coloring

22:25.243 --> 22:27.446
in Amelia's birthday cupcakes
even though you said

22:27.512 --> 22:28.980
they were from Whole Foods.

22:29.047 --> 22:32.818
First of all, I don't think
those are comparable secrets.

22:32.884 --> 22:35.387
But, I would like to say
that I don't agree

22:35.454 --> 22:37.055
with the school's
communist policy

22:37.122 --> 22:38.657
when it comes to
birthday treats.

22:38.724 --> 22:41.026
Sarah is not allergic
to artificial colors.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.894
Her mom just doesn't
want her to have them,

22:42.961 --> 22:47.566
and then the rest of us
have to suffer!

22:47.632 --> 22:51.269
There's no world where I think
that I am better than you.

22:51.336 --> 22:53.839
I look normal--
I'm disgusting.

22:53.905 --> 22:55.240
Mike, tell her.

22:53.905 --> 22:55.240
She's an animal.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.175
I just yelled cunt
in front of her granddaughter.

22:57.242 --> 23:00.045
Jeez, my God--

22:57.242 --> 23:00.045
Sorry, Diane.

23:00.112 --> 23:06.218
Melissa, I actually knew what
you used to... do before.

23:06.284 --> 23:08.019
And I did not tell anybody.

23:08.086 --> 23:09.187
Yeah, it was annoying.

23:11.423 --> 23:14.159
I am so sorry that
this is happening to you.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.495
It is not fair.

23:20.031 --> 23:22.801
Thank you, that makes
me feel a little...

23:22.868 --> 23:24.703
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.703
No, no, oh, my God.

23:24.770 --> 23:27.105
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have looked at your butt.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.273
That was on me.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.407
Your butt is your...

23:29.474 --> 23:30.742
Okay.

23:29.474 --> 23:30.742
...property,

23:30.809 --> 23:33.411
and I'm sure
it's doing great.

23:33.478 --> 23:35.614
[chuckling]

23:35.680 --> 23:37.215
It's just been
a really hard week.

23:37.282 --> 23:38.850
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.786
Yeah, a lot of shit's
been coming out.

23:40.852 --> 23:42.654
Mm-hmm.

23:42.721 --> 23:44.823
Mmm, yeah.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.558
We can't even imagine.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.558
No.

23:46.625 --> 23:49.427
Yeah.
Hi, by the way.

23:49.494 --> 23:51.530
Hi, Mike.

23:51.596 --> 23:52.964
We didn't get to say
hi earlier.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.070
would write these things.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.070
I know!

23:59.137 --> 24:02.941
It's just-- and to be anonymous,
it's just so... cowardly.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.442
Thank you guys.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.344
Come on, dear.

24:06.411 --> 24:08.713
Andrea did ask me
about a horse, though.

24:08.780 --> 24:09.981
Oh, my God.

24:10.048 --> 24:12.517
Some people can't
clean up their act.

24:14.319 --> 24:15.387
Oh, my God.

24:14.319 --> 24:15.387
No.

24:15.453 --> 24:17.856
But--

24:15.453 --> 24:17.856
No.

24:17.923 --> 24:20.258
[tight lipped]
Just shut your fucking mouth.

24:22.828 --> 24:25.564
So your vagina hole gets
bigger and bigger

24:25.630 --> 24:27.632
and bigger and bigger,

24:27.699 --> 24:31.102
and just snaps
back into place.

24:31.169 --> 24:32.470
Hey.

24:32.537 --> 24:35.106
Can I talk to you
for a second?

24:35.173 --> 24:36.641
Yeah.

24:36.708 --> 24:37.909
Yeah, you can.
