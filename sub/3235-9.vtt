<i>We're talking nearly a million
dollars of undocummented revenue.</i>

00:12.428 --> 00:13.725
Don't report this.

00:13.808 --> 00:15.459
I'll do it.
I'll kill him.

00:15.590 --> 00:18.001
Stick this on the car and
see where it goes.

00:18.335 --> 00:19.408
Do it.

00:23.129 --> 00:24.330
If something were to
happen to Hank then

00:24.507 --> 00:26.724
that would only draw
their attention to you.

00:26.815 --> 00:29.641
I will make sure that
he discovers nothing.

Just--

01:46.514 --> 01:48.748
You're like a bee
at a damn picnic, Marie.

01:48.782 --> 01:50.683
Bzzz.
Good morning.

01:50.717 --> 01:52.417
Hey, buddy.

01:52.452 --> 01:54.219
Ready to get your rocks on?

01:54.253 --> 01:55.420
See? I knew it.

01:55.455 --> 01:57.690
"Mineral show" is just
some sort of guy code

01:57.724 --> 01:59.158
for strip club.

01:59.192 --> 02:00.827
Hey, you got any singles?

02:02.429 --> 02:03.596
- Got it?
- Yeah.

02:03.630 --> 02:04.964
Yeah.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.935
Don't let him
get too crazy, okay?

02:09.970 --> 02:12.204
Cram one more giant geode
in here,

02:12.238 --> 02:13.772
we'll be sleeping
in the garage.

02:13.807 --> 02:14.773
Got it.
I got it.

02:14.808 --> 02:15.807
I'm sorry.

02:22.781 --> 02:23.748
Christ.

02:23.782 --> 02:25.382
Longest week ever.

02:26.818 --> 02:29.153
I just hope we get
something good, you know?

02:29.187 --> 02:31.054
Keep your fingers crossed.

02:35.127 --> 02:38.162
Relax, buddy.
This ain't no spy movie.

02:40.165 --> 02:42.100
It's more like <i>Rocky,</i> you know?

What are you doing, buddy?

03:51.035 --> 03:52.035
Leaving.

03:52.070 --> 03:53.303
No, you got to go inside

03:53.338 --> 03:54.571
and order something
like last time

03:54.606 --> 03:55.739
to avoid suspicion.

03:55.773 --> 03:58.542
Besides,
I want a vanilla shake.

03:58.576 --> 04:01.078
We'll use the drive-through.

04:08.454 --> 04:10.889
All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.

04:29.743 --> 04:30.709
What the hell?

04:30.743 --> 04:34.546
Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.

04:34.580 --> 04:38.316
That's work, that's home,
that's work, that's home.

04:38.350 --> 04:42.720
What, this guy goes
two places every day all week?

04:42.754 --> 04:45.422
It's unbelievable.

04:45.456 --> 04:47.957
Chicken-slinging
son of a bitch.

04:49.927 --> 04:52.695
Hank, is it possible that...

04:52.729 --> 04:55.631
maybe, just maybe...

04:55.665 --> 04:57.700
he's not your guy?

04:57.734 --> 05:00.569
Oh, a guy this clean's
got to be dirty.

05:03.307 --> 05:05.541
What's the play here, buddy?

05:05.575 --> 05:07.477
How do I get this guy?

05:08.879 --> 05:10.347
Yeah.

05:10.381 --> 05:11.815
How?

06:12.744 --> 06:14.145
Yes, hi.

06:14.179 --> 06:17.481
I live on the 4900 block
of Doswell Place,

06:17.516 --> 06:20.584
and I want to report
a very suspicious man

06:20.619 --> 06:22.553
who's lurking
in my neighborhood.

06:22.587 --> 06:24.121
He's sitting in a blue Sedan,

06:24.156 --> 06:26.624
and he-- He's been staring
at a particular house

06:26.658 --> 06:27.991
for a very long time.

06:28.026 --> 06:30.761
Thank you. Thank you so much.

06:30.796 --> 06:33.464
If you would,
I would appreciate it.

07:06.830 --> 07:07.997
All right.

07:08.031 --> 07:10.132
So I guess we better
get started.

07:11.201 --> 07:12.401
I already did.

07:15.405 --> 07:16.406
Yeah?

07:21.780 --> 07:22.880
Hey, uh...

07:26.885 --> 07:28.520
You got one of those for me?

07:28.554 --> 07:29.921
One of those what?

07:29.955 --> 07:30.955
Cigarette.

07:34.793 --> 07:36.661
Like, it's still in there,
all right?

07:36.695 --> 07:38.529
I didn't get a chance yet.

07:42.134 --> 07:44.435
Just give me one.

08:04.088 --> 08:05.121
Hmm.

08:09.827 --> 08:12.129
So what have you been up to?

08:12.163 --> 08:13.697
What?

08:13.731 --> 08:16.799
You know, just
a day in the life.

08:16.834 --> 08:18.534
What do you do after work?

08:21.438 --> 08:23.773
Go home, watch TV.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.308
What do you watch?

08:25.342 --> 08:27.177
I don't know. Stuff.

08:27.212 --> 08:28.712
Like what?

08:31.917 --> 08:34.251
Like, uh...

08:34.285 --> 08:36.020
<i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

08:36.054 --> 08:38.655
<i>Ice Road Truckers.</i>

08:38.691 --> 08:40.357
What happens on that one?

08:40.393 --> 08:43.695
Guys drive on ice.

08:49.069 --> 08:51.003
I am going to do it.

08:58.310 --> 09:00.411
You got to inhale, by the way.

09:03.614 --> 09:06.716
What the hell, man, don't you
have enough cancer already?

09:06.750 --> 09:12.154
Look, I said...I'd do it.

09:12.188 --> 09:13.823
I'll do it.

09:14.925 --> 09:19.595
Yeah, well,
what does it matter?

09:19.629 --> 09:21.864
We're both dead men anyway.

09:56.902 --> 09:57.935
<i>Hi.</i>

09:57.970 --> 09:59.203
Hi.

09:59.238 --> 10:01.939
Am I, uh, catching you
at a bad time?

10:01.973 --> 10:04.508
No, I have a few minutes.

10:04.542 --> 10:07.510
So Mr. I'm Almost 16
So Leave Me Alone

10:07.545 --> 10:09.179
doesn't want a big thing
for his birthday.

10:09.213 --> 10:11.048
He just wants to hang out
with his friends,

10:11.083 --> 10:12.550
which is fine by me. You?

10:12.584 --> 10:13.918
Fine by me.

10:13.953 --> 10:16.855
<i>Okay. So I figured, uh,</i>

10:16.889 --> 10:19.124
<i>low-key family dinner,</i>
<i>no official party,</i>

10:19.159 --> 10:22.028
<i>and we bite the bullet</i> <i>and...</i>

10:23.464 --> 10:24.797
buy him a car--

10:24.832 --> 10:28.268
Uh, used, I was thinking,
would be best.

10:28.303 --> 10:30.137
But no more
than five years old.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.440
Air bags, safety rated,
all that.

10:33.475 --> 10:35.676
Do you, um, have any thoughts

10:35.710 --> 10:37.144
on what kind,

10:37.179 --> 10:40.047
or should I
just go ahead and--

10:40.081 --> 10:42.983
Yeah. No, you just go ahead.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.151
<i>Okay.</i>

10:46.055 --> 10:48.589
<i>Listen. On another subject,</i>

10:48.624 --> 10:50.992
<i>I just wanted to tell you</i> <i>that</i>

10:51.026 --> 10:53.327
business is good.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.696
Really good.

10:55.730 --> 10:59.900
So good that I'm thinking
maybe...

10:59.934 --> 11:04.204
you don't even need
to work your second job.

11:10.612 --> 11:12.246
You're turning a profit?

11:12.280 --> 11:13.781
<i>We're coming close.</i>

11:13.815 --> 11:15.083
Give us another month or two,

11:15.117 --> 11:19.754
and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.

11:19.788 --> 11:22.490
All of this to say

11:22.524 --> 11:26.326
maybe you could start thinking
about an exit strategy.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.399
I'm working on it.

11:34.136 --> 11:35.370
Okay.

12:04.820 --> 12:05.920
Hello.

12:05.955 --> 12:07.622
<i>Hey, buddy. Wake you?</i>

12:10.392 --> 12:12.060
No, Hank, I'm up.

12:12.094 --> 12:15.096
Oh, good. Uh, what you doing?

12:15.130 --> 12:16.931
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

12:16.965 --> 12:18.399
Hey, listen,
I-I'll cut to it.

12:18.434 --> 12:19.834
I got another favor to ask.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.335
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>about this Gus Fring, right?</i>

12:21.370 --> 12:23.104
<i>How he never goes anywhere,</i>

12:23.138 --> 12:24.672
<i>one restaurant, home,</i>
<i>one restaurant, home,</i>

12:24.707 --> 12:25.907
<i>back and forth</i> <i>back and forth?</i>

12:25.941 --> 12:27.108
<i>Which, now I'm even</i>
<i>more convinced</i>

12:27.142 --> 12:28.710
<i>is bullshit, because</i>
<i>the man owns</i>

12:28.744 --> 12:30.745
<i>13 other restaurants, right?</i>

12:30.780 --> 12:33.781
So I started thinking about this
little empire of his, right?

12:33.816 --> 12:35.416
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?

12:35.451 --> 12:37.885
What's the base of operations?

12:37.920 --> 12:40.288
So I do a little diggin',
and bingo!

12:40.322 --> 12:43.157
Pollos Hermanos has
a main distribution center.

12:43.192 --> 12:44.692
<i>Uh... It's not far from town.</i>

12:44.727 --> 12:47.228
The place is huge.
I mean--

12:47.262 --> 12:48.896
I'm looking at it
online right now.

12:48.931 --> 12:50.865
I tell you, it's
a big warehouse

12:50.900 --> 12:54.435
and rows of these
long poultry buildings,

12:54.469 --> 12:56.471
or hatcheries, or
whatever you call 'em.

12:56.505 --> 12:59.307
<i>Lots of space to hide</i>
<i>illicit activity.</i>

12:59.341 --> 13:02.143
<i>Sounds promising, right?</i>

13:02.177 --> 13:03.511
Huh.

13:03.545 --> 13:05.513
<i>So. Whaddya say, buddy?</i>

13:05.548 --> 13:08.683
<i>Got another</i> <i>field trip in you?</i>

13:08.717 --> 13:09.750
Uhh...

13:11.086 --> 13:13.921
You know, Hank. Um...

13:13.955 --> 13:15.622
I mean, it sounds great.

13:15.656 --> 13:18.190
It really does. But I--

13:18.225 --> 13:20.893
You know, I won't lie, uh--

13:20.927 --> 13:25.497
You caught me...
somewhat...

13:25.531 --> 13:27.832
indisposed.

13:27.867 --> 13:29.901
What do you mean, like
taking a dump indisposed?

13:31.570 --> 13:34.005
Yeah. That's--

13:34.040 --> 13:36.541
Embarrassingly, that's it.

13:36.576 --> 13:39.911
You know, it's just...

13:39.946 --> 13:41.479
upset stomach, you know,
and everything...

13:41.514 --> 13:44.650
- Yeah.
<i>- It's out of control.</i>

13:44.684 --> 13:46.952
Really explosive.

13:46.986 --> 13:49.020
Bad Tex-Mex.

13:49.054 --> 13:50.956
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:50.990 --> 13:53.992
I get it. You don't have
to paint me a picture.

13:54.026 --> 13:55.961
Probably one guy in a diaper
is enough for this trip anyway.

13:55.995 --> 13:57.796
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry, Hank.</i>

13:57.830 --> 13:59.331
Hey, don't be.

13:59.365 --> 14:00.799
I've been asking a lot
of you lately.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.368
I appreciate it.

14:02.402 --> 14:05.504
I'll find another
ride for this one.

14:05.538 --> 14:09.374
Another ride?

14:09.409 --> 14:11.543
Yeah. I'm sure I can get
someone else to take me.

14:11.577 --> 14:13.377
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.

14:13.412 --> 14:14.912
Maybe I'll ask him.

14:14.946 --> 14:16.514
<i>Look, I'm-- I'm--</i>

14:16.548 --> 14:19.049
<i>This is probably</i>
<i>just a 24-hour thing.</i>

14:19.083 --> 14:21.351
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.

14:21.385 --> 14:22.986
And, um...

14:23.020 --> 14:25.488
Do you think you could
possibly hold off

14:25.522 --> 14:27.289
for a day or two?

14:27.324 --> 14:31.161
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-- You know--

14:31.195 --> 14:32.729
<i>You know, I just--</i>

14:32.763 --> 14:34.164
<i>I would just really...</i>

14:34.199 --> 14:36.801
love to be the one
to be able to--

14:36.835 --> 14:38.703
to take you there, and--

14:38.737 --> 14:43.408
I mean, I have just
really enjoyed, you know,

14:43.443 --> 14:45.411
the time with you,

14:45.445 --> 14:48.648
- and helping you.
<i>- Well, yeah.</i>

14:48.682 --> 14:51.150
Okay, sure. If it means
that much to you.

14:52.353 --> 14:53.986
Just, you know, give me a call

14:54.021 --> 14:55.654
when you're feeling
up to it, all right?

14:55.689 --> 14:59.357
Thank you.
I will. Okay.

14:59.392 --> 15:00.892
Bye.

15:21.649 --> 15:24.284
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Uh, Mike.

15:24.318 --> 15:27.221
Listen. I just want to say,
first off,

15:27.255 --> 15:28.989
don't be angry.

15:29.023 --> 15:30.123
<i>What is it, Walter?</i>

15:30.158 --> 15:31.592
My brother-in-law,

15:31.626 --> 15:34.828
My DEA-- He--

15:34.862 --> 15:37.297
Soon, he will probably,

15:37.332 --> 15:40.167
in the near future,
take a ride out to

15:40.201 --> 15:42.068
a certain distribution center,

15:42.102 --> 15:45.538
to look around for things.

15:49.510 --> 15:53.946
Look around for things.
And... Yeah.

15:53.981 --> 15:57.316
Uh.

15:58.886 --> 16:00.053
Mike?

16:18.473 --> 16:21.308
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.

16:30.652 --> 16:32.419
You're all set.

16:32.453 --> 16:35.422
Thank you. Please give this
to your car care professional.

16:46.802 --> 16:49.503
So. A hand wax
for you today?

16:49.537 --> 16:52.372
Okay. Great.

16:56.477 --> 16:58.812
Please give this to your
car care professional.

16:58.846 --> 17:00.279
And the black Explorer?

17:00.313 --> 17:02.615
Well, of course we could shampoo
your floor mats, but really,

17:02.649 --> 17:04.883
deluxe detailing is
the best bang for your buck.

17:04.917 --> 17:07.319
Oh, and SUVs are extra.

17:08.689 --> 17:11.391
And please give this to
your car care professional.

17:11.425 --> 17:12.724
Thank you!

17:12.760 --> 17:15.795
Please give this to
your car care professional.

17:21.203 --> 17:22.236
Hey, Sky.

17:23.739 --> 17:25.506
Oh, my God.
Ted.

17:25.540 --> 17:27.108
What are you, uh--

17:27.142 --> 17:28.910
Someone from the office, uh,

17:28.944 --> 17:31.279
said you worked down here,
so I thought I'd...

17:31.313 --> 17:32.880
come down and say hi.

17:32.914 --> 17:34.181
Wow. Well, uh...

17:34.215 --> 17:37.083
Hello.

17:37.117 --> 17:38.484
You look great.

17:38.519 --> 17:40.887
No. I'm gonna like--

17:40.921 --> 17:42.421
I probably just look crazed.

17:42.456 --> 17:45.190
Not at all.
You look happy.

17:45.224 --> 17:46.959
Last time I saw you--

17:52.498 --> 17:54.332
Hi, there.

17:54.367 --> 17:55.834
Uh, thing is,

17:55.868 --> 17:57.869
Skyler, um,

17:57.903 --> 17:59.904
I really need to talk to you.

18:02.441 --> 18:05.009
Ted,

18:05.044 --> 18:08.113
I really don't think we have
anything to talk about.

18:09.582 --> 18:12.017
Actually, we do.

18:12.051 --> 18:13.952
An audit?

18:13.986 --> 18:18.624
Wait, an audit tomorrow?

18:18.658 --> 18:20.860
How long have you had this?

18:20.894 --> 18:23.462
Awhile. I'd...

18:23.497 --> 18:25.598
debated, you know,
contacting you.

18:25.632 --> 18:27.900
Contact me? What about
a lawyer? Ted--

18:27.934 --> 18:30.603
Ted, this is--

18:30.637 --> 18:32.105
This is the CID.

18:32.139 --> 18:35.407
The Criminal Division.

18:35.442 --> 18:39.378
My God, you facing
a felony charge here.

18:39.413 --> 18:42.115
$100,000 fine
on top of the taxes

18:42.149 --> 18:43.783
you already owe, plus

18:43.817 --> 18:45.452
five years in prison!

18:45.486 --> 18:47.420
Yeah. It's bad.

18:47.455 --> 18:50.390
Yeah.
It most certainly is.

18:51.926 --> 18:53.260
Look, here's the thing.

18:53.295 --> 18:56.998
I was wondering, maybe, if um,

18:57.032 --> 18:58.666
there's some way
you could help with this.

18:58.701 --> 19:02.938
Help? Help how?

19:02.973 --> 19:06.276
Well, with your knowledge
of how the books

19:06.310 --> 19:08.445
got the way they are,
maybe there's some way

19:08.479 --> 19:10.380
you could, uh,

19:10.414 --> 19:12.815
undo what's in there.

19:12.850 --> 19:16.119
You want me to
uncook your books?

19:16.153 --> 19:18.954
Maybe there's some method,
or some accounting trick

19:18.989 --> 19:21.657
- you could, you know, use--
- Ted.

19:21.692 --> 19:23.626
It doesn't work like that.

19:23.660 --> 19:26.095
The damage is already--

19:29.933 --> 19:34.503
My name. My signatures

19:34.537 --> 19:37.705
are all over those books.

19:37.740 --> 19:40.141
Skyler, I'm accountable,
not you.

19:40.175 --> 19:42.910
Let me explain what's
gonna happen here, okay?

19:42.944 --> 19:46.480
Once the CID sees this
as willful tax fraud,

19:46.515 --> 19:48.582
there are going to build
the strongest possible case

19:48.616 --> 19:51.151
against you, and once
they start down that path,

19:51.186 --> 19:53.887
they have an 80%
conviction rate.

19:53.922 --> 19:57.257
That's because they're allowed
to monitor your mail,

19:57.292 --> 20:01.528
and tap your phones--
and not just you, Ted.

20:01.563 --> 20:04.698
Everyone involved
in those books.

20:06.769 --> 20:10.704
I can't have this in my life.

20:10.738 --> 20:13.340
I cannot be audited.

20:13.374 --> 20:14.641
Skyler, you-- you--

20:14.676 --> 20:17.276
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.

20:17.311 --> 20:20.546
It's the captain they want,
not some cashier at a car wash.

20:23.883 --> 20:26.151
No offense. I'm sorry.

20:26.185 --> 20:29.554
I, uh,

20:29.588 --> 20:31.857
I don't want you
to worry, okay?

20:32.993 --> 20:35.561
I'm gonna figure out
a way through this.

20:35.596 --> 20:37.530
Somehow. Okay?

20:47.776 --> 20:49.577
Here.

20:49.612 --> 20:51.178
Right here.

21:07.929 --> 21:09.229
So is he gonna kill him?

21:13.468 --> 21:14.868
Is who gonna kill who?

21:17.372 --> 21:19.206
Gus.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.775
Is he gonna kill
Mr. White's brother-in-law?

21:25.280 --> 21:28.316
I mean, he's the reason
for all this here, right?

21:31.052 --> 21:35.923
Because it's totally logical
for him to off the dude.

21:38.794 --> 21:41.028
A-hole DEA agent,

21:41.063 --> 21:42.997
pokin' around your junk--

21:44.700 --> 21:46.901
Who needs that, right?

21:49.171 --> 21:52.006
Makes sense
to get rid of him...

21:52.041 --> 21:54.676
for good.

21:58.948 --> 22:02.551
But killing a cop--

22:02.585 --> 22:05.920
I don't know.

22:05.955 --> 22:08.490
It could look suspicious
if, uh,

22:08.524 --> 22:10.859
the dude who's
investigating you

22:10.893 --> 22:12.928
suddenly up and dies.

22:18.201 --> 22:20.870
Then there's--
There's Mr. White.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.308
Who'd be even more ape shit

22:25.343 --> 22:30.246
if he had family
getting murdered.

22:33.817 --> 22:36.185
He'd never cook for Gus again.

22:42.091 --> 22:46.460
Guess there's a lot
of angles to consider.

22:51.165 --> 22:52.532
If something were
to happen to the man,

22:52.567 --> 22:54.601
would you have
a problem with that?

23:00.441 --> 23:02.442
Who really cares what I think?

23:56.531 --> 23:59.833
Son of a bitch!

24:01.569 --> 24:04.403
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.

24:18.354 --> 24:20.855
- Hey.
- Get down!

25:19.334 --> 25:20.668
<i>Sí.</i>

26:05.501 --> 26:08.186
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.

26:14.589 --> 26:19.293
So what? Is this going
to be a regular thing now?

26:19.328 --> 26:21.796
Meth cooking
and corpse disposal? Jesus.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.633
Just grab us
a spare barrel, Walter.

26:27.137 --> 26:28.336
What was it this time?

26:28.371 --> 26:31.740
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gus?

26:31.774 --> 26:33.809
Or did Gus just need
to send another message?

26:33.843 --> 26:36.178
Shut your mouth.

26:36.212 --> 26:38.880
You shut your mouth,
or I'll shut it for you.

26:38.914 --> 26:40.782
I don't want you talking
to me or Jesse.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.717
Just get the barrel.

26:44.119 --> 26:46.287
And if you ever plan
on calling the cops

26:46.321 --> 26:49.523
on one of my guys again,

26:49.558 --> 26:52.192
you go ahead
and get two barrels.

27:29.631 --> 27:32.333
Yo, like, uh,

27:32.367 --> 27:35.770
I guess I never thanked you for

27:35.804 --> 27:37.338
what you did.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.609
Thanks.

27:44.013 --> 27:46.281
Next time, don't stand there
like an idiot.

27:46.316 --> 27:49.385
Move your feet,
run and so forth.

27:50.387 --> 27:52.655
But seriously,
what--

27:52.689 --> 27:54.022
What was the deal with Gus?

27:54.057 --> 27:57.459
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?

27:57.493 --> 27:59.460
Walking right into the bullets?

27:59.494 --> 28:02.329
What the hell was he doing?

28:02.364 --> 28:04.898
The cartel needs Gus.

28:04.932 --> 28:06.466
His distribution network.

28:06.501 --> 28:08.168
They're not looking
to kill him.

28:08.202 --> 28:11.771
But what? The rest of us
are like, open season?

28:11.806 --> 28:13.339
Is he doing anything
about that?

28:13.374 --> 28:14.641
Or do we just keep hanging out

28:14.675 --> 28:15.975
for target practice
while he's--

28:16.009 --> 28:17.710
Kid.

28:17.745 --> 28:21.281
Enough. You got questions,

28:21.315 --> 28:22.582
ask him yourself.

28:34.030 --> 28:39.401
And here again.
Unreported income.

28:39.436 --> 28:43.273
That's more than
a year straight so far.

28:43.307 --> 28:44.808
Do you want to say
something about this?

28:44.842 --> 28:47.778
Because I'm having
a hard time figuring it out.

28:47.812 --> 28:51.849
Well, I-- I'd have to, um,

28:51.883 --> 28:53.951
have a look at the copies
of the receipts

28:53.985 --> 28:55.552
to refresh my memory.

28:55.586 --> 28:57.420
Take all the time
you need, Mr. Beneke.

28:57.454 --> 28:59.522
That's why we're here.

29:03.193 --> 29:07.162
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.

29:07.196 --> 29:08.696
I got lost.

29:08.731 --> 29:10.865
- Hey, Ted.
- Sky.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.000
Whoo!

29:12.034 --> 29:14.369
This building is so confusing.

29:14.403 --> 29:15.770
There are doors everywhere.

29:15.805 --> 29:17.506
Hi. You are--

29:17.540 --> 29:19.340
Special Agent James Bekaris.

29:19.375 --> 29:21.143
Ooh. Special.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.345
Skyler White.

29:23.379 --> 29:26.215
Ms. White. You are
the accountant

29:26.249 --> 29:27.917
of record for many
of these reports.

29:27.951 --> 29:29.519
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.

29:29.553 --> 29:31.487
Well then, perhaps you can
shed some light

29:31.522 --> 29:33.356
on this history
of missing revenue.

29:33.391 --> 29:35.125
Missing?
Uh-huh.

29:35.160 --> 29:37.161
- No, it's there.
- No.

29:37.195 --> 29:39.764
Revenue most definitely
flowed through this company.

29:39.798 --> 29:42.000
But it's not all accounted for
in your reports.

29:42.034 --> 29:44.570
Huh!

29:47.507 --> 29:50.243
Hmm, let's take a look.

29:50.277 --> 29:51.877
Hmm. Oh.

29:51.912 --> 29:54.579
Well, you know,
this account here?

29:54.614 --> 29:56.648
That is Mr. Keller's account,

29:56.682 --> 29:59.484
and Mr. Keller's
an old friend of Ted's dad,

29:59.518 --> 30:02.086
and he always sends
an electronic payment,

30:02.121 --> 30:03.221
which personally I hate,

30:03.255 --> 30:04.923
because
I'm a real paper person,

30:04.957 --> 30:07.725
but Mr. Keller's one
of those environmental people.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.060
So anyway, since there
wasn't a physical check,

30:10.095 --> 30:12.830
I didn't enter it
into the book, but...

30:12.865 --> 30:14.965
the money's there.

30:16.368 --> 30:19.404
Ms. White, you've read
Section 61 of the IRC?

30:19.438 --> 30:22.573
I... did not follow
what you just said.

30:22.608 --> 30:26.678
How gross income for a
business is defined.

30:26.712 --> 30:28.714
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.

30:28.748 --> 30:30.315
No, you're not.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.418
Well, you know what they say
about opinions, right?

30:32.452 --> 30:35.387
Everyone's got one.

30:36.423 --> 30:38.057
But seriously, I am.

30:38.091 --> 30:39.959
Look, it doesn't matter
if its an electronic check

30:39.993 --> 30:42.328
or a paper check,
income is income.

30:42.363 --> 30:44.464
You're not allowed
to not declare it.

30:44.498 --> 30:47.868
When I input everything
into the Quicken,

30:47.902 --> 30:50.337
nothing flashed red,
so that's gotta mean

30:50.371 --> 30:53.306
it's okay, right?

30:53.340 --> 30:55.408
Quicken.
Uh-huh.

30:55.442 --> 30:58.143
You used Quicken
to manage books

30:58.178 --> 30:59.811
for a business this size.

30:59.846 --> 31:01.813
I did. Oh, do you guys
use that here?

31:01.848 --> 31:03.414
'Cause it is the best.

31:03.449 --> 31:06.651
It's like having a calculator
on your computer. Amazing.

31:06.685 --> 31:08.619
Ms. White, how did you
get this job?

31:08.653 --> 31:10.488
- Oh, Ted hired me.
- No.

31:10.523 --> 31:13.024
I mean your qualifications.

31:13.059 --> 31:14.259
What are your qualifications?

31:14.294 --> 31:15.894
Where did you
get your training?

31:15.929 --> 31:19.265
Ooh, well I haven't had
any training per se,

31:19.299 --> 31:21.834
I've always been naturally
good with numbers.

31:21.869 --> 31:23.736
Got a good instinct for them.

31:23.771 --> 31:25.572
Right, Teddy?

31:29.310 --> 31:30.978
Right.

31:31.012 --> 31:34.848
This is all falling
into place now.

31:38.519 --> 31:40.320
Ms. White,
I just have to ask.

31:41.855 --> 31:44.590
You're not managing accounts
anywhere else, are you?

31:44.625 --> 31:46.659
Right now? No.

31:46.693 --> 31:48.727
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

31:50.230 --> 31:54.734
I'm not really clear about
what happened in there.

31:54.769 --> 31:57.171
What happened is good news.

31:57.205 --> 31:59.574
Ignorance of the law does
not equate to criminality.

31:59.608 --> 32:01.543
It equates to ignorance.

32:01.577 --> 32:04.646
Look, pay your back taxes,
pay the penalties,

32:04.680 --> 32:06.915
and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.

32:06.949 --> 32:09.151
Pay with what?

32:09.185 --> 32:11.286
I owe them $617,000.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.054
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.

32:13.089 --> 32:16.291
All right? You just
dodged prison.

32:16.325 --> 32:18.959
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW,

32:18.994 --> 32:20.461
take out a second
mortgage on your house.

32:20.495 --> 32:22.329
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.

32:22.363 --> 32:24.597
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets

32:24.631 --> 32:26.632
- left to sell.
- Ted.

32:26.667 --> 32:29.868
If you don't pay them, they
will reopen the investigation.

32:29.903 --> 32:32.605
And that little fiction
I just spun up there

32:32.639 --> 32:34.707
will completely unravel.

32:34.741 --> 32:36.842
You have to settle.

32:39.213 --> 32:41.213
Wish I could.

33:28.661 --> 33:30.863
Come in.

33:45.612 --> 33:48.014
I hope you brought an appetite.

33:50.417 --> 33:52.218
Yeah. I guess.

33:55.556 --> 33:58.825
Mike mentioned
you have some questions.

34:01.963 --> 34:05.465
Yeah.

34:05.499 --> 34:09.136
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.

34:15.409 --> 34:17.677
Right on.

34:29.389 --> 34:31.391
What am I doing here?

34:42.436 --> 34:44.803
I know you have concerns.

34:44.838 --> 34:47.706
What happened yesterday

34:47.739 --> 34:49.440
to my man at the farm--

34:49.475 --> 34:51.110
It was a terrible thing.

34:51.143 --> 34:55.148
Oh, the dude getting
his head blown off? Yeah.

34:55.181 --> 34:58.853
I have invited you
into my home,

34:58.887 --> 35:00.988
prepared food,

35:01.023 --> 35:03.725
so we could sit and talk.

35:06.463 --> 35:09.698
Discuss what's going on
in this business,

35:09.733 --> 35:12.768
our business, like men.

35:12.802 --> 35:16.504
And I will explain
everything that's happening.

35:16.539 --> 35:18.673
I will answer your questions.

35:18.708 --> 35:23.344
But first, I need you...

35:23.378 --> 35:26.580
to answer one question for me.

35:28.349 --> 35:30.517
Can you cook Walter's formula?

35:32.887 --> 35:35.055
What?

35:35.090 --> 35:36.824
Walter's formula.

35:36.858 --> 35:39.393
Can you produce this product?

35:39.427 --> 35:42.864
Without any help, alone?

35:42.898 --> 35:45.099
No.

35:47.337 --> 35:48.870
Why?

35:48.905 --> 35:53.442
You asking me if I can
cook Mr. White's crystal?

35:53.476 --> 35:58.314
Without him? Me?

35:58.348 --> 36:00.316
The junkie loser
you were about to waste

36:00.350 --> 36:02.751
and dump in the desert
a month ago?

36:02.786 --> 36:05.621
This is your plan, huh?

36:05.655 --> 36:11.027
Invite me in your house,
make whatever this is,

36:11.061 --> 36:15.665
be my buddy and--
And make me feel

36:15.699 --> 36:17.767
important,

36:17.801 --> 36:21.704
then get me to keep
cooking for you

36:21.738 --> 36:24.207
after you kill Mr. White.

36:26.043 --> 36:29.079
You want to-- You want
to talk like men?

36:29.113 --> 36:30.480
Let's talk like men!

36:30.515 --> 36:34.718
You kill Mr. White, you're
gonna have to kill me too.

36:34.752 --> 36:37.954
That is not what I asked you.

36:37.988 --> 36:40.457
You are here

36:40.491 --> 36:43.393
because circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

36:43.427 --> 36:45.662
And I need your help.

36:47.665 --> 36:49.632
I need you to help prevent
an all-out war.

36:50.767 --> 36:54.504
Now, if you would,

36:54.538 --> 36:56.906
answer the question.

37:57.284 --> 38:00.318
Hey, you, uh--
You headed out?

38:02.655 --> 38:04.824
Yeah.

38:48.968 --> 38:51.236
<i>Yo, Mr. White. Hey, uh,</i>

38:51.270 --> 38:53.038
<i>I really got to talk to you.</i>
<i>I-- I don't know</i>

38:53.072 --> 38:54.839
<i>if you're with</i>
<i>your family or whatever,</i>

38:54.873 --> 38:59.010
<i>but this is important,</i>
<i>so I'm hoping</i>

38:59.044 --> 39:01.880
<i>you could come over.</i>

39:09.021 --> 39:11.423
Thank God. Come on in.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.595
You uh--
You want a beer?

39:16.629 --> 39:18.797
- Or something?
- No.

39:18.831 --> 39:20.666
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

39:20.700 --> 39:23.502
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.

39:23.536 --> 39:26.038
Okay, so, um--

39:26.072 --> 39:27.706
Okay. So...

39:27.740 --> 39:30.209
word has come
down that they--

39:30.243 --> 39:34.246
They want me to go to Mexico.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.516
There's some sort
of war brewing

39:37.550 --> 39:40.085
between Gus and the cartel.

39:40.120 --> 39:41.554
"Word has come down?"

39:41.588 --> 39:45.558
Yeah, the cartel has been
messing with Gus's operation.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.626
Like jacking trucks
to like, send a message,

39:47.660 --> 39:50.029
and you know, yesterday,
that dude

39:50.063 --> 39:51.430
we brought to the lab?

39:51.465 --> 39:54.033
I mean, they shot him
right in front of me.

39:54.067 --> 39:56.402
Just blew his head open.

39:56.437 --> 39:59.072
Some sniper nailed him
from like a mile away.

40:01.408 --> 40:04.143
Anyway, they've been
holding them off,

40:04.177 --> 40:07.546
but between the cartel
taking pot shots

40:07.581 --> 40:09.815
and your brother-in-law
trying to throw a net

40:09.849 --> 40:12.350
over the whole deal, it's
like, what do you call,

40:12.385 --> 40:15.086
a rock and a hard place
situation.

40:15.120 --> 40:19.524
So Gus is gonna cave.

40:19.558 --> 40:21.960
So the cartel wants half

40:21.994 --> 40:24.529
of Gus' entire operation,
and they want

40:24.563 --> 40:27.432
your formula, and he's
gonna give it to them.

40:27.466 --> 40:29.767
Well, I-- I gotta
give it to them.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.969
I mean, I'm supposed
to go to Mexico

40:32.004 --> 40:34.806
and teach a bunch of
cartel chemists

40:34.840 --> 40:36.841
how to cook a batch of blue.

40:38.343 --> 40:40.478
You know, Gus doesn't
trust you, so...

40:40.512 --> 40:43.748
I gotta go-- I mean,
you're the chemist, man!

40:43.782 --> 40:45.349
You know, not me.

40:45.383 --> 40:46.817
Let's say I go down

40:46.851 --> 40:50.019
to, you know, go over there,
go to the jungle

40:50.054 --> 40:51.654
or-- Or whatever.

40:51.689 --> 40:54.090
You know, and say they got,
like, actual chemists,

40:54.124 --> 40:57.860
like cartel chemists,
asking me chemistry stuff

40:57.894 --> 41:00.529
that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you?

41:00.564 --> 41:02.265
And what if, like,
all the equipment

41:02.299 --> 41:05.969
is uh, is in Mexican,
instead of English?

41:06.004 --> 41:08.305
You know? Oh!

41:08.339 --> 41:10.241
I don't know.
I don't know.

41:10.275 --> 41:13.378
I mean, if I mess this up,

41:13.412 --> 41:15.513
I am dead, you know?

41:15.548 --> 41:17.649
All of us!

41:20.086 --> 41:24.022
So I-- Look, I--
I need your help.

41:24.056 --> 41:26.090
Okay, maybe you could--

41:26.125 --> 41:28.526
Maybe you could, like, coach me

41:28.560 --> 41:30.694
or something, you know?

41:30.729 --> 41:33.063
Or you can give me some notes.

41:33.097 --> 41:36.366
Mr. White.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.201
So you saw Gus?

41:39.803 --> 41:41.738
What? No.

41:41.772 --> 41:45.042
You didn't see Gus.
No.

41:45.076 --> 41:48.413
Then who told you all of that?

41:48.447 --> 41:51.449
It was passed down,
like I said.

41:51.484 --> 41:54.786
Passed down?

41:54.820 --> 41:56.455
By whom?

41:56.489 --> 41:58.824
By, uh...
By Mike and them.

41:58.858 --> 42:00.025
They did. They--

42:00.059 --> 42:02.827
So "they" doesn't include Gus.

42:02.861 --> 42:04.862
You haven't been with Gus.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.698
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.

42:07.733 --> 42:08.833
Why are you...

42:08.867 --> 42:11.268
You weren't at Gus's house
last night.

42:11.303 --> 42:13.371
What?

42:15.140 --> 42:17.108
What the hell?

42:17.142 --> 42:19.610
J-Jesus--

42:19.644 --> 42:20.811
It's still here.

42:22.414 --> 42:25.082
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.

42:29.922 --> 42:32.958
You look me in the eye
and you tell me

42:32.992 --> 42:35.594
that you weren't at
his house last night.

42:36.596 --> 42:39.799
I, um...

42:39.833 --> 42:41.534
Look, I didn't have a chance.

42:41.569 --> 42:43.603
All right?

42:43.637 --> 42:45.940
Okay, I knew you would
react this way.

42:45.974 --> 42:47.808
I knew you would freak out

42:47.843 --> 42:49.010
and wouldn't
believe me--

42:49.044 --> 42:52.581
That's why I didn't
say anything.

42:52.615 --> 42:55.817
Look, there was just this
one big pot of stew, okay?

42:55.852 --> 42:57.486
He just made this one big pot,

42:57.520 --> 43:00.021
and we both ate from it--
What was I supposed to do?

43:00.055 --> 43:01.155
Huh? Poison myself?

43:01.189 --> 43:03.424
Two hours and 18 minutes,

43:03.458 --> 43:05.559
and you couldn't figure out
a way to give it to him.

43:05.593 --> 43:07.795
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!

43:08.997 --> 43:10.731
You had one thing to do!

43:10.765 --> 43:13.599
One thing! That is
the only thing, I might add,

43:13.634 --> 43:15.901
that would save our lives.

43:15.935 --> 43:18.704
Right there.
You were in his house!

43:18.738 --> 43:20.706
And you didn't have
the guts to do it.

43:25.178 --> 43:28.314
Two hours and 18 minutes?

43:28.348 --> 43:30.683
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

43:31.785 --> 43:34.854
How did you know I was
at his house last night?

43:34.888 --> 43:36.189
Were you following me?

43:39.993 --> 43:43.128
This.
This is how I knew.

43:47.133 --> 43:49.234
You bugged my car?

43:49.269 --> 43:51.670
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.

43:51.704 --> 43:53.438
Two hours and 18 minutes,

43:53.473 --> 43:55.574
but you had no intentions,
did you?

43:55.608 --> 43:58.911
Not the slightest intention.

43:58.945 --> 44:00.880
Everything that
I have done for you--

44:00.914 --> 44:04.183
You put a bug on my car?

44:04.217 --> 44:07.254
I'm sorry. After everything
you've done for me?

44:07.288 --> 44:09.523
What you've done for me?

44:09.557 --> 44:11.592
You've killed me
is what you've done.

44:11.626 --> 44:13.427
You've signed my death warrant.

44:13.462 --> 44:15.229
And now you want advice?

44:15.264 --> 44:16.397
All right,
I'll give you advice.

44:16.432 --> 44:19.333
Go to Mexico and screw up,
like I know you will,

44:19.368 --> 44:21.202
and wind up
in a barrel somewhere!

45:12.155 --> 45:13.556
Oh, God!

46:14.189 --> 46:16.457
Can you walk?

46:19.161 --> 46:20.728
Yeah.

46:20.763 --> 46:24.532
You get the fuck out of here
and never come back.

46:38.978 --> 46:40.012
Ohh!
