WEBVTT

00:25.400 --> 00:27.777
So, Judy's still asleep.
They think she's gonna be fine.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.988
Oh! Well, that's great news.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.699
Clark…

00:34.117 --> 00:35.702
I'm so sorry, man.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.039
-I'm sure your dad will be okay.
-Aw, thanks.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.875
Have there been
any updates on your dad's condition?

00:41.958 --> 00:43.877
Oh, not yet.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.337
Buddy, get in here.
I'm flyin' in for a hug.

00:46.421 --> 00:48.214
Um…

00:48.298 --> 00:49.758
-Ah, okay.
-Yeah!

00:50.341 --> 00:51.259
Now take it in.

00:53.344 --> 00:56.890
We are gonna go and get a little bit
of a snack, or something to drink.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.016
Can I get you anything?

00:58.099 --> 01:00.810
-I'm okay.
-Okay. Come on, let's go. You too.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.146
-Come on, Tom.
-Thank you.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.359
You know, I've been wondering
about something.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.237
I can't figure it out.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.865
Why wouldn't God help my dad?

01:15.116 --> 01:20.455
They say God works in mysterious ways.
Maybe… maybe this is one of those ways?

01:22.791 --> 01:24.876
What I can't figure out
is why you wouldn't…

01:24.959 --> 01:27.087
When you were
putting a spell on the house,

01:27.170 --> 01:28.963
why would you not
have also done the sauna,

01:29.047 --> 01:31.466
and the whole backyard, for that matter?

01:31.549 --> 01:33.593
I'm not gonna play the blame game here.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.970
Instead, I'm gonna
point the blame finger at me.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.682
Yeah, I'm putting both blame fingers
on you. That's what I'm doing.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.852
Chamuel asked me to secure the house.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.979
But then he did it himself, 'cause I…

01:45.063 --> 01:47.649
I'm pretty sure he thought
I wouldn't do it to his specifications.

01:47.732 --> 01:51.945
But in my defense,
he never filed the N919!

01:52.028 --> 01:54.906
That's the only way that
I could have ever Harry Pottered

01:54.989 --> 01:56.658
a Jacuzzi or a splash pool.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.409
-Or, I'm sorry, the sauna.
-Oh my God.

01:58.493 --> 02:02.163
Do you hear the gobbledygook
that comes out of your mouth?

02:02.247 --> 02:05.291
I'm so sorry, Clark. This is on me. Okay?

02:05.375 --> 02:07.377
I'm-- I'm so sorry about your dad.

02:07.460 --> 02:11.548
And I want you to know this hospital
will be a Satan-free zone in no time.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.634
You're-- you're telling us,
without any embarrassment,

02:15.301 --> 02:17.387
that you haven't done
anything here to protect us?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.889
-Although you could, you chose not to.
-Are you--

02:19.973 --> 02:22.934
I'm saying I'm bending the rules
so that we can get it done.

02:23.017 --> 02:23.893
Holy shit.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.354
-{Clark sighs]
-I'm gonna break and bend your legs.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.649
-I'm gonna break your legs.
-You should probably get movin' on that.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.110
-Go do something now.
-Making it safe.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.654
-I'm gonna. Every nook and cranny.
-Not paperwork.

02:34.737 --> 02:35.905
-No.
-Not paperwork.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.658
I'm gonna go do it. I'll Harry Potter
the whole place right now.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.493
Without doing the paperwork first.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.788
-I'm gonna break one leg, no matter what.
-Um… Oh!

02:43.872 --> 02:47.208
Ah… Hi, there. I'm Dr. Stevens.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.877
You're the family of Mr. Thompson?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.879
Uh, yeah. Uh, he's my dad.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.714
And I'm sleeping with him.

02:52.797 --> 02:55.425
-Him. Not him. It's…
-Oh-- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.135
Okay. Well.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.469
I'm very sorry to tell you this,

02:58.553 --> 03:01.139
but because of the prolonged
heat exposure,

03:01.222 --> 03:04.142
he sustained damage
to his brain and his kidneys.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.936
We've induced a coma
so that we can keep him stable

03:07.020 --> 03:09.522
until we can determine
the best course of treatment.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.481
Oh, wow.

03:10.565 --> 03:13.902
I knew it was bad, I didn't…
I didn't know it was that bad.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.738
Uh… Okay. Can I go, uh, see him?

03:17.322 --> 03:19.407
Absolutely. Of course. That's fine.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.992
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.832
-I'll be right here if you need me.
-Okay.

03:45.516 --> 03:46.809
Pop.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.313
I'm so sorry.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.441
I'm sorry I got… I got there too late.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.570
I couldn't stop Satan
from hurting you.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.824
I'm so sorry.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.036
I wish I'd done better.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.957
I was too slow.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.292
I was too slow…

04:11.376 --> 04:12.585
I've always been slow.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.129
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

04:30.853 --> 04:32.689
Well, here he is!

04:32.772 --> 04:34.732
The big faker himself.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.025
False prophet!

04:36.943 --> 04:40.613
You know, uh,
I'm on a new network now, Clark.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.783
America's Own Holy Network.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.035
Ayo… ohn…

04:46.577 --> 04:50.081
And now there are
many more eyes on God's prize.

04:50.164 --> 04:53.209
And we will not be fooled by your tricks.

04:53.293 --> 04:57.672
How <i>dare</i> you say
that everybody's right about God?

04:57.755 --> 04:59.424
-Everybody is right about God.
-No, Clark.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.510
-God told me that. It's true, actually.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.804
-Only we are right about God.

05:04.887 --> 05:07.098
-Only the righteous are right.
-That's right!

05:07.181 --> 05:09.142
Only the righteous are right!

05:09.225 --> 05:11.436
-Only the righteous are right! Yes please!
-Excuse me.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.688
Don't you walk away--

05:16.232 --> 05:19.819
Only the righteous are right.
Only the righteous are right!

05:23.614 --> 05:24.615
Yikes.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.540
<i>Clark Thompson, or the man</i>
<i>who glows, is back in the news,</i>

05:32.623 --> 05:36.711
<i>this time with a breakout article</i>
<i>that has just come out in </i>USA Today.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.923
<i>The journalist Judy Miller</i>
<i>recently published an article</i>

05:41.007 --> 05:43.301
<i>claiming Clark Thompson</i>
<i>is a messenger of God.</i>

05:43.384 --> 05:44.552
Hello?

05:44.635 --> 05:46.763
<i>She also claims</i>
<i>she witnessed divine phenomenon…</i>

05:46.846 --> 05:48.723
Who's watching TV?

05:48.806 --> 05:51.809
<i>…physically attacked by Satan,</i>
<i>who she says is a woman.</i>

05:53.811 --> 05:55.104
Uh, for the record,

05:55.188 --> 05:57.023
-I'm not a fun person to murder.
-Hey!

05:57.106 --> 05:59.108
-God!

05:59.734 --> 06:02.528
-Oh! Holy bugbears.
-I'm sorry. I di--

06:03.029 --> 06:05.740
-What did you… just say?
-I said holy bugbears.

06:05.823 --> 06:09.160
It's a very scary monster
from Dungeons & Dragons.

06:09.243 --> 06:12.163
That's what you say when you think
you're gonna be viciously murdered?

06:12.246 --> 06:15.041
May I have your… weapon? Or bumbershoot?

06:15.124 --> 06:17.085
Ah! Thank you.

06:17.168 --> 06:20.088
-How's your dad?
-Oh, he's, uh… he's okay.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.964
You know, serious but stable.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.258
The doctor said he would text me
if there's any changes.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.635
-Yeah.
-So I thought I'd come home

06:25.718 --> 06:27.512
and just catch a quick shower, and…

06:27.595 --> 06:31.641
And then I was so delighted to see that
you're in the house I thought was locked.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.352
Yeah, I just figure
I'm here all the time anyway.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.230
And, you know, it's Harry Pottered
so we could actually be safe here.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.898
So… I just made a key.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.317
That makes sense.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.736
I also brought over, uh, all my stuff.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.947
So… I thought we'd just live together.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.158
Awesome.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.284
Hmm.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.662
Also, for what it's worth,

06:52.745 --> 06:55.248
I, um… find it interesting

06:55.331 --> 06:59.252
that I'm not going on the date
with the… the truck driver.

06:59.335 --> 07:03.798
Well, you know. I also enjoy driving.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.260
It's just one of my hobbies.
Probably why we're so close.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.556
I made you something. I cooked food.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.308
-Oh.
-I just figured you'd be hungry.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.852
And hospital food's terrible.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.687
So I wanted to make you
a home-cooked meal.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.856
Oh! What am I doing? My God.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.524
-What am I doing? Here.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.402
I'm not sure
which way you wanna go at it, so…

07:25.695 --> 07:28.156
Um… it's… it's cut up hot dogs

07:28.239 --> 07:30.700
that I boiled
so long that the skins came off,

07:30.783 --> 07:32.618
-which I thought was a nice touch.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.664
It's on a bed of oatmeal because
I couldn't find a box of mashed potatoes.

07:36.747 --> 07:37.832
So I thought this could…

07:37.915 --> 07:41.043
I think once you mix it all up…
I think it'll be pretty-- pretty good.

07:41.627 --> 07:44.422
It looks a little bit
like severed… fingers.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.840
In just such a fun way.

07:45.923 --> 07:50.011
I thought so too. I thought they looked
like little, fat, uh… bloody toes.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.723
I thought that was kind of, you know, fun.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.057
And a protein and a carb.

07:55.141 --> 07:58.186
-It's the circle of life on a plate.
-And a vegetable. The ketchup.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.856
I cannot wait to dig into this.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.734
It's, uh, congealed a bit.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.068
That's…

08:07.653 --> 08:08.613
Mm--

08:09.197 --> 08:11.282
Oh wow. That has got some zing.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.700
It may be the soy sauce.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.703
I did taste soy sauce in there, didn't I?

08:15.786 --> 08:17.622
-I'm so glad you like it.
-Wow.

08:17.705 --> 08:18.664
Um…

08:18.748 --> 08:22.084
The only reason I'm not just,
like, mowing through this right now

08:22.168 --> 08:25.046
is I feel like I just need to jump
in the shower

08:25.129 --> 08:26.714
and wash the hospital off of me.

08:26.797 --> 08:30.384
Oh, totally.
You were on the news all morning.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.470
Did it work?
Is-- is Judy's article working?

08:34.805 --> 08:36.140
No, sorry.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.059
It just doesn't seem like they buy it.

08:38.142 --> 08:42.104
I don't know why, but people are
only willing to believe what they believe.

08:42.772 --> 08:43.773
Dang it.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.484
Well, what do I do? What do I do?

08:46.567 --> 08:48.194
I mean… okay.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.404
So, I'm not needed at the hospital.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.866
I don't wanna be here, because there's all
those people outside. That's scary.

08:53.950 --> 08:57.995
-Should I shower up and we go to work?
-Oh, shit. I keep forgetting I have a job.

08:58.079 --> 08:58.955
Meh.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.791
No, it was not a trick.

09:03.417 --> 09:06.337
Well, uh… no, thank you.
I'm not gonna do that to myself,

09:06.420 --> 09:08.673
and I'm not sure
that it's physically possible.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.550
Uh… Thank you for calling Arresta.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.469
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.805
How are you going
with getting the message out?

09:15.888 --> 09:19.725
Ah… Not so great. I've been calling
news editors and different people…

09:19.809 --> 09:20.977
Everyone thinks I'm a faker.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.980
Even people here think I'm a faker
and people saw me glow.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.190
It's crazy.
Just ignore them. It's all right.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.276
-I've got a bit of good news.
-Oh.

09:28.359 --> 09:32.738
So they ran a wee article about you
in the <i>Bay of Plenty Times</i> back home.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.739
"Faker."

09:34.323 --> 09:36.242
-Yeah.
-Well, every little bit helps, right?

09:36.325 --> 09:37.493
-Oh, definitely.
-Thanks.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.582
I also wanted to say that,
Clark, I'm so sorry about your dad.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.459
-Thank you.
-Anyway, I got you something.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.337
-What?
-I know you're going through a lot.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.007
It's only small. But there you go.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.174
Wow.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.261
It's a candle.

09:55.845 --> 09:56.971
You can burn it.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.348
-Love it.
-It's all natural.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.435
-Thank you so much. That's so great.
-Oh, you're welcome.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.650
Whew!

10:10.401 --> 10:12.361
That is a very natural smelling candle.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.286
God damn it, you insidious beast.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.288
-Oh.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.498
-Tough cube, huh?
-Tough cube?

10:25.249 --> 10:26.250
It has 12 sides.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.837
Which is twice as many sides as my last
cube, which makes it 48 times harder.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.797
But I have to solve it.
Wendy gave it to me.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.549
Oh, so that's going well.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.218
I'm so sorry. I don't mean to pry.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.513
You're not prying. It's just…
The short answer is I hope so.

10:40.097 --> 10:43.225
-She thinks I'm nice.
-Well, you… you are nice.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.226
Oh, thank you.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.688
-Oh no.
-What?

10:48.522 --> 10:51.901
I'm in the same puzzle situation
that I was in early this morning.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.028
Or maybe it was last night. I don't know.

10:54.111 --> 10:57.073
Time and space has no meaning
when it comes to this cube.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.158
Is it even a cube? What do you think? Huh?

10:59.241 --> 11:01.285
It has a zillion different sides. Right?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.788
The potential algorithms.
They're limitless.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.581
I don't even know what side is up!

11:06.290 --> 11:07.833
Maybe there is no up.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.713
Maybe there's no up.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.966
-I don't know.
-Oh my God. Clark, that is brilliant.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.845
Maybe it doesn't have an up.
Maybe I… Maybe I don't have an up.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.182
Right? Maybe up is down.
Down is up. Maybe I should…

11:23.265 --> 11:25.768
Maybe I need to do things
a little differently. I just…

11:25.851 --> 11:28.771
Mohsin is a little too, you know, stern.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.024
Maybe I need to, like, calm down,
relax a bit, dance.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.236
Maybe a little music.
You could play music for me, couldn't you?

11:35.319 --> 11:37.446
-Like, try to make--
-No, no. You know what?

11:37.530 --> 11:40.241
I'm sorry. You don't have to.
You've got way too much on your plate.

11:40.324 --> 11:43.911
God. It's just-- It is just so--
It's so quiet over here without Tom.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.997
I hate to say it. Without Tom,
without Frisbee, it's-- it's quiet.

11:47.081 --> 11:50.334
It's too quiet to solve a cube, anyway.
Where do you think they are?

11:50.418 --> 11:53.003
Uh, well, I know Tom is at the hospital
guarding my dad

11:53.087 --> 11:55.297
'cause he did not trust Frisbee
to Satan-proof it.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.260
Demon or regular person?

12:00.219 --> 12:01.721
You shall not pa…

12:01.804 --> 12:04.306
Oh, Diane.
Yeah, sure. Yeah, you're cleared. Yeah.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.016
You having a good day today?

12:07.643 --> 12:09.186
You know what's so weird?

12:09.270 --> 12:12.857
None of that sounds crazy anymore.
Maybe we're all just going crazy.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.275
What do you think? I don't know.

12:14.358 --> 12:17.903
Do you think Frisbee is part of that
intergalactic God war

12:17.987 --> 12:19.572
that's going on up there, or, uh…

12:19.655 --> 12:22.742
-It's a really hard thing to visualize.
-He's a very sedentary man, yeah.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.118
Um…

12:24.201 --> 12:25.953
But I kind of have a problem.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.705
-What is it?
-It's, uh…

12:27.788 --> 12:29.331
-Is it a cube?
-It's this.

12:30.458 --> 12:31.417
Oh, what's that?

12:31.500 --> 12:34.211
Oh, my God. Is that…
Oh. Is that, like, something you…

12:34.295 --> 12:37.548
Is that something you need to destroy?
Is that, like, a task from God?

12:37.631 --> 12:38.591
Is that…

12:38.674 --> 12:40.134
Oh my God. What is that smell?

12:40.217 --> 12:42.470
-Put it… Close it!

12:42.553 --> 12:45.306
-It's a candle. Wendy gave me this candle.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.600
The candle is the smell
because it's natural.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.018
It's naturally god-awful.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.770
-Smells like a man whose dick--

12:50.853 --> 12:51.937
Hi, guys.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.273
-Hey,
-Oh, hey. I was just, um…

12:54.356 --> 12:56.942
showing Mohsin the candle you gave me.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.445
Great! I'm so pleased you like it.
I've gotta get back to work.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.698
Yeah. Somebody over here
should be doing some kind of real work.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.743
Yeah, that's right. Look at you.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.162
Working on your cube, eh?

13:08.245 --> 13:12.124
A candle, a cube. Wendy is everywhere.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.376
Where… where… where…

13:15.169 --> 13:18.756
That was just a little something
in response to your something.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.049
-Right.
-It was good.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.967
-Yeah.
-Okay. I'm out.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.679
Why did you bring me into this?

13:25.763 --> 13:27.890
-I didn't mean to, but now you're into it.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.309
I can't leave this on my desk.
It could kill somebody.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.187
-I have to go see my dad. What do I do?
-I have a plan.

13:33.270 --> 13:34.688
Oh, thank goodness.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.530
-Okay. Now what?
-Well, that's it. That's the plan.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.990
The plan was just to bring
the candle to Frisbee's office?

13:45.074 --> 13:47.493
Sometimes the simplest plans
are the best plans, all right?

13:47.576 --> 13:51.997
We'll just tell Wendy we're leaving it
here on Frisbee's desk for safekeeping.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.083
-Okay?
-Okay, well, can… can you tell her?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.584
I don't really like lying.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.380
Hey, stranger.

13:59.463 --> 14:00.798
-What's going on?
-Hi!

14:00.881 --> 14:02.383
Oh, you know. Same old.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.803
Same old, same old.
Plus a bunch of weird stuff, and…

14:06.512 --> 14:07.805
This and that, and…

14:08.389 --> 14:10.641
You know, a… a couple of days ago,

14:11.475 --> 14:13.686
Clark told me he loved me, so…

14:17.064 --> 14:18.315
-Oh, Amily.
-Now--

14:20.943 --> 14:22.194
That's great!

14:22.778 --> 14:25.364
-What did you say back?
-Well, nothing.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.950
Oh. Okay.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.872
Maybe it's just
a bit too soon for you to know?

14:34.081 --> 14:37.042
Maybe you don't feel the same way.
That's a bit awkward.

14:37.626 --> 14:42.089
I don't know, and that's what's weird,.
I always know what to say or what to do.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.216
I mean, even if I have no idea
what I'm talking about,

14:44.300 --> 14:46.802
I still, you know, forge ahead as if I do.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.554
-Mm.
-Now I moved in with…

14:49.179 --> 14:51.682
I moved in with somebody and then I'm not…

14:52.349 --> 14:54.435
I'm not sure what I'm feeling.

14:54.518 --> 14:58.898
Moving in with someone
that you don't know your feelings for

14:58.981 --> 15:01.483
is very on brand for you, I will say that.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.486
-Yeah. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.489
Was Clark mad that you didn't say it back?

15:08.949 --> 15:11.285
No, he wasn't… he wasn't mad. He, um…

15:12.369 --> 15:14.538
He said he doesn't need me to say it back.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.541
Then at the same time, he made a…

15:18.292 --> 15:21.503
bunch of dead flowers come back to life.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.798
-Wowee.
-Yeah.

15:25.716 --> 15:30.304
The crazy thing is that Clark's bringing
a bunch of dead flowers back to life

15:30.387 --> 15:32.806
doesn't actually sound
all that crazy to me anymore.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.058
I know, right?

15:35.809 --> 15:39.939
Well, look. You like Clark,
a little bit, at least, right?

15:40.022 --> 15:40.940
Well,

15:41.774 --> 15:44.318
I mean, what's not to like, you know?
It's, uh…

15:46.236 --> 15:50.366
You know I'm not
very good at… feeling my feelings.

15:51.033 --> 15:51.867
But

15:52.826 --> 15:54.328
I worry about him, you know?

15:54.411 --> 15:56.580
-He's got a lot on his shoulders.
-True.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.669
I think that you
should go easy on yourself,

16:01.752 --> 16:03.671
and just see what happens.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.547
Because it seems like

16:06.715 --> 16:08.842
we are the only people
that are aware of the fact

16:08.926 --> 16:11.387
that it's quite possibly not all that long

16:11.470 --> 16:12.763
until the end of the world.

16:12.846 --> 16:14.139
-Right? I know.
-Yes.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.058
Thanks, Wendy.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.978
You're welcome.
Sorry to bring the vibe down.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.605
-Ah…
-Great shirt. You look fantastic.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.358
Thank you.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.156
I'm very sorry
that I don't have better news,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.534
but his condition hasn't improved.

16:33.617 --> 16:37.746
He has extensive damage to his kidneys,
unknown amount of damage to his brain.

16:38.622 --> 16:43.711
Not right now, but soon, we might want
to start discussing our options.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.132
I'll let you be.

16:48.924 --> 16:49.758
Thank you.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.395
Chamuel, can you hear me?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.398
Please. Are you listening?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.487
-<i>Chamuel, please.</i>

17:10.571 --> 17:15.367
Oh, I'm gonna chop you up
and use you as dental floss!

17:15.451 --> 17:16.702
That made zero sense.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.123
It makes perfect sense.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.584
-You're insane.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.960
Thank you.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.051
Hand pike.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.055
Hey! Hey! That's the SC!
It's a classic. I can't replace it.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.682
The desk is off limits, everybody.
It's neutral ground.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.643
Frisbee! Frisbee!

17:41.727 --> 17:44.063
Tell Clark I can't come down right now.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.899
-I'm really busy trying to stay alive.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.736
Oh, no. Are you bleeding? You never bleed.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.821
-Oh. I guess I do now.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.702
Ooh. Shield.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.624
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.667
Chamuel, I really need your help.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.505
I need your help right now.
If you can hear me, please.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.132
<i>-Please.</i>
Come on, Frisbee. Tell Clark.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.759
Can't do it, bud. I gotta take notes,

18:13.842 --> 18:16.345
to make sure everybody
follows the rules in the battle.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.972
For example,
you just did a stab with a sword,

18:19.056 --> 18:20.933
which would be SS151.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.228
-And a great job, so I'll put two pluses--
-Oh! Shut up, Frisbee.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.524
Who just went in the infinity chasm?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.859
Was it-- It looked-- Was it Balthamore?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.778
-Or was it Baphomet?

18:39.785 --> 18:40.702
Aw.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.539
Bye, bitch.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.710
Dang it, Chamuel.

18:56.426 --> 18:57.469
How's he doin'?

18:59.221 --> 19:01.140
A little worse, I think?

19:04.017 --> 19:06.562
Hey. Thanks for lookin' after my pop.

19:07.146 --> 19:07.980
You kiddin' me?

19:08.564 --> 19:09.690
I'm happy to do it.

19:10.357 --> 19:14.987
Also, I don't trust Frisbee
to Harry Potter anything.

19:15.070 --> 19:17.447
Let alone a whole hospital? Please.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.450
I did read the CliffsNotes
to <i>Harry Potter,</i>

19:20.534 --> 19:22.661
and I'm afraid I don't really
get the reference,

19:22.744 --> 19:25.372
but maybe it just means
I need to read the whole thing.

19:25.455 --> 19:28.917
But there's, like, ten books,
so I thought, "Aah, just forget it."

19:30.419 --> 19:32.796
-I think you're pretty tired.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.215
You should maybe head home
and get some sleep?

19:35.299 --> 19:38.010
No, no, no, absolu… No, of course not.

19:38.093 --> 19:41.763
I'm standing guard, you know?
This is my place in your time of need.

19:41.847 --> 19:45.225
You're doin' the Lord's work,
so I gotta do your work.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.895
And hopefully that works.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.856
Work. Work…

19:50.939 --> 19:52.608
-Work, work, work…
-I think you're kind of…

19:52.691 --> 19:55.110
sleepin' just a little bit
on your feet, okay?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.862
You know what? Maybe I will…

19:57.362 --> 19:59.448
-Yeah. I'll get a coffee.
-Okay.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.867
I'm gonna keep the sword. Yeah.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.493
I'll keep that.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.962
You know. I've been thinking.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.925
Maybe I'm not cut out for
this service of God thing. I mean, it's…

20:18.425 --> 20:21.303
I'm clearly not very good at it.
There's so much responsibility.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.639
People are getting hurt
all over the place.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.224
It could keep continuing.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.185
I mean, I don't know. There…

20:28.268 --> 20:32.272
It's very overwhelming, and there has to be
somebody more qualified than me to do it.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.649
Clark, God chose you.

20:34.691 --> 20:38.737
And who are we to say that God chose
wrong? I don't think God chose wrong.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.239
I think God chose right.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.784
I know that if I needed someone

20:43.867 --> 20:45.577
to really do the right thing…

20:47.329 --> 20:48.455
I'd choose you too.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.543
I always forget which day is trash day.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.713
Truly.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.342
Ah, I just put my garbage
in my neighbor's yard, so…

21:02.094 --> 21:03.595
That's another way to go.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.722
That's not what it's about.

21:06.223 --> 21:09.935
It's about, probably, that you worry about
that you don't know when garbage day is.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.561
I don't even think about it.

21:13.355 --> 21:16.275
Well. Either way,
you might have bad taste.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.610
-Oh, yeah, I got a bad picker.
-You might. Yeah.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.405
-Ugh! What is that smell?

21:21.488 --> 21:23.282
Hi, guys. How are you going?

21:23.365 --> 21:24.992
Wendy, what is that smell?

21:25.075 --> 21:26.076
That smell?

21:26.159 --> 21:30.080
Oh, I don't know. I've got a terrible
sense of smell, generally speaking,

21:30.163 --> 21:33.041
and it's due to the fact that
my bloomin' cousin Monica dared me

21:33.125 --> 21:36.336
to put two ignited sparklers straight
up my nostrils when we were both 11.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.421
Bloody bitch.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.841
Anyhow, I digress.
Clark, you forgot your candle.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.844
I saw you left it in Frisbee's office
and I didn't--

21:43.927 --> 21:46.847
-Ooh my! Oh my!
-No, no, no, no, no!

21:46.930 --> 21:48.015
Lid it! Lid it!

21:48.098 --> 21:50.851
-Lid it? Oh.
-I'm so sorry she found it.

21:50.934 --> 21:55.689
That smells like an entire rugby team
is forced to live in one tiny room.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.816
And they're only allowed
to eat lamb sausage.

21:57.899 --> 22:01.778
And they share the same jockstrap
without a washing machine.

22:01.862 --> 22:05.282
And that jockstrap
has been rebirthed in that…

22:06.700 --> 22:07.659
In that candle.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.869
Is it really that bad?

22:08.952 --> 22:12.497
-It's a really unfortunate smelling thing.
-Look at Mohsin.

22:12.581 --> 22:15.208
-Mohsin looks like he's about to yack.
-Smells like the worst part

22:15.292 --> 22:17.544
-of the men's locker room.
-Which would be balls.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.421
It smells like balls.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.923
-Oof.
-I mean, subterranean,

22:22.007 --> 22:25.177
dead of summer, New York subway balls.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.345
I don't understand.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.472
-Look, it says that it's gentle.
-Okay…

22:29.723 --> 22:32.601
Oh, no, not… That says <i>génitaux.</i>

22:32.684 --> 22:35.896
Uh…
Which is, uh… French for "genitals."

22:35.979 --> 22:39.566
Who would make a candle that smells
like genitals? That's revolting.

22:39.649 --> 22:40.817
The French.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.536
There's actually a ton
of weird-smelling candles out there.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.205
Some of these smell like hooves.

22:53.288 --> 22:56.291
-What kind of hooves?
-I don't know. It just says hooves.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.252
-Don't get any ideas.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.713
Where's Tom?

23:02.923 --> 23:03.924
-I don't know.
-He was--

23:04.007 --> 23:06.093
I feel like he was just here.

23:07.386 --> 23:10.180
He was really tired. He's not asleep
on the floor somewhere, is he?

23:11.098 --> 23:11.932
Tom?

23:12.641 --> 23:14.643
-Sh! People are sick.
-Right. Of course.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.186
Tom!

23:16.269 --> 23:18.647
-Oh, gosh. He's--
-Tomithy!

23:29.408 --> 23:30.492
Hey, buddy.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.371
-Ah…
-How you doin'?

23:36.081 --> 23:37.082
Not good, honestly.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.668
You've been here a long time. I--

23:39.751 --> 23:42.045
It might be time
to go home and get a little rest.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.005
You should take it easy a little.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.925
You need to keep up your vitamin C, buddy.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.594
I'm sorry, are you--
Are you guys hearing yourselves?

23:50.220 --> 23:52.764
No, no. I have to stay here.
This is my duty.

23:53.473 --> 23:56.101
Okay? Look,
no matter how fucked up shit gets…

23:56.184 --> 23:59.438
And shit's fucked up. Look, Clark.
Satan tried to murder your dad.

24:00.355 --> 24:02.149
Tried to nuke that reporter,
who, by the way,

24:02.232 --> 24:04.776
wrote that article we needed her to
and no one believed her.

24:04.860 --> 24:08.530
There's angels and demons having
an epic battle in another dimension,

24:08.613 --> 24:10.198
and God's side is losing.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.909
How could God lose?

24:14.327 --> 24:17.747
I'm having a really hard time
understanding any of this.

24:17.831 --> 24:20.709
Clark, look at your dad, man.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.924
He's in a really bad way,
and frankly…

24:30.260 --> 24:31.094
so am I.

24:32.721 --> 24:34.055
Oh, Tom.

24:48.862 --> 24:49.863
Who are you?

24:50.947 --> 24:52.073
-Pop.
-Oh!

24:52.574 --> 24:55.202
Uh, my-- my name is Tom. I'm Tom.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.996
Did you guys see that? Did you--

24:58.079 --> 24:59.164
-Oh…
-My tear.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.791
-I'm like that guy. Who's that guy?
-Hi, Pop.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.878
John! John the Baptist!
I'm like-- I'm like John the Baptist.

25:04.961 --> 25:08.423
'Cause I baptized you with my tear.
Right? I'm Tom the Baptist!

25:08.507 --> 25:09.841
John the Baptist didn't--

25:10.467 --> 25:13.303
-You know what? It's fine.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.055
Good job, Tom.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.225
-Nice, Tom.
-Whoo!

25:18.308 --> 25:20.185
-Tom! Tom! Tom!
-We'll give it to you, Tom.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.269
We'll give it to you, Tom.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.230
-Tom! Tom! Tom!
-Me! Me! Me!

25:23.313 --> 25:25.398
Yes, me! Yes, me! Ha, ha!

25:25.482 --> 25:26.775
Oh, my God.

25:26.858 --> 25:30.654
-Whoa!
-Oh, my God. You did it!
