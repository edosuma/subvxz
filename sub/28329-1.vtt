WEBVTT

00:55.365 --> 00:56.899
I need counter measures.

00:56.901 --> 00:58.867
<i>They've blown through
our outer defenses.</i>

00:58.869 --> 01:01.637
You better fall back
to our position.

01:14.652 --> 01:16.217
I can feel them.

01:16.219 --> 01:17.853
They're here
for the Time Ship.

01:17.855 --> 01:20.489
Reckless, but logical.

01:20.491 --> 01:24.462
However I should be able to jury-rig
a booby trap into the sphere.

01:26.263 --> 01:27.696
If they do get past us,

01:27.698 --> 01:30.466
they'll be frozen in time
as soon as they power up.

01:30.468 --> 01:31.900
How much time do you need?

01:37.075 --> 01:38.476
More than we have.

01:39.511 --> 01:40.712
We can hold them.

01:44.149 --> 01:47.183
- Don't worry.
- I'm fine.

01:47.185 --> 01:49.686
You're overdue for an
injection and your concern...

01:49.688 --> 01:52.722
I'm fine. And stay out of my
head, please, Saturn Girl.

01:52.724 --> 01:54.524
We've got more pressing...

02:00.165 --> 02:01.499
Kill them.

02:43.810 --> 02:45.311
I didn't finish!

02:47.980 --> 02:49.347
Thomas, no!

03:47.341 --> 03:48.542
Look out!

04:00.420 --> 04:01.990
You all right, son?

04:02.790 --> 04:03.791
Uh-huh.

04:06.860 --> 04:09.896
You really kept your cool
in a dangerous situation.

04:09.898 --> 04:12.100
But next time,
it's okay to run.

04:14.035 --> 04:17.038
Now...
What exactly are you?

04:22.877 --> 04:26.045
Legion flight ring,
I forgot all about you.

04:26.047 --> 04:27.715
How can I forget?

04:37.025 --> 04:39.161
That's... Not great.

04:47.835 --> 04:50.003
Slipping away.
Can't forget.

04:50.005 --> 04:51.138
Have to remember.

04:51.140 --> 04:53.174
Have to...

04:58.614 --> 04:59.982
Ah, finally.

05:03.953 --> 05:06.753
Hi, I need quatroclozapine
right away.

05:06.755 --> 05:08.855
- What?
- Quatroclozapine.

05:08.857 --> 05:12.092
This is an emergency.
You have to give it to me.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.493
Okay. I don't know
what that is.

05:14.495 --> 05:16.297
I don't know what
you're supposed to be,

05:16.299 --> 05:18.099
but you need to calm down.

05:18.101 --> 05:20.802
It's the most common mental
stabilizer in the galaxy. Come on.

05:20.804 --> 05:24.838
My last dose is wearing off,
and you know how fast that stuff...

05:24.840 --> 05:26.307
Oh, this is the past.

05:26.309 --> 05:28.542
You're scared of the costume.
Got it, got it.

05:28.544 --> 05:30.046
I can fix that.

05:32.349 --> 05:34.648
What the hell?

05:34.650 --> 05:37.020
Wait, no, no, no!
I just need my...

05:37.821 --> 05:39.222
...meds.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.131
Not this. Not this.
Geez, this one is poison.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.399
This isn't it.

05:51.401 --> 05:52.934
Okay, take it easy.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.736
Everything's gonna be
just fine.

05:54.738 --> 05:56.070
Is that what you think?

05:56.072 --> 05:58.307
Because it's not.
Everything is terrible,

05:58.309 --> 06:02.243
and worst thing about it is,
I can't remember why.

06:02.245 --> 06:04.579
I can't remember.

06:04.581 --> 06:07.383
Okay, buddy.
Let's get you to a nice...

06:09.486 --> 06:11.019
Freeze! Hands on your head!

06:11.021 --> 06:12.020
I'm... I'm sorry.

06:12.022 --> 06:13.224
I didn't...

06:30.474 --> 06:31.907
Where do you think
you're going?

06:31.909 --> 06:33.275
Twenty-one bridges.
Count 'em.

06:33.277 --> 06:35.177
I have to find the Limelight.
Let me go.

06:39.083 --> 06:42.253
Lime... Light...

07:39.344 --> 07:42.379
No, no!
Please, no! Please, no!

08:33.733 --> 08:36.434
Every day, in every way,

08:36.436 --> 08:38.438
I'm getting better and better.

08:41.575 --> 08:43.376
What a load of crap.

08:47.614 --> 08:50.450
<i>It's still a struggle
just to get out of bed.</i>

08:53.786 --> 08:56.223
<i>My brain is like
a hamster wheel.</i>

08:59.927 --> 09:01.527
<i>I feel fuzzy.</i>

09:01.529 --> 09:05.232
<i>Like I'm full of cotton
and I can't breathe right.</i>

09:15.976 --> 09:18.777
<i>I get to the door and I
imagine all these awful things</i>

09:18.779 --> 09:22.115
<i>that could be on the other
side, and I'm paralyzed.</i>

09:42.069 --> 09:43.837
It wasn't your fault.

09:45.273 --> 09:46.673
What wasn't?

09:46.675 --> 09:48.074
Surviving.

09:48.076 --> 09:50.976
What you experienced
was a terrible trauma.

09:50.978 --> 09:53.379
It's going to take time
to heal.

09:53.381 --> 09:56.650
It's been three years. I just
need some kind of trick...

09:56.652 --> 09:58.220
Pills... Something.

09:59.088 --> 10:01.153
Did you try using the mantra?

10:01.155 --> 10:02.154
Yeah.

10:02.156 --> 10:04.058
Not really working for me.

10:04.593 --> 10:05.858
At all.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.894
Then you should create
your own mantra.

10:07.896 --> 10:09.929
One that works just for you.

10:09.931 --> 10:11.797
How about... I give up?

10:11.799 --> 10:13.065
Everything is terrifying,

10:13.067 --> 10:15.902
and I'm not going to
do this job.

10:15.904 --> 10:17.604
Let's talk about this new job.

10:17.606 --> 10:20.775
It seems like it's
exacerbating your anxiety.

10:21.943 --> 10:24.146
Well, it is sort of stressful.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.381
A security position, right?

10:27.383 --> 10:29.483
Maybe this isn't
the right job for you.

10:29.485 --> 10:32.653
I didn't choose it.
It kinda chose me.

10:34.658 --> 10:37.026
Speaking of, that's work.

10:38.926 --> 10:41.096
We're out of time
anyway, right?

10:56.546 --> 10:57.844
Jessica Cruz.

10:57.846 --> 11:00.348
Power Ring now running
at 18 percent.

11:00.350 --> 11:02.617
Recharge is strongly advised.

11:02.619 --> 11:05.055
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

11:15.865 --> 11:17.199
Terrific.

11:21.504 --> 11:25.039
Jessica, why are you
ignoring our calls?

11:25.041 --> 11:26.207
Call J'onn.

11:26.209 --> 11:27.874
J'onn is off-world,

11:27.876 --> 11:29.644
fighting Dominators on Rann.

11:29.646 --> 11:32.448
We need you to step up.

11:32.450 --> 11:36.884
It's a fight just to get out
of my apartment.

11:36.886 --> 11:38.319
I keep telling you,

11:38.321 --> 11:41.155
this is all one big mistake.

11:41.157 --> 11:44.126
This thing probably
won't even work for me.

11:44.128 --> 11:45.495
Jesus!

12:01.412 --> 12:03.548
Doesn't look like
a mistake to me.

12:04.948 --> 12:07.016
You've got what it takes,
Jessica.

12:08.119 --> 12:10.321
So stop screening our calls.

12:17.094 --> 12:18.728
Jessica Cruz.

12:18.730 --> 12:22.667
You have the ability
to overcome great fear.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.802
You're a ring.

12:25.804 --> 12:27.405
You don't know dick.

12:29.940 --> 12:31.975
<i>President Kennedy.</i>

12:31.977 --> 12:34.209
You've got two minutes
to show yourself,

12:34.211 --> 12:35.812
and prove once and for all,

12:35.814 --> 12:37.514
that your "assassination"

12:37.516 --> 12:40.250
was nothing
more than a hoax!

12:40.252 --> 12:43.986
Or Gotham's number one
news team gets canceled.

12:43.988 --> 12:46.623
And if you think you can
take me out first,

12:46.625 --> 12:48.558
then everyone goes.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.127
Simple as that.

12:51.129 --> 12:53.797
Where the hell
is that weather girl?

12:53.799 --> 12:55.634
Right here, Mr. Bloodsport.

12:58.036 --> 12:59.670
What took you so long?

12:59.672 --> 13:01.372
It's freakin' hot!

13:01.374 --> 13:04.374
Well, there's a tropical high
pressure system moving in...

13:04.376 --> 13:05.377
Shut up.

13:08.313 --> 13:10.013
What're you lookin' at?

13:11.550 --> 13:12.617
I see you!

13:17.824 --> 13:19.292
Who the hell are you?

13:22.027 --> 13:24.662
I'm Miss Martian, jackass.

13:26.799 --> 13:30.403
You just stopped the show
forever, little girl.

13:40.947 --> 13:43.149
Killed it. Team supreme.

13:46.687 --> 13:49.753
You gave away our presence,
let him get to you,

13:49.755 --> 13:51.020
failed to take him out,

13:51.022 --> 13:53.057
and almost got
the hostages killed.

13:53.059 --> 13:56.193
Okay, maybe this was
a teachable moment.

13:56.195 --> 13:57.929
You want to be part of
the Justice League,

13:57.931 --> 13:59.663
there are better teachers
than me.

13:59.665 --> 14:01.702
I'm not doing this
with a teenager.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.540
Point taken.

14:08.542 --> 14:09.710
Don't push it.

14:15.082 --> 14:17.315
You know the
last time I spent this long

14:17.317 --> 14:19.252
on something
with no results?

14:19.786 --> 14:21.018
Never.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.587
It's never happened before.

14:22.589 --> 14:25.390
Hmm.
Frustrated, Mr. Terrific?

14:25.392 --> 14:27.860
Are you kidding?
I'm in heaven.

14:27.862 --> 14:29.126
I love a challenge,

14:29.128 --> 14:31.263
and I finally have
a real puzzle here.

14:31.265 --> 14:34.466
One I can attack with logic
and scientific method.

14:34.468 --> 14:37.403
Hmm. Have you tried using
Nth metal to cut it?

14:37.405 --> 14:41.072
I had Hawkgirl try to bash the hell out
of it with that big-ass mace of hers

14:41.074 --> 14:43.208
just before she went back
to Thanagar.

14:43.210 --> 14:45.311
- Nothing.
- Seriously?

14:45.313 --> 14:47.846
Hey, if it ain't real fun,
it ain't real science.

14:47.848 --> 14:50.584
Aren't you just dying to know
what's in there?

14:54.121 --> 14:56.088
Weird. It's not lead.

14:56.090 --> 14:59.157
My X-ray vision should be able
to see right through this.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.628
Unless...

15:01.963 --> 15:03.598
It's not really here.

15:04.799 --> 15:06.398
Out of phase with us.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.768
Just out of sync
with our time.

15:08.770 --> 15:10.036
Not bad, Supe.

15:10.038 --> 15:11.804
You are your father's son.

15:11.806 --> 15:13.472
My dad was a farmer.

15:13.474 --> 15:15.609
I meant the other one.

15:15.611 --> 15:18.479
High-speed particle
bombardment. Test 1A.

15:19.881 --> 15:21.082
Fire.

15:32.695 --> 15:34.095
It's a ship.

15:43.606 --> 15:45.204
Great Rao!

15:45.206 --> 15:48.209
Superman. We've come
to the right place.

16:04.526 --> 16:05.527
Freeze!

17:26.277 --> 17:27.977
We're wasting time here.

17:27.979 --> 17:28.980
Move!

17:38.056 --> 17:39.256
Superman!

17:40.825 --> 17:42.693
Come on, buddy.
Stay with me.

17:45.296 --> 17:46.830
I will find him!

17:46.832 --> 17:49.364
You monsters can't hide
the truth forever!

17:49.366 --> 17:50.866
This isn't finished.

17:50.868 --> 17:52.436
This isn't finished!

17:53.571 --> 17:55.205
We'll take him
from here, Batman.

17:55.207 --> 17:58.341
You really have a knack for
finding top-shelf lunatics.

17:58.343 --> 18:00.176
Any luck with
our mystery guest?

18:00.178 --> 18:03.378
I still haven't found a match
for the name Thomas Kallor.

18:03.380 --> 18:05.014
Or for his fingerprints,

18:05.016 --> 18:07.317
as if he doesn't exist.

18:07.319 --> 18:08.650
He's paranoid schizophrenic,

18:08.652 --> 18:10.519
but his delusions
are completely entrenched.

18:10.521 --> 18:12.354
Real space cadet stuff.

18:12.356 --> 18:14.225
His meds keep him calm,

18:14.227 --> 18:16.659
but nothing seems to snap him
out of his delusional condition.

18:16.661 --> 18:17.995
Tell you one thing, though.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.896
He's been here ten months,
and so far,

18:19.898 --> 18:21.231
he's a model patient.

18:25.071 --> 18:28.039
They're a lot better,
now that I know not to chew them.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.483
Beat it, punk.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.687
Thomas, what have I told you?

18:43.689 --> 18:46.824
Lots of these guys, they're
just looking for an excuse.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.826
Stay clear.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.495
I know, I know.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.833
Are you eating for two again?

18:56.835 --> 18:59.906
How about I rip just
one of your lungs out?

19:01.841 --> 19:02.842
Sorry.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.709
It's okay.
That's why we're here.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.510
You think you're two people,

19:07.512 --> 19:09.515
I think I'm really here in the
past, but I'm from the present.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.715
I love presents.

19:11.717 --> 19:12.886
Oh, boy.

19:25.865 --> 19:28.133
Five... Five!

19:28.135 --> 19:30.035
Five, five, five!

19:30.037 --> 19:31.670
Hey. Take it easy, kid.

19:31.672 --> 19:33.338
No, not easy! Hard!

19:33.340 --> 19:36.807
Time travel is really hard and
I'm really here in the past!

19:36.809 --> 19:39.144
And so are they!
Gotta stop 'em.

19:39.146 --> 19:40.579
I gotta stop 'em!

19:40.581 --> 19:43.381
Your model patient is
about to start a riot.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.016
No, no, no!
They want the Limelight.

19:45.018 --> 19:46.584
I can't let them get
to Limelight.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.051
The Fatal Five are coming!

20:19.053 --> 20:20.987
They want the Limelight!!

20:48.683 --> 20:50.085
Okay, then.

20:51.486 --> 20:54.620
Here's something I meant to
give you back at the studio.

21:01.096 --> 21:02.194
You're welcome.

21:02.196 --> 21:04.364
I told you to wait in the car.

21:04.366 --> 21:06.432
It's hot in the car.

21:14.843 --> 21:17.511
I didn't know
you had powers, Thomas.

21:17.513 --> 21:19.846
I thought those cops
were exaggerating.

21:19.848 --> 21:21.917
Have to find the bridges.
21 bridges.

21:24.720 --> 21:27.556
I tried to tell you. I'm on
a very important mission.

21:42.205 --> 21:44.975
Mano...

21:46.176 --> 21:48.144
Mano...

21:52.382 --> 21:53.817
My Empress.

21:54.217 --> 21:55.515
My love.

21:55.517 --> 21:59.052
An ocean of stars
between us, and still...

21:59.054 --> 22:00.522
I felt you.

22:02.359 --> 22:03.891
Where the hell
have you been?

22:03.893 --> 22:07.463
I've been doing hard time
in this craphole for a year!

22:07.465 --> 22:09.529
Unforeseen complications,

22:09.531 --> 22:10.898
but we are coming.

22:10.900 --> 22:13.201
We need only find the key.

22:13.203 --> 22:14.204
Good.

22:15.206 --> 22:16.941
Come to me, my love.

22:18.008 --> 22:20.108
<i>Free me.</i>

22:20.110 --> 22:23.079
<i>Validus and I have waited
so long.</i>

22:35.693 --> 22:37.592
I came as soon as I heard.

22:37.594 --> 22:38.793
Are you all right?

22:38.795 --> 22:41.463
Been a while since I bled.

22:41.465 --> 22:42.765
Kryptonite?

22:42.767 --> 22:44.666
No, some kind of axe.

22:44.668 --> 22:48.037
Atomic. Had to be sharpened to
less than a nanometer to cut him.

22:48.039 --> 22:51.073
My T-Spheres have been
collecting residue from the axe.

22:51.075 --> 22:52.941
Based on
the residual tachyons,

22:52.943 --> 22:56.146
this substance comes from
approximately 1,000 years

22:56.148 --> 22:57.747
in the future.

22:58.382 --> 22:59.882
Who are they?

22:59.884 --> 23:01.183
I don't know,

23:01.185 --> 23:02.853
but I think I know where
they're headed.

23:06.390 --> 23:07.956
It's just a building, Megan.

23:07.958 --> 23:09.725
Don't be intimidated.

23:09.727 --> 23:11.693
I'm not. I've been here
lots of times.

23:11.695 --> 23:12.996
Just not...

23:12.998 --> 23:15.564
Not as an actual
Justice League member.

23:15.566 --> 23:17.833
Potential initiate.

23:17.835 --> 23:21.204
Bats has made it very clear
that I'm on thin ice.

23:21.206 --> 23:22.405
Thomas Kallor.

23:22.407 --> 23:24.808
Ten months ago, I found him
naked, raving.

23:24.810 --> 23:26.509
He was taken to Arkham.

23:26.511 --> 23:27.810
Symptoms?

23:27.812 --> 23:29.979
Delusional,
paranoid schizophrenic.

23:29.981 --> 23:32.082
Partial amnesia, apparently.

23:32.084 --> 23:34.817
He seems to be able to control
the mass of objects.

23:34.819 --> 23:38.221
He could've leveled Arkham,
he's that strong.

23:38.223 --> 23:41.561
He also claims he's from
the 31st century.

23:43.196 --> 23:46.096
Okay, not so delusional.

23:46.098 --> 23:49.132
He did have a strong reaction
to your little scuffle, Clark.

23:49.134 --> 23:51.768
Yes, it's healing slowly, and
I'm in a fair amount of pain.

23:51.770 --> 23:53.037
Thanks for asking.

23:53.039 --> 23:54.938
You said you knew
where he was going.

23:54.940 --> 23:56.439
He said that "they"

23:56.441 --> 23:59.543
were after something
or someone called Limelight.

23:59.545 --> 24:02.246
Limelight... Green Lantern?

24:02.248 --> 24:03.413
Which one?

24:03.415 --> 24:05.382
He also mentioned 21 bridges.

24:05.384 --> 24:07.951
There's more than one city
in the U.S. with that many,

24:07.953 --> 24:10.756
but only one with a resident
Green Lantern.

24:11.357 --> 24:13.158
Portland, Oregon.

24:20.133 --> 24:21.834
She's here somewhere.

24:22.801 --> 24:24.002
Flush her out.

24:33.946 --> 24:36.082
Huh?

24:47.628 --> 24:49.727
<i>We interrupt
with some breaking news.</i>

24:49.729 --> 24:52.329
<i>We're getting reports of
gunfire and multiple explosions</i>

24:52.331 --> 24:54.665
<i>near a food cart park
downtown.</i>

24:54.667 --> 24:57.836
<i>The chaos appears to be the work of
at least three costumed assailants</i>

24:57.838 --> 24:59.271
<i>armed with
high-tech weaponry</i>

24:59.273 --> 25:00.839
- <i>and body armor.</i>
- I can do this.

25:00.841 --> 25:01.839
<i>The attack began just...</i>

25:13.453 --> 25:14.653
What the hell?

25:14.655 --> 25:16.955
That's what insurance is for.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.431
You're coming with us.

25:25.433 --> 25:27.133
If you resist,

25:27.135 --> 25:29.970
my colleague here is called
The Persuader for a reason.

25:32.406 --> 25:33.907
Leave her alone.

25:44.619 --> 25:45.820
Run!

25:57.966 --> 26:01.936
Seems like this era hasn't been
treating you too well, Star Boy.

26:25.160 --> 26:27.526
Who are you?
What the hell is going on?

26:27.528 --> 26:29.028
Star Boy, he just said it.

26:29.030 --> 26:30.497
And you shouldn't have
used your ring.

26:30.499 --> 26:31.964
Why?

26:31.966 --> 26:33.400
When lambs are lost
in the mountain, they cry.

26:33.402 --> 26:35.102
Sometimes come the mother,
sometime the wolf.

26:35.104 --> 26:36.336
Who are the wolves?

26:36.338 --> 26:38.004
- The Five.
- I counted three.

26:38.006 --> 26:40.474
Looks like three.
But it's five. I remember.

26:49.585 --> 26:52.421
Stay put, girl.
There's nowhere to run.

27:03.333 --> 27:06.900
Well, well.
Ye old Justice League.

27:06.902 --> 27:08.703
Where's your friend?

27:08.705 --> 27:10.203
Still licking his wounds?

27:10.205 --> 27:11.838
I don't know
who you are but...

27:11.840 --> 27:12.974
Ah, yes.

27:12.976 --> 27:15.009
The 21st century
pleasantries.

27:15.011 --> 27:16.343
I am Mano,

27:16.345 --> 27:18.845
this is Tharok, and this is...

27:18.847 --> 27:20.517
Dead man walking?

27:55.885 --> 27:57.087
Take her.

28:20.211 --> 28:21.411
Help Persuader.

28:21.413 --> 28:23.414
I'll take care of the others.

28:52.778 --> 28:54.644
I heard you were grabby.

29:40.325 --> 29:44.497
Will power, indeterminate.
Consciousness at nine percent.

30:15.929 --> 30:19.129
<i>Mano. Superman's back.
He's got the girl.</i>

30:19.131 --> 30:20.466
Everyone, regroup.

30:25.239 --> 30:27.373
He's under there.
I can't get near him.

31:10.652 --> 31:11.653
Feeling better?

31:15.623 --> 31:17.523
Look, I don't mean
to be pushy,

31:17.525 --> 31:20.328
but your friends did some
serious damage back there.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.567
So, how do you know them,
and where are they now?

31:29.537 --> 31:31.237
Look, space boy,
I'm the good cop.

31:31.239 --> 31:34.239
Be happy it's me talking to
you and not Batman 'cause he...

31:34.241 --> 31:36.309
Mind if I join you?

31:36.311 --> 31:38.678
It's Star Boy, right?

31:38.680 --> 31:41.048
It's Thomas, really.

31:41.050 --> 31:45.320
Stressful situations like that always
leave me totally starving. You too?

31:49.357 --> 31:51.925
I'm so not eating my pudding.

31:51.927 --> 31:53.027
Do you want it?

31:53.029 --> 31:54.228
Yes.

31:56.799 --> 31:58.264
Mmm. Pudding.

31:58.266 --> 32:00.000
Arkham had pudding
every Thursday.

32:00.002 --> 32:01.134
Everyone loved it.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.469
Especially the clown.

32:02.471 --> 32:03.502
Lot of people
are afraid of clowns.

32:03.504 --> 32:05.441
That's called coulrophobia.

32:06.342 --> 32:08.108
You know what? He's all yours.

32:08.110 --> 32:10.145
I'm getting a mochaccino.

32:12.348 --> 32:15.116
- I'm Jessica, by the way.
- I know.

32:15.818 --> 32:17.085
How do you know me?

32:17.087 --> 32:19.252
Everyone knows Limelight.

32:19.254 --> 32:21.723
I always remembered that,
even in Arkham.

32:21.725 --> 32:23.023
I forgot the Five,

32:23.025 --> 32:24.993
but I remembered you.

32:24.995 --> 32:27.227
You're the key. The key!

32:27.229 --> 32:28.832
What else do you remember?

32:30.132 --> 32:32.599
I remember waking up
in the past,

32:32.601 --> 32:35.637
but now in the present,
quatroclozapine wearing off,

32:35.639 --> 32:36.537
and then...

32:36.539 --> 32:39.073
Television. And pills.

32:39.075 --> 32:41.375
Pills, television, then...

32:41.377 --> 32:43.077
Then, the Five!

32:43.079 --> 32:44.979
They came for you. Ha...

32:44.981 --> 32:47.181
Had to stop them because...

32:47.183 --> 32:48.950
Oh, it's so hard.
I can't think.

32:48.952 --> 32:50.320
I can't remember.

32:54.791 --> 32:58.228
You can't just force your mind to
do something it doesn't want to.

32:59.063 --> 33:01.361
I know.

33:01.363 --> 33:03.299
How would you like to
come back with us?

33:04.067 --> 33:05.833
Yes!

33:05.835 --> 33:09.272
Oh. Thursday is
bingo night at Arkham.

33:10.340 --> 33:11.606
That's okay.

33:11.608 --> 33:13.878
It is at the Watchtower, too.

33:21.451 --> 33:24.119
What the hell are we
supposed to do now?

33:24.121 --> 33:25.654
We stick to the plan.

33:25.656 --> 33:28.624
Oh, right, right.
The perfect plan.

33:28.626 --> 33:30.558
Going just like clockwork,
isn't it?

33:30.560 --> 33:34.563
Except we were stuck in that time
trap and that boy's still on us.

33:34.565 --> 33:39.101
How do we know he isn't telling the
Justice League our plan right now?

33:39.103 --> 33:40.836
It changes nothing.

33:40.838 --> 33:42.371
We will retrieve the key.

33:42.373 --> 33:43.939
Then we will free them.

33:43.941 --> 33:46.475
We're going to a lot of trouble
to free your girlfriend.

33:46.477 --> 33:48.343
Who you can't even touch.

33:48.345 --> 33:49.611
How does that work anyway?

33:49.613 --> 33:51.380
Do you keep it in the sack?

33:58.122 --> 34:00.257
No! No, please!

34:04.295 --> 34:05.995
On second thought,

34:05.997 --> 34:07.998
can you still do that trick?

34:08.766 --> 34:09.899
What trick?

34:09.901 --> 34:11.635
Where you
make the bombs.

34:12.704 --> 34:14.238
Yeah. Sure.

34:17.508 --> 34:19.443
When the prey
goes to ground,

34:20.178 --> 34:21.847
smoke them out.

34:36.527 --> 34:39.129
I intercepted a transmission
I can't identify.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.501
- The cyborg?
- That'd be my guess.

34:44.503 --> 34:47.670
The Watchtower.
I have the play set for this.

34:47.672 --> 34:51.008
It's an antique. I keep it
in my room at the clubhouse.

34:51.010 --> 34:52.576
What clubhouse?

34:52.578 --> 34:54.714
I told you,
I'm a superhero.

35:00.418 --> 35:02.653
We need to know what he knows.

35:02.655 --> 35:04.288
He doesn't even know
what he knows.

35:04.290 --> 35:06.589
Nothing he says
ever makes sense.

35:06.591 --> 35:09.292
You'll have to take us
inside his head.

35:09.294 --> 35:10.361
Us?

35:10.363 --> 35:12.429
You, me and Jessica.

35:12.431 --> 35:14.298
Listen, two brains
are company,

35:14.300 --> 35:15.699
three is a crowd,

35:15.701 --> 35:17.935
and four is a party
I don't even wanna go to.

35:17.937 --> 35:19.939
She's a calming influence.

35:20.907 --> 35:21.909
We need her.

35:31.551 --> 35:34.218
So, I'm starting to
get nervous now.

35:34.220 --> 35:35.653
I hate the dentist.

35:35.655 --> 35:37.991
It's okay. I'm right here.

35:39.193 --> 35:40.761
Think about home.

35:41.228 --> 35:43.028
Home?

35:43.030 --> 35:45.832
Yes, Thomas.
Show us your home.

36:03.083 --> 36:04.448
Flying cars.

36:04.450 --> 36:06.985
I guess the movies
got some things right.

36:06.987 --> 36:07.988
Where's Thomas?

36:10.058 --> 36:11.891
He's here.

36:11.893 --> 36:14.528
There's something stopping us
from connecting to his ego.

36:15.495 --> 36:16.830
He's scared.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.035
His med kit.

36:23.503 --> 36:25.037
Clearly, this is what
allows him to maintain

36:25.039 --> 36:27.773
his mental stability
in his time.

36:27.775 --> 36:29.644
Too bad we can't
take it with us.

36:30.745 --> 36:33.678
Girlfriend. Hmm. Pretty.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.647
We don't know
that's his girlfriend.

36:35.649 --> 36:36.918
Could be his cousin.

36:39.754 --> 36:42.621
Thomas. Where are you?

36:42.623 --> 36:44.491
We need to talk to you.

36:59.975 --> 37:02.241
<i>Welcome to the Legion Museum.</i>

37:02.243 --> 37:06.179
<i>Chronicling the post-scarcity
utopia ushered in by</i>

37:06.181 --> 37:08.582
<i>The Legion of Superheroes.</i>

37:08.584 --> 37:10.783
<i>Young people from
across the stars</i>

37:10.785 --> 37:15.024
<i>dedicated to defending the principles
and ideals of the United Planets.</i>

37:16.392 --> 37:17.593
Look.

37:18.327 --> 37:19.627
Star Boy.

37:23.165 --> 37:25.032
They're teenagers,

37:25.034 --> 37:26.367
all of them.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.037
It's like your
worst nightmare.

37:33.842 --> 37:35.709
<i>To understand their heritage,</i>

37:35.711 --> 37:37.713
<i>we begin eons ago.</i>

37:39.181 --> 37:40.647
<i>The Justice League,</i>

37:40.649 --> 37:42.883
<i>champions of Earth
in the 21st century.</i>

37:42.885 --> 37:45.652
<i>Today, their exploits
and ideology</i>

37:45.654 --> 37:48.091
<i>are the guiding principles
of the Legion.</i>

37:50.427 --> 37:52.661
Hey, look. There I am
in the back.

37:53.729 --> 37:55.597
Looks like I made it!

37:57.534 --> 37:59.001
Where are you, Bats?

38:03.173 --> 38:04.774
Nothing like me.

38:12.215 --> 38:14.282
<i>Included
in the Justice League ranks</i>

38:14.284 --> 38:17.318
<i>were the members of the
legendary Green Lantern Corps,</i>

38:17.320 --> 38:19.354
<i>now lost to the ages.</i>

38:19.356 --> 38:20.722
What?

38:20.724 --> 38:22.625
What's that supposed to...

38:24.594 --> 38:26.030
Holy crap.

38:31.501 --> 38:32.900
Forget about this.

38:32.902 --> 38:35.437
Ask him about Mano,
Tharok and The Persuader.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.508
I think he heard you.

38:40.710 --> 38:42.779
Thomas! What's wrong?

39:27.124 --> 39:29.492
Are we
supposed to be helping?

39:29.494 --> 39:31.730
We can't.
This is only a memory.

40:36.229 --> 40:37.394
He said there were five.

40:37.396 --> 40:39.366
Looks like we found
the missing two.

40:57.117 --> 40:59.784
I told you I was a superhero.

40:59.786 --> 41:02.920
How dare you impair
the Eye of Ekron?

41:36.391 --> 41:37.392
Empress!

41:42.729 --> 41:43.931
Come on, we gotta go.

41:50.037 --> 41:51.404
You're not very smart,

41:51.406 --> 41:53.738
if you think I won't
be back, Brain Boy.

41:53.740 --> 41:54.941
You have nothing.

41:54.943 --> 41:57.210
Nothing that can hold me!

41:57.212 --> 41:58.678
She's right.

41:58.680 --> 42:01.447
Not even the prison on
Takron-Galtos is strong enough.

42:01.449 --> 42:03.082
She's half right.

42:03.084 --> 42:05.787
There's nothing strong enough
to hold them in this time.

42:08.789 --> 42:10.256
What're you doing?

42:10.258 --> 42:12.325
Increasing the mass,
making the steel stronger.

42:12.327 --> 42:14.860
What about your meds?
Did you take them?

42:14.862 --> 42:16.761
I will.

42:16.763 --> 42:18.664
Thomas, look at me.
Look at me.

42:18.666 --> 42:21.801
You miss only a couple of doses,
and it won't work anymore.

42:21.803 --> 42:23.270
You'll get worse.

42:23.272 --> 42:24.870
You'll never be able to
think straight again.

42:24.872 --> 42:26.874
You won't be in the Legion.

42:28.876 --> 42:30.379
That true?

42:31.746 --> 42:33.012
I forgot!

42:33.014 --> 42:34.214
I tried to find my medicine.

42:34.216 --> 42:36.415
It wasn't here.
It doesn't exist.

42:38.253 --> 42:40.287
We're losing the connection.

42:40.289 --> 42:42.055
Thomas, please.

42:42.057 --> 42:44.491
Never forget, never forget!
Never forget!

42:44.493 --> 42:46.792
Stupid! Stupid!

42:46.794 --> 42:48.027
Can you do anything?

42:48.029 --> 42:49.296
We're in the middle
of his mind.

42:49.298 --> 42:51.365
It's not like pressing pause.

42:51.367 --> 42:53.936
<i>Batman.
Batman! Wake up!</i>

42:58.374 --> 43:01.408
We just got a message
from the Fatal Five.

43:01.410 --> 43:03.678
<i>Do not take
this threat lightly.</i>

43:03.680 --> 43:07.281
<i>Metropolis will be but the first
of your cities to be flattened.</i>

43:07.283 --> 43:09.950
<i>Then the others, one by one,</i>

43:09.952 --> 43:13.988
<i>and in a synchronization of
destruction you never dreamed possible.</i>

43:13.990 --> 43:17.391
<i>Or simply hand over
the Lantern.</i>

43:17.393 --> 43:20.261
<i>We promise no harm
will come to her.</i>

43:20.263 --> 43:22.697
<i>We only need her assistance.</i>

43:22.699 --> 43:24.264
<i>Decide quickly.</i>

43:24.266 --> 43:27.236
<i>The cost of hesitation
is the blood of innocents.</i>

43:28.305 --> 43:30.004
That's where the message ends.

43:30.006 --> 43:32.708
There's no way
to trace the signal.

43:32.710 --> 43:33.907
So what's our play?

43:33.909 --> 43:35.876
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

43:35.878 --> 43:38.346
Even the 31st century kind.

43:38.348 --> 43:40.214
- Agreed.
- Hey.

43:40.216 --> 43:42.685
I'm picking up that energy
frequency I found earlier.

43:42.687 --> 43:43.919
Multiple signals.

43:45.155 --> 43:47.524
My guess is
they connect to Tharok.

43:48.825 --> 43:50.894
These are receiving
transmissions.

44:03.440 --> 44:04.441
They're bombs!

44:21.125 --> 44:22.926
I've got this! Go!

44:24.195 --> 44:25.893
I should do something.

44:25.895 --> 44:27.930
You're the one they're after.
Stay here.

44:27.932 --> 44:29.532
Both of you.

44:29.534 --> 44:31.134
But I'm a superhero.

44:32.102 --> 44:34.438
I am. You saw.

45:46.512 --> 45:48.646
Are you all right?

45:48.648 --> 45:49.946
No, I'm not all right.

45:49.948 --> 45:51.882
Nothing about this
is all right,

45:51.884 --> 45:55.121
and you'd understand that if you
weren't even more messed up than I am!

45:58.758 --> 46:00.558
I'm sorry.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.026
It's just that...

46:02.028 --> 46:03.696
I don't know what to do.

46:05.264 --> 46:07.197
I know what I'd like to do,

46:07.199 --> 46:09.099
get the hell out of here.

46:09.101 --> 46:10.968
The scary guy should
let you help.

46:10.970 --> 46:12.838
You're Limelight.
You're the bravest.

46:12.840 --> 46:14.340
Just stop!

46:15.676 --> 46:17.274
I'm not the bravest.

46:17.276 --> 46:20.311
Most days, I'm scared
to put this ring on,

46:20.313 --> 46:22.379
scared to get out of bed...

46:23.650 --> 46:25.116
What? What is it?

46:25.118 --> 46:27.819
<i>I'm on a frequency
generated by your ring.</i>

46:27.821 --> 46:30.022
<i>Only a Lantern can hear it.</i>

46:31.692 --> 46:33.494
Can you give me a minute?

46:34.828 --> 46:36.462
Uh, sure.

46:38.966 --> 46:40.866
Tharok. What do you want?

46:40.868 --> 46:44.302
<i>You're a smart girl.
You know we're not bluffing.</i>

46:44.304 --> 46:47.238
<i>How many need to die,
Jessica Cruz?</i>

46:47.240 --> 46:50.075
<i>You have the power
to stop this.</i>

46:50.077 --> 46:51.676
<i>Follow this signal.</i>

46:51.678 --> 46:53.013
<i>Come alone.</i>

47:14.167 --> 47:15.333
I'm here.

47:15.335 --> 47:17.102
That was quick.

47:17.104 --> 47:19.405
Maybe I should be called
The Persuader.

47:19.407 --> 47:21.908
You've made
a brave choice, girl.

47:21.910 --> 47:24.109
Yeah. Real brave.

47:24.111 --> 47:25.410
I just surrendered.

47:25.412 --> 47:27.245
You bought life
for your city.

47:27.247 --> 47:29.115
You care about your people,

47:29.117 --> 47:31.152
as I care about mine.

47:32.320 --> 47:33.753
What do you want?

47:33.755 --> 47:35.688
We're going on
a little road trip.

47:35.690 --> 47:37.225
See some friends.

47:37.926 --> 47:40.061
And if I don't go along?

47:46.267 --> 47:48.234
No! Stop it! I'll do it.

47:48.236 --> 47:50.138
I'll take you wherever
you want!

48:20.770 --> 48:21.835
Oa.

48:21.837 --> 48:23.202
Of Course.

48:23.204 --> 48:25.005
Who else but the fabled
Green Lantern Corps

48:25.007 --> 48:28.710
could hope to hold the two
mightiest beings in the galaxy?

48:28.712 --> 48:29.877
It won't work.

48:29.879 --> 48:31.110
They'll stop you.

48:31.112 --> 48:32.479
I hope they try.

48:32.481 --> 48:35.248
They're nothing but a legend
in our time.

48:35.250 --> 48:37.552
Perhaps I'm the one
who ended them.

48:37.554 --> 48:39.821
Sadly, you will not
have that chance.

48:39.823 --> 48:41.521
Most of
the Green Fascist Corps

48:41.523 --> 48:44.191
are currently fighting some
obscure war on Rann.

48:44.193 --> 48:49.263
Their interplanetary Gulag
is currently... Understaffed.

48:49.265 --> 48:50.430
It doesn't matter.

48:50.432 --> 48:52.332
The Sciencells
are impenetrable.

48:52.334 --> 48:53.803
There's no way to...

48:55.105 --> 48:56.306
Shit.

48:57.007 --> 48:58.341
I'm the key.

49:00.209 --> 49:03.845
<i>Green
Lantern Jessica Cruz of Sector 2814.</i>

49:03.847 --> 49:06.449
<i>This is
an unscheduled approach.</i>

49:13.590 --> 49:16.125
I have prisoners bound
for the Sciencells.

49:16.127 --> 49:18.192
All good. Situation green.

49:18.194 --> 49:20.597
<i>Please proceed
to the detention compound.</i>

50:24.563 --> 50:26.932
Say it
just as I told you.

50:34.506 --> 50:37.374
Sarya, Empress of Venegar.

50:37.876 --> 50:39.310
Validus.

50:58.131 --> 50:59.331
Open it.

51:26.324 --> 51:29.028
And now for my Empress.

51:42.975 --> 51:44.041
Child's play.

51:44.043 --> 51:45.442
You wanna play?

51:45.444 --> 51:47.779
Play with this!

51:50.083 --> 51:52.817
Situation green.
Lantern under duress.

51:52.819 --> 51:54.385
Glad you did
your homework, kid.

51:54.387 --> 51:55.519
You all right?

51:55.521 --> 51:56.990
I'm not that you're...

52:10.504 --> 52:12.605
Come on. Re-lock. Re-lock!

52:15.442 --> 52:16.942
Stand down!

52:16.944 --> 52:18.911
You are under arrest by
the Green Lantern Corps

52:18.913 --> 52:21.412
for abetting
an escape attempt by...

52:21.414 --> 52:22.616
Fart nuggets.

52:53.681 --> 52:56.316
Get back in there,
you ugly poozer!

53:01.756 --> 53:02.824
Kilowog!

53:19.375 --> 53:20.875
You bastards!

53:41.997 --> 53:45.567
So much for the legendary
Jessica Cruz.

54:25.276 --> 54:28.508
The central power battery.

54:28.510 --> 54:30.912
Considerate of the Legion,
wasn't it?

54:30.914 --> 54:37.484
To deliver me to the single most
concentrated source of power in the galaxy.

54:37.486 --> 54:40.557
Take it. The energy is yours.

55:00.111 --> 55:02.113
Well, that's the last
of the bombs.

55:13.723 --> 55:15.290
That ends that.

55:15.292 --> 55:16.859
<i>Not quite.</i>

55:16.861 --> 55:18.529
<i>We have a problem.</i>

55:19.897 --> 55:21.630
I'm telling you, she's gone.

55:21.632 --> 55:23.165
She is gone.
I don't know where.

55:23.167 --> 55:24.700
It was empty,
the whole building!

55:24.702 --> 55:26.902
Calm down, Star Boy. Focus.

55:26.904 --> 55:29.439
I searched. Even the closets,
they're empty.

55:29.441 --> 55:30.639
She's not there!

55:30.641 --> 55:31.941
They have Jessica.

55:31.943 --> 55:33.275
What will they do now?

55:33.277 --> 55:34.311
Their time machine,

55:35.079 --> 55:36.712
where is it?

55:36.714 --> 55:38.616
Some place safe.

55:52.431 --> 55:53.931
Sorry, we're closed.

56:01.872 --> 56:03.108
Hands up!

56:05.844 --> 56:07.946
Take me to it, Tharok.

57:10.743 --> 57:14.645
I've had time to think while
you left me languishing, love.

57:14.647 --> 57:20.318
And it occurs to me that we can stop
our enemies before they even start.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.888
All we need to do is...

57:22.589 --> 57:25.025
Destroy their sun.

57:25.759 --> 57:27.227
You're kidding.

57:28.362 --> 57:30.661
She's kidding, right?

57:30.663 --> 57:34.733
Think of all the heroes
this planet alone has spawned.

57:34.735 --> 57:36.369
We destroy this sun,

57:36.371 --> 57:38.336
we destroy it all.

57:38.338 --> 57:40.172
The League, the Martians,

57:40.174 --> 57:43.008
the Legion,
the United Planets.

57:43.010 --> 57:47.379
We return to our time with
virtually no one to oppose us.

57:47.381 --> 57:49.716
And how exactly
do we do this?

57:50.150 --> 57:51.384
The Eye.

57:51.386 --> 57:54.420
It contains all the power
of the Lanterns' battery.

57:54.422 --> 57:56.322
It's seething with it.

57:56.324 --> 58:00.225
It will rip
that infernal star apart.

58:00.227 --> 58:01.893
<i>Mano.</i>

58:01.895 --> 58:03.364
It's them again.

58:09.537 --> 58:12.740
No one's responding
to our call. I don't like it.

58:57.720 --> 58:59.321
- I can stop...
- Stay here.

59:22.345 --> 59:24.046
Get us inside.

59:44.066 --> 59:45.132
We're open for business.

1:00:09.025 --> 1:00:10.394
I got this one.

1:00:14.598 --> 1:00:17.433
Ah. Batman, is it?

1:00:17.435 --> 1:00:20.968
I think I will
disintegrate you slowly.

1:00:20.970 --> 1:00:22.972
Bring it, Skeletor.

1:00:37.656 --> 1:00:39.221
Kilowog!

1:00:39.223 --> 1:00:40.656
Wake up.

1:00:40.658 --> 1:00:42.358
Call the others.

1:01:10.522 --> 1:01:11.889
In brightest day,

1:01:12.957 --> 1:01:14.459
in blackest night,

1:01:16.962 --> 1:01:20.197
no evil shall escape my sight.

1:01:22.434 --> 1:01:25.470
Let those who worship
evil's might

1:01:27.539 --> 1:01:29.140
beware my power,

1:01:29.907 --> 1:01:31.543
Green Lantern's light!

1:01:53.098 --> 1:01:54.799
Take...

1:01:54.801 --> 1:01:56.701
Take me home.

1:03:06.373 --> 1:03:07.272
Whoa.

1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:13.780
You okay?

1:03:14.948 --> 1:03:16.316
Broke a nail.

1:03:49.217 --> 1:03:50.884
I can't move my arm!

1:03:50.886 --> 1:03:53.686
Pressure points.
You might not be human,

1:03:53.688 --> 1:03:54.854
but you fall like one.

1:04:01.262 --> 1:04:03.298
You are scary.

1:04:15.109 --> 1:04:17.311
Where's Jessica Cruz?

1:04:17.313 --> 1:04:20.313
You mean,
what's left of her?

1:04:20.315 --> 1:04:23.519
I imagine the body
is quite cold by now.

1:04:23.953 --> 1:04:25.153
No.

1:04:57.087 --> 1:05:00.320
There's a continuous charge
coursing through them.

1:05:00.322 --> 1:05:01.789
It mocks Kryptonite energy,

1:05:01.791 --> 1:05:06.661
so even the so-called
Man of Steel is helpless.

1:05:06.663 --> 1:05:10.197
Now to finish them and all the
centuries of would-be heroes

1:05:10.199 --> 1:05:13.236
spawned by this vile
star system.

1:05:40.230 --> 1:05:41.897
In three more minutes,

1:05:41.899 --> 1:05:43.668
their history stops,

1:05:44.267 --> 1:05:45.836
ours begins.

1:06:20.839 --> 1:06:21.907
Limelight.

1:06:25.142 --> 1:06:26.677
Stop her, Validus!

1:06:41.626 --> 1:06:44.228
Idiot! You've doomed us all!

1:07:56.003 --> 1:07:57.370
My Empress!

1:08:45.019 --> 1:08:46.553
I hope it's not too late.

1:08:51.259 --> 1:08:52.524
Take me.

1:08:52.526 --> 1:08:54.126
Why? What can you...

1:08:54.128 --> 1:08:55.294
Star Boy.

1:08:55.296 --> 1:08:56.395
Star...

1:08:56.397 --> 1:08:57.799
Boy.

1:08:58.665 --> 1:09:00.565
Thomas, Superman...

1:09:00.567 --> 1:09:02.400
Can't do this.

1:09:02.402 --> 1:09:03.838
I can.

1:09:53.356 --> 1:09:55.022
No! Superman!

1:09:59.328 --> 1:10:00.827
Uh, a construct.

1:10:00.829 --> 1:10:02.330
Something to hold it together.

1:10:02.332 --> 1:10:04.464
It'd take a thousand Lanterns.

1:10:04.466 --> 1:10:06.667
And it can't be
pushed back together.

1:10:06.669 --> 1:10:08.302
It has to be pulled.

1:10:08.304 --> 1:10:10.704
Held together.

1:10:10.706 --> 1:10:12.108
What are you saying?

1:10:13.442 --> 1:10:14.644
Goodbye.

1:10:18.447 --> 1:10:20.315
No!

1:10:20.317 --> 1:10:22.317
Not like this!

1:10:22.319 --> 1:10:23.551
Stop it!

1:10:23.553 --> 1:10:25.552
Don't you see, Limelight?

1:10:25.554 --> 1:10:27.489
I'm the only one
who can do this.

1:10:28.358 --> 1:10:30.325
Thomas!

1:10:30.327 --> 1:10:31.761
It's Star Boy.

1:10:32.963 --> 1:10:34.630
I'm a superhero.

1:12:03.654 --> 1:12:05.155
Martin Luther King said,

1:12:05.157 --> 1:12:08.526
"Only in darkness
can you see the stars."

1:12:08.528 --> 1:12:10.193
And that's kind of true.

1:12:10.195 --> 1:12:13.331
For all the stars,
except one.

1:12:16.168 --> 1:12:19.170
I think none of us will be
able to look at the sun again

1:12:19.172 --> 1:12:22.238
without thinking about
what Thomas did for us.

1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:23.575
For all of us.

1:12:24.643 --> 1:12:27.677
But he did even more for me.

1:12:27.679 --> 1:12:30.816
He told me I was brave
until I believed it.

1:12:32.552 --> 1:12:34.220
No offense to anyone here,

1:12:35.955 --> 1:12:38.024
but Star Boy is my hero.

1:13:32.812 --> 1:13:34.179
Don't stare.

1:13:34.181 --> 1:13:36.981
You're going to see
a lot of strange things.

1:13:36.983 --> 1:13:39.317
Now that you're a part
of the Justice League.

1:13:39.319 --> 1:13:40.320
Oh, I know.

1:13:41.188 --> 1:13:42.454
Wait, what?

1:13:42.456 --> 1:13:44.256
We voted.

1:13:44.258 --> 1:13:47.259
You're a full-time member,
if you still want it.

1:13:47.261 --> 1:13:49.361
Hell, yes, I do!

1:13:49.363 --> 1:13:50.797
And thanks.

1:13:52.433 --> 1:13:55.568
I didn't say how I voted.

1:13:55.570 --> 1:13:57.670
I'm so glad
you all could come.

1:13:59.473 --> 1:14:01.108
You were so important to him.

1:14:02.210 --> 1:14:03.877
Jessica Cruz.

1:14:04.745 --> 1:14:06.113
It's an honor.
