01:04.325 --> 01:06.325
There is a concert.

01:08.825 --> 01:10.417
Why do you have
to entertain them

01:10.492 --> 01:12.787
to get them to listen?

01:14.991 --> 01:16.583
It's just good to remind them

01:16.658 --> 01:19.625
what else human nature
is capable of.

01:23.658 --> 01:25.829
You should come.

01:27.117 --> 01:29.617
Come with me.

01:36.117 --> 01:37.163
I don't have to.

01:37.242 --> 01:41.788
I just read
your beautiful speech.

03:05.991 --> 03:09.117
<i>Especially when
he would take me with him...</i>

03:09.492 --> 03:12.788
<i>I cherished the days
with my father.</i>

03:20.950 --> 03:23.167
<i>It has been said
that only death can keep</i>

03:23.242 --> 03:25.833
<i>a father from his daughter.</i>

03:27.033 --> 03:29.409
<i>Until my own father
died at 80...</i>

03:30.574 --> 03:33.791
<i>it was life, saving a life,</i>

03:34.117 --> 03:36.334
<i>that kept us apart.</i>

03:39.700 --> 03:41.326
<i>Growing up, every day</i>

03:41.409 --> 03:44.455
<i>I thought about
what I was going to be,</i>

03:44.950 --> 03:46.746
<i>where I would leave my mark,</i>

03:47.075 --> 03:48.916
<i>how I would...</i>

03:49.325 --> 03:52.451
<i>save the world.</i>

04:28.741 --> 04:30.537
<i>Before I met Miguel,</i>

04:31.200 --> 04:33.575
<i>I was an idea I had.</i>

04:38.491 --> 04:41.208
<i>I didn't really exist.</i>

05:28.033 --> 05:29.658
Special UN representative,

05:30.033 --> 05:31.954
and the daughter
of MDM co-founder,

05:32.033 --> 05:33.624
Dr. Peter Petersen,

05:33.866 --> 05:37.083
please welcome
Dr. Wren Petersen.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.326
<i>Bronte once wrote...</i>

05:43.950 --> 05:50.168
<i>"I could not, in those days,
see Gad for His creature.“</i>

06:33.283 --> 06:34.578
Open. open, open!

07:14.033 --> 07:18.329
Come on! Come on!
Get him, get him, faster!

07:18.741 --> 07:22.367
Faster, get him fast.
Prep for trauma.

07:22.449 --> 07:25.416
Prep for trauma, table four.
Table four.

09:50.700 --> 09:53.371
Okay, everybody, focus.
Focus,

10:15.491 --> 10:16.992
Dress it.

11:03.741 --> 11:07.037
Food. Shelter.

11:09.491 --> 11:12.958
Security.
We all need safety.

11:15.825 --> 11:18.746
Show of hands,
who believe the bowl is full.

11:25.491 --> 11:29.287
How quickly you change
your story, eh? Hmm'?

11:30.991 --> 11:33.457
Who believes it's full'?

11:33.991 --> 11:36.411
Definitely? Definitely.

11:36.491 --> 11:38.207
I hear "definitely."

11:39.616 --> 11:42.412
Aww!

11:42.616 --> 11:44.912
I did not see that coming.

11:45.282 --> 11:47.328
See'? Look at that.

11:49.157 --> 11:50.783
What does this tell you?

11:51.032 --> 11:52.408
I know. I know, I know.

11:52.491 --> 11:53.582
Mm-hmm?

11:54.491 --> 11:57.833
There is always room
for more in the glass.

11:58.408 --> 12:01.579
He always gets
the answers, right'? Yes.

12:01.990 --> 12:03.990
I can tell.

12:07.825 --> 12:12.826
I think it means if we don't put
our big rocks in first,

12:12.908 --> 12:15.203
they'll never fit.

13:05.658 --> 13:07.550
<i>First time
the U.N. ever lei refugees</i>

13:07.574 --> 13:09.324
inside a base... It's packed.

13:09.408 --> 13:10.550
<i>Everybody outside of the base</i>

13:10.574 --> 13:12.370
<i>is getting whacked
by the opposition.</i>

13:12.449 --> 13:15.165
<i>Copy that.

<i>Approach LZ from north. Over.</i>

13:33.074 --> 13:35.040
Copy on that.
I see your smoke.

14:32.241 --> 14:33.537
I'm Mahmoud Idris.

14:33.616 --> 14:34.957
Dr. Miguel Leon'

14:37.700 --> 14:39.700
I'm the guy that brought him
his Chili Pepper CDs

14:39.783 --> 14:41.704
into Juba last year.

14:45.616 --> 14:48.366
Take the baby with you, please.
Take the baby with you, please.

14:48.783 --> 14:50.841
Take the baby with you, please.
We're not going to Juba.

14:50.865 --> 14:52.036
We're going to someplace bad.

14:52.116 --> 14:53.458
Take that baby.

14:53.533 --> 14:55.634
The trip last year, I brought you
the Chili Peppers CDs.

14:55.658 --> 14:57.579
- I'm that guy.
- Let's get out of here.

14:57.990 --> 14:59.707
All right.
Moving time!

16:42.449 --> 16:43.744
Look at that shit.

16:43.824 --> 16:45.621
They fucking burned them
to death.

16:45.699 --> 16:49.371
This is why I smoke weed.
Mary Jane.

17:09.990 --> 17:12.082
This person has a gunshot
in the abdomen.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.203
Is that the daughter?

17:13.491 --> 17:16.287
Put her in a line
and start drawing her blood.

17:45.782 --> 17:48.374
- Wren! They've already started.
- That's all right.

17:48.449 --> 17:50.370
This meeting is a distraction
we don't need.

17:50.449 --> 17:51.370
Make sure I have

17:51.449 --> 17:52.883
all the East Africa
assessments right after.

17:52.907 --> 17:55.283
Increase in access
to anti-retroviral drugs

17:55.366 --> 17:56.866
by eight million.

17:56.949 --> 17:59.790
Eight sub-Saharan countries
where malaria deaths

17:59.865 --> 18:01.332
have been cut by 75%.

18:01.408 --> 18:02.454
I know, I know.

18:02.533 --> 18:04.999
Child mortality rates, health
education, education for girls,

18:05.074 --> 18:06.874
improving peacekeeping
missions... I can read.

18:06.949 --> 18:10.496
Wren, everyone,
we're in a budget crisis,

18:10.740 --> 18:13.707
and under attack
by a world of impatient,

18:13.782 --> 18:16.329
non-solution-oriented critics.

18:17.074 --> 18:20.075
Just get a few
“good news" stories out there.

18:20.865 --> 18:24.082
Is our mission serious enough

18:24.157 --> 18:26.203
that we can be forthcoming
with its failings

18:26.282 --> 18:28.123
alongside its boasts?

18:28.740 --> 18:32.957
Wren, do you not see our mission
as a serious one?

18:33.116 --> 18:34.367
Of course I do, Ivan.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.157
Saving lives
is a serious mission.

18:37.574 --> 18:38.495
For that matter,

18:38.574 --> 18:43.450
every single human interaction
that changes things is.

18:43.782 --> 18:45.623
- Ivan...
- No, I'm not finished.

18:47.282 --> 18:50.999
I'm sorry, but every time

18:51.907 --> 18:54.124
we release statements like these.

18:54.449 --> 18:57.120
We lose all credibility.

18:57.907 --> 18:59.782
<i>Just...</i>

19:02.074 --> 19:03.995
Can we be as honest
with the media

19:04.074 --> 19:05.416
as I believe most of us

19:05.491 --> 19:07.786
in this room are with ourselves?

19:07.865 --> 19:08.865
That's it.

19:12.032 --> 19:14.124
Ivan. how about this...

19:14.491 --> 19:16.537
Wren sits down
and writes another draft

19:16.782 --> 19:18.748
that accomplishes
exactly what she's saying?

19:18.824 --> 19:21.245
And we'll join in a touch

19:21.324 --> 19:23.450
of that self-flagellation
with her?

19:23.573 --> 19:26.415
Good by you, Wren?

19:27.949 --> 19:28.949
Yes.

19:36.282 --> 19:37.827
Doctor, he's exsanguinating.

19:55.782 --> 19:57.408
It is not your fault.

20:09.699 --> 20:10.699
She has already lost

20:10.740 --> 20:12.457
her mother and sister
in the raids.

20:16.490 --> 20:20.957
Can I take it?
Can Hake it?

20:27.408 --> 20:29.454
Shall I inform the girl, Doctor?

20:30.907 --> 20:33.328
Let Dr. Miguel
inform her in the morning.

Evening.

21:12.907 --> 21:15.328
You know that girl
I was dancing with?

21:16.699 --> 21:19.870
She watched her sister
get raped until she died.

21:20.282 --> 21:21.452
Okay.

21:21.824 --> 21:23.824
She was raped also.

21:24.199 --> 21:28.166
I mean, they ripped her
from her vagina to her anus.

21:28.532 --> 21:34.034
But, I mean, she's here dancing...
with me,

21:34.573 --> 21:40.041
I mean, she leaks urine,
but she's dancing.

21:40.116 --> 21:43.367
I mean, she's... she's beautiful.

21:51.116 --> 21:52.957
Peace.

22:15.074 --> 22:17.540
It's another attack!
They're going for the food!

22:17.990 --> 22:20.410
Stop shooting!
Stop shooting!

22:28.448 --> 22:29.664
Why are they doing this?

22:29.740 --> 22:31.615
Stay here.
Don't move.

22:31.699 --> 22:34.120
Baba el?

22:34.199 --> 22:36.699
Your father... Oh, God!
Your father, I know, I know.

22:36.782 --> 22:38.578
Stay down, lay flat.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.623
Father...

22:49.782 --> 22:50.873
Father...

23:08.074 --> 23:09.699
They're going after my machine!

23:09.949 --> 23:11.449
Fuck that noise!

23:19.074 --> 23:20.915
You motherfuckers!

24:03.032 --> 24:06.953
I'll think of you.
You were here.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.786
Your family was here.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.536
I'll remember.

24:14.407 --> 24:15.828
Fuck!

25:44.032 --> 25:45.748
<i>Pardon. Un doble espresso?</i>

25:46.573 --> 25:48.074
<i>Si! vous plait.</i>

25:57.365 --> 25:58.957
<i>Un</i> por...

26:05.657 --> 26:07.282
<i>Merci.</i>

26:54.365 --> 26:56.161
Some messages.

26:56.407 --> 26:59.033
The Cape Town flight
is all set for next week.

26:59.490 --> 27:01.741
Mandy at MDM said

27:01.824 --> 27:03.324
that everybody there
is very excited

27:03.407 --> 27:04.407
that you're coming.

27:04.699 --> 27:08.791
Uh... do you want to return
to Geneva immediately

27:08.865 --> 27:09.865
after the event...

27:10.448 --> 27:12.073
or the next day?

27:24.240 --> 27:25.411
You Okay?

27:28.407 --> 27:30.282
Check on flights
to Cape Town for tomorrow.

27:30.407 --> 27:31.908
I want to get
on the next available.

27:32.907 --> 27:34.532
Okey-dokey.

27:41.824 --> 27:43.574
Open or closed?

27:45.699 --> 27:46.699
Okay.

27:49.782 --> 27:51.748
I'll take whatever victory
I can get.

27:52.073 --> 27:53.699
<i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

27:54.073 --> 27:56.290
<i>They refunded us
for next week's flight.</i>

27:56.365 --> 27:59.115
<i>Bumped it up to tomorrow night.</i>

27:59.407 --> 28:02.954
<i>Can I ask why you're leaving
so far in advance?</i>

28:07.073 --> 28:08.324
Okey-dokey.

28:08.949 --> 28:13.290
I'll just trust you on that one,
and I'll hold the fort here.

28:13.824 --> 28:16.199
You're an angel.
Good night.

28:16.448 --> 28:17.664
<i>Night.</i>

29:05.281 --> 29:06.623
<i>Wren?</i>

29:08.365 --> 29:09.581
<i>Wren.</i>

29:10.198 --> 29:12.699
<i>I'm leaving tomorrow morning.</i>

29:14.365 --> 29:16.616
<i>I wrote you a letter.</i>

29:48.615 --> 29:52.956
<i>After my father's death,
I became his genetic surrogate.</i>

29:53.657 --> 29:55.749
<i>Natural disaster zones
had permitted me</i>

29:55.824 --> 29:57.620
<i>rare visitations with him.</i>

29:58.532 --> 30:01.328
<i>The war zones
he forbade me in his life</i>

30:01.989 --> 30:05.411
<i>were my inheritance
upon his death.</i>

30:07.699 --> 30:10.040
Put your weapons away...

30:10.281 --> 30:11.633
- Are you Dr. Petersen?
- Yes.

30:11.657 --> 30:13.157
Around the side entrance
is my office.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.536
I'll meet you there.
I'm sorry!

30:14.615 --> 30:16.286
Let's go. Come on!

30:21.865 --> 30:25.365
Replacing fluids too quickly
causes heart failure.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.716
- I know. I know.
- Right?

30:26.740 --> 30:28.331
Okay.
Are you a volunteer?

30:28.407 --> 30:29.658
<i>I was invisible.</i>

30:29.740 --> 30:31.160
Take responsibility.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.866
<i>Only the daughter
of their inspiration,</i>

30:34.948 --> 30:37.119
<i>less than invisible...</i>

30:38.156 --> 30:39.247
<i>a tourist.</i>

30:39.740 --> 30:40.955
Ellen, come here.

30:42.948 --> 30:43.948
Ellen...

30:47.740 --> 30:50.240
<i>Sometimes a face is an illusion.</i>

30:50.532 --> 30:52.373
You are the supervisor...

30:52.448 --> 30:54.448
<i>His instantly struck me...</i>

30:54.532 --> 30:57.703
<i>as that of the male child
I'd been hoped to be...</i>

30:57.782 --> 30:58.623
your Paris nightclubs

30:58.699 --> 31:01.620
and listen to that stupid
fucking house music.

31:01.782 --> 31:04.373
<i>Instead of an invisible...</i>

31:05.365 --> 31:09.911
<i>blonde... girl.</i>

31:11.365 --> 31:13.536
<i>Then I was seen.</i>

31:15.281 --> 31:17.498
Surprise.
- Wren!

31:20.031 --> 31:21.498
Mmm.

31:25.864 --> 31:27.365
So, what are you
still doing here?

31:27.448 --> 31:29.039
I thought you left already.

31:29.115 --> 31:32.366
Maybe I'm a masochist,
but I still want

31:32.448 --> 31:33.744
to be like my sister, cousin.

31:33.823 --> 31:35.665
Oh, my.

31:35.823 --> 31:37.449
Get me into some scrubs.

31:46.906 --> 31:50.578
<i>♪ I heard your voice
through a photograph ♪</i>

31:50.782 --> 31:52.327
<i>♪ I thought it up
and brought up... ♪</i>

31:56.989 --> 31:58.410
You got in today?

32:00.699 --> 32:05.120
Yes. It's been years
since I've practiced.

32:05.198 --> 32:06.494
I've come to see Dr. Brown,

32:06.573 --> 32:09.449
but he's busy, so I thought
I'd lend a hand.

32:10.823 --> 32:11.823
Welcome,

32:14.823 --> 32:15.914
Thank you.

32:22.989 --> 32:24.785
Can you finish
cleaning those wounds'?

32:24.864 --> 32:26.490
All right, Doctor.

32:28.073 --> 32:30.415
It's become too dangerous
for the organization

32:30.490 --> 32:32.785
to stay operational
here in Monrovia.

32:35.156 --> 32:37.077
I couldn't be more sorry.

32:37.615 --> 32:39.490
The LURD already
control the ports.

32:39.864 --> 32:41.285
That's what I'm hearing.

32:41.699 --> 32:43.415
And that there's
no food anywhere.

32:43.490 --> 32:44.661
Ahh...

32:47.657 --> 32:49.782
We can't stay here.

32:50.948 --> 32:52.869
I'm going to take
a group of vulnerables

32:52.948 --> 32:56.324
that the Protection staff
have identified.

32:57.281 --> 32:59.327
We'll follow the exodus
to the border.

33:01.407 --> 33:03.453
It's okay.

33:04.281 --> 33:06.373
It's okay, ifs okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

33:08.198 --> 33:09.994
Chili Peppers, best medicine.

33:21.573 --> 33:24.743
<i>The explosion of a mortar
so close to the hospital</i>

33:24.823 --> 33:26.949
<i>suggested Monrovia
may be overrun</i>

33:27.031 --> 33:28.827
<i>by rebels within weeks“.</i>

33:29.323 --> 33:31.119
<i>If not days.</i>

33:33.031 --> 33:35.373
<i>As our foreign doctors
and refugees</i>

33:35.448 --> 33:36.993
<i>packed their belongings,</i>

33:37.323 --> 33:39.244
<i>my young cousin Ellen
gave me a tutelage</i>

33:39.323 --> 33:41.914
<i>in the personalities
that would be accompanying me</i>

33:41.989 --> 33:44.705
<i>in the exodus to Sierra Leone.</i>

33:45.657 --> 33:47.373
Lovely man.

33:47.823 --> 33:50.370
He came here when his wife died.

33:51.073 --> 33:53.039
Can you guess his name?

33:53.948 --> 33:56.744
Love, Dr. Love.

33:56.823 --> 33:58.915
That's perfect.

33:59.739 --> 34:02.331
Dr. Leon,
he's an amazing doctor.

34:02.407 --> 34:04.373
We had to drag him
from the rural areas

34:04.448 --> 34:05.663
to work in the city.

34:06.532 --> 34:08.748
You can fire me,
but I'm going to stay.

34:10.156 --> 34:12.248
Listen, ifs safer
than what you're doing,

34:12.322 --> 34:13.322
taking the road.

34:13.572 --> 34:16.869
And if things get crazy,
I can flirt with a U.N. guy

34:16.947 --> 34:18.494
and get on one
of those helicopters.

34:18.572 --> 34:19.619
Excuse me, ladies.

34:19.697 --> 34:22.074
My father asked me
to tell you everyone is ready.

34:22.572 --> 34:23.743
And who are you?

34:23.989 --> 34:27.989
Samuel Posas Palleh,
son of the great Mousa Palleh.

34:28.864 --> 34:30.331
That's your dad right there?

34:30.739 --> 34:31.955
Yes,

34:32.197 --> 34:33.822
Come, let's go.

34:35.864 --> 34:38.784
Come on. Let's go.
Jesus is wailing.

34:38.864 --> 34:42.364
He waits, and He waits,
even for you.

34:43.322 --> 34:45.119
I was sorry to hear
we're pulling out,

34:45.197 --> 34:47.197
but it has gotten very sketchy,

34:47.489 --> 34:49.034
You will have
no cell phone coverage

34:49.114 --> 34:50.739
once you cross Po River Bridge.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.369
Your driver has a satphone,

34:52.447 --> 34:54.494
so call me if there's
any problem, okay?

34:54.781 --> 34:58.373
<i>God and colonialism
had visited upon Liberia,</i>

34:58.823 --> 35:02.541
a <i>particular ugliness
in the nature of their war,</i>

35:02.948 --> 35:07.199
<i>heroic adults assassinated
or forced to flee,</i>

35:07.281 --> 35:10.122

<i>Those not convinced

35:19.240 --> 35:23.207
<i>bravely pled for the help

35:27.532 --> 35:30.533
<i>We were rewarded

35:40.572 --> 35:43.789
<i>Until the weather itself
became invisible.</i>

35:47.323 --> 35:48.843
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

35:48.906 --> 35:50.827
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

35:50.906 --> 35:52.373
Get out of the car!

35:56.864 --> 35:59.910
NGO! We're NGO!

36:00.031 --> 36:01.031
NGO!

36:13.698 --> 36:15.619
Okay, move! Go! Go!

36:16.448 --> 36:19.539
He's dead.
They took his satphone.

36:27.531 --> 36:29.132
- We are on our own.
- Are you okay?

36:29.156 --> 36:31.576
- It's getting dark soon.
- Yeah, yeah,

36:32.031 --> 36:33.247
A piece of the seat bit me.

36:33.323 --> 36:36.619
Okay, grab everything.
Take that big one.

36:36.823 --> 36:37.744
Let's go.

36:37.823 --> 36:39.573
We have to go,
before they come back.

36:39.656 --> 36:40.656
They might come back.

36:40.698 --> 36:41.818
- What can I take?
- Come on!

36:42.156 --> 36:45.952
- Go with him. Go up.
- Come, kid. Come.

36:46.489 --> 36:48.865
Go up, go straight.
Go to the right.

36:49.198 --> 36:50.198
Go, be careful.

36:52.948 --> 36:55.324
Sorry you had to visit us
in this time of trouble.

36:55.407 --> 36:57.498
Maybe you can come back
some other time.

36:57.572 --> 36:59.448
How many cards do you have'?

37:03.989 --> 37:07.831
Sam, switch to green.
We're near the road.

37:09.281 --> 37:12.872
- Dr. Love?
- Where did you go?

37:13.281 --> 37:16.907
Mousa, we have an injured woman.
Machete wound.

37:17.614 --> 37:20.535
The villagers brought a woman
from the road,

37:20.906 --> 37:24.623
Machete. We'll need an IV
and an anesthetic.

37:24.698 --> 37:26.619
- Okay.
- They took all the anesthetic.

37:26.698 --> 37:28.415
I've got some Xylocaine

37:28.489 --> 37:30.489
and some Ketamine
in my backpack.

37:30.572 --> 37:32.118
Good.
Bring everything you've got.

37:32.198 --> 37:36.370
This way, Dr. Love.
Dr. Love! This way!

37:37.989 --> 37:39.285
What's going on?

37:40.614 --> 37:42.489
Just watch your sisters.
We'll be back.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.660
Get the tarp up.
I don't want her getting wet.

37:53.656 --> 37:55.202
- Get her up.
- Okay.

37:55.365 --> 38:00.116
Help me. One, two, three...
Take it easy.

38:00.323 --> 38:01.369
- Gloves?
- Gone.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.413
- Betadine?
- Also gone.

38:03.781 --> 38:06.657
I knew I brought that whiskey
for something.

38:10.948 --> 38:13.119
- Farber, get the line in.
- Can you hold that for me?

38:13.198 --> 38:14.948
- Gloves?
- Everything gone.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.581
Here, can you hold that for me?
Thank you.

38:23.073 --> 38:25.244
Take the whiskey.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.040
What's wrong, Mommy?

38:34.531 --> 38:35.782
She's pregnant.

38:37.656 --> 38:39.998
- Superficial...
- And she's bleeding.

38:40.156 --> 38:41.406
- Winnie!
- Yes, Ma'am?

38:41.489 --> 38:43.647
- Come here! Come quick!
- Coming, Ma'am.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.446
- Come, hold this leg.
- Try to hold your arm still.

38:46.489 --> 38:47.535
All the way up.

38:47.614 --> 38:51.286
No damage to the carotid.
The sutures are overlapping.

38:52.572 --> 38:55.573
This baby's head's
wedged right in there.

39:00.698 --> 39:03.199
- I'm pulling out clots.
- It's an abrupted placenta.

39:04.073 --> 39:05.618
Okay, hold her flat.

39:09.656 --> 39:12.328
Wait.
What are we doing?

39:13.073 --> 39:14.368
I'm going to section her.

39:14.864 --> 39:16.240
You're going
to section her here?

39:16.323 --> 39:18.119
Yeah.
Give her the Ketamine.

39:19.031 --> 39:21.781
Listen to me.
Listen, listen.

39:22.281 --> 39:23.781
Listen, we'll do
everything we can

39:23.864 --> 39:25.206
for you and your baby, okay?

39:25.281 --> 39:26.281
Okay?

39:26.406 --> 39:27.952
Assatu, you're going
to be comfortable,

39:28.031 --> 39:29.077
you're going to be strong,

39:29.156 --> 39:30.476
and everything's
going to be okay.

39:31.115 --> 39:32.581
Okay, Ketamine's going in.

39:38.406 --> 39:41.407
- Refugees. Okay.
- Okay, everyone. I'm cutting.

39:54.447 --> 39:56.618
Okay, here we go.

39:58.823 --> 39:59.664
Okay, pull.

39:59.739 --> 40:01.018
I'm closing the neck wound.

40:14.115 --> 40:16.161
- Wow, it's really wedged.
- Yeah.

40:16.489 --> 40:17.535
Really wedged.

40:17.614 --> 40:20.115
Try to manipulate
the baby's head upward, please.

40:20.406 --> 40:21.531
Okay.

40:21.614 --> 40:24.206
Winnie. Legs up again.
All the way up.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.280
Yes, Ma'am.

40:25.364 --> 40:26.410
Up!

40:29.531 --> 40:30.531
More. Push.

40:30.698 --> 40:32.323
Wait.

40:35.572 --> 40:38.413
Okay. Head is out!

40:38.489 --> 40:40.206
- Syringe!
- Head is out.

40:44.447 --> 40:46.914
Okay. Fast.

40:48.447 --> 40:49.447
Okay.

40:51.656 --> 40:53.782
I have to rotate the baby.

40:55.531 --> 40:58.998
Okay. Okay, little one.

41:03.239 --> 41:04.535
Baby's out.

41:04.906 --> 41:06.281
Switch all to green.

41:06.364 --> 41:07.535
Okay, thank you.

41:07.614 --> 41:10.081
Okay. Okay. Cutting.

41:10.156 --> 41:12.531
- How is that'?
- Pulse rate is slow.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.535
<i>Let me. Let me.</i>

42:00.656 --> 42:04.123
Assatu's baby is doing well.
Assatu can rest.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.952
We both could do with
that bottle of whiskey, huh'?

42:40.989 --> 42:42.910
The sacrifices we make, huh?

43:16.280 --> 43:18.121
Are you kidding me?

43:23.614 --> 43:25.330
Is nothing sacred to you?

43:26.322 --> 43:28.197
Everything is sacred to me.

43:29.906 --> 43:31.156
Everything-

43:38.406 --> 43:41.247
There's a path that zigzags
the creek over there.

43:41.322 --> 43:43.573
I think that's the quickest
route to Sierra Leone.

43:43.656 --> 43:46.032
- Through the jungle?
- Through the jungle.

43:46.489 --> 43:47.785
You've got to be kidding.

43:47.989 --> 43:50.660
Don't think that the paths
aren't known by the bad guys.

43:50.739 --> 43:52.956
When you run
into them out there...

44:19.364 --> 44:21.160
There you go.

44:21.698 --> 44:23.073
Yeah.

44:24.197 --> 44:27.824
Thank you, in the name of Jesus.

44:28.155 --> 44:29.872
In the name of Jesus?

44:30.030 --> 44:32.747
I prefer it
in the name of you and me.

44:45.906 --> 44:50.202
Hey, listen, last night, I...
I overreacted.

44:50.489 --> 44:51.580
It's all right.

44:51.656 --> 44:53.372
You were embarrassed to kiss me

44:53.447 --> 44:55.823
with unbrushed teeth,
that's all.

45:01.197 --> 45:05.369
My father came and went a lot.
What does that tell you'?

45:06.030 --> 45:09.406
That we had different
experiences, that's all.

45:10.280 --> 45:12.996
- And?
- And nothing.

45:13.072 --> 45:15.448
It's nice to share
different experiences.

45:22.364 --> 45:24.035
<i>What about your mother?</i>

45:24.489 --> 45:26.615
<i>She had an affair.</i>

45:26.864 --> 45:29.205
<i>And then another affair.</i>

45:29.906 --> 45:32.827
<i>Maybe my dad was away too much.</i>

45:34.364 --> 45:39.365
<i>After my father died,
my mother wrote me.</i>

45:42.197 --> 45:43.993
<i>She told me she missed him.</i>

45:48.030 --> 45:51.531
<i>I don't even think
she called him for years.</i>

45:53.947 --> 45:56.073
<i>She mm me...</i>

45:57.280 --> 46:02.623
if I wanted a repetitive life.
I should see many men.

46:04.489 --> 46:08.410
But if I wanted
endless diversity, “

46:11.364 --> 46:13.911
I should slay with one.

46:15.406 --> 46:17.452
What do you think?

46:17.614 --> 46:20.330
Was your father away too much?

46:21.614 --> 46:24.364
I think children spell love...

46:25.698 --> 46:30.574
T-I...

46:31.280 --> 46:35.827
M-E.

46:44.947 --> 46:47.789
But I'm not a child anymore.

48:11.072 --> 48:14.289
<i>Miguel's attentions
diminished my fears</i>

48:14.364 --> 48:16.410
<i>in this terrifying place'</i>

48:17.239 --> 48:20.240
<i>This place.
At this time.</i>

48:21.614 --> 48:23.330
<i>Where children, fed mixtures</i>

48:23.406 --> 48:26.657
<i>of amphetamines
and hallucinogens,</i>

48:26.988 --> 48:29.080
<i>had been convinced by commanders</i>

48:29.155 --> 48:31.281
<i>that by the eating
of enemy hearts</i>

48:31.988 --> 48:34.955
<i>would they be
made invisible in battle.</i>

48:56.239 --> 48:57.740
I got it.

49:01.322 --> 49:03.664
- Okay?
- Don't stand there.

50:51.155 --> 50:52.315
I'm going to see if I can use

50:52.364 --> 50:53.955
a satphone to get
through to Paris.

50:54.030 --> 50:54.871
Okay.

50:54.947 --> 50:58.574
Hey. Another one
of Dr. Leon's babies.

50:58.738 --> 51:00.330
This one is both of ours.

51:05.489 --> 51:07.909
- Dr. Leon!
- I've got a patient.

51:08.155 --> 51:10.780
- Where should I take her?
- Medical NGOs are this way.

51:10.863 --> 51:12.205
They'll set up a tent for you.

51:13.280 --> 51:17.156
Hi. I'm project manager
at MDM.

51:17.239 --> 51:18.330
How can we help you today?

51:18.406 --> 51:19.465
We have a few refugees with us.

51:19.489 --> 51:20.809
I was hoping
to use your satphone.

52:24.531 --> 52:28.452
IRC requested us
to implement operations here.

52:29.697 --> 52:31.789
Oh, really?
What did you tell them?

52:32.863 --> 52:36.410
HQ approved,
so I volunteered us.

52:41.072 --> 52:42.572
"Us"?

52:44.697 --> 52:45.788
Mm-hmm.

52:47.447 --> 52:51.993
All of us, the four MDM staff
that came with us.

52:53.780 --> 52:55.530
Okay.

52:56.863 --> 52:58.534
That's nice.

52:59.697 --> 53:01.993
So, I've been demoted
to general practice.

53:07.406 --> 53:11.872
- Are you okay with that'?
- Yes, I'm okay with that,

53:14.863 --> 53:16.829
So, we're staying here.

53:18.239 --> 53:19.490
Okay.

53:22.114 --> 53:24.955
You should try
and get some sleep.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.372
I'm not tired.

53:33.072 --> 53:35.868
So. we're both not tired.

53:44.197 --> 53:45.322
Mm-hmm.

54:03.447 --> 54:05.788
Are you a playboy, Miguel?

54:10.280 --> 54:13.076
I'm not playing
anything here, Wren.

55:30.613 --> 55:32.705
Hmm. Hmm!

55:51.280 --> 55:52.495
Ahh!

56:32.822 --> 56:35.823
<i>We established
a clinic in the camp.</i>

56:35.947 --> 56:39.789
<i>Initial supplies had arrived
quickly by UN transport,</i>

56:39.863 --> 56:42.659
<i>and we made requests
of our own logisticians</i>

56:42.738 --> 56:45.659
<i>to set up sustainable
supply-chains.</i>

56:46.697 --> 56:49.198
<i>There is something
in propinquity,</i>

56:49.280 --> 56:52.655
<i>perhaps not to be confused
with fate.</i>

56:52.947 --> 56:55.198
<i>Only four days
before our arrival</i>

56:55.279 --> 56:56.325
<i>in Sierra Leone,</i>

56:56.405 --> 56:59.122
<i>I'd been</i> a <i>non-practicing
medical professional</i>

56:59.197 --> 57:00.868
<i>who'd taken on
the administration</i>

57:00.947 --> 57:04.698
<i>of my father's organization
from an office in Paris.</i>

57:04.780 --> 57:09.451
<i>New, I find myself reliving
for the first time...</i>

57:09.697 --> 57:12.244
<i>his extraordinary fife.</i>

57:13.571 --> 57:15.446
<i>I knew of my mother's affairs.</i>

57:15.530 --> 57:17.076
<i>But what of my father's'?</i>

57:17.155 --> 57:19.655
<i>Had he had a lover
as I had become Miguel's?</i>

57:20.655 --> 57:22.496
<i>The resilience and beauty</i>

57:22.571 --> 57:24.913
<i>offered by the refugees of war</i>

57:25.279 --> 57:28.621
<i>inspired an intoxication
of intimacy.</i>

57:28.947 --> 57:31.618
<i>And in this place
of so much war...</i>

57:32.863 --> 57:35.363
<i>Had I found peace?</i>

57:37.363 --> 57:39.580
<i>Or was I trading on Miguel's?</i>

57:41.780 --> 57:45.952
I want to see you
without me in the room.

57:57.530 --> 57:59.246
I know you are watching.

58:44.947 --> 58:47.118
I can feel you breathing.

59:00.154 --> 59:01.154
<i>You there'?</i>

59:37.613 --> 59:39.739
You're killing yourself.

59:49.446 --> 59:52.242
I just wanted
to say good-bye...

59:52.530 --> 59:57.998
and, uh, give you this back.

01:00:03.571 --> 01:00:06.913
You don't want to know
what I wrote in the letter?

01:00:10.947 --> 01:00:12.492
No,

01:00:17.154 --> 01:00:18.826
All right.

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:26.245
<i>Do...</i>

01:00:28.030 --> 01:00:30.405
what's in the letter.

01:00:30.988 --> 01:00:32.613
Whatever it is.

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:38.405
I can't.

01:00:38.738 --> 01:00:40.989
I can't, it's not...

01:00:41.113 --> 01:00:43.580
something I can "do."

01:00:45.321 --> 01:00:46.321
Never mind.

01:00:46.488 --> 01:00:48.534
- What were you gonna say?
- It can't just be said.

01:00:48.613 --> 01:00:50.613
Like what's in the letter
can't be "done"?

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:53.451
Wren, I don't know
if it's all right

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:54.872
to have said
what's in the letter,

01:00:55.488 --> 01:00:58.113
so I don't know
if I have the license to do it.

01:01:10.738 --> 01:01:15.455
I realized a while back
what it really was, the truth.

01:01:17.071 --> 01:01:19.117
What was the truth?

01:01:32.446 --> 01:01:35.117
You never loved me.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.037
I did love you, Wren.

01:01:42.279 --> 01:01:44.905
- No,
- MIGUEL: I do love you!

01:01:44.988 --> 01:01:49.079
Ten years."
You show up after ten years.

01:01:49.279 --> 01:01:51.120
Expecting what?

01:01:55.113 --> 01:01:57.159
- I do love you, Wren.
- You don't love me!

01:01:57.238 --> 01:01:59.284
You don't even know me!

01:01:59.488 --> 01:02:02.739
I'm different now,
that's what happens!

01:02:18.655 --> 01:02:21.371
Don't you fucking take
another step towards me!

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:22.963
What? What? Or you'll what?
You'll shut down?

01:02:22.987 --> 01:02:25.238
Are you sure it's me
that made you shut down?

01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:26.867
<i>Wow.</i>

01:02:27.238 --> 01:02:30.489
Bravo! Bravo!
Is that what you learned to do'?

01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:32.211
Is that what you've taught
yourself to do?

01:02:32.738 --> 01:02:34.704
Make yourself
strong enough to black out

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.030
what really fucked us up?

01:02:36.113 --> 01:02:37.659
Stop for a second!

01:02:40.697 --> 01:02:44.573
Wren, Wren, removing yourself,
blocking out does not change it.

01:02:44.655 --> 01:02:46.530
That's not gonna
make you happier.

01:02:47.946 --> 01:02:49.822
Take it from me, I know it.

01:02:51.196 --> 01:02:55.072
Wow. That's very good.
Way better than me.

01:02:55.363 --> 01:02:56.739
Wren.

01:02:56.822 --> 01:02:59.538
Wren!
Don't shit on what it was.

01:02:59.613 --> 01:03:01.839
We can't be explained away
with those short little sentences

01:03:01.863 --> 01:03:03.283
like "You never loved me."
Don't.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:05.534
Don't die in yourself
like those sheep

01:03:05.822 --> 01:03:08.447
in their comfortable
fund-raising fucking lives!

01:03:09.071 --> 01:03:10.868
That's not you, Wren.

01:03:10.946 --> 01:03:12.946
And I do know you,
that's not you.

01:03:13.488 --> 01:03:16.113
And if it was me
that changed you...

01:03:16.321 --> 01:03:18.992
Fuck me.
Don't let that happen.

01:03:19.488 --> 01:03:21.830
That would be a great loss.

01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:24.701
Fuck.

01:03:50.321 --> 01:03:51.321
Excuse me, Miss.

01:03:51.904 --> 01:03:55.451
Our school is raising money,
an organization that...

01:04:00.488 --> 01:04:04.079
Bless you. Bless you
in the name of Jesus.

01:04:04.279 --> 01:04:07.325
What about in the name
of you and me'?

01:04:09.571 --> 01:04:11.037
Mm.

01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:15.075
Thank you, Miss.

01:04:16.488 --> 01:04:18.363
<i>First-class
boarding announcement,</i>

01:04:18.446 --> 01:04:21.196
<i>Geneva to Cape Town.</i>

01:04:49.488 --> 01:04:51.286
<i>We hope
you have a pleasant flight.</i>

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.076
<i>Flight time wilt be
11 and 15 minutes to Cape Town,</i>

01:04:55.321 --> 01:04:58.788
<i>arriving 2:47 p.m.
local time.</i>

01:05:30.196 --> 01:05:31.412
<i>I learned that Miguel</i>

01:05:31.488 --> 01:05:34.079
<i>had been raised
as a child of the state,</i>

01:05:34.154 --> 01:05:37.530
<i>orphaned in Spain's
transition to democracy,</i>

01:05:38.904 --> 01:05:40.405
<i>and that out of that
he put himself</i>

01:05:40.488 --> 01:05:43.580
<i>through medical school
with the highest honors.</i>

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:48.576
<i>It occurred to me
that growing up in such a way,</i>

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:51.283
<i>he was not subject
to the contradictions</i>

01:05:51.363 --> 01:05:52.783
<i>and hypocrisies</i>

01:05:53.154 --> 01:05:56.621
<i>that we, who'd been
raised in comfort,</i>

01:05:57.363 --> 01:05:58.829
too often accept.

01:05:59.154 --> 01:06:00.279
Hello, Oom Pieter!

01:06:00.946 --> 01:06:02.197
Hello, Miss Peterson!

01:06:02.279 --> 01:06:03.279
Good to see you!

01:06:03.446 --> 01:06:05.492
<i>Ja, dankie.</i>

01:06:05.571 --> 01:06:06.731
Is the key in the same place?

01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:08.413
Ja, welcome!

01:06:08.488 --> 01:06:09.488
Thank you!

01:07:07.737 --> 01:07:10.238
Did I have the wrong date?

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:14.572
I thought you were
coming next week.

01:07:15.987 --> 01:07:19.783
I didn't call on purpose
so you wouldn't fuss.

01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:22.496
I was at the market.

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:24.821
My friend came over to me
and said,

01:07:24.946 --> 01:07:27.322
"You won't believe who has
just driven through town."

01:07:27.488 --> 01:07:30.364
So, I get groceries.

01:07:30.654 --> 01:07:32.780
I make us dinner.

01:07:40.196 --> 01:07:41.572
I'm not hungry-

01:07:45.737 --> 01:07:47.204
It doesn't matter.

01:07:47.987 --> 01:07:49.658
I make us dinner,

01:07:50.321 --> 01:07:52.321
and you eat with me.

01:08:18.029 --> 01:08:19.654
Too dark in here.

01:08:24.696 --> 01:08:26.117
Ay yi yi!

01:08:30.196 --> 01:08:31.787
Ah, c'est...

01:08:34.862 --> 01:08:37.283
Three days of depressions
too many.

01:08:37.571 --> 01:08:38.571
<i>Eat.</i>

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:42.371
I will...

01:08:50.779 --> 01:08:52.620
Sarie... leave them... really.“

01:08:53.737 --> 01:08:55.113
I leave...

01:08:55.321 --> 01:08:56.741
in one minute.

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.821
You don't have to do <i>that...</i>

01:09:04.946 --> 01:09:07.037
Just a second!
Don't say "thank you,"

01:09:07.113 --> 01:09:10.578
Just a second, I'll get Sarie.
Excuse me!

01:09:10.696 --> 01:09:11.696
Sarie!

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.197
<i>He's here...</i>

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:45.823
I'm very sorry Miss Peterson,

01:09:45.904 --> 01:09:48.451
I asked him to wait.

01:09:48.904 --> 01:09:50.575
Please, Mister,
please come back down.

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:51.529
This is not right.

01:09:51.612 --> 01:09:53.238
It's okay, Oom.

01:09:54.238 --> 01:09:55.954
It's okay.

01:10:07.862 --> 01:10:09.329
Go!

01:10:26.029 --> 01:10:29.825
I'll just leave this here.

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:38.287
Come over here.

01:10:47.904 --> 01:10:49.449
Closer.

01:10:55.445 --> 01:10:58.117
Wren, that couldn't be
the last time

01:10:58.196 --> 01:10:59.616
we saw each other.

01:11:09.612 --> 01:11:12.113
Just do normal things.

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:14.737
Mm.

01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:26.821
How did you know I'd be here?

01:11:27.321 --> 01:11:29.616
Well, I have my sources.

01:11:37.696 --> 01:11:38.696
<i>Wow.</i>

01:11:42.113 --> 01:11:43.113
Yes, I do.

01:12:06.737 --> 01:12:08.703
Here I go again.

walking to the latrines

01:13:48.238 --> 01:13:50.533
This light will be very good.

01:13:51.029 --> 01:13:53.700
It won't stop every problem,
but it helps.

01:13:53.779 --> 01:13:56.030
Shall we toast?
Can I join the party, huh'?

01:13:56.154 --> 01:13:57.449
"And the Lord said..."

01:13:58.612 --> 01:14:00.158
"Let there be light."

01:14:00.238 --> 01:14:02.034
Ah, very good.

01:14:02.529 --> 01:14:05.076
Who knows the Genesis chapter
from the Bible?

01:14:05.154 --> 01:14:08.450
The first chapter,
who knows it, huh'? Sam!

01:14:08.612 --> 01:14:09.612
You do.

01:14:13.445 --> 01:14:15.196
Very good!

01:14:15.529 --> 01:14:17.245
Why haven't you married?

01:14:17.862 --> 01:14:19.407
You want us married?

01:14:19.821 --> 01:14:22.287
Yes, I want that for you.

01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:24.244
Life is hard.

01:14:24.404 --> 01:14:26.155
You need another person
to share it with.

01:14:26.904 --> 01:14:27.995
All right, then.

01:14:28.612 --> 01:14:30.612
Let me see, Who can I grab'?

01:14:30.696 --> 01:14:33.867
- I'm gonna just grab“.
- It is not grabbing.

01:14:36.404 --> 01:14:38.496
It is loving.

01:14:39.696 --> 01:14:41.412
Loving.

01:14:48.154 --> 01:14:49.779
What?

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:55.446
- You have no idea!
- I did not come alone.

01:14:55.570 --> 01:14:57.286
Someone's here to see you.

01:14:57.529 --> 01:15:01.200
Oh, my God! Ellen!

01:15:01.278 --> 01:15:03.199
I didn't know you were still
in the country.

01:15:03.529 --> 01:15:04.529
Hi.

01:15:05.612 --> 01:15:07.453
What are you doing here?

01:15:08.154 --> 01:15:10.199
- Miguel's with you?
- Uh-huh.

01:15:10.529 --> 01:15:12.200
Are you all right?

01:15:13.654 --> 01:15:16.700
No, I'm not all right.
I knew better.

01:15:16.862 --> 01:15:18.407
I knew better
than to have stayed.

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.241
- Still here.
- I see, I see.

01:15:24.904 --> 01:15:26.245
You're together, right?

01:15:26.862 --> 01:15:27.862
Mm-hmm.

01:15:28.612 --> 01:15:29.783
That's what I heard.

01:15:30.696 --> 01:15:33.196
Nice of you to have
gotten word to me,

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:36.113
Did he ever mention
we'd been together

01:15:36.195 --> 01:15:38.742
for the past year
before you came?

01:15:43.153 --> 01:15:46.154
I should have known, though.

01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:49.491
With some people, it's drugs,
others, it's alcohol,

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:52.117
and with Miguel, it's women.

01:15:52.404 --> 01:15:54.780
- How he...
- Copes, right'?

01:15:54.862 --> 01:15:57.612
And I knew it,
so what am I saying is...

01:16:02.904 --> 01:16:07.200
I didn't...
I didn't realize.

01:16:07.946 --> 01:16:09.696
I just thought
you'd be the one person

01:16:09.779 --> 01:16:10.950
who wouldn't have...

01:16:11.612 --> 01:16:12.612
fallen into...

01:16:13.654 --> 01:16:15.075
Psht

01:16:19.195 --> 01:16:21.366
I hate myself like this.

01:16:21.737 --> 01:16:23.737
This is what always happened.

01:16:24.612 --> 01:16:26.738
It was perfect.
Your whole thing, Miguel.

01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:28.821
And your position is so clear.

01:16:28.904 --> 01:16:32.120
"This is the way I am,
so you take it or leave it."

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.912
Then I can only end up
hating myself

01:16:33.987 --> 01:16:35.908
for having accepted that.

01:16:36.195 --> 01:16:39.662
Because l...
I fucking loved you.

01:16:46.987 --> 01:16:48.202
Do you want me to leave?

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:52.946
No. He does his things.

01:16:53.362 --> 01:16:57.864
Anyway, the reason
I'm here is that...

01:16:59.237 --> 01:17:01.237
I tested positive for HIV.

01:17:02.153 --> 01:17:03.654
What?

01:17:04.612 --> 01:17:06.704
I was hoping the retest
would be different,

01:17:06.779 --> 01:17:09.905
but then... surprise!

01:17:10.529 --> 01:17:12.279
Have you given blood?

01:17:12.362 --> 01:17:14.658
Had your blood tested
in the last few weeks?

01:17:23.112 --> 01:17:29.955
No. I'm gonna give you
a second.

01:17:31.904 --> 01:17:34.030
Okay. Ellen.

01:17:35.195 --> 01:17:38.492
How can I help you?
What can I do for you? Tell me.

01:17:49.195 --> 01:17:50.616
You don't think
you were unprotected

01:17:50.696 --> 01:17:52.492
in the operating room
in some way?

01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:54.755
- Got stuck with a needle?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:17:54.779 --> 01:17:56.495
But I think you both
should be tested.

01:17:57.570 --> 01:18:00.662
Or with you, we could fuck.
Then we'd be sure.

01:18:03.028 --> 01:18:05.074
I want you to have it.

01:18:07.862 --> 01:18:09.453
No, I don't.

01:18:11.237 --> 01:18:13.784
I just don't want
to be alone with it.

01:18:15.153 --> 01:18:17.370
And it could be
sort of romantic.

01:18:21.237 --> 01:18:22.829
I don't like house music.

01:18:23.028 --> 01:18:25.654
I know. I know.
I know.

01:18:49.153 --> 01:18:51.153
What are you thinking, Wren?

01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:00.161
I'm thinking I miss my dad'

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.741
I never told Ellen I loved her.

01:19:04.946 --> 01:19:06.412
Never.

01:19:08.654 --> 01:19:10.370
Amazing.

01:19:11.904 --> 01:19:13.995
She doesn't even have that.

01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:21.491
You told me,
"Everything is sacred."

01:19:22.112 --> 01:19:25.409
"Everything."
That's what you said.

01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:27.366
I remember now.

01:19:30.862 --> 01:19:31.952
Beatrice!

01:19:34.112 --> 01:19:36.238
Let me know as soon as you can'

01:20:36.487 --> 01:20:37.829
What are you thinking?

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:41.570
What?

01:20:42.903 --> 01:20:43.949
Hmm.

01:20:47.028 --> 01:20:48.903
Are you going
to spoil it already?

01:20:51.612 --> 01:20:53.829
Completely.

01:20:56.112 --> 01:20:59.954
That's my girl!

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:02.366
That's my girl.

01:21:08.445 --> 01:21:09.445
Go.

01:21:09.487 --> 01:21:10.533
Shh.

01:21:25.696 --> 01:21:28.866
Girls... Girls...

01:21:28.945 --> 01:21:31.241
I'm sleeping!

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:45.447
Our tests were both negative.

01:21:47.612 --> 01:21:50.908
And Ellen landed in Paris.

01:21:51.362 --> 01:21:53.237
She's being treated.

01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:59.447
For what it's worth,
I told Ellen I loved her.

01:22:02.778 --> 01:22:04.324
<i>But...</i>

01:22:06.362 --> 01:22:08.488
I never...

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:16.572
meant that I loved her
as I do love...

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:19.036
<i>...you.</i>

01:22:21.195 --> 01:22:23.786
So I know you don't like me
very much in this moment.

01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:26.786
I understand.
But maybe we could just...

01:22:26.903 --> 01:22:29.529
get out of the camp for a day
and take a drive somewhere.

01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:37.787
<i>♪ Let's go for a drive now! ♪</i>

01:22:40.153 --> 01:22:42.574
Oh, my God.
You guys are so annoying!

01:22:43.529 --> 01:22:46.496
All right, Listen to me.

01:22:47.278 --> 01:22:48.278
I'll go...

01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:52.116
because the two of you
want me to go, Okay?

01:22:53.487 --> 01:22:55.737
♪ ...I don't ♪

01:22:56.487 --> 01:23:01.454
<i>♪ I don't believe it's bad ♪</i>

01:23:02.153 --> 01:23:06.154
<i>♪ Slit my throat, it's all I ever ♪</i>

01:23:06.654 --> 01:23:08.904
- Really?
- What?

01:23:09.153 --> 01:23:11.495
"Pour my life
into a paper cup...

01:23:11.778 --> 01:23:14.154
The ashtray's full,
and I'm spilling my guts.“

01:23:15.778 --> 01:23:19.950
Listen. "Still a slut."
Pathetic. Pathetic.

01:23:20.445 --> 01:23:23.070
My God! She's trying
to confuse me.

01:23:23.153 --> 01:23:26.529
She thinks wars
and women are my heroin.

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:29.991
Wren, listen. Anthony wants
to make it on the other side,

01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:31.321
Oh, Anthony.

01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:33.616
I can feel a song

01:23:33.695 --> 01:23:35.537
without it being
my autobiography.

01:23:35.861 --> 01:23:37.533
- It's universal.
- Thank you.

01:23:38.445 --> 01:23:40.820
God. Snakes! Snakes!

01:23:44.362 --> 01:23:47.033
Come on. Come on.
Come here, please. Come here.

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.820
I'm gonna kiss you.

01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:54.661
- Do you wanna kiss her?
- Why do you wanna kiss her?

01:23:54.736 --> 01:23:55.736
Because I wanna kiss you!

01:23:56.153 --> 01:23:57.673
You're so full of it.
Do you know that?

01:23:58.237 --> 01:23:59.782
You know what he wants to do?

01:23:59.945 --> 01:24:02.287
All he wants to do
is kiss. Haaah...

01:24:02.861 --> 01:24:05.408
That's it. Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

01:24:06.028 --> 01:24:08.370
Oh, my God!
Miguel, put the window down!

01:24:08.445 --> 01:24:12.036
It's not funny! God!
This is so fucking dangerous!

01:24:12.112 --> 01:24:13.613
I thought you were a surgeon!

01:24:23.112 --> 01:24:24.112
What?

01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:31.946
Winnie. Winnie, call it in.
Cover the girls' eyeballs.

01:24:32.028 --> 01:24:35.120
Cover your sisters'
eyeballs now! I'm coming.

01:24:40.153 --> 01:24:42.245
Oh, my God.

01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:44.741
Oh, my God.

01:25:19.445 --> 01:25:21.661
L... I'm a doctor, okay?

01:25:21.736 --> 01:25:23.016
We are here to help the wounded.

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:27.912
We are here-We are doctors.
Doctors. MDM. MDM'?

01:25:27.986 --> 01:25:30.782
- Miguel.
- MDM.

01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:33.741
- Okay'? We are...
- No!

01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:34.962
We are here to help the wounded.

01:25:34.986 --> 01:25:36.952
No! No!

01:25:37.112 --> 01:25:38.828
- Wait! Wait!
- No!

01:25:45.569 --> 01:25:47.615
Oh, no.

01:25:50.653 --> 01:25:52.325
He was running on fumes.

01:25:52.487 --> 01:25:54.453
This must be one of the boys
who did this.

01:25:54.903 --> 01:25:57.279
The villagers must have tried
to defend themselves.

01:25:57.653 --> 01:26:00.074
- He was left behind.
- Over there! Over there!

01:26:02.945 --> 01:26:06.866
Please, Doctor!
Doctor! Please, Doctor!

01:26:07.528 --> 01:26:10.370
.Okay. Okay.

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.287
Okay. That's burnt.

01:26:12.362 --> 01:26:14.254
Mousa, I wanna get
your kids back to the camp.

01:26:14.278 --> 01:26:16.744
We need to bring
them to the van.

01:26:18.195 --> 01:26:19.320
In the back.

01:26:26.278 --> 01:26:27.449
Hurry.

01:26:27.778 --> 01:26:30.699
Bring her in here.
Everybody in?

01:26:31.112 --> 01:26:32.908
Everybody in'?
I'm gonna close, okay?

01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:35.032
I'm gonna close.

01:26:35.903 --> 01:26:36.903
Blood!

01:26:39.362 --> 01:26:42.158
I've been asking for blood
for the last two weeks.

01:26:44.362 --> 01:26:46.612
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.570
Syringe, please. Please.
Syringe, yeah.

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:16.741
We have Dulcolax. Great!
How did we end up with that?

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.991
Do you know its other uses
besides constipation?

01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:20.286
- Does it have any?
- No.

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:22.695
Okay.

01:27:22.778 --> 01:27:23.949
What happened?

01:27:24.362 --> 01:27:26.112
Your body shut down,
you collapsed.

01:27:26.569 --> 01:27:27.820
It's okay, it happens.

01:27:27.903 --> 01:27:29.824
I gave you a sedative.
Are you okay?

01:27:31.444 --> 01:27:35.196
One, two, three,
four, five, six... six.

01:27:35.528 --> 01:27:38.904
We have enough blood
for only one of the patients...

01:27:38.986 --> 01:27:42.362
to survive the night.
Only one. Okay?

01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:46.787
So... do you wanna pick?

01:27:48.945 --> 01:27:51.570
It's hard stuff.
It's hard stuff.

01:27:55.404 --> 01:27:58.154
I'll decide. If you want.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.411
Because if we split it up,
no one will make it.

01:28:02.028 --> 01:28:04.869
All right?
One. Wren, one.

01:28:07.986 --> 01:28:09.736
We shouldn't be here,
to begin with,

01:28:12.736 --> 01:28:14.907
If you pull us out,
we abandon these people

01:28:14.986 --> 01:28:15.986
when they need us most.

01:28:16.028 --> 01:28:18.324
No! No, we're not
abandoning anyone!

01:28:18.403 --> 01:28:22.030
We use leaving to call attention
to what's happening here.

01:28:22.195 --> 01:28:23.991
- We use the press.
- Okay.

01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:26.196
They will give up
on Middle Eastern oil

01:28:26.278 --> 01:28:28.324
and come rushing
into West Africa.

01:28:28.820 --> 01:28:29.991
Come on, Wren.

01:28:31.569 --> 01:28:32.865
This?

01:28:33.778 --> 01:28:35.449
This feels so futile.

01:28:35.528 --> 01:28:36.653
Listen.

01:28:36.736 --> 01:28:38.702
We stay here or we go,

01:28:38.778 --> 01:28:41.824
not because we think we're
gonna save the world. Correct?

01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:43.629
So when you're talking
about pulling out,

01:28:43.653 --> 01:28:45.949
do me a favor and just say
it's because you're afraid.

01:28:47.362 --> 01:28:50.238
Okay? Or because
you want to have a bath.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:54.116
Or you want them
to have a bath. It's okay.

01:28:54.903 --> 01:28:56.494
Even if you do gel them noticed,

01:28:56.569 --> 01:28:58.286
then what happens?
What happens?

01:28:58.361 --> 01:29:00.703
I've never seen the oppressed
not become the oppressors.

01:29:00.778 --> 01:29:01.869
Never once.

01:29:03.361 --> 01:29:05.862
- Well, then, let's just give up!
- What?

01:29:06.112 --> 01:29:07.112
Let's just give up!

01:29:07.195 --> 01:29:08.570
Let's just pack
our stuff and go!

01:29:08.653 --> 01:29:09.921
- What are we doing here?
- No, no, no, no.

01:29:09.945 --> 01:29:13.242
Let's save this man, that girl.
This baby. Here, now.

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.661
Save them for what?
What kind of world?

01:29:15.861 --> 01:29:17.112
Theirs.

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.945
That's your solution?

01:29:20.153 --> 01:29:21.448
Wren, there isn't a solution.

01:29:21.611 --> 01:29:23.032
We don't have a solution.

01:29:23.112 --> 01:29:24.828
For this?
No, there is no solution.

01:29:25.237 --> 01:29:27.487
Maybe I'm wrong.
Evolution is the solution.

01:29:27.569 --> 01:29:29.036
But you have
the patience for that?

01:29:29.112 --> 01:29:31.033
Oh, my God.
They need to evolve?

01:29:31.403 --> 01:29:33.200
- You're racist now?
- No, no, no!

01:29:33.278 --> 01:29:34.994
Hey. I'm not talking
about them here.

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:36.254
I'm talking
about the unconscious

01:29:36.278 --> 01:29:37.493
wealthy people out there!

01:29:37.569 --> 01:29:38.785
You think I don't know that?

01:29:38.861 --> 01:29:42.203
The Americans, the Europeans,
the wealthiest.

01:29:42.778 --> 01:29:44.323
The majority here is not greedy,

01:29:44.403 --> 01:29:45.712
They're walking
out of their homes

01:29:45.736 --> 01:29:47.953
and their countries to stay
out of the way of war.

01:29:48.278 --> 01:29:50.078
- They're living their solution.
- Oh, living?

01:29:50.153 --> 01:29:51.911
They should live,
that is a solution.

01:29:51.945 --> 01:29:53.695
- Live? Live.
- Yeah, live.

01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:58.116
Watch the ant crawl up the tree,
and dance. Flirt.

01:29:58.361 --> 01:30:03.158
Laugh at the baby.
Yes, live, in any way they can.

01:30:03.237 --> 01:30:05.037
This is the life that was
given to them, Wren.

01:30:05.569 --> 01:30:06.820
That's brave, Miguel.

01:30:06.903 --> 01:30:10.279
Absolves you of ever having
to think beyond today.

01:30:11.903 --> 01:30:14.120
The West can stop this

01:30:14.195 --> 01:30:16.786
if they get involved
in the right way.

01:30:16.903 --> 01:30:20.449
I am not saying I, personally,
am gonna save the world.

01:30:20.528 --> 01:30:23.779
I am saying I wanna do
anything I can to stop this!

01:30:24.403 --> 01:30:26.995
Instead of fooling myself
out here playing God

01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:28.536
to a lucky few!

01:30:29.195 --> 01:30:31.411
You really think I need
something for myself?

01:30:31.486 --> 01:30:32.754
You don't know
a fucking thing about me!

01:30:32.778 --> 01:30:35.245
And being inside me is not
knowing me, evidently!

01:30:35.736 --> 01:30:38.828
Oh, and I don't need them
to be like me,

01:30:38.903 --> 01:30:40.574
if that's what you meant
about the bath!

01:30:40.986 --> 01:30:42.281
I've lived in Africa.

01:30:42.361 --> 01:30:44.282
I know what these people
are up against!

01:30:44.361 --> 01:30:46.213
And I'm not, all of a sudden,
gonna sit here and say,

01:30:46.237 --> 01:30:49.204
"Fuck this! There's no hope!"
just to keep you company!

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:52.074
You couldn't try?

01:30:52.403 --> 01:30:53.654
Oh, my God.

01:30:55.945 --> 01:30:57.411
You don't want
to keep me company,

01:30:57.486 --> 01:30:58.953
just a little bit?

01:31:01.361 --> 01:31:03.487
I need my prayer mat.

01:31:11.569 --> 01:31:12.615
Forgive me.

01:31:14.861 --> 01:31:17.032
You're here with us.
Thank you.

01:31:17.778 --> 01:31:20.199
But you know
you can leave at any time.

01:31:21.444 --> 01:31:24.320
It is not
until you can't leave...

01:31:26.153 --> 01:31:27.994
that you can know.

01:31:53.028 --> 01:31:54.403
I really thought...

01:31:55.028 --> 01:31:57.869
that boy might kill you today.

01:31:58.444 --> 01:32:01.194
I'm gonna go and play God

01:32:01.611 --> 01:32:03.004
and put some blood
into one of those patients.

01:32:03.028 --> 01:32:06.574
No. I'll do it.

01:32:09.778 --> 01:32:13.369
Wren, I...
I was scared today, too.

01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:21.240
All right.

01:32:22.695 --> 01:32:25.741
I wanna know what
that man's typing is right now.

01:32:25.903 --> 01:32:27.028
<i>A pos?</i>

01:32:27.861 --> 01:32:29.987
- Yes.
- All right, he's getting all 6.

01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:32.820
Prep him, we're transfusing him.

01:32:50.486 --> 01:32:52.407
- What is it?
- We gotta move!

01:32:52.611 --> 01:32:53.782
What's the matter?

01:32:53.861 --> 01:32:55.532
- They need us!
- We have to go.

01:32:56.277 --> 01:32:57.903
We gotta get across the border.

01:32:58.112 --> 01:33:00.908
It's bad. The rebels used
a lot of civilians.

01:33:00.986 --> 01:33:01.986
For what?

01:33:02.152 --> 01:33:03.903
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's go!

01:33:03.986 --> 01:33:05.827
We can get the details later.

01:33:05.903 --> 01:33:08.244
No, no! Winnie go back!
Sam, go back!

01:33:08.361 --> 01:33:11.033
It's dangerous for civilians.
You're not coming! Get back.

01:33:11.111 --> 01:33:11.953
You stay with us, Mousa!

01:33:12.028 --> 01:33:13.212
People are dying.
They need everyone.

01:33:13.236 --> 01:33:14.078
It's not safe here.

01:33:14.152 --> 01:33:15.778
Young boys rape women
in the night.

01:33:15.861 --> 01:33:17.452
- We go with Mousa.
- No! Everybody...

01:33:17.528 --> 01:33:19.620
I am Project Coordinator!
I make the decision here!

01:33:19.695 --> 01:33:20.837
- We are brave.
- No, Sam!

01:33:20.861 --> 01:33:23.407
Hold on. One second, please!
Wren, what do you wanna do'?

01:33:23.486 --> 01:33:24.987
We're not taking the children.

01:33:25.111 --> 01:33:27.828
Let's go together.
If you decide, we can walk back.

01:33:27.986 --> 01:33:31.828
- No! Everybody, stop!
- Let's go! People are dying!

01:33:32.152 --> 01:33:34.653
Okay, I'm in the back.
Let's go, let's go.

01:33:40.111 --> 01:33:41.236
Doctors.

01:33:41.986 --> 01:33:45.032
- Doctors. We have to go through.
- We have to go!

01:33:45.736 --> 01:33:48.361
<i>There was something
unthinking in it,</i>

01:33:48.486 --> 01:33:51.987
<i>something blinding
in the addiction to emergency,</i>

01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:56.286
<i>that we allowed the children
to accompany us,</i>

01:33:56.695 --> 01:34:00.366
<i>that we unquestioningly
re-crossed the border.</i>

01:34:00.569 --> 01:34:02.240
<i>It was not Miguel.</i>

01:34:03.028 --> 01:34:04.448
<i>I was not myself.</i>

01:34:08.152 --> 01:34:10.653
<i>But together, it was need.</i>

01:34:13.319 --> 01:34:15.069
<i>And to be needed...</i>

01:34:18.695 --> 01:34:20.366
<i>was everything.</i>

01:34:28.444 --> 01:34:29.444
Let's get to work.

01:35:30.194 --> 01:35:31.990
Let Farber take it.

01:36:48.277 --> 01:36:50.902
- Dr. Petersen.
- Yes, I'm coming.

01:36:52.361 --> 01:36:54.612
Why are there so many young men,

01:36:55.778 --> 01:36:58.824
<i>boys</i> with chest wounds?

01:36:59.778 --> 01:37:02.198
They were used as human shields
by the rebels.

01:37:15.152 --> 01:37:18.903
Really.
You know?

01:37:18.985 --> 01:37:19.985
No.

01:37:20.653 --> 01:37:22.244
I'll have to read that poem.

01:37:34.736 --> 01:37:38.782
I am Malesh Roe.

01:37:43.277 --> 01:37:46.198
Where is my daughter Fatou'?

01:37:47.444 --> 01:37:49.285
Is she living?

01:38:00.944 --> 01:38:03.240
She wants to be
with her daughter.

01:38:04.819 --> 01:38:06.445
If we can find her,
and she's alive,

01:38:06.528 --> 01:38:08.119
we'll operate.

01:38:09.319 --> 01:38:10.535
What did you just say?

01:38:11.902 --> 01:38:14.244
She wants to be
with her daughter.

01:38:16.944 --> 01:38:18.411
Do you want to live?

01:38:20.486 --> 01:38:21.906
That's for God.

01:38:22.486 --> 01:38:24.031
It's not up to her.

01:38:26.611 --> 01:38:28.611
She wants to be
with her daughter.

01:38:28.695 --> 01:38:30.320
- Jesus.
- That's what she said.

01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:31.702
What?

01:38:31.778 --> 01:38:35.074
You can't do that.
Wren, you can't do that!

01:38:35.277 --> 01:38:36.528
What is your daughter's name?

01:38:36.653 --> 01:38:37.574
Fatou.

01:38:37.653 --> 01:38:39.403
Fatou? Fatou Roe?

01:38:39.486 --> 01:38:41.612
We don't let
the patients decide!

01:38:41.695 --> 01:38:44.741
Beatrice. Her daughter's name
is Fatou Roe.

01:38:44.819 --> 01:38:46.445
Check triage
to see if she survived.

01:38:47.194 --> 01:38:48.194
What, now?

01:38:48.277 --> 01:38:49.528
Yes, now!

01:39:00.444 --> 01:39:05.741
We are going to let...

01:39:05.985 --> 01:39:08.486
Malesh'? Malesh.

01:39:09.902 --> 01:39:13.153
Are going to let Malesh
be with her daughter.

01:39:15.069 --> 01:39:16.910
It's wrong, Wren.

01:39:21.569 --> 01:39:23.365
Just for pain.

01:39:23.777 --> 01:39:24.902
Matan.

01:39:39.027 --> 01:39:41.653
I'm not gonna let her suffer
through an operation

01:39:41.735 --> 01:39:43.077
if she's gonna die anyway.

01:39:44.152 --> 01:39:46.323
Get her comfortable right now!
Over there!

01:39:47.444 --> 01:39:48.695
Who's giving up now'?

01:39:53.528 --> 01:39:55.073
We have to get into the chest

01:39:55.152 --> 01:39:57.323
and clamp the hilum
of the 10-year-old,

01:39:58.611 --> 01:40:00.407
Are you going to assist me?

01:40:00.985 --> 01:40:03.532
Sister, are these all
of the people that are here?

01:40:03.611 --> 01:40:04.452
The young girls.

01:40:04.528 --> 01:40:05.928
The young children
that you've seen?

01:40:06.819 --> 01:40:09.786
I'm looking for Fatou Roe.
Fatou Roe.

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:11.111
Have you seen Fatou Roe?

01:40:11.194 --> 01:40:12.587
Wren, we need you.
Are you coming in'?

01:40:12.611 --> 01:40:14.952
I'm looking for a satphone.
I have to make a call.

01:40:15.027 --> 01:40:15.868
I'm stopping this today.

01:40:15.944 --> 01:40:17.570
Are you gonna stop all of this?
Great.

01:40:17.653 --> 01:40:19.369
We need your help
in there now, Wren.

01:40:19.444 --> 01:40:21.661
We're not helping!

01:40:22.194 --> 01:40:24.069
Okay, fine, pack.
Go, leave!

01:40:24.152 --> 01:40:25.777
Leave if you can't
take it anymore.

01:40:26.152 --> 01:40:29.028
Go make your phone call.
And if her daughter is alive,

01:40:29.277 --> 01:40:31.653
take them back with you
to the great West!

01:40:35.486 --> 01:40:37.702
Wren, can you please
try not to wrestle

01:40:37.777 --> 01:40:39.403
your father's ghost today?

01:40:40.152 --> 01:40:41.152
Please.

01:40:44.361 --> 01:40:46.702
You think you know who I am.

01:40:47.027 --> 01:40:49.244
You don't know who I am, Miguel.

01:40:49.319 --> 01:40:50.319
And just to be clear,

01:40:50.652 --> 01:40:52.494
I hate being told who I am

01:40:52.902 --> 01:40:54.448
more than anything in the world.

01:40:54.819 --> 01:40:56.320
I'd rather be told what to do

01:40:56.403 --> 01:40:58.529
than to be told
who or what I am.

01:41:00.486 --> 01:41:03.157
Okay. So I will never
do that again, okay?

01:41:04.694 --> 01:41:06.320
And I will think of...

01:41:06.403 --> 01:41:09.028
I will think of lots of things
that I can tell you to do,

01:41:09.111 --> 01:41:13.157
like... like sit or work, or...

01:41:19.444 --> 01:41:22.069
I got a little one, there.

01:41:25.152 --> 01:41:28.244
- Hey.
- What?

01:41:30.361 --> 01:41:32.986
I was just thinking...

01:41:36.985 --> 01:41:39.202
you're still perfect to me.

01:41:55.652 --> 01:41:57.449
Are you coming or going?

01:42:00.902 --> 01:42:04.119
Lady, you better make
your fucking decision!

01:43:20.236 --> 01:43:21.827
<i>Wren.</i>

01:43:23.944 --> 01:43:25.445
Wren.

01:43:25.568 --> 01:43:28.035
MSF wants us to stay.

01:43:30.527 --> 01:43:33.869
It is almost curfew for
the border until morning.

01:43:36.027 --> 01:43:37.118
All right.

01:43:40.652 --> 01:43:42.324
We're pulling out.

01:44:14.111 --> 01:44:15.907
<i>Why haven't you married?</i>

01:44:16.819 --> 01:44:18.195
<i>Life is hard.</i>

01:44:18.568 --> 01:44:20.694
<i>You need another person
to share it with.</i>

01:46:43.069 --> 01:46:44.240
You Okay?

01:46:44.318 --> 01:46:45.569
I'm all right. You okay?

01:46:45.819 --> 01:46:49.319
Mwah!

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:50.402
Ow!

01:46:54.443 --> 01:46:56.614
Dad, aren't we gonna leave?
Yes?

01:46:56.694 --> 01:46:57.694
Yes, we are.

01:46:58.485 --> 01:47:00.077
All the patients in the triage

01:47:00.152 --> 01:47:01.743
cleared out a few minutes ago.

01:47:02.152 --> 01:47:03.402
They just left.

01:47:15.236 --> 01:47:16.861
Let's go. Inside.
Get in the car.

01:47:16.944 --> 01:47:20.115
Get down! Samuel,
gel inside, stay down.

01:47:38.318 --> 01:47:39.318
Clear!

01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:41.860
Yam

01:47:58.152 --> 01:47:59.447
See this one, no?

01:48:23.777 --> 01:48:25.073
What's you, my brother?

01:48:26.235 --> 01:48:27.577
He's a doctor.

01:48:31.027 --> 01:48:32.493
You got anything for us?

01:48:40.485 --> 01:48:42.952
Princess... They your toy.

01:48:47.527 --> 01:48:49.698
Move on!

01:48:49.777 --> 01:48:51.169
What are you doing?
What are you... '?

01:48:51.193 --> 01:48:52.364
Wren, Wren.

01:49:01.568 --> 01:49:02.989
What are you doing? What?

01:49:06.735 --> 01:49:07.906
Give me your watch, man!

01:49:10.193 --> 01:49:11.193
Ya, Doctor?

01:49:12.443 --> 01:49:13.694
Why you wearing my watch?

01:49:19.568 --> 01:49:20.864
Didn't you hear the man'?

01:49:21.111 --> 01:49:23.577
What you need it for?
Your time finished.

01:49:23.652 --> 01:49:25.073
- Stop!
- Wail, wait, wait.

01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:27.485
Very funny, Doctor...

01:49:30.151 --> 01:49:31.402
Give me your watch, man.

01:49:34.777 --> 01:49:35.777
Give me your shoe!

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:37.361
Give me your shoe also!

01:49:40.652 --> 01:49:42.402
Doctor, that's a very nice shoe!

01:49:47.485 --> 01:49:48.406
No here.

01:49:48.485 --> 01:49:50.702
- Don't hurt my pa!
- Sam.

01:49:51.819 --> 01:49:53.615
- Sam, go back!
- You.

01:49:53.694 --> 01:49:56.911
- You come here. Come.
- Our Commander call you.

01:49:58.652 --> 01:50:01.744
- Sam! Sam!
- Stand there.

01:50:03.235 --> 01:50:05.782
Your pa?
He answer for you?

01:50:05.902 --> 01:50:07.447
You always do what your pa say'?

01:50:08.151 --> 01:50:10.527
- Eh'? He can't talk'?
- He can't understand you.

01:50:10.610 --> 01:50:12.656
- He's not right in the head.
- He can't talk?

01:50:13.735 --> 01:50:16.781
Listen.
I'll be your pa and your ma.

01:50:17.027 --> 01:50:18.197
- Please.
- No?

01:50:18.276 --> 01:50:20.447
- Then, what you living for?
- Please, don't.

01:50:22.027 --> 01:50:25.948
- You give your son to me, okay?
- Please. Please, don't.

01:50:26.694 --> 01:50:28.865
Can you obey somebody
that's not your pa?

01:50:30.402 --> 01:50:33.494
You think your pa something?
Just watch,

01:50:34.151 --> 01:50:39.323
- No, no, no, stop!
- Miguel! Miguel!

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.110
What I witness I'll report!

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:47.110
What she witness,
she'll report. Good.

01:50:47.193 --> 01:50:48.193
You enjoying it'?

01:50:50.235 --> 01:50:52.736
- You, slap your pa.
- Miguel,

01:50:52.819 --> 01:50:55.410
- GI Commando. Slap your pa!
- Slap your pa!

01:50:55.485 --> 01:50:57.702
- Miguel.
- It's okay, Sam. Do it!

01:50:58.652 --> 01:50:59.652
Do it.

01:51:02.485 --> 01:51:03.861
You slap hard!

01:51:04.568 --> 01:51:07.409
- Do it, Samuel!
- Goddamn it! Just please stop!

01:51:07.485 --> 01:51:09.030
- Slap your pa!
- Slap me.

01:51:09.110 --> 01:51:11.588
- Leave the kid alone.
- Stop! He's just a child!

01:51:11.819 --> 01:51:14.035
- More hard! Harder!
- More!

01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:15.611
- Do it.
- Slap your pa!

01:51:16.151 --> 01:51:18.197
- More hard!
- Do it!

01:51:18.318 --> 01:51:19.660
- Harder!
- Do it!

01:51:20.026 --> 01:51:22.527
- Please, stop!
- Harder, harder, harder!

01:51:22.735 --> 01:51:24.952
Slap him! Harder, harder!

01:51:25.318 --> 01:51:26.159
Harder, harder!

01:51:26.235 --> 01:51:27.461
Leave the kid alone.
Leave him alone.

01:51:27.485 --> 01:51:31.156
- Do it!
- Harder! Slap your pa!

01:51:31.318 --> 01:51:32.694
Slap hard!

01:51:41.318 --> 01:51:44.034
Go on. Take this one.

01:51:44.110 --> 01:51:45.361
Take the fucking gun, man.

01:51:45.984 --> 01:51:47.576
- Take it.
- Take the gun, man!

01:51:48.068 --> 01:51:49.068
Take it!

01:51:54.318 --> 01:51:56.068
- Fire your pa.
- Fire your pa.

01:51:56.694 --> 01:52:00.035
- Fire your pa! Fire!
- Fire your pa,

01:52:00.110 --> 01:52:01.110
Fire your' pa!

01:52:03.902 --> 01:52:06.072
Don't do this!
Please don't!

01:52:06.151 --> 01:52:10.618
Fire! Fire your pa.

01:52:10.694 --> 01:52:12.911
- Leave him alone!
- For God's sake!

01:52:12.984 --> 01:52:14.656
- Fire your pa.
- Fire, fire your pa.

01:52:14.735 --> 01:52:15.576
- Fire your pa.
- Fire your pa!

01:52:15.652 --> 01:52:18.277
Beautiful son.
Do it. I love you.

01:52:18.485 --> 01:52:19.906
- Fire him.
- No, Sam!

01:52:20.318 --> 01:52:22.569
No!

01:52:22.652 --> 01:52:24.823
- Get back! Get back!
- Sam! Sam!

01:52:25.777 --> 01:52:27.493
What is wrong with you?

01:52:27.735 --> 01:52:32.236
- What is wrong with you?
- My son!

01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:53.486
You. You snapped the bullet.

01:54:21.276 --> 01:54:23.368
No,

01:54:23.984 --> 01:54:25.781
No!

01:54:40.485 --> 01:54:42.406
Wait, wait.
Miguel! Miguel!

01:54:42.818 --> 01:54:44.285
Miguel, we're leaving!

01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:48.486
What's he doing? Miguel!

01:54:52.984 --> 01:54:54.781
Wren, get inside the car!

01:54:56.235 --> 01:54:57.235
Wren!

01:55:02.193 --> 01:55:03.614
Go!

01:55:18.859 --> 01:55:20.201
<i>I always think...</i>

01:55:20.859 --> 01:55:23.360
<i>about how white his shirts were.</i>

01:55:24.527 --> 01:55:26.368
<i>His little shins. Sam.</i>

01:55:28.485 --> 01:55:30.531
<i>How did he always
get them so white?</i>

01:55:31.776 --> 01:55:34.243
<i>I think he just had the one.</i>

01:55:36.026 --> 01:55:37.992
<i>Cleaned it himself.</i>

01:55:45.110 --> 01:55:47.236
You should know
I always waited for you,

01:55:47.318 --> 01:55:49.114
even though I didn't want to.

01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:52.614
I waited for you, too, Wren.

01:55:53.610 --> 01:55:55.360
You never came back.

01:55:55.859 --> 01:55:57.405
I tried,

01:55:58.901 --> 01:56:01.573
I did try, I just...

01:56:02.151 --> 01:56:04.572
I knew I would never stay'

01:56:05.485 --> 01:56:07.951
To be us and war...

01:56:17.485 --> 01:56:20.656
I don't know if there would
be an us without war.

01:56:24.443 --> 01:56:26.409
Tell me that's not true.

01:56:29.068 --> 01:56:30.864
I can't.

01:56:33.110 --> 01:56:34.201
Can you?

01:56:37.943 --> 01:56:39.194
No,

01:56:40.443 --> 01:56:41.489
Tell me that's not true.

01:56:41.568 --> 01:56:42.988
It's not true.

01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:47.110
It's not true.

01:56:47.652 --> 01:56:48.493
Tell me...

01:56:48.568 --> 01:56:50.489
Tell me it's not true.

01:56:56.193 --> 01:57:00.069
It's... one story, Wren.

01:57:10.110 --> 01:57:13.486
What story are you
telling yourself now, Miguel?

01:57:14.026 --> 01:57:15.277
Hmm?

01:57:18.568 --> 01:57:20.034
Is it the one where you ask me

01:57:20.110 --> 01:57:21.655
to come back
to the field with you?

01:57:23.568 --> 01:57:27.285
Yes. I've been
thinking about that.

01:57:28.651 --> 01:57:29.651
<i>But...</i>

01:57:30.734 --> 01:57:33.406
But it would be
too much to ask, right'?

01:57:33.485 --> 01:57:34.531
Yeah.

01:57:36.527 --> 01:57:38.697
It would be unfair to me.

01:57:39.068 --> 01:57:40.489
Pretty much.

01:57:42.193 --> 01:57:43.943
Yeah.

01:57:45.610 --> 01:57:47.030
And you? What... what“?

01:57:47.110 --> 01:57:48.906
What story are you
telling yourself?

01:57:50.026 --> 01:57:52.993
The story where I stay here?

01:57:53.568 --> 01:57:55.113
And we have this...

01:57:56.443 --> 01:57:58.569
beautiful house
in the middle of nowhere

01:57:58.651 --> 01:58:01.652
with kids running around?

01:58:02.151 --> 01:58:06.573
And you working from home,
me being a family doctor?

01:58:09.527 --> 01:58:10.697
No,

01:58:13.110 --> 01:58:15.236
The one that you belong there.

01:58:16.818 --> 01:58:18.034
In the field.

01:58:20.693 --> 01:58:22.319
That that's who you are.

01:58:29.318 --> 01:58:30.863
- Yes.
- But it scares me.

01:58:31.984 --> 01:58:32.984
So much.

01:58:36.318 --> 01:58:37.738
I wish I could.

01:58:40.485 --> 01:58:42.701
- I wished...
- I wish...

01:59:22.859 --> 01:59:26.860
<i>When I was a little girl,
my father was often away.</i>

01:59:27.443 --> 01:59:29.159
<i>I asked him once,</i>

01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:34.361
"Dad, what was the most
unexpected thing you ever saw?“

01:59:35.567 --> 01:59:40.910
He told me he'd been
somewhere near Cambodia,

01:59:41.110 --> 01:59:43.202
on an island.

01:59:44.402 --> 01:59:47.494
Supporting the boat refugees
in the early '70s.

01:59:48.443 --> 01:59:52.160
<i>He was a young doctor
tending to an elderly man</i>

01:59:52.443 --> 01:59:54.943
<i>sitting against a tree.</i>

01:59:55.734 --> 01:59:57.326
He asked the man,

01:59:57.818 --> 02:00:02.194
“If you could have anything,
what would you want?"

02:00:04.026 --> 02:00:08.027
My father assumed
it would be food or money...

02:00:10.484 --> 02:00:12.235
but the man answered.

02:00:12.526 --> 02:00:15.902
"I would like a book of anything

02:00:16.276 --> 02:00:18.742
from classic French literature."

02:00:19.693 --> 02:00:23.240
<i>The man had been a professor
of literature at a university</i>

02:00:23.318 --> 02:00:25.239
<i>until the day...</i>

02:00:25.567 --> 02:00:28.989
the day he was displaced.

02:00:30.484 --> 02:00:32.655
It seems we look at refugees

02:00:32.901 --> 02:00:35.617
as if that's all
they've ever been.

02:00:36.526 --> 02:00:38.152
That they're not like us.

02:00:39.609 --> 02:00:41.450
<i>But they are like us.</i>

02:00:42.609 --> 02:00:44.701
They're workers...

02:00:45.484 --> 02:00:49.951
accountants, teachers,
builders. farmers.

02:00:50.484 --> 02:00:53.326
They have families.

02:00:54.110 --> 02:00:56.236
And they have dreams.

02:00:58.734 --> 02:01:00.860
<i>Dreams.</i>

02:01:02.442 --> 02:01:06.410
So much of the world today
has been parted from its dreams.

02:01:06.484 --> 02:01:09.156
Wars attack dreams.

02:01:09.235 --> 02:01:11.701
Poverty attacks dreams.

02:01:11.943 --> 02:01:15.035
Natural disasters attack dreams.

02:01:15.110 --> 02:01:19.906
Disease attacks dreams.

02:01:21.276 --> 02:01:23.446
But with your belief...

02:01:23.859 --> 02:01:26.484
even more than your money...

02:01:27.984 --> 02:01:33.281
they will achieve their dreams,
and I'll tell you why.

02:01:37.776 --> 02:01:40.323
Because dreams are not luxuries,

02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:45.076
any more than refugees
are not like us.

02:01:45.151 --> 02:01:48.697
They are us.

02:01:48.776 --> 02:01:50.277
And, just like ours,

02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:53.156
their dreams,
more than air itself.

02:01:53.235 --> 02:01:58.656
Are the single most fundamental
of all human necessities.
