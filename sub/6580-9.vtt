- Morning.
- Morning, Dr. Choi.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.453
Every patient should be asked
if they'd like to fill one out.

Yeah, but a DNR?

At this point,
she may think it's the best thing.

No, thanks.

07:57.622 --> 07:59.155
Listen, I read a prospectus

08:00.492 --> 08:02.058

08:02.060 --> 08:03.393
A radioimmunotherapy drug.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.161
Veltarmomab, very promising.

08:05.163 --> 08:06.129
That's the one.

08:06.131 --> 08:07.597
Listen, I got this patient.

08:07.599 --> 08:09.866
She's tried everything, nothing's worked.

08:09.868 --> 08:12.201
I'm pretty sure she fits
the profile for your study.

08:12.203 --> 08:13.936
I'm sorry, but the trial's closed.

08:13.938 --> 08:14.904
It's full.

08:14.906 --> 08:16.105
Zoe, this woman is end-stage.

08:16.107 --> 08:17.306
She's got a kid.

08:17.308 --> 08:18.741
I'm looking for anything
to give her more time.

08:18.743 --> 08:20.410
I get it, but...

08:20.412 --> 08:22.111
Just try.

08:22.632 --> 08:23.746
Please?

08:26.885 --> 08:28.991
Let me make a call to our medical director.

08:30.099 --> 08:31.587
No promises, though.

08:31.933 --> 08:33.159
All right.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.791

- Kidney failure?

08:44.369 --> 08:45.868
Yeah, but it doesn't make sense.

08:45.870 --> 08:47.879
A woman this young?

08:48.423 --> 08:50.237
I don't get it.

08:50.942 --> 08:52.241
Call the renal service.

08:52.243 --> 08:54.525
She needs to be admitted
to the MICU for dialysis.

08:54.673 --> 08:56.512
Okay.

09:02.454 --> 09:03.753
and then we'll run the bowel.

09:03.755 --> 09:06.712
- TA 55 blue stapler.
- Stapler.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.592
Dr. Zanetti. Dr. Rhodes.

09:09.594 --> 09:11.594
Dr. Downey,
I thought they were sending a resident.

09:11.596 --> 09:13.029
Had a window before my next surgery.

09:13.031 --> 09:14.263
You don't mind?

09:14.265 --> 09:16.699
No, this kid just caught some good luck.

09:16.701 --> 09:18.801
Who butchered him?

09:18.803 --> 09:20.536
He fell off some scaffolding.

09:20.538 --> 09:23.495
I meant the cracked chest.

09:23.975 --> 09:25.141
Yeah, that was me.

09:25.143 --> 09:27.743
Hmm, can we get to work on the heart?
How's the gut?

09:27.745 --> 09:30.379
Just had to fix a hole
in the stomach, but we're done.

09:30.381 --> 09:32.048
- Give the 5,000 heparin.
- Yes, Dr. Downey.

09:32.050 --> 09:34.417
Get a 6-0 prolene with pledgets loaded up.

09:34.419 --> 09:35.551
Rhodes, change your gloves.

09:35.553 --> 09:37.286
I want you to help me up here.

09:37.288 --> 09:38.488
He's about to close the abdomen.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.489
I'll assist.

09:39.491 --> 09:40.723
You close.

09:40.725 --> 09:43.259
Rhodes, I want you to fix the ventricle.

09:44.662 --> 09:47.029
Well,
Dr. Zanetti really has more experience.

09:47.031 --> 09:48.464
You made this mess, you clean it up.

09:48.466 --> 09:50.269
Unless you don't feel up to it.

09:54.005 --> 09:56.072
Right.

10:00.230 --> 10:03.874
[suction gurgling]

10:04.971 --> 10:08.372
Uh, too deep with the needle.

10:08.887 --> 10:11.031
Hit the AV node,
you're gonna have to explain to the parents

10:11.130 --> 10:14.164
why their son needs a pacemaker
for the rest of his life.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.156
Let me see the repair.

10:23.088 --> 10:24.554
That works.

10:25.198 --> 10:27.189
Close up the chest when you're
done with the abdomen, will you?

10:27.200 --> 10:28.884
Yes, Dr. Downey.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.176
You don't have any tremor.

10:34.291 --> 10:36.566
Even for a young guy, that's pretty good.

10:38.955 --> 10:40.036
[scoffs]

10:40.038 --> 10:42.773
Not that I'm jealous or anything,
but you just received high praise

10:42.775 --> 10:44.548
from David Downey.

10:45.027 --> 10:47.310
Why did he have me do the heart?

10:47.312 --> 10:50.280
I'm asking myself the same question.

10:54.682 --> 10:57.020
Sorry to cause you so much trouble.

10:57.022 --> 10:59.055
That's all right, sir.

10:59.057 --> 11:02.459
After you bag the clothes,
take them in for analysis.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.494
Guess I let things get out of hand.

11:04.496 --> 11:05.762
Hard to keep clean.

11:05.764 --> 11:07.831
Pants too, please.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.333
Where do you live?

11:10.335 --> 11:13.403
Lots of places.

11:13.405 --> 11:15.672
In winter, Lower Wacker.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.140
By the heat vents.

11:17.142 --> 11:19.443
Well, why not a shelter?

11:20.220 --> 11:21.678
Don't like them.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.413
Too many rules.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.383
What about my skivvies?

11:28.515 --> 11:30.147
Those too.

11:39.264 --> 11:41.264
Dr. Halstead.

11:41.576 --> 11:42.566
Yeah?

11:42.568 --> 11:44.501
I just spoke to the medical director.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.770
He's going to let your
patient into the trial.

11:46.772 --> 11:48.805
Oh, that is great.

11:50.118 --> 11:53.076
You might've just saved her life.

11:53.078 --> 11:54.611
Thank you, Zoe.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.546
Sure.

11:56.548 --> 11:58.548
[exhales sharply]

11:58.550 --> 12:01.551
[nurse chuckles]

12:02.165 --> 12:03.987
There you go.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.398
Mrs. Baker,

12:05.661 --> 12:07.805
I have some very good news.

12:08.267 --> 12:10.823
A pharmaceutical company
is conducting a clinical trial

12:10.922 --> 12:12.983
that you qualify for.

12:13.082 --> 12:14.998
A new cancer drug.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.933
I was able to get you in.

12:20.446 --> 12:21.963
Mrs. Baker?

12:24.643 --> 12:26.877
Sal, can you take Bailey outside?

12:27.290 --> 12:28.078
Yeah.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.222
Yeah, sure, yeah.

12:30.651 --> 12:32.597
Come on, honey, girl.
Let's go find something to eat.

12:32.679 --> 12:33.669
But I'm drawing.

12:33.735 --> 12:35.235
All right,
you can do that when we come back.

12:35.334 --> 12:36.588
Okay.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.946
Oh, thank you.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.173
The trial's oncologist is
gonna need to examine you.

12:44.206 --> 12:45.605
I'd like to set that
up as soon as possible.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.497
Sorry, no more trials.

12:48.524 --> 12:50.434
- Mrs. Baker...
- You know how I feel.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.635
But this is very promising.

12:51.637 --> 12:53.904
A new radioimmunotherapy drug.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.172
Very similar to Tositumomab,

12:55.174 --> 12:56.940
which you've done before,
but this works by...

12:56.942 --> 12:59.543
Dr. Halstead, you're not listening to me.

12:59.545 --> 13:01.178
I'm done.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.946
I've tried everything.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.832
[chuckles]

13:04.917 --> 13:06.580
You have nothing to lose.

13:06.778 --> 13:08.752
Yes, I do.

13:08.754 --> 13:11.888
The drugs make me sick,
and weak, and exhausted.

13:11.890 --> 13:13.123
I throw up.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.158
I'm in constant pain, and my family

13:15.160 --> 13:16.260
suffers as much as I do.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.794
But you may react differently to this.

13:17.796 --> 13:19.663
It could be a game changer.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.765
That's what the last
1/2 dozen doctors said,

13:21.767 --> 13:23.686
and yet, here we are.

13:27.199 --> 13:28.567
Dr. Manning?

13:28.765 --> 13:31.241
I think we should let Mrs. Baker rest.

13:36.908 --> 13:38.882
I know you're trying to help...

13:41.723 --> 13:45.155
But I can't do this anymore.

13:45.157 --> 13:48.425
I want to live out the rest of my life
with the people I love,

13:48.427 --> 13:50.785
and not in a hospital.

13:52.431 --> 13:54.965
We understand.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.267
We'll check back later.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.373
Dr. Halstead?

14:09.081 --> 14:11.148
Thanks for the help in there.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.716
What is with you?

14:12.718 --> 14:14.851
Last time I checked,
we're supposed to be saving lives.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.187
She has made her wishes very clear.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.062
She can't just give up.

14:20.914 --> 14:23.026
My mother died of cancer.
If she had access to a drug like this,

14:23.028 --> 14:24.677
she might still be alive.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.506
Did you page me?

14:36.508 --> 14:39.643
Yeah, I'd like you to assist.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.378
The E.D. hasn't sent up

14:41.380 --> 14:43.146
any trauma patients in the last hour.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.281
Isn't a trauma.

14:44.283 --> 14:45.849
65-year-old woman.

14:45.851 --> 14:48.318
Aortic valve replacement.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.987
AV replacement... You want me to assist?

14:50.989 --> 14:52.622
Work on your suturing technique.

14:52.624 --> 14:55.125
You can move a little faster.

14:55.127 --> 14:57.461
Dr. Downey, I'm a trauma surgeon,

14:57.463 --> 14:58.929
not a cardiothoracic surgeon.

14:58.931 --> 15:01.465
Sewing is sewing.

15:02.778 --> 15:04.434
I cleared this with Sharon.

15:04.997 --> 15:07.371
Wash your hands. Meet me inside.

15:07.373 --> 15:09.706
Put on something nice.

15:18.117 --> 15:19.612
Mr. Baker.

15:20.634 --> 15:23.253
Jen's feeling a little nauseous.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.721
Pop usually makes her feel better.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.289
That clinical trial I mentioned,

15:26.291 --> 15:28.698
it's really worth a shot.

15:29.011 --> 15:31.128
Would you talk to her?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.596
[sighs]

15:32.598 --> 15:34.164
I know what she's gonna say.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.899
All right, this is off the record,

15:35.901 --> 15:37.968
but I spoke to the pharmaceutical rep.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.385
She told me they've had some remissions.

15:40.699 --> 15:43.240
Total remissions.

15:44.162 --> 15:45.509
Please.

15:46.289 --> 15:48.011
[sighs]

15:48.013 --> 15:50.614
You know,
I would do anything to keep my wife alive,

15:50.616 --> 15:55.074
but she's... she's had so many false hopes.

15:57.256 --> 15:59.289
[chuckles]

15:59.291 --> 16:01.992
Okay, you know, I'll try.

16:02.445 --> 16:05.028
I'll try.

16:09.651 --> 16:12.035
Shower felt good.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.371
Hadn't had one since last summer.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.406
This cream will kill anything we missed,

16:16.408 --> 16:18.208
including eggs.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.310
Yeah.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.078
I'm not itching now.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.800
Arms up, please.

16:26.385 --> 16:29.019
And that should do it.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.655
An orderly will take
you to a treatment room,

16:31.657 --> 16:33.590
and we'll go find you some clothes.

16:33.592 --> 16:36.277
I'm afraid we had to burn your old ones.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.968
<i>[pager beeping]</i>

16:49.641 --> 16:50.807
[alarm blaring]

16:50.809 --> 16:52.476
- Your patient?
- Yeah, what's happening?

16:52.478 --> 16:53.510
Some kind of psychotic episode.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.278
Get away! No!

16:55.280 --> 16:56.480
Get away from me, I have to do this!

16:56.482 --> 16:57.514
Get away!

16:57.516 --> 16:59.583
Professor Gray, I'm Dr. Charles.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.251
I'm here to help you.

17:01.253 --> 17:02.452
I can't have these tubes.

17:02.454 --> 17:03.553
Get 5 of Haldol.

17:03.555 --> 17:04.753
They are trying to escape!

17:04.756 --> 17:06.790
- Who's trying to escape?
- The numbers!

17:06.791 --> 17:08.458
They're trying to get out!

17:08.460 --> 17:10.827
So you're pulling out your catheter
to keep the numbers inside?

17:10.829 --> 17:12.362
- They're trying to get out!
- Okay, easy, easy.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.430
I need the numbers! No!

17:13.432 --> 17:15.131
- Easy, easy.
- No, no, no!

17:15.133 --> 17:16.199
Give it to her!

17:16.201 --> 17:18.768
No, you can't!

17:18.770 --> 17:19.869
Grab her legs.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.739
No! I need the numbers!

17:22.741 --> 17:24.773
You can't! I'm gonna lose them!

17:24.776 --> 17:26.609
[Olivia panting]

17:26.612 --> 17:29.679
[crying] No!

17:32.684 --> 17:35.752
[Olivia sobbing]

17:47.755 --> 17:51.195
Olivia Gray has bipolar disorder.

17:51.393 --> 17:52.993
Diagnosed when she was 18.

17:52.995 --> 17:54.995
So we're dealing with
more than a medical issue.

17:54.997 --> 17:57.264
She's unstable.

17:57.266 --> 17:59.689
All due respect,
it's entirely a medical issue,

17:59.804 --> 18:01.768
and she's been dealing with her condition

18:01.770 --> 18:05.639
with lithium pretty well,
for almost 20 years.

18:05.641 --> 18:08.675
So when we put her on dialysis
it allowed her kidneys to rest,

18:08.677 --> 18:10.711
but it also cleared the
lithium from her system.

18:10.713 --> 18:13.113
Right, and sent her into that
manic state we witnessed.

18:13.115 --> 18:14.548
Olivia can't go back on the lithium.

18:14.550 --> 18:15.582
What are her options?

18:15.584 --> 18:17.217
Hard to say, you know,

18:17.219 --> 18:19.953
each one of these cases
is treated differently.

18:19.955 --> 18:24.391
I mean, her records indicate she's tried...

18:24.393 --> 18:28.377
Wellbutrin, Prozac, Effexor.

18:28.509 --> 18:30.030
Apparently, side effects were too severe,

18:30.032 --> 18:31.231
so she stuck with lithium.

18:31.233 --> 18:33.934
Well,
the side effects of lithium can kill her.

18:33.936 --> 18:36.970
The very least, she'll need a new kidney.

18:38.364 --> 18:41.041
You, uh, had much experience

18:41.043 --> 18:42.586
with, uh... with bipolar disorder,

18:42.685 --> 18:44.812
Ethan?

18:46.643 --> 18:48.282
No.

18:49.922 --> 18:51.092
<i>Look at this.</i>

18:51.208 --> 18:54.221
Woman gives us a zero
because her gown didn't fit,

18:54.223 --> 18:56.356
and this guy bitches because he couldn't

18:56.358 --> 18:58.058
change the channel on the TV.

18:58.060 --> 18:59.726
We ought to get a chance to grade them.

18:59.728 --> 19:01.562
Threw up in the waiting room, zero.

19:01.564 --> 19:03.630
Peed on the floor, zero.

19:03.632 --> 19:04.831
- Ms. Goodwin?
- I mean...

19:04.833 --> 19:05.999
Yeah.

19:06.001 --> 19:07.901
Hey, uh, I just got out of the OR

19:07.903 --> 19:10.337
assisting Dr. Downey,
and he said that you approved.

19:10.339 --> 19:12.108
I did.

19:13.097 --> 19:13.874
Why?

19:13.876 --> 19:15.703
You'll have to ask him.

19:15.917 --> 19:16.944
But you're fine with it?

19:16.946 --> 19:18.579
It's Dr. Downey.

19:18.581 --> 19:20.547
I'm fine with whatever he wants.

19:20.549 --> 19:22.316
You have a problem?

19:22.318 --> 19:24.017
I...

19:24.514 --> 19:25.786
Yeah, yeah.

19:25.788 --> 19:26.920
I do, actually.

19:26.922 --> 19:28.555
Excuse me.

19:32.194 --> 19:34.376
Mr. Brennan.

19:34.863 --> 19:37.731
I got some things I hope will fit you.

19:37.733 --> 19:39.652
You look like a medium.

19:40.098 --> 19:41.268
I think so.

19:41.813 --> 19:44.137
All right, why don't you

19:44.139 --> 19:47.441
get dressed, and then we'll sign you out?

19:47.848 --> 19:50.124
So clean.

19:51.031 --> 19:53.614
Is it okay if I lie
just a few more minutes?

19:56.086 --> 19:57.484

Sure.

20:40.263 --> 20:41.813
Dr. Downey?

20:43.766 --> 20:46.498
Uh, maybe this isn't such a good time?

20:46.630 --> 20:48.609
No, it's fine.

20:49.021 --> 20:50.504
Okay.

20:52.474 --> 20:55.815
So look, I just spoke with Ms. Goodwin.

20:56.013 --> 20:57.310
Mm-hmm?

21:00.215 --> 21:02.365
I am a trauma fellow.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.217
Right.

21:04.871 --> 21:07.287
So if I'm scrubbing in with you,

21:07.289 --> 21:10.214

Yeah.

21:18.133 --> 21:21.201
Let me tell you why I love what I do.

21:23.833 --> 21:27.874
The heart is not just a pump.

21:29.588 --> 21:31.171
Magic.

21:33.294 --> 21:36.575
This couple, they were in their car

21:36.691 --> 21:40.187
and they're having a terrible fight.

21:40.189 --> 21:42.656
In the midst of it,
they get in an accident.

21:42.658 --> 21:45.258
The husband's killed, and they transplant

21:45.260 --> 21:48.161
his heart into another man.

21:48.163 --> 21:54.034
When the recipient of this heart wakes up,

21:54.036 --> 21:58.071
he's... he's very troubled.

21:58.073 --> 22:01.090
As soon as he gets out of the hospital,
he looks up the donor's wife

22:01.206 --> 22:03.988
and he finds himself apologizing

22:04.149 --> 22:07.714
that his last words were so angry to her.

22:07.716 --> 22:12.048
He wants her to know he loves her.

22:13.322 --> 22:17.691
That wasn't this man talking.

22:18.006 --> 22:20.026
That was the heart.

22:20.438 --> 22:22.796
I like that story.

22:22.798 --> 22:25.866
I think I remember it from
when I was in eighth grade.

22:25.868 --> 22:28.436
Doesn't make it not true.

22:30.639 --> 22:32.672
Dr. Downey, the thing is,

22:32.674 --> 22:35.630
I am really more comfortable in trauma.

22:42.985 --> 22:45.652
Comfort is important.

22:46.082 --> 22:47.666
Okay.

22:50.092 --> 22:51.358
Okay?

22:53.191 --> 22:55.891

Oh, hi... sorry.

I understand I've been a lot to handle.

I'm glad you're feeling better.

- Be right back.
- Okay.

Amazing turnaround.

What did you replace the lithium with?

Lithium.

25:54.933 --> 25:56.118
Excuse me?

25:56.120 --> 25:58.521
Well, Olivia and I talked
and decided that for now,

25:58.523 --> 25:59.922
it's the best course of treatment.

25:59.924 --> 26:02.191
But she can't tolerate it.
It's destroying her kidneys.

26:02.193 --> 26:04.660
Yeah, but that's a trade-off
that she's willing to make.

26:04.662 --> 26:06.429
She can't be who she wants to be,

26:06.431 --> 26:09.280

to live without lithium.

Ms. Goodwin would like
to see you in her office.

- He agrees with me.
- Yes or no.

28:31.361 --> 28:32.618
No...

28:33.298 --> 28:35.333
But he wanted me to.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.219
And how exactly did you divine that?

28:38.301 --> 28:40.218
I couldn't just let her die for no reason.

28:40.321 --> 28:41.317
Well, there is a reason.

28:41.319 --> 28:44.527
She has a legally binding document

28:44.568 --> 28:46.299
ordering you not to do so.

28:46.390 --> 28:48.824
And don't I, as her doctor,
have a moral responsibility

28:48.826 --> 28:50.159
that supersedes that document?

28:50.161 --> 28:52.428
No, you do not, and you know that.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.363
Ms. Goodwin, she was out of her mind

28:54.365 --> 28:56.060
from the pain and the illness.

28:56.245 --> 28:58.389

what this drug could do for her.

- I did.
- This is not about you.

29:01.339 --> 29:04.244
It's about her and what she wanted.

32:18.302 --> 32:21.203

Why do you dismiss me?

32:23.384 --> 32:25.173
- What?
- You say you respect me.

You say I'm your friend.

33:10.521 --> 33:12.955
- On it.
- IVs going in.

33:13.388 --> 33:15.857
All right, breath sounds bilaterally.

33:16.933 --> 33:19.027
His belly's soft. Vitals?

33:19.029 --> 33:20.295
BP 124 over 78.

33:20.297 --> 33:22.331
Heart rate 92. Sat's 100%.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.166
- Call oncology.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.834
Oncology? This is trauma.

33:25.836 --> 33:29.304
Maybe, but Dr. Downey has liver cancer.

33:37.875 --> 33:40.310
How's he doing?

33:40.312 --> 33:41.645
He's pretty banged up,

33:41.647 --> 33:44.581
but, uh, remarkably, no real injuries.

33:44.583 --> 33:46.483
We're gonna keep him sedated for the moment

33:46.485 --> 33:48.647
so that he rests.

33:49.215 --> 33:50.854
How long have you known?

33:52.458 --> 33:53.790
Well, he was

33:53.792 --> 33:56.360
diagnosed six months ago.

33:56.362 --> 33:57.961
He told me then.

33:57.963 --> 34:00.330
He asked me to keep it confidential.

34:00.332 --> 34:02.332
He's not gonna be happy about this.

34:02.334 --> 34:03.747
What's his prognosis?

34:03.954 --> 34:05.783
Not good.

34:08.373 --> 34:10.164
Thought he was a pothead.

34:10.266 --> 34:12.302
[chuckles] Right.

34:13.277 --> 34:15.545
[breathing deeply]

34:15.547 --> 34:17.518
It's not a coincidence, is it?

34:17.725 --> 34:19.616
No.

34:19.618 --> 34:23.320
When he realized
the seriousness of his condition,

34:23.322 --> 34:25.922
he decided to find someone he could teach.

34:25.924 --> 34:30.659
Someone who had the ability to do
what he does.

34:30.661 --> 34:32.295
So what do I have

34:32.297 --> 34:35.216
that all the other surgeons
in this place don't?

34:35.793 --> 34:38.608
He saw something.

34:40.105 --> 34:42.380
You'll have to ask him when he wakes up.

34:42.525 --> 34:44.627
<i>[phone dings]</i>

34:47.348 --> 34:50.880
Excuse me.

34:55.621 --> 34:58.055
I just got word.

34:58.057 --> 35:00.090
The Bakers are suing the hospital,

35:00.092 --> 35:03.304
and pressing charges against you.

35:03.572 --> 35:06.430
It's called "wrongful life and battery."

35:06.432 --> 35:11.034
Hospital counsel will get
in touch tomorrow morning.

35:11.426 --> 35:12.769
Am I suspended?

35:12.771 --> 35:15.505
No. Not that I'm not tempted,

35:15.507 --> 35:17.941
but the hospital can't allow even a hint

35:17.943 --> 35:19.609
of possible wrongdoing.

35:19.611 --> 35:21.778
So you will continue working,

35:21.780 --> 35:24.927
and we will support you,

35:25.442 --> 35:27.484
but depending on how this goes

35:27.486 --> 35:30.884
the board may well decide to terminate you.

35:42.835 --> 35:44.835
[sighs]

35:53.011 --> 35:55.107
I don't understand what happened.

35:55.313 --> 35:57.416
He came here to die.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.249
Really?

35:59.251 --> 36:00.891
People do that sometimes.

36:01.098 --> 36:03.344
They sense they're at the end

36:03.674 --> 36:06.623
and they just want to die in a clean bed.

36:08.333 --> 36:12.496
Reese, Mr. Brennan filled out
a patient satisfaction form.

36:12.724 --> 36:14.898
You got a perfect score.

36:14.900 --> 36:17.467
All tens.

36:31.583 --> 36:33.717
Dr. Halstead.

36:35.087 --> 36:36.086
Hey.

36:36.088 --> 36:37.921
I heard.

36:38.971 --> 36:40.657
It's out there already?

36:40.659 --> 36:42.826
I think it's awful.
You did the right thing.

36:42.828 --> 36:44.728
Well, at least somebody thinks so.

36:44.730 --> 36:47.030
Once she starts the drug and feels better,

36:47.032 --> 36:49.866
she'll drop the suit. You'll see.

36:49.868 --> 36:52.120
Let's hope.

36:52.285 --> 36:54.905
Dr. Halstead?

36:55.831 --> 36:58.469
Can I buy you a drink?

37:06.540 --> 37:08.151
Sure.

37:08.153 --> 37:11.054
- I'd like that.
- Okay.

37:16.862 --> 37:18.970
[knocking on door]

37:19.794 --> 37:21.565
[snoring]

37:23.902 --> 37:25.535
Dr. Charles?

37:25.537 --> 37:26.870
You got a minute?

37:26.872 --> 37:29.777
Hey, man, what's up?

37:36.930 --> 37:38.270
W...

37:38.373 --> 37:40.146
Have a seat.

37:42.321 --> 37:44.736
Afghanistan.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.891
A field hospital, Helmand Province.

37:47.893 --> 37:50.060
We'd been up 48 hours straight
treating casualty.

37:50.062 --> 37:51.595
Uh-huh.

37:54.199 --> 37:56.403
This woman came in.

38:01.371 --> 38:05.709
She'd walked from her
village ten miles away.

38:05.711 --> 38:07.744
Had her daughter in her arms.

38:10.282 --> 38:12.240
A three-year-old.

38:14.653 --> 38:18.655
Little girl didn't have a scratch on her.

38:18.657 --> 38:22.237
Looked like she was sleeping.
This sleeping angel,

38:23.262 --> 38:25.412
but she was dead.

38:27.452 --> 38:31.053
A blast wave from a mortar round
burst her lungs.

38:36.475 --> 38:39.743
I can't stop seeing her.

38:40.090 --> 38:42.746
I try to cope,

38:42.748 --> 38:45.482
but I can't sleep.

38:45.780 --> 38:48.233
[crying] I have nightmares.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.823
I can't stop seeing her.

39:09.286 --> 39:12.175
Glad you stopped by.

39:29.628 --> 39:32.629
Dr. Rhodes.

39:35.567 --> 39:38.501
Dr. Downey.

39:38.503 --> 39:40.437
How are you feeling?

39:42.207 --> 39:45.628
I guess the cat's out of the bag.

39:45.710 --> 39:49.050
I'm sorry.

39:49.612 --> 39:52.849
Can I get you anything?

39:52.851 --> 39:56.467
Can I take your presence as a good sign?

39:59.358 --> 40:01.391
Yes, sir.

40:05.931 --> 40:07.379
[breathes deeply]

40:07.533 --> 40:10.567
You know... [clears throat]

40:10.569 --> 40:12.764
The Hawaiians

40:12.919 --> 40:17.941
have a deep reverence for the sea.

40:19.876 --> 40:22.412
They believe

40:22.414 --> 40:26.049
it's the best medicine there is.

40:26.051 --> 40:30.830
They think a swim in the ocean
can cure anything.

40:34.721 --> 40:38.554
Wouldn't a swim be nice right now?

40:41.233 --> 40:44.234
