WEBVTT

00:24.358 --> 00:27.078
I got something that just came in
this morning. It's right over here.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.490
Woman:
Honey, I don't think we can afford this.

00:31.573 --> 00:34.618
- Man: Yes, we can. Don't worry about it.
- Dealer: We can finance anybody.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.166
These aren't the numbers
that we talked about.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.335
- I would like to see the invoice.
- Why?

00:43.418 --> 00:45.098
It doesn't matter
what we paid for the car.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.421
What matters is what you pay.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.674
Now, what's the closest
you'll come to this number?

00:53.387 --> 00:56.348
Oh, Lance. You're killing me.
I won't make a dime on this.

00:59.101 --> 01:00.811
Why can't I see the invoice?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.938
What do you have,
some kind of invoice fetish?

01:03.021 --> 01:05.959
- I know it's in that drawer over there.
- It's not in that drawer over there.

01:05.983 --> 01:09.194
If I can see the invoice, I just feel like
then I would know what's going on.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.529
You know, but I don't know.

01:17.995 --> 01:21.248
- What color is this asshole?
- Don't start that shit.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.667
Will you just give me a pencil on this?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.586
He wants to see the invoice.

01:25.669 --> 01:29.339
Tell him the invoice is in the safe
at regional headquarters.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.844
This is higher than my first hit.

01:51.486 --> 01:56.116
- This... this... did you look at this?
- Yeah. These things are expensive.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.160
You got this kind of money?

02:06.710 --> 02:08.980
- I wanna talk to the owner.
- You don't want to talk to him.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.797
He's a fucking asshole.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.553
I'll be honest with you, Lance.
I went too high. You went too low.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.973
What do you say we meet
somewhere in the middle?

02:20.057 --> 02:23.810
I know math.
That is nowhere near the middle.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.313
I didn't say exactly the middle.

02:30.192 --> 02:33.487
- Who do you keep going to talk to?
- My boss.

02:33.570 --> 02:37.240
- Well, can I talk to him?
- No.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.953
The monthly payment, it seems high.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.623
You write down the number
that will make you happy.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.208
I want to make you happy.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.851
I want you to come back three years
from now and buy another car.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.463
That's how much I can pay every mon...

02:51.546 --> 02:54.091
- I mean, that would make me happy.
- Did you bump your head?

02:59.471 --> 03:01.807
What's the closest
you'll come to this number?

03:01.890 --> 03:06.436
You keep asking me that,
and I keep telling you higher numbers.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.773
But then your number doesn't get lower.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.484
Exactly.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.153
I thought we were negotiating,
but you're not...

03:15.237 --> 03:19.199
It does... I feel like I'm negotiating
but you're not negotiating.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.584
- Can I please go home now?
- You know what, Lance?

03:29.668 --> 03:32.337
I don't even feel like
you're a customer anymore.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.340
I feel like you're a friend now.

03:35.424 --> 03:38.218
Me too.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.600
- Not bad.
- Fucking right.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.495
Now go tell him the floor mats
are an extra 100.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.938
- Those are standard.
- He doesn't know that.

03:50.021 --> 03:52.899
You wanna blow this fucking deal
over floor mats?

03:52.983 --> 03:55.402
This guy's grinding me
for two fucking hours.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.155
I get him the sign...
You gotta be shitting me.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.031
Do it.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.801
You weak suck,
you gave away the floor mats.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.887
I'm not gonna blow the guy out
over floor mats.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.306
- It was a deal-breaker.
- Bullshit. That pussy was hooked.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.933
- Get out of my sight. You're fired.
- That was a home run.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.728
Two grand over sticker.
You can't fire me.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.148
You wanna bet your commission?

04:38.528 --> 04:41.239
I... fuck you, you bald prick!

04:47.621 --> 04:50.415
Remember last year's company picnic?

04:50.499 --> 04:53.001
- I fucked your wife.
- Ex-wife.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.961
In your car.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.922
You cock-sucking

04:57.005 --> 04:59.216
motherfucking Guinea asshole!

04:59.299 --> 05:03.178
You half-baked shitbag wop fucker!

05:12.646 --> 05:16.942
Let's get started.
Okay, everybody stand up.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.485
Come on. Stand up.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.320
Put one hand in the air
as high as you can.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.865
Reach way up!
Eddie, get the fuck out of that chair.

05:23.949 --> 05:26.243
- I've heard this shit.
- I don't give a fuck.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.578
These meetings are for everybody.
Reach, you old prick.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.706
Where the fuck is Sean?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.333
Keep reaching.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.130
Do you like your job?

05:40.465 --> 05:42.801
Scared the shit out of that white boy.

05:42.884 --> 05:45.679
Watch, he'll be here in four minutes.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.472
- How long do you say, Eddie?
- Six.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.432
We'll bet for lunch.
Okay, come on, everybody.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.518
Keep reaching. Little bit higher.
Come on.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.728
- Now, you all reaching as high as you can?
- Yeah.

05:53.812 --> 05:59.025
Okay, I want everybody to try real hard
and reach just a little bit higher!

05:59.109 --> 06:01.403
Come on! Bobby, you weak suck, reach!

06:01.486 --> 06:03.238
Higher!

06:03.321 --> 06:05.740
Okay, great. Now, you see, guys?

06:05.824 --> 06:07.677
The way when you thought
you couldn't do any better,

06:07.701 --> 06:10.078
you could reach just a little bit higher?

06:10.161 --> 06:12.247
If we all tryjust a little bit more,

06:12.330 --> 06:14.833
- we can sell 50 cars this weekend!
- All: Yeah!

06:14.916 --> 06:16.918
- Are we all gonna try?
- All: Yeah!

06:17.002 --> 06:19.337
All right! All right! Sit down.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.007
- Shamin, what are we?
- Whores.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.341
That's right!

06:23.425 --> 06:25.510
We are fucking whores.

06:25.594 --> 06:29.514
And we fuck, and we suck
better than anybody else!

06:29.598 --> 06:33.560
And they are gonna pay us top dollar
because we are the best!

06:33.643 --> 06:35.520
- All: Yeah!
- Ha ha ha!

06:35.604 --> 06:37.331
If you don't believe that,
get the fuck out of here.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.584
'Cause you're wasting your time
and you're wasting my time, too.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.360
My grandmother, the bitch is blind,
she can sell a car to somebody

06:42.444 --> 06:44.084
who comes in and says,
"give me that one."

06:45.906 --> 06:49.534
All right, all right.
Bobby, why are we here?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.539
Bobby, why are we here?

06:54.623 --> 06:58.793
Why won't you come down to the dealership?
Reggie said he can give you a job.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.171
- We need to eat.
- I'm trying to!

07:01.254 --> 07:04.132
What do I have to do to explain to you
that we are broke?!

07:04.215 --> 07:07.427
Reggie: Bobby, why are we here?

07:07.510 --> 07:10.639
Why are we here?

07:10.722 --> 07:14.351
Why are you here, DeLuca?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.398
To make money?

07:20.482 --> 07:23.109
Right.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.279
Lots of money.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.115
You wanna make minimum wage,
get the fuck out of here.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.788
Eddie, you owe me lunch.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.602
Okay, everybody, when Sean comes in,
I want everybody to say, "fuck you, Sean."

07:39.626 --> 07:43.213
Ready? One, two, three...

07:43.296 --> 07:46.591
All: Fuck you, Sean.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.261
All right. Shut up.

07:50.345 --> 07:53.181
Marco,
when does the salesman's job start?

07:53.264 --> 07:55.850
- 8:00 am. Saturday, boss.
- No, you piece of shit.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.435
What?

07:57.519 --> 07:59.020
Kiss ass.

07:59.104 --> 08:03.608
The salesman's job starts
when the customer says "no."

08:05.402 --> 08:07.362
Would you like to take
this baby home today, sir?

08:07.445 --> 08:08.905
Well, I don't know.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.157
- I don't think so.
- Why?

08:11.241 --> 08:13.576
Well, I'd have to check
with my wife first.

08:13.660 --> 08:17.497
Why? I don't have to check
with my wife before I sell it.

08:20.542 --> 08:23.086
Why? Why? Why? Why?

08:23.169 --> 08:25.755
No matter what they say, you ask "why?"

08:25.839 --> 08:28.258
Who's gonna be driving this car the most?

08:28.341 --> 08:30.552
-You?

08:30.635 --> 08:33.138
And the wife makes you
check with her first?

08:33.221 --> 08:36.307
- Well, she doesn't make me.
- I understand.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.143
You don't want to get in trouble.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.229
Come back after you get permission.
You can take a test drive.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.898
- I don't need permission.
- Let's go.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.736
Make them drive the car.
Make them touch it.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.488
Feel it. Smell it. Get them excited.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.825
When they're excited, they pay more.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.747
- What are you doing here so late?
- We need the money.

08:58.830 --> 09:01.124
- Didn't your hubby find a job?
- Nope.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.310
You have to be looking for a job
in order to find one.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.146
How about the insurance?
Didn't you collect on that?

09:05.170 --> 09:08.840
My brilliant husband didn't have coverage
on the truck. It was a total loss.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.052
Reggie: When a customer
makes you an offer, you say,

09:12.135 --> 09:16.014
"sir, if I could sell you this $32,000 car
for $10,000, would you take it?"

09:16.097 --> 09:17.432
When?

09:17.515 --> 09:20.101
- Right now.
- All: Right now.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.187
If he says, "yes," you say, "follow me."

09:22.270 --> 09:24.165
You turn around,
you go straight into the office.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.816
Don't turn back around,
because they'll stop. They're like dogs.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.628
If a dog is following you and you stop
and turn around, what do they do?

09:29.652 --> 09:32.072
They stop. Don't fucking stop.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.409
Man on recording: Mr. DeLuca, this is
Thomas rollins with preferred bank.

09:36.493 --> 09:41.331
I've left... and I'm keeping track...
I've left 13 messages.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.559
- Isn't it time...
- You know, I remember the good old days

09:43.583 --> 09:45.418
when it was safe to answer my own phone.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.688
I remember when I could have
a conversation with my wife

09:47.712 --> 09:50.312
- without her breaking my balls.
- You know what I can't remember?

09:51.716 --> 09:54.761
The last time my husband
brought home a paycheck.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.305
You know what your problem is?

09:57.388 --> 09:59.599
You want me to take the first job
that comes along.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.268
Well, I don't want a job.
I want a career.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.145
There's a difference.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.898
You don't get rich working
for somebody else, Donna.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.442
And I know things are tight
for us right now,

10:09.526 --> 10:11.528
but when the right opportunity
comes along,

10:11.611 --> 10:13.988
I will work my ass off
to get us out of this hole.

10:14.072 --> 10:17.700
You know that. My family is the most
important thing in the world to me.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.537
Good. Because it's about to get bigger.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.208
Don't even joke about shit like that.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.001
- Who's joking?!
- You are!

10:27.085 --> 10:29.105
You're just saying it
'cause you know if you were pregnant

10:29.129 --> 10:31.214
I would have to get a job. Anyjob!

10:31.297 --> 10:33.633
Do you actually believe
that I would do that?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.970
Has your brain
just completely rotted to shit?!

10:37.053 --> 10:39.597
Are you out of your fucking mind?!

10:45.270 --> 10:47.480
- I'm sorry.
- No. No!

10:47.564 --> 10:50.650
- Take it eas... take it easy.
- Don't, Bobby, don't.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.902
I would like to stab you
in the neck right now.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.029
You are such an asshole.

10:55.113 --> 10:57.907
You don't have to stab me in the neck.
I know I'm an asshole.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.493
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.704
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

11:06.833 --> 11:11.254
I promise you,
everything will work out fine.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.923
What are we gonna do?

11:20.054 --> 11:22.765
I guess we're gonna sell some cars.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.020
Really?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.148
Why not?

11:35.778 --> 11:38.156
So now you got the customer
in your office.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.617
The box. He's all excited.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.537
He thinks he's gonna get a top-of-the-line
limited edition for $10,000.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.707
Now you tear his fucking head off.
On the trade-in...

11:47.790 --> 11:49.751
Let's say his car is worth 20,000.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.712
You go back and you say,
"sir, I have great news.

11:52.795 --> 11:59.052
Your car could be worth
as much as $7,000.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.763
Don't be afraid of these assholes!

12:01.846 --> 12:03.306
They don't know!

12:03.389 --> 12:06.100
You're a pro!
You do this every day!

12:06.184 --> 12:08.228
Why would I buy a car from you?

12:09.354 --> 12:13.483
Because... you love me.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.611
I'm a nice guy. And I'm funny.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.529
Yeah. I like that.

12:18.613 --> 12:22.033
Make me laugh, you got a job.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.452
What's the best part of a blowjob
once you're married?

12:24.535 --> 12:27.622
- I don't know. What?
- The five minutes of silence.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.393
Are you idiots paying attention?!

12:48.476 --> 12:50.603
A baby could understand this.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.898
You write the sticker price here
in small numbers

12:53.982 --> 12:56.526
to show that's a small number.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.445
One-third of that is your down payment.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.781
Three times the first two numbers
of the purchase price

13:01.864 --> 13:03.783
is about what the payments
per month will be.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.953
With these numbers,
you got room everywhere.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.664
Sir, if I can get you $7,000 for your car

13:09.747 --> 13:12.583
and you put 11 down and I get
your payments to only 990 a month,

13:12.667 --> 13:14.752
we'd have a deal right now, right?

13:18.172 --> 13:20.633
Then shut the fuck up.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.261
The first one to speak loses.

13:53.624 --> 13:56.419
Are you crazy?

13:56.502 --> 13:59.047
No matter what the customer says,
you go right to the trade.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.923
Always in control.

14:01.007 --> 14:04.260
"Sir, what if I can get you
7,100 for your car?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.970
Then we'd have a deal, right?

14:06.054 --> 14:07.930
How 'bout 7,200?"

14:08.014 --> 14:09.682
Always nod yes. Keeping nodding.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.934
All of a sudden,
the asshole starts to nod.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.936
"Sir,

14:14.020 --> 14:15.855
did you know you are getting fucked?"

14:15.938 --> 14:17.899
"Yes, I know, Reggie."

14:17.982 --> 14:20.943
"Does it feel good?"

14:22.362 --> 14:25.114
"Yes, it does, Reggie."

14:25.198 --> 14:28.576
Fuck these people up the ass!

14:28.659 --> 14:30.870
They love it!

14:32.205 --> 14:35.124
The next day,
when they come out of the ether...

14:35.208 --> 14:38.252
What the fuck did I do?

14:39.170 --> 14:43.299
What the fuck did I do?
What the fuck did I do?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.094
What the fuck did I do?

14:48.679 --> 14:51.516
Woman: Honey, are you in there?

14:51.599 --> 14:54.018
I'm taking a shower.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.292
And they don't want to admit
they got fucked,

15:00.316 --> 15:01.859
so they bring their friends to you.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.696
"Go ahead. Give them the same deal.
Go ahead. Fuck him, too."

15:05.780 --> 15:08.449
These assholes
will bring you more customers.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.009
- How much money do you have?
- $10.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.640
Hey, hey, guys. How's it going?

15:32.723 --> 15:36.436
- Hey! Where you been, man?
- Yeah, you could've called.

15:36.519 --> 15:41.315
I know. I know. I'm really sorry,
but I've been so busy, you know?

15:41.399 --> 15:44.152
How's the truckin' business, partner?

15:44.235 --> 15:46.821
It's, uh, it's fine.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.490
But, uh, listen.

15:49.574 --> 15:52.869
I got some other things going on that
I think you guys are really gonna love.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.496
What we'd love is for you
to make your payments on time.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.166
And according to my sundial,
you're late, Nixon.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.251
Well, that's why I'm here.

16:00.334 --> 16:04.213
I, uh...
I need a little bit of an extension.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.341
Wait a minute. Don't get me wrong here.
I mean, things are going great.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.218
I mean, they're definitely getting better.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.013
- Yeah, I bet they are.
- They are. They are.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.724
Check out the new ride.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.227
Hey, hey! Very nice.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.771
Why should we give you an extension?

16:20.855 --> 16:22.857
So I can close a few deals.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.277
A little breathing room, that's all.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.321
And, I guarantee you,
by the end of this month,

16:28.404 --> 16:29.947
I can be totally up to date.

16:30.031 --> 16:31.866
I mean, come on, guys.
Is that cool?

16:38.581 --> 16:42.710
When he says yes to the trade,
go right to the down payment.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.671
"Is that $11,000 down payment
gonna be cash or check?

16:45.755 --> 16:47.590
You can't?

16:47.673 --> 16:50.259
Well, what if I can get them to go

16:50.343 --> 16:53.679
to 10,900?"

16:53.763 --> 16:56.265
"Then we'd have a deal, right? No?"

16:56.349 --> 16:58.893
Cross it out. Big "."X

16:58.976 --> 17:01.187
"how 'bout 10,800?
Then we'd have a deal, right?"

17:01.270 --> 17:04.732
"No?" big "x."

17:04.815 --> 17:07.527
"Sir, normally the banks
require one-third.

17:07.610 --> 17:12.031
But if I can get them to take 10,750,
then we'd have a deal, right?"

17:13.616 --> 17:15.451
"No?"

17:15.535 --> 17:18.329
Sir, what would it take
to make a deal right now?

17:18.412 --> 17:20.957
Uh, $5,000?

17:21.040 --> 17:24.502
Okay, 5,000 now, and when will you
bring us the other 6,000?

17:26.045 --> 17:31.133
- What do you mean?
- Oh, you mean only 5,000?

17:31.217 --> 17:33.427
Well, then your payment's gonna go up.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.930
You're always in control.
Go back to the trade.

17:36.013 --> 17:40.059
If I can get you 7,250 for your trade,
you write me a check for 5,000,

17:40.142 --> 17:42.728
and I keep your payments
down to 990 a month,

17:42.812 --> 17:45.022
we'd have a deal right now, right?

17:45.106 --> 17:48.401
- No. Payment's too high.
- Well, let me ask you,

17:48.484 --> 17:50.528
how close to this figure of 990
can you come?

17:53.656 --> 17:55.992
Maybe 400, 500.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.495
500?

17:59.579 --> 18:02.290
That's low.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.252
I've never seen a deal
go down like this before.

18:07.753 --> 18:12.258
But if I could do that for you,
would we have a deal right now?

18:16.304 --> 18:18.639
Okay.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.600
Sign here.

18:22.393 --> 18:25.479
I'm gonna try for you,
but my boss is gonna kill me.

18:25.563 --> 18:29.025
Then you say, "wish me luck."

18:29.108 --> 18:32.695
The guy's shitting in his pants.
He's fucking shaking.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.205
I hope he can get it.

18:44.415 --> 18:48.002
So you bump this guy up
thousands of dollars.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.713
Then you come in
and you get your closer.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.716
We have these stars here for a reason.
They are the best.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.861
But you have to do your job
before they can do theirs.

18:55.885 --> 19:00.222
You sell the car, not them.
They close the deal.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.434
When you pick up a girl,
you don't take off all her clothes,

19:03.517 --> 19:05.895
get her into bed,
and then call you friend Tom

19:05.978 --> 19:08.773
and say, "okay, Tom.
She's ready now. You can fuck her."

19:08.856 --> 19:11.525
No. No.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.737
You're fucking the bitch,
the closer comes in,

19:14.820 --> 19:18.491
he puts his foot on your ass
and pushes you in deeper!

19:21.327 --> 19:25.414
You have to sell the car.
You have to get a commitment.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.501
Then one of my stars goes in,
switches the guy to a lease,

19:28.584 --> 19:31.003
and buries the motherfucker!

19:32.588 --> 19:35.174
- We... are... the... best!
- All: Yeah!

19:35.257 --> 19:37.677
We make more money than anybody!

19:37.760 --> 19:41.889
We are fucking high gross!

19:41.972 --> 19:43.349
All: Yeah!

19:43.432 --> 19:45.810
And this is gonna be
our biggest month ever.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.104
- Yeah!
- And to sweeten the pot...

19:49.772 --> 19:53.150
A $10,000 bonus to the top man!

19:53.234 --> 19:56.862
That's right, a ten-pounder to the pro.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.907
Now, next month,
we got all new inventory.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.576
So get rid of those
fucking sleds out there.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.121
Come on, let's go kick some ass!

20:05.204 --> 20:06.497
All right!

20:24.390 --> 20:26.660
Woman on P.A.: Parts department,
please call the operator.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.894
Parts department, call the operator.

20:31.522 --> 20:34.984

20:35.067 --> 20:37.570
Buddy morra to
the service department, please.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.739
Your car is ready, again.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.622
What?

20:48.706 --> 20:50.541
He doesn't speak a word of Spanish.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.626
Can you believe it,
a Mexican from la?

20:52.710 --> 20:54.420
Coming in car, right there.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.008
Nice call, man. That's the owner.
You think you can sell him a car?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.485
Woman on P.A.: Eddie, please dial

21:00.509 --> 21:02.762
the operator, Eddie, dial the operator.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.620
Don't ever talk to Mr. Carlton.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.289
He doesn't like it. You'll get fired.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.883
Man on P.A.:
Reggie, please see Mr. Carlton.

21:40.966 --> 21:44.053
Reggie, see Mr. Carlton right now.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.599
What the fuck are you doing?

21:48.682 --> 21:51.268
You put it closer... closer.

21:51.352 --> 21:54.396
You see how much pain you can stand.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.816
You are sick.

21:56.899 --> 22:00.069
Let's see how much pain
a q-tip can stand.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.905
Fuck you.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.366
Woman on P.A.: Sales, line one, please.

22:05.449 --> 22:08.452
- Sales, line one.
- Good afternoon. Southside motors.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.830
Sure, we do. Come on down.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.958
And, uh, ask for jj, okay?

22:14.041 --> 22:16.168
That's spelled "jj".

22:16.252 --> 22:18.838
Yeah, okay.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.965
Well, uh, I'll see you soon.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.300
Buh-bye.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.556
Hey, mo.

22:31.475 --> 22:35.479
You ever catch a ladybug
and melt the wings off?

22:36.605 --> 22:40.943
Then you pull all the legs off one side

22:41.026 --> 22:43.946
and watch it run around in circles?

22:44.029 --> 22:46.740
You must be very sick to get pleasure
from killing something.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.076
Oh, no, no, no. You don't kill it.

22:50.494 --> 22:53.581
Aren't you gonna ask
why you don't kill it?

22:53.664 --> 22:55.457
Because then it'll rain.

22:55.541 --> 22:59.253
Woman on P.A.: Randall, dial 6-4, please.

22:59.336 --> 23:03.257
You fucking Israelis don't know shit.
You people worship fucking cows.

23:03.340 --> 23:07.553
Man, what the fuck is that?

23:07.636 --> 23:10.931
Get the fuck out of that chair,
you mother grabber!

23:11.015 --> 23:12.975
Relax, q-tip,
before I pull one of your legs off.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.103
Back off, jj. Take it easy, mo.

23:16.186 --> 23:19.607
This subhuman doesn't know the difference
between Israel and Afghanistan.

23:19.690 --> 23:21.490
Hey, you're all just sand niggas
to me anyway.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.295
Fucking nut!

23:23.319 --> 23:25.905
We're on the same team, moron. Fuck.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.452
Are you crazy? You never mess
with a fuckin' Afghanistan commando.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.954
Fuck that skinny nigga.
I'll SWAT his ass.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.789
I don't think so.
Guy's a trained killer.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.893
- He'll kill you in the blink of an eye.
- My money's on jj.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.461
- He was trained in watts.
- Jj: You know that's right.

23:40.544 --> 23:44.089
How much? 500?

23:45.925 --> 23:48.218
Punk ass nigga.

23:51.430 --> 23:55.225
Woman on P.A.: Sales, line three, please.
Sales, line three.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.562
Good afternoon. Southside.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.940
- Coming in!
- Coming in.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.067
Damn. Shit. You prick.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.568
I saw it first.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.531
- Hi. I'm Marco.
- Oh, I forgot my purse.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.663
Look at her.

24:17.665 --> 24:19.291
Aw, man, she knows we're watching.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.419
- I'm Marco. Welcome to southside.
- Nice to meet you, Marco.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.588
I'm looking for something
to get around in.

24:24.672 --> 24:26.757
Something sporty.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.718
Oh, mami.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.014
What do you think of this new guy
on your team?

24:34.098 --> 24:36.558
I think he's gonna help me
kick your ass this month.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.978
- That's what I think.
- Bullshit.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.854
20 bucks says he goes blank
for the weekend.

24:40.938 --> 24:43.691
50 bucks says he sells a car today,
white bread.

24:43.774 --> 24:46.151
- Come on, bubba.
- 50?

24:46.235 --> 24:49.321
- Put up or shut up.
- I'm good for it.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.699
Yeah, and my dick
tastes like strawberries.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.909
You good for it...
Put up your money.

24:55.536 --> 24:58.080
- Here you go, ma'am.
- No, you drive.

24:58.163 --> 25:00.183
- I hate to drive.
- Woman on P.A.: Reggie, please dial

25:00.207 --> 25:03.043
the operator.
Reggie, dial the operator, please.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.754
Don't take your eyes off that entrance.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.382
You see a car, you scream "coming in."

25:08.465 --> 25:10.968
- Where?
- Up your ass, Sean.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.178
Yell as loud as you can.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.264
- Both: Coming in!
- I got it.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.557
- Damn!
- Your ass you got it.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.868
- He beat you by a mile.
- Fuck you, Eddie, that's Sean's up.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.936
Get the commitment.
I'll Bury the maggot. Go.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.123
- What the hell is that?
- What the hell it look like, buddy?

25:23.147 --> 25:24.815
- Oh, man.
- Shit, that was you gettin' it

25:24.898 --> 25:26.618
- in the Booty, Judy.
- Damn right.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.611
- That's not fucking fair, man.
- Oh, we're not fair.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.905
Fuck all y'all, how 'bout that?
Go on, boy.

25:31.989 --> 25:33.907
Hey! How you doing today?

25:33.991 --> 25:37.619
Hi. Welcome to southside.
Can I help you with anything?

25:37.703 --> 25:40.289
Well, we just wanted to look.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.250
That's great.
What can I help you look at?

25:43.333 --> 25:45.669
You know what?
We're really just looking right now.

25:45.753 --> 25:48.589
Okay. I'll tell you what,
if you need any help,

25:48.672 --> 25:51.091
I'll be right over here, okay?

25:51.175 --> 25:53.343
Okay.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.447
Let's go look at that one over there.

25:55.471 --> 25:57.671
Listen, no matter
what anybody says, we're just looking.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.144
Welcome to southside.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.189
- My name is shamim.
- I already have a salesman.

26:05.272 --> 26:08.567
- Spoke to Sean.
- Oh.

26:13.197 --> 26:16.617
- Would you like to, uh, drive now?
- No, I'm fine.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.869
Go up there.

26:24.917 --> 26:28.003
I think you'll like this model.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.756
I better like it,
you big fucking carrot.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.802
Woman on P.A.:
Roscoe topanga, your car is ready.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.428
Roscoe topanga,
please pick up your car

26:36.512 --> 26:38.305
- at the service lot.
- What are you doing?

26:38.388 --> 26:41.517
- Why aren't you with the customers?
- They said they were just looking.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.286
Get the keys to that car
and get out there and drive them.

26:43.310 --> 26:44.871
It's only the first one
they've looked at.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.815
Get out there and drive them now.

26:47.898 --> 26:50.442
- Keys in here?
- Fuck.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.155
I used to know kids like you
in school.

26:55.239 --> 26:58.343
We used to hold them by the legs and clean
the toilets with their fucking heads.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.952
That's brilliant.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.835
Probably did your homework
before supper, huh?

27:01.870 --> 27:04.998
- Can we just get to the garage, please?
- You're gonna get to the garage.

27:05.082 --> 27:07.459
Get to the garage. Just shut the fuck up.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.755
I wonder if the airbag is standard.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.924
It better be at this price.

27:15.092 --> 27:18.595
Hey. This is a great car.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.973
Really. Let's go for a drive.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.684
Mm, no thanks.
We don't wanna waste your time.

27:23.767 --> 27:26.353
Nah, it's all right.
I have nothing better to do.

27:27.437 --> 27:29.064
Listen, you don't have to buy the car.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.608
I mean, come on.
Let's go for a little drive.

27:31.692 --> 27:35.028
It might help you decide
you don't want the car.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.573
Come on.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.784
- All right.
- Okay.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.378
Woman: Pull up here and park.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.972
Isn't this great?

28:03.015 --> 28:04.766
Yeah.

28:04.850 --> 28:07.519
Um, what are you doing?

28:07.603 --> 28:09.897
I don't know what you're doing,

28:09.980 --> 28:12.608
but I know what I'm doing.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.569
Mm. Relax, honey.

28:15.652 --> 28:18.238
I've been dreaming about doing this

28:18.322 --> 28:20.866
since my daddy bought me my first car.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.837
Oh, yeah.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.423
Wasn't that great? Huh?

28:36.506 --> 28:38.467
Thank you.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.970
So, Bobby, what kind of deal
can we get on this?

28:43.639 --> 28:47.100
Uh, I don't know.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.853
But I could find out.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.022
Follow me.

29:21.468 --> 29:25.389
Hey. Okay.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.016
Why don't the two of you
come into my office, take a seat,

29:28.100 --> 29:30.435
and I'll be back in just a little bit.

29:30.519 --> 29:33.105
Okay? Please.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.528
Eddie, Eddie. Hey, Eddie.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.364
I, uh, I think I got a deal.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.909
- Take a credit app, worksheet.
- Okay.

29:45.993 --> 29:49.746
It was great, you know, it was great.
I mean, I said, "follow me," they did.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.790
Fuckin' amazed me, you know?

29:51.873 --> 29:54.418
Eddie, take the customers.

29:54.501 --> 29:58.714
- He's fine.
- Eddie, work the fucking deal.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.877
There's no deal.
He hasn't even done a worksheet yet.

30:04.928 --> 30:07.806
You fill it out. Ask them the questions.

30:07.889 --> 30:12.019
Go high on payment,
high on down payment, low on trade.

30:12.102 --> 30:14.813
I, uh, I don't know if they have a trade.

30:14.896 --> 30:18.650
- Then go real low.
- Okay.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.698
- You're an asshole.
- He's gotta learn.

30:24.781 --> 30:28.243
If he loses that deal,
you are fired, you lazy fuck.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.081
- How much?
- Ten bucks.

30:45.469 --> 30:48.096
If you'll come inside, sir,
we can work out the numbers.

30:49.473 --> 30:52.726
Well, why don't you go inside
and get your boss's best price,

30:52.809 --> 30:55.145
and then come out here
and tell me what it is.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.773
Well, it doesn't work that way, sir.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.859
You see, I need you to come inside
and fill out the papers,

31:00.942 --> 31:03.236
or they will not believe you're serious.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.280
Oh, I'm serious.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.532
But I'm not coming inside.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.631
Are you gonna buy this car, ma'am?

31:22.714 --> 31:25.384
- I'll buy it, baby. Keep going.
- You promise?

31:25.467 --> 31:27.010
- Yes.
- You'll buy it today?

31:27.094 --> 31:29.638
Yes.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.870
Woman: Good afternoon. Southside.
Could you hold a moment?

31:35.894 --> 31:39.106
Good afternoon. Southside.
Could you hold, please?

31:39.189 --> 31:43.402
- Okay. Do you have a trade-in?
- No.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.904
Good.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.948
All right.

31:48.031 --> 31:53.954
Now, this is how much your car costs.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.624
So, your payments will be...

32:03.088 --> 32:04.928
I don't know.
What do you think they should be?

32:04.965 --> 32:07.134
Well, we're not paying
that much for the car, right?

32:07.217 --> 32:09.261
No.no.no.

32:09.344 --> 32:11.430
I'll get you a good deal. Don't worry.

32:11.513 --> 32:14.516
But what are you gonna put down?

32:14.599 --> 32:17.602
What do we have to put down?

32:17.686 --> 32:20.439
A lot.

32:31.950 --> 32:34.244
I'll be right back.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.002
This guy has no idea what he's doing.

32:42.085 --> 32:45.130
So maybe we'll get a better deal.
I like him.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.132
He's not a salesman.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.124
Did you whack this shit?

33:22.542 --> 33:24.544
- No.
- Yes, you did, man.

33:25.921 --> 33:29.633
That's okay, because that's how I started,
and that's how everybody fucking starts.

33:29.716 --> 33:32.344
I'm gonna tell you this
because I like you.

33:33.637 --> 33:36.056
Stay out of the fucking product.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.891
Okay.

33:42.062 --> 33:44.022
What do you weigh these days, Sean?

33:44.105 --> 33:46.399
- What?
- How much you weigh, man?

33:47.359 --> 33:49.611
I don't know. I guess about 160.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.530
Good.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.740
Step on that.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.957
That-a-boy.

34:07.587 --> 34:09.506
This is the sticker price.

34:09.589 --> 34:12.592
If you cannot come inside, sir,
this is the best we can do.

34:14.970 --> 34:17.722
Maybe you don't comprende, snowflake.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.601
I will buy this car,
but I refuse to come inside.

34:26.731 --> 34:29.150
I'll be waiting.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.902
Right here.

34:31.861 --> 34:34.614
We have to stop at the bank
so I can get my money.

34:34.698 --> 34:37.909
Uh, okay.

34:47.377 --> 34:50.171
Hey, wh... hey!

34:51.756 --> 34:54.175
- Where are you going?
- You were great, honey.

35:03.810 --> 35:06.605
Fuck!

35:06.688 --> 35:08.857
I'll throw you an extra 50
if you make this deal.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.318
- The guy's a iaydown. I know it.
- I don't give a shit.

35:11.401 --> 35:15.280
- I'm not talking to this asshole anymore.
- You know why he won't come inside?

35:15.363 --> 35:19.618
Because he's afraid, mo.
He's afraid of you. He's afraid of me.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.828
He's afraid of every fucking thing here.

35:21.911 --> 35:25.206
He's afraid of the fucking porters
who wash the cars.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.293
I'm done talking to this piece of shit.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.253
This pedersach has no respect.

35:30.337 --> 35:33.089
You don't want his respect!
You want his money!

35:33.173 --> 35:35.133
You can't buy shit with respect!

35:35.216 --> 35:37.056
How many of these jerks
come in here screaming,

35:37.135 --> 35:39.846
"I'm not buying anything today.
I'm just looking."

35:39.929 --> 35:43.183
You think they're talking to you?
No! They're talking to themselves.

35:43.266 --> 35:47.437
They've been fucked so many times,
they finally realize they're easy!

35:47.520 --> 35:49.981
- Go Bury this fuck!
- No.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.691
Fuck him!

35:51.775 --> 35:54.235
I take another up.
Give it to someone else.

35:54.319 --> 35:56.159
I'll give you an extra 100
you close this deal.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.822
150.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.241
Don't push your luck.

36:06.247 --> 36:10.043
Three porters to the showroom, please.
Three porters to the showroom.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.253
Show 'em this.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.650
- Hey, they're gonna shit when they...
- Just show it to them.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.693
- Yeah, but they think that I'm...
- Show it to 'em or I'll tell jj

36:17.717 --> 36:19.570
- what you said about his mother.
- I didn't say anything...

36:19.594 --> 36:21.914
Will you get the fuck over there
and show them the numbers?

36:35.485 --> 36:38.279
I thought you liked us, Bob.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.993
Let's just sit here for a little while,

36:44.077 --> 36:46.705
then I'll go back inside
and get you guys a discount.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.331
Okay?

37:00.260 --> 37:01.928
You like Vietnamese food?

37:20.739 --> 37:23.366
Have a seat, my friend.

37:23.450 --> 37:26.703
Almost done with the figures
we have worked up for you.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.956
Man on P.A.:
Javier, please dial 55-55, please.

37:30.039 --> 37:33.001
Dial 55-55, please.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.338
- What the hell is this?
- Your payments.

37:37.422 --> 37:41.050
Oh, this looks a little high.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.928
If you cannot afford this car,
thank you for stopping by.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.931
No, no. Wait, wait.
It's not that I can't afford it.

37:47.015 --> 37:51.895
It's, uh, well, I mean,
can I get a better deal?

37:53.354 --> 37:55.690
You have to go somewhere else
for a better deal.

37:55.774 --> 37:58.693
Are you kidding? These are harder
to find than tits on a catfish.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.905
- Especially in this color.
- I know. That's too bad.

38:03.490 --> 38:06.701
There was one other place
you could've gotten a better deal.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.704
- Where?
- Inside.

38:13.583 --> 38:16.294
The 1.6 liter is 9,700,
but that's wholesale.

38:16.377 --> 38:18.463
The retail is 12,100.

38:18.546 --> 38:22.133
Reggie, the guys says he'll take it
if we give him a full-size spare.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.052
Tell him they're 300,
we'll do it for 150.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.137
- Okay.
- What happened?

38:26.221 --> 38:29.307
Nothing. The guy was a total roach.
There's no deal.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.976
Then get the fuck back out on the line.

38:34.145 --> 38:37.357
- Said it's too much.
- Eddie, go talk to these fucking moochers.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.567
No, I think I can do it.
It's just a little too high.

38:39.651 --> 38:42.237
- What are they saying?
- Eddie, right now.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.991
Introduce me. Don't say a word.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.494
Hey, folks. This is my manager Eddie.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.413
- Eddie, Mr. and Mrs. Lennox.
- Hello. Pleasure to meet you.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.541
- Beautiful dress.
- Thank you.

38:54.624 --> 38:57.544
So, you folks would like
to take this car home today, huh?

38:57.627 --> 39:00.088
No, uh, we told Bobby
we were just looking.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.152
Well, let me ask you a couple of
questions. Do you like the car?

39:05.176 --> 39:06.845
- Well...
- Yes, we do.

39:06.928 --> 39:08.656
Then what's stopping you
from taking it home today?

39:08.680 --> 39:12.684
- The price.
- No, we haven't looked around very much.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.812
Ah. If the price was right,
would you take it home today?

39:15.895 --> 39:17.564
- Yes.
- No, actually,

39:17.647 --> 39:19.274
we want to look around a little more.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.317
Okay, well, let me see what I can do.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.947
Man on P.A.: Customer Jack Johnson,
we found your yellow jacket.

39:26.030 --> 39:30.118
Customer Jack Johnson,
we found your yellow jacket.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.287
You get back in there
and talk to your customers.

39:33.621 --> 39:36.916
- What are you doing?
- I like the car. I want it.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.460
Yeah, but you don't tell him that.

39:48.720 --> 39:53.099
- I think they got mad at me.
- You're doing a good job, honey.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.810
- Just get us a good deal.
- Eddie's a good guy.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.645
He'll get you a good deal.

39:59.022 --> 40:01.524
You're gonna owe me
$10 in about five minutes.

40:01.608 --> 40:04.027
Not if he doesn't close the deal.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.529
Keep 'em in order.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.365
She had a knife. What could I do?

40:09.449 --> 40:11.492
They won't believe that.

40:11.576 --> 40:14.829
She drugged me.

40:14.913 --> 40:17.248
It was a gang of bikers.

40:17.332 --> 40:20.001
Call the cops.
They kidnapped the lady.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.675
Eddie: All right, here we go.

40:27.759 --> 40:32.263
Now, on a four-year purchase,

40:32.347 --> 40:35.850
this is your down payment, and your
payments for 48 months is this right here.

40:35.934 --> 40:38.895
Yeah, but what are we actually
paying for the car?

40:38.978 --> 40:41.064
- Do you have your original worksheet?
- Right here.

40:43.691 --> 40:46.069
These numbers reflect
the sticker price of the car.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.112
As you can see,
these new ones are a lot lower.

40:49.656 --> 40:52.575
Money can only come from one place.

40:57.664 --> 40:58.957
I don't know.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.542
It's still a little more
than we were planning on.

41:01.626 --> 41:04.212
- Have you considered leasing?
- Well...

41:04.295 --> 41:07.423
This is what a four-year lease
looks like for the same vehicle.

41:07.507 --> 41:09.300
Oh. Now, that's more like it.

41:09.384 --> 41:12.512
No, that's still a little too high.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.808
Well, that's the best I can do.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.772
I tell you what.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.066
Let me talk to my boss, okay?

41:25.149 --> 41:27.610
You folks excuse us a minute?

41:27.694 --> 41:29.612
Bobby, come with me.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.286
I want this car,

41:37.370 --> 41:40.164
and that's only $30 a month more
than we thought we could spend.

41:40.248 --> 41:43.584
Will you stop? I know what I'm doing.

41:45.795 --> 41:48.006
There's no deal.

41:48.089 --> 41:50.633
The wife wants it.
Husband's gotta pay for it.

41:50.717 --> 41:53.678
- He's gonna grind me, this guy.
- You owe me ten bucks, you weak suck.

41:53.761 --> 41:56.431
- Me? I'm a weak suck? It's his deal.
- You trained him.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.308
- Yeah, and I trained him good, too.
- Then how come there's no deal?

42:00.893 --> 42:03.730
Another ten.
You close the deal, we're even.

42:03.813 --> 42:06.107
How about 25 he closes the deal himself?

42:06.190 --> 42:08.943
Fuck you, Eddie!
I don't wanna lose this deal.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.153
50 bucks?

42:11.279 --> 42:12.739
How much?

42:12.822 --> 42:16.409
Okay. A c-note.
But only if he closes the deal.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.661
100 if he closes it.
Plus the original ten.

42:18.745 --> 42:19.829
Done.

42:19.912 --> 42:22.874
Show him this, shake his hand.
The car is sold.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.001
You didn't show 'em the counter.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.046
That was better than pussy.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.800
What the hell are you laughing at,
green pea?

42:34.302 --> 42:37.055
Closed jj's iaydown.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.432
All-cash deal.

43:01.204 --> 43:05.166
Maybe if I disappear for a week
I can say I was kidnapped.

43:52.213 --> 43:53.714
Hello, Mrs. DeLuca.

43:53.798 --> 43:57.635
Did you happen to know that you are
married to a very talented salesman?

43:57.718 --> 43:59.887
- You sold a car?
- I sold a car.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.889
Honey, that's wonderful.

44:03.683 --> 44:08.020
With the money I made on this one deal,
we can pay rent.

44:08.104 --> 44:10.815
Baby, I'm gonna be great at this.

44:10.898 --> 44:13.276
I'm gonna be great
when you get home tonight.

44:16.696 --> 44:18.406
I have to work late.

44:19.866 --> 44:21.242
Well, that's okay.

44:21.325 --> 44:24.078
Gives me more time to get ready.

44:24.162 --> 44:26.247
Now go out there and sell another one.

44:26.330 --> 44:27.498
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

44:27.582 --> 44:28.666
- I'm going.
- Go.

44:28.749 --> 44:29.852
- I'm going. I'm going.
- Go.

44:29.876 --> 44:31.436
- I'll see you at home.
- Oh, one more thing.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.004
What?

44:37.300 --> 44:38.676
Hey, guys.

44:38.759 --> 44:41.470
What would you call the flintstones
if they were black?

44:41.554 --> 44:43.014
Niggers.

44:45.308 --> 44:47.935
Fuck you, you racist cock sucker.

44:48.019 --> 44:50.813
I'm not a racist. I hate everybody.

44:50.897 --> 44:54.609
You Kian-iovin', Aryan nation,
militia-membered,

44:54.692 --> 44:57.695
skinhead, white motherfucker.

44:57.778 --> 45:00.573
- No offense.
- None taken.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.909
One day there will be
no more racism on earth.

45:02.992 --> 45:05.286
- Yeah, whatever.
- Right after the aliens attack.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.622
And then we'll all hate green people.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.999
Jj: I can't believe I'm working
for that fuckin' asshole.

45:10.082 --> 45:12.210
- Why don't you quit?
- I did. Twice.

45:12.293 --> 45:14.962
Why are you still here?

45:15.046 --> 45:18.007
Money, baby, money.
This is one high-gross store.

45:18.090 --> 45:21.219
You think anywhere you go to sell cars
they fuckin' rape people like this?

45:21.302 --> 45:24.680
I once made $2,700 on one fuckin' car.

45:24.764 --> 45:28.267
That is downright motherfuckin'
legalized robbery, my friend.

45:28.351 --> 45:30.645
Sean: Look.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.814
Jj: Oh, fuck.

45:35.358 --> 45:36.817
Whoo! What's up, sexy?

45:36.901 --> 45:39.904
Where the fuck have you been?

45:39.987 --> 45:41.322
Where's the fuckin' car?

45:41.405 --> 45:43.842
You realize how many people came in
we could have sold that car to?

45:43.866 --> 45:44.867
Can we talk inside?

45:44.951 --> 45:47.203
Fuck you, asshole.
Where's the fuckin' car?

45:47.286 --> 45:50.122
- The lady stole it.
- What lady?

45:50.206 --> 45:52.333
You let some bitch steal the car?

45:52.416 --> 45:53.960
Well, uh, we were, uh...

45:54.043 --> 45:57.380
- You were what?
- Well, we had sex, and she...

45:57.463 --> 45:59.715
You fucked the bitch?

45:59.799 --> 46:01.342
Vveh, yeah.

46:02.426 --> 46:04.845
- Hey!
- Yes!

46:04.929 --> 46:08.474
Marco finally got laid!

46:08.557 --> 46:09.934
Did she swallow?

46:10.017 --> 46:12.687
Hey! He got a blowjob, too.

46:12.770 --> 46:15.898
Woman on P.A.: Marco, you have a call
on line one. Marco dial the operator.

46:15.982 --> 46:20.569
You are in deep fuckin' shit,
you stupid asshole.

46:27.493 --> 46:28.744
Hey there, partner.

46:28.828 --> 46:30.955
- Hey, Eddie.
- Good deal you made today.

46:31.038 --> 46:32.581
Hey, thanks, man. Thanks.

46:32.665 --> 46:35.751
Thinking maybe I wanna learn more
about this business, you know?

46:35.835 --> 46:38.421
This business,
you don't need to know a fuckin' thing.

46:38.504 --> 46:41.007
Just have to have the balls to do it.

46:41.090 --> 46:42.967
Is it really that easy?

46:43.050 --> 46:44.760
You shittin' me?

46:45.886 --> 46:48.472
Half the sales force
can't even speak English.

46:48.556 --> 46:50.266
That's the beauty of it.
Anybody can do it.

46:50.349 --> 46:51.892
Look at Mohammed.

46:51.976 --> 46:54.061
Brother barely escapes the Russian army.

46:54.145 --> 46:57.023
He's running through miles of ambushes,
shooting down helicopters

46:57.106 --> 46:59.150
with stinger missiles,
ends up here selling cars.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.944
How's he do it? I mean, how does he make
so much fuckin' money here?

47:02.028 --> 47:04.405
Works his fuckin' ass off, man.
That's how.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.800
He's trying to raise enough cash
to go back and get his sister.

47:06.824 --> 47:09.493
- He left her behind.
- He's a good guy, mo, you know?

47:09.577 --> 47:10.786
I like him.

47:10.870 --> 47:12.246
Fuck him!

47:12.330 --> 47:14.165
Fuck 'em all.

47:14.248 --> 47:16.751
Fuck them before they fuck you.

47:16.834 --> 47:19.503
And, believe me, they will.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.797
Come on, man.
It isn't that bad, is it?

47:21.881 --> 47:24.050
Reggie:
Let me tell you something, green pea.

47:24.133 --> 47:26.677
There is no room for loyalty
in this wacked-out business.

47:26.761 --> 47:29.472
You make your money
and to hell with everybody else.

47:29.555 --> 47:32.850
That deal Eddie closed for you,
we buried that fuck.

47:32.933 --> 47:35.662
He won't even know it till he tries
to get out three or four years from now.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.480
And you.

47:37.563 --> 47:40.232
You could have made at least
another half point on the interest.

47:40.316 --> 47:43.319
- We made enough on the deal.
- What?

47:44.153 --> 47:46.697
What did you say?
Did you say "enough"?

47:46.781 --> 47:48.300
Is that like when
you're getting your dick sucked

47:48.324 --> 47:50.659
and right before you come you say,
"that's enough"?

47:52.078 --> 47:53.746
Never!

47:53.829 --> 47:56.582
It's never enough!

47:56.665 --> 47:59.543
I wanna blow my load all over the place,

47:59.627 --> 48:03.255
and when I'm done,
I wanna do it all over again.

48:12.348 --> 48:15.059
Man, oh, man.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.895
Let me ask you something, Eddie.

48:17.978 --> 48:20.314
Do you ever feel bad
for any of your customers?

48:21.649 --> 48:23.859
Fuck 'em.

48:23.943 --> 48:25.694
Let's go home, man.

48:41.752 --> 48:43.879
I can't believe you're still up.

49:01.063 --> 49:02.731
You know...

49:04.150 --> 49:06.652
I've been thinking a lot about this job.

49:09.405 --> 49:11.699
Maybe I've been too nice to people,

49:11.782 --> 49:13.576
people I should have stepped on a little.

49:13.659 --> 49:17.163
And it would have put me
in a much better position.

49:17.246 --> 49:20.749
But I didn't because...

49:20.833 --> 49:24.044
I'm a nice guy.

49:25.421 --> 49:30.843
And every single time, it's come
right back and bit me on the ass.

49:37.766 --> 49:40.227
How'd you like to bite this ass?

49:42.813 --> 49:44.732
God, I love you.

50:14.678 --> 50:17.181
Reggie: Marco, good news!

50:17.264 --> 50:20.017
The cops found the car
and busted your girlfriend.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.144
The bitch is in jail.

50:22.228 --> 50:23.979
Are you going to visit her in jail, Marco?

50:25.356 --> 50:27.566
Hey, maybe you can get laid again.

50:27.650 --> 50:29.044
Better make sure you go
to a woman's jail.

50:29.068 --> 50:31.695
Why? He can get laid
at a men's jail too, right?

50:31.779 --> 50:33.656
Where's Sean?
I'm gonna kill that Irish fuck.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.884
- How did they find the car?
- Reggie: Oh, this is a good one.

50:35.908 --> 50:37.117
She's a degenerate gambler.

50:37.201 --> 50:39.745
Took the car to Vegas.
Guess what? The bitch won.

50:41.455 --> 50:43.099
What fuckin' time are my meetings,
asshole?

50:43.123 --> 50:44.875
I got a note from my doctor.

50:47.294 --> 50:50.422
"Removed moth from right ear"?

50:53.259 --> 50:54.611
You had a bug living in your head?

50:54.635 --> 50:57.304
It crawled in there.
What was I supposed to do?

50:57.388 --> 51:00.307
Go sit next to Marco.
That's my new genius squad.

51:01.892 --> 51:04.270
Okay, we gotta pick up the pace.

51:04.353 --> 51:06.957
You guys should be doing a lot better.
You're letting too many customers walk.

51:06.981 --> 51:08.291
I wanna hear some of their excuses.

51:08.315 --> 51:10.335
Come on, try and stump me.
I got an answer for anything.

51:10.359 --> 51:11.569
Come on!

51:11.652 --> 51:13.529
- "I'm just looking."
- "I'm just selling."

51:13.612 --> 51:16.323
"Can't really look at a car
unless you drive it." Next?

51:16.407 --> 51:17.926
"I think I can get a better deal
somewhere else."

51:17.950 --> 51:19.827
"Sir, we all pay the same for the cars.

51:19.910 --> 51:21.096
Nobody can give you a better deal.

51:21.120 --> 51:23.497
Come inside and I'll show you."

51:23.581 --> 51:24.891
"This is the first place I've been to."

51:24.915 --> 51:26.768
"Then you're lucky you came
to the best place first."

51:26.792 --> 51:28.937
"I have to see what kinda interest rate
my credit union can give me."

51:28.961 --> 51:31.171
"We have a book
that lists all the credit unions.

51:31.255 --> 51:33.382
I can tell you what your rate
and payments will be."

51:33.465 --> 51:36.218
- Come on! Give me a tough one!
- "I have to check with my wife."

51:36.302 --> 51:38.029
"What's the phone number?
We'll call her right now."

51:38.053 --> 51:39.698
"I have to look
at a couple other cars first."

51:39.722 --> 51:42.600
"Why? Consumer reports,
car and driver, AAA,

51:42.683 --> 51:44.202
they've all looked
at the other cars for you.

51:44.226 --> 51:45.811
They say this one's the best!"

51:45.894 --> 51:47.605
"I want to look at a Ford."

51:47.688 --> 51:49.273
"Okay, sir. Come on."

51:49.356 --> 51:51.191
Drag the fuckin' guy with you.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.484
"Where are we going?"

51:52.568 --> 51:55.654
"To the Ford dealer down the street,
asshole. Come on!

51:55.738 --> 51:57.323
We'll compare 'em side by side!"

51:57.406 --> 51:58.699
"I don't have good credit."

51:58.782 --> 52:00.743
"We can finance anybody."

52:00.826 --> 52:02.620
"I just declared bankruptcy
two weeks ago."

52:02.703 --> 52:04.413
"Then what the fuck are you doing here?!"

52:07.458 --> 52:09.293
Okay. You get the idea.

52:09.376 --> 52:10.544
Let's sell some metal.

52:10.628 --> 52:12.921
I want credit apps.
I want full write-ups.

52:13.005 --> 52:14.381
I want commitments.

52:14.465 --> 52:16.550
I'm buying lunch for the guy
with the first deal.

52:16.634 --> 52:18.761
Let's go!

52:18.844 --> 52:21.013
Jj: Let's go kick some ass, baby.

52:25.559 --> 52:26.977
Let me show you something.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.898
So that's where he got the new car.

52:30.981 --> 52:33.317
He's playing with us.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.943
This is my sister.

52:35.027 --> 52:37.946
Her name farah,
but I call her farah joon.

52:38.030 --> 52:40.908
When you like someone, you say "joon."
Like Bobby... Bobby joon.

52:40.991 --> 52:43.243
I've saved almost enough
to bring her over here.

52:43.327 --> 52:44.828
I should have never left her there.

52:44.912 --> 52:47.472
I'm sure you'll do it, mo.
I mean, you're the top man this month.

52:47.498 --> 52:49.583
So far.

52:49.667 --> 52:52.228
But you better watch out, partner,
'cause I'm comin' right up behind ya.

52:52.252 --> 52:54.171
Know what I'm saying?

52:54.254 --> 52:56.507
- Oh! Oh!
- Coming in. Thunderbird.

53:04.556 --> 53:07.434
Welcome to southside.
I am Mohammed.

53:09.019 --> 53:11.438
- Welcome to...
- Yeah, we have a salesman.

53:15.109 --> 53:16.944
You lied to us, Nixon.

53:17.027 --> 53:19.780
- I, uh...
- Woman on P.A.: Bobby, call on line one.

53:19.863 --> 53:22.324
- Bobby, line one, please.
- I was... aah!

53:23.367 --> 53:24.535
There you go again.

53:24.618 --> 53:26.995
Setting off the lie detector.

53:27.079 --> 53:29.123
I didn't say anything.

53:29.206 --> 53:31.333
That's the amazing thing
about this machine.

53:31.417 --> 53:33.585
It can tell if you even think a lie.

53:33.669 --> 53:35.754
Where's our fucking money?

53:35.838 --> 53:37.923
I have it. Aah!

53:38.006 --> 53:41.969
All right, I don't have it now,
but I can make the payments.

53:44.012 --> 53:47.099
If you only pay the vig,
you'll never get out from under.

53:47.182 --> 53:51.145
And now that we know we can't trust you,
we want it all.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.897
I can get it.

53:53.981 --> 53:56.108
This finger is gonna start breakin'.

53:56.191 --> 53:59.987
Shit! I can get it!
I can get it. I can get it.

54:00.070 --> 54:02.656
Uh, let's... let's go for a walk.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.832
You think I'm bullshitting you guys?

54:11.915 --> 54:14.585
I was workin' hard. I was makin' money.

54:14.668 --> 54:18.130
Things were going better than I thought
they would, you know?

54:18.213 --> 54:20.466
I even had a house picked out.

54:20.549 --> 54:23.302
Man on P.A.: Larry brezner,
please come to the parts department.

54:23.385 --> 54:26.346
Some nights I even slept in the truck
to get early pickups.

54:26.430 --> 54:28.849
And I was living on coffee
and fuckin' doughnuts.

54:28.932 --> 54:31.685
- It was the coffee that screwed me.
- Coffee?

54:31.769 --> 54:35.939
Yeah, you know, you're drinking so much
and you don't wanna stop driving.

54:36.023 --> 54:38.650
I was pissing in a big gulp
and I hit a pothole,

54:38.734 --> 54:41.862
and piss went all over the place,
and I smashed into another car.

54:43.489 --> 54:47.785
Did you hear this?
He pissed all over himself.

54:47.868 --> 54:52.206
I don't care what's already happened.
I just wanna know what's gonna happen.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.833
Okay, at the rate I'm selling cars,

54:54.917 --> 54:58.378
if I can make this bonus,
which I will make this bonus,

54:58.462 --> 55:02.257
I can pay you guys your 20 grand
at the end of the month guaranteed.

55:02.341 --> 55:05.135
And that'll bring me up to date
and then some. What do you say?

55:05.219 --> 55:08.222
20? On the 30th?

55:08.305 --> 55:10.224
We'll think about it.

55:20.692 --> 55:22.253
Jj: Give it to me. Come on.
Give it to me.

55:22.277 --> 55:23.821
Come on. Give it to me. Yeah.

55:23.904 --> 55:26.198
Come on, what's my name?
What's my name? Talk to me.

55:26.281 --> 55:28.450
- Talk to me, huh? What's my name?
- Jj.

55:28.534 --> 55:31.453
Talk to me, huh? Come on.
Give it to me, baby. Come on.

55:31.537 --> 55:33.705
Give it to me. Give it to me.

55:34.873 --> 55:36.875
Oh, fuck. Somebody's coming.

56:11.952 --> 56:14.454
How did jj pass me?

56:14.538 --> 56:16.790
He can't even close a screen door.

56:16.874 --> 56:18.959
He must have soaked that deal
late last night, man.

56:19.877 --> 56:21.712
Okay.

56:21.795 --> 56:23.922
Sit down. Let's get started.

56:25.340 --> 56:28.594
That was our white trash irishman
calling in from jail again.

56:28.677 --> 56:32.264
He's the only salesman I know
who calls in arrested.

56:32.347 --> 56:34.182
- What happened?
- Cops pulled him over

56:34.266 --> 56:36.268
doing 75 in a 35 zone.

56:36.351 --> 56:39.187
Found a couple of grams of coke
in his glove box.

56:40.355 --> 56:42.316
Gotta get rid of that fuckin' idiot.

56:44.109 --> 56:46.904
Okay. Okay, let's get started.

56:46.987 --> 56:50.866
I wanna talk about how to really
put somebody together.

56:50.949 --> 56:52.868
It takes faith.

56:52.951 --> 56:55.454
You have to believe.

56:55.537 --> 56:58.248
You have to be a believer.

56:58.332 --> 57:01.126
Jj, I can heal you.

57:01.209 --> 57:03.921
You are now... white!

57:04.004 --> 57:05.631
Fuck off.

57:05.714 --> 57:08.342
You baby-new-year-iookin' motherfucker.

57:08.425 --> 57:10.194
Reggie: All right, all right, all right.
Okay, okay.

57:10.218 --> 57:11.303
Remember this.

57:11.386 --> 57:14.222
People love to talk about themselves.

57:14.306 --> 57:18.518
Use that. If they have children,
tell them how safe this car is.

57:18.602 --> 57:22.230
If it's a single guy,
tell him how much power this car has,

57:22.314 --> 57:24.232
and that this car
will get his dick sucked.

57:24.316 --> 57:27.069
Any idea the customer has, you love it.

57:27.152 --> 57:29.655
If they hate somebody,
you hate them, too.

57:31.281 --> 57:34.284
You guys are the best.
You have to believe that.

57:34.368 --> 57:37.037
If you don't believe it, fake it.

57:37.120 --> 57:39.498
Fake it till you make it.

57:39.581 --> 57:43.168
Now, these numbers,
they don't mean a thing.

57:43.251 --> 57:47.547
A guy at the bottom
can go from zero to hero in a day.

57:47.631 --> 57:49.049
Look at DeLuca.

57:49.132 --> 57:51.259
Guy never sold fuckin' cars in his life.

57:51.343 --> 57:53.011
He's in the top four.

57:53.095 --> 57:55.847
Go a little crazy. Be creative.

57:55.931 --> 57:58.225
We used to take the trade-in keys,
throw 'em on the roof.

57:58.308 --> 58:01.979
"Sir, you are not leaving today
without buying a car."

58:02.062 --> 58:03.814
We used to drive the trades out back,

58:03.897 --> 58:06.024
put the bumper up against a tree,
burn out the clutch.

58:06.108 --> 58:08.735
"Sir, where the fuck are you going?

58:08.819 --> 58:10.237
Your car is broken.

58:10.320 --> 58:14.825
We could fix it, or you could use
the money as a down payment

58:14.908 --> 58:16.493
for something newer."

58:16.576 --> 58:19.705
Go crazy! Sell some fuckin' cars!

58:19.788 --> 58:21.248
Go!

58:21.331 --> 58:22.332
- Let's go!
- Come on.

58:24.126 --> 58:25.836
Come on, man. Chill out, jj.

58:25.919 --> 58:28.130
Come on, let's make some money, buddy.

58:32.426 --> 58:34.261
It's me.

58:34.344 --> 58:36.138
We got a little problem.

58:36.221 --> 58:38.223
Mr. Garcia, let me ask you,

58:38.306 --> 58:40.517
if I could get you $1,000
for your used car,

58:40.600 --> 58:44.146
you'd give me a check for $4,000,

58:44.229 --> 58:48.400
making your monthly payments
460 per month, right?

58:48.483 --> 58:50.610
Come on.

58:52.404 --> 58:55.240
- What's so funny?
- The price is too much.

58:55.323 --> 58:57.034
Okay, let's take the trade.

58:57.117 --> 58:59.453
If I can get them to give you
1,100 for the trade,

58:59.536 --> 59:01.163
then we'd have a deal, right?

59:01.246 --> 59:03.457
I really personally like
the moonlight blue,

59:03.540 --> 59:05.542
but, you know,
you can make up your own mind.

59:05.625 --> 59:07.377
Woman on P.A.:
Mohammad, line seven please.

59:07.461 --> 59:10.714
- Mohammed, line seven.
- Uh, excuse me, please.

59:11.715 --> 59:14.676
Yes, this is Mohammed.
Who is speaking, please?

59:22.893 --> 59:25.353
I'm gonna go real low on the down.

59:25.437 --> 59:27.689
-3,900.

59:27.773 --> 59:29.399
Okay, 3,800.

59:31.777 --> 59:33.153
3,750?

59:33.236 --> 59:38.033
Sir, this is a very good price.

59:38.116 --> 59:39.868
You agree?

59:39.951 --> 59:41.203
Yes.

59:43.205 --> 59:47.000
Okay, so you will take it at this price?

59:47.084 --> 59:49.419
Yes.

59:49.503 --> 59:51.546
Discount, yes?

59:51.630 --> 59:56.218
No, no, I've already given you
the discount, remember?

1:00:05.727 --> 1:00:07.979
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1:00:08.063 --> 1:00:10.982
My bad. Yes. Yes.

1:00:11.066 --> 1:00:13.235
So we have a deal, then.

1:00:17.030 --> 1:00:19.241
Bigger discount.

1:00:24.579 --> 1:00:26.832
Son of a bitch!

1:00:30.752 --> 1:00:32.963
Man, is he pissed.

1:00:33.046 --> 1:00:35.382
Thank goodness for pat morita.

1:00:35.465 --> 1:00:37.092
Man: I think his head's gonna explode.

1:00:37.175 --> 1:00:38.611
Oh, man, you were good.

1:00:38.635 --> 1:00:39.678
Woman: Oh!

1:00:43.014 --> 1:00:46.309
Man: Look, I think if we can get him to
come down another $500,

1:00:46.393 --> 1:00:47.811
- we'll take it.
- Yeah.

1:00:47.894 --> 1:00:50.147
Man: Okay.

1:00:50.230 --> 1:00:53.441
Okay, great. Sign here.

1:00:53.525 --> 1:00:56.278
I'm not saying I can do this,
but I like you,

1:00:56.361 --> 1:00:58.113
so I'm gonna give it a shot.

1:00:59.698 --> 1:01:01.992
By the way,
have you considered leasing?

1:01:02.075 --> 1:01:04.494
Can we go 325 for 36 months?

1:01:04.578 --> 1:01:06.246
Reggie: Done deal. Shake his hand.

1:01:06.329 --> 1:01:08.915
Okay, boss. I got him. Give me a lease.

1:01:08.999 --> 1:01:13.170
800 for the trade, 3,750 down,
450 a month, hmm?

1:01:13.253 --> 1:01:16.256
Good job, Bobby.
You are one sick individual.

1:01:16.339 --> 1:01:18.383
Mm-hmm.

1:01:18.466 --> 1:01:21.261
See? That is control.
That is total control.

1:01:21.344 --> 1:01:23.263
You have to be fearless!

1:01:23.346 --> 1:01:25.366
If this guy ever took the time
to add up the numbers,

1:01:25.390 --> 1:01:27.243
he'd find out he's paying
almost twice the sticker price.

1:01:27.267 --> 1:01:29.269
And he is fucking thrilled!

1:01:31.396 --> 1:01:35.233
Yo, mo, I just made
an unbelievable deal, man.

1:01:35.317 --> 1:01:37.569
It was one of the biggest
commissions this month.

1:01:37.652 --> 1:01:39.154
Yeah!

1:01:44.784 --> 1:01:46.995
She's gone, Bobby.

1:01:48.038 --> 1:01:50.373
Who? Your customer? Who's gone?

1:01:50.457 --> 1:01:52.334
My sister.

1:01:52.417 --> 1:01:53.835
Farah.

1:01:53.919 --> 1:01:56.755
She's dead.

1:01:56.838 --> 1:01:59.382
Oh, mo. Oh, man.

1:01:59.466 --> 1:02:01.801
Mo, I'm... I'm so sorry, man.

1:02:01.885 --> 1:02:05.597
It's my fault.
I should have never left her there.

1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:07.641
Bobby, it's my fault.

1:02:09.684 --> 1:02:12.229
No, mo...

1:02:12.312 --> 1:02:15.398
Mo, you... you can't do that to yourself.

1:02:15.482 --> 1:02:18.318
It's not your fault.
You couldn't have done anything.

1:02:22.697 --> 1:02:24.991
Oh, mo.

1:02:44.344 --> 1:02:46.596
- Partner.
- Shit!

1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:48.098
You scared the piss out of me.

1:02:48.181 --> 1:02:50.183
I knew we should have brought a big gulp.

1:02:50.267 --> 1:02:52.185
Chad: You know, partner,
we've been thinking.

1:02:52.269 --> 1:02:55.563
Your chances of paying us off
aren't looking too good right now.

1:02:55.647 --> 1:02:57.959
Now, listen to me, I'm being
totally straight with you guys.

1:02:57.983 --> 1:03:00.068
I have a really good chance
of nailing this bonus.

1:03:00.151 --> 1:03:01.695
No. You listen.

1:03:01.778 --> 1:03:04.072
We already gave you a chance,
and you know what?

1:03:04.155 --> 1:03:05.782
Most people only get one.

1:03:05.865 --> 1:03:07.242
We want the combination.

1:03:07.325 --> 1:03:09.077
- Pumpkin seed?
- No.

1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:12.914
- What combination?
- Don't fuck with me when I'm thirsty!

1:03:14.416 --> 1:03:18.461
The safe.
I saw money going in the safe.

1:03:18.545 --> 1:03:22.173
- How am I supposed to...
- Get in the fuckin' thing!

1:03:22.257 --> 1:03:24.634
Bobby, does your little girl
like pumpkin seeds?

1:03:24.718 --> 1:03:26.845
You motherfucker.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:34.894
That hurt?

1:03:34.978 --> 1:03:36.938
Looks like it really hurt.

1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:40.400
He hasn't done that to me in a long time,

1:03:40.483 --> 1:03:43.695
but when he did,
I remember it really hurt.

1:03:45.530 --> 1:03:47.741
By tomorrow, partner.

1:03:56.082 --> 1:03:57.709
Oh, come on, I told you guys.

1:03:57.792 --> 1:04:01.171
I told you I will have the money
by the end of the month. I...

1:04:01.254 --> 1:04:02.839
What does that mean?

1:04:02.922 --> 1:04:05.550
I don't owe that money anymore.
What do you mean?

1:04:08.928 --> 1:04:10.513
No, no.

1:04:11.973 --> 1:04:13.975
No, no, wait...

1:04:14.059 --> 1:04:16.144
Okay. Okay, okay.

1:04:16.227 --> 1:04:18.104
Just give me a couple of days.

1:04:18.188 --> 1:04:20.940
No, I said I'll do it.
I just need a little time.

1:04:21.024 --> 1:04:23.526
I gotta go. I gotta go.
I got customers. I gotta go.

1:04:23.610 --> 1:04:25.737
I'll call you back.

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:28.406
Mr. Garcia. Hello. Hi.

1:04:28.490 --> 1:04:31.701
How are you?
Can I help you with something, sir?

1:04:31.785 --> 1:04:35.080
We went to our credit union.

1:04:35.163 --> 1:04:38.458
They explained to me
that if I buy this car,

1:04:38.541 --> 1:04:41.002
I cannot afford to feed my family.

1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:44.839
Please, Mr. DeLuca, can we give it back?

1:04:52.764 --> 1:04:54.724
Oh, no.

1:04:54.808 --> 1:04:57.936
Mr. Garcia: Mr. DeLuca, please.

1:04:58.019 --> 1:05:00.647
Could you please take it back?

1:05:02.732 --> 1:05:07.362
Mr. Garcia, I'm sorry,
I don't think I can help.

1:05:26.631 --> 1:05:28.883
Let me see what I can do.

1:05:31.970 --> 1:05:34.222
Hey, Reggie.

1:05:34.305 --> 1:05:36.558
These people came in yesterday.

1:05:38.726 --> 1:05:42.105
And, uh, I wanna help 'em out.

1:05:42.188 --> 1:05:44.607
I mean, they...
They really can't afford this.

1:05:44.691 --> 1:05:47.444
We overdid it. I mean,
the car's gonna be in repo anyway

1:05:47.527 --> 1:05:50.155
if they go bankrupt, so...

1:05:50.238 --> 1:05:52.031
What do you say we cut 'em some slack?

1:05:52.115 --> 1:05:54.242
Let me see it.

1:06:10.175 --> 1:06:11.843
Is this your name here?

1:06:13.261 --> 1:06:15.805
- Yes, sir.
- You're an owner.

1:06:15.889 --> 1:06:18.016
Get the fuck out of here.

1:06:26.191 --> 1:06:29.027
I'm sorry, Mr. Garcia. I really tried.

1:06:29.110 --> 1:06:31.488
I am so... sorry.

1:07:01.267 --> 1:07:05.480
Another day of dealing with idiots
who want a $10,000 discount.

1:07:05.563 --> 1:07:08.107
If somebody else tells me
how they hate car salesmen,

1:07:08.191 --> 1:07:09.442
I swear I'm gonna snap.

1:07:09.526 --> 1:07:12.820
I met a guy yesterday. He would only
buy a car that was built on a Wednesday.

1:07:12.904 --> 1:07:15.198
That fucking retard.

1:07:15.281 --> 1:07:18.743
You know what?
I can't handle this shit anymore!

1:07:20.828 --> 1:07:23.957
Reggie's right.
We're a bunch of fuckin' whores.

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:26.459
A bunch of uneducated,

1:07:26.543 --> 1:07:29.128
arrogant, goddamn fucking whores.

1:07:29.212 --> 1:07:32.382
How can you blame these poor bastards?

1:07:32.465 --> 1:07:35.218
Every single person
that walks into this place

1:07:35.301 --> 1:07:37.887
has been raped by a car salesman.

1:07:37.971 --> 1:07:42.267
And they know, beyond a shadow of a doubt,
it's gonna happen again.

1:07:43.726 --> 1:07:46.312
Do you wanna know why I'm here?

1:07:46.396 --> 1:07:49.190
I'm here because I tried
to make something of my life,

1:07:49.274 --> 1:07:51.276
and I failed.

1:07:51.359 --> 1:07:53.861
But at least I gave it a shot.

1:07:53.945 --> 1:07:56.823
Javier, you weren't selling cars,

1:07:56.906 --> 1:07:59.075
you'd either be washing 'em
or stealing 'em.

1:07:59.158 --> 1:08:02.370
Shamim, you think you're better
than everybody else?

1:08:02.453 --> 1:08:04.330
Well, let me tell you something.

1:08:04.414 --> 1:08:07.542
The cars you're selling are worth more
than the hometown you grew up in.

1:08:07.625 --> 1:08:11.004
You see, these people,
they don't earn their money

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:13.172
by fucking other people out of it.

1:08:13.256 --> 1:08:17.677
And all they wanna do is put a little food
on the table for their children.

1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:20.722
Maybe send them to a decent school
or something.

1:08:20.805 --> 1:08:24.642
Then we come along
and take them for everything we can.

1:08:24.726 --> 1:08:26.102
And you know what's worse?

1:08:26.185 --> 1:08:28.605
We're so good at it,
that when we're done,

1:08:28.688 --> 1:08:31.316
most of 'em think
we're heroes for doing it.

1:08:34.902 --> 1:08:36.529
If you're gonna steal from these people,

1:08:36.613 --> 1:08:38.781
at least show 'em
just a little bit of respect.

1:08:38.865 --> 1:08:43.453
Let's not insult them
any more than we have to.

1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:53.046
I think the green pea
ain't no green pea no more.

1:08:54.547 --> 1:08:57.508
Are we taking advantage of people?

1:08:57.592 --> 1:08:59.177
Let us take a look.

1:09:00.470 --> 1:09:04.807
Your job is to sell the car
for as much as you can.

1:09:04.891 --> 1:09:08.603
The customer's job is to buy the car
for as little as possible.

1:09:08.686 --> 1:09:12.482
Why should you feel guilty
about being better at your job

1:09:12.565 --> 1:09:15.026
then somebody else is at theirs?

1:09:15.109 --> 1:09:17.862
You know, if I went with a customer
to get a deal on a car

1:09:17.945 --> 1:09:19.825
and I told them we were gonna
fuck the salesman,

1:09:19.864 --> 1:09:22.200
he would love it.

1:09:22.283 --> 1:09:25.161
If he makes a good deal,
he takes money out of your pocket.

1:09:25.244 --> 1:09:27.705
If you make a good deal,
you take money out of his.

1:09:27.789 --> 1:09:29.999
What's the difference?

1:09:30.083 --> 1:09:33.044
Now, if somebody buys a car and he leaves
thinking he got screwed,

1:09:33.127 --> 1:09:35.129
then he is an idiot.

1:09:35.213 --> 1:09:38.675
The buyer has all the control.

1:09:38.758 --> 1:09:41.427
He can get up and leave at any time.

1:09:41.511 --> 1:09:45.807
He does not own that car
until he drives it off the lot.

1:09:45.890 --> 1:09:47.684
Not when he signs the papers.

1:09:47.767 --> 1:09:53.356
He does not own that car
until he takes delivery.

1:09:53.439 --> 1:09:55.191
So who has the control, huh?

1:09:55.274 --> 1:09:57.402
If he got fucked, he fucked himself.

1:09:57.485 --> 1:09:59.779
It's that simple.

1:09:59.862 --> 1:10:03.074
Be proud of what you do.

1:10:03.157 --> 1:10:04.742
Be the best,

1:10:04.826 --> 1:10:08.538
and never, never apologize for it.

1:10:13.042 --> 1:10:16.212
- I'm thinkin' of quitting, mo.
- No.

1:10:16.295 --> 1:10:18.631
You can be a great salesman.

1:10:18.715 --> 1:10:20.425
Don't let Reggie ruin you.

1:10:20.508 --> 1:10:23.261
Make the deals you can live with.

1:10:23.344 --> 1:10:26.431
When I'm gone, Bobby joon,
you become top man.

1:10:26.514 --> 1:10:29.225
- Where are you going?
- Afghanistan.

1:10:29.308 --> 1:10:33.104
I have to get the assholes
that killed my sister.

1:10:33.187 --> 1:10:35.732
What are you talking about, mo?
You can't go back there.

1:10:35.815 --> 1:10:37.442
They'll never let you out.

1:10:37.525 --> 1:10:39.402
I don't care.

1:10:41.154 --> 1:10:44.407
You're a good man,
but don't stay here too long.

1:10:44.490 --> 1:10:46.760
- They'll take it away from you.
- Woman on P.A.: Reggie, line 12, please.

1:10:46.784 --> 1:10:48.953
Reggie, line 12.

1:10:51.914 --> 1:10:54.250
- Yeah.
- Are we on schedule?

1:10:54.333 --> 1:10:57.545
The carjust came in.

1:10:57.628 --> 1:11:01.758
No, the idiot's still in lockup.
No bail yet.

1:11:01.841 --> 1:11:03.801
I'll unload it myself tonight.

1:11:03.885 --> 1:11:05.720
You fucking better.

1:11:19.525 --> 1:11:22.028
- Randall: Fuck you.
- Eddie: What do you mean, fuck me?

1:11:22.111 --> 1:11:23.547
- Man, you sold the car.
- Man, leave me alone.

1:11:23.571 --> 1:11:25.364
- Did your uncle Joe make parole?
- Shut up.

1:11:25.448 --> 1:11:28.201
Hey, no, this is good, Randall.
Randall sold a car.

1:11:28.284 --> 1:11:30.536
Eddie on P.A.: Randall to the men's room.

1:11:30.620 --> 1:11:34.207
Randall to the men's room.
Customer waiting.

1:11:35.958 --> 1:11:38.461
Randall on P.A.: Shut up, Eddie.

1:11:38.544 --> 1:11:41.130
Eddie: Randall, your mom on line one...

1:11:43.174 --> 1:11:46.219
- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

1:11:49.639 --> 1:11:51.516
Good.

1:11:54.352 --> 1:11:56.854
Wanna buy me a car.

1:11:58.773 --> 1:12:00.691
Now, dickhead.

1:12:03.528 --> 1:12:05.738
Three cash deals. Not bad.

1:12:05.822 --> 1:12:08.825
Reggie: Looking at all this money
just makes you wanna cry.

1:12:10.827 --> 1:12:12.829
Donna?

1:12:12.912 --> 1:12:15.164
Donna, we gotta go.
We gotta go right now before...

1:12:15.248 --> 1:12:16.850
I'll explain later.
We don't have much time.

1:12:16.874 --> 1:12:19.274
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
Bobby, what are you talking about?

1:12:20.962 --> 1:12:23.798
Hey, Nixon.
We been waiting for you to get home.

1:12:23.881 --> 1:12:26.926
May we come in?

1:12:27.009 --> 1:12:30.513
Everett, why don't you tie up
Bobby's lovely wife?

1:12:30.596 --> 1:12:32.807
And you put these on.

1:12:46.904 --> 1:12:49.240
Hey, reg!

1:12:49.323 --> 1:12:52.493
What would you call the flintstones
if somebody shot their nuts off?

1:12:52.577 --> 1:12:54.513
Yeah, what would you call 'em?
What would you call 'em?

1:12:54.537 --> 1:12:56.247
Wouldn't be "nigger," would it?

1:13:00.334 --> 1:13:02.795
You're not so humorous tonight, Reggie.

1:13:02.879 --> 1:13:04.922
Come on, white boy! Tell me a joke.

1:13:07.258 --> 1:13:11.137
Hey, I wonder, is killing the general
manager grounds for dismissal?

1:13:16.350 --> 1:13:18.644
Wait. I can cut you in.

1:13:18.728 --> 1:13:20.855
Long-term. A shipment every week.

1:13:21.856 --> 1:13:24.066
I'm lovin' this shit, man.

1:13:25.651 --> 1:13:28.005
I can't believe you're still trying
to put me together, man.

1:13:28.029 --> 1:13:29.947
The balls on you.

1:13:30.031 --> 1:13:31.824
Damn, Reggie.

1:13:31.908 --> 1:13:34.118
I tell you what. I'll make you a deal.

1:13:34.201 --> 1:13:37.163
You tell me one of
your very funny nigger jokes,

1:13:37.246 --> 1:13:39.123
one that I haven't heard before,

1:13:39.206 --> 1:13:42.752
and I'll let your pale ass
live for three more minutes.

1:13:42.835 --> 1:13:44.715
You got three seconds
to startjokin', white boy.

1:13:53.471 --> 1:13:56.098
St. Peter is at his gate

1:13:56.182 --> 1:13:59.268
when three black guys walk up.

1:13:59.352 --> 1:14:00.937
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

1:14:01.020 --> 1:14:04.815
Three niggers walk up.

1:14:04.899 --> 1:14:07.739
St. Peter runs back to god and says,
"there's three niggers at the gate.

1:14:07.818 --> 1:14:09.695
What should I do?"

1:14:09.779 --> 1:14:12.782
God says, "there's no racism here.
Go back and welcome them."

1:14:12.865 --> 1:14:16.869
After a few minutes, St. Peter
runs back and says, "they're gone."

1:14:16.953 --> 1:14:20.748
God says, "who? The niggers?"

1:14:20.831 --> 1:14:23.960
St. Peter says, "no, the gates."

1:14:30.341 --> 1:14:32.343
That wasn't funny, Reggie.

1:14:32.426 --> 1:14:35.596
And you don't seem to understand
when something isn't funny, do ya?

1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:38.683
Hmm? Give me another one.
Come on, just give me another one.

1:14:38.766 --> 1:14:40.977
Come on, Reggie. Go!

1:14:41.060 --> 1:14:43.229
A woman tells a police sketch artist

1:14:43.312 --> 1:14:47.233
she was mugged by a...
Blue eyed, blond-haired,

1:14:47.316 --> 1:14:48.943
well-dressed man.

1:14:49.026 --> 1:14:51.070
The sketch artist
draws a picture of a black...

1:14:51.153 --> 1:14:53.155
- Uh-uh.
- A nigger.

1:14:53.239 --> 1:14:55.366
The woman says, "that's him."

1:14:57.952 --> 1:15:00.955
Hey, check this out. I got one.
I got one. Look. Hey, two niggas walk...

1:15:01.038 --> 1:15:03.332
Would you shut the fuck up?

1:15:03.416 --> 1:15:05.793
Man, fuck it. Man, shit.

1:15:10.715 --> 1:15:13.175
Kill his ass.

1:15:13.259 --> 1:15:15.011
Somebody's comin'.

1:15:23.019 --> 1:15:24.812
Shit.

1:15:30.026 --> 1:15:32.153
It's over there.

1:15:42.997 --> 1:15:46.709
Relax, Nixon.
We'll be out of here in no time.

1:15:48.294 --> 1:15:50.463
- Fuck.
- Try it again.

1:15:52.506 --> 1:15:54.592
What's wrong with those numbers?

1:15:54.675 --> 1:15:56.552
Motherfucker!

1:15:59.597 --> 1:16:02.683
- Talk fast.
- I didn't have enough time to get it.

1:16:02.767 --> 1:16:04.685
- He screwed us!
- No. No, no, no.

1:16:04.769 --> 1:16:06.645
Give me a chance
to find the combination.

1:16:06.729 --> 1:16:09.982
I'm sure it's in here. The old... the old
man, he don't remember anything.

1:16:10.066 --> 1:16:12.151
I can... I can find 'em. I can find it.

1:16:16.989 --> 1:16:19.075
You got 60 seconds.

1:16:20.284 --> 1:16:22.179
Let's just kill him
and get the fuck out of here!

1:16:22.203 --> 1:16:24.538
In less than a minute.

1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:58.155
- Time's up.
- This asshole doesn't read books.

1:16:58.239 --> 1:16:59.365
Wait. Wait.

1:17:03.619 --> 1:17:06.122
- This must be it.
- Then do it.

1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:19.969
That's a little distracting.

1:17:20.052 --> 1:17:22.429
Just do it.

1:17:32.940 --> 1:17:34.817
Yeah.

1:17:34.900 --> 1:17:38.904
- Right. That's it. Let's waste him.
- Sorry, Bobby. It's just business.

1:17:38.988 --> 1:17:42.533
Hey! Let's toss those guns
up on the desk first, boys.

1:17:42.616 --> 1:17:43.951
Who the fuck are you?

1:17:44.034 --> 1:17:46.120
You don't toss them guns,
you'll never find out.

1:17:46.203 --> 1:17:48.581
- Now!
- Let's go, motherfuckers! Move it!

1:17:50.916 --> 1:17:52.835
Fuck over there, bitch.

1:18:01.927 --> 1:18:04.138
I guess I win the bonus.

1:18:06.682 --> 1:18:08.601
Let's kill these motherfuckers.

1:18:08.684 --> 1:18:11.854
- Sorry, Bobby. Nothing personal.
- Why are you doing this, jj?

1:18:11.937 --> 1:18:14.690
Because, man,
we been here all night, I'm tired,

1:18:14.773 --> 1:18:17.693
and a nigga just wants to go home.

1:18:17.776 --> 1:18:19.737
Do it.

1:18:30.164 --> 1:18:33.584
- About fucking time!
- Had to go looking for you.

1:18:41.675 --> 1:18:46.388
- Who are the spectators?
- Soon to be dead witnesses. Sorry, Bobby.

1:18:46.472 --> 1:18:50.309
Listen, Reggie, man. Let's talk about this
shit, man. Come on. Come on, please.

1:18:50.392 --> 1:18:55.022
You are so beyond fucked
you couldn't catch a bus back to fucked.

1:18:57.233 --> 1:19:00.402
We gotta weigh this shit out.
Kill them so we can get out of here.

1:19:01.487 --> 1:19:03.906
- What the fuck is going on?
- Don't move.

1:19:03.989 --> 1:19:06.075
Christ, mo.
What the hell are you doing here?

1:19:06.158 --> 1:19:08.744
- Are we expecting anybody else?
- Mo: What is this, Reggie?

1:19:08.827 --> 1:19:10.746
Mo, stand over there.

1:19:12.122 --> 1:19:13.832
You think I'm scared of you?

1:19:59.461 --> 1:20:01.672
Are you all right, Bobby joon?

1:20:03.841 --> 1:20:05.634
I'm fine.

1:20:05.718 --> 1:20:07.886
Mo. Mo.

1:20:07.970 --> 1:20:09.972
Oh, f... fuck.

1:20:10.055 --> 1:20:12.683
Looks like you win the bonus, Bobby joon.

1:20:12.766 --> 1:20:14.935
Fuck the bonus, man. Fuck the bonus.

1:20:30.993 --> 1:20:34.079
What do you call three dead drug dealers

1:20:34.163 --> 1:20:36.332
and five dead lowlifes

1:20:36.415 --> 1:20:39.335
in a car dealership?

1:20:39.418 --> 1:20:42.629
A good start.

1:20:44.631 --> 1:20:47.092
You look pretty bad there, Reggie.

1:20:47.176 --> 1:20:49.303
Fuckin' jj.

1:20:49.386 --> 1:20:51.513
I was starting to like him, too.

1:20:55.476 --> 1:20:57.603
I'll tell you something, kid.

1:20:57.686 --> 1:20:59.730
Don't ever get shot.

1:20:59.813 --> 1:21:02.316
It hurts like hell.

1:22:11.510 --> 1:22:13.846
Oh, wow, Bobby.
Look at all the people.

1:22:13.929 --> 1:22:15.806
Just go to work like normal.

1:22:15.889 --> 1:22:17.933
Everything will be fine, okay?

1:22:19.768 --> 1:22:21.186
We work here, officer.

1:22:21.270 --> 1:22:23.647
- Okay, go ahead.
- Thank you.

1:22:23.730 --> 1:22:26.442
Hey, Eddie.

1:22:26.525 --> 1:22:28.235
Vvhathappened?

1:22:28.318 --> 1:22:30.446
Reggie fucked himself good last night.

1:22:30.529 --> 1:22:31.822
Jj too.

1:22:31.905 --> 1:22:33.657
Stupid assholes
were selling more than cars.

1:22:33.740 --> 1:22:36.702
I can't believe
they were working together.

1:22:36.785 --> 1:22:38.036
Sure had me fooled.

1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:40.164
Mohammed too.

1:22:40.247 --> 1:22:42.207
They're all dead.

1:22:43.959 --> 1:22:46.545
Place wasn't a car dealership.
It was a goddamn pharmacy.

1:22:48.213 --> 1:22:50.799
So you didn't notice anything
out of the ordinary?

1:22:50.883 --> 1:22:53.343
No, everything seemed
pretty normal when I left

1:22:53.427 --> 1:22:56.555
about, uh... I think it about 10:00.

1:22:58.390 --> 1:22:59.766
That's it?

1:22:59.850 --> 1:23:02.019
That's it.

1:23:04.688 --> 1:23:06.398
You like this car?

1:23:06.482 --> 1:23:08.525
Yeah. V8?

1:23:08.609 --> 1:23:11.278
Yeah, it's a v8.
You should take it for a drive.

1:23:11.361 --> 1:23:13.697
- Nah.
- Yeah, you should take it for a drive.

1:23:13.780 --> 1:23:15.824
Check out the front here.
Right up here in front,

1:23:15.908 --> 1:23:17.548
there's even a holder for your doughnuts.

1:23:17.576 --> 1:23:19.578
Get the fuck out of here.

1:23:25.167 --> 1:23:28.295
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:23:30.714 --> 1:23:33.008
Do you still love me?

1:23:34.301 --> 1:23:36.803
Unfortunately.

1:23:38.388 --> 1:23:41.350
Enough to pull the invoice for this car?

1:23:41.433 --> 1:23:44.770
You wanna show the invoice to a customer?

1:23:44.853 --> 1:23:47.272
Why not? He asked.

1:23:49.024 --> 1:23:51.026
What would Reggie say?

1:23:51.109 --> 1:23:52.486
Oh, nothing.

1:23:52.569 --> 1:23:55.049
I'm sure right about now
he's probably trying to fuck the devil

1:23:55.113 --> 1:23:57.366
out of an air conditioner.

1:24:04.414 --> 1:24:06.583
- Thanks a lot, Bobby.
- Have a good one, detective.

1:24:06.667 --> 1:24:09.294
- Take it easy.
- You too, partner.

1:24:13.632 --> 1:24:15.068
Woman on P.A.: Sales, line two, please.

1:24:15.092 --> 1:24:17.135
How much should I make
on that deal, Eddie?

1:24:17.219 --> 1:24:19.638
Not a whole lot. Double maybe.

1:24:19.721 --> 1:24:21.014
Good.

1:24:21.098 --> 1:24:23.392
You got a $10,000 bonus coming, though.

1:24:23.475 --> 1:24:25.769
This is one crazy fuckin' business, Eddie.

1:24:25.852 --> 1:24:28.212
Hey, partner, I know
it's your first month, but don't worry.

1:24:28.272 --> 1:24:31.066
They're not all as crazy as this.

1:24:31.149 --> 1:24:33.026
Woman on P.A.: Reggie, dial one, please.

1:24:33.110 --> 1:24:35.279
Uh, Reggie...

1:24:35.362 --> 1:24:37.781
Cancel that.

1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:03.802
