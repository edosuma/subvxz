WEBVTT

00:01.459 --> 00:01.835
Mistress:
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:01.835 --> 00:03.836
What does your kinj do?

00:03.878 --> 00:05.714
It takes us all to paradise.

00:05.755 --> 00:08.925
Maybe it connect all
of the stingfly brains together,
like a hive.

00:08.967 --> 00:12.387
We've come to bring peace
to your village.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.597
If four of the infected
come into a town,

00:14.639 --> 00:16.140
and then they
then pass on their kinj

00:16.181 --> 00:17.434
every time one
becomes affected--

00:17.475 --> 00:20.895
65,536.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.856
That's more people than even
live in the Capital.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.942
First person
to get one of these
from Yavalla was Gwynn.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.527
How long does she have
before she's like this?

00:27.569 --> 00:29.571
The first 20 or 30 days,
she'll be wasting away.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.995
( music playing )

00:39.706 --> 00:43.793
It's the false queen
with a Blackblood witch
by her side.

00:46.463 --> 00:50.383
Surely she knows better
than to attack the Capital.

00:50.425 --> 00:54.554
She has an army with her.
I don't like it.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.765
Keep the gates closed.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.069
Order the attack.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.659
Give the order.
Kill them all, Commander.

01:25.001 --> 01:30.131
Are you deaf?
Commander, give the order
or face execution.

01:35.595 --> 01:39.265
- What is this?
- There's nothing to fear.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.559
Yavalla comes to you
in peace.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.561
How dare you?

01:50.860 --> 01:56.699
Strip her of her adornments,
then lock her in the prison.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.536
- ( cheering )
- That was easy.

01:59.577 --> 02:02.914
I always prefer
a bloodless takeover.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.834
The Commander is one
of our first unitings.

02:09.336 --> 02:12.048
( theme music playing )

02:31.151 --> 02:32.360
Still nothing?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.529
Uh, less than nothing.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.780
Yavalla is out there
spreading this disease

02:35.822 --> 02:37.073
and Gwynn's life
is getting sucked away.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.077
- This is horrible.
- You have no idea.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.913
You're not the one
with all of this rat blood
on your hands.

02:43.955 --> 02:47.000
You know,
whenever I do manage to
get any kind of sleep,

02:47.041 --> 02:49.544
I have all these nightmares
about all of these rats
that I've killed

02:49.586 --> 02:52.297
- just come to get me
for revenge.
- All right, all right.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.966
We've confirmed that the kinj
seems to live at the base
of the brain.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.178
Until it's ready to split,
and then-- then it moves
to the frontal area.

02:58.219 --> 03:00.847
But we can't cut it out
of either place without killing
the poor infected things.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.808
Which means that surgery
is not an option.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.980
Well, you said Gwynn
loses more of her life
with each uniting.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.107
- Mm.
- She doesn't have
much time left.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.235
- All right,
you can't give up.
- Never.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.905
We're just moving from,
um, surgery to toxins.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.699
We're searching for poison
that doesn't kill rats,
but kills kinjes.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.159
And therefore presumably
doesn't kill people.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.077
And how long
is that going to take?

03:23.119 --> 03:26.748
( chuckles )
I don't know, Talon.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.584
A day, a moon? Eternity?
Who knows, Talon?

03:29.626 --> 03:30.835
We're working blind.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.633
Well, it seems to me
our only option now is--

03:36.674 --> 03:39.594
Our only option now is what?

03:39.636 --> 03:42.388
Nothing.
Get back to work.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.397
She's a bossy little thing,
isn't she?

04:07.247 --> 04:12.043
You know, uh, there's
no blades allowed in here.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.211
You gonna tell Munt on me?

04:17.548 --> 04:19.216
You really hate me, don't you?

04:19.259 --> 04:21.844
I don't hate you, Garret.

04:21.886 --> 04:25.640
I mean, it's obvious
why I should hate you.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.142
Someone responsible
for beating,

04:28.184 --> 04:33.982
starving,
and, well, enslaving me.

04:34.023 --> 04:39.153
But you,
why do you hate me so much?

04:47.328 --> 04:49.956
I don't hate you.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.377
Could it be...

04:54.419 --> 04:57.463
because I ended up
with Talon?

04:58.548 --> 05:01.050
( chuckles )

05:01.092 --> 05:05.638
And tell me,
what difference would
it make if I did hate you?

05:05.680 --> 05:09.767
Because all too often, Zed,
you and I are going to have
to fight side by side.

05:09.809 --> 05:15.606
And when we do,
I want to make sure
that you will have my back.

05:20.528 --> 05:25.283
This might come
as a surprise to you,

05:25.325 --> 05:28.578
but I really care about Talon.

05:28.619 --> 05:33.124
And right now,
for some reason I completely
fail to understand,

05:33.166 --> 05:35.126
you're the thing
that makes her happy.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.507
For that reason alone,
I've got your back.

05:44.677 --> 05:48.348
Good. Well,
I'm glad that we could be
mature about this.

05:48.389 --> 05:48.806
Good.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.104
Now punch yourself
in the face.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.064
Oh!

06:00.026 --> 06:01.402
Oh, you're dead!

06:01.444 --> 06:02.987
What's going on here?

06:04.572 --> 06:05.865
Nothing.

06:07.992 --> 06:10.703
Nothing.
Any-- any breakthroughs
with Janzo or Wren?

06:12.705 --> 06:15.666
- No, nothing yet.
- Then we're all in agreement.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.377
We have to find
and kill Yavalla.

06:17.418 --> 06:20.546
Well, that won't be easy.
I stabbed her through the heart.

06:20.588 --> 06:21.964
A moment later it was like
it never happened.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.591
Then we'll cut off her head.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.760
And keep hacking until there's
nothing left to regenerate.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.804
Janzo:
Might I suggest fire?

06:29.013 --> 06:30.181
You know what
we're talking about?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.809
Of course.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.561
What solution could
three warriors be plotting

06:35.603 --> 06:37.939
other than to hack and slash
their enemy to bits?

06:37.980 --> 06:40.400
Janzo,
if we let Yavalla live,

06:40.441 --> 06:41.901
we're sacrificing
everyone else.

06:41.943 --> 06:45.988
I know. Doesn't mean
I have to be happy about it.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.907
Yavalla is still
Wren's mother, after all.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.784
- You can't say anything
about thi--
- I can.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.869
But I won't.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.917
Unfortunately, I agree that
your plan is all we have left.

06:57.959 --> 07:01.337
She'll probably never want
to speak to me ever again.

07:01.379 --> 07:04.340
I know this is hard for you.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.009
But will it work?

07:07.051 --> 07:09.137
If we kill Yavalla,
will it free the infected?

07:09.178 --> 07:11.556
Probably.
Maybe. Who knows?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.724
Janzo, we need
your expert opinion.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.897
Please. Will it work?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.150
The infected are all
controlled by Yavalla.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.485
If she and her kinj die,

07:24.527 --> 07:27.405
there'll be nothing left
to control.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.699
They'll no longer be slaves.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.869
So if Yavalla dies,
it will cure the infected?

07:32.910 --> 07:35.746
There's no guarantee.
It's just--

07:35.788 --> 07:37.331
it's just my expert opinion.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.753
This fulminate,

07:42.795 --> 07:45.506
it will burn through tissue
faster than any other substance.

07:45.548 --> 07:47.592
Just-- just ignite
and throw it.

07:47.633 --> 07:51.304
So, you think fire
is our best chance
at destroying Yavalla?

07:51.345 --> 07:55.057
It should destroy all of her
living tissue instantly.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.894
There'll be nothing left
to regenerate.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.771
But then again...

08:00.813 --> 08:02.356
who knows?

08:10.865 --> 08:12.408
Well, thank you, Janzo.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.083
You don't even know where
Gwynn and Yavalla went.
They could be anywhere by now.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.295
The Outpost has
taken in refugees from every
corner of the Realm.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.339
Gwynn and Tobin have been seen
heading north to the Capital.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.633
Finding her isn't the problem.
Getting close to her is.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.677
She'll be surrounded
by infected soldiers
and believers,

08:31.719 --> 08:34.804
- all of whom would die for--
- Where are you all going?

08:34.847 --> 08:39.101
Oh, they're just--
don't worry, they're, um,

08:39.143 --> 08:41.979
they're just going
to find Gwynn.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.106
Janzo, you're in charge of
the Outpost until I get back.

08:44.148 --> 08:47.485
- You can't be serious.
- Wren, I need you to be
Janzo's right hand.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.820
Make sure he doesn't
screw everything up.

08:49.862 --> 08:52.698
Here. The Lu-Qiri are of
no use to us where we're going,

08:52.740 --> 08:55.326
so use the rings
to summon them if you need to.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.579
What are you planning, Zed?
Don't lie to me.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.498
Janzo:
Why don't you come inside
with me? Come on.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.291
- I'll make you
a delicious hot ale.
- I'm not stupid.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.627
I know you're going to try
to kill my mother.

09:04.669 --> 09:09.131
Well, you're wasting your time.
She can't be killed.

09:09.173 --> 09:12.218
I'm sorry, Wren,
but we have to try.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.845
I hate my mother,
but I don't want her to die.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.519
She's all I've got.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.729
That's not true.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.481
You've got me.

09:28.317 --> 09:29.777
Thank you.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.382
Rejoice the end of oppression
and cruelty of the Three.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.218
The Three have now been
replaced by the One,

09:54.260 --> 09:57.388
and her name is Yavalla.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.933
I am your Queen,
but she is our God.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.396
( crowd murmuring )

10:08.774 --> 10:12.903
Join with me. Become United.

10:12.945 --> 10:17.366
Enjoy the peace
and the well-being
that it brings.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.499
This isn't right!
What happened to the Three?

10:34.342 --> 10:36.636
( ghostly whispering )

10:54.362 --> 10:56.489
( crowd murmuring )

10:56.530 --> 10:58.616
Don't be afraid.

10:58.658 --> 11:02.203
In time,
you will all be United.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.054
There you are.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.931
I've been looking
all over for you.

11:21.972 --> 11:26.852
- What are you doing?
- Being in charge.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.563
I think. Not really sure.
I mean, isn't--

11:29.605 --> 11:32.650
isn't this where I'm supposed
to be in charge from?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.610
I suppose.
Not necessarily.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.487
Do you know what, Wren?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.489
No one's ever given me
responsibility before.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.493
Oh. You-- you mean other
that curing the Plaguelings?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.328
Or saving Garret's life?

11:44.370 --> 11:47.081
Or running the only
tavern in town?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.500
Yes, I guess there
is always that.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.586
But now, there's--
there's soldiers to command
and people to feed.

11:52.628 --> 11:56.632
Not to forget the daily risk
of infestation.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.050
It's all just
a bit overwhelming.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.512
Oh, stop hiding up here
and get back to work.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.180
Talon chose you for a reason,
Janzo.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.683
You're the best man
for the job.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.269
Thank you.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.020
And don't worry.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.565
When you fail,
I'll be right here
to take over.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.527
All right?

12:16.569 --> 12:18.696
Come on!
You can do this.

12:20.906 --> 12:24.326
( music playing )

12:24.368 --> 12:28.372
- ( swords clashing )
- ( men screaming )

12:37.548 --> 12:39.049
Cover your ears.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.350
You slaughtered
unarmed peasants.

12:48.392 --> 12:49.894
Unarmed, but infected.
Just as deadly.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.937
It doesn't do any good
to kill them.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.315
- There's always more.
- Well, that's where
I think you're wrong.

12:54.356 --> 12:56.692
We're gonna kill
every last one of them

12:56.734 --> 12:59.111
till the infection's purged
from the Realm.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.571
You would have to
kill thousands.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.325
Tens of thousands, I hope.

13:04.366 --> 13:07.536
'Cause there's nothing like
killing freaks. Right, boys?

13:07.578 --> 13:11.665
- Yeah!
- ( laughter )

13:11.707 --> 13:13.542
And how do you know
who's infected?

13:13.584 --> 13:16.921
I've already
encountered so many,
I have a feel for it.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.590
Lucky for you three
or you would be dead already.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.175
So you're just
randomly wandering around
slaughtering people?

13:21.217 --> 13:25.012
Not random.
We're beating a path
to Gallwood Outpost.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.931
It's said to be
the only safe haven.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.892
You should turn around
while you still can.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.770
You're going to the Outpost?

13:32.812 --> 13:36.232
In case you don't know,
they're not exactly friendly
to the Prime Order.

13:36.273 --> 13:39.401
There is no Prime Order anymore.

13:39.443 --> 13:42.530
The Realm's in chaos.
Infections everywhere.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.324
There's only freaks
and not freaks.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.952
Them and us.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.831
He does have a point.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.211
Don't let the freaks
get their hands on that

13:57.253 --> 13:59.088
pretty little face of yours.

14:10.516 --> 14:14.436
Do you think Janzo
will let them in?

14:14.478 --> 14:15.396
I hope not.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.745
There are fewer people
coming in every day.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.080
Does that mean everyone
out there is infected?

14:33.122 --> 14:34.665
I hope not,
but we've already taken in

14:34.707 --> 14:36.458
too much for this Outpost
to accommodate.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.002
Wren:
No, there's still room.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.587
We can just put them
in the abandoned district.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.841
It's not a question
of room, Wren.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.134
There's nothing to feed them.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.428
The storehouse is as empty
as Munt's head.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.472
Hey, my head is not empty.
Is it?

14:50.514 --> 14:53.475
So we start portioning food.
We just enforce half rations.

14:53.517 --> 14:56.478
Mm. We do need a fair
system of apportions.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.814
Man: Next.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.150
( rat squeaking )

15:03.402 --> 15:06.405
I say the bigger the man,
the more food he should get.

15:06.447 --> 15:10.868
Munt, you raise
an excellent point.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.704
- I do?
- Yes.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.081
You can live off the food
that you've got stored
in that big old gut of yours.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.417
- From now on, you only have
a quarter ration.
- No, no. No.

15:18.459 --> 15:22.129
- I'll take...
- Janzo, no.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.549
- Thank you.
- Man: Next.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.473
( rat squeaking )

15:32.514 --> 15:35.225
Keep pawing at her,
little one.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.356
That's right.

15:46.946 --> 15:47.863
Next.

15:51.575 --> 15:52.493
Hello.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.871
Uh.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.249
Do you want some cheese?

16:01.543 --> 16:05.172
Thank you, sir.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.592
Next.

16:28.612 --> 16:31.782
Sun's up.
We should get moving.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.785
I'll fill the waterskins,
but then we have to go.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.462
I'm genuinely interested
in what you see in him.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.383
You really want to know?

16:53.053 --> 16:56.724
How about he's honest?
Loyal.

16:56.765 --> 16:59.727
He'd die for me
without a second thought.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.980
All sounds a bit boring
and predictable to me.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.751
Don't come any closer.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.836
I don't want to hurt you.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.506
You stay right there.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.884
( growling )

17:33.469 --> 17:35.220
I get that the man's
good-looking,

17:35.262 --> 17:37.097
but he's about
as exciting as a mouthful
of sawdust and water.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.559
And you're more like
a mouthful of acid.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.728
That hurts.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.400
Garret lives by a code,

17:48.442 --> 17:50.694
and he finds a way to do
what needs to be done

17:50.736 --> 17:53.155
without betraying
his friends.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.114
Unlike someone I know.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.162
Where is he, by the way?

18:00.204 --> 18:01.330
He should be back by now.

18:01.371 --> 18:02.831
( grunting )

18:10.047 --> 18:11.423
( wheezing )

18:21.308 --> 18:23.894
I'm sorry.
Was that your father?

18:26.730 --> 18:28.524
Where is your father?

18:32.277 --> 18:33.695
You should go to him.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.490
Go on!
Go to your father!

18:47.376 --> 18:48.710
I may not always
be in the right,

18:48.752 --> 18:50.087
but at least I try and fix
what I've broken.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.550
( grunting, panting )

18:54.591 --> 18:56.176
What happened?

18:56.218 --> 18:58.637
( gasps )
Almost got infected.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.974
You shouldn't go off alone.
You're not immune like us.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.976
Wait, did you even get
the water?

19:04.017 --> 19:08.147
- Garret: What?
- See?

19:08.188 --> 19:11.316
- He's not so perfect.
- I'm sorry, what was that?

19:11.358 --> 19:14.778
Nothing. Come on.
We better keep moving.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.745
( ghostly whispering )

19:39.720 --> 19:42.931
Your...

19:42.973 --> 19:46.560
friends...

19:46.602 --> 19:48.520
are on their way.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.612
It must be something
important, right?

19:56.653 --> 19:58.780
Because they wouldn't just
call us unnecessarily.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.908
They know we're doing
so much work around here.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.993
I just don't understand
what wasn't clear

20:03.035 --> 20:05.287
about my instructions.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.375
I mean,
if they're not infected,
let them in.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.710
And if-- if they are, then...

20:13.420 --> 20:17.174
- Oh.
- Who are they?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.092
- Only our sworn enemy.
- Ugh.

20:19.134 --> 20:23.305
We've come all this way
for sanctuary from the plague,

20:23.347 --> 20:25.766
only to find the Outpost gates
closed to us.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.685
I'm sorry, but, um,
but you can't come in.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.021
Not unless you, um,
renounce your allegiance

20:31.063 --> 20:33.190
to the Prime Order
and the Three

20:33.232 --> 20:35.734
and unless you support
Queen Rosmund

20:35.776 --> 20:38.654
as the rightful ruler
of the Realm.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.989
There.
That should get rid of them.

20:41.031 --> 20:45.202
I don't know much about
this Queen you speak of,

20:45.244 --> 20:48.789
but I will gladly renounce
the Prime Order and the Three.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.419
We present ourselves as men
with no allegiance,

20:54.461 --> 20:58.423
wanting only to serve
and protect those uninfected
left in the Realm.

20:58.465 --> 21:02.135
- Damn.
I wasn't expecting that.
- It's only nine men.

21:02.177 --> 21:03.804
It's nothing
our Lu-Qiri can't handle
if they make trouble.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.389
I'd still rather
send them away.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.766
I just don't see how
we can deny them sanctuary.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.435
What say you, gatekeeper?

21:10.477 --> 21:13.605
You've won the war.
Prime Order is defeated.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.234
Don't let this red armor
stand in the way

21:17.276 --> 21:19.820
of joining forces against
a common enemy.

21:23.073 --> 21:23.991
Open the gate.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.577
( gate opening )

21:30.706 --> 21:33.333
Wren,
I hope I don't regret this.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.759
Very clever.

21:42.801 --> 21:46.013
Boys, welcome to
your new home.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.472
Maybe Yavalla
didn't stop here.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.600
( indistinct shouting )

22:31.641 --> 22:34.186
Yavalla can't have taken
control of the Capital already.

22:34.227 --> 22:37.856
- It's not possible.
- Zed: It is if they were
unsuspecting.

22:37.898 --> 22:41.526
How would the Outpost
have faired if we didn't know
firsthand about Yavalla?

22:41.568 --> 22:43.653
Or if Wren hadn't have invented
that kinj detector rat cage?

22:43.695 --> 22:48.158
- Janzo invented that.
- Would you two shut up
and focus?

22:48.200 --> 22:51.411
How are we going to get in alive
through that gate?

22:51.453 --> 22:53.914
We don't go in
through the gate. Come on.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.378
( knocking )

22:59.419 --> 23:01.546
- I'll get it.
- Ah-ha.

23:01.588 --> 23:07.469
Tell them we're closed.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.389
- We're closed.
- Oh, you are, are you?

23:13.183 --> 23:19.022
My men and I have been
on the road for a long time
with no female company.

23:22.359 --> 23:25.821
How about you give me
a little kiss?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.076
You put your hands
on her again,

23:31.118 --> 23:33.995
I'll throw you out
covered in bruises.

23:36.373 --> 23:37.749
I'm shaking in my boots.

24:01.982 --> 24:06.236
Listen, I already regret
opening my gates to you

24:06.278 --> 24:08.363
and your herd of swine.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.032
So one more outburst
and I will change my mind,

24:11.074 --> 24:12.367
and I'll have you banished.

24:14.870 --> 24:17.747
The gatekeeper.
What are you doing here?

24:17.789 --> 24:19.875
Go back to the gate
and stop the freaks
from getting in.

24:19.916 --> 24:23.211
Janzo just happens to be
acting base commander,

24:23.253 --> 24:25.046
so you better watch
your mouth.

24:25.088 --> 24:27.382
This little wisp of a man?

24:27.424 --> 24:30.302
Base commander?

24:33.346 --> 24:37.017
- Nah, it can't be that easy.
- What can't be that easy? Hmm?

24:39.102 --> 24:41.605
- No offense intended.
- Hmm.

24:41.646 --> 24:44.649
I only ask that
you stay open long enough

24:44.691 --> 24:46.610
for us to get some bread
and ale in our guts,

24:46.651 --> 24:48.445
and then we'll get out
of your hair.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.657
My men and I are hungry.

24:52.699 --> 24:55.076
Listen, this whole
Outpost is hungry.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.287
So you'll get the same
food rations as everyone else.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.664
You will get half
a ration of barley meal
and a cube of cheese

24:59.706 --> 25:01.917
thrice a fortnight.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.376
The storehouse needs
careful management now--

25:03.418 --> 25:05.670
now that we've got all
these refugees taking--

25:05.712 --> 25:10.467
Oh? And how many days' rations
have you got left
in that storehouse?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.844
- That's privileged information.
- Yes.

25:12.886 --> 25:16.681
Good idea to keep
that number quiet.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.642
We wouldn't want a riot,

25:18.683 --> 25:20.519
have the warehouse emptied
by an angry mob.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.188
- That's not going to happen.
- All the same.

25:23.230 --> 25:27.442
My men and I will take it
upon ourselves to guard
that little storehouse,

25:27.484 --> 25:29.277
make sure it keeps us fed.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.904
You leave my storehouse alone!

25:30.946 --> 25:33.281
I don't need
any of your help.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.616
Let's go, boys.

25:52.592 --> 25:55.136
I served under a Prime Order
quartermaster.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.138
I used to get wine
into the city this way.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.684
Zed: Did the wine end up
smelling like whatever's
stuck to my boot?

26:03.353 --> 26:04.813
Hey!

26:10.860 --> 26:13.446
- Garret: I get the feeling
they aren't infected.
- Talon: No.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.198
They don't have that
happy calm thing happening.

26:17.033 --> 26:19.911
It's all right.
It's all right. It's all right.

26:19.953 --> 26:23.665
We're here to help,
but we need to find
Queen Rosmund

26:23.707 --> 26:26.751
and the Blackblood
prophetess Yavalla.

26:26.793 --> 26:30.964
- Do you know where they are?
- The Queen sits in
the Council Room.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.757
They say Yavalla's
in the new shrine.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.176
Courtyard Square.

26:35.218 --> 26:39.139
And The Three?
What about them?

26:39.180 --> 26:42.058
One never returned from--
from the war with the Queen.

26:42.100 --> 26:46.563
- And Two and Three?
- Some say One and Three
are dead.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.107
I saw them drag Two
to the prison.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.152
All right, come on.

26:54.821 --> 26:57.991
Listen, this tunnel
leads to a drainage culvert
we came in through.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.201
It'll take you outside
the city gates.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.786
From there you'll have to
make a run for it.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.330
Just follow the smell.

27:03.371 --> 27:05.790
If you can make it
to Gallwood Outpost,

27:05.832 --> 27:08.209
they'll provide you shelter.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.587
Avoid everyone else.
Am I clear?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.964
- Yes.
- Go on.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.765
Come on. I know a back way
to the Courtyard Square.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.892
We have to get to Yavalla.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.234
Step aside. We're running
the storehouse now.

27:33.276 --> 27:35.612
You're running nothing!

27:35.654 --> 27:37.822
Time for you and your men
to leave the Outpost.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.868
We gave you more
than fair warning.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.708
It's me that gave you
fair warning.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.293
( blows ring )

27:50.335 --> 27:53.046
( distant roaring )

27:53.088 --> 27:55.256
( crowd murmuring )

27:55.298 --> 27:58.218
- ( blows ring )
- ( roaring )

28:02.639 --> 28:04.140
( roaring )

28:10.563 --> 28:11.690
I'd heard rumors.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.360
Truly they defy description.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.946
- ( growling )
- ( screaming )

28:17.987 --> 28:19.781
( screaming )

28:19.823 --> 28:22.534
There's no need to fight!
You can't win!

28:22.575 --> 28:25.495
( crowd murmuring )

28:36.047 --> 28:37.632
( screeching )

28:40.635 --> 28:42.262
( screeching )

28:44.347 --> 28:47.267
( Lu-Qiri roars )

28:49.811 --> 28:51.146
( all screaming )

28:57.026 --> 29:00.697
( screaming continues )

29:06.995 --> 29:08.037
One.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.081
No.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.627
But I have what
was in his head.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.921
But how?

29:16.963 --> 29:19.257
I caught his foolish
young acolyte

29:19.299 --> 29:21.342
trying to take it back
to the Capital.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.969
He hadn't figured out
how to use it,

29:23.011 --> 29:26.848
so I took it for myself.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.476
No, no, no!
Don't hurt them!

29:29.517 --> 29:31.895
Please! Please!
They could serve you.

29:34.773 --> 29:39.152
( screaming continues )

29:39.194 --> 29:40.570
Janzo: Go on, then.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.655
Take all our food
if that's what you want!

29:42.697 --> 29:45.742
Take it all!
Just leave us here to starve!

29:45.784 --> 29:50.538
Oh, I might have been
content with your food.

29:50.580 --> 29:54.042
But try this insulting
move on me?

29:54.083 --> 29:57.003
Now I'll have to rule
this whole Outpost

29:57.045 --> 29:59.881
for the good of everyone.

29:59.923 --> 30:03.551
- This is my Outpost now!
- ( screaming continues )

30:11.684 --> 30:13.144
Kneel.

30:16.981 --> 30:18.066
Or die.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.749
( gasps )

30:36.626 --> 30:39.254
Seems we'll have to finish
what the Prime Order started.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.802
Arrest all the Blackbloods.

30:49.222 --> 30:53.184
( music playing )

31:06.823 --> 31:09.951
- What are you doing?
- Pass me your rings.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.799
What are you up to,
little man?

31:24.841 --> 31:26.801
I thought
I was going to prison.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.678
You haven't got pointed ears.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.432
I need you to manage
these pitiful people
as they starve.

31:32.473 --> 31:35.059
With half rations,
they might be unhappy,

31:35.101 --> 31:37.020
but they're not going
to starve.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.022
We'll start
with quarter rations
for the useful ones,

31:39.063 --> 31:41.232
and no rations for the sick,

31:41.274 --> 31:43.318
the young,
the old, or the weak.

31:43.359 --> 31:45.278
You're crazy.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.488
It's time to thin the herd.

31:47.530 --> 31:51.492
No sense wasting food
on the soon to be dead.

31:51.534 --> 31:54.621
Never. I'm not going
to help you do any of that.

31:54.662 --> 31:58.499
You will...

31:58.541 --> 32:00.877
when you see
what I do to these people
of you disobey me.

32:05.131 --> 32:07.050
( crowd gasping, screaming )

32:09.427 --> 32:11.304
( crowd screaming )

32:11.346 --> 32:14.057
Stop! Stop! Enough! Enough!

32:17.101 --> 32:20.813
Listen!

32:20.855 --> 32:23.483
I'm now overlord
of this Outpost.

32:24.692 --> 32:27.987
All food belongs to me.

32:28.029 --> 32:33.743
If you're strong,
you serve me well,

32:33.785 --> 32:37.205
you will be given
enough food to survive.

32:37.246 --> 32:41.167
If not, you'll starve.

32:43.586 --> 32:49.425
Anyone who opposes me will die
in agony like these fools.

33:18.788 --> 33:20.957
There's only two guards.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.625
But the worshippers
could cause trouble as well.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.502
Zed and I are immune.

33:24.544 --> 33:25.962
If they get their hands
on you, Garret--

33:26.004 --> 33:27.588
Then you burn Yavalla
to a pile of ashes

33:27.630 --> 33:29.674
and do not hold back
to protect me.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.676
Getting to Yavalla
is all that matters.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.594
If this thing doesn't work,
we need to cut off
Yavalla's head

33:33.636 --> 33:35.179
and keep hacking
until that kinj is dead.

33:35.221 --> 33:36.764
If you don't get to her first,
I will.

33:39.434 --> 33:42.895
- You ready?
- Both: Ready.

33:44.397 --> 33:48.192
( grunting, shouting )

33:59.120 --> 34:00.621
It's over, Yavalla.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.374
( panting )

34:04.834 --> 34:07.045
Stop!

34:07.086 --> 34:08.379
It's not her.

34:10.505 --> 34:13.676
- Where is she?
- I'm right here, Zed.

34:13.717 --> 34:17.221
- I see you.
- Where is your body?

34:17.263 --> 34:22.143
I have many bodies,
many eyes, many hands.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.437
And those bodies
are slowly dying.

34:24.478 --> 34:25.855
Do your minions know that?

34:25.897 --> 34:28.565
As bodies die,
others take their place.

34:28.608 --> 34:32.320
We have to go.
We have to go now!

34:34.822 --> 34:40.286
There's nowhere to go,
Captain Spears.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.245
Zed?

34:43.246 --> 34:44.165
Zed?

34:46.083 --> 34:49.629
( music playing )

35:00.306 --> 35:02.308
( blows ring )

35:06.521 --> 35:09.899
( indistinct muttering )

35:09.941 --> 35:12.110
- Aah!
- ( growling )

35:12.151 --> 35:14.153
That was bloody fast,
wasn't it?

35:21.119 --> 35:24.205
( Lu-Qiri snarling )

35:25.289 --> 35:26.874
Hello.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.084
My name is Janzo.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.378
I--I'm ex-- ex-lover of Talon.

35:30.419 --> 35:35.716
- Current lover of Wren.
- ( roars )

35:35.758 --> 35:38.928
I translated some Blackblood.
It's probably not perfect.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.097
I mean, it'll be close
to perfect. I'm Janzo.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.766
But, um, I'm not sure I'll be
able to pronounce it all,

35:43.808 --> 35:45.393
but hopefully
it makes enough sense.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.562
( growling )

35:49.147 --> 35:50.690
( whimpering )
All right.

35:50.731 --> 35:52.608
Here it goes.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.871
- No?
- ( snarls )

36:04.912 --> 36:07.748
Think, Janzo, think.

36:07.790 --> 36:10.543
What would Janzo do-- no.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.086
What would Talon do?

36:25.516 --> 36:26.934
( roaring )

36:31.564 --> 36:35.359
( snarling )

36:35.401 --> 36:38.321
( whimpering )

36:46.829 --> 36:49.165
- Zed!
- We need to get out
of the city.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.708
Hopefully Yavalla
hasn't gone too far.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.961
No, we're not leaving yet.
Not without Gwynn and Tobin.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.963
Gwynn and Tobin are infected.

36:56.005 --> 36:58.174
The only thing
we can do for them now
is track down Yavalla

36:58.216 --> 37:00.092
and put an end
to this whole thing.
Garret, tell her.

37:05.431 --> 37:08.976
We're not leaving
until we find Gwynn.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.357
Outnumbered by crazy people.

37:19.737 --> 37:20.988
Ooh.

37:23.991 --> 37:26.035
( door opening )

37:26.077 --> 37:27.870
Munt! Munt!

37:27.912 --> 37:30.164
Did it work, Janzo?
Did the demons listen to you?

37:30.206 --> 37:32.667
I don't know.
I don't-- I don't think so.
We'll have to see.

37:32.708 --> 37:34.627
- Oh, when?
- When what?

37:34.669 --> 37:37.046
- When will we see?
- Oh, gods.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.507
- I didn't tell them a time.
- Well, where did you
tell them to bring it?

37:39.548 --> 37:40.508
I didn't tell them
that either.

37:40.549 --> 37:41.842
Yeah, I know the feeling.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.636
All right,
the logical assumption

37:43.678 --> 37:45.846
would be for them to bring it
where we met them, right?

37:45.888 --> 37:47.848
- Come on, let's go back.
- All right, let's go.

37:47.890 --> 37:51.644
- Let's go!
- Ooh.

37:51.686 --> 37:53.562
- Are you hungry?
- ( screams )

37:53.604 --> 37:56.440
- I'm always hungry.
- It was here.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.775
And then they were jumping
from behind as well.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.695
Munt.
Munt, they understood me.

38:00.736 --> 38:02.780
I always told you they were
amazing creatures, didn't I?

38:02.822 --> 38:05.157
I mean, I just
barely told them to go hunting
and here they are.

38:05.199 --> 38:08.244
I mean, it's not enough
to feed the masses, but--

38:08.286 --> 38:10.663
( snarling )

38:10.705 --> 38:12.623
Munt:
I guess you speak Blackblood
better than you think.

38:12.665 --> 38:15.501
Yes. Yes, I guess I do.

38:15.543 --> 38:19.130
From now on, call me
Janzo, Lord Of The Demons.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.841
Get the cows.
I'll get the sheep. Go!

38:27.555 --> 38:30.099
- Just three guards.
- And they're all connected
to Yavalla.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.184
They see us,
the whole city sees us.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.811
It's the only route
to the Council Chamber.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.188
A place where no one
in their right mind
would ever go.

38:36.230 --> 38:38.232
( footsteps approaching )

38:43.612 --> 38:44.905
Three's better than six!

38:48.534 --> 38:51.454
( grunting )

39:44.006 --> 39:44.924
Garret.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.983
Man: You three stay here.
We'll search the lower passage.

40:03.025 --> 40:04.944
- They couldn't have gone far.
- Talon: Right.

40:04.985 --> 40:09.156
You catch those traitors
and we'll just stand here
and guard.

40:09.198 --> 40:11.325
Zed:
"Just stand here and guard"?

40:11.367 --> 40:13.035
Talon: I've never been
in the military before.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.203
Garret:
Come on, it's this way.

40:16.247 --> 40:19.166
One ration of meat
for each of you.

40:19.208 --> 40:22.920
- There you go.
- Well, don't crowd together.
You'll draw attention.

40:22.962 --> 40:25.256
- There you go.
- It's not much.

40:27.383 --> 40:30.219
Quick, quick.
Now listen, do not cook it.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.888
Dry it and eat it
over more days, yes?

40:38.561 --> 40:41.814
Find out where
they're getting the food from.

40:41.856 --> 40:45.401
May I ask where the food
is coming from?

40:45.443 --> 40:49.029
- Oh, Janzo has a whole--
- Friends from the gates
who acquired it for us.

40:49.071 --> 40:50.531
Um, why'd you ask?

40:50.573 --> 40:55.327
No reason. Just curious.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.957
Don't tell anyone where
or how we got it.

40:59.999 --> 41:04.837
The Prime Order soldiers
will stop our supply
otherwise. Come on.

41:04.879 --> 41:07.506
- Oh, oh.
Oh, right, right, right.
- Come on.

41:07.548 --> 41:11.677
There are still hundreds
waiting to be converted
hiding within the city,

41:11.719 --> 41:15.306
but we will find them all
within a matter of days.

41:15.347 --> 41:17.933
That's all I have to report,
Queen Rosmund.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.352
Thank you, sister.

41:23.314 --> 41:26.609
Yavalla commands us to send
another wave of ambassadors

41:26.650 --> 41:28.527
to touch every corner
of the Realm,

41:28.569 --> 41:33.240
including our Greyskin brothers
and sisters in the South.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.326
Yavalla has spoken.

41:45.711 --> 41:47.421
Talon:
She's dying, Garret.
