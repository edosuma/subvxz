31:59.459 --> 32:00.459
Right.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.421
We're going to regroup
tomorrow in the morning.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.923
We're no good at night here.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.174
Ray, anything?

32:07.259 --> 32:08.342
Negative.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.219
I'm gonna make a final
pass by the ridge.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.345
All right, keep in touch.

32:11.429 --> 32:12.949
Otherwise, I'll see you
in the morning.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.770
All units, report back.

33:43.605 --> 33:44.647
Excuse me, sir.

33:44.731 --> 33:46.315
If you've seen my husband
or my son...

33:46.399 --> 33:47.733
- Okay.
- Thank you.

33:47.817 --> 33:48.859
Pardon me.

33:48.943 --> 33:50.110
If I could give you this.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.737
This is my husband and my son.

33:51.821 --> 33:52.821
Just keep an eye.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.698
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

33:54.854 --> 33:56.772
Gunnison residents have been jolted

33:56.856 --> 33:59.650
by the mysterious disappearance
of a man and his young son

33:59.734 --> 34:01.777
during a hunting trip yesterday.

34:01.861 --> 34:03.862
Buddy Benson,
a repair supervisor

34:03.947 --> 34:05.215
for the Gunnison
telephone company

34:05.239 --> 34:08.158
and his young son, Sam,
never returned home last night.

34:08.242 --> 34:10.202
Molly? Honey, come eat.

34:11.579 --> 34:13.080
How's the job hunt going?

34:13.164 --> 34:16.875
Is breaking and entering
a special skill?

34:16.960 --> 34:19.085
You got any suggestions?

34:19.170 --> 34:21.713
I hear the bank's hiring.

34:33.059 --> 34:35.768
Morning, Sheriff.

34:35.853 --> 34:37.646
Hey.

34:37.730 --> 34:39.731
Morning.

34:43.987 --> 34:46.571
Any word on Buddy and his kid?

34:46.656 --> 34:48.239
Carrie?

34:48.319 --> 34:50.571
Coffee, please.

34:52.282 --> 34:54.408
You guys have been out
all night, huh?

34:54.492 --> 34:56.577
No. We called it off at 2:00 a.m.

34:59.289 --> 35:00.747
Ray didn't come home?

35:00.832 --> 35:02.749
Eddie, I thought
he was out with you.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.626
I tried his cell phone.

35:04.711 --> 35:06.378
Carrie, listen to me.

35:06.463 --> 35:08.046
Ray was pushing
real hard last night.

35:08.131 --> 35:09.423
I'm sure he's still looking.

35:09.507 --> 35:10.799
Cell reception out there...

35:10.884 --> 35:14.344
He always calls, Eddie.

35:20.518 --> 35:22.561
Ray!

35:27.066 --> 35:28.525
Ray?!

35:31.362 --> 35:32.988
Ray, you down there?

35:37.285 --> 35:38.869
Ray?

35:58.890 --> 36:00.557
Oh, my God.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.697
I can't believe this is Ray Adams.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.747
I don't want to believe it either.

36:26.251 --> 36:29.169
Know what it would take
for a man to do this?

36:29.254 --> 36:32.673
For someone to...
skin a human being?

36:32.757 --> 36:35.300
There were no tracks.

36:35.385 --> 36:37.886
Nothing.

36:37.971 --> 36:43.684
Eddie, you're in over your head.

36:43.768 --> 36:45.394
What are you going to do?

36:45.478 --> 36:48.855
I'll let you know
when I figure it out.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.358
Hey.

38:40.443 --> 38:41.443
Hey, Jesse.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.695
Hi.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.910
You know, you look at me
that same way in class.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.330
Yeah, well, uh...

38:53.414 --> 38:54.998
the clock's behind you.

38:55.082 --> 38:56.249
What?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.793
Tomorrow when you're
in class, turn around.

38:58.878 --> 38:59.878
You'll see it.

38:59.962 --> 39:01.129
Yeah, I...

39:01.213 --> 39:04.090
I know that it's there, but...

39:04.175 --> 39:07.927
We both know that's not
what you're looking at.

39:09.847 --> 39:13.767
You know, you never
were a good liar.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.188
Do you want to go swimming tonight?

39:18.272 --> 39:19.731
Swimming.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.316
Where?

39:21.400 --> 39:23.026
At school.

39:23.110 --> 39:26.696
Come on, it'll be like old times.

39:26.781 --> 39:30.116
Old times, like before
you had a boyfriend?

39:30.201 --> 39:33.036
Yeah.

39:33.120 --> 39:36.373
And it's ex-boyfriend, actually.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.625
He's been fired.

39:40.628 --> 39:41.378
So, tonight.

39:41.462 --> 39:44.005
Around 10:00.

39:48.302 --> 39:50.553
See you tonight.

39:59.355 --> 40:02.983
You told his wife?

42:42.018 --> 42:44.686
We're closing out now, Darcy.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.688
See you when you get here.

42:55.281 --> 42:57.282
You all right?

42:59.535 --> 43:01.786
If you want to talk...

43:02.955 --> 43:04.623
It's okay.

43:06.917 --> 43:09.836
You're welcome to stay
with me and Cathy tonight.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.922
Darcy's coming by-
I'm gonna stay with her.

43:15.259 --> 43:17.260
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:30.316 --> 43:32.984
Richie?

43:34.820 --> 43:36.279
Richie?

43:38.199 --> 43:39.699
No!

44:46.559 --> 44:49.978
We found Ray's body in the woods.

44:50.062 --> 44:55.108
He was, uh...
he was skinned alive.

44:58.571 --> 45:01.156
Think it's got something
to do with...

45:01.240 --> 45:03.908
Buddy and his kid disappearing?

45:03.993 --> 45:10.397
I think this kind of thing
doesn't happen here.

45:12.984 --> 45:14.442
Sheriff, we have a report

45:14.527 --> 45:16.570
of a small gas explosion
in the sewer under 16th.

45:16.654 --> 45:19.030
- Do you copy?
- Roger, Dispatch.

45:19.115 --> 45:22.117
Notify the fire department—
I'll meet 'em there.

45:22.201 --> 45:23.428
Right away, Sheriff.
Dispatch out.

45:23.452 --> 45:24.578
You want some help?

45:24.662 --> 45:26.955
I don't know, Dallas.

45:27.039 --> 45:28.498
Come on.

45:28.583 --> 45:30.709
I'll ride in the back.

46:42.925 --> 46:44.383
Nate?

46:46.887 --> 46:48.304
Nate?!

46:53.477 --> 46:55.937
Nate, where are you?

47:03.529 --> 47:04.737
What?

47:13.205 --> 47:14.664
Ricky.

47:14.748 --> 47:17.458
Hey.

47:18.502 --> 47:21.587
So, uh...

47:21.672 --> 47:24.298
how do we get in?

47:24.383 --> 47:26.342
I taped the lock after class.

47:32.516 --> 47:34.767
- Hmm.
- Uh-huh.

47:47.889 --> 47:50.682
I couldn't decide on which
suit I wanted to wear, so...

47:57.064 --> 48:00.734
Now... you tell me...

48:02.236 --> 48:07.032
are you looking at me
or the clock?

48:11.245 --> 48:13.455
Come here.

48:31.307 --> 48:32.766
Oh, my God.

48:36.646 --> 48:38.521
What do you think
you're doing, Jess?

48:38.606 --> 48:40.357
Dale, get out of here.

48:40.441 --> 48:42.484
Just remember, Ricky,

48:42.568 --> 48:44.861
I taught this little slut
everything she knows.

48:46.364 --> 48:49.032
No, Ricky, stop it!

48:49.116 --> 48:51.952
Stop it! Dale, stop it!

48:52.036 --> 48:53.411
Stop it! He's drowning!

50:14.785 --> 50:16.202
Get off me.

50:22.585 --> 50:23.752
What the hell was th at?

50:25.796 --> 50:26.963
Oh, my God.

50:27.048 --> 50:28.465
Oh, my God, get out of the water.

50:28.549 --> 50:29.632
- Get out!
- Jesse, go!

50:29.717 --> 50:31.551
Go!

50:31.635 --> 50:33.136
Oh, my God, get out of the pool!

50:33.220 --> 50:34.846
Jess, run!

50:36.557 --> 50:39.809
Oh, my God!

50:42.271 --> 50:43.646
Go! Go!

50:45.191 --> 50:46.232
Do you think he's dead?

50:46.317 --> 50:48.735
Why don't you go back and find out?

50:49.945 --> 50:51.446
No.

50:51.530 --> 50:52.906
Here!

50:53.949 --> 50:56.201
Window!

51:01.916 --> 51:03.833
Shit! Oh, shit!

51:05.711 --> 51:06.920
Aah, help me!

51:07.004 --> 51:08.838
Come on!

51:08.923 --> 51:10.215
Help me, aah!

51:12.134 --> 51:15.303
Ricky, come on!

51:15.387 --> 51:17.889
Go!

51:19.892 --> 51:23.353
Sherif, fwe have a 10-80
at the nucle ar power plant.

51:24.980 --> 51:27.107
Roger that.
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

51:27.191 --> 51:29.526
1 0-4, Sheriff. County and state
have been advised as well.

51:29.610 --> 51:31.444
Wanna tell me what the hell's
goin' on?

51:31.529 --> 51:34.114
There's been an explosion
at the plant.

51:36.158 --> 51:38.076
Well, this day keeps getting better.

51:56.011 --> 51:59.472
Daddy, Daddy!

51:59.556 --> 52:01.057
- Daddy!
- Hey.

52:01.141 --> 52:02.558
What is it?

52:02.643 --> 52:05.269
It was outside the window.

52:05.354 --> 52:07.063
What?

52:07.147 --> 52:08.815
It was a monster.

52:11.318 --> 52:13.403
Oh, come here.

52:13.487 --> 52:15.238
Come here.

52:16.198 --> 52:18.574
You know, when I was your age,

52:18.659 --> 52:21.077
I used to have these
awful nightmares.

52:21.161 --> 52:22.578
I saw it.

52:22.663 --> 52:24.038
It was real.

52:25.999 --> 52:28.292
See? No monster.

52:32.339 --> 52:33.339
Tim!

52:33.424 --> 52:35.842
Daddy!

52:37.219 --> 52:38.219
Dad!

52:39.513 --> 52:40.513
We have to go.

52:40.597 --> 52:42.432
Come on!

52:42.516 --> 52:45.184
Daddy!

53:41.575 --> 53:43.159
The fire spread
through the whole plant.

53:43.243 --> 53:45.369
They have to shut down
the reactors manually.

53:45.454 --> 53:47.997
Roger that.

53:48.081 --> 53:51.876
Dispatch, we have
to evacuate the entire town.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.629
Call the National Guard in
Colorado Springs for assistance.

53:54.713 --> 53:55.630
Over.

53:55.714 --> 53:56.714
10-4.

53:56.757 --> 53:59.217
Jesus Christ.

53:59.301 --> 54:00.301
- Sheriff.
- Yeah.

54:00.344 --> 54:01.738
I think you should hear about this.

54:01.762 --> 54:02.762
Dallas!

54:02.805 --> 54:03.721
All right, thanks a lot.

54:03.806 --> 54:05.241
Ricky, what the hell you doing here?

54:05.265 --> 54:07.243
Something came after us...
I don't know what happened.

54:07.267 --> 54:08.661
- What do you mean something...
- We ran all the way here.

54:08.685 --> 54:09.746
Slow down.
What came after you?

54:09.770 --> 54:10.997
- I don't know!
- Where were you?

54:11.021 --> 54:13.356
We were at the school.
Mark-h-he's dead,

54:13.440 --> 54:14.899
and I think they got Nick, too.

54:14.983 --> 54:16.275
What was it?

54:17.277 --> 54:19.654
Ricky!

54:19.738 --> 54:21.948
I don't know.

55:41.671 --> 55:44.798
♪ ♪

55:52.182 --> 55:54.058
Call in help.

55:54.142 --> 55:56.518
Somebody's got to know about this.

55:57.562 --> 55:59.563
Eddie.

56:02.984 --> 56:04.652
Dispatch, where's that backup?

56:04.736 --> 56:05.736
Dispatch, come in.

56:09.324 --> 56:11.825
Dispatch, come in.

56:14.037 --> 56:17.331
Let's go, let's get
the hell out of here.

56:22.236 --> 56:27.949
Carrie?

56:28.033 --> 56:29.784
The power's out.

56:31.036 --> 56:32.579
Carrie?

56:40.504 --> 56:42.338
Carrie?

56:43.340 --> 56:44.382
Carrie, are you over...

56:47.928 --> 56:49.262
Oh!

56:49.346 --> 56:50.555
Oh, my God.

56:55.561 --> 56:57.103
Help me!

57:00.399 --> 57:01.858
We have to keep running, baby.

57:15.956 --> 57:17.915
Let's get outta here!

57:21.962 --> 57:24.047
No, no! No!

57:51.950 --> 57:53.951
Mommy! We left him!

57:57.998 --> 57:59.707
Quiet. Shh.

57:59.792 --> 58:01.709
Come on, come on.

58:04.546 --> 58:07.840
Mommy, I'm scared.

58:07.925 --> 58:10.635
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.

58:10.719 --> 58:13.304
Did you see one?

58:15.683 --> 58:16.683
Me, too.

58:37.579 --> 58:41.124
Mommy, why did you leave Daddy?

58:42.710 --> 58:43.710
Shut her up!

58:46.380 --> 58:49.090
Hey. Put the cigarette out
and get down.

58:49.174 --> 58:51.300
Fuck you. I'm not gonna die hiding.

58:52.052 --> 58:53.386
Fuck you.

58:53.470 --> 58:55.346
Fuck you.

58:57.641 --> 59:00.059
- You're gonn a get us all killed.
- I wanna go home!

59:00.144 --> 59:02.186
- Shut her up. Shut her up.
- I wanna see Daddy!

59:02.271 --> 59:05.022
Shut her the fuck up,
or I swear to God...

59:40.060 --> 59:43.020
I don't think the police
station is such a hot idea.

59:43.105 --> 59:44.355
What do you want me to do?

59:44.439 --> 59:45.919
We don't know
what we're dealing with.

59:46.942 --> 59:47.942
Come on.

59:47.985 --> 59:50.403
Look out!

59:51.905 --> 59:52.822
Sheriff.

59:52.906 --> 59:53.948
Sheriff.

59:54.032 --> 59:55.199
- Darcy?
- Eddie.

59:55.284 --> 59:56.678
Darcy, what happened?
What are you doing?

59:56.702 --> 59:58.369
- At the diner. Carrie's stomach.
- What?

59:58.453 --> 01:00:00.580
- Shh. What?
- There was so much blood.

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:02.206
Her stomach—it was gone.

01:00:02.291 --> 01:00:06.544
She's dead! She's dead...

01:00:06.628 --> 01:00:09.422
Ricky, get her inside.

01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:11.507
Get her in.

01:00:14.052 --> 01:00:17.013
Eddie, people are dying.

01:00:17.097 --> 01:00:18.347
We need guns.

01:00:18.432 --> 01:00:20.725
The National Guard'll be here soon.

01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:22.393
Not soon enough.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.323
Can't believe I'm
letting you do this.

01:00:35.407 --> 01:00:36.574
This plan is stupid.

01:00:36.658 --> 01:00:37.908
Let's just leave town now.

01:00:37.993 --> 01:00:39.952
'Cause we're not going
to make it out of town

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:41.203
without weapons, dickhead.

01:00:41.288 --> 01:00:42.307
You're too stupid to talk, Dale.

01:00:42.331 --> 01:00:43.331
Shut up.

01:00:59.014 --> 01:01:00.765
Where are the guns?

01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:03.309
Follow me.

01:01:12.694 --> 01:01:14.820
Here they are.

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.948
Dale, grab some bags.

01:01:18.033 --> 01:01:20.493
Jesse, load them up.

01:01:24.373 --> 01:01:26.540
Eddie, you got power on that thing?

01:01:28.043 --> 01:01:30.127
Yeah, I just need some light.

01:01:44.893 --> 01:01:46.894
Go! Go! Go!

01:01:46.978 --> 01:01:49.146
Ground One, secure the area.

01:01:49.231 --> 01:01:52.566
Set up perimeter,
provide cover for Ground Two.

01:01:52.651 --> 01:01:55.027
Roger, Zero-6 out.

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:56.320
Move! Move! Move!

01:01:56.405 --> 01:01:57.863
Report status.

01:01:57.948 --> 01:01:59.323
Ground One
has secured perimeter.

01:01:59.408 --> 01:02:01.659
Ground Two
has secured perimeter.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:08.999
This is Sheriff Morales
for the National Guard. Come in.

01:02:09.084 --> 01:02:10.895
Repeat, Sheriff Morales
for the National Guard.

01:02:10.919 --> 01:02:12.420
Come in.

01:02:12.504 --> 01:02:14.422
This is Lieutenant
Woods, 89th Troop Command,

01:02:14.506 --> 01:02:16.090
Colorado National Guard.

01:02:16.174 --> 01:02:17.425
Go ahead, Sheriff.

01:02:17.509 --> 01:02:20.428
What's your location,
Lieutenant? Over.

01:02:20.512 --> 01:02:22.346
We're on Main Street.

01:02:22.431 --> 01:02:23.723
Listen, Lieutenant, I don't know

01:02:23.807 --> 01:02:25.057
what your men are walking into,

01:02:25.142 --> 01:02:27.685
but our situation is getting worse.

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:37.027
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?

01:02:37.112 --> 01:02:38.904
We have a missing man.

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:40.322
Hold on, Sheriff.

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.692
- Fire!
- We've got contact!

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:04.404
- Hold your fire!
- It's a fucking ambush!

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.408
Fender, 9:00!

01:03:08.492 --> 01:03:10.285
What the hell's going on out there?!

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:20.462
We've got contact!

01:03:22.548 --> 01:03:25.133
Fall back!
I repeat, fall back!

01:03:25.217 --> 01:03:26.259
Lieutenant!

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:38.271
Lieutenant, are you there?

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.690
Lieutenant, come in.
Are you there?

01:03:49.742 --> 01:03:51.660
We're not going to make it, are we?

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.629
Don't shoot!
Take what you want!

01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:05.674
I'm not getting killed
for no $6.25 an hour.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:10.679
We've been attacked.

01:04:10.763 --> 01:04:12.806
Terrorists hit Gunnison?

01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:15.308
Told you they would one day.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:18.311
What are you guys, stoned?

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.315
Grab some rifles.

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:27.946
You see that?

01:04:33.327 --> 01:04:34.869
Hurry up, Molly.

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:36.204
Hurry, Molly.

01:04:36.288 --> 01:04:37.872
Hello?!

01:04:41.651 --> 01:04:43.610
Hello?

01:04:45.405 --> 01:04:47.989
Are you hurt?

01:04:50.368 --> 01:04:51.410
Come on in.

01:04:52.412 --> 01:04:54.538
She'll be safe here.

01:04:57.875 --> 01:05:00.252
Dr. Lossen to O.R. 2, stat.

01:05:00.336 --> 01:05:03.380
Dr. Lossen to O.R. 2, stat.

01:05:04.424 --> 01:05:06.091
Keep pressure on that.

01:05:06.175 --> 01:05:08.468
Another liter.

01:05:08.553 --> 01:05:10.303
Hold up.

01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:13.682
Apparently got a carotid.

01:05:13.766 --> 01:05:15.600
Take him straight to Trauma.

01:05:15.685 --> 01:05:17.352
Easy now.

01:05:17.437 --> 01:05:19.479
Here you go.

01:05:21.858 --> 01:05:24.735
Code yellow, code yellow.

01:05:24.819 --> 01:05:27.612
All non-shift medical personnel
report to Critical Care.

01:05:56.642 --> 01:05:58.018
Hi.

01:05:58.102 --> 01:06:00.520
When are the lights going back on?

01:06:00.605 --> 01:06:03.940
We're on emergency generators
until the power's restored.

01:06:06.444 --> 01:06:08.111
Oh, God.

01:06:08.196 --> 01:06:10.363
Oh, I think my water just broke.

01:06:10.448 --> 01:06:12.532
Okay.

01:06:12.617 --> 01:06:14.159
I'll find a doctor.

01:06:51.423 --> 01:06:52.674
No!

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.973
Hey.

01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:02.976
You two look pretty shaken up.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.520
Hasn't been an easy night for her.

01:07:08.399 --> 01:07:11.192
And what about you?

01:07:12.236 --> 01:07:14.154
I'll live.

01:07:16.073 --> 01:07:18.742
Okay.

01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:21.745
We're leaving in five minutes.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:24.414
Thank you.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.603
Where is he?

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:02.077
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.125
Come on!

01:08:19.053 --> 01:08:20.428
Mommy!

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:26.725
Turn back! It's a trap!

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:28.728
It's a trap! It's a trap!

01:08:28.813 --> 01:08:30.395
What the fuck?

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:32.064
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go!

01:08:32.149 --> 01:08:34.109
Molly, come on, run!
Run, Molly!

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:39.823
Everyone, go, go!
Out the front!

01:08:40.866 --> 01:08:42.325
Fuck this!

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:53.002
Shoot the fucking thing!

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:04.305
- Dallas...
- What was that thing?

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:31.332
What!?

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:37.671
That's not possible.

01:09:38.756 --> 01:09:40.300
Shit.

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:41.551
Something's wrong.

01:09:41.635 --> 01:09:43.720
Check the other rooms!

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.520
What is?

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:24.302
- Come on, yeah...
- Go...

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.471
Go, baby, go! Keep running.

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:31.726
Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:34.520
What the hell?

01:10:34.605 --> 01:10:36.064
This is our help?!

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:41.152
What the fuck is going on, Eddie?!

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:42.570
Where the hell are the bodies?

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:43.905
Oh, they're gonna kill us all!

01:10:43.989 --> 01:10:45.657
We're not dead yet.

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:48.409
There may be weapons
and equipment we can still use.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:10:59.337
Radio.

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:07.387
National Guard, come in.

01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:11.391
Repeat—any
National Guard unit, come in.

01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:14.936
This is Colonel Stevens, U.S. Army.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.312
Identify yourself.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:18.064
Sheriff Eddie Morales.

01:11:18.148 --> 01:11:19.315
Gunnison, Colorado.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.025
You have to help us, Colonel.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.610
There's some kind of infestation

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:25.530
and if we don't get help soon,
there won't be any of us left.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:28.700
What's the army's evacuation plan?

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.868
Colonel?

01:11:34.206 --> 01:11:37.375
Colonel, we need immediate evac.

01:11:37.459 --> 01:11:38.626
Sheriff, all ground routes

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.086
have been compromised.

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.422
There is an airlift
in 30 minutes

01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:44.215
from Gilliam Circle.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.218
Confirm: airlift, Gilliam Circle.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:48.469
We'll be there in 20 minutes.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:50.513
But that's right
in the center oftown.

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:53.099
We'll be there, Colonel.

01:12:01.775 --> 01:12:04.068
What the fuck are you?

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.493
Everyone, get in the Striker!

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:14.996
I'll drive.

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.457
Get up, go, go, go, go.

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:20.293
You sure you can drive that thing?

01:12:21.545 --> 01:12:23.004
All right, I'll get on the gun.

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:24.464
Don't miss.

01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:26.632
Don't crash.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:36.017
Hold on!

01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:14.407
Why are we stopping?

01:14:14.491 --> 01:14:16.576
It doesn't make any sense.

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.620
Gilliam Circle is right
in the center of town.

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:22.206
We'll be surrounded by those things.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:25.710
- Wait a second—what are you saying?
- I think the colonel was lying.

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:27.670
That's crazy.

01:14:27.754 --> 01:14:29.338
The government
doesn't lie to people.

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:33.593
The army thinks about
containment first.

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:35.720
They can't risk this
getting any worse.

01:14:35.804 --> 01:14:38.973
Help is a few miles down that
road and they're waiting for us.

01:14:39.057 --> 01:14:40.766
Now, if you won't
drive us there, I will.

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:42.036
Eddie, if she's right,
the only thing

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.371
down that road are
more of those things.

01:14:43.395 --> 01:14:44.664
You're not seriously
considering this.

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:46.481
I'm considering whatever
keeps us alive.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.608
Which means
getting out of this town.

01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:51.319
There are only two
helicopters in town,

01:14:51.403 --> 01:14:52.695
but one's at the airport.

01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:54.048
No, it's too far.
We'll never make it.

01:14:54.072 --> 01:14:55.615
The other one's at the hospital.

01:14:55.699 --> 01:14:58.618
The people at the hospital
probably used it to get out.

01:14:58.702 --> 01:15:00.119
That's a chance we have to take.

01:15:00.204 --> 01:15:02.497
If you're wrong
and the helicopter's gone,

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.248
we're all dead.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.501
If I'm right, they're dead,
if they follow you.

01:15:12.799 --> 01:15:14.091
There's a truck coming.

01:15:19.556 --> 01:15:21.224
There will be

01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:23.518
an emergency evacuation
from Gilliam Circle.

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:25.394
Medical care and airlift...

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:27.688
Sheriff, what the hell
are you doing in there?

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:28.689
Never mind that.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.399
You guys heading to the airlift?

01:15:30.484 --> 01:15:31.526
Yeah.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:33.569
Okay, follow us.
We don't have much time.

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:35.071
All right, listen up.

01:15:35.155 --> 01:15:38.699
Everybody's got to choose right now.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.620
I'm going to the hospital
with the tank.

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:44.705
We all need
to go to the center of town.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:46.309
- That's right.
- I'm going with my brother.

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.043
- I'm with you.
- I'm going in the tank.

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:52.380
Dallas, don't do this.

01:15:52.464 --> 01:15:53.631
She's wrong.

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.550
And brother or not, he's wrong.

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.218
You're gonna get them killed!

01:15:57.302 --> 01:15:59.155
We're running out of time,
Sheriff—we gotta move now.

01:15:59.179 --> 01:16:00.346
Hold on!

01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:01.639
We're coming with you!

01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:08.187
Wait.

01:16:13.193 --> 01:16:15.194
Take care.

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:19.031
I hope we're both wrong.

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:25.079
Medical care and airlift...

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:29.208
Let's go!

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:31.127
There will be
an emergency evacuation

01:16:31.211 --> 01:16:33.296
from Gilliam Circle.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:36.882
Medical care and airlift will be
provided for all residents.

01:16:50.188 --> 01:16:51.480
I didn't help anybody.

01:16:52.649 --> 01:16:54.734
I was too scared.

01:16:54.818 --> 01:16:57.361
I just watched them die.

01:17:08.206 --> 01:17:09.915
All right, put these on.

01:17:11.918 --> 01:17:12.918
You, too.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.864
All right, listen,

01:17:41.948 --> 01:17:43.366
whatever happens inside,

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:45.701
the only person that can't
get hurt is Kelly, all right?

01:17:45.786 --> 01:17:46.786
We all protect Kelly.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.705
What is this, the Titanic?

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:51.517
Screw the women and children
first shit, man.

01:17:51.541 --> 01:17:53.227
Look, asshole, unless
you can fly the helicopter,

01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:55.836
shut the fuck up.
Let's go.

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:35.543
Oh, Jesus.

01:18:49.849 --> 01:18:52.476
Maybe they've all gone.

01:20:33.519 --> 01:20:35.145
Oh, God, no!

01:20:36.605 --> 01:20:37.814
Fucking shoot it!

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:45.822
Jesse, no, wait!

01:20:45.906 --> 01:20:46.948
Move, now!

01:21:52.932 --> 01:21:53.973
Jesse!

01:21:54.934 --> 01:21:57.143
No, wait!

01:22:10.991 --> 01:22:12.867
Ricky!

01:22:26.298 --> 01:22:27.215
Ricky, wait!

01:22:27.299 --> 01:22:28.842
Motherfucker!

01:22:28.926 --> 01:22:30.009
Ricky!

01:22:56.328 --> 01:22:57.579
Come on.

01:22:59.832 --> 01:23:01.749
Come on, get up.

01:23:01.834 --> 01:23:03.001
You're gonna make it.

01:23:08.799 --> 01:23:10.717
We have to go—now!

01:23:10.801 --> 01:23:11.843
Come on...

01:23:11.927 --> 01:23:14.721
Come on!

01:23:14.805 --> 01:23:16.431
Go! Go, go, go, go!

01:23:28.861 --> 01:23:30.194
Joe!

01:23:30.279 --> 01:23:31.779
Is this everybody?

01:23:31.864 --> 01:23:33.197
This is all that's left.

01:23:33.282 --> 01:23:34.407
What have you heard?

01:23:34.491 --> 01:23:36.534
The airlift will be here soon.

01:23:39.997 --> 01:23:41.539
Clear!

01:23:41.624 --> 01:23:43.416
Come on!

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:46.711
Go, go! You all right?

01:23:49.798 --> 01:23:51.633
Come here, Molly.

01:23:52.676 --> 01:23:55.553
Go! Go! Follow your mom!

01:23:55.638 --> 01:23:57.430
Come on!

01:23:57.514 --> 01:23:58.765
Everyone, move!

01:24:00.726 --> 01:24:02.060
Run, Molly!

01:24:12.529 --> 01:24:14.322
Come on!

01:24:15.032 --> 01:24:17.408
Dallas!

01:24:17.493 --> 01:24:18.493
I'm trying!

01:24:20.496 --> 01:24:22.246
Are you gonna shoot that thing?

01:24:22.331 --> 01:24:24.290
Hang on!

01:24:29.338 --> 01:24:30.380
Let's go!

01:24:37.638 --> 01:24:39.430
You got her?

01:24:50.651 --> 01:24:53.945
Get down!

01:24:54.029 --> 01:24:56.739
Colonel Stevens,
this is Gunnison County

01:24:56.824 --> 01:24:59.325
requesting status on evac!
Over!

01:25:05.457 --> 01:25:07.792
Colonel, where's the airlift?

01:25:07.876 --> 01:25:11.045
Sheriff, we are ten miles out.

01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:13.464
Hold your position. Over.

01:25:13.549 --> 01:25:16.884
Colonel, we're here. Over.

01:25:19.013 --> 01:25:21.514
God help us all.

01:25:22.683 --> 01:25:24.017
All right, get out of here—now.

01:25:24.101 --> 01:25:25.393
I'm gonna buy us some time.

01:25:25.477 --> 01:25:26.728
I'm not leaving you.

01:25:26.812 --> 01:25:28.062
Get to the chopper!

01:25:28.147 --> 01:25:29.814
You don't have to do this, Dallas.

01:25:29.898 --> 01:25:32.400
Now! Go! Go!

01:25:32.484 --> 01:25:34.485
Come on, you motherfuckers!

01:25:41.827 --> 01:25:42.994
Okay, go!

01:25:46.832 --> 01:25:47.999
Kelly! Get down!

01:25:51.211 --> 01:25:52.670
Go! Go! Go!

01:25:55.257 --> 01:25:57.341
Hey, over here!

01:26:09.938 --> 01:26:11.064
Come on.

01:26:17.446 --> 01:26:18.696
Okay, go!

01:26:22.493 --> 01:26:24.202
Fuck!

01:26:25.370 --> 01:26:27.205
Hey, come on over here!

01:26:50.646 --> 01:26:51.729
Come on!

01:27:05.327 --> 01:27:06.535
Fuck you!

01:28:03.176 --> 01:28:04.635
We're not leaving without him!

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.554
We have to go.

01:28:06.638 --> 01:28:08.180
He'll make it!

01:28:12.185 --> 01:28:15.021
Die!

01:28:36.334 --> 01:28:37.710
Let's go!

01:30:15.976 --> 01:30:17.852
Mommy?

01:31:15.076 --> 01:31:17.077
Close your eyes!

01:31:21.917 --> 01:31:24.543
Hang on!
Mommy!

01:31:32.761 --> 01:31:34.678
Dallas?

01:31:34.763 --> 01:31:36.222
Dallas?

01:31:46.608 --> 01:31:49.360
Oh, Jesus.

01:31:49.444 --> 01:31:52.029
Hey, you all right?
Ricky?

01:31:52.113 --> 01:31:55.241
Yeah. Press harder, honey.

01:32:13.927 --> 01:32:16.053
Drop your weapons!

01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.400
You bastards killed the entire town.

01:32:29.484 --> 01:32:30.943
We're just following orders.

01:32:31.027 --> 01:32:32.861
Now, put down your weapons.

01:32:53.883 --> 01:32:56.302
We need a medic for my brother.

01:32:56.386 --> 01:32:59.054
Medevac is inbound.

01:32:59.139 --> 01:33:02.933
Secure any weapons,
and let's set up a perimeter!

01:33:03.018 --> 01:33:04.143
Let's go! Move it!

01:33:27.334 --> 01:33:29.835
Thought I told you not to crash.

01:33:34.007 --> 01:33:36.508
Mommy?

01:33:36.593 --> 01:33:39.011
Are the monsters gone?

01:33:40.055 --> 01:33:42.056
They're gone.
