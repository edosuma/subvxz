WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.711
Previously on 90210...
IVY:
I felt rejected.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.714
I went home, and
Oscar was there,

00:05.756 --> 00:07.257
and I slept with him.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.551
Ivy doesn't know that you
and I slept together.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.094
You destroyed my family.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.180
I thought it only fitting
that I destroy yours.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.390
Remember those photos
you didn't want to take?

00:15.432 --> 00:16.600
They landed you the
cover. Are you in?

00:16.642 --> 00:17.893
Absolutely.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.019
NAVID:
I knew I recognized her.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.228
That girl, Kaitlyn,
is a junior.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.315
Which means my dad put
an underage girl in his movie.

00:25.985 --> 00:28.111
ANNIE:
History is largely told

00:28.153 --> 00:31.198
as a chronicle of great people
doing great things.

00:31.239 --> 00:35.285
But, for most of us, life
is not made up of big moments.

00:35.327 --> 00:37.621
It's made up of small moments.

00:39.289 --> 00:44.085
And with every small choice,
with every small decision,

00:44.127 --> 00:46.296
we are defining ourselves.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.302
♪ ♪

00:52.344 --> 00:54.304
Are we proud of ourselves,

00:54.346 --> 00:57.725
or are we disappointed
by who we've become?

00:57.766 --> 01:01.395
Life rarely turns out
the way that we plan.

01:03.689 --> 01:07.275
The unexpected happens,
and it surprises us

01:07.317 --> 01:10.195
with new and exciting
possibilities.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.782
(school bell ringing)

01:13.824 --> 01:15.283
Yo, Oscar.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.328
But, sooner or later,
reality hits you in the face.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.466
Okay, guys.
What do you think of this one?

01:31.508 --> 01:34.093
You look... happy.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.304
I like your hair.
The dress is a no-go.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.016
You're supposed to be walking
a red carpet, not wearing one.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.392
What?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.978
People love me for my
honesty and candor.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.145
Who are these
people exactly?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.481
ANNIE:
Hey.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.025
Try this one.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.192
Ooh, that's pretty.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.485
I'll be right back.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.404
You know, Ade...

01:52.446 --> 01:54.155
you know, we really
have to work

01:54.197 --> 01:55.490
on your posing.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.743
I mean, I know you did
that magazine cover and all,

01:57.785 --> 02:00.161
but on the red carpet,
there's... (chuckles)

02:00.203 --> 02:02.247
no Photoshopping,
if you know what I'm saying.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.000
It's all about angles.

02:05.042 --> 02:09.378
I actually would suggest the
over-the-shoulder eye smolder.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.631
ADRIANNA:
The what?

02:10.672 --> 02:13.008
Ass out, head over shoulder,
purse your lips

02:13.050 --> 02:15.343
and smolder those peepers.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.680
ADRIANNA: All right.
What do you think?

02:18.722 --> 02:19.890
SILVER:
Ooh.

02:19.932 --> 02:22.601
ANNIE:
Ah. So gorgeous.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.813
I'd do you.
(laughs)

02:25.854 --> 02:28.649
Now, smolder.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.567
(cell phone ringing)
Oh.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.945
One second.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.196
Uh, this is really not
a good time.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.198
Why? I'm not busy.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.994
Anyway, what do you think
about Joe Jonas?

02:40.035 --> 02:41.202
Joe Jonas?

02:41.244 --> 02:42.997
I think he's amazing.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.289
Good, 'cause he's going to be

02:44.331 --> 02:45.707
your date
for the magazine party.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.375
Um, I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.711
I'm going to bring Navid.
Who the hell is that?

02:49.753 --> 02:51.672
Navid, my boyfriend.
You've met him.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.091
No, no, no, no, sweetheart.
I know who he is.

02:54.133 --> 02:57.260
That was the press after you
introduce Navid as your date.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.470
"Who the hell is that?"

02:58.512 --> 02:59.805
You need to go with someone

02:59.847 --> 03:01.264
who's going to boost
your profile.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.433
Okay, well, I already
promised him, so I... I can't.

03:03.475 --> 03:04.893
Are we still having
this conversation?

03:04.935 --> 03:07.228
This isn't prom;
this is a major media event.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.397
You're going with Joe Jonas.
The end.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.816
(dial tone drones)

03:13.777 --> 03:15.029
(sighs)

03:19.741 --> 03:23.954
So the person you admire the
most is Margaret Thatcher? Huh?

03:23.996 --> 03:27.875
Well, uh, I did a lot
of research, and she seems to be

03:27.916 --> 03:29.918
the kind of person
that colleges really respond to.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.210
Colleges want to
get to know you.

03:31.252 --> 03:32.462
They don't want
to get to know

03:32.504 --> 03:33.922
who you think they
think you should be.

03:33.964 --> 03:34.923
Oh.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.758
But I love the
connection you made

03:36.800 --> 03:38.760
between the Falklands War
and your battle with acne

03:38.802 --> 03:40.637
in the ninth grade.
It was...

03:40.679 --> 03:41.889
it was really memorable.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.807
Start from scratch, huh?

03:43.849 --> 03:46.434
Just be yourself,
and they'll be crazy about you,

03:46.476 --> 03:48.020
just the way I am.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.362
Hey, Jen?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.412
Okay. Why exactly

04:05.453 --> 04:08.289
does our son look like a
miniature Robespierre?

04:08.331 --> 04:09.791
It's chic, right?
Yeah.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.668
I'm coordinating our outfits
for the trunk show tomorrow.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.628
Yeah, what are you going as,
Marie Antoinette?

04:16.005 --> 04:17.382
(sniffing)

04:17.423 --> 04:19.426
(sighs) Oh, no.

04:19.466 --> 04:20.761
Jacques, no.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.097
Not in the tweed trousers.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.305
RYAN:
It's okay, Jack.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.766
I'd do the same
thing if she

04:25.807 --> 04:27.226
made me wear a
suit at home.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.852
Oh, God.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.353
Here. You do it.
Okay.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.648
I don't want to risk ruining
both of our outfits.
Sure.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.400
You know,
this is a total debacle.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.485
There's no way I can get those
dry-cleaned by tomorrow.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.863
Yeah, so what
is a trunk show anyway?

04:39.905 --> 04:41.073
I'm guessing you're
not buying clothes

04:41.115 --> 04:42.699
out of the back
of an old Cadillac.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.785
It's a first look at next
season's new baby fashions.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.661
Every mother in Beverly Hills
with a black card

04:46.703 --> 04:48.538
will be at the beach
club for the show.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.873
I'm going to make
all sorts of BFFs.

04:49.915 --> 04:50.958
That sounds fun--

04:50.999 --> 04:52.459
uh, meeting some other mothers.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.336
Well, I'm hoping to get
some parenting tips.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.504
Sure. Cool.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.506
Like about diapers.

04:58.548 --> 04:59.800
What, like, uh, cloth
or disposable?

04:59.841 --> 05:02.510
Is there any way around babies
wearing them?

05:02.552 --> 05:05.180
They make his bottom
look all poofy,

05:05.222 --> 05:07.682
and they totally ruin the line
of his clothes.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.102
I mean, Ryan,
you know it's true.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.190
DIXON:
Come on.

05:19.111 --> 05:20.946
Okay. (chuckles)

05:20.988 --> 05:22.572
What was that for?

05:22.614 --> 05:23.865
ANNIE:
You've got mail.

05:23.907 --> 05:25.575
College apps are not going
to fill themselves out.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.535
Have you even thought
about where you want to go yet?

05:27.577 --> 05:28.870
Yeah, definitely.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.664
Somewhere with beachfront access

05:30.705 --> 05:33.208
and a women's mud
wrestling team.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.419
(chuckles) Glad to see you
have your priorities straight.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.216
Oh, my God.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.384
What, did you find a place
that will let you

05:43.426 --> 05:46.096
major in Jay-Z
and minor in bikini models?

05:46.138 --> 05:47.514
No.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.932
What?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.809
This was addressed to Mom.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.228
I... I opened it by accident.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.437
What is it?

05:55.647 --> 05:57.440
Dixon, what?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.485
It's divorce papers.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.362
(sighs)
I don't believe it.

06:03.404 --> 06:04.614
I know.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.950
I mean, Mom still wears
her wedding ring.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.536
What do you think that means?

06:09.577 --> 06:11.038
Hey, maybe it means

06:11.079 --> 06:12.455
that she still hopes
that they're going

06:12.497 --> 06:14.624
to get back together.
Yeah.

06:14.666 --> 06:18.128
Yeah, uh, I mean, why else
would she still wear it, right?

06:18.170 --> 06:20.421
Yeah. And...
and do you think Dad

06:20.463 --> 06:22.423
even knows
that she still wears the ring?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.592
(sighs) Probably not.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.178
Well, we need to tell him.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.397
You going to keep poking
at your plate, or you going

06:38.439 --> 06:40.067
to tell me
what's going on?

06:41.609 --> 06:43.444
Well, there is something
that I need to talk

06:43.486 --> 06:46.114
to you about, Dad, but it's...
it's not easy for me to say.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.866
What? What's wrong?
Well, uh...

06:49.826 --> 06:51.786
I saw some of
your movies.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.788
Uh, your...
your work movies.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.456
Yeah?
Yeah.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.458
Is this about masturbation?
No, it's not...

06:57.500 --> 06:59.294
Because masturbation,
Navid,
Dad, it's not about
masturbation.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.922
it's a very
natural thing...
Shh!

07:01.963 --> 07:04.465
Okay, it's not
about that, Dad.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.467
No, I saw some
of your movies,

07:06.509 --> 07:08.469
and I saw this
girl at school,

07:08.511 --> 07:10.513
and she just... she looked
really, really familiar,

07:10.555 --> 07:11.806
and I couldn't
figure out how.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.226
And then I realized...

07:14.268 --> 07:16.644
she's one
of your actresses, Dad.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.979
Her name is Kaitlyn.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.857
She goes by the name
of... Jade St. James.

07:20.899 --> 07:24.194
Anyway, she goes to my school,

07:24.236 --> 07:26.988
which means that she's underage.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.740
You're sure about this?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.242
Positive.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.830
Thank you for telling me, Navid.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.124
I don't know
how this happened.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.792
You did the right thing
to tell me.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.294
I'm going
to straighten this out.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.836
(sighs)

07:41.878 --> 07:43.504
Thanks, Dad.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.257
Yeah.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.803
Hey, hey!

07:49.844 --> 07:52.055
What's up?

07:52.097 --> 07:53.848
How was lunch?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.892
Went better than I thought.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.103
I just cannot wait
to get in the water.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.646
Getting your ankles
wet doesn't count.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.190
Are you ever going to get over
seeing that movie, Open Water?

08:02.232 --> 08:05.193
Dude, whatever, man.
Sharks are a very real threat.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.403
I think you're
safe, buddy.

08:06.445 --> 08:08.196
Hey, I didn't expect
to see you here.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.530
Got a day off
from driving Miss Daisy?

08:09.572 --> 08:10.824
Daisy took a cab.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.492
She had a full afternoon
of purse business,

08:12.533 --> 08:13.743
and she knows
the rules, man.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.412
I deal with her,
but not the drugs.

08:15.454 --> 08:16.955
I still can't believe
that girl deals.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.207
It's not even like she
needs the money.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.001
I... I swear I'll never
understand rich kids.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.003
Trying to understand
rich kids is like

08:23.044 --> 08:24.254
trying to understand
LeBron James.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.506
The more you talk about
it, the angrier you get.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.757
He should have stayed
in Cleveland.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.550
No, no, it... look,
it's not about loyalty.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.594
All right? It's about winning
those titles, all right?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.554
Whoa, whoa, wait. Are you sure
you want to mess with Dixon?

08:33.596 --> 08:34.597
'Cause you heard
about what happened

08:34.639 --> 08:35.722
to the last guy
that pissed him of.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.308
Right. Hey, please don't
punch me, Dixon.

08:37.351 --> 08:38.558
Yeah.
Hey, bro,
I'll give you

08:38.601 --> 08:39.769
my lunch money,
okay?
Very funny.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.562
Here take it...
Shut up, all right?

08:41.604 --> 08:45.566
For real, though,
why'd you hit Oscar?

08:45.608 --> 08:50.071
Ivy had sex with Oscar the night
of the Bachelor Auction.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.365
Are you serious?

08:51.406 --> 08:52.573
Ah, dude, no way.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.493
Yeah.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.415
Yo.

09:00.457 --> 09:01.624
Hey.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.834
Hey, Ivy.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.592
Uh, Dixon, can
I talk to you?

09:11.634 --> 09:13.553
Alone?

09:14.721 --> 09:15.847
Later, man.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.849
See ya.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.100
(sighs)

09:19.142 --> 09:20.435
Okay, Dixon, look,

09:20.477 --> 09:22.437
I'm sorry, okay?
For everything.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.189
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.648
I never meant to hurt you.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.651
You dumped me.
I felt rejected.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.778
I was in this really
messed up spot,

09:30.820 --> 09:32.280
and, no, it's
not an excuse,

09:32.322 --> 09:33.948
and I know that.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.118
But you have... you have to
know that I still love you.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.749
Yeah, well... you should have
thought of that before.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.887
(touch-tone dialing)

09:55.929 --> 09:58.265
Is that a mirage, or
is that really you?

09:58.306 --> 09:59.433
(laughs)

09:59.474 --> 10:01.518
Your phone was going
straight to voice mail,

10:01.560 --> 10:03.144
so I thought I'd just come.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.312
Ah.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.730
Do you want to go for dinner?

10:05.772 --> 10:08.358
Yeah. Sounds great.
What's the catch?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.235
You're going to make me
wear some goofy suit

10:10.277 --> 10:11.486
to the party, aren't you?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.280
Aw, does it have epaulets?

10:13.321 --> 10:15.240
I told you, anything
but epaulets. It-it...

10:15.282 --> 10:17.451
made me look like a
figure skater, and...

10:17.492 --> 10:20.161
No epaulets, okay?
You can wear whatever you want.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.539
Mmm.

10:22.581 --> 10:23.957
Um, but the thing is,

10:23.998 --> 10:26.334
we can totally hang out
together at the party...

10:26.376 --> 10:27.502
Mm-hmm.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.629
...but I can't
take you as my date.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.548
Oh, why not?

10:32.840 --> 10:34.801
Victor wants me
to go with Joe Jonas.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.679
As your date?

10:38.721 --> 10:40.390
Well, he's not my real date.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.392
It's a publicity
appearance.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.769
Look, we just have
to walk the carpet together.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.229
Victor pulled some strings.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.982
I don't really
have a choice.
Yeah, you do, Ade.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.400
No, I don't!

10:50.442 --> 10:52.693
Victor said I had to do it.
Okay, you know what?

10:52.735 --> 10:54.821
I'm sick of hearing
Victor's name.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.239
Navid.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.325
No, just stop.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.201
(car door closes)

11:00.243 --> 11:02.078
(engine revving)

11:02.120 --> 11:04.122
Navid, don't.

11:30.273 --> 11:33.527
MICHELLE:
He seems so happy.
Did he keep you up last night?

11:33.568 --> 11:35.195
ALICE:
Yeah. How about you?

11:35.236 --> 11:38.198
Oh, I will tell you
four hours of sleep
would be a luxury

11:38.239 --> 11:40.158
for me at this point.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.243
Oh, sleep deprivation
is the worst.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.162
Oh, and breastfeeding... oh!

11:44.204 --> 11:46.247
Oh, my God, how barbaric

11:46.289 --> 11:47.582
is breastfeeding?

11:47.624 --> 11:50.835
Save it for National Geographic,
right? (chuckles)

11:50.877 --> 11:53.046
Um, I was gonna say that

11:53.087 --> 11:54.881
breastfeeding
can be exhausting,

11:54.922 --> 11:56.883
but it's also
an incredibly beautiful thing

11:56.924 --> 11:58.593
that a mother can do
for her child.

11:58.635 --> 11:59.594
(baby cries)

11:59.636 --> 12:01.720
Quiet, Jacques.

12:01.762 --> 12:03.014
Shh.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.850
(crying continues)

12:05.892 --> 12:07.018
(chuckles nervously)

12:07.060 --> 12:08.269
Oh, it's okay.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.771
Stop crying.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.399
Are those leather pants
he's wearing?

12:12.440 --> 12:15.151
Quiet!
They look hot.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.903
Thanks.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.613
No, no, I mean hot hot.

12:18.655 --> 12:20.031
Like excessively warm?

12:20.073 --> 12:22.867
Well, we all suffer
for fashion, don't we?

12:22.909 --> 12:25.245
Jacques, it's okay.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.081
He never does this ever.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.290
Want me to try?

12:29.332 --> 12:30.333
No.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.587
Let me try.
Let me just... Here.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.213
Oh...

12:35.255 --> 12:36.715
Hey, there.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.799
(woman cooing)

12:38.841 --> 12:40.801
That's a good
little fella.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.011
(crying ceases)

12:42.053 --> 12:44.097
Oh, hi.

12:44.138 --> 12:47.475
Isn't he a good little fella?

12:47.517 --> 12:51.605
Oh, well, I was gonna try
that next.

12:51.646 --> 12:55.149
That bouncing thing
you're doing.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.943
He's asleep now.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.862
Good. Perfect.

13:04.492 --> 13:07.621
Hi. Um, I wanted to thank you

13:07.662 --> 13:09.122
for your help with Cannon.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.082
Great.
How about tonight at dinner?

13:11.124 --> 13:13.084
What?
You said you wanted to thank me.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.793
I suggested you could do it
over dinner.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.589
Pick you up at 8:00?
No, I have Adrianna's magazine
party tonight.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.466
I love parties.
8:00 still good?

13:19.507 --> 13:21.301
First of all, it starts
at 6:00, and secondly...

13:21.342 --> 13:22.927
Well, 5:45.
I'll be at your door.

13:22.969 --> 13:23.928
Oscar...

13:23.970 --> 13:25.888
Hold that thought till tonight.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.975
(frustrated sigh)

13:29.016 --> 13:31.018
Come on, dude you have
to pick one.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.146
Dude, I'm not picking.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.648
You're a nerd,
you know that?

13:34.689 --> 13:35.982
Yes, I'm aware.
Pick.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.401
Okay, fine, if I had to pick...

13:38.443 --> 13:40.153
I'd want to be able to fly.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.530
Over being invisible?
Are you kidding me?

13:42.572 --> 13:44.658
Have you ever fully imagined
being invisible?

13:44.699 --> 13:47.034
Dude, the locker room potential
alone can get you...

13:47.076 --> 13:48.703
Psst! Hey, you.
What you guys doing?

13:48.745 --> 13:51.830
You want to grab pizza
or something after school?

13:51.872 --> 13:54.041
Um, I don't really
think I can today.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.336
Yeah, I got some homework.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.463
You guys cool?
You're acting mad weird.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.340
Like, more than usual.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.882
No, it's just that

14:01.924 --> 14:03.677
everything that
happened between,

14:03.718 --> 14:05.553
you know, you and Dixon, uh...

14:05.595 --> 14:08.640
Yeah, okay, cool.

14:08.682 --> 14:09.848
Get it.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.268
No worries. I'll catch
you guys later.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.271
Invisible.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.448
Stop!

14:25.490 --> 14:27.784
Jen, please stop!

14:27.826 --> 14:29.035
What, did I forget

14:29.076 --> 14:30.036
to pay for something?

14:30.077 --> 14:32.205
You took the wrong baby!

14:32.246 --> 14:34.708
Oh, Sophie,
my darling Sophie.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.000
Sweetheart.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.419
Come here. Come here.
Come here. It's okay.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.879
I'm so sorry. I...

14:39.920 --> 14:42.549
Sweetie, it's okay.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.884
It's okay, honey.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.135
Sorry, Jacques.

14:48.596 --> 14:52.141
Well, I guess that's what we get
for having the same stroller.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.200
You okay?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.160
Uh, yeah, fine.

15:14.455 --> 15:15.874
You don't look fine.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.084
Thank you.

15:20.503 --> 15:23.757
Here, use this.

15:23.798 --> 15:27.134
It'll help cover your blotchy
patches and undereye circles.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.846
(scoffs) That's kind of why
I'm not friends with girls

15:29.888 --> 15:31.848
'cause you guys they think
that coverup is

15:31.890 --> 15:33.516
the answer to everything,
and it's not.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.769
(compact snaps shut)

15:35.810 --> 15:37.353
Okay. Keep your blotches.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.608
I hope you're happy.

15:41.649 --> 15:42.734
What?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.985
Thanks to you, I just got fired.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.153
You know, I have
car insurance,

15:46.195 --> 15:47.614
not to mention
college to pay for.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.073
Well, maybe you should
get a job

15:49.115 --> 15:50.784
at the Beverly Center,
like a normal kid.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.327
Oh, please, like you have
any idea what it's like

15:53.369 --> 15:54.746
to be a normal kid.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.081
You live in a mansion
and you drive a Ferrari.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.332
Okay, whatever.
You know what?

15:58.374 --> 15:59.876
You shouldn't have lied
about your age, okay?

15:59.918 --> 16:02.420
You know you could have gotten
my dad in some serious trouble.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.963
I could have gotten your dad
in trouble?

16:04.004 --> 16:06.090
Yeah.
You think he didn't know

16:06.132 --> 16:09.886
I was underage? He knew.
And I'm not the only one.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.853
(computer trilling)

16:21.021 --> 16:22.982
Hey, perfect timing.

16:23.023 --> 16:24.609
I'm scoring the
Principal Nowack segment,

16:24.651 --> 16:27.695
but I can't tell if the Jaws
theme is just too on the nose.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.238
You want to take a listen
and...?

16:30.657 --> 16:31.950
Hey, what is it?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.535
Oh, I spoke to my dad,

16:34.577 --> 16:36.913
and he said he didn't know
Kaitlyn was underage.

16:36.955 --> 16:40.374
She said he totally did
and that she's not the only one.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.376
What do you think?

16:42.418 --> 16:44.128
I don't know what to think
anymore.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.924
I'm so sorry. I wish there was
something I could do to help.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.302
What?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.847
Why are you looking at me
like that?

16:57.809 --> 16:59.435
Hi.

16:59.477 --> 17:00.770
Hi!

17:02.146 --> 17:05.065
You must be Dixon and Annie.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.776
Your father showed me pictures.

17:10.112 --> 17:11.571
Um, nice to meet you.

17:11.614 --> 17:13.574
I'm Katie.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.661
I guess your dad didn't tell you
about me, did he?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.788
I'm your dad's... friend.

17:18.829 --> 17:21.499
Gotcha.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.501
So, is our dad home?

17:23.542 --> 17:25.752
No, but he'll be back in
about a half hour.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.463
Do you want
to come inside and wait?

17:27.505 --> 17:31.676
Uh, no, no, we-we actually
gotta get going.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.512
Yeah, we should
get home for dinner.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.347
But we were just
in the neighborhood

17:36.389 --> 17:37.849
and thought we'd,
you know,

17:37.891 --> 17:39.350
come by and say hi.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.602
So, could you
tell him hi?

17:41.644 --> 17:43.270
No problem.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.856
It was really nice meeting you.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.777
(Dixon chuckles
uneasily)

17:49.819 --> 17:50.820
Uh, you, too.

17:58.494 --> 18:02.874
Hey, how'd it go
with your new BFFs?

18:02.916 --> 18:05.084
Huh. I wouldn't be friends
with those women

18:05.125 --> 18:06.502
if my life depended on it.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.588
They were boring
and gauche,

18:08.629 --> 18:10.798
and they dressed
their babies off the rack.

18:10.840 --> 18:11.841
All right.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.133
(crying)

18:13.175 --> 18:14.552
You want me to do it?

18:14.594 --> 18:17.638
No, I can change a diaper, Ryan.
I'm not an idiot.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.473
Okay, go ahead.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.976
Shh...

18:23.853 --> 18:25.229
Shh...

18:28.232 --> 18:31.110
Shh. Could you not hover?

18:32.028 --> 18:33.071
Shh.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.323
Oh, it's okay.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.742
(stops crying)

18:42.413 --> 18:44.415
(crying resumes)

18:45.083 --> 18:46.417
(thud)

18:46.459 --> 18:49.003
(gasps) Oh, my God! Ryan!

18:49.045 --> 18:50.504
(wailing)

18:50.546 --> 18:51.505
I'm sorry!

18:51.547 --> 18:52.506
What's wrong?

18:52.548 --> 18:53.549
I'm so sorry!

18:53.591 --> 18:54.842
What happened?
Oh, my God!

18:54.884 --> 18:57.177
(sobbing):
I was just changing him,

18:57.219 --> 18:59.305
and I turned away
for one second.

18:59.346 --> 19:01.015
It was just one second,
and he fell.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.017
No, he's fine. Come here.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.727
Shh-shh-shh.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.020
Oh, my God!

19:06.062 --> 19:08.606
But what if I
hurt him, Ryan?

19:08.648 --> 19:09.857
He's fine.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.358
I'm a terrible mother!

19:11.400 --> 19:14.278
You're not a terrible mother.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.407
Babies shouldn't
wear leather, Ryan,

19:18.449 --> 19:19.533
and I said breastfeeding

19:19.575 --> 19:21.535
was from National Geographic!

19:21.577 --> 19:25.915
No wonder he liked
that other mother more than me.

19:25.957 --> 19:27.917
Come here.
Look at me.
Come on.

19:27.959 --> 19:31.879
You're the most important
person in Jack's life, okay?

19:31.921 --> 19:34.799
What just happened has
no bearing on that.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.634
You're his mother,
which means

19:36.676 --> 19:38.260
that you're gonna have more
of an effect on him

19:38.302 --> 19:40.138
than anybody else, okay?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.139
You're the person

19:41.180 --> 19:42.556
who's gonna make him the man

19:42.598 --> 19:43.724
that he will be one day.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.894
And he's lucky
to have you, Jen.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.146
(cooing)

19:58.906 --> 20:01.450
Is this some
new dance craze?
I like it.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.285
No, no, I was in a rush.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.080
I didn't have time
to dry my nails at the spa.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.498
You got your nails done
for our date?

20:07.540 --> 20:08.582
It is not a date.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.209
Fine. Rendezvous.
(sighs)

20:10.250 --> 20:12.003
I'll see you at 5:45.

20:12.045 --> 20:15.840
Ah! You smudge,
I will kill you.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.008
(blows air)

20:22.805 --> 20:24.264
Wait.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.809
What do you want?
What's going on

20:26.851 --> 20:28.102
between you and Oscar?

20:28.144 --> 20:29.812
Why? Are you jealous?

20:29.854 --> 20:32.648
No, I'm not...
Look, Naomi, you know,

20:32.690 --> 20:34.650
you might be shallow
and manipulative

20:34.692 --> 20:36.694
and incredibly narcissistic...

20:36.736 --> 20:38.988
I'm not going to stand here
and be insulted, okay?

20:39.030 --> 20:40.698
Okay, listen,
but you're not evil.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.116
And Oscar is evil.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.368
So you need
to stay away from him.

21:04.471 --> 21:06.640
Hi. I'm Silver.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.102
Ooh! I like it!

21:09.143 --> 21:10.103
What's your real name?

21:10.144 --> 21:12.688
Uh, it's... Silver.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.149
I love the commitment
to your craft.
(chuckles)

21:15.191 --> 21:17.151
I'm Holly. Holly Woodlove.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.318
Nice to meet you, Holly.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.403
You as well.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.490
This is my first audition.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.367
I'm super excited
to get into porn.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.660
Ooh, don't be too excited.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.704
I know it looks
totally glamorous,

21:28.746 --> 21:31.207
but it can be really
hard sometimes.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.332
What's your specialty?

21:32.374 --> 21:34.334
Uh, y-you know,

21:34.376 --> 21:36.629
a little of this, a lot of that.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.713
I do everything.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.715
Ooh. Impressive.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.843
You know, um,
there is one thing

21:42.885 --> 21:44.553
that I'm kind of nervous about.

21:44.595 --> 21:47.056
Okay, sweetie,
it is no big deal.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.891
They need some girls
with small boobs, too.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.852
Uh... oh, good.

21:51.894 --> 21:54.021
But another thing, um--

21:54.063 --> 21:57.357
(whispering):
see, I'm not exactly 18 yet.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.525
Doesn't matter.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.654
They take anything
that looks like an I.D.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.948
Really?
Yeah, I started when I was 17.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.285
Okay, go downtown
and buy a fake.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.536
Doesn't even have to look real.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.664
Honestly, these people
do not care.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.624
Silver?

22:13.666 --> 22:15.168
We're ready for you.

22:15.209 --> 22:16.919
HOLLY:
Ah, it's your turn.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.754
(giggles)

22:20.923 --> 22:22.716
Um, actually, I'm so stupid.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.385
I left my-my, uh, my paperwork
in the car.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.553
So, um, I'll be back.

22:26.595 --> 22:29.056
Holly Woodlove.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.487
I'm sorry.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.081
Hey, you're late.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.541
I was starting
to get worried.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.168
Um, sorry, Mom.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.336
Sit down.

22:58.376 --> 22:59.419
We need to talk.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.880
(sighs)

23:00.921 --> 23:03.716
So I guess you saw these?

23:03.757 --> 23:05.885
Uh, I-I opened
those by accident.

23:05.926 --> 23:06.886
I'm so sorry.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.179
Oh, no, don't worry.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.638
I should have
told you earlier.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.266
I know the idea of divorce
must be unsettling,

23:12.308 --> 23:14.643
but we all knew
this day would come.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.394
Right.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.814
What's going on?

23:18.856 --> 23:21.483
Um, well...

23:21.525 --> 23:23.986
after we saw
the divorce papers,

23:24.028 --> 23:26.697
we were really surprised,
so we went to see Dad.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.574
To see if there
was any hope left.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.159
Oh, you shouldn't
have done that.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.744
Yeah, no kidding.

23:32.536 --> 23:33.704
What?

23:37.415 --> 23:39.085
Dad's seeing someone.

23:44.715 --> 23:45.674
I know.

23:45.716 --> 23:47.551
I didn't say anything

23:47.593 --> 23:49.595
because I thought
you'd be upset.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.390
Are you?

23:52.430 --> 23:54.934
No, just a little weirded out.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.518
Super weirded out.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.436
But-but we're okay.

23:58.478 --> 24:00.480
I know it's hard to see him
with somebody new,

24:00.522 --> 24:03.692
but try to find a way
to be happy for him.

24:03.734 --> 24:07.238
And I'm here
if you want to talk.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.364
Okay?

24:08.406 --> 24:09.407
Okay.

24:09.447 --> 24:10.824
Okay.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.622
JEN:
Shh.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.042
NAOMI (singsongy):
Hello!

24:20.084 --> 24:21.919
(whispers):
Hi.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.503
(whispers):
Oh.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.923
There's my little
Jacques in the box.

24:25.965 --> 24:26.924
(chuckles)

24:26.966 --> 24:29.218
So cute.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.552
Oh.

24:30.594 --> 24:31.887
I got your message.

24:31.929 --> 24:32.972
What's up?

24:33.013 --> 24:34.681
Oh.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.062
Well, here are the
shoes that I thought

24:40.104 --> 24:41.230
you might want to
borrow tonight.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.732
Um, you said I couldn't
borrow your shoes

24:43.774 --> 24:45.776
'cause my bunions
would ruin your toe box.

24:45.818 --> 24:46.902
Wha-- I never
said that.

24:46.944 --> 24:47.903
Yes, you did.

24:47.945 --> 24:48.946
You--

24:48.988 --> 24:49.989
I mean, whatever.

24:50.030 --> 24:50.990
Thank you.

24:51.031 --> 24:52.574
You like?

24:52.616 --> 24:55.077
I love them. I will make sure
to bring them back unharmed.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.078
Take your time.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.164
And here's a house key.

24:58.205 --> 25:01.125
From now on, my closet
is your closet.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.086
Um, thank you.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.755
Plus, now you can come see
Jacques whenever you like.

25:06.797 --> 25:07.840
(Jacques cooing)

25:10.301 --> 25:12.386
(gasps)
You'd better get going.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.096
You don't want to be
late for the party.

25:14.138 --> 25:16.015
Oh, yeah. Okay,
I'll see you there.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.515
Oh, no, no. I'm not--
I'm not coming.

25:17.557 --> 25:20.311
I'm going to just spend
some time with Jacques.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.855
Well, okay.

25:22.896 --> 25:25.065
Um, I don't blame you.
He's a darling.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.360
Then I will make sure
to see you tomorrow.
Yes.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.071
Good-bye, Naomi.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.161
♪ ♪

25:37.203 --> 25:38.204
(knocking at door)

25:38.245 --> 25:40.039
Hello?
Anybody home?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.665
Hi!
Hi.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.958
I'm Joe Jonas.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.377
I mean, no, I'm not.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.462
Um, I mean... Oh, my God.
I'm Adrianna. Hey.

25:46.504 --> 25:48.339
That's okay.
Nice to meet you.

25:48.381 --> 25:50.548
Nice to meet
you. Uh...

25:50.590 --> 25:52.134
So thank you
for doing this.

25:52.176 --> 25:53.469
Not a problem.

25:53.511 --> 25:54.720
Besides, hopefully, it'll
get rid of all the rumors

25:54.761 --> 25:56.013
that I'm dating
Lady Gaga.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.681
My mom's kind of
freaked out about that one.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.976
Yeah. So how does this
sort of thing work?

26:01.018 --> 26:02.436
We just walk
the carpet together,

26:02.478 --> 26:04.813
hold hands,
if you're cool with that.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.732
Yeah.
And if they ask us

26:06.773 --> 26:08.984
about our relationship,
we keep it vague.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.652
All right.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.570
But the real question:

26:12.612 --> 26:14.698
Which tie do you think?
Because I have no idea.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.783
Uh, definitely
that one.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.827
Yeah?
Would you hurry up?

26:18.869 --> 26:20.746
Joe is wait--
Oh, Joe.

26:20.787 --> 26:24.041
(laughs)
I see you two have already met.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.251
Joe, you look great.

26:25.292 --> 26:27.336
Me? Adrianna's the one
who looks great.

26:27.378 --> 26:29.880
Uh, does she?
Yeah.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.424
No. You know what?
I don't like you in white.

26:31.465 --> 26:32.841
Go put
the black dress on.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.593
Hey, Joe. Really looking
forward to your new album.

26:35.635 --> 26:36.678
I already pre-ordered it

26:36.720 --> 26:40.057
on iTunes.
(clicks tongue)

26:40.099 --> 26:42.226
You're not going
to change, are you?

26:42.268 --> 26:43.519
(sighs)

26:43.561 --> 26:44.853
If you like the white one,
you should wear it.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.230
Ah, it's just a dress.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.314
You know, it doesn't
really matter.

26:47.356 --> 26:48.606
I like the black one, too.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.031
Ah.

26:56.073 --> 26:59.368
Pesare azizam.
What brings you here?

26:59.410 --> 27:01.036
You lied.

27:01.078 --> 27:04.039
My friend-- she came
here for an audition,

27:04.081 --> 27:06.166
and she found out how it
works at your company.

27:06.208 --> 27:07.418
So you spied on me?

27:07.460 --> 27:10.045
Only because I thought you
had something to hide.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.505
So I'll ask you again.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.091
Did you know that you were
hiring underage girls?

27:14.133 --> 27:17.010
I don't appreciate being
interrogated by my teenage son.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.387
Did you know?!

27:18.429 --> 27:19.430
Enough, Navid.

27:19.472 --> 27:20.722
No. Just answer
the question!

27:20.764 --> 27:22.391
Did you know?!

27:22.433 --> 27:23.725
(slaps desk)

27:23.767 --> 27:25.936
I'll tell you what I know.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.855
I know that you are
nothing but a child!

27:28.897 --> 27:32.734
A child who has had a very nice
life because of what I do!

27:32.776 --> 27:35.737
Now, why don't you
go enjoy your cars

27:35.779 --> 27:37.906
and your membership
at the Beach Club?!

27:37.948 --> 27:39.657
And leave the rest
of it to the grown-ups!

27:47.291 --> 27:51.003
Get the hell out of my office!

28:01.430 --> 28:02.598
(knocking at door)

28:02.640 --> 28:03.849
Come in!

28:05.142 --> 28:07.060
Navid. What a nice surprise!

28:07.102 --> 28:08.187
How are you?

28:08.228 --> 28:09.438
Mrs. Silverman,
uh, can you hold off

28:09.480 --> 28:11.106
on sending in my Stanford
application?

28:11.148 --> 28:13.900
I want to change my essay
on who I admire the most.

28:13.942 --> 28:16.153
But I love the essay you
wrote about your father.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.237
Yeah, well,

28:17.279 --> 28:18.905
I don't admire him anymore.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.949
Why the sudden change of heart?

28:20.991 --> 28:22.159
What's going
on, Navid?

28:22.201 --> 28:23.327
Is everything
okay at home?

28:23.369 --> 28:24.453
I don't want
to talk about it.

28:24.495 --> 28:25.912
So something
is wrong.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.414
Look, I'm your
guidance counselor.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.582
You can tell me anything.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.958
What's going on?
It's nothing.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.126
Well, clearly,
it's something.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.461
Did you and your father
have a fight?

28:32.503 --> 28:35.130
We didn't have a fight!

28:35.172 --> 28:38.717
I found out my dad is
a child pornographer, okay?

28:46.725 --> 28:49.144
(party music playing)

28:49.186 --> 28:51.813
OSCAR:
You look gorgeous tonight,
Naomi.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.733
Tonight? What do I
usually look like,

28:54.774 --> 28:56.318
a bowl of dog food?

28:56.360 --> 28:57.653
(laughs)
No.

28:57.695 --> 29:00.030
You never look like
a bowl of dog food.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.575
You're a spectacular woman.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.785
You really think so?

29:05.827 --> 29:07.538
You're extraordinary.

29:07.580 --> 29:08.997
Well...

29:09.039 --> 29:11.500
you have good taste in women.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.338
You know, Ivy warned me
to stay away from you.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.839
Ah.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.758
Did she?

29:22.595 --> 29:25.847
I mean, she's always been
jealous of me, so...

29:25.889 --> 29:28.517
Oh. I can see why.

29:30.394 --> 29:31.395
Um...

29:31.437 --> 29:33.564
Let's go somewhere else.

29:33.606 --> 29:37.025
I'd like to be
alone with you.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.827
(Debbie sighs)

29:50.247 --> 29:51.248
Hey.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.916
Hey. What are you doing here?

29:52.958 --> 29:54.876
Uh, Jen forced me to come.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.086
She said I'm becoming

29:56.128 --> 29:57.546
one of those obsessive
parents with no life.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.298
Ah. Well, since you're here,
can we figure out

29:59.339 --> 30:01.883
what nights next week
you're not gonna have a life?

30:01.925 --> 30:03.135
I need to finish
Jen's schedule.

30:03.176 --> 30:04.177
Sure.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.971
Okay, Jen
is busy on Monday,

30:06.012 --> 30:07.097
so can you
take Jacques?

30:07.139 --> 30:08.515
Oh. No, it's not Monday.

30:08.557 --> 30:11.226
It's Wednesday.
I think.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.812
You know, actually, maybe
it's Monday and Wednesday.

30:13.853 --> 30:15.230
Shoot. I cannot
find her calendar.

30:15.272 --> 30:16.607
You okay?

30:16.649 --> 30:20.402
Yeah, I'm just having
a little trouble concentrating.

30:20.444 --> 30:21.903
So, where were we?

30:21.945 --> 30:24.698
Uh, I think you were just
about to tell me what's wrong.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.283
I'm okay. I'm, I'm okay.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.286
Deb, Deb, please.
What's going on?

30:29.328 --> 30:32.414
(sniffles, chuckles wryly)

30:32.456 --> 30:34.458
I just found out
that Harry has a girlfriend,

30:34.500 --> 30:36.084
and I know that
I shouldn't care,

30:36.126 --> 30:37.210
but I do,
and the fact that I do

30:37.252 --> 30:38.629
makes me feel so pathetic.

30:38.671 --> 30:39.921
No, it's not pathetic.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.089
You were together a long time,

30:41.131 --> 30:42.257
you know? It's understandable.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.426
Yeah. And I had to find out
from the kids.

30:44.468 --> 30:45.803
How could he not tell me?

30:45.844 --> 30:48.388
It's like...
It's like I never existed.

30:48.430 --> 30:51.224
It's like the past 18 years
of my life didn't happen.

30:51.266 --> 30:52.434
Like they've just been erased.

30:52.476 --> 30:53.935
I mean, honestly,
what was it all for?

30:53.977 --> 30:56.062
Come here.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.357
(Debbie sobbing)

31:02.152 --> 31:03.821
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:03.862 --> 31:04.988
That's all right.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.117
I have an idea.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.994
(laughs)
I'll bet you do.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.288
We should go
skinny dipping.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.207
(both laugh)
I'll race you in.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.959
What do I get
if I win?

31:18.001 --> 31:19.503
Oh...

31:19.545 --> 31:21.046
Whatever you want.

31:21.087 --> 31:23.131
(laughs)

31:23.173 --> 31:25.050
Hey!

31:34.434 --> 31:37.103
I won! All right.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.980
Water's a bit cold.

31:39.022 --> 31:41.024
Come on, get in here
and keep me warm.

31:46.822 --> 31:48.824
Right. Well done.

31:48.866 --> 31:51.869
Very impressive.
Joke's on me.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.038
All right, now,
give me my clothes back.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.456
We'll call it even.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.292
Because this is all just
one big joke to you, isn't it?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.627
(laughs)

32:00.669 --> 32:03.004
No. That's not what I meant.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.758
Ivy, look, you're causing
a scene, all right?

32:05.799 --> 32:08.594
Oh, I'm sorry. What?
Something the matter, Oscar?

32:08.635 --> 32:09.678
You got something to hide?

32:12.765 --> 32:14.683
I'm, I'm sorry. All right?

32:14.725 --> 32:15.684
Just give me my
clothes back.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.185
Mm... no.

32:17.227 --> 32:19.897
No. Oscar, you're going
to have to grovel for this one.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.064
You can't be serious.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.107
Grovel.

32:22.148 --> 32:24.192
Or, you know,

32:24.234 --> 32:25.569
we could just
let the entire party

32:25.611 --> 32:26.862
see your cocktail frank.

32:28.572 --> 32:31.533
All right. Ivy, listen.

32:31.575 --> 32:32.910
Please. I'm sorry.

32:32.951 --> 32:36.204
I don't deserve
your forgiveness,

32:36.246 --> 32:38.206
but I'll work for it. All right?

32:39.291 --> 32:41.585
Honestly, Ivy, I'm sorry.

32:43.420 --> 32:46.590
I mean, that was actually...
That was actually pretty good.

32:47.758 --> 32:48.967
(whispers):
Just not good enough.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.221
(stammering): Wh-What...
Bloody hell, Ivy!

32:53.263 --> 32:54.306
What am I supposed to do here?!

32:55.557 --> 32:57.434
Enjoy the spotlight, darling.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.060
(girls laughing)

32:59.102 --> 33:00.103
You deserve it.

33:04.817 --> 33:08.069
What... What are you looking at?
Just go.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.947
It's funny?

33:18.831 --> 33:20.457
Hey.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.709
I was starting to think
you weren't going to show.

33:22.751 --> 33:23.752
Red carpet starts soon.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.587
You want to snark on
some outfits with me?

33:25.629 --> 33:26.630
No.

33:26.672 --> 33:27.756
Raincheck?

33:27.798 --> 33:29.549
What's going on?

33:29.591 --> 33:31.134
Did you talk to your Dad?

33:31.176 --> 33:32.594
Yeah.

33:32.636 --> 33:34.304
And...

33:34.346 --> 33:35.806
And, apparently,
I'm a spoiled, rich kid,

33:35.848 --> 33:38.224
who needs to shut
the hell up.
(sighs)

33:38.266 --> 33:40.310
That's... that's not true.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.895
Yeah, right.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.355
I mean that it's not,
it's not true.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.107
Come here.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.026
Come here.

33:51.655 --> 33:54.992
You don't deserve to
be treated that way.

34:09.214 --> 34:10.422
DIXON:
Yo!

34:10.465 --> 34:12.132
The red carpet's
about to start.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.301
You guys coming?

34:13.342 --> 34:14.678
Yeah.
Uh, yeah.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.721
Be right there.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.699
What's wrong?

34:35.741 --> 34:37.659
All of these people
are here for me?

34:37.701 --> 34:38.784
Well, what did you expect?

34:38.827 --> 34:41.038
I don't know-- not this.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.165
Hey. You're a star now.

34:44.206 --> 34:46.418
This is your night.
Enjoy it.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.545
Come on, you
look beautiful.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.464
Let's get out
there and wow them.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.886
(fans screaming and shouting)

34:55.928 --> 34:57.930
(whooping)

35:02.851 --> 35:04.561
There she is!
There she is!

35:07.898 --> 35:10.025
(paparazzi clamoring)

35:13.612 --> 35:14.905
(laughs)

35:14.947 --> 35:16.573
(whooping)

35:21.119 --> 35:22.704
PAPARAZZO:
Adrianna, Joe, can we get
a couple questions?!

35:22.746 --> 35:24.664
ADRIANNA:
Yeah, of course.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.875
Hey, you look beautiful,
Adrianna.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.167
ADRIANNA:
Thank you.

35:28.209 --> 35:31.004
How does it feel to get
your first magazine cover?

35:31.046 --> 35:33.214
Oh, it's a...
it's a dream come true.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.884
And how long have
you two been dating?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.305
Actually, Joe and I
are just friends.

35:41.598 --> 35:42.724
That's right.

35:42.766 --> 35:44.059
But I'm not dating Lady Gaga.

35:44.101 --> 35:45.393
You hear that, Mom?

35:45.435 --> 35:47.186
I'm not dating
Lady Gaga.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.563
Uh, this is my boyfriend.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.565
DIXON:
Dude, dude.
Hey.

35:50.607 --> 35:51.733
Dude, dude, go, go!

35:51.775 --> 35:53.318
What are you doing?

35:53.359 --> 35:54.402
(fans clamoring)

35:54.444 --> 35:55.862
ADRIANNA:
His name

35:55.904 --> 35:58.698
is Navid, ladies
and gentlemen,

35:58.740 --> 36:00.075
and he's

36:00.117 --> 36:01.576
the most amazing
person I know.

36:01.618 --> 36:04.121
PAPARAZZO:
By the way, congrats
on the YouTube hit.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.413
I mean, everybody's
talking about it.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.581
It's all about you.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.041
ADRIANNA:
I couldn't be happier.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.918
Thanks for having me.
Hey, have fun tonight?

36:09.960 --> 36:11.169
Shall we?
Yeah.
Yeah.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.174
(crickets chirping)

36:20.178 --> 36:22.139
You're working awfully late.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.100
I have some very disturbing
news about Navid Shirazi.

36:25.142 --> 36:27.268
Actually, it's
about his father.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.272
Whoo!
Hey, thank you.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.775
Really. I mean, thank you
for your help tonight.

36:33.817 --> 36:36.277
Oh, yeah. What Oscar
did to you was awful.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.613
I mean, you are
rude and abrasive,

36:38.655 --> 36:41.116
and in desperate
need of a makeover,

36:41.158 --> 36:43.451
but you didn't
deserve that.

36:43.493 --> 36:45.120
Yeah. Well, thank you.

36:45.162 --> 36:48.247
So, girls have a lot more
to offer than just cover up.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.125
Am I right? Hos before bros.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.960
Yeah, we should probably
make a T-shirt, huh?

36:52.002 --> 36:53.252
My God, that's a
really great idea.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.337
(phone rings)
Sorry.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.174
Um, weird. I have to go.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.466
No worries.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.552
All right. Well...

37:00.593 --> 37:02.345
hos before bros, be-yatch!

37:02.387 --> 37:04.139
(laughs)
High five?

37:04.181 --> 37:05.473
Well, don't leave me hanging!

37:05.515 --> 37:06.641
Yup. Sorry.

37:06.683 --> 37:08.309
Whatever it takes
to shut you up.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.519
(laughs)
Bye.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.104
I'm really sorry.

37:11.146 --> 37:13.982
I should have brought you
as my date in the first place.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.150
No, it's okay.

37:15.192 --> 37:16.317
Really?

37:16.359 --> 37:17.610
Sure.

37:17.652 --> 37:19.362
Whatever.

37:22.824 --> 37:24.701
Can I talk to you?

37:26.036 --> 37:27.620
Alone?

37:27.662 --> 37:28.788
(laughs)

37:28.830 --> 37:30.665
It'd be my pleasure.

37:30.707 --> 37:32.584
Hey, hey.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.670
I'll be right back, sweetie.

37:35.712 --> 37:38.173
You look great
in that.
Thank you.

37:38.215 --> 37:39.340
(laughs)

37:39.382 --> 37:40.508
Hey.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.677
So, what do you want
to talk to me about?

37:42.719 --> 37:44.137
What the hell
were you doing out there?

37:44.179 --> 37:47.348
You know, when I was walking
the red carpet,

37:47.390 --> 37:48.850
it suddenly hit me.

37:48.892 --> 37:52.062
I mean, all these people
are here for me.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.855
I'm famous.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.191
Hmm. You won't be
if I tell them the truth.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.525
Right.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.986
But if you destroy me,
I won't make any money,

38:00.028 --> 38:01.238
which means you won't, either.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.906
Mm-hmm.
And by the looks
of things,

38:02.948 --> 38:06.367
I'm gonna make a lot of money,
so you have a choice.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.661
You could expose me,

38:08.703 --> 38:11.706
or you can continue
being my manager

38:11.748 --> 38:13.917
on my terms.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.919
Fine.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.046
Oh, and one more thing.

38:18.088 --> 38:20.048
You will not be getting 80%.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.716
Managers usually get ten.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.301
You will get five.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.604
Hey. How's my college girl?

38:34.646 --> 38:35.855
(laughs)

38:35.897 --> 38:37.816
Not in college yet,
but one step closer.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.025
I just finished my essay.

38:39.067 --> 38:40.652
Can I read it to you?

38:40.693 --> 38:41.903
Oh, I would be honored.

38:41.945 --> 38:44.197
(laughs)
Okay.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.741
"History is largely told

38:46.783 --> 38:50.245
"as a chronicle of great people
doing great things.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.747
"But for most of us,

38:52.789 --> 38:55.583
"life is not made up
of big moments.

38:55.625 --> 38:57.585
It's made up of small moments."

38:57.627 --> 38:59.921
NAOMI:
Hello!

38:59.963 --> 39:02.841
Just me with
my new key!

39:05.969 --> 39:07.804
I got your text.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.931
Is everything okay?

39:09.973 --> 39:12.267
What's going on?

39:12.309 --> 39:14.727
"Dear Ryan, I'm so sorry.

39:14.769 --> 39:18.356
Jacques is better off
without me."?

39:18.397 --> 39:20.025
She left.

39:20.066 --> 39:23.153
She's gone.

39:23.195 --> 39:26.698
ANNIE:

39:26.739 --> 39:29.034
"with every small decision,

39:29.075 --> 39:31.369

39:31.410 --> 39:32.578

40:05.111 --> 40:07.488
"She found strength.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.157
"She moved on.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.993
"And I hope, when my life
doesn't go as I plan--

40:12.035 --> 40:14.495
"which it certainly won't--

40:14.537 --> 40:17.165
"I can handle myself
with the same grace and strength

40:17.207 --> 40:19.625
"that my mother
has taught me.

40:19.667 --> 40:22.128
"She may not be
an Olympic athlete

40:22.170 --> 40:25.340
"or a world leader, but my mom

40:25.382 --> 40:27.926
is definitely my hero."

40:29.552 --> 40:31.679

40:41.564 --> 40:43.691
(sighs)

40:43.733 --> 40:45.193
(sniffles)

40:45.235 --> 40:49.197
So, should I continue reading?

40:49.239 --> 40:53.492
In a minute. In a minute.
