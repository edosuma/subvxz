WEBVTT

00:02.990 --> 00:04.989
Julie: Johnny Mac is back
from the jury.

00:04.990 --> 00:07.989
James is back after getting off
the block.

00:07.990 --> 00:12.989
And the double eviction is back
to wreak havoc on the

00:12.990 --> 00:13.950
houseguests.

00:13.951 --> 00:15.699
Welcome to "Big Brother."

00:15.700 --> 00:22.989
( Cheers and applause )
>> Previously on "Big Brother":

00:22.990 --> 00:26.989
With the the poker player
holding all the cards...

00:26.990 --> 00:28.989
Vanessa is the new how far.

00:28.990 --> 00:33.989
She stayed loyal to Austin's
angels.

00:33.990 --> 00:39.289
But also made a side alliance
with John and Steve.

00:39.290 --> 00:44.989
Wanting to take out James.

00:44.990 --> 00:48.829
Vanessa made the best friends
block buddies.

00:48.830 --> 00:50.999
I nominated you, Meg, and
you, James.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.989
At the veto competition, it
was do or die for Meg and James.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.989
James and I have been put up
as this best friend duo.

00:59.990 --> 01:04.989
So we need to make sure that
this is the most bad-ass game of

01:04.990 --> 01:06.989
hide and seek I've ever played.

01:06.990 --> 01:08.989
And the country boy pulled it
out.

01:08.990 --> 01:09.990
Congratulations, James.

01:09.991 --> 01:12.999
You have won the golden power of
veto.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.989
Causing a huge blow to
Vanessa's master plan.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.949
This is the worst-case
scenario James being able to

01:20.950 --> 01:21.989
pull himself off the block.

01:21.990 --> 01:24.989
Now I have to find a replacement
nominee ask I have no idea what

01:24.990 --> 01:25.410
I'm going to do.

01:25.411 --> 01:32.989
Needing a replacement
nominee, aus-twins wanted Johnny

01:32.990 --> 01:33.990
Mac.

01:33.991 --> 01:36.699
But Vanessa wanted to protect
her secret alliance.

01:36.700 --> 01:39.989
I have this side deal that
they know nothing about with

01:39.990 --> 01:42.989
Johnny and I can't let them
realize I really want Johnny to

01:42.990 --> 01:43.990
stay in the game.

01:43.991 --> 01:46.989
So she pitched an unexpected
pawn.

01:46.990 --> 01:49.989
The only option that is smart
is you as a pawn.

01:49.990 --> 01:53.989
Unfortunately, that's the only
way I guarantee Meg goes.

01:53.990 --> 01:57.989
At the veto meeting...
>> I have decided to use the

01:57.990 --> 01:59.989
power of veto on myself.

01:59.990 --> 02:02.409
Vanessa initiated her plan to
get Meg out.

02:02.410 --> 02:04.989
Julia, please, take a seat.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.989
Tonight, will the house say
bon voyage to the new yorker or

02:08.990 --> 02:10.989
the Miami girl?

02:10.990 --> 02:13.989
Plus, strap in, sit back, and
get ready to rock because it's

02:13.990 --> 02:17.119
time for another double
eviction, baby.

02:17.120 --> 02:20.289
Before the hour is done, a
second houseguest will be sent

02:20.290 --> 02:20.990
to jury.

02:20.991 --> 02:24.989
All this live on "Big Brother."

02:24.990 --> 02:25.990
I can't.

02:25.991 --> 02:27.990
This is giving me
( Cheers and applause )

03:08.700 --> 03:09.989
Julie: Good evening.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.999
I'm Julie chen, and welcome to
the second double eviction of

03:13.000 --> 03:14.989
the summer.

03:14.990 --> 03:17.989
We are less than three weeks
away from crowning the winner of

03:17.990 --> 03:21.989
"Big Brother," and if the
houseguests ever needed to

03:21.990 --> 03:24.989
expect the unexpected, tonight
would be the night.

03:24.990 --> 03:29.989
By the the end of the hour, two
houseguests will be sent to the

03:29.990 --> 03:29.991
jury.

03:29.991 --> 03:33.989
So who will be the next two
houseguests to latest game?

03:33.990 --> 03:34.700
We'll soon find out.

03:34.701 --> 03:39.989
But first, since coming in to
the house together, the twins is

03:39.990 --> 03:44.289
have avoided being nominated for
eviction, until tonight, as

03:44.290 --> 03:46.949
Julia sits on the block next to
Meg.

03:46.950 --> 03:54.539
So will the others take this
chance to finally break up the

03:54.540 --> 04:01.950
aus-twins?

04:03.120 --> 04:05.989
There are plenty of people
that could go up this week who

04:05.990 --> 04:10.989
are huge threats in the house,
so thank you very much, Vanessa,

04:10.990 --> 04:12.699
for absolutely nothing.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.989
Sorry.

04:15.990 --> 04:16.990
But I love you.

04:16.991 --> 04:20.949
Wow, Vanessa really does want
me here this week.

04:20.950 --> 04:26.289
A week ago I was in the "big
brother" afterlife talking to

04:26.290 --> 04:26.990
julio.

04:26.991 --> 04:30.989
Now all of a sudden I'm
resurrected and not in danger of

04:30.990 --> 04:31.990
going out the door again.

04:31.991 --> 04:36.539
The bad news it smy only Ally
I have left in this house is

04:36.540 --> 04:41.289
sitting up on the block, but the
good news is Julia is up sitting

04:41.290 --> 04:41.990
next to her.

04:41.991 --> 04:43.989
If the "Big Brother"
houseguesting don't realize they

04:43.990 --> 04:48.989
could take a stab at Julia right
now, they're going to be missing

04:48.990 --> 04:52.989
out on an opportunity to break
up the Austin twin trio.

04:52.990 --> 04:55.999
Me and my sister are a huge
target.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.829
The other houseguests can see
this as a really good

04:58.830 --> 05:05.989
opportunity to take a shot at us
and get rid of me.

05:05.990 --> 05:09.989
I decided to use Julia as a
replacement nominee because

05:09.990 --> 05:12.989
Austin and Liz would vote to
keep her and I know Steve would

05:12.990 --> 05:13.990
also vote to keep her.

05:13.991 --> 05:18.119
I feel good about my decision.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.409
You okay?

05:19.410 --> 05:21.989
Oh, I'm just livid now.

05:21.990 --> 05:25.989
I know... I know it's... it
seems like your fate is sealed

05:25.990 --> 05:28.289
in stone, but there's been
people that's definitely had

05:28.290 --> 05:29.989
their back way more against the
wall.

05:29.990 --> 05:30.990
I know, I know.

05:30.991 --> 05:33.409
Anything can happen still.

05:33.410 --> 05:33.990
Uh-huh.

05:33.991 --> 05:40.989
You don't know what Steve and
Johnny Mac are thinking.

05:40.990 --> 05:43.989
They could see thises as an
opportunity to break up the

05:43.990 --> 05:44.120
three of them.

05:44.120 --> 05:44.990
Use this opportunity.

05:44.991 --> 05:48.999
I know.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.119
Pretty good spot.

05:50.120 --> 05:50.990
Yeah.

05:50.991 --> 05:53.989
But I need to piss some
people off on the jury, I think.

05:53.990 --> 05:57.289
So I need to make deals and
break them.

05:57.290 --> 05:59.989
If other houseguests are
thinking that I have a the loof

05:59.990 --> 06:02.989
friends on the jury, then that's
going to make me a big target

06:02.990 --> 06:04.989
when we're getting to fewer and
fewer people.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.989
I'm in the exact opposite
position.

06:07.990 --> 06:08.290
I need friends.

06:08.290 --> 06:08.990
Yeah.

06:08.991 --> 06:10.989
The whole jury hate me.

06:10.990 --> 06:14.989
This week, I mean, I went
against Austin and the twins.

06:14.990 --> 06:17.949
They really wanted you to go up
so I just wanted to show you

06:17.950 --> 06:20.989
please look at my actions and
don't let the other stuff get

06:20.990 --> 06:22.409
into your head like from before.

06:22.410 --> 06:24.989
I am down final two with you.

06:24.990 --> 06:24.991
Ditto.

06:24.991 --> 06:27.989
This is the only thing that
works for me right now.

06:27.990 --> 06:30.989
And, and we're covert.

06:30.990 --> 06:31.990
Nobody knows at all.

06:31.991 --> 06:34.989
Yeah Steve doesn't think we
get along.

06:34.990 --> 06:38.989
I actually think that that's
best to kind of as well.

06:38.990 --> 06:40.989
I don't think they see it
coming.

06:40.990 --> 06:41.990
That's for sure.

06:41.990 --> 06:42.990
I really don't think they do.

06:42.990 --> 06:43.990
We're close.

06:43.991 --> 06:45.989
Aren't we close?

06:45.990 --> 06:47.989
The end is near.

06:47.990 --> 06:52.990
It's insane.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.989
Like, we need to get a team
together.

07:08.990 --> 07:12.119
We're not going to make it if we
don't team up.

07:12.120 --> 07:13.989
Yeah.

07:13.990 --> 07:15.989
It might come to us.

07:15.990 --> 07:17.999
Let one of them go, and it
would be good for everybody

07:18.000 --> 07:19.989
because they control all the
votes right now.

07:19.990 --> 07:20.990
Yeah.

07:20.991 --> 07:25.989
They've got a big group.

07:25.990 --> 07:29.989
Is like, if Meg leaves, they'll
run us out of here.

07:29.990 --> 07:34.989
So it's just, like, splitting up
that three.

07:34.990 --> 07:38.989
If we're all in on this,
like, I think we actually could,

07:38.990 --> 07:40.989
like, save each other for a
couple of weeks.

07:40.990 --> 07:42.989
You know, give us all a
fighting chance.

07:42.990 --> 07:45.829
Yeah, there aren't too many
options at this point.

07:45.830 --> 07:45.990
Yeah.

07:45.991 --> 07:48.989
I've been wanting to do
something like this, this whole

07:48.990 --> 07:48.991
game.

07:48.991 --> 07:49.990
Let's go.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.989
Austin and the twins nominated
me and voted me out.

07:52.990 --> 07:53.990
This could be a huge move.

07:53.991 --> 07:57.989
I could get my revenge back, but
at the same time, Vanessa seems

07:57.990 --> 07:59.989
to want Meg out.

07:59.990 --> 08:02.989
This could sink my game, so what
do I do?

08:02.990 --> 08:03.990
We could really flip the house.

08:03.990 --> 08:04.990
Yeah.

08:04.991 --> 08:06.989
It will be a game changer.

08:06.990 --> 08:12.990
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.989
Do we need to talk?

08:17.990 --> 08:18.990
Do we?

08:18.990 --> 08:19.990
Yeah.

08:19.991 --> 08:21.539
Do we need to flip it?

08:21.540 --> 08:22.989
I don't know.

08:22.990 --> 08:28.119
If one of those three win, you
or I are going up next to James,

08:28.120 --> 08:30.989
and we might go home.

08:30.990 --> 08:33.989
This seems so obvious right now.

08:33.990 --> 08:34.990
This is why I love this game.

08:34.991 --> 08:36.989
And it's awful and it's
fantastic.

08:36.990 --> 08:39.409
Oh, my God.

08:39.410 --> 08:41.999
Opposite leg, opposite arm,
15 reps.

08:42.000 --> 08:47.989
So, I don't, pterodactyl is
kind of the best dinosaur

08:47.990 --> 08:51.989
because it can fly.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.989
Steve, what are you doing?

08:53.990 --> 08:57.539
I'm eating fund-it.

08:57.540 --> 09:00.289
There are a lot of pros and cons
with this vote and it's not as

09:00.290 --> 09:01.989
black and white as it seems to
be.

09:01.990 --> 09:06.119
The advantage of getting rid of
Julia is it breaks up aus-twins.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.119
They are a big force in this
game.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.989
Maybe it's time to make a big
move.

09:09.990 --> 09:12.409
I just want you ton I trust you
100%.

09:12.410 --> 09:13.989
I have your back no matter what.

09:13.990 --> 09:14.990
I believe you.

09:14.990 --> 09:15.990
Okay.

09:15.991 --> 09:22.989
We agree that if we ever went
to final five with scamper, it

09:22.990 --> 09:24.989
would be two or three in that
case.

09:24.990 --> 09:24.991
Right.

09:24.991 --> 09:25.990
That's bad.

09:25.991 --> 09:27.989
Yes, that's not ideal.

09:27.990 --> 09:29.989
Austin would never make a
move against those twins.

09:29.990 --> 09:34.119
The thing is, leaving Meg and
James.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.989
Is very risky for our game.

09:35.990 --> 09:37.539
Okay.

09:37.540 --> 09:40.989
James wins an h.O.H. We're
the easiest two to put up first.

09:40.990 --> 09:43.989
There's another piece of this
puzzle.

09:43.990 --> 09:44.990
Incentives.

09:44.990 --> 09:44.991
Hm.

09:44.991 --> 09:51.989
You believe if we take out
Julia, and leave Meg in, then

09:51.990 --> 09:52.990
James wouldn't necessarily
target you.

09:52.991 --> 09:54.289
Or you.

09:54.290 --> 09:56.949
You believe he really would?

09:56.950 --> 09:58.989
Yes.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.989
The twins need to be split up.

10:01.990 --> 10:04.989
Scamper in the final five
doesn't put us in the final two.

10:04.990 --> 10:12.990
Ent a final five that does take
us to final two.

10:25.990 --> 10:27.989
I don't know.

10:27.990 --> 10:30.989
This is a huge game-changing
decision.

10:30.990 --> 10:31.990
And the more I think.

10:31.991 --> 10:35.989
It, I more I just realized I'm
in so over my head.

10:35.990 --> 10:39.989
I hear my mom at home yelling at
me, split up aus-twins.

10:39.990 --> 10:41.539
Vote out Julia.

10:41.540 --> 10:45.409
I am physically sick right now
because I have absolutely no

10:45.410 --> 10:51.990
idea.

10:53.990 --> 10:55.989
Julie: Let's head to the
living room and surprise the

10:55.990 --> 11:00.989
houseguests with the news of
tonight's double eviction.

11:00.990 --> 11:01.990
Hello, houseguests.

11:01.991 --> 11:03.829
Hi, Julie!

11:03.830 --> 11:04.989
Julie: How is everyone
doing tonight?

11:04.990 --> 11:05.990
Good!

11:05.991 --> 11:07.699
How are you?

11:07.700 --> 11:09.989
Julie: Well, don't get too
comfortable everyone, because in

11:09.990 --> 11:13.989
the next hour, two of you will
be evicted.

11:13.990 --> 11:13.991
That's right.

11:13.991 --> 11:20.989
It's time for another double
eviction.

11:20.990 --> 11:24.989
That means, you're going to
experience a whole week's worth

11:24.990 --> 11:30.989
of "Big Brother" in the next 60
minutes.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.989
And there is absolutely no time
to waste.

11:32.990 --> 11:39.989
So, Meg, Julia, in just a few
moments, Liz, Austin, James,

11:39.990 --> 11:42.119
Steve, and Johnny Mac will cast
their votes to evict live.

11:42.120 --> 11:45.999
But before they do, you each
have one last chance to sway

11:46.000 --> 11:50.119
their vote with one brief
statement.

11:50.120 --> 11:50.990
Meg, you're up.

11:50.991 --> 11:54.989
First off, Happy Birthday
daddy-o.

11:54.990 --> 11:56.989
Miss you mom, Mike, and Matt.

11:56.990 --> 12:00.989
Houseguests I know I have been
honored this week being called

12:00.990 --> 12:04.409
someone's queen but the fact is
I've lost a lot of friends

12:04.410 --> 12:06.989
throughout this journey and I
play this game as an

12:06.990 --> 12:07.990
independent, an individual.

12:07.991 --> 12:11.409
I hope you all do the same as
you're voting today.

12:11.410 --> 12:13.999
Also, as your activities
coordinator of the house, if you

12:14.000 --> 12:18.989
would like some b.B. Bullying,
vote for me.

12:18.990 --> 12:20.989
Julie: Thank you, Meg.

12:20.990 --> 12:25.949
First of all, I have to send
love to my family, mom, dad,

12:25.950 --> 12:25.990
Angela, nana.

12:25.991 --> 12:28.989
I love you guys so much and I
miss you more than word can

12:28.990 --> 12:29.120
describe.

12:29.121 --> 12:32.989
And, of course, my better half,
as zingbot mentioned, Liz.

12:32.990 --> 12:37.989
78 days another I walking into
this house pretending to be

12:37.990 --> 12:40.989
another person and that was, by
far, one of the most challenging

12:40.990 --> 12:42.989
aspects of this game for me.

12:42.990 --> 12:46.989
The minute I entered that door
as Julia, I'm so happy that I

12:46.990 --> 12:49.989
got the opportunity to know each
and every one of youa, you know,

12:49.990 --> 12:50.990
the real me.

12:50.991 --> 12:55.989
I have so much more fight left
in me and I've got to prove

12:55.990 --> 12:56.990
zingbot wrong.

12:56.991 --> 12:59.989
So houseguests, I would truly
appreciate your vote tonight.

12:59.990 --> 13:00.990
Thank you.

13:00.991 --> 13:05.989
Julie: Thank you, ladies
it's time for the live voting to

13:05.990 --> 13:06.990
begin.

13:06.991 --> 13:08.989
Vanessa, as the head of
household you are not allowed to

13:08.989 --> 13:09.989
Neither are the two nominees.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.409
One at a time the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

13:13.410 --> 13:14.989
cast your vote to evict.

13:14.990 --> 13:16.829
Liz, you're up first tonight.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.409
Please go to the diary room.

13:19.410 --> 13:20.949
Double eviction!

13:20.950 --> 13:23.949
I knew it!

13:23.950 --> 13:27.989
Julie: Liz has assured her
twin sister Julia that she is

13:27.990 --> 13:28.990
safe.

13:28.990 --> 13:29.990
Her vote should reflect that.

13:29.990 --> 13:30.990
Hi, Liz.

13:30.991 --> 13:32.409
Hi, Julie.

13:32.410 --> 13:35.949
Julie: I know the answer
but I have to ask it anyway.

13:35.950 --> 13:35.990
Please cast your vote to evict.

13:35.991 --> 13:38.989
I, obviously, vote to evict Meg.

13:38.990 --> 13:40.989
Julie: Thank you.

13:40.990 --> 13:41.990
Thank you.

13:41.991 --> 13:43.989
Julie: James and Meg have
been friends since the beginning

13:43.990 --> 13:44.990
of the game.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.989
He has fought hard to keep her
in the house.

13:47.990 --> 13:48.990
Hi, James.

13:48.990 --> 13:49.990
Hey, Julie.

13:49.991 --> 13:51.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.989
I vote to evict Julia.

13:54.990 --> 13:54.991
Julie: Thank you.

13:54.991 --> 13:56.989
Thank you.

13:56.990 --> 14:00.989
Julie: Steve has been
tormented with this potentially

14:00.990 --> 14:01.990
game-changing decision.

14:01.991 --> 14:04.409
What did he decide to do?

14:04.410 --> 14:04.990
Hi, Steve.

14:04.991 --> 14:06.989
Hi, Julie.

14:06.990 --> 14:07.999
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.989
I vote to evict Meg.

14:11.990 --> 14:12.990
Julie: Thank you.

14:12.991 --> 14:14.989
Thanks, Julie.

14:14.990 --> 14:17.989
Julie: Johnny Mac got a
second life in the game and

14:17.990 --> 14:19.989
aligned himself with Vanessa.

14:19.990 --> 14:24.989
Will he stay true to her by
voting to evict Meg?

14:24.990 --> 14:25.000
Hi, John.

14:25.001 --> 14:27.989
Hi, lady!

14:27.990 --> 14:28.990
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

14:28.991 --> 14:31.989
I vote to evict Meg.

14:31.990 --> 14:31.991
Sorry.

14:31.991 --> 14:35.539
Julie: Thank you.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.989
It's official, with athletes
vote to evict Meg, Meg will be

14:37.990 --> 14:41.989
leaving the "Big Brother" house
tonight, but let's see how the

14:41.990 --> 14:43.989
other vote falls.

14:43.990 --> 14:43.991
Hi, Austin.

14:43.991 --> 14:47.989
Hello, Julie.

14:47.990 --> 14:49.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.539
Sorry, grand Marx I vote to
evict Meg.

14:53.540 --> 15:01.540
Julie: Thank you.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.539
All of the votes are in.

15:05.540 --> 15:09.989
Let's give the news to the
houseguests.

15:09.990 --> 15:10.950
Houseguests, the votes are in.

15:10.951 --> 15:14.289
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

15:14.290 --> 15:17.989
just a few moments to say
good-bye, gather her belongings,

15:17.990 --> 15:20.989
and walk out front door.

15:20.990 --> 15:26.989
By a vote of 4-1, Meg, you are
evicted from the "Big Brother"

15:26.990 --> 15:31.989
house.

15:31.990 --> 15:32.990
Good-bye.

15:32.990 --> 15:33.990
Bye, guys.

15:33.991 --> 15:35.949
See you.

15:35.950 --> 15:38.989
Bye, bye, bye.

15:38.990 --> 15:40.989
See you later.

15:40.990 --> 15:47.829
I better not see you later
tonight.

15:47.830 --> 15:51.989
( Applause ) >> Don't fall!

15:51.990 --> 15:59.990
( Cheers and applause )
>> Julie: Hi, Meg.

16:01.990 --> 16:09.989
Welcome.

16:09.990 --> 16:17.990
It hasn't set in yet.

16:18.290 --> 16:18.990
Meg down.

16:18.991 --> 16:26.991
Meg down.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.989
All right.

16:28.990 --> 16:31.989
Julie: All right, Meg,
after being nominated, you said

16:31.990 --> 16:35.989
over and over again that you
felt played.

16:35.990 --> 16:36.990
By who?

16:36.991 --> 16:40.989
Um, well, Vanessa's one of my
favorite girls.

16:40.990 --> 16:42.119
You know that.

16:42.120 --> 16:47.989
I felt like there was this whole
plan to get James out of the

16:47.990 --> 16:50.989
house, and, you know, I am
honestly so happy that he's in

16:50.990 --> 16:54.699
the house, but I feel like I was
a whoops this week.

16:54.700 --> 16:55.989
And here I am.

16:55.990 --> 17:00.989
Julie: Four weeks ago, you
fought very hard to keep

17:00.990 --> 17:03.989
Vanessa, and you and your crew
decide let's dump Shelli.

17:03.990 --> 17:04.990
Do you regret that now?

17:04.991 --> 17:07.119
I don't regret it.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.989
I think, honestly, if Shelli was
still in the house, James and I

17:10.990 --> 17:13.989
would have been in the same
position.

17:13.990 --> 17:15.989
So, no, I don't regret it.

17:15.990 --> 17:18.999
But ironic, that she kicked me
out.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.989
Julie: You told Vanessa
she was not your target.

17:21.990 --> 17:22.990
Was that the truth?

17:22.991 --> 17:25.989
Because at times it looked like
you were conspiring with her.

17:25.990 --> 17:29.989
What...
>> I never know how to take

17:29.990 --> 17:29.991
Vanessa.

17:29.991 --> 17:33.409
She scares me a lot, so, of
course, I'm going to tell her

17:33.410 --> 17:35.989
that "you're not my target."

17:35.990 --> 17:39.119
But always, I would have rather
her be out of the house because

17:39.120 --> 17:42.989
she's just one of those people
that always listens to every

17:42.990 --> 17:44.989
single word you say.

17:44.990 --> 17:47.989
Julie: It looked like you
were grabbing James' face to

17:47.990 --> 17:48.830
kiss him.

17:48.831 --> 17:49.989
No!

17:49.990 --> 17:50.290
Julie: Good-bye.

17:50.291 --> 17:51.989
No, no, no.

17:51.990 --> 17:54.989
He's made it no secret, he has a
crush on you.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.290
Yes.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.989
Julie: Any chance there's
a relationship?

17:56.990 --> 17:59.989
Don't give him any ideas, Julie.

17:59.990 --> 18:00.990
Julie: That's a no?

18:00.990 --> 18:01.990
Just asking for him.

18:01.991 --> 18:03.989
No, we are best friends.

18:03.990 --> 18:07.989
He's an amazing guy, but I don't
think there's any fireworks

18:07.990 --> 18:07.991
there.

18:07.991 --> 18:08.990
Julie: Okay.

18:08.991 --> 18:10.949
( Laughter )
Before we send you off to the

18:10.950 --> 18:12.989
jury house, any final thought.

18:12.990 --> 18:15.989
I am just so thankful for
this opportunity.

18:15.990 --> 18:19.989
It is a blast, and it's so
crazy, and a lot harder than

18:19.990 --> 18:21.989
anyone expects than you expect.

18:21.990 --> 18:23.989
Julie: Expect the
unexpected.

18:23.990 --> 18:25.989
Oh, they're all freaking out
in there right now.

18:25.990 --> 18:27.989
Julie: I know we saw.

18:27.990 --> 18:27.991
Wow.

18:27.991 --> 18:31.409
Julie: We will see you
back here in less than three

18:31.410 --> 18:33.989
weeks when you and the rest of
the jury decides who wins this

18:33.990 --> 18:33.991
thing.

18:33.991 --> 18:35.539
I can't wait.

18:35.540 --> 18:35.990
Julie: Thank you, Meg.

18:35.990 --> 18:36.990
Thank you, so much.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.829
Julie: Up next, it's the
live head of household

18:39.830 --> 18:42.409
competition but it's double
eviction night when means anyone

18:42.410 --> 18:45.699
can rise to power or lose it all
in the blink of an eye.

18:45.700 --> 18:46.989
Stay with us.

18:46.990 --> 18:48.831
( Cheers and applause )
( Cheers and applause )

18:59.990 --> 19:07.990
Cant get enough Big Brother

19:18.990 --> 19:20.949
Julie: Welcome back to
"Big Brother."

19:20.950 --> 19:23.989
It's time to crown a new head of
household.

19:23.990 --> 19:27.539
Free from the threat of
eviction, this h.O.H. Must

19:27.540 --> 19:30.989
immediately put two houseguests
on the chopping block.

19:30.990 --> 19:34.989
And one of those nominees may
leave the "Big Brother" house

19:34.990 --> 19:35.830
tonight.

19:35.831 --> 19:39.119
Let's head to the backyard and
get things started.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.989
Houseguests, the power is up for
grabs.

19:41.990 --> 19:45.989
Vanessa, as outgoing head of
household, you are not eligible

19:45.990 --> 19:46.999
to compete.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.989
This competition is called "b. B.

19:49.990 --> 19:50.700
Road trip."

19:50.701 --> 19:52.409
And here's how it works.

19:52.410 --> 19:55.989
The first six evicted
houseguests may have faded from

19:55.990 --> 19:59.999
the memory wall, but they are
making memories of their own as

20:00.000 --> 20:04.989
they tour the country on a b.B.

20:04.990 --> 20:05.990
Road trip.

20:05.991 --> 20:10.829
For this competition, you will
view pairs of photos from their

20:10.830 --> 20:10.990
journey.

20:10.991 --> 20:15.989
After each pair of photos, I
will ask you a series of

20:15.990 --> 20:20.989
true-or-false questions about
what you just saw in these

20:20.990 --> 20:20.991
photos.

20:20.991 --> 20:23.989
Get the answer correct, you stay
in the game.

20:23.990 --> 20:27.119
Get the answer wrong, and you
will be eliminated.

20:27.120 --> 20:34.119
The last houseguest standing
will be the new head of

20:34.120 --> 20:34.990
household.

20:34.991 --> 20:39.289
Everyone understand? Understand?

20:39.290 --> 20:39.990
Yes.

20:39.991 --> 20:47.991

Nominations will take place

24:05.990 --> 24:10.989
shortly, so everyone please head
inside the house.

24:10.990 --> 24:13.539
Liz, you have just a few minutes
to figure out what you're going

24:13.540 --> 24:13.990
to do.

24:13.991 --> 24:18.989
And I will call all of you back
into the living room in just a

24:18.990 --> 24:25.989
few minutes for nominations.

24:25.990 --> 24:29.989
Up next, Liz must nominate two
houseguests for eviction, but

24:29.990 --> 24:33.989
the live veto competition is
looming, which means anything

24:33.990 --> 24:35.289
can happen.

24:35.290 --> 24:37.989
Stay with us.

24:37.990 --> 24:39.910
( Cheers and applause )
I'm so nervous right now.

25:05.990 --> 25:07.989
Julie: Welcome back to
"Big Brother."

25:07.990 --> 25:10.999
Just moments ago, Liz became the
new head of household.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.989
It is now her responsibility to
put two houseguests up for

25:15.990 --> 25:16.120
eviction.

25:16.121 --> 25:21.989
Let's head to the living room
for the live nomination

25:21.990 --> 25:23.989
ceremony.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.999
Houseguests, please gather in
the living room right now.

25:26.000 --> 25:34.000
It's time for the live
nomination ceremony to begin.

25:40.990 --> 25:42.989
Yup, standing is good.

25:42.990 --> 25:42.991
Liz.

25:42.991 --> 25:45.989
I see all seven you are there.

25:45.990 --> 25:50.989
As head of household, Liz, it is
now time to face your housemates

25:50.990 --> 25:53.999
and make your two nominations.

25:54.000 --> 25:57.989
This is really shocking and
last minute, but we have come

25:57.990 --> 25:59.989
this far in the game, and I
have, you know, go with the

25:59.990 --> 26:03.989
people that I've been loyal to
this whole time, so, I'm sorry,

26:03.990 --> 26:08.119
James, and John, please take a
seat.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.989
Julie: James and John,
thank you for taking your places

26:10.990 --> 26:12.989
in the nomination chairs.

26:12.990 --> 26:16.989
Gentlemen, one of you may be the
next houseguest to be evicted,

26:16.990 --> 26:20.949
but you still have one last
chance to save yourself because

26:20.950 --> 26:24.989
the live veto competition is
next.

26:24.990 --> 26:28.989
Up next, James and John still
have a chance to get off the

26:28.990 --> 26:28.991
block.

26:28.991 --> 26:31.989
The power of veto is up for
grabs when we return.

26:31.990 --> 26:32.990
Stay with us.

26:48.990 --> 26:49.990
Be a fly on the wall

26:49.991 --> 26:57.991
( cheers and applause )

27:09.990 --> 27:11.699
Double eviction night.

27:11.700 --> 27:14.989
Already tonight, Meg was evicted
from the "Big Brother" house.

27:14.990 --> 27:16.989
Then Liz became the new head of
household.

27:16.990 --> 27:19.989
She then put James and John up
for eviction.

27:19.990 --> 27:24.989
Now, after a veto pick, which
took place during the commercial

27:24.990 --> 27:28.989
break, everyone but Vanessa will
face off in this crucial power

27:28.990 --> 27:29.990
of veto competition.

27:29.991 --> 27:33.989
Will James or John win the
p.O.V. And save themselves?

27:33.990 --> 27:37.989
It's time to find out.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.989
Houseguests, it's now time for
the veto competition.

27:39.990 --> 27:44.989
The winner of the power of veto
can use it to remove one of the

27:44.990 --> 27:48.989
nominees from the chopping block
or they can leave Liz's

27:48.990 --> 27:49.990
nominations intact.

27:49.991 --> 27:54.999
This competition is called
"boomerang" and here's how it

27:55.000 --> 27:55.990
works.

27:55.991 --> 28:00.989
Each of you will take two shots
by rolling a ball around the

28:00.990 --> 28:04.989
boomerang into one of the
numbered slots on the other end.

28:04.990 --> 28:09.989
Your score will be the sum of
those two rolls.

28:09.990 --> 28:13.699
Once your ball leaves your hand
and crosses the white line, the

28:13.700 --> 28:14.989
shot is official.

28:14.990 --> 28:21.289
The houseguest with the highest
cumulative score will the power

28:21.290 --> 28:21.990
of veto.

28:21.990 --> 28:22.990
Does everyone understand.

28:22.991 --> 28:24.539
Yes!

28:24.540 --> 28:24.990
Julie: Excellent.

28:24.991 --> 28:29.829
The order was chosen by random
draw, and, Steve, you're up

28:29.830 --> 28:29.990
first.

28:29.991 --> 28:37.991
Please take your first shot.

28:38.700 --> 28:46.700
That first shot is worth zero.

28:50.410 --> 28:55.989
Sorry, Steve, you have a score
of zero.

28:55.990 --> 29:03.990
All right, John, you're up next.

29:07.990 --> 29:15.990
Also zero for your first shot.

29:16.410 --> 29:24.410
Sorry, John.

29:29.990 --> 29:37.990
Austin, your first shot worth
six points.

29:38.700 --> 29:39.989
Your second shot nine.

29:39.990 --> 29:42.119
You have a total combined score
of 15.

29:42.120 --> 29:44.989
You're in the winner's circle
right now.

29:44.990 --> 29:52.990
Liz... I need Vanessa to clear
the balls, please.

29:53.990 --> 29:56.989
And your first shot is a 15,
Liz.

29:56.990 --> 30:03.699
Go ahead and take your second
shot.

30:03.700 --> 30:03.990
It's a zero.

30:03.991 --> 30:05.989
We have a tie.

30:05.990 --> 30:11.989
Julia, do not take a shot until
Vanessa has cleared the balls.

30:11.990 --> 30:15.409
The ball vbz cleared.

30:15.410 --> 30:23.410
Julia, please step up and take
your first shot.

30:26.700 --> 30:34.700
13 points for your first shot.

30:37.950 --> 30:40.989
And four for your second, so you
have 17.

30:40.990 --> 30:43.989
You're in the lead.

30:43.990 --> 30:46.989
Go ahead into the winner's
circle.

30:46.990 --> 30:47.990
17 is the the score to beat.

30:47.991 --> 30:50.989
Thank you for clearing the
balls, Vanessa.

30:50.990 --> 30:51.990
James, you're last.

30:51.991 --> 30:59.991
Go ahead and tak take your first
shot.

31:07.990 --> 31:08.990
Zero.

31:08.991 --> 31:11.999
Sorry, James, but a big
congratulations goes to Julia.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.989
You have won the power of veto.

31:14.990 --> 31:20.539
Please grab that veto medallion
and immediately head inside.

31:20.540 --> 31:23.989
You have just a few minutes to
decide if you're going to use

31:23.990 --> 31:25.990
it, Julia.

31:38.990 --> 31:40.989
Will the nominations change?

31:40.990 --> 31:45.409
And who will be the second
houseguest sent to the jury

31:45.410 --> 31:45.990
tonight?

31:45.990 --> 31:46.990
We'll find out live next.

31:46.991 --> 31:48.989
Stay with us.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.910
( Cheers and applause )
>> Julie: Welcome back to

32:27.120 --> 32:29.989
"bi"Big Brother" "Big Brother."

32:29.990 --> 32:33.699
Julia has just won the power of
veto, but will she use it to

32:33.700 --> 32:35.989
save one of the nominees?

32:35.990 --> 32:38.829
Let's return to the living room
and find out.

32:38.830 --> 32:40.989
Houseguests, it's time to begin
the veto meeting.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.989
I see you're all there in the
living room.

32:42.990 --> 32:47.989
So, Julia, as winner of the
power of veto, you may remove

32:47.990 --> 32:51.989
one of the two nominees from the
chopping block or you may leave

32:51.990 --> 32:53.999
the nominations in place.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.989
James and John, you now have a
chance to plead your case to

32:58.990 --> 32:59.990
Julia.

32:59.991 --> 33:01.989
James, you're first.

33:01.990 --> 33:06.989
Oh, well, I just want to say,
you know, if anything goes

33:06.990 --> 33:12.989
wrong, I'm sent home today, I
appreciate your friendship and

33:12.990 --> 33:13.540
the love of the game.

33:13.541 --> 33:16.989
At the beginning of the game,
you know, I came in and it was

33:16.990 --> 33:21.989
like you were houseguests, but I
all consider y'all now my

33:21.990 --> 33:21.991
friends.

33:21.991 --> 33:24.989
So at the end of the day, I've
tried not to make this a

33:24.990 --> 33:25.700
personal game.

33:25.701 --> 33:26.989
I think I've been really good
with that.

33:26.990 --> 33:30.989
And I would love for y'all to
use the veto on me, but if not,

33:30.990 --> 33:32.409
I totally understand.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.989
Thank you.

33:34.990 --> 33:36.539
Julie: Thank you, James.

33:36.540 --> 33:37.989
John, it's your turn.

33:37.990 --> 33:40.989
Um, it would be really
awesome if you would use the the

33:40.990 --> 33:42.949
veto on me, and that's it.

33:42.950 --> 33:44.999
Use it.

33:45.000 --> 33:45.990
Julie: Thank you, John.

33:45.990 --> 33:46.990
Thank you, both.

33:46.991 --> 33:52.289
All right, Julia, please stand
and give us your decision.

33:52.290 --> 33:54.989
Well, I love you guys both so
much.

33:54.990 --> 33:56.539
You're amazing people.

33:56.540 --> 33:59.989
But I'm going to honor my
sister's nominations.

33:59.990 --> 34:04.119
I don't want to get any more
blood on my hands, so I am not

34:04.120 --> 34:06.119
going to use the power of veto.

34:06.120 --> 34:09.989
Julie: All right, since
the veto was not used, the

34:09.990 --> 34:11.989
nominations will, obviously,
remain in place.

34:11.990 --> 34:16.989
I'll be back for the second live
vote and eviction in just a few

34:16.990 --> 34:17.990
minutes.

34:17.991 --> 34:19.989
Up next, James or John?

34:19.990 --> 34:22.989
Who will be the second
houseguest to leave the "big

34:22.990 --> 34:23.990
brother" house tonight?

34:23.991 --> 34:26.989
The live vote and eviction next.

34:26.990 --> 34:27.990
Stay with us.

34:49.990 --> 34:50.990
( Cheers and applause )
>> Julie: Welcome back to

34:50.990 --> 34:50.991
"Big Brother."

34:50.991 --> 34:54.989
Earlier this evening, Meg was
evicted and sent to the jury.

34:54.990 --> 35:00.829
Now, either James or John will
follow in her footsteps.

35:00.830 --> 35:03.989
Let's return to the living room
for the live vote and eviction.

35:03.990 --> 35:05.989
Hello again, houseguests.

35:05.990 --> 35:09.989
James, John, in just a few
moments your housemates will

35:09.990 --> 35:13.989
cast their votes to evict live,
but before they do, you each

35:13.990 --> 35:17.829
have a final chance to sway
their votes with one brief

35:17.830 --> 35:18.989
statement.

35:18.990 --> 35:21.989
James, you're up first.

35:21.990 --> 35:23.989
All right, guys.

35:23.990 --> 35:25.989
Keep me.

35:25.990 --> 35:27.989
Like I said, I play the game.

35:27.990 --> 35:30.989
I don't hold personal grudges.

35:30.990 --> 35:31.990
I came here for one reason.

35:31.991 --> 35:34.989
It's for my daughter.

35:34.990 --> 35:36.989
Pointblank, if you take me out
of the game, I respect you all,

35:36.990 --> 35:40.989
and I hope we can be friends
afterwardses.

35:40.990 --> 35:41.990
That's it.

35:41.990 --> 35:42.990
Julie: Thank you, James.

35:42.990 --> 35:43.990
John.

35:43.991 --> 35:47.989
I don't have anything funny,
but it would be really cool to

35:47.990 --> 35:50.989
stay, and, please, vote for me
to stay.

35:50.990 --> 35:52.989
The end.

35:52.990 --> 35:53.290
Julie: Thank you, John.

35:53.290 --> 35:54.290
Thank you, both.

35:54.291 --> 35:55.989
All right, everyone.

35:55.990 --> 35:58.989
It is time for the live vote to
begin.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.989
Neither nominee is allowed to
vote.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.989
Liz, as current head of
household, you will only be vote

36:04.990 --> 36:07.699
in the event of a tie.

36:07.700 --> 36:11.999
One at a time, the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

36:12.000 --> 36:14.989
cast your vote to evict.

36:14.990 --> 36:16.989
Austin, you're up first.

36:16.990 --> 36:19.989
Please go to the diary room.

36:19.990 --> 36:22.539
Austin has enjoyed having James
in the house.

36:22.540 --> 36:27.989
Will that be enough to keep him?

36:27.990 --> 36:27.991
Hi, Austin.

36:27.991 --> 36:29.989
Hi, Julie.

36:29.990 --> 36:30.990
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

36:30.991 --> 36:33.989
I've grown to love him, but,
Jace, this is for you.

36:33.990 --> 36:35.989
I vote to evict James.

36:35.990 --> 36:37.989
Julie: Thank you.

36:37.990 --> 36:43.989
Who does Julia single best to
vote out to keep her sister

36:43.990 --> 36:44.410
safe?

36:44.410 --> 36:45.000
Hi, Julia.

36:45.001 --> 36:47.989
Hi, Julie.

36:47.990 --> 36:48.990
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

36:48.991 --> 36:51.989
I vote to evict James.

36:51.990 --> 36:54.289
Julie: Thank you.

36:54.290 --> 36:56.989
Vanessa tried to get James out
last week.

36:56.990 --> 37:00.989
Will she vote him out tonight?

37:00.990 --> 37:01.990
Hi, Vanessa.

37:01.991 --> 37:03.989
Hey, Julie.

37:03.990 --> 37:04.990
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

37:04.991 --> 37:07.989
I vote to evict James.

37:07.990 --> 37:10.409
Julie: Thank you.

37:10.410 --> 37:10.990
It's official.

37:10.991 --> 37:15.989
With three votes to evict James,
James will be leaving the

37:15.990 --> 37:16.990
brother house tonight.

37:16.991 --> 37:18.989
But let's see how Steve votes.

37:18.990 --> 37:18.991
Hi, Steve.

37:18.991 --> 37:20.989
Hi, Julie.

37:20.990 --> 37:21.990
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

37:21.991 --> 37:23.989
I vote to evict James.

37:23.990 --> 37:24.410
Julie: Thank you.

37:24.411 --> 37:32.411
Thank you, Julie.

37:37.540 --> 37:38.989
Julie: All of the votes
are in.

37:38.990 --> 37:42.989
Let's give the news to the
houseguests.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.539
Houseguests, just a reminder.

37:44.540 --> 37:47.989
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

37:47.990 --> 37:52.989
just a few moments to say
good-bye and walk out the front

37:52.990 --> 37:52.991
door.

37:52.991 --> 37:59.949
By a vote of 4-0, James, you are
evicted from the "Big Brother"

37:59.950 --> 38:01.989
house.

38:01.990 --> 38:04.829
All right, guys.

38:04.830 --> 38:05.989
Stay fun, man.

38:05.990 --> 38:06.990
Good luck, guys.

38:06.991 --> 38:11.989
Love you.

38:11.990 --> 38:14.989
All right, buddy.

38:14.990 --> 38:17.989
Bye James.

38:17.990 --> 38:18.990
Have fun in there.

38:18.990 --> 38:19.990
All right.

38:19.990 --> 38:20.990
Hey, thank you, guys.

38:20.991 --> 38:22.989
I mean it.

38:22.990 --> 38:24.989
James, you're a great guy.

38:24.990 --> 38:26.949
Thanks, Vanessa.

38:26.950 --> 38:32.699
( Cheers and applause )
>> Hi, Julie.

38:32.700 --> 38:35.829
Julie: Have a seat.

38:35.830 --> 38:37.289
You know who my target was.

38:37.290 --> 38:38.989
So thank you.

38:38.990 --> 38:41.829
Thank you.

38:41.830 --> 38:44.949
Thanks, guys.

38:44.950 --> 38:47.989
So final six?

38:47.990 --> 38:50.989
I feel like... I'm so
overwhelmed right now.

38:50.990 --> 38:51.540
Oh, my God.

38:51.541 --> 38:59.541
It's been a very busy day.

39:10.830 --> 39:13.949
You got that monkey off your
back.

39:13.950 --> 39:19.989
Now you know how I felt last
time.

39:19.990 --> 39:20.990
Good speech.

39:20.990 --> 39:21.990
Oh, thank you.

39:21.991 --> 39:24.989
Yeah, very put together and
poised.

39:24.990 --> 39:32.989
Really?

39:32.990 --> 39:36.989
Julie: James, as soon as
you lost the power of veto

39:36.990 --> 39:38.989
competition tonight, you did not
campaign.

39:38.990 --> 39:42.989
You didn't try and get votes to
stay.

39:42.990 --> 39:44.989
You kind of through in the
towel.

39:44.990 --> 39:45.990
How come?

39:45.991 --> 39:48.989
I knew I was a huge threat in
this game.

39:48.990 --> 39:51.539
I knew it as soon as they put me
and Meg on the block together

39:51.540 --> 39:53.989
and I knew I was going to be the
next one out regardless of what

39:53.990 --> 39:54.990
would have happened.

39:54.991 --> 39:58.989
There's a strong duoin that
group, as everyone knows.

39:58.990 --> 40:01.989
It's like breaking them three up
the only thing I would have had

40:01.990 --> 40:04.989
to do was win h.O.H. To split
them up.

40:04.990 --> 40:08.999
They have a good strong group in
it there right now.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.989
Julie: The austwens.

40:10.990 --> 40:13.989
But you said they have a strong
duo.

40:13.990 --> 40:14.990
Which two of three?

40:14.990 --> 40:15.990
Honestly, Julie.

40:15.991 --> 40:17.989
I think all of them are working
together.

40:17.990 --> 40:18.990
I don't even know.

40:18.991 --> 40:21.989
I was out of the loop the last
week when me and Meg were on the

40:21.990 --> 40:22.830
block.

40:22.831 --> 40:25.699
I spent a lot of time with Meg
trying to support her and I just

40:25.700 --> 40:29.949
felt like the whole house just
kind of ganged up together, and

40:29.950 --> 40:31.989
found out Steve was working with
them at the last minute.

40:31.990 --> 40:34.989
So really nothing I could really
do at this time.

40:34.990 --> 40:39.989
Julie: You made big, bold
moves when you were h.O.H.

40:39.990 --> 40:42.989
After telling Shelli you and
Clay are safe, you nominated

40:42.990 --> 40:43.410
Clay and Shelli.

40:43.411 --> 40:46.989
But then when you weren't in
power, you kind of kicked back.

40:46.990 --> 40:49.989
We didn't really see you playing
the game too much, and you

40:49.990 --> 40:52.989
watched your friends one by one
by one get picked off.

40:52.990 --> 40:54.989
Why didn't you play more
aggressively?

40:54.990 --> 40:57.989
I noticed a lot of the
aggressive players were the ones

40:57.990 --> 40:58.990
getting taken out of the game.

40:58.991 --> 41:02.989
You know, they were the ones
going around stirring drama,

41:02.990 --> 41:06.119
telling secret to everyone, and,
you know, I learned in the

41:06.120 --> 41:07.989
military out of sight, out of
mind.

41:07.990 --> 41:12.829
So it's ceend... I kind of used
that concept with that.

41:12.830 --> 41:13.989
And, you know, I'll take seven.

41:13.990 --> 41:14.990
That's not too bad.

41:14.991 --> 41:16.989
It was a tough game to play in
there.

41:16.990 --> 41:18.989
I gotta say that.

41:18.990 --> 41:19.990
It's very tough in there.

41:19.991 --> 41:21.989
Julie: Let's talk about
Meg.

41:21.990 --> 41:24.989
Is this something outside of the
house you think you can take out

41:24.990 --> 41:26.989
of the friendship zone with her?

41:26.990 --> 41:27.990
Oh, man.

41:27.991 --> 41:32.989
You know, I've been trying with
Meg for 75 long days.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.829
( Laughter )
And I think if I haven't got it

41:34.830 --> 41:39.989
this far yet, then I might as
well throw in the towel.

41:39.990 --> 41:41.989
Julie: Realistic of you.

41:41.990 --> 41:41.991
Well said.

41:41.991 --> 41:43.289
Thank you, Julie.

41:43.290 --> 41:45.989
Julie: You're off to the
jury house, but we will see you

41:45.990 --> 41:48.989
back here in less than three
weeks when you and the others

41:48.990 --> 41:49.990
decide who wins "Big Brother."

41:49.991 --> 41:51.289
Sounds good.

41:51.290 --> 41:51.990
Julie: Thank you, James.

41:51.991 --> 41:53.409
Thank you, Julie.

41:53.410 --> 41:56.949
Julie: 20 days remain in
the battle for a half million

41:56.950 --> 41:56.990
dollars.

41:56.991 --> 41:59.989
Tune in Sunday to find out who
will be the new head of

41:59.990 --> 42:03.829
household, and whom he or she
will nominate for eviction.

42:03.830 --> 42:06.989
Then on Wednesday, the power of
veto is back up for grabs.

42:06.990 --> 42:09.989
And on Thursday, the live
eviction costs another

42:09.990 --> 42:13.989
houseguest their shot at winning
it all.

42:13.990 --> 42:18.989
Tune in to "Big Brother after
dark" on poptv, tonight,

42:18.990 --> 42:21.989
starting at 1:00 A.M. eastern
and pacific to see who takes

42:21.990 --> 42:22.950
control of the house.

42:22.951 --> 42:25.989
To find your channel go to
popped TV.Com.

42:25.990 --> 42:29.989
For now, let's eavesdrop on the
houseguests.

42:29.990 --> 42:34.989
From outside the "Big Brother"
hohouse with James, I'm Julie

42:34.990 --> 42:34.991
chen.

42:34.991 --> 42:37.949
Good night.

42:37.950 --> 42:44.989
( Cheers and applause )
>> Does everyone where his stuff

42:44.990 --> 42:44.991
is?

42:44.991 --> 42:47.989
We'll be able to figure it out.

42:47.990 --> 42:48.990
It's in the other room.

42:48.991 --> 42:51.989
It is going to be boy stuff
that is not Austin's or mine.

42:51.990 --> 42:54.989
But it's also literally in
the...

42:54.990 --> 42:55.990
he did put it together.

42:55.991 --> 42:58.829
It's all together, yeah.

42:58.830 --> 43:04.119
Oh, nigh God.

43:04.120 --> 43:05.289
Is that a win?

43:05.290 --> 43:06.290
Yeah.

43:06.290 --> 43:06.990
Oh, thank you.

43:06.990 --> 43:07.990
I know.

43:07.991 --> 43:13.289
I'm so happy I woning it.

43:13.290 --> 43:16.989
It's funny, you were probably
the best at that boomerang veto

43:16.990 --> 43:19.119
and it was just way harder than
it...

43:19.120 --> 43:21.989
yeah, I threw it way too hard.

43:21.990 --> 43:22.990
Yeah.
