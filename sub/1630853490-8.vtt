WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:11.845
Eyes forward. Face calm.
You deserve to be here.

00:11.929 --> 00:13.805
Or, at least,
you have to convince him you do.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.853
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

00:19.937 --> 00:22.439
What? No. What? No!

00:22.523 --> 00:25.734
Why would you-- No. No, I-I'm here to…

00:25.817 --> 00:28.320
Run away from the husband
trying to lock you in the loony bin.

00:28.403 --> 00:32.573
…accept your generous offer
of the endorsement thing.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.493
The "endorsement thing"?

00:35.827 --> 00:37.913
You've given it a lot of thought, clearly.

00:37.996 --> 00:41.208
Sell it. Believe it.
It's the only way he will.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.127
I have actually, and I realized--

00:44.211 --> 00:47.798
I mean, what an opportunity working with
and learning from you would be.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.175
So, here I am.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.804
Should we make it official?

00:59.518 --> 01:01.436
-Let's tan.
-Excuse me?

01:01.520 --> 01:03.647
My treat. Come on.

01:06.233 --> 01:09.486
Hey, I don't like the way
we left things the other day. I regret it.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.154
Don't say another word.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.991
I mean,
it was an intellectual disagreement,

01:14.074 --> 01:17.494
and luckily we live in a country
where that can still happen.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.454
Water under the bridge.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.415
-Let me pour you a glass.
-Great.

01:21.999 --> 01:26.336
Do you have those 990 series forms
and the EIN tax documents for E.Y.E.?

01:28.797 --> 01:31.925
Yeah, somewhere.
I don't know exactly where.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.760
Would you go get them, please?

01:34.970 --> 01:36.597
Is this some kind of a breakup?

01:36.680 --> 01:40.684
No. No,
it is most definitely not a breakup.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.811
Yeah, obviously
I didn't mean it like that. Jesus.

01:43.395 --> 01:46.732
It's been decided that it would be best
if you and E.Y.E. parted ways.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.275
I need those tax documents.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.027
So, it's a coup?

01:50.110 --> 01:53.155
Come on, Danny.
It's not like you care about any of this.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.325
I don't care? I don't care? I--

01:56.408 --> 01:59.494
Nothing hurts more
than someone saying that I--

01:59.578 --> 02:02.998
All I do is care!
All I do is fucking care!

02:03.081 --> 02:04.208
-About the ocean?
-Yes!

02:04.291 --> 02:05.334
-The environment?
-Yes!

02:05.417 --> 02:06.585
I don't think so.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.755
The less you have to do with the group,
the better-off it's done.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.883
Our donations are up threefold
ever since that good press we got.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.385
You know, some people
just aren't cut out for leadership.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.845
And your son, Leo, is?

02:16.929 --> 02:18.972
Maybe. After a few years at least.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.641
Oh, yeah, maybe, in a few years.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.143
He has the charisma
of a pile of fucking laundry.

02:23.227 --> 02:26.146
Have you heard him talk about
his crush at school, Stephanie K.?

02:26.897 --> 02:28.273
Come on, pal.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.526
He's delusional.
And I'll tell you what, so are you!

02:30.609 --> 02:31.693
Danny!

02:34.863 --> 02:38.534
Why don't you go get the tax forms
so I can get on with my day?

02:40.035 --> 02:41.036
Okay.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.502
So, you still teach
some of your classes, right?

02:49.753 --> 02:52.339
Even though you've expanded,
you still lead a lot of your classes?

02:52.422 --> 02:55.551
More than I should.
So says Marika, at least.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.302
Why does she say that?

02:57.386 --> 03:01.098
Well, to her, classes are
the ground level of the pyramid.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.725
Well, I guess that makes sense.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.602
She's a genius.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.147
Maybe she's gay too.
That's gotta be what this is.

03:09.231 --> 03:12.484
Yeah. Well, the thing about aerobics
that I love is the aerobics.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.779
And I-- You know,
I hardly get to do it anymore.

03:15.863 --> 03:19.366
If she heard you say that,
she would tear you to shreds!

03:19.449 --> 03:21.243
"It's not a hobby. Grow up.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.371
If we don't stop growing, we die.
Stop biting your fingernails."

03:24.955 --> 03:28.125
I bite my fingernails,
and she hates that about me.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.753
So, what is the top of the pyramid?

03:31.837 --> 03:34.131
I mean, really. Is there one?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.217
Is that a philosophical question
or a business one?

03:37.885 --> 03:38.886
Both.

03:38.969 --> 03:42.264
When you get a big,
fat, juicy buyout offer.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.600
I'm talking Nabisco big.

03:44.683 --> 03:47.686
And then you just sell
the whole fucking pyramid

03:47.769 --> 03:49.396
and move to the Bahamas.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.400
But that's a ways away yet.

03:56.153 --> 03:59.031
Are you here to work for me
or to try to become me?

03:59.114 --> 04:01.408
He's onto you. Better play dumb.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.744
I guess I--

04:04.620 --> 04:06.538
I'm not really sure.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.711
I'm gonna miss it here.

04:13.795 --> 04:14.796
Okay.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.466
-You're not?
-No.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.302
I am ready for new.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.137
Mexico's been around, Bun.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.764
I meant new to us.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.850
Just disappearing for a while, laying low.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.186
That sounds pretty fucking cool
to me right now.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.148
I have to say goodbye to her.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.070
My surf spot.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.614
Waves are waves.
They got 'em down there too. Keep packing.

04:43.242 --> 04:46.828
Fine. Fuck! We'll go by there
on our way out of town.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.957
You're the champ, Bun!

04:50.582 --> 04:53.418
You know,
I'm taping a new infomercial today.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.088
Tonight, actually.
Marika thinks it will help capture

04:56.171 --> 04:59.550
the "night time is the right time" energy
of the thing.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.468
What's the thing?

05:01.552 --> 05:04.221
Well, I am the thing, always.

05:04.721 --> 05:08.475
But the concept is a Vegas nightclub
on New Year's Eve.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.519
"Counting Down to a New You."

05:11.645 --> 05:13.480
"New You's Eve."

05:13.564 --> 05:15.524
Exactly!

05:15.607 --> 05:19.361
But Marika wants an
"Ol' Blue Eyes in the Playboy Club" feel,

05:19.444 --> 05:23.115
and I want it to be… something else.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.577
Well, you're the thing, right?
So, just do it your way.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.370
I mean, we do this every time.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.123
We get in a fight before something big.
It's our tradition.

05:31.206 --> 05:35.169
And it's stressful
and it wears on us both.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.378
Yeah. But it's your process,

05:36.461 --> 05:38.463
and you couldn't change it
even if you wanted to.

05:38.547 --> 05:39.548
Exactly.

05:52.311 --> 05:55.981
She's right, and I'm sorry.

05:58.025 --> 06:02.154
I'm so sorry. I don't know you.
I don't know anything about you.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.157
I pretend like I do
'cause I'm so full of shit.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.623
You don't know anything about me.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.878
And… I want that to change.

06:17.961 --> 06:21.465
I want that to change right now.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.260
It's not too late.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.223
I'm tired of being full of shit.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.851
I'm tired of pretending like I care,
like I know you.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.313
Pretending like you know me.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.275
It changes right now. Right now.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.665
Have we been in here too long?

06:54.748 --> 06:57.042
-I'm starting to feel a little--
-Relax.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.545
You think they'd sell these things
if they weren't safe?

06:59.628 --> 07:02.631
Without a base tan,
the sun will burn you to a crisp.

07:03.257 --> 07:06.552
-I just need to be out by noon.
-Why is that?

07:06.635 --> 07:11.098
Because I have an appointment
with somebody who has disappointed us.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.100
And I just can't miss it.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.020
What the fuck is this?

07:17.771 --> 07:21.358
You picked an interesting day
to be my little shadow.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.819
I don't know
about being your little shadow.

07:23.902 --> 07:24.987
I do.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.532
You know I can see you, right?

07:28.615 --> 07:31.243
I have ever since
you stumbled into my class.

07:31.827 --> 07:35.247
You have a real… something.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.333
I might like you. And I don't like anyone.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.461
Well, I might like you too.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.799
When I was about three or four--

07:45.883 --> 07:47.718
I don't know how old. Was I three?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.345
-I was just bodyboarding then, so…
-Can we do this faster?

07:50.429 --> 07:52.097
Nope. I was three.

07:52.181 --> 07:55.225
My cousin was the first one
to tell me I could piss in the ocean.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.436
Right over there.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.106
He was just like,
"Go in the ocean, dude."

08:01.190 --> 08:03.192
I was like, "Cool."

08:03.275 --> 08:05.152
I was about ankle-deep in.

08:05.235 --> 08:08.113
I just pulled down my trunks
and started pissing.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.199
It was glorious.

08:10.282 --> 08:11.491
Sounds like it.

08:11.575 --> 08:14.328
-But then--
-Baby, there is more to this story?

08:14.411 --> 08:16.121
This crotchety old lady,

08:16.205 --> 08:18.832
she grabbed me by the ear
and drags me back to my cousin,

08:18.916 --> 08:21.960
and Joe is like,
"He's three years old. Now fuck off."

08:22.461 --> 08:24.630
She got all offended and stomped off.

08:26.632 --> 08:29.134
People stomped off back then, you know?

08:29.218 --> 08:30.219
Now…

08:34.556 --> 08:35.724
Yep, that dude's drowning.

08:51.907 --> 08:55.661
God. Hated that. But it had to happen.

08:57.704 --> 09:01.583
What did he do that was so bad
that he deserved that?

09:02.209 --> 09:05.420
Well, he did inferior work
on our product-- my product.

09:06.505 --> 09:10.217
And if I let people continue
to do that without consequences,

09:10.300 --> 09:11.718
we're finished.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.514
What happened to you as a child?

09:17.349 --> 09:18.934
Everything, obviously.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.396
Do you wanna see how big my house is?

09:22.896 --> 09:25.816
Careful. You need a meal ticket,
not a new best friend.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.234
I do.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.033
Here we are.

09:36.410 --> 09:39.329
Where are my babies? Where are they?

09:39.413 --> 09:42.583
Where are you? Where are you?
Where are you?

09:42.666 --> 09:46.336
Where are you? Here you are!
Yes, baby! Oh, yes! Kisses.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.631
Yes. Kisses, kisses. Good boy. Kisses.

09:49.715 --> 09:52.176
Why is this?

09:52.759 --> 09:54.595
We've met. Sheila Rubin.

09:54.678 --> 09:58.765
I know. But why is this, Vincent?

09:58.849 --> 10:01.268
Hush. Come here.

10:04.313 --> 10:07.566
We're talking about bringing Sheila
under the Vinnie Green banner.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.570
Yes, we just had a great meeting
at the offices,

10:11.653 --> 10:14.740
and Vinnie thought we should come
back here and continue the conversation.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.701
-I'm in town just for a few more hours--
-Vincent and I will talk.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.746
Sheila had her first tan
today at the office.

10:21.580 --> 10:25.125
I mean, think about that. At her age,
first time in the tanning bed.

10:25.209 --> 10:27.127
Well, in San Diego,

10:27.211 --> 10:29.254
we do tend to just rely on the sun.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.048
Your skin is…

10:32.966 --> 10:34.635
No.

10:34.718 --> 10:38.805
Now, Vincent, we have
a frozen-food company from Cincinnati

10:38.889 --> 10:40.349
coming to the shoot tonight,

10:40.432 --> 10:43.185
and then to have a big talk afterward.

10:46.563 --> 10:50.901
Do you have a Cincinnati, San Diego?

10:51.902 --> 10:53.445
I don't know what you're asking me.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.030
Perhaps you don't belong here?

10:56.657 --> 10:58.158
That doesn't seem like a question.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.202
Marika, you're being too playful.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.120
She wants to help sell our hosiery.

11:02.204 --> 11:04.373
Well, I've seen the tape, and she won't.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.458
Women don't like you.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.587
Your tuxedo came back from the tailors,

11:10.671 --> 11:12.756
and it is perfect.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.011
Can we talk about my wardrobe for tonight?

11:19.930 --> 11:23.851
I'm leaning towards something
a little more casual than the tuxedo.

11:23.934 --> 11:25.227
You know, more me.

11:27.271 --> 11:28.856
Come upstairs.

11:28.939 --> 11:31.024
I want to hear how it went with Diem.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.910
Just a little closer, dude.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.165
-You all right?
-Yeah.

11:50.586 --> 11:53.338
-Okay. Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.802
Oh, no fucking way!

11:58.886 --> 12:01.138
Right? It's this fucking guy.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.056
I don't know what happened.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.186
The current started to take me out.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.562
What are the odds?

12:08.645 --> 12:11.023
He was probably trying to kill himself
to get away from her.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.734
Dude--

12:13.817 --> 12:15.110
Wait, I know you.

12:15.194 --> 12:17.029
You do, dude. I know.

12:17.112 --> 12:19.448
Okay, great.
We've put two and two together.

12:19.531 --> 12:20.908
-Now, Tyler--
-Tyler?

12:20.991 --> 12:22.826
-I'm him, dude.
-And Bunny.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.163
You just saved my fucking life.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.333
Just like Elton said you would.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.919
Oh, yeah, I'm not a huge fan,
but that's cool.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.921
Uh-huh. We're leaving.

12:34.838 --> 12:35.923
Wait! Wait!

12:36.507 --> 12:37.508
Wait.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.636
This is a sign.

12:40.719 --> 12:43.388
Oh, no. It's not.

12:43.472 --> 12:46.183
We were meant to be here
at this exact moment.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.351
Don't say it.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.186
This all happened for a reason.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.729
Hey! Hey.

12:51.313 --> 12:54.149
Isn't there, like, some kind of
medieval code or something?

12:54.233 --> 12:57.486
You gotta come over to my house
for wine and sweetmeats now?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.907
-Sounds pretty chill.
-What is happening?

13:01.990 --> 13:04.034
I make a pretty decent mole.

13:04.910 --> 13:07.871
How did he know I love mole?

13:10.040 --> 13:11.542
You don't have to call him.

13:11.625 --> 13:15.254
You're in rehab, so it's perfectly
acceptable to be out of touch.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.714
You're healing. Growing.

13:17.798 --> 13:22.094
Unless he calls them and finds out
you did a runner and never showed up.

13:22.177 --> 13:25.639
Just call him. Buy yourself some time
to see this Vinnie thing through.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.189
Keep it simple.
Don't get yourself into any more trouble.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.157
You've reached the Rubins.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.244
Please leave us a message after the tone,
and we will call you back.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.745
Peace and love.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.833
Hi, Danny! Hi, Maya.

13:52.916 --> 13:56.378
It's me. It's Sheila. Mama.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.673
I just wanted to call to check in

13:59.756 --> 14:05.512
and let you know that I'm good.
It's been very, very good here.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.223
I'm already feeling much healthier

14:08.307 --> 14:13.270
and learning so much about myself
and the path ahead.

14:13.353 --> 14:17.316
So, thank you
for encouraging me to come here.

14:17.399 --> 14:22.946
I really appreciate it.
And I love you both.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.991
And I should let
someone else use the phone now,

14:26.074 --> 14:29.036
but I'll see you soon. Okay. Bye.

14:31.205 --> 14:34.166
You found the phone, I see. Good.

14:34.249 --> 14:37.294
I hope that's okay.
I was just checking in with my family.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.421
I understand as a father of two.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.217
Come on. I wanna show you my lair.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.536
Can you even move in that thing?

15:10.619 --> 15:12.621
Well, it gives a little more than it did,

15:12.704 --> 15:14.915
but I still feel like
I'm in a straitjacket.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.459
Well, you have to be comfortable
to be confident.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.087
I'm stealing that.

15:20.921 --> 15:23.382
-Go tell her.
-It's still rest period.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.847
And she takes her rest period
somewhere else?

15:29.930 --> 15:31.598
She sleeps upstairs in the master.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.977
I run hot body-temp-wise.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.104
It's the one thing
that we're not in sync on.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.606
But here, it's nice and cool
because of the concrete.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.650
Plus, there's my train set.

15:44.611 --> 15:49.449
I've had it my whole life, and the sound,
it just-- it soothes me.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.871
And this was your decision?
Living in the garage?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.707
Well, of course, it was. It's my house.

15:57.666 --> 16:01.670
I like it this way.
You know, it works for both of us.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.715
Do you really like it?
Or are you just used to it?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.885
We all adapt to our circumstances,
don't we?

16:09.428 --> 16:12.848
Like you and your husband.
You had a good chat before?

16:12.931 --> 16:14.016
Watch it.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.935
You're here to learn his secrets,
not the other way around.

16:17.436 --> 16:21.023
I just left a message. He worries.

16:21.732 --> 16:23.358
Then it's good that you checked in.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.993
You want me to show you
the outfit I like for the shoot?

16:37.623 --> 16:40.501
Sorry I sort of
overpromised on the mole.

16:40.584 --> 16:43.504
I think I meant guacamole.
I don't know how to make mole.

16:43.587 --> 16:44.880
It's all good, dude.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.175
So, Queen Sheila's off at some spa
for the weekend?

16:49.593 --> 16:52.137
Is she paying them,
or are they paying her?

16:52.221 --> 16:54.389
No. We're paying.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.768
But she just, you know,
needed a little break.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.938
You sure I can't get you a glass for that?

17:01.021 --> 17:02.981
Fucking told you I'm good with the bottle.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.525
Babe, please?

17:07.361 --> 17:09.780
So, Mexico?

17:10.906 --> 17:12.366
How'd that idea come together?

17:15.243 --> 17:18.038
Tyler's always wanted to learn
how to make homemade tortillas.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.499
That's true.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.294
So, like, sort of
a small business venture?

17:25.753 --> 17:27.130
I don't know. You know,

17:27.214 --> 17:29.800
just seems like they probably
have a head start on you down there

17:29.883 --> 17:32.636
when it comes to market share
and expertise.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.557
This might be a good time to admit,

17:36.640 --> 17:39.351
we haven't thought the Mexico plan fully,
super through.

17:39.977 --> 17:41.520
So, why are you guys really going?

17:42.104 --> 17:44.022
Why is your wife really out of town?

17:44.106 --> 17:45.399
Okay.

17:46.483 --> 17:47.568
I got it.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.029
Who am I to tell you guys
how to live your lives?

17:51.113 --> 17:53.574
-Nobody.
-Nobody's nobody.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.784
Everybody's somebody.

17:55.868 --> 17:59.872
Yes. That right there is the truth.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.499
Wait, is that the truth?

18:02.583 --> 18:05.544
No, now that I think about it,
I don't think that's the truth at all

18:05.627 --> 18:08.672
because there's a lot of nobodies
out there just walking amongst us,

18:08.755 --> 18:12.259
and a lot of those nobodies
think they are somebodies.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.095
Is this what
a nervous breakdown looks like?

18:15.179 --> 18:17.973
Could I share something with you guys
that I've never shared before?

18:20.017 --> 18:23.645
Marika may seem overbearing
to you, I know.

18:23.729 --> 18:26.982
A lot of people don't understand it,
and I don't blame them.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.776
I understand it completely.

18:31.069 --> 18:34.990
I've had some experience
with a Marika-type in my life.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.159
You know, someone
with a real hold over me.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.536
-What, your husband?
-No.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.958
It's someone else.
Someone I've just gotten very used to.

18:46.543 --> 18:49.296
That I always thought I needed,
but I'm beginning to think…

18:49.379 --> 18:52.132
What are you doing?
This is not helpful or necessary.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.968
…that she's holding me back.

18:55.052 --> 18:57.638
How is sharing this helping you?
Shut your trap.

18:57.721 --> 19:01.600
She just needs me to need her.
She's a parasite.

19:02.851 --> 19:06.146
She tells me she's helping me,
but really, she's draining me.

19:06.230 --> 19:09.107
Wait, your mother?
Your manager? Who is this person?

19:09.191 --> 19:11.401
What are you gonna say?
She's a voice in your head?

19:11.485 --> 19:14.196
He'll think you're crazy,
and he's an adult with a train set.

19:14.279 --> 19:17.491
She's an old friend,
someone who's been with me for a while.

19:18.492 --> 19:21.203
Do you love it? Because I do. I love it.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.330
-It's incredible.
-It is, isn't it?

19:25.249 --> 19:27.626
-Do you want a pep pill?
-Yeah.

19:30.087 --> 19:32.631
I get them from a valet parking attendant
at the Bistro Gardens,

19:32.714 --> 19:34.466
and Marika doesn't know about it.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.135
We have to keep a few little secrets,
don't we?

19:41.181 --> 19:42.933
Being in the studio is always nice,

19:43.016 --> 19:47.145
but here is where the real
creative magic happens.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.567
But there's a little game
that I like to play first.

19:54.027 --> 19:58.073
You have the chance to even the score
right now in the lightning round.

19:58.991 --> 20:00.242
Rapid fire.

20:00.951 --> 20:03.078
Don't think. Just answer.

20:04.121 --> 20:06.874
No skipping. No lying.
Don't fuck with me, or you're out.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.084
-You ready?
-Yes.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.670
Go. Who were you lying to
on the telephone?

20:11.753 --> 20:14.173
-I told you. I wasn't lying--
-Who exactly?

20:15.215 --> 20:16.842
-My husband.
-And?

20:16.925 --> 20:17.926
My child.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.803
Where do your husband
and child think you are?

20:19.887 --> 20:21.597
-Spa.
-Fuck you, Sheila.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.141
-A mental health facility.
-For what?

20:24.224 --> 20:25.475
For bulimia.

20:25.559 --> 20:26.852
Is that the throwing-up one?

20:27.728 --> 20:29.062
-Verbal answers only, please.
-Yes.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.856
-Does it work?
-Yes, until it doesn't.

20:30.939 --> 20:32.774
Your Marika-type, who is it?

20:32.858 --> 20:34.735
-It's me.
-No cheating.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.821
It's me, but it's not me.
It's just a voice inside my head.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.990
-Sounds crazy.
-Yes, it is.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.200
And she controls you?

20:41.283 --> 20:43.076
Well, it feels that way, yes.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.328
And do you hate her?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.830
Intensely, but I am her too.

20:48.874 --> 20:50.667
Who messed with you when you were a kid?

20:51.877 --> 20:53.128
Friend of my father's.

20:56.381 --> 20:57.925
Me too!

20:59.760 --> 21:01.512
Ding, ding!

21:01.595 --> 21:03.430
She did it!

21:03.514 --> 21:05.349
Johnny, tell her what she's won!

21:05.432 --> 21:08.393
She gets a chance to dance with Vinnie.

21:08.477 --> 21:10.270
Ha, fucking, ha!

21:10.354 --> 21:11.939
Green!

21:33.001 --> 21:35.254
Yes!

22:04.032 --> 22:06.577
-Your turn.
-Oh, no. That's not how this works.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.829
Fuck you, Vinnie.

22:11.415 --> 22:13.250
What's the arrangement
with you and Marika?

22:13.333 --> 22:15.502
We share our home and our lives.
Full stop.

22:16.545 --> 22:17.921
Does she know you're gay?

22:18.005 --> 22:20.632
Everyone knows
how blissfully happy I am.

22:21.592 --> 22:22.926
You know what I mean.

22:23.010 --> 22:25.512
Well, we understand
and support each other.

22:25.596 --> 22:28.265
I had a six-month affair
with a Mormon man I despise.

22:28.348 --> 22:31.143
Even though it's over, I just miss it.

22:31.226 --> 22:33.312
I miss being that awful to myself.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.023
-Well, at least you ended it, right?
-No. He did.

22:36.106 --> 22:39.109
I don't stop anything myself.
That's what the voice is for.

22:39.193 --> 22:41.111
Is that what the voice is for?

22:43.280 --> 22:45.324
That's what it wants you to think.

22:47.034 --> 22:49.620
But you can do anything
you set your mind to.

22:50.495 --> 22:51.830
You really believe that?

22:51.914 --> 22:53.040
I make people believe it.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.793
And that's even better
than believing it myself.

22:59.087 --> 23:04.843
So without anyone asking
or even suggesting that I should,

23:04.927 --> 23:09.723
ever since I was 16,
I have been writing my life story.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.099
In my own words.

23:12.059 --> 23:14.353
And I continue to write it,

23:14.436 --> 23:18.649
even as my life has become
less and less notable.

23:18.732 --> 23:20.901
Are you gonna read some of it to us?

23:20.984 --> 23:23.946
Damn right he is. Pick a page.

23:24.029 --> 23:26.490
Yeah, I will. Yeah.

23:36.667 --> 23:38.001
Okay.

23:38.085 --> 23:39.419
Yeah.

23:43.882 --> 23:45.843
No one's ever heard this before.

23:48.387 --> 23:51.348
"And then, there I was, alone,

23:51.431 --> 23:53.934
with nothing but a flashlight,
my thoughts,

23:54.017 --> 23:57.855
and a bottle of Hemingway
to wash it all down."

23:59.106 --> 24:01.567
Actually, this is more painful
than I thought it would be.

24:01.650 --> 24:03.068
Keep going.

24:06.363 --> 24:10.242
"I found out early
that a good book is a warm blanket"--

24:10.325 --> 24:11.702
Jesus Christ.

24:12.744 --> 24:16.582
"But reality is a chilly place,
and politics is a cold bitch"--

24:16.665 --> 24:18.208
That's unnecessary.

24:19.001 --> 24:23.630
"One that tears away our illusion
of safety and forces us to face the…

24:26.258 --> 24:27.551
dragon of life."

24:29.136 --> 24:30.512
I don't think I can continue.

24:30.596 --> 24:32.014
You can and you will.

24:41.899 --> 24:42.941
That's her.

24:43.025 --> 24:45.611
Don't worry. Just stay focused.
You got this.

24:48.864 --> 24:53.035
Okay. You've had your fun.
Now put on the correct clothes.

24:53.118 --> 24:54.453
These are the correct clothes.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.705
-Shut up, you.
-That's not very kind.

24:56.788 --> 25:00.167
Don't fucking talk to me like that.
I'm not scared of you.

25:01.293 --> 25:02.836
You're not smart enough to be.

25:04.087 --> 25:08.050
-She's not your fucking mother.
-And she is very much not your friend.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.843
You know nothing about her.

25:09.927 --> 25:13.263
She is another imitator. Another parasite.

25:13.347 --> 25:14.723
She listened to me!

25:16.266 --> 25:19.478
All day. To my ideas.

25:20.270 --> 25:21.855
When's the last time you listened to me

25:21.939 --> 25:24.024
instead of bullying me
into listening to you?

25:25.192 --> 25:26.693
Well,

25:27.653 --> 25:29.404
I guess that's it then.

25:30.739 --> 25:32.032
Enjoy your shoot.

25:41.708 --> 25:42.793
Okay.

25:42.876 --> 25:47.673
"My 24th year on this blue marble
would prove to be my boldest.

25:48.382 --> 25:52.970
But that night, I took one more sip
of Ernesto, and off I went.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.223
To discover, to grow,

25:56.306 --> 26:00.853
to pick the fights that needed fighting,
and to win."

26:03.856 --> 26:05.774
That sucked.

26:06.942 --> 26:08.360
You sucked.

26:08.443 --> 26:13.407
Yes, I did. And I do.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.286
And despite all my amateurish predictions,

26:17.369 --> 26:22.082
I neither started any fights nor won any.

26:26.044 --> 26:28.255
Is it any wonder she cheated on me?

26:31.508 --> 26:36.180
So, you're, like, cool with her?

26:36.263 --> 26:41.143
Well, I wouldn't say "cool,"
but I understand it.

26:41.226 --> 26:43.270
-We all do.
-Big of you, man,

26:44.021 --> 26:47.232
considering who she got it on with,
which is like your archenemy.

26:48.025 --> 26:49.693
Wait, what was that now?

26:56.533 --> 26:59.828
Places, everyone.
Places for the top of the show.

27:06.460 --> 27:10.339
Just go get her, Sheila, please.
Just tell her I'm sorry.

27:12.216 --> 27:15.677
Vinnie. Vinnie, you're fine.

27:15.761 --> 27:17.804
You've done this so many times before.

27:17.888 --> 27:20.849
Just go out there and be you.
Just be you.

27:20.933 --> 27:24.645
Shut the fuck up! Just find her, please!

27:26.438 --> 27:28.607
I need her.

27:32.069 --> 27:34.363
Please. Please, Sheila.

27:49.670 --> 27:51.672
You silly fool.

27:51.755 --> 27:55.467
I told you not to get sucked in,
but you wouldn't listen.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.386
You never listen.

27:58.136 --> 27:59.429
You thought you could fix him,

27:59.513 --> 28:01.723
and then all your problems
would disappear?

28:01.807 --> 28:03.058
That I would disappear?

28:06.979 --> 28:08.397
But I'm not going anywhere.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.900
You can't fire me.
You can't tune me out. You need me.

28:11.984 --> 28:15.112
Shut up! Shut the fuck up. Please.

28:15.195 --> 28:17.698
-You'll rot without me.
-I said stop it!

28:17.781 --> 28:19.908
You'll turn into an old, lazy, fat fuck

28:19.992 --> 28:21.994
with nothing to show for yourself.
Nothing to live for.

28:22.077 --> 28:26.623
-No reason to be alive on this planet.
-Get out! Get out of here! Get out!

28:26.707 --> 28:29.543
-Are you all right, ma'am?
-No! No!

28:30.252 --> 28:32.045
I'm not okay! I'm not okay.

28:32.129 --> 28:34.965
I just-- It's--
None of this is working anymore.

28:36.175 --> 28:38.552
I just need some help.

28:45.309 --> 28:46.310
May I help you?

28:46.393 --> 28:49.521
Yeah, I'm Danny Rubin,
here to see my wife, Sheila.

28:49.605 --> 28:53.066
-Rubin?
-Yeah. Sheila Rubin.

28:53.150 --> 28:56.236
I'm sorry, sir. I'm not aware
of any patient by that name.
