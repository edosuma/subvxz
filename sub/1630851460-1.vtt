He said that he wanted to wait

01:46.165 --> 01:48.849
You had actual sex.
That's great.

01:49.001 --> 01:50.943
One time, but it really
just convinced me

Okay. Okay.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.042
So we were always going
to have this conversation.

01:59.044 --> 02:00.619
I just thought
it would happen earlier.

02:00.696 --> 02:03.013
-JUSTIN: Gabby, Gabby, Gabby!
-Ooh, what happened?

02:03.031 --> 02:04.364
Justin's finally gay.

02:13.859 --> 02:15.300
Wait, why are you throwing up?

02:15.377 --> 02:18.211
-You only had one drink.
-Get out!

02:18.288 --> 02:20.046
Gabs, I'm so sorry.

02:20.123 --> 02:21.214
It just happened,

I promise.

02:22.718 --> 02:24.977
Except for my dreams.
I can't control my dreams.

02:25.128 --> 02:26.145

-JUSTIN: Okay!

Gabby, I don't know
why I did that.

Let me see your notes.

44:02.331 --> 44:03.531
I want you to find out
everything you can

44:03.533 --> 44:06.200
about her family,
socioeconomics.

44:06.219 --> 44:08.886
-Who's the father of her kid?
-She didn't want to say.

44:08.963 --> 44:10.721
That means
there's something there.

44:10.874 --> 44:12.056
-Can you figure it out?
-Yeah.

44:12.133 --> 44:14.041
-Why are we doing this?
-'Cause she's our story.

44:14.060 --> 44:16.152
How is she the story?

44:16.229 --> 44:19.304
She's gonna
fall in love with him,

44:19.382 --> 44:21.324
and he's gonna break her heart.
