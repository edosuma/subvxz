01:02.270 --> 01:03.812
I can't sing.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.606
That was fine, Henry.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.982
I can't sing like you.

01:07.650 --> 01:10.152
Of course not.
You're supposed to sing like you.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.155
Dad says I can't carry a tune
in a wheelbarrow.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.615
Dad was joking.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.284
I love your voice.
We both love your voice.

01:21.790 --> 01:25.667
How about "Jingle Bells"?
That you can sing.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.193
Mommy!

01:52.654 --> 01:54.154
Henry.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.702
"--for the third time and said:

02:00.870 --> 02:04.331
'What will you give me
if I spin the straw for you this time also?'

02:04.499 --> 02:08.418
'I have nothing left that I could give,'
answered the girl.

02:08.836 --> 02:13.257
'Then promise me, if you should
become queen, your first child.'

02:13.424 --> 02:17.553
'Who knows whether that will ever happen?'
thought the miller's daughter."

02:28.523 --> 02:31.316
- No! Mommy!
- Henry. Henry.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.819
- There's nothing you can do. No. Shh.
- Let me go! Mommy!

02:33.987 --> 02:36.238
There's nothing you can do.
Listen. Listen to me.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.739
I don't have much time.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.701
You were in the car. It was spinning.
And all of a sudden...

02:40.869 --> 02:42.870
...you were home
and it was two weeks ago...

02:43.037 --> 02:47.624
...and you were watching yourself.
Watching your mom and dad read to you.

02:48.751 --> 02:52.713
You time-traveled, okay?
Just like I did to come to see you.

02:52.881 --> 02:56.884
I'm you, Henry. Understand?
When you're grown up.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.178
We're the same person.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.181
I know that's hard to understand,
but you will someday.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.349
Oh, my God.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.767
I have to go now.

03:06.936 --> 03:11.190
But you don't need to be afraid, Henry.
You're gonna be okay, I promise.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.990
Help that little boy!

04:22.470 --> 04:25.681
- That took you long enough.
- You have no idea.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.182
Okay.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.060
So Christmas Eve. Got any plans?

04:30.228 --> 04:31.853
Yeah, yeah. Big plans.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.191
- Anything else?
- No, thank you.

04:42.490 --> 04:46.201
Merry Christmas. Thank you very much.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.063
Good morning, Chicago.
ChiTown radio time is 8 a.m.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.024
News and sports are coming up next.

05:17.191 --> 05:20.235
Shaping up to be a warm first day of spring
here in the Windy City.

05:25.575 --> 05:29.828
Excuse me. I'm looking for something
on papermaking at Kelmscott.

05:29.996 --> 05:33.081
Our special-collections librarian
can help you with that.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.418
Can I help you?

05:40.965 --> 05:42.591
Henry?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.761
Yes?

05:51.726 --> 05:53.393
Henry.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.187
It's you.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.108
You told me this would happen.

06:00.276 --> 06:04.446
I'm supposed to act normal,
but I'm not really acting very normal.

06:10.119 --> 06:14.331
I'm sorry.
I really have no idea who you are.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.084
I'm Clare.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.586
Clare Abshire.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.048
Now, I know--
I know you don't know me.

06:24.509 --> 06:28.762
Look, I know how odd this must be for you.
It's odd for me.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.722
But, um...

06:31.808 --> 06:35.811
...would you like to have dinner with me,
and I'll explain?

06:37.397 --> 06:40.816
Henry, we've been planning this dinner
for a long time.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.568
We have?

06:44.862 --> 06:48.281
Go to the Beau Thai. It's your favorite.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.493
- It is.
- Mm-hm.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.585
You look like you've been
having a hard time.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.258
You know, everything's gonna be okay.

07:10.513 --> 07:15.142
So, um, is it "yes," then, to dinner?

07:16.769 --> 07:21.273
Okay.

07:23.734 --> 07:24.943
- Okay.
- Yeah.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.778
Yeah. Um....

07:27.280 --> 07:29.781
- So Beau Thai, 7.
- Mm-hm.

07:29.949 --> 07:31.783
See you there.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.187
Oh, shit.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.600
- Hey.
- Oh, man.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.059
Going somewhere, asshole?

08:40.227 --> 08:41.602
I wouldn't bother.

08:41.770 --> 08:43.063
Yeah? Why's that?

08:44.440 --> 08:46.775
- You'll see.
- Shut up.

08:56.452 --> 08:59.120
- Dispatch, Unit 11.
- Go ahead, 11.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.914
I got a--

09:04.710 --> 09:06.127
Jesus Christ.

09:08.798 --> 09:12.968
- would you like another glass?
- Sure. Thank you.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.806
Sorry. I was, uh, detained.

09:18.683 --> 09:21.351
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no big deal.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.396
Thank you.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.482
You do understand
why it is I don't know you?

09:27.984 --> 09:30.277
Uh, of course.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.613
When you're older,
you'll travel back to when I'm a little girl.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.365
For me, ahh--

09:35.533 --> 09:38.994
I mean, I've known you since--
Since I was 6 years old.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.414
Since, um, you appeared in the meadow
behind my parents' house...

09:42.582 --> 09:44.332
...where I used to play.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.167
Um....

09:47.211 --> 09:49.421
You're not really supposed to drink.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.590
Why's that?

09:51.757 --> 09:55.510
Well, you told me that Dr. Kendrick said
that you should stop drinking...

09:55.678 --> 09:58.013
...because it makes you travel.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.933
- Who's Dr. Kendrick?
- He's your doctor.

10:02.560 --> 10:07.856
He wins the Berger for his work in genetics.
He.... He helps you.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.359
This is too much.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.571
I'm sorry.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.450
You told me to go easy on you,
and, um, I'm not.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.121
Ahh....

10:26.626 --> 10:28.960
I wrote down every time
that you came to visit me.

10:29.879 --> 10:33.548
Which I gather I did, or will do,
fairly often.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.843
The last time that I saw you, I was 18.

10:37.053 --> 10:40.639
Seems that you go back
to the same places a lot.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.724
Yeah, it's like gravity.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.893
Big events pull you in.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.229
I was a big event.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.357
So it would seem.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.327
Clare, right?

11:04.246 --> 11:05.372
Yeah.

11:06.082 --> 11:10.085
Could we pretend just for a minute
that this is the first time we've met?

11:13.631 --> 11:15.340
Okay.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.509
Sure.

11:19.136 --> 11:21.054
It's just that....

11:21.222 --> 11:23.598
It's just that you're my best friend.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.686
I've been in love with you all my life.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.067
- Is this really necessary?
- Yeah. Count to 1000.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.610
Ahh....

11:35.778 --> 11:37.112
Okay.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.531
One.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.450
Two.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.578
Three.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.289
Four hundred.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.999
Six hundred.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.544
Eight hundred.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.504
A thousand.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.641
Do you want a drink?

12:17.153 --> 12:19.154
I don't want a drink.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.848
God, you're so young.

13:07.828 --> 13:09.454
Tell me again.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.539
How did we meet?

13:14.585 --> 13:17.086
You're older than you are now.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.673
Maybe I'm not supposed to tell you.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.343
Well, I think I need to know.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.548
Who's there?

14:01.715 --> 14:03.424
Greetings, Earthling.

14:03.592 --> 14:06.427
Mark, you idiot.

14:09.223 --> 14:13.768
Ow! Clare, I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just please don't throw anything at me.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.939
Who are you, how do you know my name,
and why can't you come out?

14:19.024 --> 14:21.276
Can you just hand me the blanket?

14:21.443 --> 14:22.902
Maybe I should call my mom.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.530
No, no, no. Don't call your mom, please.

14:25.698 --> 14:29.033
Just hand me the blanket and I'll leave.

14:43.173 --> 14:45.466
What do you need the blanket for?

14:45.634 --> 14:47.760
I'm a time traveler.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.890
I come from the future.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.310
And when I do,
I don't get to bring my clothes.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.104
There's no such thing as time travelers.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.981
Yes, there is.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.818
In fact, you and I are friends
in the future.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.322
- When you're a lady.
- Am I pretty?

15:07.823 --> 15:09.407
Yes.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.409
Very.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.161
Prove you're from the future.

15:14.538 --> 15:17.540
Well, your name is Clare Abshire.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.460
Born May 24th, 1972.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.671
- Your parents are Philip and Lucille--
- So you know things.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.257
That doesn't prove
you're from the future.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.134
Okay.

15:29.637 --> 15:34.349
This weekend, your brother, Mark,
who's a real pain in the ass...

15:34.516 --> 15:36.517
...falls out of a tree and breaks his arm.

15:37.102 --> 15:41.189
Yeah, but I won't know till then
if you're telling the truth or not.

15:42.024 --> 15:45.652
Well, if you hang around long enough,
you'll see me disappear.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.862
But you just got here.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.074
I'll be back again.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.368
Lots of times.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.453
In fact...

15:56.163 --> 15:59.958
...I'll be back next Tuesday at 4.

16:00.834 --> 16:04.879
And it'd be great if, when you come then,
you could bring me some clothes.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.341
Something your dad won't miss.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.678
Nice to meet you.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.760
Don't worry about that.
It's been over for a while.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.724
This is weird.

18:22.810 --> 18:27.021
I never knew you at this age.
I mean, I've only known you as this...

18:28.357 --> 18:30.191
...mature, worldly person.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.194
I'm competing against myself.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.366
No.

18:44.039 --> 18:47.041
You were just kind of my perfect guy.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.300
I just can't get used to this.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.928
I mean, I just keep waiting for you
to disappear.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.721
Oh, it'll happen, believe me.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.475
How's it feel?

19:04.643 --> 19:07.728
I mean, I know what it's like
to watch you go...

19:07.896 --> 19:11.399
...but what's it like
to always be the one that's going?

19:12.901 --> 19:17.572
Sometimes it feels like
you've stood up too quickly.

19:17.739 --> 19:22.577
Your hands and feet are tingling,
and then they're not there at all.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.706
Sometimes it feels like your attention
has wandered just for an instant...

19:27.416 --> 19:30.251
...then you're standing naked someplace.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.462
Maybe you've been there before,
maybe you haven't.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.008
You don't know how long it's gonna last,
so you start walking...

19:37.176 --> 19:38.593
...till you find some clothes.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.098
Then you seem just like everybody else.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.978
Except you're stranded and all alone,
just waiting to disappear.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.272
But you get to see people from the past.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.275
People who are gone, like your mom.

19:54.693 --> 19:58.070
Yeah, but the thing is,
you can't change what happens to them.

19:58.238 --> 20:01.240
I've tried. It just happens anyway.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.691
- It's nice. Hey.
- And this is Charisse, my roommate.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.318
- Hi.
- My best friend.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.779
- And our excellent cook for tonight.
- Welcome.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.447
Because I don't cook.

20:41.615 --> 20:45.493
Well, you should know that going in.
She's a lovely girl, but she can't cook toast.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.662
- Gomez?
- Yeah, short for Gomolinski.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.830
It's really nice to meet you.

20:49.998 --> 20:53.834
We didn't wanna meet you, but seems to be
the only way to catch a glimpse of Clare.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.628
Please ignore Gomez.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.505
- Do you want some wine?
- No, thanks.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.798
Do you want some water?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.883
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

21:05.973 --> 21:08.224
You didn't tell me how cute he was.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.518
He's not that cute.
Doesn't talk much either.

21:10.686 --> 21:13.020
I couldn't get anything out of him
except he's a librarian.

21:13.188 --> 21:16.023
Well, maybe if you would stop
interrogating him....

21:16.191 --> 21:19.235
You never had a boyfriend.
You spend every minute with the guy.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.529
- Wondering what the draw is.
- Leave her alone.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.740
She's codependent. You thought
she was gonna dodge that bullet?

21:24.908 --> 21:26.534
I don't know.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.287
I just think he's not that cute.

21:29.579 --> 21:32.790
All right,
so can we put the potatoes in yet?

21:32.958 --> 21:36.043
Or do you wanna wait
until the vegetables are done?

21:40.799 --> 21:43.134
- Where's the pan?
- How do I know?

21:43.302 --> 21:45.553
- You can help.
- I don't even live here.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.388
- You--
- First, I'm a man.

21:47.556 --> 21:48.848
Second of all, I'm a guest here.

22:24.801 --> 22:27.261
Are you reading my diary?

22:28.430 --> 22:31.182
Told you that was private.

22:33.101 --> 22:36.604
- I didn't read it.
- Well, it kind of looked like you did.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.399
I was trying to find the dates.

22:40.942 --> 22:43.152
The dates that I go to see you.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.281
So I could tell the little girl in the meadow.
If I'm that important to her...

22:47.449 --> 22:51.577
...I wanted to tell her when I was coming
to see her so she wouldn't have to wait.

22:54.206 --> 22:57.958
Christ, I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.169
I should go.

23:05.175 --> 23:07.009
I'd like you to stay.

23:19.773 --> 23:20.981
You were there all night.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.735
- Come on, kick his ass.
- Guys, check this out.

23:29.116 --> 23:31.951
- Come on, he's a fag. Kick his ass.
- Oh, no.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.369
Come on.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.834
Hey, hey, hey. Break it up, break it up.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.293
- Henry.
- Gomez.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.753
What are you doing?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.338
Goddamn homophobe.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.174
Dude, what in the hell are you wearing?

23:47.926 --> 23:50.970
- What's the date?
- What do you mean, "what's the date?"

23:51.138 --> 23:53.681
- What year?
- What do you mean, "what year?"

23:53.849 --> 23:58.269
- Forget it. I gotta get some clothes.
- Yeah, the pink's not working for you. Hey.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.771
- What are you doing now?
- Picking a lock.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.982
- Huh?
- Close the door.

24:05.402 --> 24:08.779
You wanna tell me what the hell's
going on here? What are you on?

24:08.947 --> 24:10.489
Seriously.

24:10.657 --> 24:15.244
Hey, you know, if you have a problem,
maybe I can help.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.163
Yeah, right.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.416
I don't give a shit about you,
but Clare I care about.

24:20.584 --> 24:25.421
- Why don't you tell me what this is about?
- You wanna know? I'm gonna tell you.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.215
Because you and I are gonna be friends
for a long time.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.717
You might as well know now.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.803
- Know what?
- I look older, right?

24:33.930 --> 24:35.389
That's because I am.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.933
I've come back to this night
from the future.

24:38.101 --> 24:39.977
I'm a time traveler.

24:41.396 --> 24:44.315
Oh, my God, you are out of your mind.

24:44.483 --> 24:46.358
Started when I was 6 years old.

24:46.860 --> 24:50.738
I have fits. I disappear.
I travel through time.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.365
I've come to this night from 2003.
What year is this?

24:53.533 --> 24:55.910
- 1995. I don't like this.
- I get dislocated in time.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.954
I never know when it's gonna happen
or where I'm gonna end up.

24:59.122 --> 25:02.583
I have to break and enter,
steal clothes from the first person I see.

25:02.751 --> 25:03.918
You name it, I've done it.

25:04.085 --> 25:05.920
Uh-huh.
There's something wrong with you.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.630
Yeah, there is.

25:07.797 --> 25:11.342
But I care about Clare more than you can
imagine, so don't worry about that.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.427
Whoa, hey, I'm reassured.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.764
Listen, in the future,
do Charisse and I get married?

25:16.932 --> 25:18.641
Do I go bald? Does Charisse go bald?

25:18.808 --> 25:20.935
I'm not gonna tell you things
about your life.

25:21.102 --> 25:25.022
- Knowing stuff in advance makes you crazy.
- You're full of shit, you know that?

25:26.233 --> 25:28.943
- You won't think that in a minute.
- Yeah? Why's that?

25:42.874 --> 25:44.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.961
- Charisse is out.
- Henry here?

25:47.128 --> 25:50.130
- No, he's at the library.
- Don't marry him, Clare.

25:50.715 --> 25:53.759
- What?
- Just don't marry Henry, okay?

25:54.094 --> 25:57.555
- You know, he hasn't asked me yet.
- Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.225
I love him.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.769
Here. Come here.

26:08.775 --> 26:11.318
I saw him last night at the Vic.

26:11.486 --> 26:15.322
Barrel of laughs. First, he beats up a guy,
then we burglarize the Army-Navy store.

26:15.490 --> 26:19.910
And then he tells me
that he's a time traveler.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.499
You know,
because he travels through time.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.335
And did you believe him?

26:28.503 --> 26:29.837
Um....

26:30.297 --> 26:32.840
Not until he disappeared
right in front of me, you know?

26:33.008 --> 26:34.925
Like, he just disappeared.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.635
Yeah, it's a problem.

26:41.558 --> 26:46.979
- Are you saying you know about this?
- I've known for a very long time.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.566
Okay, I don't know
what the hell's going on, all right?

26:50.734 --> 26:53.944
I don't need to know how the whole thing
works, because I don't care.

26:54.112 --> 26:58.449
But, uh, just presuming for a second that
we're not all out of our fricking minds...

26:58.617 --> 27:01.410
...whatever Henry has, it's, uh....

27:01.870 --> 27:03.704
It's not good.

27:05.332 --> 27:09.168
I've been waiting for him my entire life,
and now he's here.

27:09.377 --> 27:13.172
I mean, it's already happened.
I couldn't even change it if I wanted to.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.554
Well, you're worse off than I thought.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.726
Maybe I am.

27:32.525 --> 27:35.861
That guy stole my wallet. My wallet!

27:39.074 --> 27:43.160
That guy stole my wallet. Hold the train.

28:05.642 --> 28:07.101
Excuse me.

28:08.770 --> 28:11.397
- Are you Annette DeTamble?
- Yes.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.524
I love you.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.653
I mean, your work. Your SINGING.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.113
You have a great voice.

28:21.908 --> 28:24.201
Thank you. I appreciate that.

28:24.369 --> 28:28.539
People don't usually recognize me.
Not on the subway, anyway. Ha, ha.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.124
My name's Henry.

28:31.626 --> 28:32.751
How funny.

28:32.919 --> 28:36.797
I have a son named Henry.
But he's just 3.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.926
I met a girl.

28:42.011 --> 28:45.264
And since I've been with her, I feel safe.

28:46.182 --> 28:50.436
I haven't felt that way for a long time.
Not since I was a kid.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.231
I wish she could hear you sing.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.984
Maybe she will one day.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.578
I'm really glad I met you.

29:09.247 --> 29:11.290
I'm glad I met you too.

29:18.506 --> 29:21.592
Make sure that girl knows
how you feel about her.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.597
Your son loves you very much.

29:28.391 --> 29:30.017
I know.

30:13.311 --> 30:14.978
Hello?

30:17.732 --> 30:19.274
Dad?

30:26.658 --> 30:28.909
What are you doing here?

30:32.914 --> 30:34.748
I was worried.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.042
I called you several times.

30:38.336 --> 30:40.838
I've been ill.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.382
Yeah.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.094
- I called the orchestra.
- Hmm.

30:47.262 --> 30:49.763
They told me you've been on sick leave
since September.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.431
August.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.772
Makes it hard to play the violin.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.318
That's not gonna help.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.654
Sure it does.

31:06.573 --> 31:08.448
- Want one?
- No.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.617
I don't drink anymore.

31:11.452 --> 31:13.120
Pity.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.540
It was our one shared enthusiasm.

31:16.708 --> 31:20.127
First thing we gotta do is get someone
in here to clean the place up.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.671
Make you some meals.
I mean, do you even eat?

31:22.839 --> 31:25.841
I mean, do you want me
to come around more often?

31:26.009 --> 31:27.134
Take you to the doctor?

31:27.302 --> 31:29.970
- Help pay some bills? What?
- No.

31:30.138 --> 31:33.098
No? "No" to what, everything?
Or just some of that?

31:33.266 --> 31:37.728
Get your own life in order
before you start telling me how to live mine.

31:40.106 --> 31:41.982
I'm getting married.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.819
Who would marry you?

31:50.408 --> 31:53.827
- Does she know about--?
- She knows everything about me.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.662
Everything.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.624
Her name's Clare.

31:58.791 --> 32:01.585
Clare Abshire. She's an artist.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.671
I'd really like to give her
Mom's wedding and engagement rings.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.966
That's why I'm here.
And I think Mom would really like that.

32:08.384 --> 32:13.138
How would you know what your mother
would like? You barely knew her.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.973
I knew her.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.017
I still know her now.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.936
I've just seen her on the subway.

32:20.104 --> 32:23.690
I see her pushing me in the stroller.
You know, I see her with you too.

32:23.858 --> 32:26.234
This thing I have isn't always a curse.

32:26.402 --> 32:29.321
Then why don't you keep her
from getting into that goddamn car?

32:29.489 --> 32:31.531
I would if I could. You know that.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.957
I've watched her die hundreds of times.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.626
I can never get there in time to change it.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.736
I still miss her.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.241
I miss her every day.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.869
So do I.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.928
Henry.

34:21.684 --> 34:27.397
I never wanted to have anything in my life
that I couldn't stand losing.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.777
But it's too late for that.

34:33.237 --> 34:36.907
It's not because you're beautiful
and smart and perfect.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.913
I don't feel alone anymore.

34:46.876 --> 34:48.251
will you marry me?

34:56.010 --> 34:57.594
No.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.723
I didn't mean that.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.268
I just wanted to try it.
I just wanted to say it...

35:05.436 --> 35:08.355
...to assert my own sense
of free will. I....

35:09.023 --> 35:10.857
But my free will wants you.

35:11.025 --> 35:12.859
- So it's a yes?
- Yes.

35:14.695 --> 35:16.863
Of course.

35:22.078 --> 35:24.746
A thousand times yes.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.728
- You ever handled a gun before?
- Not exactly. I--

35:48.896 --> 35:50.647
- Hello?
- Mom, we're home.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.440
You are in for a treat, my friend.

35:52.608 --> 35:56.736
Oh, my God. That dress looks like
it's been through the wars.

35:56.904 --> 35:59.906
- I told you to have it shipped.
- Mom, it'll be fine.

36:00.074 --> 36:03.076
Henry, I don't mean to be a nag,
but any word on your father?

36:03.244 --> 36:05.745
- We'll need to adjust the seating plan.
- I'm not sure he'll make it.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.666
Shame. He could've joined in
on the killing spree.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.960
It's how men bond, apparently.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.170
- Philip.
- Pull.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.088
Philip, they're here.

36:20.720 --> 36:24.431
Are you ready for this? It's a real circus.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.267
Yes, I am, sir.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.399
Hope you know what you've signed on for.
With Clare, I mean.

36:35.359 --> 36:36.943
I'm not sure I understand.

36:38.696 --> 36:42.949
Her mother and I didn't succeed in
preparing her for the real world, I'm afraid.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.784
I don't know about that.

36:44.952 --> 36:47.120
She seems to manage pretty well
for herself.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.457
Well, that's good to hear.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.087
Do you ever do any hunting?

36:58.799 --> 37:01.051
No. Never.

37:02.553 --> 37:05.180
Well, maybe I could
take you out sometime.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.682
I'd like that. Yeah.

37:07.850 --> 37:10.268
Usually I'm the one who's getting chased.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.065
You know what they say.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.276
Life's a hunt.

37:22.865 --> 37:24.449
- Good morning.
- Morning.

37:24.617 --> 37:26.326
Have a seat.

37:27.662 --> 37:29.788
What can we do for you today?

37:30.414 --> 37:33.250
- Cut it off.
- All of it?

37:33.417 --> 37:37.921
Yeah, I'm getting married tomorrow.
And my wife, she likes short hair.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.173
Congratulations.

37:40.341 --> 37:45.303
See what we can do for you.
Try to make you happy, the both of you.

37:51.018 --> 37:53.228
- Take your bags?
- I've got it. Thank you.

37:53.396 --> 37:54.896
Very well.

38:04.490 --> 38:07.659
Dad. You came.

38:17.878 --> 38:19.462
Well...

38:20.339 --> 38:22.424
...I suppose I'll have to meet her parents.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.093
Her dad's a Republican.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.511
And a hunter.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.806
Oh, dear.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.809
Give us a second. I gotta take a Vallum.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.061
Vallum? Is that a good idea?

38:35.229 --> 38:37.647
Wouldn't be a wedding without a groom.

38:37.815 --> 38:38.857
Freak.

38:40.234 --> 38:41.401
You okay in there?

38:46.657 --> 38:48.408
Oh, shit.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.411
- Let me get this for you, ladies.
- Thank you.

38:51.912 --> 38:56.333
- This hair, it's always been difficult.
- Mom. Stop already, okay?

38:56.500 --> 38:57.667
It's fine.

38:58.461 --> 39:01.504
But, my God, you are beautiful.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.382
When Henry sees you
coming down the aisle...

39:04.550 --> 39:06.384
...he's gonna pass out on the spot.

39:08.929 --> 39:11.014
Could you go check on the boys?

39:11.182 --> 39:13.767
Okay. Oh, God.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.268
Okay. Oh, shit.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.690
- Are you guys nearly ready?
- Yeah. Yeah, we're good. We're fine.

39:20.858 --> 39:24.402
Great day for a wedding, huh?
Flowers look really pretty and everything.

39:24.570 --> 39:28.073
Everyone else is downstairs waiting.
What do you want me to tell Clare?

39:28.240 --> 39:32.118
We'll just probably be, like, another
half an hour or so to get pretty, and then....

39:32.286 --> 39:36.790
And then, you know, put some pants on,
and then we'll be ready to go.

39:37.458 --> 39:38.708
Five minutes.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.628
I'll let Clare know.

39:42.713 --> 39:43.880
What year are you from?

39:44.048 --> 39:47.300
- You look like my grandpa.
- Don't worry. It all works out.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.302
Oh, great.

39:49.678 --> 39:53.306
I just hope no one notices the gray hair.
You're not gonna have time to shave.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.976
I don't know where they are.

40:49.905 --> 40:51.656
Good luck, darling.

40:52.074 --> 40:54.409
He's got gray hair.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.164
What the hell?

40:59.331 --> 41:01.541
Don't swear. We're getting married.

41:01.709 --> 41:06.379
We are gathered here today to celebrate
the marriage of Henry and Clare.

41:06.547 --> 41:11.050
In the presence of family and friends
and before God, they exchange these vows:

41:12.386 --> 41:17.140
to have and to hold from this day forward,
for richer or for poorer...

41:17.308 --> 41:21.394
...for better or for worse,
in sickness and in health.

41:24.690 --> 41:27.192
And now I'd like to invite
my Lovely daughter...

41:27.359 --> 41:33.031
...and my gallant new son-in-law
to the dance floor.

42:07.316 --> 42:09.442
Howdy, stranger.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.280
Sorry I missed the ceremony.

42:14.448 --> 42:16.616
You didn't.

42:18.494 --> 42:20.787
Do you wish I was him?

42:23.415 --> 42:25.291
But you are.

42:37.137 --> 42:39.722
I wonder if I'm a bigamist.

42:40.099 --> 42:43.142
I think you're allowed to marry the same
person as many times as you want.

43:21.890 --> 43:24.475
Oh, no. Don't.

44:46.392 --> 44:48.059
Finally.

44:48.227 --> 44:51.062
- Clare.
- Who'd you expect?

44:53.607 --> 44:58.027
I brought you a turkey leg.
Our cook roasts the best turkey around.

44:58.445 --> 45:01.572
Well, that's what everyone says, anyway.

45:06.161 --> 45:08.037
My dad was saving it for lunch.

45:09.289 --> 45:13.835
He's been ignoring me,
so I really didn't think he deserved it.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.714
He's been ignoring my mom too.

45:17.881 --> 45:22.301
Alicia says they're really gonna
get a divorce this time.

45:25.305 --> 45:26.639
They're not.

45:28.642 --> 45:31.477
You never told me
anything like that before.

45:31.979 --> 45:34.814
Well, I don't want you to worry
if you don't have to.

45:37.818 --> 45:39.610
Maybe they should get a divorce.

45:40.446 --> 45:43.197
Yeah, maybe.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.701
Are you married?

45:47.995 --> 45:49.579
Yes, I am.

45:50.831 --> 45:55.168
- Is your wife a time traveler?
- No. No, thank God.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.670
Do you Love her?

45:58.839 --> 46:02.175
Yes. Very much.

46:06.346 --> 46:07.346
What's wrong?

46:07.514 --> 46:12.351
Nothing. I was just hoping
you're married to me.

46:23.614 --> 46:25.823
Did you ever think about time?

46:25.991 --> 46:27.617
It goes, Alec.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.994
That's the business of time.

46:30.162 --> 46:32.955
Tick, tick, tick--

46:45.886 --> 46:48.346
I was with you in the meadow.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.098
You were?

46:52.768 --> 46:54.560
You were jealous of my wife.

46:57.689 --> 46:59.398
I was.

47:00.776 --> 47:04.237
I used to try and convince myself...

47:04.404 --> 47:08.241
...that you were married to someone fat
with a mustache.

47:08.784 --> 47:11.911
Well, that is my type.

47:23.924 --> 47:26.092
Come on, let's do this.

47:29.179 --> 47:31.973
- That's great, guys. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

47:34.226 --> 47:35.768
Honey?

47:44.111 --> 47:45.820
Get him, Charlie.

47:45.988 --> 47:47.113
Drop it.

48:42.753 --> 48:45.504
Get back here, you son of a bitch.

48:51.345 --> 48:52.345
You're back.

48:52.971 --> 48:54.347
Did I miss Christmas?

48:54.514 --> 48:57.683
Yeah. And New Year's.

48:59.394 --> 49:01.979
Henry, you've been gone two weeks.

49:02.147 --> 49:05.149
I couldn't get back. I tried everything.

49:05.692 --> 49:07.860
Even got drunk trying to trigger it.

49:08.028 --> 49:10.112
Guess that didn't work.

49:12.991 --> 49:15.952
Um, I have to go.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.204
Now? I just got here.

49:18.372 --> 49:22.416
I know, but I have a show in two weeks.
Jeremy gave me a space to work in.

49:22.584 --> 49:26.295
I mean, this place is too small.
I can't work here anymore.

49:26.463 --> 49:29.215
And, Henry, my life doesn't stop
because you're gone.

49:29.383 --> 49:30.716
I never said it did.

49:34.137 --> 49:35.721
- Could we talk about this?
- Talk?

49:35.889 --> 49:38.975
I have been here for two weeks
wanting to talk to you.

49:39.142 --> 49:40.476
What do you wanna talk about?

49:40.644 --> 49:44.397
I mean, how bad it feels to sit here
and wait for you?

49:46.233 --> 49:48.025
I'm going to work.

49:55.283 --> 49:57.201
This is gonna be great. Have no worries.

49:57.369 --> 49:58.911
All right. Thank you, sir.

49:59.079 --> 50:00.579
- Good night.
- Good night.

50:00.747 --> 50:03.249
- Yeah, I can't believe that.
- Yeah.

50:38.076 --> 50:41.537
- We'll never make it in time.
- In time for what?

50:41.705 --> 50:45.583
Somewhere in America, moments from now,
there could be a new multimillionaire.

50:45.751 --> 50:48.919
Good evening, everybody. I'm Dave Long.
It's Tuesday....

50:49.087 --> 50:51.714
- You can't be in here.
- We have to watch something.

50:51.882 --> 50:54.675
- The TVs are gonna set you off.
- We have to watch something.

50:54.843 --> 50:58.971
- To win, all you have to do....
- What's that?

50:59.139 --> 51:00.598
Good luck.

51:03.018 --> 51:04.310
What'd you do?

51:04.478 --> 51:06.228
Our first winning number is...

51:06.396 --> 51:09.815
- Seventeen.
- ...seventeen.

51:14.279 --> 51:15.946
Up next:

51:16.114 --> 51:19.784
- Maybe a 23.
- Number 23.

51:20.327 --> 51:22.369
Or even a 32.

51:23.830 --> 51:25.998
Thirty-two is next.

51:27.584 --> 51:32.338
- Couldn't possibly be a 40.
- Followed by 40.

51:33.048 --> 51:35.633
- That shouldn't be a 12.
- And our last number is...

51:35.801 --> 51:37.843
...a 12.

51:39.304 --> 51:41.847
So here are your winning numbers:

51:42.516 --> 51:49.522
- Seventeen, 23, 32, 40 and 12.
- You just won $5 million.

51:49.689 --> 51:51.315
You can't do that.

51:51.483 --> 51:53.818
It's-- It's cheating.

51:54.194 --> 51:58.906
- Okay. Let's rip it up.
- No.

51:59.866 --> 52:03.786
Look, there are a lot of downsides
to my condition, okay?

52:03.954 --> 52:05.454
But this is not one of them.

52:07.749 --> 52:10.793
Exquisite plasterwork
in every room of the house.

52:10.961 --> 52:12.920
Isn't it gorgeous?

52:14.422 --> 52:16.215
This is not it.

52:17.175 --> 52:20.136
- But I like it.
- You'll like another one more.

52:22.848 --> 52:26.559
Just look at the fireplace.
It's got the "wow" factor.

52:26.726 --> 52:29.186
The details, the architecture,
the windows.

52:29.354 --> 52:32.565
- Spectacular.
- No. Not the one.

52:33.150 --> 52:34.984
Uh, thank you.

52:39.156 --> 52:43.951
Just look at this landscaping.
Wouldn't you love to see it in the spring?

52:44.327 --> 52:48.247
Now, it's a little smaller
than the other places, but big on charm.

52:49.082 --> 52:52.710
Now, the main entrance of this house
is actually towards the rear...

52:52.878 --> 52:55.588
...where there is a charming garden.

52:55.755 --> 53:01.302
But look at these features. The fireplace.
That staircase, it's so handsome.

53:01.469 --> 53:04.096
The wide-plank flooring. Love that.

53:07.767 --> 53:09.351
Clare.

53:11.771 --> 53:13.814
- We're home. See the garage?
- Uh-huh.

53:13.982 --> 53:15.274
- That's your studio.
- Aah!

53:15.442 --> 53:16.817
Come on. Come on.

53:16.985 --> 53:18.569
Come on.

53:21.406 --> 53:22.489
So here's the garden.

53:22.657 --> 53:24.325
- And over there is my studio.
- Oh, my.

53:26.453 --> 53:28.579
- Things are going okay.
- This is....

53:28.747 --> 53:29.788
- Mint?
- Yes.

53:29.956 --> 53:31.248
- And black for you.
- Mm-hm.

53:31.416 --> 53:33.792
- How many more of these do you want?
- Three's good.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.502
He's awake.

53:35.670 --> 53:37.963
- He's kicking. Max is kicking.
- Oh!

54:23.176 --> 54:25.552
Do you know when you're gonna die?

54:33.728 --> 54:35.145
No.

54:37.357 --> 54:39.692
I've never seen you older.

54:41.861 --> 54:44.280
I've never seen you older
than 40-something.

54:45.073 --> 54:46.532
Never.

54:48.743 --> 54:50.202
Maybe you stop--

54:50.370 --> 54:52.621
Maybe you stop traveling.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.878
Somebody-- Somebody finds a cure.

55:00.046 --> 55:04.216
There's gotta be some kind of drug
you can take. There's gotta be someone....

55:04.592 --> 55:06.802
Something. Something that can help.

55:15.895 --> 55:17.563
We're having a baby.

55:21.526 --> 55:22.818
What?

55:39.419 --> 55:40.919
I....

55:41.588 --> 55:43.797
I think it's time.

55:44.799 --> 55:47.634
It's time you find Dr. Kendrick.

55:50.555 --> 55:52.431
How did you say you found me?

55:54.100 --> 55:55.809
When I'm older...

55:55.977 --> 56:00.189
...I travel back in time to see my wife
when she's a little girl.

56:01.524 --> 56:04.443
She says I mentioned a Dr. Kendrick.

56:04.611 --> 56:09.698
one an ENT, one a podiatrist, so....

56:09.866 --> 56:12.034
I'm a geneticist.

56:14.120 --> 56:16.622
And I have a genetic anomaly.

56:16.790 --> 56:18.415
It's called Chrono-Impairment.

56:20.627 --> 56:25.297
That's a term you came up with, apparently.
That's what she says.

56:25.632 --> 56:28.467
Of course, now I've mentioned it,
you will call it that...

56:28.635 --> 56:31.428
...and it'll be hard to tell
which came first.

56:32.680 --> 56:35.307
You see, that's the thing
about time travel.

56:39.229 --> 56:44.108
Did my students put you up to this?
Because, man, you are good.

56:44.275 --> 56:46.985
Oh, God.

56:48.071 --> 56:49.822
You got me.

56:55.578 --> 56:58.122
I knew this would be a waste of my time.

56:59.999 --> 57:04.002
Wait a minute. Uh, wait. Here.
Henry, wait.

58:02.437 --> 58:04.062
Hey.

58:12.572 --> 58:14.990
I lost the baby.

58:39.641 --> 58:41.099
Kendrick.

58:43.394 --> 58:45.103
Mr. DeTamble.

58:45.647 --> 58:47.606
My wife had a miscarriage.

58:51.319 --> 58:55.739
I am very sorry about that,
but I don't see what I can do to help.

58:55.907 --> 58:58.742
What if the baby's a traveler like me?

58:59.452 --> 59:03.288
What if it has the same genetic anomaly?
What if it traveled out of the womb?

59:03.748 --> 59:07.793
You need help.
Not the kind of Help I can give you.

59:08.253 --> 59:10.379
How can I prove it to you?

59:10.797 --> 59:14.466
You can't. It's impossible.

59:14.842 --> 59:16.468
Well, just do one test.

59:17.637 --> 59:22.140
If you don't find anything, fine. I'll leave
you alone, you can go back to your life.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.268
I'm calling Security.

59:25.687 --> 59:27.312
The grant.

59:27.480 --> 59:29.356
The Berger Grant.

59:32.318 --> 59:36.446
- Have you applied for it yet?
- How did you find out about that?

59:38.491 --> 59:39.491
You win.

59:50.503 --> 59:54.506
We're going to start the first series.
It'll take about 10 minutes.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.045
Oh, shit.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:42.220
Your brain emits a blast
of electromagnetic energy...

01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:46.767
...akin to an epilepticâ€™s
right at the moment you travel.

01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:49.603
And you can see it right here.

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:53.023
Now, there are drugs for epilepsy
we can use.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:58.737
But all of these drugs
are way too strong for a fetus...

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:02.407
...if, indeed, it is a similar condition
which is causing the miscarriage.

01:01:03.284 --> 01:01:07.412
I'm 10 weeks in now,
and we've never been that far along...

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.665
...so maybe the baby isn't gonna travel.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.708
We're going to find out.

01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:14.503
We're going to take a look
at Henry's genetic code.

01:01:15.129 --> 01:01:18.256
We'd like to take a look
at the clock genes.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:21.343
And then I would like to run the same test
on the fetus.

01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:26.181
Not to worry.
It's a noninvasive extraction of cells.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.558
But perhaps we'll get
some sort of indication...

01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:31.269
...as how to bring you to full term.

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:53.458
Honey.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.919
- What?
- Wake up. You're bleeding.

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:58.547
What?

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:11.727
We could adopt.

01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:20.569
What's wrong with me wanting
one normal thing in my life?

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:25.782
I wanna be a mother.
I wanna bear a child, your child.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:28.201
Why can't I have that?

01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:33.165
I've never seen us with a baby. Never.
I've traveled to the future...

01:02:33.332 --> 01:02:35.834
- ...and I've never seen it.
- I don't wanna hear that.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:39.254
- You heard what the doctor said. You'd be--
- Stop.

01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:52.184
Okay, Henry.

01:02:52.351 --> 01:02:56.062
Uh, just to be official about this,
I need to ask you one last time:

01:02:56.230 --> 01:03:00.525
- You're sure you wanna do this?
- Yeah, yeah. I've signed the papers.

01:03:00.693 --> 01:03:04.821
Yeah. Yeah, I know, but, uh, vasectomy's
rarely a one-party decision.

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:07.991
Yeah, well, this time it is.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.035
You all right?

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:11.745
- You need us to call someone?
- No.

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:13.246
A cab?

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:28.553
Henry.

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:37.687
Hey. What's the matter?

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:40.690
I don't really feel like being here
right now.

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.739
Is it me?

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:49.574
No.

01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:52.619
I did something.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.081
It was hard, and you won't like it.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:59.417
What'd you do?

01:03:59.585 --> 01:04:01.419
You won't like it.

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:04.297
Well, then why'd you do it?

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:08.718
- To stop us from fighting.
- We're fighting?

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.137
Why?

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:16.059
Well, just once, one time, could you--?

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:19.771
Could you tell me the answer
to something I'm asking you?

01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:22.607
You wouldn't get it anyway.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:31.908
That wasn't very nice.

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:38.123
You've never kissed me before.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:05:59.871
I was with you in the meadow.

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:08.213
- When?
- You looked about 18.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:11.299
It was our first kiss.

01:06:14.679 --> 01:06:16.012
Hmm....

01:06:17.765 --> 01:06:19.516
You were having a bad day.

01:06:20.893 --> 01:06:22.769
I did something.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:25.981
I did something I felt I had to do.

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:30.443
Oh, please don't tell me something
that's gonna make me hate you.

01:06:37.034 --> 01:06:39.244
I had a vasectomy.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:42.747
I'm not gonna have a child...

01:06:42.915 --> 01:06:46.042
...with the same genetic disorder as me
who's gonna die. I--

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:48.044
I'm not gonna do it.

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:51.548
How dare you?

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:56.177
You tricked me.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.138
You--

01:06:58.305 --> 01:07:00.015
You came to that meadow...

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:04.394
...and you forced yourself into the heart
and the mind of a little girl.

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:07.772
What, you think that I wanted this life...

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:10.734
...this husband that disappears
without any kind of warning?

01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:14.404
Do you think anyone would want that?
Who would want that?

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:20.952
- You have a choice.
- I never had a choice.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.520
Hello?

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:19.404
Thanks for coming.
It's freezing out there.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:22.991
Where's Henry?

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:25.326
Uh, I left him sleeping.

01:09:28.037 --> 01:09:30.415
I needed some time away from him.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.917
How's that working out for you?

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:40.800
You okay?

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.178
We had a fight.

01:09:43.929 --> 01:09:46.180
It was bad.

01:09:49.935 --> 01:09:53.938
Yeah, well,
he can be a pain in the ass, that guy.

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:12.957
It's really good to see you.

01:10:44.865 --> 01:10:56.501
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:11:24.363 --> 01:11:26.239
What's up with you?

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:29.909
What?

01:11:31.704 --> 01:11:33.329
You're weird.

01:11:33.872 --> 01:11:35.748
Been weird all week.

01:11:35.916 --> 01:11:37.709
I'm pregnant.

01:11:41.171 --> 01:11:43.673
Do you remember the night
in the parking lot?

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:46.050
When I came to get you?

01:11:46.218 --> 01:11:48.011
You were younger.

01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:49.512
Before the surgery.

01:11:55.352 --> 01:11:58.855
I mean, it's not like I cheated on you.

01:12:04.194 --> 01:12:06.362
If we lose this baby,
if something happens to--

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:08.364
From now on...

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:10.908
...we're not gonna fight anymore.

01:12:11.076 --> 01:12:13.786
We're not even getting excited.

01:12:13.954 --> 01:12:17.498
I mean, if stress is what's causing
the traveling...

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:22.670
...then we should give this baby
the most serene gestation on the planet.

01:12:25.382 --> 01:12:28.760
Eighteen weeks and perfectly healthy.

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:32.847
And you asked about the sex.

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:38.436
It's a girl.

01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:45.109
It's got a really strong heartbeat.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.700
What about "Mia"?

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.911
That's really pretty.

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:57.747
Where'd you get the book?

01:12:58.665 --> 01:13:00.583
From Charisse.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:03.336
"Jane"?

01:13:03.962 --> 01:13:06.881
I used to name all my dolls Jane.

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:11.302
I'm not sure
we should be talking names yet.

01:13:12.262 --> 01:13:14.472
I'm just getting some ideas.

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.237
- Look, there's a man in there.
- See that?

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.447
- Oh, yeah. Oh, look.
- Doesn't have any clothes on.

01:13:31.615 --> 01:13:34.283
- What is he doing in there?
- Shit.

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:38.496
- Check this out.
- Wow, I don't believe that.

01:13:38.664 --> 01:13:41.165
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

01:13:48.298 --> 01:13:51.384
- Come down this way.
- But I wanna see the lion.

01:13:54.346 --> 01:14:01.018
Daddy.

01:14:09.194 --> 01:14:10.862
Come on, let's go.

01:14:11.029 --> 01:14:12.488
Come on.

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:17.994
- This is the first time we've ever met.
- How do you do?

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:20.705
- How old are you?
- Ten. How about you?

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:22.039
Thirty-eight.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:26.294
So tell me about you. How's school?
What are you learning?

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:30.214
Well, not much at school.
But I read all the time. I read about Egypt.

01:14:30.382 --> 01:14:32.383
Mom and I are reading
The Lord of the Rings.

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:34.969
And Grandpa's teaching me the violin.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:36.554
And I heard Grandma sing.

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:42.226
It was beautiful. At the opera. Aida.

01:14:42.686 --> 01:14:46.564
- What, you time-traveled?
- Mom says you and I are exactly alike.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:48.691
Except Dr. Kendrick says I'm a prodigy.

01:14:48.859 --> 01:14:50.735
Because sometimes
I can choose where I go.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:54.822
You can control it?
When you go and when you come back?

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.032
I'm learning.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.076
I saw you and Mom walking in the street
before I was born.

01:14:59.244 --> 01:15:01.078
You walked right by me.

01:15:01.246 --> 01:15:03.748
- You were arguing.
- I bet.

01:15:06.376 --> 01:15:10.254
It's so good to meet you, Alba.
It's so good to see you.

01:15:10.422 --> 01:15:12.840
Me too, Daddy. Me too.

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.218
I've really missed you.

01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:22.600
How long has it been?

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:26.646
How old were you when I died? It's okay.

01:15:27.439 --> 01:15:29.106
Five.

01:15:29.274 --> 01:15:31.901
- Five?
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have told you.

01:15:32.069 --> 01:15:35.154
No, no, it's okay. It's okay. I just....

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:39.867
I haven't traveled
past my own life before.

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:44.956
- How's your mom?
- She's okay.

01:15:45.123 --> 01:15:46.374
Sad.

01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:49.794
Alba, what are you doing?

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.380
- That's my teacher.
- Get over here right now.

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:55.216
You better go.
I don't want you to get in trouble.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.968
Come here.

01:16:04.142 --> 01:16:05.685
Go.

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:14.485
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too, honey.

01:16:41.513 --> 01:16:43.180
Alba.

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:46.517
Alba?

01:16:49.354 --> 01:16:51.272
We name her Alba.

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:57.236
- You met her?
- Yeah.

01:16:57.696 --> 01:16:59.947
She's so beautiful.

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.199
And so smart.

01:17:02.367 --> 01:17:04.660
You're gonna love her so much.

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:15.630
So everything's gonna be okay?

01:17:16.131 --> 01:17:17.548
Yeah.

01:17:19.384 --> 01:17:21.552
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:17:22.387 --> 01:17:24.180
- Push. She's coming.
- Deep breathing.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:26.807
- Push. Come on.
- Keep going. Come on.

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:29.143
- More.
- There you go.

01:17:29.519 --> 01:17:31.896
Good work. There you go.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:35.191
Congratulations. She's beautiful.

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:37.526
Oh, my God. Oh.

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:44.408
Shh, shh, shh.

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:09.225
Hi.

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.802
Henry?

01:18:54.771 --> 01:18:57.314
Do you know who Alba's playing with?

01:18:58.692 --> 01:18:59.900
It's gonna happen.

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.694
- That's Alba.
- When?

01:19:01.862 --> 01:19:04.321
Yes, but who's she with?

01:19:04.489 --> 01:19:06.157
Your daughter.

01:19:06.324 --> 01:19:09.577
They're both your daughter.
She's time traveling.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:10.911
Oh.

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:12.163
This year.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:16.834
Is it too weird?

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:21.338
No. I think it's kind of magical.

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:30.389
Hey. Where's Alba?

01:19:31.683 --> 01:19:33.559
She's gone.

01:19:38.064 --> 01:19:40.191
Honey, you wanna talk about it?

01:19:41.693 --> 01:19:43.235
No.

01:19:56.416 --> 01:19:57.875
- Hey. Do you want a hand?
- Nope.

01:19:58.043 --> 01:19:59.710
Are you sure?

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:02.546
Okay. Okay.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:05.841
That's right, sing:

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:14.350
Come on.

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.070
What was that about?

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:27.655
What was what?

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.907
Why is she so upset?

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:33.077
She was just sad for a minute, I guess.

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.080
Okay, what does she know?

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:40.167
Tell me, or I'll imagine the worst.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:44.588
Go ahead and imagine it.
I mean, you're gonna do it anyway.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.351
You all right?

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.019
Mm-hm.

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:01.021
Thanks.

01:21:10.448 --> 01:21:13.200
Did you have a nice birthday?

01:21:16.746 --> 01:21:19.206
Honey, you know,
if something's bothering you...

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:21.750
...you can always tell Mommy.

01:21:22.794 --> 01:21:24.253
No, I can't.

01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:26.463
Why not?

01:21:26.923 --> 01:21:29.884
Because Daddy told me not to.

01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.138
And you love Daddy.

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:37.141
But sometimes Daddy can be wrong.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:41.478
You wanna tell me what it is?
It's okay if you do.

01:21:41.646 --> 01:21:44.648
- You promise?
- I promise.

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:48.652
Daddy's going to die.

01:21:52.282 --> 01:21:54.325
Who told you that?

01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:57.119
Alba told me.

01:22:00.957 --> 01:22:02.458
She did?

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:07.004
She told me that Daddy would die
when I was 5 years old.

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:27.441
Alba told me that you die
when she's 5 years old.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:38.369
The day that you landed in the hallway,
you were shot.

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:43.165
That's it, isn't it?

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:44.625
You get shot.

01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:51.090
I honestly don't know. I--

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:07.898
I'm scared.

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.920
- It's dead.
- But why?

01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:31.672
That's just what happens.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.427
We're born, we live,
and then when we get old, we just die.

01:23:46.604 --> 01:23:47.938
Help me.

01:23:56.614 --> 01:24:00.242
- How did he get hypothermia?
- We need to let them do their work.

01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:03.287
He said that some guys were chasing him,
and it was snowing...

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:06.415
...and he got on this freight-car train,
and then somebody locked him in.

01:24:07.792 --> 01:24:09.918
And-- Oh, God.

01:24:10.086 --> 01:24:12.713
They're going to save his foot.

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:17.843
Now, he's going to be in a wheelchair for
a few months, but he's going to be all right.

01:24:19.971 --> 01:24:22.347
But he has to be able to walk.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.558
He has to be able to run.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.685
If he can't run....

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.529
Daddy?

01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:41.742
Are you dying?

01:24:42.535 --> 01:24:44.036
No.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:49.458
Are you going to have to be
in this chair from now on?

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:56.090
Only for a little while, honey.

01:25:06.392 --> 01:25:10.604
Things are happening fast now, honey.
I'm traveling a lot.

01:25:11.314 --> 01:25:14.733
It might be because of
what they're giving me for the pain.

01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:19.488
Try to stay, Daddy.

01:25:19.864 --> 01:25:21.490
Well, how do you do it?

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:24.701
When I feel like I'm going...

01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:26.537
...I sing.

01:25:26.704 --> 01:25:28.622
I sing to myself.

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:34.169
Let's try that.

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:06.076
Clare.

01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:08.912
- Clare.
- I'm calling the hospital.

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:48.952
This'll come in handy one day.

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.581
No, you need to feel it, honey.
It'll tell you when to twist.

01:26:55.627 --> 01:26:57.794
Oh, that's my girl.

01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:01.048
- This smells great, Mommy.
- That's ready.

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:04.134
- Straight over. Don't forget the baster.
- I've got it.

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:06.803
- Be generous.
- Yeah. It's hot.

01:27:06.971 --> 01:27:08.639
Lots.

01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:10.766
- Oh!
- Careful.

01:27:10.934 --> 01:27:13.143
There you go. Okay, it's ready.

01:27:16.648 --> 01:27:18.232
Done.

01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:21.360
Look, everyone. It's snowing.

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.073
Oh, honey, your coat.

01:27:31.037 --> 01:27:32.496
Okay.

01:27:34.374 --> 01:27:37.334
There. There you go.

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:41.171
Thank you.

01:27:51.557 --> 01:27:52.849
Wow!

01:27:53.017 --> 01:27:54.685
It's beautiful.

01:27:54.852 --> 01:27:57.813
Can we open the presents tonight?

01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:59.481
What presents?

01:27:59.649 --> 01:28:02.192
Santa doesn't come till you're asleep.

01:28:03.194 --> 01:28:06.238
I already looked in the closet.

01:28:06.406 --> 01:28:09.783
Alba, that closet was locked.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:19.001
Christmas is in the morning.

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:22.587
That's the rule.
No presents on Christmas Eve.

01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:25.340
Well, then what are we gonna do?

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:46.778
I'm gonna get you!

01:28:46.946 --> 01:28:49.656
Slow down. You almost slipped there.

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:52.743
Come on, this way.

01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:54.453
Okay.

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:12.179
- You need anything?
- No.

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.680
- Oh, I'm good, hon.
- Okay.

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:15.223
- Hey, Gomez.
- Hey.

01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:16.641
Come outside for a minute.

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:19.978
- It's cold out there.
- Don't be an old man.

01:29:20.146 --> 01:29:21.438
Come on, just take a second.

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:25.525
Well, I've never considered
myself a performer, but I'd like to try.

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.618
What, uh...?

01:29:34.994 --> 01:29:36.536
What's up?

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:43.126
Just wanted to say
thanks for everything, man.

01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:46.630
- You've been a great friend.
- What are you talking about?

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.301
Something might happen tonight.

01:29:52.011 --> 01:29:53.637
All right?

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:56.014
And I just wanna let you know...

01:29:56.808 --> 01:30:00.310
...that I know I've been a pain in the ass,
but you've been great.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:03.480
It's all been great.

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:10.195
Yeah. Don't mention it.

01:30:11.197 --> 01:30:13.156
You guys crazy?

01:30:13.991 --> 01:30:16.410
It's freezing. Baby, put this on.

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:19.162
Gomez, just give us a minute, man.

01:30:31.509 --> 01:30:34.177
Guys, can you believe it?

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:41.518
We're gonna give them a minute or two.

01:30:45.815 --> 01:30:47.691
Henry?

01:30:52.321 --> 01:30:58.535
No.

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:00.912
Come here.

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:05.000
Come on.

01:31:35.239 --> 01:31:38.366
Why did you let me invite
all these people?

01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:42.245
I didn't want you to be alone.

01:31:51.964 --> 01:31:54.382
Hey. Hey.

01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:59.596
I wouldn't change anything.

01:32:01.807 --> 01:32:03.892
I would not give up...

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:07.896
...one second of our life together.

01:32:56.404 --> 01:32:58.446
- Got it?
- Yeah. Shh, shh.

01:32:59.282 --> 01:33:00.740
Dad. Dad.

01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:14.629
I knew I clipped it.

01:33:14.797 --> 01:33:17.299
- I don't see any tracks.
- Yeah.

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:20.010
Let's try over here.

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:35.817
Clare.

01:33:36.402 --> 01:33:39.029
- Clare.
- I'm calling the hospital.

01:33:39.196 --> 01:33:40.947
Okay.

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:46.578
I love you. More than anything.

01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:50.540
I love you. I'll always love you. Always.

01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:52.375
Stay here.

01:33:59.884 --> 01:34:01.509
Alba, sweetie.

01:34:01.677 --> 01:34:03.470
Daddy.

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:07.474
Oh, Henry.

01:34:09.852 --> 01:34:11.603
Henry.

01:34:13.272 --> 01:34:15.357
Sweetheart.

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:36.438
Aah! Whoa.

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:46.823
- Daddy?
- Alba.

01:35:47.950 --> 01:35:50.994
Daddy, I knew I'd see you again.
I knew it.

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.795
- How old are you? When is this?
- I'm 9.

01:36:00.963 --> 01:36:04.007
You're 9?
And your mom still leaves clothes?

01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:06.509
She says you never know.

01:36:06.677 --> 01:36:10.638
You remember Max and Rosa, don't you?
Gomez's kids.

01:36:10.806 --> 01:36:12.015
They're so grown-up.

01:36:13.392 --> 01:36:18.021
Run back to the house, you guys.
Tell Mom he's here. Tell her to come.

01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:19.355
Let's go.

01:36:19.523 --> 01:36:20.648
Wait up.

01:36:22.067 --> 01:36:25.403
Tell me the story
of how you and Mama met.

01:36:25.571 --> 01:36:29.699
- Doesn't she tell you?
- She does, but not like you do.

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:32.535
Well, it was right here in this meadow.

01:36:34.163 --> 01:36:36.456
And one fine day...

01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:39.292
...your mom,
who's just a tiny little thing...

01:36:40.044 --> 01:36:43.046
...goes out to the clearing,
and there's a man there.

01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:46.508
- With no clothes.
- Not a stitch on him.

01:36:46.675 --> 01:36:49.385
After she gives him a blanket
she happens to be carrying...

01:36:49.553 --> 01:36:53.556
...he explains to her
that he's a time traveler.

01:36:53.724 --> 01:36:57.894
Now, for some reason
I'll never understand...

01:36:58.729 --> 01:36:59.854
...she believes him.

01:37:00.022 --> 01:37:01.189
Because it's true.

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:04.567
Henry?

01:37:08.113 --> 01:37:10.073
- I'm going.
- No, Daddy. Sing.

01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:12.492
I can't sing.

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:29.759
Henry.

01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:38.226
- Where are you from?
- I'm 39.

01:37:38.602 --> 01:37:41.437
Alba's just a baby.
We're in the house. We're happy.

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:45.400
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
I would've been here waiting.

01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:47.235
I didn't want you to wait.

01:37:49.613 --> 01:37:51.781
I don't want you
to spend your life waiting.

01:37:51.949 --> 01:37:53.283
Hmm....

01:37:54.034 --> 01:37:55.660
I love you.

01:37:58.414 --> 01:37:59.622
I can't stay.

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:02.292
I know.

01:39:00.225 --> 01:39:02.018
Sometimes I think he's in the trees...

01:39:02.186 --> 01:39:04.646
...deciding when to come out
and surprise me.

01:39:04.813 --> 01:39:07.398
I used to think that
when I was a little girl.

01:39:07.566 --> 01:39:10.401
That he was always here,
even when he wasn't.

01:39:10.569 --> 01:39:13.321
I guess he is, isn't he?
