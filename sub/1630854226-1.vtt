You're doing this.

31:48.734 --> 31:49.769
Come on, this way.

31:51.323 --> 31:53.946
- Successfully throwing
blades at a human target

31:53.981 --> 31:55.361
was an art form.

31:56.604 --> 31:58.606
Now, first you find your
throwing line...

31:59.572 --> 32:01.264
That's this.

32:01.298 --> 32:04.612
Okay, now the key
to successfully throwing

32:04.646 --> 32:07.304
a blade is the distance between
you and the target.

32:08.650 --> 32:10.721
Now, if you've found your
throwing line,

32:10.756 --> 32:12.861
you're gonna
take a step back.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.969
And you're gonna turn
45 degrees and to your left.

32:18.626 --> 32:21.284
Okay, now you're gonna
step up to that line

32:21.318 --> 32:23.562
and throw it just like a
baseball pitch.

32:23.596 --> 32:25.288
Hard as you can.

32:29.637 --> 32:31.639
- Hmm.
What!

32:31.673 --> 32:34.262
Baby, that was sick!

32:34.297 --> 32:37.438
So, how is this related
to the Creeper?

32:38.991 --> 32:42.132
- They say these are some
of his favourite toys.

32:42.167 --> 32:44.065
- Seems inefficient.

32:44.100 --> 32:45.998
- To prolong the hunt.

32:47.586 --> 32:49.760
There is the
minor drawback that

32:49.795 --> 32:51.279
even if you hit your target,

32:51.314 --> 32:53.799
you throw away your weapon.

32:53.833 --> 32:55.766
You need something else
to finish the job.

32:57.182 --> 32:58.977
- Hmm...

32:59.011 --> 33:00.668
Or if the Creeper throws like
Chase, then he would need it.
