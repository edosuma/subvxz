JAY: You shouldn't even be working.

00:15.808 --> 00:18.394
You OD'd. For all I know,
you're high right now.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.354
How about you and I keep our distance
from one another?

00:20.438 --> 00:22.732
Just as soon as you stop treating patients

00:22.815 --> 00:24.108

Could you say that any louder?

00:37.997 --> 00:39.957
Not sure everybody heard you.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.041
Sorry.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.710
I wasn't trying to blow your spot.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.211
Yeah, well, remember.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.389
Let's start over.

Okay, can we talk?

00:57.266 --> 00:58.267
About options to get clean?

00:58.350 --> 00:59.977
Yeah, like I appreciate
you wanting to help,

01:00.060 --> 01:01.937
but I'm not really in the mood
for a lecture right now.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.024
Hannah. You're a doctor.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.525
You know what you're doing to your body.

01:06.609 --> 01:08.736
Yeah, so, I know that
this can't last forever.

to do something about it?

all down your lower back.

Could that be related?

in my apartment, maybe?

that leave the injection site,
or am I special?

07:11.849 --> 07:13.308
I'm just concerned.

Yeah, okay, if I had known
going to a safe injection site

07:16.603 --> 07:17.688
would result in you hounding me,

he hit his head.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.880
So, what brings you in today?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.673
I was changing Xavier's clothes
this morning,

07:44.756 --> 07:46.049
and I noticed a sore on his hip.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.260
Maybe I left him on his side too long?

and dress the wound.

Okay.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.707
So, it should never get to this point.

We try to turn him regularly.

that can help with that.

with some antibiotics,

pretty well.

under control,

but my main concern is his right leg.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.894
The muscle is dying,
and it's poisoning his blood,

10:02.978 --> 10:04.438

He might rather be dead
than have only one leg, he...

10:36.511 --> 10:37.888
You sure there's nothing else you can do?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.265
Not that I'd advise.
Please, tell me.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.228
We could move him to the ICU

10:45.312 --> 10:47.731
and do the best we can to keep him alive.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.650
That might give us some time
for him to wake up

10:50.734 --> 10:53.028
and make the decision himself.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.446
Okay.

10:54.529 --> 10:55.530
Let's do that.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.450
Every second we wait increases the risk

10:58.533 --> 11:00.202
of him dying of multi–organ failure.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.661
I understand, but...

11:03.080 --> 11:04.664
He should be the one to decide.

11:06.541 --> 11:07.542
Okay.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.466
I'll be back in a moment.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.678
Hey.
Yeah?

11:18.762 --> 11:20.097
I am not comfortable with this.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.140
That woman was abused by her husband.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.433
You sure about that?
Yes.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.603
And in my opinion, she should
not be making this decision.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.949
What are the chances
Mr. Tyler does wake up on his own

11:39.032 --> 11:40.075
to make this call?

11:41.660 --> 11:42.661
Slim.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.496
Rick needs to have his leg amputated.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.915
And I don't think it's right
to have Kim decide

11:46.998 --> 11:48.083
if he's been abusing her.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.336
Why not?
Because it's a life or death call.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.131
And she's not in the right frame
of mind to make it.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.007
She's too vulnerable, and it's a decision

11:56.091 --> 11:57.884
she'll have to live with
for the rest of her life.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.678
So, let me get this straight.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.598
We're gonna take away the legal rights
of an abuse victim

12:03.682 --> 12:04.724
because she was abused.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.935
No, it's more complex than that.

12:07.018 --> 12:08.520
I mean, considering the emotional

12:08.603 --> 12:11.606
and psychological burden
that Kim's been under,

12:11.690 --> 12:14.067
I really feel like the hospital
should step in.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.402
She's his wife.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.070
She's entitled to make this decision.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.574
Then, you're in favor of him
not having the surgery?

12:20.657 --> 12:22.534
I'm in favor of respecting the rights

12:22.617 --> 12:24.453
of the next of kin to decide...

12:24.536 --> 12:26.496
Even if it goes against
what's best surgically.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.958
All right, I'll convene
an ethics committee.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.628
Until then, do everything you can
to keep Mr. Tyler alive.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.181
Strange, isn't it?

12:44.264 --> 12:45.432
Mmm–hmm.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.934
Is this consistent
with a vegetative state?

12:48.018 --> 12:49.019
No, it is not.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.813
You know what? Send me his chart.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.523
Okay? As soon as you can.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.608
ELSA: Okay.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.946
What was Dr. Charles doing in here?

13:00.906 --> 13:04.576
Um, I thought he might have some insights
into Xavier's condition.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.787
Have you guys noticed
that his legs can stay up like this?

13:09.164 --> 13:10.665
We thought that was part of his condition.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.250
Ms. Curry? A word.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.755
Excuse me.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.258
Ms. Curry, you had no right
to consult another department

13:20.342 --> 13:21.885
without clearing it with me first.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.054
You were busy and I had a concern.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.347
I mean, how do you explain Xavier's leg

13:25.430 --> 13:26.431
staying up on its own?

13:27.015 --> 13:29.893
Probably just spasticity, which is common
in a vegetative state.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.312
Well, I've never heard of muscle stiffness
causing that presentation.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.648
Look, this kid was brought in
for a pressure ulcer,

13:34.731 --> 13:36.316
so that is what we're treating him for.

13:37.901 --> 13:38.944
Okay.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.282
Nina, you ready for a scratch test?

13:48.286 --> 13:49.579

13:54.084 --> 13:57.504
The couple in Treatment 3 is having sex.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.714
(SIGHS) I don't get it.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.050
The ED is about the last place
I'd ever wanna have sex.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.134
I know.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.470
You know what?

14:06.555 --> 14:09.224
God bless the couple that can't keep
their hands off each other

14:09.307 --> 14:10.809
even in this place. (CHUCKLES)

14:10.892 --> 14:11.893
Yeah.

14:14.563 --> 14:15.564
What's going on?

14:15.647 --> 14:17.107
Dr. Lanik is sending them home.

14:17.899 --> 14:18.900
Oh.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.238
I'm Dr. Charles with psychiatry.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.490
I have been reviewing
Xavier's medical records.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.826
And I think that
there's a very good chance

14:27.909 --> 14:29.035
that he was misdiagnosed there.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.704
Misdiagnosed?

14:30.787 --> 14:33.331
Yeah, I don't think your son
is in a vegetative state.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.625
Do you know how his joints,

14:35.709 --> 14:38.044
they stay in the same position
after they've been moved?

14:38.128 --> 14:41.423
Mmm–hmm.
That's something called waxy flexibility.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.883
It is indicative of only one condition.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.802
Catatonia.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.137
Catatonia?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.389
Yeah, it's a neuropsychiatric disorder

14:49.472 --> 14:52.309
that can lead to paralysis,
but it's treatable.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.811
And this was caused by the head injury?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.022
I'm suggesting that this has nothing to do

14:57.105 --> 14:58.273
with your son hitting his head.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.109
What's going on?

15:01.192 --> 15:03.695
He's saying our son might be catatonic.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.530
Xavier was fully evaluated

15:05.614 --> 15:08.325
before being diagnosed as being in a PVS.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.702
Catatonia's a pretty rare condition,

15:10.785 --> 15:13.330
so without a psychiatrist weighing in,

15:13.413 --> 15:16.207
it's possible that the doctors
at Norris weren't even looking for it.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.460
Yeah, but Xavier fell off his bike.
He hit his head.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.211
Yeah, but the scans were inconclusive,

15:20.295 --> 15:22.255
meaning that there was
no clear brain injury.

15:23.214 --> 15:24.215
Look.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.801
I think that I can help your son.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.263
But in order for me to do that,
he needs to stay here.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.183
Look, I'm just trying to spare you
a bunch of tests

15:33.266 --> 15:35.310
your son doesn't need, so you don't
wind up right back where you are.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.397
Wait.

15:43.735 --> 15:44.736
We're staying.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.239
All right, well, he is discharged
from my service,

15:48.323 --> 15:50.784
so, Dan, if you wanna admit him to yours,

15:50.867 --> 15:51.868
be my guest.

15:52.744 --> 15:53.745
Put him back in his room please.

and she just passed out.

16:06.758 --> 16:07.967

16:17.060 --> 16:19.020
and 0.3 milligrams of epi IM, stat.

Yeah, push a mil IV.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.200
Baby, baby, come on, come on.
No, no, no, no, no.

16:34.285 --> 16:35.286
I'm in.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.291
Stats are coming up.
Pressure's still soft.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.584
All right, keep the fluids running.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.670
Fifty of Benadryl IV, start racemic epi,

16:43.753 --> 16:45.213
and give her another dose
of epinephrine IM.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.464
What caused this?

16:53.096 --> 16:56.808
Catatonia only freezes
the voluntary muscle groups,

16:56.891 --> 16:59.227
not the involuntary ones
like those that help us breathe.

16:59.936 --> 17:03.106
So if I'm right,
and Xavier is indeed catatonic,

17:03.189 --> 17:04.733
he does not need
the ventilator to breathe,

17:04.816 --> 17:06.151
and we can disconnect it.
Wait.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.529
But isn't that dangerous? The doctor said
he'd die without it.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.449
They said he wasn't...
What's the expression?

17:12.532 --> 17:14.617
Protecting his airway.
He has a trach.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.203
Which means that we can
always reconnect the vent if he needs it.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.712
Do, uh, do we have your permission?

17:32.343 --> 17:33.344
Yes.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.388
Okay.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.473
Ms. Curry?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.825
Okay, SATS are dropping. 92.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.828
Ninety.
Isn't that bad?

17:58.912 --> 18:01.498
Not necessarily.
As carbon dioxide builds up,

18:01.581 --> 18:02.874
it should kick his respiratory system
into drive.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.502
Eighty–five.

My little boy!

18:32.779 --> 18:35.657
What does this mean? What do we do now?

18:35.740 --> 18:36.866
Well,

18:36.950 --> 18:39.369
probably not a bad idea
to try and figure out

18:39.452 --> 18:41.412
what put him into a catatonic state
in the first place.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.346
So the first doctor to explain catatonia

18:58.429 --> 19:02.225
about 150 years ago,
Dr. Kahlbaum, described it as

19:02.308 --> 19:05.103
"immobility induced
by severe mental shock,"

19:05.186 --> 19:06.354
like an emotional trauma.

19:06.437 --> 19:10.733
Well, I mean it's like a...
Like a deer caught in the headlights.

19:10.817 --> 19:13.778
But instead of bounding into the forest,

19:13.862 --> 19:15.655
they stay there, frozen.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.365
What, like PTSD?

19:18.241 --> 19:20.410
I'm a cop. I've seen PTSD.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.496
It doesn't look anything like this.
And there's been no trauma.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.331
Xavier was always a happy kid.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.084
Okay, you mind telling me
a little bit more about...

19:28.167 --> 19:29.168
About your home life?

19:29.961 --> 19:30.962
It was good...

19:32.630 --> 19:33.798
Before this happened.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.176
I mean, there have been
some rough patches.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.555
My ex, Xavier's father,
left us high and dry

19:40.638 --> 19:42.098
when Xavier was a little boy,

19:42.181 --> 19:44.392
but we got through it.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.355
And then Alvin came into the picture.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.816
Yeah, we started dating five years ago.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.610
We've been living together
for the past three years.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.778
How about school?

19:56.487 --> 19:58.990
Xavier's always been a good student.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.408
Loved reading.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.202
Friends?
Lots.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.914
I used to take them all
to White Sox games.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.291
He did watch this movie Poltergeist,

20:08.374 --> 20:12.253
which gave him nightmares.
But that was a few years ago.

20:12.337 --> 20:15.840
Unlikely that one movie
is gonna induce catatonia.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.800
I have to take this.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.969
I'm working a task force with the DEA.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.054
Sorry.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.223
Alvin here. Yeah.

20:24.307 --> 20:27.226
How did Xavier feel about Alvin's work?

20:28.394 --> 20:31.648
Alvin's always been good
about not bringing it home with him.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.567
He took all the precautions.
Keeps his gun in a safe.

20:34.651 --> 20:37.654
But still, did he ever talk to you
about how he felt about

20:37.737 --> 20:39.530
the fact that Alvin was a police officer?

20:39.614 --> 20:41.658
Xavier's a 10–year–old boy.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.618
Alvin being a cop is like

20:44.661 --> 20:46.329
having a superhero sleeping down the hall.

20:46.412 --> 20:47.413
Hmm.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.374
Why would you ask that?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.211
Just trying to get some background.

20:54.545 --> 20:57.090
Alvin's the best father figure
Xavier could ever have.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.885
You don't have to worry about that.

21:07.725 --> 21:08.851
Hey, why did you stop?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.311
It seemed like you were on to something.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.814
I think we're getting
to a sensitive area here.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.818
So I just like to, you know, take a pause
before we push forward,

21:17.610 --> 21:19.362
but Alvin's work life

21:20.071 --> 21:22.365
is absolutely something
that we want to look into.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.417
Nina's stable for now.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.794
It doesn't make sense.
The antihistamine was working.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.130
So she must have been
re–exposed to the allergen.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.257
I guess we can move her to a clean room.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.967
But she had the rash before
she even came to the hospital.

21:41.551 --> 21:44.512
Yeah, I just wish we could've
gotten that scratch test.

21:44.595 --> 21:47.557
I tried, but they were indisposed.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.225
Before I could get back in there,
she crashed.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.309
Indisposed?

21:51.185 --> 21:52.478
What do you mean, "indisposed?"

21:53.938 --> 21:55.440
Were they having sex?

21:56.065 --> 21:57.066
Yeah.

21:59.277 --> 22:00.278
We need to talk to Harlan.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.116
Harlan, I'm not here to judge you,

22:05.199 --> 22:07.035
but I gather you and Nina
had sex in the hospital.

22:07.118 --> 22:10.913
(STAMMERS) Uh, I'm sorry
you had to walk in on that.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.499
Did you finish?
Jeez, man.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.376
It's pertinent, Harlan. We need to know.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.461
Did you ejaculate?

22:17.545 --> 22:19.881
I did, yes.

22:20.590 --> 22:22.675
I'm gonna write her an order.
You need to go to the lab.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.732
Maggie.
MAGGIE: Yeah.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.108
What's the story with the patient in 5?

22:40.068 --> 22:42.403
Uh, second trimester with preeclampsia.

22:42.487 --> 22:43.571
Dr. Asher's seeing her now.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.075
You all right?

22:49.494 --> 22:51.829
Yeah, just have to do something
I don't want to do.

22:52.497 --> 22:55.333
Well, in my experience,
better to not hesitate.

22:55.416 --> 22:56.626
Just rip the Band–Aid off.

22:58.669 --> 22:59.670
Thanks.

23:12.266 --> 23:15.686
So after reviewing the details
of Rick Tyler's case,

23:15.770 --> 23:18.356
the ethics committee
has decided to take away

23:18.439 --> 23:20.233
decision–making rights from Kim.

23:20.316 --> 23:21.317
Wow.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.237
Kim's choice to wait
on amputating Rick's leg

23:24.320 --> 23:26.948
puts his life at unnecessary risk

23:27.031 --> 23:28.908
and the committee believes that Kim,

23:28.991 --> 23:31.994
whatever her circumstances,
doesn't appreciate that risk.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.247
(SCOFFS)

23:34.330 --> 23:35.331
Okay.

23:35.414 --> 23:39.043
So you can take Mr. Tyler to surgery.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.128
All right.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.631
I have to go tell Kim now.

23:43.714 --> 23:45.007
Why don't I come with you?

23:45.091 --> 23:46.175
Thanks.

23:47.510 --> 23:48.553
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Yeah?

23:50.304 --> 23:52.181
Dr. Charles?
Come on in.

23:53.349 --> 23:56.686
I called over to CPD, and I found out some

23:56.769 --> 23:58.604
pretty interesting things
about Detective James.

23:59.397 --> 24:00.398
Without asking him?

24:02.108 --> 24:03.359
Why?

24:03.442 --> 24:06.154
Because you said you didn't want
to bother them?

24:06.904 --> 24:08.656
Until they were ready to talk again.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.868
What about their privacy, Elsa?

24:11.951 --> 24:13.077
Alvin's not the patient.

24:13.161 --> 24:15.204
I mean, it's not like I violated
anyone's HIPAA rights.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.082
Well, that is, in fact, debatable,

24:18.166 --> 24:19.709
but you definitely violated their trust.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.837
This family's in a very
delicate place, Elsa.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.131
They... They need to feel
like we're on their side,

24:25.214 --> 24:26.716
or they could just walk out the door.

24:27.383 --> 24:28.384
Okay.

24:31.345 --> 24:32.972
Do you wanna see what I found out or not?

24:40.104 --> 24:42.315
What's going on?
This is Sharon Goodwin.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.150
She's the Executive Director
of Patient Services.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.818
What's going on?
We're moving forward

24:45.902 --> 24:47.403
with your husband's amputation.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.030
But I said I wanted to wait!

24:49.113 --> 24:52.158
The hospital believes
it's in your husband's best interest

24:52.241 --> 24:54.493
to take control of his medical decisions.

24:54.577 --> 24:57.788
Why?
Kim, I saw signs of abuse.

24:57.872 --> 24:59.707
We don't think you should
have to be responsible

24:59.790 --> 25:01.500
for someone who might be hurting you.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.169
(SOBBING)

25:03.252 --> 25:05.338
Kim? Hey, Kim.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.801
Whatever your situation is,
it does not have to stay that way.

25:11.677 --> 25:12.678
You can talk to us.

25:12.762 --> 25:14.472
When he wakes up,

25:14.555 --> 25:17.183
and he remembers I was driving the car...

25:19.810 --> 25:21.562
It is my fault he lost his leg!

25:21.646 --> 25:24.440
There are shelters that can
provide you a safe haven.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.319
You'll be taken to a secret location
where no visitors are allowed.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.571
Please, Kim. Let us help you.

25:35.159 --> 25:36.160
Okay.

25:37.745 --> 25:38.746
I'll think about it.

25:45.253 --> 25:47.046
(KIM CONTINUES CRYING)

25:52.843 --> 25:55.179
Detective James, I want to apologize.

25:55.263 --> 25:57.682
I called CPD to ask about you.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.433
My thought was that
I might learn something

25:59.517 --> 26:03.020
that could be helpful,
but I... I overstepped, and I'm sorry.

26:03.104 --> 26:04.313
Xavier's your patient.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.065
Why would you be checking up on me?

26:06.148 --> 26:07.316
DANIEL: Ms. Curry made a mistake.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.026
A serious mistake.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.530
I just hope that you'd appreciate that

26:12.613 --> 26:14.615
what she was trying to do
was gain a better understanding

26:14.699 --> 26:16.701
of Xavier's situation so that

26:16.784 --> 26:18.119
we can give him the best possible care.

26:18.202 --> 26:22.581
And I hope she learned what a good man...
What a good cop Alvin is.

26:22.665 --> 26:23.874
DANIEL: Matter of fact, she did.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.377
You have an outstanding record, Detective.

26:26.460 --> 26:30.172
You took out the Southside Ministers gang
on your own?

26:30.256 --> 26:31.799
I had a lot of help.

26:33.175 --> 26:36.095
Sounds intense. I mean,
they put a hit out on you.

26:36.178 --> 26:37.179
They blew up your car.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.640
What does this have to do with anything?

26:39.724 --> 26:42.143
Well, it just sounds like
a pretty monumental event.

26:43.144 --> 26:45.479
Do you think that there's any chance that

26:45.563 --> 26:46.856
Xavier could've been aware of it?

26:47.690 --> 26:49.859
I don't think so. The car was parked
around the corner.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.653
So, he didn't witness any of it?

26:53.237 --> 26:55.448
I mean, he may have seen
the wreckage towed away.

26:55.531 --> 26:57.700
There's no way he could've
understood what happened.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.036
But I'm sure you were
probably pretty upset, Vanessa.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.330
You think that he could've
picked up on that?

27:02.413 --> 27:04.040
Alvin moved out after that.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.709
He stayed away while there was
an active threat against him.

27:07.710 --> 27:10.713
Just out of curiosity,
when did you move back in?

27:12.173 --> 27:14.925
It was about a week
before Xavier became catatonic.

27:21.849 --> 27:24.435
Alvin would never let
anything happen to us.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.562
He didn't do anything wrong.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.689
I'm not suggesting that he did.
Then what are you suggesting?

27:29.482 --> 27:32.234
I'm suggesting that Alvin works
in a very scary world

27:32.318 --> 27:35.696
and that, on some level, Xavier very much
understands that.

27:36.322 --> 27:39.033
And his fear about
the possible consequences

27:39.116 --> 27:41.160
could very well have triggered
his catatonic state.

27:41.243 --> 27:43.412
So what does this mean?
That Alvin needs to leave us?

27:43.496 --> 27:45.247
Look, honey, it's just...
No, you are the best thing

27:45.331 --> 27:47.458
that's ever happened to me and Xavier.

27:49.293 --> 27:50.294
We've heard enough.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.599
Hey, Sean.
Will.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.102
I have you on schedule for tomorrow night.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.062
Right. Thing is...

28:09.605 --> 28:11.023
It's not such a good idea
for me to be involved

28:11.107 --> 28:12.274
with the site right now.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.027
Wait, we're really starting
to make a difference with these people,

28:15.111 --> 28:16.445
in large part 'cause of you.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.323
Appreciate that.

28:19.407 --> 28:21.075
But I want what's best for the site,

28:21.158 --> 28:23.160
and that means I have to go.

28:23.244 --> 28:24.245
I'm sorry.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.373
Are we at risk here?

28:28.499 --> 28:30.626
I think my leaving will protect you.

28:32.670 --> 28:33.671
Thanks.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.886
ETHAN: Think you're ready
to have this out.

28:41.595 --> 28:42.596
Take a deep breath.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.266
All right, hard exhale.

28:45.349 --> 28:46.475
(COUGHING)

28:46.559 --> 28:47.935
ETHAN: There we go.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.355
What happened?

28:51.439 --> 28:53.691
You had another allergic reaction.

28:53.774 --> 28:54.775
Yeah, I'm...

28:55.651 --> 28:56.652
I'm the problem, honey.

28:57.695 --> 28:58.988
It's me.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.448
What are you talking about?

29:00.531 --> 29:02.867
We ran tests on Harlan's semen,

29:02.950 --> 29:04.535
and it turns out you're allergic to it.

29:05.161 --> 29:06.495
What?

29:06.579 --> 29:07.830
No...

29:07.913 --> 29:10.374
It was never an issue before
because you used condoms,

29:10.458 --> 29:12.543
which you stopped once you started trying
to get pregnant.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.754
His semen? Come on.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.383
Oh, my God. So what are you saying?

29:19.467 --> 29:20.468
We can't have sex anymore?

29:20.551 --> 29:23.304
Yeah, what about kids?
ETHAN: There are options.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.264
We'll get you to a fertility specialist.

29:25.347 --> 29:26.974
There are multiple
procedures you could do.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.350
We'll also set you up with an allergist.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.020
There might be some methods
to help you build up a tolerance.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.189
With treatment,
your sensitivity may lessen.

29:33.981 --> 29:36.650
Meanwhile, you can go back
to having sex with condoms.

29:38.903 --> 29:41.822
Hey, you two obviously love one another.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.532
You'll work this out.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.369
Just keep an EpiPen on your nightstand.

29:55.878 --> 29:57.963
You know, walking in on them like that

29:58.881 --> 30:00.424
got me thinking, um...

30:01.133 --> 30:02.927
Ever since we started IVF,

30:03.010 --> 30:06.347
I feel like the only time you touch me

30:07.223 --> 30:09.016
is when you're injecting me with hormones.

30:13.896 --> 30:14.897
You're right.

30:16.732 --> 30:18.108
How about we have a date tonight?

30:18.984 --> 30:19.985
And stay home?

30:20.986 --> 30:21.987
I'd like that.

30:32.665 --> 30:33.666
Come in.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.419
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.090
You got a minute?
Of course.

30:53.602 --> 30:54.603
Um...

30:55.521 --> 30:56.522
You were right.

30:57.856 --> 30:58.857
My job.

31:00.484 --> 31:02.069
I do bring my work home with me

31:03.320 --> 31:04.321
whether I want to or not.

31:07.408 --> 31:08.409
And Xavier knows that.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.373
"Do the bad guys know where we live?"

31:14.456 --> 31:15.499
He asked me that once.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.335
And I told him that they didn't.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.547
But the fact that he had to ask...

31:23.591 --> 31:24.592
I mean, it kind of says it all.

31:25.843 --> 31:26.844
Doesn't it?

31:28.679 --> 31:29.680
Yeah.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.975
My job is to protect people.

31:34.560 --> 31:35.603
And if I can protect my...

31:37.313 --> 31:38.314
My son

31:39.773 --> 31:42.234
just by stepping aside,
then that's what I'm gonna do.

31:46.864 --> 31:48.824
Look. Alvin.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.203
If you feel you need to get a little space

31:53.287 --> 31:54.580
while Xavier's coming out of this,

31:54.663 --> 31:56.749
while he's recovering his faculties,

31:56.832 --> 31:58.083
maybe that's not a bad idea.

31:59.209 --> 32:00.669
But

32:00.753 --> 32:02.713
as soon as he's ready to start the therapy

32:02.796 --> 32:04.632
that he needs to process his fear,

32:05.382 --> 32:06.842
you need to be right there next to him,

32:07.968 --> 32:10.179
so you can heal together.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.222
And move forward.

32:15.851 --> 32:16.852
Like as a family?

32:17.561 --> 32:18.562
Yeah.

32:28.238 --> 32:29.406
Is he going to wake up now?

32:30.574 --> 32:33.410
Well, after the surgery,
and all the drugs,

32:33.494 --> 32:35.079
it'll be a while before he does.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.163
Okay.

32:39.083 --> 32:40.918
This might sound crazy, but...

32:44.338 --> 32:46.090
I think he really does love me.

32:48.425 --> 32:49.468
That's not crazy.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.555

32:53.639 --> 32:55.432

33:09.863 --> 33:10.864
Yes, hi.

33:10.948 --> 33:12.408
How's Ms. Tyler doing?

33:12.491 --> 33:13.617
She's anxious.

33:13.701 --> 33:14.993
Understandable.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.537
I think I can allay some of her fears.

34:22.436 --> 34:23.687
She had options.

34:23.771 --> 34:26.190
I imagine she couldn't stomach the idea

34:26.273 --> 34:28.442
of looking over her shoulder
the rest of her life

34:28.525 --> 34:30.402
waiting for her husband to get even.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.070
I thought we'd reached her.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.698
Considering what just happened,

34:35.657 --> 34:39.787
Kim might have run that red light
this morning on purpose.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.039
And if she was willing
to sacrifice herself

34:42.122 --> 34:43.665
to stop her husband's abuse?

34:44.958 --> 34:46.794
I doubt there was any way to reach her.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.138
Dr. Charles!

34:59.431 --> 35:00.682
Look, he's moving.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.106
Xavier, honey? Can you hear me?

35:10.526 --> 35:11.944
What do you want, baby?

35:14.154 --> 35:15.656
You thirsty?

35:15.739 --> 35:17.658
I can go get him some ice chips.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.454
(GASPS)

35:28.293 --> 35:29.294
(CRIES WITH JOY)

35:30.295 --> 35:31.296
Mommy's here.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.091
I'm here, baby. (CONTINUES CRYING)

35:35.342 --> 35:36.385
Mommy's here.

35:39.680 --> 35:40.973
(SIGHS)

35:46.353 --> 35:47.354
(STRANGLED SOB)

35:48.897 --> 35:50.232
Did he wake up?

35:50.315 --> 35:51.817
Yeah.

35:51.900 --> 35:52.943
Looks like he's coming out of it.

35:54.945 --> 35:57.072
(VOICE BREAKS) That's my boy.

36:00.784 --> 36:01.785
Um...

36:02.995 --> 36:05.873
Will you send Vanessa out here

36:07.207 --> 36:08.208
when the time is right?

36:09.543 --> 36:10.544
Absolutely.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.136
Hey, you good? I heard what happened.

36:20.304 --> 36:21.305
It was awful.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.474
A lot of fine surgical work went to waste.

36:25.517 --> 36:27.978
Really? That's all you have to say?

36:29.104 --> 36:30.898
No, actually, I'd like to add

36:30.981 --> 36:33.817
that if we just let it be,
he would've died on his own.

36:35.903 --> 36:38.030
Hey, you can't kill someone
who's already dead.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.406
Can't even be tempted.

36:39.489 --> 36:40.991
Is that why you were so adamant

36:41.074 --> 36:42.492
about having Kim decide?

36:44.536 --> 36:45.746
Let me put it like this.

36:47.748 --> 36:50.667
A victim of abuse is being hauled off
to jail.

36:51.919 --> 36:53.921
And in my opinion, that's a lousy outcome.

36:57.925 --> 36:58.967
I'll see you tomorrow, Natalie.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.229
That was a good catch today, Ms. Curry.

37:11.313 --> 37:13.148
(SIGHS) Yeah, right.

37:14.483 --> 37:16.652
"Yeah, right"? Look, if it wasn't for you,

37:16.735 --> 37:20.530
Xavier might be back home on a vent
for who knows how long.

37:21.365 --> 37:23.241
Really good thing that
you piped up when you did.

37:24.201 --> 37:25.494
Good work. Well done.

37:45.222 --> 37:47.933
(DOLLAR NOTES RUSTLING)

37:50.394 --> 37:54.272
Asking a junkie to meet you in a bar.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.316
Not exactly sensitive.

37:58.485 --> 37:59.486
I guess not.

37:59.569 --> 38:00.612
Just a water for me.

38:03.073 --> 38:04.074
Sit.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.370
Look, I'm sorry about this morning.

38:08.453 --> 38:11.289
I may have overreacted a bit.

38:11.373 --> 38:12.374
That's okay.

38:16.503 --> 38:17.504
Hannah,

38:18.463 --> 38:19.464
I can't let this go on.

38:22.384 --> 38:24.803
If you won't turn yourself in...

38:24.886 --> 38:26.805
Look, I thought we had an understanding.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.391
I quit the injection site.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.187
I thought that it meant so much to you?

38:36.189 --> 38:37.190
Not more than this.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.194
I never would've turned you in.

38:41.278 --> 38:42.279
I just... I got...

38:43.530 --> 38:45.407
Desperate and scared.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.286
But you can't...

38:50.871 --> 38:53.081
You can't possibly know what it's like.

38:54.875 --> 38:57.085
Every day I say I'm gonna quit and yet...

38:57.878 --> 38:58.879
Hannah.

39:03.592 --> 39:04.718
You don't have to do this alone.

39:06.011 --> 39:07.763
I'll be there. I'll help you.

39:14.186 --> 39:15.187
What?

39:16.688 --> 39:17.689
You care

39:19.441 --> 39:20.442
about me.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.360
I do.

39:24.154 --> 39:25.155
I do care.

39:35.540 --> 39:36.792
I will turn myself in.

39:39.836 --> 39:40.837
First thing in the morning.

39:44.299 --> 39:45.759
I can go with you.
Yeah.

39:45.842 --> 39:46.843
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

39:49.429 --> 39:50.430
Yeah, I'd like that.

39:51.723 --> 39:52.724
Okay.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.483
Come to my place?

40:23.338 --> 40:24.798
Hey.

40:24.881 --> 40:25.882
Check it out.

40:27.134 --> 40:28.135
Looks good.

40:29.094 --> 40:30.637
Now we just have to set up the nursery.

40:42.524 --> 40:43.525
But in the meantime...

40:46.695 --> 40:47.696
How about that date?

41:00.959 --> 41:01.960
Hey.

41:02.961 --> 41:03.962
Everything okay?

41:08.508 --> 41:09.509
Yes.

41:10.260 --> 41:11.261
Come here.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.442
