01:56.158 --> 01:58.118
Last summer, Mama gave me

01:58.202 --> 02:00.663
this flashlight to signal the aliens.

02:00.746 --> 02:03.165
She said, "Of course
there's life out there.

02:03.249 --> 02:05.960
Now go outside."

02:06.043 --> 02:10.130
But now it's just me and y'all,
the aliens of the universe,

02:10.214 --> 02:12.883
so if you can hear me...

02:12.967 --> 02:17.263
I am Christmas Flint, human female.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.017
I think you'd like me.

02:22.101 --> 02:25.104
I think you'd want to be my friend.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.286
Dang it.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.986
And I don't want no ketchup stains

03:14.069 --> 03:16.196
- on those pages again.
- Yes, ma'am.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.552
Mama believed that sound waves

03:38.636 --> 03:40.888
travel out into the universe.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.184
She said that if I ever got lonely,

03:45.267 --> 03:47.144
I should just send my message out.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.527
Joseph!

03:55.611 --> 03:56.779
All right, give me the ball.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.031
- Uh-huh.
- Here you go.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.622
Ramsey Flint, attorney-at-law.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.958
- What it is, boss?
- What it is, boss.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.336
Now, now, hold up, Joe Frank.
I'm your attorney.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.630
Yeah, you got to listen to me.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.091
Not about the property line now.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.968
That is a big tractor, Joe Frank.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.845
I'd advise you get out of the way.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.723
This is legal advice.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.266
You not hungry?

04:26.350 --> 04:28.310
No, I'm talking to the dog.

04:28.394 --> 04:30.437
Hey, I'm just trying to save your life.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.231
That's the boss man.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.149
He's my dad.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.484
Damn it.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.777
He's doing his best.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.529
It ain't his fault he loses so much.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.614
- Where are my pants?
- Since Mama died,

04:40.698 --> 04:42.116
he's been losing everything.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.201
Boss, when we're done talking,

04:44.284 --> 04:47.121
you think our words travel
out into the universe forever?

04:47.204 --> 04:49.790
I sure as heck hope not.

04:49.873 --> 04:52.001
I swear...

04:52.084 --> 04:54.586
I'm gonna pop somebody,
I don't get my damn money.

04:54.670 --> 04:55.963
Miss Rayleen?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.589
I got to go down,

04:57.673 --> 04:59.550
take care of Joe Frank in Live Oak.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.884
Where are your pants?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.803
You 400 in the hole, and you talking

05:02.886 --> 05:04.430
- about Joe Frank.
- Now, listen...

05:04.513 --> 05:06.348
That's Miss Rayleen.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.559
She's an intergalactic warrior.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.936
You know what? You the boss,
but you a broke-ass boss.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.105
But she crash-landed here,

05:13.188 --> 05:15.482
working for my dad
instead of going to law school.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.735
Ain't nothing wrong helping somebody.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.194
Still,
she's the smartest person

05:19.278 --> 05:20.612
- you're gonna meet.
- We can discuss this later.

05:20.696 --> 05:23.615
I got to find my pants. You move my pants?

05:23.699 --> 05:25.242
I don't have anything to do
with your pants.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.994
Mr. Ramsey, hi. I can't pay you yet,

05:27.077 --> 05:28.787
but I brought you some avocados.

05:28.871 --> 05:31.290
- Avo-what?
- A-Avocados.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.793
It's the good Lord's way
of saying "mayonnaise."

05:34.877 --> 05:36.170
Huh?

05:36.253 --> 05:37.296
Uh, we'll get your payment soon.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.547
You don't need no mayonnaise.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.465
You need some money. You know how much

05:39.548 --> 05:40.841
you have in your bank account?

05:40.924 --> 05:42.718
- I do. It ain't pretty.
- You pay... Th-Thank you, miss.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.219
You pay her no mind.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.637
- Everybody's doing their best.
- I'm going to the deck.

05:45.721 --> 05:48.640
I'm doing my best
not to whup your ass.

05:48.724 --> 05:52.061
Boss... h-hold up.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.979
Got to make contact, though.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.397
I know you ain't walking around
looking like that.

05:55.481 --> 05:56.440
Take that off.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.108
Look at that hair.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.278
People gonna think
you were raised by wolves.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.322
♪ Oh, yes ♪

06:03.405 --> 06:05.866
♪ I'm the great defender... ♪

06:05.949 --> 06:08.035
- What it is, boss?
- What it is, Dwayne.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.328
What it is, Miss Rayleen?

06:09.411 --> 06:10.871
If it ain't $200 for the petty theft,

06:10.954 --> 06:12.873
- I don't want to hear it.
- That can wait.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.709
I'm gonna need his services, actually.

06:15.793 --> 06:18.212
Let's go. Prepare to fall out.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.130
Joe Frank got himself
arrested again.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.049
We got to go bail him out.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.635
Hey, there are my pants. All right.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.303
People ain't got no sense.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.139
Boss, don't you touch
that hair! You'll mess it up!

06:29.223 --> 06:32.476
You be a real sweet, go grab me a beer?

06:32.559 --> 06:35.604
Now, I know you already
offered one to Mr. Dwayne.

06:38.524 --> 06:41.401
- Isn't she sweet?
- Just like her mama.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.028
I can't do it.

06:43.112 --> 06:45.155
Hey. What the hell?

06:45.239 --> 06:46.740
Why'd you say that?

06:46.824 --> 06:48.575
Now, now, now, now, now, now.

06:48.659 --> 06:50.994
Like this, boss.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.871
That's how it go.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.790
King of Beers. Clink it up.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.583
King of Beers.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.627
Mmm. Tell you what.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.963
You don't back down till you
reach them aliens, huh?

07:01.046 --> 07:02.131
Give me that.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.549
Maybe they can come down here

07:03.632 --> 07:05.217
and babysit or something.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.635
Sir, yes, sir.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.345
All right.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.805
Uh, all right, come on, Fluffy.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.515
Y'all have a good time.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.725
- Whoop!
- Dwayne, fall out!

07:24.153 --> 07:25.821
Miss Rayleen?

07:25.904 --> 07:27.531
Can you help me get
my flashlight brighter?

07:27.614 --> 07:29.616
You going up on that deck again?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.368
Mm, I don't know.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.704
Don't you have any girlfriends?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.956
- I got you.
- Uh-uh.

07:36.039 --> 07:38.333
I'm not a friend. I'm a grown-up.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.544
Then I guess nah.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.046
What about that little sparkly friend?

07:43.130 --> 07:46.341
His daddy's making him football-practice.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.760
God help that boy.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.429
Nobody at school?

07:50.512 --> 07:53.390
They all say I pee myself,
even though I don't.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.018
No. No, no, no, I know.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.399
What's that?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.401
It's a curler.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.195
What's it for?

08:06.278 --> 08:08.530
Make your eyelashes look longer.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.699
Weird.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.329
Miss Rayleen?

08:15.412 --> 08:17.581
You think I could be part alien?

08:19.416 --> 08:22.336
I worry about you, Christmas.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.548
Do you want to watch
The Outer Limits later?

08:26.632 --> 08:30.427
I'm sorry, boo, but I'm busy tonight.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.663
When Mama died, everyone said

08:57.746 --> 08:59.373
all kinds of different stuff.

08:59.456 --> 09:00.791
She's in Heaven.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.501
She's here with me but invisible.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.128
The boss man says
she got turned into stars

09:05.212 --> 09:08.507
and comets and meteors,
and I think that's what's true.

09:08.590 --> 09:12.636
I think she's stars
and comets and meteors.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.658
I would like to introduce

09:34.741 --> 09:38.412
this bill of sale as Defense Exhibit A.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.414
That's what I would do, too.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.499
...were involved
in something more frivolous.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.001
Well, there are those of us

09:44.084 --> 09:45.919
who still side with the establishment.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.921
Case dismissed.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.180
Go! Go, run, run, run!

09:57.264 --> 09:59.391
Hey, get them legs up! Get them legs up!

09:59.474 --> 10:01.393
Yeah! All right, now zigzag. Zigzag.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.770
Zigzag. Serpentine. Yeah!
They ain't gonna catch you

10:03.854 --> 10:05.480
if you serpentine. All right.

10:05.564 --> 10:06.857
Good hustle. All right.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.734
All right, now go long,
go long. Go, go, go.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.569
I want you to tell Joseph

10:10.652 --> 10:12.279
it gets better for people like us.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.614
For the ones with no mamas.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.700
Or the girl boys
and the falsely accused bed wetters.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.076
Hey! Hey.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.455
- But you might have to lie.
- That's all right.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.873
Come on, bring it back in.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.416
Bring it back in.
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.460
- Are we done yet?
- Give me the ball.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.086
All right, now, you got to be faster.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.297
- You have got to be fast.
- I don't need to be fast.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.007
- No, you're gonna be faster.
- Joseph.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.592
I've been watching you.

10:33.675 --> 10:36.595
You're gonna have to learn
to run fast as all hell.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.847
Right? All right. So go long.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.390
Set, hut!

10:40.474 --> 10:42.184
Okay, turn around.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.269

12:06.059 --> 12:09.146
She grew up right next door
to Miss Rayleen.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.440
She pretends she's better than everybody.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.776
Good afternoon, Birdies.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.612
Good afternoon, Miss Massey.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.781
Have we got a treat for you today.

12:19.865 --> 12:22.659
Who's excited for some Jamboree?

12:24.369 --> 12:25.996
Who's excited for some winning?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.248
And this year,

12:28.331 --> 12:30.834
I know we're gonna bring home
that trophy like always.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.878
Otherwise, y'all gonna be
staying in Marietta.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.421
I'm playing.

12:34.504 --> 12:35.547
I'm playing.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.215
So...

12:37.299 --> 12:39.968
there's something special
happening this year.

12:40.051 --> 12:45.515
An opportunity for all of us
to be a part of science.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.268
Hi. Hi, everybody.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.228
This is Doctor... Pers...

12:50.312 --> 12:51.730
- Persad.
- Persad.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.733
- All the way from NASA.
- Hello. Hello.

12:54.816 --> 12:58.778
Raise your hands if you like
to think about outer space.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.451
They're girls.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.119
That's okay, huh.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.330
You know, someone who loves to think

13:08.413 --> 13:10.707
about outer space is our president.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.251
- Oh, my.
- He has sent some of us

13:13.335 --> 13:15.212
on a mission across the Earth.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.756
We are putting together a record of life.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.216
A record?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.051
Yes. The Golden Record.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.761
The greatest hits of planet Earth.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.889
An account of all of us
to be launched into space.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.391
- Ooh.
- But I don't want to go to space.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.727
Hush up, precious. Shh, shh.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.438
We are recording people
from all over the world,

13:33.522 --> 13:35.482
giving greetings
in their native languages.

13:35.565 --> 13:39.027
If there is a chance there is other life,

13:39.110 --> 13:42.197
there is a chance someone will hear this.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.535
There's no such things as aliens, though.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.079
Piper, please.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.665
Don't interrupt.

13:51.748 --> 13:55.627
Our president is a humble man
from Georgia,

13:55.710 --> 13:59.839
so why not a little girl
from somewhere like...

13:59.923 --> 14:02.801
- Wiggly.
- ...somewhere like Wiggly

14:02.884 --> 14:05.220
be the keeper of our immortality?

14:05.303 --> 14:07.180
That's quite a job.

14:07.264 --> 14:08.598
Well, um, I appreciate your time.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.809
A group of us will be there
at the Jamboree.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.353
We are looking forward
to recording the winners.

14:13.436 --> 14:15.981
All right, let's go get changed
into our Jamboree costumes.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.693
Come on, get going!

14:19.776 --> 14:22.279
Let's bring home the gold
like we do, right?

14:22.362 --> 14:23.530
- Christmas!
- Ow!

14:23.613 --> 14:26.533
Why you always got to be
the one in the front, Piper?

14:26.616 --> 14:28.577
- I got more badges than you...
- Piper! Hold up!

14:28.660 --> 14:30.620
...so why don't you
pour yourself a big old glass

14:30.704 --> 14:32.622
- of hush up.
- Hey. Hey.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.957
Hey, Piper.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.875
Do y'all smell something?

14:35.959 --> 14:38.962
Did somebody pee on themselves?

14:40.505 --> 14:42.257
I want to be a Birdie Scout.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.551
I want to go to Jamboree.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.636
Go run into trees, bed wetter.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.680
- I'm not a bed wetter.
- Yes, huh.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.098
She'll get the uniform nasty.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.392
You'll get the uniform nasty.

14:54.102 --> 14:56.146
I just said that.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.815
I can be good for you.
I know stuff about space.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.317
I could help you win.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.736
Jamboree is a talent show.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.696
The best of the best.

15:04.779 --> 15:08.783
Is that you, or is trash you?

15:08.867 --> 15:11.786
Why y'all so mean to me?

15:11.870 --> 15:13.288
I don't know.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.041
Just feels right.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.543
I'm at the top, and you're at the bottom.

15:18.627 --> 15:21.713
It's just how we was made.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.591
Go, go, go.

15:24.674 --> 15:25.842
Open the locker!

15:25.925 --> 15:28.261
Does this mean I'm in?

15:32.098 --> 15:34.601
Ain't that some shit.

15:40.065 --> 15:42.233
Greetings from planet Earth.

15:42.317 --> 15:46.321
I am Krystal Massey.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.533
And, um...

15:57.624 --> 15:59.250
There we go.

16:05.882 --> 16:09.260
And I wish you great tidings
and great joy.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.137
I do.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.139
Aliens out there.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.732
Hello!

16:22.816 --> 16:25.151
Anyone?

16:26.528 --> 16:29.072
Oh, look, it's Christmas.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.991
Bless your heart.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.744
I'm gonna tell you something, precious.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.247
When we get put in a locker, it's because,

16:37.330 --> 16:41.126
one way or the other,
we got ourselves in there.

16:41.209 --> 16:44.045
- You understand?
- No.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.797
Oh, Christmas Flint.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.800
We just don't know about you, do we?

16:48.883 --> 16:52.387
You're sweet, but we just don't know.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.308
Christmas!

16:57.392 --> 16:58.560
Hey.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.478
Oh, my God, I love your hair.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.771
It's so different.

17:01.855 --> 17:02.981
- Yeah.
- It's abstract.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.607
You're abstract.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.776
I want our band name to be Gemini.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.778
We can dress in that shiny plastic.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.446
Shiny plastic?

17:12.741 --> 17:15.326
What the hell happened to your hair?

17:15.410 --> 17:16.493
Fell off, I guess.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.204
You look ferocious, boss.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.789
Nothing more important than that.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.040
She didn't do this herself.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.126
- Who did this?
- No one.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.420
Just tell her she looks nice.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.172
What's wrong with y'all?

17:27.255 --> 17:29.507
Why's she letting people cut on her hair?

17:29.591 --> 17:31.801
She ain't letting nobody do nothing.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.554
- Clarification, boss.
- Overruled!

17:34.637 --> 17:36.347
Yep.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.433
That'd be the judge.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.352
You tell him I'm on my way, all right?

17:41.436 --> 17:43.271
Oh. Come on, Fluffy.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.315
Can you make sure
she got something to eat?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.442
I ain't got time for no children!

17:47.525 --> 17:49.527
- And I ain't her mama.
- Come on there, boss.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.446
There you go, Fluffy.

19:33.548 --> 19:35.133
that says you have to be. I checked.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.177
We need a dance for Jamboree
so we can win.

19:38.261 --> 19:40.388
You're over your limit.
You can only get one more.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.654
Hey. If I make that dance,

19:56.738 --> 19:58.072

20:48.373 --> 20:50.875
- Sorry.
- Do you want to help

20:50.959 --> 20:53.211
the most poorest,
struggling fools of the Earth?

20:53.294 --> 20:55.630
We're gonna leave a message
for the aliens.

20:55.713 --> 20:58.132
Let me ask.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.552
Dear Lord Jesus,

21:01.636 --> 21:04.305
um, do you think this is a good idea?

21:04.389 --> 21:05.848
Amen.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.684
Yes!

21:14.357 --> 21:15.984
The Birdie manual says

21:16.067 --> 21:19.404
we need girls with grace
and virtue to lead us to glory.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.740
But I think we need Hell-No Price.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.242
Papa gave it to me.

21:24.325 --> 21:26.995
Bubblegum. My favorite.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.955
Hell-No Price.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.624
I made you an avocado sandwich.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.211
What the hell is this?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.422
It's God's way of saying "mayonnaise."

21:37.505 --> 21:39.507
Get that nasty away from me.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.634
Heads up, bed wetter.
We're coming for you.

21:45.888 --> 21:47.056
Let me help you.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.433
No, get away from me. I'm fine.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.059
That was real nice of you.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.436
I ain't doing this 'cause I'm nice.

21:51.519 --> 21:52.645
Just like to fight.

21:52.729 --> 21:53.980
Using you as bait.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.232
Now, go away.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.819
I started
a Birdie Scouting troop.

21:59.902 --> 22:02.113
You're fast, and you're smarter
than everybody.

22:02.196 --> 22:04.032
You could help us and be invaluable.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.533
I don't need to be invaluable.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.201
Oh, don't you want a chance

22:07.285 --> 22:09.829
to leave a message
for the aliens in the future?

22:09.912 --> 22:11.581
Or at least earn some badges?

22:11.664 --> 22:13.583
- Hell no.
- But there's a record

22:13.666 --> 22:16.085
they funna send into space.

22:18.463 --> 22:19.922
Smash is like the universe.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.466
Easy, Smash. Go play.

22:21.549 --> 22:23.176
Full of gas and mystery.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.182
Hell-No...

22:29.265 --> 22:31.684
you...

22:31.768 --> 22:33.936
you're like a human volcano.

22:34.020 --> 22:38.733
I see you walking around,
fixin' to explode all the time.

22:38.816 --> 22:42.278
I always wonder,
what that girl think about?

22:42.361 --> 22:45.198
So, what do you think about?

22:45.281 --> 22:47.784
Blowing everything to kingdom come.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.788
How we're all headed for the boneyard,

22:51.871 --> 22:53.498
so what's the difference.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.168
Burning everything down

22:57.251 --> 22:59.212
so I don't have to look at nothing pretty,

22:59.295 --> 23:01.380
'cause none of that for me.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.093
Well...

23:07.220 --> 23:09.847
By us standing together and saying,

23:09.931 --> 23:12.308
"We should be here forever,"

23:12.391 --> 23:14.936
and winning it over them,

23:15.019 --> 23:17.021
that's burning their whole nasty operation

23:17.105 --> 23:18.648
right to the ground.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.985
Yeah.

23:23.069 --> 23:26.030
- Hmm? Hmm?
- Not right now, Smash.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.325
Smash gets to come, too.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.119
All right.

23:31.202 --> 23:34.205
Smash get all the cookies she wants.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.040
Okay.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.583
You know I ain't your friend, right?

23:37.667 --> 23:40.753
Yeah, I know that.

23:41.796 --> 23:43.422
Good.

23:45.258 --> 23:46.342
Birdie manual says

23:46.425 --> 23:48.136
every troop needs a Troop Mother

23:48.219 --> 23:50.805
who will show us how to be
shining examples of womanhood.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.473
Ow!

23:53.724 --> 23:56.602
Whatever that means.

23:56.686 --> 24:00.022
My client could not have been
present the night in question,

24:00.106 --> 24:03.192
because we have receipts from Winn-Dixie

24:03.276 --> 24:06.028
that prove he spent the night shopping.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.447
He was shopping for
lighter fluid for 20 minutes.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.950
It's right here on the receipt.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.493
Dang.

24:12.577 --> 24:15.204
I swear, you men and arson.

24:15.288 --> 24:17.415
Why you feel like
you have to set things on fire

24:17.498 --> 24:18.791
every time you have a problem?

24:18.875 --> 24:20.543
That's our way.

24:20.626 --> 24:24.046
Life comes at you hard,
you set it the hell on fire.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.923
Ain't that right, boss?

24:26.007 --> 24:27.550
- Miss Rayleen?
- Yeah?

24:27.633 --> 24:30.344
- I need something.
- Welcome to life, sugar booger.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.599
Will you lead us to glory?

24:34.682 --> 24:37.143
Hell no.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.644
Prize is you get to leave a message

24:38.728 --> 24:40.229
for the aliens on the Golden Record,

24:40.313 --> 24:42.815
- with Mozart and them.
- What?

24:42.899 --> 24:44.150
Now, ho-hold up, hold up.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.318
I'd be the representative of

24:45.401 --> 24:47.236
all the children on planet Earth.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.614
So, like, our music for aliens?

24:49.697 --> 24:51.282
- Some of our music.
- Johnny Cash?

24:51.365 --> 24:52.491
No.

24:52.575 --> 24:53.492
- Waylon?
- No.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.203
Gram Parsons? Rolling Stones?

24:55.286 --> 24:57.205
No, more like Beethoven and them.

24:57.288 --> 24:59.332
Well, then I'm not interested in space.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.375
I don't care for that at all.

25:01.459 --> 25:02.877
Yeah, well, I care.

25:04.420 --> 25:05.922
There's some other life out there,

25:06.005 --> 25:08.132
and they funna know me.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.726
No.

25:18.809 --> 25:21.229
- It-it'd be office hours.
- You already owe me back pay.

25:21.312 --> 25:22.939
Well, I'll get it. I'll get it.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.483
I mean, ain't my fault everybody guilty.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.526
Ain't my fault you can't
get people to pay you.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.528
Joseph already started
our choreography, though.

25:29.612 --> 25:30.696
No. No, sir.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.990
I don't get on good with little girls.

25:33.074 --> 25:36.452
I do arsonists, murderers
and state prosecutors.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.703
Little girls give me the creeps.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.288
Plus, you can't hit 'em no more.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.581
They changed the laws.

25:40.665 --> 25:42.333
All right.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.669
"Lead us to glory." I like that.

25:44.752 --> 25:45.962
And it would've been good

25:46.045 --> 25:47.838
for you to be around other girls, boss.

25:47.922 --> 25:51.133
Lord knows I raise you like one
of them hillbillies next door.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.220
You'll be doing dip
if I don't take some action.

25:55.638 --> 25:59.058
Miss Rayleen, take your
office days down to two.

25:59.141 --> 26:00.434
No. Hell no.

26:00.518 --> 26:01.727
I'm the boss man.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.396
You the leader of the Birdies.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.897
Me and Fluffy,

26:04.981 --> 26:07.984
we gonna go and try and get paid.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.196
Here you go.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.450
Fall out, Fluffy.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.625
I don't do nothing half-ass.

26:24.709 --> 26:26.752
I don't want to do anything
with half an ass.

26:26.836 --> 26:28.129
You know you're just setting yourself up

26:28.212 --> 26:30.256
for your little heart to get broke.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.758
No, setting myself up
to change my whole life.

26:37.388 --> 26:39.515
He forgot to open
the damn beer can.

26:43.394 --> 26:44.520
Mmm!

26:49.608 --> 26:51.694
Rayleen Mosely?

26:51.777 --> 26:53.070
Hi, Krystal.

26:53.154 --> 26:54.572
Hey.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.824
It's been a minute.

26:56.907 --> 26:59.660
Mm-hmm.

26:59.744 --> 27:02.288
Since, uh...

27:02.371 --> 27:05.124
Pavo Possum Fest.

27:05.207 --> 27:08.794
Well, hey. Sure is nice to see you.

27:10.046 --> 27:13.382
And are you a... are you a mama?

27:14.383 --> 27:16.177
I'm the Troop Mama.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.641
Yeah.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.477
For real?

27:24.560 --> 27:27.313
- Are you playing?
- I don't play. You know that.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.648
They can't be Birdies.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.275
- Why not?
- Because these children

27:31.359 --> 27:32.693
are not...

27:32.777 --> 27:35.738
Because Birdies have
a strict quality code.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.365
My boos are quality.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.414
And you think you can get these children

27:45.498 --> 27:46.916
to follow these standards?

27:46.999 --> 27:49.877
Does a fat puppy poot? I got this.

27:49.960 --> 27:53.089
That kind of language isn't necessary.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.924
All right, then.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.967
Got to give you a number.

27:57.051 --> 27:58.719
Troop...

27:58.803 --> 28:00.805
Oh, dear, well...

28:00.888 --> 28:05.643
Huh. The only number left in
the state of Georgia is zero.

28:05.726 --> 28:07.311
Isn't that sweet?

28:07.395 --> 28:08.938
Perfectly appropriate.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.314
Yes, precious.

28:10.398 --> 28:12.733
Zero's the number of infinity.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.277
Is that right?

28:15.361 --> 28:17.571
- Yeah.
- Well...

28:17.655 --> 28:21.409
Troop Zero, welcome to Birdie Scouting.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.163
I don't know if you thought
this was gonna be easy.

28:26.247 --> 28:30.042
Being a woman of substance is never easy.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.752
It's not pageantry,

28:31.836 --> 28:34.130
where you look pretty for the boys.

28:34.213 --> 28:38.717
It's not 4-H, where you birth
a calf and call it a day.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.220
Before you're taking care of your babies,

28:41.303 --> 28:43.639
before you're
taking care of your husbands,

28:43.722 --> 28:46.142
your old parents and whoever
else needs you to hold them up,

28:46.225 --> 28:47.768
you're taking care of your troop.

28:47.852 --> 28:51.105
You're making sure you're all winners.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.649
Each member is required to earn one badge.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.695
That's the bare minimum
to qualify for Jamboree.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.238
You will earn them honestly...

28:59.321 --> 29:02.575
no cheating... and if you earn 'em,

29:02.658 --> 29:04.368
then you got a shot at Marietta.

29:04.452 --> 29:08.539
So, welcome, Troop Zero.

29:08.622 --> 29:10.749
We'll see you on the other side.

29:10.833 --> 29:12.543
If you make it out alive.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.547
I'm playing. I'm playing.

29:16.630 --> 29:18.716
I'm not.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.176
Come on, y'all.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.927
Come on. Don't take nothing.

29:22.011 --> 29:23.512
She'll say you got it dirty.

29:34.231 --> 29:37.193
- I will destroy you!
- Stop it! Stop it!

29:37.276 --> 29:39.737
All right, all right.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.780
Ow.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.824
Y'all want to do this.

29:43.908 --> 29:46.702
Hey, hey.

29:52.750 --> 29:56.337
- Y'all my Birdies now.
- He can't be a Birdie.

29:56.420 --> 29:58.214
Can't be a Birdie 'cause he's half boy.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.507
Can't be a football player
'cause he's half girl.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.509
No, ma'am, that would be a "no, ma'am."

30:01.592 --> 30:02.718
We are sweet to each other.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.136
Smash, get your finger out your nose.

30:04.220 --> 30:05.930
Get the straw out of your mouth.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.348
Hell-No, you get the straw
out of your mouth, too.

30:07.431 --> 30:09.016
Put your foot down.

30:09.099 --> 30:12.686
Joseph, welcome to the Birdie Scouts.

30:13.687 --> 30:16.232
Smash, I don't care about the law.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.317
Rayleen funna whup your ass.

30:21.028 --> 30:24.156
Joseph is one of y'all now, all right?

30:24.240 --> 30:26.784
And we are gonna do the best we can.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.202
- Yeah.
- Nah.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.370
We funna lose.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.829
This a bunch of losers and trash

30:30.913 --> 30:32.122
- nobody wants.
- No.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.916
We funna win.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.168
Here we are.

30:36.252 --> 30:38.963
Leftovers for the leftovers.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.966
I'm playing. Y'all know I am.

30:42.049 --> 30:43.842
For real.

30:43.926 --> 30:46.428
Good luck with whatever
you find in this badge jar.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.514
My girls have won almost every one.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.224
Can you believe it?

30:50.307 --> 30:53.310
I'm sure there's something
in there for you.

30:53.394 --> 30:54.812
I appreciate you.

30:54.895 --> 30:57.481
- Mm.
- And let's see what we got here.

30:57.565 --> 30:58.857
What's that?

30:58.941 --> 31:00.359
Dang, these are ugly.

31:00.442 --> 31:01.652
Take it.

31:03.404 --> 31:04.530
What the hell is this?

31:04.613 --> 31:06.949
Oh, that's Survival in the Wilderness.

31:07.032 --> 31:09.493
Can we have something
more in their ballpark?

31:09.577 --> 31:12.830
I mean, "Dress-idge,"
that ain't gonna work.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.082
"Dressage" is the correct pronunciation.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.542
Whatever it is, it ain't gonna work.

31:16.625 --> 31:19.044
- Ceramics. Table Settings?
- Hell-No.

31:19.128 --> 31:21.255
- No.
- Just remind me,

31:21.338 --> 31:24.049
what do they say about beggars again?

31:25.134 --> 31:28.178
I'm playing. I'm playing.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.807
Y'all clean up this mess in here.

31:33.976 --> 31:35.561
- These smell.
- Mm!

31:35.644 --> 31:37.813
All right.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.441
All y'all got to do is win one badge each

31:40.524 --> 31:42.234
to go to Jamboree.

31:42.318 --> 31:43.694
So, it shouldn't be that hard.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.947
Have y'all ever won
anything in your lives?

31:52.620 --> 31:54.246
All right, Troop Zero, let's just...

31:54.330 --> 31:56.749
You know what? Let's just do what we can.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.793
You too thick, wear the sash.

31:59.877 --> 32:03.130
You don't want to wear
girl clothes, wear the sash.

32:03.213 --> 32:04.757
You pee your pants, wear the sash.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.468
- Just don't get any pee on it.
- I don't pee myself.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.178
Yeah, that's just
in principle. Here.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.471
Well, come on, now, Hell-No.

32:10.554 --> 32:11.972
Come on. Even if y'all don't win,

32:12.056 --> 32:13.724
you got to show them that you're serious.

32:13.807 --> 32:15.726
- Y'all serious?
- Yes, ma'am.

32:15.809 --> 32:17.102
All right.

32:17.186 --> 32:19.063
Let's get this, my boos.

32:20.898 --> 32:23.776
Cookie Selling badge.

32:23.859 --> 32:26.236

35:46.436 --> 35:47.938

36:32.274 --> 36:34.860

36:34.943 --> 36:36.945
Shouldn't have taken them.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.947
They're ruining everything.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.743
They're even bigger losers than I am.

36:45.037 --> 36:47.623
Oh, you're right.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.751
Better for you to be back
at home watching Outer Limits

36:50.834 --> 36:54.880
and me to be living my life in peace.

36:54.963 --> 36:56.965
What? No.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.803

37:20.822 --> 37:22.699
Beauty badge

37:22.783 --> 37:24.660
If he can make my hair less ugly,

37:24.743 --> 37:26.703
he can make the world less ugly.

37:26.787 --> 37:28.830
This is the time to say yes.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.165
This is how I am.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.125
This is what God gave me to work with.

37:32.209 --> 37:35.045
And I'm gonna make it beautiful

Got some inspiring words, Mr. Ramsey?

38:59.796 --> 39:02.758
- Thank you, Miss Rayleen.
- Yeah.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.469
When I was in
the United States Army

39:05.552 --> 39:07.179
with Mr. Dwayne,

39:07.262 --> 39:10.348
we used to run a course
like this twice a day.

39:10.432 --> 39:12.934
And there were machine guns
going off over our heads.

39:13.018 --> 39:15.896
We had bowls of rice
just once a day

39:15.979 --> 39:17.147
just to get us through the hardships.

39:17.230 --> 39:18.940
Not about the rice right now.

39:19.024 --> 39:23.236
What Mr. Dwayne is saying
is life ain't about winning.

39:23.320 --> 39:25.489
I mean, it is for some...
for those who win.

39:25.572 --> 39:28.200
But for the rest of y'all...

39:28.283 --> 39:30.368
the trick is to endure.

39:30.452 --> 39:34.372
Not let the kicks and the nasty words

39:34.456 --> 39:35.624
keep you down.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.043
Then you wake up one day,

39:38.126 --> 39:41.296
and you'll be the last one standing.

39:43.256 --> 39:44.716
So...

39:48.303 --> 39:50.347
Go get them Endurance badges, little boos!

39:50.430 --> 39:52.641
Go! Come on.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.602
Smash, pick up those feet.

39:55.685 --> 39:58.563
Pick up your feet!

40:00.482 --> 40:02.317
You go easy on my girl.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.029
All right? You-you know she got
one leg shorter than the other?

40:06.113 --> 40:07.447
Ow!

40:07.531 --> 40:08.740
That poor thing can't afford

40:08.824 --> 40:10.450
to do nothing easy, and you know that.

40:10.534 --> 40:12.619
- Come on!
- Come on, y'all.

40:12.702 --> 40:15.330
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

40:16.957 --> 40:20.335
This badge was made
for Hell-No Price.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.797
She eats obstacles for
breakfast, lunch and dinner.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.007
Hell-No! Hell-No!

40:26.091 --> 40:28.093
Hell-No!

40:28.176 --> 40:30.720
You done good, Hell-No.

40:41.815 --> 40:43.900
Smash, I figure you take things apart,

40:43.984 --> 40:47.154
you might be able
to put 'em back together.

40:47.237 --> 40:48.321
Go on.

41:14.764 --> 41:15.932
My boo!

41:22.439 --> 41:24.441
That Smash will surprise you.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.610
And I will, too.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.111
Promise.

41:28.195 --> 41:31.114
Got to have one special skill.

41:31.198 --> 41:33.742
This is almost impossible to mess up.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.619
Even for you, Christmas.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.162
Baking badge.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.998
Bake a cake, get the badge.

41:40.081 --> 41:42.500
Can't you just give me one?

41:42.584 --> 41:46.004
- Are you a cheater?
- No, ma'am.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.215
Oh, forgot the dang vanilla.

41:53.637 --> 41:55.180
What the "H" y'all doing?

41:56.681 --> 41:57.974
Baking badge.

41:58.058 --> 41:59.392
Why are y'all playing like this?

41:59.476 --> 42:02.812
Yeah, y'all suck at being girls.

42:02.896 --> 42:05.815
- Y'all suck at being girls.
- Yeah.

42:05.899 --> 42:07.901
- Why does she always do that to me?
- It's okay.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.277
You...

42:09.361 --> 42:12.197
you ain't even got no eye.

42:13.865 --> 42:14.866
And you...

42:14.950 --> 42:18.286
you ain't even a real girl.

42:18.370 --> 42:19.704
All of y'all.

42:19.788 --> 42:21.289
I don't get y'all.

42:21.373 --> 42:23.500
How do any of y'all even get out of bed,

42:23.583 --> 42:25.877
being so weird?

42:25.961 --> 42:27.837
Shut up.

42:31.424 --> 42:34.135
What'd you say, girl boy?

42:35.262 --> 42:37.889
I said, "Shut up."

42:37.973 --> 42:40.141
And my name's Joseph.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.894
Call me Joseph like a normal person.

42:42.978 --> 42:45.563
You're not a normal person.

42:45.647 --> 42:47.148
Don't talk about him like that.

42:47.232 --> 42:48.566
Be sweet, Hell-No.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.444
We're just doing our badge.

42:51.528 --> 42:53.530
He didn't mean any harm.

42:53.613 --> 42:54.698
He ours.

42:54.781 --> 42:56.533
He our fellow Birdie Scout.

42:56.616 --> 42:57.993
He's a freak.

42:58.076 --> 42:59.995
No, you are.

43:01.621 --> 43:03.039
Just let her say what she wants.

43:03.123 --> 43:04.708
Don't matter.

43:04.791 --> 43:07.335
I need this badge, though.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.340
It does too matter.

43:12.424 --> 43:13.842
We funna win.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.969
We funna get on that record.

43:17.971 --> 43:20.807
You're just one piece of dirt
on a bigger piece of dirt.

43:20.890 --> 43:24.311
We're gonna last forever,

43:24.394 --> 43:26.730
and you're just gonna wash away.

43:37.282 --> 43:39.284
Oh, hell no.

43:42.871 --> 43:44.914
Let's get 'em!

44:01.473 --> 44:04.017
Flour!

44:17.739 --> 44:20.700
Stop!

44:37.050 --> 44:39.719
Act right, y'all! Act right!

44:39.803 --> 44:41.846
Holy mother...

44:41.930 --> 44:44.307
Piper, stop!

44:44.391 --> 44:46.017
Stop! You are sweet.

44:46.101 --> 44:47.727
You are sweet!

44:47.811 --> 44:49.896
Where are my young ladies?

44:49.979 --> 44:51.231
Right here.

44:53.942 --> 44:55.652
I have never seen

44:55.735 --> 45:00.281
such delinquency, such a lack of hygiene.

45:00.365 --> 45:03.952
Oh, the trash, the trash of it all!

45:04.035 --> 45:06.830
And y'all... y'all were raised better.

45:06.913 --> 45:09.249
Troop Zero...

45:10.834 --> 45:12.752
...you were so close.

45:12.836 --> 45:15.588
You blazed through
all the badges on your level.

45:15.672 --> 45:16.923
They sure in hell did.

45:17.006 --> 45:19.134
- They're sorry.
- I ain't sorry.

45:19.217 --> 45:22.387
Starting fights, acting ugly.

45:22.470 --> 45:24.639
Y'all suspended.

45:26.474 --> 45:28.476
Oh, come on.

45:28.560 --> 45:31.438
Can't I just use the cafeteria
to get my Baking badge?

45:31.521 --> 45:33.898
No, ma'am. No.

45:33.982 --> 45:36.276
I can't even pretend
y'all are cute anymore.

45:36.359 --> 45:37.652
It's sad.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.821
Sad, sad, sad.

45:39.904 --> 45:42.532
And, my troop, y'all are on thin ice.

45:42.615 --> 45:44.576
Let's go. Get on out.

45:44.659 --> 45:46.494
Piper. Come on, get.

45:48.329 --> 45:49.873
And y'all clean this mess up.

46:00.758 --> 46:03.136
- Family special.
- Coming right up.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.770
Think y'all would be happier just doing...

46:12.854 --> 46:17.567
I don't know... Bible school
or FFA or just watching TV.

46:19.235 --> 46:21.571
Whatever happened to watching TV?

46:21.654 --> 46:23.823
I can't give up.

46:23.907 --> 46:26.534
I mean, there must be
one badge I can earn.

46:26.618 --> 46:28.745
If y'all even get to Jamboree,

46:28.828 --> 46:32.081
which you won't, y'all ain't gonna win.

46:32.165 --> 46:34.709
I mean, I'm sorry, but...

46:34.792 --> 46:37.504
I wish someone had told me that.

46:37.587 --> 46:39.297
No Jamboree?

46:39.380 --> 46:41.925
I made a dance, though.

46:42.008 --> 46:43.718
I really want to tell y'all
what you want to hear,

46:43.801 --> 46:46.095
but this situation just ain't salvageable.

46:49.891 --> 46:51.184
Could've been gone from here.

46:51.267 --> 46:52.852
I could've been famous.

46:52.936 --> 46:55.271
I wanted to leave a permanent record.

46:55.355 --> 46:57.732
We still can.

47:02.946 --> 47:04.155
Smash!

47:04.239 --> 47:05.281
Quit it!

47:05.365 --> 47:06.616
Smash, come back.

47:06.699 --> 47:08.826
Calm down.

47:10.286 --> 47:11.329
Smash, come back!

47:11.412 --> 47:12.455
- No, come on!
- Come on, Smash.

47:12.539 --> 47:13.790
This ain't us.

47:13.873 --> 47:15.500
This is some candy-ass,

47:15.583 --> 47:17.627
B-grade version of us
'cause we ain't got nobody

47:17.710 --> 47:19.504
- to show us how to be better.
- Hey!

47:19.587 --> 47:21.548
Show us.

47:21.631 --> 47:24.467
Be that one for us, please.

47:24.551 --> 47:25.802
No one was that for me.

47:25.885 --> 47:27.595
Yeah, well, it can be different now.

47:27.679 --> 47:29.472
It's never gonna be different.

47:29.556 --> 47:32.141
Your life is gonna be the same
as you are right now.

47:32.225 --> 47:34.143
The sooner you learn that, the better.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.400
That can't be true.

47:40.483 --> 47:42.151
'Cause I'll die.

47:44.571 --> 47:46.197
You were running after her

47:46.281 --> 47:47.574
- just the same.
- That doesn't mean

47:47.657 --> 47:49.117
you can yell at her like that.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.618
Will y'all help me
with this window?

47:51.953 --> 47:55.206
Sit down! Sit down.

47:57.375 --> 47:58.918
Okay?

47:59.002 --> 48:01.087
One badge. One more badge.

48:01.170 --> 48:03.047
Uh-uh. Give me that.

48:10.305 --> 48:13.474
Surviving in the Wilderness.

48:15.143 --> 48:17.020
Like Jesus.

48:30.491 --> 48:31.784
Enjoy your suspension.

48:31.868 --> 48:33.870
Ow!

48:33.953 --> 48:36.205
- Wow.
- Stay down, bed wetter.

48:36.289 --> 48:38.166
We do not stay down

48:38.249 --> 48:39.417
because they tell us to, Christmas.

48:39.500 --> 48:41.085
That is a "no, ma'am."

48:43.963 --> 48:47.467
- Smash get a snack break?
- Hunger is good for you.

48:47.550 --> 48:50.053
You starving us. You putting us in danger.

48:50.136 --> 48:52.680
Y'all in danger every day.

49:00.855 --> 49:03.232
We ain't going into
the South Woods, are we?

49:03.316 --> 49:06.235
It's time y'all learned
to take it by the horns.

49:10.156 --> 49:11.407
Smash, wait up.

49:11.491 --> 49:12.909
Smash.

49:12.992 --> 49:14.952
I heard someone died in there.

49:22.418 --> 49:24.462
Don't touch nothing.

49:29.676 --> 49:32.136
What was that? I'm ascared.

49:32.220 --> 49:34.263
Will it be fast when I die?

49:34.347 --> 49:35.807
Y'all get ahold of y'all selves.

49:46.192 --> 49:47.652
Go. Go.

49:51.906 --> 49:53.741
And it's really cool

49:53.825 --> 49:55.952
because the aliens, th-they'll hear us

49:56.035 --> 49:57.370
because the sound waves,

49:57.453 --> 49:59.288
they go out, out, out into the universe

49:59.372 --> 50:00.415
until they hit something, then...

50:00.498 --> 50:02.166
That is not how it works.

50:02.250 --> 50:03.543
Yeah, it is. My mama said.

50:03.626 --> 50:04.877
All right, now, y'all.

50:06.921 --> 50:07.964
We sleeping here?

50:08.047 --> 50:09.841
I'm not gonna sleep with Christmas.

50:09.924 --> 50:11.092
She funna pee on me.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.010
- I don't wet the bed.
- Yes-huh.

50:13.094 --> 50:14.721
Y'all stop acting ugly.

50:14.804 --> 50:16.639
Smash.

50:16.723 --> 50:17.890
All right, my boos.

50:17.974 --> 50:20.435
It's time y'all earned
that badge fair and square.

50:20.518 --> 50:21.978
You leaving us?

50:22.061 --> 50:23.855
We funna die.

50:23.938 --> 50:25.314
Ah, hell, hell no, I can't stay...

50:25.398 --> 50:27.400
Hell yes, Hell-No.

50:27.483 --> 50:29.402
And when y'all wake up
in the morning, y'all know that

50:29.485 --> 50:30.695
you spent the night in the wilderness,

50:30.778 --> 50:32.071
didn't no one help you.

50:32.155 --> 50:33.990
What if we don't...

50:34.073 --> 50:35.491
All right, prove 'em wrong.

50:35.575 --> 50:36.909
Make me proud.

50:36.993 --> 50:39.537
But what if we don't wake up?

50:57.472 --> 50:58.639
Yea, though I walk through

50:58.723 --> 51:00.099
the valley of the shadow of death...

51:01.601 --> 51:04.729
...I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me...

51:23.623 --> 51:26.292
It's rockin' WZPZ Rock.

51:26.375 --> 51:29.170
Coming up, David Bowie's "Rebel Rebel."

51:32.840 --> 51:35.426

52:32.692 --> 52:34.986
Is our signal stronger?

52:35.069 --> 52:36.571
I think it is.

52:42.034 --> 52:44.078
- Oh, Smash.
- Smash.

52:46.581 --> 52:48.416
If there is wild animals,

52:48.499 --> 52:51.294
I funna spit scuppernong seeds
in their eyes and blind them.

52:51.377 --> 52:53.588
And then... then they'll
run off and be scared.

52:53.671 --> 52:55.840
They'll be the ones who's scared.

52:55.923 --> 52:58.843
'Cause I'm not scared. I'm not scared.

53:04.557 --> 53:06.893
Hell-No.

53:06.976 --> 53:09.770
You're out of the circle of protection.

53:09.854 --> 53:11.314
I don't need it.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.773
- Yes, you do.
- Nuh-uh.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.442
- Yes-huh.
- Nuh-uh.

53:14.525 --> 53:16.319
It's fixin' to be a meteor shower.

53:16.402 --> 53:20.197
Just... just go over there
and look for it.

53:20.281 --> 53:23.910
I'm responsible for you
not getting ate in the wilderness.

53:23.993 --> 53:26.579
Now, come sleep with the rest of us.

53:27.830 --> 53:29.165
I can't.

53:29.248 --> 53:31.417
- Why not?
- Because.

53:33.419 --> 53:36.589
And it's not true
that I wet the bed, but...

53:38.591 --> 53:40.426
...if I did,

53:40.509 --> 53:43.971
maybe, whenever I get
emotional or nervous,

53:44.055 --> 53:46.807
and maybe that's when I'd pee on stuff.

53:46.891 --> 53:49.143
If I did, I wouldn't know why.

53:51.812 --> 53:54.899
I used to wet the bed.

53:54.982 --> 53:57.234
Really?

53:57.318 --> 53:59.278
Nah.

54:01.113 --> 54:03.449
But if I did, I'd be shamed.

54:03.532 --> 54:05.242
How come you pee the bed?

54:05.326 --> 54:08.162
- Can't help it?
- I don't.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.081
Okay.

54:14.210 --> 54:18.089
But maybe if I did...

54:18.172 --> 54:20.508
time was right after my mama's death,

54:20.591 --> 54:22.593
and then I couldn't stop.

54:25.137 --> 54:29.016
And so, you-you can just go, you know.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.602
I leave, and you die
all alone in the wild,

54:31.686 --> 54:33.187
covered in your own pee,

54:33.270 --> 54:34.855
and you'll miss every meteor shower

54:34.939 --> 54:37.191
that will ever happen
the whole rest of your life

54:37.274 --> 54:39.193
'cause you be dead.

54:39.276 --> 54:42.697
I'm gonna tell you some scary
stories to keep you awake.

54:42.780 --> 54:46.117
- Please don't.
- Too late.

54:46.200 --> 54:49.370
One night, in the pouring rain,

54:49.453 --> 54:53.207
a girl hears on the radio,
"Lock the doors.

54:53.290 --> 54:55.668
There's a maniac!"

54:55.751 --> 54:58.421
And all that was left of her...

54:58.504 --> 55:00.840
was her hand,

55:00.923 --> 55:04.427
scratching at the door.

55:05.970 --> 55:09.640
And when she came out,
she never spoke again,

55:09.724 --> 55:13.978
and her hair was bright white.

55:14.061 --> 55:16.814
- Bright white?
- Yeah.

55:23.154 --> 55:25.781
Christmas. Christmas.

55:25.865 --> 55:27.783
- What do you want?
- Get up.

55:27.867 --> 55:29.368
Get up now. Now.

55:29.452 --> 55:30.870
Look.

55:49.221 --> 55:51.223
Think they might have been peacemakers

55:51.307 --> 55:53.142
sent from-from the giant caterpillar?

55:53.225 --> 55:54.393
Ah, something bit me.

55:54.477 --> 55:55.561
There is no giant caterpillar.

55:55.644 --> 55:56.812
- Yeah, there is.
- Yeah, there is.

55:56.896 --> 55:57.938
No, there isn't.

55:58.022 --> 55:59.106
How do y'all believe in that?

55:59.190 --> 56:00.357
Look what I found.

56:00.441 --> 56:02.526
I brought scuppernongs.

56:02.610 --> 56:04.361
- Hmm?
- Okay.

56:04.445 --> 56:05.905
I want one.

56:05.988 --> 56:08.115
- Three.
- Don't take all of them, now.

56:08.199 --> 56:10.201
Give me some.

56:10.284 --> 56:11.911
Mm-hmm.

56:14.663 --> 56:17.500
Anyone comes for you again,
I'm gonna beat their ass

56:17.583 --> 56:20.503
back to their gosh damn swamp shack.

56:20.586 --> 56:23.297
Just come at them
with hair like that.

56:27.384 --> 56:29.762
My boos! Y'all did it!

56:29.845 --> 56:31.722
Come on, get up.

56:31.806 --> 56:33.599
You done it, Christmas.

56:33.682 --> 56:35.768
There you go.

56:35.851 --> 56:38.354
We funna go to Jamboree!

56:38.437 --> 56:40.064
Yes, ma'am.

56:44.276 --> 56:46.403
We got it, Miss Massey.

56:46.487 --> 56:48.405
We're gonna go to Jamboree.

56:48.489 --> 56:49.698
Praise the living Jesus.

56:49.782 --> 56:51.700
And we funna win, too.

56:51.784 --> 56:52.910
We funna dance.

56:52.993 --> 56:54.620
Me and Christmas
made a dance that's amazing.

56:54.703 --> 56:57.373
Y'all have a lot to be proud of.

56:57.456 --> 56:58.958
Y'all do. I'm not even playing.

56:59.041 --> 57:00.167
We're gonna go.

57:00.251 --> 57:01.836
- We are.
- We're going.

57:03.129 --> 57:05.756
Oh, precious.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.633
You're not.

57:08.843 --> 57:10.261
We are.

57:10.344 --> 57:12.596
They don't have a legitimate troop leader.

57:12.680 --> 57:14.557
It's so, so sad,

57:14.640 --> 57:16.642
but what I discovered last night

57:16.725 --> 57:19.270
when I consulted statute 12,

57:19.353 --> 57:21.897
section eight of the Birdie Scout Code...

57:21.981 --> 57:24.191
Here it is.

57:24.275 --> 57:27.153
Troop Mothers must not have
any prior arrests.

57:27.236 --> 57:29.738
And, Miss Rayleen, don't you have one?

57:29.822 --> 57:31.448
- No convictions.
- For an incident

57:31.532 --> 57:32.867
in which a gentleman's tires were slashed,

57:32.950 --> 57:34.493
his trailer broken into,

57:34.577 --> 57:36.328
and all his mounted deer heads
spray-painted pink.

57:36.412 --> 57:38.330
- You can't prove it was me.
- It was you.

57:38.414 --> 57:40.833
- Nuh-uh.
- Yes-huh.

57:43.919 --> 57:47.047
That gentleman, if you recall...
and I think you do...

57:47.131 --> 57:48.924
was some fool named Yellow-Teeth Davis

57:49.008 --> 57:51.510
that saw a lot of silly-ass girls
back in the day.

57:51.594 --> 57:54.013
And the reason why
Yellow-Teeth Davis wasn't at home

57:54.096 --> 57:56.765
when his trailer got broke into
is 'cause he was running around

57:56.849 --> 57:58.517
with one or more of those silly-ass girls

57:58.601 --> 58:00.728
instead of being
at my house like he promised

58:00.811 --> 58:02.897
to pick me up to take me
to Boutte's Chicken.

58:02.980 --> 58:05.232
And then I started wondering
what was wrong with me

58:05.316 --> 58:07.902
that made him treat me like trash.

58:07.985 --> 58:09.862
And then I waited so long figuring out

58:09.945 --> 58:12.239
what was wrong with me
that I didn't go to law school

58:12.323 --> 58:13.866
and I missed my whole life.

58:18.954 --> 58:21.081
But lately, I've been wondering,

58:21.165 --> 58:22.875
"You know what, Rayleen?

58:22.958 --> 58:24.960
Who cares what people want?

58:25.044 --> 58:26.921
What do you want?"

58:27.004 --> 58:29.423
So, from now on, my life is on me,

58:29.506 --> 58:31.383
not some fool with crowded yellow teeth

58:31.467 --> 58:33.219
that put dead deer all over his walls.

58:33.302 --> 58:35.012
It's on me.

58:35.095 --> 58:36.847
And I feel sorry for you, Miss Massey,

58:36.931 --> 58:38.432
'cause you gonna spend your whole life

58:38.515 --> 58:40.226
trying to impress fools,

58:40.309 --> 58:43.229
and you ain't never gonna
be enough for them, either.

58:43.312 --> 58:45.439
What ever happened to you, Krystal?

58:50.611 --> 58:52.863
You a bad example.

58:52.947 --> 58:54.657
This is my example.

58:57.326 --> 59:01.330
I'm going to law school,
you sad snake lady.

59:01.413 --> 59:03.540
I don't like being like this.

59:03.624 --> 59:06.043
I don't like being Nasty Miss Massey.

59:07.378 --> 59:09.546
Y'all will find life gets easier

59:09.630 --> 59:11.507
if you don't want so much.

59:13.676 --> 59:16.262
- Hey!
- "Hey" yourself.

59:16.345 --> 59:18.264
What'd you mean, law school?

59:18.347 --> 59:20.975
I mean I'm out. I'm out.

59:21.058 --> 59:24.812
I can see about law school.
I can see about a job.

59:24.895 --> 59:26.313
You leaving me?

59:26.397 --> 59:29.483
There's no leaving you
if I was never with you.

59:29.566 --> 59:31.485
You're supposed to stay here with me.

59:33.028 --> 59:35.322
How can you ask me to be there for you

59:35.406 --> 59:37.908
when I was never there for myself?

59:40.661 --> 59:43.497
So, is it over?

59:45.249 --> 59:47.876
We find a new Troop Mama now.

59:47.960 --> 59:49.670
Everyone we know got felonies.

59:49.753 --> 59:51.588
There ain't no one else.

59:51.672 --> 59:53.215
Why'd you make me want it so bad?

59:54.758 --> 59:57.845
I never wanted anything, and I was fine!

59:57.928 --> 59:59.596
Hell-No!

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.143
Why'd you do this to me?

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:05.394
I was happy before this.

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:08.772
I was happy before I thought
I could talk to anyone or be permanent.

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:10.774
Why'd you make me so unsatisfied?

01:00:12.026 --> 01:00:13.652
Stay down!

01:00:13.736 --> 01:00:16.530
You can't tell me to stay down!

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.907
Jesus wept.

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:27.750
Hell-No!

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:30.002
- Get away from me!
- Don't leave me!

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:31.462
Why don't you just leave me alone!

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:32.588
No!

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:34.965
We funna be permanent!

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:43.015
You're a dang fool.

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:45.017
Nuh-uh.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.478
- Yes-huh.
- Nuh-uh!

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:50.647
No one ever chased me before.

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:56.278
Here's your damn sash.

01:01:11.085 --> 01:01:13.045
Now, you said you borrowed it,

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:15.798
but you didn't say whether
they knew you borrowed it.

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:18.050
Do they know you borrowed it?

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:23.806
Now, hold up. Hold on.

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:25.641
These little boos need a mama.

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:27.851
Uh, Miss Rayleen, I ain't their mama.

01:01:27.935 --> 01:01:30.229
You are now.

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.235
Boss, you there?

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:37.778
Let me call you back.

01:01:40.072 --> 01:01:43.700
You ask for the boss man,
the boss man steps up.

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:46.620
- Big Eddie, let's go.
- Joseph!

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:48.455
Sam, Buddy, Robby, let's go!

01:01:48.539 --> 01:01:51.917
Miss Massey gonna learn a thing or two.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.294
Nancy. Mary.

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:55.671
Let's go.

Principal Massey,
may I have a word, ma'am?

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.629
I ain't got time for this, Ramsey Flint.

01:02:37.713 --> 01:02:39.006
Listen, devil woman.

01:02:39.089 --> 01:02:40.799
I read your rule book.

01:02:40.883 --> 01:02:43.677
Nobody beat the boss man
when it come to rule books.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.474
Nothing in that book say
the Troop Mother has to be female.

01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:52.603
Therefore, I am proud
to be the Troop Mother

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:54.813
for Birdie Scout Troop Zero of Wiggly.

01:02:54.897 --> 01:02:58.233
There are ways things are done, Mr. Flint.

01:02:58.317 --> 01:03:00.944
What kind of world
would it be if every homely,

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:03.864
strange little girl
thought she could just go out

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:05.616
and do whatever she wanted?

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:09.411
To be laughed at
and humiliated and ruined?

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:11.622
I'm helping them more than you do.

01:03:11.705 --> 01:03:14.374
You think this was easy for me?

01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:18.128
These are our girls. All of us.

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:20.005
Whole damn town of Wiggly.

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:22.090
I don't care how many eyes they got

01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:24.051
or who wet the bed or...

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:27.095
if some of them debatable as girls.

01:03:27.179 --> 01:03:31.308
They our Birdies,
and I'm their Troop Mama.

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:33.685
You tell her, Ramsey.

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:38.232
How you gonna pay the $500 entry fee?

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.359
Son of a puppy.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.153
Five...

01:03:43.237 --> 01:03:44.947
It costs money to pay
for these judges' time.

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:47.449
You got $500, Ramsey Flint?

01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:48.784
You don't.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:52.663
Because Ramsey Flint,
he just keeps on losing.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.840
You know I'd give you

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:06.343
the whole gosh damn
solar system if I could.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.303
Yeah, I know that.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.146
Mr. Ramsey?

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:24.695
I know I've been owing you 50 for a while.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:26.071
Thanks.

01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:28.323
And this is for Big Sam's legal fees.

01:04:29.408 --> 01:04:31.827
And the broken furniture.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:35.998
Buddy's public... urination.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:37.791
A-And Robby's truancy.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:40.460
I-I'm sorry it took me so long
to get it to you, Ramsey.

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:42.963
That's all right.

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:45.591
You know what for.

01:04:45.674 --> 01:04:48.010
- Yeah.
- Here you go, Ramsey.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.886
Oh. Thank you.

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.847
- Here's mine.
- Thank you.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:53.515
Ramsey, I got 17.

01:04:56.602 --> 01:04:59.730
What you don't seem
to understand, Miss Massey,

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:02.566
I'm the boss man,

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:05.694

Yeah!

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:13.493
- Good day, ma'am.
- Yeah, Ramsey!

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:14.953
- Let's fall out!
- Falling out.

01:05:15.037 --> 01:05:16.955
All right, here we go.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.792

If it's all gonna be okay,

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:31.511
will you please give me a sign?

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:33.472
Anything?

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:41.104
Look, I know
one thing... y'all funna win.

01:05:41.188 --> 01:05:43.231
- Oh...
- No, I can feel it.

01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:46.151
That's gas. You eat like
you got a train to catch.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:47.444
Nah.

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:49.279
What if I lose in front of everybody?

01:05:49.363 --> 01:05:50.864
Ah, so what?

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:56.203
Boss, get over here.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.246
Yes, sir.

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:02.959
Sit here.

01:06:05.504 --> 01:06:09.257
Boss, you know I lose
in front of everybody

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:10.717
- every day.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:12.386
Sure as hell do.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:16.306
When the judge says to me it's over,

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:19.226
I go over to the prosecution,
and I shake their hand.

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:21.144
Give me your hand.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:24.106
'Cause that show them they may beat me,

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.233
but I'm strong as hell,

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:29.403
and one day, maybe tomorrow,

01:06:29.486 --> 01:06:31.613
I'll kick their ass.

01:06:31.697 --> 01:06:33.949
Right?

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:36.284
But you still lost.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.289
Yeah, boss, but it's the principle.

01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:46.086
- What?
- Forget it.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.880
- You a little young for it.
- Christmas!

01:06:48.964 --> 01:06:50.173
Christmas!

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:52.968
Not too long. Big day tomorrow.

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:55.303
Y'all gonna win. I can feel it. I know it.

01:06:55.387 --> 01:06:56.930
You know you're drunk again.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:57.931
Nah.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:06:58.974
You're drunk.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:00.517
Yeah, he drunk as all hell.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.227
- You drunk.
- Yeah.

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:06.148
And you the best damn employee I ever had.

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:08.734
Well, I'm the only one that
hasn't stole from you, so...

01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:14.948
You know, I-I don't want you
breaking my daughter's heart.

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.451
Well, it's gonna break
if she let one of those

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.619
nasty girls tell her who she is.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:22.038
Well, now, that ain't what I mean.

01:07:22.122 --> 01:07:23.832
What do you mean?

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:25.459
You could, uh...

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.879
you could stay, right?

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:32.883
I can't.

01:07:32.966 --> 01:07:35.302
There's a spot at Emory.
I start in the fall.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:37.304
Yeah. All right.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:40.682
I-I know. I know.

01:07:40.766 --> 01:07:44.269
We'll be fine.

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:46.229
We'll be just fine.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.152
Come on.

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:53.862
Hurry up!

01:07:53.945 --> 01:07:55.655
Come on, get on, get on.

01:07:57.491 --> 01:07:59.367
Here you go, honey.

01:07:59.451 --> 01:08:01.369
Here you go.

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:06.249
Here you go, baby.

01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:08.418
- What it is, Dwayne?
- What you say, boss?

01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:12.047
Where'd you get that bike?
Dwayne, you are on parole.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.133
I'm gonna give it back. I...
Look, I'm here for protection.

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:17.135
Yeah, I just, I just want to do

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:18.845
something nice, Miss Rayleen.

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:21.932
Dear God, blanket us with protection,

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:23.767
and I ask, God,

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.603
give these children
a long life with no fears.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:29.104
And that you put the love
that's on your heart

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:30.148
unto my heart.

01:08:30.232 --> 01:08:32.149
Shut your face up.

01:08:32.234 --> 01:08:34.819
You don't know what you talking about.

01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:36.404
See you in Marietta.

01:09:00.428 --> 01:09:02.305
Hey, that's my motorcycle.

01:09:02.389 --> 01:09:04.015
He stole that.

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:57.152
All right.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:58.904
Here we are.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:04.159
Prepare for battle.

01:10:16.588 --> 01:10:19.716
I want y'all to know that y'all my boos.

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.093
And I wish I had y'all around

01:10:22.177 --> 01:10:25.722
when I was little and dumb and sweet.

01:10:27.641 --> 01:10:30.101
Come on, we funna win.

01:10:30.185 --> 01:10:32.395
We funna win! Come on.

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:42.530
Hey.

01:10:42.614 --> 01:10:44.658
"Hey" yourself.

01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:48.912
Uh, if I was, um...

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:55.752
If I got on the record, I'd be important.

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:59.631
And you'd stay here with me.

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:02.008
Oh, God.

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:04.928
I'm gonna be all alone again.

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.429
You are not alone.

01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:08.014
- Yeah, I am.
- No...

01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:09.557
And you don't need that record.

01:11:09.641 --> 01:11:12.310
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't.

01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:15.981
Who's smarter, me or you?

01:11:16.064 --> 01:11:18.692
- You.
- Right now.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.903
When you speak, it creates a sound wave,

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:24.489
and then it vibrates through the air,

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:26.449
and it keeps traveling out.

01:11:26.533 --> 01:11:28.159
That means, if someone's listening

01:11:28.243 --> 01:11:30.870
for life on this Earth,
they gonna hear you.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:32.706
Are you sure that's even true?

01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:35.917
Shoot, no.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:38.086
Probably not.

01:11:42.173 --> 01:11:43.883
Probably all you can wish for

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:46.594
is someone fool enough to show up.

01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:47.971
Hey, you want me to help?

01:11:48.054 --> 01:11:49.556
I got it, I got it.

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.641
- I don't mind helping.
- I got it.

01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:52.767
Now, the wings, you can't...

01:11:52.851 --> 01:11:54.602
Hey, I don't want them to bend.

01:11:54.686 --> 01:11:56.604
- Big Eddie, you got that?
- I got it.

01:11:56.688 --> 01:11:58.732
- I-I'm cool. I got it.
- All right. I'm happy to help.

01:12:00.191 --> 01:12:02.360
Hold on to that rocket, all right?

01:12:02.444 --> 01:12:04.237
Coming down. Coming down.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.239
- Let's fall out!
- Coming down!

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:07.949
We funna kick some butt today.

01:12:08.033 --> 01:12:09.701
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:12.120
- Got it?
- Pull it on down.

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.164
I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.750
Oh, oh, oh, I ain't got it.
I ain't got it.

01:12:29.137 --> 01:12:31.306
Don't touch.

01:12:31.389 --> 01:12:32.849
Stop.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.562
Bed wetter.

01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:46.946
All right. Troop Zero, Wiggly.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.490
Oh.

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:51.284
Precious. And you are?

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.702
Oh, uh, Ramsey Flint.

01:12:52.786 --> 01:12:54.454
- Troop Mama.
- Oh.

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.414
Isn't that something?

01:12:56.498 --> 01:12:58.124
Hmm.

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:00.585
Did y'all bring your... your fees?

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:02.295
Oh. Of course I got it.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:03.838
Yeah, that's part of Jamboree.

01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:05.340
Yeah, there you go.

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:06.800
Thank you.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.635
I'm gonna need you to count that, please.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.428
Well, we look forward

01:13:10.512 --> 01:13:13.306
to seeing what you little girls
are made of.

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:16.601
Uh-huh. What is it, angel?

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:19.604
We're made of organs and tissues.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.316
You guys got a latrine here?

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:24.818
Mm-hmm, we do have a latrine.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:27.487
We have about eight latrines all around.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:28.905
They are made for little girls,

01:13:28.988 --> 01:13:30.615
so you're gonna have to squeeze in there.

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:32.033
I could just use the woods.

01:13:32.117 --> 01:13:33.952
Do not use the woods. I repeat,

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:36.412
- do not use the woods.
- All right. All right.

01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:38.248
Well, y'all have some time to rehearse,

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:41.960
and then we will see you
over in the tent at 4:00.

01:13:42.043 --> 01:13:43.378
Let's fall out.

01:13:43.461 --> 01:13:46.131
See you by 4:00 for the show.

01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:48.716
Fly, Birdies, to that tent,

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.469
'cause at Jamboree, fun and talent abound.

01:13:51.553 --> 01:13:53.346
Don't get too loose with that fun, though,

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.807
'cause you are being judged.

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:58.309
Let's have a blast.

01:13:58.393 --> 01:14:00.520
The tent at 4:00.

01:14:27.839 --> 01:14:29.591
They are judging us. Do you understand?

01:14:29.674 --> 01:14:31.176
Act right.

01:14:35.346 --> 01:14:38.099
Welcome, Birdies, to Jamboree.

01:14:38.183 --> 01:14:41.060
Oh.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.937
Yes.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:46.232
Now...

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:48.902

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.070
and that work is not gonna stop now,

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.323
because this... this is the place

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:55.283
where we're gonna see
the best of the best.

01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:58.077
And who knows?
There may be a little bit of

01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:01.122
international prestige
in with this as well.

01:15:01.206 --> 01:15:03.499
Uh, Dr. Persad.

01:15:05.752 --> 01:15:08.004
Young ladies are here on this Earth

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:11.424
to create beauty
wherever they set their feet.

01:15:11.507 --> 01:15:13.384
So go on, now.

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:18.681
We're gonna begin

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:41.412

01:24:21.766 --> 01:24:24.560
of how to be...

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:27.480
and how not to be.

Y'all, we've come to possibly

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:33.319
the most exciting part of the day.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:36.447
Dr. Persad is gonna hand out the awards.

01:24:49.335 --> 01:24:53.964
We were really touched by
the courage every troop showed.

01:24:54.048 --> 01:24:56.967
It wasn't an easy call to make, because...

01:24:57.051 --> 01:25:00.763
what does "the best"
even mean in the big picture?

01:25:00.846 --> 01:25:04.600
Who decides what's good, what's worth it?

01:25:05.893 --> 01:25:08.479
Who knows?

The winner of this year's Jamboree...

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:15.861
and the troop whose voice
will go into outer space

01:25:15.945 --> 01:25:18.405
is Troop Five from Wiggly.

01:25:18.489 --> 01:25:22.660

ambassadors of the human race.

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:25.538

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:29.333

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:53.357
- You?
- And that's what we're

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.901
working for here at Jamboree:
to be clearly the best

01:25:55.985 --> 01:25:58.487
and to clearly beat everyone else here,

01:25:58.571 --> 01:26:00.322
and they did it, y'all.

01:26:00.406 --> 01:26:03.951
Now, Mr. Persad, can you please record?

01:26:07.288 --> 01:26:09.248
Can you give me a puff?

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:16.839
