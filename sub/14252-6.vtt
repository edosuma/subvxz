01:30.323 --> 01:32.291
We're here.

01:53.784 --> 01:55.945
The glacial fractures
are stable.

01:58.122 --> 02:00.249
We're clear to beam inside.

02:00.324 --> 02:02.155
Acknowledged.

02:15.706 --> 02:17.936
Not exactly the way
l remember it.

02:41.732 --> 02:43.859
Power grid's been destroyed.

02:43.968 --> 02:48.200
Neural gel packs-- frozen solid.

02:48.305 --> 02:51.934
Decks 9 through 14
are now Deck 10.

02:52.009 --> 02:53.374
They've been compacted.

02:53.444 --> 02:55.674
Looks like they hit the ice
at full impulse.

02:57.481 --> 02:59.005
The EMH?

02:59.083 --> 03:00.550
l'm trying to access Sick Bay.

03:00.618 --> 03:02.108
The relays aren't responding.

03:02.186 --> 03:03.448
l'm losing the interface.

03:03.521 --> 03:04.613
Reset the power cell.

03:10.194 --> 03:11.320
Come on!

03:11.395 --> 03:12.555
Let's get moving.

03:12.630 --> 03:14.222
Keep an open com-link.

04:46.991 --> 04:48.185
Chakotay to Tessa.

04:48.259 --> 04:49.317
Go ahead.

04:49.393 --> 04:50.883
l found her.

04:50.961 --> 04:53.293
Lock on to the transporter relay
and beam her to the lab.

04:53.364 --> 04:54.296
Stand by.

04:54.365 --> 04:55.627
Make it quick.

04:55.699 --> 04:59.294
This isn't exactly
a happy reunion.

04:59.403 --> 05:01.030
l've got a lock.

05:08.379 --> 05:09.846
Please state the nature of...

05:09.914 --> 05:10.903
Long time no see.

05:10.981 --> 05:11.913
Ensign.

05:11.982 --> 05:12.914
l go by Harry now.

05:12.983 --> 05:13.915
lt's a long story.

05:13.984 --> 05:15.451
Where's your mobile emitter?

05:15.519 --> 05:17.350
What's happened to the ship?
The crew?

05:17.421 --> 05:18.513
No time. The emitter.

05:18.589 --> 05:19.817
lt's in here, but...

05:22.092 --> 05:23.320
Here.

05:23.460 --> 05:24.722
Slap it on and let's go.

05:24.795 --> 05:27.025
Wait. l demand an explanation.

05:27.097 --> 05:29.793
l'll give you one.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.368
We're here to change history.

06:08.839 --> 06:13.037
Ladies and gentlemen, please...

06:13.110 --> 06:14.338
may l introduce

06:14.411 --> 06:18.074
the next generation
of instellar propulsion--

06:18.148 --> 06:22.084
the quantum slipstream drive.

06:24.154 --> 06:27.988
Four years, two months,
1 1 days--

06:28.058 --> 06:30.049
that's precisely how long

06:30.127 --> 06:32.652
Voyager's been
in the Delta Quadrant.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.163
And during that time,

06:34.231 --> 06:37.166
we've advanced
the frontiers of exploration

06:37.267 --> 06:39.633
and, more importantly,
we've survived.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.193
Hear, hear.

06:41.305 --> 06:43.205
Now it's time to go home.

06:44.842 --> 06:46.901
Enjoy the celebration,
but keep in mind,

06:46.977 --> 06:49.741
we've still got a lot of work
to do before tomorrow's flight.

06:49.813 --> 06:51.713
Go easy on that champagne,
Lieutenant.

06:53.417 --> 06:54.884
Quantum matrix...

06:54.952 --> 06:56.112
Benamite crystals...

06:56.186 --> 06:57.380
Borg technology...

06:57.488 --> 06:59.513
Can you imagine
what Starfleet is going to say?

06:59.590 --> 07:01.182
l don't think
we'll hear any complaints.

07:01.258 --> 07:03.021
The Federation's
first slipstream drive--

07:03.093 --> 07:05.220
they'll probably nominate us
for the Cochrane Medal of Honor.

07:05.295 --> 07:07.126
l'll start working
on my acceptance speech.

07:07.197 --> 07:09.062
''l'd like to thank
the Borg collective...''

07:09.133 --> 07:10.065
Dinner plans?

07:10.134 --> 07:11.726
Nothing special.
Date with a replicator.

07:11.835 --> 07:12.802
Cancel it.
That's an order.

07:12.870 --> 07:14.337
Aye, Captain.

07:15.406 --> 07:16.464
Lieutenant?

07:16.573 --> 07:17.835
Lieutenant.

07:17.908 --> 07:19.569
Excuse me.

07:19.643 --> 07:23.010
My contribution
to the slipstream drive.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.604
Thanks.
What is it?

07:24.681 --> 07:27.309
A Talaxian furfly.

07:27.451 --> 07:30.716
An old spacefaring tradition
among my people.

07:30.788 --> 07:33.313
lf one of these creatures
stowed away on your ship,

07:33.390 --> 07:35.790
it was a sign of good fortune.

07:35.859 --> 07:37.850
l had this little fellow
preserved.

07:37.928 --> 07:40.556
He hung in my engine room
for six years.

07:42.132 --> 07:43.497
Cute.

07:43.600 --> 07:46.967
Mr. Neelix, you are an unending
source of astonishment.

07:47.037 --> 07:48.402
Why, thank you, Mr. Vulcan.

07:58.082 --> 07:59.777
Seven?

07:59.850 --> 08:03.342
My visual processors
and motor cortex--

08:03.420 --> 08:05.854
they are malfunctioning.

08:05.923 --> 08:08.790
Sounds like a problem
with your cortical implant.

08:08.859 --> 08:09.985
We'd better have a look.

08:11.829 --> 08:12.955
Hold still.

08:13.030 --> 08:14.861
l cannot comply.

08:14.932 --> 08:16.490
You're intoxicated.

08:16.567 --> 08:17.864
lmpossible.

08:17.968 --> 08:20.596
Your blood synthehol level
is .05 percent.

08:20.704 --> 08:22.934
How many glasses of champagne
did you consume?

08:23.006 --> 08:24.200
One.

08:24.308 --> 08:26.276
Obviously, the Borg
can't hold their liquor.

08:26.376 --> 08:27.400
Come to Sick Bay.

08:27.544 --> 08:29.444
l'll give you some inaprovaline
to counteract the effects.

08:29.546 --> 08:31.912
l was simply trying
to perfect my social skills

08:31.982 --> 08:33.414
as you instructed me to do.

08:33.484 --> 08:34.883
And you're doing a fine job.

08:37.154 --> 08:38.121
You have always been

08:38.188 --> 08:39.985
of enormous assistance
to me, Doctor.

08:40.057 --> 08:42.321
You... you are my mentor.

08:42.392 --> 08:43.654
Yes.

08:43.727 --> 08:47.185
We are as one.
We are as one.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.631
Did you see that?

08:51.735 --> 08:52.793
Hmm.

08:52.903 --> 08:56.430
l think our drone did
a little too much celebrating.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.508
Speaking of which, when are
you going to join the party?

08:58.609 --> 09:00.577
ln a minute.

09:00.677 --> 09:04.010
You're running a warp core
diagnostic now?

09:04.081 --> 09:08.177
Harry, l think
we built an Edsel.

09:08.252 --> 09:09.344
A what?

09:09.419 --> 09:12.513
A lemon;
a disaster waiting to happen.

09:12.656 --> 09:15.921
l ran a simulation last night

09:15.993 --> 09:18.393
and l discovered
a .42 phase variance

09:18.529 --> 09:20.394
in the slipstream threshold.

09:20.531 --> 09:23.398
.42?
So it'll be a bumpy ride.

09:23.567 --> 09:24.556
We've flown through worse.

09:24.668 --> 09:26.033
lf we get knocked out of
that slipstream mid-flight...

09:27.404 --> 09:29.929
it could overload
the quantum matrix.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.439
Did you tell the Captain?

09:31.508 --> 09:32.805
Not yet.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.776
l didn't want to spoil
the festivities

09:34.845 --> 09:35.903
until l was sure.

09:35.979 --> 09:38.413
Tom, if it'll make you
feel better,

09:38.482 --> 09:40.109
we'll go
to the holodeck right now,

09:40.184 --> 09:41.651
run a few more simulations.

09:41.718 --> 09:43.208
lt's probably
just a sensor glitch.

09:44.254 --> 09:46.245
We're at full impulse.

09:46.323 --> 09:48.553
Engaging slipstream drive.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.786
Quantum field is stable.

09:50.861 --> 09:52.761
Deflector at maximum.

09:52.829 --> 09:58.165
Slipstream velocity
in four, three, two...

10:01.605 --> 10:02.731
Power output is steady.

10:02.839 --> 10:05.273
Quantum field is holding.

10:05.342 --> 10:07.708
Shields down to 73 percent.

10:07.778 --> 10:08.972
Looking good.

10:09.046 --> 10:10.673
Keep that deflector aligned
and we should be...

10:12.783 --> 10:14.774
We've got a phase variance--
point one.

10:14.851 --> 10:15.977
Point two.

10:16.053 --> 10:17.987
Remodulate the deflector.

10:18.055 --> 10:19.852
No effect.
Point four.

10:19.923 --> 10:21.356
l'm shutting down the drive.

10:21.425 --> 10:23.086
No, wait. l want to invert
the quantum field.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.388
lt's no use.

10:24.461 --> 10:26.429
That slipstream is collapsing.

10:28.465 --> 10:30.831
lnertial dampers are off-line.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.401
Warning.
Hull breach on Deck 10.

10:32.469 --> 10:33.993
We're losing
structural integrity.

10:34.104 --> 10:36.072
Computer, freeze program!

10:38.675 --> 10:40.370
One more time.
l think if we reroute

10:40.444 --> 10:42.241
emergency power to the deflector
a little earlier...

10:42.312 --> 10:43.370
lt won't help.

10:43.447 --> 10:44.414
Computer,

10:44.481 --> 10:46.142
restart simulation
at time index...

10:46.216 --> 10:47.615
Computer, belay that order.

10:47.684 --> 10:48.981
lt's no use, Harry.

10:49.052 --> 10:50.212
We can't just give up.

10:50.287 --> 10:52.687
23 simulations, 23 catastrophes.

10:52.756 --> 10:54.656
This is no sensor glitch.

10:58.195 --> 10:59.822
We've got to tell them.

10:59.896 --> 11:01.090
That can't be right.

11:01.164 --> 11:03.792
We tested this engine
molecule by molecule.

11:03.867 --> 11:05.300
l'm sorry, B'Elanna.

11:05.402 --> 11:07.700
l wish to examine
the results of the simulation.

11:07.771 --> 11:09.466
Holodeck 2--
run them for yourself.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.507
That is, if you don't mind being
vaporized a few dozen times.

11:12.643 --> 11:14.372
l looked at their findings,
Captain.

11:14.444 --> 11:16.469
lf we try to take
that flight in the morning,

11:16.546 --> 11:18.343
we'll be in escape pods
by afternoon.

11:18.415 --> 11:21.077
lt would appear we have
no choice but to cancel it.

11:21.151 --> 11:24.609
Either that or...

11:24.688 --> 11:26.519
we can try it Harry's way.

11:26.590 --> 11:28.558
Ensign?

11:32.062 --> 11:33.086
l've got an idea.

11:33.163 --> 11:35.290
lt's tricky,
but l think it could work.

11:35.365 --> 11:38.232
The trouble begins about
17 seconds into the flight.

11:38.335 --> 11:39.927
The phase variance kicks in

11:40.037 --> 11:41.902
and the slipstream
becomes unstable.

11:41.972 --> 11:43.940
What we need is
someone in a shuttle

11:44.007 --> 11:46.168
to ride the rapids
in front of Voyager.

11:46.243 --> 11:47.403
Yes.

11:47.477 --> 11:49.877
They could map the threshold
of the slipstream

11:49.946 --> 11:51.038
as it's forming

11:51.114 --> 11:53.241
and send the phase corrections
back to us.

11:53.317 --> 11:55.080
That is a great idea, Harry.

11:55.152 --> 11:57.950
Now, here's the tricky part.

11:59.690 --> 12:01.089
The shuttle will only be

12:01.158 --> 12:03.285
a couple of seconds
ahead of Voyager.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.021
That doesn't give
auto-navigation

12:05.095 --> 12:06.357
much time to compensate.

12:06.430 --> 12:08.591
Tom?

12:08.665 --> 12:10.292
Couple of seconds?

12:10.367 --> 12:11.857
We can do this, Captain.

12:11.935 --> 12:13.163
Put me on that shuttle.

12:13.270 --> 12:15.500
l'll get Voyager
through the slipstream.

12:19.176 --> 12:20.734
What choice do we have?

12:20.811 --> 12:22.073
Take the drive off-line?

12:22.145 --> 12:23.635
Months of work for nothing?

12:23.714 --> 12:25.944
We built a highly experimental
piece of technology.

12:26.016 --> 12:27.381
There were bound to be setbacks.

12:27.517 --> 12:29.849
The benamite crystals
at the heart of this engine

12:29.920 --> 12:31.387
have already started to decay.

12:31.455 --> 12:34.788
lt could take years
to synthesize more.

12:34.858 --> 12:37.793
l don't know
about the rest of you,

12:37.861 --> 12:39.556
but l didn't do all this work

12:39.629 --> 12:43.622
just to be stopped
by a .42 phase variance.

12:43.734 --> 12:45.201
No offense, Captain.

12:45.268 --> 12:47.498
None taken.

12:47.604 --> 12:49.902
All right, Mr. Kim...

12:49.973 --> 12:52.203
you've convinced me.

12:52.275 --> 12:53.537
Prepare a flight plan

12:53.610 --> 12:56.044
and have it on my desk
within the hour.

12:56.113 --> 12:57.876
Yes, ma'am.

12:57.948 --> 13:00.143
l'll let you know what l decide.

13:10.026 --> 13:11.050
Come in.

13:12.996 --> 13:15.760
Commander, l hope
you've got an appetite.

13:15.832 --> 13:17.857
Famished, but l assumed
you called me here

13:17.968 --> 13:19.663
to talk about
the slipstream flight.

13:19.770 --> 13:22.068
No reason to cancel
our dinner plans.

13:23.707 --> 13:24.765
l've programmed a dish

13:24.875 --> 13:27.036
my grandmother used
to make back on Earth--

13:27.110 --> 13:28.907
vegetable biryani.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.606
Sounds delicious.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.113
l didn't know you could cook.

13:32.182 --> 13:35.310
Normally, l draw the line
at a pot of coffee,

13:35.385 --> 13:37.319
but tonight
is a special occasion.

13:37.387 --> 13:39.321
Oh?

13:39.389 --> 13:41.380
Our last night
in the Delta Quadrant.

13:41.491 --> 13:43.220
l'd say that's special enough.

13:44.294 --> 13:46.922
You've made your decision.

13:46.997 --> 13:49.022
We launch tomorrow at 0800.

13:49.099 --> 13:51.090
You and Harry
will take the Delta Flyer.

13:51.201 --> 13:52.896
Voyager will be
right behind you.

13:55.839 --> 13:57.966
The crew will be pleased.

13:58.074 --> 13:59.871
You can give them
the news yourself...

13:59.943 --> 14:01.911
after dessert.

14:05.115 --> 14:06.548
What about you, Chakotay?

14:06.616 --> 14:08.447
What do you think
about my decision?

14:12.522 --> 14:14.956
l've analyzed
Harry's flight plan.

14:15.025 --> 14:16.617
The theory is sound,

14:16.726 --> 14:18.353
but there are just
too many variables.

14:18.462 --> 14:20.555
lf something goes wrong
in that slipstream...

14:20.630 --> 14:23.030
This could be our only chance
to use the quantum drive.

14:23.099 --> 14:25.727
True, but if you
showed this data

14:25.836 --> 14:27.861
to any Starfleet engineer,

14:27.971 --> 14:31.031
they'd think we were
out of our minds.

14:31.141 --> 14:32.665
We can find another way home.

14:32.776 --> 14:34.004
We've waited this long.

14:34.077 --> 14:36.068
Long enough.
We've waited long enough.

14:38.849 --> 14:41.750
l know it's a risk...

14:41.818 --> 14:44.912
probably our biggest one yet...

14:44.988 --> 14:46.580
but l'm willing to take it.

14:46.656 --> 14:47.918
Are you with me?

14:47.991 --> 14:50.482
Always.

14:55.732 --> 14:57.700
Speaking of risks...

15:00.136 --> 15:03.037
are you ready to try
some home cooking?

15:03.106 --> 15:05.074
l'll alert Sick Bay.

15:25.262 --> 15:26.627
15 years?

15:26.696 --> 15:28.323
Give or take a few weeks.

15:28.465 --> 15:29.454
Where are we?

15:29.533 --> 15:32.331
ln the Takara sector
just outside the Alpha Quadrant.

15:32.435 --> 15:33.367
The crew?

15:33.436 --> 15:34.596
Except for us... dead.

15:34.704 --> 15:36.035
We think Captain Janeway

15:36.106 --> 15:38.904
tried to make an emergency
landing on this planet.

15:38.975 --> 15:41.375
The ship must have been
too heavily damaged.

15:41.511 --> 15:43.308
They were all killed on impact.

15:43.380 --> 15:45.177
You've been buried
inside a glacier

15:45.248 --> 15:46.681
for the past 15 years.

15:46.750 --> 15:50.743
You two were here,
on the Delta Flyer

15:50.820 --> 15:52.253
ahead of Voyager.

15:52.322 --> 15:53.755
You made it.

15:53.823 --> 15:55.381
All the way back to Earth.

15:55.492 --> 15:56.925
We got home, Doc,

15:56.993 --> 16:00.156
and all it took was killing
everyone we cared about.

16:00.230 --> 16:01.094
Harry.

16:02.432 --> 16:04.866
Starfleet certainly took
their time finding us.

16:04.968 --> 16:06.868
Starfleet...

16:06.937 --> 16:10.668
Starfleet gave up their search
for Voyager over nine years ago.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.765
We had to find you on our own.

16:12.876 --> 16:17.313
Well, l don't know what
to say except... thank you.

16:17.414 --> 16:20.679
l suppose l'd have stayed
in that deep freeze forever.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.684
We're not here
to salvage your program.

16:22.752 --> 16:25.585
We're here to prevent this
disaster from ever happening.

16:25.655 --> 16:27.589
You see, Doc,

16:27.657 --> 16:30.820
15 years ago, l miscalculated
the slipstream threshold

16:30.894 --> 16:34.159
and transmitted the wrong phase
corrections to Voyager.

16:34.230 --> 16:35.663
Boom.

16:35.732 --> 16:37.791
They were knocked
out of the slipstream

16:37.901 --> 16:39.266
and sent to an icy death.

16:39.369 --> 16:40.734
''Thank you, Ensign Kim.''

16:40.804 --> 16:43.329
But l've had a long time
to rethink my mistake,

16:43.473 --> 16:46.704
and now l know how to fix it.

16:46.776 --> 16:50.644
So... we're going
to send Voyager

16:50.714 --> 16:53.080
a new set of phase corrections.

16:54.718 --> 16:57.243
lsn't it a little late for that?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.982
We've found a way to communicate
with Voyager in the past,

17:00.056 --> 17:01.216
just before the accident.

17:01.291 --> 17:02.553
Better late than never.

17:02.626 --> 17:04.924
A message back through time?

17:04.994 --> 17:05.983
Exactly.

17:06.061 --> 17:06.993
How?

17:14.371 --> 17:15.667
l don't understand.

17:15.771 --> 17:18.400
One of her cranial implants
is a transceiver

17:18.474 --> 17:19.839
designed to communicate
with other drones.

17:19.909 --> 17:20.840
That's right.

17:20.910 --> 17:22.969
lt's called
an interplexing beacon.

17:23.046 --> 17:24.479
We want you
to extract the beacon

17:24.547 --> 17:26.276
and determine
its translink frequency.

17:26.348 --> 17:27.748
That shouldn't be a problem.

17:27.817 --> 17:29.717
She looks reasonably
well-preserved.

17:29.786 --> 17:32.448
Good. That'll tell us
where to send the message.

17:32.522 --> 17:35.491
Now, the hard part--
we need to know when to send it.

17:35.558 --> 17:38.049
Can you access
Seven's chronometric node

17:38.128 --> 17:40.790
and pinpoint the exact moment
her cybernetic implants

17:40.864 --> 17:43.196
disengaged
from her organic systems?

17:43.266 --> 17:44.597
Her time of death?

17:44.701 --> 17:46.328
Down to the millisecond,
if possible.

17:46.503 --> 17:47.993
l'll see what l can do.

17:48.104 --> 17:50.072
l told you he'd come in handy.

17:51.908 --> 17:52.966
You said you'd found a way

17:53.076 --> 17:54.737
to communicate
with Seven in the past.

17:54.811 --> 17:55.778
How?

17:59.282 --> 18:02.683
Behold...
Salvage Component 36698--

18:02.752 --> 18:05.380
a Borg temporal transmitter.

18:05.522 --> 18:07.786
Starfleet lntelligence found it

18:07.857 --> 18:10.223
in the wreckage of a Borg cube
in the Beta Quadrant.

18:10.293 --> 18:11.385
We stole it.

18:15.098 --> 18:16.190
Trouble.

18:16.266 --> 18:18.598
Long-range sensors are picking
up a Federation vessel.

18:18.702 --> 18:19.726
How much time do we have?

18:19.836 --> 18:21.895
l entered a low orbit
and remodulated our shields,

18:22.005 --> 18:24.064
but it won't be long
before they find us.

18:24.174 --> 18:25.539
Six hours if we're lucky.

18:25.608 --> 18:27.235
Let me get this straight...

18:27.310 --> 18:29.244
you're fugitives?

18:29.312 --> 18:31.143
''Galaxy's Most Wanted.''

18:31.214 --> 18:33.409
We stole the Delta Flyer, too...

18:33.483 --> 18:35.451
right out
of a Federation shipyard.

18:35.585 --> 18:37.576
We're wanted on two counts
of high treason

18:37.654 --> 18:40.680
and conspiracy to violate
the Temporal Prime Directive.

18:40.757 --> 18:42.224
Wonderful.

18:42.292 --> 18:44.157
Out of the icebox
and into the fire.

18:44.227 --> 18:46.161
We don't have time for this.
Get started.

18:46.229 --> 18:47.787
Aye, sir.

18:47.864 --> 18:49.126
We still have to retrieve
those sensor logs.

18:49.199 --> 18:50.166
Get ready.

18:55.739 --> 18:56.831
Hello, Doctor.

18:56.940 --> 18:57.964
Do l know you?

18:58.074 --> 19:00.474
No, but l feel
like we're old friends.

19:00.543 --> 19:01.510
Tessa Omond.

19:01.578 --> 19:03.045
Hello.

19:03.113 --> 19:06.378
lt's an honor to finally meet
Voyager's infamous EMH.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.973
''lnfamous''?

19:08.051 --> 19:09.643
l've told her
a few horror stories.

19:09.719 --> 19:13.314
Actually, they've always
spoken very highly of you.

19:13.389 --> 19:15.323
Uh-huh... and how did
you get involved

19:15.391 --> 19:16.756
with Bonnie and Clyde here?

19:16.860 --> 19:19.795
Oh, l've had an interest
in Voyager for a long time.

19:19.829 --> 19:21.262
They're having sex.

19:21.331 --> 19:22.992
Pardon?

19:23.066 --> 19:25.000
Chakotay and Tess.

19:25.101 --> 19:27.262
They're a couple;
joined at the hip.

19:28.671 --> 19:30.138
The truth is, Doctor,

19:30.206 --> 19:33.107
l didn't want Chakotay or Harry
to have to face this alone.

19:33.176 --> 19:34.404
l thought l could help.

19:36.846 --> 19:37.835
Ready?

19:37.914 --> 19:38.938
Stay warm.

19:51.227 --> 19:53.422
These controls
are a little clumsy.

19:53.496 --> 19:56.397
l thought you said this ship
was state of the art.

19:56.466 --> 19:57.660
lt was at the time.

19:57.767 --> 19:59.894
l've located the sensor logs,

20:00.003 --> 20:03.598
but... the computer
is denying me access.

20:06.543 --> 20:09.569
My command codes should
still carry some weight.

20:19.289 --> 20:23.248
Hmm... looks like there's
an active file here.

20:24.460 --> 20:27.395
...but should our luck run out,
l'd like to say for the record

20:27.463 --> 20:29.931
that the crew of Voyager acted
with distinction and valor.

20:34.304 --> 20:36.238
You okay?

20:37.907 --> 20:39.568
Yes.

20:41.878 --> 20:44.142
lt's just...

20:44.214 --> 20:47.012
the last time
l was in this chair,

20:47.083 --> 20:49.210
they were all here...

20:49.285 --> 20:51.116
alive.

20:54.624 --> 20:56.751
We're here to get them back.

21:00.697 --> 21:02.460
Can l see that tricorder?

21:15.078 --> 21:16.477
lt's downloading.

21:16.579 --> 21:18.410
Give it a minute.

21:23.319 --> 21:25.844
l don't supposed we have time
for a tour?

21:25.922 --> 21:27.856
Afraid not.

21:27.924 --> 21:32.657
Besides,
l left my quarters a mess.

21:35.331 --> 21:39.563
ln just a few hours,
if all goes as planned,

21:39.669 --> 21:42.001
we'll have changed history.

21:42.071 --> 21:45.563
The past 15 years... erased.

21:45.675 --> 21:48.075
We don't have to do this.

21:48.144 --> 21:50.237
Now you tell me.

21:50.313 --> 21:52.611
l'm serious.

21:52.682 --> 21:56.846
So am l, and l have
no intentions of backing out.

22:02.926 --> 22:04.553
Chakotay...

22:06.996 --> 22:09.464
Look at me...

22:09.565 --> 22:12.466
last minute jitters,
cold feet...

22:12.635 --> 22:14.967
l don't know what to call it.

22:15.038 --> 22:16.403
Ridiculous, isn't it?

22:16.506 --> 22:19.669
After all these years,
working toward this moment

22:19.709 --> 22:23.543
and when it finally comes,

22:23.613 --> 22:27.014
all l can think about
is losing you.

22:27.083 --> 22:30.644
Your heart has always
been here, on Voyager.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.813
That'll never change.

22:32.889 --> 22:35.449
This is where you belong.

22:37.727 --> 22:39.490
And who knows?

22:39.562 --> 22:41.996
Maybe we'll meet someday.

22:42.065 --> 22:45.228
But if we don't...?

22:45.335 --> 22:47.826
Then l'll miss you all the same.

22:53.443 --> 22:55.411
...means all of that
has changed.

22:55.545 --> 22:57.638
You owe me one.

22:57.714 --> 23:00.444
Mr. Kim, your assistance,
please.

23:00.516 --> 23:02.177
Got to go.

23:07.390 --> 23:09.017
What was that all about?

23:09.092 --> 23:10.116
Oh, nothing.

23:10.193 --> 23:11.387
Letter to a friend.

23:11.461 --> 23:12.553
How does it look?

23:12.628 --> 23:14.425
No damage to the infrastructure,

23:14.497 --> 23:16.260
but l'll need an isoprobe.

23:16.366 --> 23:18.630
Way ahead of you, Doc.

23:23.873 --> 23:27.536
So, what was it like,
your homecoming?

23:27.610 --> 23:32.138
Antimatter fireworks,
longwinded dignitaries,

23:32.215 --> 23:34.149
a Vulcan children's choir.

23:34.217 --> 23:37.015
Oh, we got medals
pinned to our tunics.

23:37.086 --> 23:40.317
Chakotay gave a speech
commemorating the Voyager crew.

23:40.390 --> 23:42.324
Brought a tear
to everyone's eye.

23:42.392 --> 23:45.657
Admiral Maclntyre even wanted me
to marry his daughter.

23:45.728 --> 23:49.960
At least you weren't buried
under 20 meters of ice.

23:51.734 --> 23:55.261
You don't know how many times
l wished l was.

23:57.140 --> 23:59.631
l suppose
it must have been difficult

23:59.742 --> 24:04.702
with all your friends
and colleagues left behind.

24:07.383 --> 24:09.248
''Survivor guilt.''

24:09.318 --> 24:11.286
Yeah. l heard a lot about that

24:11.354 --> 24:13.788
from the counselors
back at Headquarters.

24:13.856 --> 24:17.622
''You must learn to accept
the fact that you lived.

24:17.693 --> 24:19.684
''Embrace life.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.787
Move forward.''

24:21.864 --> 24:24.890
l signed on to the first
deep space vessel

24:25.001 --> 24:26.468
l could find.

24:26.536 --> 24:28.333
We tried to calculate
where Voyager

24:28.504 --> 24:30.904
might have fallen
out of the slipstream.

24:30.973 --> 24:32.702
Four years of searching.

24:32.775 --> 24:34.174
We were close.

24:34.243 --> 24:35.676
l could feel it.

24:35.745 --> 24:38.270
Then, Starfleet Command
said it was time

24:38.347 --> 24:39.371
to end the search.

24:39.515 --> 24:42.245
''Low probability of success.''

24:42.318 --> 24:45.845
All those admirals who shook
my hand at the homecoming--

24:45.922 --> 24:48.823
l went to see
every last one of them...

24:48.891 --> 24:52.019
begged them
to keep the search alive.

24:52.095 --> 24:53.528
Pretty soon

24:53.596 --> 24:56.258
even Admiral Maclntyre
stopped returning my calls.

24:56.332 --> 24:59.631
So l resigned from Starfleet.

25:02.572 --> 25:04.597
For the record,

25:04.707 --> 25:10.839
Seven's translink
frequency is 108.44236000.

25:11.914 --> 25:13.711
Could be our lucky number.

25:13.783 --> 25:15.717
l'm encoding it now.

25:15.785 --> 25:19.721
When did you embark
on your life of crime?

25:22.492 --> 25:25.825
The second l heard
about this little gem.

25:26.896 --> 25:28.761
Mr. Kim, did you ever stop

25:28.831 --> 25:31.664
to think about what you're
trying to do here?

25:31.767 --> 25:34.531
Altering the timeline
may make things worse.

25:34.637 --> 25:36.537
At least
you and Chakotay survived.

25:36.606 --> 25:37.868
Why tempt fate?

25:37.940 --> 25:39.874
This ''timeline'' only exists

25:39.942 --> 25:42.240
because l made a mistake
15 years ago.

25:42.311 --> 25:45.075
The crew trusted in me
and l let them down.

25:46.115 --> 25:47.548
Tactical alert.

25:47.617 --> 25:51.644
Vessel approaching,
bearing 184 mark 7.

25:59.162 --> 26:00.220
They've found us.

26:00.296 --> 26:01.661
Chakotay.

26:01.731 --> 26:02.857
Go ahead.

26:02.932 --> 26:04.991
Starfleet's
on an intercept course.

26:05.101 --> 26:06.534
lt's now or never.

26:06.602 --> 26:08.069
We're on our way.

26:10.873 --> 26:13.398
lf you're having doubts,
let me know.

26:13.576 --> 26:15.567
l'll take your program off-line.

26:16.946 --> 26:21.110
But if you're with us,
we tempt fate together.

26:23.452 --> 26:25.818
To aid an honorable thief

26:25.888 --> 26:30.086
or to spend eternity
in cybernetic oblivion?

26:30.159 --> 26:33.185
Let's tempt fate.

26:44.173 --> 26:48.166
Captain's Log, Stardate 52143.6.

26:48.277 --> 26:50.336
With any luck, my next log entry

26:50.413 --> 26:52.381
will be made
in the Alpha Quadrant,

26:52.515 --> 26:55.575
but should our luck run out,
l'd like to say for the record

26:55.651 --> 26:58.882
that the crew of Voyager acted
with distinction and valor.

26:58.955 --> 27:00.286
Shield generators?

27:00.356 --> 27:01.880
On line.

27:01.958 --> 27:03.220
Plasma flow?

27:03.292 --> 27:04.520
Stable.

27:04.594 --> 27:05.561
Com-link?

27:05.628 --> 27:07.118
Secure.

27:07.196 --> 27:07.890
Lunch?

27:09.131 --> 27:10.564
Salami sandwiches.

27:11.934 --> 27:13.526
Feel up to this, Ensign?

27:13.636 --> 27:15.228
Yes, sir.

27:15.338 --> 27:17.238
Chakotay to Voyager.

27:17.340 --> 27:18.307
We're ready.

27:18.374 --> 27:21.138
All hands, this is the Captain.

27:21.210 --> 27:23.678
Take your stations,

27:23.746 --> 27:26.738
secure all systems,

27:26.816 --> 27:29.751
and stand by
for the jump to slipstream.

27:34.523 --> 27:36.821
l've established a telemetry
link with the shuttle.

27:36.892 --> 27:38.689
Match their course and speed.

27:45.801 --> 27:47.029
They're gaining on us.

27:47.136 --> 27:48.865
200,000 kilometers and closing.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.939
You call these
evasive maneuvers?

27:51.040 --> 27:52.905
l'm doing my best.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.567
Harry, status?

27:54.644 --> 27:56.874
The Borg transmitter's on line,
but l'm still waiting

27:56.946 --> 27:59.107
for the Doctor to give me
the temporal coordinates.

27:59.181 --> 28:00.478
Just a few more minutes.

28:00.549 --> 28:01.481
Speed it up.

28:01.550 --> 28:03.177
We've got a Galaxy-class
starship on our tail.

28:03.252 --> 28:04.719
l'm working as fast as l can.

28:04.787 --> 28:06.379
They're hailing us.

28:06.455 --> 28:08.082
You want to talk to them?

28:08.157 --> 28:10.591
lt could buy us some time.

28:10.660 --> 28:12.560
Open a channel.

28:12.628 --> 28:15.825
This is Captain La Forge
of the Starship Challenger.

28:15.898 --> 28:17.593
You seem to be in quite a hurry.

28:17.667 --> 28:18.827
You could say that.

28:18.934 --> 28:20.299
Why don't you

28:20.403 --> 28:22.701
shut down those impulse engines,
drop your shields

28:22.772 --> 28:24.569
and let's talk about this
face-to-face?

28:24.640 --> 28:26.232
Mind if l take a rain check?

28:26.342 --> 28:28.071
As a matter of fact, l do.

28:28.144 --> 28:29.975
We know what you're
about to attempt

28:30.046 --> 28:31.445
and we can't let that happen,

28:31.547 --> 28:34.573
so the Federation Council is
willing to make you an offer--

28:34.650 --> 28:37.710
hand over the Borg transmitter,
stand down your vessel

28:37.787 --> 28:40.278
and the charges of conspiracy
will be dropped.

28:40.356 --> 28:41.789
That's not much of an offer.

28:41.857 --> 28:43.324
lf we succeed, those charges

28:43.392 --> 28:45.417
will never have existed
in the first place.

28:45.494 --> 28:48.429
lf you succeed, countless lives
will be affected.

28:48.497 --> 28:52.024
We're here to save 150 lives--
our crew.

28:52.134 --> 28:53.465
l understand and l might

28:53.569 --> 28:56.470
be doing the same thing
if l were in your position,

28:56.539 --> 28:58.507
but l've got my own crew
to protect,

28:58.574 --> 29:00.508
not to mention
15 years of history,

29:00.576 --> 29:04.410
so... l'm asking you again.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.813
Stand down
and return the transmitter.

29:07.883 --> 29:10.044
You know l can't do that.

29:10.119 --> 29:12.178
And you know
l have to try to stop you.

29:12.254 --> 29:14.017
Yes, l know.

29:14.090 --> 29:15.523
Good luck.

29:15.558 --> 29:17.583
Same to you.

29:21.864 --> 29:23.695
They're targeting our engines.

29:23.766 --> 29:25.165
Shields to full.

29:25.234 --> 29:26.792
Stand by weapons.

29:32.908 --> 29:34.341
Voyager to Chakotay.

29:34.410 --> 29:35.570
Yes, ma'am.

29:35.644 --> 29:37.612
Prepare to enter the slipstream.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.807
Acknowledged.

29:39.882 --> 29:41.543
Engage.

29:43.552 --> 29:49.787
Slipstream velocity
in four, three, two...

29:56.832 --> 29:58.663
Shields down to 62 percent.

29:58.768 --> 30:01.396
Return fire.

30:01.504 --> 30:03.904
Direct hit.
No effect on their shields.

30:03.973 --> 30:06.032
We're no match for them,
Chakotay.

30:06.142 --> 30:07.166
Keep trying.

30:09.445 --> 30:10.673
l don't mean to be a pest,

30:10.746 --> 30:12.441
but we're losing power
back here.

30:12.515 --> 30:14.312
Hold on. We're switching
to emergency backup.

30:16.085 --> 30:17.382
Thank you.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.853
Doc, l need those
temporal coordinates now.

30:20.923 --> 30:22.720
Badgering me won't help.

30:24.460 --> 30:26.360
l'm detecting a phase variance--

30:26.429 --> 30:29.762
point one, point two...

30:29.832 --> 30:30.594
Helm?

30:30.666 --> 30:32.190
l'm still waiting for Harry.

30:32.301 --> 30:33.393
Point three.

30:33.502 --> 30:34.400
Voyager to Delta Flyer.

30:34.503 --> 30:36.266
We need those corrections

30:36.372 --> 30:38.169
or we'll have
to shut down the drive.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.400
We're on it, Captain.

30:41.377 --> 30:43.436
The threshold is fluctuating.

30:43.512 --> 30:46.913
Okay. l can do this.

30:46.982 --> 30:51.112
l'm compensating
for the spatial gradients...

30:51.187 --> 30:54.679
Deflector geometry stable.

30:56.492 --> 30:58.255
Got it!

30:59.695 --> 31:02.095
l'm receiving
the phase corrections.

31:02.164 --> 31:04.428
The phase variance
is decreasing.

31:04.533 --> 31:05.932
Shields are holding.

31:06.035 --> 31:08.799
Looks like we're on our way.

31:08.904 --> 31:11.464
Phase variance is increasing.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.700
Point three... point four.

31:14.777 --> 31:15.937
Harry, what's happening?

31:16.045 --> 31:18.775
The phase variance
is still increasing.

31:18.814 --> 31:20.372
l-l'm not sure, Captain.

31:20.449 --> 31:21.848
lt should be working.

31:21.917 --> 31:23.043
l need an answer, Harry.

31:23.118 --> 31:24.449
We're running out of time.

31:26.355 --> 31:28.755
Let me try
recalibrating the sensors.

31:28.824 --> 31:31.418
l might be overcompensating
for the variance in the...

31:34.463 --> 31:35.828
We've lost our com-link.

31:35.898 --> 31:38.162
Telemetry's down, too.

31:38.234 --> 31:40.259
The slipstream's destabilizing.

31:40.369 --> 31:41.802
Shut down the drive!

31:41.871 --> 31:43.099
l can't.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.435
There's some kind of overload
in the quantum matrix.

31:45.541 --> 31:46.599
l've lost helm control.

31:47.710 --> 31:49.143
l have it.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.872
Her cybernetic systems
were terminated

31:50.946 --> 31:53.608
on Stardate 52164.3,

31:53.682 --> 31:57.015
Borg time index 9.43852.

31:59.922 --> 32:02.914
You're encoding the transmitter
for time index 9.40?

32:02.992 --> 32:04.289
Uh-huh.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.328
That's less than four minutes
before Voyager was destroyed.

32:06.395 --> 32:07.953
Cutting it a little close,
aren't we?

32:08.030 --> 32:09.964
This is no ordinary
phone call, Doc.

32:10.032 --> 32:11.260
We're talking to yesterday.

32:11.333 --> 32:12.425
Timing is everything.

32:12.535 --> 32:14.833
l want to make sure Seven
of Nine gets the information

32:14.937 --> 32:15.995
at just the right moment.

32:17.573 --> 32:19.006
There.

32:21.744 --> 32:24.440
l'm bringing up
the new phase corrections.

32:26.849 --> 32:29.647
This was where l failed
15 years ago, Doc.

32:29.718 --> 32:32.152
This time will be different.

32:39.328 --> 32:41.296
Captain, l am receiving
a transmission.

32:41.363 --> 32:42.990
You said the com-link was down.

32:43.065 --> 32:44.191
lt is.

32:44.266 --> 32:45.597
The signal is being routed

32:45.701 --> 32:47.396
through one
of my cranial implants.

32:47.536 --> 32:50.505
lt contains
a new set of phase corrections.

32:50.606 --> 32:52.767
Does Harry know how to access
your Borg systems?

32:52.841 --> 32:54.069
No.

32:54.143 --> 32:55.838
He must have figured out a way.

32:55.911 --> 32:57.173
Enter the corrections.

32:59.214 --> 33:01.978
They're not compensating
for the phase variance.

33:02.051 --> 33:03.746
The slipstream is collapsing.

33:03.819 --> 33:05.286
Full power to the deflector.

33:05.354 --> 33:07.049
No effect.

33:07.122 --> 33:09.590
Our hull is buckling.

33:09.658 --> 33:11.387
Shields at maximum.
Hold her steady, Tom.

33:11.460 --> 33:13.587
lt's no use.
We're losing attitude control.

33:14.697 --> 33:17.723
lnertial dampers off-line!

33:17.833 --> 33:18.925
What about the Delta Flyer?.

33:19.001 --> 33:20.229
There is no sign of them.

33:20.336 --> 33:22.133
They must have remained
in the slipstream.

33:23.572 --> 33:26.132
Voyager's been thrown
into normal space.

33:26.241 --> 33:27.606
Alter our slipstream course.

33:27.676 --> 33:28.938
We've got to go back.

33:29.011 --> 33:30.273
We can't.

33:30.346 --> 33:33.315
Even if they survived reentry
at this velocity, we wouldn't.

33:33.382 --> 33:35.373
What are you saying?
We've got to find them!

33:35.517 --> 33:37.451
Ensign, there's no choice.

33:48.664 --> 33:52.259
Captain, we're just a few
parsecs from the Alpha Quadrant.

33:52.368 --> 33:54.859
Not exactly how l wanted
to cross the finish line.

33:54.970 --> 33:57.165
Hull breach
on Decks 5 through 10.

33:57.272 --> 33:58.864
We're losing life support.

34:00.309 --> 34:01.435
lf we don't land the ship,

34:01.577 --> 34:03.238
we're risking
structural collapse.

34:04.747 --> 34:08.342
l'm reading a planet
nine million kilometers ahead.

34:08.417 --> 34:10.976
lt's Class-L.

34:11.053 --> 34:11.815
Do it.

34:16.824 --> 34:19.315
We're coming in too fast.
Reverse thrusters.

34:19.460 --> 34:22.623
All hands, brace for impact!

34:47.289 --> 34:48.551
We're still here.

34:48.623 --> 34:50.319
Why are we still here?

34:50.391 --> 34:51.449
Mr. Kim?

34:53.027 --> 34:54.723
The new phase corrections
didn't work.

34:54.797 --> 34:56.161
Are you certain?

34:56.231 --> 34:58.222
lf Voyager had gotten
through safely,

34:58.300 --> 35:00.962
we wouldn't still be here
trying to save them.

35:01.070 --> 35:02.560
The transmitter's functioning.

35:02.671 --> 35:05.139
Seven must have received
our message.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.174
Chakotay, problems!

35:07.242 --> 35:08.209
l can see that.

35:10.345 --> 35:11.312
Our engines are down.

35:11.413 --> 35:13.677
They're locking on to us
with a tractor beam.

35:13.749 --> 35:14.909
Full thrusters.

35:16.185 --> 35:17.482
No effect.

35:19.855 --> 35:22.050
Do we have enough power
to send a plasma surge

35:22.124 --> 35:24.684
through their tractor beam;
break ourselves free?

35:24.760 --> 35:25.988
l think so,

35:26.061 --> 35:28.188
but the EPS relays
have taken heavy damage.

35:28.263 --> 35:30.424
lt could destabilize
the warp core.

35:30.499 --> 35:32.467
lf you want to beam
over to that ship,

35:32.534 --> 35:33.626
l'll understand.

35:33.736 --> 35:36.296
And let you have all the fun?

35:38.841 --> 35:42.277
Harry, we just bought you
a few more minutes.

35:42.344 --> 35:43.368
Acknowledged.

35:43.512 --> 35:44.911
l'm no time travel expert,

35:44.980 --> 35:47.039
but can't we just
call Voyager again?

35:47.116 --> 35:48.811
The past isn't going anywhere.

35:48.884 --> 35:50.010
That's not going to help

35:50.085 --> 35:51.882
if we don't know
what to tell them.

35:57.526 --> 35:59.653
The slipstream
kinetics look right.

35:59.728 --> 36:02.595
Hyperdimensional
progressions... perfect.

36:04.066 --> 36:06.796
Maybe it's
the deflector geometry.

36:13.142 --> 36:14.131
We're free.

36:14.243 --> 36:16.074
The EPS relays are overloading.

36:16.178 --> 36:18.976
Harry, we're looking
at a possible core breach

36:19.014 --> 36:20.675
in less than three minutes.

36:20.749 --> 36:22.808
How's it coming back there?

36:22.885 --> 36:25.046
Great! Just great!

36:25.120 --> 36:27.418
lt took me ten years
to make these corrections.

36:27.489 --> 36:28.888
l can't fix it in three minutes!

36:28.957 --> 36:30.117
You've got to try!

36:30.192 --> 36:33.252
l can't!
lt's not working.

36:33.328 --> 36:34.818
Why won't it work?!

36:37.232 --> 36:38.324
l killed them!

36:38.400 --> 36:39.492
Control yourself.

36:39.601 --> 36:41.091
They trusted me,
and l killed them!

36:41.203 --> 36:43.763
Mr. Kim! l didn't spend all
those years in an ice bucket,

36:43.872 --> 36:45.772
so l could listen
to you berate yourself.

36:45.841 --> 36:47.775
lf you want to wallow
in self-pity, fine!

36:47.843 --> 36:49.105
Do it on your own time!

36:49.178 --> 36:51.840
Don't you see?
History's repeating itself.

36:51.914 --> 36:55.042
l destroyed Voyager once,
and l'm doing it again!

36:55.117 --> 36:58.280
Somebody has got to knuckle
down and change history

36:58.353 --> 36:59.843
and that somebody is you.

36:59.922 --> 37:02.390
lt can't be done, Doc.
l told you.

37:02.524 --> 37:05.755
No, you told me, you can't
correct their phase variance.

37:05.828 --> 37:07.523
All right.
We have to accept that.

37:07.596 --> 37:09.689
But what about
sending Voyager a warning?

37:09.765 --> 37:13.201
ls there a way to get them
to abort the slipstream flight?

37:13.302 --> 37:15.463
Yes. Yes!

37:15.571 --> 37:17.004
l could send a phase correction

37:17.072 --> 37:19.040
which would disperse
the slipstream entirely.

37:19.107 --> 37:20.301
lf we can't get the crew home,

37:20.375 --> 37:21.672
at least
we can save their lives!

37:21.743 --> 37:24.837
Warning. Warp core breach
in 60 seconds.

37:24.913 --> 37:26.847
Can you eject the core?

37:26.915 --> 37:28.007
No.

37:28.083 --> 37:29.414
Emergency systems are off-line.

37:29.484 --> 37:31.042
La Forge to Delta Flyer.

37:31.119 --> 37:34.179
Our sensors are reading
an overload in your warp matrix.

37:34.256 --> 37:35.518
Lower your shields.

37:35.591 --> 37:37.081
We'll beam you out of there.

37:37.159 --> 37:41.323
l appreciate the offer, Captain,
but the answer's no.

37:41.463 --> 37:43.522
l suggest you get
to a safe distance.

37:43.599 --> 37:47.933
Warning. Warp core breach
in 45 seconds.

37:48.036 --> 37:50.732
Harry, now would be a good time.

37:52.374 --> 37:55.036
Mr. Kim!

37:55.110 --> 37:56.577
lt's losing power.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.874
Warning. Warp core breach
in 30 seconds.

38:00.949 --> 38:01.881
Your emitter.

38:01.950 --> 38:03.042
lt's got its own power source.

38:03.118 --> 38:04.050
Would it be enough?

38:04.119 --> 38:05.916
lt's our only chance.

38:07.022 --> 38:08.387
Glad you could join us, Doc.

38:08.457 --> 38:09.583
lt's been a pleasure.

38:11.960 --> 38:15.327
Warning. Warp core breach
in 15 seconds.

38:16.865 --> 38:19.390
Chakotay,
l'm giving this one more try.

38:19.568 --> 38:25.837
Warning. Warp core breach
in ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

38:25.908 --> 38:29.969
five, four, three, two, one...

38:30.045 --> 38:31.239
Yes!

38:37.519 --> 38:39.612
Captain, l am receiving
a transmission.

38:39.688 --> 38:41.315
l thought you said
the com-link was down.

38:41.390 --> 38:42.550
lt is.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.216
The signal is being routed

38:44.293 --> 38:46.261
through one
of my cranial implants.

38:46.328 --> 38:48.819
lt contains
a new set of phase corrections.

38:48.897 --> 38:51.058
Does Harry know how to access
your Borg systems?

38:51.133 --> 38:52.293
No.

38:52.367 --> 38:53.994
He must have figured out a way.

38:54.102 --> 38:55.501
Enter the corrections.

38:59.007 --> 39:01.669
Captain, the quantum drive
just went off-line.

39:01.743 --> 39:03.370
We're dropping to impulse.

39:03.445 --> 39:06.107
Captain,
we've lost the slipstream.

39:13.188 --> 39:14.849
The slipstream collapsed.

39:14.923 --> 39:17.391
We were thrown out right along
with Voyager.

39:17.526 --> 39:18.493
Our com system's back up.

39:18.560 --> 39:19.492
Delta Flyer to Voyager.

39:19.561 --> 39:20.653
What happened?

39:20.729 --> 39:23.163
You miscalculated, Harry.

39:23.231 --> 39:24.960
We entered
the exact phase corrections

39:25.033 --> 39:26.261
you sent to Seven of Nine.

39:26.368 --> 39:29.064
They shut down
the quantum drive.

39:29.171 --> 39:30.604
Captain,

39:30.672 --> 39:33.470
l didn't send any corrections
to Seven of Nine.

39:34.943 --> 39:36.410
She received a message

39:36.545 --> 39:39.036
through one
of her cranial implants.

39:39.114 --> 39:40.376
lt wasn't you?

39:40.449 --> 39:41.609
No, ma'am.

39:47.122 --> 39:49.181
Captain's Log, supplemental.

39:49.257 --> 39:51.851
Our slipstream flight
may have been brief,

39:51.927 --> 39:54.725
but it took nearly ten years
off our journey.

39:54.796 --> 39:57.856
l've given the order
to dismantle the quantum drive

39:57.933 --> 40:00.458
until the technology
can be perfected.

40:00.569 --> 40:04.505
Despite the setback, we have
a renewed sense of momentum.

40:04.573 --> 40:08.703
lt no longer seems a question
of if we get home, but when.

40:17.886 --> 40:19.080
At ease.

40:20.989 --> 40:22.718
Am l interrupting?

40:22.791 --> 40:24.383
No.

40:24.459 --> 40:26.927
l just came here to try
to figure things out.

40:26.995 --> 40:28.986
Phase corrections.

40:29.064 --> 40:32.124
The corrections
l sent you were wrong.

40:32.200 --> 40:33.258
lf you had used them,

40:33.368 --> 40:35.393
Voyager would have been
heavily damaged,

40:35.504 --> 40:37.529
maybe even destroyed.

40:37.639 --> 40:38.765
What l can't figure out

40:38.874 --> 40:42.037
is who sent the other phase
corrections to Seven of Nine.

40:42.110 --> 40:44.874
Looks like we've got
a guardian angel.

40:44.946 --> 40:46.880
Oh, l wish l could believe that.

40:46.948 --> 40:48.210
Believe it.

40:48.283 --> 40:50.376
His name is Harry Kim.

40:50.452 --> 40:52.010
Captain?

40:53.355 --> 40:56.381
Seven found a Starfleet
security code

40:56.458 --> 40:58.926
embedded in the transmission--

40:58.994 --> 41:00.859
yours.

41:00.929 --> 41:03.397
l'm telling you,
l didn't send it.

41:03.465 --> 41:05.456
Not yet.

41:05.600 --> 41:08.626
The transmission had
a temporal displacement.

41:08.737 --> 41:11.968
We believe it originated
from the future--

41:12.040 --> 41:14.167
ten, 20 years from now.

41:14.242 --> 41:16.005
We can't be sure.

41:18.613 --> 41:20.808
Wait a second.

41:20.882 --> 41:23.612
lf l sent a message
from the future

41:23.685 --> 41:25.949
and changed the past,

41:26.021 --> 41:30.924
then that future would
no longer exist, right?

41:30.992 --> 41:33.324
So... how could l
have sent the message

41:33.395 --> 41:34.828
in the first place?

41:34.896 --> 41:36.386
Am l making any sense?

41:36.531 --> 41:38.123
My advice in making sense

41:38.200 --> 41:40.327
of temporal paradoxes
is simple--

41:40.435 --> 41:42.665
don't even try.

41:42.771 --> 41:45.831
To me...

41:45.941 --> 41:48.774
all that matters
is that somewhere

41:48.844 --> 41:53.110
somehow... sometime,

41:53.181 --> 41:57.117
you'll come through for us.

41:57.185 --> 42:00.245
Well, if you won't
take it from me,

42:00.322 --> 42:01.983
take it from you.

42:05.393 --> 42:09.796
Seven found a log entry
encoded in the telemetry...

42:09.865 --> 42:13.699
from Harry Kim

42:13.802 --> 42:16.202
to Harry Kim.

42:43.198 --> 42:44.756
Hello, Harry.

42:44.833 --> 42:48.735
l don't have much time
so listen to me.

42:48.803 --> 42:54.639
15 years ago, l made a mistake
and 150 people died.

42:54.709 --> 42:58.668
l've spent every day since then
regretting that mistake,

42:58.747 --> 43:00.874
but if you're watching
this right now,

43:00.949 --> 43:04.009
that means
all of that's changed.

43:04.085 --> 43:05.882
You owe me one.

43:05.954 --> 43:09.617
Mr. Kim, your assistance,
please.

43:09.691 --> 43:11.522
Got to go.
