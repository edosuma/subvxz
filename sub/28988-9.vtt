WEBVTT

00:09.183 --> 00:12.099
- I wanted to thank you
for helping me with my mom.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.841
- Rebecca Adler from McDermott
called me today about you.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.279
I told her she was getting
the best lawyer I've ever seen.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.323
- I know that wasn't easy.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.064
- I love you.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.761
- What's the deal with
the mayor's trip to Seattle?

00:22.805 --> 00:24.459
They're saying he's doing
all kinds of dirty shit.

00:24.502 --> 00:26.156
- Bobby told me
to lay off McGann

00:26.200 --> 00:28.158
because he just made a deal
to put Ickaris on his land.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.073
He didn't tell you.
- He did not.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.858
There's a homeless encampment
growing outside of City Hall.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.730
Doesn't look very good
for your friend Bobby.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.514
- Yeah, I'm not in
the welfare business.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.603
- You have over 200 vacant
units in Streeterville.

00:38.647 --> 00:39.822
- I'm Carlos Salazar.

00:39.865 --> 00:40.866
- I spoke with the city
last night.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.651
They gave us an offer.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.392
- This is just a Band-Aid
to get you off the street.

00:44.435 --> 00:45.784
- You think we'll take
the scraps you're handing us

00:45.828 --> 00:47.221
and give up.
Let me tell you something,

00:47.264 --> 00:49.179
Mr. Mayor.
We aren't going anywhere!

00:49.223 --> 00:50.746
Not going anywhere!

00:50.789 --> 00:52.487
all:
Not going anywhere!

00:52.530 --> 00:54.576
- Nick was unsettled
by something McGann did.

00:54.619 --> 00:55.881
A grown man doesn't
go after another

00:55.925 --> 00:57.361
unless his back
is against the wall.

00:57.405 --> 00:59.102
- Did you tell Jessica Pearson
what you did?

00:59.146 --> 01:00.625
- No.
- Well, she figured it out,

01:00.669 --> 01:01.757
and she can take us all down.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.628
Put the gun down.

01:03.672 --> 01:06.066
- I killed someone
and I wanna confess.

01:08.459 --> 01:10.809
- They used
to call me "psycho."

01:10.853 --> 01:14.726
Like in a loving way,
you know, like...

01:14.770 --> 01:18.556
"Psycho" 'cause I-I nearly
killed some neighborhood kid

01:18.600 --> 01:20.863
when I was 14.

01:20.906 --> 01:23.909
Bashed his head in
with a brick.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.782
After I saw what I did
to that kid,

01:26.825 --> 01:29.176
I swore I would never
hurt anybody again.

01:29.219 --> 01:32.440
But he knew people were
scared of me and he used it.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.485
That's why when he wanted
to get rid of Diehl

01:34.529 --> 01:38.489
he told his buddy Pete to
have his flunky son do it.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.317
But he knew
it would go sideways.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.407
He didn't care.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.627
And now I found out
he's got a tape.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.150
I should've killed
him years ago.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.630
- Stop.
You shouldn't say anymore.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.284
- You--you're a lawyer, right?

01:50.327 --> 01:52.460
I can tell you anything.
This stays between us.

01:52.503 --> 01:53.722
- Of course it does,
but I'm not

01:53.765 --> 01:55.506
a criminal defense attorney,
Nick.

01:55.550 --> 01:57.247
- This is what McGann
has on us.

01:57.291 --> 02:00.294
I mean, I killed Diehl for him.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.383
And he's using it
to control Bobby.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.906
I-I don't know
where else to go.

02:03.949 --> 02:05.299
Don't you care?

02:05.342 --> 02:07.257
I-I know you care about Bobby.

02:07.301 --> 02:08.563
- I don't understand.
You've been living

02:08.606 --> 02:09.955
with this for 15 years?

02:09.999 --> 02:11.783
Why--
- I can't live with it anymore.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.655
Haven't you ever gotten
to a point where you can't

02:13.698 --> 02:15.831
live with something anymore?

02:18.225 --> 02:19.748
I'm going to the police.

02:19.791 --> 02:22.316
I don't care what you say.
I just want this over and done.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.231
I just thought that maybe--
maybe you could--

02:24.274 --> 02:25.797
- Okay, okay, okay, hey.
- Maybe if I came to you...

02:25.841 --> 02:27.408
- Okay, look at me.
- For some help--I don't know.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.279
- I will help you.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.894
all:
Not going anywhere!

02:38.636 --> 02:40.377
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Not going anywhere!

02:40.421 --> 02:43.206
- Ladies and gentlemen, please.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.382
If you don't clear the room
in an orderly fashion,

02:45.426 --> 02:47.428
the County Sheriffs
will start making arrests.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.822
- Let's head to City Hall, guys.
Come on, let's go.

02:57.786 --> 02:59.875
- Well, that must
be your cousin.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.572
I thought you were gonna try
to talk some sense into her.

03:01.616 --> 03:02.747
- Well, you told me

03:02.791 --> 03:04.662
Carlos Salazar was
the real threat.

03:04.706 --> 03:07.230
- Yeah, well, apparently she's
the one they're listening to.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.666
And I'm fighting
a war on two fronts.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.320
- There's no reason
for a fight at all

03:10.364 --> 03:12.540
when your friend has
200 empty apartments on Huron.

03:12.583 --> 03:13.802
- God damn it, I told you
we won't be visiting that.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.760
- Can I say something?
- What?

03:15.804 --> 03:16.848
- Give them what they want.

03:16.892 --> 03:18.589
- And what does that mean?

03:18.633 --> 03:21.026
- It means go back there
and tell them you're committed

03:21.070 --> 03:23.028
to a 21st Century Housing plan,

03:23.072 --> 03:25.857
safe, permanent housing to
replace the original projects.

03:25.901 --> 03:28.817
- So lie to their faces,
while I'm on camera.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.688
Sounds like a great campaign ad

03:30.732 --> 03:32.995
for any one of the hundred
people trying to take my job.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.953
- I'm not saying lie.
I'm saying make a commitment.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.869
- We don't have the votes
or the money, Derrick.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.349
- You haven't even tried.

03:39.393 --> 03:40.872
- You picked a hell of a night

03:40.916 --> 03:42.570
to start binge watching
your favorite show.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.441
- Are you alone?

03:44.485 --> 03:45.834
- I am now.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.401
- Nick D'Amato's sitting
in my living room.

03:47.444 --> 03:48.706
- Oh, thank God.

03:48.750 --> 03:49.794
The mayor needs some good news.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.318
- No, you can't tell him.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.363
- Keri, he's been going
out of his mind.

03:53.407 --> 03:54.756
He's gonna want to know.

03:54.799 --> 03:56.714
- Can you just get
to my place now, please?

03:56.758 --> 03:58.716
- Do you have any idea
what's going on down here?

03:58.760 --> 04:01.502
- I do, and trust me,
this is worse.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.375
- Things settling down
out there?

04:05.419 --> 04:07.551
- Well, no one's in cuffs yet,
if that's what you mean.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.292
Thanks.
- Well don't thank me.

04:09.336 --> 04:12.034
City Hall's not our court.
Across the street is though.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.427
- What's your point?

04:13.470 --> 04:14.689
- Someone threw a bottle

04:14.732 --> 04:16.430
and hit one of my men
earlier tonight.

04:16.473 --> 04:17.909
12 stitches in his head.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.824
- Someone from
the demonstration?

04:19.868 --> 04:21.739
- Does it matter?
- Yeah, actually, it does.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.872
- Oh, come on, Bobby.
- No, you come on.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.656
You want us to just sweep
those people out like trash

04:25.700 --> 04:26.918
because your men
have built-in risk?

04:26.962 --> 04:28.572
Tell them to do their jobs.

04:28.616 --> 04:31.009
- Okay, my men,
they're happy to do their job,

04:31.053 --> 04:33.751
but whenever they're in a line,
they're seen as a threat.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.753
- I'm not pulling them.
- I'm not asking you to.

04:35.797 --> 04:39.061
But this isn't just about
protecting a demonstration.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.803
It's becoming a public health
and safety issue.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.892
- It's also a political one.
- Bingo.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.024
- You have a job
to protect those people, Chuck.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.853
- I've got a job to protect
all of your voters, Bobby.

04:48.897 --> 04:51.813
- Look, Chuck, I just need
a little time to settle this.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.467
You go in there
with 20 cruisers,

04:53.510 --> 04:54.903
it's gonna go
from bad to worse.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.992
- I can try
and buy you some time,

04:57.035 --> 04:59.516
but the clock's ticking.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.005
- Don't go inside yet.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.529
- I don't plan to until you
tell me what I'm walking into.

05:12.573 --> 05:13.965
- Are you familiar
with the union boss

05:14.009 --> 05:15.619
who disappeared in '03?

05:15.663 --> 05:17.447
- Tommy Diehl.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.449
- Nick wants to confess
to killing him.

05:19.493 --> 05:20.972
He says that
he did it for McGann,

05:21.016 --> 05:23.584
that it was self-defense,
and that that's what McGann

05:23.627 --> 05:25.150
is holding over them.

05:25.194 --> 05:28.676
Apparently there's
a tape proving it.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.721
You don't look surprised.

05:30.765 --> 05:32.593
- That he killed him
or that he wants to confess?

05:32.636 --> 05:33.985
- I don't have time
to play 20 questions, Jessica.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.596
Do you want to help me or not?

05:35.639 --> 05:36.988
- He came to you because
he needs an attorney.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.642
- Jessica, I--
I'm leaving City Hall

05:38.686 --> 05:40.470
because I don't wanna
be a part of this anymore.

05:40.514 --> 05:41.732
I can't.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.473
I already told Bobby
I'm quitting.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.823
I need him out of my apartment.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.869
I'll talk to him.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.610
- Okay, uh, he doesn't
know I called you.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.002
He thinks I'm out
here getting food.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.917
- Is there anything else
I need to know?

05:52.961 --> 05:55.355
- Yeah.
He has a gun.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.358
- Wonderful.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.209
- What's she doing here?

06:24.253 --> 06:25.863
- Let Jessica handle this.
It's what she does.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.952
- I told you everything.
- Yes, you did,

06:27.996 --> 06:30.215
and I can't repeat a word of it
or I'd lose my license.

06:30.259 --> 06:32.174
- And what about her?
She's got no license to lose.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.480
- Nick, please--
- I should never have come here.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.003
- Please, listen--
- It's okay, Keri.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.178
Let me talk to him.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.962
- I'm not fucking
talking to you.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.399
- I knew when you left
we were headed down this road.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.096
- Yeah, you don't know shit.
- I did know.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.402
And I meant it when I said
I want to help you.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.099
- Don't bullshit me.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.493
You have been nothing but
trouble since you got here.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.059
And before then, we--we were--
- What?

06:48.103 --> 06:49.191
Fine?

06:49.234 --> 06:51.498
You and your brother

06:51.541 --> 06:54.326
have been blackmailed
for 15 years.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.198
I hardly call that fine.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.200
And if you're really
trying to protect him,

06:58.243 --> 06:59.549
you can't just walk
into a police station

06:59.593 --> 07:00.681
and you certainly
can't do it now.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.030
- This is about me and McGann.

07:02.073 --> 07:03.379
This has nothing
to do with Bobby.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.642
- Nick, wake up.
You open that Pandora's Box,

07:05.686 --> 07:07.339
I guarantee it's gonna
come back around on him.

07:07.383 --> 07:09.298
He has major liability.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.604
- You don't know that.
- I do.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.519
You do this now,
while he's dealing with

07:12.562 --> 07:15.565
this tidal wave at City Hall,
you won't be protecting him.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.176
You'll be feeding him
to the lions.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.396
- I'm gonna confess.
You can't talk me out of it.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.920
- Oh--okay, no.
I'm not gonna try.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.009
I'm not, but you gotta
keep Keri out of this.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.707
And you need to do it right.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.928
- You can trust her.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.106
You can.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.153
- Good night, Daddy.
I love you.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.415
- I love you too, Monkey.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.069
Put Mommy back on the phone?

07:41.112 --> 07:43.550
- Mom, Daddy wants
to talk to you.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.552
- Thank you, sweetie.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.075
Yeah?

07:47.118 --> 07:48.555
- Hey, I'm not coming
home tonight.

07:48.598 --> 07:51.035
- Really.
This is your plan from now on?

07:51.079 --> 07:52.123
- What?

07:52.167 --> 07:53.516
- I'm just asking if this

07:53.560 --> 07:55.213
is the way that
it's going to be.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.954
- Things are blowing up here.
I just wanted--

07:56.998 --> 07:59.217
- I thought we were done
with the lying, Bobby.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.089
- Jesus, Steph.
Turn on the news.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.004
- You can't make it home.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.267
Okay, I get it.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.138
- You're still my wife.

08:09.053 --> 08:12.013
We can talk about that
when things aren't blowing up.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.145
- Are you filing for divorce?

08:14.189 --> 08:17.018
- I said we can talk
about that later.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.499
- God damn it.

08:19.542 --> 08:20.717
If you're gonna play games,
maybe I won't--

08:20.761 --> 08:22.153
- Games?
- That's right, games.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.241
File or don't file.

08:23.285 --> 08:24.373
I'm not gonna let you use it

08:24.416 --> 08:26.114
to lead me around by the balls.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.029
- You're lashing out
at the wrong person.

08:28.072 --> 08:32.468
I am not the one who has been
neutering you all these years.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.525
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.745
- Did you hear about the
shitstorm over at City Council?

08:48.789 --> 08:50.573
- I did.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.444
- Did you know it was Jessica's
cousin that's ringleader?

08:52.488 --> 08:54.490
- I do.
- Did I do something wrong?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.014
- No, no, I'm just trying
to finish up so I can go home.

08:57.058 --> 08:58.625
My dad and I have a lot
of paperwork to fill out

08:58.668 --> 09:00.148
for my mom's hearing.

09:00.191 --> 09:01.671
- That almost sounded true.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.412
- That is true.

09:03.455 --> 09:06.154
- And this has nothing
to do with that kiss?

09:06.197 --> 09:08.199
- What kiss?
- What kiss?

09:08.243 --> 09:10.724
I-I didn't kiss you.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.378
- Your lips, my face.
I call that a kiss.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.337
- I'd call it a peck.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.512
- Where's Ms. Pearson?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.079
She's not here.

09:18.122 --> 09:19.776
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.604
She didn't tell me.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.563
- I need you.

09:29.525 --> 09:31.179
You think Karen Chao
will support that

09:31.222 --> 09:32.572
Permanent Housing Project
you're always going on about?

09:32.615 --> 09:34.182
- I think she's open to it.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.662
Depends on what
you're willing to give up.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.315
- Set a meeting with her
for tomorrow morning.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.708
Find out what she wants.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.623
- Meeting with the
City Council President.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.321
Isn't that something your
Chief of Staff should handle?

09:43.365 --> 09:44.801
- Stop wrangling for
a promotion, get it done.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.542
- And will you be part
of said meeting?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.500
- No, I have the groundbreaking
for Ickaris tomorrow.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.198
- Are you shitting me?
We're at DEFCON 1

09:50.241 --> 09:51.591
and you're still rolling out
the red carpet for that guy?

09:51.634 --> 09:53.201
- I'm rolling out
the red carpet

09:53.244 --> 09:54.463
because it's a means to an end.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.638
- You said McGann wasn't
on the hook

09:55.682 --> 09:56.639
for replacement housing.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.249
- You heard Ms. Pearson.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.425
He's got 200 empty apartments
in Streeterville.

10:00.469 --> 10:01.731
- So you're gonna go out
there and flat out lie?

10:01.775 --> 10:04.386
- No.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.431
I'm making a commitment.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.393
- This should be warm enough,

10:11.436 --> 10:13.569
but if you need another
blanket just let me know.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.353
- Doesn't matter.
I can't sleep.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.704
You need some rest, Nick.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.575
- I can't.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.621
- In that case...

10:21.664 --> 10:25.450
why don't you write down
everything you told Keri and...

10:25.494 --> 10:27.496
all the stuff
you didn't tell her.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.718
- You want my confession?

10:31.761 --> 10:34.416
We not only need to make sure

10:34.459 --> 10:36.592
your story holds water...

10:36.636 --> 10:39.290
we need to account
for what Bobby knows

10:39.334 --> 10:40.509
and when he found out.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.337
- And what do you need it for?

10:44.556 --> 10:46.428
You really don't trust anybody,
do you?

10:46.471 --> 10:47.777
- It's because
everybody I've known

10:47.821 --> 10:50.650
has either turned against me
or let me down.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.436
- Your brother hasn't.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.612
- No.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.528
He's the only one.
He, uh, saved--

11:03.271 --> 11:06.622
I know you don't trust me, Nick.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.452
But you're a fool if you turn
yourself in without a lawyer.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.846
And the lawyer we get you
might not have

11:12.889 --> 11:14.282
Bobby's best interests at
heart.

11:14.325 --> 11:15.805
- Like you, you mean?

11:17.764 --> 11:19.853
- You know what?

11:19.896 --> 11:22.769
I wouldn't think of taking
your statement right now.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.422
You need a good night's rest.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.686
And if you still don't
trust me in the morning,

11:26.729 --> 11:28.688
there's the door.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.782
But there's one thing
I need tonight.

11:35.825 --> 11:37.740
You can't be in my home
with a gun.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.394
- Fuck you.

11:39.437 --> 11:41.352
- If that's how you feel,
you can leave right now.

11:43.790 --> 11:46.444
- I'm not gonna hurt you,
Jessica.

11:46.488 --> 11:49.317
- It's not my safety
I'm worried about.

11:51.319 --> 11:54.757
Please, for Bobby.

11:54.801 --> 11:58.239
You say you're doing
this for him.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.850
If something were
to happen to you...

12:15.735 --> 12:18.563
Thank you.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.788
- Welcome.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.094
Before we officially
break ground

12:27.137 --> 12:28.922
on this amazing new project,

12:28.965 --> 12:31.054
Mayor Novak would like
to say a few words.

12:34.144 --> 12:36.581
- Thank you, Derrick.
Good morning.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.801
As you know,
I recently flew out to Seattle

12:38.845 --> 12:41.021
to convince
Ickaris CEO David Nilsson

12:41.064 --> 12:43.545
to build his headquarters
on this sight

12:43.588 --> 12:45.982
instead of the previously
planned Lincoln Yards.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.810
And I told him why.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.551
Point blank.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.859
I promised to bring jobs
to the South Side.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.036
Now David was concerned
that his company not

12:56.079 --> 12:59.822
be the reason
for less affordable housing.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.825
So I assured him
that Pat McGann and I

13:02.869 --> 13:05.654
were as committed as he is
to fixing that problem,

13:05.697 --> 13:08.962
and that we could find a way
to both bring jobs here

13:09.005 --> 13:11.225
and not abandon
our neediest residents.

13:11.268 --> 13:15.055
So, when Pat saw
what was going on

13:15.098 --> 13:16.839
outside City Hall,

13:16.883 --> 13:20.843
he called me last night
and he donated

13:20.887 --> 13:23.846
over 200 apartments
on Huron Street

13:23.890 --> 13:25.848
as temporary homes

13:25.892 --> 13:28.677
for those displaced
by the redevelopment.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.766
That's what Chicago is.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.813
We're all in this together.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.685
Thank you, Pat.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.736
- You stupid son of a bitch,

13:44.780 --> 13:45.999
I can pull out and
embarrass you, you know.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.696
- No, you won't do that.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.089
You're the one who made
the promise, not me.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.873
- You have any idea what
putting those people

13:50.917 --> 13:52.614
in that neighborhood
is gonna do?

13:52.657 --> 13:53.876
- "Those people"?
Careful, Pat, you don't want

13:53.920 --> 13:55.356
to be mistaken for a racist.

13:55.399 --> 13:56.879
-  I'm a realist.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.663
Now forget what
it's gonna cost me.

13:58.707 --> 14:01.188
You're trading bad optics
for a potential riot.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.233
- Jesus, grow up.
It's not 1968.

14:03.277 --> 14:04.931
- What Chicago
are you living in?

14:04.974 --> 14:07.237
It's still two cities.
And I swear to God--

14:07.281 --> 14:09.022
- Swear to God, what?

14:09.065 --> 14:10.937
You're gonna keep your word

14:10.980 --> 14:12.721
and put those people
in your apartments

14:12.764 --> 14:14.897
or I'm gonna blow everything
to fucking pieces.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.900
- You're self-destructing,
kiddo.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.947
- Yeah, that's what happens
when you got nothing to lose.

14:24.254 --> 14:27.040
All right.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.738
Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

14:29.781 --> 14:33.046
- One, two, three.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.749
- Feeling inspired?

14:40.792 --> 14:42.316
-  You said you
wanted everything in writing,

14:42.359 --> 14:44.666
so this is everything.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.015
- Well, I also need
to know what's on

14:46.059 --> 14:48.148
this tape Keri mentioned.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.759
- It's all here.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.239
- All right, I'll look at it.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.763
But just remember,
even if you've dotted all

14:54.806 --> 14:56.808
the I's and crossed
all the T's,

14:56.852 --> 14:58.985
we can't just walk
into the police--

14:59.028 --> 15:00.334
- Until everything's in order

15:00.377 --> 15:02.249
and the timing makes sense
for Bobby.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.338
I got it.
I got it.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.037
Thank you.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.213
- I haven't done anything yet.
- I mean for last night.

15:10.257 --> 15:13.390
Truth is, I've been
in a pretty dark place

15:13.434 --> 15:18.047
these last few days
and you were right to, um...

15:18.091 --> 15:19.744
I just need this off my back.

15:19.788 --> 15:21.224
So...

15:21.268 --> 15:22.965
thank you for doing this.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.880
- You're welcome.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.448
- Can I ask you
for one more thing?

15:27.491 --> 15:30.799
And it is not easy for me.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.366
- You can always ask.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.803
- I haven't showered in awhile.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.892
- I noticed.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.983
I can go back to my place
if you're not comfortable.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.072
- I promised Keri
that I would handle this

15:43.116 --> 15:45.161
and you need someone
to look after you, so...

15:48.034 --> 15:49.209
- Okay.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.431
- Yep.
Towels are under the sink.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.348
- Hey, just, uh, pull up
here on the left, please.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.758
Ah, thank you.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.983
Danny, what are
you doing here?

16:26.202 --> 16:28.117
What's going on, Danny?

16:28.161 --> 16:31.207
- Can we go somewhere and talk?

16:34.950 --> 16:37.257
- Thank you for waiting,
Miss Cook.

16:37.300 --> 16:41.217
Can I call you Angela?
- Can I call you Bobby?

16:41.261 --> 16:43.741
- You have caused me
quite a headache, Angela.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.917
- We were just fine
living where we were.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.311
- I'm sorry about North Park.

16:48.355 --> 16:50.835
But I agreed to redevelop
it because the original plan

16:50.879 --> 16:53.186
set aside 35%
for public housing.

16:53.229 --> 16:55.014
-  Original plans
are always bullshit.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.407
If I knew that, I find it hard
to believe you didn't.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.888
But there's nothing more we can
do about that now, is there?

16:59.931 --> 17:01.759
- About the past?
No.

17:01.803 --> 17:04.066
But about your future,
there is.

17:04.110 --> 17:07.026
Have a seat.
I want to show you something.

17:09.463 --> 17:12.205
The original developer
owns three high-rises

17:12.248 --> 17:13.989
in Streeterville.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.469
As of this morning,

17:15.512 --> 17:16.992
he's committing over 200 units

17:17.036 --> 17:18.820
to you and your
fellow demonstrators.

17:18.863 --> 17:20.865
Nearby shopping, fresh markets,

17:20.909 --> 17:22.563
good schools, low-crime.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.304
We heard you.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.436
You deserve better
than the existing shelters.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.221
- Mm-hmm.

17:28.264 --> 17:30.005
And he's just gonna let us
all live there for free?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.963
- For up to three months.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.791
- Look, Angela.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.184
I saw your children out there.

17:35.228 --> 17:36.490
Conditions are only
gonna deteriorate.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.231
This is no place for them.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.146
- And neither is the shelter
on 71st, which is exactly

17:40.189 --> 17:41.973
where we'll end up
when the clock runs out.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.584
- I'm working with
the City Council right now

17:43.627 --> 17:45.194
to find a permanent solution.

17:45.238 --> 17:46.587
-  Carlos Salazar
said you'd say that.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.546
- Carlos isn't here.
You and I are.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.287
Work with me.
I'm willing to--

17:51.331 --> 17:53.159
I'm willing to make whatever
sacrifices are needed.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.117
- Sacrifices?
No offense, Mr. Mayor,

17:55.161 --> 17:57.424
but I gave up
my home and my job.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.253
What did you have to give up?
A Tuesday night?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.824
- Angela.
Angela.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.915
- So, what do you think?

18:12.526 --> 18:14.310
I think...

18:14.354 --> 18:17.966
if you're going
to confess to murder,

18:18.009 --> 18:20.360
then you need to make sure
everything makes sense.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.926
- I didn't murder anybody.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.145
It was self-defense.
You read it.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.886
- Why didn't you
go to the police?

18:24.929 --> 18:27.236
- What are you doing?
- I'm preparing you.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.196
Why didn't you
go to the police?

18:30.239 --> 18:32.067
- Because I went to his office
with a baseball bat.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.591
- To scare him, and then,
"things got out of hand."

18:34.635 --> 18:36.593
- That's right.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.421
- He pulled a knife on you,

18:38.465 --> 18:41.294
grabbed your throat,
scratched your face.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.643
- So what?

18:42.686 --> 18:44.471
- That's evidence
of a struggle.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.342
- I did time in juvie.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.996
You think they
were gonna believe me?

18:48.039 --> 18:49.954
I was a scared kid.
- Who killed a man.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.608
A big man.

18:51.652 --> 18:55.177
Tommy Diehl was...
200, 220?

18:55.221 --> 18:57.048
- Yeah, that didn't matter
once the bat hit him.

18:58.615 --> 19:01.314
- What about afterwards?
- What about it?

19:01.357 --> 19:03.272
- How'd you get rid
of the body?

19:03.316 --> 19:05.144
- I dumped him in the lake.
It's all right there.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.971
- No, it isn't.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.147
What dock was it?

19:08.190 --> 19:10.018
What time of day
did you get there?

19:10.061 --> 19:12.890
How does a man who's
160 pounds soaking wet

19:12.934 --> 19:15.371
do all of that by himself?

19:15.415 --> 19:17.460
I know you had help.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.027
You weren't alone.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.202
- I don't
believe this shit.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.421
- You're a cop, Nick.

19:21.464 --> 19:22.639
You know what
they're gonna do to you.

19:22.683 --> 19:23.640
They're gonna put
you in a box until

19:23.684 --> 19:25.076
you get your story straight.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.600
- So let 'em.
I'm confessing.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.558
- To what?
For who?

19:28.602 --> 19:30.647
- I am not lying.

19:30.691 --> 19:34.912
- You stood in the lobby
of City Hall and told me,

19:34.956 --> 19:36.566
if I thought you
were capable of murder

19:36.610 --> 19:39.526
to get myself another driver.

19:39.569 --> 19:40.962
You remember saying that?

19:41.005 --> 19:43.138
Were you lying then?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.574
- Yes.

19:46.663 --> 19:49.536
- You seemed
awfully convincing.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.238
Mr. Mayor?

19:56.282 --> 19:58.327
I was just about to call you.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.373
- Now I'm waist-deep in this.
Where the hell are you?

20:00.416 --> 20:03.114
- I'm handling a situation.
- Yeah, well, handle it later.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.464
Your cousin's gone
full activist on me.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.161
I need you here now.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.951
- Do you know when
Keri's coming back?

20:13.995 --> 20:15.475
- Miss Allen called
in sick today.

20:28.270 --> 20:32.274
- I hope you get what you want.
-  Yeah, me too.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.798
- Thank you, Yoli.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.366
- You're welcome.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.412
And, uh, nice to meet you.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.804
- You too.

20:44.765 --> 20:47.420
- Temperature's supposed
to drop tonight.

20:47.463 --> 20:49.291
- Thank you for
the weather forecast.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.814
We'll be fine.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.990
- You know, the mayor pulled
a lot of strings

20:53.034 --> 20:55.689
to get enough housing for you
and everyone else out there.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.386
- It was a half measure.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.997
- You know what, Angela,
you keep biting your nose

21:00.041 --> 21:01.825
to spite your face,
you won't be able to breathe.

21:01.869 --> 21:03.523
- We'll stay through
the first snow if we have to.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.699
- You're acting like woman
who has nothing to lose.

21:05.742 --> 21:07.701
- I have nothing to lose.

21:10.443 --> 21:12.358
- You lost your job.

21:15.709 --> 21:18.929
It wasn't even
because I missed a shift.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.322
It was the fact
that I took food

21:20.366 --> 21:21.584
and said no one helped me.

21:21.628 --> 21:22.933
Food they were gonna throw out.

21:22.977 --> 21:25.719
- Come back.
Stay with me.

21:25.762 --> 21:28.548
- I can't put my needs
over the big picture.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.637
Look, Carlos said that
if we just stay committed--

21:30.680 --> 21:32.552
- Carlos is a politician.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.467
His commitment to the cause

21:34.510 --> 21:38.340
ended as soon as I offered
him the vacant alderman seat.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.821
- So that's what you did.

21:40.864 --> 21:42.823
- I'm sorry.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.564
-  You know what,
look, it's getting late.

21:44.607 --> 21:45.782
I gotta pick up the boys.

21:45.826 --> 21:47.349
- Angela, wait.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.528
There's something I wanna
show you before you go.

21:52.572 --> 21:53.921
- If it means
going back to the mayor

21:53.964 --> 21:55.879
asking for a payoff,
it's a waste of time.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.838
- I don't need him for this.

22:03.844 --> 22:05.411
- Hey, do you
wanna help me

22:05.454 --> 22:06.934
with this affordable housing
plan?

22:06.977 --> 22:08.936
- Oh, I-I would love to,

22:08.979 --> 22:10.894
but I just have a ton of work
to do for Jessica

22:10.938 --> 22:12.418
and I'm trying
to get out of here

22:12.461 --> 22:14.071
so I can meet my friends
from Streets and San.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.596
- And last night
it was paperwork to file

22:16.639 --> 22:18.380
for your mom's hearing.
- What?

22:18.424 --> 22:19.773
- You do know
what you're doing, right?

22:19.816 --> 22:21.383
I mean it's obvious,
you can't even look me

22:21.427 --> 22:22.732
in the eyes since that kiss.

22:22.776 --> 22:24.952
- You are so, so hung up
on this kiss thing.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.562
- It messes with a guy's head,

22:26.606 --> 22:27.911
you know.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.652
- Derrick, we work together.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.480
- Ah, so you do have
feelings for me.

22:31.524 --> 22:32.916
It's just that you
don't want to act on it

22:32.960 --> 22:34.570
because we work together.
- Derrick...

22:34.614 --> 22:35.832
- I mean, I can respect that.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.007
I just want the truth.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.444
Let's talk this through.

22:38.487 --> 22:40.446
- Well, the truth is
it was just a peck.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.409
- Here, try it out.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.846
- What are you doing, Jessica?

22:49.890 --> 22:52.849
- It's yours, if you want it.

22:54.808 --> 22:57.332
- What do you mean it's mine?

22:57.376 --> 22:59.987
- You live in the 54th,
don't you?

23:00.030 --> 23:02.598
There's a vacant alderman seat.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.426
The mayor has
four days to fill it

23:04.470 --> 23:06.602
and I'm offering it to you.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.604
- I thought you offered
that seat to Carlos Salazar.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.476
- Carlos showed me
his true colors

23:10.519 --> 23:12.434
when he abandoned you
for power.

23:12.478 --> 23:14.958
Is that the kind of person you
want representing your ward?

23:15.002 --> 23:17.091
- And now you're asking me
to do the same.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.963
- You showed me your true colors
by standing up to the mayor.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.487
- What happens
when Carlos finds out

23:21.530 --> 23:22.836
you broke your promise?

23:22.879 --> 23:25.055
- Let me worry
about Carlos Salazar.

23:30.583 --> 23:33.629
- This is crazy.

23:33.673 --> 23:36.066
I'm not qualified.

23:36.110 --> 23:39.592
- Everything you've done
has put you in this position.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.985
Your work at the hospital,
as a mother,

23:42.029 --> 23:43.813
your involvement in the church,

23:43.857 --> 23:45.859
and now this.

23:45.902 --> 23:48.992
Everyone out there
was listening to you,

23:49.036 --> 23:50.559
and they were listening to you

23:50.603 --> 23:53.780
because you're
a part of their community.

23:53.823 --> 23:56.609
- You're a natural leader,
Angela.

23:56.652 --> 23:57.784
Look what you've done.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.568
You have the Mayor of Chicago

23:59.612 --> 24:01.962
running scared.

24:02.005 --> 24:04.617
You want to set
an example for your boys?

24:04.660 --> 24:06.401
Do more than protest.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.055
Take a seat at the table.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.973
- And in exchange?

24:13.016 --> 24:14.627
Clearly you're doing this
to move the tents.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.672
- No strings.
Come tomorrow.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.761
You're the only name
I'm submitting to the mayor,

24:18.805 --> 24:22.852
whether you're camped
across the street or not.

24:22.896 --> 24:25.594
- You lied to Carlos.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.727
How do I know you're
not doing the same to me?

24:29.032 --> 24:32.122
- Carlos isn't family.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.168
You are.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.085
- McDermott, Will, and Emery.

24:38.128 --> 24:40.696
- Hi, Keri Allen
for Rebecca Adler, please.

24:40.740 --> 24:42.437
- One moment.

24:43.656 --> 24:46.223
- Hi, are you ready
to put a ring on it?

24:46.267 --> 24:48.704
- I was thinking two-carat,
emerald-cut,

24:48.748 --> 24:50.532
but I don't wanna be too showy.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.187
-  I think that
we can arrange that.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.494
Are you sure?

24:55.537 --> 24:57.887
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm sure.

24:57.931 --> 24:59.541
- I'm so glad.
Okay.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.891
Why don't you take
the next two weeks

25:01.935 --> 25:03.240
and get things
wrapped up there--

25:03.284 --> 25:04.720
- I actually don't
need two weeks.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.113
I've already spoken
to the mayor.

25:06.156 --> 25:07.810
- That is
fantastic news, Keri.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.551
We are so happy to have you.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.684
Then how's Monday?

25:11.727 --> 25:14.904
- Monday's great.
I will see you then.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.844
- Jeff...
I can explain--

25:59.079 --> 26:01.385
- If this is about
Nick being upstairs,

26:01.429 --> 26:03.387
I-I can explain that.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.607
- I got pinched.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.914
- What does that mean?

26:09.306 --> 26:11.221
- I flew in
to surprise you this morning

26:11.265 --> 26:13.572
and when I got back my friend
from Justice and the FBI

26:13.615 --> 26:15.443
were waiting for me.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.318
I'm so sorry.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.103
- You're sorry?

26:24.974 --> 26:28.195
I have been stuck in a room
in the Federal building

26:28.238 --> 26:30.240
for the past ten goddamn hours,

26:30.284 --> 26:32.199
trying to convince
the government that I had

26:32.242 --> 26:34.027
absolutely nothing to do
with whatever it is

26:34.070 --> 26:36.943
you're messed up in,
and you're sorry?

26:38.466 --> 26:41.687
The file you gave me came

26:41.730 --> 26:44.951
from your friend at Justice.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.997
That means he's in
as much trouble as you are.

26:48.041 --> 26:51.174
- He didn't give me
that file, Jessica.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.350
- What?

26:53.394 --> 26:56.440
- He didn't give it to me.

26:56.484 --> 26:59.139
I took it.

26:59.182 --> 27:00.967
- Oh, my God...

27:01.010 --> 27:03.404
- You said I didn't
have your back.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.194
- I never meant for you
to be a part of this.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.674
- Well, I am.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.720
And now I can't even
walk into my own living room

27:14.763 --> 27:17.461
and know that
it's safe to talk.

27:17.505 --> 27:18.680
- You think it's bugged?

27:18.724 --> 27:21.248
- I don't--Jess, I don't know.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.120
But based on what
they already know,

27:24.164 --> 27:27.123
I guarantee your phone
and office are.

27:27.167 --> 27:31.127
And probably the entire
fifth floor at City Hall.

27:31.171 --> 27:33.173
- No, they need cause
to tap my phones.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.783
- Don't you get it, Jess?

27:34.827 --> 27:39.135
You are under investigation.

27:39.179 --> 27:42.530
They are watching
every single thing that you do.

27:46.273 --> 27:47.578
- I don't wanna hear it.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.319
I'm getting--I'm getting
hourly updates.

27:49.363 --> 27:50.799
Everything's calm out there.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.062
- Have you talked
to Sheriff Layne?

27:53.106 --> 27:55.195
- I haven't talked to that
asshole in two years, why?

27:55.238 --> 27:57.023
- Well, there's a rumor
going around that he's gonna

27:57.066 --> 27:59.634
take matters into his own hand
first thing in the morning.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.722
- What the hell
are you talking about?

28:00.766 --> 28:02.332
He doesn't have jurisdiction.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.334
- Legally he can send
his men wherever he wants.

28:06.249 --> 28:07.729
- He's after my job, isn't he?

28:07.773 --> 28:09.513
- Okay, look, I don't know
if he's running or not,

28:09.557 --> 28:10.732
but if his guys go in there

28:10.776 --> 28:12.429
like some kind of
military force--

28:12.473 --> 28:14.040
- I'll lose the black vote
and I'll look weak.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.345
I'll lose everyone.

28:15.389 --> 28:17.217
- Let my guys do it tonight.

28:19.262 --> 28:21.525
Oh, God damn it.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.092
- Bobby, it is your best move.

28:23.136 --> 28:24.267
And that way it looks
like you are still

28:24.311 --> 28:26.574
calling the shots.

28:26.617 --> 28:30.143
- Look, don't do anything till
after I make a statement.

28:30.186 --> 28:31.666
I don't want it looking
like an ambush.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.494
- Yeah.

28:38.107 --> 28:39.456
- You tell Derrick I need him.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.415
Now.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.373
- What do they know?

28:43.417 --> 28:45.245
- They didn't exactly walk
me through their case notes.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.290
- Well, you spent ten hours
with them.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.162
You can tell
by the questions they asked.

28:49.205 --> 28:50.685
- Why don't you tell me
everything that you know

28:50.729 --> 28:52.382
and I'll confirm
if they asked me about it?

28:52.426 --> 28:53.732
- Excuse me?

28:53.775 --> 28:55.255
- You said this has
nothing to do

28:55.298 --> 28:56.473
with that plaintiff
who was shot, right?

28:56.517 --> 28:58.562
So what is it about?

29:01.740 --> 29:04.351
- I can't.
- Why not?

29:04.394 --> 29:06.527
Because you don't want to
or because you think I flipped?

29:06.570 --> 29:07.876
- Jeff...

29:07.920 --> 29:09.138
- Wanna see if I'm
wearing a wire, Jessica?

29:09.182 --> 29:10.444
Go right ahead.

29:10.487 --> 29:13.621
- There's no marital privilege
between us.

29:13.664 --> 29:16.189
They can force you
to testify against me.

29:16.232 --> 29:19.235
- Force me, but not you, right?

29:19.279 --> 29:22.586
- You're the one
who has something to lose.

29:22.630 --> 29:25.764
You're a partner at a law firm.

29:27.287 --> 29:28.897
- For now.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.685
- All right, c'mon,
what do you got?

29:34.729 --> 29:36.383
I got the whole
press room waiting for me.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.863
- It's fine.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.603
- Your enthusiasm
is overwhelming.

29:39.647 --> 29:40.735
- What do you want me to say?

29:40.779 --> 29:42.258
- I want my press secretary

29:42.302 --> 29:43.782
to help me craft a statement.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.523
- Okay, for starters,
who're you talking to?

29:46.567 --> 29:48.438
- I'm talking
to the people of Chicago.

29:48.482 --> 29:50.266
- Not the ones you're about
to kick to the curb.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.399
"While demonstrators have
raised important issues,

29:52.442 --> 29:53.879
"the health and safety of those
working in the downtown area

29:53.922 --> 29:55.532
must also be taken
into consideration"?

29:55.576 --> 29:56.620
This is your way of
assuring the white voters

29:56.664 --> 29:58.231
you're not a bleeding heart.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.580
- That's my way
of telling the homeless

29:59.623 --> 30:00.581
I heard what they want.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.452
- Then give them hope.

30:02.496 --> 30:03.845
You're not even mentioning
an affordable housing project.

30:03.889 --> 30:05.542
- Yeah, because
there isn't one.

30:05.586 --> 30:06.892
- For now, but the
Council President's willing

30:06.935 --> 30:08.632
to push for one
when the time is right.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.243
- I'm not promising
something I can't deliver.

30:10.286 --> 30:11.418
- Then don't promise,
but you're not even

30:11.461 --> 30:12.854
talking to them.

30:12.898 --> 30:13.942
- I'm trying to stop
a riot from breaking out.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.814
And I've got news for you.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.641
Most of my voters don't give
a shit about the homeless.

30:17.685 --> 30:18.773
- There it is.
You're always looking

30:18.817 --> 30:20.644
to straddle the fence.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.646
- And what about you?
- Me?

30:22.690 --> 30:23.822
- Yeah.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.301
Every day you come in here,

30:25.345 --> 30:26.650
you take a paycheck
with one hand

30:26.694 --> 30:28.478
and you hold your nose
with the other.

30:28.522 --> 30:29.784
- I'm trying to be loyal to you

30:29.828 --> 30:31.264
without falling off
a moral cliff.

30:31.307 --> 30:33.222
- Well, don't.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.834
Pick a fucking side.

30:37.792 --> 30:38.749
- I just did.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.757
- God damn it.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.982
- I wish I could tell you.

30:56.724 --> 30:59.858
My life would be
so much easier if I could.

31:01.903 --> 31:04.297
But I can't do that to you.

31:06.386 --> 31:09.737
- I guess I should thank
the FBI for...

31:09.780 --> 31:12.609
showing me what I should've
seen all along.

31:13.784 --> 31:16.309
- I wanted this to work.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.745
I know you don't believe me.

31:17.788 --> 31:20.530
- Oh, I believe you.

31:20.574 --> 31:24.230
The sad thing is
I really do believe you.

31:26.058 --> 31:28.234
But now it's too late.

31:33.848 --> 31:38.592
- I'll, uh--I'll destroy
that file you gave me.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.899
I owe you that much.

31:46.774 --> 31:49.255
- Look around, Jess.

31:50.430 --> 31:51.910
Look at where we are.

31:53.737 --> 31:56.305
Why are you doing this?

31:56.349 --> 31:59.265
Please, please don't give me
that bullshit about

31:59.308 --> 32:01.615
atoning for your father and
reaching out to your family.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.530
The truth, please.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.489
That's what you owe me.

32:10.015 --> 32:13.888
- I've only ever said
this to one other person.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.370
And it sounds a little crazy.

32:19.850 --> 32:22.897
But life...is this.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.597
I like this.

32:36.911 --> 32:38.782
- Yeah.

32:41.481 --> 32:43.874
Well, I'm good with
life the way it is.

32:53.145 --> 32:55.930
Take this.
Call my friend.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.627
- Jeff...

32:57.671 --> 33:01.109
Cooperate, Jessica.

33:01.153 --> 33:04.330
Wear a wire.
Do whatever they ask.

33:06.071 --> 33:09.030
It's the last thing
I'll ever ask of you.

33:21.434 --> 33:25.090
- I remember the first time
I saw you speak in this room.

33:28.658 --> 33:31.444
My dad said,
"Don't date some alderman.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.185
"You're used to the good life.

33:33.228 --> 33:36.188
Those guys never really
amount to anything."

33:36.231 --> 33:39.191
And then...

33:39.234 --> 33:42.455
I snuck in the back

33:42.498 --> 33:45.327
and you were going on
about the smoking ban,

33:45.371 --> 33:47.329
do you remember that?
- Mm-hmm.

33:47.373 --> 33:49.201
- I think at that point
you already had the votes

33:49.244 --> 33:53.161
but you were so passionate,
so principled.

33:53.205 --> 33:55.555
I mean, my God, Bobby,
you were 28 years old

33:55.598 --> 33:57.513
and you were
standing up to Daley.

33:57.557 --> 34:01.213
And I thought,
"My family is wrong.

34:01.256 --> 34:05.260
This guy,
this guy's going places."

34:05.304 --> 34:06.827
- Gold digger.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.357
And I thought things
would never change.

34:33.767 --> 34:36.335
- Should probably talk
about how to play this.

34:39.381 --> 34:41.818
- I don't want a divorce,
Bobby.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.780
I just want the man
that I saw that day.

34:46.823 --> 34:49.522
- Steph--
- I don't wanna throw away

34:49.565 --> 34:51.437
everything that
we have built together.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.570
Not if you are willing
to change.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.880
- I'm not sure
that guy exists anymore.

35:08.454 --> 35:11.457
Well, if he doesn't, then you
should sign those papers.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.406
- Please clear out
the public space.

35:49.451 --> 35:52.280
We need all these tents
removed from the plaza.

35:52.324 --> 35:55.631
This is a direct order from
the Chicago Police Department.

35:55.675 --> 35:58.199
I repeat, please clear
out the public space.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.679
- Not going anywhere!

35:59.722 --> 36:02.899
all:
Not going anywhere!

36:04.074 --> 36:07.687
- I repeat, please clear
out the public space.

36:07.730 --> 36:10.733
all:
Not going anywhere!

36:13.258 --> 36:14.868
- Please.

36:14.911 --> 36:16.348
Everyone....

36:18.959 --> 36:21.004
I know you don't trust me,

36:21.048 --> 36:23.659
but the best thing to do
is get on those buses.

36:23.703 --> 36:24.747
- Damn right we
don't trust you.

36:24.791 --> 36:28.534
all: Yeah!

36:28.577 --> 36:30.231
- Yeah, well, you shouldn't.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.754
You shouldn't trust me.

36:31.798 --> 36:34.453
I'm a fucking politician,
right?

36:34.496 --> 36:37.543
We say whatever
we want to get elected.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.327
And when we're elected
we say whatever we need to say

36:39.371 --> 36:40.807
to get re-elected.

36:43.026 --> 36:45.072
I wouldn't trust me either.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.901
But I want everyone in Chicago

36:47.944 --> 36:50.817
to hear me right now.

36:50.860 --> 36:54.299
I want
affordable public housing

36:54.342 --> 36:56.910
for every resident in need.

36:56.953 --> 36:58.390
If that makes me too liberal--

36:58.433 --> 37:00.740
hell, if that makes me
a socialist,

37:00.783 --> 37:02.829
I don't care.

37:02.872 --> 37:05.919
Every one of us could
be where you are right now.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.834
Every single one of us.

37:07.877 --> 37:10.576
It's not enough
to walk by and say,

37:10.619 --> 37:11.925
"There but for
the grace of God."

37:11.968 --> 37:13.318
We have to do something.

37:13.361 --> 37:14.797
So I am telling you,

37:14.841 --> 37:17.539
if I don't get
a 21st Century Housing Project

37:17.583 --> 37:19.759
for every homeless person
in Chicago

37:19.802 --> 37:21.935
through the City Council
before next year's election,

37:21.978 --> 37:24.416
vote me out.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.548
If I fail...

37:26.592 --> 37:28.028
I don't deserve
to be your mayor.

37:28.071 --> 37:29.986
- Damn right.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.684
- Vote me out.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.951
That's the best I can do.

37:37.994 --> 37:41.302
Now, please,
go get on those buses.

37:42.912 --> 37:44.305
Please.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.007
- You heard the man.

37:51.051 --> 37:52.748
He's gonna give us
what we want.

37:52.792 --> 37:55.882
Now let's hold him to it.
C'mon, guys, let's go.

37:55.925 --> 37:59.102
C'mon, let's pack up these
tents and get out of here.

38:12.638 --> 38:15.075
- Go be with your friends.

38:15.118 --> 38:17.469
- You sure?

38:17.512 --> 38:20.123
- Yeah, I'm sure.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.648
- Thank you.

39:19.095 --> 39:21.141
We need to meet,

39:21.184 --> 39:24.013
but it can't be here.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.059
It's about Nick.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.547
- All right,
let's bring her in.

39:35.590 --> 39:37.810
- Okay, let's head out.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.008
- Keri Allen?

40:02.051 --> 40:03.618
FBI.

40:03.662 --> 40:07.013
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

40:23.812 --> 40:26.249
- Ms. Pearson?

40:26.293 --> 40:28.208
- Everything okay, ma'am?

40:28.251 --> 40:29.688
- I'm fine, Oscar.

40:29.731 --> 40:31.820
Thank you.

40:45.530 --> 40:46.966
- Home, Ms. Pearson?

40:47.009 --> 40:48.881
- I'm gonna walk tonight.

41:07.682 --> 41:10.163
Calumet and 61st.

41:33.926 --> 41:36.015
- Hello?
- Is he with you?

41:36.058 --> 41:38.234
I need to know.
- Look, I'm kind of in the--

41:38.278 --> 41:41.107
- He's supposed to meet me
and he's not here.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.022
- He's not with me, I swear.

41:43.065 --> 41:45.024
- Have you spoken to him?

41:45.067 --> 41:47.069
- Jessica, what's going on?
Where are you?

41:47.113 --> 41:49.028
- Stay on the line.

41:49.071 --> 41:50.682
- You're scaring me.

41:50.725 --> 41:52.684
Where--where are you?
What's going on?

41:54.424 --> 41:55.861
Jessica.

41:55.904 --> 41:57.819
- Look out, lady!

41:57.863 --> 41:59.081
How much?

42:07.437 --> 42:08.917
- He's here.

42:23.236 --> 42:24.890
- Where's Nick?

42:24.933 --> 42:26.282
- Your brother's safe.

42:29.198 --> 42:31.723
- Is that why we're out here
at midnight?

42:31.766 --> 42:33.202
So you can blackmail me again?

42:33.246 --> 42:34.900
- We're here because
Nick wants to confess

42:34.943 --> 42:36.902
to killing Tommy Diehl,

42:36.945 --> 42:40.209
and the FBI has both of us
under surveillance.

42:40.253 --> 42:42.168
- Jesus Christ.

42:42.211 --> 42:45.301
- I take it that's a reaction
to the surveillance,

42:45.345 --> 42:46.912
since you knew about Diehl.

42:48.783 --> 42:50.611
- Where is he?

42:50.655 --> 42:52.178
- He's ready
to turn himself in, Mr. Mayor.

42:52.221 --> 42:54.789
- God damn it.
He--he can't do that.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.312
- Why not?

42:56.356 --> 42:58.314
Because you're the one
who killed him?

43:00.969 --> 43:04.277
Your brother is ready
to go to prison for you.

43:04.320 --> 43:05.757
- I heard you.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.149
- Well, then do
something about it.

43:07.193 --> 43:08.934
- What do you want me to say?
For all I know,

43:08.977 --> 43:10.326
you could be working
for the Feds right now.

43:10.370 --> 43:12.024
- You want your men
to come and pat me down,

43:12.067 --> 43:14.635
see if I'm wearing a wire?
We can go that way.

43:14.679 --> 43:18.944
But you brought me in
to fix your McGann problem

43:18.987 --> 43:23.296
and now that I know what it is,
I say we get to work.

43:23.339 --> 43:27.169
But let me be perfectly clear.

43:27.213 --> 43:30.303
I fix this mess for you,

43:30.346 --> 43:32.305
I'm done being
your errand girl.

43:58.331 --> 43:59.767
- Aaron! Aaron!

44:01.029 --> 44:02.335
- Oy.
