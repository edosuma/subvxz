00:00.250 --> 00:02.025
I know it's been difficult...

00:02.150 --> 00:03.575
..but I'm going to fix things...

00:04.225 --> 00:05.300
..for both of us.

00:06.275 --> 00:08.425
I should've talked to you.
I screwed up.

00:08.550 --> 00:12.175
If moving away is what you need,
I won't ask you to stay.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.100
I wouldn't do that to you.

00:14.375 --> 00:17.100
Father Richard McEwan
was found this morning.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.600
The same person
killed Ifan Williams.

00:20.250 --> 00:25.025
Where are we going, Sion?
On an adventure.

00:25.300 --> 00:28.350
Glyn Thomas and his brother,
Sion Thomas.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.250
Their last known address is local.

00:30.525 --> 00:34.225
It might be out of date
but that's where we start.

01:10.275 --> 01:12.275
DOGS BARK

02:23.475 --> 02:24.475
Ma'am?

02:24.600 --> 02:27.125
Sorry to disturb you.
It's fine.

02:27.250 --> 02:30.475
DS Vaughan wanted you to know that
he's on his way to the farm.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.050
Send a patrol car to be stationed
there until we find Sion and Glyn.

02:34.325 --> 02:37.100
Have the neighbours
given us anything?

02:37.225 --> 02:39.075
PC Davies is with them now.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.425
Road blocks have been set up on all
A-roads within a 30 mile radius.

02:43.075 --> 02:47.200
A description of the car and
its PNC number have been circulated.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.075
Ma'am?

03:26.475 --> 03:27.475
Alys.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.250
OK.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.375
I'll need to speak to her. Now.

03:34.325 --> 03:36.075
Text me the address.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.000
Where are we?

04:07.100 --> 04:08.350
Sion?

04:10.150 --> 04:11.150
Ty'd.

04:14.325 --> 04:16.350
Sion?
I said come on!

04:58.425 --> 05:00.425
SIREN

05:10.550 --> 05:13.275
And they'll stay
until they catch him?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.575
Of course.

05:15.075 --> 05:16.550
You're perfectly safe...

05:17.050 --> 05:21.025
..though it would be best
to bring your mother-in-law here.

05:21.150 --> 05:24.250
I promise. You're safe.

05:27.050 --> 05:29.050
CAR DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE

05:29.225 --> 05:30.400
I can't believe it.

05:32.175 --> 05:34.025
I don't understand why.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.100
Siwan, come and sit down please.

05:49.250 --> 05:53.275
I'm afraid we've uncovered
some information about Ifan's past.

05:55.575 --> 05:59.225
Sion's mother, Branwen,
was killed in a house fire.

06:02.050 --> 06:04.475
The fire was started deliberately...

06:04.600 --> 06:08.100
..but because of a lack of
physical evidence...

06:08.275 --> 06:12.400
..and an absence of any real motive,
no-one was ever charged.

06:14.175 --> 06:17.350
I'm afraid to say...
Stop... please.

06:22.375 --> 06:25.350
..it seems that Ifan
was behind the attack.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
I'm sorry.

06:36.075 --> 06:38.075
SHE SOBS

DOGS BARK

06:53.225 --> 06:54.450
So this was revenge?

06:54.575 --> 06:58.425
It's too early to say for sure
but it seems that way.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.375
He always had
what I thought was confidence.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.525
That's what I liked about him.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.500
But, in time,
I saw it wasn't confidence.

07:16.050 --> 07:18.050
It was a sense of entitlement.

07:18.175 --> 07:19.375
Arrogance.

07:20.375 --> 07:24.075
I don't think anyone ever said 'no'
to him in his life.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.225
I can't believe he was so cruel.

07:32.025 --> 07:33.325
That poor family.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.200
Hey.

07:43.225 --> 07:45.375
How come you're down here?

07:46.075 --> 07:47.325
Can't sleep?

07:48.450 --> 07:50.200
Come on. Back to bed.

08:34.125 --> 08:35.125
Miss Lewis?

08:36.075 --> 08:37.125
Yes. Come in.

08:43.400 --> 08:47.500
Alys said you'd noticed a change
in Sion's behaviour...

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
..over the past few weeks?

08:52.100 --> 08:55.000
Can you explain
what you meant by that?

08:55.125 --> 08:58.075
I went to see him this afternoon...

08:58.200 --> 09:01.175
..and there was something more...

09:03.075 --> 09:04.525
Something different.

09:07.150 --> 09:08.575
Why did you go and see him?

09:12.275 --> 09:13.275
Hannah?

09:15.100 --> 09:17.450
What is it?
What aren't you telling me?

09:17.575 --> 09:19.475
He phoned me last night.

09:21.350 --> 09:23.125
OK. What did he want?

09:23.250 --> 09:26.325
I didn't pick up.
It was the middle of the night.

09:26.450 --> 09:27.450
What time?

09:29.225 --> 09:30.300
2.00am.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.375
Then, this morning...

09:34.500 --> 09:38.175
..I heard what had happened
on the estate.

09:40.575 --> 09:43.400
He's been really agitated lately.

09:49.125 --> 09:51.050
Do you think that he...?

09:52.275 --> 09:53.275
We don't know.

09:55.575 --> 09:59.300
What we've got to do now
is find him, OK?

09:59.425 --> 10:01.050
This is important.

10:01.525 --> 10:04.050
Can you think of anywhere he'd go?

10:04.175 --> 10:06.275
I'm sorry... I can't believe it.

10:07.550 --> 10:09.500
Glyn is definitely with him?

10:12.500 --> 10:14.075
Oh my God!

10:16.225 --> 10:17.425
What have I done?

10:18.200 --> 10:19.525
This is not your fault.

10:22.425 --> 10:25.200
I should've gone back there
last night.

10:26.325 --> 10:30.350
I shouldn't have listened to him.
Who?

10:32.125 --> 10:33.125
Sion.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.325
He told me
never to go back there again.

10:38.325 --> 10:41.025
To never think about them again.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.075
So I left.

10:43.550 --> 10:46.050
And I saw Glyn...!

10:47.300 --> 10:51.275
I should have taken him with me
and I don't know why I didn't.

10:52.225 --> 10:55.250
Do you think Sion
could ever hurt Glyn?

10:57.275 --> 10:58.350
Sion loves Glyn.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.175
He loves his brother.

11:04.325 --> 11:06.250
That's not what I'm asking.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.425
Sion?

11:22.550 --> 11:24.175
Where are we?

11:26.100 --> 11:27.425
What are we doing here?

11:31.475 --> 11:32.475
Come on.

12:10.475 --> 12:13.375
No sightings as of yet.
They can't have vanished.

12:15.175 --> 12:18.025
I don't like this.
We've got to find them.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.125
(OVER RADIO) This is Victor 276.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.450
There's been no sightings of
the suspect on the A461 as of 23.45.

12:24.575 --> 12:26.500
We continue to patrol the area.
Over.

12:27.150 --> 12:28.300
Thanks. Over.

FORMER NURSE DIES IN HOUSE FIRE

14:27.150 --> 14:28.400
Where was he working?

14:29.050 --> 14:31.150
Sion - where was he working last?

14:31.275 --> 14:34.425
At the old hospital.
We interviewed him there.

14:35.350 --> 14:37.025
That's where they are.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.250
All patrol vehicles...

14:40.375 --> 14:44.200
..report to co-ordinates 11 44 62.

15:35.175 --> 15:37.500
(VAUGHAN) There! It's their car.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.225
Organise the checkpoint.
I'll go on ahead.

16:05.025 --> 16:06.050
Be careful.

16:07.225 --> 16:09.225
SIREN

16:10.125 --> 16:11.275
DS Vaughan to HQ.

16:11.550 --> 16:15.050
All officers at Awel Fan,
report to me at the main entrance.

16:42.350 --> 16:44.225
I used to wait here...

16:45.300 --> 16:47.025
..for you, for Mam...

16:47.475 --> 16:49.575
..after your appointments.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.275
Do you remember?
No.

16:54.350 --> 16:57.200
I'm getting wet, Sion.
I wanna go home.

17:08.275 --> 17:10.075
I used to wait here.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.225
It was safe.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.175
Hidden away.

17:20.050 --> 17:21.325
No-one could see you.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.100
It was like a den.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.475
We were... we were so happy.
You must remember!

17:29.600 --> 17:31.150
I don't know.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.425
Maybe I do...

17:33.025 --> 17:35.275
Don't do that! Don't lie to me.

17:36.300 --> 17:40.375
I don't know what you want, Sion!
I want...! I want it back.

17:41.350 --> 17:45.550
That's what I want, I want it back!
I want that feeling of being safe.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.475
We are safe.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.275
We are happy.

17:51.125 --> 17:53.075
What are you talking about?

17:55.600 --> 17:57.275
Nothing changed.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.250
Of course things changed!

18:00.325 --> 18:02.225
Everything changed!

18:06.350 --> 18:07.600
Not for me.

18:19.375 --> 18:21.300
Heading into the building.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.575
I want every entrance
to this place covered.

18:26.425 --> 18:29.450
Stand back until I give you
the command and no lights.

18:30.450 --> 18:32.175
Repeat, no lights.

19:04.025 --> 19:05.150
Glyn, come on!

19:08.450 --> 19:11.475
You said you'd come with me.
You said we'd go home.

19:13.050 --> 19:16.325
We will... just after this,
I promise.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.100
You trust me, don't you?

19:24.350 --> 19:25.500
Ty'd laen.

19:57.175 --> 19:59.275
Vaughan, they're up on the roof.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.300
I need backup... now!

20:08.225 --> 20:11.075
Hey, it's alright.
Just don't look down.

20:11.350 --> 20:13.450
I don't like it up here, Sion.
I wanna go back.

20:14.100 --> 20:15.250
We're alright.

20:16.025 --> 20:19.075
We're always gonna be alright.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.225
What are you doing, Sion?

20:24.600 --> 20:25.600
Let's go back.

20:27.375 --> 20:28.425
Please.

20:30.025 --> 20:31.375
Let's go together.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.075
Ti a fi.
Sion, stop!

20:37.050 --> 20:38.100
I'm scared.

20:40.175 --> 20:42.400
We were happy, weren't we?

20:43.425 --> 20:49.025
Sometimes, you've just got to
do things so that everything's fair.

20:49.425 --> 20:50.550
Sion, no.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.400
So that everyone's looked after.
No!

20:55.100 --> 20:56.300
I don't want to.

20:57.575 --> 20:58.575
Come on!

20:59.525 --> 21:00.525
No!

21:01.175 --> 21:02.450
Come... come and see!

21:03.075 --> 21:04.375
No...!

21:05.525 --> 21:08.175
No! Listen to me!

21:08.475 --> 21:10.125
I said no!

21:11.025 --> 21:12.475
I told you I wanted to go home.

21:13.175 --> 21:14.450
I don't wanna do this.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.050
Sion! What are you doing?

21:30.175 --> 21:31.225
Come back.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.175
Don't, Sion!

21:39.075 --> 21:40.300
Don't, Sion!

21:43.050 --> 21:44.175
Sion!

21:46.275 --> 21:47.450
Glyn?

21:52.225 --> 21:53.250
Sion?

21:53.375 --> 21:55.250
I have to go home now.

21:56.175 --> 21:57.600
Glyn, take my hand.

21:59.150 --> 22:01.525
Glyn, come with me.
You're safe now, it's OK.

22:02.025 --> 22:03.050
I'm sorry, Sion.

22:04.250 --> 22:05.500
Glyn, come to me.

22:09.100 --> 22:10.100
Good.

22:10.525 --> 22:11.525
Good.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.550
Sion?

22:26.575 --> 22:27.600
My name is Cadi.

22:29.350 --> 22:30.600
I'm here to listen.

22:43.450 --> 22:45.000
Your brother's OK.

22:46.250 --> 22:47.325
You're OK.

22:52.525 --> 22:54.075
I'm tired...

22:55.150 --> 22:56.375
I'm so tired!

22:57.150 --> 22:58.150
Sion...

22:58.600 --> 23:01.125
..I can see you've suffered.

23:01.250 --> 23:02.400
I can feel it.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.175
Tell him I'm sorry.

23:07.550 --> 23:09.000
No!

23:17.350 --> 23:19.350
ANGUISHED CRIES

23:21.525 --> 23:23.525
HE SOBS

24:47.375 --> 24:49.150
I'm going to miss this.

24:52.125 --> 24:55.325
It's hard to find someone
you can be quiet with.

24:57.450 --> 24:58.450
How's Glyn?

24:59.325 --> 25:02.150
We've kept him
in the soft interview room.

25:03.025 --> 25:06.450
We'll just run him through
the events as they happened.

25:06.575 --> 25:08.025
See what he says.

25:09.150 --> 25:11.000
PHONE RINGS

25:13.100 --> 25:14.375
You going to get that?

25:17.475 --> 25:19.425

25:39.025 --> 25:41.075

26:02.025 --> 26:04.075
Present are DCI Cadi John and...

26:04.200 --> 26:06.475
..please state your names
for the tape.

26:06.600 --> 26:10.225
William Hewitt.
(CRACKED VOICE) Sion Thomas.

26:13.475 --> 26:17.500
Sion Thomas, you've been arrested
for the murders of Ifan Williams...

26:18.000 --> 26:19.450
..and Father Richard McEwan.

26:20.175 --> 26:21.550
Do you understand that?

26:24.400 --> 26:25.400
Yes.

26:29.375 --> 26:32.225
Ifan Williams was killed
on his way home...

26:32.500 --> 26:34.125
Where's Glyn?

26:36.350 --> 26:38.050
He's being questioned.

26:38.325 --> 26:39.525
Is there someone with him?

26:40.175 --> 26:43.150
He has to have
an appropriate adult with him.

26:43.275 --> 26:45.075
Yes. We're aware of that.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.325
All procedures are being followed.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.475
He'll be treated well.
Of course he will...!

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
Sion...

26:56.125 --> 26:59.100
..I don't need any more evidence.

27:01.525 --> 27:05.275
I have matching DNA profiles
at both murder scenes...

27:05.400 --> 27:09.325
..and I suspect that, when the
sample you gave us comes back...

27:12.200 --> 27:15.250
In theory, we could all go home.

27:18.075 --> 27:20.350
On paper, everything's sewn up.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.250
The thing is...

27:25.375 --> 27:28.475
..life tends to be
more complicated than that.

27:35.125 --> 27:37.125
I want you to look at these.

27:40.550 --> 27:42.425
I want you to tell me why.

27:45.075 --> 27:48.125
Why a hard-working young man...

27:48.250 --> 27:49.550
..a carer...

27:50.050 --> 27:52.000
..decided to murder two men?

27:52.125 --> 27:55.000
Two men you'd known for years.

27:59.025 --> 28:03.425
How could you
squeeze the life out of them...

28:03.550 --> 28:07.550
..until you crushed the bones
in their necks?

28:16.550 --> 28:18.575
Help me to help you.

28:26.375 --> 28:27.450
No.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.350
The thing is...

28:36.150 --> 28:37.525
..I have a duty.

28:39.525 --> 28:42.075
A duty to these men's families.

28:43.450 --> 28:46.075
To Ifan's wife... his child.

28:50.125 --> 28:53.250
He had a son... a little boy.

28:53.375 --> 28:55.550
Five or six years old?

28:59.050 --> 29:03.200
I have to somehow
make sense of this for them.

29:06.225 --> 29:09.350
It must have been difficult for you,
growing up.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.250
Your father left...

29:13.375 --> 29:18.425
..then you lost your mother and,
overnight, you became Glyn's carer.

29:18.550 --> 29:22.200
Glyn isn't a problem... a burden.

29:23.075 --> 29:24.525
He's my brother.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.325
I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to be
disrespectful.

29:29.475 --> 29:31.025
Weren't you?

29:33.250 --> 29:35.075
You sit there...

29:36.250 --> 29:37.600
..analysing.

29:38.575 --> 29:40.200
Looking in.

29:42.375 --> 29:44.225
You think you understand.

29:47.400 --> 29:50.025
My mother died young too.

29:52.450 --> 29:53.600
Car accident.

29:56.300 --> 29:58.050
I was with her.

29:59.150 --> 30:00.525
I watched her die.

30:02.125 --> 30:04.275
I could do nothing about it.

30:05.025 --> 30:07.575
There was something about
that feeling.

30:09.225 --> 30:12.375
That helplessness.

30:16.100 --> 30:17.425
It leaves a mark.

30:19.425 --> 30:22.400
You never want to
feel like that again.

30:23.525 --> 30:28.175
You want to control things
so you are the one making decisions.

30:28.300 --> 30:32.075
You are the one who has the power...

30:32.200 --> 30:35.050
..the ability to change things.

30:35.175 --> 30:36.425
To do things.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.400
I think that's what
you're doing now.

30:43.425 --> 30:46.025
Trying to control things.

30:50.150 --> 30:52.275
You think so?
Mm.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.500
I did it.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.100
I'm sorry?

31:04.525 --> 31:06.200
I did it.

31:09.175 --> 31:10.350
I killed them both.

31:10.475 --> 31:11.475
Mr Thomas...!

31:11.600 --> 31:13.575
I don't need your help.

31:15.225 --> 31:17.250
We both know how this goes.

31:20.375 --> 31:22.000
Charge me.

31:23.475 --> 31:25.100
Jail me.

31:29.125 --> 31:30.300
Sion...

31:32.175 --> 31:35.600
..what I'm doing here
is giving you the opportunity...

31:36.100 --> 31:39.025
..to set the record straight.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.100
What does it matter?

31:44.025 --> 31:45.450
The truth matters.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.450
I told you...

31:51.300 --> 31:52.475
..I did it.

31:54.325 --> 31:56.075
That's the truth.

32:00.350 --> 32:03.300
(VAUGHAN) I have to record
the conversation, if that's OK?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.500
I know this must be difficult.

32:08.075 --> 32:09.200
Confusing.

32:11.200 --> 32:15.150
I need you to walk me through
what's been happening at home.

32:18.375 --> 32:22.125
Can you tell me what things
have been like with Sion...

32:22.250 --> 32:24.100
..over the last few weeks?

32:24.225 --> 32:27.300
About a week ago,
Sion came home late one night.

32:27.425 --> 32:30.325
He was washing his hands. I saw him.

32:30.450 --> 32:33.125
There was blood on his clothes.

32:35.025 --> 32:38.100
I thought maybe he'd cut himself
or something.

32:39.475 --> 32:42.500
Has he done something really bad?

32:44.175 --> 32:45.550
I'm afraid so.

32:46.550 --> 32:50.425
What will happen to Sion?
Sion is being interviewed.

32:51.100 --> 32:53.250
Eventually, he'll go to court...

32:53.375 --> 32:56.600
..and, if he's found guilty
of one or both murders...

32:57.250 --> 33:00.325
..he'll be sent to prison
for a long time.

33:04.225 --> 33:06.125
How does that make you feel?

33:09.000 --> 33:10.250
Sad.

33:10.375 --> 33:13.050
I know he did the wrong thing...

33:13.175 --> 33:14.475
..but he's family.

33:22.150 --> 33:23.150
I'm so sorry.

33:23.450 --> 33:25.300
Will I be able to see him?

33:27.275 --> 33:28.475
I don't think so.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.525
Listen, I'll...

33:33.275 --> 33:36.250
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.425
Do you have a family?

33:42.075 --> 33:43.600
Yes, a partner.

33:44.100 --> 33:46.100
We have a little girl.

33:48.000 --> 33:53.275
I'd like to have children.
I think you'd make a great dad.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.225
Me too.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.125
How's it going?

34:14.550 --> 34:16.250
Full admission.

34:19.050 --> 34:22.350
Isn't that good?
For who?

34:22.475 --> 34:24.575
It's like he's given up.

34:25.075 --> 34:28.050
There's no fight in him anymore.

34:28.175 --> 34:31.250
He doesn't trust me.
Doesn't trust any of this.

34:32.500 --> 34:36.250
If he won't talk,
how can I help him?

34:38.350 --> 34:39.475
You'll get there.

34:39.600 --> 34:45.175
It only takes a few words sometimes
and everything changes.

35:48.075 --> 35:49.475
TURNS ON TAPE RECORDER

35:49.600 --> 35:51.225
What did he say to you?

35:53.175 --> 35:57.225
You were drinking at the bar
and you both left at the same time.

35:59.125 --> 36:01.050
Tell me, Sion, please...

36:01.575 --> 36:04.075
You go to the toilet
and he follows you.

36:04.350 --> 36:07.350
He comes back
but your drink is left on the bar.

36:07.475 --> 36:09.350
He said something...

36:10.000 --> 36:13.450
..and you left because
you couldn't process what you heard.

36:13.575 --> 36:16.375
What was it? A few little words.

36:19.225 --> 36:20.375
He leant in...

36:21.025 --> 36:22.400
..and he said...?

36:25.475 --> 36:27.100
He said...?

36:30.150 --> 36:31.400
He said...?

36:38.375 --> 36:40.125
I lit the match.

36:45.325 --> 36:49.200
He said, "I lit the match."

36:52.125 --> 36:53.375
He laughed.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.275
He killed her for a laugh.

37:01.275 --> 37:02.400
For a joke.

37:04.350 --> 37:08.200
And this place, this world,
let him do it!

37:10.450 --> 37:13.075
What did you do?

37:13.200 --> 37:15.450
Everything changed in that moment.

37:16.250 --> 37:18.325
I left. I waited.

37:20.550 --> 37:23.125
I followed him.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.200
I asked him.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.125
He just laughed.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.250
He laughed.

37:39.050 --> 37:40.600
I picked up that rock.

37:44.275 --> 37:46.175
I wasn't going to.

37:46.300 --> 37:48.275
I just wanted him to see...

37:51.575 --> 37:53.275
And Father McEwan?

37:59.575 --> 38:02.075
He came over a few days later...

38:03.150 --> 38:05.575
..and I knew he knew something.

38:07.275 --> 38:09.250
My mother trusted him.

38:10.425 --> 38:12.525
She asked him to look after us...

38:13.275 --> 38:14.275
..but he knew.

38:15.525 --> 38:19.025
He knew that fire
wasn't an accident.

38:20.425 --> 38:22.375
So you confronted him?

38:25.125 --> 38:27.125
I wanted to know if it was true.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.375
He wouldn't admit
he'd done anything wrong.

38:32.025 --> 38:34.050
He had his vows... his duties.

38:34.325 --> 38:35.575
To who?

38:41.050 --> 38:42.300
He was a liar.

38:42.425 --> 38:45.400
He betrayed us.
He betrayed my mother.

38:50.200 --> 38:52.600
And do you know
what the worst thing is?

38:57.300 --> 38:59.025
I betrayed her too.

39:00.175 --> 39:02.450
She taught us to keep quiet.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.400
She taught us
to turn the other cheek...

39:07.525 --> 39:09.150
..but I couldn't.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.450
I just couldn't do it anymore.

39:16.250 --> 39:19.000
Because you're human.

39:21.475 --> 39:25.175
What happened to your mother
was unforgivable.

39:28.150 --> 39:33.400
What happened to Ifan and to
Father McEwan was also unforgivable.

39:38.075 --> 39:40.325
That's the problem with hate.

39:41.475 --> 39:43.500
It grows. It spreads.

39:46.425 --> 39:49.400
No-one would have expected you
to understand...

39:49.525 --> 39:51.525
..what happened to your mother...

39:52.025 --> 39:53.550
..but we would have helped.

39:57.350 --> 40:02.125
Your mother wouldn't have judged you
as harshly as you judge yourself.

40:05.175 --> 40:07.025
She loved us so much.

40:09.325 --> 40:12.400
The way she was
is such a rare thing.

40:21.100 --> 40:22.125
I'm so sorry...

40:23.100 --> 40:25.100
HE SOBS

40:27.450 --> 40:29.200
So am I.

41:01.575 --> 41:03.575
DOOR SLAMS SHUT

41:57.050 --> 41:59.000
I don't feel anything.

42:00.425 --> 42:03.300
I thought there'd be... something.

42:04.050 --> 42:05.425
Relief... anger.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.350
I just feel empty.

42:14.525 --> 42:16.175
It's the shock.

42:17.475 --> 42:21.400
It took me years, after Dai,
to even cry properly.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.025
It'll come.

42:28.300 --> 42:30.175
The feelings will come.

42:31.550 --> 42:34.050
The trick is to let them in...

42:35.125 --> 42:37.025
..because, by then...

42:37.300 --> 42:39.350
..you'll be coping.

42:40.150 --> 42:42.100
(GUTO) Mam! Come here!

42:43.025 --> 42:45.250
And you won't be alone.

44:15.400 --> 44:17.400
SION SOBS

44:20.000 --> 44:21.550
It's going to be alright.

44:27.025 --> 44:28.500
Things will be alright.

44:56.175 --> 44:57.350
I'm going home.

45:01.050 --> 45:04.125
Well, I guess
I won't see you tomorrow.

45:15.575 --> 45:17.525
That's quite enough of that.

45:21.125 --> 45:23.075
I never liked you anyway...!

45:23.200 --> 45:25.200
THEY CHUCKLE

45:56.000 --> 45:57.525
I'll be alright you know.

45:58.175 --> 45:59.300
I know.

46:00.200 --> 46:01.575
I'm home now.
