Hey, Jack,

There's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

00:06.448 --> 00:07.548

00:07.616 --> 00:09.849
I want your permission

Jack:
I just rolled in myself.

04:19.418 --> 04:20.652
I went to look
at a used tractor

04:20.720 --> 04:22.154
near Okotoks.

04:22.222 --> 04:25.424
A wasted trip -
thing was a piece of junk.

04:25.492 --> 04:28.226
Ty: Hey, you think I
could borrow some tools?

04:28.293 --> 04:29.494
Help yourself.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.794
The heater in the trailer broke

04:30.862 --> 04:32.263
and the damn water pipes burst, so...

04:32.331 --> 04:33.931
(Chuckles)

04:33.999 --> 04:37.168
Can I, uh, stay up in the loft

He jumped straight over
the paddock fence,

06:29.458 --> 06:31.826
So the house,
it's comin' along, right?

06:31.894 --> 06:32.960
Quite the project.

06:33.028 --> 06:34.895
Challenging,
but I like challenging.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.864
(Exasperated) You do?
Well...

06:36.931 --> 06:39.433
Well, that's-that's good,
because Domenic...

Hey, man, I told you,
call me Dom.

06:41.503 --> 06:43.404
Lou:
Oh, okay. Hi, Dom.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.672
Um, listen, we're just a little
concerned with the speed

06:45.740 --> 06:47.307
at which
things are getting done.

06:47.375 --> 06:49.009
Peter:
Or not getting done, really.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.843
Dom:
What're you saying?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.177
Lou: Well, we were supposed to
move in three months ago, so...

06:52.546 --> 06:54.514
Do you only have two guys
working for you here?

06:54.581 --> 06:55.948
Maybe you should hire
a couple more guys.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.249
Maybe that's what's taking
so long here, Dom.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.251
No, my friend,
it's taking that long

06:59.319 --> 07:00.820
because every time
we go to fix something

07:00.888 --> 07:03.389
we find something else
that needs to be fixed.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.857
The place is old.

07:04.925 --> 07:07.158
The wiring isn't code,
the plumbing's falling apart,

07:07.226 --> 07:09.227
the ceilings
are collapsing.

07:09.295 --> 07:11.563
Totally unavoidable,
totally unexpected.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.698
Peter: Well, no, you have to
expect these kind of things.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.534
It's not new construction, Dom,
all right?

07:15.601 --> 07:16.835
It's renovation.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.538
And that's why they call it
renovation hell.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.640
Right, Pete?
Am I right?

07:21.707 --> 07:23.273
But, hey,
things are lookin' up.

07:23.341 --> 07:25.843
The last of the old plaster's
coming out today.

07:25.911 --> 07:27.745
You'll have your dream house

07:27.813 --> 07:29.046

Good. Come on.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.561

Hello?

07:44.628 --> 07:46.896
Is Ty here?
Where's he at?

07:46.964 --> 07:48.931
The loft.

07:48.999 --> 07:51.767
Hey, hey,
stop right there!

07:53.636 --> 07:55.471
What are you gonna do
with that horse?

07:55.538 --> 07:56.839
(Sighs)

07:56.906 --> 07:58.274
Look, I have no idea
why he jumps fences.

07:58.342 --> 07:59.708
He just does.

07:59.776 --> 08:01.710
He shows up here
out of the blue.

08:01.778 --> 08:03.544
It's the third time
in as many days

08:03.612 --> 08:04.912
you've had to chase
after him.

08:04.981 --> 08:06.047
I know.

08:06.115 --> 08:07.515
I've posted notices
on the Internet

08:07.583 --> 08:08.816
and all over town,

08:08.884 --> 08:10.385
and I'm waiting for someone
to claim Phoenix.

08:10.453 --> 08:13.021
Phoenix?
Oh, you've given him a name?

08:13.089 --> 08:15.323
Phoenix suits him.

08:15.391 --> 08:17.658
Full name:
Phoenix Rising.

08:18.594 --> 08:23.297
Jack: Well, do something to
fix him and his crazy habit.

08:29.137 --> 08:30.070
- Hey!
- Hey!

08:30.138 --> 08:31.771
What're you doin'
here?

08:31.839 --> 08:34.674
Agh! Broken heater,
so the pipes are frozen.

08:34.741 --> 08:36.308
Oh. I was kinda hoping

08:36.376 --> 08:37.743
you were just missing me
so much

08:37.811 --> 08:39.212
that you had to move
back in.

08:39.279 --> 08:41.714
(Chuckles)
Well, I just might.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.216
That trailer
is falling apart.

08:43.283 --> 08:45.084
It's like living
in a soup can,

08:45.152 --> 08:46.486
and Caleb is still
charging me rent

08:46.553 --> 08:49.288
even though he's not around
to fix anything, so...

08:49.356 --> 08:51.089
You a little grouchy?
Should I just go?

08:51.157 --> 08:52.090
Maybe I'll just-

08:52.158 --> 08:54.126
Ty:
Hey, you...

08:54.193 --> 08:55.227
Amy:
(Chuckles)

08:56.362 --> 08:57.695
I wanna ask you
something.

08:57.763 --> 08:58.930
Mm-hmm?

08:58.998 --> 09:01.933
I want to ask you out
on a date.

09:02.935 --> 09:04.102
- A date?
- Yeah.

09:04.170 --> 09:05.837
- Just you and me?
- Yeah.

09:05.905 --> 09:07.938
We haven't had one of those
in, like, months.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.873
Well, then it's about time
we went on one.

09:09.941 --> 09:11.442
How about tonight?

09:11.510 --> 09:12.609
We could go for dinner
some place

09:12.677 --> 09:15.612
and then go for a drive
or something?

09:15.680 --> 09:18.149
Yeah, yeah. Why tonight? Yeah?

09:18.216 --> 09:19.350
I guess it's, uh,

09:19.418 --> 09:21.018
kind of a special time
of year.

09:21.086 --> 09:23.753
What makes it special?

09:23.820 --> 09:25.955
I don't know.
I'll tell you tonight.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.958
Amy: Okay, all right,
I like that idea.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.228
(Construction workers chatter,
hammering in the distance)

09:38.835 --> 09:41.636
That'll barely cover the cost
of the drywall, Pete.

09:41.704 --> 09:44.973
Peter: Well, Dom, put up some
drywall and we'll reconvene, okay?

09:45.041 --> 09:46.575
(Truck door slams shut)

09:46.642 --> 09:47.576

10:00.922 --> 10:02.490
<i>(Drill whirs loudly)</i>

10:02.558 --> 10:04.325
That's the sound of your bank

10:05.427 --> 10:06.760

10:08.464 --> 10:11.264
<i>Listen, general, I got an idea</i>
<i>I wanna run by you.</i>

10:11.332 --> 10:13.666
How would you like to make
your first million?

10:13.734 --> 10:15.802
Or remake your first million?

10:16.837 --> 10:18.338
Peter:
No thanks, Tim.

10:18.406 --> 10:19.706
No? You haven't even heard
the idea yet.

10:19.773 --> 10:22.375

10:33.953 --> 10:36.288
Amy: Hey!
So how's the dream house coming?

10:39.192 --> 10:40.993
Oh, that good, huh?

10:41.060 --> 10:43.394
At this point,
it is more of a nightmare.

10:43.462 --> 10:44.596

<i>Hmm.</i>

10:44.663 --> 10:46.063

What are you so chipper about?

10:47.466 --> 10:48.600
Oh, nothing.

10:48.667 --> 10:51.002
Just that Ty and I are
going on a date -

10:51.069 --> 10:53.104
like a real date -
tonight.

10:53.172 --> 10:55.540
A date? Why?

10:55.608 --> 10:58.176
I mean, why-
why so formal?

10:58.244 --> 10:59.544
I don't know.

10:59.612 --> 11:05.215
He said something about it
being a special time.

11:05.283 --> 11:07.384
A special time.

11:07.452 --> 11:10.688
That's...
That's exciting, huh?

11:14.225 --> 11:15.526
It's nice.

11:15.593 --> 11:17.226
It's just a date,
Lou.

11:17.294 --> 11:18.628
Yeah, I know, Amy,
obviously.

11:18.696 --> 11:19.996
What else would it be?

11:22.332 --> 11:24.433
Tim:
(Grunts with effort)

11:26.403 --> 11:28.538
I got one word for you,
Jack:

11:28.605 --> 11:29.939
Franchise.

11:30.007 --> 11:33.142

What're you talkin' about now?

11:33.209 --> 11:34.777
Buying into a chain
of an already proven

11:34.844 --> 11:35.778
and successful business.

11:35.845 --> 11:38.246
I've been researching it.

11:38.314 --> 11:40.082
It's all about location,
location, location.

11:40.150 --> 11:41.817
Now, you know that vacant lot,

11:41.885 --> 11:43.152
the one across from
the big box store

11:43.219 --> 11:44.787
on your way into town?

11:44.854 --> 11:47.889
That is a perfect spot
for a Buff Burger franchise.

11:47.956 --> 11:49.323
Buff Burger?

11:49.391 --> 11:50.725
Tim: Yeah.
I went to one the other night

11:50.793 --> 11:52.193
with Miranda and Shane
up in Moosejaw

11:52.260 --> 11:53.761
and it was terrific,

11:53.829 --> 11:55.063
and busy, and cheap!

11:55.130 --> 11:57.065
It's a great franchise.

11:57.132 --> 11:59.901
And Buff Burger pays for
the building and the land.

11:59.968 --> 12:02.136
I don't know much about
the franchise business,

12:02.204 --> 12:04.004
but isn't there
a huge start-up,

12:04.072 --> 12:05.772
buy-in cost or something?

12:05.840 --> 12:07.808
Tim: Yeah, I mean it costs a
little somethin' at first,

12:07.875 --> 12:09.810
but people make millions.

12:09.877 --> 12:11.978
No, we buy a Buff Burger
franchise,

12:12.046 --> 12:13.446
start rakin' it in.

12:13.514 --> 12:16.983
We?! (Laughs)
I don't think so!

12:17.051 --> 12:18.185
You gotta think big,
Jack.

12:18.252 --> 12:20.419
No, I don't,
and if I were you

12:20.486 --> 12:21.854
I'd stick
to the cattle business,

12:21.922 --> 12:23.989
let somebody else
make the burgers.

12:29.262 --> 12:31.030
Amy:
All right.

12:31.098 --> 12:33.899
Since you love jumping
so much,

12:33.967 --> 12:36.267
why don't we practice on these,
huh?

12:36.335 --> 12:38.369
Maybe that'll get
some of your crazy energy out

12:38.437 --> 12:41.539
and you won't have to jump
over fences any more.

12:41.607 --> 12:42.974
All right? Okay.

12:44.309 --> 12:46.377
(Buckle clicks)
Good boy.

12:47.813 --> 12:49.013
(Clucks tongue)

12:52.250 --> 12:53.817
(Phoenix grunts
and takes off)

12:56.387 --> 12:58.889
All right, boy,
you can do it!

13:01.860 --> 13:03.460
Jump straight over the fences!

13:03.527 --> 13:04.862
Go! Go!

13:04.929 --> 13:06.529
(Laughs)
Good boy!

13:06.597 --> 13:07.631
Good boy!

13:09.166 --> 13:11.367
All right, come on!
You can do it again!

13:14.905 --> 13:16.839
You can do it!
Come on, come on!

13:16.907 --> 13:17.940
Good boy!

13:19.743 --> 13:22.678
Good boy!
(Laughs excitedly)

13:22.746 --> 13:24.112
(Gasps)

13:24.180 --> 13:25.947
Okay, that was awesome.

13:26.015 --> 13:26.982
Come on!

13:27.049 --> 13:30.118
Tim:
(Mumbles to Jack)

13:30.186 --> 13:32.320
Lou: Dad, I assume you're
staying for dinner?

13:32.388 --> 13:33.288
Tim:
Not a bad idea.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.389
It never is.

13:34.456 --> 13:35.690
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>That's weird.</i>

13:35.758 --> 13:37.525
Where's the lasagna
I made this morning?

13:37.593 --> 13:38.593
<i>Tim:</i> <i>Jack, just take a
look</i> <i>at these figures.</i>

13:38.661 --> 13:39.860
<i>Foolproof!</i>

13:39.928 --> 13:41.028
No, I'm sure I put it
in the fridge.

13:41.096 --> 13:42.263
Grampa,
did you eat my lasagna?

13:42.330 --> 13:44.131
Lou, I didn't even know
you made one.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.400
Am I losing my mind
or what?

13:46.467 --> 13:47.768
Tim:
Jack, I just wanna...

13:47.836 --> 13:49.270
Can I just show you this
for a second?

13:49.337 --> 13:50.537
It says right here

13:50.605 --> 13:54.241
that 60 percent
of franchise owners

13:54.309 --> 13:55.809
have no restaurant
experience!

13:55.876 --> 13:56.976
Well, terrific.

13:57.044 --> 13:58.544
That's just the place
I'd go to eat.

13:58.612 --> 13:59.679
I put it on the counter
to cool.

13:59.746 --> 14:00.780
Grandpa,
you must have seen it.

14:00.848 --> 14:02.882
Lou,
I didn't see it!

14:02.950 --> 14:04.717
This reno is actually
making me crazy.

14:04.785 --> 14:06.953
You have too much
on your plate!

14:07.922 --> 14:10.523
The man of the family
has to take responsibility.

14:10.590 --> 14:11.990
Lou:
Dad, what century are we in?

14:12.058 --> 14:13.358
Tim: It doesn't matter
what century we're in,

14:13.426 --> 14:14.592
that's what guy's do.
That's what I'm doing.

14:14.660 --> 14:15.894
I'm taking
responsibility.

14:15.962 --> 14:18.730
(Chuckling) Well, that
would be a first.

14:18.798 --> 14:20.132
Okay,
I have some news.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.967
Can a proud father
share some news?

14:22.035 --> 14:23.702
<i>Shane has been accepted</i>

14:23.769 --> 14:25.737
<i>into a private school</i>
<i>for the gifted.</i>

14:25.805 --> 14:26.972
That's great.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.639
Tim:
But the tuition's pretty high

14:28.707 --> 14:29.773
and Miranda can't afford it,

14:29.842 --> 14:32.443
so that is why
I'm steppin' up!

14:32.510 --> 14:34.411
It's what father's do.

14:34.479 --> 14:37.815
<i>Jack:</i> <i>Oh, that's where this</i>
<i>Buff Burger thing comes in.</i>

14:37.883 --> 14:39.416
I get it now.

14:39.484 --> 14:41.552
Buff Burger?
What're we talking about here?

14:41.619 --> 14:43.520
<i>Tim:</i> <i>We're talking about</i>
<i>a success story, okay?</i>

14:43.588 --> 14:45.455
<i>And you -</i>
<i>you should get Lisa involved.</i>

14:45.522 --> 14:47.490
She's got deep pockets.
You should call her right now.

14:47.558 --> 14:49.326
I'm not spendin' money

14:49.393 --> 14:51.494
on a long distance phone call
to France

14:51.562 --> 14:53.830
just to talk to Lisa
about Buff Burgers!

14:53.898 --> 14:55.165
Right there,
right there,

14:55.233 --> 14:57.500
you're gettin' buried
in the small stuff, Jack.

14:57.568 --> 14:59.769
Amy: You guys, Phoenix
is absolutely amazing!

14:59.837 --> 15:00.870
I mean,
he is a natural born jumper!

15:00.937 --> 15:02.371
You should've seen him!

15:02.438 --> 15:04.306
Lou: Yeah, except don't
you have a date?

15:04.374 --> 15:05.507
Um, right.

15:09.179 --> 15:13.048
Amy has a date with Ty.

15:13.116 --> 15:14.449
So?

15:15.285 --> 15:17.752
Apparently,
it's a special occasion date.

15:18.938 --> 15:20.956
What?

15:21.088 --> 15:22.156
Nothin'.

15:28.264 --> 15:29.898
(Horse chomps loudly)

15:31.267 --> 15:32.832
All right. Enough.

15:37.372 --> 15:39.472
Get...
Get back in there!

15:41.742 --> 15:43.777
(Snorts) God...

15:48.148 --> 15:49.115
<i>(Whistles appreciatively)</i>

15:49.182 --> 15:52.318
Must be a pretty special date.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.320
You shouldn't be out here
in your nice stuff.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.255
I just came
to check on Phoenix.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.157
Well, I just fed him.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.192
He eats twice as much
as the other horses would.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.260
I know.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.830
You have a great time tonight.

16:09.001 --> 16:10.201
Amy...

16:15.007 --> 16:16.474
Agh! Nothin'.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.077
Don't get your shoes
dirty out here now.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.177
(Laughs)

16:21.479 --> 16:22.712
Hey, you.

16:22.780 --> 16:25.115
You ready to do some more
jumpin' tomorrow?

16:25.183 --> 16:28.118
Hmm?
You seem to like that.

16:28.186 --> 16:30.054
(Footsteps creak overhead)

16:32.690 --> 16:33.690
Ty?

16:36.226 --> 16:37.160
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Amy?</i>

16:38.528 --> 16:39.762
Amy, you up here?

16:39.830 --> 16:42.098
Amy:
Yeah, I... just heard a noise,

16:42.166 --> 16:43.132
like someone walking
across the floor.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.868
I just thought
it was you.

16:45.936 --> 16:47.203
You look beautiful.

16:47.271 --> 16:48.904
Thank you.

16:48.973 --> 16:50.606
Come on,
I made a reservation.

16:50.674 --> 16:51.607
A reservation?

16:51.675 --> 16:53.308
- Yeah.
- Fancy.

16:54.277 --> 16:55.743
Ty: I actually, I'm gonna um...

16:55.811 --> 16:57.346
I'm gonna meet you downstairs.

16:57.413 --> 16:59.348
I just gotta get my um...

16:59.415 --> 17:00.815
Uh, my wallet.

17:00.883 --> 17:02.017
Amy: Okay.
Ty: Okay.

17:02.085 --> 17:03.918
Amy:
Okay. (Chuckles)

17:15.130 --> 17:16.396
(Exhales nervously)

17:17.432 --> 17:18.565
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Ty?</i>

17:19.567 --> 17:20.601
Comin'!

17:26.540 --> 17:27.839
Amy:
Thank you!

17:32.446 --> 17:34.680
<i>(Truck door opens and closes,</i>
<i>engine starts)</i>

17:36.083 --> 17:37.583
<i>(Truck rumbles away)</i>

17:56.715 --> 17:57.715
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

17:59.151 --> 18:01.119
I know that expression.

18:02.987 --> 18:04.687
What's on your mind?

18:08.259 --> 18:09.760
Your dad's right,
you know.

18:09.827 --> 18:11.294
You got way too much
goin' on.

18:11.328 --> 18:12.729
Lou:
Honey...

18:12.797 --> 18:17.400
With Katie, your job,
and now this money pit, it's...

18:17.468 --> 18:19.168
I'm fine.

18:19.236 --> 18:20.435
(Sighs heavily)
Peter...

18:20.503 --> 18:22.471
I'm fine, okay?

18:24.074 --> 18:25.841
I'm dealing... sort of.

18:28.011 --> 18:28.878
You know, I still don't know
what happened

18:28.945 --> 18:30.445
with that lasagna,
though.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.815
Seriously, it's a good thing
we had stew left over.

18:32.883 --> 18:33.983
It's my damn job.

18:34.050 --> 18:35.449
It's a good job!

18:35.484 --> 18:37.351
Yeah and if I wasn't going
back and forth to Vancouver

18:37.419 --> 18:39.720
all the time,
I could be here,

18:39.755 --> 18:41.256
you know,
to keep things moving,

18:41.323 --> 18:44.192
light a fire under Dom
and his guys...

18:44.260 --> 18:45.760
Lou:
Okay, first of all,

18:45.828 --> 18:48.396
it would take a cattle prod
to get Dom moving.

18:48.463 --> 18:51.098
Secondly,
he is the only game in town

18:51.166 --> 18:54.401
and we are doing
the best we can, okay?

18:54.468 --> 18:55.936
And the house will get done...

18:56.905 --> 18:58.305
Sometime...

18:58.372 --> 19:00.573
Before Katie goes to college.

19:00.641 --> 19:01.675
(Laughs)

19:06.047 --> 19:07.479
(Loud bang,
Katie cries)

19:07.547 --> 19:09.515
Oh, my God,
she's fallen out of her crib!

19:09.582 --> 19:11.017
(Katie cries)

19:11.084 --> 19:13.452
Honey? Oh, hi.
It's okay, honey.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.288
(Katie cries)
Shhhh!

19:15.355 --> 19:16.655
Peter:
It's freezing in here.

19:19.026 --> 19:21.060
<i>Lou:</i> <i>Shh, shh, shh, shh!
</i> <i>(Katie cries)</i>

19:21.128 --> 19:22.528
Peter:
It must have blown open.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.895
<i>Lou:</i> <i>How can it
open</i> <i>just like that?</i>

19:23.963 --> 19:25.697
Peter: It's probably
not latched properly.

19:25.764 --> 19:28.800
What? No, it was fine.
I checked it.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.668
(Katie cries)
Shh...

19:30.736 --> 19:32.337
Peter, I did,
I checked it.

19:32.404 --> 19:33.538
Okay, okay.

19:35.374 --> 19:37.242
(Low murmur of voices)

19:39.477 --> 19:40.945
Amy:
That was really good.

19:41.012 --> 19:42.046
Ty:
Yeah.

19:43.081 --> 19:45.582
(Nervous)
Yeah, it was.

19:46.584 --> 19:47.985
Are you okay?

19:48.954 --> 19:51.455
You're kind of sweating.

19:51.522 --> 19:53.958
Oh, sorry about that.

19:54.025 --> 19:55.826
Food was, uh,

19:55.893 --> 19:57.661
a little spicy hot,
you know.

19:57.729 --> 19:59.162
Yeah, but good,
right?

19:59.230 --> 20:01.865
Yeah,
it was really good.

20:05.970 --> 20:07.404
So...

20:07.472 --> 20:09.973
What's special?

20:10.040 --> 20:11.574
What?

20:11.641 --> 20:14.209
Well, you had said that this
was a special time of year

20:14.277 --> 20:16.311
and I was just wondering why.

20:17.547 --> 20:22.017
Well, um...
I've been thinkin'.

20:22.085 --> 20:23.486
It's kind of hard
to believe,

20:23.553 --> 20:26.655
but it's been five years
since I came to Heartland.

20:26.723 --> 20:28.122
Wow.

20:28.190 --> 20:30.492
So it's kind of like a...

20:30.559 --> 20:32.193
Like an anniversary,
you know?

20:32.261 --> 20:33.661
- Uh, kind of, yeah.
- Yeah.

20:35.063 --> 20:37.432
And, I mean, we've...

20:37.500 --> 20:39.501
We've come so far
since then.

20:39.568 --> 20:41.469
Yeah.

20:41.537 --> 20:43.437
Um...
(Exhales nervously)

20:47.308 --> 20:50.243
I just want you
to know...

20:51.345 --> 20:53.914
I just wanna say-
(Glass clanks)

20:53.981 --> 20:55.549
Oh! Damn!
Are you okay?

20:55.617 --> 20:57.250
Yeah, it's fine.

20:57.318 --> 20:59.152
Ty: Why are there so many
knives and forks on this table?

20:59.220 --> 21:00.486
Patrons: (Laughing) Oh,
that's so embarassing!

21:08.995 --> 21:10.029
(Sighs heavily)

21:12.332 --> 21:13.633
(Door slams shut,
Lou gasps sharply)

21:13.700 --> 21:15.667
Oh, jeez,
you scared me!

21:15.735 --> 21:16.902
You're jumpy.

21:16.969 --> 21:18.437
Yeah, it's been
kind of a weird

21:18.504 --> 21:19.571
and jumpy night.

21:19.639 --> 21:21.873
Tell me about it.

21:21.941 --> 21:24.275
How was your date?
Was it fun?

21:24.343 --> 21:25.977
Yeah, fun. It was...

21:26.045 --> 21:27.145
Yeah?

21:28.113 --> 21:30.315
It was okay,

21:30.382 --> 21:32.883
but can I tell you
something?

21:32.951 --> 21:34.452
Yes, yes. Sit.

21:34.519 --> 21:35.653
Okay, um...

21:36.588 --> 21:40.090
- Do you remember my audition?
- What?

21:40.158 --> 21:41.859
Um, my Dark Horse audition.

21:41.927 --> 21:43.694
Oh, yeah,
that was my anniversary.

21:43.762 --> 21:44.829
Well, that night

21:44.896 --> 21:46.163
Ty and I had the house
to ourselves,

21:46.230 --> 21:48.465
and he went outside
to get firewood

21:48.532 --> 21:49.866
and then his phone rang

21:49.934 --> 21:51.167
so I reached into his pocket
to answer his phone

21:51.234 --> 21:53.202
and I found-
I found um...

21:54.304 --> 21:56.773
What?
What did you find?

21:57.908 --> 21:59.008
A ring.

22:01.679 --> 22:03.012
Wow! A, a...

22:03.080 --> 22:05.514
Like an engagement ring.

22:05.582 --> 22:07.115
Oh.

22:07.183 --> 22:08.550
Uh... (Exhales)

22:08.618 --> 22:09.918
What did-
what did you do?

22:09.986 --> 22:12.855
I just put it back
and I didn't tell him,

22:12.922 --> 22:14.122
and that was months ago

22:14.190 --> 22:15.724
and he hasn't said
one word since.

22:15.792 --> 22:17.526
Not one word!

22:17.594 --> 22:19.094
And then I thought maybe tonight
would be the night

22:19.161 --> 22:21.195
and it wasn't and...

22:22.197 --> 22:24.465
Lou, what did I do
to make him change his mind?

22:24.533 --> 22:25.700
Oh, honey.

22:27.068 --> 22:29.136
Oh my God,
you can't tell Ty.

22:29.204 --> 22:31.071
Amy, I won't.
I promise I won't.

22:31.139 --> 22:33.007
You are the worst
at keeping secrets!

22:33.074 --> 22:34.074
No.

22:34.142 --> 22:36.442
I promise I'm...

22:36.511 --> 22:37.878
I'm good.

22:38.579 --> 22:40.279
<i>(Banging on door)</i>
<i>Ty, are you there?</i>

22:40.347 --> 22:42.415
(Hard clank,
Ty grunts in pain)

22:42.483 --> 22:44.150
(Groans)
God, the door's open!

22:47.354 --> 22:48.822
Lou:
Ty...

22:48.890 --> 22:50.289
What is going on?

22:51.258 --> 22:52.290
Ty:
What do you mean?

22:52.358 --> 22:53.458
Lou:
You know what I mean, Ty.

22:53.527 --> 22:55.628
You, Amy, romantic date,

22:55.695 --> 22:57.897
kind of thought there might be
a reason for it, you know?

22:57.964 --> 22:59.431
Just say what you wanna say,
Lou.

22:59.499 --> 23:01.700
Why haven't you asked Amy yet?

23:01.768 --> 23:03.002
Ty:
I... (Loud bang)

23:03.069 --> 23:05.738
Lou:
Why didn't you follow through?

23:08.441 --> 23:10.042
Why are you asking me this?

23:10.109 --> 23:12.310
Lou: Because Amy was so
keyed up about that date

23:12.378 --> 23:13.311
that it think
she might have thought

23:13.379 --> 23:15.914
there was a reason for it.

23:15.981 --> 23:17.382
You didn't tell her anything,
did you?

23:17.450 --> 23:19.551
Lou: No, I have not
breathed a word to Amy

23:19.618 --> 23:20.685
and neither has Grampa,

23:20.753 --> 23:22.754
and it has not been easy,
okay?

23:22.821 --> 23:25.256
Good. I'd appreciate it
if you kept it that way.

23:25.323 --> 23:27.958
Why?
Did you change your mind?

23:28.026 --> 23:31.962
No, Lou, I think about every day
and it's driving me crazy!

23:32.030 --> 23:35.999
Well, I know my sister
and I think she's ready.

23:37.869 --> 23:39.836
How do you know that?

23:39.904 --> 23:43.506
Just don't let it
go down the drain, okay?

23:43.574 --> 23:44.740
I gotta go.

23:44.808 --> 23:45.975
Ty:
Wait, just hold on a second.

23:46.043 --> 23:47.377
Lou:
What?

23:47.445 --> 23:50.780
Are you sure about this?
Are you sure she's ready?

23:50.847 --> 23:51.981
Yes, I am.

23:57.787 --> 23:59.387
♪

24:06.027 --> 24:07.228
Hup!

24:21.476 --> 24:23.343
You're such a good boy.

and whinnies sharply)

Ty:
Hey, you okay?

24:58.410 --> 25:00.111
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:01.046 --> 25:02.813
Are you sure
you're all right?

25:02.881 --> 25:05.183
I'm good.
I just, I don't get it.

25:05.251 --> 25:06.716
Phoenix loves to jump,

25:06.784 --> 25:10.621
but obviously not so much
with me on his back.

25:11.922 --> 25:13.823
Well, I just, uh, came by
to get some tools.

25:13.891 --> 25:17.261
Um...

25:17.328 --> 25:19.896
Hey, tonight, are you, um,
are you busy?

25:19.964 --> 25:23.332
Um, I was thinkin' maybe
we could go on a date again.

25:25.302 --> 25:26.502
I promise I won't spill
any more water on you

25:26.570 --> 25:28.737
this time.

25:28.805 --> 25:32.508
Two dates in two days...
What's goin' on?

25:36.112 --> 25:38.313
Okay...

25:38.381 --> 25:39.747
(Exhales nervously)

25:44.620 --> 25:45.987
(Exhales nervously)

25:53.729 --> 25:54.961
(Toiletries clatter)

25:57.699 --> 25:59.533
(Drawer squeaks
and bangs loudly)

26:00.502 --> 26:01.535
No.

26:03.104 --> 26:04.137
No.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.241
(Rifles through bag,
frantically searching)

26:08.210 --> 26:09.276
(Distressed)
Agh!

26:12.180 --> 26:13.814
(Distressed exhale)

26:17.106 --> 26:19.642
<i>Oh, Amy,</i>
<i>you should wear this one!</i>

26:19.709 --> 26:21.877
I'm not wearing a dress.
I wore one last night.

26:21.945 --> 26:23.111
I'm wearing jeans.

26:23.179 --> 26:24.346
No, no. You have
to look different

26:24.414 --> 26:25.681
than you do every day.

26:25.749 --> 26:27.282
(Knocking at door)

26:28.785 --> 26:30.253
Hey, I was looking for you.

26:30.321 --> 26:31.820
Well, you found me.

26:31.887 --> 26:33.088
Uh, no, Lou.

26:33.156 --> 26:35.723
Um, can I talk to you
for a second?

26:35.791 --> 26:36.992
Yeah. Yup.

26:39.329 --> 26:43.131
(Under her breath)
Wear the dress.

26:43.199 --> 26:45.367
Lou: How could it be gone, Ty?
I mean, how could you lose it?!

26:45.935 --> 26:48.435
I didn't lose it, Lou!
It was here this morning!

26:48.503 --> 26:50.203
It was in this!

26:50.271 --> 26:51.304
I didn't want to keep it
in the trailer

26:51.372 --> 26:52.439
so I kept it safe
in the drawer

26:52.507 --> 26:53.941
and now it's gone!
Someone stole it!

26:54.008 --> 26:56.276
Ty, nobody stole it.
How could somebody steal it?

26:56.344 --> 26:57.945
I'm the only one
who knew about it, right?

26:58.012 --> 26:59.546
So it's gotta be here.

26:59.614 --> 27:01.214
Ty: It's not here, Lou!
I've searched everywhere!

27:01.282 --> 27:02.583
I can't find it!

27:02.650 --> 27:03.616
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Ty?</i>

27:08.622 --> 27:09.622
Ty:
Hey.

27:09.690 --> 27:11.657
Amy:
What are you guys doin'?

27:11.725 --> 27:12.925
Ty: Uh, nothing. We, uh...

27:12.993 --> 27:15.027
Um... blankets.
Ty needed more blankets,

27:15.095 --> 27:17.730
'cause super cold
up here at night.

27:17.798 --> 27:19.031
Right, right.

27:19.999 --> 27:21.199
Are you ready?

27:21.266 --> 27:22.567
Yeah, um...

27:24.103 --> 27:25.670
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

27:25.738 --> 27:26.771
Ty:
Okay.

27:29.509 --> 27:31.142
(Exhales nervously)

27:36.515 --> 27:38.248
(Doors bangs shut)

27:38.316 --> 27:39.750
(Door bangs shut)

27:43.522 --> 27:45.856
(Fridge items rattle
as door bangs against counter)

27:50.461 --> 27:51.694
(Floor creaks)

27:52.413 --> 27:53.446
Hello?

28:03.624 --> 28:04.524
(Door creaks
and bangs shut)

28:04.592 --> 28:05.958
(Lou gasps)

28:09.529 --> 28:12.331
There was someone in the house,
Dad, I <i>know it!</i>

28:12.399 --> 28:14.866
Did you actually physically
see anyone, though?

28:14.934 --> 28:16.134
Lou:
Okay, not technically,

28:16.202 --> 28:17.803
but the fridge door
was swinging open,

28:17.870 --> 28:19.171
and the side door,

28:19.238 --> 28:20.406
somebody absolutely
went out through it!

28:20.473 --> 28:21.740
Okay.

28:21.808 --> 28:24.008
I'm worried.

28:24.075 --> 28:26.010
Honey, listen,
you're hearing things,

28:26.077 --> 28:30.014
and you're losing things,
and you're seeing things.

28:30.081 --> 28:32.183
I think you're under
a lot of stress.

28:32.250 --> 28:34.118
Yes, Dad,
I am under a lot of stress,

28:34.186 --> 28:35.386
and it is even more stressful

28:35.454 --> 28:37.655
when people don't believe me!
You guys!

28:37.723 --> 28:38.823
Okay, listen,
honey,

28:38.890 --> 28:40.056
it's not that
we don't believe you, okay?

28:40.124 --> 28:41.725
But we have looked
everywhere

28:41.793 --> 28:43.827
and there's no sign
anyone's been on the property,

28:43.894 --> 28:48.865
and even if there was,
they're long gone by now.

28:48.933 --> 28:49.933
Lou:
(Sighs)

28:56.506 --> 28:57.707

(Sighs)

28:59.776 --> 29:01.210
(Truck turns off)

29:06.550 --> 29:07.950
(Awkward chuckle)

29:08.017 --> 29:11.419
That was a pretty good
movie, huh?

29:11.487 --> 29:13.988
Yeah, I love
action movies.

29:14.957 --> 29:16.257
(Sighs heavily)

29:18.961 --> 29:21.062
Can I ask you a question?

29:22.565 --> 29:23.865
Yeah, sure.

29:25.868 --> 29:28.301
Amy: You know the night of
my Dark Horse audition?

29:28.370 --> 29:31.304
Uh, yeah,
I remember it really well.

29:31.373 --> 29:32.406
Really well.

29:35.042 --> 29:38.111
'Cause I can't help
but think and...

29:38.179 --> 29:40.881
I could be...
I could be crazy, but...

29:42.984 --> 29:46.719
I feel like something changed
between us that night.

29:47.688 --> 29:49.288
Really?

29:49.356 --> 29:51.056
Do you feel that?

29:52.760 --> 29:53.793
Uh... no.

29:55.629 --> 29:58.230
My feelings haven't changed
at all.

29:58.298 --> 29:59.431
Have yours?

29:59.499 --> 30:01.733
No. No.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.336
So we're all good?

30:06.305 --> 30:07.972
Yeah, we're all good.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.040
Amy:
Okay.

30:10.675 --> 30:12.343
Okay.

30:12.411 --> 30:13.677
Thanks for tonight.

30:26.557 --> 30:27.590

30:38.468 --> 30:42.371
<i>(Ty hears a loud sneeze</i>
<i>and floorboards creaking)</i>

30:45.742 --> 30:47.109

30:52.615 --> 30:54.316
(Relieved exhale)

30:59.155 --> 31:03.124

feet scuff, floorboards creak)

31:20.275 --> 31:22.009

31:22.077 --> 31:24.078
Hey, hey.
What're you doing up here?

31:24.145 --> 31:25.645

Ungh!

31:25.713 --> 31:26.912
Hey!

31:26.981 --> 31:28.614
(Running footsteps)

31:30.150 --> 31:31.084
Hey! Hey!

31:31.151 --> 31:33.019
(Horse whinnies nervously)

31:33.988 --> 31:35.388
Come here!

31:35.456 --> 31:36.489
Agh!

31:37.458 --> 31:38.491
Kid:
Ungh!

31:39.860 --> 31:41.361
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!</i>

31:41.428 --> 31:42.361
You don't wanna
do that, okay?

31:42.428 --> 31:43.728
Okay.

31:44.697 --> 31:46.365
Easy.

31:46.432 --> 31:48.266

Ty and kid struggle)

32:00.221 --> 32:03.624
Jack: Maybe we could
start with your name.

32:05.960 --> 32:08.562
Okay,
how about a phone number?

32:12.734 --> 32:14.601
Now, listen,

32:14.669 --> 32:18.137
I don't want to involve
the police here,

32:18.204 --> 32:21.039
but I have to phone
your folks.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.408
I mean, they gotta be
pretty upset

32:22.476 --> 32:24.577
not knowin' where you are,
don't you think?

32:24.645 --> 32:26.245
There's probably people
out there right now

32:26.313 --> 32:28.281
looking for ya,

32:28.348 --> 32:30.916
and you're probably afraid
of the consequences of that.

32:30.984 --> 32:34.786
You know, what they'll say
and what they'll do...

32:39.825 --> 32:42.994
<i>'Cause I know you're pretty</i>
<i>darn scared right now.</i>

32:43.061 --> 32:44.195
I'm not scared.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.130
Okay. See?
You do have a voice.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.835
<i>How about a name now?</i>

32:50.903 --> 32:52.270
My name is Georgie.

32:53.238 --> 32:55.673
I'm not going back.

32:58.643 --> 32:59.710
Well, you're not
goin' anywhere

32:59.778 --> 33:03.014
this time of night,
that's for sure.

33:03.081 --> 33:06.183
Maybe we could set up
a cot in Amy's room.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.018
<i>Can we do that?</i>

33:12.556 --> 33:15.025
Tim:
Okay, first giant step taken:

33:15.960 --> 33:17.527
Got an appointment
with Buff Chomski,

33:17.594 --> 33:19.062
CEO of Buff Burger.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.595
And I tracked down
that real estate agent,

33:20.663 --> 33:21.630
you know,
that has the vacant lot

33:21.698 --> 33:23.065
that I was talkin' about?

33:23.133 --> 33:24.599
Just promise me you're not
gonna sign anything, Dad.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.035
Jack, you comin'
with me?

33:26.102 --> 33:27.336
Jack: What part of
"I'm not interested"

33:27.403 --> 33:28.704
do you not understand?

33:28.771 --> 33:31.673
Besides, we've got a bit
of a situation here.

33:31.741 --> 33:33.542
Hi, Clint, come on in.

33:34.945 --> 33:35.977
Something goin' on
here?

33:36.045 --> 33:37.678
Yeah, Dad,
it's an interesting story

33:37.746 --> 33:40.348
and I will fill you in
over here, come on.

33:40.415 --> 33:42.116
Jack:
So thanks for comin', Clint.

33:42.184 --> 33:43.952
No problem, Jack,
I go where I'm needed.

33:44.019 --> 33:45.786
Well, I didn't know
who else to call.

33:45.855 --> 33:48.456
I know you've got experience
with kids like this

33:48.523 --> 33:50.458
and thought maybe
you could find out

33:50.525 --> 33:54.194
who she is
and where she came from.

33:54.262 --> 33:55.462
I already know
who she is.

33:55.529 --> 33:56.864
I just got an email
from her social worker.

33:56.931 --> 33:58.498
Her name
is Georgina Crawley.

33:58.566 --> 34:00.800
She's 11-years-old.

34:00.869 --> 34:02.135
She's been in
the foster care system

34:02.203 --> 34:04.537
since she was three.

34:04.605 --> 34:06.539
She was recently transferred
to a family in Okotoks.

34:06.607 --> 34:09.175
She disappeared
the day before yesterday.

34:09.243 --> 34:11.777
I was in Okotoks
day before yesterday.

34:11.844 --> 34:14.679
She must have hitched a ride
in the back of my truck.

34:14.748 --> 34:17.183
Well, the fact is
she's a habitual runaway.

34:17.251 --> 34:19.217
Where is she now?

34:45.342 --> 34:46.710
(Giggles)

35:00.424 --> 35:01.857
(Phone keys beep)

35:08.832 --> 35:11.700
Jeff! You're there!

35:11.768 --> 35:13.201
It's me, Georgie.

35:15.171 --> 35:17.739
Very funny.
Yeah, your sister.

35:17.807 --> 35:20.208
Who else did you think it was?

35:21.177 --> 35:25.780
So, um, how was Fort Mac?
You got a job yet?

35:27.350 --> 35:29.550
That's good.
That's really good...

35:29.617 --> 35:33.620
'Cause, um,
well, I was thinking

35:33.688 --> 35:36.057
maybe I travel up there.

35:37.025 --> 35:39.093
No, not to visit.

35:39.161 --> 35:42.430
I mean, maybe I could
come live with you.

35:43.398 --> 35:45.065
Jeffy?

35:45.132 --> 35:46.967
Jeff, you there?

35:47.901 --> 35:51.504
No! It's not better for me
with that family!

35:52.439 --> 35:56.576
No! It's just they smell bad
and they don't listen to me!

35:59.813 --> 36:02.314
(Tearful)
Jeff, please!

36:04.485 --> 36:06.284
Okay.

36:06.352 --> 36:08.753
Fine, I get it.

36:08.821 --> 36:10.889
You don't want me.

36:10.957 --> 36:12.524
It is so true.

36:15.361 --> 36:17.762
Fine! Bye!

36:17.830 --> 36:20.799
(Phone beeps off,
clunks back on cradle)

36:24.168 --> 36:25.369
(Tearful sigh)

36:36.014 --> 36:38.615
Jack:
Georgina, this is Clint Riley.

36:39.650 --> 36:41.050
<i>Clint:</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

36:41.118 --> 36:42.485
<i>Georgina, I'm a liaison</i>

36:42.553 --> 36:46.022
with the Hudson County
Child Service Program.

36:46.957 --> 36:48.691
I just spoke with
Mr. and Mrs. Caffazo,

36:48.759 --> 36:49.859
your foster parents,

36:49.927 --> 36:51.628
and, you know,
I can tell you

36:51.695 --> 36:53.929
they're pretty darn relieved
to know that you're safe.

36:53.997 --> 36:55.397
<i>They can't wait to see you.</i>

36:55.464 --> 36:56.798
Clint says he'd be happy

36:56.866 --> 36:59.968
to drive you back home
to Okotoks.

37:00.870 --> 37:04.540
<i>Clint:</i>
<i>So why don't we hit the road?</i>

37:09.211 --> 37:12.079
Jack: So you take care
of yourself, young lady.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.348
You see, there were people
out there lookin' for you.

37:14.416 --> 37:15.616
I told you so.

37:23.525 --> 37:25.125
Clint, thanks.

37:25.193 --> 37:26.693
Clint:
No problem.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.232
(Car starts up)

37:39.740 --> 37:41.774
<i>(Muted high-pitched whinny)</i>

37:51.217 --> 37:52.751
(Cell phone rings)

37:55.822 --> 37:57.822
(Car slows to a stop)

38:00.593 --> 38:02.493
<i>Clint:</i>
<i>Oh, shoot!</i>

38:04.029 --> 38:05.063
<i>Georgina!</i>

38:07.700 --> 38:08.800
Georgina, no!

38:11.670 --> 38:12.704
Georgina!

38:19.043 --> 38:20.777
(Spartan gallops)

38:22.480 --> 38:23.580
Amy:
Georgie!

38:24.548 --> 38:26.349
Georgie,
tell him "whoa!"

38:27.318 --> 38:28.351
<i>Georgie!</i>

38:30.887 --> 38:32.421
(Hooves thunder)

38:39.997 --> 38:41.063
Phoenix, whoa!

38:42.032 --> 38:43.365
Georgie!

38:43.433 --> 38:44.533
Geez! Georgie!

38:46.869 --> 38:48.302
Georgie!

38:48.370 --> 38:50.805
Georgie:
No! I'm not going back!

38:51.741 --> 38:54.142
(Tearful)
They can't make me!

38:55.111 --> 38:56.144
(Cries)

39:00.488 --> 39:02.455
Grampa, she really doesn't
wanna go

39:02.523 --> 39:03.823
and she's not faking.

39:03.891 --> 39:05.258
I don't see how we can
just send her back!

39:05.326 --> 39:07.359
Amy,
she has to go back.

39:07.427 --> 39:08.927
She has a family.

39:09.896 --> 39:11.330
She wanted to get away
so bad

39:11.398 --> 39:12.964
she almost killed herself
taking off on a horse,

39:13.033 --> 39:15.100
and she doesn't even ride!

39:15.168 --> 39:17.169
Look, I told her that
I would talk to you.

39:17.237 --> 39:18.170
Amy...

39:18.238 --> 39:19.871
I promised!

39:19.939 --> 39:21.540
<i>Clint:</i>
<i>Jack...</i>

39:21.607 --> 39:23.641
Is Georgina around?

39:23.708 --> 39:25.243
She's, um,
she's out in the barn.

39:25.310 --> 39:27.512
I told her
she could brush Phoenix

39:27.579 --> 39:29.914
before she goes back
to Okotoks.

39:31.016 --> 39:32.883
Clint:
Uh, well, actually,

39:32.951 --> 39:35.486
<i>I won't be taking Georgina</i>
<i>back to Okotoks.</i>

39:35.554 --> 39:36.820
Oh?

39:36.888 --> 39:38.089
Due diligence, Jack.

39:38.157 --> 39:40.157
I discovered that
Mr. and Mrs. Cafazzo,

39:40.224 --> 39:41.724
contrary to what
they first avowed,

39:41.792 --> 39:45.895
they did not, in fact,
report Georgina missing.

39:45.963 --> 39:47.531
And that's against
paragraph 10, section B,

39:47.598 --> 39:49.366
of the foster parent's
agreement, so...

39:49.434 --> 39:51.068
I have to put Georgina
in a group home

39:51.135 --> 39:53.537
until further arrangements
can be made.

39:53.604 --> 39:55.004
No, Grampa.

39:58.808 --> 40:01.577
She can stay here
for a couple of days.

40:01.644 --> 40:04.213
<i>Clint: Really?</i>
<i>Jack: Yeah, I guess.</i>

40:04.281 --> 40:06.382
Clint:
Well, Jack,

40:06.450 --> 40:08.016
having witnessed
the success you've had

40:08.085 --> 40:09.485
with troubled youth
in the past,

40:09.553 --> 40:11.053
I'd have no trouble finding
the proper paperwork

40:11.120 --> 40:12.420
for you to sign.

40:12.488 --> 40:14.289
Only until you can find
something more suitable.

40:14.356 --> 40:15.523
Duly noted.

40:15.591 --> 40:17.292
Duly noted.

40:17.359 --> 40:18.393
Okay.

40:20.162 --> 40:21.862
Thank you, Jack.

40:26.535 --> 40:28.569
(Approaching footsteps)

40:28.637 --> 40:32.172
Jack:
Okay, here's the deal.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.841
Now, if you want,
you can stay here

40:33.909 --> 40:35.375
for a few days.

40:35.443 --> 40:37.111
<i>If that's okay with you.</i>

40:38.847 --> 40:40.681
<i>Now, Clint's gonna look</i>
<i>at your situation.</i>

40:40.749 --> 40:42.216
He's gonna figure out
what's best for you

40:42.283 --> 40:44.283
and for all concerned,

40:44.351 --> 40:46.285
and then you have to do
what he recommends.

40:46.353 --> 40:48.387
Do you understand that?

40:49.657 --> 40:51.825
<i>'Cause until you're older</i>
<i>than you are right now,</i>

40:51.892 --> 40:54.060
<i>somebody's gotta</i>
<i>look after you.</i>

40:54.128 --> 40:55.495
I can look after myself.

40:55.562 --> 40:56.763
Oh, right.

40:56.831 --> 40:57.764
And another thing,
Georgina-

40:57.832 --> 40:59.865
My name is Georgie.

41:00.834 --> 41:02.434
Georgie.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.503
No more runnin' away,
you hear me?

41:04.570 --> 41:06.338
And no more jumping out
of moving cars!

41:06.405 --> 41:08.774
It wasn't even moving.

41:14.480 --> 41:16.781
Thanks for letting me stay,
Mr. Bartlett.

41:20.519 --> 41:21.753

41:52.015 --> 41:54.249
When we took down the old walls
in the living room

41:54.317 --> 41:56.117
we found something
a little interesting.

41:56.186 --> 41:57.452

you found a bunch of cash

Where did you
find that?

In the loft.

put it.

I was thinking maybe you could
put it in the loft somewhere
