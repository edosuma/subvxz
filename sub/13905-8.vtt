00:00.280 --> 00:02.460
Stephanie's in at Her Majesty's
pleasure.

00:02.495 --> 00:04.640
Take care of the business
for a few days.

00:04.675 --> 00:06.245
Yeah. It's Ã£250 an hour.

00:06.280 --> 00:08.885
I'm not a madam. Just helping out
an old friend.

00:08.920 --> 00:12.600
I need some new supplies. Whips,
handcuffs. I'll get you a list.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.645
So, you are a fucking whore?

00:14.680 --> 00:18.080
That's enough. Hannah's gone out of
her way to look after you.

00:18.115 --> 00:19.245
Thank you.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.240
What for?
Standing up for me.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.920
Our other relationships,
they're fine.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.520
But they're not real.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.640
You can do anything you want.

00:30.675 --> 00:32.564
I've never lied to Ben.

00:32.600 --> 00:37.240
Hannah, I'm really worried about you now,
so, just call me when you get this, please.

00:37.275 --> 00:39.880
Maybe we should just try
and be like good friends.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.160
You'd best go home, Belle.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.200
This isn't you, Hannah.
Just kiss me, Ben, please.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.760
Are you OK?

01:00.120 --> 01:02.880
In life, our past
always catches up with us.

01:05.840 --> 01:08.400
And we have to ask ourselves
what we really want.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.800
After all, every decision
has consequences.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.840
And there's always
a day of reckoning.

Sync and corrected by

02:03.920 --> 02:06.960
I don't know why, but I've always
found courtrooms sexy.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.080
Maybe it's the outfits.

02:13.640 --> 02:17.200
Maybe it's that...that building sense
of jeopardy.

02:17.235 --> 02:19.160
(GAVEL BANGS)

02:19.600 --> 02:23.600
We, the jury, find the defendant,
Stephanie Charlton...

02:23.635 --> 02:25.760
Or maybe...maybe it's something else.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.480
(HEAVY BREATHING)

02:30.840 --> 02:32.700
..guilty.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.525
(GASPING)

02:34.560 --> 02:37.000
The deal was, you promised
you'd get her off.

02:37.035 --> 02:38.405
Exciting, isn't it?

02:38.440 --> 02:41.920
Well, no, not really. I only agreed
to take over for a few weeks.

02:41.955 --> 02:44.840
Trust me. This one's completely
under control.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.245
She has no history
of any previous convictions.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.720
And indeed, has spent a lengthy
period in custody awaiting trial.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.560
And I see no reason to detain her
further.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.360
Miss Charlton, you're free to go.

03:03.360 --> 03:05.040
You bad...
Yes.

03:05.075 --> 03:06.685
..bad...
Yes.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.920
..bad judge!
Yes! Yes!

03:09.800 --> 03:11.760
Stephanie...

03:13.080 --> 03:14.365
Stephanie.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.645
Congratulations.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.400
Some jailbirds' wings
just can never be clipped.

03:18.435 --> 03:20.720
I'm having a little party tonight.

03:21.680 --> 03:22.805
For you.

03:22.840 --> 03:26.280
Me? Just my way of saying thank you
for everything you've done.

03:26.315 --> 03:27.725
You didn't have to.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.000
Never let it be said
I don't repay my debts.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.520
Oh, yes.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.280
See you tonight.

03:48.040 --> 03:50.000
Oh, shit.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.765
So, this is Ben.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.760
Yeah. Ben, this is Harry.
Shall we get going?

03:59.920 --> 04:01.880
He says you two
have worked together.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.565
Yeah, we...sort of,

04:05.600 --> 04:07.560
I mean, it was...a long time ago.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.725
She helped me out on some police
business. Yeah.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.920
Nothing untoward. She was very
professional at all times.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.880
Well, I'll leave you to it.

04:18.915 --> 04:20.084
All right.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.079
Very nice to meet you.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.845
Belle.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.560
Always a pleasure.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.360
What was that all about?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.480
Nothing.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.760
Do you want some lunch?
Who was that guy?

04:35.640 --> 04:37.800
I told you, he's a friend of
Stephanie's.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.240
Come on. There's this really good
place just down the road.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.840
I've got to go to work.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.445
Ben, will you just stop, please?

04:52.480 --> 04:55.640
Look, I know things have been
difficult lately, OK, but...

04:56.360 --> 04:59.645
Stephanie's out now, and things
can just go back to normal.

04:59.680 --> 05:03.440
Normal? A few days ago, you leave
a freaked-out message on my phone,

05:03.475 --> 05:06.400
disappear for hours, I still don't
know what happened.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.520
What's it going to be next week?
It's my job, Ben.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.040
I'm not sure how much more I can
take.

05:14.075 --> 05:15.165
Oh, come on.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.140
Other people know where their
girlfriends are at night.

05:18.175 --> 05:21.080
What do you want me to do?
Shall I just give up my job?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.120
Why should I give up my job?

05:35.080 --> 05:37.040
I love my job.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.365
My job is who I am.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.840
You know, maybe I was right all
along. No man can handle what I do.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.400
I can handle it.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.700
What are you doing here?

05:49.735 --> 05:51.520
Declaring my allegiance.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.640
This really isn't a good time.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.160
So, this is Hannah.

05:59.840 --> 06:02.600
Wow. Moving up in the world, Hannah.

06:02.635 --> 06:04.560
Very cosy.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.805
Very chic.

06:07.840 --> 06:09.800
I have to go to work in a minute,
Harry.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.920
Not very you, though, is it?

06:14.160 --> 06:16.400
I mean, you're not the stay-at-home
type.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.960
I have a boyfriend.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.365
Ben is my boyfriend.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.360
Yes. He's a boy.
What you need is a man.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.285
Ben is a man.
Really?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.560
Yeah. He looks more like
a skinny kid to me.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.000
He's actually one of the kindest
and...

06:33.960 --> 06:35.960
funniest, most decent people -

06:35.995 --> 06:37.960
Yeah, but he doesn't excite you.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.760
Doesn't get under your skin.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.120
Not like I do.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.000
I've got to go to work.

06:58.035 --> 06:59.605
Fine.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.600
Whatever you say.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.560
But I know who you are, Belle.

07:06.520 --> 07:09.560
And right now, you're trying to be
something you're not.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.560
I'm not trying to be someone I'm not.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.240
I know exactly who I am,
and exactly what I'm doing.

07:30.560 --> 07:34.200
At home and in work,
I'm totally in control.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.600
Ooh!

07:43.160 --> 07:44.605
You must be Belle.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.880
Yeah. Sorry. You're Lewis, right?

07:48.280 --> 07:49.520
Right.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.000
I just got my heel caught.

07:54.920 --> 07:57.320
Sorry. Sorry. Come in.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.685
So, Lewis,

08:07.720 --> 08:09.680
what can I do for you today?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.805
Whatever you want.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.800
No, I believe the deal here is...

08:21.480 --> 08:23.440
..whatever you want.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.680
I don't know what I want.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.760
Come on. There must be something.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.000
You can tell me.

08:31.480 --> 08:33.080
Nothing too naughty.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.480
No fantasies?

08:43.720 --> 08:45.680
I like to be tested.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.480
I like it to be hard.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.445
Oh!

08:56.480 --> 08:58.440
Oh, God.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.080
I'm sorry, I...I didn't realise.

09:03.400 --> 09:05.260
I can't believe I just did that.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.085
No, no. It's OK. Don't worry.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.960
That hasn't happened to me since
sixth from, I swear.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.000
Oh, fuck!
Oh!

09:12.760 --> 09:14.005
Fuck!

09:14.040 --> 09:15.725
I knew it.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.680
Oh...
I know exactly who you are.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.880
You're Hannah Baxter from school.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.760
Cheers.
Cheers.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.320
That's horrible.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.120
So, advertising.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.165
Well...

09:34.200 --> 09:36.200
At least I'm an honest prostitute.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.840
What can I say? I've got a gift.

09:39.560 --> 09:42.120
I can make even Hoovers seem sexy.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.125
What about you?

09:44.160 --> 09:46.120
No, I think I draw the line
at Hoovers.

09:46.760 --> 09:51.680
No, I meant, you could have done
anything. Why choose this?

09:52.720 --> 09:56.080
The same reason you're in
advertising, probably.

09:56.115 --> 09:57.725
I mean...

09:57.760 --> 09:59.760
I'm good at it.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.120
I think, and um...

10:03.320 --> 10:05.280
I just...I enjoy it.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.840
I like getting to know clients.
I like finding out their secrets.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.205
I'm not really a virgin.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.045
I was the animal guy at college.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.320
The last time I had a girlfriend,
I was 17.

10:15.355 --> 10:17.760
Kind of like, a private detective.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.725
Or a priest...ish,

10:21.760 --> 10:23.760
with just, like, better underwear.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.200
Just loads and loads of sex.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.320
Is it really that simple?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.045
Well, no, I never said it was simple.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.320
I'm going out with, I fall in
love with her,

10:37.720 --> 10:40.640
and I walk in and she's fucking
some guy.

10:40.675 --> 10:42.560
You sleep with other men.

10:42.595 --> 10:44.205
It's my job!

10:44.240 --> 10:46.045
It's what I do. It's different.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.840
When are you going to get it? There
is no Belle and there is no Hannah.

10:49.875 --> 10:52.200
It's just you who doesn't know
what you want.

10:54.480 --> 10:56.520
Even though you had braces

10:56.555 --> 10:58.605
and huge teeth,

10:58.640 --> 11:01.040
and you were a bit chubby
in school...

11:02.640 --> 11:04.600
I always had the biggest crush
on you.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.480
Chubby? Wow. (LAUGHS) That's nice.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.360
Sorry.

11:12.395 --> 11:14.240
It's OK.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.120
Shall we have another round?
Yeah.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.120
Cheers.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.760
There's nothing like colliding
with your past...

11:28.560 --> 11:30.560
to help you face your present.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.360
What's going on?
I meant what I said.

11:46.395 --> 11:48.000
I can't take this anymore.

11:48.035 --> 11:49.960
Are you leaving?

11:51.760 --> 11:54.640
When we were just mates,
you told me everything.

11:54.675 --> 11:57.840
About life, about work, no secrets.

12:00.200 --> 12:03.800
Since we got together, it's like
I don't know anything about you.

12:03.835 --> 12:05.760
That's not true.

12:05.795 --> 12:07.760
No?

12:09.600 --> 12:12.120
How honest have we been
with each other lately?

12:13.560 --> 12:16.165
Things have been difficult, Ben.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.340
I'm fine with what you do
for a living. I am.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.480
What I can't deal with
is what it's doing to us.

12:24.360 --> 12:26.320
I don't trust you anymore.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.280
Let's just talk about it.
I can't just change overnight.

12:36.560 --> 12:39.120
Well, I won't go to
Stephanie's tonight.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.680
Please.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.200
No, you go. I'll meet you
afterwards.

12:48.040 --> 12:49.925
Well, when?

12:49.960 --> 12:52.760
Midnight. Our place
on the Embankment.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.205
If you think you're ready to give up
being Belle,

12:57.240 --> 13:00.480
give you and me a shot at a decent
future, you come and meet me.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.200
And if not...

13:07.480 --> 13:10.560
It's your decision, Han.
Who do you want to be?

13:24.040 --> 13:26.000
In life, there is always a moment...

13:27.400 --> 13:29.560
..when your future depends
on a choice.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.980
Hi.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.685
Belle.

14:10.720 --> 14:14.520
There's someone I want you to meet.
My new girlfriend. Sylvia Burke.

14:14.555 --> 14:16.480
Crown Prosecutor. Best there is.

14:16.515 --> 14:18.520
Hello. Nice to meet you.

14:18.555 --> 14:20.565
Have we met before?

14:20.600 --> 14:23.760
I don't think so, but I've heard
a lot about you.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.400
Caught me by the balls in the courtroom
and the bedroom. Fucking exhilarating.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.560
That's wonderful news, Liam.
Well done.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.640
You look sensational.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.200
I need to talk to you.
Very important.

14:40.235 --> 14:42.200
I can't do this right now, Harry.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.280
Sorry.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.280
Charlie, you look...(LAUGHS)

14:49.960 --> 14:52.000
Thank you. This is Marius.

14:52.035 --> 14:53.925
Don't speak to him.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.800
Gosh, you never stop, do you?

14:55.835 --> 14:57.737
Marius is not a client.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.640
Marius is my husband.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.280
Oh.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.920
Come along, Marius.
Time for your walk.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.700
Belle.

15:13.735 --> 15:15.400
Hi.

15:16.600 --> 15:21.200
So, you understand, there was no-one else
I could have trusted the business with?

15:21.235 --> 15:23.325
You're a natural.
Oh, I don't know.

15:23.360 --> 15:26.120
No, you are. You were born for it.
It's in the veins.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.560
Do you mind if I step in?

15:30.595 --> 15:32.177
Be my guest.

15:32.212 --> 15:33.760
Shall we?

15:51.720 --> 15:54.080
You can't run away from me forever,
you know.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.640
I shouldn't be doing this.
Is this what you know you want?

15:58.675 --> 16:01.200
I know what I want. You.

16:01.235 --> 16:03.160
Harry.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.760
Be with me.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
Why me? I mean, you know, there's a big
city out there full of gorgeous women.

16:19.035 --> 16:20.925
Come on.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.920
But there's only one you.

16:31.840 --> 16:33.800
When I'm with you,

16:34.800 --> 16:36.800
I feel alive.

16:36.835 --> 16:38.800
And so do you.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.680
I can't be with you, Harry.
Why?

16:45.715 --> 16:47.525
Why not?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.405
What are you doing instead?

16:49.440 --> 16:51.400
You're never going to
make Ben happy.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.640
You are not that type of girl.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.120
Think about it, Belle.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.645
Me and you, we could go anywhere,
we could do anything.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.880
Think about the adventure. Think about
all the things we could get to explore.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.079
I don't want you to give up
your life.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.359
I just want to have you in mine.

17:22.680 --> 17:23.964
I have to go.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.920
Come back.
I can't. I have to go.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.840
Is this it?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.520
This is it, is it?

18:09.120 --> 18:11.080
You're not coming.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.000
I love you, Ben.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.600
You're my best friend.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.040
And you deserve the best life.

18:32.760 --> 18:34.720
But it's not with me.

18:37.440 --> 18:42.080
I can't give you what you need
and I can't change who I am.

18:42.115 --> 18:44.080
I don't want you to change
who you are.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.000
You deserve so much better than that.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.560
You deserve the best.

18:57.080 --> 18:59.160
You know this is the end, Hannah,
yeah?

19:02.320 --> 19:04.280
We can't go back from this.

19:04.680 --> 19:06.640
âª ADELE: Someone Like You

19:11.400 --> 19:15.040
âª Don't forget me, I beg

19:15.075 --> 19:18.645
âª I remember you said

19:18.680 --> 19:20.640
âª Sometimes it lasts in love

19:20.880 --> 19:25.120
âª But sometimes it hurts instead

19:26.480 --> 19:32.120
âª Never mind,
I'll find someone like you

19:32.880 --> 19:35.980
âª I wish nothing but the best
for you, too.. âª

19:36.015 --> 19:39.080
Some choices we make for ourselves
in life.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.680
And some we make for other people.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.800
Not because we don't love them,

19:47.280 --> 19:49.240
but because we do.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.800
The only way we know it's right is
if it lets us stay true to ourselves.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.600
But we can't regret our choices.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.480
The past is behind us.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.320
All we have is the present.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.440
And the future.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.520
Whatever that may bring.

20:15.680 --> 20:19.100
âª Don't forget me, I beg

20:19.135 --> 20:22.485
âª I remember you said

20:22.520 --> 20:25.820
âª Sometimes it lasts in love

20:25.855 --> 20:29.120
âª But sometimes it hurts instead

20:29.520 --> 20:32.165
âª Sometimes it lasts in love

20:32.200 --> 20:36.680
âª But sometimes it hurts instead,
yeah

20:38.040 --> 20:43.120
âª Never mind,
I'll find someone like you

20:44.080 --> 20:51.000
âª I wish nothing but the best
for you, too

20:51.240 --> 20:54.080
âª Don't forget me, I beg

20:54.400 --> 20:57.925
âª I remember you said

20:57.960 --> 21:01.480
âª Sometimes it lasts in love

âª Sometimes it lasts in love

Take a nice, long bath.

Arrh! Arrh!

Toast her face.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.800
Cut.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.920
But now I'm back.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.800
Now that I am back...

21:37.240 --> 21:39.200
you'll want me back.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.160
(LAUGHS)

21:43.320 --> 21:45.280
You'll want me back.

Is that in the script?

22:10.040 --> 22:12.080
Sorry. (LAUGHS)
