00:12.200 --> 00:14.407
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.504 --> 00:18.376
Alan Milliken is dead.
All signs point to a heart attack.

00:18.504 --> 00:22.728
- What happened, Sherry?
- I went to the house to speak to Julia.

00:22.823 --> 00:26.025
There was an argument,
and he had a heart attack.

00:26.121 --> 00:28.231
Julia, I need for you to
tell me exactly what happened.

00:28.329 --> 00:31.051
- I tried to give him his medication.
- What do you mean you tried?

00:31.144 --> 00:32.713
Sherry stopped me.

00:32.808 --> 00:36.010
We believe Michael Amador
is in possession of the Cordilla virus.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.474
He is either headed to
Los Angeles or is here already.

00:38.568 --> 00:40.521
Our only lead is Nina Myers.

00:40.651 --> 00:43.945
She thinks Amador is meeting with a man
by the name of Marcus Alvers.

00:44.072 --> 00:46.186
- What about Nina?
- She's out of the picture.

00:46.282 --> 00:49.641
I hope so.
She can point to both of us.

00:49.770 --> 00:52.937
Just wanna give you an update on Nina.
Richards is working on her now.

00:53.034 --> 00:55.402
- " I think that's a mistake."
- Why?

00:55.530 --> 00:59.048
I don't think anybody should be in there
that hasn't worked with her before.

00:59.145 --> 01:00.969
All Richards does is inflict pain.

01:01.067 --> 01:02.955
There's no way for her
to manipulate him.

01:03.050 --> 01:05.098
Nina, I don't think
you've met Darren Richards.

01:05.227 --> 01:09.098
- "How much more of this"
you wanna endure, Nina?
- I think this is about it.

01:10.825 --> 01:13.739
She hit an artery!

01:13.865 --> 01:16.490
- Michelle, call Medical!
- "She's bleeding too much!"
We gotta take her there now!

01:16.585 --> 01:18.443
- Nina tried to commit suicide.
- Where is she now?

01:18.540 --> 01:21.066
She's in the clinic being operated on.

01:21.162 --> 01:22.826
Damn it!

01:22.921 --> 01:25.707
Drop the gun.
Put your hands on your head.

01:25.804 --> 01:28.170
- You won't kill me.
- Nina, damn it!

01:30.573 --> 01:33.387
You don't have any more
useful information, do you, Nina?

01:33.482 --> 01:36.780
- I do.
- No, you don't.

01:41.740 --> 01:45.707
The following takes place
between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m.

01:50.253 --> 01:53.035
Tony, what happened?

01:53.132 --> 01:55.980
- Nina Myers is dead.
- How?

01:56.076 --> 01:59.787
Jack shot her. Chappelle's on his way
to talk to him right now.

02:00.843 --> 02:03.627
Was it... justified?

02:03.725 --> 02:08.043
Jack wouldn't risk this operation
just to get vengeance.

02:08.172 --> 02:10.285
Are you sure about that?

02:18.283 --> 02:21.260
- " Okay. All right."
- This is the gun I used.

02:21.389 --> 02:23.628
- Send it over to ballistics for a match.
- "Yes, sir."

02:23.725 --> 02:25.933
Secure this area
till Forensics gets here.

02:26.029 --> 02:28.525
And pull the surveillance
footage off of there.

02:28.652 --> 02:31.310
- Jack, can I have a word?
- Just give me a minute.

02:31.404 --> 02:33.678
- "No, Jack. Now."
- Look, it's okay. It's all right. Go.

02:33.773 --> 02:37.871
I'll be right back.

02:37.965 --> 02:40.847
- What the hell happened here?
- Nina tried to escape.

02:40.975 --> 02:43.341
Yeah, I know she tried to
escape. How did she get shot?

02:43.469 --> 02:45.998
She pulled her gun.
I pulled mine in self-defense.

02:46.094 --> 02:47.695
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

02:47.791 --> 02:50.637
Nina was our best chance
at locating this virus.

02:50.733 --> 02:53.678
She was a material witness
in an ongoing investigation.

02:53.805 --> 02:56.238
I know exactly
what she was, Ryan.

02:56.365 --> 03:00.047
Division's gonna want me
to certify this shooting.

03:00.143 --> 03:02.510
Then do it.

03:02.606 --> 03:06.063
- You have to come with me
and look at security playback.
- Fine.

03:07.886 --> 03:10.413
- "Kim, you all right?"
- Yeah, I'm okay.

03:10.510 --> 03:12.655
I got here as soon as I heard.

03:12.752 --> 03:15.598
Sweetheart, I gotta go with Chappelle for
a moment. I'll be back as soon as I can.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.838
- I'll stay with her, Jack.
- It's okay. I'm fine.

03:24.335 --> 03:26.383
She tried to kill me.

03:26.511 --> 03:28.462
It's over now, okay?
Your father stopped her.

03:28.591 --> 03:30.800
Yeah, except I don't know
what happened.

03:30.895 --> 03:34.798
- What do you mean?
- He told me to leave the room, and I heard shots.

03:38.255 --> 03:42.256
Kim, you're safe, okay?
That's all that matters.

03:42.352 --> 03:46.704
I don't know. Ever since she killed my mother,
I've been wanting Nina dead.

03:46.833 --> 03:50.703
And now that she is
it's not gonna bring my mother back.

03:50.831 --> 03:55.088
I just didn't think
I was gonna feel this way.

03:55.217 --> 03:57.297
How do you feel?

03:58.928 --> 04:00.689
I'm not sure.

04:02.064 --> 04:04.688
It's okay.

04:06.257 --> 04:08.081
Come on.

04:28.529 --> 04:30.354
He's here.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.986
We were getting worried.
We have a job to do.

04:48.084 --> 04:50.193
We've got plenty of time.

04:52.371 --> 04:56.627
- I'm curious.
- About what?

04:56.754 --> 04:59.122
Why you chose such a limited target.

04:59.250 --> 05:03.027
Why not the airport or sports arena?

05:03.154 --> 05:05.524
If the objective was to
inflict maximum casualties...

05:05.650 --> 05:09.458
That's not the objective.
Not yet.

05:11.092 --> 05:13.458
Then why are you doing this?

05:14.676 --> 05:16.818
To send a message.

05:28.019 --> 05:30.293
Most of you already know,
but for those of you who don't...

05:30.388 --> 05:33.748
Jack Bauer shot and killed Nina Myers
while she was trying to escape custody.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.500
The order from Division specified
that we use nonlethal force.

05:36.595 --> 05:38.357
- It's over. She's dead.
- How are we gonna find the virus?

05:38.451 --> 05:42.326
- Alvers has it, and Nina was
our only connection to Alvers.
- "Not necessarily."

05:42.452 --> 05:46.036
We were on to Alvers in the first place because
he was Amador's contact in Los Angeles.

05:46.132 --> 05:48.340
A search order for Amador
is still active.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.613
Technically, yeah, but we've pretty much
exhausted all our leads.

05:50.709 --> 05:52.597
Then run 'em again
and widen the parameters.

05:52.691 --> 05:55.893
Cross-reference financial transactions,
travel itineraries, aliases.

05:55.990 --> 05:58.261
- Whatever it takes to find him.
- We're still operating under the assumption that...

05:58.357 --> 06:00.597
- Amador's in Los Angeles with the virus?
- That's right.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.989
And the Russians have just sent us some intel
that supports that assumption.

06:05.846 --> 06:11.061
It's a detonating device. Part of the Soviets'
biowarfare arsenal till late 1980s.

06:11.158 --> 06:14.006
It's used to disperse pathogens
throughout the atmosphere. Three weeks ago...

06:14.133 --> 06:16.821
a dozen of these were stolen
from an armory in the Ukraine.

06:16.917 --> 06:19.285
We also believe that Alvers and Amador
are arming these detonating devices...

06:19.381 --> 06:21.877
with vials full of the virus,
which means we all have to work fast.

06:22.005 --> 06:23.988
So let's get going.

06:28.853 --> 06:32.533
Place the vial here.
To actually arm the device...

06:32.629 --> 06:36.343
flip switches one and two,
then wait 10 seconds...

06:36.440 --> 06:39.190
and flip the third switch
which activates the timer.

06:40.790 --> 06:43.254
When the timer goes off...

06:47.479 --> 06:49.559
What's the dispersal radius?

06:49.654 --> 06:51.222
A hundred meters.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.519
And the dispersal rate increases
geometrically depending on wind and weather.

06:54.613 --> 06:57.942
Better than I thought.

06:58.072 --> 06:59.894
I made some modifications.

07:13.303 --> 07:15.191
So, Michael...

07:17.113 --> 07:19.992
tell me how it went down in Mexico.

07:25.303 --> 07:27.418
You didn't think I would find out?

07:31.416 --> 07:34.455
I didn't think you needed to know...

07:35.961 --> 07:37.849
as long as
you got what you wanted.

07:37.975 --> 07:43.000
You were stupid enough to believe that
Jack Bauer had turned against C.T. "U..."

07:43.096 --> 07:45.850
and now you've got every intelligence
agency in the country after you.

07:45.945 --> 07:49.817
- Bauer's story checked out.
- Don't presume to tell me about Jack Bauer.

07:49.944 --> 07:51.834
What you did in Mexico
was stupid, it was greedy...

07:51.961 --> 07:53.721
and it may have cost me my advantage.

07:53.818 --> 07:57.337
Alvers and I still expect to be paid.

08:04.442 --> 08:08.345
The authorization code is 7QV78.

08:12.088 --> 08:16.474
This is only half.

08:16.602 --> 08:19.065
I'll release the balance after
I've received confirmation on the hotel.

08:19.195 --> 08:20.667
The deal was we get paid in full.

08:20.795 --> 08:23.481
The deal changed
when you went down to Mexico.

08:25.178 --> 08:29.308
Now, after you've hit the hotel,
you'll get the rest of your money.

08:33.176 --> 08:35.001
Fine.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.626
- Adam.
- "I gotta comb through"
these data streams, Chloe...

08:49.723 --> 08:52.444
- so unless this is important...
- I think I have a thread on Amador.

08:52.539 --> 08:54.651
What are you talking about?

08:54.746 --> 08:57.629
The gold certificate account registered
to one of Amador's aliases.

08:57.756 --> 09:00.155
It's a Zurich bank,
but it was activated by a local server.

09:00.282 --> 09:01.948
- When?
- Just a few minutes ago.

09:02.044 --> 09:04.891
Kim, get over here.
I need you to run a back trace.

09:04.987 --> 09:07.451
- What's going on?
- Chloe found a bank in Zurich
that may be talking to Amador.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.851
- Chloe, what's the sequency program?
- Beta-one.

09:11.803 --> 09:14.011
If this turns out to be real, how long
before you tag the location?

09:14.107 --> 09:16.508
Five minutes, 10 tops.

09:18.939 --> 09:22.205
- She was down when you shot her.
- She was going for her gun.

09:22.300 --> 09:25.822
- That's what you keep telling me.
- It's the truth.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.772
You knew where
the security camera was.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.140
You stood in front of it to obscure
any visual record of the shooting.

09:30.235 --> 09:33.788
- She was going for her gun.
- I wish I could believe that, but I don't.

09:36.669 --> 09:39.037
For God's sake, Jack.
There's something called due process.

09:39.164 --> 09:41.789
It's why we've got judges
and juries and laws.

09:41.886 --> 09:46.141
Don't you dare tell me about the law.
Nina Myers killed my wife, and they let her go.

09:46.269 --> 09:50.075
And she would've killed my daughter
if I hadn't gotten there when I did.

09:50.205 --> 09:54.461
Using drugs to maintain your cover is one
thing. I was willing to look the other way.

09:54.557 --> 09:58.270
But I've gotta answer to my bosses about the
questionable shooting death of a key witness.

09:58.367 --> 10:00.380
- "Excuse me, sir?"
- "We're in the middle of something here."

10:00.508 --> 10:02.334
I assume finding the virus
is a priority.

10:02.429 --> 10:05.052
- What do you got?
- We may have Amador.

10:05.148 --> 10:07.872
Chloe flagged a Zurich account registered
to one ofhis aliases.

10:07.966 --> 10:10.814
Someone accessed it locally.
We'll have a point of origin any minute now.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.860
- " Get the field teams ready."
- "Tony's on it."

10:12.990 --> 10:15.357
- Jack, this isn't resolved yet.
- We have a live lead, Ryan.

10:15.486 --> 10:18.269
And what do I tell Division?
That I let you stay on active duty...

10:18.367 --> 10:20.286
while you're still the subject
of an investigation?

10:20.413 --> 10:24.062
- "It's my ass on the line too."
- I've been with Jack all day,
and with all that's happened...

10:24.158 --> 10:26.975
he's still operating at a higher level than
anybody else in the field, including me.

10:27.071 --> 10:28.926
I didn't ask your opinion.

10:29.023 --> 10:31.872
- Well, I'm giving it to you anyway.
- Excuse me?

10:31.967 --> 10:35.486
Sir, if this lead turns out to be real,
we need Jack on-site...

10:35.583 --> 10:37.950
and believe me,
you will want him there.

10:38.079 --> 10:41.024
They'll crucify me if
I let you back out in the field.

10:43.007 --> 10:45.022
Would you give me a minute?

10:50.110 --> 10:54.848
This is your call, Ryan.
I understand the position you're in.

10:54.943 --> 10:58.336
But I give you my word,
I can do my job.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.048
Thank you.

11:21.920 --> 11:25.568
Listen, Julia, I thought I was clear.

11:25.663 --> 11:28.705
- You can't be contacting me today.
- I'm scared, Wayne.

11:28.801 --> 11:32.577
They've already started
to question Beatriz and I'm next.

11:32.674 --> 11:36.226
- I don't know what to say.
- Where's your lawyer?

11:36.323 --> 11:41.730
- He's not here yet.
- Okay, first of all, you're innocent.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.713
Remember that, all right?

11:43.809 --> 11:48.706
I'm not innocent. I let Sherry convince me
not to give Alan his medication.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.682
- I could've saved his life.
- You don't know that.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.625
Wh-What about Sherry?

11:54.721 --> 11:58.018
Has she said anything
to the president?

11:58.148 --> 12:01.474
No. No, and she won't.
She told him it was an accident.

12:01.603 --> 12:05.697
Now whether he believes her
or not is another matter. Now just...

12:07.938 --> 12:09.538
- Wayne?
- Yeah.

12:09.635 --> 12:11.265
Wayne!

12:11.362 --> 12:14.402
Yeah, Bill. The president just walked in,
so I'm gonna have to get back to you.

12:14.497 --> 12:16.930
Oh, God. I'm so scared.

12:17.059 --> 12:21.187
Yeah, yeah, and I understand that.
Just remember what I said, okay?

12:21.284 --> 12:23.970
- Yeah.
- All right.

12:24.068 --> 12:26.275
Well, what did Bill have to say?

12:26.370 --> 12:28.355
Uh, he found out that Alan died.

12:28.485 --> 12:31.747
- Well, that didn't take long.
- Yeah.

12:31.843 --> 12:34.178
He wants us to know that we have
his support on the health care bill.

12:34.274 --> 12:36.035
That's good.

12:38.212 --> 12:40.707
Have you spoken to Julia yet?

12:43.333 --> 12:48.741
- No.
- Maybe you should call her.
Get her side of the story.

12:48.837 --> 12:52.131
David, I think we should stay
as far away from this as possible.

12:52.260 --> 12:55.395
Which means you don't believe Sherry,
that it was an accident?

12:55.491 --> 12:57.380
Look, I don't know what to believe.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.044
All I know is what it will look like.

12:59.172 --> 13:03.141
You call in Sherry to deal with Milliken,
and a few hours later he winds up dead.

13:05.572 --> 13:08.709
Let's go.

13:08.804 --> 13:11.653
Dad, just heard back from Division.
They're gonna have a man on the inside.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.310
His name is Jim Wong.
Here's an update on your strike team.

13:14.404 --> 13:17.445
Thanks. You okay?

13:17.540 --> 13:20.228
Yeah, I'm okay.

13:20.326 --> 13:22.628
- Did Chappelle question you
about shooting Nina?
- "Yeah."

13:22.726 --> 13:25.221
And?

13:25.350 --> 13:28.164
I told him I wasn't sorry that Nina was dead.
I wasn't sorry I shot her.

13:28.260 --> 13:32.327
She posed an immediate threat to you, to me
and to thousands of innocent people.

13:32.421 --> 13:34.244
You had to do it, didn't you?

13:40.453 --> 13:42.341
Yeah.

13:44.518 --> 13:45.830
Come here.

13:50.182 --> 13:52.422
- We gotta go.
- Okay.

14:13.703 --> 14:18.886
- Wayne, what's going on?
- You tell me.

14:18.985 --> 14:20.872
Look, it's late,
and I'm a little too tired...

14:20.999 --> 14:23.367
Sherry, I know about Alan Milliken.

14:25.064 --> 14:27.017
Yes, it's awful.

14:29.256 --> 14:31.943
But I already told David what happened.

14:32.040 --> 14:36.167
Except you left out the part about you preventing
Julia from giving Alan his medication.

14:40.647 --> 14:44.198
You stood there,
and you watched a man die.

14:49.382 --> 14:51.751
You would've done
the same thing had you been there.

14:51.881 --> 14:53.704
I never would've been there
in the first place!

14:53.800 --> 14:56.489
Listen, David asked me to come here
to help clean up your mess.

14:56.585 --> 14:58.409
What did you think
he expected me to do?

14:58.504 --> 15:01.704
What he expected was for you to get Alan
off his back, Sherry, but not like this!

15:01.802 --> 15:05.671
Complex problems sometimes have
the simplest solutions, Wayne.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.649
- Oh, for God's sakes.
- You're upset. That's understandable.

15:08.746 --> 15:12.489
- But what is done is done.
- This is insane, Sherry. You are insane.

15:12.585 --> 15:16.009
We can control the situation, Wayne.
We just need to be on the same page.

15:16.138 --> 15:18.026
Sherry, I'm sorry.
But David's gonna have to handle this.

15:18.122 --> 15:21.097
David can't know about this,
for his own protection.

15:21.226 --> 15:24.137
If he doesn't know anything,
he's got nothing to deny.

15:24.265 --> 15:28.074
- Sherry, we can't cover this thing up.
- We can and we will.

15:28.201 --> 15:31.434
That's why you're talking
to me instead of David.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.025
Because you understand
what has to happen, Wayne.

15:34.153 --> 15:37.610
- Oh, yeah, you've got it all figured out, don't you?
- Wayne.

15:39.561 --> 15:42.283
What did you say to Julia?

15:44.394 --> 15:47.049
Not to talk to anyone
until she spoke to a lawyer.

15:48.107 --> 15:49.993
Good.

15:50.089 --> 15:53.867
Then as long as she keeps
her mouth shut, we'll be fine.

16:07.882 --> 16:09.770
Mrs. Milliken?

16:12.523 --> 16:16.300
I'm Detective Norris.

16:16.427 --> 16:19.211
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

16:20.811 --> 16:23.787
I know this is a, um,
difficult time for you...

16:23.916 --> 16:25.931
but I'd like to ask you a few questions.

16:27.148 --> 16:28.972
Unless that's a problem.

16:29.067 --> 16:32.716
No. No, it's just that my lawyer...

16:32.812 --> 16:35.371
wanted me to wait for him
before I talked to anyone.

16:35.469 --> 16:38.411
Really? Did he say why?

16:38.540 --> 16:40.524
You know lawyers.

16:40.652 --> 16:43.117
Unfortunately, I do.

16:43.244 --> 16:48.078
But these questions don't require counsel.
They're pretty straightforward.

16:48.206 --> 16:50.092
According to the officers...

16:50.187 --> 16:53.454
you told them that you were asleep in bed
when the body was discovered.

16:53.549 --> 16:55.756
Yes.

16:55.853 --> 16:59.275
Alan and I have had
separate bedrooms since the stroke.

16:59.405 --> 17:03.245
And you didn't hear anything
until the housekeeper woke you up?

17:03.373 --> 17:05.483
That's right.

17:06.765 --> 17:08.973
Because, you see,
she says she heard a car...

17:09.069 --> 17:12.364
starting up and leaving the driveway.

17:12.492 --> 17:15.790
- Our driveway?
- That's what woke her up.

17:15.916 --> 17:19.693
She got to the window in time to see
a light-colored car driving away.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.519
She thought it was a Mercedes.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.671
I didn't hear anything,
so I wouldn't know.

17:26.766 --> 17:30.990
Do you have any friends who drive
a light-colored Mercedes?

17:31.086 --> 17:35.502
Detective, half of the people
we know own a Mercedes...

17:35.630 --> 17:38.255
and we know a lot of people.

17:38.350 --> 17:42.639
Are you aware that the security cameras
in your surveillance system are shut down?

17:42.767 --> 17:44.493
According to the time code...

17:44.590 --> 17:48.846
it appears they were shut down about an
hour before your husband's death.

17:48.943 --> 17:52.879
Beatriz is the one who arms the system
before she goes to sleep...

17:53.008 --> 17:55.503
- so maybe you should ask her.
- My partner did.

17:55.630 --> 17:59.438
- She doesn't know anything about it.
- Neither do I.

17:59.567 --> 18:02.958
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

18:03.087 --> 18:06.159
You don't sound very sure.

18:06.254 --> 18:09.551
Detective Norris...

18:09.679 --> 18:13.167
exactly what are you implying here?

18:13.295 --> 18:15.888
My husband was a very sick man.

18:15.985 --> 18:18.416
He died because he was sick.

18:18.544 --> 18:21.521
That's probably true.

18:21.649 --> 18:24.336
But it's beginning to look like he
might've had some help.

18:33.009 --> 18:35.856
I'm sending you revised grid coordinates,
so open a data pipe.

18:35.951 --> 18:39.728
- Tony, how close are you?
- A few minutes.

18:39.824 --> 18:42.033
Whoever accessed Amador's account
did it from somewhere in this grid.

18:42.129 --> 18:44.048
We're guiding the field units as we go.

18:44.177 --> 18:45.872
- Chase, did you get the new coordinates?
- Yeah, I got 'em.

18:45.969 --> 18:48.210
You're too far north. You're gonna have to
adjust toward Broadway.

18:48.306 --> 18:50.033
Okay. Go right on College.

18:53.266 --> 18:56.178
I'm not gonna have an address for another
few minutes. I'll call you when I get it.

18:56.305 --> 18:59.282
All right.

19:01.489 --> 19:03.506
Look, I appreciate what
you said to Chappelle earlier.

19:03.633 --> 19:07.410
- Wouldn't have said it if I didn't mean it.
- Still.

19:07.538 --> 19:11.441
Finding the virus is all that matters
right now. Everything else can wait.

19:17.010 --> 19:19.314
You gonna wait
to tell Kim about your daughter?

19:23.250 --> 19:26.900
- No. We talked about it.
- How'd she take it?

19:26.995 --> 19:29.490
- She's handling it fine.
- "She's handling it fine"?

19:29.618 --> 19:32.946
Look, it's between Kim and me.
If you don't mind, I'd like to keep it that way.

19:33.075 --> 19:35.537
- Yes, I mind. She's my daughter.
- "She's a grown woman, Jack."

19:35.666 --> 19:38.738
We care about each other.

19:45.649 --> 19:48.819
Just stay focused
on what we're gonna do.

20:30.933 --> 20:32.469
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

20:32.597 --> 20:35.668
- How long will it take?
- About 25 minutes.

20:35.764 --> 20:37.654
- Hurry.
- I will.

20:37.751 --> 20:39.956
Look, just get it done so we can get our money.

20:40.052 --> 20:44.180
It's gotta be done right. I don't wanna be in
the body bags they'll be carrying out of here.

21:03.253 --> 21:06.644
- Hello.
- Is this Sherry Palmer?

21:06.773 --> 21:08.342
Yes. Uh, who is this?

21:08.471 --> 21:12.245
Uh, I'm Detective Michael Norris
of the L.A.P.D.

21:12.374 --> 21:14.198
I'm sorry to bother you
this time of night.

21:14.294 --> 21:17.943
Uh, Detective Norris,
how did you get this number?

21:18.040 --> 21:20.502
It was given to me by
a woman named Julia Milliken.

21:20.631 --> 21:24.502
- Do you know her?
- Yes, l-I do.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.064
Were you with her tonight?

21:27.191 --> 21:30.742
Tonight? Uh, no, I wasn't.

21:30.838 --> 21:32.664
Mm. She says you were.

21:32.759 --> 21:35.448
Well, she's lying.
I've been right here all night.

21:35.542 --> 21:40.919
- And where is here?
- In the district offices with
my ex-husband President Palmer.

21:41.047 --> 21:43.609
He asked for my help
on a political matter and l...

21:43.736 --> 21:47.384
I'm sorry, Detective.
Do you mind telling me what this is about?

21:48.760 --> 21:51.446
Mrs. Milliken's husband died
about an hour and a half ago.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.912
Oh, I'm so sorry.

21:54.009 --> 21:58.265
She claims that you and she caused
his death by with holding his medication.

21:58.392 --> 22:03.609
Well, that's preposterous. I haven't seen
Mr. Milliken or his wife in over three years.

22:03.737 --> 22:07.543
And you say that you were with
the president since... what time?

22:07.672 --> 22:11.930
Since about 10:00.
That's over five hours ago.

22:12.057 --> 22:16.664
And if we were to contact President Palmer,
he'd be able to confirm that?

22:16.760 --> 22:18.746
I'm sure he will.

22:18.873 --> 22:23.480
Thank you, Mrs. Palmer.
We'll be in touch.

22:32.954 --> 22:36.249
- Wayne.
- Outbreak scenarios from
the National Health Services.

22:37.914 --> 22:39.929
Nothing like a little light reading.

22:40.056 --> 22:42.585
They're sending over a liaison to answer
any questions you may have.

22:42.714 --> 22:46.106
No doubt I'll have many.

22:48.121 --> 22:52.409
- Anything else?
- No.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.074
Wayne.

22:56.120 --> 23:00.380
I'm your brother. I think I know when
there's something on your mind.

23:02.330 --> 23:04.250
No, I just wanna make sure
you're okay.

23:04.378 --> 23:09.306
I'll let you know
when this is all over.

23:12.732 --> 23:15.674
- David.
- Yeah?

23:15.804 --> 23:18.650
The reason I joined your administration
was because I thought I'd be an asset.

23:18.747 --> 23:22.906
The last thing I ever wanted
was to be a thorn in your side.

23:23.004 --> 23:24.987
Wayne, you are an asset.

23:25.116 --> 23:27.548
Well, there's a lot of smart people
out there that you could've hired.

23:27.676 --> 23:30.587
But none that I trust as much as you.

23:35.515 --> 23:38.654
- Wayne Palmer.
- Wayne, it's Tony.

23:38.748 --> 23:41.115
- We have a lead on the virus.
Jack's on his way with a team.
- All right.

23:41.211 --> 23:44.413
- I'll have someone update you when...
- I want you to stay on the line.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.524
I wanna be apprised of everything
that happens as it happens.

23:46.651 --> 23:51.227
C.T.U. May have located the virus.
Jack Bauer's leading the operation.

24:05.149 --> 24:07.644
- What about this area?
- Lieutenant Wong's heading that way now.

24:09.627 --> 24:12.733
- Jack.
- Hey, Bill. This is my partner, Chase Edmunds.

24:12.829 --> 24:15.101
- Have you got a man on the inside?
- Yeah.

24:15.197 --> 24:17.087
He's been through
about half the rooms in the club.

24:17.182 --> 24:18.974
- Have you seen Alvers or Amador?
- Not yet.

24:19.069 --> 24:22.526
Captain, north room is clear.

24:22.654 --> 24:24.860
Moving down the main corridor.

24:43.646 --> 24:46.140
I count 15 people.

24:46.270 --> 24:48.158
I'm still not seeing either target.

24:48.255 --> 24:50.974
Copy. There are three rooms
adjacent to the hall.

24:51.070 --> 24:55.392
- "They may be offices."
- I'm checking it now.

25:01.886 --> 25:06.462
Captain, I got an armed man outside
the door of the southern-most room.

25:07.711 --> 25:09.216
" Don't move."

25:20.032 --> 25:23.232
- He was looking in your room.
- Lieutenant.

25:25.151 --> 25:27.296
- Lieutenant Wong.
- Get your men in there now.

25:27.392 --> 25:30.015
Team 'A, "move on target.
Team "B,"maintain perimeter.

25:42.562 --> 25:44.096
Get out of here.

25:52.095 --> 25:55.872
- All right! Get down on the floor!
- You're not going anywhere.

25:55.999 --> 25:58.177
- " Okay!"
- " Get in there. Let me see your hands."

26:07.970 --> 26:11.009
Target's been neutralized.
Repeat.' Target's been neutralized.

26:11.107 --> 26:13.633
- "All units sweep the building."
- Where's the virus, you son of a bitch?

26:13.762 --> 26:17.024
- You're too late, Jack.
- "Chase!"

26:18.593 --> 26:21.089
Take him into one of the other rooms.
We've got some work to do.

26:21.217 --> 26:23.681
I don't wanna be disturbed
by the SWAT guys.

26:43.747 --> 26:45.507
Set him down there.

26:48.739 --> 26:52.994
You betrayed me, Jack.
You were with C.T.U. All along.

26:53.122 --> 26:56.898
That's right, Amador. You betrayed me too.
I'm just better at it than you.

26:57.027 --> 26:58.915
Yeah, well, it won't matter
in the long run.

26:59.043 --> 27:00.867
You have no idea what you're up against.

27:00.963 --> 27:05.092
- Why don't you tell me?
- He knows who you are, Jack.

27:06.883 --> 27:11.076
What are you talking about?
Who knows who I am?

27:11.171 --> 27:15.556
"Don't presume to tell me
about Jack Bauer." That's what he said.

27:15.683 --> 27:17.603
You go up against him,
you're a dead man.

27:19.426 --> 27:21.699
All I wanna know right now
is where the virus is.

27:21.796 --> 27:25.828
I don't know. I've passed it off.

27:25.924 --> 27:29.828
Look, you can do what you want to me.
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

27:32.131 --> 27:34.117
What are you afraid of?

27:34.245 --> 27:37.189
Who are you afraid of?

27:42.853 --> 27:44.549
We can protect you.

27:44.645 --> 27:48.837
- Can you, Jack?
- "Yes."

27:48.933 --> 27:51.299
- And my family?
- Yes.

27:51.396 --> 27:54.180
You couldn't even protect your own.

27:58.789 --> 28:00.997
I'm gonna ask you just one last time.

28:03.974 --> 28:07.749
Where is the virus?

28:07.877 --> 28:10.662
- Go to hell.
- Chase!

28:13.573 --> 28:15.398
No!

28:15.494 --> 28:17.669
Where's the virus?

28:25.733 --> 28:29.510
When he comes to, you do it again.

28:35.205 --> 28:38.471
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, I'm transferring you to Tony right now.

28:38.567 --> 28:41.511
I'll take it over here.

28:41.638 --> 28:44.648
Jack, I'll put you on speaker.
Ryan's with me.

28:44.775 --> 28:47.398
- We've got Amador.
- What about the virus?

28:47.494 --> 28:49.383
No. We were late.
He'd already passed it on.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.750
- Passed it on to who?
- We haven't been able to find out yet.

28:51.846 --> 28:55.143
Amador's terrified, and he doesn't scare
easily. He did tell me one thing though.

28:55.240 --> 28:58.312
Whoever's behind this
apparently knows me very well.

28:58.408 --> 29:00.200
That's not much to go on even if it's true.

29:00.295 --> 29:02.439
I understand that,
but we also just can't ignore it.

29:02.537 --> 29:05.640
I want you to cross-check everybody that
I've worked with over the last five years...

29:05.735 --> 29:08.648
on both sides of the law...
see what names we come up with.

29:08.776 --> 29:11.240
- We'll check it against
what we know about the virus.
- All right. We're on it.

29:11.368 --> 29:13.256
- "Agent Bauer."
- Yeah?

29:15.242 --> 29:18.472
We found an incubator.
There's no contamination...

29:18.568 --> 29:21.864
but we're gonna isolate it,
run a few tests, then send it back to N.H.S.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.808
We also found some prints, a few hairs. We're
sending them back to your lab for a workup.

29:24.904 --> 29:27.304
- Okay. Good work.
- Jack, what's going on?

29:27.431 --> 29:29.256
They found the incubator.
There's no leakage.

29:29.352 --> 29:31.720
They're gonna run some tests
here and then send it over to N.H.S.

29:31.816 --> 29:34.313
All the other evidence is coming back to our lab.
We're gonna do the workup.

29:34.441 --> 29:35.465
- " Agent Bauer."
- Yeah?

29:35.593 --> 29:39.049
- "We found Amador's laptop."
- Tony, hold on.

29:39.177 --> 29:43.114
- Most of the files are heavily encrypted.
- Can you read any of it?

29:43.241 --> 29:45.672
- Chandler Plaza Hotel on Wilshire.
- "What about it?"

29:45.801 --> 29:47.946
His hard drive has the full
architectural schematic.

29:48.041 --> 29:50.250
Structural, plumbing, electrical.

29:50.346 --> 29:54.794
- When's the last time this file was accessed?
- Five hours ago.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.775
Tony, I think we've got
a high-probability target.

29:56.872 --> 29:59.659
- What is it?
- "The Chandler Plaza Hotel"
on Wilshire Boulevard.

29:59.754 --> 30:02.635
Adam, get me head of security at Chandler Plaza
Hotel. Jack, should we evacuate?

30:02.761 --> 30:04.779
No. We don't even know
if the virus has been released.

30:04.906 --> 30:08.682
Evacuating the hotel could only accelerate
an outbreak. We need to contain the building.

30:08.809 --> 30:11.018
We need to do it without starting a panic.

30:11.114 --> 30:13.129
I'll set up a soft
perimeter, no police presence.

30:13.258 --> 30:15.433
We'll send a team from here,
run the operation on-site.

30:15.529 --> 30:18.442
Tony, no one... and I mean no one... goes
in or out of that building, you understand?

30:18.570 --> 30:20.107
- Copy that.
- Good.

30:20.234 --> 30:22.250
- Dennis.
- Yeah?

30:22.379 --> 30:25.226
I need you to call N.H.S., have them send
teams to the hotel as soon as possible.

30:25.354 --> 30:28.139
- Most importantly, they have to operate under
the radar, all right?
- "Tony."

30:28.236 --> 30:32.011
I have the head of security
for the Chandler Plaza Hotel, Craig Phillips.

30:32.138 --> 30:35.786
- Mr. Phillips, this is Tony Almeida, head of C.T.U.
- How can I help you?

30:35.881 --> 30:37.644
There's been a threat against your hotel.

30:37.739 --> 30:40.169
As of this moment, it is very important
you not allow anybody in or out...

30:40.299 --> 30:43.019
- of the structure, you understand?
- I understand.

30:43.116 --> 30:45.418
What's the nature of the threat?

30:45.515 --> 30:47.882
The release of an infectious substance
inside the hotel.

30:49.483 --> 30:51.627
You're saying that the substance has
already been released?

30:51.723 --> 30:56.265
- It's possible. We don't know for sure.
- Do we know who's responsible?

30:56.363 --> 30:59.275
You're probably looking for
a man named Marcus Alvers.

30:59.402 --> 31:01.612
His description's being sent to you as we speak.

31:01.707 --> 31:03.724
I want your people to do a search of the hotel.

31:03.852 --> 31:06.316
Does that mean that Alvers
is already inside the hotel?

31:06.444 --> 31:10.478
- We have to assume that's the case, yes.
- I'll start a search.

31:10.572 --> 31:13.644
I'm bringing a C.T.U. Team.
We'll call you as soon as we arrive.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.565
- Right.
- Thanks.

31:20.717 --> 31:23.086
What the hell is this?

31:24.716 --> 31:27.148
Ryan assigned me to head the team
that's going to the hotel.

31:27.276 --> 31:29.710
- Ryan, this is...
- I don't wanna hear it.

31:29.837 --> 31:34.284
As the head of C.T.U., you have an obligation
to stay at the center of information.

31:34.412 --> 31:38.031
Michelle has more hours of disaster-control
simulation than anyone else on staff.

31:38.126 --> 31:41.326
Not to mention her practical experience
from the D.C. Anthrax outbreak.

31:41.422 --> 31:45.676
Michelle will lead the team,
Gael will second.

31:45.774 --> 31:47.981
You'll be in constant communication,
pass on any guidance you can...

31:48.077 --> 31:50.095
based on intel that comes in.

31:54.479 --> 31:57.838
- They're waiting for me.
- Michelle.

31:59.918 --> 32:05.167
I don't care what Ryan says. I can get somebody
from Division to take your place.

32:05.295 --> 32:08.751
No. He's right.
I should be the one to go.

32:11.055 --> 32:14.895
All right. Then you let me know the second
you get your people set. All right?

32:34.512 --> 32:39.215
And did you hear
any strange noises?

32:42.096 --> 32:45.168
We're a couple minutes away from
the hotel. Where's N.H. S?

32:45.265 --> 32:48.241
They're getting ready.
They should be there in a while.

32:48.369 --> 32:50.927
A while? What does that mean?
Two minutes, 10 minutes?

32:51.053 --> 32:54.449
- Probably closer to 20.
- We don't have that kind of time, Tony.

32:54.577 --> 32:56.784
I understand, but you wait
until they get there, all right?

32:56.879 --> 32:59.566
I don't want anybody
going inside that hotel without biosuits.

32:59.663 --> 33:03.506
We can't wait too long, Tony. I mean,
if we have to go in and stop the virus...

33:03.632 --> 33:06.289
Michelle, you wait, all right?
That's an order.

33:06.384 --> 33:10.287
Fine. Anything else?

33:11.889 --> 33:13.904
No.

33:17.712 --> 33:21.648
- What's wrong?
- Just stuff between Tony and me.

33:21.778 --> 33:23.600
Sorry.

33:25.105 --> 33:28.818
Things haven't been right
since he got back from the hospital.

33:30.609 --> 33:34.865
The last couple of months, Tony and I
have been working pretty closely together...

33:34.993 --> 33:37.681
planning this operation.

33:37.778 --> 33:41.232
It's been eating away at him that he wasn't
able to talk to you about it.

33:44.755 --> 33:47.601
I just want this day to end.

33:49.618 --> 33:52.305
I will call them so
they know not to come in.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.483
- Did you lock the garden doors?
- " Yes, sir."

33:54.612 --> 33:56.146
Good.

34:07.986 --> 34:12.210
Mr. Phillips, C. T.U. Has just arrived.
They're outside the front door.

34:12.306 --> 34:14.770
Good. A maintenance man just walked through
here. I don't remember seeing him before.

34:14.899 --> 34:17.202
- Turnover's pretty high in engineering.
- Check it out anyway.

34:17.299 --> 34:19.827
- He was here not 10 seconds ago.
- Yeah. Sure thing.

34:23.061 --> 34:27.250
- This is Phillips.
- Mr. Phillips, this is Agent Michelle Dessler
from C.T.U.

34:27.348 --> 34:30.161
Have you circulated
the Marcus Alvers photo yet?

34:30.257 --> 34:33.908
Yes, uh, so far nobody's seen him. We're
halfway through the common areas of the hotel.

34:34.004 --> 34:37.780
- After that, I need you to start on the guest rooms.
- Okay, that's gonna take time...

34:37.876 --> 34:39.411
unless you can lend us some manpower.

34:39.540 --> 34:41.938
We'll be coming in as soon
as the HazMat suits arrive.

34:43.476 --> 34:46.228
My people don't have any HazMat suits.

34:48.373 --> 34:51.219
I know that, Mr. Phillips.
We'll bring some when we come in.

34:56.565 --> 34:58.389
Yeah.

35:00.213 --> 35:02.228
Michelle.

35:02.355 --> 35:05.749
- I pulled this off the security camera.
- "Alvers."

35:05.877 --> 35:08.021
- How long ago was this?
- About half an hour ago.

35:08.116 --> 35:10.998
- Has he come back out?
- Not as far as I can tell.

35:11.124 --> 35:14.997
- Half an hour.
- He may have already released the virus.

35:15.126 --> 35:18.774
But if he hasn't,
we may be able to stop him.

35:23.607 --> 35:26.549
I can't order anyone in
because it's against protocol.

35:26.677 --> 35:30.613
But Alvers is in there, and we might
still have a chance to stop him.

35:44.215 --> 35:46.421
Did you find that maintenance man?

35:46.519 --> 35:49.590
No. But Penzo says he just saw someone he
didn't recognize heading toward the utility room.

35:49.687 --> 35:52.661
He's gonna check it out.

36:02.485 --> 36:04.023
Mr. Phillips, where can we set up?

36:04.152 --> 36:06.520
You can use this area,
and this area over here.

36:07.830 --> 36:09.657
I thought you were gonna
wait for those HazMat suits.

36:09.752 --> 36:12.119
They'll let us know
as soon as they get here.

36:12.312 --> 36:16.505
This guy you're looking for, we might have
an idea where he is. Let me take you there.

36:16.598 --> 36:18.840
Why don't you tell me, and I'll check it out.

38:14.330 --> 38:16.637
Put your hands in the air!
I'm a federal agent!

38:16.731 --> 38:20.028
- Lady! Lady, take it easy!
- Slowly!

38:20.157 --> 38:22.970
Move over to where I can see you.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.987
I'm a maintenance man, for God's sake!

38:26.331 --> 38:28.765
I adjusted a thermostat in the laundry room.

38:33.052 --> 38:34.781
Stop right there!

38:38.108 --> 38:40.476
Put your hands on your head!

38:43.260 --> 38:45.470
Put your hands on your head!

38:47.548 --> 38:50.397
Wrap your right arm around the pipe.

38:52.989 --> 38:55.196
Now cuff yourself.

38:58.397 --> 39:01.311
Where's the virus?

39:03.068 --> 39:07.070
If this virus gets out, you die
just like everyone else.

39:11.293 --> 39:14.943
It's in the central ventilation unit.

39:19.039 --> 39:22.047
- Gael, can you hear me?
- "I hear you."

39:22.173 --> 39:24.989
- The virus is in the central ventilation unit.
- On my way.

40:04.607 --> 40:06.847
Found it. It's in a vial.

40:06.944 --> 40:09.759
Stay clear, Gael.
N.H.S. Should be here any minute.

40:09.855 --> 40:11.551
I'll send down a HazMat suit.

40:11.647 --> 40:15.904
There may not be enough time for that, Michelle.
The vial's inside a detonating device.

40:16.000 --> 40:20.159
The timer's armed.
I've got to get to it, try to disarm it.
