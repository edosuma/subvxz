I'd like to report an act of
public indecency on Truro Road.

00:55.105 --> 00:56.065
Hello?

00:57.345 --> 00:58.625
You've found Ash's car?

01:11.505 --> 01:13.305
Dad.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.945
- Oh!
- Give me back my phone!

01:19.065 --> 01:20.265
You're welcome!

01:21.345 --> 01:23.745
- Finally!
- Why do we have to meet so early?

01:23.825 --> 01:25.945
Because you didn't answer
your phone at all last night.

01:26.025 --> 01:28.585
Look, we've got a problem.
Will's gone, okay?

01:28.665 --> 01:30.225
He doesn't want the money.

01:30.305 --> 01:31.825
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes.

01:31.905 --> 01:34.865
I can't get this D-lock off
and I don't want to have my bike stolen.

01:34.945 --> 01:36.865
By who? There's no one around.

01:39.305 --> 01:41.225
You never know
who's going to be lurking, do you?

01:41.745 --> 01:44.025
So, Will didn't want the money?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.545
No. Reckons he can get more.

01:45.625 --> 01:48.065
Says he's gonna tell everyone everything
and fuck me over.

01:48.545 --> 01:49.905
All right. Well, I mean...

01:50.345 --> 01:52.385
It's good he didn't want the money.

01:52.465 --> 01:53.785
We have to leave the country.

01:53.865 --> 01:55.185
What?

01:55.265 --> 01:56.345
For how long?

01:56.425 --> 01:59.225
For good. We're looking at spending
the rest of our lives in prison.

01:59.905 --> 02:01.985
Oh, Hanging Gardens of Babylon!

02:02.065 --> 02:04.225
- Keep it down!
- I'm sorry.

02:05.585 --> 02:08.985
Things were just
getting back on track at work and...

02:10.185 --> 02:11.665
Annette and I, we were...

02:12.225 --> 02:14.585
we were going to start trying
in the bedroom again.

02:15.065 --> 02:16.065
Sex.

02:16.825 --> 02:18.625
But now I have to abandon her.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.025
Look, I don't wanna leave either.

02:22.785 --> 02:24.225
I was about to dump Becca.

02:24.305 --> 02:25.985
I was finally getting on with my parents.

02:26.385 --> 02:27.665
And Linda asked me out for a drink.

02:29.945 --> 02:31.025
And now...

02:32.185 --> 02:34.865
- we have to leave ASAP.
- Yes.

02:35.945 --> 02:38.385
I'm all packed. You should do the same.

02:38.465 --> 02:39.945
And we need all of that drug money.

02:42.505 --> 02:43.785
Where do you think we'll go?

02:44.345 --> 02:45.585
I don't know.

02:46.945 --> 02:48.265
Spain?

02:48.865 --> 02:51.025
Perhaps we can pretend
that we're father and son.

02:51.585 --> 02:53.345
And your beautiful red-headed mother,

02:53.425 --> 02:56.785
she died in a tragic fishing accident
when you were seven.

02:56.865 --> 02:59.025
At first the local authorities
pointed the finger at me...

02:59.105 --> 03:01.865
Look, shall we just...? Let's just meet
at Paddington, two hours, yeah?

03:01.945 --> 03:03.945
- Yeah.
- Is that enough time?

03:04.025 --> 03:05.345
Enough time?

03:05.425 --> 03:06.745
Ha! On this thing?

03:07.905 --> 03:09.825
You bet your bottom dollar, kiddo.

03:10.625 --> 03:11.865
See you in a minute.

03:13.425 --> 03:14.545
Ah!

03:18.465 --> 03:20.065
Last time I saw you was when we...

03:21.105 --> 03:22.225
You know, the...

03:23.505 --> 03:24.865
When you got hit by that car.

03:26.345 --> 03:28.105
Oh, pardon me.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.905
What the fuck was Will going on about?
He said you fell out a window.

03:43.225 --> 03:46.505
- Fucking hell!
- Where did that come from?

04:03.745 --> 04:06.945
Morning, Miss West.
Thank you so much for calling me.

04:07.025 --> 04:10.065
<i>No problem.
I was hoping to talk to Daniel today,</i>

04:10.145 --> 04:12.665
<i>but he didn't show up.
I want him for the launch.</i>

04:12.745 --> 04:13.865
The launch?

04:13.945 --> 04:15.465
<i>The Live A Great Life campaign.</i>

04:15.545 --> 04:17.625
<i>Linda's found a fun run coming up,
so let's piggy-back on that.</i>

04:17.704 --> 04:20.545
- <i>Give the runners free bracelets.</i>
- Right...

04:20.625 --> 04:21.945
I must've missed that meeting.

04:22.024 --> 04:23.545
I thought Daniel would be there with you.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.505
<i>No, he's not. Linda's the only one
from We Cover to show up.</i>

04:27.465 --> 04:29.825
<i>Oh, hi, Michael.
It's such a beautiful day.</i>

04:29.905 --> 04:33.065
I mean, I'm the only one
that's come in today.

04:33.145 --> 04:36.985
I gave everyone the day off so that they
could attend your father's funeral. Look.

04:37.065 --> 04:38.545
<i>Michael, everyone hated him.</i>

04:39.825 --> 04:41.265
<i>Oh, don't worry. Michael.</i>

04:41.345 --> 04:44.105
<i>I'm sure you'll have lots of staff members</i>
<i>at</i> your <i>funeral.</i>

04:44.185 --> 04:45.385
Thank you, Linda.

04:46.065 --> 04:47.425
Well, can I say, Miss West,

04:47.505 --> 04:50.305
that it actually breaks my heart
that I can't be there today.

04:50.385 --> 04:52.465
<i>I'm sure, but his will specifically states</i>

04:52.545 --> 04:55.185
<i>that you were not to attend the funeral
if it was on a workday.</i>

04:55.265 --> 04:56.425
- <i>Oh, God.</i>
- Oh.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.425
<i>- It's happening.
- Earth to earth...</i>

04:58.505 --> 05:00.905
<i>- Michael, I gotta go.
- ...ashes to ashes...</i>

05:05.705 --> 05:07.185
Goodbye, Mr. West.

05:08.905 --> 05:10.745
Sorry I couldn't be there
in person, but...

05:12.345 --> 05:13.545
know I'm here,

05:14.705 --> 05:16.025
steadying your ship.

05:35.625 --> 05:36.865
Passport, check.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.425
Drug money, check.

05:42.105 --> 05:43.665
Caught you red-handed!

05:45.545 --> 05:47.465
Well, what have you got
to say for yourself?

05:48.705 --> 05:51.385
I can explain. I was forced into it.

05:51.465 --> 05:54.145
I didn't mean to do anybody any harm.

05:54.225 --> 05:55.425
I know you didn't, Iain,

05:55.505 --> 05:58.945
but St Frederick's has
a strict no bicycles policy.

06:01.265 --> 06:05.345
Yes. Yes, of course it does.
I'll take it outside immediately.

06:05.425 --> 06:07.505
I know that there are bicycle thieves
everywhere,

06:07.585 --> 06:09.025
but it's about impression, isn't it?

06:09.625 --> 06:12.985
Especially as I'm putting your name
forward to become...

06:13.745 --> 06:14.745
a partner.

06:15.705 --> 06:16.865
A partner?

06:18.145 --> 06:20.545
- Here at St Frederick's?
- You've really impressed me of late.

06:20.625 --> 06:23.945
Complete 180. And that should
be reflected in your position here.

06:25.345 --> 06:26.425
Wow!

06:27.345 --> 06:30.065
Ah, Sherry, I...
I don't know what to say.

06:30.145 --> 06:31.545
Well, that's evident.

06:31.985 --> 06:34.265
Now, get that bike moved, would you?

06:34.345 --> 06:35.865
It can't be kept indoors.

06:36.705 --> 06:38.465
Not even by partners, eh?

06:38.985 --> 06:40.345
Yes.

06:41.385 --> 06:42.705
Yes, partners.

06:48.865 --> 06:49.865
DAD

07:00.025 --> 07:01.105
MICHAEL

07:10.145 --> 07:11.465
PREGNANT

07:11.905 --> 07:13.105
Morning, Dr. Glennis.

07:17.985 --> 07:20.705
YOUR FATHER IS AT THE OFFICE.
I THINK HE MAY BE DRUNK.

07:21.505 --> 07:22.505
Fuck's sake!

07:22.585 --> 07:23.825
Fucking mess!

07:29.025 --> 07:30.225
Um...

07:30.545 --> 07:32.825
Annette, I didn't realize.

07:32.905 --> 07:34.745
I was tricked. Um...

07:35.705 --> 07:38.265
Tell her the truth, Iain. Stop lying.

07:38.345 --> 07:40.025
Is drug dealing a crime?

07:40.105 --> 07:41.505
Then I'm guilty.

07:41.745 --> 07:44.945
Annette, I did it for you,
so you could have a better life.

07:46.345 --> 07:48.065
So <i>we</i> could have a better life.

07:49.025 --> 07:50.465
Join that country club.

07:54.705 --> 07:55.905
Hello!

08:05.425 --> 08:07.385
Who is it?

08:07.465 --> 08:10.545
It's Vanessa.
Your work said you called in sick.

08:11.185 --> 08:12.385
Er...

08:13.585 --> 08:14.945
Er...

08:15.425 --> 08:16.425
Yeah.

08:17.185 --> 08:18.585
I've got food poisoning.

08:19.385 --> 08:21.145
Sorry. Um, Look,

08:21.225 --> 08:23.705
would... would you just please
be honest with me?

08:24.985 --> 08:26.105
Were you...

08:27.385 --> 08:28.825
Were you sleeping with Ash?

08:29.945 --> 08:32.745
- What?
- They found his car a few roads from here.

08:32.825 --> 08:35.225
Well, he was probably
coming over to see Daniel.

08:35.304 --> 08:38.784
Daniel wasn't here. He was on the news
from his office that day, remember?

08:38.865 --> 08:40.465
And it's not just that.

08:40.985 --> 08:43.065
- Ash's phone.
- Well, what about his phone?

08:44.145 --> 08:45.145
I unlocked it

08:45.705 --> 08:47.145
and I saw a message...

08:56.665 --> 08:57.905
For fuck's sake!

09:00.665 --> 09:02.665
Son, I'm sorry.

09:03.505 --> 09:06.545
I don't know what to do.
I... I've made a terrible mess.

09:06.625 --> 09:07.905
What's happened?

09:07.985 --> 09:11.785
Well, as far as I can gather,
your father has decided to...

09:11.865 --> 09:12.985
to leave your mother.

09:13.065 --> 09:14.545
- What?
- I had to.

09:14.625 --> 09:18.625
- We weren't meant to be together.
- I'm so sorry, son.

09:18.705 --> 09:20.305
Why are you doing this?

09:21.865 --> 09:23.705
You've got to live life, Daniel.

09:24.465 --> 09:25.505
Grab it by the balls.

09:26.945 --> 09:28.945
- You taught me that.
- No, I didn't.

09:29.025 --> 09:31.145
- I've never said that.
- With your cancer.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.105
It just showed me
how little time we have here.

09:34.505 --> 09:36.305
And your bravery...

09:36.385 --> 09:38.825
You inspired me. Like Douglas Bader.

09:39.145 --> 09:41.145
MUM: HAVE YOU HEARD FROM YOUR DAD?

09:41.505 --> 09:42.585
You haven't told Mum yet.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.505
She thinks I'm at
the Steam Museum in Brentford.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.985
Oh, that's a great family day out.

09:47.785 --> 09:49.265
Look, have you been drinking, Dad?

09:49.345 --> 09:52.425
- Oh, some whisky, a couple of Pernods.
- Oh, God.

09:52.505 --> 09:54.225
- I'm so sorry.
- And you drove here?

09:54.945 --> 09:56.625
I hate for you to see me like this,

09:57.345 --> 09:59.065
especially with you having cancer.

10:01.225 --> 10:03.705
Mr. Glass, speaking as somebody

10:03.785 --> 10:05.665
who's recently been evicted by his wife,

10:05.745 --> 10:09.025
can I say I think
you need to fight for your marriage.

10:10.425 --> 10:12.585
Yeah. Yeah, he's right.

10:12.665 --> 10:14.585
Look, I'm gonna drive you
back home to Mum.

10:14.665 --> 10:17.105
It's not too late to fix this.
You are not leaving her.

10:17.185 --> 10:19.385
You're not driving my car.
Not after what happened last time.

10:19.465 --> 10:20.825
Just calm down.

10:20.905 --> 10:24.425
I'm gonna get you a glass of water.
Michael, can you look after him?

10:26.985 --> 10:28.905
Daniel, it's Dr. Iain Glennis.

10:28.985 --> 10:30.865
I was cycling to the station
by my house when...

10:30.945 --> 10:34.785
Yeah, okay. I'm gonna be
a little bit late. I had to come to work.

10:35.305 --> 10:37.465
- I've seen your friend.
- Who? Will?

10:37.865 --> 10:39.865
Yes, he's in a You-Ber.

10:39.945 --> 10:41.665
A You-Ber? What's a You-Ber?

10:41.745 --> 10:45.065
A You-Ber.
One of the internet taxi things.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.385
Oh, an Uber.

10:46.465 --> 10:49.265
- Okay, where's he going now?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

10:49.345 --> 10:53.625
I've lost him. We are quite close
to the We Cover offices.

10:56.665 --> 10:57.665
He just walked in.

10:57.745 --> 11:00.025
Yes. I'm on my way.

11:01.185 --> 11:02.185
His face...

11:07.025 --> 11:08.665
- It's fine.
- <i>Good!</i>

11:09.505 --> 11:12.305
You know, your dad was always trying
to get me to come here for meetings.

11:12.385 --> 11:13.705
Huh! I'll bet.

11:14.105 --> 11:16.865
- So you're selling it?
- Yes, I'm selling everything.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.625
His property, his erotic art,

11:19.705 --> 11:20.785
the company...

11:20.865 --> 11:23.345
- What will you do with the money?
- I'm expanding the sanctuary.

11:23.425 --> 11:25.385
I really wanna take in
more orphan gorillas.

11:25.465 --> 11:26.625
And I'm adding a pool.

11:26.705 --> 11:28.345
Oh, do gorillas like swimming?

11:29.265 --> 11:30.305
No.

11:30.385 --> 11:31.585
But I do.

11:36.265 --> 11:40.505
Oh, wow! Mr. West met Nelson Mandela?

11:40.585 --> 11:43.385
Yeah, he didn't realize he campaigned
vigorously for his imprisonment.

11:45.625 --> 11:46.945
That's funny.

11:47.025 --> 11:48.745
Can you come to the garage?

11:53.265 --> 11:54.425
Wowee!

11:55.105 --> 11:57.505
Yeah, it's a shame
he didn't die 15 years ago

11:57.585 --> 11:59.665
while his porn collection
was still worth something.

11:59.745 --> 12:01.065
I'm auctioning everything.

12:01.145 --> 12:03.865
- Well, I can help you list it all.
- Really?

12:03.945 --> 12:07.105
Yeah, I'd love to. I love looking through
other people's junk.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.225
Thank you. That would be fantastic.

12:09.745 --> 12:12.225
- Okay, well, I'll see you in a bit.
- Yeah. I'm on it.

12:15.225 --> 12:16.305
Thank you, Linda.

12:17.065 --> 12:18.185
You're an angel.

12:18.265 --> 12:19.905
Aww!

12:25.585 --> 12:28.385
Okay, I'll see you soon.
Good luck in here.

12:29.225 --> 12:30.785
Can you believe my dad
had leather sheets?

12:30.865 --> 12:32.745
I mean, it's just disgusting.

12:32.825 --> 12:34.665
Wash your hands
before you come in the house.

12:36.785 --> 12:38.745
What are you doing here?
Where's your mask?

12:38.825 --> 12:40.145
Which office is Katerina West's?

12:40.225 --> 12:43.425
Accent? You're not even American.
Who the fuck are you?

12:43.505 --> 12:44.785
You lied to me.

12:45.225 --> 12:47.305
Wow! Unbelievable.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.825
- No, don't go in there.
- Where is she?

12:49.905 --> 12:51.945
- Sorry, who are you?
- Katerina West. Where is she?

12:52.025 --> 12:54.825
I am not at liberty
to divulge that information.

12:54.905 --> 12:57.825
She may be at Brentford Steam Museum.

12:57.905 --> 12:59.705
Well, no, she's at the funeral.

13:00.825 --> 13:03.465
Oh, yes. Dear Daddy's funeral.

13:03.545 --> 13:06.545
Please, can we just sit down
and just talk about this?

13:06.625 --> 13:09.385
I'm done talking with you,
back-stabber. Fuck you.

13:09.465 --> 13:11.585
Do not swear at my son.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.905
If only you knew what a lying
piece of shit your son really is.

13:14.985 --> 13:16.985
You can't trust anything
that comes out of his mouth.

13:17.065 --> 13:18.785
And to think
I thought we'd be best friends.

13:19.785 --> 13:22.105
- Wanker!
- How dare you!

13:22.785 --> 13:24.065
- Dad!
- Ow!

13:24.145 --> 13:25.945
- Oh, sorry!
- Michael, are you all right?

13:26.025 --> 13:28.465
I'm fine, I'm fine.
It was an honest mistake.

13:28.945 --> 13:30.545
It's your word against mine!

13:30.625 --> 13:34.745
Actually, Daniel, it's your word
against you!

13:36.545 --> 13:37.825
Dad, I need your car keys now.

13:37.905 --> 13:39.305
Keys? Keys, er...

13:40.065 --> 13:41.345
They've gone.

13:42.105 --> 13:43.745
That bastard must've stolen them.

13:43.825 --> 13:45.065
For fuck's sake!

13:50.225 --> 13:53.105
WILL GOING TO STEAL TOYOTA RAV4
WITH CHRISTIAN FISH. STOP HIM!

13:54.185 --> 13:55.985
But it could be anywhere!

13:57.985 --> 13:59.545
Oh!

14:00.065 --> 14:01.425
Bless you, Lord.

14:11.305 --> 14:13.865
Cutting someone's brakes... Right. Um...

14:14.585 --> 14:16.185
One, two, three, four...

14:16.265 --> 14:18.625
You'd think they'd make it easier
to cut someone's brakes!

14:21.705 --> 14:23.065
Oh!

14:26.385 --> 14:27.265
Ah!

14:27.345 --> 14:28.705
Oh, please...

14:34.945 --> 14:35.945
Oh, Lord in heaven,

14:36.025 --> 14:37.265
hallowed be...

14:37.665 --> 14:38.865
hallowed be...

14:47.305 --> 14:49.065
Oh, thank you, Lord.

14:51.585 --> 14:52.745
Where are we going?

14:52.825 --> 14:54.305
We're getting your car keys back.

14:54.385 --> 14:57.105
Keys? Oh, well, but they're here.

14:57.185 --> 14:59.385
What? Oh, for fuck's sake!

14:59.825 --> 15:02.225
- They were in my trousers. Silly me!
- Oh, God!

15:04.705 --> 15:07.185
- 0770900...
- <i>What's going on?</i>

15:08.665 --> 15:09.825
I'm back on his tail.

15:11.385 --> 15:13.065
Are you okay?

15:14.225 --> 15:16.025
No, I'm really sick.

15:18.825 --> 15:20.505
- Oh.
- Please forgive the smell.

15:22.465 --> 15:26.625
So, um... you said something
about a message.

15:26.705 --> 15:29.945
Yes. I saw a message
from you to Ash and I think...

15:31.065 --> 15:32.305
I saw the word "cock."

15:33.945 --> 15:35.265
Oh! Um...

15:36.465 --> 15:37.785
I remember.

15:37.865 --> 15:41.025
It was... it was before...
I knew Daniel had cancer

15:41.105 --> 15:42.265
and I was dumping him,

15:42.345 --> 15:44.985
so I texted Ash for some advice and...

15:45.065 --> 15:47.465
and I called Daniel a cock.

15:49.705 --> 15:51.025
Of course!

15:51.945 --> 15:54.945
I'm so sorry. I'm just
all over the place right now. I...

15:55.025 --> 15:56.425
You don't need to apologize.

15:57.425 --> 15:58.945
So, where's the phone now?

15:59.025 --> 16:01.545
Oh, well, I got so excited
that I'd unlocked it

16:01.625 --> 16:03.025
that I dropped it down the toilet.

16:03.105 --> 16:05.145
Oh, my God, Vanessa!

16:05.225 --> 16:07.985
The internet says I've got to leave it
in rice for three days to dry it out

16:08.065 --> 16:09.785
and even then it might be fucked.

16:10.945 --> 16:14.065
Right. Well... let's hope it's not.

16:15.665 --> 16:17.065
Oh, God, there's more.

16:19.665 --> 16:21.945
- Drive carefully, son.
- I will!

16:22.025 --> 16:24.225
I've driven a lot since then, okay?

16:24.305 --> 16:26.505
No crashes. We'll be fine.

16:27.625 --> 16:29.985
Oh! Hello?

16:30.745 --> 16:32.425
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Right on his tail.

16:32.505 --> 16:34.265
He didn't steal the Rav.

16:34.345 --> 16:35.865
He took another You-Ber.

16:35.945 --> 16:38.585
I know. He's headed to
Kenny West's house.

16:38.665 --> 16:42.785
Number 57 Goldhanger Road,
just off the A307.

16:42.865 --> 16:44.825
Right, I'll get there before him.

16:44.905 --> 16:48.105
All the smoothies and exercise
are certainly paying off.

16:48.185 --> 16:49.745
I'm barely breaking a sweat.

16:49.825 --> 16:51.385
Okay, what are you gonna do?

16:51.465 --> 16:52.665
I'm going to stop him.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.225
Er, yeah, but how?

16:54.305 --> 16:58.065
Well, if I can cut a man's brakes,
I'm pretty sure I can bash his brains in.

16:58.505 --> 17:00.385
Sorry, what did you... what did you do?

17:00.465 --> 17:04.065
When you said he'd stolen the keys
to the Rav 4 with the Christian fish,

17:04.145 --> 17:06.545
I got to it before he did.
I snipped the brakes.

17:08.464 --> 17:09.625
You cut the brakes?

17:09.704 --> 17:11.545
Yes, yes. I cut the brakes.

17:12.025 --> 17:13.545
I'm not proud of it, Daniel,

17:13.625 --> 17:15.464
- but it was him or us.
- Fuck!

17:15.545 --> 17:17.305
<i>I know it's a high-pressure environment,</i>

17:17.385 --> 17:18.505
<i>but please don't use that word.</i>

17:20.305 --> 17:22.425
- No, no, Daniel, slow down.
- Fuck!

17:22.505 --> 17:24.625
Can you not use that word, Daniel?

17:24.704 --> 17:27.385
Daniel, what the hell are you doing?
Slow down!

17:27.464 --> 17:28.985
You fucking idiot!

17:35.425 --> 17:36.585
Daniel?

17:37.145 --> 17:38.385
Daniel?

17:38.785 --> 17:40.025
Hello?

17:41.705 --> 17:43.505
If he talks to me like that again,

17:44.665 --> 17:46.185
I'll cut <i>his</i> bloody brakes!

18:11.345 --> 18:13.025
- Hello.
- What the fuck?

18:13.105 --> 18:15.145
- Hey, chill out, chill out!
- Chill out? Who the fuck are you?

18:15.225 --> 18:17.465
The gate was open, the door was open...

18:19.185 --> 18:20.705
You're Kenny's daughter, right?

18:20.785 --> 18:22.025
Are you from We Cover?

18:22.625 --> 18:23.825
In a way.

18:24.345 --> 18:26.225
There's something I need to tell you.

18:31.305 --> 18:33.385
I know Kenny's house
is around here somewhere.

18:33.785 --> 18:36.825
Now, did he say Goldacre Lane
or Goldacre Road?

18:38.145 --> 18:40.865
Goldacre Lane's 137 miles away.
So it must be...

18:41.425 --> 18:42.665
here, I suspect.

18:50.305 --> 18:51.385
Argh!

19:05.385 --> 19:07.345
Daniel doesn't have cancer.

19:07.425 --> 19:09.865
That's insane!
Who pretends to have cancer?

19:09.945 --> 19:11.225
Daniel.

19:11.305 --> 19:13.985
The poster boy
for your daddy's company is a fake.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.745
Right. Anything else you wanna tell me?

19:15.825 --> 19:17.225
9/11 was an inside job?

19:17.305 --> 19:20.025
Donald Trump won the popular vote?
I mean, come on.

19:20.945 --> 19:22.345
I have evidence.

19:25.185 --> 19:27.985
<i>It's only for six months, okay?</i>

19:28.065 --> 19:30.225
<i>And then everyone
will think I've beat it.</i>

19:30.305 --> 19:32.345
<i>And then I'll get my life back on track</i>

19:32.425 --> 19:34.625
<i>and no one will ever know</i>

19:34.705 --> 19:36.465
<i>I faked cancer.</i>

19:37.585 --> 19:41.185
When Daniel began to confide in me,
I started recording our conversations.

19:43.305 --> 19:44.305
What do you want?

19:45.945 --> 19:47.625
- Money.
- I don't have any!

19:47.705 --> 19:51.345
Oh, fuck off! Look at this place.
You'll get millions for it.

19:51.425 --> 19:52.985
Uh-uh. All that money is going to charity.

19:53.065 --> 19:54.225
Oh, yeah.

19:54.305 --> 19:57.345
Yeah, Little Miss Trust Fund's
monkey hotel.

19:57.425 --> 19:59.585
Look, I'm not greedy, okay?

19:59.665 --> 20:02.145
I just want 100 grand
and then I'll be out of your hair.

20:02.225 --> 20:03.945
Right, and how do I know
you're gonna stop at that?

20:04.825 --> 20:05.945
Well, you don't.

20:06.025 --> 20:08.505
But if people find out
that Daniel's been faking it,

20:08.585 --> 20:10.385
then We Cover will be finished.

20:10.465 --> 20:11.825
And you...

20:11.905 --> 20:13.905
you can't afford to take that chance.

20:17.585 --> 20:19.825
No. I can't do that to my gorillas.

20:19.905 --> 20:21.465
Fuck your gorillas!

20:23.345 --> 20:25.705
It is what it is. It is what it is...

20:30.825 --> 20:31.785
Okay.

20:35.905 --> 20:37.705
So, for 100 grand...

20:38.185 --> 20:39.345
you'll disappear?

20:42.385 --> 20:44.985
Off the face of the earth.

20:46.745 --> 20:48.185
Motherfucker!

21:03.905 --> 21:04.985
Oh, God.

21:05.505 --> 21:06.825
Not again.

21:09.225 --> 21:10.505
It is what it is...

21:16.345 --> 21:17.905
I know you're the size of a lentil,

21:18.625 --> 21:20.865
but try and kick once if you're Daniel's

21:20.945 --> 21:22.745
or twice if you're Ash's.

21:28.745 --> 21:29.745
Hi, Mrs. Glass.

21:29.825 --> 21:32.905
Becca, they've had an accident!

21:33.425 --> 21:34.625
They? Who?

21:34.705 --> 21:35.865
Daniel and Gordon.

21:36.265 --> 21:39.185
I knew he shouldn't have got in the car
with him. He's cursed.

21:39.265 --> 21:40.505
Wait, what?

21:40.985 --> 21:43.385
My Gordon, my Simon...

21:43.905 --> 21:44.945
You mean Daniel?

21:45.025 --> 21:46.545
Daniel.
