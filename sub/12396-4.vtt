- [gaSPSJ
OH, CARLTON.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.337
WHAT A GREAT
HOUSEWARMING GIFI'.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.132
WE COULD REALLY
USE THESE, UM...

00:15.180 --> 00:18.479
STEAK KNIVES?

00:18.510 --> 00:20.148
- THOSE ARE NINJA KUNAI
THROWING BLADES.

00:20.180 --> 00:21.716
FOR USE IN CASE
OF A HOME INVASION.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.388
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD ALSO
USE THEM TO CARVE ANIMAL FLESH,

00:23.420 --> 00:26.412
ESPECIALLY IF SAID ANIMAL
IS INVADING YOUR HOME.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.088
- AH-HA. [chuckles]
- MM.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.121
- WHAT'S THIS? OH.
- OH!

00:31.160 --> 00:34.129
GIANT CLOWN GLOVES. FINALLY,
A HOUSEWARMING GIFI' WE CAN USE.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.094
- SHAWN,
THESE ARE OVEN MI'ITS.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.062
THANK YOU, MOM,
THANK YOU, LLOYD.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.761
- YOU'RE SO WELCOME,
SWEETIE.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.631
- WELL,
I-I BELIEVE A PERSON

00:40.670 --> 00:42.558
CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
WHEN BAKING.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.134
WHICH REMINDS ME

00:44.170 --> 00:45.808
OF A VERY INTERESTING STORY
ABOUT A CLIENT OF MINE.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.070
AND HE OWNED
A DOUGHNUT SHOP,

00:48.110 --> 00:50.271
I BELIEVE,
THAT WAS IN RECEIVERSHIP.

00:50.310 --> 00:52.244
AN D--
- LLOYD.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.748
- I'M SORRY,
IT'S NOT THE TIME

00:54.780 --> 00:56.384
FOR ONE OF MY
ACCOUNTING ANECDOTES.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.285
- [chuckles]
HONESTLY, SWEETIE, IT NEVER IS.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.187
BESIDES, I DIDN'T
MARRY YOU FOR YOUR JOKES.

01:01.220 --> 01:05.088
I MARRIED YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE
HONEST, AND DEPENDABLE,

01:05.130 --> 01:06.859
AND NOT TO MENTION
INCREDIBLY SEXY.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.652
- OH.
[chuckles]

01:08.700 --> 01:11.123
WELL, I THINK THAT'S IT
FOR THE GIFI'S, EVERYBODY.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.867
HELP YOURSELVES TO
AN AUTHENTIC MEXICAN BUFFET,

01:14.900 --> 01:16.800
COMPLIMENTS
OF MY DEAR FATHER,

01:16.840 --> 01:18.239
AND THE LADIES
FROM OLE MOLE!

01:18.270 --> 01:19.874
- THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

01:19.910 --> 01:24.449
- [sighs]

01:24.480 --> 01:26.573
FAN OF BAJA, CALIFORNIA,
HUH, LLOYD?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.838
- OH, UH, YES, WELL, UM,

01:28.880 --> 01:30.643
I'M A BIT
OF A GEOGRAPHY NUT.

01:30.690 --> 01:35.650
WITH THIS NEW PHONE, I CAN DIAL
UP MAPS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

01:35.690 --> 01:39.148
UH, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO SEE SWEDISH LAPLAND?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.350
- BOY, WOULD I?
- JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.322
SEE IF I CAN...

01:43.370 --> 01:44.769
GET IT.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.563
- GO AHEAD, I DARE YOU.
NOTHING GETS PAST ME.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.363
UH!

01:48.400 --> 01:51.506
- DON'T WORRY.
I'LL GO AND FIX US A PLATE.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.599
YOU KNOW, BABE, YOU'RE A MUCH
BETTER TENNIS PLAYER THAN ME.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.800
- TRUE.

01:54.840 --> 01:55.909
[sighs]

01:55.940 --> 01:58.408
[chuckles]

01:58.450 --> 02:00.475
IT'S AMAZING HOW FAST
OUR LIVES CHANGE, HUH?

02:00.520 --> 02:03.489
YOU MOVED IN WITH JULES,
I FOUND THE WOMAN OF MY DREAMS.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.159
- WHO NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU
SHE HAD A SEVEN YEAR OLD.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.748
I GO'I'I'A GIVE IT TO YOU,
BUDDY.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.826
YOU SURE ARE ACTING CALM,
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

02:09.860 --> 02:12.249
- THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M NOT ACTING, SHAWN.

02:12.300 --> 02:15.349
I'M COOL WITH IT.
I'M A FAMILY MAN NOW.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.198
- GUS, DON'T BE THE REMAKE
OF YOURS, MINE, AND OURS.

02:18.230 --> 02:20.198
FOR THAT MA'I'I'ER,
DON'T BE THE ORIGINAL EITHER.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.663
IT'S OKAY TO ADMIT THAT YOU'RE
FREAKING OUT ON THE INSIDE.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.302
- [chuckles]
MAYBE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:24.340 --> 02:26.501
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY CHILDREN YET.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.735
DON'T WORRY, BUDDY.
IT'LL HAPPEN FOR YOU SOMEDAY.

02:28.780 --> 02:32.568
THEY GROW UP SO FAST,
DON'T THEY?

02:32.620 --> 02:35.612
- YOU MET HIM A WEEK AGO.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.345
- I'LL TELL YOU, JULIA,

02:37.390 --> 02:38.914
I REALLY EXPECTED YOUR STEPDAD
TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.611
I THOUGHT LLOYD WOULD BE
A LITTLE MORE LIKE--

02:40.660 --> 02:42.252
- AWESOME? LIKE FRANK.

02:42.290 --> 02:43.518
- FRANK WAS A LOWLIFE CON MAN.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.858
NO OFFENSE, SWEETIE.

02:45.890 --> 02:46.754
- NONE TAKEN.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.529
- I THINK HE WAS TALKING TO ME.
- RIGHT.

02:48.560 --> 02:50.596
- I'M GONNA GO
CHECK ON LLOYD.

02:50.630 --> 02:51.824
SEE WHERE THOSE DRINKS ARE.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.792
- YOU KNOW, JULES,
FIRST OF ALL,

02:53.840 --> 02:55.762
THERE IS NO LONGER A "YOU."
IT'S JUST "US."

02:55.800 --> 02:57.609
WE LIVE AS ONE NOW.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.779
MATTER OF FACT, WE SHOULD START
THINKING OF A SINGULAR NAME

02:59.810 --> 03:00.902
THAT COVERS BOTH OF US.

03:00.940 --> 03:03.807
JULI-HAWN, SHAWN-IET,

03:03.850 --> 03:05.977
THERE'S ALSO SHULES,
IF YOU'RE A FAN OF BREVITY.

03:06.010 --> 03:07.511
- YEAH,
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

03:07.550 --> 03:08.949
- WHEN MARYANNE AND I
FIRST MET,

03:08.980 --> 03:11.540
I WAS COUNSELING HER
IN HER ACCOUNTING,

03:11.590 --> 03:15.811
AND I FOUND
OH, SO MANY DISCREPANCIES.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.987
BUT THE ONE THING
THAT I SAID TO MARYANNE...

03:18.030 --> 03:19.554
- YOU GOT TO ADMIT
IT'D BE FUN

03:19.600 --> 03:20.794
IF THE TWO OF THEM
BECAME FRIENDS, THOUGH.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.525
COME ON, MY DAD
COULD USE A NEW BUDDY.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.720
- LOOK, IF A FRIENDSHIP
EVOLVES, GREAT,

03:24.770 --> 03:26.965
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD
STAY OUT OF IT,

03:27.000 --> 03:28.763
AND LET IT HAPPEN
NATURALLY.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.336
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
- YEAH.

03:30.370 --> 03:32.873
- [chuckles]

03:32.910 --> 03:36.346
[sighs]

03:36.380 --> 03:39.008
[clears throat]

03:39.050 --> 03:42.781
HELLO, THIS, UH--
THIS IS LUTHER'S, RIGHT?

03:42.820 --> 03:45.687
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
A LUNCH RESERVATION FOR TWO.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.608
MY FATHER, AND SOON-TO-BE
NEW BEST FRIEND.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.753
- WAIT--

03:49.790 --> 03:51.326
- SORRY, MAN, I'M NOT A FAN
OF NATURE, ALL RIGHT?

03:51.360 --> 03:52.918
IT'S SLOW, IT'S OVERRATED.

03:56.030 --> 03:57.429
[phone rings, beeps]
- HELLO.

03:57.470 --> 03:59.392
- HEY, HENRY, IT'S LLOYD.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.590
LISTEN, I'M GONNA BE A LITTLE
LATE TO THE RESTAURANT.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.403
I HAVE TO PICK UP A PACKAGE

04:03.440 --> 04:05.738
AT A MAILBOX PLACE
OVER ON PRESIDIO.

04:05.770 --> 04:07.408
- OH, I KNOW THAT PLACE.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.907
IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER
FROM WHERE I LIVE.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.601
WHY DON'T I JUST PICK IT UP
ON THE WAY OVER?

04:10.650 --> 04:12.277
- OH, NO, I COULDN'T
ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.514
- HEY, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

04:13.550 --> 04:14.847
- YOU SURE?
- NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.484
- YOU PROMISE?

04:16.520 --> 04:18.340
- LLOYD, I COULD'VE
ALREADY GOTTEN IT BY NOW.

04:18.390 --> 04:21.518
- OKAY, THE NUMBER IS 227.
IT'S EASIER IF YOU JUST

04:21.560 --> 04:24.279
GIVE 'EM THE NUMBER,
AND NOT MY NAME, ALL RIGHT?

04:24.330 --> 04:25.888
2-2-7.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.818
- GOT IT.
- YOU WANT TO WRITE THAT DOWN?

04:27.860 --> 04:29.669
- LLOYD, I SAID I GOT IT.
I'M NOT SENILE, YOU KNOW.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.065
- NO, I ONLY SAY THAT

04:31.100 --> 04:33.637
BECAUSE I SOMETIMES
HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING THINGS.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.592
IT'S 227. DID I SAY THAT?

04:35.640 --> 04:37.767
- LLOYD, I'M HANGING UP NOW.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.506
- OKAY, DID I SAY 227?

04:40.540 --> 04:41.973
HELLO?

04:47.020 --> 04:50.478
- HI, THERE.
I NEED TO PICK UP A PACKAGE.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.487
- BOX NUMBER?

04:51.520 --> 04:53.909
- 2-2...

04:53.960 --> 04:56.952
WHAT IS THAT THIRD NUMBER?
SIX?

04:56.990 --> 04:58.855
- YOU'RE ASKING ME?

04:58.890 --> 05:00.994
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FORGOT THE DAMN NUMBER.

05:01.030 --> 05:02.998
MAYBE I AM GOING SENILE.

05:03.030 --> 05:07.990
ANYWAY,
IT'S UNDER "LLOYD FRENCH."

05:08.040 --> 05:10.907
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.536
- YOU FORGOT THE NUMBER,
DIDN'T YOU?

06:48.570 --> 06:50.606
- YOU'RE SERIOUSLY GONNA
BLAME ME FOR WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

06:50.640 --> 06:52.870
- DON'T WORRY,
THEY WON'T COME AFTER US.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.935
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- THIS IS THEIR CAR.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.971
- ALL RIGHT, LLOYD,

06:57.010 --> 06:58.739
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

06:58.780 --> 07:00.509
- WELL,
AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT,

07:00.550 --> 07:02.609
THOSE MEXICAN GENTLEMEN
WANT WHAT'S IN THIS PACKAGE.

07:02.650 --> 07:04.186
- NO CRAP. WHAT'S IN THERE?
WHAT IS IT, DRUGS?

07:04.220 --> 07:06.780
- [laughs]
OH, NO, NO.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.549
THE CONTENTS
ARE NOTHING ILLEGAL.

07:08.590 --> 07:10.023
NO, YOU HAVE
MY WORD ON THAT.

07:10.060 --> 07:11.186
- WELL, YOUR WORD
MEANS DIDDLEY-SQUAT

07:11.230 --> 07:12.822
TO ME RIGHT NOW, LLOYD.

07:12.860 --> 07:14.020
I'LL BET YOU'RE
NOT EVEN AN ACCOUNTANT.

07:14.060 --> 07:15.857
- I MOST CERTAINLY AM.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.697
IN FACT, IF YOU EVER
NEED YOUR TAXES DONE...

07:17.730 --> 07:18.924
IN FACT, I HAVE A--

07:18.970 --> 07:21.530
- HANDS ON THE WHEEL, LLOYD!
[tires squeal]

07:21.570 --> 07:24.801
ALL RIGHT, LLOYD.
WHAT'S GOING ON, REALLY?

07:24.840 --> 07:27.070
- I'M DELIVERING THIS PACKAGE
TO AN OLD FRIEND

07:27.110 --> 07:29.647
IN EXCHANGE
FOR FORGIVENESS

07:29.680 --> 07:31.807
OF A SOMEWHAT SIZEABLE
GAMBLING DEBT.

07:31.850 --> 07:33.169
- HOW SIZEABLE?

07:33.220 --> 07:35.814
- OH, SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
$1 MILLION AND $10 MILLION.

07:35.850 --> 07:36.919
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

07:36.950 --> 07:38.815
- LASSITER.
GOTTA REPORT ALL THIS.

07:38.850 --> 07:42.013
- COULD YOU DO ME A BIG FAVOR
AND HOLD OFF ON THAT?

07:42.060 --> 07:43.186
I'M ASKING YOU AS A FRIEND.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.629
- FRIENDS DON'T
LIE TO FRIENDS

07:44.660 --> 07:45.957
AND THEN GET THEM
SHOT AT, LLOYD.

07:45.990 --> 07:47.628
YOU KNOW,
I JUST HAD MAJOR SURGERY.

07:47.660 --> 07:48.991
I'M SURE THIS IS NOT
GOOD FOR MY HEALING PROCESS.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.895
- YEAH, CAN YOU--EXCUSE ME.
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

07:50.930 --> 07:52.693
- THAT WAS WRONG OF ME.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.196
- GIMME ONE GOOD REASON I
SHOULDN'T PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.004
- GLASS JAW, WINNING SMILE.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.975
PLEASE DON'T.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.868
ALL RIGHT.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.842
HEAR ME OUT.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.619
THEN WE CAN GO TO THE COPS,
I PROMISE.

08:11.650 --> 08:12.617
- YOU GOT ONE MINUTE.

08:12.660 --> 08:13.888
- THIS IS MY LAST DEBT.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.615
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS DELIVER THIS PACKAGE,

08:15.660 --> 08:17.059
AND MY SLATE IS CLEAN.

08:17.090 --> 08:18.580
- AND YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE

08:18.630 --> 08:19.756
WHAT'S IN THIS BOX
IS NOT ILLEGAL.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.529
- I SWEAR ON JULIET'S LIFE.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.028
MARYANNE, JULIET, THE BOYS.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.799
THEY ALL THINK THAT
I'M THIS BORING ACCOUNTANT.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.037
FINDING OUT I'M JUST ANOTHER
FRANK IS GONNA KILL THEM.

08:28.070 --> 08:31.528
PLEASE.

08:31.570 --> 08:34.004
- AND AFTERWARD, WE DRIVE
STRAIGHT TO THE POLICE STATION.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.803
- ABSOLUTELY.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.899
I WAS THINKING A PINKBERRY
ON THE WAY BACK--

08:37.950 --> 08:39.918
- LLOYD, DON'T PUSH IT.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.681
- I SMEL|__ CUMIN.
[sniffs]

08:43.720 --> 08:46.041
I SPECIFICALLY
ASKED FOR NO CUMIN.

08:46.090 --> 08:49.582
- MM, WHAT SMELLS SO GOOD?
IT SMELLS LIKE CUMIN.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.029
- HELP YOURSELF.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.755
- SWEET.
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE, MAN?

08:52.800 --> 08:54.688
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SPENDING
THE DAY WITH RACHEL AND MAXIMUS.

08:54.730 --> 08:56.925
- OH, I'M ON A BREAK WHILE
SHE TAKES HIM TO THE EYE DOCTOR.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.790
- [chuckles]
GOTTA GIVE HIM CREDIT, MAN.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.331
THE WAY YOU'RE
HANDLING THIS WHOLE THING,

09:00.370 --> 09:02.759
IF IT WAS ME, I'D BE
FREAKING OUT THAT SHE HAS A KID.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.859
- [laughs]
I'M THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

09:05.910 --> 09:07.901
IN FACT, I WISH RACHEL
HAD MORE KIDS.

09:07.940 --> 09:10.204
I WISH WE WERE
THE BLACK VON TRAPPS.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.275
- O'HARA, WE JUST GOT A CALL.
- WHAT IS IT?

09:12.310 --> 09:14.346
- SHOTS FIRED OUTSIDE
A MAILBOX PLACE ON PRESIDIO.

09:14.380 --> 09:16.041
- I KNOW THAT PLACE.
IT'S NEAR MY DAD'S.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.786
- REALLY?

09:17.820 --> 09:19.811
WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING--
THE WITNESS DESCRIBED

09:19.860 --> 09:21.259
A MIDDLE-AGED BALD GUY
IN A COSTCO HAWAIIAN SHIRT

09:21.290 --> 09:24.088
FLEEING THE SCENE,
GETTING INTO A CADILLAC SUV

09:24.130 --> 09:25.085
BEING DRIVEN BY ANOTHER
MIDDLE-AGED BALD GUY

09:25.130 --> 09:26.825
IN A YELLOW TIE.

09:26.860 --> 09:28.225
- YOU SET UP A LUNCH
FOR THEM, DIDN'T YOU?

09:28.260 --> 09:29.659
I THOUGHT WE AGREED TO LET
THINGS HAPPEN NATURALLY.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.928
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

09:30.970 --> 09:32.938
WHY IS EVERYONE
SO HIGH ON NATURE?

09:32.970 --> 09:34.938
AND WHAT'S THE HARM
IN THE TWO OF THEM SITTING DOWN

09:34.970 --> 09:36.631
TO A NICE GENTLEMEN'S LUNCH?

09:36.670 --> 09:38.160
- BECAUSE LLOYD
IS A FORMER GAMBLING ADDICT,

09:38.210 --> 09:39.768
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S UP TO HIS OLD TRICKS.

09:39.810 --> 09:41.107
- WAIT A MINUTE.

09:41.140 --> 09:43.005
"ONE CAN NEVER BE
TOO CAREFUL WHILE BAKING" LLOYD?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.142
- YES, I DID
A BACKGROUND CHECK ON HIM

09:44.180 --> 09:46.000
WHEN HE STARTED
DATING MY MOM.

09:46.050 --> 09:47.642
HE'D BEEN CLEAN,
SO I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL HER.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.272
- IS IT WEIRD THAT I LIKE LLOYD
A LITTLE BIT MORE NOW?

09:49.320 --> 09:51.618
- [groans]
- THAT IS WEIRD.

09:51.650 --> 09:53.015
- PUT AN APB ON THE CADDY.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.118
I'M HEADING OVER
TO THE MAILBOX PLACE NOW.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.855
- I AM COMING WITH YOU.

09:55.890 --> 09:58.188
- [sighs]
DUDE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.857
- OH, NO, IT'S COOL.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.151
- SERIOUSLY, YOU SHOULD
GO BE WITH YOUR FAMILY.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.122
- UGH,
I'M SUFFOCATING, SHAWN.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.922
LAST WEEK I WAS MY OWN MAN.

10:04.970 --> 10:07.131
NOW, EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND,
THERE THEY ARE.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.058
I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE BLACK VON TRAPPS,

10:09.100 --> 10:11.136
I WANT TO BE I AM LEGEND,
THAT'S THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER.

10:11.170 --> 10:12.979
- YOU WANT TO BE
THE ONLY MAN LEFT

10:13.010 --> 10:14.034
IN A POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.069
- JUST TAKE ME WITH YOU.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.940
- GO, HENRY.

10:22.990 --> 10:26.312
- LLOYD,
WHAT'RE WE DOING HERE?

10:26.350 --> 10:27.317
WHERE IS YOUR FRIEND?

10:27.360 --> 10:28.884
- CLOSE BY.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.650
- WHOA, WHOA, HEY, LLOYD.

10:31.690 --> 10:33.726
LLOYD, YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT TAKING AN AIRPLANE.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.920
- FAIRLY CERTAIN I DID.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.121
- NO, YOU SAID "ONE STOP."
- YES, EXACTLY.

10:37.170 --> 10:40.435
WE GET IN THE PLANE,
AND THEN WE MAKE ONE STOP.

10:40.470 --> 10:42.062
- THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.330
- OKAY, FINE.
AGREE TO DISAGREE.

10:44.370 --> 10:46.258
- YOU LIED TO ME.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.130
- MY FRIEND LIVES
JUST A SHORT WAY FROM HERE.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.841
WE'LL GET BACK
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

10:49.880 --> 10:50.972
- OUT OF THE PLANE, LLOYD.

10:51.010 --> 10:52.944
- WE REALLY SHOULD BE GOING.

10:52.980 --> 10:54.345
- WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

10:54.380 --> 10:57.144
- HENRY,
WE'RE PRACTICALLY FAMILY.

10:57.190 --> 11:00.057
AND NEED I REMIND YOU,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A COP ANYMORE.

11:00.090 --> 11:02.411
[engine hums]

11:02.460 --> 11:04.348
LET'S GO, HENRY!

11:04.390 --> 11:07.791
[gunshots]

11:07.830 --> 11:09.889
- WHOA! LLOYD! LLOYD!

11:09.930 --> 11:13.263
WAIT! WAIT!
[grunting and groaning]

11:13.300 --> 11:15.063
-_ DAMN IT!
[tires squeal]

11:20.440 --> 11:22.101
- IT'S JUST ABOUT FOUR POUNDS.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.745
MAYBE 3, 3.7.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:24.780 --> 11:26.771
- DETECTIVE LASSITER, SBPD.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.276
I'M GONNA NEED THE TAPES FROM
YOUR STORE'S SECURITY CAMERAS.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.015
PRONTO.

11:30.050 --> 11:31.483
LET'S GO, SQUIRREL-FACE.
TAPES. CRIME IS MONEY.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.011
[cell phone rings]
LASSITER.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.914
- [sighs]
LLOYD IS STILL NOT PICKING UP.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.088
- YEAH, I'M JUST GETTING
MY DAD'S VOICEMAIL AGAIN.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.018
- [sighs]
ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING

11:41.060 --> 11:43.767
TO HELP US FIGURE OUT
WHO MIGHT BE SHOOTING AT THEM?

11:43.800 --> 11:45.427
- UHHMM...

11:45.470 --> 11:47.893
UNFORTUNATELY,
INDIAN FOOD IMPAIRS MY GIFT.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.966
ESPECIALLY CURRIED CRAB.
I'M CRAB BLOCKED.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.205
HEY, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

11:53.240 --> 11:54.434
ABOUT LLOYD'S
SHADY PAST EARLIER?

11:54.480 --> 11:56.072
- I WAS EMBARRASSED
FOR MY MOM.

11:56.110 --> 11:58.044
HE HAS THE WORST TRACK RECORD
WHEN CHOOSING MEN,

11:58.080 --> 11:59.377
AND NOT JUST
LLOYD AND MY DAD.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.844
FIRST, THERE WAS
JOE THE EMBEZZLER.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.017
THEN AL
THE DRUNKEN PICKPOCKET.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.189
AND THEN STEVE, WHO SOLD
DEFECTIVE ABOVE-GROUND POOLS.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.312
- ABOVE-GROUND POOLS?
- YEAH.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.954
- THAT IS QUITE A STREAK.

12:07.990 --> 12:10.254
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT
RELATIONSHIPS ARE TOUGH.

12:10.290 --> 12:12.895
AND SOMETIMES,
A MAN JUST NEEDS HIS SPACE.

12:12.930 --> 12:15.398
- DUDE, YOU WERE WITH RACHEL AND
MAXIMUS FOR WHAT, HALF A DAY?

12:15.430 --> 12:17.398
- SHAWN, TIME IS RELATIVE.
IT'S SEMANTICS.

12:17.430 --> 12:19.990
- I DON'T THINK IT'S SEMANTICS.
- [scoffs] YOU DON'T KNOW.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.258
- ALL RIGHT, CALL CAME IN
FROM AN EMPLOYEE

12:22.300 --> 12:23.938
AT A PRIVATE AIRFIELD
OUT ON ROUTE 7.

12:23.970 --> 12:26.234
APPARENTLY A SINGLE-ENGINE PLANE
JUST TOOK OFF

12:26.270 --> 12:28.773
WITH TWO MEN MATCHING
HENRY AND LLOYD'S DESCRIPTION.

12:28.810 --> 12:29.799
THEY WERE ALSO BEING SHOT AT
BY A BUNCH OF GUYS

12:29.850 --> 12:31.477
MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION
FROM OUR SHOOTERS HERE.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.068
- OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS JUST GETTING WORSE.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.849
DID THEY SAY
WHERE THEY WERE HEADED?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.472
- THEY DIDN'T FILE
A FLIGHT PLAN.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.919
- CAN WE TRACK THEM WITH RADAR?
- TRANSPONDER'S BEEN TURNED OFF.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.815
BUT IT TOOK OFF
TO THE SOUTH,

12:39.860 --> 12:42.511
AND THEY'VE ONLY GOT ENOUGH FUEL
FOR ABOUT 300 MILES.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.050
- BIG FAN OF BAJA, CALIFORNIA,
HUH, LLOYD?

12:44.090 --> 12:46.991
- I'M A BIT
OF A GEOGRAPHY NUT.

12:47.030 --> 12:50.488
- I'M NO LONGER CRAB BLOCKED.
I KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.964
- WHAT?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.332
- DON'T WORRY, HENRY.

12:55.370 --> 12:59.136
THINGS ARE GONNA GO MUCH
SMOOTHER FROM HERE ON IN.

12:59.170 --> 13:01.309
OH, YOU LOOK TIRED.
WHY DON'T YOU GRAB A NAP?

13:01.340 --> 13:03.001
- YOU STOLE THIS AIRPLANE,
YOU STOLE THE CADILLAC.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.575
THOSE ARE FELONIES.
YOU ARE IN BIG TROUBLE.

13:05.610 --> 13:06.975
- OH, RELAX.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.976
NO ONE STOLE ANYTHING.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.045
I RENTED THIS PLANE,
AND I'M FAIRLY CERTAIN

13:11.090 --> 13:14.856
THOSE HISPANIC GENTLEMEN STOLE
THAT CADILLAC FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

13:14.890 --> 13:16.312
THAT SHOULD MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.056
- IT DOESN'T. NOT ONE BIT.
- WELL, THEN THIS WILL.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.251
AFTER WE DELIVER THE PACKAGE,
LUNCH IS ON ME.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.063
BECAUSE I KNOW
A PLACE DOWN HERE.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.160
IT MAKES A DELICIOUS
CHICKEN SANDWICH.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.862
- IS THAT THE BORDER FENCE?
DID WE JUST CROSS THE BORDER?

13:28.900 --> 13:30.561
- WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,
WE SHOULD GET RID OF THAT FENCE.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.339
YOU KNOW?

13:32.370 --> 13:35.077
THIS IS AMERICA. IT'S THE LAND
OF EQUAL OPPORTUNITY.

13:35.110 --> 13:37.908
LET EVERYBODY IN!
AM I WRONG, HERE?

13:37.950 --> 13:40.009
- YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT GOING TO MEXICO.

13:40.050 --> 13:42.075
- I DID TOO. I SAID,
"MY FRIEND LIVES TO THE SOUTH."

13:42.120 --> 13:43.849
- THAT'S IT.
TURN THE PLANE AROUND.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.415
- NO, NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.
WE'RE PRACTICALLY THERE.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.156
AND...
[clicks]

13:48.190 --> 13:52.081
UH-OH, GOOD THING, TOO, BECAUSE
WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF FUEL.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.358
- WHAT? WHAT--

13:53.400 --> 13:54.992
I SURVIVED
A BULLET TO THE CHEST

13:55.030 --> 13:57.328
ONLY TO GO DOWN
IN A FIERY PLANE CRASH?

13:57.370 --> 13:59.167
- NO ONE IS GOING TO CRASH.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.339
I'VE DONE THIS SO MANY TIMES
ON THE SIMULATOR.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.258
- SIMULATOR?

14:03.310 --> 14:05.938
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU'VE
NEVER ACTUALLY LANDED A PLANE?

14:05.970 --> 14:10.043
- NOT THAT MANY TIMES.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.104
NOT EVER.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.243
THIS LOOK EVEN TO YOU?

14:13.280 --> 14:15.043
- OH...

14:17.120 --> 14:19.884
[engine sputtering]

14:21.960 --> 14:24.224
- THIS IS PRETTY EVEN, RIGHT?
OKAY, HERE WE GO...

14:24.260 --> 14:26.956
WHOOPS, THAT'S TOO MUCH.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.149
AH, THAT'S TOO LITTLE.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.169
AND THEY SAY TO BREATHE.
[breathes]

14:31.200 --> 14:34.033
AND...HOW YOU DOING?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:38.440 --> 14:42.137
[tires screech]

14:52.450 --> 14:56.489
ALL RIGHT.
THAT WASN'T SO BAD, WAS IT?

14:56.520 --> 14:59.387
SMOOTH SAILING
FROM HERE ON IN.

14:59.430 --> 15:02.399
- [gaSPSJ

15:02.430 --> 15:05.024
[siren wails]

15:05.070 --> 15:08.062
- [shouting in Spanish]

15:12.740 --> 15:14.935
[guns cocking]

15:17.150 --> 15:19.573
- HELLO, LLOYD.
WELCOME TO MEXICO.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.247
- EASY, EASY, EASY.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.416
OH, THAT HURTS.

15:25.450 --> 15:28.112
- OH, COME ON.

15:32.290 --> 15:34.121
- I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU, LLOYD.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.061
YOU'RE NOT A VERY
POPULAR PERSON DOWN HERE.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.523
YOUR FRIEND USED TO BET ON
EVERY BULL FIGHT AND CARD GAME

15:39.570 --> 15:41.333
FROM HERE TO CABO SAN JOSE.

15:41.370 --> 15:45.033
HE WAS ALSO KNOWN FOR LEAVING
TOWN WITHOUT PAYING HIS DEBTS.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.004
- FIRST OF ALL,
HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.429
- THAT'S A BIT HARSH,
DON'T YOU THINK?

15:49.480 --> 15:51.505
LAMAS,
MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD

15:51.550 --> 15:53.017
I DON'T GAMBLE ANYMORE,
I HAVEN'T FOR YEARS,

15:53.050 --> 15:54.972
AND I PAID BACK
EVERYTHING I OWE.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.284
- REALLY? THEN WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, LLOYD?

15:57.320 --> 15:58.582
- I COULD NOT
BE MORE INNOCENT.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.611
YOU SEE, HENRY AND I
CAME DOWN HERE

16:00.660 --> 16:03.128
TO PICK UP SOME OF YOUR
EXCELLENT COCA-COLA.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.754
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT YOURS TASTES BETTER.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.291
- IT'S BECAUSE
WE USE REAL SUGAR.

16:07.330 --> 16:08.649
- OH.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.122
- BUT I KNOW THAT IS NOT
WHY YOU ARE HERE.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.058
WORD HAS IT YOU'RE HERE

16:12.100 --> 16:14.034
TO DELIVER
A VERY IMPORTANT PACKAGE

16:14.070 --> 16:16.129
TO PABLO NUNEZ.

16:16.170 --> 16:18.661
- THAT PABLO NUNEZ?

16:18.710 --> 16:22.498
- I HAPPEN TO KNOW
YOU STILL OWE HIM MUCHO DINERO.

16:22.540 --> 16:26.271
AND I THINK IN THIS PACKAGE
ARE THE ENGRAVING PLATES

16:26.310 --> 16:28.016
RECENTLY STOLEN
FROM THE US. MINT.

16:28.050 --> 16:30.018
THE SAME PLATES PABLO

16:30.050 --> 16:31.347
HAS BEEN TRYING
TO GET HIS HANDS ON.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.085
- WELL, THIS IS WORSE
THAN I THOUGHT, LLOYD.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.781
I'VE INVOLVED ME IN
A SERIOUS FEDERAL CRIME, HERE.

16:34.820 --> 16:38.153
- HENRY, I ADMIT I HAVEN'T
ALWAYS BEEN UP FRONT WITH YOU,

16:38.190 --> 16:40.192
BUT I SWEAR TO YOU
ON JULIA'S LIFE--

16:40.230 --> 16:41.458
- STOP SWEARING
ON HER LIFE!

16:41.500 --> 16:44.025
- THE PLATES ARE NOT
IN THAT BOX.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.162
- AND I'M SUPPOSED TO
BELIEVE THAT.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.065
- YES.

16:47.100 --> 16:48.761
BELIEVE I'VE EARNED THAT.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.336
AFTER ALL, I'VE SAVED YOUR LIFE.
- WHAT?

16:50.370 --> 16:52.235
- NO, I'M GONNA
GO A STEP FURTHER.

16:52.270 --> 16:54.079
I'VE IMPROVED YOUR LIFE.

16:54.110 --> 16:55.805
- HOW THE HELL HAVE YOU
MADE MY LIFE BETTER?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.603
- WELL, FOR STARTERS,
YOU'RE ON VACATION.

16:57.650 --> 17:02.178
AND YOU'RE ALREADY GETTING
THE BASIS OF A REALLY NICE TAN.

17:02.220 --> 17:06.247
- THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

17:19.130 --> 17:20.791
- CUFF LINKS?

17:20.840 --> 17:23.434
THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

17:25.870 --> 17:27.735
- YOU ARE LUCKY

17:27.780 --> 17:30.248
THAT I GOT TO YOU
FIRST, AMIGOS.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.248
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE TO TRY
TO PASS THIS OFF TO PABLO,

17:32.280 --> 17:34.840
WHEN HE THOUGHT HE WAS
GETTING THE ENGRAVING PLATES,

17:34.880 --> 17:38.213
YOU WOULD HAVE
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.582
- WELL, AS I SAID,
WE'RE JUST DOWN HERE FOR POP.

17:40.620 --> 17:41.712
- CAN WE GO NOW?

17:41.760 --> 17:43.352
- YES.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.381
BUT FORGET ABOUT
YOUR DELICIOUS SODA,

17:45.430 --> 17:47.796
STRAIGHTEN OUT
YOUR FLIGHT PLAN, AND LEAVE

17:47.830 --> 17:51.288
BEFORE SOMETHING MUY MALO
HAPPENS TO YOU GUYS.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.867
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, LLOYD.

17:53.900 --> 17:57.461
- THANK YOU, LAMAS.
MAY I?

17:57.510 --> 18:00.775
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

18:03.780 --> 18:06.305
[chickens clucking]

18:09.620 --> 18:10.882
- SHAWN,
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU MADE ME

18:10.920 --> 18:13.115
STOP AND PICK UP
THESE CHICKENS.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.118
- LOOK, JULES, YOU CAN'T FIND
PRICES LIKE THIS IN THE STATES.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.788
WE ACTUALLY WOULD'VE LOST MONEY
BY NOT BUYING THEM.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.889
- CHICKENS, SON.

18:20.930 --> 18:22.158
- MY GOD, MY MOM
IS GONNA BE SO DEVASTATED

18:22.200 --> 18:23.792
WHEN SHE LEARNS
THE TRUTH ABOUT LLOYD.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.229
- PEOPLE AREN'T ALWAYS
AS THEY SEEM.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.158
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.293
I SEEM LIKE THIS
GREAT DAD AND WHATNOT.

18:29.340 --> 18:32.707
THE TRUTH IS
I ABANDONED MY FAMILY.

18:32.740 --> 18:34.879
I'M A BLACK STEREOTYPE.
- WOW.

18:34.910 --> 18:37.140
- SO MANY THINGS
WRONG WITH THAT STATEMENT,

18:37.180 --> 18:38.249
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO BEGIN.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.804
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.

18:39.850 --> 18:41.374
YOU'RE NO ONE'S FATHER.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.285
- SHAWN, IT'S SEMANTICS.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.582
- NO, IT'S NOT SEMANTICS.
- YES, IT IS, SHAWN, IT'S SE--

18:44.620 --> 18:46.144
- WOULD YOU TWO
STOP JABBERING

18:46.190 --> 18:47.384
AND START LOOKING
FOR HENRY AND LLOYD?

18:47.420 --> 18:48.785
LOOK, LASSITER
DID ME A SOLID,

18:48.820 --> 18:50.253
AND HE'S HOLDING OFF THE CHIEF
FOR 24 HOURS,

18:50.290 --> 18:51.757
SO WE HAVE TO FIND THEM.

18:51.790 --> 18:53.621
- YOU ALREADY TOLD US THAT
IN THE CAR, JULES.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.457
- WELL, I NEED
TO COVER MY BASES, GUYS.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.627
- FOR WHO?

18:57.670 --> 19:02.460
- THINK WE NEED
TO GO THIS WAY.

19:02.500 --> 19:05.867
- YES, SIR.

19:05.910 --> 19:08.470
UH-HUH. THANK YOU.
- DE NADA.

19:08.510 --> 19:11.843
- OH, HENRY,
YOU GOTTA TRY ONE OF THESE.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.713
SAN CARLOS IS KNOWN
FOR ITS SOPAPILLAS.

19:14.750 --> 19:15.819
- I'M NOT HUNGRY, LLOYD.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.442
- MM, YOUR TASTE BUDS
WILL THANK YOU.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.185
SEE, WHAT YOU DO
IS YOU TAKE A LITTLE HONEY,

19:19.220 --> 19:21.450
AND YOU PUT IT
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE,

19:21.490 --> 19:23.720
AND BAM! YOU ARE IN
MEXICAN PASTRY HEAVEN.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.625
- I DON'T WANT
ANY DAMN SOPAPILLAS, LLOYD.

19:25.660 --> 19:27.855
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS HOW THE
HELL WE'RE GONNA GET OUTTA HERE.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.822
WE HAVE NO CAR, NO MONEY...

19:29.860 --> 19:31.691
NO SHOELACES.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.834
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
LAMAS HAD TO CONFISCATE MINE.

19:33.870 --> 19:35.497
- OH, YEAH, WELL,

19:35.540 --> 19:36.893
THAT'S STANDARD
MEXICAN POLICE PROCEDURE.

19:36.940 --> 19:37.907
THAT'S WHY
WHENEVER I'M DOWN HERE,

19:37.940 --> 19:39.339
I MAKE SURE TO WEAR LOAFERS.

19:39.370 --> 19:40.701
- WELL, THAT'S
A LOT OF HELP TO ME NOW.

19:40.740 --> 19:43.709
THANK YOU.
- COME ON. COME ON.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.399
HAVE A SOPAPILLA.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.645
[high voice, Mexican accent]
HI, I'M MR. SOPAPILLA.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.671
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO EAT ME.

19:49.720 --> 19:54.350
COME ON, EAT ME.
EAT ME.

19:54.390 --> 19:57.951
- I SMELL SOMETHING.
[sniffs]

19:57.990 --> 19:59.855
BA'I'I'ERED. ..
[sniffs]

19:59.890 --> 20:00.857
FRIED...

20:00.900 --> 20:03.460
[sniffs]
SWEET.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.922
both: SOPAPILLAS!

20:04.970 --> 20:06.392
- OH, MY GOD.

20:06.430 --> 20:07.795
- MM, ONE MORE.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.796
COME ON, YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.
- NO.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.308
AND WHY ARE YOU STILL WEARING
THAT STUPID JACKET IN THIS HEAT?

20:12.340 --> 20:15.400
IT'S LIKE A STEAM BATH
DOWN HERE. TAKE IT OFF.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.840
- CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED,
BUT I BELIEVE A MAN

20:17.880 --> 20:19.939
SHOULD LOOK WELL-DRESSED
WHEREVER HE HAPPENS TO BE.

20:19.980 --> 20:20.947
- WHATEVER.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.971
- DON'T WORRY, HENRY.

20:23.020 --> 20:25.409
WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF THIS.
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN.

20:25.450 --> 20:29.216
IT ALWAYS DOES. YOU SEE?
- [grunting]

20:30.590 --> 20:32.751
- DOS, POR FAVOR.
- NO MAS.

20:32.790 --> 20:33.791
both: HOMBRE!

20:33.830 --> 20:34.797
- THAT'S...
- MAN!

20:34.830 --> 20:36.798
IN SPANISH.

20:36.830 --> 20:41.392
- WHAT?

20:41.440 --> 20:43.032
- WAS YOUR
LAST CUSTOMER AMERICAN?

20:43.070 --> 20:45.800
AMER--AMERICANO?
- SI, COMPRE SEIS.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.035
- AH. I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S SAYING.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.934
- WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?
[speaks Spanish]

20:49.980 --> 20:51.470
- MUY ELEGANTE.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.410
- THAT'S LLOYD.
- UH-HUH.

20:53.450 --> 20:55.372
AND WAS HE WITH ANOTHER MAN?
EL BALDO?

20:55.420 --> 20:59.049
WEARING A, UH, CAMISETA...
COSTCO?

20:59.090 --> 21:02.309
- SI.
[speaks Spanish]

21:02.360 --> 21:04.578
- DONDE?
- [speaks Spanish]

21:04.630 --> 21:05.654
- YEAH, YEAH.

21:05.690 --> 21:07.351
GRA--GRACIAS. GRACIAS.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.762
[tires screech]

21:25.780 --> 21:27.316
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

21:27.350 --> 21:29.545
- DO THEY OBSERVE
THE 10-SECOND RULE DOWN HERE?

21:29.580 --> 21:32.481
- OH, NO.
- YEAH.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.953
- [blows]

21:33.990 --> 21:35.981
- STOP IT.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.798
- [chuckles]

21:42.830 --> 21:44.092
LLOYD.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.893
- PABLO.
- NUNEZ.

21:45.930 --> 21:49.093
- IT IS SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU, MY FRIEND.

21:49.140 --> 21:51.005
- YOU TOO.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.975
- IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?
- YES, SIR.

21:54.010 --> 21:57.104
- IS THAT THE PACKAGE I HAVE
BEEN SEARCHING SO INTENTLY FOR?

21:57.140 --> 21:59.870
- YES.

21:59.910 --> 22:02.617
- AND BY "YES,"
HE MEANS IT'S "A PACKAGE,"

22:02.650 --> 22:07.519
NOT NECESSARILY
"THE PACKAGE."

22:07.560 --> 22:09.687
- LLOYD...

22:09.720 --> 22:13.929
I ASK YOU TO BRING ME
SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT.

22:13.960 --> 22:16.952
SOMETHING OTHER MEN HAVE DIED
TRYING TO GET THEIR HANDS ON.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.719
AND YOU...

22:19.770 --> 22:22.568
TOTALLY DELIVERED!

22:22.600 --> 22:24.932
YEAH!
[laughs]

22:24.970 --> 22:26.938
- WAIT--

22:26.970 --> 22:30.371
ALL YOU REALLY EVER WANTED
WAS A PAIR OF CRAPPY CUFFLINKS?

22:30.410 --> 22:31.946
- CRAPPY?
[gun cocks]

22:31.980 --> 22:33.538
- UH, PLEASE, PABLO.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.116
MY FRIEND HENRY
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

22:35.150 --> 22:37.015
HOW VALUABLE
THOSE ARE TO YOU.

22:37.050 --> 22:37.948
- THESE CUFFLINKS
BELONGED TO MY FATHER,

22:37.990 --> 22:39.878
A POOR, HARD-WORKING MAN

22:39.920 --> 22:42.081
WHO ALWAYS TAUGHT ME
TO DO THE HONEST THING.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.985
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT
I NEVER LISTENED.

22:44.030 --> 22:47.625
[laughter]

22:47.660 --> 22:49.150
I CRACK THEM UP.
[laughs]

22:49.200 --> 22:51.088
ANYWAY. ..

22:51.130 --> 22:52.927
HIS DYING WISH
WAS TO BE BURIED

22:52.970 --> 22:54.858
WEARING THESE CUFFLINKS.

22:54.900 --> 22:57.664
HE BELIEVED A MAN
SHOULD LOOK HIS BEST,

22:57.710 --> 22:59.029
WHEREVER HE MAY BE.

22:59.070 --> 23:01.038
- COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.900
- AT THE FUNERAL,
SOME LOWDOWN DOG

23:02.940 --> 23:05.841
STOLE THEM OFF
MY FATHER'S BODY.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.074
PROBABLY MY COUSIN PEDRO.

23:07.110 --> 23:09.647
OR MY OTHER COUSIN PEDRO.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.045
OR HIS DAUGHTER, PEDRITA.

23:11.090 --> 23:14.457
THEY HAVE BEEN
MISSING FOR YEARS.

23:14.490 --> 23:15.957
WHEN LLOYD TOLD ME
HE COULD TRACK THEM DOWN,

23:15.990 --> 23:19.858
I SAY, "THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE."

23:19.890 --> 23:21.551
WELL, HERE THEY ARE.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.421
TELL ME, WHO DID YOU
HAVE TO KILL TO GET THESE?

23:24.470 --> 23:26.426
- OH, NO, NO.

23:26.470 --> 23:29.530
IT MOSTLY INVOLVED GOOGLING,
TROLLING AROUND ON EBAY.

23:29.570 --> 23:32.004
BUT THE POINT IS
YOU HAVE THEM BACK,

23:32.040 --> 23:35.009
AND MY DEBT TO YOU
IS FORGIVEN, YES?

23:35.040 --> 23:37.838
- [laughs] CONSIDER IT
PAID IN FULL, AMIGO.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.474
- OH, THAT IS WONDERFUL NEWS.

23:40.520 --> 23:41.976
DO YOU HEAR THAT, HENRY?

23:42.020 --> 23:44.011
MY--MY SLATE HAS FINALLY
BEEN WIPED CLEAN.

23:44.050 --> 23:46.484
- THAT'S GREAT.
UH, LLOYD, COULD WE GO NOW?

23:46.520 --> 23:48.488
- GO?
NO, NO, WE MUST CELEBRATE.

23:48.520 --> 23:49.953
I HAVE A FEAST PREPARED.

23:49.990 --> 23:51.924
I JUST INSTALLED
A DISCOTHEQUE IN MY BASEMENT.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.827
NO, YOU ARE STAYING
THE NIGHT AS MY GUESTS.

23:54.860 --> 23:56.088
- WELL, THAT SOUNDS
REALLY TEMPTING,

23:56.130 --> 23:57.859
BUT MY TRUCK IS PARKED
AT A METER, AND I--

23:57.900 --> 23:59.026
[gun cocks]

23:59.070 --> 24:00.958
- YOU REFUSING
MY HOSPITALITY?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.059
- WHAT HENRY MEANT WAS, UH,

24:03.100 --> 24:08.072
WE WOULD LOVE TO STAY,
WOULDN'T WE, HENRY?

24:08.110 --> 24:10.874
- I NEVER SAY NO TO DISCO.

24:10.910 --> 24:15.518
- [speaks Spanish]
VAMANOS.

24:15.550 --> 24:16.949
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- PAYASO.

24:16.980 --> 24:18.880
- WHAT'S A PAYASO?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

24:21.220 --> 24:23.984
- DETECTIVE LAMAS.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.952
JULIET O'HARA,
SANTA BARBARA P.D.

24:25.990 --> 24:27.719
WE WOULD LIKE
TO REPORT A KIDNAPPING.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.557
- REALLY? OF WHO?

24:29.600 --> 24:31.727
- OUR FATHERS. OUR PADRES.
- DID YOU SEE THIS HAPPEN?

24:31.770 --> 24:33.829
- NO, BUT WE HAVE STRONG REASON
TO BELIEVE THEY WERE TAKEN.

24:33.870 --> 24:35.861
WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU WOULD RUN A CHECK

24:35.900 --> 24:38.039
ON ALL LATE-MODEL
RANGE ROVERS IN THE AREA.

24:38.070 --> 24:39.560
- I AM SORRY.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.908
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
TO WARRANT SUCH A SEARCH,

24:41.940 --> 24:46.877
AND MY STAFF
IS OVERWORKED AS IT IS.

24:46.910 --> 24:49.845
- AH. ENJOY THAT AGE.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.986
IT'S A GREAT ONE.
WHAT GRADE IS YOUR SON IN?

24:53.020 --> 24:54.988
SECOND?
- HE DOES NOT GO TO SCHOOL.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.989
HE IS TOO BUSY MAKING
THOSE SNEAKERS YOU'RE WEARING.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.850
I KID YOU.
- [laughs]

24:59.890 --> 25:01.926
- HE'S A DOCTOR.
- OH.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.598
- I KID YOU AGAIN.

25:03.630 --> 25:05.097
YOU'RE SO GULLIBLE.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.223
[laughs]

25:07.270 --> 25:09.989
- DETECTIVE LAMAS,
I DID SEE IT HAPPEN.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.702
BUT NOT WITH THESE EYES.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.537
WITH THIS ONE.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.775
SHAWN SPENCER, PSYCHIC.

25:16.810 --> 25:20.177
EL PSYCHICO?

25:20.210 --> 25:22.178
- I DO NOT
BELIEVE IN SUCH THINGS.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.711
CONTRARY TO YOUR
STEREOTYPE OF MEJICANOS,

25:24.750 --> 25:26.081
WE ARE NOT ALL
SUPERSTITIOUS IDIOTS

25:26.120 --> 25:29.908
WHO STAND AT THE WINDOW
LOOKING OUT FOR THE CHUPACABRA.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.679
- HEY, WHO DOES HE
REMIND YOU OF?

25:32.730 --> 25:35.619
- ERIC ESTRADA?
- NO.

25:35.660 --> 25:38.629
- THE MEXICAN VERSION
OF LASSITER.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.092
- EH.

25:40.130 --> 25:42.132
I GOTTA FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO GET HIM TO HELP US.

26:08.330 --> 26:11.822
- I'M GETTING SOME
VERY POWERFUL PSYCHIC VIBRATIONS

26:11.870 --> 26:13.997
ABOUT THE PEOPLE
IN THIS ROOM.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.928
FOR STARTERS,
DETECTIVE ORTIZ

26:15.970 --> 26:17.767
IS ABOUT TO GO
INTO A DIABETIC COMA.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.062
- YOU ATE SUGAR?
- I ONLY HAD ONE BITE.

26:20.110 --> 26:23.238
- GUZMAN IS BACK ON CAFFEINE.
- CAN'T HELP IT. GET SLEEPY.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.702
- AND THERE IS NOT ONE,
BUT DOS

26:24.750 --> 26:27.344
INTER-OFFICE ROMANCES
HAPPENING HERE.

26:27.380 --> 26:29.940
AND BOTH OF THEM
INVOLVE DETECTIVE LAMAS.

26:29.980 --> 26:30.981
A MARRIED MAN.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.885
- [gaSPSJ

26:32.920 --> 26:35.354
[women bicker in Spanish]

26:38.660 --> 26:39.888
- DIABLO.

26:39.930 --> 26:43.798
- SI.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

26:43.830 --> 26:45.798
GIANT CLOWN GLOVES.

26:45.830 --> 26:47.297
FINALLY, A HOUSEWARMING GIFT
WE CAN USE.

26:47.330 --> 26:49.036
- THEY'RE OVEN MITTS.

26:49.070 --> 26:50.628
- I AM ALSO SENSING
THAT DETECTIVE LAMAS

26:50.670 --> 26:52.160
HAS NOT BEEN
TRUTHFUL WITH US.

26:52.210 --> 26:55.930
OUR FATHERS, OUR PADRES
WERE HERE, WEREN'T THEY?

26:55.980 --> 26:58.676
- YOUR SKILLS
ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE.

26:58.710 --> 27:00.302
OKAY, I ADMIT IT.

27:00.350 --> 27:02.773
THEY WERE HERE EARLIER,
AND IF THEY WERE KIDNAPPED,

27:02.820 --> 27:04.879
IT WAS PROBABLY
BY PABLO NUNEZ.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.218
IT IS WIDELY KNOWN
PABLO HAS BEEN SEEKING

27:07.250 --> 27:09.059
THE ENGRAVING PLATES
STOLEN FROM THE US. MINT.

27:09.090 --> 27:11.923
AND I BELIEVE THAT LLOYD
AND UM, THE BALD ONE...

27:11.960 --> 27:15.396
WERE TRYING TO FOOL PABLO INTO
BELIEVING THEY HAVE THE PLATES.

27:15.430 --> 27:17.967
- DO YOU HAVE AN ADDRESS
FOR THIS "PABLA" NUNEZ?

27:18.000 --> 27:19.922
- PABLO LIVES IN A COMPOUND

27:19.970 --> 27:21.790
GUARDED BY HIS
OWN PERSONAL ARMY.

27:21.840 --> 27:22.932
- WE COULD REALLY
USE YOUR HELP

27:22.970 --> 27:24.005
IN GETTING
OUR FATHERS OUT OF THERE.

27:24.040 --> 27:25.405
- THAT I CANNOT DO.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.931
I CANNOT RISK THE LIVES
OF MY MEN, HOWEVER,

27:27.980 --> 27:30.949
IF YOU WERE TO FIND OUT

27:30.980 --> 27:33.073
THAT THE PLATES
WERE ON THE PREMISES,

27:33.110 --> 27:36.944
I COULD CALL IN
REINFORCEMENTS.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.039
- I SEE.

27:39.090 --> 27:42.082
AND I TAKE IT THIS
PABLO NUNEZ'S COMPOUND

27:42.120 --> 27:43.382
IS LOCATED AT THIS

27:43.420 --> 27:45.149
[American accent]
"LAS GRAVEDAS"?

27:45.190 --> 27:47.021
- GRAVEDAS.
- GRAV--GRAV-DAZ?

27:47.060 --> 27:48.197
- GRAVEDAS.
- GRAMEDES.

27:48.230 --> 27:50.391
- GRAVEDAS.
- GRAVEDAS.

27:50.430 --> 27:52.068
- YES.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.260
- "J ESS"?

27:53.300 --> 27:55.439
- YES.
- I BELIEVE IT'S A SOFT "J."

27:55.470 --> 27:57.267
- YES.
- AND IT'S LOCATED THERE.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.200
- NO.
- MM.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.004
- THAT IS WHERE PABLO'S MEN
SHOOT HIS ENEMIES AND BURY THEM.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.349
USUALLY FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

28:04.380 --> 28:08.419
- WHILE
THE CHUPACABRA SLEEPS.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.270
[rooster crows]

28:10.320 --> 28:12.288
- [laughs]
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

28:12.320 --> 28:13.958
THANK YOU
FOR THE HOSPITALITY.

28:13.990 --> 28:15.958
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.855
- I GOTTA SAY I HAD
A REALLY GREAT TIME.

28:17.890 --> 28:19.255
THAT LOBSTER THERMADOR--

28:19.290 --> 28:21.394
OH, IT PRACTICALLY
MELTED IN MY MOUTH.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.125
- ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO STAY ANY LONGER?

28:23.160 --> 28:25.025
- WELL...
- WE COULD PLAY TENNIS,

28:25.070 --> 28:26.867
HAVE A SWIM,
AND IT'S TUESDAY,

28:26.900 --> 28:27.969
WHICH IS THE NIGHT
WE PLAY CELEBRITY.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.763
- OH, I LOVE THAT GAME.

28:29.800 --> 28:34.032
- YEAH, WELL, WE REALLY HAVE TO
GET BACK. LET'S GO, HENRY.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.469
- ALL RIGHT.
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE.

28:36.510 --> 28:37.909
- AMIGO.
- COME BACK ANYTIME.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.804
YOU.
- YES.

28:39.850 --> 28:41.272
- STAY OUT OF TROUBLE, HUH?
- I'LL--I'LL TRY.

28:41.320 --> 28:44.289
THANK YOU AGAIN.
- ADIOS.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.185
JEEZ, WHAT'S THE RUSH?

28:46.220 --> 28:47.858
IS THAT--
- SHH, SHH.

28:47.890 --> 28:49.414
THE STOLEN
ENGRAVING PLATES.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.519
I CAME ACROSS THEM WHEN I WAS
LOOKING FOR THE BATHROOM.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.826
LAMAS DIDN'T KNOW
THAT PABLO ALREADY HAD THEM.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.122
- WAIT, WAIT, YOU STOLE

28:57.160 --> 28:58.468
THE ENGRAVING PLATES
FROM PABLO NUNEZ?

28:58.500 --> 28:59.922
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

28:59.970 --> 29:01.528
- AT FIRST I WAS
AFRAID TO TAKE THEM,

29:01.570 --> 29:04.209
BUT THEN I SAID, "WHAT WOULD
HENRY DO IN THIS SITUATION?"

29:04.240 --> 29:06.231
SO, I DID IT, I TOOK THEM.
I KNEW YOU'D BE PROUD.

29:06.270 --> 29:07.874
- [speaks Spanish]

29:07.910 --> 29:09.377
- RUN!

29:09.410 --> 29:11.503
- HEY! HEY!

29:15.220 --> 29:16.915
- SERPICO, HENRY!

29:16.950 --> 29:18.383
- SERPENTINE, YOU IDIOT!
- OH.

29:18.420 --> 29:20.786
FIGURE EIGHT!

29:20.820 --> 29:22.481
- LET'S GET TO THE TRUCK,
THE TRUCK!

29:22.520 --> 29:25.785
both: OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

29:25.830 --> 29:30.199
[gunfire]

29:30.230 --> 29:31.891
- WHAT'RE YOU WAITING FOR?
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

29:31.930 --> 29:33.898
- AH--I NEVER
LEARNED A STICK.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.965
- WHAT, YOU CAN FLY A PLANE,
BUT YOU CAN'T HANDLE A STICK?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.798
- NO.
- [speaking Spanish]

29:38.840 --> 29:39.909
- MOVE OVER.

29:39.940 --> 29:43.307
- CAREFUL, I HAVE--
- OKAY, OKAY.

29:43.340 --> 29:46.878
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
- OW, OW.

29:46.910 --> 29:47.945
[truck engine fires]

29:47.980 --> 29:51.040
[gunfire]

29:53.120 --> 29:56.009
[tire blows]
- WHOA.

29:56.060 --> 30:01.054
[men shouting]

30:01.100 --> 30:02.522
- OH, HEY, NACHO. OH!

30:08.500 --> 30:09.967
- I SHOULD MAKE YOU
DIG YOURS AND MINE

30:10.000 --> 30:11.968
FOR GETTING US
INTO THIS MESS.

30:12.010 --> 30:12.999
- I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
THE APPROPRIATE TIME

30:13.040 --> 30:14.598
TO BE POINTING
FINGERS, HENRY.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.471
- WHEN EXACTLY WOULD BE
THE APPROPRIATE TIME, LLOYD?

30:16.510 --> 30:18.569
WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.168
- I USUALLY DON'T
COME OUT FOR THE KILLINGS,

30:20.210 --> 30:22.974
WHICH SHOWS YOU HOW SPECIAL
YOU ARE TO ME, LLOYD.

30:23.020 --> 30:25.079
AND HENRY, I WAS ONLY
STARTING TO GET TO KNOW YOU,

30:25.120 --> 30:26.917
BUT I WAS IMPRESSED
WITH THE DANCE MOVES

30:26.950 --> 30:28.611
LAST NIGHT
ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.959
WHAT WAS THAT DANCE?
- CABBAGE PATCH.

30:31.990 --> 30:34.629
- [chuckles]
YES, CABBAGE PATCH.

30:34.660 --> 30:36.298
CHICO AND NACHO CAN'T STOP.

30:36.330 --> 30:38.059
[laughs]

30:38.100 --> 30:41.638
[cell phone ringing]

30:41.670 --> 30:43.365
- [speaking Spanish]

30:43.400 --> 30:45.436
- ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

30:45.470 --> 30:47.006
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
- WHAT?

30:47.040 --> 30:48.109
- WHAT'S THE PLAN?

30:48.140 --> 30:50.005
- THERE'S NO PLAN.

30:50.040 --> 30:52.543
BUT I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

30:52.580 --> 30:54.172
- ME? YOU'RE THE EXPERT
IN THIS SITUATION.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.939
- ALL RIGHT.
I'LL COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.448
- [sighs] WELL?

30:59.490 --> 31:01.981
- I'VE GOT NOTHING.
TOTAL BLANK.

31:08.530 --> 31:12.398
- WHAT DO YOU SEE?
- UH...

31:12.430 --> 31:14.239
LLOYD AND MY FATHER

31:14.270 --> 31:17.398
ARE DIGGING
THEIR OWN GRAVES.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.260
IT'S GRIM.

31:19.310 --> 31:23.030
BUT PABLO'S HENCHMEN APPEAR
TO BE DOING THE CABBAGE PATCH.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.445
- OKAY, WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF TIME, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

31:24.480 --> 31:29.042
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
HOLD UP.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.389
PABLO HAS
THE ENGRAVING PLATES.

31:31.420 --> 31:34.059
[gun cocks]

31:34.090 --> 31:38.527
OH, GOSH.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.380
[sighs]

31:40.430 --> 31:43.649
- UH, JULIET,
I KNOW THIS LOOKS BAD.

31:43.700 --> 31:46.498
SO, I'M GONNA JUST
TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

31:46.530 --> 31:49.033
I WAS DOWN HERE
DOING THIS GENTLEMAN'S TAXES.

31:49.070 --> 31:51.106
- OH, SAVE IT, LLOYD.
I KNOW ABOUT YOUR GAMBLING.

31:51.140 --> 31:52.334
- YOU TOLD HER?

31:52.370 --> 31:54.338
- WHEN DID I HAVE TIME
TO DO THAT, LLOYD?

31:54.380 --> 31:57.269
- UH, PALO, I NOTICED
THAT THERE ARE TWO GRAVES

31:57.310 --> 32:01.178
DUG HERE,
AND YET THERE ARE FIVE OF US.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.643
- OBVIOUSLY,
YOU WILL HAVE TO SHARE.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.113
- YES, BUT I THINK
I SPEAK FOR THE GROUP

32:05.150 --> 32:08.085
WHEN I SAY
WHO SHARES WITH WHO?

32:08.120 --> 32:12.056
- I AM NOT GOING WITH LLOYD.
- WHY DO YOU HURT ME?

32:12.090 --> 32:13.318
- CONSIDERING THAT JULIET AND I
ARE THE LONE COUPLE

32:13.360 --> 32:15.055
IN THE GROUP,
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR

32:15.100 --> 32:18.024
THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN GRAVE.
- EXCUSE ME.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.992
AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,
I'VE EARNED THE RIGHT

32:20.030 --> 32:21.634
TO REST BESIDE YOU
JUST AS MUCH AS JULES.

32:21.670 --> 32:23.729
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
IF NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE GUS,

32:23.770 --> 32:25.328
I'LL TAKE HIM, LLOYD,
WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH THOSE TWO?

32:25.370 --> 32:26.405
- MAN, I'M NOBODY'S
CHARITY CASE.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.579
I DEMAND TO DIG MY OWN GRAVE.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.134
- ENOUGH! NO MORE STALLING.

32:30.180 --> 32:32.171
I'VE BEEN OUT HERE
TOO LONG ALREADY.

32:32.210 --> 32:35.475
- [whimpering]
FINE. GIVE THIS TO MY SON.

32:35.520 --> 32:36.509
TELL HIM I WAS BRAVE.

32:36.550 --> 32:39.747
- OKAY.

32:39.790 --> 32:42.008
- YOU COME WITH US, BUDDY.
WE'LL PROBABLY GO THREE ACROSS.

32:42.060 --> 32:45.029
- GET IN THE GRAVES!

32:45.060 --> 32:46.618
- I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS IS A JUMP, OR--

32:46.660 --> 32:49.652
[gunfire]
- [shouting in Spanish]

32:53.030 --> 32:56.989
- MEXICAN LASSIE!
- [speaking Spanish]

32:57.040 --> 32:58.302
- MEXICAN LASSIE.

32:58.340 --> 33:00.069
WAY BETTER THAN
AMERICAN LASSIE, BY THE WAY.

33:00.110 --> 33:02.328
NOT UNLIKE COCA-COLA.
- THAT'S WHY YOU WERE STALLING.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.506
HOW DID YOU KNOW
LAMAS WOULD SHOW UP?

33:03.540 --> 33:05.542
- SHAWN TEXTED ME.
- WHEN?

33:05.580 --> 33:07.468
WE'VE BEEN HELD AT GUNPOINT
THE WHOLE TIME.

33:07.510 --> 33:09.114
- I MANAGED TO DO IT
WHILE PABLO

33:09.150 --> 33:11.243
AND HIS HENCHMEN
WERE DOING THE CABBAGE PATCH.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.178
- UH, CAN I GET MY WATCH BACK?

33:13.220 --> 33:16.712
- BECAUSE OF YOU,
PABLO LEFT HIS COMPOUND

33:16.760 --> 33:19.126
AND GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY
TO ARREST HIM

33:19.160 --> 33:21.492
AND RECOVER
THE ENGRAVING PLATES.

33:21.530 --> 33:24.021
I'VE CONTACTED YOUR EMBASSY,
AND THEY ARE SENDING OFFICIALS

33:24.070 --> 33:26.163
TO GET THE PLATES
AS WE SPEAK.

33:26.200 --> 33:29.135
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
OUR WORK HERE IS DONE.

33:29.170 --> 33:32.264
NOW, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I HAVE A FAMILY TO GET BACK TO.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.676
VIA TOSTITOS,
MEXICAN LASSIE.

33:34.710 --> 33:36.109
- STOP CALLING ME THAT.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.607
- CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR ONE SECOND?

33:37.640 --> 33:39.540
- LLOYD, NO,
YOU LIED TO MY MOM.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.116
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN FRANK.

33:41.150 --> 33:42.777
- OKAY, LOOK,
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET WITH ME.

33:42.820 --> 33:45.288
AND I--I DON'T BLAME YOU.

33:45.320 --> 33:47.288
BUT ALL I EVER WANTED TO DO WAS
BE THE MAN YOU THOUGHT I WAS,

33:47.320 --> 33:49.788
THE MAN I TRIED
TO BECOME AFTER...

33:49.820 --> 33:52.152
MEETING YOUR MOTHER.

33:52.190 --> 33:55.648
UM, WOULD YOU--

33:55.700 --> 33:57.099
[whispers]
WOULD YOU MIND IF WE DIDN'T

33:57.130 --> 34:01.134
TELL YOUR MOM
ABOUT ANY OF THIS?

34:01.170 --> 34:03.263
SHE'S THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

34:03.300 --> 34:05.666
- WELL, YOU DID
RECOVER THE PLATES.

34:05.710 --> 34:09.134
I GUESS THAT DOES
COUNT FOR SOMETHING.

34:09.180 --> 34:11.478
ALL RIGHT,
I WILL KEEP THIS TO MYSELF.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.341
FOR NOW.

34:13.380 --> 34:15.746
BUT, LLOYD, I'M WATCHING YOU,
AND I PROMISE, IF YOU EVER--

34:15.780 --> 34:19.819
- DONE. NO MORE. NO MORE.
NO, I SWEAR.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.454
- I WILL TRY TO CONVINCE
THE JUDGE IN SANTA BARBARA

34:21.490 --> 34:24.129
TO WAIVE THE CHARGES
FOR STEALING THE CADILLAC

34:24.160 --> 34:25.821
AND CROSSING
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY,

34:25.860 --> 34:28.124
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT PLANE
BACK TO WHERE IT BELONGS.

34:28.160 --> 34:30.094
- OKAY, THAT'S--I PROMISE.
- O-OKAY.

34:30.130 --> 34:31.495
- THAT IS TERRIFIC.

34:31.530 --> 34:34.397
OKAY, I NEED A COPILOT.
WHO WANTS TO GO WITH ME?

34:34.440 --> 34:35.862
- NO WAY IN HELL.

34:35.900 --> 34:38.607
- SENSITIVE GUY.

34:38.640 --> 34:41.370
I'M GONNA FILE A FLIGHT PLAN.
BE RIGHT BACK.

34:44.710 --> 34:46.405
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:46.450 --> 34:48.873
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE GET BACK
TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,

34:48.920 --> 34:51.309
I'M GONNA SET UP
A LITTLE LUNCH FOR THOSE TWO.

34:51.350 --> 34:55.309
OR WE'LL JUST--WE'LL LET
NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE.

35:04.370 --> 35:07.828
- [gaSPSJ
THANK GOD YOU'RE OKAY.

35:07.870 --> 35:09.758
- I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

35:09.800 --> 35:10.892
- WELL, WHEN YOU DIDN'T
MEET US AT THE EYE DOCTOR,

35:10.940 --> 35:12.339
WE CAME LOOKING FOR YOU.

35:12.370 --> 35:13.803
DETECTIVE LASSITER
EXPLAINED EVERYTHING.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.376
WE'VE BEEN
SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

35:15.410 --> 35:17.674
- WHAT I DID, LEAVING LIKE THAT
WITHOUT CALLING YOU,

35:17.710 --> 35:20.247
THAT WAS WRONG.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.510
I'M SORRY I LEFT, BUDDY.

35:22.550 --> 35:25.519
I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN.
- WHATEVER.

35:25.550 --> 35:28.519
- WHY DON'T WE GO HOME, AND
SPEND A QUIET NIGHT TOGETHER?

35:28.560 --> 35:29.686
JUST THE THREE OF US.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.382
- GREAT.

35:32.430 --> 35:33.681
- GOOD.

35:33.730 --> 35:35.220
- ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, GRACIAS.

35:35.260 --> 35:37.524
- WOW. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU SPOKE PORTUGUESE.

35:37.560 --> 35:40.529
- IT'S THE POLICE IN SAN CARLOS.
IT'S LLOYD.

35:40.570 --> 35:41.889
- OH, MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?
DID HIS PLANE CRASH?

35:41.940 --> 35:43.931
- HE DIDN'T MAKE IT
ONTO THE PLANE.

35:43.970 --> 35:45.528
HE STOLE THE ENGRAVING PLATES
FROM THE COPS AND DISAPPEARED.

35:45.570 --> 35:46.867
- I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT HE LIED TO ME.

35:46.910 --> 35:48.901
- HE LIED TO ALL OF US.

35:48.940 --> 35:50.669
- HE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE
AND TOLD ME THAT HE HAD CHANGED.

35:50.710 --> 35:52.348
WHAT KIND OF A MAN DOES THAT?
- WHOA, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

35:52.380 --> 35:54.371
LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS
FOR A SECOND.

35:54.420 --> 35:57.639
LLOYD'S A FREE MAN, RIGHT?
HE CHEATS DEBT,

35:57.680 --> 35:59.511
SO HE TURNS AROUND AND STEALS
EVIDENCE FROM THE POLICE?

35:59.550 --> 36:01.484
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

36:01.520 --> 36:06.321
HELL, EVEN FRANK WOULDN'T DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

36:11.300 --> 36:15.498
THE SHOOTER AT THE MAILBOX PLACE
WORKED FOR LAMAS.

36:15.540 --> 36:18.429
MAN! THAT MEANS MEXICAN
LASSITER'S CORRUPT.

36:18.470 --> 36:19.835
- MEXICAN ME?

36:19.870 --> 36:21.576
THE HELL ARE YOU BLABBERING
ABOUT, SPENCER?

36:21.610 --> 36:22.975
- CALL THE AIRPORT.
TELL 'EM TO GET A PLANE READY.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.739
- WHAT?

36:24.780 --> 36:26.247
- DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO.
- LLOYD'S BEING FRAMED!

36:26.280 --> 36:28.817
WE'RE GOING
BACK TO OLD MEXICO!

36:28.850 --> 36:31.284
DUDE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME.
- YES, I DO.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.582
- MAN, YOU HAVE
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

36:32.620 --> 36:33.939
- I KNOW.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.787
- TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW,
MR. SPENCER.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.890
- LAMAS HAS BEEN LOOKING
FOR THE PLATES THE WHOLE TIME.

36:42.930 --> 36:44.568
HE SENT HIS DEPUTIES
TO SANTA BARBARA

36:44.600 --> 36:46.488
TO INTERCEPT THEM
FROM LLOYD.

36:46.530 --> 36:50.296
BUT WHAT LAMAS DIDN'T KNOW
WAS THAT PABLO ALREADY HAD THEM.

36:50.340 --> 36:51.932
- AND THANKS TO US,
LAMAS ENDED UP WITH--

36:51.970 --> 36:53.801
- LAMAS.
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID, SHAWN.

36:53.840 --> 36:54.909
LAMAS--
- LAMAS.

36:54.940 --> 36:55.907
- WILL YOU STOP IT?
- FOCUS.

36:55.940 --> 36:57.931
- LAMAS ENDED UP WITH THEM.

36:57.980 --> 37:02.019
- BUT HE STILL NEEDED A PATSY TO
PIN THE THEFT OF THE PLATES ON.

37:02.050 --> 37:03.517
- AND WHO BETTER THAN LLOYD?

37:03.550 --> 37:05.017
A US. CITIZEN
WITH A GAMBLING PROBLEM.

37:05.050 --> 37:06.847
- WE'VE BEEN
INVESTIGATING LAMAS FOR CRIMES

37:06.890 --> 37:08.949
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER--
ROBBERY, EXTORTION, AND MURDER.

37:08.990 --> 37:10.480
HE'S A RUTHLESS KILLER.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.851
IT'S BEEN TWO HOURS
SINCE WE GOT

37:11.890 --> 37:13.528
THE CALL THAT LLOYD
STOLE THE PLATES.

37:13.560 --> 37:14.857
YOU NEED TO PREPARE YOURSELF
THAT YOUR STEPFATH ER

37:14.900 --> 37:16.322
MAY ALREADY BE DEAD.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.827
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

37:17.860 --> 37:20.727
LLOYD HAS A WAY
OF GETTING OUT OF TIGHT PLACES.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.809
- [sighs]

37:27.840 --> 37:30.934
COULD I ASK YOU GUYS
A QUESTION?

37:30.980 --> 37:32.277
ARE YOU TWO GUYS
HAPPY IN YOUR WORK?

37:32.310 --> 37:33.800
I MEAN, IS THIS--

37:33.850 --> 37:36.375
IS THIS WHERE YOU THOUGHT
YOU'D BE TWO YEARS AGO?

37:36.420 --> 37:38.012
YOU KNOW, SAME OLD RUT,

37:38.050 --> 37:40.883
AND MAKING PEOPLE
DIG THEIR OWN GRAVES,

37:40.920 --> 37:42.979
AND THEN SHOOTING THEM?

37:43.020 --> 37:45.818
I MEAN, I'M SURE LAMAS HAS
PROMISED YOU SOME OF THAT MONEY

37:45.860 --> 37:47.987
HE'S GONNA PRINT
WITH THE ENGRAVING PLATES.

37:48.030 --> 37:50.351
OH, COME ON, GUYS.

37:50.400 --> 37:53.028
I MEAN, LOOK WHO'S OUT HERE
DOING THE DIRTY WORK.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.959
YOU TWO DESERVE YOUR FAIR SHARE.
AM I WRONG HERE?

38:07.380 --> 38:10.440
- I SEE LLOYD.
HE'S ALIVE.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.744
- HERE.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.383
OH, NO.

38:20.430 --> 38:22.022
[gunshot]

38:23.930 --> 38:25.795
[gunfire]

38:25.830 --> 38:28.060
- [shouts in Spanish]
- THERE THEY GO!

38:28.100 --> 38:29.897
- STAY INSIDE!
GO, GO, GO!

38:29.940 --> 38:31.567
THROUGH HERE.

38:31.610 --> 38:34.977
[chatter on police radio]

38:35.010 --> 38:37.001
- OH, NO.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.848
AW, DAMN YOU, LLOYD.

38:46.520 --> 38:51.355
EVEN THOUGH YOU PUT ME
THROUGH HELL THE LAST TWO DAYS,

38:51.390 --> 38:54.848
THEY WERE SOME OF THE BEST
I'VE HAD IN YEARS.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.492
I FELT ALIVE.

38:56.530 --> 38:57.929
- [sobbing]

38:57.960 --> 38:59.359
- IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME
TO MAKE FRIENDS,

38:59.400 --> 39:02.039
BUT THAT'S
WHAT YOU WERE TO ME.

39:02.070 --> 39:04.664
- [whining]
- A FRIEND.

39:04.710 --> 39:08.032
A DAMN GOOD ONE.

39:08.070 --> 39:10.834
GONNA MISS YOU, BUDDY.

39:10.880 --> 39:14.748
- UH, LLOYD?

39:14.780 --> 39:16.668
- YEAH, SHAWN?

39:16.720 --> 39:18.642
- [gaSPSJ
- WHAT THE HELL--

39:18.690 --> 39:21.909
- WHAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT ME,
I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.450
- UH--YOU--I...

39:23.490 --> 39:24.889
WHAT IS THAT?

39:24.930 --> 39:27.023
A BULLETPROOF VEST?
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THAT ON?

39:27.060 --> 39:28.493
- OH, THIS? OH, I'VE HAD THIS
THE WHOLE TIME.

39:28.530 --> 39:30.498
YOU DON'T THINK
I WOULD COME DOWN

39:30.530 --> 39:32.919
TO SUCH A DANGEROUS PLACE
WITHOUT PROTECTION, DO YOU?

39:32.970 --> 39:34.733
- I DID.

39:34.770 --> 39:36.590
- IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER,
I WAS GONNA PICK YOU UP ONE,

39:36.640 --> 39:39.803
BUT I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW YOUR SIZE.

39:39.840 --> 39:41.979
- ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE.

39:42.010 --> 39:43.136
- I THOUGHT ABOUT
GIVING YOU MINE, BUT I--

39:43.180 --> 39:44.738
WELL, I FIGURED YOU'D BE OKAY.

39:44.780 --> 39:47.806
- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY
UNBELIEVABLE.

39:47.850 --> 39:50.410
- HEY. HEY, EXCUSE ME.

39:50.450 --> 39:52.987
YOU TOOK A SHOT AT POINT BLANK.
YOU RECOVERED.

39:53.020 --> 39:56.456
I DON'T HAVE
YOUR HEALING POWERS!

39:56.490 --> 39:59.618
ARE YOU MAD?

39:59.660 --> 40:01.958
[shouts]
ARE YOU MAD?

40:02.000 --> 40:05.868
ARE YOU?

40:05.900 --> 40:07.925
SENSITIVE GUY, EH?

40:14.580 --> 40:18.801
- I'M JUST GLAD THIS WHOLE THING
IS OVER, AND YOU'RE OKAY.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.000
- I NEED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

40:21.050 --> 40:23.439
I HAVEN'T BEEN
COMPLETELY HONEST.

40:23.480 --> 40:25.539
THE TRUTH IS,
I WAS PRETTY FREAKED OUT

40:25.590 --> 40:28.013
ABOUT THIS WHOLE
INSTANT FAMILY THING.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.814
- OH, GUS--
- LET ME FINISH.

40:30.860 --> 40:33.021
I WASN'T READY TO BE A FATHER.

40:33.060 --> 40:35.927
I WAS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT BE
A COLOSSAL FAILURE.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.690
BUT AFTER WATCHING HENRY AND
LLOYD OVER THESE PAST FEW DAYS,

40:38.730 --> 40:41.198
AND SEEING HOW WELL
SHAWN AND JULIET--

40:41.230 --> 40:43.790
WELL, JULIET TURNED OUT,

40:43.840 --> 40:45.808
IN SPITE OF WHO RAISED HER,

40:45.840 --> 40:48.832
I REALIZED THERE'S
A HUGE MARGIN FOR ERROR.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.907
WHAT I'M SAYING
IS I'M FULLY ONBOARD NOW.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.508
I'M READY TO GET UP IN THERE.

40:54.550 --> 40:55.949
LET'S DO THIS.

40:55.980 --> 40:57.948
- WHOA, GUS, SLOW DOWN.

40:57.980 --> 40:59.982
MAXIMUS ISN'T EVEN CLOSE TO
BEING READY

41:00.020 --> 41:00.884
FOR YOU TO BE HIS DAD.

41:00.920 --> 41:03.013
AS FAR AS HE'S CONCERNED,

41:03.060 --> 41:05.722
YOU'RE JUST A FRIEND BUILDING
A SHELVING UNIT IN MY HOUSE.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.923
- REALLY?

41:08.960 --> 41:11.019
- YEAH.

41:14.100 --> 41:17.638
WAIT A SECOND.

41:17.670 --> 41:19.206
DOES THAT MEAN I REALLY HAVE TO
BUILD THAT SHELVING UNIT?

41:19.240 --> 41:20.764
- YEAH.
- OH...

41:20.810 --> 41:24.598
- AND CLEAN OUT THE GARAGE.
- MAN!

41:27.110 --> 41:29.510
- OKAY, SHOWER CADDY
FROM MCNAB, KEEP OR RETURN?

41:29.550 --> 41:32.018
- WELL, WE COULD
USE IT TO STORE

41:32.050 --> 41:33.847
THE HIS AND HERS
EXFOLIATING BATH GLOVES

41:33.890 --> 41:36.188
IN PINK AND BABY BLUE
THAT GUS GAVE US.

41:36.220 --> 41:38.017
I SAY KEEP.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.880
YOU SAID ANYTHING TO YOUR MOM
ABOUT ALL THE STUFF

41:39.930 --> 41:41.750
THAT WENT DOWN IN MEXICO?

41:41.800 --> 41:44.769
- I THINK LLOYD MEANT IT WHEN
HE SAID HE REALLY LOVES HER.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.097
JUST GONNA KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT.

41:46.130 --> 41:47.563
FOR NOW.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.636
- YOU KNOW,
IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING,

41:49.670 --> 41:52.002
I STILL THINK
IT WOULD'VE BEEN COOL

41:52.040 --> 41:54.770
IF MY DAD AND LLOYD
HAD BECOME BFFs.

41:54.810 --> 41:57.870
- AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN.
- YEAH. NATURE WINS AGAIN.

41:57.910 --> 42:02.017
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

42:02.050 --> 42:03.972
BUT I'M GLAD WE'RE GONNA BE
FAMILY ONE DAY, LLOYD.

42:04.020 --> 42:08.810
- OH, WHAT A NICE--
I FEEL THE SAME WAY, HENRY.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.782
IS THIS A BULLETPROOF VEST?

42:10.820 --> 42:12.959
- YOU THINK I'D EVER HANG OUT
WITH YOU AGAIN WITHOUT ONE?

42:12.990 --> 42:15.129
- HEH. THAT'S GOOD THINKING.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.799
WHICH REMINDS ME,
I HAVE ONE SMALL FAVOR TO ASK--

42:17.830 --> 42:19.024
- LLOYD.

42:19.070 --> 42:22.335
- COULD YOU PASS ME
A COKE ZERO?

42:22.370 --> 42:24.964
THANK YOU.

42:25.010 --> 42:27.137
WHICH REMINDS ME, HENRY, UM,

42:27.170 --> 42:28.706
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TO A COCK FIGHT?

42:28.740 --> 42:29.934
I KNOW THIS GUY
DOWN IN ENCINATA--

42:29.980 --> 42:32.540
- LLOYD.
- OKAY.
