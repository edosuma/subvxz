WEBVTT

00:04.904 --> 00:08.032
Man, I never noticed
what a beautiful smile you have.

00:08.074 --> 00:09.598
- Thank you.
- That's probably just 'cause

00:09.642 --> 00:12.509
I'm mostly focused
on how small your cans are.

00:12.545 --> 00:16.072
Okay, this is why I don't like
you talking during foreplay.

00:16.116 --> 00:17.947
I didn't know
we were about to get nasty.

00:17.984 --> 00:21.112
Why do you think none of my horses
are watching?

00:22.055 --> 00:24.285
I truly dig how nuts you are.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.522
Oh, hey, can I borrow your laptop

00:27.560 --> 00:29.687
to do those endocrine system slides
for our study group?

00:29.729 --> 00:31.788
- What's wrong with yours?
- It's super-slow right now

00:31.831 --> 00:34.299
'cause I'm downloading
every Golden Girls episode.

00:34.334 --> 00:37.792
Man, those old chicks are insane.
All right, there was this one episode...

00:37.837 --> 00:40.863
While I was pretending to listen,
I thought about how

00:40.907 --> 00:43.307
everyone at the hospital
seems to be coupling up.

00:43.343 --> 00:44.469
There was Drew and Denise.

00:44.511 --> 00:46.706
They were still
in their puppy-love stage.

00:46.746 --> 00:49.214
Drew, if I wanted to be
with a girl, I could.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.910
Save all the emotional crap
for your diary.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.817
Then there was
our dysfunctional mom and dad.

00:53.853 --> 00:55.787
- How you holding up?
- Fine.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.380
- You?
- All good.

00:57.590 --> 01:00.115
There's no way in hell you're beating
me at Hands on a Coma Patient.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.924
- So, take your hands off. Quit.
- I don't quit.

01:02.962 --> 01:04.657
I don't quit more.

01:06.332 --> 01:08.425
Oh, no, it's his grandson.

01:10.603 --> 01:16.769
- What are you doing to my grandpa?
- Nice try. That's Dr. Etten's kid.

01:17.010 --> 01:20.878
Hey, you. Next time try dialing down
the acting a notch. Less is more.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.850
Go on. Get out of here. Fake grandson?
That is some weak sauce.

01:24.884 --> 01:27.819
Let me show you how the big boys play.
Todd.

01:31.658 --> 01:34.126
- What the hell, Todd?
- Well, I had no choice.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.094
He found a picture
of Adult Braces Todd.

01:36.129 --> 01:39.189
I can't let that get out there.
Rock-and-a-hard-place-five.

01:39.232 --> 01:42.099
And the winning streak continues!
Yes, sir!

01:42.602 --> 01:44.263
Thank you for your help, Mr. Sawyer.

01:44.304 --> 01:47.102
As a token of my appreciation,
I'm gonna come back later

01:47.140 --> 01:48.664
and smother you with a pillow.

01:49.375 --> 01:50.569
Listen up, losers.

01:50.610 --> 01:54.068
I'm tired of repeating the same
procedure to you guys over and over.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.083
I want two sugars, one cream,
and only a splash,

01:57.117 --> 02:01.281
and I mean a splash, of hazelnut, okay?
Now get out of here.

02:04.557 --> 02:05.649
You are a wonderful teacher.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.091
- I'm getting better, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.424
Sorry we's late.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.453
Well, not we. We are not a we.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.932
I mean, I know, yes,
we're both late, but we're not, like,

02:13.967 --> 02:17.300
coming from the same place
or anything, right, Cole?

02:17.403 --> 02:19.530
I'm gonna go crush a scone.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.499
She told me you two
were sleeping together.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.476
Denise, that was girl talk.

02:24.511 --> 02:27.537
You have broken a sacred bond
between sisters.

02:27.647 --> 02:31.174
Oh, no. Now I'm not gonna get
to wear the Traveling Pants this week.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.514
Look, I know that you've got

02:32.552 --> 02:36.921
daddy-slash-food-slash-body-slash-
confidence-slash-horse issues,

02:37.123 --> 02:38.818
but Cole? Really?

02:39.058 --> 02:42.653
He's only a booty call. I just...
I can't stop.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.223
It's like having a scab you know
you're not supposed to pick at,

02:46.266 --> 02:48.564
but you just can't help it,
'cause you have to know

02:48.601 --> 02:51.229
what's under that pus-y, filled mess.

02:51.271 --> 02:53.432
Call me crazy,
but I think you kids might just make it.

02:53.473 --> 02:54.497
You think?

02:54.541 --> 02:55.803
- No.
- No.

02:57.577 --> 02:58.908
- That was fun.
- Torturing her?

02:58.945 --> 03:02.506
Yeah. We should do more things
like that, you know, as a couple.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.219
Yeah, this makes sense.

03:10.089 --> 03:12.057
I know I do not see you in my cart.

03:12.091 --> 03:14.582
Oh, your cart was in the way,
so she was just gonna move it for you.

03:14.627 --> 03:17.824
You can't just touch
a man's work equipment all willy-nilly.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.695
Do you see me trying
to perform a tracheotomy

03:19.732 --> 03:22.599
just because I did security
for the TV show ER?

03:22.635 --> 03:25.729
He and Eriq La Salle
still go to the same church.

03:25.772 --> 03:27.672
You know,
the last guy who mouthed off to me

03:27.707 --> 03:29.504
has to permanently sit down
when he urinates.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.976
Joke's on you. I do that already.

03:32.545 --> 03:36.106
Bottom line, touch the cart again
and you're going down.

03:37.417 --> 03:40.079
Don't know who she thinks she is.
It's the Captain's cart.

03:40.119 --> 03:43.577
- This could be fun.
- Yeah. I'm happy for us.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.451
Now then, students,
our next patient is suffering

03:46.492 --> 03:51.486
from a horrible disease
known as Being-Dr. -Cox's-Bitch-itis.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.626
You may ask yourself,
how does one catch such a disease?

03:55.802 --> 03:59.863
Well, you do so by losing a bet again
and again and again and again.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.533
And again and again,

04:01.574 --> 04:05.203
until eventually the disease
renders you helpless

04:05.245 --> 04:07.679
to say only the following phrase.

04:10.183 --> 04:12.413
Dr. Coxy's hella foxy.

04:14.420 --> 04:18.254
When I play, I play for keeps.
Bank on it.

04:19.826 --> 04:22.055
Our presentation is at 7:00 a.m.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.121
Cole's supposed to do all the slides.
Lucy, where the hell is he?

04:25.164 --> 04:26.927
Why are you asking me?

04:26.966 --> 04:29.901
Maybe he's napping,
maybe he's training to be a pastry chef.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.597
I don't know what his dreams are, Drew.

04:31.638 --> 04:33.299
This is why I skipped junior high.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.330
I'm sick of Cole.
He's always running late.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.105
And I'm tired of him asking me
to hook him up with Russell Crowe.

04:38.144 --> 04:40.237
Yeah, and he's always making light
of my family

04:40.280 --> 04:41.713
for coming to this country on a boat.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.376
Trang, your dad owns, like,
eight Hometown Buffets. Get over it.

04:44.417 --> 04:49.184
- What up, nerds?
- Cole, did you bring the slides?

04:49.656 --> 04:51.419
Oh, snap. No, no. Look.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.584
I was just about to start,
then my boy Boots called

04:53.626 --> 04:58.120
and he was all like, "Yo, Cole,
it's Boots. Let's go to SeaWorld."

05:01.267 --> 05:03.792
Dudes, I got to swim with a walrus!

05:04.270 --> 05:06.636
You know what, Cole? That's it.
You're out of study group.

05:06.673 --> 05:10.131
What? Hey, are they actually
pissed about this?

05:12.812 --> 05:14.074
Whoa!

05:16.000 --> 05:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:28.661 --> 05:30.561
Even though Cole had been
kicked out of the study group,

05:30.596 --> 05:32.393
he seemed to be doing okay.

05:32.432 --> 05:35.458
Too much work. And I might have
to study on the weekend.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.729
That ain't right.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.432
Hey, ballpark peanuts?
You know something I don't know?

05:41.474 --> 05:44.068
I know a minimum of nine million things
you don't know.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.476
Number 63, Art's back.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.340
- Who's Art?
- Who's Art?

05:49.482 --> 05:51.040
This is Art.

05:53.886 --> 05:55.285
Hiya.

05:55.321 --> 05:58.449
Art's been slinging peanuts
at the ballpark for 40 years.

05:58.491 --> 06:02.222
He is a concessionary legend.
You should all bow down.

06:03.329 --> 06:05.854
I'm serious. Bow down. Now get out.

06:06.966 --> 06:08.763
All right,
who wants a key to a golf cart?

06:08.801 --> 06:10.962
It's right out front.
All juiced up, ready to go.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.027
You can travel in style,

06:12.071 --> 06:14.062
like an old couple
cruising the sad folks' home.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.905
- Hey, how many keys did you make?
- Mmm, just a couple.

06:16.943 --> 06:20.709
Oh, nice. How did they not see us
stealing their cart?

06:20.980 --> 06:25.815
Frank, that cloud look like a cupcake.
And that one look like a chilidog.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.480
Man, I hate being on a diet.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.951
Look at that one.
It looks like a turkey leg.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.118
- Oh, a big turkey leg.
- And a pie. A lemon pie.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.855
Lemon meringue pie.

06:35.962 --> 06:38.624
I will take a key, thank you very much.

06:38.664 --> 06:40.962
I would never willingly
give you anything

06:41.000 --> 06:43.662
that was not some sort of fatal virus.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.138
Whoa! Did you see that?

06:50.443 --> 06:53.378
I'm starting to get a vibe
that Drew doesn't like me or something.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.847
Oh, no. That's how friends make jokes.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.715
No, trust me,
I'm great at reading people.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.514
Hey, that's why you gotta ask him about
letting me back in the study group.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.614
Or we could let him come to us.

07:04.657 --> 07:08.286
Then we'll be in a position of power.
You know, like, "Your move, Drew."

07:08.327 --> 07:11.125
No, come on, please. He listens to you.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.793
Hey, you're smart and nice
and you smell like the beach.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.160
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Yeah, and not like the kind of beach

07:17.203 --> 07:20.366
with dead fish and homeless dudes
camping and that weird foamy stuff...

07:20.406 --> 07:22.306
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah.

07:25.411 --> 07:29.370
Look at you guys.
Chief of Medicine, Chief of Surgery.

07:29.482 --> 07:32.610
It must be nice
to have risen up with each other, huh?

07:32.652 --> 07:34.745
To work with someone
that's got your back.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.755
- There's not that much of that.
- Well, we get awfully busy

07:36.789 --> 07:38.689
with some of the doctoring
around here.

07:38.724 --> 07:39.816
I tell you what there, Art.

07:39.859 --> 07:42.657
Before we do take a look
at that shoulder,

07:42.695 --> 07:44.925
we've been having just a ton
of good, clean fun

07:44.964 --> 07:50.334
with one thing in particular.
Dr. Turk, do you have anything to add?

07:50.770 --> 07:54.638
I don't think it's particularly appropriate
to discuss this in front of a patient.

07:54.674 --> 07:56.403
Approprio maximus.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.214
Dr. Coxy's hella foxy.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.214
I so am!

08:11.257 --> 08:15.421
I bought a candle to set the mood.
Work with me, it's all they had.

08:18.130 --> 08:21.099
Hey. What did Drew say
about me rejoining the study group?

08:21.133 --> 08:23.124
- He said no.
- Really?

08:23.736 --> 08:26.466
Hey, did you remind him
I'm one-eighteenth American Indian?

08:26.506 --> 08:27.837
- Are you?
- I don't know,

08:27.874 --> 08:31.605
but I always tell people that.
Makes the white man feel guilty.

08:31.644 --> 08:34.272
Damn, this sucks. I'm dying on my own.

08:34.313 --> 08:35.871
Yeah, and I'm sad for you,

08:35.914 --> 08:37.849
but we don't want to let this candle
go to waste.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.943
Oh, babe, I'm not in the mood.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.885
A trick candle?
I mean, who finds these funny?

08:48.928 --> 08:52.864
Do it again. Do it. Yeah.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.367
Once we get the CT back
on Arthur's rotator cuff,

09:00.406 --> 09:02.704
it's gonna show the best way
for me to handle it is surgically.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.210
You would say that,
you slice-happy knife jockey.

09:05.244 --> 09:07.041
Here's actually what's going to happen.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.741
We're going to heal him
through medication and PT.

09:09.782 --> 09:12.046
Right, physical therapy.
The miracle of stretching.

09:12.084 --> 09:14.780
It sure beats cutting Arthur open
like he's a pig at a luau.

09:14.820 --> 09:18.756
- Why do you always have to be right?
- I don't have to. I just am.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.053
Let's handle this like men.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.560
First one to Winston Hall
gets to decide how we treat him.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.723
You're on. And go.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.200
Oh, yeah!

09:35.708 --> 09:37.198
There she is.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.570
You stole our cart.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.479
Now come correct
about what you've done.

09:43.516 --> 09:44.744
Don't make me bring the thunder.

09:44.784 --> 09:47.218
'Cause once it's been brought,
it cannot be unbrought.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.983
Do you think maybe your cart wasn't
stolen? Maybe it just left on its own?

09:50.022 --> 09:52.650
What in the name of Larry Holmes
are you talking about?

09:52.692 --> 09:55.718
We've seen the way you treat that cart.
There are patterns of abuse there.

09:55.761 --> 09:59.197
- Yeah, I mean, the kicking, the insults.
- Skipping maintenance checks.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.960
Don't forget
where your bread's buttered, Frank.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.831
Clearly, the cart is reacting
to an injustice,

10:02.868 --> 10:04.597
trying to correct an imbalance
in the universe.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.696
- Cart-ma.
- That's the stupidest thing

10:06.739 --> 10:08.730
- I've ever heard.
- Is it?

10:10.676 --> 10:11.768
What the hell?

10:11.811 --> 10:15.212
You know, the "check engine" light's
been on since May.

10:15.381 --> 10:16.814
Just saying.

10:19.218 --> 10:20.378
Whoo!

10:25.825 --> 10:29.727
Heads up, geezers! Oh, for God's sake!

10:29.762 --> 10:31.992
- I'm gonna win!
- Oh, no, no, no!

10:34.467 --> 10:36.560
No! No! No!

10:36.769 --> 10:38.703
You know,
it's almost gotten to the point

10:38.738 --> 10:41.263
where I don't enjoy
beating you anymore.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.174
That's not true. I love it. Right, fellas?

10:46.545 --> 10:50.037
Hey, guys, what's up?
You out here scoping the ladies?

10:50.082 --> 10:54.382
I hear Rebecca B. Has sex
with multiple partners. What?

10:55.821 --> 10:57.721
- That's how guys talk, right?
- Not at all.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.885
Actually, we were just talking
about how you told Cole

11:00.926 --> 11:03.690
that I said he couldn't get back
into study group,

11:03.729 --> 11:05.890
but you never asked me that.

11:06.699 --> 11:07.723
- I didn't?
- Nope.

11:07.767 --> 11:11.703
And since the only thing I hate more
than entitled little pukes

11:11.737 --> 11:14.706
who don't pull their own weight
is when people put words in my mouth,

11:14.740 --> 11:18.335
- Cole, you're back in study group.
- Hells yeah, the boys are back.

11:18.377 --> 11:19.571
Mmm.

11:20.746 --> 11:23.874
By punishing her, I punish myself.
Such is life.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.980
What the hell, Luce?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.612
Sometimes there are no words.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.484
We quietly do what we can.

11:35.294 --> 11:39.230
And hopefully no one comes along
and says what we don't want to hear.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.391
Whoa.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.161
- Whose tumor is that?
- Art's.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.097
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

11:53.345 --> 11:56.439
- How're you holding up, Art?
- I've been better.

11:57.049 --> 11:59.916
Dr. Cox tells me
there's a surgical option.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.120
I'm interested in that.

12:04.390 --> 12:09.418
Okay. Okay, just give me a second
to talk to Dr. Cox, all right?

12:10.596 --> 12:12.996
What are you doing?
This surgery is risky for a patient

12:13.032 --> 12:14.795
half Arthur's age, and healthier.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.598
Listen to me.
This could buy him some time.

12:17.636 --> 12:20.969
If we don't do it, he's dead
in six months. It's worth a shot.

12:21.006 --> 12:24.498
It's too risky. I'm right, you're wrong,
and I'm not doing it.

12:24.543 --> 12:28.070
No. I'm right and you're wrong,
and you damn sure are doing it

12:28.114 --> 12:30.514
- because I am your boss.
- You're pulling rank on me?

12:30.549 --> 12:35.145
- I am. Now, if you would please say it.
- No, I'm too pissed off!

12:35.387 --> 12:39.323
- Those aren't the rules.
- Dr. Coxy's hella foxy.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.824
Good effort. Do well in surgery.

12:44.330 --> 12:48.767
Okay, hopefully all that stuff with
Cole and Drew has just blown over

12:48.801 --> 12:51.065
and we can all get back to normal.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.264
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.501
If you want to be in this study group,
you gotta show up on time,

12:56.542 --> 12:59.102
'cause you're letting us all down.
Right, Drew?

12:59.145 --> 13:00.737
Dude, I'm just trying to learn
about mucus.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.908
Can we finally talk about the fact that
you and Cole are sleeping together?

13:03.949 --> 13:06.941
Thank you, T-Bone,
I would love to talk about that.

13:06.986 --> 13:10.114
No, "T-Bone," I don't think study group
is the proper place

13:10.156 --> 13:12.147
to be discussing who slept with who.

13:12.191 --> 13:15.024
Trang slept with me.
Never called me back.

13:15.494 --> 13:16.518
Stuff came up.

13:16.562 --> 13:19.861
Crazy idea. How about we just study
in study group?

13:19.965 --> 13:23.196
No can do.
I gotta take a walk to clear my head,

13:23.235 --> 13:26.796
maybe grab a Fruit Roll-Up,
I don't even know right now.

13:26.839 --> 13:30.070
Drew, why would you tell everyone
about me and Cole?

13:30.109 --> 13:31.770
There has never been anything
in the entire world

13:31.811 --> 13:33.802
I care less about,
except maybe this moment.

13:33.846 --> 13:35.575
- And American Idol.
- Cole told us.

13:35.614 --> 13:37.206
He's been bragging about it
for a month.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.878
- What?
- We are never going to learn anything

13:41.287 --> 13:42.879
about medicine.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.258
You okay? I just got your message.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.453
I'm fine.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.620
You said you were attacked.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.358
Oh, yeah. That was a lie.
Look at these two.

13:52.398 --> 13:55.196
They're totally falling apart,
turning on each other.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.826
Okay, I think it's time
to wrap this operation up.

13:56.869 --> 13:59.736
I need you to go find out
who has the cart.

14:00.039 --> 14:03.202
- You said you were stabbed.
- How come you never get my jokes?

14:03.242 --> 14:07.508
- Now go. Chop-chop.
- You said you were stabbed.

14:09.548 --> 14:12.244
We're losing him.
Art, hang in there, buddy.

14:12.284 --> 14:15.742
Start the neosynephrine drip.
Somebody call Cardiology.

14:24.496 --> 14:27.056
Don't say anything. Please.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.959
I don't think I have to.
You'll beat yourself up.

14:42.514 --> 14:45.278
Damn, girl, you can't just jump
in front of golf carts.

14:45.317 --> 14:48.309
- That's how gardeners die.
- Why are you such an ass?

14:48.354 --> 14:50.879
You think it's so cool
just to brag to everybody

14:50.923 --> 14:54.154
about how you slept with me?
Do you know how embarrassing that is?

14:54.193 --> 14:56.957
Oh, you know what's embarrassing?
That you're ashamed to be with me.

14:56.996 --> 15:00.454
Maybe I am. Cole, you call my butt
nicknames in public.

15:00.499 --> 15:04.162
- What are you talking about?
- Boomtown, Lenny and the Fart Zone.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.171
Plus, you abbreviate everything.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.730
Newsflash, PB&J
is already abbreviated.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.469
You don't need to call it
Peebers and Jazz.

15:10.509 --> 15:11.908
Oh, like you're so great?

15:11.944 --> 15:14.674
Okay, you're wishy-washy,
you're obsessed with horses,

15:14.713 --> 15:17.045
and there's that weird role-play
where you make me pretend I'm black.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.312
Is this coming from Cole or Deshaun?

15:19.351 --> 15:22.912
Both. Look, I know
what people think of me,

15:23.489 --> 15:27.687
and I know I act like an ass sometimes,
but I thought you saw through that.

15:27.726 --> 15:31.025
Okay? And I didn't brag
about sleeping with you to seem cool.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.031
I did it because I'm proud
that a girl like you

15:33.065 --> 15:35.693
would want to be
with someone like me.

15:36.869 --> 15:37.995
Boom!

15:38.037 --> 15:39.504
Out of here.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.502
Yeah, you're done.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.877
- Haven't found your cart yet, huh?
- Nope.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.540
The school assigned us scooters.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.845
I don't have the core muscles
to ride that bitch.

15:51.884 --> 15:55.843
Well, maybe if you just apologize
to the cart, it'll come back.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.981
I'm not apologizing to no cart.

15:58.023 --> 16:01.959
What would it hurt, Captain?
The truth is out there.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.455
Fine, Frank. I'll apologize.

16:06.031 --> 16:11.867
I'm sorry, cart. I'm sorry I scuff you up,
I'm sorry I take you for granted,

16:12.438 --> 16:15.896
but if you come back,
I promise I'll treat you better.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.435
Happy?

16:21.380 --> 16:25.578
Hallelujah! I'm gonna take these.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.582
I feel a lot closer to you.

16:29.621 --> 16:33.921
Me, too, but I need to keep this
messing-with-people vibe going, so...

16:34.860 --> 16:38.125
Hey, annoying girl.
My fault. Too general.

16:38.597 --> 16:42.693
Blondie. Girl blondie.
Why do you look so sad?

16:43.435 --> 16:46.063
- It's this thing with me and Cole.
- Don't tell me, tell Drew.

16:46.105 --> 16:47.970
- He's a great listener.
- Why?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.338
If you saw your face, you'd understand.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.737
Have fun.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.938
Drew, I'm really sorry I lied
about the study group.

16:53.979 --> 16:56.914
It's just this thing with Cole
is messing with my head.

16:56.949 --> 17:00.146
I know he's a tool,
but then how come I feel so horrible?

17:00.185 --> 17:02.153
Because you're a needy,
sad, crazy person

17:02.187 --> 17:03.779
who constantly makes bad decisions?

17:03.822 --> 17:06.586
Just my first thought.
I'm still working out the rest.

17:06.625 --> 17:09.856
Lucy, can I ask you a few questions
about your douchey boyfriend?

17:09.895 --> 17:12.295
Does he ever say sweet stuff to you?

17:13.832 --> 17:17.233
Man, I never noticed
what a beautiful smile you have.

17:18.237 --> 17:21.297
- Yeah, kind of.
- And when you guys hang out, is it fun?

17:21.339 --> 17:22.704
Does he make you laugh?

17:26.412 --> 17:27.470
Maybe.

17:27.512 --> 17:30.971
Think about Cole right now.
How does it make you feel?

17:31.917 --> 17:34.750
- You're smiling.
- Oh, crap.

17:36.088 --> 17:38.921
- I like him.
- Yes, you do. You like him.

17:38.957 --> 17:42.916
- You like him, you crazy white girl.
- But it's Cole.

17:43.529 --> 17:48.228
And as sad as that may be for you,
this hospital is so brutal

17:48.267 --> 17:51.464
that if you actually find someone
that can help you get through it,

17:51.503 --> 17:53.027
you're lucky.

17:53.338 --> 17:57.604
Because here, everyone needs
someone to watch their back.

17:58.544 --> 18:00.171
Right, Dr. Turk?

18:01.146 --> 18:02.943
- Absolutely.
- Right.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.644
- I don't like Cole.
- Yes, you do.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.710
- Damn it.
- I feel for you.

18:18.063 --> 18:21.794
Came to get your licks in, huh? I get it.
I damn sure deserve it.

18:21.834 --> 18:26.134
- You may fire at will.
- Actually, I came to say thank you.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.967
You showed a lot of stones
in making that hard call for Art.

18:29.007 --> 18:32.443
It was the right choice.
I was just scared to take it.

18:32.478 --> 18:36.938
It cost him his life.
We stole six months from that guy.

18:36.982 --> 18:39.143
You and I both know that he would
have spent most of that time

18:39.184 --> 18:41.118
in this hospital, just waiting to die.

18:41.153 --> 18:44.145
You pushed me to give him a chance.
You had my back on this one,

18:44.189 --> 18:48.387
and I want you to know that you can
always count on me to have yours.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.657
I appreciate you saying that.

18:50.729 --> 18:54.688
Now I know exactly what it feels like
to be in a Morgan Freeman movie.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.459
Hey, come here.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.106
To Art.

19:11.550 --> 19:15.008
- Cole, can I talk to you?
- Out in public like this?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.982
Don't be crazy. There's people around.

19:18.924 --> 19:23.327
Excuse me for a second, everybody.
I just have something I want to say.

19:24.763 --> 19:28.221
This is Cole Aaronson,
and yes, he's a bit of a jerk,

19:28.267 --> 19:31.703
and yes, he's probably screwed over
every one of you,

19:31.737 --> 19:36.436
and yes, he loves Dane Cook,
but none of that matters to me.

19:37.276 --> 19:40.541
Because I know it just started out
as a hook-up.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.814
I've realized
that I actually really like him.

19:43.849 --> 19:49.651
And so, if it's cool with him, I'd like
to introduce you all to my boyfriend.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.716
Nice speech. Nobody cares.

19:53.825 --> 19:56.055
Some couples just work,

19:56.094 --> 19:58.528
no matter how odd
a pairing they seem to be.

19:58.897 --> 20:02.128
The common denominator
is being there for each other.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.192
Technically I was right about Arthur,

20:04.236 --> 20:05.863
so I'm gonna need you
to give me what's mine.

20:05.904 --> 20:07.804
- Let me hear it.
- Fine.

20:07.839 --> 20:10.603
But it's just because
I'm a man of honor.

20:10.676 --> 20:14.476
Ladies and gentlemen, toot-toot tootie,

20:17.282 --> 20:18.681
Dr. Turk's a cutie.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.414
Yes, I am.

20:23.989 --> 20:27.390
In the end, you just
can't be afraid to move forward.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.925
You're my number-one shorty, yo.

20:29.995 --> 20:33.590
Yeah, that actually leads perfectly
into what I wanted to talk to you about.

20:33.632 --> 20:37.227
- All ears, boo.
- See, now that we're officially a couple,

20:37.636 --> 20:41.470
we're gonna have to start, well,
changing you. Okay, boo?

20:43.308 --> 20:44.866
Wait, what now?

20:47.779 --> 20:51.408
Man, this is so hard. How am I
supposed to remember all this?

20:51.450 --> 20:53.611
While you're my boyfriend,
please refrain from using

20:53.652 --> 20:56.485
the following words and phrases.
Crushing "it,"

20:56.521 --> 21:00.457
ghostriding the whip,
hunting the big dawg, redonkulous,

21:00.492 --> 21:04.019
wrangle dangle, shtoops,
the donk show, gittin' right,

21:04.062 --> 21:07.190
homeskillet, Broseph, Brosephine
and sexting.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.324
On the serious?

21:08.367 --> 21:11.996
There's another one.
Also, substituting your name for words

21:12.037 --> 21:15.768
that sort of sound like your name.
Stone Cole, Cole War,

21:15.807 --> 21:18.173
Pina Cole-lada...
You know what I'm saying.

21:18.210 --> 21:21.179
Girl, I can't give this all up
Cole turkey!

21:22.381 --> 21:26.078
Why don't we just call it a day
and we'll start fresh in the morning?

21:26.118 --> 21:27.346
Sizzle.
