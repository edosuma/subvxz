00:00.560 --> 00:02.461
<i>Previously on</i> Wynonna Earp.

00:02.497 --> 00:04.530
Seems there's a mole in my
organization, Jim.

00:04.564 --> 00:06.899
And you are gonna help me find it.

00:06.934 --> 00:09.402
Gus is getting an offer to buy the bar.

00:09.437 --> 00:12.004
- Decisions had to be made.
- What's this?

00:12.040 --> 00:15.207
It's freedom! Now you can do
whatever it is you want.

00:15.243 --> 00:18.444
Runaway, or who knows what kind
of trouble this girl got herself into.

00:18.479 --> 00:21.347
- There are lacerations.
- Bite-marks.

00:21.382 --> 00:23.449
From scavengers.

00:23.484 --> 00:25.551
I got a message for Wynonna Earp.

00:25.586 --> 00:28.054
- Bobo bought Shorty's.
- (yelling and cheering)

00:31.292 --> 00:34.360
Where is he? Where's Bobo? Ow!

00:34.395 --> 00:37.897
Hey! "Ow" is code for
"hands off," douche.

00:37.932 --> 00:40.900
- The Heir!
- (clicking)

00:40.935 --> 00:42.935
Lower your guns

00:42.970 --> 00:44.970
or I paint these walls
revenant brown faster

00:45.006 --> 00:46.972
than a bad case of food poisoning.

00:47.008 --> 00:48.774
Bloodbaths are bad for business.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.876
(intense music)

00:54.215 --> 00:56.816
Jock, show these fine women

00:56.851 --> 00:59.985
some hospitality. Girls.

01:00.021 --> 01:01.954
- What'll you have?
- A tall glass

01:01.989 --> 01:04.489
of "you're officially next
on my hell-bound and down list."

01:04.525 --> 01:07.526
- You want some ice with that?
- You stole Gus's bar.

01:07.562 --> 01:09.962
No, I paid what she asked for it.

01:09.997 --> 01:12.765
This is our stuff.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.568
Papers are signed.

01:16.885 --> 01:19.605
It's nice to see that we haven't
lost our favourite bar wench.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.574
Yeah, I quit.

01:21.609 --> 01:23.661
I'm gonna need that T-shirt back.

01:24.445 --> 01:26.278
Want me to help you peel it off?

01:26.314 --> 01:28.447
- (men chuckling)
- Let's go.

01:28.483 --> 01:30.483
Wait.

01:30.518 --> 01:32.818
Now, you come into my business,

01:32.854 --> 01:36.255
draw your weapons and insult me.

01:36.290 --> 01:39.024
I'm gonna need a token of apology.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:52.306 --> 01:54.573
(gasp)

01:57.612 --> 01:59.879
- That was Willa's.
- It's mine now.

02:05.386 --> 02:08.430
I can't wait for you
to shoot him in the face.

02:22.571 --> 02:24.603
Zoning out to Drake?

02:26.541 --> 02:28.641
This "hotline bling"
only features revheads

02:28.676 --> 02:30.008
enjoying watered-down beer.

02:30.033 --> 02:32.178
Please, don't try to be cool.
It's literally the worst.

02:32.213 --> 02:34.713
- You were supposed to wait.
- Are you saying we're in?

02:39.259 --> 02:40.192
(beep)

02:40.279 --> 02:41.872
(Bobo): Those Earp
girls may be bangable,

02:41.897 --> 02:43.222
<i>but they're a boil on my scrotum.</i>

02:43.257 --> 02:46.088
Hey! We're in.

02:47.195 --> 02:50.896
(shaky): I'm out. I'm out.

02:51.623 --> 02:53.065
I got out.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.501
(whispering): I got out.

02:58.472 --> 03:02.007
Well. Some days, the meat
walks right into your lap.

03:02.043 --> 03:04.076
(spitting)

03:07.315 --> 03:08.880
Do you have a phone?

03:10.512 --> 03:13.285
- I need a phone.
- Come on inside, darlin',

03:13.321 --> 03:16.255
sure. You can ring my ding-a-ling.

03:17.139 --> 03:18.490
(spitting)

03:18.526 --> 03:21.460
What's that you got there?

03:21.495 --> 03:23.495
Jesus.

03:23.531 --> 03:25.965
Next gas station's a mile back that way.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.634
Get moving. I mean it, girlie. Git!

03:28.669 --> 03:30.176
Can you just...

03:30.838 --> 03:33.906
tell my Mom that I'm sorry I ran off?

03:34.387 --> 03:35.874
I was so angry

03:36.316 --> 03:38.144
and I was so wrong.

03:38.179 --> 03:40.412
When she comes to collect me,
can you just tell her

03:40.448 --> 03:42.781
- that I love her?
- (growling)

03:46.354 --> 03:48.921
- (snarling)
- Please.

03:48.956 --> 03:51.624
- (screaming)
- Won't be nothing left

03:51.659 --> 03:53.659
- of you to fetch.
- (screaming)

They're talking about Dolls, guys!

04:26.294 --> 04:28.761
They're speculating
that your penis is small!

04:31.265 --> 04:33.599
Going in just the two
of you? Pretty risky.

04:34.291 --> 04:35.634
There was an opening.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.836
And we would've loved some
backup, but you went AWOL.

04:37.872 --> 04:40.272
How long have you known
that Bobo is telekinetic?

04:40.308 --> 04:42.374
So he can move objects
with the power of his mind.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.677
- I got a big shiny gun.
- Yeah, and if he can yank

04:44.712 --> 04:46.845
- a necklace, why not Peacemaker?
- I don't know.

04:46.881 --> 04:49.581
How about we get him alone
and shoot him with Peacemaker,

04:49.617 --> 04:52.351
and then it won't matter?
Send this prick back

04:52.386 --> 04:54.953
to hell, not have him hosting happy hour

04:54.989 --> 04:56.507
at my favourite bar.

04:57.024 --> 04:59.024
Hey. Literally all they're talking about

04:59.060 --> 05:01.126
is how many pints they can chug.

05:01.162 --> 05:03.228
Men are all the same,
even the demonic ones.

05:03.986 --> 05:06.268
Surveillance:
mucho taxing on my bladder.

05:07.413 --> 05:09.034
(door opening)

05:09.349 --> 05:11.103
Alright, look. I'm sorry that I missed

05:11.138 --> 05:13.138
your infiltration of Shorty's, OK?

05:13.836 --> 05:16.742
Nice try. I already clocked
the bruises on your knuckles.

05:18.429 --> 05:19.645
(sighing)

05:19.680 --> 05:22.014
Sorry I didn't tell you about
stupid Bobo's stupid powers.

05:23.597 --> 05:25.184
But we are so close.

05:26.049 --> 05:27.653
OK.

05:27.688 --> 05:29.688
Bobo wanted Constance
Clootie to give him

05:29.724 --> 05:32.291
some way out of the
Ghost River Triangle.

05:32.326 --> 05:35.361
- Some... lead.
- A lead? Like a clue?

05:35.396 --> 05:37.229
Right? Who knows. Anyway,
she didn't give it to him;

05:37.264 --> 05:39.531
or lied about ever having it and now

05:39.567 --> 05:42.568
he's up shit creek.
So what's his new escape plan?

05:42.603 --> 05:45.671
Yeah, why buy Shorty's?
To infiltrate the town?

05:45.706 --> 05:47.906
- To piss us off?
- That can be a bonus feature.

05:47.942 --> 05:50.008
But the bar does
have doors that can lock

05:50.044 --> 05:53.022
and is often filled with human
civilians. Human civilians who...

05:53.057 --> 05:55.247
Who would freak if
their designer overalls

05:55.282 --> 05:58.016
were splattered with
gooey brown demon brain.

06:00.755 --> 06:03.522
Perfect cover. As long as he's
in there, we can't go in hot,

06:03.557 --> 06:06.392
or... boom! Mutually
assured destruction.

06:06.427 --> 06:08.527
- Listen.
- (man): <i> Why we gotta be</i>

06:08.562 --> 06:11.964
<i>so out in the open, boss?</i>
Trailer park, we was protected.

06:11.999 --> 06:14.833
(music playing)

06:14.869 --> 06:16.426
You don't think I'll protect you?

06:16.461 --> 06:20.072
No, Bobo, it's just... the heir.

06:20.107 --> 06:22.107
- Ohh.
- (man speaking Cantonese)

06:22.143 --> 06:24.610
(speaking Cantonese)

06:24.645 --> 06:27.146
She got Whiskey Jim, too.
<i>He ain't been seen in days.</i>

06:27.181 --> 06:29.415
- What's a Whiskey Jim?
- Shh, please. I'm just trying

06:29.450 --> 06:31.018
to listen, OK? Thanks.

06:33.988 --> 06:35.821
He's back! Bobo!

06:35.856 --> 06:37.381
He's back!

06:38.192 --> 06:40.526
Cal, calm your tits. Have a drink.

06:42.863 --> 06:44.548
LOU!

06:45.032 --> 06:48.167
Impossible.

06:48.202 --> 06:50.936
There's no way he would
cross back into my territory.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.772
- We had a deal...
- No, I seen this twinkie.

06:54.528 --> 06:56.308
She bore his mark.

06:56.731 --> 06:58.107
And then she...

06:58.345 --> 07:01.680
And then he... LOU!

07:01.715 --> 07:04.183
Goddammit!

07:04.218 --> 07:06.251
Do me a goddamn favour.

07:07.267 --> 07:08.954
All of you!

07:08.989 --> 07:12.324
Refrain from mentioning that name,

07:12.359 --> 07:15.360
because the next piece
of excrement who utters it

07:16.305 --> 07:17.830
will get the Levi treatment.

07:17.865 --> 07:20.799
Hell's Gate, burning insanity,

07:20.835 --> 07:23.202
the whole nine yards. <i>Comprende?</i>

07:23.237 --> 07:25.304
- (high-pitched ringing)
- What the hell, Cal?

07:25.339 --> 07:27.339
(groaning)

07:27.374 --> 07:29.374
It's this goddamn tin tooth.

07:29.410 --> 07:33.111
It picks up radio frequencies sometimes.

07:33.147 --> 07:35.147
What kind of frequencies?

07:37.084 --> 07:39.218
(grunting)

07:42.756 --> 07:45.257
(high-pitched ringing) Eeny...

07:45.292 --> 07:47.626
meeny...

07:47.661 --> 07:49.862
miny...

07:49.897 --> 07:51.964
(high-pitched ringing)

07:51.999 --> 07:54.166
...hoes.

07:54.201 --> 07:57.035
- What the hell is that?
- Yeah, we're burnt.

08:15.256 --> 08:18.657
Hi. <i>It seems I'm not the
only one with eyes and ears</i>

08:18.692 --> 08:21.693
<i>on Purgatory. Well,
here's a juicy little tidbit</i>

08:21.729 --> 08:24.229
<i>even Deputy Marshal Dolls
may not have heard:</i>

08:24.265 --> 08:26.832
Doc Holliday has been boarding

08:26.867 --> 08:29.401
his 130 year old mustang

08:29.436 --> 08:32.604
in Wynonna Earp's ample paddock.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.841
<i>Makes me think of bringing my
own horse in for a little love.</i>

08:35.876 --> 08:38.210
Giddy up!

08:43.856 --> 08:45.117
(beep)

08:45.152 --> 08:47.619
What... Who is this
Lou guy? Did you hear that?

08:47.655 --> 08:49.888
I have never heard Bobo so unsettled.

08:49.924 --> 08:51.857
Have you? I haven't.

08:51.892 --> 08:54.226
Maybe we can use him,
you know? Track him down?

08:54.261 --> 08:56.428
My enemy's enemy. Perfect.

08:56.463 --> 09:00.032
- Yeah.
- Lou. Lou bird.

09:00.067 --> 09:02.701
Louie Luau. That's what
we should concentrate on.

09:02.736 --> 09:05.103
That is the take-away here. Big time.

09:05.139 --> 09:07.539
Yeah. Bae, don't hurt
yourself. Right, Earp?

09:07.575 --> 09:10.309
I'm gonna find some more
information on this Lou guy.

09:11.213 --> 09:13.111
- You think he's a revenant?
- If he is,

09:13.147 --> 09:16.081
maybe we can make an agreement.
Extra time up here

09:16.116 --> 09:18.450
for some more information
on Bobo Del Rey, alright?

09:20.413 --> 09:22.833
Where are you going now? Again?

09:22.868 --> 09:25.143
- I'm going to go do my thing.
- Your thing?

09:25.178 --> 09:28.894
Earp, please, just don't
get distracted by Doc's horse.

09:28.929 --> 09:31.630
There it is. Hey!

09:33.289 --> 09:35.133
Don't forget your phone.

09:35.817 --> 09:37.502
- Thanks.
- Yep.

09:42.974 --> 09:43.974
Shit.

09:53.754 --> 09:55.687
(Wynonna sighing)

09:57.338 --> 09:58.857
Why are you guys in Nedley's office?

09:58.892 --> 10:01.593
- 'Cause when...
- Yes.

10:02.489 --> 10:03.695
OK, here she blows.

10:03.731 --> 10:04.946
Uh...

10:06.371 --> 10:07.633
Doc and I slept together.

10:07.668 --> 10:10.113
And that's news? Really?

10:11.639 --> 10:13.672
- To you, OK.
- (phone ringing)

10:16.310 --> 10:19.111
Really? We're both grownups.

10:19.146 --> 10:21.427
One of you is a little bit
more grown up, don't you think?

10:21.997 --> 10:23.281
- Little bit.
- Why are you

10:23.317 --> 10:25.884
- telling me this now?
- It's out there. Thanks, Bobo.

10:25.919 --> 10:29.488
- Bobo knows?
- Yes. And Dolls.

10:29.523 --> 10:33.458
Uh-oh. Well, do you love Doc?

10:33.494 --> 10:36.061
It was just sex, Waverly.

10:36.577 --> 10:38.609
- God!
- That's not a no!

10:39.199 --> 10:41.733
(growling)

10:43.671 --> 10:46.304
(whimpering)

10:46.882 --> 10:49.174
Jim. Seems Black Badge

10:49.209 --> 10:51.555
has got themselves a rat.

10:52.075 --> 10:53.275
Bobo, I swear.

10:54.308 --> 10:56.014
I swear I didn't tell them nothing.

10:56.050 --> 10:57.846
I know, Jim.

10:59.765 --> 11:01.286
But you're going to start.

11:09.390 --> 11:11.491
(intense music)

11:23.225 --> 11:25.572
Hey, Mister, want a ride?

11:25.607 --> 11:28.375
Always. Wynonna Earp,

11:29.593 --> 11:32.045
the only woman so bold as to woo a man

11:32.080 --> 11:34.848
- with another woman's car.
- I thought if anyone

11:34.883 --> 11:36.797
should have it, it's you.

11:37.352 --> 11:40.483
And exactly what am I to do with it?

11:41.846 --> 11:43.690
What do you usually do
with your enemy's horse?

11:43.725 --> 11:46.193
Shoot it, ride it, paint it
something other than pink?

11:46.228 --> 11:49.229
Colour is the only thing
this pony has going for it.

11:49.264 --> 11:51.164
Strong, masculine.

11:53.061 --> 11:54.682
Pink's traditionally a girl's colour.

11:55.994 --> 11:58.450
Oh, how history rewrites itself.

11:58.607 --> 12:02.142
Back in my day, girls were all
delicate and dainty in blues.

12:04.017 --> 12:05.603
I think you would be...

12:06.593 --> 12:08.077
very pretty in blue.

12:14.803 --> 12:15.854
Everybody knows.

12:17.146 --> 12:18.254
About us.

12:19.653 --> 12:21.160
The sex.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.454
I remember.

12:28.645 --> 12:29.702
The sex.

12:30.238 --> 12:31.671
Between us. Not that there's

12:31.707 --> 12:32.707
really an "us."

12:37.412 --> 12:40.146
(beeping)

12:41.364 --> 12:42.950
Dolls is on the move.

12:42.985 --> 12:45.819
- Stalking multiple men, are we?
- Where the hell is he going?

12:50.692 --> 12:53.393
♪♪♪

13:05.674 --> 13:08.041
(alarm sounding)

13:13.415 --> 13:15.915
Oh, hey!

13:15.951 --> 13:18.551
- (beep)
- (alarm stops)

13:19.700 --> 13:21.921
- You tracked me?
- Of course not.

13:21.957 --> 13:24.591
I tracked your phone.

13:25.220 --> 13:26.726
All the way to Serial Killers

13:26.762 --> 13:28.108
Paradise, apparently.

13:28.697 --> 13:31.097
- What are you doing here, Dolls?
- My job. Some of which

13:31.133 --> 13:33.633
- you do not get to be privy to.
- So I sleep with Doc

13:33.669 --> 13:35.502
and suddenly I'm on
a need-to-know basis, huh?

13:35.537 --> 13:38.672
- Come on.
- Hey! Listen.

13:38.707 --> 13:42.042
If you're keeping things
from me... important things...

13:44.846 --> 13:47.414
A lot of men have hurt me
lately. Don't be one of them.

13:47.449 --> 13:49.416
Listen to me: no one in there

13:49.451 --> 13:51.284
is going to hurt you. OK?

13:51.924 --> 13:53.103
Promise?

13:54.583 --> 13:57.424
Yeah. Promise.

13:58.946 --> 14:00.199
Good.

14:01.263 --> 14:03.463
(metallic clicking)

14:03.498 --> 14:05.799
Still, like to check it out for myself.

14:08.103 --> 14:11.805
Earp, you're interfering
with government business. Earp!

14:11.840 --> 14:14.507
Earp. Hey! Do not go in there.

14:14.543 --> 14:16.643
Come here. Earp! Earp, hey.

14:16.678 --> 14:19.112
EARP!

14:19.147 --> 14:22.215
Holy elaborate torture shit.

14:27.255 --> 14:29.748
- The Heir.
- Revenant scum.

14:30.359 --> 14:33.059
Should have known.
How long you been here?

14:33.095 --> 14:35.517
Well, it's kinda hard to tell.

14:35.864 --> 14:37.536
Two weeks, maybe.

14:37.571 --> 14:40.734
Time moves different when you're being
held against your will, doesn't it?

14:41.864 --> 14:43.802
What does Dolls want with you?

14:43.839 --> 14:46.940
Just keeps jabbing me with his needles.

14:47.816 --> 14:49.342
Thought he'd drain me dry.

14:50.006 --> 14:51.344
Worst part is...

14:52.416 --> 14:53.780
he never asks me nothing.

14:54.272 --> 14:56.014
He's not much of a talker.

14:56.051 --> 14:58.351
- (clicking)
- Me?

14:58.387 --> 15:02.021
I'm a little more chatty. You're
one of Bobo's key guys, right?

15:02.057 --> 15:04.257
Tell me something:

15:04.608 --> 15:06.659
- who's Lou?
- (door shutting)

15:06.695 --> 15:10.196
(heavy breathing)

15:10.232 --> 15:12.265
Well? Answer the woman.

15:13.099 --> 15:14.768
- Answer her.
- Yeah, Lou.

15:14.803 --> 15:17.771
So, Bobo's ex-boy-toy? Frenemy?

15:17.806 --> 15:19.773
- What?
- More like archenemy.

15:19.808 --> 15:22.673
Nobody tries to overthrow
Bobo and lives to tell.

15:22.708 --> 15:25.712
Unless Lou's a serious badass
and Bobo is scared of him.

15:25.747 --> 15:28.882
Bingo. Long time ago...

15:28.917 --> 15:32.252
like, 100 years ago...

15:32.287 --> 15:34.487
Lou and Bobo were thick as thieves.

15:34.523 --> 15:36.598
Now the only thing is,

15:36.633 --> 15:38.599
Lou had a very sadistic streak.

15:38.667 --> 15:41.335
Whereas Bobo subsidized
the town daycare. Go on.

15:41.370 --> 15:45.472
Well, Lou never understood
why revenants needed to hide,

15:45.508 --> 15:48.142
disguise their true nature,

15:48.177 --> 15:50.611
when we could rule.

15:50.646 --> 15:52.946
Make you meat puppets our slaves.

15:52.982 --> 15:54.948
Revenant proud. Got it.

15:54.984 --> 15:57.251
- So Bobo cast him out?
- More like,

15:57.286 --> 15:59.653
Bobo ran away. When Lou left,

15:59.688 --> 16:01.822
he took something so dangerous,

16:01.857 --> 16:03.824
no one would ever
try to cross him again.

16:03.859 --> 16:06.293
- A weapon?
- Something like that.

16:07.094 --> 16:08.195
OK.

16:08.816 --> 16:10.130
Where do we find him?

16:11.152 --> 16:13.667
No one's seen Lou for years.

16:13.702 --> 16:17.102
Heir after heir, he never showed up.

16:18.307 --> 16:20.808
- (sizzling)
- (screaming)

16:20.843 --> 16:23.977
Dammit! He's in the Pine Barrens!

16:24.013 --> 16:27.014
(groaning)

16:27.049 --> 16:29.216
(wheezing)

16:29.251 --> 16:31.885
See, Jimbo. That wasn't so bad. Hmm?

16:34.423 --> 16:36.523
No, no, ah, ah!

16:36.559 --> 16:39.827
(screaming)

16:39.862 --> 16:43.397
Pine Barrens. Beautiful
place, hella bad rep.

16:46.569 --> 16:48.535
Big chemical spill a few years ago

16:48.571 --> 16:51.672
and then rumours that
the trees are haunted,

16:51.707 --> 16:54.007
as many years back as I can remember.

16:54.043 --> 16:56.887
Jimmy-boy gave up Lou's locale
way too quickly. He's lying.

16:56.922 --> 16:59.680
He's terrified. An involuntary
vacay at Club Torment

16:59.715 --> 17:02.116
- will do that to you.
- My BBD superiors need

17:02.151 --> 17:05.118
- a constant stream of samples.
- You kidnapped Whiskey Jim

17:05.154 --> 17:07.454
- to keep feeding the beast?
- And to see how Bobo

17:07.490 --> 17:11.003
and company got a hold of some pretty,
pretty high-level Black Badge intel.

17:12.595 --> 17:14.560
You think we have a mole?

17:15.044 --> 17:18.509
- Do you think it's me?
- Would I have just told you if I did?

17:20.836 --> 17:21.836
(quietly): OK...

17:23.292 --> 17:24.520
God.

17:24.839 --> 17:26.839
This whole time you were
disappearing, I thought...

17:27.500 --> 17:28.564
Thought what?

17:29.311 --> 17:32.179
I thought you were sick. OK?

17:32.214 --> 17:34.815
I thought you were bad sick,
like don't tell your friends

17:34.850 --> 17:37.117
'cause it's gonna scare them
sick. I thought you were sick!

17:37.153 --> 17:39.786
- 'Cause sometimes you get sick.
- OK. Alright!

17:39.822 --> 17:41.364
But you're not, so
I can be pissed at you.

17:41.389 --> 17:43.123
Have at 'er then, geez.

17:43.159 --> 17:46.059
I'm not sick, exactly.

17:46.095 --> 17:48.595
Lou's here, Dolls. Right here.

17:50.030 --> 17:53.015
Torture doesn't result in
actionable intelligence, OK?

17:53.051 --> 17:54.866
Those things are cockroaches to me...

17:54.901 --> 17:57.571
Don't do that. Do not
do that. I saw your eyes

17:57.606 --> 17:59.706
back there. They were cold and callous.

17:59.742 --> 18:01.742
Don't get all hard and
forget that you're human.

18:01.777 --> 18:03.309
That you are you.

18:04.476 --> 18:06.513
- I won't.
- Just remember,

18:06.549 --> 18:09.549
revenants will say anything with a ticket
to Hell pressed to their forehead.

18:11.068 --> 18:12.952
Those the warmest shoes you got?

18:16.625 --> 18:19.393
(intense music)

18:29.805 --> 18:32.272
Hear that? What?

18:32.716 --> 18:35.254
A whole lot of nothing that'll
kill you if you lose focus.

18:35.887 --> 18:36.726
Funny.

18:36.762 --> 18:38.645
I actually have training
in hostile environment

18:38.681 --> 18:42.115
- survival tactics.
- You also grew up in Arizona.

18:42.151 --> 18:44.484
- How'd you know that?
- Most excited I ever saw you

18:44.520 --> 18:46.680
get was when the Cardinals
beat the Cowboys.

18:46.705 --> 18:48.255
That was an amazing goal.

18:48.290 --> 18:50.224
Look, we stay in each
other's sights at all times.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.226
Stay hydrated, but
don't get anything wet.

18:52.261 --> 18:55.258
Watch the UV rays. Killer
when they bounce off snow.

18:57.249 --> 18:58.098
Sylvan dread.

18:58.134 --> 19:00.768
- Who what now?
- Also known as hylophobia.

19:00.803 --> 19:02.752
It's an intense fear of the woods.

19:03.606 --> 19:05.571
Awesome. Let's do this!

19:13.407 --> 19:15.065
(door opening)

19:15.618 --> 19:17.681
(door closing)

19:18.521 --> 19:21.221
(birds chirping)

19:23.926 --> 19:25.408
Where'd you get that?

19:27.255 --> 19:29.496
A vexing present from Wynonna.

19:30.432 --> 19:32.332
You two knocked boots,
now she's giving you gifts?

19:32.368 --> 19:33.511
Please!

19:34.403 --> 19:36.303
A gentleman always removes his boots.

19:36.338 --> 19:38.705
- Ew!
- Your childish attitude

19:38.741 --> 19:41.408
- on the matter is noted.
- It's your attitude

19:41.444 --> 19:43.410
that I'm worried about.

19:43.446 --> 19:45.979
This whole "relationship" is
a train wreck waiting to happen.

19:46.015 --> 19:47.981
I mean, what will the team
do when you two implode?

19:48.017 --> 19:50.017
Wynonna and I are not in
a relationship. Sex alone

19:50.052 --> 19:53.253
- a relationship does not make.
- Again, ew.

19:53.289 --> 19:55.088
I do not kiss and tell,
especially with a lady friend's

19:55.124 --> 19:57.324
little sister. What's important is:

19:57.359 --> 19:59.993
why did she give me a car?

20:00.029 --> 20:01.995
OK, so you're just gonna
smash this thing to bits

20:02.031 --> 20:03.997
- 'cause it feels good?
- Well, unless you've got

20:04.033 --> 20:06.800
- a better suggestion.
- You could learn to drive.

20:08.347 --> 20:09.803
Just an idea.

20:13.987 --> 20:15.509
Indeed.

20:20.616 --> 20:24.117
OK. I think Whiskey Jim
might've been pulling my boob.

20:24.153 --> 20:27.855
(bird cawing)

20:30.993 --> 20:32.926
- Silver dreads?
- Let's just say:

20:32.962 --> 20:36.063
I lost people, once, amongst the trees.

20:36.098 --> 20:37.571
What people?

20:39.285 --> 20:40.868
(birds cawing)

20:40.903 --> 20:44.404
(cacophony of cawing)

20:44.754 --> 20:46.259
What a racket!

20:47.668 --> 20:49.576
What are they singing?

20:49.612 --> 20:51.370
Funeral dirge.

20:53.932 --> 20:55.916
Earp!

20:56.907 --> 20:58.285
(grunt)

20:58.320 --> 21:00.587
- Earp!
- (cracking)

21:01.520 --> 21:02.890
Earp!

21:02.925 --> 21:04.720
- Earp!
- Dolls?

21:05.528 --> 21:07.995
Sun's gonna start heading down.
We should head back.

21:08.582 --> 21:11.398
- It's too soon!
- Dolls?

21:11.433 --> 21:12.830
Wynonna?

21:16.515 --> 21:17.870
Dolls, are you getting this?

21:21.043 --> 21:23.043
- (birds crying)
- Earp,

21:23.078 --> 21:25.579
- if you're messing with me, I...
- Xavier!

21:25.614 --> 21:28.115
(echoing): Xavier! Xavier!

21:30.052 --> 21:33.654
- Wynonna, where are you?
- I'm here, silly.

21:33.689 --> 21:34.926
Look at it.

21:36.125 --> 21:39.259
- (squawking)
- I am!

21:43.332 --> 21:47.067
It's beautiful, Dolls. Come on!

21:57.356 --> 22:00.305
Oh, shit. I'm dead, aren't I?

22:04.339 --> 22:07.398
You have been reborn,
and soon you will meet Yiska.

22:07.434 --> 22:08.795
Cool.

22:09.569 --> 22:13.071
- Anybody got an Advil?
- Who are you?

22:15.208 --> 22:18.476
Courtney. You must be Yiska.

22:18.512 --> 22:21.045
My name is Eve. This is Margo.

22:24.484 --> 22:26.417
I'm the one you seek.

22:27.829 --> 22:29.754
Have you come to us seeking liberation

22:29.789 --> 22:32.857
from the mind control of their
radio waves and phone towers?

22:32.893 --> 22:35.326
Have I! Uh-huh.

22:35.908 --> 22:38.562
You guys were not easy
to find without Google Maps.

22:39.189 --> 22:41.804
So this isn't yours?

22:42.700 --> 22:44.737
An evil I'll be glad to do without.

22:50.383 --> 22:51.884
Yeah. Totally didn't need that.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.353
I sense darkness in you. Deceit.

22:54.389 --> 22:56.355
And usually a pint or two.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.890
You yourself say the light never lies.

22:59.134 --> 23:01.961
- It chose her.
- Yeah, the light! That was...

23:02.870 --> 23:03.995
warm.

23:04.032 --> 23:06.732
You are safe here, amongst your sisters.

23:06.768 --> 23:09.168
'K. What are you?

23:09.204 --> 23:11.237
Those that need to be led

23:11.272 --> 23:14.907
seek me out and I give them guidance.

23:15.455 --> 23:17.610
I don't follow very well.

23:18.342 --> 23:20.179
I'd say I'm more of a fighter.

23:20.455 --> 23:22.849
We have room for those as well.

23:24.166 --> 23:25.818
Your bath is ready.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.014
My... my bath?

23:29.624 --> 23:31.757
(murmuring): What the fudge?

23:33.585 --> 23:34.794
Oh, yeah.

23:39.209 --> 23:41.367
Awesome. Do I just...

23:42.193 --> 23:43.336
Nope?

23:44.167 --> 23:45.770
OK.

23:46.439 --> 23:47.760
Woo!

23:49.191 --> 23:50.943
Spa vibe.

23:53.976 --> 23:56.682
Here I go!

23:59.587 --> 24:01.520
It's hot!

24:01.556 --> 24:04.657
So... relaxing.

24:06.794 --> 24:08.995
(bird shrieking)

24:11.399 --> 24:13.733
Did you burn the rest of my stuff?

24:13.768 --> 24:16.535
Even the stuff that wasn't,
you know, flammable?

24:16.571 --> 24:18.537
Like a thing that
goes around your waist?

24:18.573 --> 24:21.140
- Maybe...
- Guns are the devil's teeth.

24:21.647 --> 24:23.541
Oh, but shiny though, right?

24:23.578 --> 24:25.811
- You mock me.
- No... no, I'm not.

24:25.847 --> 24:28.781
You're right. Guns ruin lives.

24:29.111 --> 24:31.216
(girls whispering)

24:31.252 --> 24:33.219
I only shoot bad guys.

24:33.254 --> 24:36.889
That's the point of... me. Of it.

24:36.925 --> 24:39.091
How can you tell the good from the bad?

24:39.503 --> 24:41.661
Um... the good ones are usually scared.

24:41.696 --> 24:44.120
But they push past the fear,

24:44.993 --> 24:47.465
you know? And they do what's
right, even when it hurts.

24:47.502 --> 24:51.103
Even when every instinct is
telling them to do nothing,

24:52.320 --> 24:53.973
to survive.

24:54.008 --> 24:56.075
And the good ones are hotter.

24:58.313 --> 25:01.197
- (grunting)
- (zapping)

25:01.716 --> 25:04.083
(groaning)

25:04.118 --> 25:07.372
(coughing)

25:07.408 --> 25:09.039
We found him out by the ridge.

25:09.074 --> 25:11.490
Had to zap him three times
before he calmed down.

25:13.541 --> 25:16.862
- We are a peace-loving people.
- Yet holding me hostage

25:16.898 --> 25:19.432
can be interpreted
as an act of terrorism!

25:19.467 --> 25:22.668
(coughing)

25:26.674 --> 25:28.308
Take this upstairs.

25:30.269 --> 25:31.043
Who knew

25:31.079 --> 25:33.512
we would be blessed
with so many visitors today.

25:38.019 --> 25:40.186
(Wynonna): <i>Is Yiska his real name?</i>

25:40.221 --> 25:43.089
Course not. He says there are outsiders

25:43.124 --> 25:46.258
who don't understand our
commune, even fear us.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.289
Fear him.

25:48.429 --> 25:49.522
Do you?

25:53.067 --> 25:55.067
What's Yiska going to do with that man?

25:57.071 --> 25:58.844
He won't last long in the hole.

25:59.913 --> 26:02.174
Sounds less than five-star.

26:02.537 --> 26:05.411
The root cellar, behind the greenhouse.

26:07.882 --> 26:09.393
That's where you'll sleep.

26:09.884 --> 26:11.209
I sleep here.

26:11.886 --> 26:13.919
Don't worry though, I don't snore.

26:14.193 --> 26:17.156
Me neither, unless
there's bourbon involved.

26:21.429 --> 26:23.996
Uh... bedpan?

26:24.032 --> 26:26.432
Unless you want to go search
for the outhouse in the night.

26:26.467 --> 26:27.794
Hard pass.

26:35.410 --> 26:38.878
My first night here,
I sobbed into my pillow.

26:39.489 --> 26:41.180
Soaked it right through.

26:43.151 --> 26:45.117
Jen came and gave me a handkerchief

26:45.153 --> 26:47.420
and some hot chocolate.
She didn't say anything,

26:47.455 --> 26:49.250
she just gave it to me.

26:49.957 --> 26:51.745
It sounds insignificant,

26:52.226 --> 26:53.713
but it made all the difference.

26:54.962 --> 26:57.797
- Where's Jen now?
- Once you are driven away,

26:57.832 --> 26:59.537
there's no coming back.

27:00.968 --> 27:03.402
Did Yiska ever mention
someone named Bobo?

27:03.438 --> 27:05.451
Bobo?

27:07.175 --> 27:09.975
That can't possibly be a real person.

27:12.980 --> 27:15.147
There. You're all set.

27:15.183 --> 27:18.551
I feel a real connection
with you, Courtney.

27:18.586 --> 27:21.449
Yeah, ditto.

27:21.923 --> 27:23.656
(grunting)

27:24.473 --> 27:27.025
(whispering): Sorry!
I hope that was clean!

27:29.397 --> 27:32.098
(wind howling)

27:32.133 --> 27:34.049
(whispering): Hi.

27:35.436 --> 27:38.037
- Brought you a blankie.
- What took you so long?

27:38.072 --> 27:40.606
The mani-pedis here are incredible.

27:40.641 --> 27:42.942
- What happened to you?
- Saw a weird light,

27:43.451 --> 27:45.177
blacked out,

27:45.213 --> 27:47.513
woke up in a creepy chapel.

27:47.548 --> 27:49.782
Yeah, you saw those creepy crows?

27:49.817 --> 27:52.374
Mondays, amiright? Come on!

27:52.399 --> 27:55.321
So, have you got eyes on Lou?

27:55.356 --> 27:57.423
His acolytes call him Yiska.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.558
That's a Navajo name.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.461
Well, what's their word
for "sleazy demon pervert"?

28:02.497 --> 28:04.530
They think he's some kind
of benevolent leader.

28:04.565 --> 28:06.699
Typical brainwashing.
Any word on a weapon

28:06.734 --> 28:08.183
that could scare Bobo?

28:13.341 --> 28:14.454
Bobo.

28:19.247 --> 28:22.014
That narcissist finally figure out

28:22.049 --> 28:24.350
that his stupid
fur coat won't protect him?

28:24.979 --> 28:27.319
Who in the world is this "Bobo"?

28:27.355 --> 28:28.992
A common enemy.

28:31.705 --> 28:33.725
I have no enemies...

28:36.264 --> 28:38.497
...that are in anything...

28:38.533 --> 28:41.000
(low voice): ...but pieces.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.240
(grunting)

28:50.044 --> 28:52.912
So what do you think? Sacrifice?

28:52.947 --> 28:55.181
Or a seriously off-the-hook bat mitzvah.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.117
You have betrayed the peaceful
people of this place.

29:02.290 --> 29:05.658
You are no longer

29:05.693 --> 29:08.227
welcome. Just like you weren't welcome

29:08.262 --> 29:11.397
- back in Purgatory, huh?
- My name is Wynonna Earp.

29:11.432 --> 29:13.766
I come from a long line of Earps
who have been hunting down

29:13.801 --> 29:15.968
the likes of your leader for decades.

29:17.074 --> 29:18.736
The Heir?

29:18.773 --> 29:20.806
Seriously, Yiska, what is going on?

29:20.841 --> 29:24.176
Fate. Irony.

29:24.212 --> 29:27.379
And inevitably, boredom.

29:28.067 --> 29:31.417
Let's get this show on
the road, shall we, Eve?

29:38.793 --> 29:41.260
- (muffled protests)
- May you find safe passage.

29:46.601 --> 29:50.469
- So that's it? We're free to go?
- I wouldn't put it that way.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.893
(intense music)

30:00.646 --> 30:02.680
(grunting)

30:02.715 --> 30:04.782
(tires squealing)

30:09.289 --> 30:11.823
(grunting)

30:12.689 --> 30:14.092
(loud exhale)

30:14.127 --> 30:15.673
Oh, what a night.

30:16.029 --> 30:19.130
(heavy breathing)

30:19.166 --> 30:22.300
Does anybody have a phone? No?

30:22.335 --> 30:24.402
Don't all answer at once.

30:30.677 --> 30:32.844
Eve must have convinced them to
drop me in the middle of town

30:32.879 --> 30:34.913
to look into this.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.417
Voicemail... which
Dolls never listens to

30:39.453 --> 30:41.419
because he says it's antiquated.

30:41.455 --> 30:45.023
Yo, dummy, stop being a dingus

30:45.058 --> 30:47.225
and call me back.

30:47.260 --> 30:49.394
And please be OK, also.

30:53.133 --> 30:55.667
Are you alright there? What's that?

30:55.702 --> 30:57.735
It's like Sharpie. It won't come off.

30:57.771 --> 31:00.138
Find anything?

31:00.173 --> 31:02.440
Every single girl on
this list? Found dead,

31:02.476 --> 31:04.843
scattered around the Ghost
River Triangle. Autopsies say

31:04.878 --> 31:07.712
that they were toyed
with and then killed

31:07.747 --> 31:10.048
by animals that had gone rogue.

31:10.083 --> 31:13.151
- Rabies?
- No. Just... torture.

31:13.960 --> 31:17.416
Like, every single bone
in their body broken,

31:17.451 --> 31:20.136
their skin licked off.
This is why I don't do pets.

31:21.477 --> 31:23.077
Have you seen the last word on the list?

31:23.112 --> 31:25.245
Yeah. "Help."

31:25.281 --> 31:28.182
Eve and the rest of those
girls are still out there.

31:28.217 --> 31:29.828
With lunatic Lou.

31:30.419 --> 31:32.920
Delinquents and runaways.
I mean, it could have

31:32.955 --> 31:35.255
just as easily been me back then,

31:35.291 --> 31:37.651
got sucked into this asshat's scheme.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.361
Whiskey Jim said he has a weapon.

31:41.202 --> 31:43.731
So do you. A big gun.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.433
- I lost it in the Pine Barrens.
- What?!

31:46.469 --> 31:49.937
Along with my partner.
Why is he not back yet?

31:49.972 --> 31:52.050
Maybe they didn't drop him in Purgatory.

31:52.086 --> 31:54.508
Which means he's alone. In the woods.

31:56.110 --> 31:57.110
Which he hates.

31:57.901 --> 31:59.346
Shit!

32:02.318 --> 32:05.686
- Hey.
- OK, so where were we?

32:05.721 --> 32:07.721
Because I seem to think it was
something about, like, candles,

32:07.757 --> 32:10.524
you trying to get me into a sexy
black dress... Something's wrong.

32:10.559 --> 32:13.327
A lot of things might be wrong.

32:13.792 --> 32:16.096
Dolls and Wynonna and her gun...

32:16.132 --> 32:18.632
What is the deal with that gun anyway?

32:18.668 --> 32:20.801
(woman): <i>We have reports
of a pink, four-doored sedan</i>

32:20.836 --> 32:23.604
<i>driving erratically on highway 81.</i>

32:23.639 --> 32:25.906
<i>- Please respond.</i>
- Did she say pink?

32:25.941 --> 32:29.076
Earp! Earp!

32:29.111 --> 32:32.046
Wynonna!

32:32.081 --> 32:35.582
Oh, shit. Oh, come on.

32:35.618 --> 32:37.851
(groaning)

32:37.887 --> 32:40.187
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

32:40.222 --> 32:42.489
- (beeping)
- Yeah!

32:42.525 --> 32:45.492
(heavy breathing)

32:45.528 --> 32:47.728
Here we go. Let's go.

32:47.763 --> 32:50.297
Come on!

32:50.332 --> 32:53.400
One, two, three.

32:55.838 --> 32:58.639
(groaning)

33:00.843 --> 33:02.976
Alright. Stay cool.

33:03.012 --> 33:05.446
- Stay cool.
- (clicking)

33:05.481 --> 33:07.815
Yes. Right.

33:07.850 --> 33:10.384
Freezing my ass off. OK.

33:14.223 --> 33:16.190
Keys, keys, keys, keys.

33:16.225 --> 33:18.981
OK, baby. Gimme. Come on.

33:19.017 --> 33:21.195
- (beeping)
- Go. Oh, come on, come on,

33:21.230 --> 33:23.931
come on, come on, come on, come
on. Come on, heat, let's go.

33:23.966 --> 33:26.633
(snarling)

33:26.669 --> 33:28.836
Oh, damn.

33:28.871 --> 33:30.604
I really hope you're not
as hungry as you look.

33:30.639 --> 33:32.773
- (growling)
- Hey! Alright.

33:34.844 --> 33:37.111
OK! Nice doggie.

33:37.146 --> 33:40.047
Nice doggie.

33:44.186 --> 33:46.954
This... is not good.

33:51.227 --> 33:53.961
- (birds chirping)
- (radio playing quietly)

33:53.996 --> 33:57.064
Hey...

33:57.726 --> 33:59.190
You're doing 140 in a 50 zone.

34:00.343 --> 34:02.236
Licence and registration?

34:02.271 --> 34:04.271
Well, it's me, Officer Haught.

34:04.306 --> 34:06.507
And I have neither of those things.

34:07.646 --> 34:10.373
- Oh, boy.
- How about an explanation, huh?

34:10.409 --> 34:12.790
If there is any kindness
in you, you will arrest me,

34:12.826 --> 34:15.716
and quick. Sorry there, Stone Cold.

34:16.164 --> 34:17.607
Not getting off so easy.

34:23.716 --> 34:26.617
Dolls? DOLLS!

34:27.275 --> 34:29.585
How could you just disappear?
That's impossible.

34:29.621 --> 34:32.856
What am I talking about?
I disappeared. DOLLS!

34:32.891 --> 34:35.391
(shushing)

34:35.428 --> 34:38.762
The wolf will hear us.

34:38.797 --> 34:41.231
You're alive. What wolf?

34:41.266 --> 34:44.134
Sh. Looking for this?

34:44.170 --> 34:47.438
And here I thought you
were just happy to see me.

34:47.473 --> 34:49.773
Oh, I have missed you!

34:49.809 --> 34:52.609
Oh, you're freezing.

34:53.283 --> 34:55.645
- (distant snarling)
- Oh, that wolf.

34:55.681 --> 34:58.382
Oh, yeah. Let's go.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.853
Wrong way, Earp. Where are you going?

35:02.888 --> 35:04.788
- To save the hippie chicks.
- From what?

35:04.824 --> 35:06.924
The weapon!

35:14.891 --> 35:17.591
(chirping)

35:17.627 --> 35:19.322
So where do you think you're going?

35:19.358 --> 35:22.463
I thought I'd visit
my Mama's grave in Valdosta.

35:22.498 --> 35:24.850
- 'Bout time, I reckon.
- Bullshit.

35:24.885 --> 35:26.867
- You're headed northeast.
- I have vanquished my enemy.

35:26.903 --> 35:29.426
I have taken her horse.
I am finished here, Waverly.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.386
- This was your plan the whole time.
- No, this was your plan.

35:32.537 --> 35:35.005
- You told me to learn to drive.
- I didn't mean leave Purgatory

35:35.040 --> 35:36.552
without a word!

35:37.075 --> 35:38.813
I do hate goodbyes.

35:40.341 --> 35:42.166
Look, we need you, OK?

35:43.382 --> 35:44.981
She needs you.

35:47.352 --> 35:49.419
She has Dolls.

35:52.090 --> 35:53.725
Can't you at least try?

35:54.800 --> 35:56.717
I mean, I'm trying with Nicole.

35:58.083 --> 35:59.796
Difference is,

35:59.831 --> 36:01.901
she adores you back.

36:04.303 --> 36:06.202
(engine starting)

36:13.979 --> 36:16.146
♪♪♪

36:21.186 --> 36:23.687
♪♪♪

36:36.099 --> 36:37.067
What are you doing?

36:37.102 --> 36:39.636
The world we worked so hard to create

36:39.671 --> 36:42.472
has been sullied by outsiders.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.374
We must disband.

36:44.409 --> 36:46.138
Become pure.

36:46.611 --> 36:49.062
Then we can begin to rebuild.

36:49.950 --> 36:51.514
You are so great and wise.

36:52.847 --> 36:54.492
Sisters, he's lying...

36:54.528 --> 36:55.883
(gasp)

36:57.532 --> 37:00.332
Always so high and mighty.

37:00.367 --> 37:03.602
Your impurity was poison to us all...

37:04.628 --> 37:06.304
Eve.

37:11.578 --> 37:14.079
(intense music)

37:14.114 --> 37:16.815
The women cast out from the
cult were devoured by an animal!

37:16.850 --> 37:19.451
Of course. The wolf, the crow.

37:19.486 --> 37:21.553
- Get it?
- Not even a little.

37:24.057 --> 37:26.124
Yiska. In Navajo
mythology there are humans

37:26.159 --> 37:28.760
that can take the form
of animals. Skinwalkers.

37:28.795 --> 37:31.329
We're a long way from Navajo territory.

37:31.365 --> 37:33.665
Yeah, but smack in the middle
of the Ghost River Triangle.

37:35.636 --> 37:37.602
It would explain how Lou
managed to protect himself

37:37.638 --> 37:39.409
against Bobo's vengeance.

37:39.973 --> 37:42.307
How did you find this place
again? I had to get freaky

37:42.342 --> 37:44.843
- with a warm light.
- Please. I'm a walking GPS.

37:44.878 --> 37:46.128
I pinged that shit.

37:46.687 --> 37:47.687
Nice.

37:49.216 --> 37:52.951
- (women murmuring)
- You came back.

37:52.986 --> 37:54.557
You watched me take a bath.
That shit bonds for life.

37:54.592 --> 37:56.173
I knew our connection was real.

37:56.209 --> 37:59.190
Totes. You wanna tell me
about this shitty face paint?

37:59.226 --> 38:01.459
They mark all those who are prey.

38:01.495 --> 38:03.695
And Yiska marked us all, before he left.

38:03.730 --> 38:05.897
- What a prince.
- He will rise again

38:05.932 --> 38:07.866
to make us clear once more!

38:07.901 --> 38:09.901
God, you're such a moron.

38:09.936 --> 38:12.470
He cast us out, Margo. He lied to us.

38:12.506 --> 38:14.506
When we leave here, we die.

38:14.541 --> 38:17.075
Hey. I didn't.

38:17.110 --> 38:19.077
- (distant growling)
- (women gasping)

38:19.112 --> 38:21.212
Earp, I think we just
lured the Skinwalker

38:21.248 --> 38:23.248
back to a whole bunch
of free-range dinners.

38:23.283 --> 38:25.417
(distant screaming)

38:25.452 --> 38:27.318
- Hey. Can you find him?
- Cowards always have

38:27.354 --> 38:30.587
an escape route. And sometimes...

38:30.622 --> 38:31.756
a snowmobile.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.858
Earp, go with Eve.

38:33.894 --> 38:36.194
The only way to stop this
Skinwalker is to sever its ties

38:36.229 --> 38:38.797
- with its captor, OK?
- So, kill Lou's revenant ass?

38:38.832 --> 38:41.599
Yeah. Business as usual. Come on.

38:41.635 --> 38:42.635
Alright, ladies.

38:43.603 --> 38:45.870
Up the stairs.
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

38:46.865 --> 38:48.239
This way!

38:48.275 --> 38:50.442
- (Dolls): Now! Come on!
- (women yelling)

38:50.477 --> 38:53.211
(intense music)

38:53.246 --> 38:55.680
Yiska, stop!

38:55.716 --> 38:56.883
Lou!

38:58.452 --> 39:00.552
What are you? A devil?

39:00.587 --> 39:03.888
(low voice): I'm a god!
I have outlived three Heirs.

39:03.924 --> 39:06.558
Bitch here makes it four.

39:06.593 --> 39:09.360
You can't hide from me. Or this.

39:09.396 --> 39:11.396
(laughing)

39:11.431 --> 39:13.691
Who said anything about hiding?

39:14.401 --> 39:17.469
(roaring)

39:17.504 --> 39:21.106
- (screaming)
- Bear! Big bear! Bear!

39:23.310 --> 39:25.195
(groaning)

39:25.220 --> 39:29.614
- Sayonara, bitches.
- Eve, the gun!

39:29.649 --> 39:31.583
- It won't stop the bear!
- Not the bear!

39:31.618 --> 39:35.487
- Just the asshole!
- (engine revving)

39:35.522 --> 39:38.823
AH! Eve! Eve!

39:38.859 --> 39:40.992
(bear roaring)

39:41.027 --> 39:43.361
- (bang)
- (screaming)

39:45.332 --> 39:47.298
(Lou screaming)

39:47.334 --> 39:49.267
Thank you.

39:49.302 --> 39:51.636
(cracking)

39:51.671 --> 39:54.739
(fire roaring)

40:01.047 --> 40:02.981
What the hell was that?

40:03.016 --> 40:05.216
The impossible.

40:10.987 --> 40:12.754
(soft music)

40:14.525 --> 40:16.859
So I found an old photo
in Waverly's research,

40:17.299 --> 40:20.362
of Lou's first wife.
Her name was Tadewi.

40:21.204 --> 40:23.732
She was a horse whisperer of sorts

40:23.767 --> 40:25.701
and there were whispers about her.

40:26.781 --> 40:27.970
Lou was likely using her as a weapon

40:28.005 --> 40:29.972
for over 100 years.

40:30.007 --> 40:32.241
An actual Skinwalker.

40:32.573 --> 40:34.443
Seems like the Ghost River
Triangle is playing host

40:34.478 --> 40:37.145
to a whole realm of
supernatural phenomenon. This...

40:37.852 --> 40:39.532
This is huge.

40:40.751 --> 40:44.286
She didn't remember anything

40:44.321 --> 40:46.450
- since Lou found her, huh?
- Uh-uh.

40:47.558 --> 40:50.559
Yeah. Prolonged psychological trauma

40:50.594 --> 40:52.694
can cause amnesia.

40:52.730 --> 40:54.730
(Dolls sighing)

40:54.765 --> 40:57.399
She may have been brainwashed. Or...

41:00.102 --> 41:03.305
- ...she's lying.
- She's not lying.

41:04.918 --> 41:06.867
We thought she was dead.

41:09.613 --> 41:11.713
- Wynonna...
- We gave up.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.670
- We stopped looking for her.
- Wynonna.

41:17.518 --> 41:19.421
We don't know anything for sure.

41:19.456 --> 41:21.757
There could be 1000 reasons why

41:21.792 --> 41:23.926
Peacemaker worked in
her hand, you hear me?

41:26.163 --> 41:28.130
Or there's one.

41:28.165 --> 41:31.633
♪♪♪

41:36.803 --> 41:38.061
Eve?

41:38.842 --> 41:40.742
Come on.

41:41.326 --> 41:42.711
You're coming home with me.

41:42.746 --> 41:45.747
♪♪ You can't leave me ♪

41:45.783 --> 41:50.252
♪ Without an ending to this story ♪

41:50.287 --> 41:55.318
♪ You can't leave me this way ♪

41:57.494 --> 42:00.362
♪ You can't ♪♪

42:08.409 --> 42:09.838
Hey.

42:09.873 --> 42:13.408
So, listen, you gave Doc a car and...

42:14.188 --> 42:15.244
Well, the thing is that
when you give someone a car...

42:15.279 --> 42:17.179
Not now.

42:18.180 --> 42:19.612
It's alright.

42:20.346 --> 42:22.752
This is one of the
women we helped today.

42:23.395 --> 42:25.387
I said she could crash here for a while.

42:26.605 --> 42:28.158
Waverly, this is...

42:28.193 --> 42:30.359
Would you girls kindly get
your butts in here and...

42:31.710 --> 42:32.718
(bottle shattering)

42:34.183 --> 42:35.297
Willa.

42:35.332 --> 42:37.399
(intense music)
