00:09.501 --> 00:11.138
I'm just, like,
working through a few ideas.

00:11.171 --> 00:13.476
Like, there's this concept of,
like, all the elements,

00:13.509 --> 00:14.444
you know what I mean?

00:14.477 --> 00:16.549

-SYDNEY: And then
I use the remainder

00:25.667 --> 00:27.838
to make like
a play on an XO sauce,

00:27.871 --> 00:30.343

00:30.376 --> 00:31.880

-That doesn't look like
fennel though.

00:31.913 --> 00:33.817
Right, yeah, that's like,
that's what's, like,
cool about it.

00:33.850 --> 00:35.788

about using duck,

of like Wipers

08:26.261 --> 08:28.098
-Aw. Thanks.
-Okay, Sug.

08:28.867 --> 08:31.104
SYDNEY:
Oh, Carm, got two more hires.

08:31.137 --> 08:32.340
-Can I get your eyes on this?
-Yeah.

08:32.373 --> 08:34.077
Hey, if this isn't
happening today,

08:34.110 --> 08:35.614
I really should get going.

08:35.647 --> 08:37.350
This is happening today, Tim.
Right, Fak?

08:37.383 --> 08:39.220
-Yes, it is gonna happen.
-CARMY: Hey.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.057
Okay, these plates?

08:41.090 --> 08:41.993
Uh...

08:42.026 --> 08:43.194
No. Let me see.

08:43.596 --> 08:45.332
I think, um...

08:45.365 --> 08:46.668
This plate.

08:48.305 --> 08:49.708
-Hear that?
-No.

08:49.741 --> 08:50.911
-Right.
-SYDNEY: Okay.

08:50.944 --> 08:51.879
Well, that's 55 bucks a plate

08:51.912 --> 08:52.881
for that type of silence, so...

08:52.914 --> 08:54.017
Okay, yeah.

08:54.050 --> 08:55.319
Then we can use
the shitty ones.

08:55.352 --> 08:56.889
-What's up?
-SUGAR: Slide it in the mailbox.

08:56.922 --> 08:59.127
-This is it?
-Yep, that's it.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.362
Ooh, what's that?

09:00.395 --> 09:01.632
Um, potential plates.

09:01.665 --> 09:02.868
SUGAR:
Oh, that's gorgeous.

09:02.901 --> 09:04.037
That's 55 bucks a plate.

09:04.070 --> 09:04.939
Nope.

09:04.972 --> 09:05.907
Right.

09:05.940 --> 09:06.943
Um, what is that?

09:06.976 --> 09:08.312
Beer and wine permit.

09:08.345 --> 09:10.416
Oh, great.
Doesn't look shady at all.

09:10.449 --> 09:12.119
I think it's
standard procedure
these days.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.123
I'm gonna take this in
and mail it, okay?

09:14.156 --> 09:15.694
-Okay.
-SYDNEY: Um, hey,

09:15.727 --> 09:17.965
when you're back, can we
talk napkins for real, please?

09:17.998 --> 09:19.802
Yes. Yes, we can
go over napkins.

09:19.835 --> 09:20.971
-For real, yes.
-SYDNEY: Okay.

09:21.004 --> 09:23.308
Um, have you heard
of Coach K?

09:23.341 --> 09:25.279
Coach K.
Uh, Duke men's basketball coach.

09:25.312 --> 09:26.347
-SYDNEY: Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:27.216 --> 09:28.318
Um...

09:29.888 --> 09:31.157
Chaos menu.

09:31.792 --> 09:33.361
I just, I don't know. Um...

09:33.830 --> 09:35.867
Let me get back
to you on it, okay?

09:36.467 --> 09:37.704
-Okay.
-SUGAR: Carm.

09:37.737 --> 09:39.307
-Bye!
-CARMY: Yeah.

09:39.340 --> 09:42.380
You're not dropping that off
'cause I'm pregnant, right?

09:42.413 --> 09:44.016
No. No, no, no, I just...

09:44.551 --> 09:46.889
-You've been doing a lot,
and I see that.
-(Sydney sighs)

09:46.922 --> 09:49.961
And, you know, just,
thank you.

09:50.462 --> 09:51.999
Thanks.

09:52.032 --> 09:53.234
Um...

09:54.303 --> 09:56.007
Look, you know
what I wanna say.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.713
I do.
You don't have to say it.
I'm good.

09:58.746 --> 10:00.416
I'm saying stuff
and you're thinking
about electrical.

10:00.449 --> 10:01.719
Okay, good. Thank you.

10:01.752 --> 10:02.854
FAK:
...it's Replacements, right?

10:02.887 --> 10:04.089

we are right now.

10:04.658 --> 10:08.031

kinda like Chingy, you know.

Hey, hey.
I, um, I know we were
supposed to hang out later,

10:27.336 --> 10:30.075
but, um, I-I was wondering

10:30.108 --> 10:31.846
if you might want to

10:31.879 --> 10:34.785
take a drive to Winnetka
with me instead.

10:34.818 --> 10:38.692
("Total Control"
by The Motels playing)

10:47.276 --> 10:48.880
Hey, thank you.
Thank you for, uh, driving.

10:48.913 --> 10:49.982
CLAIRE:
Oh, it's perfect timing.

10:50.015 --> 10:51.318
I had all this extra adrenaline

10:51.351 --> 10:52.821
after resetting
this guy's tibia.

10:52.854 --> 10:53.956
Whoa.

10:55.793 --> 10:57.764
Does that shit
really, like, fire you up?

10:57.797 --> 10:59.935
It fuckin' fires me up.
Plus, I love driving.

10:59.968 --> 11:01.504
-Really?
-CLAIRE: Well, no.

11:01.538 --> 11:03.074
I'm a horrible driver, but...

11:04.043 --> 11:05.312
I enjoy the risk of it.

11:06.181 --> 11:08.318
-I should be worried, then.
-CLAIRE: Yeah, really worried.

11:08.351 --> 11:10.824
I went to med school
in New York, so I never drove,

11:10.857 --> 11:13.195
so I try to make up for it
in the times I'm not working.

11:13.228 --> 11:14.396
CARMY: Gotcha.

11:17.503 --> 11:20.342
So I gotta ask, how, um,
how gnarly is residency?

11:21.044 --> 11:23.414
It's, uh, gnarly
like you cannot imagine.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.356
Right.

11:27.758 --> 11:29.460
Okay, yeah, 'cause
everything I've heard about it,

11:29.493 --> 11:33.235
it sounds like, well,
really fucking gnarly.

11:33.268 --> 11:34.270
Really gross.

11:34.303 --> 11:35.774
And the time commitment, too,

11:35.807 --> 11:38.311
it's like 100 hours on,
two hours off, so...

11:40.917 --> 11:42.854
I don't know,
you must really love it.

11:43.823 --> 11:47.496
You know, especially
considering how gnarly
and gross it is.

11:50.035 --> 11:52.272
Isn't a restaurant 100 hours on
and two hours off?

11:53.876 --> 11:55.212
Sure is.

11:55.245 --> 11:57.416
Isn't a restaurant,
uh, gnarly and gross?

11:58.552 --> 12:00.055

-It's really thrilling.
-CARMY: Hmm.

15:46.307 --> 15:49.046
Um... I also remembered

15:49.079 --> 15:52.352
that I sat behind you
in Algebra freshman year.

15:56.127 --> 15:58.465

drawing something.

what you were drawing.

Um, yeah, pants.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.243
-Really short pants.

-Yeah.
-CARMY: Very, very short pants.

16:05.546 --> 16:08.518

I had this idea for, like,

16:08.552 --> 16:11.090
like Dickies, but cuffed
and made with worsted wool.

16:11.123 --> 16:13.663
-Hmm.
-Done at
a very high level, yeah.

16:13.696 --> 16:15.633
Well, they were
really high-level drawings.

16:15.666 --> 16:18.138
CARMY: Yeah. I, um, I just
didn't realize at the time

16:18.171 --> 16:21.679
that somebody had been making
those pants, uh, very well

16:21.712 --> 16:25.252
for a very long time at a,
at a very high, high level.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.789
Dream killed.

16:26.822 --> 16:29.561
Yeah, but then the, uh,
the guy who made them,

16:29.594 --> 16:30.797
he actually,
he started coming in

16:30.830 --> 16:32.701
in to one of
my restaurants and, um,

16:32.734 --> 16:34.403
and he was really great.

16:34.436 --> 16:36.274
And, uh,
I don't know, I felt like

16:36.307 --> 16:38.278
I wanted to start drawing again.

CLAIRE:
The dream returned.
