00:14.194 --> 00:16.128
No life form
readings, Captain.

00:16.196 --> 00:17.356
Continuing scan.

00:17.431 --> 00:19.865
Well, somebody sent
a distress call.

00:19.933 --> 00:21.867
No sign of
the spaceship.

00:21.935 --> 00:23.368
No sign of debris.

00:25.806 --> 00:27.239
I am
getting readings

00:27.307 --> 00:30.140
on small
metallic objects, Captain.

00:30.210 --> 00:32.644
It's possible the ship was
destroyed in space

00:32.713 --> 00:35.648
and the survivors
proceeded here in a shuttle craft.

00:35.716 --> 00:37.149
But where are they?

00:37.217 --> 00:39.151
Captain, I'm getting
a reading now.

00:39.219 --> 00:43.349
Two human forms
at bearing 300 mark 7.

00:43.423 --> 00:44.685
Confirmed.

01:08.782 --> 01:10.215
I'm Captain
James T. Kirk

01:10.283 --> 01:11.716
of the starship
Enterprise.

01:11.785 --> 01:14.219
We came in answer
to your distress call.

01:14.287 --> 01:17.222
It was very kind of you
to respond so quickly.

01:18.625 --> 01:21.617
Now you will surrender
your ship to me.

01:26.133 --> 01:28.567
You have a very strange
sense of humor, Mr. ...

01:40.881 --> 01:43.406
I am Rojan of Kelva.

01:43.483 --> 01:45.417
I am your commander

01:45.485 --> 01:47.077
from this moment on.

01:50.657 --> 01:52.591
Any efforts
to resist us ...

01:52.659 --> 01:55.059
or to escape ...

01:55.128 --> 01:57.460
will be
severely punished.

01:59.099 --> 02:01.158
Soon we ...

02:01.234 --> 02:02.258
and you ...

02:02.335 --> 02:06.362
will leave
this galaxy forever.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.101
You humans ...

02:08.175 --> 02:13.112
must face the end of your existence
as you have known it.

02:24.157 --> 02:25.089
Space ...

02:25.158 --> 02:26.989
the final frontier.

02:33.233 --> 02:37.226
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:37.304 --> 02:38.862
Its five-year mission --

02:38.939 --> 02:41.305
To explore
strange new worlds,

02:41.374 --> 02:45.105
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:45.178 --> 02:46.702
to boldly go

02:46.780 --> 02:49.180
where no man
has gone before.

03:36.096 --> 03:38.724
You are all paralyzed
by a selective field

03:38.798 --> 03:40.390
that neutralizes
nerve impulses

03:40.467 --> 03:42.059
to the voluntary muscles.

03:42.135 --> 03:44.433
We can control you
at will.

03:45.539 --> 03:46.972
I will now release you.

03:47.040 --> 03:47.972
[Beep]

03:48.041 --> 03:48.973
Captain.

03:49.042 --> 03:50.475
It's all right.

03:50.544 --> 03:51.476
Interesting.

03:51.545 --> 03:52.978
A neural field?

03:53.046 --> 03:55.640
Yes. Radiating
from a central projector.

03:55.715 --> 03:57.148
What do you want?

03:57.217 --> 03:58.479
Your ship,
Captain Kirk.

03:58.552 --> 03:59.985
It will
serve us well

04:00.053 --> 04:01.486
in the long voyage.

04:01.555 --> 04:02.647
Voyage? Where?

04:02.722 --> 04:04.155
To your
neighboring galaxy,

04:04.224 --> 04:06.192
which you call
Andromeda.

04:06.259 --> 04:07.191
Andromeda?

04:07.260 --> 04:08.386
Why?

04:08.461 --> 04:10.156
It is our home.

04:11.598 --> 04:12.895
What brings
you here?

04:12.966 --> 04:14.399
Within 10 millennia,

04:14.467 --> 04:17.435
high radiation levels
in our galaxy

04:17.504 --> 04:18.869
will make life there
impossible.

04:18.939 --> 04:21.874
So the Kelvan Empire
sent forth ships

04:21.942 --> 04:24.001
to explore
other galaxies,

04:24.077 --> 04:25.510
to search for one

04:25.579 --> 04:28.013
which our race
could conquer and occupy.

04:28.081 --> 04:30.276
Well, sorry. This galaxy
is already occupied.

04:30.350 --> 04:34.810
Captain, you think
you are unconquerable

04:34.888 --> 04:36.879
and your ship
impregnable,

04:36.957 --> 04:38.948
but while we've talked,

04:39.025 --> 04:40.993
the capture
has already begun.

04:42.762 --> 04:44.593
Something penetrating
from the planet.

04:44.664 --> 04:46.723
Increase power
to shields.

04:56.710 --> 04:59.144
It's dead, sir.
All major power disabled.

04:59.212 --> 05:00.645
Sound red alert.

05:00.714 --> 05:02.147
Red alert.
All personnel

05:02.215 --> 05:03.580
man your
battle stations.

05:03.650 --> 05:04.947
Go to red alert.

05:12.392 --> 05:13.825
Engineering,
come in.

05:13.893 --> 05:15.326
Life support,
come in.

05:31.811 --> 05:34.143
Drea, Tomar, report.

05:34.214 --> 05:35.943
Life support control,
secure.

05:36.016 --> 05:37.415
Engineering
is secure.

05:37.484 --> 05:38.917
Rojan,
Hanar here.

05:38.985 --> 05:39.917
Report, Hanar.

05:39.986 --> 05:41.419
The ship is ours.

05:41.488 --> 05:42.921
We control the bridge,
engineering,

05:42.989 --> 05:44.422
and life support
systems.

05:44.491 --> 05:45.924
Proceed with
your orders.

05:51.331 --> 05:53.663
What's the point
of capturing my ship?

05:53.733 --> 05:55.166
Even at maximum warp,

05:55.235 --> 05:56.668
the Enterprise
couldn't get to Andromeda

05:56.736 --> 05:57.862
for thousands of years.

05:57.937 --> 06:00.929
Captain, we will
modify its engines

06:01.007 --> 06:02.372
in order to
produce velocities

06:02.442 --> 06:04.967
far beyond the reach
of your science.

06:05.045 --> 06:06.478
The journey
between galaxies

06:06.546 --> 06:10.243
will take less than
300 of your years.

06:10.316 --> 06:12.079
Fascinating.

06:12.152 --> 06:15.246
Intergalactic travel
requiring only 300 years?

06:15.321 --> 06:16.754
That is a leap

06:16.823 --> 06:19.257
far beyond anything
man has yet accomplished.

06:19.325 --> 06:22.920
You made a voyage
of 300 years?

06:24.431 --> 06:27.423
Our ships were of
multigeneration design.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.367
We were born in
the intergalactic void.

06:30.437 --> 06:33.031
We shall die there
during our return journey.

06:33.106 --> 06:34.539
Our mission
will be completed

06:34.607 --> 06:36.040
by my descendant.

06:36.109 --> 06:37.667
What happened
to your ship?

06:37.744 --> 06:39.177
There is
an energy barrier

06:39.245 --> 06:41.179
at the rim
of your galaxy.

06:41.247 --> 06:42.236
I know.

06:42.315 --> 06:44.749
We broke through it
with great difficulty.

06:44.818 --> 06:46.251
Our ship was destroyed.

06:46.319 --> 06:48.253
We barely managed
to escape

06:48.321 --> 06:49.982
in a life craft.

06:50.056 --> 06:50.988
And now ...

06:51.057 --> 06:53.992
we have the means
to begin our journey

06:54.060 --> 06:55.493
back to Andromeda.

06:55.562 --> 06:56.995
Why use our vessel?

06:57.063 --> 06:59.896
Why not transmit a message
to your galaxy?

06:59.966 --> 07:02.560
No form of transmission
can penetrate the barrier.

07:02.635 --> 07:03.567
Rojan,

07:03.636 --> 07:06.571
there's no reason
to do this by force.

07:06.639 --> 07:09.005
Let's take your problem
to the Federation.

07:09.075 --> 07:10.406
Research expeditions

07:10.477 --> 07:14.038
have catalogued hundreds
of uninhabited planets in this galaxy

07:14.114 --> 07:15.741
suitable
for colonization.

07:15.815 --> 07:17.248
We do not colonize.

07:17.317 --> 07:18.875
We conquer.

07:18.952 --> 07:20.317
We rule.

07:21.821 --> 07:23.254
There's no other way.

07:23.323 --> 07:24.756
In other words,

07:24.824 --> 07:27.759
the galaxy isn't big enough
for both of us.

07:27.827 --> 07:30.295
The Federation has handled
foreign invasions before.

07:30.363 --> 07:32.297
We can control
the Federation

07:32.365 --> 07:35.095
as easily as we
can control you.

07:37.237 --> 07:41.003
The fate of the inferior
in any galaxy.

07:43.877 --> 07:46.209
All is proceeding
according to plan, Rojan.

07:46.279 --> 07:49.578
Kelinda, take them
to the holding area.

07:49.649 --> 07:52.277
We'll keep you
and your party here, Captain.

07:52.352 --> 07:55.287
Your crew will undoubtedly
wish to cooperate with us

07:55.355 --> 07:57.755
if they understand
that you are hostages.

07:57.824 --> 07:59.792
[Kelinda]
Move there.

08:10.370 --> 08:12.304
Tomar has examined
the ship.

08:12.372 --> 08:13.930
The modifications
are underway.

08:15.508 --> 08:18.534
Space again, Hanar.

08:18.611 --> 08:22.047
I do not think we could
have kept our sanity

08:22.115 --> 08:24.549
living too long
on this accursed planet.

08:24.617 --> 08:26.050
It is an undisciplined
environment.

08:26.119 --> 08:27.552
One cannot control it.

08:27.620 --> 08:30.885
Yet there are
things of interest.

08:30.957 --> 08:32.618
Yes, but disturbing.

08:34.193 --> 08:36.628
These shells in which
we've encased ourselves,

08:36.696 --> 08:39.096
they have such
heightened senses.

08:39.164 --> 08:40.996
To feel ...

08:41.067 --> 08:41.999
to hear ...

08:42.068 --> 08:43.467
to smell.

08:43.535 --> 08:45.970
How do humans
manage to exist

08:46.039 --> 08:47.472
in these
fragile cases?

08:47.540 --> 08:48.973
Since the ship
was designed

08:49.042 --> 08:50.475
to sustain
these forms,

08:50.543 --> 08:52.010
we have
little choice.

08:53.947 --> 08:57.781
At least we'll be away
from all of this openness.

08:57.851 --> 09:02.049
No, this is too strange
for us, Hanar.

09:02.121 --> 09:04.885
We are creatures
of outer space.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.516
Soon ...

09:06.593 --> 09:08.026
we will be safe

09:08.094 --> 09:10.562
in the comforting
closeness of walls.

09:12.699 --> 09:14.223
Fascinating material.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.234
Similar to dibernium,

09:16.302 --> 09:17.735
but considerably
more dense.

09:17.804 --> 09:19.635
I doubt even
phaser fire

09:19.706 --> 09:21.264
could disturb
its molecular structure.

09:21.341 --> 09:22.638
We can't break out.

09:22.709 --> 09:24.142
There must be
another way.

09:24.210 --> 09:27.145
Captain, what kind
of people are they?

09:27.213 --> 09:28.646
That's a very good
question.

09:28.715 --> 09:30.148
They registered
as human.

09:30.216 --> 09:31.148
No, Doctor.

09:31.217 --> 09:32.650
More than that.

09:32.719 --> 09:35.654
They registered as perfect
human life forms.

09:35.722 --> 09:37.155
I recall noting

09:37.223 --> 09:40.920
the readings were almost
classic textbook responses.

09:40.994 --> 09:41.926
Most curious.

09:41.995 --> 09:43.428
Spock, what
are the odds

09:43.496 --> 09:45.930
in such absolute
duplication of life forms

09:45.999 --> 09:47.432
in another galaxy?

09:47.500 --> 09:50.060
The chances
are very much against it.

09:50.136 --> 09:51.330
Captain, Captain.

09:55.174 --> 09:56.607
However perfect
they are,

09:56.676 --> 09:59.611
there don't seem to be
very many of them.

09:59.679 --> 10:01.613
They have
the paralysis field.

10:01.681 --> 10:04.946
Rojan mentioned
something about a ...

10:05.018 --> 10:07.111
central projector.

10:07.186 --> 10:08.118
Yes.

10:08.187 --> 10:10.621
If we could put that
out of operation,

10:10.690 --> 10:11.952
we might have a chance.

10:12.025 --> 10:13.959
Gentlemen, I'm
constrained to point out

10:14.027 --> 10:15.460
we do not even know

10:15.528 --> 10:16.790
what this projector
looks like.

10:16.863 --> 10:18.296
Those devices on their belts

10:18.364 --> 10:20.229
might indicate the source
of the force field.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.232
Possible.

10:21.301 --> 10:23.132
I would have to have
one to examine.

10:23.202 --> 10:24.635
You'll have one, sir,

10:24.704 --> 10:27.639
if I have to rip
one of them apart --

10:27.707 --> 10:29.140
You'll
get your chance,

10:29.208 --> 10:31.142
- but you'll do it under orders.
- Yes, sir.

10:33.346 --> 10:34.779
On Eminiar VII,

10:34.847 --> 10:37.281
you were able
to trick the guard

10:37.350 --> 10:38.783
by a Vulcan mind probe.

10:38.851 --> 10:41.786
I led him to believe
we had escaped.

10:41.854 --> 10:44.288
Do you think
you can do it again?

10:44.357 --> 10:45.688
I shall attempt it.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.183
You all right?

11:45.251 --> 11:46.741
I will be all right.

11:46.819 --> 11:48.252
We must hurry.

12:04.637 --> 12:06.229
[Beep]

12:06.305 --> 12:08.205
This cannot go
unpunished.

12:09.575 --> 12:10.542
Hanar.

12:14.981 --> 12:15.913
That one.

12:15.982 --> 12:17.813
Take him aside.

12:20.420 --> 12:21.352
Kelinda.

12:21.421 --> 12:22.718
The female.

12:29.262 --> 12:31.355
Captain.

12:31.431 --> 12:32.625
Go.

12:41.774 --> 12:43.207
As a leader,

12:43.276 --> 12:45.267
you realize the importance
of discipline.

12:45.344 --> 12:47.835
I need you and
these other specialists,

12:47.914 --> 12:49.575
but those two
are unnecessary.

12:53.753 --> 12:55.277
I'm responsible.
Let them go.

12:55.354 --> 12:57.288
I think we're
somewhat alike, Captain.

12:57.356 --> 13:00.291
Each of us cares
less for his own safety

13:00.359 --> 13:02.725
than for the lives
of his command.

13:02.795 --> 13:05.764
We feel pain when others
suffer for our mistakes.

13:05.832 --> 13:08.767
Your punishment shall be
to watch them die.

13:08.835 --> 13:10.598
Captain ...

13:12.772 --> 13:14.034
proceed, Hanar.

13:37.463 --> 13:39.158
Bring them to me.

13:49.108 --> 13:52.043
This is the essence
of what they were.

13:52.111 --> 13:54.545
The flesh and brain

13:54.614 --> 13:56.548
and what you call ...

13:56.616 --> 13:58.379
a personality,

13:58.451 --> 14:02.080
distilled down
into these compact shapes.

14:03.723 --> 14:05.714
Once crushed ...

14:17.803 --> 14:19.395
this person is dead.

14:25.244 --> 14:26.438
However ...

14:29.682 --> 14:31.274
that one can be restored.

14:32.518 --> 14:33.883
Hanar.

14:57.743 --> 15:01.406
Captain 's log,
stardate 4657.5.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.176
Work is proceeding
on the Enterprise

15:04.250 --> 15:06.718
as my crew is forced to
make the required changes

15:06.786 --> 15:09.220
in the ship
for intergalactic travel.

15:09.288 --> 15:13.224
I can't forget the picture
of Yeoman Thompson

15:13.292 --> 15:15.726
crushed to
a handful of dust.

15:15.795 --> 15:18.229
Spock, are you sure
you're all right?

15:18.297 --> 15:19.855
Yes, quite all right,
Doctor.

15:19.932 --> 15:21.524
You didn't
look very well

15:21.601 --> 15:23.535
when you broke
that mind touch.

15:23.603 --> 15:25.537
I didn't not
break it, Doctor.

15:25.605 --> 15:27.038
I was thrown away

15:27.106 --> 15:29.131
by something I've never
experienced before.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.641
What was it?

15:32.178 --> 15:37.878
A series of bizarre
and exotic images

15:37.950 --> 15:40.316
bursting on my mind
and consciousness.

15:40.386 --> 15:41.876
Colors ...

15:41.954 --> 15:43.319
shapes ...

15:43.389 --> 15:46.984
mathematical equations
fused and blurred.

15:47.059 --> 15:48.993
I've been attempting
to isolate them,

15:49.061 --> 15:51.495
but I've been able
to recall clearly

15:51.564 --> 15:52.496
only one.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.728
Immense beings ...

15:56.802 --> 16:00.033
100 limbs which
resemble tentacles,

16:00.106 --> 16:02.040
minds of such control
and capacity

16:02.108 --> 16:04.474
that each limb
is capable of performing

16:04.543 --> 16:05.942
a different function.

16:07.647 --> 16:11.083
Do you mean that's what
the Kelvans really are?

16:11.150 --> 16:12.242
Undoubtedly.

16:12.318 --> 16:14.752
Well, if they
look that way normally,

16:14.820 --> 16:16.981
why did they adapt themselves
to our bodies?

16:17.056 --> 16:18.683
Perhaps practicality.

16:18.758 --> 16:20.191
They chose
the Enterprise

16:20.259 --> 16:23.194
as the best vessel
for the trip.

16:23.262 --> 16:26.390
Immense beings
with 100 tentacles

16:26.465 --> 16:28.899
would have difficulty
with the turbo lift.

16:28.968 --> 16:30.902
We've got to stop them.

16:30.970 --> 16:32.403
We outnumber them.

16:32.471 --> 16:35.702
Their only hold on us
is the paralysis field.

16:35.775 --> 16:37.208
That's enough.
One wrong move,

16:37.276 --> 16:39.767
and they jam
all our neural circuits.

16:39.845 --> 16:40.812
Jam.

16:40.880 --> 16:41.812
Spock,

16:41.881 --> 16:43.314
if you reverse
the circuits

16:43.382 --> 16:44.815
on McCoy's
neuro-analyzer,

16:44.884 --> 16:47.318
can you set up
a counter field

16:47.386 --> 16:49.320
to jam the
paralysis projector?

16:49.388 --> 16:50.821
I'm dubious
of success, Captain.

16:50.890 --> 16:52.824
The medical equipment
is not designed

16:52.892 --> 16:54.325
to put out
a great deal of power.

16:54.393 --> 16:56.827
The polarized elements
would burn out quickly.

16:56.896 --> 16:58.386
Is there a chance?

16:58.464 --> 16:59.897
A small one.

16:59.965 --> 17:01.398
We'll take it.

17:01.467 --> 17:03.833
You and Bones
have to get to the ship.

17:03.903 --> 17:04.835
How?

17:04.904 --> 17:05.836
Yes, ho --

17:08.674 --> 17:11.040
Mr. Spock ...

17:12.645 --> 17:13.634
you're sick.

17:13.713 --> 17:17.171
I assure you, Captain,
I'm in perfect health.

17:17.249 --> 17:18.682
No, you're not.

17:18.751 --> 17:21.185
Dr. McCoy has given you
an examination, and you're ill.

17:21.252 --> 17:24.586
If you don't get to the sick bay,
you're gonna die.

17:24.656 --> 17:27.454
It's a good idea,
but anyone looking at him

17:27.526 --> 17:28.959
can tell he's healthy.

17:29.028 --> 17:31.963
Vulcans can
place themselves in a trance,

17:32.031 --> 17:35.797
complete relaxation of every part
of the mind and body.

17:35.868 --> 17:38.302
We find it more
restful to the body

17:38.371 --> 17:39.804
than your
so-called vacation.

17:39.872 --> 17:41.305
Can you do it now

17:41.374 --> 17:44.400
and come out of it
in the sick bay?

17:44.477 --> 17:46.843
It will take me
a moment to prepare.

17:46.912 --> 17:48.004
Go ahead.

18:07.466 --> 18:08.398
Jim ...

18:08.467 --> 18:10.401
his heartbeat
really is slow.

18:10.469 --> 18:13.495
His pulse is
practically nonexistent.

18:14.607 --> 18:16.234
Hanar.

18:16.308 --> 18:17.502
Hanar.

18:20.679 --> 18:22.806
What do you want,
human?

18:22.882 --> 18:24.611
Mr. Spock is ill.

18:24.683 --> 18:27.117
The doctor thinks
he may be dying.

18:29.755 --> 18:32.189
This illness came on him
rather suddenly.

18:32.258 --> 18:33.691
Is it not unusual?

18:33.759 --> 18:36.193
He's a Vulcan.
They don't react like humans.

18:36.262 --> 18:38.696
If I can get him
to sick bay,

18:38.764 --> 18:40.288
there's a chance
he'll live.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.768
Stand away from the door.

18:54.079 --> 18:56.013
I will have you
beamed aboard.

18:56.081 --> 18:58.948
Do what you can
with him, Bones.

19:06.358 --> 19:07.791
Doctor, what happened?

19:07.860 --> 19:09.953
Prepare two CCs
of stokaline.

19:10.029 --> 19:11.462
Stokaline?
But, Doctor, that --

19:11.530 --> 19:13.964
Don't argue, nurse.
Just get it.

19:25.044 --> 19:27.569
This may be the turning point.
Prepare another shot.

19:27.646 --> 19:28.578
But, Doc --

19:28.647 --> 19:29.579
Please, nurse.

19:29.648 --> 19:31.081
Just follow orders,
will you?

19:43.829 --> 19:45.763
There, that
should do it.

19:45.831 --> 19:47.765
Just let him
rest now.

19:49.935 --> 19:50.902
You see,

19:50.970 --> 19:54.872
it's a flare-up
of Rigelian Kassaba Fever.

19:54.940 --> 19:57.374
He suffered from it
about 10 years ago,

19:57.443 --> 19:59.877
and it recurs
every now and then.

19:59.945 --> 20:02.778
There's no danger
if he gets medication in time.

20:02.848 --> 20:04.440
He'll be all right soon.

20:04.517 --> 20:05.779
Very well.

20:05.851 --> 20:08.615
I will inform Rojan.
You will stay here.

20:15.961 --> 20:17.223
What do you want?

20:17.296 --> 20:20.857
We will beam aboard.
I wish you to understand your duties.

20:20.933 --> 20:23.163
My duty is to stop you.

20:23.235 --> 20:24.668
You will obey.

20:24.737 --> 20:26.671
Or you'll kill
more of my people.

20:26.739 --> 20:27.706
Captain Kirk,

20:27.773 --> 20:31.573
I cannot believe
that you do not understand

20:31.644 --> 20:33.578
the importance
of my mission.

20:33.646 --> 20:36.080
We Kelvans have
a code of honor.

20:36.148 --> 20:37.877
Harsh, demanding.

20:37.950 --> 20:40.578
It calls for much
from us ...

20:40.653 --> 20:43.588
and much from those
whom we conquer.

20:43.656 --> 20:45.647
You have been conquered.

20:47.092 --> 20:49.526
I respect your devotion
to your duty,

20:49.595 --> 20:53.361
but I cannot permit it
to interfere with mine.

20:53.432 --> 20:54.865
These are lovely.

20:54.934 --> 20:56.299
Captain Kirk,

20:56.368 --> 20:58.302
what is it you call them?

21:00.272 --> 21:01.204
Flowers.

21:01.273 --> 21:03.104
I don't know
the variety.

21:04.243 --> 21:06.677
Our memory tapes
tell us of such things

21:06.745 --> 21:07.677
on Kelvan.

21:07.746 --> 21:10.510
Crystals that form
with such rapidity,

21:10.583 --> 21:12.778
they seem to grow.

21:12.851 --> 21:16.048
They look like
this fragile thing somewhat.

21:16.121 --> 21:18.612
We call them sahsheer.

21:18.691 --> 21:20.625
A rose by
any other name.

21:20.693 --> 21:21.625
Captain?

21:23.562 --> 21:26.656
A quote from
a great human poet ...

21:26.732 --> 21:28.757
Shakespeare.

21:28.834 --> 21:31.860
"That which we call a rose
by any other name ...

21:34.173 --> 21:36.107
would smell as sweet."

21:45.718 --> 21:48.346
Drea has laid a course
for Kelva, Captain.

21:49.755 --> 21:51.245
We've jumped to warp 8.

21:51.323 --> 21:52.756
We'll go faster yet.

21:52.825 --> 21:55.157
Increase speed
to warp 11.

21:57.363 --> 21:59.797
Increase speed
to warp 11, Mr. Chekov.

22:03.235 --> 22:05.669
On course and proceeding
as planned.

22:05.738 --> 22:08.832
We will approach the barrier
within an hour.

22:08.907 --> 22:10.340
Very well.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.684
I'm going to sick bay.

22:19.752 --> 22:21.344
My first officer's
taken ill.

22:21.420 --> 22:22.853
Yes, I was informed.

22:22.921 --> 22:24.354
You may go.

22:29.461 --> 22:30.393
Anything?

22:30.462 --> 22:32.191
I've located
their power source.

22:32.264 --> 22:33.697
It's installed
in engineering.

22:33.766 --> 22:35.199
We're going to
Jam it.

22:35.267 --> 22:38.634
I've tied in all the lab computers.
That will give it a bit more power.

22:51.917 --> 22:53.646
This is it.

22:53.719 --> 22:55.152
All we have to do --

22:55.220 --> 22:57.654
Whatever we must do,
it is impossible.

22:57.723 --> 22:59.054
Why?

22:59.124 --> 23:00.557
This material surrounding
the projector

23:00.626 --> 23:03.493
is the same as I discovered
on the planet.

23:03.562 --> 23:06.053
Readings indicate
it is impervious to our weapons.

23:06.131 --> 23:07.723
We cannot
penetrate the casing

23:07.800 --> 23:10.268
to get to
the machine.

23:10.335 --> 23:11.768
That's it, then.

23:11.837 --> 23:15.238
There is one other
possibility, Mr. Scott.

23:15.307 --> 23:18.242
The final decision, of course,
must be the captain's,

23:18.310 --> 23:20.744
but we must have it
ready for him.

23:20.813 --> 23:22.246
The Enterprise
is propelled

23:22.314 --> 23:24.509
by matter-anti-matter
reactors.

23:24.583 --> 23:27.245
The barrier
we must traverse

23:27.319 --> 23:30.220
is negative energy.

23:30.289 --> 23:32.223
I see what
you're getting at.

23:32.291 --> 23:34.225
I can't say I like it.

23:34.293 --> 23:36.090
Nor I.

23:36.161 --> 23:39.096
But it must be made available
to the captain.

23:46.338 --> 23:48.772
Captain Kirk
to the bridge, please.

23:57.416 --> 23:59.043
Well?

23:59.118 --> 24:00.085
Impossible, Captain.

24:00.152 --> 24:02.552
The power source
is protected by a material

24:02.621 --> 24:04.748
we cannot breach
even with our phasers.

24:09.194 --> 24:11.628
Mr. Scott and I
have prepared the means

24:11.697 --> 24:14.131
for the only
logical alternative.

24:14.199 --> 24:16.463
What alternative?

24:16.535 --> 24:17.968
The barrier
we must penetrate

24:18.036 --> 24:19.469
is composed
of negative energy.

24:19.538 --> 24:21.972
I have opened
the control valves

24:22.040 --> 24:24.474
to the matter-anti-matter nacelles.

24:24.543 --> 24:26.067
On your signal,

24:26.145 --> 24:28.113
I'll flood them
with positive energy.

24:28.180 --> 24:29.613
When we
engage the barrier,

24:29.681 --> 24:31.114
the ship will explode.

24:31.183 --> 24:33.378
The Kelvans will
be stopped here.

24:33.452 --> 24:34.783
And so will we.

24:34.853 --> 24:36.286
Are you mad?

24:36.355 --> 24:37.913
I can't just --

24:39.458 --> 24:40.891
Take your places,
gentlemen.

24:40.959 --> 24:42.517
We're approaching
the barrier.

25:23.101 --> 25:25.865
Captain 's log,
stardate 4658.9.

25:25.938 --> 25:28.372
With The Enterprise
under control of the Kelvans,

25:28.440 --> 25:30.374
we are approaching
the energy barrier

25:30.442 --> 25:32.535
at the edge of our galaxy.

25:32.611 --> 25:35.512
Spock and Scotty
have devised a suicide plan

25:35.581 --> 25:37.014
to stop the Kelvans.

25:37.082 --> 25:39.778
They have rigged the ship
to explode

25:39.852 --> 25:41.285
on my signal.

25:43.021 --> 25:44.181
Reading, Spock.

25:44.256 --> 25:46.247
Sensors indicate
density negative,

25:46.325 --> 25:47.690
radiation negative,

25:47.759 --> 25:49.249
energy negative.

26:00.005 --> 26:01.939
All instruments
off the dial, Captain.

26:02.007 --> 26:04.100
We are in contact
with the barrier.

26:06.311 --> 26:08.609
Outside hull temperatures
rising, sir.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.944
Over 2,000 degrees now.

26:13.952 --> 26:15.749
Sir!

26:19.391 --> 26:20.449
Hold your position.

26:58.430 --> 27:00.523
We ...

27:00.599 --> 27:01.623
made it.

27:03.902 --> 27:06.393
Instruments returning
to normal, Captain.

27:08.573 --> 27:10.837
All decks report
damage and casualties.

27:10.909 --> 27:12.342
Several systems
out, sir.

27:12.411 --> 27:13.673
Operating on
emergency backup.

27:13.745 --> 27:14.871
None affect
flight procedure.

27:14.947 --> 27:17.711
Life support systems
sustaining on emergency.

27:17.783 --> 27:20.877
I'll have a full report
in a moment, sir.

27:20.953 --> 27:23.353
Your people are
most efficient, Captain.

27:23.422 --> 27:24.912
Thank you.

27:24.990 --> 27:27.083
So are yours.

27:27.159 --> 27:28.421
Hanar,

27:28.493 --> 27:31.053
start the neutralizing operation.

27:34.599 --> 27:37.363
What neutralizing
operation?

27:37.436 --> 27:39.495
You humans are
troublesome for us.

27:40.639 --> 27:42.072
We needed you

27:42.140 --> 27:44.074
to get us through
the barrier.

27:44.142 --> 27:46.076
But there aren't
enough of us

27:46.144 --> 27:48.169
to guard all of you.

27:48.246 --> 27:49.679
Further, the food
synthesizers

27:49.748 --> 27:53.081
cannot manufacture enough food
for the entire journey.

27:53.151 --> 27:55.142
We are therefore
neutralizing

27:55.220 --> 27:56.653
all nonessential
personnel.

27:56.722 --> 27:58.189
No.

27:58.256 --> 28:00.247
The procedure
is already underway.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.720
Now, as to
bridge personnel ...

28:06.064 --> 28:07.793
Drea.

28:15.807 --> 28:18.435
We have no need
for communication.

28:28.820 --> 28:30.253
And since Drea
is capable

28:30.322 --> 28:33.348
of handling the ship
from here on ...

29:25.777 --> 29:28.211
Do you not agree
that this is better

29:28.280 --> 29:29.713
than exploding
the ship

29:29.781 --> 29:32.807
as your engineer
had thought to do?

29:32.884 --> 29:35.409
We detected it,
of course.

29:36.488 --> 29:38.422
Tomar has
devised a mechanism

29:38.490 --> 29:40.515
to prevent any
further tampering.

29:40.592 --> 29:42.184
Please accept
your situation, Captain.

29:42.260 --> 29:44.694
It will make things
much less painful.

29:59.611 --> 30:01.044
Is this all?

30:01.113 --> 30:04.173
I have reviewed
ship's personnel, Captain.

30:04.249 --> 30:05.682
It appears we four

30:05.750 --> 30:08.241
are the only ones
the Kelvans consider essential.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.754
Scotty tells me you could've
destroyed the ship

30:10.822 --> 30:12.255
in the barrier.

30:12.324 --> 30:13.757
- Why didn't you?
- I couldn't.

30:13.825 --> 30:16.259
- It was our only chance to stop --
- I didn't think it was.

30:16.328 --> 30:17.761
Bones, that's enough!

30:17.829 --> 30:20.764
I saw them reduce
four of my doctors into those --

30:20.832 --> 30:22.595
They reduced
the whole crew!

30:30.041 --> 30:32.976
I do not understand
why you take the trouble

30:33.044 --> 30:35.979
to consume
this bulk material

30:36.047 --> 30:38.140
to sustain yourselves.

30:38.216 --> 30:40.650
We have ascertained
that these contain

30:40.719 --> 30:42.482
all the nutritional
elements.

30:42.554 --> 30:44.818
Before you condemn it,
why not try it?

30:44.890 --> 30:46.152
I believe I will.

30:46.224 --> 30:47.156
Assist me.

30:48.927 --> 30:51.395
It's your idea, Doctor.
Go ahead.

30:51.463 --> 30:54.398
All right, I'll show you
how to work the selector.

31:23.695 --> 31:25.629
Sir, why don't we
try again

31:25.697 --> 31:27.631
to knock out the
paralysis projector?

31:27.699 --> 31:29.633
I know the casing
looks impenetrable,

31:29.701 --> 31:32.226
but I may be able
to do something.

31:32.304 --> 31:33.737
We need that projector

31:33.805 --> 31:36.933
to bring our people
back to human form.

31:37.008 --> 31:38.635
How will we stop them?

31:38.710 --> 31:40.041
[Spock]
Captain.

31:43.014 --> 31:44.447
It's quite good.

31:45.617 --> 31:47.050
I'm delighted.

31:55.193 --> 31:57.093
Most curious.

31:57.162 --> 31:58.390
What is?

31:58.463 --> 32:01.398
The isolated glimpses
of things I saw

32:01.466 --> 32:03.161
when I touched
Kelinda's mind

32:03.235 --> 32:05.601
are beginning to coalesce
in my consciousness.

32:05.670 --> 32:09.106
The Kelvans have superior
intellectual capacity.

32:09.174 --> 32:10.607
To achieve it,

32:10.675 --> 32:12.108
they have apparently
sacrificed

32:12.177 --> 32:14.839
anything which would
tend to distract them.

32:14.913 --> 32:16.471
Perceptive senses

32:16.548 --> 32:18.482
such as taste,
touch, smell,

32:18.550 --> 32:21.246
and, of course, emotions.

32:21.319 --> 32:23.253
But then Tomar

32:23.321 --> 32:25.755
shouldn't be enjoying
the taste of his food.

32:25.824 --> 32:26.756
Yes.

32:26.825 --> 32:28.258
Quite correct, Captain.

32:28.326 --> 32:30.760
But they have taken
human form

32:30.829 --> 32:34.959
and are therefore
having human reaction.

32:41.172 --> 32:42.104
Hmm.

32:42.173 --> 32:44.107
If he keeps reacting
like that,

32:44.175 --> 32:45.437
he'll need a diet.

32:45.510 --> 32:48.946
If they all respond
to stimulation of the senses,

32:49.014 --> 32:51.346
then maybe we can
distract them.

32:51.416 --> 32:54.351
They can't have been able
to handle the senses yet.

32:54.419 --> 32:56.853
If we can confuse
them enough,

32:56.921 --> 32:59.947
we can get those devices
from their belts.

33:00.025 --> 33:01.686
That seems reasonable.

33:01.760 --> 33:02.692
All right.

33:02.761 --> 33:05.127
It may be
our only chance.

33:05.196 --> 33:07.562
Look for any way

33:07.632 --> 33:09.065
to stimulate
the senses.

33:09.134 --> 33:11.568
I can think of one way
right off.

33:14.973 --> 33:17.771
Lad, you're going
to need something

33:17.842 --> 33:19.434
to wash that
down with.

33:19.511 --> 33:22.446
Have you ever tried
any Saurian brandy?

33:28.953 --> 33:30.887
I don't know
about that.

33:30.955 --> 33:33.014
Please articulate.

33:33.091 --> 33:35.525
That body of yours
is a bit anemic.

33:35.593 --> 33:37.527
Comes from taking
food in pills

33:37.595 --> 33:40.393
instead of
solid sustenance.

33:40.465 --> 33:41.898
What are you doing?

33:41.966 --> 33:43.627
Going to give you
a shot.

33:43.702 --> 33:46.500
High potency
vitamin concentrate.

33:46.571 --> 33:49.506
You'll need three a day
for a few days.

33:52.877 --> 33:55.846
And eat some
solid food, will ya?

34:10.228 --> 34:11.320
No more.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.492
Am I disturbing you?

34:20.004 --> 34:22.097
What is it you wish?

34:22.172 --> 34:23.264
I ...

34:23.341 --> 34:24.967
wish to apologize.

34:25.043 --> 34:27.237
I don't understand,
Captain.

34:27.312 --> 34:29.246
For hitting you.
I'm sorry.

34:29.313 --> 34:30.746
That is not necessary.

34:30.815 --> 34:33.943
You attempted to escape
as we would have.

34:34.018 --> 34:35.451
Yes, well, I ...

34:35.520 --> 34:36.953
don't usually
go around

34:37.021 --> 34:39.819
beating up
beautiful women.

34:39.891 --> 34:41.051
Why not?

34:41.126 --> 34:42.559
Well, there are
better things

34:42.627 --> 34:44.458
for men and women
to do.

34:44.529 --> 34:46.496
Like what?

34:52.637 --> 34:54.571
Is this
where I hit you?

34:54.639 --> 34:56.129
No, the other side.

34:56.206 --> 34:57.139
Oh.

34:57.208 --> 34:58.607
I'm sorry.

35:00.879 --> 35:02.312
Is that better?

35:02.380 --> 35:03.312
Better?

35:03.381 --> 35:05.440
Was it intended
as a remedy?

35:09.287 --> 35:10.515
This is.

35:18.496 --> 35:21.329
Is there some significance
to this action?

35:24.235 --> 35:26.999
Well, among humans,
it's, uh ...

35:27.071 --> 35:29.005
meant to express ...

35:29.073 --> 35:30.665
warmth and love.

35:30.742 --> 35:32.505
Oh.

35:32.577 --> 35:34.477
You are trying
to seduce me.

35:36.514 --> 35:37.947
I have been
studying you.

35:39.350 --> 35:40.282
Me?

35:40.351 --> 35:41.750
All humans.

35:41.820 --> 35:43.253
This business
of love ...

35:43.321 --> 35:46.256
you have devoted
much literature to it.

35:46.324 --> 35:49.259
Why do you build
such a mystique

35:49.327 --> 35:51.192
around a simple
biological function?

35:53.298 --> 35:54.731
We enjoy it.

35:54.799 --> 35:56.323
The literature?

35:56.401 --> 35:59.336
Kelinda, I'm sorry
I brought up the whole subject.

35:59.404 --> 36:00.837
Do you
really regard

36:00.905 --> 36:03.203
this touching
of the lips as pleasurable?

36:03.274 --> 36:04.138
I did.

36:04.209 --> 36:06.109
Curious.

36:07.412 --> 36:08.845
Let me try.

36:19.557 --> 36:21.491
Is there some
problem, Captain?

36:21.559 --> 36:24.050
Not when I came in.

36:26.397 --> 36:27.830
What did he
want here?

36:27.899 --> 36:30.333
He came to apologize
for hitting me.

36:30.401 --> 36:33.666
Apparently it involves
some peculiar touching contact.

36:33.738 --> 36:35.228
In what manner?

36:43.548 --> 36:46.142
Very odd creatures,
these humans.

36:59.430 --> 37:00.863
Do you have more?

37:03.468 --> 37:05.163
Not of this.

37:05.236 --> 37:06.726
Well, anything.

37:13.077 --> 37:16.012
Yes. Humans are
very peculiar.

37:16.080 --> 37:19.049
I often find them
unfathomable.

37:19.117 --> 37:21.915
But an interesting
psychological study.

37:21.986 --> 37:24.921
Well, I do not understand
this business

37:24.989 --> 37:28.948
of pressing with
the lips to apologize.

37:29.027 --> 37:31.962
I believe you're
referring to a kiss.

37:32.030 --> 37:33.964
But it is
my understanding

37:34.032 --> 37:36.933
that such apologies
are usually exchanged

37:37.001 --> 37:39.799
between people who have
some affection

37:39.871 --> 37:41.304
for each other.

37:41.372 --> 37:44.307
Kelinda has no affection
for Captain Kirk.

37:46.811 --> 37:48.540
Your game is off.

37:50.081 --> 37:52.515
Are you disturbed
by the incident?

37:52.584 --> 37:55.314
Why should I
be disturbed?

37:55.386 --> 37:57.320
You've known Kelinda
for some time.

37:57.388 --> 37:59.356
She's a Kelvan
as you are.

37:59.424 --> 38:03.690
Among humans, I've found
the symptoms you're displaying

38:03.761 --> 38:05.353
usually
indicate jealousy.

38:05.430 --> 38:08.922
I have no reason
for such a reaction.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.298
Kelinda's a female,
nothing more.

38:13.404 --> 38:15.838
Captain Kirk seems
to find her quite attractive.

38:15.907 --> 38:17.431
Well, of course she is!

38:17.508 --> 38:19.305
- You are not jealous?
- No!

38:19.377 --> 38:21.277
- Nor upset?
- Certainly not.

38:26.918 --> 38:28.112
Checkmate.

38:33.958 --> 38:36.756
I found this on
Ganymood ...

38:36.828 --> 38:38.557
uh, Ganymede.

38:38.630 --> 38:40.063
What is it?

38:40.131 --> 38:42.156
Well, it's, um ...

38:45.069 --> 38:46.400
it's green.

38:56.214 --> 38:58.512
Kelinda, I've
been thinking.

38:58.583 --> 38:59.515
Yes?

38:59.584 --> 39:02.018
I do not wish you
to fraternize

39:02.086 --> 39:03.519
with any
of the humans.

39:03.588 --> 39:04.452
Why not?

39:04.522 --> 39:06.319
Well, they ...

39:06.391 --> 39:08.325
they offer such
strange ideas.

39:08.393 --> 39:10.122
They're not
meant for us.

39:10.194 --> 39:11.627
Not for Kelvans.

39:11.696 --> 39:14.096
Have you given this order
to the others?

39:14.165 --> 39:17.498
No. I wish you to particularly
avoid Captain Kirk.

39:17.568 --> 39:19.126
I will not!

39:19.203 --> 39:21.637
You have told me
over and over again

39:21.706 --> 39:23.640
humans are
no threat to us.

39:23.708 --> 39:25.141
We are superior.

39:25.209 --> 39:27.177
I will do
as I please.

39:27.245 --> 39:29.770
You will do as I say,

39:29.847 --> 39:32.782
or I will neutralize
your Captain Kirk

39:32.850 --> 39:35.375
and all the other humans
as well.

39:51.302 --> 39:53.236
How many more of these?

39:53.304 --> 39:54.737
Well, now, let's see.

39:54.806 --> 39:56.239
You've had
three shots ...

39:56.307 --> 39:59.242
you better stay
on them for a few days,

39:59.310 --> 40:01.301
then we'll see
how you're responding.

40:01.379 --> 40:04.314
I see no reason for you
to refer to yourself

40:04.382 --> 40:05.815
in the plural.

40:14.225 --> 40:15.487
You have more?

40:15.560 --> 40:16.993
All I have

40:17.061 --> 40:22.021
is a bottle of
very, very, very old scotch.

40:24.068 --> 40:25.160
Whiskey!

40:25.236 --> 40:26.669
I will try it.

40:26.738 --> 40:28.262
I'll get it!

40:28.339 --> 40:29.431
[Glass Breaks]

40:36.814 --> 40:38.748
I was
saving you for --

40:38.816 --> 40:39.976
What?

40:41.352 --> 40:42.683
Never mind.

40:42.754 --> 40:44.483
Give us your glass.

40:49.227 --> 40:51.661
I can't tell
if we're getting anywhere.

40:51.729 --> 40:54.163
And I haven't seen Scotty
in hours.

40:54.232 --> 40:55.665
We haven't seen
Tomar either.

40:55.733 --> 40:58.668
But Hanar is getting
more irritable by the minute.

40:58.736 --> 41:00.670
I'm giving him
shots of formazine.

41:00.738 --> 41:03.172
That should have him
climbing the walls.

41:03.241 --> 41:05.573
Rojan has exhibited
symptoms of jealousy.

41:07.478 --> 41:09.878
I would like to
speak with you, Captain.

41:12.150 --> 41:13.412
Doctor,

41:13.484 --> 41:16.419
I'm due for another
injection of stokaline.

41:16.487 --> 41:19.354
Hmm?

41:19.423 --> 41:20.355
Stokaline.

41:20.424 --> 41:21.652
Oh.

41:24.295 --> 41:26.092
You will pardon us.

41:30.301 --> 41:32.235
You had something
to say?

41:32.303 --> 41:33.270
Yes.

41:34.539 --> 41:35.972
This cultural mystique

41:36.040 --> 41:37.974
surrounding the
biological function.

41:38.042 --> 41:38.974
Yes.

41:39.043 --> 41:42.171
You realize humans
are overly preoccupied

41:42.246 --> 41:43.679
with the subject.

41:43.748 --> 41:47.240
Yes. We do think
a great deal about it.

41:48.886 --> 41:51.821
I've done some
supplemental reading on it,

41:51.889 --> 41:52.947
and, uh ...

41:53.024 --> 41:55.390
You have a question?

41:55.459 --> 41:56.824
Yes.

41:56.894 --> 41:58.327
I was wondering,

41:58.396 --> 42:01.763
would you please
apologize to me again?

42:08.739 --> 42:11.173
Rojan, I want
to talk to you.

42:11.242 --> 42:14.177
I do not like the way
duty has been portioned out.

42:14.245 --> 42:17.180
It's the way your duties
have always been assigned.

42:17.248 --> 42:18.681
That is my
second quarrel.

42:18.749 --> 42:21.183
I do not care
for the way

42:21.252 --> 42:22.685
you run this ship.

42:22.753 --> 42:24.186
Confine yourself
to your quarters!

42:35.233 --> 42:38.566
Ohhh, Rojan has
forbidden me to see you.

42:38.636 --> 42:41.070
Yes, that's too bad.

42:41.138 --> 42:43.072
Why do you defy him?

42:43.140 --> 42:45.074
It's not a question
of defiance.

42:45.142 --> 42:48.578
We were told to find out
everything we could about you.

42:48.646 --> 42:50.079
Well, how's
the research going?

42:50.147 --> 42:53.378
I need some more
experiments.

43:00.258 --> 43:03.193
Mr. Spock, you were not
ordered to the bridge.

43:03.261 --> 43:04.694
What is
your purpose here?

43:04.762 --> 43:05.626
Automatic sensors

43:05.696 --> 43:07.664
and various other
recording devices

43:07.732 --> 43:10.599
require monitoring
and periodic adjustments.

43:10.668 --> 43:12.226
Very well. Proceed.

43:23.214 --> 43:24.647
Have you seen
Captain Kirk?

43:24.715 --> 43:28.151
If you wish, I shall
call him to the bridge.

43:28.219 --> 43:29.982
I was wondering
where he was.

43:30.054 --> 43:32.989
I left him in
the recreation room.

43:33.057 --> 43:34.490
He was alone then.

43:34.558 --> 43:36.492
No, Kelinda
was with him.

43:36.560 --> 43:40.189
She seemed anxious
to speak to him.

43:40.264 --> 43:42.698
I told her
to stay away from him.

43:42.767 --> 43:45.827
It would appear that you
have little control over her.

43:45.903 --> 43:47.837
Or perhaps...

43:47.905 --> 43:50.533
Captain Kirk has more.

44:08.993 --> 44:10.688
Very interesting.

44:12.763 --> 44:15.698
But I feel rather ...

44:15.766 --> 44:17.165
strange.

44:25.743 --> 44:27.176
We did it,

44:27.244 --> 44:29.712
you and me.

44:29.780 --> 44:32.681
Put him right
under the table.

44:47.431 --> 44:49.695
I'll take this
to the captain.

45:09.754 --> 45:12.348
Kelinda, I told you
to avoid this human.

45:12.423 --> 45:14.118
I did not wish to.

45:14.191 --> 45:15.954
I am your commander.

45:16.027 --> 45:19.155
That's not enough,
Rojan.

45:19.230 --> 45:21.664
You did this to her,
corrupted her,

45:21.732 --> 45:23.165
turned her
away from me!

45:23.234 --> 45:26.169
If you can't keep her,
that's not my problem.

45:26.237 --> 45:27.169
Release her!

45:49.693 --> 45:51.627
Why don't you use
your paralyzer?

46:05.709 --> 46:08.644
You thought I was taking
your woman away from you.

46:08.712 --> 46:09.679
You're jealous!

46:09.747 --> 46:12.648
You tried to kill me
with your bare hands.

46:12.716 --> 46:14.149
Would a Kelvan do that?

46:14.218 --> 46:16.652
You're reacting
with the emotions of a human.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.153
You are a human.

46:18.222 --> 46:20.656
No, I cannot be!

46:20.724 --> 46:22.157
I'm stimulating him.

46:31.702 --> 46:33.499
You have no choice.

46:37.541 --> 46:39.441
To use this ship,

46:39.510 --> 46:41.444
you have to use
our form.

46:41.512 --> 46:42.945
Now you're
stuck with it,

46:43.013 --> 46:44.446
you and
your descendants

46:44.515 --> 46:46.005
for the next
300 years.

46:46.083 --> 46:47.812
These bodies are tools.

46:47.885 --> 46:49.182
We remain Kelvans!

46:49.253 --> 46:52.689
Look what's happened in the time
you've been exposed to us.

46:52.756 --> 46:54.690
What will happen
in three centuries?

46:54.758 --> 46:56.692
When this ship
gets to Kelva ...

46:56.760 --> 46:59.194
the people on it
will be human.

46:59.263 --> 47:01.060
They'll be aliens,
enemies!

47:01.132 --> 47:03.032
We have a duty ...

47:03.100 --> 47:04.032
our mission ...

47:04.101 --> 47:06.467
we've got to accomplish
any way we can.

47:06.537 --> 47:08.971
Your mission is
to find new worlds

47:09.039 --> 47:10.973
for your people
to live in.

47:11.041 --> 47:13.475
We can bring this problem
to the federation.

47:13.544 --> 47:16.479
There are many planets
in this galaxy

47:16.547 --> 47:18.242
that can
be inhabited.

47:20.918 --> 47:22.408
You would really do that?

47:22.486 --> 47:26.684
You would extend welcome
to invaders?

47:26.757 --> 47:27.849
No.

47:29.393 --> 47:31.486
But we would
welcome friends.

47:33.130 --> 47:35.564
Rojan, you are only
a link in a chain

47:35.633 --> 47:38.329
following an order
given 300 years ago.

47:38.402 --> 47:39.835
This is an opportunity

47:39.904 --> 47:42.634
for you to establish
a destiny of your own.

47:48.012 --> 47:49.445
Perhaps.

47:50.814 --> 47:52.748
Perhaps it could be done.

47:54.618 --> 47:57.052
A robot ship
could be sent to Kelva

47:57.121 --> 47:59.248
with the Federation
proposal.

48:00.558 --> 48:02.253
But ...

48:02.326 --> 48:04.021
if we retain this form,

48:04.094 --> 48:06.722
where could we
find a place?

48:06.797 --> 48:10.733
That little planet you were on
is kind of nice.

48:14.205 --> 48:15.297
And you ...

48:16.907 --> 48:19.467
you would wish
to remain with him?

48:21.212 --> 48:22.645
He's most interesting.

48:22.713 --> 48:24.908
But I wish to go with you.

48:24.982 --> 48:26.643
I owe you an apology.

48:36.327 --> 48:37.794
Most pleasurable.

48:40.631 --> 48:42.258
Yes.

48:42.333 --> 48:43.391
Very curious.

48:43.467 --> 48:45.332
You see, Rojan,

48:45.402 --> 48:47.336
being human does have
certain advantages.

48:47.404 --> 48:50.339
Being able to appreciate
the beauty of a flower ...

48:50.407 --> 48:52.068
or a woman.

48:58.582 --> 48:59.514
Bridge ...

48:59.583 --> 49:01.016
this is Rojan.

49:01.085 --> 49:02.245
Yes, Commander.

49:02.319 --> 49:05.447
I'm returning command
of the ship to Captain Kirk.

49:05.522 --> 49:06.955
You will follow
his orders.

49:07.024 --> 49:08.116
Sir?

49:10.060 --> 49:11.493
Turn the ship around.

49:13.430 --> 49:14.863
We're going home.
