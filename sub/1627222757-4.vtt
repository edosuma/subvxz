WEBVTT

00:05.339 --> 00:06.707
Previously on Heels...

00:06.741 --> 00:08.709
My brother betrayed me!

00:08.743 --> 00:10.644
I'm not entirely sure folks
want to see Ace do anything

00:10.678 --> 00:12.313
after you made him cry
in the ring.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.414
Are people
talking about us?

00:13.447 --> 00:14.749
'Cause if they are,
that's a good thing.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.485
Mr. and Mrs. Eddie and Annie Earl,
good to see y'all.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.587
My banner is missing
the verse from Revelation

00:19.620 --> 00:21.188
that I had sent over to y'all.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.223
Would you get the fuck off me?

00:22.256 --> 00:23.624
I'm not your boyfriend.
How clear can I be?

00:23.657 --> 00:27.194
And if DWL's a problem for you, do--
just don't come to the shows.

00:27.228 --> 00:29.630
I have to come, Jack,
because it's our whole life.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.699
What the fuck
was that shit, Jack?

00:31.732 --> 00:33.667
The whole fucking crowd
was booing me.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.470
They were all chanting.
You'd make a really good heel!

00:36.504 --> 00:39.440
This is what you wanted,
ain't it, Jack?

00:39.473 --> 00:41.776
-No!
-Take it, Bobby!

00:41.809 --> 00:43.244
I'm a heel now.

00:47.081 --> 00:48.716
I fucked up pretty bad.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.315
Behold our new title belt.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.284
We're still waiting
for the boss to sign off

02:30.317 --> 02:31.585
on the redesigned logo,

02:31.619 --> 02:33.287
which will go dead
in the center.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.389
Our research has revealed
an overlooked fact.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.857
If you sit
in the nosebleed seats,

02:36.891 --> 02:38.659
the current belts
are hard to see.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.861
But this revised
and improved title belt--

02:40.895 --> 02:42.162
highly visible.

02:42.196 --> 02:43.497
This dynamic redesign

02:43.531 --> 02:46.867
lends itself to premium
placement in toy stores.

02:46.901 --> 02:48.202
This is true.

02:48.235 --> 02:50.204
I think it needs sound effects.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.239
Make it beep and boop and shit.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.774
Perfect. Yeah, yeah.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.776
Kids will love playing with
it even more if we add that.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.212
Yeah, of course they will.

02:58.245 --> 03:01.181
That's all it is, is a toy...

03:01.215 --> 03:02.850
a toy I fractured my skull for,

03:02.883 --> 03:04.952
a toy I got
two knee replacements for,

03:05.185 --> 03:06.687
a toy I watched
a lot of friends die

03:06.720 --> 03:08.689
in a fucking gutter
chasing down.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.659
-Ha!

03:11.692 --> 03:14.662
-Whoo!

03:14.695 --> 03:18.465
Can we please remember this
is an office, not a ring, Bill?

03:18.499 --> 03:21.769
Oh, it's all a ring,
sweetheart.

03:21.802 --> 03:25.272
As a former champion,
we need you to get behind this.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.975
I hate this fucking belt.
It's a piece of shit.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.813
But I am
a reliable soldier, Maria.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.282
It's all good.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.717
Off to Cleveland.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.486
Gonna need to pack my robe,
if I'm getting back on camera.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.555
Nothing on camera this week,

03:41.589 --> 03:43.924
but good to be ready
if things change.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.004
Sir?

04:30.037 --> 04:32.740
Sir, are you okay in there?

04:35.676 --> 04:40.314
Oh, oh, oh. Ooh!

04:40.347 --> 04:42.650
Pardon me! Ha ha!

04:42.683 --> 04:46.353
Oh, yeah, y'all first-class
yuppie fucks filming this shit.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.821
Hell, I would, too.

04:47.855 --> 04:51.659
You're about to witness
a phoenix rise from the ashes.

04:51.692 --> 04:55.396
The ass-beating,
ass-eating man hisself!

04:56.897 --> 05:00.534
Here's what I think of
your toy, you corporate cunts.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.404
The kids gonna love
playing with it.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.438
Ah.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.939
Uh, we need an air marshal.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.508
Ooh!

05:14.848 --> 05:16.917
Breakfast in a half hour.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.952
You're not there,
you eat with the ducks.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.088
I really did it this time,
didn't I?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.057
Don't wallow. Come eat.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.325
Hey, tell Ted
to fetch me a towel.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.361
Don't push it.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.738
Staci. Hey, Staci, wake up!

05:37.771 --> 05:39.873
-Shit.
-What? Oh, my God.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.975
-Thomas?
-Oh, shit!

05:42.009 --> 05:44.078
-Hey, hey, get up.
-What?

05:44.111 --> 05:45.345
Want you to get out
of the house

05:45.379 --> 05:46.780
with your mom right now,
please.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.549
Dad, what's going on?
Not my blanket.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.683
Hey, get out of the house
right now!

05:49.717 --> 05:51.919
-Come on, baby.
-God damn it.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.948
You're going hard
on that maple syrup, Bill.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.817
My sister shipped that to us
from New Hampshire.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.419
It's pretty tasty, right?

06:25.452 --> 06:26.987
Well, syrup's syrup.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.589
The syrup's delicious, hon.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.825
If we're telling truths,
pancakes are a little dry, Ted.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.460
That's why I soaked 'em
in syrup.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.696
But they are filling. Grazie.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.664
Hey, look here.

06:38.832 --> 06:39.967
Whoo!

06:40.000 --> 06:43.137
See how big the censored bit
in the video is?

06:43.170 --> 06:45.105
Hard to hide
my natural blessing.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.607
Blurry but lengthy.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.841
Okay, you know what?
Put it away, please.

06:47.875 --> 06:48.575
-There she is.
-Knock it off.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.543
Hey.

06:49.576 --> 06:50.944
Hey, it's the prettiest
debutante in Duffy.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.447
Hey, Bill. Anything left
for breakfast today?

06:53.480 --> 06:56.650
-I'm a hungry guest, I admit.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.153
So what's the word?
Suspension? Fine?

06:59.186 --> 07:01.922
No, boss lady
just wants me to lay low

07:01.955 --> 07:03.423
until she sorts things out.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.992
I mean, I imagine post-9/11,

07:05.025 --> 07:06.994
you got some
U.S. Marshal issues here.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.963
Post-9/11--
that's a timely reference, Ted.

07:09.997 --> 07:14.001
Why not say post-Watergate,
or post-Berlin Wall?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.836
I raided a beverage cart.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.071
My story's put the league
back in the spotlight.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.807
This publicity's
good publicity.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.742
Calling your boss the C-word,
not so much.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.443
Is the C-word the "cock" word
or the "cunt" word?

07:23.477 --> 07:24.945
-No, no, no--
-Hey, what--we don't--no.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.980
-No, no that's not--
-Look, we say "the C-word"

07:27.014 --> 07:28.582
so we don't have to say
the actual word.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.217
No, and we don't say
the actual word

07:30.450 --> 07:32.219
because it's impolite to do so.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.554
Okay, just--

07:33.587 --> 07:37.958
Robin, to answer your question,

07:37.991 --> 07:40.794
both C-words
accurately describe

07:40.828 --> 07:42.496
the countless
corporate assholes

07:42.529 --> 07:45.599
who dismiss the input
of mavericks like myself--

07:45.632 --> 07:47.835
icons who built
a global enterprise

07:47.868 --> 07:49.837
who now must watch it
be destroyed

07:49.870 --> 07:52.840
by a ruthless lust for money.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.142
Cock words and cunt words,
the lot of 'em.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.512
But don't be afraid of words
or people.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.848
-How's school?
-It sucks.

08:00.881 --> 08:04.518
What kind of lies they telling
in U.S. history these days?

08:07.821 --> 08:10.557
Fire chief thinks the squirrels
ate through the wiring.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.959
I knew it.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.794
That was my favorite blanket.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.662
We're gonna make this
a good thing.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.030
Let's go to a hotel
that has a pool.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.765
-Yeah!
-No, no, no. I'm sorry.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.868
It's gonna cost a lot of money
to rewire the whole house.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.069
We got to save.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.104
Hey, the whole house
didn't go up in flames.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.006
Not yet. Will soon.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.174
You don't know that.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.876
Yeah, well, I do know
that our insurance

08:28.909 --> 08:30.143
won't cover all the damage.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.845
Look, we just--
it is what it is.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.947
We just have
no emergency cushion.

08:33.981 --> 08:37.150
We need to--I need--

08:37.184 --> 08:38.919
Jack, I've got to get a job.

08:38.952 --> 08:42.155
We got a real good meeting with
Eddie Earl today, all right?

08:42.189 --> 08:44.691
Bunch of money's gonna
come into the DWL.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.196
Have faith.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.699
Come on,
let's go pack for Grandma's.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.935
Come on, bud.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.005
Pajama pants and cowboy boots
are a good look on you.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.680
Ooh.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.582
I love fucking
to this song, baby.

09:08.615 --> 09:10.183
-Dude, there's a lady present.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.618
How about it, Crystal?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.320
You like getting down
with some tunes on?

09:13.553 --> 09:14.888
You don't have to answer that.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.657
No, I like to focus
on my own rhythm.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.959
-Mm.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.128
That's facts.
She and Ace need no music.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.829
Hey! You told me
you weren't looking.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.031
I wasn't looking.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.967
I heard, "You're hot."
"No, you are."

09:28.669 --> 09:29.970
Ace Spade,
lucky motherfucker now.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.305
Did he ever apologize to you

09:31.338 --> 09:33.707
for that crap he said
to you at the show?

09:33.740 --> 09:37.010
Ace ain't
the saying-sorry type.

09:37.044 --> 09:40.647
Now, that is a damn
good-looking head of hair.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.082
Thank you very much.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.085
Hey, Crystal,
um, I need a cut, too.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.620
I mean, I'm short cash,

09:46.653 --> 09:50.090
but I got this, uh, $20, uh,
TGI Friday's gift card.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.625
I mean, it's as good as money.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.994
Yeah, if you like TGI Friday's,

09:54.027 --> 09:56.930
which, lucky for you,
asshole, I do.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.733
-Quite a bit.
-Hey!

09:59.766 --> 10:01.234
Come on.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.338
Hey, Crystal, could you stop
by my trailer before you leave?

10:04.371 --> 10:05.872
I have something
I want to run by you.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.375
-Ooh.
-Okay, okay, okay.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.977
Okay, you got to run
something by her.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.378
-Sure thing, Bobby.
-Thanks.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.679
"Sure thing, Bobby."

10:12.713 --> 10:14.281
-Get out of here.
-"Sure thing, Bobby."

10:15.716 --> 10:17.351
Hey, you think Bobby
has any lice?

10:17.384 --> 10:19.252
'Cause I don't trust
that mullet.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.989
What about that beard of yours?

10:23.190 --> 10:24.992
-Hey, how's it going?
-Hey.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.662
Uh, do you want a water
or Diet Dr. Pepper or anything?

10:28.695 --> 10:31.031
-Um, I'm good.
-Okay. Come on in.

10:31.064 --> 10:35.302
Wow, this trailer
is, uh--is not gross.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.070
Yeah, my grandpa gave it to me.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.206
I just, you know,
want to honor him.

10:39.239 --> 10:41.141
I can't write
when it's dirty, either, so--

10:41.174 --> 10:43.010
-I didn't know you wrote.
-Yeah.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.712
I mean, mostly lyrics, and then
I started four graphic novels,

10:45.746 --> 10:47.414
but mostly it's rap,
like my entrance song.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.849
-So...

10:48.882 --> 10:50.884
Would you like to sit down?

10:50.917 --> 10:52.652
Yeah, sure.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.128
So, uh, what--what's going on?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.896
Uh...

11:07.701 --> 11:09.202
Who is Bobby Pin?

11:11.071 --> 11:13.440
-What do you mean?
-My character in the ring.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.776
I don't know who he is,
and it's a lot of pressure,

11:15.809 --> 11:17.944
because they want to keep
my feud with Ace going, and--

11:17.978 --> 11:19.846
Well, that's--that's amazing.
Congratulations.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.015
Thank you, but--she said
that my gimmick sucks.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.183
Well, she was probably
hungover.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.851
She said it's not her job

11:24.885 --> 11:26.953
to come up with something
that I could inhibit.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.124
-Inhabit?
-I'm not sure the difference.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.759
One of them is spelled
with an A.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.161
The other's spelled with an I.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.395
One prevents you

11:35.429 --> 11:37.230
from doing the thing
that you want--inhibit.

11:37.264 --> 11:40.333
And the other, you become
the thing that you want--

11:40.367 --> 11:42.069
inhabit.

11:42.102 --> 11:44.004
It's an amazing language,
English.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.773
-Yeah, I like my crosswords.
-Yeah.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.776
It's just,
if Jack hates my idea,

11:49.810 --> 11:51.311
he's not gonna give me a push.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.013
Don't waste your time
trying to predict

11:53.046 --> 11:55.849
what Jack will or won't do.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.918
I was really hoping
that you could help me think

11:57.951 --> 11:59.386
of something, like, badass.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.089
I'm not really sure
my taste suits the DWL.

12:02.122 --> 12:05.025
Yeah, but you're badass.
People respect you.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.195
Well, I definitely
know that's not true,

12:08.228 --> 12:10.397
but just tell me
what you were thinking.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.166
Word. Uh, this is a new song
I've been cooking up.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.201
Okay.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.207
Uh, well, this is it.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.441
Yeah.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.850
-Come on, let's go.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.490
-Uh, can--

12:38.024 --> 12:40.927
Okay, um...

12:40.961 --> 12:42.863
you know, when I see--
when I see this

12:42.896 --> 12:45.765
and I see all of this,

12:45.799 --> 12:48.001
I don't really see rap.

12:48.034 --> 12:49.769
Do you?

12:49.803 --> 12:50.804
No?

12:50.837 --> 12:52.973
No, you don't.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.909
Okay.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.545
All right,
so streaming's the key.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.514
We want to build out
our YouTube channel

13:00.547 --> 13:02.449
with a high-quality
streaming broadcast.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.483
That's--that's the hook.

13:03.517 --> 13:05.118
People come for the streaming,

13:05.152 --> 13:06.987
but they stay
for the back catalog.

13:07.020 --> 13:10.257
Got old matches,
uh, old promos, old heroes.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.193
The DWL's back catalog's
500 videotapes.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.561
They're sitting
at my mother's house.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.930
I would have taped over them
for my Hallmark movies.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.999
She would have.
She would have, I swear.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.534
Well, we got vintage Wild Bill,

13:20.567 --> 13:22.135
from when
he was starting his career

13:22.169 --> 13:23.970
and a bunch of other guys
you'd recognize

13:24.004 --> 13:25.405
that came through Duffy
as stringers.

13:25.438 --> 13:28.175
It's content. It's history.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.545
And it's a social-media manager
in Atlanta

13:31.578 --> 13:34.014
to digitize the tapes,
which is gonna cost.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.815
Uh, because everyone's phone's
with 'em all the time,

13:35.849 --> 13:38.151
the DWL can be with 'em
all the time, highlights.

13:38.185 --> 13:41.021
There we go--on Facebook,
on- on Twitter, Instagram.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.556
We got the TikTok, and, uh--

13:42.589 --> 13:44.491
-Build a DWL Snapchat filter.
-There we go.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.459
Let our fans
carry the promotion load.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.195
I love Facebook--

13:48.228 --> 13:50.230
connecting with old friends,
meeting new ones.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.232
-Yes, you do, dear.
-I love it. I do.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.902
And if I was gonna try to start
a baby wrestling league,

13:55.936 --> 13:56.970
this is how I'd do it.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.405
-Hmm.
-But I'm not.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.106
No, that's right. We are.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.942
We just need a little help
from our sponsor.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.177
Right. Uh, look, Annie,
Eddie, you know Jack.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.214
He's a true talent, he's
just a phenomenal storyteller.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.950
Uh, you know, now is the time
to get behind him.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.219
I've been in since the get-go.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.987
I'm giving you as much
as I'm comfortable.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.224
Any more just wouldn't be
a wise investment.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.993
What? Tell us why not, Eddie.

14:20.026 --> 14:23.630
Uh, supporting the DWL
is good for my pawn shop.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.532
-Mm-hmm.
-Because we're here in Duffy--

14:25.565 --> 14:27.634
a place where people
pawn things they cherish,

14:27.867 --> 14:30.237
because their backs
are up against the wall.

14:30.270 --> 14:34.107
We don't live in a
"taking chances" kind of world.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.442
Oh.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.077
Are you writing down
what he said?

14:37.110 --> 14:38.378
For his book.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.380
Now, my second-hand
car business,

14:40.413 --> 14:41.615
that's where I could use
the growth,

14:41.648 --> 14:43.483
but the DWL doesn't
help me there,

14:43.516 --> 14:45.352
'cause y'all ain't
got the reach.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.521
I told your father your biggest
problem i-is in the name.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.558
Duffy Wrestling League?
Every show's a house show.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.361
Anybody that gives a crap
lives in the area.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.629
Well, that's my point, Eddie.

14:55.662 --> 14:58.231
We need someone local
to get behind us,

14:58.265 --> 15:00.934
and then we can expand
our fanbase.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.402
There's got to be something
we can do here,

15:02.435 --> 15:04.070
to-to show you what we mean.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.572
Jack, I invest in the DWL

15:05.605 --> 15:07.641
because you provide
a captive audience

15:07.674 --> 15:09.976
that's emotionally invested
in make-believe,

15:10.010 --> 15:11.945
an audience made up
of folks who,

15:11.978 --> 15:13.313
despite their circumstances,

15:13.346 --> 15:15.148
believe that dreams
are gonna come true

15:15.181 --> 15:16.650
and their luck can change.

15:16.683 --> 15:21.187
But unless Duffy wins a bid
to be the next Amazon outpost

15:21.221 --> 15:24.591
or a hurricane
lops off half of Georgia,

15:24.624 --> 15:26.493
makes Duffy oceanfront,

15:26.526 --> 15:29.596
dreams aren't coming true,
and--and luck ain't turning,

15:29.629 --> 15:33.233
and the population of Duffy
ain't expanding.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.235
Neither is the DWL.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.470
-I'm sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.673
I see your sign out there
with the God, community,

15:39.706 --> 15:41.508
and the--the low pricing,

15:41.541 --> 15:44.044
and you're a--you're
a local entrepreneur

15:44.077 --> 15:47.580
and a man of faith
who's not showing any faith

15:47.614 --> 15:49.516
in the family he's known
for a long time.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.354
Annie, Eddie,
thank you.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.357
Thank you both. Look, I'm sorry.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.626
-Fucking piece of shit.
-Hey.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.294
-Yeah.
-Jack, wait up.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.096
Why the fuck he take
that fucking meeting?

16:03.129 --> 16:04.431
Because he's a businessman,

16:04.464 --> 16:06.099
that's why, and he's still
our main sponsor.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.535
Well, fuck him, because that
presentation was fucking good.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.003
-Okay.
-It made perfect fucking sense.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.204
Okay, Jack--

16:11.237 --> 16:12.672
And I want to take
that little motherfucker

16:12.706 --> 16:15.108
-and throw him through a wall.
-Hey, hey, hey, stop.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.243
Look at me.

16:17.277 --> 16:18.511
You're running way too hot.

16:18.545 --> 16:19.713
Well, the walls feel like

16:19.746 --> 16:21.181
they're closing
a little bit, Willie.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.549
Closing in doesn't mean
tumbling down just yet.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.117
So we work harder.
We stay focused.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.485
Not get emotional.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.020
Look, this thing of ours--

16:27.053 --> 16:29.022
this thing that we've put
so much time into

16:29.055 --> 16:30.357
will not succeed,

16:30.390 --> 16:32.158
if you let your emotions
get the better of you.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.428
So what? Eddie thinks
we don't have reach.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.531
You want that fish on the line,
we got to prove him wrong.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.233
Just go deal
with your fire fiasco.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.168
I've got my own fire
to put out with Billy.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.137
Why'd you let that fucking
jackass stay at your house?

16:44.170 --> 16:46.406
It's more occupying
than staying.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.042
He's drying out,
sleeping, worrying.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.144
He's terrified
of losing his job.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.579
Poor Wild Bill.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.748
Do you know what I would give
for his money or his problems?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.316
I don't understand
why you were ever with him.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.352
-You never had sex with him.
-Oh, God damn it, Willie.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.121
You said you didn't understand.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.589
There's a lot of things
a girl will overlook

17:02.622 --> 17:04.124
when the sex is great.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.525
Let's put that
on a fucking Post-It.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.427
Everyone knows
that one already.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.162
Look, the people you love
in your 20s,

17:09.195 --> 17:11.531
they get their hooks into you
in a fucked-up way.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.734
Things didn't end well
with me and Bill.

17:14.768 --> 17:17.137
I don't know, maybe me
letting him stay with us

17:17.170 --> 17:18.705
is a way to move past that.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.241
And, you know,
with Bill down on his luck,

17:21.274 --> 17:22.776
he might be willing
to promote us.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.744
He's got a hell of a lot more
people paying attention to him,

17:24.778 --> 17:27.414
for the first time in years.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.616
I don't want him
anywhere near me.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.461
Howdy.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.530
William, you need to play nice

17:43.563 --> 17:45.498
until I get
your renegotiation done.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.567
Paula, I can't recall
the last time

17:47.600 --> 17:49.269
you called me with good news.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.304
Last week I called you
about the Burger King spots

17:51.337 --> 17:52.672
with Ridley Scott,

17:52.705 --> 17:55.408
before you decided to call
your bosses corporate cunts.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.378
You're my manager.
I gave you something to manage.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.546
You're welcome.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.080
You want me to manage
your dick

18:01.114 --> 18:02.649
and teach you
how to keep it in your pants?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.484
Unfortunately,
your spending habits

18:04.517 --> 18:06.286
don't give you
a lot of leverage.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.488
I have spent the last
three years diversifying,

18:08.521 --> 18:10.089
like you advised.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.691
Oh, I never said invest
in the oil sands project

18:11.724 --> 18:13.126
in Alberta.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.527
I mean, what are you
driving right now?

18:14.561 --> 18:16.129
You driving a Corolla,

18:16.162 --> 18:18.364
or did you fucking upgrade
to an Escalade, hmm?

18:18.398 --> 18:20.233
You make choices
like you're the only one

18:20.266 --> 18:22.535
who's ever gonna win,
but you aren't.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.637
-You need to go to rehab.
-Oh.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.473
It is a legitimate gesture

18:26.506 --> 18:28.508
that they may respond to
with some compassion

18:28.541 --> 18:31.110
regarding your use of success
and service to them.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.612
Now, I am flying down there,

18:32.645 --> 18:34.280
and we're gonna hold
a press conference.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.449
You will say nothing,
post nothing,

18:36.483 --> 18:39.786
do nothing
until we speak in person.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.821
Got to go.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.423
I know it is just a cleaning,

18:43.456 --> 18:45.692
but can I get
some laughing gas?

18:48.561 --> 18:50.330
Oh, not that one.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.798
I don't know what this brand
feeds their chickens

18:51.831 --> 18:53.433
before they slaughter 'em,

18:53.466 --> 18:55.869
but I find that it has
more flavor and fries crispier.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.571
-Sour Patch Kids.
-No.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.141
Hey, Carol, you ever
want to get a job

19:02.175 --> 19:04.344
while you were raising
Jack and Ace?

19:04.377 --> 19:05.912
Aside from designing, cutting,

19:06.145 --> 19:08.515
and sewing the costumes for
my husband's wrestling league,

19:08.548 --> 19:10.884
while trying to keep
that husband happy?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.418
No.

19:12.452 --> 19:14.320
Gave my life to my boys.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.688
Always had one eye peeled,

19:15.722 --> 19:18.224
even while I was
at the sewing machine.

19:18.258 --> 19:21.361
Life of the mom.
Good one anyway.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.796
Why? Not why'd you
give your life to him,

19:23.830 --> 19:25.398
but why'd you never work?

19:25.431 --> 19:28.434
Raising kids is a full-time job
if you're doing it right.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.670
Anyone disagrees,
they are wrong.

19:30.703 --> 19:33.740
Uh, you don't want 'em living
too many hours with babysitters

19:33.773 --> 19:35.608
who don't love 'em,
who just think of 'em

19:35.642 --> 19:37.377
as an opportunity
to make money.

19:37.410 --> 19:41.314
But then
babysitters cost less.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.916
I thought
I'd be living elsewhere,

19:42.949 --> 19:45.418
but things turned out
differently.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.353
Oh, grab that, uh,
Pillsbury flour for me, please.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.955
I got a coupon
for the King Arthur.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.423
Well, at this stage of my life,

19:50.456 --> 19:52.225
I find something that works
for me, I stick with it.

19:52.258 --> 19:53.359
It's Pillsbury for me.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.768
All right, I think we got it.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.971
-Wow!

20:05.204 --> 20:07.874
Sweet. Bobby '85.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.776
Yeah, I mean, it's
the golden age of wrestling.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.944
You already got the mullet.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.912
Well, I mean, you gave me
a great cut, so...

20:12.946 --> 20:14.714
-It's nostalgia.
-Yeah.

20:14.747 --> 20:15.848
You know how
every movie's a remake

20:15.882 --> 20:17.216
'cause folks just want
to remember

20:17.250 --> 20:18.284
how good shit used to be?

20:18.318 --> 20:19.752
Yeah.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.521
I think I probably
have to stop eating, though,

20:21.554 --> 20:23.957
'cause you drew my abs
a little bit too good.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.626
-No, you look great.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.528
Thank you. It's awesome.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.997
Yeah, Bobby '85 it is.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.768
-Thank you, baby.
-Keep their tab open, will ya?

20:37.570 --> 20:40.306
Well, dang, I haven't
seen you in a hot minute.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.375
-What's up, Tricia?
-Figured you got back together

20:42.408 --> 20:43.977
with your little
trailer-park gal.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.745
Yeah, no.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.980
Uh, just been busy.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.748
Yeah, I bet.

20:48.781 --> 20:52.285
Hey, can I get a- a Miller
and 24 wings?

20:52.318 --> 20:53.820
Sure thing.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.827
Oh, by the way,
your friend is here.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.462
Kooky Bill.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.730
-Here here?
-Yeah.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.732
Yeah, he's in the bathroom
boozing and blowing oxy.

21:08.501 --> 21:11.037
Uh, hey, can I get
those wings to go, please?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.805
Yeah, but I get off in an hour.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.641
You should stay and flirt.

21:14.674 --> 21:18.044
The prince of Duffy. How goes?

21:18.277 --> 21:19.579
Super good, Bill. You?

21:19.612 --> 21:20.813
Super-duper good, son.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.416
I'll bet. I saw your, uh, video
on Barstool.

21:23.449 --> 21:24.784
Only helps to build my brand.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.519
Just ask Scarlett Jo Smoke Show
back there.

21:26.552 --> 21:27.654
I'll bet she's seen it.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.722
Yeah, you need a trim
down there, Bill.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.324
They don't call me Wild Bill
for nothing.

21:31.357 --> 21:32.859
I got untamed pubes.

21:34.560 --> 21:38.431
I'd eat a mile of her shit,
just to lick where it came out.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.766
How long you in town for?

21:39.799 --> 21:42.335
Headed back up
to headquarters any day now.

21:42.368 --> 21:43.703
Get me a new assignment.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.338
Very cool.

21:45.371 --> 21:48.441
Hey, listen...

21:48.474 --> 21:50.843
I know the last time we talked

21:50.877 --> 21:52.745
it was me squirting shit
into your pool.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.347
Hope you didn't take
that personally.

21:54.380 --> 21:56.015
I really did think
you had the goods.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.483
Did?

21:57.517 --> 22:00.953
Ha! Do. Still do.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.022
Thanks.

22:03.056 --> 22:04.657
You ain't leaving, are you?

22:04.691 --> 22:07.694
Yeah, we're having Jack's
family over for dinner tonight.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.796
Fuck that, man.
I know your mama.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.597
She don't do dinner at30.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.033
Let me grease the skids
with some beers,

22:14.067 --> 22:16.436
and let's hustle some pool.

22:16.469 --> 22:18.504
Your dad would love that.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.874
Taking money off these dunces
was one of Tom's superpowers.

22:21.908 --> 22:24.877
Come on, big man, let's play.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.420
That's my goddamn partner.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.856
Welcome to the woodshed.
Chop-chop.

22:42.495 --> 22:45.131
-I missed.
-No, no, not--

22:45.364 --> 22:46.899
I'm talking about,
where's the passion?

22:46.933 --> 22:49.435
Where's the anger?
You're a heel now.

22:49.469 --> 22:51.104
You got the perfect excuse.

22:51.137 --> 22:54.073
I don't want to talk
about wrestling.

22:54.107 --> 22:57.577
Then I guess you don't want
to talk about me

22:57.610 --> 23:00.413
pitching your new bad-guy
gimmick to the big boss.

23:00.446 --> 23:03.649
They really
didn't fire your ass?

23:03.683 --> 23:05.551
Fuck, no!

23:05.585 --> 23:08.421
They fucking love that video.
It was a promo.

23:08.454 --> 23:12.592
I'm just here taking time out,
as a formality, you know.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.694
Guys like me--and you--

23:14.727 --> 23:17.964
we ain't meant to stay
in these small-town shitholes.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.633
Your brother,
on the other hand...

23:21.868 --> 23:24.070
Your shot.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.982
-Uh-oh.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.894
You want to know the trick?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.529
To what?

23:49.562 --> 23:52.098
Every day a hundred things
happen to me

23:52.131 --> 23:54.467
make me want to spit.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.903
Fucking people
and all their bullshit,

23:56.936 --> 23:59.105
their untested manhood

23:59.138 --> 24:01.974
makes me want to step
on a frog,

24:02.008 --> 24:05.611
hear it crunch and ooze.

24:05.645 --> 24:09.749
No time for a final,
feeble ribbit.

24:09.782 --> 24:13.653
The regular folks,
they got to let that shit go.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.924
Puke out the black flies.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.092
But I use it.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.662
I soak it up.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.697
That's my superpower.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.167
Pay attention.

24:33.806 --> 24:37.176
Hey, you mind telling me what
happened to your nine ball?

24:37.210 --> 24:39.745
I don't recall
y'all sinking that one.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.216
Um...

24:43.249 --> 24:45.918
Ah, hmm.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.521
You shrugging, cheating

24:48.554 --> 24:51.724
chicken-dicks
snuck that ball in.

24:51.757 --> 24:53.226
-We didn't cheat.
-Uh-uh.

24:53.259 --> 24:55.261
The ball must have rolled in
on accident or something.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.630
You calling me a liar, cheater?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.799
Bet your wife's a cheater, too,
you little cuck.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.033
Don't talk about my wife.

25:01.067 --> 25:02.501
Dude, guys, just chill out,
all right, man?

25:02.535 --> 25:03.636
It's not a big deal.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.204
Hold on.
You gonna seriously tell me

25:05.238 --> 25:08.507
you don't let
someone else stick

25:08.541 --> 25:12.612
that fat-ass wife of yours,
you little fucking cuck bitch?

25:14.680 --> 25:16.849
Cuck-a-doodle-doo,
motherfucker!

25:16.883 --> 25:18.651
Hey, fuck you, man.

25:21.020 --> 25:22.955
What? You want to get rowdy?

25:22.989 --> 25:24.690
You gonna do something,
or you gonna stand there

25:24.724 --> 25:26.525
while I fuck you doggie style?

25:26.559 --> 25:27.827
Did you shave
your taint for me?

25:27.860 --> 25:30.129
You'd like that, wouldn't you,
you little cuck bitch?

25:30.162 --> 25:32.198
Sorry about the ball, okay?

25:32.231 --> 25:35.234
I'm just fucking with you.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.905
Ah! Whoo!

25:41.974 --> 25:43.542
Get the fuck out of here.

25:50.116 --> 25:53.052
That's why I'm the best
at what I do.

25:53.085 --> 25:57.790
Reckon you got it in you, too,
just like your dad.

25:57.823 --> 26:01.160
He played nice for the crowds,
but Tom had a vicious side.

26:01.193 --> 26:05.131
You tap that vein,
riches will flow.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.582
Mom, it's been 15 minutes.
The food's gonna get cold.

26:23.616 --> 26:25.818
But we eat together
as a family so rarely.

26:25.851 --> 26:28.721
I'd like to wait for
your brother, if that's okay.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.800
Take off your hat.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.668
Looks pretty good, though.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.273
Thomas, please say
the blessing.

26:50.343 --> 26:52.378
Dear God, thank You
for this dinner.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.246
Thank You for the Falcons,
the Braves,

26:54.280 --> 26:56.115
and especially the Bulldogs.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.783
God bless the chickens
that died,

26:57.817 --> 26:59.118
so they could be this food.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.820
God bless my family the most.

27:00.853 --> 27:03.756
Me, Mom, Dad,

27:03.789 --> 27:06.692
Uncle Ace, Granny, Gran-Gran,

27:06.726 --> 27:08.728
Grandma Spade,
and Grandad Spade in Heaven.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.129
Amen.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.398
Amen.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.834
Ace, pass
the smushy rice, please.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.670
Thomas, your grandad
isn't in Heaven.

27:17.703 --> 27:20.940
He's in hell where people go
when they kill themselves.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.276
What do you mean?

27:24.310 --> 27:26.345
Uh, I don't think Thomas
needs to hear this right now.

27:26.379 --> 27:28.814
He needs to hear what happens
to folks who kill themselves.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.883
Hey, Mom, please, come on.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.318
Please lie to him about hell?

27:32.351 --> 27:34.320
In the Bible,
Judas killed himself,

27:34.353 --> 27:36.022
and Judas isn't in Heaven,
I can assure you of that.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.957
Hey, buddy, how's, uh--
how's little league going?

27:37.990 --> 27:39.825
-I'm playing third base.
-Third base?

27:39.859 --> 27:41.994
Your granddad is on fire
for eternity.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.329
That's what happens
when you give up.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.998
-God gives up on you.
-Damn it, Carol, enough!

27:52.438 --> 27:55.141
Where are you going?

27:55.174 --> 27:57.309
I got to work.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.451
Please sit.

28:05.684 --> 28:09.088
Dad's, uh, burning flesh
kind of ruined my appetite.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.902
Yeah, I mean, my parents
are always telling me,

28:22.935 --> 28:25.071
"Just stay the course, Bobby."

28:25.104 --> 28:27.807
It's like, man,
sometimes I wish life was like

28:27.840 --> 28:29.375
Mario Kart or something,
where the course

28:29.408 --> 28:30.910
is just up in the corner,
you know?

28:30.943 --> 28:32.078
Yeah, right?

28:32.111 --> 28:34.447
So, when people told you
"stay the course,"

28:34.480 --> 28:35.915
you kind of know what
the course looks like.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.049
-Like, who's in front of you...
-Mm-hmm.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.851
-...who's coming up behind you.
-Mm-hmm.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.253
Okay, I would always play
as Toad.

28:41.287 --> 28:43.489
-Who were you?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.392
-Diddy Kong.
-Okay, fair, I love Diddy Kong.

28:48.794 --> 28:50.229
Crystal, thank you
for helping me.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.831
I mean, really, thank you.

28:51.864 --> 28:54.133
Yeah, I love this stuff.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.469
-It's--it's fun, you know?
-Mm-hmm.

28:56.502 --> 28:59.105
You know, when you--
when you asked me to, um,

28:59.138 --> 29:00.773
come to your Airstream earlier,

29:00.806 --> 29:03.442
I thought you were gonna, like,
make a move on me or something.

29:03.476 --> 29:06.045
-What, like a dance move?

29:06.078 --> 29:08.047
I can moonwalk
pretty good, actually.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.448
-It's hard in the boots.

29:09.482 --> 29:11.984
Yeah, by pretty good,
you mean pretty bad?

29:12.017 --> 29:13.419
-Bobby Pin.
-Hey.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.221
-Can I get a selfie?
-Yeah.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.089
-Uh, can I hand you this?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.125
-Thanks.
-Wait. Crystal, you too.

29:19.158 --> 29:21.193
Uh, you know what?
My hands are a little full.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.928
I'll get ya at the Dome,
all right?

29:22.962 --> 29:24.396
-Hey, we'll do one with us.
-Awesome.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.800
Ready? Let's do one,
big muscles, okay?

29:27.833 --> 29:29.401
-Okay.
-Here we go, big muscles.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.304
Yeah.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.873
Thanks, guys. High five.

29:33.906 --> 29:36.509
All right, thanks a lot.
Y'all come to the Dome, okay?

29:36.542 --> 29:38.978
-I will.
-I'll see you there.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.013
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.318
You're gonna be a great face.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.987
Thanks.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.022
Ace loved being a face,

29:50.055 --> 29:53.392
but he wasn't so good
at turning on his smile.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.395
But I guess now
he won't have to.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.371
Hey, bud.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.040
Thanks for letting me
take your bed, Uncle Ace.

30:08.073 --> 30:11.277
All good, little man.
You can't sleep?

30:11.310 --> 30:13.913
Thinking of granddad on fire.

30:15.447 --> 30:17.049
He ain't on fire.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.584
Grandma says he is.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.419
Well, grandparents
don't know everything.

30:20.452 --> 30:21.987
She said it was in the Bible.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.355
She should reread it.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.024
Should I tell her that?

30:25.057 --> 30:26.492
You should not.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.265
You know,
adults know a lot more

30:33.299 --> 30:35.367
about some stuff than kids.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.304
But no one...

30:38.337 --> 30:40.239
and I mean no one

30:40.272 --> 30:43.342
knows what happens
after you die.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.311
So, whenever someone says
that they do,

30:45.344 --> 30:47.880
all you got to do is nod.

30:47.913 --> 30:50.149
You don't got to agree
or disagree.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.283
Just nod.

30:51.317 --> 30:54.353
-Isn't a nod a yes?
-Sometimes.

30:54.386 --> 30:57.423
Sometimes a nod is just a way
to end a conversation

30:57.456 --> 31:00.092
you don't want to keep having.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.327
You understand?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.366
That's my nephew.

31:09.134 --> 31:12.204
Uncle Ace, who cleaned him up

31:12.238 --> 31:15.040
after he killed himself,

31:15.074 --> 31:18.177
when he was--
when he was laying there?

31:23.115 --> 31:25.451
Your daddy
cleaned him up real good.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.921
Did Daddy cry when he saw him?

31:28.954 --> 31:31.490
I wasn't there.
I was with Grandma.

31:31.523 --> 31:34.026
Was Grandma sad?

31:34.059 --> 31:35.527
She's still sad.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.631
She seems mad.

31:38.664 --> 31:42.134
Sometimes that's the way
sad comes out.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.069
Why did he do it?

31:45.904 --> 31:48.107
His spirit got broken.

31:48.140 --> 31:50.442
How did his spirit get broken?

31:56.649 --> 31:59.485
Hey, I heard somebody
needs a new blanket.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.422
Why don't you try
this one on for size?

32:03.455 --> 32:06.358
It's a nice Georgia Bulldogs
blanket for you.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.193
-Are you serious?

32:08.227 --> 32:10.496
Just don't let your daddy
put out any fires with it.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.965
I love you, Uncle Ace.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.134
Back at you, bud.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.069
Sleep loose.

32:22.374 --> 32:25.110
All right,
just tell me when to go.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.513
I'm sorry. Now?
Don't fuck with me.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.481
Now? All right,
is that frame okay?

32:29.515 --> 32:31.250
-All right.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.285
Thank you for giving up
your bed.

32:33.319 --> 32:36.188
Thomas should be down here.

32:36.221 --> 32:39.058
Basement's scary, even now.

32:40.326 --> 32:43.629
-You watching old DWL shit?
-Yeah.

32:43.662 --> 32:46.465
I cut a promo today
where I challenged The Rock.

32:47.666 --> 32:51.070
-The Rock?
-The Rock.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.338
The Rock The Rock?

32:52.371 --> 32:53.672
The Rock The Rock, yeah.

32:53.706 --> 32:56.041
I thought maybe it gets shared
on social media.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.309
He sees it, comes down,

32:57.343 --> 33:00.045
plays with us,
and helps put us on the map.

33:00.079 --> 33:02.081
Like one of those videos
where the nerdy kid

33:02.114 --> 33:03.482
asks Taylor Swift
to go to prom with him?

33:03.515 --> 33:05.718
When you put it that way, yeah.

33:09.221 --> 33:12.224
-Young Wild Bill.
-Mm-hmm.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.529
Look at all that hair.

33:19.365 --> 33:22.234
I've got news for you,
little half-wit!

33:22.267 --> 33:24.536
-"Little half-wit."
-You ain't in for no treat!

33:24.570 --> 33:29.007
Just a good old-fashioned
ass-whupping!

33:31.243 --> 33:32.578
So fucking cheesy.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.513
It was innovative.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.749
They were innovators.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.251
Now it's just been done
to death.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.222
Long live the king, baby!

33:49.495 --> 33:52.197
Did we get it?

33:52.231 --> 33:54.400
Don't make me
do that shit again.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.076
Do you think Dad's in hell?

34:04.109 --> 34:05.544
You didn't listen to mom
your entire life,

34:05.577 --> 34:08.147
and you're just
gonna start now?

34:14.453 --> 34:17.589
You seen, uh,
Florida Dystopia's promos?

34:17.623 --> 34:19.191
They're the ones
where Charlie Gully

34:19.224 --> 34:21.760
lights people on fire,
and they chant "fuck the DWL."

34:21.794 --> 34:23.495
Yeah, I seen those a few times.

34:23.529 --> 34:27.199
I'm just saying, you know,
they--they look like movies,

34:27.232 --> 34:29.201
not like--not like these.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.803
I want to use something
like that, something cinematic.

34:30.836 --> 34:32.805
I didn't call you down here
for notes on creative.

34:32.838 --> 34:34.373
-All right?
-Ah, right, I forgot.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.741
Yeah, you got it
all figured out.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.576
You know, I was with Wild Bill
this afternoon,

34:37.609 --> 34:39.144
and all I kept thinking
to myself was,

34:39.178 --> 34:40.612
"Do I have to tell Jack
about this?"

34:40.646 --> 34:43.148
And, "Is Jack gonna be angry
at me for doing this?"

34:43.182 --> 34:46.185
Like you're my fucking dad.
I mean damn it, Jack.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.587
Why do you have to control
everything all the time?

34:48.620 --> 34:51.123
Because I'm the one that's
creating things all the time.

34:53.358 --> 34:55.327
How was good old Wild Bill?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.629
Maybe I should pay him
a visit,

34:57.663 --> 35:00.432
get some tips on how
to completely fuck up my life.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.668
Do you have to be an asshole
to be a heel?

35:02.701 --> 35:04.269
Are you asking,

35:04.303 --> 35:06.104
or are you calling me
an asshole?

35:07.806 --> 35:09.408
No.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.543
You do not have to be
an asshole to be a heel.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.712
You got to be able to take
the heat if you're a heel,

35:13.745 --> 35:15.614
and you need to learn
how to separate

35:15.647 --> 35:17.816
you the character
from you the person.

35:17.850 --> 35:21.520
You cannot take
this shit home with you.

35:21.553 --> 35:23.722
And when you're starting out...

35:25.591 --> 35:28.393
...that is easier said
than done.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.568
All right, Mr. Tarantino.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.604
You want to help me
with this or what?

35:38.637 --> 35:40.906
-Yeah.
-Okay.

35:44.877 --> 35:47.346
Really?

35:50.382 --> 35:53.519
-Prepare to be amazed.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.937
How's Georgia? They give you
the old hero's welcome?

36:12.170 --> 36:13.539
Always.

36:13.572 --> 36:16.241
So what's up?

36:16.275 --> 36:18.176
Figured y'all are calling
'cause you want to get me back

36:18.210 --> 36:21.179
in front of the cameras again.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.781
No, no, no, I'm just playing.

36:22.814 --> 36:25.717
Hey, look, when I said
"corporate cunts,"

36:25.751 --> 36:27.419
I wasn't referring to you.

36:27.452 --> 36:29.388
Bill, the blowback's
considerable.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.323
Well, I'm not surprised.

36:31.356 --> 36:33.325
You see me with my pants off,
it's gonna--

36:33.358 --> 36:34.560
it's gonna cause a stir.

36:34.593 --> 36:36.194
Yeah, well--

36:36.228 --> 36:38.297
You didn't hire me to act
the fucking saint, Maria.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.965
No, but we letting you go.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.235
Thank you for everything
you've done for us, really.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.939
That's just about
the most insincere thing

36:46.972 --> 36:49.875
I ever heard
in my fucking life.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.603
Dude, you have a trampoline.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.304
That is very sick.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.406
-It's so old.
-Yeah, exactly.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.375
It doesn't have the stupid
net cages on the side

37:23.408 --> 37:24.610
to keep you
from falling out of it,

37:24.643 --> 37:27.579
so it's, like,
perfect for practicing.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.550
Oh, uh, do you have a bathroom?

37:33.352 --> 37:34.553
Uh, for the costume.

37:34.586 --> 37:35.821
I brought the costume with me,
to try it on.

37:35.854 --> 37:38.357
Oh, yeah, right.
Uh, yeah, just right there.

37:38.390 --> 37:41.393
Yeah? Okay, thanks.
Here comes Bobby '85!

37:45.697 --> 37:47.366
Hey, how's it looking in there?

37:47.399 --> 37:48.867
Awesome.
By the way, I'm gonna tell

37:48.900 --> 37:50.902
Jack and Willie that
my gimmick was your idea.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.839
Uh, no, you--you really
don't have to do that.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.707
Well, you deserve
the credit, Crystal.

37:55.741 --> 37:56.942
I mean, if they want to cut me

37:56.975 --> 37:58.677
just 'cause I needed help,
fuck it.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.880
Bobby, for real,
just--just don't.

38:01.913 --> 38:06.018
I'm--I'm just a valet.
I got to fly low right now.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.420
Dude...

38:08.453 --> 38:11.456
I will respect your wishes,
but you are not just a valet.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.059
You are super smart,
and you're really talented,

38:14.292 --> 38:15.827
and, yeah, the people
at the top may not see it,

38:15.861 --> 38:17.829
but we do.

38:17.863 --> 38:21.800
You're the one that should be
getting the push, all right?

38:24.970 --> 38:26.538
Come on.

38:27.706 --> 38:31.009
Now, tell me...

38:31.043 --> 38:33.412
how's my costume?

38:37.983 --> 38:39.551
You know...

38:41.319 --> 38:44.356
...I think
you shouldn't be Bobby '85.

38:44.389 --> 38:45.991
I think you should be
Bobby Pin.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.795
I told you,
I don't know who that is.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.830
Well, I do.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.965
He's a good guy,

38:53.999 --> 38:56.702
just a real good guy.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.971
I think that's enough
of a gimmick.

39:00.005 --> 39:01.873
What do I dress as, then?

39:01.907 --> 39:04.676
Just be you...

39:04.710 --> 39:06.745
and a little less
like Liberace.

39:10.482 --> 39:12.584
You get this text from Jack?

39:12.617 --> 39:14.119
We're shooting a promo?

39:19.424 --> 39:21.827
Hmm. Bobby Pin.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.128
Toast of Duffy, I hear.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.629
Crystal, I'm not here
for trouble.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.832
I just want some Code Red
Mountain Dew, all right?

39:26.865 --> 39:29.401
Would you look what the cat
puked out of her gizzard?

39:29.434 --> 39:30.902
Oh! Oh, man. Come on!

39:38.577 --> 39:40.011
Come on, man. Come on, man.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.813
What's the problem?
Oh, God, Ace, it's cold.

39:41.847 --> 39:43.381
Come on, Bobby.
Come on, Bobby.

39:43.415 --> 39:45.717
Finish him off, baby!

39:45.751 --> 39:48.620
You bet ya, honeybee.

39:48.653 --> 39:51.523
Come on, man. Come on, Ace.

39:51.556 --> 39:54.426
Come on, Bobby.
You like those doughnuts?

39:58.597 --> 40:00.098
Get back here, Ace!

40:04.169 --> 40:07.105
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Are you crazy or something?

40:09.508 --> 40:11.576
What is that? You--

40:11.610 --> 40:13.612
Come on, Bobby. Come on, Bobby.

40:31.196 --> 40:34.132
Hey, JV squad! Hey!

40:34.166 --> 40:36.134
All right, if y'all got a score
to settle--

40:36.168 --> 40:37.502
You get off me now!

40:37.536 --> 40:38.937
If y'all got a score to settle,

40:38.970 --> 40:41.606
you gonna do it in my ring
next Sunday night.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.177
And whoever wins, well,
they get a shot at this.

40:46.711 --> 40:47.879
All right. Cut.

40:47.913 --> 40:50.182
Let's see, come on.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.618
-Dude.

40:53.652 --> 40:54.653
-Dude!
-Nice!

40:54.686 --> 40:55.687
-Hey.
-Come on!

40:55.720 --> 40:57.789
This is great. This is great.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.224
Oh, Bobby, you caught my fist

40:59.457 --> 41:01.126
like you're
in the fucking Matrix, man.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.828
And that's your new character?

41:02.861 --> 41:06.031
Yes, uh, it's just me.
I'm a regular guy.

41:07.699 --> 41:10.702
You're a man of the people.
That works for me.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.606
All right. Did we get it?

41:14.639 --> 41:15.907
I mean, I-I'm down to go again.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.509
I could get out
of that truck faster.

41:17.542 --> 41:18.977
We got some beats
we could pick up...

41:19.010 --> 41:20.846
Hey, y'all are paying us
to close down for an hour.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.247
-Let's do it.
-Heck, yeah.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.683
Oh, hey, Crystal, when you
circle us with the ATV,

41:24.716 --> 41:25.817
you know, really make sure

41:25.851 --> 41:27.919
you lay down that rubber, baby,
you know?

41:27.953 --> 41:29.154
You know, and--and, Willie,

41:29.187 --> 41:30.755
really push into
that close-up there, right?

41:30.789 --> 41:32.557
You know, uh, when she's
revving in Bobby's face.

41:32.591 --> 41:34.659
-I think that'll look sick.
-Yeah, yeah, I can do that.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.795
Yeah, it doesn't sound
dangerous at all.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.064
-Don't you run me over.

41:39.097 --> 41:40.966
Get your dry clothes on,
get cleaned up.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.134
-We'll go again.
-Hey, Jack.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.570
-Yeah?
-Do cats have gizzards?

41:45.604 --> 41:47.606
Fuck, no, cats ain't got
no damn gizzards.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.708
And make sure you blow-dry
your hair before the next take.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.710
Yeah, and get some mousse
on it, too, yo.

41:51.743 --> 41:55.213
-It sounds good. Keep it in.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.818
Look at him, he's
still thinking about the shit.

42:01.119 --> 42:02.787
Wear that outfit again.

42:02.821 --> 42:04.155
It's so dumb, dude.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.690
It's the best
outfit you ever seen.

42:05.724 --> 42:06.825
Don't--don't do it, man.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.661
-Sweet car.
-Oh, hey, thanks, bro.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.296
And, hey, thanks a lot
for the opportunity, man.

42:11.529 --> 42:13.765
-I-I appreciate it.
-Yeah, man.

42:13.798 --> 42:17.903
-It's fun being the bad guy.

42:17.936 --> 42:21.306
Hey, uh, can I talk to you
for a sec?

42:21.539 --> 42:22.607
Yeah.

42:27.212 --> 42:31.616
I just wanted to say, uh...

42:31.650 --> 42:34.019
uh, you did awesome.

42:35.921 --> 42:37.822
So did you.

42:37.856 --> 42:39.557
You're a great heel.

42:39.591 --> 42:42.694
Yeah, I mean,
it's just about separating

42:42.727 --> 42:45.030
the guy
from the character, I think.

42:47.799 --> 42:52.304
Hey, you want to go
for a bite and celebrate

42:52.337 --> 42:54.606
our first cinematic promo?

42:56.608 --> 42:57.976
That sounds delicious,

42:58.009 --> 43:00.812
but I got to work
a shift here now.

43:00.845 --> 43:03.014
Oh, right.

43:03.048 --> 43:06.651
Right, yeah. Uh, word.

43:06.685 --> 43:08.853
Uh, well, hit me up.

43:10.622 --> 43:13.792
Yeah, I'll, uh...

43:13.825 --> 43:15.026
hit you up.

43:16.628 --> 43:17.796
Okay.

43:19.998 --> 43:22.367
Nice work, ladies.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.203
-Be good.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.739
Good luck
with them cat gizzards.

43:31.209 --> 43:32.844
-Hey, Carol.
-Oh.

43:32.877 --> 43:34.112
Oh, sorry.

43:34.145 --> 43:35.914
I didn't mean to scare you.
We're headed home.

43:35.947 --> 43:37.983
Well, uh, Thomas' socks
are in the dryer.

43:38.016 --> 43:39.818
I got 'em. Thank you.

43:41.186 --> 43:43.188
Listen, I'm sorry
about what happened

43:43.221 --> 43:44.923
the other night at dinner.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.791
You've been through a lot,
and I know with the anniversary

43:46.825 --> 43:48.193
of Tom coming up, it must be--

43:48.226 --> 43:49.861
Please, let's not call it that.

43:49.894 --> 43:52.630
It's, uh--it's not
a red-letter calendar day.

43:54.866 --> 43:56.735
I was about to say
I don't mean to pry,

43:56.768 --> 43:58.269
but I guess that's something
people only say

43:58.303 --> 44:00.939
-before they start prying.

44:00.972 --> 44:03.208
But I--

44:03.241 --> 44:06.678
I want to pry because
I want to know how you feel...

44:06.711 --> 44:08.646
uh, how you felt.

44:08.680 --> 44:10.648
You know, I've been thinking
a lot lately,

44:10.682 --> 44:13.385
and, well, we've never
really talked all that much,

44:13.418 --> 44:16.821
and I've been married
to your son nine years now.

44:19.057 --> 44:22.694
So, if you ever want to talk
about things sometime...

44:24.696 --> 44:27.132
Tom always had to drive.

44:27.165 --> 44:29.868
When--whenever we went
anywhere, uh, on a trip,

44:29.901 --> 44:31.669
to a show,
even to the grocery store,

44:31.703 --> 44:34.039
he never let me drive.

44:34.072 --> 44:37.709
Uh, and I tell you,
I get into a car now,

44:37.742 --> 44:40.245
and I barely know what to do.

44:40.278 --> 44:42.380
I'm scared,

44:42.414 --> 44:44.749
and I used to love to drive.

44:46.051 --> 44:48.319
But now I just let Ace
take me everywhere, and...

44:50.455 --> 44:52.090
...and sometimes
I think about that,

44:52.123 --> 44:54.926
and I just get so mad.

44:57.362 --> 45:00.098
And I guess
that's why I say things.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.971
I-I find that anger
is more useful than grief.

45:08.907 --> 45:10.742
I understand that.

45:10.775 --> 45:12.744
I've felt that.

45:12.777 --> 45:15.447
No one can step
into my loss for me,

45:15.480 --> 45:17.916
and that's probably
why talking about the past

45:17.949 --> 45:20.952
makes me so mad.

45:20.985 --> 45:22.720
Uh, enough of that.

45:22.754 --> 45:24.956
You better get going,
before it gets too late.

45:24.989 --> 45:26.458
All right, well,
I'm gonna hug you.

45:41.172 --> 45:44.275
You ever keep that thing
in your pants?

45:44.309 --> 45:46.978
-It was created to be shared.

45:47.011 --> 45:49.380
Not by my neighbors, dumbass.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.418
You got a cigarette?

46:14.339 --> 46:16.875
You got shitcanned, didn't you?

46:18.109 --> 46:20.845
It was a mutual parting
of the ways.

46:26.351 --> 46:28.052
Heard Ted and Robin talking

46:28.086 --> 46:30.321
about some promo
you all shot today.

46:30.355 --> 46:31.556
Oh, yeah.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.224
I guess
it wouldn't have made sense

46:33.258 --> 46:35.326
to have me there, would it?

46:35.360 --> 46:37.996
I can't imagine
what a star of my profile

46:38.029 --> 46:41.466
could possibly add
to your Podunk operation.

46:41.499 --> 46:43.268
Jack's operation.

46:43.301 --> 46:44.502
Fuck that little punk.

46:44.536 --> 46:46.971
He's the reason
Tom killed hisself.

46:47.005 --> 46:49.274
-Easy.
-You know it.

46:49.307 --> 46:52.911
Can't pin that on me.

46:52.944 --> 46:54.846
Oh, you think I fucked that up,

46:54.879 --> 46:57.949
like I fuck everything up,
like I fucked my whole life up?

46:57.982 --> 47:01.219
I see you looking down
your nose at me.

47:01.252 --> 47:02.921
Let me tell you something.

47:02.954 --> 47:04.589
Your life ain't so perfect.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.859
-I didn't say it was.
-You and wiener Ted.

47:09.093 --> 47:11.296
The guy knows
I used to tag his wife,

47:11.329 --> 47:13.264
yet he still lets me
in his home.

47:13.298 --> 47:15.867
And that daughter
you can't fucking stand.

47:15.900 --> 47:17.869
Too bad I wasn't around

47:17.902 --> 47:19.571
to pay for that abortion, too.

47:21.439 --> 47:22.440
Go on!

47:24.275 --> 47:26.511
Piece of fucking shit.
Fuck you!

47:32.550 --> 47:35.520
You didn't move
a fucking muscle.

47:37.422 --> 47:39.591
That's why you're the greatest.

48:04.649 --> 48:07.085
What the hell
are you doing, man?

48:09.120 --> 48:12.924
The hotel
by the interstate's got rooms.

48:12.957 --> 48:17.328
Free breakfast,
all the syrup you can eat.

48:17.362 --> 48:19.364
Bye, Bill.

48:46.958 --> 48:49.494
Ah!

48:49.527 --> 48:51.396
I thought you said
you knew how to jump.

48:51.429 --> 48:52.664
-Come on.
-I do!

48:52.697 --> 48:54.132
-Let's see it.
-Oh, no.

48:54.165 --> 48:55.466
-Here we go, ready?
-Okay.

48:55.500 --> 48:58.336
I'll jump you.
One, two, three.

48:58.369 --> 49:00.505
-Okay. Oh, sorry.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.407
-That was pretty good.
-You did not save me.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.175
-Here you go.
-Aah!

49:04.208 --> 49:06.311
Good? You good?
I got you, I got you.

49:06.344 --> 49:07.679
-Yeah, thanks.
-Oh, hey!

49:07.712 --> 49:09.347
Oh, right in the ribs.
What was that? Come on.

49:09.380 --> 49:12.984
-No, no, no.

49:13.017 --> 49:15.386
Can we do that again?
Oh, come on.

49:15.420 --> 49:17.055
I mean, I think--
I think that might have been

49:17.088 --> 49:18.523
the highest bounce we ever got.

49:20.058 --> 49:22.560
Hey, when do you want
to get some ice cream again?

49:22.593 --> 49:25.096
Oh, man, look,
I-I just been thinking

49:25.129 --> 49:29.434
that we probably shouldn't be
seen out in public together.

49:29.467 --> 49:33.204
Ace's valet hanging out
with Ace's rival...

49:33.237 --> 49:35.039
I think Jack might kill us.

49:35.073 --> 49:38.176
Yeah, I guess we'll just have
to hang out here, then, huh?

49:40.111 --> 49:42.347
Oh, shit.

49:42.380 --> 49:44.415
What the--

49:44.449 --> 49:47.385
Somebody keyed my Bronco.

49:47.418 --> 49:49.420
What the fuck?

49:50.655 --> 49:54.158
I don't know, it kind of looks
like a racing stripe, huh?

50:00.198 --> 50:02.200
Ahh.

50:05.737 --> 50:08.606
How's my baby boy?

50:08.639 --> 50:12.009
Not feeling too hot
right now, Mama.

50:12.043 --> 50:14.045
You can tell me why.

50:14.078 --> 50:17.281
Just, uh, feeling
a bit blue is all.

50:17.315 --> 50:19.217
Well, don't wallow.

50:19.250 --> 50:21.152
Your daddy indulged
his blue moods,

50:21.185 --> 50:23.121
got to liking 'em too much.

50:23.154 --> 50:26.791
Mama, Daddy was mixed up,
so he checked out.

50:28.593 --> 50:30.261
But he ain't in hell.

50:31.596 --> 50:33.431
He just ain't here.

50:36.134 --> 50:38.336
Judas betrayed the Lord.
Daddy wasn't no Judas.

50:38.369 --> 50:40.138
I'm sure God
must have known that.

50:44.342 --> 50:46.344
I hear the gunshot...

50:48.446 --> 50:51.282
...over and over again,

50:51.315 --> 50:53.317
especially if it's quiet.

50:57.722 --> 51:00.191
It's been almost a year.

51:00.224 --> 51:01.526
I'm aware.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.795
I can't sleep without music.

51:05.129 --> 51:07.298
When it's quiet,
I hear the sound.

51:07.331 --> 51:10.768
Ace, not every feeling
deserves our extra attention.

51:10.802 --> 51:14.305
Sadness sometimes,
it can be selfish.

51:14.338 --> 51:16.307
Sadness only thinks
about itself.

51:16.340 --> 51:18.709
Mama, that may sound
real interesting to somebody

51:18.743 --> 51:21.112
who don't think about it,
and maybe it's helpful,

51:21.145 --> 51:23.314
but sadness...

51:23.347 --> 51:26.284
it ain't like
its own thing, you know?

51:26.317 --> 51:31.088
It's--it's not like its own
being with its own will.

51:31.122 --> 51:34.792
Sadness is there
so you- you listen to it,

51:34.826 --> 51:36.794
so you sort through it.

51:36.828 --> 51:38.496
That's why it's there.

51:40.231 --> 51:41.399
You stopped smiling

51:41.432 --> 51:44.302
way before Daddy did
what he did to himself.

51:44.335 --> 51:45.403
Why?

51:46.737 --> 51:48.539
I think maybe
if you took the time

51:48.573 --> 51:49.841
to answer that question
yourself,

51:49.874 --> 51:52.210
you may be well on your way
to being happy again.

52:13.865 --> 52:17.602
Hey, let me put you
on speaker.

52:17.635 --> 52:19.470
Sorry that I'm late.

52:19.504 --> 52:21.539
I just, uh, got an errand
to run, and I'll be right home.

52:21.572 --> 52:24.442
Willie kicked Wild Bill out,
and I got to stop by his motel

52:24.475 --> 52:26.244
and tell him
to stay away from Ace.

52:26.277 --> 52:28.679
No, that's all right.
How was your day?

52:28.713 --> 52:29.847
I sold two riding mowers,

52:29.881 --> 52:31.349
stopped by the Dome--
usual bullshit.

52:31.382 --> 52:32.850
How was yours?

52:32.884 --> 52:35.720
I got a job
at the grocery store,

52:35.753 --> 52:37.622
just helping out part-time.

52:42.593 --> 52:45.463
I know it's not the most
glamorous thing, but...

52:48.366 --> 52:51.802
I look at your mom,
and I love her, Jack.

52:51.836 --> 52:54.805
I-I really do, but...

52:54.839 --> 52:56.574
I don't want the only thing
I'm good at

52:56.607 --> 52:58.576
to be sewing costumes
for the DWL

52:58.609 --> 53:00.244
and knowing
what brand of flour to buy

53:00.278 --> 53:01.879
for fried chicken, you know?

53:01.913 --> 53:03.881
It's a grocery store, Staci.

53:03.915 --> 53:07.885
I mean, well, yeah,
but I don't know.

53:07.919 --> 53:11.389
I want to go back to school
eventually, I think.

53:11.422 --> 53:14.392
But this is something.

53:14.425 --> 53:17.662
And I need something, Jack.

53:20.765 --> 53:23.434
If you want to work,
I want you to work.

53:25.303 --> 53:26.704
I just want you to be happy.

53:26.737 --> 53:28.272
Me too.

53:29.640 --> 53:32.944
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

53:32.977 --> 53:34.946
I'll see you
when you get home.

53:41.285 --> 53:44.855
Oh, Ace, that feels so good.

53:44.889 --> 53:47.992
Stop talking.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.962
I forgot
you're the bad guy now.

53:50.995 --> 53:53.297
-Oh!
-Fuck, yeah, I am.

53:53.331 --> 53:55.933
-Yeah, baby.
-Ah!

54:01.472 --> 54:04.775
My dad always used to say,

54:04.809 --> 54:07.244
"Hold it together."

54:09.380 --> 54:13.551
"Hold it together, Ace.
Hold it together."

54:19.523 --> 54:20.992
I'm trying.

54:23.260 --> 54:25.963
That's so sad.

54:25.997 --> 54:27.632
Do you want to go again?

54:32.837 --> 54:33.904
Yeah.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.559
How you doing, Dwayne?

54:55.593 --> 54:56.861
Hey, Jack. How's it going?

54:56.894 --> 54:58.663
Good, thank you.
Where's Wild Bill?

54:58.696 --> 55:01.332
-Room 190.
-Thank you, Dwayne.

55:13.344 --> 55:14.912
Ah! Damn it!

55:22.353 --> 55:23.487
Fuck!

56:20.444 --> 56:22.079
Fuck, yeah.

56:22.113 --> 56:24.682
I am Wild Bill Hancock,

56:24.715 --> 56:27.818
and I am here!

56:27.852 --> 56:30.821
I am alive!

56:33.023 --> 56:36.460
Wake the fuck up, y'all!

56:36.494 --> 56:39.430
Who wants to play?
Who wants to play?

56:40.731 --> 56:45.402
Who wants to play
with Wild Bill?
