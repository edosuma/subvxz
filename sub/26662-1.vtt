Oh good.

05:16.933 --> 05:20.851

at your x-ray

07:03.038 --> 07:06.582

07:06.584 --> 07:07.459
You're right.

I'm gonna quit as soon

Now are you gonna give
me a ride or not?

- Not.
- Why not?

I don't even know you.

to go anyways?

everywhere for you.

Can you give me a cigarette?

08:08.562 --> 08:10.354
- But you said...
- Just give me a cigarette.

08:25.288 --> 08:27.582
So what's up
with the little escape artist?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.251
She's been living in and out

08:33.253 --> 08:35.380
so she tries to escape
every now and then.

to some special place.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.099
Special place?

08:47.642 --> 08:48.518
I don't know.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.272
All I know is that life
is unfair.

08:52.857 --> 08:55.776
You have this sweet little
girl who's chronically ill

08:56.860 --> 08:58.443
and you have murderers
running around

08:58.445 --> 08:59.781
who are in perfect health.

09:06.996 --> 09:10.458
I've already told you I'm
only here to placate my family.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.292
They need to think that
I'm taking steps

09:13.294 --> 09:16.379
to deal with the loss.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.422
And knowing that I'm
seeing a psychiatrist

09:18.424 --> 09:20.591
makes them feel better,

09:20.593 --> 09:25.640
but I'm in no way ready
to talk about my grandson.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.352
Facing his death will
help you move on

09:32.354 --> 09:34.063
and have a productive life.

09:34.065 --> 09:35.481
It's important
for your state of mind

09:35.483 --> 09:37.357
that we face this head on.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.486
That's what I'm here
to help you deal with.

09:41.238 --> 09:44.450
I dealt with my husband's
death three years ago

09:46.076 --> 09:49.955
and I stayed strong for
myself and for my family.

09:51.248 --> 09:53.209
It was difficult but I managed

09:54.334 --> 09:57.379
because that's life,
that's nature.

09:58.422 --> 10:01.550
Almost every wife has to
deal with that at some point,

10:04.887 --> 10:06.888
but losing my grandson,

10:09.809 --> 10:14.564
watching my daughter
suffer unspeakably

10:17.650 --> 10:19.776
at the loss of her little boy.

10:22.780 --> 10:24.323
That's not nature.

10:26.408 --> 10:28.869
That's not how things are
supposed to go.

10:30.872 --> 10:35.918
If it wasn't for those
miserable bastards

10:38.879 --> 10:40.672
he'd still be alive.

10:44.551 --> 10:46.718
Do you know what I was doing

10:46.720 --> 10:48.472
when my daughter
called to tell me?

10:49.556 --> 10:50.432
No.

10:51.600 --> 10:56.272
I was putting in a play
set for him in my backyard.

10:59.525 --> 11:04.572
When that phone rang
I had no idea

11:08.825 --> 11:11.785
of the kind of news
that I would receive.

11:11.787 --> 11:15.248
I honestly didn't know that,

11:20.796 --> 11:24.925
that that kind of pain existed.

11:29.347 --> 11:34.310
The deepest darkest pain

11:36.771 --> 11:41.818
and it's all because of
those filthy animals.

11:43.026 --> 11:46.361
God don't you dare ask me
how that makes me feel.

11:46.363 --> 11:50.073
I swear to God if you
ask me one more time

11:50.075 --> 11:51.701
how something makes me feel...

11:51.703 --> 11:53.077
I don't need to ask.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.039
I can already see
what you're feeling.

11:55.873 --> 11:57.539
I see a lot of grief,

11:57.541 --> 11:59.710
but what I see the
most is anger.

12:00.545 --> 12:04.130
You seem to be fixated on
your hatred for the killers.

12:04.132 --> 12:05.632
That shouldn't be your focus.

12:08.802 --> 12:10.971
It's kind of hard
to ignore, Doctor.

12:11.888 --> 12:13.222
And what do you think
you're going to achieve

12:13.224 --> 12:16.266
by giving these men so much
of your thoughts and energy?

12:16.268 --> 12:18.228
Oh, I can't achieve anything.

12:19.939 --> 12:24.068

and go out and fight crime.

What will she think?

12:51.054 --> 12:53.305
Will she be able to
tell that he's a killer?

13:05.526 --> 13:07.152
So what are you doing here?

13:10.573 --> 13:12.325
I just wanted to
see how you are.

13:17.789 --> 13:20.121
I'm sick every day so...

13:20.123 --> 13:21.792
Isn't it better for you here?

13:22.752 --> 13:24.125
Why did you want to escape?

13:24.127 --> 13:25.961
'Cause we're in Redding.

13:25.963 --> 13:27.545
Where?

13:27.547 --> 13:30.092
Don't you know where we are?

13:31.219 --> 13:32.804
I was a few hours away

13:33.970 --> 13:36.349
and I was just driving
to the nearest hospital.

13:38.309 --> 13:39.142

13:51.656 --> 13:53.074
I was born sick.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.411
I see.

13:58.912 --> 14:00.996
I'd rather have
a short life out there

14:00.998 --> 14:02.541
than a long life in here.

14:05.210 --> 14:06.919

your parents about...

42:06.642 --> 42:08.477
when you come into
work on a Sunday.

42:14.649 --> 42:15.776
Is this your daughter?

42:18.404 --> 42:19.364
She's hot.

42:20.531 --> 42:22.866
Just take what you want
and get the hell out of here.

- What we want isn't here.
- What?

42:31.209 --> 42:32.542
MAN WITH FACE COVERED:
We want the safe.

42:34.754 --> 42:36.297
The safe that's at your house.

42:37.881 --> 42:39.299
We know all about it.

42:47.433 --> 42:49.227
Now we have your address.

42:54.732 --> 42:56.901
If you touch my family,
I'll kill you.

No actually,

43:00.404 --> 43:01.363
we'll kill you.

43:08.413 --> 43:11.830
Those security cameras
they're recording all of this.

43:11.832 --> 43:13.917
In the morning the tapes
will be reviewed

43:14.919 --> 43:16.921
and this will all be on there.

That's why we're wearing masks.

drive over to your house.

No.

MAN WITH FACE COVERED:
Let me finish.

43:37.107 --> 43:39.357
He's gonna go over
to your house,

43:39.359 --> 43:40.734
you're gonna call them,

43:40.736 --> 43:43.404
your daughter, your wife,
whoever's home

43:43.406 --> 43:45.656
and tell them to
calmly let him in

43:45.658 --> 43:47.449
and open the safe for him.

43:47.451 --> 43:49.701
That won't work, they
don't have the combination.

43:49.703 --> 43:52.288

But you do.

43:52.290 --> 43:54.000
That's why God created phones.

43:55.292 --> 43:57.752
You can call them,
keep them calm.

43:57.754 --> 44:00.129
Tell them that everything's
gonna be okay

44:00.131 --> 44:02.507
if they follow our instructions.

44:05.678 --> 44:06.971
I won't do it.

44:08.806 --> 44:10.013
MAN WITH FACE COVERED:
Well in that case,

44:10.015 --> 44:12.141
my friend is gonna go
over to your house

44:12.143 --> 44:17.187
and torture whoever's home
and he'll have his phone on

44:17.189 --> 44:20.108
so you can hear
every agonizing scream.

44:22.736 --> 44:24.613
Why are you doing this?

44:25.448 --> 44:26.908
MAN WITH FACE COVERED:
We want your money.

44:28.408 --> 44:29.660
And maybe your daughter.

44:30.620 --> 44:33.328
You see we have your address
so this is gonna happen

44:33.330 --> 44:36.291
- one way or the other.
- No please, don't.

44:37.167 --> 44:38.169
Okey-dokey then.

he gets there.

it was around here,

out here just to help me?

looking for exactly?

Oh it's a silver cross.

It was my grandmother's and
she passed it down to my dad

53:53.015 --> 53:54.433

was really rebellious

here one night

was such an idiot.

see this and, you know,

01:23:22.410 --> 01:23:25.201
So have as you guys may know

01:23:25.203 --> 01:23:27.079
Redding is the second
sunniest city

01:23:27.081 --> 01:23:28.748
in the whole United States.

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.958
It's the sunniest city
in California.

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.585
We also have the most
fun attractions right?

01:23:33.587 --> 01:23:34.587
(LAUGHING)

01:23:34.589 --> 01:23:38.173
And so since we live in
such a vacation paradise

01:23:38.175 --> 01:23:42.177
I was thinking that I would
like to take Wolfgang's lead.

01:23:42.179 --> 01:23:43.512
To help people?

01:23:43.514 --> 01:23:45.847
Yeah, that's what
I would like to do.

01:23:45.849 --> 01:23:48.100
And Wolfgang, I don't want
you paying for anything.

01:23:48.102 --> 01:23:50.186
Now that I'm not supporting
my boyfriend anymore

01:23:50.188 --> 01:23:51.561
I can take the three of us out

01:23:51.563 --> 01:23:53.732
and one person who's
in need once a week.

01:23:56.361 --> 01:23:58.696
- Is that why we're here?
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:59.572 --> 01:24:02.448
There's someone in that
house who needs our help.

01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:03.326
Who?

01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:08.370
It's a little boy who was
injured by a drunk driver.

01:24:08.372 --> 01:24:10.873
He's disabled now
and he's lonely.

01:24:10.875 --> 01:24:13.167
He lost both his
parents in a car accident

01:24:13.169 --> 01:24:14.459
and his grandma's too elderly

01:24:14.461 --> 01:24:16.962
to take him out
in his wheelchair.

01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:19.130
So I was thinking that
we could go take him out

01:24:19.132 --> 01:24:22.884
to do some fun activities and
show him that he's not alone.

01:24:22.886 --> 01:24:24.889
- Are you guys with me?
- Yes.

01:24:25.848 --> 01:24:26.724
Yes.

01:24:29.018 --> 01:24:32.477
(PHONE RINGING)

01:24:32.479 --> 01:24:34.732
You two go ahead,
I'll be right there.

01:24:39.237 --> 01:24:40.360
Hello.

01:24:40.362 --> 01:24:43.365
You've given me closure,
Mr. Wolfgang.

01:24:45.033 --> 01:24:47.286
You've also given me
new purpose.

01:24:48.787 --> 01:24:49.663
How so?

01:24:51.916 --> 01:24:56.418
It felt good,
making the world safer

01:24:56.420 --> 01:24:59.798
by doing what we did.

01:25:00.841 --> 01:25:01.718
I agree.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.763
There's a lot of
bad guys out there.

01:25:06.973 --> 01:25:11.267
So many children are falling
victim to violent criminals.

01:25:11.269 --> 01:25:13.396
What do you want
to do about it?

01:25:16.482 --> 01:25:21.110
Well, I've got the money
if you've got the bullets.
