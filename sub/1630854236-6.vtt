WEBVTT

00:25.448 --> 00:28.448
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning.

00:30.448 --> 00:32.827
- Last night was fun.
- Yeah.

00:32.965 --> 00:34.586
And a little weird.

00:34.724 --> 00:36.206
But... I can't believe

00:36.344 --> 00:37.793
Ben never told me
that his family

00:37.931 --> 00:39.793
owns the biggest
barbecue place

00:39.931 --> 00:42.206
- in Waco.
- Yeah.

00:43.689 --> 00:44.965
Where is everybody?

00:45.103 --> 00:46.620
Uh, Daddy said

00:46.758 --> 00:48.103
he was going up
to the farrier in Fort Worth.

00:48.241 --> 00:49.896
I-I guess Mama
was, uh, going with him.

00:50.034 --> 00:51.793
Okay, well, that's great,

00:51.931 --> 00:54.241
because then we can
finally talk, right?

00:54.379 --> 00:56.931
So, Donna,
my new equine therapist,

00:57.068 --> 00:58.448
she has been teaching me
this approach

00:58.586 --> 01:00.379
where you revisit your trauma...

01:00.517 --> 01:03.758
- Liam, about-about that, uh...
- I know, I know. Sounds scary,

01:03.896 --> 01:06.000
especially with
her whole thing being

01:06.137 --> 01:08.482
that you go it alone
for the final steps of recovery,

01:08.620 --> 01:10.758
but with you by my side...

01:10.896 --> 01:12.724
I-I hate to do this, okay,

01:12.862 --> 01:14.965
but right now
is not a good time for me.

01:15.827 --> 01:17.482
I'm not-I'm not brushing off.
I'm not, okay?

01:17.620 --> 01:20.103
I-I... But you-you
got to understand that...

01:20.241 --> 01:22.586
I haven't slept.
I came back last night

01:22.724 --> 01:25.241
to find the Side Step
wrapped in police tape

01:25.379 --> 01:27.034
and my kids in jail.

01:27.172 --> 01:28.862
- Wh...
- Yeah. Stella

01:29.000 --> 01:31.896
threw an underage rager.
At the Side Step, no less.

01:32.034 --> 01:34.137
O-Okay.
No, that sounds bad.

01:34.275 --> 01:37.172
Why don't we get
everything settled.

01:37.310 --> 01:39.068
- And then we can talk.
- Liam,

01:39.206 --> 01:41.482
I-I have to handle this,
- all right? Uh, the-the optics
- Yeah.

01:41.620 --> 01:43.000
with, uh, a Texas Ranger's kids,

01:43.137 --> 01:44.344
- and...
- Hey.

01:44.482 --> 01:45.758
I get it. It's fine.

01:45.896 --> 01:48.551
- I understand. Never mind.
- Hey, well, Liam,

01:48.689 --> 01:51.275
- I-I...
- What the hell
were you thinking,

01:51.413 --> 01:53.103
leaving your daughter in jail?

01:54.896 --> 01:56.827
You bailed her out?

01:56.965 --> 01:58.379
I left her there so she would
learn the consequences

01:58.517 --> 02:00.206
of her actions
now that she's an adult.

02:00.344 --> 02:02.482
- She's 18!
- And she's my daughter.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.310
Stella Blue
needs a wake-up call.

02:04.448 --> 02:06.517
Should I remind you
of her countless

02:06.655 --> 02:08.793
alarming decisions as of late?

02:08.931 --> 02:10.413
I am not disagreeing,
but did you even bother

02:10.551 --> 02:12.344
to listen to
her side of it before

02:12.482 --> 02:13.896
leaving her in the drunk tank?

02:14.034 --> 02:15.517
I didn't leave her
in the drunk tank, Mama.

02:15.655 --> 02:17.275
I had the sergeant separate her.

02:17.413 --> 02:18.862
So I guess you didn't bother to

02:19.000 --> 02:20.862
- listen to my side
either, did you?
- Your side?

02:21.000 --> 02:23.379
- Unbelievable.
- Well, believe it.
Because I'm not

02:23.517 --> 02:25.862
interested in hearing
your lies anymore.

02:33.379 --> 02:34.965
She would have been released
after 24 hours

02:35.103 --> 02:36.517
on a personal
recognizance bond,

02:36.655 --> 02:38.827
but now I have to
deal with this as well.

02:38.965 --> 02:40.103
Thank you so much for

02:40.241 --> 02:41.310
- undermining my parenting.
- Cordell.

02:41.448 --> 02:42.586
Once...
Mama, I will handle

02:42.724 --> 02:44.379
Stella.
This is work.

02:44.517 --> 02:46.310
- Excuse me.
- Oh...

02:46.448 --> 02:48.241
- Cassie.
<i>- Hey, bud. I'm really sorry</i>

02:48.379 --> 02:50.275
about everything with the kids.

02:50.413 --> 02:52.862
Uh, it-it's a quiet day
at the office today,

02:53.000 --> 02:55.689
and after everything
you did for me yesterday,

02:55.827 --> 02:57.448
why don't you take the day off
and deal with the fam, huh?

02:57.586 --> 02:58.931
<i>That would actually be</i>

02:59.068 --> 03:00.517
a big, big help.

03:00.655 --> 03:02.827
Wait, how-how did you...
how did you know about Stella?

03:05.586 --> 03:07.206
Never mind.
Uh, Cassie, thank you.

03:07.344 --> 03:09.758
<i>- Talk later.</i>
- Yeah. Sounds good.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.724
So, uh, meddling in my work
now, too. Wonderful.

03:13.862 --> 03:15.448
Okay, you need
take it down a notch

03:15.586 --> 03:16.965
and you need to hear
your daughter out.

03:17.103 --> 03:19.448
Respectfully, there's only
one person in this house

03:19.586 --> 03:20.931
who I need to hear out.

03:25.482 --> 03:27.241
Stinker, wait.

03:27.379 --> 03:29.241
Hey, hey, hold on, hold on.

03:29.379 --> 03:30.482
I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

03:30.620 --> 03:31.655
This is important to you,

03:31.793 --> 03:33.517
and it's important to me too.

03:33.655 --> 03:36.586
Let's do it.
Yeah?

03:37.931 --> 03:39.965
All right.
I'll meet you in the truck.

03:40.103 --> 03:41.896
Okay.

03:47.586 --> 03:49.965
I'm so glad Abeline
asked me to call her son.

03:50.103 --> 03:52.586
It's rewarding knowing
that my puppet mastering

03:52.724 --> 03:55.103
prevented his family
from falling apart.

03:55.241 --> 03:56.620
Mm-hmm.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.551
How long do you think
before your mom calls me

03:58.689 --> 04:00.206
to puppet master your problems?

04:00.344 --> 04:02.172
You're tripping.

04:02.310 --> 04:03.827
Am I?

04:03.965 --> 04:06.241
I seem to recall
at your badge ceremony,

04:06.379 --> 04:07.931
she asked me if I'd seen
any lady friends

04:08.068 --> 04:09.241
dropping by your apartment.

04:09.379 --> 04:11.206
- Nah, that didn't happen.
- But it did.

04:11.344 --> 04:14.241
So, technically, she already
called upon the puppet master.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.241
And I was happy to oblige.

04:17.103 --> 04:18.620
Although it broke my heart
to inform her

04:18.758 --> 04:20.620
that the number of lady friends

04:20.758 --> 04:24.517
dropping by your apartment
was a big, fat zero.

04:25.758 --> 04:27.413
Keesha and I are concerned.

04:27.551 --> 04:30.310
Why aren't you
getting back out there, hmm?

04:30.448 --> 04:32.172
Boom.

04:32.896 --> 04:35.103
- Is that a dating app?
- Yep.

04:35.241 --> 04:36.206
You just downloaded that.

04:37.827 --> 04:41.689
No. But I will
turn the question on you.

04:41.827 --> 04:43.137
I'm an open book.

04:43.275 --> 04:46.206
Look, don't you think
you broached this topic

04:46.344 --> 04:49.241
because a part of you
is reticent to start dating?

04:49.379 --> 04:50.862
What do you want to hear?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.896
That I yearn
to unwind after work

04:53.034 --> 04:56.000
with a guy who's just as happy
to listen to my woes

04:56.137 --> 04:58.931
as he is to share a beer
watching <i>Hawk's Shadow?</i>

04:59.965 --> 05:02.137
That I want him
to hold my hand and,

05:02.275 --> 05:04.137
with that one simple gesture,

05:04.275 --> 05:07.551
communicate more emotion
than words can convey?

05:07.689 --> 05:10.000
'Cause if that's
who you think I am,

05:10.137 --> 05:11.655
boy, have you got me wrong.

05:11.793 --> 05:14.275
Maybe your hesitation
stems from your last date.

05:14.413 --> 05:18.068
Mm?
- When you were catfished
by the criminal network

05:18.206 --> 05:20.206
that abducted your partner.

05:20.344 --> 05:22.724
I can't imagine
what that does to your trust.

05:22.862 --> 05:26.655
My trust?
I trust people just fine.

05:28.206 --> 05:29.620
Who the hell is that?

05:36.482 --> 05:38.413
Excuse me.

05:38.551 --> 05:39.758
Do you have clearance
to be here?

05:39.896 --> 05:41.931
'Cause I'm not
too keen on civilians

05:42.068 --> 05:43.965
- loitering in front
of my captain's office.
- No...

05:44.103 --> 05:46.413
Oh, no, sorry, uh, Connie
signed me in at reception.

05:46.551 --> 05:48.517
- Yo, Kev! My man!
- Hey.

05:48.655 --> 05:49.620
Trey Money!

05:49.758 --> 05:51.379
Just the man I'm looking for.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.000
What are you doing here?

05:53.137 --> 05:55.000
You two know each other
is what that handshake suggests.

05:55.137 --> 05:56.827
Yeah, uh, Kevin Golden,

05:56.965 --> 05:58.931
this is my friend
Ranger Cassandra Perez.

05:59.068 --> 06:00.344
Ah. It's a pleasure
to meet you, Cassandra.

06:00.482 --> 06:02.310
Uh, Ranger Perez is fine. Oh,

06:02.448 --> 06:03.620
I get one too. Delightful.

06:03.758 --> 06:06.344
Sorry, how do you two...

06:06.482 --> 06:08.551
Uh, my badge dinner
the other night with the mayor.

06:08.689 --> 06:09.896
Kev's the big man's

06:10.034 --> 06:11.482
- chief of staff.
- Oh, a politician.

06:11.620 --> 06:13.689
- I love politicians.
- No, I know.

06:13.827 --> 06:15.413
Don't hold it against me.

06:15.551 --> 06:17.137
Anyway, how lucky
are you to work

06:17.275 --> 06:18.655
- with this guy, Cassandra?
- It's Cassie.

06:18.793 --> 06:20.689
Even the mayor
kept going on and on

06:20.827 --> 06:23.517
about that badass Ranger
with the amazing background.

06:23.655 --> 06:25.931
What is it-- medic,
staff sergeant, therapist,

06:26.068 --> 06:27.689
coach?
What can't this guy do?

06:27.827 --> 06:30.275
- Explain this bond?
- So when I found out

06:30.413 --> 06:31.896
that the mayor's security detail

06:32.034 --> 06:33.793
needed extra coverage
for a fundraising event today,

06:33.931 --> 06:36.068
I thought,
"Mm, who could help?" Bingo.

06:36.206 --> 06:37.862
The mayor called
Captain James himself

06:38.000 --> 06:40.448
to personally request
Ranger-Doctor-Coach Barnett.

06:40.586 --> 06:43.344
Larry and DPS
already signed off on it.

06:43.482 --> 06:45.000
- Are you serious?
- I am serious.

06:45.137 --> 06:47.103
This could be one of those
opportunities, bro.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.413
Oh, opportunities?

06:48.551 --> 06:50.034
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
We were discussing

06:50.172 --> 06:52.689
how crucial it is for us
to rub elbows with policymakers

06:52.827 --> 06:53.827
on Wall Street so that

06:53.965 --> 06:55.172
they can hear about the issues

06:55.310 --> 06:56.827
that we see on main street.

06:56.965 --> 06:59.137
And it doesn't hurt to have
the mayor owe you a favor.

06:59.275 --> 07:01.862
Anyway, this
fundraiser-- it's a bit

07:02.000 --> 07:03.448
on the fancier side.
Not black tie,

07:03.586 --> 07:04.931
but, you know,
security's encouraged

07:05.068 --> 07:06.896
to blend in,
not wear the uniform,

07:07.034 --> 07:08.275
which is fine,
'cause I bet you look

07:08.413 --> 07:09.655
baller in a suit, my man.

07:09.793 --> 07:11.448
- Aw, come on, man.
- You and I are gonna

07:11.586 --> 07:12.724
- have a time!
- Yes, sir.
- Oh,

07:12.862 --> 07:14.482
yes, you will.
You boys

07:14.620 --> 07:16.206
- have fun, now.
- Oh, Cassandra,

07:16.344 --> 07:17.724
no, I'm sorry, I wasn't clear.

07:17.862 --> 07:19.586
You're on
the security detail, too.

07:19.724 --> 07:21.413
But I bet look baller
in a dress.

07:21.551 --> 07:23.551
Which I mean
with all due respect.

07:23.689 --> 07:25.034
- That's how I took it.
- Good.

07:25.172 --> 07:27.965
Okay. I'm out of here,
I will see you there.

07:28.103 --> 07:30.034
Yes, yes, I will see you there.
Awesome, fantastic.

07:30.172 --> 07:32.068
Have a great day, guys.
I'll see you soon.

07:34.379 --> 07:37.586
I'm not sure how practical
a dress is on a security detail.

07:37.724 --> 07:40.206
Yeah, but it'll be baller.

07:40.344 --> 07:42.172
Don't say that.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.206
A list of chores
for August and me?

07:48.344 --> 07:50.344
Can you believe this?

07:50.482 --> 07:52.137
I can, actually.

07:52.275 --> 07:54.000
- What you did was gros...
- What I did?

07:54.931 --> 07:56.793
It was August who
threw the party last night

07:56.931 --> 07:58.137
at the Side Step.
A party

07:58.275 --> 07:59.724
I didn't even know about
until he needed

07:59.862 --> 08:02.137
someone to come rescue him.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.103
Well, you said you blamed Augie.

08:05.241 --> 08:07.413
You never mentioned you were
only there to help him.

08:07.551 --> 08:11.241
He accidentally trapped himself
in the supply closet.

08:12.241 --> 08:15.655
And now I come home to a list
of Dad-mandated chores.

08:15.793 --> 08:17.068
I already got penalized
as an adult,

08:17.206 --> 08:19.413
and now I'm getting
punished like a child.

08:20.448 --> 08:22.241
Your father's a little at sea
on how to handle you.

08:22.379 --> 08:24.689
He's never raised
an 18 year-old before.

08:24.827 --> 08:26.793
No kidding.

08:29.275 --> 08:31.758
I just wish that
he would hear me out

08:31.896 --> 08:33.344
instead of avoiding me.

08:33.482 --> 08:35.206
I don't think
your father's avoiding you.

08:35.344 --> 08:37.724
I feel like he doesn't know
what to do with me anymore

08:37.862 --> 08:41.000
now that I'm off the path
he and Mom expected.

08:42.413 --> 08:43.793
Well...

08:43.931 --> 08:47.586
we're all in uncharted waters
now, aren't we?

08:49.965 --> 08:52.655
Well, it's clear that,
uh, these chores

08:52.793 --> 08:54.206
need to be done
sooner than later.

08:54.344 --> 08:55.551
So, I'll-I'll drop the kids off.

08:55.689 --> 08:57.241
Right now I can't promise
that my rap sheet

08:57.379 --> 09:00.172
won't grow if I'm left alone
with August.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.413
That's fair.

09:02.551 --> 09:03.965
August!
Get the lead out!

09:04.103 --> 09:05.413
Mawline.

09:05.551 --> 09:07.206
Inside voices, please.

09:10.862 --> 09:12.344
Okay, you need to get dressed.

09:12.482 --> 09:14.827
Because your father
wants you and your sister

09:14.965 --> 09:16.655
to clean up the mess you made
at the Side Step.

09:16.793 --> 09:18.896
I, uh, I kind of have to
set up for the dance.

09:19.034 --> 09:21.068
I'm, like, chair
of homecoming committee,

09:21.206 --> 09:22.931
and I can't really
back down on my word.

09:25.344 --> 09:26.724
Well...

09:26.862 --> 09:29.103
tell your ride
to pick you up at the Side Step,

09:29.241 --> 09:32.241
because this mess
is both your responsibility.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.206
Okay. Quick lay of the land.
First off,

09:39.344 --> 09:41.275
the mayor is allergic
to shellfish.

09:41.413 --> 09:42.965
He's not.
He just doesn't like crabs.

09:43.103 --> 09:44.413
Thinks they're water spiders.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.896
Oh, my bad.

09:46.034 --> 09:47.482
This is Layla,
the mayor's head of security.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.517
She's great with all those
kind of insider details,

09:49.655 --> 09:52.344
but let's go ahead and treat it
like it's a real allergy, yeah?

09:52.482 --> 09:53.758
So, hit him with an EpiPen?

09:53.896 --> 09:55.586
Just don't slip him
any crab cakes.

09:55.724 --> 09:57.896
Noted.

09:58.034 --> 10:00.103
What about shrimp balls?

10:00.241 --> 10:02.379
Jokes aside, the mayor
does get regular death threats.

10:02.517 --> 10:04.758
Mostly just chicken scratch
from disgruntled citizens,

10:04.896 --> 10:06.586
but we do take every threat
very seriously.

10:06.724 --> 10:08.724
As you should.

10:08.862 --> 10:10.724
Service elevators
are already covered.

10:10.862 --> 10:12.413
Limited access
for cleared personnel,

10:12.551 --> 10:14.413
and one dedicated for the mayor.

10:14.551 --> 10:16.827
And, Layla, you said
that your security team's

10:16.965 --> 10:18.862
manning the perimeter?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.103
Yes. As support
for the mayor grows,

10:21.241 --> 10:24.413
so do his charity events,
hence the extra person power

10:24.551 --> 10:26.620
from you fine Rangers.
Should be a cakewalk

10:26.758 --> 10:28.655
compared to your typical days,
I'm sure.

10:28.793 --> 10:31.724
Mm, a crab cakewalk.
A cake crabwalk?

10:31.862 --> 10:33.103
Layla is top-notch.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.758
Only the best
for the mayor of Austin.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.206
Which is why I had Layla

10:37.344 --> 10:40.137
put Ranger Barnett
on mayor watch.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.724
Welcome aboard, Ranger Barnett.
Hope you can keep up.

10:43.862 --> 10:45.827
Thank you.
I'll try my best.

10:45.965 --> 10:47.896
Oh, I think he'll do just fine.

10:48.034 --> 10:50.448
This is the guy who saved
Captain James' life, after all.

10:50.586 --> 10:52.862
Well, where does that leave me--

10:53.000 --> 10:54.379
outside, with
the perimeter team?

10:54.517 --> 10:56.172
- Maybe manning the open bar?
- Oh, no, no.

10:56.310 --> 10:57.655
We would never
put someone with your skills

10:57.793 --> 10:59.655
on something so mundane.

11:00.551 --> 11:01.586
You're on my detail.

11:01.724 --> 11:04.310
Oh, I'm honored. Truly.

11:04.448 --> 11:07.689
But maybe someone
more, uh, familiar

11:07.827 --> 11:10.034
with your mannerisms
and routines and...

11:10.172 --> 11:12.344
allergies might
be better suited.

11:12.482 --> 11:14.413
Truth be told...

11:14.551 --> 11:17.413
- Bob is usually
my security detail.
- Hm.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.344
I'm actually kind of glad to
have a bit of a break from him.

11:19.482 --> 11:21.655
He's kind of a know-it-all,
really rubs me the wrong way.

11:21.793 --> 11:23.241
You know what I mean?

11:23.379 --> 11:24.862
Uh, uh-oh. No.
What's happening here?

11:25.000 --> 11:25.931
This is not
where the banner goes.

11:26.068 --> 11:28.068
Excuse me, banner people.

11:29.206 --> 11:31.068
A cakewalk, huh?

11:42.206 --> 11:43.482
Shout out to all y'all
who celebrated

11:43.620 --> 11:45.758
with me in epic glory.

11:47.068 --> 11:48.310
Damn, no wonder
the cops pulled up.

11:49.655 --> 11:50.758
Put it away.

11:50.896 --> 11:51.896
Yes, ma'am.

11:52.034 --> 11:53.103
<i>♪ All the seeds...♪</i>

11:53.241 --> 11:54.517
Do you really not care about

11:54.655 --> 11:56.206
what a disaster last night was?

11:56.344 --> 11:58.068
Ooh, someone's jealous that
their little brother managed

11:58.206 --> 12:00.620
to throw the best party
of the year without their help.

12:00.758 --> 12:02.793
Are you still drunk
or just stupid?

12:02.931 --> 12:06.103
We were detained. Dad left me
in jail and you said nothing.

12:06.241 --> 12:07.827
Don't blame me. You think
Dad ever let me get a chance

12:07.965 --> 12:10.172
to say anything at all? No.

12:10.310 --> 12:12.137
Look, he is the problem,
Stella, okay?

12:12.275 --> 12:15.310
He's the one who won't listen,
the one who left you in jail.

12:15.448 --> 12:17.482
If you're gonna point
your anger towards anybody,

12:17.620 --> 12:19.034
fire it towards Dad, not me.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.758
I am mad at Dad
for what he did,

12:21.896 --> 12:23.517
but you need
to own up to your part

12:23.655 --> 12:25.000
in all this and apologize too.

12:25.137 --> 12:27.172
Mm, apologize for...

12:29.103 --> 12:30.517
I don't know
who you're becoming,

12:30.655 --> 12:32.724
but it is not a good person
and I don't like it.

12:32.862 --> 12:34.586
Okay, maybe what you don't like
is that I'm becoming

12:34.724 --> 12:37.586
my own person
and you're losing a sidekick.

12:38.482 --> 12:41.137
You know, Stella, you were
supposed to leave for Sauber,

12:41.275 --> 12:43.310
and ever since you stayed,
it's like everybody

12:43.448 --> 12:45.931
is hyper-focused on you
and what you want to do.

12:46.068 --> 12:47.655
You're holding everybody hostage

12:47.793 --> 12:50.275
with your own
indecision, Stella.

12:51.620 --> 12:54.551
That's not true.
That's not what I'm doing.

12:54.689 --> 12:56.103
I don't mean to be.

12:56.241 --> 12:57.379
Okay, well,
since you want to stay

12:57.517 --> 12:59.517
hogging up the limelight,
I guess...

12:59.655 --> 13:01.896
I might as well just
do whatever I want.

13:02.034 --> 13:03.517
Who knows, Stella,

13:03.655 --> 13:04.896
I might even shine.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.655
I'm not keeping you
from shining.

13:07.793 --> 13:11.068
- Yeah, Scooter's here.
- Can you just wait a minute?

13:11.206 --> 13:13.724
Hey. Um, I got your text.
Where's he going?

13:13.862 --> 13:15.827
He's setting up for the dance.
You see,

13:15.965 --> 13:18.413
he gave his word
to the homecoming committee.

13:18.551 --> 13:20.448
Ah.

13:24.379 --> 13:26.551
Uh, you know,
it's still kind of early.

13:26.689 --> 13:27.896
Did you two eat yet?

13:28.034 --> 13:31.310
No. Uh, the kitchen
was a little...

13:31.448 --> 13:32.896
Hostile?

13:33.034 --> 13:35.827
Well, how about I make you two
a little happy curry?

13:35.965 --> 13:38.379
- Colton, you really
don't have to do that.
- No, I insist.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.413
I've been working on a little
special recipe, too, so...

13:41.551 --> 13:43.827
Ah. I'm intrigued.

13:43.965 --> 13:45.586
All right.

13:45.724 --> 13:47.172
Happy curry coming right up.

13:49.862 --> 13:52.379
- Well, that's nice.
- Mm-hmm.

13:52.517 --> 13:54.551
- Happy curry.
- Kind of like

13:54.689 --> 13:56.413
Aunt Geri making sad cookies.

13:56.551 --> 14:00.620
Yeah.

14:00.758 --> 14:02.482
It was good to see you.
Thank you so much for coming,

14:02.620 --> 14:04.517
all right?
See you next time. Bye.

14:04.655 --> 14:06.827
Oh, you know what?
It is supporters like you

14:06.965 --> 14:09.000
that help keep our Austin parks
lush and thriving.

14:09.137 --> 14:10.517
Thank you so much.

14:10.655 --> 14:12.517
- What you did on
the riverfront...
- Having fun?

14:12.655 --> 14:14.655
Well, if you consider
listening to your boy

14:14.793 --> 14:16.827
spew saccharine compliments
to a bunch of

14:16.965 --> 14:18.241
potential voters
like a human bee

14:18.379 --> 14:19.862
in a designer suit, then yeah.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.172
Fun.

14:22.310 --> 14:24.620
Listen, Kev's not so bad.

14:24.758 --> 14:26.724
He did a real solid for me.
Well, for...

14:26.862 --> 14:29.448
both of us, actually.

14:29.586 --> 14:32.310
And I get it--
he can come on a little strong,

14:32.448 --> 14:33.965
but he's nice.

14:34.103 --> 14:35.448
Thank you for what you
did with the mayor...

14:35.586 --> 14:37.482
You really can't see
that tailor-made charm

14:37.620 --> 14:40.448
for what it is? Kevin's
fake nice, politician nice.

14:40.586 --> 14:43.310
- Hi.
- Try not to judge a book
by its cover.

14:43.448 --> 14:46.137
How are things going
with the mayor, and with Layla?

14:49.206 --> 14:50.931
Good.
Things are going well.

14:51.068 --> 14:53.275
And I'm learning a lot.
Thank you.

14:53.413 --> 14:55.586
I mean, it may not be
chasing down a hot lead,

14:55.724 --> 14:59.413
but a crab cakewalk
ain't half bad, right?

15:02.034 --> 15:03.931
I'm gonna get back to it.

15:20.344 --> 15:22.448
Got to say,
kind of figured that, uh,

15:22.586 --> 15:25.413
"confronting our trauma"
would be a little more...

15:26.379 --> 15:29.000
...woo-woo meditation
and a little less

15:29.137 --> 15:30.896
stepping back here.

15:31.034 --> 15:33.413
No, it's about...

15:33.551 --> 15:35.172
physically coming back
to the space

15:35.310 --> 15:38.586
so that you can finally
free yourself from it.

15:38.724 --> 15:40.206
Okay.

15:50.310 --> 15:53.275
Hey.
We got this.

15:54.482 --> 15:56.034
Tell you what...

15:56.172 --> 15:58.172
why don't we do it together.

16:15.689 --> 16:17.137
- Uh...
- Yeah.

16:24.206 --> 16:26.413
See what you meant, now.

16:30.517 --> 16:33.793
JULIA [in distance]:
My name is Julia Johnson!

16:33.931 --> 16:35.689
Aah!

16:39.103 --> 16:40.655
Man, all this work
I did with Donna,

16:40.793 --> 16:42.310
and nothing really...

16:42.448 --> 16:44.793
prepares you for when
the memories come flooding back.

16:44.931 --> 16:46.344
Yeah.

16:49.482 --> 16:52.448
Feels kind of humbling,
you know?

16:54.344 --> 16:56.000
Being on the other side of it.

17:03.206 --> 17:04.965
I'm sorry.
Sorry, Cordi, I...

17:05.103 --> 17:06.448
No, hey, don't be.

17:06.586 --> 17:08.068
I-I thought that
I was ready, you know?

17:08.206 --> 17:10.172
I thought that
all this work with Donna

17:10.310 --> 17:12.793
to envision coming back
to this space,

17:12.931 --> 17:14.862
and-and it doesn't...

17:15.000 --> 17:16.034
doesn't matter.

17:16.172 --> 17:17.758
Hey, it matters.

17:17.896 --> 17:20.344
Stinker, it matters, all right?
And-and...

17:20.482 --> 17:22.551
and you're good.
All right? You stepped in.

17:22.689 --> 17:25.655
And-and we can leave
whenever you want.

17:25.793 --> 17:27.000
You know?

17:27.137 --> 17:29.068
Yeah, I-I know
it's hard remembering

17:29.206 --> 17:31.896
how painful it all was.
And-and

17:32.034 --> 17:34.034
the uncertainty. And I'm-I'm
so sorry you're still

17:34.172 --> 17:36.551
- dealing with that pain.
- No, no, you don't understand,

17:36.689 --> 17:39.551
Cordi, it wasn't the physical
torture that was the worst part.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.724
It was the mind games.

17:46.379 --> 17:47.724
Mind games.

17:54.931 --> 17:57.379
Mmm. Oh, this cucumber
mocktini ain't so bad

17:57.517 --> 17:58.655
for a drink with no buzz.

17:58.793 --> 18:01.413
- Mm. Is that one for Kev?
- Yeah.

18:01.551 --> 18:03.137
- Where is he, anyway?
- Mm.

18:03.275 --> 18:04.827
The, uh, mayor
had a question for him.

18:04.965 --> 18:06.413
Oh, I've had eyes on him.

18:06.551 --> 18:08.931
- He's just over...
- Over where?

18:09.068 --> 18:11.103
He was just there
a minute ago.

18:11.241 --> 18:13.275
Where...

18:25.827 --> 18:28.758
Okay, now, listen,
as the world tries to tell you

18:28.896 --> 18:32.586
who to be as you get your own
job and live your own lives,

18:32.724 --> 18:34.758
there's only one person
who can bring you back

18:34.896 --> 18:36.103
to who you really are.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.275
It's not your mom,
it's not your dad.

18:38.413 --> 18:39.655
It's your brother.

18:39.793 --> 18:42.206
Yes, that's right.
So you cherish them,

18:42.344 --> 18:44.275
even if they make mistakes
from time to time,

18:44.413 --> 18:46.827
yes? So maybe it's not
such a big deal

18:46.965 --> 18:48.620
that your brother
spilled juice on your shoe

18:48.758 --> 18:50.482
and maybe you can
kind of forgive him a little?

18:50.620 --> 18:53.724
Come on.
Give him a hug.

18:53.862 --> 18:55.448
There you go.

18:55.586 --> 18:57.068
All right, get back out there.

18:57.206 --> 18:58.655
Eat a bunch of chocolate.
There's a whole chocolate bar.

18:58.793 --> 19:00.310
Go nuts.
Your parents will love it.

19:00.448 --> 19:02.241
Go, go, go.
Bye, guys.

19:02.379 --> 19:04.275
Oh. Hello.

19:04.413 --> 19:05.827
Well, that was wholesome.

19:05.965 --> 19:07.862
Yeah.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.448
So, what-- are their parents
big donors or...

19:10.586 --> 19:12.379
Oh, no, no.
I don't-I don't think so.

19:12.517 --> 19:13.689
I was just trying to help.

19:13.827 --> 19:15.793
- Hopefully something stuck.
- Yeah.

19:18.482 --> 19:19.724
Hopefully.

19:23.724 --> 19:26.034
The mayor's looking for you.

19:26.172 --> 19:27.068
- Great.
- Yep.

19:27.206 --> 19:29.172
- Lead the way.
- I will.

19:30.482 --> 19:32.206
Is that parsley in the sauce?

19:32.344 --> 19:34.275
Carrot tops, actually.

19:34.413 --> 19:36.551
Oh.
Well, I got to try that.

19:36.689 --> 19:39.448
You know, you've got
a real knack for flavor.

19:39.586 --> 19:41.586
Have you ever thought about
going to culinary school?

19:41.724 --> 19:43.310
I just think
it's a hobby for now.

19:43.448 --> 19:44.551
Well, at least Stella and I
get to reap

19:44.689 --> 19:46.931
the rewards of your hobby.

19:48.655 --> 19:49.620
I'm glad you guys liked it.

19:49.758 --> 19:51.310
- You guys done?
- Yes.

Uh...

20:02.275 --> 20:05.241
it looks like happy curry
didn't alter your mood.

20:06.793 --> 20:08.379
I just...

20:08.517 --> 20:10.758
I feel like I made
this last-minute decision

20:10.896 --> 20:14.068
to stay in Austin
and now that I have,

20:14.206 --> 20:15.689
the ranch doesn't
feel like home.

20:15.827 --> 20:17.827
Dad doesn't know
what to do with me,

20:17.965 --> 20:21.137
and August doesn't want
anything to do with me.

20:21.275 --> 20:23.517
I didn't even know
he felt that way.

20:24.586 --> 20:26.931
The only support
that I have is Colton.

20:27.068 --> 20:29.103
Oh.

20:29.241 --> 20:32.241
And you and Gramps,
of course.

My brother and I--

20:38.931 --> 20:40.655
- your-your Granduncle Will--
- Mm-hmm.

20:40.793 --> 20:42.379
uh, we used to fight so much

20:42.517 --> 20:44.655
that my dad started

20:44.793 --> 20:46.655
blaming us for thunderstorms.

20:46.793 --> 20:49.586
What were you fighting about?

20:50.620 --> 20:51.655
Nonsense.

20:51.793 --> 20:52.931
I mean, I don't even remember

20:53.068 --> 20:54.206
what the fights were about.

20:54.344 --> 20:55.655
I just remember feeling...

20:55.793 --> 20:57.482
misunderstood.

20:57.620 --> 21:00.413
It got so bad that I...
I moved in with a friend.

21:01.482 --> 21:03.000
Then after a few months, I...

21:03.137 --> 21:05.620
I-I kind of missed Will.

21:08.551 --> 21:10.482
So, time apart helped?

21:11.310 --> 21:13.482
Well, maybe...

21:13.620 --> 21:15.137
growing up a little

21:15.275 --> 21:17.931
allowed us to appreciate
each other.

21:19.068 --> 21:20.448
But don't let it get so bad

21:20.586 --> 21:22.275
that you can't
come back from it.

21:22.413 --> 21:24.793
It'll get better
between you and Augie.

21:26.172 --> 21:28.620
And you may even
miss each other.

21:28.758 --> 21:30.310
In time.

21:35.068 --> 21:37.379
What do you mean, mind games?

21:40.586 --> 21:42.482
I thought you were dead.

21:42.620 --> 21:44.068
They told me...

21:44.206 --> 21:47.965
They forced me to bury you.

21:50.344 --> 21:52.137
Hey.

21:52.275 --> 21:53.551
What-what do you mean...

21:55.137 --> 21:57.586
you... buried me?

21:58.310 --> 22:01.379
Three guys dragged me outside.

22:03.931 --> 22:06.758
After you got pulled in
with Sean...

22:07.689 --> 22:09.620
They had masks on, so

22:09.758 --> 22:12.206
I couldn't
see their faces, but...

22:12.344 --> 22:15.206
they reeked like sulfur.

22:15.344 --> 22:16.655
<i>And they told me you were dead.</i>

22:16.793 --> 22:19.931
<i>Sean had killed you.</i>

22:23.241 --> 22:25.000
Bury your brother.

22:27.413 --> 22:28.517
<i>And then they forced me</i>

22:28.655 --> 22:30.689
to bury your body.

22:36.379 --> 22:38.586
Let me see him one last time.

22:45.655 --> 22:46.931
But it wasn't you.

22:49.206 --> 22:50.551
Aah!

22:51.689 --> 22:53.482
<i>It was Neo.</i>

22:56.275 --> 22:58.896
I know that it's irrational,

22:59.034 --> 23:00.517
okay?

23:00.655 --> 23:02.034
Even after months,

23:02.172 --> 23:03.586
the pain that I felt

23:03.724 --> 23:05.689
when I thought that...

23:05.827 --> 23:08.931
you were dead was so real.

23:09.793 --> 23:11.689
And it's still real.

23:11.827 --> 23:15.172
Even if your death wasn't.
I haven't been able to tell you,

23:15.310 --> 23:17.827
- and...
- I know, I know. Hey, hey,
I hear you, I hear you, okay?

23:17.965 --> 23:20.034
I'm here. I'm here.
And I ain't going anywhere.

23:20.172 --> 23:21.655
You hear me?

23:22.827 --> 23:24.655
I'm not going anywhere.

23:35.896 --> 23:37.068
- Cassandra.
- Hmm?

23:37.206 --> 23:38.862
Could you, um,
get me a ginger ale?

23:39.896 --> 23:42.413
Just feeling a bit nauseous
all of a sudden.

23:43.586 --> 23:45.241
Stay with the mayor.

23:45.379 --> 23:47.068
Cass, call 911.

23:47.206 --> 23:48.379
Yeah.

23:48.517 --> 23:50.655
Hold on, Kevin.

24:01.034 --> 24:03.137
Okay. Uh, well,
that sounds bad.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.379
What's the damage?

24:04.517 --> 24:05.793
<i>It's not damaged.</i>

24:05.931 --> 24:09.137
It's just...
August's friends are sloppy.

24:09.275 --> 24:10.689
<i>It'll be all good by happy hour.</i>

24:10.827 --> 24:13.241
I was just letting you know
so you weren't surprised

24:13.379 --> 24:14.655
<i>when you got in.</i>

24:14.793 --> 24:18.103
Okay.
All right, well, thank you.

24:18.241 --> 24:19.586
Um, just real quick--

24:19.724 --> 24:22.068
<i>I have to be gone
for a little bit,</i>

24:22.206 --> 24:24.448
but I was hoping that
you would be my voice

24:24.586 --> 24:26.103
around the Side Step
while I'm gone.

24:26.241 --> 24:28.000
I didn't know you were
going anywhere or...

24:28.137 --> 24:29.413
<i>Yeah, I just...</i>

24:29.551 --> 24:32.689
I have to deal with some
Broussard family stuff.

24:32.827 --> 24:34.827
<i>But I will need someone to</i>

24:34.965 --> 24:36.862
come by my house, water plants,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.586
run the faucets, stuff
like that. Would you mind?

24:39.724 --> 24:42.103
- No, not at all.
<i>- Great.</i>

24:42.241 --> 24:44.517
Thank you. And please,
feel free to crash.

24:44.655 --> 24:47.206
<i>Honestly, it would be a relief
knowing that you weren't</i>

24:47.344 --> 24:49.172
driving all the way back
to the Davidson Ranch

24:49.310 --> 24:50.724
after closing the bar.

24:50.862 --> 24:54.068
Yeah. Uh, thank you, Aunt Geri.
Appreciate it.

24:54.206 --> 24:57.103
No, thank you, Colton.
I'll talk to you soon.

25:06.310 --> 25:08.379
I just want you to know
I would have gotten you

25:08.517 --> 25:09.793
that ginger ale
if I'd have known

25:09.931 --> 25:11.172
you'd throw
such a temper tantrum.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.931
And I'd laugh
if it didn't feel like

25:13.068 --> 25:15.137
an elephant was on my chest.

25:20.655 --> 25:24.275
Uh, hey, great. Listen,
he's coughing up pink fluid,

25:24.413 --> 25:26.000
possibly pulmonary edema.

25:26.137 --> 25:29.206
Get him some oxygen ASAP,
all right?

25:32.241 --> 25:33.724
Breathe.

25:35.896 --> 25:37.344
I don't know, Cass, I'm...

25:37.482 --> 25:40.137
I'm struggling with
the diagnosis here. I mean,

25:40.275 --> 25:43.827
last time I saw symptoms
like this was Afghanistan.

25:43.965 --> 25:45.965
Guys were exposed to nerve gas.

25:46.103 --> 25:48.068
Not that I think that this could
be anything like that, but...

25:48.206 --> 25:49.689
Wait, but could it?

25:50.896 --> 25:52.206
Before you dismiss
the possibility,

25:52.344 --> 25:55.241
we did find nerve gas
where Walker was abducted.

25:55.379 --> 25:56.965
Yeah, but Walker contained it.

25:57.103 --> 25:58.793
Besides, nerve agents
sometimes have

25:58.931 --> 26:00.482
a delayed onset in symptoms.

26:00.620 --> 26:03.137
Well, couldn't that explain
why no one else is affected?

26:03.275 --> 26:07.068
Yeah, that's one explanation
but... when diagnosing,

26:07.206 --> 26:10.413
you learn to look for
the horses, not the zebras,

26:10.551 --> 26:12.655
- when you hear hoofbeats.
- When you hear what, now?

26:12.793 --> 26:14.000
It's a metaphor
for when you're looking

26:14.137 --> 26:15.482
for the most common diagnosis

26:15.620 --> 26:17.172
- rather than the exotic one.
- Walker.

26:17.310 --> 26:20.172
Cass, hey.
I just saw your text.

26:20.310 --> 26:23.103
<i>- The mayor was attacked?</i>
- Yeah. Possibly
by a nerve agent.

26:23.241 --> 26:25.965
His chief of staff was the only
person affected so far.

26:26.103 --> 26:27.448
<i>He may have unknowingly</i>

26:27.586 --> 26:29.620
intercepted an attack.
We just don't know where.

26:29.758 --> 26:31.551
I'm putting you on speaker.

26:32.344 --> 26:35.206
Hey. Any chance
the victim came into contact

26:35.344 --> 26:37.655
with anything that could have
contained gas or may have

26:37.793 --> 26:39.448
been tainted with
a toxic liquid solution?

26:39.586 --> 26:42.413
<i>Kevin said he does pretty much
everything for the mayor.</i>

26:42.551 --> 26:44.586
Drafting budgets, opening mail.

26:45.448 --> 26:47.517
You said that there's been
an uptick in threats.

26:47.655 --> 26:49.068
What about letters?

26:49.206 --> 26:51.620
There was a th-threat letter
this morning.

26:51.758 --> 26:53.275
All it said was,

26:53.413 --> 26:56.172
"Your time is up
and you don't even know it."

26:56.310 --> 26:57.793
<i>"Your time is up and you</i>

26:57.931 --> 26:58.689
<i>don't even know it."
That sounds like</i>

26:58.827 --> 26:59.793
a taunt referring to

26:59.931 --> 27:01.689
a nerve agent's delayed onset.

27:01.827 --> 27:03.275
Hey, guys, scrub and disinfect

27:03.413 --> 27:05.896
his hands wherever
he had contact, all right?

27:06.034 --> 27:08.862
- Uh, where's the letter now?
- APD has it.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.586
They track all threats.

27:10.724 --> 27:12.068
Without a return address
they can track

27:12.206 --> 27:14.413
with Intelligent Mail barcode.
I'm on with...

27:15.482 --> 27:16.758
Thank you, Deputy.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.724
The letter was sent
from Eastvale.

27:18.862 --> 27:20.931
<i>Eastvale-- that's right near
Westvale Psychiatric,</i>

27:21.068 --> 27:22.586
the-the hospital where I was
taken when I was abducted.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.413
I'm-I'm actually

27:24.551 --> 27:27.034
there right now, with Liam.
Uh, long story.

27:27.172 --> 27:29.344
When I was researching
Westvale Psychiatric,

27:29.482 --> 27:31.724
I remember
reading about Eastvale.

27:31.862 --> 27:35.137
It turned into a ghost town
after the coal mine shut down.

27:36.586 --> 27:38.448
- Liam.
- Yeah?

27:38.586 --> 27:41.517
Hey. You said your tormenters
stunk like sulfur?

27:41.655 --> 27:43.931
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:44.068 --> 27:46.724
Sulfur.
Uh, that can be the odor of

27:46.862 --> 27:48.344
<i>coal processing.
What are the odds</i>

27:48.482 --> 27:50.344
that these are
the same people who abducted us?

27:50.482 --> 27:52.758
But we wiped those anarchists
off the map.

27:53.586 --> 27:54.655
That letter--

27:54.793 --> 27:57.241
it smelled like rotten eggs.

27:57.379 --> 27:59.482
Sulfur.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.413
Maybe we didn't totally

28:01.551 --> 28:03.275
wipe them off the map.
Maybe they're

28:03.413 --> 28:05.689
storing more of the nerve agent
off-site at Eastvale.

28:05.827 --> 28:08.103
<i>Well, what better place
to store a nerve agent</i>

28:08.241 --> 28:09.241
than an abandoned refinery?

28:09.379 --> 28:11.448
Walker, you said you're nearby?

28:11.586 --> 28:12.724
I can be there in five.

28:12.862 --> 28:14.655
I'll get backup to meet you

28:14.793 --> 28:16.413
<i>- at the plant.</i>
- Thanks, guys.

28:19.310 --> 28:21.137
- Think we should
go ahead and head out.
- The guy that

28:21.275 --> 28:24.310
did this to me--
is he still out there?

28:25.965 --> 28:28.448
I don't know.

28:41.862 --> 28:44.034
There's no cars,
no signs of life.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.896
Yeah. Well...

28:48.034 --> 28:50.172
I'm not taking any chances.

28:50.310 --> 28:52.344
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
Cassie said

28:52.482 --> 28:55.448
- that she's calling for backup,
so just-just wait.
- Liam, listen.

28:55.586 --> 28:57.344
if someone is making
nerve agent in there,

28:57.482 --> 28:59.413
I-I can't risk
waiting even one minute.

28:59.551 --> 29:01.793
They unleash that stuff,
chemicals like that--

29:01.931 --> 29:03.379
it's a biohazard.

29:03.517 --> 29:04.517
Every second counts.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.586
Thank you for, you know,

33:49.724 --> 33:51.448
wh-what you did in there.

33:52.310 --> 33:53.586
It was nothing.

33:53.724 --> 33:56.241
Well, it's definitely
not nothing.

33:56.379 --> 33:58.620
It's the reason I'm alive.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.862
Liam...

34:02.000 --> 34:04.793
I'm so sorry for all that
you've been through.

34:06.724 --> 34:10.000
And I'm sorry I didn't...

34:11.310 --> 34:13.241
...meet you earlier
where you were.

34:13.379 --> 34:16.724
This might sound
a little foolish, but, um...

34:18.172 --> 34:19.793
I guess I'm ashamed of myself.

34:20.862 --> 34:22.758
When Em told me she was
pregnant with Stella,

34:22.896 --> 34:26.206
in that moment,
I decided to not reenlist

34:26.344 --> 34:28.655
so that I wouldn't miss
any milestones, you know?

34:28.793 --> 34:31.172
And then Em...

34:31.310 --> 34:32.655
Em was killed,

34:32.793 --> 34:34.793
and, uh...

34:34.931 --> 34:36.551
and I fled.
I left.

34:36.689 --> 34:39.241
You didn't.
You stayed.

34:39.379 --> 34:42.448
And you were the rock
for everybody.

34:43.862 --> 34:46.241
And since I've been back
from being under, I...

34:46.379 --> 34:47.586
I know I've missed
more milestones.

34:47.724 --> 34:49.965
No, no, no.
That's not true, Cordi.

34:50.103 --> 34:51.931
You've been here.
You-you... you are here.

34:52.068 --> 34:53.793
- You...
- Yeah, well...

34:53.931 --> 34:55.206
when I got grabbed,

34:55.344 --> 34:58.034
I missed Stella's graduation.

34:58.172 --> 35:00.310
And, uh, apparently,

35:00.448 --> 35:02.413
threw her whole life off course.

35:02.551 --> 35:04.310
It's always my family

35:04.448 --> 35:07.620
who suffers because of me.

35:07.758 --> 35:09.172
No. You are not...

35:09.310 --> 35:11.862
Hey, you're not responsible
for Stella's choices.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.758
You're not even responsible
for my abduction, okay?

35:14.896 --> 35:16.379
We're both victims of that.

35:16.517 --> 35:18.275
You know what
you are responsible for?

35:18.413 --> 35:21.620
How you handle a situation
or how you avoid it.

35:22.896 --> 35:25.310
Yeah. Yeah.

35:25.448 --> 35:28.172
- You're right.
- Hey.

35:28.310 --> 35:30.241
Thank you

35:30.379 --> 35:32.344
for coming with me today.

35:32.482 --> 35:35.310
It meant a lot.
I, uh...

35:35.448 --> 35:37.310
I know that
there's a lot to process

35:37.448 --> 35:38.896
after everything we've
been through, you know,

35:39.034 --> 35:40.689
but it does make me feel better

35:40.827 --> 35:41.793
to know that

35:41.931 --> 35:43.689
we can face it together,

35:43.827 --> 35:46.068
that you'll listen.

35:46.931 --> 35:48.206
Yeah.

35:49.068 --> 35:50.689
Hey.

35:51.827 --> 35:54.310
I will listen, all right?

35:54.448 --> 35:55.827
I promise you,
from here on out,

35:55.965 --> 35:57.586
I'll be better about that.

35:57.724 --> 36:00.827
Hey, sometimes people
just want to be heard.

36:00.965 --> 36:02.241
Yeah.

36:02.379 --> 36:03.551
The sooner the better,

36:03.689 --> 36:06.931
but better late than never.

36:15.379 --> 36:17.620
Looks like our Walker boys
just took down

36:17.758 --> 36:21.068
a chemical manufacturer
for that anarchist group.

36:21.206 --> 36:22.965
It was just one guy?

36:23.103 --> 36:24.482
Are we sure there's no one else?

36:24.620 --> 36:26.724
As far as we can tell.

36:26.862 --> 36:28.241
Huh.

36:30.344 --> 36:33.068
- Is he beckoning me?
- Yeah.

36:33.206 --> 36:34.793
- Go on.
- I don't know.

36:37.689 --> 36:38.827
How you feeling?

36:38.965 --> 36:41.206
Little less like dying?

36:41.344 --> 36:43.413
My soul is returning to my body.

36:43.551 --> 36:45.517
Oh, well, if only
politicians had souls.

36:47.931 --> 36:50.965
Look, I'm sure today probably
wasn't your cup of tea.

36:51.103 --> 36:53.034
I mean, I bet
you're used to tracking down

36:53.172 --> 36:56.000
serial killers and dismantling
shadow organizations

36:56.137 --> 36:57.482
and cool stuff like that.

36:57.620 --> 36:59.965
It's mostly just paperwork.

37:00.103 --> 37:03.103
At any rate... thank you.

37:04.241 --> 37:06.965
And with any luck, this won't be
the last time you save my life.

37:07.103 --> 37:09.965
However, I will be getting
my own ginger ale from now on.

37:10.103 --> 37:12.793
Oh, good.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.689
Cassie, wait.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.241
You're still
part of my security detail.

37:22.586 --> 37:23.931
You're serious.

37:24.068 --> 37:26.689
As a nerve agent attack.

37:26.827 --> 37:29.827
Too soon, man, too soon.

37:29.965 --> 37:31.827
All right,

that I'm not gonna
be around as much

I have this museum
field trip urge

37:52.448 --> 37:54.275
to, like, not touch anything.

37:55.551 --> 37:57.896
Colton, you're allowed

38:37.137 --> 38:39.689
I'm sorry for everything.
