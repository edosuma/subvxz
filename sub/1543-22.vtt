00:02.669 --> 00:05.548
A wise man once told me,
"Family don't end in blood."

00:05.739 --> 00:09.551
One of Europe's oldest families.
The House of Frankenstein.

00:09.743 --> 00:14.249
- But it don't start there either.
- The key to our success is secrecy.

00:14.481 --> 00:18.258
- Family cares about you...
- Dean thinks the Mark of Cain is his fate.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.864
- ...not what you can do for them.
- You're not king, not anymore.

00:22.055 --> 00:26.367
- You're their bitch.
- Family's there. Through the good, bad.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.005
- So you had the book.
- Dean...

00:28.195 --> 00:31.540
Lied right to my face. And then you
pulled Cass into it. And Charlie.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.712
- All of it.
- The agreement stands.

00:33.901 --> 00:37.940
Find me a cure for my brother,
and I'll kill Crowley. But until then...

00:38.171 --> 00:40.412
- They got your back...
- Oh, wow.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.616
- ...even when it hurts.
- Someone is here.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.518
- Give whoever that is whatever they want.
- I can't do that.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.890
- Nigh.
- That's family.

00:50.083 --> 00:52.029
Charlie?

01:02.296 --> 01:04.242
- I got it.
- Yeah.

01:12.472 --> 01:13.951
Styne.

01:14.141 --> 01:15.381
Yo.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.988
Hey, man. Hold up.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.618
- What?
- Me and my boys, we got a bet.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.558
How much of a virgin are you?

01:26.320 --> 01:28.061
- What?
- Heh.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.896
I mean, you ain't never got laid before,
obviously.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.503
But you've seen a boob, right?

01:36.263 --> 01:39.437
I don't mean on Game of Thrones.
I'm talking about in the wild.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.672
Is this a joke?

01:45.472 --> 01:47.076
I look like a comedian to you?

01:49.509 --> 01:51.284
Answer the question.

01:55.148 --> 01:58.686
You look like the kind of dude
who wants people to think he's hood.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.123
But no.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.699
See the hundred-dollar haircut,
the hybrid keys?

02:03.924 --> 02:06.131
I'd say you grew up
in a white-bread wonderland.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.806
Your dad's probably a dentist,
your mom's mostly Botox.

02:08.996 --> 02:10.497
And they both bang the pool boy.

02:10.697 --> 02:13.678
Oh, and you like rap,
but you're scared of black people.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.114
Even Will Smith.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.109
Damn.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.215
- You got a mouth on you, little bitch.
- Ungh!

02:26.980 --> 02:28.288
I'm gonna kick your ass.

02:29.549 --> 02:30.721
There a problem here?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.365
No, man. All good.

02:39.559 --> 02:42.563
Well, I wasn't asking you, dickbag.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.372
Cy, we got a problem?

02:48.969 --> 02:52.416
No, it's fine. Let's go.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.113
Cherri Berri.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.083
My favorite.

03:30.277 --> 03:31.620
Yo, man...

03:32.079 --> 03:33.387
...I got no beef with you.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.861
You put hands on my cousin.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.546
What about you? You gonna let it go?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.885
- Never.
- That's my boys.

04:10.817 --> 04:13.263
Charlie. Hey, I got you.

04:13.453 --> 04:15.091
It's okay.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.150
I forgive you, Dean.

04:34.975 --> 04:37.182
I'm so sorry, kiddo.

04:51.792 --> 04:52.930
I love you.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.030
I know.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.677
Charlie...

05:04.471 --> 05:05.609
...we're gonna miss you.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.042
You were the best.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.956
- And I'm so sorry...
- Shut up.

05:13.346 --> 05:16.384
You got her killed.
You don't get to apologize.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.691
- We were trying to help you.
- I didn't need help.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.334
I told you to leave it alone.

05:25.692 --> 05:27.672
What was I supposed to do...

05:27.861 --> 05:29.033
...just watch you die?

05:30.730 --> 05:32.539
The Mark isn't gonna kill me.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.745
Maybe not...

05:37.737 --> 05:40.877
...but when it's done with you,
you won't be you anymore.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.246
Dean, you're all I've got.

05:47.013 --> 05:51.894
So of course I was gonna fight for you
because that's what we do.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.759
- Listen, I had a shot...
- Yeah, you had a shot.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.433
Charlie's dead.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.230
Nice shot.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.941
You think I'm...?

06:12.038 --> 06:13.949
You think I'm ever...

06:14.608 --> 06:16.281
...gonna forgive myself for that?

06:17.277 --> 06:18.756
You wanna know what I think?

06:18.945 --> 06:20.947
I think it should be you up there, not her.

06:22.782 --> 06:28.061
This thing, with Cass and the book,
ends now.

06:28.255 --> 06:31.361
Shut it down before somebody else
gets hurt. You understand me?

06:35.896 --> 06:37.375
What about you?

06:38.198 --> 06:40.644
Oh, I'm gonna find whoever did this.

06:41.134 --> 06:44.206
And I'm gonna rip apart everything
and everyone that they ever loved...

06:44.404 --> 06:46.816
...and then I'm gonna tear out their heart.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.422
Is that you talking or the Mark?

06:55.982 --> 06:57.154
Does it matter?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.140
There you go. Nice.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.111
Dude, you still coming to L.A.?

07:18.905 --> 07:23.354
Hope so. It's just my family. if they
found out I was moving, they'd kill me.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.623
No. Literally.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.817
My folks are, like, weird.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.324
Scary weird.

07:34.921 --> 07:36.764
Your father wants to see you.

07:40.026 --> 07:43.473
Ahem. So as I understand...

07:43.663 --> 07:45.506
...you didn't get the book...

07:45.699 --> 07:47.701
...and you lost an arm.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.778
Not what I call a win, son.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.975
And you know what we do to losers.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.214
Yes, sir.

07:56.609 --> 07:58.213
That's why I brought you a present.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.855
I found a stash of magic
like you wouldn't believe.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.062
Try me.

08:07.620 --> 08:12.399
The Winchesters dragged me
to their clubhouse...

08:12.625 --> 08:19.008
...and it's filled with folklore, artifacts,
maybe even the Book of the Damned.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.536
Now, you give me a few guys...

08:22.736 --> 08:26.650
...and I'll make the biggest score
this family's ever seen.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.987
You're gonna need a new arm.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.350
My boy.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.217
- It's a special day.
- It is?

08:42.489 --> 08:45.698
Eli told me about your little
scuffle, and I thought to myself:

08:45.892 --> 08:49.362
"Now, this, this is a teachable moment."

08:49.562 --> 08:51.735
You see, men like him...

08:51.931 --> 08:54.377
Well, trash like him.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.047
...Now, they're only good for one thing.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.410
Spare parts.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.177
You're gonna carve him up.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.281
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

09:06.513 --> 09:07.617
It's easy.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.293
No. That's not...

09:12.018 --> 09:13.895
- I don't want to.
- What...

09:15.522 --> 09:16.592
...be like us?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.931
- That's not what I meant.
- Good.

09:20.126 --> 09:22.231
Because that...

09:22.729 --> 09:24.231
...it's your legacy.

09:24.431 --> 09:27.708
You will not turn your back on this family.

09:28.468 --> 09:33.884
Now, you always been soft, Cyrus.
You're the baby, it's natural.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.580
But that ends now.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.826
See, either you're gonna do this...

09:47.053 --> 09:48.896
...or I'm gonna butcher that boy...

09:49.089 --> 09:53.162
...and then I'm gonna put you
up on the table and go to work.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.331
You understand?

10:02.836 --> 10:04.338
Okay.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.181
There you go.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.658
This is who you are, son.

10:37.837 --> 10:41.182
Rudy. Hey, I just sent you
some security-cam footage of a black sedan.

10:41.374 --> 10:45.151
- I need you to run the plates.
- Can do. Just give me a sec here.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.059
Weird. Uh...

10:50.283 --> 10:53.492
The vehicle's registered to Eldon Styne,
out of Shreveport, Louisiana.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.393
But there's no street address.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.795
- This guy got something to hide?
- Yeah, bigtime.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.493
I'll fill you in later. Thanks.

10:59.692 --> 11:03.731
Yeah, sure, but, uh, isn't
that what Sam's for?

11:05.298 --> 11:07.005
He's busy.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.416
Stop looking at me.

11:15.642 --> 11:19.249
I'm sorry, you're just fascinating.

11:19.812 --> 11:22.156
An angel that rejected heaven.

11:22.348 --> 11:27.889
That's like a fish that wants to fly
or a dog that thinks he's people.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.001
Well, I'm a lot like people.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.364
Keep telling yourself that, dear.

11:36.563 --> 11:39.066
About bloody time.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.107
Where's Charlie?

11:51.411 --> 11:53.391
Oh, no. God.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.856
I should have gone after her.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.460
I...

11:58.384 --> 11:59.590
What happened?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.764
Me.

12:04.791 --> 12:08.933
The Stynes, uh,
they caught up with her, and...

12:10.930 --> 12:12.432
Dean's gone after them.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.076
So he knows?

12:16.703 --> 12:18.148
Yeah.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.744
Well, what now?

12:21.374 --> 12:23.615
- I'm shutting this down. I
promised Dean... ROWENA: Eh.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.757
Hello? Anyone want to tell me
what's going on?

12:26.946 --> 12:28.152
No.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.992
- What about her?
- Guess.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.457
I'd be happy to kill her.
She just called me a fish.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.664
What about Dean?

12:45.498 --> 12:47.138
We, uh... We should be able to track him.

12:47.333 --> 12:50.610
I LoJacked the Impala a few weeks back,
just in case. Here.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.935
Is this what I think it is?

13:21.100 --> 13:25.947
Oh. That little minx.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.015
She's cracked the code.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.484
Can you read the Book of the Damned
with this?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.956
Every last word.

13:37.684 --> 13:40.631
We can cure the Mark of Cain.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.668
Cass, go find Dean. Make sure he doesn't go
too far off the reservation, okay?

13:50.863 --> 13:53.207
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving my brother.

13:53.399 --> 13:55.879
- You told Dean...
- I know what I told Dean.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.980
Cass, look.

13:58.171 --> 14:02.517
I've been the one out there
messed up and scared and alone.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.387
- And Dean...
- He did whatever he could to save you.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.491
Yes. I mean, it's become his thing.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.319
I owe him this.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.927
I owe him everything.

14:12.151 --> 14:16.156
I know he pretends that he can ride
the Mark out, but you and I know the truth.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.701
We know what happens if we don't cure him.
We know where that road ends.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.065
- Black eyes and blood.
- Yes.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.735
Go, find him, Cass.

14:25.531 --> 14:26.601
Keep him safe.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.608
Okay.

14:29.435 --> 14:33.110
Oh. I do love a bit of intrigue.

14:34.173 --> 14:37.450
Right, less talk, more translating. Go.

14:37.677 --> 14:42.786
About that, I said I can read the book,
never said I would.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.532
- We had a deal.
- Oh, we did. We do.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.794
And it's time you held up your end.

14:53.092 --> 14:57.404
I want my son dead.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.099
- After...
- Now.

14:59.599 --> 15:05.242
Once I cast the spell,
and you need me to cast that spell...

15:05.438 --> 15:06.781
...who knows what'll happen?

15:08.307 --> 15:09.581
I don't have time for this!

15:09.776 --> 15:11.722
Right, you don't.

15:11.911 --> 15:15.950
Your brother's a walking freaking time
bomb, and the clock, she's a-ticking.

15:16.149 --> 15:22.259
So you will kill my son,
and you will do it my way now!

15:40.339 --> 15:41.682
Well done.

15:42.842 --> 15:48.190
You know, in the old country,
they make you eat your first heart.

15:49.015 --> 15:54.260
But I like to think
we're a little more civilized.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.865
How's it fit?

15:59.358 --> 16:00.701
Like a glove.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.132
Can I go?

16:04.764 --> 16:05.799
No.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.508
You're coming with me.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.841
- What's the problem, officer?
- License and reg.

16:45.037 --> 16:46.710
Yeah.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.721
Hm. Ashley J. Williams, huh?

16:51.177 --> 16:52.588
Uh, you can call me Ash.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.189
Out of the car, Ashley.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.559
Well, I wasn't speeding, I'm sober...
Mostly sober. So, what's this about'?

17:05.090 --> 17:06.365
Blinker's out.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.536
- Hey.
- That's a violation.

17:09.729 --> 17:10.763
Don't.

17:12.164 --> 17:13.604
- Two blinkers out.
- Son of a bitch.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.541
And attempted assault of a police officer.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.738
We're taking you down to the station, boy.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.748
- Oh, I ain't your boy, Cletus.
- Right now you are.

17:21.941 --> 17:26.356
So you best settle or you're gonna get
an ass-whooping instead of a phone call.

17:35.354 --> 17:36.389
Everything all right?

17:38.624 --> 17:40.467
Fantastic.

17:40.693 --> 17:44.436
That is the best cup of
coffee I've ever had.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.405
Thanks. Roast the beans myself.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.908
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

17:49.101 --> 17:52.571
- Learned how when I was living in Ecuador.
- You've been to Ecuador?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.150
I've been all over.

17:55.374 --> 17:58.583
If you can fry up a decent burger,
you can get work anywhere.

17:59.478 --> 18:02.084
Man, I'm dying to head to Asia.

18:02.281 --> 18:03.885
Yeah, it's just a dream, you know?

18:04.951 --> 18:06.430
Funny...

18:06.619 --> 18:08.963
...I'm in the business
of making dreams come true.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.136
- Hello?
- Hey, I need your harp.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.399
What?

18:19.565 --> 18:21.169
Dean?

18:33.646 --> 18:35.125
"Ozzy Osbourne...

18:35.748 --> 18:40.094
...Lemmy Kilmister, Freddy Mercury."

18:40.286 --> 18:41.424
Damn.

18:41.621 --> 18:45.694
I mean, they said you
were a pro, but, uh...

18:46.025 --> 18:47.129
Who said that?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.303
I'll ask the questions here.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.038
Mm.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.804
Like, for example, you got 17 fake IDs...

18:58.004 --> 19:02.680
...and a trunk full of guns, knives,
freaking ninja stars.

19:02.875 --> 19:06.448
I mean, who are you, man?

19:07.013 --> 19:10.984
I'm the guy that's gonna get out of here
in about 30 seconds.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.129
Heh. Yeah, right.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.200
Real mature.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.913
Keys.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.847
Keys now.

19:50.756 --> 19:54.533
He was driving a '67 Impala,
just like you said.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.003
Sure, can do.

19:57.496 --> 19:59.669
Who you talking to'?

20:00.533 --> 20:01.944
I...

20:03.369 --> 20:04.439
Nobody.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.779
Nobody.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.552
- Ungh!
- That's for lying to me.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.088
And that is for my baby.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.588
Now...

20:17.616 --> 20:18.959
...who were you talking to?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.460
Monroe Styne.

20:23.622 --> 20:28.071
He said if I saw you,
I was supposed to bring you in...

20:28.260 --> 20:29.898
...mm, and then call him.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.872
Monroe. Any relation to Eldon?

20:33.399 --> 20:34.537
His daddy.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.106
Where can I find them?

20:37.636 --> 20:39.616
Oh, you can't take on the Stynes.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.246
They own this town.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.785
They're practically gods around here.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.615
Yeah?

20:46.946 --> 20:49.153
Well, I kill gods.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.627
Dean?

20:58.324 --> 21:00.770
Dean?

21:09.568 --> 21:11.104
Devil's trap bullet.

21:11.303 --> 21:12.611
Moose.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.615
Agh. Shooting me from behind.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.982
Oh. Poor form, even for you.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.850
- Where's Dean?
- Not here.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.456
He called me.

21:27.253 --> 21:28.664
Did he?

21:28.854 --> 21:31.334
Hey, I need your help.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.597
Ah. Aren't you a clever kitty.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.175
Does he know you're doing this?

21:38.364 --> 21:43.609
I only ask because your brother and I
are such close friends now.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.373
Ff lends?

21:47.006 --> 21:49.680
You're the reason
Dean has the Mark of Cain.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.885
Everything that's happening, all of this...

21:53.112 --> 21:55.149
...it's your fault.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.358
So this... Hm.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.861
You've had this coming for a long time.

22:03.355 --> 22:06.029
You really think
I'm frightened of that toothpick?

22:07.960 --> 22:09.871
I don't care.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.740
A hex bag.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.517
By the way...

22:21.040 --> 22:22.485
...she said to tell you...

22:23.175 --> 22:25.052
...she should have taken the three pigs.

22:26.579 --> 22:28.058
Mother.

23:46.825 --> 23:49.101
Dean Winchester.

23:51.797 --> 23:54.243
Welcome to my humble abode.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.478
I thought you were the smart one.

23:59.838 --> 24:02.079
Working with my mother.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.413
Are you insane?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.146
You actually trust her?

24:06.345 --> 24:07.824
Of course not.

24:08.013 --> 24:09.287
Not even a little.

24:10.316 --> 24:12.193
Then why?

24:12.651 --> 24:14.255
What has she got over you?

24:15.254 --> 24:17.325
Will you just die already?

24:21.627 --> 24:22.765
That's what I get.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.341
- What?
- I said...

24:26.632 --> 24:29.374
...that's what I get
for trying to be the good guy.

24:30.102 --> 24:33.606
Wait a second, so you're the good guy?

24:34.873 --> 24:38.013
Do you have any idea
what We been at for the past year?

24:38.777 --> 24:40.688
The changes I've made to hell?

24:40.879 --> 24:43.450
- Am I supposed to be impressed by that?
- Yes!

24:48.320 --> 24:54.134
I thought if I did better...

24:55.294 --> 24:57.900
...I might actually feel something again.

25:00.733 --> 25:01.905
That it might matter.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.511
It doesn't matter.

25:03.902 --> 25:08.373
You know, maybe everybody else forgot
about all the bad you've done...

25:08.574 --> 25:09.644
...but I haven't.

25:11.810 --> 25:15.019
I have watched you kill people, Crowley.
Innocent people.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.387
People I cared about, people I loved.

25:17.916 --> 25:23.059
So, yeah, you have the accent
and the suit and the snark...

25:23.255 --> 25:26.532
...but at the end of it, you are a monster.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.398
Just like all the rest of them.

25:29.661 --> 25:33.575
And I'm gonna watch you die screaming...

25:33.866 --> 25:35.903
...just like all the rest of them.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.746
You're right.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.954
I am a monster...

25:45.177 --> 25:47.680
- Mm.
- ...and I've done bad.

25:47.880 --> 25:53.762
I've done things you can't even imagine.

25:54.553 --> 26:00.060
Horrible, evil, messy things.

26:06.065 --> 26:12.209
And I've loved every damn minute.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.063
So thank you, Sam...

26:27.586 --> 26:31.659
...for reminding me who I really am.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.152
Powerful magic.

26:53.278 --> 26:56.316
It might have worked on any other demon.
But me?

26:56.515 --> 26:58.426
Please.

27:15.667 --> 27:17.669
I could kill you.

27:17.870 --> 27:20.350
Snap my fingers.

27:20.539 --> 27:23.019
Easiest thing in the world.

27:29.548 --> 27:34.019
From here on, I want you to know
that the only reason you're alive...

27:34.219 --> 27:36.324
...is because I allowed it.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.960
And I want you to deliver a message.

27:39.391 --> 27:44.500
You tell that ginger whore
that I gave her a chance to walk away...

27:44.696 --> 27:47.870
...and she spat in my face.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.243
So now...

27:50.469 --> 27:52.881
...she'll never see me coming.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.657
Morning, sunshine.

28:14.560 --> 28:17.564
Monroe Styne. Pleasure.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.540
Ditto.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.742
I'd shake your hand, but, uh...

28:25.437 --> 28:28.748
Mm. Well, I have to say, I am impressed.

28:28.941 --> 28:32.582
The way you charged in here,
all guns blazing.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.951
I'd buy tickets to that show.

28:36.915 --> 28:40.761
You didn't think that was
really gonna work, did you?

28:41.253 --> 28:42.391
Usually does.

28:43.755 --> 28:45.928
Then I guess you know what comes next.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.139
You're gonna play Operation.

28:55.367 --> 28:57.973
It is my favorite game.

28:58.203 --> 29:00.114
Don't do this.

29:00.472 --> 29:06.081
Well, uh, son, we are...
We are past the bargaining stage.

29:06.278 --> 29:08.224
No. The...

29:08.413 --> 29:10.791
The Mark on my arm means that I can't die.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.392
I'm not bargaining.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.587
You flatline me, I will come back.

29:15.787 --> 29:19.064
But I'll come back with black eyes...

29:19.258 --> 29:21.101
...and then you'll all die.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.239
And we'll let you go, then what?

29:23.428 --> 29:26.568
You'll just mosey on down the road?

29:27.232 --> 29:28.575
No.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.940
But I will be human.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.616
So maybe a few of you live.

29:33.805 --> 29:34.909
Maybe.

29:36.408 --> 29:40.254
You make a compelling case,
and, uh, I hope you're right.

29:41.747 --> 29:46.821
Because a man that doesn't die,
well, now, that is a perfect lab rat.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.831
All right.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.626
Let's crack this pinata.

30:23.689 --> 30:28.729
You took someone from me.
Now I'm gonna take everything from you.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.367
It's too late.

30:30.562 --> 30:36.410
Your home, your family, they will...

31:05.430 --> 31:07.273
Hello?

31:10.335 --> 31:11.575
Anybody in here?

31:20.779 --> 31:22.622
Well, all right, then.

31:23.348 --> 31:26.022
Take whatever looks interesting...

31:28.520 --> 31:29.863
...and burn the rest.

31:52.711 --> 31:53.781
It didn't work.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.756
What do you mean?

31:55.947 --> 31:57.984
I mean, that juiced-up hex bag
you gave me...

31:58.216 --> 31:59.752
...Crowley set it on fire.

32:00.285 --> 32:02.287
You're not as tough as
you thought you were.

32:02.487 --> 32:04.728
But you still have him trapped?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.402
Yeah, not so much.

32:07.159 --> 32:08.297
Bloody hell.

32:08.493 --> 32:11.474
What am I supposed to do, Rowena?
How am I supposed to kill him?

32:11.663 --> 32:13.438
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

32:13.632 --> 32:17.136
- What?
- You've got a job to do, Samuel. Get it done.

32:17.803 --> 32:19.441
Rowena.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.922
- Yeah.
- It's me.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.456
Hey.

32:29.648 --> 32:31.924
- Did you find him?
- Not yet.

32:32.517 --> 32:36.761
But I'm at the Styne estate in Louisiana,
and Dean was here.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.593
You sure?

32:39.124 --> 32:40.535
I'm sure.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.296
- How bad is it?
- There are three bodies down here...

32:43.495 --> 32:47.637
...and more than a dozen upstairs in the
main house. He killed... He killed everyone.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.044
And brutally.

32:52.804 --> 32:54.647
All right, I'm on my way.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.786
No, don't bother, Sam.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.785
- The GPS says he's headed north.
Where'?

32:59.978 --> 33:01.548
Home.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.949
Dean's coming home.

33:20.365 --> 33:22.311
Cool.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.682
Hey.

33:28.874 --> 33:31.354
This isn't a damn library.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.015
Yeah, it is.

33:33.211 --> 33:36.385
No reading. Box it or burn it.

33:36.581 --> 33:38.219
Come on.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.085
Dude.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.493
I know this is your first rodeo...

33:42.687 --> 33:45.566
...but man up, okay?

33:45.757 --> 33:47.862
Now, I'm gonna go check out
their sex dungeon.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.595
You stay here and finish up.

33:53.899 --> 33:55.003
Douche.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.246
Heh.

34:06.945 --> 34:11.291
So this is what I know
about Dean Winchester:

34:12.583 --> 34:15.565
He's got crappy taste in music...

34:17.922 --> 34:19.732
...got a hot mom...

34:21.793 --> 34:24.603
...and he loves flannel.

34:28.366 --> 34:31.710
- All right, let's light her up.
- Eldon, wait.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.049
We don't have to.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.478
I know, Cy.

34:40.445 --> 34:42.425
We get to.

34:59.164 --> 35:01.474
- Ungh.
Roscoe?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.648
Well, there he is.

35:13.411 --> 35:16.187
I hope you brought marshmallows.

35:19.818 --> 35:20.853
Been looking for you.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.498
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

35:24.322 --> 35:25.665
Oh, wait.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.428
You're not still sore about, uh...?

35:29.361 --> 35:30.465
What's her name?

35:32.263 --> 35:33.503
Charlie.

35:33.698 --> 35:35.200
Her name was Charlie.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.612
Yeah, well...

35:44.609 --> 35:46.282
...Chucky...

35:46.845 --> 35:48.688
...she got what she deserved.

35:51.950 --> 35:53.861
You wanna know how I did hen'?

35:55.186 --> 35:57.188
- It's a kind of funny story...
- Shut up.

35:58.523 --> 36:00.059
Straight to it then.

36:01.326 --> 36:02.964
I respect that.

36:03.561 --> 36:06.041
See, you got lucky before...

36:07.232 --> 36:08.643
...but this time...

36:09.234 --> 36:12.238
...I'm sporting some new upgrades.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.913
- See, my old man...
- Your old man's dead.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.323
They're all dead.

36:23.581 --> 36:26.187
So you can save me the speech...

36:26.384 --> 36:29.365
...on the three hearts, the two spleens...

36:29.554 --> 36:32.364
...the seven nipples for the ladies.

36:32.557 --> 36:33.900
Or the fellas.

36:34.092 --> 36:36.094
I don't judge.

36:36.761 --> 36:41.369
But even with all that,
you still only have one brain.

36:43.668 --> 36:44.738
So?

36:53.111 --> 36:54.784
No, no, no. Don't. Don't.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.756
Why not? You're one of them.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.725
No. No, I'm not. Okay?

37:00.919 --> 37:02.193
I hate my family.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.628
See? Look. No stitches.

37:05.790 --> 37:08.293
I'm not like them. I promise.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.207
Oh, you are like them.

37:11.396 --> 37:14.707
There's bad in you. it's in your blood.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.778
Now, you can deny it,
and you can run from it all you want...

37:17.969 --> 37:19.073
...but that bad...

37:22.307 --> 37:23.411
...will always win.

37:27.112 --> 37:28.785
I'll do anything you want.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.256
Okay? Please.

37:37.722 --> 37:39.827
You don't need to do this.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.332
Please.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.001
Yeah.

37:52.003 --> 37:53.482
I do.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.590
Dean.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.659
What have you done?

38:27.539 --> 38:28.882
You killed him.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.810
I took down a monster...

38:32.343 --> 38:34.550
...because that's what I do.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.856
And I will continue to do that until...

38:38.650 --> 38:40.652
Until you become the monster.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.527
You can leave now, Cass.

38:44.722 --> 38:47.669
No. I can't.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.304
Because I'm your friend.

38:51.729 --> 38:53.140
Really?

38:53.331 --> 38:56.904
Well, let me ask you something.
You screw over all your friends?

38:57.135 --> 39:00.548
- Sam and I were trying to cure you. We still are.
- Like hell.

39:00.738 --> 39:03.378
- We can read the book now.
- Oh, so what?

39:03.575 --> 39:07.523
So you might find a spell
that might take this crap off my arm?

39:08.646 --> 39:11.559
But even if you do, what's it gonna cost?

39:11.749 --> 39:14.525
Because magic like that does not come free.

39:14.719 --> 39:17.893
No, it comes with a price
that you pay in blood.

39:18.857 --> 39:22.168
- So thanks, but I'm good.
- No.

39:23.862 --> 39:24.897
You're not.

39:25.096 --> 39:28.873
Maybe you could fight the Mark for years,
maybe centuries, like Cain did.

39:29.567 --> 39:31.569
But you cannot fight it forever.

39:32.237 --> 39:36.549
And when you finally turn,
and you will turn...

39:37.909 --> 39:39.286
...Sam...

39:39.777 --> 39:44.522
...and everyone you know, everyone
you love, they could be long dead.

39:46.451 --> 39:48.226
Everyone except me.

39:50.889 --> 39:54.427
I'm the one who will have
to watch you murder the world.

39:54.626 --> 39:58.597
So if there's even a small chance
that we can save you...

39:58.796 --> 40:00.742
...I won't let you walk out of this room.

40:00.932 --> 40:04.106
- Oh, you think you have a choice?
- I think the Mark is changing you.

40:04.302 --> 40:06.908
- You're wrong.
- Am I?

40:07.105 --> 40:11.986
Because the Dean Winchester I know
would never have murdered that kid.

40:14.145 --> 40:18.616
Yeah, well,
that Dean's always been kind of a dick.

40:18.816 --> 40:20.318
Dean...

40:21.452 --> 40:23.955
...I don't wanna have to hurt you.

40:27.825 --> 40:29.896
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.

40:33.798 --> 40:35.141
Dean.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.781
Dean.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.481
Stop.

41:12.036 --> 41:13.777
No.

41:19.177 --> 41:20.679
Dean.

41:21.379 --> 41:22.653
Please.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.208
You and Sam stay the hell away from me.

41:46.404 --> 41:49.044
Next time I won't miss.
