00:50.341 --> 00:53.136

We were both nerds. [chuckles]

like Tupac, like the young Biggie.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.716

In 2019,
Reggie's rap career was really taking off.

01:49.275 --> 01:53.446
He got to open for Katy Perry
and Dua Lipa in India.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.532
-Okay, international artist!
-That's crazy.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.660
Then COVID hit, and all of that stops.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.208
My goals were definitely halted,

02:05.291 --> 02:09.295

I produced more music for other people

02:09.379 --> 02:11.339

02:18.388 --> 02:22.725

a little bit, even the want,

02:22.809 --> 02:25.478
to be an artist anymore.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.813

02:34.946 --> 02:37.490

02:37.574 --> 02:40.493

finding another career.

and how worth it his love for music is.

and then, you know,
being a hip-hop artist is great.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.480
You know what I mean? I think of
Childish Gambino and Pharrell,

07:19.564 --> 07:20.857
it's always, maybe a blazer.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.776
Is that the look
that you would like to keep,

07:23.860 --> 07:26.237
more of a buttoned-up version of you?

07:27.405 --> 07:30.575
I just don't know.
Sometimes I'll go on stage like this,

07:30.658 --> 07:33.369
with, like, some skinny jeans
and a cutoff, more of like a punk rock.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.371

And maybe I can convince you
to come up with a certain vibe.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.902
-Are you a Beyoncé fan?
-Yes, I am. She's good.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.070

are Sasha Fierce's looks.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.366

I was like, "This is good."

08:48.528 --> 08:54.200

recording, mixing, mastering, all of that.

which-- that shows you work hard.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.985
That's very evident. And so,
what was it like for 2020 for you?

09:30.486 --> 09:31.445
Depressing.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.781
I don't know.
I could barely even talk about it.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.701
Still can barely talk about it.
'cause it's still emotionally charged.

09:36.784 --> 09:37.785
Yeah, of course.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.580
[Reggie] I, like, truly love what I did.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.666
[Karamo] "Did" meaning
you used to love it.

09:43.749 --> 09:47.253
Is there something going on there
about your love? Has it wavered?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.213
[exhales]

09:50.506 --> 09:53.009
The whole lockdown,
everything just changed, like,

09:53.092 --> 09:55.720
the underlying frustrations of me,
I'm not out there performing.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.431
-Yeah.
-[Reggie] That feeling of starting over.

09:58.514 --> 10:01.601
It made me question if this is
what I'm supposed to be doing.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.270
-Or if I'm to be doing something else.
-Yeah.

10:04.353 --> 10:08.733
Maybe my goal here
was to be great at a lot of things

10:08.816 --> 10:11.027
and to teach my sons to be better people.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.361
[Karamo] Mmm.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.363
-You have a show coming up?
-[Reggie] Yeah.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.616
Um, Sasha curated it, obviously.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.659
-That's such support and love.
-[Reggie] Yeah.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.703
[Sasha] We got some of
our favorite bands together

10:20.786 --> 10:22.872
to just kind of hit the stage

10:22.955 --> 10:26.000
and give it our all
and get back to the grind.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.376
This is a comeback for you.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.628
Um…

10:29.462 --> 10:30.504
Unsure.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.423
Yeah, that's real.

10:32.506 --> 10:35.843
Stripped away your confidence
and trust in a lot of areas.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.970
-Yeah, for sure.
-"So why would I be confident?"

10:38.054 --> 10:39.430
Right, right, right, right, right.

10:40.389 --> 10:42.516
Oh, my God.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.060
[Antoni] Oh, my God.

10:44.852 --> 10:45.895
Whoa!

10:45.978 --> 10:47.647
We can play a game of "Never Have I Ever."

10:47.730 --> 10:51.317
Never have I ever seen
a table saw in a kitchen cabinet.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.319
It was literally like this.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.488
A circular saw?

10:56.197 --> 10:58.282
It might be a table saw.
It might be circular saw.

10:58.366 --> 11:02.078
But it is a thing that is in a kitchen
when it probably should be in a garage.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.496
I'll say that.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.790
Your hair is so beautiful.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.667
-Thank you.
-Skin, poppin'.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.711
I use coconut oil. That's it.
Literally all over my whole body.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.756
Okay, but I also love
your baby pick moment.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.384
Not a baby pick, but I love that
there's a gorgeous pick in there.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.426
I love that as well.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.721
It's very much Black joy, very much
gorgeous resistance, "This is who I am."

11:20.805 --> 11:21.681
Yes.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.101
I wanna help nurture that.
When's the last time you had a haircut?

11:25.184 --> 11:28.938
Last time I had a haircut was right
before I went to the Katy Perry show.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.606
Oh, so major.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.442
I go and get my hair trimmed,
and they leave me with an inch of hair.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.612
My wife thought it was better.

11:36.696 --> 11:37.863
Who does that?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.740
After that haircut,
you know what I mean,

11:39.824 --> 11:41.992
a lot of stuff went down,
my confidence or whatever.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.286
You lost a little bit
of your gorgeous authenticities.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.413
[Reggie] Right. Mm-hmm.

11:45.496 --> 11:49.083
Like, I feel like not everyone has
the beautiful hair that you have,

11:49.166 --> 11:51.752
and I do love that, like, it's signature,

11:51.836 --> 11:55.214
but I wanna explore
other things we could do to even, like,

11:55.297 --> 11:56.882
help you find your vibe even more.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.801
I am definitely open for that.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.219
[Tan] Ooh!

12:00.302 --> 12:03.472
-[Karamo] Do you know how to do a diaper?
-I… do.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.724
-[Karamo] Do you?
-[Tan] Yes.

12:04.807 --> 12:08.352
-[Karamo] Wah! I peed myself. Wah!
-[Tan] Goes like this.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.104
-Then you take…
-[Karamo] I gotta poopie.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.272
[both laughing]

12:11.355 --> 12:12.565
[Tan] Oh, no, it won't stick!

12:12.648 --> 12:14.275
[Karamo] Tan, you have a child on the way!

12:14.358 --> 12:17.278
-He's just gonna have to go diaperless.
-[laughs]

12:17.361 --> 12:19.405
-[Bobby] It's your first home together?
-[Reggie] Yes.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.366
-How's that been?
-Fixing stuff myself, it's crazy.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.620
The kitchen is where
we need the most help. [laughs]

12:26.704 --> 12:28.038
Visually, it's not bad.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.957
I've got good bones to work with.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.542
I love a nice open floor plan.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.461
So people hang out there.
You can cook in here.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.045
We spend a lot of time here.

12:36.338 --> 12:38.174
[Bobby] Noticing a love for elephants.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.760
[Reggie] Yes, we selected elephants
for the nursery

12:40.843 --> 12:42.803
because they're strong, intelligent,

12:42.887 --> 12:45.431
and I wanted my children
to instill those same values.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.808
-[Bobby] You and Sasha are in here too?
-Yes.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.854
This room is really special to us
because Sasha had the baby in this room.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.063
Wow!

12:53.606 --> 12:55.816
So, this room's special,
and you want me not to touch it?

12:55.900 --> 12:56.901
[Reggie] Um…

12:57.485 --> 13:00.362
-Because I'm fine with that.
-I think it's pretty special.

13:00.446 --> 13:03.908
This is where I make everything happen
as far as my career.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.075
And this is working for you?

13:05.159 --> 13:07.161
-Um, a little bit.
<i>-</i>[chuckles] A little bit.

13:07.244 --> 13:10.623
-It's definitely a black and gray room.
-No, which I love. That's totally my vibe.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.166
-Right, right.
-Cool, cool, cool.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.294
-Limited distractions for making music.
-What about, like, for acoustics?

13:15.377 --> 13:17.296
-It could be better.
-Okay, okay.

13:17.379 --> 13:18.672
I think it's a great house.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.967
I think it has a lot of potential.
We're gonna get rid of all that orange.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.928
That's one
of the first things we're gonna do.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.347
[Antoni] And how was it
during the pandemic?

13:26.430 --> 13:29.308
Like, who's taking care of
most of, like, preparing the food?

13:29.391 --> 13:31.685
-Oh, that was me, and my son as well.
-Mm-hmm.

13:31.769 --> 13:35.689
He first started cooking breakfast,
like, around six to seven years old.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.317
And after that, it was like,
"You're cooking breakfast."

13:38.400 --> 13:39.401
That's awesome.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.822
Yeah, obviously when he's cooking a lot,
he's like, "Dad, come help me." I'm his…

13:42.905 --> 13:45.199
-Sous chef.
-Right, sous chef. Exactly. His sous chef.

13:45.282 --> 13:48.869
I'm his sous chef. He would definitely
like to become a chef one day.

13:48.953 --> 13:52.498
I think it's so special
that at such a young age,

13:52.581 --> 13:54.667
he has his thing
that he's really passionate about,

13:54.750 --> 13:56.335
which he clearly gets from you.

13:56.418 --> 14:00.756
I always love it when you have parents
who are deeply passionate about something,

14:00.840 --> 14:03.926
and you see their kids have
their own things that they really love.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.096
You see that they feel
very comfortable sort of exploring that,

14:07.179 --> 14:08.889
and that's so clear in this house.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.183
Is food, like, your own passion,
or is it something

14:11.267 --> 14:15.271
that you feel like your whole family
kind of shares that thing together?

14:15.354 --> 14:18.691
I feel like the whole family
kind of shares that,

14:18.774 --> 14:22.987
but I feel like, that, like,
I am just a bigger source…

14:23.070 --> 14:25.239
<i>-…</i>than my dad is. He barely cooks now.
-[Antoni] Gotcha.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.867
[Reggie and Antoni laughing]

14:27.950 --> 14:31.579
Just a little bit of shade for Dad.
That's fine. Why doesn't Dad cook as much?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.581
Well, because I can cook better than him.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.332
-Okay, I appreciate that.
-[Reggie laughs]

14:35.916 --> 14:38.419
What's your favorite thing
to make with your dad?

14:38.502 --> 14:41.881
Like, red meat. I just don't know why,
but I'm just really attracted to it.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.509
I love the fact that
you're super passionate about food.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.595
Would you be willing to join us this week?

14:47.678 --> 14:48.888
Yes, that seems like fun.

14:48.971 --> 14:49.847
Yes.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.518
[Bobby] Y'all make pretty babies.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.062
Tan has a husband,
but I feel like this looks good together.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.314
Like, if this was our baby.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.316
[Tan] I'm not gonna have one.
Gonna take yours.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.527
-That's fine, right?
-You can have him about two weeks.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.030
-Take him and pay me child support.
-[Sasha] We're gonna sleep.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.865
He'll have a lovely English accent.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.992
I'll give him back
when he's, like, 17, 18.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.201
[Reggie laughs]

15:11.285 --> 15:13.621
You guys, thank you so much
for letting us into your home.

Now we know, uh, I think,
what we wanna help you with.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.375
-[Karamo laughs]
-[Tan] So, we'll head out.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.543
Thank you so much, my love.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.754
-Reggie, you're with us.
-[Reggie] Let's go.

-Bye.
-[Jonathan] Bye, Reggie III, Sasha.

15:23.505 --> 15:24.757

living room that doesn't function for you?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.046
[Sasha] I think the crowding of it.

17:27.629 --> 17:30.132
Okay. So, you know,
a lot of times in a smaller space,

17:30.215 --> 17:32.384
it is best to do a built-in sectional.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.762

the wall and then the cushion.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.354

[Antoni] This is a new hotel.
It's called the Line Hotel.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.366
A chef named Kristen Kish
opened up her restaurant here,

18:37.449 --> 18:38.992
Arlo Grey, not too long ago.

18:39.076 --> 18:43.080
Here on this wall, she actually has
recipes from when she started cooking.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.165
She was 17, and she kept notes.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.668
[Little Reggie] I've never been
in a place like this ever.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.295
-[Antoni] How cool is it, though?
-[Little Reggie] Very cool.

18:50.879 --> 18:51.797
So…

18:51.880 --> 18:53.298
[Little Reggie] Look at the spices.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.342
Reggie, Little Reggie is gonna be cooking.

18:55.425 --> 18:58.011
-But you're gonna be taking notes.
-Taking notes.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.264
Sounds great.
Sorry you gotta read my handwriting.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.598
[Antoni and Reggie laughing]

19:01.682 --> 19:04.518
I want Little Reggie
to feel like a boss in the kitchen.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.812
I want his father
to be able to experience that with him.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.273
'Cause if Reggie sees his son succeeding,

19:09.356 --> 19:11.608
I really think he's gonna
want that for himself as well.

19:11.692 --> 19:15.070
So, we're actually gonna be
roasting a whole filet mignon.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.572
There are two parts to this recipe:

19:16.655 --> 19:20.117
One is the beef
and the second one is the sauce.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.493
-You ready?
-Mm-hmm.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.954
[Antoni] Pour the olive oil. There you go.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.206
I always like to season it
aggressively on the outside.

19:26.790 --> 19:27.791
You can pat that down,

19:27.875 --> 19:31.461
just to really get the salt
and the pepper in there. Beautiful.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.715
Since we're roasting it,
we're just gonna sear it a little bit.

19:34.798 --> 19:38.635
Plop it right in there to develop
that crust to just keep all the juices in.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.180
-[sizzling]
-Oh, I love that sound.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.182
So, we have some beautiful browning here.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.517
So it was about four
to five minutes on that side?

19:45.601 --> 19:47.060
[Antoni] Yeah, three to five minutes.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.855
-This is gonna go into an oven at 425.
-[Reggie] Uh-huh.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.192
[Antoni] Know what this is?

19:53.275 --> 19:55.152
-[Little Reggie] Shallots.
-It is a shallot.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.738
-All right.
-[Antoni] You look like a chef.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.407
-You're doing a good job.
-[Antoni] You're doing a great job.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.492
And then three tablespoons of white wine

20:02.576 --> 20:04.912
and then two tablespoons
of white wine vinegar.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.957
I'm gonna need three egg yolks.

20:09.041 --> 20:09.875
Okay.

20:09.958 --> 20:11.835
Crack the whole eggs into the bowl,

20:11.919 --> 20:14.922
and then you're gonna gently scoop
your fingers under the yolk

20:15.005 --> 20:18.258
and just slide the yolk really gently
from one hand to the next

20:18.342 --> 20:20.510
so that all the egg whites dribble off.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.596
-Oh, there you go.
-Beautiful.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.056
For every one of these egg yolks,

20:24.139 --> 20:26.683
we're gonna add
about a tablespoon of water.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.603
And now, you're just gonna
keep on whisking the béarnaise.

20:29.686 --> 20:32.940
That's perfect.
And Dad is gonna chop some tarragon.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.318
-Do you wanna be a chef someday?
-[Little Reggie] Yes.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.321
-You do?
-Yep, I wanna go to a cooking school.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.656
-[Antoni] Really?
-Mm-hmm.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.950
[Reggie] He has talked about
cooking for the family a lot.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.827
I'm sure that's where it's gonna start,
but it definitely is gonna branch

20:45.911 --> 20:48.038
into bigger
and better things when he gets older.

20:48.121 --> 20:52.292
But I love that he has drive and ambition,
and he has something that he loves doing.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.210
Like you.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.254
-[Little Reggie] Mm-hmm.
-[Antoni] Meat is ready.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.257
[Reggie] How long should we let beef rest?

20:58.340 --> 20:59.758
-About seven to ten minutes.
-Okay.

20:59.841 --> 21:03.262
[Antoni] I'm gonna check on this.
It's really thickened up a lot.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.596
See how it nicely coats?

21:04.680 --> 21:07.057
So you get little chunks there.
That means it's ready.

21:07.140 --> 21:10.394
So now you're gonna grab our white wine
vinegar-shallot-tarragon mixture

21:10.477 --> 21:13.272
and you're gonna
plop it right in there. Excellent.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.483
And I'm gonna add clarified butter.

21:17.067 --> 21:19.111
-[Little Reggie] A little bit more.
-[laughs]

21:19.194 --> 21:20.737
-There we are.
-[Antoni] I respect that.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.991
Passions are so important,
and I get it from your wife as well.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.743
Like, it's something that
you highly encourage in your kids.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.162
[Reggie] Definitely, and he's found this.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.039
It's definitely
gonna help me do what I do.

21:31.123 --> 21:35.252
-He can cook while I'm doing my thing.
-Right. Okay.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.879
-Look how beautiful and thick.
-[Little Reggie] Crazy.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.465
[Antoni] Gonna season it
with a little bit of salt.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.467
And then I like to do about an inch.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.760
You got it. You got it.

21:45.012 --> 21:45.846
That's so good.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.473
-[Little Reggie] Wow, I did that.
-[laughs]

21:53.395 --> 21:54.771
-So good.
-So good.

on your music because, uh…

Little Reggie's got dinner covered.

-Yeah, that was really good.

[Karamo] His first show in over a year.

into this space before he performs

so that he can get on stage

23:01.546 --> 23:05.384
"Reggie, you need to sit down
and rethink your life."

23:05.467 --> 23:10.847
I need to stay balanced so that I can keep
my wife good so she can have her career

23:10.931 --> 23:12.766
and have the economy of our house going.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.059
-Yeah.
-You know what I mean?

23:14.142 --> 23:18.313
I understand that exact feeling that
there's a stress that you have as a man,

23:18.397 --> 23:20.899
but, like, your wife just rocks with you,

23:20.982 --> 23:25.362
and for the person you're with to support
that dream 100%, it's a rare thing.

23:26.405 --> 23:30.200
That's you stopping yourself, 'cause
you know you got somebody in your corner.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.118
Right.

23:31.868 --> 23:33.286
So, what's blocking you?

23:34.162 --> 23:38.625
[chuckles] Dreaming big has,
I guess, emotionally hurt me.

23:39.209 --> 23:40.085
Yeah.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.672
The logical brain comes on,
"If it hurt you, why are you continuing?"

23:44.548 --> 23:46.049
But, um, you know,

23:46.133 --> 23:48.677
my son has this cooking thing
that he's very passionate about.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.346
My wife is an author.
She's very passionate about that.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.391
And it's like, if I gave up on my dream,

23:54.933 --> 23:56.393
what is that saying to them?

23:56.476 --> 24:00.564
What does it say
to young Reggie if you don't give up,

24:01.189 --> 24:02.649
but you don't believe?

24:04.234 --> 24:06.027
Because you're sending
that message as well.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.117
"If you get burnt in the kitchen,
I mean, you can still keep cooking,

24:12.200 --> 24:14.953
but don't believe you're ever gonna
have your own restaurant one day."

24:17.497 --> 24:19.082
Never say that to him, but, yeah.

24:19.166 --> 24:23.044
I know, but sometimes we inadvertently
pick up on what our parents do.

24:24.588 --> 24:27.174
And what he's gonna pick up on now is,

24:27.257 --> 24:31.052
"Work hard, but don't really believe
anything's ever gonna come of it."

24:32.637 --> 24:37.559
Through life,
I just worked hard to get everything.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.980
And all the work I've put in
is just coming to a screeching halt.

24:42.564 --> 24:44.608
You know what I mean?
And not even my fault.

24:46.693 --> 24:48.403
The thing that you've been doing, saying,

24:48.487 --> 24:50.739
"I work hard every day,
but there's no guarantee…"

24:50.822 --> 24:51.823
You gotta switch that,

24:51.907 --> 24:55.327
because that guy in January of 2019
that was working hard

24:55.410 --> 24:57.579
was in India with Katy Perry and Dua Lipa.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.333
Did that guy back there
know that he'd be on stage in India?

25:02.125 --> 25:03.502
-No clue.
-None.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.296

-You did?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.841
-Yeah.
-And it happened.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.552
So, you gotta just trust and believe.

25:12.636 --> 25:14.304
I want you to picture this right now.

25:14.387 --> 25:17.557
Visualize how you felt
when you walked off that stage.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.728
It was the highest I've ever been.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.898
I almost didn't even feel
the steps or the ground.

25:24.981 --> 25:27.651
It's just like,
I floated back to the trailer.

because it's so easy to see the negative.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.785
Right, yes.

25:36.910 --> 25:39.829
You gotta visualize that moment
that you floated off a stage

25:39.913 --> 25:41.790
and the crowd was loving you.

25:41.873 --> 25:44.626
And when you get there, say to yourself,

give me the best moments of my life."

That me and my family are gonna
make it through my career, her career

26:00.392 --> 26:02.561
and still be balanced. And you know,

26:03.311 --> 26:06.898
to have a whole lot more experiences
of me walking off stage,

26:07.691 --> 26:09.192

I like this.
Now you starting to dream again.

-Thank you.

27:53.129 --> 27:55.507
I want people to get excited
when they see you thinking,

27:55.590 --> 27:56.800
"He looks like an artist."

27:56.883 --> 27:58.677
-I see where you're going.
-Right? Right?

27:58.760 --> 28:01.971
You know, I, kind of,
don't know what I want, maybe? [laughs]

28:02.055 --> 28:05.100
Okay, so I would like you to shop.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.894
I just wanna to see the kind of things
that you gravitate towards,

28:07.977 --> 28:10.980
based on who you are, the artist.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.565
What do you wanna convey?

28:12.649 --> 28:13.650
This is kind of nice.

28:13.733 --> 28:15.694
-I love the orange on it.
-I like that too.

28:15.777 --> 28:18.071
-What is that, burnt sienna?
-Yeah. Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!

28:18.154 --> 28:21.908
It gives me hope seeing him
pull out really bold items

28:21.991 --> 28:23.785
that honestly,
I would never have expected.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.079
-It's definitely eye-catching.
-I love it. Okay, good.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.706
Maybe the concern was that

28:27.789 --> 28:31.960
he didn't have the self-esteem to wear
what he actually wants to wear on stage.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.840
[laughs] Well, you have the confidence
of a performer. That's good.

28:37.590 --> 28:38.967
Does it work or does it not work?

28:39.050 --> 28:42.512
Yes, this actually works.
And this is one that Reggie would wear,

28:43.138 --> 28:44.222
along with BlackLight.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.933
[Tan] The reason why I like
a pajama-style pant is

28:47.016 --> 28:48.768
it is brutally hot here.

28:48.852 --> 28:52.021
-Oh, yes.
-It's probably more brutally hot on stage.

28:52.105 --> 28:55.191
And so at least it gives you
a little bit more comfort.

28:55.275 --> 28:58.194
I love this, actually. Now, the more
I look at it, I'm kind of enjoying it.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.904
Yay, that makes me so happy! [laughs]

28:59.988 --> 29:01.239
You know what it reminds me of?

29:01.322 --> 29:04.284
I'm not trying to turn you
into this person… André 3000.

29:04.367 --> 29:06.828
-[scoffs] One of my favorite rappers.
-Oh, really?

29:06.911 --> 29:08.371
-All right.
-Yeah, I love it.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.540
I'm gonna make sure
in your closet you have everything

29:10.623 --> 29:12.208
that's gonna make you feel good on stage.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.334
Sounds great.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.546
-[soul music playing]
-[vocalizing]

29:20.842 --> 29:22.594
This is called Birds Barbershop.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.971
Super cute.
Have you ever been here before?

29:25.054 --> 29:26.431
-No. [laughs]
-You haven't?

29:26.514 --> 29:29.893
-Come on in. George. How are you?
-Hey, how you doing?

29:29.976 --> 29:32.020
-Reggie, George. George, Reggie.
-Nice to meet you.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.063
[Jonathan] Can I touch your hair?

29:34.147 --> 29:36.191
-Of course.
-[Jonathan] I'm obsessed with your Afro.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.525
I feel like it stands out.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.277
I feel like I don't see it every day.

29:39.360 --> 29:43.114
But I feel like this hair is,
like, going over your ear a little.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.242
Almost like a gorgeous, like,
Black man, Princess Leia moment.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.161
It's starting
to give me bun over your ear.

29:48.244 --> 29:50.038
Yeah, I get it. [laughs]

29:50.121 --> 29:55.001
The point is we'll take this a tiny
bit in, like, a little, teeny-tiny bit.

29:55.084 --> 29:56.461
And then this back hairline in,

29:56.544 --> 29:58.671
kind of 1970s-inspired,
like, Afro-centric moment

29:58.755 --> 30:00.799
where really we keep all of this length.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.675
-Okay.
-[Jonathan] It keeps your options open.

30:02.759 --> 30:05.970
You can braid it down. You can lock it up.
You can do a little twist.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.931
You can do all sorts
of different things with it,

30:08.014 --> 30:10.725
which I think as an artist
is, like, a good thing.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.268
I'm digging it so far.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.770
We're not taking your hair off.

30:13.853 --> 30:16.856
I will literally side tackle his ass
if the hair starts to come too short.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.192
Because I--
I actually would never do that.

30:19.275 --> 30:22.153
Actually I could if it really starts--
Whatever. Focus, Jonathan.

30:23.196 --> 30:27.575
This is all about helping him
embody the music that he creates,

30:27.659 --> 30:31.162
which is about resilience,
joy, confidence.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.039
Wait, so tell me about the show.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.041
When's the last time you've been on stage?

30:35.124 --> 30:36.918
[Reggie] It's been a long time.

30:37.001 --> 30:39.337
-Performing at the Austin Hip Hop Awards.
-[whirring]

30:39.420 --> 30:41.673
And then two months later, COVID.

30:41.756 --> 30:45.051
I was thinking about your experience
and having the universe just kind of

30:45.134 --> 30:46.678
pull the plug on touring

30:46.761 --> 30:50.640
and, like, so much of the music industry
in the way that it had classically been.

30:50.723 --> 30:53.643
But that everyone has
such a different path,

30:53.726 --> 30:55.687
and everyone has so many,
like, different setbacks

30:55.770 --> 30:57.397
and so many different, like, experiences.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.691
-Right.
-That inertia is still there.

30:59.774 --> 31:03.653
And there's no reason to believe that,
like, you're not gonna have more "yes."

31:03.736 --> 31:05.196
So, I guess I'm just saying, like,

31:05.280 --> 31:08.366
it's important for us
to stay connected to our passions.

31:08.449 --> 31:09.576
Just keep going.

31:09.659 --> 31:11.828
Oh, my God. That looks really good.
Thank you so much.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.122
I really like that disconnection.
It's really sexy.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.374
-[laughs]
-Look at you, for crying out loud.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.417
Yeah, I'm digging this.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.003
See this confidence a-brewing, honey. Yes!

31:20.086 --> 31:22.255
[laughing]

31:22.338 --> 31:26.092
Hi. I'm Captain Confidence, Reggie,
and welcome to <i>Queer Eye</i>.

31:26.801 --> 31:29.178
Yeah, I'm gonna do
a gorgeous moisture mask.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.973
Confidence is something
that comes from our inside.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.224
It's a state of being.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.060
We just have to help
to, like, propel him forward.

31:36.144 --> 31:39.647
He just needs to do a round off
back handspring layout into his destiny.

31:39.731 --> 31:43.026
Except like, the R&B, rap,
hip-hop version of that.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.444
Yes.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.614
[Reggie] Do I look handsome?

31:47.697 --> 31:50.658
Okay, I'm, like, honestly not even
doing this, like, to be extra.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.577
Like, I actually did just get,
like, a flutter.

31:52.660 --> 31:54.704
Like, you really look amazing.

31:55.496 --> 31:56.956
Uh!

31:57.040 --> 31:58.249
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready.

31:58.333 --> 32:02.086
For the new Reggie in three, two, one.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.174
Whoa.

32:06.883 --> 32:07.717
I love it.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.136
[Jonathan] Look at your texture
from the hydration.

32:10.219 --> 32:11.387
It's super curly.

32:12.513 --> 32:13.348
Wow.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.266
Your hair just wasn't hydrated.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.226
-Oil and water repel each other.
-Mm-hmm.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.354
So actually when you coat your hair
in coconut oil,

32:19.437 --> 32:22.231
it actually can prevent softening
ingredients from getting in it.

32:22.315 --> 32:23.441
from shampoo and conditioner.

32:23.524 --> 32:25.568
-Because it gets this barrier on it.
-Mm-hmm.

32:25.652 --> 32:28.196
So, when I put that moisturizer
on your hair, it just was like…

32:28.279 --> 32:29.489
[inhales]

32:29.572 --> 32:33.117
And also for Friday,
we can pick it out big. We can go big.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.286
I love it. Thank you.

32:35.870 --> 32:36.788
We do have…

32:36.871 --> 32:41.209
Oh, my God. I don't know
if I can, like, even handle, like, uh, uh…

32:41.292 --> 32:44.796
Let me pose.
I should've been a model, right? [laughs]

32:44.879 --> 32:48.883
Well, I can't be, like, spoiler alert,

32:48.967 --> 32:53.888
but I will just say, we do have one
more surprise for us to go to together.

32:53.972 --> 32:54.806
Let's do this.

32:54.889 --> 32:58.768
<i>♪ 'Cause it makes me feel good</i>
<i>Makes me feel all right… ♪</i>

32:58.851 --> 33:01.479
-[Jonathan] After you.
-[Reggie] Thank you.

33:01.562 --> 33:04.107
-[Tan] You look so good!
-[all shouting]

33:04.649 --> 33:06.818
You look so good!

33:06.901 --> 33:09.612
-[Karamo] You look so good.
-[Tan] You did such a good job.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.280
It's fantastic.

33:11.364 --> 33:13.241
-[Karamo] Yeah.
-It's just a clean look.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.159
[Jonathan] Now, what we're here to do is…

33:15.243 --> 33:17.829
-[hums fanfare, laughs]
-[Karamo] We're gonna do a photo shoot!

33:17.912 --> 33:20.206
-Yes, I needed more pictures.
-Everything.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.916
[Jonathan] We're gonna chaîné turn over.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.836
Yeah, this is how we do it.
See? Turn like this.

33:24.919 --> 33:27.213
-I'm just gonna do this.
-Yeah, you do your thing.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.716
-[all laughing]
-[Jonathan] We're obsessed with Hannah.

33:29.799 --> 33:31.509
-I'm Jane.
-[Reggie] Nice to meet you.

33:31.592 --> 33:34.804
[Karamo] I've already tested for you with
the light to make sure that it was cute.

33:34.887 --> 33:37.640
So this is about,
like, defining who's BlackLight

33:37.724 --> 33:39.600
and the guy
who lives in the rest of the world.

33:39.684 --> 33:40.810
Should we get you ready?

33:40.893 --> 33:42.520
-[Reggie] Let's do it.
-Let's. Yes, please.

33:42.603 --> 33:46.482
So, the thing I liked about
what you gravitated towards at the store

33:46.566 --> 33:48.609
was you liked something that was bold.

33:48.693 --> 33:52.530
So, you pick an outfit
based on who you are as BlackLight.

33:52.613 --> 33:53.448
-Okay.
-Play.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.241
-Sounds great.
-Show me what you like.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.326
Ready or not, here Tan comes.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.121
Show these dum-dums
what you've got on. [chuckles]

34:00.204 --> 34:01.414
-[gasps]
-[Bobby] Cute.

34:01.497 --> 34:04.292
-I like this one. I like this look.
-Is that a heel?

34:04.375 --> 34:06.961
[Tan] He said he wanted a heeled boot,
gonna give him some height.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.839
[Antoni] I love the cardigan,
giving me a little bit

34:09.922 --> 34:12.633
of Childish Gambino
meets Frank Ocean, but you.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.470
-I'm fine with all of that.
-[all laughing]

34:15.553 --> 34:17.764
[Tan] We are taking new shots
for his website,

34:17.847 --> 34:19.432
new shots for his promotional material,

34:19.515 --> 34:24.312
so he can feel like when he gets
back into the world as BlackLight,

34:24.395 --> 34:27.065
it is a complete package.

34:27.148 --> 34:30.068
[Jonathan] When you're doing photo shoots,
you wanna embody a character.

34:30.151 --> 34:31.903
That speaks to what Karamo was saying.

34:31.986 --> 34:34.280
Yes, let's start off with that.
Who is BlackLight?

34:35.948 --> 34:36.991
An aggressive rapper.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.410
I don't think that'd be
the only adjective I'd give for you.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.746
I just wanna hear it from you.
You tell me.

34:43.498 --> 34:45.500
I'm just a lyricist. I mean… [laughs]

34:45.583 --> 34:48.586
A lyricist. When we think "lyricist,"
what do we think? We think "smooth."

34:48.669 --> 34:50.922
-We think "carefree."
-Yeah, "smooth."

34:51.005 --> 34:53.341
-[Reggie] "Poise."
-"Poise, smooth, carefree."

34:53.424 --> 34:57.095
Those adjectives I feel like you can bring
with your poses that say "BlackLight."

34:57.178 --> 34:59.764
Ease us in. So, let's see
what that looks like to you now.

35:01.140 --> 35:04.143
-Have you heard BlackLight rap in person?
-[Bobby] No.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.437
Give me a moment.
Can you just give them, like, a hot…

35:06.521 --> 35:08.064
Okay.

35:08.147 --> 35:08.981
[Tan] I love that.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.691
Uh, let's see.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.485
So many verses come to mind.

35:13.069 --> 35:15.029
♪ <i>BlackLight</i>
<i>The opposition ain't nothing funny ♪</i>

35:15.113 --> 35:16.364

35:32.839 --> 35:35.049
[Jonathan] So, do that more,
but now do it for images.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.302
-So, like, hold some of those vibes.
-[Karamo] You were naturally doing those.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.887
Look at this.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.430
-[Reggie] Oh, that's dope.
-[Tan] See?

35:41.514 --> 35:44.433
[Karamo] You seem like you
have your own style. Sexy, smooth.

35:44.517 --> 35:45.351
[Jonathan] Yes.

35:45.434 --> 35:49.147
There's a bit of aggression in there<i>,</i>
but I don't know if aggression's the word.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.731
-[Hannah] Power.
-[Karamo] It's power.

35:50.815 --> 35:54.443
That's the word I was looking for.
It's not aggression, it's power.

35:54.527 --> 35:56.487
-[Reggie] I love that. It's great.
-Honestly.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.239
I never would've come up with that ever.

35:58.322 --> 35:59.615
This looks like BlackLight

35:59.699 --> 36:02.702
and doesn't look like Reggie
who we see the rest of the time.

36:02.785 --> 36:05.830
-Yeah, it's like two different people.
-[Karamo] Yes, BlackLight.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.415
[Hannah] It's really crazy.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.084
<i>♪ Said</i> <i>I</i> <i>got a lotta problems</i>
<i>I didn't catch the magic…</i> ♪

36:10.168 --> 36:11.002
Yes!

36:11.085 --> 36:13.796
For the first time since meeting Reggie,

36:13.880 --> 36:16.632
I'm seeing BlackLight.
I'm seeing the performer.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.551
-Hit it. Get it. Hey!
-[Tan laughs]

36:18.634 --> 36:21.804
I think that he just needed
something to hang his hat on,

36:21.888 --> 36:24.223

36:26.100 --> 36:29.145
-[Jonathan] Yes! Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!
-Oh, yeah.

Hello! Get out of my face.

36:33.274 --> 36:35.943
Welcome to the era of BlackLight, honey.
It is upon us.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.695

-[Bobby] Amazing.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.488
[Hannah] Your energy is so different.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.656

-[Tan] I know.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.241

37:24.617 --> 37:26.869
-[Bobby] So, I know you guys liked color.
-[Reggie] Mm-hmm.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.746
[Bobby] But I added
a brighter, happier color.

37:28.829 --> 37:30.331
[Reggie] Right. It is. Definitely.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.708
Look at this sectional.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.043
[Reggie] This is so good.

37:34.126 --> 37:35.544
[Bobby] I had this custom built.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.672
[Tan] You're the only one
in the world with this?

37:37.755 --> 37:39.173
Sasha is gonna flip.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.383
[Bobby] I hope in a good way.

37:40.466 --> 37:43.803
Everything is so great.
The fixture over the table!

37:45.554 --> 37:46.514
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.268
I'm gonna take him. He's coming with me.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.270
-We found him together.
-Did you?

37:52.853 --> 37:55.982
[Bobby] In the kitchen, white cabinets.
They're gonna be easier to clean.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.984
[Reggie] That's awesome. I love the color.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.568
[Bobby] You got all new appliances.

37:59.652 --> 38:02.280
A dishwasher
that's no longer just a drying rack.

38:02.363 --> 38:03.197
And look.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.533
-[Reggie] And it doesn't shake.
-[Bobby] No, it doesn't.

38:05.616 --> 38:08.286
[Antoni] A handle on the microwave.

38:08.369 --> 38:09.870
This is huge.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.914
-Slow clap for that.
-[laughs]

38:11.998 --> 38:12.832

38:18.296 --> 38:19.547
Oh, my God.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.220
-I love all of this.
-[Bobby] Right?

38:26.304 --> 38:27.430
Oh, it sounds great already.

38:27.513 --> 38:30.391
I know, right? You don't hear
the outside world at all anymore.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.226
-[Karamo] See your computer?
-[Reggie] What?

38:32.310 --> 38:34.645
-[Karamo] Boom!
-[Reggie sighs]

38:35.938 --> 38:37.690
-Thank you guys so much.
-[Tan laughs]

38:37.773 --> 38:40.151
I can't wait to make music
on this thing now.

38:42.236 --> 38:43.863
-[Karamo] The concert's coming up.
-Mm-hmm.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.323
How are you feeling now?

38:45.406 --> 38:48.659
I can say that
I have started to daydream again,

38:48.743 --> 38:52.204
or I have started
to visualize myself on stages.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.664
So, like, it's a work in progress.

38:53.748 --> 38:54.999
The more practice you do,

38:55.082 --> 38:57.918
the more visualization of what's
in front of you, what's possible.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.837
Those daydreams
are gonna turn into big dreams,

38:59.920 --> 39:01.756
and you're gonna believe more and more.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.509
I feel like now, when you say that to me,

39:05.593 --> 39:07.970
I definitely feel it's more achievable.

39:08.554 --> 39:11.057
-It's not so impossible to get to.
-Good.

39:11.849 --> 39:13.059
Bring it.

39:13.142 --> 39:14.602
[Reggie] Thanks, brother.

39:15.186 --> 39:18.731
We came to play, all right?
So your hair, it's looking stunning.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.941
-Mm-hmm.
-I love how it looks from yesterday.

39:21.025 --> 39:23.527
This is three-quarters water,
one-quarter conditioner.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.112
So if you just look in the mirror,

39:25.196 --> 39:29.450
you can just gently mist this
through your curls to refresh

39:29.533 --> 39:32.161
and give you some hydration. Oh!

39:34.622 --> 39:36.707
-[Tan] Hi, Reg.
-[Reggie] How you doing?

39:36.791 --> 39:39.418
Yesterday shocked me.

39:39.502 --> 39:42.380
Like, you turned into somebody
that I see is as aspirational.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.965
I think, "Oh, I want that kind of energy.
I want that vibe."

39:45.049 --> 39:47.176
I want that to be translated
into your clothes as well.

39:47.259 --> 39:50.304
So, everything you see here is bold.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.974
There's so much print here
that's gonna make you stand out.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.728
I've got you colors that were
complementary of the print.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.772
There's brown in that.
There's black in that.

39:59.855 --> 40:01.315
"I'll find a brown pant."
-Mm-hmm.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.067
"I'll find a black pant."

40:03.150 --> 40:05.277
You'll pull out colors
from the print itself.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.405
-That's how you'll build your look.
-Okay.

40:07.488 --> 40:12.827
And so, tonight, I'm gonna leave you
to dress yourself for the event.

40:12.910 --> 40:14.328
-Okay.
-So…

40:14.412 --> 40:16.414
the one thing I wanted to put you in now

40:16.497 --> 40:19.834
is a slick,
artist-appropriate version of a suit.

40:19.917 --> 40:21.877
-We want Reggie!
-[Tan] Come join me!

40:21.961 --> 40:23.629
-Wow!
-Oh!

40:24.213 --> 40:26.298
-[Bobby] This is hot.
-[Antoni] Obsessed.

40:26.382 --> 40:29.468
-The color is breathtaking on you.
-The colors look beautiful on you.

40:29.552 --> 40:30.636
You wanna see the 360?

40:30.719 --> 40:31.679
-We do!
-Yes!

40:31.762 --> 40:34.807
-Yes! Full twirl. Yes!
-[Bobby] Yes, spin, Daddy, spin!

40:34.890 --> 40:36.142
Gorgeous!

40:36.225 --> 40:38.686
-[Karamo] Flick them haters off.
-[Antoni] Yes!

40:38.769 --> 40:43.065
This is my version of, if you wanna be
in a suit, go in a more creative suit.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.442
-Yes, I'm living.
-[Jonathan] Yes!

40:44.525 --> 40:46.193
'Cause you're a musician, honey.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.864
This is not what he'll perform in tonight.
This is for, like, promotion.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.782
You're a genius. You're a genius.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.118
One of us in this room
has a show to prepare for.

40:54.201 --> 40:56.078
I do. Thank you.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.622
I will say,
a lot of the emotional barriers,

40:58.706 --> 41:01.542
a lot of the thought processes…
thank you, Karamo for that…

41:01.625 --> 41:02.460
You're welcome.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.712
…have started to not be so much
of a-- hmm--

41:04.795 --> 41:07.339
It's like a demon in my mind
or a monkey on my back, right?

41:07.423 --> 41:09.425
So, like,
that's kind of slowly going away,

41:09.508 --> 41:12.094
and the confidence and the dreaming big…

41:12.178 --> 41:13.554
Learning so much, like,

41:13.637 --> 41:16.432
the dressing, the clothes.
I need to look good to play good.

41:16.515 --> 41:17.349
Yeah.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.018
-Very proud of you.
-[Reggie] Thank you.

41:19.101 --> 41:21.187
I just can't wait
to see you on stage again.

41:21.270 --> 41:23.230

-[Reggie] Thank you so much.

45:27.975 --> 45:30.644
you realize it really wasn't
that big of a deal.

45:32.104 --> 45:36.483
Don't let your dreams fall by the wayside,
because you're in your own way.

[shouts] Oh, we love you, BlackLight!

46:08.390 --> 46:11.643
It's important to practice building
your self-esteem every day.

46:11.727 --> 46:13.228
So instead of looking in the mirror

46:13.312 --> 46:15.272
and saying things
I don't like about myself,

46:15.355 --> 46:17.107
point out the things that you do like.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.692
Like, "Ooh, I love my beard."

46:18.776 --> 46:20.110
"Ooh, I love my eyebrows."

46:20.194 --> 46:22.070
"Ooh, I know how to dance."

46:22.154 --> 46:25.574
And if you can't find the confidence
to say something good about yourself,

46:25.657 --> 46:27.951
get a buddy who can love you louder.

46:28.535 --> 46:32.664
Baby, you look amazing.
Look at that face. Look at that jawline.

46:32.748 --> 46:34.583
Now, you are gonna rock this day.

46:34.666 --> 46:36.126
Hey!

46:36.210 --> 46:38.796
Practice your self-esteem
every single day.
