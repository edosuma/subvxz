01:44.050 --> 01:47.970
>>Dead of winter,
cold as all hell.

01:49.230 --> 01:52.460
A man hails a cab, he slides in,

01:52.660 --> 01:55.030
sits in the warmth
in the back seat.

01:56.800 --> 02:01.510
A few miles down the road,
cab hits a sheet of black ice,

02:02.900 --> 02:05.090
starts spinning outta control,

02:05.290 --> 02:07.700
heading towards the
edge of the bridge,

02:07.900 --> 02:09.650
nothing but blackness below.

02:10.780 --> 02:14.300
Driver screams,
"We're all gonna die!"

02:16.770 --> 02:19.610
The man calmly leans
forward and softly says,

02:21.440 --> 02:23.840
"Could you turn the radio up?"

02:37.200 --> 02:40.080
>>I don't get it,
which one are you?

02:40.280 --> 02:41.810
The driver or the
guy in the back?

02:43.200 --> 02:44.340
>>Both.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.210
>>Hey, hey!

02:46.410 --> 02:47.430
Uh!

03:05.830 --> 03:08.230
>>We may all be sliding
towards the edge,

03:09.660 --> 03:12.270
but it's up to you how
comfortable you are doing it.

03:13.930 --> 03:15.810
Pay your debts, friend.

03:45.610 --> 03:46.480
>>Oh, hell.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.170
>>Hey.
>>How's it going?

05:40.370 --> 05:41.480
>>Good, yeah, getting there.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.960
>>Need you back on 32 tomorrow,

05:43.150 --> 05:44.870
once you get this buttoned up.

05:45.070 --> 05:45.910
>>Okay, yeah.

05:46.110 --> 05:46.960
>>Think you can handle

05:47.160 --> 05:48.690
two of Jim's shifts next week?

05:50.170 --> 05:51.660
>>Well, hell yeah.

05:51.860 --> 05:54.840
>>Good, 'cause he'll need
to take the week off,

05:55.040 --> 05:56.000
the kid died.

05:57.260 --> 05:58.050
>>What?

05:59.830 --> 06:01.800
Shit, Caleb?

06:02.000 --> 06:05.970
>>Well, he's gonna take
the week, funeral and all.

06:06.970 --> 06:08.010
>>Yeah, yeah.

06:10.020 --> 06:12.850
Damn, what the hell happened?

06:13.050 --> 06:16.420
>>Overdose, fucking
pills or whatever else.

06:16.620 --> 06:18.370
It's a shame too,
he was a good kid,

06:19.550 --> 06:21.860
he used to be, I don't know.

06:22.060 --> 06:25.520
>>Yeah.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.780
>>I gotta.

06:26.980 --> 06:27.830
>>Thanks, Mike.

06:28.030 --> 06:28.780
>>Yep.

07:23.990 --> 07:26.890
>>I still don't get why
it's gotta be so loud.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.750
>>Well, 'cause loud is fast.

07:31.010 --> 07:34.110
>>So how come you
race and Mama doesn't?

07:34.310 --> 07:37.840
>>Well, baby girl,
'cause your Mama's smart.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.810
>>And you're what?

07:41.010 --> 07:42.160
>>Well, I'm tough and strong.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.380
>>And Mama's not strong?

07:44.580 --> 07:45.810
>>Oh, geez, girl.

07:46.850 --> 07:48.910
Look, sometimes it's not about,

07:49.110 --> 07:51.910
you know, how much
you can lift, right,

07:52.110 --> 07:53.870
but about how much
weight you can carry,

07:54.070 --> 07:56.920
that makes you strong,
you know what that means?

07:57.110 --> 07:57.820
>>Maybe.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.090
>>You know those, ah,
those big, old trees

08:02.290 --> 08:04.750
we learned about out
there in California,

08:04.950 --> 08:06.790
ones so big you can drive
a car right through them?

08:06.990 --> 08:08.360
>>Yeah.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.490
>>You know how those trees
survived for thousands of years,

08:10.690 --> 08:12.020
right, just standing there

08:12.220 --> 08:14.590
and then one day, a
skinny, little man,

08:14.780 --> 08:16.890
your height, maybe even smaller
than you comes along, right,

08:17.090 --> 08:19.370
with a little ax, a few hours,

08:19.570 --> 08:21.370
he cuts that big, old tree down.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.720
>>She's a skinny man?

08:23.920 --> 08:28.080
>>No, baby girl, the ax,
right, she might be small,

08:28.280 --> 08:30.780
but damn, she can cut
that big old tree down.

08:30.970 --> 08:33.429
She doesn't need to race
to prove she's tough.

08:33.630 --> 08:36.429
She doesn't even need to
cut down a big, old tree,

08:36.630 --> 08:37.830
you know, like the ax, right?

08:38.030 --> 08:40.309
You can just take
one look at her,

08:40.510 --> 08:43.880
realize what she's capable
of, that's your Mama.

08:44.070 --> 08:45.750
>>Daddy says you're an ax.

08:45.950 --> 08:47.490
>>Hey.

08:47.690 --> 08:49.140
>>What, like an old battle ax?

08:49.340 --> 08:52.840
>>No, not an ax, I meant like a,

08:53.040 --> 08:55.100
a shiny, you know,
slender blade.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.370
>>Boy, I can cut
you down to size.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.850
>>Yeah, ain't that the truth?

08:59.050 --> 09:00.500
Get me in trouble.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.460
>>Trey's stopping by.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.810
>>Oh great, well, he
can slide under there

09:05.010 --> 09:07.550
and help me swap
that, that rear end.

09:07.750 --> 09:09.160
>>Oh well, good luck,

09:09.360 --> 09:11.560
that boy doesn't know a monkey
wrench from his asshole.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.820
>>Mama!

09:13.020 --> 09:14.080
>>Hey, come on,
help me with dinner.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.430
>>But I'm helping Dad.

09:15.630 --> 09:17.860
>>Come on, he can
clean up his own mess.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.910
Let's go.
>>Thanks for nothing.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.950
>>Damn, never miss
home cooked meals,

09:56.150 --> 09:57.600
until I get them.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.730
>>Doesn't beer count as home
cooked if you live at a bar?

09:59.930 --> 10:04.560
>>I live above
a bar, cut me some slack.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.910
No, seriously though,
that was delicious.

10:07.110 --> 10:09.790
Not as good as your
mom's, but pretty decent.

10:11.030 --> 10:11.870
Oh, shit, damn.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.620
You knew.

10:14.820 --> 10:16.140
>>Well, I didn't know
if you'd come otherwise.

10:16.340 --> 10:17.710
>>Well, I wouldn't have.
>>Oh yeah, I know.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.800
>>Oh, hey there, Uncle Bodie.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.790
>>Hey, Shelby, how's
my favorite driver?

10:25.880 --> 10:26.760
>>Good, good.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.230
>>What do you know, Trey?

10:30.710 --> 10:33.030
>>Just here for the
food, same as you.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.900
>>Oh, I'm guilty.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.550
You take care of that ticket?

10:37.750 --> 10:39.770
>>It's in the mail, Sheriff.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.460
>>Aren't they all?

10:42.720 --> 10:44.780
>>How you holding up, Sheriff?

10:44.980 --> 10:45.810
>>I'm still standing.

10:47.550 --> 10:48.830
>>Oh-oh!

10:49.030 --> 10:52.790
>>Oh, oh, no, no, no, my
heart, my heart is racing.

10:52.990 --> 10:57.660
Are you the most beautiful
princess in the world?

10:57.860 --> 11:00.310
>>Mr. Bodie, Mama
got you a plate.

11:01.570 --> 11:04.100
>>Plate? I ain't
here for no plate.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.630
I'm here on official
police business.

11:06.830 --> 11:08.540
>>Yeah, I bet, like every week.

11:08.740 --> 11:11.370
>>What? I am.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.850
>>Come on.

11:13.050 --> 11:14.680
>>Ah, you're too good
to me, thank you.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.160
>>We missed you
at service Sunday.

11:16.360 --> 11:21.150
>>Yeah, you know, I don't
know about that new preacher.

11:22.680 --> 11:25.470
Call me old fashioned,
but I'm kind of more of a,

11:25.670 --> 11:28.340
I don't know, fire and
brimstone type of guy, you know?

11:28.540 --> 11:30.690
>>Yeah, I hear that.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.440
>>Well, I hate to
grab a plate and run,

11:33.640 --> 11:36.260
but I think y'all don't
really watch me eat.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.310
>>Goodnight, Sheriff.

11:39.510 --> 11:41.750
>>Take care now.
>>You too.

11:41.950 --> 11:44.660
>>All right, little
lady, bedtime.

11:44.860 --> 11:45.670
>>Oh!

11:45.870 --> 11:46.490
>>No, no.

11:49.090 --> 11:50.190
>>Night, Daddy.

11:50.390 --> 11:51.720
>>Sweet dreams,
beauty, I love you.

11:51.910 --> 11:52.760
All right.
>>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:52.960 --> 11:54.720
Whoa, come on!
>>Night, booger.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.330
>>Goodnight, little booger.

11:56.530 --> 11:59.630
>>Come on.

12:07.770 --> 12:08.900
>>Hey, Earnhardt.

12:14.020 --> 12:14.820
>>Thank you.

12:16.950 --> 12:18.910
>>How long you
gonna do this for?

12:20.300 --> 12:22.430
>>I don't know, as
long as it takes.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.450
Fine anyway, these
are doing the trick.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.450
>>It killed Muhammad Ali,
this shit ain't no joke.

12:30.650 --> 12:32.360
>>And you think I
don't know that, Trey?

12:32.560 --> 12:34.620
What the hell you
want me to do, man?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.800
Let me just get our
heads above water,

12:38.000 --> 12:39.720
then we can deal
with me, all right?

12:39.920 --> 12:42.840
>>You can't get shit by her,
you know that, you never could.

12:44.540 --> 12:46.770
>>Think I like keeping
secrets from her, Trey?

12:46.970 --> 12:49.640
Just give me some
fucking room, huh?

12:49.840 --> 12:50.810
>>Your funeral.

12:54.410 --> 12:55.910
>>Come grab this side.

12:56.110 --> 12:59.040
>>Now? We just, we just ate.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.390
>>Now, fucker, let's go!

13:00.590 --> 13:02.260
>>All right, all
right, all right.

13:02.460 --> 13:03.130
Oh, man.

13:12.920 --> 13:17.920
♪ Blood on the highway

13:22.750 --> 13:25.630
♪ Gonna get my gun

13:32.760 --> 13:36.860
♪ War, it ain't over

13:37.060 --> 13:41.030
♪ Till all the killing's done

14:03.830 --> 14:04.670
>>Trey.

14:06.010 --> 14:07.810
What you doing here?

14:08.010 --> 14:10.030
>>Let's go for a ride.

14:10.230 --> 14:11.460
>>I don't know, man,

14:11.660 --> 14:12.810
Caroline's gonna be
home in a few minutes.

14:13.010 --> 14:14.900
>>Come on, I wanna
show you something.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.030
Now, I know you don't like
to be seen in an import,

14:17.230 --> 14:17.940
but get in.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.860
>>What's going on, Trey?

14:21.060 --> 14:25.000
>>Ain't nothing going on, just
take a fucking ride with me.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.820
30 minutes, I'll have you home.

14:28.430 --> 14:29.790
>>Yeah, all right, all right.

14:29.990 --> 14:32.050
If I wake up in Mexico
with no pants on,

14:32.250 --> 14:33.700
Caroline's gonna
cut your nuts off.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.100
>>Your pants
will stay on, I promise.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.100
>>They'd better.

14:37.300 --> 14:38.840
>>Unless you're feeling frisky.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.670
>>Hey, buy me an Oreo
shake and we'll talk.

14:41.870 --> 14:42.540
>>Done.

14:50.270 --> 14:51.980
>>Fucking seat belts
and everything, man,

14:52.180 --> 14:53.720
I can't believe
I'm in this thing.

14:53.920 --> 14:54.640
>>Fuck off.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.860
>>Been here, what, 20 years,

14:57.060 --> 14:59.290
still driving this
piece of shit?

14:59.490 --> 15:03.250
>>Tokyo Green, Hulk
here is unbeatable.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.870
>>Oh my God, Trey,
fucking embarrassing, man.

15:07.070 --> 15:10.510
I can't be seen in this
piece of shit, Christ.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.480
>>Whoo, listen to that purr.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.270
That's what I'm talking
about right there, bro.

15:16.470 --> 15:18.530
Whoo!

15:18.730 --> 15:20.580
>>Don't kill us Trey, Jesus.

15:23.730 --> 15:25.350
>>What, man, what is this?

15:27.010 --> 15:28.710
>>That.

15:28.910 --> 15:30.930
>>What you working
on your black belt?

15:33.010 --> 15:34.500
>>Nope.

15:34.700 --> 15:35.930
>>Okay, so what is it?

15:38.500 --> 15:39.460
>>100 K,

15:40.330 --> 15:42.680
cash at least.

15:43.940 --> 15:44.940
>>What is?

15:46.770 --> 15:48.860
>>What do you know about Oxy?

15:50.550 --> 15:53.830
>>I don't know shit about
Oxy, Trey, nothing, man,

15:54.030 --> 15:55.780
don't need to,
get me outta here.

15:55.980 --> 15:59.880
>>There's a doc in there,
some bullshit hack.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.620
People come in, "This
hurts and that hurts,"

16:02.820 --> 16:04.920
and Doc will write
out a script for them,

16:05.120 --> 16:07.350
hundreds of them every day.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.580
>>Okay, what the hell's
that got to do with me?

16:10.780 --> 16:13.800
>>And now these yokels, they
go and fulfill those scripts

16:14.000 --> 16:14.720
and guess what?

16:14.920 --> 16:16.490
They come right back here.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.420
Those pills go in and
out that back door

16:20.620 --> 16:22.860
and sold all over the county.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.470
>>Man, I don't fucking
care, right, take me home.

16:25.670 --> 16:27.380
>>And once they
sell those pills,

16:27.580 --> 16:29.730
they bring that cash
right back here,

16:29.930 --> 16:31.600
hundreds and
thousands of dollars

16:31.800 --> 16:34.520
running through this piece
of shit right here every week

16:34.720 --> 16:37.900
and nothing but a couple of
backwood inbreds running it.

16:40.170 --> 16:43.000
>>Trey, are you
fucking kidding me?

16:45.480 --> 16:46.620
>>Nope.

16:46.820 --> 16:48.140
>>Are you suggesting
that we stroll in there

16:48.340 --> 16:49.450
and we take that money?

16:49.650 --> 16:51.530
>>We can, we can.

16:53.960 --> 16:58.460
>>Man, that's a stupid
fucking idea.

16:58.660 --> 17:00.890
>>Never ever seen more
than one or two tweakers

17:01.090 --> 17:03.460
in there guarding that place.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.290
It ain't rocket science.

17:05.490 --> 17:07.410
>>Well, that's for damn sure.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.069
>>Shel, they're killing
people with this shit,

17:14.069 --> 17:15.079
you've seen it.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.339
>>I know.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.690
>>We all have,
this town is dying

17:18.890 --> 17:22.089
and these fuckers are
getting rich from it.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.700
That's your cash in
there, that's our cash,

17:25.900 --> 17:28.790
we put our blood, sweat
and tears into this town

17:28.990 --> 17:31.180
and they're just
taking it all from us.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.180
This whole place is
becoming a fucking cliche.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.710
First the factories fold,

17:40.580 --> 17:43.020
then no jobs, no hope

17:43.220 --> 17:45.290
and then these
leeches, they come in,

17:45.490 --> 17:47.240
they suck what's
left off the bottom.

17:50.050 --> 17:54.940
I'm sick of it, Shel,
I'm sick of it.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.900
And I don't wanna see Mila
left in the mud either.

18:33.970 --> 18:36.380
Hey, this is easy money, Shel.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.720
>>Don't talk to me about
this shit again, you hear?

19:44.830 --> 19:46.750
Don't tell me someone else died,

19:46.950 --> 19:48.630
I can't handle that
shit right now.

19:48.830 --> 19:51.050
>>Hop in, catch some of this AC.

19:59.710 --> 20:01.250
>>What's going on?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.410
>>Jim needs those shifts back.

20:05.810 --> 20:07.820
>>Damn, okay.

20:08.020 --> 20:09.900
>>I'll pay for the funeral.

20:11.290 --> 20:12.650
>>Yeah, I get it.

20:15.030 --> 20:16.690
>>Oh, shit, that ain't all, man.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.180
>>Shit, Mike.

20:25.210 --> 20:27.870
>>Well, hey there, Shelby.

20:28.740 --> 20:30.930
How we doing today, sugar?

20:31.130 --> 20:33.800
>>I'm hanging in, Ms.
Whitney, what about yourself?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.200
>>Well, I'm still
upright, praise Jesus.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.940
>>Yes, ma'am, I hear that.

20:39.140 --> 20:42.800
>>Early
this month, huh?

20:44.240 --> 20:44.980
>>Yeah.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.730
>>Oh, damn it, I'm so sorry.

20:48.930 --> 20:51.250
>>I appreciate
that, Ms. Whitney.

20:51.450 --> 20:52.770
You know what?
>>Hm?

20:54.860 --> 20:56.910
>>Might as well have that too.

20:57.110 --> 20:57.960
>>All righty.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.340
You want your balance receipt?

21:01.560 --> 21:04.140
>>Oh, hell, couldn't
pay for the ink anyway.

21:04.340 --> 21:05.090
>>Love to the girls.

21:05.290 --> 21:07.400
>>Appreciate that, Ms. Whitney.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.390
Take care.
>>Bye.

21:39.950 --> 21:42.170
>>I don't know, man,

21:42.370 --> 21:43.960
guns and drugs,

21:44.160 --> 21:46.130
that shit ain't me.

21:47.820 --> 21:49.040
>>No, it ain't.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.620
That's why you leave
that shit to me.

21:53.820 --> 21:56.320
You just drive the
car and watch my back,

21:56.520 --> 21:59.970
you don't even need to
touch a gun, I promise.

22:01.580 --> 22:02.850
Look, I know these dudes,

22:03.050 --> 22:04.330
we're not talking
"Goodfellas" here,

22:04.530 --> 22:07.360
we're talking a couple slack
jaws with pill problems.

22:19.450 --> 22:21.730
>>Girls are going to
Tupelo this weekend.

22:24.950 --> 22:26.250
>>Looky there.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.810
>>Wish you were coming.

23:36.010 --> 23:38.990
>>Shit, no, you don't.

23:39.190 --> 23:41.730
You love that big, old
guest bed all to yourself.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.160
Stay up late watching those
God awful dating shows.

23:46.460 --> 23:48.030
>>You gonna be good here?

23:49.470 --> 23:51.090
>>Of course.

23:51.290 --> 23:54.610
>>Well, good, 'cause I do
love that bed.

23:54.810 --> 23:56.920
Hey, you know what, why don't
you take a couple hundred

23:57.120 --> 23:58.700
and get that old
bluff from Kenny?

23:58.900 --> 24:00.660
You know, keep going
a few more weekends,

24:00.860 --> 24:03.000
I mean, you said Mike
gave you those shifts.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.140
>>Oh baby, I told you,

24:07.400 --> 24:10.440
I can't fix it with what
we got, stays broke.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.110
>>Damn, I love you.

24:14.310 --> 24:16.590
>>What are y'all talking about?

24:16.790 --> 24:17.940
>>Little girls not
finishing packing

24:18.140 --> 24:19.810
and getting left behind.
>>You have three minutes

24:20.010 --> 24:21.590
or this train's leaving
with or without you.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.420
>>I just need someone to
sit on it while I zip.

24:23.620 --> 24:25.080
>>Okay, I'll be up
in a few minutes.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.560
>>Well, I'm leaving in three.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.560
>>Oh, boy, she is
definitely your daughter.

24:34.110 --> 24:34.690
>>Open it.

24:34.890 --> 24:35.870
>>What the hell's this?

24:36.070 --> 24:36.770
>>Open it.

24:49.180 --> 24:50.620
>>Damn,

24:50.820 --> 24:52.220
you are too much.

24:55.580 --> 24:56.970
>>Mom.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.720
>>Daughter's calling you.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.810
>>Hm, hm-hm, she's
definitely yours.

25:28.030 --> 25:29.490
>>Yeah, this will do.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.090
Where'd you find it?

25:33.090 --> 25:34.830
>>Don't you worry about that.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.670
>>Jesus Christ, Trey.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.190
>>Color's ugly as shit,

25:39.390 --> 25:41.980
but it's a turbo just
like you asked for.

25:42.180 --> 25:44.810
>>Yeah, what about the plates?

25:45.010 --> 25:46.100
>>I took care of it.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.510
>>I do love a turbo V6.

25:54.760 --> 25:58.300
>>Look at Shelby Conners all
excited about a stolen vehicle.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.780
You little criminal.
>>Hey!

26:00.980 --> 26:03.260
This isn't New York, all right,

26:03.460 --> 26:05.790
this is my own backyard, man.

26:05.990 --> 26:08.790
Act like you understand
we're breaking the law.

26:08.990 --> 26:11.090
Act like you understand
what's at stake here.

26:13.610 --> 26:18.140
>>Hey, she's my niece, I fucking
understand what's at stake.

26:21.010 --> 26:23.190
I'm not the one we
gotta worry about.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.240
>>Let's just get this over with.

26:40.330 --> 26:41.640
>>Mr. Bodie.

26:44.550 --> 26:45.690
>>That ain't good.

26:46.950 --> 26:49.130
>>I'll get with the
oncologist in Birmingham,

26:49.330 --> 26:53.400
but in the meantime, you
go home, enjoy your day.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.140
We'll take this
one step at a time.

26:58.340 --> 26:59.320
>>Man.

27:41.910 --> 27:46.630
♪ Oh

27:46.830 --> 27:51.630
♪ Oh oh

27:51.830 --> 27:56.710
♪ Oh oh

27:57.280 --> 27:59.190
♪ Oh oh oh oh

28:00.760 --> 28:04.380
>>When we get in there, you
just watch my back, that's it.

28:04.580 --> 28:06.780
Okay, we'll be fine as
long as you watch my back.

28:06.980 --> 28:08.430
Here.

28:08.630 --> 28:09.340
>>What the fuck is this, Trey?

28:09.540 --> 28:10.390
You said I wouldn't need this.

28:10.590 --> 28:11.300
>>Just hold the fucking thing

28:11.500 --> 28:12.430
and look like you might use it.

28:12.630 --> 28:13.910
What the fuck, all right?

28:14.110 --> 28:15.610
You won't even need
to lift it, trust me.

28:15.810 --> 28:17.050
>>Fuck, fuck, fuck, man, fuck!

28:17.250 --> 28:19.090
>>Hey, hey, hey, hey,
we got this, okay?

28:19.290 --> 28:21.230
We got this.

28:23.250 --> 28:24.970
>>Jesus Christ,
Trey, fuck's sake.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.930
>>What, does it clash
with your outfit? Come on.

28:28.130 --> 28:30.280
>>I don't know,
man, I don't know.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.880
>>Hey, just do what family does.

28:34.190 --> 28:37.370
We're family, bro, we
look out for each other.

28:37.570 --> 28:38.460
>>Okay.

28:38.660 --> 28:40.030
>>All right?
>>Okay.

28:40.230 --> 28:40.810
Fuck.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.020
>>Right, come on.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.030
>>Fuck.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.730
>>Hey, take this.

28:48.930 --> 28:50.650
Come on, let's go.

28:50.850 --> 28:52.740
Come on, get out of the
fucking car, let's go.

29:32.590 --> 29:33.380
>>Ssh!

29:40.110 --> 29:41.390
>>Hey!

29:41.590 --> 29:42.740
Shit, Trey, what the fuck?

29:48.380 --> 29:50.270
>>Over there.

30:01.310 --> 30:02.760
>>That might've
been an accident,

30:02.960 --> 30:04.980
but the next one
won't be, you hear me?

30:05.180 --> 30:06.970
This guy moves,
take his head off.

30:08.190 --> 30:09.330
Come on.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.300
>>Y'all know whose
money this is,

30:17.500 --> 30:19.780
you have any fucking
idea whose money this is?

30:19.980 --> 30:21.290
>>Shut the fuck up, shut up!

30:24.030 --> 30:25.080
>>Are you okay?

30:29.170 --> 30:32.000
>>Don't look at me,
don't fucking look at me.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.930
>>Ah, shit, tough guy,
y'all don't wanna do this,

30:36.120 --> 30:37.670
you don't wanna do it.

30:37.870 --> 30:40.060
>>Hurry the fuck up, come on.

30:40.260 --> 30:44.370
>>Hey, hey, are you
a Bronson fan, huh?

30:44.570 --> 30:45.760
>>Come on, hurry up, let's go.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.280
>>What's your favorite
"Death Wish" movie,

30:47.480 --> 30:48.810
"One, two, three?"

30:49.010 --> 30:50.850
My friend on the floor
was a Bronson fan,

30:51.050 --> 30:52.380
why don't you ask him, huh?

30:52.580 --> 30:53.640
>>Shut the fuck up, okay.
>>You wanna know

30:53.840 --> 30:54.810
what my favorite is?
>>Turn around!

30:55.010 --> 30:56.470
>>The one where I
hunt you all down,

30:56.670 --> 30:59.300
snatch the life out of you,
cut the heads off all your kin

30:59.500 --> 31:01.550
and shoot your fucking dog!

31:02.940 --> 31:04.820
It ain't your all's world, huh,

31:05.020 --> 31:05.870
but you're gonna
fucking die in it.

31:06.070 --> 31:07.220
>>Shut the fuck up.

31:07.420 --> 31:08.830
>>Come on!

31:09.030 --> 31:11.660
>>Your voice sounds familiar.

31:11.860 --> 31:13.880
Yeah, yeah, look at me, huh?

31:14.080 --> 31:16.880
Yeah, I know you,
yeah, I seen you, boy.

31:17.080 --> 31:18.320
You all are gonna fucking die.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.750
>>Come on, let's go, let's go!

31:19.950 --> 31:21.800
>>You should listen
to your partner here.

31:22.000 --> 31:22.670
>>No!

31:23.910 --> 31:24.800
>>Oh, shit!

31:25.000 --> 31:26.710
>>Let's go, let's go!

31:33.440 --> 31:36.860
>>Oh, shit, shit, shit.

31:38.840 --> 31:43.770
Fuck!

31:44.590 --> 31:45.600
You fucking shot that guy,

31:45.800 --> 31:47.300
what the fuck is wrong with you?

31:47.500 --> 31:49.690
Huh? Shit!

31:49.890 --> 31:51.170
Who is it, Trey?

31:52.300 --> 31:53.920
Shit, ah!

31:55.420 --> 31:57.790
>>Just some heavies, man!

32:14.180 --> 32:17.100
>>Sheriff Bodie, you read me?

32:18.450 --> 32:19.590
>>Go ahead, Beth.

32:19.790 --> 32:22.730
>>Reports of shots
fired, 1911 Bass Lane.

32:22.930 --> 32:23.980
>>Oh, shit.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.090
>>They're getting
fucking close, Trey!

32:37.550 --> 32:40.220
>>Wait a minute, stop!

32:40.420 --> 32:42.830
>>What the fuck you doing?

32:43.030 --> 32:45.450
Trey, get back in
the fucking car!

32:45.650 --> 32:47.320
They're shooting at us, shit!

32:51.960 --> 32:53.280
Shit, shit, shit, fuck!

32:53.480 --> 32:54.930
Fuck!

34:21.270 --> 34:22.139
>>Hands up!

34:24.489 --> 34:25.889
Up, come on!

34:26.090 --> 34:27.929
Get your hands up!

34:30.449 --> 34:32.670
Come on now, get them up.

34:59.830 --> 35:00.570
>>Yes!

35:01.700 --> 35:04.240
Look at this.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.850
We did it!

35:07.270 --> 35:08.500
Uh!

35:09.790 --> 35:11.770
>>Fucker!
>>Stop, stop, no, no!

35:12.970 --> 35:14.980
>>What the fuck was that?

35:15.890 --> 35:17.470
>>We got the money.

35:17.670 --> 35:21.040
>>The fucking money? We
killed two people, Trey!

35:21.240 --> 35:22.780
You shot him!

35:22.980 --> 35:25.170
What was that shit, huh?

35:25.370 --> 35:29.310
>>Those weren't people,
those were drug dealers,

35:29.500 --> 35:32.210
scum, pill pushers, fuck them.

35:34.870 --> 35:36.920
>>Man, who the fuck are you?

35:37.120 --> 35:37.920
>>We got the cash.

35:38.120 --> 35:39.580
>>Fuck the cash!

35:39.780 --> 35:41.930
What was that shit
with the pills?

35:42.130 --> 35:43.100
Huh?

35:43.300 --> 35:46.280
We didn't go there for that!

35:46.480 --> 35:48.530
You fucking motherfucker.

35:49.710 --> 35:51.630
I didn't fucking sign
up for this shit.

35:51.830 --> 35:55.370
>>Yes, you did, yes, you did!

35:55.570 --> 35:58.160
Yeah, we got the money,
God knows how much

35:58.360 --> 36:00.500
and yeah, we got a
shit load of pills too.

36:01.850 --> 36:04.200
I'm sorry, you thought you
were gonna be halfway in.

36:09.510 --> 36:12.570
>>He said he knew you, Trey.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.910
Did he, do you know those guys?

36:16.300 --> 36:18.040
>>It doesn't matter now.

36:22.650 --> 36:25.840
We just need to to lay
low for a little bit,

36:26.040 --> 36:28.930
keep our heads down, all right.

36:29.130 --> 36:30.440
>>Oh, you're taking it?

36:32.790 --> 36:37.590
>>You want it? Here, take
it, go on, it's yours.

36:37.790 --> 36:39.190
It's called trust, bro.

36:41.190 --> 36:43.810
Just keep it safe, hide it
your toolbox or something,

36:44.010 --> 36:45.720
keep it away from the girls.

36:59.210 --> 37:00.950
>>We fucking killed them, Trey.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.040
>>Yeah, we did, we killed them.

37:07.090 --> 37:09.710
The way I see it,
it was us or them

37:09.910 --> 37:12.360
and I'd fucking do
it again if I had to.

37:16.360 --> 37:19.630
We're family, bro,
that shit back there,

37:19.830 --> 37:21.840
that was nothing but
taking care of family.

37:25.890 --> 37:27.210
Come on.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.020
Come here, come here.

37:38.820 --> 37:40.910
Let's go home.

38:03.930 --> 38:07.850
>>We got a 9-0-4 on
Old Fence Road off 58.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.200
We got two dead in the BOLO,

38:11.410 --> 38:13.770
red Buick Regal and I
do not have the tags.

38:13.970 --> 38:17.910
>>10-4, Bodie, Dispatch
will find the new location.

38:18.110 --> 38:19.810
>>Let it burn.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.720
>>Hey, baby, what you doing?

38:49.920 --> 38:51.290
>>Going to bed?

38:51.490 --> 38:54.860
>>Yeah, well, I miss
you, you look beautiful.

38:55.060 --> 38:55.640
>>I know.

38:57.450 --> 38:59.860
>>All righty, you, get
in there, I'll be inside.

39:00.060 --> 39:01.430
>>Sweet dreams.

39:01.630 --> 39:02.690
>>Come on.
>>Love you.

39:02.890 --> 39:03.550
>>Night.

39:05.470 --> 39:06.910
>>What are you up to?

39:07.110 --> 39:08.310
>>Just out here in my office.

39:08.510 --> 39:09.950
>>Are you sleeping?

39:11.430 --> 39:12.880
>>Not without you.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.490
>>Baby, you already have me,

39:15.690 --> 39:17.840
no need to keep up
with that sweet talk.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.620
>>No, I know you like it though.

39:20.820 --> 39:21.970
>>I do.

39:23.780 --> 39:24.880
>>How you doing?

39:25.840 --> 39:27.890
>>Today was a good day.

39:28.090 --> 39:29.930
It's good to be out here.

39:31.060 --> 39:32.630
I wish you were here though.

39:50.990 --> 39:52.390
>>Just you?

39:53.860 --> 39:56.830
>>Just me, you doing
all right there?

39:57.030 --> 40:00.400
>>Oh, hell yeah, been a
while since I had a dust up,

40:00.600 --> 40:01.830
but I'm fine.

40:03.180 --> 40:06.360
>>In there ain't, county's
sending the coroner down

40:06.560 --> 40:07.970
for what's left.

40:09.970 --> 40:11.800
>>Ben, what are those?

40:12.000 --> 40:12.800
>>Oh,.

40:14.970 --> 40:17.460
I'd just gotten my boots
off when I got the call.

40:17.660 --> 40:21.890
>>Man, we're like the
Goddamn Boy Scouts out here.

40:23.150 --> 40:26.860
All right, let's,
let's go in, cameras?

40:27.060 --> 40:28.990
>>Sure, but the
drives were taken.

40:30.160 --> 40:31.910
Car wash has one though.

40:32.110 --> 40:33.350
>>Well, let's get them.

40:33.550 --> 40:35.480
>>I already got
them on my laptop.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.260
>>I bet you do.

40:37.460 --> 40:39.050
>>Two men in and out,

40:39.250 --> 40:40.960
off in a hurry.

40:44.790 --> 40:48.410
>>Oh.

40:48.610 --> 40:49.920
Well, let's see.

40:53.090 --> 40:53.750
Hell.

41:14.210 --> 41:15.910
>>What you thinking?

41:16.110 --> 41:19.220
>>I'm thinking
that he's a poor bastard,

41:19.420 --> 41:23.490
that's what I'm thinking,
now were there any witnesses?

41:23.680 --> 41:26.000
>>Sure, Ms. Whitney.

41:27.130 --> 41:28.270
>>What?

41:28.470 --> 41:31.140
>>Yep, she moonlit
over here and the doc,

41:31.340 --> 41:33.670
but he ain't talking yet.

41:33.870 --> 41:36.320
>>All right, well, well,

41:36.520 --> 41:38.930
we just wait for Ms.
Whitney's story, I guess.

41:40.360 --> 41:43.460
But I tell you what
it's gonna be about,

41:43.660 --> 41:47.760
it's gonna be about pills
and money and cussing.

41:49.110 --> 41:51.980
>>Two men, shotgun and a pistol.

41:54.860 --> 41:58.350
>>Yeah, well, the
pistol did that

41:58.550 --> 42:01.470
and the wood furniture
done that guy in.

42:02.560 --> 42:03.820
>>And he ain't here.

42:05.130 --> 42:06.390
>>No, he isn't.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.480
Whiskey in them cups.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.150
And that arm is
junkies robbing junkies

42:17.350 --> 42:19.270
just like the two
guys from the highway.

42:20.750 --> 42:23.800
Man, this is as
crooked as the Chattahoochee.

42:29.020 --> 42:31.200
Well, all right,

42:31.400 --> 42:34.470
call me if anything turns up.

42:34.670 --> 42:35.910
Oh.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.520
>>That's it?

42:37.720 --> 42:40.990
>>That's it, we gotta wait
for, for Ms. Whitney's story

42:41.900 --> 42:44.260
and state's gonna wanna
be in on this one.

42:44.460 --> 42:46.830
>>Sure you don't wanna
look at that tape?

42:52.480 --> 42:53.870
>>Come on, let's go look at it.

43:02.790 --> 43:06.100
>>Wheel man can
drive, that's a fact.

43:07.670 --> 43:08.450
>>Mm-hm.

43:10.410 --> 43:13.600
All right, well,
I'm going to sleep.

43:13.790 --> 43:16.330
Call me if you need
me, otherwise, don't.

43:19.020 --> 43:20.850
>>You sure you're all right?

43:22.290 --> 43:25.770
>>Ben, find your Goddamn boots.

43:50.350 --> 43:53.030
>>God's servant for your good.

43:59.540 --> 44:04.460
First is the servant
of God.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.440
That hit the spot.

next question, okay?

44:33.060 --> 44:35.760
What did you wanna
be when you grew up?

44:37.840 --> 44:41.900
>>I don't know, I guess
I always told my mom

44:42.100 --> 44:44.900
I wanted to work with horses.

49:50.190 --> 49:52.990
>>You see the statement from
the doc and Ms. Whitney?

49:56.500 --> 49:57.820
>>Is that it on your seat?

49:58.900 --> 50:00.340
Then how did I see it?

50:01.950 --> 50:05.090
>>Well, the doc wants immunity.

50:05.290 --> 50:07.360
>>Is that right?
>>Yeah.

50:07.560 --> 50:10.660
He says this thing they got
into goes all the way down

50:10.860 --> 50:13.050
to a New Orleans
outfit, down that way.

50:14.920 --> 50:18.410
Pills, clinics, girls, money,

50:18.610 --> 50:21.020
he's saying it's a
damn empire, Bodie.

50:21.220 --> 50:24.760
You know what they're
saying? This outfit is mob.

50:24.960 --> 50:27.810
>>Will you stop it
acting like a preteen

50:28.010 --> 50:30.420
at a Beatles concert,
for God's sake?

50:30.620 --> 50:32.770
What does the state
say, they want in?

50:32.970 --> 50:33.770
>>Nope.
>>They don't want in?

50:33.970 --> 50:34.770
>>Nope.

50:34.970 --> 50:35.910
>>Why not?

50:36.110 --> 50:38.000
>>State line thing,
they're saying DEA,

50:38.200 --> 50:40.040
can you believe that, DEA here?

50:40.240 --> 50:42.130
>>What Ms. Whitney say?

50:42.330 --> 50:44.740
>>Not much, don't
ask, don't tell.

50:44.940 --> 50:46.430
Paid her cash though.

50:47.430 --> 50:48.170
>>Hm.

50:50.480 --> 50:53.360
Lordy, it's just Sunday, damn.

50:53.560 --> 50:55.010
>>That ain't all.

50:55.210 --> 50:56.970
>>You found the shotgun vic?

50:57.170 --> 50:59.450
>>Yeah, well, a
neighbor found him.

50:59.650 --> 51:00.670
>>You got him?

51:00.870 --> 51:02.020
>>He's dead.

51:02.220 --> 51:03.850
>>Well, how, did he bleed out?

51:04.050 --> 51:05.460
>>Oh yeah.
>>Pills?

51:05.660 --> 51:09.810
>>Pills and blood, for sure,
but that ain't what did him in,

51:10.010 --> 51:11.980
a lamp cord around
his neck killed him.

51:12.930 --> 51:13.940
>>Hm.

51:14.140 --> 51:15.420
Shit.

51:15.620 --> 51:19.980
>>Shit? Someone's
cleaning up, Bodie, mob.

51:23.900 --> 51:27.130
>>Well, at least you got
the right shoes on today.

51:30.290 --> 51:32.310
>>Hey, Bodie, do
you think the DEA

51:32.510 --> 51:34.700
will give me one
of those jackets?

51:36.090 --> 51:38.320
>>Well, slap you to sleep
and slap you for sleeping.

51:38.520 --> 51:40.190
Now get outta here.

52:10.820 --> 52:12.300
>>Morning, Shelby.

52:15.260 --> 52:16.080
Get up.

52:21.920 --> 52:24.280
>>Hey, listen, I won't talk.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.890
Uh!

52:30.220 --> 52:31.110
>>Get down.

52:32.830 --> 52:34.190
Give me your hands.

52:49.380 --> 52:50.950
>>I don't fucking know you.

52:51.950 --> 52:52.820
>>No, sir.

52:54.730 --> 52:56.390
>>So what do you want?

52:57.950 --> 52:59.700
>>Well, I heard y'all
thought it was a good idea

52:59.900 --> 53:03.660
to steal from the Nola
folk, said y'all thought

53:03.860 --> 53:06.140
we were all a bunch
of stupid cunts,

53:06.340 --> 53:09.090
wouldn't do shit
about it, that true?

53:10.310 --> 53:13.660
>>I don't know what
that means, none of it.

53:17.010 --> 53:19.030
But if something
was stolen from you

53:19.230 --> 53:22.730
and that something's
been returned,

53:22.920 --> 53:25.770
I don't see why we can't
forget the whole thing,

53:25.970 --> 53:28.080
just go on about our lives,

53:28.280 --> 53:30.900
over here, wherever
you come from.

53:35.420 --> 53:36.700
No, no, no, no, no, no!

53:36.900 --> 53:38.610
Hey, hey, please, look,

53:38.810 --> 53:40.740
hey, look, this can
be worked out, okay.

53:40.940 --> 53:42.750
All right, whatever
happened, all right,

53:42.940 --> 53:44.180
wrongs can be righted.

53:44.380 --> 53:45.360
>>Well, that's why I'm here.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.710
>>Okay, well,
let's do that then,

53:47.910 --> 53:49.060
okay, let's just talk about it.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.890
Hey, you got what you
came here for, huh?

53:53.090 --> 53:54.100
>>Almost.

53:57.570 --> 53:58.270
>>No, no!

53:59.360 --> 54:01.490
No, fucking no, Trey, no!

54:02.360 --> 54:03.280
Fucking stop, fuck!

54:38.910 --> 54:42.270
>>2292 Kent Street,
Tupelo, Mississippi.

54:45.360 --> 54:47.720
Yeah, he gave that up too.

54:47.920 --> 54:50.290
>>They got nothing
to do with this.

54:50.490 --> 54:51.810
>>They do now.

54:53.460 --> 54:58.460
You try to leave
town, cops, whatever,

54:59.900 --> 55:03.990
my man in Tupelo gets
rambunctious, you understand me?

55:16.300 --> 55:17.310
I'll be in touch.

55:26.360 --> 55:29.150
Is that a tulip
tree or a dogwood?

55:30.190 --> 55:31.850
Huh?

57:50.160 --> 57:52.390
>>Morning, Shel.

57:52.590 --> 57:53.650
>>Hi, Uncle Bodie.

57:53.850 --> 57:55.950
What you doing out
around these parts?

57:57.080 --> 57:58.780
>>Hell you been, boy?

57:58.980 --> 58:03.910
>>Oh, I got a couple of hog
traps out at the end of 5-79,

58:05.130 --> 58:06.700
weir been rising
a little, I guess,

58:06.900 --> 58:08.270
they've all been underwater now,

58:08.470 --> 58:10.750
just had to move
them a little higher.

58:10.950 --> 58:13.620
>>Well, better you than me,
I'd just as soon shoot them.

58:14.830 --> 58:16.410
Anyway, I'm here
looking for Trey.

58:16.610 --> 58:17.630
>>Hm, yeah?

58:17.830 --> 58:18.980
>>Yeah, you seen
him, heard from him?

58:19.180 --> 58:22.110
>>No, no, not in a
couple of days, I guess.

58:22.310 --> 58:24.200
You know, Caroline's
back with her folks,

58:24.400 --> 58:26.330
so he, ah, he
hasn't been around.

58:26.530 --> 58:28.810
>>Okay.
>>Why, what's going on?

58:29.010 --> 58:32.470
>>Oh, probably nothing, I
got a call early this morning

58:32.670 --> 58:33.730
from the High Bar,

58:33.930 --> 58:36.300
they were complaining
about noise and whatnot

58:36.500 --> 58:38.870
and I gotta check it out,

58:39.070 --> 58:40.390
'cause if a bar is complaining

58:40.590 --> 58:44.220
about noise from an apartment
upstairs,

58:44.420 --> 58:49.350
But as I said, it's probably
nothing, you know Trey.

58:49.870 --> 58:50.840
>>Yeah, I do.

58:51.040 --> 58:51.960
>>Yeah.

58:54.920 --> 58:56.620
So what happened here?

59:01.130 --> 59:02.840
>>Just locked myself out.

59:03.970 --> 59:05.010
>>Hm,

59:06.020 --> 59:09.020
and when you broke the
glass, it went this way?

59:13.760 --> 59:15.560
>>Caroline took
Mila to her folks

59:15.760 --> 59:16.770
up in Tupelo for a few days,

59:16.970 --> 59:20.330
we, ah, we got into
it the other night,

59:21.810 --> 59:23.740
threw a damn beer through
the window.

59:23.940 --> 59:25.770
That's why she left, you know,

59:27.120 --> 59:30.000
it's all just getting to us,
you know, just everything.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.700
>>Yeah, I do know, I was
married for 38 years,

59:33.900 --> 59:37.840
but I'd get this cleaned
up before Mila comes back,

59:38.040 --> 59:42.970
those little feet, oh, you
know, that's my princess.

59:43.840 --> 59:44.890
>>Yes, sir, will do.

59:45.090 --> 59:47.360
>>All right, let me
know if Trey turns up

59:48.230 --> 59:50.030
and good luck tonight.

59:50.220 --> 59:51.550
>>Thank you.

59:51.750 --> 59:55.800
>>Oh, does Trey still
drive that, that Jap thing?

59:56.890 --> 59:58.600
>>Yes, sir, he does,

59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.160
can't get him to go
American quite just yet.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.730
>>All right, take care.

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:06.300
>>Yeah, you too.
>>All right.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:29.930
>>Pack of Camels.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.980
>>Ah, there you go.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.110
That's eight even.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:38.850
Thank you.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:41.330
There you go.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.170
>>Say, what do y'all
do in this town?

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:46.990
>>Pardon me?

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.780
>>Oh, no disrespect, old timer,

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:53.610
but what do people do here?

01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:54.920
>>Like for fun?

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.920
>>People have fun here?

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.830
>>Well, sure, I mean,

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.440
we got the track
on Monday nights

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:06.140
and hunting and football
in the fall, I guess.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:10.800
>>So between shooting squirrels
and high school football,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.880
people just kind of meander
around waiting to die?

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.680
>>I, I guess.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.380
No, that, that ain't right.

01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:21.990
>>You grow up around here?

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:23.680
>>About a mile that a way.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.380
>>When you were growing up,

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.080
you always wanted to run
the local gas station?

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.810
>>Oh, you know,

01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:35.830
my daddy ran the station
down there on old 24,

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:38.260
I guess I just followed suit.

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:40.140
>>Here you are, huh?

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:42.090
>>Yes, sir, here I am.

01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:43.570
>>You got kids?

01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:46.880
>>Got a son, he grown though.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.530
>>I see, what's he do?

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:53.580
>>You ask
a lot of questions.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.450
>>I'm intrigued.

01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:57.670
Y'all intrigue me.

01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:58.930
>>All right.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.850
Well, come back.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:08.860

hits the highway,

like you're gonna pass him.

two clicks north of 24.

We should get another car.

01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:44.580
>>No, I'm done, I
did what you said.

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.180
>>We ain't done yet, under 50.

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:51.630
>>Look, if you just
let them go, all right,

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:53.760
I'll do whatever
the fuck you want.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:55.240

hell's wrong with you?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.670
>>I do apologize,
but it is urgent.

01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:36.760
Now I have reason to believe
that your life is in danger,

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.810
so what I want you to do is
just pack a couple of things

01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:41.020
and come with me.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.990

and the hell I am.

01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:45.600

>>I don't care

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.780
about what happened
down at that clinic,

01:13:47.970 --> 01:13:49.690
I'm staying the hell out of it.

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:53.040
>>Okay, you win, now would
it be all right with you

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.350
and with your permission,
if I just had my deputy

01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:57.740
stay outside parked there?

01:13:57.940 --> 01:13:59.740
>>As long as he's
off my property,

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:01.700
I don't give a rat's
ass what he does.

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:03.750
>>I understand, I
do, thank you, thank-

01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:07.320
Lord have mercy.

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:05.290
>>Well, isn't this a pickle?

01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:09.280
>>A pickle?

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:13.200
>>What the hell
you want me to do?

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.680
>>I'm getting the feeling
you're angry at me,

01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:20.780
angry as if you didn't
take it upon yourself

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:24.260
to rob some very wealthy and
powerful people at gunpoint

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:28.270
and didn't get away with it,
as if what's happening now

01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:31.750
wasn't a direct result
of your own actions,

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:33.740
that's the feeling I'm getting.

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:38.450
>>I didn't ask for this shit.

01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:39.880
>>Yeah, you did.

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.780
>>Sheriff's Department.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.440
>>Yeah, hi, um,

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.750
you're gonna have to head
over to the station off 46,

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:14.920
because there's a body
in the trunk of a car

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.530
and make it quick.

01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:50.170
>>Uh!

01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:54.690
>>Come on.

01:16:57.390 --> 01:16:58.490
>>No.

01:16:58.690 --> 01:16:59.390
>>Yes.

01:17:06.570 --> 01:17:07.970
>>Shit.

01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:10.660
Oh, God, is she dead?

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:13.280
>>Not yet.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:16.540
>>What the fuck,
man, what the fuck?

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.940
>>Go on.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.600
>>No.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.160
No, fuck you, get the
fuck away from me.

01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:33.780
>>Shelby, I don't kill innocent
people, I told you that.

01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:36.700
>>Well, I'm sure as
shit not gonna do it.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:39.610
>>Well, I'm gonna show
you something right now.

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:43.220
I have to give you a
warning before I do,

01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:47.010
it's gonna be very unpleasant.

01:17:57.620 --> 01:18:01.120
Uh!

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:02.810
>>I'll kill you.

01:18:03.010 --> 01:18:06.080
I swear to God I'll
kill you, I'll do it.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.250
>>Okay.

01:18:16.690 --> 01:18:17.690
Get it done.

01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:42.560
We gotta go.

01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:46.570
Hey.

01:19:46.770 --> 01:19:47.910
We gotta get now.

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.720
Go, go.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.620
Go.

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:30.180
>>Come on, come on!

01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.080
Oh, shit!

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.500
Where the hell you been?

01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.540
>>That ain't fair, Bodie.

01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.030
We all got that call.

01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:04.120
>>You made the wrong one.

01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:06.420
She is dead.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.880
>>I wanna kill you.

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:06.700
>>I know.

01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.270
Your family's on the way.

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.020
>>What, here?

01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:17.710
>>Not here, but
close, they're safe.

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:26.850
>>Oh, shit.

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:41.170
>>Stay cool, Shel.

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:53.880
>>Hey, Sheriff.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:56.660
>>Shelby.

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:11.160
I don't believe I know you.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:16.290
>>This here's my new sponsor
over from New Orleans.

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:19.290
>>Fred Ellsworth,
Ellsworth Construction.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:21.910
>>Nola, huh?

01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:23.440
>>Most of the time,

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:26.140
I'm opening up a small
shop down these parts

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:29.310
and recognize the power
of local marketing

01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:31.840
through this here young talent.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:32.970
>>Tax trip, huh?

01:23:33.170 --> 01:23:34.880
>>Hm.
>>Hm

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.960
What you got there going on?

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.670
>>Oh,

01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:42.330
yeah, I nicked it on, ah,

01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:45.980
I nicked it on, on the door
getting out of this old car,

01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:48.060
just clumsy is all.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.510
>>All right, so what is this,
a early morning meeting?

01:23:54.710 --> 01:23:56.460
>>Hog hunting.

01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:59.040
>>Really now?

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.300
>>That's right, "Showing this
city slicker how it's done,"

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:03.420
he said, so.

01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.310
>>In those?

01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:07.870
>>Oh, God, I hope not,

01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:11.960
I mean, these are, these are
way too expensive to get dirty.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.530
>>No, I won't do that to you,
I got some mucks for him.

01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:16.840
>>Oh, good.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.840
You're welcome to join
if you'd like, Sheriff.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:23.970
>>Oh, no, Shelby here uses a
bow, that's a young man's game,

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:26.850
too much running around for me.

01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:30.200
I like, I like to keep
a distance, you know?

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:32.460
So they don't see me coming.

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:34.900
>>Well, now I know
what I'm in for.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:36.510
>>Yeah, you do.

01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:43.860
So Caroline, Mila, they're
still back in Tupelo way

01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:45.910
or what's going on?

01:24:46.110 --> 01:24:48.090
>>Yes, sir, yeah, through
the week, I reckon.

01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:49.220
>>Ah-huh.

01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:50.790
>>You know, Mila just, ah,

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:53.520
just loves that little
house there on Kent Street.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.620
>>Shelby, talk to you.

01:24:56.820 --> 01:24:58.350
>>Yeah, you guys get it.

01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:09.750
You seen Trey?

01:25:11.010 --> 01:25:13.420
>>Oh, no, not since last
week when he was here.

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:14.840
>>Mm-hm.

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.540
We found his car.

01:25:18.670 --> 01:25:19.860
>>No shit?

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:23.460
>>No shit, Firestone
Factory all banged up.

01:25:24.330 --> 01:25:25.690
>>Hell.
>>Mm-hm.

01:25:25.890 --> 01:25:27.810
>>Not considered missing, is he?

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.160
>>You okay?

01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:35.820
>>Yeah, just getting
ready to get out there.

01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:41.830
>>You wanna tell me something?

01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:44.000
Anything?

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.360
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:52.540
>>That robbery at the
clinic a few days ago.

01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.280
>>Mm-hm.

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.970
>>I, ah, I think that was Trey.

01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:59.410
>>You do now?

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:03.990
>>Yeah and then the
murder of the, ah,

01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:06.030
the doctor I heard
about last night,

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:10.340
yeah, I think
maybe Trey's trying

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:12.910
to, I don't know, clean up.

01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.990
>>Hm, well.

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:17.700
>>I'm real worried
about him, Uncle Bodie.

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:20.310
>>Yeah, it was more than 100 K,

01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:23.910
that could change a man's
life, could ruin it.

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:27.180
You telling the truth?

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.410
All right,

01:26:32.610 --> 01:26:35.270
now you, you tell me
if you run into Trey.

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:37.450
>>Will do.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.460
>>Now what's your name again?

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:41.900
>>Fred.

01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:43.380
>>Fred, it's a pleasure.

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.060
>>Nice meeting you, Sheriff.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:50.690
>>Now you be careful
of them hogs there.

01:26:50.890 --> 01:26:54.560
They're ugly bastards and
they'll get your goose

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.130
and they'll put a tusk
right straight through you,

01:26:57.330 --> 01:26:58.740
like it was nothing,

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:00.950
leave you out there
on the field bleeding.

01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:04.880
>>Jesus.

01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.740
Thanks for the warning.

01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:12.140
>>All right, well,
get after it, yep.

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:13.830
>>See you, Sheriff.

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:49.530
>>Get on the horn to Tupelo PD,

01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:53.400
get me an APB on Caroline
and Mila Conners.

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:55.740
Get Caroline's maiden name

01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:58.880
and Kent Street,
that's all I got.

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.800
Ben, do it now.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.970
>>10-4, Bodie.
>>I'll see you at the office.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.890
>>What did you have
to say over there?

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:13.470
>>Just looking for
the guy you killed

01:28:13.670 --> 01:28:15.510
with the trash bag is all.

01:28:15.710 --> 01:28:16.500
>>And where is he?

01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.420
>>Gone.

01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:26.860
>>It's almost that
time, take me to my car.

01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:52.560
>>You gonna stab me
or slit my throat?

01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:55.910
>>Maybe both.

01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:05.480
>>Who's the battle ax?

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:11.540
>>The one who taught me it's
not how hard you swing it,

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.140
but how sharp it is.

01:30:23.530 --> 01:30:25.200
>>So let me get this straight,

01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:30.420
small town race car
driver with Parkinson's

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:32.860
struggles to make ends meet

01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:35.860
for his wife and
his little daughter.

01:30:38.430 --> 01:30:39.210
Goddamn!

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:45.230
>>We all play the hand
we're dealt, I guess.

01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:46.910
>>And you're still going,

01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.270
still fighting the
good fight left in you.

01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:54.530
>>That's what we do.

01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:56.920
>>Who's we?

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:06.070
>>Us, all of us, I
don't fucking know.

01:31:06.270 --> 01:31:07.670
>>Not all of us.

01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:16.640
>>What the fuck do you care?

01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:18.950
Huh?

01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:23.470
Fuck, man, after last night,

01:31:24.690 --> 01:31:25.830
after this whole damn week,

01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:27.870
you wanna just keep
shitting on me?

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.880
You killed my wife's brother,

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:33.830
you made me kill that woman.

01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:37.010
I took money from the
wrong fucking people,

01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:40.850
I get it, Jesus Christ.

01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:43.320
Look, I'm doing
everything you say.

01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:46.410
I'm just trying to get
my fucking life back,

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:48.890
whatever life I got left.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:55.510
>>We're all going in
the same direction.

01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:58.940
>>Even you?

01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:01.690
>>Oh, I know I am.

01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:05.920
That's the difference between me

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.910
and people in places like this,

01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:10.390
oblivious.

01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:16.050
>>Yeah, you keep talking about
how it's all meaningless.

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:20.790
You just do that to justify
the horrible shit you do.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:26.540
There's a world where
all this has meaning,

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:29.540
it's this one.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.520
>>You don't have to be alone.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:46.520
Here at Healy
Family Funeral Home,

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:50.050
we will be by your side as
you navigate this special time

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.570
with quality, affordable
services and headstones,

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:56.310
we offer a variety of packages.

01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:58.740
>>Christ, you can
count on that, huh?

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:04.010
When your business is
death in a town like this,

01:33:05.050 --> 01:33:09.240
business is booming,
half off headstones.

01:33:09.440 --> 01:33:12.160
When people are killing
themselves for pennies

01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:14.770
and then taking
them for some rocks

01:33:14.970 --> 01:33:16.290
to put over your rotting body.

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:17.800
>>Or call us, 4249.

01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:24.390
>>When my folks died,

01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:27.040
they didn't have two of those
pennies to rub together.

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.650
It took me years to
save up to replace

01:33:29.850 --> 01:33:33.610
that shitty, wooden
gravestone the church donated.

01:33:33.810 --> 01:33:38.440
>>And what was the point?

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:40.620
>>That we should
all be so lucky,

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:42.580
just to have a
proper place to rest,

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:44.800
when this is all said and done,

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.310
something that says,
"Hey, we were here."

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:51.190
>>Hm.

01:33:56.710 --> 01:33:58.110
I was nine years old,

01:33:59.190 --> 01:34:00.860
I came home from school

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.680
and I found my dad dead
on the kitchen floor.

01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:08.940
Blew his head off
with a shotgun,

01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:11.910
not before putting two
shells into my mom,

01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:13.430
while she was in the bath.

01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:23.570
Shit, coroner took them, I
watched, no clue where to.

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.840
Some distant relative
probably thought it was best

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.880
for everyone that they burned
them and tossed the ashes.

01:34:34.190 --> 01:34:35.940
I don't know.

01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:46.920
>>Where are they?

01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:48.920
>>They're safe.

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:52.620
I told you, you got
my word on that.

01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:53.960
>>So this is him, huh?

01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:58.970
>>Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, what is this, huh?

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:00.880
>>He doesn't know?

01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:03.710
>>Know what?

01:36:06.890 --> 01:36:09.850
>>Well, go on.

01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:19.770
>>No, no, I did everything
you asked, all of it.

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:22.870
>>You did.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:29.910
>>You said you don't
kill the innocent,

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:31.780
you said that.

01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:38.830
>>I saw you kill that woman,
Shel, I watched you do it.

01:36:55.270 --> 01:36:59.030
>>Fuck!

01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:06.340
>>We're all heading
the same way.

01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.740
>>Yeah.

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.710

01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:27.800
>>I believe so.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.930

01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:32.850

01:37:33.050 --> 01:37:34.640
