Narrator: Previously
on "Will And Grace."

00:04.338 --> 00:06.474
Do you have any idea
what I have sacrificed

00:06.507 --> 00:08.276
for you and this baby?

00:08.309 --> 00:10.144
Sacrifice? What, uh,
w-- what do you mean?

00:10.178 --> 00:13.581
- I just broke up with Vince!
- What?

00:13.614 --> 00:15.483
Oh, my God! Why?

00:15.516 --> 00:18.619
Because I wouldn't put him
before my commitment to you.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.288
Hey, it was the hardest thing
I've ever done,

00:20.321 --> 00:22.123
but I did it, for you!

00:22.156 --> 00:25.059
- Well, who asked you to?
- Excuse me?

00:25.093 --> 00:28.229
Will, don't we, uh...

00:28.262 --> 00:30.098
Don't we want each other
to be happy?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.466
I mean, if-- if Vince
makes you happy,

00:32.500 --> 00:35.303
you never should've left him!

00:35.336 --> 00:37.505
And if I have a possibility
of being happy with Leo,

00:37.538 --> 00:40.608
you should want that for me,
instead of making me feel guilty

00:40.641 --> 00:42.110
about wanting a relationship

00:42.143 --> 00:44.178
with the real father
of my child!

00:45.146 --> 00:46.114
Well, tell me this, Grace.

00:46.147 --> 00:49.450
If-- if-- if Leo
cancelled his wedding for you,

00:49.483 --> 00:51.219
why hasn't he called?

00:52.586 --> 00:54.622
[laughs]
God!

00:54.655 --> 00:57.258
I cannot believe
you are doing this to me again!

00:57.291 --> 00:58.292
We're gonna have
a baby together,

00:58.326 --> 01:01.162
then Leo shows up
and I'm out of the picture.

01:01.195 --> 01:04.198
You know what?
An hour ago, I put you first.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.466
Why was I stupid enough to think

01:05.499 --> 01:07.101
that you would
ever do the same for me?

01:07.135 --> 01:09.403
Will, I am not choosing
between the two of you.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.471
Look, okay, okay, listen.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.373
We just need to breathe

01:12.406 --> 01:13.574
and just calm down here, okay?

01:13.607 --> 01:15.176
Nothing has even happened.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.611
Let's just, let's just
start over, okay?

01:18.879 --> 01:21.215
Okay. Answer me this.

01:23.251 --> 01:26.086
If you're in Rome,
raising this baby with Leo...

01:27.655 --> 01:28.689
where am I?

01:30.458 --> 01:31.392
I don't know.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.663
Well, you're gonna have
to make a decision.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.234
[theme music]

01:55.183 --> 01:56.784
[instrumental music]

01:58.486 --> 02:00.288
- Grace!
- What?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.855
Get out here!
Warren's been suspended.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.457
Grace: Suspended again?

02:11.465 --> 02:13.801
What did he do this time?

02:13.834 --> 02:16.170
He wrote on the wall
of the boy's bathroom,

02:16.204 --> 02:18.306
"Hey, fellas, for a good time,
call Will Truman."

02:19.973 --> 02:22.142
[laughs]

02:23.944 --> 02:25.813
Oh, wait. You're pissed off
'cause no one's called yet?

02:28.216 --> 02:29.116
You think that's funny,
you think it's funny

02:29.149 --> 02:30.884
that he disrespects his father
like that?

02:30.918 --> 02:32.786
- You're not my real dad.
- Hey.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.922
I gave up the love of my life
to be your father.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.190
And I gave up
the love of my life

02:36.224 --> 02:38.192
so he could be your father.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.194
Thanks. No wonder I'm so happy.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.402
Great, we're having guests over
for game night any second

02:48.436 --> 02:51.305
and I don't have time
to re-glue.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.441
- Alright, I'm out of here.
- I'm going over to Sandoval's.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.809
- Oh, no, you're not.
- You're not going anywhere.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.411
- Put down that coat!
- Put down that hat.

02:57.445 --> 02:59.847
- Do not open that door.
- Do not walk out that door.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.515
You will not close that door!

03:06.920 --> 03:08.389
Are we too hard on him?

03:10.891 --> 03:11.859
You're not really gonna
wear that, are you?

03:11.892 --> 03:14.262
Why? What's the problem with it?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.796
All the kids are wearin' it.

03:18.999 --> 03:19.833
Yeah, and from what I can see,

03:19.867 --> 03:21.869
a bunch of them
are in there with you.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.509
- Have another drink.
- Have another donut.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.843
- Fag.
- Hag.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.014
- Screw you.
- You wish.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.383
- You couldn't.
- Not because I'm gay.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.417
Because you're hideous.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.619
[knocking on door]

03:40.821 --> 03:42.823
What do you want? Time hasn't
been nice to any of us.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.559
Hey, kiddles.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.865
Hi, honey, you...
Uh, oh.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.335
I have got to remember
to buy Kool-Aid. I...

03:59.307 --> 04:01.275
Karen, how do you look
so fantastic?

04:01.309 --> 04:03.277
Oh, honey, come on.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.846
This is just Noxzema
and the love of a good man.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.950
- Where is your husband?
- Right behind me.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.852
Sorry we're late.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.158
Honey...

04:18.191 --> 04:21.495
you still have a little bit
of my lipstick on your mouth.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.364
Do you wanna get it off?

04:24.332 --> 04:25.366
Yeah.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.469
I wanna get it off.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.041
I wanna get it off right now.

04:34.074 --> 04:37.411
- Who else can use a drink?
- Come on.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.347
Bring the game over here
or we're gonna have a situation

04:39.380 --> 04:41.615
between Vampira
and the bride of Frankendyke.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.387
* Dum-dum da-dum

04:46.420 --> 04:48.356
* Step together step

04:48.389 --> 04:49.657
* Kick bolt change

04:49.690 --> 04:50.658
* Pas de bourree *

04:50.691 --> 04:52.893
* And I'm married *

04:56.129 --> 04:58.366
Where did you get married,
on the sun?

05:01.502 --> 05:04.438
That's funny.
Do you hear screaming?

05:04.472 --> 05:06.073
Oh, no, that's just the buttons
on your shirt.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.579
Anyway,
ready to meet my husband?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.514
[Karen gasps]

05:13.547 --> 05:16.584
Baby, get your cup-sized tushy
in here.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.051
Hey, what's up?

05:23.491 --> 05:25.092
You married Kevin Bacon?

05:27.060 --> 05:28.629
Stalked him all the way
to the altar.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.467
So, ahem, Kevin,
how does it feel?

05:33.501 --> 05:36.504
You know, when somethin'
is right, you, you just know it.

05:36.537 --> 05:40.007
I've-- I've never had
so much clarity in my life

05:40.040 --> 05:43.444
to love somebody
truly and forever

05:43.477 --> 05:45.379
until God takes us

05:45.413 --> 05:48.516
either from old age
or erotic asphyxiation

05:48.549 --> 05:50.050
'cause you're hangin'
upside down, you've got heels on

05:50.083 --> 05:52.386
and a scarf's tied
around your neck...

05:52.420 --> 05:55.556
What? Oh, yes, uh, sorry. Sorry.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.392
Oh, aren't we all lucky

05:58.426 --> 06:01.529
to have found the one
we truly belong with,

06:01.562 --> 06:05.533
the one who doesn't make us
feel compromised or unhappy

06:05.566 --> 06:08.636
or like we're wasting away,

06:08.669 --> 06:10.938
choking on misery and regret?

06:10.971 --> 06:12.406
Yeah, yeah. We get it.
You're happy, we're not.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.574
Let's play the damn game.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.075
Grace, let's go.
Bacon, keep score.

06:15.108 --> 06:16.677
No, I'm gonna have
to skip this round

06:16.710 --> 06:19.146
'cause I had my Kyra-Forever
tattoo lasered off

06:19.179 --> 06:20.981
and I think
it's startin' to bleed.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.055
Come on, come on. Go, go.

06:28.088 --> 06:31.191
A shirt, a bed, your tummy
and chin last summer.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.960
- Things that are tucked.
- Right.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.063
- Uh, nuts, ice.
- More.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.132
Uh, our souls, our hopes
and dreams--

06:39.166 --> 06:41.101
- Things that are crushed.
- Yes.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.536
- Go on.
- I can't go on.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.438
I can't go on, either.

06:44.472 --> 06:47.040
Grace, being with you
has ruined my life.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.108
What did you just say?

06:48.141 --> 06:49.176
Being with you...

06:49.209 --> 06:52.045
Grace: Has ruined my life.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.180
- Grace, wake up.
- What did you say?

06:53.213 --> 06:54.448
I don't understand
what you're saying--

06:54.482 --> 06:57.117
Sweetie, wake up.
Grace, wake up.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.786
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.488
You were just having
a bad dream.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.722
I was?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.724
I mean, you, you kept saying,

07:03.757 --> 07:05.726
"Bacon and huge ass."

07:09.530 --> 07:11.832
It's scary to finally
make that connection, isn't it?

07:15.102 --> 07:16.136
What was it about?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.539
I don't remember.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.609
Who cares? It's just a dream.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.544
Right. Ow!

07:23.577 --> 07:24.745
Oh, good. It's still there.
Ooh.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.748
[instrumental music]

07:38.091 --> 07:40.494
The relationship you have
with the chicken

07:40.528 --> 07:41.729
is truly remarkable.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.764
I, I can't wait for the day

07:43.797 --> 07:45.866
someone inhales
my leg and thigh like that.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.605
I don't know
what to tell you, man.

07:51.639 --> 07:55.676
Jews and chicken,
it's real and it's deep.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.612
Hey, you know,
I've been thinking

07:58.646 --> 08:00.781
about those bad dreams
you've been having.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.249
I told you,
I don't remember them.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.218
I think it's just stress
about having a baby, you know?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.256
You're okay, right, I mean,

08:09.289 --> 08:10.858
about everything
we, we talked about last week?

08:10.891 --> 08:14.762
What? Oh, yeah. Oh.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.296
It's better I stayed.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.566
And I'm glad
we're doing this together.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.100
Okay, just go do the laundry

08:20.133 --> 08:21.635
'cause I've been wearing
your Calvin Klein boxers

08:21.669 --> 08:23.737
for the last three days.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.238
- They're briefs.
- Not anymore.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.911
I'll be back in a minute.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.280
Would you like to hear a song?

08:33.313 --> 08:34.915
Yeah. Grace,
could you do me a favor?

08:34.948 --> 08:37.751
Could you not sing
to the baby anymore?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.221
Why? Music makes him smarter.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.189
[sighs]
Okay, well,

08:42.222 --> 08:43.857
if you're gonna sing,
have a glass of wine

08:43.891 --> 08:46.159
'cause he is, he's gonna
wanna be drunk for this.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.128
[door shuts]

08:50.898 --> 08:52.700
You like my singing, right?

08:55.636 --> 09:01.141
* I believe the children
are our future... *

09:01.174 --> 09:03.844
Ow! Guess what?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.714
Kicking turns up the volume.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.583
* Teach them well
and let them... **

09:09.617 --> 09:11.151
I am not getting up again.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.953
Put the laundry down
and open it yourself.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.256
Hello, Grace.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.328
- Leo?
- Oh, you...

09:21.361 --> 09:22.630
You-- you're with a chicken.
I'll go.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.931
No! No!

09:26.667 --> 09:28.168
Wait. What are you doing here?
I thought you were in Rome.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.737
I was in Rome,
but I-- I came back

09:29.770 --> 09:31.639
because there was something
I needed to say.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.140
There's something
I need to say to you, too.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.808
Grace, let me, let me just
get this out first.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.678
Um, I-- I was having lunch
in the piazza the other day

09:37.711 --> 09:40.213
and-- and I look up
for my sopressata panini,

09:40.247 --> 09:42.816
th-- that-- that's Italian
for bologna sandwich,

09:42.850 --> 09:46.386
and, uh, I, uh,
I see this really old couple

09:46.419 --> 09:48.889
holding hands
and, and kissing and...

09:48.922 --> 09:50.357
I mean, they were, they were
really going at it, you know

09:50.390 --> 09:52.259
like, in a way that

09:52.292 --> 09:54.361
you really don't ever wanna
see anybody kiss.

09:54.394 --> 09:58.799
And, uh, it-- it-- it was,
it was just, it was just gross.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.634
And, and, uh,

10:00.668 --> 10:04.905
all-- all I could think of
was, um, was you.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.307
That, that is, that is
so not what I wanted that

10:07.340 --> 10:10.210
to sound like. Um...

10:10.243 --> 10:12.312
Grace, you-- you told me
to move on

10:12.345 --> 10:14.948
and-- and I tried.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.184
I-- I tried, but I can't.

10:17.217 --> 10:21.388
And, um, I-- I guess, um,

10:21.421 --> 10:23.423
I guess what I'm tryin'
to say is, um,

10:23.456 --> 10:26.927
I-- I want that old couple
to be us, you know?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.262
I-- I-- I wanna be gross
with you.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.668
I can be gross.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.006
People tell me I'm gross
all the time.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.711
Grace, I, I love you.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.379
I, I-- I wanna be with you
forever.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.683
I wanna marry you again,
I, I wanna have babies.

10:49.717 --> 10:53.687
I, I, um, I'm-- I'm getting
ahead of myself, I know.

10:53.721 --> 10:54.654
Not really.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.360
Oh, my God.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.296
Is-- is-- is-- is...

11:03.330 --> 11:04.397
Oh, my God.

11:11.872 --> 11:13.941
[whistling]

11:13.974 --> 11:16.944
[instrumental music]

11:22.349 --> 11:24.084
[chuckles]
You know, Ben,

11:24.117 --> 11:25.853
today is my birthday.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.455
Can you say,
"My daddy is 25"?

11:30.891 --> 11:32.760
No? Okay.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.328
If you think I look 25,
eat a Cheerio.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.869
Hey!

11:41.902 --> 11:44.471
- Happy birthday.
- I think I know what that is.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.873
I've been hinting at it
all week.

11:45.906 --> 11:48.275
It's crocodile loafers
from Gucci.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.342
Damn it.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.412
Oh, no, no, no.
Vince, wait. I...

11:52.445 --> 11:54.514
Whatever it is,
I'm sure I'll love it.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.016
Of course, it's loafers.
What, do you think I'm an idiot?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.018
We wear the same size.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.287
Hi. How's my big boy?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.421
He's looking more like you
every day.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.924
Oh, really? I don't know.

12:03.957 --> 12:06.927
Sometimes I see me and sometimes
I just see the sad girl

12:06.960 --> 12:08.796
who sold her eggs
for rent money.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.134
Anybody else called to say
happy birthday

12:14.167 --> 12:15.869
while I was out with the baby?

12:15.903 --> 12:17.404
Grace didn't call, Will.
She didn't call last year.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.306
She's not calling this year.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.074
If you wanna talk to her,
you gotta make the first move.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.310
Why should I? I mean,
she's-- she's the one who--

12:23.343 --> 12:24.778
Alright, listen,
what's the one thing

12:24.812 --> 12:27.380
you always said
about you and Grace?

12:27.414 --> 12:29.817
I don't know. That we could
re-enact "Grease" in 17 minutes?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.320
What are you talkin' about?

12:33.353 --> 12:35.022
There's no way you could do
Sandy's transformation

12:35.055 --> 12:36.957
from good girl to slut
that quick.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.094
You always said
fate brought you together,

12:41.128 --> 12:42.562
fate was gonna
keep you together.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.398
[instrumental music]

12:47.835 --> 12:49.837
Ready? One, two, three.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.379
[laughing]

13:03.450 --> 13:05.152
Okay, daddy, don't get mad.
There you go.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.555
Leo: Oh-ho-ho!

13:08.588 --> 13:12.492
Don't get mad but, uh,
somebody spilled, thank you,

13:12.525 --> 13:15.495
some baby oil
inside your briefcase.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.565
Oh, how could I be mad
at somebody I love so much, huh?

13:18.598 --> 13:20.067
Good, 'cause it was me.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.504
And you blame it on Lila?

13:24.537 --> 13:26.406
I'm startin' to think
she's not the midnight farter.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.412
You know, maybe we should go
upstairs and change the sheets

13:32.445 --> 13:34.481
'cause somebody peed in our bed
last night.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.017
Or did she?

13:39.019 --> 13:41.388
Yes, and I already changed them.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.957
Ready to go to the zoo?
Let's go.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.558
Isn't there a phone call
you should make first, Grace?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.396
Leo, are you gonna do this
every year?

13:49.429 --> 13:51.031
Give him a call.
It's his birthday.

13:51.064 --> 13:52.165
Come on, he's your best friend.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.134
No, no, no.
He's not my best friend.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.937
My best friend
would've returned my calls

13:56.970 --> 13:59.172
when I left a hundred messages
begging for forgiveness.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.409
My best friend
would've put aside his anger

14:02.442 --> 14:04.177
and showed up
for the birth of my daughter.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.146
That's what my best friend
would've done.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.016
So let's put it all aside

14:09.049 --> 14:11.551
and let's go to the zoo.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.486
Hey, who put the half-eaten
chicken leg in my pocket?

14:17.657 --> 14:19.893
Give your daughter a break.
It's deep and it's real.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.299
[instrumental music]

14:27.600 --> 14:29.469
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, Kar.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.374
What's the story,
drunk and whore-y?

14:37.310 --> 14:38.578
Well, we need to do somethin'

14:38.611 --> 14:40.580
to get Will and Grace
back together.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.983
Honey, it's been
almost two years.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.418
Oh. Well, why does it always
fall on us to help those two?

14:45.452 --> 14:47.554
I know, poodle.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.090
You know, sometimes it seems
like our sole purpose in life

14:50.123 --> 14:53.660
is just to serve
Will and Grace.

14:53.693 --> 14:57.297
Right, it's like all people see
when they look at us,

14:57.330 --> 14:59.432
they're the supporting players
on the "Will And Grace" show.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.606
But, you know, to be fair,

15:06.639 --> 15:08.575
we couldn't really have
our own show.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.577
I mean, we're fun
for poops and giggles,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.479
but it'd get silly
after a while.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.482
Not enough heart.

15:17.150 --> 15:21.488
So how to get Will and Grace
in the same room?

15:21.521 --> 15:24.424
- Hm...
- Oh, I know.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.160
Let's take an idea
from this book I'm reading.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.997
We can ask them both to go up
a hill and get a pail of water.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.369
Then they can just
meet up there.

15:38.005 --> 15:41.474
Yeah, but we'll never get Grace
up to the top of a hill.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.415
I mean, unless there's
a French-fry factory up there.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.988
Oh! Jackie, wait a minute.
I just had an even better idea.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.089
- What?
- Well, honey.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.357
I can't tell you over the phone.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.026
Oh, of course.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.463
[instrumental music]

16:06.699 --> 16:09.136
- Jack?
- 'Dr. Mutchnick, Radiology...'

16:09.169 --> 16:13.140
Oh, oh, I am so sorry. I...

16:13.173 --> 16:16.676
Look, I, I want you to know
I am there for you

16:16.709 --> 16:19.112
because I, I love you, buddy.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.780
A-- and God knows
I owe you so much.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.383
I mean, you, you were the one
that helped me come out,

16:23.416 --> 16:25.018
you know, so if there's anything
I can do--

16:25.052 --> 16:25.985
Back off, fruitcake.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.789
I'm sorry.
I thought you were my friend.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.491
Well, I'm not, pickle-biter.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.429
Leviticus 20:13 says,
"If a man lies with another man"

16:36.463 --> 16:37.197
"as he does with a woman..."

16:37.230 --> 16:38.598
Alright, shut up!

16:40.467 --> 16:41.301
There's obviously
been a mistake.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.503
I don't know why
they sent me in here.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.571
Karen?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.541
- Grace.
- Will.

16:48.575 --> 16:52.112
Man on PA: Dr. Kohan,
extension 456...

16:52.145 --> 16:54.147
If you're looking for Jack,
that's not him.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.815
Jack? I thought it was Karen.
Jack told me that she was--

16:55.848 --> 16:57.684
No, no. Karen told me
that Jack was...

16:58.818 --> 17:00.720
Wow.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.556
We just fell for the dumbest
version of "Parent Trap" ever.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.498
God, I am...

17:13.566 --> 17:15.535
I don't know what to say. Um...

17:16.669 --> 17:18.105
Happy birthday?

17:20.740 --> 17:21.741
Thank you.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.582
I don't suppose you have...

17:29.616 --> 17:32.619
time for a piece
of cafeteria cake?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.754
Sure, I could do that.

17:34.787 --> 17:35.788
Man #1: "Remember,
the Lord said"

17:35.822 --> 17:38.291
"that blood will be
upon all the homosexuals"

17:38.325 --> 17:40.160
"and they will surely feel
the crispy..."

17:44.797 --> 17:45.665
Call me?

17:46.633 --> 17:48.668
[instrumental music]

17:50.237 --> 17:51.738
Honey, you know what I love
about our plan

17:51.771 --> 17:53.806
to pay Arthur Mirisch
to direct Will and Grace

17:53.840 --> 17:55.642
to the hospital room
of a total stranger

17:55.675 --> 17:58.178
in a full body cast whose face
is covered in bandages,

17:58.211 --> 17:59.746
each one of them thinking
it's one of us in that bed

17:59.779 --> 18:01.248
with our bones broken?

18:03.316 --> 18:05.152
- What?
- The simplicity.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.756
We have so much
to celebrate, Kar.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.225
Will and Grace are makin' up
as we speak.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.860
You got a huge divorce
settlement.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.129
- Hey, let's get a dessert.
- Huh?

18:16.163 --> 18:17.130
Nothing too filling.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.866
Something small and fruity
with ladyfingers.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.768
Well, well, well.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.508
Karen Walker in the flesh,

18:28.541 --> 18:30.710
whose flesh is unclear.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.746
Why, Beverley Leslie.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.915
What are you doing
later tonight, honey?

18:35.948 --> 18:38.251
I'm having a few friends over
for a game of Monopoly

18:38.285 --> 18:40.153
and I'm missing
one of the pieces.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.791
Excuse me, Mrs. Walker,

18:44.824 --> 18:46.693
there's a question
about your credit card.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.596
Can I speak to you privately
for a moment?

18:49.629 --> 18:52.732
Credit card? Oh...
[laughing]

18:52.765 --> 18:54.701
That's probably
just Marlo Thomas

18:54.734 --> 18:55.768
getting me back for the time

18:55.802 --> 18:58.938
that I made Driver
poop in her kitty litter box.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.573
Excuse me a moment.

19:01.341 --> 19:04.211
[indistinct chatter]

19:09.949 --> 19:12.652
Yeah. Nice seeing you again.

19:14.587 --> 19:16.256
I'm sure
you have places to go...

19:17.857 --> 19:19.692
a magic ring to protect.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.333
You may or may not know this,

19:26.366 --> 19:28.701
but my business associate,
Bengie, and I

19:28.735 --> 19:31.638
have come
to a parting of the ways.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.807
And I thought
you two would last forever.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.810
You were definitely
the most stable, in-the-closet,

19:37.844 --> 19:39.579
short-tall, black-white,

19:39.612 --> 19:41.648
young-old,
disgusting hot couple I know.

19:43.283 --> 19:47.754
The point is I'm looking
for a new business associate.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.359
Maybe you might be interested.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.861
Uh, no, thanks.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.629
I think your car is here.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.437
You think about it and remember,
I've got millions.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.408
Jack: Come on, Karen, let's go.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.411
[indistinct chatter]

20:13.280 --> 20:14.747
It's over, Jackie.

20:16.383 --> 20:17.750
It's all gone.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.752
What is?
What are you talking about?

20:19.786 --> 20:21.888
I just got off the phone
with my accountant.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.358
It turns out everything Stan had
was borrowed,

20:25.392 --> 20:28.461
so my divorce settlement
is worthless.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.264
Honey, I'm broke.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.471
[theme music]
