00:02.369 --> 00:04.268
I'm your friend.
We had an accidental kiss

00:04.270 --> 00:05.569
that even you said
was a mistake

00:05.571 --> 00:07.004
because you have a girlfriend.

00:07.006 --> 00:09.172
I'm so glad
I wrote you that letter.

00:09.174 --> 00:10.440
You're dead to me,
Jenna Hamilton.

00:10.442 --> 00:12.108
I don't want to be friends.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.310
I want to be more.

00:15.006 --> 00:18.039
The weekly hump day
of high school

00:18.041 --> 00:20.041
was usually a day
without fanfare,

00:20.043 --> 00:22.910
and yet, I couldn't shake
the gnarly feeling in my gut,

00:22.912 --> 00:24.612
and on first intuit,

00:24.614 --> 00:27.781
I was convinced Amanda Tankersly
was having another seizure.

00:27.783 --> 00:29.717
Students chanting:
Fight! Fight! Fight...

00:29.719 --> 00:31.718
Or there was a fight.

00:31.720 --> 00:35.622
Students:
Fight! Fight! Fight...

00:35.624 --> 00:36.990
For two weeks,
Tamara had tortured me

00:36.992 --> 00:38.692
with her silence.

00:38.694 --> 00:40.161
And if she didn't break
the silence soon,

00:40.163 --> 00:42.863
I was starting to doubt that
we'd ever be friends again.

00:42.865 --> 00:45.533
Jenna? Jenna?

00:45.535 --> 00:48.069
Why would you kiss
Jenna Hamilton?

00:48.071 --> 00:50.171
There's the bitch!
Sic her!

00:50.173 --> 00:52.373
No. Lis, look,
it's not her fault.

00:52.375 --> 00:55.343
She didn't do anything wrong.
Aah!

00:55.345 --> 01:00.214
Watching an emotional
train wreck was awesome...

Not you, Rebecca.
God!

01:19.702 --> 01:22.758
They're calling it "the slap
heard across the quad."

01:22.966 --> 01:24.070
- It already has a name?
- Yes.

01:24.072 --> 01:25.739
But it totally needs a rewrite.

01:25.741 --> 01:27.274
It should have been called
"the smack attack."

01:27.276 --> 01:28.575
- Which it was.
- No joke.

01:28.577 --> 01:30.110
You've gotta tell me,
what was numbnuts saying

01:30.112 --> 01:31.278
before she knocked you back?

01:31.280 --> 01:32.913
I think she was
speaking in tongues.

01:32.915 --> 01:34.682
She is so jacked up on Jesus!

01:34.684 --> 01:36.550
I'm glad we're friends again.

01:36.552 --> 01:38.085
We're not.

01:38.087 --> 01:41.088
It was a friendship
drive-by.

01:41.090 --> 01:44.525
This is Lissa's
circle of trust, okay?

01:44.527 --> 01:47.128
And this...Is you.

01:47.130 --> 01:49.797
What we need to do is get you

01:49.799 --> 01:51.265
back into Lissa's circle.

01:51.267 --> 01:53.434
I will be a neutral listener

01:53.436 --> 01:55.303
to help guide you
in the right direction.

01:55.305 --> 01:56.571
Feel free to open up.

01:56.573 --> 01:58.039
I'll be completely objective.

01:58.041 --> 02:00.042
I trusted you. You said
you would never lie to me,

02:00.044 --> 02:02.310
and now you've humiliated me
in front of the entire school!

02:02.312 --> 02:04.813
- I didn't lie to you.
- Oh, liar.

02:04.815 --> 02:06.981
No, I...
I told you the truth

02:06.983 --> 02:09.351
it's just...
it took me a while

02:09.353 --> 02:11.051
to figure out
<i>how</i> to tell you.

02:11.054 --> 02:12.620
Sometimes men feel like

02:12.622 --> 02:15.352
if they tell you about
the cheating, it makes it okay.

02:15.518 --> 02:17.324
It doesn't.
It's selfish.

02:17.326 --> 02:19.292
And doing it publicly
was really douchey.

02:19.294 --> 02:21.561
And now,
everyone probably thinks

02:21.563 --> 02:22.996
I'm unstable.

02:22.998 --> 02:25.732
Honey, that probably
has more to do

than your outburst,

02:26.835 --> 02:29.769

Lis, I'm...Sorry.

02:33.241 --> 02:35.909
And I feel horrible?

02:35.911 --> 02:38.459
And I never meant
to kiss Jenna.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.413
It was an impulsive mistake.

02:40.415 --> 02:42.048
And if you want to break up,

02:42.050 --> 02:43.383
I mean, I'll totally understand.

02:43.385 --> 02:45.084
I don't want to break up.
Do you want to break up?

02:45.086 --> 02:48.288
Well, as long as
we're being honest here...

Owning up to being a manwhore
is not an easy task.

02:57.099 --> 03:00.001
Now we need
to make things right. Lissa,

03:00.003 --> 03:02.804
what can Jake do to get back
into your circle of trust?

03:02.806 --> 03:06.675
He can give me...

I don't want to
put you in the middle either,

03:22.359 --> 03:23.725
but Tamara only talks to me

03:23.727 --> 03:25.193
after I've been
physically assaulted.

03:25.195 --> 03:28.129
- Do you want me to hit you?
- No.

03:28.131 --> 03:30.164
Can't you guys
get over it already?

03:30.166 --> 03:32.299
You kissed her crush.
She wrote the heinous letter.

03:32.301 --> 03:33.667
The way I see it, you're even.

03:33.669 --> 03:36.469
I just need you to bring her
to the sanctuary.

03:36.471 --> 03:39.405
- How am I supposed to do that?
- Lie.

03:39.407 --> 03:44.576
I'll try,
but I'm not good at it.

03:44.578 --> 03:48.012
Hey, home wrecker!

03:48.014 --> 03:49.881
Did I cross the line?
No.

03:49.883 --> 03:50.882
The line is across my cheek.

03:50.884 --> 03:52.250
You can probably still see it.

03:52.252 --> 03:53.951
So were you ever gonna tell me
you kissed my best friend?

03:53.953 --> 03:55.219
I didn't kiss Jake.

03:55.221 --> 03:56.721
He practically
walked into my face.

03:56.723 --> 03:58.923
- How 'bout I walk into it?
- [Chuckles]

03:58.925 --> 04:00.224

more than enough action

04:00.226 --> 04:01.692
for one day.
That's too bad,

04:01.694 --> 04:03.928
'cause I was hoping
we could hook up tonight.

04:03.930 --> 04:06.064
For the record, hooking up
involves my face.

04:06.066 --> 04:08.333
I meant,
do you want to get together?

04:08.335 --> 04:10.269
- Clothes on or off?
- Optional.

04:10.271 --> 04:12.037
But you should probably
wear something to start.

Kind of hard to
take you out to dinner

04:14.676 --> 04:16.341
My boobs don't hang low.

04:17.745 --> 04:20.180
Unfortunately,
so does everyone else.

04:20.182 --> 04:22.817
- So, dinner?
- Yeah.

04:22.819 --> 04:25.052
Are you asking me out?

04:25.054 --> 04:27.221
Are you always this difficult?

04:27.223 --> 04:28.922
I don't know.
Ask Jake.

04:28.924 --> 04:33.726
Okay, Jenna...
Will you go out with me?

04:33.728 --> 04:35.929
I thought you'd never ask.

04:35.931 --> 04:40.799
I'll text you later.

rested in Ming's hands.

I was worried.

why would you show me?

Ricky Schwartz,

05:12.466 --> 05:14.232
but it wasn't my fault...
I was drugged.

05:14.234 --> 05:15.967
And I'm pretty sure he was
the one who kissed me first.

05:15.969 --> 05:17.435
- I'm not ready to forgive you.
- Why?

05:17.437 --> 05:19.737

and for much worse things.

about the kiss?

18:30.643 --> 18:31.717
I should go.

18:32.823 --> 18:34.029
Sorry to bother you.

18:38.729 --> 18:39.818
Bye.

18:42.913 --> 18:47.397
{pub}- Hey, who was that?
- Just someone, a friend... thing.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.714
- What have they done to you?
- My pores are clogged.

18:52.055 --> 18:54.633
You shouldn't leave me alone with your
friends they're falling in love with me.

18:58.654 --> 19:00.556
What did she say? Was she crying?

19:00.722 --> 19:03.642
I bet the freak is sharpening
her razor blades right now.

19:03.808 --> 19:05.247
I can't believe you wrote this.

19:05.372 --> 19:06.984
But now, I know that I can trust you.

19:07.109 --> 19:09.321
And everything will be better
from here and now.

19:09.856 --> 19:12.067
You're right, it will be.
'Cause we're done.

19:12.233 --> 19:14.705
Now we can get pizza.
I was thinking Mama Joe's.

19:14.830 --> 19:16.489
- Or maybe.
- I don't think you understand.

19:16.655 --> 19:18.491
We are done.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.511
I want nothing to do with you or Sadie,
you two are evil.

19:21.636 --> 19:22.995
Babe, you're overreacting.

19:24.115 --> 19:26.247
- Get out of the car.
- No.

19:27.147 --> 19:28.918
Fine, then I'll leave.

19:29.674 --> 19:31.521
We have to do something.

19:32.658 --> 19:34.632
It's okay, I totally
forgive you for the outburst.

19:35.042 --> 19:36.163
Have a nice walk home.

19:37.947 --> 19:41.847
This is not a guard gated community,
we're not safe!

19:44.547 --> 19:47.645
I see how it is: You use me
for my hair tips and then you leave.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.980
We could fire up
another game of dirty little secret.

19:50.584 --> 19:51.565
No, that's okay.

19:55.542 --> 19:58.305
- I don't think he wrote the letter.
- I'll be right back.

20:09.783 --> 20:12.044
<i>The Matty investigation
was inconclusive.</i>

20:12.681 --> 20:14.008
<i>But if I was a judge,</i>

20:28.094 --> 20:29.854
