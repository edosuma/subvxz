WEBVTT

00:26.200 --> 00:27.600
Where are you guys going?

00:28.840 --> 00:31.000
I'll get you, you fucking bitches!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.640
I've got killer whales
that hunt on my command.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.640
You better watch your back
because Tilikum's coming!

00:37.640 --> 00:40.120
- Where are they going?
- Where the fuck do you think?

00:40.240 --> 00:42.640
To find people and food.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.280
And sexual partners.

00:44.280 --> 00:46.200
Is that the whole class?

00:47.080 --> 00:49.200
Sandy, did they steal your boat?

00:49.200 --> 00:52.960
Yeah, and all the kayaks and all
the canoes and the dead fucking chicken.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.880
Some party, Amelia.

00:57.120 --> 01:00.520
Wait! Guys!

01:01.400 --> 01:02.800
I overslept!

01:02.800 --> 01:05.720
Guys, for the love of God,
don't leave me here!

01:13.560 --> 01:14.760
Hey, buddy.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.080
Breakfast's ready.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.400
Please come and eat, Amelia.
We've just boiled the last school shoe.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.880
You got to get it while you can
because we're moving on to carpet next.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.040
Hey, have you ever tried
a positivity journal?

01:31.800 --> 01:33.920
I hear those things can rewire your brain.

01:36.080 --> 01:39.560
Or what about, um...
What about that laugh therapy thing?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.600
You want to try that?

01:42.240 --> 01:45.080
It's gonna be really weird at first,
but I'll do it with you, okay? You ready?

01:45.560 --> 01:46.840
One, two, three.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.600
Stop trying to fix me, Zoe.
I'm not going to fight this.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.320
This is a perfectly natural reaction
to the situation.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.200
But there's people out there.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.080
We just gotta wait for the others
to find them and bring back help.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.040
It's been 18 days, Zoe.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.560
It's adorable you think
they're ever coming back.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.840
It's not like they've got
a bloody mega yacht, you know.

02:15.840 --> 02:17.360
It's going to take them a minute.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.960
Either that or they're dead.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.320
Is that it?

02:39.320 --> 02:40.680
But the insole's got the most nourishment,

02:40.680 --> 02:42.600
- and I'm eating for two.
-  I'm eating for two.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.520
It's annoying,
but she's right, guys.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.680
Oh, whatever.
I'm leaving soon, okay?

02:48.680 --> 02:51.200
And if those bitches hadn't
stolen my boat, I'd be out there

02:51.200 --> 02:54.200
eating gull right now,
not sensible fucking shoes.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.200
Any luck?

02:57.200 --> 03:00.720
Not really.
She's like a phone without a signal.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.480
Ooh! Where did we get
sea salt flakes from?

03:03.480 --> 03:04.440
Dandruff.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.840
It just adds, like, a little
something-something. Here.

03:06.840 --> 03:07.840
Okay.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.920
There she goes again.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.360
I don't think she's ever
been out this long before.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.480
Don't waste it.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.640
Stop!

03:46.960 --> 03:50.120
Guys, it's time.
We need to discuss it again.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.640
-  No!
- Uh-uh.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.280
- Hell, no.
- It's not an option, Renee.

03:54.520 --> 03:58.400
Okay? We just have to hang in there
until the new crops come in.

03:58.400 --> 04:01.040
And, in the meantime,
the music room's freshly renovated,

04:01.040 --> 04:02.600
the carpet's hardly been sat on.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.080
Carpet isn't food!

04:04.400 --> 04:07.000
Okay? We're never going to survive
on carpet.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.080
For weeks, our bodies have been
going through

04:09.080 --> 04:11.160
all our glycerol and ketone stores,

04:11.160 --> 04:13.840
and now they're eating away
at the muscle protein, too.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.480
People can survive for ages
on barely anything.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.640
Look at Gandhi.

04:18.640 --> 04:20.000
Look at Gwyneth Paltrow.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.000
What? Not without
their key organs failing.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.760
Guys, our bodies are
shutting down already.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.880
That stench, that is our kidneys failing.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.880
And our lungs,
they're in the process of shrinking.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.160
Our hearts will just
eventually shrivel up and give out.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.600
It's usually a heart attack
that gets you in the end.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.200
Or an infection.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.040
How is that, uh, stab wound, Zo?

04:45.040 --> 04:47.440
It's barely even festering, Renee.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Guys, there is always
a reason to keep going.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.480
- Exactly.
- Mmm.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.040
Okay.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.360
And this would be how we kept going.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.120
And I'm so tired of being hangry.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.240
Okay, Bicky, surely there are
moral implications to this.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.360
Well, I don't know.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.760
We have been eating
the body of Christ for millennia.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.800
Oh, no. No, Zoe's right. It's immoral.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.000
Oh, my God. You are overthinking this.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.880
Okay, sure, the first time I ate
that Guatemalan coast guard,

05:18.880 --> 05:21.920
I felt weird,
but then I felt fucking amazing.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.080
Okay, well, then,
if we're going to do this,

05:24.080 --> 05:27.040
we need to do it soon
before we're all too weak, right?

05:27.040 --> 05:30.240
Oh, yeah. Okay. Cool.
So who are we going to eat then?

05:30.240 --> 05:31.360
Hmm?

05:31.360 --> 05:32.520
Hmm?

05:34.840 --> 05:37.120
Yeah, that's what I thought.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.800
We're not going to eat anyone
because how would we even decide?

05:40.800 --> 05:42.160
Tribal council?

05:46.280 --> 05:47.480
Tribal council.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.160
No, no, girls,
I was joking.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.880
No, girls. I was joking.

05:58.320 --> 06:02.360
Oh, real cute.
The nun who loves reality TV.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.360
Not so fucking cute now, is it, Bicky?

06:05.600 --> 06:07.160
Wait, you dickheads!

06:22.640 --> 06:24.320
Oh, that fucking possum.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.240
Hi.

06:28.680 --> 06:33.560
I thought maybe you'd want to talk
to a, uh, professional.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.720
Obviously, you're going to have to imbue

06:36.720 --> 06:39.960
an inanimate object
with those qualities, but worked for me.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.760
Amelia, I know that this is a really
fucked-up situation,

06:44.760 --> 06:46.360
but we're worried about you.

06:48.920 --> 06:49.840
Can you hear that?

06:50.200 --> 06:51.920
You're hearing things, are you?

06:51.920 --> 06:53.280
Like what, voices, or...

06:53.280 --> 06:55.200
Wait, did Zoe put you up to this?

06:55.400 --> 06:57.600
-  Mmm...
- Amelia, please.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.400
I think maybe it's time
that we charge up the battery

07:01.400 --> 07:02.960
to give you some
electroshock therapy, yeah?

07:02.960 --> 07:05.200
You know what?
I think I will take that mop.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.800
Shut up and let me sleep.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.600
Shut up! Shut up.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.400
I mean, unless her therapist
works differently to mine,

07:19.400 --> 07:21.800
I don't think Amelia is in there
talking about her feelings.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.040
You guys talking strategy?

07:25.680 --> 07:27.120
You're not planning
to vote for me, are you?

07:27.120 --> 07:28.800
No one's voting for anyone.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.000
Shut up! Shut up!

07:32.600 --> 07:36.640
So what's your thinking in terms
of, um, personality versus physicality?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.560
Like, are you trying to weigh up
who's best in terms of meat

07:39.560 --> 07:41.440
or who's worst terms of survival value?

07:41.960 --> 07:43.840
- Well, I was thinking...
- Mm-hmm.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.240
- We could totally split the vote, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.440
And end up blindsiding [loudly] no one!

07:48.920 --> 07:50.080
You idiots.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.480
- We clearly can't rely on Zoe's vote.
- Mmm.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.120
Holy shitballs, Sandy.
Did you do all this?

08:01.520 --> 08:02.960
My boat looks amazing.

08:03.360 --> 08:06.440
Yeah, I learned some shit
out on the open sea, Zoe.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.920
And it's my boat now.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.720
Um, speaking of the open seas,

08:09.720 --> 08:12.520
you've obviously spent
quite a lot of time out there...

08:12.520 --> 08:13.760
No thanks to you.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, still feel really bad
about that. Um...

08:17.000 --> 08:19.080
Just wondering, though.
Do you think there's anywhere out there

08:19.080 --> 08:21.560
that I could get some antidepressants
for Amelia?

08:21.560 --> 08:24.480
There has to be somewhere
that hasn't been pillaged yet, right?

08:24.480 --> 08:26.360
You're thinking about it all wrong, Zoe.

08:26.880 --> 08:29.120
You need to find those who pillage.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.760
It's called Scuba City.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.400
It's this floating commune

08:36.400 --> 08:39.320
made up of scuba diving instructors
and their tour boats.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.640
Every sun-bleached,
slow-talking motherfucker

08:42.760 --> 08:45.880
who ever wrapped their lips
around a snorkel have banded together,

08:45.880 --> 08:48.400
and now they're looting
everything beneath the surface.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.840
Wait, so all of those beach bums
who failed school

08:51.840 --> 08:55.080
and, like, chase the summer,
they're fucking running shit now?

08:55.080 --> 08:56.080
Pretty much.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.720
Anything you want,
they can dive down and get.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.320
Fancy a tin of soup for dinner?

09:00.640 --> 09:01.880
There's a Costco below.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.440
I mean, antidepressants?

09:03.760 --> 09:06.320
They could definitely do
a chemist retrieval in their sleep.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.360
That's amazing. That's perfect.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.040
Yeah, it's perfect. It's amazing.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.440
No, no. You want to avoid Scuba City, Zoe.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.480
Anyone I ever knew
who couldn't pay back Scuba City

09:16.480 --> 09:18.400
wound up drowned.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.080
Fuck.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.960
Why the hell do you want
to go back out there, then?

09:24.880 --> 09:29.000
Uh, Zoe, I survived three months
just by drinking my tears alone.

09:30.880 --> 09:33.360
My weakness actually
made me resilient as fuck.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.760
I kind of want my kid thing to know
that feeling too.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.080
Teresa, as well.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.240
As long I can convince her to come.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.520
Aw, is that why you included
the second bike?

09:47.080 --> 09:49.840
Friendships, eh? They're all we've got.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.760
Yep.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.880
Until you're ready to eat a bitch.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.400
Uh, you all right?

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
Girls! Eat me.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.240
I'll do it. I'm the oldest,

10:26.640 --> 10:30.640
I'm much more likely to go to heaven
and I've found a few examples

10:30.760 --> 10:33.000
of ritualized sacrifice
in the Old Testament,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.880
which served as a theological
loophole for murder.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.080
So, what do you say?

10:37.880 --> 10:40.120
Uh, yeah, uh,

10:40.120 --> 10:43.480
I think we just need a minute, Sister.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.520
I'll say it.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.520
Who's eating mutton
when you could eat lamb?

10:51.640 --> 10:52.480
Shh!

10:52.480 --> 10:56.320
That is such a generous offer,
Sister, but...

10:57.280 --> 10:59.280
We can't eat a nun.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.280
Because of God. It would just
piss him off too much.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.920
You understand, right?

11:04.320 --> 11:06.120
But you can run the tribal council.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.120
- Girls.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.520
You've taken my little joke too far.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.280
Oh, fuck it. Mutton it is.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.640
No, no, no, no.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.520
Yes, I will run tribal council.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.520
Just give me a moment.

11:21.680 --> 11:27.080
So, Zoe, how do you feel
about the vote tonight?

11:27.080 --> 11:30.000
Uh, yeah. Look,
I'm, I'm obviously a target.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.840
I'm the only one here
who thinks this is fucking stupid.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.920
You've kept me awake
for the last time, you little shit.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.760
Where are you?

11:47.280 --> 11:49.160
Time to start thinking like a possum.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.320
Once the votes are counted,
the decision is final,

11:55.320 --> 12:00.240
and the person with the highest
amount of votes will be... eliminated.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.840
First vote.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.440
Zoe.

12:08.840 --> 12:09.800
No surprise there.

12:10.720 --> 12:11.640
Second vote.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.760
Teresa.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.960
Third vote.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.120
- Megan.
- Oh!

12:21.760 --> 12:22.680
Teresa.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.040
What?

12:25.560 --> 12:26.760
Teresa.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.600
Are you fucking serious?

12:29.200 --> 12:31.000
All I have done for months

12:31.000 --> 12:33.960
is cook and clean for you
ungrateful bitches.

12:33.960 --> 12:38.160
All while toe-less, mind you,
and this is the thanks I get?

12:38.160 --> 12:40.040
It's not personal, honestly.

12:40.040 --> 12:43.200
You've treated your body
like a temple through years of IVF.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.880
You're organic as shit, T.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.240
Well, if you are all going
to use motherhood against me,

12:49.960 --> 12:52.200
then I am going to use it to save myself.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.480
- Huh?
- What?

12:53.880 --> 12:55.440
I'm gonna raise Sandy's baby.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.360
What? Really?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.560
- The heck is this shit?
-  You'd do that for me?

13:00.520 --> 13:03.440
Yes, if it keeps the baby safe.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.640
But we're not raising it out at sea
like a couple of pirate freaks.

13:07.960 --> 13:12.320
Okay? We stay on land
and we go to Renee for weekly check-ups.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.840
Oh, okay, okay.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.560
So I'm saved or what?

13:19.080 --> 13:20.240
- Yes.
-  Yeah.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.320
I mean, mothers keep things running,
so T is safe.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.600
- Thank you.
-  Congratulations.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.600
Teresa. Does not count.

13:34.680 --> 13:35.800
- Zoe.
- Come on.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.640
That's two votes, Zoe.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.640
One vote, Megan.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Teresa.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.560
Does not count.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.080
Final vote.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.560
It's Megan.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.680
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

13:49.920 --> 13:52.960
So we have two votes, Zoe,
two votes, Megan.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.560
We have a tie.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.440
Two-for-one meal deal.

13:57.080 --> 13:57.920
Nice.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.000
Hey there, little buddy.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.600
-  Amelia?

14:05.600 --> 14:06.880
No, no!

14:11.520 --> 14:13.520
What? What do you want?

14:13.960 --> 14:14.840
You look nice.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.400
Uh, we just need you to

14:18.280 --> 14:21.800
come to tribal council
and vote in the tiebreaker, please.

14:22.120 --> 14:26.440
No, I'm doing what I promised to do
weeks ago, and I'm waiting for death.

14:26.960 --> 14:28.160
Okay? You guys should try it.

14:29.640 --> 14:30.880
Amelia!

14:32.480 --> 14:35.040
I'm trying really hard
not to regress right now.

14:35.480 --> 14:36.840
I'm trying to be gentle.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.760
And I understand that you have
a different take on the situation.

14:41.320 --> 14:45.320
But you are also kind of the reason
that we are facing this decision.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.280
Your little party really screwed us over.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.520
So, please, come and vote,

14:52.360 --> 14:57.800
because the rest of us really would love
to survive, even if you don't want to.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.800
Fine.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.920
That was a close call...

15:08.080 --> 15:09.320
to turn the bitch back on.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.600
Sure. But why am I on the chopping block?

15:20.600 --> 15:23.360
I'm sorry, but playing the fiddle
is not a survival skill.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.800
What, so we don't value art anymore?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.800
This country's never valued art.
Why start now?

15:29.040 --> 15:30.080
Amelia.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.160
Listen, I know I messed up, a lot.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.720
But there are people out there, guys,

15:36.120 --> 15:37.200
and there are other ways to survive.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.600
It's not even about choosing me
or choosing Megan.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.640
It's about choosing no one.

15:42.840 --> 15:44.160
Yeah, that... that makes sense to me.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.520
Thank you.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.800
What kind of life
is this anyway, guys?

15:48.800 --> 15:51.960
Just because human beings can survive
doesn't mean that they should.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.920
Suffering doesn't equate to meaning.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.240
Sometimes it's just suffering.

15:59.360 --> 16:02.280
No, no, no. That is not true.
That is not what I meant.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.480
There's always hope, okay?

16:04.480 --> 16:06.760
- We've survived this long, I mean...
- No.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.160
No, Zoe. It doesn't matter.
You're missing the point.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.320
None of it matters.

16:11.320 --> 16:14.440
It doesn't matter that we created
electricity or that we grew crops or,

16:14.440 --> 16:16.680
or even that there are
other people out there.

16:16.680 --> 16:20.200
Those people don't matter.
We don't matter. You don't matter.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.960
I matter.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.440
I fucking matter.
I'm the whole reason you came here.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.960
I'm the reason you're still alive,
so choose me.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.000
Please, save me.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.680
Oh, Zoe.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.120
Don't you know that you're the girl
who doesn't get chosen?

16:39.880 --> 16:42.760
But somehow you're surprised
to be standing here yet again,

16:42.760 --> 16:44.360
waiting to be eliminated.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.800
So, no, I don't choose you.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.760
But I don't choose Megan either.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.920
This is all gonna be over
for all of us soon enough.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.200
Let's not make it any harder until then.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.560
She makes good points.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.400
Yeah, actually, Zoe's fucked up a lot.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.160
- Yeah.
- Don't listen to her. She's mental.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.200
It was Zoe who trapped us at the reunion.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.080
Did you see what she was wearing?
She's unhinged.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.000
Zoe pushed Sandy out to sea.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.520
And then she made Saskia take the blame.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.200
And it was Zoe's fault the netball hoop
fell on my toe.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.960
That was an accident.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.800
Also was an accident that you killed
the last chicken at formal?

17:30.920 --> 17:34.560
- Exactly! That's why we're starving now.
- She always called me Pepé.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.240
I'm the only one who knows
how to work the radio.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.560
- She's not wrong.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.080
- So...
- True.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.960
Now that we know that
there are people out there,

17:42.960 --> 17:45.080
that's kind of more important than ever.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.280
Well, I can...

17:48.480 --> 17:49.720
I don't have any comebacks.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.800
- Megan.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.640
I vote Megan.

17:59.440 --> 18:00.800
Yeah, me, too.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.200
- No, no.
- It just makes sense.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.200
No.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.320
Same.

18:07.240 --> 18:11.040
- So sorry, Megan.
- Megan. Seems obvious to me.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.240
- What the hell?
- Megan.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.240
I vote for Megan, too.
And so does our baby.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.000
- Saskia. Oh, please, you tell them.
- Please you don't do this.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.320
- Please.
- Oh, guys, it's not personal.

18:24.440 --> 18:27.480
It's just...
If this is what the group wants, then,

18:27.480 --> 18:29.640
yeah, it's Megan. I'm sorry.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.400
Girls, this has now gone too far,
and I'm very sorry

18:33.400 --> 18:34.920
- that I played along.
-  Call it, Sister.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.400
For the greater good.

18:38.040 --> 18:38.960
Don't.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.640
The person with the highest
number of votes...

18:46.080 --> 18:47.000
is Megan.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.560
Are you serious?

18:55.800 --> 18:57.880
You're a bunch of skanks, the lot of you!

18:58.800 --> 19:00.280
Just a bunch of daughters of bitches.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.920
Yeah, walk away. I don't care.
Fuck the lot of you!

19:02.920 --> 19:04.560
You are a bunch of balls.

19:11.640 --> 19:12.800
I'm sorry.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.080
Good morning, listeners.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.560
Today is a really bad day for us.

19:26.040 --> 19:30.560
<i>Once again, our coordinates
are 34.4100 degrees south,</i>

19:31.320 --> 19:34.320
150.3037 degrees east.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.480
<i>We know that you're out there.</i>

19:38.480 --> 19:39.320
<i>Please...</i>

19:40.160 --> 19:42.800
come and save us from ourselves.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.560
How are we all feeling today?

19:51.960 --> 19:52.880
Excited?

19:52.880 --> 19:56.800
You good? Okay. All right,
let's see what we have here.

19:57.480 --> 19:58.760
It's obviously a baby.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.320
Or is it?

20:01.520 --> 20:02.720
No, no. I...

20:03.040 --> 20:04.520
A vibrator, really?

20:04.520 --> 20:06.280
- Please.
- Just go with it, okay?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.440
Okay. Might be a little bit cold.

20:12.080 --> 20:17.080
By my estimations,
you're about four months along.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.880
Do you wanna hear the heartbeat?

20:19.560 --> 20:21.320
Well, it would sound
a little bit like this.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.800
Really?

20:30.560 --> 20:33.160
Really, this is, this is working for you?

20:34.520 --> 20:37.320
Yeah. Sorry.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.920
It's just, this is all I've ever wanted.

20:41.800 --> 20:44.240
But I had to talk myself
out of it months ago.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.560
You know, thinking
that it would never happen.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.160
Well, it's happening
in about seven months.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.000
-  Five.
- Five.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.280
Maths, I...

20:58.920 --> 21:02.080
You'll get your baby, Teresa, and I'll go.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.720
Once I deliver the... thing,

21:05.720 --> 21:09.280
I'll sail off and leave you to it.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.080
What, Sandy?
No one is asking you to leave.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.400
Oh, please.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.480
No one wants me here.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.680
You could not wait for me
to leave in Grade 12.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.880
And Zoe and Saskia pushed me
out to sea first chance they got.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.000
Oh...

21:23.960 --> 21:26.680
Even when I tried to join
that group of Guatemalan coast guards,

21:26.680 --> 21:27.800
they cut me loose, too.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.080
I mean, didn't you say
you ate one?

21:31.200 --> 21:32.560
Okay, so they had grounds.

21:32.680 --> 21:38.240
But the point is, I am a lone wolf now,
and I belong at sea.

21:42.480 --> 21:43.400
Sandy,

21:44.320 --> 21:48.080
you... are an absolute psycho.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.640
Thank you.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.960
But we want you here.

21:53.240 --> 21:57.400
Okay? And there is literally no one else
I would want to raise this kid with

21:59.040 --> 22:00.320
than my best friend.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.920
Oh, you guys!

22:13.200 --> 22:14.600
Fuck off, Renee!

22:15.440 --> 22:16.880
This is our moment.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.720
Oh!

23:23.920 --> 23:26.560
Oh, no, no, no...

23:27.440 --> 23:28.760
What...

24:18.600 --> 24:20.440
Yeah, I know. I know.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.640
It's not like I can whip out
a violin at a barbecue

24:22.640 --> 24:24.520
to try to get a singalong going.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.440
I get it. No hard feelings, guys.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.800
No, I beg to differ.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.280
The Corrs, Dave Matthews Band,

24:31.280 --> 24:33.760
the orchestral drum
of the "Thong Song," iconic.

24:35.160 --> 24:36.400
I'll do it.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.720
I volunteer to be sacrificed instead.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.960
Wait, really?

24:44.440 --> 24:47.040
Yeah. Look, I'm done.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.120
I've lost hope.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.640
You guys haven't, so...

24:52.080 --> 24:55.120
If it helps you go on,
then that's, that's what I'll do.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.880
- Fucking fuck!

24:58.880 --> 25:01.800
- All right, guys, a little insensitive.
- Are you sure, Amelia?

25:02.680 --> 25:03.840
Yeah. I'm sure.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.880
But none of this
<i>Picnic at Hanging Rock</i> shit, all right?

25:07.880 --> 25:09.560
- I don't want to see any...

25:14.120 --> 25:16.040
What, did you want to give her
a chance to chicken out?

25:16.920 --> 25:17.840
No.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.440
We either do this now,
or we're not going to do it at all.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.120
The minute she said
that shit to me last night,

25:23.120 --> 25:24.560
she was pretty much dead to me anyway.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.040
So, I'm going to take care of this, okay?

25:27.920 --> 25:28.840
For all of us.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.920
But then no more,
"Zoe always fucks shit up."

25:32.920 --> 25:36.120
Okay? No more, "Zoe doesn't matter,"
all right?

25:36.680 --> 25:38.320
Somebody has to do
the gory shit around here,

25:38.320 --> 25:40.040
and it's gonna be me, okay?

25:41.240 --> 25:42.160
Okay.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.240
- Go and set the table.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.400
Oh!

26:14.400 --> 26:17.120
- Oh, fuck.

26:18.520 --> 26:20.000
- Oh, thank God.
- What the hell?

26:20.480 --> 26:21.400
Thank God.

26:21.400 --> 26:24.320
For a second there, I actually thought
I had properly done you in.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.480
That was really hard to judge

26:25.480 --> 26:27.840
because I had to hit you hard enough
to make it convincing,

26:27.840 --> 26:30.240
but, like, not so hard that you died.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.760
It looks like I fucking nailed it.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.520
Why am I on a bike, on a boat, Zoe?

26:37.520 --> 26:39.480
Because you have to go, Amelia, okay?

26:39.480 --> 26:41.720
There is a place out there
called Scuba City,

26:41.720 --> 26:43.320
and they can get you anything you need.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.720
So I need you to go out there
and get yourself some meds,

26:45.720 --> 26:47.640
and then come back home, please.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.760
You are so fucking annoying.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.200
- What?
- I was ready to go.

26:54.200 --> 26:55.160
I was at peace.

26:55.640 --> 26:58.960
And then you go out
and you do this fucking fake sacrifice

26:58.960 --> 27:00.600
and psycho boat escape,

27:00.600 --> 27:03.240
and, what, I'm just meant to come back
from all of that?

27:04.560 --> 27:05.560
Yes.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.720
Oh, my God, Zoe, you know what you are?

27:07.720 --> 27:11.360
You're like a, uh, uh...
Like a diagnosis, okay?

27:11.920 --> 27:16.200
When the doctor sits you down
and says this really annoying

27:16.760 --> 27:20.360
and sometimes life-threatening thing
is now a part of your life,

27:20.360 --> 27:22.320
so you're just gonna have
to learn to deal with it.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.720
Do you know how lucky we are, Amelia?

27:28.480 --> 27:32.440
You know how many people are out
there and they're just completely alone?

27:32.440 --> 27:35.360
People who would kill to have someone
who was a diagnosis

27:35.360 --> 27:39.520
because this thing, this thing
that you refuse to call friendship

27:39.520 --> 27:42.080
because, God forbid, ew, yucky,

27:42.080 --> 27:44.120
this is all either of us have left.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.000
So, yeah, sorry,
I'm always going to be here,

27:48.840 --> 27:51.960
pissing you off and whacking you
just the perfect amount

27:51.960 --> 27:53.800
so that you don't get fucking eaten,

27:53.800 --> 27:57.480
and telling you your fringe looks great
even though it looks... fine,

27:57.480 --> 28:00.120
because the difference between surviving

28:00.120 --> 28:02.880
and actually living up here

28:02.880 --> 28:06.600
is doing all the same shit,
but having somebody else to do it with.

28:07.360 --> 28:09.200
It's a fucking privilege, okay?

28:17.840 --> 28:19.680
I knew I couldn't pull off a fringe.

28:19.680 --> 28:21.920
- Oh, my God.
- Why'd you let me do that?

28:21.920 --> 28:23.960
Is that seriously
what you're regretting right now?

28:23.960 --> 28:26.840
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.880
This is good.
Regret means you're feeling something.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.840
I want to keep feeling things.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.760
Yeah. Good. Then just get up.

28:36.760 --> 28:38.880
Go, go, go! Don't think. Just go.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.400
Be safe.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.600
And come back, please.

28:53.480 --> 28:57.520
Well, I just think it's more tasteful
to have someone do the eulogy as we eat,

28:57.520 --> 28:59.480
so we can truly appreciate the sacrifice.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.000
It's not a theater restaurant, Genevieve.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.520
I'm not saying it's a theater restaurant.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.800
- It's an honoring of Amelia's life

29:04.800 --> 29:07.000
- and the sacrifice she's made for us.
-  Guys.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.800
That sounds a lot like
a theater restaurant to me.

29:08.800 --> 29:09.720
- Guys.
- It's not,

29:09.720 --> 29:11.520
it's just about appreciating what she did,

29:11.520 --> 29:13.960
her life, her hobbies, her...

29:13.960 --> 29:15.720
- friends and family...
- What are you gonna say?

29:15.720 --> 29:16.680
Guys.

29:16.680 --> 29:19.640
I'm gonna say, you know...

29:19.640 --> 29:21.040
Guys!

29:21.040 --> 29:23.840
<i>We have been listening to Zo-Zo FM.</i>

29:23.840 --> 29:26.920
<i>We can see what looks like a school.</i>

29:26.920 --> 29:29.360
<i>We've just passed... netball courts</i>

29:29.360 --> 29:32.120
<i>and, uh, could be a cliff face.</i>

29:32.120 --> 29:33.360
That's the west side.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.080
That's... That's boys.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.320
Hey! Wait up. Hey!

30:06.320 --> 30:08.760
Hi. I know we don't know each other,
but I'm freaking out

30:08.760 --> 30:10.960
because I think my forehead really smells,

30:10.960 --> 30:13.400
so can you, can you just smell it for me?

30:14.320 --> 30:15.760
Just, just smell it.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.040
<i>Sorry, that was really weird.</i>

30:18.040 --> 30:20.400
- I'm sorry. That was weird.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.240
Zoe, stop!

30:31.120 --> 30:32.480
Get on the boat!

30:32.480 --> 30:34.680
They'll kill you if you go back
without me.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.640
Oh, it's about freaking time.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.920
Been standing out here flapping
like a dick in the wind,

30:40.920 --> 30:43.160
waiting to see if you'd save me, too.

30:43.520 --> 30:46.760
Well, to be fair,
this boat is built for two people,

30:46.760 --> 30:49.160
so I can only go around in a circle.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.280
It's a fair point.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.680
Well, hurry up, dickhead.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.040
Sorry.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.000
Come on, Sister!

31:20.120 --> 31:21.240
Good day, girls.

31:21.840 --> 31:24.560
We've been looking for a place
to call home.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.400
And we're pretty hungry, so, uh...

31:29.080 --> 31:30.880
fire up the stove, ladies.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.200
What do you reckon?
Will you have us?

31:48.680 --> 31:51.120
Six lovely lads coming ashore!

31:58.840 --> 32:00.680
You know, your fringe
doesn't actually look that bad.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.080
Okay, we don't need to talk about it.

32:02.680 --> 32:03.520
You know what they say,

32:03.520 --> 32:06.720
it's only like a week between
a shit haircut and a good haircut.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.880
Yeah, well,
at the rate you're riding at,

32:07.880 --> 32:09.840
I'll be freaking Rapunzel
before we get anywhere.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.880
All right, then.
I've got little legs.

32:12.880 --> 32:15.200
Just keep riding, Zo-Zo.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.800
Keep riding.
