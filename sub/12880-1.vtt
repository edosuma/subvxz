00:16.550 --> 00:19.651
<i>Jimmy D here to make your
morning commute more enjoyable.</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:22.320
<i>Well, maybe not for one
unfortunate individual.</i>

00:22.355 --> 00:24.589
<i>I have a special guest in the
studio with me today.</i>

00:24.624 --> 00:27.092
<i>Say hello to the lovely Sarah.</i>

00:27.127 --> 00:29.494
<i>- [Sarah] Hi, Jimmy.
- Go ahead, Sarah.</i>

00:29.529 --> 00:33.198
<i>[Sarah] Last night,
he forgot our anniversary!</i>

00:33.233 --> 00:35.534
<i>Resulting in me waiting
for hours at some</i>

00:39.573 --> 00:42.374
<i>After he stood me up for the
last time, I went to the bar.</i>

00:42.409 --> 00:45.477
<i>There was
this really nice couple.</i>

00:45.512 --> 00:47.712
<i>- And we talked,</i>
<i>had some shots.</i>
<i>-</i> Sarah?

00:47.747 --> 00:51.183
<i>A lot of shots.
And they listened.</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:55.187
<i>So, I went home with them.</i>

00:55.222 --> 00:56.721
<i>[Jimmy] As in "home" home?</i>

00:56.756 --> 00:59.357
<i>- [Sarah] Home, home.
- [Jimmy] Damn!</i>

00:59.392 --> 01:01.560
<i>Now that's what you call a
French twist.</i>

01:01.595 --> 01:02.828
Sarah?

01:02.863 --> 01:04.529
<i>[Jimmy]
What's the poor sap's name?</i>

01:04.563 --> 01:07.699
<i>- [Sarah] Justin. Justin Davis.</i>
- What?!

01:07.734 --> 01:11.203
<i>[Jimmy]
Guys, don't be a Justin Davis.</i>

01:11.238 --> 01:13.538
<i>Be more mindful</i>
<i>of your commitments!</i>
<i>[chuckles]</i>

01:13.573 --> 01:14.873

- Morning.
- I'm fine.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.653
Thank you for calling
Cal-Telcom.

03:49.863 --> 03:51.296
Hi, Justin.

03:51.331 --> 03:56.001
Just for your information,
we got a lot of donuts in the
break room today.

03:56.036 --> 04:00.605
Okay. Um, thanks. I'm not really
in the mood for donuts today.

04:00.640 --> 04:04.676
Really?
Not even a french twist?

04:13.753 --> 04:16.788
[line ringing]

04:16.822 --> 04:19.690
<i>[Sarah] Leave a message</i>

04:19.726 --> 04:23.728
Hi, um, it's me.

04:23.763 --> 04:28.066
I'm trying so hard to not be
angry, but I just don't

04:28.101 --> 04:31.636
understand why you would want to
hurt me and humiliate me because

04:31.671 --> 04:34.906
I forgot one little thing...
fuck-- No.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.742
[office phone ringing]

04:43.783 --> 04:45.617
Thank you for calling
Cal-Telcom. This is Justin.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.719
- How may I--
- [man]
<i>My service is down again.</i>

04:48.755 --> 04:51.589
I'm sorry to hear you're having
trouble with your service.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.958
- If I can just--
- [man] <i> This is</i>
<i>the second time this month.</i>

04:53.993 --> 04:55.327
I understand, sir.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.762
<i>You know what?
I don't think you do.</i>

04:56.797 --> 04:59.731
<i>Otherwise we wouldn't be</i>
<i>talking to each other</i>
<i>right now, would we?</i>

04:59.766 --> 05:03.368
Alright, well, I can connect you
to a technical advisor who...

05:03.403 --> 05:07.672
Sir, I assure you that all of
our technicians have a high
school diploma or equivalency--

05:07.707 --> 05:10.408
[man] <i> And I'm going to be</i>
<i>charged for this, too, right?</i>
<i>You're gonna charge me?</i>

05:10.443 --> 05:11.843
I can work on waving the fee.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.978
<i>Work?! You do not know
the meaning of the word work.</i>

05:14.013 --> 05:16.681
<i>I'm a plumber. I deal with
people's shit all day</i>

05:16.716 --> 05:17.715
<i>and now
I'm dealing with yours.</i>

05:17.751 --> 05:20.985
<i>This is re-cock-ulous.
I am a paying customer.</i>

05:21.020 --> 05:23.755
Well, you know, if I can just
put you on hold for one moment.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.824
<i>Fix it. Just fix it.</i>
<i>I know you can do it</i>
<i>over the phone.</i>

05:25.859 --> 05:27.726
<i>Just push a little button.
Come on. Do it.</i>

05:27.761 --> 05:28.794
You know what, sir,
you know what?

05:28.829 --> 05:31.730
I'm having, like, the worst
morning right now. Okay?

05:31.765 --> 05:33.498
And, and, honestly,
I agree with you.

05:33.533 --> 05:36.868
I agree the system's flawed, but
right now I'm, I'm, asking you,

05:36.903 --> 05:39.437
I'm begging you to just be nice.
Please?

05:39.472 --> 05:40.605
I just need someone
to be nice to me.

05:40.640 --> 05:43.541
It sucks, but you didn't
purchase the insurance policy

05:43.576 --> 05:47.145
- and only an idiot would not
insur... buy...
<i>- Idiot...? Are you fuck...</i>

05:47.180 --> 05:49.881
<i>I hope you have health</i>
<i>insurance cause I'm coming down</i>
<i>there to fuck your face.</i>

05:49.916 --> 05:52.951
Alright, thank you for calling
Cal-Telcom and I'll be sure to
say hi to Satan for you.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.122
What's up, Justin?

05:58.157 --> 06:00.525
Really? You have to eat that
right in front of my face?

06:00.560 --> 06:02.794
- Why do you look so mad?
- You didn't hear what happened?

06:02.829 --> 06:05.463
Don't you listen to
<i>Jimmy D in the Morning?</i>

06:05.498 --> 06:07.832
Jimmy D? He's like
a cheap man's Howard Stern.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.468
Sarah broke up with me
on <i> Jimmy D in the Morning.</i>

06:10.503 --> 06:14.873
Oh my goodness.
You guys were so happy.

06:14.908 --> 06:15.940
I thought so.

06:15.975 --> 06:17.475
[sighs]

06:17.510 --> 06:19.444
Last night,
there was this woman--

06:19.479 --> 06:21.746
What? You had an affair?
Well, that's not very adult.

06:21.781 --> 06:23.848
No, I did not
have an affair, alright?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.451
A woman customer, her name was
Carol, she was having trouble

06:26.486 --> 06:27.986
with her service
and she owns a small business.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.555
Doesn't everyone now days?
[laughs]

06:30.590 --> 06:33.691
I stayed to help her through
the entire reboot process

06:33.726 --> 06:35.960
and that threw me for a loop
and by the end I was exhausted,

06:35.995 --> 06:40.432
so I went straight home
and I... I forgot
our anniversary.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.933
Oh. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

06:41.968 --> 06:44.602
You forgot the anniversary.
No good.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.671
That's exactly
what Jimmy D said.

06:46.706 --> 06:49.908
And then, she tells him
about this whole fuckin
French twist thing

06:49.943 --> 06:52.777
and stupid Earl shows up
and just tries to humiliate me.

06:52.812 --> 06:55.547
- He's... a douche.
- I know.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.615
- I was going to marry her.
- You were?!

06:57.650 --> 06:59.250
Yeah, of course. I...

06:59.285 --> 07:02.787
I mean, I was just waiting for
a promotion or at least more
financial security.

07:02.822 --> 07:05.223
But I'd been looking at
engagement rings online.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.892
Oh, I feel bad for you.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.830
Really? You, too!
Honestly, it's not funny.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.866
Justin got dumped on <i> Jimmy D</i>
<i>in the Morning</i> this morning.

07:14.901 --> 07:17.202
- Sammy!
- What?

07:17.237 --> 07:18.837
[mouth full] I-I had no idea.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.539
I just thought that maybe
you wanted a donut?

07:21.574 --> 07:24.876
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
- It was pretty bad.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.244
You guys were
together a long time, right?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.179
Five years.
That's a long time.

07:28.214 --> 07:29.981
At least you weren't married.

07:30.016 --> 07:33.551
- Or kids and...
- Yeah, alimony?

07:33.586 --> 07:35.920
That involves money.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.989
That's why the word is ali-mony.

07:38.024 --> 07:41.226
Cause "mony" I think
is the root word for money.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.729
[phone ringing]

07:44.764 --> 07:46.931
[Southern accent]
Cal-Telcom, this is Peggy Sue.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.801
Alabama. Where are you from?

07:49.836 --> 07:52.270
[gasps]
Coffee kicked in.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.905
I gotta make.

08:00.246 --> 08:02.280
Dammit, that's delicious.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.848
Can you hear me? Hello?

08:03.883 --> 08:06.751
Hey, um, this thing it just
isn't working again.

08:06.786 --> 08:09.153
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- It was fine a minute ago.
I don't know what happened.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.589
Yeah, the wireless
tend to be a bit squirrely.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.725
I'll figure out
what the problem is.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.694
Okay.
There you go.

08:16.729 --> 08:18.596
The plug was loose.
It should work now.

08:18.631 --> 08:20.031
Here you go.
Found that in there, too.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.033
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.

08:22.068 --> 08:25.937
- You're a lifesaver.
- Oh. I am not.
[chuckles]

08:25.972 --> 08:29.707
- Maybe if I worked at, like,
a suicide hotline and then...
- Yeah.

08:29.742 --> 08:33.945
...literally, would be
a lifesaver, if you know,
I was good at my job.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.614
Um, which I think, I hope,
I would...

08:36.649 --> 08:38.816
- He's handsome.
- Yeah? You think?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.183
This was our anniversary.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.921
A special occasion, you know?

08:42.956 --> 08:45.123
Real important.
I'll see you later.

08:45.158 --> 08:48.159
Thanks for the... for this.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.601
You're a dummy.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.303
How'd you forget your
anniversary?

08:58.338 --> 08:59.904
Who forgets their anniversary?

08:59.939 --> 09:03.241
You... you don't deserve Sarah.
You don't.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.375
That's why she did that.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.278
Cause you didn't deserve her
and you treated her bad

09:07.313 --> 09:09.981
and she left you for two peo...
[crying gasps]

09:11.751 --> 09:14.085
You're gonna be alone!

09:14.120 --> 09:16.087
[crying gasps]

09:16.122 --> 09:17.922
You're gonna be alone!

09:17.957 --> 09:20.926
You... to be alone!

09:22.061 --> 09:24.195
You're gonna be alone
your whole life!

09:24.230 --> 09:28.066
You dummy!
You dummy.

09:28.101 --> 09:29.501
- [man] My god.
- [sniffles] Sammy.

09:29.536 --> 09:33.605
[Sammy] Listen, man, you know,
maybe you should try dating
online?

09:33.640 --> 09:34.872
Louis does it.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.774
Louis?
Louis from the mail room Louis?

09:36.809 --> 09:38.810
Hm. He's had
a lot of success with it.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.778
I don't think I'm going to be
dating anytime soon

09:40.813 --> 09:42.213
and definitely not online.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.916
[Sammy] It's not really dating.
It's casual.

09:44.951 --> 09:45.984
[fart noise]

09:46.019 --> 09:47.619
Oh, sneak attack.

09:51.958 --> 09:54.325
Have a good day. Thank you
for calling Cal-Telcom.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.060
[phone rings]

09:56.095 --> 09:57.762
You should talk to him.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.230
How long have you been
standing there?

09:59.265 --> 10:04.135
You know,
you might not realize this,
but Louis is a very wise man.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.002
I'm not going to talk to Louis.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.205
He has so many insightful
things to say.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.273
Don't care.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.308
It will take your mind off of
her for a few minutes.

10:11.678 --> 10:12.777
Come on, peach pie.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.316
[man] He looks deeply in her
eyes as his hand moves up

10:18.351 --> 10:22.687
her silky skirt to her
throbbing pleasure pocket.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.757
She breathes heavily
with anticipation,

10:25.792 --> 10:30.395
"Take me now, Javier.
Take me now!"

10:30.430 --> 10:35.366
A sensation that moves
into a howl...

10:35.401 --> 10:39.137
[sexual grunting]

10:40.039 --> 10:43.141
Whoo... fellas.

10:44.043 --> 10:46.177
Louis, hey.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.080
Uh, that was... a thing.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.149
I did not realize you
are a writer.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.385
Not writer.
Romance orator.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.754
I channel pure desire.

10:56.789 --> 10:57.922
Just let it free flow.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.992
It's really impressive.
You know, Louis gave me a CD.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.360
I fall asleep to it every night.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.263
Crazy wet dreams.
I wake up crusty.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.432
Yeah,
it's quite effective.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.367
Here you go.
First one's free.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.070
Oh, thanks.
Can't wait to check it out.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.772
Where are my manners?

11:14.807 --> 11:16.374
Can I get you two something?

11:16.409 --> 11:18.143
Cappuccino perhaps?

11:18.978 --> 11:20.211
Yes. Yes.

11:20.246 --> 11:22.213
A cappuccino would be nice.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.848
- [classical music plays]
- Mmmm.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.119
Our friend Justin has hit a bit
of a rough patch.

11:28.154 --> 11:31.322
His long time girlfriend...
[laughs]

11:31.357 --> 11:35.059
I'm sorry, his long time
girlfriend broke up with...

11:35.094 --> 11:40.131
[laughs] ...broke up with him
this morning, this morning,

11:40.166 --> 11:43.435
over the rad...
[laughs]

11:44.337 --> 11:46.771
Over the radio.
I'm so sorry.

11:46.806 --> 11:47.872
Over the radio.

11:47.907 --> 11:50.374
God, don't even,
I'm just, I'm terrible.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.211
- Justin, you care to comment?
- Not really.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.079
Please.
You're safe here.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.280
Fine.

11:56.315 --> 11:59.317
Uh, I got caught up at work,
I forgot my anniversary dinner,

11:59.352 --> 12:01.920
and my girlfriend cheated on me
two times at once.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.423
And now you wanna get
back at her?

12:05.458 --> 12:06.290
What? No.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.427
But you wanna have
a threesome with her?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.062
[Justin] No.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.364
I'm sorry.
What are we doing here?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.565
I don't want to be here.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.168
- I... Sammy--
- I was telling Justin
about internet dating.

12:17.203 --> 12:20.505
- Ahh...
- Guys, I was dumped
less than eight hours ago.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.774
The last thing
on my mind right now is dating.

12:22.809 --> 12:26.177
Not dating.
Experiencing.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.813
Okay.
Well, that sounds worse.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.782
- So...
- He's not ready.

12:30.817 --> 12:31.583
He is.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.117
No, I think
for once Louis is right.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.852
- I am not ready.
- You know what?

12:34.887 --> 12:38.055
Maybe you should try
a phone sex hotline?

12:38.090 --> 12:40.057
- Oh, of course.
- No! Not of course.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.526
I'm not going to do
a phone sex hotline!

12:41.561 --> 12:44.195
You need to flush that bitch
out of your system.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.863
Flush her out!

12:45.898 --> 12:47.198
The only way
to do that is to hookup.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.133
I'm not a hook-up guy.
I'm not.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.169
I-I'm a relationship guy.

12:51.204 --> 12:56.307
Justin, in your adult life,
have you ever not been
in a relationship?

12:59.278 --> 13:00.311
No.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.547
So how do you know
that you're not a hook-up guy?

13:02.582 --> 13:04.882
Thank you.
You see he's wise.

13:04.917 --> 13:09.487
Online dating is...
it's gonna open your mind

13:09.522 --> 13:13.357
to possibilities
you could never imagine.

13:13.392 --> 13:16.361
It's an ice cream shop.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.229
I'm sorry?

13:18.264 --> 13:22.300
The entire dating community
at your fingertips.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.336
I was telling Justin about
Casual Encounters.

13:25.371 --> 13:28.406
My preferred site as well.
You know what, Justin,
I'm going to set you up.

13:28.441 --> 13:32.276
Well, I like that it's casual,
but I...

13:32.311 --> 13:34.278
Look I appreciate
what you're doing.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.214
I just don't think now
is the right time.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.517
The sooner you start,
the sooner you grow.

13:42.221 --> 13:45.122
So this threesome?
Was it two cocks?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.191
I'm not sure.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.459
[knock on door]

13:52.298 --> 13:53.298
Hi!

13:59.405 --> 14:02.139
I'm sorry. I didn't want this
to start like that.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.442
I said I should come get my
stuff when you weren't here.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.312
Yeah, well, I was just worried
that you were going to

14:08.347 --> 14:10.414
sleep with my couch
and TV at the same time,

14:10.449 --> 14:11.482
so I couldn't risk it.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.583
That doesn't make sense.

14:12.618 --> 14:15.586
None of this makes sense, Sarah!
How could you do this?

14:15.621 --> 14:19.223
You cheat on me? And you ruin
my favorite radio program
because I forget a dinner?

14:19.258 --> 14:23.127
It wasn't a dinner, Justin!
It was our anniversary.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.528
And a lot of others, too.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.231
My birthday.
My grandmother's funeral.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.133
The Clean the Bay Charity Walk?

14:29.168 --> 14:31.269
- That one I forgot on purpose.
- Don't be petty.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.337
I'm not.
It was early as shit.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.406
So, what? You're gonna
throw away everything we had?

14:35.441 --> 14:36.908
We've been stuck.

14:36.943 --> 14:40.111
I can't remember
the last time I felt excited.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.345
Can you?

14:41.380 --> 14:44.582
It'll be good.
For the both of us.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.417
We can finally be happy.

14:46.452 --> 14:49.587
I didn't want to be happy.
I wanted to be with you!

14:49.622 --> 14:51.956
Think about that.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.393
- Goodbye, Justin.
- Yeah.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.441
[woman on phone]
<i>Hello, Justin.</i>

15:10.476 --> 15:13.444
- Hi.
<i>- Hm. I like that name. Justin.</i>

15:13.479 --> 15:16.380
Oh, thank you.
Uh, what's your name?

15:16.415 --> 15:18.716
<i>Barbie. Like the doll,
but bigger boobs.</i>

15:18.751 --> 15:20.151
Oh.
[chuckles]

15:20.186 --> 15:21.219
<i>You know what I heard?</i>

15:21.254 --> 15:23.721
<i>- Justin's have thick cocks--</i>
- [phone buzzes]

15:23.756 --> 15:25.256
No, not...

15:30.162 --> 15:32.663
I had a girlfriend, Barbie,

15:32.698 --> 15:36.067
- until recently and--
<i>- Did you screw her best friend?</i>

15:36.102 --> 15:38.536
No. I can be kinda forgetful.

15:38.571 --> 15:42.306
And and I forgot
one too many things.

15:42.341 --> 15:46.744
Now I am just feeling kinda
lonely, and, uh, worthless

15:46.779 --> 15:52.249
and stressed, you know,
I have a gross eczema rash
on my hand

15:52.284 --> 15:54.385
and I've just never
had anything like it.

15:54.420 --> 15:57.655
It just broke out and I'm a
little worried that if I go see
a doctor,

15:57.690 --> 16:03.060
it's going to cost a lot,
because the medical coverage
at my work, Barbie, is terrible.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.396
It's awful.
It's an 80/20 copay.

16:05.431 --> 16:08.466
That means I have to pay
80 and they pay 20 percent
and they--

16:08.501 --> 16:11.502
<i>Bet you got a big old
donkey dick, don't you, Justin?</i>

16:12.338 --> 16:14.472
Geez, Barbie.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.440
Barbie,
have you ever been dumped?

16:16.475 --> 16:19.343
<i>I've been dumped on,
fecally speaking.</i>

16:19.378 --> 16:21.645
[groans] Yeah, that doesn't
really do it for me.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.448
<i>Well, tell me what does do
it for you, donkey dick?</i>

16:24.483 --> 16:27.051
Um, a girl who
won't cheat on you?

16:27.086 --> 16:32.056
A girl who won't have a
ménage-a-trios or anything
French for that matter.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.557
I mean, I can't believe that she
would do that.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.493
<i>It's just makes me sad.</i>

16:35.528 --> 16:40.698
<i>A well-endowed horse dick guy
like you, you deserve better.</i>

16:40.733 --> 16:43.034
That's very nice of you, Barbie.

16:43.069 --> 16:46.437
You're very good at your job,
but I'm, I'm not a horse dick.

16:46.472 --> 16:51.542
I am a very average sized
ani... I'm goat dick at best.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.812
<i>Well, then maybe subconsciously
you knew she wasn't the one,</i>

16:54.847 --> 16:57.482
<i>so that's why
you would forget things.</i>

16:58.851 --> 17:00.518
Huh.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.489
Yeah, ah, wow.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.258
[phones ringing]

17:07.760 --> 17:09.727
[mouse clicks]

17:17.569 --> 17:20.070
[woman]
Ooo. Narcissist much?

17:20.106 --> 17:21.405
Oh, I guess.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.407
That's... it's not...
No, no, no, not at all,

17:24.443 --> 17:26.410
I... that's for, um, I'm
doing it cause of a...

17:26.444 --> 17:29.447
- It's a stupid thing.
- If you want, like,

17:29.482 --> 17:30.515
an actual photo
where you don't have to actually

17:30.550 --> 17:34.185
crop out your ex,
I moonlight as a photographer.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.586
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:35.621 --> 17:38.422
I prefer dance photography,
but I could photograph you.

17:38.457 --> 17:41.425
Oh that's, that's...
I would not ask you
to waste your talents on me.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.560
No, it wouldn't be wasting.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.595
I mean, you could,
like, bust a move.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.530
I'm not, ah,
what you would call a mover.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.566
I could do normal
portraits as well.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.568
That's very nice.
I will let you know.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.470
- Thank you. If it... Yeah.
- Alright.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.539
Okay. Bye.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.375
Where were you last night?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.743
- Nowhere.
- I tried calling you.

17:59.778 --> 18:00.844
- Really?
- Really?

18:00.879 --> 18:04.715
I was talking to Julio
from maintenance the other day,

18:04.750 --> 18:07.418
and as I am talking to him,
I'm thinking to myself:

18:07.453 --> 18:10.855
"Boy, I could really use
a burrito right now."

18:10.890 --> 18:12.656
You think that's racist?

18:12.691 --> 18:13.691
Yes.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.227
Well, I guess
I'm a hungry racist.

18:16.262 --> 18:19.497
You know, I am going to ask Earl
if we can throw an office party

18:19.532 --> 18:21.565
for, you know, rally the troops.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.536
I'm all for it. I just don't
know how much of
a party guy Earl is?

18:25.571 --> 18:27.304
I saw your profile picture.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.573
- Already?
- And it wasn't very impressive.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.542
Well, now, I wish Louis
had not sent that to you.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.144
- Look at this.
- No, I've seen the picture.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.478
You know what that's called?
That's called monkey mouth.

18:34.513 --> 18:35.646
It's my mouth.

18:35.681 --> 18:36.981
If I'm a chick
and I'm looking at this,

18:37.016 --> 18:40.518
I'm thinking,
"That guy definitely has
a severe case of halitosis."

18:40.553 --> 18:42.186
Well, when you zoom in
like that...

18:42.221 --> 18:43.420
- That's not my Justin.
- It's temporary, alright?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.623
- We'll use it for right now.
- That's not my baby Justin.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.825
Yes, okay,
we'll use it just temporarily

18:47.860 --> 18:52.630
and if it gets a bad reaction,
um, actually Laura offered
to take my picture.

18:52.665 --> 18:53.631
- Did she?
- Yeah.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.399
- She's nice, huh?
- Uh, yes.

18:55.434 --> 18:56.734
You know she can clean herself
like a cat?

18:56.769 --> 18:58.636
I'm sor... I beg your pardon?

18:58.671 --> 19:00.604
One day I walk in,
early morning,

19:00.639 --> 19:03.607
and I seen her licking
her own collarbone.
Like a cat.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.942
No, I don't think
that's a real thing.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.744
You know, and I've tried.
It's impossible.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.514
- I'm gonna go get a soda.
- You have to be superhuman.

19:10.516 --> 19:11.482
Did you know that you're

19:11.517 --> 19:12.950
more likely to die in a
vending machine accident

19:12.985 --> 19:14.785
than be attacked by a shark?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.386
- Is that true?
- Mm-hm.

19:16.422 --> 19:20.457
Yup, like two to three people
every year die in a vending
machine accident,

19:20.492 --> 19:23.627
it's like
one in 112,000,000, right?

19:23.662 --> 19:29.567
Whereas, like,
I think one in 251,800,000

19:29.602 --> 19:32.636
die in shark attack every year,
so that means that you're more
than twice as likely

19:32.671 --> 19:36.373
to actually die from a
vending machine accident
than to be eaten by a shark.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.943
Which is really funny, because
people are terrified of sharks

19:38.978 --> 19:42.713
and have really no reasonable
fear of vending machines
whatsoever.

19:42.748 --> 19:44.281
- That's a good point.
- Yeah.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.215
That's a really good point.

19:45.251 --> 19:46.717
I mean that's probably
how they kill you.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.453
They... they lull you into
a false sense of security

19:49.488 --> 19:50.988
and that's when
they just pounce.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.656
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.692
- Tricky devils.
- Wow.

20:03.802 --> 20:06.204
This was a mistake.

20:08.707 --> 20:09.707
Hm.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.209
Oh, boy.

20:11.777 --> 20:13.911
No. No. No. No!

20:13.946 --> 20:16.747
Did I not put
specifications in here?

20:16.782 --> 20:19.683
Cat lady. Cat lady. Cat lady.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.285
Puppy.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.554
[music plays]

20:47.346 --> 20:48.812
- Justin!
- Oh, God.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.315
Come here, loverboy.

20:51.350 --> 20:53.317
Hey, Louis.
How's it going, man?

20:53.352 --> 20:55.853
I am so glad to see you.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.354
Good to see you, Louis.

20:57.389 --> 20:58.422
[giggles]

20:58.457 --> 21:00.958
Justin, meet Pamela,
my lady friend for the evening.

21:00.993 --> 21:04.962
- She is the best.
- [laughter]

21:04.997 --> 21:06.397
What are you drinking?

21:06.432 --> 21:07.898
Oh, no. No.
I got it.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.333
Please. I insist.

21:09.368 --> 21:12.336
Vodka and, ah, vodka.

21:12.371 --> 21:16.640
Sir, a shot of your finest vodka
for my friend, please.

21:16.675 --> 21:17.775
Kalashnikov is fine.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.777
Isn't that
a type of machine gun?

21:19.812 --> 21:20.978
[laughing]

21:21.013 --> 21:24.648
Yeah, it is.
It's also a cheap vodka.

21:24.683 --> 21:27.318
Oh, here we are.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.820
To the unbridled dance.

21:29.855 --> 21:33.390
May it always
be forever rhythmic.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.993
In the eyes.
Or seven years bad sex.

21:43.435 --> 21:46.437
So all you have to do
is be yourself,

21:46.472 --> 21:50.374
just a confident, secure,
sexual version of yourself.

21:50.409 --> 21:53.044
Oh, is that all? [chuckles]
Piece of cake!

21:53.912 --> 21:55.646
Nice to meet you, Pamela.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.814
See you later.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.750
Hi. Are you Heidi?

21:59.785 --> 22:03.521
- No, I'm not Heidi.
- Sorry to bother you.

22:16.935 --> 22:18.536
Hi!

22:18.971 --> 22:20.838
- Hi?
- I'm Heidi.

22:20.873 --> 22:21.939
You're what?

22:21.974 --> 22:24.408
You're waiting to meet a
woman named Heidi, aren't you?

22:24.443 --> 22:26.110
You're Justin?

22:26.145 --> 22:28.078
Um, I, ah...

22:28.113 --> 22:30.647
These are from the gentleman
from the bar.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.783
[Heidi]
Thank the gentleman at he bar.

22:32.818 --> 22:35.552
Vodka is my drink of choice.
Cheers!

22:35.587 --> 22:38.822
No, ah, I'm... I'm sorry,
I think there's a mix-up.

22:38.857 --> 22:43.093
I'm waiting for a Heidi,
but this is the Heidi
I am waiting for.

22:43.128 --> 22:47.898
You've been talking to me
online, but that picture
is of my little sister.

22:47.933 --> 22:50.501
I just don't know why
you used her picture--

22:50.536 --> 22:52.469
You were so nice online,
and for one night,

22:52.504 --> 22:54.772
I just wanted to see what
it was like to walk in her shoes

22:54.807 --> 22:58.742
and have dinner with
a handsome guy like yourself.

22:58.777 --> 23:00.778
Handsome is a strong word.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.447
Your profile picture
does not do you justice.

23:03.482 --> 23:07.918
Now that I am seeing you
in person... meow.

23:07.953 --> 23:10.587
Okay. Can I ask
you something? Personal?

23:10.622 --> 23:11.521
You can ask me anything.

23:11.557 --> 23:15.058
Um, what, um,
what happened to your arm?

23:15.093 --> 23:18.896
Oh, uh, it was a vending
machine accident.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.030
Sure, sure. That's fine.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.866
You know what, actually
I think this was a mistake.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.069
Um, the trust
has kind of been broken.

23:26.104 --> 23:27.838
[sigh] It's just it's
really hard.

23:27.873 --> 23:30.774
I'm sorry that I lied to you,
but I get a lot of nub seekers.

23:30.809 --> 23:31.875
Nub seekers?

23:31.910 --> 23:34.778
Acrotomophiliacs, like people
obsessed with amputees.

23:34.813 --> 23:37.448
It's like a weird fetish.

23:37.483 --> 23:38.783
Here you go.

23:39.685 --> 23:40.985
Thank you.

23:43.789 --> 23:47.958
The last time that I went out
to a restaurant like this,

23:47.993 --> 23:52.797
my boyfriend broke up with me
and I thought that
he was going to propose.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.899
- [Heidi crying]
- Oh...

23:55.934 --> 23:57.501
[crying gasp]

23:57.536 --> 24:00.237
Alright... There, there, there.
There, there.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.907
Actually, Heidi, you know what,
I kind of understand what you're
going through.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.911
I myself am experiencing
something similar right now.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.914
- You are?
- Do you want to know?

24:12.150 --> 24:18.188
Um, a couple of mornings ago,
I woke up to my girlfriend

24:18.223 --> 24:22.159
on national radio saying
she was going to dump me

24:22.194 --> 24:24.928
and that she had a threeway
with complete strangers.

24:24.963 --> 24:25.963
So...

24:25.998 --> 24:27.164
Oh, my God.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.031
Mm-hm.

24:28.067 --> 24:31.735
You're the Justin
from the Jimmy D show?

24:31.770 --> 24:32.869
Oh you heard it?!

24:32.905 --> 24:36.773
Heartless... to have a threeway
with a couple strangers

24:36.808 --> 24:38.709
and then brag about it
on national radio?

24:38.744 --> 24:40.177
- Right?
- She used your last name.

24:40.212 --> 24:41.745
That's a security issue!

24:41.780 --> 24:45.148
- Any woman would be
lucky to have you.
- Nah...

24:45.183 --> 24:47.584
I know you don't care
what I think

24:47.619 --> 24:50.153
cause I just lied to you
and I fuckin suck for that,

24:50.188 --> 24:52.589
but if I was
good enough for you...

24:52.624 --> 24:53.857
You're not... you are good.

24:53.892 --> 24:56.527
I don't deserve to be happy

24:56.562 --> 24:58.529
and I shouldn't
have wasted your time.

24:58.564 --> 25:01.131
- And I'm really sorry.
- No... Heidi...

25:02.034 --> 25:03.601
Heidi, listen to me.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.737
You do deserve to be happy.

25:08.807 --> 25:10.174
[moaning]

25:11.910 --> 25:13.877
Sorry. Not quite.

25:13.912 --> 25:15.478
- Yeah...
- Still not it.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.715
- Feels like you're trying to
put wet Play-Doh inside of me.
- Just give me a sec.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.751
- This is--
- I know, that's my fault.

25:20.786 --> 25:24.054
- Does this help?
- No, that really
doesn't do anything.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.623
Um, you know what?

25:26.658 --> 25:28.158
Maybe we shouldn't do this,
right?

25:28.193 --> 25:32.963
I mean, I've had a nice night,
but I think we're doing it
for the wrong reasons.

25:32.998 --> 25:34.631
We're both pretty vulnerable.

25:34.666 --> 25:36.934
We both just got out of long
relationships.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.636
I hear what you're saying.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.138
And...

25:41.173 --> 25:42.873
[groaning]

25:42.908 --> 25:44.575
[speaks indistinct]

25:44.610 --> 25:46.209
- Oh, my God.
- Does this make you
feel comfortable?

25:46.244 --> 25:47.911
- You comfortable now?
- Oh, yeah.

25:47.946 --> 25:49.780
Uh-huh.
Oh, my God.

25:49.815 --> 25:50.981
- Meow!
- Oh, my God!

25:51.016 --> 25:52.716
- Like you mean it!
- Oh, wait!

25:52.751 --> 25:53.884
Oh you want me to meow?
Actual meow?

25:53.919 --> 25:55.619
Meow! Meow!

25:55.654 --> 25:56.820
Oh, my God.

25:56.855 --> 25:58.055
[moaning]

25:58.090 --> 26:00.057
Meow!

26:00.892 --> 26:03.994
[screaming]

26:08.300 --> 26:09.633
[computer clicking]

26:23.015 --> 26:24.315
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:24.350 --> 26:28.085
Um, so Sammy and I are
going to go to the bar
and grab some drinks,

26:28.120 --> 26:29.820
if you would like to join us.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.722
Yeah, uh, I am tempted. Yeah.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.690
So yeah.
Maybe we'll see you there.

26:33.725 --> 26:34.959
- Yeah.
- Okay.

26:39.064 --> 26:40.965
[rock music plays]

26:55.947 --> 26:58.215
Louis, ah,
told me about your hot date.

26:58.250 --> 27:02.719
I didn't realize
you were into the fats.

27:02.754 --> 27:04.354
Alright, she was a woman.
That--

27:04.389 --> 27:07.157
And fat women are, like,
they really, they really
go for it, like--

27:07.192 --> 27:08.091
Just a person.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.826
They use their heart
when they're having sex.

27:09.861 --> 27:10.994
I don't know.
I don't generalize.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.162
You took her to pound town?

27:12.197 --> 27:14.031
Pound town?
That's not a real place.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.399
- How did it feel?
- How did what feel?

27:15.434 --> 27:17.801
- Did it feel fat?
- Did it feel fat?

27:17.836 --> 27:19.336
That's terrible. I'm not
going to acknowledge that.

27:19.371 --> 27:20.871
Was it good?

27:21.306 --> 27:23.106
You know what? It was.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.340
It was, it was really nice.

27:24.376 --> 27:28.345
I, you know, it was different,
but it was, it was, pretty good.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.080
Did you wear a condom?

27:30.115 --> 27:32.149
How is that any of your
business?

27:32.184 --> 27:33.117
It's a small town, brother.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.951
You don't want
what I'm putting out there,

27:34.986 --> 27:37.087
and I don't want
you're putting out there.

27:37.122 --> 27:38.121
Not that small a town.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.057
So you don't need
to worry about it,

27:40.092 --> 27:42.225
but yes of course,
I wore a condom.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.127
I wear three.

27:44.162 --> 27:47.898
It desensitizes me so that
I don't ejaculate prematurely.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.399
You know
that's actually dangerous.

27:49.435 --> 27:52.035
They say the more condoms
you wear the higher risk
there is of them breaking.

27:52.070 --> 27:55.205
- Old wives tale.
- No, that's just a fact.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.039
- That's a fact.
- Laura...

27:56.074 --> 27:57.307
- No don't, don't ask her--
- Yes?

27:57.342 --> 27:58.675
- Come here.
- What?

27:58.710 --> 28:04.414
Is it true that if you
use multiple condoms,
say three condoms,

28:04.449 --> 28:08.118
it increases the friction
which in turn increases
the risk of breakage?

28:08.153 --> 28:10.053
Condoms...

28:10.088 --> 28:12.189
- Who needs them?
- [chuckles] Listen to this one!

28:12.224 --> 28:15.892
I get enough rubber up my vagina
with my yearly visit
with Dr. Karen, so...

28:15.927 --> 28:16.927
Excuse me.

28:16.962 --> 28:17.928
[laughing]

28:17.963 --> 28:18.929
Whoa!

28:18.964 --> 28:20.097
Justin, you look really
uncomfortable right now.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.966
- I am! Yeah.
- Hey!

28:23.001 --> 28:24.501
Don Julio!

28:24.536 --> 28:27.304
You know what? I've had my limit
of two drinks, so I'm good.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.406
- Uno mas!
- Everybody's doing it.

28:29.441 --> 28:32.242
- Everybody's doing it, Laura.
- Okay, well, in that case.

28:32.277 --> 28:35.412
Okay, the job is shit,
but the people are not.

28:35.447 --> 28:39.349
Except for Earl,
that motherfucker!

28:39.384 --> 28:41.118
To good company!

28:45.056 --> 28:46.189
Wooooo!

28:46.224 --> 28:48.358
[chuckles]
I like to scream in public.

28:48.393 --> 28:51.261
Okay. I'm going to go
punch Chantal in the back.

28:51.296 --> 28:54.431
I should get out of here
before I pass out.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.500
Oh, yeah.
How are you gonna get home?

28:56.535 --> 28:58.068
I'm probably
just going to cab it.

28:58.103 --> 28:59.836
Actually, um,
I'd be happy to drive you.

28:59.871 --> 29:03.073
I'm going to take off soon, too,
and I'm good to drive cause

29:03.108 --> 29:06.543
I actually have a very high
alcohol tolerance.

29:06.578 --> 29:10.046
No, I feel like soon enough
I'm going to be
pretty inebriated

29:10.081 --> 29:11.915
and I would prefer you
not see me that way.

29:11.950 --> 29:15.819
No judgment.
I am merely a chauffeur.

29:15.854 --> 29:17.053
Door to door service.

29:17.089 --> 29:19.956
Even if I'm like spewing stuff
left and right and I can't even

29:19.991 --> 29:21.424
form a complete sentence?

29:21.459 --> 29:24.161
Well, see, now I have to take
you, cause that sounds hilarious

29:24.196 --> 29:25.195
and there's no way
I'm missing out on that.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.130
- Okay.
- Do you want me
to take you home?

29:27.165 --> 29:28.165
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.767
Let me get my stuff.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.872
So, how did you get started
at Cal-Telcom?

29:35.907 --> 29:38.041
Um, I--

29:38.076 --> 29:41.144
You know, how about I answer
for you and you answer for me?

29:41.179 --> 29:43.246
- Okay, sure.
- Okay.

29:43.281 --> 29:47.984
Hi, I'm Justin Davis,
and I work at Cal-Telcom.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.487
- I'm an old soothsayer?
- It's weird. It's weird.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.155
I'm so sorry.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.022
No, it's nice to hear
my voice back to me

29:53.058 --> 29:54.090
cause I don't know
what I sound like.

29:54.126 --> 29:56.159
- It's exactly how you sound.
- It is? Perfect.

29:56.194 --> 30:00.063
It was the first job interview
I got out of college, okay.

30:00.098 --> 30:05.235
Student loans rang
and all add up and someone's
gotta pay the bills.

30:05.270 --> 30:06.603
Decent hours, right?

30:06.638 --> 30:10.307
Make enough money to take a lady
out on a date every once in a
while,

30:10.342 --> 30:12.175
when I don't forget.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.244
- Oh, come on. Low blow.
- Nice dig.

30:14.279 --> 30:17.581
After a few years
of pay period living,

30:17.616 --> 30:20.016
I figured why did I get
my business degree?

30:20.051 --> 30:23.887
And why am I still paying for
an education that
I'm not even using?

30:23.922 --> 30:26.489
However, there still is
assistant manager!

30:26.524 --> 30:29.593
- What's wrong with management?
- Nothing.

30:29.628 --> 30:31.628
Okay. My turn.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.998
I'm Laura Leonard.
I work at Cal-Telcom.

30:35.033 --> 30:39.236
It was just supposed to be
temporary to supplement
photography, my true passion,

30:39.271 --> 30:44.975
but weeks turned into months
and pretty soon the concept of

30:45.010 --> 30:48.879
"Don't quit your day job"
began to mentally fester inside.

30:48.914 --> 30:52.182
Sorry, I cannot be blamed
for expensive film!

30:52.217 --> 30:53.884
Why don't you
just switch to digital?

30:53.919 --> 30:57.487
No, because dance is so much
more beautiful on film.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.389
I get it.
It's nostalgic, too.

30:59.424 --> 31:00.958
Yeah.

31:01.993 --> 31:04.361
I am feeling totally buzzed.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.263
I am the biggest lightweight
on the planet.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.965
Yeah. Well, that's good.
You're a cheap date.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.001
- Do not call me cheap.
- No.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.602
Oh, I didn't mean
that you were cheap. I'm sorry.

31:12.638 --> 31:17.040
No, I was saying just cause you
wouldn't have to buy a lot of
beers and save on...

31:18.343 --> 31:20.043
I'm totally messing with you.

31:20.078 --> 31:21.278
Okay. Alright.

31:21.313 --> 31:22.679
- Yes.
- Oh, hang on, hang on.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.247
Pull over, pull over,
pull over, pull over.

31:24.282 --> 31:26.349
Oh, shit. You're gonna vomit.
Hold on, okay.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.985
[music plays on radio]

31:29.020 --> 31:31.054
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:33.391 --> 31:37.093
- Be my model.
- Oh.

31:37.128 --> 31:40.163
- Your... your model?
- Get in there.

31:40.198 --> 31:41.999
Come on. Quit stalling.
Get over there.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.703
[music plays louder]

31:46.738 --> 31:48.939
- Okay. Now dance.
- You want me to dance?

31:48.974 --> 31:50.340
- Yes.
- That's not gonna happen.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.575
Okay.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.446
Don't worry.

31:56.481 --> 31:59.082
Sit back.
I will not judge you.

31:59.117 --> 32:00.517
Now dance.

32:04.322 --> 32:06.589
Okay, now a little less douchey.

32:06.624 --> 32:09.192
- [camera clicks]
- I beg your pardon?
Douchey?

32:09.227 --> 32:11.261
Just dance
like no one's watching.

32:11.296 --> 32:13.697
Like, bust a move. Get down.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.966
Oh, that's so good.

32:16.534 --> 32:19.135
Look at you,
you sexy thing.

32:19.170 --> 32:20.604
Ooh, that's a good one.

32:22.073 --> 32:23.006
Oh.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.541
That's a good one.
[laughs]

32:24.576 --> 32:26.376
Wiggle, wiggle the butt.

32:26.411 --> 32:28.645
Gotta get back to the yard...

32:28.680 --> 32:33.083
Excellent depiction
of The Thinker.

32:33.118 --> 32:38.455
Um, the only thing,
is that the thinker was nude.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.523
This is true. You're right.

32:40.558 --> 32:43.426
I, um, am not doing it
all the way right.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.396
So you're gonna have to
take off your clothes.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.298
Are you serious right now?

32:48.333 --> 32:50.233
Yeah. Take off your clothes.

32:50.268 --> 32:52.335
Come on, this is art.
I'm an artist.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.404
Yeah, I don't think
that will matter to the cops

32:54.439 --> 32:56.373
when they bust me
for being nude in public.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.375
Okay, well, we're not going to
leave until I get the shot.

32:58.410 --> 32:59.442
So...

32:59.477 --> 33:00.577
[groans]

33:00.612 --> 33:04.447
Alright. Yeah.
Why not?

33:04.482 --> 33:06.783
There you go.
Bow-chickabow-wow.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.486
- If you have any singles...
- [laughing]

33:09.521 --> 33:10.754
...I appreciate tips.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.555
I'm totally messing with you.

33:12.590 --> 33:14.290
- I know!
- You were stripping!

33:14.325 --> 33:16.292
I'm messing back with you!
I'm not stripping!

33:16.327 --> 33:17.794
- You were taking off
your clothes.
- I was calling your bluff!

33:17.829 --> 33:19.496
You could have been
arrested for that.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.630
I was trying to be The Thinker,

33:20.666 --> 33:23.700
who actually The Thinker
was originally called The Poet.

33:23.735 --> 33:28.505
Right, yeah, it was, um,
it was meant to depict Dante

33:28.540 --> 33:31.474
pondering in front
of the gates of hell.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.575
You know Dante?

33:32.610 --> 33:36.613
Remember tonight for it is
the beginning of always.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.381
Alright, well now you're just
showing off.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.417
That's very impressive.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.419
You know Dante
enough to quote it.

33:42.454 --> 33:43.686
How about that whole
Beatrice thing?

33:43.721 --> 33:45.388
That was a bummer, huh?

33:45.423 --> 33:49.259
I don't know, I think,
I think he loved her.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.361
I think she was his inspiration.

33:52.630 --> 33:55.498
Yeah, it's just a shame he never
got to tell her

33:55.533 --> 33:58.368
how he really felt about her.

33:59.771 --> 34:03.173
Maybe he thought that if he did,

34:03.208 --> 34:06.777
the idea that he had of her
could be changed?

34:14.185 --> 34:16.786
- [camera clicks]
- [laughing]

34:16.821 --> 34:18.822
I didn't know
what was happening.

34:27.532 --> 34:28.697
I gotcha.

34:37.475 --> 34:39.342
Here.

34:39.377 --> 34:41.210
I'll give you a hand.
I got that.

34:41.246 --> 34:42.812
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

34:42.847 --> 34:45.514
- Thank you for driving.
- Oh, my gosh. My pleasure.

34:45.550 --> 34:46.748
It was no trouble at all.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.217
Really?

34:50.221 --> 34:51.286
I didn't say it was a date.

34:51.322 --> 34:53.623
It doesn't need to be a date
for me to be a gentleman.

34:53.658 --> 34:54.591
- Sorry.
- You okay?

34:54.626 --> 34:56.259
- Mm.
- I gotcha.

34:59.297 --> 35:01.564
- [Laura retches]
- Alright.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.733
Okay. That's okay.
You held it in.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.635
- Mm-hm.
- You alright?

35:05.670 --> 35:07.637
Mm-hm. Yep.

35:07.672 --> 35:09.572
Ooh, there you go.
What a trooper.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.474
- Are you going to be okay?
- Yep.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.643
- Mm. Mm-hm.
- You sure? Okay.

35:13.678 --> 35:16.613
Ah, remember to sleep face down.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.248
Don't pull a Hendrix.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.550
Good. I'll see you tomorrow.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.592
[phone buzzes]

35:42.674 --> 35:44.674
Hi.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.376
What are you drinking?
Red wine?

35:46.411 --> 35:48.845
I, ah, am a vodka man myself.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.281
- Can we get two vodkas?
- Yeah.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.448
Perhaps you'll join me?

35:52.483 --> 35:55.518
I gotta say, ah... [chuckles]

35:55.553 --> 35:58.755
That was some pretty interesting
stuff that you were saying.

35:59.857 --> 36:00.956
What you were talking about,

36:00.992 --> 36:07.397
it, ah, was pretty interesting,
but I'm open to it.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.465
- Um...
- Listen, listen, listen.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.202
If you're embarrassed
about the picture, it's okay.

36:12.237 --> 36:15.205
I understand.
It's happened to me already.

36:15.240 --> 36:19.676
You're not the first,
and honestly, comparatively,
you're a pleasant surprise.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.711
I think I might be
into big girls,

36:21.746 --> 36:25.548
because the one who took me home
last night, she blew my mind.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.585
And so if you're game?

36:28.620 --> 36:31.354
I wanna meow with you, Kacy.

36:31.389 --> 36:33.690
I'm not Kacy.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.259
- Justin?
- Kacy!

36:36.294 --> 36:37.794
Hi!

36:37.829 --> 36:40.463
- Hi!
- Good to see you!

36:40.498 --> 36:42.365
- You look like you!
- Good to see you.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.666
Ah, you wanna grab a drink?

36:43.701 --> 36:45.602
- Let's!
- Let's do it.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.804
I'm terribly sorry.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.540
This was a big misunderstanding.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.612
- Have a good night.
- Oh, okay.

37:00.451 --> 37:02.552
[moaning]

37:04.822 --> 37:06.589
- Flip me.
- What?

37:06.624 --> 37:08.691
Flip me. Okay.

37:08.726 --> 37:10.660
Oh... That was fast.

37:10.695 --> 37:11.761
Put it in my butt.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.963
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

37:13.998 --> 37:16.699
- Okay, um, thank you.
- Be gentle.

37:16.734 --> 37:18.768
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay. Just be gentle.

37:18.803 --> 37:21.371
- Oh!
- Gentle! Gentle!

37:21.406 --> 37:22.705
Gentle! Gentle! Gentle!

37:22.740 --> 37:26.276
- [groaning]
- Oh, wow!

37:26.811 --> 37:28.811
Gentle! Gentle! Gentle!

37:28.846 --> 37:31.981
- [groaning]
- Right there! Right there!

37:32.016 --> 37:33.483
You like to breathe?
You like to breathe?

37:33.518 --> 37:34.517
- I--
- Breathe! Breathe!

37:34.553 --> 37:36.519
- I do like... I do like to...
- Turning blue?

37:36.554 --> 37:38.554
- Turning the color blue?
- Tap out! Tap out.

37:38.589 --> 37:41.057
Alright. Okay, sure.
Is that comfortable for you?

37:41.092 --> 37:42.158
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

37:42.193 --> 37:43.860
- Swim... You like to swim?
- I'm swimming to you.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.395
- Swim!
- I'm swimming into you!

37:45.430 --> 37:47.830
I want to drink you up!

37:47.865 --> 37:49.065
[moaning]

37:49.100 --> 37:51.901
I want to drink you up!

37:53.905 --> 37:58.074
- Nice and tasty with a--
- Oh, my God!

37:58.109 --> 37:59.642
Oh, that shouldn't feel good.

37:59.677 --> 38:01.344
- [moaning]
- Oh, wow!

38:02.380 --> 38:03.513
Where'd you go?

38:03.548 --> 38:06.349
- Why are you so fast?
- Juice me, baby!

38:06.384 --> 38:08.385
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

38:08.920 --> 38:10.420
- Yeah.
- Here it comes...

38:10.455 --> 38:12.589
[both moaning]

38:14.058 --> 38:15.692
I'm so sorry.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.927
- So, you came on her purse?
- Mm-hm.

38:17.962 --> 38:21.030
- Well, that's embarrassing.
- Yeah.

38:21.065 --> 38:25.368
All I was thinking, was,
how many different guys
has she been with?

38:25.403 --> 38:26.569
Fifty or a hundred?

38:26.604 --> 38:28.438
- Right.
- Ugh. I feel dirty.

38:29.574 --> 38:32.642
Did you hear about the new
assistant manager position?

38:32.677 --> 38:33.777
That might be cool.

38:36.681 --> 38:40.650
Yeah, if you want to end up like
Earl for the rest of your life.

38:41.552 --> 38:42.852
Well, what's wrong
with Earl's life?

38:42.887 --> 38:45.621
He's got his own office.

38:45.656 --> 38:47.357
His own parking space. A wife.

38:47.392 --> 38:48.691
Those sound like pretty
good perks.

38:48.726 --> 38:49.826
Don't let the job title
fool you.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.828
There's no growth here.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.897
Earl's going to be
manager until he...

38:55.099 --> 38:57.800
...until he
chokes on his own neck.

38:57.835 --> 39:00.002
If you get comfortable here,
if you get comfortable living

39:00.037 --> 39:02.839
paycheck to paycheck, that's how
you get stuck, brother.

39:02.874 --> 39:06.376
And what is the problem
with being comfortable
with job security?

39:06.411 --> 39:09.011
Cause, I don't know if you know
this, but we're in a recession.

39:09.046 --> 39:10.747
Are we in a recession?

39:11.783 --> 39:12.949
I actually don't know.

39:12.984 --> 39:15.818
We're still... Well?
Probably not.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.888
But I feel like,
there are lots of people
who would kill for this job.

39:20.057 --> 39:23.426
There is no one killing to work
at fucking Cal-Telcom.

39:23.461 --> 39:27.630
You know if they offered me
the assistant manager position,
I'd turn that shit down.

39:27.665 --> 39:28.798
You know why?

39:28.833 --> 39:32.869
Cause I value this.
I place value on myself.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.937
Place it on.

39:34.972 --> 39:38.775
And one day, I'm gonna get outta
here and find something better

39:38.810 --> 39:40.877
and something more fulfilling
than working in this rat hole.

39:40.912 --> 39:43.880
Yeah, well, if that's true,
then why don't you just
do something about it?

39:43.915 --> 39:46.115
Either quit, get a job
that doesn't suck,

39:46.150 --> 39:50.086
or stop complaining about it,
because I think, really,
I think you like this job.

39:50.121 --> 39:52.088
Don't fucking talk
that way to me.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.723
Look I'm sorry.

39:53.758 --> 39:55.758
I don't like to be
talked to like that.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.760
- [phone ringing]
- Alright?

39:57.795 --> 39:58.961
Who's calling me?

39:58.996 --> 40:01.798
Oh, it's your mom!
I gotta take this.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.166
Hey, babe.

40:05.169 --> 40:06.870
Hey, Justin.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.171
Earl.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.239
Talked to corporate earlier.

40:09.274 --> 40:12.074
Rumors you hear about them
wanting me to bring on

40:12.109 --> 40:15.645
an assistant manager...
are true.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.947
Oh, good. Oh, yeah.
I'd heard something.

40:17.982 --> 40:19.582
They want to
promote from within.

40:19.617 --> 40:20.750
That's great.
That's awesome.

40:20.785 --> 40:24.921
If I were you, I would see
that as a good opportunity.

40:24.956 --> 40:28.124
And there are a lot of perks.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.860
So, keep up the good work.

40:32.897 --> 40:34.730
Cal-Telcom, this is Justin.

40:34.765 --> 40:35.832
[woman with deep voice]
<i>Hello, Justin.</i>

40:35.867 --> 40:37.133
Hi. How may I be of service?

40:37.168 --> 40:39.869
<i>You were fucking
amazing last night.</i>

40:39.904 --> 40:41.838
I'm sorry, who is this?

40:41.873 --> 40:44.207
<i>You don't remember me?</i>

40:45.576 --> 40:46.609
Kacy?

40:46.644 --> 40:48.010
[Laura] <i> Who's Kacy?</i>

40:48.045 --> 40:50.146
[chuckles]

40:51.649 --> 40:53.716
I knew it was you.

40:53.751 --> 40:54.717
[chuckles]

40:54.752 --> 40:56.886
No, I just made up a name.
I knew it was you.

40:56.921 --> 40:58.921
Um, what's going on?

40:58.956 --> 41:01.891
Um, so I have those pictures
from the other night

41:01.926 --> 41:03.025
if you want to come
check 'em out?

41:03.060 --> 41:04.928
Yeah, yeah.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.068
You don't like them?

41:14.205 --> 41:15.938
- Not really...
- Come on.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.673
No, of course!
These are incredible.

41:17.708 --> 41:19.642
Are you kidding me?
These are amazing!

41:19.677 --> 41:21.110
Have you ever thought of
showing these to anybody?

41:21.145 --> 41:22.712
- No, no, no, no.
- Why not?

41:22.747 --> 41:24.881
No, um...

41:24.916 --> 41:28.551
I showed my friend Emily once
and she said that I could maybe

41:28.586 --> 41:31.621
show them in her gallery,
but I think she might
of just been being nice.

41:31.656 --> 41:34.924
I know nothing about photos,
and I'm interested by these.

41:34.959 --> 41:35.892
So I should trust your opinion?

41:35.927 --> 41:36.993
Yeah!

41:37.028 --> 41:40.096
- If, if I were to show them...
- When.

41:40.131 --> 41:43.866
...at her gallery,
would you go and be my date?

41:43.901 --> 41:47.203
That is of course unless you
completely are afraid

41:47.238 --> 41:49.205
of doing it because I almost
puked on you the other night.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.740
- Which is totally okay!
- Exactly.

41:50.775 --> 41:52.141
No, that was
my first thought, like,

41:52.177 --> 41:55.044
- am I going to be in danger
of being vomited on?
- Right. Right.

41:55.079 --> 41:57.613
- But you know,
you held it in, so...
- I did.

41:57.648 --> 41:59.682
I'll man up. Alright.

41:59.717 --> 42:01.150
You do the showing,
I'll be your date.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.519
Deal.

42:07.792 --> 42:10.693
- [Sammy] Laura from work Laura?
- Laura from work Laura.

42:10.728 --> 42:12.228
[Sammy] But you're still
gonna do the online thing?

42:12.263 --> 42:13.496
Yeah, I don't know
about that, man.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.865
I kind of want to see where this
thing with Laura goes, you know?

42:15.900 --> 42:18.901
[Sammy] Dude, do not get back
right into a relationship.

42:18.936 --> 42:20.169
Why not?

42:20.204 --> 42:24.007
Isn't that what this
whole online dating thing
is about anyway?

42:25.142 --> 42:28.077
No. It's about
having sex with sluts.

42:28.112 --> 42:30.313
Well, I wouldn't
call them sluts.

42:30.348 --> 42:31.847
Well, that's what they are.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.816
That's what Casual Encounters
is all about.

42:33.851 --> 42:34.850
What do you mean?

42:34.886 --> 42:37.987
Casual Encounters
are all people who are DTF.

42:38.022 --> 42:38.721
Do you know what that means?

42:38.756 --> 42:41.357
- Yeah.
- Tell me. I don't know.

42:41.392 --> 42:45.761
- Down to fuck.
- Yes. Easy lays.

42:45.796 --> 42:47.930
Besides, Laura is primo.

42:47.965 --> 42:50.032
A girl like that
you only get one shot at.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.902
You can't cum on her purse.
She won't stand for it.

42:52.937 --> 42:56.038
- I'll conference Louis in.
- No, please don't do that.

42:56.073 --> 42:59.742
- Laura from work Laura?
- Laura from work Laura.

42:59.777 --> 43:01.077
I see.

43:01.112 --> 43:05.114
And now young Justin
is wanting to put all
his eggs in her basket.

43:05.149 --> 43:07.283
- That is a mistake.
- Wait. Why is that?

43:07.318 --> 43:09.952
Because those eggs
might not hatch.

43:09.987 --> 43:11.053
Thank you!

43:11.088 --> 43:12.154
You don't Laura's intentions

43:12.189 --> 43:15.992
and she could be seeing
other people just as well.

43:16.027 --> 43:18.894
- I don't think she is.
- Well, you don't know for sure.

43:18.929 --> 43:22.331
Best to just keep your options
open until you do.

43:22.366 --> 43:25.301
Besides, it will benefit you
if you end up with Laura.

43:25.336 --> 43:26.903
How so?

43:27.905 --> 43:30.139
Laura is primo.

43:30.174 --> 43:32.708
That's funny, because you know
that's exactly what I said.

43:32.743 --> 43:34.310
- You're learning.
- [Justin] Wait, um, I'm sorry.

43:34.345 --> 43:36.746
Can someone explain to me
what primo means?

43:36.781 --> 43:39.782
Laura is an exquisite woman

43:39.817 --> 43:43.986
and is accustomed to
a specific kind of partner.

43:44.021 --> 43:45.388
Did you know Paul?

43:45.423 --> 43:46.989
Her ex? No.

43:47.024 --> 43:49.258
Well I did.
He was in the Navy.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.193
Travelled the world,
port to port,

43:51.228 --> 43:55.965
learning God knows what
kind of incredible techniques.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.734
That's what Laura
is accustomed to.

43:58.769 --> 44:00.135
Do you have any dates planned?

44:00.171 --> 44:03.873
I actually have one for tonight,
but I was thinking about
canceling it.

44:03.908 --> 44:05.241
[both] Don't!

44:05.276 --> 44:07.109
Don't do that, fucker!

44:07.144 --> 44:10.179
Just keep the date
as planned and be open.

44:10.214 --> 44:14.083
Alright, but I'm telling you,
I'm not gonna be into it.

44:14.785 --> 44:16.085
[moaning]

44:19.857 --> 44:20.990
[grunts]

44:23.027 --> 44:23.959
[growls]

44:23.994 --> 44:26.195
[laughing]

44:26.230 --> 44:27.396
Oh, my God.

44:27.431 --> 44:29.098
You want to do something kinky?

44:29.133 --> 44:30.933
Sure.

44:30.968 --> 44:32.268
Woo!

44:32.303 --> 44:33.836
- Woo-hoo!
- How about a blumpie?

44:33.871 --> 44:36.472
- Yeah, that sounds good to me.
- Whoooo!

44:36.507 --> 44:39.275
- Yee-ha!
- Blumpies are so hot!

44:39.310 --> 44:40.309
- Okay.
- Mmmm.

44:40.344 --> 44:41.944
- Sure.
- Come with me, stud.

44:41.979 --> 44:43.179
Okay.

44:48.819 --> 44:50.219
Oh, yes.
I like blumpies.

44:50.254 --> 44:52.822
I never called it
a blumpie before.

44:52.857 --> 44:54.056
Come on, let's go.

44:54.091 --> 44:57.159
Take the
Browns to the Superbowl.

44:57.194 --> 44:58.928
What exactly do you mean?

44:58.963 --> 45:01.497
- Take a shit.
- Ohhh! Fuck.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.099
Ew! Ew! Ew!

45:03.134 --> 45:05.735
Oh, God, what is wrong with you?

45:05.770 --> 45:06.869
No!

45:06.904 --> 45:07.870
I...

45:07.905 --> 45:11.273
Listen, I'm sorry but I
am not that kind of guy.

45:11.308 --> 45:14.176
Okay?

45:14.211 --> 45:18.147
And if I'm being honest,
Mercedes, tonight was a mistake.

45:18.182 --> 45:19.381
And it's not your fault.

45:19.417 --> 45:23.886
Actually there is this girl
who is, she's amazing and, um,

45:23.921 --> 45:25.988
I think I'm falling for her.

45:26.023 --> 45:29.258
And so this feels really wrong
and it's not you it's...

45:29.293 --> 45:32.094
Mercedes... Mercedes, shit!

45:32.129 --> 45:34.864
Mercedes. Oh, no, no, no.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.299
Oh, no. Please don't die.

45:37.334 --> 45:39.201
I don't know how to
fucking do that.

45:39.236 --> 45:41.470
Godammit, Sammy!
Alright, we gotta get you help!

45:41.505 --> 45:43.973
We gotta get you help, honey.
Oh, my gosh.

45:44.008 --> 45:47.409
Up we go. One, two, three.
I'm so sorry. Okay.

45:47.444 --> 45:48.477
- [head bumps against door]
- Oh, shit.

45:48.512 --> 45:51.114
I am sorry twice now.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.453
Are you a doctor?

45:57.488 --> 46:00.122
Are you a doctor or a nurse?
I can't tell.

46:00.157 --> 46:01.957
Here we go.
I got you there.

46:01.992 --> 46:06.162
She's unconscious.
She hit her head
and she hasn't woken up.

46:06.197 --> 46:10.232
We were in the bathroom...
Do you know what a blumpie is?

46:10.267 --> 46:11.233
I know what a blumpie is.

46:11.268 --> 46:13.402
Okay, cause I didn't
and it's disgusting, right?

46:13.437 --> 46:15.571
But she wouldn't stop,
so I tried to just

46:15.606 --> 46:16.972
push her off of me
and she hit her head.

46:17.008 --> 46:20.143
I've never seen someone
get knocked unconscious from
a blumpie before.

46:21.245 --> 46:22.178
Is she going to be okay?

46:22.213 --> 46:23.312
I mean, there's no blood, but...

46:23.347 --> 46:24.346
You're going to need
to go inside

46:24.381 --> 46:25.848
and fill out an incident report.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.251
I'm not going to do that.

46:31.989 --> 46:34.490
[car door shuts]
[tires screech]

46:47.638 --> 46:49.272
Hey, Earl.

46:50.007 --> 46:51.173
You're early.

46:51.208 --> 46:53.509
Yes, I am.

46:53.544 --> 46:55.411
I like it.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.814
It shows leadership qualities.

46:59.049 --> 47:02.484
Of course,
I get in around 8:30.

47:02.519 --> 47:06.388
- That's impressive.
- Don't clock in before 9:00.

47:06.423 --> 47:07.990
You got it.

47:08.025 --> 47:09.158
[cell phone buzzes]

47:13.330 --> 47:14.330
Hi, Mom.

47:14.365 --> 47:15.931
<i>[Mom]
Oh! Finally.</i>

47:15.966 --> 47:17.099
<i>How's everything going?</i>

47:17.134 --> 47:18.334
Ah... fine.

47:18.369 --> 47:20.269
<i>Oh, Sammy tells me
that you've been</i>

47:20.304 --> 47:22.338
<i>going on some online dates.</i>

47:22.373 --> 47:24.540
<i>Have you been meeting,
you know, some nice girls?</i>

47:24.575 --> 47:26.976
No, Mom, I have not been
meeting nice girls.

47:27.011 --> 47:29.345
I've been meeting almost the
exact opposite of nice girls.

47:29.380 --> 47:30.379
<i>Oh, come on, come on.</i>

47:30.414 --> 47:31.614
Mom, I can't, I'm at work.

47:31.649 --> 47:32.648
Okay. I lov...
I'll talk to you later.

47:32.684 --> 47:35.551
I'll call you back.
Bye, bye. I love you, bye.

47:35.586 --> 47:39.222
His body was hard like
Michelangelo's David.

47:40.324 --> 47:41.457
- I could feel myself warming--
- [clicks off]

47:41.492 --> 47:44.426
- Hey, Louis.
- Hello, Justin.

47:44.461 --> 47:48.564
I need you to delete my profile
from Casual Encounters
immediately, please.

47:48.599 --> 47:50.900
Okay. Not a problem.

47:50.935 --> 47:53.602
- Can I get a reason?
- Oh, I'll give you a few.

47:53.637 --> 47:56.338
There's the 300 pound
girl who broke my bed.

47:56.373 --> 48:01.143
There's the one woman
ass-circus nympho who forced me
to shoot my load in her face.

48:01.178 --> 48:02.377
I thought you came
on her purse?

48:02.413 --> 48:04.380
And then there's last night,
where I found myself dragging

48:04.415 --> 48:07.216
a girl's unconscious body
from my bathroom to the ER.

48:07.251 --> 48:10.286
She's fine, I think.
It's not for me.

48:10.321 --> 48:12.621
Okay?
And I've actually...

48:12.656 --> 48:15.190
I've got something
really great going on so...

48:15.225 --> 48:19.228
We often find our destiny taking
a road we took to avoid it.

48:19.263 --> 48:20.696
Un-huh.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.232
That means you're going to
delete the stuff, right?

48:23.267 --> 48:25.434
- Oh, yeah. I'll delete it.
- Thank you.

48:28.405 --> 48:30.506
So, how did it go last night?

48:30.541 --> 48:32.408
I'm done with Casual Encounters.

48:32.443 --> 48:33.676
Oh no. What happened?

48:33.711 --> 48:35.711
This stupid thing never works.

48:35.746 --> 48:36.945
That thing is just for show.

48:36.981 --> 48:39.715
I think I just need to figure
out my love life on my own.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.083
I understand.

48:41.118 --> 48:42.685
I went to the doctor yesterday

48:42.720 --> 48:44.453
and found out
some very bad news.

48:44.488 --> 48:45.354
You got an STD?

48:45.389 --> 48:49.391
I have the old acid reflux.

48:49.426 --> 48:54.096
Been spitting up gunk for,
geez, just about 18 months now.

48:54.131 --> 48:55.331
And you just went to the doctor?

48:55.366 --> 48:57.433
Well, I was handling it myself,

48:57.468 --> 48:59.168
you know, bananas and peaches.

48:59.203 --> 49:00.436
- Um...
- Didn't help.

49:00.471 --> 49:04.239
So anyway,
it's 40 milligrams of Prilosec

49:04.274 --> 49:05.708
everyday from here on in.

49:05.743 --> 49:07.242
[chuckles]

49:07.277 --> 49:09.378
You know, you never know what's
gonna get ya,

49:09.413 --> 49:12.381
but we all die from something.

49:12.416 --> 49:15.050
I don't think acid reflux is
going to kill you.

49:15.085 --> 49:17.386
Did you know
our health insurance
only covers 20 percent?

49:17.421 --> 49:20.389
- I actually did.
- That's a little strange.

49:20.424 --> 49:22.491
Yeah, I'll see you, buddy.

49:22.526 --> 49:24.526
Oh, yeah.

49:24.561 --> 49:26.562
[English accent]
Crackers and knickers!
Crackers and knickers!

49:26.597 --> 49:28.464
[laughing]

49:28.499 --> 49:32.368
Ooh! Hold a tick,
time for my spot of tea.

49:32.403 --> 49:33.736
- [normal voice] Hey.
- Hey.

49:33.771 --> 49:37.573
Um, I know that you had said
that I could be your date

49:37.608 --> 49:41.643
for the exhibit,
but I was wondering
if maybe in the meantime,

49:41.678 --> 49:44.213
you would like to
grab dinner or something?

49:44.248 --> 49:46.515
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:46.550 --> 49:51.020
Um, I live with my mom, and so
maybe I should pick you up?

49:51.055 --> 49:53.122
Yeah, oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Sure.

49:53.157 --> 49:54.289
She could come with us?

49:54.324 --> 49:55.424
- Mmmmmm?
- No, yeah you're right.

49:55.459 --> 49:56.425
- Just us.
- Just us.

49:56.460 --> 49:58.027
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

49:58.062 --> 50:00.396
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

50:00.431 --> 50:01.730
- Okay.
- Sure.

50:01.765 --> 50:03.499
- We'll do it.
- Sure.

50:03.534 --> 50:05.067
- Great.
- Yep.

50:07.337 --> 50:10.105
Aw. Tulips.
I love tulips.

50:10.140 --> 50:11.206
I'm glad.

50:11.241 --> 50:14.510
And may I say, your two lips
aren't too shabby either?

50:14.545 --> 50:17.413
- [laughs]
- That was cheesy?

50:17.448 --> 50:19.314
Yeah, it was cheesy.
Cheesy's good.

50:19.349 --> 50:21.383
Okay. So where'd you want
to go tonight?

50:21.418 --> 50:24.086
Um, I was thinking maybe
Carson House?

50:24.121 --> 50:27.423
Yeah, I mean, do you want
to try something new maybe?

50:27.458 --> 50:28.491
Or something different?

50:28.526 --> 50:31.126
Honestly, when it comes to,
like, food and bars,

50:31.161 --> 50:33.762
- I kinda like the same.
- Okay. Same.

50:33.797 --> 50:35.364
Let's do it.

50:37.401 --> 50:39.435
[music plays]

50:41.338 --> 50:44.706
- Louis is here.
- Oh, and he's got a friend.

50:44.741 --> 50:46.742
Two machine guns.

50:46.777 --> 50:48.310
Oh.

50:48.345 --> 50:50.245
We didn't,
we didn't order these, right?

50:50.280 --> 50:52.481
- No, ah, I ah, thanks...
- She's a cutie.

50:52.516 --> 50:53.515
[chuckles]

50:53.550 --> 50:55.517
- A shot before dinner?
- I know.

50:55.552 --> 50:56.618
It's...
it's terrible, isn't it?

50:56.653 --> 50:58.520
I apologize. Do you not...
we don't have to do it.

50:58.555 --> 51:00.322
- Don't apologize! Let's...
- Is that okay? Are you game?

51:00.357 --> 51:01.590
- Yeah. Let's do this.
- Start it up.

51:01.625 --> 51:03.159
Alright.

51:05.596 --> 51:07.563
- That was terrible.
- Yeah.

51:07.598 --> 51:10.799
Um, so, what did she
whisper to you?

51:10.834 --> 51:12.668
- You wanna know?
- It looked nice. Yeah.

51:12.703 --> 51:13.802
- It was very pleasant.
- Mm-hm.

51:13.837 --> 51:16.405
Uh, she told me
that you are a cutie.

51:16.440 --> 51:17.506
- She did.
- Cutie?

51:17.541 --> 51:18.574
That's literally what she said.

51:18.609 --> 51:20.442
I think she might be
a lesbian for you.

51:20.477 --> 51:24.246
- Guys! Hey!
- Louis, you found us!

51:24.548 --> 51:26.148
This is epic!

51:26.183 --> 51:26.882
Outside of work.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.317
- I know.
- Weird!

51:28.352 --> 51:30.152
- We're real people. What?
- Yeah.

51:30.187 --> 51:33.388
- You guys are the best!
- You are!

51:33.423 --> 51:36.592
[laughs]
Well, have a magical night.

51:36.627 --> 51:38.293
- Together.
- Thank you.

51:38.328 --> 51:39.561
- Yeah.
- Okay...

51:39.596 --> 51:42.898
She is primo. Primo!

51:42.933 --> 51:45.234
- [Justin laughs uncomfortably]
- What did he say?

51:45.269 --> 51:48.737
I think, well he said "primo."
It's Italian for co-worker.

51:48.772 --> 51:51.440
People are just, like,
whispering left and right...

51:51.475 --> 51:54.610
Yeah, I-I come here,
I guess a fair amount.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.578
- Okay.
- So, date question.

51:56.613 --> 51:58.881
- Okay.
- Do you have any siblings?

51:58.916 --> 52:00.449
- No.
- Okay.

52:00.484 --> 52:02.484
What about you?
Do you have siblings?

52:02.519 --> 52:04.786
Also an only child.
My mom and dad

52:04.821 --> 52:07.890
sat me down when I was six
and asked me if I wanted
a brother or sister.

52:07.925 --> 52:08.891
What'd you say?

52:08.926 --> 52:11.226
I told them that
I wanted a cat.

52:11.261 --> 52:13.629
Be careful, because you don't
want to end up that sort of

52:13.664 --> 52:17.566
sad cat lady,
who, you know, she spends
all her time and affection

52:17.601 --> 52:22.471
on feeding and watering
and talking to
and putting in outfits

52:22.506 --> 52:27.176
and dressing up in Christmas
sweaters around the holidays
for her Christmas card.

52:27.211 --> 52:28.544
That's totally me.

52:28.579 --> 52:30.646
- Oh.
- I have a cat,

52:30.681 --> 52:34.216
and I knit my cat really
awesome Christmas sweaters.

52:34.251 --> 52:37.686
I don't... I was thinking of,
like, a cat lady,

52:37.721 --> 52:41.924
like old and you know,
you're, you're not,
I don't...

52:41.959 --> 52:43.725
I'm sorry if I hurt
your feelings.

52:43.760 --> 52:45.727
- Did you make me bleed?
- I hope not.

52:45.762 --> 52:48.230
Did you break my heart? Did...

52:48.265 --> 52:52.401
- No, I don't think so.
- Okay, then stop apologizing.

52:52.436 --> 52:54.270
- It's alright.
- Gotcha.

52:57.574 --> 53:00.576
[music plays]

53:02.579 --> 53:07.583
Um, so I have
been thinking about the exhibit.

53:07.618 --> 53:09.184
- If I were to do a show...
- Yes!

53:09.220 --> 53:14.389
- If. Um, I picked some photos
that I would use potentially.
- Show me! Yes!

53:14.424 --> 53:16.625
- Um, my...
- Show me!

53:16.660 --> 53:18.727
- My... right down in my bag.
- Yeah, yeah.

53:18.762 --> 53:20.896
- So...
- Oh, look at this.

53:20.931 --> 53:23.799
Very professional.
I like that.

53:24.635 --> 53:26.835
Oh, wow. That's awesome.

53:27.638 --> 53:29.671
You're very good.

53:29.706 --> 53:31.673
This is amazing.

53:31.708 --> 53:34.643
Did you talk to your friend?
To Emily?

53:36.313 --> 53:37.679
- No.
- You didn't call her?

53:37.714 --> 53:39.581
- No.
- Why not?

53:39.616 --> 53:42.718
What if people don't like it?

53:42.753 --> 53:44.720
Well, rejection is a fucker.

53:44.755 --> 53:48.624
I'm not saying they'll reject
your work, I just mean,

53:48.659 --> 53:53.595
I know how it feels and so
to be afraid is understandable.

53:53.630 --> 53:58.467
But you should push through,
because I think you have a gift.

53:59.336 --> 54:00.936
You make the world prettier.

54:04.341 --> 54:06.441
Um, sorry, is this your phone?

54:06.476 --> 54:07.575
- This is yours, right?
- Yeah.

54:07.611 --> 54:09.845
Do you mind if I just
make a call on it real quick?

54:09.880 --> 54:11.280
- No. No.
- Do you mind if I--

54:11.315 --> 54:12.781
- Okay... No!
- You don't mind?

54:12.816 --> 54:13.815
- Oh, thank you.
- No, no, no...

54:13.851 --> 54:16.318
There's no passcode on this!
That's dangerous!

54:16.353 --> 54:18.787
You are not supposed to mess
with a lady's telephone!

54:18.822 --> 54:21.556
You... don't you know
to believe in yourself?

54:21.591 --> 54:22.724
Do you know that lesson though?

54:22.759 --> 54:25.327
- I would...
- But I would, if I...

54:25.362 --> 54:26.595
It's call... It's ringing...

54:26.630 --> 54:28.597
It will be rude
if we hang up now.

54:29.966 --> 54:31.733
Hi. Is this Emily?

54:31.768 --> 54:33.769
Hi. This is Justin.

54:33.804 --> 54:36.605
Uh, no, Laura's fine.

54:36.640 --> 54:39.641
Um, I work with Laura.
I'm Justin.

54:39.676 --> 54:41.643
You've heard of me?
That's interesting.

54:41.678 --> 54:46.648
Well, Emily, the reason
I am calling you
is cause I happen to feel

54:46.683 --> 54:48.984
that Laura is the most
talented photographer

54:49.019 --> 54:53.489
I have ever seen and she
mentioned to me your offer.

54:54.791 --> 54:55.858
Yes.

54:57.761 --> 54:59.662
I understand.

55:00.530 --> 55:02.431
Alright. Thank you.

55:02.466 --> 55:03.765
Nice talking to you, Emily.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.434
Yeah, bye.
Have a good night.

55:10.474 --> 55:13.809
Oh... what did she...
What did she say?

55:13.844 --> 55:14.976
Oh you want to know
about the phone call?

55:15.011 --> 55:16.611
You're right, I'm sorry.
That's rude.

55:16.646 --> 55:18.847
She told me that
starting this Friday,

55:18.882 --> 55:20.983
you will have a place
for people to view your work.

55:23.553 --> 55:25.754
[music plays]

55:52.482 --> 55:57.052
Um, do you mind if
we just wait for this?

55:57.087 --> 55:58.153
- Of course, sure.
- Yeah?

55:58.188 --> 55:59.688
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay.

55:59.723 --> 56:01.223
- You okay?
- Yeah. No, no. I'm good.

56:01.258 --> 56:05.794
- I just, I just think we should
lay a little bit.
- I love laying. I love it.

56:05.829 --> 56:07.129
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

56:09.966 --> 56:11.600
This is nice.

56:12.769 --> 56:15.704
I haven't been this happy
in a long time.

56:22.679 --> 56:24.947
[alarm beeps]

56:31.822 --> 56:33.722
- [sighs]
- Mm.

56:37.794 --> 56:40.896
What do you say
we just skip work

56:40.931 --> 56:42.864
and stay in
and hang out all day?

56:42.899 --> 56:46.067
I'd say that's, like,
the best idea you've ever had.

56:46.102 --> 56:47.235
Yeah.

56:47.270 --> 56:51.606
But, ah, I'm up for the
assistant manager position...

56:51.641 --> 56:53.809
- Right.
- ...so I feel like I should be
on my best behavior.

56:53.844 --> 56:55.143
I'm so sorry.
Are you mad?

56:55.178 --> 56:56.678
- No.
- Don't me mad at me.

56:56.713 --> 56:58.046
- No, I'm not.
- Okay. Raincheck?

56:58.081 --> 56:59.448
Yes.

56:59.483 --> 57:01.483
Um, did you know Earl

57:01.518 --> 57:03.819
had that same conversation
with Sammy and I?

57:03.854 --> 57:04.920
He did? He said that?

57:04.955 --> 57:07.923
I didn't know that.
That's awesome. That's great.

57:07.958 --> 57:10.759
I think if you want to do that,
you should do that,

57:10.794 --> 57:13.161
because you would be,
you'd be great at it.

57:13.196 --> 57:15.564
No, I don't I don't,
I don't want it.

57:15.599 --> 57:16.998
I think Sammy does.

57:17.033 --> 57:18.700
I think it would be
down to you guys, but--

57:18.735 --> 57:20.936
Sammy literally told
me he did not want it.

57:20.971 --> 57:23.705
He said that to me. And he's
terrible at his current job.

57:23.740 --> 57:26.975
No, he's...
he's trying to be cool.

57:27.978 --> 57:30.479
Are you playing it cool?

57:30.514 --> 57:33.582
No, I'm just,
I'm just really cool.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.050
- You are very cool.
- Mm-hmm.

57:35.085 --> 57:36.885
I'm gonna get in the shower.
You gonna stay in bed?

57:36.920 --> 57:38.854
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57:43.927 --> 57:45.560
The one that's blinking
is great.

57:45.595 --> 57:48.897
So why don't you go ahead
and pull out the power cord.

57:48.932 --> 57:52.534
Great. And then wait about
10 to 15 seconds
to plug it back in.

57:52.569 --> 57:54.002
That's right.

Alright, that's great to hear.

but I hope you have
a great night,

58:02.012 --> 58:03.979

Wow.

Could you, um,
just excuse me for a minute?

58:26.836 --> 58:29.070
This close
to having a threesome.

This close.

58:31.141 --> 58:32.307

I'm joking,
I'm joking with you.

I'll get it.
I'll get it eventually.

- Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

58:37.914 --> 58:41.049
You look... wow.
Really wow.

58:41.084 --> 58:42.250
Thanks.

58:42.285 --> 58:46.054
You always look wow, but this
is a very special kind of wow.

58:46.089 --> 58:48.623
- Thank you.
- And this is amazing!

58:48.658 --> 58:50.292
You did it!
You really did it.

58:50.327 --> 58:52.861
And I got you
a little something to celebrate.

Ooh! Okay.

58:58.668 --> 59:01.970
Looks like I'm gonna have to go
on the two finger diet
for this one, huh?

No! It's a cat sweater.

59:04.941 --> 59:09.077
Yeah, you wouldn't fit,
I mean, you could fit probably.

59:09.112 --> 59:11.680
You could try if you really,
you know, you're...

59:11.715 --> 59:13.114
You're not fat.

59:13.149 --> 59:14.916
- It's perfect.
- Oh, good.

when she's not texting.

she had a face. Yeah.

meet you in person.

- I've heard so much about you.

59:57.093 --> 59:58.159
- You have?
- Oh...

59:58.194 --> 59:59.894
Not so much.

- Like, psycho stalker much.
- There's truth behind her eyes.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:04.332
You seem like
you're hiding something.

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:06.301
Well, on that lovely note.

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:07.302

- Yeah. Great.

look at your stuff.

going to be a round two.

have been a round one.

- My husband's here.
- You're married?!

01:00:27.124 --> 01:00:30.091
Oh, he doesn't know about us.
It's just our little secret.

No. Okay. Well, no.

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.861
It's not a secret
cause there is no us.

I need you to listen, okay?

Alright?

I actually didn't want
to go on the date.

but things got carried away

you out in my bathroom.

I'm not into this, okay?

if I let you down.

- Stop it.
- Let me explain.

Explain?! You were making out
with Earl's wife at my showing?

<i>Chop, chop.</i>

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:17.092
Mm-mm-mm.

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:19.294
Sit.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:26.568
Um... Were you wearing
those clothes yesterday?

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:27.435
Yes.

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:29.337
- Listen, Earl--
- You got the promotion.

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:30.705
I got the what?

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:35.076
You have been selected to be
the new assistant manager
of Cal-Telcom.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:37.345
Really?

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:41.983
But, um, I think now
that you're management.

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:43.518
You're going to need to
take care of that--

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.286
- Right. Sure.
- Stubble.

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:48.156
I... I do have a razor
in here somewhere.

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:53.928
Oh, and I think I am going to
take Sammy up on his
office party suggestion.

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:59.467
Maybe we could just celebrate
you as the new assistant manager
also at that time?

01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:11.279
Earl. I don't agree with the
inter-office dating policy.

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:13.214
Oh.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.083
I actually don't agree with
a lot of the policies.

01:04:15.118 --> 01:04:17.919
And you never ever
listen to my suggestions.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:21.656
Did you know, did you know,
that our elevator hasn't passed
inspection since June?

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:25.260
Of 1978. Okay.
That's not the point.

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:28.496
The point is
I don't like working here.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:32.333
At all. So I regretfully
will turn down the position.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.501
Not even regretfully.

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:36.671
I'm turning the position down
and this is my resignation.

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.473
You should give the assistant
manager job to Sammy.

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:41.376
He wants it and you would be
lucky to have him.

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.147
Um. Can you just hold
for one minute

01:04:46.182 --> 01:04:48.950
while I check with
one of our advisors?

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:52.287
Laura.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.658
Just forget about it.

01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:58.660
I can't.
I can't forget about it.

01:04:58.695 --> 01:04:59.694
I feel awful.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:03.965
Um, what's up with the box?

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.669
Oh, um, I quit.

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:11.272
- You quit?
- Mm-hm.

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:14.342
What about the manager,
the assistant manager job?

01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:18.413
Yeah, uh, I was stuck.

01:05:19.716 --> 01:05:22.150
I... I'm so sorry.

01:05:22.185 --> 01:05:24.052
I really am. I'm sorry.

01:05:24.087 --> 01:05:26.254
Wasn't even the worst
part of the night?

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:28.423
- No one bought anything.
- What?

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.591
- So, yeah...
- You're kidding?

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.460
Uh, nope.

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:35.296
I think Emily lost a lot of
money on the night

01:05:35.331 --> 01:05:38.266
and I offered to pay her back,
but I don't think
she's gonna let me.

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:41.536
Laura, I'm... You know,
it was your first show.

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:44.305
Um, you know, I should really,
I have a call

01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.406
and I should be
getting back to it.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.642
Can I just,
before you do that...

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.312
After Sarah, before I met you,

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:55.183
I was depressed
and I got some bad advice.

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:57.518
So I started dating online

01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:59.387
and it was just
supposed to be casual,

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:02.490
but I didn't know that
casual meant blatant sex,

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:07.295
which I... I was lonely
so I went on a few dates.

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.496
And one of those dates
was Earl's wife,

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.198
but I did not know
it was Earl's wife.

01:06:10.233 --> 01:06:11.332
I swear.

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:12.667
Not until I saw her
at your show.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:15.603
And we didn't have sex.
That's true. We did not.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:19.407
There was other...
there was sucking...
that is not important.

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:21.743
I was trying to tell her
that I love you.

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:24.212
I love you, Laura.

01:06:25.782 --> 01:06:26.715
Hey.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:30.218
Earl, I really
have to talk to you... Um...

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:39.094
You know what?
I'm sorry I roughed you up
the other night.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.262
[chuckles]

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:42.730
Uh, it's fine.

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:46.301
You're not that strong
and I work out.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:52.640
I'm sorry that I fucked things
up for you and Laura.

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.510
- No--
- I did. I did.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:59.380
No. No, I fucked things up
for me and Laura.

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:00.681
You did.

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.583
I don't know that it
means anything now,

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:06.054
but I told Earl he should
give you the assistant manager
position.

01:07:06.089 --> 01:07:07.022
- What?
- Yeah.

01:07:07.057 --> 01:07:09.524
Why did you do that?
I don't want that job.

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:10.458
Because... Yes you do.

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:11.392
- I do not.
- Yes you do.

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:12.660
- I know you do.
- I do do--

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:14.462
Laura told me.

01:07:16.332 --> 01:07:18.699
- She told you?
- Yeah, she did.

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:21.702
[sighs deeply]

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:23.504
It wasn't like I was trying
to go behind your back.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:25.106
- You know that, right?
- No, no. Yeah.

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:29.377
God, no. No, no, no.
I, uh, I think it's a good idea.

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:34.682
I think if you just
apply yourself, I think
you'll be great, man.

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:39.787
You know, you're a lot like
your mom, cause she said
the exact same thing.

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:42.256
Yeah, why do you call my mom?

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:44.459
Well, she's a lot better
than my mom.

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:01.576
Hi, mom.

01:08:01.611 --> 01:08:03.478
<i>[Mom] Hi, honey.</i>

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.582
<i>How are ya?</i>

01:08:07.617 --> 01:08:11.252
- I'm not happy.
<i>- I know. I'm sorry.</i>

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:15.456
<i>Look, I can come over if you
don't want to be alone?</i>

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:17.425
Thank you, Mom.
I appreciate that.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.228
<i>Justin, you just have to go out
there and fight your corner.</i>

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.697
<i>You know, figure out what you
want and fight for it.</i>

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:25.733
<i>You have always been good
at problem solving,</i>

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:28.870
<i>so I want you
to solve your own.</i>

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:31.606
<i>I know you can do this, Justin.</i>

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.841
Thank you, Mom.
I love you.

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.710
<i>I love you more.</i>

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:37.511
Bye.

[music plays]

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.228

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.533
[indistinct chatter]

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.805
- It's... It's good.
- Yep.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:42.911
Chantal.

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:54.655
Boy, that Justin's a hell
of a... hell of a good dude.

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:56.924
- Mm-hm.
- And he likes you.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:10:00.495
Likes you more than anyone.
More than me.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:02.530
So?

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.700
Won't you give him
a second chance?

01:10:05.735 --> 01:10:06.968
[clears throat]

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:12.273
Earl's, like, really given you
the reigns on the party, huh?

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:13.908
As he should.
[chuckles]

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.543
I'm the assistant manager here.

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:18.713
You know I don't think Earl
has ever ever even attempted
to throw a party like this.

01:10:18.748 --> 01:10:21.949
I doubt Earl has ever even been
to a party like this one.

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.517
I'm sure Earl's been to a party.

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.853
Not like this,
not a party like this.

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:30.458
- Sorry--
- Laura, hey... I need to
show you something.

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:34.562
Why did you come here?

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.731
Sammy, you said
Earl wouldn't be here!

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:39.400
I said he shouldn't be here,
because you'd be here,

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:40.568
but of course he'd be here.

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:43.271
[grunting] Please, Earl.
I just need to talk to Laura.

01:10:43.306 --> 01:10:44.772
- Fuck you.
- I'm so sorry about Mercedes!

01:10:44.807 --> 01:10:46.841
- I swear I had no idea!
- I don't want one more word!

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:47.675
You've ruined my marriage!

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:49.677
- You've ruin-
- Earl, let him go!

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.779
You cheated on me with him!

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:53.481
[grunting]

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:56.684
Oh!

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:00.454
[yells]

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:01.555
Sammy!

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.724
[muffled] Laura, I love you.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:06.494
I love you.
I am a one-woman man. I swear.

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:10.765
I was with the wrong one woman,
but you're the right one woman.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.668
I will prove it to you!
I will fight for you!

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:14.635
[grunts]

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.037
I will prove it you right now!

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:17.805
Earl, please! Stop!

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:18.973
[muffled] Maybe you should
listen to her.

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:21.976
Maybe you should be held
accountable for not listening

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:25.813
to her needs and
that's what ultimately drove her
to look elsewhere.

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:28.783
Earl, he's right.
We need to talk.

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:31.952
I really need
a red room of pain.

01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:33.621
[groans]

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:35.690
I am so sorry.

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:42.663
Laura, please,
just come with me.

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:44.665
Justin, I told you,
forget about it.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.636
And I said I wouldn't,
because I want you.

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:51.005
And if you just come with me,
I'll show you--

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.675
Just... go.

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:58.412
Just... get the hell out.

01:11:58.447 --> 01:11:59.714
Go!

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.660
Hey, Laura.

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:15.096
Hey. It's me, Sammy.

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:16.831
Are you okay?

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.467
Um, I'm fine.

01:12:20.069 --> 01:12:22.803
That was pretty crazy, huh?

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:26.674
Hey, listen. I kind of need you
do to me the biggest favor ever.

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:28.743
Sure.

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:33.748
Would you be so kind as
to go and grab the keg?

01:12:33.783 --> 01:12:36.784
- Earl okayed a keg?
- He sure did.

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.753
He's feeling
really vulnerable right now,

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:40.154
so I got my hooks in him.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.790
I'll text you the address.

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:45.993
You know,
Justin's right about you,

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:50.865
you really are...
a special lady.

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:56.137

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:12.853

to him cupping her breast...</i>

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:25.400
That's not, sorry, he, uh,
went of text pretty quick.

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:30.604
I wasn't bullshitting
when I said you make
the world prettier.

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:33.574
You do, I think
you're so talented, Laura.

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:35.042
And I think others
will see that, too.

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:37.645
So I put a bunch of these up
all over town,

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.914
because your photos
are exciting, Laura.

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:43.751
You are exciting
and you excite me.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:47.888
It's so... this is so sweet.

forget an anniversary,

or birthday,
or to put the toilet seat down.

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:58.099
Nada. Because I'll be too
excited to be by your side.

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:02.770
That's the cheesiest thing
you've ever said.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:04.538
It's really cheesy, isn't it?

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:07.942
I had a gut instinct about it,
but I've been practicing it, so.

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.111
Cheesy is good.

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:14.649
You inspire me.

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:17.017
I'm your Beatrice.

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:19.053
No, you're my Laura,

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:22.824
and I'm not going to make
the same mistake Dante did.

01:14:57.159 --> 01:15:00.227
"Kind words can be short
and easy to speak,

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:03.998
but their echoes are
truly endless."

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:06.967
What the fuck
does that mean?

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:11.038
"Get close to your customers.
So close that you tell them what

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:14.609
they need well before they
realize it themselves."

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:19.013
Fuck that.

01:15:19.048 --> 01:15:23.951
"The best way to find yourself,
is to lose yourself
in the service of others."

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:30.157
That's like some
fucking rehab shit.

01:15:57.386 --> 01:16:00.087
You know, internet dating
isn't for everyone.

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:03.290
It was not for me
or for us really.

01:16:03.325 --> 01:16:05.292
But it works for
a lot of people. Right?

01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.627
Mm-hm. Yeah, it does.

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:09.930
I think there
is some value to it.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:12.967
I learned important lessons
doing it

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:16.637
and I guess, in a way,
it brought me to you.

01:16:17.272 --> 01:16:18.973
Really? Hmm.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:22.776
My name is Jim and
I am looking for a rich woman,

01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:25.179
who could take care of me.

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:28.282
But she doesn't have to be rich,
if she's Asian.

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:31.251
I really...
my mother died in childbirth,

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:34.355
so I would love to meet a man

01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:36.256
who has a really strong
relationship with his mother,

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:38.158
because I'd love a mom.

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:40.094
I like to stay in shape.

01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:41.795
I like to make a little cash.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:42.829
I like to wheel and deal

01:16:42.865 --> 01:16:46.033
and dammit I think I got
a lot going on over here.

01:16:46.068 --> 01:16:48.268
I don't know
why I'm still single.

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:54.341
My name is Yovanka and I am
single and I am available.

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:59.713
Okay? I am a Scorpio
and I like to fuck.

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:04.118
I wonder sometimes am I talking
to a woman right now?

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:08.922
Or am I talking to
some guy in Russia?

01:17:08.957 --> 01:17:13.060
I think it's been a while
since I've done this, and I...

01:17:13.095 --> 01:17:14.662
Oh.

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:18.065
Uh...
[clears throat]

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:20.401
I'm dating online because
everybody I meet is a douchebag.

01:17:20.436 --> 01:17:23.904
Like, um, fat women

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:27.908
or women
with mental disabilities.

01:17:27.943 --> 01:17:31.111
I'm looking for guys that are
really fun, super cool.

01:17:31.146 --> 01:17:34.048
Um, great body.
[chuckles]

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:35.849
Hinana!

01:17:35.884 --> 01:17:42.222
We are looking for a...
feline friendly guy.

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:43.523
[chuckles]

01:17:43.559 --> 01:17:47.761
And preferably someone
who likes to sing,
because we love to sing!

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.063
Don't we, Pickles?

01:17:49.098 --> 01:17:51.732
So, here's what we sing.
Let's sing our song.

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:56.236
<i>♪ We love the mouse
who lives in the kitchen ♪</i>

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:59.339
I feel like it's hard
to function in life,

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:03.877
because every time I just
go to the store, or I'm driving.

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:06.880
I'm like: is that person next
to me going to break my heart?

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:10.184
This person cashing me out
at the grocery store,

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:12.352
are they gonna
break my heart again?

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:16.090
So I'm looking to meet someone

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:17.891
who is not going
to do that to me.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:21.995
I believe that many times
you come into loves and so,

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:25.099
even though I don't know
where he is, okay?

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:27.067
I still can love him from afar.

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:29.436
It's like, you love apples
and you love bananas, okay?

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.838
I can love them both.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:32.239
I will find love again,

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:34.174
especially if guys
have big bananas.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.210
I do believe in soul mates.

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:38.846
I think that's, um, again,
that's probably why

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:42.015
I haven't found exactly
what I'm looking for yet.

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:44.084
Uh, cause I feel like
when it happens,
it's gonna be like...

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:45.252
[makes exploding sound]

01:18:45.287 --> 01:18:50.090
And in a woman?
A... girl?

01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:52.126
A woman? A woman...

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:57.998
I... I have to say,
she'll have to be very young.

01:18:58.033 --> 01:18:59.833
Um...

01:18:59.868 --> 01:19:04.238
Find this wonderful girl,
her name's Trish,

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:06.140
or something
beautiful like that,

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:11.178
and, and she's, you know,
black hair, raven.

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:14.214
And then you get there and she
doesn't have any teeth

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:16.517
or no arms and she's really fat.

01:19:16.552 --> 01:19:18.952
I don't like ethnic guys.

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:21.321
Not to be racist or anything,

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:27.060
but psychologically they say
we like people
that look like ourselves.

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:30.197
So, technically,
I'm not racist. [chuckles]

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:32.299
I just like people
that look like me.

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:36.270
Um, so,
I'm still a nice person.
[chuckles]

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:41.341
Yeah, I have been cheated on
and guess who, knock knock,
who's there?

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:44.845
I've cheated on people.
So eat a dick on that one.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.280
Cause it goes both ways.

01:19:46.315 --> 01:19:52.085
[as dummy] What is your
favorite sexual position?

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.389
[as himself]
That's awful forward, Woody.

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:58.358
Yeah, I liked to get spanked.
Hard.

01:19:58.393 --> 01:20:00.427
There's some things
I do not do, okay!

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:03.197
[speaking foreign language]

01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:05.099
I do not fuck in the butt!

01:20:15.611 --> 01:20:20.180
I, personally, feel like we
would have gotten here sooner

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:23.283
had it not been for the whole
online dating thing probably.

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:24.585
- Probably.
- Yeah.

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:26.086
You're right.
That's a good point.

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:28.088
- But...
- Derailed a little bit.

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:31.091
- We're together now...
- Yes.

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:33.160
- ...and we're happy.
- We are.

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:36.463
Okay. That's enough.

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.298
Ow... Be happy.

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:40.467
- Let me make you happy.
- I'm so happy!

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:42.469
- Let me make you happy.
- I'm so happy!

01:20:42.504 --> 01:20:44.071
[muffled talking]

01:20:44.106 --> 01:20:46.173
Tell the people
how happy you are!
