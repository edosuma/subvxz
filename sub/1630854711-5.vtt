00:11.200 --> 00:15.080
<i>The French capital</i>
<i>hosts the second Grand Slam of the year.</i>

00:18.040 --> 00:19.600
<i>Welcome to Roland-Garros.</i>

00:23.200 --> 00:25.800
<i>The French Open is tough.</i>

00:26.720 --> 00:30.840
Because your body doesn't quite know
what it's about to face.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.640
<i>Over the past two decades,</i>
<i>there's been thousands of men and women</i>

00:36.720 --> 00:38.880
<i>who have come here</i>
<i>hoping to lift the crown.</i>

00:39.840 --> 00:44.800
<i>But since 2005 on the men's side,</i>
<i>there's just one that's dominated.</i>

00:45.640 --> 00:48.800
<i>The most successful</i>
<i>man in the tournament's history.</i>

00:48.880 --> 00:50.720
<i>The king of clay.</i>

00:51.600 --> 00:56.080
<i>The Spaniard, Rafael Nadal!</i>

01:00.080 --> 01:02.200
<i>Rafael Nadal steps out</i>

01:02.280 --> 01:05.920
<i>onto what has often been described</i>
<i>as his living room.</i>

01:07.280 --> 01:13.280
<i>His record here is phenomenal.</i>
<i>105 wins, only three losses.</i>

01:14.480 --> 01:18.280
<i>He comes here and he is</i>
<i>the embodiment of self-confidence.</i>

01:19.560 --> 01:22.760
I want absolutely no piece of Rafa
on a clay court.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.880
<i>Conversation has largely become,</i>

01:24.960 --> 01:29.160
"Who has the potential to stop Rafa?"
And the answer is, "Not many."

01:29.240 --> 01:30.760
You don't want to have Rafa.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.200
<i>There is no better mover on the surface.</i>

01:35.280 --> 01:38.760
<i>You watch Rafa on clay,</i>
<i>the sliding isn't an issue,</i>

01:38.840 --> 01:41.200
whereas someone like me,
who didn't grow up on the surface,

01:41.280 --> 01:43.360
I look like an elephant on roller skates.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.640
I always say that you don't win
a Grand Slam with your tennis.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.480
You win a Grand Slam with your heart.

01:48.560 --> 01:51.520
<i>To try to beat</i>
<i>Rafael Nadal at Roland-Garros</i>

01:51.600 --> 01:54.320
<i>continues to be</i>
<i>the toughest ask in tennis.</i>

01:55.280 --> 01:58.720
I mean, just grit and perseverance.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.040
<i>Forget about just tennis.</i>

02:01.120 --> 02:03.440
<i>Is there a harder thing to do in all</i>
<i>of sports?</i>

02:20.280 --> 02:23.840
Sascha was in here earlier and
said, just watching you on these courts,

02:23.920 --> 02:28.080
he felt like your ball was coming off
your racket at 20 miles an hour faster

02:28.160 --> 02:31.960
and that you're a 30% better player here
than almost anywhere else.

02:32.040 --> 02:35.920
30% better player here than in the rest
of places or the rest of the players?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.280
-No…

02:40.200 --> 02:41.800
That would be nice.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.120
-Actually, I was for a while, but…

02:46.200 --> 02:47.640
Not anymore, I think.

02:47.720 --> 02:51.480
In the sport, things can change quick,

02:51.560 --> 02:55.080
and the only thing
that I can do is try to be ready.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.440
Stay on that line.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.840
-Second mark for me.
-Yeah.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.040
<i>I'm Félix Auger-Aliassime.</i>

03:09.120 --> 03:11.840
I'm 21 years old.
I'm from Montreal, Canada.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.080
Three, two, one, action.

03:15.680 --> 03:19.360
<i>The expectation on Félix</i>
<i>has always been very high.</i>

03:19.440 --> 03:23.720
Even when he was 12, he was already seen
like one of the best players in the world.

03:24.280 --> 03:29.360
<i>At 14 he's become the</i>
<i>youngest player to get a world ranking.</i>

03:30.720 --> 03:34.320
<i>Félix Auger-Aliassime, at just 18,</i>

03:34.400 --> 03:37.800
<i>is the youngest ever ATP 500 finalist.</i>

03:38.800 --> 03:40.240
And action.

03:41.200 --> 03:45.120
The big dream's to be number one
in the world, win Grand Slams.

03:46.640 --> 03:50.040
<i>As a kid, you saw it on TV,</i>
<i>but it was like a movie.</i>

03:51.200 --> 03:54.000
Now it's more of a reality, an objective.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.440
Last one, guys.

03:55.520 --> 03:58.400
-I love the challenge.
-I want you to look at me.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.560
Lately, Félix has proven that he could be
neck-to-neck with the best in the world.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.520
<i>He did that in Rome with Djokovic.</i>

04:07.120 --> 04:12.120
-<i>No way has he made that!</i>
-<i>He didn't have a chance.</i>

04:12.200 --> 04:14.320
With Medvédev in Australia.

04:17.640 --> 04:20.800
<i>He's unplayable</i>
<i>at the moment. Untouchable.</i>

04:20.880 --> 04:23.320
<i>Flawless from Auger-Aliassime.</i>

04:23.399 --> 04:25.480
Three, two, one. Action.

04:26.839 --> 04:30.560
<i>Félix is a tennis prodigy.</i>
<i>But, you know, he's 21 now.</i>

04:31.640 --> 04:35.040
<i>He hasn't won a big tournament yet.</i>
<i>He hasn't won a Grand Slam.</i>

04:35.840 --> 04:38.520
-Love it. Felix, thank you.
-Thank you, everybody.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.280
So he needs to find something
to take him to the next level.

04:48.280 --> 04:51.760
Thanks, Toni,
for all the moments you've given us.

04:53.240 --> 04:57.280
<i>Couple of bits of news</i>
<i>have taken place away from the court</i>

04:57.360 --> 05:01.560
<i>is that Félix Auger-Aliassime is going</i>
<i>to be coached by Toni Nadal.</i>

05:01.640 --> 05:03.800
Just one second.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.840
Let's go.

05:06.920 --> 05:09.400
Hello, my name is Toni Nadal.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.800
Any relation?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.920
I am Rafael Nadal's uncle.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.560
I was his coach
and now I am Rafael Nadal's uncle.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.800
You're a legend.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.800
<i>I felt like I was at an age</i>
<i>where I could expand my team.</i>

05:26.560 --> 05:30.840
<i>I wanted to work with somebody who</i>
<i>had gone to the highest peaks in tennis.</i>

05:30.920 --> 05:33.480
<i>The first name we thought of was Toni.</i>

05:34.520 --> 05:39.760
Toni brings that expertise
that no other coaches on tour have.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.080
-Can I take a picture, please?
-Yes.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.400
<i>He won 16 Grand Slams with Rafa.</i>

05:44.480 --> 05:45.680
Thank you <i>.</i>

05:50.400 --> 05:51.600
<i>Game, Nadal.</i>

05:54.640 --> 05:56.600
<i>Game, second set, Nadal.</i>

05:57.280 --> 05:59.520
I want to say thank you very much
for everything.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.240
<i>Especially for my uncle. He's my coach.</i>

06:03.360 --> 06:06.840
<i>I started working with Rafael</i>
<i>when he was three years old.</i>

06:07.480 --> 06:10.280
I always thought
he would be a great player.

06:10.360 --> 06:14.360
I never imagined
that he would win so many Grand Slams.

06:18.920 --> 06:23.600
Toni Nadal's not going to be interested in
coaching someone for shits and giggles,

06:24.160 --> 06:26.320
<i>so if he decides has does have</i>
<i>an interest in you,</i>

06:26.400 --> 06:29.840
that's a very big confidence boost
right away.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.800
<i>You know what I'd say to Rafael?</i>

06:42.880 --> 06:45.920
When he's paying, I tell him,
"Don't go looking for a winner.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.520
It'll come on its own."

06:47.600 --> 06:49.160
<i>My style is very simple.</i>

06:49.880 --> 06:53.640
The harder you work,
the more chances you have to succeed.

06:53.720 --> 06:57.840
<i>The first thing is working with people</i>
<i>that respect you.</i>

06:57.920 --> 07:01.560
<i>I could never train someone</i>
<i>who doesn't respect me.</i>

07:01.640 --> 07:03.800
So, a bit like a father then?

07:03.880 --> 07:08.480
Yes, in the end, I can't train someone

07:08.560 --> 07:11.400
who I don't appreciate greatly.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.160
<i>Since one year,</i>
<i>we are lucky to have Toni Nadal.</i>

07:19.240 --> 07:23.560
It was important to have external eyes
and external experience.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.320
<i>Going to Toni was trying</i>
<i>to have somebody from the outside.</i>

07:28.400 --> 07:32.240
<i>Somebody who was not close to me</i>
<i>at the time</i>

07:32.320 --> 07:36.520
and could challenge me and tell me
even things that I don't want to hear.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.520
<i>He's playing much better</i>
<i>than last year.</i>

07:39.600 --> 07:42.960
-Yeah, on clay he is.
-He was dreadful last year.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.000
Ah, shame.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.520
It's fine. Go again.

07:51.640 --> 07:55.000
The winner will come
if you strike the ball well.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.600
<i>There are a lot of coaches who say</i>

07:59.680 --> 08:03.000
<i>we should always say</i>
<i>pleasant thing to the players.</i>

08:03.080 --> 08:06.680
<i>But the reality is that</i>
<i>this creates people who are weak.</i>

08:06.760 --> 08:08.960
Try and find some good shots

08:09.800 --> 08:12.400
but without looking for something amazing.

08:12.480 --> 08:17.840
<i>I think Félix has one</i>
<i>of the best forehands in the world.</i>

08:18.440 --> 08:20.840
I think in the next few years,

08:20.920 --> 08:24.280
he is going to compete
to become number one.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.480
And he is going to win
Grand Slam tournaments.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.320
Thank you, have a nice day.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.840
<i>Casper Ruud has had</i>
<i>a fantastic start to the season.</i>

08:42.080 --> 08:46.000
<i>He's a clay-court specialist</i>
<i>who's modelled his game on Rafael Nadal.</i>

08:47.240 --> 08:50.240
<i>Some are saying this could be</i>
<i>his breakthrough tournament.</i>

08:53.400 --> 08:55.440
What should we do?
Headband on or off?

08:55.520 --> 08:57.400
I don't mind. You decide.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.160
I think let's go off.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.560
I'm Casper Ruud. I'm from Norway.
I'm a professional tennis player.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.080
Oh, ten!

09:22.320 --> 09:26.000
<i>When I started the year,</i>
<i>I was ranked number eight in the world.</i>

09:26.080 --> 09:29.200
And this week
I'm at a career-high number five.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.960
So it's a good week to be me, I guess.

09:37.920 --> 09:41.520
<i>It doesn't feel always too real</i>
<i>that I reach this far,</i>

09:41.600 --> 09:45.000
but I try to take it in and enjoy it,
of course, as much as I can.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.640
I love Casper Ruud. He's one of the people
who hasn't got enough hype.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.520
<i>He's not the person</i>
<i>who brings attention to himself.</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:02.400
<i>He's not a self-promoter.</i>

10:05.680 --> 10:10.640
It started with me watching tennis on TV
when I was about five, six years old.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.880
<i>That was</i>
<i>the first Grand Slam that Rafa won.</i>

10:20.120 --> 10:23.360
<i>When he won the Roland-Garros</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

10:23.440 --> 10:27.360
<i>I remember he had</i>
<i>a poster of Rafa in his bedroom.</i>

10:27.440 --> 10:31.760
He's been his hero since he was
seven or eight years old, I would say.

10:33.200 --> 10:37.880
<i>So, you know, when he started to play,</i>
<i>he kind of wanted to imitate Rafa.</i>

10:37.960 --> 10:39.560
<i>Of course, Rafa plays best on clay.</i>

10:39.640 --> 10:43.600
And, in a sense, that's why
Casper's game is suited best for clay.

10:45.880 --> 10:48.440
-How are you, man?
-Good to see you.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.880
<i>I joined the Rafa Nadal Academy in 2018.</i>

10:53.440 --> 10:57.600
<i>In my case, it was the perfect place</i>
<i>to find good practice partners.</i>

10:57.680 --> 11:00.960
<i>Learning from Rafa himself,</i>
<i>of course, and his coaches.</i>

11:01.040 --> 11:04.520
<i>The Rafael Nadal Academy</i>
<i>caters to younger players,</i>

11:04.600 --> 11:08.160
trying to basically
teach them the successful method

11:08.240 --> 11:11.400
that got Rafa Nadal to be where he is.

11:12.480 --> 11:14.800
<i>I'd practice with Rafa</i>
<i>sometimes if I was lucky</i>

11:14.880 --> 11:16.920
<i>and he asked me to practice.</i>

11:17.000 --> 11:22.040
<i>He'd even pop into our evening practices</i>
<i>to see how we were doing,</i>

11:22.600 --> 11:26.440
<i>coming with advice and helping us.</i>

11:26.520 --> 11:27.440
Play again.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.680
<i>The goal this year for me is to reach</i>
<i>a quarterfinal of a Grand Slam.</i>

11:33.760 --> 11:35.680
<i>I still haven't been able to do it.</i>

11:35.760 --> 11:39.760
<i>I think that Roland-Garros</i>
<i>is the coolest slam.</i>

11:39.840 --> 11:44.320
I feel my chances are maybe a little bit
better than others because of the surface.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.640
So it would mean
a lot to do it here for me.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.080
Yeah, we are.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.000
Shall I be the head of the table?

11:54.880 --> 11:57.680
Great. Here. It's mine, yeah.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.040
-Thank you.
-I'll try not to stain my shirt.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.160
No mistakes allowed. You're wearing white.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.160
I always say and I believe it,
I don't remember

12:10.320 --> 12:12.680
a day when tennis wasn't in my life.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.920
Not only something in my life,
the most important thing in my life.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.320
My earliest memories,

12:18.400 --> 12:22.200
my sister and I were in elementary school
and finished at three.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.760
We'd spend the rest of the day
at the tennis club.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.400
It was like a playground.
I broke a few rackets there.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.760
-When was the last time you beat him?
-She never beat me.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.600
No.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.840
I recall we were, like,
almost the same level

12:35.920 --> 12:38.320
until he went to the National Center.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.880
So, let's say, uh…

12:39.960 --> 12:43.080
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.

12:46.680 --> 12:49.040
No, I'm saying the first time.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.440
I'm not saying at 15.
See how defensive he is?

12:52.520 --> 12:54.160
A bit of competition.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.440
I always remember my dad saying,

12:56.520 --> 13:00.560
"You need to eat tennis, to drink tennis,
to sleep tennis, to shit tennis."

13:00.640 --> 13:02.960
It always made me laugh.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.960
<i>My dad was a tennis coach all his life.</i>

13:10.200 --> 13:12.080
<i>Tennis was his biggest passion.</i>

13:13.760 --> 13:17.640
He was very, very demanding
with me and my sister.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.480
The discipline, the respect
was the highest of priorities.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.320
<i>My dad always had this mentality</i>
<i>of trying to prepare myself</i>

13:28.400 --> 13:31.280
<i>for what's to come</i>
<i>if I want to be a professional player.</i>

13:34.200 --> 13:39.360
I don't like to talk about sacrifice,
because for me, it's choices.

13:39.440 --> 13:45.600
Uh, but Félix has to make a lot
of choices for his future career.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.760
At six, I played my first tournament.
I came to the tournament in like a…

13:49.840 --> 13:53.600
full football jersey outfit,
to a tennis tournament.

13:53.680 --> 13:54.640
Makes no sense.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.600
<i>He began to travel so young.</i>

13:56.680 --> 14:00.560
The first time he took a plane alone
he was nine years old.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.880
And for me, at that time, I cried.

14:02.960 --> 14:08.560
I can tell you that, for me it was,
I said he's too young.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.600
It's come too fast.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.840
<i>Félix always traveling around the world,</i>

14:16.920 --> 14:19.840
<i>does not get a lot of opportunities</i>
<i>to see friends and family.</i>

14:19.920 --> 14:22.600
<i>That's why we wanted</i>
<i>to do something special.</i>

14:26.000 --> 14:27.760
This is the surprise.

14:27.840 --> 14:28.960
Everyone's here.

14:29.040 --> 14:32.520
<i>To be honest, this is a life</i>
<i>that is not meant for everybody.</i>

14:32.600 --> 14:35.000
<i>You need to be dedicated.</i>

14:35.080 --> 14:38.640
There is no way that you can
have time off.

14:39.240 --> 14:41.120
This is superb.

14:41.200 --> 14:45.720
I must prepare
for the tournament and I have lots to do.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.960
So I always wonder
when I'll see my friends and family.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.600
<i>A lot of people tell me,</i>

14:51.680 --> 14:55.920
<i>"You should be very proud of your son</i>
<i>and what he's doing."</i>

14:56.000 --> 14:58.120
For me, I didn't raise a tennis player.

14:58.200 --> 15:04.720
I raised a child who I expect to become
a man, you know, with good values.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.720
I'm proud of the man he is.

15:19.760 --> 15:24.560
<i>Auger-Aliassime is probably</i>
<i>a little nervous, don't you think?</i>

15:24.640 --> 15:28.080
<i>Success at Roland-Garros hasn't really</i>
<i>been something he's tasted before.</i>

15:34.480 --> 15:38.320
<i>I enter every tournament knowing</i>
<i>that potentially I could win.</i>

15:38.400 --> 15:42.360
<i>But I was coming in never having won</i>
<i>a match at the French Open.</i>

15:42.440 --> 15:47.520
There's sometimes a little bit
of uncertainty and doubts that creep in.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.760
There are moments during matches where,

15:49.840 --> 15:53.600
I don't know about you,
but I know Rafael gets nervous.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.240
Do you normally get nervous
before going out?

15:56.840 --> 15:58.920
I'm alright.
During the first few days.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.560
It's good stress.

16:01.640 --> 16:07.440
There are moments where I look at Rafa
and I can see that he's crying.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.760
I prefer to be on the court.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.920
<i>Félix Auger-Aliassime.</i>

16:17.280 --> 16:21.520
<i>What I can bring to Félix</i>
<i>is my experience.</i>

16:22.440 --> 16:26.200
A person's main talent in life
is the capacity to learn.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.560
<i>With what I say, I think he can succeed.</i>

16:35.600 --> 16:37.080
Come on!

16:37.160 --> 16:40.960
<i>What I like about Toni's approach</i>
<i>is the belief, the confidence.</i>

16:41.680 --> 16:44.000
<i>He's looking more aggressive.</i>

16:44.080 --> 16:45.880
He brings a lot into my team.

16:45.960 --> 16:50.120
<i>If we do things well,</i>
<i>then good things will come.</i>

16:52.680 --> 16:56.200
-<i>He's done it.</i>
-<i>Set and match, Auger-Aliassime.</i>

17:08.800 --> 17:12.640
<i>The Norwegian Casper Ruud</i>
<i>is showing his form on the clay.</i>

17:16.079 --> 17:18.880
<i>And his side of the draw</i>
<i>has really opened up.</i>

17:19.520 --> 17:22.960
<i>I mean, it's obvious that</i>
<i>one side looks stronger than the other.</i>

17:23.040 --> 17:25.800
This is the time.
This is the moment to step up.

17:29.680 --> 17:33.119
<i>Félix Auger-Aliassime</i>
<i>in on the tough side of the draw.</i>

17:41.520 --> 17:44.360
<i>He could face</i>
<i>Toni Nadal's nephew, Rafa,</i>

17:44.440 --> 17:47.720
<i>in the next round,</i>
<i>if both men win their matches today.</i>

17:56.360 --> 17:58.800
<i>Game, set and match, Auger-Aliassime.</i>

17:58.880 --> 18:02.600
<i>Three sets to love. 7-6, 7-6, 7-5.</i>

18:08.960 --> 18:10.320
Bravo, Félix.

18:13.280 --> 18:14.920
How's Rafa getting on?

18:15.000 --> 18:17.720
He's not won yet.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.920
<i>He's done it.</i>

18:27.000 --> 18:30.480
<i>Rafael Nadal seals his spot</i>
<i>in the last 16.</i>

18:33.480 --> 18:37.200
<i>He'll now go into battle</i>
<i>against Félix Auger-Aliassime,</i>

18:37.280 --> 18:39.120
<i>who has uncle Toni in his team.</i>

18:39.200 --> 18:42.360
<i>It's sure to make things awkward</i>
<i>for everyone involved.</i>

18:43.800 --> 18:46.880
Toni Nadal is now working with you
in the Grand Slam.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.520
Will he be in the box?

18:49.600 --> 18:52.720
Will he be able
to help you tactically or not at all?

18:52.800 --> 18:55.720
We haven't spoken much about this yet.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.480
Thank you.

18:57.560 --> 19:01.160
Hi, Rafa.
Obviously your uncle is coaching Félix.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.560
Will it be awkward for you when you play?

19:03.640 --> 19:06.320
I knew that you were going to ask me…

19:06.400 --> 19:08.640
That you guys were going to ask
the question.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.960
For me, it's very simple.

19:12.040 --> 19:16.320
He's my uncle.
I don't think, uh, he will be able to…

19:19.440 --> 19:21.920
to want me to lose, without a doubt.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.360
But he's a professional.
He's with another player.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.560
I don't know what's going to happen,
if he's going to stay in the box or not.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.040
But I don't care.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.680
I know the feelings we have
between each other.

19:32.440 --> 19:37.320
I know he wants the best for me
and now he's helping another player.

19:40.120 --> 19:43.600
What is dangerous is that you can't use
the inside line too soon.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.600
-You have to make him move…
-Very good.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.400
Good match. You played well.

19:52.840 --> 19:57.840
But you lost your concentration once
at the start of the third set.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.280
You could say I've got a lot more to come.

20:05.560 --> 20:08.840
-Tomorrow against Rafael on court 14.
-Yeah.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.960
<i>I think that, for Félix,</i>
<i>you want to be able to look courtside.</i>

20:23.040 --> 20:26.880
You want to know that your coach
is literally in your box, in your corner.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.760
<i>You commit with a player.</i>

20:30.840 --> 20:33.000
It's a professional commitment.

20:33.080 --> 20:37.480
The professional commitment says,
"I'm going to be with you 100%."

20:37.560 --> 20:38.920
"100%."

20:39.000 --> 20:43.680
"And I'm going to do everything
to help you be the best you can."

20:43.760 --> 20:47.440
"That's my job and my role.
I take it more than seriously."

20:54.080 --> 20:57.400
How will you support Félix
before this match?

20:58.160 --> 21:01.080
I can't really say much,

21:01.680 --> 21:06.280
I can't really tell Félix
how to beat Rafael.

21:06.360 --> 21:11.160
To tell the truth,
I want my nephew to win.

21:12.120 --> 21:17.000
He's my nephew
and he's more than a nephew to me.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.560
I want my nephew to win.

21:28.640 --> 21:33.360
<i>Uncle Toni</i>
<i>gave interviews explicitly saying,</i>

21:34.200 --> 21:39.360
<i>"Okay, Félix is my guy that pays me,</i>
<i>but I'm supporting Rafa today."</i>

21:39.440 --> 21:43.080
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>he said that. I can't believe it.</i>

21:43.160 --> 21:46.800
<i>I would be surprised</i>
<i>if that relationship survives this.</i>

21:46.880 --> 21:48.840
You're doing great
with Félix.

21:50.440 --> 21:54.960
That's his choice, to say that he would
prefer Rafa to win than his player.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.360
That's his choice. Would I do that?
No, I'd never do that.

22:00.640 --> 22:04.240
<i>I have my principles</i>
<i>and my principles are my own.</i>

22:04.920 --> 22:06.840
<i>I won't change them.</i>

22:14.120 --> 22:16.760
Hey, how are you doing?

22:16.840 --> 22:19.800
Félix is in the other corner.
Are you allowed to be on this side?

22:19.880 --> 22:21.320
Yeah, I mean…

22:23.280 --> 22:24.800
Come on.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.080
<i>He said he won't sit in either box.</i>

22:28.160 --> 22:33.240
<i>Sure. But does he</i>
<i>withhold his coaching expertise?</i>

22:33.320 --> 22:35.120
<i>Who's he cheering for?</i>

22:35.200 --> 22:37.320
<i>If I'm Félix, I'll always have in my head,</i>

22:37.400 --> 22:39.840
<i>"I wonder what I've left on the table</i>
<i>by not knowing</i>

22:39.920 --> 22:43.240
<i>what Toni Nadal thinks</i>
<i>I should have done to beat his nephew."</i>

22:58.240 --> 22:59.520
<i>It was clear to me,</i>

22:59.600 --> 23:02.400
<i>once we started working together,</i>
<i>that if I had to play Rafa,</i>

23:02.480 --> 23:06.600
he wouldn't want me to win.
He wouldn't want me to beat his nephew.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.400
<i>We respect the fact that it's family.</i>

23:12.480 --> 23:15.960
He doesn't want to put himself
in conflict of interest. It's all good.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.240
<i>For us, it was understood.</i>

23:20.840 --> 23:23.600
To win at this level,
the biggest challenge

23:24.320 --> 23:27.120
is always to try and beat
someone like Nadal here.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.320
But you must believe in yourself.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.640
You must believe you can beat the best.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.800
It's such a good idea
to watch matches where he wins.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.440
I'm not kidding.

23:54.480 --> 23:55.760
Yeah, I guess so.

23:56.600 --> 24:00.320
My father always challenged me.
He also has that competitive mindset.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.760
So I think I inherited it from him.

24:04.920 --> 24:07.920
I played professional for about ten years.

24:08.000 --> 24:11.520
And I reached ranking of 39,
which I was happy with.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.080
<i>Game, Ruud.</i>

24:15.160 --> 24:17.680
That was the number to beat for me
when I grew up.

24:18.840 --> 24:23.720
I'm surprised he beat my ranking that easy
because it's a tough sport.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.000
Perfect.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.600
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.480
<i>Everything in tennis</i>
<i>is very based on routines</i>

24:37.560 --> 24:39.600
<i>that we want to stick to.</i>

24:39.680 --> 24:41.480
<i>When you're that far in a tournament,</i>

24:41.560 --> 24:44.520
<i>all you need is 15 minutes</i>
<i>just to feel the ball a little bit.</i>

24:45.480 --> 24:49.640
<i>When that routine is completely broken,</i>
<i>it can set us off.</i>

25:01.600 --> 25:04.720
It's not us,
it's the boss. He said to do it.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.120
Why are you not speaking English to me?
Do you think I know French?

25:08.200 --> 25:11.040
I spoke with the boss, he said no.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.560
The rain's coming now, look.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.880
Does the boss speak English?

25:15.960 --> 25:17.800
He doesn't speak English.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.360
Who's in charge?
We lost ten minutes that we could play.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.640
This guy wants to have the covers
when it's not raining.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.280
If it starts to rain, yes,
take the covers, just like in a match.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.680
If it starts to rain,
you put the cover on.

25:30.760 --> 25:35.920
I think the biggest advantage
of being also the dad and the coach is

25:36.000 --> 25:41.520
you give 110% because, of course,
everyone wants their children to succeed.

25:41.600 --> 25:44.240
First, he decides Casper can't play
without rain.

25:44.320 --> 25:47.360
If we want to play in the drizzle,
we want to play in the drizzle.

25:48.440 --> 25:49.760
We are here for you, but…

25:49.840 --> 25:53.760
You have the best clay courts
in the world. They can take some water.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.160
We asked the chief…

25:55.240 --> 25:58.000
But the chief is not here,
so how can you know?

25:58.080 --> 26:01.240
He's probably inside saying,
"It's going to rain. You have to stop."

26:01.320 --> 26:03.760
You're here and you understand
this is not much rain.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.480
We have to follow orders.
We are paid to do that.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.800
Then you should have told them
to come here.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.680
Who is more important? Him or the players?
We're the ones playing the tournament.

26:12.760 --> 26:16.480
-Who's going to play the match? Him or me?
-I have to follow orders.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.480
Yes, but what about our request?

26:19.880 --> 26:22.920
It's unbelievable. We could have
played already for 15 minutes.

26:37.400 --> 26:41.440
<i>Today's big match</i>
<i>is billed as the "Uncle Toni Derby."</i>

26:41.520 --> 26:44.560
<i>Thirteen-time Roland-Garros winner,</i>
<i>Rafael Nadal,</i>

26:44.640 --> 26:47.760
<i>who, for so long,</i>
<i>was coached by his uncle,</i>

26:47.840 --> 26:52.880
<i>is going head-to-head with Félix,</i>
<i>who now has Uncle Toni on his team.</i>

26:54.880 --> 26:59.520
All my life,
I had to help Rafael win a few matches.

26:59.600 --> 27:04.520
And now… unfortunately, I've helped
someone who can defeat my nephew.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.080
It's a bit complicated.

27:09.040 --> 27:12.840
<i>I'm just young in my career,</i>
<i>trying to be the best player I can be.</i>

27:13.800 --> 27:14.960
Trying to be a champion.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.960
Winning a Grand Slam
means everything to me.

27:19.040 --> 27:22.200
<i>It's something I've been chasing</i>
<i>for as early as I can remember.</i>

27:22.880 --> 27:26.120
So to play in center court,
in his house, on his court…

27:26.840 --> 27:29.200
Being the underdog. Proving people wrong.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.800
<i>That I could challenge him.</i>
<i>That I could maybe win.</i>

27:32.560 --> 27:34.760
It's a cool position to be in.

27:47.440 --> 27:53.280
To get in the zone, you have to be in
this state that's very stable and focused.

28:11.680 --> 28:16.960
<i>Him jumping around and warming up,</i>
<i>running up and down next to you…</i>

28:18.120 --> 28:19.720
It does turn up the intensity.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.520
<i>He is 21, a semi-finalist</i>

28:31.600 --> 28:34.080
<i>at the US Open last year</i>
<i>and he is Canadian:</i>

28:34.160 --> 28:37.240
<i>Félix Auger-Aliassime!</i>

28:40.720 --> 28:43.920
<i>The demands on these players are enormous.</i>

28:44.000 --> 28:49.600
<i>You need an incredible level of physical,</i>
<i>mental and emotional strength.</i>

28:51.040 --> 28:54.480
<i>So I have a lot of admiration for my son.</i>

28:54.560 --> 28:58.680
<i>From Spain, Rafael Nadal!</i>

28:58.760 --> 29:03.600
<i>The 13-time Roland-Garros</i>
<i>champion, Rafael Nadal, steps out.</i>

29:03.680 --> 29:06.440
<i>It's the Uncle Toni Derby.</i>

29:07.240 --> 29:10.360
<i>But he has said he won't be</i>
<i>in either player's box.</i>

29:11.720 --> 29:13.320
<i>Toni being there…</i>

29:13.400 --> 29:18.000
<i>I like him as a person. I respect him.</i>
<i>I was glad to see him there watching.</i>

29:18.840 --> 29:20.720
<i>Félix Auger-Aliassime</i>

29:20.800 --> 29:23.120
<i>is surely going to have</i>
<i>to take it to another level today</i>

29:23.200 --> 29:25.360
<i>to take on Rafael Nadal.</i>

29:28.400 --> 29:31.200
<i>Once the match started,</i>
<i>tactically-thinking like,</i>

29:31.280 --> 29:33.200
<i>I can't let him run me around.</i>

29:38.120 --> 29:40.520
<i>I can't let him dominate.</i>

29:42.000 --> 29:45.360
<i>What a get</i>
<i>for Félix Auger-Aliassime.</i>

29:45.440 --> 29:47.120
<i>That was Michael Jordan-esque.</i>

29:47.200 --> 29:49.080
<i>He leads four-one.</i>

29:49.160 --> 29:51.600
<i>When you're in the zone,</i>
<i>you're able to execute everything</i>

29:51.680 --> 29:53.200
<i>the way you want it.</i>

29:53.840 --> 29:54.920
<i>It's a great feeling.</i>

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
<i>Simply sensational</i>
<i>from the world number nine.</i>

29:58.080 --> 29:59.680
<i>Set point.</i>

30:02.240 --> 30:03.600
<i>-Oh, yes.</i>

30:03.680 --> 30:06.600
<i>Félix Auger-Aliassime takes the first set.</i>

30:07.160 --> 30:09.280
<i>Things are going the way of the underdog.</i>

30:09.360 --> 30:12.360
<i>But still a long, long way left to go.</i>

30:21.080 --> 30:23.320
<i>What a point from Rafa.</i>

30:28.360 --> 30:31.040
<i>I felt the momentum change.</i>

30:35.160 --> 30:37.360
<i>Nadal takes the second set.</i>

30:38.200 --> 30:42.240
<i>Feels as though Aliassime</i>
<i>has mentally sunk a little bit.</i>

30:43.760 --> 30:46.880
<i>He started hitting much faster,</i>
<i>much stronger…</i>

30:50.200 --> 30:51.480
<i>He went up a gear.</i>

30:51.560 --> 30:53.880
<i>Now dominating this encounter.</i>

30:55.240 --> 30:56.760
<i>He takes the third set.</i>

31:04.040 --> 31:08.720
<i>Toni Nadal.</i>
<i>I wonder how he's feeling right now.</i>

31:09.960 --> 31:12.560
<i>I have to try, at least,</i>
<i>to impose myself.</i>

31:14.280 --> 31:15.560
<i>Serve really well.</i>

31:16.440 --> 31:19.120
<i>Take every opportunity I can</i>
<i>to dominate the rally</i>

31:19.200 --> 31:21.400
<i>and be very aggressive.</i>

31:21.480 --> 31:23.280
<i>Oh, magnificent.</i>

31:25.160 --> 31:27.840
<i>The athleticism of Auger-Aliassime…</i>

31:29.000 --> 31:33.800
<i>it's proving a problem for Rafa.</i>
<i>It's three set points.</i>

31:35.560 --> 31:36.760
<i>Pressure moment.</i>

31:41.280 --> 31:43.560
<i>How about that? He got his mojo back.</i>

31:44.720 --> 31:48.760
<i>It will be a one-set shootout</i>
<i>here on Chatrier.</i>

31:48.840 --> 31:53.520
<i>For just the third time in Nadal's career</i>
<i>here at Roland-Garros.</i>

31:54.520 --> 31:59.920
<i>Nadal has only been taken to five sets</i>
<i>twice before in these championships.</i>

32:02.840 --> 32:06.240
<i>It became a difficult situation for me.</i>

32:07.320 --> 32:09.720
<i>And I left the court.</i>

32:11.960 --> 32:13.800
<i>I preferred not to watch.</i>

32:13.880 --> 32:18.080
<i>This is going to be</i>
<i>tightly played out.</i>

32:19.760 --> 32:21.400
<i>Listen to the noise.</i>

32:22.480 --> 32:25.880
<i>After four hours,</i>
<i>it's about surviving.</i>

32:28.560 --> 32:30.600
<i>Auger-Aliassime continues to hold his own.</i>

32:30.680 --> 32:33.160
<i>And then he just hit like, boom.</i>

32:34.320 --> 32:37.400
<i>Boom. And then, boom again.</i>

32:37.960 --> 32:42.120
<i>I find myself break points down</i>
<i>and now having the pressure on me.</i>

32:42.840 --> 32:44.800
<i>Sensational.</i>

32:47.400 --> 32:50.680
-<i>He just went into another gear.</i>
-<i>Match point.</i>

32:56.760 --> 32:59.320
<i>Rafael Nadal survives.</i>

33:02.360 --> 33:05.360
<i>Wonderful sportsmanship</i>
<i>from Auger-Aliassime,</i>

33:05.440 --> 33:07.920
<i>who can take so much</i>

33:08.000 --> 33:11.800
<i>from being just</i>
<i>the third player in history</i>

33:11.880 --> 33:15.800
<i>to take Nadal to five sets</i>
<i>here at Roland-Garros.</i>

33:23.360 --> 33:26.400
<i>I think Félix found it difficult</i>
<i>when he lost.</i>

33:28.520 --> 33:31.360
<i>But I know that he will find his way.</i>

33:44.280 --> 33:45.800
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:48.920 --> 33:53.200
Toni, that was a special match for you.
How did you feel during this game?

33:53.280 --> 33:55.400
Well, it's been difficult.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.200
Félix has very big potential.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.800
With a little bit more,
he can defeat my nephew.

34:10.640 --> 34:13.840
Of course, it's emotionally loaded for me,
for everyone.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.480
It's okay. It's not huge.

34:18.639 --> 34:23.120
It also shows you're getting more
and more ready, if you see what I mean.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.960
-That's true.
-Each time.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.679
You'll be fighting again!

34:28.400 --> 34:31.440
I really believe in life
you get what you deserve.

34:31.520 --> 34:34.360
<i>I'm proud of what</i>
<i>I was able to show to the world.</i>

34:34.440 --> 34:38.480
<i>It gave me a lot of confidence</i>
<i>that I could challenge even the best.</i>

34:38.560 --> 34:40.400
<i>So I have even more belief.</i>

34:40.480 --> 34:42.800
So I was disappointed at the time,

34:42.880 --> 34:46.760
<i>but I feel like</i>
<i>I'm nowhere near my peak yet.</i>

34:46.840 --> 34:50.080
Hopefully my peak is in front of me.

34:50.159 --> 34:51.880
A present.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.400
Form yourself, to yourself.
They're the best presents.

34:56.480 --> 34:57.920
From me to me.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.120
Yeah. That's great.

35:07.920 --> 35:11.440
<i>Casper Ruud has been</i>
<i>playing the best tennis of his career.</i>

35:12.040 --> 35:15.840
<i>He not only reached his first</i>
<i>Grand Slam quarterfinal, he won it.</i>

35:20.720 --> 35:24.720
<i>Match point.</i>
<i>Ruud is serving for a place in the final.</i>

35:35.000 --> 35:38.160
<i>Casper will now play</i>
<i>his childhood hero, his idol,</i>

35:38.240 --> 35:41.480
<i>on Philippe-Chatrier at Roland-Garros.</i>

35:50.880 --> 35:54.040
<i>Playing Rafa in the final of a Grand Slam.</i>

35:54.120 --> 35:57.240
It's a difficult situation
because Rafa is his biggest idol.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.840
<i>I have been practicing with Rafa</i>

36:03.920 --> 36:06.800
for the last two or three years
at the academy, and he always…

36:06.880 --> 36:08.320
he always beats me in practice.

36:10.280 --> 36:13.560
<i>I will be the underdog.</i>
<i>I could probably tell you all the finals</i>

36:13.640 --> 36:16.080
<i>and who he's beaten</i>
<i>because I watched them all on TV.</i>

36:16.160 --> 36:19.640
So, I will try to, you know,
tonight and tomorrow night,

36:19.720 --> 36:23.360
dream about the great winners
and the unbelievable rallies.

36:23.440 --> 36:25.880
That's what it's going to take
if I want to have any chance.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.760
I'll need to play my best tennis ever.

36:29.360 --> 36:31.520
<i>But I still have to believe I can do it.</i>

36:43.200 --> 36:45.360
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.440
Can I have a selfie?

37:04.360 --> 37:06.560
<i>I actually slept better than I feared.</i>

37:08.480 --> 37:10.440
<i>You want to perform your best.</i>

37:11.880 --> 37:14.320
<i>This is the biggest match ever</i>
<i>for me in my career.</i>

37:25.880 --> 37:30.360
<i>It's tough to believe</i>
<i>that we can beat Rafa, Roger, and Novak.</i>

37:30.440 --> 37:36.200
<i>They've been dominating like no one almost</i>
<i>has ever dominated in sports before.</i>

37:36.960 --> 37:42.200
And especially when all three of them
have been idols of you growing up.

37:53.280 --> 37:57.400
<i>To play Rafa in a five sets</i>
<i>clay-court match, on that court…</i>

37:58.280 --> 38:00.640
It's the toughest challenge
we have in tennis, for sure.

38:03.320 --> 38:06.680
Okay.
Now it's all business.

38:07.640 --> 38:11.680
Get badass in your head. He fears you.

38:33.560 --> 38:36.880
<i>It was obviously a big match,</i>
<i>but I didn't want to think too much</i>

38:36.960 --> 38:39.840
<i>about the consequences</i>
<i>and what was waiting ahead.</i>

39:00.560 --> 39:03.040
-How long, more or less?
-Thirty seconds.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.240
<i>Warm applause for Casper Ruud.</i>

39:44.320 --> 39:47.760
<i>He's won a lot of fans here</i>
<i>with his passage through to the final.</i>

39:48.440 --> 39:52.400
<i>His father, his sister,</i>
<i>his mum there, his girlfriend as well.</i>

39:53.240 --> 39:56.520
<i>Thirteen-time winner</i>
<i>here at Roland-Garros.</i>

39:56.600 --> 39:59.480
<i>From Spain, Rafael Nadal!</i>

40:07.120 --> 40:10.200
<i>That roar when Rafa entered the arena…</i>

40:10.280 --> 40:13.280
<i>That starts to seep into your mindset.</i>

40:13.360 --> 40:17.120
Rafa! Rafa! Rafa!

40:21.720 --> 40:23.800
<i>I'm not going to play</i>
<i>a Grand Slam final</i>

40:23.880 --> 40:25.920
<i>every Sunday the rest of my life.</i>

40:27.000 --> 40:30.960
<i>So this might be the only one.</i>
<i>This might be the only chance I get.</i>

40:31.040 --> 40:32.600
<i>Here we go.</i>

40:32.680 --> 40:36.760
<i>The final of Roland-Garros 2022.</i>

40:46.200 --> 40:48.000
<i>Bound to be a few nerves.</i>

40:52.760 --> 40:53.960
<i>Hits that one wrong.</i>

41:00.120 --> 41:02.560
<i>Nearly taking out James Keothavong</i>
<i>with the return.</i>

41:02.640 --> 41:06.440
<i>But the umpire survives</i>
<i>as Nadal takes the opening set.</i>

41:09.960 --> 41:12.760
<i>You'd like to think</i>
<i>that there's always a chance.</i>

41:20.280 --> 41:22.000
<i>It's a rocket.</i>

41:22.080 --> 41:24.040
<i>You know, he's older than me.</i>

41:24.120 --> 41:27.000
<i>If there's ever a time</i>
<i>to actually beat him in a final,</i>

41:27.080 --> 41:29.640
<i>maybe today's a big opportunity.</i>

41:33.360 --> 41:35.200
<i>That's masterful.</i>

41:35.280 --> 41:38.920
<i>Casper Ruud opens up a three-one lead</i>
<i>in the second set.</i>

41:42.720 --> 41:44.720
<i>Nadal breaks back straight away.</i>

41:44.800 --> 41:47.800
<i>Ruud still in front.</i>
<i>Three-two, second set.</i>

41:52.520 --> 41:53.800
<i>Game, Nadal.</i>

41:56.880 --> 41:59.960
<i>Third game in a row</i>
<i>for the Spaniard. He can do no wrong.</i>

42:01.600 --> 42:03.920
<i>We always face tough situations,</i>

42:04.680 --> 42:07.000
<i>but I need to get a hold on this game.</i>

42:13.720 --> 42:17.680
<i>I mean, right now,</i>
<i>Ruud has lost this mental battle.</i>

42:20.600 --> 42:24.360
<i>His family and team</i>
<i>are still trying to show encouragement.</i>

42:25.800 --> 42:30.120
<i>It was not his best</i>
<i>tennis. He was not his best mentally.</i>

42:32.560 --> 42:35.000
<i>Championship point for Rafael Nadal.</i>

42:44.240 --> 42:48.160
<i>The greatest becomes even greater.</i>

42:52.160 --> 42:55.360
<i>I didn't really think</i>
<i>that I was… humiliated.</i>

42:57.600 --> 43:02.520
It's Rafa and it's on clay, so, I mean…
I did my best. What else can I do?

43:02.600 --> 43:05.240
It wasn't good enough. Wasn't even close.

43:08.320 --> 43:10.680
<i>I think that was a</i>
<i>fairy tale.</i>

43:10.760 --> 43:12.280
It was a final of a Grand Slam

43:12.360 --> 43:15.960
and he was playing
the best player on the planet.

43:16.520 --> 43:17.800
<i>Ever.</i>

43:17.880 --> 43:21.200
Rafael Nadal!

43:27.280 --> 43:31.280
<i>Everyone thinks that probably</i>
<i>every athlete has this champion mentality.</i>

43:31.360 --> 43:32.800
<i>But it's not always like that.</i>

43:38.520 --> 43:43.120
<i>Being from Norway, a small tennis country</i>
<i>where we don't have any big history,</i>

43:43.200 --> 43:46.960
<i>it's not always been easy to realize</i>
<i>that I can do it myself.</i>

43:47.040 --> 43:49.760
The hunger to win grows
even more when you lose the finals.

43:55.320 --> 43:58.400
<i>It is a 14th Roland-Garros title</i>

43:58.480 --> 44:01.440
<i>for the greatest player</i>
<i>this great tournament</i>

44:01.520 --> 44:04.480
<i>has ever seen and ever will see.</i>

44:06.640 --> 44:09.760
<i>A 22nd Grand Slam title.</i>

44:15.480 --> 44:17.160
<i>During the trophy ceremony,</i>

44:17.240 --> 44:20.680
<i>Rafa came up</i>
<i>and put his hand around my shoulders.</i>

44:20.760 --> 44:22.960
Of course it put a big smile on my face.

44:34.120 --> 44:37.480
<i>I will always have that silver plate</i>
<i>back home in my place</i>

44:37.560 --> 44:40.600
<i>and look at it</i>
<i>and be proud of what I achieved there.</i>

44:42.360 --> 44:45.760
I'll pray to God that I don't play
Rafa again in Roland-Garros

44:45.840 --> 44:49.600
because it's an impossible task
to beat him.

44:49.680 --> 44:51.720
<i>Rafael Nadal!</i>

44:58.840 --> 45:03.360
Rafa! Rafa! Rafa!

45:09.640 --> 45:11.280
<i>There's this aura about it.</i>

45:12.520 --> 45:14.320
<i>Everything is so perfect.</i>

45:15.560 --> 45:17.600
<i>Proper and royal.</i>

45:19.120 --> 45:22.360
<i>Violation, ball abuse.</i>
<i>Warning, Mr Kyrgios.</i>

45:24.240 --> 45:25.960
<i>I know what I bring to the table.</i>

45:26.040 --> 45:28.840
If I win Wimbledon, it's like
a middle finger to everyone.

45:28.920 --> 45:30.440
Are you kidding me?

45:30.520 --> 45:32.120
It's bullying. That's what he does.

45:34.280 --> 45:37.280
<i>The first African woman in the Open era</i>

45:37.360 --> 45:39.760
<i>to reach the Wimbledon final.</i>

45:40.800 --> 45:42.360
Life is good, you know.

45:44.240 --> 45:47.200
<i>The US Open is</i>
<i>the biggest tournament of the year.</i>

45:47.280 --> 45:50.320
<i>You get goosebumps.</i>
<i>You're fucking ready to go.</i>

45:52.080 --> 45:55.440
For someone to give a shit,
you have to win your home slam.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.800
<i>Nightmares can become reality.</i>

45:58.760 --> 46:00.560
<i>Dreams come true.</i>

46:01.080 --> 46:03.800
<i>This tournament can change</i>
<i>your whole life.</i>

46:08.080 --> 46:09.200
It was fucking insane.

46:11.720 --> 46:13.520
<i>I'm playing</i>
<i>the greatest of all time.</i>

46:13.600 --> 46:15.600
<i>Serena Williams.</i>

46:15.680 --> 46:17.120
<i>Nobody wants me to win.</i>

46:17.200 --> 46:19.600
Hey, guys, we are fucked.

46:22.680 --> 46:25.120
<i>You're going to be</i>
<i>part of history no matter what.</i>

46:25.920 --> 46:28.480
Alcaraz feels like Rafa and Roger did.

46:28.560 --> 46:30.600
<i>This kid is something else, something new.</i>

46:30.680 --> 46:32.800
I don't feel any pressure.

46:33.480 --> 46:35.000
I'm so excited.
