00:02.435 --> 00:05.604
<i>[James] Something in my head
is telling me I have to eat the food.</i>

00:05.606 --> 00:09.475
<i>I just cannot stop. I just, I
try everything in my power.</i>

00:16.182 --> 00:19.918
<i>[woman 1] Somewhere in
me is this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.920 --> 00:22.287
<i>I just want to be
a normal person.</i>

00:24.924 --> 00:26.959
[pants]

00:32.766 --> 00:36.101
You can't do it and then
I just get mad.

00:36.103 --> 00:40.105
<i>[woman 2] If I don't make a change
now, I'm scared it's going to be too late.</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:46.678
[grunts] No! It hurts!

00:46.680 --> 00:49.148
<i>[woman 3] I refuse
to stop fighting.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:51.316
<i>I have to do this
for my children.</i>

00:56.990 --> 00:58.624
Gotta sit down.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.960
<i>Just doing that was
a big struggle for me.</i>

01:01.962 --> 01:04.997
<i>But, it's only the beginning
of this journey.</i>

01:23.016 --> 01:24.583
[cell phone ringing]

01:24.585 --> 01:26.518
<i>I wake up in the morning time.</i>

01:26.520 --> 01:29.955
<i>The first thing I do before
I even brush my teeth.</i>

01:29.957 --> 01:31.924
Good morning. How you doing?
I'm calling to put in an order

01:31.926 --> 01:33.992
for breakfast this
morning, please.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.565
<i>That's the first thing I do.</i>

01:39.632 --> 01:42.868
All right, can I get the two slices
of Steak House premium pancake?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.970
Can I get two orders
of that, please?

01:47.006 --> 01:49.441
Can I get the Game Day
family feast?

01:49.443 --> 01:52.978
Can I get the original
French toasts?

01:52.980 --> 01:55.047
The amount of stuff that
you can get is just crazy.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.748
So, I just...

01:56.750 --> 01:59.585
I get excited.
It's like the Super Bowl.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.787
You can get whatever you want
now, you understand?

02:01.789 --> 02:05.124
And a slice of, let me get
a slice of ham.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.959
- Two of 'em.
<i>- [woman] Okay, is that all?</i>

02:06.961 --> 02:08.727
Yes.

02:11.064 --> 02:15.367
<i>But, once I place the order, I get anxious
even though the food don't take long.</i>

02:26.446 --> 02:28.747
- Hi. You're welcome. You too.
- Thank you so much. Have a wonderful day.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.949
- All right, thank you.
- Bye.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.820
<i>And once it get here,
it's the best part of my day</i>

02:34.822 --> 02:36.889
<i>because I love to eat.</i>

02:36.891 --> 02:39.124
<i>And I'm ready to go, you know?</i>

02:39.126 --> 02:40.959
<i>I'm always ready to eat.</i>

02:40.961 --> 02:43.462
<i>I just feel like the food
has to be eaten.</i>

02:43.464 --> 02:45.497
Food could be here
and I tell myself stop,

02:45.499 --> 02:46.632
just put it down.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.701
10 minutes later for some
reason, I'm back at it again.

02:49.703 --> 02:54.006
Something in my head is
telling me I have to eat the full.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.743
<i>Food just takes away the pain.
It takes away all the guilt.</i>

02:57.745 --> 03:00.212
<i>It takes away all the issues.</i>

03:00.214 --> 03:02.848
Everything just goes away,
whenever I have that first bite.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.951
<i>It just takes me
to another place.</i>

03:10.123 --> 03:14.660
<i>You know, the food, it just
blocks the world around you</i>

03:14.662 --> 03:16.295
<i>and then you feel comfortable.</i>

03:16.297 --> 03:18.530
You feel like nobody
could see you.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.732
<i>It gives me everything I want.</i>

03:20.734 --> 03:23.735
<i>But there's nothing worse than
coming to the end of a meal.</i>

03:23.737 --> 03:26.371
So, my breakfast is over.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.975
Then I'm already thinking
about lunch.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.843
<i>I do get full.</i>

03:31.845 --> 03:34.646
<i>But it's temporary.</i>

03:34.648 --> 03:37.082
- [grunts] <i>- Then I'm
already back on the phone.</i>

03:37.084 --> 03:39.418
Look on what I'm gonna get
for lunch.

03:43.723 --> 03:47.826
<i>Bathing myself is
the worst struggle of my day.</i>

03:47.828 --> 03:50.796
<i>Because moving around
when you're my size,</i>

03:50.798 --> 03:53.298
<i>it's very difficult
and it can be very painful.</i>

04:00.006 --> 04:02.074
<i>Being obese...</i>

04:02.642 --> 04:05.844
is one of the worse conditions

04:05.846 --> 04:08.714
that you could be in
in your life.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.717
<i>I don't recommend this
for nobody, like, I wouldn't.</i>

04:11.719 --> 04:14.453
<i>This is not no way for anybody
to be.</i>

04:14.455 --> 04:15.921
<i>Right now because of my weight,</i>

04:15.923 --> 04:17.089
<i>I'm having a lot
of back problems</i>

04:17.091 --> 04:18.557
<i>like my lower back.</i>

04:18.559 --> 04:22.127
It feels like I got hit
by a truck,

04:22.129 --> 04:24.696
like, my whole back
is in the worst pain ever.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.432
<i>So that only makes me move
slowly like a snail</i>

04:27.434 --> 04:29.968
<i>because any big movement
is painful.</i>

04:29.970 --> 04:31.503
<i>And the pain is all over
my body.</i>

04:31.505 --> 04:34.306
<i>My knees, my joints, my ankle.</i>

04:34.308 --> 04:36.541
You know because once I get
up, all this weight is just basically

04:36.543 --> 04:38.944
putting pressure on my legs.

04:38.946 --> 04:44.483
And, you know, my knees and
walking is extremely unbearable

04:44.485 --> 04:46.285
<i>like, the pain is so much.</i>

04:48.755 --> 04:52.791
<i>And showering is worse
because of all I have to do.</i>

04:52.793 --> 04:55.727
<i>Just to be able to bear it,
I have to have a chair.</i>

04:55.729 --> 04:57.829
<i>When I'm standing, I'm taking
a shower regularly,</i>

04:57.831 --> 05:00.899
<i>I get out of breath,
so I sit on the chair.</i>

05:00.901 --> 05:03.769
<i>I wash my backside first,
make sure that's good.</i>

05:03.771 --> 05:07.172
<i>Then I lather up
my shower glove.</i>

05:07.174 --> 05:09.741
<i>It's just like a wash cloth,
but it's gloves</i>

05:09.743 --> 05:12.344
<i>and I just rub down everything.</i>

05:13.780 --> 05:17.316
<i>I have a shower stick to reach
the parts that I can't reach</i>

05:17.318 --> 05:20.519
<i>because you have a lot
of cracks and crevices</i>

05:20.521 --> 05:25.957
that you have to dig in and make
sure everything is properly cleaned.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.759
So, I'm making my business
regardless of what I'm going through,

05:27.761 --> 05:29.661
<i>how I'm feeling.</i>

05:29.663 --> 05:33.432
<i>To make sure I hit that tub
and dig in whatever I got to dig in</i>

05:33.434 --> 05:35.867
<i>to take out what I forgot
to take out.</i>

05:35.869 --> 05:39.938
So, I wash my [bleep]
every day, faithfully.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.873
That's my workout.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.010
<i>After that's done,
then I'm ready for lunch.</i>

05:52.819 --> 05:54.753
<i>I grew up around food.</i>

05:54.755 --> 05:56.855
<i>It's always been a center
point of my life.</i>

05:56.857 --> 05:58.724
<i>Coming up
in the Caribbean culture,</i>

05:58.726 --> 06:01.960
the foods that we used
to eat is...

06:04.831 --> 06:06.898
These are the names
that we call them in Creole.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.401
You had your, like,
it's collard greens...

06:10.436 --> 06:12.704
<i>You have fried goat,
you got sausage.</i>

06:12.706 --> 06:15.640
<i>These are the things we ate
on a daily basis.</i>

06:15.642 --> 06:18.944
There was so much and <i>these
things, like, that's what plump you up.</i>

06:18.946 --> 06:20.479
I was cleaning up my plates.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.981
And all... my plate
was always clean.

06:23.950 --> 06:27.552
<i>It was just me and my brother,
and my mother most of the time,</i>

06:27.554 --> 06:29.087
<i>because my father wasn't around.</i>

06:29.089 --> 06:31.523
<i>He would stop by at times
to see us,</i>

06:31.525 --> 06:35.060
<i>but I didn't have a father
figure in the house growing up.</i>

06:35.062 --> 06:38.630
My mom used to always
just give me a lot of food.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.966
So, I ate very good growing up.

06:40.968 --> 06:44.469
<i>I was over 100 pounds when
I was six years old,</i>

06:44.471 --> 06:47.038
<i>and when I started going
to school, I had to find ways</i>

06:47.040 --> 06:49.141
<i>to feed my appetite
during the day</i>

06:49.143 --> 06:50.542
<i>because I was always hungry.</i>

06:50.544 --> 06:53.678
<i>So, I got cool with the
lunch ladies in the cafeteria.</i>

06:53.680 --> 06:57.916
<i>I would sweet talk them, so they'll
sneak me some food in the morning.</i>

06:57.918 --> 07:00.952
I would lie to the teacher and told
the teacher I'm going to the bathroom

07:00.954 --> 07:02.788
and I'll be ending up
in the lunch room.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.689
<i>Multiple times a day</i>

07:04.691 --> 07:06.558
<i>and then I have
a heavy meal at night,</i>

07:06.560 --> 07:09.995
<i>so it's just basically eating
all day.</i>

07:09.997 --> 07:12.564
<i>So with all that constant
eating, my weight got higher</i>

07:12.566 --> 07:14.466
<i>at a very quick pace.</i>

07:14.468 --> 07:17.202
<i>When I was eight,
I was 300 pounds already.</i>

07:18.538 --> 07:19.838
<i>I didn't care about
no academics.</i>

07:19.840 --> 07:22.841
<i>I didn't care about sports
or anything else.</i>

07:22.843 --> 07:25.744
People wanted me to play
football because I was a little bigger.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.612
I wanted to go to lunch.

07:27.614 --> 07:32.050
<i>So, I just continued to eat
like I was just greedy little kid.</i>

07:32.052 --> 07:35.287
<i>And so, no one could stop me.
I hit 450 by the time I hit 14</i>

07:35.289 --> 07:37.823
<i>and 15 years old.</i>

07:37.825 --> 07:41.927
<i>The weight didn't bother me, it bothered
everybody else, but it didn't bother me.</i>

07:41.929 --> 07:45.096
<i>I still gained through
the rest of high school.</i>

07:45.098 --> 07:46.932
<i>And when I finished
and I graduated,</i>

07:46.934 --> 07:49.234
<i>I was at the 500 mark.</i>

07:49.869 --> 07:52.904
<i>I finished high school,
but I didn't go to college.</i>

07:52.906 --> 07:55.807
<i>I wanted to work, now I wanted
to make some money now.</i>

07:55.809 --> 07:59.211
<i>So, I went and got
my security license.</i>

07:59.213 --> 08:00.579
<i>I was into
the whole security thing.</i>

08:00.581 --> 08:03.315
<i>And I just went into that field.</i>

08:03.317 --> 08:06.084
<i>And let my weight get worse
because now I was making money.</i>

08:06.086 --> 08:08.620
<i>So, now, I could get
whatever I want.</i>

08:08.622 --> 08:11.089
<i>I was dining out everywhere.</i>

08:11.091 --> 08:12.824
<i>So, that led me
to more weight gain.</i>

08:12.826 --> 08:14.459
<i>And that started to
make it difficult</i>

08:14.461 --> 08:16.495
<i>to even do the security job
I had.</i>

08:16.497 --> 08:19.831
<i>When I was 23, I realized
that I was limited in my career.</i>

08:19.833 --> 08:23.134
<i>So, I decided I want to make
a change to my life.</i>

08:24.504 --> 08:29.007
<i>So, around 24 years old,
I decided to change my scenery</i>

08:29.009 --> 08:31.977
<i>a little bit, I was getting
tired of New York.</i>

08:31.979 --> 08:33.612
<i>I moved to Fort Lauderdale,
Florida,</i>

08:33.614 --> 08:36.515
<i>and I kind of fell in love
with Florida lifestyle.</i>

08:36.517 --> 08:40.919
The people, the atmosphere, everything
was just a beautiful place to live.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.256
<i>You know and I got inspired
to start writing music.</i>

08:44.258 --> 08:46.725
<i>And I tried to pursue a career
in that industry.</i>

08:46.727 --> 08:49.394
<i>That's what I wanted
to be a part of.</i>

08:50.796 --> 08:52.731
<i>And pretty quickly, I got
to where I felt ready</i>

08:52.733 --> 08:55.767
<i>to start to show some
of my stuff off.</i>

08:55.769 --> 08:59.571
<i>So, I started to book some
studio time to record some demos.</i>

08:59.573 --> 09:01.339
<i>That's when I met Funkier.</i>

09:02.508 --> 09:05.911
<i>They had a studio session
that night.</i>

09:05.913 --> 09:09.781
<i>I see this pretty girl walk
past and I just approached her.</i>

09:09.783 --> 09:12.951
That's it. Oh, you know,
I lost my phone.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.654
Can you call me so I can find
where my phone is at?

09:15.656 --> 09:17.689
And that's how I was able
to obtain her phone number.

09:17.691 --> 09:22.394
<i>But, for some odd reason,
we just felt each other.</i>

09:23.963 --> 09:27.766
<i>So, what I did was I went and
got two part time security jobs</i>

09:27.768 --> 09:30.902
<i>to make ends meet.
She got her own place.</i>

09:30.904 --> 09:33.838
<i>And as soon as we was
living together,</i>

09:33.840 --> 09:36.708
<i>my significant other decided
that it was time for us</i>

09:36.710 --> 09:38.443
<i>to go on a diet.</i>

09:38.445 --> 09:41.179
<i>So, for a while, my weight
stabilized,</i>

09:41.181 --> 09:44.716
<i>but that didn't last for me
because I couldn't stay away</i>

09:44.718 --> 09:46.685
<i>from food.</i>

09:46.687 --> 09:50.055
<i>And the weight gain started
to accelerate again.</i>

09:51.290 --> 09:53.892
But I don't know where
<i>my weight's at 38,</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:57.929
<i>I just know that it's gotten
higher over the last few years.</i>

09:57.931 --> 09:59.998
<i>Because of the strain
I could feel over my body</i>

10:00.000 --> 10:03.735
<i>and how difficult it is to do
much of anything right now.</i>

10:03.737 --> 10:06.871
Funk can help me do
everything. You know,

10:06.873 --> 10:10.075
and I was starting to feel like a
burden on her shoulders as well.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.811
<i>And I refuse to let
that stand like that.</i>

10:12.813 --> 10:14.646
<i>So, about a year ago,
I decided to come back here</i>

10:14.648 --> 10:15.914
<i>to New York.</i>

10:15.981 --> 10:18.416
<i>She was telling me that I
could stay there with her,</i>

10:18.418 --> 10:20.585
<i>but I didn't want
our relationship to become</i>

10:20.587 --> 10:22.153
<i>her being my caretaker.</i>

10:22.155 --> 10:23.955
<i>So, I'm back here with
my own place</i>

10:23.957 --> 10:26.725
<i>and my family comes
and help me when I need it.</i>

10:26.727 --> 10:28.627
<i>But, you know, she's in Florida,</i>

10:28.629 --> 10:30.762
<i>and she's taking care
of her mama, you know,</i>

10:30.764 --> 10:33.798
<i>and that's her focus
for the time while I'm here.</i>

10:33.800 --> 10:36.668
<i>We're still good even though
we communicate from far.</i>

10:36.670 --> 10:39.137
<i>So, that's where I'm at now,
you know.</i>

10:39.139 --> 10:42.007
<i>I can't wait to go back down to
Florida, but it's only going to happen</i>

10:42.009 --> 10:43.808
<i>when I lose weight.</i>

10:43.810 --> 10:45.810
I basically can't do
anything right now.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.046
I can't function at all.

10:49.949 --> 10:52.283
- I'm ready for cake now.
- Let's go.

10:53.452 --> 10:55.453
- Yummy, yummy.
- Let's do it.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.255
[Cheyenne] All right.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.261
<i>[James] My cousins, they
bring me something that I like</i>

11:03.263 --> 11:04.829
<i>and eat with me.</i>

11:04.831 --> 11:07.632
Wow. It's nice.
It smell good.

11:07.634 --> 11:08.833
Should I take it out the box?

11:08.835 --> 11:11.736
- Yeah, you can just set it in the middle.
- This look nice.

11:11.738 --> 11:16.908
I love red velvet cake.
That's something I adore.

11:16.910 --> 11:20.078
<i>I got introduced to red velvet
cake when I moved to Florida.</i>

11:20.080 --> 11:22.580
<i>I have to have it daily.</i>

11:22.582 --> 11:24.516
<i>It's a part of my meals...</i>

11:24.518 --> 11:28.119
it's such and such, such
and such, and red velvet cake.

11:28.121 --> 11:31.723
Yeah, I need a big piece.
I need a large one. Oh, yeah.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.158
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Another big one?

11:33.160 --> 11:34.859
- No, that's good.
- That's good.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.128
- Yeah.
- Taste good?

11:40.199 --> 11:41.299
Good, right?

11:41.901 --> 11:44.335
It's not good, it's the best.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.606
James has always been big,
even from when we was younger.

11:48.608 --> 11:51.776
<i>But, he just gradually
as he got older,</i>

11:51.778 --> 11:55.714
<i>he got bigger, weighed about
700 pounds or something.</i>

11:55.716 --> 11:58.917
He barely can work.
When is it enough?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.952
That's what I tell him,
when is it enough?

12:00.954 --> 12:02.420
<i>You can't stay like this.</i>

12:04.990 --> 12:08.193
This cake hits it
every time on the nail.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.730
I'm glad you enjoyed the cake.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.665
Yeah, I appreciate it.
Thank you.

12:13.667 --> 12:16.134
You made my day today
with this cake. It's good.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.369
All right, let's clean up.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.005
[sighs]

12:21.007 --> 12:23.608
- Thank you.
- No problem. No problem.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.076
I'll be right back.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.712
<i>So, I'm mostly just stay
at home now.</i>

12:27.714 --> 12:29.581
<i>I can order what I want now.</i>

12:29.583 --> 12:33.017
<i>And my brother and my cousin
help me get what I need,</i>

12:33.019 --> 12:36.121
<i>so I don't have to suffer
going in front of public.</i>

12:36.922 --> 12:38.923
Yo.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.125
<i>What's good? What's
going on, man? I'm here.</i>

12:40.127 --> 12:41.826
What's up, Brody.

12:41.828 --> 12:42.794
<i>Yeah, I need some snacks, bro.</i>

12:42.796 --> 12:45.930
<i>I need some to keep me,
keep me motivated.</i>

12:45.932 --> 12:48.700
<i>My brother will do
some grocery shopping for me.</i>

12:48.702 --> 12:51.770
<i>He use video call to show me
where he's at in the store.</i>

12:51.772 --> 12:54.506
<i>So, I could guide him
to get me what I need.</i>

12:54.508 --> 12:57.742
All right. Yo, that's the
ice cream aisle, right?

12:57.744 --> 13:00.011
<i>All right, let me get
two ice cream bars.</i>

13:00.980 --> 13:04.048
Facts, bro. I needs that.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.884
<i>That's how I gotta do shopping
right now,</i>

13:05.886 --> 13:06.918
<i>'cause of my size.</i>

13:06.920 --> 13:09.988
<i>I have to have assistance
like that.</i>

13:09.990 --> 13:12.724
<i>My brother does it for me
a few times a week</i>

13:12.726 --> 13:14.893
<i>to help me get what I need.</i>

13:14.895 --> 13:16.728
And let me see what aisle
you on and I'll tell you

13:16.730 --> 13:17.729
just what to grab.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.464
<i>Right there. Right there.</i>

13:19.466 --> 13:21.466
The sodas, the sodas.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.301
Can you get the fruit punch
joint?

13:24.003 --> 13:26.271
Let me get the Mandarin.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.674
<i>Let me get that cheese
right there.</i>

13:29.676 --> 13:32.210
- Yeah, right, right.
- Yeah, top that.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.946
<i>Let me get that right there.
The scoop.</i>

13:35.080 --> 13:36.247
Yeah, I got you.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.184
<i>I need to put that cheese
in there. Yeah, yeah.</i>

13:43.289 --> 13:44.556
That's it for snacks, bro?
That's it?

13:44.558 --> 13:47.158
<i>That's it. All right.</i>

13:50.596 --> 13:53.765
And also try to tell him what
not to eat, what he should do.

13:53.767 --> 13:57.268
You know, I try to just
give him advice to get better,

13:59.038 --> 14:01.072
<i>I miss just hanging out,
going out,</i>

14:01.074 --> 14:05.043
kind of have not been able
to go out past couple years.

14:05.811 --> 14:08.346
- [door bell ringing]
- Coming.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.218
- [bleep] crazy.
- Need some help?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.719
- Watch out, you gotta hold it from the bottom.
- Busted?

14:14.753 --> 14:16.821
Yeah.

14:16.823 --> 14:20.925
It it is what it is. Let's
go eat. Food, food, food.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.460
What do we got today?

14:22.462 --> 14:24.996
We got some chicken.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.598
Yeah, I appreciate you guys,
for real.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.766
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.802
<i>The worst part about
my situation now</i>

14:30.804 --> 14:32.937
<i>is that it's financially
making me struggle.</i>

14:32.939 --> 14:36.107
<i>Because, you know,
I got bills too.</i>

14:36.109 --> 14:39.410
I can't afford to buy food
and take care of my bills.

14:39.979 --> 14:41.379
I can't do that.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.481
You know, but...

14:43.483 --> 14:46.451
<i>with this addiction I have,
it's actually...</i>

14:46.453 --> 14:49.320
<i>one's becoming more important
than the other.</i>

14:50.956 --> 14:54.392
Is it good? Let me take
a little look see, look see.

14:55.995 --> 14:58.897
And what we got over here.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.932
Help me open them up, please?

15:00.934 --> 15:02.000
It's also, like...

15:02.002 --> 15:05.203
The world has just
pushed me away

15:05.205 --> 15:08.273
<i>because of that,
I resort to food.</i>

15:10.009 --> 15:13.244
I'm loving the food,
these ribs... Oh, my God.

15:13.946 --> 15:17.415
- Are they the best thing for you?
- Yeah.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.151
<i>But, I know at the end
of the day, I'm a food addict.</i>

15:20.153 --> 15:22.553
And I'm depressed because
I don't have

15:22.555 --> 15:24.522
normal conversations no more.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.724
<i>Everything is pertaining
to my weight.</i>

15:26.726 --> 15:30.728
Regardless if it's mother,
my brother, my friends

15:30.730 --> 15:33.031
and regardless of who it is.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.999
<i>It's always pertaining
to my weight.</i>

15:35.001 --> 15:36.267
<i>Everything.</i>

15:36.402 --> 15:37.769
<i>Everything.</i>

15:38.003 --> 15:41.906
The condition I'm in, they just
gonna just be either scared for me.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.641
<i>They're praying for me.</i>

15:43.643 --> 15:46.144
<i>And why I let myself
get this way.</i>

15:46.146 --> 15:48.112
<i>And what I should do
to get rid of it.</i>

15:48.114 --> 15:50.448
But I know they are right
because I believe that

15:50.450 --> 15:52.183
I'm killing myself.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.954
<i>Because every time
I take a bite,</i>

15:56.388 --> 15:59.624
<i>I've taken away more
from my life.</i>

15:59.626 --> 16:02.627
<i>Knowing that I'm doing that,
I continue to do so.</i>

16:02.629 --> 16:06.631
But I just can't stop.
I really can't.

16:06.633 --> 16:10.768
I just cannot stop.
I try everything in my power.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.271
<i>I'm at a point where soon
I'm going to take</i>

16:13.273 --> 16:15.907
<i>that fatal bite and that's
going to be my last.</i>

16:15.909 --> 16:16.908
Oh, boy.

16:16.910 --> 16:18.977
[grunts]

16:20.646 --> 16:23.014
<i>I have to do something
before it happens.</i>

16:23.016 --> 16:25.950
<i>Or soon, food is gonna kill me.</i>

16:39.765 --> 16:42.533
- Are you guys ready?
- [Cheyenne] Yes, sir.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.634
Your water bottle.

16:43.636 --> 16:46.604
Can you put that down for me?
And I get it downstairs?

16:46.606 --> 16:48.806
I got a hold the rails
when I come downstairs.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.009
- So, I'm ready, you ready?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.777
- Let's make those moves.
- Let's go make these moves.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.879
Let's make these money moves.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.815
- Let's go, let's go.
- No, I got it. I'mma get up.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.851
I got to do certain things
some time now.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.487
And sometimes I need to, you
know, I'm in my weight loss journey.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.122
So, I got to do things.

17:04.124 --> 17:07.458
- You're afraid you're gonna make me fall?
- No, just, I got it.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.161
Are you sure?
Come on, let's go.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.797
<i>My friends Mike and Marcus,
and my cousin Cheyenne</i>

17:12.799 --> 17:16.000
<i>is taking me to Houston
to see Dr. Now.</i>

17:17.536 --> 17:20.004
<i>We're going down there
as a last ditch effort for me</i>

17:20.006 --> 17:22.774
<i>to lose weight,
but I'm not looking forward</i>

17:22.776 --> 17:24.409
<i>to any of this right now.</i>

17:24.411 --> 17:26.077
[Cheyenne] Be careful.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.616
<i>I know this is a now or
never situation for me.</i>

17:31.618 --> 17:33.951
<i>So, I just got to do this.</i>

17:33.953 --> 17:37.088
<i>And I mentally prepared myself
for this.</i>

17:37.090 --> 17:39.390
<i>Okay, it's gonna be
a hard experience for me.</i>

17:41.593 --> 17:43.961
[pants] Oh, God.

17:47.699 --> 17:50.001
When we finally see him after
the COVID and stuff like that,

17:50.003 --> 17:51.969
we seen that he got bigger.

17:52.738 --> 17:56.674
<i>Five flights of stairs,
no elevator</i>

17:56.676 --> 17:59.343
and he was always saying,
you know, I need to lose weight.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.345
I don't know how to lose weight.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.383
[pants]

18:16.728 --> 18:18.296
[pants]

18:21.467 --> 18:22.767
<i>Stress is not going
to do anything for me,</i>

18:22.769 --> 18:25.169
<i>it might make it worse.</i>

18:25.171 --> 18:28.206
So, you have to do something,
you need help. It's okay.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.273
Everybody needs help.

18:36.415 --> 18:39.150
[grunts]

18:39.152 --> 18:41.686
<i>Just coming down here
was a lot for me.</i>

18:41.688 --> 18:43.488
[pants]

18:47.459 --> 18:50.261
<i>But, it's only the beginning
of this journey.</i>

18:54.733 --> 18:58.236
- [man] What's up, buddy? You good?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

19:01.173 --> 19:02.940
[Cheyenne] Come on, James.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.345
[pants]

19:09.481 --> 19:11.149
You ready, James?

19:11.151 --> 19:14.252
Road trip, road trip.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.261
[engine starts]

19:27.866 --> 19:32.970
<i>So, I have a lot of worries about
how I'm gonna take on the road.</i>

19:32.972 --> 19:37.975
<i>I'm not gonna let that stop me
from trying to do this.</i>

19:40.879 --> 19:43.080
I just hope that I could
<i>do this.</i>

19:43.082 --> 19:46.017
<i>But I know I have
a long trip ahead of me.</i>

19:46.084 --> 19:49.053
<i>I just hope that I can make it</i>

19:49.055 --> 19:51.422
<i>because I don't have
any help here.</i>

19:56.762 --> 19:58.329
This cake is so good.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.331
I'mma bring Mr. Now
a piece of cake.

20:10.275 --> 20:14.345
<i>This has been one of the
longest days I had in a long time.</i>

20:20.686 --> 20:24.488
<i>We made it down the road
about five hours.</i>

20:24.490 --> 20:28.326
<i>But I will say I'm ready
to get out and stretch myself.</i>

20:29.928 --> 20:35.066
<i>To handle all the movement
and strain of sitting that time.</i>

20:39.271 --> 20:42.039
<i>Because I feel like
I'm at my limit for the day.</i>

20:42.041 --> 20:45.076
<i>I'm not used to being
this cramped.</i>

20:46.011 --> 20:47.878
<i>So, getting in a bed
will feel nice.</i>

20:47.880 --> 20:50.214
[pants]

20:52.818 --> 20:55.152
Hey, you're supposed
to pick that up, man.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.188
It's not about this.

20:57.190 --> 20:58.756
How are you feeling, James?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.725
- I'm all right.
- Hmm?

21:00.727 --> 21:03.060
- I'm all right.
- Are you sure?

21:05.063 --> 21:07.231
Just take your time, okay?

21:07.233 --> 21:10.101
- I'm cool.
- You're breathing okay?

21:14.439 --> 21:16.140
Your legs hurt?

21:17.142 --> 21:19.110
Come on, let's go.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.288
<i>That was a lot.</i>

21:32.557 --> 21:35.526
<i>But I'm gonna keep
pushing forward.</i>

21:35.528 --> 21:38.396
My plan is to just do <i>the
same as I did this day.</i>

21:38.398 --> 21:41.899
<i>Over the next few days
until we get there.</i>

21:41.901 --> 21:43.668
<i>And then I think it's three
days to my appointment</i>

21:43.670 --> 21:45.436
<i>with Dr. Now.</i>

21:48.907 --> 21:51.876
<i>I'm just gonna stay steady
with my pain</i>

21:51.878 --> 21:54.011
<i>and hopefully
I'll make it by then.</i>

22:02.788 --> 22:05.489
[snoring]

22:10.762 --> 22:13.731
<i>We've just been able
to roll into Dr. Now's place.</i>

22:13.733 --> 22:15.733
<i>It's taken a total
of three days,</i>

22:15.735 --> 22:18.669
<i>but I pretty much was able
to do with that plan</i>

22:18.671 --> 22:21.005
<i>and stay steady with my pain.</i>

22:26.011 --> 22:28.012
[Cheyenne] You ready, James?

22:28.513 --> 22:30.214
Let's go get 'em.

22:30.216 --> 22:34.218
Let's go see what Dr. Now
is talking about it.

22:34.220 --> 22:37.054
Whoo, it is hot.

22:39.891 --> 22:40.591
You need help, James?

22:40.593 --> 22:43.027
I'm getting my legs together.

22:43.029 --> 22:47.531
- Give me, give me a moment.
- Yeah, I see your feet little ashy there.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.835
<i>My nervousness about
seeing him today,</i>

22:50.837 --> 22:53.137
<i>it's mostly for what it's
gonna take to get his help.</i>

22:53.139 --> 22:54.205
Oh, my leg.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.439
You wobbling?

22:56.508 --> 22:57.475
Come on.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.976
<i>But I wouldn't have come
all this way</i>

22:58.978 --> 23:02.246
<i>if I hadn't prepared myself
to do that.</i>

23:02.248 --> 23:04.348
<i>So, I'm ready to hear that
as long as it means</i>

23:04.350 --> 23:07.385
<i>I'm gonna get the help I need
to get a better life.</i>

23:12.023 --> 23:15.326
It's hot as hell, boy. I didn't
know it's this hot out here.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.363
James.

23:21.767 --> 23:24.168
Let's go, James.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.707
<i>It's been a little while since
I've got my weight.</i>

23:29.709 --> 23:32.410
<i>But, the last time
I was about 600 pounds.</i>

23:33.979 --> 23:37.081
<i>And that's where I'm expected
to be at.</i>

23:37.783 --> 23:40.351
Okay, you want to step up
on the scale?

23:42.421 --> 23:45.189
<i>But I'm really hoping
finding out my weight today</i>

23:46.458 --> 23:49.260
<i>doesn't show me that
it's a lot higher than that.</i>

23:56.368 --> 24:00.037
Oh, my gosh.
This will be announced.

24:09.915 --> 24:13.751
<i>I'm down at Dr. Now's to see
him for help with my weight.</i>

24:13.753 --> 24:17.154
<i>And I'm about to find out
what my weight is up to</i>

24:17.156 --> 24:20.291
<i>and I'm hoping it's around
600 like I think.</i>

24:23.929 --> 24:26.030
Your weight is 625.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.469
<i>That's the range
I was expecting.</i>

24:31.471 --> 24:32.870
<i>So, I'm happy about that.</i>

24:32.872 --> 24:35.806
<i>But, all this walking
and moving around</i>

24:35.808 --> 24:37.908
<i>is taking too much of a toll
on me.</i>

24:37.910 --> 24:40.444
I'm gonna stay on my knees.

24:40.446 --> 24:43.013
I been cramped up
in a car for days.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.182
My legs just get me now.

24:49.888 --> 24:52.456
- You think you ready, you need me to help you?
- I'm good.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.458
We're gonna go to room five.

24:54.460 --> 24:58.229
<i>I'm exhausted from traveling
to here.</i>

25:03.134 --> 25:05.069
<i>With my weight where it is.</i>

25:06.638 --> 25:08.372
<i>It's a lot on me.</i>

25:11.710 --> 25:14.044
<i>But, I'm here to get help
with that.</i>

25:14.946 --> 25:17.214
<i>Because I need to change that.</i>

25:19.451 --> 25:21.018
- You okay?
- Yeah.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.487
That's took a lot out of you?

25:26.725 --> 25:28.359
[knocking at door]

25:30.061 --> 25:32.062
- Hello.
- Hey, Dr. Now, how are you doing?

25:32.064 --> 25:33.831
- Hi, Dr. Now.
- Y'all doing okay?

25:33.833 --> 25:36.433
- Yeah, how you doing?
- Yes, we are.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.702
- What about you?
- Good. I'm doing well.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.105
- You must be James.
- Yes, I am.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.440
- And who's this young lady?
- That's my cousin Cheyenne.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.909
Cheyenne, I'm his cousin
Cheyenne.

25:44.911 --> 25:48.412
All right. So, you all came all
the way from New York, huh?

25:48.414 --> 25:50.881
- Yes, sir.
- What brought you from New York?

25:50.883 --> 25:53.851
Weight loss surgery, Dr. Now. I
need to get this weight off for me.

25:53.853 --> 25:57.454
Okay, so you're 625 pounds

25:57.456 --> 26:02.526
and you have a BMI
of almost 104.

26:02.528 --> 26:04.862
Is this the highest weight
you have been?

26:04.864 --> 26:08.699
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, so how do you think you got to this point?

26:08.733 --> 26:10.133
Eating.

26:10.669 --> 26:14.772
Well, I can't argue with that. So,
tell me about your eating habit.

26:14.774 --> 26:17.741
Oh, it's not good.
Um, I'm eating outside foods.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.944
I'm not able to cook for
myself because I'm not...

26:19.946 --> 26:22.012
my cooking is not that good.

26:22.014 --> 26:25.950
So, I'm constantly buying
food outside.

26:25.952 --> 26:28.519
You know, um, on a day
to day basis.

26:28.521 --> 26:31.155
Lunch, breakfast, dinner.

26:31.157 --> 26:34.024
It's being getting unhealthy meals
from outside delivered to my home

26:34.026 --> 26:35.259
every day.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.895
So, you eat mostly what
you order?

26:37.897 --> 26:39.763
Yeah, I order food,
yeah, delivery.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.799
Well, they can deliver salads.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.934
So, the issue is
the food you're choosing

26:43.936 --> 26:45.836
and the amount you're eating.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.572
So, what is driving you
to eat like that?

26:48.574 --> 26:52.876
Ah, lately,
it's been depression lately.

26:52.878 --> 26:55.846
- So, you eating because of depression?
- Yes.

26:55.848 --> 26:56.947
I believe so.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.449
Because of my weight.

26:58.451 --> 27:00.117
So, you're depressed
because of your weight

27:00.119 --> 27:01.652
and your weight
is the depression,

27:01.654 --> 27:02.820
then you eat?

27:02.822 --> 27:04.955
Yes, so it's leading me
to depression.

27:04.957 --> 27:08.025
That's what you call
a vicious circle?

27:08.027 --> 27:08.925
- I guess so.
- All right,

27:08.927 --> 27:12.096
and so what have you done
to change that?

27:12.098 --> 27:14.732
I mean, you know, I just,
I haven't done anything

27:14.734 --> 27:17.034
to be honest with you. I just,
I just blocked myself off

27:17.036 --> 27:18.802
from the world. Um...

27:18.870 --> 27:20.137
You know...

27:20.505 --> 27:23.941
depression is because I wanna
go out, how people look at me,

27:23.943 --> 27:26.010
how I'm treated out in the
real world and stuff like that.

27:26.012 --> 27:29.647
So, I just block out the world
and I just stay home and just eat.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.750
So, what is your expectation
coming here

27:32.752 --> 27:36.954
if you haven't been willing to
change your situation on your own?

27:36.956 --> 27:38.789
Dr. Now, I'm here to see you
because I want to do

27:38.791 --> 27:41.091
whatever it takes, like...

27:41.760 --> 27:44.028
You just lead me the right way
and I'll follow.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.730
I just want to get it done.
I just...

27:46.732 --> 27:49.566
Well, James, I can give you
direction,

27:49.568 --> 27:51.802
but there's gonna be
no magic about it.

27:51.804 --> 27:55.773
And so, you expect that
you continue doing

27:55.775 --> 27:58.509
what you're doing,
and I make you lose weight,

27:58.511 --> 28:00.310
- that's not going to happen.
- Right.

28:09.454 --> 28:12.856
And up to you to have
the motivation to do that.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.892
- You think can do that.
- Yes, sir.

28:14.894 --> 28:18.629
All right. So, currently,
how's your activity?

28:18.631 --> 28:22.966
Uh, walking is tough.
Walking is tough, like...

28:22.968 --> 28:25.936
taking a couple of steps
and I'm just wondering,

28:25.938 --> 28:28.505
um, well guess what
with my lower back.

28:28.507 --> 28:32.042
That's... my lower back,
my knees and now my ankle.

28:42.954 --> 28:46.023
And the more inactive we get,
the higher the chances

28:46.025 --> 28:47.691
of that happening are.

28:47.693 --> 28:51.562
The way you're right now,
you can only walk ten step.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.030
This very dangerous situation.

28:53.032 --> 28:55.933
So, you need to change
your eating habit right away.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.268
Because ultimately,
weight loss surgery

28:58.270 --> 29:00.671
is going to be the only
solution for your problem.

29:00.673 --> 29:03.073
Because this is
a disease, metabolic disease

29:03.075 --> 29:05.075
that you inherit from
your parents.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.778
And the only way we can change
that

29:07.780 --> 29:09.580
and do weight loss surgery.

29:09.582 --> 29:14.151
But, the obstacle course
that you have is to get yourself

29:14.153 --> 29:16.754
to the point that surgery's
going to be safe for you.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.255
- Okay?
- I got it.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.825
- So, do you think you can do all that?
- Yes, sir.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.193
- Yes.
- Okay.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.329
So, eating three times a day
is fine.

29:25.331 --> 29:28.866
No snack in between the meal,
alcohol is completely off

29:28.868 --> 29:32.603
and you need to watch the
calorie content of what you eating.

29:32.605 --> 29:35.906
Make sure it's around
400 calories per meal

29:35.908 --> 29:41.779
and make sure that is a high
protein and no carb in it, okay?

29:41.781 --> 29:44.615
- Okay.
- So, I'm gonna give you some stuff I want you

29:44.617 --> 29:45.849
to read every night.

29:45.851 --> 29:49.419
Go over it every now,
make sure you understand it

29:49.421 --> 29:52.156
and see what you have done
wrong with your eating habit.

29:52.158 --> 29:55.959
- Okay.
- And see if you can correct that for tomorrow.

29:55.961 --> 29:56.960
- Okay?
- Okay.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.029
But you're gonna have to start
doing your part

29:59.031 --> 30:01.598
in changing your eating
habit right away

30:01.600 --> 30:04.134
because we're running out
of time, you know,

30:04.136 --> 30:07.070
it's a very dangerous
situation that you're in.

30:07.072 --> 30:08.539
So, think you can do that?

30:08.541 --> 30:09.740
Yes, sir.

30:09.742 --> 30:12.709
- I know I can.
- The only way you can lose weight

30:12.711 --> 30:15.045
is to reduce
your calorie intake, okay?

30:15.047 --> 30:17.080
So, I'm going to give you
some instruction

30:17.082 --> 30:19.850
that has a 1200 calorie a day,

30:19.852 --> 30:21.485
high protein, low carb diet

30:21.487 --> 30:23.887
that I want you to start
following now.

30:23.889 --> 30:28.859
And it has a few exercises that I want
you to start doing twice a day, okay?

30:28.861 --> 30:30.861
- Okay.
- And if you follow that,

30:30.863 --> 30:35.199
you should very easily be able
to lose at least 80 pounds

30:35.201 --> 30:36.900
- over the next two months.
- In two months?

30:36.902 --> 30:38.735
Yeah, okay?

30:38.737 --> 30:41.004
That's gonna be easy goal
to do if you stick with

30:41.006 --> 30:42.039
the 1200 calorie diet.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.841
Okay?

30:43.843 --> 30:45.709
That's a goal I'm gonna give you

30:45.711 --> 30:47.978
and if you do that,
we're gonna go ahead

30:47.980 --> 30:51.682
and ask you to move down to
Houston to get you in our program.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.283
But, if you're not able
to do that,

30:53.285 --> 30:55.452
then there is not much
we can do.

30:55.454 --> 30:56.620
- Okay?
- Okay.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.056
Because there's no way
right now we can get you

30:59.058 --> 31:01.625
to lose weight unless
you change your eating habits.

31:01.627 --> 31:02.692
Okay?

31:09.968 --> 31:12.803
And help you work on what
you need to be successful

31:12.805 --> 31:14.671
for the long term.

31:14.673 --> 31:17.441
So, first thing is to change
your eating habit

31:17.443 --> 31:19.576
and try to lose some
weight, okay?

31:19.578 --> 31:22.112
- So I'm gonna bring some stuff for you.
- Okay, okay.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.314
- All right, I'll be back.
- All right.

31:30.154 --> 31:31.321
Well...

31:32.557 --> 31:35.025
No more cheeseburgers.

31:35.027 --> 31:39.830
My big concern with James is that
he's not as motivated as he says,

31:39.832 --> 31:42.432
<i>I have no doubt he wants
to change</i>

31:42.434 --> 31:44.735
<i>and he sees how important it is.</i>

31:44.737 --> 31:46.637
<i>He does that right now.</i>

31:46.639 --> 31:49.640
But I think he believes
there's gonna be some level

31:49.642 --> 31:51.975
of magic solution with
what we give him

31:51.977 --> 31:55.545
<i>and that he doesn't fully
realize how hard</i>

31:55.547 --> 31:58.448
<i>this process is going to be
for him because</i>

31:58.450 --> 32:01.518
<i>it's going to all depend on
his willingness</i>

32:01.520 --> 32:04.788
and drive to turn
his own life around.

32:04.790 --> 32:09.493
The travel... The whole moving
down here is gonna... that's, that's...

32:09.495 --> 32:12.262
I mean, I'm not gonna say
it's a problem, it's just...

32:12.997 --> 32:15.565
And I'm already, I don't
know, that's, that's something

32:15.567 --> 32:19.102
I have to really focus on
how I'm a do that.

32:19.104 --> 32:21.271
The moving down here
is going to be really tough.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.611
- All right, James.
- Okay.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.780
Here's what I got for you,

32:29.782 --> 32:33.250
that I want you to read
every night

32:33.252 --> 32:35.886
and this the food
that you need to avoid.

32:35.888 --> 32:37.187
Okay?

32:37.189 --> 32:39.957
So, you go over this
and motivate yourself

32:39.959 --> 32:42.159
and see what you can do.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.528
- Okay?
- All right, any questions?

32:44.530 --> 32:45.829
No, that's it.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.998
- So, you think you can do all this?
- Yes, sir.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.599
All right. That's good.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.069
So, we'll give you all
the opportunity to do that.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.937
- Okay.
- All right, James, from this point,

32:53.939 --> 32:56.106
- everything gonna be up to you.
- Okay.

32:56.108 --> 32:57.674
- Okay? All right.
- Okay.

32:57.676 --> 32:58.775
Let's do it.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.711
All right, if you need
anything, give me a call.

33:00.713 --> 33:02.679
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you, Dr. Now.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.815
You're welcome.
Have a safe trip back home.

33:04.817 --> 33:06.950
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.185
- All right, Doctor.
- Nice to meet you.

33:08.187 --> 33:09.453
Nice meeting you too.

33:14.892 --> 33:16.660
Damn. 80 pounds?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.028
You can do it, James.

33:18.030 --> 33:20.764
- It's easier said than done.
- In two months?

33:20.766 --> 33:24.334
- Two months.
- We're good, we're good.

33:26.004 --> 33:29.473
<i>I know Dr. Now will need
something from me, but that's a lot.</i>

33:30.308 --> 33:31.875
<i>And I wasn't expecting that.</i>

33:31.877 --> 33:35.245
<i>Basically, it means I got to cut
off all the food I'm eating now.</i>

33:35.247 --> 33:38.749
<i>All the high calorie fried
foods I like immediately.</i>

33:38.751 --> 33:39.950
<i>Like, yesterday.</i>

33:39.952 --> 33:42.052
Sugar stuff, all that stuff.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.955
Red velvet cake no more.
That's it.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.857
<i>It's over.</i>

33:46.859 --> 33:49.960
<i>You know, I have to go
and prepare myself</i>

33:49.962 --> 33:52.029
<i>for the next two months.</i>

33:52.031 --> 33:54.364
<i>Like, all those things
is out the window.</i>

33:57.235 --> 34:00.837
I gotta, I gotta find
healthy alternatives.

34:00.839 --> 34:04.207
So, I can, um, try
to lose weight.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.989
It's time for that, um,
a little workout, bro.

34:18.991 --> 34:21.792
- So, you ready?
- [sighs] You think I can do it, B?

34:21.794 --> 34:24.761
- Definitely.
- All right, let's do this, B.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.430
[grunts] Help me.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.800
[grunts] Good looking homie.

34:29.867 --> 34:33.136
Good looking.

34:36.908 --> 34:40.243
<i>After going to see Dr. Now,
I've started doing the changes</i>

34:40.245 --> 34:43.080
<i>I need according
to his instructions.</i>

34:47.919 --> 34:50.020
Here goes nothing.

34:50.388 --> 34:52.556
Dr. Now, it's me and you.

34:52.558 --> 34:55.859
<i>It's been like a life overhaul
for the past couple of weeks</i>

34:55.861 --> 34:57.761
<i>for me because I'm
doing everything different,</i>

34:57.763 --> 35:00.730
<i>you know, and I'm trying
my best.</i>

35:00.732 --> 35:02.966
<i>And, you know, it's been tough
because I had to give up</i>

35:02.968 --> 35:05.001
<i>a lot of what I like.</i>

35:05.003 --> 35:09.473
<i>For my exercises,
I've been doing them</i>

35:09.475 --> 35:11.441
<i>twice a day like
I'm supposed to.</i>

35:11.443 --> 35:13.009
<i>And I stuck to those even though</i>

35:13.011 --> 35:14.478
<i>they haven't been easy.</i>

35:14.480 --> 35:16.446
<i>My diet's is doing good too.</i>

35:16.448 --> 35:18.915
<i>Cheyenne has been helping me
by coming over and helping me</i>

35:18.917 --> 35:23.053
<i>make the healthier option
instead of my usual foods.</i>

35:23.055 --> 35:25.388
<i>Because if I'm alone,
I'm going to eat more</i>

35:25.390 --> 35:27.991
<i>because the temptation
is harder.</i>

35:27.993 --> 35:30.327
<i>And there's days where
there's more of a struggle,</i>

35:30.329 --> 35:33.930
<i>and I don't make it without
giving something I shouldn't.</i>

35:33.932 --> 35:37.200
<i>And I think that's just part
of the transition, you know.</i>

35:39.203 --> 35:41.438
You're ready to bust
down some food?

35:42.173 --> 35:44.474
Yeah. Inspector Gadget.

35:53.451 --> 35:54.784
Mmm.

35:54.786 --> 35:55.752
[Cheyenne] What's up
with the cheese?

35:55.754 --> 35:57.954
I need a little flavor.

35:57.956 --> 36:00.757
Just relax, I'm telling you it's
nothing to... I won't lie to you.

36:00.759 --> 36:03.460
I'm taking this serious,
I won't lie to you.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.962
This is nothing
but protein here.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.932
The doctor says high protein,
low carb diet.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.700
So, in my bowl.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.035
I have steak.

36:13.004 --> 36:18.475
-Chicken, beans, lettuce,
-Mm-hmm.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.677
- Some cheese.
- And cheese, that's it.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.846
Cheese is not on my list
of things that I can't have,

36:22.848 --> 36:24.447
so that's why cheese
is on there.

36:24.449 --> 36:26.316
If cheese wasn't on it,
I wouldn't have it.

36:28.052 --> 36:30.820
- Is that all you're gonna eat today?
- Yeah, it's all I need.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.889
A meal now and a meal later.

36:32.891 --> 36:36.159
I ate half on my plate and
you'll save the other for later.

36:36.161 --> 36:37.761
And I'm full.

36:37.763 --> 36:38.595
I'm full.

36:38.597 --> 36:41.031
This is my dinner for tonight.

36:41.033 --> 36:43.867
- You ready to go do some exercise?
- Yeah.

36:43.901 --> 36:46.236
Come on, let's go.

36:47.672 --> 36:51.274
- You think you can be able to exercise in that?
- Yeah.

36:52.443 --> 36:54.644
<i>The only issues I've been
having with the exercises</i>

36:54.646 --> 36:56.479
<i>is the walking.</i>

36:56.481 --> 37:00.650
<i>I haven't been able to work up to
walking up and down the stairs every day.</i>

37:00.652 --> 37:03.687
<i>But Cheyenne been telling me
that I need to start by doing</i>

37:03.689 --> 37:07.457
<i>one thing of stairs
a few times every day.</i>

37:07.459 --> 37:09.826
<i>I told her I'll try to do
that with her today</i>

37:09.828 --> 37:12.796
<i>because I'm ready to get
working everywhere I need,</i>

37:12.798 --> 37:15.065
<i>as long as my body
could handle it.</i>

37:15.067 --> 37:17.000
You can do it.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.002
[pants]

37:19.203 --> 37:21.905
Got one more round to go.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.441
- One more and you're done.
- One more after this.

37:24.443 --> 37:26.309
You're not saying anything.

37:30.848 --> 37:32.349
[pants]

37:36.887 --> 37:40.156
- One...
- [grunts]

37:42.860 --> 37:45.061
Get upstairs, but you got this.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.197
You almost finished.

37:49.667 --> 37:51.434
Might have to get you a trainer.

37:53.170 --> 37:57.540
Yay, you did it. Can I have a
hug or something? My God.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.843
You see? You did it.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.711
<i>This is the most
I've ever worked myself</i>

38:01.713 --> 38:04.180
<i>and it's hard,
but it feels good.</i>

38:04.182 --> 38:05.448
<i>And I'll keep doing it.</i>

38:05.450 --> 38:07.217
How'd you feel?

38:07.785 --> 38:09.052
What you thinking?

38:09.054 --> 38:11.154
Cheyenne, I can't talk.
I'm trying to catch my breath.

38:11.156 --> 38:13.423
- [laughs]
- Damn.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.992
These stairs is brutal.

38:30.841 --> 38:33.176
<i>The past month took
an unexpected turn,</i>

38:33.178 --> 38:35.578
<i>a couple of weeks ago
because my dad</i>

38:35.580 --> 38:37.047
<i>suddenly passed away.</i>

38:37.049 --> 38:39.716
<i>And, so that was a hard moment
for me and my family.</i>

38:39.718 --> 38:42.919
<i>Even though he wasn't around
as much growing up.</i>

38:42.921 --> 38:45.221
<i>He was still my dad
and to lose him suddenly</i>

38:45.223 --> 38:46.856
<i>was a shock.</i>

38:46.858 --> 38:49.959
<i>And it's been an unexpected
setback for me.</i>

38:49.961 --> 38:53.229
<i>But, the tragedy has not
pushed me off course.</i>

38:53.231 --> 38:55.065
<i>You know, it's made some
harder moments,</i>

38:55.067 --> 38:58.234
<i>but I'm still trying
to do everything that I need.</i>

38:59.804 --> 39:01.705
How you doing? What's new?

39:01.707 --> 39:02.639
You went to the laundry for me?

39:02.641 --> 39:04.808
Yeah, how soon is
your appointment?

39:04.810 --> 39:07.577
- I got an appointment with Dr. Now in 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes?

39:07.579 --> 39:10.013
All right, let's set
this up, okay?

39:11.048 --> 39:13.917
<i>I'm not gonna be able to
make it back down to Dr. Now</i>

39:13.919 --> 39:15.952
<i>at my scheduled time in a week.</i>

39:15.954 --> 39:18.621
<i>So, I called his office
and asked him</i>

39:18.623 --> 39:20.457
<i>if I could set up a video call</i>

39:22.460 --> 39:24.728
<i>and let him know what's
going on and communicate</i>

39:24.730 --> 39:26.596
<i>to him one on one
that I'm still dedicated</i>

39:26.598 --> 39:28.131
<i>to doing this program</i>

39:28.133 --> 39:30.300
<i>because I don't want him
wondering if there's an issue</i>

39:30.302 --> 39:31.267
<i>with my commitment,</i>

39:31.269 --> 39:32.969
<i>because there's not,</i>

39:32.971 --> 39:36.072
<i>I just got to take care of my
mom right now and be there for her.</i>

39:37.074 --> 39:38.875
What's going on, Dr. Now?

39:38.877 --> 39:40.009
<i>Hi, James, how are you doing?</i>

39:40.011 --> 39:42.579
I'm okay, Doc, how you doing?

39:42.581 --> 39:44.914
<i>I'm good, James.
Thank you for asking.</i>

39:44.916 --> 39:48.651
<i>Well, James, how is
your progress coming along?</i>

39:48.653 --> 39:49.853
It's good, Dr. Now.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.756
<i>Do you think
you lost any weight?</i>

39:52.758 --> 39:54.858
I think I'm doing well.
It's been hard,

39:54.860 --> 39:56.626
but I've been working at it.

39:56.628 --> 39:59.496
I feel much better from
the last time I seen you.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.898
And I feel like my stamina
went up with all the workouts

40:01.900 --> 40:05.902
that I've been doing. So, I
see all of that as progress.

40:05.904 --> 40:09.906
<i>Well, I'm glad to hear that,
but, James, it doesn't look</i>

40:09.908 --> 40:11.708
<i>like you have lost
a lot of weight.</i>

40:11.710 --> 40:13.410
<i>But, we'll find out</i>

40:13.412 --> 40:15.812
<i>when next week you get up
on the scale</i>

40:15.814 --> 40:19.716
<i>and as you're calling me to tell me
you wanna change your appointment?</i>

40:19.718 --> 40:21.718
Yes, Dr. Now, that's what I
wanted to talk to you about

40:21.720 --> 40:23.520
because I had a death
in the family.

40:23.522 --> 40:27.624
My father passed away
unexpectedly a couple of weeks ago.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.859
So, it's kind of difficult for me
to come and see you right now.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.761
So, I want to ask you
if it's possible that

40:31.763 --> 40:33.963
you can reschedule,
but I also want to tell you

40:33.965 --> 40:36.499
one on one that I've been
working really, really hard, Dr. Now.

40:36.501 --> 40:39.002
And I'm 100% committed
to completing your program.

40:39.004 --> 40:42.806
I'm just asking for more time,
just like another month, Dr. Now.

40:42.808 --> 40:45.341
And I would definitely, I
would really, really appreciate it

40:45.343 --> 40:48.111
if I could get more time,
so I can make more progress.

40:48.113 --> 40:52.215
<i>It seems you have made
progress, but not to your goal yet?</i>

40:52.217 --> 40:54.717
Yes, Dr. Now, because
I've been working hard,

40:54.719 --> 40:58.455
and I'm trying my best, but,
honestly, I think I've made progress.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.757
But, I think I could do
more progress.

41:00.759 --> 41:04.294
And I really want to meet
the goal that you gave me.

41:04.296 --> 41:07.430
<i>All right, James, considering
what you have going on.</i>

41:07.432 --> 41:08.698
<i>I'm going to give you
another month</i>

41:08.700 --> 41:11.501
<i>and I'm going to keep
your goal the same.</i>

41:11.503 --> 41:15.104
<i>You need to lose 75 pounds
by the next month,</i>

41:15.106 --> 41:17.974
<i>but you need to take
this seriously, no matter what</i>

41:17.976 --> 41:19.275
<i>you're going through.</i>

41:30.521 --> 41:32.455
<i>- Okay?
- Understood.</i>

41:32.457 --> 41:35.492
<i>The only thing that
will change is losing weight</i>

41:35.494 --> 41:38.161
<i>and hard time in your life
right now doesn't mean</i>

41:38.163 --> 41:42.799
<i>that it's acceptable
for not losing your weight.</i>

41:42.801 --> 41:44.667
No problem, Doc, I got you.

41:44.669 --> 41:47.570
I really want to do this and
then I'll come down to Texas

41:47.572 --> 41:50.607
and I'll prove to you and I'll
show you that I lost the weight.

41:50.609 --> 41:53.476
<i>All right, James, I'm sorry
for your loss</i>

41:53.478 --> 41:56.479
<i>and that you're going through
a hard time right now.</i>

41:56.481 --> 41:58.815
<i>If you need anything,
you may call,</i>

41:58.817 --> 42:03.119
<i>but otherwise, we'll see you in a
month and see how you're doing, okay?</i>

42:03.121 --> 42:05.054
No problem. Thank you, Doc.

42:05.956 --> 42:06.923
All right. Bye, James.

42:06.925 --> 42:08.491
Bye.

42:10.461 --> 42:12.862
<i>I understand the things
that Dr. Now was saying,</i>

42:12.864 --> 42:15.565
<i>but I feel like I was able
to communicate with him</i>

42:15.567 --> 42:18.167
<i>that I'm still committed
to his program</i>

42:18.169 --> 42:19.769
<i>and I'm not backing down
from it.</i>

42:19.771 --> 42:22.438
<i>And as soon as I can
and I'm able to move past</i>

42:22.440 --> 42:23.606
<i>this time of my life.</i>

42:23.608 --> 42:26.409
<i>I'm gonna be back down
and show him my progress.</i>

42:26.411 --> 42:28.711
<i>Because I know I have
to get my life right</i>

42:28.713 --> 42:31.481
<i>and I'm committed to doing
that, no matter what.</i>

42:44.128 --> 42:46.429
- You're tired?
- Mm-hmm.

42:46.431 --> 42:48.731
<i>I'm heading to Cheyenne's
place with her right now.</i>

42:48.733 --> 42:51.668
<i>She wanted me to get out
of the house because</i>

42:51.670 --> 42:53.136
<i>I've been struggling
with being depressed,</i>

42:53.138 --> 42:55.371
<i>with the loss of my dad still.</i>

42:56.173 --> 42:57.674
<i>It's been hard on me.</i>

42:57.676 --> 43:00.243
<i>I just been kind
of struggling more</i>

43:01.478 --> 43:03.513
<i>and she knows I don't like
going out in public.</i>

43:03.515 --> 43:06.583
<i>And I'm hoping it does
help me 'cause I know</i>

43:06.585 --> 43:09.485
<i>I have to get back at it
with Dr. Now's program,</i>

43:09.487 --> 43:12.188
<i>so I can have
weight loss surgery.</i>

43:13.457 --> 43:17.160
<i>My exercises been the
hardest to keep up with recently.</i>

43:17.162 --> 43:19.195
I put my stuff here.

43:29.139 --> 43:30.940
James.

43:30.942 --> 43:33.843
- What's cracking?
- Ain't nothing, what's up?

43:33.845 --> 43:36.212
Just chilling. What's new.
How was your week?

43:36.214 --> 43:38.081
I'm all right.
Yeah, I'm starving.

43:38.083 --> 43:40.149
You're always hungry.

43:40.151 --> 43:41.918
So, you want something to eat?

43:41.920 --> 43:43.586
Yeah, what you got?

43:43.588 --> 43:47.156
I got chicken, broccoli...

43:47.158 --> 43:51.227
- We could do jerk chicken...
- And broccoli?

43:53.831 --> 43:55.031
All right.

43:55.033 --> 43:57.934
And lemme give my hug
because I ain't give my hug yet.

43:57.936 --> 44:00.069
- Ah.
- Thank you, cuz, I appreciate you.

44:00.071 --> 44:01.904
No problem.

44:01.906 --> 44:03.573
So, you ready for Texas?

44:03.640 --> 44:04.974
Yeah, man.

44:07.778 --> 44:10.480
<i>I have two more weeks until
my rescheduled appointment</i>

44:10.482 --> 44:11.948
<i>with Dr. Now.</i>

44:11.950 --> 44:15.018
<i>I'm trying to be mindful
of the timeline I have</i>

44:15.020 --> 44:16.953
<i>to make the progress I need.</i>

44:16.955 --> 44:18.655
<i>I already got extra time.</i>

44:18.657 --> 44:22.425
<i>I have to make good
on what I'm supposed to do.</i>

44:22.427 --> 44:26.029
- James, you want it peppery?
- Yes, ma'am, I love with a little spice.

44:26.031 --> 44:27.764
<i>It's just been hard.</i>

44:27.766 --> 44:29.966
<i>You know, I got Cheyenne's
support.</i>

44:29.968 --> 44:33.870
<i>And she's been a big help.
And I'm thankful for that.</i>

44:33.872 --> 44:35.471
James, as long you stick
with it.

44:35.473 --> 44:37.807
Don't give up, you will succeed.

44:37.809 --> 44:40.476
I know I could do it.
I'm not gonna give up.

44:40.478 --> 44:42.011
You better not.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.579
I'm coming right now.
You ready?

44:43.581 --> 44:44.847
Yeah.

44:44.849 --> 44:47.083
'Cause support has been
integral for me.

44:47.085 --> 44:49.018
<i>It help keep me motivated.</i>

44:50.254 --> 44:52.088
See? And I wake up.

44:57.628 --> 44:58.961
Yum, yum, yum.

44:58.963 --> 45:00.630
Say a little prayer
before we eat.

45:00.632 --> 45:04.167
Lord, I pray that James
get to Texas safe.

45:04.169 --> 45:06.469
And he lets everybody knows that

45:06.471 --> 45:08.171
he's out there.

45:08.173 --> 45:11.441
Lord, I pray that
you granted us food to eat.

45:12.743 --> 45:15.044
- And, amen.
- Amen.

45:15.913 --> 45:18.047
- Hmm.
- It's good.

45:26.657 --> 45:28.725
<i>Yesterday, I called
Dr. Now's office</i>

45:28.727 --> 45:31.961
<i>- to be proactive again...
- [knocking at door]</i>

45:31.963 --> 45:33.830
<i>Because I know that
I wasn't going to be able</i>

45:33.832 --> 45:36.599
<i>to depart for Houston in time
to make my appointment</i>

45:36.601 --> 45:38.668
<i>I have with him next week.</i>

45:38.670 --> 45:40.470
<i>I know that it's going to be
a second time</i>

45:40.472 --> 45:43.473
<i>that I had to miss a scheduled
appointment with Dr. Now</i>

45:43.475 --> 45:45.641
<i>and that I'm pushing my
limits, but it's all been out</i>

45:45.643 --> 45:49.412
<i>of my hands because
of how my family has needed me</i>

45:49.414 --> 45:52.782
<i>and how hard this time
is still for all of us.</i>

45:52.784 --> 45:54.917
<i>And it's important to all
of us that we're together</i>

45:54.919 --> 45:56.185
<i>during this time</i>

45:56.187 --> 45:58.154
<i>to support each other.</i>

46:01.759 --> 46:03.960
What's up, bro?

46:03.962 --> 46:07.230
Just got back.
Just got your mail.

46:08.999 --> 46:11.234
[indistinct]

46:11.568 --> 46:13.970
<i>You know, I'm trying my best.</i>

46:13.972 --> 46:17.206
<i>And I thought having
another month will give me</i>

46:17.208 --> 46:18.841
<i>what I needed to get past this.</i>

46:18.843 --> 46:23.412
<i>Me and my whole family are
still dealing with a lot of grief.</i>

46:23.414 --> 46:25.948
<i>So, I have to have
a little more time</i>

46:25.950 --> 46:28.751
<i>and I know Dr. Now is not
gonna be happy about that request</i>

46:28.753 --> 46:30.520
<i>coming a second time.</i>

46:30.522 --> 46:33.723
<i>I'm hoping he's at least
understanding of my situation.</i>

46:33.725 --> 46:35.858
<i>And he sees that
I'm still just as committed</i>

46:35.860 --> 46:37.860
<i>and it's just life
and I'm doing what I can</i>

46:37.862 --> 46:40.830
<i>to keep moving and get back
to him to do his program.</i>

46:40.832 --> 46:42.498
All right, I'm seeing
nothing important.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.767
I got a doctor's appointment
to finish.

46:44.769 --> 46:47.637
I'm waiting for Cheyenne
to come through with the...

46:47.639 --> 46:50.673
the lap--
I got to invest in a laptop.

46:50.675 --> 46:53.109
- So, I definitely got to do because 'cause, uh...
- Yeah, yeah.

46:53.111 --> 46:55.344
I can't be having Cheyenne
coming from Brooklyn

46:55.746 --> 46:58.181
to bring the laptop over

46:58.183 --> 47:01.117
just for me to get
a doctor's appointment.

47:02.252 --> 47:03.853
[knocking at door]

47:03.855 --> 47:05.221
Who is it?

47:05.223 --> 47:06.489
Cheyenne.

47:06.690 --> 47:08.825
James.

47:08.827 --> 47:10.493
- Hey, James.
- Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

47:10.495 --> 47:11.994
I got a doctor's appointment.

47:11.996 --> 47:14.463
[Cheyenne] Well, let's see
what Dr. Now is going to say.

47:15.666 --> 47:19.001
Let's see, let's see, let's see.

47:19.003 --> 47:21.604
Since you got your appointment,
I'm just giving you your privacy.

47:21.606 --> 47:23.773
- Cool, cool, all right.
- I'll go in the back.

47:23.775 --> 47:27.677
I got some stuff in the fridge if you
want to have a drink or something?

47:27.679 --> 47:28.878
- No problem.
- Yeah, sure.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.447
I'll probably make me
something to eat.

47:31.449 --> 47:34.217
- Good looking, bro. I appreciate you.
- I'll be back.

47:36.653 --> 47:38.154
[Skype ringing]

47:43.160 --> 47:44.794
<i>Hello. Hi, James,
how you doing?</i>

47:44.796 --> 47:46.729
Hey, Dr. Now, what's going on?

47:46.731 --> 47:49.932
<i>Well, you tell me
because I was expecting that</i>

47:49.934 --> 47:53.002
<i>in one month,
you'll be coming down</i>

47:53.004 --> 47:56.439
<i>and visit us, but you wanted
to do a call again.</i>

47:56.441 --> 48:01.911
<i>So, apparently, there has been
more problem?</i>

48:01.913 --> 48:04.881
Yeah. This time, it's
still really tough for me.

48:04.883 --> 48:06.749
I'm just trying to take it
day by day.

48:06.751 --> 48:09.018
I got a lot of
obligations right now.

48:09.020 --> 48:11.888
So, to deal with my family
and that's got to be,

48:11.890 --> 48:13.756
like, my main focus right now.

48:13.758 --> 48:17.727
<i>Well, I'm sorry to hear that
and I'm sorry that</i>

48:17.729 --> 48:20.096
<i>your family is going through
all that.</i>

48:20.098 --> 48:25.067
<i>But then, the issue
is that your health</i>

48:25.069 --> 48:28.137
<i>cannot go by the wayside.</i>

48:28.139 --> 48:29.639
<i>Because that any time,</i>

48:29.641 --> 48:33.743
<i>any number of small issues
can push your body past its limit</i>

48:33.745 --> 48:38.614
<i>and if that happens, this is
not going to be a situation</i>

48:38.616 --> 48:41.584
<i>that you're going
to be able to survive.</i>

48:41.586 --> 48:45.388
<i>So, soon, it's going to be very
dangerous situation for you.</i>

48:51.662 --> 48:54.463
Doc, I'm not, I'm not,
I'm not giving up.

48:54.465 --> 48:55.698
I just need more time right now.

48:55.700 --> 48:58.000
So, I could spend with my
family as we grieve right now.

48:58.002 --> 49:01.037
You know, I'm trying, but
I got a lot on my shoulders

49:01.039 --> 49:04.140
and my family is
my main focus right now.

49:04.142 --> 49:06.876
<i>I didn't say I think
you've given up, James.</i>

49:06.878 --> 49:09.045
<i>That's not the issue.</i>

49:09.047 --> 49:11.847
<i>The issue is you can't afford
to keep using life</i>

49:11.849 --> 49:14.550
<i>as an excuse not to get healthy</i>

49:14.552 --> 49:17.219
<i>because we don't have
a lot of time at your weight.</i>

49:17.221 --> 49:19.622
<i>So, you need to take
this seriously</i>

49:19.624 --> 49:23.626
<i>and do this stuff before you
run out of time and it's too late.</i>

49:23.628 --> 49:25.628
I'm really taking
it serious, Doc.

49:25.630 --> 49:27.997
It's just that I'm just dealing
with tragedy right now.

49:27.999 --> 49:29.699
But, I'm still doing
everything I need, you know,

49:29.701 --> 49:32.435
I'm a do it. I just need time.

49:32.437 --> 49:37.907
<i>All right, James, I'm willing to move
your appointment for another month again</i>

49:37.909 --> 49:40.643
<i>because of your situation
and your family.</i>

49:40.645 --> 49:42.678
Thank you, Doc.
I appreciate it.

49:42.680 --> 49:45.448
<i>If we do that, would you
be able to do that by then?</i>

49:45.450 --> 49:47.616
Yeah, definitely for sure.

49:47.618 --> 49:48.651
<i>All right, James.</i>

49:48.653 --> 49:50.786
<i>So, I want to keep
your goal the same,</i>

49:50.788 --> 49:54.290
<i>to lose 75 pounds
in over the next month.</i>

49:54.292 --> 49:56.459
<i>But, even if you hit your goal,</i>

49:56.461 --> 49:59.729
<i>you're gonna have to make sure
and if you're gonna stick with it.</i>

49:59.731 --> 50:02.231
<i>And show me you can do that
before I approve you</i>

50:02.233 --> 50:03.566
<i>for weight loss surgery.</i>

50:03.568 --> 50:06.002
<i>Because, this will be
four months now</i>

50:06.004 --> 50:08.904
<i>that I've given you
to lose 75 pounds.</i>

50:08.906 --> 50:13.876
<i>So, you have a lot of hard work to do to
show me that you're ready to move ahead.</i>

50:13.878 --> 50:15.911
I understand it, Doc.
I got it. I got it.

50:15.913 --> 50:18.848
I will. I got you
and I thank you

50:18.850 --> 50:22.952
for granting me more time
and I appreciate that.

50:22.954 --> 50:24.754
<i>Okay, James,
I'll see you in a month</i>

50:24.756 --> 50:27.690
<i>and if you need anything,
before then, you may call.</i>

50:27.692 --> 50:29.025
No problem, Doc. Thanks a lot.

50:29.027 --> 50:31.193
<i>You're welcome
and you take care.</i>

50:31.195 --> 50:32.962
- You too, Doc.
<i>- Bye now.</i>

50:32.964 --> 50:34.096
Later.

50:40.504 --> 50:42.037
[sighs]

50:48.578 --> 50:52.815
<i>I'm glad Doc understood, but I
know he's doubting me right now.</i>

50:52.817 --> 50:54.850
<i>And I'm gonna prove to him
that I mean everything</i>

50:54.852 --> 50:55.951
<i>that I'm saying.</i>

50:55.953 --> 50:57.586
<i>You know, I'm gonna get
past this</i>

50:57.588 --> 50:59.822
<i>and come out the other end.</i>

50:59.824 --> 51:01.557
<i>And it just takes time
and I can't control that.</i>

51:01.559 --> 51:04.427
<i>But, I'm still doing what
I need to stay on track.</i>

51:04.429 --> 51:08.030
<i>And here soon, I know I'm
going to be able to go back down</i>

51:08.032 --> 51:11.067
<i>and show him the proof of
all I've been saying to him.</i>

51:24.815 --> 51:27.249
I'm in Texas right now. Um...

51:27.984 --> 51:29.852
I'm gonna see the doctor.

51:29.854 --> 51:31.454
We in the beehive.

51:31.721 --> 51:33.022
You know.

51:33.390 --> 51:37.293
This is Beyoncé's territory.
Probably not here, but, you know...

51:39.129 --> 51:41.931
<i>Dr. Now told me I was pushing
my limits of my timeframe,</i>

51:41.933 --> 51:44.767
<i>not having a follow up.</i>

51:44.769 --> 51:47.736
<i>You know, I've been trying
to plan to come down.</i>

51:47.738 --> 51:49.738
<i>But, my family's still been
struggling.</i>

51:49.740 --> 51:51.874
<i>So, I know I was going
to need more time.</i>

51:51.876 --> 51:54.977
<i>But, I couldn't bring myself
to call Dr. Now</i>

51:54.979 --> 51:56.745
<i>and tell him the same thing
for a third time.</i>

51:56.747 --> 51:58.214
<i>So, I avoided it.</i>

51:58.216 --> 52:00.716
<i>But then, he called me
and told me I need to commit</i>

52:00.718 --> 52:02.284
<i>or move on.</i>

52:03.753 --> 52:06.122
<i>But Dr. Now told me
I had too much time.</i>

52:06.756 --> 52:08.257
<i>So I'm back down now.</i>

52:08.259 --> 52:11.460
<i>I did it. I came here.</i>

52:18.635 --> 52:20.269
[clears throat]

52:25.075 --> 52:28.911
<i>This time we flew
and I think being able to get</i>

52:28.913 --> 52:31.714
<i>on the plane was wearing on me</i>

52:31.716 --> 52:33.315
<i>and it took a lot out of me,</i>

52:34.151 --> 52:36.252
<i>but I handled it well, you know.</i>

52:40.557 --> 52:42.958
- James.
- Yes.

52:45.996 --> 52:49.431
<i>And, hopefully, I'm going to be
able to show Dr. Now the progress.</i>

52:53.770 --> 52:55.938
Go ahead and step on.

53:00.944 --> 53:03.512
<i>At my last appointment,
I was at 625</i>

53:03.514 --> 53:07.316
<i>and Dr. Now gave me
a 75 pound weight loss goal.</i>

53:09.119 --> 53:12.154
<i>And if I made that,
I'm gonna be under 550 today.</i>

53:16.026 --> 53:17.760
We're gonna go to room
number five.

53:17.762 --> 53:19.995
- Thank you.
<i>- That's progress at least.</i>

53:19.997 --> 53:22.831
<i>I thought it'd be more,
but I made it to the 500,</i>

53:22.833 --> 53:25.201
<i>so, I feel good about that.</i>

53:25.203 --> 53:27.369
<i>I know, Dr. Now will probably
be focused on</i>

53:27.371 --> 53:29.705
<i>how it's not fully to my goal,</i>

53:29.707 --> 53:32.007
<i>but at least I could show him
that I'm moving in the direction</i>

53:32.009 --> 53:35.144
<i>he told me to improve my life.</i>

53:35.146 --> 53:37.913
<i>Even with everything going on,</i>

53:37.915 --> 53:39.048
<i>this shows a lot of effort,</i>

53:39.050 --> 53:42.051
<i>even if it's not where
he told me to get,</i>

53:42.053 --> 53:44.453
<i>but I'm happy to, at least,
be losing</i>

53:44.455 --> 53:46.755
<i>and I'm able to show him
that today.</i>

53:46.757 --> 53:48.791
<i>And, hopefully, it's enough
for him.</i>

53:48.793 --> 53:50.392
[knocking at door]

53:50.694 --> 53:53.095
- Hello.
- Hello.

53:53.097 --> 53:55.097
- Dr. Now, how are you doing, Dr. Now?
- I'm doing good.

53:55.099 --> 53:56.131
How y'all doing?

53:56.133 --> 53:57.933
- Okay.
- Fine.

53:57.935 --> 53:59.268
All right.

53:59.270 --> 54:02.037
James, how are
you getting along?

54:02.105 --> 54:04.173
Um, I mean,

54:04.941 --> 54:06.675
I guess I'm getting along okay.

54:06.677 --> 54:07.876
How you holding up
with the stress?

54:07.878 --> 54:10.679
You know, not easy
losing a parent.

54:10.681 --> 54:13.949
That was like the blow,
you know, but I'm just trying

54:13.951 --> 54:15.985
to get it, I'm just trying
to get through it, that's it.

54:15.987 --> 54:17.119
Just trying to get through it.

54:17.121 --> 54:19.655
Well, I'm glad you made it
back down here

54:19.657 --> 54:21.457
and that you lost some weight.

54:21.459 --> 54:23.826
- That's what it looked like.
- Well, you know,

54:23.828 --> 54:26.996
it's been about six months
and you lost 28 pounds,

54:26.998 --> 54:29.431
that's about four to five
pounds a month.

54:29.433 --> 54:31.700
And which is not
very big weight loss.

54:31.702 --> 54:35.571
So, you're still eating, like,
four to 5000 calories a day.

54:35.573 --> 54:39.341
So, you need to cut back on
that and get your weight down

54:39.343 --> 54:41.944
because the situation
could still become critical

54:41.946 --> 54:44.680
at any moment
and losing weight that slowly

54:44.682 --> 54:46.548
isn't going to avoid that.

54:46.550 --> 54:49.618
That means that the time
is the essence for you.

54:49.620 --> 54:53.255
And you have to speed up the
process of getting your weight down.

54:53.257 --> 54:57.326
- Right, right.
- So, you need to keep making changes to your diet.

54:57.328 --> 54:58.894
I did, Dr. Now.

54:58.896 --> 55:02.831
It's just with my father passing,
it got harder and I slipped up.

55:02.833 --> 55:06.735
James, you need to decide if
you want to change your life or not.

55:06.737 --> 55:09.438
Because at the current rate
of your progress,

55:09.440 --> 55:12.941
being almost 600 pounds, you
know, you got a long way to go.

55:12.943 --> 55:14.743
That'll be 10 years
before you get there.

55:14.745 --> 55:16.478
If I lose it, you're right,
you're right.

55:16.480 --> 55:20.316
All right? So what changes you
have made on your eating habit?

55:20.318 --> 55:24.019
Um, what I did was
I stopped eating out, really.

55:24.021 --> 55:26.722
I stopped eating out, I started
just like cooking my own meals

55:26.724 --> 55:29.458
and I'm preparing my own stuff

55:29.460 --> 55:32.761
and stayed away from
fried foods and stuff like that.

55:32.763 --> 55:34.830
And, so, I kind of took
control of what I was eating

55:34.832 --> 55:38.801
instead of just buying it and
getting it delivered and stuff.

55:38.803 --> 55:41.503
So, I made sure that I, you
know, everything stayed healthy.

55:41.505 --> 55:43.972
I ate salads, vegetables,

55:43.974 --> 55:47.576
um, and a lot of full grilled,
I bought me, um...

55:47.578 --> 55:49.445
I bought me an air fryer.

55:49.447 --> 55:51.880
So, now with the air fryer,
everything is done in the air fryer.

55:51.882 --> 55:55.484
Takes away the grease, and
it's a much healthier option.

55:55.486 --> 55:58.120
- No, but you're still eating too many calories.
- Okay.

55:58.122 --> 56:01.156
Do you have the support
of your family to help you

56:01.158 --> 56:02.057
improve your eating habits?

56:02.059 --> 56:04.927
Yes, Cheyenne has been
helping me out.

56:04.929 --> 56:05.894
She helps me out
when she come around.

56:05.896 --> 56:07.696
Okay, that's good.

56:07.698 --> 56:09.565
You don't seem to have
a weight problem,

56:09.567 --> 56:12.968
so are you able to have
positive influence on him?

56:12.970 --> 56:16.672
I'm the one that convinced him to
get an air fryer to cook for himself.

56:16.674 --> 56:19.541
So, he can know where
he's putting inside his body.

56:19.543 --> 56:20.943
Instead of just eating out
'cause when you eat out,

56:20.945 --> 56:23.011
you don't really know
what's going in it.

56:23.013 --> 56:26.448
Well, that's good because
James seems like he needs

56:26.450 --> 56:28.884
a lot of help and reinforcement.

56:28.886 --> 56:32.454
Yeah, but, recently he's been
going through a lot of problems

56:32.456 --> 56:34.189
like family wise.

56:34.191 --> 56:36.558
-So, his pop's
-I understand that, but...

56:36.560 --> 56:38.127
just recently passed.

56:38.129 --> 56:40.596
I know it's been a hard time.
I understand that.

56:40.598 --> 56:44.767
But, you know, no event in
life justified to be unhealthy

56:44.769 --> 56:47.569
because, you know,
if he's not healthy,

56:47.571 --> 56:51.440
he's going to be next
tragedy in family too.

56:51.442 --> 56:54.510
- You're right about that.
- And that's not something good.

56:54.512 --> 56:56.879
So, no matter the circumstances

56:56.881 --> 57:00.682
or excuses, there's still
gonna be the same consequences

57:00.684 --> 57:02.251
to unhealthy choices.

57:02.253 --> 57:04.820
So, you know, to convince
yourself that

57:04.822 --> 57:06.889
I'm going to eat whatever,
whenever because

57:06.891 --> 57:09.024
there is so much stress
in my life,

57:09.026 --> 57:11.660
it's not gonna end well
because it will just be

57:11.662 --> 57:12.995
a vicious cycle.

57:12.997 --> 57:15.998
Like, you mentioned the first
time you were here, James.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.633
You get depressed and then
you eat.

57:17.635 --> 57:19.101
All right.

57:19.103 --> 57:21.804
But I set you up to
talk to Dr. Paradise about

57:21.806 --> 57:23.172
what you're going through.

57:23.174 --> 57:24.606
You're right, Doc, I got it.

57:24.608 --> 57:27.075
All right, so, James,
here's the deal,

57:27.077 --> 57:28.677
as long as you're not
losing weight

57:28.679 --> 57:30.479
and you live so far from here.

57:30.481 --> 57:32.548
There's no point for you
to come down and visit

57:32.550 --> 57:33.949
if you're not losing any weight.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.851
- All right.
- So, we're gotta make arrangement

57:35.853 --> 57:38.954
that we check your weight
in a clinic up there

57:38.956 --> 57:41.490
- Okay.
- And make sure that you're making good progress

57:41.492 --> 57:43.125
before you come back now here.

57:43.127 --> 57:46.361
Because if you don't eat
properly and you don't lose weight,

57:46.363 --> 57:48.630
the surgery is not going
to be a good option for you.

57:48.632 --> 57:51.867
- All right.
- And so, if we are not going to move ahead with you,

57:51.869 --> 57:53.735
there's no need to keep
doing this, okay?

57:53.737 --> 57:56.738
So, tighten up
your eating habit more.

57:56.740 --> 58:00.042
Eat two or three times a day, make
sure you don't eat between the meals.

58:00.044 --> 58:03.045
- Okay.
- And do daily exercise and if you do that,

58:03.047 --> 58:05.414
you can easily lose
30 pounds a month.

58:05.416 --> 58:06.548
- Okay.
- Okay?

58:06.550 --> 58:09.551
Let's raise it your weight
and lose 30 pounds a month

58:09.553 --> 58:12.454
in three months, you should be
able to lose 100 pounds.

58:12.456 --> 58:16.024
So, what I want to see at a
minimum over the next few months

58:16.026 --> 58:19.027
is for you to lose
the other 50 pounds

58:19.029 --> 58:20.896
you owe me from the goal
I gave you.

58:20.898 --> 58:21.997
- Okay?
- Okay.

58:21.999 --> 58:24.900
So, we arranged to have
a clinic up there

58:24.902 --> 58:26.835
and if you stay
with the program,

58:26.837 --> 58:28.136
you're able to lose
enough weight

58:28.138 --> 58:30.038
then we get to come down here.

58:30.040 --> 58:32.808
- Okay.
- But, there's no point of coming down here,

58:32.810 --> 58:35.544
unless we have a meaningful
weight loss,

58:35.546 --> 58:37.446
and I've got to be necessary,
okay?

58:37.448 --> 58:41.783
- Got it.
- Stick to 1200 calorie diet and do your exercises.

58:41.785 --> 58:43.018
- Thank you.
- All right.

58:43.020 --> 58:45.754
And if you need anything
before then, let me know.

58:45.756 --> 58:46.955
Okay. No problem, Doctor.
Thank you.

58:46.957 --> 58:49.024
- Thank you so much, Doc.
- All right.

58:49.026 --> 58:50.726
- We'll see you later.
- All right, Doc.

58:50.728 --> 58:52.828
- See you later.
- Bye now.

58:52.830 --> 58:53.996
- Later.
- Later.

59:01.104 --> 59:03.005
You okay?

59:03.573 --> 59:06.642
I'm glad James at least
made some progress,

59:06.644 --> 59:09.678
<i>but it is clear he's still
been lacking the motivation</i>

59:09.680 --> 59:11.747
<i>he needs to turn
his life around.</i>

59:11.749 --> 59:15.584
<i>I know this has been a hard
time for him and his family.</i>

59:15.586 --> 59:19.621
<i>But, using his circumstances
as an excuse to overeat</i>

59:19.623 --> 59:23.292
and go to food for comfort
is nothing new for James.

59:23.294 --> 59:26.061
<i>This is all just part
of the same pattern,</i>

59:26.063 --> 59:30.566
<i>an unhealthy cycle he's been
following for most of his life.</i>

59:30.568 --> 59:32.801
So, he's going to have
to decide if he wants

59:32.803 --> 59:35.737
to keep making excuses
or do what he needs

59:35.739 --> 59:38.273
to get healthy no matter <i>what.</i>

59:40.043 --> 59:42.311
<i>[James] I get Dr. Now and what
he's saying,</i>

59:42.313 --> 59:43.912
<i>I know he's right.</i>

59:43.914 --> 59:46.148
<i>It's just easier said than done.</i>

59:46.549 --> 59:47.883
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

59:47.885 --> 59:50.886
<i>But, I'm gonna go back
and do better and take care</i>

59:50.888 --> 59:52.554
<i>of my health.</i>

59:52.556 --> 59:55.324
<i>Because, I can't let it fall
by the wayside.</i>

59:58.828 --> 1:00:02.931
<i>So, as hard as it was to come
back down here at this time,</i>

1:00:02.933 --> 1:00:04.733
<i>I'm glad I did because</i>

1:00:04.735 --> 1:00:07.436
<i>I think it's helping me snap
out of it to do what I need.</i>

1:00:17.747 --> 1:00:20.182
- Hey, James.
- Hey, James.

1:00:20.184 --> 1:00:23.652
James, let's go, let's go,
let's go.

1:00:23.654 --> 1:00:25.754
- Let's go.
- You ready?

1:00:25.756 --> 1:00:30.092
Let's go to the park, oh.
Let's go.

1:00:30.660 --> 1:00:32.127
[James] That crazy.

1:00:32.129 --> 1:00:35.697
- Exercise.
- All right, I mean, let's go, I mean...

1:00:35.699 --> 1:00:37.633
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1:00:37.635 --> 1:00:41.103
<i>Since coming back from my
last appointment with Dr. Now,</i>

1:00:41.105 --> 1:00:44.139
<i>I tried to get my motivation
up to do better.</i>

1:00:44.574 --> 1:00:47.009
Did I bring my phone?

1:00:47.011 --> 1:00:49.277
All right, these are
the stairs of hell.

1:00:52.081 --> 1:00:52.981
Let's go.

1:00:52.983 --> 1:00:55.450
- Up the stairs.
- Let's go to the park.

1:00:55.452 --> 1:00:58.220
Yes, this exercise
has now begun.

1:01:02.625 --> 1:01:04.926
<i>[James] I still can't make the
walk all the way to the park.</i>

1:01:04.928 --> 1:01:06.762
<i>Even though it's just
a few minutes' drive away.</i>

1:01:06.764 --> 1:01:09.131
<i>So, we have to get a ride
for that.</i>

1:01:09.133 --> 1:01:13.068
<i>But I know if I keep this up,
I'll be able to handle that walk</i>

1:01:13.135 --> 1:01:15.037
<i>real soon.</i>

1:01:33.122 --> 1:01:35.057
<i>Man, that's a bus stop.</i>

1:01:35.059 --> 1:01:37.025
<i>Gone.</i>

1:01:38.928 --> 1:01:42.330
- Middle seat.
- Middle seat.

1:01:44.067 --> 1:01:46.668
<i>Getting out and just
going outside and sitting in</i>

1:01:46.670 --> 1:01:48.570
<i>the park felt great.</i>

1:01:48.572 --> 1:01:50.739
<i>I used to love that
before I got too big.</i>

1:01:50.741 --> 1:01:54.876
<i>And I stopped doing things
like that years ago.</i>

1:01:54.878 --> 1:01:58.313
<i>Before I went to see Dr. Now,
it'd been half a year or longer</i>

1:01:58.315 --> 1:02:00.882
<i>since I've been out of my place.</i>

1:02:00.884 --> 1:02:04.619
<i>So, this helps me feel like
things is just almost normal again.</i>

1:02:04.621 --> 1:02:06.755
<i>But, the moment usually
turns on me.</i>

1:02:06.757 --> 1:02:08.824
<i>That's the part that
starts when I get</i>

1:02:08.826 --> 1:02:11.393
<i>that first look from someone.</i>

1:02:11.395 --> 1:02:14.730
<i>Where I know what they
thinking and it's not positive,</i>

1:02:14.732 --> 1:02:19.267
<i>so that part makes coming
outside a different experience.</i>

1:02:19.869 --> 1:02:23.171
<i>I kind of feel like
it ruins the moment for me.</i>

1:02:23.173 --> 1:02:26.742
No, that stupid [bleep]
lookin' at us like I'm [bleep]

1:02:26.744 --> 1:02:28.210
And I'm [bleep] no more, yo.

1:02:28.212 --> 1:02:30.545
Don't worry about her,
she look like

1:02:30.547 --> 1:02:32.380
an animal herself.

1:02:32.382 --> 1:02:34.950
- And nobody's actually really looking at you.
- Yeah.

1:02:34.952 --> 1:02:38.920
<i>In society, they're normal,
I'm not normal, obviously.</i>

1:02:38.922 --> 1:02:41.389
So, how can you preach to me
and tell me it's okay,

1:02:41.391 --> 1:02:42.724
they're not looking at me.

1:02:42.726 --> 1:02:45.894
They're not looking at you. It
sucks like nobody understands.

1:02:45.896 --> 1:02:47.929
<i>I've been locked up in a house
for a minute,</i>

1:02:47.931 --> 1:02:49.831
<i>so to be around all these people</i>

1:02:49.833 --> 1:02:52.300
and be in a city like this...

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:56.071
it's hard, it's hard,
it's, you know.

1:02:56.073 --> 1:02:59.474
I know you feel uncomfortable
right now, but this is a big step.

1:03:00.576 --> 1:03:02.978
It's just one step at a time.

1:03:02.980 --> 1:03:04.713
<i>At one point, I couldn't even
walk to my kitchen.</i>

1:03:04.715 --> 1:03:07.249
So, for me to be able
to come outside,

1:03:07.251 --> 1:03:10.786
come down the stairs,
able to walk back and forth.

1:03:10.788 --> 1:03:13.722
Feel a little better, I'm not
there where I need to be.

1:03:13.724 --> 1:03:15.624
But it's a progress in motion.

1:03:15.626 --> 1:03:18.527
<i>So, that encourages me
because I want to do</i>

1:03:18.529 --> 1:03:20.428
<i>Dr. Now's program
and get his help.</i>

1:03:20.430 --> 1:03:22.831
<i>So, I'm trying to get on track
to do that.</i>

1:03:22.833 --> 1:03:26.635
<i>I missed the mark last time
and I don't want to do that again.</i>

1:03:26.637 --> 1:03:28.170
<i>And I know to make sure of that,</i>

1:03:28.172 --> 1:03:29.905
<i>I have to try harder
and do better.</i>

1:03:29.907 --> 1:03:32.207
<i>So, that is my focus.</i>

1:03:48.791 --> 1:03:51.193
<i>I'm gonna be talking
to the therapist today.</i>

1:03:51.994 --> 1:03:53.862
Here, James.

1:03:53.864 --> 1:03:56.031
Here is your, here's the laptop.

1:03:56.033 --> 1:03:58.166
You got an appointment.

1:03:59.101 --> 1:04:00.969
Here's your bottle of water.

1:04:01.737 --> 1:04:02.871
Thank you.

1:04:02.873 --> 1:04:05.740
<i>He's going to talk to me
about my depression,</i>

1:04:05.742 --> 1:04:10.645
<i>with the death of my father and
my emotions and stuff like that.</i>

1:04:10.647 --> 1:04:13.849
<i>And I'm hoping it will be
a step that helps me today.</i>

1:04:13.851 --> 1:04:17.018
<i>So, I'm gonna start moving
past this place I'm in</i>

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:20.755
<i>because it's been messing me
up in so many ways.</i>

1:04:20.757 --> 1:04:21.723
<i>And I'm just ready to move on.</i>

1:04:21.725 --> 1:04:23.291
<i>I just don't know how.</i>

1:04:23.293 --> 1:04:27.462
<i>So, hopefully, this will lead me
in a direction to help me do that.</i>

1:04:27.930 --> 1:04:30.198
[Skype ringing]

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:32.734
<i>Hi there, James.</i>

1:04:32.736 --> 1:04:33.835
How you doing?

1:04:33.870 --> 1:04:36.838
<i>I'm well. Tell me
a little bit about yourself.</i>

1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:37.772
<i>I don't know that much
about you.</i>

1:04:37.774 --> 1:04:40.942
I'm 38. I'm from Brooklyn,
New York.

1:04:40.944 --> 1:04:43.912
<i>- So, you grew up in Brooklyn?
- Yeah, born and raised.</i>

1:04:43.914 --> 1:04:45.914
<i>So, tell me about your house
growing up,</i>

1:04:45.916 --> 1:04:48.250
<i>who lived in your house
with you?</i>

1:04:48.252 --> 1:04:50.585
Um, growing up, yeah,
my mother, my grandmother,

1:04:50.587 --> 1:04:52.921
my cousin.

1:04:52.923 --> 1:04:58.059
Uh, rest in peace to him and
my brother. And me. That's it.

1:04:58.061 --> 1:04:59.160
<i>What happened to your cousin?</i>

1:04:59.162 --> 1:05:01.463
He died. He, um, he was sick.

1:05:01.465 --> 1:05:02.664
He had, like, kidney failure.

1:05:02.666 --> 1:05:06.334
<i>- When did, when did that happen?
- 2005.</i>

1:05:06.336 --> 1:05:08.803
<i>That sounds like that was a big
thing in your life when you lost him.</i>

1:05:08.805 --> 1:05:10.005
Yeah.

1:05:10.007 --> 1:05:13.475
He ain't the only one I lost.
I just buried my dad.

1:05:13.477 --> 1:05:14.976
<i>- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.</i>

1:05:14.978 --> 1:05:16.211
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1:05:16.213 --> 1:05:17.812
<i>How did your dad pass?</i>

1:05:17.814 --> 1:05:18.880
Um, his heart stopped.

1:05:18.882 --> 1:05:21.917
He fell and his heart stopped.
And then that was it.

1:05:21.919 --> 1:05:24.019
It just stopped. He, we
tried to resuscitate him,

1:05:24.021 --> 1:05:25.987
but it didn't work.

1:05:25.989 --> 1:05:27.856
<i>Wow. How are you doing
with that?</i>

1:05:27.858 --> 1:05:30.926
It ain't done away, you know
what I'm saying? I mean...

1:05:30.928 --> 1:05:32.761
<i>- You felt connected to him?
- Yeah.</i>

1:05:32.763 --> 1:05:34.496
Who was feeding you, James?

1:05:34.498 --> 1:05:36.831
My mom fed me a lot, like,
when she was home,

1:05:36.833 --> 1:05:39.567
my mom worked, but, you know,
she come home at night.

1:05:39.569 --> 1:05:40.835
- And...
<i>- Okay.</i>

1:05:40.837 --> 1:05:43.772
She'd come home, she'll
feed me and it would be like

1:05:43.774 --> 1:05:44.673
large portions
because we eat rice.

1:05:44.675 --> 1:05:46.608
Our culture eat rice.

1:05:46.610 --> 1:05:50.578
- We eat heavy.
<i>- They were never worried about your weight?</i>

1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:53.715
Now she is, back then,
then it wasn't that big of a deal

1:05:53.717 --> 1:05:56.785
because I wasn't fat,
like, big like this.

1:05:56.787 --> 1:05:59.054
<i>So, how do you think
you got so big?</i>

1:05:59.056 --> 1:06:00.889
You know what, my weight
and stuff like that.

1:06:00.891 --> 1:06:02.123
I've been very depressed.

1:06:02.458 --> 1:06:03.992
- Um...
<i>- Sure.</i>

1:06:04.059 --> 1:06:06.962
Maybe because of that,
because, like, I don't go nowhere.

1:06:06.964 --> 1:06:08.930
I sit in the house.

1:06:08.932 --> 1:06:11.900
And it's like everybody, like
the world is moving without me.

1:06:11.902 --> 1:06:13.668
That's how I feel.

1:06:13.670 --> 1:06:15.870
Like, the only time I can
see them having fun

1:06:15.872 --> 1:06:19.607
is if I call them
and I'm FaceTiming with them

1:06:19.609 --> 1:06:21.876
and they they all are enjoying
they life and I'm in the bed

1:06:21.878 --> 1:06:25.780
watching television or whatever.

1:06:25.782 --> 1:06:28.483
<i>Are you so big that
you can't really get around?</i>

1:06:28.485 --> 1:06:31.586
I could get around, but as I
have a, like, anxiety issue,

1:06:31.588 --> 1:06:35.457
like, I hate when people
look at me, it makes me mad.

1:06:35.459 --> 1:06:38.693
<i>Yeah, it sounds like you're in
the house for multiple reasons.</i>

1:06:38.695 --> 1:06:41.796
<i>What is your size, but
then maybe a little anxiety</i>

1:06:41.798 --> 1:06:42.931
<i>about people looking at you?</i>

1:06:42.933 --> 1:06:44.566
Yeah, definitely.

1:06:44.568 --> 1:06:46.701
I feel like a fish
in a fish bowl.

1:06:46.703 --> 1:06:49.938
<i>It's interesting, James,
because the very thing</i>

1:06:49.940 --> 1:06:52.007
<i>that's gonna make that better.</i>

1:06:52.009 --> 1:06:53.408
<i>It's gonna help you lose
the weight,</i>

1:06:53.410 --> 1:06:56.011
<i>it's the thing that
you're afraid to do,</i>

1:06:56.013 --> 1:06:58.813
<i>which is to get more active
and to be more engaged.</i>

1:06:58.815 --> 1:07:01.549
<i>Being up in that apartment
by yourself.</i>

1:07:01.551 --> 1:07:04.285
<i>I think that's where
the weight came on.</i>

1:07:04.287 --> 1:07:08.390
<i>Is, is getting outside
most days is probably</i>

1:07:08.392 --> 1:07:09.758
<i>your number one homework.</i>

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:13.695
<i>So, James, can I get you to
commit to spending some time</i>

1:07:13.697 --> 1:07:15.663
<i>outside, maybe going
to visit a park?</i>

1:07:15.665 --> 1:07:17.832
Sure, yeah, I could
commit to that.

1:07:17.834 --> 1:07:19.134
<i>- Okay.
- I could commit to that, yeah.</i>

1:07:19.802 --> 1:07:22.904
<i>I want to come up with a
homework related to your dad.</i>

1:07:22.906 --> 1:07:24.773
<i>Is he buried somewhere?</i>

1:07:24.775 --> 1:07:26.708
Yeah, he, um, in Brooklyn.

1:07:26.710 --> 1:07:29.711
<i>If you're going to go visit
your dad's grave,</i>

1:07:29.713 --> 1:07:32.981
<i>I want you to put
a little something together.</i>

1:07:32.983 --> 1:07:35.917
- Okay.
<i>- Make a note or a poem or something.</i>

1:07:35.919 --> 1:07:39.888
<i>Something that you can say
to him when you're there.</i>

1:07:39.890 --> 1:07:41.790
- Okay.
<i>- It seems like you really loved him.</i>

1:07:41.792 --> 1:07:42.824
Yeah.

1:07:42.826 --> 1:07:46.728
- He's my father, man.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1:07:46.730 --> 1:07:48.930
<i>And, you know, one of the,
one of the very best things</i>

1:07:48.932 --> 1:07:50.999
<i>you can do to honor his memory,</i>

1:07:51.001 --> 1:07:53.701
<i>- is to lose the weight and live on.
- Yes.</i>

1:07:53.703 --> 1:07:55.003
<i>And be successful.</i>

1:07:55.005 --> 1:07:58.073
- Yes.
<i>- I'm sure that's what he wanted for you.</i>

1:07:58.075 --> 1:08:00.308
No, I know that's
what he wanted for me.

1:08:01.010 --> 1:08:02.710
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1:08:02.712 --> 1:08:03.912
<i>Okay.</i>

1:08:03.914 --> 1:08:05.113
<i>James, been really good
talking to you.</i>

1:08:05.115 --> 1:08:07.282
All right, Dr. Paradise.
All right.

1:08:13.923 --> 1:08:16.124
This was very interesting.

1:08:19.762 --> 1:08:22.330
I'll write a letter when
I get a chance, I'll...

1:08:30.306 --> 1:08:31.973
All right, I'm cool.

1:08:35.611 --> 1:08:38.780
<i>I think the conversation I had
with Dr. Paradise was good for me,</i>

1:08:38.782 --> 1:08:40.915
<i>because I feel like he gave me
some insight</i>

1:08:40.917 --> 1:08:43.518
<i>on some steps to do to try
and move forward</i>

1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:46.788
<i>and give me some things
to think about with myself.</i>

1:08:46.790 --> 1:08:50.792
<i>So, I'm going to do all that I
can with my diet and exercises,</i>

1:08:50.794 --> 1:08:52.861
<i>and what Dr. Paradise
discussed with me today.</i>

1:08:52.863 --> 1:08:55.997
<i>And, hopefully, it'll do
what they intended to do,</i>

1:08:55.999 --> 1:08:59.000
<i>by helping me get to where
I need because</i>

1:08:59.002 --> 1:09:00.235
<i>I know I'm running out of time.</i>

1:09:12.515 --> 1:09:15.250
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah.

1:09:15.252 --> 1:09:17.886
<i>Me and Cheyenne is going
to the pier today.</i>

1:09:17.888 --> 1:09:20.522
<i>I'm going there to write
a letter to my dad</i>

1:09:20.524 --> 1:09:23.191
<i>that Dr. Paradise
discussed with me.</i>

1:09:23.193 --> 1:09:25.660
<i>I decided to go there
and do it and read it.</i>

1:09:25.662 --> 1:09:28.696
<i>Because my dad took me there
a lot when I was young.</i>

1:09:28.698 --> 1:09:31.900
<i>You know, we didn't spend
a lot of time together.</i>

1:09:31.902 --> 1:09:34.135
<i>But when we did, he
always take me to the water.</i>

1:09:34.137 --> 1:09:36.638
<i>That's more of a place
of connection I have with him</i>

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:38.773
<i>than anywhere else.</i>

1:09:38.775 --> 1:09:41.209
<i>I'm doing it because I think
it will be good at the end.</i>

1:09:41.211 --> 1:09:44.179
<i>It's just not gonna be
an easy thing for me.</i>

1:09:44.513 --> 1:09:46.214
I miss being out here.

1:09:52.154 --> 1:09:55.056
I remember when my dad used
to come to Thanksgiving dinner

1:09:55.758 --> 1:09:57.525
and that's, like, one of
the times I love

1:09:57.527 --> 1:10:00.562
because my mom would cook.

1:10:00.564 --> 1:10:03.565
It was like a whole family setting
which I never had growing up.

1:10:03.567 --> 1:10:06.134
So, we sat at the table and
we ate together. That was dope.

1:10:06.136 --> 1:10:09.504
I really liked that.
I always wanted to do it.

1:10:09.506 --> 1:10:11.406
So, when he did it.

1:10:11.408 --> 1:10:14.542
You know, it was, it was cool.
I like that a lot.

1:10:14.544 --> 1:10:17.845
<i>I don't think I realized losing
my pops would mean for such</i>

1:10:17.847 --> 1:10:22.483
<i>a big hold on me because he
wasn't there for most of my life.</i>

1:10:22.485 --> 1:10:25.119
<i>I guess I expected that
to change at some point.</i>

1:10:25.121 --> 1:10:27.956
<i>But now it won't.
That's a huge loss for me.</i>

1:10:27.958 --> 1:10:30.491
<i>And it hits me harder
than I expected.</i>

1:10:34.964 --> 1:10:37.098
Yep, I wanna write it out
to my dad.

1:10:40.869 --> 1:10:42.103
Okay.

1:10:46.475 --> 1:10:48.943
<i>I didn't expect to miss him
like I have</i>

1:10:48.945 --> 1:10:51.980
<i>and I think that's what
I want to tell him the most,</i>

1:10:51.982 --> 1:10:53.815
<i>that I miss him
and I'm always gonna carry him</i>

1:10:53.817 --> 1:10:56.417
<i>with me, no matter what.</i>

1:10:56.419 --> 1:10:59.187
<i>I tell him bye for now,
you know?</i>

1:10:59.189 --> 1:11:01.990
<i>I believe I see him again
one day, but for now,</i>

1:11:01.992 --> 1:11:04.325
<i>that page has turned.</i>

1:11:04.327 --> 1:11:06.461
<i>And I haven't said my goodbyes
to him.</i>

1:11:06.463 --> 1:11:09.998
<i>Not even at the funeral and
I think it will be helpful for me</i>

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:11.866
<i>to have have that closure
to see him another time.</i>

1:11:11.868 --> 1:11:14.068
<i>Yeah, for us that's past.</i>

1:11:14.070 --> 1:11:16.037
<i>One day, I think
we'll have it again.</i>

1:11:16.639 --> 1:11:18.906
I finished writing the letter
for my daddy.

1:11:18.908 --> 1:11:22.243
So, you ready to spread it
to the world?

1:11:22.745 --> 1:11:24.212
All right.

1:11:27.116 --> 1:11:30.718
Hey, Dad, I miss you a lot.

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:32.320
I wish you was here.

1:11:33.922 --> 1:11:35.290
[Cheyenne] Come on, I got you.

1:11:35.292 --> 1:11:39.160
When you passed, I was upset
and heartbroken.

1:11:39.162 --> 1:11:43.464
I think about you all the time and
I'm happy I attended your funeral.

1:11:43.466 --> 1:11:45.833
You will forever be great.

1:11:45.835 --> 1:11:49.837
And you will forever be in
our hearts till we meet again.

1:11:49.839 --> 1:11:51.739
Love you, Pops.

1:11:51.741 --> 1:11:54.208
- I like that. This was nice.
- Thanks.

1:11:54.210 --> 1:11:56.077
That's for my daddy.

1:11:56.712 --> 1:11:58.780
I miss you, Daddy.

1:11:58.782 --> 1:11:59.914
<i>I do feel better right now.</i>

1:11:59.916 --> 1:12:03.584
<i>So I'll keep taking
these steps as best as I can.</i>

1:12:03.586 --> 1:12:06.120
<i>Hopefully, in the end, it helps
get me to where I need to be.</i>

1:12:06.122 --> 1:12:08.556
That was brave.
That was very brave.

1:12:08.558 --> 1:12:11.059
- Thanks.
- 'Cause it takes a lot.

1:12:11.061 --> 1:12:13.428
- So, I'm proud of you to that.
- Thanks.

1:12:13.430 --> 1:12:15.163
Okay? It's not something easy.

1:12:15.165 --> 1:12:17.832
Thanks for coming, man.
Thanks, man. I appreciate you.

1:12:17.834 --> 1:12:21.436
- Thank you, man.
- That's what family's for, James.

1:12:21.438 --> 1:12:24.305
- That's what family's for.
- You're a great cousin.

1:12:25.441 --> 1:12:27.275
I try.

1:12:34.717 --> 1:12:37.151
We're gonna get some good
results today.

1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:41.589
<i>I head in to an appointment
at a local clinic to see</i>

1:12:41.591 --> 1:12:45.293
<i>what my weight's at and hopefully
show Dr. Now, some good progress.</i>

1:12:46.729 --> 1:12:49.864
<i>You know, I took Dr Now's
warning last time very seriously.</i>

1:12:49.866 --> 1:12:52.200
<i>But, I'm kind of getting
to a breaking point,</i>

1:12:52.202 --> 1:12:54.202
<i>for my chances for the program.</i>

1:12:54.204 --> 1:12:57.171
<i>So, I use that motivation
to work the most I can</i>

1:12:57.173 --> 1:12:59.107
<i>these past months.</i>

1:13:00.442 --> 1:13:01.909
James, we're ready for you.

1:13:01.911 --> 1:13:02.944
Okay.

1:13:02.946 --> 1:13:04.879
- Need any help?
- No, I got it.

1:13:04.881 --> 1:13:07.482
<i>And I think I'm gonna have
my best chance yet</i>

1:13:07.484 --> 1:13:10.818
<i>to show Dr. Now what I wanted
to show from the beginning.</i>

1:13:10.820 --> 1:13:14.956
<i>Last appointment, I was down
to 585 and Dr. Now told me</i>

1:13:14.958 --> 1:13:17.658
<i>that I have to lose
at least 50 pounds.</i>

1:13:17.660 --> 1:13:19.560
<i>I needed to meet my goal.</i>

1:13:19.562 --> 1:13:22.563
<i>If I did that, I should be
under 535.</i>

1:13:22.565 --> 1:13:27.969
543, so that is literally
about 42 pounds down, okay?

1:13:28.904 --> 1:13:31.806
<i>I feel very good with that
number in progress.</i>

1:13:31.808 --> 1:13:36.711
<i>Seeing that amount of weight
loss come out, it's very satisfying.</i>

1:13:36.713 --> 1:13:40.748
<i>It's not a specific goal,
but it's in range.</i>

1:13:40.750 --> 1:13:43.017
<i>So, I feel really good
right now.</i>

1:13:44.887 --> 1:13:46.888
- Hi, James.
- How you doing, Dr. Now?

1:13:46.890 --> 1:13:49.190
<i>All right, I'm doing well.</i>

1:13:49.192 --> 1:13:51.526
<i>James, looks like
you're making some progress.</i>

1:13:51.528 --> 1:13:52.794
Yes, sir.

1:13:52.796 --> 1:13:55.797
<i>So, what changes you made
with your eating habit?</i>

1:13:55.799 --> 1:13:58.132
I started eating more healthy

1:13:58.134 --> 1:13:59.901
and vegetables in my diet.

1:13:59.903 --> 1:14:04.071
I don't go over the max of the
1200 calorie diet you gave me.

1:14:04.073 --> 1:14:06.674
<i>Do you think that
psychotherapy was helping you?</i>

1:14:06.676 --> 1:14:08.543
Yes, sir. It did, it did.

1:14:08.545 --> 1:14:10.745
That's, that's the reason why I
was able to cut down some more.

1:14:10.747 --> 1:14:14.982
<i>Okay, so we wanna make
sure you continue with that.</i>

1:14:14.984 --> 1:14:17.418
<i>James, is that something
you wanted to continue</i>

1:14:17.420 --> 1:14:19.587
<i>and stick with the program?</i>

1:14:19.589 --> 1:14:23.458
Yes, Dr. Now. I made it
this far. I have to continue.

1:14:23.460 --> 1:14:25.660
The whole goal is for me
to get the surgery

1:14:25.662 --> 1:14:26.994
and I'm showing you
that I'm committed,

1:14:26.996 --> 1:14:30.031
so I'm... the program
is definitely a must.

1:14:30.033 --> 1:14:32.600
<i>All right, James, since
you make progress</i>

1:14:32.602 --> 1:14:35.603
<i>and you got close enough to
the goal I gave you this time,</i>

1:14:35.605 --> 1:14:37.905
we're gonna go ahead <i>and
set an appointment for you</i>

1:14:37.907 --> 1:14:40.808
<i>in two months
and in Houston, okay?</i>

1:14:40.810 --> 1:14:45.413
- Okay.
<i>- And I want you to lose another 35 pounds by then.</i>

1:14:45.415 --> 1:14:49.016
<i>And also, you need to move
down to Houston.</i>

1:14:49.018 --> 1:14:52.153
<i>If you do all those things,
then we're gonna move ahead</i>

1:14:52.155 --> 1:14:53.821
<i>with your weight loss surgery.</i>

1:14:53.823 --> 1:14:54.989
Thank you, Dr. Now.

1:14:54.991 --> 1:14:56.858
<i>Is that something
you want to do?</i>

1:14:56.860 --> 1:14:59.861
Yes, Dr. Now, I definitely
want to get the surgery.

1:14:59.863 --> 1:15:02.697
<i>Okay, so, I'll give you
two months,</i>

1:15:02.699 --> 1:15:05.466
<i>we're gonna work on all that
and keep up the good work.</i>

1:15:05.468 --> 1:15:07.235
<i>All right, James,
I'm proud of you.</i>

1:15:07.237 --> 1:15:09.737
<i>That first time I've seen
you making good progress,</i>

1:15:09.739 --> 1:15:10.938
<i>so, keep it up.</i>

1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:13.641
<i>And, at the meantime,
if you need anything,</i>

1:15:13.643 --> 1:15:16.811
<i>you may call and hopefully I'll
see you in two months in Houston.</i>

1:15:16.813 --> 1:15:18.112
No problem, Dr. Now,
see you then.

1:15:18.114 --> 1:15:20.448
<i>- Bye now.
- Bye, Dr. Now.</i>

1:15:20.450 --> 1:15:23.251
- She said bye.
- Bye, Dr. Now.

1:15:24.186 --> 1:15:26.053
Let's go.

1:15:26.421 --> 1:15:28.856
You need help? You good?

1:15:28.858 --> 1:15:32.326
<i>I've been ready to move
forward and I'm more dedicated</i>

1:15:32.328 --> 1:15:35.763
<i>than ever to do what it takes
to make sure of that.</i>

1:15:35.765 --> 1:15:37.698
<i>The best outcome for me
will be to hear</i>

1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:40.535
<i>that I'm approved
for weight loss surgery.</i>

1:15:40.537 --> 1:15:43.638
But I've known that <i>was
how everything is going down,</i>

1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:47.909
<i>that I was gonna have to do a
lot to prove myself to Dr. Now.</i>

1:15:47.911 --> 1:15:50.645
<i>But, I took the step in
being able to do that today.</i>

1:15:50.647 --> 1:15:52.813
<i>And that feels good.</i>

1:15:52.815 --> 1:15:53.881
<i>Having another goal
is not ideal,</i>

1:15:53.883 --> 1:15:56.918
<i>but I understand it
and I'm ready for it.</i>

1:15:56.920 --> 1:15:59.587
<i>And I'm at least excited
that I'm moving forward</i>

1:15:59.589 --> 1:16:01.923
<i>instead of hitting a wall again.</i>

1:16:01.925 --> 1:16:05.092
<i>So, I want to keep doing
all I can to make sure</i>

1:16:05.094 --> 1:16:08.329
<i>I stay in my stride
to get my second goal.</i>

1:16:13.101 --> 1:16:15.136
[horn toots]

1:16:21.076 --> 1:16:23.711
- Mmm.
- You tired, James?

1:16:23.713 --> 1:16:25.947
I'm all right.

1:16:26.882 --> 1:16:30.851
<i>I'm back in Houston finally, to
see Dr. Now in person again.</i>

1:16:30.853 --> 1:16:33.988
<i>To show him I'm still making
the progress I need.</i>

1:16:34.590 --> 1:16:35.923
<i>I've worked hard to do that.</i>

1:16:35.925 --> 1:16:38.626
<i>And I feel confident I'm going
to have positive results</i>

1:16:38.628 --> 1:16:42.763
<i>when I get on the scale
because I kept the hard work up.</i>

1:16:42.765 --> 1:16:45.166
<i>I even done more
with Dr. Paradise</i>

1:16:45.168 --> 1:16:47.068
<i>to have another session
with him.</i>

1:16:47.070 --> 1:16:49.270
<i>And I've been working on
getting out more</i>

1:16:49.272 --> 1:16:50.538
<i>and being in public more.</i>

1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:54.375
<i>So, it feels like I'm moving
in all the directions I need.</i>

1:16:54.377 --> 1:16:57.878
<i>The only thing is I haven't been
able to move to Houston yet.</i>

1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:02.316
I'm working on that <i>and
should be ready to do that soon.</i>

1:17:02.318 --> 1:17:05.086
<i>But I came down here
and I wanted to show Dr. Now</i>

1:17:05.088 --> 1:17:09.190
<i>I'm committed enough to do
this to get weight loss surgery.</i>

1:17:13.061 --> 1:17:14.261
I'll sit next to you.

1:17:19.067 --> 1:17:20.301
James.

1:17:21.069 --> 1:17:23.037
Let's go.

1:17:26.141 --> 1:17:28.576
<i>At my last appointment,
I was 543.</i>

1:17:28.578 --> 1:17:32.480
<i>And Dr. Now gave me the goal
of losing another 35 pounds today.</i>

1:17:32.482 --> 1:17:34.615
<i>So, that should put me
at 508 today.</i>

1:17:34.617 --> 1:17:36.350
Can you step on the scale?

1:17:51.967 --> 1:17:56.270
[clapping] Good job, James.
Good job.

1:17:56.772 --> 1:17:58.472
Thank you, thank you.

1:17:58.474 --> 1:18:00.007
- Go to room five now.
- Thank you.

1:18:00.009 --> 1:18:01.442
Let's go.

1:18:02.978 --> 1:18:04.412
<i>I knew I would make it today.</i>

1:18:05.914 --> 1:18:07.715
<i>So, I'm excited to hear
his response</i>

1:18:07.717 --> 1:18:10.017
<i>to my continued progress.</i>

1:18:12.621 --> 1:18:15.289
<i>And I'm excited to hear
what he thinks about</i>

1:18:15.291 --> 1:18:17.224
<i>my readiness to get
weight loss surgery.</i>

1:18:27.969 --> 1:18:30.271
[knocking at door]

1:18:31.773 --> 1:18:34.275
- Hello, how are y'all doing?
- Hi, Dr. Now.

1:18:35.177 --> 1:18:37.478
All right, y'all doing okay?

1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:39.847
- Yes, we are.
- Good.

1:18:39.849 --> 1:18:42.717
Well, James, it looks like
you're doing great,

1:18:42.719 --> 1:18:45.953
you lost 37 pounds,
so you got some momentum

1:18:45.955 --> 1:18:48.055
- going on.
- Yes, sir.

1:18:48.057 --> 1:18:49.924
So in total, you lost 119 pounds

1:18:49.926 --> 1:18:51.959
which is a good start,

1:18:51.961 --> 1:18:53.794
but it's good that you're
picking up the pace now.

1:18:53.796 --> 1:18:56.864
Yes, sir. I'm picking up the pace
and I'm starting to see a difference

1:18:56.866 --> 1:19:00.067
and other people are too, you
know, my family everywhere,

1:19:00.069 --> 1:19:02.169
my support system say
I'm doing a great job.

1:19:02.171 --> 1:19:02.970
So, that's been encouraging.

1:19:02.972 --> 1:19:04.438
Good.

1:19:04.440 --> 1:19:07.875
So, how does it feel
almost being in the 400s?

1:19:07.877 --> 1:19:09.310
I feel much better.

1:19:09.678 --> 1:19:11.178
I'm able to do more.

1:19:11.180 --> 1:19:13.347
- So, you figured out what to do...
- Yeah, yeah,

1:19:13.349 --> 1:19:14.815
definitely.

1:19:14.817 --> 1:19:18.052
The exercises, everything you
told me to do. I've been doing it.

1:19:18.054 --> 1:19:20.921
Um, going outside
like you said I should,

1:19:20.923 --> 1:19:22.089
taking the stairs.

1:19:22.091 --> 1:19:25.025
Um, I pulled my eating back
even more.

1:19:25.027 --> 1:19:26.727
That's great.
How about therapy?

1:19:26.729 --> 1:19:28.129
How was that helping any?

1:19:28.131 --> 1:19:32.933
A lot, he was able to help me
conquer that fear

1:19:32.935 --> 1:19:34.835
for me to go outside and...

1:19:34.837 --> 1:19:37.772
You know, so I did it. I'm doing
it and I'm gonna continue to do it.

1:19:37.774 --> 1:19:41.308
Good, that seemed like
a good progress you're making.

1:19:41.310 --> 1:19:45.012
- Yes, sir.
- James, I'm going to approve you for weight loss surgery

1:19:45.014 --> 1:19:47.782
since you're working hard
and making good progress now.

1:19:47.784 --> 1:19:49.550
- Yes.
- Wonderful news.

1:19:49.552 --> 1:19:50.951
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Now.

1:19:50.953 --> 1:19:54.722
I'm excited, I'm excited,
but the problem is, Dr. Now,

1:19:54.724 --> 1:19:56.824
I'm not fully moved
to Houston yet.

1:19:56.826 --> 1:19:58.859
Why don't you move
to Houston yet?

1:19:58.861 --> 1:20:01.061
Because I'm still tying
things down in New York.

1:20:01.063 --> 1:20:04.331
I got a couple of things that
I got to take care and line up.

1:20:04.333 --> 1:20:06.801
You know, like, my place and
everything that's in New York.

1:20:06.803 --> 1:20:09.970
And, you know, I still got my
mother and everybody in New York,

1:20:09.972 --> 1:20:11.539
I gotta get that situated.

1:20:11.541 --> 1:20:14.742
And once I get that done,
then I'm straight here.

1:20:14.744 --> 1:20:18.145
All right, well, you got
a lot of issues in New York

1:20:18.147 --> 1:20:19.279
that you need to take care of,

1:20:19.281 --> 1:20:21.982
but don't take too long
because if you take too long,

1:20:21.984 --> 1:20:23.350
you may go back
to old eating habits

1:20:23.352 --> 1:20:24.785
and you gain your weight back

1:20:24.787 --> 1:20:27.922
because the longer you wait in
your old environment right there,

1:20:27.924 --> 1:20:31.058
the more chance there is
of you falling back

1:20:31.060 --> 1:20:35.029
into old habit and so, try
to move as soon as you can.

1:20:35.031 --> 1:20:36.730
- Okay?
- I got it. I got it, Doc.

1:20:36.732 --> 1:20:38.899
I'm a do it real soon.

1:20:38.901 --> 1:20:41.702
And I want to get this done and I
want to be a part of your program,

1:20:41.704 --> 1:20:43.971
so that's definitely
on my agenda.

1:20:43.973 --> 1:20:46.440
Okay, good.
So I'm going to set you up

1:20:46.442 --> 1:20:48.008
for an appointment
for two months.

1:20:48.010 --> 1:20:50.010
If you're able to move down
here by then,

1:20:50.012 --> 1:20:51.645
then we'll do that here.

1:20:51.647 --> 1:20:55.916
But if not, then we'll set
your appointment in New York

1:20:55.918 --> 1:20:59.119
at a local clinic to check out and
make sure you're staying on track, okay?

1:20:59.121 --> 1:21:00.621
No problem, Doc.

1:21:00.623 --> 1:21:03.224
All right, James, I'm proud
of your progress, keep it up,

1:21:03.226 --> 1:21:05.693
and, hopefully, we'll see
you down in Houston

1:21:05.695 --> 1:21:07.661
and ready for your
weight loss surgery.

1:21:07.663 --> 1:21:10.064
That's what I'm waiting for,
I'm trying to get it off.

1:21:10.066 --> 1:21:12.766
It's time I get it off, Doctor,
I wanna live that new life.

1:21:12.768 --> 1:21:15.202
Well, good. So, I want you
to keep it up

1:21:15.204 --> 1:21:17.371
and have a good trip back home.

1:21:17.373 --> 1:21:20.007
And if you need anything
before then, give me a call.

1:21:20.009 --> 1:21:22.076
- No problem, Doctor. Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Doctor.

1:21:22.078 --> 1:21:23.143
- All right.
- Y'all take care.

1:21:23.145 --> 1:21:24.345
You too now.

1:21:30.619 --> 1:21:33.454
<i>[Dr. Now] I'm very glad to see
James is working through</i>

1:21:33.456 --> 1:21:36.457
what he needs to start making
the progress he should.

1:21:36.459 --> 1:21:38.893
<i>It took him a while, but
at least, he stuck with it,</i>

1:21:38.895 --> 1:21:40.661
<i>and I'm proud of him for that.</i>

1:21:40.663 --> 1:21:44.698
<i>It seems like the therapy has
been helping him a great deal.</i>

1:21:44.700 --> 1:21:48.469
<i>So, it will be important
he keeps doing that to work on</i>

1:21:48.471 --> 1:21:52.506
his emotional issues
and healthy coping mechanisms.

1:21:52.508 --> 1:21:55.042
<i>Because these are just
different steps he needs</i>

1:21:55.044 --> 1:21:57.912
<i>to take to get to a good place
with those things.</i>

1:21:57.914 --> 1:21:59.747
<i>And if he doesn't stick with it,</i>

1:21:59.749 --> 1:22:02.449
<i>his progress will only
be short lived.</i>

1:22:02.451 --> 1:22:05.019
<i>But, at this point,
I am confident and James</i>

1:22:05.021 --> 1:22:07.554
<i>is ready for weight
loss surgery.</i>

1:22:07.556 --> 1:22:09.990
<i>And once we take that
step with him,</i>

1:22:09.992 --> 1:22:14.461
<i>James will have all the tools he
needs to get to his target weight.</i>

1:22:14.463 --> 1:22:17.598
<i>So, James still has
a ways to go.</i>

1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:21.035
<i>But, I'm feeling optimistic
that we should see</i>

1:22:21.037 --> 1:22:23.470
a lot more positive change
and good progress

1:22:23.472 --> 1:22:26.173
from James here very soon.

1:22:27.742 --> 1:22:30.678
<i>I feel good because I
accomplished what I came here to do.</i>

1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:34.214
<i>You know, I proved myself
to Dr. Now</i>

1:22:34.216 --> 1:22:36.450
<i>and he knows I mean
what I say now.</i>

1:22:36.452 --> 1:22:38.619
<i>So, that feels good.</i>

1:22:38.621 --> 1:22:41.155
<i>And it feels good to
officially have my approval.</i>

1:22:41.157 --> 1:22:43.390
<i>So, now my focus is
to doing all I need</i>

1:22:43.392 --> 1:22:46.994
<i>to stay on track and work
to move down here to Houston.</i>

1:22:48.063 --> 1:22:50.464
<i>So, I'm going to go back
to New York and figure out</i>

1:22:50.466 --> 1:22:51.899
<i>my timeline for that.</i>

1:22:51.901 --> 1:22:54.401
<i>So, I could keep moving
forward to be where I want.</i>

1:23:07.482 --> 1:23:09.450
- [clears throat]
- Outside,

1:23:09.452 --> 1:23:13.187
we're getting a little bit of
exercise, James. You got this.

1:23:13.189 --> 1:23:15.856
<i>Me and Cheyenne are going
to play some basketball</i>

1:23:15.858 --> 1:23:18.092
<i>for my exercise today.</i>

1:23:19.494 --> 1:23:21.395
<i>So, I could get out some.</i>

1:23:22.797 --> 1:23:24.465
<i>I've been trying to make
an effort to do that</i>

1:23:24.467 --> 1:23:25.866
<i>as much as I can.</i>

1:23:25.868 --> 1:23:29.937
<i>As part of the stuff I've been
working with Dr. Paradise.</i>

1:23:30.905 --> 1:23:32.740
<i>He's been pushing me to go out
in public more</i>

1:23:32.742 --> 1:23:35.275
<i>and not shy away from that.</i>

1:23:37.479 --> 1:23:42.116
<i>To help me get past some of
my anxiety of being around people.</i>

1:23:48.823 --> 1:23:50.457
[grunts]

1:23:53.661 --> 1:23:57.464
<i>I'm still not 100% comfortable
being in public.</i>

1:24:03.438 --> 1:24:06.940
<i>But I will say, going out
like this just feels like</i>

1:24:06.942 --> 1:24:10.444
<i>it's helping me to be more
comfortable with the idea of being out.</i>

1:24:21.222 --> 1:24:22.823
Let's see, we got it.

1:24:22.825 --> 1:24:24.491
Oh... [clapping]

1:24:24.493 --> 1:24:27.127
<i>You know, it's still not
my first choice.</i>

1:24:30.031 --> 1:24:32.566
<i>But, I'm starting to learn,
at least, how to enjoy it</i>

1:24:32.568 --> 1:24:34.101
<i>a little more.</i>

1:24:37.138 --> 1:24:40.107
<i>And not worry about
other people as much,</i>

1:24:40.775 --> 1:24:42.376
<i>but it's still a process.</i>

1:24:43.144 --> 1:24:45.145
<i>Work in progress for me.</i>

1:24:48.183 --> 1:24:49.416
[pants]

1:24:52.687 --> 1:24:54.321
[Cheyenne] You okay?

1:24:56.758 --> 1:24:58.926
How you feeling right now,
you know, being outside,

1:24:58.928 --> 1:25:01.228
being a little active more?

1:25:02.464 --> 1:25:04.398
- Hmm?
- I'm good, I'm all right.

1:25:06.034 --> 1:25:07.768
[chuckles]

1:25:07.770 --> 1:25:09.970
Ready? You did good though.

1:25:09.972 --> 1:25:11.939
- You proud of me?
- Yeah.

1:25:11.941 --> 1:25:14.108
Stand up, stand up...

1:25:14.110 --> 1:25:15.442
Stand up.

1:25:15.710 --> 1:25:17.444
Stand over there.

1:25:19.781 --> 1:25:22.850
- This how you wanna do it?
- I'm a shoot it from right here.

1:25:22.852 --> 1:25:25.419
You think so? You know you're
gonna get smoked next, buddy.

1:25:26.454 --> 1:25:29.256
And I'm gonna beat you, eh?
[chuckles]
