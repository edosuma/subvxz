WEBVTT

00:02.462 --> 00:04.718
TONIGHT ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES...</i>

00:04.718 --> 00:07.682
WHAT IN THE
IS GOING ON?

00:07.682 --> 00:10.019
CHEF RAMSAY TRAVELS
TO EASTON, PENNSYLVANIA,

00:10.019 --> 00:12.190
TO TRY AND TURN AROUND
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT

00:12.190 --> 00:14.737
THAT IS ON THE VERGE
OF SHUTTING ITS DOORS.

00:14.737 --> 00:17.033
I'M AMAZED YOU'VE STAYED OPEN
FOR THREE  YEARS.

00:17.033 --> 00:19.496
THE OWNER ROSARIA
IS CLUELESS...

00:19.496 --> 00:21.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHY WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE

00:21.000 --> 00:22.210
COMING THROUGH THE DOOR.

00:22.210 --> 00:23.505
AS SHE HAS NO IDEA

00:23.505 --> 00:24.841
WHY HER RESTAURANT
IS FAILING.

00:24.841 --> 00:26.177
YOU CAN'T BE THIS NAIVE.

00:26.177 --> 00:27.972
AM I A SUPERWOMAN?

00:27.972 --> 00:29.559
SHE MAY HAVE BOUGHT
THIS RESTAURANT

00:29.559 --> 00:30.000
FOR HERSELF
AND HER TWO SONS...

00:30.000 --> 00:30.978
FOR HERSELF
AND HER TWO SONS...

00:30.978 --> 00:34.151
WHICH TABLE DID SHE SAY I NEED--
WAIT, WAIT.

00:34.151 --> 00:35.153
BUT THEIR LACK OF EXPERIENCE

00:35.153 --> 00:37.407
HAS THE RESTAURANT
IN A FREEFALL.

00:38.535 --> 00:39.829
THE FOOD IS HIDEOUS...

00:39.829 --> 00:41.165
<i>THAT'S LIKE BABY VOMIT.</i>

00:41.165 --> 00:43.127
AND THE STANDARDS
ARE REPULSIVE.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.964
OH, YOU DIRTY BASTARDS.

00:44.964 --> 00:46.217
CHEF RAMSAY IS IN

00:46.217 --> 00:48.054
FOR AN EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT CHALLENGE...

00:48.054 --> 00:49.724
YOU HAVE BIG ISSUES HERE.

00:49.724 --> 00:51.561
AS HE IS FORCED TO DEAL
WITH AN OWNER

00:51.561 --> 00:53.607
WHO SEEMS MORE CONTENT
WITH SHIFTING THE BLAME...

00:53.607 --> 00:55.569
I'M NOT THE CHEF, GORDON.

00:55.569 --> 00:56.613
THAN FIXING HER RESTAURANT.

00:56.613 --> 00:57.990
YOU'RE YELLING AT ME.

00:57.990 --> 01:00.000
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT YOU SHOULD
TAKE UP WITH THE CHEF.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.119
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT YOU SHOULD
TAKE UP WITH THE CHEF.

01:00.119 --> 01:02.249
OH, MY GOD.

01:02.249 --> 01:03.585
AS FOR THE STAFF,

01:03.585 --> 01:05.046
THEY'RE COMPLETELY FED UP.

01:05.046 --> 01:06.800
YOU TOLD ME NO SPECIALS.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.179
THEN SHE GOES OUT
AND  SAYS "SPECIAL."

01:09.179 --> 01:10.431
AND THEY AREN'T THE ONLY ONES.

01:10.431 --> 01:14.106
I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER COME
BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT.

01:14.106 --> 01:16.110
CHEF RAMSAY TRIES HIS BEST

01:16.110 --> 01:18.489
TO SAVE A RESTAURANT
THAT MIGHT JUST BE IMPOSSIBLE...

01:18.489 --> 01:20.995
YOU'RE BOTH DESTROYING
EACH OTHER.

01:20.995 --> 01:22.163
TO SAVE.

01:22.163 --> 01:24.126
THE NEXT PERSON THAT THROWS
THAT OUT AT ME,

01:24.126 --> 01:26.463
I WILL THROW THEM OUT.

01:28.969 --> 01:29.971
<i>WHAT IS THAT?</i>

01:29.971 --> 01:30.000
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.933
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

01:31.933 --> 01:33.102
THEY'RE NOT CRAP.
THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

01:33.102 --> 01:34.772
THEN WAKE UP!
<i>YOU</i> WAKE UP.

01:34.772 --> 01:36.610
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

01:36.610 --> 01:37.737
GET OUT OF HERE!

01:37.737 --> 01:39.323
<i>THAT IS AMAZING.</i>

01:39.323 --> 01:40.325
THAT'S EMBARRASSING!

01:40.325 --> 01:41.870
OH, GOD!

01:41.870 --> 01:45.209
<i>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</i>

01:47.297 --> 01:48.675
EASTON, PENNSYLVANIA,

01:48.675 --> 01:51.514
IS LOCATED AN HOUR AWAY
FROM PHILADELPHIA.

01:51.514 --> 01:53.977
JUST OUTSIDE OF DOWNTOWN EASTON
IS BELLA LUNA,

01:53.977 --> 01:57.025
AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT OWNED
BY ROSARIA SCOLLO...

01:57.025 --> 01:58.152
THIS TABLE RIGHT HERE.
THANK YOU.

01:58.152 --> 02:00.000
WHO BOUGHT THE RESTAURANT
IN 2010

02:00.000 --> 02:00.574
WHO BOUGHT THE RESTAURANT
IN 2010

02:00.574 --> 02:03.664
FOR HER TWO SONS
MAURIZIO AND GIANFRANCO.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.672
THAT'S FOR NICOLE.

02:07.672 --> 02:09.801
MY SON GIANFRANCO
WENT TO CULINARY SCHOOL,

02:09.801 --> 02:12.515
AND ONE OF HIS DREAMS
WAS TO OWN HIS OWN RESTAURANT.

02:12.515 --> 02:14.393
TWO CHICKEN PARMS,
PENNE VODKA,

02:14.393 --> 02:15.980
AND CHICKEN AND BROCCOLI.

02:15.980 --> 02:20.154
SO WE FOUND A PLACE HERE,
AND WE TOOK A CHANCE.

02:20.154 --> 02:23.494
EVERYTHING OKAY?

02:25.582 --> 02:28.004
I FEEL THE COMMUNITY HAS NOT
RESPONDED TO US

02:28.004 --> 02:29.172
THE WAY WE THOUGHT.

02:29.172 --> 02:30.000
I DON'T FEEL
THEY REALLY APPRECIATE

02:30.000 --> 02:31.010
I DON'T FEEL
THEY REALLY APPRECIATE

02:31.010 --> 02:33.389
FINE ITALIAN COOKING.

02:33.389 --> 02:37.022
I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS WORTH
COMING BACK TO EVER.

02:37.022 --> 02:39.234
WE'RE IN A STATE THAT WE DON'T
HAVE MUCH BUSINESS AT ALL.

02:39.234 --> 02:40.654
YOU KNOW, THERE'S DAYS
WE GOTTA CLOSE EARLY.

02:40.654 --> 02:42.032
THERE'S DAYS WE DON'T OPEN
FOR LUNCH.

02:42.032 --> 02:45.413
IF THIS GUY COMPLAINS STILL,
LET ME KNOW.

02:45.413 --> 02:49.129
PEOPLE OF EASTON
LIKE MEDIOCRE ITALIAN FOOD,

02:49.129 --> 02:51.968
FROZEN FOOD,
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO.

02:51.968 --> 02:53.722
FYI, THEY SENT
THE SOUP BACK.

02:53.722 --> 02:55.517
THEY SAID IT TASTED FATTY.

02:55.517 --> 02:56.811
JUST FYI.
IT TASTED FATTY.

02:56.811 --> 02:59.316
I STUDIED IN ITALY,
AND I WORKED WITH CHEFS,

02:59.316 --> 03:00.000
AND I KNOW
WHAT ITALIAN FOOD IS.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.861
AND I KNOW
WHAT ITALIAN FOOD IS.

03:00.861 --> 03:02.531
THIS CHICKEN'S BURNT.

03:02.531 --> 03:04.409
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THIS CHICKEN IS BURNT?

03:04.409 --> 03:05.746
DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
BURNT CHICKEN?

03:05.746 --> 03:08.042
<i>PLEASE.</i>
IT DOESN'T TASTE BAD TO ME.

03:08.042 --> 03:10.547
WHAT ARE WE DOING WRONG?

03:10.547 --> 03:11.966
THAT'S MY QUESTION
TO MYSELF.

03:11.966 --> 03:14.137
"WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?"

03:19.189 --> 03:21.401
BELLA LUNA, PERSONALLY,

03:21.401 --> 03:23.532
I THINK IT LOOKS
LIKE A MORGUE.

03:23.532 --> 03:26.036
WHEN YOU WALK
INTO THIS PLACE,

03:26.036 --> 03:28.040
I THINK,
"WHERE'S THE VIEWING?"

03:28.040 --> 03:29.877
DO I GO THROUGH THAT DOOR?

03:29.877 --> 03:30.000
IS THAT
WHERE THE BODY'S LAID OUT?

03:30.000 --> 03:34.010
IS THAT
WHERE THE BODY'S LAID OUT?

03:34.010 --> 03:35.054
WHY DID THEY WANT
TO SPEAK TO ME?

03:35.054 --> 03:36.390
WHY CAN'T YOU DEAL WITH IT?

03:36.390 --> 03:38.310
I-I COULD--
I TRIED TO DEAL WITH IT,

03:38.310 --> 03:39.981
BUT THEY ASKED
TO GO OVER MY HEAD.
WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK TO THEM?

03:39.981 --> 03:41.441
I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH EVERYBODY
ALL NIGHT.

03:41.441 --> 03:43.195
ROSARIA IS
VERY DISORGANIZED...

03:43.195 --> 03:45.074
WHY ARE YOU IN THE KITCHEN, MA?

03:45.074 --> 03:46.118
YOU SHOULD BE OUT
ON THE FLOOR.

03:46.118 --> 03:48.080
BECAUSE I'M TRYING
TO HELP OUT.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.126
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
YOU GOTTA HELP OUT ON THE FLOOR.

03:50.126 --> 03:51.211
AND SHE'S NOT A LEADER.

03:51.211 --> 03:53.842
EVERYBODY IS RUNNING AROUND,

03:53.842 --> 03:56.848
BURNING THE CANDLE
AT BOTH ENDS.

03:59.812 --> 04:00.000
BELLA LUNA SHOULD BE ON THE MAP,

04:00.000 --> 04:01.858
BELLA LUNA SHOULD BE ON THE MAP,

04:01.858 --> 04:03.612
AND IT'S JUST NOT.

04:03.612 --> 04:07.536
AND WE NEED
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

04:07.536 --> 04:10.082
IF WE HAVE TO CLOSE,
I WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED

04:10.082 --> 04:11.669
BECAUSE WE WORKED
SO HARD

04:11.669 --> 04:13.715
TO MAKE THIS DREAM HAPPEN,

04:13.715 --> 04:16.971
AND IT WOULD JUST
KINDA KILL ME.

04:16.971 --> 04:20.144
IT REALLY WOULD.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.365
<i>BELLA LUNA.</i>

04:35.049 --> 04:37.053
HELLO.
WELCOME, CHEF RAMSAY.

04:37.053 --> 04:38.097
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M TRACI.

04:38.097 --> 04:40.184
TRACI--OH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:40.184 --> 04:41.436
NICE TO SEE YOU.
IS THIS YOUR PLACE?

04:41.436 --> 04:43.148
NO, I AM THE MANAGER HERE.

04:43.148 --> 04:46.113
ROSARIA SCOLLO OWNS IT
AND HER TWO SONS,

04:46.113 --> 04:47.908
GIAFFY, OUR HEAD CHEF...
OKAY, GREAT.

04:47.908 --> 04:49.996
MAURIZIO, THE SON.
SO MOTHER AND SON...

04:49.996 --> 04:51.206
MOTHER AND TWO SONS.
RUN THE PLACE.

04:51.206 --> 04:52.960
DO YOU NORMALLY
GREET CUSTOMERS

04:52.960 --> 04:54.129
BEFORE THEY EVEN GET OUT
OF THE CAR?

04:54.129 --> 04:55.298
NO, YOU'RE SPECIAL.
SERIOUS?

04:55.298 --> 04:56.718
I'M SPECIAL.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SPECIAL.

04:56.718 --> 04:58.053
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
AND YOU SMELL GOOD.

04:59.389 --> 05:00.000
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN,
HOW BAD ARE THEY?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.143
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN,
HOW BAD ARE THEY?

05:01.143 --> 05:03.815
- 2.
- OH,.

05:03.815 --> 05:05.652
THEY'RE VERY STUBBORN.

05:05.652 --> 05:07.196
ROSARIA CODDLES GIAFFY.

05:07.196 --> 05:09.159
YOU KNOW, IF A CUSTOMER
SENDS A PLATE BACK,

05:09.159 --> 05:11.204
SHE'LL DEFEND THE SON
INSTEAD OF SAYING,

05:11.204 --> 05:12.708
"THE CUSTOMER'S ALWAYS RIGHT."
WOW.

05:12.708 --> 05:15.046
THAT MAKES ME INSANE.
ARE THE LOCALS BITING?

05:15.046 --> 05:17.175
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.
NO, NO ONE'S BITING?

05:17.175 --> 05:19.179
AND THIS PLACE
SHOULD BE BANGIN'.

05:19.179 --> 05:20.222
WE HAVE TO DO THINGS.

05:20.222 --> 05:21.893
I RUN
A <i>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</i> BINGO

05:21.893 --> 05:22.895
ON A THURSDAY NIGHT.

05:22.895 --> 05:24.064
SAY THAT AGAIN.

05:24.064 --> 05:26.193
<i>FIFTY SHADES OF GREY</i> BINGO.
BINGO?

05:26.193 --> 05:27.403
IT'S ADULT BINGO.
ADULT BINGO.

05:27.403 --> 05:29.658
ARE HANDCUFFS INVOLVED?
<i>NO, NO.</i>

05:29.658 --> 05:30.000
WELL, THEY COULD BE
IF YOU WANTED THEM.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.036
WELL, THEY COULD BE
IF YOU WANTED THEM.

05:31.036 --> 05:32.831
BUT I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOU--
NO, GOD, NO.

05:32.831 --> 05:35.002
JEEZ, MAN.
I JUST ARRIVED.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.966
WE JUST TRY
AND THINK OF ANYTHING

05:37.966 --> 05:39.512
THAT WILL CREATE
A BUZZ, A STIR.

05:39.512 --> 05:41.181
BUT--OKAY, YOUR HAIR
LOOKS GREAT, BY THE WAY.

05:41.181 --> 05:42.475
TURN AROUND.
IT LOOKS LOVELY.

05:42.475 --> 05:44.688
IT'S A CHIA PET, BUT--

05:44.688 --> 05:45.899
IT'S--
CAN WE GET INSIDE?

05:45.899 --> 05:47.736
PLEASE COME.
IT'S AN HONOR.

05:47.736 --> 05:49.364
AND THANK YOU FOR THE BRIEFING,
BY THE WAY.

05:49.364 --> 05:52.203
I APPRECIATE IT.
OH, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

05:52.203 --> 05:53.080
ALL RIGHT.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.875
IS IT CHRISTMAS?

05:54.875 --> 05:56.712
<i>YEAH.</i>

05:56.712 --> 05:58.340
<i>WHAT'S WITH ALL</i>
<i>THE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS?</i>

05:58.340 --> 05:59.342
UM...

05:59.342 --> 06:00.000
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE
OF JULY, RIGHT?

06:00.000 --> 06:00.469
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE
OF JULY, RIGHT?

06:00.469 --> 06:02.516
IT'S CHRISTMAS IN JULY.

06:02.516 --> 06:03.518
HI.

06:03.518 --> 06:04.645
OH, HELLO.

06:04.645 --> 06:06.398
HELLO, CHEF RAMSAY.
YOU MUST BE...

06:06.398 --> 06:07.734
I'M ROSARIA.
ROSARIA, NICE TO SEE YOU.

06:07.734 --> 06:08.820
CAN I GIVE YOU
A HUG AND A KISS?

06:08.820 --> 06:10.574
OH.
I'M ITALIAN.

06:10.574 --> 06:12.076
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

06:12.076 --> 06:14.080
NICE TO MEET YOU.
LET'S GO INSIDE, SHALL WE?

06:14.080 --> 06:16.544
IN THE BAR
AND HAVE A LITTLE CHAT.
SURE.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.338
EXCELLENT.

06:18.338 --> 06:20.677
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

06:20.677 --> 06:22.054
LET'S GO BACK
TO THE BEGINNING.

06:22.054 --> 06:23.850
HOW LONG YOU BEEN OPEN?
THREE YEARS.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.186
THREE YEARS.
OKAY, GOOD.

06:25.186 --> 06:27.064
AND WHAT KIND OF BACKGROUND
DO YOU HAVE?

06:27.064 --> 06:30.000
I DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE
OF OWNING MY OWN RESTAURANT.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.114
I DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE
OF OWNING MY OWN RESTAURANT.

06:31.114 --> 06:32.241
NEITHER DID MY SON,

06:32.241 --> 06:34.955
BUT WE ALL HAVE
THE PASSION FOR FOOD.
MM-HMM.

06:34.955 --> 06:37.084
AND SINCE GIANFRANCO
WENT TO SCHOOL

06:37.084 --> 06:38.505
AND HE WANTED
TO BECOME A CHEF,

06:38.505 --> 06:39.507
YOU KNOW,
THIS WAS OUR DREAM.

06:39.507 --> 06:42.011
SO HE HAS
RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE?

06:42.011 --> 06:44.098
UH, WELL,
WHEN HE FINISHED SCHOOL,

06:44.098 --> 06:46.604
HE DID AN INTERNSHIP
IN MANHATTAN...
YEAH.

06:46.604 --> 06:47.940
AND THEN AFTER THAT,

06:47.940 --> 06:49.735
WE JUST JUMPED IN HERE,
SO I WOULDN'T SAY--

06:49.735 --> 06:51.906
WHAT?
I WOULDN'T SAY HE HAD--

06:51.906 --> 06:54.202
INTERNSHIP TO OWNERSHIP?
YES.

06:54.202 --> 06:55.496
NO, COME ON.
SO WE ALL--YES.

06:55.496 --> 06:57.166
WHAT ABOUT THE BIG BIT
IN BETWEEN,

06:57.166 --> 06:59.087
THE THINGS CALLED EXPERIENCE?
DIDN'T HAVE ANY.

06:59.087 --> 07:00.000
BUT YOU HAD A VISION.

07:00.000 --> 07:00.172
BUT YOU HAD A VISION.

07:00.172 --> 07:02.218
WE HAD A VISION.
WE FOLLOWED IT.
WOW.

07:02.218 --> 07:03.387
SO HOW'S THE FOOD?

07:03.387 --> 07:06.017
I THINK
IT'S MORE AUTHENTIC THAN--

07:06.017 --> 07:07.854
THAN OTHER PLACES AROUND HERE.
OKAY, RIGHT.

07:07.854 --> 07:10.067
WE MAKE EVERYTHING FRESH.
WE DON'T USE ANYTHING FROZEN.

07:10.067 --> 07:12.405
THAT'S GREAT NEWS.
YOU KNOW, WE ONLY HAVE
ONE FREEZER.

07:12.405 --> 07:14.242
AND THIS IS THE WAY
I WANT IT TO BE.

07:14.242 --> 07:16.706
I WANT TO BRING OUT
FRESH ITALIAN FOOD.
SURE.

07:16.706 --> 07:18.166
BUT WHY WOULDN'T EASTON
EMBRACE THAT?

07:18.166 --> 07:19.085
WHY WOULDN'T THEY SUPPORT THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

07:19.085 --> 07:20.588
I THINK
THEY'RE USED TO ONE THING.

07:20.588 --> 07:22.425
LIKE, IF THEY'RE USED
TO FROZEN FOOD

07:22.425 --> 07:24.053
AND YOU GIVE THEM
FRESH AUTHENTIC,

07:24.053 --> 07:25.222
THEY WILL NOT
APPRECIATE IT.

07:25.222 --> 07:27.018
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THEY'D BE MORE UPSET

07:27.018 --> 07:29.397
WITH FRESH AS OPPOSED
TO FROZEN?
YEAH.

07:29.397 --> 07:30.000
THE FOOD IS NOT
THE PROBLEM HERE.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.069
THE FOOD IS NOT
THE PROBLEM HERE.

07:32.069 --> 07:34.115
IT'S PROBABLY MORE
OF THE COMMUNITY

07:34.115 --> 07:38.165
REALLY DON'T KNOW ABOUT
FRESH AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FOOD.

07:38.165 --> 07:39.167
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHEF.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.461
MAURIZIO.
MAURIZIO.

07:40.461 --> 07:41.463
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
MAURIZIO, AND THIS IS--

07:41.463 --> 07:44.052
AND THIS IS--THIS IS--
CHEF GIANFRANCO.

07:44.052 --> 07:45.179
HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

07:45.179 --> 07:46.473
GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUD.

07:46.473 --> 07:49.479
SO THIS IS A DREAM
COME TRUE FOR YOU, RIGHT?

07:49.479 --> 07:51.984
IT IS.
YOU RUNNING A BUSINESS
WITH YOUR MOM.

07:51.984 --> 07:52.986
YES.

07:52.986 --> 07:54.072
AND ARE THERE ANY ISSUES

07:54.072 --> 07:55.700
WITH YOU AND YOUR MOM
RUNNING THIS RESTAURANT?

07:55.700 --> 07:57.871
UH, YES.

07:57.871 --> 07:59.332
LIKE COMMUNICATION.

07:59.332 --> 08:00.000
ME AND MY MOM--
I MEAN, IT'S KINDA LIKE,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.211
ME AND MY MOM--
I MEAN, IT'S KINDA LIKE,

08:01.211 --> 08:03.883
YOU KNOW, HARD
'CAUSE IT'S YOUR MOTHER.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.595
AND, YOU KNOW,
WE ARE BOTH BOSSES TOGETHER,

08:05.595 --> 08:08.350
BUT SOMETIMES I DON'T AGREE,
AND I TELL HER,

08:08.350 --> 08:09.853
BUT SHE JUST DON'T LISTEN.

08:09.853 --> 08:10.980
NOW HOW WOULD YOU RATE
YOUR FOOD

08:10.980 --> 08:12.149
IN TERMS OF A SCALE
OF ONE TO TEN?

08:12.149 --> 08:13.318
WHERE WOULD YOU GO?
EIGHT.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.571
EIGHT?
FANTASTIC.

08:14.571 --> 08:16.032
WELL, LISTEN, I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU AFTER LUNCH.

08:16.032 --> 08:17.034
OKAY.
YEAH.

08:17.034 --> 08:18.245
THANK YOU, CHEF.
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

<i>YES, SIR.</i>

08:26.971 --> 08:28.683
GOD ALMIGHTY.

08:28.683 --> 08:30.000
OKAY, WHO'S BEEN WRITING LETTERS
TO OUR  CUSTOMERS?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.354
OKAY, WHO'S BEEN WRITING LETTERS
TO OUR  CUSTOMERS?

08:31.354 --> 08:33.358
<i>"THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING</i>
<i>BELLA LUNA."</i>

08:33.358 --> 08:35.864
OKAY, "WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE
IN PREPARING EVERY MEAL

08:35.864 --> 08:38.368
AND REFUSE TO SERVE
SUBSTANDARD FOOD."

08:38.368 --> 08:39.746
THAT'S AN IDEA.

08:39.746 --> 08:41.374
I LIKE THAT.
GOOD.

08:41.374 --> 08:43.003
SHOULD WE ORDER?
<i>OKAY.</i>

08:43.003 --> 08:44.715
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.414

PENNE ALLA VODKA.

<i>THAT'S IT.</i>

09:06.049 --> 09:08.220
OH,

OH, HELLO.

09:13.063 --> 09:14.065
I'M VERY GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

09:14.065 --> 09:15.067
VERY WELL.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

09:15.067 --> 09:16.069
NICOLE.
NICOLE.

09:16.069 --> 09:18.198
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?
A YEAR AND A HALF.

09:18.198 --> 09:20.202
IN YOUR MIND,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE PLACE?

09:20.202 --> 09:23.668
MANAGEMENT NOT FOCUSING ON,

09:23.668 --> 09:26.005
IN MY OPINION, WHAT THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

09:26.005 --> 09:27.968
SO TOTALLY UNFOCUSED.
YEAH.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.000
THERE'S A LOT
OF NAME-CALLING,

09:30.000 --> 09:30.849
THERE'S A LOT
OF NAME-CALLING,

09:30.849 --> 09:32.894
DISRESPECTFULNESS IN THE BACK.

09:32.894 --> 09:34.731
REALLY?
WHAT, FROM THE KITCHEN?

09:34.731 --> 09:36.527
YEAH.
MAN.

09:36.527 --> 09:38.698
YEAH.
WELL, ENJOY YOUR MEAL.

09:38.698 --> 09:40.535
THANK YOU.

09:42.664 --> 09:44.751
SHE SEEMS LIKE
A NICE GIRL.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.170
NO, NO.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:46.170 --> 09:48.133
OUT OF HER MIND.
SERIOUS?

09:48.133 --> 09:49.427
YES, CHEF.

09:49.427 --> 09:51.431
NICOLE IS A MORON.

09:51.431 --> 09:53.853
DID I SERVE YOU?

09:53.853 --> 09:55.982
NICOLE NEEDS TO BE
OUT OF HERE,

09:55.982 --> 09:59.155
BUT I LEAVE THAT UP
TO ROSARIA.

09:59.155 --> 10:00.000
AND THIS IS
THE SALTIMBOCCA.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.242
AND THIS IS
THE SALTIMBOCCA.

10:01.242 --> 10:03.246
YES, CHEF.
THANK YOU, DARLING.

10:03.246 --> 10:05.752
OKAY.

10:05.752 --> 10:07.046
WOW.

10:07.046 --> 10:10.260
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS EDIBLE.

10:13.517 --> 10:16.272
MY GOD,
IT'S BLAND, CHEWY,

10:16.272 --> 10:18.151
AND IT'S BEEN BEATEN
THE CRAP OUT OF.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.072
DISGUSTING.

10:22.493 --> 10:24.080
I THINK HE'S COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE VEAL, GIAF,

10:24.080 --> 10:25.165
THAT IT'S TOUGH.

10:25.165 --> 10:27.127
I DID IT TEN--
NOT EVEN TWO SECONDS.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.000
I FLIPPED IT REALLY QUICK.
TENDERIZE IT?

10:30.000 --> 10:30.133
I FLIPPED IT REALLY QUICK.
TENDERIZE IT?

10:30.133 --> 10:31.971
I MEAN, WE DO HAVE
ONE OF THE BEST VEALS.

10:31.971 --> 10:34.141
WE GET IT FROM THE BUTCHER
IN QUEENS,

10:34.141 --> 10:37.231
SO I DON'T KNOW,
UNLESS YOU OVERCOOKED IT.

10:37.231 --> 10:38.985
I DID NOT
OVERCOOK IT, MA.

10:38.985 --> 10:40.028
WELL...

10:40.028 --> 10:41.657
THIS IS SO OVERCOOKED.

10:41.657 --> 10:43.326
IT'S EXTRAORDINARY.

10:43.326 --> 10:44.663
HAVE A LITTLE TASTE
OF THAT.

10:44.663 --> 10:46.583
OH, MY GOOD GOD.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.754
I MEAN, IT'S DUSTED
WITH FLOUR.

10:48.754 --> 10:49.881
VERY, YES.

10:49.881 --> 10:51.552
SEE THIS HERE?
THAT--THAT'S GUNGE.

10:51.552 --> 10:54.015
THAT'S JUST RAW FLOUR
THAT IS LIKE--

10:54.015 --> 10:56.019
YOU COULD MAKE A
PIZZA DOUGH WITH THAT.

10:56.019 --> 10:58.566
THAT'S--
THAT'S GUNGE.

10:58.566 --> 10:59.568
I'LL REMOVE IT.
THANK YOU, CHEF.

10:59.568 --> 11:00.000
THANK YOU.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.237
THANK YOU.

11:01.237 --> 11:03.534
WOW.

11:03.534 --> 11:04.870
<i>HOW'S THE VEAL, TRAY?</i>

11:04.870 --> 11:06.540
<i>VEAL'S OVERCOOKED.</i>

11:06.540 --> 11:08.001
HE SAID--
GUNGE, HE CALLED IT.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.798
IT'S--IT'S JUST FLOUR.

11:10.798 --> 11:13.136
WOW.

11:13.136 --> 11:16.142
I MEAN,
THIS IS  CRAZY.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.689
IF CHEF RAMSAY
DOESN'T LIKE THE VEAL,

11:18.689 --> 11:20.150
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
ABOUT THAT

11:20.150 --> 11:21.862
BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S MADE,

11:21.862 --> 11:24.158
AND I'M NOT GONNA
CHANGE THAT.

11:24.158 --> 11:28.751
OKAY, CHEF,
THIS IS OUR PENNE ALLA VODKA.

11:28.751 --> 11:29.920
CAN I JUST GIVE YOU THAT?
IT'S ALL YELLOW,

11:29.920 --> 11:30.000
AND BITS OF CRAP.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.007
AND BITS OF CRAP.

11:32.007 --> 11:34.220
WHY IS IT DROWNED
IN SAUCE?

11:34.220 --> 11:38.061
I CANNOT ANSWER THAT.

11:39.146 --> 11:42.194
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE BABY VOMIT.

11:42.194 --> 11:43.154
THE SAUCE IS DISGUSTING,

11:43.154 --> 11:45.743
AND THAT IS GROSS.

11:45.743 --> 11:48.081
CAN THE CHEF
NOT COOK PASTA?

11:48.081 --> 11:51.964
WE HAVE INCONSISTENCIES.

11:51.964 --> 11:52.966
YOU SHOULD HAVE GRABBED
THE PENNE

11:52.966 --> 11:54.051
THAT I COOKED
THIS MORNING.

11:54.051 --> 11:55.555
WHY?

11:55.555 --> 11:58.059
THE PENNE THAT I JUST COOKED,
IT'S SITTING THERE FRESH.

11:58.059 --> 11:59.980
IT DIDN'T EVEN
GET OILED YET.

11:59.980 --> 12:00.000
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT DIDN'T GET OILED?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.650
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IT DIDN'T GET OILED?

12:01.650 --> 12:03.153
THE PENNE
I COOKED YESTERDAY.

12:03.153 --> 12:04.113
<i>I'M SURE</i>
<i>THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.</i>

12:04.113 --> 12:07.077
IT STILL TASTES GOOD.

12:07.077 --> 12:08.747
HE DIDN'T LIKE THE TASTE?

12:08.747 --> 12:10.167
NO, NO.
HE DIDN'T LIKE THE TASTE?

12:10.167 --> 12:12.212
AWFUL.
HE SAID IT WAS LIKE BABY VOMIT.

12:15.218 --> 12:17.389
BABY VOMIT.

12:17.389 --> 12:19.978
WOW.

12:19.978 --> 12:23.151
OKAY.

12:23.151 --> 12:25.405
ROSARIA, COME OVER.

12:25.405 --> 12:28.411
APART FROM BEING DROWNED
IN SAUCE,

12:28.411 --> 12:29.539
THE PASTA'S LIKE MUSH.

12:29.539 --> 12:30.000
WOULD YOU MIND?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
WOULD YOU MIND?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.879
'CAUSE EVERYONE STARTS THINKING
I'M EXAGGERATING,

12:32.879 --> 12:35.133
BUT IT'S, LIKE, OVERCOOKED.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.135
DISGUSTING.

12:36.135 --> 12:37.513
BUT THE FLAVOR
IS NOT BAD.

12:37.513 --> 12:38.641
OH, I DISAGREE.

12:38.641 --> 12:41.020
DISAGREE WITH THE FLAVOR?

12:41.020 --> 12:42.272
THE SAUCE IS BLAND,
THERE'S NO SALT IN THE SAUCE,

12:42.272 --> 12:43.525
AND THERE'S
TOO MUCH GARLIC.

12:43.525 --> 12:44.861
<i>BUT FOR ME,</i>
<i>THE FUNDAMENTALS,</i>

12:44.861 --> 12:46.155
<i>WHEN IT COMES</i>
<i>TO AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT,</i>

12:46.155 --> 12:47.700
IS THE PASTA.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.955
THE PASTA'S OVERCOOKED.
THAT'S THE EMBARRASSING PART.

12:49.955 --> 12:51.165
ANYWAY, CAN YOU GET THE CHEF
TO TASTE THAT?

12:51.165 --> 12:52.292
OKAY.
<i>EXCELLENT.</i>

12:52.292 --> 12:53.294
THANK YOU.

12:53.294 --> 12:55.841
WOW.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.052
TASTE THE PASTA.

12:57.052 --> 12:59.724
HE SAID IT'S DROWNED
IN SAUCE,

12:59.724 --> 13:00.000
AND IT DOESN'T
HAVE ANY FLAVOR.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.435
AND IT DOESN'T
HAVE ANY FLAVOR.

13:01.435 --> 13:02.939
THE SAUCE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY FLAVOR?

13:02.939 --> 13:04.191
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

13:07.030 --> 13:09.536
EIGHT OUT OF TEN?

13:09.536 --> 13:10.830
TRUST ME, RIGHT NOW,
HE'S NOT EVEN

13:10.830 --> 13:13.001
EIGHT OUT OF A HUNDRED.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.629
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU, CHEF.

13:14.629 --> 13:16.967
I HOPE.
GOOD LUCK.

13:18.971 --> 13:20.975
WOW.

13:20.975 --> 13:22.645
ARE WE SHORT?

13:22.645 --> 13:24.899
THAT'S IT.

13:24.899 --> 13:26.068
WHEN I THINK
OF ITALIAN CUISINE,

13:26.068 --> 13:28.072
IT'S DONE WITH AN EXCITING,
GENEROUS AMOUNT

13:28.072 --> 13:29.366
OF MUSSELS IN A BOWL.

13:29.366 --> 13:30.000
BUT THAT HAS TO BE
THE TIGHTEST PORTION OF MUSSELS

13:30.000 --> 13:31.997
BUT THAT HAS TO BE
THE TIGHTEST PORTION OF MUSSELS

13:31.997 --> 13:33.499
I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

13:33.499 --> 13:34.836
IS THAT WHAT
CUSTOMERS GET?

13:34.836 --> 13:36.673
THIS IS WHAT
CUSTOMERS GET, CHEF.

13:36.673 --> 13:37.925
BUT HOW MUCH IS THAT?

13:37.925 --> 13:39.094
I'M NOT REALLY SURE,
CHEF.

13:39.094 --> 13:40.180
CAN YOU FIND OUT
HOW MUCH THIS ONE IS?

13:40.180 --> 13:41.933
YES, CHEF, I WILL.
<i>PLEASE?</i>

13:41.933 --> 13:46.400
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.237
OH, MY GOD,
HOW MUCH ARE THE MUSSELS?

13:48.237 --> 13:51.077
LOOK IN THE COMPUTER, TRACI,
AND FIND OUT.

13:51.077 --> 13:52.872
SISTER.

13:52.872 --> 13:55.878
WOW, YOU REALLY
JUST SAID THAT TO ME.
YOU SHOULD KNOW, $10.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.509
<i>YOU DIDN'T KNOW, YOU OWN</i>
<i>THE  PLACE, SISTER.</i>

13:58.509 --> 14:00.000
I KNOW, $10.
YOU SHOULD KNOW TOO.
AW, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.472
I KNOW, $10.
YOU SHOULD KNOW TOO.
AW, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

14:01.472 --> 14:03.351
IT'S $10.

14:03.351 --> 14:04.729
HOW HARD WAS THAT
TO TELL ME

14:04.729 --> 14:08.361
WHEN I'M DEALING
WITH THIS?

14:11.868 --> 14:13.914
UGH.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A MUSSEL.

14:13.914 --> 14:16.085
IT'S A  CLOVE
OF GARLIC.

14:16.085 --> 14:17.379
DAMN.

14:17.379 --> 14:18.715
$10, CHEF.

14:18.715 --> 14:21.053
HOLY CRAP.
THEY TASTE FROZEN.

14:21.053 --> 14:22.472
CAN YOU JUST CHECK
WITH THE CHEF?

14:22.472 --> 14:23.976
BECAUSE THEY ARE
SO CHEWY.

14:23.976 --> 14:26.063
YES, I WILL, CHEF.
<i>YEAH, PLEASE?</i>

14:26.063 --> 14:27.859
MAN.

14:27.859 --> 14:29.236
ARE THE MUSSELS FROZEN?

14:29.236 --> 14:30.000
YES.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.240
YES.

14:32.409 --> 14:33.662
WE SHOULD HAVE FRESH MUSSELS.

14:33.662 --> 14:35.331
WE CANNOT HAVE
FRESH MUSSELS

14:35.331 --> 14:37.545
WHEN WE HAVE A MENU
THAT'S EXTREMELY LARGE.

14:37.545 --> 14:38.881
THEY TASTE SO--

14:38.881 --> 14:41.468
YES, CHEF,
THEY ARE FROZEN.

14:41.468 --> 14:43.974
OH, HOLD ON A MINUTE,
HOLD ON A MINUTE, COME ON.

14:43.974 --> 14:45.059
CAN YOU COME IN THE KITCHEN
WITH ME?

14:45.059 --> 14:46.228
<i>YES, SIR.</i>

14:46.228 --> 14:49.401
SO FAR,
HE LIKES NOTHING.

14:49.401 --> 14:52.407
I'M GONNA START FLIPPING OUT
IN TWO SECONDS.

14:59.839 --> 15:01.760
AFTER OWNER
ROSARIA'S DESCRIPTION

15:01.760 --> 15:03.972
OF BELLA LUNA'S FOOD
AS AUTHENTIC AND FRESH...

15:03.972 --> 15:05.141
DISGUSTING.

15:05.141 --> 15:07.270
CHEF RAMSAY
IS BEYOND DISAPPOINTED,

15:07.270 --> 15:09.525
AND HE IS IN NEED
OF AN EXPLANATION.

15:09.525 --> 15:11.947
OKAY, COME OVER.

15:11.947 --> 15:14.117
UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO START.

15:14.117 --> 15:17.374
MY EXPERIENCE AT LUNCHTIME
WAS DREADFUL,

15:17.374 --> 15:20.798
AND THERE WAS NOTHING AUTHENTIC
IN WHAT YOU JUST SERVED ME,

15:20.798 --> 15:22.802
<i>AND I'M STRUGGLING.</i>

15:22.802 --> 15:24.096
THE BIG KICK

15:24.096 --> 15:26.141
THE MUSSELS
ARE ACTUALLY FROZEN.

15:26.141 --> 15:27.021
WHY ARE YOU SERVING
FROZEN MUSSELS?

15:27.021 --> 15:29.022
WHY ARE YOU SERVING
FROZEN MUSSELS?

15:29.022 --> 15:31.235
<i>NO, AND I NEED TO KNOW</i>
<i>BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME FRESH.</i>

15:31.235 --> 15:33.657
I'M ONLY GOING
ON WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

15:33.657 --> 15:35.076
WE DON'T SELL
ENOUGH MUSSELS

15:35.076 --> 15:36.370
FOR ME TO HAVE THEM
FRESH EVERY WEEK.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.082
SO THEN WHAT'S
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

15:38.082 --> 15:39.084
TO DO ABOUT THAT DISH?

15:39.084 --> 15:40.086
TAKE IT OFF THE MENU.

15:40.086 --> 15:41.088
TAKE THEM OFF THE MENU.

15:41.088 --> 15:44.303
SO WHY HAVEN'T YOU?

15:44.303 --> 15:45.764
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO TAKE THINGS OFF THE MENU.

15:45.764 --> 15:46.766
SHE.
WHO IS SHE?

15:46.766 --> 15:49.104
MY MOTHER.

15:49.104 --> 15:50.481
WHY WON'T SHE DO IT?

15:50.481 --> 15:53.697
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE WE CAN'T
AFFORD TO MAKE NEW MENUS.

15:53.697 --> 15:56.911
I TRY NOT TO HAVE ANYTHING
FROZEN ON THE MENU.

15:56.911 --> 15:57.021
STOP, "I TRY NOT TO HAVE
ANYTHING FROZEN ON THE MENU."

15:57.021 --> 16:00.001
STOP, "I TRY NOT TO HAVE
ANYTHING FROZEN ON THE MENU."

16:00.001 --> 16:01.003
DID YOU JUST SAY THAT?

16:01.003 --> 16:01.963
YES, YOU DID SAY THAT,
BUT THEN--

16:01.963 --> 16:02.965
RIGHT, SO THEY'RE FROZEN.

16:02.965 --> 16:05.136
THEN HIM, AS A CHEF,
HE SHOULD TELL ME,

16:05.136 --> 16:06.138
"TAKE THEM OFF THE MENU."
I DID TELL YOU.

16:06.138 --> 16:07.516
HIM, AS A CHEF?

16:07.516 --> 16:09.812
I DID TELL YOU.
YES, TAKE THEM OFF THE MENU.

16:09.812 --> 16:12.568
WHY IS IT STILL ON?

16:12.568 --> 16:13.987
<i>WHY?</i>

16:13.987 --> 16:14.989
IT'S STILL ON
BECAUSE THERE'S

16:14.989 --> 16:16.993
A CONSTANT CIRCLE
OF MISCOMMUNICATION.

16:16.993 --> 16:18.496
WHO WANTS IT OFF?
WHO WANTS IT ON?

16:18.496 --> 16:21.503
AND IT STILL STAYS ON
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

16:21.503 --> 16:22.588
<i>- I'LL TELL YOU</i>-

16:22.588 --> 16:25.844
THINKING THAT YOU CAN JUST
BUY A RESTAURANT

16:25.844 --> 16:27.021
BECAUSE IT--
IT SUCCUMBS TO YOUR DREAMS.

16:27.021 --> 16:29.519
BECAUSE IT--
IT SUCCUMBS TO YOUR DREAMS.

16:29.519 --> 16:32.190
YOUR FUNDAMENTALS
ARE ALL SCREWED UP,

16:32.190 --> 16:33.693
<i>AND YOU HAVE</i>
<i>BIG ISSUES HERE,</i>

16:33.693 --> 16:36.908
FROM MAKING PASTA
TO PROPER SEASONING.

16:36.908 --> 16:39.496
YOU'VE GOT MORE CHANCE
WINNING THE LOTTERY

16:39.496 --> 16:42.753
THAN YOU HAVE
BECOMING A SUCCESS HERE.

16:51.980 --> 16:54.861
CAN YOU READ THAT?

16:54.861 --> 16:57.021
UH...

16:57.021 --> 16:57.198
UH...

16:57.198 --> 17:00.371
GOOD EVENING, JUST GIVE ME
A QUICK RUN-THROUGH.

17:00.371 --> 17:03.169
HOW DOES THE LINE WORK?
WHO DOES WHAT?

17:03.169 --> 17:05.465
HE STAYS ON THAT SIDE.
I STAY ON THIS SIDE.

17:05.465 --> 17:07.051
WE TRY NOT TO, LIKE,
CROSS EACH OTHER,

17:07.051 --> 17:08.555
SO WE DON'T STEP
ON EACH OTHER'S TOES.

17:08.555 --> 17:09.891
WHY CAN'T WE GET TICKETS?

17:09.891 --> 17:11.143
THESE ARE
WHAT WE HAVE.

17:11.143 --> 17:12.479
ARE THEY JUST ON BITS
OF PAPER LIKE THAT?

17:12.479 --> 17:14.065
<i>YES, YOU HAVE BITS OF PAPER</i>
<i>LIKE THAT.</i>

17:14.065 --> 17:15.359
THAT'S INSANE.

17:15.359 --> 17:17.573
THERE'S NO PROPER TICKETS.

17:21.915 --> 17:25.129
SHOW ME
THOSE SHRIMP, PLEASE.

17:25.129 --> 17:27.008
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?
THE MICROWAVE, DUSTIN?

17:27.008 --> 17:27.021
YEAH, WE DEFROST THEM
IN THE MICROWAVE.

17:27.021 --> 17:29.054
YEAH, WE DEFROST THEM
IN THE MICROWAVE.

17:29.054 --> 17:30.056
SO FROZEN SHRIMP.

17:30.056 --> 17:32.060
YEP.

17:32.060 --> 17:36.653
FANTASTIC.
OKAY.

17:36.653 --> 17:40.284
WHAT'S THAT IN THERE?

17:40.284 --> 17:42.873
DEFROSTING CHICKEN IN
A WASH-HAND BASIN FULL OF BLOOD.

17:42.873 --> 17:45.963
AND THEN WE'RE PREPPING IT
NEXT TO A COOKED MEATBALL.

17:45.963 --> 17:47.465
WOW.

17:47.465 --> 17:49.720
HERE, GO AHEAD.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.181
I'M NOT SEEING
VERY MUCH

17:51.181 --> 17:52.643
WHAT YOU'RE PORTRAYING
ON THE FRONT OF THE MENU,

17:52.643 --> 17:53.728
YOU KNOW,
THE FRESH INGREDIENTS,

17:53.728 --> 17:54.897
AND PLEASE BE UNDERSTANDING.

17:54.897 --> 17:56.149
YOU KNOW
THE CHICKEN'S FROZEN?

17:56.149 --> 17:57.021
THE CHICKEN,
WE BUY FRESH.

17:57.021 --> 17:58.947
THE CHICKEN,
WE BUY FRESH.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.617
THE CHICKEN'S FROZEN.
WHY DON'T YOU COME AROUND?

18:00.617 --> 18:02.955
<i>I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE THE--</i>
MM-HMM.

18:02.955 --> 18:04.876
WERE THOSE CHICKEN BREASTS
FROZEN?

18:04.876 --> 18:06.086
YEAH, THEY WERE.
THANK YOU.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.882
THE CHICKEN'S NOT FRESH.
IT'S FROZEN.

18:07.882 --> 18:09.594
<i>WE'RE DEFROSTING IT HERE</i>
<i>IN THE WASH-HAND BASIN.</i>

18:09.594 --> 18:11.138
<i>SEE THAT BLOOD THERE?</i>

18:11.138 --> 18:12.307
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT THIS IS FROZEN?

18:12.307 --> 18:13.309
YOU'RE YELLING AT ME.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.562
THIS IS AN ISSUE
THAT YOU SHOULD

18:14.562 --> 18:16.189
TAKE UP WITH THE CHEF.

18:16.189 --> 18:17.358
DO YOU KNOW
WE DEFROST THE SHRIMP

18:17.358 --> 18:18.360
IN THE MICROWAVE
BEFORE WE SERVE IT TO THEM?

18:18.360 --> 18:20.949
NO, I KNOW THAT WE PUT IT
IN ICE WATER.

18:20.949 --> 18:22.493
WHAT?

18:22.493 --> 18:23.663
DUSTIN?
YES.

18:23.663 --> 18:25.584
YOU WERE DEFROSTING
THE FROZEN SHRIMP WHERE?

18:25.584 --> 18:27.021
IN THE MICROWAVE.
WE DON'T PUT THEM IN THE WATER?

18:27.021 --> 18:27.671
IN THE MICROWAVE.
WE DON'T PUT THEM IN THE WATER?

18:27.671 --> 18:29.842
<i>NO.</i>

18:29.842 --> 18:31.094
OKAY, SO YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME ANY OF THIS

18:31.094 --> 18:32.138
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU.

18:32.138 --> 18:33.767
ALL YOU TOLD ME ABOUT
WAS YOUR FRESHNESS.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.436
YOU TURNED AROUND
AND SAID THE--

18:35.436 --> 18:37.691
THE AUTHENTICITY
AND WHAT YOU STAND FOR.

18:37.691 --> 18:38.652
THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

18:38.652 --> 18:40.488
RIGHT, AND I STILL BELIEVE
IN THAT.

18:40.488 --> 18:41.824
YOU BELIEVE IN IT, BUT YOU'RE
NOT ACTUALLY PRACTICING IT.

18:41.824 --> 18:43.077
YES.

18:43.077 --> 18:44.496
SO YOU'RE SAYING ONE THING
AND DOING THE OPPOSITE.

18:44.496 --> 18:46.166
RIGHT.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.045
HELL.
WHAT?

18:48.045 --> 18:50.174
AFTER FEELING MISLED
BY ROSARIA

18:50.174 --> 18:52.178
ABOUT THE FRESHNESS
OF THE FOOD...

18:52.178 --> 18:53.807
UGH, GOD.

18:53.807 --> 18:55.059
CHEF RAMSAY DECIDES TO DO

18:55.059 --> 18:57.021
A LITTLE INVESTIGATING
TO FIND OUT

18:57.021 --> 18:57.063
A LITTLE INVESTIGATING
TO FIND OUT

18:57.063 --> 18:59.192
WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON
IN THIS RESTAURANT.

18:59.192 --> 19:01.488
UGH, HOW MUCH CHICKEN

19:01.488 --> 19:04.870
DOES ONE RESTAURANT NEED?

19:04.870 --> 19:07.333
CALAMARI'S NOT EVEN FROZEN.

19:07.333 --> 19:09.547
DOWN HERE--WOW.

19:09.547 --> 19:11.174
MY DELICIOUS ITALIAN MUSSELS.

19:14.139 --> 19:16.059
HAVE YOU GOT
TWO SECONDS, ROSARIA?

19:16.059 --> 19:17.061
WHAT HAPPENED NOW?

19:17.061 --> 19:19.024
HOW MUCH CHICKEN

19:19.024 --> 19:20.151
DO YOU THINK
YOU HAVE IN THE FREEZER?

19:20.151 --> 19:21.194
I DON'T KNOW.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.240
LET ME SHOW YOU.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.021
I RARELY COME DOWN HERE,
SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

19:27.021 --> 19:27.248
I RARELY COME DOWN HERE,
SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

19:33.177 --> 19:34.471
<i>WE BUY IT FRESH.</i>
<i>IT'S FRESH.</i>

19:34.471 --> 19:38.020
REALLY?
JUST--

19:38.020 --> 19:39.857
THAT'S THE CALAMARI
WE GOT TODAY.

19:39.857 --> 19:41.359
FROZEN AT THE BOTTOM?
RIGHT.

19:41.359 --> 19:42.654
HOLD IT.

19:42.654 --> 19:44.324
WE GOT IT IN
THIS MORNING.

19:44.324 --> 19:46.871
AND WE'RE FREEZING IT,

19:46.871 --> 19:47.956
AND THEN
WE'RE DEFROSTING IT

19:47.956 --> 19:49.209
TO SEND IT BACK OUT.

19:49.209 --> 19:51.171
WHY SHOULD ANYBODY WAIT

19:51.171 --> 19:52.381
FOR  LIKE THIS?

19:52.381 --> 19:56.808
I SAW THE CALAMARI BRING IN--
FRESH TODAY.

19:56.808 --> 19:57.021
IT'S FRESH.
WE BRING IT IN FRESH.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.728
IT'S FRESH.
WE BRING IT IN FRESH.

19:58.728 --> 20:00.356
WE GOT THE DELIVERY
THIS MORNING.

20:00.356 --> 20:03.070
ARE YOU CRAZY?

20:03.070 --> 20:04.489
SO WHY ARE YOU
IN DENIAL?

20:04.489 --> 20:07.161
THE KITCHEN IS NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

20:07.161 --> 20:10.585
I HAVE ENOUGH RESPONSIBILITIES,
GORDON.

20:10.585 --> 20:11.712
AM I A SUPERWOMAN?

20:11.712 --> 20:13.048
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW?

20:13.048 --> 20:15.010
I DON'T HAVE 20 YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.724
IF YOU ARE MAKING
THE STATEMENT

20:17.724 --> 20:20.271
<i>OF BEING FRESH,</i>
<i>BEING AUTHENTIC,</i>

20:20.271 --> 20:23.026
YOU DON'T NEED
20 YEARS' EXPERIENCE.

20:23.026 --> 20:24.279
YOU SHOULD KNOW EVERYTHING.

20:24.279 --> 20:25.991
YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON IN EVERY FRIDGE.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.021
SO IT'S MY FAULT?

20:27.021 --> 20:27.703
SO IT'S MY FAULT?

20:27.703 --> 20:29.205
SO IF IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
THEN WHOSE IS IT?

20:29.205 --> 20:33.172
I'M NOT THE CHEF, GORDON.

20:33.172 --> 20:37.138
YOU'RE POINTING
EVERYTHING OUT ON ME.

20:37.138 --> 20:38.558
STAY HERE, AND LET ME GO
AND GET HIM.

20:38.558 --> 20:40.019
GO AHEAD.
YEAH.

20:40.019 --> 20:42.106
RAMSAY'S DOWN
IN THE BASEMENT.

20:42.106 --> 20:43.317
<i>UH-OH.</i>
YEAH, UH-OH.

20:46.323 --> 20:48.368
HAVE YOU GOT TWO SECONDS?
YEAH.

20:48.368 --> 20:51.082
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
LET ME SHOW YOU.

20:59.140 --> 21:00.852
YOU DON'T PREP
THAT MUCH CHICKEN

21:00.852 --> 21:01.854
AND THEN FREEZE IT
LIKE THAT.

21:01.854 --> 21:04.067
WE BUY THEM FRESH,
AND WE BREAD THEM,

21:04.067 --> 21:04.944
AND WE MAKE THEM
OURSELVES.

21:04.944 --> 21:06.906
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT,

21:06.906 --> 21:09.244
SO I SAT THERE LIKE AN IDIOT,
BELIEVING YOU.

21:09.244 --> 21:10.789
I DIDN'T CALL YOU
AN IDIOT.

21:10.789 --> 21:13.043
I'M CALLING MYSELF
AN IDIOT

21:13.043 --> 21:14.922
BECAUSE I BELIEVED YOU.

21:14.922 --> 21:18.680
YOU'RE ALLOWING THESE PRACTICES
TO HAPPEN,

21:18.680 --> 21:20.517
MAKING FALSE CLAIMS.

21:20.517 --> 21:21.978
I'M NOT A FAN
OF FROZEN FOOD.

21:21.978 --> 21:24.440
I DON'T--I DON'T GET THIS.
<i>I DON'T LIKE FROZEN FOOD.</i>

21:24.440 --> 21:25.610
YOU'RE ENDORSING IT.

21:25.610 --> 21:27.021
YOU RUN A BUSINESS
SELLING IT.

21:27.021 --> 21:30.035
YOU RUN A BUSINESS
SELLING IT.

21:30.035 --> 21:31.079
<i>I--LIKE I SAID,</i>
<i>I DON'T--</i>

21:31.079 --> 21:34.043
YOU'RE SAYING NO.
THIS IS INSANE.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.507
YOU DON'T LIKE
FROZEN FOOD.

21:36.507 --> 21:38.468
I DON'T LIKE
FROZEN FOOD.

21:38.468 --> 21:40.974
WHAT THE?

21:40.974 --> 21:42.143
I DON'T LIKE
FROZEN FOOD.

21:42.143 --> 21:44.480
SO YOU HAVE THE NERVE
TO SERVE IT TO YOUR CUSTOMERS?

21:44.480 --> 21:47.153
SO IT'S NOT WORKING
BECAUSE THIS IS FROZEN?

21:47.153 --> 21:49.073
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME?

21:49.073 --> 21:51.494
IF SOMETHING IS FROZEN,
IT'S BAD?

21:51.494 --> 21:54.083
IF IT STAYS FROZEN,
IT'S BAD?

21:54.083 --> 21:56.046
COME ON.

21:56.046 --> 21:57.021
YOU CAN'T BE THIS NAIVE.

21:57.021 --> 21:58.551
YOU CAN'T BE THIS NAIVE.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.012
I DON'T KNOW
WHY WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE

22:00.012 --> 22:02.016
COMING THROUGH THE DOOR.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.018
I FEEL LIKE SCREAMING

22:03.018 --> 22:04.187
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE IN DENIAL.

22:04.187 --> 22:06.650
THIS IS NOT COST CONTROL.

22:06.650 --> 22:08.696
THIS IS STUPIDITY
AT ITS BEST.

22:08.696 --> 22:11.242
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE
A CULINARY GENIUS

22:11.242 --> 22:14.248
TO IDENTIFY
HOW BAD THIS IS.

22:17.338 --> 22:18.633
WHY DIDN'T YOU STICK UP?

22:18.633 --> 22:20.512
HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNEW IT
FROM THE MINUTE

22:20.512 --> 22:21.806
<i>WE CAME IN HERE, MA.</i>

22:21.806 --> 22:25.396
OKAY.
THAT'S--THAT'S SO WRONG.

22:25.396 --> 22:27.021
HE WANTS TO HEAR IT
FROM YOU.

22:27.021 --> 22:27.316
HE WANTS TO HEAR IT
FROM YOU.

22:27.316 --> 22:29.530
I WOULD SAY
IT'S MY MOTHER'S FAULT.

22:29.530 --> 22:30.990
IT'S HER RESTAURANT.

22:30.990 --> 22:34.497
AND I MIGHT BE POINTED
AS THE BAD GUY, BUT I'M NOT.

22:47.147 --> 22:49.944
AFTER BEING FRUSTRATED
WITH GIANFRANCO AND ROSARIA

22:49.944 --> 22:51.920
OVER THE DEPLORABLE STATE
OF THEIR FOOD STORAGE,

22:51.920 --> 22:53.298
CHEF RAMSAY
HEADS BACK UPSTAIRS

22:53.298 --> 22:56.596
TO SEE WHAT'S INSIDE
THE WALK-IN REFRIGERATOR.

22:56.596 --> 22:58.725
UGH.
LOOK AT THAT.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.813
A LIZARD IN A DESERT
WOULDN'T EAT THAT.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.692
WOW.
ROTTEN THROUGH AND THROUGH.

23:02.692 --> 23:04.696
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.

23:04.696 --> 23:05.739
FRESH TURNIPS.

23:05.739 --> 23:07.743
OH, MY GOD.

23:07.743 --> 23:10.081
UGH.
LOOK AT THE COLOR OF THAT.

23:10.081 --> 23:11.277
IT MAKES ME GAG.

23:11.277 --> 23:11.668
IT MAKES ME GAG.

23:11.668 --> 23:12.712
THAT IS VEAL.

23:12.712 --> 23:16.845
OH, YOU DIRTY BASTARD.

23:16.845 --> 23:18.432
ROSARIA, WHAT THE
IS THAT?

23:18.432 --> 23:19.851
THESE ARE MY--
I DON'T SERVE THESE.

23:19.851 --> 23:21.605
THESE ARE MINE.

23:21.605 --> 23:22.773
HOW MANY TIMES A DAY

23:22.773 --> 23:24.109
DO YOU GO
INTO THAT WALK-IN, ROUGHLY?

23:24.109 --> 23:27.283
ABOUT A HUNDRED.
A HUNDRED.

23:27.283 --> 23:29.370
DISGUSTING.

23:29.370 --> 23:30.456
HOLD THAT.

23:30.456 --> 23:31.833
THAT'S BROCCOLI RABE

23:31.833 --> 23:33.337
LEFT OVER
FROM MY BROTHER'S WEDDING.

23:33.337 --> 23:35.382
THEY'RE LEFT OVER
FROM YOUR BROTHER'S WEDDING.
YEAH.

23:35.382 --> 23:37.010
<i>COME ON, GUYS.</i>

23:37.010 --> 23:39.014
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA

23:39.014 --> 23:41.277
HOW BAD A TURNIP
NEEDS TO GO

23:41.277 --> 23:41.561
HOW BAD A TURNIP
NEEDS TO GO

23:41.561 --> 23:43.105
BEFORE IT GETS THAT BAD?

23:43.105 --> 23:44.609
TOUCH THAT.

23:44.609 --> 23:46.655
<i>J-JUST TOUCH IT.</i>
<i>JUST--JUST--JUST--</i>

23:46.655 --> 23:48.074
I'M NOT SERVING IT.

23:48.074 --> 23:49.869
<i>WE'RE NOT USING IT.</i>

23:49.869 --> 23:51.706
NO DISRESPECT,

23:51.706 --> 23:54.837
BUT WHAT WOULD YOU KNOW
IS BEING SERVED?

23:54.837 --> 23:56.633
NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHY THAT'S THERE.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

23:56.633 --> 23:59.054
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.
- I AM  PISSED OFF.

23:59.054 --> 24:01.893
WAIT, IT GETS WORSE.
NOBODY--NOBODY THROWS
ANYTHING OUT.

24:01.893 --> 24:04.732
I CANNOT WAIT
FOR THIS  EXCUSE.

24:04.732 --> 24:07.822
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA
HOW BAD

24:07.822 --> 24:10.911
A SLICE OF VEAL NEEDS TO GO
THAT COLOR?

24:10.911 --> 24:11.277
JUST SMELL THAT.

24:11.277 --> 24:14.210
JUST SMELL THAT.

24:14.210 --> 24:15.462
IT SMELLS BAD.

24:15.462 --> 24:16.631
HOW LONG IS THAT THERE?

24:16.631 --> 24:18.260
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
TWO DAYS, MA.

24:18.260 --> 24:20.556
OH,  OFF.
TWO DAYS?

24:20.556 --> 24:22.935
WHAT IN THE
IS GOING ON?

24:24.897 --> 24:26.860
YOU DON'T  CARE,
DO YOU?

24:26.860 --> 24:29.907
- OF COURSE I DO CARE.
- YOU DON'T GIVE A.

24:29.907 --> 24:30.909
SAYS WHO?

24:30.909 --> 24:33.832
THAT WALK-IN THERE
IS A DISGUSTING MESS.

24:33.832 --> 24:35.294
<i>YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.</i>

24:35.294 --> 24:36.838
<i>HAIR IN THE FOOD.</i>

24:36.838 --> 24:37.882
HAIR IN THE FOOD?

24:37.882 --> 24:39.594
WHO JUST SAID,
"HAIR IN THE FOOD"?

24:39.594 --> 24:41.277
ME.
<i>IS THIS A JOKE?</i>

24:41.277 --> 24:41.348
ME.
<i>IS THIS A JOKE?</i>

24:41.348 --> 24:42.767
COME AROUND.

24:42.767 --> 24:44.019
OH, NO, I THINK SHE'S TALKING
TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

24:44.019 --> 24:47.777
IF YOU WERE
EXAMINED TONIGHT,

24:47.777 --> 24:49.697
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WOULD HAPPEN?

24:49.697 --> 24:51.701
CLOSE YOU DOWN.
WE'D CLOSE DOWN.

24:51.701 --> 24:53.037
CAN YOU GO OUT THERE

24:53.037 --> 24:55.417
AND APOLOGIZE
TO EVERY CUSTOMER?

24:55.417 --> 24:58.298
YES.
I AM SHUTTING IT DOWN.

25:01.888 --> 25:04.936
MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

25:04.936 --> 25:09.529
WE HERE AT BELLA LUNA APOLOGIZE
FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE

25:09.529 --> 25:11.277
<i>TO YOU WONDERFUL PEOPLE</i>
<i>OF THIS COMMUNITY TONIGHT,</i>

25:11.277 --> 25:12.075
<i>TO YOU WONDERFUL PEOPLE</i>
<i>OF THIS COMMUNITY TONIGHT,</i>

25:12.075 --> 25:14.539
BUT WE ARE
SHUTTING IT DOWN.

25:14.539 --> 25:19.047
WE ARE NOT WORTHY
TO CONTINUE THIS SERVICE.

25:19.047 --> 25:20.884
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S BEEN SHUT DOWN.

25:20.884 --> 25:22.263
CAN WE CLOSE
THAT DOOR, PLEASE?

25:22.263 --> 25:23.682
IT'S JUST GONNA KEEP GETTING
HOTTER IN THERE,

25:23.682 --> 25:25.727
AND MORE STUFF
IS GONNA GO BAD.

25:25.727 --> 25:27.273
<i>WHAT MORE STUFF</i>
<i>CAN GET WORSE?</i>

25:27.273 --> 25:28.859
TELL ME.

25:28.859 --> 25:29.902
I HAVE NO CLUE.

25:29.902 --> 25:31.698
AND NOW
IN THE LAST 60 SECONDS,

25:31.698 --> 25:32.908
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU GIVE A

25:32.908 --> 25:34.912
<i>ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA GO ON?</i>

25:34.912 --> 25:37.083
YOU GOT LAZY.

25:37.083 --> 25:40.591
AND YET,
YOU CANNOT ACCEPT IT.

25:50.235 --> 25:52.490
YOU'RE DONE, AREN'T YOU?
YOU'RE--YOU'RE FINISHED?

25:52.490 --> 25:53.909
WHAT DO YOU MEAN FINISHED?
FOR THE NIGHT?

25:53.909 --> 25:55.245
OH, NO,
NOT FOR THE NIGHT,

25:55.245 --> 25:57.708
BUT JUST IN GENERAL.
YOU'RE A SPENT FORCE.

25:57.708 --> 25:58.752
NO.
IT'S NOT WHO I AM.

25:58.752 --> 26:00.839
REALLY?
<i>YEAH, I HAVEN'T GAVE UP.</i>

26:00.839 --> 26:02.259
IF I HAVE,
I WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU.

26:02.259 --> 26:03.929
I WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU
HERE BY YOURSELF.

26:03.929 --> 26:06.392
<i>IT'S NOT MY FAULT.</i>

26:06.392 --> 26:07.520
SHE THOUGHT
EVERYTHING COULD WORK.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.022
SHE THOUGHT IT WAS EASY,

26:09.022 --> 26:11.109
AND I TOLD HER
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.

26:11.109 --> 26:11.277
WELL, HOW ABOUT
YOU STEPPING UP?

26:11.277 --> 26:13.281
WELL, HOW ABOUT
YOU STEPPING UP?

26:15.244 --> 26:18.082
<i>ALL THE PRESSURE,</i>
<i>ALL THE TENSION,</i>

26:18.082 --> 26:19.252
IT'S BUILDING ON TOP,

26:19.252 --> 26:20.420
AND ME NOT
GETTING PAID, AND--

26:20.420 --> 26:21.714
THERE'S A REASON
WHY YOU HAVEN'T HAD

26:21.714 --> 26:25.054
A  PAYCHECK
IN TWO YEARS.

26:25.054 --> 26:27.518
DO YOU EVER STOP
AND ASK YOURSELVES?

26:27.518 --> 26:28.937
YOU ARE MAKING
SO MANY MISTAKES,

26:28.937 --> 26:31.149
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S RIGHT OR WRONG,

26:31.149 --> 26:33.822
AND YOU'RE ALLOWING HIM
TO DO IT.

26:33.822 --> 26:37.078
<i>YOU'RE BOTH</i>
<i>DESTROYING EACH OTHER.</i>

26:37.078 --> 26:39.625
I'M AMAZED YOU'VE STAYED OPEN
FOR THREE  YEARS.

26:39.625 --> 26:41.277
AND I CAN'T DO
EVERYTHING FOR THEM.

26:41.277 --> 26:42.715
AND I CAN'T DO
EVERYTHING FOR THEM.

26:42.715 --> 26:44.885
I CANNOT BE
CHECKING PRODUCE.

26:44.885 --> 26:46.723
WHY DID YOU BUY
A RESTAURANT

26:46.723 --> 26:50.939
WHEN NONE OF YOU
WORKED IN ONE?

26:52.693 --> 26:54.070
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

26:54.070 --> 26:55.282
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, CHEF.

26:55.282 --> 26:56.826
THAT MAKES THREE OF US,

26:56.826 --> 26:58.788
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW,
I'VE GOT

26:58.788 --> 27:00.959
NO IDEA

27:00.959 --> 27:03.047
A CHEF
THAT'S CHECKED OUT,

27:03.047 --> 27:05.009
THAT HAS GIVEN UP,
AND AN OWNER

27:05.009 --> 27:07.514
THAT'S IN  DENIAL.

27:07.514 --> 27:09.644
I'M NOT IN DENIAL.

27:09.644 --> 27:11.021
I'M NOT.

27:17.033 --> 27:18.495
<i>YOU CAN SHOW HIM</i>
<i>A LOT BETTER THAN THIS, GIAF.</i>

27:18.495 --> 27:19.789
<i>I KNOW YOU CAN.</i>

27:19.789 --> 27:23.213
COME ON,
THAT WALK-IN'S NOT THAT BIG.

27:23.213 --> 27:25.717
SOMETHING'S GOTTA
CHANGE HERE, MAN.

27:25.717 --> 27:27.011
<i>THE CARDS</i>
<i>ARE LAID OUT.</i>

27:27.011 --> 27:29.392
<i>EITHER WE GO ALL IN,</i>
<i>OR WE TURN AROUND.</i>

27:29.392 --> 27:30.936
WE'RE NOT MAKING
ANY MONEY.

27:30.936 --> 27:33.858
WE HAVEN'T MADE
ANY MONEY.

27:33.858 --> 27:36.364
AND NOW,
WE RAN OUT OF HEART.

27:36.364 --> 27:37.533
<i>GIAF, YOU KNOW</i>
<i>WHAT TO DO.</i>

27:37.533 --> 27:39.203
<i>YOU JUST LOST YOURSELF.</i>

27:39.203 --> 27:40.539
YOU WERE TAUGHT RIGHT,

27:40.539 --> 27:41.277
AND YOU HAVE TRADITIONS
FROM OUR FAMILY.

27:41.277 --> 27:43.127
AND YOU HAVE TRADITIONS
FROM OUR FAMILY.

27:43.127 --> 27:47.219
YOU JUST GOT TO PUT THAT BACK
IN PLAY, YOU KNOW?

27:55.944 --> 27:57.113
COME IN, GUYS.

27:57.113 --> 27:59.535
FED UP WITH BOTH
ROSARIA AND GIANFRANCO,

27:59.535 --> 28:02.123
CHEF RAMSAY HAS DEVISED A PLAN
TO GET EVERYTHING,

28:02.123 --> 28:05.380
ONCE AND FOR ALL,
OUT INTO THE OPEN.

28:05.380 --> 28:08.303
<i>OKAY, GIANFRANCO, ROSARIA.</i>

28:08.303 --> 28:11.726
EACH OF YOU
IS GOING ON TRIAL.

28:11.726 --> 28:13.980
ONE AT A TIME,
YOU'RE GONNA COME UP HERE

28:13.980 --> 28:15.442
AND DEFEND YOURSELF.

28:15.442 --> 28:17.069
GOT IT?

28:17.069 --> 28:19.115
<i>ROSARIA, I'D LIKE YOU</i>
<i>TO GO FIRST.</i>

28:19.115 --> 28:20.460
<i>COME ON.</i>
<i>COME ON DOWN.</i>

28:20.460 --> 28:20.494
<i>COME ON.</i>
<i>COME ON DOWN.</i>

28:20.494 --> 28:22.247
<i>OKAY.</i>

28:22.247 --> 28:23.333
TAKE THE PODIUM.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.752
THANK YOU.

28:24.752 --> 28:26.631
THANK YOU.

28:26.631 --> 28:28.384
<i>NOW, TRACI,</i>

28:28.384 --> 28:32.226
<i>ROSARIA'S WEAKNESSES,</i>
<i>WHAT ARE THEY?</i>

28:32.226 --> 28:36.024
VERY WEAK IN DISCIPLINE
WITH THE STAFF.

28:36.024 --> 28:38.111
<i>SHE NEEDS TO BE</i>

28:38.111 --> 28:40.242
TOUGHER ON THE BACK KITCHEN.

28:40.242 --> 28:42.746
SHE NEEDS TO BE TOUGHER
ON THE FRONT.

28:42.746 --> 28:45.627
OKAY, BUT I DON'T THINK
I'M WEAK.

28:45.627 --> 28:48.090
<i>PEOPLE DO MISTAKE</i>
<i>MY KINDNESS FOR WEAKNESS,</i>

28:48.090 --> 28:49.718
BUT I'M NOT
A WEAK PERSON.

28:49.718 --> 28:50.460
<i>BUT YOU'RE WEAK--</i>
<i>YOU'RE WEAK</i>

28:50.460 --> 28:51.430
<i>BUT YOU'RE WEAK--</i>
<i>YOU'RE WEAK</i>

28:51.430 --> 28:54.562
BECAUSE SHE LETS PEOPLE
WALK ALL OVER HER.

28:54.562 --> 28:56.399
SO THAT'S--THAT'S ONE POINT.
YEAH, I'M TOO NICE.

28:56.399 --> 28:57.985
GO AHEAD.
NEXT.

28:57.985 --> 28:59.613
UNORGANIZED.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.242
<i>MISMANAGEMENT.</i>

29:01.242 --> 29:03.036
<i>NO FOLLOW-THROUGH.</i>

29:03.036 --> 29:04.456
YOU KNOW.
YOU KNOW.

29:04.456 --> 29:05.625
BUT I'M ONE PERSON.

29:05.625 --> 29:08.256
I CANNOT BE
DOING EVERYTHING.

29:08.256 --> 29:10.134
IF MY JOB
WAS JUST TO MANAGE

29:10.134 --> 29:13.098
<i>AND SIT IN MY OFFICE</i>
<i>AND TAKE CARE OF MY BILLS,</i>

29:13.098 --> 29:14.893
I WOULD HAVE EVERYTHING
DOWN PAT.

29:14.893 --> 29:16.062
BUT I'M THERE SERVING.

29:16.062 --> 29:18.776
AND THAT'S WHAT IT SHOULD BE.
<i>I'M DOING BAR.</i>

29:18.776 --> 29:20.447
I FEEL LIKE
I'M HAVING A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

29:20.447 --> 29:20.460
AND NOBODY UNDERSTANDS.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.866
AND NOBODY UNDERSTANDS.

29:21.866 --> 29:22.868
AND THEN I WALK OUT,
AND YOU'RE CLEANING WINDOWS.

29:22.868 --> 29:23.911
<i>NOBODY GIVES A.</i>

29:23.911 --> 29:25.457
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I SAID TO YOU--

29:25.457 --> 29:27.126
<i>YEAH,</i>
<i>BECAUSE NOBODY CLEANS WINDOWS,</i>

29:27.126 --> 29:28.630
<i>AND I'M THERE CLEANING</i>

29:28.630 --> 29:30.759
INSTEAD OF GOING
INTO THE WALK-IN AND CHECKING

29:30.759 --> 29:32.888
TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY PRODUCE
THAT'S GOING BAD.

29:32.888 --> 29:36.312
<i>OKAY, LAST NIGHT WAS</i>
<i>AN EYE-OPENER FOR ME.</i>

29:36.312 --> 29:39.025
I DIDN'T HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT THE HELL

29:39.025 --> 29:41.822
GOES ON
INTO THAT WALK-IN.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.326
<i>OKAY, GIANFRANCO, YEAH?</i>

29:43.326 --> 29:45.288
UM, SHE'S TOO NICE,

29:45.288 --> 29:47.417
AND PEOPLE
STEP OVER HER, AND--

29:47.417 --> 29:49.170
SHE'S TOO NICE TO YOU TOO.

29:49.170 --> 29:50.460
<i>YEAH.</i>

29:50.460 --> 29:50.465
<i>YEAH.</i>

29:50.465 --> 29:51.592
<i>SHE BABIES YOU.</i>

29:51.592 --> 29:53.346
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED
A LONG TIME

29:53.346 --> 29:55.057
IF YOU WERE
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S KITCHEN.

29:55.057 --> 29:56.101
HOW ABOUT THAT?

29:56.101 --> 29:58.272
<i>HOW ABOUT STEPPING UP</i>
<i>TO YOUR PLATE</i>

29:58.272 --> 30:01.570
AND REALLY SHOW YOUR PASSION
THAT YOU LOST?

30:01.570 --> 30:03.866
<i>YOU LOST YOUR PASSION,</i>
<i>GIANFRANCO.</i>

30:03.866 --> 30:06.079
<i>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE--</i>
<i>THE PASSION THAT YOU HAD?</i>

30:06.079 --> 30:07.416
<i>YOU WANTED TO BE</i>
<i>A CHEF.</i>

30:07.416 --> 30:09.211
I DIDN'T PUSH YOU
TO BE A CHEF.

30:09.211 --> 30:12.007
THAT WAS YOUR DREAM
TO BE A CHEF.

30:12.007 --> 30:14.095
<i>YOU WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL.</i>
<i>YOU MADE IT HAPPEN.</i>

30:14.095 --> 30:16.015
GIAF, MAYBE THIS IS
THE WRONG WAY AROUND.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.143
HOW ABOUT YOU GETTING UP

30:17.143 --> 30:19.189
<i>AND SWAPPING PLACES</i>
<i>WITH YOUR MOTHER?</i>

30:19.189 --> 30:20.358
<i>LET'S GO.</i>

30:20.358 --> 30:20.460
BECAUSE IT'S JUST STARTING
TO SHIFT TO YOU, MY BOY.

30:20.460 --> 30:23.071
BECAUSE IT'S JUST STARTING
TO SHIFT TO YOU, MY BOY.

30:23.071 --> 30:26.412
<i>YOU ALSO HAVE</i>
<i>TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY</i>

30:26.412 --> 30:27.456
<i>FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS.</i>

30:27.456 --> 30:29.125
<i>I WILL CONTINUE.</i>

30:29.125 --> 30:30.462
WHY ARE YOU LETTING GO?

30:30.462 --> 30:32.047
WHY?

30:32.047 --> 30:33.801
I FEEL LIKE I DO
ALL THIS WORK,

30:33.801 --> 30:35.638
AND I DON'T GET
ANY CREDIT FOR IT,

30:35.638 --> 30:38.644
<i>AND I DON'T REALLY SHOW</i>
<i>MY TRUE PASSION</i>

30:38.644 --> 30:39.938
BECAUSE I'M JUST WORKING

30:39.938 --> 30:44.113
WITH THIS DISGUSTINGLY HUGE MENU
THAT I DO NOT LIKE.

30:44.113 --> 30:45.408
<i>YOU GOTTA TAKE</i>
<i>RESPONSIBILITY TOO.</i>

30:45.408 --> 30:47.537
IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S NOT JUST HERS.

30:47.537 --> 30:48.623
IT'S NOT JUST YOURS,
BUT, I MEAN,

30:48.623 --> 30:49.958
AT LEAST TAKE
YOUR HALF OF IT TOO.

30:49.958 --> 30:50.460
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME
AND THE MONEY TO GO--

30:50.460 --> 30:52.087
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME
AND THE MONEY TO GO--

30:52.087 --> 30:53.382
BUT I TELL HIM
TO TAKE OVER.

30:53.382 --> 30:55.553
YOU'RE THE CHEF.
MAKE A MENU, OKAY?

30:55.553 --> 30:57.891
IF HE TAKES THE BULL
BY ITS HORN

30:57.891 --> 31:01.105
AND HE JUST DOES IT,
I'M NOT GONNA SAY NO.

31:01.105 --> 31:02.234
<i>SO PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN.</i>

31:02.234 --> 31:07.117
GROW SOME BALLS
LIKE I ALWAYS TELL YOU.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.913
<i>YOU ARE A CHEF,</i>
<i>YOUNG MAN,</i>

31:08.913 --> 31:11.794
BUT YOU NEED TO--
YOU NEED TO FIND YOUR VOICE.

31:11.794 --> 31:12.796
<i>YOU'RE RIGHT, I DO.</i>

31:12.796 --> 31:14.550
<i>OKAY.</i>

31:14.550 --> 31:16.303
THANK YOU.

31:16.303 --> 31:17.430
<i>LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.</i>

31:17.430 --> 31:20.460
YOU NEED INPUT
FROM ANOTHER SOURCE.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.357
YOU NEED INPUT
FROM ANOTHER SOURCE.

31:22.357 --> 31:25.070
HANG ON A SECOND.

31:25.070 --> 31:27.242
COME IN, THANK YOU.

31:27.242 --> 31:28.452
BILL,
GOOD TO SEE YOU, SIR.

31:28.452 --> 31:30.206
THANK YOU.

31:30.206 --> 31:32.627
THIS IS BILL.
HI.

31:32.627 --> 31:34.548
AND HE BROUGHT
A FEW OF HIS FRIENDS.

31:34.548 --> 31:35.717
<i>TAKE A SEAT,</i>
<i>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.</i>

31:35.717 --> 31:38.723
<i>PLEASE COME THROUGH.</i>

31:38.723 --> 31:42.606
THESE PEOPLE REPRESENT
THE TOWN OF EASTON.

31:42.606 --> 31:44.108
<i>YOU'LL PROBABLY RECOGNIZE THEM</i>

31:44.108 --> 31:48.200
<i>BECAUSE THEY'VE ALL DINED</i>
<i>IN YOUR RESTAURANT, ROSARIA.</i>

31:48.200 --> 31:49.953
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

31:49.953 --> 31:50.460
THE OWNERS AND THE STAFF
NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU.

31:50.460 --> 31:51.790
THE OWNERS AND THE STAFF
NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU.

31:51.790 --> 31:54.045
WHAT WERE
YOUR RECENT EXPERIENCES

31:54.045 --> 31:56.467
WHEN YOU WENT
TO BELLA LUNA?

31:56.467 --> 31:58.262
<i>FIRE AWAY, PLEASE.</i>

31:58.262 --> 32:01.017
THERE WAS A FLY
IN THE WEDDING SOUP,

32:01.017 --> 32:03.522
AND IT WAS KIND OF
AN EMBARRASSMENT.

32:03.522 --> 32:04.942
AND WE JUST LEFT IT THERE

32:04.942 --> 32:06.110
BECAUSE WE JUST
DIDN'T WANT IT.

32:06.110 --> 32:07.112
<i>SOUP OF THE DAY.</i>

32:07.112 --> 32:09.368
ROSARIA, I MEAN,
ANYTHING TO SAY TO BILL?

32:09.368 --> 32:11.872
I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT.

32:11.872 --> 32:14.628
I-I JUST APOLOGIZE.

32:14.628 --> 32:16.047
WOW, THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

32:16.047 --> 32:17.049
NEXT, PLEASE.

32:17.049 --> 32:18.761
THE FOOD AND THE SERVICE

32:18.761 --> 32:20.460
HAVE BOTH BEEN SUBPAR.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.099
HAVE BOTH BEEN SUBPAR.

32:21.099 --> 32:23.187
ALL OF OUR ENTREES
CAME OUT AT DIFFERENT TIMES,

32:23.187 --> 32:26.986
MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT
TO ENJOY A FAMILY MEAL.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.324
THAT'S MY ISSUE
WITH FOOD BEING PREPARED

32:29.324 --> 32:32.205
AND SITTING ON THE LINE
'CAUSE WE'RE SHORT-STAFFED.

32:32.205 --> 32:33.332
IT'S NOT
THE CUSTOMER'S PROBLEM

32:33.332 --> 32:35.503
THAT YOU'RE
SHORT-STAFFED.

32:35.503 --> 32:38.008
IT'S NOT JUST
THE SERVICE.

32:38.008 --> 32:39.553
<i>ALICIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH.</i>
THANK YOU.

32:39.553 --> 32:41.180
<i>NEXT, PLEASE?</i>

32:41.180 --> 32:43.143
I WENT THERE ONCE.
FOOD WAS SUBPAR.

32:43.143 --> 32:46.984
VERY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE
FROM WHAT I EXPECTED.

32:46.984 --> 32:48.237
EVERYBODY HAS
A BAD NIGHT.

32:48.237 --> 32:50.460
I FIGURED I'D GIVE YOU
ANOTHER CHANCE.

32:50.460 --> 32:50.658
I FIGURED I'D GIVE YOU
ANOTHER CHANCE.

32:50.658 --> 32:54.081
AND THE SECOND TIME I WENT,
IT WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.

32:54.081 --> 32:55.877
<i>OUR DINNERS</i>
<i>WERE TOTALLY WRONG.</i>

32:55.877 --> 32:58.716
MY SON ORDERED CHICKEN.
HE GOT VEAL.

32:58.716 --> 33:01.012
I THREW MY MONEY
ON MY TABLE AND SAID,

33:01.012 --> 33:04.186
"I'M DONE.
I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE."

33:04.186 --> 33:05.688
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE.

33:05.688 --> 33:06.690
<i>NEXT, PLEASE.</i>

33:06.690 --> 33:07.692
THE FOOD,

33:07.692 --> 33:10.155
EVERYTHING JUST
DID NOT WORK OUT.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.076
BUT WHAT REALLY,
REALLY STOOD IN MY MIND

33:12.076 --> 33:13.245
WAS I ORDERED A CANNOLI,

33:13.245 --> 33:16.710
AND THE CANNOLI
WAS SOUR.

33:16.710 --> 33:17.879
AND SO YOU CAME
OVER TO ME,

33:17.879 --> 33:20.050
AND YOU GAVE ME
A FRESH CANNOLI.

33:20.050 --> 33:20.460
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE ME
THE FRESH CANNOLI FIRST

33:20.460 --> 33:23.891
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU GIVE ME
THE FRESH CANNOLI FIRST

33:23.891 --> 33:25.937
RATHER THAN GIVE ME
AN OLD CANNOLI

33:25.937 --> 33:28.567
THAT LEFT A HORRID TASTE
IN MY MOUTH?

33:28.567 --> 33:29.945
<i>I MEAN, A SOUR CANNOLI,</i>
<i>I MEAN, IT--</i>

33:29.945 --> 33:31.281
IT CAN GET YOU SICK.

33:31.281 --> 33:33.452
RIGHT, BUT I WAS NOT AWARE
THAT YOU WERE GIVEN

33:33.452 --> 33:35.414
THE SOUR CANNOLI
THAT WASN'T GOOD.

33:35.414 --> 33:38.044
WELL, MAYBE THE SOUR CANNOLI
SHOULDN'T EVEN BE THERE.

33:38.044 --> 33:40.132
I WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN IT
TO YOU, YOU KNOW?

33:40.132 --> 33:41.718
BUT MY POINT IS
IS AS THE OWNER, MANAGER--

33:41.718 --> 33:44.975
WHEN THE CANNOLI CAME BACK,
AND THEN I TASTED IT,

33:44.975 --> 33:46.937
AND THEN I SAYS,
"THIS IS GOING BAD."

33:46.937 --> 33:48.274
WELL, YEAH.

33:48.274 --> 33:49.776
GONE BAD, NOT GOING.
GONE BAD.

33:49.776 --> 33:50.460
<i>IT WAS BAD.</i>
<i>ONCE IT'S GONE, IT'S GONE.</i>

33:50.460 --> 33:50.778
<i>IT WAS BAD.</i>
<i>ONCE IT'S GONE, IT'S GONE.</i>

33:50.778 --> 33:52.156
IT'S NOT COMING BACK, IS IT?

33:52.156 --> 33:53.659
RIGHT.

33:53.659 --> 33:55.162
YOU KNOW, THAT SHOULD BE GONE
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

33:55.162 --> 33:56.999
YOU KNOW, IT SHOULDN'T BE THERE.
<i>THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING.</i>

33:56.999 --> 33:59.086
LIKE, WHY EVEN SERVE SOMETHING
THAT IS QUESTIONABLE?

33:59.086 --> 34:01.090
YOU'RE RIGHT.
TOTALLY RIGHT.

34:01.090 --> 34:04.264
THAT WAS THE--
THE EXPERIENCE THAT I SAID,

34:04.264 --> 34:09.357
"I-I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER
COME BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT."

34:09.357 --> 34:11.110
WOW.

34:11.110 --> 34:13.699
TO HEAR
WHAT THEY WERE SAYING,

34:13.699 --> 34:14.910
YOU KNOW, THE REALITY,

34:14.910 --> 34:17.080
AS MUCH AS IT HURTS,
IT'S THE TRUTH.

34:17.080 --> 34:20.460
THIS FEEDBACK THIS MORNING
HAS BEEN PIVOTAL.

34:20.460 --> 34:20.630
THIS FEEDBACK THIS MORNING
HAS BEEN PIVOTAL.

34:20.630 --> 34:22.425
<i>I HOPE</i>
<i>YOU'LL ALL BE WILLING</i>

34:22.425 --> 34:25.096
<i>TO GIVE BELLA LUNA</i>
<i>ONE MORE CHANCE.</i>

34:25.096 --> 34:28.229
ON BEHALF OF THE OWNERS
AND THE TEAM,

34:28.229 --> 34:29.814
I'D LIKE TO SAY A BIG THANK-YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

34:29.814 --> 34:31.944
THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.241
I THINK EVERYTHING
HAS TO BE CHANGED,

34:34.241 --> 34:35.743
AND IF THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
TO HEAR

34:35.743 --> 34:38.207
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER
AND GET BELLA LUNA

34:38.207 --> 34:41.296
BACK ON THE MAP, I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO HEAR.

34:50.773 --> 34:52.819
CONVINCED THAT ROSARIA
AND GIANFRANCO

34:52.819 --> 34:56.033
ARE NOW FULLY AWARE THAT CHANGE
IS THEIR ONLY OPTION,

34:56.033 --> 34:59.164
CHEF RAMSAY GOES AHEAD

34:59.164 --> 35:02.170
TRANSFORMING THE DATED DECOR
OF BELLA LUNA.

35:04.133 --> 35:05.135
<i>GOOD MORNING.</i>

35:05.135 --> 35:06.680
GOOD MORNING, CHEF.

35:06.680 --> 35:10.313
WELCOME
TO THE NEW BELLA LUNA.

35:10.313 --> 35:13.402
<i>OH, MY GOD.</i>
<i>YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.</i>

35:13.402 --> 35:14.738
WOW.
DO YOU SEE THIS, MA?

35:14.738 --> 35:16.366
AMAZING.
OH, MY GOD.

35:16.366 --> 35:16.710
OH.

35:16.710 --> 35:17.577
OH.

35:17.577 --> 35:21.376
<i>HOW BRIGHT AND REFRESHING</i>

35:21.376 --> 35:22.712
<i>DOES THIS BEAUTIFUL RESTAURANT</i>
<i>LOOK?</i>

35:22.712 --> 35:23.922
<i>DO YOU LIKE IT, GIAF?</i>

35:23.922 --> 35:25.593
I LOVE IT.

35:25.593 --> 35:27.722
<i>GONE IS THAT DARK,</i>
<i>RED MAROON COLOR.</i>

35:27.722 --> 35:29.684
<i>WE'VE LIGHTENED UP</i>
<i>THE WALLS,</i>

35:29.684 --> 35:30.728
<i>THE CEILING</i>
<i>WITH THAT BEAUTIFUL GRAY.</i>

35:30.728 --> 35:32.231
OH, MY GOD.

35:32.231 --> 35:34.319
<i>GONE ARE THOSE HIDEOUS TABLES</i>
<i>IN THE MIDDLE.</i>

35:34.319 --> 35:36.782
<i>WE REPLACED THEM</i>
<i>WITH RUSTIC CENTRALIZED TABLES</i>

35:36.782 --> 35:37.825
<i>MADE FOR FAMILIES.</i>

35:37.825 --> 35:38.994
<i>IT'S GOT THAT COMMUNAL FEEL</i>
<i>AS WELL.</i>

35:38.994 --> 35:41.123
ON THE BACK WALL
THAT ENTERS TO THE KITCHEN,

35:41.123 --> 35:42.669
<i>WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT</i>
<i>OF FUN THERE</i>

35:42.669 --> 35:43.837
<i>WITH THOSE CUTTING BOARDS,</i>

35:43.837 --> 35:46.008
<i>JUST GIVE IT</i>
<i>THAT NICE RUSTIC CHARM.</i>

35:46.008 --> 35:46.710
OH, YES.

35:46.710 --> 35:47.177
OH, YES.

35:47.177 --> 35:48.847
I NEVER THOUGHT BELLA LUNA

35:48.847 --> 35:51.812
HAD ANY CHANCE
OF LOOKING THIS AMAZING.

35:51.812 --> 35:53.524
I'M STILL SPEECHLESS,
AND EVERYBODY

35:53.524 --> 35:56.238
WILL TELL YOU
I'M NEVER SPEECHLESS.

35:56.238 --> 35:57.532
WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED HERE,

35:57.532 --> 35:59.994
THIS AREA WAS
A BIT OF A DISASTER.

35:59.994 --> 36:02.709
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU
IS SOMETHING THAT IS UNIQUE.

36:02.709 --> 36:04.754
THIS WILL BE
A GAME CHANGER

36:04.754 --> 36:08.470
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOW
A STATE-OF-THE-ART,

36:08.470 --> 36:10.391
STUNNING, BRAND-NEW...

<i>IT'S GONNA TRANSFORM</i>
<i>THE BUSINESS.</i>

36:16.710 --> 36:16.820
<i>IT'S GONNA TRANSFORM</i>
<i>THE BUSINESS.</i>

36:16.820 --> 36:18.699
YOU CAN TRACK
YOUR INVENTORY.

36:18.699 --> 36:21.663
YOU CAN ADJUST YOUR COSTS,
LABOR COSTS,

36:21.663 --> 36:23.876
AND WHAT WE NEED TO HIT
ON A WEEKLY BASIS.

36:23.876 --> 36:26.548
AND TRUST ME, CHEFS,
IT'LL BE SO MUCH

36:26.548 --> 36:28.677
LESS OF A CONFUSION FOR YOU
IN THE KITCHEN.

36:28.677 --> 36:30.806
THIS THING IS GONNA BE
AN ABSOLUTE DREAM MACHINE.

36:30.806 --> 36:32.185
<i>EXCITED?</i>

36:36.860 --> 36:39.824
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
I'M STANDING IN BELLA LUNA.

36:39.824 --> 36:43.332
I FEEL LIKE A LITTLE GIRL
WHEN I WAS BACK IN SICILY.

36:43.332 --> 36:45.503
IT'S AMAZING.
I'M JUST SO THRILLED.

38:21.695 --> 38:23.615
IT'S SO GOOD.

38:23.615 --> 38:25.869
GIANFRANCO, NICOLE PUT IN
AN OSSO BUCO

38:25.869 --> 38:28.667
AND A PASTA DISH THAT
THEY'RE WAITING A LONG TIME.

38:28.667 --> 38:29.836
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I'M SORRY.

38:29.836 --> 38:31.673
- COME ON, GUYS.
- HELL.

38:31.673 --> 38:34.177
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LOOK HOW MANY
TICKETS WE HAVE BACK HERE.

38:34.177 --> 38:36.015
BUT JUST MIDWAY
INTO SERVICE,

38:36.015 --> 38:38.687
GIANFRANCO IS OVERWHELMED
WITH THE RUSH OF TICKETS...

38:38.687 --> 38:39.897
I NEED STEAMED MUSSELS.

38:39.897 --> 38:41.526
WE'RE WORKING ON IT, TRACI.

38:41.526 --> 38:44.574
AND MAINTAINING THE STANDARDS
OF THE NEW MENU.

38:44.574 --> 38:46.710
NOW, WHICH TABLE
DID SHE SAY I NEED?

38:46.710 --> 38:46.828
NOW, WHICH TABLE
DID SHE SAY I NEED?

38:46.828 --> 38:48.080
WAIT, WAIT.
COME ON!

38:48.080 --> 38:49.709
AND A RELAUNCH
THAT STARTED OFF

38:49.709 --> 38:52.214
ON A POSITIVE NOTE
IS SUDDENLY IN JEOPARDY.

38:52.214 --> 38:53.842
I'M STILL WAITING
ON TABLE SIX.

38:53.842 --> 38:55.387
HOW LONG
DO YOU THINK?

38:55.387 --> 38:56.389
IT'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE

38:56.389 --> 38:58.518
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A WELL-DONE PRIME RIB.

38:58.518 --> 38:59.854
NO, I DON'T HAVE
A WELL-DONE PRIME RIB.

38:59.854 --> 39:02.193
ALL RIGHT, SO--OKAY.

39:02.193 --> 39:06.785
COME ON, GUYS.
GET THE TABLES TOGETHER.

39:06.785 --> 39:08.872

39:08.872 --> 39:11.461
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

39:11.461 --> 39:13.715
ALL OF YOU, QUICK!

39:13.715 --> 39:15.176
<i>IF YOU THINK</i>
<i>I'M SERVING THAT,</i>

39:15.176 --> 39:16.221
YOU'RE DREAMING.

39:16.221 --> 39:16.710
WE MAY AS WELL GO BACK
TO WHERE WE WERE.

39:16.710 --> 39:17.681
WE MAY AS WELL GO BACK
TO WHERE WE WERE.

39:17.681 --> 39:18.892
ALL RIGHT.

39:18.892 --> 39:20.896
ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE'VE JUST
DROPPED OUR  STANDARDS.

39:20.896 --> 39:23.652
THE NEXT PERSON
THAT THROWS THAT OUT AT ME,

39:23.652 --> 39:24.904
I WILL THROW THEM OUT.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.241
YES, CHEF.

39:26.241 --> 39:27.409
COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S GO.

39:27.409 --> 39:29.205
COME HERE, YOU.

39:29.205 --> 39:31.166
IS THAT WHAT--IS THAT WHAT
YOU BUSTED YOUR ASS OFF FOR?

39:31.166 --> 39:32.711
NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

39:32.711 --> 39:34.465
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
COME ON.

39:34.465 --> 39:36.970
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES.

39:36.970 --> 39:38.765
GET 'EM TOGETHER.

39:49.010 --> 39:50.930
IT'S RELAUNCH NIGHT,

39:50.930 --> 39:52.893
AND GIANFRANCO'S STANDARDS
HAVE DROPPED

39:52.893 --> 39:54.688
IN THE MIDDLE OF SERVICE.

39:54.688 --> 39:57.401
IF YOU THINK I'M SERVING THAT,
YOU'RE DREAMING.

39:57.401 --> 39:59.740
AND CHEF RAMSAY
IS NOT EXACTLY PLEASED.

39:59.740 --> 40:01.661
IS THAT WHAT YOU BUSTED
YOUR ASS OFF FOR?

40:01.661 --> 40:02.913
NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

40:02.913 --> 40:04.708
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
COME ON.

40:04.708 --> 40:07.421
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES.

40:07.421 --> 40:10.929
GET 'EM TOGETHER.

40:10.929 --> 40:12.724
<i>TWO WAYS</i>
<i>A KITCHEN FUNCTIONS.</i>

40:12.724 --> 40:14.268
YOU RUN IT,
OR IT RUNS YOU.

40:14.268 --> 40:15.897
ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT.

40:15.897 --> 40:15.967
IT'S BEEN ABOUT
AN HOUR AND A HALF, RIGHT?

40:15.967 --> 40:18.110
IT'S BEEN ABOUT
AN HOUR AND A HALF, RIGHT?

40:18.110 --> 40:20.406
ONE LITTLE MISTAKE,
AND HE SINKS TO OBLIVION.

40:20.406 --> 40:22.618
GET IN THERE,
AND GET HIM LIFTED UP

40:22.618 --> 40:24.414
<i>COME ON, HONEY.</i>
<i>YOU'RE OKAY.</i>

40:24.414 --> 40:25.750
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.586
THEY LOVE THE FOOD.

40:27.586 --> 40:30.175
DON'T LET ONE LITTLE MISTAKE
KEEP YOU DOWN.

40:30.175 --> 40:32.555
I'M TRYING.
<i>OKAY, HONEY, DON'T WORRY.</i>

40:32.555 --> 40:34.642
GIANFRANCO IS UNDER A LOT
OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW...

40:34.642 --> 40:36.604
<i>YOU GUYS ARE DOING GREAT.</i>

40:36.604 --> 40:38.735
BUT HE NEEDS TO KNOW
HOW TO DEAL AND WORK

40:38.735 --> 40:40.697
WITH THE PRESSURE

40:40.697 --> 40:43.034
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,

40:43.034 --> 40:45.038
<i>WE NEED ANOTHER BRUSCHETTA.</i>

WE NEED

40:45.967 --> 40:46.709
WE NEED

40:46.709 --> 40:48.128
I NEED A PAPPARDELLE
AND OSSO BUCO RIGHT AWAY.

40:48.128 --> 40:49.255
THAT'S IT.

40:49.255 --> 40:50.884

40:50.884 --> 40:52.679
YES, WE ARE.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

SALMON, I NEED IT

40:57.563 --> 40:58.523
IT'S IN THE OVEN.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.737
RUN THAT OUT,
AND NOW I HAVE APPETIZERS READY.

41:00.737 --> 41:02.281
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

41:02.281 --> 41:03.993
THIS IS AMAZING TO ME,
TO SEE GIANFRANCO

41:03.993 --> 41:05.412
ACTUALLY GET A VOICE.

41:05.412 --> 41:07.500
THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S THE PAPPARDELLE.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.380
HOW ARE WE DOING?
HOW WAS YOUR DESSERT?
WE'RE DOING WELL.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.343
OH, IT WAS SO GOOD, REALLY GOOD.
EVERYTHING WAS REALLY GOOD.

41:16.643 --> 41:19.357
IT WAS A PLEASURE
SERVING YOU,

41:19.357 --> 41:21.695
AND WE'LL SEE YOU SOON.

41:25.703 --> 41:27.081
TONIGHT--LET'S BE HONEST--
WASN'T PERFECT,

41:27.081 --> 41:32.759
BUT WE WENT A LONG WAY
TO IMPRESSING THE LOCALS.

41:32.759 --> 41:35.932
YOUNG MAN, I FINALLY HEARD
YOUR VOICE TONIGHT,

41:35.932 --> 41:37.434
BUT IT NEEDS
TO BE THERE

41:37.434 --> 41:40.566
FROM THE BEGINNING
TO THE END.

41:40.566 --> 41:43.029
AND YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR HEAD
IN A PAN

41:43.029 --> 41:44.532
'CAUSE THIS PLACE
IS GONNA BE BUSY.

41:44.532 --> 41:45.967
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, CHEF.

41:45.967 --> 41:46.035
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, CHEF.

41:46.035 --> 41:47.371
GOOD NIGHT.

41:47.371 --> 41:48.666
TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOM, OKAY?
YES.

41:48.666 --> 41:51.672
CHEF.
OKAY, BYE-BYE, BIG MAN.

41:51.672 --> 41:53.676
THANK YOU.
DARLING, COME HERE, YOU. OH.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.684
GOD BLESS YOU.
GOOD NIGHT.

42:00.690 --> 42:02.861
WHAT A NIGHT.

42:02.861 --> 42:06.034
A MOTHER AND HER TWO SONS
MOVE FROM NEW YORK TO EASTON

42:06.034 --> 42:08.204
TO OPEN THEIR DREAM RESTAURANT
THREE YEARS AGO.

42:08.204 --> 42:09.624
BUT TRUTHFULLY,
THEY WERE NOT READY

42:09.624 --> 42:11.002
FOR SUCH A BIG CHALLENGE.

42:11.002 --> 42:14.050
BUT NOW, THEY HAVE THE ROAD MAP
ON HOW TO SUCCEED.

42:14.050 --> 42:15.887
BUT WHAT THEY REALLY NEED
MORE THAN ANYTHING

42:15.887 --> 42:15.967
IS THE DISCIPLINE
TO FOLLOW IT THROUGH.

42:15.967 --> 42:18.600
IS THE DISCIPLINE
TO FOLLOW IT THROUGH.

42:18.600 --> 42:21.564
WOW, BELLA LUNA.

42:21.564 --> 42:23.068
FINGERS CROSSED.

42:23.068 --> 42:25.072
WHAT A PLACE.

42:28.203 --> 42:29.538
IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED...

42:29.538 --> 42:31.584
WELCOME TO THE NEW
BELLA LUNA.

42:31.584 --> 42:33.505
ROSARIA TOOK
CHEF RAMSAY'S SUGGESTIONS,

42:33.505 --> 42:36.552
AND BELLA LUNA'S BUSINESS
INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.

42:36.552 --> 42:38.683
GOOD JOB, EVERYBODY.

42:38.683 --> 42:41.521
I REALLY WANT TO THANK
CHEF RAMSAY

42:41.521 --> 42:43.525
FOR CHOOSING US,
TO HELP US

42:43.525 --> 42:45.967
AND TRY TO SAVE
BELLA LUNA.

42:45.967 --> 42:46.239
AND TRY TO SAVE
BELLA LUNA.

42:46.239 --> 42:48.576
I JUST--
I FEEL SO BLESSED.

42:48.576 --> 42:50.247
<i>GRAZIE.</i>

42:50.247 --> 42:52.543
YOU GOT IT, MA.

42:52.543 --> 42:55.090
DUE TO SOME ISSUES
WITH THE LANDLORD,

42:55.090 --> 42:57.553
BELLA LUNA HAD TO CLOSE
TEMPORARILY

42:57.553 --> 43:00.100
AND IS NOW SEARCHING
FOR A NEW LOCATION.

43:00.100 --> 43:02.396
THEY HOPE TO REOPEN
VERY SOON.
