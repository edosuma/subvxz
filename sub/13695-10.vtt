WEBVTT

00:06.259 --> 00:08.970
Right, you hand me
the standard.

00:09.053 --> 00:11.681
I pass it to Ewan,
as the youngest member
of the household.

00:11.764 --> 00:14.350
Standards aren't what
they were around here.

00:14.434 --> 00:15.893
We embrace.

00:17.687 --> 00:19.772
-And you turn to Molly...
-I shall be Molly.

00:19.856 --> 00:21.733
...as the mother
of the clan, and bow.

00:21.816 --> 00:22.900
Morning, Mum.

00:24.861 --> 00:26.070
The proctor will ask
for your name.

00:26.154 --> 00:27.947
I shall be proctor. Right.

00:28.031 --> 00:30.700
He asks you your name
and he hands you
the ring of lairdship.

00:32.994 --> 00:36.205
And then you turn to receive
the acclaim of the clan.

00:36.289 --> 00:38.332
And hope they don't start
chucking things...

00:38.416 --> 00:39.917
Nobody will be
chucking anything.

00:43.254 --> 00:47.091
Paul Bowman,
the Laird MacDonald.

00:47.175 --> 00:49.469
-Doesn't quite
add up, does it?
-Add up? Add up?

00:49.552 --> 00:51.304
It's not a maths lesson,
old boy.

00:51.387 --> 00:53.556
You've served
your apprenticeship, son.

00:54.182 --> 00:56.517
You're ready.

00:56.601 --> 00:59.395
Yes, but Golly,
what role shall I have?

00:59.479 --> 01:02.774
I'm sorry, Donald, but there's
no role for the laird's uncle.
I'm sorry.

01:02.857 --> 01:06.069
Oh... Just as
at Hector's inauguration.

01:06.152 --> 01:09.989
All I got to do then was stand
around looking young,
dashing and handsome.

01:10.073 --> 01:12.115
-And all you get to do now
is stand around.
-Yes.

01:13.576 --> 01:14.869
What do you mean by that?

02:05.003 --> 02:08.339
Listen, I sent off some
samples to a few
organic retailers.

02:08.423 --> 02:10.925
Is that a good idea?
Letting them taste it?

02:11.008 --> 02:12.635
Thanks for your
vote of confidence.

02:12.719 --> 02:14.554
No, I'm just kidding.
It's a great idea.

02:14.637 --> 02:16.806
-I'm glad I thought of it.
-Ha, ha, ha...

02:16.889 --> 02:19.183
-Ow! Ah!
-Oh, my God,
are you all right?

02:19.267 --> 02:20.601
-Yeah.
-Let me see.

02:20.685 --> 02:22.645
Yeah, yeah. I'll never
play the violin again, but...

02:24.814 --> 02:27.483
Wind-up merchant!
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

02:28.985 --> 02:30.945
-Ahem!
-Oh, hi, Lucy.

02:31.029 --> 02:33.614
-I'm sorry to interrupt.
-No, we were just
talking business.

02:35.116 --> 02:37.201
-I'd better go.
I'll see you later, eh?
-Yeah.

02:44.584 --> 02:46.085
Cosy.

02:46.169 --> 02:48.171
We're business partners, Lucy.
That's all.

02:48.963 --> 02:50.506
(CAR STARTING)

02:59.223 --> 03:01.641
I thought we could go down
to London on Friday.

03:02.477 --> 03:03.978
Find a nice hotel.

03:04.062 --> 03:06.439
Catch a show, or...stay in.

03:08.399 --> 03:12.820
I'd love to, but I'm getting
inaugurated as laird
this weekend.

03:12.904 --> 03:14.197
It's kind of customary
to turn up.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.741
No, that's not this
weekend. Is it?

03:16.824 --> 03:18.618
You are coming, aren't you?

03:18.701 --> 03:20.244
I thought it was a clan thing.

03:20.328 --> 03:22.496
You know,
family and close friends only.

03:23.956 --> 03:25.624
That's why I want you there.

03:25.708 --> 03:27.627
Then I'd be honoured. Thanks.

03:40.848 --> 03:42.809
Home, sweet home.

03:43.476 --> 03:45.186
I suppose.

03:48.022 --> 03:49.482
Molly!

03:49.565 --> 03:51.317
-You're back!
-Yes.

03:53.194 --> 03:54.737
Why didn't you call?
We could have
picked you up.

03:54.820 --> 03:57.448
Don't be silly. If I can make
it to New Zealand and back,

03:57.532 --> 03:59.617
I can certainly manage
a trip from the station.

03:59.701 --> 04:01.244
I was worried you
wouldn't make it in time.

04:01.327 --> 04:03.161
-For your inauguration?
-Aye.

04:03.246 --> 04:06.040
I am the mother of the clan.
I have to be there.

04:06.124 --> 04:11.462
-Anyway, I went a bit mad,
got everybody presents.
-And new cases as well.

04:11.546 --> 04:14.298
-I'm sorry?
-New suitcases.

04:14.382 --> 04:16.050
I mean, these aren't
the ones you left with.

04:16.134 --> 04:18.177
But I have a set
just like these.

04:18.261 --> 04:20.512
Aye. But they're
still upstair...

04:22.724 --> 04:24.015
Are you sure about that?

04:27.186 --> 04:28.730
Unless those are Molly's.

04:32.233 --> 04:35.194
Everything's gone! My clothes!
My mementos!

04:37.071 --> 04:38.197
Can I ask what my present was?

04:38.614 --> 04:40.742
Ow!

04:40.825 --> 04:43.578
A photograph of me and Jamie
by the loch.
I take it with me everywhere.

04:45.955 --> 04:47.874
(SIGHING)

04:47.957 --> 04:50.626
-You all right there, Donald?
-I could use a glass
of something.

04:50.710 --> 04:52.837
Only, you seem to be going
through my papers.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.839
I had no idea your job
was so boring.

04:54.922 --> 04:56.758
What's feudal duty exactly?

04:57.925 --> 05:00.261
It's an ancient tax
on the tenants.

05:00.345 --> 05:02.764
In theory, they're still
the vassals of the laird

05:02.847 --> 05:05.516
and they're supposed
to pay me for the privilege
of not working my land

05:05.600 --> 05:07.393
and fighting my wars.

05:07.477 --> 05:09.562
Really? How much?

05:10.480 --> 05:11.773
I don't enforce it.

05:11.856 --> 05:14.609
Look, I'm all in favour of
upholding traditions,

05:14.692 --> 05:16.861
but crucifying tenants
isn't one of them.

05:16.944 --> 05:22.575
Actually, crucifixion was
rarely the punishment
for defaulting tenants.

05:22.658 --> 05:27.872
More often it was flogging,
branding or merely
a week in the stocks.

05:27.955 --> 05:31.376
Proctor Sheila MacDonald
of the Clan MacDonald.

05:31.459 --> 05:34.712
Oh, my dear lady.
Donald MacDonald.

05:34.796 --> 05:36.881
-Delighted.
-Ah, yes,

05:36.964 --> 05:38.383
the prodigal uncle.

05:38.466 --> 05:41.511
(LAUGHING)
And this is my nephew,
Paul, the new laird.

05:41.594 --> 05:43.304
You're very welcome here,
Proctor.

05:43.388 --> 05:44.430
Thank you.

05:45.223 --> 05:46.724
Oh!

05:46.808 --> 05:50.311
Glenbogle is such a
magnificent edifice.

05:50.395 --> 05:52.980
It reverberates with history.

05:53.064 --> 05:54.941
Would you care
for a drink, Proctor?

05:55.024 --> 05:57.318
-Would you have a mead?
-Mead?

05:59.779 --> 06:02.198
Ah, sorry, I think it's
the bees' day off,

06:02.281 --> 06:04.992
-but I'll just
check the garden.
-A sherry will be fine.

06:06.369 --> 06:08.413
So...

06:08.496 --> 06:11.290
You're renouncing
the feudal duty.

06:11.374 --> 06:13.084
Such a shame.

06:13.167 --> 06:16.587
One more link in our
ancient clan heritage lost.

06:16.671 --> 06:19.215
Well, maybe I should
reintroduce the Highland
clearances as well.

06:19.298 --> 06:22.927
-Evict all the tenants and
replace them with sheep.
-Oh.

06:23.011 --> 06:26.347
Dear lady, you're a little
early for the inauguration.

06:26.431 --> 06:29.308
I thought we were doing it
on Saturday.

06:29.392 --> 06:35.440
I just need to see that
everything is in order and
to verify the deeds of title.

06:35.523 --> 06:38.985
-Can I show you to your room,
Proctor?
-Thank you.

06:39.068 --> 06:42.238
It has a photograph of my son
in one of the cases.

06:42.321 --> 06:43.948
It's irreplaceable!

06:45.491 --> 06:48.536
No, I understand.

06:50.329 --> 06:52.582
Thank you.

06:52.665 --> 06:55.209
Molly, this is the
clan proctor,

06:55.292 --> 06:57.003
Sheila MacDonald.
Molly MacDonald.

06:57.086 --> 07:00.757
Ah, yes, the Dowager
Queen of Glenbogle.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.843
Not really. Well, you make me
sound like the power
behind the throne.

07:03.926 --> 07:08.389
Oh, no, of course not.
Paul's not your
natural son, is he?

07:08.473 --> 07:13.186
In fact, with his accession,
your bloodline
will effectively be extinct.

07:13.269 --> 07:15.229
How concisely you put it.

07:15.313 --> 07:16.564
If you'll excuse me a moment.

07:18.483 --> 07:23.529
Goodness, is that
the 23rd Laird of Glenbogle?

07:26.282 --> 07:28.951
(INDISTINCT MUMBLING)

07:29.035 --> 07:31.954
(STRAINS) Ugh!
What have you got
in here?

07:32.038 --> 07:33.373
Oh, you know...

07:33.456 --> 07:36.334
-washing up liquid and...
-Oh, yeah,

07:36.417 --> 07:39.128
That'll clean a lot of pots
and pans and I don't think.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.467
When I was your age,
we used to make our own hooch.

07:44.550 --> 07:48.680
Right, I'm off to MacDougal's
to see if they've got
that book of poetry I ordered.

07:48.763 --> 07:52.433
Oh, no, I'll go. Let me.
You go home
and put your feet up.

07:52.517 --> 07:54.726
Tut, tut, tut.
You got your eye on some man?

07:55.645 --> 07:58.231
-Huh?
-No. Dad!

07:58.314 --> 08:00.108
Well, don't forget that book.

08:00.191 --> 08:02.193
-What?
-The poetry book.

08:02.276 --> 08:05.488
-Right, no,
I won't forget that.
-Okay.

08:05.571 --> 08:06.656
-Okay.
-See you later.

08:06.739 --> 08:08.658
-See you.
-(CAR STARTING)

08:21.087 --> 08:23.381
-Jess! Hi.
-Hi!

08:23.464 --> 08:27.135
-What are you doing here?
-Trying to find a hairdresser
who doesn't use sheep shears.

08:27.218 --> 08:30.179
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, I meant in Glenbogle.

08:30.263 --> 08:31.556
Well, I'm here
to see your dad.

08:31.639 --> 08:34.600
-Meg...
-Look, I know I left a bit,

08:34.683 --> 08:38.270
well, a bit abruptly,
but I'm back now.

08:38.354 --> 08:40.148
You don't understand.

08:40.231 --> 08:43.359
He went to pieces
when you left.
He's still in pieces.

08:43.443 --> 08:45.862
That's why I came back.
To fix things.

08:47.196 --> 08:49.032
You can't.

08:49.115 --> 08:52.035
I don't think anyone can.

08:52.118 --> 08:54.703
I'm sorry, Meg,
but he doesn't
want to see you.

08:59.374 --> 09:00.959
The ring of Lairdship.

09:01.377 --> 09:02.962
Oh!

09:03.045 --> 09:06.007
-You don't wear it?
-I can never find
the wellies to match.

09:06.424 --> 09:07.425
Oh!

09:11.471 --> 09:13.264
The clan proctor's a woman.

09:13.348 --> 09:14.640
I know, it's terrible,
isn't it?

09:14.724 --> 09:16.142
They'll be letting
them wear trousers next.

09:16.225 --> 09:19.520
Well, everything
appears to be in order.

09:19.604 --> 09:22.607
The Deed of Secession,
certificates of birth.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.944
-You're still called Bowman?
-That's my name.

09:27.028 --> 09:30.239
It's unusual for the laird
not to be a MacDonald,

09:30.323 --> 09:33.951
but it should have no bearing
on your eventual
claim to the title.

09:35.286 --> 09:37.538
Eventual?
How do you mean, eventual?

09:37.622 --> 09:39.957
This is the fascinating part.

09:40.041 --> 09:43.461
Now, according to
these clan statutes,

09:43.544 --> 09:49.217
the line of primacy leads to
the surviving legitimate male.

09:49.300 --> 09:53.846
Thus, it is not you,
but Donald,
who is the rightful laird.

09:54.806 --> 09:57.892
(BOTH LAUGHING)

10:01.979 --> 10:06.234
-Donald? Away!
-No, I am perfectly serious.

10:06.317 --> 10:09.320
In cases of pre-mortality
secession,

10:09.404 --> 10:13.157
the legitimate descendants
have prior claim.

10:13.241 --> 10:16.703
Indeed, Donald should have
been laird this past year.

10:16.786 --> 10:20.998
-She is serious.
-The precedent
was set in 1735.

10:21.082 --> 10:22.959
Never mind the precedent.

10:23.042 --> 10:25.336
Donald cannot be the laird.

10:25.420 --> 10:27.130
He doesn't even
want to be laird.
Do you, Donald?

10:28.631 --> 10:30.425
Hold on, hold on.

10:30.508 --> 10:32.885
You're saying I've jumped
through all these
frilly tartan hoops

10:32.969 --> 10:36.014
to become the laird
and I don't...

10:36.097 --> 10:38.016
I don't even qualify
because I'm illegitimate?

10:38.099 --> 10:42.103
You do qualify but Donald's
claim is the stronger.

10:42.186 --> 10:44.147
-Good Lord!
-I don't believe this.

10:44.230 --> 10:45.982
Donald, you can't be serious.

10:46.065 --> 10:50.445
Golly, who am I to turn back
the tide of destiny?

10:52.947 --> 10:56.117
Oh, dear, another family feud.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.578
They seem to spring up
wherever I go.

11:00.621 --> 11:02.623
How's Donald going to manage?

11:02.707 --> 11:05.209
There's more to being laird
than fast cars, rubber cheques
and posh totty.

11:05.293 --> 11:07.003
I know, I know.

11:08.713 --> 11:12.383
But it's Paul
I'm worried about.

11:12.467 --> 11:16.012
-What can we do?
-Uphold the tradition of staff
throughout the centuries.

11:17.221 --> 11:19.223
Follow whoever pays the wages.

11:38.868 --> 11:39.911
Golly!

11:43.039 --> 11:44.040
Golly.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.543
I don't know what
you want me to do.

11:47.627 --> 11:49.796
Talk to the proctor.
Or some other clan elders.

11:49.879 --> 11:51.631
You're the only one with
enough clout to
make them listen.

11:51.714 --> 11:54.509
I'm sorry, Paul, I can't.

11:54.592 --> 11:56.636
-Molly?
-Well, they're all gone,

11:56.719 --> 12:00.598
my real family,
and now I've lost
all my things.

12:00.682 --> 12:02.767
Oof! Maybe I'm better
off without them.

12:02.850 --> 12:05.812
But Donald can't be laird.
He thinks the whole
business is a joke.

12:05.895 --> 12:09.482
On the contrary, dear boy,
I'm quite ready
to accept my destiny.

12:09.565 --> 12:11.776
Your destiny? It was mine
until five minutes ago.

12:11.859 --> 12:14.570
Really, Paul, if you won't
accept ancient traditions,

12:14.654 --> 12:16.072
maybe you're not
the Bowman for the job.

12:16.155 --> 12:18.908
Oh, please, stop this,
both of you.

12:18.991 --> 12:21.577
What do I have to do
to prove myself, Molly?

12:21.661 --> 12:23.663
I just want to be
left out of this.

12:25.665 --> 12:27.625
There's nothing
I can do, is there?

12:30.003 --> 12:31.170
I'll never be a MacDonald.

12:33.047 --> 12:35.258
I understand, Molly,
it's a difficult decision.

12:35.341 --> 12:39.012
No, you don't understand.
It has nothing to do
with me any more, any of it.

12:42.682 --> 12:44.892
-You mean he isn't gonna
be laird?
-CHESTER: No.

12:44.976 --> 12:46.561
When was he going to tell me?

12:46.644 --> 12:48.646
Maybe he doesn't
believe it himself.

12:50.106 --> 12:51.774
I bet he's told Isobel.

12:51.858 --> 12:57.572
Ah, yes, now, if Isobel does
fancy her chances with him,

12:57.655 --> 12:59.574
maybe it's as well he's not
going to be laird.

13:00.408 --> 13:02.326
-How so?
-Oh, Lucy!

13:02.410 --> 13:04.203
He's been sacked.

13:04.287 --> 13:06.706
Last thing he's gonna do
is sit around here
moping about it.

13:06.789 --> 13:08.207
-You mean he'll leave?
-Yes...

13:08.916 --> 13:10.626
Taking you with him.

13:10.710 --> 13:13.004
-Leaving...
-Leaving Isobel here,
far behind.

13:13.087 --> 13:15.423
With only dear old
Chester to turn to.

13:15.506 --> 13:17.759
It's gonna be hard but...

13:17.842 --> 13:20.178
-I'll do my best
to console her.
-Yeah, I bet you will.

13:20.261 --> 13:22.221
Not every cloud
has a silver lining.

13:23.514 --> 13:25.099
Some have platinum.

13:25.183 --> 13:26.184
(LAUGHING)

13:28.895 --> 13:31.564
Are you sure about this?

13:31.647 --> 13:33.858
It's a bit short on amenities,
is it not?

13:33.941 --> 13:39.280
Fresh air, sunshine, peace.
What other amenities
do I need?

13:39.364 --> 13:42.075
I know. Are you not worried
about your heart?

13:42.658 --> 13:43.951
Yes.

13:44.869 --> 13:46.371
Yes. That's why I'm here.

13:54.003 --> 13:56.172
Molly, I don't understand.

13:56.255 --> 14:00.259
Everyone wants me to sort out
their problems and I can't.

14:00.343 --> 14:04.430
Oh, Golly, my family's
scattered and...

14:04.514 --> 14:07.517
Everything just seems
to bring more pain.

14:08.810 --> 14:10.019
I know what you mean.

14:12.605 --> 14:16.943
"Laird's Choice." Yes.

14:17.026 --> 14:19.445
-Which laird is that?
-Paul suggested it.

14:19.529 --> 14:21.030
Ah, the young pretender.

14:22.824 --> 14:26.327
Anyway, turns out he should
have signed this while
he was at it.

14:27.412 --> 14:29.747
It's only a formality.

14:29.831 --> 14:32.875
Apparently, I need the laird's
permission to run the business
from my farm.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.503
Ah, do you really?

14:36.879 --> 14:38.339
Donald, there's no catch.

14:38.423 --> 14:40.466
And it will bring in jobs
and money to the community.

14:40.550 --> 14:43.177
-Some sort of profit sharing
arrangement, is it?
-Not as such.

14:43.261 --> 14:45.138
Perhaps it should
be...as such.

14:45.221 --> 14:46.472
Who would I be sharing
my profits with?

14:46.556 --> 14:49.517
-Well, me of course. Say 20%.
-20%!

14:49.600 --> 14:51.185
In return for my seal.

14:51.269 --> 14:53.563
Of course, a flat fee would
save on the paperwork.

14:53.646 --> 14:56.274
How about 5 grand a year?

14:56.357 --> 14:58.943
And how about you get stuffed?

14:59.027 --> 15:00.611
This is extortion!

15:00.695 --> 15:02.530
My dear girl.
You're addressing the laird.

15:02.613 --> 15:05.074
Oh, well, pardon me.

15:05.158 --> 15:07.702
How about you get stuffed,
Your Lairdship!

15:21.049 --> 15:23.676
(DOOR SLAMMING)

15:23.760 --> 15:27.180
I know it's a bit of a blow
but it might turn out
for the best.

15:27.263 --> 15:32.060
I mean, what with your looks
and my brains, we could go
anywhere, do anything.

15:32.143 --> 15:35.146
We? What do you think
Chester would say about that?

15:35.229 --> 15:37.899
Chester can always find
someone else. I won't.

15:40.068 --> 15:42.028
What's up?

15:42.111 --> 15:45.281
Our new laird and master wants
a share of our profits.
That's what's up.

15:45.365 --> 15:49.369
-This must be a wind-up.
-Oh, yeah, I'm laughing so
much I'm splitting my sides.

15:49.452 --> 15:52.080
Why don't you just
set up shop somewhere else?

15:52.163 --> 15:53.623
And let him get
away with this?

15:58.002 --> 15:59.671
Okay, I'll talk to him.

16:05.968 --> 16:08.388
You can't do this, Donald.
It's a disincentive.

16:08.471 --> 16:11.307
You want to encourage people
like Isobel. Not punish them.

16:11.391 --> 16:13.851
I'm not punishing her,
dear boy,

16:13.935 --> 16:17.897
but if the laird doesn't
enforce his rights,
he may as well not exist.

16:17.980 --> 16:21.526
-But you can't tax
your tenants' businesses.
-If I can't, who can?

16:21.609 --> 16:26.531
Yes, if you were laird,
things might be different.

16:26.614 --> 16:28.825
But you're not laird, are you?
Hmm?

16:54.684 --> 16:57.478
-Hello.
-All right.

16:57.562 --> 17:01.232
Now, this way, you can't
drive off without a word.

17:01.315 --> 17:04.652
-Like yesterday.
-Not that you'd ever do
anything like that, of course.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.448
I was scared.

17:10.324 --> 17:12.535
I just wanted time
to work things out.

17:12.617 --> 17:15.663
Oh, right, it's an "I need
my own space" sort of thing.

17:17.373 --> 17:20.251
Well, I had no idea you were
so keen to get rid of me.

17:20.335 --> 17:22.045
You can believe that
if you like.

17:23.546 --> 17:24.964
Why did you come back?

17:31.554 --> 17:33.306
I've lost my passport.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.684
Can't travel without it,

17:36.768 --> 17:38.936
and it takes six weeks
to get a new one.

17:39.020 --> 17:41.189
I haven't seen it. Sorry.

17:41.272 --> 17:45.026
Right. Well, I'll keep
on looking.

17:45.108 --> 17:46.611
Yeah, me too.

17:52.365 --> 17:54.743
-Goodbye, Golly.
-Bye.

18:09.091 --> 18:11.302
Hey, boss.

18:11.386 --> 18:12.804
Not any more.

18:12.887 --> 18:16.265
Oh, right, yeah.
I forgot. You quit.

18:16.349 --> 18:18.976
I never quit.
I wasn't appointed.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.896
Yes, they told you that
and you just rolled over.

18:24.857 --> 18:28.319
-What was I supposed to do?
-Stand up for yourself, Paul.

18:28.403 --> 18:31.155
And for all of us.

18:31.239 --> 18:34.742
It came this morning.
Every tenant on
the estate got one.

18:51.009 --> 18:54.220
Ah, Paul, we've had a
bit of a makeover.
Do you like it?

18:54.303 --> 18:56.556
What the hell is this, Donald?
Feudal duty!

18:56.639 --> 19:00.101
You seriously want your
tenants to pay you for not
working your land?

19:00.184 --> 19:03.187
According to ancient custom.
It's only a token amount.

19:03.271 --> 19:05.857
Backdated 10 years.
People can't afford this.

19:05.940 --> 19:10.570
I can't be blamed if certain
former incumbents
neglected to collect it.

19:10.653 --> 19:13.740
This lord and vassals stuff
is ludicrous. It's obsolete.

19:13.823 --> 19:19.245
On the contrary! It's the very
cornerstone of lairdship,
a cherished link to the past.

19:20.747 --> 19:23.416
I'm sure the peasants
will be delighted to pay it.

19:23.499 --> 19:26.377
Oh, keep this up, Donald,
and the peasants will
form a co-op

19:26.461 --> 19:29.297
and buy the land out
from under you. Then you'll be
laird of naff all.

19:29.380 --> 19:32.425
I'm not worried by
that rabble. Hah!

19:32.508 --> 19:33.634
Who'll lead them?

19:35.887 --> 19:38.014
-Maybe I will.
-Oh...

19:38.097 --> 19:41.100
You're coming close
to treason, dear boy.

19:41.184 --> 19:42.935
Well, let's come a bit closer,
shall we!

19:43.019 --> 19:45.772
You're so keen on ancient
traditions, try this one.

19:45.855 --> 19:47.815
You are not fit to be laird.

19:48.524 --> 19:49.567
Argh!

19:50.943 --> 19:54.655
You dare challenge me
for the title?

19:55.615 --> 19:57.325
Very well!

19:57.408 --> 19:59.744
Oh, for God's sake, Donald.

19:59.827 --> 20:02.997
I'm warning you,
I have experience.

20:03.081 --> 20:05.917
I'm warning you!
I have experience.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.544
-Yeah, well, so do I.
-Oh!

20:08.628 --> 20:11.589
All right, then, we'll get the
proctor. We'll get
the proctor back.

20:11.673 --> 20:14.050
She can administer
the laird's challenge.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.052
If she deems you worthy.

20:16.135 --> 20:18.304
The laird's challenge?

20:18.388 --> 20:21.557
You seriously think I'm gonna
settle this with some
haggis tossing contest?

20:21.641 --> 20:25.311
The challenged party
chooses the battlefield

20:25.395 --> 20:29.691
and the clan proctor won't
settle for anything less!

20:32.276 --> 20:33.861
Fine. Fine.

20:34.779 --> 20:35.780
Bring it on.

20:41.577 --> 20:42.578
Oh!

20:44.372 --> 20:45.915
What do I do with this?

20:45.998 --> 20:47.917
Oh, slice me some porridge.

20:48.001 --> 20:50.837
I need all of my strength
for the trials ahead.

20:52.630 --> 20:54.340
So far, so good. Hmm.

21:00.138 --> 21:03.975
Sorry to do this to you,
making you choose between
me and Donald.

21:04.058 --> 21:07.145
Listen, Paul, I respect
tradition, I don't idolise it.

21:07.228 --> 21:08.771
That's what gets
people into trouble.

21:09.897 --> 21:10.898
Come on.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.405
It's very kind of you
to put me up.

21:17.488 --> 21:19.449
Sheila, you're very welcome.

21:19.532 --> 21:24.037
In disputes like these,
it's best if the umpire
resides on neutral territory.

21:25.872 --> 21:27.331
Well, just what
the place needs

21:27.415 --> 21:29.292
-is a good civil war.
-Mead, isn't it?

21:29.375 --> 21:30.460
Mmm!

21:30.543 --> 21:32.086
-Cheers.
-Mmm. Cheers.

21:34.922 --> 21:37.717
-Mmm, excellent.
-Please.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.803
So, just between us, who do
you fancy for the title, then?

21:40.887 --> 21:43.723
No, I mustn't speculate.

21:43.806 --> 21:47.602
Would you believe,
some people bet on the outcome
of these contests.

21:47.685 --> 21:49.395
How very cynical.

21:49.479 --> 21:52.398
Traditionally there have
always been three tests.

21:52.482 --> 21:55.902
-Fitness, wisdom
and leadership.
-Ha, ha, ha!

21:55.985 --> 22:00.573
Well, Donald doesn't stand a
chance, then, does he? Without
a bit of divine intervention.

22:00.656 --> 22:05.620
Oh, now, the best laid schemes
of mice and men
gang aft a-gley.

22:05.703 --> 22:08.039
-Is that right?
-The test of wisdom

22:08.122 --> 22:12.960
is a quiz on clan history,
set by myself, of course.

22:13.044 --> 22:15.755
Oh, well, we'd better put that
somewhere safe, then,
hadn't we?

22:15.838 --> 22:16.881
Good.

22:17.965 --> 22:19.676
Little top-up, Sheila?

22:19.759 --> 22:21.636
Oh, no, I shouldn't.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.348
-Oh, why not?
-Ha, ha, ha!

22:25.431 --> 22:27.058
Ooh, ooh.

22:27.141 --> 22:28.851
Mmm, smells good.

22:28.935 --> 22:31.270
Venison. Don't tell the laird.

23:02.051 --> 23:03.761
It's not insider trading,
Luce.

of what you've got.

-Oh, Shirley, yes,
he does rather blend

23:28.870 --> 23:31.164
into the woodwork. Shirley,
this is my cook, Ewan.

23:32.790 --> 23:34.917
-Your name's Shirley?
-Is there a problem?

23:35.001 --> 23:36.544
No, no, no,
pleased to meet you.

23:36.627 --> 23:39.714
Shirley and I met years ago
when he was working in Japan.

23:39.797 --> 23:42.967
Got into bother with
a yakuza betting syndicate.

23:43.051 --> 23:44.635
And I smuggled him out.

23:44.719 --> 23:46.387
Must have been
some size of suitcase.

23:46.471 --> 23:49.057
-I'm here to repay the favour.
-Very loyal of you.

23:49.140 --> 23:50.641
Least I could do.

23:50.725 --> 23:54.812
-One thing I won't tolerate,
it's disloyalty.

I are going to survey

for the lairdship.
-Mmm-hmm.

24:15.208 --> 24:18.378
If you turned up to
support Paul,
it would mean a lot.

than just your bloodline.

with people bring pain,

24:42.318 --> 24:44.153
the love they bring you...

24:45.655 --> 24:47.156
...makes you richer.

24:48.658 --> 24:50.326

be grateful for that.

doing here?

When I asked you to sort
out the lease with Donald,

25:37.081 --> 25:39.083
I didn't expect you
to lead a rebellion.

25:39.167 --> 25:41.502
When I'm laird again,
I will sort it out.

27:09.340 --> 27:11.426
Lost it, lost it, lost it.

27:11.509 --> 27:14.637
I declare Donald MacDonald
is the winner!

27:16.139 --> 27:18.307
No, no, you can't
let that stand.

27:18.391 --> 27:20.268
Paul's track was waterlogged.

27:20.351 --> 27:24.230
I'm sorry. The ground was
the same for both competitors.

27:24.313 --> 27:25.982
Pleasure doing business.

27:26.065 --> 27:29.360
-Is there anything I can
get you, Shirley?
-Some oxygen, perhaps?

27:29.444 --> 27:31.070
Right, out of here. Come on.

27:34.407 --> 27:35.992
Easy, girl.

27:36.075 --> 27:40.455
Plenty of time to cheer him up
when this is all over.

27:40.538 --> 27:44.709
-Thank you, gents.
-I'm quite exhausted after all
that effort. Gentlemen!

27:47.003 --> 27:48.713
Gentlemen?

27:51.007 --> 27:53.051
You know, your pal was lucky.

27:53.134 --> 27:55.511
If Paul hadn't hit that patch
of bog...

27:55.595 --> 27:58.514
No such thing as luck,
dear boy,

27:58.598 --> 28:01.434
merely divine providence.

28:01.517 --> 28:02.852
What were those
water tanks for?

28:02.935 --> 28:04.604
In case I get thirsty.

28:10.360 --> 28:11.778
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

28:11.861 --> 28:13.196
ISOBEL: Hello?

28:13.905 --> 28:15.073
Whoo-oo!

28:18.493 --> 28:20.620
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

28:21.496 --> 28:22.955
So, need a hand?

28:23.039 --> 28:26.751
-Cramming? Exam technique?
-What did you have in mind?

28:26.834 --> 28:29.962
Well, I thought I could
write the answers really small
on the cuff of your shirt.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.757
No, you're okay,
I've got help.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.133
Ah, right, course. Lucy, yeah.

28:34.217 --> 28:36.386
Actually, I don't know
where Lucy is.

28:36.469 --> 28:40.515
Really? Doesn't she know
how much this means to you?

28:40.598 --> 28:44.310
Yeah, but how come it
means so much to you?

28:44.394 --> 28:47.647
Because Donald'll
cost me a fortune.

28:47.730 --> 28:50.525
And I don't want to
lose a business partner.

28:50.608 --> 28:52.485
Yeah, yeah, course.

28:53.444 --> 28:55.029
And I don't want to lose you.

28:58.616 --> 29:00.326
Isobel.

29:00.410 --> 29:02.120
-Hey.
-Fancy some tea?

29:02.203 --> 29:03.663
Tell you what, I'll sort it.

29:03.746 --> 29:06.541
You just beat some learning
into the laird here.

29:06.624 --> 29:08.751
Oh, wouldn't worry about him.

29:08.835 --> 29:13.131
What Donald knows about
clan history you could tattoo
on a midge's nipple.

29:13.214 --> 29:14.465
(TITTERS)

29:17.468 --> 29:19.303
I need to see Donald.

29:19.387 --> 29:21.180
He's there.

29:24.475 --> 29:26.602
Thank you, Ewan.

29:32.859 --> 29:36.195
Memorise this
and then burn it.

29:36.279 --> 29:38.865
The questions for
the quiz tomorrow.

29:38.948 --> 29:42.243
-Don't tell me you
disapprove of cheating.
-The laird makes the law.

29:42.326 --> 29:45.788
The laird cannot cheat,
ipso facto.

29:45.872 --> 29:47.749
But I confess...

29:47.832 --> 29:50.668
I am touched by this
unexpected show of devotion.

29:50.752 --> 29:53.087
-I have my reasons, okay?
-How can I ever repay you?

29:53.171 --> 29:55.798
A suitcase full of used fivers
or marriage perhaps.

29:55.882 --> 29:59.177
I need an heir
and you're quite presentable.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.137
-I'm spoken for.
-Ah.

30:02.388 --> 30:04.724
Paul's a very lucky man.

30:10.855 --> 30:13.858
-What did she want?
-Ohhh...

30:15.151 --> 30:18.863
-(KNOCK AT DOOR)
-Yeah?

30:25.119 --> 30:26.788
Hello.

30:27.372 --> 30:28.373
Hi.

30:29.916 --> 30:31.209
Are you all right?

30:31.292 --> 30:35.546
Aye, it's a...
Must be just a
tummy bug or something.

30:39.050 --> 30:40.677
-Sorry.
-Oh!

30:40.760 --> 30:42.637
It was in the house
all the time.

30:44.055 --> 30:45.098
Thanks.

30:47.183 --> 30:48.393
Listen, I know that...

30:49.268 --> 30:51.562
Well, like I said before, I...

30:51.646 --> 30:56.651
I know that I interfered
back then, but I was only
trying to help.

30:56.734 --> 30:59.987
I just... I just wanted you
to be happy.

31:00.988 --> 31:02.532
I still do.

31:05.618 --> 31:07.620
Whatever you do,
wherever you go...

31:09.997 --> 31:13.418
You're a free spirit, Meg.

31:13.501 --> 31:16.629
That was what
I liked about you.

31:16.713 --> 31:19.549
-That's all?
-(SIGHS)

31:23.469 --> 31:25.763
Anyway, I...

31:27.265 --> 31:32.979
I hope that
the stupid things I said...

31:33.062 --> 31:35.273
Don't spoil your memories.

31:37.025 --> 31:38.651
Yeah, well, I hope so, too.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.614
So...

31:46.993 --> 31:48.995
What?

31:51.497 --> 31:53.541
Have a safe journey, lass.

31:55.418 --> 31:57.253
And a happy life.

31:59.255 --> 32:01.132
Yeah.

32:01.841 --> 32:03.217
You, too.

32:04.427 --> 32:06.054
Aye.

32:11.142 --> 32:16.272
What nickname was given
to Rory MacDonald when
he became laird?

32:16.356 --> 32:21.027
-Rory of the Silver Arm.
-And in which year
did he succeed?

32:22.612 --> 32:23.696
Er...

32:23.780 --> 32:25.114
1560?

32:25.907 --> 32:28.117
I think it was 1566.

32:28.201 --> 32:32.872
-It was 1566.
-(APPLAUSE)

32:32.955 --> 32:35.416
How's he doing this?

32:35.500 --> 32:37.919
Donald is seven points
in the lead.

32:38.002 --> 32:44.258
If he answers
the next question correctly,
the contest is over.

32:44.342 --> 32:50.598
What emblem did
Hugh MacDonald adopt at
the Battle of the Dry Ford?

32:54.185 --> 32:57.021
Was it the eagle
holding a thistle?

32:57.105 --> 32:58.481
It was!

33:04.487 --> 33:06.823
That was a very lucky guess.

33:06.906 --> 33:09.992
This contest is concluded.

33:10.076 --> 33:15.873
I declare Donald the laird
with no further contest.

33:15.957 --> 33:21.546
Thank you. And I invite one
and all to a ball in the hall
tonight here in the castle.

33:21.629 --> 33:24.382
And shall we say a tenner each
for the kitty?

33:24.465 --> 33:26.884
-(CROWD GROANS)
-Thank you.

33:31.014 --> 33:33.016
I don't believe this.

33:33.975 --> 33:35.184
I've let everyone down.

33:36.102 --> 33:37.812
This is not right.

33:37.895 --> 33:41.524
I'm sorry, Paul, but...
You did your best.

33:42.150 --> 33:43.860
Yeah.

33:45.278 --> 33:46.279
And it wasn't good enough.

33:49.574 --> 33:52.660
I know you're upset,
but it'll be okay.

34:14.264 --> 34:15.683
Molly?

34:15.766 --> 34:19.270
Oh, Meg! What are
you doing here?

34:19.353 --> 34:21.188
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

34:21.272 --> 34:23.315
Well, I lost my cases, and...

34:23.399 --> 34:26.652
Oh, never mind.
Does Golly know you're back?

34:26.735 --> 34:29.072
Oh, yes, he knows.

34:30.156 --> 34:31.574
What's wrong?

34:32.283 --> 34:35.119
Everything. (SOBS)

34:35.203 --> 34:38.956
Molly, I... I know
you two are close.

34:39.040 --> 34:41.333
Could you give him
a message for me?

34:41.417 --> 34:42.710
You're not leaving again?

34:42.793 --> 34:44.754
Oh, I don't know.

34:44.837 --> 34:47.130
I think I might have to.

34:47.215 --> 34:49.425
It's all changed now.
I just...

34:49.509 --> 34:55.223
Meg, when you and Golly were
together, he was the happiest
I've ever seen him.

34:55.306 --> 34:57.392
Yes, he's proud
and he's stubborn...

34:57.475 --> 35:01.270
-Yeah, me, too.
-Well, if you know that,
what's the problem?

35:01.354 --> 35:02.980
Oh, Molly.

35:04.649 --> 35:06.359
I'm pregnant.

35:08.611 --> 35:13.282
Oh! Well... That's wonderful.

35:13.366 --> 35:15.201
But you can't leave now,
not like this.

35:15.284 --> 35:17.245
No, but I can't stay either.

35:17.328 --> 35:21.332
-But you must tell him.
-No, no, no, no.

35:21.416 --> 35:26.587
It's over between us and
I don't want him to take
me back because of the baby.

35:26.671 --> 35:29.382
I mean, that just wouldn't
be fair on either of us.

35:29.465 --> 35:32.343
Listen, you must not tell him
I'm pregnant.

35:32.427 --> 35:34.761
-You promise me?
-(WHISPERS) I promise.

35:34.846 --> 35:36.472
Just...

35:38.099 --> 35:40.560
Just tell him he was right.

35:40.643 --> 35:43.521
That what we had was wonderful

35:43.603 --> 35:46.690
and that nothing
he could ever say

35:46.773 --> 35:49.027
could spoil my memories of it.

35:51.320 --> 35:52.655
That's it.

35:53.448 --> 35:55.031
Thanks, Molly.

36:12.133 --> 36:13.718
-Proctor!
-Oh!

36:13.800 --> 36:17.221
Sorry, didn't mean
to scare you.

36:17.305 --> 36:20.975
Look, there's something
you should know.

36:21.059 --> 36:24.062
-25 inches.
-Oh, good,
it'll have to be nine carat.

36:24.145 --> 36:28.524
I demand to see
Donald MacDonald!

36:28.608 --> 36:30.443
Is it inauguration time
already?

36:30.526 --> 36:34.489
I have reason to believe
there was cheating
during the laird's challenge.

36:34.572 --> 36:37.075
You know, I never did trust
that nephew of mine.

36:37.158 --> 36:39.452
Not by him, by you!

36:39.535 --> 36:41.204
Are you impugning my honour,
madam?

36:41.287 --> 36:42.622
Do you deny it?

36:43.414 --> 36:45.333
Not categorically, no.

36:45.416 --> 36:49.754
Then the contest is void
and your title is forfeit.

36:49.837 --> 36:53.091
I will not allow you to be
inaugurated as laird.

36:53.174 --> 36:56.886
My dear lady, I'm so sorry
to hear you say that

36:56.969 --> 36:59.180
but you've changed
your mind once.

36:59.263 --> 37:02.642
And perhaps I can persuade you
to change your mind again?

37:07.105 --> 37:11.526
I'm sorry, Paul, but you could
look on this as
a new beginning.

37:11.609 --> 37:15.446
There are loads of
opportunities for someone
with your experience.

37:15.530 --> 37:18.491
A trainee laird
who's failed his exams?

37:18.574 --> 37:23.579
Well, maybe you weren't
supposed to just sit around
here gathering moss.

37:23.663 --> 37:26.666
You can go anywhere,
you can do anything.

37:28.167 --> 37:29.752
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

37:30.795 --> 37:32.463
To hell with it.

37:32.547 --> 37:34.090
To hell with the lot of them.

37:34.173 --> 37:37.176
Paul, Ewan's on the phone.
He says it's urgent.

37:38.011 --> 37:39.887
Paul...

37:41.723 --> 37:43.057
It's not your problem
any more.

37:53.484 --> 37:54.902
He's locked up
Sheila MacDonald.

37:54.986 --> 37:57.613
I'm telling you,
Donald's lost the plot!

38:02.827 --> 38:05.580
How much sharper
than a serpent's tooth

38:05.663 --> 38:10.209
is the base ingratitude
of a little cook?

38:10.293 --> 38:11.919
I'm sorry it's not
an authentic dungeon,

38:12.003 --> 38:13.963
but it kept the servants
away from the claret.

38:14.047 --> 38:16.049
Donald, what is this
going to achieve?

38:16.132 --> 38:19.886
I am hoping to persuade the
proctor here to anoint me
as laird.

38:19.969 --> 38:21.721
You must be deranged!

38:21.804 --> 38:24.766
Then perhaps you should pray
for a knight
in shining armour.

38:24.849 --> 38:27.643
Only, they're a little thin
on the ground
these days.

38:27.727 --> 38:29.562
You're keeping us locked
up in here until we rot?

38:29.645 --> 38:33.232
Well, it's traditional.
I thought you liked that
sort of thing. Goodbye!

38:35.109 --> 38:38.029
But why didn't you tell me
Meg had come back?

38:38.112 --> 38:40.990
I thought you said you didn't
want to be bothered with
other people's problems.

38:41.074 --> 38:42.241
Oh, Golly!

38:44.077 --> 38:47.288
We've got to get
the proctor out before
someone reports her missing.

38:47.372 --> 38:49.415
What about Donald's friend
Shirley?

38:49.499 --> 38:52.460
Come on, there's more of us
than there are of them.

38:53.378 --> 38:55.421
What do you think, Paul?

38:55.505 --> 38:57.548
I think we should
call the police.

38:57.632 --> 39:00.927
Or we could sort it
out ourselves.

39:03.638 --> 39:06.933
Well, what we need is
a plan of attack
and someone to lead us.

39:10.603 --> 39:12.105
Paul?

39:12.855 --> 39:14.107
For your family.

39:21.114 --> 39:23.032
Well, first,
we've got to get in somehow.

39:23.741 --> 39:25.118
That's my boy.

39:27.328 --> 39:29.789
Okay, I suggest we all hit
the house at the same time.

39:29.872 --> 39:31.040
Golly, you take
the front door.

39:31.124 --> 39:33.793
Isobel, Jess, look for
open doors and windows.

39:33.876 --> 39:37.130
Lucy, you're coming with us,
yeah?

39:37.213 --> 39:42.385
-Yes, of course I am.
-Okay, you go with Isobel
and I'll take the first floor.

39:42.468 --> 39:45.805
Maybe it would help to have
someone on the inside.

39:58.776 --> 40:02.030
-Sushi, Shirley!
-Something I picked up
in Nagasaki.

40:02.113 --> 40:04.490
The hard part
is getting the seaweed.

40:06.492 --> 40:08.411
Oh, out of my way,
you silly man.

40:08.494 --> 40:10.538
She has such a way about her.

40:10.621 --> 40:11.622
(MOLLY LAUGHS)

40:12.790 --> 40:15.335
You all know what to do.
Good luck.

40:15.418 --> 40:17.170
I say, sushi!

40:17.253 --> 40:19.505
Shirley,
go and patrol somewhere.

40:28.389 --> 40:30.099
Banzai.

40:43.529 --> 40:47.533
As laird, you cannot
possibly wear
those rancid old tweeds.

40:52.121 --> 40:54.665
-Doesn't this feel
more aristocratic?
-Oh!

40:54.749 --> 40:56.376
Oh, yes.

40:58.670 --> 41:00.963
Mmm, oh...

41:01.047 --> 41:04.050
I feel a sudden urge
to execute someone.

41:14.185 --> 41:16.688
-Gotcha!
-Ahh!

41:16.771 --> 41:18.314
SHIRLEY: Your Lairdship,
we have intruders.

41:18.398 --> 41:21.442
At last we reap the whirlwind.

41:21.526 --> 41:25.530
It must be Paul. Quick,
go and help Shirley.

41:53.182 --> 41:55.935
I'm not letting you
invade today! Ha, ha!

41:56.019 --> 41:57.020
Ow!

41:58.146 --> 41:59.981
Stand back!

42:02.358 --> 42:03.818
Come on, come on!

42:07.321 --> 42:09.115
Shh, where's Paul?

42:09.198 --> 42:11.951
-And where's your precious
Molly?
-What?

42:12.035 --> 42:13.786
Where are my precious keys?

42:21.836 --> 42:24.547
You! Hold it right there.

42:52.992 --> 42:54.869
Surrender now
and nobody gets fired.

42:54.952 --> 42:56.496
Someone's gonna get fired,
all right.

42:56.579 --> 42:58.706
Yeah, that gorilla of yours
nearly broke my hand.

42:58.790 --> 43:01.250
A fitting punishment
for challenging
the rightful laird.

43:01.334 --> 43:02.877
-Paul's the rightful laird.
-Ha!

43:02.960 --> 43:05.254
We need no other.
Are we agreed?

43:05.338 --> 43:06.339
-Yes.
-Too right.

43:07.882 --> 43:11.552
Very touching,
but hardly a tradition,
Proctor.

43:11.636 --> 43:14.931
-Then we'll make it
a tradition.
-The fun's over, Donald.

43:15.014 --> 43:18.393
No more royal decrees,
no more taxing the tenants.

43:18.476 --> 43:21.020
Glenbogle needs a laird who
understands what the
word means.

43:21.104 --> 43:22.230
Now, hand over the ring.

43:23.189 --> 43:25.066
Such a fuss.

43:25.149 --> 43:27.860
All you had to do was ask.

43:27.944 --> 43:29.779
Excuse me. Excuse me.

43:29.862 --> 43:31.406
Excuse me.

43:31.489 --> 43:33.741
Paul? A word.

43:40.873 --> 43:43.251
Mind who you give it to
next time.

44:00.351 --> 44:04.355
Congratulations
on a successful coup d'etat.

44:04.439 --> 44:08.776
A coup is not successful,
Donald, until the previous
incumbent's been strung up.

44:08.860 --> 44:11.696
Ah, don't be like that,
I served a greater purpose
in the end.

44:11.779 --> 44:16.159
Don't you feel you've proved
yourself, that you've
seized your destiny?

44:16.242 --> 44:19.162
You're not gonna tell me
that you were
trying it on the whole time.

44:19.245 --> 44:23.124
I may have stretched
it out a bit,
but I was enjoying myself.

44:23.207 --> 44:25.376
Enjoying yourself?

44:25.460 --> 44:28.463
-But I felt so...
-Rejected? Useless?

44:28.546 --> 44:30.214
Oh, yes, been there,
done that.

44:30.298 --> 44:34.177
You see,
I knew what was eating you,
Paul.

44:34.260 --> 44:36.721
The fear you were
never good enough.

44:36.804 --> 44:39.766
It used to consume me.
I suppose it still does.

44:41.768 --> 44:46.314
-But you're a real MacDonald.
-And you're
a real MacDonald, too! Eh?

44:46.397 --> 44:49.734
The clan's acclaimed you,
accepted you.

44:49.817 --> 44:53.654
Of course, the one person you
really had to convince
was yourself.

44:53.738 --> 44:57.575
You were born to be laird,
dear boy.

44:57.658 --> 45:01.954
I wouldn't last a month
before they dragged me off
to the guillotine.

45:05.249 --> 45:07.210
(BOTH LAUGH)

45:11.255 --> 45:13.216
-So, how did you win
that quiz?
-Quiz?

45:13.299 --> 45:19.180
Ah, well... Ooh, you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

45:19.597 --> 45:20.765
Paul,

45:22.225 --> 45:23.476
may I have a word?

45:26.062 --> 45:27.522
You know Meg is leaving?

45:27.605 --> 45:30.692
Yep. I won't be waving her off
at the station, though.

45:30.775 --> 45:33.653
Why? What are you afraid of?

45:33.736 --> 45:35.905
Pain is part of life,
remember?

45:35.988 --> 45:38.157
No sorrow, no joy.

45:40.076 --> 45:42.662
So, Golly,
what are you doing here?

45:44.539 --> 45:46.749
You gave Donald the questions!

45:48.626 --> 45:50.253
Why?

45:50.336 --> 45:52.797
Because
I didn't want you to be laird.

45:52.880 --> 45:56.676
I thought, if you weren't,
then we'd have
a better chance...

45:56.759 --> 46:00.513
-It's complicated.
-Not for me, it wasn't.

46:00.596 --> 46:03.016
You knew what this
meant to me, Lucy.

46:04.684 --> 46:06.477
I did it because I love you.

46:06.561 --> 46:08.396
I wanted us to be together.

46:08.479 --> 46:13.317
And I knew that if you
loved me I could tell you
and you'd forgive me.

46:13.401 --> 46:15.153
I'm not sure
I can forgive you.

46:16.362 --> 46:18.281
Because you don't love me,
do you?

46:24.537 --> 46:26.080
Lucy...

46:29.625 --> 46:31.377
I wanted to.

46:34.964 --> 46:38.384
-It's just...
-It's just Isobel, isn't it?

46:40.428 --> 46:42.138
It's always been Isobel.

46:48.019 --> 46:49.228
I'm really sorry.

46:51.356 --> 46:53.733
So am I.

46:53.816 --> 46:55.568
So, that's us quits, then.

47:22.220 --> 47:24.013
Can I carry your bags, miss?

47:26.557 --> 47:29.435
Okay, but get a move on.

47:30.520 --> 47:32.146
Train leaves in 20 minutes.

47:32.230 --> 47:35.608
I know, I know,
but there's another
train tomorrow.

47:35.692 --> 47:39.028
There's a train every day,
in fact. Sometimes two.
Not a bad service.

47:39.112 --> 47:41.739
Look, we cannot start again,
Golly.

47:43.783 --> 47:45.243
Yes, we can.

47:46.828 --> 47:48.329
I love you, Meg.

47:48.413 --> 47:49.914
I love you.

47:51.833 --> 47:54.293
Come and live with me.

47:54.377 --> 47:55.837
Be your own woman.

47:57.672 --> 47:59.674
I wouldn't dream
of keeping you a prisoner.

48:00.967 --> 48:02.969
Molly told you, didn't she?

48:03.052 --> 48:07.932
-Yeah, but I knew you'd be
leaving sometime.
-No, I...

48:08.016 --> 48:10.435
I mean about the baby.

48:10.518 --> 48:13.521
-What baby?
-You didn't know?

48:14.564 --> 48:15.648
No.

48:18.401 --> 48:19.819
Our baby.

48:22.363 --> 48:23.865
Our baby?

48:27.869 --> 48:28.995
Just tell me what...

48:29.078 --> 48:30.580
Oh, Meg.

48:31.456 --> 48:32.665
Meg...

48:46.471 --> 48:48.431
-Isobel, hi.
-Hi.

48:48.514 --> 48:51.434
I just realised,
I never invited you to
the inauguration.

48:52.769 --> 48:53.853
But Lucy said...

48:57.523 --> 48:58.691
Doesn't matter.

49:00.526 --> 49:03.488
She's not coming.
Lucy and I...

49:04.238 --> 49:05.490
Aren't any more.

49:06.282 --> 49:07.367
Oh...

49:09.410 --> 49:12.914
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah. Yeah, so am I.

49:16.959 --> 49:19.629
So, are you coming
to this ceremony, then?

49:19.712 --> 49:21.547
I thought it was for friends
and family only.

49:21.631 --> 49:24.384
It is. And you are.

49:26.219 --> 49:28.429
Tonight, on the beach, 7:00.

49:30.223 --> 49:31.224
It's a bit short notice.

No, no, no, no, no.
No, come on.

49:35.186 --> 49:37.480
No, I didn't mention it
because I just took it for
granted that you'd be there.

49:37.563 --> 49:39.399
Excuse me?
You took me for granted?

49:39.482 --> 49:41.943
No, I didn't mean it
like that. Look...

49:42.026 --> 49:45.363
Why do you make this
so difficult? Do you want
to come, or don't you?

49:45.446 --> 49:47.448
I'd love to.

49:47.532 --> 49:50.118
But I'm busy. Sorry.

Molly, are you still doing
without earthly possessions?

50:05.383 --> 50:08.136
Hmm? Because someone
just dropped these off.

Oh! Thank you.

to dance?

you know.

you know.
