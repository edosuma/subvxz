MAN (over TV): We now return
to America's Next Top Model.

00:37.079 --> 00:39.331
I-I just don't think
you're being fair, Tyra.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.292
You don't know what it's like
to grow up the way I grew up.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.127
You know what?
How dare you?!

00:44.211 --> 00:46.129
You don't know me.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.633
You have no idea
where I come from, here I've been,

00:49.716 --> 00:51.885
(screeching):
how long I've been there,

00:51.969 --> 00:54.972
what I had to do
to get from where I was

00:55.055 --> 00:58.267
to where I am now!

01:01.436 --> 01:02.437
(doorbell ringing)

01:04.231 --> 01:05.315
Hey there, Mort.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.608
Hi, Lois.

01:06.692 --> 01:09.361
Neil's doing a report
on Christianity at school.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.030
Do you have any crucifixes
I can borrow?

01:12.114 --> 01:13.949
Preferably one without
the little fellow on it?

01:14.032 --> 01:15.242
Oh, of course, there's
one in the den.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.618
Help yourself.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.123
God, I'm sick of Mort
always borrowing our stuff.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.667
He's a bigger mooch
than the Mexican Super Friends.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.051
Hey, Mexican Superman,
can I talk to you for a sec?

01:33.135 --> 01:34.678
When you signed the lease,
you said there was

01:34.761 --> 01:36.805
going to be like five
of you living here.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.557
Oh, no, they're not
all living here.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.850
They're just visiting.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.978
(car horn blaring
"Tequila" riff)

01:43.061 --> 01:46.440
Hey, Mexican Superman,
I got the keys made.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.108
Hey, Mexican Batman,
get out of here.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.027
What? I got like
60 keys.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.987
(speaking Spanish)
Siléncio! Jefe aquí!

01:52.070 --> 01:54.198
¿Qué?
Evición.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.490
(tires screeching)

01:57.618 --> 01:59.244
That ought to
keep Mort away.

01:59.328 --> 02:00.954
Peter, what the hell
is that?

02:01.038 --> 02:03.207
Lois, I'm tired of Mort
always mooching off us,

02:03.290 --> 02:04.833
so I made a scare-Jew.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.419
Peter, we're not gonna have
this in our front yard.

02:07.503 --> 02:10.005
It's racist, and for God's sake,
you ruined your best suit.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.715
Now we're gonna have
to get you a new one...

02:11.798 --> 02:13.509
Shh-shh.
Lois, Lois, look.

02:13.592 --> 02:15.802
Hey, guys, I just wanted
to return your...

02:15.886 --> 02:18.430
Oh! Oh, my God,
it's Hitler!

02:18.514 --> 02:19.640
He's back! He's back!

02:19.723 --> 02:21.558
Hurry, protect Jon Stewart!

02:21.642 --> 02:23.644
He's our most important Jew!

02:27.231 --> 02:28.982
Why do we have to get
me a suit here?

02:29.066 --> 02:30.150
Well, since you keep
ruining them,

02:30.234 --> 02:32.152
I'm not going to buy
you a brand-new one.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.489
Yes, I'll take this teddy bear,

02:35.572 --> 02:38.575
this ruler, this piece of string

02:38.659 --> 02:40.118
and this cardboard box.

02:40.202 --> 02:42.454
Mm-hmm.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.625
Oh, look,
an "On The Raggedy Ann" doll.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.794
It's water weight,
you bastard!

02:48.877 --> 02:49.878
Get off me!

02:49.962 --> 02:51.296
I'm not your whore.

02:51.380 --> 02:54.883
(sobbing):
I'm sorry, I'm just so sad.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.301
Well, I guess
I can still play with it

02:56.385 --> 02:58.428
three weeks out of the month.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.389
Hi, there. See
anything you like?

03:00.472 --> 03:01.682
Oh, I'm just browsing.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.434
Say, you look like you
could use an activity book

03:04.518 --> 03:06.061
with half the
activities done.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.522
Wow, that would save me
half the time.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.898
Connect the dots?

03:09.982 --> 03:12.943
Ha! More like set the book
down and have a beer.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.945
You got yourself a deal.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.448
(celestial music playing)

03:18.532 --> 03:21.159
What... are those?!

03:21.243 --> 03:23.453
Oh, that's a pair of red
flannel feety pajamas.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.788
Good Lord.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.207
See, they've got a flap
that opens up in the back.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.793
Are you telling me I
could be pooping and warm?

03:29.877 --> 03:31.295
Exactly.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.631
No longer would I have
to make a choice between the two.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.009
Sir, here is a check
with my name on it.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.970
Write down any number
on this piece of paper, and I will pay it.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.392
All right, so
we roll the dice

03:45.475 --> 03:47.352
and then we both have to
yell "Yahtzee" really loud.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.520
At the same time?
Yeah.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.564
And you have to flap
your wrists like this.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.816
And you'll do it, too?
Of course, that's how it's done.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.234
Okay.
All right, ready?

03:54.318 --> 03:56.361
Okay, you gonna do it with me?
Oh, yeah.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.446
Yahtzee!

03:57.529 --> 03:59.031
Gay.
You suck!

03:59.114 --> 04:00.657
Hey, everybody,
I'm home from work.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.785
My God, Peter, you wore
those pajamas to your office?

04:03.869 --> 04:05.579
Hey, at least
I'm mixing it up a little bit.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.873
Green shirt, tan pants,
that's refreshing.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.708
Oh, boy does
it feel good

04:09.791 --> 04:11.001
to undo my butt flap.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.252
Ew, Dad!

04:12.336 --> 04:14.588
We don't want to sit here
and look at your ass.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.257
Yes, I'd rather look at Meg
toweling off after a shower

04:17.341 --> 04:20.010
when she does that
butt floss thing.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.595
Ew, ew, that's so disgusting.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.931
Ugh, ugh, I hope I don't ever
accidentally use that towel.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.557
(yells)

04:25.641 --> 04:27.893
Lois, I have never
been more comfortable

04:27.976 --> 04:30.312
as a person than I am
in these feety pajamas.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.813
All warm and furry.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.649
This is what it feels
like to be a bear.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.859
You remember what I used
to say, Lois, when we first got married?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.487
You remember? I used to say,
"What would it feel like to be a bear"?

04:38.570 --> 04:39.821
Well, this is it.

04:39.905 --> 04:41.573
This is it-- I'm
living it, baby.

04:41.657 --> 04:42.908
No, you're not.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.118
You've been wearing those
things for three days.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.328
You can wear them to bed,

04:46.411 --> 04:47.704
but tomorrow we're
getting rid of them.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.914
(sighs)
Fine.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.916
Screw up all
my fuzziness.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.292
(feet shuffling)

04:52.376 --> 04:53.669
(electrical snap)
(yells)

04:53.752 --> 04:55.963
What the hell was that?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.130
(electrical snap)
(yells)

04:57.214 --> 04:59.758
Oh, my God.
Lois, don't get alarmed,

04:59.842 --> 05:02.094
but I think I might be Jesus.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.595
I'm Jesus.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.180
Peter, that's
a static shock.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.349
Your pajamas created
a charge of electricity

05:07.432 --> 05:09.351
when you dragged your
feet across the carpet,

05:09.434 --> 05:11.103
and when you touched
Chris, you passed it on.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.771
Kneel before Christ!

05:12.855 --> 05:13.897
(electrical snap)
(yells)

05:18.986 --> 05:20.988
(feet shuffling)
(chuckling)

05:22.406 --> 05:23.740
(electrical snap)
(yells)

05:23.824 --> 05:26.118
Dad!
I am not your dad.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.580
I am Electric Man.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.544
(chuckling)

05:37.296 --> 05:39.214
Ow! Damn it,
Peter, stop it!

05:39.298 --> 05:40.966
I got to tell you,
you're pissing me off

05:41.049 --> 05:42.426
worse than when I watched
the O.J. verdict

05:42.509 --> 05:43.594
with my old roommate.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.888
WOMAN:
We the jury find the defendant

05:45.971 --> 05:48.390
Orenthal James Simpson,
not guilty...

05:48.473 --> 05:50.100
Yes!
What the hell?!

05:50.184 --> 05:52.060
What?!
What?!

05:52.144 --> 05:53.645
Maybe we should
get new roommates.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.397
Yeah, maybe we should.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.483
(Peter giggling)

05:58.567 --> 06:01.111
Peter, I know you're in here.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.613
Yes, I am,
Lois.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.490
But where?

06:05.574 --> 06:08.118
Peter, if you shock me,
I swear to God I'm leaving you.

06:08.202 --> 06:10.078
You'll have to find
me first, Lois.

06:10.162 --> 06:11.955
Where could
I be?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.624
Well, there's a Quonset hut

06:13.707 --> 06:15.292
that I've never seen in
this room before.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.627
I got to figure
you're in there.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.045
How do you know, Lois?

06:18.128 --> 06:20.881
I could be in that New York
style magazine kiosk.

06:20.964 --> 06:23.008
Peter, this all
looks very expensive.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.219
Yes, you might say
it was...

06:25.302 --> 06:27.095
shockingly expensive.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.931
I'm going to try
the Quonset hut.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.015
(electrical snap)
(yells)

06:30.098 --> 06:31.725
(laughing):
I was in the bathroom.

06:31.808 --> 06:35.354
The hut and the kiosk--
decoys, Lois, decoys!

06:38.232 --> 06:39.858
Glen, thank you
so much

06:39.942 --> 06:41.860
for helping me
tear up my carpet.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.904
Well, you know, Lois,
I got to confess,

06:43.987 --> 06:45.489
when you called me I sort
of misunderstood

06:45.572 --> 06:46.573
what you were asking for.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.116
That's why I rushed over.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.868
But, uh... well, it's fine,
it's fine, whatever,

06:49.952 --> 06:50.953
I'm happy to help.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.454
What the hell is this?

06:52.538 --> 06:54.831
Peter, I've had it
with all your shocking.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.416
Since you won't get rid
of those pajamas,

06:56.500 --> 06:58.043
I'm getting rid
of the carpets.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.128
Hey, Lois, you want me to leave
a little strip in this thing?

07:00.212 --> 07:02.631
Maybe a lightning bolt,
unicorn, something like that?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.633
No, I want it all
gone, Glen.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.052
All right,
we're going Brazilian.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.554
Hey, what's this?

07:08.637 --> 07:09.888
Some kind of really
old coin.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.682
Huh. Let me see that.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.225
Wait a minute, do you know
what this is?

07:13.308 --> 07:15.936
This is an 18th-century
Rhode Island ship token.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.437
This thing's got
to be worth 50 grand.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.064
50 grand?!

07:19.147 --> 07:20.357
Oh, my God!

07:20.440 --> 07:21.942
I can finally afford
that operation

07:22.025 --> 07:24.695
to swap my vocal cords
with Patrick Stewart.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.864
(Patrick Stewart's voice):
Hey, Lois, I spent the afternoon

07:26.947 --> 07:29.324
making a list of
famous Armenians.

07:29.408 --> 07:32.119
Eric Bogosian,
Andre Agassi,

07:32.202 --> 07:34.496
Jerry "The Shark"
Tarkanian.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.831
That is all.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.587
Peter, you've been sleeping
with that money for the past week.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.839
Don't you think it's time
we did something with it?

07:43.922 --> 07:45.507
Buy a bolt and shut
that trap of yours?

07:45.591 --> 07:46.592
What?
What?

07:46.675 --> 07:47.759
'Cause I had an idea.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.261
Remember when we
first got married...

07:49.344 --> 07:51.221
And I said, "I wonder what
it would be like to be a bear"?

07:51.305 --> 07:54.141
No, no, no, I'm talking
about that dream we had, Peter.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.518
Remember? We tried to
open that restaurant,

07:56.602 --> 07:58.896
and we never quite
got it going.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.940
Yeah, we got shut down
'cause of my exploding cupcakes.

08:02.024 --> 08:05.360
Mmm, I hope these taste
as good as they look.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.613
(gasps):
Gerald!

08:07.696 --> 08:08.864
(chuckles)

08:08.947 --> 08:10.574
The secret is in the frosting.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.910
But I'll never tell.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.579
Well, here's another chance
to open a restaurant.

08:15.662 --> 08:16.914
You're right.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.540
Ooh, and I'll make
my special cupcakes.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.959
No, Peter...
Oh, yeah, right, that was the problem.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.176
All right, everybody,
only three hours till opening.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.803
Oh, this is going to be
the coolest place in Quahog.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.764
All the movers and shakers
and bigwigs

08:33.847 --> 08:36.850
are going to eat here...
but not the small wigs.

08:36.934 --> 08:39.353
Hey, I'm hungry.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.146
I got a credit card.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.981
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

08:43.065 --> 08:44.775
I hope it goes well.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.360
Oh, yes, I'm sure it
will go as well

08:46.443 --> 08:48.403
as Liza Minnelli's
Playboy shoot.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.656
Oh, God, please put
your clothes back on.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.033
Mama... Mama...

08:53.116 --> 08:55.410
Do you love me now, Mama?

08:55.494 --> 08:57.829
(sobbing):
Please love me, Mama!

09:02.251 --> 09:04.002
Good evening. Welcome to
Big Pete's House of Munch.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.379
May I help you?

09:05.462 --> 09:07.381
Yes, do you accept
the Discover card?

09:07.464 --> 09:10.551
Ha! Hey, Lois, Diamond
Jim Brady over here

09:10.634 --> 09:13.220
just asked if we accept
the Discover card.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.974
LOIS: Oh, they're in an exclusive
club called anybody.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.058
Yeah.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.601
No, no, no, I
don't think so.

09:19.685 --> 09:22.813
You know, you know,
I would rather take two live chickens

09:22.896 --> 09:24.982
than your fly-by-
night credit card.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.484
I would rather take
a jar of pennies

09:27.568 --> 09:29.945
that's value was less
than that of your bill.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.613
Look, you don't
have to insult me.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.991
No, no, no, you are going
to sit there and listen

09:34.074 --> 09:35.784
to the funny things
I would take

09:35.868 --> 09:37.327
instead of your
credit card.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.164
The guy at table seven
complained

09:41.248 --> 09:43.500
there's not enough juice
on his prime rib.

09:43.584 --> 09:44.918
Oh, did he, now?

09:45.002 --> 09:46.336
Let me take care
of that for him.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.130
(rat squeaking)

09:48.213 --> 09:49.715
(retching)

09:49.798 --> 09:52.217
Tell him, bon
appétit, douchebag.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.139
Oh, look, it's one of those
early Maude episodes

09:57.222 --> 09:59.558
with the really long
opening credit sequence.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.769

11:19.847 --> 11:21.223
That was an ordeal.

11:21.306 --> 11:23.642
Well, Peter, this has
been an amazing week.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.519
You and I own
a restaurant.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.020
Can you believe it?

11:27.104 --> 11:28.397
I know. I feel
like I'm dreaming.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.941
Wait. Maybe I am dreaming.

11:31.024 --> 11:35.195
That means I can do whatever
I want without consequences.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.363
(whimpering)

11:36.446 --> 11:38.031
What are you doing?

11:38.115 --> 11:40.200
I just adopted 30 puppies!

11:40.284 --> 11:41.952
(laughing)

11:42.035 --> 11:44.746
Who's a (baby talk)?
Who's a (baby talk)?

11:44.830 --> 11:46.498
Who's a (baby talk)?

11:46.582 --> 11:48.375
(laughing)

11:48.458 --> 11:50.711
(puppies growling, barking)

11:50.794 --> 11:52.713
(laughing continues)

11:54.840 --> 11:56.800
You guys, I have
some bad news.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.260
I just finished
going over the books,

11:58.343 --> 12:00.637
and this restaurant
is hemorrhaging money.

12:00.721 --> 12:02.890
What? Well, how
is that possible?

12:02.973 --> 12:04.141
Isn't it obvious?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.559
We're not getting
enough customers.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.603
This place is like
a ghost town half the time.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.938
Yeah. Maybe somebody
should have asked me.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.398
After all, I'm the only one
in this family

12:11.481 --> 12:13.108
with any business experience.

12:13.192 --> 12:14.860
All right,
Violet and Pigpen,

12:14.943 --> 12:16.486
you've been seeing each other
a few weeks now.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.779
What seems
to be the problem?

12:17.863 --> 12:18.947
I keep getting
bladder infections,

12:19.031 --> 12:20.407
and I don't know why.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.243
Really?
You don't know why?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.664
I don't know
what to do, guys.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.000
The House of Munch
is going down the tubes.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.669
Maybe you need
to do a little advertising, Peter.

12:32.753 --> 12:33.921
Well, I tried.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.255
I even hired
M. Night Shyamalan

12:35.339 --> 12:37.174
to direct my TV commercial.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.468
(whispering):
I have a secret to tell you.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.094
What is it?
Come closer.

12:42.012 --> 12:45.641
I see good food
at competitive prices.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.393
At Big Pete's House of Munch!
Stop on by!

12:48.477 --> 12:50.062
Unfortunately,
they couldn't air it,

12:50.145 --> 12:51.271
'cause it turns out
M. Night Shyamalan

12:51.355 --> 12:52.981
was involved
with September 11.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.775
You know, Peter,
my buddies and I

12:54.858 --> 12:56.652
have been looking
for a new hangout.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.946
Our usual doughnut shop
has gotten a little...

12:59.029 --> 13:01.114
Puerto Ricany.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.825
What if we made your
place our new spot?

13:03.909 --> 13:05.786
Joe, that's
a great idea!

13:05.869 --> 13:07.871
Fantastic! We'll
see you tonight.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.289
This is awesome!

13:09.373 --> 13:12.376
Bunch of cops in uniform
hanging out in my restaurant?

13:12.459 --> 13:14.002
This is going to be
cooler than that time

13:14.086 --> 13:16.547
Ben Stiller taught me
how to be myself.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.591
But how can you
leave me now, Ben Stiller,

13:19.675 --> 13:21.301
when I need you
more than ever?

13:21.385 --> 13:23.846
I've taught you everything
you need to know, Peter.

13:23.929 --> 13:26.431
Now it's time for me
to go help another child.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.058
I guess
I just fooled myself

13:28.141 --> 13:30.352
into thinking
you'd always be with me.

13:30.435 --> 13:31.562
I will, Peter.

13:31.645 --> 13:34.064
I will always
be with you.

13:43.198 --> 13:45.784
His movies are terrible...

13:50.873 --> 13:52.291
Lois, roll out
the red carpet.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.042
Here comes Joe
and his cop buddies.

13:54.126 --> 13:56.170
You got tables for 30?

14:00.174 --> 14:02.009
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Joe!

14:02.092 --> 14:03.719
I thought you were bringing
your cop friends over.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.762
What are all these
parallelograms doing here?

14:05.846 --> 14:07.472
You mean paraplegics.

14:07.556 --> 14:08.891
These are my friends, Peter.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.934
Come on, guys. Let's eat.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.895
Oh, God. I hope
there's not one of those angry,

14:12.978 --> 14:15.772
handicapped Vietnam guys
with the bandana on his head.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.274
Oh! There he is.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.235
I've seen some things,
man, and some stuff.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.904
I wouldn't recommend it.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.118
(buzz of chatter)

14:30.370 --> 14:31.997
Peter, isn't
this wonderful?

14:32.080 --> 14:33.665
The place is packed.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.375
Uh... Lois, uh...

14:35.459 --> 14:37.044
aren't you a little
freaked out by this?

14:37.127 --> 14:39.588
Why? Everybody's
having a great time.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.507
Besides, think of the
money we're making.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.133
I don't care about that.

14:43.217 --> 14:44.635
I wanted
a cool restaurant,

14:44.718 --> 14:47.012
not the cafeteria
at the veteran's hospital.

14:47.095 --> 14:51.016
This is weirder than
that rap video by M.C. Escher.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.935
♪ Going up the stairs
and going down the stairs ♪

14:53.018 --> 14:55.062
♪ And going up the stairs
and going down the stairs ♪

14:55.145 --> 14:57.314
♪ And going up
the sideways stairs. ♪

15:00.108 --> 15:02.903
And, in local news, a new restaurant
is taking Quahog by storm.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.446
That's right, Diane.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.782
If you're handicapped,
or know someone who's handicapped,

15:06.865 --> 15:08.408
or just happen
to be a fan of the circus,

15:08.492 --> 15:10.786
then come on down
to Big Pete's House of Munch,

15:10.869 --> 15:13.163
where the elite without feet
meet to eat.

15:13.247 --> 15:14.957
Lois, this is insanity.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.458
I think we should shut
down the restaurant.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.211
But... why?
We're doing so well.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.838
Lois, let me explain
something to you, all right?

15:20.921 --> 15:22.840
Cripples are not cool.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.341
Hang on. I'm going
to get the picture.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.467
Oh, Peter, don't...

15:25.551 --> 15:27.594
(shouting gibberish)

15:27.678 --> 15:28.804
What do you
see here, Lois?

15:28.887 --> 15:30.389
Do we have to...?
What do you see?!

15:30.472 --> 15:33.058
(sighs)
A picture of Mark Harmon.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.935
A picture of Mark Harmon,

15:35.018 --> 15:37.020
the greatest actor
who ever lived.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.480
Do you see a wheelchair
under Mark Harmon?

15:38.564 --> 15:39.565
Peter...

15:39.648 --> 15:44.486
Lois, do you...
see a wheelchair...

15:44.570 --> 15:46.405
under Mark Harmon?

15:46.488 --> 15:47.948
No.
No, you do not,

15:48.031 --> 15:50.075
because Mark Harmon
is cool.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.493
And I know what
you're thinking.

15:51.577 --> 15:53.829
"Oh, Peter, this is just
like your Gil Gerard speech."

15:53.912 --> 15:56.582
And you can stop
right in your tracks, because it is not.

15:56.665 --> 15:59.251
Granted, it is similar
to the Gil Gerard speech, but it...

15:59.334 --> 16:01.545
Peter, I like our restaurant
the way it is,

16:01.628 --> 16:04.006
and if you don't,
that's your problem.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.884
Fine. Then I'll deal
with this myself.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.722
All right, here they come.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.226
Hey, Peter,
we're here for dinner.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.561
Oh no, you're
not, Joe.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.104
We have a new policy.

16:19.188 --> 16:20.189
Can't you read the sign?

16:23.066 --> 16:24.818
Peter, what the hell
is that all about?

16:24.902 --> 16:26.612
It's a message, Joe.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.822
I don't want you
and your kind eating here anymore.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.324
You're ruining
what was supposed

16:30.407 --> 16:31.992
to be a cool
establishment.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.286
Peter, you're one
of my closest friends.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.621
Are you... you telling me
that you have a problem

16:35.704 --> 16:37.372
with me being handicapped?

16:37.456 --> 16:38.582
As a matter of
fact, Joe, yes.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.167
I think it's immoral.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.045
It's a lifestyle choice
you're forcing on America.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.756
We handicapped
are a proud people!

16:45.839 --> 16:47.174
Yeah, when you're not
drinking and gambling

16:47.257 --> 16:49.843
on your reservations,
which we gave you.

16:49.927 --> 16:52.638
Fine, if that's
the way you want it,

16:52.721 --> 16:55.849
but we're not going
to go down easy.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.434
Okay, that was easy.

16:57.518 --> 17:00.062
But I'll be back
with more handicapped guys!

17:05.359 --> 17:07.903
Dad, look! Here they come!

17:12.324 --> 17:15.827
Peter, we'll give you
one last chance to let us in!

17:15.911 --> 17:17.454
Heh! What are you
going to do, Joe?

17:17.538 --> 17:19.039
I'm up here.

17:19.122 --> 17:22.292
(high-pitched, sing-songy):
And you're down there.

17:22.376 --> 17:24.962
Very well, Peter,
you leave us no choice.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.006
Men, form up Crippletron!

17:30.843 --> 17:33.220
(mechanical whirring)

18:02.374 --> 18:03.792
(screams)

18:09.798 --> 18:13.594
(Joe screaming)

18:17.764 --> 18:21.935
Help! Help! Somebody help me!

18:22.019 --> 18:24.396
Ben Stiller, help me.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.982
No, Peter. I heard what
you said about my movies.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.066
How did you hear?

18:28.150 --> 18:29.193
Hello!

18:29.276 --> 18:31.862
Go to hell, you
mutant offspring of comedy people.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.618
Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid
he'll never walk again...

18:37.701 --> 18:40.037
(both gasp) without remembering
how lucky he is

18:40.120 --> 18:41.955
that he'll only be in this
wheelchair for two weeks.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.166
That leg should
heal up just fine.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.251
Peter, you do realize
you deserve this

18:46.335 --> 18:47.461
for the way
you treated Joe.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.505
I think you owe
him an apology.

18:49.588 --> 18:51.089
Are you kidding, Lois?

18:51.173 --> 18:52.925
It ain't my fault that him
and all his gimpy friends

18:53.008 --> 18:54.801
don't fit in with
regular society.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.136
