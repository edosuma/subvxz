00:51.458 --> 00:55.656
Miguel!

01:01.018 --> 01:03.691
Miguel!

01:41.378 --> 01:43.209
Miguel.

01:46.938 --> 01:48.815
Miguel.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.812
Gwangi.

02:03.978 --> 02:05.650
No, no.

02:05.818 --> 02:09.970
Leave it. He who takes
from Gwangi the evil one is cursed.

02:10.138 --> 02:12.606
- Only by an old woman's tongue.
- I tell you...

02:12.778 --> 02:15.246
...if he does not go back
to the Forbidden Valley...

02:15.418 --> 02:17.773
...we shall all suffer a terrible fate.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.406
My eyes are blind,
but I can still see the signs.

02:20.578 --> 02:23.934
Keep your superstitions
to yourself, old woman.

02:25.738 --> 02:27.694
Fool.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.334
One day he will learn
to obey the law of Gwangi...

02:32.498 --> 02:36.013
...or like his brother, he will perish.

05:44.458 --> 05:46.369
Howdy, ma'am.

05:49.778 --> 05:52.975
- Carry your case, señor?
- Don't bother me, boy.

05:53.138 --> 05:55.936
- But don't you need a guide?
- No, don't need a guide.

05:56.098 --> 05:58.487
- What about an interpreter?
- Or an interpreter.

05:58.658 --> 06:01.013
- You need a horse?
- Now look, boy, I told you...

06:01.178 --> 06:04.534
...I don't need anything.
Now get lost, comprende? Adiós.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.690
There is no money in that, señor.

06:10.978 --> 06:13.890
- You want to do something for me?
- If the money is right.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.966
- Tell me where the arena is.
- Two miles out of town.

06:18.573 --> 06:21.326
- Two miles?
- You'll need that horse, señor.

06:21.493 --> 06:22.528
And a guide.

06:23.893 --> 06:27.090
You're a real hustler. I bet
your pappy sends you out hustling...

06:27.253 --> 06:29.323
...while he stays home taking a siesta.

06:29.493 --> 06:31.643
No, señor, my papa is dead.

06:32.213 --> 06:34.681
I run my own business.
My name is Lope.

06:35.653 --> 06:39.089
Okay, Lope, you and me
will do some business together.

06:39.453 --> 06:42.331
- Now how about getting me that horse?
- Ten pesos, señor.

06:45.293 --> 06:47.602
And 5 more for the saddle.

06:49.893 --> 06:52.885
The first million's
always the toughest, Lope.

08:04.773 --> 08:07.845
Ladies and gentlemen...

08:08.413 --> 08:11.689
...I now have the honor to present...

08:12.093 --> 08:17.121
...the lovely and talented star
of our show...

08:17.453 --> 08:20.525
...riding Wonder Horse Omar...

08:20.893 --> 08:25.489
...Miss T.J. Breckenridge.

08:33.332 --> 08:36.086
- Well, I'll be.
- Hey, Tuck. Tuck Kirby.

08:36.253 --> 08:38.049
Hi, there.

08:47.893 --> 08:50.726
Now, what in the name of Sam Hill
brings you around here?

08:50.893 --> 08:52.690
Up to no good, that's for sure.

08:52.853 --> 08:54.923
You don't seem glad to see me, Champ.

08:55.093 --> 08:57.891
About as glad as a dying mule
to see a vulture.

08:58.053 --> 09:00.248
I'm no vulture.
Bird on the wing, maybe.

09:00.413 --> 09:04.372
Yeah, flying to the next quick buck.
Well, it looks like you finally made it.

09:04.533 --> 09:07.206
- I make out all right.
- All you care about is yourself...

09:07.373 --> 09:10.445
...no matter who gets hurt.
I still care what happens to T.J.

09:10.613 --> 09:13.650
Yeah, always did.
Fussing around her like a mother hen.

09:13.813 --> 09:17.726
Her daddy was a friend. Somebody's
gotta protect her from guys like you.

09:17.893 --> 09:21.203
- Running out on her like you did.
- You weren't sorry to see me go.

09:21.373 --> 09:24.206
Nope, but it darn near broke T.J.'s heart.

09:24.653 --> 09:28.168
Yeah. From what I hear,
you're not doing so good by her either.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.130
Not enough customers
to pay the bill.

09:30.533 --> 09:34.367
We don't need any big shot coming
telling us how to run this show.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.172
- Now, why don't you just go back...
- Wait a minute.

09:37.813 --> 09:41.408
Well, that's her tune.
That's the grand finale, isn't it?

09:41.573 --> 09:44.451
Well, now, I'm surprised
you remembered.

09:44.693 --> 09:49.289
Well, excuse me, I gotta see this.
For old times' sake, you understand?

10:48.813 --> 10:50.644
Carlos.

11:58.133 --> 12:00.169
Hurry up with that ramp.

12:43.613 --> 12:46.207
- Howdy there, partner.
- Ex-partner.

12:46.373 --> 12:48.841
And to what do we owe
this unpleasant surprise?

12:49.013 --> 12:51.163
- I'm just looking around.
- For trouble.

12:51.333 --> 12:55.121
They say it comes in threes.
I wonder what the next two will be.

12:57.493 --> 12:59.211
Hey, you can't go in there!

13:00.173 --> 13:01.811
Get out.

13:01.973 --> 13:04.931
- Been a long time, T.J.
- Do you want to get killed?

13:05.093 --> 13:07.561
You're the one
who's always trying it out there.

13:07.733 --> 13:09.485
Don't start that again.

13:09.653 --> 13:12.213
You and me are gonna have
a nice little talk...

13:12.373 --> 13:14.409
...or I might just
put you across my knee.

13:14.573 --> 13:17.804
Fat chance. This is T.J., remember?

13:17.973 --> 13:20.043
Sure, I remember.

13:20.693 --> 13:25.369
- If you don't mind, I'd like to change.
- Well, go on, go ahead.

13:28.693 --> 13:31.366
Hey, you hesitated up there,
before the jump.

13:31.533 --> 13:34.491
The sight of you would upset
your own mother.

13:34.653 --> 13:37.486
- Not pulling much of a crowd.
- We play Villarosa next.

13:37.653 --> 13:39.484
Things will be better there.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.484
- You sure?
- Sure, I'm sure.

13:41.893 --> 13:43.565
- Why is that?
- What do you care?

13:43.733 --> 13:46.088
You've got your own business now.

13:46.253 --> 13:48.687
Yep. That's right. A one-man operation.

13:48.853 --> 13:51.242
Sitting in a nice office,
buying and selling acts...

13:51.413 --> 13:53.973
...instead of getting knocked off
horses for 10 bucks.

13:54.133 --> 13:57.648
- It's half the risk, twice the pay.
- So mind your own business.

13:57.813 --> 14:00.373
I'm doing just that.
Got a deal for you, T.J.

14:00.693 --> 14:03.571
Get you off the hook with
this broken-down, moth-eaten rodeo.

14:03.733 --> 14:05.963
- If you got a brain, you'll take it.
- Thanks.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.847
Buffalo Bill wants to buy Omar
the Wonder Horse.

14:09.013 --> 14:10.412
He's offering a good price.

14:10.573 --> 14:13.406
- And you get 10%, right?
- Twenty.

14:14.293 --> 14:17.603
Well, you're not getting
one thin dime out of me.

14:17.773 --> 14:22.005
And Buffalo Bill is not getting Omar.
And you needn't think you can come...

14:22.173 --> 14:25.961
...busting in here like some hick-town
horse-dealer trying to ruin my show.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.808
There's people depending on me:
Champ, Carlos, Bean, Rowdy.

14:30.173 --> 14:32.641
But you wouldn't know much
about loyalty, would you?

14:33.173 --> 14:35.562
- This is business.
- You play your con tricks...

14:35.733 --> 14:39.169
...and I'll stick to horse tricks.
Now beat it.

14:41.933 --> 14:44.447
My, my. Always did look
sweet in a temper.

14:44.853 --> 14:48.846
- Get out, I said.
- All right, I've hotter irons in the fire.

14:49.173 --> 14:52.643
You just keep struggling, leaping off
platforms into a pot of water.

14:52.813 --> 14:55.725
Break your neck if you want to.
Makes no difference to me.

14:55.893 --> 14:56.928
Good.

14:57.093 --> 15:01.325
Just worried about that horse up there.
Wouldn't like anything to happen to him.

15:05.133 --> 15:06.885
Excuse me.

15:11.133 --> 15:16.207
Good for you, T.J. You should've done
that a long time ago. Thrown him out.

15:26.933 --> 15:32.371
I say! Hello, there. Over here, sir!

15:32.853 --> 15:36.209
- Someone you know?
- A client of mine, Professor Bromley.

15:36.373 --> 15:39.570
- What's he doing out there?
- He digs for old bones and things.

15:39.733 --> 15:41.212
Hello!

15:41.373 --> 15:44.570
Sounds like he dug himself
into trouble. Come on.

15:48.213 --> 15:52.570
- I say, thank heavens you came along.
- What has happened, professor?

15:52.733 --> 15:56.248
"What has happened, professor?"
You know very well what has happened.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.132
- Rosita?
- Rosita. Rosita's my mule.

15:59.293 --> 16:01.887
She absolutely refused to budge.
Then she kicked me.

16:02.053 --> 16:04.248
- I don't know where she's gone now.
- You hurt?

16:04.413 --> 16:10.329
Well, there are no bones broken,
but it's frightfully painful.

16:10.493 --> 16:13.246
Oh, I don't believe we've met.
My name is Bromley.

16:13.413 --> 16:15.324
- Hi, name's Tuck Kirby.
- How do you do?

16:15.493 --> 16:18.007
Hey, hop on, we'll give you a ride back.

16:18.613 --> 16:23.084
Well, perhaps Lope's mount
might be a little more practical.

16:23.253 --> 16:25.847
Wait, my boy.

16:26.013 --> 16:27.890
Up.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.406
Right.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.525
You ought to know better than
to get behind a stubborn mule.

16:35.693 --> 16:39.732
Your advice comes
a little late, Mr. Kirby.

16:45.533 --> 16:48.286
Look, professor,
Rosita's found her way home.

16:48.453 --> 16:50.603
Vicious beast.

16:52.133 --> 16:54.442
Give me your shoulder, Lope.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.723
I'd say you could use
a good, stiff drink.

17:07.893 --> 17:11.681
You're right, Mr. Kirby.
It's in the trunk there.

17:15.413 --> 17:18.405
Lope tells me you're one of these
archaeologist fellows.

17:18.573 --> 17:22.122
Well, he's pretty near the mark.
Actually...

17:22.292 --> 17:24.363
...I'm a paleontologist.

17:24.532 --> 17:26.523
- We dig deeper.
- My father used to say...

17:26.693 --> 17:28.330
...it is not good to dig up the past.

17:28.693 --> 17:31.048
Let sleeping dogs lie, eh?

17:31.213 --> 17:33.488
We're not gonna get very far
that way, are we?

17:33.653 --> 17:37.566
- That depends on where you want to go.
- The bottom of things, of course.

17:37.733 --> 17:40.293
What Darwin did with
his theory of evolution...

17:40.453 --> 17:42.762
...I intend to do with
my theory of humanoids.

17:42.973 --> 17:45.248
- "Humanoids"?
- It means, "man-like."

17:45.613 --> 17:50.209
It's believed amongst paleontologists
that man evolved a million years ago.

17:50.573 --> 17:54.088
I intend to prove it was
many eons before that.

17:54.253 --> 17:59.725
If you'd like to look in that trunk, you'll
find a piece of rock. Will you get it?

18:09.013 --> 18:10.765
That's it.

18:12.453 --> 18:15.650
Now look at the fossil.
The impression left in the rock.

18:16.093 --> 18:19.881
- That looks like some sort of footprint.
- Precisely, it's an Eohippus.

18:20.053 --> 18:21.964
- Eo...?
- Eohippus.

18:22.133 --> 18:26.490
The so-called dawn horse.
The ancestor of our present-day horses.

18:26.653 --> 18:30.282
I never saw a horse small enough
to leave a print like that.

18:30.453 --> 18:32.205
Did you notice it had three toes?

18:32.373 --> 18:35.206
Over the period of evolution,
horses have grown larger.

18:35.373 --> 18:38.046
And that center toe has become
the hoof as we know it.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.842
What is more incredible
is the fossil beside it.

18:44.013 --> 18:46.607
I am convinced that
is the tibia of some humanoid...

18:46.773 --> 18:49.162
...that existed at the same time
as the Eohippus.

18:49.333 --> 18:53.724
Possibly more than 50 million years ago.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.130
- You found this thing around here?
- In the foothills.

18:58.293 --> 19:03.048
This is my whole life, Mr. Kirby,
but I need time and money.

19:03.213 --> 19:07.206
My resources,
both financial and physical...

19:07.373 --> 19:10.251
...are running precariously low.

19:10.413 --> 19:12.847
Well, professor, what you
need is a good rest.

19:13.013 --> 19:17.131
Yes, Mr. Kirby.
Thank you for your kindness.

19:17.293 --> 19:18.851
Lope.

19:32.533 --> 19:35.650
I'll bet you didn't know that
was your middle toe, did you?

19:48.133 --> 19:49.452
- T.J.?
- Yeah?

19:49.613 --> 19:51.569
- Can I speak to you a moment?
- Of course.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.644
In private.

19:57.573 --> 20:00.485
You want that money I owe you.
Don't worry, you'll get it.

20:00.653 --> 20:02.723
We'll pack them in
with our new attraction.

20:02.893 --> 20:04.690
Yes, El Diablo will be
a big success...

20:04.853 --> 20:07.572
- Quiet. That's between us.
- It's not only money.

20:07.973 --> 20:11.363
- What else?
- Us. Together. You and me and Diablo...

20:11.533 --> 20:14.764
In the meantime, let's see
how we go in Villarosa.

20:35.013 --> 20:37.163
Hi there, hon.

20:37.613 --> 20:40.173
I thought I told you to go.

20:40.853 --> 20:42.491
- It's about that deal.
- So go!

20:42.653 --> 20:44.052
You've been thinking about it?

20:44.213 --> 20:48.809
Nothing has been further from my mind
with the possible exception of you.

21:00.533 --> 21:02.285
Hey, toro.

21:02.453 --> 21:05.968
Hey, toro. Hey, hey, toro.

21:06.413 --> 21:08.051
Lope!

21:09.813 --> 21:11.883
Hey, hey, toro.

21:43.573 --> 21:45.484
Tuck!

21:47.773 --> 21:50.765
Darling, are you all right?

21:57.093 --> 22:00.085
Cut it out, Tuck, if you want me
to get on with the repairs.

22:00.253 --> 22:02.892
You know it's not easy
for me to keep still with you...

22:03.053 --> 22:05.328
...hanging around me like that.

22:06.613 --> 22:08.922
Who was that fella
jumped the bull, anyway?

22:09.093 --> 22:11.209
- Oh, Carlos.
- I'm glad he was there.

22:11.373 --> 22:14.171
- He saved your life.
- Yeah.

22:16.533 --> 22:21.368
Why did you walk out on me, Tuck?
I was ready to sell out, to marry you.

22:21.533 --> 22:24.001
That's all I ever wanted.

22:25.853 --> 22:27.844
I don't know.

22:28.773 --> 22:30.889
I know I didn't want to.

22:31.053 --> 22:34.125
Getting married is like
being a horse tied up in a corral.

22:34.293 --> 22:37.365
I never could take being
all roped up like that.

22:39.813 --> 22:41.883
T.J., you know what?

22:42.053 --> 22:45.807
I just know you're gonna sell me Omar.

22:47.093 --> 22:50.369
That's right. You've got a deal.

22:50.533 --> 22:52.808
Wait a minute. What's going on?

22:53.093 --> 22:55.243
Nothing. Anything for you, baby.

22:55.693 --> 22:58.810
Don't give me any of that "baby" stuff.
What's the pitch?

22:58.973 --> 23:01.806
- Carlos brought me a new act.
- What kind of an act?

23:02.253 --> 23:07.088
- Stick around. Come to the opening at...
- No, no, I mean now.

23:08.693 --> 23:11.446
All right, I'll show you tonight.

23:11.613 --> 23:15.083
But first the patient must rest,
or he might have a relapse.

23:15.253 --> 23:17.847
- And relapses can be fatal.
- T.J., I want to know...

23:18.013 --> 23:20.527
Now lie still.

23:20.693 --> 23:23.412
Doesn't it hurt to move?

23:24.733 --> 23:26.610
Terrible.

23:36.973 --> 23:39.806
Meet El Diablo.

23:56.013 --> 23:59.085
Well, if that don't beat all.

24:02.693 --> 24:05.571
You want a little sugar, don't you?

24:10.453 --> 24:13.570
- Where'd you ever get a critter like that?
- Carlos found him.

24:14.133 --> 24:17.569
Must have been in a gold mine,
because that's what he is. Solid gold.

24:17.933 --> 24:21.289
It took a while to train him, but now
he's about ready for his debut.

24:21.453 --> 24:23.569
Well, what's the act?

24:28.933 --> 24:33.211
We strap a platform onto Omar's back,
and El Diablo waltzes on top.

24:33.373 --> 24:38.766
A horse dancing on horseback.
That's gonna be a humdinger.

24:46.653 --> 24:52.603
I can see it all now. Presenting El Diablo,
the world's only miniature horse.

24:52.773 --> 24:55.571
We are on our way to a fortune.

24:58.453 --> 25:02.731
- Amazing.
- It's absolutely astounding.

25:02.893 --> 25:06.681
Yeah, it was those three toes
that started me thinking.

25:09.253 --> 25:12.086
And four on its hind feet.

25:13.293 --> 25:16.888
- Great Scott, it could be-
- Yeah, an Eo... What's it?

25:17.053 --> 25:19.931
- Hippus.
- Eohippus. Yes.

25:20.213 --> 25:23.091
Eohippus, if you are one...

25:23.973 --> 25:29.206
...what are you doing here 50 million
years after you should be extinct?

25:31.813 --> 25:34.452
It could be a freak of nature, of course.

25:34.933 --> 25:37.128
Well, is there any way you can tell?

25:37.653 --> 25:39.883
By checking its origin.

25:40.253 --> 25:42.926
If I could prove that this
is the genuine article...

25:43.093 --> 25:45.561
...I shall undoubtedly
receive a knighthood...

25:45.893 --> 25:49.568
...for the greatest scientific
discovery of the age.

25:50.893 --> 25:54.442
The greatest scientific discovery
of the age?

25:55.413 --> 25:59.406
- T.J. Doesn't know what she's got.
- Sir Horace Bromley.

25:59.573 --> 26:01.006
It'll look great in lights.

26:01.173 --> 26:05.803
- Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Bromley.
- Buffalo Bill, Barnum and Bailey.

26:05.973 --> 26:07.964
- Bromley.
- Or the Ringling Brothers.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.601
Yes. Yes. We'll play one off
against the other.

26:10.773 --> 26:13.651
- Sell to the highest bidder. They'll beg.
- Possibly Lord...

26:13.813 --> 26:16.532
- We'd make a killing.
...Bromley.

26:18.333 --> 26:20.893
We must find out where
this little horse came from.

26:21.053 --> 26:24.090
Yes, let's go find this guy Carlos.

26:29.173 --> 26:31.767
- Impossible.
- But my dear fellow...

26:31.933 --> 26:35.846
...I have no commercial interest
in El Diablo. I'm a scientist.

26:36.013 --> 26:40.211
I don't care what you are.
T.J. Has given away our secret.

26:40.373 --> 26:43.604
- Destroying all my dreams.
- Oh, come now, be reasonable.

26:43.773 --> 26:46.162
Reason is something my people
do not understand.

26:46.333 --> 26:50.087
That witch Tia Zorina tells them
superstitious nonsense about El Diablo.

26:50.253 --> 26:52.687
- They believe it.
- At least show us the camp.

26:52.853 --> 26:57.483
I don't want any more trouble.
You've caused enough already.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.525
- Well, thanks for your help, Carlos.
- What help?

27:04.693 --> 27:08.732
"Tia Zorina. Camp."
We can sure find where that camp is.

27:08.893 --> 27:10.770
- How?
- Why, Lope.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.208
- Lope?
- Sure. Listen, that kid...

27:13.373 --> 27:17.161
...could find a needle in a haystack
and sell it for a profit. I'm not kidding.

28:08.373 --> 28:11.729
Madam, I'm prepared to pay
a guide handsomely.

28:11.893 --> 28:17.047
To lead you to the Forbidden Valley?
No. Not for all the gold in the world.

28:17.213 --> 28:21.001
- What's this Forbidden Valley?
- From there came the little horse...

28:21.173 --> 28:24.449
...and until he is returned,
a great evil will fall upon us.

28:24.733 --> 28:27.770
- Rubbish!
- I tell you, unless the little horse...

28:27.933 --> 28:31.892
...is returned, we shall all
suffer the curse of hell.

28:32.173 --> 28:36.530
Superstitious claptrap. There's nothing
hocus-pocus about that little horse.

28:36.693 --> 28:40.845
Don't you realize we've discovered
a living specimen of the Eohippus?

28:41.493 --> 28:45.008
- What, that thing really is an Eohippus?
- Of course.

28:45.173 --> 28:51.169
Well, naturally we shall have
to prove it by scientific research.

28:51.893 --> 28:55.852
Well, we aren't getting any scientific
research done here, are we, professor?

29:08.933 --> 29:13.768
If you can't help me,
perhaps I can help you.

29:14.133 --> 29:18.684
If you knew where the little horse
was hidden, what would you do?

29:18.853 --> 29:22.289
Return it to the Forbidden Valley.

29:25.853 --> 29:27.889
Well...

29:30.293 --> 29:33.251
A centavo for your thoughts, señor.

29:33.653 --> 29:35.689
Oh, hi, Lope.

29:37.893 --> 29:39.724
You look unhappy, señor.

29:39.893 --> 29:43.488
Well, I got a problem, Lope.
I've been wrestling with it for hours.

29:43.653 --> 29:47.009
Sometimes it helps to tell an amigo.

29:48.373 --> 29:51.649
Well, it's like this, amigo:
I made a big discovery last night.

29:51.813 --> 29:54.611
If I tell this friend about it,
it could help her a lot.

29:54.773 --> 29:56.445
She could make a fortune.

29:57.333 --> 30:00.450
But if she makes a fortune
it might not help me.

30:00.773 --> 30:04.448
I can't figure out why I'm trying
to help a friend make a fortune...

30:04.613 --> 30:08.845
...when all I gotta do is be quiet
about it and make a fortune myself.

30:09.013 --> 30:11.083
- Savvy?
- I savvy very well, señor.

30:12.053 --> 30:13.930
- I can't understand it.
- Love.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.443
No! Love's for Latins.

30:16.613 --> 30:18.763
When my mama was alive
she used to tell me:

30:18.933 --> 30:22.926
"Lope, when you help someone
you love you help yourself."

30:24.053 --> 30:27.489
Here, limonada, for free advice.

30:29.333 --> 30:31.483
You sure do know how
to help yourself, Lope.

30:31.653 --> 30:33.450
What's the big discovery, señor?

30:33.613 --> 30:35.968
Oh, no, no, no.
You'll end up wanting a cut.

30:36.133 --> 30:37.771
Why? I'm doing fine on my own.

30:37.933 --> 30:40.083
Yeah, I see, and widening your horizons.

30:40.253 --> 30:43.086
- Sorry, señor?
- I mean, you're going on a journey.

30:43.653 --> 30:46.121
- With the professor.
- With the professor?

30:46.613 --> 30:51.004
I must meet him tonight with the mule,
outside the arena.

30:52.613 --> 30:55.491
Well, that's it, amigo.
No more figuring.

30:55.653 --> 30:59.692
I got the feeling that a friend of mine
is in need of some help right now.

32:26.053 --> 32:28.203
Come on, come on!

32:28.373 --> 32:31.365
- Hey, Tuck!
- Tuck, what's the hurry?

32:32.773 --> 32:35.492
Lope, come here.

32:41.973 --> 32:44.851
We are in luck, chico.
They've got it.

32:48.093 --> 32:51.642
Kirby, let them go! Don't be a fool, man!

32:51.813 --> 32:53.963
Come on, chico,
we mustn't lose them.

32:55.813 --> 32:57.485
What happened?

32:57.653 --> 33:00.451
- He hit me.
- Who?

33:00.613 --> 33:02.763
- Your friend, Kirby.
- What?

33:02.933 --> 33:05.572
I caught him with my people
stealing El Diablo.

33:05.733 --> 33:10.363
- Stealing?! Why, the dirty...
- No, no. Not Tuck.

33:10.533 --> 33:15.004
- We just saw him with our own eyes.
- He's no good, T.J.

33:15.733 --> 33:17.564
Champ, get Bean and Rowdy.

33:17.733 --> 33:19.963
You bet.

34:00.773 --> 34:02.604
Whoa!

34:08.693 --> 34:10.364
Come on!

34:45.092 --> 34:46.606
Look here.

34:46.773 --> 34:50.652
Tuck's got company.
We're headed in the right direction.

34:50.813 --> 34:54.601
He's working with the professor.
They were speaking of scientific interest.

34:54.773 --> 34:58.527
Scientific interest, my eye!
Tuck wants El Diablo for Buffalo Bill.

34:58.693 --> 35:01.651
- You should have listened to me, T.J.
- He's right, T.J.

35:01.813 --> 35:03.246
That Tuck is the lowest.

35:03.413 --> 35:06.291
All right, all right!
He was right. I was wrong.

35:06.453 --> 35:10.207
- If we stand here we'll never catch him.
- I know where they're heading.

35:10.373 --> 35:12.045
- There's a shortcut.
- To where?

35:12.213 --> 35:14.602
Forbidden Valley.

36:06.613 --> 36:08.046
Help!

36:08.213 --> 36:10.283
Now, professor,
where's that little horse?

36:10.453 --> 36:13.809
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

36:13.973 --> 36:17.932
Sir Horace, when your king finds out
you're a low-down horse thief...

36:18.093 --> 36:22.450
...he'll give you a touch of the sword,
all right. Yeah, just about there.

36:23.093 --> 36:25.129
You're gonna tell me where El Diablo is.

36:25.293 --> 36:28.046
You can make it easy or hard.
That's up to you.

36:28.213 --> 36:32.206
- Well, the gypsies took him.
- You put them up to it.

36:32.373 --> 36:35.524
Well, yes, in a way,
but it's going to benefit all of us.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.172
Oh, now, is that a fact?

36:37.333 --> 36:40.962
- El Diablo...
- Is the property of Miss Breckenridge!

36:41.253 --> 36:43.403
I'm protecting her interests.

36:43.573 --> 36:45.962
Well, so am I.

36:46.133 --> 36:51.253
Don't you see, we must follow
the gypsy trail to the Forbidden Valley.

36:51.413 --> 36:53.927
Where there is one Eohippus,
there must be others.

36:54.293 --> 36:57.569
At least two, the sire and the mare.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.283
Possibly more.

37:00.773 --> 37:03.571
Just think what you
and Miss Breckenridge could do...

37:03.733 --> 37:07.646
...with a dozen Eohippi.

37:09.893 --> 37:12.930
From now on we're partners?

37:13.253 --> 37:17.166
Oh, no, professor. I make it a rule never
to shake hands with an anxious man.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.403
I'll join you, but no deals.

37:19.573 --> 37:23.168
- Señor Kirby!
- Hey, hi there, Lope.

37:24.293 --> 37:26.602
Say, what's the price of water
around here?

37:26.773 --> 37:31.005
- One peso. To you, half.
- Okay.

37:49.973 --> 37:53.807
Fly, little one. Fly home to your master.

38:09.013 --> 38:13.723
This circle of mountains,
jagged peaks, deep cliffs...

38:13.893 --> 38:17.568
...could be the perfect barrier
against man and the elements.

38:17.893 --> 38:20.361
Huh, no wonder they call it
the Forbidden Valley.

38:20.533 --> 38:22.205
Yes.

38:22.373 --> 38:24.204
Might be the answer to many things.

38:24.773 --> 38:26.525
Like what?

38:26.693 --> 38:29.651
We shall soon see, Mr. Kirby.

38:30.133 --> 38:33.284
We'll camp here tonight,
start out first thing in the morning.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.765
What's that?

38:37.893 --> 38:39.884
Quick, the horses!

38:43.653 --> 38:48.522
- Where's Rosita?
- Señor Kirby, professor, look!

38:59.413 --> 39:01.722
There's blood all around.

39:10.453 --> 39:13.411
Ho! Ho, boy, ho!

39:20.773 --> 39:24.448
Yeah, the gypsies stopped here,
let El Diablo run off that way.

39:24.613 --> 39:27.491
Señor Kirby! Professor!

39:41.653 --> 39:43.245
Now, how'd they get here?

39:43.413 --> 39:46.052
I was afraid of something like this.

39:46.853 --> 39:49.242
Champ, I just caught myself
a horse thief.

39:49.413 --> 39:53.088
Now hold on, T.J. You don't think
I had anything to do with that?

39:53.253 --> 39:56.529
Look, the Eohippus!

39:59.573 --> 40:02.849
Easy. Easy. Steady.

40:14.533 --> 40:16.967
No, that's no good.
Let's chase him on horseback.

40:17.133 --> 40:18.851
Go get him.

40:44.453 --> 40:47.650
- Hey, need any help?
- Not from you.

40:57.413 --> 41:00.132
- I've got it!
- Take your thieving hands off him.

41:00.293 --> 41:01.965
He's mine.

41:02.133 --> 41:04.931
Whatever you say, T.J.

41:07.573 --> 41:10.690
Tuck Kirby, I could shoot you.

41:15.333 --> 41:17.893
Keep after him, Champ.

41:34.053 --> 41:35.725
Hey, we got him cornered.

41:35.893 --> 41:38.043
The devil we have.

41:44.853 --> 41:46.366
I can see daylight in there.

41:46.533 --> 41:48.364
He must have gone clear through.

41:48.533 --> 41:52.526
Yeah, that's that because we're not.
Looks like the end of the road.

42:25.973 --> 42:28.362
It opens into another whole valley
through there.

42:28.533 --> 42:31.491
Wider inside. Wide enough
for the horses.

42:32.373 --> 42:34.728
Take up the slack easy.

42:42.333 --> 42:44.210
Take her away.

42:51.013 --> 42:53.163
Okay, that did it!

43:02.933 --> 43:05.003
Come on, boys.

44:00.613 --> 44:02.843
Now, ain't that something?!

44:03.013 --> 44:05.402
Man, oh, man!

44:44.533 --> 44:46.444
Champ!

47:14.933 --> 47:18.209
Whoa. Here, what's this?

47:21.333 --> 47:23.893
- I never saw tracks like that.
- Hey, Champ!

47:24.053 --> 47:26.123
Do you see what I see?

47:27.493 --> 47:30.929
Holy... What's that?

47:31.093 --> 47:33.402
It looks like a plucked ostrich!

47:37.413 --> 47:39.881
Let's get him for the show.

48:28.613 --> 48:30.285
What the...?

48:37.013 --> 48:40.289
- I'm gonna try and find the others.
- Right.

48:40.613 --> 48:43.081
- It's hideous.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

48:43.253 --> 48:45.972
- What kind of bird is it, professor?
- Oh, no bird.

48:46.133 --> 48:48.772
A giant pterodactyl, a flying reptile.

48:48.933 --> 48:52.130
It's been extinct
for over 50 million years.

48:52.293 --> 48:54.523
Then what's it doing here?

48:54.693 --> 48:57.002
Precisely.

48:57.173 --> 48:59.733
What is it doing here?

49:02.853 --> 49:04.366
- Where are the others?
- There!

49:04.533 --> 49:06.205
Let's get out of here!

49:07.893 --> 49:09.963
Gwangi.

49:12.293 --> 49:15.171
- Take off, T.J.
- Lope's hurt.

49:15.333 --> 49:17.972
Can you ride? Get on a horse, boy!

49:18.133 --> 49:21.409
- Come on, professor. No time for that.
- I can't go now.

49:21.573 --> 49:24.690
There's a big lizard back there,
heading this way. Get aboard.

49:24.853 --> 49:28.050
Leave me alone, Mr. Kirby.
I'm not leaving now.

49:28.213 --> 49:30.124
Come on, Tuck.

49:30.293 --> 49:33.091
Okay, professor, it's your funeral.

49:41.413 --> 49:44.052
Great Scott!

49:44.613 --> 49:48.652
I see what you mean, Mr. Kirby.

50:51.253 --> 50:55.371
By George! A styracosaurus!

51:55.093 --> 51:56.845
Whoa!

51:59.653 --> 52:01.883
All right, Champ, take a look.

52:21.253 --> 52:24.131
Okay up here. Room for the horses
and everything.

52:24.293 --> 52:27.091
- Let's get up there.
- What about the professor?

52:27.253 --> 52:30.450
Nothing we can do for him now.
Just hope he's still alive.

52:48.613 --> 52:50.763
Rowdy, you must be plumb loco.

52:50.933 --> 52:53.401
- Now what'd I do?
- Come here.

52:53.573 --> 52:57.009
These cartridges are blanks.
They're the blanks we use in the show.

52:57.173 --> 52:59.641
No wonder the rifles didn't do any good.

52:59.813 --> 53:03.249
How was I to know? You expect
to wake a fella ready for a shootout?

53:03.413 --> 53:05.005
Hey, forget it.

53:05.173 --> 53:07.004
Here, maybe we can use these.

53:07.173 --> 53:11.963
- See if you can cut that into a spear.
- I don't take orders from no horse thief.

53:15.573 --> 53:18.929
All right, now tell me, just what
do you mean, a horse thief?

53:19.093 --> 53:20.287
All right, break it up.

53:20.453 --> 53:22.683
That's enough.
We'll settle all this later.

53:22.853 --> 53:25.083
No, we'll settle it right now. Lope?

53:25.253 --> 53:28.768
It was the professor and the gypsies.

53:29.813 --> 53:32.122
Carlos said you did it.

53:33.733 --> 53:35.564
Carlos?

53:36.173 --> 53:39.563
You never did bring anything
but trouble to T.J. All right.

53:39.973 --> 53:44.205
Stop it! Where do you think you are,
civilization?

53:44.373 --> 53:47.570
We all got to stick together
until we get out of this.

53:49.733 --> 53:52.850
In all my travels I never saw
nothing like that 2-ton lizard.

53:53.013 --> 53:54.810
If we could just get him back alive.

53:54.973 --> 53:57.965
Yeah, the only thing I want
to get back alive is me.

53:59.173 --> 54:00.765
That does it.

54:05.893 --> 54:09.203
What are you doing out of the cave?
You wanna get yourself killed?

54:09.373 --> 54:11.409
Not anymore.

54:11.973 --> 54:15.648
- What's that for?
- Well, it's a trap.

54:15.813 --> 54:19.806
In case one of those little lizards
decides to mosey up this way.

54:21.013 --> 54:24.210
A hole in the ground
could swallow me up too.

54:24.373 --> 54:28.525
You can't tell a friend from an enemy,
cockeyed female.

54:32.053 --> 54:34.521
Don't they sleep nights?

54:35.813 --> 54:38.043
Come on! Come on!

54:45.893 --> 54:49.408
- It's gone.
- Yeah, temporarily.

54:50.133 --> 54:52.283
Tuck, I've decided.
I'm going to sell out.

54:52.453 --> 54:54.921
Well, that's great,
if we ever get back to Omar.

54:55.093 --> 54:59.564
Not just Omar. The whole show,
lock, stock and barrel.

54:59.973 --> 55:02.533
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

55:03.173 --> 55:06.245
- Well, sure, sure.
- Oh, sound happier.

55:08.053 --> 55:11.568
Well, I don't know, T.J.
I've been on my own so long.

55:11.733 --> 55:13.246
I've been on my own too.

55:13.413 --> 55:16.769
Well, I know, I know, but not like me.
I mean, really on my own.

55:16.933 --> 55:20.687
I've had to con and pitch,
hustle my way into whatever I am now.

55:20.853 --> 55:22.491
I don't even know where that is.

55:22.653 --> 55:25.406
Tuck, I don't care.
Don't you understand?

55:27.973 --> 55:29.725
All right.

55:29.893 --> 55:32.282
All right, T.J.

55:32.453 --> 55:35.570
I'll tell you. I've been looking
for something...

55:35.733 --> 55:37.485
...all my life.
- Yes?

55:37.653 --> 55:40.451
It took a lot of finding,
but I finally found it.

55:40.613 --> 55:42.683
- Yes?
- The most beautiful...

55:42.853 --> 55:46.209
...galdarndest ranch you ever saw.

55:46.373 --> 55:49.410
- Ranch?
- Yeah, in Wyoming.

55:49.573 --> 55:52.326
Don't you see, we could
both sell out, buy the place...

55:52.493 --> 55:57.009
...build it up to a really big ranch,
raise a bunch of cattle and horses.

55:57.173 --> 55:58.526
And kids, maybe?

55:58.693 --> 56:00.604
Yeah!

56:01.973 --> 56:05.807
You talking about settling down?
Sure you can make it, Tuck?

56:05.973 --> 56:11.491
Well, I won't know
till I give it a try, will I?

56:21.173 --> 56:23.971
Bean, Rowdy, bring torches! It worked!

56:42.293 --> 56:47.970
I say up there, watch your step.
There seems to be a bit of a drop here.

57:04.766 --> 57:08.281
I need some water before we set out.
Be right back.

57:40.326 --> 57:44.239
- You shouldn't have let him go alone.
- His idea.

58:19.566 --> 58:20.999
Come on!

58:26.366 --> 58:28.436
Bean! Rowdy!

58:40.246 --> 58:42.919
Get spears! Get spears!

59:20.046 --> 59:23.004
Get the horses!
Bean, Rowdy, saddle up!

01:00:57.606 --> 01:00:59.085
Got him!

01:01:03.966 --> 01:01:05.922
Go to the other side!

01:01:10.446 --> 01:01:12.164
Pull on the rope! Pull!

01:01:19.086 --> 01:01:21.316
Pull that rope!

01:01:27.246 --> 01:01:28.804
Go on, get clear!
Get clear!

01:01:55.326 --> 01:01:58.762
Pull that rope! Get clear!

01:02:08.686 --> 01:02:12.918
Pull on that rope! All the way!

01:02:13.766 --> 01:02:17.202
Pull it!
Get another rope on him!

01:02:27.966 --> 01:02:30.400
Pull that rope!
Hold on!

01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:40.837
Another rope should do it!

01:02:42.286 --> 01:02:44.117
Hold it steady!

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:47.885
Hold him! Hold him!

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:58.766
They've got him, professor!
They've got him!

01:03:17.566 --> 01:03:19.477
Steady now, steady!

01:03:22.246 --> 01:03:24.965
Keep the ropes tight!
Keep them tight!

01:03:27.566 --> 01:03:30.364
Come on, professor!
Come on!

01:03:44.366 --> 01:03:46.596
The ropes, keep them tight!

01:04:17.806 --> 01:04:22.596
All right, clear out! Let go!
Rowdy, come on!

01:04:33.366 --> 01:04:35.755
Steady those horses!

01:04:46.086 --> 01:04:48.042
Can't get through!

01:05:07.326 --> 01:05:09.282
Keep those horses steady!

01:05:21.806 --> 01:05:22.921
Tuck, Carlos!

01:05:35.406 --> 01:05:40.321
Can't get through here!
Go back to the professor.

01:05:59.366 --> 01:06:02.597
There's no way through!
There's no way through!

01:06:02.766 --> 01:06:04.961
We gotta go back!

01:08:43.845 --> 01:08:46.439
We're gonna lug this critter back alive!

01:08:46.606 --> 01:08:51.805
T.J., you're gonna have the greatest
main attraction that any circus...

01:08:53.326 --> 01:08:55.078
What's the matter?

01:08:59.046 --> 01:09:00.638
Where's Carlos?

01:10:27.766 --> 01:10:29.199
Champ!

01:10:43.646 --> 01:10:45.796
It is as I foretold.

01:10:46.046 --> 01:10:51.200
Gwangi has killed Carlos
just as he killed his brother Miguel.

01:10:51.726 --> 01:10:54.877
- Well, how'd you know that?
- In a dream, I saw it.

01:10:55.046 --> 01:10:59.597
The great jaws snapping,
the riderless horse. He was doomed.

01:10:59.766 --> 01:11:02.439
And so will you be doomed,
all of you...

01:11:02.606 --> 01:11:04.836
...unless the evil one is set free!

01:11:05.006 --> 01:11:10.285
Balderdash, my good woman
He's no more evil than an alligator.

01:11:10.686 --> 01:11:13.803
The only thing that's evil about him
are his jaws.

01:11:13.966 --> 01:11:17.481
Spells? He can cast no spells!

01:11:18.286 --> 01:11:21.005
All right, come on, let's move out.

01:11:25.486 --> 01:11:28.239
Defy the law and perish!

01:12:14.766 --> 01:12:18.645
In the name of world science,
I beg you, I implore you, to think again.

01:12:18.806 --> 01:12:24.199
- Later. We've got a show to put on.
- A show! A show?

01:12:24.366 --> 01:12:30.236
It's disgraceful to think of putting this
creature on display in a cheap circus!

01:12:30.406 --> 01:12:34.240
- We can do what we like. He's ours.
- He belongs to us all, to mankind.

01:12:34.406 --> 01:12:36.681
- To scientific research!
- Easy, professor.

01:12:36.846 --> 01:12:41.761
You can do your research in the time we
give you. Follow us on our world tour!

01:12:41.926 --> 01:12:46.283
You must be mad, raving mad.
World tour!

01:12:46.446 --> 01:12:49.802
We'll see what the Royal Society
has to say about this.

01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:55.358
- What's this about a world tour?
- I've got it all figured out.

01:12:55.526 --> 01:12:58.518
- We play London, Paris, Madrid, and...
- Wait a minute.

01:12:58.686 --> 01:13:01.484
- Forgetting something, aren't you?
- Oh, yes, New York.

01:13:01.646 --> 01:13:04.638
No, not New York, Wyoming!
That ranch!

01:13:04.806 --> 01:13:07.718
- We talked about it, remember?
- Yes, but that was before.

01:13:07.886 --> 01:13:10.639
Look, T.J., this show
was going to be it.

01:13:10.806 --> 01:13:15.038
The reason I helped you was so that
all of you could get paid off handsome.

01:13:15.206 --> 01:13:18.915
- From a show that's really worth buying.
- But now it's worth saving.

01:13:19.086 --> 01:13:22.123
Tuck, can't you see?
We can do the tour, then buy the ranch.

01:13:22.286 --> 01:13:25.323
No. No, we can't.
Not you and me. Not now.

01:13:25.486 --> 01:13:30.037
- Same old Tuck.
- Oh, no, not the same old Tuck!

01:13:30.206 --> 01:13:33.482
But a new kind of T.J.,
suddenly caught up in a world of glitter.

01:13:33.646 --> 01:13:36.922
Leave me out. That dreamboat's
on the rocks before it sails.

01:13:37.086 --> 01:13:39.122
As you like.

01:13:40.046 --> 01:13:42.116
As you like?!

01:13:42.926 --> 01:13:46.601
- Well, that's it.
- I guess it is.

01:13:49.606 --> 01:13:51.324
Figures.

01:13:51.846 --> 01:13:55.236
Well, I'm sorry for you.
You're heading for a place I just left.

01:13:55.406 --> 01:13:59.001
I know that place.
I don't think you're gonna like it much.

01:14:05.086 --> 01:14:07.759
Señorita, you must go after Mr. Kirby.

01:14:07.926 --> 01:14:11.714
He's a very proud man
and he'll never come back.

01:15:00.446 --> 01:15:01.925
Tuck!

01:16:27.086 --> 01:16:28.599
Quiet him down!
Quiet him down!

01:16:28.766 --> 01:16:31.234
Please, señor,
I'm doing the best I can!

01:16:35.006 --> 01:16:37.474
Pedro, ready with that fanfare music.

01:16:41.566 --> 01:16:46.242
Stand by, boys. When that goes up
you'll get the picture of your lives.

01:16:58.446 --> 01:17:01.722
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:17:03.566 --> 01:17:05.682
I have the honor...

01:17:05.846 --> 01:17:09.555
...to make the most important
announcement of this...

01:17:13.526 --> 01:17:17.485
To make the most important
announcement of the era!

01:17:18.086 --> 01:17:23.240
What you are about to see
has never been seen before, I repeat...

01:17:23.886 --> 01:17:28.038
...has never been seen before
by human eyes!

01:17:28.206 --> 01:17:31.243
Captured and brought back alive...

01:17:31.406 --> 01:17:34.921
...by Miss T.J. Breckenridge!

01:17:36.726 --> 01:17:39.001
Let her rip, boys.
Let her rip!

01:17:42.926 --> 01:17:45.156
Gwangi the Great!

01:17:45.326 --> 01:17:49.956
Living wonder of the prehistoric era!

01:17:55.166 --> 01:17:58.795
Get that curtain down!
Can you get that curtain down?

01:18:34.206 --> 01:18:35.685
Stop him!

01:18:44.246 --> 01:18:47.044
What is happening?
No, you're supposed to play!

01:19:18.806 --> 01:19:21.525
- Champ! I know what's happened.
- Gwangi's loose!

01:19:21.686 --> 01:19:23.517
Well, get some rifles!

01:23:20.286 --> 01:23:21.639
The doors! The doors!

01:23:37.206 --> 01:23:38.958
Lope!

01:23:48.366 --> 01:23:50.004
Get in there!

01:23:51.246 --> 01:23:52.645
Push!

01:24:36.326 --> 01:24:39.318
Quick, out the back way!
I'll try and lock him in.

01:25:42.446 --> 01:25:45.119
- This door's barred from the inside!
- The other is too!

01:25:45.286 --> 01:25:46.685
We've gotta get in there!

01:27:14.086 --> 01:27:16.042
Come on!

01:27:16.686 --> 01:27:17.755
Go!
