02:14.886 --> 02:16.304
Tommy?

02:19.224 --> 02:21.768
Tommy, are you awake?

02:24.563 --> 02:26.690
I saw your missing boat outside.

02:29.276 --> 02:30.694
I'm gonna get it for you.

02:33.530 --> 02:35.949
Mrs. Summers?

02:36.032 --> 02:37.993
Are you sure I should go?

02:38.076 --> 02:39.744
I don't mind staying.

02:39.828 --> 02:41.746
No, it's fine. You should go home.

02:42.414 --> 02:44.040
I'll check on the kids later.

02:44.124 --> 02:45.876
Okay, Mrs. Summers.

02:46.001 --> 02:47.335
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:08.315 --> 03:09.649
There you are.

04:03.036 --> 04:04.246
Rebecca?

04:05.497 --> 04:06.581
What are you doing?

04:18.593 --> 04:19.886
Sorry, Mom.

04:19.970 --> 04:21.346
I didn't mean...

04:26.935 --> 04:28.228
Mom?

05:24.117 --> 05:26.244
<i>Temagami. Temagami.</i>

05:26.369 --> 05:28.747
<i>Temagami. Temagami...</i>

05:32.167 --> 05:34.628
Mom! Mom! Mom!

05:34.711 --> 05:36.254
Help!

06:00.737 --> 06:03.406
<i>Brewers played
extra innings with the Marlins yesterday.</i>

06:03.490 --> 06:04.491
<i>They fell in 12.</i>

06:04.574 --> 06:08.078
<i>One-one. Foul ball up the first baseline,
and it is two strikes.</i>

06:08.662 --> 06:12.123
<i>Brewers are eight and nine
in extra-inning games so far this season.</i>

06:12.249 --> 06:13.708
<i>Hoping to keep that streak alive.</i>

06:14.834 --> 06:16.378
Ray,  they're ready for us.

06:24.344 --> 06:25.637
Dad.

06:26.221 --> 06:27.430
You okay?

06:28.515 --> 06:31.226
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

06:31.309 --> 06:33.520
Give me a head start.
I'll meet you inside.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.111
This has got every single thing
that you asked for.

06:41.194 --> 06:43.446
It has 24-hour emergency call service.

06:44.072 --> 06:45.824
Right? Which is great.

06:45.907 --> 06:48.577
It's got single-level bedrooms.

06:48.660 --> 06:51.037
It's got bath...
All the bathrooms have handrails.

06:51.121 --> 06:52.914
And you're just minutes away

06:52.998 --> 06:55.834
from one of the best medical facilities
in the Twin Cities.

06:55.917 --> 06:56.918
Yeah.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.837
It's... I mean,
it's really kind of perfect lease

06:58.920 --> 07:00.755
for when you just need
a little extra help.

07:01.548 --> 07:02.883
Do you not like it?

07:02.966 --> 07:04.885
- Well, it's nice.
Are you... Are you looking

07:04.968 --> 07:06.720
for a place to throw the ball around?

07:07.929 --> 07:09.681
Is there any chance
that you're gonna bring

07:09.806 --> 07:12.517
that Waller swing here
once you get better?

07:14.603 --> 07:16.479
I'm sorry. I Google all my clients,

07:16.563 --> 07:18.732
and it's just not every day
that I get a...

07:18.815 --> 07:20.275
A big-league third baseman.

07:20.358 --> 07:21.818
Yeah, no. I, um...

07:22.444 --> 07:24.279
I'm just focused on getting better now

07:24.362 --> 07:25.864
and spending some time at home

07:25.947 --> 07:27.324
- and being with family.
- Well, you know what?

07:27.407 --> 07:29.868
You can spend some of that
baseball money right here.

07:29.951 --> 07:32.662
You can't put a price on peace of mind.

07:32.787 --> 07:35.332
Yeah. Yeah, well,
apparently, here you can.

07:35.457 --> 07:37.042
It's 4,200 bucks.

07:37.167 --> 07:40.420
Oh, just... You know what? In the kitchen.
Come here. I want to show you.

07:40.503 --> 07:41.963
There's this accessible design.

07:42.047 --> 07:44.633
And I don't know who did it,
but I think I want one myself.

07:44.716 --> 07:45.967
- I'll tell you that much.
You guys like it or...

07:46.051 --> 07:47.552
Yeah.
I might be your neighbor.

08:23.964 --> 08:25.423
Wait, wait. Honey, honey.

08:25.507 --> 08:26.758
- Wait, stop, stop.
- What?

08:26.841 --> 08:28.677
Honey, stop, stop, stop. Look.

08:28.760 --> 08:30.303
Look. Look.

08:32.471 --> 08:33.723
Huh.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.725
I would've shown you this place,

08:35.809 --> 08:37.726
but it didn't really meet your checklist.

08:37.811 --> 08:39.854
- And this is not a rental, right?
- I know.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.773
- We were just curious.
- Okay.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.818
Right, well, it's only one owner
for the last couple decades.

08:44.901 --> 08:48.321
And, uh, you know,
it needs just a little work, I think.

08:48.405 --> 08:51.157
But it's not gonna be on the market
very long at this price.

08:51.283 --> 08:54.703
Oh, and you're in a great school district
with Harold Holt.

08:54.786 --> 08:56.121
That's where I start in the fall.

08:56.204 --> 08:58.456
No, really? Oh, I'm a proud alum myself.

08:58.540 --> 08:59.624
Go, Lake Trout.

09:01.585 --> 09:03.503
And what subject do you teach there?

09:03.628 --> 09:05.297
Oh, no. I'm just in the admin office

09:05.422 --> 09:08.258
while I finish my degree online
for special education.

09:09.342 --> 09:11.344
Oh. Good for you. Good for you.

09:11.428 --> 09:13.638
Well, it's never too late
to follow your dream.

09:14.222 --> 09:17.100
Too awesome.

09:17.642 --> 09:18.685
Yeah.

09:18.768 --> 09:21.771
Oh, my gosh. This is amazing.

09:21.897 --> 09:24.107
- What is that? The fruit baskets.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.318
Where did Ray get off to?

09:26.443 --> 09:27.652
I didn't see him.

09:29.863 --> 09:31.239
There you are.

09:31.364 --> 09:32.866
Hey.

09:32.949 --> 09:34.367
There's a pool.

09:37.203 --> 09:38.872
I used to be scared of pools.

09:40.665 --> 09:43.501
My dad pushed me
into one of the training tanks

09:43.585 --> 09:45.545
at Fort Benning when I was three.

09:45.629 --> 09:46.755
Mm-hmm.

09:46.838 --> 09:48.506
Sink or swim.

09:48.590 --> 09:50.091
I guess I swam.

09:52.177 --> 09:53.511
I always wanted a pool.

09:54.679 --> 09:56.806
When we were kids,
we used to go down the street,

09:56.890 --> 09:59.184
break into the KOA, go swimming.

09:59.351 --> 10:02.270
We used to pretend that
we were the rich kids from the suburbs.

10:03.897 --> 10:05.690
Hey, Mom, can we get lunch?

10:05.774 --> 10:07.859
Yeah, I'm ready to go.
Can we get some food?

10:07.943 --> 10:09.110
Come on, old man.

10:10.028 --> 10:11.571
Before we get too nostalgic.

10:45.021 --> 10:47.566
<i>Familiar face
makes his way down to the plate.</i>

10:47.649 --> 10:49.526
<i>What a story this has been, folks.</i>

10:50.026 --> 10:51.778
<i>After a year battling illness,</i>

10:51.861 --> 10:53.780
<i>Ray Waller is trying to do the impossible</i>

10:53.863 --> 10:55.824
<i>with a Major League comeback.</i>

10:57.534 --> 10:58.577
<i>Glider inside.</i>

10:58.660 --> 10:59.869
<i>Waller digs for it...</i>

11:01.329 --> 11:03.081
<i>- and connects!</i>

11:03.164 --> 11:05.208
<i>It's a deep ball into far center field,</i>

11:05.292 --> 11:06.960
<i>and it is gone!</i>

11:21.766 --> 11:22.934
Dad!

11:23.059 --> 11:24.978
Mom, hurry! Dad fell in!

11:26.563 --> 11:28.815
Ray, what happened? Are you okay?

11:28.899 --> 11:30.567
- Dad? What happened?
Yeah.

11:30.650 --> 11:31.735
Mom, is he okay?

11:31.818 --> 11:33.737
- Just breathe. It's okay.
-  I'm fine.

11:33.820 --> 11:35.280
- Mom, his cane.
- Yep.

11:35.363 --> 11:37.616
- Izzy, give me... Help me here.
- Yep.

11:37.699 --> 11:38.992
- Yeah.
You got it?

11:39.492 --> 11:40.660
Okay.

11:42.704 --> 11:43.747
- You got it?
Okay.

11:43.872 --> 11:45.832
Yeah?
Yeah. Okay.

11:55.217 --> 11:58.011
How long has it been
since your last episode?

11:58.094 --> 11:59.971
Well, it wasn't really an episode,

12:00.055 --> 12:01.348
- I don't think. It's like...

12:01.473 --> 12:03.308
At spring training about six months ago.

12:03.808 --> 12:08.355
My recommendation
is to escalate the diagnosis

12:08.438 --> 12:11.024
to secondary progressive MS.

12:11.107 --> 12:13.693
No, but the doctor said he was stabilizing

12:13.777 --> 12:16.196
and that it's about managing now.

12:16.279 --> 12:19.115
It's better to have
a more accurate diagnosis.

12:19.616 --> 12:20.992
- Are you in PT?
- No...

12:21.076 --> 12:23.370
Um, well, I mean,
I'm throwing the ball around

12:23.453 --> 12:25.163
in the front yard with the kids,
and, like, that.

12:25.247 --> 12:27.958
We just got insurance
through the school where I'm working.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.501
Yeah.
- Forget baseball.

12:29.584 --> 12:32.837
For now, we need to find
a low-impact activity

12:32.921 --> 12:34.297
that you can do every day.

12:34.381 --> 12:36.466
Walking, yoga.

12:36.550 --> 12:39.386
Most therapists recommend swimming.

12:39.469 --> 12:41.721
Look, I know it feels like
your whole world

12:41.805 --> 12:43.265
is turning upside down.

12:44.391 --> 12:46.851
It's going to take sacrifice
from you both,

12:46.935 --> 12:49.229
but you can build a good life together.

12:49.312 --> 12:51.815
First, you have to let go of the old one.

12:53.358 --> 12:56.486
Use the wheelchair for the next few days
while you regulate,

12:56.570 --> 12:58.738
and I will bring you back in next week.

13:03.577 --> 13:06.830
Honey, if we rent that townhome,
it'd be like living in a hospital.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.085
I don't want to be the sick guy anymore.

13:12.168 --> 13:13.378
But you're sick, Ray.

13:13.503 --> 13:15.255
- We need to deal with that head-on.
- I know. I just don't want it

13:15.338 --> 13:17.257
to define our whole life now.

13:19.593 --> 13:21.219
What about that other house?

13:22.053 --> 13:25.056
The kids will love it, with all that room.

13:25.140 --> 13:26.182
And with a swimming pool,

13:26.266 --> 13:29.185
we'll have water therapy
in our own backyard.

13:40.697 --> 13:42.908
You know I want our own place.

13:43.825 --> 13:46.828
I'm tired of the kids changing schools,

13:46.912 --> 13:49.706
making new friends
every time you get traded.

13:50.624 --> 13:53.877
I want us to put down roots, you know?

13:55.170 --> 13:58.006
I just need to know
that you want that, too.

13:58.089 --> 13:59.090
I do.

14:00.425 --> 14:01.468
Eve.

14:04.721 --> 14:06.223
I want that, too.

14:07.432 --> 14:08.642
I promise.

14:11.686 --> 14:14.189
Also, you know what else
I was wondering about?

14:14.314 --> 14:17.943
Do you have that black bikini still?

14:18.026 --> 14:19.277
You know which one I'm talking about?

14:19.361 --> 14:20.820
- With the crisscross straps?
- Guy's in a hospital.

14:20.904 --> 14:22.364
This is what he's thinking.

14:22.864 --> 14:25.575
<i>This summer I went swimming</i>

14:25.659 --> 14:27.994
<i>This summer I might have drowned</i>

14:28.078 --> 14:30.747
<i>But I held my breath and I kicked my feet</i>

14:30.830 --> 14:33.458
<i>And I moved my arms around</i>

14:33.541 --> 14:34.751
<i>I moved my arms around...</i>

14:34.834 --> 14:37.045
Hey, there you are, Cider.

14:37.128 --> 14:38.421
Come here, buddy.

14:38.922 --> 14:40.382
How do you like our new home?

14:40.465 --> 14:42.842
Isn't it awesome? It's so big, right?

14:42.926 --> 14:45.303
<i>Chlorine my eyes,
I'm a self-destructive fool...</i>

14:45.387 --> 14:46.930
Izzy, I'll see you later.
Okay.

14:47.013 --> 14:48.682
Good luck.
- Thanks.

14:48.765 --> 14:49.808
You got it.
- Yeah.

14:49.891 --> 14:51.685
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

14:51.768 --> 14:53.019
Oh, thanks.

14:53.144 --> 14:55.021
- See you later, dipshit.
See you, barf bag.

14:55.981 --> 14:57.357
Think you're gonna go out this year?

14:57.440 --> 15:00.443
Yeah. Dad says
I'm about to hit my growth spurt.

15:01.820 --> 15:03.446
Actually, wait.

15:04.197 --> 15:06.449
Yeah. I think you're hitting it right now.

15:08.868 --> 15:11.079
Here. Wait, wait. I got it.

15:12.247 --> 15:14.624
<i>The old Australian crawl</i>

15:14.708 --> 15:17.252
<i>This summer I went swimming</i>

15:17.377 --> 15:18.670
<i>This summer I might have drowned...</i>

15:18.753 --> 15:20.505
Hey, how tall are you?

15:21.506 --> 15:22.507
Look, um...

15:22.591 --> 15:24.175
Can you just put your arm up real quick?

15:24.259 --> 15:26.553
Like, yeah. Just like that.

15:26.636 --> 15:27.971
Yeah, you have a great wingspan.

15:29.222 --> 15:30.223
Thanks.

15:30.307 --> 15:31.516
You should come on Friday.

15:32.642 --> 15:34.644
- Okay.
- My name's Ronin.

15:35.186 --> 15:37.939
Hey, you should come on Friday,
for real. It's gonna be dope.

15:39.649 --> 15:42.819
<i>Hey-ee!</i>

15:56.166 --> 15:57.918
Does it smell weird to you guys?

15:58.043 --> 15:59.961
Nah, you're just
turning back into a dog.

16:00.045 --> 16:02.172
Have to take you back to the shelter
where Mom and Dad found you.

16:04.090 --> 16:06.551
What is with the PYX 106 playlist?

16:06.635 --> 16:08.178
I'm bringing back the classics, babe.

16:08.261 --> 16:10.388
I like it, Dad.
Hey, El, I...

16:11.056 --> 16:12.849
I talked with your coach at orientation.

16:12.933 --> 16:16.394
He thought it might be good
if I come and help with practice.

16:16.478 --> 16:18.230
I thought it might be kinda fun, right?

16:18.313 --> 16:19.898
Yeah, Dad. This is my year, right?

16:20.440 --> 16:21.691
Yeah.

16:21.775 --> 16:22.901
It is.

16:23.401 --> 16:25.153
I think I'm going out for the swim team.

16:25.779 --> 16:26.821
Ooh!
Really?

16:26.947 --> 16:28.782
Yeah.
That's great, Iz.

16:28.907 --> 16:30.492
- Yeah, you're gonna be a natural.

16:30.575 --> 16:33.620
That trophy bat, that came alive
the day you were born.

16:33.703 --> 16:34.788
Mm-hmm.

16:34.871 --> 16:38.333
I absolutely launched one into the Bay.

16:38.750 --> 16:39.793
Pop!

16:39.876 --> 16:41.002
Splash.

16:41.086 --> 16:43.797
It was the ninth inning,
and I was at the plate,

16:45.048 --> 16:46.049
and I don't know what it was.

16:46.883 --> 16:49.135
Just this sense of strength came over me.

16:50.053 --> 16:51.471
I knew it.

16:51.555 --> 16:52.931
I knew it right then.

16:53.056 --> 16:54.683
- My Izzy is...

16:55.100 --> 16:56.142
Dad?

16:56.226 --> 16:57.811
- Oh, my gosh.
What happened?

16:57.936 --> 16:59.104
- Ray?
Are you okay?

16:59.229 --> 17:00.689
God, I sliced it pretty good.
- What happened?

17:00.772 --> 17:01.982
- Ah...
- Oh, that looks...

17:02.065 --> 17:03.233
Oh, God.

17:03.942 --> 17:05.610
- Oh, my gosh.
Ew.

17:05.694 --> 17:07.028
- What is that?
Oh, God.

17:07.111 --> 17:08.196
Be careful.

17:09.948 --> 17:11.283
Is that supposed to happen?

17:11.366 --> 17:12.449
I don't think so.

17:13.201 --> 17:14.202
<i>Is it safe?</i>

17:14.285 --> 17:16.454
No pool is absolutely safe.

17:16.538 --> 17:18.039
But you see that cap?

17:18.122 --> 17:19.457
That's a wellhead.

17:20.041 --> 17:24.545
I-I've never seen an actual
spring-fed pool before in person,

17:24.629 --> 17:26.172
but you're tapped into groundwater.

17:26.256 --> 17:27.883
- I'm talking aquiclude.

17:28.008 --> 17:30.385
That's some sublevel aquifer shit.

17:30.468 --> 17:31.887
What does that mean?
- Yeah, what does that mean?

17:31.970 --> 17:33.263
I'm about to tell you what that means.

17:33.388 --> 17:35.599
That means natural filtration,

17:35.682 --> 17:38.602
geothermal heating, the whole shebang.

17:38.727 --> 17:41.479
Yeah, we'll give it a shock,
but these spring pools

17:41.563 --> 17:43.523
are supposed to work miracles
on your skin.

17:43.648 --> 17:45.901
This whole area
had natural pools all around.

17:45.984 --> 17:47.903
Wellness centers, health spas.

17:48.028 --> 17:49.529
That's great. Lucky us, huh?

17:49.654 --> 17:50.780
Yeah.

17:50.864 --> 17:52.741
- It's funny, isn't it, though?
- Uh-huh.

17:52.824 --> 17:54.034
I mean...

17:54.784 --> 17:57.037
We evolved out of the water

17:57.162 --> 17:59.748
and some part of our reptilian brain knows

17:59.873 --> 18:03.168
we're not supposed to be there
anymore, but...

18:03.668 --> 18:06.671
I guess that's why
we try to tame it so hard.

18:08.465 --> 18:10.967
It's like trying to conquer death...

18:11.051 --> 18:12.052
- Whoa, whoa.
Jesus. Be careful.

18:12.135 --> 18:14.554
Are you okay?
- God, sorry.

18:14.679 --> 18:15.764
Butterfingers.

18:16.598 --> 18:17.599
What an idiot.

18:17.682 --> 18:19.434
All right, well, here's your invoice.

18:20.101 --> 18:21.186
I'll come back tomorrow.

18:21.269 --> 18:23.021
You should be set up by next week.

18:23.146 --> 18:24.898
- Okay.
- Great. Thanks.

18:24.981 --> 18:26.566
Hey, Gecko, let's wrap it up.

18:26.650 --> 18:28.193
Come on. Let's boogie, baby.

18:31.863 --> 18:33.823
All right, we're good to go!

18:46.962 --> 18:48.129
Ready?

18:48.213 --> 18:49.214
Yeah.

18:49.297 --> 18:52.425
<i>One life, I'm gonna live it up...</i>

19:03.603 --> 19:05.397
Come on, Dad. Throw some more.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.233
Hold on. I just got to finish
these exercises.

19:09.568 --> 19:10.944
Are you watching this?

19:11.027 --> 19:13.947
The water takes all
the strain off my muscles. It's amazing.

19:14.030 --> 19:15.907
Give me those muscles.

19:19.661 --> 19:20.996
They're all down there.

19:21.121 --> 19:22.455
I'll get 'em all in one breath.

19:23.248 --> 19:25.375
Yeah, sure. Why not? Go.

19:27.335 --> 19:28.587
Are you ready?

19:28.670 --> 19:30.213
You know, this is, um...

19:30.338 --> 19:32.549
It's gonna sound crazy,
but I think that maybe getting sick

19:32.632 --> 19:34.134
happened for a reason, you know?

19:35.385 --> 19:37.262
I don't think
I could've walked away healthy.

19:37.387 --> 19:38.430
Look, right here.

19:39.055 --> 19:41.016
You'll always be a baseball player.

19:41.141 --> 19:42.475
I got it fair and square.

19:42.601 --> 19:43.852
But it's not all you are.

19:45.186 --> 19:47.063
It's not why I fell in love with you.

19:47.188 --> 19:48.773
- No?
- No.

19:49.900 --> 19:51.151
Don't look back.

19:52.277 --> 19:53.486
Remember?

19:53.570 --> 19:54.905
This is all we need.

19:56.239 --> 19:58.158
- Right?
- Yeah.

19:59.576 --> 20:00.827
Yeah.

20:05.498 --> 20:06.750
You know my kiss is magic?

20:06.833 --> 20:07.834
Oh, really?

20:07.918 --> 20:09.544
Yep. If we kiss, you'll be healed.

20:09.628 --> 20:10.712
Wow.

20:12.631 --> 20:13.965
Ew, guys.

20:14.090 --> 20:16.134
You know we're here, right?

20:16.218 --> 20:17.219
Okay.

20:17.302 --> 20:18.303
"Oh, I love you so much."
All right.

20:18.386 --> 20:19.387
- Ruined it.
- Done.

20:19.471 --> 20:20.639
- You ruined the moment.

20:20.722 --> 20:21.723
Now you're gonna pay.

20:21.806 --> 20:24.017
So cringe.
- No, Dad. Don't do it, don't do it.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.393
- Please, no.
Could you at least wait

20:25.477 --> 20:27.562
- until we're gone?
No.

20:28.688 --> 20:30.273
<i>It's comin' now...</i>

20:30.357 --> 20:31.358
Dad?

20:31.441 --> 20:33.360
- Dad, no! Please, no!

21:10.355 --> 21:11.481
<i>You can't catch us.</i>

21:11.565 --> 21:13.900
<i>You can't catch us! You can't catch us!</i>

21:13.984 --> 21:15.151
<i>Elliot's mine!</i>

21:16.611 --> 21:18.530
Don't let him go.
- Come on! You can't catch us!

21:18.613 --> 21:22.826
<i>Teachers need to implement
backdoor strategies</i>

21:22.909 --> 21:26.246
<i>because students with ADHD
and deeply feeling kids</i>

21:26.329 --> 21:29.499
<i>can be easily overwhelmed
by sensory stimulation,</i>

21:29.583 --> 21:33.211
<i>and they may shut down
when emotionally dysregulated.</i>

21:34.754 --> 21:36.840
<i>Kids who are struggling with anxiety</i>

21:36.923 --> 21:38.842
<i>- and in-class performance...</i>

21:38.925 --> 21:41.177
<i>- ...they're inclined to...</i>

22:03.992 --> 22:05.619
Hey, what's the matter?

22:07.954 --> 22:09.289
Huh?

22:10.040 --> 22:13.001
You don't want to swim? Hmm?

22:16.338 --> 22:17.756
Pussy.

22:57.796 --> 22:59.631
Ray, you scared me.

24:04.946 --> 24:07.073
<i>His 27th home run this season,</i>

24:07.157 --> 24:09.159
<i>and the crowd is fully back in the game.</i>

24:09.242 --> 24:12.871
<i>So many times, we talk about how momentum
can change with one swing of the bat.</i>

24:12.996 --> 24:14.414
<i>One pitch, one play...</i>

24:21.630 --> 24:22.923
You're all wet.

24:24.674 --> 24:26.509
Were you outside a minute ago?

24:27.636 --> 24:28.970
No.

24:29.054 --> 24:31.890
I think I just fell asleep.

24:34.976 --> 24:38.313
I think we should put in a pool cover
just to be safe.

24:39.564 --> 24:41.816
And we need to check out the lights.

24:41.900 --> 24:44.069
Yeah... Yeah, for sure.

24:45.153 --> 24:46.696
Everything okay?

24:47.113 --> 24:49.866
Yeah. Yeah. Go back to sleep.

25:22.649 --> 25:24.025
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

25:24.109 --> 25:25.569
Come look!

25:26.653 --> 25:28.822
He probably fell in and got scared.

25:30.991 --> 25:33.326
Well, he... He'll come back
when he's hungry, huh?

25:34.202 --> 25:35.495
We have to find him.

25:36.037 --> 25:38.248
Yeah, that's... We'll go look for him.

25:38.331 --> 25:39.833
We'll find him.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.668
It's okay, Ellie. He'll come back.

25:41.751 --> 25:43.962
Pshh-pshh-pshh-pshh-pshh-pshh-pshh!

25:44.629 --> 25:46.548
- Cider.
Come here, Cider.

25:46.631 --> 25:47.883
Come on, puss.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.468
Cider, where'd you go?

25:51.094 --> 25:52.220
Cider?

25:52.888 --> 25:55.223
Izzy, did you look down there?

25:55.307 --> 25:57.058
No, I didn't check there.

25:57.183 --> 25:58.184
Here, puss.

25:58.268 --> 25:59.686
Maybe he's up in this tree?

26:01.187 --> 26:02.564
Come here, Cider.

26:02.647 --> 26:03.773
Cider.

26:04.816 --> 26:05.859
Cider!

26:07.527 --> 26:09.321
You guys looked inside the house?

26:10.238 --> 26:11.573
Yeah.
Come here, buddy!

26:11.656 --> 26:13.783
Not upstairs, though.
Did you look upstairs?

26:13.909 --> 26:16.328
Again? I promise you,
I already checked upstairs.

26:19.998 --> 26:21.499
Cider!

26:23.001 --> 26:24.419
Here, Cider.

26:25.670 --> 26:27.297
Come on, Cider.

26:28.590 --> 26:30.383
Cider!

26:34.346 --> 26:35.805
Cider.

26:40.227 --> 26:41.436
Cider.

26:43.438 --> 26:44.481
Want some food?

26:48.401 --> 26:49.736
Come on, Cider.

26:55.951 --> 26:57.535
Come on, put your back into it.

26:57.619 --> 26:59.037
We gotta roll it up, make it tight,

26:59.120 --> 27:01.164
so when we roll it back out,
it's all clean and nice.

27:01.248 --> 27:02.791
Keep cranking. One turn at a time.

27:02.874 --> 27:04.709
I'm trying.
- Come on.

27:04.793 --> 27:06.545
Keep going. You strike out,
you keep going.

27:06.628 --> 27:07.963
Isn't that right? Yeah.

27:08.046 --> 27:09.589
- Don't give up. That's the key.

27:09.673 --> 27:11.925
That's the only thing that matters.
Let's go, come on.

27:12.008 --> 27:13.927
Good job. Little wins.

27:14.010 --> 27:15.303
Here we go. Come on.

27:15.387 --> 27:17.389
Be nice to your brother right now.

27:18.598 --> 27:20.475
None of this has been easy on him.

27:20.600 --> 27:23.728
Keep going, keep going. Good job.

27:24.271 --> 27:25.480
There you go. See?

27:25.605 --> 27:27.607
I know it hasn't been easy on you, either.

27:29.734 --> 27:31.528
Oh, no. Baby, I'm fine.

27:31.611 --> 27:33.238
I don't want you worrying about me.

28:04.394 --> 28:05.729
What is that?

29:07.916 --> 29:10.794
Um, s... What... What is it?

29:15.298 --> 29:18.760
I've never seen
such a dramatic improvement

29:18.843 --> 29:20.720
in such a short time.

29:20.845 --> 29:23.056
We need to do more tests,

29:23.890 --> 29:27.185
but it appears there are no new lesions

29:28.353 --> 29:30.188
and the white tissue
is actually improving.

29:30.730 --> 29:33.567
We started the new diet like you said,

29:33.650 --> 29:35.735
and the water therapy and...

29:35.819 --> 29:37.153
Twice a day.

29:38.780 --> 29:39.864
We have a pool.

29:55.714 --> 29:58.383
Hey, Mom,
I finished all my work in study hall.

29:58.466 --> 29:59.467
Can I go swimming?

29:59.551 --> 30:01.553
Okay, but don't go alone.
Ask your dad.

30:08.351 --> 30:10.687
<i>Here's progress report. I, uh...</i>

30:11.313 --> 30:14.274
<i>You all know I was diagnosed with MS
not too long ago,</i>

30:14.357 --> 30:15.817
<i>a little while back.</i>

30:15.901 --> 30:18.612
- Dad?
<i>- I've been able to work out in rehab</i>

30:18.695 --> 30:21.364
<i>and been getting back at it
for the last little while</i>

30:21.448 --> 30:24.284
<i>and I've made a lot of strides
that I'm proud of.</i>

30:24.367 --> 30:26.244
<i>I think that I can show you,</i>

30:26.328 --> 30:28.830
<i>demonstrate my ability
is still at a level that</i>

30:28.914 --> 30:31.708
<i>I'd be able to make an impact
on a team rather quickly.</i>

30:31.791 --> 30:32.918
Hey, pal.

30:35.045 --> 30:36.463
Can you help me out with something?

30:37.631 --> 30:38.632
Yeah.

30:39.174 --> 30:40.675
Can you throw on a 25?

30:50.435 --> 30:52.187
What are you doing with the camera?

30:52.270 --> 30:54.522
Helps me with my training.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.873
Can you dive for coins with me?

31:11.957 --> 31:13.583
Mom says I can't swim alone.

31:18.547 --> 31:19.756
Yeah, um...

31:21.424 --> 31:22.759
Uh...

31:24.302 --> 31:26.513
Yeah. Hey, hand me one of those coins.

31:30.600 --> 31:31.643
Here.

31:34.396 --> 31:36.064
You gotta promise me

31:36.147 --> 31:37.983
you're gonna stay
in the shallow end. Okay?

31:38.066 --> 31:39.192
Okay.

31:39.317 --> 31:40.652
Throw this one in the pool for me.

31:42.404 --> 31:44.698
And I'll come find it. Okay?

31:45.365 --> 31:46.449
All right.

32:30.785 --> 32:32.037
Hey, Dad.

33:30.136 --> 33:31.221
Hello?

33:41.439 --> 33:42.857
I got 'em all in one breath.

33:52.742 --> 33:55.579
Izzy? It's not funny.

33:59.583 --> 34:00.584
Izzy?

34:03.837 --> 34:05.171
I know that's you.

34:09.259 --> 34:10.468
I'm keeping the money.

34:15.265 --> 34:17.475
Okay, I'm going under.

35:05.941 --> 35:07.234
Hello?

35:12.572 --> 35:13.907
Can you hear me?

35:18.286 --> 35:19.704
I need help.

35:24.709 --> 35:26.503
I'm looking for my mom.

35:28.463 --> 35:29.881
Who are you?

35:30.840 --> 35:33.051
My name is Rebecca Summers.

35:36.888 --> 35:38.723
I found your  toy.

36:06.835 --> 36:08.753
Let go of me!

36:14.217 --> 36:15.552
Help!

36:24.060 --> 36:25.103
Mom.

36:27.522 --> 36:28.940
Is someone out here?

36:35.238 --> 36:36.615
Ellie, are you sure?

36:36.698 --> 36:37.991
Her name is Rebecca.

36:38.950 --> 36:41.036
She said she was looking for her mom.

37:06.478 --> 37:10.232
It was probably just a kid
who snuck over the gate. That's all.

37:10.690 --> 37:12.525
Anyway, we have a lock on it now, so...

37:12.609 --> 37:14.444
I didn't see anyone out there.

37:15.528 --> 37:17.239
Maybe he's pretending.

37:18.073 --> 37:19.950
'Cause he doesn't have
any real friends yet.

37:20.033 --> 37:22.994
Remember he talked to that pet gecko
or lizard, or whatever?

37:23.078 --> 37:24.079
He was five.

37:24.162 --> 37:26.248
Yeah, but he talked to him
for months after he died.

37:26.331 --> 37:28.458
He's gonna make friends. He just...

37:28.541 --> 37:30.293
It just takes him time.

37:30.794 --> 37:34.256
Yeah. I'm going to
his practice later today.

37:35.257 --> 37:38.176
So, maybe that'll help, like,
break the ice with the kids.

37:38.718 --> 37:39.803
Yeah.

37:40.428 --> 37:42.681
You should come,
'cause he always plays better

37:42.764 --> 37:44.266
when you're there. He's more himself.

37:46.351 --> 37:47.519
Hmm.

37:48.937 --> 37:51.064
Maybe we should have the team over.

37:51.147 --> 37:53.608
- You know, for a cookout or something?
- Yes.

37:53.692 --> 37:54.776
That's a great idea.

37:54.859 --> 37:56.361
- Yeah?
- Yeah, like a pool party.

37:56.444 --> 37:58.863
That's why I married you,
because you're a genius.

37:58.947 --> 38:00.532
Invite your coworkers, friends, whoever.

38:00.657 --> 38:02.409
- Just "Meet the Wallers," right?
- Mm-hmm.

38:02.492 --> 38:03.743
Sounds great.
Can I invite some friends?

38:03.827 --> 38:05.996
Yes, invite whoever you want.
It's a great idea.

38:06.079 --> 38:07.289
We should invite everybody you know.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.498
- We're a welcoming family.
Stop.

38:08.582 --> 38:10.208
How many people you think
we can fit in the pool?

38:10.292 --> 38:11.459
We're the pool family now.

38:13.169 --> 38:14.379
All right. Get in front of it.

38:15.088 --> 38:16.631
Good. Move it around.

38:16.715 --> 38:18.216
There you go, in front of it,
in front of it.

38:19.092 --> 38:20.677
It's all right. It's all right.

38:20.760 --> 38:22.095
Get in front of it. In front of it.

38:23.638 --> 38:25.515
Come on, wake up, man.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.309
Let's hustle. Let's hustle, boys.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.352
You know what baseball is, right?

38:30.604 --> 38:33.106
It's a stick and a ball

38:33.189 --> 38:35.609
and a bunch of guys wearing long socks.

38:38.111 --> 38:39.321
It's play.

38:40.363 --> 38:42.782
How come it's so easy for Dad and Izzy?

38:42.866 --> 38:44.200
It's not.

38:45.577 --> 38:47.579
Everyone's scared of something.

38:48.121 --> 38:50.749
Izzy used to hate drop-off
in kindergarten.

38:51.541 --> 38:53.877
Every day, I'd wait outside
until I saw her

38:54.002 --> 38:56.338
in the classroom window,
and she'd give me the signal.

38:57.047 --> 38:58.465
- Show him, Iz.
There we go!

38:58.632 --> 39:00.217
Good job, good job.

39:01.760 --> 39:03.136
Green light to swing.

39:03.220 --> 39:04.346
Wait for the ball, boys!

39:04.429 --> 39:05.722
Come on, come on!

39:05.805 --> 39:07.807
- Hey, there he is.
Hey, Coach. Sorry I'm late.

39:08.391 --> 39:10.143
- Hey, guys.
Hey.

39:10.227 --> 39:11.228
All right.

39:11.895 --> 39:13.355
You got this.

39:14.105 --> 39:16.191
Hey, boys, this is Elliot's dad.

39:16.274 --> 39:18.318
He's a former Brewers third baseman,

39:18.401 --> 39:20.320
and he's here to turn you
into all-star hitters.

39:21.321 --> 39:23.490
You got this. You got this. Nice and easy.

39:26.034 --> 39:28.328
You gotta follow through the ball.
Don't just, like, check swing.

39:29.204 --> 39:30.914
- There you go.
- Yes! Nice!

39:30.997 --> 39:32.707
All right. Line drive up the middle.
There you go.

39:32.791 --> 39:34.084
All right, move it around, move it around.

39:34.167 --> 39:36.044
You're bent way over
at the waist, right?

39:36.169 --> 39:37.420
And you turn out with your body.

39:37.504 --> 39:39.464
Don't hit it with your hands.
You turn out with your body.

39:39.548 --> 39:40.840
- All right. Good job.
There you go!

39:40.924 --> 39:42.259
Way to get on top of it. Good job.

39:42.342 --> 39:44.386
Oh, hey, Ray, that's my son, Ty.

39:44.511 --> 39:46.263
Yeah, keep an eye.
He's got good mechanics.

39:46.346 --> 39:47.931
All right, Ty.
Let's see what you got.

39:49.558 --> 39:50.850
- There you go.

39:50.934 --> 39:52.435
Yes, Ty! Yes!

39:52.769 --> 39:54.604
- Good swing. Good hit.
Yeah, I got you, Dad.

39:54.729 --> 39:56.231
- Good job.
Thanks, Mr. Waller.

39:56.314 --> 39:57.482
All right, El, you ready?

39:58.441 --> 39:59.526
Go, Ellie!

39:59.609 --> 40:01.194
All right, let's go.
Hey. Good luck out there, man.

40:01.278 --> 40:02.404
You got this.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.781
Way to go. Good job, Ty.

40:04.864 --> 40:06.283
Hey, Ellie.

40:12.122 --> 40:13.707
All right, Elliot.

40:14.332 --> 40:15.750
All right, come on. You got this.

40:16.585 --> 40:17.836
You got it, Elliot.

40:18.670 --> 40:20.130
- There you go. Nice!
Nice going.

40:20.213 --> 40:22.507
- There you go. All right. Good job.

40:22.591 --> 40:24.175
- Yes, Elliot.
All right.

40:24.301 --> 40:25.552
That's what stepping into the ball does.

40:25.677 --> 40:26.720
You go after it and you get it.

40:26.803 --> 40:27.971
Good job. Way to go.

40:28.054 --> 40:29.639
Try for the other side of the field.
Way to go.

40:29.723 --> 40:30.807
We'll work on it. Don't worry about it.

40:30.891 --> 40:32.392
Hey, Ray, you want to take some?

40:32.517 --> 40:33.518
Um...

40:33.602 --> 40:35.020
I mean, if you're up for it.

40:35.937 --> 40:37.480
Um...

40:37.564 --> 40:39.316
Yeah?
Sure, right?

40:39.399 --> 40:41.109
Take a couple. I'll be fine.

40:41.192 --> 40:43.778
All right. All right,
get ready, boys! Get ready!

40:43.862 --> 40:45.071
All right.

40:45.196 --> 40:46.448
Okay, you ready?

40:46.573 --> 40:47.949
You guys ready out there?

40:48.074 --> 40:49.200
Bend your knees. Bend your knees.

40:49.492 --> 40:50.785
Take it easy on me.

40:51.286 --> 40:53.163
I haven't swung in a while.

40:58.376 --> 41:00.420
All right, hold on.
Let me loosen up real quick.

41:00.503 --> 41:03.006
- Okay, okay. Next one.
Just let me... Yeah.

41:11.723 --> 41:13.183
Dad?

41:14.226 --> 41:15.268
You okay, boss?

41:15.936 --> 41:16.937
Ooh.

41:17.020 --> 41:19.481
Ray? You okay?

41:19.564 --> 41:22.150
I'm okay.

41:24.236 --> 41:25.654
I'm good. Let's keep going.

41:25.779 --> 41:27.239
- Okay.
I'm good. I'm good.

41:27.322 --> 41:28.740
Shit.

41:28.823 --> 41:30.283
Why don't you throw that again?

41:30.367 --> 41:31.409
All right.

42:13.785 --> 42:15.495
Oh, my God!

42:16.454 --> 42:17.831
Oh, my God!

42:30.051 --> 42:31.928
See, boys, that's how you hit a ball.

42:32.012 --> 42:33.638
That's how you hit it, man.

42:48.945 --> 42:51.615
You know the deal.
Stay in the house, bed by 10:00.

42:51.698 --> 42:53.158
- We'll be back after dinner.
- Mm-hmm.

42:53.241 --> 42:55.035
Don't make me regret not getting a sitter.

42:55.118 --> 42:56.745
Yeah, okay, I know.
- Yeah?

42:57.913 --> 42:59.289
Ray, you ready?

42:59.372 --> 43:00.457
We gotta go.

43:10.050 --> 43:12.802
Hey, someone's coming over in a minute.
It's not a big deal.

43:13.428 --> 43:14.512
Okay.

43:16.973 --> 43:18.391
It's for the swim team.

43:19.935 --> 43:21.019
Okay.

43:32.072 --> 43:33.448
If you tell Mom,

43:33.573 --> 43:36.034
I'm gonna put a Tide POD
in your fish tank.

43:37.661 --> 43:38.870
Okay.

43:40.914 --> 43:41.998
Marco.

43:42.958 --> 43:44.084
Polo.

43:44.167 --> 43:45.502
Marco.

43:45.585 --> 43:47.128
Polo.

43:51.299 --> 43:53.385
Marco. Marco.

43:53.510 --> 43:54.761
Polo.

43:58.014 --> 43:59.766
You're cheating. You opened your eyes.

43:59.891 --> 44:00.892
- Uh-uh.
- Uh-huh.

44:00.976 --> 44:02.310
I mean, you look great with your hair wet.

44:03.853 --> 44:05.355
You're supposed to say "Polo."

44:05.438 --> 44:07.148
-  Polo.
-  Stop.

44:08.942 --> 44:11.027
Okay. Marco.

44:11.695 --> 44:13.071
Polo.

44:15.115 --> 44:16.116
Fish out of water.

44:16.199 --> 44:17.993
Nope.

44:18.952 --> 44:21.037
<i>They want to see you break...</i>

44:21.162 --> 44:22.831
Marco.

44:24.207 --> 44:26.793
Come on. You have to say something back.

44:27.294 --> 44:28.503
Polo.

44:31.298 --> 44:32.966
Marco.

44:33.091 --> 44:36.219
<i>They want to see you break...</i>

44:44.394 --> 44:45.770
Polo.

44:46.479 --> 44:47.772
Marco?

44:54.529 --> 44:57.365
Ronin, stop, please. Marco.

45:02.287 --> 45:03.496
Polo.

45:04.831 --> 45:06.249
I hear you.

45:14.841 --> 45:16.468
You're right there.

45:20.055 --> 45:21.306
Marco. Come on.

45:24.893 --> 45:26.102
Come on.

45:28.688 --> 45:30.232
Got you. No!

45:53.088 --> 45:54.214
Polo.

45:58.134 --> 45:59.678
Ronin, you're dead.

46:58.361 --> 47:00.238
I got you.

47:00.322 --> 47:02.574
Wait, why didn't you call
"fish out of water"?

47:02.657 --> 47:04.117
- Izzy?
- Oh, my God.

47:05.327 --> 47:06.828
- Hey.

47:06.912 --> 47:07.996
Izzy?

47:08.914 --> 47:09.915
Izzy, you okay?

47:10.665 --> 47:12.834
Hey, hey, hey. Talk to me.

47:12.918 --> 47:14.669
Something was down there.
Something grabbed me.

47:14.794 --> 47:16.463
- Something grabbed you?
- Were you not down there?

47:16.880 --> 47:19.257
No. Look, look, it's okay.
Look, I'm right here.

47:19.633 --> 47:20.842
I didn't see anything.

47:20.926 --> 47:22.344
You were only down there
for a couple seconds.

47:22.427 --> 47:24.304
Maybe your foot got stuck
in the pool cleaner.

47:28.183 --> 47:31.019
- Did it?
- I... I don't know. Maybe.

47:32.646 --> 47:34.231
It's okay, all right? It's okay.

47:34.898 --> 47:36.066
There's nothing there.

47:36.149 --> 47:37.150
Izzy!

47:37.234 --> 47:38.735
- Mom and Dad are home!
Shit. Oh, shit.

47:38.818 --> 47:40.195
I didn't tell my parents
you were coming over.

47:40.278 --> 47:41.821
- Oh, wow.
- I'm sorry. You gotta grab your stuff

47:41.905 --> 47:43.448
- and get out the back gate.
- All right.

47:43.531 --> 47:45.158
Well, thanks for inviting me over.

47:47.369 --> 47:49.204
All right, great.
I'll catch you on Saturday?

47:49.287 --> 47:51.331
Uh, Saturday?

47:51.915 --> 47:52.958
The pool party.

47:53.041 --> 47:55.210
- Oh. Yeah.
- All right.

47:59.297 --> 48:02.342
<i>They want to see you break...</i>

48:07.389 --> 48:09.057
The gate won't open.

48:16.022 --> 48:17.190
Izzy.

48:17.983 --> 48:19.943
I know something scared you last night.

48:20.777 --> 48:22.988
I saw the way you got out of the water.

48:23.071 --> 48:24.364
Go away.

48:27.367 --> 48:28.618
Tell me.

48:30.203 --> 48:32.289
Or I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad
your boyfriend was here.

48:39.045 --> 48:40.630
You saw something, didn't you?

48:43.633 --> 48:44.759
No.

48:44.843 --> 48:46.636
My leg just got caught
in the pool cleaner.

48:46.720 --> 48:49.055
- You're lying. I can tell.

48:49.139 --> 48:50.307
Stop.

48:54.895 --> 48:57.230
Things have been better
since we moved here.

48:58.690 --> 49:01.610
I mean, Dad's healthier.

49:01.735 --> 49:02.861
Mom's happy.

49:03.445 --> 49:06.531
Do you want to freak them out
just so we have to move again?

49:06.656 --> 49:08.033
What makes more sense,

49:08.116 --> 49:10.785
that the pool's helping us
or that it's haunted?

49:11.953 --> 49:13.622
What if it's both?

49:14.956 --> 49:15.957
Hey, I'm back!

49:19.294 --> 49:21.296
Keep your mouth shut.

49:21.379 --> 49:23.089
Hey. Where are you two?

49:23.215 --> 49:24.841
No one's gonna believe us anyway.

49:25.800 --> 49:27.719
Coming, Mom. I can help.

49:29.512 --> 49:31.097
Everything okay?

49:32.933 --> 49:34.893
Yeah, Mom. Everything's fine.

49:38.104 --> 49:39.356
Oh, shit.

49:39.439 --> 49:41.399
<i>Are you ready now</i>

49:41.483 --> 49:42.943
<i>To get on down?</i>

49:46.071 --> 49:48.198
<i>Get on down, baby</i>

49:49.950 --> 49:51.785
<i>Get on down...</i>

49:55.413 --> 49:57.207
It's so nice to meet you guys.

49:57.791 --> 49:59.417
I mean, you really didn't
have to bring that.

49:59.501 --> 50:02.212
Are you kidding?
You're hosting the entire neighborhood.

50:02.337 --> 50:03.672
- Thank you.
- Of course.

50:03.797 --> 50:05.674
Uh, is Mr. Waller here?

50:05.757 --> 50:07.217
Oh, yeah. He's out back.

50:07.300 --> 50:08.885
You-you guys can go say hi.

50:09.636 --> 50:12.681
Hey. Oh, my God, the house looks great.

50:12.806 --> 50:13.807
Oh, wow.

50:13.932 --> 50:15.934
I made my jiggly rum cake.

50:16.351 --> 50:17.352
Wow.

50:17.435 --> 50:19.271
But this is not for the kids. Okay?

50:19.396 --> 50:20.772
There's enough Captain Morgan in here

50:20.897 --> 50:23.400
to get Phil
into his famous Bermuda G-string.

50:23.483 --> 50:24.818
Grrr.

50:33.076 --> 50:34.786
You seem to be
doing a lot better, man.

50:34.869 --> 50:36.079
Thank you.
- I don't think I've ever seen

50:36.162 --> 50:37.247
anybody hit a ball that hard.

50:37.330 --> 50:39.624
Tell my agent that when you see him.

50:39.708 --> 50:42.335
Yeah, he used to rep
Evan Longoria, Mark Teixeira.

50:42.419 --> 50:44.087
- He repped a lot of good people.
- No shit.

50:44.170 --> 50:46.214
- Yeah.
- You know, I'd love for Ty to meet him.

50:46.298 --> 50:47.507
Yeah, sure. Maybe I can get him

50:47.591 --> 50:48.758
- to come to practice.
Sun's out, guns out.

50:48.842 --> 50:51.344
You ready? Let's go. Coming in.

51:00.770 --> 51:03.148
Yeah, so he...
He came over for a swim last night.

51:03.231 --> 51:05.317
Um, it was cool.

51:06.902 --> 51:09.863
But, uh, he... He kissed me.

51:10.739 --> 51:12.490
Shut up. No, he didn't.

51:12.574 --> 51:15.160
But I... I actually think
it's hotter that he's Christian.

51:15.702 --> 51:16.703
- Really?
- Really?

51:16.786 --> 51:17.829
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's, like, forbidden.

51:17.913 --> 51:19.915
Hey, Izzy, I got this for you.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.458
- You all right?
Yeah.

51:22.125 --> 51:23.835
- What?

51:24.753 --> 51:25.754
Nothing. We were just...

51:25.837 --> 51:27.255
- We were saying we should go for a swim.
- We're gonna go for a swim.

51:27.339 --> 51:28.840
- Yeah.
- We're gonna head out to the water.

51:28.965 --> 51:30.508
Come on. Come on.

51:30.592 --> 51:31.801
I'm good, thanks.

51:31.885 --> 51:33.511
You sure? All right.
- Yeah.

51:35.055 --> 51:38.058
<i>In this land of mirrors and weed</i>

51:38.183 --> 51:39.351
<i>Walk the line...</i>

51:48.193 --> 51:50.153
The kids must love the pool.

51:50.237 --> 51:51.655
Do you swim?

51:51.738 --> 51:53.531
Oh, my dad was Navy.

51:53.615 --> 51:55.742
I was doing dive drills
before I could walk.

51:55.825 --> 51:57.953
Oh. Well, you should have
seen her eyes light up

51:58.036 --> 51:59.537
when she saw this place.

52:01.039 --> 52:03.208
I can tell that you're used to hosting.

52:03.333 --> 52:04.459
Mm-hmm.

52:04.543 --> 52:06.836
Well, we moved so much
when Ray was playing.

52:06.920 --> 52:10.632
It's just nice to meet people
you might actually know next year.

52:10.715 --> 52:12.300
You're gonna know us.

52:12.384 --> 52:14.594
This is an annual event, like it or not.

52:22.519 --> 52:24.145
And did you bring your suit today?

52:24.229 --> 52:26.189
I did. I'm wearing it already.
- Okay, good.

52:26.273 --> 52:28.275
I haven't had a suit in 25 years.

52:32.529 --> 52:34.281
<i>Throw a little color on it...</i>

52:37.033 --> 52:40.412
<i>- On the canvas, bottoms up
- Bottoms up...</i>

52:43.290 --> 52:44.457
Hey, El!

52:45.166 --> 52:46.251
El!

52:46.793 --> 52:48.503
Where are you? Let's get in the pool.

52:48.587 --> 52:50.380
Mr. Waller?
- Hey.

52:50.505 --> 52:51.756
Hey, El!

52:51.840 --> 52:53.091
Will you sign this for me?

52:54.342 --> 52:56.553
It took me like an hour
to find it last night.

53:06.813 --> 53:07.939
Yeah, of course.

53:10.191 --> 53:12.193
Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

53:14.613 --> 53:15.614
There you go.

53:15.697 --> 53:17.657
- Now hold on to that.
- I will.

53:17.741 --> 53:19.075
It's gonna be worth something someday.

53:19.159 --> 53:20.619
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:21.286 --> 53:23.413
- Hey.
- Yeah?

53:24.539 --> 53:27.792
Steroid Shrek over here
thinks he owns the damn pool.

53:28.293 --> 53:29.544
Think we can take him?

53:33.465 --> 53:35.133
Yeah, I got you, man!

53:37.427 --> 53:39.012
- All right, we got this, okay?
- Yeah. All right.

53:39.095 --> 53:40.430
- Let's go. Come on.
- Okay.

53:48.104 --> 53:49.606
You ready, Big League?

53:54.402 --> 53:55.695
Nice, buddy.

53:56.363 --> 53:57.572
Get 'em, Mikey!

53:57.656 --> 53:59.282
You know, when we were fixing up the pool,

53:59.366 --> 54:02.702
they said it hadn't been used
in probably 15 years.

54:02.786 --> 54:03.787
Maybe longer.

54:04.246 --> 54:05.664
It's weird, right?

54:07.165 --> 54:08.250
No. No, I don't know.

54:08.333 --> 54:10.085
Maybe they weren't pool people.

54:13.838 --> 54:15.465
- Kay?
- Hmm?

54:18.260 --> 54:19.469
Okay, you know what?

54:22.931 --> 54:24.516
You know, this is your new home,

54:24.599 --> 54:27.561
and I-I didn't want to say anything
that would taint your...

54:27.644 --> 54:28.979
Your feelings about this house.

54:29.062 --> 54:31.231
Come on, we closed months ago. What is it?

54:31.731 --> 54:33.400
Get it, buddy. Yeah.
Ty, use your core.

54:33.483 --> 54:34.818
Let's go!
Use your core, Ty.

54:34.901 --> 54:36.111
There you go. Lean forward a little bit.

54:36.194 --> 54:37.445
- Yeah. That's it.
- Lean forward.

54:37.529 --> 54:39.573
Use your arms. Your arms.
Going down, Mikey.

54:39.656 --> 54:43.785
I swear, I had no idea
that this was the same house

54:43.910 --> 54:45.996
until my friend told me
after you'd already moved in.

54:46.079 --> 54:50.333
And I was gonna tell you,
but you seemed so happy here. And I...

54:50.417 --> 54:53.712
I didn't want to put any poo
in the pudding.

54:55.797 --> 54:56.798
Um...

54:57.674 --> 54:59.301
It... It's very possible

54:59.384 --> 55:01.678
that the people that lived here
before, that they...

55:02.596 --> 55:05.348
You know, they liked the neighborhood,
and they wanted the good school district,

55:05.432 --> 55:08.184
but they didn't feel comfortable
using the pool

55:08.268 --> 55:10.770
because of certain alleged events.

55:11.271 --> 55:12.606
Alleged events?

55:13.273 --> 55:15.442
Yeah, I...

55:16.151 --> 55:17.569
You know, I don't remember much about it.

55:17.652 --> 55:20.363
Just there were these stories
about this little girl who...

55:20.447 --> 55:22.073
Uh, from Harold Holt...

55:23.033 --> 55:25.368
and she drowned here.

55:26.995 --> 55:29.831
I know, it's just... Oh, it is a tragedy.

55:31.041 --> 55:32.751
You know, I mean,
I don't know why that would make

55:32.834 --> 55:34.753
someone not want to use
a perfectly good swimming pool,

55:34.836 --> 55:35.837
but you know what?

55:35.921 --> 55:38.048
People are... They're superstitious.

55:38.131 --> 55:39.174
Aren't they, really?

55:41.009 --> 55:42.844
Was the little girl's name Rebecca?

55:44.804 --> 55:46.514
Wait. How did you know that?

55:46.598 --> 55:48.558
Okay, keep pushing.

55:48.642 --> 55:50.393
Let's go. Let's take 'em down.

55:50.477 --> 55:51.603
Come on, Ty.

55:51.686 --> 55:54.022
-  Don't give up. Use your legs.
Let's go.

55:54.105 --> 55:55.273
Come on, Ty.
Keep going.

55:55.357 --> 55:56.691
Use your legs, Ty.
You got him. Keep pushing.

55:56.775 --> 55:57.776
Let's go now.

55:57.859 --> 55:59.986
Don't give up.
Get him, Mikey.

56:00.070 --> 56:02.239
-  That's it, buddy.
You're going down!

56:09.329 --> 56:10.580
Let's go! We won!

56:12.123 --> 56:13.458
Let's go!

56:13.541 --> 56:15.835
We did it, Mr. Waller!

56:16.711 --> 56:18.213
All right, you can let go now.

56:18.922 --> 56:20.840
Mr. Waller. Mr. Waller.

56:21.633 --> 56:23.426
Hey, let go. Hey!

56:24.094 --> 56:26.054
Mr. Waller, please let go.

56:26.721 --> 56:28.807
You've got my legs, Mr. Waller.

56:28.890 --> 56:31.977
Let go! Let go!

56:40.110 --> 56:41.403
Mr. Waller.

56:41.528 --> 56:43.405
You're grabbing on my legs. Stop.

56:43.488 --> 56:45.365
Let go! Mr. Waller!

56:51.621 --> 56:52.747
Mr. Waller...

56:55.542 --> 56:56.668
Let go!

57:11.808 --> 57:12.809
Mom!

57:13.810 --> 57:15.020
Hey, Ty.

57:16.730 --> 57:17.731
Ty.

57:19.274 --> 57:22.027
- Baby, you seen Ty?
Mom! Mom!

57:23.028 --> 57:24.988
Mom. Outside in the pool.

57:28.325 --> 57:29.618
Oh, my God. Ty!

57:30.160 --> 57:31.202
Oh, my...

57:31.286 --> 57:32.913
- Ty?
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

57:37.167 --> 57:39.252
Ty! What happened?

57:39.336 --> 57:40.545
Help me! Someone help!

57:40.629 --> 57:41.630
Give him to me.
Get him out.

57:41.713 --> 57:43.381
Pull him over the edge.

57:43.465 --> 57:44.633
Someone call for help!

57:44.716 --> 57:46.092
Mom, look! It's Dad!
Move!

57:46.176 --> 57:47.219
- Ty, breathe. Breathe.
It's okay. It's okay.

57:47.302 --> 57:49.387
- I got him.
- Come on, breathe, breathe. What happened?

57:49.471 --> 57:51.056
What happened?

57:51.890 --> 57:53.099
What the hell happened?

57:53.183 --> 57:54.726
Someone call for help.

57:54.809 --> 57:55.977
Call 911!

57:56.061 --> 57:57.938
- Someone call for help.
Ray. Ray.

57:58.063 --> 57:59.773
What happened, Ty?

58:08.448 --> 58:11.117
Dad? Dad?

58:11.660 --> 58:12.953
- You're okay.
Okay.

58:13.036 --> 58:15.538
- Yeah, just hold on to my arm.
- It's okay. It's okay.

58:15.622 --> 58:16.623
- Okay.
Let's get him inside.

58:16.706 --> 58:18.959
Okay, one, two...
- It's okay. You're okay.

58:29.594 --> 58:31.096
Ty said he wouldn't let go.

58:31.179 --> 58:33.807
No, Coach, you know the disease
attacks his nervous system.

58:33.890 --> 58:36.059
I mean... No. He nearly drowned, too.

58:36.768 --> 58:38.436
We're not gonna press charges, Officer.

58:38.520 --> 58:39.771
We're fine.

58:40.438 --> 58:41.690
Hey, Eve, I just...

58:41.773 --> 58:44.609
I don't think
Ray should come to practice anymore.

58:47.487 --> 58:48.697
Look, I'm so sorry.

58:48.780 --> 58:50.490
Do you hear what he's saying?

58:51.157 --> 58:53.368
Don't come near our family again.

59:12.846 --> 59:14.347
<i>Come on, let's go. Let's go.</i>
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

59:14.431 --> 59:15.932
- Stop, stop. Stop.
- Here, just put the...

59:16.016 --> 59:17.183
- Stop! God, wait.
- Get in the car.

59:17.267 --> 59:18.810
Wait. Where are we going?

59:18.894 --> 59:20.896
I don't know. Just not here.

59:22.063 --> 59:23.648
There's something wrong with that pool.

59:23.732 --> 59:25.525
Eve, there's nothing wrong with the pool.

59:25.609 --> 59:27.193
The pool's fine.

59:27.819 --> 59:30.405
The pool's the greatest thing
to ever happen to me.

59:30.488 --> 59:33.241
Look... Listen. I mean, honey,
it would be different this time.

59:33.325 --> 59:34.951
It would be so different.
We wouldn't have to make the same sacri...

59:35.035 --> 59:36.703
What are you talking about?

59:37.412 --> 59:39.581
You almost drowned today.

59:42.334 --> 59:44.294
That little boy almost drowned.

59:53.720 --> 59:54.804
All right.

01:00:01.102 --> 01:00:02.312
- Dad?

01:00:02.812 --> 01:00:04.606
- Dad, stop.
Mom, what's going on?

01:00:04.689 --> 01:00:06.233
- Stop the car.

01:00:07.234 --> 01:00:09.319
- Mom, do something.
- I don't know what to do.

01:00:09.402 --> 01:00:11.154
Is he breathing?

01:00:11.238 --> 01:00:13.990
- What is happening?
Please! He can't breathe!

01:00:15.242 --> 01:00:16.910
Cough it out.
- Oh, my God.

01:00:17.452 --> 01:00:19.037
Dad.
Get him out of the car!

01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:21.915
No, no, no, he's stable now, but I...

01:00:21.998 --> 01:00:24.084
I've never seen him like this before.

01:00:25.669 --> 01:00:28.797
It was like something
was attacking him from the inside.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.132
<i>Look,
I know these episodes are frightening.</i>

01:00:31.216 --> 01:00:33.260
<i>I can have him come in on Tuesday</i>

01:00:33.343 --> 01:00:35.971
<i>for another round of tests,
but in the meantime,</i>

01:00:36.596 --> 01:00:39.015
<i>- just let him rest and recover.</i>

01:00:43.603 --> 01:00:44.604
Eve.

01:00:44.688 --> 01:00:46.398
I'm sorry. I don't know what's happening.

01:00:46.523 --> 01:00:48.441
- It's okay.
- I didn't mean to hurt that boy.

01:00:48.525 --> 01:00:49.734
You don't have to talk.

01:00:54.489 --> 01:00:56.116
We'll just get you stable and just...

01:00:56.241 --> 01:00:57.867
We'll figure out what to do.

01:01:01.079 --> 01:01:03.123
It's just one more time.
It's just one more.

01:01:03.248 --> 01:01:04.833
I just need one more time.

01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:07.544
You can carry me into the pool.
I just need to get in one more time.

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.765
It's so cool in the deep water.

01:01:24.185 --> 01:01:26.605
It's so cool in the deep.

01:01:59.930 --> 01:02:02.015
I told him he could sleep here tonight.

01:02:19.866 --> 01:02:22.494
You know your dad talks about being at bat

01:02:23.745 --> 01:02:27.165
and feeling this rush of strength
when you were born?

01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:34.756
I was 22 in a hospital
surrounded by strangers, and...

01:02:36.258 --> 01:02:39.052
And I felt totally alone.

01:02:42.013 --> 01:02:43.306
And I didn't...

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:45.058
And I didn't think I could keep pushing.

01:02:45.183 --> 01:02:47.727
I didn't think I would... I didn't...

01:02:48.603 --> 01:02:50.814
I didn't think I would be a good mom.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.276
And I just wanted to give up.

01:02:57.195 --> 01:03:00.865
And you must have felt how scared I was.

01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:06.746
Because suddenly, there you were.

01:03:08.623 --> 01:03:10.625
And I wasn't alone anymore.

01:03:19.384 --> 01:03:22.053
We're never alone if we have each other.

01:03:24.431 --> 01:03:27.267
I'm not gonna let anything
bad happen to us, okay?

01:03:28.643 --> 01:03:29.728
Okay.

01:03:37.235 --> 01:03:38.904
<i>Hi, Eve.
I'm sorry your party ended</i>

01:03:38.987 --> 01:03:42.324
<i>on a sour note, but you give people time
and they're gonna forget all about it.</i>

01:03:42.407 --> 01:03:44.409
<i>Kay, it's not that. It's...</i>

01:03:45.201 --> 01:03:47.621
<i>Would you consider yourself
an open-minded person?</i>

01:03:47.704 --> 01:03:49.748
<i>Yeah, I like to think so.</i>

01:03:49.831 --> 01:03:51.082
<i>Why are you asking?</i>

01:03:51.166 --> 01:03:52.667
It wasn't just Rebecca.

01:03:52.751 --> 01:03:54.502
If you go back, there's more people

01:03:54.586 --> 01:03:56.546
<i>who lived at the house
who just went missing.</i>

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:58.298
<i>I need to know what's going on.</i>

01:03:58.381 --> 01:04:01.426
<i>Eve, I swear I told you
everything I knew at the house.</i>

01:04:01.509 --> 01:04:03.637
<i>I don't know anything about this.</i>

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.598
<i>- Just tell me what I can do to help.
- Does the Summers family live nearby?</i>

01:04:52.143 --> 01:04:53.186
Hi.

01:04:54.271 --> 01:04:56.106
My name is Eve Waller.

01:04:57.232 --> 01:04:59.067
I tried to call you yesterday.

01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:01.861
I think my family lives in your old house.

01:05:01.945 --> 01:05:03.530
With the pool?

01:05:04.406 --> 01:05:06.825
Oh. Yes.

01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:08.451
Come in.

01:05:09.869 --> 01:05:11.079
That's Thomas.

01:05:12.163 --> 01:05:14.916
USAID ambassador in Washington.

01:05:15.709 --> 01:05:20.881
His work in Sudan saved thousands
during the refugee crisis.

01:05:21.631 --> 01:05:22.632
Your son?

01:05:22.757 --> 01:05:25.302
Yeah. My pride and joy.

01:05:26.761 --> 01:05:29.848
He's responsible for this beautiful home.

01:05:29.931 --> 01:05:32.100
Though he doesn't visit
as much as I'd like.

01:05:32.934 --> 01:05:36.771
This is about as far
as I can make it, if you don't mind.

01:05:36.855 --> 01:05:37.856
Please.

01:05:42.235 --> 01:05:45.655
I know this is strange,
but I wanted to ask you about

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.324
when you lived at the house.

01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:51.077
Oh.  What a special place.

01:05:52.746 --> 01:05:54.581
Tommy loved that pool.

01:05:54.664 --> 01:05:56.875
I could hardly get him out of the water.

01:05:59.044 --> 01:06:01.296
Did you have a daughter, too?

01:06:04.716 --> 01:06:07.385
No, it's... It's just Thomas and I.

01:06:08.386 --> 01:06:11.223
Oh, he writes the most wonderful letters.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.433
He's in Washington,

01:06:13.516 --> 01:06:15.227
doing so much good.

01:06:19.356 --> 01:06:21.441
Mrs. Summers, I'm not here to upset you.

01:06:22.776 --> 01:06:24.945
But I don't know who else to talk to.

01:06:26.947 --> 01:06:28.573
My husband was sick,

01:06:29.908 --> 01:06:33.078
and we moved into the house,

01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:34.788
and he started getting better.

01:06:36.748 --> 01:06:38.166
And I think

01:06:39.626 --> 01:06:41.545
the pool made him better.

01:06:44.172 --> 01:06:47.384
But my kids have seen things.

01:06:50.011 --> 01:06:51.429
And so have I.

01:06:55.225 --> 01:06:58.770
There's something bad
in the water, isn't there?

01:07:09.406 --> 01:07:11.241
What happened to your daughter?

01:07:12.784 --> 01:07:13.785
To Rebecca?

01:07:18.039 --> 01:07:21.418
Please. I'm worried that the same thing
is going to happen to my husband.

01:07:43.189 --> 01:07:46.526
Did you ever use
a wishing well as a child?

01:07:48.486 --> 01:07:50.572
Throw a coin in the water

01:07:52.157 --> 01:07:54.326
and pray with all your heart.

01:07:57.746 --> 01:08:00.498
Some water is magic.

01:08:11.509 --> 01:08:14.179
Before there was a house

01:08:15.347 --> 01:08:16.765
or a pool,

01:08:18.225 --> 01:08:20.435
<i>there was a spring in the ground.</i>

01:08:21.561 --> 01:08:23.437
<i>I don't know what's beneath the surface.</i>

01:08:23.521 --> 01:08:24.940
<i>Maybe no one does.</i>

01:08:26.274 --> 01:08:30.195
<i>But I know it gives us
our deepest desires.</i>

01:08:31.196 --> 01:08:35.115
<i>The people then must have worshipped it</i>

01:08:36.117 --> 01:08:38.745
when they found out what it could do.

01:08:41.373 --> 01:08:42.791
<i>Temagami.</i>

01:08:44.376 --> 01:08:46.086
The deep water.

01:08:47.879 --> 01:08:50.966
<i>Temagami. Temagami.</i>

01:08:51.048 --> 01:08:53.927
The well has a wish of its own.

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:57.430
<i>Once the water is woken,
it will take a life.</i>

01:08:58.265 --> 01:09:02.269
<i>Someone has to pay
so the water can keep giving.</i>

01:09:02.352 --> 01:09:04.145
<i>The way it gave to me.</i>

01:09:06.356 --> 01:09:08.275
Tommy was so sick.

01:09:13.071 --> 01:09:14.573
And look at him now.

01:09:19.452 --> 01:09:21.538
But what happened to your daughter?

01:09:22.038 --> 01:09:23.039
It was...

01:09:24.039 --> 01:09:26.251
better with Rebecca,

01:09:27.002 --> 01:09:29.337
more humane for a child

01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:31.131
not to know

01:09:32.507 --> 01:09:33.842
what was coming.

01:09:35.468 --> 01:09:37.178
Mom! Help!

01:09:37.262 --> 01:09:39.306
Mom! Mom!

01:09:43.727 --> 01:09:44.811
Mom!

01:09:44.895 --> 01:09:47.062
Becky? Becky!

01:09:47.146 --> 01:09:49.441
Mom! Mom!

01:09:49.524 --> 01:09:51.443
- Help!

01:09:51.526 --> 01:09:53.069
Mom, Becky's outside!

01:09:53.153 --> 01:09:55.530
Mom! Mom!

01:09:56.615 --> 01:09:58.158
Mom!

01:09:58.241 --> 01:10:00.619
Mom, Becky's outside!

01:10:01.161 --> 01:10:04.456
<i>The water used me as a vessel</i>

01:10:04.539 --> 01:10:07.125
<i>to do what must be done.</i>

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.046
<i>Don't worry about your husband.</i>

01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:14.549
He's the one who gets the wish.

01:10:15.258 --> 01:10:16.551
He gets his health.

01:10:16.635 --> 01:10:18.303
I got my son back.

01:10:18.386 --> 01:10:19.804
It'll be worth it.

01:10:20.472 --> 01:10:21.473
You'll see.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.352
Love requires sacrifice.

01:10:25.435 --> 01:10:27.187
That's not love.

01:10:29.064 --> 01:10:32.484
It's not a sacrifice
if you get something back.

01:10:33.068 --> 01:10:35.487
Rebecca asked where you were.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.199
She's still looking for you.

01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:41.326
You can still help us.

01:10:41.785 --> 01:10:44.412
There has to be some way to stop this.

01:11:25.954 --> 01:11:28.707
It'll be over soon.

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:34.045
The water will sleep again.

01:11:36.882 --> 01:11:38.091
And...

01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:41.761
someone else will find the house.

01:11:43.388 --> 01:11:47.809
Someone else who needs its help.

01:12:40.946 --> 01:12:42.948
Thanks, Ronin. See you tomorrow.

01:12:45.825 --> 01:12:47.827
Hey, Mom, Dad, we're home.

01:12:50.664 --> 01:12:51.998
- Mom?

01:12:54.042 --> 01:12:55.502
Dad, we're home.

01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:01.299
She's not answering.

01:13:02.217 --> 01:13:03.843
Think Dad might be with her.

01:13:04.928 --> 01:13:06.471
I'm gonna go check the garage.

01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:22.821
Cider?

01:13:35.375 --> 01:13:36.543
Cider?

01:13:41.715 --> 01:13:43.049
Come here, Cider.

01:13:57.272 --> 01:13:58.565
Come here, Cider.

01:14:12.078 --> 01:14:13.455
What?

01:14:23.423 --> 01:14:24.507
Cider?

01:14:39.606 --> 01:14:41.149
- It's okay, buddy.

01:14:42.067 --> 01:14:43.151
I'm right here.

01:15:19.813 --> 01:15:21.022
Cider?

01:15:36.246 --> 01:15:37.581
Elliot!

01:15:42.085 --> 01:15:45.088
Elliot! Elliot!

01:15:58.226 --> 01:15:59.269
Mom.

01:15:59.352 --> 01:16:01.229
- Come on. Okay, okay.
- Izzy, help me. Come on.

01:16:11.072 --> 01:16:13.199
I don't know what happened.
I don't know... Elliot's down there.

01:16:13.283 --> 01:16:14.701
- All I know is that he...
- Go in the house.

01:16:14.784 --> 01:16:17.203
- Call for help. Go!
- Okay. Okay, I'm going.

01:16:29.216 --> 01:16:30.467
Dad!

01:17:38.201 --> 01:17:39.411
Dad?

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.680
- Dad!
- There you are.

01:18:00.765 --> 01:18:02.434
I've been looking for you, Iz.

01:18:04.269 --> 01:18:05.937
- What's the matter?

01:18:18.116 --> 01:18:20.744
Okay, I'm... I'm calling for help.

01:18:25.582 --> 01:18:27.083
-  Don't do that!

01:18:47.979 --> 01:18:50.565
- I know you want me to get better.

01:18:52.567 --> 01:18:54.152
You understand, don't you?

01:18:56.238 --> 01:18:57.906
We have to get help.

01:18:57.989 --> 01:18:59.991
Baby, we already got help.

01:19:02.953 --> 01:19:04.913
Life is too hard for Elliot.

01:19:06.206 --> 01:19:07.415
It's better this way.

01:19:13.630 --> 01:19:15.632
No! No!

01:19:22.514 --> 01:19:25.559
Help! Help! Help!

01:19:25.642 --> 01:19:26.810
Marco.

01:20:20.405 --> 01:20:21.740
Help!

01:20:22.407 --> 01:20:24.409
Please! Help!

01:20:24.534 --> 01:20:26.745
Is anyone out there? Call for help!

01:20:35.837 --> 01:20:37.172
Marco.

01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:48.683
<i>Take me out to the ball game</i>

01:20:48.808 --> 01:20:52.562
<i>Take me out with the crowd</i>

01:20:52.687 --> 01:20:56.066
<i>Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack</i>

01:20:56.191 --> 01:20:57.943
<i>I don't care...</i>

01:21:02.989 --> 01:21:06.201
- You're supposed to say "Polo."

01:22:25.989 --> 01:22:29.409
Why don't you stay here,
and it'll all be over soon?

01:22:44.966 --> 01:22:46.134
Ellie.

01:22:48.136 --> 01:22:49.763
Oh, God. Come on.

01:22:49.846 --> 01:22:51.097
Come on, Ellie. Come on.

01:22:51.181 --> 01:22:54.226
One, two, three, four, five.

01:22:54.309 --> 01:22:56.228
Come on. Come on.

01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:01.691
It's too late.

01:23:04.653 --> 01:23:06.363
Love requires sacrifice.

01:23:06.988 --> 01:23:08.406
Ray.

01:23:09.616 --> 01:23:11.034
Oh, Ray, please.

01:23:11.117 --> 01:23:13.119
Please, we need to get him
to a hospital, Ray.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.622
He needs your help. Look at him.

01:23:23.004 --> 01:23:25.257
The water chose him.

01:23:27.175 --> 01:23:28.593
He loves the pool.

01:23:29.177 --> 01:23:30.971
Elliot will always be here.

01:23:31.054 --> 01:23:32.681
He'll always be here.

01:23:52.325 --> 01:23:53.326
<i>Dad.</i>

01:23:55.453 --> 01:23:56.997
<i>Something has you.</i>

01:23:58.331 --> 01:23:59.583
<i>You have to fight it.</i>

01:24:01.710 --> 01:24:04.796
<i>It's going to take sacrifice,
but you can have a good life together.</i>

01:24:05.297 --> 01:24:07.632
<i>I just need to know
that you want that, too.</i>

01:24:07.716 --> 01:24:09.050
<i>Please come back.</i>

01:24:09.134 --> 01:24:10.427
<i>I want that, too.</i>

01:24:10.510 --> 01:24:11.970
<i>Elliot needs you.</i>

01:24:15.348 --> 01:24:16.433
Ray?

01:24:16.516 --> 01:24:17.726
Come back.

01:24:18.268 --> 01:24:20.395
Come back. Come back.

01:24:29.905 --> 01:24:31.448
Izzy, no. Izzy...

01:24:37.746 --> 01:24:38.872
Yeah, it's me.

01:24:39.414 --> 01:24:40.790
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:24:40.874 --> 01:24:42.626
Mom.

01:24:43.043 --> 01:24:44.502
Ellie!
- Is he okay?

01:24:44.586 --> 01:24:47.380
He's breathing.
We gotta get him out of here.

01:24:49.257 --> 01:24:51.635
Come on. Come on, baby.

01:24:53.178 --> 01:24:54.512
Dad, come on. Let's go.

01:24:56.181 --> 01:24:58.016
<i>Temagami.</i>

01:25:07.984 --> 01:25:09.736
Dad?

01:25:10.487 --> 01:25:12.322
- Oh, my God. Mom?

01:25:16.493 --> 01:25:17.869
Baby, what's wrong?

01:25:19.704 --> 01:25:21.289
Elliot.
- Mom, it's the water.

01:25:21.373 --> 01:25:22.874
It's not gonna let him leave.

01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:25.418
Ray, it's... It's getting worse.

01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:30.173
Get him up, Izzy. Help me.

01:25:31.841 --> 01:25:33.260
Someone has to pay.

01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:54.656
Dad?

01:25:57.576 --> 01:25:58.785
Dad, where are you going?

01:25:58.910 --> 01:26:00.245
Don't look back.

01:26:04.666 --> 01:26:05.667
Ray?

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:07.168
Dad!

01:26:08.712 --> 01:26:09.713
Dad!

01:26:39.659 --> 01:26:40.660
Ellie!

01:26:42.454 --> 01:26:43.622
Are you okay?

01:26:43.705 --> 01:26:45.165
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

01:26:46.166 --> 01:26:47.167
I'm good.

01:26:47.250 --> 01:26:48.418
I'm okay.

01:26:48.501 --> 01:26:49.669
Where's Dad?

01:27:02.807 --> 01:27:03.934
I got you.

01:27:04.059 --> 01:27:05.060
Okay.

01:27:05.143 --> 01:27:06.811
Okay.

01:27:33.838 --> 01:27:35.382
<i>Hey, Eve, kids.</i>

01:27:37.050 --> 01:27:38.218
<i>Um...</i>

01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:42.973
<i>I don't know
what's gonna come of all this,</i>

01:27:43.848 --> 01:27:46.184
<i>but I just feel like
I still got something to prove.</i>

01:27:47.435 --> 01:27:48.645
<i>You know, and...</i>

01:27:49.479 --> 01:27:51.106
<i>I want to make you proud.</i>

01:27:54.359 --> 01:27:56.278
<i>Baseball's always just come easy to me.</i>

01:27:57.571 --> 01:28:01.199
<i>And... the other stuff, not so much.</i>

01:28:03.785 --> 01:28:05.036
<i>So...</i>

01:28:06.746 --> 01:28:08.164
<i>I guess I just...</i>

01:28:09.791 --> 01:28:11.376
<i>wish I knew a better way</i>

01:28:12.544 --> 01:28:14.379
<i>to let you know how much you mean to me.</i>

01:28:18.842 --> 01:28:20.010
<i>Love you.</i>

01:28:29.311 --> 01:28:30.645
This yours?

01:28:36.026 --> 01:28:38.028
You know, we could still sell the house.

01:28:39.487 --> 01:28:40.822
I mean, we could go anywhere.

01:28:44.117 --> 01:28:47.537
But then it's going to happen
to someone else, isn't it?

01:28:49.748 --> 01:28:51.166
Dad wouldn't want that.

01:29:47.722 --> 01:29:51.434
<i>Can you speak, can you call my name?</i>

01:29:51.977 --> 01:29:53.311
<i>Take my hand</i>

01:29:53.395 --> 01:29:56.731
<i>Maybe we could be together somehow</i>

01:29:56.815 --> 01:30:00.193
<i>Jumping in, but I'm so afraid</i>

01:30:00.986 --> 01:30:05.574
<i>I feel the rush,
but I'm rising to the surface now</i>

01:30:05.699 --> 01:30:09.160
<i>But you say go deeper</i>

01:30:09.286 --> 01:30:11.454
<i>Go deeper</i>

01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:15.250
<i>Take me deeper into your love</i>

01:30:15.375 --> 01:30:18.378
<i>You say go deeper</i>

01:30:18.503 --> 01:30:20.714
<i>Go deeper</i>

01:30:20.839 --> 01:30:24.467
<i>Fall deeper into me</i>

01:30:24.593 --> 01:30:27.971
<i>Take me deeper</i>

01:30:29.264 --> 01:30:34.144
<i>Drag me down to the other side</i>

01:30:34.269 --> 01:30:37.230
<i>Pull me under</i>

01:30:38.481 --> 01:30:43.153
<i>Fill my lungs with your memories</i>

01:30:43.278 --> 01:30:46.364
<i>How is it real?</i>

01:30:46.489 --> 01:30:49.868
<i>I can hear your heart through the screams</i>

01:30:49.993 --> 01:30:51.912
<i>And it's calling me</i>

01:31:02.047 --> 01:31:05.383
<i>Take me deeper</i>

01:31:06.635 --> 01:31:11.431
<i>Drag me down to the other side</i>

01:31:11.514 --> 01:31:14.559
<i>How is it real?</i>

01:31:14.684 --> 01:31:18.063
<i>I can hear your heart through the screams</i>

01:31:18.188 --> 01:31:21.483
<i>And it's calling me deep</i>
