WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:09.135
is to guard life.

00:09.218 --> 00:13.556
These trials will test
speed, strength...

00:14.974 --> 00:16.767
and your response to danger.

00:17.893 --> 00:20.688
Wearing the red swimsuit
is a privilege.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.607
We stand on
the sun-kissed shoulders

00:23.691 --> 00:26.193
of the greats

00:26.277 --> 00:27.820
Pamela Anderson.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.405
David Hasselhoff.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.991
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

00:32.074 --> 00:33.367
Yup.

00:33.451 --> 00:34.827
Are we ready?

00:36.203 --> 00:37.663
Set...

00:45.087 --> 00:47.006
Swim! Swim! Swim!

00:47.089 --> 00:49.967
- Come on!
- Bring it, girls!

00:50.050 --> 00:52.303
- Come on, girls, come on!
- Keep breathing!

00:55.306 --> 00:58.225
Why is everyone so amped for
lifeguarding certifications?

00:58.309 --> 01:00.603
'Cause, man!
Lifeguards rule the beach.

01:00.686 --> 01:03.147
They got the cash,
they got the bods,

01:03.230 --> 01:05.274
they got unlimited access
to the Boathouse.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.942
I'm sorry,
were you a lifeguard?

01:07.026 --> 01:09.236
No. My love handles
and Maisy being captain

01:09.320 --> 01:12.031
- meant that was never to be.
- You barely sound bitter.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.825
Yeah, I know. I need
a new emotional diuretic.

01:14.909 --> 01:17.536
But we're celebrating,
because of Ulrika and the board

01:17.620 --> 01:19.663
are voting against
Maisy's reno.

01:19.747 --> 01:23.417
- So you finally beat Maisy!
- Yes, but ladies don't brag.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.420
Come on, Killian!

01:27.630 --> 01:29.757
Come on, girls!
Haul ass!

01:29.840 --> 01:31.383
Go hard!

01:31.467 --> 01:33.260
That should be you out there.

01:33.344 --> 01:36.263
Oh, I know. I'm three seconds
faster than Killian.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.849
- Yes, you are.
- But he can have it this year.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.602
"This year"?

01:41.685 --> 01:43.312
As in,
there's gonna be a next year?

01:43.395 --> 01:45.189
Ah, I don't know.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.358
There's no sport
in beating the Quads.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.151
- Mmm?
- And if you run Maisy

01:49.235 --> 01:51.695
off the lake,
Killian goes too.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.364
He's a part of the set.

01:55.533 --> 01:56.700
Fine.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.702
<i>When</i> I get the cottage,

01:58.786 --> 02:00.704
we will workshop
your cottage-share idea.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.665
- For real?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.625
You're making me a better
person and it's disgusting.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.878
It looks like
Killian's leading.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.421
- I'm gonna go watch up close.
- Okay.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.299
I was so stanning
her and Olive...

02:12.383 --> 02:14.093
I want to introduce
you to someone.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.804
This is Gilson Fishburne,
our local county councillor.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.764
- Oh.
- And he's running for mayor.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.100
- Oh!
- This is Justin Lovejoy,

02:21.183 --> 02:23.435
my stepfather's son.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.312
- Yeah, hello.
- Gil.

02:25.396 --> 02:27.731
- Gil "The Thrill."
- Oh, dear.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.818
Will you be joining us tonight
at Maisy's farmhouse cookout?

02:31.694 --> 02:33.737
- ...Farmhouse cookout?
- Yeah, I thought

02:33.821 --> 02:35.573
it would be a fun theme
for a fundraiser.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.825
I'm also helping
with Gil's campaign.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.411
And I'm learning so much
about local law.

02:40.494 --> 02:44.582
Like, a farmhouse can actually
be bulldozed without a permit!

02:44.665 --> 02:46.709
And architecture
is so subjective.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.295
Who's to say what's a cottage,
what's a farmhouse?

02:49.378 --> 02:51.881
Actually, I do.
I make that decision.

02:51.964 --> 02:55.342
- Yes, yes you do!

02:57.678 --> 03:01.181
So how does our new Boathouse
president feel about this idea?

03:01.265 --> 03:03.934
Ulrika gave us
the green thumbs-up.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.020
- Oh!
- Yes! It turns out

03:06.103 --> 03:08.063
some of her garden's
more exotic crops

03:08.147 --> 03:09.773
don't have
the necessary paperwork,

03:09.857 --> 03:13.402
but Gil here was kind enough
to let that slide.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.778
Glad I could be of help.

03:15.446 --> 03:17.197
Well, it's an election year.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.116
Gotta go press some flesh.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.077
- Interesting choice of words.
- That's right. Bye.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.913
Take care.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.332
That's why you gave Ulrika
your spot in the election!

03:26.415 --> 03:28.334
That's why you did it,
because you knew that you could

03:28.417 --> 03:30.336
use Gil to screw her.
But if you lost to Wayne,

03:30.419 --> 03:32.046
you would've actually
been screwed. Ha!

03:32.129 --> 03:33.756
- Uh, whoa! I just--
- <i>And our new</i>

03:33.839 --> 03:37.134

<i>Killian Lin!</i>

03:37.217 --> 03:39.428
- No!

03:39.511 --> 03:41.847
- Way to go, baby! Woo!

03:41.931 --> 03:43.140
Oh,
I'm so proud of you!

03:44.266 --> 03:46.101
Oh, come to
the cookout tonight.

03:46.185 --> 03:49.355
It'll be fun! We'll be
celebrating Killian's victory.

03:50.481 --> 03:53.484
And... mine too, I guess!

03:54.735 --> 03:56.820
She always wins.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.031
She always fucking wins!

04:06.580 --> 04:10.542
Killian Lin!
You are now a Junior Lifeguard.

04:10.626 --> 04:12.795
Here are the keys
to the Boathouse.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.880
You are guarding the Bifrost

04:14.964 --> 04:17.007
so that only
true heroes may enter!

04:17.091 --> 04:19.301
Also Riley,
he has a spare set.

04:19.385 --> 04:22.680
I'll guard them
with my... uh, Thor.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.806
- Good!

04:24.974 --> 04:27.726
The Boathouse's first
Chinese-Canadian

04:27.810 --> 04:30.562
Junior Lifeguard!
I'm so proud of you!

04:30.646 --> 04:34.108
My boy's breaking barriers like
his dad broke bones on the ice!

04:36.860 --> 04:38.779
Okay, I'm gonna go
hang out with Billie now.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.739
You're coming with me!

04:40.823 --> 04:43.742
Don't be late for the cookout!
You're the guest of honour.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.079
- Bravo!
- So, how much did this

04:47.162 --> 04:48.831
little farmhouse loophole
cost us, babe?

04:48.914 --> 04:51.667
I offered my services as
an expert brand manager

04:51.750 --> 04:53.210
for Gil's campaign!

04:53.293 --> 04:55.212
And the cash for
one of our bathrooms.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.922
The one with the butt fountain?

04:57.006 --> 04:59.550
It's called a bidet, honey.
It's French.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.719
Ugh!
Can't we lose something else?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.303
The sauna?

05:03.387 --> 05:05.764
You know my hockey injuries
are only soothed

05:05.848 --> 05:07.725
by steam and
Alaskan yellow cedar.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.436
- Right.
- How about Opal's walk-in?

05:10.519 --> 05:12.104
Only if you're
the one to tell him.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.774
- This is Justin's fault.

05:15.858 --> 05:18.318
He cost me the election.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.947
Stay frosty.

05:25.701 --> 05:29.413
Where the frick are my carbs?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.878
- I wouldn't.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.713
It's been a really
rough morning.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.548
Those-- those have been there
since before my time.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.181
Want some sour cream
and listeria chips?

05:48.307 --> 05:51.268
No. And why are
we eating our feelings?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.729
- Because,

05:53.812 --> 05:56.148
my stepsister is gonna
bulldoze my family cottage

05:56.231 --> 05:58.233
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.612
I'm sorry. That... sucks.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.906
Yeah, it sucks.
Everything sucks.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.869
Whoopsie.
I swear, I turned Grindr off

06:08.952 --> 06:11.997
- when I came up to the lake.
- Never turn it off.

06:12.081 --> 06:13.874
Slim pickings up here.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.000
What's your handle?

06:15.959 --> 06:17.711
JustinTimbersnake91.

06:17.795 --> 06:19.421
- Okay.
- Yours?

06:19.505 --> 06:20.964
Riley.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.758
That tracks.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.096
What did I say?

06:27.179 --> 06:30.140
Shall we see what horny
truckers seek our company?

06:32.184 --> 06:33.560
- Huh.
- Ah...

06:33.644 --> 06:35.813
Bold choice,
posting his age.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.148
No, that's 4-3.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.692
- Dude's into threesomes.
- Oh...

06:40.776 --> 06:42.778
And "Mayor_Naise" is because
he's running for mayor.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.032
Did you hook up
with that Gil guy?

06:47.116 --> 06:49.201
- Ish. Ish!

06:49.284 --> 06:51.078
Again, very small pool.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.956
- Oh, God!
- Hey, no, no, no! No.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.499
You're okay.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.084
Do you want some real carbs?

06:57.167 --> 06:58.252
Always.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.295
I know the perfect place.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.840
You are fierce.
You're an animal!

07:02.923 --> 07:04.591
- You devour your prey

07:04.675 --> 07:06.218
and wait 30 minutes
before getting in the water.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.182
You know, you'll have to
watch your back next year.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.600
I'm thinking of trying out.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.352
That's if we're back next year.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.355
The new cottage
may not be finished yet.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.232
- Your reno's back on?
- Yeah.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.192
But I thought
the Boathouse Board nixed it.

07:22.276 --> 07:25.696
Nope. Mom found a loophole
because she's obsessed.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.489
It just sucks.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.491
My whole life's been
moving city to city

07:29.575 --> 07:31.535
'cause of my dad's hockey.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.704
Grandpa Derek's cottage was the
only place that never changed.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.416
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.711
Ugh. Lifeguard!

07:40.794 --> 07:44.339
Please. Go down to the beach
and get the other coolers

07:44.423 --> 07:46.425
and bring them to
the Lifeguard Lounge.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.803
Someone is coming to
test these fish in the morning.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.431
<i>- Skynda!</i> Please.
- Okay.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.433
Uh, hey!
Hang later?

07:54.516 --> 07:55.809
Yeah.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.401
What are the fish
being tested for?

08:04.484 --> 08:05.569
Herpes.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.989
There's an outbreak
over on Selkie Lake.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.408
We must act quickly to
make sure that the infection

08:11.491 --> 08:13.493
has not spread
to our fish stocks.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.829
What happens if
our fish have herpes?

08:15.913 --> 08:17.748
Do they call every fish
they've ever spawned with?

08:18.498 --> 08:23.253
No, we stop all activity
that slows the lake's recovery.

08:23.337 --> 08:28.175
Weeks of boats, waterskiing,
roadwork, construction--

08:28.258 --> 08:30.093
- Construction?
- Mm-hmm.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.347
Oh, and fish communicate
with farts, not phones.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.641
How would they text
with their tiny little fins?

08:42.814 --> 08:44.524
Fishing?

08:44.608 --> 08:46.109
Selkie Lake?

09:04.127 --> 09:05.879
You and gluten...

09:05.963 --> 09:07.798
why can't I quit you?

09:07.881 --> 09:10.425
Hey, Jayne. Doin' okay?

09:10.509 --> 09:12.636
Everything was fine
until you showed up.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.429
Putting ideas in my head.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.223
"Why don't you
run against Maisy?"

09:16.306 --> 09:17.808
"Why did you settle for Wayne?"

09:17.891 --> 09:20.310
- I never said that--
- "Summer of Jayne"?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.145
This is summer of pain.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.565
My girls will never
make lifeguard captain now.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.110
Not with Killian lapping them.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.570
I won't let her
take it from us.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.323
The next time I see Maisy,
I'm gonna tell her--

09:33.407 --> 09:36.952
- Tell her what, Jayner?
- How excited I am

09:37.035 --> 09:39.705
for Maisy's cookout tonight!
I'm gonna make my crab cakes.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.040
- Everyone loves them.
- Lookin' forward to it.

09:42.124 --> 09:44.793
Touch less cilantro this time,
okay, Jayner?

09:44.876 --> 09:47.504
Hey, would you mind giving
J-spot and I a hot sec?

09:47.587 --> 09:50.215
Nailing down that gay vote,
hardest part of the campaign.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.011
- Cost me my presidency.
- Ooh.

09:56.305 --> 09:58.265
You know I can't vote, right?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.809
The only vote I want
from you is...

10:00.892 --> 10:04.521
Vrrt. Vrrt. Vrrt.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.523
You tappin' back, Timbersnake?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.275
- Why don't you tap Maisy's ass?

10:08.358 --> 10:09.901
You're already
way the hell up there.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.945
Oh, meow!
Kitty likes to scratch.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.574
I see why Maisy
brought in my big guns.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.367
- Oh--
- I see it all the time

10:17.451 --> 10:20.120
up here, J-spot. One kid
wants to knock the cabin down,

10:20.203 --> 10:22.039
the other one wants
to turn it into a museum,

10:22.122 --> 10:24.750
and here's poor little Gil.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.336
Actually not so little,
and surprisingly attentive--

10:27.419 --> 10:29.338
- Oh, God.
- Stuck in the middle,

10:29.421 --> 10:31.381
and all I want is
what's best for the lake.

10:31.465 --> 10:35.052
Okay. Well, as if you haven't
already made up your mind, Gil.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.721
I'm currently fielding
several counteroffers.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.140
Well, I don't have
Maisy's kind of cash.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.351
I take other currency.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.398
- I mean sex--
- Yes, that was clear.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.360
Thank you, but I have a date,

10:51.443 --> 10:53.695
and I don't want to make
any early withdrawals,

10:53.779 --> 10:55.739
if you know what I mean,
in case it goes well.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.824
If you include Riley,
we got a done deal.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.451
How did you know it was Riley?

10:59.534 --> 11:02.412
Gay-P-S.
Keeping the community together.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.039
- You wanna stick it to Maisy?
- Yeah.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.665
- I get to stick it to you.
- What?

11:05.749 --> 11:07.250
And then you're gonna
stick it to me,

11:07.334 --> 11:08.960
and then I'm going to
stick it to Riley.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.587
We don't have to decide
the order right now.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.838
Do we have a deal?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.302
Let's make a manwich!

11:18.845 --> 11:20.055
Don't do it.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.186
I think we may have a problem.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.855
Gil was all over
Justin this morning.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.732
We may have to prepare
for contingencies.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.150
Like?

11:32.234 --> 11:33.527
The juicing island.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.986
But we've already
given so much!

11:35.070 --> 11:36.780
I know, I know! I--

11:36.863 --> 11:39.908
Well, Gil does
take other currencies.

11:39.991 --> 11:42.494
Bitcoin? Stock options?

11:42.577 --> 11:44.246
Livestock.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.623
A blue chip,
like an ex-pro hockey player,

11:46.706 --> 11:49.126
may tip the balance
if we need to counter.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.879
It's no different
than the strap-on!

11:52.963 --> 11:54.297
It's just like we practiced.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.050
Listen, no pain, no stain.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.885
Right?

12:03.014 --> 12:06.935
Well, you are the cutest
fisherwoman I have ever seen!

12:07.018 --> 12:09.771
And that is the gayest plaid
I've ever seen.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.610
- Hi!
- Hi!

12:15.694 --> 12:17.237
<i>Oh, someone's in a good mood!</i>

12:17.320 --> 12:19.114
I'm going fishing
with a friend.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.783
- <i>Is that code?</i>
- No, actual fishing.

12:21.867 --> 12:25.871
- No fishiness on my watch.
<i>- And who is this friend?</i>

12:25.954 --> 12:28.248
Oh, just her cousin.
Totally age-appropriate.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.750
- Justin!
- I will give you some privacy.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.545
- It was lovely to see you.
- <i>Okay, bye, Justin!</i>

12:35.422 --> 12:37.883
Can I get some advice on
something? I have a quandary.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.594
<i>Oh, yes, please.</i>
<i>We love a good quandary.</i>

12:40.677 --> 12:42.721
Okay, so they're gonna
destroy something

12:42.804 --> 12:45.974
- that's always been here.
- <i>Like old-growth trees?</i>

12:46.057 --> 12:48.643
Totally, that.
So, where do we, like,

12:48.727 --> 12:50.896
stand on doing something
a little wrong

12:50.979 --> 12:54.149
to save something
like old-growth trees?

12:54.232 --> 12:56.985
<i>- We stand with you.</i>
<i>- Fight big lumber!</i>

12:57.068 --> 12:58.737
<i>Billie Bear,</i>
<i>I wish you could be here.</i>

12:58.820 --> 13:01.281
<i>- The sushi is so good.</i>

13:01.364 --> 13:02.616
<i>- Ready?</i>
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

13:02.699 --> 13:04.242
<i>Mmm!</i>

13:04.326 --> 13:06.411
Hey, did you know that
fish can get herpes?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.874
- Have fun in Kyoto!

13:17.214 --> 13:19.883
Oh, boy. Your dry cleaner's
gonna love you.

13:19.966 --> 13:23.136
What-- you were serious.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.472
I thought fishing
was code or something.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.350
Why does everybody think that?
I'm very literal.

13:28.433 --> 13:32.521
Here, let me help you. Which...

13:32.604 --> 13:34.814
- For you.
- Thank you.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.650
I better show you
how to cast, then.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.570
Okay, so first,
you've gotta pick the lure.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.741
Actually, no...

13:44.824 --> 13:46.493
let the lure pick you.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.956
I watched some
YouTube tutorials.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.378
Oh, my God.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.964
Fuck keto!

13:59.047 --> 14:01.633
- Do you two need to be alone?
- Don't judge me.

14:03.301 --> 14:06.137
Oh! It's gonna be Billie.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.098
She's very, very in--

14:09.558 --> 14:12.018
invested in our date.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.770
How is that whole...

14:13.853 --> 14:15.647
kind-of-being-a-dad
thing going?

14:15.730 --> 14:18.275
I don't know. Kinda weird.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.068
Kinda good.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.861
It's just the most time
we've ever spent together.

14:22.821 --> 14:23.905
She's a cool kid.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.492
- Very together.
- She is.

14:27.576 --> 14:30.495
Very together. Too together.
I sometimes worry, like,

14:30.579 --> 14:32.539
"Adderall valedictorian"
together.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.292
But listen,
I am way too fresh and dewy

14:35.375 --> 14:37.210
to be some
baby-bjorn-gayby-daddy who's

14:37.294 --> 14:39.379
just droning on about his kids.
I wanna know about you.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.880
So what's Riley about,
besides being

14:40.964 --> 14:43.091
the handiest man on the lake?

14:43.174 --> 14:45.635
I just do all that
to support my photography.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.971
Okay! She's an artiste, huh?

14:48.054 --> 14:50.599
So, what do you shoot?
Like, landscapes?

14:50.682 --> 14:52.767
Portraits?

14:52.851 --> 14:57.063
I use roadkill to recreate
iconic crime scenes from <i>CSI.</i>

14:57.147 --> 15:01.234
Roadkill Investigations."

15:01.318 --> 15:03.194
Is that, like,
fan fic, or, like...

15:04.487 --> 15:06.156
like, fur fic?

15:06.239 --> 15:08.658
It's to bring awareness
to the animals' deaths.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.493
- Yeah.
- Okay.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.661
Speeding kills.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.539
It's actually why
I brought you here.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.541
This is where I scout
most of my models.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.710
Hmm...

15:19.919 --> 15:21.630
- Wow.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.007
Uh...

15:24.090 --> 15:25.133
Great.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.304
So, uh, what's your, um...

15:29.387 --> 15:32.265
what's your spicy
Mayor_Naise story, huh?

15:32.349 --> 15:34.434
I met him.
Kind of cute in, like,

15:34.517 --> 15:36.394
a hot-for-vice-principal
sort of way.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.856
I almost hooked up
with him and his husband.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.900
- Oh!
- But, uh,

15:41.983 --> 15:44.361
Joe Rogaine there didn't
tell his hus-bear at first.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.154
Yikes.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.490
Which is why I prefer
sex parties over threesomes.

15:48.573 --> 15:49.949
- Yeah.

15:50.033 --> 15:51.534
It's far more democratic.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.411
Sure. Yeah. You've gotta
get the democracy going.

15:56.331 --> 15:57.957
Billie wants a picture
of the food truck.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.668
Do you wanna
take a selfie with me?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.294
Sure.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.426
She's gonna love it.

16:12.263 --> 16:15.684
Our presence is being
requested at Maisy's cookout.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.310
What do you mean?
You want to go now?

16:17.394 --> 16:19.813
Well, the sooner
we make an appearance...

16:19.896 --> 16:21.147
the sooner we can leave.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.357
Okay.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.986
Okay. Yeah. I'll just, um...

16:27.070 --> 16:28.863
We gotta-- we gotta leave.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.990
We gotta go.
We're gonna do this.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.537
Yeah, just start the car.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.375
Are those sores?

16:41.376 --> 16:42.919
Gross. Let's toss it back--

16:43.002 --> 16:45.296
- Oh, wait, no. I need it!
- For what?

16:45.380 --> 16:46.965
To, uh...

16:47.048 --> 16:48.717
find a cure.

16:49.551 --> 16:50.719
For fish herpes?

16:50.802 --> 16:52.387
Mm-hmm.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.222
There's not even
a cure for human herpes.

16:54.305 --> 16:57.308
Which is why we owe it
to the mouth sore community

16:57.392 --> 16:59.561
to explore all forms
of the disease.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.895
The cure is out there.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.649
- What--

17:04.733 --> 17:06.317
I'm trying to make it
look like our lake

17:06.401 --> 17:07.861
was infected with herpes.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.779
Ulrika said if
the fish had herpes,

17:09.863 --> 17:11.573
construction on
the lake would stop.

17:11.656 --> 17:15.076
And I know how much
our grandpa's-- ew...

17:15.160 --> 17:18.997
<i>your</i> grandpa's cottage
means to you.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.082
I thought maybe
this could save it.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.667
That's environmental sabotage.

17:22.751 --> 17:23.793
Yeah.

17:25.253 --> 17:27.046
I'm touched.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.798
Really.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.717
I wasn't gonna
actually infect the lake.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.302
Just swap out a fish

17:32.385 --> 17:34.137
that was going in
for testing with this one.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.014
But it's insane, so we can

17:36.097 --> 17:37.432
- just toss it back.
- Or...

17:40.059 --> 17:42.061
We could Greenpeace this shit.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.897
Let's do this.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.113
Hey!

18:03.249 --> 18:04.876
I'm watching you three.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.086
Hey, you two.
How are you?

18:09.339 --> 18:13.092
Oh! Becky-Sue,
Becky-Sue, Becky-Sue.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.720
Say goodbye to
Grandpappy's farm.

18:15.804 --> 18:19.265
Looks like the bank finally
called in Daddy's loan.

18:19.349 --> 18:24.437
Oh, well, hopefully this will
take care of Daddy's debts.

18:24.521 --> 18:28.066
Oh, actually, Becks,
the, uh, price has gone up...

18:28.149 --> 18:29.734
threefold,

18:29.818 --> 18:32.237
I'm fielding some
interesting counteroffers.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.948
Well, we're happy
to match any price.

18:35.031 --> 18:36.783
Maisy...

18:38.326 --> 18:39.786
that's what I love about you.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.918
- There goes our juicing island.
- And our custom clawfoot.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.963
Unless "three" means...

18:51.005 --> 18:53.049
- Oh...
- No, babes!

18:53.132 --> 18:55.301
We haven't had a threesome
since my rookie year.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.428
Don't you remember
our Tampa Bay Triangle?

18:57.512 --> 18:59.514
I barely remember
Tequila Bay Triangle.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.267
You did have a lot of
mescaline that night.

19:02.350 --> 19:05.854
Just sit back, relax,
and think of your sauna.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.233
No pain, no stain.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.901
Know what's better
than one fiddle?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.444
- What?
- Two fiddles.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.041
Love your scrunchie.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.839
I think there's more room
in the kitchen.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.675
Mm-hmm.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.803
- Sweet.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.431
Hey, sorry, babe.
Had to take a waz.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.683
Whoreen and Saggy Balls
are still in the shitter.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.977
Nobody wants my crab cakes!

19:46.811 --> 19:48.605
Our girls aren't lifeguards.

19:48.688 --> 19:53.359
And <i>you</i> let me wear
this stupid scrunchie!

19:54.485 --> 19:56.404
Hey,
I love your scrunchie, babe.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.823
And you know
I love your crab cakes.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.826
I used to be captain,

20:01.910 --> 20:04.078
until Maisy stole it from me!

20:05.872 --> 20:09.584
It was three to one
in our favour!

20:09.667 --> 20:11.628
Where did--
where did I go wrong?

20:12.962 --> 20:14.881
It's too much cilantro, babe.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.008
Okay? Just adjust
the ratios and it's fine.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.593
Our girls, babe.

20:20.178 --> 20:23.848
I failed them.

20:23.932 --> 20:26.601
Jaynie...
you are the greatest mom ever.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.686
Hey, our girls?

20:28.770 --> 20:31.856
They got your smokin' bod.
They got my super smarts.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.983
And one day,
they are gonna follow in

20:34.067 --> 20:36.152
their mom's MILF-y footsteps

20:36.235 --> 20:38.571
and they're gonna marry
a great guy-- or girl--

20:38.655 --> 20:39.697
like me.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.159
First time I saw you,

20:43.242 --> 20:46.037
I knew I was gonna spend
the rest of my night with you.

20:47.622 --> 20:48.748
Then you got pregnant.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.461
And I thought, "I'm pretty sure
she said she was on the pill."

20:53.544 --> 20:55.421
Then you said,
"I'm getting an abortion."

20:55.505 --> 20:58.675
Ugh, that's when I knew you
were the girl for me, Jaynie!

20:58.758 --> 21:01.469
And now six IVF treatments
later, here we are!

21:02.428 --> 21:05.181
So who gives a shit
if Killian won lifeguard

21:05.264 --> 21:07.225
or if Maisy still
looks fit as hell?

21:08.101 --> 21:10.478
You are my girl, Jaynie.
Forever.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.275
I-- I have to go.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.866
Whew. Check out the height
on that tushy.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.286
Gotta get me some Spanx.

21:41.509 --> 21:42.552
Ugh.

21:45.138 --> 21:48.433
Oh, God,
there's that hornt-up creep.

21:48.516 --> 21:51.477
Bleh. You know what
the worst part is?

21:51.561 --> 21:53.688
They're usually great in bed.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.940
Oh, God, curses!

21:56.899 --> 22:00.236
Sure, yeah. Nothing beats
a dirty hate-fuck, but--

22:00.319 --> 22:01.779
Threesomes are
a fourth-date thing?

22:03.573 --> 22:06.159
I thought we were vibing,
but, hey, if you want

22:06.242 --> 22:07.827
to have a three-way
with "Mayor_Naise"--

22:07.910 --> 22:09.787
We are, we are.
We're-- we're vibing.

22:09.871 --> 22:12.498
There's-- there's total vibes.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.167
It's just that, um--

22:14.250 --> 22:16.085
Oh!

22:16.169 --> 22:17.879
- Hello.
- Hello.

22:17.962 --> 22:20.214
Shit. Just give me a sec, okay?

22:22.467 --> 22:24.010
Don't go anywhere.

22:25.887 --> 22:28.723
Oh, look who finally decided
to show up to the party.

22:28.806 --> 22:32.060
You just missed it. Maisy made
a huge donation to my campaign.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.561
Oh!

22:33.644 --> 22:36.439
I'm gonna miss this old barn.

22:36.522 --> 22:40.234
Justin, I am so pleased that
you and Riley showed up.

22:40.318 --> 22:41.611
Enjoy the crab cakes.

22:42.737 --> 22:45.156
What the fuck, Gil?
We had a deal!

22:45.239 --> 22:47.033
It was just feeling like
you weren't gonna deliver.

22:47.116 --> 22:50.328
Oh, I deliver.
I can Pony Express-deliver.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.413
I just thought that I had
a little bit more time.

22:52.497 --> 22:54.707
Well, now that Maisy's
fat check is burning a hole in

22:54.791 --> 22:59.295
my back pocket, time is not an
asset you have, Ponyboy. But...

22:59.378 --> 23:01.464
If you and Riley
want to get funky in the bunky

23:01.547 --> 23:04.759
in about ten minutes, I'll see
to it that Maisy won't be able

23:04.842 --> 23:07.178
to screw in so much
as a lightbulb

23:07.261 --> 23:10.681
unless I give her a permit
in this town. Or else...

23:10.765 --> 23:12.892
Beep. Beep. Beep.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.477
"Oh no, my cottage.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.521
No, not my cottage.
Not the cottage!"

23:21.943 --> 23:23.111
That's not my voice.

23:23.945 --> 23:25.780
- Oh!
- Family always helps.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.448
Staff uniforms
are in the kitchen.

23:27.532 --> 23:28.991
Opal, I'm not--

23:29.075 --> 23:31.410
- <i>Ándale!</i>
- God...

23:38.000 --> 23:40.336
I'm sorry, Jaynie.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.214
I let you and
the dance crew down.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.216
We had such dreams...

23:45.299 --> 23:48.427
Cosmetology, real estate...

23:48.511 --> 23:50.513
advanced cosmetology.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.099
Can you ever forgive me?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.112
Should we put him
with the others?

24:06.195 --> 24:08.156
No. What if the others
don't have herpes?

24:08.239 --> 24:10.324
Mmm... take out
one of Ulrika's fish

24:10.408 --> 24:12.076
and put Herpie Hancock
in instead.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.744
Aww, you named our fish?

24:13.828 --> 24:15.621
Shut up.

24:15.705 --> 24:17.290
Okay. Uh...

24:20.668 --> 24:22.086
There are no empty coolers,

24:22.170 --> 24:23.546
so where do we put
the clean fish?

24:25.339 --> 24:27.049
Back in the lake.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.302
Then we make our little
Herpie Hancock comfy here,

24:29.385 --> 24:31.137
and we have ourselves
an outbreak!

24:33.055 --> 24:36.142
Jailbreak's what you're in for
when I tell your parents!

24:36.225 --> 24:38.644
You two need to come with me.

24:43.858 --> 24:45.610
Oh, yee-haw!

24:45.693 --> 24:49.238
I, uh... I could get into
this little roleplay.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.865
Well, I hope so,

24:50.948 --> 24:52.950
'cause what I was
trying to say earlier was...

24:53.034 --> 24:56.287
um... I-- I--

24:56.370 --> 25:00.208
I haven't had sex
in such a long time,

25:00.291 --> 25:01.751
and I am so
freaked out about it.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.753
Aw, it's like riding a bicycle.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.755
Yes,
but my last bicycle had sex

25:05.838 --> 25:07.757
with 24 other bicycles
and fat-shamed me.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.093
We don't have to have sex.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.929
No, no, no, I wanna
have sex with you, Riley.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.097
I wanna have sex with you.
I wanna have so much sex.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.933
It's just that I don't
want my first time in--

25:17.016 --> 25:20.269
let's just round down
to a year-- to be bad.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.897
Not if it's with somebody that
I like, 'cause then, honestly,

25:22.980 --> 25:25.316
I'm just gonna get
so in my head about it.

25:25.399 --> 25:28.903
But I was thinking that maybe
if there was, like, a...

25:28.986 --> 25:31.030
if there was, like,
a buffer, you know?

25:31.113 --> 25:33.699
Like, a buffer boy who could
just kind of get between us

25:33.783 --> 25:36.744
or under us, whatever, just to
take some of the pressure off!

25:36.827 --> 25:39.830
Are you asking me to have
a threesome on our first date?

25:39.914 --> 25:44.418
Yes. But only because
I really, really like you.

25:44.502 --> 25:47.505
Everyone, if I could
just get your attention.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.049
I want to make a toast

25:50.132 --> 25:54.845
to new beginnings, and
to the lake's future mayor.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.847
I'm a simple man,

25:56.931 --> 25:58.849
a simple man,
a simply handsome man

25:58.933 --> 26:01.060
with a full head of hair.
All mine.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.938
- I have a dream...
- I'll do it.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.023
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

26:06.107 --> 26:09.026
You know, working with death a
lot makes you appreciate life,

26:09.110 --> 26:12.321
and sex is the one thing
we get for free.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.323
So...

26:14.407 --> 26:18.369
Hey, second date,
full sex party.

26:20.454 --> 26:22.999
- Lots of dicks.
- Thank you, Maisy,

26:23.082 --> 26:25.042
for your hospitality
and your vision

26:25.126 --> 26:28.462
for the revitalisation
of our lake. Hear, hear!

26:28.546 --> 26:30.006
- Hear, hear!
- I would also, uh,

26:30.089 --> 26:32.133
like to make a toast!

26:32.216 --> 26:36.345
We are... so excited

26:36.429 --> 26:38.806
to get behind a man

26:38.889 --> 26:42.059
who rises to a challenge.

26:42.143 --> 26:44.895
Adversity,
as they say,

26:44.979 --> 26:47.773
makes excellent bunk fellows.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.066
Yeah.

26:50.401 --> 26:52.820
To the thrill of Gil!

26:52.903 --> 26:54.739
- Yeah!
- The Thrill of Gil!

26:54.822 --> 26:56.782
- Yeah!

27:13.591 --> 27:16.177
Tight hip flexors can
really ruin a threesome.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.097
You know,
I wanna stretch it out.

27:20.181 --> 27:23.225
- ...Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:30.232 --> 27:34.070
- You okay?
- Yeah. So good, so good.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.323
You got a new bike to ride.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.325
- Yeah.
- Easy, breezy.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.619
- Squeeze me.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.875
Okay.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.419
- Daddy likes what he sees.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.131
I think talking's
not our friend here.

27:56.634 --> 28:00.304
I caught these two breaking
into the Lifeguard Lounge

28:00.388 --> 28:02.181
with this skanky little fish

28:02.264 --> 28:04.433
they were smuggling in
from Selkie Lake.

28:04.517 --> 28:08.270
They were trying to give
our lake herpes.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.565
Jayne, are you feeling okay?

28:11.649 --> 28:13.234
Did you use fresh crab?

28:13.317 --> 28:15.778
Go ahead.
Ask them.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.697
All right. Killian?

28:19.907 --> 28:22.284
I didn't want you to
tear down grandpa's cottage.

28:24.537 --> 28:28.290
No, it-- it wasn't his fault,
it was my idea. I, um...

28:28.374 --> 28:30.584
I tricked him
into coming with me.

28:30.668 --> 28:32.336
But as Boathouse staff,

28:32.420 --> 28:34.880
it was Killian's
responsibility.

28:34.964 --> 28:38.050
He must surrender the tank top.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.094
- The keys will be fine.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.012
Are you really going
to fire the Boathouse's

28:42.096 --> 28:43.764
first Chinese-Canadian
lifeguard?

28:43.848 --> 28:45.724
It was a mistake.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.560
This is not about race!

28:47.643 --> 28:49.854
This is about an individual.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.231
I am sorry, <i>kladdkaka.</i>

28:53.983 --> 28:55.025
Thank you.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.113
So now, the position
goes to, uh...

28:59.196 --> 29:00.573
eh, uh...

29:02.158 --> 29:04.076
I don't know any of
their names, just pick one.

29:07.955 --> 29:09.874
Okay, so,
next barbecue at our house?

29:09.957 --> 29:11.333
Celebrate the girls
getting lifeguard?

29:11.417 --> 29:13.752
I just have to
break it to Keri.

29:13.836 --> 29:16.297
Or Teri. Or Jeri.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.133
It's probably safer for
everyone if they just share it.

29:19.216 --> 29:20.342
Get over here.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.471
Great cookout!

29:26.932 --> 29:29.977
Okay, well, I'm gonna
leave this here for Maisy,

29:30.060 --> 29:32.771
and I will see you around.

29:32.855 --> 29:35.191
That's such a nice
colour on you. Okay.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.359
Yeah.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.613
What's, uh--
what's going on, J-spot?

29:40.696 --> 29:43.199
Why's the pole
at half-mast? Who died?

29:43.282 --> 29:44.825
It-- it was just there,
I swear.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.452
I was-- it was, like,
it was just there--

29:46.535 --> 29:47.953
- He was just there.
- I was there.

29:48.037 --> 29:49.747
I thought, uh,
sticking it to Maisy

29:49.830 --> 29:52.333
would've stiffened
your resolve.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.668
What does Maisy have--

29:56.170 --> 29:58.297
This was never about
riding the bicycle.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.216
No, no, wait, Riley, come on.
I'm sorry!

30:00.299 --> 30:02.218
I can explain if you--
Well, actually,

30:02.301 --> 30:03.636
you've pretty much got it all.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.056
This just became
a party for two.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.850
All right!
Sorry, Timbersnake.

30:09.934 --> 30:11.644
The deal was for three.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.271
Welcome to the farmhouse.

30:14.355 --> 30:17.399
- With "Mayor_Naise"?

30:17.483 --> 30:18.526
Damn it.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.070
Oh, there he is.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.405
Where were you?
I called and texted.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.199
I'm sorry, I was with--

30:25.282 --> 30:27.576
None of that matters.
What happened? What's wrong?

30:27.660 --> 30:32.581
Your birth daughter coerced
my son into committing a crime.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.500
Okay, take it easy, <i>Dateline.</i>

30:34.583 --> 30:35.918
I don't think that
Billie and Killian

30:36.001 --> 30:37.795
should see each other anymore.

30:37.878 --> 30:39.630
They obviously don't bring out
the best in each other.

30:39.713 --> 30:42.007
What are you talking about?
Billie's a great kid.

30:42.841 --> 30:45.761
Under the watch of
her parents, sure.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.846
But she obviously hasn't
had the best example

30:47.930 --> 30:51.725
- this summer, has she?
- I am really, really sorry.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.853
Do you ever
get tired of winning?

30:54.937 --> 30:56.689
Or being the fucking worst?

30:56.772 --> 30:58.983
Okay. Whoa.

30:59.066 --> 31:03.237
Billie, I am really sorry
that things went this way too.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.697
Please tell your parents that

31:04.780 --> 31:06.365
I'm a really big fan
of their work.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.620
You left me alone
with that sociopath

31:11.704 --> 31:13.455
- and I texted and texted you!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.916
I got caught up with Riley--

31:16.000 --> 31:17.876
It doesn't matter.
What happened?

31:17.960 --> 31:19.878
I was trying to help Killian.

31:19.962 --> 31:21.880
He loves
your stupid cottage too,

31:21.964 --> 31:24.466
so when Ulrika said that
if the lake had herpes,

31:24.550 --> 31:26.719
it would stop construction,
I thought if it looked like

31:26.802 --> 31:28.679
our lake was infected, then...

31:28.762 --> 31:31.640
- I don't know.
- Oh, my God.

31:31.724 --> 31:34.184
That's genius.

31:34.268 --> 31:37.187
Not so genius that we got
caught and Killian got fired!

31:37.271 --> 31:39.607
Yeah, but you were doing it for
someone that you care about!

31:39.690 --> 31:43.152
I'd have done the same thing.
I mean, here's dumbass me,

31:43.235 --> 31:45.029
I'm trying to stop the reno
by having a threesome

31:45.112 --> 31:47.364
with this slimy politician,
but your plan?

31:47.448 --> 31:49.908
Simple, elegant, scientific?

31:49.992 --> 31:53.704
Oh, my God.
Maisy was right.

31:53.787 --> 31:56.999
- You are a terrible influence!
- What?

31:57.082 --> 32:00.628
I will not be infected
by your herpes anymore!

32:00.711 --> 32:02.046
Billie!

32:04.048 --> 32:06.091
Looks like you lost
your canoe ride.

32:08.344 --> 32:12.222
Lucky for you, I, uh,
have a soft spot for roadkill.

32:14.183 --> 32:15.225
Come on.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.078
Thanks for the ride.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.875
I know it sounds insane,

32:39.958 --> 32:42.044
but I did it to
save the cottage for Billie.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.963
I mean, putting out for
your kid's real estate?

32:46.340 --> 32:48.384
That's gotta be
a parenting first.

32:49.218 --> 32:50.260
Yeah.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.930
I just wish you would've
been honest about it.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.975
All right.
So if I'd said,

32:57.059 --> 33:00.104
"Hey, will you bang
this skeezy guy with me

33:00.187 --> 33:02.731
to save our cottage?"
would you have done it?

33:04.608 --> 33:06.026
I hope you find a guy who'll

33:06.110 --> 33:08.195
suck a politician's dick
for you.

33:32.302 --> 33:33.345
Billie?

33:37.641 --> 33:39.518
Billie, I'm sorry. I--

33:39.601 --> 33:41.854
I will do better,
I will be better.

33:41.937 --> 33:43.772
I will be a better
birth father, or friend,

33:43.856 --> 33:45.232
or whatever it is that you--

33:45.315 --> 33:47.025
- He's trying, baby.

33:47.109 --> 33:49.695
I know, I know.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.780
- It's gonna be okay, honey.

33:51.864 --> 33:55.576
It's gonna be okay.
Tummy mummy's here.

34:00.247 --> 34:03.417
Shh. It's okay, sweetie.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.002
It's okay.
