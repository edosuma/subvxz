00:02.560 --> 00:05.080
Would you want to grow up here? 
 I have to.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.400
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.120
I was just an average kid 
 until my first day of Junior High.

00:11.840 --> 00:16.760
One minute I'm walking home, 
 the next, there's a crash

00:16.760 --> 00:19.760
and I'm drench in some weird chemical.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.200
And since then... 
 nothing's been the same.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.720
My best friend Ray 
 think it's cool.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.880
And my sister Annie 
 thinks I'm a science project.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.320
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.920
Not even my parents.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.000
I know the chemical plant 
 wants to find me

00:54.000 --> 00:55.800
and turn me into some experiment.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.160
But you know something?

00:57.160 --> 01:00.880
I'm guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.440
[school bell ringing]

01:03.440 --> 01:06.000
[Alex] 
 My english teacher, Miss Green?

01:06.240 --> 01:08.120
Turns out she's pretty cool.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.640
I also thought I would hate history 
 but now I think I'll like it a lot.

01:12.640 --> 01:15.720
Alex, two days ago 
 you were ready to drop out

01:15.720 --> 01:17.600
and get a job at burger bean.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.040
And now... 
 you're actually having fun.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.240
Oh, it's really disappointing.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.480
I'm sorry I started to enjoy it.

01:24.480 --> 01:28.080
Alex, I have a reputation 
 for being negative, but I'm not.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.440
I'm realistic.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.920
I know that whenever 
 you're feeling good

01:31.920 --> 01:35.400
there's always somebody 
 close by ready to spoil it.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.800
Hey!

01:36.800 --> 01:39.000
Check out the nap pack.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.560
- Why'd you take my ball? 
 - It's a free country.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.200
"A free country"? 
 I hate that.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.880
It's an excuse for anything.

01:46.880 --> 01:51.280
Well, we wanted to tell you guys 
 the elementary school called.

01:51.280 --> 01:54.440
There's a huge mistake. 
 They want you back

01:54.440 --> 01:56.800
in fifth grade... 
 where you belong.

01:56.800 --> 01:59.840
Hey, guys! 
 Coach is looking for you at practice.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.360
We're on our way. 
 We had to give these kids a message.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.640
Whatever she said 
 don't listen to her.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.480
[girls laughing]

02:07.720 --> 02:09.520
See you later, Scott.

02:10.199 --> 02:14.960
You're, uh... 
 Alexandra, right?

02:14.960 --> 02:17.960
You have to do something 
 about Jessica.

02:17.960 --> 02:21.480
Making fun of you is 
 part of her class schedule.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.800
She was making fun 
 of you, too, Ray.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.160
Yeah, but you're 
 the one she hates.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.840
Just give her 
 a nice zap in the butt.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.680
I told you, I can't do that.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.400
Annie says not to use 
 my powers in public.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.120
What does Annie know?

02:35.120 --> 02:38.560
Ray, I won't use the power 
 to get back at people.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.160
[zapping]

02:58.640 --> 03:01.960
- [all laughing] 
 - [screaming]

03:03.920 --> 03:05.560
[zapping]

03:06.320 --> 03:08.960
Not that I wouldn't like to.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.560
[Vince] It's a minor detail. 
 We'll find the child.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.120
[Atron] I cannot 
 be implicated in the process.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.000
It has nothing to do with you.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.920
Don't cloud your mind 
 with mundane problems

03:20.920 --> 03:23.680
like a kid sprayed 
 with a bit of chemical.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.880
A bit of chemical?

03:24.880 --> 03:27.400
That's not what 
 that truck driver said.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.880
Well, Dave has a tendency 
 to exaggerate.

03:30.880 --> 03:34.240
- We do not have a problem? 
 - We do not have a problem.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.280
I don't want to know 
 about this kid.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.720
- What kid? 
 - Thank you, Vince.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.520
Any chance today?

03:44.520 --> 03:47.400
Nope. 
 I still feel completely normal.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.440
Until I start concentrating.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.560
Hmm. 
 Let's start with liquefying.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.760
How long did you last yesterday?

03:54.760 --> 03:59.280
I think it was about 4 1/2 minutes.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.600
Yeah, 4:18.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.080
Okay, I'll just do 
 some measuring today.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.720
Off we go.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.000
Now, stretch out as far as you can.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.200
[bubbling]

04:29.920 --> 04:32.000
Who are you talking to?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.640
- Nobody. 
 - I just heard you.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.680
"Stretch out as far as you can."

04:37.680 --> 04:40.040
Oh, I was talking to myself.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.400
It's, uh, self-motivational technique.

04:43.400 --> 04:48.400
I was just, stretching my mind 
 as far as it would go.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.480
Really?

04:49.480 --> 04:53.800
Do you think you're spending 
 too much time alone in the garage?

04:53.800 --> 04:56.080
- [Alex] Ow! 
 - Ow!

04:56.080 --> 04:59.760
- Ow! I stubbed my toe. 
 - I'll help you clean this mess.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.400
No! I'll get it, Mom.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.120
In fact, 
 you've been working too hard.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.800
So I'll even do the laundry for you.

05:06.800 --> 05:09.480
Well, isn't this unusual?

05:09.480 --> 05:15.040
Well, I guess I should, 
 um, quit while I'm ahead.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.920
Definitely.

05:18.920 --> 05:21.200
Whew! Uh... colors...

05:23.120 --> 05:24.240
Bye!

05:24.240 --> 05:25.240
Bye.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.600
[Alex] That was close. 
 Next time lock the door.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.800
Sorry. 
 Alex, I've been thinking about it.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.800
How come, 
 after such a big accident

05:36.800 --> 05:39.840
we haven't heard 
 anything more about it?

05:39.840 --> 05:42.680
There was nothing in the papers...

05:42.680 --> 05:45.520
there's no talk at the plant.

05:46.280 --> 05:47.760
Somebody's covering up.

05:47.760 --> 05:50.240
I've got to find out more about it.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.640
Can I come back now? 
 I'm getting tired already.

05:53.640 --> 05:54.960
Sure. Come on back.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.680
We'll work on zappers for awhile.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.640
[Ray] I just got my report 
 on Hong Kong back.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.880
Nailed it. 
 Another "B"?

06:11.880 --> 06:13.120
You got it.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.320
I was really working 
 myself into an "A."

06:15.320 --> 06:18.680
But then I caught myself. 
 Saved it for the next one.

06:18.680 --> 06:22.280
One day you'll figure out 
 what you really want to do.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.520
You'll throw yourself into it. 
 No more saving it.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.920
Didn't I tell you?

06:26.920 --> 06:30.080
I've decided that basketball 
 in my future.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.840
The N.B.A. Beckons!

06:35.000 --> 06:37.040
[girls laughing]

06:39.120 --> 06:42.120
- You okay? 
 - [Jessica] Oh, no, my...

06:47.960 --> 06:51.280
[all laughing, screaming]

06:51.280 --> 06:54.320
[laughing, screaming continuing]

07:10.200 --> 07:12.000
[teacher] 
 Freeze!

07:13.560 --> 07:16.360
- Who's responsible for this? 
 - [Girl] Alex and Ray!

07:16.360 --> 07:18.760
- [Ray] Jessica and Ellen did it! 
 - [teacher] Of course!

07:18.760 --> 07:23.360
Since none of you will 'fess up 
 to what is right...

07:23.360 --> 07:26.040
the four of you 
 one, two, three, four

07:26.040 --> 07:30.280
will report to this cafeteria 
 at 1600 hours tomorrow!

07:30.280 --> 07:34.680
And you will clean up 
 this cafeteria... for a week!

07:34.680 --> 07:37.120
Do you understand?

07:37.480 --> 07:39.920
I can't hear you!

07:43.960 --> 07:46.840
You know it was your fault. 
 You tripped her!

07:46.840 --> 07:49.440
I can't help it 
 if she's uncoordinated

07:49.440 --> 07:51.280
and can't stay on her feet.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.720
Who are you calling uncoordinated?

07:53.720 --> 07:56.600
Alex is twice the athlete 
 you guys are.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.400
Ray.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.720
We challenge you. 
 Two on two on the b-ball court.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.200
Loser admits responsibility 
 to heller

08:04.200 --> 08:06.960
and cleans the cafeteria 
 by themselves.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.040
You're on. 
 Tomorrow, the basketball court.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.600
I can't wait. 
 You're so dead.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.720
Raymond, I'm a crummy player 
 and you know it!

08:17.720 --> 08:21.440
They're on the school team! 
 This will be humiliating.

08:21.440 --> 08:25.200
We'll end up cleaning 
 the whole cafeteria by ourselves!

08:25.200 --> 08:28.680
Alex! Will you relax, please? 
 I'm better than Jessica.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.920
And if you can just stop Ellen

08:30.920 --> 08:33.480
[quietly]: plus use 
 your powers when necessary

08:33.480 --> 08:37.200
- the game's in the bag! 
 - I told you, I won't use them.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.200
What do you think I'd do?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.720
Lift you ten feet up for slam dunks?

08:41.720 --> 08:43.159
One would be nice.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.800
Don't you think it might 
 be a little obvious?

08:45.800 --> 08:49.640
If there was a way to 
 teach them a lesson here it is.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.840
Forget it. 
 No, no way.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.880
- Alex, come... 
 - Forget it, Ray.

08:53.880 --> 08:55.640
Alex!

08:55.640 --> 08:58.320
[Mr Mack] 
 Now, Annie, Miss Atron has done

08:58.320 --> 09:00.720
wonderful things for Paradise Valley.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.640
Why do you have 
 a problem with her?

09:02.640 --> 09:04.960
- I don't trust her. 
 - I don't either, Dad.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.840
I mean, why she's always 
 smiling like that?

09:07.840 --> 09:11.800
She smiles so much 
 she's probably hiding nasty stuff.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.480
Nobody can accuse you two 
 of a lack of imagination.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.600
And what's wrong with smiling?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.480
I encourage her to smile.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.520
Honey, could you get us 
 more bread from the kitchen?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.600
Sure, Mom.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.960
Dad, whatever happened 
 to that GC-161 project

09:29.960 --> 09:33.280
that you were so excited 
 about awhile back?

09:33.280 --> 09:35.000
Honestly, I don't know.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.120
It went from being the hot plant 
 project to the back burner fast.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.160
I don't understand Danielle.

09:41.160 --> 09:44.200
One day we're progressing 
 the next day we stop.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.360
It's out of development.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.520
Dad, it's awhile 
 since I visited the plant.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.800
Could I maybe come 
 and visit you tomorrow?

09:56.800 --> 09:57.880
Absolutely!

09:57.880 --> 10:00.720
I am dying to show you 
 my new work station.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.720
- [doorbell ringing] 
 - I'll get it!

10:03.720 --> 10:05.280
[ringing again]

10:05.560 --> 10:07.920
Ready for some 
 round ball practice?

10:07.920 --> 10:11.440
Like it'll make a difference. 
 The game is tomorrow.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.640
I know, but I can take you 
 through the rules.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.840
[Alex] 
 This is the girl I have to stop?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.400
You can't stop Ellen.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.520
You can only hope to contain her.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.640
Ready to use your powers now?

10:51.440 --> 10:54.520
Then I guess this means 
 one thing come game time.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.760
Just give me the ball 
 and get out of my way.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.480
Normally, I keep the calculator 
 on my left side

11:13.480 --> 11:17.200
but if I'm working on the computer 
 I move it to the right.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.160
- That's great, Dad. 
 - Can I get you a little snack?

11:21.160 --> 11:25.320
On Fridays, the cafeteria 
 serves macaroni and cheese.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.960
No, I'm fine.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.920
Why don't you show me 
 your work on GC-161?

11:29.920 --> 11:32.320
I can't, it's under computer lock.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.280
Nobody can get to it... 
 without my password.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.200
Dad, you can show it to me.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.400
I'm your daughter, 
 I'm not going to tell anyone.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.360
No! I can't. 
 I can't show it to anyone.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.720
You're kidding, right?

11:45.720 --> 11:49.400
Sorry, Annie, "classified" 
 means "classified."

11:49.400 --> 11:51.680
[typing]

12:05.000 --> 12:09.760
- School never went this fast before. 
 - Yeah.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.920
[ringing]

12:26.720 --> 12:29.760
Take it out, Ray Dog.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.000
Ray Dog's ball, 21 wins. 
 Ready to lose?

12:44.480 --> 12:45.480
Yes!

12:46.480 --> 12:48.280
In your face.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.280
- Sorry, Ray. 
 - Don't worry, no apologizing.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.320
We'll get them next time.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.000
What if I guess your password?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.920
- Come on, Annie... 
 - "Barbara"?

13:14.920 --> 13:17.120
- No. 
 - "Annie," "Alex"?

13:17.120 --> 13:20.080
No, Annie, please 
 I have to be more creative

13:20.080 --> 13:24.440
with my password than that. 
 Can't I show you DX-17 instead?

13:24.440 --> 13:27.680
It's a whole new look 
 at the nucleolus organizer.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.640
Maybe I will have 
 some macaroni and cheese.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.800
Great!

13:31.800 --> 13:35.680
And when I get back 
 I can also show you

13:35.680 --> 13:39.560
some very interesting work 
 we're doing with linoleic acid.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.920
Brilliant you are. 
 Creative you ain't.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.120
"Barbara" backwards.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.480
Dad, I love you, but you 
 couldn't be more predictable.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.400
Print.

14:15.520 --> 14:19.080
- Hey, come on, Jessica! 
 - What?

14:19.080 --> 14:21.400
If it's a foul, call it.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.240
Otherwise, stop whining.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.400
We're up.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.600
- Eight to nine. 
 - We're dead, Ray.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.120
- They're too good. 
 - You're playing great, I just stink.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.400
No, but you know 
 how you can help us?

14:34.400 --> 14:36.960
Sorry, Ray, can't do it, 
 it'd be cheating.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.880
Why? Didn't you tell me

14:38.880 --> 14:42.480
- "No more saving it for the next one"? 
 - But this is different.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.640
This is a basketball game.

14:44.640 --> 14:48.040
Okay, then let's try 
 to stay with it, okay?

14:48.320 --> 14:49.880
Okay.

14:53.200 --> 14:57.120
- Oh, no. 
 - You're just delaying the inevitable.

14:57.120 --> 15:02.000
- You haven't won yet. 
 - We'll see about that.

15:02.000 --> 15:02.720
Check.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.960
- [Alex] Hey! 
 - [gasps]

15:09.960 --> 15:13.520
[Jessica] What are you 
 going to do about it, wuss?

15:16.040 --> 15:20.200
Well, first of all, 
 I'm going to call a foul.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.040
Our ball!

15:35.960 --> 15:37.480
Yes!

15:46.680 --> 15:49.400
[sizzling]

15:54.400 --> 15:57.760
- [Jessica] What are you doing? 
 - I just froze!

15:57.760 --> 16:00.560
[Alex] 
 18-11, you.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.720
A little cold, but still tasty.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.480
This is a really nice printer, Dad. 
 Does it work?

16:09.480 --> 16:13.200
Oh, sure, but the one I want 
 is in Miss Atron's office.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.040
It's reserved for classified material.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.240
- You mean...? 
 - They're afraid of documents

16:19.240 --> 16:21.840
getting distributed 
 to the wrong people.

16:21.840 --> 16:26.880
They print out in Danielle's office. 
 Danielle... Atron's office?

16:30.320 --> 16:32.480
[Woman] 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, excuse me!

16:32.480 --> 16:35.840
You're George Mack's daugter 
 Annie, aren't you?

16:35.840 --> 16:38.080
I'd recognize you anywhere.

16:38.080 --> 16:42.200
George is always bragging 
 about you by the water cooler.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.280
He was just telling me what 
 an amazing office Miss Atron has.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.920
Do you think that you 
 could show it to me?

16:48.920 --> 16:53.560
Well, I don't know... 
 and Vince wouldn't be too happy.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.600
But I don't see why not. 
 Come on, let's go.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.760
We'll be very quick.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.360
- [door beeps] 
 - Isn't this beautiful?

17:03.360 --> 17:09.200
It's a very upbeat kind of 
 atmosphere very warm quality...

17:09.200 --> 17:11.079
May I help you, young lady?

17:11.079 --> 17:15.280
- I was just showing her... 
 - That will be all, Miss Koch.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.880
You're Vince, right? 
 Head of Plant Security?

17:22.880 --> 17:26.440
- That's right. 
 - Oh, it's so cool to meet you.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.200
I'm George Mack's daughter--

17:28.200 --> 17:30.480
the research guy, 
 do you know him?

17:30.480 --> 17:33.360
I believe we've met before, Miss Mack.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.200
I just wanted to see this office.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.440
Ms. Atron is, like, 
 a personal hero to me.

17:40.440 --> 17:44.000
I hope to someday serve 
 in some capacity.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.040
- If I'm lucky. 
 - Yes, it is a privilege

17:47.040 --> 17:49.880
that only a few fortunate 
 people like myself

17:49.880 --> 17:52.560
have had the opportunity 
 to experience.

17:52.560 --> 17:56.920
- A privilege that has to be earned. 
 - [phone ringing]

18:00.160 --> 18:01.360
Vince. No.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.120
Absolutely not.

18:06.440 --> 18:12.480
I thought we discussed that matter. 
 I can't authorize that.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.640
Are you listening to me?

18:14.640 --> 18:18.040
Under no circumstances 
 will that happen.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.880
If it does, somebody's 
 going to get hurt.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.000
Wow!

18:25.000 --> 18:28.880
You're obviously very, very 
 good at what you do, Vince.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.160
Ms. Atron must feel very secure.

18:31.160 --> 18:35.920
I hope so. Thank you. 
 No, thank you.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.520
[cheering]

18:46.000 --> 18:47.920
[Ellen] 
 Watch your man, Jessica.

18:47.920 --> 18:52.560
- It's your man that's killing us. 
 - 20-19, us, point game.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.320
[crowd cheering]

19:13.000 --> 19:15.160
Get that weak stuff out of here!

19:54.760 --> 19:56.400
Yes!

19:56.400 --> 19:59.400
[all cheering]

20:01.840 --> 20:04.040
That was total luck!

20:05.720 --> 20:08.120
Hey, Alex, congratulations.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.600
Oh, thanks, Scott.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.960
You started off slow, 
 but what a finish.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.920
We reached deep inside 
 ourselves for that little extra.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.480
You should try out for 
 the Junior Varsity Team.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.320
Oh, I don't think so.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.360
Yeah, I was going to be 
 assistant coach this year.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.320
But I could think about it.

20:26.320 --> 20:30.600
Well, I better go console Jessica. 
 Nice game, guys.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.880
You won it fair and square.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.480
Dad! 
 My watch, the lipids watch--

20:38.480 --> 20:40.600
I must have dropped it somewhere.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.440
I had it when I went 
 into Danielle's office.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.080
What were you doing 
 in Danielle's office?

20:46.080 --> 20:49.280
Vince let me in. 
 I just wanted to see it.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.080
Ah, well, uh, the watch 
 must have fallen off.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.240
Uh, let's go get Vince.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.520
- We cheated. 
 - So did they.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.720
They fouled us up 
 and down the court.

21:03.720 --> 21:07.480
But when I skyed to knock Ellen's 
 shot away it was pure poetry.

21:07.480 --> 21:11.320
- I lifted you off the ground, Ray. 
 - Details.

21:11.320 --> 21:15.000
- You know what we have to go do? 
 - Go grab a victory soda?

21:15.000 --> 21:15.760
No.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.200
You'll admit to them that 
 you used your powers to win?

21:20.200 --> 21:23.840
- Of course not. 
 - We'll just have to do the right thing.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.480
- You're no fun! 
 - Oh.

21:26.480 --> 21:29.200
Yes, you are.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.840
That last shot you made 
 was incredible.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.960
- Didn't even use my powers. 
 - You didn't?!

21:35.960 --> 21:38.040
Well, maybe just a little.

21:38.960 --> 21:40.920
You've a very sweet daughter.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.200
As always, Vince, 
 you're very observant

21:43.200 --> 21:45.560
but don't let the niceness fool you.

21:45.560 --> 21:49.440
This girl plans on succeeding 
 Miss Atron one day

21:49.440 --> 21:53.680
as the C.E.O. of this plant. 
 Oh, is that so?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.920
[Annie] 
 Found it!

22:02.920 --> 22:05.280
We decided to help.

22:10.040 --> 22:12.560
It was supposed to be 
 this wonder drug

22:12.560 --> 22:16.160
that would let people eat 
 without gaining weight.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.840
What does that have to do 
 with me glowing

22:18.840 --> 22:22.760
- and turning into liquid? 
 - The intended dose was two drops.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.000
You got 1,000 times that much.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.960
There's no long-term 
 danger to your health

22:28.960 --> 22:32.320
but you sure have 
 some bizarre side effects.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.000
Why can't we tell anyone?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.840
Developing this chemical 
 was completely illegal.

22:36.840 --> 22:40.840
The people at the plant must 
 be out there looking for Alex.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.480
Don't worry, Alex.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.200
We won't let anything happen to you.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.840
No way. 
 My nobel prize is riding on it.

22:50.840 --> 22:55.280
[Ray] And now that you told us 
 all about this chemical stuff

22:55.280 --> 22:59.640
I think there's something 
 we could teach you.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.160
I doubt it.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.920
[Ray] 
 He scores, the crowd goes wild!

23:04.920 --> 23:06.920
Come on, Annie, take a shot!

23:06.920 --> 23:09.240
This is not my game.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.520
You're not kidding.

23:12.520 --> 23:15.360
Hey, Alex, lift me up 
 for one slam dunk, please?

23:15.360 --> 23:19.440
- No way, Raymond. 
 - Oh, take a shot, then.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.640
You used your powers 
 to put that in.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.520
I did not!
