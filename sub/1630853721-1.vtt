00:59.100 --> 01:02.228
<i>Scientists said</i>
<i>the world would end in 2036.</i>

01:03.521 --> 01:05.899
<i>Climate change, pollution.</i>

01:07.358 --> 01:08.943
<i>The oceans would boil.</i>

01:10.361 --> 01:13.364
<i>The air, you wouldn't</i>
<i>be able to breathe it.</i>

01:16.326 --> 01:18.536
<i>Billions of people would die.</i>

01:34.928 --> 01:36.221
<i>But they were wrong.</i>

01:42.018 --> 01:44.729
<i>The world ended a long time ago.</i>

02:06.376 --> 02:09.587
Three, two, one.

02:09.671 --> 02:12.465
-Happy birthday!
<i>-Happy birthday!</i>

02:12.549 --> 02:13.842
-Yay!

02:13.925 --> 02:16.302
-Are you having a good day?
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>

02:16.386 --> 02:18.221
<i>-Dad tried to make me waffles.</i>
<i>-Mm.</i>

02:18.304 --> 02:21.182
-Ooh, "tried"?
-<i>Well, there was an incident.</i>

02:21.266 --> 02:23.434
<i>-There was a fire.</i>
<i>-Small fire.</i>

02:24.227 --> 02:25.645
<i>Big fire.</i>

02:26.312 --> 02:28.857
Mm-hmm.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.401
I remember when I was nine.
My sister and I, we, uh…

02:32.610 --> 02:33.528
…went to Disneyland.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.445
<i>What's that?</i>

02:36.698 --> 02:40.076
Oh, it's, uh… It was a pretty fun place.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.244
<i>Can I go?</i>

02:41.327 --> 02:44.330
<i>Uh, Bea, uh, why don't you go</i>
<i>get your present to show Mom, huh?</i>

02:44.414 --> 02:46.416
Ooh, presents.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.168
-<i>It's a book.</i>
-Okay.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.588
-<i>I'll be right back!</i>
-What kind of a book?

02:51.671 --> 02:53.464
<i>Shakespeare.</i>

02:53.548 --> 02:54.966
-The Complete Works.
-Wait.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.178
When I left, she was still working
her way through <i>Wrinkle in Time.</i>

03:00.805 --> 03:03.516
<i>Well, it's been six months. Things change.</i>

03:07.562 --> 03:10.398
<i>-Oh, hey, I… I didn't mean…</i>
-No, it… It's fine.

03:11.482 --> 03:16.779
I know I've been gone too long.
I miss you guys so much.

03:20.742 --> 03:21.576
<i>Jade.</i>

03:26.414 --> 03:27.916
<i>Be careful.</i>

05:05.054 --> 05:07.473
Come on. Show me something.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.463
Day 167 of observation.

06:20.546 --> 06:25.385
Pack 2426 still shows
no sign of leadership structure

06:25.468 --> 06:27.345
or higher brain function.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.746
No.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.379
Damn.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.674
Six months.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.972
Fucking stupid!

11:12.797 --> 11:13.798
Shit. Stop.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.008
I really think you guys
are gonna love it here.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.928
Oh, and the school,
they have an amazing STEM program.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.514
Their team won Codefest last year, and…

11:22.473 --> 11:24.475
they've got kombucha on tap.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.649
Hmm.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.443
Watch it, man.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.418
One more shot.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.963
Hey, did you see those freaks in the park?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.299
Oh, you mean the normal people?
Like, walking around?

11:57.383 --> 11:59.552
Yeah, I saw them.
They looked fine.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.095
-Too fine.
-"Too fine"?

12:01.178 --> 12:04.306
And we're in South Africa,
but there's only, like, five Black people?

12:05.975 --> 12:07.685
This place is fucking weird.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.650
-The house is nice though.
-Yeah.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.278
If I burn it down, can we go home?

12:18.362 --> 12:19.280
Albert.

12:19.363 --> 12:23.743
-Ah! There you are.
-Carol, good to see you again.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.411
Aw.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.206
Jade, Billie, it's terrific
to finally meet you.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.833
-Fucking weird.
-You too.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.960
You're going
to absolutely love it here.

12:33.043 --> 12:35.755
Once you've settled, I'll take you
for a tour around the town center.

12:36.380 --> 12:40.342
I hope you love cupcakes.
We have five shops, and two are vegan.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.096
-Cool.
-Cool.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.432
I know the place is
a little smaller than what you're used to,

12:46.515 --> 12:48.476
but Cape Town's just an hour away.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.937
And, you know, last year, we were voted
best place to live in the world.

12:52.021 --> 12:52.980
By who?

12:53.063 --> 12:54.732
Lulu Lemon whores?

12:54.815 --> 12:56.400
Guys, that jerk off to CrossFit?

12:56.484 --> 12:58.152
-Elon Musk?

13:00.029 --> 13:02.156
-I don't--
-It's… it's a joke.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.034
Jade thinks she's funny.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.663
All right. Come on.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.418
-Can you just not?
-No. No.

13:18.631 --> 13:23.636
So, on behalf of the Umbrella Corporation,
welcome home.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.724
-Wow, so lame.
-Great, really great.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.769
New Raccoon City
used to be an old factory town.

13:31.852 --> 13:34.021
When Umbrella bought it,
it was almost deserted.

13:34.104 --> 13:38.901
But with a little inspiration
and a lot of hard work, well…

13:39.944 --> 13:41.821
it's just special here.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.865
The sun's a little brighter,
the air's a little cleaner.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.243
You can have a house
with all the latest bells and whistles.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.079
And plenty of room to run and play.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.623
Right.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.668
I mostly just read <i>Zootopia</i> porn, so…

13:58.921 --> 14:00.339
Oh, excuse me.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.093
He's super important.

14:04.802 --> 14:05.803
-Wesker.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.222
No, I… I've been trying to work.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.558
Well, Saturdays are usually
my cheat days, but…

14:10.641 --> 14:12.101
What the heck?

14:12.184 --> 14:13.978
We're celebrating, right, girls?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.981
Christ. Tijuana? What happened?

14:17.064 --> 14:18.649
Who wants a slice of ca…

14:23.737 --> 14:24.947
You can drop it.

14:26.615 --> 14:27.658
The bitch act.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.535
Not an act.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.287
Do you think I wanna be here?

14:31.370 --> 14:32.580
Don't you?

14:33.622 --> 14:35.624
I mean, you were fine with moving.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.380
Didn't have a choice.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.007
And what was I supposed to do?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.551
Yell and scream and break a plate?

14:46.260 --> 14:48.971
-I mean, it worked for me.
-No, it didn't.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.599
At least I tried. You…

14:52.933 --> 14:55.102
What happened to the chick
that stole that beer?

14:55.185 --> 14:57.187
That broke into bio and let the frogs go?

14:57.271 --> 15:00.274
-She almost got expelled.
-She got fucking boring.

15:02.359 --> 15:05.738
You know, sometimes,
it's not so bad to just… get along.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.698
With Carol?

15:09.575 --> 15:10.492
Just try.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.496
I mean,
at least the guys are hot.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.375
-Let's go say hi.
-Can't. I'm too "boring".

15:19.668 --> 15:23.088
-Billie, I'm sorry. Okay? Come on.
-No, it's fine. I need to unpack.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.638
Fine. Whatever.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.684
Hey.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.437
-Hi.
-I just moved in down the street.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.105
-I just wanted to say hi.
-Cool.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.732
-I'm Jade.
-Simon.

15:43.108 --> 15:44.735
Hi, nice to meet you.

17:10.821 --> 17:11.905
Jesus.

17:13.240 --> 17:16.910
-That's one big old bastard.
-Check the camp. The girl.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.125
There's
gotta be 40 zeros over there.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.335
They fried those fuckers.

17:25.419 --> 17:28.505
But it going off,
must have woke that fucker up.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.385
-How is she?
-Still breathing.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.888
Looks like internal bleeding, probably.

17:36.597 --> 17:37.931
Concussion, definitely.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.065
Fuck me.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.777
She's a survivor.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.585
How much does she hate me?

18:07.503 --> 18:09.588
No one hates you, Dad.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.466
The move, I know it's hard, but…

18:14.218 --> 18:16.053
I didn't really have a choice.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.139
Umbrella gets what Umbrella wants.

18:22.976 --> 18:24.103
I'm sorry.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.147
All done.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.692
How are you?

18:37.616 --> 18:40.369
-I don't have to pick it up.
-If you don't, you'll stress.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.671
Wesker.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.883
I don't want excuses. We have protocols.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.302
-You forgot my sample.
-Hold on.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.263
I wa…

18:59.847 --> 19:02.766
-You took that yourself?
-I can work a needle.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.103
Gonna be awesome at heroin.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.448
Dad's worried about you.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.285
Dad worries about everything.

19:22.744 --> 19:26.290
We have never been sick, ever.

19:27.207 --> 19:31.753
-But still, every two weeks, blood test.
-He's just…

19:33.589 --> 19:35.966
-It's for our own good.
-Is it?

19:37.217 --> 19:38.635
Or he's a vampire.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.887
He's totally a vampire.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.100
You should have come today.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.269
The boys were cute.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.397
-Dumb, but cute.
-Right.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.984
-Cool.
-I'm an asshole. Okay?

19:56.945 --> 19:57.863
I know.

20:05.412 --> 20:06.622
You worried about tomorrow?

20:07.748 --> 20:10.209
-New school.
-New everything.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.169
So? New us.

20:12.252 --> 20:17.132
I mean, these kids in this shitty town.
We're gonna own them.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.551
No, I don't… I just want to be invisible.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.638
-Why?
-Come on. You know.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.182
Is this because of the frog thing?

20:25.265 --> 20:27.643
No, and the… The other thing.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.479
One, you were ten.

20:30.562 --> 20:34.942
Two, Alex Ingles kicked a first grader.
So you broke his leg.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.027
-Fair trade.
-I had to go to counseling.

20:37.778 --> 20:40.489
You know, and everyone
thought I was psycho.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.573
Including me.

20:43.867 --> 20:49.248
I need to stop getting mad
and then doing stupid shit.

20:49.331 --> 20:50.290
Hey.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.502
Look at me.

20:55.879 --> 20:57.881
You are not stupid.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.759
You're Billie fucking Wesker.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.512
You are nice and cool.

21:03.595 --> 21:07.307
You've got a great ass,
a 1520 on the PSAT.

21:07.391 --> 21:11.019
And you've got the best sister.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.439
So remember that and say "fuck it"
to everything else, okay?

21:16.775 --> 21:18.193
-Come here.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.485
Yeah, plus one through ten.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.862
It's pretty good, though.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.198
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>Raccoon City High!</i>

22:05.282 --> 22:08.785
<i>The lunch special today</i>
<i>is whipped cream, medium meatballs.</i>

22:08.869 --> 22:13.123
<i>Sign up form for Mandatory Fall Festival</i>
<i>sponsored by Umbrella.</i>

22:18.086 --> 22:19.755
Hey, lads. Lads.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.173
Sorry.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.633
<i>Positivity is a bridge</i>
<i>between you and your dream.</i>

22:23.717 --> 22:25.052
<i>Have a great day!</i>

22:25.135 --> 22:26.845
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.075
I know, they're not welcome you.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.538
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.041
-I'm, I'm--
-Billie!

22:58.835 --> 22:59.753
Who's that?

22:59.836 --> 23:02.964
My sister. Twin sister.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.341
You're twins?

23:05.258 --> 23:09.763
I mean, same dad, but our moms,
we had different egg donors,

23:09.846 --> 23:11.681
but the surrogate delivered us
at the same time.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.975
So, technically, yeah.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.395
Go science.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.772
So, you're, like, a freak?

23:19.648 --> 23:21.066
No.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.444
What's with the shirt?

23:25.612 --> 23:27.572
-Oh, I'm vegan.
-That's stupid.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.325
I just don't eat animals.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.870
My dad took me hunting last fall.
It was awesome.

23:35.038 --> 23:37.249
Shot Bambi in the brain.

23:40.961 --> 23:45.841
You know, when the end of the world comes,
we eat the vegans first.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.593
Eat this.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.686
Get off me!

23:58.895 --> 24:00.897
-Just stop! Stop!

24:01.731 --> 24:03.775
Fight! Fight! Fight!

24:03.859 --> 24:06.278
-Hey, get off! Get off!
-Up! Come with me!

24:06.361 --> 24:09.156
-Get off! Scram!
-Out! Move! Back, everyone!

24:09.239 --> 24:10.824
-Don't make me throw something at you!
-Move back!

24:10.907 --> 24:12.367
Billie, are you okay?

24:12.451 --> 24:15.787
-Hey! Hey, I got you.

24:22.169 --> 24:27.090
<i>I was lethargic,</i>
<i>unhappy, and unmotivated.</i>

24:27.174 --> 24:29.885
<i>And then I found Joy.</i>

24:40.520 --> 24:44.983
<i>A new product from Umbrella,</i>
<i>where our business is life itself.</i>

24:46.735 --> 24:48.737
I kind of…

24:50.489 --> 24:51.907
I hate it.

24:54.117 --> 24:58.288
Joy helps people with serious issues,
chronic depression, OCD.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.789
That's why I developed it.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.041
But this…

25:01.124 --> 25:03.210
She lives in a great house,
she's got a family,

25:03.293 --> 25:05.378
-why is she taking pills?
<i>-We aren't doctors.</i>

25:05.462 --> 25:08.089
<i>It's not our job to ask that question.</i>

25:08.173 --> 25:10.759
<i>We're just giving people</i>
<i>the tools they need to be happy.</i>

25:10.842 --> 25:12.302
-We need to take a step back.
-<i>We can't.</i>

25:12.385 --> 25:14.846
-With what's happening in Tijuana--
<i>-We booked the ad buys.</i>

25:14.930 --> 25:16.890
<i>We launch in six weeks.</i>

25:17.933 --> 25:21.311
<i>Eli Lilly made three billion a year</i>
<i>off Prozac.</i>

25:21.394 --> 25:23.355
<i>We could double that in the first month.</i>

25:24.397 --> 25:25.524
Billie, stop!

25:26.650 --> 25:28.318
-Where the hell were you?

25:28.401 --> 25:29.486
Uh, here.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.363
Then why weren't you
picking up your phone?

25:31.446 --> 25:33.240
I was on a call.

25:34.282 --> 25:37.911
-Fuck you!
-Jade! Jade! Jade!

25:38.495 --> 25:40.830
-Billie!

25:41.706 --> 25:43.166
Billie, come on.

25:57.931 --> 25:59.349
<i>Get off! Get off!</i>

26:03.812 --> 26:06.648
Billie, let me in. Please.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.650
Jade, tell me what's going on.

26:15.865 --> 26:17.325
Go back to work.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.915
<i>Why</i>
<i>didn't you just sit with me?</i>

26:26.376 --> 26:27.836
You were with your friends.

26:29.754 --> 26:30.880
Owning them.

26:32.507 --> 26:34.843
-Hey.
-I didn't want to ruin it.

26:34.926 --> 26:35.885
Hey.

26:37.345 --> 26:40.348
I don't give a fuck about those assholes.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.226
The only person
I care about is you.

26:46.646 --> 26:47.981
You know what you have to do.

26:48.064 --> 26:49.691
-Apologize.
-What?

26:49.774 --> 26:53.236
-The fight, it was… It was my fault.
-No.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.654
You have to go at her.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.407
Why, so everyone can think
I'm psycho again?

26:58.783 --> 27:01.786
-I mean, they… they think--
-They're laughing at you.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.414
The entire school.

27:05.999 --> 27:09.002
And you need to shut them the fuck up.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.799
<i>Papal States</i>
<i>move to wall off Sicily.</i>

27:55.882 --> 27:58.760
<i>Last Alaskan Freehold goes dark.</i>

27:58.843 --> 28:01.554
<i>…and our patented bionanite technology</i>

28:01.638 --> 28:06.393
<i>stops 99.99 percent of known cancers</i>
<i>in their tracks.</i>

28:06.476 --> 28:10.647
<i>Available now from Umbrella,</i>
<i>where our business is life--</i>

28:10.730 --> 28:11.731
Map.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.742
-Where am I?
-Brighton.

28:23.326 --> 28:25.245
-You're in the Brighton Freehold.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.502
-I'm Tate, by the way.
-I need to get back to my camp.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.172
-I need my gear.
-Sure.

28:36.256 --> 28:39.134
We can make that happen… tomorrow.

28:42.929 --> 28:43.930
Now.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.355
Uh, slow down.

28:58.403 --> 29:00.697
-You're scavengers.
-Something like that.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.533
There's still a lot of old tech
around London.

29:03.616 --> 29:07.245
The richies in Auckland and Oslo,
they want it.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.126
We only take what we can trade.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.336
-How'd you get me here?
-Helicopter.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.630
-Where is it?
-Out. Another recce.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.798
So we can drive?

29:19.632 --> 29:22.051
No, we really can't.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.219
Like I said…

30:05.303 --> 30:06.596
really can't.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.522
One punch. Right in the tit.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.157
Hey.

30:29.577 --> 30:30.995
I'm sorry.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.623
I… I should have just let it go.

30:35.959 --> 30:36.960
Can we be cool?

30:54.435 --> 30:55.478
Wait.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.857
Fucking bitch!

31:00.024 --> 31:01.109
Billie.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.451
This is the last footage
out of Tijuana.

31:28.094 --> 31:31.973
<i>Why won't he die? Why?</i>

31:32.056 --> 31:33.850
Six injured, three dead.

31:38.980 --> 31:42.108
-Has anything gone public?
-Nothing we can't handle.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.321
Albert, if it's happening again…

32:33.284 --> 32:34.410
Billie.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.347
Is this your locker?

32:55.098 --> 32:56.349
Well, I don't…

32:56.432 --> 32:58.351
-What happened?
-Open it.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.238
-She's psycho, okay?
-Mr. Isaacs…

33:10.321 --> 33:11.906
-She jumped my kid.
-No, I didn't.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.326
And these days, everyone gets a trophy,
everyone's special, but…

33:15.410 --> 33:19.664
I don't know what your problem is here.
Maybe the voices made you or… whatever.

33:19.747 --> 33:21.582
It doesn't matter. We're pressing charges.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.377
You, you're gonna spend
the next ten years in a cell!

33:25.795 --> 33:27.922
Mr. Wesker,
thank you for coming.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.635
Sorry, I'm late. I got caught up. Work.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.846
Wesker. Shit.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.014
You okay?

33:36.848 --> 33:39.600
-Mr. Isaacs was just saying…
-I heard.

33:41.936 --> 33:44.272
-Thin walls.
-Uh…

33:44.355 --> 33:50.069
Now, I know that Billie has a history,
but we're all part of the Umbrella family.

33:50.153 --> 33:54.574
-I'm sure we can work this out.
-You… threatened my daughter.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.577
-No, I, I--
-What's your name?

33:58.953 --> 33:59.871
It's Dave.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.291
What do you do for Umbrella, Dave?

34:03.374 --> 34:05.668
-I'm a server admin.
-And, um…

34:06.753 --> 34:09.088
how many people can do your job, Dave?

34:09.172 --> 34:11.507
A thousand? Ten thousand?

34:12.091 --> 34:13.509
I guess?

34:13.593 --> 34:15.344
Well, I work for Umbrella, too.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.680
And do you know
how many people could do my job?

34:19.849 --> 34:22.101
One. Me.

34:25.438 --> 34:29.525
-Okay. Cool?
-It's not.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.613
It means I work too much. It means…

34:35.615 --> 34:38.326
I'm not much of a father. I try, but…

34:41.412 --> 34:42.330
I'm not.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.625
Okay, but what… What does this--

34:45.708 --> 34:49.837
And it means that Umbrella needs me. So…

34:51.422 --> 34:55.426
what happens if I call the people
that own this town?

34:55.510 --> 34:57.720
The people that pay you and me and her.

34:58.721 --> 35:02.892
What happens if I call them
and I say that I'm going to quit unless…

35:04.185 --> 35:05.812
they fired you.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.899
No, I'm sorry. I…

35:10.983 --> 35:12.652
I don't want you fired.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.363
I want you blacklisted.

35:16.155 --> 35:19.075
I want it so that no tech company
ever hires you.

35:19.158 --> 35:20.743
Not Apple. Not Google.

35:20.827 --> 35:23.496
I want PornHub to shred your resume.

35:24.372 --> 35:28.042
Now, if I say that…

35:29.627 --> 35:31.462
what do you think
they're going to do, Dave?

35:34.966 --> 35:35.925
Dave.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.262
I, uh… Hey, man…

35:40.346 --> 35:41.806
Look, man…

35:42.390 --> 35:43.391
I didn't mean to…

35:44.642 --> 35:47.603
I… I'm not gonna call the cops.
Okay? And, and, and you know…

35:48.479 --> 35:50.898
This… Never mind… This, this whole thing?

35:51.607 --> 35:53.192
-It… it never happened.
-What?

35:53.276 --> 35:56.154
Mr. Wesker, this girl was attacked.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.449
-By you?
-No.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.038
I believe her.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.958
-Then who did it?
-Oh, I don't care.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.753
-Dad, this is stu--
-Tammy, just shut up.

36:12.837 --> 36:13.880
But…

36:14.547 --> 36:17.675
you attacked my daughter twice.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.302
So…

36:19.844 --> 36:22.388
I think you owe her an apology.

36:24.265 --> 36:27.268
Just… just do it.

36:29.812 --> 36:30.730
I'm sorry.

36:32.106 --> 36:32.940
No.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.150
Again.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.401
Better.

36:39.113 --> 36:41.490
I'm really sorry.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.869
I'll… never do anything to you again.

36:46.037 --> 36:46.954
Ever.

36:49.624 --> 36:50.541
Thanks.

36:53.127 --> 36:57.173
I think Billie should take tomorrow off
and call it a mental health day.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.011
Of course.

37:03.679 --> 37:07.266
So, everyone happy?

37:07.892 --> 37:10.394
Yeah. Totally.

37:12.271 --> 37:14.232
And I was thinking maybe
you could come by the lab.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.150
-We could do lunch.
-Okay.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.110
I'll get the car.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.324
Hey, what happened?

37:25.993 --> 37:27.453
I know what you did.

37:35.753 --> 37:39.173
-Those zeros, how many are out there?
-It changes.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.133
A few hundred at least.

37:41.842 --> 37:45.179
We got over a thousand last summer.
Not sure why.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.722
They can smell you.

37:47.306 --> 37:48.724
Their eyes go first.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.602
After about two or three years,
the cornea is fried.

37:51.686 --> 37:52.937
Their hearing goes next,

37:53.020 --> 37:55.398
but their sense of smell
it keeps getting better.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.441
And in the summer, people stink.

37:57.525 --> 38:00.736
-Smart fucking dead folks, huh?
-They're not dead.

38:01.487 --> 38:04.949
The T-virus doesn't kill people,
it rewires their brains.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.325
Your groupies outside?

38:06.993 --> 38:08.995
They're zero strain. Carriers.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.789
All they want to do is eat
and spread the virus.

38:11.872 --> 38:16.294
And when the T goes cross-species,
it triggers rampant cell growth.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.463
It makes animals big and mean and--

38:19.547 --> 38:22.300
Really fucking big
and really fucking mean.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.137
-What were you doing out there?
-My job.

38:27.555 --> 38:31.017
I study zeros.
Watch how they change, evolve.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.143
Zeros don't change.

38:32.226 --> 38:35.187
They will… because the virus will.

38:35.271 --> 38:39.150
If we're lucky, it'll get weaker,
and the weaker it gets, the smarter,

38:39.233 --> 38:41.277
the more human the zeros will become.

38:41.360 --> 38:44.280
We need to understand it. Them.

38:44.363 --> 38:46.490
I get how to kill 'em. I'm good.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.284
No, you're not.

38:48.367 --> 38:51.787
There's, what, 300 million humans left
on this planet?

38:51.871 --> 38:53.914
But six billion of them.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.585
I don't think you can kill them all.

38:57.668 --> 38:59.712
So we have to learn how to live with them.

38:59.795 --> 39:01.047
Like we do…

39:01.130 --> 39:05.468
AIDS or Ebola or anything else
that's trying to wipe out the human race.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.430
And we made them, so…

39:12.933 --> 39:15.686
-I didn't make no fucking zero…

39:15.770 --> 39:18.689
-…and I didn't end the fucking world.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.319
And, uh, I guess you know about that.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.279
You're a survivor.

39:26.405 --> 39:27.573
First wave, right?

39:28.908 --> 39:29.742
Your ink.

39:29.825 --> 39:32.453
You were in New Raccoon
when the outbreak started.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.955
That must have been something.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.835
When the sick hit Glasgow,
my dad put me and my sister on a boat,

39:39.919 --> 39:44.006
spent ten years in the Fair Isles
while the world went to fuck.

39:44.090 --> 39:47.468
But you?
You were right in the thick of it.

39:54.350 --> 39:55.351
Sorry.

39:56.268 --> 39:57.269
Uh…

39:58.437 --> 40:00.231
It's not easy to talk about, I imagine.

40:02.900 --> 40:03.943
Tate!

40:05.194 --> 40:07.279
-They're 30 out.
-Who?

40:09.240 --> 40:12.493
-Umbrella.
-Umbrella's coming here? Why?

40:13.119 --> 40:15.913
They've got a bounty on survivors.

40:15.996 --> 40:19.875
Turns out,
you're their number one most wanted.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.248
<i>Please state your name.</i>

41:00.958 --> 41:02.168
<i>Billie Wesker.</i>

41:03.252 --> 41:04.670
<i>Hello, Billie.</i>

41:04.753 --> 41:07.590
<i>You have been granted</i>
<i>a three-hour visitor pass.</i>

41:31.155 --> 41:34.158
<i>Introducing Joy for kids!</i>

41:56.472 --> 41:57.681
<i>Hey, Billie.</i>

41:57.765 --> 41:59.642
So can you come take a seat here
for a moment?

42:00.309 --> 42:01.477
He won't be long.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.274
Carl.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.776
-Hey.
-Hi.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.444
Are you going to that thing this weekend?

42:10.528 --> 42:12.363
-Yeah, it should be fun.
-Great.

42:12.446 --> 42:14.490
And I'm assuming
you'll be there, obviously.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.326
What time are you thinking
of making an appearance?

42:17.409 --> 42:18.953
-Like, 7:00?
-Me too.

42:19.036 --> 42:22.081
-Actually, could you give me a ride?
-Sure could…

42:23.082 --> 42:25.626
-Thanks.
-I have your number, so I'll…

42:25.709 --> 42:28.921
-Oh, whatever.
-You know I will.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.654
-Hi.
-Hey.

42:53.737 --> 42:55.114
Cafeteria's this way.

43:10.504 --> 43:11.547
Billie.

43:14.758 --> 43:15.759
I'm sorry.

43:16.844 --> 43:20.347
At school, no one's laughing
at you anymore.

43:21.515 --> 43:23.976
And they don't think
you're a psycho either.

43:26.395 --> 43:27.396
They…

43:29.023 --> 43:30.107
They love you now.

43:31.233 --> 43:33.485
Just please don't hate me.

43:39.408 --> 43:40.576
I don't hate you.

43:42.536 --> 43:44.788
-But you owe me.
-Yes!

43:45.456 --> 43:47.583
Okay, anything. Anything.

43:57.092 --> 43:59.136
Did you know Umbrella does animal testing?

44:00.220 --> 44:01.221
No.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.851
Neither does anyone else.

44:07.102 --> 44:09.188
And they say they don't, but they do.

44:10.147 --> 44:11.899
PETA gave them an award.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.067
So?

44:15.319 --> 44:17.821
Today, at Dad's office,
I saw these rabbits.

44:17.905 --> 44:20.991
-And?
-And it's gross and wrong.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.286
And I told you this place was fucked.

44:25.287 --> 44:28.290
But… kind of not our problem.

44:31.794 --> 44:33.712
You said "anything".

44:35.714 --> 44:40.219
And you said, you wanted them not boring,
crazy, frog-stealing in my back.

44:40.302 --> 44:42.304
-So you wanna steal the rabbits.
-If we can.

44:43.138 --> 44:46.475
I just need to get pictures
and put them online,

44:46.558 --> 44:48.811
and let people see what's really going on.

44:48.894 --> 44:50.771
-You think Dad will be okay with that?
-I…

44:53.190 --> 44:54.274
I don't care.

44:56.235 --> 44:59.405
What happened to getting along?
No stupid shit?

45:02.241 --> 45:03.450
Fuck it.

45:05.661 --> 45:06.537
Fuck it!

45:07.705 --> 45:08.956
There are no guards

45:09.039 --> 45:13.168
'cause everything's automated,
but the main gate is voice-activated,

45:13.252 --> 45:15.462
-and then there's cameras.
-No problem.

45:16.171 --> 45:18.132
You know how to get past security cameras?

45:18.215 --> 45:20.592
No. But the internet does.

45:43.741 --> 45:45.617
The guy
was, like, almost crying.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.161
Our Dad did that?

45:47.244 --> 45:49.496
The guy who wears socks to the beach.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.540
Who talks about escape rooms for hours,

45:51.623 --> 45:54.585
and whose password
to everything is Spock21?

45:54.668 --> 45:55.711
He was scary.

46:06.054 --> 46:08.015
<i>Please state your name.</i>

46:09.683 --> 46:11.602
<i>Hello, this is Albert Wesker.</i>

46:13.437 --> 46:15.773
<i>Good evening, Dr. Wesker.</i>

46:15.856 --> 46:19.526
<i>Now commencing your one hour</i>
<i>after-hours pass.</i>

47:07.282 --> 47:10.828
You don't wanna do this.
You play with Umbrella, you lose.

47:10.911 --> 47:12.663
-Always.
-I'm not playing.

47:12.746 --> 47:14.206
I just happen to have something they need.

47:14.289 --> 47:15.958
-Is this about money?
-Money is worthless.

47:16.041 --> 47:18.126
Then what the fuck do you want?

47:18.710 --> 47:22.798
A life. I hand you over,
and I get a pass to Umbrella territory.

47:22.881 --> 47:24.800
They'll never let you in.

47:26.593 --> 47:28.136
You're damaged goods.

47:43.694 --> 47:44.820
Watch her.

48:38.582 --> 48:40.334
Mr. Tate.

48:40.417 --> 48:41.710
Mr. Baxter.

48:42.544 --> 48:44.004
Your girl's over there.

48:51.845 --> 48:52.721
Cool.

48:56.016 --> 48:58.018
-Go.

49:50.070 --> 49:50.988
Dude.

49:52.197 --> 49:53.615
Fucked up.

50:01.081 --> 50:05.168
If they're hiding this,
what else are they hiding?

50:19.099 --> 50:20.183
No signal.

50:22.936 --> 50:25.063
Oh, um, that computer,
is it online?

50:30.444 --> 50:31.445
Okay.

51:12.778 --> 51:13.695
Oh, my God.

51:40.597 --> 51:41.431
Billie.

51:42.808 --> 51:45.268
-Billie!
-No. I just need to get pictures.

51:45.352 --> 51:47.104
-Just… hurry

51:54.736 --> 51:56.696
-No.

51:57.656 --> 51:58.573
No.

52:01.451 --> 52:02.828
It's okay.

52:03.787 --> 52:04.621
Okay.

52:05.705 --> 52:06.623
Okay.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.937
-What the fuck?
-I don't know.

52:32.440 --> 52:34.151
-Come on.
-Let's go!

52:41.783 --> 52:44.077
-In here. Hurry.
-Go, go, go.

54:20.882 --> 54:23.677
Go! Go, go! Go, go!

54:24.761 --> 54:27.430
Wait. I can't find it!

54:33.728 --> 54:34.646
It's locked.

54:34.729 --> 54:38.024
Help! Come on. Come on.

54:39.901 --> 54:43.405
I just need to… Okay, okay.

54:43.488 --> 54:45.907
-<i>Hello, this is Albert Wesker.</i>
-Play it again.

54:45.991 --> 54:47.409
-Play it again.
-I'm playing it.

54:47.492 --> 54:48.994
-Come on. Play it again.
-Okay.

54:49.077 --> 54:51.288
-You got this.
-<i>Hello, this is Albert…</i>

54:59.629 --> 55:00.922
-Help!
-Oh, my God!

55:02.841 --> 55:04.718
-Wait, wait!

55:06.970 --> 55:08.096
I'm coming!

55:23.069 --> 55:23.903
Billie.

55:28.950 --> 55:30.660
Billie, come on.

55:31.369 --> 55:32.329
Billie.

55:34.914 --> 55:36.416
Billie.

55:37.208 --> 55:39.169
Billie, you need to wake up.

55:39.252 --> 55:41.254
Billie, you need to wake up now.

55:42.047 --> 55:43.590
You need to wake up.

55:44.466 --> 55:47.677
Please wake up. Please.

55:48.845 --> 55:49.763
Come on.

55:52.140 --> 55:53.641
Come on.

56:24.464 --> 56:26.049
Oh, hey, Jade.

56:29.552 --> 56:30.970
Your sister's been looking for you.

56:47.112 --> 56:49.197
Stay the fuck away from me.
