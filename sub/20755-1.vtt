WEBVTT

00:31.432 --> 00:35.002
Jochebed narrating:
Here we are...

00:35.035 --> 00:37.471
in the same place
you left us.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.312
If we reach out,
will you reach back?

00:49.250 --> 00:51.252
We want to trust you.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.265
( crickets chirping )

01:15.409 --> 01:17.878
Do you have
everything you need?

01:17.911 --> 01:20.314
Yes.
Thank you.

01:20.348 --> 01:23.184
I'll come back
with something to eat.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.295
If they find you here,

01:34.328 --> 01:36.330
I'll say
you came on your own.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.998
That I don't know you.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.275
Don't make me sorry
for helping you.

01:47.308 --> 01:49.177
I won't.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.189
Jochebed:
My son...

02:02.990 --> 02:05.826
Carry these words
for all of your days.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.132
The Creator
scattered beauty

02:12.166 --> 02:14.134
across the face
of the earth

02:14.168 --> 02:15.536
and throughout
the skies.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.874
He wove the stars
and the earth together
with the seas

02:20.908 --> 02:23.076
and gave us a home.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.596
( gasps )

02:55.509 --> 02:58.178
God made man
in his own image.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.381
And man lived free
in his heart.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.861
The whisper of creation
led him up to high places.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.697
And he saw the earth
spread out below.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.783
( yelling )

03:35.816 --> 03:39.253
( voice echoing )

03:39.287 --> 03:41.789
( yelling )

03:41.822 --> 03:44.258
( voice echoing )

03:44.292 --> 03:46.294
( laughing )

04:05.479 --> 04:07.448
( sound of water rushing )

04:32.840 --> 04:34.107
Jochebed:
In the depths of those waters

04:34.141 --> 04:35.809
he found something.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.747
A memory.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.014
A reminder.

04:43.150 --> 04:45.152
Always God was with him.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.561
It wasn't always
this way.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.733
We didn't always hide
in the darkness.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.806
Once,

05:05.839 --> 05:07.975
we stood in the light.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.081
But that was long ago.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.020
Eden is still
in our blood.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.828
And all of our lives we spend
trying to return home.

05:34.435 --> 05:37.605
But God has always
been trying to bring us
back to him.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.782
Jochebed:
Did all the earth fall silent
in the ears of Abraham,

06:21.815 --> 06:23.917
as it does
before a storm?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.893
You give us the blessing,
so that we may be a blessing

06:32.926 --> 06:35.128
to all the nations.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.808
This God is different
than others I've heard

06:47.841 --> 06:49.309
men speak of.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.815
He said he would lead us.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.349
We will follow.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.653
He said that through me,

06:59.687 --> 07:02.756
all the earth
will be blessed.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.926
He's giving us
a child, Sarah.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.799
He's giving us a new hope.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.367
He's giving us a new life.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.973
Jochebed:
You invite us
into your story.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.413
You place the cup
in our hands,

07:26.446 --> 07:29.517
to be spread over
all the earth.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.619
Just as you once did
to Jacob.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.127
( fire crackling )

07:52.506 --> 07:54.007
Joseph slept,

07:54.041 --> 07:57.444
and you sent him
dreams of greatness,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.212
that one day
he would rise

07:59.246 --> 08:01.815
to the places
you set aside for him.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.787
You cannot

08:06.820 --> 08:08.822
speak to us in such a way.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.861
Your brother's
won't stand for this.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.864
I won't stand for this.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.866
It was just a dream.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.868
That is all.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.904
A dream in which
you rise up,

08:23.937 --> 08:26.540
and the rest of us
bow down before you?

08:26.574 --> 08:29.543
And a second dream
of the same.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.414
Do you really think
you shall rule

08:34.447 --> 08:37.183
over the sons of Israel?

08:37.217 --> 08:38.852
It was just a dream.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.386
I can see in your eyes

08:40.419 --> 08:42.923
you think this is more
than a dream.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.958
You think this shall
come to pass.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.096
Look at me.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.200
Look at me.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.938
Know your place,
little brother.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.417
Jochebed:
Our lives become a reflection
of your heart.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.920
( no audio )

09:12.953 --> 09:14.955
Your danger.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.865
Noah's voice:
You are my strength.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.967
You are my song.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.102
You are my savior.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.906
Jochebed: And to Noah,
you gave the strangest
journey of all.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.575
That a flood would come.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.679
That life
would begin again.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.441
( crickets chirping )

10:11.144 --> 10:13.180
I heard something today.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.350
From God.

10:21.689 --> 10:25.225
He told me
he's going to destroy
the earth with a flood.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.162
And he wants me
to build an ark.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.633
You lead us to the edge
of all things...

10:33.667 --> 10:36.569
where darkness
and light collide.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.941
There,
you ask us to die.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.377
There, you promise,
that we will be reborn.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.106
He is beautiful.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.875
Thank you.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.646
Are you hungry?

12:14.301 --> 12:15.903
I've just received the news

12:15.936 --> 12:18.939
that they will
be here by dawn,

12:18.972 --> 12:21.308
or sooner,

12:21.341 --> 12:23.076
depending on how many boys
like yours they find

12:23.110 --> 12:24.912
along the way.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.116
I trust you've made
arrangements.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.921
What is your plan?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.292
You're just like
the other girls

12:39.326 --> 12:42.429
who come through
this place.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.898
Who lay their heads
on that pillow

12:44.932 --> 12:46.834
and hold their sons close,

12:46.867 --> 12:50.337
thinking that somehow
you will be spared.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.140
- We will.
- You won't.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.445
A moment comes
for each of you
when you realize

12:58.478 --> 13:02.282
that this life,
these people,

13:02.315 --> 13:05.085
this country
owes you nothing.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.255
And they will take
everything away
in an instant.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.258
So my suggestion
is that you go.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.360
Whatever you are
planning, go now.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.163
I'm not ready.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.404
I know this
is difficult to accept.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.678
I once had a son.

13:31.711 --> 13:33.947
And this...

13:33.981 --> 13:36.316
is all that's left of him.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.152
Dirt from the place

13:39.186 --> 13:42.189
where they laid him
on the ground

13:42.222 --> 13:45.258
and ran a blade
through his belly.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.199
Pick it up.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.203
Hold it with your hands.

14:00.607 --> 14:04.544
Do not be so foolish
to suffer as I have suffered

14:04.577 --> 14:06.813
when you still have
a chance to spare him.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.916
I am telling you to go.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.685
Not yet.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.423
Not yet.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.096
Are we guilty?

14:24.231 --> 14:26.433
Of what?

14:26.466 --> 14:28.101
I think of the darkness

14:28.135 --> 14:32.605
in the heart of a man
who would slay a child.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.042
You and I would never
do such a thing.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.044
No.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.412
But how many in Egypt
raise their voices

14:39.446 --> 14:42.549
against the murders
of our sons?

14:42.582 --> 14:46.219
And how many are silent?

14:46.253 --> 14:49.957
Are they not just as guilty
as those who hold the blade?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.461
We are not responsible

14:54.494 --> 14:58.098
for what others do,
or do not do.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.600
But I question
if the darkness
is in us all,

15:00.633 --> 15:01.668
just the same.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.440
Perhaps it is violence,

15:07.474 --> 15:09.709
or silence,

15:09.742 --> 15:12.645
but it is a darkness,
nonetheless.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.950
Don't wait too long.

15:16.984 --> 15:20.153
There's nothing left
for you to give him.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.622
I can give him our story.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.560
You don't have to tell me,

15:27.594 --> 15:30.863
but I'd like to know
where you plan to take him.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.802
God told me
to put him in the river.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.774
God told you this?

15:41.808 --> 15:45.078
And what else
did God tell you?

15:45.112 --> 15:47.180
That I should trust him.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.376
Jochebed:
God of light.

16:19.246 --> 16:21.848
We look out across
these horizons

16:21.881 --> 16:24.551
and realize
how far we have to go.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.891
So bring us to the ones
who will stand with us

16:31.924 --> 16:33.426
in the night.

16:35.895 --> 16:38.765
A flame to warm ourselves.

16:39.899 --> 16:42.369
( twigs breaking )

18:32.512 --> 18:33.880
I want to give you
something.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.631
What is it?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.435
I don't know.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.037
A memory.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.675
It's beautiful.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.086
Your sister
made that for you.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.391
You look like her.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.227
And your father, too.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.897
They love you
as I love you.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.701
Sometimes I wonder

19:28.735 --> 19:31.471
if I'd rather
you die in my arms

19:31.504 --> 19:34.507
than live in the arms
of someone else.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.012
I don't want to go on
without you.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.517
That is why I pray
for courage.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.891
Jochebed:
You bind our hearts together

19:51.924 --> 19:54.060
with a thread
that cannot be broken.

19:57.897 --> 20:01.334
But when we open
ourselves to love,

20:01.368 --> 20:03.636
we also open
ourselves to pain.

20:27.093 --> 20:29.529
Where am I?

20:29.562 --> 20:32.565
This is my father's land.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.567
His name?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.603
His name is Laban.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.605
If you wait here,
I'll take you to him.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.908
And what's your name?

20:41.941 --> 20:43.343
My name is Rachel.

21:04.364 --> 21:07.634
Laban:
Here is my other
daughter, Leah.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.339
I'm sorry?

21:12.372 --> 21:13.640
This is my oldest daughter,

21:14.974 --> 21:16.509
Leah.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.451
Jochebed:
When Jacob saw the light
in Rachel's eyes,

21:24.484 --> 21:26.719
he knew
that he would stay.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.657
And so he began to work.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.158
Good morning.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.962
Good morning.

21:35.995 --> 21:38.565
Jochebed: And Laban
began to lay his trap.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.980
My son.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.649
In the beginning
we're filled with hope.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.056
The fear and the doubt

22:04.090 --> 22:06.493
come after
the journey has begun.

22:38.558 --> 22:41.928
Our father, Noah,
welcomed the madness.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.085
He laid the foundation
of a ship

23:06.118 --> 23:07.987
in the face of mockers.

23:10.757 --> 23:14.193
And one season
faded into the next,

23:14.226 --> 23:16.262
but Noah kept going.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.769
So don't let us
turn back now.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.449
Let our direction hold true

23:36.483 --> 23:38.284
and our hope remain.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.755
Let us come to find
that this darkness

23:42.789 --> 23:45.525
is just your shadow
hovering over us.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.833
Mama.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.135
Mama.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.837
Mama.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.438
Mama.

23:59.472 --> 24:00.540
Mama.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.320
Stay with me, Mama.

24:14.353 --> 24:16.188
Stay with me, Mama.

24:30.503 --> 24:31.571
You're dreaming.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.344
( cooing )

24:52.825 --> 24:54.460
Jochebed:
Adam and Eve spent
their nights

24:54.493 --> 24:55.795
looking into the stars

24:55.828 --> 24:58.364
wondering, what else?

24:58.397 --> 25:01.601
What more lay
just out of their reach?

25:24.023 --> 25:26.258
I want to show you
something.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.064
( birds chirping )

25:45.578 --> 25:46.846
Jochebed:
You once told Abraham

25:46.879 --> 25:48.781
that he would be
a great nation,

25:48.815 --> 25:51.083
as numerous as the stars.

25:53.052 --> 25:56.122
But his skies remained clear
for many years.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.570
Not yet.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.444
Soon.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.682
Soon.

26:35.494 --> 26:38.230
Jochebed:
So don't be angry when
we take your plans

26:38.264 --> 26:40.432
and replace them
with our own.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.776
Jacob.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.214
We don't have much time.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.800
Father.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.969
Who is this?

27:17.003 --> 27:19.205
It is I, Esau.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.210
Bless me, Father.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.118
Father, what's wrong?

27:32.151 --> 27:33.786
Your brother.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.988
It is I, Esau.

27:39.692 --> 27:41.327
He came.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.232
Are you Esau?

27:47.900 --> 27:49.501
It is I.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.474
He deceived me.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.676
What are you saying?

28:01.948 --> 28:03.950
I gave him your blessing.

28:05.117 --> 28:08.520
May God bless you,

28:08.554 --> 28:11.023
and nations serve you.

28:13.225 --> 28:16.763
May you rule
over your family.

28:19.598 --> 28:23.035
May those that curse you

28:23.069 --> 28:24.871
be cursed,

28:26.205 --> 28:29.942
and those that bless you

28:29.976 --> 28:31.543
be blessed.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.791
No!

28:47.159 --> 28:49.461
Esau, wait.

28:57.770 --> 29:00.206
Jochebed:
Jacob seized the blessing
from his brother.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.208
And then he ran
from his family

29:02.241 --> 29:03.575
to the land of Laban.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.148
Jacob!

29:15.354 --> 29:19.658
Jochebed:
Your plans become less
important than our own.

29:19.691 --> 29:20.993
Brothers,
we do nothing

29:21.027 --> 29:23.095
and he will rule over
our families.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.332
Is that what you desire?

29:29.035 --> 29:31.938
Our inheritance
will not fall into his hands.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.941
Our brother,
the dreamer.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.813
His words must be
reconciled.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.016
If we do this,

29:44.050 --> 29:46.485
there can be no chance
he comes back.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.191
There's no profit
in killing him.

29:53.993 --> 29:56.462
What price can we fetch
for a man like him?

30:05.337 --> 30:08.040
Jochebed:
You gave Joseph dreams
of greatness,

30:08.074 --> 30:10.009
then made him nothing.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.152
You let his life drift away
as sand blown

30:20.186 --> 30:22.054
from the palm of your hand.

30:25.057 --> 30:28.660
He was sold into slavery
by his own family.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.787
( gasping )

31:07.366 --> 31:09.135
Slave.

31:11.770 --> 31:14.273
That is your name.

31:17.743 --> 31:20.246
You will do
as your masters say,

31:20.279 --> 31:22.048
or I will gut you
like a dog

31:22.081 --> 31:24.050
and feed you to the birds.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.424
Do you understand,
Slave?

31:35.962 --> 31:37.896
Yes.

31:49.408 --> 31:52.411
Do you know what
got you to this place?

31:56.082 --> 31:57.616
Three things.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.955
Your fates have left you.

32:04.290 --> 32:07.426
Your gods have left you.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.629
And last,

32:10.662 --> 32:14.133
your brothers have left you.

32:19.205 --> 32:22.274
Now what is your name?

32:28.981 --> 32:30.816
Slave.

32:37.389 --> 32:39.125
Good.

32:58.144 --> 33:00.312
How am I gonna do this?

33:02.314 --> 33:03.882
It's impossible.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.062
Oh, Lord.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.664
Oh, Lord.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.399
How am I gonna do this?

33:39.685 --> 33:40.952
( wind whistling )

33:53.399 --> 33:55.867
( wind increasing )

33:55.901 --> 33:57.903
( thunderclap )

34:12.884 --> 34:15.087
( panting )

34:19.824 --> 34:22.460
Jochebed:
We tell you that our sin
is an illusion.

34:24.630 --> 34:27.132
Our darkness is temporary.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.937
But you know the sound
of our lying.

34:33.572 --> 34:36.608
( sobbing )

34:52.524 --> 34:54.659
Be still.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.195
( echoing )

35:02.033 --> 35:03.769
Who are you?

35:05.537 --> 35:07.038
Give him to me.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.482
Give me back my son!

35:16.515 --> 35:20.352
( gasping )

35:32.531 --> 35:34.200
Father?

35:34.233 --> 35:36.034
Judah?

35:41.307 --> 35:43.309
Something's happened.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.081
This is all that's left.

35:51.517 --> 35:55.020
We can't find his body.

35:55.053 --> 35:57.088
- What?
- We've been searching
everywhere.

35:58.657 --> 36:01.193
A beast must have taken him.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.128
( crying )

36:03.161 --> 36:05.497
No. My son.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.166
I'm sorry.

36:10.569 --> 36:14.673
My son... Joseph.

36:24.416 --> 36:28.019
Jochebed:
Sometimes in this darkness
we forget where you stand.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.225
We clamor through the fog
and cannot find you.

36:44.102 --> 36:46.905
Do you find me beautiful?

36:50.442 --> 36:52.244
Yes.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.756
And yet you do not
look at me.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.100
Look at me now.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.170
Tell me I'm beautiful.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.644
You're beautiful.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.682
Do you desire me?

37:35.454 --> 37:37.289
I am my master's servant.

37:39.024 --> 37:42.594
Yes, but he's gone.

37:42.628 --> 37:45.364
And he won't be back
for many days.

37:51.603 --> 37:54.406
Slave.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.808
You will come to my bed.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.046
Slave!

38:08.454 --> 38:10.021
( water dripping )

38:10.055 --> 38:11.857
( flies buzzing )

38:27.138 --> 38:29.775
And you.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.210
What led you over here?

38:41.186 --> 38:43.054
I had a dream.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.157
( laughing )

38:46.191 --> 38:49.761
Dreams do not lead men
in prison.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.571
Jochebed:
There is pain
in the wilderness.

39:01.206 --> 39:03.542
Your face is hidden.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.202
It's not easy for me
to ask you this.

39:34.440 --> 39:37.208
But we need children.

39:37.242 --> 39:40.879
If God is gonna
use this family...

39:40.912 --> 39:43.582
we have to make
hard choices.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.190
Jochebed:
Sarah no longer believed

39:52.223 --> 39:54.860
God could place a child
in her womb,

39:54.893 --> 39:58.530
so she sent her servant
into Abraham's bed.

39:58.564 --> 40:00.966
We hunger for assurance.

40:00.999 --> 40:04.102
But you are a God
of the unknown.

40:23.455 --> 40:25.991
Is this the dance
of faith?

40:26.024 --> 40:28.159
Or is this rebellion?

40:32.363 --> 40:33.832
( wind whistling )

40:33.865 --> 40:36.267
( animals stirring )

41:02.460 --> 41:04.229
Noah's voice:
You are my strength.

41:05.363 --> 41:07.666
Your are my song.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.334
You are my savior.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.936
What do you want here?

41:47.673 --> 41:49.240
What do you mean?

41:49.274 --> 41:52.343
Most men
that come through here
stay a day or two,

41:52.377 --> 41:54.245
and move on.

41:58.216 --> 42:00.251
I don't really have
anywhere else to go.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.192
I've seen the way
you look at her.

42:07.225 --> 42:09.795
Rachel.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.932
And now you want
to marry her.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.236
I do.

42:18.269 --> 42:21.039
As soon as I saw you
I knew you'd ask.

42:23.108 --> 42:24.776
Here's what I can offer.

42:26.745 --> 42:29.114
Work for me for...

42:30.649 --> 42:33.752
seven years.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.754
And I'll give her to you.

42:50.769 --> 42:53.571
Jochebed:
This is our inheritance
from Adam.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.674
The remnant of Eve.

43:00.478 --> 43:02.781
You gave them
all of the garden to roam,

43:02.814 --> 43:04.683
with one exception.

43:09.287 --> 43:13.124
And their feet
grew tired of the path
you placed before them.

43:35.113 --> 43:37.515
For everything
we've been given.

43:43.321 --> 43:45.156
And everything we haven't.

44:00.571 --> 44:01.840
Mama.

44:07.713 --> 44:09.681
( men approaching )

44:09.715 --> 44:11.216
( gasps )

44:11.249 --> 44:12.684
( baby cooing )

45:23.654 --> 45:25.223
No, no, no!
( crying )

45:27.158 --> 45:29.627
I'm asking you for mercy.

45:31.496 --> 45:32.697
Please.

45:32.730 --> 45:35.266
I'm asking you for mercy.

46:03.929 --> 46:07.532
- ( cooing )
- Shh. Shh.

46:11.803 --> 46:14.105
Jochebed:
You held Noah
in that quiet place

46:14.139 --> 46:16.374
between life and death.

46:18.309 --> 46:21.679
He floated the waters
forty days and forty nights

46:23.681 --> 46:25.450
believing that you
had not forgotten

46:25.483 --> 46:27.853
the promises
you once made.

46:33.291 --> 46:36.694
Are you a God who punishes
our weakness?

46:38.663 --> 46:41.900
Do you repay deceit
with deceit?

46:45.070 --> 46:47.038
Woman:
Put out the light.

46:50.075 --> 46:51.342
Rachel?

46:53.311 --> 46:55.013
Woman:
Put out the light.

46:59.985 --> 47:03.554
Jochebed: Laban sent
his oldest daughter Leah
into Jacob's bed

47:03.588 --> 47:05.323
in the middle
of the night.

47:16.401 --> 47:19.604
The deceiver
had been deceived.

47:22.507 --> 47:26.611
And somewhere Rachel awoke
with a broken heart.

47:30.415 --> 47:32.517
Your ways are a mystery.

47:58.143 --> 48:00.578
In time,
Joseph became a man

48:00.611 --> 48:03.348
who was known
to interpret dreams.

48:03.381 --> 48:05.083
Word spread throughout
all of Egypt

48:05.116 --> 48:07.953
of the man who heard
the voice of God.

48:07.986 --> 48:10.755
His name even reached
the ears of Pharaoh.

48:37.848 --> 48:38.984
I am not the kind of man

48:39.017 --> 48:41.452
who likes to be confused.

48:45.656 --> 48:49.060
If I'm troubled
by a dream,

48:49.094 --> 48:50.261
someone should be there

48:50.295 --> 48:52.197
to explain its meaning.

48:54.699 --> 48:58.103
Last night the gods
sent me a dream.

48:58.136 --> 48:59.670
And this morning,

48:59.704 --> 49:02.507
no one could tell me
the meaning.

49:05.476 --> 49:07.512
I have been told

49:07.545 --> 49:09.880
you're a man
who hears the voice of God.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.961
I am.

49:31.002 --> 49:34.372
Egypt will see
seven years of abundance.

49:34.405 --> 49:37.942
That'll be followed
by seven years of famine.

49:37.975 --> 49:40.045
Terrible famine.

49:40.078 --> 49:42.880
- And what should I do?
- Please.

49:42.913 --> 49:45.183
I am just a simple prisoner.

49:45.216 --> 49:47.185
Speak openly.

49:50.255 --> 49:52.890
Take one fifth of everything
from the years of abundance

49:52.923 --> 49:55.493
and store it away
for the famine.

49:55.526 --> 49:56.694
Then find a wise leader

49:56.727 --> 50:00.131
and put him in charge
of distribution.

50:00.165 --> 50:02.733
It's the only way the people
will survive what's to come.

50:04.169 --> 50:05.936
I've already found him.

50:12.743 --> 50:14.345
Come with me.

50:24.389 --> 50:26.357
Jochebed:
You make kings into slaves

50:26.391 --> 50:29.827
and slaves into kings.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.829
Sometimes I imagine
you moving across

50:31.862 --> 50:34.232
the tops
of the mountains,

50:34.265 --> 50:37.402
carrying your cup
that spills over onto
the world.

50:39.637 --> 50:43.574
Let there be another way
so that we may be restored.

50:58.789 --> 51:00.125
That's good for today.

51:06.264 --> 51:08.733
Trader:
No more today.
Come back tomorrow.

51:08.766 --> 51:09.734
Traveler
Please.

51:09.767 --> 51:11.769
I have nowhere else to go.

51:11.802 --> 51:14.105
I said no more today.

51:14.139 --> 51:15.706
Come back tomorrow.

51:15.740 --> 51:17.475
My family is desperate.

51:17.508 --> 51:19.144
We have no food.

51:19.177 --> 51:20.911
Don't make me beg you.

51:20.945 --> 51:24.415
Did you not hear me, slave?

51:24.449 --> 51:26.751
No, I'm not leaving
without something.

51:26.784 --> 51:28.119
Enough!

51:36.261 --> 51:37.528
You.

51:40.765 --> 51:41.966
Where are you from?

51:43.634 --> 51:45.002
Canaan.

51:45.035 --> 51:48.005
We have no food there.

51:48.038 --> 51:49.974
And how many of you
have come to Egypt?

51:51.642 --> 51:53.544
Myself, and my nine brothers.

51:57.682 --> 51:59.484
How many brothers?

51:59.517 --> 52:00.618
Nine.

52:06.324 --> 52:08.859
- You are a spy.
- No! What?

52:08.893 --> 52:10.461
Seize him!
Take him away.

52:10.495 --> 52:12.597
Why?
What's my crime?

52:12.630 --> 52:15.500
What have we done?
Please, please have mercy.

52:15.533 --> 52:16.834
Have mercy!

53:15.860 --> 53:18.229
He still doesn't know
who you are.

53:46.591 --> 53:49.494
Jochebed:
Joseph held the lives of his
brothers in his hands.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.230
Vengeance stood before him.

53:58.803 --> 54:00.405
But he sent them back
to Canaan

54:00.438 --> 54:02.607
to bring Benjamin
to his table.

54:07.812 --> 54:10.948
How can a heart learn
to forgive the guilty?

54:15.252 --> 54:16.987
I've seen you before.

54:18.989 --> 54:20.124
In a dream.

54:21.492 --> 54:24.061
We stood in the middle
of the river

54:24.094 --> 54:26.597
and a peace came over me.

54:27.598 --> 54:30.435
It filled my heart.

54:32.703 --> 54:35.205
Like nothing I have
ever felt before.

54:37.342 --> 54:38.876
This peace,

54:40.978 --> 54:43.314
it came from God.

54:43.348 --> 54:46.451
And I knew...

54:46.484 --> 54:49.687
I had to help you get back
to the place you came from.

55:05.970 --> 55:08.873
Jochebed:
After they rebelled
against God,

55:08.906 --> 55:12.443
Adam and Eve were banished
from the garden.

55:12.477 --> 55:14.679
All of life
became a reminder

55:14.712 --> 55:17.382
that they could not come home
until a price was paid.

55:36.066 --> 55:37.935
It's enough.

56:01.091 --> 56:03.360
It's not enough.

56:05.195 --> 56:08.232
It's never going
to be enough.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.508
No!

56:56.246 --> 56:59.884
No, no, no.

56:59.917 --> 57:01.952
No! No! No!

57:06.757 --> 57:08.425
No!

57:12.530 --> 57:13.498
No!

57:14.965 --> 57:17.301
Jochebed:
Cain murdered his brother

57:17.334 --> 57:18.769
and death walked
into life

57:18.803 --> 57:20.838
and made himself
at home.

57:41.992 --> 57:43.528
Who will carry the burden

57:43.561 --> 57:46.531
of all we have wrought
on the earth?

57:48.566 --> 57:51.068
We ask to be reconciled.

57:52.637 --> 57:54.639
We want to come home.

58:08.819 --> 58:10.588
Soldier:
Where will you go
from here?

58:14.659 --> 58:17.595
God told me
to put him in the river.

58:22.166 --> 58:23.934
You will follow me.

58:25.035 --> 58:26.671
I will show you a way.

58:30.074 --> 58:31.842
Why are you helping me?

58:36.180 --> 58:39.049
Because this child...

58:41.051 --> 58:42.620
will change the world.

58:44.922 --> 58:46.724
Pack your things.

58:51.461 --> 58:53.598
We will leave
at first light.

01:01:12.737 --> 01:01:16.340
Jochebed:
I send my son with a story
of who you are.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:25.249
We stand between
these horizons,

01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:28.418
watching for the light
to show us which way to go.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.926
( sniffles )

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.895
There you say, "Wait."

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:50.540
There you say,
"Trust me."

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:07.291
Joseph brought
his brothers to Egypt,

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:10.394
and they sat at his table
without knowing his face.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.801
And how is you father?

01:02:18.903 --> 01:02:20.404
He's well.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.473
Tell me about him.

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:25.943
His name is Israel.

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:28.979
He is a man of God.

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:34.518
And you?

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:37.621
Are you a man of God?

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.459
I'm a man who's made
many mistakes.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:49.033
What is your
greatest mistake?

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:53.270
I don't think I could say.

01:02:59.043 --> 01:03:00.978
Joseph: You brought
your youngest brother.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.614
As you wished.

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:08.886
Good.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:12.022
Then we're all here.

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.772
This is all
that I could find.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.841
They leave before light.

01:03:45.255 --> 01:03:46.656
Let's go home.

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:55.699
Would you steal from the man

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:58.168
who showed you mercy?

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:00.938
Would you take from me
after all that I have done?

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.550
- No, no, no, no, please.
- Go tell your father that one
of his sons is a prisoner.

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.585
- That he is a slave.
- Don't take him.
Please?

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:17.387
- Judah: Have mercy.
- Joseph: Mercy?

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:20.690
You're asking me
to show you mercy?

01:04:20.724 --> 01:04:22.059
Please.

01:04:22.092 --> 01:04:24.561
Take me instead!

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:27.231
Take me!
Take me!

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.605
Look at me.

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:42.646
Look at me.

01:04:49.786 --> 01:04:51.855
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.257
Look at me.

01:04:57.661 --> 01:04:59.964
What you have for evil...

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.734
God meant for good.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:13.310
( sobbing )

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:58.455
Jochebed:
We cannot lose hope.

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:01.625
We cannot lose sight
of where we are going.

01:06:08.865 --> 01:06:11.835
We pray to finish
the journey you gave us.

01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:17.574
To trust you.

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:20.810
We'll get off this boat.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:27.851
Jochebed: In time,
everything will fall

01:06:27.884 --> 01:06:30.220
into the places
you have made.

01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:34.891
Jacob worked fourteen years
under Laban's watch

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:38.528
to take Rachel as his wife.

01:06:38.562 --> 01:06:41.565
To you, a moment.

01:06:41.598 --> 01:06:45.035
A single step towards
building us into your people.

01:06:57.781 --> 01:07:00.850
You put the dream
in our hearts.

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:04.020
Don't abandon
your promises.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.028
Sarah:
Abraham?

01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:15.299
Abraham!

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.035
- Yes?
- Yes!

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:27.444
- It's happened?
- Yes.

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:28.945
It's happened.

01:08:08.985 --> 01:08:12.156
Jochebed: Always you are
shaping our hearts.

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:15.559
Keeping watch
over our days.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:18.928
Weaving one life
into another.

01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:21.765
Giving us another chance.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.189
God told Abraham

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.691
to take his son
up on the mountain

01:08:47.724 --> 01:08:49.993
and make
a sacrifice of him.

01:08:51.161 --> 01:08:53.763
The son he loved.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.631
Isaac.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.440
Wait here, my son.

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:45.174
( twigs snapping )

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.582
Jochebed:
All of this time you've been
pointing us to a day

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:56.286
when creation
will be restored.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.188
When a price will be paid
on our behalf.

01:11:07.163 --> 01:11:09.165
Jacob?

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:15.772
My name is Israel.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:23.913
Jochebed:
Because in the light
of this fire,

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:25.915
we see ourselves
for the first time.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.851
( fire crackling )

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:50.874
( sound of water rushing )

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.335
You have saved us.

01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:23.072
And you will save us again.

01:12:40.757 --> 01:12:42.258
What you have done for me,

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.561
for Egypt,

01:12:44.594 --> 01:12:47.263
can never be repaid in full.

01:12:50.967 --> 01:12:53.737
I was a prisoner
staring death in the face.

01:12:55.238 --> 01:12:58.542
My wrists in chains
and my stomach empty.

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:02.446
And now,

01:13:02.479 --> 01:13:04.814
I have more than
I could ever need.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:09.118
I've been repaid.

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:12.522
Perhaps.

01:13:12.556 --> 01:13:15.592
But I'd like to give you
one more gift.

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:17.260
This place.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:22.566
For your family
and all of their descendants.

01:13:22.599 --> 01:13:24.434
I open Egypt to them

01:13:24.468 --> 01:13:26.470
as their home.

01:13:28.572 --> 01:13:29.839
There are many of us.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.776
Good.

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.410
Let them come.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.968
My son.

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:23.727
This is where we came from.

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:28.364
This is where we're going.

01:14:32.636 --> 01:14:35.739
( crying )

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:41.511
( crying )

01:14:48.251 --> 01:14:52.021
( sobbing )

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:10.306
Jochebed:
So let us build
an altar and sing.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:14.310
Let us tell stories
and admire the stars.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:17.013
Let us dream
of those we love

01:15:17.046 --> 01:15:19.649
and those we have lost.

01:15:19.683 --> 01:15:21.384
We will rise by light

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:25.088
and face the wilderness
once more.

01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:27.557
We find that the river
flows slowly

01:15:27.591 --> 01:15:29.659
for many years,

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:32.829
and one day
has left a canyon.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:36.165
The rock cannot withstand
the mysterious deep,

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:38.367
and gives itself away
until it is reborn

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:41.237
as something
beautiful and majestic.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.840
You are the river.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:48.544
and I, the stone,
have been trying to
withstand this flood.

01:15:48.578 --> 01:15:52.281
We die a thousand times
in this wilderness,

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:55.752
but you give us strength
to overcome.

01:15:55.785 --> 01:15:58.421
Here you are,

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:01.090
my creator.

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:03.927
Here you are,

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.129
my maker.

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:08.765
You are not only merciful,

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:11.134
you are mercy.

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:13.102
You are not only loving,

01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:15.138
you are love.

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:17.573
You are not only beautiful,

01:16:17.607 --> 01:16:19.542
you are beauty.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:22.311
Take us back
to the place
we started.

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:24.047
Near you.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.115
Pay our price.

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:27.583
Lead us to the garden.

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:31.154
Let us trust you again.

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:43.299
Mama.

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:46.736
Miriam.
My love.

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.204
Why are you crying?

01:17:01.384 --> 01:17:02.719
Where'd you get this?

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.321
Miriam,
where'd you get this?

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:06.823
Come with me.
I'll show you.

01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:55.171
( coos )

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:57.240
Do you trust me?

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:10.954
**

01:18:25.869 --> 01:18:28.704
Miriam:
Father,

01:18:28.738 --> 01:18:30.807
Who is like you?

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:34.677
You stretch out your hands

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:38.915
and lead us in love.

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:40.950
You guide us
to the holy mountain.

01:18:42.952 --> 01:18:44.954
You are my strength.

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:49.125
You are my song.

01:18:49.158 --> 01:18:50.426
You are my savior.

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:51.761
**
