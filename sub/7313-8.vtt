13:02.652 --> 13:05.130
NCIS has 24 hours to
release the bodies.

13:05.173 --> 13:08.869
I understand, Mr. Secretary.
We'll make it happen.

13:10.217 --> 13:13.956
Fact is, we've got ten bodies,
no crime to investigate

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
and families anxious
to bury their dead.

13:16.043 --> 13:18.695
Let's close this,
Gibbs, and move on.

13:24.391 --> 13:25.956
Hey, Abbs, what do you got?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.739
What do you got?
Okay, check, that's done.

13:27.782 --> 13:30.608
We need to fast forward, we need
to get to the good stuff.

13:30.652 --> 13:31.652
Good stuff?

13:31.695 --> 13:33.000
Yeah, like the answers
and details.

13:33.043 --> 13:35.826
Gibbs, I'm going on
no sleep and all Caf-POW!s.

13:35.869 --> 13:37.826
Abbs, take a rest
for a few minutes.

13:37.869 --> 13:39.565
I can't, Gibbs, 'cause
the families are waiting.

13:39.608 --> 13:41.608
Luckily I developed an equation
using outside stimuli

13:41.652 --> 13:43.565
and my own
accelerated metabolism

13:43.608 --> 13:45.478
to predict how long I can go

13:45.521 --> 13:48.391
without closing my eyes before
I turn into Zabby or Zombie Abby

13:48.434 --> 13:49.869
and, according to
my calculations,

13:49.913 --> 13:51.826
I have, like, five minutes
before I completely melt down.

13:51.869 --> 13:53.826
Well, then how big?Like Chernobyl big.

13:53.869 --> 13:55.347
Then go.
Don't wait for me.

13:55.391 --> 13:56.956
Okay, you asked me about First
Lieutenant Gabriela Flores,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.173
and I thought it was going
to be an easy answer.

13:59.217 --> 14:00.478
It isn't.

14:00.521 --> 14:03.434
This is the record
of Search and Recovery report.

14:03.478 --> 14:05.869
They have Flores listed
as a possible K.I.A.

14:05.913 --> 14:09.260
But that's pending positive
DNA identification out of Dover.

14:09.304 --> 14:10.782
Which is a delicate
way of saying...

14:10.826 --> 14:12.217
We don't know.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.565
Flores is believed to be
one of three Marines

14:14.608 --> 14:17.347
that were hit head-on by RPGs
at a school in Afghanistan.

14:17.391 --> 14:19.260
None of the bodies
were recovered intact,

14:19.304 --> 14:20.217
and what was recovered

14:20.260 --> 14:21.652
was burnt beyond recognition.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.695
Flores was tentatively
I.D.'d by her dog tags,

14:24.739 --> 14:27.826
which were found unattached,
but near the bomb site.

14:27.869 --> 14:29.347
That's why her Marine unit
in Afghanistan

14:29.391 --> 14:30.434
is still looking for her.

14:30.478 --> 14:31.695
Have to, until we
tell them otherwise.

14:31.739 --> 14:34.565
Yeah, but this is where
it gets really nuts.

14:34.608 --> 14:38.347
Seriously, Gibbs, I am like a
ticking time bomb right now.Just nutshell it.

14:38.391 --> 14:40.304
Kaboom. Plane crash.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.347
Six transfer cases were
loaded onto that plane.

14:43.391 --> 14:45.347
Only three contained remains

14:45.391 --> 14:47.565
from the attack that killed
Lieutenant Flores.

14:47.608 --> 14:49.086
And then,
after separating all those

14:49.130 --> 14:50.956
itty-bitty little fragments,

14:51.000 --> 14:53.652
we have a piece of our
puzzle missing, Gibbs.What?

14:53.695 --> 14:56.086
Gibbs, I only found
two DNA strands

14:56.130 --> 14:58.000
in the fragments sent
from the Flores' attack.

14:58.043 --> 15:01.478
There were only two Marines
in those three cases.

15:01.521 --> 15:03.043
And Flores wasn't
one of them.

15:03.086 --> 15:06.347
If Flores' dog tags were at
the school and her body wasn't,

15:06.391 --> 15:08.000
we have a humongous
problem.

15:08.043 --> 15:10.304
Where is Flores?

15:37.652 --> 15:39.608
Oh, come on, Tony,
a bucket list?
Hey!

15:41.043 --> 15:42.260
No snooping, McSteve Austin.

15:42.304 --> 15:44.217
My life is none
of your business--

15:44.260 --> 15:46.956
you and your little
bionic eyeballs.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.739
You're writing about buckets?

15:51.782 --> 15:54.260
It's a bucket
list, Ziva.

15:54.304 --> 15:56.260
It's a list of things
I'd like to accomplish

15:56.304 --> 15:57.826
before the end
of the fourth quarter.

15:57.869 --> 15:58.956
Life is short.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.869
I've got to start
making it count.

16:00.913 --> 16:02.826
[laughs]
"Discover the meaning of life"?

16:02.869 --> 16:05.434
Exactly."Ride a Ferris wheel naked"?

16:05.478 --> 16:06.956
Actually, I've
already done that.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.782
I should cross that off.
Do you have a pen?

16:10.434 --> 16:11.652
Thank you, boss.

16:13.173 --> 16:16.260
First Lieutenant
Gabriela Flores.

16:16.304 --> 16:18.608
Reported possible
"killed in action"

16:18.652 --> 16:21.043
just off base in the Helmand
Province of Afghanistan.

16:21.086 --> 16:22.521
Dog tags were at the scene,

16:22.565 --> 16:24.043

16:24.086 --> 16:25.695
Graduated

16:30.565 --> 16:32.739
from Marinesmagazine--
she wrote for them, as well.

16:32.782 --> 16:34.695
McGEE: It's a photograph
of her with

16:34.739 --> 16:35.739
the commandant of
the Marine Corps--

16:35.782 --> 16:36.739
GIBBS:
General Chuck Ellison.

16:36.782 --> 16:38.173
DAVID:
Lieutenant Flores was

16:38.217 --> 16:40.695
a public affairs officer
at Marine Barracks Washington.

16:40.739 --> 16:42.217
What was her assignment
overseas?

16:42.260 --> 16:43.869
Counterinsurgency.

16:43.913 --> 16:46.608
Flores volunteered for
the Female Engagement
Team last year.

16:46.652 --> 16:48.217
Quite a fetching FET.

16:48.260 --> 16:50.869
Culture forbids outside men from
interacting with Afghan women.

16:50.913 --> 16:54.304
FETs bridge the gap by attaching
to male infantry units.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.000
Put herself in the line of fire.

16:56.043 --> 16:57.956
McGEE:
C.O. says Flores
was blindsided

16:58.000 --> 17:00.565
in an attack on a girls' school
she was helping rebuild.

17:00.608 --> 17:02.043
Insurgent RPGs.

17:02.086 --> 17:03.913
This backwards belief that girls
should not be educated,

17:03.956 --> 17:05.434
I have seen
it consume people.

17:05.478 --> 17:07.956
I am sure the attack
on this school was just brutal.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.956
McGee, get me satellite footage
of the attack.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.043
On the phone to the DoD, boss.

17:13.086 --> 17:16.521
DiNozzo, Ziva, MTAC now.

17:16.565 --> 17:18.869
Let's go talk to Flores' C.O.

17:18.913 --> 17:21.913
Processing of the remains
was clean.

17:21.956 --> 17:24.000
Mortuary Affairs
gridded the area,

17:24.043 --> 17:26.043
documented site to flight.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.913
Everything we had,
we shipped back,

17:27.956 --> 17:29.043
along with her personal effects.

17:29.086 --> 17:31.130
Could it be that
none of Flores' remains

17:31.173 --> 17:33.608
made it through the RPG?

17:33.652 --> 17:34.913
Unlikely.

17:34.956 --> 17:36.260
Her tags survived,

17:36.304 --> 17:38.478
and those guys are trained
not to miss a thing.

17:38.521 --> 17:41.521
Last thing we want is to turn
a KIA into an MIA.

17:41.565 --> 17:43.000
Details.

17:43.043 --> 17:44.695
Nighttime ambush.

17:44.739 --> 17:46.000
Never saw it coming.

17:46.043 --> 17:47.260
There was nothing questionable

17:47.304 --> 17:48.782
about Lieutenant Flores'
actions.

17:48.826 --> 17:51.043
Just did what she was
trained to do, maybe better.

17:51.086 --> 17:53.956
You're sure she was in the area
when the RPGs were fired?

17:54.000 --> 17:57.086
I saw her myself on the comm.

17:57.130 --> 17:59.478
I knew they were taking
heavy fire at the school,

17:59.521 --> 18:01.608
so I ordered her
to evac back to base.

18:01.652 --> 18:02.956
Five minutes later,
we lost contact.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.043
She never made it.

18:05.086 --> 18:07.826
You ordered her back because
women are barred from combat?

18:07.869 --> 18:09.782
I have three FET Marines
attached to my unit.

18:09.826 --> 18:13.260
And technically, women are
excluded from direct combat.

18:13.304 --> 18:15.347
But out here,
the lines can get blurry.

18:15.391 --> 18:17.000
Any of your men have a problem

18:17.043 --> 18:18.347
with Flores being
outside the wire?

18:18.391 --> 18:19.347
The opposite.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.434
They called her Public Affairs.

18:21.478 --> 18:24.000
But the idea of her just sitting
behind a desk was laughable.

18:24.043 --> 18:25.739
She held her own.

18:25.782 --> 18:27.043
And leading up to the incident,

18:27.086 --> 18:29.043
she displayed
no unusual behavior?

18:29.086 --> 18:30.565
No, ma'am.

18:30.608 --> 18:33.391
Flores lived for the Corps.

18:33.434 --> 18:37.956
She was so proud, so dedicated.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
I used to say
I wish I had 20 of her.

18:41.043 --> 18:43.043
Now I wish I still had one.

18:43.086 --> 18:45.043
Until you guarantee she's not,

18:45.086 --> 18:47.043

19:22.043 --> 19:24.913
A few days ago, we had a group
of young girls show up.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.478
Found out through an interpreter
that their families had been

19:27.521 --> 19:28.695
killed by insurgents,

19:28.739 --> 19:31.869
and, well, they started
sleeping here.

19:31.913 --> 19:33.434
So our little project has become

19:33.478 --> 19:35.304
a de facto boarding school

22:52.608 --> 22:53.913
Yes, sir.

22:56.608 --> 22:58.130
BURKE:
Got this for you.

23:00.086 --> 23:02.043
Nice.

23:03.782 --> 23:04.913
Black.

23:04.956 --> 23:06.347
How'd you know that?

23:06.391 --> 23:09.608
Well, my old man used
to say that a Marine

23:09.652 --> 23:11.913
fixes his coffee to
fit his personality.

23:11.956 --> 23:13.000
Yeah?

23:13.043 --> 23:14.913
What's that say about me?

23:14.956 --> 23:18.565
Oh... bold, complex.

23:18.608 --> 23:21.260
Strong enough to stop
a freight train.

23:21.304 --> 23:24.000
Sounds like I'd like
your old man.

23:25.434 --> 23:26.826
Yeah, well, he,
uh... he spent

23:26.869 --> 23:28.956
most of his life
living in the V.A.,

23:29.000 --> 23:30.956
but he had
his moments.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.521
So I went to see Joseph Flores.

23:36.739 --> 23:39.260
I wish we had
some answers for him.

23:39.304 --> 23:41.347
Guy's been through enough.

23:41.391 --> 23:43.565
I get men
like Joseph.

23:43.608 --> 23:45.260
Fathers who want
to protect their daughters

23:45.304 --> 23:47.130
from all the evil in the world.

23:47.173 --> 23:49.043
Want to keep them safe.

23:49.086 --> 23:51.086
Can't.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.913
Well, little girls
grow into women who end up

23:55.956 --> 23:58.000
being just as stubborn
as their fathers.

23:58.043 --> 24:01.391
I didn't know Flores,
but I will bet you

24:01.434 --> 24:04.782
that there was a
lot of him in her.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.478
Personal check
from Justin Fanniker?

24:10.521 --> 24:12.130
Friend of
Gabriela's.

24:12.173 --> 24:15.739
She sent it from Afghanistan
one week before the attack,

24:15.782 --> 24:19.000
but Mr. Flores didn't feel right
about cashing it.

24:19.043 --> 24:21.043
He held onto it
because, look--

24:21.086 --> 24:23.608
look what... look what she wrote
in the memo.

24:23.652 --> 24:25.608
"Love you, Dad."

24:27.086 --> 24:28.260
He gave this to you?

24:28.304 --> 24:29.913
He signed it over
to the chapel

24:29.956 --> 24:31.000
in Gabriela's honor.

24:31.043 --> 24:33.434
He said that Justin,
her friend,

24:33.478 --> 24:36.000
would appreciate the gesture.

24:39.608 --> 24:42.000
Who is this guy?

24:42.043 --> 24:43.739
ZIVA:
Justin Fanniker, 27,

24:43.782 --> 24:45.173
is an American contractor
working in Afghanistan.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.347
Fanniker?

24:46.391 --> 24:47.913
As in Fanniker Construction?

24:47.956 --> 24:50.956
Daddy put up
half the drywall in D.C.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.043
for the last ten years.

24:52.086 --> 24:53.434
And not
just Washington.

24:53.478 --> 24:55.086
Fanniker Construction
did not hesitate

24:55.130 --> 24:56.913
to profit from the war as well.

24:56.956 --> 24:58.478
TONY:
Bid on a job
in Afghanistan,

24:58.521 --> 25:00.000
bank three times as much

25:00.043 --> 25:01.913
'cause of the hazardous
working conditions.

25:01.956 --> 25:03.869
I'd say Daddy
sent junior to cash in.

25:03.913 --> 25:05.391
GIBBS:
McGee, e-mails.

25:05.434 --> 25:07.782
Lieutenant Flores
had a few personal accounts,

25:07.826 --> 25:08.956
one of them very
well hidden.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.565
Tracked it through
Fanniker's.

25:10.608 --> 25:12.000
Dozens of
messages there.

25:12.043 --> 25:13.260
"I dreamt I was back home

25:13.304 --> 25:15.043
showing you the sky
as I remember it."

25:15.086 --> 25:17.217
Pretty syrupy.
She fell for that?

25:17.260 --> 25:19.956
Sincerity works sometimes,
Agent DiNozzo.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.086
You should try it.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.913
McGEE:
They met at Kandahar
Airfield three months ago.

25:24.956 --> 25:27.130
Day before the attack,
he tells her he loves her,

25:27.173 --> 25:28.565
but he's worried for her safety.

25:28.608 --> 25:30.304
Offers to give her father
whatever he needs

25:30.347 --> 25:32.304
if she leaves Afghanistan
with him.

25:32.347 --> 25:33.304
What did she say?

25:33.347 --> 25:34.434
Never responded.

25:34.478 --> 25:35.695
You think she went?

25:35.739 --> 25:36.782
Find Fanniker.

25:36.826 --> 25:38.000
TONY:
Maybe she agreed.

25:38.043 --> 25:39.956
They could be anywhere by now.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.347
Not anywhere.

25:42.391 --> 25:44.043
Flight record says
Fanniker Construction

25:44.086 --> 25:45.956
leased a plane
from Kandahar to Virginia

25:46.000 --> 25:47.434
day after the attack.

25:47.478 --> 25:49.173
Anybody on that plane
besides Fanniker and the crew?

25:49.217 --> 25:51.391
I can't access
the travel data yet.

25:51.434 --> 25:53.173
But I've been trying
to track his cell,

25:53.217 --> 25:55.000
and he just
placed a call.

25:55.043 --> 25:56.130
Give me location.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.782
McGEE:
Middle of nowhere.

25:58.826 --> 26:00.913
George Washington
National Forest

26:00.956 --> 26:03.043
near Roanoke,
Virginia.

26:03.086 --> 26:04.086
Send me coordinates.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.000
BURKE:
I hike there
in the summer.

26:06.043 --> 26:07.565
Uh, you mind if I come along?

26:07.608 --> 26:08.956
Yes.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.695
[chuckles]
I can be helpful, Gibbs.

26:10.739 --> 26:12.304
I can try to talk to him

26:12.347 --> 26:13.652
when mumbled
words emanating

26:13.695 --> 26:15.826
from a gray-haired
grizzly bear

26:15.869 --> 26:17.478
seem much less
persuasive.

26:17.521 --> 26:18.956
It's going to take us
a while to get there.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.130
You know,
we can chitchat.

26:20.173 --> 26:21.608
About what?

26:21.652 --> 26:24.130
Oh, you know, about things.

26:24.173 --> 26:26.304
I can tell you
why I embraced the clergy

26:26.347 --> 26:28.130
and became a chaplain.

26:28.173 --> 26:30.304
I kind of like
the quiet.

26:32.478 --> 26:34.869
So... two tours in
Afghanistan later,

26:34.913 --> 26:37.043
and I was even
more convinced

26:37.086 --> 26:40.608
that I was doing what God
had intended for me--

26:40.652 --> 26:42.130
helping others
find inner peace.

26:42.173 --> 26:43.913
Oh, peace sounds good.

26:43.956 --> 26:45.304
Little quiet, too, maybe.

26:45.347 --> 26:46.695
Oh, you're
being sarcastic.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.260
Oh, no, I'm not.
I'm being honest.

26:48.304 --> 26:49.565
I talked too much?

26:49.608 --> 26:52.434
I didn't say I
minded, padre.

26:58.173 --> 27:00.000
Justin?

27:00.043 --> 27:01.173
Who are you?

27:01.217 --> 27:03.347
NCIS.

27:03.391 --> 27:05.565
Just here to talk.

27:05.608 --> 27:07.391
Is she inside, Justin?

27:07.434 --> 27:09.043
Is Gabriela
with you?

27:09.086 --> 27:10.608
What?

27:10.652 --> 27:12.043
Her father's looking
for her, too.

27:12.086 --> 27:13.478
Put down the rifle.

27:24.869 --> 27:27.043
Gabriela's dead.

27:27.086 --> 27:29.000
Don't you know that?

27:29.043 --> 27:31.043
No.

27:31.086 --> 27:32.869
I went there.

27:32.913 --> 27:36.043
I saw what was left
of the school.

27:36.086 --> 27:38.913
Marines wouldn't tell me
anything.

27:38.956 --> 27:42.217
There was a girl,
one of her students,

27:42.260 --> 27:45.000
just standing there crying.

27:45.043 --> 27:46.869
I couldn't understand
everything,

27:46.913 --> 27:48.043
but I got enough.

27:48.086 --> 27:50.086
I saw more
than enough.

27:50.130 --> 27:52.043
You asked her
to leave with you?

27:52.086 --> 27:54.217
She said no.

27:56.086 --> 27:59.000
She would never
abandon her unit.

27:59.043 --> 28:01.826
Where she was, I knew something
like this would happen,

28:01.869 --> 28:03.913
but she wouldn't go.

28:03.956 --> 28:05.913
Justin, you
leave three

28:05.956 --> 28:07.739
open projects in Afghanistan

28:07.782 --> 28:10.043
and you rush out
to a place like this,

28:10.086 --> 28:12.043
you know, it looks like
you're running from something.

28:16.217 --> 28:18.347
I'm just trying
to keep it together.

28:20.217 --> 28:23.739
I met Gabriela,
and my whole life changed.

28:23.782 --> 28:26.173
I loved her, and now she's gone.

28:41.043 --> 28:44.043
You still here, McGee?

28:44.086 --> 28:44.956
What are we
looking at?

28:45.000 --> 28:46.043
Satellite footage.

28:46.086 --> 28:48.086
Just released
by the Joint Staff.

28:48.130 --> 28:49.695
Flores?

28:49.739 --> 28:51.739
The structure in the middle
is the school,

28:51.782 --> 28:55.043
and based on witness accounts,
Lieutenant Flores could be

28:55.086 --> 28:56.478
in any one of these clusters.

28:56.521 --> 28:58.086
There's RPG one.

28:58.130 --> 29:01.086
How long until
the second RPG hit?

29:01.130 --> 29:03.913
RPG two made contact
a few minutes later.

29:03.956 --> 29:05.043
Can you sharpen this?

29:06.695 --> 29:09.304
Boss, this is...
it's like a low-res feed

29:09.347 --> 29:11.608
from a satellite output
that came to me via e-mail.

29:11.652 --> 29:14.043
I can try to get my hands on
a cleaner copy in the morning,

29:14.086 --> 29:16.043
but that's if they'll
give me access.

29:16.086 --> 29:19.043
Tell them the commandant of
the Marine Corps needs access.

29:19.086 --> 29:21.086
And if that doesn't work?It'll work.

29:21.130 --> 29:22.913
ZIVA:
Gibbs, we spoke
to the lieutenant's C.O.,

29:22.956 --> 29:24.043
Captain Quincy.
He and his men

29:24.086 --> 29:26.086
have been searching
round the clock.

29:26.130 --> 29:28.913
Coming up empty-handed, boss,
but not for lack of trying.

29:28.956 --> 29:30.260
No remains,
nothing to go on

29:30.304 --> 29:32.565
but a set of dog tags
and some ripped clothing.

29:32.608 --> 29:34.478
There has to be
something here.

29:34.521 --> 29:36.782
Just got to look harder.

29:36.826 --> 29:39.173
Tomorrow. Go home.

29:39.217 --> 29:41.043
Get some sleep.

29:41.086 --> 29:42.304
What about you?

29:42.347 --> 29:44.043
You going to stay here
and work all night?

29:44.086 --> 29:45.652
'Cause if you stay,
we stay.

29:45.695 --> 29:47.043
Let's not get
carried away, Ziva.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.000
You heard the man.

29:51.695 --> 29:53.956
Special Agent David,
you did not just do that.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.086
I did, and I would
do it again.

29:56.130 --> 29:58.043
Oh, no, you will not.

29:58.086 --> 29:59.391
Ah, stand down, DiNozzo.

29:59.434 --> 30:01.956
I appreciate the offer.

30:04.086 --> 30:05.000
We can all
use the rest...

30:06.521 --> 30:07.478
...distance.

30:07.521 --> 30:09.478
Might help us think.

30:09.521 --> 30:11.086
Tired, boss?
Need a ride?

30:11.130 --> 30:12.695
No.

30:12.739 --> 30:14.478
Need to do one more thing.

30:39.521 --> 30:42.043
[door opening]

30:42.086 --> 30:43.782
Jethro.

30:43.826 --> 30:45.304
Hi, Duck.
Thought you went home.

30:45.347 --> 30:47.260
Making final arrangements

30:47.304 --> 30:49.739
for the departure
of our guests tomorrow.

30:49.782 --> 30:51.695
They need to be
with their families.

30:51.739 --> 30:53.304
It's a primal desire

30:53.347 --> 30:56.565
that affects the living
more so than the dead.

30:56.608 --> 30:58.913
I hear there's
still one Marine

30:58.956 --> 31:01.217
to be accounted for.

31:01.260 --> 31:04.478
First Lieutenant
Gabriela Flores.

31:04.521 --> 31:06.043
Oh.

31:06.086 --> 31:08.826
Well, I doubt
that my friends here

31:08.869 --> 31:11.782
can tell you details
of her whereabouts,

31:11.826 --> 31:13.695
but feel free to ask.

31:16.086 --> 31:18.086
I don't know what to ask.

31:18.130 --> 31:19.608
Then it may be

31:19.652 --> 31:22.478
that you are talking
to the wrong people.

31:22.521 --> 31:26.913
Jethro, the dead
have always been kind to me.

31:26.956 --> 31:30.130
Provided answers
I have required.

31:30.173 --> 31:32.043
But if there
is a possibility

31:32.086 --> 31:34.260
that First Lieutenant Flores
is still alive,

31:34.304 --> 31:36.391
then perhaps these

31:36.434 --> 31:39.869
are not the ones
to whom you should turn.

31:48.869 --> 31:50.000
This is Chaplain Burke.

31:50.043 --> 31:51.608
Hey, Burke.

31:51.652 --> 31:54.521
Marines who understand
these schools--

31:54.565 --> 31:56.652
do you know any?

32:00.913 --> 32:02.391
WOMAN: I left teaching
to join the Marines.

32:02.434 --> 32:04.521
Left the Marines
to go back to teaching.

32:04.565 --> 32:07.478
Emily was in the first
FET to go to Afghanistan.

32:07.521 --> 32:09.043
You knew Flores?

32:09.086 --> 32:10.478
Can't say
that I did.

32:10.521 --> 32:12.217
Can say I probably understand
some of what

32:12.260 --> 32:13.652
she was going through
over there.

32:13.695 --> 32:15.043
[children laughing]

32:15.086 --> 32:16.782
[chuckles]

32:16.826 --> 32:18.782
Seeing them laugh
like that--

32:18.826 --> 32:20.173
part of me feels so happy,

32:20.217 --> 32:21.956
but it makes me think
of the kids I left behind.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.173
Wasn't like this
for them.

32:24.217 --> 32:25.826
Especially the girls.

32:26.869 --> 32:28.391
Tell him about the notes.

32:28.434 --> 32:30.652
We tried to set
up some sort

32:30.695 --> 32:32.478
of informal
education for girls.

32:32.521 --> 32:34.478
Our two potential teachers
dropped out,

32:34.521 --> 32:36.000
thanks to "night letters."

32:36.043 --> 32:36.956
Death threats?
Mm.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.521
That wasn't
the worst of it.

32:38.565 --> 32:41.521
A little girl was carrying
a workbook we gave her.

32:41.565 --> 32:44.043
Insurgents threw acid
in her face.

32:44.086 --> 32:46.260
Everybody thinks
of insurgents

32:46.304 --> 32:48.260
as disorganized bands
in the wilderness.

32:48.304 --> 32:50.043
They are fully capable
of advanced strategy

32:50.086 --> 32:51.695
when they have a clear target.

32:51.739 --> 32:54.826
That's what a girls'
school is to them.

32:54.869 --> 32:56.304
It's a clear target.

33:04.304 --> 33:05.826
Abbs, play this.

33:05.869 --> 33:07.260
What is it?

33:07.304 --> 33:08.913
It's a picture of what was
going on around Flores.

33:08.956 --> 33:10.739
It's an audio recording, boss.

33:10.782 --> 33:12.043
There is no picture.

33:12.086 --> 33:13.086
Uh-huh.

33:13.130 --> 33:14.913
FLORES [on tape]:
Gabriela Flores.

33:14.956 --> 33:16.913
Freelance article info,
continued.

33:16.956 --> 33:18.304
Now go forward.

33:18.347 --> 33:21.260
[recording fast-forwards]

33:21.304 --> 33:22.434
There.

33:22.478 --> 33:23.913
FLORES:
So our little project has become

33:23.956 --> 33:25.739
a de facto boarding school
for girls.

33:25.782 --> 33:27.608
If you can hear that...[men speaking Pashtu]

33:27.652 --> 33:29.000
There. Isolate
the background.

33:29.043 --> 33:31.260
...it's some of the locals
helping us build

33:31.304 --> 33:32.434
an addition to the school.

33:32.478 --> 33:33.826
What is that-- Farsi?

33:33.869 --> 33:35.260
It's Pashtu.

33:35.304 --> 33:37.043
TONY:
Number nine
on the David language list.

33:37.086 --> 33:39.000
Our very own Beauty
of Berlitz.

33:39.043 --> 33:41.391
I think of Pashtu more
as number seven, actually.

33:41.434 --> 33:44.565
Anything?Can you go back?

33:44.608 --> 33:46.608
[recording rewinding]

33:47.782 --> 33:49.173
Can you enhance this?

33:49.217 --> 33:52.304
[amplified speech in Pashtu]

33:52.347 --> 33:54.478
Talk to us.

33:54.521 --> 33:56.478
He said "next time,
they'll think twice

33:56.521 --> 33:58.043
about building a school."

33:58.086 --> 33:59.739
[man continues in Pashtu
on recording]

33:59.782 --> 34:02.521
"The plan has no weakness."

34:04.043 --> 34:07.000
They are discussing
the destruction of the school.

34:07.043 --> 34:10.043
So, it was the people
she was working with?

34:10.086 --> 34:11.608
They're hiding in plain sight.

34:11.652 --> 34:13.347
Flores knew them,
and they knew her.

34:13.391 --> 34:16.130
She had no idea
who she was dealing with.

34:23.086 --> 34:25.652
Insurgents were on
the inside, Captain.

34:25.695 --> 34:27.043
In the school.

34:27.086 --> 34:28.043
Not surprised.

34:28.086 --> 34:30.043
Well, we were.

34:30.086 --> 34:32.217
Were you planning
to tell anybody?

34:32.260 --> 34:35.434
Locals play both sides
to survive, Agent Gibbs.

34:35.478 --> 34:37.043
Always have.

34:37.086 --> 34:38.652
Just comes with the territory.

34:38.695 --> 34:39.869
Dangerous.

34:39.913 --> 34:41.869
Usually more for them than us.

34:41.913 --> 34:43.652
This is a well-timed strike.

34:43.695 --> 34:44.956
Planned perfectly.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.304
The school, they kept records?

34:47.347 --> 34:48.739
Minimal.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.782
There are two teachers--
one male, one female.

34:50.826 --> 34:52.782
And a group of laborers
made a habit

34:52.826 --> 34:55.000
of wandering in and out
of the area.

34:55.043 --> 34:56.000
What's the status?

34:56.043 --> 34:57.565
Unknown.

34:57.608 --> 35:00.043
Haven't been able to locate
anyone since the attack.

35:00.086 --> 35:02.043
None of the locals
feel like talking.

35:02.086 --> 35:04.043
Yeah. That sounds about right.

35:04.086 --> 35:06.956
Agent Gibbs, tell me what
you need, and I'll do it.

35:07.000 --> 35:10.304
But if your people,
Dover and A.I.U. are all saying

35:10.347 --> 35:13.043
Lieutenant Flores's DNA
wasn't in those remains,

35:13.086 --> 35:15.043
then pardon my French,
but where in the hell is she?

35:15.086 --> 35:16.913
Keep looking, Captain.

35:16.956 --> 35:18.043
We'll find something.

35:18.086 --> 35:19.391
We have to.

35:19.434 --> 35:21.913
I understand next of kin
has been contacted.

35:21.956 --> 35:25.173
What are you gonna
tell them now?

35:25.217 --> 35:27.565
Sir...?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.086
Is this how you
spend liberty?

36:28.521 --> 36:30.478
You like birds?

36:30.521 --> 36:32.869
It's for my dad.

36:32.913 --> 36:34.565
So you like your dad.

36:34.608 --> 36:36.086
Like the work.

36:36.130 --> 36:39.956
Makes me feel like
my head's on straight.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Well, look at you.

36:42.043 --> 36:43.869
That's the same reason
I run so much.

36:43.913 --> 36:47.086
Well, beating your times
is just an added bonus.

36:47.130 --> 36:48.478
You haven't
beaten my times.

36:48.521 --> 36:50.347
So you've been checking.

36:55.695 --> 36:58.869
Might make
a difference.

36:58.913 --> 37:00.869
My father can be
difficult, too.

37:00.913 --> 37:02.782
I never said he
was difficult.

37:02.826 --> 37:05.304
I know.

37:05.347 --> 37:07.130
But you love him, right?

37:07.173 --> 37:09.391
Well, it's just...

37:09.434 --> 37:11.826
You know, it's...Dads can't help it.

37:11.869 --> 37:14.000
There's no use holding it
against them.

37:16.652 --> 37:18.000
[slight chuckle]

37:18.043 --> 37:19.956
[chuckling]

37:20.000 --> 37:21.086
[laughing]

37:21.130 --> 37:22.913
Well, Gibbs.

37:26.173 --> 37:29.826
Good luck keeping that head
of yours on straight.

37:29.869 --> 37:31.956
Good luck trying
to beat my times.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Oh... I will.

37:58.565 --> 38:00.000
Hello, Mr. Flores.

38:04.434 --> 38:06.391
I've been spending
some time ere.

38:06.434 --> 38:10.130
Trying to get
used to it.

38:10.173 --> 38:12.173
I was right, wasn't I?

38:14.086 --> 38:16.043
Her body was on that plane.

38:16.086 --> 38:18.043
No.

38:19.478 --> 38:21.000
What do you mean?

38:21.043 --> 38:22.608
Where is she?

38:22.652 --> 38:27.521
Dog tags were found
at the scene... Gabriela wasn't.

38:27.565 --> 38:30.043
We don't have her body.

38:30.086 --> 38:32.043
Are you telling me
she's alive?

38:32.086 --> 38:34.130
I'm telling you we're still
looking for answers.

38:34.173 --> 38:36.956
You gotta find her.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.173
Agent Gibbs, you gotta put
every...

38:39.217 --> 38:41.478
ev-everything you've got
into finding her.

38:41.521 --> 38:43.347
We already are.

38:43.391 --> 38:45.304
No, no.

38:45.347 --> 38:46.739
Here.

38:46.782 --> 38:47.956
[sniffles]

38:48.000 --> 38:49.347
Here.

38:49.391 --> 38:51.217
She sent me this.

38:52.956 --> 38:56.434
That's Gabriela and the teacher
and one of their students.

38:56.478 --> 38:58.652
You see?

38:58.695 --> 39:00.956
All she cared about was giving
these girls a place to learn!

39:01.000 --> 39:04.217
If anybody on this earth
deserves your help,

39:04.260 --> 39:05.956
it's Gabriela.

39:07.173 --> 39:08.652
BURKE:
An Americana...

39:08.695 --> 39:10.043
GIBBS:
Excuse me.

39:10.086 --> 39:12.043
BURKE:
Hey, wait, Gibbs, Gibbs,
I just ordered.

39:12.086 --> 39:13.043
Come on, come on.
Later.

39:13.086 --> 39:14.739
That's the teacher.

39:14.782 --> 39:16.913
What do you see?What do you mean?

39:16.956 --> 39:18.739
Anyone who worked at that school
could be in on this.

39:18.782 --> 39:21.043
Look at her hand.

39:21.086 --> 39:24.043
BURKE:
Looks like there's a tattoo
under her ring.

39:24.086 --> 39:26.521
You ever see anything like that
in your two tours

39:26.565 --> 39:28.521
over there, Commander?

39:28.565 --> 39:31.000
ABBY:
The design is very intricate.

39:31.043 --> 39:33.478
It's beautiful... until we
discovered something else.

39:33.521 --> 39:35.043
Discovered what?

39:35.086 --> 39:36.869
Something not
very beautiful.

39:36.913 --> 39:39.652
This guy was arrested
for having an I.E.D.

39:39.695 --> 39:40.695
factory in his kitchen.

39:40.739 --> 39:42.043
He has the same tattoo,

39:42.086 --> 39:43.086
and it looks like

39:43.130 --> 39:44.695
this would-be
female suicide bomber

39:44.739 --> 39:46.043
out of Helmand

39:46.086 --> 39:48.000
has one, also.Any ties?

39:48.043 --> 39:49.347
ABBY:
They are both linked

39:49.391 --> 39:51.304
to the Jaysh El-Mo'mineen
insurgent group.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.913
Translation:
"Army of Believers."

39:53.956 --> 39:56.217
Does it say anything
about the design?

39:56.260 --> 39:58.086
Intel suggests
that it symbolizes

39:58.130 --> 39:59.652
entrance into martyrdom.

39:59.695 --> 40:01.217
Thank you.

40:03.956 --> 40:05.782
Start talking.

40:05.826 --> 40:07.130
Jaysh El-Mo'mineen.

40:07.173 --> 40:09.000
Small but growing.

40:09.043 --> 40:10.695
Specialties are I.E.D.'s,
direct assaults

40:10.739 --> 40:11.695
and employing females

40:11.739 --> 40:13.391
to advance attacks undetected.

40:13.434 --> 40:15.956
Chief mission is to get rid
of anything apple pie or NATO.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.608
They are known to hide
and move their headquarters

40:17.652 --> 40:19.913
in the remote
areas of the Chagai Hills.

40:19.956 --> 40:21.739
Bring up the satellite.

40:21.782 --> 40:25.043
Okay, but I've got nothing new
to show you, boss.

40:25.086 --> 40:26.652
I'm still waiting
on a better copy.

40:26.695 --> 40:27.956
I've tried everything
I can to sharpen it.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.000
Not sharper, McGee.

40:29.043 --> 40:30.826
GIBBS:
Wider. South.

40:30.869 --> 40:33.043
Chagai Hills are just south
of the attack point.

40:33.086 --> 40:35.043
McGEE:
It's nothing but desert.

40:36.652 --> 40:38.695
Wider, McGee.

40:38.739 --> 40:40.739
More than two kilometers. Go.

40:40.782 --> 40:42.956
McGEE:
Boss, what are we looking for?

40:49.434 --> 40:51.043
GIBBS:
Zoom in.

40:51.086 --> 40:54.000
Closer.

40:55.434 --> 40:56.434
That's gotta be her.

41:00.913 --> 41:02.347
Are those children?

41:05.391 --> 41:06.304
Two of them.

41:07.434 --> 41:09.043
She didn't die in the attack.

41:10.652 --> 41:13.000
No. She was trying
to save them...

41:13.043 --> 41:15.000
and she got caught.

41:15.043 --> 41:16.695
JARVIS:
What do we know
about the vehicle?

41:16.739 --> 41:18.304
COMMANDANT:
It's not one of ours.

41:18.347 --> 41:20.304
My analysts say the
truck is Russian-made,

41:20.347 --> 41:21.826
ten to 12
years old at least.

41:21.869 --> 41:22.956
And the kids?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.173
Likely boarders
at the school.

41:24.217 --> 41:25.173
Girls. Orphans.

41:25.217 --> 41:27.043
No one to report
them missing.

41:27.086 --> 41:28.826
JARVIS:
Chagai Hills?

41:28.869 --> 41:30.173
GIBBS:
Days ago.

41:30.217 --> 41:32.086
Difficult to track
after all this time.

41:32.130 --> 41:33.913
You say something
about moving mountains, sir?

41:33.956 --> 41:37.000
Plane leaves at 0500, Gibbs.

41:37.043 --> 41:38.913
My people will
get started.

41:38.956 --> 41:41.043
Don't come back without her.
