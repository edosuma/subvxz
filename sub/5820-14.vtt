01:24.040 --> 01:25.849
Morgan?

01:29.960 --> 01:32.361
Wh-- why?

01:37.400 --> 01:39.880
It'll give you
some choices next time.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.489
( Rattling )

03:06.640 --> 03:08.642
( sighs )

03:44.160 --> 03:45.685
( toy clatters )

03:45.840 --> 03:47.968
Didn't even notice.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.208
Got your bike back.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.011
Yeah.

03:53.160 --> 03:55.208
You got another one of those?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.442
( Sighs )

04:01.880 --> 04:03.962
Thanks.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.765
Those people you met,
the ones in the burnt forest,

04:13.920 --> 04:15.888
they took it from you?

04:16.040 --> 04:17.928
Yeah.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.723
You saved them,
right?

04:26.200 --> 04:29.204
Sorry.
It's who you are.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.646
We're still stuck with that.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.689
No, we ain't.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.127
I should've killed them.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.325
( Faint tap )

04:54.160 --> 04:55.446
<i>He'! '</i>

04:58.120 --> 05:00.361
The ones that took you
and Maggie...

05:00.520 --> 05:02.921
what'd they do to you?

05:07.720 --> 05:09.324
To us?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.562
They didn't do anything.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.522
( Garage door rattling )

05:36.840 --> 05:40.003
( creaking )

05:52.720 --> 05:55.690
( theme music playing )

06:29.800 --> 06:32.565
( snarling )

07:02.840 --> 07:04.046
So, if you didn't already have plans,

07:04.200 --> 07:06.567
I was thinking of making
my beef jerky stroganoff.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.768
I'm good, thanks.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.365
It's not exactly
a nice porterhouse,

07:10.520 --> 07:12.204
but I promise
it's better than it sounds.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.442
I'm sure it is.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.243
What?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.084
What are we doing?

07:22.480 --> 07:24.687
Just tell me.
It's good either way.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.644
It really is.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.970
Okay.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.805
- Okay is what we're doing?
- We'll do dinner.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.405
Okay?

07:35.600 --> 07:37.170
All right.

07:39.320 --> 07:40.731
See you then.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.848
Okay.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.161
( Sighs )

07:44.320 --> 07:47.608
I didn't hear you guys.

07:47.760 --> 07:51.128
Good. Today's lesson
will be in the cul-de-sac.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.847
Actually, can we do
something else?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.923
Denise: After I got out of DC,
I just drove.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.770
I remember seeing it
right when I realized

07:58.920 --> 08:00.365
I had no idea
where I was going.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.569
Edison's Apothecary and Boutique.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.769
It's just this little gift shop
in a strip mall,

08:06.960 --> 08:09.440
but if it's really an apothecary,

08:09.600 --> 08:11.250
they had drugs.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.767
Daryl: How do you know
they still got 'em?

08:13.920 --> 08:16.400
It isn't that far.
I just wanna check.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.848
And you and Rosita aren't out
scavenging or pulling shifts.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.411
We'll go.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.046
I wanted to check.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.407
I just wanted to help.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.404
How much time
you spend out there?

08:29.560 --> 08:31.085
- None.
- Forget it.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.851
I can ID the meds.
I know how to use a machete now.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.844
I've seen roamers up close.
I'm ready.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.731
- You good with this?
- No.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.645
- I'll go alone if I have to.
- You'll die alone.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.723
I'm asking you
to make sure I don't.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.884
I'm not babysitting her
by myself.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.120
( Gears grinding, screeching )

09:07.440 --> 09:10.250
It-- the...

09:10.440 --> 09:11.965
What?

09:12.120 --> 09:13.406
Forget it.

09:13.560 --> 09:17.451
- ( Gears grinding)
- No, what?

09:17.600 --> 09:21.685
I think maybe you're
disengaging it too soon.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.729
I've been driving stick
since I was 15,

09:23.880 --> 09:27.043
usually beat-up trucks
like this.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.487
I mean, before-- you know,
before I left home.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.688
( Gears grinding )

09:34.840 --> 09:37.684
My brother taught me,
so I just know.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.009
( Gears grinding )

09:49.600 --> 09:50.726
Daryl.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.129
Yep.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.370
Daryl:
Stay here.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.800
(walker snarling )

10:20.960 --> 10:22.405
I got it.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.925
(growling )

10:36.080 --> 10:38.731
This happened fast.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.928
Tree rotted out.
It wasn't people.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.768
( Growling stops )

11:01.760 --> 11:03.967
Come on, it's clear.

11:06.560 --> 11:07.721
What'd you find?

11:07.880 --> 11:10.486
Bottles of booze.
Any takers?

11:10.640 --> 11:11.801
No, thanks.

11:11.960 --> 11:13.644
For later. I'm not bringing these
to the pantry.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.006
I'm good.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.766
They were
kind of my parents' thing.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.526
Which is why they aren't mine.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.010
That truck ain't gonna
make it past this tree.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.328
- Come on, let's walk.
- Denise: Hold up.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.847
Looks like a straight shot
if we follow the tracks.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.451
No.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.409
No tracks.
We'll take the road.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.800
That's twice as far.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.480
Go whichever way you like.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.642
I ain't taking no tracks.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.682
We should stick together.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.964
(thunder rumbling )

12:03.120 --> 12:06.363
Abraham: I see you've tied back
your "Tennessee waterfall" there.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.208
Eugene: I won't lie. I liked it.
I may very well miss it.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.691
The feeling
of the billowy curtain

12:12.840 --> 12:16.367
catching the breeze some days
was straight-up bliss.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.170
But brass tacks--
the hair doesn't make the man,

12:18.320 --> 12:20.243
the man makes the man.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.042
Abraham:
Guard duty, weapons training,

12:24.200 --> 12:26.362
changing up the hairstyle,

12:26.520 --> 12:30.081
swigging some swagger
with the ladies, spitting game--

12:30.240 --> 12:33.210
Eugene: If you don't spit game,
you are game.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.727
Abraham:
Man seems to be changing.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.201
At least trying like hell to.

12:39.920 --> 12:45.245
Makes me curious
what that's about.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.767
It's simple, really.
As with any RPG,

12:47.920 --> 12:49.888
tabletop, electronic,
or otherwise,

12:50.080 --> 12:51.889
the key to survival
is allowing oneself

12:52.080 --> 12:54.082
to be shaped by the assigned
environment.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.561
In doing so, a broad range
of capabilities are acquired,

12:56.720 --> 12:58.927
allowing one to flip the script
and use said capabilities

12:59.080 --> 13:02.084
to shape said environment
for maximum longevity.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.926
I'm saying I'm in the process
of said stage two.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.323
I've changed, adapted.
I'm a survivor.

13:12.640 --> 13:15.007
(thunder rumbling )

13:15.160 --> 13:16.844
Keep telling yourself that.

13:19.240 --> 13:22.528
I've changed, adapted.
I've become a survivor.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.644
Rosita:
About time.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.207
I didn't mean to pick him
over you back there.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.488
It's just...

13:47.680 --> 13:50.286
You're holding it wrong.
Like this.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.930
Thanks.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.408
Denise:
Who taught you?

13:56.600 --> 13:58.443
You know, how to fight?

14:00.200 --> 14:02.487
Sorry, I didn't mean to bring up...

14:02.640 --> 14:04.768
Rosita: A lot of people taught me
a lot of things.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.322
Years from now, he'll just be
a name in a long list of names.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.168
( Knocking )

14:37.440 --> 14:38.965
All right, me and her
are gonna do this.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.360
You're gonna
stay back, got it?

14:40.560 --> 14:42.528
( Faintly )
Got it.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.120
( Creaks )

14:56.280 --> 14:58.009
Standard pin and tumbler.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.686
Tick-tick-click--
easy peasy.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.444
This the place?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.682
It is indeed.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.567
Okay.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.364
You about ready
to spill the pintos

15:14.520 --> 15:16.568
on what the hell it is
we're doing here?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.603
Yeah.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.205
Abraham:
Eugene.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.806
We're gonna
manufacture bullets here.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.249
I've been chewing the cud on this
for a few days now.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.006
The Hilltop's dry,
our supply's finite.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.168
So not only are bullets
vital for defense,

15:38.320 --> 15:39.845
but per the law
of supply and demand,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.281
a full cartridge is now
the coin of the land.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.283
Making bullets from scratch.

15:44.440 --> 15:47.569
Spent casings,
but the innards are all us.

15:47.720 --> 15:50.087
And by us, I mean me.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.527
And you think you can do that...

15:52.720 --> 15:55.291
here?

15:55.440 --> 15:57.841
With just this?

15:58.000 --> 16:00.401
Well, the digs will require
a thorough scrubbing.

16:02.040 --> 16:05.283
We'll have to scare up
a hella ton of lead, but, yes.

16:05.480 --> 16:09.849
I most definitely almost certainly
think I can do that here.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.765
That, my friend,
is some damn fine

16:12.920 --> 16:16.129
genuine
outside-the-box thinking.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.169
( Chuckles )

16:19.840 --> 16:21.046
Where do we start?

16:21.200 --> 16:23.043
Well, we should inform Rick,
talk with Olivia,

16:23.200 --> 16:25.521
see what types of ammo would be
most valuable to produce.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.286
I'm gonna hit "pause"
so I can kill that thing behind you.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.410
- ( Walker snarling )
- Pump your brakes, Red.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.324
I'm formally calling dibs
on this one.

16:33.480 --> 16:35.289
(walker snarling )

16:35.440 --> 16:36.805
Dibs is dibs.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.122
Abraham:
Well, be my guest.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.406
Get some.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.648
( Snarling )

16:42.800 --> 16:44.802
- ( clangs )
- Abraham: Strike one.

16:51.120 --> 16:52.645
Strike two.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.926
( Snarling stops )

17:07.079 --> 17:09.162
Why did you--?

17:09.319 --> 17:11.163
I called dibs.

17:13.920 --> 17:15.887
You had zero authority to--

17:16.040 --> 17:18.486
To what?
Stop you from dying?

17:18.680 --> 17:20.011
I had full control
of the situation.

17:20.160 --> 17:23.846
You'd have had better luck
picking up a turd by its clean end.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.924
I'm gonna allow you
to apologize for saying that.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.525
So how about
you do so right now?

17:28.680 --> 17:32.685
"Timmy" down there
almost ate your face, dumb-ass.

17:32.840 --> 17:36.208
- All due respect, screw you.
- Beg your pardon?

17:36.360 --> 17:38.249
Dispatching walkers
is well within my skill set,

17:38.400 --> 17:40.209
so screw you
for suggesting otherwise.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.805
Let me get something
straight, all right?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.611
Using your cabeza,
this whole DIY ammo thing,

17:44.760 --> 17:46.842
that is your damn skill set,

17:47.040 --> 17:48.530
just like ghosting hostiles,

17:48.680 --> 17:51.411
both of the undead and the living
variety, is mine.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.528
Now, you truly want to survive
this world long-term,

17:53.680 --> 17:56.047
I suggest you learn that
posthaste.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.044
Okay.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.601
Thank you for your protection.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.366
I most certainly needed it
between here and Houston.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.609
But your services
are no longer required.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.207
The truth, plain and honest.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.801
You've outlived
your usefulness to me.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.645
Is that so?

18:21.800 --> 18:24.087
Plain and honest.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.530
( Rebar clatters )

18:35.320 --> 18:36.970
- Where are you going?
- Home.

18:37.120 --> 18:41.648
My "services
are no longer required."

18:43.160 --> 18:45.401
Find your own way back.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.084

what you had for breakfast?

19:24.840 --> 19:26.968

If you set 'em on the counter,
I can tell you which.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.363
Daryl:
No, we're gonna take it all.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.090
Are you sure?
Because--

20:45.240 --> 20:47.049
No, it's fine.

- It sounds like it's stuck.

( glass shatters )

22:46.000 --> 22:49.482
- What the hell are you doing?
- Nothing.

22:57.360 --> 23:00.250
( Birds chirping )

( door opens )

23:37.280 --> 23:39.044

23:41.440 --> 23:44.171
You did good
finding this place.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.967
Tried to tell you
you weren't ready.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.642
- We both did.
- I know.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.290
So was he older or younger?

24:08.440 --> 24:10.807
Older.

24:10.960 --> 24:13.406
By six minutes.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.126
My parents came up
with the Dennis/Denise thing

24:17.280 --> 24:19.806
on one of their benders.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.247
Hilarious, right?

24:24.800 --> 24:27.371
Nothing scared him.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.522
He was brave.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.368
He was angry, too.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.642
It's kind of a dangerous
combination.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.122
Sounds like we had
the same brother.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.125
<i>He'! '</i>

24:52.280 --> 24:55.090
This Way's faster, right?

( Locusts chirping )

25:54.480 --> 25:56.960
(growling )

26:01.160 --> 26:03.288
There's a cooler in there!

26:03.440 --> 26:05.841
Might be something
we can use inside.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.371
We got what we came for.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.808
Nah, ain't worth the trouble.
Come on.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.685
(walker pounding )

26:43.320 --> 26:46.210

26:46.360 --> 26:47.521

26:51.800 --> 26:53.723
Shit.

26:53.920 --> 26:56.082
(grunting )

27:01.040 --> 27:03.088
No, don't!

27:19.720 --> 27:22.610

27:40.440 --> 27:41.965
( retches )

27:42.120 --> 27:44.202
( coughs, spits )

27:44.360 --> 27:46.362
Oh, man.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.841
I threw up on my glasses.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.488
- Hot damn.
- What the hell was that?

28:18.600 --> 28:20.602
You could've died right there,
you know that?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.404
Yeah, I do.

28:22.560 --> 28:25.131
- Are you hearing me?
- Who gives a shit?

28:25.280 --> 28:27.123
You could've died
killing those Saviors,

28:27.280 --> 28:30.170
both of you,
but you didn't.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.163
You wanna live,
you take chances.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.004
That's how it works.

28:34.160 --> 28:36.401
That's what I did.

28:36.560 --> 28:40.849
- For a couple of damn sodas?
- Nope.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.401
Just this one.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.570
Are you seriously that stupid?

28:54.720 --> 28:56.882
( Panting )

28:57.040 --> 28:59.884
Are you?

29:00.040 --> 29:03.044
I mean it. Are you?

29:03.200 --> 29:05.521
Do you have any clue

29:05.720 --> 29:10.089
what that was to me--
what this whole thing is to me?

29:10.240 --> 29:13.369
See, I have training in this shit.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.050
I'm not making it up
as I go along,

29:15.200 --> 29:19.046
like with the stitches
and the surgery and the--

29:21.880 --> 29:24.804
I asked you to come with me
because you're brave like my brother

29:24.960 --> 29:27.042
and sometimes you actually
make me feel safe.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.166
And I wanted you here
because you're alone.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.131
Probably for the first time
in your life.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.362
And because you're stronger
than you think you are,

29:38.520 --> 29:41.330
which gives me hope
that maybe I can be, too.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.411
I could've gone with Tara.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.484
I could've told herl loved her,
but I didn't...

29:52.680 --> 29:55.286
because I was afraid.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.687
That's what's stupid.

29:57.840 --> 30:01.890
Not coming out here,
not facing my shit.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.042
And it makes me sick

30:04.200 --> 30:05.725
that you guys
aren't even trying

30:05.880 --> 30:08.008
because you're strong
and you're smart

30:08.200 --> 30:10.009
and you're both
really good people,

30:10.200 --> 30:11.531
and if you don't wake...

30:11.680 --> 30:14.365
up...

30:14.520 --> 30:17.410
and face your...

30:22.600 --> 30:25.763
(guns clicking)

30:31.920 --> 30:34.969
Man:
You drop 'em now!

30:56.800 --> 30:58.802
D:
Well, hell.

31:06.920 --> 31:10.242
You got something
to say to me?

31:10.400 --> 31:12.243
You gonna clear the air?

31:12.400 --> 31:15.006
Step up on that high horse?

31:16.240 --> 31:17.810
No.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.281
You don't talk much.

31:35.760 --> 31:37.683
Still getting the hang of her.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.366
- Kicks like a bitch, but--
- I should've done it.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.171
Oh, what's that?

31:48.680 --> 31:50.921
Seriously, I didn't catch
what you said.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.208
I shoulda killed you.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.367
Yeah, you probably should've.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.727
So, here we are.

32:01.880 --> 32:04.201
Kind of begs the question, right?

32:04.400 --> 32:07.643
Who brought this on who?

32:07.800 --> 32:12.522
I mean, I get that you'll just have
to take my word for this, but...

32:13.760 --> 32:16.525
she wasn't even the one
I was aiming for.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.480
Like I said...

32:20.640 --> 32:23.166
kicks like a bitch.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.971
It's nothing personal.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.727
Look, this isn't how we like to start
new business arrangements,

32:29.920 --> 32:32.924
but, well, you pricks kinda
set the tone, didn't you?

32:33.080 --> 32:34.445
What do you want?

32:34.600 --> 32:36.967
D: I'm sorry, darlin',
I didn't catch your name.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.646
I'm D, or Dwight.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.690
You can call me either.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.286
So...

32:45.480 --> 32:46.970
What's your name?

32:47.120 --> 32:49.964
Rosita.
What do you want?

32:50.120 --> 32:52.851
Well, Rosita...

32:53.000 --> 32:55.526
it's not what I want.

32:55.680 --> 32:58.729
It's what you and Daryl
are going to do.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.406
You're going to let us
into your little complex.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.769
It looks like it's just
beautiful in there.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.645
And then you're going
to let us take whatever

33:07.800 --> 33:10.280
and whoever we want...

33:12.160 --> 33:14.970
or we blow
Eugene's brains out.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.690
And then yours.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.888
And then his.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.522
I hope it doesn't
come to that, really.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.489
Nobody else has to die.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.962
We just try and start with one.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.168
You know...

33:30.360 --> 33:33.489
maximum impact
to get our point across.

33:33.640 --> 33:37.201
So what's it gonna be?
You tell me.

33:37.360 --> 33:40.523
You wanna kill someone,
you start with our companion

33:40.680 --> 33:43.650
hiding over there
behind the oil barrels.

33:43.800 --> 33:46.883
He's a first-class a-hole and he
deserves it so much more than us three.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.642

Bullet just grazed him,

but it's a good thing we got him
back when we did.

Rosita: Antibiotics we picked up
could save him from an infection.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.362
Could save his life.

Good.

You found it.

Do you apologize
for questioning my skills?

I apologize
for questioning your skills.

37:40.400 --> 37:43.006
You know how to bite a dick,
Eugene.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.731
I mean that
with the utmost of respect.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.565
Welcome to stage two.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.405
Don't need to welcome me.

You said I had choices.

38:27.440 --> 38:29.727
You have them, too.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.930
Could be 30 years for us here.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.361
