00:08.500 --> 00:09.934
My name
is melinda gordon.

00:10.731 --> 00:13.401
I'm married,
i live in a small town,

00:14.094 --> 00:15.568
and i own
an antique shop.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.623
I might be just like you.

00:18.158 --> 00:19.803
Except that from the time
i was a little girl,

00:19.804 --> 00:21.788
i knew that i could
talk to the dead.

00:22.201 --> 00:23.867
Grandmother:
It's all right, honey.

00:23.934 --> 00:26.134
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:26.756 --> 00:28.690
They're stuck here
because they have unfinished

00:28.693 --> 00:29.484
business with the living

00:29.555 --> 00:31.225
and they come to me
for help.

00:34.655 --> 00:36.589
In order to tell you
my story,

00:36.659 --> 00:38.722
i have to tell you
theirs.

00:51.595 --> 00:54.071
Hey, do you want to see
what i'm getting jim?

00:54.078 --> 00:55.171
Sure.

00:55.245 --> 00:57.013
Walk with me.
It's in shiffman's window.

00:57.076 --> 00:58.010
What's the occasion?

00:58.078 --> 00:59.510
It's our anniversary
on friday.

00:59.576 --> 01:00.610
5 years.

01:00.677 --> 01:01.571
Really?

01:01.576 --> 01:03.412
I didn't know
you guys were together
for 5 years.

01:03.476 --> 01:05.110
No, we haven't been.
It's the night we met.

01:05.516 --> 01:07.523
Wait. You're celebrating
the night you met?

01:07.527 --> 01:10.240
That's disgusting.
Was it romantic?

01:10.247 --> 01:12.002
Yeah.
A little scary, too.

01:12.075 --> 01:14.270
Anyway, there it is.

01:14.347 --> 01:15.441
What? Where?

01:15.505 --> 01:17.871
Right there.
And it actually works.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.670
That's sweet.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.440
You know, jim's been
so busy lately,

01:22.506 --> 01:25.301
he hasn't even mentioned
our anniversary.

01:26.306 --> 01:27.573
I think he forgot.

01:27.645 --> 01:31.440
Really? Um... did he say
he wanted one of those?

01:31.516 --> 01:33.473
It means something to us.

01:33.546 --> 01:34.742
Ok.

01:36.206 --> 01:39.543
I will never get used
to that sound.

01:39.605 --> 01:40.842
Is jim working tonight?

02:06.206 --> 02:08.401
Man: Are you guys safe?

02:08.475 --> 02:11.043
As long as you
all are safe.

02:16.646 --> 02:18.873
Ok. Come on.
I'll get you home.

02:18.945 --> 02:21.040
Do you see jim
anywhere?

02:21.046 --> 02:22.041
No.

02:30.948 --> 02:31.840
You're all right.

02:31.847 --> 02:32.901
Wait. There he is.
He's right there.

02:32.917 --> 02:34.341
He's right there
with that guy!

02:41.418 --> 02:44.371
Jim! Jim! Jim!

02:45.375 --> 02:46.612
I'm lit! I'm lit!

02:48.847 --> 02:50.341
Hey, no!

02:50.416 --> 02:52.373
No, please, please,
see if everybody's out.

02:55.347 --> 02:57.301
It's empty, it's empty.
It's all right.

02:58.645 --> 02:59.941
Did everyone
get out?

03:00.015 --> 03:02.510
Please, please,
make sure.

03:03.878 --> 03:05.370
Let us take a look at you.

03:05.847 --> 03:07.370
Get him some oxygen,
get some water.

03:07.445 --> 03:08.843
Are you ok?

04:22.566 --> 04:25.933
Ahh. You see, they saved
the basic structure,

04:25.997 --> 04:28.131
but the interior's
totaled.

04:28.206 --> 04:29.763
What a shame.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.293
And it was
the opening night.

04:31.367 --> 04:32.961
Mm-mmm. Re-opening.

04:33.037 --> 04:37.492
That thing burned down once
before, like a year ago.

04:37.567 --> 04:40.533
And i think i have it
bad when i can't find
a parking space.

04:40.596 --> 04:41.763
Ooh. Ouch.

04:41.837 --> 04:42.831
No, that's my line.

04:42.897 --> 04:44.861
You're too tough
and stoic.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.433
Oh, it's good
you reminded me,

04:46.497 --> 04:49.333
'cause i wanted
to scream when you were
taking off my shirt.

04:49.398 --> 04:50.992
You want a hot pack?

04:51.065 --> 04:52.690
No. Enough heat
for one night.

04:52.765 --> 04:54.131
Ice?
No thanks.

04:54.207 --> 04:56.791
Look, tell me more
about this ghost.

04:56.867 --> 04:57.993
He was on fire?

04:58.066 --> 04:59.963
Yeah. He felt
pretty powerful.

05:00.037 --> 05:01.791
But nobody died
in the fire.
Where'd he come from?

05:01.866 --> 05:02.733
I  don't know.

05:02.738 --> 05:04.593
It like he was getting
his power from the fire.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.030
I mean, he looked at me,
and i got the chills.

05:08.336 --> 05:09.691
Chills. Get it?

05:09.766 --> 05:11.430
Oh, all right.
You're delirious.

05:11.495 --> 05:12.493
Get some sleep.

05:12.505 --> 05:14.633
You're going to be so sore
in the morning.

05:14.697 --> 05:18.990
Oh, i'm already
sore as hell.

05:19.066 --> 05:20.630
Ah. Hell? Fire?

05:20.695 --> 05:21.830
Ok, sleep
before i slap you.

05:21.898 --> 05:23.833
All right.

05:23.898 --> 05:25.732
I think
everything'll be fine

05:25.795 --> 05:28.201
as long as i'm
better by friday.

05:29.365 --> 05:33.163
Really?
Well, what's friday?

05:33.237 --> 05:34.893
Poker night
at richie's.

05:36.538 --> 05:38.791
I didn't know that.

05:38.865 --> 05:40.282
Is it sore right there?

05:40.287 --> 05:42.532
Ow!
Oh, i'm so sorry.

05:59.336 --> 06:00.933
There's
no reason to panic.

06:00.996 --> 06:03.193
Interior collapsed
in the building
next door.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.333
There's no fire
jumping.

06:06.668 --> 06:08.493
Oh, my slipper.

06:09.838 --> 06:12.993
I can walk on my own
just fine, thank you.

06:14.538 --> 06:15.560
You're welcome.

06:48.167 --> 06:49.631
Oh!

06:51.397 --> 06:52.663
So, what is it?

06:52.738 --> 06:53.832
The gift.

06:53.838 --> 06:56.660
I just had to get it
out of the window
before jim saw it.

06:56.737 --> 06:59.061
Anyway, i'm only
going to leave it
here until friday.

06:59.138 --> 07:00.891
So, do you know what
he's going to get you?

07:00.965 --> 07:02.760
Uh, i think he forgot.

07:02.835 --> 07:05.030
He has plans to play
poker on friday night.

07:05.105 --> 07:07.160
Ohh. Trouble
in padise?

07:07.236 --> 07:09.530
No, he's just been exhausted,
working doubles.

07:09.538 --> 07:12.100
And he got his dates
mixed up.

07:12.168 --> 07:14.532
He'll realize it,
figure it out.

07:14.597 --> 07:17.890
So, do you want me
to drop a hint the
next time i see him?

07:17.966 --> 07:18.493
I'm pretty good at it.

07:18.507 --> 07:19.490
No, it's ok. Thanks.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.502
I really want him
to remember on his own.

07:22.507 --> 07:25.201
I mean, it was a big night
for him... for us.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.373
I just can't believe
that he would forget.

07:27.435 --> 07:28.802
Do you smell smoke?

07:28.875 --> 07:30.302
Mm-mmm. You know,

07:30.378 --> 07:32.300
it's probably just
some leftover stink

07:32.376 --> 07:33.972
from the fire
the other night.

07:34.048 --> 07:35.301
I still smell it
on my clothes.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.003
Reminds me
of my clubbing days.

07:41.046 --> 07:42.201
Professor payne!

07:42.278 --> 07:43.831
I can't tell you
how many times

07:43.908 --> 07:47.733
i've walked past
this store and was almost
tempted to come in.

07:47.746 --> 07:49.370
I'm honored. I think.

07:49.436 --> 07:52.671
Delia banks,
this is professor payne
from rockland university.

07:52.677 --> 07:53.600
He teaches a course on...

07:53.675 --> 07:56.502
i teach the use of symbols
in the world of the occult.

07:56.576 --> 08:00.103
Man's need to believe
in the unbelievable.

08:00.178 --> 08:01.803
O-kay.

08:01.877 --> 08:05.332
Uh, i'm going to go
across the street and
get some air freshener.

08:07.408 --> 08:09.602
Air  freshener? Did i...

08:09.675 --> 08:11.773
nothing to do with you.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.442
Your husband got knocked
down in that fire.

08:15.447 --> 08:16.982
Is he ok?
Yes, thanks.

08:16.985 --> 08:18.482
I met him, you know.
I know.

08:18.557 --> 08:19.720
He's a nice man,
your husband.

08:19.787 --> 08:20.492
I know.

08:20.507 --> 08:21.921
Does he always
drool like that?

08:21.926 --> 08:24.752
He's a mouth breather.
Is that a problem?

08:24.827 --> 08:27.250
I don't think
you came here to just
make fun of my husband.

08:27.323 --> 08:29.684
No, i did not,
although i do enjoy it.

08:29.755 --> 08:33.554
I  miss you.
I miss you, and i...

08:33.625 --> 08:35.089
you're avoiding me.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.090
Not intentionally.

08:36.105 --> 08:37.172
Did i scare you off?

08:37.178 --> 08:38.751
I don't scare easily.

08:38.756 --> 08:39.753
Crazy. It's...

08:46.058 --> 08:48.350
new neck exercise?

08:50.686 --> 08:52.083
yes, actually.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.023
You know,
that reminds me, i have
a question for you.

08:54.028 --> 08:54.840
You always have
a question for me.

08:54.857 --> 08:56.493
This time before you ask,

08:56.515 --> 08:59.152
let's talk a little
quid pro quo.

08:59.226 --> 09:01.181
If you get to ask a question,
i get to ask you a question.

09:01.257 --> 09:02.653
Ok. What's
your question?

09:02.727 --> 09:04.151
How many college
professors does it take

09:04.225 --> 09:05.550
to screw
in a light bulb?

09:05.625 --> 09:07.381
No, don't answer that.
That's not the real question.

09:07.456 --> 09:08.650
My question to you is...

09:08.728 --> 09:10.822
do you claim to have
supernatural powers?

09:10.896 --> 09:13.422
Define "supernatural."

09:13.485 --> 09:15.152
Ahh! Now we're
getting somewhere.

09:15.225 --> 09:20.380
Supernatural meaning,
not of this world.

09:20.458 --> 09:23.922
Do you claim to be connected
to the supernatural?

09:23.996 --> 09:26.481
Sometimes
it feels that way.

09:26.557 --> 09:27.493
How do you...

09:27.505 --> 09:29.592
ok, that was
your one question.
Now it's my turn.

09:29.668 --> 09:31.663
If somebody said to you

09:31.738 --> 09:36.063
that there would
be 5 signs and then
death would come,

09:36.916 --> 09:37.911
what would you think?

09:37.915 --> 09:39.352
I would think about
selling my house

09:39.415 --> 09:40.650
and moving to the nearest
police station.

09:40.716 --> 09:41.813
I'm being serious.

09:41.886 --> 09:43.083
That's what scares me.

09:44.457 --> 09:45.913
I mean, aside from...

09:49.585 --> 09:50.683
5...

09:50.755 --> 09:53.952
5 represents
the unification of 2,

09:54.016 --> 09:55.180
in the feminine element,

09:55.256 --> 09:57.652
and 3, the masculine element.

09:57.717 --> 09:59.051
Unification?

09:59.116 --> 10:00.310
5.

10:00.385 --> 10:03.680
5 represents the 5 senses,

10:03.756 --> 10:05.413
the 5 wounds of the christ,

10:05.485 --> 10:09.253
the 5... the 5 pillars
of piety.

10:09.316 --> 10:12.711
In islam 5 is a big one.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.652
A powerful, strong number.

10:14.718 --> 10:16.783
Let's not kid
ourselves, sister.

10:16.858 --> 10:20.010
It wasn't the jackson 4.

10:22.586 --> 10:23.952
So what's going on?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.553
Not yet.

10:27.956 --> 10:30.483
Hi. Can i help you?

10:31.308 --> 10:32.550
Thanks for coming.

11:55.555 --> 11:57.151
Who are you?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.311
It burns.

12:00.615 --> 12:02.153
Everything burns.

12:02.216 --> 12:03.883
What does that mean?

12:03.958 --> 12:05.350
He knows.

12:07.716 --> 12:09.011
He knows why.

12:10.088 --> 12:11.310
Who knows?

12:19.228 --> 12:19.700
so, what are
we saying here?

12:19.705 --> 12:21.302
The ghost set the fire
at the restaurant?

12:21.375 --> 12:22.471
Let's just say
he caused it.

12:22.538 --> 12:24.391
He said "he knows,
he knows why."

12:24.396 --> 12:25.721
Who? The owner?

12:25.727 --> 12:28.051
Yeah. You said that
it had burned down
once before, right?

12:28.056 --> 12:29.320
Yeah, about a year ago.

12:29.398 --> 12:31.851
Ahh. See? That's the one
i need to know more about.

12:31.927 --> 12:34.723
Hey, you know
my buddy freddy diaz?

12:34.796 --> 12:37.090
I've heard you talk about him,
but i've never met him.

12:37.097 --> 12:38.821
He's the county
arson investigator.

12:38.896 --> 12:40.261
He's been on
the scene all week.

12:40.326 --> 12:41.491
Arson?

12:41.505 --> 12:43.490
Does that mean
i'm not the only one
who thinks it was set?

12:43.508 --> 12:44.723
No, it's routine.

12:44.728 --> 12:46.533
You see, every fire gets
investigated the same way

12:46.536 --> 12:48.301
until they've figured out
how it happened.

12:48.367 --> 12:49.852
So, look, i don't think
you're going to find

12:49.857 --> 12:50.991
any wanted posters
for ghosts.

12:51.068 --> 12:52.090
So, why don't
you go, talk to him,

12:52.166 --> 12:53.230
see what
he can tell you?

12:53.237 --> 12:55.430
I'll give him a head's
up. You want a glass?

12:55.505 --> 12:56.501
Mm-mmm.
Ok.

12:56.566 --> 12:58.993
Mmm. Thank you.

13:16.168 --> 13:18.361
Melinda, my husband's
still in there.

13:18.437 --> 13:20.780
Are you sure?
Maybe he came out
around the corner.

13:20.786 --> 13:22.130
No! No.
He's in there.

13:22.197 --> 13:24.300
He's at the bottom
of the stairs.

13:24.366 --> 13:26.791
Ok.

13:26.868 --> 13:28.462
I'm really sorry
to bother you.

13:28.538 --> 13:30.163
Excuse me, ma'am.
You're supposed to be
behind the barricade.

13:30.237 --> 13:31.403
There's a man
trapped inside.

13:31.465 --> 13:32.731
No, there isn't. We got
everybody outside.

13:32.795 --> 13:34.301
Please believe me.

13:36.795 --> 13:38.130
Noah.

13:38.197 --> 13:39.131
Yo?

13:39.198 --> 13:40.130
Come on.

13:40.196 --> 13:41.132
Where we going?

13:41.195 --> 13:43.030
Back  inside.

13:43.098 --> 13:44.663
You're welcome.

13:51.196 --> 13:53.300
Man: Everything ok?

13:53.838 --> 13:54.930
Is everything ok?

13:55.798 --> 13:59.331
Oh, i'm sorry.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.661
You looked like you were
a million miles away there.

14:01.738 --> 14:02.792
You caught me.

14:02.866 --> 14:05.332
Actually, i'm looking
for freddy diaz.

14:05.405 --> 14:06.400
Oh, that's me.

14:06.468 --> 14:07.401
You are...

14:07.466 --> 14:08.490
hi. I'm melinda gordon.

14:08.508 --> 14:10.363
I think that you know
my husband, jim clancy.

14:10.438 --> 14:11.490
Oh, are you kidding?

14:11.505 --> 14:13.560
You have any idea how
much beer i have consumed

14:13.637 --> 14:15.992
with  that man
over the course of...

14:16.065 --> 14:17.501
anyway. Uh...

14:17.568 --> 14:19.031
what can i do for you?

14:20.598 --> 14:22.730
The first fire happened
in the middle of the night.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.732
They were closed,
no customers.

14:24.785 --> 14:26.661
Did you investigate
that one, too?

14:26.738 --> 14:27.990
Oh, yeah.

14:28.065 --> 14:29.860
Figured that one out
in about a half-hour.

14:29.936 --> 14:30.862
Arson?

14:30.937 --> 14:32.202
In a big way.

14:32.265 --> 14:33.332
How can you tell?

14:33.405 --> 14:34.792
Tons of ways.

14:34.865 --> 14:36.133
You look
for accelerants,

14:36.207 --> 14:38.530
pour patterns,
ignition sources.

14:38.606 --> 14:40.232
But the surest way
to know is when you find

14:40.306 --> 14:42.231
the arsonist's
body right where
the fire started.

14:42.307 --> 14:43.561
Pretty much a slam dunk.

14:44.527 --> 14:46.270
Someone died in that fire?

14:46.288 --> 14:47.282
Co-owner.

14:47.347 --> 14:49.682
Tried to screw
his ex-partner over.

14:49.745 --> 14:51.443
Insurance scam
is what we figured.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.081
See it all the time.

14:53.147 --> 14:55.442
It's amazing
what people try
to get away with.

14:55.517 --> 14:57.713
Not too smart, though.

14:57.788 --> 14:59.740
Guy burned to death.

14:59.818 --> 15:02.942
People have
no idea how fast
a fire can spread.

15:02.946 --> 15:03.942
What about this fire?

15:04.045 --> 15:05.780
Any idea what caused it?

15:05.845 --> 15:08.043
This matters to you, why?

15:08.118 --> 15:10.943
Sorry. I'm just doing some
research on arson, fire,

15:11.018 --> 15:12.283
things like that.

15:12.347 --> 15:14.283
Mmm. You mean,
for a book or something?

15:14.348 --> 15:16.012
You never can tell.

15:16.087 --> 15:18.541
I haven't found
any evidence
to suggest arson.

15:18.616 --> 15:21.442
We're gonna keep
looking though.

15:21.515 --> 15:23.283
Say hi to jim
for me.

15:23.346 --> 15:24.611
Watch your step
on the way out.

15:24.688 --> 15:25.683
Thanks.

16:00.317 --> 16:01.682
Lilly chen.

16:14.545 --> 16:16.142
Lilly.

16:17.605 --> 16:18.302
What is that?

16:18.308 --> 16:19.380
Stained glass?

16:19.388 --> 16:20.583
Everything will burn.

16:22.146 --> 16:24.002
Everyone will burn.

16:24.077 --> 16:25.441
Yeah.

16:28.626 --> 16:29.722
I'm fine.

16:29.796 --> 16:32.290
I just got so hot
i couldn't breathe.

16:32.365 --> 16:34.792
I can't decide whether
to move into the firehouse

16:34.795 --> 16:36.101
or have the firehouse
move in here.

16:36.108 --> 16:38.673
Well, at least i know
who the ghost is.

16:38.676 --> 16:40.771
It's the guy who set
fire to his own restaurant?

16:40.777 --> 16:41.290
Yes.

16:41.306 --> 16:43.763
And then a year later
set fire to it again,
after he died?

16:43.766 --> 16:45.061
I think so.
Why?

16:45.128 --> 16:48.020
Maybe... i don't know.

16:48.025 --> 16:51.193
Maybe he's been
in some kind of sleep
state all this time.

16:51.266 --> 16:54.961
You know, it does
usually take some
big event or...

16:55.028 --> 16:57.121
i don't know,
some kind of ripple.

16:57.195 --> 17:00.820
And you think the re-opening
of the restaurant set him off?

17:00.827 --> 17:02.261
Well, yeah!

17:03.368 --> 17:04.721
I need you to lie down.

17:06.464 --> 17:07.662
That's not lying down.

17:07.728 --> 17:09.260
Well, why don't you
turn your head sideways,

17:09.326 --> 17:11.121
and then it'll look
like i'm lying down?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.423
You are a terrible patient.

17:13.497 --> 17:16.891
He said that everything
was going to burn.

17:16.964 --> 17:18.121
Every one
was going to burn.

17:18.196 --> 17:19.760
What for?
I don't know.

17:19.826 --> 17:22.223
But, you know,
he's obviously coming
to me for some reason.

17:22.228 --> 17:23.310
Maybe he wants my help.

17:23.316 --> 17:25.211
And maybe he's
just completely evil,

17:25.214 --> 17:26.261
and he enjoys the attention.

17:26.327 --> 17:27.820
Either way i have
to cross him over

17:27.897 --> 17:29.493
before he burns
something else down.

17:30.506 --> 17:32.092
All right.

17:32.167 --> 17:35.732
You said
he recognized his wife?

17:35.798 --> 17:36.931
Yeah, he said her name.

17:36.938 --> 17:38.433
I tried to find her
before you got home,

17:38.496 --> 17:39.931
and there's no listing
for her anywhere.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.462
Why don't you talk
to that guy jesse
at the restaurant?

17:41.537 --> 17:43.330
He knows...
warren chen.

17:43.397 --> 17:44.902
Right. His partner.
Talk to him,

17:44.968 --> 17:46.160
see what he can tell you.

17:47.995 --> 17:49.930
Can you get me
his address?

17:49.935 --> 17:53.730
Well... that depends
what's in it for me.

17:57.808 --> 17:59.931
How's your
blood pressure?

18:00.005 --> 18:01.431
Elevated.

18:03.716 --> 18:04.642
Now lie down.

18:04.717 --> 18:05.983
Ok, i'll lie down.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.582
I hope you don't mind
if i keep working.

18:10.646 --> 18:12.840
I got to get
this place in shape.

18:12.918 --> 18:14.983
It's gotta go on
the market next week.

18:15.047 --> 18:17.643
I know that
this is a bad time
for you right now.

18:17.718 --> 18:19.581
Yeah. Well, that's
what happens when you lose

18:19.647 --> 18:21.313
a business twice
in one year.

18:21.386 --> 18:23.312
Wasn't there
any insurance?

18:23.387 --> 18:27.043
Yeah, but with the first one,
they didn't want to pay.

18:27.116 --> 18:29.310
Insurance companies
tend to frown on arson.

18:29.386 --> 18:32.311
Then i had to borrow money
from my father to rebuild,

18:32.387 --> 18:34.111
and no one wanted to insure
the new place.

18:34.188 --> 18:37.211
Look, i really appreciate
what your husband did for me,

18:37.216 --> 18:39.642
but i really don't
want to think about any
of this right now.

18:39.717 --> 18:44.243
I'd like to talk
about the first fire,
last year.

18:44.315 --> 18:45.513
And warren chen.

18:45.516 --> 18:47.483
Why  are you doing this?
What do you want from me?

18:47.546 --> 18:49.381
I'd just like
to know more about him.

18:51.115 --> 18:54.313
Warren was my partner,
and he was my friend.

18:54.387 --> 18:55.682
He burned down
your restaurant.

18:55.748 --> 18:58.283
And it broke my heart!
He was like a brother to me.

18:58.288 --> 19:00.440
Look, i don't know why he did
what he did that night.

19:00.518 --> 19:01.941
But you didn't know him,

19:02.016 --> 19:03.503
and you can't come here
and talk about him

19:03.505 --> 19:05.310
like he's some kind
of criminal.

19:05.388 --> 19:07.443
Ok, i'm sorry.

19:07.515 --> 19:10.040
Ok. Well, now
i have things to do.

19:10.115 --> 19:12.341
What about lilly?

19:12.417 --> 19:13.501
Do you know
where she is?

19:13.507 --> 19:15.501
She had a total
breakdown after warren.

19:15.505 --> 19:18.513
Look, what do you want
from her and what do you
want from me?

19:18.587 --> 19:20.311
I'm sorry.

19:20.387 --> 19:21.502
I didn't mean to...

19:21.508 --> 19:23.010
just leave us alone.
Leave me alone.

19:23.088 --> 19:25.842
Leave her alone.
We've l been through enough.

19:28.187 --> 19:31.880
I really hate being
the only one who knows
how that fire got started.

19:31.947 --> 19:34.043
So, did jesse
say anything helpful?

19:34.116 --> 19:35.643
No. He's pretty raw.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.481
I'm guess i'm going
to have to find lilly

19:37.546 --> 19:39.012
and see if she knows
anything that can help.

19:39.088 --> 19:39.751
Well, how are you going
to do that?

19:39.767 --> 19:41.710
You said there
was no listing.

19:41.787 --> 19:42.582
You can help me.

19:42.587 --> 19:43.741
I knew that was coming.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.141
Ok. All you have
to do is find out

19:45.217 --> 19:46.242
where she lived
with warren.

19:46.247 --> 19:48.112
I'm sure
there's a record
from the last fire.

19:48.186 --> 19:49.683
She might
still be there.

19:49.745 --> 19:51.181
I'll take a look.

19:51.248 --> 19:52.180
Ok.

19:52.248 --> 19:53.183
One kiss.

19:53.248 --> 19:54.413
Go to work.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.211
They're gonna take a look.

20:06.286 --> 20:09.312
Don't worry.

20:12.288 --> 20:13.482
Let's go, let's go.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.183
There's somebody
still here.

20:19.515 --> 20:20.110
You ok?

20:20.117 --> 20:21.040
I'm all right.

20:21.115 --> 20:22.112
Let's do this.

20:23.446 --> 20:24.610
Anybody here?!

20:24.686 --> 20:25.782
Can you hear us?

20:25.847 --> 20:27.743
If you can hear us,
make a sound!

20:28.816 --> 20:30.041
Did you hear that?
What's that?

20:31.118 --> 20:32.242
Man: Get out!

20:32.315 --> 20:34.203
I hear something.
I think someone's here.

20:34.816 --> 20:35.723
Turn off the radio.
Radios off.

20:41.795 --> 20:43.752
Right there.
That's it.

20:50.997 --> 20:52.091
We got 2!

20:52.157 --> 20:54.221
Radio: We got them!
We found them!

20:54.297 --> 20:56.121
Move it!
Let's go!

21:38.757 --> 21:41.521
Make sure you
check on him, ok?

21:41.527 --> 21:42.791
Make sure he's ok?

21:43.155 --> 21:44.991
I will.

21:45.055 --> 21:46.222
Thank you.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.493
Hey, i'm going
across to lentos
on the square.

22:44.508 --> 22:45.141
You want anything?

22:45.147 --> 22:46.073
No, thanks.

22:46.147 --> 22:47.142
Whatcha looking up?

22:47.205 --> 22:48.673
Trying to find someone.

22:48.745 --> 22:50.471
Aren't we all?
Old friend?

22:50.545 --> 22:51.640
Not really.

22:51.717 --> 22:52.872
Old enemy?

22:52.948 --> 22:55.443
It's a long story.

22:55.515 --> 22:57.373
I'm starting
to get the idea

22:57.445 --> 23:00.142
that there's
a lot of long stories
attached to you.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.143
More than you know.

23:02.208 --> 23:03.803
Hey, it's cool,
i was just gonna...

23:03.878 --> 23:06.001
you know, it's a friend
of mine whose husband died,

23:06.078 --> 23:07.710
and i'm trying
to check up on her,

23:07.778 --> 23:09.513
but i don't
know how to find her.

23:09.578 --> 23:11.002
Phone book?

23:11.077 --> 23:12.943
No, i tried
the old number and it just
said disconnected.

23:13.007 --> 23:16.070
Hmm. You know,
i love those kind
of good puzzles.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.102
Yeah. I'll figure
this one out.

23:18.175 --> 23:22.342
So, has jim remembered
your anniversary yet?

23:22.415 --> 23:25.773
No. He's still playing
poker on friday night.

23:26.808 --> 23:28.373
Time for a hint?

23:29.505 --> 23:31.331
I don't want to trick him
into remembering.

23:31.336 --> 23:35.331
You know, men have so
much crap on their minds
this time of year.

23:35.408 --> 23:38.101
There's football,
basketball,
ice hockey...

23:38.167 --> 23:40.301
<i>america's
next top model.</i>

23:41.505 --> 23:43.903
Yeah. I guess
it's no big deal.

23:43.968 --> 23:47.862
I mean, maybe
this stuff isn't that
important after all.

23:47.938 --> 23:50.600
Yeah, my husband
was really excellent

23:50.666 --> 23:53.033
at forgetting
our anniversary, too.

23:53.107 --> 23:55.532
And it didn't really
matter that much,

23:55.606 --> 23:57.900
or at least that's
what i told myself.

23:57.967 --> 24:00.030
And i would drop hints
all the time,

24:00.105 --> 24:01.961
but it never worked.

24:02.038 --> 24:04.403
And finally one day
i just looked at him
and i said,

24:04.468 --> 24:08.300
charlie,
what the hell is it
about our anniversary?

24:08.365 --> 24:10.731
Why won't you
just remember it and
get it over with?

24:10.805 --> 24:13.831
And he looked
at me and he smiled,

24:13.905 --> 24:15.402
and he said...

24:15.467 --> 24:18.163
'cause
it's just one day.

24:18.238 --> 24:22.733
What's one day
when you compared it...

24:22.805 --> 24:25.901
to being married to you
every single day?

24:29.866 --> 24:31.261
That's a really good answer.

24:31.336 --> 24:34.500
Yeah. That was charlie.

24:42.138 --> 24:43.533
The funeral home.

24:43.606 --> 24:44.531
Sorry?

24:44.608 --> 24:45.732
Your friend.

24:45.806 --> 24:47.733
Why don't you check
with the funeral home

24:47.807 --> 24:49.262
where her husband
had his wake?

24:49.335 --> 24:52.361
What if she moved,
you know, after the wake?

24:52.437 --> 24:54.832
I bet they have
a cell number

24:54.836 --> 24:56.201
or maybe
her work number.

24:56.268 --> 24:57.950
You are a genius.

24:57.958 --> 24:58.531
Right.

24:58.605 --> 25:00.460
Please tell my son that.

25:01.007 --> 25:01.963
Bye.

25:02.038 --> 25:03.663
Bye.

25:19.136 --> 25:21.303
The chens.

25:21.365 --> 25:24.232
I remember the chen family.

25:24.235 --> 25:25.393
Do you remember
the wife?

25:25.395 --> 25:26.433
Lilly?

25:26.496 --> 25:28.431
Just that she seemed so sad.

25:28.498 --> 25:32.260
It was only her and a man,
about her age...

25:32.335 --> 25:35.061
he was just inconsolable.

25:35.138 --> 25:37.361
Cried more than she did,
if i remember.

25:37.436 --> 25:39.493
Must have been jesse,
his partner.

25:39.568 --> 25:40.733
I didn't get the name.

25:40.797 --> 25:42.061
I tried to comfort them,

25:42.138 --> 25:44.861
tried to tell them that
warren was at peace now...

25:44.935 --> 25:48.230
but, of course...

25:48.295 --> 25:49.563
i know.

25:49.637 --> 25:51.390
So sorry
to keep you waiting.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.432
We do still have the records
from that funeral,

25:53.498 --> 25:57.220
but i'm afraid
i couldn't give you any
personal information.

25:57.225 --> 25:58.062
Oh, i understand.

25:58.136 --> 26:01.732
But if i could
impose on you just
a little bit more...

26:01.796 --> 26:03.990
um, would you mind
calling ms. Chen

26:04.067 --> 26:06.192
and just giving her
my phone number,

26:06.268 --> 26:08.863
just let her know
that i have a message
about warren,

26:08.938 --> 26:10.830
and that it's
really important
that i speak to her.

26:10.898 --> 26:11.931
If it's that important...

26:11.995 --> 26:13.832
thanks, i really
appreciate that.

26:13.896 --> 26:16.192
Tell him he did
a fantastic job on the hair

26:16.267 --> 26:17.693
for the woman in room 5.

26:17.765 --> 26:19.331
The family loved it.

26:19.396 --> 26:21.393
So did she.

26:22.838 --> 26:24.730
People really
love your work.

26:36.668 --> 26:38.093
Let's walk.

26:38.166 --> 26:42.132
I have to admit,
i didn't think
you'd call me back.

26:42.195 --> 26:44.163
I'm not sure why i did.

26:44.235 --> 26:46.433
But for some reason
i felt like i had to.

26:47.698 --> 26:49.562
You said you had a message
about warren.

26:50.505 --> 26:51.242
Did you know him?

26:51.245 --> 26:53.060
No, not really. Um...

26:53.138 --> 26:55.460
i've been doing
some research on
the restaurant fire,

26:55.536 --> 26:57.033
the red noir.

26:57.098 --> 26:58.491
You know,
i don't mean to pry,

26:58.506 --> 27:01.393
but do you know
why warren would
do what he did?

27:01.468 --> 27:03.762
It doesn't make sense.

27:03.836 --> 27:05.762
What was he like?

27:05.838 --> 27:08.860
He always said his life
had perfect balance,

27:08.938 --> 27:12.260
except then he got
into business with jesse.

27:12.338 --> 27:13.590
To be his partner.

27:13.668 --> 27:15.591
Yes, and that
was the problem.

27:15.666 --> 27:17.132
He wasn't just
a chef anymore.

27:17.198 --> 27:18.661
He had to deal
with the business...

27:18.735 --> 27:20.793
the hiring, the firing.

27:20.865 --> 27:24.230
He hated it.
Worst of all,

27:24.295 --> 27:26.030
it had nothing
to do with his talent,

27:26.095 --> 27:28.531
what made him happy.

27:28.595 --> 27:30.493
His mood changed.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.332
He was always
so stressed.

27:33.396 --> 27:35.091
Do you think that's
why he set the fire?

27:35.168 --> 27:36.962
So he could
get out of it?

27:37.037 --> 27:38.632
I just don't know.

27:38.698 --> 27:42.632
What if i told you
there was a way you
could ask him?

27:42.695 --> 27:44.923
I don't know what you...

27:44.938 --> 27:48.191
what if i said
that warren's spirit
is still here?

27:50.437 --> 27:54.462
I can help you talk
to him, through me.

27:57.097 --> 27:59.831
No. Lilly, please...

27:59.896 --> 28:01.791
he showed me
a piece of glass.

28:01.867 --> 28:04.260
Stained glass, does that
mean anything to you?

28:06.465 --> 28:07.992
I don't want him to see me.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.792
??????????

28:19.337 --> 28:20.331
Warren?

28:22.498 --> 28:24.231
Warren chen?

28:24.296 --> 28:26.933
I need to talk to you.

28:26.996 --> 28:29.361
I can help you.

28:29.438 --> 28:32.763
I spoke to your wife
and jesse.

28:32.838 --> 28:36.763
They don't really
understand why you
did what you did.

28:36.835 --> 28:37.832
Warren:
What did i do?

28:40.366 --> 28:42.933
Set the restaurant
on fire. Twice.

28:42.995 --> 28:44.162
Don't you remember that?

28:44.237 --> 28:45.661
I remember being mad
at jesse.

28:46.545 --> 28:47.491
Why?

28:47.505 --> 28:48.731
I wanted him to buy me out.

28:48.807 --> 28:50.702
I needed him to buy me out.

28:50.766 --> 28:52.062
He kept telling me
he'd pay me off,

28:52.138 --> 28:53.173
and then he'd always
have an excuse.

28:53.178 --> 28:54.741
He was never going
to give me what was mine.

28:54.808 --> 28:57.270
Did you think you
were going to get money
from the fire?

28:57.346 --> 29:00.240
From the insurance?
Or were you just trying
to get back at jesse?

29:00.256 --> 29:01.270
I don't remember.

29:03.035 --> 29:05.733
You really hate
this place.

29:05.738 --> 29:08.200
I was a chef...

29:08.275 --> 29:09.803
before.

29:09.877 --> 29:11.291
I used to love
to come to work.

29:11.307 --> 29:12.360
I couldn't wait.

29:12.438 --> 29:14.430
People loved what i did.

29:14.508 --> 29:15.492
When i got this place
with jesse,

29:15.505 --> 29:16.560
it all changed.

29:17.105 --> 29:20.330
I used to dream
about fire...

29:21.666 --> 29:24.003
about this place
burning down.

29:25.338 --> 29:26.862
And then i'd be free.

29:31.466 --> 29:32.901
Warren, i know how
much pain you're in,

29:32.967 --> 29:35.003
but you have to cross over.
There's a better place for you.

29:35.006 --> 29:36.503
I can't.

29:39.337 --> 29:42.331
Ok. Look, the revenge
that you wanted to get
on jesse, you got it.

29:42.408 --> 29:43.660
All right? He's ruined.

29:43.736 --> 29:45.362
He's probably
never going to be able

29:45.436 --> 29:46.430
to open a business again.

29:46.508 --> 29:47.830
It's lilly.

29:49.838 --> 29:51.562
There's something
she has to know.

29:51.635 --> 29:52.860
What?

29:56.538 --> 29:58.062
I don't know.

29:58.137 --> 30:00.132
Does it have something to do
with that stained glass?

30:01.366 --> 30:03.533
I love her so much.

30:08.367 --> 30:10.203
I'm afraid i hurt her.

30:12.668 --> 30:14.530
I have to talk to her.

30:18.208 --> 30:20.432
Don't let lilly think
i forgot her.

30:50.407 --> 30:51.600
You know what, noah?

30:51.667 --> 30:54.462
I think i'll see you
back at the station.

30:59.006 --> 31:00.103
Ah!
Sorry...

31:00.165 --> 31:02.030
aah!
It's ok.

31:04.538 --> 31:05.530
You remember me?

31:05.607 --> 31:08.501
Yeah. You threw
my slipper at me.

31:08.568 --> 31:09.932
Tossed.

31:10.006 --> 31:11.490
I tossed it at you.
There's a difference.

31:11.505 --> 31:12.490
Let me see
if i can fix this.

31:12.507 --> 31:13.493
There's a trick to it.

31:13.507 --> 31:14.632
Yeah.

31:16.505 --> 31:17.552
That's not it.

31:17.558 --> 31:20.222
I hope you're better
at putting out fires.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.691
I'll buy you a new one.

31:21.757 --> 31:23.251
Don't worry about it.

31:23.325 --> 31:26.103
I'm jim...
jim clancy,
by the way.

31:26.106 --> 31:26.652
Melinda gordon.

31:26.725 --> 31:27.651
Nice to meet you.

31:27.726 --> 31:28.851
I have to...

31:28.926 --> 31:30.022
where you headed?

31:30.098 --> 31:34.023
Uh... now
to get an umbrella.

31:34.096 --> 31:35.350
Right.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.451
Produce. My apartment
is full of soot, so...

31:38.526 --> 31:40.750
i don't know about you,
but i'm starved.

31:40.828 --> 31:42.120
Well, good luck
with that.

31:42.198 --> 31:45.053
Hey, let me buy you
a late dinner.

31:45.128 --> 31:46.452
I know a place.

31:46.528 --> 31:48.123
What place?

31:50.126 --> 31:51.890
Ever heard
of the umbrella room?

31:51.957 --> 31:53.352
No.

31:53.426 --> 31:54.352
Come on.

31:58.307 --> 31:59.681
?????????

32:00.856 --> 32:02.551
Well, you got class,
i'll give you that.

32:02.628 --> 32:04.652
Anybody can take
you to sardi's.

32:04.727 --> 32:06.052
Thanks, boss.

32:06.128 --> 32:08.252
You won't find
this kind of food there.

32:08.328 --> 32:09.892
One can hope.

32:14.128 --> 32:15.650
Do you live close by?

32:16.727 --> 32:19.723
Well, near.
West 90th.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.293
That's the upper west side.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.993
This is the east village.

32:24.056 --> 32:25.753
That's not close at all.

32:25.826 --> 32:28.353
I was never any good
with a compass.

32:31.025 --> 32:34.691
You got a little, uh...

32:35.928 --> 32:37.253
on your lip.

32:43.558 --> 32:44.791
What?

32:44.857 --> 32:46.321
Nothing.

32:48.016 --> 32:48.792
I know.

32:48.856 --> 32:51.291
You were pretty
sure that guy was
in that apartment.

32:51.357 --> 32:52.822
Lucky guess.

32:52.895 --> 32:54.250
No. You knew.

32:54.328 --> 32:55.392
You were sure.

32:55.456 --> 32:57.023
I've been thinking
about it all night.

32:57.027 --> 32:58.023
How did you know?

32:58.096 --> 32:59.793
You know what?
I have to go home.

32:59.856 --> 33:00.952
I have work in the morning.

33:01.026 --> 33:02.792
You know,
i hate secrets.

33:02.855 --> 33:05.021
So, how did you know?

33:12.898 --> 33:14.820
Maybe someday
i'll tell you.

33:26.356 --> 33:27.823
Earth to melinda.

33:27.897 --> 33:29.091
Sorry.

33:29.157 --> 33:31.221
I was lost in thought.

33:31.296 --> 33:32.621
What about?

33:32.696 --> 33:35.752
Um... about...

33:35.826 --> 33:39.921
about how to get lilly chen
to talk to her husband.

33:39.996 --> 33:43.221
I never got her number
when she met me.

33:43.296 --> 33:44.623
But she called you, right?

33:44.696 --> 33:46.621
So it's probably
in my phone memory.
Hello.

33:46.695 --> 33:49.120
Uh. Here. Look.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.350
This number...
i don't recognize it.

33:51.428 --> 33:53.451
That's got to be it.

33:53.525 --> 33:54.992
So?

33:55.056 --> 33:57.592
I just don't like
doing this kind of thing
over the phone.

33:57.657 --> 34:00.521
You mean you really
don't like the hanging-up-
in-your-face part.

34:00.597 --> 34:02.723
Exactly.

34:02.795 --> 34:03.751
You online?

34:03.828 --> 34:05.091
Yeah...

34:05.158 --> 34:06.090
let me try something.

34:07.797 --> 34:10.351
All right.
This is a reverse
phone directory site.

34:10.427 --> 34:11.790
You put
the phone number in,

34:11.857 --> 34:13.793
you get
an address, unless
it's been blocked.

34:13.856 --> 34:15.021
You never cease to amaze me.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.723
Ditto.

34:25.456 --> 34:26.791
What?

34:26.855 --> 34:30.850
You already
gave me this address.

35:06.506 --> 35:08.333
There was a time
he was like my brother.

35:10.705 --> 35:12.462
I'm so sorry, warren.

35:12.535 --> 35:13.562
And lilly...

35:15.535 --> 35:17.500
she was my wife.

35:17.568 --> 35:19.560
We went through
so much together.

35:19.565 --> 35:21.502
Look, we don't really
know what happened...

35:21.507 --> 35:22.492
or when it happened.

35:22.507 --> 35:23.491
I just died.
How could they...

35:23.507 --> 35:25.230
you died a year ago, warren.

35:25.308 --> 35:27.162
Things change.

35:27.168 --> 35:29.502
People change. Sometimes
they have to move on.

35:29.506 --> 35:30.972
I'm going to burn them.

35:31.038 --> 35:32.233
No.

35:32.306 --> 35:35.003
I will burn everything.

35:47.975 --> 35:49.302
Jesse!

35:49.368 --> 35:50.502
Jesse!

35:52.668 --> 35:54.561
Ow! Jesse!

35:57.065 --> 35:58.030
Hey, what the hell is...

35:58.106 --> 35:59.431
god, it's hot.
Are you all right?

35:59.505 --> 36:01.160
It's just my furnace.
What's wrong with you?

36:01.238 --> 36:03.160
There is nothing wrong
with your furnace.

36:03.237 --> 36:04.433
Ok? Just please
come outside?

36:04.505 --> 36:05.432
Why?

36:05.505 --> 36:06.931
Just please.
Warren's here.

36:07.006 --> 36:08.970
Warren? What are you
talking about?

36:09.037 --> 36:10.602
Warren's spirit
is still here.

36:10.666 --> 36:12.263
Ok? He's been haunting
the restaurant.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.762
He caused the fire.
And he knows about
you and lilly,

36:13.768 --> 36:15.162
and he's really mad...

36:15.237 --> 36:16.162
are you on drugs?

36:16.236 --> 36:18.002
Warren, don't do this!

36:25.838 --> 36:26.700
What the hell?

36:26.707 --> 36:29.463
She says warren's
spirit is still here.

36:29.535 --> 36:30.972
Look, he knows
about you and jesse.

36:31.037 --> 36:32.032
You have to talk to him

36:32.108 --> 36:33.631
before he burns
the house down.

36:34.977 --> 36:35.902
Are you ok?

36:35.977 --> 36:38.733
Aah! Please!

36:38.806 --> 36:41.263
If that's you,
if you're doing this,

36:41.337 --> 36:43.903
please stop!
I'm so sorry!

36:43.976 --> 36:46.181
Tell him how much
you love him.

36:46.186 --> 36:48.432
Use his name.

36:50.465 --> 36:51.763
Warren!

36:51.836 --> 36:54.600
I love you so much!

36:54.667 --> 36:56.903
He's right here...

36:56.976 --> 36:59.332
next to me.

37:03.836 --> 37:05.830
Ask her how long.

37:05.906 --> 37:07.362
How long was she with him?

37:07.435 --> 37:08.870
Before i died?

37:08.935 --> 37:10.062
He wants to know

37:10.067 --> 37:12.460
if you were with jesse
before he died.

37:12.538 --> 37:13.660
No, never...

37:13.738 --> 37:14.870
it wasn't like that.

37:14.935 --> 37:16.232
Warren...

37:16.306 --> 37:18.561
i knew you loved me.

37:21.507 --> 37:25.831
All i wanted was for us
to get our lives back...

37:25.837 --> 37:29.603
i wanted you to quit,
to be happy...

37:29.665 --> 37:32.533
i didn't mean for it
to happen, warren.

37:32.607 --> 37:35.631
I never thought
of jesse that way...

37:35.707 --> 37:38.631
but when you...

37:38.706 --> 37:41.301
when you died...

37:41.365 --> 37:45.002
we were
both so... so lost.

37:46.467 --> 37:48.403
Jesse was destroyed.

37:48.465 --> 37:50.563
He cried for you...

37:50.637 --> 37:54.931
he called your name.
He was so torn up.

37:55.977 --> 37:57.432
Warren: No!

37:57.507 --> 37:59.433
He cried.

38:01.505 --> 38:03.002
Jesse.

38:04.668 --> 38:06.262
Now i remember.

38:06.337 --> 38:08.362
He remembers.

38:11.507 --> 38:15.131
Lilly was making
a stained glass window
for our bedroom.

38:15.207 --> 38:19.060
I saw this beautiful piece
of glass on my lunch hour.

38:19.135 --> 38:21.231
I hadn't bought her a gift
in such a long time.

38:21.307 --> 38:23.432
And i'd had another fight
with jesse about the money.

38:23.505 --> 38:24.930
I left work mad
and was halfway home

38:25.007 --> 38:26.732
when i realized
i forgot the gift.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.661
I went in the back way...

38:38.668 --> 38:40.002
jesse!

38:40.066 --> 38:41.870
What are you doing?

38:47.435 --> 38:48.762
He watched you.

38:48.836 --> 38:52.702
He watched you
set the fire.

38:57.368 --> 38:59.662
Is this true?

39:01.975 --> 39:03.902
Lilly, please.

39:05.335 --> 39:07.731
You have to believe me.
I didn't mean to.

39:13.505 --> 39:15.001
I did it for all of us!

39:15.006 --> 39:16.462
We were going broke!

39:16.535 --> 39:17.500
It wasn't working!

39:17.506 --> 39:19.491
And i thought
if warren found out,

39:19.507 --> 39:20.501
that he'd quit
for sure.

39:21.768 --> 39:24.561
The insurance paid off,
we'd just start over.

39:24.636 --> 39:26.100
Clean slate.

39:26.167 --> 39:27.760
I made one mistake.

39:27.836 --> 39:29.500
He wasn't supposed
to be there.

39:29.566 --> 39:32.063
I don't know why
warren came back.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.100
What the hell
are you doing here?
Get out!

39:38.537 --> 39:40.461
Go on! Go on!
Go back!

39:40.536 --> 39:41.462
I can't!

39:41.537 --> 39:42.460
Why'd you come back here?!

39:42.536 --> 39:43.790
Why did you do this?

39:43.868 --> 39:45.961
Warren, get out of here!
Go on! Come on!

39:46.035 --> 39:49.200
Make a run for it!
No! No, no, not there!

39:49.266 --> 39:50.762
Aah!
Not there!

39:50.838 --> 39:51.833
Aah!
No!

40:00.167 --> 40:03.060
I swear i didn't
mean to hurt him.

40:03.137 --> 40:05.033
Just let him
take the blame.

40:05.106 --> 40:06.933
Yeah, but what
difference did it make?

40:07.005 --> 40:08.861
Nothing could have
brought warren back.

40:08.938 --> 40:11.792
I never said he did it.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.230
The arson
investigators did.

40:17.636 --> 40:18.961
Lilly please...
uhh!

40:19.036 --> 40:20.302
Get away from me!

40:23.795 --> 40:26.243
It wasn't the reopening
that woke you up.

40:26.248 --> 40:29.061
It was lilly and jesse
being together.

40:29.135 --> 40:32.862
You had to tell her that
the man she was living
with killed you.

40:32.935 --> 40:36.763
Please tell her...

40:36.838 --> 40:39.732
i always loved her.

40:39.797 --> 40:43.262
No matter
how hard i worked...

40:44.698 --> 40:47.690
no matter how much it seemed
like i wasn't there.

40:49.168 --> 40:51.463
I did it for her.

40:53.366 --> 40:55.433
I wanted to give us a life.

40:57.638 --> 40:59.561
He wants you to know
that he always loved you.

40:59.637 --> 41:02.261
And he worked so hard

41:02.336 --> 41:04.600
because he wanted
the two of you to have
a good life...

41:04.667 --> 41:06.303
we did have a good life.

41:06.367 --> 41:08.462
You and me
together, warren.

41:08.536 --> 41:11.263
I didn't need
anything else.

41:11.335 --> 41:14.133
How can i be dead...

41:14.206 --> 41:16.530
if this hurts so much?

41:18.505 --> 41:20.401
If i love her so much?

41:20.466 --> 41:22.560
You'll always
love her.

41:22.638 --> 41:26.500
Tell her no matter
what happens...

41:26.567 --> 41:30.561
i'll be waiting for her.

41:32.567 --> 41:35.762
Tell her i'll never
forget her eyes.

41:37.167 --> 41:39.732
I'll see them again,
with mine someday.

41:45.838 --> 41:48.332
He's ready
to cross over now.

42:26.268 --> 42:28.563
Well, are you going
to open it,

42:28.637 --> 42:30.731
or you just going to
wait for your x-ray
vision to kick in?

42:30.797 --> 42:32.162
Come on.
What's the occasion?

42:32.235 --> 42:34.732
There doesn't have
to be an occasion.

42:34.795 --> 42:36.691
I just saw it
and thought of you.

42:36.766 --> 42:38.331
Ok.

42:42.966 --> 42:44.263
Hot dogs!

42:44.338 --> 42:46.261
Whoa!

42:46.336 --> 42:48.601
It works
and everything.

42:48.668 --> 42:50.003
Ha ha! Perfect!

42:50.068 --> 42:51.560
You are a genius.

42:51.638 --> 42:53.560
I love you.
What a surprise.

42:55.666 --> 42:58.132
Um, you know,
i don't want you
to be late for the guys.

42:58.205 --> 42:59.341
So, you should
get going.

42:59.356 --> 43:01.261
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hey, you know what?
Could you do me a favor?

43:01.335 --> 43:03.461
Grab my jacket
out of the closet. I'm
just gonna plug this in.

43:03.535 --> 43:04.891
I just want to see if
it works once, you know?

43:04.907 --> 43:06.631
I'll get an extension cord.
Sure.

43:06.696 --> 43:08.131
Sometimes these things
are a little temperamental.

43:08.208 --> 43:09.261
Right.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.301
The fuse might not
hook in just right.

43:11.367 --> 43:14.200
I'll get your jacket.

43:36.168 --> 43:38.002
There's a trick to it.

43:41.207 --> 43:43.401
Dinner at the umbrella room?

43:51.506 --> 43:54.161
I'd thought
you'd forgotten.

43:54.237 --> 43:56.033
Never.

44:06.536 --> 44:09.132
I'd thought
you'd forgotten.
