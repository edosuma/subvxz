01:43.157 --> 01:45.459
Morning, Mr. Thrombey.

01:58.828 --> 02:01.405
Mr. Thrombey, you up there?

02:01.792 --> 02:04.082
Mr. Thrombey, I'm coming in.

02:14.794 --> 02:16.156
Shit!

02:36.888 --> 02:40.228
<i>You killed him! You bastard!
You murdered him!</i>

02:40.228 --> 02:41.702
<i>I didn't murder nobody.</i>

02:41.702 --> 02:45.545
<i>You slashed his face open and you left him
bleeding in the street, like a stuffed pig.</i>

02:45.545 --> 02:50.223
<i>Then you crushed his skull with a forklift
and burnt his hands off to erase the fingerprints.</i>

02:50.223 --> 02:51.347
<i>You'll never prove it.</i>

02:51.347 --> 02:53.530
<i>We have the nanny cam footage!</i>

02:53.530 --> 02:55.643
Alice, turn that off now, please.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.711
Why? It's almost over.

02:56.711 --> 02:57.850
Now, please. Just turn that off.

02:57.850 --> 02:59.842
They're finding out who did it,
and the WiFi sucks in my room...

02:59.842 --> 03:02.743
Turn it off now! Alice! Off!

03:02.743 --> 03:05.049
There isn't even anything bad on it,
it's just normal TV...

03:05.049 --> 03:07.364
They're talking murder on it!

03:07.364 --> 03:10.943
Your sister just had a friend
she loves slit his throat open,

03:10.943 --> 03:12.955
and she doesn't need
to be hearing that right now!

03:12.955 --> 03:14.919
Let's be sensitive!

03:19.029 --> 03:21.062
Alice, you can keep watching
your show, it's fine.

03:21.062 --> 03:23.006
No, I guessed who did it anyway.

03:23.006 --> 03:25.701
- I'm sorry Marta.
- It's okay.

03:27.447 --> 03:29.211
It's Harlan's son.

03:32.330 --> 03:33.422
Hi, Walt.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.280
Hi, Martha. It's Walt.

03:35.454 --> 03:37.260
Would you mind
coming to the house early?

03:37.260 --> 03:40.549
The police have
a few more questions for everybody.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.456
What?

04:01.734 --> 04:04.974
Hey! Excuse me ma'am.
You with the help?

04:04.974 --> 04:07.665
Hey! Her name is Marta.
She was granddad's nurse.

04:07.665 --> 04:10.061
She's with us. "The help?"

04:10.634 --> 04:12.481
It's okay. I'm sorry.

04:12.545 --> 04:15.159
No. It's not okay.
What the hell?

04:24.693 --> 04:26.220
How are you doing?

04:27.830 --> 04:30.586
Not very good. Alone.

04:31.282 --> 04:35.487
Lots of days,
and not knowing what to do next.

04:35.836 --> 04:38.812
Martha, anything you need.

04:39.574 --> 04:41.607
You're part of this family.

04:43.104 --> 04:44.112
Thank you.

04:45.956 --> 04:48.302
- How are you doing kiddo?
- Linda.

04:49.072 --> 04:50.578
How are you?

04:52.384 --> 04:55.927
You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.

04:56.227 --> 04:59.022
I thought you should've been there.
I was out voted.

04:59.022 --> 05:01.121
Get arrested.
Die up your own ass for all I care!

05:01.121 --> 05:02.765
Richard.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.597
He's not coming.

05:05.367 --> 05:08.611
Ransom. Little shit.
Missed the funeral.

05:08.991 --> 05:10.389
Excuse me.

05:10.824 --> 05:13.540
We're ready for you now.
We'd like to see you one at a time.

05:13.540 --> 05:15.775
All right. I'll go first.

05:15.775 --> 05:19.963
I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up
before the memorial tonight.

05:20.243 --> 05:21.973
We'll do our best, ma'am.

05:24.309 --> 05:27.211
So, how are you doing kiddo?

05:28.543 --> 05:31.115
We're just gonna reintroduce
ourselves as a formality.

05:31.115 --> 05:34.610
I am Detective Lieutenant Elliott,
and this is Trooper Wagner.

05:34.761 --> 05:39.844
Now, I'm going to record,
this just to make things easier.

05:40.127 --> 05:42.378
All right, we're with Linda Drysdale,
nee Thrombey,

05:42.884 --> 05:44.754
Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter,

05:45.723 --> 05:48.113
in discussing the events
that took place the night of his demise,

05:48.113 --> 05:50.502
one week ago, November 8th.

05:50.502 --> 05:52.728
We're very sorry for your loss.

05:53.860 --> 05:56.473
Thank you. That means a lot.

05:56.679 --> 05:59.800
So, we understand at that night
the family had gathered

05:59.800 --> 06:01.930
to celebrate
your father's 85th birthday.

06:01.930 --> 06:03.182
Yes.

06:03.182 --> 06:04.394
How was it?

06:04.785 --> 06:07.288
The party? Pre my dad's death?

06:08.104 --> 06:09.619
It was great.

06:10.076 --> 06:12.561
Did anyone besides the family
show face?

06:13.196 --> 06:14.935
Fran, the housekeeper.

06:14.935 --> 06:18.267
He was a nice guy,
but he was so hairy.

06:18.267 --> 06:21.098
And I dated Italian guys,
you know what I mean.

06:22.017 --> 06:26.306
Marta, Harlan's caregiver,
good girl, hard worker.

06:26.596 --> 06:28.486
Family's from Ecuador.

06:28.946 --> 06:32.840
And Wanetta - Greatnana,
Harlan's mom.

06:32.840 --> 06:33.875
Hi Nana.

06:33.875 --> 06:37.144
His mom? How old is she?

06:37.768 --> 06:39.219
We have no idea.

06:39.523 --> 06:42.988
Okay, and your son Ransom,
did he attend as well?

06:43.112 --> 06:44.874
Yes, but he left early.

06:45.548 --> 06:48.741
Ransom, are you leaving?

06:54.320 --> 06:58.638
Right, would you say that all three of you
showed up around the same time?

06:59.711 --> 07:01.077
No.

07:02.731 --> 07:06.173
Richard came early
to help the caterers set up.

07:06.373 --> 07:10.294
Okay, and you and your husband Richard
work at a real estate firm in Boston?

07:10.294 --> 07:12.188
No, it's my company.

07:12.188 --> 07:13.742
Right, right. Sorry.

07:13.742 --> 07:15.724
I built my business
from the ground up.

07:16.034 --> 07:18.958
Just like your father.
You two were very close?

07:20.456 --> 07:23.669
We had our own secret way
of communicating.

07:23.794 --> 07:26.647
You had to find that with dad.

07:26.818 --> 07:28.693
You had to find a game
to play with him.

07:28.841 --> 07:32.703
And if you did that,
and you played by his rules...

07:38.122 --> 07:40.852
Everyone idolizes their dad, right?

07:40.974 --> 07:42.745
I don't know, do they?

07:43.789 --> 07:47.098
Very much not,
don't know why I said that.

07:47.871 --> 07:49.804
But my wife, Linda, does.

07:49.804 --> 07:52.212
Harlan started out
with a rusty Smith-Corona,

07:52.212 --> 07:56.614
and built himself into one of the bestselling
mystery writers of all time.

07:56.614 --> 08:01.003
Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.

08:02.812 --> 08:04.287
Sure.

08:04.436 --> 08:08.983
For the record, I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey,
Harlan Thrombey's youngest son.

08:08.983 --> 08:11.481
So, you run
your father's publishing company?

08:11.481 --> 08:12.331
Yeah.

08:12.331 --> 08:14.168
It's my - it's our...

08:14.330 --> 08:17.564
It's the family's publishing company,
dad trusts me to run it.

08:18.561 --> 08:23.819
30 languages, over 80 million
copies sold. A real legacy.

08:24.654 --> 08:25.745
You guys fans?

08:25.745 --> 08:28.116
I mean, I don't do
much fiction reading myself.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.622
Big fan. I'm big fan.
I mean...

08:30.622 --> 08:33.201
His plots are just like...
I got one spoiler for you,

08:33.201 --> 08:36.673
But, okay, like "A Thousand Knives",
the cow and the shotgun,

08:36.673 --> 08:39.096
like, where do you
come up with that?

08:39.316 --> 08:42.585
Dad said the plots just popped into
his head fully formed.

08:42.585 --> 08:44.476
It was the easy part for him.

08:46.863 --> 08:48.489
So, you're in the area, right?

08:48.489 --> 08:51.034
You guys probably arrived
around the same time?

08:52.863 --> 08:54.723
We all got here around 8.

08:55.191 --> 08:57.369
My wife Donna, she's my rock.

08:59.301 --> 09:01.451
Jesus! Donna. Are you all right?

09:01.911 --> 09:07.450
My son Jacob, he's 16.
Very politically active.

09:07.450 --> 09:09.150
The boy is literally a Nazi.

09:09.150 --> 09:11.239
He's an alt-right troll dipshit.

09:11.556 --> 09:14.076
Kids today, with the internet.
It's amazing.

09:15.179 --> 09:16.649
So, the night went well?

09:18.701 --> 09:22.768
I mean, we're all gutted, but I was happy
to have that night with him.

09:22.768 --> 09:27.464
To be by his side, to think about our books
and what we've accomplished with them.

09:27.956 --> 09:30.925
It's like I can still feel
his hand on my shoulder.

09:32.317 --> 09:33.947
Passing the torch.

09:33.947 --> 09:38.582
So, we're here with Joni Thrombey,
Harlan Thrombey's daughter in law?

09:39.220 --> 09:43.131
Yeah, I married his son Neil.
We had one daughter, Meg.

09:43.409 --> 09:47.022
And then Neil passed on,
15 years ago.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.371
And you remained close
to the Thrombeys.

09:49.371 --> 09:51.497
Oh, they're my family.

09:54.921 --> 09:57.381
I feel simultaneously freed by

09:58.796 --> 10:01.240
and supported by them.

10:04.848 --> 10:08.000
It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.217
Sorry, the Nugget of...?

10:10.217 --> 10:11.523
Flam.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.674
Yeah, Flam, your skin care
company. Sorry.

10:14.841 --> 10:16.410
I forgive you.

10:16.887 --> 10:19.971
Yeah, it's skin care,
but it promotes a total lifestyle.

10:19.971 --> 10:23.879
Self sufficiency with an acknowledgment
of human need.

10:23.879 --> 10:26.903
That's Flam, but it's also Harlan.

10:27.041 --> 10:29.427
He got me and Meg
through some tough times.

10:29.687 --> 10:31.354
Granddad gives my mom
a yearly allowance,

10:31.354 --> 10:34.954
and he's never missed
wiring a tuition payment to my schools.

10:36.573 --> 10:39.239
He's a genuinely selfless man.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.791
But, you left his party early?

10:41.791 --> 10:42.729
Have fun.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.157
To see some friends at Smith.

10:44.157 --> 10:47.873
You know, Dad pays
for her crypto-Marxist

10:47.873 --> 10:52.469
postdeconstructual feminist
poetry theory whatever major.

10:53.159 --> 10:55.249
She could've stuck around
for the cake.

10:55.345 --> 10:57.395
I think Linda was upset.

11:00.809 --> 11:02.667
But Harlan understood.

11:06.768 --> 11:07.930
Right.

11:08.448 --> 11:11.483
You two showed up to the party
around the same time?

11:11.483 --> 11:14.773
If I could pause.
Because I just...

11:15.700 --> 11:18.702
Who is that guy?
And why are we doing all this? Again?

11:18.702 --> 11:20.385
This is just follow up questions,

11:20.585 --> 11:23.698
We're tending to be thorough,
so we can figure out the manner of death.

11:24.038 --> 11:26.645
So by "manner of death"
you mean if someone killed him?

11:26.645 --> 11:29.673
If one of us killed him.
One of his family.

11:29.673 --> 11:30.924
- No, Walt.
- killed him.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.671
Is that what
you're suggesting, Lieutenant?

11:32.671 --> 11:35.377
No one is saying that, okay?
This is all pro forma.

11:35.792 --> 11:36.920
Okay.

11:37.742 --> 11:39.453
So, who the fuck is that?

11:41.410 --> 11:43.119
This is Benoit Blanc.

11:43.687 --> 11:45.422
Benoit Blanc?

11:45.422 --> 11:49.584
Yes. Mr. Blanc is a private investigator
of great renown.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.713
Wait a minute.

11:50.889 --> 11:54.170
I read a tweet
about a New Yorker article about you.

11:54.170 --> 11:56.292
The last of the gentlemen sleuths?

11:56.292 --> 11:59.001
You solved that case
with the tennis champ.

11:59.861 --> 12:01.710
You're famous!

12:02.205 --> 12:05.696
Mr. Blanc is not with the police department,
and not officially involved in the case,

12:05.696 --> 12:07.300
but he's offered to consult.

12:07.762 --> 12:09.820
I happily obliged
and I can vouch for him.

12:09.820 --> 12:11.900
Mr. Blanc, I know who you are.

12:11.900 --> 12:15.340
I read your profile in the New Yorker.
I found it delightful.

12:16.039 --> 12:20.685
I just buried my 85 year old father,
who committed suicide.

12:21.005 --> 12:22.749
Why are you here?

12:24.446 --> 12:27.363
I'm here at the behest of a client.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.213
Who?

12:30.280 --> 12:33.867
I cannot say,
but let me assure you this:

12:34.369 --> 12:37.475
my presence will be ornamental.

12:37.828 --> 12:43.391
You will find me a respectful,
quiet, passive observer

12:44.522 --> 12:46.044
of the truth.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.873
Fine. Are we getting there?

12:50.226 --> 12:52.590
Nearly. Harlan's nurse.

12:52.590 --> 12:55.537
She was at the party
in a professional capacity?

12:55.537 --> 12:56.931
Marta?

12:57.662 --> 12:58.789
I guess.

12:59.098 --> 13:02.788
Harlan hired her to be around to take care
of whatever medical needs popped up.

13:03.455 --> 13:06.431
But really she's
like part of the family.

13:06.709 --> 13:09.527
Good kid.
Been a good friend to Harlan.

13:09.888 --> 13:14.003
Family's from Paraguay.
Linda really likes her work ethic.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.221
"Immigrants - we get the job done."

13:21.699 --> 13:23.836
- From Hamilton.
- Oh Hamilton!

13:24.203 --> 13:25.253
It's so good.

13:25.253 --> 13:26.923
I saw it at the public.

13:29.124 --> 13:30.417
May I just...

13:31.305 --> 13:32.741
Then, I'll recede, but...

13:33.587 --> 13:35.874
As a self-made man myself,

13:36.658 --> 13:41.902
I have to express my admiration
for how you've followed in your father's footsteps.

13:43.213 --> 13:43.985
Thank you.

13:43.985 --> 13:47.642
Just marvelous, you know.
The whole family too.

13:47.785 --> 13:52.135
Joni with her thing,
Walt with his publishing empire.

13:54.339 --> 13:55.587
Well.

13:56.746 --> 14:01.981
Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well
with what dad gave him.

14:02.141 --> 14:05.479
Not that it matters, but
really, Dad hands him a book

14:05.479 --> 14:08.256
twice a year, and Walt publishes it.

14:09.714 --> 14:10.636
it's just not the same.

14:10.636 --> 14:16.596
But, surely, Walt runs the merchandising,
adaptations, film and television rights...

14:17.096 --> 14:19.227
Are you baiting me, Detective?

14:20.214 --> 14:21.793
You know he doesn't.

14:22.287 --> 14:24.343
And you think I am dumb enough

14:24.343 --> 14:27.661
to be baited into talking
family business,

14:27.661 --> 14:32.990
into shit talking my baby brother in front of a
police detective and a state trooper...

14:33.153 --> 14:35.215
Walt doesn't run shit!

14:35.450 --> 14:37.893
Because there are no
TV and film rights.

14:38.284 --> 14:41.162
Harlan's never allowed
any adaptations of his books.

14:41.321 --> 14:43.352
- Hated the idea.
- No!

14:43.708 --> 14:46.250
Yeah! Drives Walt nuts.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.458
'Cause that's where the real money is.

14:48.907 --> 14:52.813
Walt would get a little Irish courage in him,
he'd get into it with Harlan.

14:53.102 --> 14:55.656
Did he get "into it" at the party?

14:56.006 --> 14:57.332
Oh my God!

14:57.332 --> 14:58.316
Come one, Dad!

14:58.316 --> 15:02.316
He wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy.
Harlan finally had to give him the hook.

15:03.452 --> 15:07.230
I didn't hear what he said,
but he must've really handed him his lunch.

15:07.408 --> 15:10.900
'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy
the rest of the night.

15:11.106 --> 15:14.612
What? Richard said what?
No, Jesus, we did not get "into it."

15:14.612 --> 15:17.489
I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.

15:18.355 --> 15:23.032
Harlan took you aside at the party,
when you returned you were chastened.

15:26.377 --> 15:27.943
What did Harlan say to you?

15:29.889 --> 15:32.897
The Netflix guys, their business affairs guy,
he sent something over,

15:32.897 --> 15:35.755
it's hard numbers this time,
and I just think this is a window,

15:36.080 --> 15:38.563
that's not gonna stay open,
we need to take advantage of it,

15:38.563 --> 15:40.533
but then you just need
to look at the numbers.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.384
- Walt.
- Dad!

15:43.172 --> 15:48.188
You put me in charge of our books,
let me be in charge, let me do this! Please.

15:48.223 --> 15:52.066
They're not our books, son.
They're my books.

15:53.007 --> 15:56.033
And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.324
But you're right,
you're right, it's...

15:58.622 --> 16:02.158
It's unfair of me to keep you tethered

16:02.514 --> 16:05.187
to something that isn't yours to control.

16:05.187 --> 16:06.528
What?

16:07.004 --> 16:10.137
I've done you a grave disservice.

16:11.119 --> 16:14.313
All these years I have kept you from

16:14.313 --> 16:18.102
building something of your own,
that was yours.

16:19.948 --> 16:25.014
But you're not going to be running
the publishing house anymore.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.128
You're free of it.

16:30.451 --> 16:32.256
Dad, are you firing me?

16:34.459 --> 16:36.365
We'll talk about details tomorrow.

16:37.065 --> 16:41.038
My mind's made up. Good boy.

16:49.187 --> 16:52.878
We talked, we had a business discussion
about e-books.

16:53.957 --> 16:56.081
Jesus, it was nothing.

16:57.104 --> 17:00.206
You wanna talk about an argument,
hell, Ransom had an argument with him.

17:00.206 --> 17:03.192
Ransom, that's Richard and Linda's son?

17:04.406 --> 17:07.126
Look, we all love Ransom,
he's a good kid, we love him.

17:09.685 --> 17:10.962
But?

17:10.962 --> 17:13.262
But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.

17:14.878 --> 17:17.708
I'm not trying to... I like to keep
stuff like this in the family,

17:17.708 --> 17:20.773
but with Ransom,
he's never had a job.

17:20.948 --> 17:25.042
And dad for some unknown reason
always supported him.

17:25.181 --> 17:28.615
They have this love hate bond.
They fight.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.050
But that night, God,
they had a blow out.

17:32.613 --> 17:33.698
About what?

17:33.698 --> 17:35.698
Are you, goddamn, insane?

17:35.711 --> 17:38.302
We couldn't make it out really,
but it was huge.

17:38.881 --> 17:41.952
And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.

17:42.094 --> 17:46.012
Usually, they like to stoke up drama
in front of the whole family.

17:46.419 --> 17:48.248
Speaking of getting into it.

17:49.251 --> 17:52.743
You were at the house early
to help the caterer set up.

17:53.678 --> 17:56.836
Did you converse
with Harlan at that time?

17:57.864 --> 17:59.749
Well, he was there,
we must have spoke.

18:00.008 --> 18:01.424
In his study?

18:03.260 --> 18:04.729
I don't think so.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.917
You see, I spoke with the caterer
this morning.

18:08.009 --> 18:10.831
She didn't see you
helping her staff,

18:10.831 --> 18:16.279
She did hear Harlan in a screaming match
with someone that afternoon in his study.

18:17.091 --> 18:19.682
I don't... A screaming match?

18:20.952 --> 18:21.976
No.

18:23.416 --> 18:26.419
But Joni was here too, she was early.

18:26.419 --> 18:28.782
So, it might have been her,
maybe ask her.

18:28.782 --> 18:30.629
These were two male voices.

18:30.905 --> 18:32.775
Harlan shouted the phrase.

18:32.775 --> 18:35.115
You tell her or I will!

18:35.632 --> 18:39.605
"You tell her or I will."

18:41.345 --> 18:42.893
Bells ringing?

18:51.568 --> 18:54.179
That's none of your business.
You stay out of my marriage!

18:54.179 --> 18:57.415
I know my daughter.
And she would want to know.

18:57.415 --> 19:01.525
I've put it all of it in this letter to her.
Tomorrow she gets it.

19:01.525 --> 19:05.247
Harlan, I'm warning you.
You stay out of my marriage!

19:05.247 --> 19:07.193
She deserves to know
and you gonna tell her.

19:07.193 --> 19:10.240
- The hell I am.
- You tell her or I will!

19:12.919 --> 19:15.040
Yes. I know.

19:16.705 --> 19:17.985
Yes.

19:20.476 --> 19:25.468
Harlan finally decided to put his mom
in a nursing home.

19:25.647 --> 19:27.442
Linda'd always opposed that.

19:27.524 --> 19:31.297
And I wanted to wait
until we got back from Boston to tell Linda.

19:32.030 --> 19:33.723
To avoid the whole scene.

19:33.723 --> 19:36.893
And Harlan wanted me
to tell her then.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.022
That was it.

19:39.754 --> 19:41.715
Sorry. Forgot.

19:42.521 --> 19:43.879
The house?

19:44.367 --> 19:47.162
Early. Richard said you were there.

19:47.610 --> 19:49.731
I was. At the house early.

19:50.775 --> 19:52.242
To see Harlan?

19:53.397 --> 19:55.824
To see Harlan. Yes.

19:57.425 --> 19:59.445
What were you seeing Harlan about?

20:00.226 --> 20:04.569
It was just a mix up
with the payment for Meg's tuition.

20:06.156 --> 20:10.685
I'm sorry to press,
what kind of mix up?

20:12.652 --> 20:16.018
The school hasn't got the check yet,
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it.

20:16.018 --> 20:20.072
Well, Alan didn't mail it
because he caught a discrepancy.

20:21.135 --> 20:26.524
Alan's office has been wiring tuition
directly to the school, as per your request.

20:26.683 --> 20:30.096
But Phyllis's office,
that handles your yearly allowance,

20:30.096 --> 20:34.021
has been wiring the tuition money
directly to you as well.

20:35.087 --> 20:39.086
You have been double dipping Meg's tuition,
and stealing from me.

20:39.659 --> 20:43.864
100 thousand dollars a year.
For the past four years.

20:43.864 --> 20:46.257
Harlan, I don't know how this mix up
happened, but...

20:46.257 --> 20:49.337
So, now I am writing this tuition check,

20:49.494 --> 20:55.446
but you must know that this is
the last money you or Meg will get from me.

20:55.644 --> 20:56.997
Please, you don't understand.

20:56.997 --> 21:00.698
Joni, I know it'll hurt,
but it's all for the best.

21:02.224 --> 21:04.150
My mind's made up.

21:06.553 --> 21:10.499
It was a money wiring issue
with the office at the school.

21:10.629 --> 21:14.115
So, I had to ask Harlan
to cut a check for this semester.

21:14.284 --> 21:15.642
No big deal.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.634
Why don't we just take
a little break and we'll resume...

21:21.819 --> 21:23.849
She's gone.

21:30.746 --> 21:32.242
Richard.

21:33.398 --> 21:34.868
Joni. Have you seen Richard?

21:34.868 --> 21:36.373
No, I was just in with the...

21:36.373 --> 21:37.964
Okay, thanks.

21:39.336 --> 21:40.668
No.

21:41.127 --> 21:42.781
Goddammit! Richard!

21:44.871 --> 21:46.340
Richard.

22:15.471 --> 22:17.453
Son of a bitch!

22:27.821 --> 22:30.582
I might be a victim
of my own expectations here.

22:30.582 --> 22:33.666
But when the great Benoit Blanc
comes knocking at my door

22:34.423 --> 22:40.062
I expect it's going to be about something,
if not extraordinary, then at least interesting.

22:41.103 --> 22:44.330
I'm sorry, this is an
open and shut case of suicide and...

22:44.808 --> 22:47.914
Quite frankly, Benny, we're getting to the point
where I need to know what we're doing here.

22:47.914 --> 22:49.519
The method.

22:50.604 --> 22:52.121
Throat slit.

22:52.701 --> 22:54.720
Typical for a suicide?

22:54.720 --> 22:57.377
I mean, that's dramatic. But look around.

22:58.540 --> 23:01.162
I mean, the guy practically lives
in a clue board.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.564
You told me
to invite all of these people back

23:12.913 --> 23:15.687
for questioning all over again.
I don't get it.

23:21.468 --> 23:25.936
This is a pleasant family with the usual quarrels,
but no possible motives for murder.

23:26.235 --> 23:27.914
Where are you going?

23:32.071 --> 23:34.678
Harlan Thrombey's nurse, Marta...

23:35.186 --> 23:36.951
- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera.

23:36.951 --> 23:38.825
Miss Cabrera, you can just wait inside
and we'll be...

23:38.825 --> 23:40.285
Miss Cabrera.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.113
I've been doing a little poking.

23:45.755 --> 23:49.405
You are hired on a part time basis
as a registered nurse, yes?

23:49.589 --> 23:53.666
Yes, I don't work for a VNA.
Harlan hired me directly.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.141
Take a seat, please.

23:55.834 --> 24:01.044
And you're paid a flat rate
for how many hours a week?

24:02.569 --> 24:05.368
Well, I started at 15, and then he...

24:06.495 --> 24:08.888
- He needed more help.
- Medical help?

24:11.789 --> 24:13.401
He needed a friend.

24:15.641 --> 24:19.780
Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?

24:20.193 --> 24:22.285
All right, Blanc, I mean.
This is...

24:22.285 --> 24:26.325
Marta, we were just discussing
possible motives in the family.

24:26.632 --> 24:31.446
I suspect that Harlan has told you
much unfiltered truth about each of them.

24:31.446 --> 24:34.185
And a little bird has told me,

24:34.734 --> 24:37.038
how should I put this delicately?

24:38.105 --> 24:43.831
You have a regurgitive reaction
to mistruthin'.

24:45.159 --> 24:46.442
Who told you that?

24:46.442 --> 24:48.134
Is it true?

24:50.460 --> 24:51.873
Yes.

24:52.036 --> 24:54.304
It's something I had
since I was a kid.

24:54.304 --> 24:56.494
It's a physically thing that I...

24:56.832 --> 25:00.747
Just the thought of lying,
yeah, it makes me puke.

25:01.013 --> 25:02.427
Really?

25:06.366 --> 25:08.600
Is Richard having an affair?

25:12.931 --> 25:18.686
Why do men instinctively
pull at loose threads on their parachutes?

25:19.406 --> 25:20.732
What?

25:28.297 --> 25:29.710
Richard?

25:31.296 --> 25:33.039
An affair?

25:33.897 --> 25:36.244
<i>A yes or no will do.</i>

25:39.130 --> 25:40.725
No.

25:44.309 --> 25:45.699
Oh shit!

25:46.010 --> 25:49.571
Dear girl I'm sorry. I assumed you
were speaking figuratively.

25:50.775 --> 25:53.466
Here, here. Just take a sip of this.

25:53.466 --> 25:55.707
Take that. Quite something.

25:56.872 --> 25:58.774
But I was obviously right.

25:59.440 --> 26:03.005
Richard is having an affair, his father-in-law
found out and confronted him.

26:03.055 --> 26:04.432
"You tell her or I will."

26:04.432 --> 26:06.275
Okay, but even if that was a case...

26:06.571 --> 26:08.058
- You all right?
- Yeah.

26:08.058 --> 26:09.545
Even if that was a case, I mean,

26:09.545 --> 26:12.590
protecting a relationship as a motive,
that's weak sauce, you know that.

26:12.590 --> 26:14.864
Well. And then there is Joni.

26:15.166 --> 26:17.566
Joni? Lifestyle guru Joni?

26:17.566 --> 26:20.328
No. Harlan was supporting her and her daughter,
and that's the opposite of a motive.

26:20.328 --> 26:23.259
And if that support was threatened?
Miss Cabrera one moment please.

26:23.259 --> 26:24.752
Yes, I just wanna
get some Scope.

26:24.752 --> 26:26.085
Miss Cabrera.

26:27.133 --> 26:30.992
Was Harlan planning on
cutting off Joni's allowance?

26:33.260 --> 26:35.153
Oh, Joni.

26:36.461 --> 26:37.838
What's up?

26:40.857 --> 26:41.912
Oh my God.

26:42.088 --> 26:43.639
Don't answer that
if you're gonna puke again.

26:43.639 --> 26:48.173
Meg said he paid the school directly,
Joni said he sends the money to her.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.816
Both were true.

26:50.162 --> 26:55.469
She was pocketing the double payment.
Harlan found out and cut her off without a cent. Yes?

26:56.054 --> 26:59.086
So she bumps him off
for the inheritance?

26:59.138 --> 27:02.225
Come on! No. Have you seen
her insta? She's an influencer.

27:02.225 --> 27:05.455
No. Allowance as a motive?
Again, more weak sauce.

27:05.678 --> 27:07.432
You're just dumping that bag
of weak sauce on it.

27:07.432 --> 27:09.653
Granted. But she lied to me.

27:10.312 --> 27:11.885
All three of them did.

27:11.885 --> 27:12.964
Three?

27:14.486 --> 27:15.654
Walter.

27:16.638 --> 27:17.876
I see where you are going with this.

27:17.876 --> 27:20.614
Harlan had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights.

27:20.614 --> 27:23.525
But that night something Harlan said
shook him.

27:23.525 --> 27:26.995
Now, we look at the pattern.
Harlan was cleaning house.

27:28.103 --> 27:29.421
I wonder...

27:29.831 --> 27:31.905
Did he plan to fire Walter?

27:31.905 --> 27:34.186
Can I wait inside?
I feel like I shouldn't be here.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.685
Yeah, please just wait inside,
stay close, all right?

27:41.559 --> 27:43.583
You have been very patient my friend.

27:44.593 --> 27:47.245
And yes. You are right.

27:47.245 --> 27:51.477
None of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles answer your question:

27:51.477 --> 27:53.873
Why is Benoit Blanc here?

27:54.817 --> 27:56.939
Well, now I will tell you why.

27:57.846 --> 28:02.985
I'm here because this morning
someone dodged a very important question.

28:03.653 --> 28:04.842
Who?

28:05.380 --> 28:08.739
Me. Linda asked who hired me.

28:10.107 --> 28:11.420
Who hired you?

28:11.614 --> 28:13.440
I do not know.

28:14.194 --> 28:16.952
An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday,

28:16.952 --> 28:19.291
with the news,
clipping of Thrombey's death.

28:19.291 --> 28:20.958
An envelope? That worked?

28:22.621 --> 28:24.413
An envelope of cash.

28:25.455 --> 28:28.076
So, somebody suspects foul play,

28:28.076 --> 28:32.670
and goes through this ha cha dance
of hiring me, of staying anonymous.

28:33.385 --> 28:36.136
It makes no damn sense.

28:37.598 --> 28:39.387
Compels me though.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.108
Walk me through everyone's
whereabouts at the time of death.

28:45.350 --> 28:48.373
We know that the party
ended around 11:30.

28:48.816 --> 28:49.689
Goodnight, Joni.

28:49.689 --> 28:52.347
Marta took Harlan upstairs
to give him his meds.

28:54.312 --> 28:59.076
The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom
and his attic office creak horribly.

28:59.621 --> 29:01.555
And Linda is a light sleeper.

29:01.555 --> 29:04.314
So we know every time someone
took the stairs that night.

29:07.428 --> 29:11.825
The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk
from somewhere above her in the house.

29:21.082 --> 29:24.545
She's concerned about Harlan,
so she goes up to investigate,

29:25.865 --> 29:27.478
waking Linda.

29:28.028 --> 29:30.026
Harlan was in his attic office with Marta.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.962
- Hi, Joni.
- I just ... Hi.

29:31.962 --> 29:33.908
He explained that they
had just knocked over the GO board.

29:33.908 --> 29:35.507
I just knocked over the GO board.

29:35.507 --> 29:39.463
That game with the grid and stones,
they play it every night, and he was fine.

29:39.463 --> 29:41.671
- Go to bed.
- Go to bed, Joni.

29:41.776 --> 29:42.989
- Love you.
- Love you.

29:42.989 --> 29:44.365
So she did.

29:45.736 --> 29:49.140
Ten minutes later,
Linda is awoken a second time

29:51.112 --> 29:52.256
by Marta leaving.

29:52.256 --> 29:53.809
Walt, I'm leaving!

29:54.329 --> 29:56.763
Walt was smoking a cigar
on the porch with his son.

29:56.763 --> 29:59.010
He saw her leave and drive off.

30:00.077 --> 30:02.468
Noted the time - midnight.

30:09.163 --> 30:13.520
Fifteen minutes later, Linda is awoken
for the third and final time

30:15.793 --> 30:17.877
by someone coming down the stairs.

30:17.877 --> 30:20.255
Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.

30:20.404 --> 30:21.910
Dad, go to bed!

30:22.088 --> 30:24.185
Which Walt tried to discourage.

30:24.992 --> 30:30.997
Based on this, the medical examiner determined
the time of death to be between 12:15 and 2 AM.

30:30.997 --> 30:34.842
As Walt was finishing his cigar,
about 12:30, Meg came home.

30:34.989 --> 30:38.907
She went straight to bed.
Walt and Jacob turned in shortly after that.

30:41.224 --> 30:46.026
Sometime later that night,
it's undetermined, but possibly near 3 AM,

30:46.447 --> 30:49.370
Meg woke up because the dogs
were barking outside.

30:49.370 --> 30:52.154
She used the bathroom,
went back to bed.

30:52.608 --> 30:54.383
That's it, all right?

30:54.383 --> 30:58.085
Everyone's stories matched,
every moment accounted for.

30:59.167 --> 31:02.482
And there is no other staircase
up to Harlan's room?

31:02.496 --> 31:04.366
None. Just the creaky one.

31:04.366 --> 31:05.559
Interesting.

31:05.559 --> 31:09.621
So, we know that Ransom didn't do it
because he wasn't there.

31:09.766 --> 31:13.333
Marta couldn't have.
Harlan was still alive when she left.

31:13.510 --> 31:17.279
Meg? Meg came home during the window
of the time of death.

31:17.279 --> 31:21.734
Except it was a suicide, all right?
Harlan slit right through his carotid.

31:21.734 --> 31:24.871
We saw from the blood splat patterns
that they were uninterrupted,

31:24.871 --> 31:28.569
meaning, It's almost impossible for anyone
to have been around him at the time.

31:29.851 --> 31:32.453
He's the one who cut his own throat, all right?
I don't know why we keep going over this.

31:32.453 --> 31:36.821
Physical evidence can tell
a clear story with a forked tongue.

31:36.821 --> 31:38.149
What?

31:38.149 --> 31:42.554
And as we can see from this morning.
Everyone can lie.

31:44.278 --> 31:47.220
Well. Almost everyone.

31:49.554 --> 31:51.068
Miss Cabrera.

31:52.111 --> 31:55.841
We kept you waiting all afternoon
because I wanted to hear from you last.

31:57.159 --> 32:00.843
I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head.

32:01.688 --> 32:05.333
Your piece of it
is at its very center.

32:06.576 --> 32:09.181
So please, take your time.

32:11.084 --> 32:17.502
You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs
at 11:30, and left at midnight.

32:18.137 --> 32:23.264
Think very carefully
and with as much detail as possible.

32:24.119 --> 32:26.943
Tell us what happened
in that half hour.

32:33.080 --> 32:34.304
- I got it.
- You got it?

32:34.744 --> 32:36.082
I got it.

32:36.734 --> 32:38.736
Okay, that's... Hey.

32:38.988 --> 32:41.240
Harlan. Let's...

32:42.474 --> 32:44.331
There are no second thoughts!

32:44.515 --> 32:46.036
No, no.

32:46.097 --> 32:47.781
- Get up here!
- I had dose of champagne.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.919
You only had one glass.

32:51.258 --> 32:54.846
We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!

32:54.846 --> 32:57.248
Can you just take your
goddamn medicine and go to bed?

32:57.248 --> 33:02.256
If you're gonna put that vile shit in me
you'll have to earn it. On my birthday.

33:02.256 --> 33:04.802
- 85th birthday.
- Fine, Jesus.

33:04.802 --> 33:06.502
I'm so old.

33:07.136 --> 33:08.816
You really love drama, huh?

33:10.106 --> 33:13.077
Okay, let's do this, 9 by 9.
You ready?

33:13.302 --> 33:14.867
- I'll whip your ass.
- Are you sure?

33:16.288 --> 33:17.844
How dare you?

33:20.198 --> 33:21.938
I know how this is gonna end.

33:23.185 --> 33:24.568
What is that?

33:24.568 --> 33:26.389
Why can't I beat you at this game?

33:26.389 --> 33:29.462
Because I'm not playing to beat you,
I'm playing to built a beautiful pattern.

33:29.462 --> 33:32.643
That's elder abuse. I'm gonna call the AARP.

33:32.643 --> 33:34.505
Don't make me get the belt,
I would, you know.

33:34.505 --> 33:36.286
It's basically over.

33:37.078 --> 33:39.228
My only hope is
that an earthquake will strike.

33:40.207 --> 33:42.185
But what are the chances?

33:45.452 --> 33:47.178
Hello?

33:48.763 --> 33:50.436
Get under a door frame!

33:55.495 --> 33:58.735
Such a bad loser you are.
Meds, then bed.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.465
I'm done with you.

34:01.088 --> 34:02.371
That's fair.

34:05.484 --> 34:10.339
Walt is smoking that filthy cigar
out there on the porch. Nasty things.

34:12.222 --> 34:13.556
How was tonight?

34:13.556 --> 34:15.839
Tonight was good.

34:16.561 --> 34:19.880
Oh, yeah? I know you weren't
looking forward to it.

34:19.880 --> 34:24.710
No. But I did it.
I cut the line on all four of them.

34:27.507 --> 34:32.215
It wasn't easy. This goddamn fortune.

34:34.243 --> 34:37.530
You know, sometimes I think that
everything I've given my family,

34:37.530 --> 34:43.367
I've done maybe, without knowing,
or maybe, to keep them beneath me.

34:44.839 --> 34:47.146
I certainly should have...
I don't know...

34:47.487 --> 34:51.058
encouraged Walt to write
his own stories,

34:51.058 --> 34:54.966
not just be a caretaker of mine.

34:55.177 --> 34:56.982
Like you said I should.

34:57.388 --> 35:02.439
And then be a father, not just a provider
for Joni, like you've also said.

35:02.762 --> 35:06.067
I could've been kinder
to Linda and Ransom.

35:07.196 --> 35:09.107
Jesus, Ransom.

35:10.998 --> 35:14.471
There's so much of me in that kid.

35:15.532 --> 35:19.059
Confident, stupid, I dunno.

35:19.059 --> 35:25.071
Protected. Playing life like a game
without consequence,

35:27.199 --> 35:29.459
until you can't tell the difference

35:30.065 --> 35:34.354
between a stage prop
and a real knife.

35:36.039 --> 35:37.853
I don't fear death.

35:38.375 --> 35:43.647
But, oh God, I'd like to fix
some of this before I go.

35:44.022 --> 35:46.186
Close the book with a flourish.

35:49.434 --> 35:51.058
I guess we'll see.

35:51.929 --> 35:53.460
I guess we will.

35:58.629 --> 35:59.682
Hey.

36:00.041 --> 36:03.637
You had a long day.
You wanna do drugs.

36:04.265 --> 36:06.446
- You mean the good stuff?
- Yeah.

36:07.531 --> 36:11.147
Come on, send me to lala land.

36:11.147 --> 36:13.244
Just a tiny bit, okay?

36:13.696 --> 36:16.788
Why did I wait till my mid 80s
to become a morphine user.

36:16.788 --> 36:19.780
What a schmuck.
What a nud-nig.

36:21.249 --> 36:22.579
This stuff is the best.

36:28.195 --> 36:29.897
Oh my god!

36:30.864 --> 36:32.288
Is there a problem?

36:34.957 --> 36:37.640
This is what I just gave you
a 100 milligrams of.

36:39.019 --> 36:40.407
I messed up.

36:40.707 --> 36:44.195
You gave me a 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?

36:46.481 --> 36:50.616
Excuse me, but what is the good stuff's
dosage supposed to be?

36:50.818 --> 36:53.839
Let's not call it that right now, okay?
Three milligrams.

36:53.996 --> 36:57.147
That's much less. So what happens?

36:57.824 --> 37:01.767
I'm gonna give you an emergency shot
of Naloxone, so that you don't die in ten minutes.

37:01.838 --> 37:03.177
Well, no pressure.

37:04.611 --> 37:07.378
You know, this is
an interesting and efficient

37:07.891 --> 37:10.453
method of murder.
I need to write this down.

37:10.826 --> 37:16.391
So, if someone switched the meds
on purpose, I'd be dead in ten minutes.

37:17.013 --> 37:18.673
Like stone cold dead?

37:18.673 --> 37:22.259
Yes, you'll feel symptoms in five.
Sweats, disorientation, and then...

37:23.371 --> 37:26.157
Yes, that big dose injected,
within ten your

37:26.852 --> 37:30.415
Your brain... Yes, ten minutes.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.546
Yeah, from the moment of injection.

37:32.848 --> 37:34.247
It's eightish now.

37:34.247 --> 37:38.532
And even if the victim called
for an ambulance when he first felt symptoms,

37:38.532 --> 37:42.032
and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do.

37:42.032 --> 37:47.576
The ambulance would take at least
15 minutes to arrive, it'd be too late.

37:48.741 --> 37:52.370
If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.

37:53.906 --> 37:57.355
Marta. Do you have the Naxostuff?

37:57.355 --> 37:59.289
Yes, I'm gonna find it.

37:59.594 --> 38:05.086
I have it because it comes with the kit,
it should be here, it has to be, it's like a...

38:14.918 --> 38:18.977
It's not here, Harlan.
I don't know, it's not here.

38:18.977 --> 38:20.906
So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay?

38:21.614 --> 38:23.366
To call an ambulance.

38:36.352 --> 38:37.786
What are you doing?

38:39.667 --> 38:41.278
What are you doing?

38:42.869 --> 38:44.836
Marta, listen to me.

38:44.972 --> 38:45.846
Harlan, I need to...

38:45.846 --> 38:49.284
Stop this! Stop this, Marta!
There is no time, you have to listen!

38:49.284 --> 38:50.782
I'm calling the family!

38:55.209 --> 38:57.487
What are you doing?
Are you nuts?

38:58.093 --> 39:00.340
Harlan, we have to call the ambulance,
we don't have time!

39:00.340 --> 39:01.689
Listen to me!

39:02.815 --> 39:05.860
If what you said is true,
I'm gone, there's no saving me.

39:06.580 --> 39:08.132
We have six minutes.

39:08.721 --> 39:12.376
We have got to get you out of this.
Think of your mom.

39:12.938 --> 39:14.216
My mom?

39:16.159 --> 39:18.533
Get behind, get behind.
Don't make a noise.

39:19.383 --> 39:20.382
Harlan?

39:21.225 --> 39:23.586
Marta? Everything all right?

39:24.376 --> 39:26.451
- Hi, Joni.
- Hi.

39:26.639 --> 39:28.708
I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?

39:29.082 --> 39:30.455
We're fine.

39:31.367 --> 39:34.762
I just knocked over
the GO board, sorry about that.

39:34.954 --> 39:36.023
Everyone's all right?

39:36.023 --> 39:38.794
Yes, fine. Go to bed Joni.

39:38.794 --> 39:43.112
Okay. Maybe, we can talk tomorrow
about the thing with..

39:43.112 --> 39:44.644
Tomorrow is fine.

39:44.987 --> 39:46.182
- Love you.
- Love you.

39:46.182 --> 39:48.031
Night.

39:51.056 --> 39:52.528
Come on.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.874
Pay attention now.

39:55.375 --> 39:58.674
Your mom is still undocumented,

39:58.674 --> 40:00.342
and if this is your fault

40:00.494 --> 40:05.088
she'll be found out and, at best, deported,
and your family will be broken.

40:05.088 --> 40:07.467
But we're not gonna let
that happen, are we?

40:07.963 --> 40:10.532
But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.

40:11.032 --> 40:12.939
Will you do this Marta?

40:14.493 --> 40:19.044
This last thing.
For me. For your family.

40:22.548 --> 40:24.447
What do you want me to do?

40:25.684 --> 40:30.232
Go downstairs as noisily as you can,
and then say goodbye loudly.

40:30.232 --> 40:31.240
Walt! I'm leaving!

40:31.240 --> 40:32.650
Call attention to the time.

40:32.650 --> 40:33.889
God, it's midnight already.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.194
If you can.

40:36.652 --> 40:39.931
Drive out the gate, then to avoid
the security cameras,

40:39.931 --> 40:43.335
pull off the road
before the carved elephant.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.684
Wait, was it before or after?

40:46.684 --> 40:48.110
<i>After the carved elephant.</i>

40:48.110 --> 40:50.197
No, he said before? Was it?

40:50.197 --> 40:51.855
<i>Beafterfore the carved elephant.</i>

40:51.855 --> 40:53.456
Oh, shit!

40:56.613 --> 41:00.012
Park and come back on foot
up to the house.

41:00.929 --> 41:03.850
Take the side yard path,
through that little gate.

41:04.745 --> 41:07.213
The dogs will know you,
they shouldn't bark.

41:08.498 --> 41:12.146
You've got to get up to the third floor
without being seen.

41:12.310 --> 41:17.328
And the only way is to climb the side trellis
and come in through the trick hall window.

41:17.734 --> 41:20.857
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I am not. Do it.

41:29.494 --> 41:32.286
And for God's sake
don't make any noise.

41:42.752 --> 41:45.428
Once you're inside.
Now, this is the tricky part.

41:45.722 --> 41:47.065
This is the tricky part?

41:47.335 --> 41:52.216
Get my robe and cap
from my bedroom, and put them on.

41:52.216 --> 41:55.197
Harlan, this is crazy.
I don't think I can do...

41:55.197 --> 41:56.805
We need to make this so airtight

41:56.805 --> 42:00.655
that the average cop
will entirely dismiss you as a suspect.

42:00.655 --> 42:02.886
It sounds crazy, but it will work.

42:07.466 --> 42:10.659
Walt is smoking outside,
and he'll see you

42:11.250 --> 42:12.823
through the glazed window.

42:12.823 --> 42:15.240
Dad, go back to bed.

42:16.430 --> 42:20.590
You were seen leaving,
the security cameras show you driving off.

42:20.590 --> 42:25.150
And twenty minutes later
I am seen alive and well by my son.

42:25.538 --> 42:30.319
You see, you've gone from suspect
number one to an impossibility.

42:30.638 --> 42:35.896
Leave the way you came,
and don't be seen.

42:45.924 --> 42:47.643
Ransom?

42:48.665 --> 42:51.110
Are you back again already?

42:54.500 --> 42:55.640
Drive home.

42:56.149 --> 43:00.330
And sometime, in the next few days
the police will question you.

43:00.334 --> 43:02.406
No, no, no.

43:03.001 --> 43:06.818
I can't lie, you know
I can't lie, I'll puke.

43:06.818 --> 43:08.060
Then don't lie.

43:08.060 --> 43:11.424
Tell fragments of the truth.
In this exact order:

43:18.537 --> 43:23.692
I took him upstairs,
we played our nightly game of GO.

43:25.221 --> 43:30.905
At some point he knocked the board over
and Joni came up to check on us.

43:34.604 --> 43:39.302
I gave him pain medication,
he pulled his shoulder last week.

43:41.195 --> 43:45.357
And I left him
in his study at midnight.

43:45.612 --> 43:47.978
I said goodbye to Walt.

43:49.153 --> 43:50.158
Went home.

43:50.158 --> 43:52.313
What kind of medication
did you give him?

43:55.510 --> 44:00.400
Since his injury I've been giving him
a 100 milligram IV push of Toradol.

44:00.516 --> 44:02.538
It's a non narcotic analgesic.

44:02.948 --> 44:06.953
And to help him sleep,
3 milligrams of morphine.

44:07.341 --> 44:10.179
- And the family was aware of this?
- Yes, of course.

44:10.424 --> 44:14.451
Did you notice anything strange,
off about his demeanor?

44:18.304 --> 44:19.835
No.

44:23.936 --> 44:26.003
Sounds about right.

44:26.678 --> 44:28.630
Thank you, Miss Cabrera.

44:47.182 --> 44:50.596
Hey, sis, people are gonna start
getting here for the memorial pretty soon.

44:50.596 --> 44:52.389
Are you..?

44:54.612 --> 44:55.884
Are you all right?

44:56.340 --> 44:58.955
I was just thinking
about Dad's games.

45:00.663 --> 45:05.707
This all feels like one,
like something he'd write, not do.

45:06.879 --> 45:09.741
I keep waiting for the big reveal,

45:11.478 --> 45:16.222
where it all makes sense,
wouldn't that be nice?

45:16.917 --> 45:18.989
Walter.

45:21.141 --> 45:24.765
I don't think he killed himself.
I don't. I really don't.

45:25.363 --> 45:29.159
There's this Hallmark movie called
"Deadly By Surprise" with Danica McKellar.

45:29.480 --> 45:33.151
And she plays the wife,
who's getting poisoned by her husband.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.951
But he's doing it little by little,
so she doesn't know it.

45:36.106 --> 45:38.318
And she goes crazy
and she kills herself.

45:38.459 --> 45:41.799
And my cousin, who's a receptionist
at the medical examiners office.

45:41.927 --> 45:44.071
She says that stuff totally happens.

45:44.071 --> 45:47.683
Say, with 3% as crazy as this stuff
she's seen come through the...

45:50.032 --> 45:51.789
Oh, God. Yeah, I mean...

45:51.789 --> 45:53.769
You don't like him
because you love him.

45:53.904 --> 45:56.528
No, I don't like him,
he's an asshole.

45:56.763 --> 45:59.416
But maybe, an asshole is what we needed.

45:59.907 --> 46:00.858
God, yeah...

46:00.858 --> 46:04.533
An asshole is what Germany
needed in nineteen thirty... whatever.

46:04.710 --> 46:06.608
Those 2 things don't even complete.

46:07.441 --> 46:11.916
Jesus, I'm gonna disappear
until the politics talk is done.

46:11.916 --> 46:13.663
You want some champers?

46:14.199 --> 46:16.092
I can't. I'm technically working.

46:16.604 --> 46:19.063
Take off your red cap, Richard
and look around you.

46:19.063 --> 46:21.213
The streets
are literally flooded with Nazis.

46:21.213 --> 46:22.396
No, no, no.

46:22.396 --> 46:25.866
We're losing our way of life
and our culture.

46:26.037 --> 46:28.331
There are millions of Mexicans coming.

46:28.460 --> 46:31.307
And don't make this a race thing.
You always make this a race thing.

46:31.307 --> 46:34.971
I would say the same thing
if they were European immigrants.

46:34.971 --> 46:36.881
If the Swiss were like
clogging in the streets...

46:36.881 --> 46:39.763
We allow them in and
they think they own...

46:39.763 --> 46:43.805
They're putting children in cages.
I mean, these are camps!

46:43.805 --> 46:46.711
Come on, Joni.
Nobody's saying that isn't bad,

46:46.711 --> 46:48.490
but the parents
have some blame here.

46:48.542 --> 46:50.903
For what? For wanting a better life
for their kids?

46:50.903 --> 46:52.021
Isn't that what America is..?

46:52.021 --> 46:54.331
For breaking the law.

46:54.761 --> 46:57.469
And you gonna hate hearing this,
but it's true.

46:57.469 --> 46:59.533
- America is for Americans.
- Don't point at me!

46:59.533 --> 47:01.085
Where is Marta,
is she still here?

47:01.085 --> 47:05.391
Marta. Come on over.
Marta, please. Come over.

47:06.168 --> 47:11.349
Marta, your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.

47:11.843 --> 47:15.695
What I'm saying is, they did it legally.
She did it the right way.

47:16.026 --> 47:19.989
You work hard, and you'll earn
your share from the ground up

47:19.989 --> 47:22.629
just like Dad
and like all the rest of us.

47:22.629 --> 47:24.205
And I bet
you agree with me, right?

47:24.205 --> 47:26.736
Just leave the poor girl
alone, Richard.

47:26.736 --> 47:29.390
It's okay, I just wanna
hear what she has to say.

47:29.390 --> 47:30.343
It's okay, Marta, you can speak.

47:30.343 --> 47:32.353
Oh, sweetheart, don't feel
pressured to answer.

47:32.690 --> 47:38.102
Look, if you wanna become an American,
there are legal ways to do it.

47:38.763 --> 47:42.415
But if you break the law,
it doesn't matter how good you heart is,

47:42.790 --> 47:45.159
you gotta face the consequences.

47:45.503 --> 47:47.672
Are you, goddamn, insane?

47:47.672 --> 47:49.747
- Hey!
- I warn you!

47:55.573 --> 47:58.754
So I ask her, I'm like, Tonya,
what is wrong with people literally?

47:59.487 --> 48:01.391
Oh my God, Marta. What?

48:01.918 --> 48:04.093
Marta! What's the matter?

48:04.438 --> 48:08.075
Whoa, hey. Breathe.
Marta, are you okay?

48:09.696 --> 48:11.853
Hey, Fran, do you still have
your stash?

48:17.496 --> 48:18.976
Take 'em whenever you need 'em.

48:18.976 --> 48:21.124
They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.

48:21.443 --> 48:22.787
Thanks Fran.

48:22.960 --> 48:23.892
Hey.

48:23.892 --> 48:26.821
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm very very sorry.

48:26.821 --> 48:29.413
Stop. Stop saying
you're sorry, Jesus.

48:29.774 --> 48:31.910
God, my heart won't stop, I can't...

48:33.595 --> 48:35.821
It's just everything.
No, thank you.

48:38.520 --> 48:40.287
That's where Fran keeps her stash?

48:42.119 --> 48:43.534
Who's gonna open a clock?

48:45.129 --> 48:50.046
Do you want dinner, Nana?
Dinner? To eat? To eat?

48:51.950 --> 48:54.798
Walt, she's fine, she ate
the entire salmon spread already.

48:56.863 --> 48:59.507
Walt, did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?

48:59.507 --> 49:01.279
No, not yet.
Is now a good time?

49:01.279 --> 49:03.462
Yes, yes a very good time.
Right now.

49:03.743 --> 49:07.603
Okay, all right.
Calm down. Calm down.

49:09.314 --> 49:13.355
Marta. We've been talking it over, and...

49:14.962 --> 49:16.988
Have you been smoking grass?

49:16.988 --> 49:19.306
No. Come on.

49:19.641 --> 49:21.971
Marta, we've been talking it over,

49:21.971 --> 49:25.989
the whole family,
we'd like to take care of you.

49:27.612 --> 49:28.859
What does that mean?

49:29.830 --> 49:31.723
We all think
that you deserve something.

49:31.723 --> 49:34.280
Financially, we'd like to help you out.

49:34.280 --> 49:36.492
You were never anything
but good to dad.

49:37.590 --> 49:41.444
Because of that
you can count on us.

49:46.076 --> 49:50.563
I thought you should've been
at the funeral, by the way. I was outvoted.

50:01.586 --> 50:05.236
Detective, you're still here?

50:11.520 --> 50:13.164
Did you know Harlan?

50:13.357 --> 50:16.771
He knew my father,
who was a police detective, years ago.

50:18.939 --> 50:23.109
My father respected Harlan.
That says quite a lot.

50:23.532 --> 50:25.004
Is that why you're here?

50:26.303 --> 50:28.836
Here, now here? No.

50:30.060 --> 50:32.408
I stayed hoping to speak
to you a little more.

50:37.727 --> 50:40.839
Something is afoot
with this whole affair.

50:42.291 --> 50:45.658
I know it, and I believe
you know it too.

50:47.737 --> 50:49.516
So, you're gonna keep digging.

50:50.378 --> 50:56.869
Harlan's detectives, they dig,
they rifle and root, truffle pigs.

50:58.801 --> 51:02.688
I anticipate the terminus
of gravity's rainbow.

51:03.699 --> 51:05.450
Gravity's Rainbow?

51:05.450 --> 51:08.119
- It's a novel.
- Yeah, I know.

51:08.630 --> 51:10.993
- I haven't read it though.
- Neither have I.

51:10.993 --> 51:13.553
Nobody has. But I like the title.

51:14.507 --> 51:18.770
It describes the path of a projectile,
determined by natural law.

51:19.097 --> 51:20.901
I Voilà, my method.

51:21.585 --> 51:25.104
I observe the facts,
without biases of the head or heart.

51:25.620 --> 51:29.547
I determine the arc's path,
stroll leisurely to its terminus,

51:30.343 --> 51:32.689
and the truth falls at my feet.

51:35.698 --> 51:38.737
The medical examiner
was ready to rule this a suicide,

51:38.737 --> 51:42.078
but Elliott agreed
to keep it pending for 48 hours.

51:42.523 --> 51:46.574
Tomorrow morning I search the grounds
and the house, begin my investigation.

51:47.828 --> 51:50.061
I want you to be
by my side for it.

51:50.061 --> 51:50.648
What?

51:50.648 --> 51:52.530
My confidant, my eyes and ears.

51:52.530 --> 51:54.465
Wait, detective. Why me?

51:54.465 --> 51:56.836
I trust your kind heart.

51:58.816 --> 52:02.065
Also, you're the only one
who had nothing to gain from Harlan's death.

52:03.175 --> 52:05.097
So, how about it, Watson?

52:05.693 --> 52:09.278
Detective, if you want my insight
into this family.

52:10.548 --> 52:13.856
None of them are murderers.
That's my insight.

52:14.127 --> 52:17.690
And yet. Be it cruel or comforting,

52:18.392 --> 52:21.828
this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.

52:22.864 --> 52:24.408
That's what it does.

52:25.810 --> 52:27.182
Always?

52:28.107 --> 52:29.870
Tomorrow at 8.

53:00.288 --> 53:03.380
I know I missed something,
there's gonna be something I missed.

53:03.380 --> 53:05.416
- But I know you can beat it
- No, I can't...

53:05.416 --> 53:10.240
without losing your soul you have to do
what you have to do to beat this and win.

53:10.240 --> 53:11.696
Harlan, I can't.

53:11.696 --> 53:13.826
You can and you have to.

53:15.075 --> 53:17.663
For me. Right now!

53:37.444 --> 53:39.307
Harlan, I have to get you help.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.579
You do as I say

53:43.216 --> 53:46.194
- and everything will be just fine.
- God, no.

53:47.786 --> 53:49.873
I promise.

53:49.873 --> 53:51.873
Please...

55:00.182 --> 55:02.826
Fifty years ago I worked at this estate.

55:03.196 --> 55:09.565
You know, security back then was such
that you had to make the rounds with a 94

55:09.887 --> 55:12.142
and keeping your ears open.

55:12.695 --> 55:16.328
Now, you got all this
modern technology.

55:17.933 --> 55:22.082
That's the video there,
I saved the tape from that night.

55:22.255 --> 55:25.744
Normally, I erase 'em
with the magnetic de-gauser.

55:25.744 --> 55:28.795
But in this case I thought
I just save it, you know?

55:29.003 --> 55:33.252
For security. That's the live feed there.

55:34.758 --> 55:39.530
<i>To avoid the security cameras,
pull off the road after the carved elephant.</i>

55:39.530 --> 55:41.729
All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?

55:41.729 --> 55:43.494
Of course, you can.

55:43.702 --> 55:50.100
I recorded it SSLP.
There's 8 hours on that tape, 9 PM to 5 AM.

56:00.198 --> 56:02.099
Looks like a Japanese horror movie.

56:02.099 --> 56:04.374
You think we can scan forward on that?

56:05.481 --> 56:06.911
How can we scan forward?

56:07.107 --> 56:12.801
Just hold the play button down
and press FF until you hear it grind.

56:18.989 --> 56:22.496
All right, should be coming up now
at the time when the party ended.

56:25.601 --> 56:26.582
What happened?

56:26.582 --> 56:29.656
You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.

56:29.725 --> 56:31.975
That thing eats tapes like popcorn.

56:31.975 --> 56:35.392
You think your guys can digitize it,
so we can scan it properly?

56:35.392 --> 56:37.177
Yeah, I think we can do that.

56:37.745 --> 56:39.197
I got it.

56:41.458 --> 56:43.465
You know, all these statues
that you see around here,

56:43.617 --> 56:47.921
they are all straight out of his series
"The Menagerie Tragedy" trilogy, pretty cool.

56:48.083 --> 56:49.918
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

56:50.471 --> 56:52.664
Benny. It's beautiful out here.

56:52.664 --> 56:55.389
But do you really think someone
broken into the house and murdered Harlan?

56:55.389 --> 56:56.697
Is that why we're out here?

56:56.697 --> 57:00.456
It is unlikely, but if they did,
there will be traces.

57:00.876 --> 57:02.790
- I can take on that.
- Yeah.

57:11.417 --> 57:14.089
Hey Wagner, you got any luck on...

57:15.719 --> 57:16.847
- What's his name?
- Ransom?

57:16.847 --> 57:17.726
Yeah.

57:17.889 --> 57:19.129
No.

57:20.201 --> 57:24.633
Did get an address though.
10 Kenoak street.

57:25.525 --> 57:28.845
Ten Kenoak. Kenoak.

57:30.110 --> 57:32.282
It's a pleasant thing to say, isn't it?

57:32.654 --> 57:38.007
Kenoak. I awoke
amid Kenoak. That's funny.

57:38.007 --> 57:42.176
Always leaves and mud,
they really gonna do a number on my boots.

57:42.531 --> 57:45.107
Mud, has it rained the past week?

57:45.846 --> 57:47.607
- No. Stay there!
- What?

57:48.539 --> 57:50.862
Okay. We got footprints here.

57:50.862 --> 57:53.073
So, I wanna...

57:53.619 --> 57:56.312
- Marta, stop.
- What?

57:57.044 --> 57:57.693
What?

57:57.693 --> 57:59.481
- Marta, stay there.
- What?

57:59.481 --> 58:02.076
No, Marta, stay there, Marta! No!

58:02.678 --> 58:03.900
Did you call me?

58:03.900 --> 58:05.475
Excuse me.

58:05.475 --> 58:07.831
Wagner, we gonna need to call the boys,
so they come down here

58:07.831 --> 58:10.168
and take a look at
all these tracks, get it taped off.

58:10.168 --> 58:11.946
- Stay on that side.
- I'm sorry.

58:14.714 --> 58:16.114
Hey.

58:19.881 --> 58:24.332
Best judge of character is a dog.
I found that to be true.

58:33.539 --> 58:35.964
They've got plans
to read the will at around 10.

58:37.005 --> 58:38.847
The whole family will be here soon.

58:41.417 --> 58:43.206
I've never been to a will reading.

58:44.458 --> 58:46.454
You think it'll be like a game show.

58:47.076 --> 58:51.190
Think of a community theater
production of a tax return.

58:52.639 --> 58:54.501
So, what are we looking for?

58:54.501 --> 58:58.416
Oh, you know, anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.

58:59.023 --> 59:00.698
You'll know it when you see it.

59:01.526 --> 59:02.989
Oh my God!

59:03.675 --> 59:05.504
Sweet beans!

59:09.340 --> 59:13.007
Well, good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

59:22.109 --> 59:24.152
You think you could
handle the study?

59:33.829 --> 59:35.918
Where's your medical bag?

59:36.202 --> 59:40.153
I don't know. I left it here.
I always leave it here with Harlan at night.

59:40.153 --> 59:42.986
They must've taken it in
as evidence. I'll look into that.

59:48.822 --> 59:50.234
Shit.

59:52.600 --> 59:55.095
How'd the GO board get knocked over?

59:55.282 --> 59:57.155
We were just goofing around.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.453
What are you thinking?

01:00:14.994 --> 01:00:17.307
No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey!

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:19.428
Let me guess.

01:00:19.428 --> 01:00:21.422
Hey. Stop. Stop.

01:00:22.343 --> 01:00:23.521
Stop. Stop.

01:00:24.194 --> 01:00:25.729
Hugh Drysdale?

01:00:26.551 --> 01:00:29.295
Ransom. Call me Ransom.
It's my middle name.

01:00:29.432 --> 01:00:31.035
Only the help call me Hugh.

01:00:31.951 --> 01:00:36.020
Okay, this is Trooper Wagner,
I'm Lieutenant Elliott.

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:38.470
We just wanna ask
a few questions.

01:00:42.569 --> 01:00:45.088
Excuse me. Sir?

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.648
We're officers of the law.

01:00:47.648 --> 01:00:50.734
You gonna run me in? I don't feel
like talking. I'm distraught.

01:00:51.287 --> 01:00:53.569
Hey Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?

01:00:53.569 --> 01:00:55.120
All right, what is this?
What's this arrangement?

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.583
Mr. Drysdale.

01:00:56.893 --> 01:00:59.055
CSI KFC?

01:01:03.945 --> 01:01:06.504
Hey Frannie, how about a glass
of cold milk?

01:01:06.852 --> 01:01:10.029
Hey asshole.
Not her name, Not her job.

01:01:10.354 --> 01:01:12.962
Hey Meg. How's your
SJW degree coming?

01:01:13.431 --> 01:01:15.937
- Trust fund prick.
- All right. Guys.

01:01:18.152 --> 01:01:19.660
Hey, everyone.

01:01:19.992 --> 01:01:24.291
I'm just gonna be in the other room,
setting up, be ready in 10 minutes.

01:01:30.038 --> 01:01:33.983
Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral,
but you're early for the will reading.

01:01:35.689 --> 01:01:38.729
Okay, people grieve
in different ways, let's not...

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.371
You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.

01:01:40.371 --> 01:01:43.228
Why are you even bothering?
That's what I'm asking myself.

01:01:43.629 --> 01:01:44.996
What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:44.996 --> 01:01:48.031
- He knows what it supposed to mean.
- Wait. Walt. What?

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.871
Jacob was in that bathroom
in the night of the party.

01:01:55.354 --> 01:01:57.311
Oh, that's where
you were all night?

01:01:57.311 --> 01:01:59.744
The hell were you doing in the
bathroom all night?

01:01:59.744 --> 01:02:01.785
- Nothing.
- Swatting Syrian refugees?

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:03.718
- No. I was not.
- Alt right troll.

01:02:03.718 --> 01:02:05.006
Liberal snowflake.

01:02:05.006 --> 01:02:06.647
I don't know
what any of that means.

01:02:06.647 --> 01:02:08.466
It means your son's
a little creep.

01:02:08.466 --> 01:02:11.114
Oh, my son's a creep?

01:02:11.114 --> 01:02:12.715
Guys! Just...

01:02:12.715 --> 01:02:14.388
Walt, he was in the bathroom.

01:02:14.388 --> 01:02:15.730
Yeah, he was in the bathroom,

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:18.730
joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.

01:02:19.814 --> 01:02:22.030
You know what, Richard?
You wanna go?

01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:23.728
You bet, Skippy. Let's go!

01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:25.148
You wanna go? C'mon!

01:02:25.319 --> 01:02:26.615
You better watch out!

01:02:26.615 --> 01:02:27.880
Stop!

01:02:29.417 --> 01:02:31.945
C'mon, you had me
waiting for it my whole life!

01:02:31.945 --> 01:02:33.648
Stop it right now!

01:02:33.648 --> 01:02:35.859
I can handle myself!
I can handle it.

01:02:35.859 --> 01:02:37.349
Oh my God!

01:02:37.542 --> 01:02:39.381
We gotta do this more often.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:40.941
Hey!

01:02:41.108 --> 01:02:43.740
Jacob, we know
where this is going.

01:02:44.033 --> 01:02:46.098
You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,

01:02:46.098 --> 01:02:47.797
where he had the fight
with Ransom.

01:02:47.952 --> 01:02:50.325
Now, you heard something. Spill it.

01:02:52.595 --> 01:02:54.343
I just heard two things.

01:02:58.005 --> 01:02:59.289
...my will!

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:01.046
My will.

01:03:01.233 --> 01:03:03.647
And then there was more yelling,

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:09.419
and then I heard
Ransom say "I'm warning you."

01:03:13.319 --> 01:03:16.071
Ransom? What's that mean?

01:03:16.426 --> 01:03:18.929
I think that means our father
finally came to his senses

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.851
and cut this worthless little brat
out of his will.

01:03:22.642 --> 01:03:24.944
So, I guess you gonna have to
sell the Beamer,

01:03:24.944 --> 01:03:26.887
and give your notice
at the country club,

01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:29.331
and kick whatever fashion drugs
you're on.

01:03:29.497 --> 01:03:32.799
Because if you think that after
all the bridges you burned,

01:03:32.799 --> 01:03:35.588
After all the shit you said,
after everything that you put

01:03:35.588 --> 01:03:37.706
this family through
for the last 10 years,

01:03:37.706 --> 01:03:40.362
that any of us
are gonna support you,

01:03:40.362 --> 01:03:42.316
that any of us
are gonna give you,

01:03:42.316 --> 01:03:48.429
like dad liked to say,
a single red dime, you're nuts!

01:03:52.232 --> 01:03:53.462
Son.

01:03:54.473 --> 01:03:55.646
Father?

01:03:56.434 --> 01:03:59.780
Did Harlan tell you he was
gonna cut you out of the will?

01:04:01.669 --> 01:04:02.979
Yup.

01:04:05.907 --> 01:04:10.553
Well, then he's done what
none of us were strong enough to do.

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:14.513
Maybe this might finally
make you grow up.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:20.250
This might be the best thing
that could ever happen to you.

01:04:20.463 --> 01:04:22.788
Thank you. My mother,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:22.971 --> 01:04:26.726
Look, this is not gonna be easy
for you, but it'll be good.

01:04:27.305 --> 01:04:29.275
Nothing good is ever easy.

01:04:29.617 --> 01:04:30.735
Up your ass, Joni.

01:04:30.735 --> 01:04:33.121
You've got your teeth in this family's
tit for a long time.

01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:35.194
Up your ass? Very nice.

01:04:35.194 --> 01:04:38.087
Matter of fact -
eat shit, hows that?

01:04:38.899 --> 01:04:42.200
In fact, eat shit,
eat shit, eat shit.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.038
- You entitled prick!
- I would snap that smug smile...

01:04:45.038 --> 01:04:47.562
Definitely eat shit. Eat shit.

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.576
I own it, shit!

01:04:55.162 --> 01:04:57.718
What was that about
will readings being boring?

01:04:58.532 --> 01:05:00.721
Exception that proves the rule.

01:05:03.244 --> 01:05:04.742
Asshole.

01:05:05.509 --> 01:05:09.879
I'm warning you.
Ransom said "I'm warning you."

01:05:10.225 --> 01:05:12.960
You heard Ransom in there,
that's the kind of thing he says.

01:05:13.756 --> 01:05:15.562
You want this? You want this?

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:22.349
What do we have here?

01:05:27.782 --> 01:05:31.190
This looks like
a relatively fresh break.

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:33.344
Yup. Right there.

01:05:33.985 --> 01:05:34.997
Wait a minute.

01:05:35.303 --> 01:05:39.452
That doesn't make sense.
Where's that window?

01:05:40.119 --> 01:05:43.827
How about some more cookies, you?
You want some more cookies?

01:05:45.355 --> 01:05:49.550
Hey, maybe Harlem left you
a cold glass of milk in his will, asshole!

01:05:51.831 --> 01:05:53.874
Show me, but stay off the carpet.

01:06:08.827 --> 01:06:12.416
It's the trick window!
From "A Kill For All Seasons!"

01:06:12.519 --> 01:06:14.342
Trooper, here, will you take this?

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:29.150
Traces of dried mud.

01:06:29.674 --> 01:06:32.505
I suspect they go
the length of the hallway.

01:06:33.668 --> 01:06:34.862
Footprints?

01:06:34.862 --> 01:06:36.708
No, just traces.

01:06:36.887 --> 01:06:39.509
Depending on when this thing
was last cleaned,

01:06:39.879 --> 01:06:42.631
this could've happened
at anytime, right?

01:06:42.674 --> 01:06:45.839
No, that would not explain this.

01:06:46.579 --> 01:06:49.741
Analyze that mud.
It will match these traces.

01:06:50.286 --> 01:06:54.474
And you will find similar samples,
leading up the trellis on the outside of the house.

01:06:55.328 --> 01:06:59.384
On the night of the party, somebody
who did not want to be heard climbing those steps

01:06:59.543 --> 01:07:03.500
went to a great deal of trouble
to break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.071
The game is afoot, eh Watson?

01:07:17.914 --> 01:07:20.806
Well. Thank you all for
getting together like this,

01:07:20.806 --> 01:07:24.378
it isn't legally necessary,
but I thought because you're all in town

01:07:24.378 --> 01:07:26.047
and some of you are leaving soon...

01:07:26.047 --> 01:07:28.802
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:07:29.769 --> 01:07:34.823
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to
gently request that you all stay in town

01:07:34.982 --> 01:07:36.901
until the investigation is completed.

01:07:36.901 --> 01:07:40.351
He's gently requesting,
but we gotta make that an order.

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:42.266
No one move
until we figure this all out.

01:07:42.697 --> 01:07:44.628
- What?
- Can we ask why?

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:46.066
- Has something changed?
- No.

01:07:46.066 --> 01:07:48.169
No it hasn't changed
or no we can't ask?

01:07:48.169 --> 01:07:51.200
Mr. Stevens, you may continue.

01:07:51.627 --> 01:07:57.042
Right. Well the other reason I thought
this gathering would be beneficial

01:07:57.214 --> 01:08:02.622
is because Harlan altered
his will a week before he died.

01:08:02.622 --> 01:08:08.336
He sealed, he asked me not to submit
it to the courts for probate until after his death.

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:13.030
If anyone is confused about anything,
we're all together, we can talk.

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:17.162
Although, I don't imagine any of it
is going to be that complicated.

01:08:17.768 --> 01:08:19.622
Harlan's assets included

01:08:20.645 --> 01:08:22.099
- The house.
- The house,

01:08:22.099 --> 01:08:23.643
which he owned outright.

01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:26.460
- Sixty million.
- Yes.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:30.113
Sixty million in various
cash accounts and investments.

01:08:30.277 --> 01:08:33.636
And, of course, the real asset -

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.800
sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,
his publishing company.

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:43.098
He also wrote up a statement when he was making
the changes and he wanted that read first.

01:08:45.786 --> 01:08:48.377
"Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni.

01:08:48.569 --> 01:08:51.348
Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.

01:08:51.348 --> 01:08:53.933
No pleasure was taken
in the exclusion,

01:08:53.933 --> 01:08:58.660
and its purpose was not to sow
greater discord in the family, quite the opposite.

01:08:59.118 --> 01:09:02.910
Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness. But do accept it.

01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:05.502
It's for the best, Dad."

01:09:19.024 --> 01:09:21.611
Wow, well, yeah.
Not too complex at all.

01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:23.879
This'll be quick.

01:09:24.853 --> 01:09:30.033
I, Harlan Thrombey, being of sound mind
and body, yada yada...

01:09:31.274 --> 01:09:35.335
I hereby direct that all my assets,
both liquid and otherwise,

01:09:35.493 --> 01:09:39.261
I leave in their entirety
to Marta Cabrera.

01:09:40.756 --> 01:09:43.491
My entire ownership
of Blood Like Wine publishing

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.488
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera.

01:09:46.661 --> 01:09:51.680
The copyright of its catalog likewise
I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera."

01:09:55.771 --> 01:09:57.058
What?

01:10:01.807 --> 01:10:04.555
No. That's not...

01:10:04.736 --> 01:10:05.924
No.

01:10:05.924 --> 01:10:08.171
That can't be.
Can I see that please, Alan?

01:10:08.171 --> 01:10:09.470
- That's right.
- Please.

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:10.616
This can't be legal.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.499
It's right.

01:10:12.568 --> 01:10:14.030
- You know, he's been...
- Oh my God!

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:16.303
Alan, it's a mistake.

01:10:16.303 --> 01:10:18.555
I don't know what to say,
we're his family, so...

01:10:19.107 --> 01:10:20.602
It's not possible!

01:10:20.662 --> 01:10:22.644
Are there safeguards against this?

01:10:25.835 --> 01:10:26.790
Harlan was...

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.619
In his final days
he was under weight of medication.

01:10:29.769 --> 01:10:31.827
Obviously, he wasn't...
I mean... I don't know...

01:10:32.815 --> 01:10:38.759
Alan, you can take this piece of paper
and shove it right up your ass and get out.

01:10:38.932 --> 01:10:40.985
And you cops too.
Out! Out!

01:10:41.276 --> 01:10:42.393
- Right now!
- Melinda.

01:10:42.393 --> 01:10:46.096
No, Richard, we need to talk,
we need to fight this thing.

01:10:46.096 --> 01:10:48.693
We're not going anywhere.
I said get out!

01:10:49.379 --> 01:10:54.058
We're the Thrombeys goddammit!
This is still our house!

01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:02.569
Sorry.

01:11:02.866 --> 01:11:05.514
"Likewise the house at 2 Deerborn Drive

01:11:05.514 --> 01:11:08.666
and all belongings therein
I leave to Marta Cabrera."

01:11:10.949 --> 01:11:13.194
You little bitch!

01:11:13.362 --> 01:11:15.964
You little bitch!

01:11:16.097 --> 01:11:19.126
Did you know about this?
Were you in this from the beginning?

01:11:19.126 --> 01:11:20.530
No, no, no!
I just wanna know!

01:11:20.947 --> 01:11:23.580
What were you doing?
Were you boinking my father?

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.519
"Boinking?"

01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:27.356
I think everybody just needs to cool...

01:11:27.356 --> 01:11:30.337
You had sex with my grandpa.
You dirty anchor baby.

01:11:30.983 --> 01:11:33.324
In the meantime I'd maybe run.

01:11:34.154 --> 01:11:35.183
Marta.

01:11:35.549 --> 01:11:37.067
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Talk to us.

01:11:37.672 --> 01:11:40.021
Marta, wait a minute.

01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.124
I totally understand
how you must be feeling.

01:11:42.124 --> 01:11:42.991
You can talk to me.

01:11:42.991 --> 01:11:44.441
I don't know how this...

01:11:45.204 --> 01:11:46.589
I don't know.

01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:53.270
I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he...

01:11:53.379 --> 01:11:56.205
Guys, I'm also confused,
I need to think.

01:11:56.205 --> 01:11:57.954
Marta! You listen...

01:11:58.384 --> 01:11:59.638
I can't catch up!

01:12:04.533 --> 01:12:06.338
I can't open the damn...

01:12:08.368 --> 01:12:11.880
Marta, you have to understand.
He is our father.

01:12:12.347 --> 01:12:14.929
Marta, don't listen to them. I'm here.

01:12:15.108 --> 01:12:16.884
I'm not on Twitter anymore.

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:21.386
So, de-add me on Instagram, okay?
I wanna talk to you.

01:12:28.347 --> 01:12:29.415
What's going on?

01:12:29.415 --> 01:12:32.120
I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you!

01:12:34.289 --> 01:12:35.949
What does he mean by that?

01:12:37.403 --> 01:12:39.187
Richard, why didn't you stop he?

01:12:39.256 --> 01:12:42.117
What was I supposed to do?
Grab the bumper with my teeth?

01:12:52.394 --> 01:12:54.361
Okay, seriously though, what the hell?

01:12:59.488 --> 01:13:01.198
Hey, can we take an extra bowl?

01:13:01.198 --> 01:13:02.586
Sure.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.205
You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten anything today?

01:13:12.205 --> 01:13:13.506
Eat.

01:13:17.511 --> 01:13:18.828
This is a nightmare.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.529
So why?

01:13:23.868 --> 01:13:25.816
- Why?
- Why?

01:13:27.081 --> 01:13:30.117
Hey, this is everything.

01:13:31.239 --> 01:13:33.200
There gotta be a bigger reason why
and you know it.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.767
Well, how about it had to do more
with you guys than with me.

01:13:37.865 --> 01:13:39.200
Yeah.

01:13:39.951 --> 01:13:41.891
Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.818
Did he tell you anything?

01:13:48.818 --> 01:13:50.554
Only that I wasn't getting a cent.

01:13:50.554 --> 01:13:52.652
That's because he wanted you to build
something from the ground...

01:13:52.652 --> 01:13:54.327
"Build something
from the ground up", yeah.

01:13:54.327 --> 01:13:55.961
My mother built her business
from the ground up

01:13:55.961 --> 01:13:58.539
with a million dollar loan
from my grandfather.

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:01.623
My father owns none of it,
she made him sign a prenup.

01:14:01.667 --> 01:14:02.915
He lives in fear.

01:14:03.421 --> 01:14:06.576
And I know that's what grandfather
was trying to protect me from by doing this,

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:10.223
And I know I shouldn't say this
out loud, but when he told me, I...

01:14:11.972 --> 01:14:14.605
Jesus, I coulda killed him.

01:14:17.198 --> 01:14:19.827
After I left the party, though,
I was driving

01:14:20.372 --> 01:14:23.598
nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this...

01:14:25.804 --> 01:14:27.261
clarity.

01:14:27.745 --> 01:14:30.860
Like from here on out
I was gonna have to fend for myself.

01:14:31.661 --> 01:14:33.281
And that felt...

01:14:34.341 --> 01:14:35.638
Good.

01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:38.508
The old bastard.

01:14:41.508 --> 01:14:47.318
Marta I know three things.
One: I know he didn't commit suicide.

01:14:49.448 --> 01:14:50.422
What makes you think that?

01:14:50.422 --> 01:14:52.932
I don't think it. I know it.

01:14:53.606 --> 01:14:55.233
Because I knew my granddad.

01:14:55.233 --> 01:14:57.100
Maybe you and I
are the only two who knew him,

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.769
so you're not gonna bullshit
me on this, because two:

01:15:00.768 --> 01:15:02.718
I know lying makes you puke.

01:15:03.203 --> 01:15:05.752
'Cause of that mafia game
last 4th of July.

01:15:07.095 --> 01:15:08.553
And three:

01:15:10.176 --> 01:15:13.333
I know that you just ate a full plate
of baked beans and sausage.

01:15:15.984 --> 01:15:17.415
So.

01:15:19.044 --> 01:15:21.055
Look me in the eye

01:15:21.737 --> 01:15:24.376
and tell me what
happened to my grandfather.

01:15:27.306 --> 01:15:29.212
- You asshole.
- Marta.

01:15:30.218 --> 01:15:32.562
Tell me everything.

01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:37.590
Alan, there have got
to be options here.

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:40.032
No. I don't know how many times

01:15:40.032 --> 01:15:43.324
I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.

01:15:43.324 --> 01:15:46.718
If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,

01:15:46.718 --> 01:15:48.312
and we've all confirmed he was.

01:15:48.312 --> 01:15:51.020
Would a sound mind
do this! How? Sound how?

01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:53.483
The very action
speaks to unsoundness!

01:15:53.615 --> 01:15:55.044
Not legally, no.

01:15:55.682 --> 01:15:59.515
You, not liking what he did
does not speak to testamentary capacity.

01:15:59.515 --> 01:16:02.214
What about undue influence?

01:16:02.214 --> 01:16:04.589
Yes! Undue influence!
How about that?

01:16:05.108 --> 01:16:06.077
Did you just Google that?

01:16:06.077 --> 01:16:09.111
Look, if Marta was manipulating
dad somehow, and if...

01:16:09.111 --> 01:16:11.598
If somehow she had gotten
her hooks into him.

01:16:11.598 --> 01:16:13.996
You need a strong case for that.

01:16:14.439 --> 01:16:16.870
Your honor, "She endeared herself to him

01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:19.119
through hard work and good humor."

01:16:19.285 --> 01:16:21.384
That won't cut the salami.

01:16:21.524 --> 01:16:23.167
What about the slayer rule?

01:16:23.953 --> 01:16:25.298
I did just Google that.

01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:27.588
The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.

01:16:28.792 --> 01:16:30.363
What the hell is the slayer rule?

01:16:30.363 --> 01:16:34.501
It's if someone is convicted of killing
the person, they don't get their inheritance.

01:16:34.501 --> 01:16:38.416
Not even convicted, even if they're
held responsible for their death in civil court.

01:16:38.918 --> 01:16:40.392
Like OJ.

01:16:40.707 --> 01:16:46.320
Yes, Like OJ.
But Harlan committed suicide.

01:16:54.903 --> 01:16:56.630
Detective Blank.

01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:59.853
You said that the investigation is ongoing,
you made a point of that.

01:17:00.151 --> 01:17:01.629
Do you suspect foul play?

01:17:01.629 --> 01:17:04.756
Mister Blanc. If you please.

01:17:06.129 --> 01:17:12.686
There is much that remains unclear.
But yes. I suspect foul play.

01:17:14.371 --> 01:17:15.465
Marta?

01:17:15.663 --> 01:17:18.139
I have eliminated no suspects.

01:17:20.217 --> 01:17:23.505
You're full of shit, I don't trust
this guy in the tweed suit,

01:17:23.808 --> 01:17:26.194
and Alan, God bless you,
you're useless.

01:17:26.735 --> 01:17:27.864
Thank you.

01:17:27.864 --> 01:17:30.995
There's only one answer to this:
she has to renounce the inheritance.

01:17:30.995 --> 01:17:31.971
She knows that's what
she should do...

01:17:31.971 --> 01:17:33.994
That's exactly what she'll do.

01:17:36.224 --> 01:17:37.601
- Mom.
- She'll do it.

01:17:37.973 --> 01:17:40.857
If Granddad wanted to give Marta
everything, then that's what he wanted.

01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:44.310
No, this wasn't him.
He loved us.

01:17:44.454 --> 01:17:48.069
He wanted us taken care of.
He wanted you to have an education.

01:17:48.549 --> 01:17:52.185
Meg, you think I can pay
for your school?

01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:06.447
I know, just saying it it
sounds insane, but it's all true.

01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:09.087
And I think Blanc's been on to me
from the start.

01:18:09.247 --> 01:18:11.653
I don't care if I go to jail,
but my mom...

01:18:12.191 --> 01:18:14.749
My sister, we...

01:18:17.313 --> 01:18:19.142
Are you gonna say something?

01:18:20.387 --> 01:18:23.540
I always thought I was the only one
that could beat him at GO.

01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:26.431
I always thought
that meant something.

01:18:26.781 --> 01:18:28.743
Yeah, I know you did.

01:18:28.743 --> 01:18:33.283
In the night of the party, my last
conversation with him, our last argument.

01:18:33.283 --> 01:18:35.159
that's what he told me about you.

01:18:36.205 --> 01:18:38.710
That you beat him in GO
more than I do, and I thought...

01:18:41.204 --> 01:18:43.385
What a strange thing to tell me.

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:47.137
I think I get it now.

01:18:49.261 --> 01:18:51.305
It did mean something.

01:18:56.746 --> 01:18:58.588
I'm not gonna tell my family shit.

01:18:58.736 --> 01:19:01.767
You're not going to jail.
That detective is not gonna catch you.

01:19:02.873 --> 01:19:04.994
And you're not gonna
give up the money.

01:19:05.234 --> 01:19:08.393
This is was granddad wanted for you and me,
think about what he did to go through with this.

01:19:08.393 --> 01:19:11.059
He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.

01:19:12.066 --> 01:19:13.770
And he wanted it for you.

01:19:13.770 --> 01:19:18.011
You've come this far.
Let me help you go all the way.

01:19:18.179 --> 01:19:19.959
What's going on? This isn't you.

01:19:20.513 --> 01:19:24.866
You could just turn me in right now
and still get your cut of the inheritance. Why?

01:19:25.415 --> 01:19:27.355
Because fuck my family.

01:19:28.715 --> 01:19:31.542
I can help you get away
with this, and then...

01:19:32.522 --> 01:19:35.037
You're gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance.

01:19:36.511 --> 01:19:40.537
Happy ending. Everybody wins:
you, me, Harlan.

01:19:40.537 --> 01:19:42.193
Yeah.

01:19:42.918 --> 01:19:45.114
Deal?

01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:58.024
- Meg.
- Marta.

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:01.723
- That was nuts.
- I know.

01:20:02.111 --> 01:20:03.338
Are you okay?

01:20:04.835 --> 01:20:06.941
Yeah. Are you?

01:20:06.941 --> 01:20:08.345
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:20:09.984 --> 01:20:12.027
Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just...

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:13.668
I wanted to...

01:20:16.188 --> 01:20:18.934
I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.

01:20:20.244 --> 01:20:25.744
And... I guess I wanted to ask...
What are you gonna do?

01:20:28.646 --> 01:20:30.168
What do you mean?

01:20:30.168 --> 01:20:33.734
Well, the... with the will.
What are you gonna to do?

01:20:36.421 --> 01:20:38.326
What do you think I should do?

01:20:38.895 --> 01:20:43.510
You should do
whatever you think is right.

01:20:46.172 --> 01:20:47.927
Look, I...

01:20:49.544 --> 01:20:51.914
I think you should
give it back to us.

01:20:53.709 --> 01:20:56.950
Granddad always took
care of us, we're his family.

01:20:57.735 --> 01:21:01.338
I know he was like family to you,
but we're his actual family.

01:21:01.484 --> 01:21:02.569
Yeah.

01:21:03.578 --> 01:21:08.381
Marta, you know this isn't fair,
we've always been good to you,

01:21:08.381 --> 01:21:11.235
and you're like family
and we'll take care of you, but...

01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:15.734
You have to make things right.
You know what's right.

01:21:16.587 --> 01:21:17.940
Marta.

01:21:20.474 --> 01:21:24.468
Mom's broke, she says
I'm gonna have to drop out of school.

01:21:24.468 --> 01:21:26.153
No, no, Meg.

01:21:27.761 --> 01:21:29.550
Listen, I won't let that happen.

01:21:29.722 --> 01:21:33.152
Whatever money you need,
I'll give it to you. I'm here for you.

01:21:33.152 --> 01:21:34.977
And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:21:34.977 --> 01:21:38.635
- I promise that, okay?
- Thanks.

01:21:39.187 --> 01:21:40.748
And once I...

01:21:59.765 --> 01:22:01.312
Okay then.

01:22:01.805 --> 01:22:04.518
Did Blanc find anything
suspicious at the house?

01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:11.274
Yes, he found mud, upstairs,
where I broke in through the window.

01:22:12.009 --> 01:22:13.600
Identifiable prints?

01:22:13.987 --> 01:22:16.548
- No.
- Good, okay.

01:22:17.319 --> 01:22:19.158
Good. Hey.

01:22:19.158 --> 01:22:23.333
You lay low for a coupe of days.
Wait for this investigation to blow over, and it will.

01:22:23.333 --> 01:22:27.206
'Cause no matter how good that Blanc guy
thinks he is, he's got nothing.

01:22:27.378 --> 01:22:29.881
Hey, Relax.

01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:35.364
Marta get your ass up, what the hell is happening?
There's a guy here and a bunch of stuff.

01:22:35.364 --> 01:22:37.491
Everything's going crazy.
Are we rich?

01:22:38.879 --> 01:22:40.760
Maybe, Alice, I don't know.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.650
I don't even know what that means
but you better get your ass up.

01:22:44.433 --> 01:22:47.970
We don't know much about Marta Cabrera
or her exact relationship...

01:22:47.970 --> 01:22:51.482
Oh my God Marta.
What is all this. What did you do?

01:22:52.244 --> 01:22:54.496
- Is that here?
- Oh, yeah it is.

01:22:55.641 --> 01:22:58.592
Wait, so is that true?
Are we rich?

01:23:01.809 --> 01:23:03.191
Oh my God.

01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:19.611
Good Morning, Mrs. Thrombey.

01:23:24.734 --> 01:23:27.851
Why is grief the providence of youth?

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:30.777
I don't know.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:37.215
But I'd imagine that
age deepens all feelings.

01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:40.749
Including grief.

01:23:43.056 --> 01:23:50.134
This was a long walk to offering
condolences for the loss of your son.

01:23:51.242 --> 01:23:57.153
And asking you if it isn't presumptuous
of me not to think too harshly of your family.

01:23:58.264 --> 01:24:02.988
if I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.

01:24:04.245 --> 01:24:07.127
They're young, aren't they?

01:24:12.079 --> 01:24:17.575
One thing I assume of age
is weariness.

01:24:18.145 --> 01:24:20.955
Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.

01:24:21.490 --> 01:24:26.455
Tired of what I do.
Following arcs, like lobbed rocks.

01:24:26.632 --> 01:24:29.181
The inevitability of truth.

01:24:32.063 --> 01:24:37.130
But the complexity
and the gray lie not in the truth

01:24:38.376 --> 01:24:42.149
but what you do
with the truth once you have it.

01:24:49.061 --> 01:24:52.740
I think you have something
you wanna tell me.

01:24:53.815 --> 01:24:57.849
I think you're very perceptive
and very capable

01:24:57.849 --> 01:25:02.260
of telling me what you saw
the night of your son's party.

01:25:10.483 --> 01:25:14.644
But I'll happily wait.
I'm in no rush.

01:25:15.795 --> 01:25:20.758
In fact, I find it quite pleasant,
sitting here with you.

01:25:28.901 --> 01:25:31.353
Lawyers were here,
very big lawyers it looked like.

01:25:31.353 --> 01:25:33.864
They left all this stuff
and business cards,

01:25:33.864 --> 01:25:36.045
and there was a pile
of other stuff when I got home.

01:25:37.192 --> 01:25:39.339
I don't like any of this, Marta.

01:25:39.475 --> 01:25:41.147
I don't like it either.

01:25:41.335 --> 01:25:44.065
I'm slipping out the back.
I'll be back later.

01:25:44.065 --> 01:25:45.980
Please don't talk to anyone.

01:25:52.473 --> 01:25:53.814
Walt?

01:25:54.317 --> 01:25:58.454
Yeah, I came from...
Hey, how are you doing?

01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:03.828
Walt, I want you to know
that I didn't know about any of this.

01:26:03.828 --> 01:26:06.507
We know you didn't.
We know you didn't.

01:26:06.805 --> 01:26:09.847
Yeah, we all kinda went
a little crazy yesterday.

01:26:09.847 --> 01:26:11.832
- Understandable.
- Yeah.

01:26:13.228 --> 01:26:14.997
I haven't even looked
at all this yet.

01:26:14.997 --> 01:26:20.124
It must just be local lawyers and accountants
who saw the news and wanna get a jump on it.

01:26:20.878 --> 01:26:23.180
I'd be careful of all of it.

01:26:24.822 --> 01:26:29.094
Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?

01:26:32.210 --> 01:26:34.664
This is what Harlan wanted.

01:26:36.539 --> 01:26:40.902
Yeah, but, Harlan put you
in a very hard position here.

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:43.655
It was unfair of him.

01:26:44.603 --> 01:26:48.629
You see the kind of
press and the scrutiny that this kicks up?

01:26:49.221 --> 01:26:51.850
We know... with your mother.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.964
- My mother?
- Yeah.

01:27:00.425 --> 01:27:02.118
What did Meg tell you?

01:27:03.184 --> 01:27:04.703
This isn't about Meg.

01:27:06.398 --> 01:27:09.550
You're missing the point.
We don't wanna attack you with this.

01:27:10.098 --> 01:27:14.803
Marta, if your mother came into
the country illegally, criminally,

01:27:14.933 --> 01:27:18.889
and you come into this inheritance
with all the scrutiny that entails,

01:27:18.889 --> 01:27:23.256
I'd be afraid that could come to light.
That's what we wanna avoid here.

01:27:23.256 --> 01:27:28.231
We can protect you from
that happening, or if it happens.

01:27:28.553 --> 01:27:32.416
So, you're saying that
even if it came to light.

01:27:33.493 --> 01:27:35.839
With your family's resources
you could help me fix it.

01:27:35.839 --> 01:27:40.746
Yeah, with the right lawyers,
you know, not these local guys,

01:27:40.746 --> 01:27:43.418
but New York lawyers,
DC lawyers.

01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.681
With enough resources
put toward it, yes.

01:27:45.681 --> 01:27:50.334
Not that that ever even needs
to come up. But yes.

01:27:52.169 --> 01:27:53.723
Okay. Good.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.579
Okay?

01:27:57.614 --> 01:28:00.897
'Cause Harlan gave
me all your resources.

01:28:01.468 --> 01:28:04.317
So, that means with my resources
I'll be able to fix it.

01:28:04.317 --> 01:28:06.672
So, I guess I will find
the right lawyers.

01:28:07.201 --> 01:28:08.701
Marta, that's...

01:28:10.591 --> 01:28:12.652
Better be sure if that's

01:28:13.625 --> 01:28:15.473
what you want.

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.774
I don't know. What's this?

01:28:54.774 --> 01:28:58.916
It's my medical bag tag.
They have my medical bag, for some reason.

01:28:59.157 --> 01:29:04.079
Okay, but this is a photocopy of just the header
of a blood toxicology report on Harlan.

01:29:04.259 --> 01:29:06.460
Marta, this is gonna show
the morphine overdose.

01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:11.899
So I'm screwed!

01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:14.695
How do you know all this stuff?

01:29:14.695 --> 01:29:17.190
I was Harlan's
research assistant for a summer.

01:29:18.243 --> 01:29:20.438
But what kind of blackmail
scheme is this?

01:29:20.524 --> 01:29:23.751
I mean the actual evidence
is sitting up the street at the crime lab.

01:29:23.751 --> 01:29:26.328
There are no demands,
there's no meeting place.

01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:30.517
What's the point
of sending you this?

01:29:40.657 --> 01:29:42.779
Could be a half hour.
Could be an hour.

01:29:42.779 --> 01:29:44.431
We wanna make sure...

01:29:53.268 --> 01:29:55.356
- What's the cheese?
- Hey.

01:29:55.356 --> 01:29:56.820
- Thank you.
- No problem.

01:29:57.494 --> 01:30:00.473
5 AM, security systems
here were all triggered.

01:30:00.712 --> 01:30:02.125
This thing went up really quick.

01:30:02.125 --> 01:30:06.395
So that means blood stores, records,
anything of that nature, it's all gone.

01:30:06.575 --> 01:30:09.680
There were no employees here,
so thank God for that.

01:30:10.719 --> 01:30:13.776
- What about security cameras?
- Oh yeah.

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:19.576
Speaking of security, the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate

01:30:19.576 --> 01:30:21.943
was all scrambled for some reason.

01:30:24.199 --> 01:30:26.362
What's still pending
from the autopsy?

01:30:26.843 --> 01:30:28.667
Just the report on the blood work.

01:30:30.013 --> 01:30:31.739
Blood work?

01:30:36.068 --> 01:30:38.150
Holy shit!

01:30:41.096 --> 01:30:43.054
This is insane!

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:47.871
I mean who would blow up
the whole real building just to blackmail me?

01:30:47.871 --> 01:30:50.289
Marta this means that the blackmailer
has the only paper copy

01:30:50.289 --> 01:30:51.965
of the thing
that can prove your guilt.

01:30:51.965 --> 01:30:55.248
You didn't get any other instructions,
no phone call, no email, nothing?

01:30:57.405 --> 01:30:59.173
I haven't checked my email.

01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:06.183
There is one.

01:31:06.183 --> 01:31:10.175
That's it. 1209 Columbus Road, 10 AM.

01:31:15.671 --> 01:31:16.891
You know what this means, right?

01:31:16.891 --> 01:31:20.890
If you destroy that copy
you are totally in the clear.

01:31:20.895 --> 01:31:22.347
Oh no!

01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:26.311
Marta, did you hear me?

01:31:27.421 --> 01:31:28.934
Yeah.

01:31:36.766 --> 01:31:39.271
Elliott!
We gotta go! We gotta go!

01:31:42.368 --> 01:31:43.298
Okay, Baby Driver.

01:31:43.306 --> 01:31:45.721
Oh God! You regret helping me yet?

01:31:45.721 --> 01:31:47.970
I regret not taking the beamer.

01:31:49.706 --> 01:31:51.522
Oh shit!

01:32:04.642 --> 01:32:06.447
Vehicles in pursuit in
Washington Street.

01:32:06.447 --> 01:32:08.080
- Make sure you say "No force."
- No force.

01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:10.971
- We got a possible murder suspect.
- I said that, I said that.

01:32:12.534 --> 01:32:14.623
Go! Go!
Are you flooring it?

01:32:14.623 --> 01:32:16.702
I am literally flooring it.

01:32:27.369 --> 01:32:29.089
- This is going well.
- I'm pulling over.

01:32:29.089 --> 01:32:32.375
If you miss your chance
to get this tox report it's all over.

01:32:32.375 --> 01:32:33.881
Oh my God!

01:32:38.688 --> 01:32:39.858
Why are we stopping?

01:32:39.858 --> 01:32:42.376
Why are you stopping
in the middle of the road?

01:32:55.496 --> 01:32:56.820
Hold on!

01:33:20.521 --> 01:33:24.559
Oh my God. I'm just pure adrenaline
right now, I feel like I swallowed bees.

01:33:24.878 --> 01:33:27.122
Okay, so, what is it?
What's the address?

01:33:27.122 --> 01:33:29.056
- 1209 Columbus road.
- Okay.

01:33:29.544 --> 01:33:31.699
I mean, whatever they want,
I'll say yes because...

01:33:31.875 --> 01:33:33.364
You know, just to get
that report back.

01:33:33.364 --> 01:33:35.404
- Get it back and destroy it.
- Destroy it.

01:33:35.894 --> 01:33:37.698
Holy shit! Ransom.

01:33:38.581 --> 01:33:42.138
Thank you. I couldn't
do this without you.

01:33:45.953 --> 01:33:47.372
Oh my God!

01:33:48.569 --> 01:33:50.109
Get out!

01:33:51.352 --> 01:33:54.428
That was the dumbest
car chase of all time.

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:55.605
Put your hands down.

01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:58.268
I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey,
Greatnana.

01:33:58.776 --> 01:34:02.357
The night of the party she saw someone
climbing the trellis to the third floor.

01:34:02.928 --> 01:34:05.140
Mr. Drysdale, come on.

01:34:05.848 --> 01:34:07.448
Pat him down, check him out.

01:34:07.448 --> 01:34:09.188
What's going on?

01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:11.195
"Ransom came back" she said.

01:34:12.135 --> 01:34:14.890
I don't know what he came back to do,
but we'll find out.

01:34:14.983 --> 01:34:16.182
You have anything sharp?

01:34:17.219 --> 01:34:19.886
- Watch your head. Thank you.
- You don't need to thank him.

01:34:19.886 --> 01:34:23.569
Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?

01:34:24.883 --> 01:34:26.429
Yes.

01:34:33.716 --> 01:34:35.127
Blanc, you're coming with us?

01:34:35.127 --> 01:34:36.595
I'll drive with Marta.

01:34:37.322 --> 01:34:39.162
Let's go to the police station.

01:34:39.162 --> 01:34:42.274
I wanna full run down
on everything he said to you.

01:34:42.462 --> 01:34:44.547
And I'll can catch you up
on where we're at.

01:34:51.412 --> 01:34:54.063
Strange case from the start.

01:34:55.301 --> 01:34:58.318
A case with a hole in the middle.

01:35:00.251 --> 01:35:01.782
A donut?

01:35:02.683 --> 01:35:06.649
I'm just talking through my process here,
let me know if this is boring.

01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:12.180
I feel the noose tightening,
the family is truly desperate.

01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:14.565
Desperate motives.

01:35:15.139 --> 01:35:21.498
Then mystery of who hired me,
the impossibility of the crime, and yet...

01:35:22.588 --> 01:35:30.191
A donut! One central piece,
and if it reveals itself the fog would lift,

01:35:30.662 --> 01:35:34.175
the arc would resolve,
the slinky become unkinked.

01:35:34.175 --> 01:35:36.268
Do you mind
if I stop for a second?

01:35:36.439 --> 01:35:39.525
I need to pick something up.
It will be very quick.

01:35:40.857 --> 01:35:42.221
Sure.

01:35:55.432 --> 01:35:56.705
It'll be just a few minutes.

01:35:56.705 --> 01:35:59.470
I'll watch the door.

01:36:22.497 --> 01:36:24.461
Hello?

01:36:47.174 --> 01:36:48.971
Listen, I don't know what you want.

01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:53.805
Whatever it is we can work it out.

01:36:53.805 --> 01:36:56.292
But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.

01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:58.308
And I'm leaving with that report.

01:37:02.857 --> 01:37:04.522
Hello?

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:31.246
Fran?

01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:42.578
No, no, no! Fran.

01:37:45.475 --> 01:37:48.955
Can you hear me?
Fran, give me a sign if you can hear me.

01:37:48.955 --> 01:37:49.914
You.

01:37:49.914 --> 01:37:51.601
Yes, it's me, it's Marta.

01:37:51.601 --> 01:37:54.209
You called me here, you sent
me an email, that's why I'm here.

01:37:54.209 --> 01:37:55.402
Did you take something?

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:58.020
I'm gonna call an ambulance now
and you're going to be okay.

01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.968
You gonna be fine, okay?
Stay with me.

01:38:00.338 --> 01:38:01.291
What?

01:38:01.291 --> 01:38:02.612
Help me.

01:38:03.339 --> 01:38:04.593
- Stashed.
- What?

01:38:04.593 --> 01:38:06.433
What are you saying?

01:38:07.009 --> 01:38:09.201
You did this!

01:38:09.201 --> 01:38:11.292
You won't get away with this!

01:38:11.292 --> 01:38:13.388
Jesus! Stop!

01:38:34.951 --> 01:38:37.243

Oh lord.

All right my friend,
thank you for the update.

01:39:04.091 --> 01:39:08.567
No need for that, I'll bring her in
once we get word that the housekeeper is stable.

01:39:08.567 --> 01:39:11.633
It's still touch and go. All right.

01:39:13.177 --> 01:39:15.991
This is over.
People are getting hurt.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:19.442
So, I'm gonna tell you
the truth.

01:39:19.442 --> 01:39:23.616
Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.

01:39:23.823 --> 01:39:26.966
Good. Wait, I hope
he didn't cover for me.

01:39:26.966 --> 01:39:29.593
Did he tell the real truth
about me switching the...

01:39:29.593 --> 01:39:30.425
Yeah.

01:39:30.425 --> 01:39:32.523
- And the disguise...
- Yes.

01:39:32.523 --> 01:39:34.233
And the whole blackmailing...

01:39:35.042 --> 01:39:37.199
But why did Fran take my morphine?

01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.626
Obviously, she had swiped
a bag from the house,

01:39:39.626 --> 01:39:43.770
but she didn't seem like a user to me,
unless that's why she needed the blackmail money...

01:39:44.049 --> 01:39:46.062
I don't know,
it doesn't matter anyway.

01:39:46.427 --> 01:39:49.401
I have to tell the Thrombeys myself,
I feel like I owe that to them.

01:39:49.401 --> 01:39:50.570
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:39:50.570 --> 01:39:52.745
No, I have to do it!
I need to do it!

01:39:55.012 --> 01:39:58.183
I gave the doctors my number,
so they'll call if anything changes with Fran.

01:39:58.183 --> 01:39:59.308
All right.

01:39:59.308 --> 01:40:02.578
We'll round up the Thrombeys
at the house, along with a police escort.

01:40:03.147 --> 01:40:05.342
For the arrest after.

01:40:05.536 --> 01:40:08.561
You can tell me your whole
story on the drive over.

01:40:09.093 --> 01:40:11.410
I don't want any more surprises.

01:40:26.826 --> 01:40:29.111
Fran said it was stashed, the copy,

01:40:29.277 --> 01:40:33.243
and then she said,
"you did this, you won't get away with it."

01:40:34.650 --> 01:40:37.761
I called the ambulance. That's it.

01:40:38.912 --> 01:40:40.283
All right.

01:40:42.039 --> 01:40:43.888
You ready?

01:40:50.551 --> 01:40:53.805
Okay, has she come
to her senses?

01:40:54.028 --> 01:40:56.263
She's standing right there Richard,
she can speak for herself.

01:40:56.263 --> 01:40:57.841
Is the rest of the family here?

01:40:57.841 --> 01:40:59.743
- In the living room.
- I think it would be better if we were

01:40:59.743 --> 01:41:02.349
to gather together
and get this over with.

01:41:07.856 --> 01:41:09.691
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:13.374
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry I told them
about your mom.

01:41:13.374 --> 01:41:15.254
Meg, it's okay.

01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:18.664
I'm sorry. No, I was scared, I just,
I didn't wanna tell them...

01:41:18.664 --> 01:41:21.395
I get it. Trust me.

01:41:22.489 --> 01:41:24.745
I understand. It's all right.

01:41:25.743 --> 01:41:27.445
I'm sorry.

01:41:29.849 --> 01:41:32.521
God, I'm so raiding Fran's
stash after this.

01:41:32.713 --> 01:41:37.984
I still think this is a bad idea,
but the family is assembled.

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:43.725
I know where the tox report is.

01:41:50.662 --> 01:41:52.551
She basically told me where it was.

01:41:55.049 --> 01:41:57.218
Anyway this will tie everything up.

01:41:59.093 --> 01:42:01.176
And I just handed it to you.

01:42:02.178 --> 01:42:04.930
God, you're not much
of a detective, are you?

01:42:05.712 --> 01:42:07.218
To be fair.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:11.689
You make a pretty lousy murderer.

01:42:13.102 --> 01:42:15.531
Perhaps we deserve each other.

01:42:26.968 --> 01:42:29.493
You've always been good to me.

01:42:30.964 --> 01:42:34.653
What I'm about to say isn't gonna be easy
and you're gonna be upset.

01:42:35.287 --> 01:42:38.698
But I thought after what
you've gone through the last few days,

01:42:39.444 --> 01:42:42.466
that you deserved
to hear it from me.

01:42:44.684 --> 01:42:45.144
I...

01:42:45.144 --> 01:42:46.582
Excuse me!

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.980
You have not been
good to her.

01:42:53.526 --> 01:42:57.517
You have all treated her like shit
to steal back a fortune

01:42:57.517 --> 01:42:59.731
that you lost and she deserves.

01:42:59.891 --> 01:43:02.916
You're a pack of vultures
at the feast.

01:43:02.916 --> 01:43:05.116
Nose all beak's bloody.

01:43:05.116 --> 01:43:09.662
Well, you're not getting
bailed out, not this time.

01:43:10.422 --> 01:43:15.043
Ms. Cabrera has decided definitively
not to renounce the inheritance.

01:43:15.043 --> 01:43:15.940
What?

01:43:16.296 --> 01:43:16.875
What?

01:43:16.875 --> 01:43:21.118
Furthermore, it will be my professional
recommendation to the local authorities

01:43:21.118 --> 01:43:23.723
that the manner of death
in the case of Harlan Thrombey

01:43:23.723 --> 01:43:27.752
is ruled as suicide,
and the case is closed.

01:43:27.752 --> 01:43:28.769
- Blanc.
- What?

01:43:28.769 --> 01:43:30.507
Thank you all for coming.
Goodbye.

01:43:30.507 --> 01:43:31.746
What's going on?

01:43:31.746 --> 01:43:33.097
Just tell me what's...

01:43:34.381 --> 01:43:37.065
That's certainly not
what I was expecting.

01:43:38.001 --> 01:43:39.120
Is anybody else confused?

01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:41.454
Not what I was
expecting to hear at all.

01:43:44.294 --> 01:43:45.798
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:43:45.798 --> 01:43:46.681
Yes.

01:43:46.681 --> 01:43:48.837
I just wanna come clean, okay?

01:43:48.837 --> 01:43:50.107
- It's over.
- Almost.

01:43:50.107 --> 01:43:51.441
Blanc, what are we doing?

01:43:51.441 --> 01:43:53.755
I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.

01:43:54.212 --> 01:43:57.162
Keep the family out of this room,
get them out of the house if you can.

01:43:57.162 --> 01:43:59.419
But stand by
with your additional officer.

01:43:59.419 --> 01:44:01.643
- Get the family out?
- Yes, but not all of them.

01:44:03.233 --> 01:44:03.891
Blanc.

01:44:03.891 --> 01:44:05.024
- Yes, sir.
- Come on. Come on.

01:44:05.024 --> 01:44:06.073
What's with all this drama?

01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:07.133
Indulge me.

01:44:07.133 --> 01:44:10.911
Blanc. I told Ransom, Ransom told
you, I'm telling you now -

01:44:11.530 --> 01:44:14.263
it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.

01:44:14.263 --> 01:44:17.528
Yes, you did. Yes, he did.
Yes, you are, but. But.

01:44:18.092 --> 01:44:21.947
I spoke in the car about the hole
at the center of this donut.

01:44:22.465 --> 01:44:26.309
And what you and Harlan did that fateful
night seems at first glance

01:44:26.309 --> 01:44:28.177
to fill that hole perfectly.

01:44:28.332 --> 01:44:30.898
A donut hole in a donut's hole.

01:44:31.742 --> 01:44:33.780
But we must look a little closer.

01:44:34.469 --> 01:44:39.536
And when we do, we see that
the donut hole has a hole in its center.

01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:44.721
It is not a donut hole, but a smaller
donut with its own hole,

01:44:44.874 --> 01:44:47.729
and our donut is not holed at all!

01:44:47.729 --> 01:44:50.020
Blanc, look, I understand that
this is amusing for you.

01:44:50.020 --> 01:44:54.643
Why was I hired?
Why would someone hire me?

01:44:54.643 --> 01:44:57.216
Someone fishing for a crime
to reverse the will, Blanc.

01:44:57.216 --> 01:44:59.687
I was hired before
the sealed will was read.

01:45:00.073 --> 01:45:04.017
So yes, the person must have
known the contents of the will.

01:45:04.632 --> 01:45:08.982
But one step further - that same person
must have known a crime was committed,

01:45:08.982 --> 01:45:10.249
and further,

01:45:10.787 --> 01:45:14.836
if the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,

01:45:15.744 --> 01:45:18.357
they must've known
that Marta was responsible.

01:45:19.061 --> 01:45:23.077
An intriguing combination of factors.
Someone who knew what Marta did,

01:45:23.077 --> 01:45:26.524
wanted to expose it,
but could not reveal how they knew.

01:45:26.686 --> 01:45:30.743
Fran! She was blackmailing me,
she knew what I did.

01:45:30.893 --> 01:45:34.855
But Fran wanted money,
ergo she did not want the crime exposed.

01:45:34.855 --> 01:45:37.681
Did someone in the family observe Marta
doing something suspicious?

01:45:37.681 --> 01:45:40.831
But they would've had no reason
not to speak up.

01:45:42.908 --> 01:45:45.805
The answer is not so simple.

01:45:46.674 --> 01:45:50.936
Now with the entire solution
in my field of view.

01:45:50.936 --> 01:45:54.155
The arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.

01:45:56.544 --> 01:45:58.967
And Marta, it will not be easy
for you to hear.

01:45:59.573 --> 01:46:05.294
But there is at least one
truly guilty party behind it all,

01:46:05.294 --> 01:46:08.377
guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice,

01:46:08.884 --> 01:46:11.807
committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.

01:46:14.779 --> 01:46:16.335
Trooper Wagner.

01:46:16.335 --> 01:46:17.924
Trooper Wagner?

01:46:19.135 --> 01:46:20.522
No.

01:46:22.048 --> 01:46:25.870
Marta, I'm so sorry. I told them everything,
I figured it was up. I'm sorry.

01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:28.160
It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:30.394
Not exactly everything though.

01:46:30.795 --> 01:46:32.792
Is this about what
Greatnana told you?

01:46:33.090 --> 01:46:36.215
She saw me that night,
she mistook me for Ransom.

01:46:36.215 --> 01:46:38.707
We'll get to that.
In the meanwhile,

01:46:39.186 --> 01:46:41.604
Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,

01:46:41.941 --> 01:46:46.007
you might tell us all
why you hired me?

01:46:49.222 --> 01:46:50.834
Why I hired you?

01:46:51.336 --> 01:46:54.949
You're right, let's back up.
To the night of the party.

01:46:55.059 --> 01:46:57.158
Your argument with Harlan.

01:46:57.608 --> 01:47:01.980
What were the overheard words
by the Nazi child, masturbating in the bathroom?

01:47:02.206 --> 01:47:05.329
"my will" and
"I'm warning you."

01:47:05.859 --> 01:47:11.527
You and Harlan were "drama mamas," you shared
a love of twisting the knife into one another.

01:47:11.549 --> 01:47:15.467
You see, I don't believe he would've
slipped it in halfway - no, no, no.

01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:20.474
I submit Harlan told you everything.

01:47:20.596 --> 01:47:21.956
You can't be serious!

01:47:21.956 --> 01:47:27.999
Not a red dime or word of my work
to a single one of them, you included.

01:47:28.508 --> 01:47:34.001
Marta, remind me what Ransom said
his conversation with Harlan ended with.

01:47:34.547 --> 01:47:37.033
Harlan told him that I could beat
him at GO.

01:47:37.033 --> 01:47:39.961
And I asked myself - Marta?

01:47:40.328 --> 01:47:44.382
How would the topic of the will
have steered around to Marta?

01:47:45.822 --> 01:47:49.048
There is one obvious explanation.

01:47:49.159 --> 01:47:52.047
You can't be that crazy, you're not
just gonna throw away your fortune.

01:47:52.047 --> 01:47:55.319
No. I'm giving it to Marta.
All of it.

01:47:56.616 --> 01:47:59.318
Your Brazilian nurse?
Are you goddamn insane?

01:47:59.318 --> 01:48:03.585
I am sane for the first time
in my life and I've done it.

01:48:04.294 --> 01:48:07.237
I've made the change
to my will, it's done.

01:48:07.535 --> 01:48:08.818
I'm warning you!

01:48:09.756 --> 01:48:11.993
That's some heavy duty conjecture.

01:48:12.043 --> 01:48:13.479
Granted.

01:48:13.681 --> 01:48:17.149
But it is the only way of
what comes next makes sense.

01:48:17.542 --> 01:48:21.103
So, you storm out,
you drive off into the night.

01:48:21.862 --> 01:48:26.170
You tell Marta later of, what was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...

01:48:26.351 --> 01:48:30.856
Clarity. That he has to make do
for himself from here on out.

01:48:31.181 --> 01:48:32.740
Exactly!

01:48:35.379 --> 01:48:39.801
Marta. The will. Harlan.
Do for yourself.

01:48:39.801 --> 01:48:42.060
"You won't get away with this."

01:48:42.562 --> 01:48:44.593
And a plan forms.

01:48:53.051 --> 01:48:57.491
You return, careful to avoid the
gate's security camera range.

01:48:57.641 --> 01:48:59.906
Then on foot up towards the house.

01:49:00.045 --> 01:49:04.354
You sneak in, up the trellis so as
not to be seen by the rest of the family,

01:49:04.354 --> 01:49:07.031
who are still having their
party downstairs.

01:49:08.956 --> 01:49:12.323
What you need to do
will take moments.

01:49:12.898 --> 01:49:17.004
But it is essential that
you are alone and undetected.

01:49:17.312 --> 01:49:19.768
You knew what medications Harlan took.

01:49:19.768 --> 01:49:22.540
You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.

01:49:23.858 --> 01:49:31.203
And you knew if Marta was responsible
for his death, even unintentionally,

01:49:32.028 --> 01:49:37.624
the slayer rule would nullify the changed will,
and you would get your share back.

01:49:38.533 --> 01:49:42.901
You use the syringes in the kit to switch
the liquids in the two medication vials.

01:49:42.901 --> 01:49:45.872
And, as a final precaution,

01:49:47.794 --> 01:49:53.022
you took the Naloxone,
the life saving antidote.

01:49:53.421 --> 01:49:55.647
No, no. That's impossible.

01:49:55.873 --> 01:49:57.316
It is the truth.

01:49:57.487 --> 01:50:00.042
Hand me that vial of morphine,
I'll show you.

01:50:00.042 --> 01:50:05.029
If he did that, if the meds were switched,
then when I got them mixed up...

01:50:07.134 --> 01:50:09.791
I accidentally switched them back.

01:50:10.687 --> 01:50:11.861
I gave Harlan...

01:50:11.861 --> 01:50:13.600
The correct doses.

01:50:13.919 --> 01:50:15.515
Yes.

01:50:17.585 --> 01:50:19.571
But not accidentally.

01:50:20.574 --> 01:50:24.169
I taped over the labels
of these two vials.

01:50:25.046 --> 01:50:28.083
The vials themselves are identical.

01:50:30.405 --> 01:50:32.638
How'd you know
that this was the morphine?

01:50:33.073 --> 01:50:34.523
I just knew.

01:50:34.523 --> 01:50:37.691
You knew because there is the slightest,
almost imperceptible difference

01:50:37.691 --> 01:50:40.281
of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.

01:50:42.226 --> 01:50:45.763
You knew because you'd done it
a hundred times.

01:50:46.717 --> 01:50:52.360
You gave him the correct medication
because you are a good nurse.

01:50:53.285 --> 01:50:54.242
Then Harlan was...

01:50:54.242 --> 01:50:56.889
I'm sorry Marta, but yes.

01:50:57.969 --> 01:51:00.185
Harlan was perfectly fine.

01:51:01.004 --> 01:51:02.876
His blood was normal.

01:51:03.409 --> 01:51:09.336
The cause of death was truly,
solely suicide, and you are guilty of nothing

01:51:09.336 --> 01:51:12.354
but some damage to the trellis
and a few amateur theatrics.

01:51:13.237 --> 01:51:17.858
In fact, if Harlan had listened to you
and called the ambulance,

01:51:19.368 --> 01:51:21.871
he would be alive today.

01:51:24.289 --> 01:51:25.880
Hot damn.

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:27.687
A twisted web.

01:51:28.607 --> 01:51:32.093
And we are not finished
untangling it. Not yet.

01:51:32.766 --> 01:51:37.006
Marta, when Greatnana spotted you
climbing down the trellis she said,

01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:41.973
Ransom? Are you back again already?

01:51:41.973 --> 01:51:46.373
<i>"Are you back again already?"
'Cause earlier that night</i>

01:51:49.426 --> 01:51:51.990
Ransom, you're back!

01:51:54.131 --> 01:51:55.518
Come on, Marta.

01:51:55.518 --> 01:51:59.116
This is stoopid with two o's.
You don't have a shred of evidence,

01:51:59.116 --> 01:52:00.418
You're just spinning a fairy tale.

01:52:00.418 --> 01:52:02.299
Not a shred, no.

01:52:02.474 --> 01:52:05.656
Just as we have no real proof
of Marta's mixing up the vials.

01:52:05.656 --> 01:52:08.290
- so it's your word against.
- You have her confession!

01:52:10.949 --> 01:52:14.396
All right, yeah.
Yeah, we do have that.

01:52:14.396 --> 01:52:17.041
With your permission,
I'd like to spin a little further.

01:52:17.710 --> 01:52:20.406
Much later that night you'd have
to come back to the house

01:52:20.406 --> 01:52:22.908
to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.

01:52:23.228 --> 01:52:26.653
However, this time
the dogs were outside.

01:52:28.996 --> 01:52:31.126
They barked waking Meg.

01:52:31.126 --> 01:52:33.951
No matter.
You'll get the vials tomorrow.

01:52:34.405 --> 01:52:38.747
But tomorrow brings news,
not of a medical error and guilty nurse,

01:52:38.747 --> 01:52:41.718
but of a slit throat and suicide.

01:52:45.851 --> 01:52:50.809
Now the circumstances are perfect
for the anonymous hiring of a me:

01:52:51.324 --> 01:52:53.474
you know a crime has been committed
by Ms. Cabrera,

01:52:53.474 --> 01:52:58.026
you need her to be caught for it,
you cannot reveal how you know.

01:52:59.793 --> 01:53:02.308
Enter Benoit Blanc.

01:53:02.770 --> 01:53:05.593
Benny, look I hear
what you are saying, it's just...

01:53:06.439 --> 01:53:08.479
The body is discovered
early the next morning.

01:53:08.479 --> 01:53:13.226
The police, the medical examiners,
the family, everyone swarms in,

01:53:13.226 --> 01:53:18.217
and there is no possible way you can get
to Marta's medical bag to retrieve the vials.

01:53:18.398 --> 01:53:21.560
You must wait for your moment
when the investigation is over

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:24.572
and you know
the house will be empty.

01:53:25.176 --> 01:53:28.839
That is why you missed the funeral.

01:53:30.005 --> 01:53:33.729
There is no one home to wonder
why you're going into Harlan's study.

01:53:34.965 --> 01:53:36.619
Or so you think.

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:45.203
Poor Fran. She witnessed you tampering
with Harlan's medication in the medical bag.

01:53:45.253 --> 01:53:48.657
She did not know
what you were doing.

01:53:48.987 --> 01:53:53.762
But she knew you were up to no good,
so her mind begins to turn.

01:53:53.762 --> 01:53:58.448
Oh God, that Hallmark movie
she told me about, with Danica McKellar.

01:53:58.622 --> 01:53:59.889
"Deadly By Surprise."

01:53:59.889 --> 01:54:01.398
That's what she
was talking about.

01:54:01.548 --> 01:54:04.667
She loved Harlan. She hates Ransom.

01:54:05.113 --> 01:54:09.149
So the poor girl decides to test her theory
and make this asshole pay.

01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:15.741
She gets a copy of the toxicology report,
I will be honest I have no idea how.

01:54:15.741 --> 01:54:17.580
'Cause she has a cousin.

01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:21.424
She told me, she has a cousin who works
as a receptionist at the examiners office.

01:54:21.424 --> 01:54:22.906
Well, Voilà!

01:54:22.906 --> 01:54:25.676
The numbers, they mean
nothing to her,

01:54:25.676 --> 01:54:29.356
but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat,

01:54:29.356 --> 01:54:32.913
so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.

01:54:33.619 --> 01:54:35.163
So, why did she send it to me?

01:54:35.163 --> 01:54:38.503
She didn't. She sent it to Ransom.

01:54:43.596 --> 01:54:47.744
And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,
what is his reaction?

01:54:48.264 --> 01:54:53.145
Elation! He still thinks Marta has
given Harlan the tampered drugs!

01:54:53.145 --> 01:54:55.826
A blood tox report
will prove her guilt.

01:54:55.997 --> 01:55:00.997
He goes to the will reading in high spirits,
ready to see the family tear itself apart,

01:55:00.997 --> 01:55:06.476
secure in the knowledge it will all be undone
when the tox report comes to light.

01:55:07.409 --> 01:55:09.146
And then...

01:55:09.998 --> 01:55:11.986
Marta's confession.

01:55:12.381 --> 01:55:14.871
And everything turns on its head.

01:55:14.871 --> 01:55:19.223
Now he realizes that Marta
has committed no crime,

01:55:19.223 --> 01:55:23.002
and the tox report
will prove her innocence.

01:55:23.315 --> 01:55:27.584
The changed will is gonna stand.
He has lost.

01:55:29.372 --> 01:55:30.975
Unless...

01:55:31.536 --> 01:55:33.305
Unless you decide.

01:55:33.305 --> 01:55:34.583
You're not gonna
give up the money.

01:55:34.583 --> 01:55:36.612
You're not gonna
give up the money.

01:55:36.671 --> 01:55:39.309
- You've come this far!
- You've come this far!

01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:42.557
Just one step further.

01:55:42.746 --> 01:55:47.837
Just one last act,
in for a penny, in for a pound.

01:55:50.453 --> 01:55:52.649
You decide. You are in.

01:55:57.444 --> 01:56:02.769
Step one: destroy all evidence
of Marta's innocence.

01:56:09.247 --> 01:56:15.263
Step two: send her the anonymous email
with a late morning rendezvous time,

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:21.953
and deliver her the blackmail note.

01:56:24.298 --> 01:56:28.820
Step three: keep your appointment
with Fran.

01:56:30.636 --> 01:56:34.966
I knew it! I knew you were
a no good son of a bitch!

01:56:35.304 --> 01:56:37.179
I knew Harlan wouldn't
just kill himself.

01:56:37.534 --> 01:56:39.186
Yes, Fran, you are right.

01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:43.794
I knew you were guilty as shit.
And now you're gonna pay for it!

01:56:44.134 --> 01:56:45.600
Don't you come near me!

01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:47.582
Don't come near me,
I'm warning you!

01:56:58.350 --> 01:57:01.947
Now the board is set.
Marta will get the blackmail note.

01:57:01.947 --> 01:57:03.916
You'll put the pieces together for her.

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:06.092
You'll guide her to the rendezvous.

01:57:06.246 --> 01:57:08.204
You'll make an anonymous call
to the police.

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:11.296
They will catch her there
with the body and the burned evidence.

01:57:11.296 --> 01:57:15.287
Marta will get arrested
for killing Fran and Harlan.

01:57:16.823 --> 01:57:17.671
She said:

01:57:17.671 --> 01:57:19.378
You did this!

01:57:20.324 --> 01:57:26.247
<i>She didn't say "you did this,"
she wasn't talking about me, she said,</i>

01:57:26.247 --> 01:57:28.648
Hugh did this.

01:57:28.648 --> 01:57:32.899
Hugh did this, 'cause you made
the help call you Hugh.

01:57:34.289 --> 01:57:36.155
'Cause you're an asshole.

01:57:36.971 --> 01:57:38.928
It would have worked.

01:57:39.295 --> 01:57:43.899
If we hadn't have brought you in for questioning,
so you could not make your anonymous call.

01:57:43.899 --> 01:57:47.954
And if Fran had not stashed
a safety copy of the tox report.

01:57:48.464 --> 01:57:52.405
And if Marta had not outplayed you
once again,

01:57:53.471 --> 01:57:55.458
by having a kind heart.

01:57:57.384 --> 01:57:59.627
By saving Fran's life,

01:57:59.964 --> 01:58:03.225
though it meant her losing the inheritance
and going to jail.

01:58:03.225 --> 01:58:08.324
She didn't play your game,
she saved Fran's life.

01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:13.030
Fran's alive?

01:58:13.379 --> 01:58:14.788
Oh yes.

01:58:14.788 --> 01:58:21.734
Fran, who will confirm this
fairy story or something close to it.

01:58:22.655 --> 01:58:27.692
And send you, Hugh, to jail.

01:58:32.383 --> 01:58:34.009
Yes.

01:58:36.857 --> 01:58:41.585
Doctor, that's great news.
We'll be there soon. Thank you.

01:58:46.232 --> 01:58:49.129
She's okay. She's ready to talk.

01:58:49.582 --> 01:58:52.985
Trooper Wagner, if you could
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody

01:58:52.985 --> 01:58:55.460
while Lieutenant Elliott,
Ms. Cabrera and myself

01:58:55.572 --> 01:58:57.724
we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.

01:58:57.724 --> 01:58:59.609
All right. Up. Come on.

01:59:05.434 --> 01:59:07.176
I'm gonna say this just to you.

01:59:07.533 --> 01:59:10.725
No cameras, no courtroom, just to you
because you know it's the truth.

01:59:11.554 --> 01:59:13.437
We allowed you into our home.

01:59:13.437 --> 01:59:16.749
We let you watch our granddad,
we welcomed you into our family.

01:59:16.749 --> 01:59:18.977
And now you think
you can steal it from us?

01:59:18.977 --> 01:59:23.308
You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home, our birthright,

01:59:24.164 --> 01:59:26.858
our ancestral family home?

01:59:29.019 --> 01:59:30.208
That is hooey!

01:59:30.619 --> 01:59:34.326
Harlan, he bought this place in the 80s
from a Pakistani real estate billionaire.

01:59:34.326 --> 01:59:36.245
Oh, shut up Blanc! Shut up!

01:59:36.245 --> 01:59:41.096
Shut up with that Kentucky fried
fog horn rag-horn drawl.

01:59:41.461 --> 01:59:45.064
Yeah, I killed Fran, but I guess I didn't.
So what do you have on me?

01:59:45.228 --> 01:59:47.114
Nothing. What?
Attempted murder?

01:59:47.114 --> 01:59:50.554
I get arson for the building, and a few
other charges, with a good lawyer,

01:59:50.554 --> 01:59:53.397
which I have,
I'll be out in no time.

01:59:53.397 --> 01:59:59.533
And then you'll see just how much hell
I can wreak on your life, you vicious little bitch.

02:00:07.037 --> 02:00:08.542
What the shit!?

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:12.618
- That means she's lying!
- Yeah, man, we know.

02:00:12.618 --> 02:00:16.080
That's right, Fran's dead.

02:00:20.063 --> 02:00:22.448
And you just confessed to her murder.

02:00:34.930 --> 02:00:36.307
Well...

02:00:37.162 --> 02:00:38.718
In for a penny...

02:01:22.844 --> 02:01:24.414
Shit!

02:02:51.609 --> 02:02:55.626
... He's cheating on you, I have proof I know
you don't need to see. Untether yourself - Dad.

02:02:57.075 --> 02:02:59.334
Linda?

02:02:59.661 --> 02:03:02.602
We gotta get the attorneys
on the phone. Right now!

02:03:10.201 --> 02:03:14.817
Can I ask? When did you know I had
something to do with Harlan's death?

02:03:15.794 --> 02:03:19.559
From the first moment you
set foot in front of me.

02:03:23.654 --> 02:03:24.795
Oh shit!

02:03:24.795 --> 02:03:28.762
I want you to remember
something that's very important:

02:03:29.368 --> 02:03:35.425
you won not by playing the game
Harlan's way, but yours.

02:03:37.629 --> 02:03:40.023
You're a good person.

02:03:41.308 --> 02:03:42.974
This family.

02:03:48.882 --> 02:03:51.287
I should help them, right?

02:03:52.541 --> 02:03:54.871
I have my own opinion.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.197
But I have a feeling
you'll follow your heart.
