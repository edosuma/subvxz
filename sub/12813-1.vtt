Come on! We have cake!

16:46.672 --> 16:49.674
[all screaming]

16:49.758 --> 16:53.052
- [laughing]
- [girl] Eww!

16:58.183 --> 16:59.183
[mouthing] Sorry.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.314
Lilly, please pick up.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.531
- [Robby Ray] Did you see this?
- Yeah, I know. It's everywhere.

17:13.615 --> 17:16.159
Isn't it... horrible. Bad Hannah.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.327
She and I need to have
a little conversation.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.705
Now? But she's getting ready
to go to New York.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.375
Didn't she tell you?
There's an amazing opportunity.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.878
Yeah, I know about New York. I got
CCed in an e-mail. Not happening.

17:27.963 --> 17:31.090
She and I are flying to Tennessee
for her Grandma Ruby's birthday.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.217
Didn't she tell you?

17:33.302 --> 17:37.388
A shoe fight! You got
into a stinking shoe fight?

17:37.473 --> 17:39.724
In my defense,
I totally saw those shoes first.

17:39.808 --> 17:44.979
This is absolutely, T-totally,
without a doubt unacceptable.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.899
Which pretty much describes
all of your behavior lately.

17:47.983 --> 17:51.277
Standing up your brother?
Humiliating Lilly at her own party?

17:51.361 --> 17:54.405
I know. I screwed up. I'm sorry,
but I can't talk about this now.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.407
I got to go to New York.
It's the music awards.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.701
Your grandmother's birthday
doesn't matter?

17:58.786 --> 18:00.745
This is totally different
and you know it.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.081
Now, Robby. Mr. Ray.

18:03.165 --> 18:06.709
Father Montana, Hannah not going
to New York is really not an option.

18:06.794 --> 18:10.338
- Her name is Miley.
- Miley'll be back before she leaves.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.216
She's a superstar. I can get her
a private jet if she wants.

18:13.300 --> 18:15.843
Yes! I've always wanted
one of those.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.303
For gosh sakes.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.768
Fine. You win.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.187
But you heard our superstar.
She needs a jet.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.064
- Really?
- I like your thinking.

18:28.148 --> 18:29.732
It will take some time to arrange,

18:29.817 --> 18:32.527
but I'll go ahead to New York
and set up the meet and greet.

18:42.496 --> 18:47.041
Ooh. Next time, you might want to
demand a jet with a bigger bathroom.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.168
Why in the heck you
getting all Hannahed up?

18:49.253 --> 18:51.379
The Hannah steps off the plane photo op.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.966
The balloons, the limos,
the screaming fans.

18:55.050 --> 18:58.427
Like Vita says,
"It's all about the publicity."

18:58.512 --> 19:02.390
Yeah. That Vita's
just full of good advice.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.060
Absolutely full of it.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.440
Hello, New York!

19:12.276 --> 19:14.861
[cow mooing]

19:19.491 --> 19:20.867
Looks like your limo's here.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.208
Ain't she a beaut?

19:29.293 --> 19:31.878
Yee doggies. Tennessee.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.177
Dad, come on.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.929
Yeah, maybe I should've
remembered Grandma's birthday.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.682
- I did.
- Jackson, not now.

19:44.766 --> 19:48.311
Dad! Please, Hannah Montana
needs to be walking down the red carpet

19:48.395 --> 19:50.271
in New York in less than three hours.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.482
Miley, all you ever
wanted to do was sing.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.194
Hannah let you do that
and still have a normal life.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.029
That was the dream, remember?

19:59.448 --> 20:02.575
That's why we
created her in the first place.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.869
I don't know what she's about anymore.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.997
- What are you saying?
- I think we might be done.

20:10.792 --> 20:14.462
- You can't take Hannah away from me.
- Really? Because that's what I'm doing.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.632
No! Stop the truck. I'm not
doing this. I want to go home.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.425
Stop the truck!

20:38.195 --> 20:41.239
You are home. Look around you.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.865
Hannah means everything to me.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.992
That right there might be the problem.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.374
You're saying I can
never be Hannah again?

20:51.458 --> 20:54.043
Ask me again in two weeks.

20:54.127 --> 20:56.420
Right now let's see
if a country girl still exists.

20:56.505 --> 20:59.757
- Two weeks?
- Think of it as a Hannah detox.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.926
Take that wig off
and get back in the truck.

21:02.010 --> 21:06.764
No. I'm not getting
back in the truck. No way.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.275
I'm not getting back in the truck, Dad.

21:17.359 --> 21:21.028
I'm going to New York whether you
like it or not, and I'm not... Whoa!

21:22.322 --> 21:24.031
Give that back, you mangy little...

21:24.116 --> 21:27.952
Look at that. Girl don't even
recognize her own horse.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.787
Now that truly is sad.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.206
Blue Jeans?

21:37.671 --> 21:40.923
Meet us at the house.
Just about a mile up the road.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.392
Don't forget your suitcase.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.067
In my defense, you do look different.

22:02.070 --> 22:03.696
Did you do something to your tail?

22:31.016 --> 22:32.516
[grunts]

22:32.601 --> 22:35.811
Good boy.
All right, now. Help me out.

[boy] Ya!

23:34.413 --> 23:35.663
[horse snorting]

23:40.544 --> 23:42.670
Hi. You all right?

23:43.505 --> 23:45.923
Blue Jeans doesn't really
take well to strangers.

23:46.007 --> 23:49.260
Especially not dirty, sparkly ones.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.305
I know. He's my horse.

23:56.518 --> 23:57.726
Miley?

23:58.979 --> 24:01.313
It's me. Travis?

24:01.398 --> 24:05.359
Travis Brody? We were
in the first grade together.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.653
Me and you went to your
Uncle Earl's farm and swam

24:07.737 --> 24:10.781
- and got poison oak all over our...
- I remember you, OK?

24:11.825 --> 24:14.326
I also remember you hanging me
headfirst down a well.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.496
Yeah. I guess I had a
pretty big crush on you back then.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.623
But don't worry about it.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.336
I'm over it. [scoffs]

24:25.422 --> 24:26.630
Good to know.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.635
Don't come around
too often anymore, do you?

24:31.720 --> 24:33.429
[Miley] Often enough.

24:33.513 --> 24:36.390
Only a couple times since your
ma died that I've heard about.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.976
[clears throat]
So how long are you staying?

24:39.060 --> 24:40.311
- Two weeks.
- Ha!

24:40.395 --> 24:43.314
- Good luck with that.
- What's that supposed to mean?

24:43.398 --> 24:45.983
Considering what you're wearing

24:46.067 --> 24:48.611
and the fact that you couldn't
get back on your horse,

24:48.695 --> 24:50.613
I'm guessing you
went California on us.

24:50.697 --> 24:54.742
I have not. You don't know
anything about me or California.

24:55.577 --> 24:58.621
Let me guess, celebrities are
just regular folk like you and me.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.373
- Some are.
- Oh. Uh-huh.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.584
You, uh... you
actually know any?

25:04.419 --> 25:05.753
I know Hannah Montana.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.714
Hannah Montana? Really?

25:09.424 --> 25:11.842
Yeah. I...

25:11.927 --> 25:14.512
I practically saved her life
surfing the other day.

25:14.596 --> 25:19.099
She owes me big time. We're like...
We're like best friends.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.604
Huh. Best friends.

25:24.439 --> 25:26.524
[grunts]

They're all waiting for you inside.
I'll take Blue Jeans, put him away.

25:30.195 --> 25:33.697
- You don't have to do that.
- It's kind of my job.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.368
I've been working for
your grandma for the summer.

25:37.452 --> 25:38.911
Ooh.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.542
This is usually about the time
someone would say "thank you."

25:44.626 --> 25:47.545
- I was getting there.
- No need.

25:48.797 --> 25:52.007
See you round, Smiley Miley.

25:52.092 --> 25:55.469
Remember? That's what he used
to call you. Smiley Miley.

Sorry. Sorry, everybody. Hey.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.628
Happy birthday, Grandma.

27:10.712 --> 27:15.591
Well, I just blew out my candles,
and I already got my birthday wish.

27:15.675 --> 27:18.385
Come here, sweet thing. Ohhh.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.972
I have missed you
more than you can imagine.

27:22.057 --> 27:24.141
And thank you.

27:24.225 --> 27:28.812
Thank you so much for this.
I just love it.

a place of honor.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.782
How long have you been planning this?

27:39.866 --> 27:43.494
Must have taken you forever to find it.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.996
Apparently, I've thought
of nothing else for weeks.

27:46.081 --> 27:47.498

the least of your worries.

Hey, Uncle Chuck.
Listen, it's time for cake.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.006
I'll collect the supper plates,
you pass out the forks.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.008

to say hi to a few folks.

28:01.388 --> 28:04.181

- Yeah.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.566
Got any plates for me?

Do me a favor. Introduce
yourself to Lorelai over there.

28:17.779 --> 28:21.198
She's new and a little shy.

You ain't up to your
matchmaking again, are you?

28:23.743 --> 28:27.037
- Me? Never.
- That's right.

28:27.122 --> 28:30.165
Then I reckon it would be a shame
for anybody to feel left out.

28:30.250 --> 28:34.128
- Uh-huh.
- Excuse me. Got anything for me?

28:35.422 --> 28:37.715
I don't know.
Are you sure you can handle it?

28:37.799 --> 28:39.508
You'd be amazed at what I can handle.
