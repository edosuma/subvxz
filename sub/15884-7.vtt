Roommate meeting.

00:01.770 --> 00:03.344
Roommate meeting!

00:03.480 --> 00:05.195
Gogo, what the hell?
I've got a hangover!

00:06.149 --> 00:07.556
I don't give a [bleep]

00:07.591 --> 00:09.722
about your hangover,
okay, Brendan?

00:09.756 --> 00:13.778
I want a roommate meeting,
and I want it now!

00:13.812 --> 00:14.835
Okay.

00:14.870 --> 00:16.952
Now, somebody's
been taking [bleep]

00:16.986 --> 00:18.107
out of the refrigerator

00:18.141 --> 00:19.538
and throwing it
on the ground,

00:19.572 --> 00:21.330
and it's pissing me off.

00:21.365 --> 00:23.558
Is this another one
of your stupid pranks, Jonald?

00:23.593 --> 00:26.155
No.
And your pranks are stupid.

00:26.189 --> 00:28.651
- Is it you, Monday?
- What?

00:28.686 --> 00:30.018
(eerie music)
I said,

00:30.052 --> 00:31.782
somebody's been taking [bleep]
out of the fridge

00:31.816 --> 00:33.378
and throwing it
on the [bleep] ground.

00:33.412 --> 00:34.943
And I want to know
who it is,

00:34.977 --> 00:36.974
because it's not funny!

00:37.009 --> 00:38.138
Well, what I want to know is,

00:38.172 --> 00:39.804
who keeps pulling the sheets
off my bed

00:39.838 --> 00:41.735
and hanging them
from the ceiling fan at night?

00:41.769 --> 00:44.398
- Was that you, Monday?
- What?

00:44.432 --> 00:46.763
Have you been taking
everybody's sheets off them

00:46.798 --> 00:49.893
in the night and hanging them
from the ceiling fans?

00:49.927 --> 00:51.124
What? No.

00:51.158 --> 00:53.891
Well, clearly,
someone's been doing that!

00:53.926 --> 00:55.226
(glass shatters)
Whoa!

00:55.260 --> 00:56.560
Who did that?

00:56.594 --> 00:59.425
Yeah! who the [bleep]
just did that?

00:59.459 --> 01:01.591
Which one of you
just threw that bottle?

01:01.626 --> 01:03.724
What are we even talking
about right now?

01:03.759 --> 01:06.289
Did you [bleep]ing throw
that bottle, Jonald?

01:06.323 --> 01:07.856
No, Gogo!

01:07.890 --> 01:10.388
[bleep] you!
I didn't throw it!

01:10.423 --> 01:12.956
Well, did you [bleep]ing throw
that bottle, Brendon?

01:12.991 --> 01:15.691
Yeah!
You would do that, Brendon.

01:15.725 --> 01:18.692
Dude, no!
I didn't throw the bottle!

01:18.726 --> 01:21.793
Well, somebody threw
that [bleep]ing bottle,

01:21.827 --> 01:24.225
and you're the one who drew
dicks on everyone's forehead!

01:24.260 --> 01:26.259
Yeah, you did do that!

01:26.293 --> 01:28.125
But dicks are hilarious,
though!

01:28.160 --> 01:29.926
This is just destructive!

01:29.961 --> 01:31.460
What about you, Monday?

01:31.494 --> 01:33.026
Did you throw that bottle?

01:33.061 --> 01:34.761
(low growl)
What bottle?

01:34.795 --> 01:37.362
The [bleep]ing bottle, dude!

01:37.396 --> 01:39.096
It just smashed
against the wall,

01:39.130 --> 01:41.097
and you even said
some [bleep] about it!

01:41.132 --> 01:43.699
Well, I didn't throw
a bottle.

01:43.734 --> 01:46.701
Well, obviously,
it wasn't Ping.

Obama, baby?"

What's a lunge bump?

09:05.481 --> 09:07.015
Oh, that's, uh,
like if you, um,

09:07.049 --> 09:09.283
you get featured
if you lunge at somebody,

09:09.318 --> 09:11.085

a bump in your pay.

09:11.119 --> 09:12.353

09:12.387 --> 09:13.488

that y'all's doing--

09:20.763 --> 09:21.963
- Not now, Stan.
- Steve, it's Steve.

09:21.997 --> 09:23.131
- Okay.
- Okay.

at the fence.

Mack's gonna come by,

09:37.177 --> 09:38.910

into the fence, like,

Graaah!

Y-You want me to say
"Graaah"?
