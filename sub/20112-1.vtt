[woman] <i>Dr. Harber, 
before we're live,</i>

00:30.351 --> 00:32.729
<i>I just wanted to say thank you</i>
<i>for choosing me.</i>

00:32.812 --> 00:34.856
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

00:34.939 --> 00:37.275
[woman] <i>The rich history you have</i>
<i>with other journalists...</i>

00:37.900 --> 00:40.403
[Harber] <i>I chose you precisely</i>
<i>because we don't have a history.</i>

00:41.863 --> 00:43.406
Now, don't fuck it up.

00:45.533 --> 00:46.617
[woman 2] Fifteen seconds.

00:49.704 --> 00:54.459
People trust you...
for decades have valued you.

00:54.542 --> 00:56.919
I think that's because
people value the truth.

00:57.003 --> 01:01.507
Right, but don't you think
your discovery was just... too dangerous

01:01.591 --> 01:02.800
to share with the world?

01:02.884 --> 01:05.637
Look, this has been my life's work
for over 40 years.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.263
There's nothing willy-nilly here.

01:07.847 --> 01:11.142
After much discussion, much debate,
we all came to the same conclusion.

01:11.225 --> 01:13.102
-Which is?
-Which is, once you explore

01:13.186 --> 01:16.147
all scientific possibilities,
and you come to a consensus,

01:16.230 --> 01:20.318
how can you keep a discovery
so vital to our existence a secret?

01:20.860 --> 01:22.320
And that discovery...

01:23.446 --> 01:25.990
You proved the existence of an afterlife.

01:26.074 --> 01:29.494
I prefer to call it
a new plane of existence.

01:30.078 --> 01:33.998
I can't comment on terminology
like "soul" and "heaven" and "afterlife,"

01:34.082 --> 01:38.086
but what I can say with scientific
certainty is that once the body dies,

01:38.461 --> 01:43.174
some part of our consciousness
leaves us and travels to a new plane.

01:44.133 --> 01:49.013
Your machine was able
to capture brain wavelengths

01:49.097 --> 01:52.850
on a subatomic level,
leaving the body after death.

01:53.685 --> 01:55.436
-Is that...?
-That's correct.

01:57.397 --> 01:59.732
Where do those wavelengths go?

02:01.526 --> 02:05.154
My point is,
a new plane of existence is out there.

02:05.238 --> 02:07.573
Yes, that is no longer in dispute.

02:07.657 --> 02:10.535
But you can't tell us
what that is exactly.

02:10.618 --> 02:13.079
When you see a train leave the station...

02:14.163 --> 02:17.542
do you need to know where it's going
to understand that you saw it leave?

02:17.625 --> 02:19.877
It's a tough pill to swallow.

02:19.961 --> 02:22.130
At one point,
so was the Earth being round.

02:23.506 --> 02:29.011
But, Dr. Harber, why did it take you
six months to address us?

02:29.512 --> 02:30.930
Where have you been?

02:31.931 --> 02:35.810
It seems to me
that I invited you here, to my home.

02:35.893 --> 02:37.812
Yes, you did. Thank you.

02:38.271 --> 02:41.441
But... we only received that invitation

02:41.524 --> 02:45.027
after the suicide toll
had rapidly reached a million.

02:45.111 --> 02:48.698
And during that time,
celebrities, athletes,

02:48.781 --> 02:52.785
even a close colleague of yours,
all ended their lives.

02:52.869 --> 02:56.581
Which is why I agreed to sit with you
and try to calm the waters.

02:57.748 --> 02:58.875
Okay.

03:00.084 --> 03:01.544
I wanna ask you the question

03:01.627 --> 03:04.922
that everybody watching right now
is probably wondering.

03:05.631 --> 03:10.011
Do you feel responsible
for all those people killing themselves?

03:10.761 --> 03:11.596
No.

03:13.055 --> 03:14.932
-That's it?
-That's it.

03:16.893 --> 03:20.313
[man] Thank you, Dr. Harber...
for my fresh start.

03:20.396 --> 03:21.772
[woman 1] Andy, no!

03:22.356 --> 03:23.608
Andy!

03:23.691 --> 03:24.942
-Andy!
-[woman 2] Oh, no.

03:25.359 --> 03:26.611
[woman 1] Oh, God!

03:26.694 --> 03:28.821
-Why would you do that?
-[woman 2] Somebody call 911.

03:28.988 --> 03:30.156
[woman 1] Help! Some....

03:30.406 --> 03:31.574
Call help, please.

03:31.657 --> 03:33.868
Right now. Get someone here.

03:33.951 --> 03:35.036
My God!

03:35.119 --> 03:36.496
Why would you do that?

03:36.871 --> 03:38.122
Oh, God.

03:38.873 --> 03:40.500
Turn those cameras off.

04:16.035 --> 04:19.872
[man] <i>Welcome back to our coverage of</i>
<i>the two-year anniversary of the Discovery.</i>

04:19.956 --> 04:23.417
<i>We'll be revisiting the touchstone moments</i>
<i>of the past two years,</i>

04:23.501 --> 04:26.003
<i>with retrospectives all weekend long.</i>

04:26.087 --> 04:28.422
<i>Hard to believe that</i>
<i>it's been a year and a half</i>

04:28.506 --> 04:31.801
<i>since Thomas Harber's first</i>
<i>and only post-Discovery interview</i>

04:31.884 --> 04:35.096
<i>ended suddenly with an on-air suicide.</i>

04:35.179 --> 04:40.351
<i>Since then, the worldwide suicide toll</i>
<i>has skyrocketed to staggering levels.</i>

04:40.434 --> 04:43.604
<i>Over four million people</i>
<i>have taken their lives,</i>

04:43.688 --> 04:45.690
<i>attempting to "get there."</i>

04:46.107 --> 04:49.652
<i>As for Dr. Thomas Harber,</i>
<i>he has not made a public appearance</i>

04:49.735 --> 04:52.280
<i>since that infamous</i>
<i>post-Discovery interview.</i>

04:52.363 --> 04:54.073
<i>Completely off the grid--</i>

05:09.714 --> 05:11.340
[woman] <i>I was listening to that.</i>

05:11.424 --> 05:12.675
I was listening to that.

05:14.051 --> 05:17.096
I'm sorry, I thought--
I thought that I was alone.

05:17.847 --> 05:20.892
It's off-season. Why the fuck
are you going to this dreary island?

05:22.018 --> 05:23.394
Well, you're going there.

05:25.021 --> 05:26.022
[moans]

05:44.540 --> 05:45.458
Hi.

05:46.125 --> 05:46.959
Hi.

05:50.838 --> 05:52.381
Are you one of those lunatics

05:52.465 --> 05:55.926
who just sits next to a complete stranger
in an empty movie theater?

05:56.010 --> 05:57.678
You look so familiar to me.

05:57.762 --> 05:59.263
It's possible we've met,

05:59.347 --> 06:01.515
but you don't have
a memorable face.

06:02.642 --> 06:04.101
Okay. [chuckles]

06:04.185 --> 06:08.147
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that.
I didn't mean that. I just...

06:09.190 --> 06:11.067
The water. I'm just a little seasick.

06:13.611 --> 06:16.989
That's weird. It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.

06:17.073 --> 06:17.990
Um...

06:19.742 --> 06:21.243
-Vertigo.
-I'm not dizzy.

06:21.577 --> 06:24.705
You can't treat vertigo, just the effects.
That's for nausea.

06:27.875 --> 06:32.546
Do I look like the kind of girl who's just
gonna take a pill from some strange guy?

06:33.130 --> 06:33.964
Fair enough.

06:43.265 --> 06:45.142
Isla. My name's Isla.

06:46.143 --> 06:48.104
I don't look like an Isla, though.

06:48.187 --> 06:49.563
Your first three years,

06:49.647 --> 06:51.565
you look like whatever name you're given,

06:51.649 --> 06:54.402
then by four, you either settle
into your name or you just...

06:55.653 --> 06:58.030
-What about you?
-What?

06:58.114 --> 06:59.240
What's your name?

06:59.907 --> 07:02.410
Oh, uh, Will Stevenson.

07:04.245 --> 07:05.204
[mouths] Will.

07:06.414 --> 07:07.331
What?

07:07.415 --> 07:09.709
I'm just trying to see
if you look like your name.

07:10.292 --> 07:13.129
-What's the verdict there?
-I don't know.

07:14.588 --> 07:15.798
It's too early to tell.

07:16.674 --> 07:20.219
You know,
Will is just such a, like, "Will" name.

07:20.302 --> 07:21.512
[chuckles]

07:21.595 --> 07:22.722
You're really something.

07:23.889 --> 07:26.559
Happy second Discovery anniversary, Will.

07:27.018 --> 07:30.521
They said on the news they're expecting
like a whole slew of suicides today.

07:30.604 --> 07:32.773
People trying to get there
for the anniversary.

07:32.940 --> 07:34.608
I heard something about that.

07:34.692 --> 07:36.944
Did you see that video
of those dumb cheerleaders

07:37.028 --> 07:38.696
taking pills on the 50-yard line?

07:38.779 --> 07:41.449
I just can't get behind the concept
of suicide groups.

07:41.532 --> 07:47.079
It's so... disingenuous, you know?
It just feels so weak.

07:47.663 --> 07:51.208
-You don't believe in the Discovery?
-No, I don't believe in suicide groups.

07:51.292 --> 07:54.378
The Discovery is--
I mean, the proof is overwhelming.

07:54.462 --> 07:57.548
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
Proof should be definitive.

07:58.299 --> 07:59.508
So, you don't believe.

08:02.511 --> 08:05.139
I don't believe the way
everybody else does. No, I don't.

08:05.222 --> 08:08.017
-And how's that?
-I'm a neurologist.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.936
Three months ago,
I had a patient, really young,

08:11.020 --> 08:13.981
found out that she had brain cancer.
Very sad.

08:14.565 --> 08:16.108
She reacted to that diagnosis

08:16.192 --> 08:18.861
as though I'd handed her
a fucking winning lottery ticket.

08:19.445 --> 08:22.656
It wasn't because she hoped that
maybe she was going someplace better.

08:22.740 --> 08:26.619
It was because the Discovery
made her think that it was guaranteed.

08:26.702 --> 08:29.747
Well, yeah. Death used to be something
we just had to live with,

08:29.830 --> 08:33.208
and now it's a convenient way
to escape pain. That's okay.

08:33.292 --> 08:36.253
That's okay?
Another plane of existence, maybe.

08:36.337 --> 08:39.965
Who knows? But I look around, I see
a lot of people jumping out of planes

08:40.049 --> 08:41.759
hoping they're gonna grow wings.

08:42.176 --> 08:44.720
Reality and fantasy
are mutually exclusive.

08:44.804 --> 08:47.098
They don't exist in the same space.

08:48.891 --> 08:50.893
[car engine revving]

09:09.453 --> 09:10.287
What?

09:12.331 --> 09:15.459
When I was five, I had an accident,
and I died for about a minute.

09:17.837 --> 09:20.840
When I was resuscitated,
I told my parents that I saw something.

09:21.382 --> 09:23.425
Flashes. A little boy.

09:24.093 --> 09:26.512
Me, maybe, or my brother.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.098
I felt stranded...

09:29.849 --> 09:30.683
Stranded where?

09:31.851 --> 09:34.854
This empty beach.
It doesn't matter. It was a dream.

09:36.105 --> 09:38.399
It was a dream that I embellished
after I woke up.

09:38.482 --> 09:40.401
[vehicle approaching]

09:45.197 --> 09:46.657
Why would you make all that up?

09:47.449 --> 09:49.410
I think it's our instinct
to search for meaning,

09:49.493 --> 09:52.413
and when there is none,
it's our instinct to create meaning

09:52.496 --> 09:56.292
and we just... lie. We lie to ourselves.

09:57.710 --> 10:00.838
You are so annoying.
Has anyone ever told you that?

10:02.631 --> 10:04.258
Yeah, they have.

10:04.842 --> 10:07.136
Ugh. Thank God we only have
a minute left together

10:07.219 --> 10:08.596
before we're strangers again.

10:09.513 --> 10:12.641
You think it's gonna be a minute
this time of year? You're crazy.

10:12.850 --> 10:14.852
[vehicle approaching]

10:18.105 --> 10:18.981
Crazy, but right.

10:19.064 --> 10:22.359
That's the attractive-girl component
and I didn't factor that in.

10:22.443 --> 10:24.069
[Isla] You'd better work on your math.

10:26.822 --> 10:27.698
Hey!

10:28.616 --> 10:31.952
For whatever it's worth,
I think you do look like an Isla.

10:32.494 --> 10:34.413
How many of us have you met?

10:37.166 --> 10:38.459
[Isla chuckles]

10:40.377 --> 10:41.378
[door closes]

10:46.091 --> 10:49.053
[horn honking]

11:10.824 --> 11:12.826
[country music playing over stereo]

11:15.788 --> 11:17.790
-I got it.
-No, I got it, man.

11:17.873 --> 11:20.459
Well, I don't want to die
before we get there, Toby.

11:31.553 --> 11:33.973
-What's going on over here?
-Eddie.

11:34.807 --> 11:38.519
-Wait, Eddie Iodice? Eddie died?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, just to get there.

11:40.187 --> 11:41.855
Just to fucking get there.

11:43.232 --> 11:44.525
Guy pulled a Marilyn Monroe,

11:44.608 --> 11:47.361
downed a whole bottle of pills right there
in his bedroom.

11:48.070 --> 11:49.071
[chuckles]

11:50.572 --> 11:51.573
Good dude, too.

11:52.449 --> 11:54.660
-Real pity.
-You didn't wanna go to the service?

11:57.079 --> 12:00.708
Go to the...? I would rather stick
my dick in a wood chipper

12:01.125 --> 12:03.335
-than go to another fucking funeral.
-Got it.

12:09.550 --> 12:13.012
You know, I'm not as stupid
as you might think.

12:14.263 --> 12:16.807
When you called the other day
and I told you

12:17.182 --> 12:18.809
that Dad had built something new...

12:20.060 --> 12:21.270
after that conversation...

12:22.896 --> 12:24.523
suddenly you wanted to come home.

12:27.484 --> 12:31.238
-You're sounding just as paranoid as him.
-[chuckles]

12:39.246 --> 12:41.248
[Toby] <i>Dad said he needed</i>
<i>to change things up.</i>

12:41.665 --> 12:44.001
<i>People knowing our address</i>
<i>was too dangerous.</i>

12:44.793 --> 12:48.047
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't tell you</i>
<i>on the phone,</i>

12:48.130 --> 12:50.799
<i>but we don't trust phones now.</i>

13:03.729 --> 13:04.646
Here we are.

13:15.491 --> 13:17.576
Off to see the wizard.

13:28.003 --> 13:29.421
[Will] What the fuck is this place?

13:32.508 --> 13:37.054
Uh, it used to be a summer camp
for "troubled youths."

13:38.055 --> 13:41.100
Which I never really understood,
because if they're bad kids,

13:41.183 --> 13:44.603
why would they deserve a fun summer?
You know?

13:45.979 --> 13:48.398
But then it shut down
and Dad bought it.

13:50.734 --> 13:51.819
What do you think?

13:52.569 --> 13:54.404
[Will] I think it's completely insane.

13:56.115 --> 14:01.203
Well, the truth is we just needed
a lot more space to house things.

14:02.538 --> 14:03.705
House what things?

14:05.624 --> 14:08.961
[Toby] These people were all affected
by the Discovery.

14:10.003 --> 14:13.882
Some of them arrived here after two
or three failed suicide attempts.

14:14.508 --> 14:15.884
We gave them a home,

14:15.968 --> 14:19.930
something to live for in this life,
a reason to contribute.

14:33.694 --> 14:35.446
Oh, uh, real quick.

14:35.988 --> 14:40.492
Just FYI, FBI-type thing,
protocol is no cell phones.

14:41.952 --> 14:45.164
-Yeah, okay. Let's go.
-Yeah.

14:51.253 --> 14:52.087
Hey, don't worry.

14:54.631 --> 14:56.383
[beeping]

14:58.051 --> 15:00.053
[equipment beeping]

15:00.762 --> 15:02.181
[man] This is truly thrilling.

15:02.347 --> 15:04.641
I can only compare it
to the model train set

15:04.725 --> 15:07.394
you let me assemble by myself
on my birthday.

15:10.105 --> 15:11.482
[woman] Cutting it a little close.

15:12.024 --> 15:16.361
[Toby] Oh, well, you know me.
Pins and needles, needles and pins.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.781
These goddamn machines.

15:20.949 --> 15:25.120
-Who the hell's that?
-His other son just returned.

15:25.829 --> 15:28.207
Surprisingly taller than I remember.

15:28.999 --> 15:30.417
Good to see you again, Cooper.

15:31.460 --> 15:32.836
Will, Lacey. Lacey...

15:34.296 --> 15:35.130
That went well.

15:36.507 --> 15:37.549
Where's Dad?

15:50.646 --> 15:53.023
-Is he dead?
-No, of course not.

15:54.358 --> 15:55.692
He is now.

15:55.776 --> 15:57.486
-[Lacey] Fifteen seconds.
-Dad?

15:57.569 --> 15:59.196
[alarm beeping]

15:59.279 --> 16:01.573
Take it easy.
They're just running some tests.

16:01.657 --> 16:03.492
-It's all routine.
-Ten seconds.

16:03.867 --> 16:06.453
Paddles charged... and ready.

16:06.995 --> 16:08.288
[defibrillator shocks]

16:09.331 --> 16:12.918
See, they're recharging the body
to reboot the brain.

16:13.377 --> 16:17.214
The longest he's ever officially under is,
like, 60 seconds.

16:30.602 --> 16:31.812
[exhales]

16:31.895 --> 16:34.481
-[high-pitched tone]
-[muffled chatter]

16:34.565 --> 16:38.485
[door opens and closes]

16:45.158 --> 16:49.079
So, Dad is now killing himself
and electroshocking back to life.

16:49.955 --> 16:50.789
No.

16:52.916 --> 16:53.792
Kind of.

16:54.501 --> 16:57.254
But you're...
You're looking at this all wrong.

16:57.921 --> 17:01.633
You're wearing whatever the opposite of...
What is it? Rose-colored glasses.

17:01.717 --> 17:03.051
That's what you're wearing.

17:03.135 --> 17:04.469
Shit-colored glasses.

17:05.929 --> 17:07.513
Anyway, you shouldn't worry,

17:07.598 --> 17:11.393
because all of this is being
closely monitored and controlled.

17:12.102 --> 17:16.440
And we both know you've always been
slightly skeptical of everything.

17:16.522 --> 17:18.066
Dad started a cult.

17:18.983 --> 17:21.028
-No.
-Can you not see that? This is a cult.

17:21.111 --> 17:24.196
All the way down to these followers
in different-colored jumpsuits.

17:24.281 --> 17:28.035
No, no, no.
There's no hierarchy here, Will.

17:28.117 --> 17:32.039
Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.

17:32.122 --> 17:35.626
-That's all. It's not a cult.
-It should be different. Straitjackets.

17:36.126 --> 17:38.754
You're the one
that wanted to come back here

17:38.837 --> 17:41.381
for whatever reason. Right?

17:41.465 --> 17:45.636
Now, that, right there,
is the million-dollar question.

17:46.386 --> 17:47.346
Welcome back, Will.

17:53.727 --> 17:54.811
[clears throat]

17:57.356 --> 17:59.733
-[Will groans]
-[Harber sighs]

17:59.816 --> 18:01.193
You mind telling me something?

18:02.527 --> 18:03.862
What are you doing back here?

18:06.323 --> 18:08.450
I'm here because I want you to stop it.

18:09.284 --> 18:12.120
I'm asking you
just to put an end to all this.

18:12.371 --> 18:13.664
How would I do that?

18:15.207 --> 18:16.625
Say that you were wrong.

18:17.834 --> 18:18.835
Take it all back.

18:18.919 --> 18:21.630
I can't take it back, Will,
because it's the truth.

18:21.713 --> 18:22.923
Who knows better than you?

18:23.006 --> 18:25.509
You were the inspiration for this.
Aren't you curious?

18:26.259 --> 18:27.969
Please, don't say that. That's not...

18:28.887 --> 18:31.848
-I wasn't.
-Ah, but you were. Hang on.

18:38.647 --> 18:40.899
"Therefore, it is my belief

18:40.982 --> 18:44.361
consciousness should be considered
as another state of matter."

18:44.444 --> 18:45.487
-Please don't.
-Hang on.

18:45.570 --> 18:47.864
I'd like to get to this other part.
It gets good.

18:48.907 --> 18:52.202
"Properties of consciousness arise
from the physical laws

18:52.411 --> 18:53.662
that govern our universe."

18:53.745 --> 18:54.788
[sighs]

18:54.871 --> 18:57.040
-I was wrong.
-You don't believe that.

18:59.376 --> 19:01.002
We were wrong, Dad.

19:01.753 --> 19:03.922
We were wrong
because a lot of people died.

19:05.173 --> 19:08.969
And a whole lot more people
are gonna kill themselves...

19:09.678 --> 19:13.265
while you experiment here
in this ridiculous fortress.

19:13.348 --> 19:16.309
So, just slamming on the brakes
of 40 years' work?

19:17.853 --> 19:19.271
I'd be saying I'm responsible.

19:19.855 --> 19:20.689
Maybe you are.

19:21.440 --> 19:22.733
So, you think I've gone too far?

19:24.568 --> 19:26.486
Well, I don't think I've gone far enough.

19:27.904 --> 19:30.073
We opened the door for these people, Will.

19:30.824 --> 19:31.950
They know it's there.

19:32.993 --> 19:34.953
Now we have to show them what's behind it.

19:40.167 --> 19:41.001
[door closes]

20:11.656 --> 20:13.575
-[high-pitched tone]
-[muffled chatter]

20:35.764 --> 20:36.598
Isla!

20:57.702 --> 20:58.703
Isla!

21:16.388 --> 21:17.305
Isla!

21:21.059 --> 21:22.060
[muffled shout]

21:29.526 --> 21:30.527
Isla!

21:36.825 --> 21:37.826
[Will yells]

21:38.952 --> 21:40.453
[Will] Oh, fuck!

21:41.496 --> 21:44.499
-What are you doing?
-What's your problem?

21:46.585 --> 21:47.836
[groans]

21:49.588 --> 21:52.507
Come on. Stand up. Get up.

21:55.886 --> 21:58.722
-[Will] <i>Why are you doing this?</i>
-[Isla] <i>None of your fucking business.</i>

21:58.805 --> 22:03.226
You sat there on that fucking ferry
and had a conversation with me,

22:03.310 --> 22:04.853
knowing you were gonna do this.

22:04.936 --> 22:08.690
You were supposed to be
the last person I ever spoke to.

22:11.693 --> 22:13.737
You don't get to just change that!

22:15.780 --> 22:18.742
Ah. You're not even emotional about dying.

22:19.409 --> 22:22.495
I'm not emotional about anything.

22:38.136 --> 22:40.388
[Toby] <i>I'm just concerned...</i>

22:40.680 --> 22:44.643
<i>that this will all be perceived</i>
<i>unfavorably by some.</i>

22:44.726 --> 22:47.062
[Will] <i>She was going</i>
<i>to catch pneumonia, Toby.</i>

22:47.437 --> 22:50.273
[Toby] <i>I still don't know</i>
<i>what you want me to do with her.</i>

22:50.357 --> 22:54.569
[Will] <i>You told me that you take in people</i>
<i>who need help. She needs help.</i>

22:54.653 --> 22:57.947
She still can't just stay here.
We have rules.

22:58.031 --> 23:02.035
Then can we make an exception...
in her case, please?

23:02.410 --> 23:04.162
We're talking about somebody's life.

23:04.245 --> 23:08.041
We have no idea
if she will attempt or try to...

23:09.542 --> 23:10.752
Kill myself again?

23:12.087 --> 23:15.215
You can say it. I know what happened.
I was there when you ruined it.

23:15.298 --> 23:17.133
She and I have been getting along great.

23:18.218 --> 23:19.761
We still have rules.

23:19.844 --> 23:22.430
She has to talk to Dad,
and she has to take the questionnaire.

23:22.514 --> 23:23.682
What's the questionnaire?

23:24.349 --> 23:26.351
-Um...
-Can we be...?

23:29.979 --> 23:31.147
Will, you have a visitor.

23:32.732 --> 23:34.984
Your dad is Thomas Harber?

23:39.239 --> 23:41.574
[Harber] So, nobody but the conductor,

23:41.658 --> 23:44.077
which is me,
is gonna know your answers.

23:44.828 --> 23:47.038
Everything is completely discreet here.

23:48.707 --> 23:51.126
And now Lacey will be giving us
some privacy.

23:53.837 --> 23:57.132
It used to be about global exploration,
you know, discovering new land,

23:57.215 --> 23:58.550
and then it was space travel.

23:58.967 --> 24:01.553
Shining a light on the dark corners
of the universe.

24:02.095 --> 24:04.764
And now it's exploring
what comes after this life.

24:06.433 --> 24:08.643
Seeing what's next. How old are you?

24:10.311 --> 24:12.689
[man on recording]
<i>You are all part of the same thing.</i>

24:13.148 --> 24:14.232
<i>Cells in a body.</i>

24:14.649 --> 24:16.234
<i>Waves in the ocean.</i>

24:17.485 --> 24:19.904
<i>The soul isn't young or old.</i>

24:22.824 --> 24:26.786
[Harber] Do you accept the fact that time
is a nonlinear illusion created by man?

24:27.746 --> 24:29.748
Pass. I don't know what that means.

24:29.831 --> 24:32.500
There are no right or wrong answers
to this questionnaire.

24:32.584 --> 24:36.004
-Then why do you bother giving it?
-That's a good response.

24:37.464 --> 24:41.259
[Harber] <i>Okay, greatest ability...</i>
<i>and most disappointing weakness.</i>

24:42.427 --> 24:45.221
[Isla] <i>I guess I'm good at seeing</i>
<i>what makes somebody tick.</i>

24:45.847 --> 24:47.432
<i>Understanding who they really are.</i>

24:48.433 --> 24:49.517
[Harber] Weakness?

24:49.601 --> 24:52.562
I'm able to understand them,
but I'm not able to care about them.

24:53.104 --> 24:55.774
If somebody mentions "subconscious"
to you, what do you think?

24:56.357 --> 24:58.234
-Memory.
-Dig deeper.

24:59.277 --> 25:02.781
-Hidden memory.
-Would you say that you suppress emotions?

25:03.364 --> 25:05.700
I don't really like talking
about myself like this.

25:05.784 --> 25:08.870
You don't have to like it.
We think about ourselves every day.

25:08.953 --> 25:12.832
Everything is from our own perspective.
So, as much as you may not want

25:12.916 --> 25:15.084
to indulge yourself in looking
at your most inner thoughts,

25:15.168 --> 25:17.629
they're there.
Make no mistake. They are there.

25:23.092 --> 25:26.554
[Harber] <i>Do you believe in a soul?</i>
<i>If not, close your eyes.</i>

25:29.891 --> 25:33.561
<i>Great. Let's just say a soul does exist.</i>
<i>Where in the body do you think it'd be?</i>

25:34.479 --> 25:37.690
I think if there's a soul,
it would belong in the brain.

25:38.149 --> 25:39.818
[machine beeps]

25:40.527 --> 25:41.528
[Harber] Wow.

25:42.237 --> 25:44.656
Now, that's interesting.
Most people say the stomach.

25:44.739 --> 25:46.157
But I like that you didn't.

25:55.166 --> 25:57.210
[Harber]
<i>Have you ever experienced sudden loss?</i>

25:58.586 --> 25:59.462
Yes.

26:00.213 --> 26:04.509
And what aspect of regaining normalcy
after losing someone...

26:06.427 --> 26:07.762
was the most difficult?

26:11.099 --> 26:14.435
Inanimate objects, maybe? Like...

26:16.145 --> 26:18.481
<i>my coffee table. I've had it for years</i>

26:18.565 --> 26:22.527
and I've probably looked at it
a million times, but after he--

26:24.779 --> 26:27.615
Familiar objects just became
distorted and unfamiliar.

26:27.699 --> 26:31.995
I started to hate my ceiling fan,
my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.

26:34.873 --> 26:36.082
[Harber] <i>Okay, last question.</i>

26:37.166 --> 26:39.335
Are you legitimately suicidal?

26:45.008 --> 26:48.303
If you knew what came after...
this life...

26:49.304 --> 26:51.347
do you think it would affect
your decision-making

26:51.431 --> 26:53.558
or maybe even make you change
your mind?

26:54.726 --> 26:57.228
Maybe. Knowing could change things.

27:05.695 --> 27:07.864
How'd you know
this is where you'd be staying?

27:10.325 --> 27:11.534
I found our old bed.

27:11.743 --> 27:12.952
Yeah, I see that.

27:13.036 --> 27:15.997
And you should thank me...
by the way, because

27:16.080 --> 27:17.123
[grunts]

27:17.206 --> 27:19.834
I fought long and hard
to keep old faithful here.

27:22.378 --> 27:23.296
How's Isla?

27:25.131 --> 27:29.469
Oh... That's actually why I'm here.
Will, she's dead.

27:30.637 --> 27:34.349
No, she's not. She's not dead.
That was a bad joke.

27:34.432 --> 27:37.727
Um... But the questionnaire is
all wrapped up.

27:39.062 --> 27:40.063
She can stay.

27:41.272 --> 27:44.108
Yeah, good. She needs to be looked after.
She could try again.

27:46.110 --> 27:49.113
I don't think
that's going to happen, Will.

27:55.703 --> 27:56.955
[sighs]

27:58.414 --> 27:59.916
Because tonight...

28:01.834 --> 28:03.086
everything changes.

28:04.337 --> 28:07.256
We finally unveil it.

28:07.966 --> 28:09.384
What is "it," Toby?

28:12.011 --> 28:15.390
Dad wanted me to invite you
to a little gathering tonight,

28:15.473 --> 28:17.517
just a select group.

28:20.353 --> 28:22.397
Boy, this is nothing
like our old house, huh?

28:33.282 --> 28:36.411
It sounds to me
a lot like you're advocating murder.

28:37.078 --> 28:40.456
I'm not advocating murder.
I'm just pointing out that most people

28:40.540 --> 28:43.293
don't look at ending somebody else's life
the way they do their own.

28:45.503 --> 28:47.422
[sighing] Where is he?

28:48.673 --> 28:49.966
It's about to happen.

28:50.508 --> 28:53.678
I can't tell when you're talking to me
or that. It's really annoying.

28:55.763 --> 28:59.559
Anyways, what I'm saying is, people are
killing themselves to get there.

28:59.642 --> 29:02.812
At a certain point, they'll use
the same logic to kill somebody else,

29:03.062 --> 29:05.565
'cause they're just sending them
somewhere else, right?

29:06.733 --> 29:08.276
Finally, he's here.

29:09.902 --> 29:13.656
And he is not wearing
the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.

29:15.992 --> 29:18.995
We're programmed
to process our experiences

29:19.078 --> 29:24.417
as having a beginning and an end,
when, in reality... doesn't exist.

29:25.626 --> 29:28.004
It's just one long, drawn-out middle.

29:29.130 --> 29:30.840
Some of you are newer than others,

29:30.923 --> 29:35.136
but I wanted to create a select group
that could see what it is that I built.

29:36.012 --> 29:39.515
But before we do that,
I'd like to take a moment

29:39.640 --> 29:44.520
and have you join me
in... bowing our heads...

29:50.610 --> 29:55.198
And let your subconscious...
take you somewhere else.

30:00.495 --> 30:04.123
I'm sort of amazed that you get
swept up in this, this easily.

30:04.207 --> 30:07.627
You don't strike me
as a say-your-prayers type.

30:07.710 --> 30:11.339
Just because somebody doesn't believe
in God doesn't mean they can't pray.

30:11.422 --> 30:13.508
What kind of an atheist talks to God?

30:13.591 --> 30:16.010
[opera music playing over speakers]

30:19.430 --> 30:22.433
Why did you give me
a phony, bullshit last name?

30:24.227 --> 30:27.355
It wasn't phony.
It was my mother's maiden name.

30:27.939 --> 30:29.107
Where is she?

30:30.650 --> 30:31.526
She's dead.

30:33.778 --> 30:35.238
How did she die?

30:37.949 --> 30:39.075
Because of my dad.

30:42.203 --> 30:44.330
Let us come back into this moment.

30:52.964 --> 30:55.466
I now offer you the opportunity...

30:57.760 --> 30:59.387
to see the afterlife.

31:02.557 --> 31:04.434
I can now record where we go.

31:20.241 --> 31:23.661
[Cooper] Please, uh...
get these back to us

31:24.203 --> 31:25.913
at your earliest convenience.

31:26.747 --> 31:30.501
And again, these living quarters
are just temporary

31:30.585 --> 31:33.296
until we can find you
a more suitable room.

31:34.672 --> 31:38.551
When I first moved here,
I slept on a cot in the kitchen.

31:39.218 --> 31:41.262
-Glamorous.
-[chuckles]

31:41.554 --> 31:44.557
I'm supposed to be at the bottom
of the ocean, so this should be fine.

31:45.224 --> 31:46.058
Can I have a pen?

31:49.896 --> 31:51.105
Nondisclosure agreement.

31:51.189 --> 31:55.860
Well, considering the sensitivity,
it's a fairly standard document.

31:55.943 --> 31:58.070
Could we have the room for a second,
please?

32:01.866 --> 32:06.454
[Cooper] You remember that awful week
when we slept on the cot by the fridge?

32:06.537 --> 32:08.080
My back sure hasn't forgotten.

32:08.164 --> 32:09.999
-[Will] Hey.
-Mm.

32:11.167 --> 32:15.505
So... I know that
that device is very compelling. Um...

32:15.588 --> 32:18.549
-Can we talk about it for a second?
-I'm not allowed to talk about it,

32:18.633 --> 32:20.801
'cause I just signed
a nondisclosure agreement.

32:21.594 --> 32:22.929
[snickers]

32:23.012 --> 32:24.096
[sighs]

32:24.180 --> 32:27.767
So, your dad's a little weird.
Who cares? It doesn't make him wrong.

32:27.850 --> 32:31.896
I mean, Poe fucked his cousin.
It didn't make him any less a writer.

32:32.396 --> 32:34.649
I wanna see if that machine does
what he thinks it does.

32:35.191 --> 32:36.234
Well, what if it did?

32:37.652 --> 32:38.986
How would that change things?

32:39.946 --> 32:42.823
You don't go on vacation
without looking at the brochure first.

32:50.248 --> 32:53.209
Hey. Uh... I'm sorry. Were you sleeping?

32:54.585 --> 32:55.628
I'm standing.

32:56.587 --> 32:57.922
Well, yeah.

32:59.090 --> 33:01.592
That's just something
you're supposed to say, I guess.

33:02.552 --> 33:03.553
Um...

33:03.636 --> 33:07.348
Since you're up, mind coming downstairs
and taking a look at something for me?

33:07.848 --> 33:08.808
Yeah, sure.

33:11.018 --> 33:12.311
[sighs]

33:12.395 --> 33:16.315
[woman on recording] <i>Those that</i>
<i>we have lost are not lost at all...</i>

33:16.816 --> 33:19.569
-[Isla] Where are you guys going?
-It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

33:20.278 --> 33:22.363
<i>...then it's us who are lost.</i>

33:22.446 --> 33:28.411
When he flatlines, think of it
as a light bulb turned off by a switch.

33:28.494 --> 33:30.162
Flip it on, flip it off.

33:30.830 --> 33:34.208
But going under,
hooked up to the new device,

33:34.292 --> 33:36.544
you're not just flipping a light switch.

33:36.627 --> 33:40.381
You're essentially detaching
the entire bulb.

33:40.464 --> 33:42.883
So, I'd say that if you go under again...

33:43.426 --> 33:46.095
you're coming back
with next to no brain functionality.

33:46.178 --> 33:48.431
I'm sort of surprised
it hasn't happened already.

33:50.933 --> 33:54.437
I know you wanted to be first, but if you
don't come back, what's the point?

33:55.021 --> 33:57.898
We just go back
to the drawing board. Right?

33:58.816 --> 34:02.903
I mean, it could still work,
we just need to find a new way to...

34:02.987 --> 34:04.113
We need a cadaver.

34:06.115 --> 34:08.159
Okay. Uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.

34:09.034 --> 34:10.995
Where do you guys plan
on getting a corpse?

34:14.540 --> 34:15.708
I have a corpse idea.

34:30.806 --> 34:32.808
[rock music playing over earbuds]

34:34.143 --> 34:35.686
-Am I being rude?
-Huh?

34:35.770 --> 34:37.438
-Am I being rude?
-No.

34:39.482 --> 34:42.818
-Care to... listen?
-Sure.

34:44.527 --> 34:48.324
Crunchy groovy grooves.
Serene nights.

34:57.792 --> 34:59.460
-Can I ask you something?
-Mm-hmm.

35:00.044 --> 35:03.255
Will mentioned what happened
to your mom earlier.

35:03.839 --> 35:04.840
That she killed herself?

35:07.343 --> 35:08.511
Not exactly.

35:09.679 --> 35:11.180
So, she was trying to get there?

35:11.263 --> 35:15.226
No, that was a good couple years
before the Discovery.

35:17.728 --> 35:18.729
Huh.

35:26.904 --> 35:28.030
[bell rings]

35:30.825 --> 35:31.701
Yeah.

35:32.660 --> 35:34.704
[door buzzes]

35:41.460 --> 35:42.294
How you doing?

35:42.837 --> 35:47.007
In the midst of life, I am in death.

35:48.426 --> 35:52.471
That was weird. I was just wondering
if you could help me out.

35:52.555 --> 35:55.182
My, uh, cousin, Billy...

35:56.809 --> 35:58.102
he's gone missing.

35:58.185 --> 36:01.439
And it being the two-year anniversary
of the Discovery,

36:01.522 --> 36:04.191
we're all just a little worried.

36:05.359 --> 36:06.569
Really worried.

36:07.153 --> 36:10.239
We got three John Does in this week.
How long has he been missing?

36:11.532 --> 36:14.702
Nope. No. No Billy here.

36:15.745 --> 36:16.620
Bummer.

36:17.079 --> 36:19.248
Would have made my life
a hell of a lot easier.

36:20.374 --> 36:22.209
Sorry, that was insensitive.

36:22.793 --> 36:26.130
They just got me running rampant here.
I'm doing the job of five people.

36:27.465 --> 36:30.468
Off-season cutbacks and whatnot? Yeah.

36:32.344 --> 36:35.097
Can I give you a description... of Billy?

36:35.181 --> 36:39.977
That way if he does... come in,
you can keep an eye out for him.

36:40.644 --> 36:41.896
Of course.

36:42.813 --> 36:43.898
Let's go to my office.

36:51.155 --> 36:53.699
[Toby] Hey, so, just curious...

37:09.882 --> 37:10.716
[chuckles]

37:10.800 --> 37:14.470
I'd like to point out you're reading off
a laundry list of corpse requirements.

37:15.054 --> 37:16.555
Aneurysm, that won't work.

37:19.892 --> 37:23.729
It'd be nice if you could help me,
seeing as we're breaking and entering.

37:23.813 --> 37:27.149
Like a real, like, pouty-type face.

37:29.235 --> 37:30.611
And then, um...

37:32.238 --> 37:36.033
he's got a birthmark on, uh...

37:37.701 --> 37:42.081
Let's see. On his right elbow.
You're not writing any of this down.

37:42.164 --> 37:45.668
Well, I think I've got more
than I need to go on here, so...

37:45.751 --> 37:49.797
But we... We haven't even gotten
to the lower half of his body.

37:50.673 --> 37:53.843
Don't you think it's weird how
these people were alive a few hours ago?

37:53.926 --> 37:58.264
They had fears and desires,
they could exercise?

37:58.347 --> 38:01.809
I don't think it's weird.
I think it's fucking sad.

38:02.977 --> 38:05.980
-Maybe they went someplace better.
-Maybe they went someplace worse.

38:06.063 --> 38:08.816
Maybe they went someplace
that we can't even begin to comprehend.

38:09.275 --> 38:12.403
All the more reason to see
what your dad's machine shows us.

38:14.029 --> 38:14.864
Shit.

38:17.783 --> 38:18.617
What?

38:20.870 --> 38:22.663
"Fifty-two, massive coronary."

38:26.709 --> 38:27.543
Will...

38:30.754 --> 38:32.214
meet Pat Phillips.

38:36.010 --> 38:37.636
Pat Phillips, this is Will.

38:51.317 --> 38:53.527
I don't like that creepy room
Cooper put me in.

38:53.611 --> 38:55.404
I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight.

39:02.828 --> 39:03.913
Top or bottom?

39:14.840 --> 39:16.133
We could talk, you know.

39:19.929 --> 39:22.348
When I'm nervous,
I talk too much or not at all.

39:24.016 --> 39:25.935
Well, you're safe here.

39:26.018 --> 39:28.979
I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds.

39:34.026 --> 39:36.278
When I first got here
and they gave me that jumpsuit,

39:36.362 --> 39:39.323
it had a V etched on it.
I wonder what that stood for.

39:40.991 --> 39:41.992
"Visitor," maybe?

39:42.701 --> 39:43.535
Is that a guess?

39:44.495 --> 39:45.871
That was a pretty good guess.

39:46.872 --> 39:48.916
It's like one of those
really obvious answers

39:48.999 --> 39:52.086
that only seems obvious
after you find out about it.

39:52.795 --> 39:55.089
Were you really smart growing up?
I bet you were.

39:56.256 --> 40:00.219
I was told that I demonstrated an early
ability to recognize spatial patterns,

40:00.302 --> 40:01.512
whatever that means.

40:02.054 --> 40:05.140
I always took it as one of those things
a teacher tells to a parent

40:05.224 --> 40:07.601
to make them feel better
about their shitty kid.

40:08.352 --> 40:10.562
Like, "Gordon is very good
at drawing circles.

40:10.646 --> 40:14.274
Gordon draws circles at a more
advanced level than the other children."

40:16.068 --> 40:18.112
These bunk beds really worked out well,

40:18.195 --> 40:22.032
'cause they spared me the awkwardness of
having to tell you I'm not gonna fuck you.

40:23.367 --> 40:27.079
Sorry, all I heard was something
about circles and not fucking me.

40:29.039 --> 40:32.084
I don't wanna be the only fucked up person
on this bunk bed, Will.

40:32.167 --> 40:35.379
Maybe... tell me about your mom now.

40:41.218 --> 40:43.846
There's not much to tell.
She killed herself.

40:46.056 --> 40:47.307
On their anniversary.

40:51.729 --> 40:52.855
How did she do it?

40:56.859 --> 40:58.110
She made them dinner,

40:58.318 --> 41:02.239
and... my dad didn't
even come out of his office.

41:06.035 --> 41:10.497
If he'd even just hinted
that he gave a shit, I mean, who knows?

41:11.457 --> 41:13.876
But he couldn't be bothered.
So, she went upstairs...

41:15.044 --> 41:17.671
took a bath instead and, uh...

41:19.214 --> 41:21.717
Yeah, the next morning
I found her in the tub.

41:26.263 --> 41:27.389
And so, you left?

41:28.057 --> 41:30.851
Yeah, I had to.
I couldn't be around it. I knew.

41:33.395 --> 41:38.692
It's like everything that was recognizable
sort of instantly became unrecognizable.

41:44.740 --> 41:48.619
Sometimes I feel like I'm taking
someone else's spot and then I feel sad.

41:50.788 --> 41:51.622
How do you mean?

41:52.206 --> 41:54.708
Like, being here alive is a waste

41:54.792 --> 41:59.379
because... I don't enjoy it,
I'm not happy or grateful...

42:00.339 --> 42:02.341
and I'm taking a spot away
from someone who

42:02.424 --> 42:04.676
maybe would've gotten
something more out of it.

42:05.552 --> 42:06.553
Yeah.

42:07.471 --> 42:09.306
I guess I don't think it works that way.

42:14.853 --> 42:17.189
Here's something I haven't heard
anyone talk about.

42:17.815 --> 42:19.733
Do animals have an afterlife?

42:20.609 --> 42:25.197
Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys.
What happens to them after they die?

42:26.115 --> 42:29.201
I mean, I feel like they really deserve
an afterlife.

42:30.119 --> 42:32.496
Do they have their own animal afterlife?

42:32.788 --> 42:35.374
And if they do,
is it subdivided by species?

42:35.457 --> 42:38.168
Because it feels like something
as profound as an afterlife

42:38.252 --> 42:39.837
shouldn't practice segregation.

42:40.295 --> 42:41.296
[Will chuckles]

42:48.595 --> 42:50.305
And what happens to a child?

42:59.898 --> 43:01.859
Hold hands till we fall asleep?

43:16.874 --> 43:20.085
This doesn't seem entirely fair.

43:20.669 --> 43:21.879
Shh.

43:23.755 --> 43:24.798
Yeah, okay.

43:44.151 --> 43:45.777
[speaking indistinctly]

44:09.051 --> 44:10.010
Lacey?

44:18.352 --> 44:19.436
Okay, Toby?

44:22.314 --> 44:24.775
[machine beeps, then whirs]

44:28.862 --> 44:30.155
Did you hit...? Hit it again.

44:30.906 --> 44:33.325
[beeps, then whirs]

44:35.702 --> 44:36.578
Again.

44:37.120 --> 44:39.206
[beeping and whirring continue]

44:39.873 --> 44:40.791
Hit it again.

44:40.874 --> 44:41.959
I'm hitting it.

44:44.378 --> 44:45.295
Hit it again.

44:45.379 --> 44:48.090
-You're gonna fry the body.
-Toby, hit it again.

44:49.675 --> 44:51.009
Again.

44:52.427 --> 44:53.428
Hit it again.

44:56.848 --> 44:58.183
Again. Hit it again.

45:14.157 --> 45:15.158
[door closes]

45:21.081 --> 45:22.791
Is this just a setback or...?

45:24.042 --> 45:25.585
I'm really not sure.

45:29.172 --> 45:30.924
[keypad beeping]

45:31.008 --> 45:32.759
[door opens]

45:35.137 --> 45:36.388
[door closes]

47:21.743 --> 47:22.828
<i>Are you gonna see him?</i>

47:24.621 --> 47:27.207
<i>Or are you just gonna continue</i>
<i>to ignore it?</i>

47:27.833 --> 47:30.377
[Pat] <i>I'm sorry... I can't.</i>

47:30.460 --> 47:34.297
[woman] <i>Of course you can't.</i>
<i>Story of your fucking life.</i>

47:34.381 --> 47:37.217
<i>Just run away</i>
<i>and leave me to deal with the mess.</i>

47:43.265 --> 47:44.850
-Hey.
-Hey.

47:45.976 --> 47:47.769
What are you doing with my body?

47:48.353 --> 47:52.524
Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon,
so, I'm getting it ready.

47:53.066 --> 47:55.277
We do still have a little time
to prep a redo.

47:55.360 --> 47:59.030
Redo? Guys, come on.
You almost fried the body.

47:59.114 --> 48:02.033
You do this redo,
you're gonna cremate him early. All right?

48:04.578 --> 48:06.746
Toby, rustle up a van. Will's right.

48:16.464 --> 48:17.299
It's good.

48:19.050 --> 48:21.094
Seeing you back in the labs again,
it's good.

48:22.470 --> 48:23.513
It's where you belong.

48:30.187 --> 48:32.522
-[sighs]
-[door closes]

48:48.205 --> 48:50.457
[inaudible dialogue]

48:52.918 --> 48:56.129
Toby, I want you to locate me
a new corpse, immediately.

49:11.686 --> 49:13.939
Hey. Can I ask you something?

49:14.022 --> 49:16.149
-Okay.
-How'd you end up here?

49:17.234 --> 49:18.109
Why?

49:22.364 --> 49:25.533
I came home and found my dad
and my sister hanging in my living room.

49:26.826 --> 49:27.744
To get there.

49:29.913 --> 49:30.830
I'm sorry.

49:31.873 --> 49:34.793
It's okay. They didn't want me to come.

49:43.218 --> 49:44.844
Can you imagine feeling abandoned

49:44.928 --> 49:47.514
'cause your dad left you out
of the family suicide?

49:50.058 --> 49:51.059
What's wrong with you?

49:52.269 --> 49:53.270
Oh.

49:53.353 --> 49:55.230
Nothing, I'm just... I'm processing.

49:55.647 --> 49:56.898
[groans]

49:57.440 --> 50:00.777
I mean, do you ever get out of your head
even for one minute?

50:02.862 --> 50:04.030
Let's do an experiment.

50:04.489 --> 50:07.659
Look at me and tell me
the first thing that comes to your mind.

50:07.742 --> 50:08.868
I'm driving.

50:10.954 --> 50:11.830
Okay.

50:13.415 --> 50:15.292
I don't know you very well.

50:16.793 --> 50:20.505
I think you're beautiful, and alive,
and if you killed yourself,

50:20.588 --> 50:23.091
it wouldn't just be sad,
it would be a tragedy.

50:25.844 --> 50:26.845
Shut up.

50:35.937 --> 50:37.647
-You want the head or the feet?
-Head.

50:38.356 --> 50:39.524
Okay.

50:44.195 --> 50:46.990
"Oh, hey, Isla. What are you up to?"

50:48.116 --> 50:49.326
"Oh, nothing much, Jim.

50:50.327 --> 50:54.205
I'm just... lugging a corpse
through a parking lot."

50:55.123 --> 50:58.835
-Why'd you go with "Jim"?
-Don't be jealous of hypothetical Jim.

50:59.419 --> 51:02.672
Believe me, if hypothetical Jim
makes you not wanna kill yourself,

51:03.048 --> 51:04.299
I can be supportive.

51:04.424 --> 51:05.675
Do we just leave it here?

51:06.926 --> 51:11.139
Believe it or not, it's my first time
returning a corpse, so... I'm improvising.

51:15.185 --> 51:18.730
Hi, yeah, um, I was just driving by
and this is kind of weird,

51:18.813 --> 51:24.277
but there seems to be, like,
a dead body laying in your parking lot.

51:25.111 --> 51:26.946
-That was pretty good.
-Shut up. Get out.

51:27.030 --> 51:30.325
-I'm saying you're doing a good job. Fine.
-Stop it. Sorry. Yeah, no, bad...

51:30.408 --> 51:32.160
Bad reception on the island. Um...

51:32.243 --> 51:35.246
Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned,
and... I don't know.

51:35.330 --> 51:38.958
Unless, of course, you guys are playing
some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt.

51:42.128 --> 51:44.464
Okay. Yes, thank you. Bye.

51:54.432 --> 51:56.101
-How'd that go?
-It went really well.

51:56.184 --> 51:58.853
Okay. You're, like, weirdly good at that.

52:01.231 --> 52:02.273
-Oh.
-Here they are.

52:03.691 --> 52:05.693
-[Isla chuckles]
-They're pretty confused.

52:06.236 --> 52:07.862
What do you think they're thinking?

52:09.072 --> 52:13.535
I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips
has had a really tough few days.

52:14.828 --> 52:16.162
We're both going to hell.

52:17.080 --> 52:19.958
Yeah. Whatever the afterlife is, I guess.

52:22.502 --> 52:24.421
I don't know. Just stupid.

52:39.727 --> 52:40.895
[sighs]

52:42.439 --> 52:43.731
[engine starts]

53:11.676 --> 53:12.677
Are you gonna see him?

53:14.471 --> 53:16.931
Or are you just gonna continue
to ignore it?

53:17.599 --> 53:20.268
[Pat] <i>I'm sorry... I can't.</i>

53:20.351 --> 53:24.230
[woman] <i>Of course you can't.</i>
<i>Story of your fucking life.</i>

53:24.314 --> 53:27.108
<i>Just run away</i>
<i>and leave me to deal with the mess.</i>

54:16.866 --> 54:19.244
[woman on recording]
<i>What if this life is just a dream?</i>

54:19.327 --> 54:22.872
Can I borrow your truck? Just for...
I have to go get some stuff.

55:14.173 --> 55:16.092
[woman] As far as our records indicate,

55:16.175 --> 55:19.304
we've had 23 patients
with the name Phillips on file.

55:22.015 --> 55:24.976
-How accurate are your records?
-Accurate.

55:26.519 --> 55:28.354
I would love to see that list.

55:28.813 --> 55:30.690
Mm. I'm sure you would.

56:23.409 --> 56:24.369
What the fuck?

56:30.667 --> 56:32.168
Are you looking for something?

56:34.295 --> 56:35.880
Maybe you can help me. Um...

56:37.006 --> 56:40.176
-Did there used to be a hallway here?
-Used to.

56:40.760 --> 56:42.512
They did a little remodeling.

56:43.805 --> 56:45.848
Took their sweet-ass time with it, too.

56:47.975 --> 56:50.228
I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel?

56:51.354 --> 56:52.980
About a decade ago.

57:03.408 --> 57:05.410
[electric guitar playing gently]

57:28.141 --> 57:29.142
[Isla] Hey.

57:30.059 --> 57:31.602
-Hey.
-Where have you been?

57:34.689 --> 57:36.691
This is, uh... This is interesting.

57:45.241 --> 57:46.701
Okay, thank you, Toby.

57:47.577 --> 57:48.661
Thank you, my boy.

57:51.581 --> 57:52.999
Well, hello to you all.

57:54.459 --> 57:55.752
As always, it's a pleasure.

57:57.420 --> 57:59.881
When you all first got here, you...

58:00.840 --> 58:03.134
You used this, uh, piece of equipment.

58:04.385 --> 58:05.386
The questionnaire.

58:06.763 --> 58:08.931
And your answers are
what allowed you to stay here,

58:09.015 --> 58:12.143
so, basically... a trust was built.

58:13.352 --> 58:15.563
But lately, I'm beginning to wonder

58:15.646 --> 58:18.441
if perhaps we're getting
just a little too comfortable here.

58:19.525 --> 58:21.235
There's a lot of loose talk going on.

58:22.320 --> 58:25.865
And it makes me think that
we just might be losing a little focus.

58:29.243 --> 58:30.620
Lacey, would you join me, please?

58:39.587 --> 58:41.714
-What's going on?
-It's okay. Relax.

58:42.590 --> 58:44.967
Would you like to tell us
how long you've been here?

58:47.095 --> 58:49.972
Um... just over a year.

58:50.056 --> 58:52.141
Just over a year.
You were one of the first.

58:52.600 --> 58:55.103
How have you been treated?
Have you been treated well?

58:55.186 --> 58:58.022
-Have I been good to you?
-You've been wonderful.

58:58.940 --> 59:01.651
-Why are you talking to me like this?
-I've been wonderful.

59:02.610 --> 59:06.447
If I've been wonderful, then why are you
telling your peers about the device,

59:06.531 --> 59:09.992
and particularly...
why are you saying it failed?

59:13.121 --> 59:13.955
Speak up.

59:16.582 --> 59:17.583
Um...

59:20.336 --> 59:21.212
It's okay.

59:22.547 --> 59:24.173
I just told one person.

59:25.842 --> 59:28.970
It slipped out when I had mentioned
how the new girl was invited.

59:30.346 --> 59:31.264
[Harber] You mean Isla.

59:32.598 --> 59:35.226
You were displeased
when I invited her here, weren't you?

59:35.935 --> 59:39.605
It's just that some people who have been
here much longer weren't asked.

59:40.731 --> 59:42.567
Tell everyone where I found you.

59:44.360 --> 59:45.611
Thomas.

59:46.112 --> 59:47.029
It's okay.

59:47.947 --> 59:49.282
This is a safe place.

59:56.330 --> 59:57.331
In the woods.

01:00:00.793 --> 01:00:01.627
Go on.

01:00:07.758 --> 01:00:09.010
I had a gun.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.597
And where was that gun aimed?

01:00:16.225 --> 01:00:17.476
At my chest.

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:20.438
Right next to your heart.

01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:25.568
Usually, it's the head...
or the barrel goes into the mouth.

01:00:25.651 --> 01:00:28.654
I don't know that I've ever seen it
done that way before.

01:00:30.948 --> 01:00:31.949
I'm sorry.

01:00:35.244 --> 01:00:37.038
Please don't lose faith in me.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.040
"Faith."

01:00:40.333 --> 01:00:43.419
Oh, God.
I have such contempt for that word.

01:00:43.502 --> 01:00:45.421
Show me someone who relies on faith

01:00:45.504 --> 01:00:47.548
and I'll show you someone
who's given up control

01:00:47.632 --> 01:00:49.008
over whatever it is they believe.

01:00:49.091 --> 01:00:51.135
Sorry, there's nothing more
I can do for you.

01:00:51.219 --> 01:00:52.345
Thomas, please.

01:00:52.428 --> 01:00:54.972
Pack up your belongings.
Say your goodbyes.

01:01:19.497 --> 01:01:21.165
That was a hell of a show out there.

01:01:23.251 --> 01:01:24.377
Come on, Will.

01:01:25.503 --> 01:01:27.755
You think I don't know a lot
of this is bullshit?

01:01:27.838 --> 01:01:31.342
You give meaning to people who think
they have no more reason to live.

01:01:31.425 --> 01:01:34.595
The jumpsuit, the chain of command,
the theatrics.

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:38.349
It gives them purpose.
And I care about them.

01:01:38.432 --> 01:01:41.018
Yeah. Someone should tell that to Lacey.

01:01:44.814 --> 01:01:47.650
You... You can pretend all you want

01:01:47.733 --> 01:01:50.861
that the reason you left was
because you stopped approving of my work.

01:01:50.945 --> 01:01:53.155
Work, by the way, that we did together.

01:01:53.864 --> 01:01:57.368
But I think we both know this was never
about the Discovery for you.

01:01:57.451 --> 01:02:00.746
-It was always about your mother.
-Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.

01:02:07.753 --> 01:02:10.923
Just because you wanna pretend
like Mom did not happen...

01:02:11.924 --> 01:02:13.509
doesn't mean that I'm going to.

01:02:19.348 --> 01:02:20.474
[door closes]

01:02:26.605 --> 01:02:28.607
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:30.401 --> 01:02:32.194
-Hey. Can I show you something?
-What?

01:02:32.278 --> 01:02:34.822
-Just come with me. Please.
-Sorry.

01:02:39.994 --> 01:02:40.995
[Isla] Wait.

01:02:41.579 --> 01:02:44.040
-What is this?
-That's what I'm trying to figure out.

01:02:46.292 --> 01:02:49.628
-You were gonna keep this from me?
-No, I'm... I'm showing you now.

01:02:50.838 --> 01:02:52.631
And I was afraid of what you might do.

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:00.139
All right, so, the afterlife...
This is the afterlife?

01:03:00.222 --> 01:03:04.352
How can it be the afterlife if we're
in the same parking lot in that recording?

01:03:04.435 --> 01:03:05.353
Then what is it?

01:03:05.436 --> 01:03:09.148
My theory is that my father invented
something that records memory.

01:03:09.857 --> 01:03:12.485
You've heard him go on and on
about the subconscious.

01:03:13.402 --> 01:03:16.614
I understand that you wanted this
to be something different.

01:03:17.823 --> 01:03:21.035
The proof is overwhelming
that that's a Pat Phillips memory.

01:03:22.703 --> 01:03:25.331
Proof shouldn't be overwhelming.
It should be definitive.

01:03:28.584 --> 01:03:29.585
[beeps]

01:03:37.885 --> 01:03:39.178
Where the fuck are we going?

01:03:40.346 --> 01:03:42.723
[Will] <i>If what we're seeing</i>
<i>on that video happened in real life,</i>

01:03:42.807 --> 01:03:44.350
<i>I'm gonna find out exactly when.</i>

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:48.270
<i>Since this hospital opened, there have</i>
<i>been 23 patients named Phillips.</i>

01:03:49.188 --> 01:03:50.606
But based on the model of his truck,

01:03:50.689 --> 01:03:54.235
I can eliminate any Phillips
from before the year 2000.

01:03:54.527 --> 01:03:57.363
Yeah, but even after 2000,
doesn't that leave a lot of names?

01:03:57.446 --> 01:03:59.156
That hospital room doesn't exist anymore,

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.160
so, we can also cross off
any Phillips from the past decade.

01:04:08.582 --> 01:04:10.084
That leaves us with one.

01:04:17.967 --> 01:04:19.093
"Connor Phillips"?

01:04:20.052 --> 01:04:21.011
That's him.

01:04:22.263 --> 01:04:23.764
That's Pat Phillips' dad.

01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:27.226
He died here 13 years ago.

01:04:31.397 --> 01:04:33.357
So, it does just record a memory?

01:04:37.945 --> 01:04:41.365
[Will] It's pretty fucked up
what happened today, huh? With Lacey?

01:04:41.449 --> 01:04:43.117
She spoke out of turn.

01:04:44.493 --> 01:04:47.788
And she knew the rules.
She basically helped write them.

01:04:47.872 --> 01:04:49.623
It's just you and me talking.

01:04:50.624 --> 01:04:52.042
You don't believe that.

01:04:52.626 --> 01:04:54.587
Stop telling me what I believe, Will.

01:04:58.424 --> 01:05:02.261
Proving the existence of an afterlife
destroyed Dad's own life.

01:05:02.344 --> 01:05:04.096
That's what I believe.

01:05:05.014 --> 01:05:07.433
Yeah... everybody else's, too.

01:05:07.683 --> 01:05:09.351
Dad has no intention...

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:12.730
of showing anything the machine records
with the outside world.

01:05:12.813 --> 01:05:17.526
That's why he lost it
when Lacey told people.

01:05:18.235 --> 01:05:20.905
If he has no intention
of showing what it does to anybody,

01:05:20.988 --> 01:05:23.991
why is he doing it, huh? What's the point?

01:05:24.617 --> 01:05:25.868
"Why is he doing it?"

01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:28.787
[chuckles]

01:05:28.871 --> 01:05:30.122
"Why is he doing it?"

01:05:31.165 --> 01:05:32.082
Let's see.

01:05:34.877 --> 01:05:35.878
Well...

01:05:37.922 --> 01:05:40.841
he'll tell you
about the millions of people who died,

01:05:40.925 --> 01:05:43.594
and he'll tell you about
finishing his work to honor them.

01:05:45.137 --> 01:05:46.764
I heard that yesterday.

01:05:46.847 --> 01:05:49.433
I've been hearing that
for the past two years now.

01:05:51.936 --> 01:05:53.062
[Toby chuckles]

01:05:53.145 --> 01:05:57.441
And I just... smile and nod and agree...

01:05:59.568 --> 01:06:02.321
like the idiot son,
but I do understand things.

01:06:05.658 --> 01:06:07.535
I know Mom died...

01:06:08.452 --> 01:06:10.663
Not died. She killed herself.

01:06:12.456 --> 01:06:14.500
She killed herself.

01:06:16.418 --> 01:06:18.546
And when you look...

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.925
at what Dad spent his life working on,

01:06:23.259 --> 01:06:29.098
and when you look at the way
Mom killed herself, how she did it...

01:06:31.308 --> 01:06:37.648
how would Dad not feel a little anger
on top of his guilt?

01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:41.151
Hmm?

01:06:43.153 --> 01:06:46.240
Dad does need... to know.

01:06:47.992 --> 01:06:50.327
He needs to know
that she made it somewhere.

01:06:54.915 --> 01:06:56.542
He overreacted, that's all.

01:06:58.043 --> 01:07:02.965
He'll come to his senses,
and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.

01:07:08.512 --> 01:07:10.389
Dad always comes to his senses.

01:07:21.483 --> 01:07:22.610
It's not a memory, Will.

01:07:24.028 --> 01:07:24.862
What?

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:28.991
[Isla] On his left arm in that exact spot,
there was a different tattoo.

01:07:29.074 --> 01:07:31.785
-[Will] How is that possible?
-I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.

01:07:31.869 --> 01:07:34.038
It wasn't a lighthouse.
It was waves on his arm.

01:07:34.788 --> 01:07:36.165
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

01:07:36.415 --> 01:07:38.500
It's not a memory.
This is something else.

01:07:39.627 --> 01:07:41.420
If it's not a memory, then what is it?

01:07:44.673 --> 01:07:46.675
Everything we've seen
doesn't exist anymore.

01:07:46.759 --> 01:07:50.554
I mean, the hospital room's gone,
Pat Phillips, obviously gone.

01:07:52.306 --> 01:07:55.225
We need to find something in this video
that still exists.

01:07:57.770 --> 01:08:00.439
The... The woman. There's a...

01:08:03.651 --> 01:08:04.526
Her.

01:08:06.278 --> 01:08:08.947
We have Connor Phillips' address
on his death certificate.

01:08:09.031 --> 01:08:12.076
So, I say that we go
down there tomorrow...

01:08:13.118 --> 01:08:15.621
and we see if somebody
can help us track her down.

01:08:30.094 --> 01:08:31.804
Will, why are we back here?

01:08:32.095 --> 01:08:35.140
I don't know what's waiting for us
at that house, and I...

01:08:38.519 --> 01:08:42.147
Do you remember I told you
about my accident when I was a kid?

01:08:42.606 --> 01:08:45.359
Yeah, when you lied to your mom
about what you saw.

01:08:45.442 --> 01:08:46.276
I didn't lie.

01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:49.071
I didn't lie.

01:08:50.906 --> 01:08:51.907
[sighs]

01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:54.535
This is where I saw whatever...

01:08:55.577 --> 01:08:57.912
Whatever it is that I saw.
This is the beach.

01:09:01.457 --> 01:09:06.046
I used to come here when I was a kid,
like... I was drawn to it.

01:09:07.673 --> 01:09:09.425
Or it made me feel better.

01:09:11.593 --> 01:09:13.220
Anyway... Um...

01:09:14.179 --> 01:09:19.059
when I saw you walking into the water
the other day, that's...

01:09:19.143 --> 01:09:20.519
That's why I was here.

01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:26.984
What?

01:10:06.064 --> 01:10:07.024
I had a son...

01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:13.572
and he was five years old.

01:10:17.534 --> 01:10:18.786
And I fell asleep...

01:10:21.288 --> 01:10:23.123
just for a second.

01:10:26.376 --> 01:10:28.587
And when I woke up, he was gone.

01:11:04.665 --> 01:11:09.211
At first I thought I wasn't supposed
to meet you... or feel anything.

01:11:13.465 --> 01:11:14.883
But maybe I was wrong.

01:11:34.361 --> 01:11:35.779
[Will sighs]

01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:51.670
Um, hi. Is this the Phillips residence?

01:11:52.671 --> 01:11:54.798
Connor... Did you know Connor Phillips?

01:11:55.382 --> 01:11:57.843
Pat Phillips? Can you speak English?

01:12:00.804 --> 01:12:01.930
Okay.

01:12:02.014 --> 01:12:04.600
Okay, well, that's clearly not the woman
from the video.

01:12:06.476 --> 01:12:08.020
Maybe they moved or something.

01:12:08.228 --> 01:12:10.188
Should we see
if they have the new address?

01:12:10.272 --> 01:12:12.399
I don't know. I don't know.

01:12:15.611 --> 01:12:16.612
Can I help you?

01:12:21.575 --> 01:12:23.201
I haven't seen my brother in years.

01:12:23.869 --> 01:12:25.829
I'd call it more of a loss for her
than for me.

01:12:28.123 --> 01:12:29.166
Alzheimer's.

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.877
She deteriorated after Dad died.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:33.712
-Connor?
-You knew my father, too?

01:12:33.795 --> 01:12:38.800
You know, actually, Pat mentioned him.
That he went to see him before he died.

01:12:39.384 --> 01:12:41.219
Well, anyway, Dad died and...

01:12:42.137 --> 01:12:45.474
Mom, she started going downhill
real fast after that.

01:12:46.433 --> 01:12:48.810
My husband and I, we own the house now.

01:12:49.436 --> 01:12:52.439
Is there gonna be a service or anything,
um, for Pat?

01:12:53.023 --> 01:12:53.857
I wouldn't know.

01:12:55.525 --> 01:12:57.486
I'm sorry, if you don't mind me saying,

01:12:57.569 --> 01:13:00.405
you don't seem that upset
about your brother's death.

01:13:01.448 --> 01:13:02.616
[sighing] Look...

01:13:03.367 --> 01:13:06.244
it seems as though you liked him.
You found something in him...

01:13:07.162 --> 01:13:08.330
so, I'm sorry.

01:13:09.706 --> 01:13:13.293
But to the rest of us...
he was a piece of shit

01:13:13.377 --> 01:13:16.254
who left his sister
with a cancer-ridden father

01:13:16.338 --> 01:13:19.341
and a mother
who lost every marble she ever had.

01:13:21.259 --> 01:13:25.138
I'm sorry. So... [clears throat]
is the last time that you saw Pat

01:13:25.222 --> 01:13:27.391
when he went to visit
your Dad in the hospital?

01:13:27.474 --> 01:13:30.560
I don't know what bullshit
he hauled your way,

01:13:30.644 --> 01:13:33.230
but he never visited my father
in the hospital.

01:13:33.313 --> 01:13:34.982
If he told you that, it's a lie.

01:13:36.942 --> 01:13:40.487
He called and said he was gonna visit him,
but he never showed up.

01:13:41.571 --> 01:13:44.866
This is gonna sound really strange,
but did Pat have a tattoo?

01:13:45.409 --> 01:13:46.535
He told you about that?

01:13:48.245 --> 01:13:49.121
Well...

01:13:53.458 --> 01:13:56.837
When he turned 18,
we got matching waves.

01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:00.215
We were really close then.

01:14:09.891 --> 01:14:13.186
So, the machine doesn't record a memory.
It wasn't a bad theory.

01:14:15.856 --> 01:14:17.816
People are just gonna
keep killing themselves.

01:14:18.358 --> 01:14:21.653
You know, sooner or later,
you're gonna have to forgive your dad.

01:14:22.946 --> 01:14:26.283
I've been thinking a lot
about the difference between...

01:14:27.409 --> 01:14:29.661
what something is
and what something means.

01:14:31.204 --> 01:14:33.040
And I don't know what any of this is...

01:14:34.791 --> 01:14:37.252
but I do think
if there's a meaning to any of it,

01:14:37.335 --> 01:14:40.380
it has something to do
with not pressing the reset button,

01:14:40.464 --> 01:14:42.424
even if things get really rough.

01:14:56.229 --> 01:15:00.776
We're a bunch of people running around,
making the same mistakes over and over.

01:15:01.818 --> 01:15:04.988
And I don't know why we think
it'll be different somewhere else...

01:15:06.490 --> 01:15:09.076
unless we learn what we're supposed to
while we're here.

01:15:20.253 --> 01:15:21.254
[Isla sighs]

01:15:29.221 --> 01:15:30.722
What was your son's name?

01:15:33.725 --> 01:15:34.559
Oliver.

01:15:39.898 --> 01:15:41.024
I was dreaming.

01:15:43.401 --> 01:15:45.237
When he was in the water,
I was dreaming.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.240
What about?

01:15:50.575 --> 01:15:51.409
I don't know.

01:15:53.245 --> 01:15:54.287
I can't remember.

01:15:56.790 --> 01:16:00.752
It was one of those times where you know
for sure you're dreaming, but you don't...

01:16:01.878 --> 01:16:03.004
don't know what about.

01:16:07.092 --> 01:16:08.093
I wish I knew.

01:16:16.810 --> 01:16:20.397
You don't have to do this alone anymore
if you don't want to.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.274
[Toby] Will!

01:17:06.318 --> 01:17:07.736
Fuck! Fuck, Will!

01:17:09.112 --> 01:17:11.448
Get up. It's Dad.
What the fuck are you doing?

01:17:11.948 --> 01:17:12.949
What about Dad?

01:17:13.033 --> 01:17:15.660
-It's dad. Get the fuck up.
-Okay. All right. I'm coming.

01:17:17.996 --> 01:17:20.457
I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it.

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.584
Slow down
and tell me exactly what happened.

01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:26.546
He hooked himself up to the device.
He wanted to prove that it works.

01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:28.131
-Dad's hooked up right now?
-Yes.

01:17:28.215 --> 01:17:30.217
[Isla] We need to tell him that it works.

01:17:30.675 --> 01:17:31.551
What?

01:17:32.719 --> 01:17:33.553
What works?

01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:36.514
-What are you doing?
-He demanded.

01:17:36.598 --> 01:17:39.434
-Why aren't you bringing him back?
-He's too far along.

01:17:39.517 --> 01:17:41.269
We already know that it records something.

01:17:41.353 --> 01:17:42.270
Cooper...

01:17:42.854 --> 01:17:44.147
it works, okay?

01:17:46.107 --> 01:17:46.942
Dad?

01:17:47.817 --> 01:17:48.652
Dad?

01:17:48.735 --> 01:17:50.445
[woman] <i>Time to pull yourself away.</i>

01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:55.408
<i>Come back to reality. Come home.</i>

01:17:57.619 --> 01:17:59.746
-Is that Mom?
-It's Mom.

01:18:00.789 --> 01:18:02.415
[Harber] <i>What I'm doing is reality.</i>

01:18:05.043 --> 01:18:07.504
<i>I need to finish.</i>
<i>It's important. Do you understand?</i>

01:18:08.546 --> 01:18:10.548
-Their anniversary.
-Yeah.

01:18:12.259 --> 01:18:13.677
[woman] <i>I'm going upstairs.</i>

01:18:19.349 --> 01:18:23.353
[Harber] <i>Now, don't be dramatic.</i>
<i>I'll be done soon. And we can have dinner.</i>

01:18:41.496 --> 01:18:42.414
[Harber] <i>Honey, wait.</i>

01:18:46.751 --> 01:18:50.463
<i>Maybe work can wait.</i>
<i>So, what do you say we have some dinner?</i>

01:19:03.059 --> 01:19:04.269
She's not taking the bath.

01:19:04.352 --> 01:19:05.687
-That's not what happened.
-I know.

01:19:07.022 --> 01:19:08.273
We can bring him back.

01:19:08.356 --> 01:19:11.109
Cooper, just... wait.
We have to see what happens.

01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:13.778
[Cooper] We've got to do it now,
or it'll be too late.

01:19:14.321 --> 01:19:16.156
Will, come on.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.328
Toby, I'm sorry. Cooper, now!

01:19:22.954 --> 01:19:25.290
-Dad? Dad, listen to me.
-[defibrillator shocks]

01:19:25.373 --> 01:19:27.625
Dad, please. Listen to my voice.

01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:30.211
-Is he gonna be brain...?
-I don't know. I don't know.

01:19:30.295 --> 01:19:31.296
Cooper, hit it again!

01:19:31.629 --> 01:19:32.630
[defibrillator shocks]

01:19:33.631 --> 01:19:34.591
Dad?

01:19:34.674 --> 01:19:36.676
[machine beeping]

01:19:39.429 --> 01:19:40.263
What happened?

01:19:54.569 --> 01:19:55.653
I knew I saw her.

01:19:58.156 --> 01:20:00.950
Like a dream that you can't remember.

01:20:02.702 --> 01:20:04.412
I can't figure out what this is, Dad.

01:20:05.413 --> 01:20:08.416
I never left my study.
Never stopped her on the stairs.

01:20:11.127 --> 01:20:14.005
-And she drew a bath.
-[Will] I know.

01:20:14.589 --> 01:20:17.759
And in the Pat Phillips recording,
he has a different tattoo on his arm.

01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:21.721
[Harber] I always said the afterlife
was a different plane of existence.

01:20:23.223 --> 01:20:24.391
But...

01:20:26.476 --> 01:20:30.397
what if it's a different plane...
of this existence?

01:20:32.941 --> 01:20:34.317
Alternate realities?

01:20:34.776 --> 01:20:38.655
No, our reality...
with differences and variations.

01:20:39.697 --> 01:20:43.660
Stepping out of a truck...
to visit a dying parent.

01:20:44.786 --> 01:20:47.664
<i>Random, like different tattoos.</i>

01:20:49.082 --> 01:20:52.544
Stopping someone from going upstairs
to end their life.

01:20:57.757 --> 01:21:02.470
When we die, what if we travel
to an alternate version of our own life?

01:21:03.054 --> 01:21:04.097
A second chance?

01:21:05.515 --> 01:21:09.436
Then we wouldn't... just have to accept
our biggest regret.

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:12.730
In the afterlife, we could change it.

01:21:15.442 --> 01:21:19.737
At the risk of stating
the super fucking obvious...

01:21:20.947 --> 01:21:23.950
if you are right
and word of this got out--

01:21:24.033 --> 01:21:25.493
We have to destroy the machine.

01:21:38.590 --> 01:21:39.591
[Cooper] Hey, Thomas.

01:21:40.967 --> 01:21:43.178
Everyone wants to know what's going on.

01:21:47.515 --> 01:21:50.727
Welcome, everybody.
Nice to have you all here.

01:21:51.895 --> 01:21:56.608
I asked you to gather here today because
I thought that we should be honest.

01:21:56.691 --> 01:21:58.651
-Hi.
-Honest with ourselves,

01:21:58.735 --> 01:22:00.111
honest with each other.

01:22:00.195 --> 01:22:02.071
-You got to see your mom again.
-[Harber] I see you as family...

01:22:02.155 --> 01:22:04.115
and I think you see me
in the same way.

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.367
And as family...

01:22:07.869 --> 01:22:10.079
I think sometimes
we get so absorbed with...

01:22:10.622 --> 01:22:14.209
what we're doing individually,
we go off on our own track and so forth,

01:22:14.292 --> 01:22:17.212
we lose the fact
that how important family is.

01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:19.255
-[gunshot]
-[all gasp]

01:22:22.091 --> 01:22:22.926
Lacey?

01:22:25.345 --> 01:22:26.638
Lacey.

01:22:27.263 --> 01:22:30.767
Lacey, it's okay. Put the...
Put the gun down.

01:22:30.850 --> 01:22:33.811
Lacey, I was wrong.
You do not need to do this.

01:22:34.395 --> 01:22:35.605
I didn't kill her.

01:22:39.192 --> 01:22:41.152
I just relocated her.

01:22:44.405 --> 01:22:45.281
[Will] Isla?

01:22:47.534 --> 01:22:48.409
Isla?

01:22:48.993 --> 01:22:50.119
Isla. Oh, it's okay.

01:22:50.203 --> 01:22:52.914
Isla? Dad! Oh, God.

01:22:53.498 --> 01:22:54.958
Dad, please! I need your help!

01:22:55.959 --> 01:22:57.502
[woman] Somebody go get help.

01:22:58.503 --> 01:23:00.338
[panting] I just wanted my spot back.

01:23:00.421 --> 01:23:02.298
Okay. Okay.

01:23:04.884 --> 01:23:06.469
[Will] Isla. Dad, please help her.

01:23:07.679 --> 01:23:09.180
Don't talk. Just breathe.

01:23:10.306 --> 01:23:11.516
I don't wanna die anymore.

01:23:14.394 --> 01:23:17.355
[muffled] You're okay.
I just need you to stay with me.

01:23:29.867 --> 01:23:30.868
[boy] Yeah. Ha!

01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:36.541
[Will mutters]

01:23:41.588 --> 01:23:42.463
Isla?

01:23:43.756 --> 01:23:44.591
Isla?

01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:47.320
[Toby] <i>They were asking, the cops,</i>
<i>who to contact for Isla.</i>

01:24:47.403 --> 01:24:50.990
<i>-Next-of-kin deal.</i>
<i>-</i> [Harber] <i>I'll have Cooper look into it.</i>

01:24:51.074 --> 01:24:52.158
[Toby] <i>Okay.</i>

01:24:53.201 --> 01:24:56.454
I don't wanna overwhelm him
with questions right now, okay?

01:24:56.537 --> 01:24:58.623
Okay. Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

01:24:58.706 --> 01:24:59.707
Yeah.

01:24:59.791 --> 01:25:03.836
-Maybe I should go in and check on him--
-No, no, no. Don't.

01:25:05.004 --> 01:25:05.880
He needs rest.

01:25:07.006 --> 01:25:08.299
He needs to process, okay?

01:25:08.383 --> 01:25:10.802
-All right.
-You can check on him after dinner.

01:25:12.428 --> 01:25:15.014
And then we'll finish breaking down
the machine tonight.

01:25:15.098 --> 01:25:15.932
[Toby] Okay.

01:25:18.017 --> 01:25:18.851
But...

01:25:19.602 --> 01:25:22.772
we haven't come close...

01:25:23.564 --> 01:25:27.276
to figuring this all out yet,
or what it all means.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:31.698
Like, if it really is another version
of our own life,

01:25:31.781 --> 01:25:35.576
then what happens when we die again?

01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:36.494
[Harber] Toby.

01:25:37.412 --> 01:25:38.413
-Toby.
-What?

01:25:39.122 --> 01:25:40.957
[Harber] We've got to let it go
for a while.

01:25:42.542 --> 01:25:43.376
We've just got to.

01:25:55.513 --> 01:25:56.764
[grunting]

01:26:02.311 --> 01:26:03.938
[Harber] <i>Completely dismantled.</i>

01:26:04.021 --> 01:26:06.566
-All traces need to be gone.
-Thomas, I hear you.

01:26:15.658 --> 01:26:17.493
[panting]

01:26:21.664 --> 01:26:22.790
[grunts]

01:26:27.962 --> 01:26:28.963
[Harber] William?

01:26:29.922 --> 01:26:31.591
Let us in, don't do this.

01:26:32.967 --> 01:26:33.843
William.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.986
[machine beeping]

01:27:40.785 --> 01:27:42.495
He's on the ferry headed here?

01:27:42.578 --> 01:27:44.872
-Not the same here.
-What?

01:27:47.917 --> 01:27:52.088
I don't understand. How are we watching
this right now if he's not dead?

01:27:52.171 --> 01:27:57.009
[man on TV] <i>...since Thomas Harber's first</i>
<i>and only post-Discovery interview ended</i>

01:27:57.093 --> 01:27:58.678
<i>with an on-air suicide.</i>

01:27:59.262 --> 01:28:02.640
<i>Since then,</i>
<i>the worldwide suicide toll has sky--</i>

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.769
[Isla] I was watching that.

01:28:10.565 --> 01:28:11.399
Isla?

01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:14.068
-Isla?
-[Isla] It's off-season.

01:28:14.151 --> 01:28:16.904
-Why are you going to this dreary island?
-Isla?

01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:23.703
-I have to stop your shooting, Isla.
-Sit down.

01:28:23.786 --> 01:28:25.580
I need you to come with me right now.

01:28:25.663 --> 01:28:28.875
Sit down, Will. This is just your memory.
I'm a part of you. Sit down.

01:28:31.210 --> 01:28:34.255
What are we doing back on this ferry?
What the fuck is going on?

01:28:35.006 --> 01:28:38.593
You were never able to stop me
from killing myself until this life.

01:28:40.011 --> 01:28:42.972
"This life"? What do you...?
What do you mean, "this life"?

01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:46.267
You always start back on the ferry.

01:28:47.643 --> 01:28:49.520
[Will] <i>Reality and fantasy</i>
<i>are mutually exclusive.</i>

01:28:49.604 --> 01:28:51.439
<i>They don't exist in the same space.</i>

01:28:51.522 --> 01:28:53.024
Well, it looks like we're here.

01:28:55.651 --> 01:28:58.613
You know what? I changed my mind.
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:01.782
[Isla] <i>The first time,</i>
<i>you never got off the ferry.</i>

01:29:02.366 --> 01:29:06.078
<i>Then the next day you read that</i>
<i>a woman named Isla had drowned herself.</i>

01:29:07.163 --> 01:29:08.956
You went on and lived your life,

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:12.877
but the thought that you could've done
something never left. It was always there.

01:29:27.475 --> 01:29:29.477
[brakes squeak]

01:29:31.312 --> 01:29:34.273
[Isla] <i>And then one day,</i>
<i>just like everybody else...</i>

01:29:40.279 --> 01:29:41.530
I died.

01:29:41.614 --> 01:29:43.282
And then you came back here.

01:29:45.951 --> 01:29:48.663
How long have I been stuck living
in this loop?

01:29:50.206 --> 01:29:52.375
How many times have we met
on this ferry?

01:29:54.752 --> 01:29:56.253
Your death brings you back here.

01:29:56.337 --> 01:30:00.508
<i>You keep coming back</i>
<i>over and over again and again.</i>

01:30:02.009 --> 01:30:05.596
I don't remember any of it.
I don't remember these other lives.

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.682
Nobody can remember them directly.

01:30:09.058 --> 01:30:12.103
But sometimes certain memories
do have a way of sticking out.

01:30:12.645 --> 01:30:15.064
[Will] <i>You look so familiar to me.</i>
<i>You look so familiar to me.</i>

01:30:15.648 --> 01:30:17.817
It's your lucky day.
I don't normally carry these around.

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:20.778
-This is where I saw whatever...
-[Will] <i>This is the beach.</i>

01:30:20.861 --> 01:30:23.739
[Toby] How'd you know this is
where you were gonna be staying?

01:30:23.823 --> 01:30:25.616
[Will] <i>We're a bunch of people</i>
<i>running around</i>

01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.076
<i>making the same mistakes</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

01:30:27.159 --> 01:30:30.996
And I just don't know why we think
it's gonna be different someplace else.

01:30:31.914 --> 01:30:33.416
What am I supposed to change?

01:30:33.958 --> 01:30:37.086
You already changed it.
You kept coming back until you saved me.

01:30:37.169 --> 01:30:38.963
I didn't save you, you died.

01:30:39.046 --> 01:30:41.298
There's more than one way
to save somebody, Will.

01:30:41.799 --> 01:30:45.261
[Harber] <i>Cooper, ready on our end.</i>
<i>We need to bring him back.</i>

01:30:46.137 --> 01:30:49.306
How can I hear my dad?
He's in a different place.

01:30:49.390 --> 01:30:51.434
Two separate parts in the same place.

01:30:51.517 --> 01:30:53.394
[Toby] <i>Okay, Dad, defibrillator's charged.</i>

01:30:53.477 --> 01:30:57.022
No, no, no. I'm not ready to go back yet.
I need more time with you.

01:30:57.398 --> 01:30:59.442
Toby, please wait! Not yet!

01:30:59.525 --> 01:31:01.152
[Cooper] <i>His vitals are concerning me.</i>

01:31:01.402 --> 01:31:02.987
<i>If we pull him now, we might lose him.</i>

01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:05.865
Isla. Isla, please.
I'm not ready to leave you.

01:31:06.449 --> 01:31:08.617
-What's happening to me?
-You're about to die.

01:31:08.701 --> 01:31:11.579
[Cooper] <i>His heart's stopped, Thomas.</i>
<i>Organs are shutting down.</i>

01:31:11.662 --> 01:31:13.414
They're trying to bring you back.

01:31:13.497 --> 01:31:16.083
That's okay.
If I die, I'll just come back here to you.

01:31:16.792 --> 01:31:18.127
No, not this time.

01:31:18.878 --> 01:31:20.337
You don't have to come back anymore.

01:31:20.421 --> 01:31:24.091
You helped me get to where I needed to be
and now you'll go someplace else.

01:31:24.967 --> 01:31:27.553
When I get there,
will I be able to remember you?

01:31:28.137 --> 01:31:29.013
I hope so.

01:31:29.847 --> 01:31:32.099
[Toby] <i>Dad, everything is shutting down.</i>

01:31:32.183 --> 01:31:33.934
<i>His brain's showing barely</i>
<i>any activity.</i>

01:31:34.018 --> 01:31:35.561
You're leaving now. This is it.

01:31:35.644 --> 01:31:38.606
[Harber] <i>I'm not leaving this room</i>
<i>until we revive my son.</i>

01:31:38.981 --> 01:31:42.693
When I get there...
I'm going to remember you.

01:31:43.277 --> 01:31:45.196
[Harber] <i>We've gotta pull him out</i>
<i>right now.</i>

01:31:45.279 --> 01:31:48.657
<i>One... two... three.</i>

01:31:49.784 --> 01:31:51.786
[monitor flatlines]

01:33:17.496 --> 01:33:18.497
[boy chuckles]

01:33:18.581 --> 01:33:22.209
Oh, hey. Look. You okay?

01:33:23.752 --> 01:33:24.962
-Yeah.
-Hey, come here.

01:33:25.713 --> 01:33:28.674
Let me help you.
Come here, come here. Oh!

01:33:29.425 --> 01:33:30.342
I got you.

01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:31.594
Whoa!

01:33:31.969 --> 01:33:33.137
Whoa!

01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.471
[boy laughing]

01:33:34.555 --> 01:33:35.431
You okay?

01:33:36.056 --> 01:33:37.641
-Holy cow.
-Give me that pail.

01:33:37.975 --> 01:33:40.477
-You went down pretty good, huh?
-Yeah.

01:33:40.561 --> 01:33:43.606
Yep. You okay? I got you.

01:33:44.732 --> 01:33:46.275
Whoa! [grunts]

01:33:46.692 --> 01:33:47.860
Where's your mom and dad?

01:33:48.444 --> 01:33:49.361
Oliver!

01:33:50.195 --> 01:33:51.071
Oliver!

01:33:52.907 --> 01:33:53.741
Hi.

01:33:56.201 --> 01:33:58.037
It's okay. He's all right. He just...

01:33:58.787 --> 01:34:00.623
-Okay.
-I told you, you can't--

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:04.168
You can't just run off on me like that,
okay? I've told you.

01:34:05.044 --> 01:34:07.588
He was... He was just... He's all right.

01:34:07.838 --> 01:34:09.840
He was struggling a little bit
in the water.

01:34:10.215 --> 01:34:12.051
I wanted to make sure he got back to you.

01:34:12.927 --> 01:34:14.553
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.389
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:34:18.182 --> 01:34:19.725
He's a good kid.

01:34:20.142 --> 01:34:21.393
-You're okay.
-Thanks.

01:34:21.977 --> 01:34:23.145
[Will chuckles]

01:34:25.147 --> 01:34:26.899
[Isla] You can't do that. You scared me.

01:34:27.816 --> 01:34:29.443
