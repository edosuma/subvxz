WEBVTT

00:06.965 --> 00:08.884
Dana! There you are.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.678
Where's Ian?
I thought you two were attached at the--

00:11.762 --> 00:12.763
Ear.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.806
-Hi, Ian.
-Hi, Pop.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.100
He says, "Hi, Pop." Do you need something?

00:17.184 --> 00:20.062
Yes.
I finally finished my expanded prototype,

00:20.145 --> 00:22.606
and I want you
to be the first one to play it.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.066
-Love to.
-He said he'd love to.

00:24.149 --> 00:29.446
No, not Ian. God, I am so past giving
a shit what he thinks about my game.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.365
No, I'm talking about you, Dana.

00:32.448 --> 00:36.453
Wow, I'm so flattered.
I would love to give you my thoughts.

00:36.537 --> 00:41.750
Thoughts? No. Not thoughts. Bugs.
I want you to test Hera.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.253
Way too hot, Pop.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.172
She did just say that to me.
You got that down too?

00:47.256 --> 00:49.424
-Really?
-What?

00:49.508 --> 00:50.551
No, I got it.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.303
Look, Poppy, I'm not a tester anymore.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.514
And besides,
Ian's on his way to pick me up.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.058
-He's speaking with my class today.
-Okay. Well, tell--

00:58.141 --> 01:02.312
And he also says your throat
sounds a little phlegmy

01:02.396 --> 01:04.147
and maybe you should lay off the dairy.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.400
Okay, give me that. Give me-- Give it.

01:07.359 --> 01:09.236
Hello, Ian.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.988
No, I'm fine.

01:11.530 --> 01:14.616
Well, while you're having fun
doing your little project today,

01:14.700 --> 01:17.703
just know that I'm gonna be here
doing what I always do.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.372
No! Not having a breakdown.

01:21.957 --> 01:24.042
No, not begging for approval.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.086
No, not disagreeing with you
for no reason.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.964
Stop telling me what I always do.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.801
What I always do is I get the work done,
and that is what I'm going to do.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.595
And I don't eat too much dairy!

01:34.678 --> 01:36.263
Here, he's your problem now.

01:37.222 --> 01:41.185
Just so you know, once you have him
in your ear, you can never get him out.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.821
Hey, Ian. You almost here?

02:07.252 --> 02:09.128
-Good morning, sir.
-Morning.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.341
Jo, please, you don't have to stand
every time I enter the room.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.800
I'm showing you respect.

02:13.884 --> 02:16.094
And I appreciate that. It's very kind.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.930
It's also very weird.
Makes me feel uncomfortable.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.765
-Please sit.
-Yes, sir.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.141
Hey, sorry I'm late.

02:21.225 --> 02:24.186
You know, my commute from Cerritos
just-- it keeps getting worse and worse.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.270
Mostly because there was

02:25.354 --> 02:28.106
a mentally unstable man in a hoodie
with no bottoms.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.067
And you know, lotta lookie-loos.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.528
Mr. Brittlesbee's office, good morning.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.071
Please hold.

02:34.154 --> 02:38.283
It's someone calling about
Joe Manjaneneh-- Manja-- Man-jann-nyllo?

02:38.367 --> 02:40.786
Joe Manganiello? The True Blood stud?

02:41.370 --> 02:43.747
I guess. He wants to have lunch with you
to talk about the movie.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.083
For real?

02:46.959 --> 02:48.710
Oh, my God,
he could be perfect for the lead role.

02:48.794 --> 02:49.753
I didn't even think of him.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.339
-So what do you want me to say?
-Say yes.

02:53.340 --> 02:57.427
Hello. Yes. I believe Mr. Brittlesbee
can find time in his schedule.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.346
How's 1:00 p.m. today?

02:59.429 --> 03:00.639
What? No. Not today.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.558
No, that's too desperate.
We don't wanna seem desperate.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.393
-Okay, great. 1:00 p.m. it is.
-What?

03:04.476 --> 03:07.479
I'll send some details over to Mr. Manj--

03:07.563 --> 03:09.106
Manganiello. It's Italian.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.525
Nello. I'll send it to you soon. Bye.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.403
Oh, my God. I can't believe he said yes.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.655
He wants to meet today?
That's-- Oh, my God.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.156
He must really want the part.

03:19.825 --> 03:23.620
Oh, my God. This is big, Jo. This is big.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.583
Okay. All right, Jo, I want everything
you can find on Joe Manganiello.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.294
I wanna know where he's from,
where he lives, you know, how big is he?

03:30.377 --> 03:31.879
Is he as big as they say on the Internet?

03:31.962 --> 03:34.423
What drives him, what does he drive?
Does he drive at all?

03:34.506 --> 03:37.384
I wanna know
what this man ate for breakfast.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.304
Although, with his bod,
he probably skips breakfast. I would.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.891
Either way, take some notes,
do some research and get back to me.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.017
Got it?

03:45.100 --> 03:46.894
Cool. And you should be there too.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.563
Yes. That'll be good,
to have an assistant with me.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.523
It's good optics, you know.
Shows that I have power.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.859
And he'll respect that. Cool?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.235
Good.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.446
Also, one quick question.
Why are you bleeding from the mouth?

03:58.572 --> 04:01.408
Sorry, I'm biting my tongue.
Is that better?

04:02.117 --> 04:05.746
A little. Why are you
biting your tongue till you bleed?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.998
David,
I wanna be a good assistant to you, I do.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.876
It's just that I think Hollywood
is a cesspool of narcissism,

04:10.959 --> 04:12.878
sexual deviancy and moral corruption.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.964
Okay, Jo, cou-- Do you mind if I--

04:17.048 --> 04:18.841
Yeah. Look,

04:18.926 --> 04:21.053
we might land
the lead role of our movie today,

04:21.136 --> 04:24.890
so, all I'm asking is that you put aside
your personal beliefs

04:24.973 --> 04:28.060
and you just be the best assistant
you can be today. Be great for me.

04:28.143 --> 04:30.312
-Can you be great for me?
-I can do it for you.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.396
But not for him.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.899
Yeah. Sure. Whatever. Great.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.317
All right, today's gonna be great.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.027
Though this might be a problem.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.321
Yeah, I kinda pitted out
during that phone call.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.329
-Shit.
-You okay?

04:47.412 --> 04:50.624
Yeah, I just--
I don't love being a passenger.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.209
Yeah.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.086
Yeah, me neither. I get that.

04:54.169 --> 04:57.464
And autopilot can fuck all the way off.

04:57.548 --> 05:01.552
I'm supposed to put my life
in this thing's hands? No, thanks.

05:02.594 --> 05:08.392
So you trust yourself over a machine
with instantaneous reaction speeds?

05:10.227 --> 05:12.020
Most people might say
that's pretty arrogant.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.898
Yeah, well,
most people don't know how to drive.

05:15.774 --> 05:16.775
That's weird.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.529
What?

05:21.113 --> 05:23.824
That's almost exactly
what I would have said in that moment.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.328
Weird.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.455
Yeah, weird.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.881
Hey, Carol, bit of an update for ya.

05:38.964 --> 05:42.551
You screwed me, Brad.
The NFT plan was a total bust.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.428
Yeah, saw that.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.597
I mean, the hate I expected,
but the money usually follows.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.348
To be honest, I'm stumped.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.434
Stumped?

05:51.226 --> 05:52.603
Carol, you did it this time.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.982
Put your life in the hands
of an ex-felon turned stumped janitor.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.360
And there is nobody to be mad at
but yourself.

06:00.444 --> 06:01.987
Hi. Excuse me.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.989
Just gonna get a couple CLIF bars
for the road--

06:04.072 --> 06:05.157
-No. No, you ain't.
-Why?

06:05.741 --> 06:08.535
Those are Carol bars
and I need every last one of 'em.

06:08.619 --> 06:11.705
What are you even doing here
with your little, grubby otter hands?

06:11.788 --> 06:15.042
Trying to steal things? You don't even
work here no more. Could you go away?

06:18.462 --> 06:20.380
I'm sorry.

06:20.464 --> 06:24.551
Perhaps it's time for Carol to take
one of her allotted mental health days.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.055
I'm going to a cat café.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.433
Well, I petitioned the company for those,
so you're welcome.

06:31.517 --> 06:32.976
She's so annoying.

06:33.060 --> 06:33.977
What's her problem?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.771
-You're annoying.
-I didn't do anything.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.649
It's your essence. Nothing you can do.
But also our NFTs aren't selling.

06:39.525 --> 06:40.776
I could've told you that.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.946
Gamers hate money grabs.
We can smell it a mile away.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.114
What is this? Strawberry.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.199
Wait, we?

06:49.618 --> 06:50.619
Right.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.998
Hey, what would you have done differently?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.876
I don't know.
Maybe I would've gotten, like, a--

06:58.710 --> 07:03.465
Maybe I would've made, like, a sidequest,
or, like, if you finish it, you get a--

07:03.966 --> 07:08.011
I don't know, like a randomized NFT item,
like a weapon or something,

07:08.095 --> 07:13.225
or maybe like an exclusive skin,
and then you can take that to other games.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.185
Something like that
might've been kinda cool.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.311
It would, huh?

07:17.896 --> 07:20.274
I don't know, man.
This isn't really my job. I just--

07:20.357 --> 07:22.234
-Hey, I was eating that!
-Later.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.071
I can't believe I'm saying this to you,
but keep talking.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.039
What up, grunts?

07:37.291 --> 07:38.292
Hi.

07:39.293 --> 07:43.505
Oh, man. You should see
the looks on your faces.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.257
You're like,

07:45.340 --> 07:46.258
"Holy shit,

07:46.341 --> 07:50.804
did the Poppy Li just walk into
our shitty, little testing cube?"

07:52.472 --> 07:54.391
Yes. Yes, she did.

07:57.186 --> 07:58.770
You have no idea who I am, do you?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.565
You're Poppy Li?

08:01.648 --> 08:07.613
I'm the Poppy Li. The woman
who basically single-handedly built MQ?

08:07.696 --> 08:10.032
Oh, yeah,
she's the one who eats outta the garbage.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.992
-Cat lady.
-Shut up! I'm not a cat lady.

08:12.826 --> 08:17.873
Okay, you two are about to become
a very minor part of gaming history,

08:17.956 --> 08:22.586
because you're about to be
the first people to play my new game.

08:23.587 --> 08:26.632
We'd love to, but we're working right now.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.884
Uh-huh. Yeah, you're working for me.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.678
I told David
that I'd do him a couple of coding favors

08:31.762 --> 08:33.639
in exchange for some bodies
to put on my things.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.642
So, I own you for the day!

08:36.725 --> 08:38.894
I'm sorry, you own us?

08:40.854 --> 08:43.315
No, not like that.
Not-- Stop looking at me like that.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.860
No, we traded you like horses.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.112
So we're animals now?

08:49.196 --> 08:54.201
Shut up! Stop finding bugs in me
and find them in Hera, okay?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.327
If you can.

08:59.831 --> 09:03.710
All right, well, I'll be back
in a few hours to rattle your cages.

09:03.794 --> 09:09.174
Not that. To check on your progress.
Human progress.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.807
Please pick up.

09:20.686 --> 09:21.728
Hi, David, I'm here.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.273
I've got a ton of intel on our target.

09:24.356 --> 09:28.235
I'll debrief you when you get here,
but the headline is he came up clean.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.362
Also, he had a protein shake.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.114
Wait, sorry, what are you talking about?

09:32.197 --> 09:33.699
You wanted to know
what he had for breakfast.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.284
What? No, that was just an expression.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.703
Look, Jo, I'm stuck in Cerritos traffic,

09:37.786 --> 09:39.872
so the navigation says
I'm gonna be a little late.

09:39.955 --> 09:41.081
But I'm not really worried about it.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.166
You know these Hollywood types.
They're never on time.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.459
-He's here.
-What?

09:44.668 --> 09:45.669
Damn it.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.754
-Is he big?
-Super big.

09:47.838 --> 09:48.839
Yeah.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.843
I've been spotted.
I repeat, I have been spotted.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.887
We are making eye contact.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.847
Okay, Jo?

09:56.930 --> 09:59.433
You're gonna have to entertain him
a little bit till I get there.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.601
You said I didn't have to talk!

10:00.684 --> 10:02.561
I know, but you're gonna
have to talk a little, okay?

10:02.644 --> 10:04.938
I don't know what to say to him. I have
nothing in common with west coasters.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.149
You live on the west coast!
Okay, look, it doesn't matter.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.067
Don't-- Just relax, okay? Relax!

10:09.151 --> 10:10.485
Just keep me in your ear, all right?

10:10.569 --> 10:12.362
And I'll stay on the line,

10:12.446 --> 10:13.947
and I'll tell you exactly what to say,
okay?

10:14.031 --> 10:15.365
What? This is getting confusing.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.950
Trust me, it's not gonna be confusing.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.620
-Joe.
-Jo.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.289
-Right.
-Right.

10:23.582 --> 10:24.583
Sorry?

10:24.666 --> 10:26.335
It's confusing. Tell him to sit.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.836
-Sit.
-Not like a dog.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.589
Please. Sit, please.

10:36.803 --> 10:42.100
Okay. And we are here.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.604
Wait, what is this?
My school's 30 minutes away.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.022
Why did the spaceship stop?

10:48.065 --> 10:50.859
Well, right in there they are working on

10:50.943 --> 10:55.030
the most state-of-the-art metaverse
and AR technology in the world.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.156
I want you to see it.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.743
So we're gonna see all the shit
that hasn't come out yet?

11:00.244 --> 11:05.541
Yeah. More than that,
we're gonna help drive the technology.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.543
We dream it. They build it.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.629
That's some real Kevin Costner shit.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.506
-Do you know Field of Dreams?
-Duh.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.301
I-- Can I just take a moment?

11:16.385 --> 11:19.137
I feel seen in a way that I just…

11:19.221 --> 11:22.724
I normally don't.
And I want to take in the moment,

11:22.808 --> 11:24.434
and I want to appreciate it.
So, thank you.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.602
You're welcome.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.687
All right. Let's go.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.772
Wait, we can just walk right in there?

11:28.856 --> 11:31.733
Yeah. Yeah, we're just gonna walk in.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.611
And we're gonna be like,
"Hey, can we see your shit?"

11:34.695 --> 11:35.946
And they're gonna show it to us.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.782
Do you know what I would do
if I were a white guy for a day?

11:38.866 --> 11:41.368
You know what I would do
if I were a Black woman for the day?

11:42.286 --> 11:43.954
-Two words.
-Megan knees.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.541
-Yeah. I was gonna say Megan knees.
-Really?

11:47.624 --> 11:49.793
-Yeah. How did you know that?
-We're in sync. We're, like--

11:49.877 --> 11:51.795
Do we have some sort of,
like, telepathy going?

11:51.879 --> 11:52.713
We do.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.186
Jo? Jo, why is it silent? Say something.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.146
Mr. Brittlesbee will be here shortly.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.148
He just got stuck in traffic coming from--

12:11.231 --> 12:14.610
-Don't say Cerritos.
-Beverly Hills. Where he lives.

12:14.693 --> 12:15.736
Good, Jo. Good.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.696
No worries. Are you a producer too?

12:17.779 --> 12:20.449
-No. I'm the assistant.
-Say "producer."

12:20.532 --> 12:22.910
Producer. On the film.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.494
Assistant producer's a cool gig.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.788
-Say "totally."
-Totally.

12:26.872 --> 12:30.334
And I just have to say
I'm a longtime MQ fan.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.628
I've been playing forever.
Seriously.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.881
I mean, I play a lot of video games,
but MQ is the best.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.967
Really? So you're, like, a nerd?

12:39.051 --> 12:42.387
-No. Don't call him a nerd.
-Yeah. I mean, and proud of it.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.515
Well, tell him I'm a nerd too.

12:44.598 --> 12:45.682
I'm a nerd too.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.101
No, me. Not you.
Tell him, "Mr. Brittlesbee is a nerd."

12:48.185 --> 12:50.812
Cool. I won't tell anyone.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.648
That's a joke. Laugh.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.860
Not weirdly.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.283
Stop everything you're doing.

13:05.494 --> 13:09.248
Don't be sad, Phil.
You crushed it. Killed it. Murdered it.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.000
-But it was all wrong.
-Right.

13:12.084 --> 13:14.795
And now we're gonna be doing
something completely different.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.421
Exactly. Rachel, go.

13:17.923 --> 13:18.924
Me?

13:19.716 --> 13:21.969
Yes, you. Tell him what you told me.

13:25.264 --> 13:26.265
Okay.

13:26.849 --> 13:32.646
So, the reason that no one is buying
the NFTs is because they're shit.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.648
-Oh, my God.
-Seriously?

13:35.983 --> 13:36.984
Great start.

13:38.193 --> 13:40.529
I'm so sorry. Your work isn't shit.

13:40.612 --> 13:43.282
The art is not the problem.
It's the story.

13:43.365 --> 13:48.078
You know, we can't just keep selling items
to players and expect them to be happy.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.914
But if we, you know,
attach it to something they can earn,

13:50.998 --> 13:52.875
something they can, you know,
get for free,

13:52.958 --> 13:54.126
that could be cool.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.129
You know, build the community
and then the money comes later.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.298
Great. So start completely over
with that in mind.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.888
Can you guys give me one second?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.057
I'm just--

14:10.642 --> 14:14.146
So, what were you guys thinking about
the character of the Masked Man?

14:14.730 --> 14:18.358
Well, we're thinking he's…

14:18.442 --> 14:19.568
Say "understated."

14:20.402 --> 14:22.821
-…understated, of course.
-"But fiercely protective."

14:22.905 --> 14:24.239
Also fiercely protective.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.408
Sounds like my Chihuahua.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.410
Another joke. Laugh.

14:28.869 --> 14:33.707
Now, what if…
the Masked Man were German?

14:34.333 --> 14:36.251
Oh, God. Just say "fascinating."

14:36.335 --> 14:37.211
Fascinating.

14:37.294 --> 14:40.589
Guess what I'm pitching
is black-and-white foreign film.

14:40.672 --> 14:41.965
Say "fascinating" again.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.342
Fascinating again.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.301
Yeah.

14:48.722 --> 14:49.806
Not a good time, Phil.

14:49.890 --> 14:52.184
And, by the way, why are you calling
on my personal phone? All right?

14:52.267 --> 14:54.186
If you're calling me about business,
then call me on my "bidness" phone.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.939
Sorry, David,
I'm not sure what to do here.

14:57.022 --> 15:00.609
Am I supposed to be taking orders
from the janitor and his assistant?

15:01.443 --> 15:02.277
What?

15:02.361 --> 15:04.446
I'm not his assistant.
I don't even work here.

15:04.530 --> 15:05.531
Yeah.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.200
The janitor and his friend?

15:08.283 --> 15:09.910
Look, I don't know why
you're bothering me with this right now.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.328
-I do not have time for this.
-Huh?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.871
Sorry, not you.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.333
No, I was just saying,
is it me or is it chilly in here?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.918
-Jo, okay--
-It's Phil.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.962
David doesn't even know who Phil is.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.004
Yeah, shut up, Phil.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.007
-Yeah, I'm a little cold.
-Would you like my jacket?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.844
No, do not take his jacket.
That is a power move.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.804
I'm not gonna be asking him
for his jacket.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.390
I swear to God, I will end you, Phil.
Be quiet.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.559
That's very kind, but I am fine.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.603
I got this.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.566
Where is our waiter? Must not be a fan.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.150
Another joke. Laugh.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.281
David, hey it's Brad.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.574
-Brad?
-Brad?

15:49.283 --> 15:50.284
Brad?

15:50.868 --> 15:54.872
Pitt. Brad Pitt. He's another actor
we're considering for the role.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.582
-What?
-David, just say "approved."

15:56.665 --> 15:58.166
No, do not say that to Joe.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.543
I'm not talking to Jo. I'm talking to you.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.630
I mean, we love Brad for this,
but we would prefer you, of course.

16:03.714 --> 16:04.798
You know he's 5'8", right?

16:06.091 --> 16:09.261
Hire a 5'8" actor, get a 5'8" performance.

16:09.344 --> 16:13.599
I just want the janitor
to pick a direction and stay there.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.934
Oh, my God, Phil,
do not bother me right now!

16:16.018 --> 16:18.437
And never call me on my personal phone!
Only call me on my "bidness"!

16:19.563 --> 16:22.316
You know what? This is weird.

16:22.816 --> 16:25.402
This whole thing is fucking weird.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.739
-Is it?
-Say yes. Just say yes.

16:28.822 --> 16:29.907
Please don't say yes.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.326
Do you guys have genuine interest
in me for this role or no?

16:32.409 --> 16:34.328
Yes, a thousand times yes.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.662
Yes!

16:35.746 --> 16:37.581
Yes. I heard "yes." Thank you, David.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.250
Well, you heard the executive producer.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.961
Looks like we got a "yes."

16:43.045 --> 16:45.380
We'll just check back with you
first thing in the morning. Great?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.343
This seems super shady.

16:49.426 --> 16:50.427
You'll get used to it.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.641
What?

17:01.313 --> 17:04.441
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah. Pretty amazing, right?

17:04.525 --> 17:08.278
The latency fixes, the haptic feedback.
I have so many ideas.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.571
Yeah, me too.
Like, I loved all the AR stuff,

17:10.656 --> 17:14.910
but I feel like we gotta get past glasses.
Like, maybe even past lenses.

17:15.493 --> 17:17.079
What about eye drops?

17:17.162 --> 17:21.375
Like fully augmented reality
with just one drop in each eye.

17:21.458 --> 17:26.505
A neural link comm system where everything
is fluid, free-moving and instantaneous.

17:26.588 --> 17:30.175
Every thought, every idea,
accessible everywhere by anyone

17:30.259 --> 17:33.345
with zero interface
of any kind slowing anything down.

17:34.513 --> 17:36.431
I think that defies the laws of physics.

17:36.515 --> 17:37.599
Who gives a shit?

17:43.355 --> 17:44.356
Oh, my God.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.025
I just got goose bumps.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.528
You did get goose bumps.
How did you do that?

17:50.529 --> 17:51.530
I didn't.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.243
What?

18:00.581 --> 18:02.833
-You're driving back.
-I am?

18:02.916 --> 18:03.917
Yes.

18:20.392 --> 18:22.102
Hey. Keys.

18:26.648 --> 18:30.152
Hey, I'm here. Don't stand.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.988
Where is he? Is he in the bathroom?

18:33.697 --> 18:36.450
-He left.
-Right. No, really. Where is he?

18:37.659 --> 18:38.535
I admitted I lied.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.204
-What? No.
-I said you weren't commuting

18:40.287 --> 18:41.663
-from Beverly Hills.
-No.

18:41.747 --> 18:44.333
That you live far outside of town
and you just got stuck in traffic.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.084
-Why would you do that?
-Because I wanted him to know

18:46.168 --> 18:49.463
that you're a good person,
a great boss and, most importantly,

18:50.047 --> 18:51.340
a young widower from Yorba Linda

18:51.423 --> 18:53.675
dealing with the recent passing
of his loving wife.

18:54.301 --> 18:56.011
-You lied?
-I had to, he was pissed.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.679
It was the only thing I could think of.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.391
All right. Well, what did he say?

19:02.726 --> 19:04.937
He asked where to send flowers.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.065
And he said he wanted to meet you
and talk script.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.983
After the funeral of course.

19:11.068 --> 19:14.947
Wait, so, he's still interested?

19:15.572 --> 19:18.242
Yeah. David, he wants to do it.

19:20.244 --> 19:23.413
Oh, my God, that's incredible.

19:23.497 --> 19:24.790
We bagged a beefcake!

19:24.873 --> 19:30.212
Yes! Yeah. We should celebrate.
Yes. Let's get drunk. Huh?

19:30.295 --> 19:32.381
Actually, David,
you should probably hit the road.

19:32.464 --> 19:35.050
It's getting late and traffic to Cerritos
is only gonna get worse.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.134
But--

19:37.886 --> 19:39.805
Yeah.

19:39.888 --> 19:42.391
You're right. Yep.
This time of day traffic's brutal.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.185
All right, well, back in the car.

19:46.311 --> 19:49.648
Hey, good job.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.405
Hollywood producer. Assistant producer.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.039
Time's up. What you got?

20:06.123 --> 20:07.916
Nothing. Didn't find a single bug.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.587
-See? I told you I was good.
-Yeah, you're top-notch.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.631
Not at picking up on social cues,
but you're an incredible programmer.

20:14.715 --> 20:18.093
Okay, enough. Quit hitting on me.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.471
So, what else did you like about it?

20:22.097 --> 20:23.265
You want our opinions?

20:23.765 --> 20:24.808
Nobody wants our opinions.

20:24.892 --> 20:27.394
-They told us that on the first day.
-And every day since.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.146
Well, yeah. Your opinions are worthless,

20:29.229 --> 20:31.607
but I might find them amusing, so go on.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.777
Well, like we said,
technically speaking it's perfect.

20:35.861 --> 20:37.362
Duh. Obviously.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.323
Architecturally speaking, it's awesome.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.450
Well, tell me something I don't know.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.327
It just wasn't…

20:44.578 --> 20:45.579
Fun.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.542
Fun? Wait. What do you mean? But-- Wait.
Don't-- Press the door open. Fun what?
