00:00.835 --> 00:02.419
[instrumental music]

00:02.461 --> 00:04.713
This feels so decadent.

00:02.461 --> 00:04.713
Isn't this decadent?

00:04.755 --> 00:07.048
- Very decadent.

00:04.755 --> 00:07.048
- Are there more marshmallows?

00:07.090 --> 00:08.717
All you two have been dipping

00:07.090 --> 00:08.717
are the marshmallows.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.260
You haven't touched the kiwi

00:08.759 --> 00:10.260
or the pineapple

00:10.302 --> 00:11.553
or the tangelo slices.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.430
- But it's fruit.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.430
- Fruit is good for you.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.850
- We're fondue purists, grandma.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.850
- Yeah, we dip old school.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.893
The government says

00:15.891 --> 00:17.893
you should have nine servings

00:17.935 --> 00:19.561
of fruit

00:17.935 --> 00:19.561
and vegetables per day.

00:19.603 --> 00:20.813
Imperialist propaganda.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.230
I think Noam Chomsky

00:20.855 --> 00:22.230
would agree.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.607
Yeah, but Noam

00:22.272 --> 00:23.607
doesn't dip fruit.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.066
Or laugh.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.066
Ever seen that punim on him?

00:25.108 --> 00:26.360
Easter island.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.903
Luminista, please bring

00:26.401 --> 00:27.903
more marshmallows.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.822
Bless you.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.365
(Emily)

00:29.864 --> 00:31.365
'So, I'd love to get

00:29.864 --> 00:31.365
your opinion on something.'

00:31.406 --> 00:33.868
- Sure.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.868
- The city ballet's in trouble.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.536
We've given so much

00:33.909 --> 00:35.536
over the years

00:35.577 --> 00:37.162
but it's never enough to cover

00:35.577 --> 00:37.162
everything they need.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.372
I hate that.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.916
So we're trying

00:38.413 --> 00:40.916
something new.

00:40.958 --> 00:42.835
Select patrons,

00:40.958 --> 00:42.835
such as myself

00:42.877 --> 00:45.546
are sponsoring

00:42.877 --> 00:45.546
individual dancers.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.922
- Help me pick one.

00:45.587 --> 00:46.922
- Pick what?

00:46.964 --> 00:48.757
My dancer.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.757
I get to take one home.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.091
Bios are on the back.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.011
- And this is legal?

00:50.133 --> 00:52.011
- Of course, it's legal.

00:52.051 --> 00:53.512
Do you want

00:52.051 --> 00:53.512
a boy or a girl, grandma?

00:53.554 --> 00:55.472
I'm thinking a little girl,

00:53.554 --> 00:55.472
cute and petite.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.850
- They're all petite.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.850
- But not all cute.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.394
This one should fouette

00:57.892 --> 01:00.394
over to the dermatologist.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.812
Oh, yes,

01:00.435 --> 01:01.812
I'd rather not look at that.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.605
Really mom? This is

01:01.854 --> 01:03.605
a little bit creepy.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.900
It's not creepy.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.900
We're endowing dancers.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.443
So they don't have to worry

01:05.941 --> 01:08.443
about money, it's nice.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.405
Well, Gregorio here looks

01:08.485 --> 01:11.405
pretty well endowed already.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.656
Stop that.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.157
Here's a little

01:12.698 --> 01:14.157
cutie-patootie.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.660
Oh, she's darling.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.660
Look at those little feet.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.829
Whoa, you're right.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.829
This Gregorio guy.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.539
- 'What's up with that?'

01:18.871 --> 01:20.539
- Rory!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.457
Just a little girl talk, mom.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.457
Who are we offending?

01:22.499 --> 01:25.168
Let's make two piles. One

01:22.499 --> 01:25.168
for the maybes, one for the nos.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.879
- Sandpaper face is a no?

01:25.210 --> 01:26.879
- Definitely.

01:26.921 --> 01:30.131
What about endowment boy?

01:30.173 --> 01:31.717
- The maybes.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.717
- You go, grandma.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.928
Bet Gregorio would be good

01:31.759 --> 01:33.928
dipped in chocolate.

01:33.969 --> 01:34.929
[chuckles]

01:36.513 --> 01:37.472

02:35.489 --> 02:37.074
I don't know,

02:35.489 --> 02:37.074
adopting a ballet dancer?

02:37.116 --> 02:38.575
The whole thing sounds

02:37.116 --> 02:38.575
very shady.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.494
It's good to support the arts

02:38.617 --> 02:40.494
anyway we can

02:40.535 --> 02:42.037
even the

02:40.535 --> 02:42.037
shady-sounding ones.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.747
Hey, you took my book bag.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.747
I need that.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.290
Oops, sorry.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.042
So, you really think

02:45.332 --> 02:47.042
that transferring your stuff

02:47.084 --> 02:48.836
bit by bit like this

02:47.084 --> 02:48.836
is the way to go, huh?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.671
Easier than renting something?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.671
Doing all at once.

02:50.712 --> 02:54.008
Oh, you really want to relive

02:50.712 --> 02:54.008
the U-Haul incident of May 2004?

02:54.049 --> 02:55.634
Oh, you make one

02:54.049 --> 02:55.634
iffy U-turn.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.511
- We were in a tunnel.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.511
- A wide tunnel.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.637
Going the wrong way

02:57.552 --> 02:58.637
down a one-way street.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.972
They don't let you forget.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.222
Yeah, I've got

03:00.014 --> 03:01.222
that Elephant's memory

03:01.264 --> 03:03.266
when it comes

03:01.264 --> 03:03.266
to nearly dying.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.726
Hey, you took

03:03.308 --> 03:04.726
my book bag again.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.311
Aah!

03:06.353 --> 03:08.563
So, hey, let's finalize

03:06.353 --> 03:08.563
our plans for Thursday.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.858
Right, so, Jackson says

03:08.605 --> 03:10.858
that Sookie has been napping

03:10.899 --> 03:13.192
between 11:00 and 12:30

03:10.899 --> 03:13.192
every day, we can count on it.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.154
It must be nice to nap

03:13.234 --> 03:15.154
without feeling guilty.

03:15.194 --> 03:16.195
Get pregnant,

03:15.194 --> 03:16.195
and you'll have an excuse.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.906
No, thanks.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.658
So, meet me at their house at

03:17.948 --> 03:19.658
noon, bring decorations

03:19.700 --> 03:21.242
and she'll wake up to a nice,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.242
fun, surprise baby shower.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.911
You got it.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.245
'I think it's cool we waited

03:22.953 --> 03:24.245
this long to throw it.'

03:24.287 --> 03:25.622
She's totally not

03:24.287 --> 03:25.622
gonna expect it.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.082
- Plus, we forgot.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.082
- Only we know that.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.458
- I'm not telling.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.458
- Good. Bye, hon.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.919
Bye.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.839
- Mom, my purse.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.839
- Oh, sorry.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.343
Luke, can I have

03:36.758 --> 03:38.343
a word with you?

03:38.385 --> 03:39.427
Yes.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.762
You overcharged me

03:39.469 --> 03:40.762
for the toast.

03:40.804 --> 03:41.889
It's only supposed

03:40.804 --> 03:41.889
to be dollar.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.431
I didn't overcharge you, Kirk.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.143
I raised the price of wheat

03:43.473 --> 03:46.143
toast, it's $1.10.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.770
- You're kidding.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.770
- I don't do toast humor.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.106
$1.10 from $1?

03:48.812 --> 03:51.106
That's a 10% bump.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.316
- It's a dime, kirk.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.316
- I could refuse to pay.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.777
- Then I'll steal your bike.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.777
- That's never worked before.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.446
I haven't raised the price of

03:55.819 --> 03:58.446
my toast in seven years, Kirk.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.614
It's still a bargain.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.201
- I'll give you $1.04.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.201
- No.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.037
- $1.05. That's my last offer.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.037
- Do I look like eBay?

04:05.079 --> 04:07.748
I take my toast dry. Isn't there

04:05.079 --> 04:07.748
a butter-and-jam discount?

04:07.789 --> 04:09.124
- No.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.124
- What about your chairs?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.625
I'm light,

04:09.166 --> 04:10.625
and I tend to plop my butt

04:10.667 --> 04:12.044
directly on

04:10.667 --> 04:12.044
the chair without sliding

04:12.086 --> 04:13.587
so there's practically

04:12.086 --> 04:13.587
no wear and tear.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.923
There's no discount

04:13.628 --> 04:15.923
for direct butt-plopping.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.382
- What about--

04:15.964 --> 04:17.382
- Fine. $1.05.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.800
It's $1.05. You got it.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.468
Thanks.

04:18.842 --> 04:20.468
That's very nice of you.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.804
Hey.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.598
You raise something

04:22.846 --> 04:24.598
from $1 to $1.10.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.183
Is that such a big deal?

04:26.225 --> 04:29.895
Well, that's 10%, so percentage

04:26.225 --> 04:29.895
wise, it's not so tiny.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.646
Did I step

04:29.937 --> 04:31.646
into something here?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.023
You know, I shouldn't have

04:31.688 --> 04:33.023
gotten into a business

04:33.065 --> 04:34.816
that involves dealing

04:33.065 --> 04:34.816
with people.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.818
- Hey.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.818
- Hey, your cover!

04:36.860 --> 04:38.779
- I got an advance copy.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.779
- Wow! Oh, look at the inn.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.822
- It looks beautiful.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.822
- I know.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.365
I've got to get

04:40.864 --> 04:42.365
a new pair of pants.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.201
Okay, that didn't

04:42.407 --> 04:44.201
exactly follow.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.786
No, for the party

04:44.243 --> 04:45.786
they're gonna throw you.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.122
You don't need new pants.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.122
You just need pants.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.957
And the party's in New York,

04:48.163 --> 04:49.957
so you may not even need pants.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.000
- I've got to get a copy.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.000
- You got a connection.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.419
I want to get a bunch, though.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.419
Frame one or two of them.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.088
How's the article?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.088
What's it say?

04:56.130 --> 04:58.548
It was then, sadly, that I

04:56.130 --> 04:58.548
discovered Luke could not read.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.259
You know what I mean.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.262
'People are gonna think

05:00.300 --> 05:03.262
I wrote it. I mean, it's big.'

05:03.303 --> 05:04.972
- I nearly cried when I read it.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.972
- Good.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.640
And the fact that when

05:05.013 --> 05:06.640
Emily Gilmore reads it

05:06.681 --> 05:08.976
she's going to hire men to

05:06.681 --> 05:08.976
attack me with tire irons.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.102
Well, that's

05:09.017 --> 05:10.102
something else altogether.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.812
What did they put in?

05:11.853 --> 05:13.438
Not every heinous thing

05:11.853 --> 05:13.438
I said about her, but enough.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.149
I mean, it's good stuff.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.149
It's funny.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.817
Maybe if I told them

05:15.190 --> 05:16.817
not the face.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.693
- Who?

05:16.858 --> 05:18.693
- The guys with the tire irons.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.155
I think you should just show it

05:18.735 --> 05:21.155
to her and get it over with.

05:21.196 --> 05:25.325
Mmm, maybe.

05:21.196 --> 05:25.325
Yeah, you're probably right.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.452
Hello.

05:25.366 --> 05:27.452
Hold on.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.163
Hey, Luke, it's for you.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.163
It's Taylor.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.832
Caesar, you just broke

05:29.204 --> 05:31.832
Luke's standing.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.792
When Taylor calls I'm out

05:31.873 --> 05:33.792
even if he can see me

05:33.834 --> 05:35.335
through the stupid

05:33.834 --> 05:35.335
connecting window rule.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.171
I can tell him you're out

05:37.212 --> 05:38.755
'And that duke, your evil

05:37.212 --> 05:38.755
identical twin is in town.'

05:38.797 --> 05:40.381
No, no, I'll take it.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.550
I actually have to discuss

05:40.423 --> 05:42.550
something with him.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.262
- Hello.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.262
- Luke, hey, buddy.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.638
Hey, buddy.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.224
So, the powers-that-be

05:46.680 --> 05:49.224
have signed off

05:49.266 --> 05:51.059
on you purchasing

05:49.266 --> 05:51.059
the Twickum house.

05:51.101 --> 05:54.229
All that's left is dotting

05:51.101 --> 05:54.229
the I's and crossing the T's.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.315
Okay...fine.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.692
Ooh, sorry, Lorelai's there.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.692
Can't talk now, right?

05:58.733 --> 06:00.277
Pretty much.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.403
You know, I'm a bit

06:00.319 --> 06:02.403
of a romantic, Luke.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.947
The thought of you

06:02.445 --> 06:03.947
buying this house

06:03.989 --> 06:06.033
for your burgeoning family

06:03.989 --> 06:06.033
is quite touching .

06:06.074 --> 06:09.786
I almost tear up.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.786
Adds to the tax base, too.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.288
Well, good.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.288
Talk to you later.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.580
'Goodbye.'

06:12.622 --> 06:14.749
Wow, you and Taylor

06:12.622 --> 06:14.749
seem to be getting on

06:14.791 --> 06:16.210
very well these days.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.170
Yeah, well, he's been

06:16.251 --> 06:18.170
cooperating with me

06:18.212 --> 06:19.713
on certain matters.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.590
Luke, I think the sales tax

06:19.754 --> 06:22.590
is off by a penny.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.092
'In fact, I'm sure of it.'

06:24.134 --> 06:25.552
'I'm ready to go

06:24.134 --> 06:25.552
to the mat on this one.'

06:25.593 --> 06:27.386
Those guys

06:25.593 --> 06:27.386
with the tire irons?

06:27.428 --> 06:28.680
Where did your mother

06:27.428 --> 06:28.680
get them?

06:28.722 --> 06:32.559
The DAR and they don't work

06:28.722 --> 06:32.559
for outsiders.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.144
Show me the penny, Kirk.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.608
Hey, Al. Hey, Pete.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.608
Hey, Lance.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.527
- This goes to metro ASAP.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.527
- Okay.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.363
Rory, if you see Patel,

06:42.569 --> 06:44.363
tell him I'm looking for him.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.614
Got it.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.614
Need it back by 5:00, gentlemen.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.450
- Thanks, beautiful.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.450
- Manners, boys.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.493
Rory, you got

06:49.492 --> 06:50.493
those obituaries?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.828
Yeah, just give me five minutes.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.496
- Lot of dying today.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.496
- I hear that.

06:53.538 --> 06:54.664
Thank you.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.457
Oh, Patel,

06:54.706 --> 06:56.457
Charlie wants to see you.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.792
You going by Audrey?

06:56.499 --> 06:57.792
I can.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.670
Give her this.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.670
Okay, will do.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.421
- Hey, Ace.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.421
- Hey, you're early.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.049
Well, there's a first for

07:02.463 --> 07:04.049
everything. Where's the fire?

07:04.091 --> 07:06.467
Oh, just south of the 95.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.467
It's a four-alarm.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.095
We've got Kessler on it.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.888
- This is from Patel.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.888
- I'm not talking to him.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.098
I'll tell him.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.682
How did you know about the fire?

07:12.724 --> 07:14.935
I didn't. I meant, where are you

07:12.724 --> 07:14.935
going in such a hurry?

07:14.976 --> 07:17.645
Oh, I'm at half speed

07:14.976 --> 07:17.645
compared to this morning.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.022
- Oh, no.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.022
- What?

07:19.064 --> 07:20.523
I'm gone for

07:19.064 --> 07:20.523
five minutes

07:20.565 --> 07:22.150
and this place becomes

07:20.565 --> 07:22.150
a dumping ground.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.402
I'm loving the totally

07:22.192 --> 07:23.402
non-generic

07:23.443 --> 07:24.444
feel of your space here.

07:24.485 --> 07:26.113
I have customized it somewhat.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.614
- Eccentric uncle?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.614
- Brian Eno.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.657
- I was close. So let's go.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.657
- It's 4:30.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.034
So, cut out early.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.034
There's nothing going on here.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.286
We're doing

07:31.076 --> 07:32.286
our rough front page.

07:32.327 --> 07:33.578
We're picking our leads,

07:32.327 --> 07:33.578
our photos.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.414
It's our busiest part

07:33.620 --> 07:35.414
of the day.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.748
So, if the people of Stamford

07:35.455 --> 07:36.748
don't get their paper tomorrow

07:36.790 --> 07:37.999
they'll turn on the radio.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.126
- I can't go.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.126
- I know the boss.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.585
So do I.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.003
But I know how to work the boss.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.003
At least a little.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.380
'I know he's somewhere

07:42.045 --> 07:43.380
in the vicinity.'

07:43.422 --> 07:45.132
- Who, your dad?

07:43.422 --> 07:45.132
- Can't you sense it?

07:45.173 --> 07:46.549
The flurry of the frightened.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.549
The shuffle of sycophants.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.885
Hey, someone new.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.885
Have we been introduced?

07:48.927 --> 07:51.346
Jose Canseco, post-steroids,

07:48.927 --> 07:51.346
should be a warning to people.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.098
Are you keeping Rory

07:51.388 --> 07:53.098
from her work?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.350
- I was about to call security.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.350
- Does everyone know about the--

07:55.392 --> 07:57.852
Noon on Friday, main conference

07:55.392 --> 07:57.852
room, come with your game.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.896
Good. You call your mother

07:57.894 --> 07:59.896
about the vineyard?

07:59.938 --> 08:02.065
- She's on my list.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.065
- Push him on that, won't you?

08:02.107 --> 08:03.358
I'm going to four,

08:02.107 --> 08:03.358
if you want to catch up.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.818
- Okay.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.818
- 'See ya.'

08:04.859 --> 08:06.861
- Enjoy four. What's four?

08:04.859 --> 08:06.861
- Fourth floor.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.655
You news people and your jargon.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.991
- We have our own language.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.991
- So, he treating you alright?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.409
Who, your dad?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.409
He's been great.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.035
- Sure?

08:12.451 --> 08:14.035
- Yeah.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.163
Just checking. So, what do you

08:14.077 --> 08:16.163
think about Friday?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.664
An excellent alternative

08:16.204 --> 08:17.664
to Thursday.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.374
My sister's

08:17.705 --> 08:19.374
engagement party.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.793
Oh, right, I'm gonna try.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.793
I'm dying to see the yacht.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.462
Well, it's gonna be full

08:21.835 --> 08:23.462
of Honor's ditzy friends

08:23.503 --> 08:24.838
but the harbor's cool.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.256
Try and leave

08:24.879 --> 08:26.256
your grandparents' dinner early.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.966
They get you every Friday night.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.966
Let me have one.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.634
- You're very one-note today.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.634
- Well, I miss you, Ace.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.053
Well, I'll have more free time

08:29.676 --> 08:32.053
once finals are over

08:32.095 --> 08:34.431
and summer's here, unless I get

08:32.095 --> 08:34.431
that summer job here.

08:34.473 --> 08:36.641
You're probably a shoo-in.

08:34.473 --> 08:36.641
My father seems to like you.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.352
Oh, I hope so.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.352
I love it here.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.687
Okay, so I'll just go hang

08:38.393 --> 08:40.687
somewhere till you're done?

08:40.728 --> 08:42.689
I'll be done 6:30,

08:40.728 --> 08:42.689
7:00 at the latest.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.359
- Ace.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.359
- 6:45.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.444
So maybe I'll be hanging

08:45.400 --> 08:47.444
on two or five.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.070
- Is that the right terminology?

08:47.486 --> 08:49.070
- You're getting there.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.907
[upbeat music]

08:52.949 --> 08:53.950
(Lorelai)

08:52.949 --> 08:53.950
'Come on, please.'

08:53.992 --> 08:55.369
(Luke)

08:53.992 --> 08:55.369
'I'm done.'

08:55.410 --> 08:57.245
- 'No, you can't be done.'

08:55.410 --> 08:57.245
- 'I'm done.'

08:57.287 --> 08:58.955
(Lorelai)

08:57.287 --> 08:58.955
'There's more. I know it.

08:57.287 --> 08:58.955
It's germinating.'

08:58.997 --> 09:04.336
I'm done. I'm at peace.

08:58.997 --> 09:04.336
There's no more.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.171
Just the smell of Manhattan.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.964
I knew it. There was more.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.384
I mean, forget about the smells

09:08.006 --> 09:10.384
you can't identify.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.552
The ones you can identify

09:10.425 --> 09:12.552
are putrid.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.555
I mean, if it's not

09:12.593 --> 09:15.555
that rank smell of hot dog

09:15.596 --> 09:18.475
gushing out of those dirty

09:15.596 --> 09:18.475
sidewalk carts it's a..

09:18.517 --> 09:21.061
It's the stench of the subway

09:18.517 --> 09:21.061
pouring out of the dirty grates.

09:21.102 --> 09:24.314
I mean, the manhole-cover steam?

09:21.102 --> 09:24.314
God knows what that steam is.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.274
I mean, you can't get a breath

09:24.356 --> 09:26.274
of fresh air.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.775
Go, Luke.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.775
Rant, Luke.

09:27.817 --> 09:30.945
The whole city

09:27.817 --> 09:30.945
is a decaying heap.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.407
It's too many people crammed

09:30.987 --> 09:33.407
into too many buildings

09:33.448 --> 09:35.075
on too small

09:33.448 --> 09:35.075
a piece of land.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.077
It's an experiment

09:35.116 --> 09:37.077
that's failed.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.620
They should just give

09:37.118 --> 09:39.620
the whole island a push

09:39.662 --> 09:40.914
float it over to Europe.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.707
But after we see

09:40.955 --> 09:42.707
Spamalot, right?

09:42.749 --> 09:44.042
I paid a lot

09:42.749 --> 09:44.042
for those tickets.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.960
I'm fine with

09:44.084 --> 09:45.960
an urban environment.

09:46.002 --> 09:50.298
But you need land around you,

09:46.002 --> 09:50.298
space, air to breathe.

09:50.340 --> 09:53.093
[breathing heavily]

09:53.134 --> 09:56.596
- I'm done again.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.596
- I love ranting Luke.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.098
Why does this song

09:56.637 --> 09:58.098
keep playing?

09:58.139 --> 10:00.600
Because I put

09:58.139 --> 10:00.600
the CD player on repeat

10:00.641 --> 10:03.311
with my fancy remote

No, it's right they sent you

10:05.021 --> 10:07.107

16:02.002 --> 16:03.087
You are not getting that house.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.839
<i>Au contraire,</i> my friend.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.466
I happen to know that your

16:04.881 --> 16:06.466
credit's not exactly stellar.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.967
My credit?

16:08.008 --> 16:09.969
Granted, you've got some

16:08.008 --> 16:09.969
real estate holdings

16:10.010 --> 16:12.179
but your cash flow's been flat

16:10.010 --> 16:12.179
for three years.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.140
And unless you're willing

16:12.221 --> 16:14.140
to sell off assets

16:14.181 --> 16:16.601
you may be able to swing no more

16:14.181 --> 16:16.601
than a 5% down payment

16:16.643 --> 16:19.145
which makes you

16:16.643 --> 16:19.145
a real-estate risk.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.980
How do you know the state

16:19.186 --> 16:20.980
of my assets?

16:21.021 --> 16:22.649
That's the power

16:21.021 --> 16:22.649
of deep pockets, Luke.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.983
Put a sawbuck

16:22.690 --> 16:23.983
in the right hands

16:24.024 --> 16:25.860
and they babble

16:24.024 --> 16:25.860
like parrots.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.447
Well, I am one of Stars Hollow

16:25.902 --> 16:29.447
bank's oldest customers.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.074
I'm not anticipating

16:29.489 --> 16:32.074
any problems.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.327
Well, I'm Stars Hollow bank's

16:32.116 --> 16:34.327
biggest customer.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.829
- I think that means more.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.829
- I don't believe this.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.413
You're swimming in cash

16:37.455 --> 16:40.166
and you fought me over

16:37.455 --> 16:40.166
a 10-cent raise on toast.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.084
And you folded

16:40.207 --> 16:42.084
like a road map.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.337
It might explain the discrepancy

16:42.126 --> 16:44.337
in our net worths.

16:44.378 --> 16:47.632
So I think I will have

16:44.378 --> 16:47.632
those donuts to go.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.968
You've got change

16:47.674 --> 16:49.968
for a $100, right?

16:54.263 --> 16:56.641
<i>Das</i> is good, ya?

16:56.683 --> 16:59.018
- I wanna talk to town elders.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.018
- The town elders?

16:59.059 --> 17:00.311
You keep talking

16:59.059 --> 17:00.311
about the powers-that-be.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.271
- That's the town elders, right?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.271
- Yes.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.273
They oversee the town assets,

17:02.313 --> 17:04.273
the real estate.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.108
- I want to see them.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.108
- They won't go for that, Luke.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.568
- Why?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.568
- It isn't how it's done.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.153
They don't deal

17:07.610 --> 17:09.153
with the public.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.947
They're the final arbiters.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.947
What they say goes.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.156
I'm seein' 'em.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.574
- But..

17:12.198 --> 17:13.574
- Arrange it.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.328
[instrumental music]

17:19.622 --> 17:20.999
- You breathing, honey?

17:19.622 --> 17:20.999
- I'm breathing.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.250
Hey, was that Andy Dick

17:21.040 --> 17:23.250
out in the hallway?

17:23.292 --> 17:25.252
No, honey.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.252
This happened last time.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.006
You go into labor, you start

17:25.294 --> 17:28.006
thinking you see famous people.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.174
Right, suddenly my midwife

17:28.047 --> 17:30.174
was Wolf Blitzer.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.092
Hey, you need me

17:30.216 --> 17:32.092
to unpack you?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.511
You probably

17:32.134 --> 17:33.511
don't have to.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.638
We have everything she needs

17:33.553 --> 17:35.638
all set up.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.140
We guys always pack

17:35.680 --> 17:38.140
a suitcase, useless.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.226
So, you been thinking

17:38.182 --> 17:40.226
about names?

17:40.267 --> 17:41.811
I'm leaning towards

17:40.267 --> 17:41.811
Ethan, for a boy

17:41.853 --> 17:43.521
or Glenda if it's a girl.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.773
Although I like Martha too

17:43.563 --> 17:45.773
and Rupert for a boy.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.608
They're all good, sweetie.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.028
Hey, whatever we don't use, we

17:47.650 --> 17:50.028
save for the next one, right?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.529
Right, right.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.529
The next one.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.864
Hey, will you stay with her?

17:52.906 --> 17:54.198
I got to call

17:52.906 --> 17:54.198
my mulch delivery guys

17:54.240 --> 17:55.491
and let them know

17:54.240 --> 17:55.491
what's happening.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.827
Yup, I'll be here.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.827
You comfortable?

17:57.869 --> 17:59.412
I am, Penelope Cruz.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.205
[laughs]

18:01.247 --> 18:02.289
- Really?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.289
- What?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.541
You're eating an apple?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.125
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.125
I'll put it away.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.336
No, eat. I'm just surprised.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.336
It's not your thing.

18:07.378 --> 18:09.171
I know, we were by a vending

18:07.378 --> 18:09.171
machine checking you in

18:09.213 --> 18:10.882
it was there

18:09.213 --> 18:10.882
and it looked good.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.676
It does look good.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.676
It looks like Ben Stiller!

18:13.718 --> 18:15.970
Hmm.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.890
Um, hey, Sookie,

18:16.012 --> 18:18.890
um, when did you know for sure?

18:18.932 --> 18:20.224
About what?

18:20.266 --> 18:21.935
'That you were pregnant,

18:20.266 --> 18:21.935
how could you tell?'

18:21.976 --> 18:24.270
Don't you remember?

18:21.976 --> 18:24.270
Norman Mailer.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.479
Right, right,

18:24.311 --> 18:25.479
Norman Mailer.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.189
'I wonder how Norman is.'

18:27.231 --> 18:28.983
I had a dream about him

18:27.231 --> 18:28.983
the other night.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.985
He was yelling at someone

18:29.025 --> 18:30.985
to shut up and read Joyce.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.362
But how soon was

18:31.027 --> 18:33.362
the Norman Mailer moment

18:33.404 --> 18:35.364
after you and Jackson

18:33.404 --> 18:35.364
conceived?

18:35.406 --> 18:39.452
Wow, uh, well, I don't know.

18:35.406 --> 18:39.452
A few weeks.

18:39.493 --> 18:41.829
- It was weeks?

18:39.493 --> 18:41.829
- I think.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.040
And you didn't know before?

18:41.871 --> 18:44.040
Not a feeling or anything?

18:44.082 --> 18:46.084
I don't know. You've had one

18:44.082 --> 18:46.084
before. Don't you remember?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.752
Yeah, it's been a while.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.796
- Why are you asking?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.796
- Oh, I don't know.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.130
Just being in a maternity ward

18:51.171 --> 18:53.132
makes me wonder about

18:51.171 --> 18:53.132
these things.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.926
I'm going to see

18:53.173 --> 18:54.926
how far along she is.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.719
- We'll be a couple minutes.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.719
- Oh, sure.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.012
She looks like Marlo Thomas.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.056
- See, it's not just me.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.056
- I'll be outside.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.649
- Ooh, excuse me, doctor.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.649
- Yes?

19:09.690 --> 19:11.191
Hi, you're not off to save

19:09.690 --> 19:11.191
a life, are you?

19:11.233 --> 19:12.234
Not at the moment.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.028
Okay, just quick question.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.447
Pregnancy tests,

19:14.070 --> 19:16.447
what's the deal with them now?

19:16.489 --> 19:18.074
I haven't taken one

19:16.489 --> 19:18.074
in a couple of decades

19:18.116 --> 19:20.326
and I was just wondering

19:18.116 --> 19:20.326
if they work any differently.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.745
They're more accurate now,

19:20.367 --> 19:22.745
but the process is similar.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.998
Okay, so let's say you do it,

19:22.787 --> 19:24.998
have sex, you know.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.458
How soon after

19:25.039 --> 19:27.458
can a test tell you anything?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.251
- At least two weeks.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.251
- Not two days?

19:29.293 --> 19:31.587
It won't be definitive

19:29.293 --> 19:31.587
after just two days.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.923
Boy, the sword of Damocles

19:31.629 --> 19:33.923
is really hovering over you

19:33.965 --> 19:35.215
for a couple weeks

19:33.965 --> 19:35.215
there, huh?

19:35.257 --> 19:36.383
Pretty much.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.510
Home tests can be tricky too.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.845
Can't buy one

19:37.551 --> 19:38.845
where I live

19:38.886 --> 19:40.513
because people

19:38.886 --> 19:40.513
would see and talk.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.931
It's a<i> small town.</i>

19:41.973 --> 19:43.516
And even afterward

19:43.557 --> 19:46.310
the garbage man could see

19:43.557 --> 19:46.310
the box in the trash and blab

19:46.352 --> 19:48.187
and you know,

19:46.352 --> 19:48.187
I like my garbage man

19:48.228 --> 19:49.981
but again, it's a small town,

19:48.228 --> 19:49.981
it's not your problem.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.816
- So there's no machine?

19:50.023 --> 19:51.816
- Machine?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.943
Yeah, a machine

19:51.858 --> 19:53.943
you could stick me in.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.653
You know, you're putting

19:53.985 --> 19:55.653
pig vessels in people.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.530
Isn't there a machine

19:55.695 --> 19:57.530
that could tell me right away

19:57.571 --> 19:59.406
away from the prying eyes

19:57.571 --> 19:59.406
of the garbage man?

19:59.448 --> 20:01.450
You really need to wait and take

19:59.448 --> 20:01.450
the test at the proper time.

20:01.492 --> 20:03.410
Okay, see,

20:01.492 --> 20:03.410
I'm eating an apple.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.080
Normally, this would not be a

20:03.452 --> 20:06.080
sign of anything except hunger

20:06.122 --> 20:07.748
except I don't eat

20:06.122 --> 20:07.748
much fruit.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.542
I know I should, but I don't

20:07.790 --> 20:09.542
have a hankering for it.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.545
I had it when I was pregnant

20:09.583 --> 20:12.545
with my first kid, though.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.463
Kept craving those apples

20:14.505 --> 20:16.549
and this morning, boy,

20:14.505 --> 20:16.549
was I craving an apple.

20:16.590 --> 20:17.842
Well, that could be a sign.

20:17.884 --> 20:18.968
- It could?

20:17.884 --> 20:18.968
- Or not.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.302
[sighs]

20:20.344 --> 20:22.138
Okay, you're nice,

20:20.344 --> 20:22.138
you're sweet

20:22.180 --> 20:23.973
and I've taken up too much

20:22.180 --> 20:23.973
of your time.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.392
- Thank you.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.392
- No problem.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.187
[cellphone rings]

20:32.148 --> 20:33.232
Hello.

20:33.273 --> 20:34.274
Lorelai, it's your mother.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.693
I just have a quick question.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.486
- 'Okay.'

20:35.735 --> 20:37.486
- Well, I got my ballerina.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.030
Oh, which one?

20:37.528 --> 20:39.030
Sashanka?

20:39.072 --> 20:40.573
No, I waited too long

20:40.614 --> 20:42.742
and Mitsie Hertferdshire

20:40.614 --> 20:42.742
scooped her up.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.786
It's okay because Sashanka

20:42.783 --> 20:45.786
tore a ligament last year

20:45.828 --> 20:47.371
and is probably washed up.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.665
- I got Pola.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.665
- Oh, Pola.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.876
Blond hair,

20:49.707 --> 20:51.876
bullet body, so petite

20:51.918 --> 20:52.960
but thighs that could

20:51.918 --> 20:52.960

20:53.002 --> 20:54.253
Sounds good.

20:55.713 --> 20:57.381
it's been so much fun.'

20:57.423 --> 20:59.383
She speaks this charming

20:57.423 --> 20:59.383
broken English

20:59.425 --> 21:01.219
and everything is so new

20:59.425 --> 21:01.219
and fresh to her.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.137
I'm glad.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.137
So, what's up?

21:08.184 --> 21:10.561
of yours, the magic 8 ball.'

21:10.603 --> 21:11.812
I can't believe

21:10.603 --> 21:11.812
that's still there.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.940
And she is mesmerized by it.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.983
She's been playing with it

21:13.981 --> 21:15.983
ever since, asking it questions.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.610
She won't put it down

21:17.651 --> 21:19.695
and I was just wondering

21:17.651 --> 21:19.695
if I can let her keep it.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.072
Oh, sure.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.322
'It's practically

21:21.114 --> 21:22.322
glued to her hand.'

21:22.364 --> 21:24.033
Whatever Pola wants,

21:22.364 --> 21:24.033
Pola gets.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.952
Good. Thank you.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.746
It is yes!

21:25.993 --> 21:28.746
Yes, I'm gonna be rich!

21:28.788 --> 21:31.249
I just want to hug

21:28.788 --> 21:31.249
the stuffing out of her.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.917
You'll meet her tomorrow night

21:31.290 --> 21:32.917
at dinner.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.461
- I'm looking forward to it.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.461
- Bye and thanks again.

21:35.502 --> 21:37.588
Bye, mom.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.048
[sighs]

21:41.050 --> 21:43.552
[cellphone rings]

21:43.594 --> 21:45.221
Hey, how's it going?

21:45.263 --> 21:46.722
Oh, fine.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.722
She's all checked in.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.474
Breathing normally,

21:46.764 --> 21:48.474
contracting painfully.

21:48.515 --> 21:49.892
The cursing should start

21:48.515 --> 21:49.892
any time now.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.310
Everything as it should be.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.229
Good. I mean,

21:51.351 --> 21:53.229
that was weird, wasn't it?

21:53.271 --> 21:55.355
She was like, what,

21:53.271 --> 21:55.355
a week and a half early?

21:55.397 --> 21:57.483
Yeah, those little buggers tend

21:55.397 --> 21:57.483
to come when they want to come.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.944
I can't get "coming around

21:57.524 --> 21:59.944
the mountain" out of my mind.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.362
It's like, one of those phrases

21:59.986 --> 22:02.362
like "drop it like it's hot"

22:02.404 --> 22:03.906
that I really wish

22:02.404 --> 22:03.906
I'd never heard.

22:03.948 --> 22:06.909
Hey, um,

22:03.948 --> 22:06.909
you're doing everything

22:06.951 --> 22:08.661
you need to do

22:06.951 --> 22:08.661
in that area, right?

22:08.702 --> 22:10.370
- 'What area?'

22:08.702 --> 22:10.370
- Um, protection.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.790
To prevent something from

22:10.412 --> 22:12.790
coming around the mountain?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.333
- I hope so.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.333
- Hope?

22:14.374 --> 22:16.210
This is not an area

22:14.374 --> 22:16.210
where hope is good enough.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.587
I think I have it covered

22:16.252 --> 22:18.587
and that wasn't a euphemism.

22:18.629 --> 22:20.714
Okay, "think" is not

22:18.629 --> 22:20.714
good enough either.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.424
What kind of birth control

22:20.756 --> 22:22.424
do you use?

22:22.466 --> 22:25.343
Um, I'm in

22:22.466 --> 22:25.343
the dining hall.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.804
That was not my question.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.514
People are like three feet

22:26.846 --> 22:28.514
away from me.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.141
Listen, all I'm saying is

22:30.183 --> 22:32.226
you cannot leave it up

22:30.183 --> 22:32.226
to the guy, okay?

22:32.268 --> 22:33.269
They are not reliable.

22:33.311 --> 22:34.854
I don't leave it

22:33.311 --> 22:34.854
up to the guy.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.689
They get into this state,

22:34.895 --> 22:36.689
you know? Primordial.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.858
It's all exciting, but so is

22:36.730 --> 22:38.858
eating a gallon of pudding

22:38.899 --> 22:40.776
and believe me, you're going to

22:38.899 --> 22:40.776
regret that later.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.028
'I use that as an example

22:40.818 --> 22:42.028
because I know'

22:42.069 --> 22:43.445
you like pudding.'

You've got to figure,

22:43.487 --> 22:45.531
if he shoots, he scores.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.116
I mean, look around you,

22:45.572 --> 22:47.116
there are babies popping out

22:47.158 --> 22:48.284
all over the place.

22:48.326 --> 22:49.576
You're in a maternity ward.

22:49.618 --> 22:50.953
You've got

22:49.618 --> 22:50.953
a skewed sample there.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.579
So you caught up

22:50.995 --> 22:52.579
on the subject?

22:52.621 --> 22:54.498
You've caught me up,

22:52.621 --> 22:54.498
society's caught me up

22:54.540 --> 22:56.416
the health channel on cable's

22:54.540 --> 22:56.416
caught me up

22:56.458 --> 22:58.294
Miss Driscoll,

22:56.458 --> 22:58.294
the sad spinster, gym teacher

22:58.336 --> 23:00.213
at Stars Hollow high

22:58.336 --> 23:00.213
caught me up.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.380
Miss Driscoll, right, like she

23:00.254 --> 23:02.380
would ever need birth control.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.717
- 'I'm caught up, honest.'

23:02.422 --> 23:04.717
- Okay, good.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.635
Mom, what's going on

23:04.758 --> 23:06.635
with you?

23:06.677 --> 23:08.346
- 'Nothing.'

23:06.677 --> 23:08.346
- Mom?

23:08.386 --> 23:10.388
I might be pregnant.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.725
Oh.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.518
[exhales sharply]

23:14.560 --> 23:16.478
So<i> that's</i> where this

23:14.560 --> 23:16.478
is coming from.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.438
I blame mom, she never

23:16.520 --> 23:18.438
sat me down for the talk.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.358
And Miss Driscoll,

23:18.480 --> 23:20.358
she had her chance, too.

23:20.398 --> 23:22.360
All those PTA meetings and all

23:20.398 --> 23:22.360
she ever talked about was golf.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.321
How did this happen?

23:22.400 --> 23:25.321
I mean, if it's true.

23:25.363 --> 23:28.032
Luke and I came home from the

23:25.363 --> 23:28.032
magazine party the other night.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.951
We were a little loopy,

23:28.074 --> 23:30.951
and it got...primordial.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.328
'All roadblocks down.'

23:32.370 --> 23:34.288
'I mean,

23:32.370 --> 23:34.288
I am always beyond careful.'

23:34.330 --> 23:36.290
The last time I had

23:34.330 --> 23:36.290
my roadblocks down was

23:36.332 --> 23:38.000
I don't know,

23:36.332 --> 23:38.000
count how old you are to the day

23:38.042 --> 23:39.043
and add nine months.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.544
But that doesn't mean--

23:40.586 --> 23:42.296
- I just ate an apple.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.296
- Uh-oh.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.672
- 'Yeah and I liked it.'

23:42.338 --> 23:43.672
- Whoa!

23:43.714 --> 23:45.465
My body is telling me

23:43.714 --> 23:45.465
something.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.385
Maybe it's not telling you

23:45.507 --> 23:47.385
what you think it is.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.387
Maybe it's just telling you

23:47.425 --> 23:49.387
to better comply

23:49.427 --> 23:50.596
with the government's

23:49.427 --> 23:50.596
recommendations

23:50.637 --> 23:52.139
for food and vegetable

23:50.637 --> 23:52.139
intake.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.182
That's not just propaganda,

23:52.181 --> 23:53.182
you know.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.225
- Maybe.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.225
- And..

23:54.267 --> 23:55.517
- What?

23:54.267 --> 23:55.517
- 'Well.'

23:55.559 --> 23:58.354
Would it be so horrible?

23:55.559 --> 23:58.354
I mean, it's Luke.

23:58.396 --> 24:01.274
- It<i> is</i> Luke?

23:58.396 --> 24:01.274
- Yes, it's Luke.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.858
Well, you guys

24:01.315 --> 24:02.858
are so close

24:02.900 --> 24:04.442
it could be headed

24:02.900 --> 24:04.442
somewhere.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.529
I know, but not right now, hon.

24:04.484 --> 24:07.529
It's early for us.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.489
You know, I mean, my life is

24:07.571 --> 24:09.489
going really good.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.450
It's the inn and this

new potential opportunity

24:12.492 --> 24:15.037
and...you know,

24:12.492 --> 24:15.037
I just got rid of you.

24:15.079 --> 24:16.663
It's the first time

24:15.079 --> 24:16.663
in my life

24:16.705 --> 24:19.417
I've gotten to feel like

24:16.705 --> 24:19.417
a single, grown-up woman.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.668
Now is just not

24:19.457 --> 24:21.668
the right time.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.255
Okay, well,

24:21.710 --> 24:24.255
maybe it's not true.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.756
Yeah, maybe.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.507
But what are you going to do

24:25.798 --> 24:27.507
if it is?

24:27.549 --> 24:31.095
I could really use

24:27.549 --> 24:31.095
my magic 8 ball about now.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.305
I'm gonna let you go, hon.

24:32.346 --> 24:35.349
- Keep me posted.

24:32.346 --> 24:35.349
- Okay, bye.

24:41.397 --> 24:42.398
[sighs]

24:46.152 --> 24:47.903
- I'm early?

24:46.152 --> 24:47.903
- A little.

24:47.945 --> 24:49.447
It's not 10 after 12:00.

24:49.487 --> 24:51.157
Oh, your watch must be fast.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.118
My wife probably set it ahead

24:51.198 --> 24:54.118
to get me home earlier.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.744
Never works.

24:55.786 --> 24:56.954
It's 11:49.

24:59.248 --> 25:01.459
- Charmless, isn't it?

24:59.248 --> 25:01.459
- The room?

25:01.499 --> 25:03.627
- Needs plants.

25:01.499 --> 25:03.627
- I can get plants.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.629
Ever been to the

25:03.669 --> 25:05.629
<i>tribune</i> offices, Chicago?

25:05.671 --> 25:07.047
- No.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.047
- A cathedral.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.715
- Go, if you ever get chance.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.715
- I will.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.092
[cellphone rings]

25:10.134 --> 25:11.551
Gonna get that?

25:11.593 --> 25:13.346
I'm not done here.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.222
You got 10 minutes.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.975
I'm gonna stay here,

25:15.264 --> 25:17.975
catch up on e-mails

25:18.017 --> 25:20.686
make everyone uncomfortable

25:18.017 --> 25:20.686
that I beat them here.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.229
That sounds good.

[cellphone beeps]

25:23.314 --> 25:24.690
Hey, you.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.025
It's a girl.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.319
A girl!

25:26.066 --> 25:28.319
Oh, good, we need a girl.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.154
- Why do we need a girl?

25:28.361 --> 25:30.154
- I don't know.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.239
Aren't there enough guys

25:30.196 --> 25:32.239
walking around out there?

25:32.281 --> 25:34.408
Well, it's a beautiful girl,

25:32.281 --> 25:34.408
name to come

25:34.450 --> 25:36.827
and Sookie's fine,

25:34.450 --> 25:36.827
Jackson's fine, everyone's fine.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.745
14 hours of labor

25:36.869 --> 25:38.745
was the downside

25:38.787 --> 25:40.622
but Sookie has the rest

25:38.787 --> 25:40.622
of her little girl's life

25:40.664 --> 25:41.999
to get back at her for that.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.625
I love the circle

25:42.041 --> 25:43.625
of life.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.127
- And there's more good news.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.127
- What?

25:45.169 --> 25:47.087
It was a false alarm.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.087
I'm not pregnant.

25:47.129 --> 25:48.630
The crisis has passed.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.300
Oh, mom, good.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.300
I'm glad.

25:51.342 --> 25:53.010
You're glad?

25:53.052 --> 25:55.054
The sight of babies isn't

25:53.052 --> 25:55.054
freaking me out anymore.

25:55.095 --> 25:56.096
I can enjoy

25:55.095 --> 25:56.096
the maternity ward again.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.015
So what was

25:56.138 --> 25:58.015
with the apple?

25:58.057 --> 26:00.059
I don't know, but I just had

25:58.057 --> 26:00.059
a moon pie and a ding dong

26:00.100 --> 26:02.311
and washed it down with an

26:00.100 --> 26:02.311
orange crush in the cafeteria.

26:02.353 --> 26:04.021
So, no desire

26:02.353 --> 26:04.021
for anything nutritional.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.772
Thank, god.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.772
Oh, I'm glad, mom.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.525
Yeah.

26:07.565 --> 26:10.069
So, listen, how about we

26:07.565 --> 26:10.069
reschedule Sookie's baby shower?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.445
How?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.445
It's too late.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.113
No, we'll throw

26:13.155 --> 26:14.698
a "welcome to the earth,

26:13.155 --> 26:14.698
baby girl Belleville" party.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.574
- Did you save the decorations?

26:14.740 --> 26:16.574
- Still in my car.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.702
How about Saturday morning?

26:16.616 --> 26:18.702
That's when she gets home.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.080
Come back with me after dinner.

26:18.744 --> 26:21.080
We'll set it up at her house.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.580
Sounds good.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.708
Hey, um..

26:24.750 --> 26:27.294
...did you ever mention

26:24.750 --> 26:27.294
this pregnancy scare to Luke?

26:27.336 --> 26:28.879
Oh, my God, no.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.879
Can you imagine?

26:28.921 --> 26:30.506
"Luke, you're gonna be a daddy."

26:30.548 --> 26:32.258
Suddenly, there's nothing left

26:30.548 --> 26:32.258
but a puff of smoke

26:32.299 --> 26:33.884
and a baseball cap

26:32.299 --> 26:33.884
spinning on the floor.

26:33.926 --> 26:37.012
Yeah, he never seemed much

26:33.926 --> 26:37.012
like a family guy.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.889
This is for the best.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.100
Listen,

26:38.931 --> 26:41.100
I've got to get back.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.893
We have a big staff meeting

26:41.141 --> 26:42.893
in a few minutes now

26:42.935 --> 26:44.937
and I want to make sure

26:42.935 --> 26:44.937
everything's set up and ready.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.939
Well, I'll see you tonight,

26:44.978 --> 26:46.939
my one and only offspring.

26:46.980 --> 26:50.150
- Bye.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.278
[cellphone beeps]

26:52.319 --> 26:54.821
- Congratulations.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.821
- Thanks.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.198
She's sound asleep.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.492
I'm not so bright-eyed myself.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.618
Hey, before you go to sleep,

26:58.534 --> 27:00.618
we should decide on a name.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.205
I know.

27:00.660 --> 27:03.205
Names are so hard.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.290
But the good thing,

27:03.247 --> 27:04.290
whatever name we don't use now

27:04.331 --> 27:05.791
we just use

27:04.331 --> 27:05.791
on the next one.

27:05.832 --> 27:07.334
Yeah, you know,

27:05.832 --> 27:07.334
we need to talk about that.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.961
Sure.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.337
I probably should have brought

27:09.002 --> 27:10.337
it up sooner, sorry.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.755
No problem.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.755
What?

27:11.797 --> 27:15.217
- You're gonna get vasectomy.

27:11.797 --> 27:15.217
- What?

27:15.259 --> 27:17.511
You're getting

27:15.259 --> 27:17.511
a vasectomy.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.221
You got me.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.432
You're funny.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.432
Dark, but funny.

27:21.474 --> 27:23.517
I'm not joking, sweetie.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.269
We're cutting that tube,

27:23.559 --> 27:25.269
if it is a tube.

27:25.311 --> 27:27.020
I'm not really up

27:25.311 --> 27:27.020
on the procedure.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.023
The doctor doing it will be,

27:27.062 --> 27:30.023
though, so, sure he'll know.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.108
- You're not kidding.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.108
- I'm not kidding.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.859
Sookie, come on.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.028
Jackson, we have one of each.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.028
We kept the species going.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.323
- But I wanted four.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.323
- And I wanted three.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.199
- This is a good compromise.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.199
- I'm sorry.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.285
Two is not a compromise

27:39.241 --> 27:41.285
between three and four.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.828
This is Reggie.

27:42.869 --> 27:44.330
He's going to take you down

27:42.869 --> 27:44.330
and have it done.

27:44.371 --> 27:46.373
- I'm having it done today?

27:44.371 --> 27:46.373
- Yep.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.917
- They sent the big nurse.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.917
- Just in case.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.085
Hey!

27:50.127 --> 27:51.587
You get her back

27:50.127 --> 27:51.587
afterwards.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.339
Now, it's just a quick

27:51.629 --> 27:53.339
outpatient procedure.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.840
You go in, lie down,

27:53.380 --> 27:54.840
close your eyes

27:54.881 --> 27:56.133
snip, snip,

27:54.881 --> 27:56.133
and you're shooting blanks.

27:56.175 --> 27:57.635
Is this all

27:56.175 --> 27:57.635
I'm having done today

27:57.675 --> 27:59.094
or do I need to get some

27:57.675 --> 27:59.094
glute implants or something?

27:59.136 --> 28:01.263
It's everything, I promise.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.764
Kiss before you go.

28:02.806 --> 28:05.601
Hey, I just thought

28:02.806 --> 28:05.601
of the perfect name.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.894
First name, Martha.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.894
Middle name..

28:07.936 --> 28:10.897
Janice Laurie Ethan Rupert

28:07.936 --> 28:10.897
Glenda Carson Daisy Danny.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.650
You got them all in.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.692
Now go get cut.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.112
[sighs]

28:18.656 --> 28:21.950
Oh...hi.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.410
[doorbell rings]

28:23.452 --> 28:24.870
Hi, mom.

28:24.911 --> 28:26.205
Lorelai, come in, come in.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.623
I want you to meet

28:26.246 --> 28:27.623
my special guest.

28:27.665 --> 28:30.543
I'm curious to meet her.

28:30.584 --> 28:32.002
Oh, boy.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.962
She sure looked different

28:32.044 --> 28:33.962
in her picture.

28:34.004 --> 28:38.091
This is Mikhail.

28:34.004 --> 28:38.091
Mikhail, my daughter, Lorelai.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.301
- Hi.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.301
- Hello.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.927
What happened to Pola?

28:40.969 --> 28:43.096
Oh, that annoying little stick.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.096
She drove me crazy.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.557
Hmm, you loved her.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.600
There was something wrong

28:44.598 --> 28:46.600
with her so flighty, so skinny.

28:46.642 --> 28:48.060
'She made no noise

28:46.642 --> 28:48.060
when she walked'

28:48.101 --> 28:49.395
'so you couldn't

28:48.101 --> 28:49.395
hear her coming.'

28:49.436 --> 28:51.897
'I felt like I was being stalked

28:49.436 --> 28:51.897
by an elf.'

28:51.938 --> 28:53.732
She had a mentality

28:51.938 --> 28:53.732
of a preschooler.

28:53.773 --> 28:54.983
If she was sitting

28:53.773 --> 28:54.983
when she laughed

28:55.025 --> 28:56.360
she would clap her

28:55.025 --> 28:56.360
feet together.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.070
- Smoked like a fiend, too.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.070
- Uh-huh.

28:58.111 --> 29:01.198
She kept playing with that

28:58.111 --> 29:01.198
obnoxious magic 8 ball of yours.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.033
She'd ask it the same question

29:01.240 --> 29:03.033
over and over

29:03.075 --> 29:04.493
till she got the answer

29:03.075 --> 29:04.493
she wanted.

29:04.535 --> 29:06.328
I told her

29:04.535 --> 29:06.328
that's not how it works.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.664
You're supposed to accept

29:06.370 --> 29:08.664
the first answer it gives you

29:08.706 --> 29:10.457
and that's that,

29:08.706 --> 29:10.457
but, no, she kept going.

29:10.499 --> 29:13.126
I wanted to stick the little

29:10.499 --> 29:13.126
twig in the garbage disposal.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.420
So I exchanged her

29:13.168 --> 29:14.420
for Mikhail.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.713
Really, you can do that?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.464
just trade her in

29:15.754 --> 29:17.464
for another human being?

29:17.506 --> 29:19.299
I paid for her, Lorelai

29:17.506 --> 29:19.299
and she wasn't what I wanted.

29:19.341 --> 29:20.551
All right.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.927
Isn't he stunning?

29:21.968 --> 29:23.470
Hmm, he's easy

29:21.968 --> 29:23.470
on the eyes, yes.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.013
You should see him stretch.

29:25.055 --> 29:26.765
Do you want Luminista

29:25.055 --> 29:26.765
to take your bag?

29:26.806 --> 29:28.392
No, I'm gonna keep this with me.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.935
There's something

29:28.434 --> 29:29.935
I want to show you.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.520
Oh, good.

29:29.976 --> 29:31.520
Shall we go in the living room?

29:31.562 --> 29:34.189
He's learning English

29:31.562 --> 29:34.189
so keep your words short.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.941
Living room.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.568
Yes, please.

29:37.610 --> 29:38.818
What a value.

29:42.989 --> 29:45.200
How interested are Stamford

29:42.989 --> 29:45.200
residents in arts coverage

29:45.242 --> 29:46.243
of a city 40 miles away?

29:46.285 --> 29:48.078
They're interested.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.122
That just takes resources away

29:48.120 --> 29:50.122
from covering local events--

29:50.163 --> 29:52.165
'That are less interesting

29:50.163 --> 29:52.165
than events taking place'

29:52.207 --> 29:53.292
'in New York city.'

29:53.333 --> 29:55.001
If they're

29:53.333 --> 29:55.001
that interesting

29:55.043 --> 29:56.712
we should send a couple

29:55.043 --> 29:56.712
of our own calendar staffers.

29:56.754 --> 29:58.505
Freelancers are

29:56.754 --> 29:58.505
a pain in the butt.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.382
So, Franz Ferdinand

29:58.547 --> 30:00.382
comes to New York

30:00.424 --> 30:02.134
forget freelancers,

30:00.424 --> 30:02.134
you'll go cover it?

30:02.175 --> 30:03.302
I didn't say that,

30:02.175 --> 30:03.302
and who's he?

30:03.343 --> 30:04.595
[laughter]

30:04.637 --> 30:06.764
- He's a band.

30:04.637 --> 30:06.764
- Watch it, Fisher.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.890
- Even I knew that, Sam.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.890
- Mitchum, please, arbitrate.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.934
'And spoil the fun?

30:08.932 --> 30:10.934
No way.'

30:10.976 --> 30:12.728
- It's your money.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.728
- Money well spent.

30:12.770 --> 30:14.187
It's not your money,

30:12.770 --> 30:14.187
Lucille.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.855
Look, keep the system as is.

30:15.897 --> 30:18.233
We don't even have office space

30:15.897 --> 30:18.233
for extra people

30:18.275 --> 30:19.652
let alone the budget.

30:19.693 --> 30:22.028
Go to universities,

30:19.693 --> 30:22.028
Yale, wherever

30:22.070 --> 30:24.990
get volunteers to pick up

30:22.070 --> 30:24.990
what our staff can't cover.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.617
- Those kids jump at the chance.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.617
- I'll pick up some slack.

30:26.659 --> 30:27.826
After you pick up

30:26.659 --> 30:27.826
my dry cleaning, right?

30:27.867 --> 30:29.328
I'll pick that up that too.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.288
Good, Harry, don't let him

30:29.369 --> 30:31.288
push you around.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.624
Are we gonna end this marathon

30:31.330 --> 30:33.624
before we get to subscriptions?

30:33.666 --> 30:34.916
Please say no.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.835
Charlie's feeling

30:34.958 --> 30:36.835
neglected again.

30:36.876 --> 30:38.629
Where are we with our

30:36.876 --> 30:38.629
sales department, Charlie?

30:38.671 --> 30:40.756
Abundant turnover.

30:38.671 --> 30:40.756
We have to start paying more.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.633
That got the boss

30:40.798 --> 30:42.633
where it hurts.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.218
It's minimum wage

30:42.675 --> 30:45.218
plus 20% commission?

30:45.260 --> 30:47.137
And all the stale pastry

30:45.260 --> 30:47.137
they can eat.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.515
- Up it to 30%.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.515
- Okay, now I'm in pain.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.517
Crunch the numbers, Lloyd,

30:49.556 --> 30:51.517
and get them to me.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.393
I never go behind the back

30:51.558 --> 30:53.393
of captain crunch.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.061
Let's get together Monday.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.564
Let's all resume this Monday.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.564
Go home.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.150
Meet your kids.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.150
Feed your dogs.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.235
Have a good one.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.571
Good night.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.156
That was fun.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.450
Yeah, that's the way

31:06.198 --> 31:08.450
those things should go

31:08.492 --> 31:09.868
give and take.

31:09.909 --> 31:11.161
The less I say, the better.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.538
Can I get you anything?

31:12.579 --> 31:13.622
No, I'm about

31:12.579 --> 31:13.622
to take off here.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.123
Okay.

31:15.165 --> 31:17.710
So, I'm going to be

31:15.165 --> 31:17.710
pulling back here soon.

31:17.751 --> 31:18.794
From the paper?

31:18.836 --> 31:20.629
I've done my damage.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.798
It's time for them to take it

31:20.671 --> 31:22.798
and make something of it.

31:22.840 --> 31:24.257
Oh, okay.

31:24.299 --> 31:27.010
I'll probably be in Monday,

31:24.299 --> 31:27.010
maybe Tuesday

31:27.052 --> 31:29.179
then not so much

31:27.052 --> 31:29.179
after that.

31:29.221 --> 31:32.725
Well, I'm happy to keep going,

31:29.221 --> 31:32.725
even without you here.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.976
You know, you and I haven't

31:32.766 --> 31:34.976
really sat down

31:35.018 --> 31:37.771
and talked about the situation,

31:35.018 --> 31:37.771
about how you're doing here.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.482
- Well, you've been busy.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.482
- I've meant to.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.108
I offered you the job,

31:40.524 --> 31:42.108
took you under my wing

31:42.150 --> 31:43.276
it's part of the deal.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.111
Great,

31:43.318 --> 31:45.111
I'd love your feedback.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.530
Go on and sit.

31:49.449 --> 31:53.245
I've worked with a lot of young

31:49.449 --> 31:53.245
people over the years

31:53.286 --> 31:54.788
interns, new hires.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.040
I've got a pretty good

31:54.830 --> 31:57.040
gut sense

31:57.082 --> 31:59.793
for peoples' strengths

31:57.082 --> 31:59.793
and weaknesses

31:59.835 --> 32:02.295
'whether they have

31:59.835 --> 32:02.295
that certain something'

32:02.337 --> 32:03.756
'to make it in journalism.'

32:03.797 --> 32:05.632
'It's a tough business.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.632
Lot of stress.'

32:05.674 --> 32:09.595
- Definitely.

32:05.674 --> 32:09.595
- And I have to tell you..

32:09.636 --> 32:10.929
...you don't got it.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.268
Now, guts can be wrong.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.268
Mine's been wrong before.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.353
But not often.

32:18.395 --> 32:21.732
I thought

32:18.395 --> 32:21.732
I was doing okay.

32:21.774 --> 32:25.068
I just don't think

32:21.774 --> 32:25.068
you really have the drive

32:25.110 --> 32:27.487
to put yourself out there,

32:25.110 --> 32:27.487
to be honest.

32:27.529 --> 32:28.864
To get a story, to dig.

32:28.906 --> 32:30.490
Just now, in this meeting

32:30.532 --> 32:32.951
I encouraged everyone

32:30.532 --> 32:32.951
to say whatever they wanted.

32:32.992 --> 32:33.993
You said nothing.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.412
I wasn't sure if I should.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.122
Exactly.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.917
I mean, you saw Harry.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.917
He jumped right into the fire.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.919
- You didn't.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.919
- But Harry's not an intern.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.088
'Doesn't matter.'

32:45.130 --> 32:47.132
I've always done

32:45.130 --> 32:47.132
what's asked of me.

32:47.173 --> 32:49.760
See, the thing is,

32:47.173 --> 32:49.760
in the real world

32:49.802 --> 32:52.888
it's not always good enough

32:49.802 --> 32:52.888
to do just what's asked to.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.973
But, I thought I was in a really

32:52.930 --> 32:54.973
good rhythm with everyone here.

32:55.014 --> 32:56.975
I'm not saying

32:55.014 --> 32:56.975
you're not competent.

32:57.016 --> 32:59.728
You're smart. You're terrific

32:57.016 --> 32:59.728
at anticipating needs.

32:59.770 --> 33:02.355
Actually, you'd make

32:59.770 --> 33:02.355
a great assistant.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.357
- Oh.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.357
- 'I'm sorry.'

33:04.399 --> 33:06.693
It's not my pleasure

33:04.399 --> 33:06.693
to disappoint someone like you.

33:06.735 --> 33:09.154
Especially you..

33:09.195 --> 33:11.072
...what, with

33:09.195 --> 33:11.072
the extenuating circumstances.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.992
'But it's healthy.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.992
I don't know any other way.'

33:14.033 --> 33:15.577
'I don't B.S.'

33:15.619 --> 33:17.245
I should get back.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.750
Hey, listen,

33:19.832 --> 33:21.750
I know this is rough

33:21.792 --> 33:26.421
but I may have just done you

33:21.792 --> 33:26.421
a big favor.

33:26.463 --> 33:29.090
Oh, okay.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.091
Thanks.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.418
He had no contract.

34:03.834 --> 34:05.418
He had nothing in writing.

34:05.460 --> 34:07.295
Granted, his offer matched

34:05.460 --> 34:07.295
the fair-market value

34:07.337 --> 34:10.048
of the property but it was

34:07.337 --> 34:10.048
a rigged-bid situation.

34:10.089 --> 34:12.175
The house wasn't even

34:10.089 --> 34:12.175
officially listed for sale.

34:12.217 --> 34:14.052
It wasn't a rigged bid,

34:12.217 --> 34:14.052
Kirk.

34:14.093 --> 34:15.428
'That's for the courts

34:14.093 --> 34:15.428
to decide.'

34:15.470 --> 34:16.513
Get to the point, Kirk.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.431
The house should be

34:16.555 --> 34:18.431
re-listed.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.893
You should take the best offer

34:18.473 --> 34:20.893
from the person

34:20.934 --> 34:22.519
with the best chance

34:20.934 --> 34:22.519
of securing financing.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.979
That person is me.

34:24.021 --> 34:25.814
Alright and Luke, what do you

34:24.021 --> 34:25.814
have to say to that?

34:25.856 --> 34:27.858
What the hell are we doing

34:25.856 --> 34:27.858
in a stream room?

34:27.900 --> 34:30.068
Luke, I explained that if you

34:27.900 --> 34:30.068
wanted to see the town elders

34:30.109 --> 34:31.570
you had to do it

34:30.109 --> 34:31.570
on their terms.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.446
This is ridiculous.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.446
I can't think in here.

34:33.488 --> 34:34.698
You should strip

34:33.488 --> 34:34.698
and get in a towel.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.616
I'm not getting

34:34.740 --> 34:36.616
in a towel.

34:36.658 --> 34:37.743
I think

34:36.658 --> 34:37.743
he's got body issues.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.036
I don't have body issues.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.620
I just don't agree

34:39.077 --> 34:40.620
with what's going on

34:40.662 --> 34:42.330
<i>how</i> it's going on.

34:42.372 --> 34:44.290
Town elders, I don't think it's

34:42.372 --> 34:44.290
appropriate for the defendant

34:44.332 --> 34:45.876
to address you

34:44.332 --> 34:45.876
in this tone, is it?

34:45.918 --> 34:47.669
I'm not the defendant, Kirk.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.669
This isn't a court.

34:47.711 --> 34:49.254
It's not even a room.

34:47.711 --> 34:49.254
It's a box full of hot air.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.756
Now he's insulting you.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.465
Listen, old guys,

34:50.797 --> 34:52.465
I should get the house.

34:52.507 --> 34:53.967
Watch your manners,

34:52.507 --> 34:53.967
young man.

34:54.009 --> 34:55.385
I can get a loan.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.888
But I have deep pockets.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.888
Not now, I mean.

34:57.930 --> 35:00.181
Right now I'm naked,

34:57.930 --> 35:00.181
but my pants have pockets.

35:00.223 --> 35:01.850
Who are you guys, anyway?

35:01.892 --> 35:03.727
What gives you the authority

35:01.892 --> 35:03.727
to make town decisions?

35:03.769 --> 35:05.395
Luke, this isn't helping.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.188
He's a hothead with body issues

35:05.437 --> 35:07.188
and shallow pockets.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.775
This isn't right.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.775
Taylor and I had an agreement.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.860
He needs therapy

35:09.816 --> 35:11.860
and probably pills.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.278
Luke should get the house.

35:13.319 --> 35:14.988
- What?

35:15.030 --> 35:16.531
'It's the right thing

35:15.030 --> 35:16.531
to do.'

35:16.573 --> 35:18.784
Kirk may have a better claim,

35:16.573 --> 35:18.784
technically.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.744
- But Luke wants it more.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.744
- But--

35:20.786 --> 35:23.288
I knew Luke's father,

35:20.786 --> 35:23.288
his grandfather.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.330
We all did.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.624
He'll care for the house

35:25.665 --> 35:27.375
because he cares

35:25.665 --> 35:27.375
so much about it.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.127
He wants it

35:27.417 --> 35:29.127
for him and Lorelai.

35:29.168 --> 35:30.670
For me and..

35:30.712 --> 35:32.005
did you?

35:32.047 --> 35:33.673
We all watched Luke

35:32.047 --> 35:33.673
pine for Lorelai

35:33.715 --> 35:35.467
for nine long years.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.135
He waited for her

35:37.176 --> 35:38.845
while she went through

35:37.176 --> 35:38.845
her many relationships.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.430
He won her.

35:40.472 --> 35:43.976
Now he wants this for her

35:40.472 --> 35:43.976
and for the others.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.560
Others?

35:44.017 --> 35:45.560
What others?

35:45.602 --> 35:47.020
You'll bring children

35:45.602 --> 35:47.020
into the house.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.563
I'll bring children

35:47.062 --> 35:48.563
into the house, too.

35:48.605 --> 35:49.898
Maybe not my own.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.109
It's right for Luke

35:49.940 --> 35:52.109
to have it.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.401
Kirk is young.

35:53.443 --> 35:55.236
There'll be other places

35:53.443 --> 35:55.236
for him to go.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.489
- That's what I think.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.489
- Well, I agree.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.324
Me, too.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.324
Luke should get the house.

35:59.365 --> 36:00.450
Rip!

36:00.492 --> 36:03.495
Thank you.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.495
Thank you, sir.

36:03.536 --> 36:06.247
Hey, Luke, it's a big yard

36:03.536 --> 36:06.247
you'll have there a lot of lawn.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.624
I was wondering

36:06.289 --> 36:07.624
if we could talk

36:07.666 --> 36:09.042
about my rendering

36:07.666 --> 36:09.042
gardening services.

36:09.084 --> 36:10.085
I have tools.

36:10.127 --> 36:11.461
<i>Syrustey.</i>

36:11.503 --> 36:12.838
<i>Syrustey.</i>

36:12.879 --> 36:14.255
Fantastic.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.800
And where is your town,

36:14.297 --> 36:16.800
<i>Syrustey?</i>

36:16.842 --> 36:18.384
Just outside Moscow.

36:18.426 --> 36:19.636
It sounds wonderful.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.805
Our people die

36:19.678 --> 36:21.805
very young there.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.141
Oh, well,

36:21.847 --> 36:24.141
that doesn't sound so good.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.143
- What's in the bag?

36:24.182 --> 36:26.143
- Hmm?

36:26.184 --> 36:27.978
You've been clutching

36:26.184 --> 36:27.978
that bag all night.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.688
- What's in it?

36:28.020 --> 36:29.688
- She's got mystery bag.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.815
A mystery bag, yes!

36:29.729 --> 36:31.815
What's in the mystery bag?

36:31.857 --> 36:36.069
Oh, well, um,

36:31.857 --> 36:36.069
this is my cover story.

36:36.111 --> 36:37.946
Your cover story, I thought it

36:36.111 --> 36:37.946
wasn't coming out for two weeks.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.238
Let me see that.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.491
Okay.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.951
Lorelai owns an inn.

36:42.993 --> 36:45.286
What would you call it,

36:42.993 --> 36:45.286
maybe a<i> dacha?</i>

36:45.328 --> 36:46.412
<i>Dacha,</i> yes.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.873
- This is it.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.873
- Oh, fantastic.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.041
Thank you.

36:49.082 --> 36:50.333
Great<i> dacha,</i> this<i> dacha!</i>

36:50.375 --> 36:51.877
Are there other pictures

36:50.375 --> 36:51.877
with the article?

36:51.918 --> 36:53.461
Uh-huh,

36:51.918 --> 36:53.461
go ahead and read it.

36:53.503 --> 36:55.047
We have time before dinner,

36:53.503 --> 36:55.047
right?

36:55.088 --> 36:57.049
We can't start dinner

36:55.088 --> 36:57.049
until Rory gets here.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.925
You're going to love

36:57.090 --> 36:58.925
my granddaughter.

36:58.967 --> 37:01.302
You'll just want to pick her up

36:58.967 --> 37:01.302
and throw her in the air.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.596
Give one to Mikhail.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.596
It's how he's learning English.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.391
Got plenty to go around.

37:06.432 --> 37:08.267
Oh, gorgeous!

37:08.309 --> 37:09.477
Yes.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.522
It's a rave.

37:12.564 --> 37:13.648
We got lucky.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.243
I'll be right back.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.703
Where are you going?

37:26.745 --> 37:28.747
Oh, I'll just be right back.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.747
Sit, Mikhail.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.332
I didn't mean that as a command.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.332
But, please, have a seat.

37:31.374 --> 37:32.751
I'll just,

37:31.374 --> 37:32.751
I'm gonna..

37:42.468 --> 37:45.180
(Emily)

37:42.468 --> 37:45.180
'Oh, my God.'

37:45.222 --> 37:47.599
'Oh, my God!'

37:47.640 --> 37:50.936
'Lorelai?

37:47.640 --> 37:50.936
Lorelai, are you in there?'

37:50.977 --> 37:52.145
No.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.354
[door handle rattles]

37:53.396 --> 37:55.273
- Come out of there.

37:53.396 --> 37:55.273
- No.

37:55.314 --> 37:57.567
[rattling continues]

37:57.609 --> 37:58.902
'This is pathetic!'

37:58.944 --> 38:00.319
I know.

38:00.361 --> 38:01.988
- The things you say in this.

38:00.361 --> 38:01.988
- I know.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.698
'Calling me pol pot.'

38:03.740 --> 38:07.202
Mom, it was meant as a joke, the

38:03.740 --> 38:07.202
pol pot, the walking anthrax.

38:07.244 --> 38:09.037
I was just being edgy,

38:07.244 --> 38:09.037
like Chris Rock.

38:09.079 --> 38:10.705
'Walking anthrax!'

38:10.747 --> 38:11.748
You haven't gotten to

38:10.747 --> 38:11.748
that part yet?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.083
'No!'

38:13.125 --> 38:14.751
Well, something

38:13.125 --> 38:14.751
to look forward to.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.170
'I'm not going to continue

38:14.793 --> 38:17.170
talking through the door.'

38:17.212 --> 38:19.714
Look, I was mad at you when

38:17.212 --> 38:19.714
I did the interview, okay?

38:19.756 --> 38:22.341
And I said things,

38:19.756 --> 38:22.341
but I didn't mean them.

38:22.383 --> 38:25.303
It just happened and I'm not

38:22.383 --> 38:25.303
used to talking to reporters

38:25.344 --> 38:26.596
and I didn't know about

38:25.344 --> 38:26.596
the whole off-the-record

38:26.638 --> 38:27.847
on-the-record thing,

38:26.638 --> 38:27.847
but I know now

38:27.889 --> 38:30.058
and I'm really sorry

38:27.889 --> 38:30.058
it happened.

38:30.100 --> 38:33.270
'I did not force Jimmy Carter

38:30.100 --> 38:33.270
out of his room at that hotel.'

38:33.311 --> 38:35.438
See, now, that I thought was

38:33.311 --> 38:35.438
just an amusing anecdote.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.191
'I did not get into

38:35.480 --> 38:38.191
a "bitch fight" with him.'

38:38.233 --> 38:39.609
'He's an ex-president!'

38:39.651 --> 38:41.444
'He was with

38:39.651 --> 38:41.444
that insufferable Rosalynn.'

38:41.486 --> 38:44.739
Again, mom, I am really,

38:41.486 --> 38:44.739
really sorry,

38:44.781 --> 38:47.408
and unless

38:44.781 --> 38:47.408
you forgive me

38:47.450 --> 38:49.494
I-I am going to camp out in

38:47.450 --> 38:49.494
here, possibly forever.

38:51.955 --> 38:54.499
M-mom, just don't tell

38:51.955 --> 38:54.499
your friends about the article

38:54.540 --> 38:56.126
so they won't read it.

38:56.168 --> 38:58.170
And the ones who do,

38:56.168 --> 38:58.170
just tell them I was misquoted.

38:58.211 --> 38:59.671
And I would recommend

38:59.712 --> 39:01.923
that you stop reading

38:59.712 --> 39:01.923
the article right now

39:01.965 --> 39:03.967
and just look

39:01.965 --> 39:03.967
at the pictures.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.844
The pictures

39:04.009 --> 39:05.844
are really pretty.

39:08.888 --> 39:11.557
If you are applying

39:08.888 --> 39:11.557
explosives to the door

39:11.599 --> 39:15.478
please tell me,

39:11.599 --> 39:15.478
so I can step away.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.856
'I'll stop reading.'

39:17.897 --> 39:21.151
And we won't talk about it

39:17.897 --> 39:21.151
again, ever.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.319
'Fine. Come out.'

39:28.658 --> 39:31.328
Let's go back

39:28.658 --> 39:31.328
to the living room.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.496
Thank you, mom.

39:33.538 --> 39:34.789
Goodbye, Mrs. Gilmore.

39:34.831 --> 39:36.041
Mikhail,

39:34.831 --> 39:36.041
where are you going?

39:36.082 --> 39:37.083
I must leave.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.544
Leave? Why?

39:37.125 --> 39:39.544
Mikhail?

39:41.754 --> 39:42.714
Mikhail?

39:53.099 --> 39:55.060
Hey!

39:53.099 --> 39:55.060
You're here early.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.394
I guess.

39:56.435 --> 39:57.937
Way early.

39:56.435 --> 39:57.937
Did you skip your dinner?

39:57.979 --> 40:00.023
Come down here,

39:57.979 --> 40:00.023
so we don't have to yell.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.274
I'm sorry.

40:03.318 --> 40:04.694
So, there she is.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.404
- Who?

40:04.736 --> 40:06.404
- The boat.

40:06.445 --> 40:07.989
Calling him "she" is one

40:06.445 --> 40:07.989
of those nautical traditions.

40:08.031 --> 40:10.158
Right, something sexist

40:08.031 --> 40:10.158
in that, I'm sure.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.450
I'm sure.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.496
So, how'd you get away?

40:15.538 --> 40:17.207
I don't know.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.207
I just got away.

40:17.249 --> 40:18.208
I'm glad.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.625
So, who's she?

40:19.667 --> 40:21.753
- Who?

40:19.667 --> 40:21.753
- The girl on the boat.

40:21.794 --> 40:22.754
Okay, I'm sorry.

40:22.795 --> 40:23.880
We were just calling

40:22.795 --> 40:23.880
the boat a she.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.006
I'm little bit behind,

40:23.922 --> 40:25.006
but I'm catching up.

40:25.048 --> 40:26.216
She's a friend

40:25.048 --> 40:26.216
of my sister's.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.175
Well, I didn't mean

40:26.258 --> 40:27.175
to interrupt anything.

40:27.217 --> 40:28.676
You weren't interrupting

40:27.217 --> 40:28.676
anything.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.511
- Looked like I was.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.511
- I've known her forever.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.138
Well, I didn't mean

40:30.553 --> 40:32.138
to pull you away.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.099
We were just talking,

40:32.180 --> 40:34.099
me, her and her husband.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.767
If you want, I can have them

40:34.140 --> 40:35.767
pull out pictures

40:35.808 --> 40:37.018
of their 2-year-old.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.103
Ben has them

40:37.060 --> 40:38.103
in his jacket party.

40:38.144 --> 40:39.145
Do you even want me here?

40:39.187 --> 40:41.189
Ace, I invited you here.

40:41.231 --> 40:43.149
Right, on a Friday night,

40:41.231 --> 40:43.149
when you knew I couldn't come.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.318
It's my sister's party.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.318
I didn't pick the night.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.112
Traffic sucked getting here.

40:47.153 --> 40:49.406
Sorry, but I can't do anything

40:47.153 --> 40:49.406
about the traffic, either.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.949
Can we just, um..

40:53.368 --> 40:54.744
...what the hell's wrong

40:53.368 --> 40:54.744
with you?

40:54.786 --> 40:56.746
Nothing.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.746
I'm just in a weird mood.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.290
I'll say.

40:58.331 --> 41:00.417
I'm sorry, I just,

40:58.331 --> 41:00.417
can we go somewhere else?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.210
- What?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.210
- Let's go somewhere else.

41:02.252 --> 41:04.129
I don't really feel like

41:02.252 --> 41:04.129
being around people.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.588
- Okay, name it.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.588
- Will your sister mind?

41:05.630 --> 41:06.923
I've been here

41:05.630 --> 41:06.923
an hour and a half

41:06.965 --> 41:08.383
I've talked to everybody

41:06.965 --> 41:08.383
and my duty's done.

41:08.425 --> 41:10.093
- Where do you want to go?

41:08.425 --> 41:10.093
- I don't know.

41:10.135 --> 41:13.138
Somewhere...far...out there.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.014
Where?

41:15.056 --> 41:17.934
- Out to sea.

41:15.056 --> 41:17.934
- Out to sea?

41:17.976 --> 41:20.770
Let's take that fancy-pantsy

41:17.976 --> 41:20.770
yacht of yours for a spin.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.021
Tricky, since

41:20.812 --> 41:22.021
it's about the head out

41:22.063 --> 41:23.773
with all my sister's friends

41:22.063 --> 41:23.773
on it.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.650
Oh, well, don't you have

41:23.815 --> 41:25.650
another one?

41:25.691 --> 41:27.360
- Not here.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.360
- Where's the other one?

41:27.402 --> 41:29.695
Far away. Let's just drive to

41:27.402 --> 41:29.695
somewhere else go to New York.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.323
I don't want to drive.

41:31.364 --> 41:32.991
I want to be out there,

41:31.364 --> 41:32.991
just the two of us, alone.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.367
Well..

41:34.409 --> 41:35.452
You know the beginning

41:34.409 --> 41:35.452
of "Moby Dick"

41:35.493 --> 41:36.953
when the narrator says

41:36.995 --> 41:38.913
that when he finds himself

41:36.995 --> 41:38.913
"growing grim about the mouth"

41:38.955 --> 41:40.581
and wanting to knock

41:38.955 --> 41:40.581
peoples' hats off

41:40.623 --> 41:41.582
he takes to the sea?

41:41.624 --> 41:42.834
Yeah.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.502
Well, I feel like knocking

41:42.875 --> 41:44.502
peoples' hats off.

41:44.543 --> 41:46.171
So I guess we got to take

41:44.543 --> 41:46.171
to the sea.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.091
That one looks good.

41:50.133 --> 41:51.676
Yeah?

41:51.717 --> 41:53.345
Nice and seaworthy.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.972
Not ours to take.

41:56.014 --> 41:59.392
That ever stopped you

41:56.014 --> 41:59.392
before?

41:59.434 --> 42:01.227
I think I've been a bad

41:59.434 --> 42:01.227
influence on you, Ace.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.062
Let's go, Huntzberger.

42:03.104 --> 42:04.063
Let's go.

42:06.107 --> 42:09.527
See, I was mad at mom,

42:06.107 --> 42:09.527
Mrs. Gilmore here, at the time

42:09.568 --> 42:11.321
and I ended up saying things

42:09.568 --> 42:11.321
I shouldn't have said

42:11.363 --> 42:12.822
because you see, normally

42:12.864 --> 42:14.366
I-I don't make jokes

42:12.864 --> 42:14.366
about Joseph Stalin.

42:14.407 --> 42:16.201
'They're inappropriate.'

42:16.242 --> 42:19.371
'I just said it in jest to this

42:16.242 --> 42:19.371
writer, and she printed it.'

42:19.412 --> 42:20.621
'I mean,

42:19.412 --> 42:20.621
she's not Joseph Stalin'

42:20.663 --> 42:22.374
'and not that this

42:20.663 --> 42:22.374
is any excuse'

42:22.415 --> 42:25.168
but there's no way I could have

42:22.415 --> 42:25.168
known that a Russian man

42:25.210 --> 42:27.420
whose entire family and their

42:25.210 --> 42:27.420
village was killed by Stalin

42:27.462 --> 42:29.172
would be reading this

42:27.462 --> 42:29.172
in front of me.

42:29.214 --> 42:30.756
'I mean, there's just no way.'

42:30.798 --> 42:32.509
She has this off-putting sense

42:30.798 --> 42:32.509
of humor, Mikhail.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.177
You'd know that if you spent

42:32.550 --> 42:34.177
time with her.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.428
Yes, you would.

42:34.219 --> 42:35.428
You would know that.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.055
Yes.

42:37.096 --> 42:39.432
Joseph Stalin was a monster.

42:37.096 --> 42:39.432
Please stay.

42:39.474 --> 42:42.727
You just caught us

42:39.474 --> 42:42.727
on a bad day.

42:42.768 --> 42:43.811
Alright.

[cellphone rings]

42:46.689 --> 42:47.648
This must be Rory.

42:46.689 --> 42:47.648
Excuse me.

42:51.194 --> 42:52.862
- Hello.

42:51.194 --> 42:52.862
- 'Mom.'

42:52.904 --> 42:56.241
Hey, when are you getting here?

42:52.904 --> 42:56.241
I really really want you here.

42:56.282 --> 42:57.742
You need to come

42:56.282 --> 42:57.742
and get me.

42:57.783 --> 43:00.286
Where are you?
