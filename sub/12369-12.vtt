WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:03.044
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.128 --> 00:06.464
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.925
- I HOPE HE'S NOT
GOING TO PLAY GOLF TODAY.

00:09.008 --> 00:12.929
- I HOPE SHE WON'T GET MAD
IF I PLAY GOLF TODAY.

00:13.012 --> 00:14.180
- I HATE GOLF.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.474
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH IT ANYWAY?

00:16.558 --> 00:18.476
- I COULD SKIP IT,
BUT, GOD, I LOVE GOLF.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.270
AND I LOOK GOOD WHEN I GOLF.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.272
I MEAN, I'M ASSUMING.

00:22.355 --> 00:25.650
NO, I DO.
I DO.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.777
- BUT IF HE PLAYS GOLF,
I WON'T SEE HIM ALL DAY.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.823
STUPID GOLF.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.616
- HEY, YOU WANT
TO PLAY GOLF WITH ME TODAY?

00:33.700 --> 00:37.120
- I'D LOVE TO!

00:37.203 --> 00:39.122
- IT'S FUNNY.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.916
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO
WAS TO COME TO CLEVELAND.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.462
AND NOW THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO IS LEAVE.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.797
- SO...WHAT NOW, MY LOVE?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.466
- WELL, MY EVENING'S FREE.

00:49.549 --> 00:53.094
HOW ABOUT WE TRY LIVING
HAPPILY EVER AFTER?

00:53.178 --> 00:54.971
- OH.

00:55.054 --> 00:56.264
- [laughs]

00:56.347 --> 00:58.183
WOW, VICTORIA.

00:58.266 --> 01:03.188
WHO KNEW YOU COULD ACT?

01:03.271 --> 01:04.522
- SOON THE WHOLE WORLD
WILL KNOW.

01:04.605 --> 01:05.690
- WELL, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,

01:05.774 --> 01:07.650
I HAVE BEEN ACTING
FOR SOME TIME.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.860
- OF COURSE, DARLING.

01:08.943 --> 01:11.112
BUT THIS IS
YOUR FIRST OSCAR-WORTHY SCENE

01:11.196 --> 01:12.322
IN A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.991
- EMMET, WOULD YOU MIND
TAKING A PICTURE

01:15.074 --> 01:17.869
WITH FLAT STANLEY?

01:20.121 --> 01:23.875
WOULD YOU MOVE ASIDE,
FLAT VICTORIA?

01:25.251 --> 01:26.836
- ELKA'S BOYFRIEND PIERRE

01:26.920 --> 01:28.338
HAS A GRANDSON WHO NEEDS
PICTURES OF STANLEY

01:28.421 --> 01:31.216
IN DIFFERENT PLACES
FOR HIS SCHOOL.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.551
- [chuckles]
NOW, I MUST GET GOING.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.011
I HAVE A LAST-DAY RITUAL

01:35.094 --> 01:37.180
WHERE I LEARN THE NAMES
OF EVERYONE ON THE CREW,

01:37.263 --> 01:39.724
SO THEY THINK I KNEW THEM
ALL THE TIME.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.851
- I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.686
- HE IS SO CHARMING.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.980
- AND HANDSOME.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.191
- AND HE MAKES VICTORIA
SO HAPPY.

01:48.274 --> 01:50.693
- I AM MISERABLE.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.028
- WHAT? WHAT'S THE MATTER?

01:52.111 --> 01:53.488
- WELL, THE MOVIE'S
OVER TOMORROW,

01:53.571 --> 01:54.906
AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

01:54.989 --> 01:56.074
BETWEEN EMMET AND ME.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.992
- WHY HAVEN'T YOU TWO
TALKED ABOUT IT?

01:58.076 --> 02:00.328
- BECAUSE EVERY ANSWER
TO THE QUESTION "WHAT'S NEXT?"

02:00.411 --> 02:02.330
IS MESSY.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.040
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHERE HIS NEXT PROJECT IS.

02:04.123 --> 02:05.500
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE MINE IS.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.751
AND I DON'T WANT
TO MAKE DEMANDS

02:06.835 --> 02:09.545
LIKE SOME WHINY FEMALE.

02:09.628 --> 02:10.588
- [whining] WELL,
YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.382
YOU LIVE WITH US.

02:12.465 --> 02:17.554
- EXACTLY, MELANIE.
NOBODY WANTS TO SOUND LIKE THAT.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.596
I JUST WISH
THAT WE COULD KEEP ON

02:18.680 --> 02:20.682
SHOOTING THIS MOVIE FOREVER.

02:20.765 --> 02:22.350
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW I'M GOING

02:22.433 --> 02:23.393
TO GET THROUGH THIS LAST SCENE

02:23.476 --> 02:24.727
WITHOUT FALLING APART.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.062
- YOU NEED MORAL SUPPORT?

02:26.145 --> 02:27.605
I'LL CANCEL MY INTERVIEW
FOR THE INTERNSHIP

02:27.689 --> 02:28.940
AND COME WITH YOU TO THE SET.

02:29.023 --> 02:30.400
- OH, NO, JOY.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.277
YOU REALLY WANT THAT INTERNSHIP.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.404
- WELL, THEN I'LL CANCEL
MY PLANS WITH ALEC.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.905
- OH, HONEY, I COULDN'T
ASK YOU TO DO THAT.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.783
- WELL, SOMEONE
SHOULD GO WITH YOU.

02:48.877 --> 02:52.881
- [grumbling]
I'LL DO IT.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.559
{\an8}- WOW!

03:04.642 --> 03:06.102
{\an8}[laughing] YOU ARE
REALLY GOOD AT THIS.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.437
{\an8}THAT WENT, LIKE, A MILE.

03:07.520 --> 03:08.897
{\an8}YOU SHOULD DO THIS
PROFESSIONALLY.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.106
{\an8}- WHAT, YOU THINK?

03:10.189 --> 03:11.399
{\an8}NAH.

03:11.482 --> 03:14.152
{\an8}WELL, MAYBE.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.447
{\an8}YOU KNOW, I HAVE NEVER GOLFED
WITH A GIRLFRIEND BEFORE,

03:17.530 --> 03:19.949
{\an8}AND...I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
TO EXPECT.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.075
{\an8}BUT, I GOT TO TELL YOU,

03:21.159 --> 03:22.368
{\an8}I'M LIKING IT A LOT.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.078
{\an8}- YEAH? SO AM I.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.123
{\an8}- AND YOU LOOK REALLY HOT
IN YOUR GOLF CLOTHES.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.583
{\an8}I MEAN, LIKE,
DISTRACTINGLY HOT.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.836
{\an8}- AND YOU LOOK REALLY,
REALLY GOOD PLAYING GOLF.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.755
{\an8}- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.132
{\an8}GOLF'S, LIKE,
MY FAVORITE THING TO DO.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.927
{\an8}WELL, THAT AND SEX.

03:39.010 --> 03:41.137
{\an8}- HAVE YOU EVER COMBINED THEM?

03:41.220 --> 03:42.680
{\an8}- NO.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.933
{\an8}HOW WOULD YOU?

03:45.016 --> 03:47.143
{\an8}<i>WHERE</i> WOULD YOU?

03:47.226 --> 03:50.229
{\an8}SERIOUSLY, WHERE WOULD YOU?

03:58.571 --> 03:59.822
- HELLO, FUNNY FACE.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.908
- YOU.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.993
YOU'RE HERE.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.536
- I COULDN'T GET ON THAT PLANE.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.330
IT'S CRAZY.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.165
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO
WAS TO COME TO CLEVELAND.

04:09.248 --> 04:11.542
NOW THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO
IS TO LEAVE.

04:11.626 --> 04:15.505
- SO...WHAT NOW, MY LOVE?

04:15.588 --> 04:18.341
- WELL, MY EVENING IS FREE.

04:18.423 --> 04:23.054
WHY DON'T WE TRY LIVING
HAPPILY EVER AFTER?

04:23.137 --> 04:26.891
- GUESS WHO JUST TOOK A SHOWER
WITH RYAN GOSLING?

04:29.894 --> 04:33.731
WET FLAT STANLEY.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.817
- AND RYAN SAID THAT WAS OKAY?

04:35.900 --> 04:38.695
- WELL, HE DIDN'T SAY NO.

04:38.778 --> 04:42.323
LOUDLY ENOUGH.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.575
- WE WERE JUST RUNNING
THE LAST SCENE.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.244
- OH, I LIKE
THAT YOU TWO GET TOGETHER

04:46.327 --> 04:48.121
IN THE END.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.205
DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA LAST?

04:49.288 --> 04:50.498
- OH, DEFINITELY.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.208
I MEAN, THEY'RE SO WELL-SUITED.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.043
EVEN THOUGH HIS WORK
TAKES HIM ALL OVER THE WORLD,

04:54.127 --> 04:56.087
I'M SURE THEY'LL FIND A WAY
TO WORK IT OUT.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.880
DON'T YOU THINK SO, EMMET?

04:57.964 --> 04:59.882
- I GIVE IT THREE MONTHS.
- WHAT?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.843
- DARLING, HE'S
A WORLD-RENOWNED CONDUCTOR

05:01.926 --> 05:03.219
WHO CAME TO CLEVELAND

05:03.302 --> 05:05.555
AND REKINDLED A ROMANCE
WITH HIS EX-WIFE.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.223
AS SOON AS THE GLOW WEARS OFF,

05:07.306 --> 05:08.975
HE'LL REALIZE IT WAS
JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.227
- JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS?
- EXACTLY.

05:11.310 --> 05:12.770
- WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE,
HAVEN'T WE? HMM?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.897
NOW YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.400
I HAVE A FITTING
WITH HEAD COSTUMER LORI.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.278
HEY, THERE, KEY GRIP SEAN.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.033
- WELL, I GUESS
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR

05:25.116 --> 05:27.744
WHAT EMMET WAS TRYING
TO TELL ME, HUH?

05:27.827 --> 05:30.121
YOU JUST REPLACE
WORLD-RENOWNED CONDUCTOR

05:30.204 --> 05:32.749
WITH WORLD-RENOWNED ACTOR.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.792
EITHER WAY,

05:34.876 --> 05:37.879
THERE'S A WOMAN LEFT BEHIND
IN CLEVELAND.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.964
- BUT YOU'RE NOT HIS EX-WIFE.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.301
- [crying]
AND NOW I NEVER WILL BE.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.389
- [giggling]

05:48.473 --> 05:51.601
- SERIOUSLY, YOU ARE, LIKE,
THE BEST GIRLFRIEND EVER.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.145
I OWE YOU, LIKE, 40 HOURS
IN AN OUTLET MALL.

05:54.228 --> 05:56.105
- DO YOU MIND IF WE GO BACK
TO THE CLUBHOUSE?

05:56.189 --> 05:57.565
I JUST WANT
TO FRESHEN UP A LITTLE BIT.

05:57.648 --> 05:59.108
- YEAH, SURE. THERE'S A COMB
IN MY BAG, IF YOU WANT.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.485
- OH, THANKS.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.114
IS THIS MY TOOTHBRUSH?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.116
- YEAH, YOU LEFT IT
AT MY PLACE THIS MORNING.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.743
- SO YOU BROUGHT IT TO ME?

06:08.826 --> 06:10.078
- FIGURED YOU MIGHT WANT IT.

06:10.161 --> 06:13.289
AM I A GREAT BOYFRIEND
OR WHAT?

06:13.372 --> 06:14.165
I TELL YOU,

06:14.248 --> 06:15.041
IF BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN
IS WAITING FOR US

06:15.124 --> 06:17.043
AT THE NEXT TEE
WITH A PLATE OF RIBS,

06:17.126 --> 06:22.423
THIS'LL BE THE BEST DAY
OF MY LIFE.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.801
- SO, YOU WANT TO INTERN
WITH A PRIVATE DETECTIVE

06:24.884 --> 06:26.260
FOR COLLEGE CREDIT.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.304
- YES, I'M MAJORING
IN CRIMINOLOGY.

06:28.387 --> 06:30.098
AND I THOUGHT
THIS SUITS ME MORE

06:30.181 --> 06:32.475
THAN INTERNING
WITH THE POLICE.

06:32.558 --> 06:36.562
WHO SAID NO TO ME
ANYWAY.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.980
- SO WHAT DOES YOUR HUSBAND
THINK ABOUT ALL THIS?

06:38.064 --> 06:39.315
- I'M NOT MARRIED.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.359
- YEAH, I NOTICED
YOU WEREN'T WEARING A RING.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.819
I'M A PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.363
THAT'S THE SORT
OF THING I NOTICE.

06:45.446 --> 06:49.742
HEY, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT!
I'M ALSO NOT WEARING A RING.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.661
ANYWAY...

06:51.744 --> 06:53.996
BEING A PRIVATE DETECTIVE,
IT'S NOT ALL THAT GLAMOROUS.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.249
MOSTLY YOU'RE
ON SURVEILLANCE FOR HOURS,

06:56.332 --> 06:58.042
SITTING IN A COLD CAR,
TRYING TO GET EVIDENCE

06:58.126 --> 07:00.044
THAT SOME GUY'S
BEING UNFAITHFUL.

07:00.128 --> 07:03.005
- I'VE BEEN DOING THAT
SINCE I WAS 12.

07:03.089 --> 07:07.677
- WELL, WE'LL BE WORKING
TOGETHER A LOT.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.847
SO RULE NUMBER ONE...

07:10.930 --> 07:15.017
YOU CAN'T FALL IN LOVE
WITH ME.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.062
- THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.522
- GOOD.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.649
'CAUSE WE'LL BE WORKING A LOT
OF LATE NIGHTS.

07:21.732 --> 07:22.775
MAYBE WE'LL SHARE SOMETHING.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.986
MAYBE A TUBE OF PRINGLES.

07:25.069 --> 07:27.530
OUR HANDS
MAY ACCIDENTALLY TOUCH.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.158
- STILL NOT A PROBLEM.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.826
- GOOD TO KNOW,
GOOD TO KNOW.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.327
BUT I OUGHT TO WARN YOU,

07:33.411 --> 07:34.537
I'M THINKING
ABOUT WORKING OUT,

07:34.620 --> 07:35.746
MAYBE EATING BETTER.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.917
YOU KNOW, MAYBE GETTING DOWN
TO A 36 WAIST.

07:40.001 --> 07:43.713
WOULD YOU FIND THAT...
PROVOCATIVE?

07:43.796 --> 07:45.715
- NOT PARTICULARLY.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.967
- EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.

07:48.050 --> 07:49.385
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:49.468 --> 07:50.219
I'M GONNA START YOU OUT
WITH A TEST CASE.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.096
THIS ONE HAPPENS
TO INVOLVE MY DAD.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.890
HE'S BEEN GIVING MONEY
TO SOME WOMAN,

07:53.973 --> 07:55.266
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.726
I WAS TAILING HER,

07:56.809 --> 07:58.394
BUT SHE LOST ME.

07:58.477 --> 08:00.021
BUT I DID MANAGE
TO GET THIS PICTURE.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.898
SO IF YOU WANT TO WORK HERE,

08:01.981 --> 08:03.399
YOU FIND OUT WHO THIS WOMAN IS

08:03.482 --> 08:06.277
AND WHERE SHE LIVES.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.408
- THAT'S ELKA OSTROVSKY.

08:12.491 --> 08:15.077
AND SHE LIVES
AT 68 CEDARCLIFF ROAD.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.331
- WOW, YOU'RE GOOD.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.129
- I KNOW ELKA'S BEEN
UP TO SOMETHING FOR MONTHS--

08:25.213 --> 08:26.756
LARGE WADS OF CASH,

08:26.839 --> 08:28.382
MYSTERIOUS TRIPS
WITH HER FRIENDS--

08:28.466 --> 08:29.800
BUT SHE WON'T ADMIT
TO ANYTHING.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.344
- WE NEED TO SET UP
HIDDEN SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

08:31.427 --> 08:33.929
OUTSIDE HER PLACE
TO FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.057
- WHAT? WELL, I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT THAT.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.767
I NEED TO TALK
TO MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.808
- NO, YOU CAN'T.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.102
I MEAN,
ONCE YOU'RE ON A CASE,

08:40.186 --> 08:41.102
YOU CAN'T DISCUSS
IT WITH ANYONE.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.230
IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.148
AND IT'S MY SECOND RULE.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.235
NEXT TO NOT FALLING
IN LOVE WITH ME.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.111
- WHICH I WON'T.
- BECAUSE YOU MUSTN'T.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.947
- SO, I SHAN'T.
- BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.740
- BUT I DON'T.
- BECAUSE YOU DAREN'T.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.450
- WHAT?

08:54.533 --> 08:57.370
- JOY, THIS IS EXACTLY
THE SORT OF HEATED BANTER

08:57.453 --> 09:00.623
THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT HARD FOR US
NOT TO BREAK ALL THE RULES.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.084
PRINGLE?

09:05.378 --> 09:08.464
- OKAY, PLACES FOR REHEARSAL.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.800
- SO, WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU

09:10.883 --> 09:13.594
AFTER WE WRAP THIS PICTURE,
SIR EMMET?

09:13.678 --> 09:15.680
- WELL, I'M FIELDING
A FEW OFFERS.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.724
I HAD MY FUN HERE,
BUT I'M READY TO MOVE ON.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.811
NEW PLACES, NEW FACES.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.480
- WE'RE READY
FOR YOUR ENTRANCE, VICTORIA!

09:24.563 --> 09:28.776
AND...ACTION.

09:28.859 --> 09:29.986
- HELLO, FUNNY FACE.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.988
- [disappointed]
OH, YOU.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.157
YOU'RE HERE.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.993
- I COULDN'T GET ON THAT PLANE.

09:37.076 --> 09:38.828
IT'S FUNNY.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.831
THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO
WAS TO COME TO CLEVELAND.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.666
NOW THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO IS LEAVE.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.126
- OH, GO AHEAD AND LEAVE.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.461
WHO WANTS YOU?

09:47.545 --> 09:50.172
- DARLING, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S THE RIGHT LINE.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.799
AND IT'S COMING OFF
A LITTLE HOSTILE.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.135
- WELL, HOSTILE IS BETTER
THAN PHONY.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.970
AT LEAST I DIDN'T WAIT
UNTIL THE LAST DAY

09:56.053 --> 09:57.471
TO LEARN THE NAMES OF THE CREW.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.889
EVEN YOU, LARRY.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.475
- IT'S GARY.
- CLOSE ENOUGH.

10:03.602 --> 10:06.480
IT WAS EMBARRASSING
AND UNPROFESSIONAL,

10:06.564 --> 10:08.691
BUT I JUST COULDN'T
GET THROUGH THAT SCENE.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.526
- WELL, HOW DID YOU LEAVE IT
WITH EMMET?

10:10.609 --> 10:13.195
- HE CAME BY MY TRAILER,
AND I PRETENDED I WASN'T THERE.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.989
THAT'S REALLY MATURE.

10:15.072 --> 10:17.325
- YEAH, THE GREAT THING
ABOUT LOVE

10:17.408 --> 10:18.868
IS IT MAKES YOU FEEL
LIKE A TEENAGER.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.413
BAD THING ABOUT LOVE
IS IT MAKES YOU ACT LIKE ONE.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.914
I MEAN, I HAVE A THING...

10:23.998 --> 10:26.542
WHICH I HOPE ISN'T A THING,

10:26.625 --> 10:28.252
BUT IT MIGHT BE A THING.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.879
- OH, MELANIE,
YOU WORRY TOO MUCH.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.172
IT'S PROBABLY NOT A THING.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.882
- I LEFT MY TOOTHBRUSH
AT ALEC'S,

10:32.965 --> 10:34.383
AND HE RETURNED IT.
- OH.

10:34.467 --> 10:38.220
THAT'S A THING.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.056
- HE'S AFRAID
YOU'RE A SPACE INVADER.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.891
- ALL I DID
WAS LEAVE A TOOTHBRUSH.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.225
- YOU KNOW HOW MEN THINK.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.019
FIRST IT'S A TOOTHBRUSH,

10:45.102 --> 10:46.270
THEN YOUR LIPSTICK,

10:46.354 --> 10:47.563
THEN IT SPREADS OUT
OF THE BATHROOM,

10:47.646 --> 10:48.731
AND YOU NEED A DRAWER.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.024
THEN ONE DAY,

10:50.107 --> 10:51.567
YOU BLURT OUT,
"CAN THERE BE ONE WEEKEND

10:51.650 --> 10:52.443
WHERE WE'RE
NOT WATCHING FOOTBALL?"

10:52.526 --> 10:54.111
AND BAM!

10:54.195 --> 10:57.698
HE'S ANTIQUING
WITH HIS BALLS IN YOUR PURSE.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.620
- I LEFT MY GIRDLE
AT PIERRE'S ONCE.

11:02.703 --> 11:03.913
- DID HE GIVE IT BACK?

11:03.996 --> 11:06.290
- HE CLAIMS HE NEVER FOUND IT.

11:06.374 --> 11:09.585
BUT, SOMEHOW,

11:09.668 --> 11:13.172
HE SQUEEZED HIMSELF
INTO THOSE NEW LEATHER PANTS.

11:16.550 --> 11:19.345
- WELL, PUTTING
THAT IMAGE ASIDE,

11:19.428 --> 11:21.597
LEAVE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH
AT ALEC'S AGAIN

11:21.680 --> 11:23.140
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.726
- JOY, YOU ARE BRILLIANT
AND DECEITFUL.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.228
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A GOOD P.I.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.939
- OH, I'M JUST AN INTERN.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.400
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M HOT
ON SOMEBODY'S TRAIL.

11:32.483 --> 11:35.611
[laughs]

11:35.694 --> 11:36.904
CHANGING SUBJECTS--

11:36.987 --> 11:40.116
ELKA, WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO LATELY?

11:40.199 --> 11:41.575
- STUFF.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.286
- WELL, SURELY YOU CAN SAY
MORE THAN THAT.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.123
- STUFF IT.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.631
- OH, GOD,
HE KNOWS WHAT I'M DOING.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.633
HE KNOWS I'M GONNA LEAVE
THIS TOOTHBRUSH.

11:57.716 --> 11:58.634
HOW COULD HE NOT KNOW?

11:58.717 --> 11:59.760
HE'S NOT AN IDIOT.

11:59.844 --> 12:00.803
- FRONT, FRONT, FRONT.

12:00.886 --> 12:04.014
BACK, BACK, BACK.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.021
- OKAY, TOOTHBRUSH.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.108
YOUR MISSION
IS TO HOLD YOUR GROUND.

12:14.191 --> 12:17.278
JUST KNOW THAT
YOU WON'T BE DOING IT ALONE.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.661
- HEY,
LOOK WHERE WE ARE.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.664
IT'S OUR SEX HOLE.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.458
- THERE'S GOT TO BE
A BETTER NAME FOR IT THAN THAT.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.751
NO, I LIKE THAT ONE.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.712
- HEY, DO YOU HAVE A TEE?

12:34.795 --> 12:36.172
- LOOK AT YOU,
WITH THE GOLF TERMS.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.381
LAST TIME WE PLAYED,

12:37.465 --> 12:40.843
YOU CALLED IT
"A LITTLE WOODEN NAIL THINGY."

12:40.926 --> 12:45.181
YEAH, THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH
IN MY BAG.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.474
- WHAT'S THIS?

12:46.557 --> 12:48.017
- THAT IS A PRESENT.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.018
I WAS GONNA GIVE IT
TO YOU LATER.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.686
- A TOILETRY KIT.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.313
WITH MY TOOTHBRUSH.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.190
AND MY LIPSTICK.

12:54.273 --> 12:57.651
AND THERE'S ROOM FOR TOOTHPASTE,
DEODORANT, A RAZOR.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.320
I FIGURED YOU COULD KEEP THAT
IN YOUR CAR,

12:59.403 --> 13:00.488
NIGHTS YOU STAY WITH ME.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.656
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET
ANOTHER ONE...

13:02.740 --> 13:07.161
PUT IT UNDER
THAT PINE TREE BACK THERE, HUH?

13:07.244 --> 13:08.370
- WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.957
- DO WE HAVE TO?

13:12.041 --> 13:14.168
- YOU THINK I'M A SPACE INVADER.
- A WHAT?

13:14.251 --> 13:17.379
- I LEAVE A TOOTHBRUSH
IN YOUR BATHROOM,

13:17.463 --> 13:19.173
AND IT BUGS YOU SO MUCH
THAT YOU RETURN IT TO ME.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.383
TWICE.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.427
IT MAKES ME QUESTION WHERE
THIS RELATIONSHIP IS HEADED.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.887
- WHY DOES IT
HAVE TO GO ANYWHERE?

13:24.970 --> 13:26.222
I LIKE IT WHERE IT IS.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.389
- AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.766
- GOOD. YOU'RE UP.

13:28.849 --> 13:31.852
- OKAY, BUT SEE, THE THING IS

13:31.936 --> 13:34.230
SOMETIMES THERE'S
NOT NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.398
- WHY ARE YOU GETTING
SO WOUND UP OVER A TOOTHBRUSH?

13:36.482 --> 13:37.650
- IT'S NOT ABOUT A TOOTHBRUSH.

13:37.733 --> 13:40.819
IT'S ABOUT
WHAT THE TOOTHBRUSH SYMBOLIZES.

13:40.903 --> 13:43.239
YOU KNOW, I GUESS THERE ARE
JUST TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE.

13:43.322 --> 13:47.243
THE ONES WHO LIKE A RELATIONSHIP
TO BE MOVING FORWARD,

13:47.326 --> 13:49.411
AND THE ONES WHO...

13:49.495 --> 13:51.247
LIKE IT TO STAY IN ONE PLACE.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.290
- MELANIE, IF YOU'RE ASKING
IF I WANT OUR RELATIONSHIP

13:53.374 --> 13:55.584
TO MOVE FORWARD RIGHT NOW,

13:55.668 --> 13:57.086
I GOT TO BE HONEST--

13:57.169 --> 13:58.587
I'M NOT READY FOR THAT.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.923
- OH, OKAY.

14:01.006 --> 14:05.135
THEN, UM...

14:05.219 --> 14:09.098
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE A BREAK
FOR A WHILE.

14:09.181 --> 14:13.310
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.604
- I THINK IT IS.

14:15.688 --> 14:20.985
[sniffles]

14:21.068 --> 14:22.653
- I'D OFFER YOU
A TISSUE RIGHT NOW,

14:22.736 --> 14:26.031
BUT IT'S IN THE TRAVEL CASE
I GOT YOU, SO...

14:26.115 --> 14:27.950
THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.454
- OH, HONEY,
IT'S ALL GONNA BE OKAY.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.291
- NO. WHAT IF I MADE THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE OF MY LIFE?

14:35.374 --> 14:37.126
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PUSHED HIM.

14:37.209 --> 14:39.128
ISN'T GOING SLOW
BETTER THAN NOT GOING AT ALL?

14:39.211 --> 14:41.130
- OH, I'M SORRY, MELANIE.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.007
IT'S HORRIBLE
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

14:43.090 --> 14:48.971
BUT I'M GOING TO LEARN FROM
YOUR AWFUL, AWFUL MISTAKE.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.472
WHEN I SEE EMMET
ON THE SET TOMORROW,

14:50.556 --> 14:52.933
I AM NOT GOING TO BRING UP
OUR RELATIONSHIP AT ALL.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.811
I'M JUST GOING TO DO THE SCENE
AND COME HOME

14:55.894 --> 14:57.980
WITH MY DIGNITY
AND A BOTTLE OF VODKA

14:58.063 --> 15:01.150
AND WATCH THEM BOTH
SLIP AWAY.

15:03.152 --> 15:07.740
- YOU ARE CLEAR ON THE CONCEPT
OF PRIVATE INVESTIGATION?

15:07.823 --> 15:09.491
- I KNOW,
BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.368
THE THREE OF US
ARE A PACKAGE DEAL.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.329
- BUT IF YOU BREAK THIS RULE,
WHAT'S TO STOP YOU

15:13.412 --> 15:17.124
FROM BREAKING THE RULE
ABOUT FALLING IN LOVE WITH ME?

15:18.959 --> 15:21.337
- I'LL STOP AT JUST THIS RULE.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.756
ANY SIGN OF ELKA
ON SURVEILLANCE YET?

15:23.839 --> 15:25.674
- NO. THE SUBJECT
IS STILL LAYING LOW.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.509
- I FEEL WEIRD ABOUT THIS.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.179
I MEAN, ELKA HAS NEVER DONE
ANYTHING REALLY WRONG.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.805
- MELANIE, A YEAR AGO
SHE WAS ARRESTED

15:31.889 --> 15:34.892
FOR HOUSING STOLEN JEWELS
FOR THE MOB.

15:34.975 --> 15:38.395
- YEAH, WELL,
THERE WAS THAT.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.397
- AND IF WE HAD KNOWN ABOUT
THAT AHEAD OF TIME,

15:40.481 --> 15:42.024
WE COULD HAVE KEPT HER
OUT OF TROUBLE.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.652
WHICH IS WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOW.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.321
FOR COLLEGE CREDIT.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.490
- AT LEAST THIS HAS KEPT
MY MIND OFF ALEC.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.367
NO, IT HASN'T.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.869
I WONDER WHAT
HE'S THINKING RIGHT NOW.

15:53.952 --> 15:57.539
HEY, YOU'RE A MAN, RIGHT?

15:57.623 --> 16:00.918
- WELL, I'M GLAD
<i>SOMEONE</i> NOTICED.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.337
MY TAKE--YOU SPOOKED HIM.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.381
I'D BE SURPRISED IF YOU EVER
HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.382
[phone chimes]

16:06.465 --> 16:09.009
- OH! IT'S ALEC.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.470
- I'M SURPRISED.

16:17.101 --> 16:18.727
- HELLO, FUNNY FACE.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.647
- YOU.
YOU'RE HERE.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.358
- THE TEXT YOU GOT FROM GARY
TO MEET HIM ON THE SET

16:24.441 --> 16:25.734
ACTUALLY CAME FROM ME.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.405
- SO THE TEXT
WAS JUST A PRETEXT.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.366
- SIT WITH ME.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.912
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

16:36.995 --> 16:38.872
- WELL, YOU SAID IT WASN'T
GONNA WORK OUT

16:38.956 --> 16:40.290
WITH HARRY AND SYLVIA,

16:40.374 --> 16:42.751
AND CLEARLY YOU'RE HARRY
AND I'M SYLVIA.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.420
- WELL, IT'S TRUE, I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK OUT

16:44.503 --> 16:45.879
FOR HARRY AND SYLVIA.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.048
BUT THEY'RE
WOODY ALLEN CHARACTERS.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.759
THEY'RE NEUROTIC, SELF-CENTERED,
VAIN, DRAMATIC.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.261
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GET
TO THE PART

16:52.344 --> 16:54.221
WHERE THEY'RE NOT LIKE US?

16:54.304 --> 16:56.724
- VICTORIA, OF COURSE YOU AND I
ARE GONNA WORK OUT.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.559
I LOVE YOU.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.061
- OH, AND I LOVE YOU.
BUT WHAT'S NEXT?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.646
WE'VE NEVER DISCUSSED IT.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.647
- WELL, I ASSUMED WE WOULD
WHEN THE MOVIE WRAPPED.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.276
BUT SOMETHING'S COME UP,
SO LET'S DISCUSS IT NOW.

17:08.861 --> 17:09.944
I'VE BEEN OFFERED THE VILLAIN

17:10.028 --> 17:11.655
IN THE NEW JAMES BOND MOVIE.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.949
THREE MONTHS SHOOTING
IN MOROCCO.

17:14.031 --> 17:15.992
COME WITH ME.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.246
- SOMETHING'S HAPPENING.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.707
- YOU FEEL IT TOO?

17:21.790 --> 17:24.460
- ON THE SCREEN.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.962
THAT'S ELKA.

17:27.045 --> 17:29.381
- AND THAT'S MY DAD.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.134
- OKAY. SOMETHING'S UP.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.761
BUT JUST GIVE ME
A COUPLE OF DAYS TO INVESTIGATE

17:33.844 --> 17:34.970
BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.264
- OKAY--
OH, GOD, LOOK AT THIS!

17:41.059 --> 17:42.478
- LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE
A ZOMBIE MOVIE.

17:42.561 --> 17:43.937
- YEAH.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.774
<i>NIGHT OF THE ASSISTED</i>
<i>LIVING DEAD.</i>

17:48.400 --> 17:50.360
- YOU'RE FUNNY.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.071
WHICH CHANGES NOTHING.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.950
- SO WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE SECRECY?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.452
YOUR TEXT SAID
YOU WANTED TO TALK.

17:58.535 --> 17:59.828
- WELL, I THOUGHT IF I TEXTED

17:59.912 --> 18:01.455
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING IN MY BATHROOM,

18:01.538 --> 18:02.790
I MIGHT CREEP YOU OUT.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.334
OKAY. OPEN.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.335
- [gasps]

18:06.418 --> 18:08.462
OH, ALEC.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.339
THIS IS SO SWEET.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.634
- WELL, GOOD.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING FOR.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.969
AND NO TRAVEL KIT.
THIS ALL STAYS RIGHT HERE.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.807
- WHERE DID YOU GET
ALL THIS?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.141
- WELL, I JUST WENT
TO THE STORE

18:21.225 --> 18:24.228
AND I SAID,
"LOAD ME UP ON LADY STUFF."

18:24.311 --> 18:26.522
- "OLAY FACIAL/HAIR REMOVAL
DUO."

18:26.605 --> 18:29.149
MM. YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING?

18:29.233 --> 18:31.276
- I TOLD THE WOMAN AT THE STORE
YOU WERE ITALIAN.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.694
I GUESS SHE MADE ASSUMPTIONS.
I'LL THROW THAT AWAY.

18:32.778 --> 18:37.032
- NO, NO, I'LL THROW IT AWAY.
LATER.

18:37.115 --> 18:39.243
SO WHAT CHANGED
YOUR MIND?

18:39.326 --> 18:41.703
- WELL, AFTER THE GOLF COURSE,
I CAME HOME

18:41.787 --> 18:44.873
AND EVERY ROOM IN THIS HOUSE
REMINDED ME OF YOU.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.208
AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

18:46.291 --> 18:48.502
WHY AM I TRYING
TO KEEP HER STUFF OUT OF HERE?

18:48.585 --> 18:50.754
SHE'S ALREADY HERE AND...

18:50.838 --> 18:53.131
I LIKE IT.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.554
- A KEY?

18:58.637 --> 19:00.264
- I DECIDED THAT...

19:00.347 --> 19:02.391
I'M THE KIND OF PERSON
THAT WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.770
MOVE IN WITH ME?

19:09.815 --> 19:11.775
- CONGRATULATIONS, YOU GUYS.

19:11.859 --> 19:13.569
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M MOVING IN WITH ALEC.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.280
- AND I'M GOING TO MOROCCO
WITH EMMET.

19:16.363 --> 19:20.158
- ALL I KNOW IS YOU'RE LEAVING
ME HERE, ALONE WITH ELKA.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.579
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU GUYS.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.998
BUT THIS IS ALL GOOD,
RIGHT?

19:26.081 --> 19:28.041
I MEAN, WE CAME TO CLEVELAND
TO REINVEST OURSELVES,

19:28.125 --> 19:29.751
AND WE DID.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.253
- IMAGINE WE HADN'T CRASHED HERE

19:31.336 --> 19:33.255
AND OUR FLIGHT HAD TAKEN US
STRAIGHT TO PARIS.

19:33.338 --> 19:35.716
WE WOULD HAVE EATEN
A LOT OF FATTY FRENCH FOOD,

19:35.799 --> 19:37.885
BOUGHT A LOT OF DISCOUNT
CHANEL,

19:37.968 --> 19:40.929
AND THEN FLOWN BACK
TO OUR EMPTY LIVES IN L.A.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.974
[all inhale, exhale]

19:44.057 --> 19:46.184
all: DISCOUNT CHANEL.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.063
- I'LL GRAB ANOTHER BOTTLE.

19:55.485 --> 19:57.613
ELKA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:57.696 --> 19:59.281
- NOTHING.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.824
- WHAT'S IN THERE?

20:00.908 --> 20:02.326
- NOTHING!

20:02.409 --> 20:05.329
- I KNOW
YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING.

20:07.205 --> 20:09.499
OH, MY GOD!

20:11.335 --> 20:13.462
OH, MY GOD!

20:13.545 --> 20:16.798
OH, MY GOD, SO THAT'S
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN SELLING.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.508
AND YOU'VE BEEN HIDING THEM
ALL ALONG

20:18.592 --> 20:21.053
IS THIS OLD-FASHIONED
MICROWAVE THING.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.932
- IT'S AN OVEN.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.644
- THE ONE PLACE
YOU KNEW WE'D NEVER LOOK.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.812
- OKAY, YOU GOT ME.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.065
NOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
