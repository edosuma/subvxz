00:02.750 --> 00:04.166
Are you sure
school is worth all this?

00:04.166 --> 00:06.041
I'm going to graduate,
pass the bar up north

00:06.041 --> 00:07.333
and work in a DA's office

00:07.333 --> 00:09.333
where everybody talks
in flat Yankee vowels.

00:09.333 --> 00:10.625
You're applying
for a scholarship?

00:10.625 --> 00:12.000
I have one now,
for cheerleading.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.500
Cheerleading? Oh.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.542
Hello, Marti.
Welcome to Cheertown.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.333
I need two pre-law students
to help me.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.500
A man been has
been sentenced
to life in prison

00:19.500 --> 00:20.875
for a minor burglary.

00:20.875 --> 00:23.000
I took this case
to get a law overturned.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.583
If there's even the slightest
chance that he's innocent--

00:24.583 --> 00:27.000
If you pass the bar one day,
you take up his cause.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.333
Why wait till then?

00:28.333 --> 00:29.708
Professor showed up here
about an hour ago

00:29.708 --> 00:31.166
and asked me all about
the investigator reports

00:31.166 --> 00:32.250
you had me request.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.500
He knows. He knows everything.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.959
I covered for you,
but y'all need to be

00:34.959 --> 00:36.209
a lot more careful than that.

00:36.209 --> 00:38.000
We need to talk
about what happened.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.750
(Marti)
Nothing happened.
You're dating my roommate.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.166
I'm not gonna let
a stupid mistake hurt her.

00:42.166 --> 00:45.166
Well, it didn't feel
like a mistake to me.

Yeah. Yeah,
you could say that.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.084
You wanna talk about it?

02:48.084 --> 02:52.209

It's okay.

Have you seen
my blue-striped tie?

03:02.875 --> 03:05.792
I put it
in the dry cleaning pile.

03:06.917 --> 03:09.041
Oh. Why would you do that?

Hey, let's go grab breakfast
like we used to.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.750
I can't,
I actually have to go in early

03:27.750 --> 03:31.250
to check on some lab results
in my wrinkled tie.

03:31.250 --> 03:34.209
- Why did I ask?
- Come on, Vanessa.

03:34.209 --> 03:37.209
It's football season.
You know work is crazy.

03:37.209 --> 03:39.167
Well, I miss my boyfriend.

03:39.167 --> 03:40.583
You canceled
the last two date nights.

03:40.583 --> 03:43.542
You're always off
at away games every
other weekend.

03:43.542 --> 03:44.875
Yeah, but this promotion comes

03:44.875 --> 03:46.834
with a lot of responsibility,
right?

03:46.834 --> 03:49.041
And right now it has to be
the focus of my life.

03:50.291 --> 03:52.084
You said that last month.

03:52.084 --> 03:53.583
You said
things were gonna calm down.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.208

03:57.125 --> 03:59.167

03:59.167 --> 04:01.250
Okay, what do you want me
to say here, Vanessa?

04:04.458 --> 04:06.000
Did I do something, Derrick?

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
I mean, do you not
think about us anymore?

04:10.000 --> 04:11.875
You know
this is really unfair, right

04:11.875 --> 04:13.083
to do this to me
when I'm in such a hurry?

04:13.083 --> 04:15.041
I know, we just used
to talk about our future.

04:15.041 --> 04:17.250
We used to talk about marriage

04:17.250 --> 04:20.083
where you were gonna take me
on our honeymoon.

04:20.083 --> 04:22.333
Been a long time
since we've had
one of those talks.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.042
Because I don't have time
to think about

04:24.042 --> 04:26.083
anything else besides work,
Vanessa.

04:26.083 --> 04:29.208
And when I took this job,
we both understood that.

04:29.208 --> 04:33.209
I seem to remember you making
the decision to take the job.

04:38.042 --> 04:39.959

throw that in my face?

Just so you know,
we're all behind you 100%.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.333
What are you talking about?

05:47.333 --> 05:50.208
Um, okay.

05:50.208 --> 05:53.041
Have you checked
your e-mail, phone?

05:53.041 --> 05:56.458
- No.
- Wow, this is really awkward.

05:58.084 --> 06:00.208
What the hell is going on?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.583
There were some photographs.

06:03.583 --> 06:06.209
Alice, honey,
come into my office.

06:24.042 --> 06:25.125
Where did these end up?

06:25.125 --> 06:29.000
A bunch of campus e-mails,
100 or so.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.583
The university is holding
a full investigation.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.959
There are six images total.

06:33.959 --> 06:35.000
You wanna see them?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.834
I was there
when they were taken.

06:36.834 --> 06:41.000
- I don't need to see them.
- Can I ask you a question?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.834
What the hell
were you thinking?

06:42.834 --> 06:45.125
I sent these to Jake
a few weeks ago.

06:46.959 --> 06:48.542
He was in Dallas
at an away game.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.834
Look, I certainly didn't know
he was gonna do this

06:50.834 --> 06:52.583
so please

06:52.583 --> 06:54.708
wipe that judgmental,
pitying frown off your face.

06:54.708 --> 06:56.083
Don't get defensive.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.291
Strong, smart,
independent women can
do some stupid things.

06:58.291 --> 07:00.708
I know I have
and I'm not even that smart.

07:00.708 --> 07:03.375
I'm drowning
in sisterhood here.

07:03.375 --> 07:04.500
Do you have a point?

07:04.500 --> 07:07.041
Uh, my point is
this isn't the first time

07:07.041 --> 07:10.167
that you've done
self-destructive
things, Alice.

07:10.167 --> 07:12.000
I'm concerned
that there's a deeper issue.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.417
Deeper issue?
Please, they're just pictures.

07:15.417 --> 07:19.167
- That you're naked in.
- I'm not ashamed of my body.

07:19.167 --> 07:20.959
I look fantastic
in those pictures.

07:20.959 --> 07:23.209
Well, these pictures
don't just go away

07:23.209 --> 07:24.917
not nowadays.

07:24.917 --> 07:27.000
This could affect your future.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.250
I mean, if you're
applying for a job--

07:28.250 --> 07:30.000
It's not that big of a deal.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.458
It's, it's actually
kind of funny.

07:34.917 --> 07:37.084
You really believe that?

07:39.000 --> 07:40.667
I wanna help you,
but if you don't wanna

07:40.667 --> 07:42.875
examine your behavior
and make some changes

07:42.875 --> 07:45.291
then this conversation
is useless.

07:45.291 --> 07:47.792
Finally something
we can agree on.

07:47.792 --> 07:49.250
Are we done?

07:51.084 --> 07:53.000
You know,
I wish that I had someone

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
to talk to when
I was your age.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.417
I might have made
some different choices.

07:58.625 --> 08:00.625
My door's always open.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.750
Thanks

08:02.750 --> 08:04.792
but I don't need a mentor.

08:11.625 --> 08:15.000
Alice. Hey, Alice. Alice.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.834
- What?
- Did Jake do this?

08:16.834 --> 08:19.250
- Who else?
- Oh.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.792
You're gonna go
kick the crap out of him?

08:20.792 --> 08:23.542
There are naked pictures of me
up all over campus.

08:23.542 --> 08:27.042
I'm humiliated.
What do you think?

08:27.042 --> 08:29.125
I think
you might want some help.

08:31.209 --> 08:32.500
Really?

08:33.667 --> 08:35.000
If you want.

08:37.792 --> 08:40.042
Thank you. I...

08:40.042 --> 08:42.332
[sniffles]
It just means a lot.
That's all.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.458
I came over
as soon as I got your message.

08:52.125 --> 08:54.084
What's, what's going on?

08:54.084 --> 08:55.542
Well, it's come
to my attention

08:55.542 --> 08:58.083
that the two of you
have been sneaking
around behind my back.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.291
Don't glower at me.
I didn't tell him.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.542
Been throwing my name around,
harassing people?

09:04.542 --> 09:06.084
Did you really think
it wouldn't get back to me?

09:06.084 --> 09:08.792
A-all we did
was knock on a few doors.

09:08.792 --> 09:09.875
And it was for a good cause.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.000
Do you have any idea

09:11.000 --> 09:13.125
the mess you've created?

09:13.125 --> 09:14.792
Mr. Overton
has contacted the school.

09:14.792 --> 09:17.834
He's considering legal action
against us for harassment.

09:17.834 --> 09:20.708
[scoffs]
We visited his store
during business hours

09:20.708 --> 09:22.000
and asked a few questions.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.625
- He has no case.
- He's a booster.

09:24.625 --> 09:26.458
He gives money
to this university.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.041
Do I really
have to draw you a map?

09:28.041 --> 09:30.291
Both our laptops
disappeared from our dorms

09:30.291 --> 09:31.750
and it, it was right after
we confronted Overton

09:31.750 --> 09:33.542
which is more
than a little suspicious.

09:33.542 --> 09:37.167
Do you have anything that's
admissible in a court of law?

09:37.167 --> 09:40.583
Anything that's not conjecture
or hearsay

09:40.583 --> 09:42.458
or magical thinking?

09:42.458 --> 09:44.667
Okay, for the sake of argument

09:44.667 --> 09:47.417
let's just assume that you
did have irrefutable evidence.

09:47.417 --> 09:49.209
What then?

09:49.209 --> 09:50.959
You help one person.

09:50.959 --> 09:52.291
'What I'm trying to do'

09:52.291 --> 09:54.708
repeal Tennessee's
three-strikes law,
could help hundreds.

09:54.708 --> 09:57.875
But we've been
over this before,
right, Marti?

09:59.208 --> 10:00.834
- Yeah.
- 'Look.'

10:00.834 --> 10:04.000
I understand
the emotional pull
of an underdog.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.875
Hurricane Carter rescued
from an unjust prison sentence

10:07.875 --> 10:09.291
by plucky Canadian amateurs.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.458
It's a fabulous story,
ready-made for Hollywood

10:11.458 --> 10:13.458
but that kind of glamorization

10:13.458 --> 10:15.375
of the legal profession
is dangerous.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.417
'It leads to arrogance
and self-promotion'

10:17.417 --> 10:20.750
and it gets in the way
of the real work.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.917
In a learning environment,
there's simply no place for it

10:22.917 --> 10:25.792
except as a cautionary tale
for other students.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.583
- A cautionary tale?
- Julian, please.

10:28.583 --> 10:31.458
You both are off
three-strikes
project, alright?

10:31.458 --> 10:34.000
- What?
- Travis Guthrie is my client.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.667
You contact him again

10:35.667 --> 10:38.959
and I will go to great pains
to make sure you regret it.

10:42.959 --> 10:44.208
Oh, my...

10:48.125 --> 10:49.667
- What is wrong with you?
- Okay.

10:49.667 --> 10:51.166
First off,
I didn't send
the pictures.

10:51.166 --> 10:52.875
- Secondly--
- You expect us
to believe that?

10:52.875 --> 10:55.125
Secondly, you better let go
before you go to the hospital

10:55.125 --> 10:58.083
and my team goes to jail
for putting you there.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.125
- Somebody stole my phone.
- Seriously?

11:02.125 --> 11:05.125
- Yeah, seriously.
- Really? Yeah.

11:05.125 --> 11:06.917
Let him go.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.333
- Well, thanks, fellas.
- Yeah.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.500
- We're good here.
- Thanks. Yeah.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.333
Okay, none of
the guys wanted to be
the one to tell me

11:19.333 --> 11:21.000
so I only found out about it
an hour ago

11:21.000 --> 11:24.042
when campus security came by
to interrogate me.

11:24.042 --> 11:26.542
You don't believe me, ask 'em.

11:26.542 --> 11:30.125
So we're looking for whoever
stole your phone. Any ideas?

11:30.125 --> 11:31.375
It was in my locker
during practice

11:31.375 --> 11:33.209
and after I showered,
it was gone.

11:33.209 --> 11:35.625
Who would do that?

11:35.625 --> 11:37.834
I got a theory.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.083
Come on.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.083
How am I supposed
to help Travis if
I can't even speak to him?

11:45.083 --> 11:47.333
I-if Julian finds out
I'm visiting Travis...

11:47.333 --> 11:51.209
[sighs]
I mean, he's already kicked me
off the three-strikes clinic.

11:51.209 --> 11:53.042
And the only thing
left for him to do
is to flunk me

11:53.042 --> 11:55.000
from the class
I'm taking with him.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.583
Well, I can't risk it.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.333
There's no other choice here,
right?

12:00.250 --> 12:02.167
- You're not paying attention.
- I'm sorry.

12:02.167 --> 12:04.208
I'm preoccupied.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.583
A furrowed brow.
That's a new look for you.

12:08.375 --> 12:10.125
Doesn't it bother you, M?

12:10.125 --> 12:11.750
Less than a week ago

12:11.750 --> 12:13.209
you and I are in the back
of your mom's car

12:13.209 --> 12:14.458
trying to tear
each other's clothes--

12:14.458 --> 12:16.583
- Okay, we agreed to move on.
- I know, I know.

12:16.583 --> 12:20.625
But saying it and doing it are
two totally different things.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.834
This playacting,
it's just,

12:22.834 --> 12:24.166
it's not sittin'
right with me.

12:24.166 --> 12:26.375
Dan, you care
about Savannah.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.625
I've seen
how you are with her.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.333
You've never been that happy
about anybody else.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.667
Well, that's why
this is so confusing to me.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.333
I made an explicit promise
to be exclusive.

12:35.333 --> 12:38.333
I mean, I take
a broken promise
very seriously.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.208
Yeah, we're human.
We make mistakes.

12:41.208 --> 12:43.875
We move on and try
to do better next time

12:43.875 --> 12:45.959
because we have to.

12:45.959 --> 12:48.458
- This is that easy for you?
- Of course, it's not easy.

12:48.458 --> 12:52.375
I'm as freaked out as you are,
but it-it's like the flu.

12:52.375 --> 12:53.667
We'll feel bad for a week
and then

12:53.667 --> 12:56.500
everything will go back
to normal.

12:56.500 --> 13:01.000
- I hope you're right.
- I am. You'll see.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.458
Hey, guys.
Sorry, I had trouble
exchanging a textbook.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.792
Everything okay?

13:09.708 --> 13:12.750
Right as rain.
Just like always.

13:14.042 --> 13:15.250
Oh, you're coming, Marti?

13:15.250 --> 13:16.583
Why don't you guys
go up ahead?

13:16.583 --> 13:19.333
I'm gonna grab
a cup of coffee.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.542
- Shall we?
- We shall.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.583
♪ Oh who's alone? ♪

13:35.084 --> 13:36.792
Oh! Ow, ow!

13:38.166 --> 13:39.708
Great.

13:45.167 --> 13:46.959
You're havin' a rough day?

13:48.500 --> 13:51.417
- Shaping up that way.
- I guess.

13:51.417 --> 13:53.041
Well, how about
I buy you a replacement

13:53.041 --> 13:55.708
and you can tell me
all about it?

13:55.708 --> 13:57.125
I'm thinkin' decaf though.

13:57.125 --> 13:58.667
[chuckles]

14:00.000 --> 14:02.250
(Vanessa)
'These pictures
are serious business'

14:02.250 --> 14:03.875
and Alice just laughed it off.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.208
[chuckles]
She's a tough little thing

14:06.208 --> 14:08.792
but, uh maybe she's just
coverin' up.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.084
Oh, who can say?

14:10.084 --> 14:12.667
I wanted to get
through to her,
but she's so guarded.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.042
I just want her to understand
that the stupid choices

14:15.042 --> 14:16.542
that you make
when you're a kid

14:16.542 --> 14:18.084
can follow you around
for years.

14:18.084 --> 14:20.375
[laughs]
You and I are proof
positive for that.

14:20.375 --> 14:22.667
[laughs]
Amen.

14:22.667 --> 14:24.417
You know, all you can do
is be there for her.

14:24.417 --> 14:26.250
[chuckles]
I've watched
more than a couple of kids

14:26.250 --> 14:28.000
throw away their talents
with some bad decisions.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.041
Well, what'd you do?

14:29.041 --> 14:30.834
I tried to help

14:30.834 --> 14:32.000
but you can only
open the door.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.417
You can't make 'em
walk through it.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.542
You ask me, that's the hardest
thing about teaching

14:36.542 --> 14:38.667
the frustration, you know,
that you can't do more.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.834
Well, most days,
it's the best job in the world

14:40.834 --> 14:43.834
but today, ugh!
I just wanna scream
at the girl.

14:43.834 --> 14:46.042
You know, just wake her up.

14:46.042 --> 14:50.041
I swear, between Alice and
the morning I just had, I'm--

14:50.041 --> 14:51.792
What happened this morning?

14:53.209 --> 14:54.792
Mm. No.

14:54.792 --> 14:57.209
I had a fight with Derrick,
but we're not
talking about it.

14:57.209 --> 14:58.041
It's off-limits.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.000
Fair enough,
but I can imagine.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.084
I mean,
Derrick and I work together.

15:02.084 --> 15:04.333
I'm seein' the toll
the job's taking on the man.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.458
Mm, I see
what you're doing there.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.917
Yeah, you're trying
to dangle inside information

15:08.917 --> 15:11.708
to get me talking.
It's not gonna happen.

15:11.708 --> 15:14.333
- No? Am I that transparent?
- Like liquid soap.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.458
Oh. That's good.
I'm gonna write that down.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.041
[laughing]

15:18.041 --> 15:19.750
Anyway, you were,
uh, telling me

15:19.750 --> 15:21.208
about the fight
you had with Derrick.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.834
Okay, now,
now you're just
being lazy.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.458
[laughs]
Alright, you know what?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.084
[clears throat]

15:27.084 --> 15:29.917
Crisp $1 bill

15:29.917 --> 15:31.000
could be all yours

15:31.000 --> 15:33.042
if you tell me about the fight
you had with your boyfriend.

15:33.042 --> 15:35.834
Oh, my private life
doesn't come cheap.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.625
Oh? Good.
I got a counter offer?

15:38.625 --> 15:40.792
- Let me see the wristwatch.
- This? It's a knockoff.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.917
- I'll be the judge of that.
- No.

15:42.917 --> 15:44.125
It says Molex
right on the face.

15:44.125 --> 15:46.167
No, it doesn't! It does...

15:48.959 --> 15:50.209
Uh...

15:51.417 --> 15:53.959
I should get back to work.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.083
Vanessa,
nothing's happening here.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.917
Uh, can you
just leave, please?

16:17.542 --> 16:19.084
How can you be so sure
it was Damian?

16:19.084 --> 16:21.250
'Cause he used to pull
this kinda crap all the time

16:21.250 --> 16:22.708
even when I was on the team.

16:22.708 --> 16:25.042
Uh, watches, phones, cash.

16:25.042 --> 16:27.166
They disappear
when Damian doesn't like you.

16:27.166 --> 16:28.917
And he keeps
getting away with it?

16:28.917 --> 16:30.917
Yeah, he's one of the best
players on the team, so...

16:30.917 --> 16:33.834
- But you guys
are buddy-buddy.
- 'No, they're not.'

16:33.834 --> 16:36.041
Jake and Damian
got into a fight last week.

16:36.041 --> 16:38.375
Heard about it
all the way down
at the film room.

16:38.375 --> 16:39.542
About what?

16:39.542 --> 16:40.875
He was half-assin' it
in practice

16:40.875 --> 16:42.166
and I called him out on it.

16:42.166 --> 16:45.000
It escalated. Wait here.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.291
Hey, buddy.

16:54.291 --> 16:56.042
Hey, Jake. What's up?

16:59.542 --> 17:02.125
You wanna open that locker
back up for us?

17:02.125 --> 17:04.000
Uh, you wanna smell
my dirty socks?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.458
No, really. Open the locker.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.000
[scoffs]

17:08.000 --> 17:10.125
Will it help if I say
pretty please?

17:16.750 --> 17:19.084
You know,
you have no right to do this.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.500
- Is this yours?
- Yep.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.875
Hey, man, that's your phone?

17:25.875 --> 17:27.166
I found it on our bench,
like, ten minutes ago.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.290
I was actually
about to run it down

17:28.290 --> 17:29.834
to the Lost And Found.

17:29.834 --> 17:31.041
You think the guy
who really sent

17:31.041 --> 17:33.166
those pictures
might have ditched it here?

17:33.166 --> 17:35.042
- 'Nobody's gonna
believe that.'
- Of course, they will.

17:35.042 --> 17:37.542
- I'm a freakin'
football star.
- That doesn't matter.

17:37.542 --> 17:38.917
What do you think, Jakey?

17:38.917 --> 17:41.166
Do football players
pay for their crimes?

17:43.083 --> 17:44.625
He's right.

17:44.625 --> 17:47.500
Look, if you guys
wanna make an issue about this

17:47.500 --> 17:49.250
I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.167
Okay, Bill Marsh
is gonna make sure

17:51.167 --> 17:53.667
that the story's all about
some slutty cheerleader

17:53.667 --> 17:55.583
who took dirty photos
of herself.

17:55.583 --> 17:58.209
- And that bitch--
- Bitch?

17:58.209 --> 18:01.041
Who hijacked the magazine
article for "Fotogem"

18:01.041 --> 18:05.125
an article, by the way,
that I was supposed
to be featured in

18:05.125 --> 18:07.125
he'll ruin her.

18:11.209 --> 18:13.875
Oh, Alice, uh,
are the boobs real?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.500
'Couple of the guys,
we just have a bet goin' on.'

18:15.500 --> 18:17.209
They really
are somethin'.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.875
Is there a problem here?

18:21.875 --> 18:24.000
Just boys being boys.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.084
(Red)
'Well, then perhaps
those boys should walk away'

18:26.084 --> 18:28.125
from each other
right now

18:28.125 --> 18:30.208
before I start
asking questions.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.917
Save it.

18:42.458 --> 18:44.000
A moment.

18:48.041 --> 18:50.083
I'm real sorry about
what happened to you.

18:50.083 --> 18:53.834
It was nothing.
It was, it was kinda funny.

18:53.834 --> 18:56.542
Anyway, a, a word to the wise.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.583
You have a real friend
in Vanessa.

18:58.583 --> 19:01.041
She's hurtin'
right along with you.

19:01.041 --> 19:03.583
Don't be scared
to open up to her.

19:03.583 --> 19:06.375
I'm sorry.
Who elected you dad?

19:06.375 --> 19:08.000
I rule by fiat.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.125
Now get your two X chromosomes
out of my locker room.

19:11.125 --> 19:12.166
Scoot.

19:14.625 --> 19:18.125
(Savannah)
'One, two, three, four,
five, six.'

19:18.125 --> 19:19.917
- It's, it's
a ball change, so--
- Ball what?

19:19.917 --> 19:21.250
- Ball change.
- Ball, ball what?

19:21.250 --> 19:23.291
It's a, it's a ball change.
It's a step, step.

19:23.291 --> 19:25.834
- So it's like a step, step.
- Step, step?

19:25.834 --> 19:29.000
Okay, yeah, but on your toes.
So step, step.

19:31.291 --> 19:33.000
Yeah. No, okay. Okay.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.750
You know,
you just need to relax, okay?

19:34.750 --> 19:36.375
You can't groove
unless you're breathing.

19:36.375 --> 19:38.166
So breathe.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.750
'Alright.
Okay, let's try it at 40%.'

19:40.750 --> 19:42.708
'Let's get the music
in your body, alright?'

19:42.708 --> 19:44.375
Come on. We can do this. Yeah.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.750
Five, six, seven, eight.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.084
One, two, three, four

19:49.084 --> 19:51.583
five, six, seven, eight.

19:51.583 --> 19:53.417
- Oh!
- Oh.

19:53.417 --> 19:54.542
[groans]

19:54.542 --> 19:56.708
Ok, let's take five. Alright?

19:56.708 --> 19:58.875
Excuse me,
do we really have to video me

19:58.875 --> 20:00.250
messing up every step?

20:00.250 --> 20:02.375
[sighs]
You'll thank me
ten years from now

20:02.375 --> 20:05.084
when you have
a record of all
the hard work you've put in.

20:05.792 --> 20:07.000
Hey, she's comin'.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.542
Oh, Derrick,
get-get out of sight.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.084
'Go. Go.'

20:13.125 --> 20:15.875
Vanessa, hey, I need
to ask you something.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.500
'Um, okay,
I'm going over stuff
for sectionals'

20:17.500 --> 20:19.000
and I'm kind
of confused, okay?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.458
(Derrick)
'What do you think
the chances are'

20:20.458 --> 20:22.500
of me getting out of this
with my dignity intact?

20:22.500 --> 20:25.542
- Oh, slim to none.
- Yeah. That sounds
about right.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.084
[laughing]

20:27.084 --> 20:29.750
But, hey, listen.
I really do appreciate
you guys.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.834
I mean, doin' all this
on such short notice.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.708
Hey, it's
our collective pleasure.

20:33.708 --> 20:35.875
Yeah.

20:35.875 --> 20:39.083
Hey, w-when did you know
Vanessa was the one?

20:39.083 --> 20:45.208
Oh. Um, about six weeks or so
after our first date.

20:45.208 --> 20:46.834
- Huh.
- Yeah.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.667
Were you ever confused?

20:48.667 --> 20:49.834
I mean, you,
you ever doubt it?

20:49.834 --> 20:53.417
[sighs]
You're always confused, Dan

20:53.417 --> 20:55.208
and you always have doubts.

20:55.208 --> 20:58.209
It's just human nature.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.000
[sighs]
So now why do you ask?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.500
Are things startin' to get
pretty serious

21:02.500 --> 21:04.209
with you and Savannah?

21:04.209 --> 21:06.209
Things are gettin' serious.

21:06.209 --> 21:07.291
Yeah.

21:07.291 --> 21:09.500
And so are the doubts.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.500
Hm.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.333
You're a very lucky guy, Dan.

21:13.333 --> 21:16.125
A girl like Savannah
doesn't come along often.

21:16.125 --> 21:18.834
She is perhaps
the most genuinely kindhearted

21:18.834 --> 21:21.000
and loyal person
that I have ever met.

21:23.084 --> 21:25.458
Yeah, that she is.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.708
Now even
if you could prove it,
you're not underage

21:36.708 --> 21:38.750
so none of Tennessee's
sexting laws apply.

21:38.750 --> 21:41.209
- You're kidding.
- I'm not.

21:41.209 --> 21:42.667
Okay, what about
the pictures themselves?

21:42.667 --> 21:44.750
Yeah, are they not
Alice's property?

21:44.750 --> 21:47.084
They are, but you'd
have to prove that
Damian sent them out

21:47.084 --> 21:49.084
and since they came off
of Jake's phone...

21:49.084 --> 21:51.291
So that's it?
There's nothing that I can do.

21:51.291 --> 21:53.417
My advice would be
to file a police report

21:53.417 --> 21:55.125
and they probably won't arrest
him, but they'll at least

21:55.125 --> 21:56.750
question him
and scare the crap out of him.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.333
It's not enough.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.708
You didn't see
the smug look on his face.

22:00.708 --> 22:03.166
He wasn't sorry. He was proud.

22:03.166 --> 22:05.000
Proud that there are
naked pictures of me out there

22:05.000 --> 22:07.125
for everyone to see forever.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.875
Sometimes the law's limited.
I'm sorry, Alice.

22:09.875 --> 22:12.166
[scoffs]
Don't tell me
you're sorry, Marti.

22:12.166 --> 22:13.959
Come on, Alice.
She's just tryin' to help out.

22:13.959 --> 22:17.208
No, she is studying
to be a lawyer.

22:17.208 --> 22:19.125
She's trying to be
a part of the system

22:19.125 --> 22:21.583
that only seems to be good
at screwing over the innocent

22:21.583 --> 22:23.834
and protecting the guilty.

22:23.834 --> 22:25.458
It sucks, okay?

22:25.458 --> 22:27.792
I've got an innocent guy
rotting in prison right now

22:27.792 --> 22:29.166
and I can't help him either.

22:29.166 --> 22:32.500
Sounds like
a big, fat excuse to me.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.917
It is not that simple, Alice.

22:34.917 --> 22:36.375
Uh, yes, it is.

22:36.375 --> 22:39.041
If it's the right thing to do,
do it.

22:39.041 --> 22:41.083
Make your own justice.

22:44.291 --> 22:46.500
Hey, Alice.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.750
Yes, Darwin?

22:47.750 --> 22:49.333
I feel awful
about what happened.

22:49.333 --> 22:52.250
If one more person tries
to pity me, I will punch them.

22:52.250 --> 22:55.291
- Do you wanna
be punched by me?
- No.

22:55.291 --> 22:58.792
Listen, I know somethin'
about the guy who did it.

22:58.792 --> 23:00.333
Damian.

23:00.333 --> 23:03.250
Somethin' not
a lot of people know.

23:03.250 --> 23:06.750
- You've got my attention.
- Well, it was last semester.

23:06.750 --> 23:10.042
[guitar music]

23:11.041 --> 23:13.542
So what made you
change your mind?

23:15.209 --> 23:17.875
Talked to a friend of mine.

23:17.875 --> 23:20.166
More of
an acquaintance, really.

23:20.166 --> 23:23.750
Actually, she's kind
of a pain in the ass

23:23.750 --> 23:25.291
but she was right.

23:25.291 --> 23:27.625
Helping you
is the right thing to do.

23:27.625 --> 23:30.125
So here I am.

23:30.125 --> 23:33.792
- Here you are.
- I gotta be careful though.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.458
I'm gonna have
a bitch of a time
getting into law school

23:35.458 --> 23:36.583
if Julian flunks me.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.125
[doorbell buzzes]

23:39.667 --> 23:41.209
Miss Perkins.

23:42.959 --> 23:44.167
How did you know I was here?

23:44.167 --> 23:46.291
Oh, my eyes are everywhere.

23:46.291 --> 23:49.041
You know, I seem to remember
kicking you off this project.

23:49.041 --> 23:50.291
'Did you go selectively deaf'

23:50.291 --> 23:51.875
during that part
of our conversation?

23:51.875 --> 23:53.500
Knock it off, counselor,
you're fired.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.084
- Travis, don't.
- No, I've had enough.

23:56.084 --> 23:57.291
He acts like he owns us.

23:57.291 --> 24:00.208
Now you work
for me and I say
she remains on my case

24:00.208 --> 24:02.375
or I stop talking,
I stop cooperating

24:02.375 --> 24:04.125
and you can find
another guinea pig

24:04.125 --> 24:05.875
for your little
three-strikes crusade.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.333
You're threatening me?

24:07.333 --> 24:08.458
[laughs]

24:08.458 --> 24:09.917
(Julian)
'That must feel
very empowering'

24:09.917 --> 24:12.000
to a man in your position.

24:13.333 --> 24:15.417
Well, I accept.

24:15.417 --> 24:18.042
- Excuse me?
- I've been terminated.

24:18.042 --> 24:20.250
I will find someone else
to build my case around.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.125
Good luck, Miss Perkins.
He's your responsibility now.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.417
Now wait,
hold on a minute now.

24:24.417 --> 24:27.291
Of course, as you're not
actually a member of the bar

24:27.291 --> 24:30.542
you can't file briefs
or make motions.

24:30.542 --> 24:34.000
So I would suggest that you
find yourself a good lawyer.

24:48.834 --> 24:51.708
Miss Perkins,
how's your client?

24:51.708 --> 24:55.125
I assume the conversation
after I left was spirited.

24:55.125 --> 24:57.291
It sucked. Thank you.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.750
I'm dropping your class.
I need your signature.

25:02.750 --> 25:05.333
To be clear, I bounced you
from the three-strikes project

25:05.333 --> 25:07.667
but you're welcome to continue
attending my regular class.

25:07.667 --> 25:09.834
Otherwise you've wasted
half a semester of work.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.083
Being taught by you?

25:11.083 --> 25:13.667
Yeah, I already consider
that time wasted.

25:13.667 --> 25:16.209
Time to cut bait.

25:16.209 --> 25:17.834
You might wanna
watch your tone

25:17.834 --> 25:20.125
given you can't
drop the course
without my signature.

25:20.125 --> 25:23.000
What you are doing
to Travis is evil.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.125
You've placed
the cause

25:24.125 --> 25:25.041
over the welfare
of the client.

25:25.041 --> 25:28.083
- It's his cause.
- No. It's your cause.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.084
[chuckles]
What I'm doing--

25:30.084 --> 25:32.667
'Can help hundreds of people
potentially.'

25:32.667 --> 25:35.291
I've heard your argument
and I choose to reject it.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.166
Miss Perkins, Marti

25:40.166 --> 25:42.166
I have reviewed the case.

25:42.166 --> 25:44.125
The state
has a reliable eyewitness

25:44.125 --> 25:46.792
placing Travis at the scene
committing the crime.

25:46.792 --> 25:48.333
The eyewitness lied.

25:48.333 --> 25:51.125
If two idiot college kids
can figure that out

25:51.125 --> 25:52.291
imagine what
a determined lawyer

25:52.291 --> 25:55.042
such as yourself
could accomplish.

25:55.042 --> 25:57.875
You're far from an idiot

25:57.875 --> 26:00.291
but I'm not sure you're cut
out to be a lawyer either.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.209
Better I know that now.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.792
You know why I signed up
for your clinic?

26:14.458 --> 26:16.167
'Cause I wanted
to learn from the lawyer

26:16.167 --> 26:17.500
who was arrested
for contempt of court

26:17.500 --> 26:19.250
when he thought
the judge wasn't listening

26:19.250 --> 26:21.250
and wouldn't stop shouting.

26:21.250 --> 26:24.250
Who waited all night
outside the house
of an appellate judge

26:24.250 --> 26:28.125
just so he could
plead with him to
re-examine a case.

26:28.125 --> 26:30.417
Who chained himself
to a courthouse

26:30.417 --> 26:32.542
to raise awareness about how
his, his client

26:32.542 --> 26:34.875
was being
mistreated in prison.

26:37.209 --> 26:39.417
That is who
I wanted to learn from.

26:40.875 --> 26:43.167
Where is that guy?

26:43.167 --> 26:44.917
You wanna know
what all that effort

26:44.917 --> 26:48.708
and all those years
of hard work and sweat got me?

26:48.708 --> 26:52.125
Two people out of jail,
two in fifteen years.

26:52.125 --> 26:55.208
You have no idea
how frustrating that is.

26:55.208 --> 26:58.000
You can't tear down
The Great Wall

26:58.000 --> 27:01.208
with a hammer and a chisel.

27:01.208 --> 27:03.625
I know. I've tried.

27:03.625 --> 27:07.208
A lawyer has to accept
whatever small moral victories

27:07.208 --> 27:12.625
he can eke out
or else stop caring so much.

27:12.625 --> 27:15.166
See, that's not a lesson
I'm interested in learning.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.000
(Damian)
Here it is.
Here it is. Here it is.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.959
[all cheering]

27:27.959 --> 27:29.792
Oh, my God!

27:29.792 --> 27:31.084
That was the one.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.708
Oh, that was sick.

27:34.667 --> 27:35.792
He's gay.

27:35.792 --> 27:38.667
[chuckles]
Who's gay?

27:38.667 --> 27:41.375
Damian, the enemy.

27:41.375 --> 27:44.333
- Okay.
- No way.

27:44.333 --> 27:46.041
That or he's a straight guy

27:46.041 --> 27:48.041
'that likes to hook up
with dudes.'

27:48.041 --> 27:50.583
Either way,
doesn't matter to me.

27:50.583 --> 27:53.792
- Who told you that?
- Darwin.

27:53.792 --> 27:56.250
He and Damian hooked up
at a party last semester.

27:59.834 --> 28:01.208
[laughs]

28:01.208 --> 28:02.375
- Wow!
- Oh, man.

28:02.375 --> 28:04.792
No, you can't out him.
Unh-unh.

28:04.792 --> 28:07.375
I'm gonna do to him
what he did to me.

28:07.375 --> 28:10.375
Make something public
he doesn't want anyone to see.

28:10.375 --> 28:13.167
No, see, you're violating
his privacy, Alice.

28:13.167 --> 28:14.333
He gave up that right
when he e-mailed

28:14.333 --> 28:16.000
naked pictures of me
to the world.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.208
Yeah, granted,
but in this case

28:17.208 --> 28:19.625
the punishment
doesn't exactly
fit the crime.

28:21.375 --> 28:23.750
Whose side are you on?

28:23.750 --> 28:26.125
Look, Damian is
more than good
at football. Okay?

28:26.125 --> 28:29.125
He's one of
the few guys at Lancer
who'll actually go pro.

28:29.125 --> 28:30.291
And?

28:30.291 --> 28:33.083
And no NFL athlete
has ever come out
publicly while playing.

28:33.083 --> 28:36.125
It-it's stupid,
but it's the way it is.

28:36.125 --> 28:37.708
- Not my problem.
- Alice.

28:37.708 --> 28:39.375
There are a lot
of unwritten
rules in football

28:39.375 --> 28:41.209
okay, especially
in the deep south.

28:41.209 --> 28:44.250
You out him,
it'll destroy
his career.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.500
He doesn't deserve that.

28:45.500 --> 28:47.084
He deserves to be punished

28:47.084 --> 28:48.000
for what he did.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.083
You are the two guys

28:49.083 --> 28:50.583
who were supposed
to have my back.

28:50.583 --> 28:52.166
- 'Instead, you've got his.'
- No.

28:52.166 --> 28:55.333
Look, Alice,
I-I'm tryin' to do
what's right here, okay?

28:55.333 --> 28:57.000
Screw you, Jake.

29:05.084 --> 29:07.959
Let's go. Study table,
ten minutes. Come on. Come on.

29:07.959 --> 29:09.875
[indistinct chatter]

29:55.875 --> 29:57.667
[Red clears throat]
I hate to disappoint you

29:57.667 --> 30:00.834
but your boyfriend's still
finishin' up from practice.

30:00.834 --> 30:03.291
But this isn't
Jake's dorm room, is it?

30:05.083 --> 30:07.917
This is Damian,
wide receiver.

30:09.209 --> 30:11.250
You stole his key,
didn't you?

30:13.000 --> 30:15.167
Oh, look at this. Webcam.

30:16.333 --> 30:18.000
You think you could take
some home videos?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.458
How much trouble am I in?

30:19.458 --> 30:22.208
Well, that depends, I guess.

30:22.208 --> 30:24.042
Let's take a walk.

30:26.667 --> 30:28.250
(Vanessa)
Are you sure it was Damian?

30:28.250 --> 30:31.834
He was being cute with
the language, but yeah.

30:31.834 --> 30:33.500
He admitted it.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.250
[sighs]
This kid has a really
bad reputation.

30:35.250 --> 30:39.625
You know, we should take this
to the disciplinary committee.

30:39.625 --> 30:41.125
Damian's one of
my best players,

30:41.125 --> 30:42.333
so not much
is gonna happen

30:42.333 --> 30:43.542
to him in
football country.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.458
Specially with
Bill Marsh around.

30:46.458 --> 30:48.041
What if Red didn't stop you?

30:48.041 --> 30:49.625
I mean, say
you got a video of Damian

30:49.625 --> 30:51.291
with some guy,
what were you gonna do?

30:51.291 --> 30:53.167
Ruin him.

30:55.417 --> 30:57.000
Okay, senior year
in high school

30:57.000 --> 30:59.084
I had a friend Tim.

30:59.084 --> 31:01.708
And, um, he was still
trying to figure himself out

31:01.708 --> 31:04.166
and he was not ready
to admit that he was gay.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.708
And someone that we knew

31:05.708 --> 31:08.208
um, thought it would be funny
to out him

31:08.208 --> 31:11.583
to the whole school
very publicly

31:11.583 --> 31:14.000
and he was teased
and ridiculed.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.708
I mean, his parents
were appalled.

31:19.625 --> 31:22.667
Three days later,
he hanged himself.

31:25.667 --> 31:28.667
That really happened?

31:28.667 --> 31:30.667
Well, you can imagine
how bad everyone felt

31:30.667 --> 31:32.000
when it was all over.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.792
Even the person
that outed him.

31:33.792 --> 31:36.125
'Somehow it didn't seem
so funny anymore.'

31:36.125 --> 31:37.583
But this is different.

31:37.583 --> 31:40.208
You friend didn't do
anything bad to anyone else.

31:40.208 --> 31:43.084
Damian deserves
to be punished.

31:43.084 --> 31:46.000
What if he does it again
to someone else?

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
If stopping a monster means
becoming a monster yourself

31:49.000 --> 31:50.125
was it worth it?

31:50.125 --> 31:52.834
I mean, come on, Alice,
you're better than that.

31:54.417 --> 31:57.209
So what am I
supposed to do?

31:57.209 --> 31:59.625
Just let it go?

31:59.625 --> 32:02.166
Well, first,
you take responsibility

32:02.166 --> 32:04.000
for what happened to you.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.625
You took those photos

32:05.625 --> 32:08.000
and you sent them to Jake.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.583
I know.

32:10.583 --> 32:14.000
If my dad ever finds out

32:14.000 --> 32:15.667
I'm dead.

32:18.708 --> 32:21.167
But what about Damian?

32:21.167 --> 32:22.708
What about Damian?

32:22.708 --> 32:26.542
Might I suggest
a little frontier justice?

32:31.708 --> 32:33.542
Look, I've got nothin'
to say to you.

32:33.542 --> 32:34.708
And what's he doin' here?

32:34.708 --> 32:36.959
We tell each other everything.

32:36.959 --> 32:39.291
Cheerleaders.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.458
No secrets.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.542
Even hookups.

32:42.542 --> 32:45.042
Can't keep anything to myself.

32:45.042 --> 32:47.250
I'm chatty.

32:47.250 --> 32:51.166
You hurt me
and you need to make amends.

32:51.166 --> 32:53.750
Now why would
I wanna do that?

32:53.750 --> 32:57.542
Rumor, insinuation, gossip--

32:57.542 --> 33:00.209
It's terrible how much
damage those weapons can do

33:00.209 --> 33:05.084
in the hands of a determined
and ruthless enemy.

33:05.084 --> 33:08.750
