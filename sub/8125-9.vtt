[ Announcer ]
From television city
in Hollywood.

00:05.071 --> 00:08.439
¶ Boy, the way
Glenn Miller played ¶

00:08.507 --> 00:12.176
¶ songs that made
the hit parade ¶

00:12.244 --> 00:16.047
¶ guys like us
we had it made ¶

00:16.114 --> 00:19.017
[ together ]
¶ those were the days ¶

00:20.185 --> 00:24.188
¶ and you knew
where you were then ¶

00:24.256 --> 00:27.726
[ Archie ]
¶ girls were girls
and men were men ¶

00:27.793 --> 00:30.228
[ Archie, Edith ]
¶ mister, we could use a man ¶

00:30.295 --> 00:34.565
¶ like Herbert hoover again ¶

00:34.634 --> 00:38.069
[ Archie ]
¶ didn't need no welfare state ¶

00:38.137 --> 00:41.606
[ Edith ]
¶ everybody pulled his weight ¶

00:41.674 --> 00:45.777
[ Archie, Edith ]
¶ gee, our old lasalle
ran great ¶

00:45.845 --> 00:51.983
¶ those were the days ¶

00:59.792 --> 01:03.528
hi.
Oh, hi, ma.
Tell me, how'd it go ?

01:03.595 --> 01:05.495
Is your father home ?

01:05.564 --> 01:07.498
No, not yet.
Oh, thank heavens.

01:07.566 --> 01:11.069
On the bus
I said a little prayer
that I'd get here first,

01:11.137 --> 01:13.938
but I really didn't
think it would work.

01:15.407 --> 01:19.177
Maybe I got time
to fix him something
before he gets here.

01:19.244 --> 01:22.013
Oh, don't worry, mom.
I'm warming up
yesterday's leftovers.

01:22.081 --> 01:26.051
Ohh ! Thank you.
So tell me,
what happened ?

01:26.118 --> 01:28.687
Oh, Gloria,
it was an experience.

01:28.754 --> 01:30.689
Hi, Mike.
<i>[ Mike ]</i>
<i>Hi.</i>

01:30.756 --> 01:33.925
Wait'll I hang up my coat
and I'll tell ya all about it.

01:33.993 --> 01:38.063
How'd it go ?
Oh, Mike,
it was so exciting.

01:38.130 --> 01:42.133
Well, tell us about it.
Wait'll your father
finds out.

01:42.201 --> 01:46.270
I kept pinching myself
the whole time I was there...

01:46.338 --> 01:49.741
To make sure I wasn't
watching some movie.

01:49.809 --> 01:53.211
Imagine me, Edith bunker,

01:53.278 --> 01:55.747
a member of the jury.

01:55.815 --> 01:57.749
Ooh !

01:58.751 --> 02:02.787
Even now,
feel those goose bumps.

02:02.855 --> 02:06.324
Oh, funny, they was there
a minute ago.

02:06.391 --> 02:08.993
Wish we coulda been
there to see ya, ma.
What was it like ?

02:09.061 --> 02:12.396
Oh, well,
it was very important
and formal-like.

02:12.464 --> 02:15.333
And they really do
bang those hammers.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.269
I thought I'd jump
outta my skin the first time.

02:18.337 --> 02:22.941
And the judge is so elegant
in his black robes.

02:23.008 --> 02:26.811
He looks just like
Spencer Tracy.

02:26.879 --> 02:28.813
Ooh ! There they are !

02:29.882 --> 02:31.816
Wow, that's goose bumps !

02:31.884 --> 02:34.986
Hey, ma, is it a big case ?

02:35.054 --> 02:39.057
I, uh-- I ain't allowed
to discuss it.

02:39.125 --> 02:41.993
Yeah, but, ma,
you can tell us
which case you're on.

02:42.061 --> 02:47.665
Oh, I don't know.
The judge says we wasn't allowed
to discuss it at all.

02:47.733 --> 02:50.969
And he said we might
stay down there for a while.

02:51.036 --> 02:54.205
I'll have to pack a bag
and everything.
<i>[ Gloria ] Oh.</i>

02:54.273 --> 02:57.942
I don't know what the world
is comin' to nowadays.
Oh, Archie !

02:58.010 --> 03:00.444
I tell ya,
it's gettin' worse
and worse by the minute.

03:00.512 --> 03:03.882
[ Grunts ]
It's dog-eat-dog
out there, Edith.

03:03.949 --> 03:06.417
Why ? What happened ?
One thing after another.

03:06.485 --> 03:11.589
Comin' home on the subway train,
some guy decides to throw
himself in front of the train.

03:11.657 --> 03:14.092
Holds the whole thing up
for 30 minutes.

03:16.695 --> 03:20.131
He couldn't do it
in the middle of the day.
He's gotta pick the rush hour.

03:24.103 --> 03:27.806
Would you get them two dogs
off the coffee table ?

03:29.474 --> 03:31.742
How was your day,
Archie ?

03:31.811 --> 03:36.347
How does it sound like,
Edith ?
My day was terrific !

03:36.415 --> 03:38.983
Whoopee.

03:39.051 --> 03:42.954
On top of everything else, they
was doin' reconstruction work
down at the building.

03:43.022 --> 03:45.456
They had a hole tore
in one of the walls there.

03:45.524 --> 03:48.426
It was like workin'
in the north pole
with the wind whippin' through.

03:48.493 --> 03:50.761
It's a wonder
I ain't got the bug.

03:53.866 --> 03:57.368
- Now, what's that look for ?
- What look, Archie ?

03:57.436 --> 04:01.139
You got that same look
the time you gave 50 cents
to the black panthers...

04:01.207 --> 04:04.642
Because you thought
they were gonna preserve
our wildlife.

04:10.149 --> 04:12.250
What did you do now ?

04:12.318 --> 04:15.486
Oh ! I didn't do nothin'.

04:15.554 --> 04:17.755
I'm on jury duty, Archie.

04:17.822 --> 04:20.892
Isn't that exciting,
daddy ?

04:20.959 --> 04:23.228
You're on a jury, huh ?
<i>[ Edith ]</i>
<i>Yeah !</i>

04:23.295 --> 04:25.730
Well, what's the big deal
about that ?

04:25.797 --> 04:28.233
They want people like your
mother down there...

04:28.300 --> 04:31.236
Because they know they got
no "preconscrewed" ideas.

04:33.538 --> 04:36.941
To put it another way,
they know she don't
know too much.

04:37.009 --> 04:40.278
What's the use ?
Come on, Michael,
and help me with dinner.

04:40.346 --> 04:42.780
We'll get dinner, ma.
I'll set the table.

04:42.848 --> 04:45.816
What kind of case
you on there, Edith ?
A traffic violation ?

04:47.987 --> 04:51.089
I ain't at liberty
to discuss it.

04:51.156 --> 04:53.258
What do you mean,
you ain't at liberty
to discuss it ?

04:53.325 --> 04:55.960
I'll ask you again, Edith.
What kind of case you on ?

04:56.028 --> 05:00.598
His honor says I can't, Archie,
not until it's all over.

05:00.665 --> 05:02.600
Sorry.

05:03.903 --> 05:06.337
Edith, I can understand
you don't wanna go around...

05:06.405 --> 05:08.672
Discussin' the case
with total strangers.

05:08.740 --> 05:12.443
But after all, your own
flesh and blood husband,
huh ? Come on !

05:12.511 --> 05:15.846
His honor didn't say nothin'
about tellin' husbands.

05:15.915 --> 05:19.750
Well, no, he didn't
come right out and say,
"go home and tell your husband."

05:19.818 --> 05:23.421
He took it for granted
that's what you're gonna do.
Come on !

05:23.488 --> 05:26.424
Oh, sorry.
Edith !

05:27.993 --> 05:30.895
I never
held nothin' back
from you ever.

05:30.963 --> 05:35.300
I even told you our
secret vows from the lodge.
Oh, yeah.

05:36.868 --> 05:39.670
Yeah.
The secret vow.

05:39.738 --> 05:43.908
Oni, oni, oni,
oni, poof--
stifle that, will ya !

05:45.044 --> 05:48.246
You ain't alone in here.

05:48.314 --> 05:51.916
I could get black-busted
by the brothers if they
ever found I told you that.

05:51.984 --> 05:55.119
Anyway,
the vows from the lodge
ain't the point, Edith.

05:55.187 --> 05:57.121
It's our marriage vows--

05:57.189 --> 06:02.126
till death do us part,
for better, for worse,
in secrets and in health.

06:03.562 --> 06:05.496
Oh, sorry.

06:05.564 --> 06:07.665
Let's go, folks.
Soup's on.

06:07.732 --> 06:10.034
Archie, did ma tell you
anything about the trial ?

06:10.102 --> 06:12.536
I don't wanna hear
nothin' about it !

06:12.604 --> 06:15.039
I know all about
that stuff anyway.

06:15.107 --> 06:17.475
I served my time
on the jury.

06:17.542 --> 06:19.944
He did ?
<i>[ Edith ]</i>
<i>Well, almost.</i>

06:20.012 --> 06:25.616
He was thrown off right away
'cause he insulted
the defense attorney.

06:25.684 --> 06:27.618
I didn't insult him.

06:27.686 --> 06:33.057
I told him what I thought of
pinko bleedin'-heart lawyers
defendin' killers !

06:35.127 --> 06:39.597
He asked me what I thought
of capital punishment,
and I told him.

06:39.664 --> 06:41.599
For 30 minutes.

06:44.003 --> 06:49.573
It's a proven fact that
capital punishment is a
well-known "detergent" to crime.

06:49.641 --> 06:51.476
That's bull !

06:51.543 --> 06:54.479
Capital punishment
has never been proven
to be a <i>deterrent</i> to crime.

06:54.546 --> 06:58.049
We believe it is
in this house, buddy.

06:58.117 --> 07:00.684
Well, do you believe in
capital punishment, ma ?

07:00.752 --> 07:03.787
Well, yeah, I guess so.

07:03.855 --> 07:05.789
[ Gloria ]
Mother !

07:05.857 --> 07:09.560
Well, so long as it
ain't too severe.

07:14.166 --> 07:18.569
Let me just ask you somethin',
Professor, you who don't believe
in capital punishment.

07:18.637 --> 07:23.074
Suppose you was
to come home some fine day
and find your wife's throat cut.

07:23.142 --> 07:27.111
Now, are you gonna tell me
you wouldn't be itchin' to fry
the guy that cut that throat ?

07:27.179 --> 07:29.613
No.
What good would that do ?

07:29.681 --> 07:33.051
<i>You see this guy ?</i>
<i> </i> <i>You see what you married ?</i>

07:33.118 --> 07:37.755
Some fiend could come in here
and murder you, and he ain't
gonna lift a finger to help !

07:37.822 --> 07:41.292
Archie, if I killed
that murderer, would that
bring Gloria back ? No.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.362
An eye for an eye
is not the answer.
The problem rests with society.

07:44.430 --> 07:48.132
He's always blamin' everything
on society !

07:48.200 --> 07:50.634
Listen, if you're gonna
blame society for murder,

07:50.702 --> 07:54.238
what we oughta do
is turn the killer loose,
give him a pension for life...

07:54.306 --> 07:56.807
And go out and shoot
the rest of the city !

07:56.875 --> 07:59.177
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>
<i>I'll get it.</i>

07:59.244 --> 08:02.046
I don't feel like
eating now.
Why ?

08:02.114 --> 08:04.715
I keep thinking about myself
with my throat cut.

08:07.352 --> 08:12.423
Oh, Clara, come in.
Will you have
some food with us ?

08:12.491 --> 08:16.227
No, thank you. I'm on a diet.
Everything goes to my hips.

08:16.295 --> 08:21.265
I just stopped by
to tell you I had to cook
in the lower oven tonight.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.103
<i>Is that so, Clara ?</i>

08:25.170 --> 08:28.706
You know, we've got one of
them electrics with two ovens.

08:28.773 --> 08:32.977
I always use the top
and put my pots and pans
in the bottom.

08:33.044 --> 08:34.979
Well, tonight
the top caught fire,

08:35.046 --> 08:38.216
and I had to cook
in the bottom.

08:38.283 --> 08:40.251
Ohh.

08:40.318 --> 08:44.922
You came all the way over
to tell Edith that, huh ?

08:44.990 --> 08:48.326
Yes !
You know, when you're used
to doing something one way,

08:48.393 --> 08:50.861
and without warning
you gotta change ?

08:50.929 --> 08:53.731
It can really
throw you off.

08:58.504 --> 09:00.438
Uh, bye.

09:00.506 --> 09:04.908
Clara, I'm so glad
you stopped by.
I was gonna call you later.

09:04.976 --> 09:06.910
Could I borrow your valise ?

09:06.978 --> 09:10.981
The one you took to buffalo,
with the pretty stickers
of niagara falls ?

09:11.049 --> 09:13.984
Oh, sure.
I've been picked
for jury duty.

09:14.052 --> 09:17.788
I may have to stay
in a hotel for a while.

09:17.856 --> 09:21.825
<i>Oh, isn't that special,</i>
<i>Edith.</i>

09:21.893 --> 09:24.662
<i>You must be so excited.</i>

09:24.729 --> 09:29.367
<i>It must be a very big,</i>
<i>big case if they</i>
<i>want you to stay over.</i>

09:29.434 --> 09:32.770
I'll go get the valise
and bring it back
in a little while.

09:32.837 --> 09:34.772
Thank you, Clara.

09:34.839 --> 09:39.544
And it was nice
hearing about your ovens.

09:39.611 --> 09:43.181
Wait a minute !
You didn't say nothin'
about stayin' in no hotel.

09:43.248 --> 09:45.683
How long does the judge think
this thing is gonna take ?

09:45.750 --> 09:49.353
Well, he didn't say.
At least a week.

09:49.421 --> 09:50.954
A week ?

09:51.022 --> 09:53.324
Or more.
Or more ?

09:53.392 --> 09:55.193
Sorry.

09:56.995 --> 09:59.096
It's a murder case,
isn't it, ma ?

09:59.164 --> 10:01.865
Oh, I'll bet it's
the Rodriguez case.

10:01.933 --> 10:04.202
Hey, if it's that case,
you better eat up, arch.

10:04.269 --> 10:07.871
You may not taste
mom's cookin' for weeks--
maybe months.

10:07.939 --> 10:12.109
- Look at that manson trial.
That's almost a year.
- <i>[ Gloria ] Yeah.</i>

10:16.248 --> 10:18.349
Edith, I got the bug !

10:19.884 --> 10:21.852
No, I mean it.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.623
Remember I was tellin' you about
that hole in the buildin' there,
and the wind blowin' through ?

10:25.691 --> 10:28.158
Well, I think
I got somethin'.
What are you lookin' at ?

10:28.227 --> 10:30.228
I'm not lookin' at anything !

10:30.295 --> 10:32.463
Don't gimme
none of your fish eyes !

10:32.531 --> 10:35.833
I happen to be sick.
I feel the first warning chill.

10:35.900 --> 10:39.737
I think I better call up
and maybe not go to work
in the morning.

10:39.804 --> 10:42.206
Yeah, really.
You know, you gotta
take care of these things.

10:42.274 --> 10:46.277
They could lead
to complications.
Fever today, funeral tomorrow.

10:48.079 --> 10:50.013
You ain't even warm.

10:50.081 --> 10:52.015
That don't mean nothin',
Edith.

10:52.083 --> 10:54.118
Now, I hate to do this,

10:54.185 --> 10:57.455
but you'll have to call up
the court and just tell 'em
ya can't make it.

10:57.522 --> 11:01.091
Tell 'em there's an emergency
in your home, which nobody
can argue with that.

11:01.159 --> 11:04.729
But, Archie,
I've already been selected.

11:05.964 --> 11:09.700
Edith...
Who selected you first ?

11:12.871 --> 11:14.972
What are you waitin' for ?

11:15.039 --> 11:17.408
I'm thinkin' it over.

11:17.476 --> 11:20.144
You don't have to think.
Do like I tell ya.

11:20.211 --> 11:23.547
Make the phone call.
Go ahead, Edith.
Pick it up.

11:24.616 --> 11:26.651
And when you're done,
uh,

11:26.718 --> 11:29.953
you better bring me
some hot water
and lemon juice... upstairs.

11:30.021 --> 11:32.122
And bring me
that vaporizer.

11:32.190 --> 11:35.225
And then I'm gonna need
that electric heating pad
for under me.

11:35.294 --> 11:38.696
Find the bed tray,
because you're gonna
have to bring me my meals...

11:38.764 --> 11:40.864
Upstairs where
I'll be in the bed.

11:40.932 --> 11:42.866
Now, go on, Edith.

11:44.000 --> 11:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:53.077 --> 11:57.481
Would you find that bed tray ?
I think it's in the cupboard
under the sink.

11:57.549 --> 12:00.250
Ma, are you really gonna
serve him his meals in bed ?

12:00.319 --> 12:03.688
Oh, no.
I guess you will.

12:03.755 --> 12:06.490
I'll be on jury duty.

12:21.406 --> 12:23.341
Gloria, you home ?

12:29.648 --> 12:31.582
Meathead ?

12:39.791 --> 12:43.427
A man comes home from work,
and what's there to meet him ?

12:43.495 --> 12:45.429

13:27.205 --> 13:29.573
About 30 minutes.

A man comes home from work,

13:56.501 --> 13:58.869
In your wife sitting on
one of the hottest murder trials

Ah, what's so hot
about it, huh ?

They got better murders
on the late show.

This thing is an
open-and-shut case.
Wait a minute.

14:08.580 --> 14:12.049
I admit, it doesn't look too
good for Rodriguez, but that
doesn't mean it's open-and-shut.

Listen, listen, listen, listen.
The d.A. Nailed the coffin down
on that guy yesterday.

14:16.721 --> 14:21.258

go home to his apartment house
up in Spanish Harlem.

14:21.326 --> 14:23.461
Another witness seen him
go into the apartment.

14:23.528 --> 14:27.598
All right. He goes in there,
he finds his old lady in there
with another spick.

14:29.167 --> 14:33.904
What does he do ?
He whips out his switchblade,
and zap !

14:33.972 --> 14:36.907
Sends him to that big taco stand
up in the sky.

14:41.212 --> 14:43.146
What do you expect ?

14:43.214 --> 14:46.350

those puerto ricans
are caged up in those slums.

14:46.417 --> 14:48.519

the tension builds.

16:13.104 --> 16:16.506
I never count snack bars.

16:16.575 --> 16:20.477
Uh, Mrs. bunker,
I'd like you to consider
that if it weren't for you,

16:20.545 --> 16:25.716
all of us on the jury
could be back with our families
enjoying home-cooked meals.

16:25.784 --> 16:30.988
I think it's nice
for someone else to do
the cooking for a change.

16:32.657 --> 16:36.026
Well, personally,
I prefer my own Eric
to prepare dinner.

16:36.094 --> 16:38.696

does the cooking ?

16:38.763 --> 16:43.601

to waste 'em.

17:01.319 --> 17:04.722
Mm, my Archie
would love those

17:26.310 --> 17:30.447
I don't care to hear
about your twinkies !

17:30.515 --> 17:33.117
I just want to go home !

17:33.184 --> 17:37.921
I simply don't understand
why you keep insisting
that Rodriguez is innocent,

17:37.989 --> 17:42.359
when three neighbors
said they saw him
entering the building.

17:42.426 --> 17:45.228
They could've
been mistaken.

17:45.296 --> 17:47.264
Three different people ?

17:47.331 --> 17:50.467
Oh, it could've been
somebody else.

17:50.535 --> 17:54.772
You said yourself
that all puerto ricans
look alike.

17:56.307 --> 17:59.910
To us, not to each other.

18:02.413 --> 18:07.584
I don't know.
There's something about the way
he keeps saying he's innocent.

18:07.652 --> 18:12.489
Oh, that doesn't mean a thing.
All those people are born liars.

18:12.557 --> 18:15.993
Besides, you have the neighbors
who say they saw him.

18:16.061 --> 18:19.096
Well, if they was
all born liars,

18:19.164 --> 18:22.632
how can you believe
the neighbors ?

18:28.707 --> 18:33.043
Because they're not accused
of anything.

18:33.111 --> 18:37.781
Mrs. bunker,
it's time we stopped
coddling these criminals.

18:37.849 --> 18:41.051
Those mad dogs
have got to be
put behind bars.

18:41.119 --> 18:44.922
He's not a mad dog.
He's a nice-looking young boy.

18:44.989 --> 18:47.891
Well, then look at it
this way--

18:47.959 --> 18:51.228
we'd be doing that
nice-looking young boy
a favor...

18:51.295 --> 18:54.431
By taking him out of
that rat-infested ghetto,

18:54.498 --> 18:58.035
and put into a nice,
clean prison.

18:59.170 --> 19:01.105
Still, his honor said,

19:01.172 --> 19:05.876
"a man has to be guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt."

19:05.944 --> 19:09.113
Eleven of us say
he's guilty.

19:09.180 --> 19:13.016
Well, I got
a reasonable doubt.

19:13.084 --> 19:16.887
And you're being totally
unreasonable about it !

19:17.956 --> 19:21.458
I-I don't mean to be.

19:21.525 --> 19:23.861
Mrs. stonehurst,

19:26.664 --> 19:30.634

all the time, huh ?

19:30.701 --> 19:34.738
The only decisions I ever make
is what to serve for dinner,

19:34.806 --> 19:39.342
or how much starch
to put in Archie's collars.

19:39.410 --> 19:41.344
In all--

19:44.548 --> 19:49.186
in all my life,
this is the first time...

19:49.254 --> 19:51.955

my opinion...

19:52.023 --> 19:55.192
About something
that really matters.

19:55.260 --> 19:58.728
And they'll probably
never ask me again.

19:58.797 --> 20:01.298
So you see,
Mrs. stonehurst,

20:01.365 --> 20:04.134
