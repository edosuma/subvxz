01:02.241 --> 01:03.943
Hi.

01:05.878 --> 01:07.512
Hi.

01:09.549 --> 01:11.650
I'm Bob.

01:13.453 --> 01:15.353
Scott.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.061
Okay, there you go.
Good boy.

01:23.095 --> 01:25.563
Wait, no, don't lick it off.
Don't. That's good.

01:25.798 --> 01:27.265
Okay.
I mean, look.

01:27.299 --> 01:29.100
Look how Cannibal's
doing it, see?

01:29.134 --> 01:30.534
<i>See there?</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

01:30.568 --> 01:32.302
Good boy.

01:32.336 --> 01:34.037
I need them
on set, Scott.

01:34.071 --> 01:36.439
Right away.
Okay, you know your lines?

01:36.473 --> 01:38.541
You know your lines?

01:44.148 --> 01:46.049
Come on.

01:48.584 --> 01:52.221
<i>Lou says we can't do the
growl and the attack in one shot.</i>

01:52.255 --> 01:53.655
We can do it,

01:53.690 --> 01:55.024
but we need to do it
in two separate pieces.

01:55.058 --> 01:57.193
We need to prep the dogs
separately for the attack.

01:57.227 --> 01:59.228
I just don't understand
why we can't get it in one.

01:59.262 --> 02:01.663
Because he's got the bite
suit on under his clothes,

02:01.698 --> 02:05.266
so the dogs see him
as a big old chew toy.

02:05.301 --> 02:08.401
I mean, it's fun for
them, they love it.

02:08.437 --> 02:10.371
It's a safety issue.

02:10.405 --> 02:13.441
Scene 37, take one.

02:13.475 --> 02:15.076
Speed!

02:15.110 --> 02:17.511
A and B camera,
common mark.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.148
Brownie!

02:21.182 --> 02:22.649
Cannibal!

02:22.683 --> 02:24.852
Bullet!

02:24.886 --> 02:26.920
Right here, boys.

02:26.955 --> 02:29.289
- We set?
- Set.

02:29.324 --> 02:30.757
And action!

02:50.978 --> 02:53.845
<i>Scottie.
Your mother called.</i>

02:56.682 --> 02:58.383
<i>What did she want?</i>

02:58.417 --> 03:00.718
To see you.

03:02.454 --> 03:05.023
- Do I have to?
- No.

03:05.057 --> 03:06.391
Joe.

03:06.425 --> 03:11.195
No, of course not,
but... she's your mother.

03:11.229 --> 03:14.798
She says she's doing
much better.

03:14.832 --> 03:17.334
- <i>For how long this time?</i>
- Joe, stop.

03:17.369 --> 03:19.236
I'll think about it.

03:19.271 --> 03:21.372
<i>Humph.</i>

03:21.406 --> 03:24.941
Oh, and a man named
Bob Black called.

03:26.010 --> 03:27.410
Oh, okay.

03:27.444 --> 03:30.246
Is that one of them
San Francisco fellas?

03:30.281 --> 03:33.316
No. He's from here.
West Hollywood.

03:34.251 --> 03:36.119
Oh.

03:41.490 --> 03:45.327
<i>- Hey, cheeks!</i>
- Shh!

03:45.361 --> 03:47.029
This is
where you live?

03:47.063 --> 03:49.097
Yeah. Why?

03:49.132 --> 03:52.367
You must have moved in after the
Clampetts left for Beverly Hills.

03:53.869 --> 03:55.437
Bye, Rose.
I'll see you tomorrow!

03:55.471 --> 03:57.371
- Have a good time!
- Okay.

03:57.406 --> 03:59.307
This is Bob.

03:59.341 --> 04:02.709
- Oh, hi, Bob.
- Hi, Rose.

04:10.419 --> 04:12.485
<i>And now,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

04:12.519 --> 04:14.520
<i>the star of the show...</i>

04:14.555 --> 04:17.757
<i>the man who's famous</i>
<i>throughout the world...</i>

04:17.791 --> 04:20.360
<i>for his candelabra...</i>

04:20.394 --> 04:22.595
<i>and his piano...</i>

04:22.629 --> 04:25.531
<i>Mr. Showmanship...</i>

04:25.566 --> 04:27.567
<i>Liberace!</i>

04:51.623 --> 04:52.790
Hey!

05:01.299 --> 05:04.001
Now, this next part of the
boogie woogie is so strange,

05:04.035 --> 05:06.103
it really calls
for an explanation.

05:06.137 --> 05:09.206
<i>It's called</i>
<i>a boogie woogie break.</i>

05:09.240 --> 05:12.409
When I'm playing it
and I stop at a certain point...

05:12.443 --> 05:15.712
you're going to think
I've forgotten the music.

05:15.746 --> 05:17.713
But I didn't forget
the music.

05:17.747 --> 05:19.815
There's just no music
written for that part.

05:19.849 --> 05:22.118
That's why they call it
a break.

05:25.122 --> 05:26.389
Hey!

05:33.896 --> 05:36.631
Oh, this is fun.

05:36.665 --> 05:38.133
Let's try something.

05:38.167 --> 05:40.568
Suppose only the ladies
in the audience

05:40.602 --> 05:42.270
<i>this time, okay?</i>

05:42.304 --> 05:44.572
<i>All the girls together.</i>

05:47.943 --> 05:49.176
Hey!

05:57.018 --> 05:59.153
Oh, that was
terrific.

05:59.187 --> 06:03.157
Okay, fellas.
It's your turn now.

06:06.826 --> 06:08.428
Hey!

06:16.103 --> 06:18.704
I love it!
That was terrific!

06:19.838 --> 06:21.473
You see, George?
I told you

06:21.507 --> 06:23.675
<i>men do come</i>
<i>to my concerts.</i>

06:23.709 --> 06:26.478
<i>Well, I really appreciate it.</i>

06:26.512 --> 06:28.280
And I know somebody else
out in the audience

06:28.314 --> 06:31.616
who appreciates it, too.
And that's my mom.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.785
<i>Mom, I tell you what.</i>

06:33.819 --> 06:37.988
Let them hear it from you...
and I'll play it just for you.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.990
Okay, Mom?

06:44.429 --> 06:46.330
Hey!

06:54.271 --> 06:57.740
Oh, Mom, you're in
the groove tonight.

06:57.774 --> 06:59.275
I really
thank you all

06:59.310 --> 07:01.578
for joining me
in this boogie woogie.

07:01.612 --> 07:04.347
I'd like to try
a little experiment.

07:04.381 --> 07:06.082
I've been playing
this boogie woogie

07:06.117 --> 07:08.517
at eight beats
to the bar.

07:08.551 --> 07:10.452
I'd like to try
playing it now

07:10.487 --> 07:13.054
at 16 beats
to the bar.

07:30.539 --> 07:32.173
Wow!

07:33.074 --> 07:35.709
He's incredible!

08:01.368 --> 08:03.835
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

08:03.870 --> 08:05.471
- Thank you.
<i>- Bravo.</i>

08:05.505 --> 08:07.239
You know...

08:07.274 --> 08:10.809
No, that's all right.
Stare as long as you want.

08:10.843 --> 08:13.678
I mean, you paid for it.

08:15.347 --> 08:19.217
You know, I always get asked...
"How do you play the piano

08:19.251 --> 08:22.420
with all those rings
on your fingers?"

08:22.454 --> 08:26.457
And I always tell them,
"Very well indeed."

08:29.694 --> 08:31.828
Thank you.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.765
And now I'd like
to introduce

08:35.799 --> 08:38.669
another pair
of piano-playing hands

08:38.703 --> 08:41.136
to join me in a duet.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.807
My protégé and friend,

08:43.841 --> 08:46.475
<i>Mr. Billy Leatherwood!</i>

08:53.650 --> 08:55.251
<i>Oh, look!</i>

08:55.285 --> 08:58.754
A matched pair of queens.

09:00.523 --> 09:03.358
Oh.

09:03.392 --> 09:06.261
It's funny that this crowd
would like something this gay.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.831
Oh, they have no idea he's gay.

09:26.814 --> 09:29.683
There's Ray.
See him? In the back.

09:30.719 --> 09:32.752
Come on, come on!

09:34.187 --> 09:36.289
Ray! Ray.

09:36.323 --> 09:39.091
Bobby!

09:39.126 --> 09:42.128
- I'm so glad you made it!
- We loved it. Thank you so much.

09:42.162 --> 09:43.895
This is my friend,
Scott Thorson.

09:43.929 --> 09:45.330
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

09:45.365 --> 09:47.633
That was really something.
Thank you.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.868
- Come on back and say hi to Lee.
- You sure?

09:49.902 --> 09:51.870
Yes, he'd love
to see you!

09:53.839 --> 09:56.241
Lee?
Look who's here!

09:56.276 --> 10:00.711
- Hello, Bobby!
- Lee, you were fantastic!

10:00.746 --> 10:02.413
This is my friend,
Scott Thorson.

10:02.447 --> 10:04.448
His first time
in Las Vegas.

10:04.483 --> 10:06.884
A lost babe
in the woods, huh?

10:06.918 --> 10:10.020
<i>It's like a Disney movie.</i>
<i>Little Bambi.</i>

10:10.054 --> 10:12.156
Very nice to meet you.

10:12.190 --> 10:14.291
You were incredible
out there.

10:14.325 --> 10:17.126
Oh, I'm just
a piano player.

10:17.161 --> 10:19.596
But everybody did seem to enjoy
themselves, didn't they?

10:21.465 --> 10:23.667
You were great,
too, Billy.

10:26.470 --> 10:28.371
Ray, why don't we fix
everybody a drink?

10:28.406 --> 10:30.406
- All right.
- I'm not going to have one.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.741
I still have
another show to do.

10:32.776 --> 10:35.076
What... you're going to
do that all over again?

10:35.111 --> 10:36.745
I don't know
how you do that.

10:36.780 --> 10:38.880
Oh, aren't you sweet!

10:38.915 --> 10:40.783
It's not bad
for an old bag, huh?

10:40.817 --> 10:42.718
<i>Oh, you look fantastic!</i>

10:42.752 --> 10:45.253
<i>And those bits</i>
<i>with the audience are gold!</i>

10:45.288 --> 10:46.688
<i>They work every time.</i>

10:46.722 --> 10:49.056
<i>I stage this show</i>
<i>once a year.</i>

10:49.090 --> 10:51.759
<i>It works the same way</i>
<i>every single night.</i>

10:51.794 --> 10:54.261
I'll tell you, when I was
working saloons in my youth--

10:54.296 --> 10:56.798
back in Milwaukee,
they called them saloons.

10:56.832 --> 10:58.899
That's how old I am.

10:58.934 --> 11:00.835
I'm from Wisconsin, too.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.936
No! You are?

11:02.970 --> 11:05.071
Well, this
must be fate.

11:05.105 --> 11:07.741
<i>One night,</i>
<i>this audience asked me</i>

11:07.775 --> 11:11.311
to play this popular hit parade
song called "Three Little Fishes".

11:11.346 --> 11:12.879
It barely had a melody,

11:12.913 --> 11:15.181
it wasn't a challenge
at all...

11:15.216 --> 11:18.117
but I played it, you know,
and they were happy.

11:18.152 --> 11:21.186
And then, I don't know
where it came from...

11:21.221 --> 11:23.389
<i>but I got this inspiration</i>
<i>to play it</i>

11:23.423 --> 11:26.459
<i>as if it was composed</i>
<i>by Strauss.</i>

11:26.493 --> 11:28.327
And they loved it!
They ate it up!

11:28.362 --> 11:31.897
You would have thought that I invented the piano.

11:31.931 --> 11:33.432
And I knew
right then

11:33.467 --> 11:35.600
it was all about
giving them a good time.

11:35.634 --> 11:37.569
<i>And that's what</i>
<i>I'm all about.</i>

11:37.603 --> 11:41.906
I <i>love</i> to give people
a good time.

11:41.940 --> 11:43.742
<i>Bobby, you boys
staying in town tonight?</i>

11:43.776 --> 11:46.110
<i>Oh, yes. It's too
late to drive back to L.A.</i>

11:46.144 --> 11:49.381
<i>Lee, why don't we have the
boys over for brunch tomorrow?</i>

11:49.415 --> 11:51.815
<i>No, that's
too much for you.</i>

11:51.850 --> 11:53.717
No, no.
That's a great idea!

11:53.752 --> 11:55.051
Of course!
Let's do it.

11:55.086 --> 11:56.920
But after 3:00,
okay?

11:56.954 --> 11:59.456
'Cause I need
my beauty sleep.

12:26.749 --> 12:28.349
Welcome, gypsies!

12:28.384 --> 12:30.285
Is this a palace?

12:30.319 --> 12:33.655
Lee thinks
he's King Ludwig II.

12:33.689 --> 12:36.792
- Who's he?
- The Liberace of Bavaria.

12:36.826 --> 12:38.926
Oh, is he
a piano player, too?

12:38.960 --> 12:40.394
No.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.934
Wow.

12:46.968 --> 12:49.169
Almost time
for a dip.

12:54.442 --> 12:57.710
I'm sorry
I'm so informal.

12:57.745 --> 12:59.946
So happy you all could come.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.281
Don't these things
belong in an oven?

13:02.316 --> 13:03.983
He's so mean
to my babies.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.118
I mean,
this is my family.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.754
And this is Baby Boy.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.422
Baby Boy,

13:09.457 --> 13:13.659
he's very old.
He's deaf, and he's blind.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.327
I'm his
seeing eye person.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.197
I could get something to
help clear up his eyes.

13:19.231 --> 13:22.267
<i>- Scott works with animals.</i>
- Oh.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.636
I worked for a vet
you know, for a while,

13:24.671 --> 13:26.971
and we had a lot of poodles
with eye problems.

13:27.005 --> 13:29.006
Oh, that would be
fabulous!

13:29.040 --> 13:31.442
No one's been able to help
my little Baby Boy.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.411
I hate
to see him suffer.

13:34.446 --> 13:36.313
<i>I think my favorite review</i>

13:36.348 --> 13:38.048
<i>is from San Francisco,</i>

13:38.083 --> 13:41.418
<i>when they said:</i>
<i>"Liberace was no Rubinstein...</i>

13:41.453 --> 13:44.454
<i>but then Rubinstein</i>
<i>is no Liberace."</i>

13:44.489 --> 13:48.291
This is my houseboy, Carlucci.

13:48.325 --> 13:51.394
He rules the roost
around here.

13:53.631 --> 13:55.665
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:57.502 --> 13:59.267
Pig.

14:00.303 --> 14:01.670
- What?
- <i>Pig in a blanket.</i>

14:01.705 --> 14:03.873
You want a pig
in a blanket?

14:07.844 --> 14:10.145
No. Thanks.

14:20.489 --> 14:24.425
After lunch, I'll give
you a guided tour.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.962
Great.

14:37.772 --> 14:39.873
<i>I do all my own decorating.</i>

14:39.908 --> 14:41.708
I just love it.

14:41.743 --> 14:44.444
I call this
"palatial kitsch".

14:44.478 --> 14:47.279
- Right.
- Don't you just love that?

14:47.313 --> 14:49.248
I never saw
so many pianos.

14:49.282 --> 14:51.183
Oh, I never touch them.

14:51.217 --> 14:54.486
Mama made me play
every day in my childhood.

14:54.521 --> 14:56.388
Didn't have
any friends.

14:56.423 --> 14:59.625
So now I never play...
when I play.

15:01.628 --> 15:03.695
These are actual
Roman columns.

15:03.729 --> 15:06.064
<i>Ionic.</i>

15:13.238 --> 15:14.940
I personally
support

15:14.974 --> 15:19.009
the entire Austrian
rhinestone business.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.510
It's too bad
you're so big,

15:20.545 --> 15:22.546
you could try
one of these on.

15:22.581 --> 15:26.283
So, Scott, do you have
any family left?

15:26.317 --> 15:28.052
Oh, no, not really.

15:29.586 --> 15:33.223
My mom's been
in and out of places,

15:33.257 --> 15:35.058
<i>you know,</i>
<i>for my whole life.</i>

15:35.092 --> 15:36.659
Oh, really?

15:36.694 --> 15:39.829
And I have two sisters...
and a brother,

15:39.863 --> 15:42.665
and then four
half-brothers and sisters...

15:42.700 --> 15:44.166
from two
different fathers.

15:44.201 --> 15:46.335
Most of them live
with their fathers.

15:46.369 --> 15:49.138
The rest of us,
like me and Wayne,

15:49.172 --> 15:50.939
we were sent
to state-run homes...

15:50.974 --> 15:54.109
<i>and then Mom would come get us and
we'd live with her for a while,</i>

15:54.143 --> 15:57.245
<i>then... she'd have her troubles again
and they'd have to put her away</i>

15:57.279 --> 16:00.548
<i>so we'd get split up</i>
<i>and sent to foster homes.</i>

16:00.583 --> 16:03.919
But I was really lucky.
I ended up with Rose and Joe.

16:03.953 --> 16:07.688
You know, a really nice
family, on a ranch..

16:07.723 --> 16:09.890
<i>You know,</i>
<i>with animals.</i>

16:09.925 --> 16:12.426
Sure, because
it was a ranch!

16:12.460 --> 16:14.061
What a story!

16:14.096 --> 16:17.632
You got everything but a
fire in the orphanage.

16:17.666 --> 16:21.502
But the ranch is where you
got to like animals, and...

16:21.536 --> 16:24.037
I guess.

16:24.071 --> 16:26.840
And I am going to try and get
that medicine for Baby Boy.

16:27.874 --> 16:29.308
You remembered
his name.

16:29.343 --> 16:32.012
That would be
wonderful.

16:33.147 --> 16:35.581
I'm going to give you
my private number.

16:35.616 --> 16:37.751
<i>It's unlisted.</i>

16:39.185 --> 16:42.454
Now, I'm counting
on you...

16:42.488 --> 16:45.223
so don't you forget.

16:51.865 --> 16:54.399
You'd better not walk
onto my stage

16:54.433 --> 16:55.833
with a ketchup stain.

16:55.868 --> 16:58.870
Like anyone
would give a shit.

17:01.373 --> 17:04.308
He's so unprofessional.

17:05.477 --> 17:08.813
- Hello?
- <i>Hi. This is Scott... Thorson.</i>

17:08.847 --> 17:11.647
- I'm sorry, who?
- <i>Scott. I'm Bob's friend.</i>

17:11.683 --> 17:14.584
<i>I was at L-- his house.</i>
<i>I have medicine for his dog.</i>

17:14.617 --> 17:15.652
Hold on.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.654
- A Scott somebody.
- Who?

17:17.689 --> 17:19.422
- Friend of Bob's. who was at your house.
- Oh, Scott!

17:19.455 --> 17:21.058
He has medicine?

17:21.092 --> 17:23.226
Scott, is that you?

17:23.260 --> 17:26.229
Hi.
Um... Yeah...

17:26.262 --> 17:28.898
Mr.--

17:28.932 --> 17:31.433
<i>No, no. Please,</i>
<i>just call me Lee.</i>

17:31.467 --> 17:32.935
Lee. Okay.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.704
I have
the medicine

17:34.738 --> 17:37.173
for your poodle.
For his eyes?

17:37.207 --> 17:39.374
Oh, my savior!

17:39.409 --> 17:42.144
I was going to just

17:42.179 --> 17:44.412
tuck it in the mail
tomorrow morning...

17:44.446 --> 17:47.849
and it should be there,
you know, in a few days.

17:47.883 --> 17:50.952
Oh, no, no. I don't want Baby
Boy to have to wait that long.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.655
Why don't you just book a flight
and come up this evening?

17:54.690 --> 17:56.791
At my expense.

17:56.826 --> 18:00.861
It's not that important.

18:00.895 --> 18:03.997
Scott, why don't you let me
decide what's important.

18:04.032 --> 18:06.633
You know, you'd be
doing me a great favor

18:06.667 --> 18:08.435
if you'd fly up here
this evening.

18:08.469 --> 18:11.638
<i>And I promise you I'll fly
you right back to L.A.</i>

18:11.672 --> 18:13.506
<i>after my first show.</i>

18:13.541 --> 18:17.043
- <i>I promise.</i>
- Okay.

18:19.213 --> 18:24.050
Alone at last.

18:24.084 --> 18:27.186
Thank you so much for
bringing my baby's medicine.

18:27.221 --> 18:31.022
No problem.
He's going to be fine.

18:31.057 --> 18:34.492
What would you like to do
with your life, Scott?

18:34.526 --> 18:36.895
What's your dream?

18:36.929 --> 18:38.463
I want to be
a veterinarian.

18:38.497 --> 18:41.633
Oh, don't you
just love animals?

18:41.667 --> 18:43.534
So do I.

18:43.569 --> 18:47.537
You know, because they
love you, no matter what.

18:47.572 --> 18:51.441
That's what makes them
dumb animals, I guess.

18:51.476 --> 18:53.177
<i>If they really knew</i>
<i>who we were,</i>

18:53.211 --> 18:56.280
they'd have nothing
to do with us.

18:59.717 --> 19:02.452
Scott, I...

19:02.487 --> 19:04.453
I feel like
I can trust you.

19:04.488 --> 19:08.158
<i>And I have to talk</i>
<i>to someone.</i>

19:10.427 --> 19:13.396
I've got myself
in a terrible mess.

19:13.430 --> 19:15.899
What is it?

19:15.933 --> 19:20.035
It's Billy.
My protégé.

19:20.069 --> 19:23.405
I've created a monster.
A monster!

19:23.439 --> 19:25.240
I gave him everything.

19:25.275 --> 19:28.310
- I put his name in lights-- I made him famous.
- What did he do?

19:28.344 --> 19:31.280
Well, he's out of control!
He's ruining me!

19:31.314 --> 19:34.516
He's ruining my image!
I can't stand bad publicity!

19:34.550 --> 19:36.150
My fans, you know?

19:36.185 --> 19:39.554
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>they're not dumb animals.</i>

19:39.588 --> 19:41.556
He's just... he's done
terrible things!

19:41.590 --> 19:43.191
He's breaking
my heart.

19:43.225 --> 19:46.427
It's just he's drinking heavily,
he's getting into fights.

19:46.461 --> 19:47.929
And I can't
get rid of him!

19:47.963 --> 19:50.832
He's under contract
for six months!

19:50.866 --> 19:52.834
I'm going to be ruined!

19:52.868 --> 19:55.837
I just wish his wife
would come and take him away.

19:56.705 --> 19:58.672
His <i>wife?</i>

19:59.573 --> 20:02.075
Hand me a towel, please.

20:04.045 --> 20:06.046
Thank you.

20:08.415 --> 20:11.517
I never know whether
people like me for me,

20:11.552 --> 20:13.486
or what they can get
out of me.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.922
You know,
because I'm Liberace.

20:16.957 --> 20:19.524
Walter <i>Liberace,</i>
<i>for God's sakes!</i>

20:19.559 --> 20:21.426
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>can you imagine?</i>

20:21.461 --> 20:23.795
<i>I mean, Walter's fine</i>
<i>for Pidgeon,</i>

20:23.830 --> 20:26.465
but Liberace?

20:26.499 --> 20:29.335
It was the only thing
my father gave me.

20:29.369 --> 20:31.236
He was
a French horn player.

20:31.270 --> 20:33.771
He left us
for an oboist.

20:35.741 --> 20:37.942
So that's why
you're so musical?

20:37.977 --> 20:39.844
No, that man had
nothing to do with it.

20:39.879 --> 20:42.914
My talent
comes from God.

20:42.948 --> 20:44.715
Everybody wants
a piece of me,

20:44.750 --> 20:47.184
a piece
of the action.

20:47.218 --> 20:50.787
My brother George, he
performs in some small club.

20:50.821 --> 20:52.289
You know what
the marquee says?

20:52.323 --> 20:54.892
"Liberace",
in big letters.

20:54.926 --> 20:57.327
I built that name.
It's my name.

20:57.362 --> 20:59.496
That's not his.

21:00.932 --> 21:03.499
"Gimme, gimme, gimme."

21:03.533 --> 21:07.303
No one I can trust,
no one I can talk to.

21:07.337 --> 21:11.007
I hate my life sometimes.
I really do.

21:11.041 --> 21:13.175
- No.
- No, it's true.

21:13.210 --> 21:16.845
No matter how many people are
around, I'm all by myself.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.314
Like, I'm with people--

21:18.348 --> 21:21.449
they're not really
my family or my friends.

21:21.483 --> 21:24.185
You know what
that feels like?

21:24.220 --> 21:27.389
Yeah. I do.

21:28.391 --> 21:31.026
Yes.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.128
Yes, you do.

21:34.096 --> 21:37.731
You've been good
for me, Scott.

21:37.765 --> 21:39.633
When?

21:39.667 --> 21:41.568
Now.
Just now.

21:41.602 --> 21:44.138
- Oh, you mean talking and--
- Yes, you know.

21:44.172 --> 21:45.705
And listening.

21:45.740 --> 21:47.207
You're very good
at listening.

21:47.242 --> 21:50.377
People... take...

21:51.312 --> 21:53.712
You know what?

21:53.747 --> 21:56.849
I have a great idea.

21:58.118 --> 22:01.087
Why don't you come
work for me?

22:02.356 --> 22:03.856
As what?

22:03.890 --> 22:06.992
Well, you could be
my secretary.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.361
I don't type.

22:09.395 --> 22:12.164
<i>Hell, Scott, I can</i>
<i>pay people to type.</i>

22:12.198 --> 22:14.732
I need a companion.
A bodyguard.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.269
Someone to keep people
off my back.

22:17.303 --> 22:20.638
Someone I can talk to
the way we talked tonight.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.674
<i>You'd be</i>
<i>my right-hand man.</i>

22:23.708 --> 22:26.677
You can take care
of the animals.

22:26.711 --> 22:28.812
Please.

22:28.847 --> 22:32.016
Say yes, Scott.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.920
Would you close the
drapes on the window, Scott?

22:36.955 --> 22:39.222
Yeah.

22:40.424 --> 22:42.658
It's really pretty
at night.

22:42.693 --> 22:44.627
I'm sorry.

22:44.661 --> 22:47.563
I didn't mean to
scare you like that.

22:47.598 --> 22:49.699
Yeah, I just...

22:49.733 --> 22:54.204
Things
are moving really fast.

22:54.238 --> 22:56.438
Maybe I should just get
a room for tonight.

22:56.473 --> 22:57.572
Oh, nonsense.

22:57.607 --> 23:00.575
Look, I completely
understand

23:00.610 --> 23:03.578
and I promise I'll stay
on my side of the bed.

23:03.613 --> 23:05.247
I promise.

23:43.183 --> 23:45.784
Good morning.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.595
Well, look who's up!

24:09.542 --> 24:11.383
<i>You're making a mistake here.
Listen to me.</i>

24:11.410 --> 24:14.979
- <i>I worked for that old fag in his Hollywood house!</i>
<i>- Joe!</i>

24:15.013 --> 24:16.746
Oh, I'm not saying it
for that.

24:16.781 --> 24:20.451
I'm saying it's not
a fit place for Scott!

24:20.485 --> 24:22.586
You don't know him
like I know him.

24:22.620 --> 24:25.355
<i>Is this the kind of
life you want for yourself?</i>

24:25.390 --> 24:27.124
It's a job, Rose.

24:27.158 --> 24:28.758
And it pays better
than getting two.

24:28.793 --> 24:31.260
Yeah, and you know what
they call that kind of job.

24:31.295 --> 24:33.463
That's not what this is.

24:33.497 --> 24:34.897
<i>Look, he's old.</i>

24:34.931 --> 24:37.700
He doesn't like me
just for that.

24:37.734 --> 24:39.935
Do you even like
this man?

24:41.838 --> 24:44.707
Yeah. I really do.

24:44.741 --> 24:46.775
He's lonely.

24:47.710 --> 24:50.011
I can take care
of him.

24:50.045 --> 24:51.746
And he can
take care of me.

24:53.449 --> 24:55.850
My eyes
are open, Rose.

24:56.719 --> 24:58.553
I promise.

25:33.687 --> 25:35.320
Mr. Thorson!

25:35.355 --> 25:36.955
Seymour Heller,
Lee's manager.

25:36.989 --> 25:38.723
Lee's expecting you.

25:45.898 --> 25:47.932
Is it any good?

25:47.967 --> 25:50.001
It's amazing.

25:51.670 --> 25:53.837
I love to cook.

25:55.073 --> 25:57.975
We'll be a couple
of fat biddies in no time.

25:58.009 --> 26:00.278
Great,
'cause I love to eat.

26:05.317 --> 26:06.917
Come here, you.

26:20.498 --> 26:22.765
She's going to see us.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.235
People only see
what they want to see, Scott.

26:31.974 --> 26:35.344
Oh, God! Oh, God!

26:35.378 --> 26:36.878
Oh, my God.

26:45.954 --> 26:48.889
We'll go shopping
tomorrow.

26:50.593 --> 26:52.893
After cooking and sex,

26:52.928 --> 26:56.697
I think shopping's the reason
to get up every day.

26:56.731 --> 26:59.466
And it helps
so many people.

27:00.935 --> 27:04.003
Do you mind if I ask you
something?

27:04.038 --> 27:07.140
How do you stay hard
for so long? I mean...

27:07.174 --> 27:10.076
that was the fourth time
since lunch.

27:10.111 --> 27:13.412
You make me feel
so young.

27:14.881 --> 27:17.316
And I've had implants.

27:18.619 --> 27:22.722
I've had quite a drive,
you know, as well

27:22.756 --> 27:27.459
and... you know,
I've had problems.

27:27.493 --> 27:30.562
And it's a terrible thing
when you have such a desire

27:30.596 --> 27:32.664
and the equipment
doesn't work.

27:32.698 --> 27:34.566
It's like

27:34.600 --> 27:37.068
wanting to sing
and being tone deaf.

27:37.102 --> 27:39.471
And no one knows.

27:39.505 --> 27:41.339
You're the only one
I told.

27:41.374 --> 27:42.940
You see what
you mean to me?

27:42.975 --> 27:45.075
Lee, I think--
just a minute.

27:45.109 --> 27:46.810
I should
just tell you...

27:48.079 --> 27:50.347
I'm bisexual.

27:50.382 --> 27:52.783
I like women, too.

27:53.818 --> 27:56.520
Well, good for you.

27:56.554 --> 27:58.489
I love women!

27:58.523 --> 28:00.757
I wish I could be
that flexible.

28:00.791 --> 28:03.760
Makes things
so much easier.

28:03.794 --> 28:06.396
I am so sick
of getting fan mail

28:06.430 --> 28:09.265
about my engagement
to Sonja Henie.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.100
As if I would marry
an ice skater.

28:11.134 --> 28:12.769
Please--
I mean, those thighs.

28:14.004 --> 28:18.540
No, I was a goner
from my first time.

28:18.574 --> 28:22.077
He was
a Green Bay Packer.

28:22.112 --> 28:24.113
He came to hear me play
at one of my saloons.

28:24.147 --> 28:25.380
I couldn't miss him--

28:25.415 --> 28:28.450
the guy was
the size of the door.

28:28.484 --> 28:31.053
That's how I lost
my virginity.

28:31.087 --> 28:34.622
Isn't that romantic?

28:34.656 --> 28:37.525
You know, I tried
to make myself love women.

28:37.559 --> 28:40.061
I'd stare at women's bosoms
and their backsides,

28:40.095 --> 28:42.797
you know, trying
to feel <i>something.</i>

28:42.832 --> 28:46.600
You see, I knew...
from being Catholic

28:46.635 --> 28:49.536
what happened
to boys like me.

28:49.570 --> 28:51.104
And I went
to confession.

28:51.139 --> 28:55.375
Of course, I couldn't
confess everything.

28:55.409 --> 28:57.878
The problem was,
according to Catholics...

28:57.912 --> 29:01.781
not confessing a sin
is also considered a sin...

29:01.816 --> 29:05.684
so, you know, I was damned
if I do, damned if I didn't.

29:05.719 --> 29:09.488
I can't believe
you're still Catholic.

29:09.522 --> 29:11.157
Devout.

29:12.492 --> 29:14.793
The turning point
for me...

29:14.828 --> 29:18.297
was Kennedy
getting assassinated.

29:18.332 --> 29:22.734
<i>I was working non-stop</i>
<i>and I was sick.</i>

29:22.768 --> 29:24.836
<i>I felt terrible.</i>

29:24.871 --> 29:26.371
<i>We found out later...</i>

29:26.405 --> 29:30.008
<i>that when those heavy costumes</i>
<i>I wear get dry cleaned...</i>

29:30.042 --> 29:32.610
<i>they use this</i>
<i>tetrachloride solution.</i>

29:32.644 --> 29:34.913
<i>I would sweat...</i>
<i>and it'd get absorbed</i>

29:34.947 --> 29:39.116
<i>into my bloodstream...</i>
<i>and shut down my kidneys.</i>

29:39.150 --> 29:41.385
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

29:41.419 --> 29:43.287
<i>But no one knew.</i>

29:43.321 --> 29:45.989
<i>So I'm watching</i>
<i>the assassination on TV</i>

29:46.023 --> 29:48.358
<i>and I think... at least</i>
<i>I'll have a few days off.</i>

29:48.393 --> 29:51.661
<i>I mean, nobody's going to come</i>
<i>see me perform</i> this <i>weekend.</i>

29:51.696 --> 29:56.132
<i>But, no.</i>
<i>No, Seymour made me work.</i>

29:56.166 --> 29:58.435
<i>They thought</i>
<i>I was dying.</i>

29:58.469 --> 30:01.136
<i>They couldn't figure out</i>
<i>what was wrong.</i>

30:01.170 --> 30:02.772
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>everything's bloated.</i>

30:02.806 --> 30:05.240
<i>I'm drowning</i>
<i>in my own fluids.</i>

30:05.275 --> 30:07.877
<i>They put me on dialysis</i>
<i>and I'm thinking...</i>

30:07.911 --> 30:11.547
<i>the only thing that's going to
get me through this is prayer.</i>

30:11.581 --> 30:14.016
<i>Sometime within these</i>
<i>36 hours of treatment...</i>

30:14.050 --> 30:16.050
<i>I wake up,</i>
<i>and there's this nun</i>

30:16.084 --> 30:20.488
<i>in an all-white habit</i>
<i>sitting beside my bed.</i>

30:20.523 --> 30:21.956
<i>I said</i>
<i>I wanted to pray,</i>

30:21.990 --> 30:24.959
<i>and she told me</i>
<i>not to waste my strength.</i>

30:24.993 --> 30:28.296
<i>And she assured me</i>
<i>I would live.</i>

30:28.330 --> 30:32.266
<i>Next day, my kidneys</i>
<i>start to work.</i>

30:32.301 --> 30:34.468
<i>The doctors were amazed!</i>

30:34.502 --> 30:36.971
<i>They admitted to me</i>
<i>they had given up hope.</i>

30:37.005 --> 30:39.506
<i>So I asked</i>
<i>to see the nun...</i>

30:39.541 --> 30:42.076
<i>to thank her</i>
<i>for giving me strength,</i>

30:42.110 --> 30:44.878
<i>and... they said,</i>
<i>"Oh, no,</i>

30:44.913 --> 30:48.949
<i>there's no nun here</i>
<i>that fits that description."</i>

30:48.983 --> 30:52.852
<i>"There are no nuns here</i>
<i>that wear all-white habits."</i>

30:52.886 --> 30:55.721
And I knew.

30:55.756 --> 30:58.624
I knew my life
would not have been spared

30:58.659 --> 31:04.229
if being gay was the sin
that the Church said it was.

31:04.264 --> 31:08.167
I was saved... because
God looks upon me

31:08.201 --> 31:10.702
with special favor.

31:10.736 --> 31:14.940
That nun...
was a messenger.

31:16.576 --> 31:18.777
Wow.

31:18.811 --> 31:21.145
Isn't that something?

31:21.180 --> 31:25.016
But, Scott-- men, women--
you know, who cares?

31:25.050 --> 31:27.718
What's important
is to be yourself.

31:27.752 --> 31:30.221
You just be who you
are, baby boy.

31:45.003 --> 31:48.305
Don't eat all of this.

31:48.339 --> 31:52.375
You'll be angry that
your panties are tight.

31:52.409 --> 31:54.377
Ah-ooh.

31:54.411 --> 31:57.446
- You want some, Scott?
- Mm-mm.

32:01.318 --> 32:02.451
Mm!

32:02.486 --> 32:04.987
These are delicious.

32:05.022 --> 32:06.889
Here.

32:06.923 --> 32:08.890
Have one.

32:12.594 --> 32:15.330
Does he
do that every night?

32:15.364 --> 32:17.665
Mm-hmm.

33:14.086 --> 33:19.590
<i>♪ Have yourself
a merry little Christmas... ♪</i>

33:19.624 --> 33:20.891
<i>Be careful, Scott.</i>

33:20.925 --> 33:25.696
<i>♪ Let your heart</i>
<i>be light... ♪</i>

33:25.730 --> 33:27.030
Perfect.

33:27.065 --> 33:30.733
<i>♪ From now on,</i>
<i>our troubles ♪</i>

33:30.767 --> 33:33.869
<i>♪ Will be</i>
<i>out of sight... ♪</i>

33:33.904 --> 33:35.838
He made you
a pesto panini.

33:35.872 --> 33:37.707
Oh.

33:39.210 --> 33:43.146
Did you bring
my Fresca?

33:47.083 --> 33:48.717
What?

33:52.355 --> 33:55.056
Here's what's going to happen.
You listening?

33:55.091 --> 33:58.026
You think you're so hot
and sexy with your hard ass

33:58.060 --> 34:00.794
and that bisexual
bullshit.

34:00.829 --> 34:02.696
You know how many
there have been?

34:02.731 --> 34:05.065
Bobby, Hans, Chase.

34:05.100 --> 34:06.800
Oh, and some
country boy stripper

34:06.835 --> 34:09.536
who was so dumb he wore
his G-string backwards.

34:09.571 --> 34:11.539
He got rid
of all of them.

34:11.572 --> 34:13.072
But I'm still here.

34:13.108 --> 34:16.243
And one day,
Lee is going to call Seymour...

34:16.277 --> 34:18.878
and he's going to tell him
to get rid of you.

34:24.585 --> 34:26.453
Lee?

34:28.956 --> 34:30.757
Lee?

34:32.725 --> 34:34.760
Oh, excuse me.
I was--

34:37.797 --> 34:39.197
Lee?

34:39.232 --> 34:42.400
Right here,
baby boy.

34:43.936 --> 34:47.873
<i>You've never seen me</i>
<i>without my hair, have you?</i>

34:48.907 --> 34:52.810
Terrible.
Terrible, isn't it?

34:52.844 --> 34:56.714
But the pieces,
they're great.

34:56.748 --> 34:58.783
You know what
I'm going to do?

34:58.817 --> 35:01.419
I'm going to put you
in charge of my wigs.

35:01.453 --> 35:03.954
<i>I only do that</i>
<i>for people I trust.</i>

35:03.989 --> 35:07.857
- <i>Would you like that?</i>
- Lee, I'm sorry, but...

35:07.892 --> 35:10.026
I think maybe
this was a mistake.

35:10.061 --> 35:12.529
What's wrong?
What?

35:12.564 --> 35:13.997
<i>I can't do this.</i>

35:14.031 --> 35:17.033
I can't live like this,
in this house.

35:17.068 --> 35:19.203
I mean, everybody
looks down on me.

35:19.237 --> 35:22.004
<i>Carlucci is always on
my ass about something.</i>

35:22.038 --> 35:24.840
<i>He's treating me</i>
<i>like</i> I'm <i>the houseboy.</i>

35:25.842 --> 35:27.610
I just, I can't
live like this.

35:27.644 --> 35:28.711
I'm sorry.

35:28.745 --> 35:31.880
I don't want
to see you depressed.

35:31.915 --> 35:35.618
When you have a sad face,
then I feel sad.

35:35.652 --> 35:40.222
But it's not sad, it's...
This isn't working.

35:40.256 --> 35:43.024
Well, then I've failed.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.193
Because you have
made me so happy...

35:45.228 --> 35:47.929
<i>over these past</i>
<i>few months.</i>

35:47.963 --> 35:52.766
And if I haven't
made you happy...

35:52.800 --> 35:56.537
Your happiness means
everything to me, Scott.

35:59.708 --> 36:03.544
I just don't know
what to do.

36:44.516 --> 36:46.850
<i>Why do I love you?</i>

36:46.885 --> 36:50.388
<i>I love you</i>
<i>not only for what you are</i>

36:50.422 --> 36:53.891
<i>but for what I am</i>
<i>when I'm with you.</i>

36:53.925 --> 36:58.928
<i>I love you not only for what
you have made of yourself</i>

36:58.962 --> 37:02.666
<i>but for what</i>
<i>you are making of me.</i>

37:02.700 --> 37:06.469
<i>I love you for ignoring</i>
<i>the possibilities...</i>

37:06.504 --> 37:09.673
<i>of the fool in me.</i>

37:09.707 --> 37:12.874
<i>And for accepting</i>
<i>the possibilities</i>

37:12.909 --> 37:15.644
<i>of the good in me.</i>

37:23.353 --> 37:26.188
<i>Why do I love you?</i>

37:26.222 --> 37:29.290
<i>I love you</i>
<i>for closing your eyes</i>

37:29.325 --> 37:32.393
<i>to the discords in me.</i>

37:32.428 --> 37:35.697
<i>And for adding</i>
<i>to the music in me</i>

37:35.731 --> 37:38.700
<i>by worshipful listening.</i>

37:46.574 --> 37:48.375
No, I don't
like it.

37:48.409 --> 37:49.909
- It makes it better.
- I don't want it.

37:49.944 --> 37:52.879
Oh. Oh!

37:57.585 --> 38:01.387
I've always
wanted children.

38:01.388 --> 38:05.924
I regret that--
not having children.

38:05.959 --> 38:09.395
I love Christmas.
I think I'd be a good daddy,

38:09.429 --> 38:13.966
- don't you think?
- Oh, you're such a loving man.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.034
Mmm.

38:16.069 --> 38:18.470
Well, maybe
I'll adopt <i>you.</i>

38:21.273 --> 38:24.576
I want you to take the money
that you're earning...

38:24.610 --> 38:27.612
and buy a house
here in Las Vegas.

38:29.482 --> 38:31.315
I'll co-sign.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.949
But it'll be
in your name,

38:32.984 --> 38:36.787
so... you'll have
some security.

38:37.822 --> 38:39.322
Would you like that?

38:39.357 --> 38:43.293
Lee...
are you serious?

38:44.729 --> 38:47.431
I want to be everything
to you, Scott.

38:47.465 --> 38:50.833
I want to be
father... brother...

38:50.868 --> 38:54.871
lover... best friend.

38:54.905 --> 38:56.806
Everything.

39:00.110 --> 39:02.111
You know I love you.

39:04.147 --> 39:07.849
Does that mean
anything to you?

39:07.884 --> 39:09.951
Maybe all
those years...

39:09.985 --> 39:14.155
all those
foster homes...

39:14.189 --> 39:17.358
maybe I'm your
real family.

I was the first
matinee idol

40:23.554 --> 40:26.023
in television.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.959
I was the one had the idea
of putting the candelabra

40:28.994 --> 40:30.694
up on the piano,
you know?

40:30.728 --> 40:34.130
I saw an old
Merle Oberon movie

40:34.164 --> 40:37.000
when I got the idea.
From, uh... about Chopin.

40:37.034 --> 40:40.203
What was the name of that...?
"A Song to Remember"!

40:40.237 --> 40:42.538
Really? That's like
your trademark!

40:42.572 --> 40:45.475
I know.
Who knew?

40:45.509 --> 40:47.943
Wow.

40:47.978 --> 40:49.511
Huh.

40:49.545 --> 40:52.447
So, really, no matter
what you did,

40:52.482 --> 40:56.651
you were just...
meant to be famous.

40:56.685 --> 40:58.987
I guess so.

40:59.855 --> 41:01.490
Hmm.

41:05.127 --> 41:07.594
( Groans

41:07.629 --> 41:10.231
Hello.

41:10.265 --> 41:13.567
Oh, hi.
Yeah, hold on.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.102
It's Seymour.

41:15.137 --> 41:18.039
I told him not to call
this number.

41:19.307 --> 41:21.774
I told you not to call
this number.

41:21.808 --> 41:23.109
Hi, Lee.
I'm sorry,

41:23.144 --> 41:24.310
I have to talk to you
about these dates.

41:24.345 --> 41:25.945
We've got six months
of bookings.

41:25.979 --> 41:28.415
I already told you
the dates I would do.

41:28.449 --> 41:30.616
I'm not working after Thanksgiving

41:30.651 --> 41:33.920
during the holidays.
Especially now.

41:33.954 --> 41:36.221
But you can make double
on holiday shows.

41:36.256 --> 41:37.722
Take a vacation later.

41:37.757 --> 41:40.259
Seymour,
I do not want to be

41:40.293 --> 41:42.428
the richest piano player
in the grave.

41:42.462 --> 41:43.995
- Forget it.
- No, definitely not.

41:44.030 --> 41:45.497
You're already
working too hard.

41:45.532 --> 41:49.301
Lee, give the phone to Scott.
I have a question for him.

41:52.171 --> 41:53.471
Hey, Seymour.

41:53.505 --> 41:54.772
Hey, Scott.

41:54.806 --> 41:56.674
Why don't you stay
out of my fucking business?

41:56.708 --> 41:58.376
Now give me back
to Lee.

42:02.847 --> 42:06.617
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

42:06.651 --> 42:09.052
No, you cannot come
for dinner tomorrow night.

42:09.087 --> 42:11.455
I'm making pork.

42:11.489 --> 42:14.091
Okay.
Bye-bye.

42:14.125 --> 42:16.893
Ay-yi-yi!
Oy!

42:16.927 --> 42:19.696
Doesn't he get insulted when you
don't invite him over for dinner?

42:19.730 --> 42:22.365
He gets 10% of every
dollar I earn.

42:22.400 --> 42:25.468
I don't have to
take him out for dinner.

42:25.502 --> 42:28.337
And I don't want
any company.

42:28.371 --> 42:33.709
I want my blond Adonis
all to myself.

42:36.879 --> 42:38.680
Oh, shit!

42:38.715 --> 42:40.715
Shit, shit, shit!

42:40.749 --> 42:43.551
- Carson!
- Oh, hurry! Hurry!

42:43.586 --> 42:46.721
<i>Have we missed</i>
<i>my performance?</i>

42:48.324 --> 42:51.259
Oh. Tsk.

42:58.899 --> 43:02.769
<i>Oh, my Christ!
I look like my father!</i>

43:02.803 --> 43:05.439
I look like
my father in drag!

43:05.473 --> 43:09.943
I look like my father in
"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"!

43:11.112 --> 43:13.379
I would say
a full face lift...

43:13.413 --> 43:15.982
with silicone implants
to prevent the return

43:16.017 --> 43:17.951
of the lines
around the mouth.

43:17.985 --> 43:19.418
My feeling?

43:19.453 --> 43:22.122
Why go through all of the
work and the money...

43:22.156 --> 43:24.257
just to have it all
fall down within a year?

43:24.291 --> 43:27.393
You pay good money,
it should last.

43:27.427 --> 43:30.162
Some of these doctors,
they keep you coming back

43:30.196 --> 43:32.731
and paying,
time after time.

43:32.766 --> 43:35.233
- I don't believe in it.
- No, you're right.

43:35.268 --> 43:37.302
You know, I had
all this done a while ago,

43:37.336 --> 43:41.473
but I don't think
he was as good as you are.

43:42.575 --> 43:44.276
I'm going to recommend
a deep face peel

43:44.310 --> 43:45.677
after the face lift.

43:45.711 --> 43:48.279
You're going
to look fabulous!

43:48.313 --> 43:50.347
You'll look as young
as Scott here.

43:50.382 --> 43:52.850
Oh, thank you!
I feel so much better.

43:52.885 --> 43:54.952
I mean, that Carson show
was like looking

43:54.987 --> 43:58.756
at Dorian Gray
wither away in public.

43:58.791 --> 44:00.257
But what about
the press?

44:00.292 --> 44:02.793
How do we keep this
a secret?

44:02.827 --> 44:05.796
We rent you a fully furnished
apartment under an alias

44:05.830 --> 44:07.731
until the bandages
come off.

44:07.765 --> 44:09.166
No one will know.

44:09.200 --> 44:12.569
After that, you can
recuperate as you like.

44:12.603 --> 44:14.838
Jack, I wish
I'd met you sooner.

44:14.872 --> 44:17.173
I would still have
had a movie career!

44:17.207 --> 44:20.109
That was my real dream--
to be a movie star.

44:20.143 --> 44:23.445
Now, Jack, I want
to talk to you

44:23.479 --> 44:25.948
about doing some surgery
on Scott here.

44:25.982 --> 44:27.216
What?

44:27.250 --> 44:28.283
Fine.

44:28.318 --> 44:30.619
What would you like me
to do with Scott?

44:33.189 --> 44:36.591
I want you to make Scott
look like this.

44:37.593 --> 44:39.293
Can you do that?

44:42.164 --> 44:43.598
Oh, I see.

44:43.632 --> 44:46.267
Yes, I think
I can do what you want.

44:47.236 --> 44:49.369
He's going to need
a nose job.

44:49.403 --> 44:52.172
And I'm going to have to
restructure his cheekbones

44:52.207 --> 44:54.541
and his chin
with silicone implants,

44:54.575 --> 44:56.409
<i>but it's not</i>
<i>impossible.</i>

44:56.444 --> 44:59.913
But first we have to
slim him down!

44:59.948 --> 45:03.784
I have a terrific diet.
The California Diet.

45:03.818 --> 45:07.887
Guaranteed loss of 15 pounds
in four weeks.

45:17.297 --> 45:19.031
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

45:19.066 --> 45:22.033
The man wants to spend money to
make you thinner, prettier,

45:22.068 --> 45:24.335
and younger and you are
thinking about not doing it.

45:24.370 --> 45:25.904
But I <i>am</i> young.

45:25.938 --> 45:29.141
Honey, in gay years,
you're Judy

45:29.175 --> 45:31.743
during the Sid Luft
obese period.

45:31.778 --> 45:34.112
Really?

45:34.147 --> 45:36.714
They were talking about me
like I wasn't even there.

45:36.749 --> 45:39.750
If Lee doesn't get what
he wants, you won't be.

45:40.986 --> 45:44.088
Well, I guess
I should be flattered,

45:44.122 --> 45:46.957
him wanting me
to look like him.

45:46.992 --> 45:49.193
<i>Imitation's</i>
<i>the highest form.</i>

45:49.227 --> 45:52.263
That's what they tell
drag queens when they're born.

45:53.597 --> 45:55.698
Oh, I don't know, man.

45:55.732 --> 45:57.967
I mean, won't it be weird
looking in a mirror

45:58.002 --> 45:59.535
and not recognizing
myself?

45:59.569 --> 46:02.272
Should we take the Auburn
or the Camaro?

46:12.649 --> 46:15.884
I just don't understand
why I cannot keep my hair on

46:15.919 --> 46:18.153
during the procedure.

46:19.222 --> 46:22.157
If I die, I want you
to get in here--

46:22.192 --> 46:24.293
I don't care if you have
to slap it on with Elmer's--

46:24.328 --> 46:26.027
before anybody
sees me.

46:26.061 --> 46:28.730
You're not
going to die.

47:04.798 --> 47:08.902
Oh, you are doing
so well, Lee!

47:08.936 --> 47:11.071
Isn't he doing well?

47:12.306 --> 47:16.075
I guess it's time to get
started on you, huh?

47:16.109 --> 47:18.878
First, we're going to do
something about that weight.

47:21.314 --> 47:23.582
The California Diet.

47:23.616 --> 47:28.854
Those pounds
will just fall off!

47:55.313 --> 47:58.615
You look, easily,
right now...

47:58.649 --> 48:01.584
like a man
in his mid-40s.

48:05.255 --> 48:07.890
Will I be able
to close my eyes?

48:07.925 --> 48:09.558
Not entirely.

48:09.592 --> 48:13.129
But this way, you'll always be
able to see people's expressions

48:13.163 --> 48:15.898
when they see
how <i>fabulous</i> you look.

48:19.735 --> 48:22.237
Sweetie,
you're snoring.

48:28.744 --> 48:32.013
Lee!

48:43.325 --> 48:46.427
Sweetie, you're snoring.

49:01.741 --> 49:04.444
Oh, look at you!

49:04.478 --> 49:07.779
- My Adonis is coming back.
- Really?

49:07.813 --> 49:09.914
Come here.

49:22.394 --> 49:25.062
What are these for?

49:25.097 --> 49:27.498
Post surgery.

49:27.532 --> 49:30.267
Okay, but I stay
on the California Diet?

49:30.302 --> 49:31.902
Perfectly safe.

49:31.936 --> 49:33.804
Just keep
taking those.

49:33.838 --> 49:36.240
And one of these
is a prescription

49:36.274 --> 49:38.208
for my own
special diet pill.

49:38.242 --> 49:42.112
Uh, I want
a dimple on my chin.

49:42.146 --> 49:44.814
Scott, Lee doesn't have
a dimple on his chin.

49:44.848 --> 49:46.916
I know, but...

49:46.950 --> 49:49.284
You know,
it's my face.

49:49.319 --> 49:51.888
Not too deep,
just a little one.

49:54.024 --> 49:55.625
Okay.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.661
You think
Lee'll be mad?

50:05.801 --> 50:10.005
Sleep tight,
my baby boy.

50:10.039 --> 50:12.774
I'll see you
on the other side.

51:43.760 --> 51:46.629
<i>Scott, it's
so good to hear your voice.</i>

51:46.663 --> 51:48.396
I'm sorry, Rose.

51:48.431 --> 51:50.198
Just with Lee's schedule,
it's been so crazy.

51:50.233 --> 51:52.534
I didn't say it
to make you feel bad.

51:52.568 --> 51:54.168
So talk to me.
How are you?

51:54.202 --> 51:55.937
You taking care
of yourself?

51:55.971 --> 51:57.105
I'm great.

51:57.139 --> 51:59.573
I've lost a whole lot
of weight, actually.

51:59.608 --> 52:02.309
<i>What for? You always
had such a nice build.</i>

52:02.344 --> 52:04.078
No, no,
it's a healthy thing.

52:04.113 --> 52:06.080
It's the California Diet.

52:06.115 --> 52:07.782
Lee and I
did it together.

52:07.816 --> 52:10.851
<i>He's really</i>
<i>into self-improvement.</i>

52:10.885 --> 52:12.853
Oh.

52:12.887 --> 52:16.957
How is
Mr. Lee-berace?

52:16.991 --> 52:18.659
He's great.

52:18.693 --> 52:21.427
Actually,

52:21.462 --> 52:23.997
we're going to see
some lawyers tomorrow...

52:24.032 --> 52:26.999
because, um, he wants
to adopt me.

52:27.901 --> 52:30.803
<i>Adopt</i> you?

52:30.837 --> 52:33.005
I don't understand.

52:33.040 --> 52:38.678
<i>Why would a grown man want</i>
<i>to adopt another grown man?</i>

52:40.047 --> 52:42.613
So we can be family.

52:44.216 --> 52:46.985
I don't understand.

52:47.019 --> 52:49.120
In the state of Nevada,
if you're over 18,

52:49.155 --> 52:50.755
you have the right
to be adopted...

52:50.790 --> 52:52.523
whether your parents
are living or deceased.

52:52.558 --> 52:54.258
So it won't be
an issue.

52:54.293 --> 52:56.827
Well, then--
that's great.

52:56.861 --> 53:00.097
Now, John, I want to make
this perfectly clear.

53:00.131 --> 53:01.631
I don't want a word
of this out there

53:01.666 --> 53:04.935
until the adoption is complete.
Not a word.

53:04.969 --> 53:08.638
As your lawyer, I'm legally
bound <i>not</i> to discuss it.

53:08.673 --> 53:12.542
I know, but, you know,
in casual conversation.

53:13.443 --> 53:15.111
No one...

53:15.145 --> 53:18.081
I mean, <i>no one</i> has ever
been closer to me

53:18.115 --> 53:21.150
than this young man.

53:21.185 --> 53:24.053
I want to make sure
he's taken care of forever...

53:25.122 --> 53:28.357
no matter what
happens to me.

53:28.391 --> 53:31.593
<i>The coat costs $300,000.</i>

53:31.627 --> 53:35.197
It is made entirely
of virgin white fox.

53:35.231 --> 53:37.065
The train
is 16 feet long--

53:37.100 --> 53:38.633
that is the longest
in the world.

53:38.667 --> 53:42.637
It was designed exclusively
for him by Anna Nateece.

53:42.671 --> 53:47.875
It has $100,000 worth of
Austrian crystals which line it.

53:47.909 --> 53:50.644
And that is why it is the
only coat in the world

53:50.678 --> 53:53.147
with its own
chauffeur and car.

53:53.181 --> 53:55.682
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

53:55.717 --> 53:57.384
- Would you sign this?
- Sure, yes.

53:57.418 --> 53:59.019
- <i>Please. My name is Sue.</i>
- Sue.

53:59.054 --> 54:00.887
<i>But, dear, you can ask him.</i>

54:00.921 --> 54:02.956
Oh, I know.

54:08.095 --> 54:09.595
There you are.

54:10.564 --> 54:13.199
- $3.
- Thank you.

54:16.470 --> 54:20.338
<i>You're Liberace's
son, aren't you?</i>

54:23.910 --> 54:25.577
<i>So, how you doing, Ma?</i>

54:25.611 --> 54:28.013
You happy?

54:28.047 --> 54:30.115
It is what it is.

54:31.517 --> 54:34.451
Well, is the nurse
working out for you?

54:34.486 --> 54:36.353
Yeah, I think so.

54:36.388 --> 54:38.622
I mean,
they're fine.

54:40.859 --> 54:43.627
So, is there
anything that you need?

54:43.662 --> 54:45.196
No.

54:45.230 --> 54:48.732
No, I'm just lonely,
that's all.

54:48.767 --> 54:53.270
You can't do anything
for loneliness.

54:56.007 --> 54:58.541
Well, you've got
George and Dora, right?

54:58.575 --> 55:01.311
They're a few minutes away. Don't
they come down for a visit?

55:01.345 --> 55:04.781
Same faces.

55:04.815 --> 55:07.883
Every day,
same faces.

55:12.755 --> 55:15.124
So, do you want me
to bring Angie from L.A.?

55:15.158 --> 55:17.059
- Bring her down?
- Oh, no!

55:17.093 --> 55:18.727
No, don't need that.

55:18.761 --> 55:21.362
Please, I don't
need that. No.

55:21.396 --> 55:24.866
No. All I need
is to be near <i>you.</i>

55:24.900 --> 55:29.103
But you know out here,
all alone, I don't know...

55:29.138 --> 55:31.572
it's every day the same.
You know,

55:31.606 --> 55:33.308
but you, you have--
it's too much.

55:33.342 --> 55:36.410
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

55:39.080 --> 55:42.015
But I know...
it's too much.

55:42.050 --> 55:43.951
You always going
to give everything,

55:43.985 --> 55:44.985
you're so busy--

55:45.019 --> 55:46.753
<i>it's too much!</i>
<i>I understand.</i>

55:46.787 --> 55:50.390
Give my son some more
iced tea, please.

55:50.424 --> 55:52.592
This will be good
for you, not <i>this.</i>

55:52.626 --> 55:54.060
Mm-mm.

56:01.301 --> 56:03.402
Thank you.

56:03.436 --> 56:06.005
Oh, thank you so much.

56:06.039 --> 56:07.673
Oh.

56:07.707 --> 56:10.075
You're all
just so wonderful.

56:10.109 --> 56:12.878
I feel so close
to you all.

56:12.912 --> 56:15.046
I feel like I can
tell you something

56:15.081 --> 56:17.715
that I haven't told
anyone at all.

56:17.750 --> 56:20.919
But you have to promise
it stays in this room.

56:20.953 --> 56:23.755
In my early days...

56:23.789 --> 56:26.357
before sound
was invented...

56:27.825 --> 56:31.428
Well, I look pretty good
for 35, don't I?

56:39.104 --> 56:40.504
Well, anyway,

56:40.538 --> 56:43.339
back then,
classical piano players

56:43.374 --> 56:45.574
always wore
black tuxedos.

56:45.609 --> 56:48.778
Plain old
black tuxedos.

56:48.812 --> 56:52.348
My mother, she wanted me
to be classical...

56:52.383 --> 56:54.784
but I just couldn't stay
out of the saloons.

56:56.387 --> 57:00.088
But I did have a concert
at the Hollywood Bowl...

57:00.123 --> 57:02.490
and I was excited.

57:02.525 --> 57:04.092
If you've never
been there,

57:04.127 --> 57:06.528
it's open air--
it's tremendous!

57:06.562 --> 57:09.464
It's got 10,000 people!

57:09.498 --> 57:12.700
I show up
for the rehearsal,

57:12.735 --> 57:15.970
and I look at this vast...
this beautiful,

57:16.004 --> 57:19.540
enormous
open-air theater.

57:19.574 --> 57:23.877
And I look
at the black piano.

57:23.912 --> 57:26.247
I think,
"Hmm."

57:26.281 --> 57:30.450
"Black piano,
black tuxedo."

57:30.484 --> 57:34.454
"Who is going to see me
in this giant clam shell?"

57:36.523 --> 57:39.859
Well, I ask you...
can you see me now?

58:24.068 --> 58:25.768
<i>All I'm saying is..</i>

58:25.803 --> 58:27.137
why can't we have fun?

58:27.171 --> 58:29.272
- Kvetch, kvetch, kvetch!
- See people, you know?

58:29.307 --> 58:33.142
Go to a party
every once in a while.

58:33.176 --> 58:34.877
- All I do is give, give, give!
- Maybe see somebody.

58:34.911 --> 58:36.979
And no matter how much I buy
you, it's never enough!

58:37.014 --> 58:40.082
I'm not asking you
to buy me anything, Lee.

58:40.117 --> 58:43.185
I'm just-- I'm crawling the
walls a little, that's all.

58:43.220 --> 58:45.154
Why can't we
see people?

58:45.188 --> 58:46.855
What are you
talking about?

58:46.890 --> 58:49.190
I took you to the Jim Nabors-
Dom DeLuise concert.

58:49.225 --> 58:52.927
That was...
that was one time.

58:52.961 --> 58:55.230
Scott, I'm tired.
I work all night.

58:55.264 --> 58:57.132
- This is not an inexpensive life.
- I know,

58:57.166 --> 58:59.234
but you don't even
let me go out by myself!

58:59.268 --> 59:01.136
- Why?
- I don't know!

59:01.170 --> 59:04.539
Just to go out
and see people

59:04.573 --> 59:07.741
and talk to them.
Just for a break!

59:07.775 --> 59:09.309
A break from me?

59:09.344 --> 59:10.777
Why do you need
a break from me?

59:10.811 --> 59:11.912
I don't need
a break from--

59:11.946 --> 59:13.013
I mean for you
to come with me!

59:13.048 --> 59:14.448
I can't say
anything right.

59:14.482 --> 59:16.283
Please don't
be unhappy.

59:16.317 --> 59:18.685
I can't stand it when you
have a face like that.

59:18.719 --> 59:20.354
Especially after
the money I paid for it.

59:20.388 --> 59:22.255
Oh, you
want it back?

59:22.289 --> 59:24.190
You want me to invite Charo
for brunch again?

59:24.224 --> 59:26.859
- You liked her.
- Yeah, I like her fine, but--

59:26.893 --> 59:30.196
But what?! What is it with you?
It's never enough!

59:30.230 --> 59:32.731
What more can I give?

59:32.766 --> 59:34.467
I'm not--

59:35.469 --> 59:39.104
I'm happy, okay?
I am.

59:39.138 --> 59:42.474
It's just... you have
to try to understand...

59:42.508 --> 59:44.342
being somebody's
boyfriend?

59:44.377 --> 59:46.343
This is not
exactly the life

59:46.378 --> 59:49.246
that I had planned
for myself, you know?

59:49.281 --> 59:52.583
I mean, I was going to be
a veterinarian.

59:52.617 --> 59:54.885
You want to help
animals?

59:54.919 --> 59:58.089
Pick up the dog shit.

59:58.957 --> 01:00:00.424
And you listen
to me.

01:00:00.459 --> 01:00:02.492
You stop taking
those pills, okay?

01:00:02.526 --> 01:00:04.427
Jack gives you
too much.

01:00:04.462 --> 01:00:07.063
He's got some people
addicted, I hear.

01:00:07.098 --> 01:00:09.499
You're getting too thin,
you're always in a mood.

01:00:09.533 --> 01:00:12.235
- People are noticing.
- Oh, who? Seymour?

01:00:12.269 --> 01:00:13.936
Seymour hates me.

01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:15.438
- They all hate me.
- See, this is what I mean.

01:00:15.473 --> 01:00:17.639
It's that shit
talking!

01:00:25.515 --> 01:00:29.518
Hey, you know what a woman said
to me in the casino today?

01:00:29.552 --> 01:00:32.887
She asked me
if I was Liberace's son.

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:38.426
- Really?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:00:39.828 --> 01:00:41.562
Oh.

01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:44.098
- Come here.
- No.

01:00:44.133 --> 01:00:45.566
Come here.
Come here.

01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:48.836
You don't get anything.
You get nothing.

01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:51.938
I get it all.

01:00:51.972 --> 01:00:54.073
- Yes, I do. Please.
- Can I ask you a question?

01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:55.775
- Yes.
- Can we go out?

01:00:55.809 --> 01:00:58.044
Oh...

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:04.117
<i>Walter was a twin.</i>

01:01:04.152 --> 01:01:05.851
Really?
He never told me.

01:01:05.885 --> 01:01:08.920
Yeah, but the twin
was born dead.

01:01:09.822 --> 01:01:12.291
But Walter...

01:01:12.325 --> 01:01:16.262
Walter,
he weighed 13 pounds.

01:01:18.665 --> 01:01:21.566
Even in the womb, he wanted
more than anyone else!

01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:25.970
What's a mother to do?

01:01:26.004 --> 01:01:28.473
She loves
the child <i>more.</i>

01:01:28.507 --> 01:01:31.042
Now the <i>world</i> must
give him what he needs.

01:01:31.076 --> 01:01:32.777
Mm-hmm.

01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:37.048
God. God gives us
the power.

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:41.117
It's not luck.

01:01:41.152 --> 01:01:43.654
It's who you are.

01:01:46.591 --> 01:01:47.924
- Oh!
- Whoa!

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.660
I win, I win!

01:01:49.694 --> 01:01:52.796
I win, I win.
Look, look, look, I wi--

01:01:53.730 --> 01:01:55.565
<i>Lee?</i>

01:01:55.599 --> 01:01:57.433
Lee.

01:01:57.467 --> 01:01:59.268
- Lee.
- What? What is it?

01:01:59.303 --> 01:02:01.304
She won, but there's
no money in the machine.

01:02:01.338 --> 01:02:04.840
Oh, for chrissakes.

01:02:04.874 --> 01:02:06.742
I don't have any change.

01:02:06.776 --> 01:02:09.111
She won big.

01:02:09.145 --> 01:02:11.145
Do you have
anything?

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:12.847
Gladys, do you have
any cash on you?

01:02:12.881 --> 01:02:14.583
<i>So, Ma, this is all we have.</i>

01:02:14.617 --> 01:02:16.685
But look
how much I won.

01:02:16.719 --> 01:02:19.020
No, I know, but we don't
have any more cash.

01:02:19.054 --> 01:02:21.022
But...

01:02:21.056 --> 01:02:24.292
Okay. Okay.

01:02:24.327 --> 01:02:27.394
So I'll take
a check.

01:02:34.369 --> 01:02:36.203
Are you
proposing to me?

01:02:36.238 --> 01:02:40.841
I just don't have a lot of
ready cash available, so...

01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:43.710
I can't go to Lee, 'cause he
doesn't want me taking it anymore.

01:02:43.744 --> 01:02:45.245
Well, that's silly.

01:02:45.279 --> 01:02:47.614
He wants you to stay
skinny, doesn't he?

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:49.849
Silly.

01:02:49.883 --> 01:02:52.184
<i>I mean, I'd like to
wean myself off it...</i>

01:02:52.219 --> 01:02:54.120
<i>eventually,</i>
<i>but, uh...</i>

01:02:54.154 --> 01:02:55.921
I have it under
manageable control now.

01:02:55.956 --> 01:02:57.856
I don't even think
I'm going to take them

01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:59.591
<i>on the European tour.</i>

01:02:59.626 --> 01:03:01.426
Totally up to you.

01:03:01.461 --> 01:03:03.328
The body flushes it out.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:05.697
There are no studies
that show it's addicting.

01:03:05.732 --> 01:03:07.766
It's perfectly fine.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.735
You look terrific,
by the way.

01:03:13.305 --> 01:03:15.139
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:03:15.173 --> 01:03:16.741
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:03:16.775 --> 01:03:18.976
<i>How does he get that
whole thing down his throat?</i>

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:21.512
<i>It's bigger than his head!</i>

01:03:21.546 --> 01:03:23.514
<i>It's a freak show!</i>

01:03:23.548 --> 01:03:26.651
<i>I don't know how you
can be gay and be such a prude.</i>

01:03:26.685 --> 01:03:29.486
<i>I'm</i> bisexual.

01:03:30.688 --> 01:03:32.289
Well, which half
likes women?

01:03:32.323 --> 01:03:34.791
I haven't met
that half yet.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:37.526
You know, you're such
a booper.

01:03:37.561 --> 01:03:41.364
Such a party
pooper-booper.

01:03:41.398 --> 01:03:44.400
I don't even know
why you need that.

01:03:44.434 --> 01:03:46.301
I don't <i>need</i> it.

01:03:46.336 --> 01:03:49.405
I enjoy it.
It enhances it.

01:03:49.439 --> 01:03:53.208
Sexuality is
something beautiful.

01:03:53.243 --> 01:03:54.509
Right.
So how can you watch

01:03:54.543 --> 01:03:57.144
those disgusting things
being done?

01:03:57.179 --> 01:04:00.448
Disgusting is in the eyes
of the disgusting.

01:04:00.483 --> 01:04:03.451
There's nothing wrong with
any part of the human body.

01:04:03.486 --> 01:04:05.253
It's all
God's creation.

01:04:05.287 --> 01:04:08.923
Well, God didn't make certain
parts for certain things.

01:04:08.957 --> 01:04:10.524
It's variety, Scott.

01:04:10.558 --> 01:04:12.426
It's what keeps
a relationship fresh.

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:15.161
You know, you are
such a prude!

01:04:15.196 --> 01:04:16.563
I am not.

01:04:16.598 --> 01:04:19.165
Then why won't you let
me fuck <i>you</i> sometime?

01:04:23.104 --> 01:04:24.938
- Forget it.
- Why not?

01:04:24.972 --> 01:04:27.072
- Because I don't like it.
- Why?

01:04:27.107 --> 01:04:29.609
Because it's
kind of repugnant.

01:04:30.711 --> 01:04:32.912
<i>I'm</i> repugnant?

01:04:32.946 --> 01:04:34.847
No! Not you.

01:04:34.882 --> 01:04:36.482
It.

01:04:37.484 --> 01:04:39.251
That.
Doing that.

01:04:40.253 --> 01:04:42.987
Only when
it's done to <i>you.</i>

01:04:43.022 --> 01:04:44.289
Yes.

01:04:44.323 --> 01:04:45.924
I can't help it.

01:04:45.958 --> 01:04:47.893
- Well, you never tried it.
<i>- Oh, God!</i>

01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:50.261
Because I know
I wouldn't like it.

01:04:50.296 --> 01:04:52.397
If you loved me,
you'd try it.

01:04:52.432 --> 01:04:55.233
If you loved me, you wouldn't
ask me to do something I hate.

01:04:55.267 --> 01:04:56.501
Oh, God!

01:04:56.536 --> 01:04:57.968
All of a sudden
we're sounding like

01:04:58.002 --> 01:05:00.103
a gay Lucy and Ricky.

01:05:00.138 --> 01:05:02.239
"Oh, Ricky, you wouldn't
fuck me up the ass

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:03.674
<i>if you really loved me."</i>

01:05:03.708 --> 01:05:05.309
Why am I the Lucy?

01:05:05.343 --> 01:05:08.245
Because I'm
the bandleader

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:10.514
with the nightclub act.

01:05:19.723 --> 01:05:21.390
Hello.

01:05:23.026 --> 01:05:24.627
Hold on.

01:05:24.662 --> 01:05:26.863
It's your sister.

01:05:29.699 --> 01:05:32.133
Angie, what?

01:05:34.971 --> 01:05:37.072
When?

01:05:38.274 --> 01:05:41.343
Okay.

01:05:41.377 --> 01:05:44.546
Did you call...
what's his name?

01:05:46.381 --> 01:05:49.149
Okay. Okay.

01:05:49.184 --> 01:05:52.820
All right, let me
call Seymour on this.

01:05:52.855 --> 01:05:55.490
It'll be first thing
in the morning.

01:05:55.524 --> 01:05:57.257
Yeah.

01:05:57.292 --> 01:05:58.759
Okay.

01:06:04.665 --> 01:06:07.333
Lee, what?

01:06:09.203 --> 01:06:11.204
Mama died.

01:06:11.238 --> 01:06:13.573
Oh, no.

01:06:13.608 --> 01:06:15.575
Oh, no.

01:06:16.477 --> 01:06:18.878
Oh, Lee,
I'm so sorry.

01:06:56.447 --> 01:07:00.551
You have been amazing
these past few days.

01:07:00.585 --> 01:07:02.252
We haven't even had
a chance to talk.

01:07:02.286 --> 01:07:04.287
How are you
feeling?

01:07:07.024 --> 01:07:09.058
I'm free.

01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:18.300
<i>You're going to love this.</i>

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:21.170
- Mm-mm.
- Come on. Just this one time.

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:22.571
No, I don't
want to.

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.775
Pooch, pooch, pooch, come on.
Ride my little scooter!

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:28.610
You can ride my little scooter!

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:31.412
- Don't tickle me.
- Let's see.

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:32.747
Oh, daddy!

01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:12.651
Lee?

01:08:23.496 --> 01:08:25.897
Lee?

01:08:30.536 --> 01:08:32.636
Lee?

01:08:32.671 --> 01:08:35.640
<i>Someone's in here!
What the fuck?!</i>

01:08:57.795 --> 01:09:00.729
What are you doing?

01:09:28.024 --> 01:09:30.358
Why was I on
the couch?

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:33.828
Because I couldn't
bear you last night.

01:09:33.862 --> 01:09:35.328
And if you keep
taking that junk,

01:09:35.363 --> 01:09:37.165
you'll be lucky to stay
on the couch.

01:09:37.198 --> 01:09:40.334
- Well, about last night--
- I'm not ready for apologies yet, okay.

01:09:40.368 --> 01:09:42.703
Apology?
Fuck you!

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:47.540
You are
a well-known star.

01:09:47.575 --> 01:09:49.542
Are you out
of your mind?

01:09:49.577 --> 01:09:52.078
Going to a place
like that?

01:09:52.113 --> 01:09:54.748
What if somebody
recognized you...

01:09:54.782 --> 01:09:56.183
and called the papers?

01:09:56.217 --> 01:09:57.517
I mean, Jesus!

01:09:57.551 --> 01:09:59.186
When the London papers
said I was gay,

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:01.922
I took them to court
and won the lawsuit.

01:10:01.956 --> 01:10:04.323
They retracted the story
and they paid for it.

01:10:04.357 --> 01:10:05.891
Only because
they didn't have

01:10:05.926 --> 01:10:08.460
a witness of you
in a room of dildos...

01:10:08.494 --> 01:10:10.529
with your dick hanging out
in a glory hole.

01:10:10.563 --> 01:10:13.498
Are you out
of your fucking mind?!

01:10:13.533 --> 01:10:16.702
Jesus, if Seymour
found out.

01:10:16.737 --> 01:10:19.270
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>the millions he spends...</i>

01:10:19.304 --> 01:10:23.942
<i>keeping fans thinking you just
haven't met the right woman?</i>

01:10:23.976 --> 01:10:25.710
Oh, Scott,
you're right.

01:10:25.745 --> 01:10:28.479
You're so right--
I got to stop.

01:10:28.513 --> 01:10:31.282
Never again,
I promise, never again.

01:10:31.316 --> 01:10:35.085
I swear to God.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.987
You're so good for me.

01:10:37.021 --> 01:10:38.655
I don't know
what it is.

01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:40.523
I can't stop myself
sometimes.

01:10:40.558 --> 01:10:43.360
It's like a drug...
you know?

01:10:43.394 --> 01:10:46.996
Like when you need
a stronger fix each time?

01:10:48.298 --> 01:10:50.399
You have to help me.

01:10:52.102 --> 01:10:54.937
I'll do
whatever you want...

01:10:54.972 --> 01:10:56.438
you crazy
old queen.

01:10:58.275 --> 01:11:00.275
You know that.

01:11:00.309 --> 01:11:02.878
Just keep loving me.

01:11:05.614 --> 01:11:09.284
But I want you to stop
seeing Dr. Startz.

01:11:09.318 --> 01:11:11.619
<i>I mean it.</i>

01:11:32.206 --> 01:11:34.674
- The entrance? Showstopper.
- Thank you.

01:11:34.708 --> 01:11:36.142
Hello!

01:11:36.177 --> 01:11:37.944
Finally, you come
to one of my shows.

01:11:37.978 --> 01:11:40.213
No, I was here last year, remember?

01:11:40.247 --> 01:11:42.182
So, this is new,
right?

01:11:42.216 --> 01:11:44.083
I have new costumes
every year--

01:11:44.118 --> 01:11:46.252
it's in my contract.
You like it?

01:11:46.287 --> 01:11:47.720
You did it again.

01:11:47.754 --> 01:11:49.421
It just gets bigger
and bigger, right?

01:11:49.455 --> 01:11:52.324
One day, Lee, I think you're going
to play the piano while you fly.

01:11:52.358 --> 01:11:53.992
Ray's working
on that.

01:11:54.027 --> 01:11:56.295
- Scott, why don't you get him a drink?
- You heard the maestro.

01:11:56.329 --> 01:11:58.330
- Do your thing, Lee.
- <i>Bonjour!</i>

01:11:58.364 --> 01:12:01.300
<i>You guys, how did you</i>
<i>like the pool?</i>

01:12:01.334 --> 01:12:03.101
What would you like?

01:12:03.136 --> 01:12:05.803
The money you owe me from last
time and a Jim Beam neat.

01:12:05.838 --> 01:12:07.738
I don't have
any cash right now.

01:12:07.772 --> 01:12:10.908
<i>- Did you wear your little Speedos?</i>
- I did.

01:12:10.943 --> 01:12:13.444
I'll accept
whatever's handy, guy.

01:12:13.478 --> 01:12:16.914
<i>Did you notice
the "L" on the front?</i>

01:12:16.949 --> 01:12:19.283
It was missing an "A" on the back.

01:12:19.318 --> 01:12:20.550
You're cute.

01:12:20.584 --> 01:12:22.185
- <i>You are very cute.</i>
- <i>Stop.</i>

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.786
<i>I like that.</i>

01:12:52.848 --> 01:12:55.649
<i>So, how is
the songwriting going?</i>

01:12:55.684 --> 01:12:57.618
Good.

01:12:57.652 --> 01:13:00.188
I had some
positive feedback.

01:13:00.222 --> 01:13:02.423
When are you going to let me
hear one of your songs?

01:13:02.457 --> 01:13:04.926
- I don't know.
- Why?

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.328
'Cause I'm afraid
you wouldn't like it.

01:13:07.363 --> 01:13:09.296
But I'm proud
of what you're doing!

01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:10.931
I'm like a proud papa!

01:13:10.965 --> 01:13:14.801
I think it's great!

01:13:14.835 --> 01:13:16.904
Maybe when I'm done with
this one, you can hear it.

01:13:16.938 --> 01:13:19.239
Whenever you want me
to hear.

01:13:31.251 --> 01:13:33.653
Scott, we should talk.

01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:37.457
I think
our relationship

01:13:37.491 --> 01:13:39.893
is in a really
good place, don't you?

01:13:39.927 --> 01:13:42.861
- Mm-hmm.
- I do.

01:13:42.896 --> 01:13:45.931
So I think it'd be
a good thing for us...

01:13:45.965 --> 01:13:48.700
if we were able to see
other people, too.

01:13:48.735 --> 01:13:50.936
I don't mean
like you and me.

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:54.506
I mean, nothing
will ever be like us.

01:13:54.541 --> 01:13:57.942
I just know there are things that
I like to do that you don't...

01:13:57.976 --> 01:14:00.645
and things that you like
to do that I don't.

01:14:00.679 --> 01:14:03.347
And I just think that
we're in such a good place

01:14:03.381 --> 01:14:07.485
that we can allow each other...
you know, to do that

01:14:07.519 --> 01:14:12.156
and still love each other
and stay together.

01:14:13.424 --> 01:14:15.826
What do you think?

01:14:17.428 --> 01:14:20.831
Okay. You know,
if that's what you want.

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:24.367
I think it'd be
good for us.

01:14:24.401 --> 01:14:26.670
I really do.

01:14:26.704 --> 01:14:29.872
Lee, he is
just a friend!

01:14:29.906 --> 01:14:31.574
He is helping me
with my songs!

01:14:31.608 --> 01:14:33.141
I told you I had
meetings with him!

01:14:33.176 --> 01:14:34.376
You're just like
the rest of them.

01:14:34.410 --> 01:14:36.645
All I do is give
and give and give.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.081
All you want is what
you can get out of me.

01:14:39.115 --> 01:14:41.016
I bet you can't
wait for me to die

01:14:41.050 --> 01:14:42.384
so you can
get everything!

01:14:42.418 --> 01:14:45.219
- <i>Hey, the will was your idea!</i>
- Jekyll and Hyde!

01:14:45.253 --> 01:14:46.554
That's what you are!

01:14:46.589 --> 01:14:48.756
I never know
who's going to show up!

01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:51.158
God knows what you do
when I'm onstage.

01:14:51.193 --> 01:14:53.695
- <i>I don't do anything!</i>
- How many others are there, huh?

01:14:53.729 --> 01:14:56.731
- How many?!
- <i>There aren't any others, Lee, I'm telling you!</i>

01:14:56.765 --> 01:15:00.067
Well, I'm telling <i>you,</i>
you can't have it all.

01:15:00.102 --> 01:15:02.903
It's either me
or nothing.

01:15:02.937 --> 01:15:04.938
Me or him.

01:15:04.973 --> 01:15:07.708
Who?
He's a friend!

01:15:07.742 --> 01:15:09.442
He's a fuck buddy!

01:15:09.477 --> 01:15:13.046
If anybody's
fucking around, it's you.

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.082
I know you, Lee. You haven't
wanted it from me in weeks.

01:15:16.117 --> 01:15:17.783
Don't tell me
<i>you've</i> been doing without,

01:15:17.818 --> 01:15:19.719
you old queen.

01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:26.926
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

01:15:36.502 --> 01:15:38.703
<i>...people out here, and
it seems a bit out of control.</i>

01:15:38.738 --> 01:15:41.006
Where's Lee?

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.607
Have a couple of guys
come help with security,

01:15:42.642 --> 01:15:45.143
<i>wait on the stairs at night,
just to stop the crowds.</i>

01:15:45.177 --> 01:15:48.547
- <i>Otherwise...</i>
- Hey, Jim, how's the house tonight?

01:15:59.724 --> 01:16:03.094
<i>♪ Every

01:16:03.128 --> 01:16:06.463

01:16:53.408 --> 01:16:56.176
to be on the Academy Awards,
and finally I am.

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:57.677
Isn't that fabulous?

01:16:57.712 --> 01:17:00.046
I'm going to play a medley
of the nominated scores

01:17:00.081 --> 01:17:03.083
and then present
the award for Best Score.

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:06.587
Just to be able to hold one
of those gold statues.

01:17:06.621 --> 01:17:09.055
I know exactly
what I'm going to wear.

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:11.157
Cary, do me a favor.
Can you get me a towel?

01:17:11.191 --> 01:17:12.825
Of course,
of course.

01:17:12.859 --> 01:17:16.061
I want to hear about that
outfit when I come back.

01:17:48.293 --> 01:17:51.061
Who are you
talking to, Mumbles?

01:17:54.732 --> 01:17:56.833
Nobody.

01:18:00.237 --> 01:18:02.338
What's the matter?

01:18:05.276 --> 01:18:08.010
Why is he always
hanging around?

01:18:08.879 --> 01:18:11.648
Who?

01:18:11.682 --> 01:18:14.049
<i>Who?</i>

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:16.518
Who?

01:18:17.853 --> 01:18:19.988
That boy that
you want to fuck

01:18:20.022 --> 01:18:22.457
<i>from Young Americans.</i>

01:18:22.492 --> 01:18:24.359
Oh, please.

01:18:24.394 --> 01:18:25.561
Oh, please.

01:18:25.595 --> 01:18:28.463
Why is that little bitch
always in our dressing room?

01:18:29.731 --> 01:18:33.067
Cary is my opening act,
Scott.

01:18:33.101 --> 01:18:36.237
He can come and go
as he pleases.

01:18:40.409 --> 01:18:42.042
Are you fucking him?

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.145
Are you stoned?

01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.980
No, I'm upset!

01:18:48.015 --> 01:18:49.416
Can't you tell
the difference?

01:18:49.450 --> 01:18:51.818
No, I can't. But if
you're on that shit--

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.653
- I'm warning you...
- I'm not! I'm <i>upset!</i>

01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:55.689
- I will not put up with this anymore.
- Don't change the subject!

01:18:55.723 --> 01:18:57.424
- Stop that! Stop it!
- <i>I know you, Lee!</i>

01:18:57.458 --> 01:18:59.859
<i>I'm exhausted!</i>

01:19:01.394 --> 01:19:03.862
I work, you know?

01:19:03.896 --> 01:19:06.332
And I have to meet Seymour
very early in the morning

01:19:06.366 --> 01:19:09.268
about the Academy Awards
presentation.

01:19:14.374 --> 01:19:17.442
I see you
looking at him.

01:19:17.476 --> 01:19:19.410
<i>What?</i>

01:19:19.445 --> 01:19:22.213
That boy.

01:19:22.248 --> 01:19:23.848
I watch you watch him.

01:19:23.882 --> 01:19:26.684
I think he's
very talented.

01:19:26.719 --> 01:19:29.019
I have an eye for new
and refreshing talent.

01:19:29.054 --> 01:19:31.155
You have an eye for new
and refreshing dick.

01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:33.557
You're disgusting.

01:19:33.591 --> 01:19:36.126
<i>If you're so interested</i>
<i>in talent...</i>

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.730
<i>have you listened</i>
<i>to my songs?</i>

01:19:39.764 --> 01:19:43.533
I haven't had a chance
to give it my full attention.

01:19:44.736 --> 01:19:47.003
<i>Are you</i>
<i>tired of me?</i>

01:19:47.037 --> 01:19:49.205
<i>Am I too old</i>
<i>for you?</i>

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:50.640
Well, this song
you're singing

01:19:50.674 --> 01:19:53.008
is beginning to get
a little old.

01:19:58.081 --> 01:20:01.116
I don't want him around
after the shows anymore.

01:20:01.151 --> 01:20:03.386
What a little brat
you've become.

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:05.500
I thought you liked being
around people your own age.

01:20:05.521 --> 01:20:07.889
You're always complaining we're
never with anyone else, you know?

01:20:07.923 --> 01:20:10.224
<i>You said we weren't doing the "seeing
other people" thing anymore!</i>

01:20:10.259 --> 01:20:13.561
- We're not!
- Then how come we haven't been together for so long?

01:20:13.596 --> 01:20:16.731
Because you're always stoned
and you can't get it up!

01:20:16.766 --> 01:20:17.965
I can get it up!

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.834
- Oh, Christ, I hit a nerve.
- I can get it up!!!

01:20:19.868 --> 01:20:22.369
- All right, all right!
- I know you!

01:20:22.404 --> 01:20:25.272
You can barely make it through a
performance without wanting to fuck!

01:20:25.307 --> 01:20:27.140
- Where do you get it?
- It's terrible the way you talk to me!

01:20:27.175 --> 01:20:28.275
You're getting it
on the outside!

01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:29.710
- Where do you go?
- You're terrible!

01:20:29.744 --> 01:20:31.445
- Do you go to the White House?
- Where my mother died?

01:20:31.479 --> 01:20:33.814
- Are you insane?
- Oh, so you do go somewhere.

01:20:33.848 --> 01:20:35.482
Where, huh?

01:20:35.517 --> 01:20:37.850
Where, Lee?!

01:20:37.884 --> 01:20:40.152
You're being
paranoid, Scott,

01:20:40.187 --> 01:20:41.854
because of that shit.

01:20:41.888 --> 01:20:45.457
Now, I am warning you...
this better stop.

01:20:50.062 --> 01:20:52.331
<i>So who's doing the
arrangements for the medley?</i>

01:20:52.365 --> 01:20:56.201
I'll find out. Probably
Bill or his assistant.

01:20:56.235 --> 01:20:58.704
I bet that Vangelis kid
wins, you know?

01:20:58.738 --> 01:21:00.971
I'm hearing him
all over the radio.

01:21:15.454 --> 01:21:17.887
I'm going to L.A.
for the afternoon.

01:21:23.293 --> 01:21:26.329
I'll be back in time
for the show.

01:21:35.605 --> 01:21:39.241
I just want to make sure I
have enough rehearsal time.

01:22:01.864 --> 01:22:04.064
And now he's going to use me,

01:22:04.099 --> 01:22:05.699
use me up
and toss me out,

01:22:05.733 --> 01:22:08.635
I know he is,
I know he is.

01:22:08.669 --> 01:22:10.103
<i>This one's rigged.</i>

01:22:10.137 --> 01:22:12.839
- I love him, you know?
- <i>That one's not rigged.</i>

01:22:12.874 --> 01:22:14.441
I love him.

01:22:14.475 --> 01:22:16.676
I mean...

01:22:16.711 --> 01:22:19.546
he's been my whole world.

01:22:20.814 --> 01:22:23.549
He's my,
he's my best friend.

01:22:23.583 --> 01:22:26.285
He's been better,
better than a father.

01:22:27.454 --> 01:22:28.721
He was going to adopt me.
You know that?

01:22:28.755 --> 01:22:30.456
<i>Really? You can adopt</i>
<i>someone you're fucking?</i>

01:22:30.490 --> 01:22:32.124
<i>That's a great law.</i>

01:22:32.158 --> 01:22:33.459
He said he always wanted
to make sure

01:22:33.493 --> 01:22:35.895
- that I was taken care of.
- <i>Right.</i>

01:22:35.929 --> 01:22:38.062
<i>Look, you're practically
married, right?</i>

01:22:38.096 --> 01:22:40.765
Nobody ever took care of me
the way he did.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:44.803
I have nothing
without him.

01:22:44.837 --> 01:22:46.504
I don't even have
my own fucking face!

01:22:46.539 --> 01:22:48.406
My fucking face
is fucking gone

01:22:48.441 --> 01:22:49.741
for-fucking-ever, man!!

01:22:49.775 --> 01:22:52.543
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>
Tranquilo, <i>okay?</i>

01:22:52.577 --> 01:22:54.277
<i>Calm down.</i>

01:22:54.312 --> 01:22:56.713
<i>Look at me. You're
practically married, right?</i>

01:22:56.748 --> 01:22:58.214
<i>So, he should</i>
<i>take care of you</i>

01:22:58.249 --> 01:23:00.016
<i>in the style to which</i>
<i>you are accustomed.</i>

01:23:00.051 --> 01:23:01.251
<i>That's a law, too.</i>

01:23:01.285 --> 01:23:03.019
I'm in the will,
but...

01:23:03.054 --> 01:23:05.288
a lot of good
that does me now.

01:23:05.323 --> 01:23:07.458
<i>Being with him's like</i>
<i>a full-time job, correct?</i>

01:23:07.492 --> 01:23:10.893
- 25 hours a day.
- <i>Yeah. So three words:</i>

01:23:10.928 --> 01:23:12.394
<i>Sev-er-ance,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

01:23:12.429 --> 01:23:15.164
<i>People who get fired</i>
<i>get compensated.</i>

01:23:22.072 --> 01:23:25.006
He's my whole world.

01:24:00.941 --> 01:24:02.408
There you are,

01:24:02.442 --> 01:24:06.913
you cocksucking
tenor fuck.

01:24:10.183 --> 01:24:11.985
There's a call
for you.

01:24:12.019 --> 01:24:14.185
Joe Carracappa.

01:24:21.895 --> 01:24:23.428
- Joe!
- <i>Hey, Scott.</i>

01:24:23.462 --> 01:24:24.622
Hey, I'm sorry,
I have to run.

01:24:24.631 --> 01:24:25.998
I have to make
an entrance.

01:24:26.032 --> 01:24:29.600
Rose... passed away
this morning, Scott.

01:24:31.937 --> 01:24:33.470
What?

01:24:33.505 --> 01:24:37.742
- She's been sick.
- <i>For how long?</i>

01:24:37.776 --> 01:24:39.276
A while.

01:24:39.310 --> 01:24:41.378
She never said
anything to me.

01:24:41.413 --> 01:24:45.081
<i>You know</i>
<i>how she is.</i>

01:24:45.115 --> 01:24:47.751
Was.

01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:52.088
Can you come home, Scott?
It'd be good to see you.

01:24:52.122 --> 01:24:55.458
<i>We're having</i>
<i>services.</i>

01:24:58.295 --> 01:25:00.596
Yeah.

01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:02.932
Yeah, of course.

01:25:02.966 --> 01:25:04.499
<i>I am so excited.</i>

01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:07.436
The Academy Awards
has been a dream of mine.

01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:09.972
That and Radio City
Music Hall.

01:25:10.006 --> 01:25:11.840
One down, one to go.

01:25:13.342 --> 01:25:15.310
My mom wants "On Golden
Pond" to win everything.

01:25:15.344 --> 01:25:16.811
Yes, wouldn't
that be sweet

01:25:16.845 --> 01:25:18.512
for the old folks
to win?

01:25:18.547 --> 01:25:22.850
And I'm so glad that Jane Fonda
stopped all those causes of hers

01:25:22.885 --> 01:25:25.853
and made a nice movie
with her father.

01:25:25.888 --> 01:25:29.123
I just don't understand
people like her and Ed Asner,

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:32.893
shouting their opinions
all over the place.

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:36.697
Listen to me, because
you're all on your way.

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:39.232
When one reaches
star status,

01:25:39.266 --> 01:25:41.935
it is not an invitation
to show everyone

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.904
how to change
the world.

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:47.808
It is not our business
to change the world.

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:50.509
We are here to
entertain the world...

01:25:50.543 --> 01:25:53.879
and to sell drinks and souvenirs.

01:25:53.914 --> 01:25:56.048
These kids better go
get ready for the next show

01:25:56.083 --> 01:25:57.817
if they're going to
entertain anybody.

01:25:57.851 --> 01:25:59.518
Will you watch us tonight?

01:25:59.552 --> 01:26:00.953
We put a new song in
just for you.

01:26:00.988 --> 01:26:04.356
Of course I will! Especially if
you put in a new song for <i>me.</i>

01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:06.190
Go on now.

01:26:06.225 --> 01:26:08.459
I'm going to get
my beauty nap.

01:26:21.039 --> 01:26:24.608
- Lee.
- Please, do not start an argument.

01:26:24.643 --> 01:26:27.611
I have to eat, and take
my nap before the next show.

01:26:27.646 --> 01:26:29.880
I have no time.

01:26:38.689 --> 01:26:40.556
I got a call today...

01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:44.460
from Joe Carracappa.

01:26:45.696 --> 01:26:49.465
The family that I lived
with when I met you.

01:26:51.268 --> 01:26:53.702
And Rose...

01:26:53.736 --> 01:26:56.271
my--

01:26:56.305 --> 01:26:59.340
Joe's wife.

01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:01.209
She died.

01:27:05.514 --> 01:27:08.216
Oh, Scott,
I...

01:27:08.250 --> 01:27:10.051
I'm so sorry,
Scott.

01:27:10.085 --> 01:27:14.521
She was your favorite,
wasn't she?

01:27:14.556 --> 01:27:19.526
There is a funeral
tomorrow... in Los Angeles.

01:27:19.561 --> 01:27:21.595
I will be booking
a ticket in the morning.

01:27:21.629 --> 01:27:24.598
- No, no, no, no.
- I don't know what time I'm going to get back.

01:27:24.632 --> 01:27:27.133
I'll call Seymour
in the morning, okay?

01:27:27.168 --> 01:27:31.604
And I'll hire a Learjet
and you can take that.

01:27:31.638 --> 01:27:34.007
And this way
it'll be more private

01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:37.610
and you won't have to worry
about reservations.

01:27:37.644 --> 01:27:42.347
You come back any time
that you're ready tomorrow.

01:27:47.987 --> 01:27:50.155
Come on, now.

01:27:54.761 --> 01:27:58.863
It's just been so long since
we've been nice to each other...

01:27:58.897 --> 01:28:02.100
and I was forgetting
what it felt like.

01:28:05.337 --> 01:28:10.007
Well, let's just keep being
nice to each other, hmm?

01:28:10.042 --> 01:28:12.009
How about that?

01:28:48.443 --> 01:28:50.444
Hi, Gladys.

01:28:54.049 --> 01:28:56.517
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, kid.</i>

01:28:56.551 --> 01:28:58.019
I didn't know
you were visiting.

01:28:58.053 --> 01:29:00.288
Lee invited me for the day.
I heard about Rose.

01:29:00.322 --> 01:29:01.688
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

01:29:01.722 --> 01:29:03.824
Thanks.

01:29:03.858 --> 01:29:05.926
Where's Lee?

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:08.929
He has his final fitting
for the Oscars.

01:29:08.963 --> 01:29:12.399
Come out by the pool
when you've settled in.

01:29:13.268 --> 01:29:15.002
Hey, Bob?

01:29:16.204 --> 01:29:18.771
- What's going on?
- What?

01:29:18.806 --> 01:29:21.707
It just
feels weird.

01:29:21.741 --> 01:29:23.976
Is there something
I don't know about?

01:29:27.414 --> 01:29:29.415
Well...

01:29:32.119 --> 01:29:33.985
yeah.

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.922
Yeah.

01:29:36.956 --> 01:29:41.259
Last night... you know,
the kid that he... Right?

01:29:44.063 --> 01:29:46.064
Cary, I think his...

01:30:55.897 --> 01:30:58.631
We should move you to the Palm
Springs house this afternoon.

01:31:00.434 --> 01:31:02.667
Let's wait
in the den.

01:31:27.259 --> 01:31:29.994
- I'm not calling him.
- So don't.

01:31:33.031 --> 01:31:34.464
I mean,
he's in the wrong.

01:31:34.498 --> 01:31:36.900
He should call me
and apologize to <i>me.</i>

01:31:36.935 --> 01:31:38.701
<i>He</i> fooled around
on <i>you.</i>

01:31:38.736 --> 01:31:40.437
I mean, who's the injured
party here, guy?

01:31:42.006 --> 01:31:44.174
I'm not calling him.

01:31:44.208 --> 01:31:45.842
So if his phone
doesn't ring,

01:31:45.876 --> 01:31:47.344
it's probably you.

01:31:47.378 --> 01:31:49.011
It's the only way
men learn.

01:31:49.046 --> 01:31:50.646
Tell me.

01:31:51.915 --> 01:31:55.051
- I am <i>not</i> calling him.
- So don't.

01:31:55.085 --> 01:31:58.321
You scumbag,
piece of shit...

01:31:58.355 --> 01:32:00.722
fairy, fucking queen
cocksucker!

01:32:00.757 --> 01:32:02.758
<i>- That's what I'm talking about!</i>
<i>- How dare you!</i>

01:32:02.792 --> 01:32:05.393
<i>- Fucking A!</i>
<i>- How fucking dare you, Lee! I could kill you!</i>

01:32:05.428 --> 01:32:08.330
- <i>I could fucking kill you!</i>
<i>- Yeah, put that in your pipe and smoke it, baby.</i>

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.834
He hung up.

01:32:12.868 --> 01:32:14.269
Whoo!

01:32:14.303 --> 01:32:16.871
Oh.

01:32:20.509 --> 01:32:22.409
Mr. Schnelker.

01:32:22.444 --> 01:32:24.678
This is Scott Thorson's
brother, Wayne.

01:32:24.712 --> 01:32:26.180
<i>Half-brother.</i>

01:32:26.214 --> 01:32:27.881
He's here
to help us.

01:32:27.915 --> 01:32:29.683
Now as I said
on the phone,

01:32:29.717 --> 01:32:31.718
Lee wants you to inform
Mr. Scott Thorson

01:32:31.752 --> 01:32:33.420
his employment
has been terminated

01:32:33.455 --> 01:32:36.090
and he must vacate
the apartment immediately.

01:32:36.124 --> 01:32:37.890
Also, if possible,

01:32:37.924 --> 01:32:39.892
we'd like you to convince
Scott to admit himself

01:32:39.926 --> 01:32:41.794
to a hospital
for treatment,

01:32:41.828 --> 01:32:43.429
at our expense.

01:32:43.464 --> 01:32:44.630
<i>Dorothy, June.</i>

01:32:44.664 --> 01:32:47.300
Mr. Heller.
He's on the couch.

01:32:47.334 --> 01:32:49.702
Stay by the elevator.
Wayne?

01:32:52.639 --> 01:32:54.406
Scott?

01:32:56.409 --> 01:32:57.876
Scott?

01:32:59.879 --> 01:33:02.447
Scott?

01:33:02.482 --> 01:33:04.549
This is Tracy.

01:33:04.583 --> 01:33:06.385
A private investigator.

01:33:06.419 --> 01:33:08.987
He's come
to ask you to leave.

01:33:11.523 --> 01:33:13.824
Get out of my house!

01:33:13.858 --> 01:33:15.959
Get out of my house!

01:33:15.994 --> 01:33:19.630
<i>- I only came to help.</i>
- I'm going to fucking get you out.

01:33:27.438 --> 01:33:29.572
- He's going to get a gun!
- Has he got a gun?

01:33:29.606 --> 01:33:32.375
- He has two.
- Don't let him get the guns.

01:33:32.410 --> 01:33:34.044
Let's go, brother.

01:33:37.214 --> 01:33:38.814
Stay back!

01:33:38.849 --> 01:33:40.517
Stay back,
don't you come in here!

01:33:40.551 --> 01:33:43.519
I'm calling the police!
I'm calling the police!

01:33:43.553 --> 01:33:45.687
- Back off!
- Fine.

01:33:45.721 --> 01:33:48.057
I wish you would
call the police.

01:33:48.091 --> 01:33:50.192
Scott, if you would take
advantage of our assistance,

01:33:50.226 --> 01:33:52.961
I'd be happy to call a
doctor and we can help you.

01:33:52.995 --> 01:33:55.164
Just fucking
shut up!

01:33:55.198 --> 01:33:56.965
- Do you want me to help you?
- Shut up!

01:33:56.999 --> 01:34:00.168
Back off!
I will fucking hit you!

01:34:01.037 --> 01:34:02.571
Hello, hello?
Hello.

01:34:02.605 --> 01:34:06.007
Yes,
I want the, uh...

01:34:06.042 --> 01:34:08.076
- I want the...
<i>- Scott.</i>

01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:10.445
- Who the fuck is this?
- <i>Scott.</i>

01:34:10.479 --> 01:34:11.913
Fucking don't!

01:34:11.948 --> 01:34:14.815
I will call the fucking Mafia,
and they will come here

01:34:14.849 --> 01:34:17.551
and bring you to the desert
and fucking bury you!

01:34:17.586 --> 01:34:20.220
Stay back!

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:29.096
<i>Scott!</i>

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:30.630
<i>Scott!</i>

01:34:30.664 --> 01:34:31.931
I want to talk to Lee!

01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:41.174
<i>I want to talk to Lee.</i>

01:34:41.209 --> 01:34:43.376
That's not
going to happen, Scott.

01:34:46.179 --> 01:34:47.613
You know what?
Fine.

01:34:47.647 --> 01:34:50.983
If this is how he wants to
handle this kind of situation...

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:54.120
then I <i>want</i> to leave.

01:34:55.622 --> 01:34:58.023
<i>But I am taking all of my
personal belongings with me.</i>

01:34:58.057 --> 01:35:01.127
<i>All of them, Seymour,</i>
<i>or I will fucking sue you!</i>

01:35:01.161 --> 01:35:04.729
Listen.
You have my word.

01:35:04.763 --> 01:35:06.897
If you vacate
the apartment now,

01:35:06.932 --> 01:35:09.267
you can come back
during the Academy Awards...

01:35:09.301 --> 01:35:12.637
and I'll have all your belongings
ready for you to pick up.

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.874
<i>Wow.</i>

01:35:16.908 --> 01:35:19.643
Stick it in
and break it off, huh?

01:35:26.351 --> 01:35:29.052
<i>From the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion</i>

01:35:29.086 --> 01:35:31.321
<i>in Los Angeles,</i>
<i>California...</i>

01:35:31.356 --> 01:35:32.422
Wow.

01:35:32.457 --> 01:35:36.359
<i>The 54th annual</i>
<i>Academy Awards!</i>

01:35:44.334 --> 01:35:45.968
Wow.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.102
Actually, though, it's
kind of a cokey piano.

01:36:41.387 --> 01:36:42.954
<i>Is it true
that you and Liberace</i>

01:36:42.988 --> 01:36:45.357
<i>made an oral agreement when you
first went to work for him</i>

01:36:45.391 --> 01:36:48.560
- <i>and moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:36:48.595 --> 01:36:50.429
You contend that
at some later date

01:36:50.463 --> 01:36:51.963
after making
that oral agreement,

01:36:51.997 --> 01:36:54.099
the oral agreement was put
into a written agreement

01:36:54.133 --> 01:36:56.467
- prepared by attorney Joel Strote?
- Yes.

01:36:56.501 --> 01:36:59.770
- Where he made certain promises to you.
- Yes.

01:36:59.804 --> 01:37:02.340
- <i>Did you ever sign that written agreement?</i>
- Yes, I did.

01:37:02.374 --> 01:37:05.676
- <i>Did Liberace ever sign that written agreement?</i>
- Yes.

01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:07.378
<i>Did you ever receive</i>
<i>a copy of it?</i>

01:37:07.412 --> 01:37:10.413
Joel Strote
has my copy.

01:37:10.448 --> 01:37:14.417
<i>Was there ever any other written
agreement between you and Liberace</i>

01:37:14.452 --> 01:37:16.819
<i>other than this one</i>
<i>prepared by Joel Strote?</i>

01:37:16.854 --> 01:37:19.822
Yes. The will.
My will.

01:37:19.857 --> 01:37:23.660
- Did you ever execute this will?
- Yes.

01:37:23.694 --> 01:37:26.695
Did anyone witness
your executed will?

01:37:27.764 --> 01:37:30.065
When you mean
"executed", uh...

01:37:30.099 --> 01:37:32.368
I didn't
sign it yet.

01:37:32.402 --> 01:37:36.739
- I mean--
- He doesn't understand "executed" to mean signing.

01:37:36.773 --> 01:37:39.107
<i>What did you mean</i>
<i>when you said "executed"?</i>

01:37:39.142 --> 01:37:41.076
Well, you mean,
did I ever sign it?

01:37:41.110 --> 01:37:43.311
No, I never did.
No.

01:37:43.345 --> 01:37:45.413
Why didn't you
ever sign it?

01:37:45.447 --> 01:37:49.317
Because Liberace and I
were having problems.

01:37:49.351 --> 01:37:52.119
What kind of problems?

01:37:52.154 --> 01:37:54.689
I felt that he was
seeing other people.

01:37:55.891 --> 01:37:59.159
Did you ever receive
a copy of this will?

01:37:59.193 --> 01:38:02.896
<i>Joel Strote</i>
<i>kept my copy for me.</i>

01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:05.031
<i>Was it your expectation
that you would become</i>

01:38:05.065 --> 01:38:08.302
- <i>the legally adopted son of Liberace?</i>
- Yes.

01:38:08.336 --> 01:38:10.504
<i>And continue in a sexual</i>
<i>relationship with him</i>

01:38:10.538 --> 01:38:13.373
- <i>after the adoption?</i>
- No.

01:38:13.408 --> 01:38:16.108
<i>Is that when you thought</i>
<i>the sex would stop?</i>

01:38:17.210 --> 01:38:19.312
Our relationship
towards later on

01:38:19.346 --> 01:38:22.748
went from a sexual
relationship to...

01:38:22.783 --> 01:38:25.718
Lee always thought of me
as more of a son.

01:38:25.752 --> 01:38:27.687
We had our
sexual relationship

01:38:27.721 --> 01:38:29.188
in the beginning
of our relationship

01:38:29.222 --> 01:38:32.290
and it was, more or less,
he thought of me as a--

01:38:32.325 --> 01:38:35.727
He wanted me to think of him
as a, as a father type image.

01:38:35.761 --> 01:38:39.698
He thought--
It's just so hard to explain.

01:38:39.732 --> 01:38:41.499
<i>His duties were expanded</i>

01:38:41.534 --> 01:38:44.969
<i>to be a road manager,</i>
<i>acting as a buffer for me...</i>

01:38:45.003 --> 01:38:49.707
you know, for various employees
in various hotels...

01:38:49.741 --> 01:38:53.009
the fans, media,
answering the phone...

01:38:53.044 --> 01:38:56.146
answering knocks
on the door...

01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:58.682
driving me from places
of engagement

01:38:58.717 --> 01:39:01.819
where limousines
were not provided for me.

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:04.320
<i>Did you make a
gift of three bedroom sets</i>

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:07.089
- <i>to Scott Thorson?</i>
- No.

01:39:07.123 --> 01:39:09.559
<i>Did you make a gift of lamps</i>
<i>to Scott Thorson?</i>

01:39:09.593 --> 01:39:10.860
No.

01:39:10.894 --> 01:39:13.396
<i>Did you make a gift</i>
<i>of a water buffalo head,</i>

01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:17.066
- mounted, to Scott Thorson?
- No.

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.734
Did you make a gift
of any furniture

01:39:18.768 --> 01:39:22.537
- to Scott Thorson?
- <i>No.</i>

01:39:22.572 --> 01:39:24.806
What reason do you have
for believing that

01:39:24.841 --> 01:39:26.941
the furniture and furnishings
you think of as gifts

01:39:26.976 --> 01:39:28.744
were, in fact,
not gifts?

01:39:28.778 --> 01:39:31.012
Well, this is what I do
with all my homes.

01:39:31.046 --> 01:39:34.182
I furnish all my homes
for people to use.

01:39:34.216 --> 01:39:36.450
But that does not mean
they can take the furniture

01:39:36.485 --> 01:39:38.051
with them
when they leave.

01:39:38.086 --> 01:39:40.721
It's my property.

01:39:40.756 --> 01:39:43.758
Did you make a gift of any
furs to Scott Thorson?

01:39:43.792 --> 01:39:46.260
- <i>Yes.</i>
- What furs?

01:39:46.294 --> 01:39:51.063
<i>Uh, a raccoon,</i>
<i>a black mink trenchcoat,</i>

01:39:51.098 --> 01:39:54.467
<i>a leather</i>
<i>and black mink coat...</i>

01:39:54.502 --> 01:39:57.670
<i>and um, that's it.</i>

01:39:57.705 --> 01:40:01.007
And what other gifts have
you made to Scott Thorson?

01:40:01.041 --> 01:40:02.809
<i>Jewelry.</i>

01:40:03.677 --> 01:40:05.077
<i>What form of jewelry?</i>

01:40:05.112 --> 01:40:07.946
A ring with
his initial on it...

01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:11.784
and two Krugerrands
made up the ring.

01:40:12.852 --> 01:40:15.253
Gold chains.

01:40:15.288 --> 01:40:19.391
Australian opal ring.

01:40:19.426 --> 01:40:21.660
Bracelets,
things like that.

01:40:21.694 --> 01:40:24.896
<i>Okay, first off, you
have to understand something.</i>

01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:26.697
<i>You're not getting</i>
<i>any of your property back.</i>

01:40:26.732 --> 01:40:27.965
<i>You're not getting a dime...</i>

01:40:27.999 --> 01:40:29.767
unless you sign
this agreement.

01:40:29.802 --> 01:40:31.436
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:33.237
All right.

01:40:33.271 --> 01:40:35.406
You're going to get
$75,000 in cash,

01:40:35.441 --> 01:40:37.241
three of your cars,
three dogs

01:40:37.275 --> 01:40:38.675
and all
your clothes.

01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:40.477
$75,000?
That's it?

01:40:40.511 --> 01:40:42.345
In return for the
money, the cars,

01:40:42.379 --> 01:40:44.080
the dogs and the
personal property...

01:40:44.114 --> 01:40:45.415
you're going to
sign over the title

01:40:45.449 --> 01:40:47.349
of your Las Vegas home
on Laramore to Lee.

01:40:47.383 --> 01:40:49.819
And that's estimated value
right now at $200,000.

01:40:49.853 --> 01:40:52.120
You're going to give over
all the <i>contents</i> to Lee,

01:40:52.155 --> 01:40:54.189
estimated at $50,000.

01:40:54.223 --> 01:40:56.291
In addition,
you will be required

01:40:56.326 --> 01:40:59.595
to sign over the titles
of your Chevrolet van,

01:40:59.629 --> 01:41:01.696
the antique Cadillac
and your Auburn

01:41:01.730 --> 01:41:03.364
to Mr. Liberace.

01:41:03.398 --> 01:41:04.966
You will also give up
any other claims

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:08.069
against Mr. Liberace
of any kind in the future.

01:41:08.103 --> 01:41:12.306
So assault, battery,
palimony-- out.

01:41:12.341 --> 01:41:15.042
And you're going to sign
a clause prohibiting you

01:41:15.077 --> 01:41:17.478
from revealing the true
nature of your relationship

01:41:17.512 --> 01:41:18.745
to anybody,
public or private.

01:41:18.780 --> 01:41:20.080
This is the best
we could do?

01:41:20.114 --> 01:41:24.585
They're shortchanging
me $250,000.

01:41:24.619 --> 01:41:27.153
Well, there's nothing in here
about the jewelry he gave you,

01:41:27.188 --> 01:41:28.889
- so you get to keep that.
- I had to sell the jewelry!

01:41:28.923 --> 01:41:33.026
- For what?
- For legal, uh, fees and other things.

01:41:34.828 --> 01:41:37.830
I don't care...
what the judge says,

01:41:37.865 --> 01:41:39.599
we were
fucking married!

01:41:39.633 --> 01:41:42.568
Well, the law says
you weren't.

01:41:42.603 --> 01:41:45.805
And a contract for sex
can't be enforced.

01:41:45.839 --> 01:41:49.375
Scott, listen to me.
You're a drug addict.

01:41:49.409 --> 01:41:51.442
<i>This is all</i>
<i>you're getting.</i>

01:41:51.477 --> 01:41:53.344
<i>Sign it.</i>

01:41:55.681 --> 01:41:57.448
You know, I called
Billy Leatherwood.

01:41:57.483 --> 01:41:59.250
He got more.

01:42:09.293 --> 01:42:11.261

01:48:04.561 --> 01:48:06.528
has rejected
the death certificate...

01:48:06.563 --> 01:48:09.531
by Liberace's attending
doctor, Ronald Daniels,

01:48:09.566 --> 01:48:10.932
and has ordered
an autopsy.

01:48:10.967 --> 01:48:15.336
This request
is unseemly.

01:48:15.371 --> 01:48:17.805
Mr. Liberace died
of heart failure...

01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.308
due to an anemia caused
by a watermelon diet.

01:48:21.343 --> 01:48:24.545
The body has already
been embalmed!

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:27.849
With respect to Liberace's
family during this time,

01:48:27.883 --> 01:48:31.284
we have asked that the request
for autopsy be rejected.

01:48:31.318 --> 01:48:34.488
Since Mr. Liberace
has already been embalmed,

01:48:34.522 --> 01:48:37.724
it was necessary
to take tissue samples.

01:48:37.759 --> 01:48:39.626
Along with the medical
records of blood tests

01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:42.061
during his recent stay at the
Eisenhower Medical Center...

01:48:42.096 --> 01:48:46.032
it is the conclusion of the Riverside
County Health Department...

01:48:46.066 --> 01:48:48.734
that Mr. Liberace
died of complications

01:48:48.769 --> 01:48:50.703
due to the AIDS virus.

01:49:07.052 --> 01:49:08.920
<i>Thank you
all for coming.</i>

01:49:08.954 --> 01:49:10.955
<i>I think that what should be</i>
<i>remembered today</i>

01:49:10.989 --> 01:49:12.457
<i>is that Lee</i>
<i>was a great professional...</i>

01:49:12.491 --> 01:49:14.793
<i>a great showman,</i>
<i>he loved his fans.</i>

01:49:14.827 --> 01:49:17.328
<i>But we should also</i>
<i>look to the future.</i>

01:49:17.362 --> 01:49:19.095
<i>As a result</i>
<i>of the scholarship program</i>

01:49:19.130 --> 01:49:21.532
<i>which he's established</i>
<i>through his foundation...</i>

01:49:21.566 --> 01:49:23.700
many young people will have
a musical education

01:49:23.735 --> 01:49:25.836
which they otherwise
could not afford.

01:49:25.870 --> 01:49:27.704
Thank you.

01:49:30.041 --> 01:49:31.642
<i>My dear
people, let us begin</i>

01:49:31.676 --> 01:49:33.444
<i>as we begin</i>
<i>all things holy.</i>

01:49:33.478 --> 01:49:35.778
<i>In the name of the Father,</i>
<i>and of the Son,</i>

01:49:35.813 --> 01:49:37.480
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

01:49:37.514 --> 01:49:38.714
<i>Amen.</i>

01:49:38.749 --> 01:49:41.050
The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ...

01:49:41.084 --> 01:49:44.386
the love of God, and the
fellowship of the Holy Spirit

01:49:44.421 --> 01:49:45.788
be with you always.

01:49:45.823 --> 01:49:47.557
And with your spirit.

01:49:47.591 --> 01:49:49.525
<i>In the waters of baptism,</i>

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:51.860
<i>Liberace</i>
<i>died with Christ</i>

01:49:51.894 --> 01:49:54.128
<i>and rose within</i>
<i>to a new life.</i>

01:49:54.163 --> 01:49:55.764
<i>May he now share</i>
<i>with Him</i>

01:49:55.798 --> 01:49:59.233
in eternal glory.

01:49:59.268 --> 01:50:01.603
Let us pray.

01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:05.930
"To dream
the impossible dream

01:51:07.065 --> 01:51:11.235
To be better far
than you are

01:51:13.271 --> 01:51:18.442
<i>To try when your arms</i>
<i>are too weary</i>

01:51:18.476 --> 01:51:22.846
<i>To reach</i>
<i>that unreachable star</i>

01:51:24.181 --> 01:51:26.983
This is my quest

01:51:27.018 --> 01:51:30.286
To follow that star

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:33.423
No matter
how hopeless

01:51:33.457 --> 01:51:36.458
No matter how far

01:51:36.492 --> 01:51:38.961
<i>To be willing to give</i>

01:51:38.995 --> 01:51:41.530
<i>When there's</i>
<i>no more to give</i>

01:51:41.565 --> 01:51:43.999
To be willing to die

01:51:44.034 --> 01:51:47.703
So that honor and justice
may live

01:51:49.105 --> 01:51:51.338
And I know

01:51:51.373 --> 01:51:54.175
If I'll only be true

01:51:54.209 --> 01:51:57.879
To this glorious quest

01:51:57.913 --> 01:51:59.781
<i>My heart</i>

01:51:59.815 --> 01:52:02.817
<i>Shall lie peaceful</i>
<i>and calm</i>

01:52:02.851 --> 01:52:06.720
When I'm laid
to my rest."

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:29.775
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:33.512
<i>You have made me</i>
<i>the happiest piano player</i>

01:52:33.546 --> 01:52:35.414
<i>who has ever lived.</i>

01:52:35.448 --> 01:52:37.817
And no matter what,

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:41.786
I still believe
and always will...

01:52:41.821 --> 01:52:44.689
too much
of a good thing

01:52:44.724 --> 01:52:47.258
is <i>wonderful!</i>
