<i>Previously on Hostages...</i>

00:03.387 --> 00:05.044
Who gave the order to shoot?

00:05.175 --> 00:08.232
I did. I'm FBI Special Agent
Duncan Carlisle.

00:08.271 --> 00:09.945
(SCREAMS)

00:10.019 --> 00:12.239
He switched places
with the hostage.

00:12.315 --> 00:13.796
What if you'd been wrong?

00:13.831 --> 00:15.101
I wasn't.

00:15.178 --> 00:17.082
When is Mommy coming home?

00:17.154 --> 00:19.687
Mommy needs to rest, honey.
So she can get better.

00:19.812 --> 00:22.012
Dr. Sanders! How does it feel
to be responsible

00:22.014 --> 00:24.347
for the life of the President
of the United States?

00:24.349 --> 00:27.183
His life is no more important
than any of my patients'.

00:27.185 --> 00:30.320
Which is to say, it's the most
important thing in the world.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.789
- How was your day?
- Not as exciting as yours.

00:32.791 --> 00:35.758
- It was just a press conference.
- With the President.

00:35.760 --> 00:39.294
Mom, what are you doing home?
Did you get fired?

00:39.296 --> 00:41.463
I came home early to cook dinner.

00:41.465 --> 00:45.517
- Are you ready?
- Let's do it.

00:46.103 --> 00:47.503
(SCREAMS)

00:47.505 --> 00:49.404
Why are you doing this?

00:49.406 --> 00:52.240
You are going to kill the President
of the United States, Ellen.

00:52.242 --> 00:55.610
Otherwise,
we will kill your family.

00:55.612 --> 00:58.046
DUNCAN:
We know all your secrets.

00:58.048 --> 01:01.716
Sometimes you have to do
a bad thing for a good reason.

01:01.718 --> 01:03.317
ELLEN: Mr. President.
How are you feeling?

01:03.319 --> 01:05.218
I have full confidence in you.

01:05.221 --> 01:06.732
We've just been told
that the President

01:06.770 --> 01:08.779
will not be undergoing
surgery today.

01:08.891 --> 01:10.940
He was mistakenly
given a blood thinner

01:11.061 --> 01:13.449
only hours before
his scheduled surgery.

01:13.484 --> 01:15.462
REPORTER: Dr. Sanders.
How do you feel about this setback?

01:15.464 --> 01:19.379
- Are you upset?
- No. I don't give up that easily.

01:38.918 --> 01:42.387
Excuse me, Dr. Sanders?
We need you to come with us.

01:42.389 --> 01:43.354
Now.

02:00.005 --> 02:01.772
Are you okay?

02:01.774 --> 02:03.503
I can't believe this is happening.

02:03.574 --> 02:05.683
I'm positive I gave him
the right medication.

02:05.718 --> 02:07.644
I have no idea what...

02:07.646 --> 02:10.747
You are not to blame, Angela.
Everything's gonna be...

02:10.749 --> 02:13.149
Ma'am. Please step into
the conference room.

02:22.693 --> 02:25.894
Dr. Sanders.
Agent Hoffman.

02:27.097 --> 02:28.797
Won't you have a seat.

02:28.799 --> 02:30.432
Is everything all right
with the President?

02:30.434 --> 02:34.236
Oh, yes.
Thanks to you, Dr. Sanders.

02:34.238 --> 02:35.615
But as you might imagine,

02:35.689 --> 02:38.300
the Secret Service takes any
potential threat to the President's life

02:38.340 --> 02:42.581
very seriously, so I'm here to find out
exactly what happened.

02:43.178 --> 02:46.715
Good. I'm glad.
I feel terrible about this.

02:46.717 --> 02:48.750
About what?

02:48.752 --> 02:52.354
About someone accidentally
giving him the wrong medication.

02:52.356 --> 02:54.489
Why are you so sure
that it was an accident?

02:54.491 --> 02:59.960
I suppose I can't imagine
someone doing this on purpose.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.896
Other than you, how many medical
professionals had direct access

03:02.898 --> 03:04.565
to the President this morning?

03:04.567 --> 03:08.569
Two doctors and five nurses.

03:08.571 --> 03:11.905
And how did you know that the President
had been given a blood thinner?

03:11.907 --> 03:15.028
When he was in pre-op,
I noticed an unusual amount of blood

03:15.103 --> 03:16.935
forming around
the catheter in his arm.

03:16.970 --> 03:19.646
I was concerned that he might
not be clotting properly.

03:19.648 --> 03:22.292
So I ordered additional tests,
and when I saw the results,

03:22.327 --> 03:25.084
I realized he must have been
given a blood thinner.

03:25.086 --> 03:27.710
And I called off the surgery.

03:28.355 --> 03:30.398
Because it would have
been too risky?

03:30.657 --> 03:33.287
Because he would have died.

03:35.194 --> 03:38.696
Anything out of the ordinary happen
prior to that point in time?

03:41.668 --> 03:45.870
No. Not at all. I did everything
according to standard procedure.

03:45.872 --> 03:47.971
Is there anything else
we should know?

03:48.807 --> 03:51.509
(KNOCKING ON GLASS)

03:51.511 --> 03:54.645
Sir. You asked to see these
the second they came in.

03:54.647 --> 03:56.013
Excuse me a moment.

04:12.663 --> 04:16.565
How are Morgan and Jake getting along
with your new house guests?

04:22.038 --> 04:23.839
I'm sorry for the interruption.

04:28.712 --> 04:31.212
Is there anything else
you would like to share?

04:54.535 --> 04:58.772
Jake? Morgan?

05:06.848 --> 05:08.581
Where's my family?

05:10.718 --> 05:12.085
I'm impressed.

05:13.621 --> 05:14.821
Where are they?

05:16.591 --> 05:19.743
I knew you were resourceful, Ellen,
but I have to admit,

05:19.813 --> 05:21.452
I didn't see this coming.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.049
Brian!

05:23.097 --> 05:24.229
Jake!

05:24.231 --> 05:26.064
Save your breath, Ellen.

05:26.066 --> 05:27.800
What have you done with them?

05:27.802 --> 05:29.802
Did you really think you'd
get away with this?

05:29.804 --> 05:32.970
That there'd be no consequences?

05:33.273 --> 05:38.110
Please... I just...
I couldn't go through with it.

05:38.112 --> 05:41.780
But I will,
I can definitely do it.

05:41.782 --> 05:44.382
You expect me to believe that?

05:44.384 --> 05:46.518
Just tell me
you didn't hurt my family.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.820
Please.

05:48.822 --> 05:50.555
You should have thought
about them sooner.

05:50.557 --> 05:53.658
It's not too late.
I didn't say anything.

05:53.660 --> 05:54.958
Nobody knows you're here.

05:55.078 --> 05:57.320
I can still do what you want.
Nothing has changed!

05:57.355 --> 05:59.195
If only that were the case.

05:59.197 --> 06:02.866
Your clever little ruse has made
everything much more difficult.

06:02.868 --> 06:04.835
(SCREAMS)
Oh, no!

06:14.110 --> 06:16.145
(SCREAMING)

06:19.650 --> 06:21.383
One of them has to die.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.255
It's up to you.

06:29.325 --> 06:31.793
No, I... I can't...

06:34.029 --> 06:35.763
Then I'll kill them all.

06:35.765 --> 06:38.566
(SOBBING)
Please. Don't do this.

06:38.568 --> 06:40.568
Nice, thick walls.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.071
Nobody will hear a thing.

(ALL SOBBING)

06:50.178 --> 06:51.244
Is it him?

06:54.314 --> 06:56.382
- Her?
- Not my children!

06:58.151 --> 07:01.754
So the answer is Brian.
Good.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.458
But I want you to do it.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.494
Please...

07:08.496 --> 07:10.629
No, please... I...

07:10.631 --> 07:11.864
You can do it, Ellen.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.832
- No, I can't.
- You can.

07:13.834 --> 07:16.535
No, no, I can't... I...

07:17.321 --> 07:19.196
Yes, you can.

07:19.472 --> 07:22.574
You're tougher than you think.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.876
I'm gonna count to three.

07:26.211 --> 07:27.177
One...

07:28.514 --> 07:29.647
Two...

07:31.950 --> 07:32.917
Three.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.087
See?

07:37.089 --> 07:38.556
You are a killer.

Sometimes a mind game
is more effective.

Let me know when you want
me to bring them upstairs.

How come you didn't tell me
this was about the President?

Would it have made a difference?

Don't play hostage negotiator.
Not with me.

You know how this works, Archer.
The less everybody knows, the better.

I don't need protection. Just facts.

08:54.407 --> 08:57.373
Okay.
Ask me anything you want.

08:59.511 --> 09:01.477
Who else is involved?

09:01.479 --> 09:05.047
My contact is an official inside
the White House. That's all I know.

09:05.683 --> 09:07.883
- You trust him?
- No.

09:16.092 --> 09:17.659
You really didn't ask?

09:20.129 --> 09:21.963
Why not?

09:21.965 --> 09:24.098
None of my business.
Truth is, I don't really care.

09:24.100 --> 09:28.203
I want to know what's going on.
Is this guy a terrorist? A lunatic?

09:28.205 --> 09:30.572
No, not even close.

09:30.574 --> 09:34.408
I signed on for a simple blackmail gig,
24 hours, in and out.

09:34.410 --> 09:36.477
Not an assassination attempt.

09:36.479 --> 09:38.479
You saying you want to walk?

09:38.481 --> 09:39.947
Depends on the deal.

09:39.949 --> 09:42.350
He'll make it right.
He's a stand-up dude.

Yeah. All set.

will be killed.

Take off your shirt, Jake.

11:08.532 --> 11:10.898
- What?
- I won't ask again.

11:13.302 --> 11:14.669
What the hell are you doing?

- I'll do the cutting.
- No.

Excuse me?

12:12.425 --> 12:14.024
No one touches Dr. Sanders.

12:16.327 --> 12:18.395
I'm not worried about you, Ellen.

As long as I have your family,
you're not going anywhere.

all been cloned.

track every Google search.

12:30.509 --> 12:32.223
Even when your phones are off,

12:32.295 --> 12:35.781
we can still hear you,
we can still find you.

12:41.418 --> 12:42.619
We need to talk.

12:57.933 --> 13:01.435
Brian's had half a dozen texts.
What do you want to do?

13:09.610 --> 13:11.410
Take him for a drive.

13:15.350 --> 13:17.817
You. You're coming with me.

13:17.819 --> 13:19.286
What are you talking about?

13:19.288 --> 13:21.021
- Let's go.
- No!

13:22.090 --> 13:23.890
What the hell is going on?
Where are you taking him?

13:23.892 --> 13:27.460
Quiet. You've lost the right
to ask questions.

13:39.073 --> 13:41.259
- Your friend Sandrine.
- Yeah.

13:41.331 --> 13:44.999
When you brought her on
it was a one day operation, in and out.

13:45.011 --> 13:46.978
Now it's more complicated.

13:46.980 --> 13:48.746
She'll be fine.

13:48.748 --> 13:51.315
I met her in Afghanistan,
she's tough as hell.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.692
- Where are we going?
- Keep your mouth shut.

14:03.562 --> 14:04.728
Why are you doing this?

14:05.797 --> 14:08.264
My daddy didn't pay
enough attention to me.

14:10.702 --> 14:12.335
I can't believe this.

14:20.077 --> 14:23.356
Where the hell
did you take my husband?

14:34.457 --> 14:36.825
This whole thing would be over
right now if you had just...

14:36.827 --> 14:38.360
Just killed the President.

14:38.362 --> 14:42.898
We'd be gone. And you'd be free,
like nothing ever happened.

14:43.966 --> 14:48.002
- But you chose to break our agreement.
- I chose not to kill my patient!

14:50.739 --> 14:53.231
If the Secret Service
figures out you're responsible

14:53.267 --> 14:56.681
for giving Kincaid blood thinners,
this whole plan falls apart,

14:57.446 --> 15:01.948
which would be problematic.
For everyone.

15:06.954 --> 15:09.356
I'll make sure
they don't find out.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.861
I promise.

15:23.970 --> 15:26.138
Is my husband going to be okay?

15:28.708 --> 15:32.144
Please. Just tell me.

15:55.896 --> 15:58.031
Are you kidding me?

15:58.033 --> 16:00.100
You heard the man.
Back to normal.

16:00.102 --> 16:01.934
Think of this
as another Tuesday night.

16:01.936 --> 16:04.103
Take me home.
Right now. I can't...

16:06.573 --> 16:13.212
Look... I know what you think,
but I love my family.

16:13.214 --> 16:15.848
I'm not a priest.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.650
Look, I just want to be
with my wife and my children.

16:18.652 --> 16:21.319
Please take me home.

16:21.321 --> 16:23.355
It doesn't matter what you want.

16:23.357 --> 16:26.124
Here. This will help her forget
that you're two hours late.

16:26.126 --> 16:28.893
And that you're married
with two kids.

16:28.895 --> 16:31.795
Go in there and give your
girlfriend what she wants.

16:32.965 --> 16:37.293
Oh, and I'll be listening, so...
make sure you put on a good show.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.057
Hi.

17:01.059 --> 17:05.560
Hey. Sorry, it was just...
hard to get away...

17:05.563 --> 17:07.663
- Ellen's upset about the surgery.
- Yeah.

17:07.665 --> 17:09.531
- The President...
- I saw the news.

17:09.532 --> 17:11.398
Seems messy.

17:20.376 --> 17:21.809
You okay?

17:21.810 --> 17:24.810
Yeah... Yeah, I just...
I need a drink.

17:30.552 --> 17:32.820
So what are we celebrating?

17:34.423 --> 17:37.557
Uh... Us.

17:37.559 --> 17:38.725
Our time together.

17:38.727 --> 17:40.126
Our time together, all right.

17:40.128 --> 17:42.161
You really want to toast
to one night a week?

17:42.163 --> 17:44.831
Aw, I didn't mean it like that.

17:44.833 --> 17:47.971
How 'bout I amend the toast?

17:48.302 --> 17:49.669
Okay.

17:49.671 --> 17:50.837
To freedom.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.005
To freedom.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.545
So...

17:59.547 --> 18:03.381
Since when do you write
such long text messages?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.452
The ones you sent me tonight
didn't sound anything like you.

18:06.454 --> 18:10.020
Some of them were even longer
than two whole words.

18:10.022 --> 18:14.191
BRIAN: Oh, I was just, you know...
Just trying to have a little fun.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.927
SAMANTHA: How 'bout that last one,
was that just fun?

18:16.929 --> 18:18.062
What do you mean?

18:19.732 --> 18:21.498
Do you love me?

18:25.070 --> 18:26.336
Of course I do.

18:30.841 --> 18:32.709
Are you sure?

18:32.711 --> 18:34.378
Are you sure you're not just
trying to calm me down?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.021
'Cause I was annoyed...

18:36.058 --> 18:37.962
I was annoyed
when you didn't show up.

18:37.997 --> 18:40.116
You didn't even call, you know,
I don't like feeling...

18:40.118 --> 18:43.519
I'm sorry.
It's just family stuff...

18:43.521 --> 18:44.953
It's not easy.

18:44.955 --> 18:49.090
I know. It's not easy for me either,
dating a married man.

18:51.661 --> 18:53.800
Are you sure you're okay?

18:54.330 --> 18:57.632
Yeah. I'm fine.
I've just got a lot on my mind.

18:59.769 --> 19:02.537
Stuff at home is
very complicated.

19:02.539 --> 19:03.938
What do you mean?

19:08.543 --> 19:10.343
I can't talk about it.

19:11.346 --> 19:13.314
SAMANTHA:
So, it's about your wife?

19:13.316 --> 19:15.464
Yeah.

19:16.618 --> 19:19.123
Maybe you need
to just be honest with her

19:19.203 --> 19:21.213
and tell her
you don't love her anymore.

19:21.323 --> 19:22.555
But I do.

of rice, they're kind of salty.

off his dad's credit card.

20:06.277 --> 20:08.935
We sold his weed,
but never paid him

20:08.970 --> 20:11.611
because my father
found all the money.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.971
Maybe you could help me out?

20:14.973 --> 20:16.373
Sorry, Ace.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.274
Come on,
it'll take like 20 seconds.

20:18.276 --> 20:20.710
My dad probably hid the cash
in his bathroom. You could just...

20:20.712 --> 20:22.811
Not my problem.

20:31.988 --> 20:34.656
Why didn't you just kill
the President?

20:39.796 --> 20:42.816
I did what I thought was best.

20:44.733 --> 20:47.401
If I'd killed the President,
you would...

20:48.003 --> 20:50.104
never forgive me.

20:51.106 --> 20:55.209
And I wouldn't forgive myself,
because I would be a murderer.

20:57.412 --> 20:59.145
I thought about...

21:01.282 --> 21:03.582
what I would want you to do.

21:06.487 --> 21:08.646
Give in...

21:09.356 --> 21:11.457

you'll understand what I'm talking about.

I promise you.

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

Okay.

You know, we've been seeing
each other for two months,

23:39.598 --> 23:42.331
we've never spent
a weekend together.

23:43.534 --> 23:47.202
Okay, yeah. That sounds good.
Sounds nice.

24:57.671 --> 25:00.804
This is my son-in-law,
Special Agent Duncan Carlisle.

25:01.507 --> 25:04.342
I've heard good things about you.

25:06.578 --> 25:11.449
This matter we're discussing
is a necessary component

25:11.451 --> 25:16.185
of something much more important
than the life of any one man.

25:16.955 --> 25:20.924
Truth is, I like the President
very much.

25:22.593 --> 25:24.864
But sometimes
history calls upon us

25:24.937 --> 25:28.076
to do something bigger
than we ever expected.

25:29.199 --> 25:33.541
Sometimes we're asked to help
shape the future of the world.

25:33.576 --> 25:35.571
You have your reasons.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.975
I have mine.

25:51.020 --> 25:54.156
My partners have a very low
tolerance for failure.

25:54.158 --> 25:56.457
It's a delay. Not a failure.

25:56.459 --> 26:00.427
I'm not sure there's a distinction.
Not in this context.

26:01.797 --> 26:05.365
What Duncan is trying to say is,
we can still right the ship.

26:05.367 --> 26:07.935
Except for the delay,
nothing has changed.

26:07.937 --> 26:12.039
The key players remain in
position to execute the plan.

Dr. Sanders is responsible
for the blood thinner.

They won't.
I'll make sure of it.

the big deal with your phone?

they're playing mind games.

26:55.447 --> 27:00.050
Nowhere.

else to you?

that the Secret Service

They want me to take
a lie detector test.

27:40.090 --> 27:43.592
A polygraph is an inexact science.

27:43.594 --> 27:45.226
People beat them every day.

27:45.228 --> 27:47.562
Nothing more than a measurement
in variations in heart rate, breathing,

body temperature and perspiration.

You're a world-class surgeon, Ellen.

28:07.182 --> 28:08.916
If you can keep your
hand steady on a scalpel,

28:08.918 --> 28:11.218
when millimeters mark the
difference between life and death,

28:11.220 --> 28:13.653
you can certainly do this.

28:13.655 --> 28:17.089
DUNCAN: A polygraph requires
an accurate baseline reading.

28:17.091 --> 28:19.626

like when you're telling the truth,

when you're lying...

mental discipline, Ellen.

28:25.399 --> 28:28.234
Control your body's signals
from the beginning

28:28.236 --> 28:31.369

any variations under stress...

No.

Are you aware of any plots
to assassinate the President?

that they're focusing on.

30:26.846 --> 30:28.813

30:28.815 --> 30:32.283
You need to stop reassuring her
that she's innocent

30:32.285 --> 30:35.353
and start convincing her
that she's guilty.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.654
Angela needs to confess.

- But she didn't do anything wrong.
- Ellen...

She's one of my best friends.
There has to be another way.

30:46.398 --> 30:48.098
There isn't.

30:48.100 --> 30:49.867
Talk to her.

30:49.869 --> 30:51.534
Now.

30:58.642 --> 30:59.979
MAN:
Did you warn the suspect

31:00.051 --> 31:02.755
before you discharged your firearm
at the bank, Agent Carlisle?

31:02.781 --> 31:05.447
No. The opportunity
didn't present itself.

31:05.449 --> 31:07.717
What caused you to fire
on the suspect?

31:07.719 --> 31:10.285
He was attempting to escape
the scene with a hostage.

31:10.287 --> 31:14.189
But why resort to lethal force?
Why not continue to negotiate?

31:14.191 --> 31:16.692
He was under
way too much duress.

31:16.694 --> 31:19.394
In my estimation, he wasn't
thinking rationally at that moment.

31:19.396 --> 31:22.130
So, I chose to eliminate
the threat altogether.

31:22.132 --> 31:23.739
How could you possibly
have known

31:23.743 --> 31:26.029
the suspect was pretending
to be a hostage?

31:26.064 --> 31:27.719
I made a calculated bet,

31:27.754 --> 31:29.974
based on the data available to me
at the time.

31:30.039 --> 31:31.906
A calculated bet?

31:31.908 --> 31:36.845
As a hostage negotiator
my goal is to understand,

31:36.916 --> 31:39.131
and more importantly,
to empathize with the captor.

31:39.166 --> 31:42.381
To get inside his head,
to understand his options, his emotions.

31:43.383 --> 31:45.318
The only thing more stressful
than being held hostage

31:45.320 --> 31:48.521
is actually taking someone hostage.

31:48.523 --> 31:50.207
The danger, the fear,

31:50.242 --> 31:52.542
the constant risk analysis
is almost overwhelming.

31:52.627 --> 31:56.429
As such,
these situations are volatile.

31:56.431 --> 31:58.507
When the walls are closing in,

31:58.541 --> 32:02.447
a captor will do anything
to accomplish his mission.

32:02.837 --> 32:08.974
DUNCAN: Just like a hostage, he will do
whatever is necessary to survive.

32:08.976 --> 32:10.664
If the captor is smart enough,

32:10.740 --> 32:13.000
he can convince his hostage
to do whatever he wants.

32:13.079 --> 32:16.247
He can coerce that person into
becoming his emotional partner,

32:16.249 --> 32:20.417
into believing
they share the same goals.

32:20.419 --> 32:22.486
What I'm saying is, when you've
done this job as long as I have,

32:22.488 --> 32:25.857
you understand the psychology
of a hostage crisis.

32:25.859 --> 32:29.226
Let's just talk through
this together.

32:29.228 --> 32:31.862
Just examine the different choices.

32:31.864 --> 32:35.799
What choices? That jackass Hoffman
thinks I'm Bin Laden or something.

32:35.801 --> 32:37.367
It's ridiculous.

32:37.369 --> 32:40.036
They want me to take
another polygraph tomorrow.

32:40.772 --> 32:42.906
I... I need a lawyer.

32:44.809 --> 32:46.976
I can't keep
answering these questions.

32:46.978 --> 32:48.745
If you think that makes sense.

32:48.747 --> 32:51.547
I have no idea
what makes sense anymore.

32:51.549 --> 32:55.585
I keep telling them exactly what I did,
but they don't believe me.

32:55.587 --> 32:58.120
They just keep waiting
for me to change my story,

32:58.122 --> 33:00.422
or admit I made a mistake.

33:01.691 --> 33:03.258
Maybe you should.

33:03.260 --> 33:04.993
Should what?

33:04.995 --> 33:06.244
I'm just thinking out loud,

33:06.318 --> 33:08.539
but maybe the easiest way
to get through this thing

33:08.574 --> 33:14.235
is to simply admit
you made a mistake.

33:14.237 --> 33:15.836
But I didn't.

33:17.173 --> 33:18.820
I know you think you didn't,

33:18.854 --> 33:21.531
but it's your job
to administer the meds, right?

33:22.480 --> 33:24.234
If you didn't make a mistake...

33:24.580 --> 33:25.979
So now you don't believe me either?

33:25.981 --> 33:28.115
No, I'm not saying I don't
believe you, the truth is,

33:28.117 --> 33:31.786
it doesn't matter what I think.
It's what they think.

33:31.788 --> 33:35.655
All I'm saying is,
if you take responsibility for this,

33:35.657 --> 33:38.991
you'll probably just get a reprimand.

33:38.993 --> 33:41.194
Yeah, and my reputation
will be trashed.

33:41.196 --> 33:44.331
For the rest of my life, I'm gonna be
the nurse that almost killed the President.

33:46.334 --> 33:48.702
But if you don't,
they'll just keep digging.

33:48.704 --> 33:54.005
And if they find even the smallest
inconsistency in your testimony...

33:55.408 --> 33:58.176
they'll file charges.

33:58.178 --> 34:01.746
I mean, we're talking about
the President of the United States.

34:15.060 --> 34:17.395
The techs are sweeping
for evidence.

34:17.397 --> 34:21.665
Prints, DNA, trace...
Floor by floor, room by room.

34:21.667 --> 34:25.735
If Sanders took the heparin from one
of the pharmaceutical closets...

34:28.273 --> 34:30.940
We got a problem.
Any way to get in front of this?

34:30.942 --> 34:33.141
No. Security is too tight.

34:36.246 --> 34:37.880
(PHONE RINGING)

34:37.882 --> 34:39.581
- Hello?
- You took the heparin

34:39.616 --> 34:42.369
from the pharmaceutical room
on the 4th floor, correct?

34:43.620 --> 34:45.120
Yes.

34:45.121 --> 34:46.554
Did you touch anything?

34:46.556 --> 34:48.991
What do you mean, "Did I touch anything?"
I opened the door.

34:48.993 --> 34:50.893
- Were you wearing gloves?
- No.

34:50.895 --> 34:53.395
Is there any other plausible reason
for you to have been in that room

34:53.397 --> 34:55.397
on the day
of the President's surgery?

34:55.399 --> 34:56.898
No.

35:18.552 --> 35:20.387
(PHONE RINGING)

35:22.656 --> 35:24.657
What's our next move?

35:24.659 --> 35:26.927
We need to end
this investigation tonight.

35:26.929 --> 35:29.429
And how are we supposed
to do that?

35:29.431 --> 35:31.764
We give them somebody to blame.

35:50.762 --> 35:52.929
Excuse me, do you mind?

35:52.931 --> 35:55.197
I have to ask,
what in the world is

35:55.199 --> 35:58.668
an attractive lady such as yourself
doing here all alone?

35:58.670 --> 36:00.169
I'm waiting for a friend.

36:00.171 --> 36:02.004
How about I keep you
company while you wait?

36:02.006 --> 36:03.649
- No, thank you.
- Come on.

36:03.675 --> 36:05.268
Let me buy you another glass of...

36:05.276 --> 36:11.012
What's that, Pinot? No, too dark.
More like a... Petite Syrah?

36:11.014 --> 36:12.848
Hey, honey.
Sorry I'm late.

36:14.149 --> 36:16.818
Oh, I just got here myself.

36:16.820 --> 36:18.786
How you doing?
I'm Tom.

36:21.490 --> 36:24.692
- Thank you.
- No worries. Just trying to help out.

36:24.694 --> 36:26.994
Look, I don't want to intrude.
I'm sure you're waiting for someone...

36:26.996 --> 36:31.164
Oh, no. Truthfully I don't know
if she's even gonna show up, so...

36:32.601 --> 36:34.468
Can I buy you a drink?

36:38.038 --> 36:39.738
Yeah, why not?

36:40.140 --> 36:41.774
Great.

36:41.776 --> 36:42.775
Can I have a shot of whiskey?

36:45.212 --> 36:46.312
Headed out, sir?

36:46.314 --> 36:48.080
Following up on a lead.

37:09.635 --> 37:11.669
(PHONE DIALING)

37:11.671 --> 37:14.739
MACHINE: Hi, this is Angela,
leave me a message.

37:14.741 --> 37:17.107
Hey, it's me.
Just got to the bar.

37:17.109 --> 37:18.809
Sorry I'm so late.

37:18.811 --> 37:21.445
I guess just call me
if you get this.

37:30.922 --> 37:32.470
Excuse me. Hi.

37:32.505 --> 37:35.170
I'm supposed to meet a friend here.
Maybe you've seen her?

37:35.261 --> 37:39.095
A woman, dark hair, pretty,
about 35?

37:39.097 --> 37:40.823
Yeah. You just missed her.

37:40.898 --> 37:43.537
She and her boyfriend
left about a minute ago.

37:45.101 --> 37:46.835
Boyfriend?

37:46.837 --> 37:47.803
(SCOFFING)

37:49.806 --> 37:51.607
What did he look like?

37:55.478 --> 37:56.445
(RINGS DOORBELL)

37:57.646 --> 37:58.899
(KNOCKS)

37:58.938 --> 38:00.772
Angela?

38:20.534 --> 38:22.780
- HOFFMAN: Dr. Sanders.
- Oh.

38:23.771 --> 38:26.673
Hi. You scared me.

38:26.675 --> 38:28.609
Did you lose something?

38:28.611 --> 38:31.744
Oh, no... I was just looking
to see if Angela was around.

38:31.746 --> 38:34.780
We talked about getting
together tonight., but...

38:34.782 --> 38:36.849
- So she's not home?
- No. I don't think so.

38:36.851 --> 38:40.251
I rang the bell,
but she didn't answer.

38:41.221 --> 38:44.223
If you don't mind me asking,
what are you doing here?

38:44.225 --> 38:46.591
I mean, is everything okay
with Angela?

38:46.593 --> 38:49.694
I just had a few
routine questions.

38:49.696 --> 38:52.234
I'll catch up with her tomorrow.

38:54.100 --> 38:56.585
You have a nice night,
Dr. Sanders.

39:14.252 --> 39:16.687
Where have you been?

39:16.689 --> 39:20.440
Where's the other man?
The black guy?

39:20.758 --> 39:23.826
I don't know. Why?
What's going on?

39:23.828 --> 39:24.994
Turn on the news.

39:24.996 --> 39:26.829
What? What's happened?

39:26.831 --> 39:28.531
It's about Angela.

39:28.533 --> 39:32.469
<i>A vehicle registered to Angela Nix,
34, of Arlington, Virginia</i>

39:32.585 --> 39:35.575
<i>was found abandoned
by the Chesapeake Bay this evening.</i>

39:35.839 --> 39:37.811
<i>What appears
to be a suicide note</i>

39:37.851 --> 39:41.833
<i>was posted on Ms. Nix's Facebook page
only hours ago.</i>

39:41.868 --> 39:45.781
<i>In it, she expressed extreme remorse
over what she described as her</i>

39:45.783 --> 39:51.296
<i>"careless and near-fatal mistake,"
prior to President Kincaid's surgery.</i>

39:57.325 --> 39:59.359
You son of a bitch.
You killed her.

39:59.361 --> 40:02.096
No. You killed her.

40:02.098 --> 40:03.630
What?

40:03.632 --> 40:08.301
Actions have consequences, Ellen.
You failed to honor our agreement.

40:08.303 --> 40:13.272
You failed to convince your
friend to confess. You did this.

40:13.274 --> 40:15.274
Angela's death is on you.
