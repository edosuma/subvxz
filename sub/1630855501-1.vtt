WEBVTT

00:44.545 --> 00:50.050
The Warriors, the Knicks,
from Madison Square Garden in New York.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.011
Brian Anderson along with
the Hall of Famer Reggie Miller.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.472
An honor to be here tonight on this night

00:55.556 --> 00:58.308
when Stephen Curry
is on the doorstep of history.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.519
And an honor to be next to you
on this night…

01:00.602 --> 01:05.566
Knick hats, guys.
Knick hats. Hats, guys. Knick hats.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.569
History in the making right here.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.114
Steph Curry is going to break
the record for the most three-pointers.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.575
This is the night he's gonna do it.

01:24.751 --> 01:25.586
Okay.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.631
Tell me when y'all are ready.

01:34.553 --> 01:39.766
"Far below NBA standard in regard
to explosiveness and athleticism."

01:41.602 --> 01:47.107
"At 6'2", he's extremely small
for the NBA shooting guard position.

01:47.983 --> 01:50.986
Do not rely on him to run your team."

01:55.657 --> 01:58.702
"Can overshoot and rush into shots.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.915
Doesn't like when defenses
are too physical with him.

02:03.749 --> 02:09.713
Not a great finisher around the basket
due to his size and physical attributes.

02:10.756 --> 02:14.009
Needs to add some muscle
to his upper body,

02:14.718 --> 02:18.055
but appears as though
he'll always be skinny."

02:22.017 --> 02:26.396
That was the draft report
on Stephen Curry.

02:33.028 --> 02:35.030
Look at the fans as they rise up

02:35.113 --> 02:38.158
as Curry
is bringing the basketball up here.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.079
Everyone here is standing
to witness history.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.259
For the record!

02:56.677 --> 02:59.721
It's good! There it is!

02:59.805 --> 03:06.061
Stephen Curry!
The all-time three-point king of the NBA!

03:09.982 --> 03:11.984
Stephen Curry stands alone

03:12.067 --> 03:15.696
as the most dominant distance shooter
the game has ever seen.

03:15.779 --> 03:20.200
2,974 threes and counting.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.270
Pointer three-god for real, son.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.859
Silver fox.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.737
I had the green light tonight.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.780
-The license to shoot.
-You have the license.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.535
All right, get the fuck outta here, bro.

04:03.619 --> 04:06.955
Sorry for my language, Mama. I'm so sorry.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.333
…came over here, bro. Like…

04:09.416 --> 04:11.168
I had to come over here and say what's up.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.085
Love you, brother.

04:12.169 --> 04:17.173
Love you too, dawg. Yo.
I keep on telling you, dawg.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.259
Remember the time
you thought I was a little white kid?

04:20.636 --> 04:22.930
I think about that shit all the time, yo.

04:23.013 --> 04:26.183
I mean, who knew this shit ten years ago?
Now you that guy.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.393
-It's crazy.
-Nothing about it makes any sense.

04:28.477 --> 04:29.937
Embrace that shit.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.313
-All right?
-All right. Absolutely.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.981
-Good luck, brother.
-Appreciate it, man.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.069
-I love that dude, man.
-Dude.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.571
Most misunderstood dude
in the fricking league right there.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.500
I couldn't imagine
a better way to celebrate

04:51.583 --> 04:55.629
something that means so much to me,
to my family.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.675
I could not have ever imagined,
like, this would be a reality.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.972
And to know that everybody
in this room has had a part in my life,

05:05.055 --> 05:07.140
my journey, in some way, shape or form--

05:07.224 --> 05:09.434
Like, y'all know what this means to me.
This number right here?

05:09.518 --> 05:10.644
Yeah, baby!

05:13.772 --> 05:14.773
Yeah!

05:16.483 --> 05:19.570
It's a number, but it has
so much context, so much history,

05:19.653 --> 05:22.906
and we all get to own that together,
so thank y'all so much.

05:37.254 --> 05:40.382
I'm constantly trying to find the space

05:41.717 --> 05:45.596
just to be able to survey my life,
survey what's going on.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.436
To let my mind think about
"How did I get here?"

05:57.816 --> 05:59.860
My mind goes back to those places.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.780
And I think about everything.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.516
When I was nine years old,

06:30.599 --> 06:34.686
I played on the ten-and-under AAU team
the Charlotte Stars.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.439
I remember looking around like,

06:37.523 --> 06:39.858
"I'm not as tall as him,
not as strong as him."

06:41.527 --> 06:44.071
I was the undersized scrawny kid
that was just trying to figure out

06:44.154 --> 06:46.240
how to make it
at whatever level I was playing.

06:52.037 --> 06:55.582
That was when I first
really understood I'm different.

06:57.835 --> 07:02.005
And the temptation for me at that time
was to think about what I couldn't do.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.509
But I knew I could shoot.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.804
That was part
of what I brought to the team.

07:11.223 --> 07:14.268
[Sonya] Stephen! Good job, good job.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.688
Stephen!

07:21.024 --> 07:22.276
How old is he?

07:22.901 --> 07:26.154
[Sonya]
Fifteen. But he hasn't hit puberty yet.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.740
[Sonya] I asked the doctor,
I was starting to get worried.

07:31.827 --> 07:33.370
In my freshman year in high school,

07:33.912 --> 07:37.416
it was the first time I started
to think about, "What if I don't grow?"

07:39.501 --> 07:41.503
But also, like, "I know I can play."

07:46.842 --> 07:49.094
It never killed my love for the game.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.556
But it was a very difficult time,

07:53.724 --> 07:56.768
'cause I had to learn
how to embrace the challenge of it.

08:02.399 --> 08:06.737
His sophomore year, he said,
"I wanna play in college."

08:08.614 --> 08:10.866
He's, you know, probably, at that time,

08:11.491 --> 08:15.621
5'10", 5'11". Skinny.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.206
He's shooting from his waist.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.334
You know, younger co-- in high school,
you can get away with that,

08:20.417 --> 08:22.586
but I'm like, "Okay, if you wanna pl--
go to the next level,

08:23.712 --> 08:27.049
you gotta change your shot
from your waist. You gotta get up here."

08:32.011 --> 08:36.475
You gotta develop a totally different
set of muscles to make a change like that.

08:40.979 --> 08:44.900
Stephen was all in for the idea of it,

08:44.983 --> 08:50.155
until Dell took him out in the back
and he had to start shooting.

08:52.908 --> 08:56.954
It was a tough summer.
Me and Sonya, we both worked with him.

08:58.705 --> 09:03.085
For probably the first week,
he's just shooting right under the basket.

09:03.961 --> 09:08.465
Shot after shot, for hours every day.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.386
I was lost for a while.

09:13.470 --> 09:17.349
For three months, I literally
couldn't shoot outside of the paint.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.646
And he was just struggling.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.940
He was like, "I don't wanna do this.

09:25.023 --> 09:28.902
Why do I have to do this?
I can't keep going."

09:30.445 --> 09:32.990
And I was like,
"So, you have a choice, Son.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.575
You always have choices.

09:34.658 --> 09:38.954
If this is too frustrating for you
and you don't feel that it's valuable,

09:39.037 --> 09:42.916
stop now, go back to what you've--
how you've been shooting,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.585
and let's move on with this thing.

09:45.085 --> 09:49.923
But if you really are buying into
what your dad has prescribed for you,

09:51.258 --> 09:52.092
keep going."

10:09.985 --> 10:12.279
Nice. Release there.

10:14.239 --> 10:20.662
Three. Four. Four. Two.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.416
Here we go.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.967
Add a tennis ball to that.

10:41.517 --> 10:42.559
That's it.

10:53.737 --> 10:54.821
SLDL.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.417
Forty-five. Forty-five. Here we go.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.587
Watch, watch, watch. Coming here.

11:11.880 --> 11:12.881
I got it.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.096
Minus one.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.394
Even. Keep flowing. Just let it flow.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.896
-Keep up. Keep going.
-Lines.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.941
-Hustle.
-Come on.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.693
Beat, one, two.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.698
-Get in. Get in! Game.
-Come on! Hey!

11:38.448 --> 11:40.033
Perfection to finish.

11:40.117 --> 11:41.118
Yeah!

11:41.201 --> 11:43.620
Alternating range. Perfection to finish.

11:45.122 --> 11:48.375
Come on. Way to shoot it,
way to shoot it, way to shoot it.

11:48.458 --> 11:49.835
Good job, man. Good job, man.

12:10.731 --> 12:11.899
Hey, y'all. Welcome to Rightnowish.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.859
I'm your host, Pendarvis Harshaw.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.861
The Bay Bridge
still backed up to the overpasses,

12:15.944 --> 12:17.988
and there's also a report of a cra--

12:18.071 --> 12:20.407
95.7 The Game.

12:21.617 --> 12:23.577
In an absolute clunker in the Big Easy,

12:23.660 --> 12:28.123
the Warriors lose to the Pels 101-96.
They fall to 29-9.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.334
Should the Warriors be worried?

12:30.417 --> 12:33.629
Since their first 20 games,
they have been significantly worse.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.797
They're just not as dominant.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.467
I just keep thinking back
to the young version of the Warriors

12:38.550 --> 12:41.178
from a few years ago,
because they're not built the same way.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.721
It's just not the same team.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.350
And if Steph isn't gonna be MVP Steph,

12:46.433 --> 12:49.728
I don't think that the Warriors
are legitimate contenders.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.711
And starting at number 20 is a Junior.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.797
Steven Curry.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.176
That's Stephen Curry, you bum.

13:24.346 --> 13:25.639
What?

13:27.558 --> 13:28.892
Man, that was nuts.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.896
Man, that is crazy. That is…

13:38.443 --> 13:41.947
In my mind, I was thinking,
"That was interesting.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.492
He wasn't doing that last year.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.744
There's some improvement here.

13:49.246 --> 13:53.125
Look at his shot. Look at his pace.
Look at how he creates."

14:00.340 --> 14:04.928
Stephen Curry!

14:06.388 --> 14:11.185
There is just an art to what this kid
is doing out on the floor,

14:11.810 --> 14:16.064
and there is a drive
to be the absolute best.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.619
I started to play
pretty well in my junior year.

14:30.329 --> 14:32.206
And it created a little bit of a buzz.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.629
I wanted nothing more
than to go to Virginia Tech.

14:41.298 --> 14:43.383
My mom and my dad both went there.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.430
My dad's jersey's hanging in the rafters.

14:50.057 --> 14:53.852
There was a lot of conversation around
"were they gonna recruit me?"

14:57.898 --> 15:00.234
So, the Virginia Tech coach
came to the house.

15:02.277 --> 15:07.366
And he said, "You can definitely play.
No doubt. We see the skill.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.996
But we don't have a spot here.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.500
Well, he's too little.
He's gonna get pushed around.

15:16.583 --> 15:21.338
He's not big enough
to play major D1 basketball."

15:25.259 --> 15:29.805
I think that speaks to
how much I didn't pass the height test.

15:33.976 --> 15:38.146
But I really felt like
I could play with all those guys,

15:39.106 --> 15:41.942
if I can just
get an opportunity somewhere.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.449
Hey, let's go!

16:10.345 --> 16:14.725
Well, today it was clear
you played as if it was not robotic,

16:14.808 --> 16:17.519
as if I'm not
trying to get through practice.

16:17.603 --> 16:21.190
It was as-- It was a gift. It was a gift
to have this opportunity to play,

16:21.273 --> 16:22.649
and that's the way you played today.

16:22.733 --> 16:26.278
So obviously you played well,
obviously you played with confidence,

16:26.361 --> 16:27.529
and obviously we got better.

16:27.613 --> 16:32.534
So we accomplished a lot today,
all because of your attitude. Tremendous.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.036
Okay, now we gotta keep this going.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.163
-One, two, three, TCC.
-TCC!

17:04.233 --> 17:08.694
In 2005, several stories
in The Charlotte Observer popped up

17:08.779 --> 17:12.574
about someone named Stephen Curry
playing for Charlotte Christian.

17:13.951 --> 17:15.536
We started to pay attention.

17:16.036 --> 17:20.665
Not so much
as a high-profile focus of ours

17:20.749 --> 17:24.752
but someone
who we should just go and watch.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.424
Steph was mentioned as a player,

17:30.676 --> 17:31.844
but it wasn't like,

17:31.927 --> 17:34.972
"We have to go down to Charlotte Christian
and see Steph Curry play.

17:35.055 --> 17:38.141
You can't believe it when
you see him play." It was just a mention.

17:39.810 --> 17:43.814
I don't believe many schools
had walked in to watch Stephen play.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.357
Yeah!

17:46.400 --> 17:52.072
But we watched. We saw. We liked.

17:59.288 --> 18:03.125
It was interesting,
because he missed shots,

18:04.168 --> 18:07.754
he made turnovers, he made bad plays.

18:09.715 --> 18:10.883
But he never stopped playing.

18:12.301 --> 18:16.346
The next opportunity he had,
he would make a spectacular play.

18:18.724 --> 18:23.020
He showed a real emotional toughness,
which is so rare.

18:25.063 --> 18:28.025
So, we decided that
we were gonna recruit him.

18:34.823 --> 18:38.368
In the beginning,
I remember having very good conversations

18:38.452 --> 18:43.081
with Steph about Davidson, about his game.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.959
So we were feeling really, really good.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.799
And then all of a sudden,
I couldn't get Steph on the phone.

18:56.261 --> 18:58.013
And I had the sense that, "Oh, no.

18:59.014 --> 19:02.142
That means all these colleges
are now getting involved,

19:02.226 --> 19:04.228
and it's starting to blow up on us."

19:06.855 --> 19:08.273
So, I started to panic.

19:09.942 --> 19:11.985
I start reaching out
to his high school coach.

19:12.486 --> 19:15.239
I start reaching out to people around him.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.407
And still nothing.

19:21.995 --> 19:26.667
And I finally, about ten days later,
get Steph on the phone.

19:27.793 --> 19:31.171
And he goes, "Yeah, Coach,
my mother took my phone away from me.

19:32.130 --> 19:36.134
A friend of mine text me a curse word.

19:37.469 --> 19:40.764
I didn't send the text.
A friend sent a curse word to me,

19:40.848 --> 19:43.642
so my mother took my phone away
for two weeks."

19:47.020 --> 19:48.021
Let's go!

19:51.775 --> 19:55.821
At that point, when I realized
that other offers weren't coming,

19:56.697 --> 20:00.158
it became very clear that
I was on a different journey.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.494
Three-point basket is good.

20:02.578 --> 20:06.331
But Coach McKillop painted a vision
of what Davidson could mean for me,

20:06.415 --> 20:09.626
what him coaching me could mean for me
reaching my full potential.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.965
That year, we were losing seven seniors.

20:16.049 --> 20:20.304
And I think Stephen saw
an opportunity for himself

20:20.888 --> 20:23.182
and we told him about that opportunity.

20:23.891 --> 20:27.060
I think that excited him,
and that was even one more

20:28.896 --> 20:31.940
piece of the puzzle for him
as he made his decision.

20:37.738 --> 20:39.823
So, Matt Matheny and I
drove into Charlotte,

20:40.824 --> 20:45.913
sat down with everyone together
to answer every question

20:45.996 --> 20:48.373
that they might have about Davidson.

20:50.167 --> 20:54.588
We were two or three minutes
into the conversation,

20:54.671 --> 20:56.590
and Steph said, "Stop.

20:57.883 --> 20:58.967
Coach, just stop a second."

21:01.011 --> 21:03.013
And he says, "I've made my decision.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.516
I wanna be a Wildcat."

21:06.016 --> 21:08.477
And we were like,
"Oh, my gosh, that's fantastic!"

21:08.560 --> 21:10.604
We were dancing in the living room.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.023
There was a shot of adrenaline.

21:13.607 --> 21:14.608
There was…

21:15.859 --> 21:18.278
the sense that we just got a steal.

21:18.779 --> 21:20.948
No one knows how good this guy's gonna be.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.617
He is a perfect fit for what we do.

21:25.410 --> 21:29.540
So, before Coach left,
my mom thanked him for the opportunity.

21:30.374 --> 21:31.834
And the last thing she said was,

21:31.917 --> 21:33.961
"Don't worry, Coach,
we'll fatten him up for you."

21:34.795 --> 21:37.714
And Coach turned around
and looked at her and was like,

21:37.798 --> 21:41.009
"Don't worry about that.
We'll take him just the way he is."

21:41.510 --> 21:45.389
That gave me so much confidence
in terms of his appreciation for

21:46.682 --> 21:47.808
What I bring to the table.

21:48.392 --> 21:49.393
Like…

21:50.644 --> 21:53.480
I'm different,
but I have something to offer.

21:58.986 --> 21:59.987
I felt great.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.824
I really felt like
I had made the right decision.

22:05.993 --> 22:09.496
So, I went to watch a school football game
two or three days later,

22:10.664 --> 22:12.499
and I told, like, all my friends, like,

22:12.583 --> 22:15.169
"Yo, I know where
I'm going to school next year.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.337
I'm going to Davidson."

22:19.047 --> 22:21.675
And nobody knew where it was.
It was like--

22:22.509 --> 22:25.929
like, that hype in that moment
for me was so dope,

22:26.013 --> 22:28.932
and then nobody could really meet me
on that level emotionally,

22:29.016 --> 22:30.893
like, to celebrate it with me.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.070
Look at this one.

22:45.991 --> 22:51.622
I remember when Coach McKillop
came to recruit Stephen at the house,

22:52.122 --> 22:56.877
one of the things that he said
to Stephen was,

22:56.960 --> 22:58.879
"I can get you on stage.

22:58.962 --> 23:00.839
It's up to you what you'll do."

23:01.673 --> 23:03.342
What I liked so much is that

23:03.425 --> 23:05.928
it's not even necessarily about
proving other people wrong.

23:06.011 --> 23:07.804
-It's about proving…
-It's himself.

23:07.888 --> 23:09.806
-…himself right.
-Exactly. Yep.

23:09.890 --> 23:12.309
It was just, like, a different time.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.810
-Yeah.
-You know?

23:13.894 --> 23:16.396
He was so itty-bitty

23:16.897 --> 23:18.815
and everybody was picking on him,

23:18.899 --> 23:21.235
talking about he was too small to play.

23:21.318 --> 23:23.695
You remember when the man
was up in the stands,

23:23.779 --> 23:25.656
and he was calling them punks and stuff?

23:25.739 --> 23:28.158
I said, "Say one more thing,

23:28.242 --> 23:30.035
I'ma bust you in your mouth."

23:30.118 --> 23:31.995
I was gonna climb over that seat.

23:32.496 --> 23:34.665
-Not climb over the seat.
-I told him,

23:34.748 --> 23:36.250
"Don't talk about my grandson."

23:37.668 --> 23:39.920
-I remember.
-"Don't talk about my grandson."

23:45.425 --> 23:48.387
Remember I used to say
he looked like the Cabbage Patch doll?

23:53.267 --> 23:56.228
He was definitely an unplanned pregnancy.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.981
'Cause I wanted
to get through college first.

23:59.773 --> 24:01.984
And then I brought Stephen back with me,

24:02.067 --> 24:03.402
Seth back.

24:03.485 --> 24:08.740
Stephen was two and a half,
and he turned three when I graduated.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.492
How'd you have time for homework?

24:10.576 --> 24:12.160
-I know.
-You just did it.

24:12.244 --> 24:14.538
You just did it.
I really wanted to get my degree.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.374
-I get emotional thinking about it.
-Definitely.

24:17.457 --> 24:21.044
I was the first one in my family
to get my degree,

24:21.128 --> 24:25.090
and to me it was always like
something was unfinished.

24:29.761 --> 24:34.725
When Stephen decided to
declare for the NBA a year early,

24:35.475 --> 24:36.977
I wanted him to really understand

24:37.060 --> 24:39.271
how important it was
for him to get his degree.

24:40.230 --> 24:41.481
But then also,

24:41.565 --> 24:46.570
Stephen is the only player
who has not gotten their degree

24:46.653 --> 24:48.906
under the tutelage of Coach McKillop.

24:49.656 --> 24:53.410
So, it has been a thorn in his side
from me.

24:55.204 --> 24:57.956
And then he'll be like,
"I just won three championships."

24:58.040 --> 24:58.957
And I'm like,

24:59.041 --> 25:02.044
"You're right.
Now get the diploma championship."

25:15.390 --> 25:16.767
-Daddy?
-Yes?

25:16.850 --> 25:19.061
-Can I get a snack?
-A snack?

25:19.144 --> 25:20.687
-Yeah.
-Yes. You can get a snack.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.314
Like, a tomato or something.

25:35.911 --> 25:40.123
Oh, man, if y'all would've saw me
in summer school 2012.

25:40.207 --> 25:42.709
During a lockout,
my second year in the league,

25:44.044 --> 25:48.006
pulling up to Davidson's campus
in a G-Wagen at 8:00 a.m.

25:50.133 --> 25:54.137
And then the lockout ended abruptly,
and that's why it's an incomplete now.

25:55.138 --> 25:57.140
Couldn't get through the first semester.

26:01.395 --> 26:03.063
Hi. How are y'all doing?

26:03.146 --> 26:04.398
Hello. How are you?

26:05.440 --> 26:06.650
That's my doctor.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.610
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.448
No, not that kind of doctor.

26:14.116 --> 26:15.659
-Can you say hi?
-Hi.

26:15.742 --> 26:16.910
That's the crew.

26:16.994 --> 26:19.246
-Canon, Riley and Ryan.
-He's in third grade.

26:19.830 --> 26:21.498
-No, he's--
-They are adorable.

26:21.582 --> 26:24.751
-Canon is not in third-- What's Canon in?
-Preschool.

26:24.835 --> 26:25.961
Yes.

26:27.379 --> 26:30.382
I'm glad to catch up though.
I know we've got a lot to talk about.

26:30.465 --> 26:33.218
Yes. So, is this the year?

26:33.302 --> 26:34.386
I hope so.

26:34.469 --> 26:36.471
You're going to finish your degree?

26:37.097 --> 26:39.683
Is there a particular reason
you wanna do it now?

26:40.767 --> 26:45.856
For one, for my kids to see the process,
now that they're a little older

26:45.939 --> 26:50.194
and know-- you know,
how important this is.

26:50.277 --> 26:55.365
But also, I kinda got a gr-- a handle on
everything on the court and off the court

26:55.449 --> 26:59.661
more than I think I ever have and so,
trying to not let this drift on,

26:59.745 --> 27:00.829
you know, any longer.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.123
Well, that's great.

27:03.207 --> 27:08.086
So, next up, you'll be sending me
some ideas for writing a thesis.

27:08.754 --> 27:10.380
Absolutely. Thanks, Dr. Kaufman.

27:11.006 --> 27:12.549
-Okay. See ya.
-See you later.

27:15.093 --> 27:16.220
-Daddy.
-Yes.

27:16.303 --> 27:18.263
What are you gonna do at school?

27:20.432 --> 27:21.683
Oh, my God.

27:22.601 --> 27:23.810
You're not going to school?

27:23.894 --> 27:26.980
I am going to school now.
I'm going to school like you now.

27:28.148 --> 27:31.151
All righty, let the work begin.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.419
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the floor

27:49.503 --> 27:56.343
your 2006-2007 Davidson Wildcats!

27:59.638 --> 28:03.851
A 6'8" sophomore forward
from Benin City, Nigeria,

28:03.934 --> 28:07.646
number 41, Andrew Lovedale!

28:10.983 --> 28:14.361
A 6'2'' junior guard
from Barrington, Illinois,

28:14.444 --> 28:18.532
number two, Jason Richards!

28:21.410 --> 28:25.706
A 6-foot freshman guard
from Charlotte, North Carolina,

28:25.789 --> 28:29.376
number 30, Steph Curry!

28:42.639 --> 28:49.479
Introducing your 2006-2007
Davidson College basketball team!

28:56.653 --> 29:00.991
We had just lost a bunch of
seniors that were an NCAA tournament team.

29:02.367 --> 29:06.371
And, you know,
we had so many new faces on campus

29:06.455 --> 29:07.956
and there was a lot of doubt.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.834
It's gonna take a couple of years
for these guys to get going.

29:12.336 --> 29:15.881
Our team is young. They wanna be great.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.009
And our team needs you!

29:22.763 --> 29:25.390
They wanna be great! Thank you!

29:27.309 --> 29:30.229
We had no idea how good
we were gonna be

29:30.312 --> 29:33.607
or how bad we were gonna be.
We just didn't have a feel for it.

29:35.025 --> 29:39.363
So, it meant that Stephen Curry
would have to be a home run for us

29:39.446 --> 29:41.532
in order for us to be successful.

29:42.783 --> 29:43.784
A home run.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.705
We needed him,

29:48.789 --> 29:52.626
but a lot of questions around
what type of player

29:52.709 --> 29:55.003
Steph would be early on.

29:55.087 --> 29:57.214
'Cause he was ti-- He was small.

29:58.173 --> 30:01.218
You know, probably, like,
150 pounds soaking wet with his shoes on.

30:01.301 --> 30:05.097
My first impression was that,
this guy is so skinny,

30:05.180 --> 30:07.224
how is he going to hold up?

30:07.307 --> 30:09.893
I didn't think that he could, you know,
hang with us.

30:09.977 --> 30:13.146
And I thought I would probably crush him,
but…

30:18.110 --> 30:21.196
It was my first day
of practice at Davidson,

30:22.155 --> 30:26.243
and Coach McKillop put me with
Jason Richards, our captain point guard.

30:27.578 --> 30:31.540
And Jay Rich is killing me, like,
every time he touched the ball, he scores.

30:31.623 --> 30:32.791
And I can't get to stop him.

30:32.875 --> 30:35.919
I'm getting tired, I'm getting flustered,
I'm getting overwhelmed.

30:36.003 --> 30:38.130
Coach is old-school. Coach is New York.

30:39.923 --> 30:42.593
He finds out how far he can push you

30:43.135 --> 30:45.304
and kind of pushes you to that limit.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.514
He had prepared this whole scenario.

30:47.598 --> 30:50.100
He had a white handkerchief in his pocket.

30:50.184 --> 30:53.520
And I took out the handkerchief
that I always carry in my back pocket.

30:54.104 --> 30:56.356
And I waved it, and I said, "You…"

30:56.440 --> 30:57.900
"You wanna surrender, don't you?

30:57.983 --> 31:00.444
You wanna surrender, don't you?"
He kept saying over and over.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.404
"Here, take it. You wanna surrender,
go ahead, take it."

31:03.947 --> 31:05.949
The message was, you're on your own…

31:08.368 --> 31:09.786
and you gotta figure it out.

31:10.662 --> 31:11.663
Shot!

31:12.581 --> 31:13.498
I got that.

31:41.151 --> 31:46.406
Our first game of the season,
we had to travel to Ann Arbor, Michigan.

31:51.787 --> 31:55.499
It was a preseason tournament
hosted by the University of Michigan.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.419
We played Eastern Michigan…

32:02.005 --> 32:05.175
and it was Steph's first ever game
at Davidson.

32:51.221 --> 32:53.807
I turned the ball over
13 times in the game.

32:56.226 --> 32:59.730
And I was peptalking myself, like,
you know, "Figure this out, man."

32:59.813 --> 33:01.815
Like, "What the hell
are you doing out there?"

33:03.609 --> 33:06.403
But I was just overwhelmed by everything.

33:11.575 --> 33:13.785
I remember walking out of the gym.

33:14.411 --> 33:17.080
I remember being in the locker room
and thinking to myself,

33:17.164 --> 33:18.665
"This is gonna be a long year."

33:21.043 --> 33:24.588
The thought was,
"We just can't keep playing him."

33:26.423 --> 33:30.677
So, as a coaching staff, we had to decide,

33:32.596 --> 33:33.680
what are we gonna do?

33:54.701 --> 33:56.870
Step-back three on the way.

33:56.954 --> 33:58.830
But he can't find the three ball yet.

34:00.457 --> 34:02.209
Curry is one of six from beyond the arc.

34:04.628 --> 34:06.296
One of nine on threes.

34:07.631 --> 34:08.715
One of 12.

34:11.051 --> 34:13.469
It's just not there for Steph tonight.

34:14.721 --> 34:17.224
The shooting has just been horrific.

34:17.891 --> 34:19.560
The struggle is real right now.

34:22.603 --> 34:23.938
And the Warriors,

34:24.022 --> 34:27.900
despite scoring only 11 points
in the fourth quarter,

34:27.985 --> 34:30.779
they figure out a way to beat
the Utah Jazz,

34:30.862 --> 34:33.072
as we welcome everybody to
Warriors Postgame Live,

34:33.156 --> 34:34.491
presented by Toyota.

34:34.574 --> 34:37.703
I am Bonta Hill,
that is Festus Ezeli, NBA champ.

34:37.786 --> 34:39.746
Dorell Wright will join us
a little bit later.

34:39.830 --> 34:42.875
Look, Steph Curry was struggling tonight.
Five of 20 from the floor.

34:42.958 --> 34:45.043
He only finished with 13 points

34:45.127 --> 34:47.795
and he was one of 13
from the three-point line.

34:47.880 --> 34:51.925
The month of January continues to be
a rough one for Stephen Curry, Karen.

34:52.009 --> 34:54.261
What are you seeing
from opposing defenses,

34:54.344 --> 34:58.307
which is stifling Steph Curry and forcing
him into this poor shooting level?

35:08.150 --> 35:09.151
Action.

35:09.735 --> 35:15.240
So we're taking this to Italy because
Subway now has Italian-style capicola.

35:16.241 --> 35:19.369
Cut. That's pretty good.
Can we get some stuff on the bottom?

35:24.708 --> 35:29.046
I'm a little self-conscious 'cause I feel
like my eyes are half closed every take,

35:29.713 --> 35:31.632
but apparently they like it so far, so…

35:32.466 --> 35:33.675
It's kind of fun actually.

35:34.885 --> 35:37.638
Even when you're running
on two hours of sleep.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.811
There he is!

35:47.064 --> 35:48.065
Hold on.

35:49.441 --> 35:50.901
You are unbelievable.

35:50.984 --> 35:53.695
Hey, I got the stat sheet
when Kobe scored 62 in the Garden.

35:55.906 --> 35:56.990
So if you could just--

35:57.074 --> 35:58.867
-Where the-- Just sign.
-Absolutely.

35:58.951 --> 36:00.619
-To me, please.
-Absolutely.

36:00.702 --> 36:01.995
The Garden loves you, man.

36:02.079 --> 36:03.747
-New York loves you, man.
-Hey, I--

36:03.830 --> 36:06.041
That's the thing I got
a newfound appreciation for.

36:06.959 --> 36:09.253
-Love, man. Nothing but love.
-Hey. Thank you, man.

36:09.336 --> 36:10.838
And I hope you guys get another ring.

36:10.921 --> 36:12.506
-Absolutely. We're on the way.
-I'm pulling for you.

36:12.589 --> 36:13.590
I appreciate it.

36:22.683 --> 36:24.309
I would like some more food.

36:25.227 --> 36:26.645
I would like some more food.

36:27.646 --> 36:29.064
I would like some more food.

36:29.147 --> 36:30.440
You got it. It's right there.

36:30.524 --> 36:32.985
You're eating it.
You're putting it in your mouth.

36:33.652 --> 36:36.154
-I'm only giving you a little bit.
-I want a big one.

36:37.739 --> 36:38.740
I love you.

36:40.409 --> 36:41.410
Here.

36:43.537 --> 36:44.663
Let's see if it works.

36:45.163 --> 36:46.999
Are you writing down your workout?

36:47.082 --> 36:48.083
Yes, I am.

36:48.709 --> 36:50.460
How do you spell hakuna?

36:50.544 --> 36:52.629
H-A-K-U-N-A.

36:52.713 --> 36:55.549
-H-A-K-U…
-Show your muscles.

36:55.632 --> 36:56.633
Where your muscles at?

37:00.971 --> 37:02.639
Where your muscles at? Like this.

37:03.849 --> 37:05.350
-I can't do it.
-Why?

37:05.434 --> 37:06.643
My neck is hurting.

37:06.727 --> 37:08.729
Your neck is hurting? All right, bye.

37:08.812 --> 37:10.105
Go get some treatment.

38:04.159 --> 38:06.370
Everything that could go wrong went wrong

38:06.453 --> 38:08.330
in my first game against Eastern Michigan.

38:11.834 --> 38:16.046
So, it was just a shock
when Coach McKillop said,

38:16.129 --> 38:17.673
"You're gonna start the next game."

38:21.969 --> 38:23.720
I got a second chance,

38:24.638 --> 38:28.600
but there were extreme stakes
for my future as a basketball player.

38:30.143 --> 38:33.480
How would I respond to failure?
How would I respond in that moment?

38:35.315 --> 38:37.234
I felt such an urgency to that.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.577
Stephen Curry with a three-point basket.

39:33.081 --> 39:34.416
Stephen Curry.

39:42.382 --> 39:45.010
Basket by Stephen Curry.

40:02.069 --> 40:04.988
I had 32, I think,
in the second game of my career.

40:07.491 --> 40:11.161
We lost to Michigan,
but it was a moment of energy for me.

40:14.039 --> 40:17.251
Had he benched me and kind of
dimmed the light a little bit,

40:17.334 --> 40:19.127
who knows how it would've played out.

40:20.754 --> 40:25.884
But it was one of the more memorable
nights, just because, you know,

40:26.844 --> 40:31.014
reminding myself or convincing myself
that, you know,

40:31.098 --> 40:32.975
I was who I thought I was at that level.

40:45.070 --> 40:50.325
For a freshman to have
32 points in any game was very unique.

40:52.369 --> 40:54.705
So, when we came back to Davidson,

40:55.455 --> 40:58.041
people around town were talking.

40:59.209 --> 41:02.379
It was the first time
people started to take notice.

41:03.714 --> 41:06.717
But when I say people,
I mean really just people at Davidson.

41:09.803 --> 41:11.054
I'm recording.

41:16.518 --> 41:19.855
And now, your Davidson Wildcats.

41:23.567 --> 41:27.821
A 6-foot freshman guard
from Charlotte, North Carolina,

41:27.905 --> 41:30.824
number 30, Steph Curry!

41:35.954 --> 41:40.542
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!

41:45.964 --> 41:49.718
Three pointer for Steph Curry!

41:52.596 --> 41:54.765
I remember sitting there thinking,

41:54.848 --> 41:58.852
"That's unusual, that this tiny freshman

41:58.936 --> 42:04.316
has the level of green light
to take a three so quickly,

42:04.399 --> 42:07.611
miss a three and then take another one
and make it

42:07.694 --> 42:12.115
in, like, the first handful of seconds
of the game."

42:33.804 --> 42:34.805
Let's go!

42:34.888 --> 42:37.558
It was undeniably compelling.

42:38.767 --> 42:41.645
Felt like this was the start of a story
I needed to watch.

42:42.479 --> 42:48.485
And it also felt like at Davidson,
Stephen Curry was sort of our secret.

42:53.615 --> 42:55.158
Davidson Show

42:55.742 --> 42:58.245
There ain't no party
like a D-Show party

42:58.328 --> 43:00.205
Gonna take you high

43:00.289 --> 43:02.457
Shake your booty
From side to side

43:02.958 --> 43:04.084
The Davidson Show,

43:05.002 --> 43:08.172
this wildly popular
student-produced variety program

43:08.255 --> 43:09.339
people find funny.

43:10.340 --> 43:12.134
Hey, guys. What's up?

43:12.217 --> 43:13.177
Hey, guys.

43:13.260 --> 43:14.344
-What's up?
-Excuse me.

43:14.428 --> 43:16.763
Hey, welcome to
The Davidson Show takeover.

43:16.847 --> 43:19.433
-It is Monday night.
-We only got two words for you…

43:19.933 --> 43:20.767
Hang out.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.021
I love Commons
Hey

43:24.104 --> 43:26.690
Chicken biscuits
Hey

43:26.773 --> 43:29.651
Where's my grilled cheese?
Hey

43:29.735 --> 43:31.236
I love Commons

43:32.404 --> 43:35.199
The Outpost might be open later

43:35.282 --> 43:38.035
But Allison cannot flavor your tater

43:38.118 --> 43:40.704
Chester's du jour is all I'm here for

43:40.787 --> 43:42.122
Skipped class today

43:42.206 --> 43:44.291
And all I could say is
Um…

43:50.297 --> 43:53.967
Going to Davidson,
basketball was important,

43:54.051 --> 43:58.347
but it wasn't necessarily, like,
the thing that dominated every single day.

44:00.474 --> 44:01.975
I was going to class.

44:02.976 --> 44:04.436
I was doing homework.

44:05.646 --> 44:07.314
It was also a time to have fun

44:07.397 --> 44:09.525
and kind of exploring
and finding yourself.

44:14.404 --> 44:16.073
My freshman year,

44:16.156 --> 44:19.451
I had an opportunity to kind of
have a normal college experience.

44:21.328 --> 44:23.747
And it just kept me enjoying the moment.

44:30.087 --> 44:31.088
Go.

44:38.470 --> 44:40.848
On the court, our team was playing well.

44:42.266 --> 44:45.269
It surprised people
that we were winning games.

44:46.687 --> 44:49.398
And slowly the hype started to build
at Davidson.

44:56.530 --> 44:58.365
Everything was really exciting.

44:59.700 --> 45:01.785
But it was such an interesting time

45:03.036 --> 45:06.248
because very few people actually saw it.

45:07.833 --> 45:10.043
Social media was very new.

45:10.127 --> 45:12.337
And Davidson was in
the Southern Conference at the time,

45:12.421 --> 45:15.257
which is a real wrinkle in the story.

45:16.633 --> 45:18.260
It's a small conference.

45:19.261 --> 45:21.138
Very few games on TV.

45:21.930 --> 45:24.725
A couple maybe streamed on the Internet.

45:26.310 --> 45:28.854
So, if you wanted to see Stephen Curry,

45:30.063 --> 45:32.191
you had to go be there in person.

45:40.741 --> 45:41.825
What's up, everybody?

45:46.496 --> 45:48.332
Let's go! Let's do it. Let's do it.

45:49.708 --> 45:51.543
What's up?

45:55.797 --> 45:58.342
-Great to see you. Absolutely.
-Can he get a picture?

47:09.162 --> 47:13.125
So, I would love to, kind of,
just start with--

47:13.750 --> 47:17.504
I sent you that document last night
with just an update of where I'm at,

47:17.588 --> 47:21.717
looking at gender and inequality
in the realm of sports.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.553
And hopefully, there's enough
meat on the bone to kinda--

47:24.636 --> 47:28.182
you know, get some feedback from you on
if I'm in the right direction.

47:29.057 --> 47:30.267
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

47:30.350 --> 47:35.689
So, I think that you have
a lot of strong material.

47:36.607 --> 47:39.193
We're in a unusual situation here

47:39.276 --> 47:44.198
because you already are involved
in all of this and doing a lot.

47:44.281 --> 47:46.491
And so, it has great potential.

47:47.659 --> 47:53.040
So maybe it could be more of a living work
of impact, I guess,

47:53.123 --> 47:55.209
in terms of what it could be used for,

47:55.292 --> 47:56.919
after this whole process.

47:57.503 --> 47:58.587
Absolutely.

48:46.009 --> 48:48.011
In Steph's first year at Davidson,

48:49.680 --> 48:51.849
we had exceeded expectations.

48:54.226 --> 48:56.353
We made it to the NCAA tournament,

48:58.313 --> 49:00.357
and we had a chance
to grab the golden ring

49:01.441 --> 49:03.944
in Steph's first experience
in a tournament game.

49:11.285 --> 49:14.830
Thirteenth seed
Davidson against fourth seed Maryland.

49:14.913 --> 49:19.501
Davidson, this small little school
about 20 miles outside of Charlotte.

49:20.669 --> 49:23.922
Right over the 7-foot Bowers
of Maryland. What a shot.

49:24.006 --> 49:26.633
Are you kidding me? Oh, my goodness.

49:32.055 --> 49:33.682
Nice slap away by Osby.

49:35.142 --> 49:36.226
Great steal.

49:36.977 --> 49:38.604
Turnover for Davidson.

49:38.687 --> 49:41.315
Curry. Knocked away. Sloppy pass.

49:42.024 --> 49:43.525
They're falling apart.

49:44.568 --> 49:47.112
And the Maryland Terrapins will advance.

49:47.738 --> 49:49.698
They beat Davidson this afternoon,

49:49.781 --> 49:53.660
and it was a very competitive game
between thirteenth-seeded Davidson

49:53.744 --> 49:56.538
and the fourth seed Maryland Terrapins.

50:00.876 --> 50:04.755
When you are an underdog,
you have to take what is yours.

50:07.174 --> 50:08.842
And that became a theme for us.

50:11.261 --> 50:13.013
So, after that game,

50:14.014 --> 50:17.768
we immediately thrust ourselves
into a mindset of,

50:18.936 --> 50:21.897
we can't let this
slip through our hands again.

50:37.955 --> 50:44.253
The next season, most of our players,
Steph included, were actually returning.

50:45.629 --> 50:50.300
So we really felt like,
"Let's go for all the marbles."

50:52.052 --> 50:53.303
We decided

50:53.387 --> 50:56.390
that we were gonna try to play
one of the most difficult schedules

50:56.473 --> 50:57.683
in the country that year.

50:59.601 --> 51:02.145
We thought
if we could win these tough games,

51:02.813 --> 51:06.942
maybe we can get a better seed
in the NCAA tournament.

51:08.402 --> 51:11.238
And we could finally advance.

51:16.577 --> 51:20.539
Davidson trying to upset
the number one team in the country.

51:21.373 --> 51:24.585
Bob McKillop said
his team will run with North Carolina.

51:33.385 --> 51:34.469
Ellington.

51:36.847 --> 51:40.726
And Carolina
is going to survive Davidson College.

51:47.608 --> 51:49.860
You can feel the tension.

51:49.943 --> 51:52.863
Davidson, looks like they've got
an opportunity against the Blue Devils.

51:55.908 --> 51:57.951
And it was a close game.

52:02.789 --> 52:05.334
The Davidson Wildcats once again

52:05.417 --> 52:07.252
are facing a top-ten team coming in here.

52:07.961 --> 52:10.839
Westbrook right back, drives in, scores.

52:10.923 --> 52:13.717
Russell Westbrook making it look so easy.

52:17.471 --> 52:19.306
3.9 seconds…

52:20.641 --> 52:22.434
for Davidson to try to win it.

52:22.518 --> 52:24.019
It's a one-point game.

52:29.608 --> 52:31.485
It's gonna be Curry.

52:31.568 --> 52:33.695
Fells all over him, at the buzzer!

53:03.267 --> 53:07.145
We were going home
for Christmas with a 4-6 record.

53:10.190 --> 53:14.528
Everyone felt
like we had failed the mission.

53:16.989 --> 53:21.618
And it just looked
like our season could go south.

53:26.081 --> 53:27.499
It could cause you to doubt.

53:29.877 --> 53:31.545
It could shatter your confidence.

53:33.672 --> 53:36.466
How were we gonna be able to
take that next step?

53:38.635 --> 53:43.348
Because I still felt
that we were right there.

53:44.766 --> 53:48.770
One possession here, one difference there,

53:48.854 --> 53:51.356
and we could have won those four games.

53:51.440 --> 53:53.483
We were talented enough. We belonged.

53:53.984 --> 53:57.738
And I wanted them to be certain
that they understood that we belonged.

54:03.035 --> 54:05.537
Coach McKillop believed in us so much,

54:05.621 --> 54:07.372
and he thought
we had such a special group.

54:09.499 --> 54:11.919
But we kinda had, like,
that come-to-Jesus moment.

54:13.420 --> 54:15.839
He sat us all down for a film session.

54:16.673 --> 54:19.885
And he went around to every person
and, like, kinda called out,

54:20.427 --> 54:23.555
like, you know, what they needed
to do better or differently.

54:26.975 --> 54:27.976
Then he gets to Steph.

54:29.978 --> 54:30.896
And he just goes off

54:30.979 --> 54:33.774
and just tears into Steph
for a couple minutes.

54:34.650 --> 54:37.069
How Steph wasn't living up
to his responsibilities

54:37.152 --> 54:38.529
and how he wasn't getting it done.

54:41.990 --> 54:43.617
You can call it reprimanding.

54:43.700 --> 54:46.411
You can call it being direct.
You can call it motivating.

54:48.413 --> 54:51.416
At the end of the day, the message was,

54:51.500 --> 54:55.879
every piece has to work for us
to be competitive at the highest level.

54:58.048 --> 55:00.175
We know we're not the most athletic.

55:00.259 --> 55:03.095
We're not the most talented, the tallest,
the fastest.

55:05.472 --> 55:08.851
But if we can play like a team in unison,

55:10.269 --> 55:12.271
we can compete
with anybody in the country.

55:14.022 --> 55:16.149
And we gotta show that we can do it.

55:31.540 --> 55:32.833
Now to Curry.

55:34.168 --> 55:35.752
Curry's turned that one over.

55:36.628 --> 55:38.172
The Warriors turn it over again.

55:39.882 --> 55:41.383
It's a little alarming.

55:42.759 --> 55:44.928
Into Jokic.

55:45.012 --> 55:47.806
Out to Morris. A three to win!

55:49.349 --> 55:51.143
Denver wins it at the buzzer.

55:55.731 --> 56:00.027
James tries another three.
That's good! James from downtown.

56:00.110 --> 56:03.488
James sees an opening.
Drives inside and the flush.

56:03.572 --> 56:05.741
Monk, alley-oop to James!

56:09.995 --> 56:11.663
This will be just another

56:11.747 --> 56:14.374
in a series of disappointing losses
for the Warriors.

56:15.125 --> 56:18.128
Golden State has lost
eight out of ten games.

56:18.754 --> 56:20.923
Golden State is reeling.

56:21.006 --> 56:25.177
Golden State is cratering
right before your very eyes.

56:27.471 --> 56:31.850
What is the concern level
overall about this stretch?

56:35.354 --> 56:38.815
Giving in to, you know,
a losing mentality,

56:38.899 --> 56:42.444
like, we're not that team.

56:42.528 --> 56:44.112
I'm not gonna let us be that team.

56:45.739 --> 56:48.575
We cannot give in to this losing spirit

56:48.659 --> 56:51.745
of just finding different ways
to lose basketball games.

56:56.750 --> 56:59.211
Golden State has seven turnovers

57:00.254 --> 57:05.551
for a very seemingly disjointed
and disconcerted offense right now.

57:09.346 --> 57:10.848
Klay, good defense on Tatum.

57:10.931 --> 57:11.932
Knocked it away.

57:12.015 --> 57:15.310
It's Smart that got on the deck though.
Tatum forgot the ball.

57:15.394 --> 57:16.687
It's a three on one.

57:17.771 --> 57:20.732
And Steph was involved
in that initial collision,

57:21.233 --> 57:23.026
and he's trying to work out a few things.

57:24.778 --> 57:26.738
Steph Curry's actually hobbling.

57:27.447 --> 57:28.574
Wow. Yep.

57:31.243 --> 57:33.871
Steph is gonna get
that left ankle looked at.

57:41.044 --> 57:46.341
In that moment, it felt like,
"Did we just squander the season?"

57:55.184 --> 57:56.602
We felt like we were good.

57:58.562 --> 58:00.981
But the question was, in our minds,

58:02.107 --> 58:04.276
when are we gonna finally push through?

58:06.570 --> 58:11.700
And once we do it,
like, what is it gonna look like?

58:14.703 --> 58:15.704
At that point,

58:16.747 --> 58:19.625
we were playing
in a lower-level conference.

58:22.252 --> 58:23.879
And it meant that…

58:25.380 --> 58:30.302
the only chance that we had to qualify
for the NCAA tournament

58:31.595 --> 58:34.264
was winning
the Southern Conference Championship.

58:36.975 --> 58:38.435
We knew we were right there.

58:40.521 --> 58:44.983
But we also knew,
we have to be damn near perfect.

59:27.818 --> 59:31.697
Three pointer, Jason Richards.
Richards.

59:39.580 --> 59:43.250
Three pointer, Stephen Curry.

59:50.841 --> 59:51.842
Jason Richards.

59:52.342 --> 59:55.220
Good pass inside,
and the bucket and a foul.

01:00:26.502 --> 01:00:30.506
The Davidson Wildcats,
they've won 22 straight.

01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:34.593
They're heading to the NCAA tournament.

01:00:42.643 --> 01:00:47.272
Congratulations,
Bob McKillop, Stephen Curry.

01:00:47.356 --> 01:00:49.066
Davidson getting it done.

01:00:52.736 --> 01:00:54.446
We were just feeling this excitement

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:56.448
that we're going back to the dance,

01:00:57.407 --> 01:01:01.370
because we did what we were supposed to do
to get that opportunity.

01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:04.873
And Coach would always remind us,

01:01:04.957 --> 01:01:09.086
we just need to be
playing our best basketball in March.

01:01:17.344 --> 01:01:21.014
That team, after starting 4-6,

01:01:22.266 --> 01:01:24.643
just ran the table
in the Southern Conference.

01:01:26.436 --> 01:01:27.437
20-0.

01:01:28.981 --> 01:01:34.862
And we started to feel
that something special was happening.

01:01:39.491 --> 01:01:45.455
Davidson had not experienced
an NCAA tournament win since 1969.

01:01:47.165 --> 01:01:49.668
And in the many years since then,

01:01:50.919 --> 01:01:52.129
they have come close.

01:01:53.505 --> 01:01:54.923
But only close.

01:01:58.343 --> 01:02:02.222
So, I think we felt, watching this team,

01:02:02.723 --> 01:02:05.184
that this was the best chance

01:02:05.267 --> 01:02:09.271
that Davidson had had
in many of our lifetimes.

01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:15.736
Good evening, everyone. I'm Greg Gumbel.

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:17.362
Welcome to our New York studios

01:02:17.446 --> 01:02:20.407
and the NCAA
Basketball Championship Selection Show.

01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:24.036
Just a short while ago,
Division I Men's Basketball Committee

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:27.539
adjourned after finishing up
this year's tournament bracket.

01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:31.084
It is now time
to reveal the Midwest Region.

01:02:31.752 --> 01:02:36.757
The number seven seed in the Midwest,
the Bulldogs of Gonzaga, out of the WCC.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.967
And they'll take on the Davidson--

01:03:16.755 --> 01:03:19.174
When we got on the bus
and drove up to Raleigh,

01:03:20.133 --> 01:03:22.219
all my senses went through the roof.

01:03:24.847 --> 01:03:27.015
I can still picture the arena.

01:03:30.769 --> 01:03:32.479
Just the sights and the sounds.

01:03:34.857 --> 01:03:36.608
Go, go, go!

01:03:39.403 --> 01:03:40.779
I was nervous for sure.

01:03:43.198 --> 01:03:47.661
When you go to an NCAA practice,
there's more cameras.

01:03:49.538 --> 01:03:51.582
It's a different energy
and a different vibe.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:57.588
Even just seeing your same jerseys
with the NCAA patch on it,

01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:00.340
you know this is different.

01:04:02.176 --> 01:04:05.554
And for us,
we definitely felt the pressure,

01:04:06.138 --> 01:04:10.684
knowing that this was our best chance
to make some noise in the tournament.

01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:24.114
Davidson and Gonzaga.
The Wildcats and the Bulldogs.

01:04:27.826 --> 01:04:29.203
Davidson College,

01:04:29.286 --> 01:04:32.372
last year got knocked out
by Maryland in the first round.

01:04:33.457 --> 01:04:35.626
But this season,
riding a 22-game win streak,

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:36.710
longest in the nation.

01:04:40.214 --> 01:04:42.174
And for Bob McKillop,

01:04:42.257 --> 01:04:46.261
this is the fifth time he's directed
Davidson College to the NCAA tournament.

01:04:47.221 --> 01:04:48.972
Has yet to win one though, Jim.

01:04:55.687 --> 01:04:57.731
That's a three by Steven Gray.

01:04:58.315 --> 01:05:00.651
Curry gets caught.
Gray gets another open look.

01:05:00.734 --> 01:05:03.737
And he's now knocked down
two from behind the arc.

01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:07.324
Rejected by Lovedale.

01:05:08.116 --> 01:05:10.744
Gray now, for the third time hits a three.

01:05:15.082 --> 01:05:18.377
Gray. Still hasn't missed!
He's five for five.

01:05:19.503 --> 01:05:23.048
A 13-2 run by Gonzaga.

01:05:26.343 --> 01:05:28.762
Davidson's starting to panic a little bit,
Jim,

01:05:28.846 --> 01:05:30.931
and the fact that this game
is getting away from 'em.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:35.561
Dangerous time for Davidson right now.

01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:38.146
Gonzaga in total control.

01:05:57.541 --> 01:06:00.502
Curry with the steal.
Taking on Bouldin. And one.

01:06:10.262 --> 01:06:12.723
Curry, right back with a three.

01:06:14.641 --> 01:06:15.642
And there's room.

01:06:15.726 --> 01:06:16.977
Curry again!

01:06:17.978 --> 01:06:18.979
This kid's amazing.

01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:22.900
They're a Curry three away from tying it.

01:06:22.983 --> 01:06:25.694
Here it is. We're all tied in Raleigh.

01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:28.572
A 17-6 run.

01:06:30.115 --> 01:06:31.158
He is lighting it up.

01:06:38.081 --> 01:06:39.958
Ninety seconds remaining. Game tied.

01:06:42.753 --> 01:06:45.714
Two great teams,
a season coming down to the last minute.

01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:50.594
Richards on the baseline. Kicks it corner.

01:06:51.178 --> 01:06:52.179
Line drive.

01:06:52.262 --> 01:06:54.890
They had to beat the shot clock. Gosselin.

01:06:55.807 --> 01:06:58.685
And Lovedale keeps it for 'em. Curry!

01:06:58.769 --> 01:07:00.604
Are you kidding me?

01:07:00.687 --> 01:07:02.814
And he points over to his parents.

01:07:13.909 --> 01:07:15.410
In the arms of Curry.

01:07:15.494 --> 01:07:19.122
America had heard about him,
and now we know about him.

01:07:19.957 --> 01:07:23.377
A star on the NCAA tournament stage.

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:27.047
Stephen Curry leads Davidson
into the second round.

01:07:46.191 --> 01:07:50.612
I remember thinking,
"What the heck is going on?"

01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:56.410
Like, "You-- What are you doing?
How are you doing this?"

01:07:56.493 --> 01:08:00.330
And, like, almost like,
"Why are you doing this?

01:08:00.414 --> 01:08:01.331
And is this real?"

01:08:04.585 --> 01:08:05.878
That's probably to this day

01:08:05.961 --> 01:08:08.505
one of my favorite moments
as a basketball player.

01:08:11.717 --> 01:08:13.886
Playing in the tournament
that you grew up watching.

01:08:15.179 --> 01:08:18.348
But just knowing, like, you're doing
something historically special.

01:08:18.932 --> 01:08:21.643
Being this small Division I college

01:08:21.727 --> 01:08:24.479
that hadn't won a tournament game
in a long time

01:08:26.273 --> 01:08:27.441
and you're breaking through.

01:08:30.986 --> 01:08:35.157
It just felt like something
changed almost immediately for us.

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:41.412
The big thing that happens after that is,
"We can do this, right?"

01:08:43.582 --> 01:08:45.042
This was our moment,

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:50.339
because winning that game finally showed…

01:08:52.006 --> 01:08:53.008
we belonged.

01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:11.609
Winning our first NCAA
tournament game was just magical.

01:09:13.237 --> 01:09:14.863
It's like you're floating almost.

01:09:17.698 --> 01:09:20.368
But our first-round game against Gonzaga

01:09:20.452 --> 01:09:22.746
was one of the first games
of the tournament.

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:26.041
So we go back to the hotel,

01:09:27.042 --> 01:09:30.002
and we have roughly 48 hours
to prepare for the next game.

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:34.675
So our players take advantage
of that time,

01:09:34.758 --> 01:09:36.926
and they do their homework.

01:09:42.850 --> 01:09:44.350
It's still hilarious to me

01:09:44.434 --> 01:09:47.563
that in the biggest basketball moment
of the year,

01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:50.816
we're all in the hallway
with other students, doing papers.

01:09:53.527 --> 01:09:55.988
But that's just the Davidson experience.

01:09:57.364 --> 01:10:00.534
And it's the best thing in the world.

01:10:01.034 --> 01:10:02.536
It's still funny to me.

01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:26.560
-Here we go.
-March Madness!

01:10:27.853 --> 01:10:31.899
In Greenville, South Carolina,
Davidson, the Wildcats,

01:10:31.982 --> 01:10:34.526
taking on Michigan State, the Spartans.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:37.404
The winner to face Duke
on Sunday on this floor.

01:10:37.487 --> 01:10:38.906
Let's go!

01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:43.118
Game four. Hello, friends.
Jim Nantz, Grant Hill, Bill Raftery.

01:10:43.202 --> 01:10:45.037
Ready for one more, guys? Let's do it.

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.622
-What do you say?
-Jim Nantz is good luck.

01:10:46.705 --> 01:10:48.165
Hello, friends.

01:10:48.248 --> 01:10:50.709
This is big.
Bill Raftery's doing this game?

01:10:50.792 --> 01:10:52.503
With a kiss.

01:10:52.586 --> 01:10:56.340
-Bob McKillop. Tom Izzo…
-Takes it to the tin for two.

01:10:56.423 --> 01:10:58.008
-Tom, older…
-Can-Can.

01:10:58.091 --> 01:10:59.134
Say, "Go Cats."

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.178
Get buckets!

01:11:01.261 --> 01:11:03.972
-Get buckets. That's right. Yes.
-Get buckets?

01:11:04.056 --> 01:11:06.183
…I think manhandled, in a sense. Loyer.

01:11:06.266 --> 01:11:08.435
There he is, using power and strength.

01:11:08.519 --> 01:11:10.145
He's the one guy that can get a basket.

01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:11.230
Come on, Foster.

01:11:12.439 --> 01:11:14.816
Feel you, bruh.
I used to get picked on all the time.

01:11:18.403 --> 01:11:19.821
Another pass sails.

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:23.408
Always in the right spot, this team.

01:11:23.492 --> 01:11:25.911
It's a Sparty party, baby!

01:11:27.621 --> 01:11:32.835
Dad, I want candy. Daddy.

01:11:32.918 --> 01:11:34.670
We just did a nasty turnover.

01:11:34.753 --> 01:11:38.799
I like this though.
We're right where we wanna be, baby.

01:11:38.882 --> 01:11:40.217
'Cause y'all too comfortable right now.

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:43.136
Y'all think y'all can just turn it on
and just blow us out by 20.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.972
And one!

01:11:45.806 --> 01:11:47.015
His confidence is soaring.

01:11:47.099 --> 01:11:49.309
I might have to send a halftime text.

01:11:49.393 --> 01:11:50.686
Dada, I don't want this.

01:11:50.769 --> 01:11:52.312
-I'ma holler at you. We're gonna talk.
-Bye.

01:11:52.396 --> 01:11:55.649
-Saw it right there.
-Uh-oh. Silver fox.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.611
Bob McKillop. We saw that '08 team.

01:12:00.529 --> 01:12:02.698
My gosh, that was something special.

01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:04.449
Had a pretty good player on that team too.

01:12:04.533 --> 01:12:05.868
What's he doing now?

01:12:05.951 --> 01:12:07.619
I haven't heard from him in years.

01:12:09.288 --> 01:12:10.747
Steph, we know you're watching.

01:12:13.166 --> 01:12:14.877
Their great defense right here.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.211
I've never asked you this.

01:12:16.712 --> 01:12:18.922
What was your thought
when Lovedale got that rebound?

01:12:19.423 --> 01:12:20.340
Against Gonzaga.

01:12:20.424 --> 01:12:22.634
Dude, it was
freaking like a song started playing.

01:12:22.718 --> 01:12:26.889
And it was like a-- it was like a melody,
'cause I-- My first thought was like,

01:12:26.972 --> 01:12:30.225
"Pass me the ball."
And then I saw he had no hesitation.

01:12:30.309 --> 01:12:35.063
Probably the biggest play

01:12:35.147 --> 01:12:37.149
-in Davidson history…
-1,000%.

01:12:37.232 --> 01:12:39.735
-…the offensive rebound.
-1,000%.

01:12:40.819 --> 01:12:44.615
Defense! Defense! Defense! Defense!

01:12:47.743 --> 01:12:50.787
If beating Gonzaga
was getting over a hump,

01:12:50.871 --> 01:12:54.333
the Wildcats' next opponent
will be climbing a mountain.

01:12:55.042 --> 01:13:00.047
Up next, second-seeded Georgetown
and their 7-foot star center, Roy Hibbert.

01:13:08.263 --> 01:13:11.308
I remember, we were tailgating
out in the parking lot.

01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:13.435
We're having a good time.

01:13:16.605 --> 01:13:18.982
And then I see Doc Rivers.

01:13:20.817 --> 01:13:23.529
He's come to watch his son play
for Georgetown.

01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:26.532
And he's like, "Hey, Dell."
I'm like, "Hey, Doc."

01:13:27.199 --> 01:13:29.368
He goes, "Y'all guys have fun.

01:13:29.451 --> 01:13:31.203
Enjoy yourself. It's, you know--

01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:33.163
This is the last time
you're gonna be doing this."

01:13:33.664 --> 01:13:37.209
I went, "Look, there goes Doc.
He thinks we don't have a chance."

01:13:37.292 --> 01:13:39.044
I'm thinking, "The-- Is he right?"

01:13:39.127 --> 01:13:41.755
I hadn't seen a lot of Georgetown,
but it's Georgetown.

01:13:41.839 --> 01:13:43.507
-One, two, three.
-Wildcats.

01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:47.386
-Let's have some fun, boys!
-When we get to play Georgetown,

01:13:48.428 --> 01:13:50.180
the ten versus the two seed,

01:13:51.849 --> 01:13:56.520
I think most people
were predicting that we had no chance.

01:13:59.481 --> 01:14:02.234
We knew we had to play
pretty much a perfect game to beat 'em.

01:14:04.403 --> 01:14:06.780
But we felt we could do that.

01:14:19.710 --> 01:14:20.836
Beautiful pass.

01:14:20.919 --> 01:14:23.755
Curry gives it up,
but that is swatted away.

01:14:36.435 --> 01:14:37.811
That one was halfway down.

01:14:45.027 --> 01:14:47.571
Ewing drives for the dunk. And one.

01:14:52.034 --> 01:14:54.661
Georgetown shooting over 70%,
and they hit again.

01:14:55.954 --> 01:14:58.248
And this lead now has ballooned to 17.

01:14:59.791 --> 01:15:00.876
My goodness.

01:15:03.462 --> 01:15:06.715
They're holding Davidson to 27% shooting.

01:15:07.966 --> 01:15:10.594
Boy, they shut you down better
than anybody in the country.

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.938
I just remember the moment.
We're down 17 points.

01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:24.858
We come to the bench.

01:15:26.109 --> 01:15:27.402
And Coach is in the huddle…

01:15:29.279 --> 01:15:30.364
and he's smiling.

01:15:33.408 --> 01:15:35.744
And it was like, "What's going on here?

01:15:37.287 --> 01:15:38.872
Is there something that we're missing?"

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:42.251
It was surprising.

01:15:44.169 --> 01:15:46.380
Coach was saying, "We're fine.

01:15:47.422 --> 01:15:50.759
We did this against Gonzaga.

01:15:52.177 --> 01:15:53.387
We've been here before."

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.103
Right now,
you can see why Georgetown worked

01:16:01.186 --> 01:16:03.981
their way to a regular season
number one in the Big East.

01:16:05.524 --> 01:16:07.401
Tough pass. Richards with the steal.

01:16:08.277 --> 01:16:10.487
That's Curry leading the break,
and now the lob.

01:16:10.571 --> 01:16:12.906
And the lay-in by Paulhus Gosselin.

01:16:17.578 --> 01:16:21.039
Tipped out to Richards.
Hoyas though got three men back.

01:16:23.917 --> 01:16:26.253
And one. It could be a four-point play.

01:16:31.008 --> 01:16:33.135
And how about this? They're pressing.

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:41.602
Curry, tough shot.

01:16:42.186 --> 01:16:45.355
Ball on the floor
and into the arms of Sander for the layup.

01:16:45.898 --> 01:16:47.107
And it's down to nine.

01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:51.904
Curry whips it inside.
Lovedale easily for the layup.

01:16:58.827 --> 01:16:59.995
Beautiful pass!

01:17:00.078 --> 01:17:02.289
Lovedale makes it a two-point game.

01:17:09.171 --> 01:17:10.380
What a pass.

01:17:15.302 --> 01:17:17.554
What a nifty move. With a dipsy--

01:17:24.937 --> 01:17:28.148
Here's Curry. Oh, my goodness.
Another three.

01:17:30.984 --> 01:17:34.321
The two in the Midwest
is in serious jeopardy

01:17:34.821 --> 01:17:38.033
after losing a 17-point second-half lead.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.291
And you do see the North Carolina fans now

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:47.835
getting into the action.

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:52.172
And they're rooting
for this upstart mid-major Davidson,

01:17:52.256 --> 01:17:53.799
out of the Charlotte area.

01:17:57.094 --> 01:17:58.554
Well, you talk about a giant-killer.

01:17:59.847 --> 01:18:01.765
-This is big right here.
-Yep.

01:18:01.849 --> 01:18:03.600
What Davidson could pull off right here.

01:18:06.478 --> 01:18:09.231
It's a four-point game, with nine seconds.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:11.441
Wallace.

01:18:12.985 --> 01:18:13.986
Shot up, Sapp.

01:18:14.528 --> 01:18:16.780
-No. They--
-Oh, Lovedale.

01:18:16.864 --> 01:18:19.449
And talk about David and Goliath,

01:18:19.533 --> 01:18:24.746
I submit to you,
Davidson College to the Sweet 16.

01:18:39.052 --> 01:18:40.262
Hey! Let's go, everybody!

01:18:41.471 --> 01:18:45.100
It's all y'all! All y'all right here!

01:19:14.755 --> 01:19:18.884
In the moment, you don't know
the magnitude of what's going on.

01:19:21.512 --> 01:19:24.181
But the next day, my roommate and I,

01:19:24.264 --> 01:19:27.893
Thomas Sander, was going
to the local gas station to fill up gas.

01:19:30.312 --> 01:19:33.357
I'm there filling up,
and somebody comes out of the store.

01:19:34.525 --> 01:19:36.985
And she goes, "Hey.
You're the guy in the newspaper."

01:19:37.945 --> 01:19:42.533
So, I look over, and on the USA Today,
it's Steph and I

01:19:42.616 --> 01:19:44.493
in probably one of the most awkward hugs

01:19:44.576 --> 01:19:46.453
you'll ever get from a celebration.

01:19:47.037 --> 01:19:49.873
That's when it started to really feel
a little different.

01:19:49.957 --> 01:19:52.501
Like, this is a little bit bigger
than we ever expected.

01:20:01.969 --> 01:20:03.136
This isn't supposed to happen.

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:05.264
Davidson's not supposed to
beat Georgetown.

01:20:05.347 --> 01:20:08.725
Davidson's not supposed to beat Georgetown
down 17 in the second half.

01:20:10.102 --> 01:20:14.857
Stephen Curry looks like a little kid,
but he has got the game of a grown man.

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.983
Get familiar!

01:20:18.277 --> 01:20:20.529
Stephen Curry.
I mean this is unbelievable.

01:20:20.612 --> 01:20:22.781
You're down 17 in the NCAA tournament.

01:20:22.865 --> 01:20:25.534
The kid played
with ice water in his veins.

01:20:26.326 --> 01:20:28.161
Really, one of the great stories

01:20:28.245 --> 01:20:30.747
in college basketball
is Curry at Davidson.

01:20:30.831 --> 01:20:34.084
It's a wonderful story. Wasn't recruited
by others and ended up there--

01:20:34.168 --> 01:20:35.252
We had him in our camp.

01:20:35.335 --> 01:20:36.628
-And missed him?
-Missed him?

01:20:36.712 --> 01:20:38.672
He was about 5'6".

01:20:39.131 --> 01:20:42.968
They are now the darlings of America.
Even though they're not the lowest seed,

01:20:43.051 --> 01:20:45.012
they are obviously
the Cinderella in this tournament.

01:20:46.096 --> 01:20:51.310
And good morning to you
from the campus of Davidson College.

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:57.649
You know what, Maggie? The last time
this college was in the Sweet 16 was 1969.

01:20:57.733 --> 01:21:00.694
And we've got the entire campus out here.

01:21:01.570 --> 01:21:05.699
Folks, much more from Davidson College
coming up in just a little while.

01:21:06.867 --> 01:21:09.494
Harry, Maggie, we'll send it back to you
in New York.

01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:28.847
Coming up on today's
Locked On NBA, we rank the playoff teams

01:21:28.931 --> 01:21:32.851
in order of which ones
have the best chance of making the finals.

01:21:32.935 --> 01:21:34.978
This is the easiest pick
in the world for me.

01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:36.271
It's gotta be the Phoenix Suns.

01:21:36.355 --> 01:21:38.315
Phoenix is the best team in the NBA.

01:21:38.398 --> 01:21:40.108
I think the Suns
are gonna win it all this year.

01:21:40.192 --> 01:21:41.193
1,000%.

01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:43.487
The Golden State Warriors are much more

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:45.322
about the sum of their parts,

01:21:45.405 --> 01:21:49.201
and they haven't been on the court
at all together, their three star players.

01:21:49.284 --> 01:21:53.038
It's really as simple as,
is Steph healthy?

01:21:53.121 --> 01:21:56.917
It's gonna be a close call
about his availability on Saturday.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.753
Honestly, if he's not right,
I don't think they get to the West finals.

01:21:59.837 --> 01:22:02.130
I feel like I know
to a degree who Golden State is,

01:22:02.214 --> 01:22:04.842
but Klay not playing for two years,
trying to find his way,

01:22:04.925 --> 01:22:08.053
Steph coming off the injury
this late in the season.

01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:09.388
There's some questions around

01:22:09.471 --> 01:22:11.890
whether they will be that team
hitting on all cylinders.

01:22:42.129 --> 01:22:44.131
I can't wait to see you in a little bit.

01:22:44.214 --> 01:22:46.925
Can't wait to see you too. I love you.

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:50.512
I love you more. I'm so excited.

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:52.639
-Me too.
-Have a great--

01:22:53.599 --> 01:22:56.018
Have a great game. I'll be watching,
rooting and praying for you.

01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:57.102
Thank you, baby.

01:22:58.937 --> 01:22:59.938
Get buckets.

01:23:00.022 --> 01:23:01.023
And you know it.

01:23:03.734 --> 01:23:04.818
-Hey.
-What's up?

01:23:05.652 --> 01:23:06.653
Have fun out there.

01:23:06.737 --> 01:23:07.738
I will.

01:23:26.256 --> 01:23:30.427
As we left for Detroit
to go to the Sweet 16,

01:23:31.845 --> 01:23:34.223
the streets of Davidson
were lined with people

01:23:34.932 --> 01:23:38.018
as if it was a Fourth of July parade.

01:23:39.728 --> 01:23:40.729
And…

01:23:43.065 --> 01:23:45.359
it was as if
you never wanted the ride to end.

01:23:58.413 --> 01:24:00.749
The excitement was unbelievable.

01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:06.713
And we started talking about,
where are we playing next, which arena.

01:24:08.632 --> 01:24:10.801
And someone said,
"We're going to Ford Field."

01:24:12.511 --> 01:24:14.263
We're playing at a football stadium.

01:24:23.772 --> 01:24:25.816
Playing in a football stadium,

01:24:25.899 --> 01:24:28.068
it was an environment
we had never been in before.

01:24:30.112 --> 01:24:32.739
But we were so comfortable, I think,
in that moment,

01:24:34.199 --> 01:24:36.243
'cause we were playing
with unlimited confidence

01:24:36.326 --> 01:24:38.370
that we were supposed to be there.

01:24:46.295 --> 01:24:50.507
So, we were driving back
from shootaround before the game,

01:24:51.884 --> 01:24:53.093
and I got a phone call.

01:24:53.969 --> 01:24:55.596
It was some Nike executives,

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:00.559
and they said,
"We just got a call from LeBron.

01:25:01.435 --> 01:25:04.897
He wants to come to your Sweet 16 game
against Wisconsin tonight.

01:25:05.814 --> 01:25:07.149
Can he get eight tickets?"

01:25:07.774 --> 01:25:09.985
And my first thought was,
"You gotta be kidding me."

01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:18.994
Hearing that Bron
was gonna be at the game,

01:25:19.786 --> 01:25:21.663
we didn't know what to do with ourselves.

01:25:23.165 --> 01:25:27.252
But also, we didn't know
that the Davidson Board of Trustees

01:25:27.336 --> 01:25:31.590
was gonna sponsor busloads of our students
to come to Detroit.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:36.512
So we had a huge contingency
of fans show up,

01:25:38.388 --> 01:25:39.556
and it was a scene.

01:25:46.522 --> 01:25:47.940
Hi, Mrs. Curry.

01:25:49.483 --> 01:25:52.027
Yeah!

01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:56.281
Go! Go, go, go! Yeah!
Defense! Defense! Defense!

01:26:13.924 --> 01:26:17.427
Curry, four to shoot.
He's gotta fire and does.

01:26:17.511 --> 01:26:20.347
And has! That's another three.

01:26:21.181 --> 01:26:25.102
Richards, he's got Curry on the wing.
He's gonna spot up. There he goes.

01:26:27.437 --> 01:26:28.564
And rips it!

01:26:29.273 --> 01:26:32.568
Folks, we got a star in the Motor City!

01:26:35.237 --> 01:26:36.655
Finds a cutting Curry.

01:26:36.738 --> 01:26:39.616
Oh, my goodness!

01:26:41.410 --> 01:26:42.452
Young fella!

01:26:51.837 --> 01:26:53.714
And how about this?

01:26:53.797 --> 01:26:58.427
The Davidson Wildcats
running Wisconsin out of the gym.

01:27:08.645 --> 01:27:11.440
This is incredible.
We're about to go to the Elite Eight!

01:27:14.234 --> 01:27:15.736
This is amazing.

01:27:17.696 --> 01:27:19.031
Are you crying?

01:27:26.330 --> 01:27:28.457
As a Davidson sports fan,

01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:33.128
that game almost
rejiggered my expectations.

01:27:34.755 --> 01:27:39.051
It was no longer what a thrill,
and in some ways, what a surprise.

01:27:39.134 --> 01:27:40.135
It was…

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:44.306
"Is--
Are they the best team in the country?"

01:27:53.023 --> 01:27:54.608
Downtown Detroit,

01:27:55.317 --> 01:27:58.028
we are ready
for the Midwest Regional final.

01:27:58.111 --> 01:28:01.406
Top-seeded Kansas
against tenth-seeded Davidson.

01:28:03.742 --> 01:28:04.868
Tell you what,

01:28:04.952 --> 01:28:07.788
Davidson has played killers
this year, folks.

01:28:08.539 --> 01:28:11.542
They are not afraid of this Kansas team.

01:28:15.212 --> 01:28:18.882
I looked at Kansas, and I thought,

01:28:20.050 --> 01:28:21.969
"The pressure that they're under."

01:28:22.803 --> 01:28:27.140
Can you imagine Kansas loses to Davidson
to get to the Final Four?

01:28:29.101 --> 01:28:30.227
This was our moment.

01:28:32.354 --> 01:28:33.355
Take what is yours.

01:28:35.983 --> 01:28:39.361
Puts it on the floor.
To the bucket. Left-hand scoop!

01:28:43.657 --> 01:28:44.867
Curry again.

01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:46.577
And buries it.

01:28:52.207 --> 01:28:54.877
Tough shot. And it counts!

01:28:56.211 --> 01:28:57.838
Chalmers. Lobs it.

01:28:58.380 --> 01:29:01.550
Sasha Kaun bangs it down! And the foul.

01:29:02.968 --> 01:29:04.636
Barr. He hits it from deep.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:07.347
Barr again deep in the corner.
And hits it again!

01:29:07.431 --> 01:29:12.227
Barr again from downtown.
The White Lobster is cookin'!

01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:17.441
And a steal.

01:29:17.524 --> 01:29:20.903
Chalmers drives straight to the basket
and lays it in.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:23.488
Arthur, wheeling.

01:29:24.656 --> 01:29:27.784
Jayhawks, a minute away
from the Final Four.

01:29:28.744 --> 01:29:30.412
Curry lets it go.

01:29:30.495 --> 01:29:31.747
And buries it!

01:29:32.497 --> 01:29:34.541
59-57.

01:29:35.751 --> 01:29:38.420
Three to shoot. Lets it go!

01:29:38.504 --> 01:29:40.088
Off the front rim. No.

01:29:41.048 --> 01:29:43.050
And with 16.8 to go,

01:29:43.133 --> 01:29:45.511
Davidson with life.

01:29:47.679 --> 01:29:49.348
Two-point game.

01:29:49.431 --> 01:29:51.517
A Final Four slot on the line.

01:29:58.649 --> 01:30:01.235
Here's Curry. He may not give this up.

01:30:06.823 --> 01:30:08.659
Against a team like Kansas,

01:30:10.244 --> 01:30:12.412
there was just another level
that we got to.

01:30:14.706 --> 01:30:17.042
We put ourselves in a position
to win the game.

01:30:18.043 --> 01:30:20.128
All the way down to that last possession.

01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:22.881
Frees himself, Curry.

01:30:26.343 --> 01:30:28.053
We had done everything possible.

01:30:30.138 --> 01:30:32.099
We did everything right.

01:30:35.519 --> 01:30:36.520
We had them.

01:30:38.939 --> 01:30:42.025
And for everyone in the arena…

01:30:44.403 --> 01:30:47.030
it was a moment that time had stopped.

01:30:58.083 --> 01:30:59.960
And as the buzzer went off,

01:31:01.128 --> 01:31:05.465
I see the coach of Kansas, Bill Self,
on the other sideline

01:31:07.092 --> 01:31:10.512
falling to his knees with his hands
in his face as the shot missed.

01:31:11.763 --> 01:31:14.725
Pumps. Kicks it out. Richards.

01:31:14.808 --> 01:31:16.685
That is it!

01:31:17.227 --> 01:31:20.314
Kansas holds on!

01:31:20.397 --> 01:31:23.150
And the Jayhawks are heading
to the Final Four.

01:31:50.969 --> 01:31:52.513
We had emptied our tank.

01:31:56.266 --> 01:32:01.104
And everyone felt the pain

01:32:02.439 --> 01:32:04.483
that individually Jason felt…

01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:08.278
because he took that shot.

01:32:14.409 --> 01:32:17.079
It really didn't hit me until,
like, the locker room.

01:32:19.915 --> 01:32:23.210
It's like the family, you know?

01:32:23.293 --> 01:32:26.463
It's, like, not that you let,
like, the team down,

01:32:26.547 --> 01:32:27.881
but, like, it's…

01:32:30.509 --> 01:32:35.013
Like, that's the last thing,
you don't wanna let your teammate down.

01:32:35.097 --> 01:32:36.306
Like, that's the whole part.

01:32:40.018 --> 01:32:44.231
But it wasn't so much about,
"We're not going to the Final Four."

01:32:46.275 --> 01:32:49.194
It was,
"We're never gonna play again together."

01:32:49.736 --> 01:32:52.823
Because Thomas, myself and Boris
were graduating.

01:32:53.407 --> 01:32:55.617
So it was kinda like the end of an era.

01:32:58.620 --> 01:33:00.581
I had to know what
that was gonna mean for me

01:33:00.664 --> 01:33:02.249
coming back the next year.

01:33:06.336 --> 01:33:13.051
But I think about what Jay Rich
and Thomas and Max and Boris

01:33:13.135 --> 01:33:18.015
all meant to, like,
me and my confidence as a player,

01:33:18.098 --> 01:33:21.685
and, like, you don't do anything
in this life by yourself.

01:33:21.768 --> 01:33:24.438
And, you know, like, the confidence
of the group is your superpower.

01:33:24.521 --> 01:33:27.482
And those four guys unlocked that for me.

01:33:36.408 --> 01:33:37.409
You go first.

01:33:41.705 --> 01:33:42.873
Good morning, everybody.

01:33:43.457 --> 01:33:44.875
Thanks for coming today.

01:33:47.544 --> 01:33:53.008
After a lot of discussion with my
parents, Coach McKillop and my teammates,

01:33:54.051 --> 01:34:00.015
I have decided to forgo my senior year
and enter the NBA draft this year.

01:34:02.226 --> 01:34:05.812
The last three years have been some
of the most enjoyable times of my life,

01:34:05.896 --> 01:34:07.231
both on and off the court,

01:34:07.314 --> 01:34:09.816
and I will always cherish
my time here at Davidson.

01:34:11.527 --> 01:34:14.029
I wanna thank Coach McKillop
and our coaching staff

01:34:14.112 --> 01:34:16.240
for just giving me a chance to do well.

01:34:17.407 --> 01:34:20.702
And I hope to finish what I started
and get a Davidson degree at some point.

01:34:26.875 --> 01:34:29.211
I've been incredibly fortunate…

01:34:33.757 --> 01:34:36.718
to have this opportunity to coach him
for these three years.

01:34:40.472 --> 01:34:45.185
You know, we're here with a sense of
sadness. Almost like we're at a funeral.

01:34:45.769 --> 01:34:48.063
But we also have
a tremendous balance in life.

01:34:48.146 --> 01:34:49.523
There's a celebration here.

01:34:49.606 --> 01:34:51.984
Celebration
of what this young man represents.

01:34:52.526 --> 01:34:56.989
And we're just thrilled
for this opportunity for him,

01:34:57.072 --> 01:35:01.159
and we know that he's gonna
continue to wear Davidson on his heart

01:35:01.243 --> 01:35:03.412
as he has done for these past three years.

01:35:07.666 --> 01:35:09.042
He cherished it.

01:35:10.169 --> 01:35:13.380
And giving up something
that you cherish is never easy,

01:35:15.174 --> 01:35:17.968
but he felt he was ready
for that next step in his journey.

01:35:30.439 --> 01:35:35.694
The Golden State Warriors select
Stephen Curry from Davidson College.

01:35:41.658 --> 01:35:44.119
The question is,
can he make the transition?

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.706
Is he gonna be strong enough
against NBA defenders

01:35:47.789 --> 01:35:49.750
over the course of an 82-game schedule?

01:35:56.298 --> 01:35:57.633
And there's just this sense

01:35:57.716 --> 01:36:00.219
that he's not a big-time athlete
on the basketball floor.

01:36:00.302 --> 01:36:02.971
So it's gonna be interesting to see
where he pans out.

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:11.271
Steph is hurt. Steph Curry is hurt.

01:36:11.772 --> 01:36:13.815
Shot clock down to five seconds.

01:36:14.399 --> 01:36:16.276
Uh-oh. And you don't wanna see that.

01:36:17.444 --> 01:36:18.820
I don't know what happened.

01:36:20.656 --> 01:36:22.491
Curry hurt his foot again.

01:36:22.991 --> 01:36:24.493
Just heartbreaking.

01:36:26.328 --> 01:36:28.622
-Same ankle.
-Look at that.

01:36:28.705 --> 01:36:30.415
Holy macaron--

01:36:30.499 --> 01:36:32.709
Over and over and over again.

01:36:34.211 --> 01:36:37.047
Curry underwent surgery
on his right ankle.

01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:39.341
He will miss three to four months.

01:36:43.095 --> 01:36:45.055
Over. Good.

01:36:55.148 --> 01:36:56.942
Curry through the lane. And in!

01:36:57.818 --> 01:36:59.695
How did he make that?

01:37:00.612 --> 01:37:02.698
-Curry splits the defense.
-Behind the back.

01:37:03.282 --> 01:37:05.492
Fires a three. It's good!

01:37:05.576 --> 01:37:07.703
And the dream season is complete.

01:37:07.786 --> 01:37:11.498
The Golden State Warriors
are the 2015 NBA champions.

01:37:11.582 --> 01:37:14.209
Their first title in 40 years.

01:37:15.794 --> 01:37:20.257
There it is.
The Warriors are NBA champions again.

01:37:21.925 --> 01:37:24.511
There's a new dynasty in the NBA.

01:37:24.595 --> 01:37:27.055
Back-to-back titles. Three in four years.

01:37:29.892 --> 01:37:32.019
Thompson grabs his left knee.

01:37:32.603 --> 01:37:34.104
Now writhing in pain.

01:37:35.564 --> 01:37:36.940
It's over.

01:37:37.024 --> 01:37:40.861
The Raptors, the 2019 NBA champs.

01:37:42.946 --> 01:37:44.531
This is how it ends.

01:37:44.615 --> 01:37:47.367
The Warriors dynasty,
I think it ends tonight.

01:37:48.076 --> 01:37:51.079
We will never
see Steph in another NBA Finals ever.

01:37:51.163 --> 01:37:52.497
They have no path forward.

01:37:52.581 --> 01:37:54.917
This group will not
make the playoffs next year.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.169
Players get old, injured.

01:37:57.252 --> 01:37:58.795
Curry can't do it.

01:37:58.879 --> 01:38:01.798
He's dripping sweat.
There's just nothing left.

01:38:16.563 --> 01:38:18.690
Tough shot. Got it.

01:38:22.528 --> 01:38:28.075
And the Golden State Warriors
dispatch the Nuggets in five games.

01:38:31.161 --> 01:38:35.123
It's gonna be a different
series now against the Memphis Grizzlies.

01:38:35.207 --> 01:38:37.793
This Warriors team's
not winning more playoff games.

01:38:37.876 --> 01:38:39.920
It is impossible for me to believe.

01:38:41.630 --> 01:38:46.385
Curry dishing.
Looney, extra D. To Green for the flush.

01:38:46.468 --> 01:38:50.347
Thompson, back to Curry.
Curry, a three. He got it!

01:38:51.598 --> 01:38:57.187
The Golden State Warriors are heading back
to the Western Conference Finals.

01:38:58.689 --> 01:39:01.567
I'm still not
completely sold on Golden State.

01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:06.738
Is Steph tall enough? Strong enough?
Defensive enough?

01:39:08.156 --> 01:39:13.203
It was blocked by Curry.
Blocked by Curry on the three.

01:39:13.287 --> 01:39:14.705
Curry shooting.

01:39:16.915 --> 01:39:18.125
They're on their feet,

01:39:18.208 --> 01:39:24.256
and their Warriors
are going to the NBA Finals again.

01:39:27.384 --> 01:39:30.637
With Golden State,
I don't see how they win this series.

01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:32.973
I like the Boston Celtics.

01:39:33.056 --> 01:39:34.558
Like the Celtics in six.

01:39:34.641 --> 01:39:36.935
The Celtics are winning it all. Period.

01:39:38.478 --> 01:39:41.732
Tatum on the drive.
Kicks it out. Smart, corner three.

01:39:44.026 --> 01:39:46.278
Gets it back. Layup blocked by Brown.

01:39:46.945 --> 01:39:48.822
Boston Celtics take game three.

01:39:48.906 --> 01:39:50.741
They're two wins away from a title.

01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:54.953
Now the Warriors
have to win three out of four.

01:39:55.037 --> 01:39:56.997
Even the most die-hard Warriors fan's

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.790
gonna say that's very unlikely.

01:39:59.374 --> 01:40:01.126
The Celtics look like the better team.

01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:04.171
The Celtics are the younger team.
They're the more athletic team.

01:40:04.254 --> 01:40:06.423
We talk about what kind
of player you have to have

01:40:06.507 --> 01:40:07.799
to win a championship.

01:40:07.883 --> 01:40:09.593
If Steph Curry isn't that, who is?

01:40:09.676 --> 01:40:11.428
Well, he's borderline not that now.

01:40:11.512 --> 01:40:12.971
I have yet to see

01:40:13.055 --> 01:40:17.226
a no-excuses-Steph-led Warriors team
win a championship.

01:40:20.312 --> 01:40:23.774
Curry with a beautiful move
and off the glass.

01:40:23.857 --> 01:40:25.651
Curry steps back. Three pointer. Got it.

01:40:26.193 --> 01:40:27.945
Another long-distance shot. It's good!

01:40:28.028 --> 01:40:30.822
Steph Curry launches a three. Curry again.

01:40:31.907 --> 01:40:35.702
Steph Curry from way downtown.
He's got 30 points.

01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.956
What a performance from Stephen Curry.

01:40:39.039 --> 01:40:41.667
The NBA Finals are tied
at two games apiece,

01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:46.255
as the brilliance of Steph Curry
on full display here in Boston.

01:40:47.714 --> 01:40:49.925
Curry goes coast to coast,
lays it up and in.

01:40:50.008 --> 01:40:52.845
Curry to Wiggins.
Wiggins, the layup. It's good.

01:40:52.928 --> 01:40:58.809
Wiggins drives and finishes!
Exclamation point from Andrew Wiggins.

01:41:00.644 --> 01:41:04.189
Curry drives on Smart.
Gets inside. Left-handed, banks it home.

01:41:04.273 --> 01:41:06.233
Curry catches. Fakes.

01:41:06.316 --> 01:41:08.569
Fires three-pointer. Bang!

01:41:08.652 --> 01:41:12.364
Steph Curry from downtown.
A 15-point lead.

01:41:17.411 --> 01:41:20.789
The realization is underway
for Golden State.

01:41:27.212 --> 01:41:29.298
Steph Curry getting emotional.

01:41:30.674 --> 01:41:33.302
It might be his fourth,
but it means so much.

01:42:02.539 --> 01:42:06.460
Come on, 30! Come on, 30! Come on!

01:42:06.543 --> 01:42:08.629
-Get my family up here.
-I'm gonna get 'em for you.

01:42:08.712 --> 01:42:10.255
-My family…
-I'm gonna get 'em for you.

01:42:16.595 --> 01:42:20.015
You gonna have red lipstick.
What the hell just happened?

01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:25.604
He's a four-time NBA champion.

01:42:26.688 --> 01:42:28.941
A two-time league MVP.

01:42:29.525 --> 01:42:31.652
And for the first time ever,

01:42:31.735 --> 01:42:35.906
the NBA Finals MVP award
goes to Stephen Curry!

01:42:37.074 --> 01:42:40.994
MVP! MVP! MVP!

01:42:41.078 --> 01:42:46.708
MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP! MVP!

01:42:50.504 --> 01:42:52.756
Yeah!

01:43:12.276 --> 01:43:13.735
How did I get here?

01:43:14.987 --> 01:43:17.865
If you walked into a gym
and saw me 20 years ago,

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:21.535
there's no way you would think
any of this was possible.

01:43:24.288 --> 01:43:27.583
And that feeling
of being overlooked or underrated

01:43:28.625 --> 01:43:31.587
will always be part of the drive
that keeps me going.

01:43:34.173 --> 01:43:37.801
But also, I've just been blessed
to have so many people in my life

01:43:37.885 --> 01:43:42.931
that took the time to get the sense
of who I really was.

01:43:45.559 --> 01:43:47.227
I'll remember that forever.

01:43:54.818 --> 01:43:58.822
We are extremely proud
to call ourselves your home team,

01:43:59.907 --> 01:44:03.285
your base of support,
your cheering section.

01:44:04.745 --> 01:44:08.582
I mean the entire Davidson community
who stands with you

01:44:08.665 --> 01:44:11.543
and surrounds you
with our hearts and our minds.

01:44:14.755 --> 01:44:16.423
It would have been so easy,

01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:20.344
so straightforward
not to complete your college degree.

01:44:21.762 --> 01:44:26.475
But he did it.
And this is a dream come true for me.

01:44:27.059 --> 01:44:30.938
I am so thankful and blessed
to be able to look at you,

01:44:31.855 --> 01:44:35.817
see you with your gown on officially,

01:44:35.901 --> 01:44:38.904
knowing you earned this.

01:44:40.447 --> 01:44:42.658
Wardell Stephen Curry II,

01:44:43.617 --> 01:44:47.204
I hereby affirm
the degree of Bachelor of Arts.

01:44:47.287 --> 01:44:48.664
Congratulations.

01:45:31.290 --> 01:45:35.294
This is an absolutely
amazing day, an amazing moment.

01:45:37.004 --> 01:45:39.256
Every single person
that I got to play with

01:45:39.756 --> 01:45:42.801
lives with me every single time
that I step foot on the court.

01:45:43.468 --> 01:45:45.971
It speaks to how much
this place means to me.

01:45:47.556 --> 01:45:49.308
But most importantly,

01:45:49.391 --> 01:45:52.144
I played for an amazing man.

01:45:53.520 --> 01:45:55.814
Somebody who has so much compassion,

01:45:56.356 --> 01:45:57.983
care,

01:45:58.066 --> 01:46:01.570
love for every single person
that you come in contact with.

01:46:03.322 --> 01:46:05.282
None of this is possible without you.

01:46:47.282 --> 01:46:49.368
All right, Steph. Ready?

01:46:55.249 --> 01:47:00.087
Top two. Wing three. Top two. Wing three.
Here we go.

01:47:02.881 --> 01:47:04.216
One.

01:47:06.134 --> 01:47:07.135
Two.

01:47:08.011 --> 01:47:09.930
-Three.
-Yeah!

01:47:37.541 --> 01:47:40.335
"Needs to add some muscle
to his upper body

01:47:40.419 --> 01:47:43.463
but appears as though
he'll always be skinny."

01:47:44.506 --> 01:47:50.095
They said the same thing,
the exact same thing, about me.

01:47:51.013 --> 01:47:54.558
I think what surprised me the most

01:47:54.641 --> 01:47:58.187
was his ability to shoot from deep.

01:47:58.270 --> 01:48:01.607
-Is he feeling it?
-Yes. Steph three.

01:48:01.690 --> 01:48:03.317
Got another one!

01:48:04.484 --> 01:48:09.072
He changed how people view the NBA now.

01:48:09.156 --> 01:48:10.199
One player.

01:48:10.282 --> 01:48:15.871
All 30 teams now base their play
off the three-point line,

01:48:17.039 --> 01:48:18.916
and that is because of Stephen Curry.

01:48:19.958 --> 01:48:23.962
Bang! Bang! What a shot from Curry!

01:48:24.046 --> 01:48:28.258
And he ties the NBA record
with his 12th three-pointer of the game.
