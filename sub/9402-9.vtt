WEBVTT

00:01.132 --> 00:02.762
<i>Thank you, Ms. Davis.</i>

00:02.844 --> 00:05.164
As of this moment,
your ownership is terminated,

00:05.247 --> 00:06.931
and you are no longer affiliated

00:07.016 --> 00:09.101
with the Clothes Over Bros brand.

00:09.184 --> 00:10.598
You have a rock star

00:10.681 --> 00:12.366
and a famous actress
fighting over you,

00:12.449 --> 00:14.437
and you're not sure
you want to be with either one?

00:14.520 --> 00:15.951
They both kind of screwed me up.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.426
So maybe you should move on.

00:17.509 --> 00:18.660
Trick or treat!

00:18.743 --> 00:20.941
Aren't you a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

00:21.024 --> 00:22.231
Is my son here?

00:22.314 --> 00:23.383
Mom?

00:23.693 --> 00:25.203
Oh, please, God, no.

00:25.286 --> 00:26.553
Millie, you ready to go?

00:26.636 --> 00:27.759
I found a ride.

00:27.842 --> 00:29.348
You're going home with Spartacus?

00:29.431 --> 00:31.056
Just playing by your rules.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.700
You're gonna be great at this.

00:33.783 --> 00:35.305
Troy must agree with me

00:35.388 --> 00:37.385
because he wants you
to be his Agent.

00:37.959 --> 00:40.164
Congratulations,
you signed your first client.

00:41.590 --> 00:43.820
I think you should take
that photo assignment,

00:43.903 --> 00:45.499
the one in South Africa.

00:45.582 --> 00:47.797
Why?
Because this will save you.

00:50.360 --> 00:51.522
This won't.

00:54.277 --> 00:55.373
I'll go.

01:01.101 --> 01:02.353
<i>Dear Lucas,</i>

01:02.751 --> 01:05.248
<i>I can't believe
it's already Thanksgiving.</i>

01:05.965 --> 01:08.006
<i>Remember the time
we shared the wishbone?</i>

01:08.089 --> 01:11.496
<i>You got the bigger side,
but you let me make the wish.</i>

01:12.330 --> 01:13.539
<i>That day, I wished</i>

01:13.622 --> 01:16.167
<i>that we'd always find the good
in our lives.</i>

01:21.833 --> 01:25.079
<i>I'm pretty sure that can come
true whenever we want it to.</i>

01:25.312 --> 01:28.162
<i>So, I'm gonna make today
about the good,</i>

01:29.185 --> 01:31.104
<i>because there's so much of it.</i>

01:39.210 --> 01:40.950
Brooke Davis in the kitchen.

01:41.033 --> 01:42.751
Is it wrong
that I'm getting turned on?

01:42.834 --> 01:44.947
A little bit.
I'm trying to be domestic.

01:45.030 --> 01:46.959
Domestic Brooke is cute.

01:48.015 --> 01:49.051
Hang on.

01:50.170 --> 01:51.320
What's this?

01:51.921 --> 01:53.198
Apple crisp.

01:57.170 --> 01:59.118
Good morning, pilgrims.

01:59.624 --> 02:01.235
Guess what, Julian.

02:01.318 --> 02:04.328
I got the ingredients for your
favorite -- the Fluffy salad.

02:04.411 --> 02:05.473
- Yes!
- Yes.

02:08.203 --> 02:10.295
Is that an apple peel?

02:12.675 --> 02:14.293
It's rustic.

02:14.833 --> 02:16.312
It's interesting.

02:16.395 --> 02:17.895
Hope no one chokes.

02:21.966 --> 02:24.310
It says three pounds apples.

02:25.661 --> 02:26.719
Peeled.

02:33.030 --> 02:34.321
All right.
Nate.

02:35.254 --> 02:36.815
Jame, go long.
Go!

02:38.000 --> 02:39.362
No, not that long.

02:40.581 --> 02:42.106
You should probably throw this.

02:44.434 --> 02:45.439
Nice.

02:46.264 --> 02:48.405
So, we should probably make
this Agent thing official.

02:48.488 --> 02:50.270
I thought we already did that --
with Troy.

02:50.607 --> 02:53.070
Sort of, you know, but you got
to take the test to get certified.

02:53.153 --> 02:54.396
It's a piece of cake.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.484
Just get me
your college transcripts,

02:56.567 --> 02:58.166
and -- and I'll set it all up.

03:02.777 --> 03:04.732
Remember when we took
that road trip to New York

03:04.815 --> 03:06.454
so I could get Millie back?

03:07.763 --> 03:09.127
Dude, really?

03:11.153 --> 03:12.483
Pink charlene, baby.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.454
This will change your life.

03:16.068 --> 03:17.718
Millie loves parades.

03:18.328 --> 03:21.294
Dawg, seriously,
no more talk about Millie, okay?

03:22.131 --> 03:24.029
Now, look, man,
it's Thanksgiving, bro.

03:24.112 --> 03:26.890
I ordered us a nice organic,
farm-fresh turkey,

03:26.973 --> 03:28.892
and we about to get our eat on.

03:30.058 --> 03:31.203
You hear that?

03:31.286 --> 03:33.521
Turkey time!
I'll be back.

03:41.248 --> 03:42.405
Oh, damn.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.002
I thought you was the turkey.

03:45.638 --> 03:47.101
Gobble, gobble.

03:48.666 --> 03:50.688
Yeah.
I won't ever do that again.

03:53.084 --> 03:55.369
Millie, hi.
Happy Thanksgiving.

03:55.452 --> 03:57.521
Uh, the parade's on.
I'm watching it.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.723
Hi, Marvin.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.905
Um, I thought you might be watching.

04:01.461 --> 04:03.450
I didn't want to watch it alone.
It felt sad.

04:03.738 --> 04:06.252
I thought you might be spending
the day with that gladiator guy.

04:06.335 --> 04:07.518
From Halloween?

04:08.457 --> 04:09.503
No.

04:09.697 --> 04:12.334
That pretty much ended when
he asked me to polish his sword.

04:14.180 --> 04:15.180
Gross.

04:16.392 --> 04:19.300
It kind of seems like
you were a little jealous.

04:19.468 --> 04:20.468
No.

04:20.925 --> 04:22.178
Well, maybe.

04:24.462 --> 04:25.562
Okay, a lot.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:36.330 --> 04:38.081
That is a lot of food.

04:38.164 --> 04:41.736
Seriously, it's just the four of us.
Four and a half, counting the baby.

04:41.819 --> 04:45.803
Five and a half, actually. I invited
Erin. And people always show up.

04:45.886 --> 04:49.272
I'll be happy for leftovers. I cannot
handle any more canned food.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.705
Get out of there.

04:51.366 --> 04:53.385
Don't forget to save
the wishbone for me.

04:53.704 --> 04:55.459
- I won't. Go.
- Yes.

05:03.276 --> 05:07.821
"In large saucepan, place parsley,
carrots, celery, black pepper."

05:08.206 --> 05:09.851
Okay, 10 cups water... did that.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.871
Neck and giblets.
Oh, my God, gross.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.788
What happened?
I don't know, but make it stop.

05:32.084 --> 05:34.499
- Oh, God! I'm blind!
- My God !

05:34.582 --> 05:36.452
What is it? What is it? What?

05:36.810 --> 05:39.880
- All right, I got it, I got it.
- No, no!

05:51.576 --> 05:53.526
Maybe we could scrape it off.

06:01.709 --> 06:04.189
Nathan, three more settings
at the table.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.624
Happy Thanksgiving?

06:06.950 --> 06:09.293
Okay, I got the pink charlene
chilling in the fridge.

06:09.378 --> 06:11.556
Now it's on to the cheesy potatoes.

06:11.849 --> 06:13.443
What's "pink charlene"?

06:13.868 --> 06:15.553
It's basically jello salad.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.167
I love jello salad.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.238
Oh, you about to get
some jello salad, baby.

06:19.476 --> 06:21.427
Plus, we got cheesy potatoes

06:21.510 --> 06:23.382
and a sweet, succulent bird.

06:23.782 --> 06:25.801
And not to mention,
it's farm fresh, by the way.

06:26.187 --> 06:27.886
He's very excited about that part.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.024
You know, speaking of sweet
and succulent,

06:31.901 --> 06:34.027
Millie, what's up with you
and the gladiator dude?

06:37.442 --> 06:39.900
Oh, look at that. Saved by the bell.

06:42.927 --> 06:45.758
- I'm glad Chase gave you the day off.
- Yeah, me too.

06:45.841 --> 06:48.787
He was gonna close the bar,
but he decided to leave it open

06:48.870 --> 06:51.320
for all the people
with nowhere to go.

07:48.444 --> 07:49.444
One purse.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.745
Assorted jewelry.

07:52.157 --> 07:53.931
One replenishing night serum.

07:54.868 --> 07:57.034
One super-firming serum.

07:58.575 --> 08:02.266
One multi-active
youth-recovery cream.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.233
Is it necessary to read every label?

08:04.564 --> 08:05.910
Standard procedure.

08:07.049 --> 08:08.574
One cellphone.

08:08.657 --> 08:11.614
One tin of breath mints.
And $20.

08:12.976 --> 08:14.067
Sign here.

08:17.925 --> 08:19.423
I'm gonna miss you.

08:25.734 --> 08:27.214
Happy Thanksgiving.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.308
<i>La Ravens Team présente...</i>

09:22.943 --> 09:25.293
Be prepared.
Farm fresh has arrived.

09:30.990 --> 09:31.990
Turkey!

09:35.325 --> 09:36.707
Is that the turkey?

09:37.728 --> 09:38.744
Sort of.

09:42.645 --> 09:44.795
Well, it's definitely farm fresh.

09:45.688 --> 09:46.688
Not funny.

09:49.111 --> 09:51.208
- What are you doing?
- We eating him.

09:51.291 --> 09:54.065
- I am not okay with this.
- Dude, you can't just kill him.

09:54.148 --> 09:57.425
How in the hell you think that the
turkey you eat ended up on your plate?

09:57.508 --> 10:00.148
Now, damn it, it's turkey day,
and we eating turkey.

10:00.481 --> 10:02.698
Do you have to call it "turkey day"?

10:08.906 --> 10:09.906
Damn it.

10:15.768 --> 10:17.297
Nathan, three more.

10:24.856 --> 10:26.056
Look how cute.

10:26.517 --> 10:28.210
You two are making little...

10:28.625 --> 10:29.625
Turkeys.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.506
You want to make one?

10:32.848 --> 10:33.848
No.

10:34.978 --> 10:37.219
But do you know where your mom
keeps the wine?

10:38.654 --> 10:40.634
- Let me check.
- Thanks.

10:42.239 --> 10:43.239
Cute.

10:45.459 --> 10:47.209
Any word from your mom...

10:47.897 --> 10:49.060
Yet today?

10:49.485 --> 10:52.089
Oh, no.
And I am very thankful.

10:52.528 --> 10:55.484
Although I do wonder if they'll
be serving turkey in prison.

10:57.100 --> 11:00.951
Well, don't you think it's a good idea
to at least wish her a happy holiday?

11:04.956 --> 11:06.189
Are you serious?

11:08.448 --> 11:09.448
No.

11:10.156 --> 11:12.629
I think that would be
a horrible idea

11:12.797 --> 11:15.650
given the awful things that she
said to me the last time we spoke.

11:15.733 --> 11:19.015
I think I'd likely
tell her to choke on a yam

11:19.098 --> 11:21.395
or shove a turkey up her...

11:23.214 --> 11:25.521
Anyway, I'm just really glad

11:25.604 --> 11:28.270
to have a drama-free holiday
with you guys.

11:32.018 --> 11:33.918
I'm gonna go find that wine.

12:12.319 --> 12:14.458
I wish Quinn were here.
I miss her.

12:14.737 --> 12:16.996
Still can't dribble
with the left, huh?

12:18.724 --> 12:21.408
I thought she was supposed to
be back from Africa by now.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.993
Yeah, she was, but she had
to extend a week. She'll be back soon.

12:27.736 --> 12:30.036
So, the transcripts that you need...

12:32.015 --> 12:33.377
I never graduated.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.352
I'm a few credits short.

12:38.980 --> 12:40.384
How many is a few?

12:41.306 --> 12:42.701
Does it matter?

12:43.472 --> 12:44.728
Yeah, it does.

12:45.346 --> 12:47.963
You've got to have
a college degree to do this,

12:48.322 --> 12:50.166
and you're clearly good at it,

12:50.249 --> 12:52.652
so I think you should
go get those credits.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.772
Hey, thanks again
for letting us come.

12:58.855 --> 13:01.221
I don't know how I managed
to set a turkey on fire.

13:01.304 --> 13:03.729
I don't know, either.
At least it wasn't a piano.

13:03.812 --> 13:04.933
True.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.264
Hey, is it okay if Alex joins?

13:07.347 --> 13:09.417
She was supposed to come
to our house, and...

13:10.375 --> 13:11.930
Normally I would say yes, but...

13:12.235 --> 13:14.608
Mia called and
she said she's coming over.

13:14.691 --> 13:17.587
And I just think that might be kind
of awkward for the both of them.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.566
Right.
And if I already invited her?

13:43.548 --> 13:44.745
Jello salad?

13:45.436 --> 13:47.576
I hear it's a popular dish
in the states.

13:47.854 --> 13:50.321
Very. I'm glad you could
make it. Come in.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.609
That's 20.
Yeah, baby.

13:56.586 --> 13:59.520
Bro, you are an NBA star,
and I'm kicking your ass.

13:59.603 --> 14:01.616
Dude, it's cornhole.
Relax.

14:02.125 --> 14:03.175
Just sayin'.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.636
Really?

14:05.719 --> 14:07.467
I got shot.
What do you expect?

14:07.550 --> 14:08.600
Right here.

14:08.929 --> 14:12.142
Man, it is some fine ladies
in the Scott house today.

14:12.436 --> 14:14.589
You must've met Erin.
She's cute, huh?

14:14.672 --> 14:16.922
Yeah, but I'm talking about Sylvia.

14:17.484 --> 14:19.484
- Dude, that's my mom.
- Yes.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.290
Delicious.

14:22.017 --> 14:24.446
- Is he serious?
- Trust me. He's serious.

14:25.838 --> 14:26.838
Sylvia.

14:28.283 --> 14:29.633
Say "cornucopia".

14:29.716 --> 14:30.940
Cornucopia.

14:31.884 --> 14:33.134
Say "stuffing".

14:33.398 --> 14:34.398
Stuffing.

14:34.980 --> 14:37.292
- Your accent is so cool.
- Yours too.

14:38.235 --> 14:40.513
- I don't have one.
- Sure you do.

14:41.784 --> 14:44.029
Why aren't you with your parents
for Thanksgiving?

14:44.112 --> 14:46.512
We don't celebrate Thanksgiving
in Ireland.

14:46.962 --> 14:49.766
- Do you celebrate Christmas?
- Yep.

14:50.670 --> 14:52.801
Will you be with your parents then?

14:53.780 --> 14:56.686
Well, I don't talk to my mom
and dad so much.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.172
'Cause they live in Ireland?

14:59.893 --> 15:00.893
Sort of.

15:02.059 --> 15:04.278
We really don't get along very well.

15:04.650 --> 15:07.243
- 'Cause you had a fight?
- Yeah.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.451
We had a fight.

15:10.074 --> 15:11.074
Say...

15:11.440 --> 15:12.540
"Turducken."

15:13.488 --> 15:14.488
Turducken.

15:17.771 --> 15:18.792
Hey, bitch.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.176
- I've missed you.
- Me too.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.554
Tell me Hollywoody stories
and let me live vicariously.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.362
You mean boring stories?

15:25.445 --> 15:28.006
Work, diet, work, diet,
think about Chase...

15:28.089 --> 15:29.530
Think about Chase some more.

15:30.398 --> 15:32.617
- I was hoping for glamorous.
- Yeah, not so much.

15:32.727 --> 15:35.433
Okay, your turn.
Indulge me on small-town secrets,

15:35.601 --> 15:37.811
especially
if they're dirty or about Chase.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.048
I'm boring, too.

15:39.131 --> 15:42.888
I have been looking for work,
looking for work, looking for work.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.949
And thinking about Marvin.

15:45.032 --> 15:46.903
You mean hooking up with Marvin?

15:46.986 --> 15:48.590
No, just thinking.

15:48.843 --> 15:51.944
I mean, we were hooking up,
and then we stopped, and now...

15:52.027 --> 15:54.563
You're thinking about
hooking up with Marvin.

15:54.902 --> 15:55.902
Yeah.

16:00.035 --> 16:01.368
I'll be right back.

16:14.556 --> 16:18.053
I just want to make sure we're okay,
because we haven't talked in a while,

16:18.136 --> 16:19.815
and if we're not okay...

16:19.898 --> 16:20.948
We're okay.

16:21.677 --> 16:24.787
I don't have an issue with you. I have
an issue with Victoria,

16:24.870 --> 16:26.403
but not with you.

16:27.369 --> 16:29.575
Besides, it's Thanksgiving,

16:29.658 --> 16:32.058
and we have a ton
to be thankful for.

16:32.386 --> 16:35.203
Not Victoria, obviously,
but a lot of other things.

16:35.615 --> 16:38.047
Like that carving knife.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.662
If Victoria were here, I would
be super thankful for it.

16:49.467 --> 16:52.969
Don't worry, Uncle Skills.
That one is not farm fresh.

16:53.361 --> 16:55.011
I named him "Feathers".

16:56.217 --> 16:57.267
Very funny.

16:57.842 --> 16:58.842
So...

16:59.858 --> 17:01.428
Was the turkey cool?

17:01.945 --> 17:03.645
The turkey was not cool.

17:04.709 --> 17:07.233
- Did it scare you at all?
- No.

17:07.401 --> 17:10.528
- Not even a little bit?
- Man, why you ask so many questions?

17:10.695 --> 17:13.512
Well, I know how you felt
about Percy the Iguana,

17:13.804 --> 17:15.743
so if you need any help...

17:16.727 --> 17:17.877
I'm your man.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.781
I'm gonna hold you to that, J-Scott.

17:20.864 --> 17:23.814
You could give him Feathers
to keep him company.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.954
He's probably lonely
on Thanksgiving.

17:27.637 --> 17:28.638
Whatever.

17:29.577 --> 17:30.924
This thing is ugly.

17:39.310 --> 17:41.219
I'm glad I made extra food.

17:41.462 --> 17:42.762
You always know.

17:45.974 --> 17:48.224
So, are you okay?
What's going on?

17:49.110 --> 17:51.983
Well, Clay says
that I need my degree

17:52.066 --> 17:53.816
if I want to be an agent.

17:56.067 --> 17:57.959
Okay. Well, you always
wanted to finish school.

17:58.042 --> 17:59.742
Maybe now's your chance.

17:59.955 --> 18:02.015
School was never easy for me, Hales.

18:02.098 --> 18:03.907
I barely got by.
You know that.

18:06.461 --> 18:07.961
But you found a way.

18:08.414 --> 18:09.703
You always do.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.049
You're gonna be fine.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.848
I don't get it.

18:20.892 --> 18:25.045
Haley's cooking for a small army, and
it looks like a butterball commercial.

18:25.847 --> 18:27.063
How's my bird?

18:27.231 --> 18:29.301
Just how I like it...
dead and cooked.

18:29.384 --> 18:31.276
Okay, well, I was hoping
for golden brown.

18:31.627 --> 18:32.944
Your bird is perfect.

18:34.594 --> 18:37.558
Brooke Davis, I love you
and I'm thankful for you,

18:37.641 --> 18:40.201
and my gift to you
is a day free of filming.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.485
- Really?
- Finally.

18:41.568 --> 18:42.918
Such a good gift.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.900
Brooke? Haley?

18:44.983 --> 18:47.065
Mary?
Anyone care for wine?

18:47.710 --> 18:49.533
- It's Millie.
- Sure.

18:49.616 --> 18:51.463
- Pregnant. Sorry.
- I'm good.

18:51.546 --> 18:54.812
Well, at least someone here is fun.

19:03.166 --> 19:04.184
So not good.

19:13.977 --> 19:15.445
Why are you here?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.598
I just got out of prison.

19:19.681 --> 19:22.994
I don't care if you just crawled
out of your own coffin.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.962
Here we go with the typical
Brooke dramatics.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.465
You want dramatic?

19:27.548 --> 19:30.126
There's a carving knife here
I'm not afraid to use.

19:32.630 --> 19:36.299
The last time I saw you, you told me
you never wanted to speak to me again.

19:37.326 --> 19:38.326
I don't.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.158
Well, neither do I.

19:40.422 --> 19:42.933
So why don't you do us both
a favor and just leave?

19:43.016 --> 19:46.226
Victoria, hello.
I am Sylvia, Julian's mom.

19:47.834 --> 19:50.522
- Hello.
- Victoria was just leaving.

19:51.370 --> 19:52.505
Don't be silly.

19:52.588 --> 19:56.493
A lady gets out of the big house, she
deserves a nice, big glass of Riesling.

19:57.414 --> 19:59.860
Thank you.
Finally, someone with manners.

19:59.943 --> 20:01.574
Hey, Fluffy salad.

20:01.853 --> 20:02.853
Ambrosia.

20:07.282 --> 20:10.797
You're gonna let them bond?
That is such a bad idea.

20:11.253 --> 20:14.829
It'll be fine. They will hate each other
and then hopefully they'll both leave.

20:23.981 --> 20:26.381
Like she's really playing
with Jamie.

20:27.279 --> 20:29.269
They look like they're having fun.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.965
Can't we just poison her drink

20:31.048 --> 20:32.900
or put laxative in her stuffing
or something?

20:32.983 --> 20:34.661
You know what?
You need the green stuff.

20:34.744 --> 20:36.527
Take some and calm down.

20:36.851 --> 20:39.785
If you ain't gonna help me, Erin will.
Do you know any irish curses?

20:39.868 --> 20:42.824
May your pipe never smoke
and your teapot be broke.

20:43.256 --> 20:46.525
May your temples wear horns,
toes many corns.

20:46.871 --> 20:50.219
May you keep to your bed
till the hour you are dead.

20:53.381 --> 20:55.242
It's...Something like that.

20:57.408 --> 20:59.300
I think you need the green stuff.

21:09.094 --> 21:10.394
Cranberry sauce.

21:19.888 --> 21:21.030
Pumpkin pie.

21:30.081 --> 21:31.081
Stuffing.

21:37.984 --> 21:38.984
Oh, my God.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.845
- I'd love some more.
- No problem.

21:48.928 --> 21:51.347
- I'll save your seat.
- Thank you, dear.

21:55.172 --> 21:57.671
You are supposed to be making her
uncomfortable so that she leaves.

21:57.754 --> 21:59.398
And you are over there bonding.

21:59.481 --> 22:02.237
- Why are you bonding?
- It's Thanksgiving, Brooke.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.302
Be thankful. Be kind.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.244
Having fun?

22:09.412 --> 22:11.537
Thankful, my ass.
Thanksgiving sucks.

22:12.743 --> 22:15.124
- You need some of the green stuff.
- Is that a money joke?

22:15.454 --> 22:16.459
Jello salad.

22:19.831 --> 22:21.965
All right, it's time to pick teams.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.552
I pick Uncle Skills.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.611
Pick me. Pick me.

22:26.694 --> 22:27.694
Mouth.

22:29.090 --> 22:30.240
I'll be next.

22:31.459 --> 22:32.459
Aunt Brooke.

22:34.699 --> 22:35.980
Hey, pick Millie.

22:36.506 --> 22:39.774
- Erin, you ever play football?
- Not a day in my life.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.131
I pick Erin.

22:44.254 --> 22:45.254
Millie.

22:46.167 --> 22:47.167
Mia.

22:52.492 --> 22:53.492
Julian.

22:53.831 --> 22:54.831
Sweet!

22:57.931 --> 22:59.755
Actually, I trade for Alex.

23:01.917 --> 23:02.917
What?

23:04.555 --> 23:05.791
Clay, are you playing?

23:05.874 --> 23:08.622
I'd love to, bro,
but, uh, gunshot wound,

23:08.705 --> 23:10.299
kidney transplant.

23:11.312 --> 23:12.312
Nate.

23:13.106 --> 23:15.577
- You sure?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

23:21.476 --> 23:22.876
Ready, set.
Hike!

23:23.895 --> 23:25.153
Uncle Skills!

23:31.744 --> 23:33.619
Yay, Jujube!

23:33.702 --> 23:34.746
Way to go!

23:35.407 --> 23:37.691
You're snuggly
when you play football.

23:40.573 --> 23:42.830
Look, something else
you gave away, Brooke.

23:44.131 --> 23:46.716
But look, the other side
is happy, aren't they?

23:53.681 --> 23:54.881
Come on, guys.

23:54.964 --> 23:56.476
We're on the 1-yard line.

23:56.817 --> 23:57.917
We got this.

24:00.327 --> 24:02.065
Ready, set.
Hike!

24:05.669 --> 24:06.822
Eat it, losers!

24:07.208 --> 24:10.030
Oops, didn't realize
you already scored. My bad.

24:10.628 --> 24:12.241
With Chase or in the game?

24:16.975 --> 24:18.706
- Hi, Marvin.
- Hi, Millie.

24:19.022 --> 24:20.178
I'm gonna crush you.

24:20.261 --> 24:21.720
Ready? And hike.

24:22.586 --> 24:23.810
I'm open, I'm open!

24:26.946 --> 24:28.966
I got the ball!
I got the ball!

24:29.405 --> 24:31.117
She's on the other team.
Come on.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.284
Ready, set.
Hike.

24:42.933 --> 24:43.933
Back off!

24:45.192 --> 24:47.797
All right, all right, all right,
all right, okay, okay.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.074
Let's get it, let's get it.

24:58.587 --> 24:59.637
I'm coming for you.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.624
Ready, set! Hike!

25:04.931 --> 25:05.931
Over here!

25:26.641 --> 25:28.720
I leave and all hell breaks loose.

25:28.803 --> 25:29.853
Aunt Quinn!

25:30.613 --> 25:31.663
Hey, buddy.

25:37.133 --> 25:38.821
- You're back.
- I'm back.

25:51.797 --> 25:52.797
Come here.

25:57.596 --> 25:58.764
How's my girl?

25:59.517 --> 26:01.458
I kind of think
you should take me home.

26:01.541 --> 26:02.541
Right now?

26:02.936 --> 26:04.937
- And skip dinner?
- Yeah.

26:06.225 --> 26:08.860
I've been smelling that turkey
all day. And...

26:09.484 --> 26:12.144
Do you know how long
I've eaten canned food?

26:12.408 --> 26:14.071
Okay, fine.
We'll wait.

26:14.866 --> 26:18.627
No. No way. I'm taking you home
right now. Come on.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.230
Hey, little sis.

26:51.814 --> 26:53.435
I'm so glad that you're back.

26:53.518 --> 26:55.282
How was your trip?
Tell me everything.

26:55.365 --> 26:58.032
I mean, there's not that much to tell.
It was work, you know?

26:58.200 --> 27:01.343
Excuse me, you were on safari halfway
across the world a million miles away.

27:01.426 --> 27:03.696
There's nothing to tell?
How was the weather?

27:03.779 --> 27:07.882
- How were the people? The food?
- I'll tell you everything, but later.

27:08.283 --> 27:10.928
Would I be the worst sister in
the world if I told you I was exhausted

27:11.011 --> 27:12.916
and I just want Clay
to take me home?

27:12.999 --> 27:16.375
I know it's Thanksgiving. You did
an amazing job and cooked way too...

27:17.383 --> 27:18.986
- Thank you.
- Yes. Go. I get it.

27:19.069 --> 27:20.571
Be with Clay. And feed him.

27:20.654 --> 27:22.964
He's been sneaking
my mashed potatoes all day.

27:23.048 --> 27:25.000
You're the best worst sister ever.

27:25.222 --> 27:26.772
I'm thankful for you.

27:27.352 --> 27:29.740
Not just today, every day.

27:34.700 --> 27:37.292
- Does it hurt?
- Not as bad as when you hit me.

27:43.368 --> 27:44.368
Thanks.

27:48.041 --> 27:49.834
Don't even think about it.

27:54.095 --> 27:55.095
But...

27:58.886 --> 28:00.636
That table's for misfits.

28:01.085 --> 28:02.704
How perfect for you.

28:03.572 --> 28:04.572
Victoria.

28:05.659 --> 28:07.758
Over here.
I saved a seat for you.

28:09.959 --> 28:11.484
I don't like them being together.

28:11.567 --> 28:13.088
- It's your mom.
- I don't care.

28:14.889 --> 28:16.651
Doesn't she look like a turkey?

28:19.402 --> 28:20.573
Not really.

28:20.656 --> 28:22.756
She totally looks like a turkey.

28:22.839 --> 28:24.917
Okay, uh, we have tons of food,

28:25.000 --> 28:26.485
so please dig in.

28:26.778 --> 28:27.778
And...

28:28.438 --> 28:31.295
Also, we have
a tradition at our house

28:31.378 --> 28:34.587
of going around the table and
saying what we're thankful for.

28:34.829 --> 28:35.838
I'll start.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.517
I'm really grateful to be surrounded

28:39.600 --> 28:42.850
by such amazing friends
and family, and...

28:44.378 --> 28:46.778
I'm really glad
that you're all here.

28:48.963 --> 28:52.229
- I'm thankful we're hanging out again.
- I'm thankful that you said that.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.726
You guys need to do it.

28:53.809 --> 28:55.856
I'm surprised
you haven't slept with him.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.820
I'm thankful for my baby brother.

28:59.988 --> 29:01.738
- Or sister.
- Whatever.

29:03.116 --> 29:06.529
I'm also thankful that Aunt Quinn
is back and for Chester

29:06.755 --> 29:09.805
and I hope that Erin
gets to see her parents soon.

29:13.855 --> 29:14.855
I'm next.

29:15.105 --> 29:17.695
I am thankful that I'm hot
and that I'm famous.

29:18.786 --> 29:20.251
Well, I'm thankful...

29:20.334 --> 29:23.344
I'm thankful that I don't have
to be a whore to be confident.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.902
I'm thankful that girls call me
a whore, 'cause it actually means

29:25.985 --> 29:28.391
they're jealous that I'm prettier
and more interesting than them.

29:28.559 --> 29:29.773
Right, that's it.

29:29.856 --> 29:32.228
My mom says we have to switch seats.

29:32.811 --> 29:35.877
That is a great idea, Jamie.
Thank you.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.898
Gobble, gobble.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.520
Brooke, can you pass the wine,
please?

29:42.046 --> 29:45.010
I would, but it looks like
you and Sylvia drank it all.

29:45.541 --> 29:48.035
I'm thankful I have more wine
in the kitchen. I'll go get some.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.745
I'm thankful my wife needs help.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.242
Please come back.

29:52.483 --> 29:53.812
As I was saying,

29:54.410 --> 29:56.908
I'm thankful for my baby boy

29:57.556 --> 30:00.028
and that I could bring Brooke

30:00.466 --> 30:02.258
and Victoria together.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.396
You invited her?

30:04.821 --> 30:06.221
It's Thanksgiving.

30:06.854 --> 30:09.473
- Yeah. I'll take that.
- Okay, sure.

30:12.427 --> 30:15.604
Please, Brooke, can I have
a glass before you chug it all?

30:15.687 --> 30:18.939
No. I've decided to stop
giving things away.

30:21.730 --> 30:24.229
Well, that's probably wise
since you don't have anything left.

30:24.312 --> 30:26.302
I know what I'm not thankful for.

30:26.385 --> 30:28.784
Okay, I think what we mean to say

30:28.952 --> 30:31.231
is that we're so grateful
for what we have

30:31.314 --> 30:33.239
because we've been through
so much this year,

30:33.966 --> 30:37.486
so many things that were not easy
and things that make you realize

30:38.934 --> 30:40.921
you're all grown up and on your own.

30:42.799 --> 30:44.917
Hopefully we came out
the other side stronger

30:45.000 --> 30:46.667
and with the realization

30:46.752 --> 30:49.305
that we really do have a lot
to be grateful for.

30:51.308 --> 30:54.008
I just want to say that
I wish my mom was here, because...

30:54.634 --> 30:57.229
even it felt bad, I would have
the chance to make it better.

31:01.176 --> 31:03.665
And you two, fighting over a boy

31:03.748 --> 31:06.877
when you've got the whole world
at your fingertips. Are you crazy?

31:07.129 --> 31:09.742
What some of us wouldn't give
to be living our dream.

31:12.332 --> 31:14.870
So, maybe instead of focusing
on what we don't have,

31:14.953 --> 31:17.114
we can focus on what we do have.

31:23.954 --> 31:24.954
<i>Slainte.</i>

31:25.841 --> 31:27.691
That means "cheers", right?

31:28.087 --> 31:29.087
Cheers!

31:29.722 --> 31:31.172
Happy Thanksgiving.

31:31.880 --> 31:32.880
Cheers!

31:35.811 --> 31:37.011
Eat. Dig in.

31:47.502 --> 31:48.502
Thank you.

31:48.585 --> 31:51.396
Hey, Haley.
Thank you so much for today.

31:51.479 --> 31:56.096
The food was amazing, and the
company was... Almost amazing.

31:56.543 --> 31:59.759
Sure thing, Alex. You're welcome.
Feel free to any take leftovers.

32:00.424 --> 32:02.211
She already did that, hales.

32:03.883 --> 32:06.405
Do you mind if I take this pie
for Chase?

32:06.992 --> 32:08.942
No, actually, I mind.
I made it.

32:09.025 --> 32:10.950
Well, I don't care
'cause I'm gonna take it.

32:11.216 --> 32:12.982
- It's my pie.
- Doesn't matter. I want it.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.365
What's going on?

32:14.555 --> 32:16.976
- She's greedy with her stupid pie.
- She keeps taking my stuff.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.917
They're fighting over a pie?

32:19.143 --> 32:20.963
They're fighting over Chase.

32:21.747 --> 32:25.056
- Seriously?
- Yeah. The pie made more sense, right?

32:26.435 --> 32:27.935
I know who he likes.

32:34.432 --> 32:36.479
What are you waiting for?
Push "play".

32:36.758 --> 32:39.508
But if he picks you,
it'll totally wreck me.

32:40.354 --> 32:42.825
I actually agree with you
about something.

32:42.908 --> 32:43.908
Wait!

32:44.356 --> 32:46.247
Whoever he picks
gets to be with him.

32:46.610 --> 32:48.666
No more fighting.
No more games.

32:48.967 --> 32:49.967
Fine.

32:56.245 --> 32:58.125
<i>I guess if I had to choose,</i>

32:58.438 --> 33:00.511
<i>well, that's hard because
they're both great girls.</i>

33:00.742 --> 33:01.942
<i>Amazing girls.</i>

33:02.642 --> 33:05.114
<i>But the truth is...</i>

33:06.483 --> 33:08.283
<i>I think they chose for me.</i>

33:10.519 --> 33:13.940
<i>I want to be with a girl
who really wants to be with me,</i>

33:14.455 --> 33:17.755
<i>not someone who lies to me
or broke up with me by text.</i>

33:20.130 --> 33:22.374
<i>I think I should just be
by myself for a while.</i>

33:27.632 --> 33:28.868
Not what I expected.

33:29.426 --> 33:31.845
- Me either. I thought he'd pick you.
- Yeah, me too.

33:31.928 --> 33:34.396
Although I kind of panicked
and thought it might be you.

33:38.107 --> 33:40.007
That pie smells really good.

33:41.562 --> 33:44.313
It is really good.
And it's not store-bought, either.

33:53.658 --> 33:54.658
Nice job.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.991
We're heading out.
Thanks again for having us.

34:05.075 --> 34:06.859
I'm so glad you came.

34:09.168 --> 34:11.496
Hales, I'm really sorry
that your mom isn't here.

34:12.464 --> 34:15.335
She would be really proud of you.
You are so much like her.

34:15.594 --> 34:16.594
Thank you.

34:16.678 --> 34:19.572
Well, she's never very far.
She's in my heart.

34:21.062 --> 34:23.509
You must think I'm awful
for fighting with Victoria.

34:24.643 --> 34:28.166
I just... I wasn't prepared
to see her today, and...

34:29.021 --> 34:30.900
I'm not ready
to forgive her yet.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.920
I totally understand.

34:34.118 --> 34:36.826
But if you think you can fix it, do.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.938
Don't waste a lot of time, you know.

34:39.022 --> 34:40.369
You might not have it.

34:43.717 --> 34:45.983
I'm thankful
you're such a good friend.

34:46.202 --> 34:48.581
I'm thankful I got to watch you
chug wine out of a bottle.

34:51.203 --> 34:52.757
- Classy.
- Bye.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.458
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

34:54.909 --> 34:56.944
Don't forget your jello salad.

34:57.289 --> 34:59.173
Sylvia, it was a pleasure.
Thank you.

34:59.256 --> 35:01.135
It was a hoot, really.

35:11.689 --> 35:14.267
- Martini lunch next week.
- You got it.

35:15.971 --> 35:16.971
Thank you.

35:18.824 --> 35:19.824
Safe home.

35:24.227 --> 35:26.572
Well, that was lovely,
don't you think?

35:26.826 --> 35:28.190
Yep.
Lovely.

35:31.167 --> 35:34.465
She just got out of prison and I thought
that you would want to see her.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.883
No, not really.

35:36.582 --> 35:38.250
Not at all, actually.

35:38.898 --> 35:40.671
Well, I guess I was wrong.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.624
Sylvia, I know that you mean well.

35:45.709 --> 35:48.736
And I really appreciate it,
but you don't have to...

35:49.772 --> 35:51.498
Be so helpful all the time.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.476
I just want everybody to be happy.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.188
I know, and...

35:59.636 --> 36:02.135
if it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have Julian.

36:03.105 --> 36:05.746
So you already gave me
a lot of happy.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.341
The leftovers are the best part.

36:17.424 --> 36:18.548
Thanks, Haley.

36:19.027 --> 36:21.180
It means everything
that you included me.

36:21.687 --> 36:25.072
It's so nice to be surrounded by people
that care about each other so much.

36:25.155 --> 36:26.999
Yeah. I actually overheard
you telling Jamie

36:27.084 --> 36:28.949
that you don't talk
to your parents much.

36:30.145 --> 36:32.147
I don't talk to my parents at all.

36:32.830 --> 36:33.984
Can I ask why?

36:35.023 --> 36:36.963
They didn't believe in my music.

36:37.175 --> 36:40.857
They told me I was throwing my life
away, that I was wasting my time.

36:41.932 --> 36:45.202
I told them I couldn't respect a parent
that didn't believe in their child,

36:45.703 --> 36:47.788
who told them their dream
wasn't worthwhile.

36:49.214 --> 36:52.214
They said some things,
I said some things, and...

36:53.028 --> 36:54.294
We haven't spoke since.

36:56.487 --> 36:59.291
Well, we're just gonna have to
prove them wrong, aren't we?

37:00.606 --> 37:01.606
Come on.

37:04.803 --> 37:06.372
It was a nice day.

37:06.976 --> 37:08.633
It was a very nice day.

37:09.580 --> 37:11.786
I'm glad we got to
spend it together.

37:12.145 --> 37:13.145
Me too.

37:17.994 --> 37:19.486
You can kiss me now.

38:02.681 --> 38:03.681
Hey, you.

38:06.003 --> 38:08.685
I just got you back.
Where you going?

38:09.379 --> 38:11.855
I'm gonna develop some photos
from my trip.

38:12.116 --> 38:14.468
- I'm really excited.
- Come here.

38:29.227 --> 38:30.807
I'm happy you're happy.

38:42.412 --> 38:44.485
I destroyed that turkey.

38:45.495 --> 38:47.690
It might've been okay
if my mom didn't spray it.

38:50.376 --> 38:51.376
No.

38:53.911 --> 38:56.411
You know,
everything that's happened...

38:57.327 --> 38:59.077
Maybe it's okay in a way.

39:00.846 --> 39:02.766
I learned the important people,

39:03.205 --> 39:05.805
the important things,
they don't go away.

39:06.972 --> 39:09.776
- You're still here.
- And I'm never gonna leave.

39:18.454 --> 39:20.741
Mom, I have the wishbone.
Make a wish.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.418
You ready?

39:22.501 --> 39:24.879
One, two, three.

39:29.310 --> 39:31.224
Both our wishes are gonna come true.

39:32.499 --> 39:33.499
Awesome.

39:38.932 --> 39:40.711
Listen to me.
About school...

39:42.571 --> 39:45.348
You have more determination
than anyone I know.

39:46.265 --> 39:48.834
And I really, really
believe in you, Nathan.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.638
Well, that means everything.

39:53.911 --> 39:55.638
You want to know what I wished for?

39:58.788 --> 40:01.632
I wished that you
would believe in yourself

40:02.217 --> 40:03.766
as much as I believe in you.
