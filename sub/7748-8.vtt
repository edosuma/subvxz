Oh, I kind of prefer the Bach.

24:52.447 --> 24:53.318
Yeah?

24:53.959 --> 24:55.063
I find it too salty.

24:55.084 --> 24:57.851
Well, the Bach has the bacon which I like,

24:57.877 --> 25:01.394
but, of course, you can get
the Mozart with the bacon.

25:01.899 --> 25:03.822
That's a Salieri.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.787
- I have to thank you.
- Well,

25:08.089 --> 25:09.735
shall we shake hands on it?

25:09.975 --> 25:12.143
Are you... are you sure?

25:12.367 --> 25:15.124
'Cause I heard that you don't
like doing that kind of thing.

25:15.181 --> 25:19.298
Oh, please. I don't know
how these rumors get started.

25:22.852 --> 25:26.406
We are gonna play together one day.
