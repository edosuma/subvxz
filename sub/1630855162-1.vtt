01:29.041 --> 01:31.041
[chattering on radio]

01:41.125 --> 01:44.208
[alarm blares]

01:44.291 --> 01:47.333
[announcer on PA] Attention,
all dome personnel and residents.

01:47.416 --> 01:52.208
Due to the meteor shower warning,
the lockdown will start in seven minutes.

01:52.291 --> 01:56.125
Please return to your living quarters
and remain there until further notice.

01:56.791 --> 02:00.791
I repeat,
the lockdown will start in seven minutes.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.333
[teen 1] How much longer?
The lockdown's about to start.

02:06.416 --> 02:08.791
[teen 2] Oh, thanks. We didn't hear
the super loud announcement.

02:08.875 --> 02:10.250
[teen 3] Is that supposed to be blinking?

02:10.333 --> 02:11.916
[teen 1] You guys are bad at being bad.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.083
-[teen 2] Hey, you could help, you know?
-[teen 1] I got us in here. Doing my part.

02:15.166 --> 02:16.708
[teen 2]
Could you at least hand me that wrench?

02:16.791 --> 02:19.333
Seriously, guys. Why is this blinking?

02:20.291 --> 02:21.791
Probably because we're stealing it.

02:21.875 --> 02:25.041
Why don't you say that a little louder in
case the microphones didn't pick that up?

02:25.125 --> 02:28.000
Don't worry, genius.
They don't have microphones down here.

02:28.083 --> 02:30.125
Seriously, you don't have to wear that.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.708
Says you.
They probably have facial ID scans.

02:32.791 --> 02:34.875
Borney, it's a garage, not a food vault.

02:34.958 --> 02:36.708
[teen 2] And you look like an idiot.

02:36.791 --> 02:38.750
Yeah, well, my brother told me once,

02:38.833 --> 02:40.625
this kid, he got caught
messing around down here,

02:40.708 --> 02:43.875
and then they put him in a holding cell
out by the terra complex

02:43.958 --> 02:45.750
and left him there for 60 years.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.541
-You're doing it again.
-Doing what?

02:47.625 --> 02:48.625
You're catastrophizing.

02:48.708 --> 02:50.791
-Okay, that's not even a word.
-Of course it's a word.

02:50.875 --> 02:53.166
-[teen 1] It's totally a word.
-[door opens]

02:53.250 --> 02:54.250
What was that?

02:54.333 --> 02:55.291
[door closes]

02:55.375 --> 02:56.458
Everybody, hide.

02:56.541 --> 02:57.625
[whispers] Go, quick, quick.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.291
[grunts, sighs]

03:02.375 --> 03:04.125
[worker 1] Where is everybody?

03:04.208 --> 03:07.625
[worker 2] They're in lockdown like
we were supposed to be 30 minutes ago.

03:07.708 --> 03:08.791
[worker 1] Okay, okay.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.000
[door closes]

03:18.083 --> 03:19.083
We're clear.

03:21.791 --> 03:23.416
Don't tell me I'm catastrophizing.

03:23.500 --> 03:26.375
Dylan, it's almost lockdown.
What is taking so long?

03:26.458 --> 03:27.958
[Borney] Catastrophizing. [scoffs]

03:28.541 --> 03:31.833
[Dylan grunts] What's your personal record
for hot-wiring a rover, huh?

03:31.916 --> 03:33.791
[grunting]

03:33.875 --> 03:34.708
[engine whirs]

03:34.791 --> 03:36.208
-[Dylan laughs]
-Whoa!

03:36.291 --> 03:37.416
[Dylan] Yes!

03:37.500 --> 03:39.000
How'd you like that, huh?

03:39.083 --> 03:43.083
[alarm blaring]

03:43.166 --> 03:45.166
-You said there wouldn't be alarms.
-Yeah, on the doors.

03:45.250 --> 03:47.250
-What do you mean--
-I told you, but nobody listens to me!

03:47.333 --> 03:49.291
We're gonna spend
the rest of our lives in a tiny cell!

03:49.375 --> 03:50.416
Do something! Turn it off.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.791
Oh, yeah. Let me get right on that
for you. I don't know how!

03:52.875 --> 03:55.333
-What do you mean you don't know how?
-[teen 1] You're the one who did it!

03:55.416 --> 03:57.666
[Dylan] Your dad's on the science team.
Just do something!

04:06.041 --> 04:07.041
[door opens]

04:07.125 --> 04:10.041
You must be Caleb.
My name is Maria Slater.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.875
Sorry to keep you waiting.

04:13.875 --> 04:18.666
We've only got a few more hours until
the lockdown, so things are a bit chaotic.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.833
Would you like some chocolate?

04:25.875 --> 04:30.000
It's real. Just arrived
on the cargo shuttle this morning.

04:32.041 --> 04:37.958
Caleb, are you aware of the death benefits
included in your father's contract?

04:38.500 --> 04:39.958
Yes, ma'am.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.500
It said if he died working in the mines,

04:42.583 --> 04:47.916
then any family he had here with him
would get to go to Omega.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.375
That's right.

04:49.458 --> 04:51.500
It's important that you understand

04:52.208 --> 04:55.250
how much we all appreciate
your father's service.

04:56.041 --> 04:58.916
I can only imagine
how devastating this must be.

05:00.750 --> 05:04.000
I understand that you also
lost your mother a few years back.

05:04.083 --> 05:05.083
Seven.

05:05.958 --> 05:07.416
She died seven years ago.

05:12.208 --> 05:17.583
The journey to Omega,
as you probably are aware, is 75 years.

05:17.666 --> 05:21.625
You, of course, will be in cryosleep
for the duration of the trip.

05:21.708 --> 05:26.375
Once you arrive, it'll be like waking
from a long, peaceful nap,

05:26.458 --> 05:28.625
exactly the same age you are now.

05:28.708 --> 05:31.750
Do I have to go? Can't I just stay here?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.708
I'm afraid that is not an option.

05:35.791 --> 05:37.958
I understand that you probably
will miss your friends.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.916
I'll never see them again.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.791
By the time I wake up,
they'll be old or dead.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.416
You will make new friends on Omega.

05:46.250 --> 05:50.250
Caleb, your parents sacrificed
a great deal to give you this opportunity.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.333
People who come here
and work in the mines,

05:52.416 --> 05:55.583
they spend years
fueling the transports to Omega,

05:55.666 --> 06:00.166
all so that their families,
their children, can be on them.

06:01.833 --> 06:05.583
Now, the meteor shower warning
will be in effect for the next 72 hours.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.500
Once the lockdown is lifted,
and we have the all-clear,

06:08.583 --> 06:11.541
you will be on a transport
and on your way.

06:12.333 --> 06:15.333
I thought the next transport didn't leave
for another two months.

06:15.916 --> 06:18.333
Scheduling is always a bit fluid.

06:20.166 --> 06:23.166
I know it may not seem like it right now,

06:23.250 --> 06:28.291
but this really is the start
of something special for you.

06:30.333 --> 06:33.166
[workers chattering]

06:52.833 --> 06:55.166
[grunts, pants]

06:57.791 --> 07:00.333
[Michael] Come on, Caleb. You can do it.

07:02.125 --> 07:03.166
Don't be scared.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.375
What if I fall?

07:07.208 --> 07:08.208
Geez.

07:10.708 --> 07:12.291
That'd be pretty messy, wouldn't it?

07:12.375 --> 07:14.083
We can go back down if you want.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.500
We don't have to do this.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.958
But if we do, you gotta get up there
on your own.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.125
-You understand why?
-Yeah.

07:23.875 --> 07:25.250
You wanna go down?

07:27.291 --> 07:30.291
-[sighs] No.
-Good man.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.625
Go on then. Let's do this.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.875
[Michael]
You see that little star right there?

07:54.041 --> 07:55.583
Just off the edge of that cluster.

07:56.833 --> 07:58.416
-You see it?
-Yeah.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.958
[Michael] They say it burned out
over a hundred years ago.

08:01.041 --> 08:04.250
But it was so far away, the last
of its light hasn't reached us yet.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.958
Your mom used to say
it's like a memory traveling through time.

08:09.125 --> 08:12.666
We'd sit up here, and she'd say
life was just like that star.

08:14.375 --> 08:19.291
And all the memories we have, all
the people we love, the places we've been,

08:19.791 --> 08:22.708
that's the light we see,
even though the star is gone.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
You were born here, raised here.

08:32.375 --> 08:34.625
This dome is the only world
you've ever known.

08:37.416 --> 08:39.666
So many memories you never got to have.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.291
We're gonna fix that someday.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
How?

08:45.083 --> 08:49.166
Well, there's a place me and your mom
used to sneak away back to

08:49.250 --> 08:51.833
before you were born,
just off past the eastern ridge.

08:53.791 --> 08:55.875
It's the only place up here
she really loved.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.541
Right there.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.458
What's so special about it?

09:04.541 --> 09:08.083
You'll see. When you're a little older,
you and me are gonna take a road trip.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.500
A what?

09:09.583 --> 09:11.625
[chuckles]
Something we used to do back on Earth.

09:11.708 --> 09:14.041
No better way to travel
when you gotta get somewhere.

09:23.291 --> 09:25.375
-Hey.
-[Caleb] Hey.

09:25.458 --> 09:27.208
Figured I might find you up here.

09:30.666 --> 09:32.458
How'd things go with Ms. Slater?

09:33.708 --> 09:35.958
They're putting me on a transport
in three days.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.750
As soon as the lockdown's over.

09:41.708 --> 09:42.875
We could still do it.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.166
No, it's fine. We don't have to--

09:45.250 --> 09:49.250
Hey. Whatever's out there,
your dad wanted you to see it.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.583
We're doing this.

09:53.833 --> 09:56.666
-Just thought we'd have more time.
-Me too.

09:57.875 --> 10:00.541
[Borney panting]

10:00.625 --> 10:03.916
Marcus, this is too high.
Why do they always have to go up so high?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.916
-[Marcus] You're almost there.
-Here he is.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.333
Hey, did you get your pills?

10:07.416 --> 10:09.916
[Marcus] Yeah, I got my pills.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.875
Why are you always bothering me
about my pills?

10:12.958 --> 10:15.791
Because you've got a heart
the size of an asteroid, that's why.

10:15.875 --> 10:19.125
[Marcus] Yeah? Well, you've got the mouth
the size of a black hole. [chuckles]

10:19.208 --> 10:20.208
[Borney] Good one.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.250
-Hey, guys.
-[Dylan] Hey.

10:23.083 --> 10:26.583
[groans] Hey, how about from now on,
we do this a little lower to the ground?

10:26.666 --> 10:28.166
-[Marcus] Hey.
-That sounds pretty good to me.

10:28.250 --> 10:31.833
-[Marcus] How'd things go with Ms. Slayer?
-[Borney] That lady scares me.

10:31.916 --> 10:33.333
[Marcus] Yeah, that lady scares everybody.

10:33.416 --> 10:35.416
[Borney] My brother told me
this kid talked back to her,

10:35.500 --> 10:37.875
and then he disappeared for two days.

10:37.958 --> 10:39.416
A-And when they found him again,

10:39.500 --> 10:41.750
he said he couldn't remember
a single thing that happened.

10:41.833 --> 10:42.791
[chuckles]

10:42.875 --> 10:44.958
You realize not a thing
you just said is true, right?

10:45.041 --> 10:46.166
Yeah, well, what do you know?

10:46.250 --> 10:48.625
My brother's a genius.
He knows these things.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.583
Seriously, what was she like?

10:51.666 --> 10:52.833
She gave me chocolate.

10:52.916 --> 10:54.583
Like, actual, real chocolate?

10:55.250 --> 10:57.250
Man, real chocolate.

10:57.916 --> 11:00.416
I can't even remember
the last time I had chocolate.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.166
W-Wait a second. What's going on?

11:05.250 --> 11:06.666
What's wrong with you guys?

11:08.041 --> 11:09.458
He's leaving in three days.

11:09.541 --> 11:10.750
What?

11:10.833 --> 11:13.750
But-- But the next transport
didn't leave for another two months.

11:13.833 --> 11:16.000
They're sending one
as soon as the lockdown's over.

11:19.416 --> 11:23.375
So, we're still leaving, though, right?

11:23.458 --> 11:24.625
Are you kidding me?

11:26.041 --> 11:27.125
We're leaving tonight.

11:28.541 --> 11:30.250
[Borney] Are you guys sure we're ready?

11:30.750 --> 11:33.250
[sighs] With what we added today,
I think we have enough.

11:33.750 --> 11:37.208
Hey, can you imagine what they'll do to us
if they find out we stole this much stuff?

11:37.291 --> 11:39.666
-I can.
-We're gonna need more oxygen.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.708
They're definitely gonna notice
if we take more.

11:41.791 --> 11:44.291
Yeah, but they won't notice
before tonight.

11:44.958 --> 11:48.125
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You guys, I got a crack-smacker.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.541
-A what?
-You know, for cracks.

11:50.625 --> 11:53.708
-Do you mean a sealant pen?
-Yeah, if you wanna be all technical.

11:53.791 --> 11:55.166
[knocking]

11:56.125 --> 11:58.000
Hey, quick. Quick, cover this up.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.750
-Wait, wait, wait.
-[Borney] Marcus, hey, help me hide this.

12:04.875 --> 12:06.083
[keypad beeps]

12:08.333 --> 12:09.541
Caleb Channing?

12:10.875 --> 12:12.250
Yes, sir.

12:14.416 --> 12:15.833
[messenger] Your father's ashes.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.458
Sorry for your loss.

12:31.416 --> 12:32.833
That was depressing.

12:35.791 --> 12:38.791
[laughing]

12:41.833 --> 12:43.541
-[Dylan] You okay?
-[Caleb] Yeah.

12:43.625 --> 12:44.708
[Dylan] You sure?

12:45.708 --> 12:46.916
You're all right, buddy.

12:49.416 --> 12:53.041
I'm just saying, the whole point
of a lockdown is so you don't leave.

12:53.125 --> 12:54.625
Yeah, that's why tonight's perfect.

12:54.708 --> 12:57.125
Once we get clear of the perimeter,
they can't come after us.

12:57.208 --> 13:00.083
-It's like an insurance thing.
-But there's a meteor shower warning.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.666
Yeah. They issue those warnings
all the time.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.750
Have you ever actually seen
a meteor shower?

13:04.833 --> 13:07.000
That's a dumb question. How could I?

13:07.083 --> 13:08.583
We've never even been outside before.

13:08.666 --> 13:10.333
You don't have to come
if you don't want to.

13:10.416 --> 13:11.708
Of course I'm coming.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.875
What about you? You sure you can do this?

13:16.750 --> 13:17.833
He's gotta bring his pills.

13:17.916 --> 13:19.666
Dude,
will you knock it off with the pills?

13:19.750 --> 13:21.458
Stop worrying.
It's not good for you. Thank you.

13:21.541 --> 13:23.208
If I don't worry, who's gonna worry?

13:26.708 --> 13:28.416
I wanna go outside.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.041
That settles it then.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.125
Hey.

13:34.666 --> 13:37.250
We don't have the access codes
into the garage.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.458
How are we gonna get out?

13:40.375 --> 13:42.541
I got an idea about that. [chuckles]

13:44.916 --> 13:47.541
[Borney] Addison Weaver. That's your idea?

13:47.625 --> 13:50.500
Don't stare.
Yes, that's my idea. It's perfect.

13:50.583 --> 13:53.250
She just came up from Earth,
like, a couple of months ago.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.875
Doesn't have any friends.

13:54.958 --> 13:56.291
[whispers] I hear she's weird.

13:56.791 --> 13:58.500
[Dylan sighs] Well, I can handle that.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.583
Plus, her dad's on the science team.

14:00.666 --> 14:03.958
So she has all codes
to all subbasement garages.

14:04.041 --> 14:07.541
I don't know, man. Like you said,
she doesn't have any friends.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.541
So we're just gonna be all nice
to get the codes?

14:10.500 --> 14:11.500
[Dylan] All right, look.

14:11.583 --> 14:14.750
We can all do something really nice
for her when we get back, okay?

14:14.833 --> 14:17.541
Right now, this is the only way
we get to do this.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.250
[Borney sighs]

14:19.333 --> 14:20.333
All right.

14:28.750 --> 14:29.750
[Dylan clears throat]

14:31.625 --> 14:32.625
[sighs]

14:34.791 --> 14:35.791
Hi.

14:38.958 --> 14:39.958
Can I help you?

14:40.041 --> 14:41.458
My name's Dylan.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.875
-Cool name.
-[chuckles] Thanks.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.708
You know, I saw you sitting over here,
and I thought you--

14:51.833 --> 14:54.416
Hey-- Hey, wait! Hold on.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.416
-Hey, come on. [grunts]
-Hey, watch it.

14:57.958 --> 14:58.958
[Dylan] Addison, wait.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.458
[sighs]
I don't think it's going very well.

15:02.583 --> 15:04.000
[Dylan] Just hold on. Wait.

15:05.541 --> 15:06.833
-Hey, hey, hey. Hey.
-What?

15:06.916 --> 15:09.083
-Just--
-I know the way you guys think about me.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.041
I'm just
a spoiled little Earth girl, right?

15:11.916 --> 15:14.708
The only time that anyone here talks to me
is whenever they want something.

15:14.791 --> 15:16.041
So whatever it is, the answer's no.

15:16.125 --> 15:19.375
Okay. First of all, you don't know
why I came over here.

15:19.458 --> 15:22.208
Maybe I came over here
because I feel bad no one talks to you.

15:23.208 --> 15:24.458
Okay, great. Are we done?

15:25.083 --> 15:26.708
Okay, okay. Just hold on.

15:26.791 --> 15:28.500
Hey, can you hear me out?

15:28.583 --> 15:29.583
-Please?
-What?

15:30.708 --> 15:35.291
Look, my best friend is about to leave.
Like forever. Okay?

15:36.416 --> 15:38.833
His dad was the miner
that got killed last week.

15:40.916 --> 15:42.208
I'm sorry. I didn't--

15:43.416 --> 15:44.625
I didn't know.

15:44.708 --> 15:45.791
[chattering]

15:45.875 --> 15:48.791
Bet she tells Ms. Slayer on us.
Then we're really in for it.

15:48.875 --> 15:50.708
You need to be more positive, man.

15:50.791 --> 15:53.708
Oh, I'm plenty positive.
Positive she's gonna tell on us.

15:53.791 --> 15:55.750
Are you trying to freak everyone out?

15:55.833 --> 15:57.208
[Borney] But why would she help us?

15:57.291 --> 15:58.291
[sighs]

15:58.958 --> 16:00.625
So what do you need the codes for?

16:02.166 --> 16:07.125
Uh, we need to borrow
one of the long-range rovers.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.291
Why?

16:09.375 --> 16:10.708
'Cause we gotta go somewhere.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.791
-Where do you have to go?
-That's not important.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.500
Well, it is if you want the codes.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Okay.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.708
There's a crater
about a day's ride from here.

16:21.791 --> 16:23.000
It's in the eighth quadrant.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.666
Nobody's supposed to go out there.
Not even the miners go out there.

16:25.750 --> 16:29.375
Look, all we need from you are the codes
to get the rover and to get outside.

16:29.458 --> 16:32.125
I still don't get exactly
why you're doing this.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.333
I told you already, okay?
His dad wanted him to--

16:34.416 --> 16:36.333
Yeah, yeah. No, I get why he's doing it.

16:36.916 --> 16:37.916
Why are you?

16:39.125 --> 16:40.208
'Cause he's my friend.

16:50.708 --> 16:53.125
Yeah. Okay, fine.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.916
-Yeah, I'll get you the codes.
-Really?

16:57.000 --> 17:00.416
-Under one condition.
-Yeah, yeah. Anything.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.625
-She what?
-She wants to come, okay?

17:02.708 --> 17:03.708
Why?

17:03.791 --> 17:06.833
I don't know. She said it's the only way
she'll give us the codes.

17:07.541 --> 17:10.083
This is a bad idea. No.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.958
-No, this is, like, the worst idea ever.
-Why?

17:13.041 --> 17:15.291
-[whispers] Because she's from Earth.
-[Dylan] So?

17:15.375 --> 17:18.875
Earth people have different ways.
They're-- They're peculiar.

17:18.958 --> 17:20.500
You're peculiar.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.000
Let's give her a shot, man.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.875
But she doesn't know how we do stuff.

17:23.958 --> 17:28.708
Okay, look. She's not gonna give us
the codes unless we let her come, right?

17:28.791 --> 17:29.791
Pretty much.

17:30.333 --> 17:33.958
-Then we vote. All in favor?
-Yeah.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.416
-It's gotta be unanimous, Borney.
-Borney, put your stupid hand in.

17:38.500 --> 17:39.916
[groans]

17:40.958 --> 17:43.125
-Thank you. Now let me win this one.
-[Borney] Hey, not fair.

17:43.208 --> 17:44.666
-[Caleb] Nope. Nope. Uh-huh.
-Come on, guys!

17:44.750 --> 17:46.291
-Nope.
-[Marcus] You're gonna knock my drink.

17:46.375 --> 17:47.416
-What are you doing?
-You guys done?

17:47.500 --> 17:48.500
Oh.

17:50.333 --> 17:51.958
So, what's it gonna be?

17:57.125 --> 17:58.541
Let's go steal a rover.

17:59.958 --> 18:02.375
[Addison] Let me get right on that!
I don't know how to turn it off!

18:02.458 --> 18:05.500
[Borney] See, I told you! What did I say?
I said this was a bad idea!

18:05.583 --> 18:08.208
[Dylan] Borney, you're not helping!
So why don't you just--

18:09.375 --> 18:10.833
Yeah! Yeah, that'll work.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.083
[alarm blares]

18:16.166 --> 18:20.458
[announcer on PA] Attention. Attention,
all dome personnel and residents.

18:20.541 --> 18:21.541
[panting]

18:21.625 --> 18:27.791
Mandatory lockdown of all dome facilities
will commence in T-minus three minutes.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.166
We should go.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.458
Yeah, you think?

18:41.375 --> 18:42.458
[Caleb] Oxygen looks good.

18:42.541 --> 18:44.458
-[Marcus] Okay. This-- This is good.
-All right.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.750
-[Borney] Marcus?
-[Marcus] I got it.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.333
Are you sure you know
how to drive this thing?

18:52.416 --> 18:54.500
You kidding?
These things basically drive themselves.

18:55.875 --> 18:58.125
[engine cranks, sputters]

18:58.208 --> 18:59.375
I got it. I got it.

18:59.458 --> 19:00.916
[engine starts]

19:22.125 --> 19:23.583
Go punch in the code to the door.

19:23.666 --> 19:26.416
So you guys can drive off without me?
No, thanks.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.416
I got it. What's the code?

19:29.125 --> 19:30.916
Ten, 28, 58.

19:32.041 --> 19:34.250
Ten, 28, 58. Got it.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.041
[door hisses]

19:43.125 --> 19:44.166
[Dylan] Hey, what's that?

19:44.250 --> 19:47.416
[Addison] Just a little something
from Earth. It's a tradition.

19:48.708 --> 19:50.458
You said it was a road trip. Right?

19:52.833 --> 19:54.416
-Okay.
-[Marcus scoffs] Earth people.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.708
[announcer on PA]
Attention, all personnel.

19:58.791 --> 20:02.875
Mandatory lockdown
will commence in T-minus one minute.

20:06.416 --> 20:08.333
You know the best thing about road trips?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.541
You get to leave everything behind.

20:16.541 --> 20:17.875
[alarm blaring]

20:22.916 --> 20:25.250
[Michael]
No matter what's happened before.

20:25.333 --> 20:27.375
Whatever mistakes you might have made.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.375
Whatever dreams you might've lost.

20:31.416 --> 20:32.708
Whoever you're supposed to be

20:32.791 --> 20:34.708
or whatever the world
has tried to make you.

20:39.250 --> 20:40.500
Let's go. [sighs]

20:42.041 --> 20:45.250
[Michael] Because now you're deciding.
You're the one choosing the path.

20:52.875 --> 20:57.875
And the most important thing to remember,
it's not just about where you're going.

20:57.958 --> 21:01.541
It's about how you get there,
the people you get there with.

21:02.958 --> 21:06.166
You're never quite the same when
you finish as you were when you began.

21:16.416 --> 21:20.625
In that magical space between where
you've been and where you're going…

21:26.500 --> 21:27.500
you're free.

21:29.416 --> 21:31.291
You're the master of your own fate.

21:38.083 --> 21:41.291
[Caleb] We did it. We're actually outside.

21:41.791 --> 21:43.625
[Borney] Whoa. Look at that.

21:44.208 --> 21:46.166
It just goes on and on forever.

21:46.791 --> 21:48.583
-You okay, man?
-Yeah.

21:48.666 --> 21:50.833
[Borney] Oh, man.
This is gonna be so cool.

21:50.916 --> 21:53.833
We're like-- like adventurers now, like--
Uh, what's the word?

21:53.916 --> 21:55.583
Masters of our own fate.

21:56.708 --> 21:58.875
[Borney chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, I like that.

21:59.458 --> 22:00.666
Masters of our own fate.

22:05.291 --> 22:08.125
-You guys ready to see the moon?
-[Caleb] Yeah.

22:08.208 --> 22:09.833
-Whoo!
-[laughing]

22:10.458 --> 22:11.708
-Whoo!
-Let's do this!

22:12.208 --> 22:14.541
We're gonna visit all these places.
We're all gonna hang out.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.083
Gonna be so-- Gonna be so fun.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.333
-[Marcus] Let me grab the wheel.
-[Borney] Gonna be so fun.

22:19.291 --> 22:20.458
[Dylan] Let's do this!

22:49.750 --> 22:52.625
-What does this one do?
-[chuckling] No, no, no. Not those.

22:53.208 --> 22:55.583
[Marcus] Is this one… This one stops the--

22:58.666 --> 23:01.833
We are on track.
We've been driving for, like, two hours.

23:01.916 --> 23:05.791
So we have about ten more hours to go.

23:05.875 --> 23:08.125
[imitates gunshots]

23:08.208 --> 23:09.416
[both scream]

23:09.500 --> 23:11.875
-Hey! Not funny!
-[Marcus chuckling]

23:11.958 --> 23:14.875
-[Marcus] Get off of me! Get off of me!
-Hat. Give me the hat!

23:14.958 --> 23:17.541
-Stop!
-[laughs]

23:17.625 --> 23:20.416
-[Borney] Hey!
-[Marcus laughs] Look at you. Look at you.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.291
-[Marcus] Oh, my God.
-[Borney] This looks better.

23:22.375 --> 23:24.250
[Marcus]
Addison, does it look better? Seriously.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.541
[Dylan] Is that the transport?

23:28.625 --> 23:29.625
Yeah.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.125
[alarm beeping]

23:40.208 --> 23:41.375
[Borney] Time for your pills.

23:41.458 --> 23:42.458
[beeping stops]

23:46.041 --> 23:49.125
-What are those for?
-He's got a giant heart. Like huge.

23:49.208 --> 23:51.166
The doctors think he'll probably die
in a few years.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.166
-Dude.
-What? They do.

23:53.250 --> 23:55.791
But he won't because he takes his pills.
So, he's fine.

23:57.041 --> 23:58.958
-Well, that's good then.
-[Borney] Hey. [sighs]

23:59.041 --> 24:01.083
Will you hold on a second?
You gotta drink water.

24:01.166 --> 24:03.250
-Otherwise, you'll cough the whole time.
-[slurps]

24:06.250 --> 24:07.291
Hey.

24:07.375 --> 24:10.333
Hey, guys-- Guys, guys, check that out.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
[Borney chuckles]

24:12.666 --> 24:13.916
[Dylan chuckles]

24:14.416 --> 24:16.583
I've never seen anything like that before.

24:16.666 --> 24:19.166
-[Addison] Whoa.
-[Borney chuckles] Whoa.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.083
[Addison chuckles]

24:21.166 --> 24:22.833
I wonder what it was supposed to be?

24:27.708 --> 24:29.875
My dad used to talk
about places like that.

24:30.958 --> 24:34.375
He said back a long time ago
when they first came up from Earth

24:34.458 --> 24:35.833
and started building here,

24:35.916 --> 24:38.458
the moon was gonna be this big deal.

24:38.541 --> 24:40.125
Like a paradise.

24:40.208 --> 24:43.250
The kinda place people on Earth
only dreamed about.

24:43.333 --> 24:46.500
But once they found Omega,
everything just stopped.

24:46.583 --> 24:49.375
Now there's all this stuff out here
that never got finished.

25:03.291 --> 25:05.458
Can you imagine
if they'd finished building it?

25:05.541 --> 25:06.416
[Addison] Yeah.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.750
That'd be really cool.

25:15.083 --> 25:17.000
[Borney]
Are the buildings on Earth that big?

25:18.125 --> 25:20.458
[Addison] Yeah, most of them are bigger.

25:20.541 --> 25:22.625
Wow. Hey, what else is different?

25:22.708 --> 25:25.083
-Between the Earth and the moon?
-Yeah.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.708
Let's see. There's, uh--

25:27.541 --> 25:31.208
There's trees that have leaves
that change color in the fall.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.458
Uh…

25:33.541 --> 25:35.791
Water. You don't have television.

25:35.875 --> 25:37.625
Haven't seen a book since I landed.

25:37.708 --> 25:41.833
You don't really have music,
rain, snow, wind, weather.

25:41.916 --> 25:44.208
I mean, don't they teach you guys
this stuff in school?

25:44.291 --> 25:46.250
[Dylan, Caleb chuckling]

25:46.333 --> 25:50.125
Mmm, no. No, see, school is
where they teach us how to mine helium,

25:50.208 --> 25:51.875
how to deal with low gravity in the mines,

25:51.958 --> 25:55.125
uh, mining helium, and how to handle
helium once it's been mined.

25:55.208 --> 25:57.375
All so a bunch of rich people
can have enough fuel

25:57.458 --> 25:58.833
for their transports to get to Omega.

25:58.916 --> 26:01.208
I mean, it's a really great program. Yeah.

26:02.666 --> 26:05.375
Well, if that's true,
then how do you know so much about Earth?

26:07.208 --> 26:09.000
Because my dad grew up there.

26:09.083 --> 26:11.625
So? Didn't all of your parents
grow up on Earth?

26:11.708 --> 26:13.875
[Dylan] Not mine.
My grandparents did though.

26:13.958 --> 26:16.541
-Uh, Borney over there, his--
-Great-grandparents.

26:16.625 --> 26:18.375
Yeah. Right. Marcus…

26:19.416 --> 26:21.583
Marcus, how long's your family
been on the rock?

26:22.625 --> 26:23.708
A long time.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.416
Well, that doesn't even make any sense.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.125
It's a 20-year contract.

26:28.208 --> 26:31.208
You work in the mines for 20 years,
then you get to take your family to Omega.

26:31.291 --> 26:32.625
[Caleb] That's what they tell you.

26:32.708 --> 26:34.958
What they don't tell you is
every time you're late for a shift…

26:35.041 --> 26:36.041
Or you get a cold…

26:36.125 --> 26:38.208
Or delay production in any way…

26:38.291 --> 26:40.333
[Caleb] They add more and more time
to your contract.

26:40.416 --> 26:44.208
When my old man started in the mines,
he had six years to work off from his dad

26:44.291 --> 26:46.041
before he could even start his own 20.

26:47.333 --> 26:49.166
The whole thing's a giant scam.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.291
I'm sorry. I didn't--

26:55.166 --> 26:56.416
I didn't realize.

27:03.666 --> 27:05.250
Is the sky really blue?

27:07.500 --> 27:08.750
What?

27:09.750 --> 27:14.166
The sky, um, on Earth,
uh, is it really blue?

27:17.375 --> 27:18.375
Yeah.

27:19.250 --> 27:23.416
During the daytime. Blue as can be.

27:26.291 --> 27:28.041
-[Marcus sighs]
-[Borney chuckles]

27:28.125 --> 27:29.250
Wow.

27:35.875 --> 27:38.375
Caleb, what's in the crater?

27:42.208 --> 27:43.458
I don't know.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.750
Whenever my dad talked about it,

27:50.958 --> 27:56.208
all he really said was how important
it was to my mom that I see it.

27:59.541 --> 28:04.458
There was one time he said something
about a brook that splits in two.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.291
A brook? Inside the crater?

28:08.833 --> 28:10.500
[Caleb] He was probably just confused.

28:10.583 --> 28:13.458
-I-I bet there's treasure there.
-You think there's treasure everywhere.

28:13.541 --> 28:16.958
But there is! My brother told me
that the first settlers who came here

28:17.041 --> 28:18.541
brought all sorts of treasure with them.

28:18.625 --> 28:21.166
Then, they hid it in all these places
in the middle of nowhere.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.375
If there was any treasure,
they would have packed it up

28:23.458 --> 28:25.041
and put it on a ship to Omega years ago.

28:25.125 --> 28:28.250
You don't know. When I find treasure,
I'm not letting you have any of it.

28:28.333 --> 28:30.041
And you're gonna get all sad and say,

28:30.125 --> 28:32.875
"Aw, geez, Borney.
Can I please have some treasure?"

28:32.958 --> 28:34.625
And I'm just gonna say, "Sorry, Dylan.

28:34.708 --> 28:37.208
You're just gonna have to put more faith
in me next time,

28:37.291 --> 28:40.625
and then maybe, maybe,
I'll give you some of my next treasure."

28:41.375 --> 28:44.583
If you say treasure one more time,
you're going out the rover without a suit.

28:45.333 --> 28:46.750
T-rea-sure.

28:46.833 --> 28:48.416
-That's it. You're going outside.
-[Caleb] Whoa.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.208
-Hey, hey, hey.
-[Borney chuckles]

28:50.291 --> 28:51.791
[Caleb] Speaking of going outside,

28:53.041 --> 28:54.750
you guys ready to have some real fun?

28:59.750 --> 29:01.750
[air hissing]

29:03.250 --> 29:04.500
[Marcus] Thanks.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.291
-Okay, you ready?
-Yeah.

29:06.375 --> 29:08.541
-[Borney] All right. You're all set.
-Thanks, Borney.

29:13.208 --> 29:16.208
[Borney] Wow,
your suit's a lot nicer than ours.

29:19.166 --> 29:20.833
My dad got it for me.

29:26.625 --> 29:28.000
So, who wants to do the honors?

29:32.250 --> 29:35.375
Marcus, you should go first.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.416
-Yeah.
-[Dylan] Yeah, man. Definitely.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
Okay.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.291
[Dylan chuckles]

29:42.375 --> 29:43.375
[Marcus] Okay.

30:04.291 --> 30:05.541
[Marcus sighs]

30:10.083 --> 30:12.083
[breathes shakily]

30:17.833 --> 30:18.833
[Dylan chuckles]

30:21.250 --> 30:22.250
[grunts]

30:23.666 --> 30:25.083
[chuckles]

30:25.166 --> 30:27.208
[Borney] Whoa. Whoa.

30:28.333 --> 30:29.333
[Borney chuckles]

30:35.125 --> 30:36.458
[Caleb chuckles]

30:41.583 --> 30:42.583
[chuckles]

30:44.625 --> 30:45.625
[pants]

30:50.083 --> 30:51.083
[sighs]

30:51.166 --> 30:53.416
[Dylan laughs]

30:53.500 --> 30:55.666
Hey, Caleb. Caleb, look!

30:55.750 --> 30:58.166
-[laughs]
-[Caleb] Whoa. [chuckles]

30:58.250 --> 30:59.833
This is awesome.

30:59.916 --> 31:02.208
-[Marcus laughing]
-[Dylan] Whoo!

31:02.291 --> 31:04.208
-[Borney] Look.
-[Marcus] Whoa.

31:04.291 --> 31:06.708
[Dylan] I'm, like, so high! [laughs]

31:06.791 --> 31:08.791
-Whoa.
-[laughing]

31:10.166 --> 31:11.625
[Borney] Whoa.

31:11.708 --> 31:15.916
[Dylan] Yeah! Whoo! [laughs]

31:16.000 --> 31:18.333
Bet you don't get anything like this
on Earth, huh?

31:18.416 --> 31:20.666
[Dylan] This is amazing! [laughs]

31:21.333 --> 31:23.208
[Borney] Wow, look at that.

31:28.666 --> 31:29.833
Is that Earth?

31:31.083 --> 31:33.500
-Hey, Addison, which part did you live on?
-Dude.

31:35.708 --> 31:36.791
What?

31:40.375 --> 31:41.458
You know what?

31:45.166 --> 31:47.250
We're gonna do something fun. [chuckles]

31:49.750 --> 31:51.750
Tied at the bottom of the ninth,

31:51.833 --> 31:53.666
two outs and a loaded count,

31:53.750 --> 31:56.375
Tollefson is at the plate.

31:57.000 --> 32:02.500
Weaver will try to close out
what has been an electrifying game seven.

32:04.041 --> 32:05.208
[gasps]

32:05.291 --> 32:09.375
This is it, ladies and gents,
and the home crowd knows it!

32:09.458 --> 32:11.625
Oh, you can hear them chanting,

32:11.708 --> 32:13.666
"Weaver, Weaver, Weaver, Weaver, Weaver."

32:13.750 --> 32:16.333
-What is she doing?
-No idea.

32:17.208 --> 32:19.666
[imitates crowd cheering]

32:19.750 --> 32:22.333
Here it is, the wind up.

32:25.041 --> 32:26.041
[Addison grunts]

32:27.041 --> 32:28.333
-[metal clinks]
-[Marcus grunts]

32:29.541 --> 32:32.500
[Addison chuckles]
Tollefson hits a doozy towards the center!

32:32.583 --> 32:33.583
[Marcus laughs]

32:33.666 --> 32:36.708
-[Addison] You gotta catch it!
-It's flying into space.

32:38.208 --> 32:40.333
[scoffs] Well, run the bases.

32:40.416 --> 32:42.333
-The what?
-[Dylan sighs]

32:42.916 --> 32:45.291
This is seriously
one of the most popular games on Earth?

32:45.958 --> 32:48.666
Hmm, yeah. With gravity.

32:48.750 --> 32:50.250
-[Caleb] Seriously?
-[Dylan chuckles]

32:50.333 --> 32:51.333
The moon sucks.

32:52.583 --> 32:54.000
[Marcus] I kinda liked it.

32:54.750 --> 32:57.291
-Hey, where are you going?
-On a walk.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.708
-Don't go too far.
-[Addison] Okay, Dad.

33:02.375 --> 33:03.458
[Dylan sighs]

33:12.041 --> 33:13.041
[sighs]

33:20.000 --> 33:21.125
[sighs]

33:40.375 --> 33:41.375
[pants]

33:48.208 --> 33:49.208
[breathes shakily]

33:50.083 --> 33:52.125
-[oxygen tank blowing]
-[Marcus laughs] Hell yeah!

33:52.208 --> 33:53.333
-Go, Dylan!
-[Borney] Come on!

33:53.416 --> 33:55.041
-Don't go higher!
-[Dylan] Hey, Earth girl.

33:55.125 --> 33:56.125
Check it out! [grunts]

33:56.208 --> 33:58.083
-[Caleb] Oh, my God!
-[Borney] Are you seeing this?

33:58.166 --> 34:01.541
[Dylan] All right, remember,
the name of the game is launch-off,

34:01.625 --> 34:03.708
so the more you launch, the higher you go.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.458
So you wanna crouch all the way down,

34:05.541 --> 34:08.625
and launch as hard as you can
while you open the valve.

34:08.708 --> 34:10.250
Are you sure this is safe?

34:10.333 --> 34:13.166
-Of course I-- Borney, don't be a baby.
-You're a baby.

34:13.833 --> 34:17.250
What the hell are you doing?
Are you trying to get yourselves killed?

34:18.291 --> 34:19.291
Don't be dramatic, okay?

34:19.375 --> 34:22.750
All you gotta do is pump the tank a little
on your way down to slow your fall.

34:22.833 --> 34:24.541
Oh, yeah? And what if the cable snaps?

34:24.625 --> 34:26.541
You'll end up miles away
in the middle of space!

34:26.625 --> 34:29.125
This cable can haul thousands of pounds.
I think we'll be okay.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.625
Also you're wasting oxygen!

34:30.708 --> 34:31.958
It's an extra tank.

34:32.041 --> 34:34.333
Which, I'm not quite sure
if you've noticed, we need out here.

34:34.416 --> 34:36.666
If we don't use it,
it'll just go to waste.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.666
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

34:40.750 --> 34:41.750
[Dylan sighs]

34:43.125 --> 34:45.708
[Caleb] Wait, Dylan. [sighs]

34:47.208 --> 34:49.833
What do you know?
You thought baseball was fun.

34:49.916 --> 34:53.208
-There's a meteor shower warning!
-Do you see any meteors?

34:53.291 --> 34:54.458
[scoffs]

34:54.541 --> 34:56.541
Come on, Earth girl.

34:57.416 --> 35:00.000
Just admit it. You're scared.

35:03.583 --> 35:05.583
[Addison screams, chuckles]

35:07.208 --> 35:08.500
Whoo!

35:11.333 --> 35:13.500
[laughing]

35:15.666 --> 35:17.083
I like her.

35:17.166 --> 35:18.166
She's neat.

35:19.666 --> 35:21.125
[Addison] Whoo!

35:21.208 --> 35:22.708
[Dylan] Yeah. She's all right.

35:22.791 --> 35:24.083
[Caleb] Way to go, Addison!

35:24.166 --> 35:26.791
[Addison grunts, chuckles]

35:27.958 --> 35:29.791
[grunting]

35:30.833 --> 35:32.000
[chuckles]

35:32.083 --> 35:34.041
So? What'd you think?

35:35.541 --> 35:40.958
I don't know. I guess
you might have been a tiny bit right.

35:41.041 --> 35:43.458
It was just a little bit of fun.

35:43.541 --> 35:45.041
[chuckles]

35:45.125 --> 35:46.208
[both laugh]

35:53.125 --> 35:54.375
[Dylan] You've got this.

35:57.166 --> 35:58.333
Whoa!

35:58.416 --> 36:00.041
This is amazing!

36:00.125 --> 36:01.916
[laughs]

36:03.375 --> 36:05.083
[laughing] Whoa! Whoa!

36:07.000 --> 36:09.208
Whoo-hoo!

36:09.875 --> 36:10.916
Whoa.

36:11.000 --> 36:11.875
You ready?

36:11.958 --> 36:14.375
No, actually,
I think I left something in the rover.

36:14.458 --> 36:16.208
-[Dylan] Three, two, one.
-What?

36:16.291 --> 36:17.291
-Launch!

36:17.375 --> 36:19.208
[Borney laughing]

36:19.291 --> 36:21.416
[Borney] Masters of our own fate!

36:21.958 --> 36:23.583
-[Caleb] You got this, Dylan.
-[Borney] Yeah!

36:23.666 --> 36:24.833
-Whoo-hoo-hoo!
-Yeah!

36:25.833 --> 36:28.000
-[Borney] Yeah!
-[Addison] Whoo!

36:29.458 --> 36:31.208
-[Caleb] She's doing really good, man.
-High-five!

36:31.291 --> 36:32.916
-Whoa. Whoa.
-[Marcus] Whoo-hoo-hoo!

36:33.000 --> 36:34.541
[Borney] Oh, my God.

36:35.666 --> 36:37.041
Yeah!

36:37.125 --> 36:38.208
Whoa, whoa, wait!

36:39.833 --> 36:41.000
Oh!

36:41.625 --> 36:42.625
Whoo!

36:44.541 --> 36:45.875
[laughs]

37:00.416 --> 37:02.125
[Marcus] All right, let's go, Borney.

37:02.833 --> 37:04.750
-Whoo!
-[chuckles, whoops]

37:04.833 --> 37:06.666
-[Addison] Yeah, Borney!
-Whoa.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.041
[panting]

37:13.625 --> 37:15.083
Whoa!

37:15.166 --> 37:16.625
[Borney screaming]

37:16.708 --> 37:19.041
-No, no, no, no, no, no!
-Borney!

37:19.125 --> 37:20.333
Wh-- What do we do?

37:22.250 --> 37:24.875
[Borney] Please! Please!
I wanna come down.

37:25.541 --> 37:28.125
[grunting, panting]

37:28.208 --> 37:30.750
Borney, listen to me,
you have to shut off the tank.

37:30.833 --> 37:33.000
Shut off the valve on the tank. Okay?

37:34.208 --> 37:36.916
The tank! It slipped. I can't reach it.

37:38.291 --> 37:40.333
If we don't do something,
then we're gonna lose him!

37:40.416 --> 37:42.500
-What are we supposed to do?
-I don't know! You tell me!

37:42.583 --> 37:45.250
[Borney] Please.
I wanna come down, please.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.750
-[Marcus] We need to move. Fast.
-[Addison] And do what?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.708
-[Dylan] Marcus, what are you doing?
-[Addison] Marcus!

37:50.708 --> 37:51.708
Mm-hmm.

37:51.791 --> 37:53.041
[Dylan, Caleb panting]

37:53.125 --> 37:54.958
Wait! I'm coming with you.

37:55.458 --> 37:56.708
You need to guide us.

37:56.791 --> 37:59.208
-We need you to be our eyes down here.
-[panting] I…

38:00.250 --> 38:02.083
Come on, Earth girl. We need you.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.500
Okay.

38:06.583 --> 38:09.333
[Caleb grunting, panting]

38:10.791 --> 38:13.250
Marcus, your angle is off.
You need to go to your right!

38:15.083 --> 38:17.958
Once Borney unhooks his tank,
he's gonna start to fall.

38:18.041 --> 38:19.583
You're gonna need to catch him.

38:20.458 --> 38:21.708
We're gonna get him back.

38:22.708 --> 38:26.125
Hey! Hey! We're gonna get him back.

38:27.041 --> 38:29.000
-[Addison] Borney, you're doing great.
-[Borney] I'm scared.

38:29.083 --> 38:30.958
[Addison] Try and stay calm.
Everything's gonna be fine.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.750
-[Borney] Okay.
-[Addison] Come on!

38:33.416 --> 38:35.041
[Dylan, Caleb grunting]

38:35.125 --> 38:37.750
Borney, Marcus is on his way.

38:38.250 --> 38:41.208
Please, I need you to listen to me.
You need to unhook your tank.

38:41.291 --> 38:42.875
-I see him! I see him!
-[Addison] Okay?

38:42.958 --> 38:44.166
Borney, you can do it!

38:44.250 --> 38:46.708
Reach down, grab the strap, then pull.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.916
[Borney screaming]

38:49.000 --> 38:51.625
-[Addison] Marcus! Look out!
-[grunting]

38:52.333 --> 38:54.333
[Borney screams] Marcus!

38:54.416 --> 38:57.625
-Reach for my hand!
-Help me. Help me, please, Marcus.

38:57.708 --> 38:58.958
-I got him.
-[grunts]

38:59.541 --> 39:01.125
[Borney] I-- I can't hold on!

39:01.208 --> 39:03.083
-I can't hold on!
-[Marcus] Borney!

39:03.166 --> 39:04.541
[Borney] Oh, God, help!

39:04.625 --> 39:06.916
[Addison] No! No, no, no, no! [whimpers]

39:07.000 --> 39:08.083
I'm right behind ya!

39:09.666 --> 39:11.750
[all grunting]

39:11.833 --> 39:13.291
Watch out! Watch out!

39:13.375 --> 39:15.208
[Caleb grunts]

39:15.291 --> 39:17.166
[all grunting, screaming]

39:17.250 --> 39:18.125
[Borney screams]

39:18.208 --> 39:19.125
Whoa! Whoa!

39:21.250 --> 39:25.083
[all screaming, grunting]

39:26.208 --> 39:28.958
[panting]

39:29.041 --> 39:31.666
[groans, sighs]

39:31.750 --> 39:34.750
[all grunting]

39:36.166 --> 39:39.041
[Marcus panting]
I think I prefer baseball.

39:39.125 --> 39:41.708
[grunting, coughing]

39:41.791 --> 39:43.708
[Dylan] Borney! Borney! Are you okay?

39:43.791 --> 39:45.333
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-[Dylan] You're sure?

39:45.416 --> 39:46.416
Okay. Okay.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.208
Hey, you better patch up that strap.

39:48.291 --> 39:49.958
Luckily,
someone grabbed the crack-smacker.

39:50.041 --> 39:51.041
Are you okay?

39:52.541 --> 39:54.333
[Dylan] Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

39:56.541 --> 39:57.875
I think we have to go back.

39:59.416 --> 40:00.750
-What?
-[Marcus grunts]

40:03.000 --> 40:05.416
To the dome. We have to go back.

40:07.750 --> 40:11.500
Look. I get it, okay? I get it.

40:11.583 --> 40:12.666
You were right.

40:13.750 --> 40:14.750
It was stupid.

40:14.833 --> 40:17.000
Do you really think I care
about being right?

40:18.458 --> 40:20.958
It's just math. We used too much oxygen.

40:21.041 --> 40:22.291
You don't know that. [pants]

40:22.375 --> 40:25.458
[Addison] You said that you only brought
one extra tank. We lost two.

40:25.541 --> 40:28.583
Plus whatever you guys used
getting out there and back.

40:29.333 --> 40:31.416
We wouldn't even have enough
to make it to the crater.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.458
[pants] Oh, my God.
We can figure something out. Right?

40:38.041 --> 40:41.041
We all played. It's not your fault.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
Wait.

40:47.041 --> 40:48.250
What if we can get more?

40:49.083 --> 40:50.083
How?

40:50.166 --> 40:51.500
You still have that projector thingy?

40:51.583 --> 40:53.208
[Dylan] Wait. How is that gonna work?

40:53.291 --> 40:55.125
Look. Come with me. I'll show you.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.666
[Dylan, Caleb panting]

41:03.166 --> 41:05.666
-No, turn to the left.
-I…

41:05.750 --> 41:06.750
This is left.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.750
-Are you looking for the-- Oh!
-Yeah.

41:09.833 --> 41:12.416
-What are we looking for?
-Ooh! Wait. Right there.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.625
-Hey!
-[Dylan] Well, zoom right there! Please?

41:19.625 --> 41:20.833
[Addison] What is this?

41:20.916 --> 41:22.500
[Caleb] That's where we get more oxygen.

41:22.583 --> 41:24.208
It's an old outpost
from the first settlement.

41:24.291 --> 41:27.750
It's where miners used to get supplies
for long-range digs.

41:28.916 --> 41:30.541
Do you think there's anything left?

41:30.625 --> 41:31.458
[sighs]

41:31.541 --> 41:34.958
[Caleb] There has to be. It's the only way
we make it to the crater.

41:43.708 --> 41:45.208
[Addison] Dylan, even if this works,

41:45.291 --> 41:47.458
we're gonna be out here
a lot longer than we planned.

41:47.541 --> 41:50.625
[Dylan] Okay, but there's time.
Lockdown's not even halfway over.

41:50.708 --> 41:53.625
[Addison] I'm just saying.
At some point, we're gonna have to sleep.

41:53.708 --> 41:56.916
[Dylan] Right, sure.
Let's make sure we can breathe first.

42:00.250 --> 42:03.416
So if we're not going back to the dome,
then where are we going?

42:03.500 --> 42:04.708
We're going to an outpost.

42:04.791 --> 42:06.416
It's where we're gonna get more oxygen.

42:06.500 --> 42:09.166
An outpost? What outpost?

42:10.041 --> 42:11.791
There's nothing out here except for--

42:13.958 --> 42:16.458
-Wait a minute, not the outpost?
-Here we go.

42:16.541 --> 42:18.958
Are you kidding me? That's the outpost!

42:19.041 --> 42:20.333
-We can't go there.
-[Dylan groans]

42:20.416 --> 42:22.375
Borney, those are just stories.

42:22.458 --> 42:23.791
Wait. [chuckles] What?

42:24.958 --> 42:26.791
Space ghosts, that's what.

42:26.875 --> 42:29.000
-We gotta turn around.
-No. We're not turning around.

42:29.083 --> 42:32.208
Borney,
there is no such thing as space ghosts.

42:32.291 --> 42:34.500
You don't know.
You guys think you know everything.

42:34.583 --> 42:36.666
-My brother told me--
-No, for crying out loud!

42:37.833 --> 42:40.291
You know what? Your brother? He sucks.

42:41.416 --> 42:42.833
-Take that back.
-[Dylan] No.

42:42.916 --> 42:43.916
I said, take it back.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.791
No. Because he messes
with your head. Okay?

42:45.875 --> 42:47.166
He tells you all these stories

42:47.250 --> 42:49.750
so that you'll walk around
scared of your own shadow all the time.

42:49.833 --> 42:51.750
-The guy's a total loser!
-You're a loser!

42:51.833 --> 42:53.708
-Fine! He's a bigger loser!
-All right. That's enough.

42:53.791 --> 42:55.500
At least I don't have any cowards
in my family.

42:57.083 --> 42:58.125
What'd you say?

42:59.791 --> 43:01.166
-Come here!
-[Caleb] Hey!

43:01.250 --> 43:02.375
-Stop!
-[Dylan] Wanna talk now?

43:02.458 --> 43:04.791
-Don't talk about my brother!
-Hey, Dylan! Stop!

43:04.875 --> 43:06.375
-You wanna talk now?
-Get off me!

43:06.458 --> 43:07.750
[both grunting]

43:07.833 --> 43:09.333
-Enough!
-You know, what? Get off me!

43:09.416 --> 43:11.541
-[Caleb] Get off him.
-You hear what he said?

43:11.625 --> 43:13.833
Hey, everybody knock it off!

43:13.916 --> 43:15.916
[panting]

43:18.083 --> 43:20.708
Is this how you guys wanna spend
our last few days together?

43:24.375 --> 43:25.375
Come on.

43:28.833 --> 43:30.000
[Borney] I'm sorry.

43:31.958 --> 43:33.041
Really.

43:34.750 --> 43:36.291
I shouldn't have said that.

43:41.541 --> 43:44.541
Yeah. Me too.

43:51.416 --> 43:53.416
-I love you, buddy. [chuckles]
-[Borney scoffs]

43:54.125 --> 43:55.958
[Borney] Yeah, yeah. I love you too.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
[chuckles]

44:05.375 --> 44:07.500
[Addison]
You really think there's oxygen in there?

44:07.583 --> 44:10.458
[Caleb] I mean, it should be.
These outposts were supply centers.

44:10.541 --> 44:12.833
[Marcus]
But that was a long time ago. Right?

44:13.625 --> 44:14.791
[Addison] How long?

44:15.500 --> 44:16.666
[metallic thud]

44:19.333 --> 44:20.500
[door beeps, opens]

44:36.541 --> 44:39.541
[all breathing shakily]

44:40.500 --> 44:41.916
-[Caleb] Hey.
-[Marcus] What the--

44:42.000 --> 44:43.166
[Caleb] Uh…

44:47.875 --> 44:49.083
Uh, what?

44:50.333 --> 44:52.333
Oh. [sighs]

44:54.666 --> 44:59.458
The sooner we turn the lights on,
the sooner we get the oxygen tanks, right?

45:00.541 --> 45:01.541
-Yeah.
-Right.

45:18.166 --> 45:19.833
-[Dylan gasps]
-[Addison] Come on.

45:23.708 --> 45:24.750
Careful.

45:35.500 --> 45:36.916
Space ghost!

45:37.000 --> 45:40.041
[all screaming]

45:40.125 --> 45:41.666
-[Dylan] Oh, my God!
-[Addison screams]

45:41.750 --> 45:44.041
[screaming]

45:44.125 --> 45:45.833
[screams, grunts]

45:45.916 --> 45:47.041
[screaming]

45:47.125 --> 45:49.125
[electricity powers up]

45:49.875 --> 45:50.875
Huh?

45:50.958 --> 45:52.041
[Marcus] Hmm.

45:52.125 --> 45:54.208
These space ghosts have nice taste.

45:54.291 --> 45:55.791
-[Borney] What the…
-What is this place?

45:55.875 --> 45:59.125
This isn't an outpost. It's a model home.

45:59.208 --> 46:00.208
[Borney] Huh?

46:00.291 --> 46:01.375
[Caleb] A what?

46:03.041 --> 46:07.666
Whenever developers on Earth would build
new communities, like, nice ones,

46:07.750 --> 46:11.875
they'd usually always start out with
one house that was, like, a showcase.

46:13.500 --> 46:16.083
[Borney] This is what the houses here
would have looked like?

46:16.166 --> 46:17.625
It's really nice.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.458
I mean, these things are
super creepy, but…

46:20.541 --> 46:23.000
At least we don't have to sleep
in the rover tonight.

46:23.083 --> 46:26.250
Uh, you're still sleeping in the rover.
You snore.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.333
I just can't wait
to get out of these suits. [chuckles]

46:34.833 --> 46:35.875
[Addison] Whoa.

46:48.500 --> 46:51.083
This place is supposed to be packed
with surplus equipment.

46:53.958 --> 46:54.958
Where is everything?

46:55.041 --> 46:56.750
[Addison] There's a bunch of rooms
we have to check.

46:56.833 --> 46:58.291
[Dylan] Yeah, I guess.

46:58.375 --> 46:59.750
Who was Borney talking about?

47:01.541 --> 47:04.750
-Uh, in the rover. Who was he--
-Yeah, I know what you meant.

47:04.833 --> 47:06.250
What do you wanna know for?

47:07.958 --> 47:09.291
God, you're so--

47:09.375 --> 47:12.750
Just forget I even asked.
There's no oxygen here.

47:13.750 --> 47:15.500
[Dylan] All right, fine.

47:16.583 --> 47:19.916
Remember how I said my dad still had
six years left to work off from his dad

47:20.000 --> 47:21.833
before he could even start his own 20?

47:24.916 --> 47:27.916
Well, one day, he just--
He just couldn't take it anymore.

47:28.833 --> 47:31.833
He decided to sneak onto
one of the shuttles back to Earth.

47:34.583 --> 47:36.833
They told my mom
they found him right after takeoff.

47:41.041 --> 47:42.125
Don't do that.

47:44.208 --> 47:45.583
-Don't do what?
-Don't-- Don't--

47:45.666 --> 47:49.041
Don't stand there and look at me
like you feel bad for me, okay?

47:49.125 --> 47:51.208
You wanna feel bad for someone?
Feel bad for Borney.

47:51.291 --> 47:54.083
'Cause I love the kid,
but he's not built for this place.

47:54.166 --> 47:56.250
Marcus?
He probably got born with that heart

47:56.333 --> 47:58.125
because his family's
been up here too long.

47:58.208 --> 47:59.541
Screwed him all up.

47:59.625 --> 48:01.208
So you wanna feel bad for someone?

48:02.125 --> 48:04.500
Feel bad for them,
because I don't need your pity.

48:05.833 --> 48:06.833
Pity? I wasn't…

48:08.000 --> 48:11.541
God, you guys think that you're the only
people who have problems in your life.

48:11.625 --> 48:13.291
What, you think my life is perfect?

48:14.250 --> 48:16.041
-I don't know.
-[Addison] No, you don't know.

48:16.541 --> 48:17.958
I bet you don't know a thing about me.

48:18.041 --> 48:20.166
I'm just the girl who helped you
and your friends steal a rover

48:20.250 --> 48:22.041
so that you could have
your little adventure.

48:23.125 --> 48:24.208
Right?

48:25.250 --> 48:26.250
[sighs]

48:26.333 --> 48:27.875
I don't feel bad for you.

48:28.583 --> 48:30.333
I was just trying to get to know you.

48:31.583 --> 48:33.875
[footsteps departing]

48:33.958 --> 48:34.791
[door opens]

48:36.541 --> 48:37.875
I don't snore.

48:37.958 --> 48:39.041
Are you kidding me?

48:39.125 --> 48:41.208
Every time you take a nap,
the ground shakes on Omega.

48:41.291 --> 48:42.291
That's not true.

48:42.375 --> 48:44.458
How would you know?
You're too busy sleeping.

48:45.625 --> 48:46.625
I'd know.

48:49.875 --> 48:51.208
Whoa!

48:51.291 --> 48:52.625
That's a lot of stuff.

48:53.958 --> 48:55.958
[sighs] This is gonna take forever.

48:56.625 --> 48:57.625
[Marcus grunts]

48:58.625 --> 49:02.041
Hey, do you think
Caleb's having a good time?

49:04.166 --> 49:08.958
I mean, I know he's sad about leaving,
about his dad.

49:09.041 --> 49:10.041
But I just…

49:12.208 --> 49:13.916
I want him to have a good time, you know?

49:16.291 --> 49:17.333
I know.

49:18.666 --> 49:20.708
[clattering]

49:20.791 --> 49:23.333
[roars, laughs]

49:26.708 --> 49:28.791
Promise me you'll always take your pills.

49:35.291 --> 49:36.375
Promise!

49:39.041 --> 49:41.458
Okay. Promise.

50:02.333 --> 50:03.541
[Caleb] Dad?

50:03.625 --> 50:04.791
You in here?

50:05.416 --> 50:06.416
[Michael] What?

50:07.875 --> 50:09.750
Dad,
why were you just sitting in the dark?

50:10.541 --> 50:12.083
[Michael] The math doesn't work.

50:13.416 --> 50:14.541
[Caleb] What?

50:14.625 --> 50:16.125
There's not enough time.

50:17.166 --> 50:18.666
The math doesn't work.

50:19.708 --> 50:20.708
Dad,

50:22.208 --> 50:23.541
what are you talking about?

50:27.708 --> 50:30.875
When your mom was pregnant,
she was so scared you'd end up stuck here.

50:32.375 --> 50:34.583
Turn 18
before we finished out the contract.

50:36.458 --> 50:37.958
But the math worked, see?

50:39.500 --> 50:42.500
As long as we worked hard, stayed focused.

50:45.250 --> 50:46.750
But your mom got sick.

50:49.083 --> 50:50.666
And I took too much time.

50:54.083 --> 50:55.333
Figured I'd make it up.

50:56.375 --> 50:58.208
Work it off before you turned 18.

50:59.041 --> 51:00.708
Before they put 20 years on you.

51:03.041 --> 51:06.291
And I tried, buddy, I did. I tried.

51:09.541 --> 51:12.083
-[feedback on comm]
-[Borney] Hey! Hey, Caleb, are you there?

51:15.041 --> 51:16.250
Any luck?

51:16.333 --> 51:20.083
Oh, yeah!
And we didn't just find the oxygen tanks.

51:20.958 --> 51:22.375
We found a feast!

51:22.458 --> 51:25.000
[both laugh]

51:27.208 --> 51:29.791
-[Dylan groans]
-[Borney] What a meal.

51:29.875 --> 51:32.375
-That was amazing.
-[Marcus] Mmm, mmm.

51:32.458 --> 51:36.291
[sighs] I never-- I never knew there were
so many different types of food.

51:36.875 --> 51:37.875
[Addison] Want some?

51:37.958 --> 51:38.916
[burps]

51:39.000 --> 51:40.916
-[Marcus] Nice one.
-That was impressive.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.416
I don't think I'm ever going to eat
anything ever again.

51:44.041 --> 51:47.791
There's so many flavors right in my mouth
right now, I don't even know what to do.

51:47.875 --> 51:49.208
-What is that?
-Um…

51:49.916 --> 51:52.666
It's called, uh, "freeze-dried ice cream."

51:53.208 --> 51:54.291
Is it good?

51:54.375 --> 51:56.500
I think it is the most amazing thing
I've ever tasted.

51:56.583 --> 51:58.166
-Here, let me try it.
-Wait.

51:58.250 --> 51:59.333
No, let me try it.

52:00.250 --> 52:01.250
-Give me some.
-Hey.

52:01.333 --> 52:02.625
You can't hog it all. Dude! Dylan!

52:02.708 --> 52:04.083
-Oh, my God! This is amazing.
-You can't--

52:04.166 --> 52:06.083
-You can't hog it all to yourself.
-Come on. Give me some.

52:06.166 --> 52:07.291
-Oh.
-Oh, yeah.

52:07.375 --> 52:09.375
-Dude, come on. One piece.
-[Caleb laughs]

52:12.458 --> 52:15.791
So, the whole freaking world
was actually at war with each other.

52:17.333 --> 52:19.458
Literally millions of people died.

52:19.541 --> 52:20.875
That's insane.

52:20.958 --> 52:22.708
[Addison] Yeah, I mean,
that's not the only part.

52:22.791 --> 52:25.041
The entire thing happened
again 20 years later.

52:25.750 --> 52:28.291
You wouldn't believe the stuff
that you find in history books.

52:29.708 --> 52:30.791
You guys would love it.

52:30.875 --> 52:34.208
It's just all of this stuff that dates
back, like, thousands of years.

52:35.125 --> 52:38.750
All these different cultures
and belief systems and…

52:40.291 --> 52:43.291
It's all so beautiful and so sad and so…

52:45.500 --> 52:48.416
I don't know. It's just all of this stuff
really happened.

52:48.500 --> 52:51.833
To people who thought it was the most
important thing in the entire universe.

52:52.750 --> 52:56.583
And Earth was everything to them.

52:58.708 --> 53:03.541
Now, it's like all anybody cares about is
when they get to go to Omega.

53:12.291 --> 53:14.875
My brother always really loved history.

53:15.708 --> 53:16.958
You have a brother?

53:19.583 --> 53:21.583
Yeah, his name is Charlie.

53:22.750 --> 53:24.250
He's ten.

53:25.041 --> 53:29.375
He's on a transport ship with my mom
to Omega right now.

53:32.750 --> 53:33.750
See,

53:34.958 --> 53:37.541
when my parents got divorced…

53:39.875 --> 53:45.416
it wasn't enough for my mom to just move
out of the house like a normal person.

53:47.250 --> 53:50.875
She actually chose to spend 75 years
in a cryogenic sleep,

53:50.958 --> 53:52.958
so she'd never have to see my dad again.

53:57.833 --> 53:58.916
And my dad,

53:59.708 --> 54:04.041
for some reason,
just couldn't let her have the last word.

54:04.125 --> 54:06.958
So he just had to leave Earth too.

54:09.416 --> 54:10.875
So, here we are.

54:17.666 --> 54:20.375
She brought Charlie with her
onto the transport ship last year.

54:25.458 --> 54:26.708
I lost my best friend.

54:30.833 --> 54:31.833
Sorry.

54:36.916 --> 54:41.333
Yeah, well, I don't need your pity.
[laughs, sniffles]

54:44.791 --> 54:47.041
[beeping]

54:48.291 --> 54:50.916
Hey, hey. Borney,
be careful over there. Don't--

54:51.000 --> 54:52.583

54:52.666 --> 54:53.666
Borney.

Welcome to the Alpha Project.

54:56.041 --> 54:59.125
You are one of the lucky few
who were selected to receive

54:59.208 --> 55:03.625
the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
to purchase one of our luxury condos

55:03.708 --> 55:05.791
here on the lunar surface.

55:05.875 --> 55:07.625
Are you excited?

55:07.708 --> 55:09.916
You're listening to Alpha Radio.

55:10.000 --> 55:13.666

and listen to some golden oldies.

55:13.750 --> 55:15.375
["Miracle Mile" playing on speakers]

55:15.458 --> 55:17.458
Geez. When is this from?

55:18.375 --> 55:21.000
Don't look at me.
I'm from Earth, and I've never heard this.

55:23.500 --> 55:26.000
[Borney sighs] Man,
I wish they kept building.

55:26.500 --> 55:28.250
This would've been
a really nice place to live.

55:28.333 --> 55:29.750
[Dylan] This place was never meant for us.

55:29.833 --> 55:32.250
[Borney] Okay, but no one's ever gonna
use this place again.

55:33.750 --> 55:35.541
[Caleb] Listen to me.

55:35.625 --> 55:39.708
This place is every promise they ever made
and never meant to keep.

55:39.791 --> 55:41.875
Just like the contracts people signed.

55:43.583 --> 55:46.500
They could've made it so much better here,
and they just didn't care.

55:46.583 --> 55:48.083
So why should we?

55:49.166 --> 55:50.166
[Borney chuckles]

55:51.833 --> 55:52.833

[Addison] What?

58:45.166 --> 58:46.375
Because I already had one.

58:47.208 --> 58:48.833
[Caleb] He talks in his sleep a lot.

58:48.916 --> 58:49.958
[Addison] You're kidding.

58:50.041 --> 58:51.875
It's really weird.

58:51.958 --> 58:55.000
Most people mumble. Dylan has arguments.

58:55.083 --> 58:56.083
[chuckles]

59:00.750 --> 59:01.916
They're gonna miss you.

59:03.625 --> 59:05.375
[sighs] I know.

59:11.458 --> 59:16.708
The first time I met Dylan,
it was the night my mom died.

59:18.166 --> 59:19.791
Then I went to the commissary.

59:21.333 --> 59:24.458
I'd been crying nonstop for hours and,
I guess,

59:24.541 --> 59:27.291
all of a sudden I just realized
how hungry I was.

59:28.833 --> 59:33.333
It was like after all that,
if I could just get a sandwich,

59:34.041 --> 59:35.625
maybe everything would be okay.

59:37.875 --> 59:40.875
But when I got to the commissary,
everything was locked for the night.

59:41.916 --> 59:43.000
What did you do?

59:43.875 --> 59:48.291
Well, um, I was about
to head back to the dorms

59:48.375 --> 59:52.708
when all of a sudden Dylan comes out
of the air vent above the door.

59:53.625 --> 59:54.875
[chuckles]

59:54.958 --> 59:58.291
He said he'd been breaking in for months
to steal fruit tarts for his mom.

59:59.375 --> 01:00:04.541
[chuckles] So we snuck back inside
and spent the rest of the night

01:00:04.625 --> 01:00:07.625
in a giant refrigerator eating sandwiches.

01:00:08.666 --> 01:00:09.666
[chuckles]

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:13.875
I didn't even know who he was,

01:00:14.791 --> 01:00:17.291
and he still sat there with me
the whole night.

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:28.291
Why'd you tell me all that?

01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:34.291
Because I think
it's gonna be hard for him.

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:36.250
When I'm gone.

01:00:37.125 --> 01:00:38.791
Harder for him than the others.

01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:42.541
He might need someone to stay up with him,

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:44.666
eat some sandwiches. [chuckles]

01:00:50.166 --> 01:00:51.500
Hmm, I barely know him.

01:00:51.583 --> 01:00:53.083
Well, he didn't know me either.

01:00:57.041 --> 01:00:58.041
[sighs]

01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:11.041
You know, we're kind of the same.

01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:13.333
What do you mean?

01:01:14.416 --> 01:01:17.916
Well, neither of us really gets to be
who we are anymore.

01:01:20.458 --> 01:01:22.125
We're both something different now.

01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:27.125
I'm just the girl from Earth,

01:01:28.166 --> 01:01:30.083
and you're just the boy
whose parents died.

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:40.541
I already told you,
it's not supposed to be green.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.958
[Addison, Caleb chuckling]

01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:45.208
[Caleb] Yeah.

01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:06.791
Hey, are we there yet?

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:07.875
[all] No.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.000
We're five minutes closer
than the last time you asked though.

01:02:11.083 --> 01:02:12.166
Okay, well, how much further?

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.166
The map only says
about another mile or so.

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:23.500
I don't-- I don't know. It just--

01:02:24.375 --> 01:02:25.375
What?

01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:27.125
What did you do?

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:30.208
I didn't do anything. [sighs]
It's an old model. It just--

01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:31.458
[sighs] Come on.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.125
[sighs] We're so screwed.

01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:36.000
[Dylan] Come on, come on, come on.

01:02:36.083 --> 01:02:37.083
[Caleb] Okay.

01:02:37.791 --> 01:02:39.625
How much oxygen did we get from the depot?

01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:41.875
Not enough to make it back
to the colony on foot.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.000
Well, how about to get to the crater?

01:02:44.083 --> 01:02:46.125
[Dylan] Oh, yeah,
we got enough for that, but…

01:02:46.625 --> 01:02:47.708
I don't know.

when they catch us out here.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:01.291
We're gonna be in even more trouble
if they don't.

01:03:01.375 --> 01:03:04.625
Look, the good news is
that the rescue vehicles can't leave

01:03:04.708 --> 01:03:06.375
until the dome's lockdown is over.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:09.333
We've got plenty of time
to get to the crater and back.

01:03:09.416 --> 01:03:11.666
Don't you guys really wanna know
what's out there?

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:17.875

I need you to promise me something.

01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:02.083
Will you promise me?

01:04:03.208 --> 01:04:04.208
Okay.

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:08.083
Anything ever happens to me,

01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:11.625
you promise me you'll get out there
to the crater, like we talked about.

01:04:11.708 --> 01:04:13.708
Wait, Dad. What's gonna happen to you?

01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:16.166
Nothing.

01:04:16.875 --> 01:04:17.875
I just--

01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:20.958
I promised your mom.

01:04:21.041 --> 01:04:22.125
The night she died,

01:04:24.041 --> 01:04:27.791
I held her hand,
and I promised her you'd see it.

01:04:29.916 --> 01:04:31.333
So you promise me now.

01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:33.541
You promise me you'll go.

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:37.958
Okay. I promise.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.541
[Michael] Okay, no matter what.

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:42.875
And you look for the place with the brook.

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:44.958

Dad, I don't know what that means. I--

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:56.333
It's okay, you will.

01:04:56.875 --> 01:04:58.208
You'll see.

01:04:58.291 --> 01:04:59.291
Okay?

01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:02.875
Good.

01:05:03.708 --> 01:05:04.791
Good man.

01:05:14.291 --> 01:05:15.708
[Michael groans]

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:19.833
Hey.

01:05:22.291 --> 01:05:23.375
I love you, Caleb.

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:25.541
More than anything.

01:05:26.458 --> 01:05:27.708
You know that, right?

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:32.375
Yeah, Dad. Love you too.

01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:37.041
My baby boy.

01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:45.708
[Dylan panting]

01:05:49.416 --> 01:05:50.500
[Dylan] Hey, guys.

01:05:54.208 --> 01:05:55.291
I think we're here.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.166
Come on. [pants]

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.708
[all panting]

01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:10.083
[Borney grunts]

01:06:14.916 --> 01:06:16.000
[Dylan] We made it.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.833
-[Marcus] What do you think it is?
-[Caleb] Wow.

01:06:19.958 --> 01:06:22.958
[Dylan] We really did it. [chuckles]
We're here, man.

01:06:23.916 --> 01:06:25.000
[Caleb] Yeah.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.791
Hey, last one down
doesn't get any treasure.

01:06:28.875 --> 01:06:29.958
[Marcus] W-Wait, Borney.

01:06:30.041 --> 01:06:31.000
[Borney] Oh, whoa.

01:06:31.625 --> 01:06:34.125
Whoa. Whoa. [chuckles]

01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:38.166
Whoa. [chuckles] Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:39.250
Marcus?

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.166
-[Addison] Whoo!
-[Marcus] Whoa!

01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:46.875
You ever have this much fun on Earth?

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:49.250
[Addison]
I've never had this much fun anywhere.

01:06:49.333 --> 01:06:51.333
[Addison, Marcus laughing]

01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:55.666
Hey, you coming?

01:06:56.791 --> 01:06:57.791
Yeah.

01:06:58.416 --> 01:06:59.416
Okay.

01:07:05.541 --> 01:07:09.500
[Dylan laughing] Whoo! Whoo!

01:07:12.916 --> 01:07:14.000
[Caleb grunts]

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:15.166
[Caleb] Yeah.

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:17.833
[chuckling] Whoa.

01:07:17.916 --> 01:07:21.375
[Dylan] Caleb! This is awesome!

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:22.458
Yeah!

01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:24.750
[Caleb, Dylan laughing]

01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:31.458
-[Caleb] Whoa.
-[Dylan] Whoa.

01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:33.125
[Borney] Hey, Marcus. Any luck?

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.125
[Marcus] I'm still looking.

01:07:36.666 --> 01:07:38.375
[Addison] Hey, guys. Come look at this.

01:07:47.583 --> 01:07:48.708
[Dylan] What does it mean?

01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:52.916
[Marcus] Guys,
I found the control for the door.

01:07:54.416 --> 01:07:55.833
[Caleb] Guess we'll find out.

01:07:57.333 --> 01:07:58.333
[door opens]

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:06.666
[Dylan sighs]

01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:11.666
[Marcus] You first, Caleb.

01:08:12.375 --> 01:08:13.458
Hey, you got this.

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:19.625
[Marcus panting]

01:08:34.666 --> 01:08:38.291
[panting]

01:08:41.416 --> 01:08:42.750
[Addison exhales]

01:08:44.666 --> 01:08:45.666
[Caleb grunts]

01:08:54.166 --> 01:08:55.166
[Dylan sighs]

01:09:04.958 --> 01:09:06.375
[Borney] Oh, come on.

01:09:07.208 --> 01:09:08.458
[Dylan] This can't be it.

01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:12.041
It's just a giant empty room.

01:09:14.708 --> 01:09:16.125
I think we're at the wrong place.

01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:18.791
[sighs]

01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:22.541
Maybe whatever used to
be here is just gone.

01:09:23.416 --> 01:09:24.416
[sighs]

01:09:27.708 --> 01:09:28.708
Wow.

01:09:29.958 --> 01:09:32.625
"On gilded wings
we have reached the stars.

01:09:33.791 --> 01:09:37.458
But let us never forget the skies
we left behind."

01:09:38.291 --> 01:09:39.291
[Addison exhales]

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
What are you doing?

01:09:45.958 --> 01:09:47.833
I've been in a room like this before.

01:09:48.625 --> 01:09:50.041
Just give me a second.

01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:02.291
[gasps]

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.000
[Caleb] Wow. [chuckles]

01:10:06.083 --> 01:10:07.416
[Addison chuckling]

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.500
[Borney] Cool!

01:10:13.166 --> 01:10:14.166
What's going on?

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.916
[Borney] I think we're gonna die.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.416
[Dylan] We're not gonna die, Borney.

01:10:17.916 --> 01:10:19.291
[Addison] Just give it a second.

01:10:25.291 --> 01:10:28.833
-[Marcus gasps] Are you guys seeing this?
-[Addison chuckles]

01:10:31.375 --> 01:10:34.250
[birds chirping]

01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:35.916
[Borney] Marcus. Marcus, look!

01:10:41.291 --> 01:10:42.625
[Marcus] It's beautiful.

01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:46.791
Wow.

01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:48.291
[Borney] Whoa.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
[Addison chuckling]

01:10:55.666 --> 01:10:56.916
[Marcus] I can't believe it.

01:10:57.708 --> 01:10:58.875
[Dylan] Is that--

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.583
That's Earth.

01:11:04.708 --> 01:11:05.791
That's home.

01:11:08.208 --> 01:11:09.208
[chuckles]

01:11:10.541 --> 01:11:12.041
[gasping]

01:11:14.208 --> 01:11:16.041
[Addison chuckling]

01:11:16.125 --> 01:11:17.125
Look!

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:21.333
[Marcus] It is blue. [chuckles]

01:11:29.375 --> 01:11:32.458
[Borney] See? I told you guys
there'd be treasure.

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.500
-[Dylan chuckles, sighs]
-[Addison giggles]

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:37.583
[water running]

01:11:56.750 --> 01:12:00.083
[electricity humming]

01:12:00.166 --> 01:12:01.166
Huh?

01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:03.166
-What?
-[Marcus] No.

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:06.208
[Borney] No. No, what happ--
What happened?

01:12:07.208 --> 01:12:08.541
[Marcus] Is that all there is?

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:09.625
[Addison] I don't know.

01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:12.416
-[Borney] No, no, no. No. No!
-[Marcus] Make it come back.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.291
-You can make it come back, right?
-Where did it go?

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:16.875
-[Addison] Look, I can try.
-[Marcus] Please.

01:12:32.416 --> 01:12:34.250
Hey. Hey, Caleb, what did you find?

01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:36.250
[Marcus shushing]

01:13:22.541 --> 01:13:23.541
[sighs]

01:13:33.958 --> 01:13:36.958
Hey, your dad would've wanted this.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.333
-[Caleb sniffles]
-He would've been proud.

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:40.625
Don't say that.

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:41.708
What?

01:13:42.375 --> 01:13:43.541
Hey, Caleb, stop.

01:13:46.625 --> 01:13:49.416
Look, I get it's hard. Okay? I get it.

01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:50.833
But, you can't just--

01:13:50.916 --> 01:13:52.416
It wasn't an accident.

01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:55.875
In the mines.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:59.041
What happened wasn't an accident.

01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:01.541
My dad knew about the death benefit.

01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:04.625
He knew if anything happened to him
that I'd get to go to Omega.

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.875
When we get back, I'm telling Ms. Slater.

01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:11.041
What?

01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:14.750
Maybe she'll cancel the contract,
revoke the benefit.

01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:16.541
I could stay.

01:14:19.916 --> 01:14:23.333
Look, everything about this sucks.

01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:26.125
But none of that matters.

01:14:26.208 --> 01:14:28.333
Because you're the one that gets to go.

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:33.500
Whatever you think your dad did,
he did it because he loved you.

01:14:35.708 --> 01:14:38.041
Dude, I would give anything
to get off this rock.

01:14:38.125 --> 01:14:39.875
We all would. And you know that.

01:14:39.958 --> 01:14:42.083
But we're gonna spend
the rest of our lives here.

01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:43.250
And that's fine.

01:14:44.833 --> 01:14:46.541
You know why?

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:49.583
Because when you go,
a part of us gets to go too.

01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:51.541
You're gonna be out there
for the rest of us.

01:14:52.416 --> 01:14:54.083
It's gonna be amazing.

01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:56.375
-You're gonna forget all about this place.
-No, I won't.

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:57.875
[Dylan] Yes, you will.

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:00.500
And you should.

01:15:02.375 --> 01:15:04.875
Caleb, you've got
so much more ahead of you.

01:15:06.166 --> 01:15:09.333
So many things you're gonna see and do.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.166
You're gonna be a leader.

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:16.583
Somebody people depend on.

01:15:18.125 --> 01:15:20.708
Somebody that goes
where other people are scared to go.

01:15:24.625 --> 01:15:26.541
You don't think we're gonna
let you ruin that, do you?

01:15:26.625 --> 01:15:28.083
-[Marcus groans]
-[body thuds]

01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:29.125
[Borney] Marcus! Hey!

01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:30.333
Oh, my God!

01:15:30.416 --> 01:15:31.666
-Hey! Marcus!
-[Dylan] Hey, it's okay.

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.125
Hey. I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:15:33.208 --> 01:15:35.083
-[grunts] What happened?
-[Marcus] It's okay.

01:15:35.166 --> 01:15:36.875
His heart rate is way too low.

01:15:36.958 --> 01:15:38.500
No. No, no, but he took all his pills.

01:15:38.583 --> 01:15:40.375
You guys have never been
outside before, right?

01:15:40.458 --> 01:15:41.291
[Dylan] No.

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:43.541
The low gravity could be affecting
his blood pressure.

01:15:43.625 --> 01:15:44.875
So give him another pill.

01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:46.750
I can't. They're back at the rover.

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:48.375
-Oh, no.
-Why didn't you say anything, Marcus?

01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:50.541
I didn't wanna ruin the trip.

01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:52.250
-Please. No, no, no.
-Okay. Come on.

01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:54.333
We need to get him back
to the rover, like, now.

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:55.500
Okay. Let's move.

01:15:55.583 --> 01:15:57.083
-Okay. Come on.

01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:08.083
[Dylan] Right behind you, Marcus.

01:16:08.666 --> 01:16:09.916
Come on, yeah. Push. Go.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.500
-[Marcus grunts]
-Take my hand.

01:16:14.625 --> 01:16:15.875

The meteor shower.

01:16:31.458 --> 01:16:32.458
Run!

01:16:32.541 --> 01:16:35.750
[all panting]

01:16:35.833 --> 01:16:37.750
Marcus, I've got you.

01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:48.166
-[Borney] Look out. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
-[Addison screams, grunts]

01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:49.333
[Borney] Come on. Ow!

01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:51.750
[Caleb] Okay, come on!

01:16:55.333 --> 01:16:56.750
[Addison screams]

01:16:58.458 --> 01:16:59.708
The rover's right there.

01:16:59.791 --> 01:17:02.083
-We need to make a run for it.
-We're never gonna make it.

01:17:02.166 --> 01:17:04.333
Yes, we will. Borney, look at me.

01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:06.458
-I can't.
-You want us to die out here?

01:17:06.541 --> 01:17:09.041
-Do you want Marcus to die?
-No.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.000
Then tell me you can do this.

01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:12.166
I can do it.

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:13.875
-[Caleb] Tell me you can do it!
-I can do it!

01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:15.291
Then run!

01:17:15.375 --> 01:17:17.708
[panting]

01:17:17.791 --> 01:17:19.458
[Addison] Go! I'll watch your backs.

01:17:25.375 --> 01:17:26.666
-[Dylan] Come on.
-[Caleb] Come on.

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:27.750
Let's go!

[grunting, panting]

01:17:29.791 --> 01:17:30.791
This way!

01:17:32.625 --> 01:17:33.958

-Hey, Borney. We're right behind you.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.875
[Borney] Come on, guys. We gotta go.

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:54.000
We gotta get Marcus inside the rover!

01:17:54.583 --> 01:17:56.000
Hey. Hey, where's Addison?

01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:56.958
[Marcus groans]

01:17:57.041 --> 01:17:59.625
Addison? Addison, where are you?

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:01.291
Addison!

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:05.791
-Over there!
-Addison, if you can hear us,

01:18:05.875 --> 01:18:08.000
-we're coming to get you, okay?
-Let's go.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:09.333
Okay.

01:18:09.416 --> 01:18:12.166
No! Dylan, don't come out here.

01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:16.166
Dylan, can you hear me? Then answer me!

01:18:17.541 --> 01:18:18.541
[Dylan] Hey!

01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:21.041
You having fun yet?

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:24.875
-Right. So, let's go.
-Get down!

01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:25.875
No!

01:18:26.458 --> 01:18:27.375
Dylan!

01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:29.208
[Borney grunts] We gotta--

01:18:29.291 --> 01:18:31.208
-But, Borney. The door--
-You're good.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:33.208
-[Marcus] The door. Wait.
-No. No, it's fine.

01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:35.291
It's fine. The door is closed.
You're good.

01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:38.000
[screams]

01:18:38.083 --> 01:18:38.916
Okay.

01:18:39.958 --> 01:18:40.958
Okay.

01:18:42.166 --> 01:18:43.666
[straining]

01:18:46.583 --> 01:18:48.375
I need to seal the cracks
before they spread.

01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:58.416
-But is it gonna hold?
-I don't know.

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:01.458
We can't stay here.
We need to get him up right now.

01:19:01.541 --> 01:19:02.583
-Okay.
-[Caleb] We have to go.

01:19:02.666 --> 01:19:04.083
[straining]

01:19:06.708 --> 01:19:10.125
Okay. [sighs] Everything's gonna be fine.

01:19:12.166 --> 01:19:13.333
Where is everybody?

01:19:20.458 --> 01:19:22.458
-Ready?
-Okay.

01:19:22.541 --> 01:19:23.541
Let's go.

01:19:25.166 --> 01:19:27.166
[grunting]

01:19:35.041 --> 01:19:37.500
[Caleb, Addison panting]

01:19:38.625 --> 01:19:39.625
[Caleb grunts]

01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:42.541
Oh, my God!

01:19:42.625 --> 01:19:44.625
[Caleb, Addison panting]

01:19:47.791 --> 01:19:49.125
I got you. Come on.

01:19:49.208 --> 01:19:50.375
-Let's get--
-Get him up.

01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:52.458
[straining]

01:19:54.166 --> 01:19:55.166
Let's go!

01:19:59.666 --> 01:20:02.250
[Caleb grunting]

01:20:05.083 --> 01:20:06.750
[banging on door]

01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:08.958
[Addison] Come on, Borney! Open up! Bor--

01:20:09.041 --> 01:20:10.458
-[grunts]
-[door whirs]

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:13.750
[Addison sighs, pants]

01:20:18.375 --> 01:20:19.458
What happened?

01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:26.166
-[Borney breathes shakily] Is he--
-He's fine.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:27.208
[rumbling]

01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:28.416
-He's fi--
-[Borney gasps]

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.583
He's fine. It's gonna--

01:20:34.125 --> 01:20:36.125
The rescue vehicles
are gonna be here soon.

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:39.041
No, they won't.

01:20:41.208 --> 01:20:42.291
The storm.

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:45.083
It means they're still on lockdown.

01:20:47.291 --> 01:20:48.625
They aren't coming.

01:20:48.708 --> 01:20:49.958
[crying] No. Don't say that.

01:20:51.125 --> 01:20:52.500
-[Caleb] I'm sorry.
-No, don't--

01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:55.041
Don't say that.

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:58.083
Okay, they're-- They'll be here.

01:20:59.333 --> 01:21:02.958
Right, it's gonna--
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:21:03.041 --> 01:21:06.125
-[rumbling]
-[Borney whimpering]

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.125
[Addison] They'll be here.

01:21:33.708 --> 01:21:34.708
[Marcus] Addison…

01:21:37.041 --> 01:21:39.041
what happens when we run out of oxygen?

01:21:42.333 --> 01:21:43.333
Well…

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:49.375
As the levels get lower…

01:21:51.583 --> 01:21:55.500
your suit will start
to recycle carbon dioxide.

01:21:56.791 --> 01:22:00.125
And you'll just start to get really tired.

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:06.291
Once you're asleep, the suit powers down.

01:22:07.541 --> 01:22:10.791
It will try to make the oxygen last
as long as possible.

01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:14.291
Then at some point, you'll just…

01:22:16.458 --> 01:22:17.541
slip away.

01:22:19.416 --> 01:22:20.500
It's peaceful.

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:22.583
Well…

01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:26.125
that sounds okay, I guess.

01:22:28.416 --> 01:22:29.416
[chuckles]

01:22:31.708 --> 01:22:34.125
[Addison, Marcus chuckling]

01:22:54.375 --> 01:22:55.375
[sniffles]

01:22:57.291 --> 01:22:59.291
[breathes shakily]

01:23:08.958 --> 01:23:10.000
Caleb?

01:23:10.083 --> 01:23:11.208
Huh?

01:23:11.291 --> 01:23:12.458
Hey, man. I'm right here.

01:23:13.375 --> 01:23:14.625
How long was I asleep?

01:23:15.625 --> 01:23:16.833
For a while.

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:18.791
A few hours at least.

01:23:21.583 --> 01:23:22.750
The rescue vehicles?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.083
They're on their way.

01:23:27.375 --> 01:23:29.208
Everything's gonna be just fine.

01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:34.750
You're a pretty bad liar. You know that?

01:23:34.833 --> 01:23:35.833
[chuckles]

01:23:39.708 --> 01:23:40.708
Are they--

01:23:44.166 --> 01:23:45.541
[Caleb] They're just sleeping.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.583
I never should have made you guys
come out here.

01:23:54.375 --> 01:23:55.541
[Dylan sighs]

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:58.666
You're an idiot.

01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:03.291
These were the best two days of my life.

01:24:04.083 --> 01:24:05.666
Same goes for them.

01:24:07.666 --> 01:24:09.666
We got to see the sky, man.

01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:11.666
All that blue.

01:24:15.041 --> 01:24:17.375
It's the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:25.250
So quit pissing and moaning
about how bad you feel.

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:26.500
[chuckles]

01:24:27.875 --> 01:24:30.875
[Dylan] Besides,
you didn't make us do anything.

01:24:33.458 --> 01:24:36.333
I would've dragged you out here
whether you wanted to go or not.

01:24:36.416 --> 01:24:37.791
[both chuckling]

01:24:37.875 --> 01:24:40.375
-That's probably true.
-You're damn right it's true.

01:24:44.083 --> 01:24:45.250
And don't laugh.

01:24:46.166 --> 01:24:47.583
You're wasting oxygen.

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:49.666
[both laughing]

01:25:04.083 --> 01:25:06.083
You'll always be my best friend.

01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:09.333
No matter what.

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:15.750
I know.

01:25:25.208 --> 01:25:28.958
[suits beeping, powering down]

01:25:37.625 --> 01:25:38.625
Dylan?

01:25:39.125 --> 01:25:40.625
[suit beeps, powers down]

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:41.708
Dylan?

01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:45.583
Dylan, what's going on? Dylan?

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:49.333
Dylan.

01:25:49.416 --> 01:25:52.250
[breathing heavily]

01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:57.666
[suit beeps, powers down]

01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:14.625
-[comm beeps]
-[rescue] Lunar rover?

01:26:14.708 --> 01:26:16.958
This is rescue vehicle two. Do you copy?

01:26:18.250 --> 01:26:20.500
We have visual contact
and are approaching.

01:26:20.583 --> 01:26:21.666
Please acknowledge.

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:34.750
Dylan?

01:26:35.666 --> 01:26:36.666
[sighs]

01:26:37.375 --> 01:26:38.375
Guys?

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:41.250
Huh? [grunts]

01:26:41.333 --> 01:26:43.000
[nurse] Easy. Not too fast.

01:26:43.083 --> 01:26:44.500
Your body's been through a lot.

01:26:44.583 --> 01:26:45.583
[sighs]

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:47.833
Is everyone okay?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.416
Everyone's fine.

01:26:51.666 --> 01:26:53.666
The trip was a complete success.

01:26:54.958 --> 01:26:56.041
Trip?

01:26:57.708 --> 01:26:58.708
[grunts]

01:26:58.791 --> 01:26:59.791
What trip?

01:27:00.625 --> 01:27:01.958
Aboard the transport.

01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:05.041
You're on Omega, Caleb.

01:27:06.791 --> 01:27:07.875
What?

01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:08.958
No.

01:27:09.708 --> 01:27:10.708
No.

01:27:10.791 --> 01:27:12.083
No! No! No! No!

01:27:12.166 --> 01:27:13.291
-I have to go.
-[nurse] You can't.

01:27:13.375 --> 01:27:15.000
-I have to go-- I can't--
-Hey. It's all right.

01:27:15.083 --> 01:27:18.333
I was just on the rover. I fell asleep.
I didn't get to say goodbye.

01:27:18.416 --> 01:27:21.416
[birds chirping]

01:27:34.041 --> 01:27:35.541
[nurse] It's difficult at first.

01:27:36.916 --> 01:27:38.583
You're going to need time to adjust.

01:27:40.583 --> 01:27:41.666
This may help.

01:27:43.666 --> 01:27:44.666
What is it?

01:27:45.208 --> 01:27:47.416
Messages from the Lunar colony.

01:27:48.166 --> 01:27:50.583
From the last 75 years while you slept.

01:27:57.083 --> 01:27:59.291
There's a foster family
you'll be staying with.

01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:01.791
They're coming by this afternoon.

01:28:01.875 --> 01:28:03.375
They're very excited to meet you.

01:28:20.708 --> 01:28:21.708
[sighs]

01:28:25.375 --> 01:28:26.375
[sighs]

01:28:35.583 --> 01:28:36.583
[device beeps]

01:28:38.666 --> 01:28:42.500
[Dylan] Hey, man. Uh, you're not gonna
hear this for a pretty long time,

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:44.583
which is really weird.

01:28:44.666 --> 01:28:47.125
Anyway, there's some folks here
who wanted to say hi.

01:28:47.208 --> 01:28:49.208
-[Addison] Hi, Caleb!
-[Borney] Uh, where do I talk?

01:28:49.291 --> 01:28:51.291
[Marcus] Uh,
just put your face near the microphone.

01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:54.375
[Borney] Oh, oh, oh.
There it is. Hi, Caleb!

01:28:54.458 --> 01:28:56.416
[Marcus] Uh, hi, Caleb.
I hope Omega's nice.

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:58.000
[Dylan] All right, guys. Come on, come on.

01:28:58.083 --> 01:28:59.083
We're on a clock here.

01:28:59.166 --> 01:29:01.750
Anyway, I wanted you to know
that everyone's okay

01:29:01.833 --> 01:29:04.166
so that you didn't worry when you woke up.

01:29:04.250 --> 01:29:07.041
-Addison talked to her dad and--
-[Addison] Actually, I yelled at him.

01:29:07.125 --> 01:29:08.208
[Dylan] Yeah, she did.

01:29:08.291 --> 01:29:10.708
He said that they'd let me use
the transmitter once a year.

01:29:10.791 --> 01:29:12.916
Apparently, that's way more than usual.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:16.750
So, you'll have plenty of catching up
to do when you wake up.

01:29:16.833 --> 01:29:20.291
And, listen, don't be sad. Okay?

01:29:20.375 --> 01:29:22.250
Things are gonna be okay.

01:29:22.333 --> 01:29:24.916
For you, for us, for everyone.

01:29:25.958 --> 01:29:26.875
I love you, man!

01:29:26.958 --> 01:29:28.041
[Addison] I love you too!

01:29:28.125 --> 01:29:29.375
[Dylan] Addison loves you too.

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:38.250
[device beeps]

01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:40.208
[Dylan] Hey, buddy.

01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:44.083
I can't believe it's been a year already.

01:29:44.166 --> 01:29:45.416
[chuckles]

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.833
I don't know what you said
to Addison before you left,

01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:49.750
but the girl won't leave me alone.

01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:53.583
All year she's been showing up
with sandwiches.

01:29:54.333 --> 01:29:56.083
I guess it's not so bad though.

01:29:57.416 --> 01:30:00.416
Hey. Everybody misses you, man.

01:30:01.166 --> 01:30:02.750
We talk about you all the time.

01:30:09.208 --> 01:30:10.208
[sighs]

01:30:16.458 --> 01:30:17.416
[device beeps]

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.666
[Dylan]
It's hard to believe it's been so long.

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:22.375
It feels like just yesterday
we were out there planning our trip.

01:30:22.458 --> 01:30:23.708
Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:26.083
[Dylan] And now here I am working
down in the mines.

01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:29.791
At least all that wonderful schooling
is paying off.

01:30:29.875 --> 01:30:30.708
Yeah.

01:30:31.333 --> 01:30:32.750
[Dylan] It's not so bad though.

01:30:33.458 --> 01:30:35.333
Borney and I are on the same crew.

01:30:35.416 --> 01:30:38.416
And Marcus is trying to get his foreman
to let him rotate over.

01:30:39.166 --> 01:30:42.166
-Addison keeps staging these protests…
-This way.

01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:44.583
…demanding changes in the contracts.

01:30:47.708 --> 01:30:48.875
The funny thing is,

01:30:49.791 --> 01:30:51.791
we were just walking
down the hall one day…

01:30:52.458 --> 01:30:54.875
[laughing] …and she held my hand.

01:30:57.041 --> 01:31:00.625
And then we just--
Neither one of us let go.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.416
Caleb! She did it!

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.166
She actually did it!

01:31:12.250 --> 01:31:15.583
She finally got them to close
all the loopholes in the contract.

01:31:15.666 --> 01:31:19.666
No more passing down unfinished hours
from one generation to the next.

01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:22.500
And now she's got Borney
helping her form a commission

01:31:22.583 --> 01:31:25.208
to restart all those
old construction projects.

01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:28.583
So Borney wears a suit and tie now.

01:31:28.666 --> 01:31:31.916
Yeah, but we still give him a hard time
about the space ghosts though.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
[device beeps]

01:31:33.083 --> 01:31:36.666
[adult Dylan] I know I'm early this year,
but I couldn't wait.

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:39.000
I asked Addison to marry me.

01:31:39.083 --> 01:31:40.458
She said yes!

01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:44.250
Man, I think back to that day
she and I met in the cafeteria.

01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:47.833
We were all so nervous
about bringing the Earth girl along.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.041
Guess what.

01:31:51.583 --> 01:31:53.666
Marcus started a baseball league.

01:31:54.250 --> 01:31:57.250
I still don't get the game,
but kids here seem to like it.

01:31:57.916 --> 01:32:01.041
Now he's got a whole team
bugging him about his pills.

01:32:01.125 --> 01:32:03.541
We're just glad the big guy is still here.

01:32:05.083 --> 01:32:06.833
Addison's pregnant.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:08.750
I'm gonna be a dad.

01:32:08.833 --> 01:32:10.666
-[passerby] Hi.
-[adult Dylan] Can you believe that?

01:32:11.375 --> 01:32:13.250
-[Caleb] Where can I find it?
-Follow that path…

01:32:13.333 --> 01:32:16.041
[adult Dylan] I look around now
at everything that's changed,

01:32:16.125 --> 01:32:18.291
the lives, the homes we built.

01:32:19.208 --> 01:32:20.625
It's because of you.

01:32:21.375 --> 01:32:25.666
You brought us out of that dome
and showed us what this place could be.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.416
That's the world we made.

01:32:30.333 --> 01:32:31.666
It's funny.

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:34.375
The more that time goes by,

01:32:34.458 --> 01:32:38.166
the more I realize just how much
that trip really meant.

01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:42.041
There are these moments
that only happen once.

01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:45.083
Those are the ones you hold on to.

01:32:45.166 --> 01:32:47.166
They become the stories that you tell.

01:32:48.166 --> 01:32:51.416
That way you never really have
to say goodbye.

01:32:56.041 --> 01:33:00.958
[elderly Dylan] It's so strange to think
of you out there still frozen in time.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.041
You have no idea how much joy
it's brought us all these years

01:33:06.125 --> 01:33:11.208
to imagine the incredible things
you'll do, all the adventures you'll have.

01:33:12.333 --> 01:33:17.125
Hey, I'm taking my grandkids out
to the crater next week.

01:33:17.208 --> 01:33:18.708
Can you imagine that?

01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:21.833
We have good lives here, Caleb.

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:25.000
We became the masters of our own fate.

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:27.500
And now, my friend,

01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:30.291
it's time for you
to become the master of yours.

01:33:30.375 --> 01:33:31.375
[sighs]

01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:34.875
[device beeps]

01:33:38.416 --> 01:33:40.416
[birds chirping]

01:33:47.250 --> 01:33:48.666
[sighs]

01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:59.750
Hi.

01:34:01.041 --> 01:34:02.041
Hello.

01:34:02.625 --> 01:34:04.250
I was told I could find you here.

01:34:07.666 --> 01:34:10.083
I think this belongs to you.

01:34:12.208 --> 01:34:13.541
[gasps]

01:34:13.625 --> 01:34:15.250
Your sister was a friend of mine.

01:34:17.583 --> 01:34:20.416
Wait a second. Are you Caleb?

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:24.875
My sister talked about you a lot
on my transmitter.

01:34:25.541 --> 01:34:28.708
I think she must have snuck this
into my bag before I left.

01:34:29.916 --> 01:34:31.583
She'd probably want you to have it.

01:34:32.541 --> 01:34:33.625
[chuckles]

01:34:38.250 --> 01:34:40.000
I never thought I'd see this again.

01:34:42.958 --> 01:34:45.458
I think you and I are gonna have
a lot to talk about.

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:47.500
[chuckles]

01:34:48.083 --> 01:34:49.083
[sighs]

01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:53.666
Did you guys really steal a rover
and go across the moon?

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:54.750
Sure did.

01:34:56.291 --> 01:34:58.750
Addison said you almost blew
one of your friends into space.

01:34:58.833 --> 01:35:01.541
[chuckles] We didn't blow him into space.

01:35:01.625 --> 01:35:03.375
We were just playing launch-off.

01:35:03.458 --> 01:35:05.083
-What's launch-off?
-It's a game.

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.541
See what you had to do is,
you get an oxygen tank,

01:35:07.625 --> 01:35:10.875
turn it upside down, and you hold it
in front of you as tight as you can,

01:35:10.958 --> 01:35:12.083
like this.

01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:14.875
Why do you turn it upside down?

01:35:14.958 --> 01:35:16.625
That's where you get the propulsion.

01:35:17.166 --> 01:35:19.250
This game seems like a terrible idea.

01:35:21.041 --> 01:35:23.541
Yeah. Your sister thought so too.

01:35:25.375 --> 01:35:27.500
You know,
I'm gonna need someone to show me around.

01:35:28.125 --> 01:35:29.375
You think you're up for it?

01:35:30.625 --> 01:35:32.375
Really? Me?

01:35:33.791 --> 01:35:35.208
What are you doing tomorrow?

01:35:35.291 --> 01:35:37.791
[Caleb] Well,
I guess we're going on an adventure.
