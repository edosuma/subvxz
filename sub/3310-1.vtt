06:08.588 --> 06:11.389

quiet while they chop it all down.

06:11.489 --> 06:14.058
It isn't nice to fool Mother Nature.

06:14.158 --> 06:18.897

trees that are a hundred years old.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.056
So, this is the place you
were telling me about?

06:44.156 --> 06:47.292
Almost. A little further down.
But might as well be the same thing.

06:47.392 --> 06:49.291
It's all the same forest.

We used to camp here every summer.

brownie points with your folks...

- Yeah. This will be great.

Oh, is it intimidating that your
girlfriend is used to the outdoors?

What? What? No. No, I'm just saying...

07:31.302 --> 07:33.972
at least I know you'll be
all right if I wasn't here.

- Just enough. You'll thank me later.

Is it gonna be safe here?

in the woods, right?

- I know.

11:11.155 --> 11:13.291

11:13.391 --> 11:16.728
Sort of looks familiar,
but it feels different.

- Feels different.
- Mm-hmm.

11:18.930 --> 11:20.462
Feels different, how?

you never said anything about this.

11:41.918 --> 11:45.851
Oh, it's just a little safety precaution.
I called the district ranger

11:45.951 --> 11:50.394
and he said that the tree cutting has been
displacing animals from the deeper areas.

11:50.494 --> 11:53.164
- SEAN: Uh, does it work?
- Yeah, it works.

11:53.264 --> 11:55.166
Can of that stuff will send
a grizzly bear running.

11:55.266 --> 11:57.235
- Oh, so you've used it.
- Yes...

11:57.335 --> 11:59.904
Uh, no, I haven't used it,
but I know how to use it.

Well, shit, we gotta test this out.

hear about the Ohio Howl?

- The Ohio what?
- Howl... like at the moon.

- Like, "Whoo!"
- Sean, shut the hell up.

word at the ranger's office,

gonna send someone as soon as possible.

- Here.

Also I texted your parents, and I...

26:19.262 --> 26:22.132
was vague, but they said
they're sending help.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.167

can send someone to help.

knows more about this place than we do.

- How else can you explain it?
- Look at me. I know it's hard for you.

31:20.897 --> 31:22.877
Okay. But you can't keep doing this.
You're overthinking.

31:22.977 --> 31:25.456
No, I'm not.
I'm being completely rational.

31:25.556 --> 31:28.092
- You're not even listening to me.
- Look at me. It's just an animal.

31:29.705 --> 31:31.108
That's it.

31:31.208 --> 31:35.445
And what's happening in here to us
is happening because it just is.

31:35.545 --> 31:38.381
Figuring out why that is happening,
it doesn't help us.

31:38.481 --> 31:41.882
But figuring out how to
get out of here, that does.

31:43.752 --> 31:45.088
Come here.

31:45.826 --> 31:48.191
You're the smartest girl that I know.

31:48.791 --> 31:50.293
You're a genius.

31:51.093 --> 31:53.897
So don't let that beautiful brain
of yours spiral out of control

31:53.997 --> 31:56.997
because you can't figure
out something, okay?

31:58.700 --> 32:00.904

It'll come back, and we won't have
enough to hold it off. Not again.

- We have nothing.

We gotta get out of this damn house.

We can pick the most fortified room,

38:12.609 --> 38:15.678
pool any of the stronger
resources around the house...

38:15.778 --> 38:17.980
and focus on the one controllable space.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.350
Rather than spread out, focus in.

38:20.850 --> 38:23.720
One room, one barricade. No surprises.

38:23.820 --> 38:25.321
Sounds good to me.

- Have you heard anything? Is it Scott?
- SEAN: Sean.

38:28.491 --> 38:33.363
No. They... It's dead. But I'm confident.
They said they were coming, so...

38:33.463 --> 38:36.099
- 911 said they're sending someone, so...
- SEAN: Any minute, right?

38:36.199 --> 38:38.032

38:39.835 --> 38:41.936
You've been awfully quiet, Doug.

38:43.372 --> 38:45.342
I'm just listening.

38:45.442 --> 38:48.743
Yeah? Then what's so fucking funny?

38:50.612 --> 38:52.390
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

38:59.054 --> 39:02.826
Holing up in a room is great.
There's only two problems with that.

39:02.926 --> 39:05.995
First, that thing bashes through
everything we put in front of it.

39:06.095 --> 39:08.932
Dressers and old wood scraps
are not long-term solutions.

39:09.032 --> 39:11.501
They're just cheap Band-Aids
slowing the inevitable.

39:11.601 --> 39:13.035
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

39:13.435 --> 39:18.408
How long have you been here, sweetheart?
You think cramming in a room makes us safe?

39:18.508 --> 39:21.978
I think it makes us sardines.
And I'm sorry, Vick. Help isn't coming.

39:22.078 --> 39:24.714
That's problem number two,
and you've known that for a while.

39:24.814 --> 39:26.749
All right, dude, that's bullshit.
They said they traced my call...

39:26.849 --> 39:28.651
To the nearest cell tower, right?

39:28.751 --> 39:31.955
Isn't that what they told you?
'Cause they told me the same thing.

39:32.355 --> 39:34.657
But I'm beginning to think
that must not be very close.

39:35.557 --> 39:37.741
Okay, but her parents,
they were gonna call...

39:37.841 --> 39:41.431
- They know people in the area.
- Oh, they know people. (CHUCKLES)

39:41.531 --> 39:44.801
People that will... will answer the
phone in the middle of the night,

39:44.901 --> 39:46.970
climb out of bed and hike
into the nowhere woods?

39:47.070 --> 39:49.339
Wow. Your parents must have some
really close friends out here.

39:49.439 --> 39:51.574
You don't need to be
an asshole, asshole.

39:51.674 --> 39:56.379
Tell me something. Do these magical friends
know something that the local police don't?

39:56.479 --> 40:00.117
Is there a secret I'm missing?
'Cause our doorbell sure hasn't been ringing.

40:00.217 --> 40:03.417
So, what's your plan, handsome?

40:04.786 --> 40:06.520
We run for it.

40:07.589 --> 40:09.692
- For where?
- The road.

40:09.792 --> 40:13.696
If anyone is actually looking for us,
we'll be easier to find there.

40:13.796 --> 40:16.799
If not, help will be easier
for us to find there, not here.

40:16.899 --> 40:19.736
- SEAN: Well, I think that's fucking crazy.
- It's not as crazy as you think.

40:19.836 --> 40:22.013
News flash: last time we did that,
it didn't end up so well.

40:22.113 --> 40:24.908
Oh, I beg to differ.
You're still alive, aren't you?

40:25.008 --> 40:29.012
Things ended great for you.
They didn't end well for someone else.

40:30.012 --> 40:32.448
You know you're talking
about my brother, right?

40:32.548 --> 40:34.514
And my wife.

40:41.589 --> 40:45.459
- If we run, it doesn't matter how fast...
- Get to the point.

40:49.998 --> 40:54.101
All we have to do is give
it something to chew on.

40:54.806 --> 40:58.374
- Like what?
- Stop. We're not running.

40:58.474 --> 41:01.709
She's injured. We're fatigued.
It's not an option.

41:05.747 --> 41:07.147
MATT: Doug's right.

41:10.652 --> 41:13.389
Carl, you're right too.

41:13.489 --> 41:16.292
Not all of us can go,
but some of us can.

41:16.392 --> 41:18.928
Or, uh, one of us.

41:19.624 --> 41:22.231
- Matt.
- I can outrun this thing.

41:22.788 --> 41:25.968
If I just get to the highway,
I can bring back help.

41:26.068 --> 41:27.814
I can.

has the brains of the bunch.

41:43.885 --> 41:45.239
What the hell are you doing?

41:45.339 --> 41:47.760
- I'm getting us out of here.
- You're not faster than that thing.

41:47.860 --> 41:50.462
- I don't want you going out there.
- Babe. (SIGHS)

41:51.260 --> 41:53.996
I know what you're thinking,
but this is different. Okay?

41:54.096 --> 41:56.532
We have seen that thing. We've seen
how big it is and how strong it is,

41:56.632 --> 41:58.934
- and that means it's got to be slow.
- You're assuming that.

41:59.034 --> 42:03.740
I'm not. Listen to me. If we can create
a diversion or distract it somehow,

42:03.840 --> 42:06.947
I'll have a head start, and that
thing won't stand a chance. Okay?

42:07.047 --> 42:09.679
I will haul ass through those woods,
and I will find help.

42:09.779 --> 42:12.648
I will not stop until I do. Okay?

42:12.748 --> 42:14.948

those peaks, remember?

42:17.418 --> 42:20.857
Look, you know, we got these, all right?

42:21.257 --> 42:26.028
I don't know what the range is on them,
but I'm gonna call you.

42:26.128 --> 42:30.697
I'm gonna call you until you answer
so that you can guide me back.

42:32.801 --> 42:35.769
You're the most important thing to me.
I got to get you out of here.

42:38.673 --> 42:41.175
- Who'll distract it?
- CARL: I will.

42:44.379 --> 42:48.015
I've looked down that thing's throat too
many times. I'm not afraid of it anymore.

42:49.284 --> 42:52.219
Just wanna get everyone home safe.

51:28.670 --> 51:31.707
You're gonna have to keep it down.
That thing will hear you, remember?

51:31.807 --> 51:34.743
You're kidding me with this, right?
It's a joke.

51:34.843 --> 51:36.778
What do you think you're doing?

51:36.878 --> 51:39.212
Protecting the others from monsters.

51:41.649 --> 51:44.720
(CHUCKLES) Really funny, Carl.

51:44.820 --> 51:48.257
Call me what you want, but I did
what was necessary to survive.

51:48.357 --> 51:50.773
I was willing to make the tough call.

You can't save everyone, Carl.

You'll... You'll try, but we'll all die.

You know, at least I can cope with the reality.

52:37.838 --> 52:39.908
I can't stop.

If I do, I'll think about what
that thing might have done to him.

52:44.146 --> 52:47.213
Or relive watching what it did to Jeff.

52:48.582 --> 52:52.966

52:53.322 --> 52:55.988
I can imagine what I'm gonna do to it.

I'm gonna kill that thing, Mandy.

I'm gonna kill it.

"What was the last song I listened to
on my iPod?" Like, Taylor Swift. Really.

Remember junior year... when I
was breaking out, like, horrible.

55:19.501 --> 55:23.905
Remember I was, like, using a lot of
foundation? Going through a period.

I stole, like,
99% of that from the MAC store.

die with, you know.

so let's just drop it, okay?

to leap out of there earlier.

- Stop!

59:21.775 --> 59:23.812
Here are your choices.

59:23.912 --> 59:26.948
You can come with me
or you can stay here.

to do, but I can't very well go down there

if I have to worry about you.

He's dying, hon.

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:02.924
I'm sorry to say it. I truly am.
But someone has to.

01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:07.396
- Sporto's not gonna last much longer.
- We can still save him.

01:04:07.996 --> 01:04:10.930
I don't think you can be
so sure about that.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:15.401
But he can still save us.

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:21.342
He can be... the diversion we need.

01:04:21.642 --> 01:04:25.013
He can distract that thing
while we run for it.

01:04:25.513 --> 01:04:28.347
You mean give it something to chew on?

01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:33.021
I was trying not to say it like that.

his life earlier for you guys.

Don't you see it? Now he can.

01:04:41.896 --> 01:04:43.732
- (MATT SHUDDERING)
- As bait?

01:04:43.832 --> 01:04:46.832
- He's already dead.
- Not yet.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:53.475
Carl was the most capable of all of us.

01:04:53.575 --> 01:04:57.676
If that thing got to him,
how can we hope to do any better?

01:04:58.745 --> 01:05:01.282
Matt, dead, is our chance.

01:05:01.382 --> 01:05:05.420
I'm not saying it's an easy
pill to swallow. It's just fact.

If anybody has a better idea,
believe me, I'm all ears.

01:05:12.793 --> 01:05:15.864
We know if we open that door,
that thing's coming in.

01:05:16.464 --> 01:05:17.899
So let's trap it.

and we get the hell out of here.

01:05:21.002 --> 01:05:25.173
The same barricades that kept that thing
out will be the same ones that keep it in.

01:05:25.273 --> 01:05:26.887
The kerosene we found in
the cellar should be enough

01:05:26.987 --> 01:05:29.055
so we all can make a run for safety.

01:05:29.644 --> 01:05:32.380
And we don't need to worry
about needing any bait.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.082
Being incinerated should
be distraction enough.

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:36.415

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.888

01:05:41.995 --> 01:05:44.259
Get us the hell out of here.

01:05:44.959 --> 01:05:48.429
Whatever we're gonna do, we have to do
it now because he's not looking good.

01:05:48.529 --> 01:05:50.064
- (SHUDDERING)
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:05:50.164 --> 01:05:53.800
I'll help you carry him.
His only chance is if we hurry.

01:05:55.435 --> 01:05:57.605
So what do we do first?

01:05:57.805 --> 01:05:59.545
(SHUDDERING)

01:06:08.248 --> 01:06:09.449

01:06:15.588 --> 01:06:16.891
I...

01:06:18.714 --> 01:06:20.800

Oh, my god!

01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:47.522
Now, can we stop acting like
children and think like adults?

01:06:47.622 --> 01:06:51.760
- Douglas, goddamn you!
- It was so simple! He was dead!

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:55.596
- You killed him!
- I didn't kill anyone, sweetheart.

01:06:55.696 --> 01:06:58.397
I sped up a clock
that was already ticking.

01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:03.671
All you had to do was bring
this sack of meat outside...

01:07:03.771 --> 01:07:05.840
and let that thing in while we ran!

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:10.011
But no, that was too damn hard
for any of you to fucking grasp!

01:07:10.111 --> 01:07:12.146
So I'll just have to do it myself!

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:15.450
- You're a lunatic!
- I'm a survivor!

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:17.852
I'm not afraid to do
what needs to be done,

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:20.052
which is more than can
be said about any of you.

01:07:21.555 --> 01:07:23.525
You're all welcome to join me.

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:27.428
And I'm not gonna sit around here
and wait for you guys to discuss it.

01:07:27.528 --> 01:07:30.228
So, what's it gonna be?

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.204
Ah, I guess it's true
what they say. You...
