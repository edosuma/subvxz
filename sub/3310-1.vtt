- Carl, let me go.

- (ANIMAL SCREECHES)
- Barbara!

04:15.339 --> 04:18.711
- It's been way too long.
- Yeah, it has.

04:19.511 --> 04:21.813
Alissa, you remember
where that turnoff is?

04:21.913 --> 04:24.380
One or two miles past
the Holland Creek sign.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.321
Does he even know where he's going?

04:30.421 --> 04:33.389
No. I do.

05:07.258 --> 05:09.994
- (SHOUTS) Is this it?
- Holy shit. Sean.

05:10.094 --> 05:11.730
Almost, man.
This is the road, but we still got...

05:11.830 --> 05:13.729
- (SHOUTS) Huh?
- Almost!

05:15.181 --> 05:17.185
- I'm sorry, you were saying?
- Almost. Oh, my God.

05:17.285 --> 05:19.571
- It's like talking to a deaf person.
- We're close.

05:19.671 --> 05:23.639
You know, it's attitudes like that
that make me wear these.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.212
WOMAN: It's your idea.

05:27.312 --> 05:30.115
- SEAN: (SHOUTING) This is really beautiful!
- WOMAN: Oh, my God.

05:30.415 --> 05:32.017
- SEAN: Gorgeous!
- WOMAN: Shut up!

05:32.117 --> 05:33.883
DRIVER: Keep those out.

05:40.157 --> 05:42.127
Are you serious?

05:42.327 --> 05:44.093
- SEAN: What is this?
- DRIVER: It's a roadblock.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.768
(SIGHS) Aw, shit.

05:54.838 --> 05:56.305
WOMAN: He's so mad.

06:02.513 --> 06:03.782
(EXHALES)

06:04.282 --> 06:06.418
- Why is it closed?
- DRIVER: I don't know.

06:06.518 --> 06:08.488
What's forest regeneration?

06:08.588 --> 06:11.389
It's bullshit. It's a lie to keep people
quiet while they chop it all down.

06:11.489 --> 06:14.058
It isn't nice to fool Mother Nature.

06:14.158 --> 06:18.897
No, it is not. They're chopping down
trees that are a hundred years old.

06:18.997 --> 06:21.733
No. Someone's a little pissed.

06:21.833 --> 06:25.570
- I am pissed. Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

06:25.670 --> 06:28.440
That's why we came...
to enjoy what's here before it's gone.

06:28.540 --> 06:30.142
Yeah.

06:30.442 --> 06:34.012
Guys, guys, guys. Don't...
Don't bring any of that on the trail.

06:34.112 --> 06:36.014
- Oh, it's coming. Yeah, it's coming.
- Shut up, Sean.

06:36.114 --> 06:39.384
You're gonna get off my car.
Actually, can we get around this thing?

06:39.484 --> 06:41.520
SEAN: Yeah. Just knock it down.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.056
So, this is the place you
were telling me about?

06:44.156 --> 06:47.292
Almost. A little further down.
But might as well be the same thing.

06:47.392 --> 06:49.291
It's all the same forest.

06:50.427 --> 06:53.531
We used to camp here every summer.

06:53.631 --> 06:55.900
It was like our one family tradition.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.770
Think this is gonna score me some
brownie points with your folks...

06:58.870 --> 07:01.673
or, uh, your brother?

07:02.569 --> 07:03.908
I wouldn't count on it.

07:04.008 --> 07:06.110
All right, what do you think?

07:06.210 --> 07:08.179
- Close enough?
- Yeah. This will be great.

07:08.279 --> 07:09.347
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:09.447 --> 07:11.948
All right. Let's suit up.

07:14.217 --> 07:16.052
(SCOFFS)

07:22.059 --> 07:24.496
This ain't right.
I'm supposed to be fixing your backpack.

07:24.596 --> 07:28.166
Oh, is it intimidating that your
girlfriend is used to the outdoors?

07:28.266 --> 07:31.202
What? What? No. No, I'm just saying...

07:31.302 --> 07:33.972
at least I know you'll be
all right if I wasn't here.

07:34.072 --> 07:35.905
Yeah, I'd be okay.

07:38.108 --> 07:41.413
- Hey.
- Sorry, man. I'm just trying to hurry.

07:42.213 --> 07:46.115
- How much shit you put in there?
- Just enough. You'll thank me later.

07:49.486 --> 07:52.023
What about the rest of the stuff?
Is it gonna be safe here?

07:52.323 --> 07:53.892
Yeah.

07:53.992 --> 07:56.258
Better than losing it
in the woods, right?

07:57.961 --> 07:59.998
Are you sure?

08:00.498 --> 08:04.133
I'm sure. Let's go.
We're burning daylight.

08:05.602 --> 08:09.007
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

08:09.307 --> 08:11.910
At least you're not the drill
sergeant your brother is.

08:12.010 --> 08:14.812
That's the "step" part. His dad.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.048
- DRIVER: I heard that.
- Ooh!

08:17.148 --> 08:18.683
I hear everything.

08:18.783 --> 08:20.184
â™ª (EARBUDS: DANCE)

08:20.284 --> 08:23.221
- Hey. You're not bringing that.
- What?

08:23.321 --> 08:25.857
Put it in the car.
This is our date with Mother Nature.

08:25.957 --> 08:28.424
What? It's mood music.
You usually like it.

08:29.626 --> 08:31.160
What are we waiting for?

08:33.864 --> 08:36.067
- You know it's a hike, right?
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

08:36.167 --> 08:38.870
- We have to look good.
- You look fine. Let's go.

08:38.970 --> 08:42.317
Alissa, let me explain something to you.
You are a natural beauty, okay?

08:42.417 --> 08:46.611
It's a gift. Girls like me,
we gotta take what we got and work it.

08:46.711 --> 08:48.613
Besides, I have a reputation to uphold.

08:48.713 --> 08:50.448
- It's just us.
- Oh, Liss.

08:50.548 --> 08:54.183
You know better than that.
It's never just us.

08:54.785 --> 08:58.390
Group, get together. All right,
guys, get together. Get closer.

08:58.490 --> 08:59.991
You're ready? One.

09:00.291 --> 09:01.760
Two. Everyone say "fifth wheel."

09:01.860 --> 09:03.461
- Fifth wheel!
- (CLICKS)

09:04.561 --> 09:08.640
- Oh, you're so cute when you're pathetic.
- You're not cute in that photo.

09:09.701 --> 09:12.502
- (CLICKS)
- Oh, my God. Is that what my hair looks like?

09:18.241 --> 09:19.875
(LAUGHS)

09:21.144 --> 09:22.778
What?

09:25.382 --> 09:27.151
Am I that obvious?

09:27.251 --> 09:32.054
Relax. Enjoy it. These woods won't
even be here in the next few years.

09:33.356 --> 09:35.624
I will if you give me a kiss.

09:36.927 --> 09:38.327
That a girl.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.439
- MAN: I'm gonna stop.
- ALISSA: For what?

10:05.455 --> 10:08.259
- Dare me?
- No!

10:08.359 --> 10:10.028
Don't do it.

10:10.128 --> 10:11.861
You dare me?

10:15.832 --> 10:19.508
SEAN: So this is pretty much it, huh?
We just keep walking and then...

10:19.608 --> 10:21.606
turn around and walk back?

10:21.706 --> 10:24.340
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

10:25.809 --> 10:28.346
I'm taking you guys to this
amazing cave near the creek.

10:28.446 --> 10:30.582
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:30.682 --> 10:33.451
Alissa and I used to go swimming
there all the time when we were kids.

10:33.551 --> 10:36.621
Swimming? You never said anything
about bringing a bathing suit.

10:36.721 --> 10:39.791
- Did I forget to tell you about the bathing suit?
- You did.

10:39.891 --> 10:42.998
- What were you thinking?
- You'll be fine without it.

10:44.829 --> 10:48.232
Does it ever get awkward seeing your
best friend kiss your brother like that?

10:48.332 --> 10:50.969
It was inevitable. But yes.

10:51.469 --> 10:53.571
So how long has it been for you?

10:53.671 --> 10:56.875
It's been a while now...
like six or seven years.

10:56.975 --> 10:59.644
- Really?
- We stopped coming after we moved.

10:59.744 --> 11:02.680
The trip got too long and we got busy.

11:02.780 --> 11:05.501
Yeah, it's a... it's a long-ass drive.

11:05.601 --> 11:08.386
- Yeah.
- But it's worth it though.

11:08.486 --> 11:11.055
- It's gorgeous out here.
- I know.

11:11.155 --> 11:13.291
Does it look familiar at all to you?

11:13.391 --> 11:16.728
Sort of looks familiar,
but it feels different.

11:16.828 --> 11:18.830
- Feels different.
- Mm-hmm.

11:18.930 --> 11:20.462
Feels different, how?

11:21.998 --> 11:24.466
- I don't know.
- This different?

11:35.912 --> 11:37.749
(CHATTERING)

11:37.949 --> 11:40.182
SEAN: Hey, Jeff,
you never said anything about this.

11:41.918 --> 11:45.851
Oh, it's just a little safety precaution.
I called the district ranger

11:45.951 --> 11:50.394
and he said that the tree cutting has been
displacing animals from the deeper areas.

11:50.494 --> 11:53.164
- SEAN: Uh, does it work?
- Yeah, it works.

11:53.264 --> 11:55.166
Can of that stuff will send
a grizzly bear running.

11:55.266 --> 11:57.235
- Oh, so you've used it.
- Yes...

11:57.335 --> 11:59.904
Uh, no, I haven't used it,
but I know how to use it.

12:00.004 --> 12:02.473
So if a giant bear comes
out of the woods right now,

12:02.573 --> 12:05.009
and it's like... (GROWLING)
"I'm going to kill you, Jeff"...

12:05.109 --> 12:07.545
- JEFF: They don't talk.
- You're gonna be like, "Aah!"

12:07.645 --> 12:10.648
- And... And you're not worried?
- Nope. Not worried at all.

12:10.748 --> 12:12.817
Well, shit, we gotta test this out.

12:13.517 --> 12:15.842
- Oh, be careful. Be careful.
- Okay, okay. Careful.

12:15.942 --> 12:18.322
All right, fifty dollars to whoever
lets me spray them in the face.

12:18.422 --> 12:21.359
- Give it to me.
- Fifty dollars for bear mace in the face.

12:21.459 --> 12:23.161
- Going once.
- WOMAN: You're an idiot.

12:23.261 --> 12:25.530
SEAN: All right, you're right.
I am an idiot. A hundred dollars.

12:25.630 --> 12:27.899
A hundred dollars for whoever
lets me spray them in the face.

12:27.999 --> 12:31.069
- Okay, a man after my own cash. I like it.
- ALISSA: No, you're not.

12:31.169 --> 12:34.272
- SEAN: Yes, he is.
- MAN: It's a hundred bucks. Let's do it.

12:34.372 --> 12:36.240
JEFF: Let him do it. Let him do it.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.375
- It'll be fine.
- (FLIES BUZZING)

12:44.381 --> 12:47.149
JEFF: Good job. Good job, guys.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.718
Almost there.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.907
- ALISSA: Jeff?
- Yeah?

12:53.007 --> 12:55.560
Creek's right up here. Once we get there,
we're gonna follow it to the falls.

12:55.660 --> 12:57.562
- There's not enough time.
- We have time. We're almost there.

12:57.662 --> 13:01.080
- We still have to make it back.
- I know we... I know. We're gonna be fine.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.901
Not if the sun goes down,
which it's about to do now.

13:04.001 --> 13:05.436
Hey.

13:05.536 --> 13:08.303
(PANTING) Go ahead, brother.

13:09.906 --> 13:14.245
We've been out much deeper,
much later than this with Dad, right?

13:14.745 --> 13:16.178
Right?

13:16.278 --> 13:18.416
- Yeah, but...
- Yes, we have.

13:18.516 --> 13:22.384
We're gonna be fine.
We got this. I promise.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.257
Hey. We got this.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.337
ALISSA:
We don't know. We need to go home.

13:39.437 --> 13:43.341
- Because you're not listening to me, Jeff.
- You're not trusting me.

13:43.441 --> 13:45.877
You're being selfish.
You're being selfish.

13:45.977 --> 13:47.912
We tried. It's been fun.
We'll come back another time.

13:48.012 --> 13:50.031
That's what I'm saying to you.
There's not gonna be another time.

13:50.131 --> 13:52.016
- ALISSA: You don't know that.
- This is it! I do know that!

13:52.116 --> 13:53.952
They do this all the time?

13:54.052 --> 13:57.755
Well, they both love hiking,
and they're both stubborn as hell.

13:58.255 --> 14:01.492
- Any idea how long it'll last?
- A long time.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.659
(ALISSA, JEFF CONTINUE ARGUING)

14:06.930 --> 14:09.000
All right, nature calls.
I'll be right back.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.369
JEFF: We'll go back right now.

14:11.469 --> 14:14.472
Why did we come?
Why did we come to stand here?

14:14.572 --> 14:16.872
- â™ª (EARBUDS, FAINT)
- But it's Taylor Swift.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.548
(GRUNTS)

15:27.978 --> 15:30.248
Aah! What the fuck is that?

15:30.848 --> 15:33.584
It's a backpack.
I found it when I was taking a leak.

15:33.684 --> 15:37.021
- Did you wash your hands?
- Yeah. With the bar of soap that I found.

15:37.121 --> 15:38.821
Relax for a second.

15:40.557 --> 15:42.794
I wonder whose this is.

15:43.094 --> 15:45.696
What are the marines
doing out in the boondocks?

15:45.796 --> 15:47.565
ALISSA: We're going back.

15:48.871 --> 15:50.832
They better wrap this shit up,
'cause there's no goddamn way

15:50.932 --> 15:52.832
I'm walking back in the dark.

15:53.671 --> 15:55.688
(OWL HOOTING)

15:56.607 --> 16:00.277
If we keep along this direction, we'll be
able to cut the curve and make better time.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.146
Whatever you say, fearless leader.

16:02.246 --> 16:04.782
- WOMAN: Please don't. Please don't.
- Can someone Uber us a cab?

16:04.882 --> 16:06.217
- Mandy, talk to me.
- What?

16:06.317 --> 16:08.653
- Hey, stop it. Stop.
- What? What, Jeff. What?

16:08.753 --> 16:10.888
I'm sorry. Okay? I made a mistake.

16:10.988 --> 16:13.124
- MANDY: You didn't pack like it was a mistake.
- Guys, guys, guys, guys.

16:13.224 --> 16:14.926
- JEFF: It was a mistake.
- Help me understand, Jeff.

16:15.026 --> 16:16.694
- What exactly are you sorry for?
- I'm sorry...

16:16.794 --> 16:18.393
- For being a deliberate asshole?
- Come on.

16:18.493 --> 16:20.364
For failing to fill everyone
in on what we're doing?

16:20.464 --> 16:22.833
No, I'm sorry that
you are upset with me.

16:22.933 --> 16:24.869
Okay? I thought that this was
gonna be fun for everybody.

16:24.969 --> 16:26.037
- That's bullshit.
- No, it's not.

16:26.137 --> 16:29.351
That's bullshit, Jeff. Yes, it is.
You thought it was gonna be fun for you.

hear about the Ohio Howl?

- The Ohio what?
- Howl... like at the moon.

- Sean, shut the hell up.

- Oh, yeah.

word at the ranger's office,

gonna send someone as soon as possible.

- Here.

Also I texted your parents, and I...

26:19.262 --> 26:22.132
was vague, but they said
they're sending help.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.167

can send someone to help.

knows more about this place than we do.

31:17.494 --> 31:20.797
- How else can you explain it?
- Look at me. I know it's hard for you.

31:20.897 --> 31:22.877
Okay. But you can't keep doing this.
You're overthinking.

31:22.977 --> 31:25.456
No, I'm not.
I'm being completely rational.

31:25.556 --> 31:28.092
- You're not even listening to me.
- Look at me. It's just an animal.

31:29.705 --> 31:31.108
That's it.

31:31.208 --> 31:35.445
And what's happening in here to us
is happening because it just is.

31:35.545 --> 31:38.381
Figuring out why that is happening,
it doesn't help us.

31:38.481 --> 31:41.882
But figuring out how to
get out of here, that does.

31:43.752 --> 31:45.088
Come here.

31:45.826 --> 31:48.191
You're the smartest girl that I know.

31:48.791 --> 31:50.293
You're a genius.

31:51.093 --> 31:53.897
So don't let that beautiful brain
of yours spiral out of control

31:53.997 --> 31:56.997
because you can't figure
out something, okay?

31:58.700 --> 32:00.904

It'll come back, and we won't have

- We have nothing.

37:54.557 --> 37:57.560

We gotta get out of this damn house.

We can pick the most fortified room,

38:12.609 --> 38:15.678
pool any of the stronger
resources around the house...

38:15.778 --> 38:17.980
and focus on the one controllable space.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.350
Rather than spread out, focus in.

38:20.850 --> 38:23.720
One room, one barricade. No surprises.

38:23.820 --> 38:25.321
Sounds good to me.

- Have you heard anything? Is it Scott?
- SEAN: Sean.

38:28.491 --> 38:33.363
No. They... It's dead. But I'm confident.
They said they were coming, so...

38:33.463 --> 38:36.099
- 911 said they're sending someone, so...
- SEAN: Any minute, right?

38:36.199 --> 38:38.032

38:39.835 --> 38:41.936
You've been awfully quiet, Doug.

38:43.372 --> 38:45.342
I'm just listening.

38:45.442 --> 38:48.743
Yeah? Then what's so fucking funny?

38:50.612 --> 38:52.390
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

38:59.054 --> 39:02.826
Holing up in a room is great.
There's only two problems with that.

39:02.926 --> 39:05.995
First, that thing bashes through
everything we put in front of it.

39:06.095 --> 39:08.932
Dressers and old wood scraps
are not long-term solutions.

39:09.032 --> 39:11.501
They're just cheap Band-Aids
slowing the inevitable.

39:11.601 --> 39:13.035
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

39:13.435 --> 39:18.408
How long have you been here, sweetheart?
You think cramming in a room makes us safe?

39:18.508 --> 39:21.978
I think it makes us sardines.
And I'm sorry, Vick. Help isn't coming.

39:22.078 --> 39:24.714
That's problem number two,
and you've known that for a while.

39:24.814 --> 39:26.749
All right, dude, that's bullshit.
They said they traced my call...

39:26.849 --> 39:28.651
To the nearest cell tower, right?

39:28.751 --> 39:31.955
Isn't that what they told you?
'Cause they told me the same thing.

39:32.355 --> 39:34.657
But I'm beginning to think
that must not be very close.

39:35.557 --> 39:37.741
Okay, but her parents,
they were gonna call...

39:37.841 --> 39:41.431
- They know people in the area.
- Oh, they know people. (CHUCKLES)

39:41.531 --> 39:44.801
People that will... will answer the
phone in the middle of the night,

39:44.901 --> 39:46.970
climb out of bed and hike
into the nowhere woods?

39:47.070 --> 39:49.339
Wow. Your parents must have some
really close friends out here.

39:49.439 --> 39:51.574
You don't need to be
an asshole, asshole.

39:51.674 --> 39:56.379
Tell me something. Do these magical friends
know something that the local police don't?

39:56.479 --> 40:00.117
Is there a secret I'm missing?
'Cause our doorbell sure hasn't been ringing.

40:00.217 --> 40:03.417
So, what's your plan, handsome?

40:04.786 --> 40:06.520
We run for it.

40:07.589 --> 40:09.692
- For where?
- The road.

40:09.792 --> 40:13.696
If anyone is actually looking for us,
we'll be easier to find there.

40:13.796 --> 40:16.799
If not, help will be easier
for us to find there, not here.

40:16.899 --> 40:19.736
- SEAN: Well, I think that's fucking crazy.
- It's not as crazy as you think.

40:19.836 --> 40:22.013
News flash: last time we did that,
it didn't end up so well.

40:22.113 --> 40:24.908
Oh, I beg to differ.
You're still alive, aren't you?

40:25.008 --> 40:29.012
Things ended great for you.
They didn't end well for someone else.

40:30.012 --> 40:32.448
You know you're talking
about my brother, right?

40:32.548 --> 40:34.514
And my wife.

40:41.589 --> 40:45.459
- If we run, it doesn't matter how fast...
- Get to the point.

40:49.998 --> 40:54.101
All we have to do is give
it something to chew on.

40:54.806 --> 40:58.374
- Like what?
- Stop. We're not running.

40:58.474 --> 41:01.709
She's injured. We're fatigued.
It's not an option.

41:05.747 --> 41:07.147
MATT: Doug's right.

41:10.652 --> 41:13.389
Carl, you're right too.

41:13.489 --> 41:16.292
Not all of us can go,
but some of us can.

41:16.392 --> 41:18.928
Or, uh, one of us.

41:19.624 --> 41:22.231
- Matt.
- I can outrun this thing.

41:22.788 --> 41:25.968
If I just get to the highway,
I can bring back help.

41:26.068 --> 41:27.814
I can.

has the brains of the bunch.

41:43.885 --> 41:45.239
What the hell are you doing?

41:45.339 --> 41:47.760
- I'm getting us out of here.
- You're not faster than that thing.

41:47.860 --> 41:50.462
- I don't want you going out there.
- Babe. (SIGHS)

41:51.260 --> 41:53.996
I know what you're thinking,
but this is different. Okay?

41:54.096 --> 41:56.532
We have seen that thing. We've seen
how big it is and how strong it is,

41:56.632 --> 41:58.934
- and that means it's got to be slow.
- You're assuming that.

41:59.034 --> 42:03.740
I'm not. Listen to me. If we can create
a diversion or distract it somehow,

42:03.840 --> 42:06.947
I'll have a head start, and that
thing won't stand a chance. Okay?

42:07.047 --> 42:09.679
I will haul ass through those woods,
and I will find help.

42:09.779 --> 42:12.648
I will not stop until I do. Okay?

42:12.748 --> 42:14.948

those peaks, remember?

42:17.418 --> 42:20.857
Look, you know, we got these, all right?

42:21.257 --> 42:26.028
I don't know what the range is on them,
but I'm gonna call you.

42:26.128 --> 42:30.697
I'm gonna call you until you answer
so that you can guide me back.

42:32.801 --> 42:35.769
You're the most important thing to me.
I got to get you out of here.

42:38.673 --> 42:41.175
- Who'll distract it?
- CARL: I will.

42:44.379 --> 42:48.015
I've looked down that thing's throat too
many times. I'm not afraid of it anymore.

42:49.284 --> 42:52.219
Just wanna get everyone home safe.

49:47.001 --> 49:49.071
Vicky. Vicky, can you hear me?

49:49.171 --> 49:51.573
- Guys, please open up!
- That's it, asshole!

49:51.673 --> 49:54.777
Stay back, or I'll bash your skulls in,
so help me God.

49:54.877 --> 49:57.479

Oh, shit, Carl. Thank God...

51:25.233 --> 51:28.570
You gotta be shitting me. Hey! Hey!

51:28.670 --> 51:31.707
You're gonna have to keep it down.
That thing will hear you, remember?

51:31.807 --> 51:34.743
You're kidding me with this, right?
It's a joke.

51:34.843 --> 51:36.778
What do you think you're doing?

51:36.878 --> 51:39.212
Protecting the others from monsters.

51:41.649 --> 51:44.720
(CHUCKLES) Really funny, Carl.

51:44.820 --> 51:48.257
Call me what you want, but I did
what was necessary to survive.

51:48.357 --> 51:50.773
I was willing to make the tough call.

51:54.829 --> 51:57.116
You can't save everyone, Carl.

51:57.216 --> 52:00.602
You'll... You'll try, but we'll all die.

52:00.702 --> 52:03.806
You know, at least I can cope with the reality.

52:03.906 --> 52:06.875
At least I can see the
forest from the trees.

52:06.975 --> 52:09.211
(SHOUTS) Who's the monster now?

52:09.311 --> 52:10.744

Hey.

Liss?

Alissa.

52:37.838 --> 52:39.908
I can't stop.

52:40.208 --> 52:44.046
If I do, I'll think about what
that thing might have done to him.

52:44.146 --> 52:47.213
Or relive watching what it did to Jeff.

52:48.582 --> 52:52.966
But if I keep my eyes here and I focus,

52:53.322 --> 52:55.988
I can imagine what I'm gonna do to it.

52:57.792 --> 53:00.596
I'm gonna kill that thing, Mandy.

53:00.696 --> 53:03.930
I'm not gonna run anymore.
I'm gonna kill it.

53:05.500 --> 53:09.335
I don't know how, but I will.

53:13.374 --> 53:15.775

count me in, okay?

53:48.743 --> 53:50.977

54:26.748 --> 54:28.950
It's on the tip of my tongue.
I'm, like, blank. I'm, like, an idiot.

54:33.488 --> 54:37.559
You know, I'm sorry. It's been,
like, stuck in my head all night.

54:37.659 --> 54:40.227
You know, and I just... (EXHALES)

54:41.929 --> 54:45.334
I've had to run for
my life twice tonight.

54:45.834 --> 54:48.770

anyone will ever have to do,

54:48.870 --> 54:51.340
like, in their entire lives.

54:51.440 --> 54:55.508
You know? And it's just, like... You start
thinking about all this weird shit.

54:56.645 --> 54:59.097
Okay. Like, they say,
like, you think about, like,

54:59.197 --> 55:01.717
your life flashing before
your eyes or something.

55:01.817 --> 55:04.253
But, like, that's...
it's not been my experience.

55:04.353 --> 55:07.189
My experience is, like, thinking, like,

55:07.289 --> 55:10.626
"What was the last song I listened to
on my iPod?" Like, Taylor Swift. Really.

55:10.726 --> 55:14.301
Like, that's gonna be the
last thing I hear? Like...

55:14.801 --> 55:19.401
Remember junior year... when I
was breaking out, like, horrible.

55:19.501 --> 55:23.905
Remember I was, like, using a lot of
foundation? Going through a period.

55:24.005 --> 55:28.243
I stole, like,
99% of that from the MAC store.

55:28.343 --> 55:32.559
Like, you start thinking about,
like, secrets, you know. Like...

55:32.659 --> 55:34.983
Like shit you don't wanna
die with, you know.

55:35.083 --> 55:39.960
Like secrets you don't wanna die with.
They're like secrets that other people...

55:40.622 --> 55:43.289
- have to die with.
- Sean, you're not gonna die.

55:43.389 --> 55:46.428
No, we're gonna get out of here and
we're gonna forget all about this place.

55:46.528 --> 55:47.654
Mandy, um...

55:55.870 --> 56:00.039
I was... I was in love with Jeff.

56:01.842 --> 56:03.776
Of course you were.

56:04.578 --> 56:05.814
Who wasn't?

56:05.914 --> 56:10.019
No, like, I was in love with Jeff.

56:10.419 --> 56:12.187
- That's great. Let's just drop it.
- No, no, please.

56:12.287 --> 56:15.191
I need you to hear this.
I just can't be buried with this.

56:15.291 --> 56:17.593
You're not getting buried at all,
so let's just drop it, okay?

56:17.693 --> 56:20.829
You had a gay crush on
my boyfriend. That's fine.

56:20.929 --> 56:22.462
Okay? He's dead now.

56:23.998 --> 56:27.603
Oh, my God. Like, how can
you even talk like that?

56:27.703 --> 56:30.972
I don't wanna talk at all.
I wanna drop it. So does Alissa.

56:31.072 --> 56:33.975
- Right?
- We get it, Sean.

56:34.075 --> 56:35.909
- Just move on.

- You're an asshole.

- Please, Mandy, I'm just trying to...
- You're an asshole.

56:53.429 --> 56:55.221
I'm not an asshole.
I'm just trying to tell you the truth.

56:55.321 --> 56:58.133
- You're lying.
- Why... Why would I ever lie about this?

56:58.233 --> 57:00.235
- Then why are you telling me this now?
- I'm just trying to tell...

57:00.335 --> 57:02.971
Why are you telling me now?
What am I supposed to do about this?

57:03.071 --> 57:04.673
What do I do with this
information now, Sean?

57:04.773 --> 57:09.678
- I'm just trying to tell you before I can't!
- Stop! The both of you.

57:10.078 --> 57:12.278
We can't do this right now.

You're not seriously going
down there, are you?

58:46.775 --> 58:47.782
I have to.

58:47.882 --> 58:50.216
- But, Alissa, what if he's...
- He's alive. You heard him.

58:50.316 --> 58:51.479
Here.

58:51.579 --> 58:54.780
- But what if he's barely alive?
- How does that make a difference?

58:56.817 --> 59:00.489
Give me that. You swing better
with less in your hands.

59:00.589 --> 59:01.954
You guys are insane.

59:03.156 --> 59:04.326
Wait. Hey, Al...

59:05.626 --> 59:07.880
Uh, is it okay if I...
Can I sit this one out?

59:07.980 --> 59:11.631
- I just don't think I can do it again.
- I know.

59:12.933 --> 59:14.570
Thank you.

59:15.770 --> 59:17.939
You do realize that thing tried
to leap out of there earlier.

59:18.039 --> 59:20.773
- If you open that door...
- Stop!

59:21.775 --> 59:23.812
Here are your choices.

59:23.912 --> 59:26.948
You can come with me
or you can stay here.

59:27.048 --> 59:30.018
I don't trust you to do anything else.

59:30.218 --> 59:32.251
What'll it be?

59:35.656 --> 59:37.628
That's what I thought.

59:39.528 --> 59:43.365
If anything happens to me,
my blood is on your hands. You hear me?

59:43.465 --> 59:45.031
On your hands!

Okay, you guys, ready?

59:50.638 --> 59:53.422
- Here we go. You close the door behind us.
- No, no. I'm going with you.

- Vicky, no.
- I'm going with you, Carl.

59:55.444 --> 59:57.913
- You can't come with me.
- I can't... I can't keep running.

- Stop. You gotta stop.
- Carl, I'm going with you.

- Stop. Stop!
- No!

01:00:04.018 --> 01:00:07.745
I know you hate when people tell you what
to do, but I can't very well go down there

01:00:07.845 --> 01:00:10.726
and tell that thing who's boss
if I have to worry about you.

01:00:11.426 --> 01:00:13.929

There's... (SHUDDERING)

01:03:38.433 --> 01:03:40.101

- There's...

(STAMMERING)

01:03:46.474 --> 01:03:48.741
What's he... What's he saying?

01:03:54.147 --> 01:03:55.948
He's dying, hon.

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:02.924
I'm sorry to say it. I truly am.
But someone has to.

01:04:03.424 --> 01:04:07.396
- Sporto's not gonna last much longer.
- We can still save him.

01:04:07.996 --> 01:04:10.930
I don't think you can be
so sure about that.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:15.401
But he can still save us.

01:04:17.771 --> 01:04:21.342
He can be... the diversion we need.

01:04:21.642 --> 01:04:25.013
He can distract that thing
while we run for it.

01:04:25.513 --> 01:04:28.347
You mean give it something to chew on?

01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:33.021
I was trying not to say it like that.

01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:35.995
- Conversation's over, sicko.
- (MATT SHUDDERING)

01:04:36.891 --> 01:04:39.127
DOUG: He was willing to lay down
his life earlier for you guys.

01:04:39.227 --> 01:04:41.796
Don't you see it? Now he can.

01:04:41.896 --> 01:04:43.732
- (MATT SHUDDERING)
- As bait?

01:04:43.832 --> 01:04:46.832
- He's already dead.
- Not yet.

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:53.475
Carl was the most capable of all of us.

01:04:53.575 --> 01:04:57.676
If that thing got to him,
how can we hope to do any better?

01:04:58.745 --> 01:05:01.282
Matt, dead, is our chance.

01:05:01.382 --> 01:05:05.420
I'm not saying it's an easy
pill to swallow. It's just fact.

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.889
If anybody has a better idea,
believe me, I'm all ears.

01:05:12.793 --> 01:05:15.864
We know if we open that door,
that thing's coming in.

01:05:16.464 --> 01:05:17.899
So let's trap it.

01:05:18.199 --> 01:05:20.902
We torch this place,
and we get the hell out of here.

01:05:21.002 --> 01:05:25.173
The same barricades that kept that thing
out will be the same ones that keep it in.

01:05:25.273 --> 01:05:26.887
The kerosene we found in
the cellar should be enough

01:05:26.987 --> 01:05:29.055
so we all can make a run for safety.

01:05:29.644 --> 01:05:32.380
And we don't need to worry
about needing any bait.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.082
Being incinerated should
be distraction enough.

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:36.415
(GROANING)

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:40.888
I like your idea better.

01:05:41.995 --> 01:05:44.259
Get us the hell out of here.

01:05:44.959 --> 01:05:48.429
Whatever we're gonna do, we have to do
it now because he's not looking good.

01:05:48.529 --> 01:05:50.064
- (SHUDDERING)
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:05:50.164 --> 01:05:53.800
I'll help you carry him.
His only chance is if we hurry.

01:05:55.435 --> 01:05:57.605
So what do we do first?

01:05:57.805 --> 01:05:59.545
(SHUDDERING)

01:06:08.248 --> 01:06:09.449
ALISSA: We'll get you out of here.

01:06:15.588 --> 01:06:16.891
I...

01:06:18.714 --> 01:06:20.800
(WHISPERING) I love you.

01:06:41.221 --> 01:06:42.782
Oh, my god!

01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:47.522
Now, can we stop acting like
children and think like adults?

01:06:47.622 --> 01:06:51.760
- Douglas, goddamn you!
- It was so simple! He was dead!

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:55.596
- You killed him!
- I didn't kill anyone, sweetheart.

01:06:55.696 --> 01:06:58.397
I sped up a clock
that was already ticking.

01:07:00.166 --> 01:07:03.671
All you had to do was bring
this sack of meat outside...

01:07:03.771 --> 01:07:05.840
and let that thing in while we ran!

01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:10.011
But no, that was too damn hard
for any of you to fucking grasp!

01:07:10.111 --> 01:07:12.146
So I'll just have to do it myself!

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:15.450
- You're a lunatic!
- I'm a survivor!

01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:17.852
I'm not afraid to do
what needs to be done,

01:07:17.952 --> 01:07:20.052
which is more than can
be said about any of you.

01:07:21.555 --> 01:07:23.525
You're all welcome to join me.

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:27.428
And I'm not gonna sit around here
and wait for you guys to discuss it.

01:07:27.528 --> 01:07:30.228
So, what's it gonna be?

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:36.204
Ah, I guess it's true
what they say. You...
