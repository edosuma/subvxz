WEBVTT

05:06.475 --> 05:08.725
Come on, boy. Come on, now!

05:31.225 --> 05:33.083
Town boy, aren't you?

05:33.183 --> 05:36.058
Brought up on a bloody bottle, I suppose.

05:40.558 --> 05:42.725
Everything out of a packet.

05:44.350 --> 05:47.100
Never saw a cow till you got out here.

06:01.142 --> 06:04.058
Want me to drag you behind me in a bucket?

06:04.475 --> 06:09.100
When I was your age,
I used to do 22 miles before breakfast.

06:13.017 --> 06:14.558
You stay here.

06:14.892 --> 06:18.142
I'll get up there
and I'll come back with a bus.

06:18.308 --> 06:21.100
With all those women you had, I suppose!

06:22.017 --> 06:25.517
All those dirty doorways.
Come on, Pocket Billiards!

06:31.308 --> 06:33.225
Want me to carry you?

06:33.933 --> 06:36.725
I must be old enough to be your father.

06:37.850 --> 06:41.308
You want to rest, don't you?
Want a bloody mattress?

06:44.350 --> 06:45.917
Come on, get your hands up.

06:46.017 --> 06:48.933
I can't get at them. Come on, get them up.

07:12.642 --> 07:14.725
We've got to keep going.

07:22.517 --> 07:25.225
If I need your help, I'll ask for it.

07:27.225 --> 07:28.642
Hey, boy...

07:30.933 --> 07:33.683
there's fresh water on the other side.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.042
- How do you know?
- Smelled it.

07:36.142 --> 07:40.100
They didn't teach you much
in that school of yours, did they?

07:46.892 --> 07:49.225
How far do you think they are?

07:51.100 --> 07:53.475
Ten years, the way you're going.

07:57.767 --> 08:00.183
Sorry I forgot your toothpaste.

09:39.133 --> 09:40.925
Not too much, boy.

10:45.425 --> 10:47.717
You've got to help me, boy.

10:52.300 --> 10:53.467
No.

11:12.717 --> 11:14.300
All right, then.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.508
Watch!

12:24.092 --> 12:26.092
He didn't have a knife.

12:33.383 --> 12:37.842
I shouldn't have had to do that
all by myself. That wasn't right.

12:43.092 --> 12:45.825
Wouldn't have been so messy
if you'd helped me.

12:45.925 --> 12:48.800
Hate a messy killing. That wasn't fair!

12:52.008 --> 12:56.800
What are you crying for,
you sentimental, useless, bloody idiot?

12:57.092 --> 12:59.175
Bloody hypocrite!

13:00.300 --> 13:02.675
I was the one who had to do it!

14:18.300 --> 14:21.633
He'd have died in his bloody bed
before Christmas.

14:25.258 --> 14:27.867
If you aren't going to help me,
what did you come for?

14:27.967 --> 14:30.633
Did you think this was going to be
a Boy Scout picnic?

14:36.133 --> 14:38.467
Do you think they'll find him?

14:44.008 --> 14:45.758
Got to get higher.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.425
Got to get higher.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.125
The sensible thing
is to find different clothes.

15:08.475 --> 15:12.375
The sensible thing is to find a village
and wait for the dark.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.050
Do you think they'll try
and take us back alive?

15:30.133 --> 15:33.217
Don't you want to stop
and polish your boots?

16:09.692 --> 16:11.858
I don't like it down there.

16:13.817 --> 16:15.608
You can't go around.

16:17.775 --> 16:19.317
It's too open.

16:21.858 --> 16:25.692
Let's just walk down the road.
They'll think we're workers.

16:52.733 --> 16:54.400
Bastard!

16:58.983 --> 17:00.400
Bastards!

19:35.567 --> 19:37.108
I'll kill you!

19:39.475 --> 19:40.892
Kill you!

20:09.658 --> 20:11.325
Playing with us.

20:13.617 --> 20:15.492
Playing a game.

20:19.158 --> 20:22.242
He can't have heard
about your goatherd yet.

20:28.492 --> 20:29.992
Just waiting.

20:36.533 --> 20:39.117
I didn't know he could do that.

20:40.742 --> 20:42.992
I didn't know anybody could.

20:46.158 --> 20:48.492
He could have taken my head off.

20:49.450 --> 20:52.267
I could have been running around
like a bloody chicken...

20:52.367 --> 20:55.867
with my head bouncing
upon the ground in front of me.

21:12.533 --> 21:15.533
I suppose he's calling them up
on his radio.

21:19.200 --> 21:22.283
- What can we do, Ansell?
- Not much.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.325
Wait for the dark, and then go fast.

21:27.450 --> 21:28.867
Very fast.

21:46.450 --> 21:50.617
If I could've got my bloody hands free,
I'd have pulled him right in on top of me.

21:50.992 --> 21:53.367
I'd have rolled him right over.

21:56.783 --> 22:00.783
Jumped up on those bloody skids
and I'd have ploughed him in.

22:02.617 --> 22:05.200
- I might've tripped over it.
- What?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.367
My head.

22:08.408 --> 22:10.283
I could've kicked it.

22:18.617 --> 22:21.492
I could've scored a bloody goal with it.

22:25.075 --> 22:28.908
I'd like to kick my bloody head
right up into his Perspex.

23:37.992 --> 23:41.992
Didn't that old man have
anything on him at all? Not anything?

23:46.283 --> 23:50.433
If you stay here, I'll go and get a knife
and come straight back.

23:50.533 --> 23:53.033
I'll bury that bastard pilot yet.

23:55.033 --> 23:58.075
Let me go alone. Please.

24:07.825 --> 24:12.367
Ansell, keep behind me. Twenty paces.

25:26.908 --> 25:28.200
Ansell.

25:44.617 --> 25:47.117
Quiet, old fellow. Quiet.

26:02.492 --> 26:03.783
Quiet.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.408
What happened to you?

27:03.950 --> 27:05.283
Listen.

27:05.908 --> 27:09.392
He had a picture of his grandchildren
and a piece of dried tobacco.

27:09.492 --> 27:12.908
If you don't help me this time,
I'll kill you, too.

28:53.775 --> 28:55.317
That's enough.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.817
Watch while I drink.

30:47.817 --> 30:49.192
Get down!

30:51.900 --> 30:54.608
Got his best suit on, hasn't he?

31:57.692 --> 31:59.275
Don't hurt her.

32:20.233 --> 32:22.567
Don't touch anything in there.

33:42.550 --> 33:44.142
You pig!

34:04.333 --> 34:07.750
You stupid, half-witted,
half-brained, idiotic pig!

34:08.542 --> 34:11.125
I wish he had taken your head off.

34:11.766 --> 34:13.808
Stupid!

34:14.600 --> 34:16.225
Stupid idiot.

34:17.533 --> 34:19.992
Crazy, murdering pig.

34:21.766 --> 34:23.667
He should have taken your head off...

34:23.766 --> 34:26.766
and put it into a bucket of vinegar
and sent it to a museum!

34:28.225 --> 34:29.808
What a fool!

34:31.975 --> 34:34.266
Do you have any plan at all?

34:53.242 --> 34:57.242
She'd never have done anything
if you'd left that bread alone.

35:09.825 --> 35:14.158
We're both going to be caught tomorrow.
You do know that, don't you?

35:19.908 --> 35:23.492
All right, then,
you can damn well give me half of it!

36:16.825 --> 36:18.367
Hang on.

36:20.575 --> 36:22.325
Split up the food.

36:25.367 --> 36:26.533
Why?

36:27.492 --> 36:30.408
Only needed you till my hands were untied.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.283
You're quite sure?

36:46.075 --> 36:48.767
- You can have the razor.
- I don't want the razor.

36:48.867 --> 36:51.575
- I'm having the gun.
- I don't want the gun.

36:51.742 --> 36:55.242
You can have half the tins, the blanket...

36:55.492 --> 36:58.283
suitcase, and the water.

36:59.575 --> 37:01.658
Plenty of water up there.

37:15.367 --> 37:17.242
Pockets big enough?

37:19.783 --> 37:22.283
Hey! One for the road?

37:32.325 --> 37:35.617
How are you going to open your tins,
country boy?

37:40.533 --> 37:41.825
Bastard!

37:43.867 --> 37:45.325
Bastard tin.

37:46.908 --> 37:48.908
Blooming country boy.

37:56.158 --> 37:58.158
All right, smarty.

38:00.367 --> 38:02.367
How do I open it, then?

38:18.158 --> 38:21.700
- What do you want for that?
- I want to come with you.

38:23.992 --> 38:27.450
- I give the orders, then.
- Yes.

38:28.325 --> 38:29.867
Give it to me.

38:58.992 --> 39:00.158
Hey...

39:03.158 --> 39:04.700
you want some?

39:10.242 --> 39:11.408
Hey!

39:53.392 --> 39:54.600
Here.

39:56.725 --> 39:59.100
Always keep neat and tidy, boy.

40:07.517 --> 40:10.808
Be careful of your tender little face,
won't you?

40:14.975 --> 40:17.225
And don't forget down below.

40:17.975 --> 40:19.225
What?

40:19.475 --> 40:22.017
Don't want to get the rot, do you?

40:24.100 --> 40:27.267
- Are you serious?
- I've already done mine.

40:31.683 --> 40:35.475
You've got something worth saving
down there, haven't you?

40:46.975 --> 40:50.000
We'll have to eat at night
and drink in the middle of the day.

40:50.100 --> 40:51.167
Right.

40:51.267 --> 40:54.750
And any time you've got something
to say to me, I shall listen to you.

40:54.850 --> 40:56.225
Thank you.

41:02.725 --> 41:05.225
Sometimes I'm very stupid.

41:05.808 --> 41:07.558
I am. I know that.

41:10.892 --> 41:12.975
My wife has told me that.

41:13.725 --> 41:15.017
Oh, yes?

41:16.392 --> 41:17.767
Yes.

41:31.517 --> 41:34.500
- You see the main ridge?
- Yes.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.875
- You see that bit of rock like a fist?
- Yes.

41:36.975 --> 41:39.558
That's our objective today. Right?

42:20.700 --> 42:22.658
What's the matter now?

42:25.733 --> 42:28.650
I'm just following you,
like you told me to.

42:28.775 --> 42:30.925
If you kill me, there's no point.

42:31.025 --> 42:33.942
I'd just be lying here like that old man.

42:34.900 --> 42:39.150
And all you'll have is twice as many tins,
a suitcase, and a razor.

42:45.567 --> 42:46.733
Look.

42:49.192 --> 42:51.383
Later on, I might consider it.

42:51.483 --> 42:54.567
Consider a parting, a going of ways,
I might.

42:55.067 --> 42:56.567
But not now.

42:57.108 --> 42:58.900
Because I'm lonely.

43:03.442 --> 43:05.983
I'll consider it in the mountains.

43:09.067 --> 43:11.317
I don't think that thing will fire anyway.

43:12.608 --> 43:15.192
Funny if it had gone off backwards!

44:24.667 --> 44:26.125
You married?

44:28.292 --> 44:31.042
What chance did I have to get married?

44:33.250 --> 44:35.958
Think I wanted to get into this mess?

44:41.583 --> 44:44.208
A boy of your age ought to be married.

44:56.208 --> 44:58.775
Responsibility, that's what you boys need.

44:58.875 --> 45:00.817
- That's all changed.
- What's all changed?

45:00.917 --> 45:03.525
They don't want to get married now,
not since the pill.

45:03.625 --> 45:05.942
You can have who you like,
you've only got to ask.

45:06.042 --> 45:09.792
Models, wives, nurses,
secretaries, physiotherapists.

45:20.667 --> 45:22.333
Think he saw us?

45:38.167 --> 45:42.667
What he could be doing, you see.
Go up ahead, keep there.

45:44.667 --> 45:46.375
He's coming back!

46:28.167 --> 46:29.417
Go!

46:42.875 --> 46:44.500
Right! Go!

47:01.583 --> 47:03.750
Anybody can have a war now.

47:04.667 --> 47:08.375
I mean, you just get a bit of equipment
and you start, don't you?

47:08.833 --> 47:10.958
I bet he fancies himself.

47:13.375 --> 47:16.667
Probably went to one of those schools.
One of those flying schools.

47:37.708 --> 47:40.833
What do you think you can hit
with that thing?

47:47.583 --> 47:48.775
Not too much.

47:48.875 --> 47:52.792
Petrol tank is behind that cabin.
You've got to hit it from the side.

47:53.792 --> 47:56.667
- Yes.
- You only get one chance.

47:57.417 --> 47:59.067
He'd be off like a bloody bat.

47:59.167 --> 48:02.583
But he doesn't know you've got it!
See what I mean?

48:10.167 --> 48:11.750
My wife...

48:13.417 --> 48:15.958
she had to have her face built up.

48:16.875 --> 48:18.333
Plastic jaw.

48:19.708 --> 48:22.275
An Alsatian dog sprang
right across the bar at her...

48:22.375 --> 48:24.542
just as we were saying good night.

48:24.750 --> 48:26.625
I'm sorry about that.

48:27.042 --> 48:28.708
It was terrible.

48:31.583 --> 48:33.458
Did you sue anybody?

48:34.458 --> 48:37.333
Couldn't. It was her uncle.

48:38.250 --> 48:41.667
Her uncle was the publican.
Couldn't sue her uncle.

48:43.792 --> 48:46.667
I bet he's no bloody good on the ground.

48:49.375 --> 48:51.233
Listen. This is what I'm going to do.

48:51.333 --> 48:53.525
I'm going to twist, run, shout, act it up.

48:53.625 --> 48:55.025
I'm going to go for that ridge.

48:55.125 --> 48:57.233
He'll come over me,
playing his little game.

48:57.333 --> 49:01.025
Then I'll bring him in to you, close.
Now, that's my plan. Understand?

49:01.125 --> 49:04.400
Only go for the petrol tank.
That's the only important thing.

49:04.500 --> 49:05.875
Stay here.

50:36.208 --> 50:38.375
My leg!

51:30.433 --> 51:34.292
I was lined right up on him!
I was lined...

51:34.392 --> 51:36.642
right up on his bloody head!

51:38.058 --> 51:39.142
Hey, boy.

51:41.433 --> 51:42.708
In the last minute...

51:42.808 --> 51:46.433
- Off like a bloody bastard.
- What the hell do you mean?

51:47.350 --> 51:50.375
That's why I missed him.
I won't miss him next time.

51:50.475 --> 51:54.183
I'd never miss him again
if I got another chance, boy.

51:54.600 --> 51:56.183
What about this?

51:56.308 --> 51:58.292
Bloody Christmas present.

51:58.392 --> 51:59.958
If I'd had this...

52:00.058 --> 52:03.892
I'd have wiped that bloody smile
right off his greasy face!

52:04.225 --> 52:06.225
He was laughing at you, boy.

52:14.350 --> 52:16.583
I hope this bastard is his brother.

52:16.683 --> 52:20.667
But it was your job to get that tank,
not to worry about me, you stupid idiot!

52:20.767 --> 52:24.017
No! He had something in his hand, you see.

52:24.225 --> 52:27.350
Something in his pocket.
Might've gone off, boy.

52:27.517 --> 52:31.433
Might've been a bloody bomb.
Pity I missed him.

52:39.267 --> 52:41.267
4:22.

52:41.475 --> 52:44.000
July 17.

52:44.100 --> 52:47.308
It's a good watch, boy. It's a Swiss.

52:53.808 --> 52:56.225
Come on, boy.

53:00.767 --> 53:04.058
If I had hit that tank...

53:04.392 --> 53:08.100
if I had, you might have gone up, too.

53:14.392 --> 53:16.850
We didn't think of that, did we?

53:18.267 --> 53:20.875
I'll tell you what, though, Mac.

53:20.975 --> 53:23.208
There'll be no more games from now on.

53:23.308 --> 53:25.708
I'll tell you something, boy.

53:25.808 --> 53:29.308
He's not going to come in so close,
now I've got this.

54:11.892 --> 54:14.433
Maybe he's gone home for a coffin.

54:23.517 --> 54:25.433
Like to have a smoke?

54:26.975 --> 54:29.225
How many did he have on him?

54:29.850 --> 54:31.058
Three.

54:32.767 --> 54:34.433
Any photographs?

54:34.850 --> 54:37.100
Yeah, a picture of his girl.

54:37.600 --> 54:38.975
No money.

54:39.683 --> 54:42.017
Got his lighter. And a watch.

54:42.892 --> 54:44.792
I don't want to smoke. You can have them.

54:44.892 --> 54:47.808
I'm not having one if you aren't, Ansell.

54:49.933 --> 54:51.308
All right.

55:08.225 --> 55:11.142
You can have this other one
in the morning.

55:13.183 --> 55:15.350
My hands are still shaking.

55:31.683 --> 55:33.517
It's good, isn't it?

55:34.225 --> 55:35.392
Yes.

55:41.933 --> 55:43.892
What time is it, then?

55:57.850 --> 55:59.600
It's not working.

56:05.892 --> 56:09.417
You know what we'll have to do?
We'll have to put these tins in order.

56:09.517 --> 56:11.833
- Why?
- So we know what they are in the dark.

56:11.933 --> 56:14.083
We have to know that.
We must balance our diet.

56:14.183 --> 56:17.600
Look, I've told you, I know what they are.
Come on.

56:18.142 --> 56:19.392
You do?

56:20.142 --> 56:21.958
There are only three kinds.

56:22.058 --> 56:23.875
Big ones are beans.

56:23.975 --> 56:27.558
Square ones are beef.
Medium, condensed milk.

56:28.058 --> 56:29.933
How do you know that?

56:32.225 --> 56:33.808
I smelled them.

56:35.058 --> 56:38.250
- I don't believe you.
- Oh, yes.

56:38.350 --> 56:40.933
I used to work in Fortnum & Mason,
you know.

56:41.642 --> 56:43.517
Best store in London.

56:43.850 --> 56:46.600
Only did it for the experience, of course.

56:46.808 --> 56:48.917
And what I could pick up.

56:49.017 --> 56:51.308
- What you could pick up?
- Yes.

56:52.183 --> 56:54.667
Used to get a lot of Norwegian girls
in there...

56:54.767 --> 56:56.225
and Swedish.

56:57.267 --> 56:59.292
I got this Australian girl once.

56:59.392 --> 57:02.267
Took me to the Ritz. Paid for everything.

57:02.892 --> 57:04.725
Father's a composer.

57:05.683 --> 57:08.142
Lovely big baths they've got at the Ritz.

57:08.267 --> 57:10.517
You can do anything in them.

57:11.100 --> 57:13.892
I offered to pay. She wouldn't have it.

57:15.142 --> 57:16.892
Got any daughters?

57:18.683 --> 57:21.417
I'll bloody well keep my daughters
away from you.

57:21.517 --> 57:22.642
Why?

57:23.225 --> 57:25.392
I don't hold with all this.

57:26.433 --> 57:27.975
With all what?

57:28.975 --> 57:30.917
Hold with all what, Mac?

57:31.017 --> 57:33.100
You give me that opener.

57:37.642 --> 57:40.933
You say that these medium-size
are condensed milk?

57:41.058 --> 57:43.225
I've told you that already.

57:49.350 --> 57:50.517
Here.

58:06.433 --> 58:08.475
Quite right, aren't you?

58:11.433 --> 58:15.183
Why do you want to keep
your daughters away from me, Mac?

58:15.350 --> 58:17.392
I'm a very good teacher.

58:19.392 --> 58:21.183
How many are there?

58:23.558 --> 58:24.683
Two.

58:30.725 --> 58:33.392
They could do a lot worse, you know.

58:46.933 --> 58:51.017
You must have given that bastard pilot
such a shock.

59:08.675 --> 59:10.008
Ansell.

59:12.342 --> 59:16.008
I'm not having you mess about
with any of my daughters.

59:55.633 --> 59:57.967
Not flying so low now, is he?

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.717
I wish to hell he didn't know I had this.

01:00:11.675 --> 01:00:13.258
He's all by himself.

01:00:13.383 --> 01:00:17.383
Yes, and he wants us all for himself,
too, I'll tell you that.

01:00:46.133 --> 01:00:47.300
Mac.

01:00:49.758 --> 01:00:51.800
What's between us and the mountains?

01:00:53.425 --> 01:00:54.467
Nothing.

01:00:54.592 --> 01:00:56.675
What do you mean, nothing?

01:00:57.008 --> 01:00:58.342
Villages.

01:00:59.383 --> 01:01:01.467
No soldiers? No patrols?

01:01:02.008 --> 01:01:03.550
Border patrol.

01:01:05.467 --> 01:01:07.467
You don't know, do you?

01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:10.217
No.

01:01:10.425 --> 01:01:13.550
You don't know anything about it,
do you, Mac?

01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:17.508
I know you're all right
once you get up in the snow.

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.258
Who's done it, Mac?

01:01:21.675 --> 01:01:23.800
Who's ever done it before?

01:01:44.508 --> 01:01:48.800
Why don't we just dig ourselves
a couple of graves and go to sleep?

01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:04.175
Better cross over there
and get up the other side.

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:13.942
What?

01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:15.458
Oh, Christ!

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:28.250
It's not funny, you know!

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.083
Oh, boy.

01:02:44.125 --> 01:02:47.125
I've got to keep
my shirttails out of this.

01:03:21.833 --> 01:03:25.083
I know you're right,
but I hate that low ground.

01:03:25.917 --> 01:03:28.667
I know, Mac, but we've got no choice.

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.833
Let's go fast.

01:03:35.042 --> 01:03:37.167
I hope we're not too sore.

01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:41.708
You were right about that condensed milk.

01:04:55.333 --> 01:04:57.750
He's a bloody field marshal now.

01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:00.417
I lost my hat.

01:05:14.708 --> 01:05:16.817
We'll never get through them,
not both of us.

01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:18.417
Want to split?

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.292
We'd better get down here and lie up.

01:05:27.333 --> 01:05:28.625
We've got to.

01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:31.275
- I can't.
- We won't find a better...

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:34.775
I can't get down there
and let them walk right over me.

01:05:34.875 --> 01:05:36.167
Come on!

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:21.500
Mac, get in there.

01:07:36.875 --> 01:07:39.733
Last time we took your advice,
we got bayonets up our arse.

01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:41.625
Whose fault's that?

01:07:43.583 --> 01:07:47.608
If that black skeleton comes in over
the top, he'll drop mustard gas on us!

01:07:47.708 --> 01:07:49.317
What would you suggest?

01:07:49.417 --> 01:07:53.108
Why should I have to suggest anything?
You're the one who makes the suggestions.

01:07:53.208 --> 01:07:56.692
You're the one who goes in those stores
making suggestions to young girls.

01:07:56.792 --> 01:07:59.442
You've got no right
to take advantage of them like that.

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.150
I think you're stark, raving mad.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:04.025
Bloody sex maniac!
You ought to be in court.

01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:06.775
One of those fathers
ought to have locked you up.

01:08:06.875 --> 01:08:09.750
- I think you ought to be analysed.
- What?

01:08:21.292 --> 01:08:24.582
They should never have invented
that bloody pill.

01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:26.332
Right.

01:10:35.558 --> 01:10:37.308
- Are you hurt?
- No.

01:10:47.683 --> 01:10:51.142
Well, those idiots saw us come in here,
didn't they?

01:13:21.475 --> 01:13:25.100
Come on, boy! Come on!
Get yourself through the middle.

01:13:25.225 --> 01:13:26.683
Come on!

01:13:35.642 --> 01:13:37.517
Through here, Ansell!

01:14:23.475 --> 01:14:27.350
- Water!
- Wait! Wait till he can't see us.

01:14:40.725 --> 01:14:43.017
Hey, don't wait for me!

01:14:47.767 --> 01:14:52.475
Look what I've got.
I'll put it under his bastard pillow, boy!

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:55.142
One of your little school friends.

01:14:56.142 --> 01:14:58.500
Be quiet, for God's sake.
Shut up, you maniac!

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:03.142
If I find that bastard pilot...
Hey, you bastard!

01:15:06.183 --> 01:15:09.517
Ansell, that pilot's trying
to burn up everything.

01:15:14.308 --> 01:15:16.767
I can't take him up in the snow.

01:15:17.183 --> 01:15:22.350
I can't take him up there, boy.
Too cold up there. Go on, then. Go on!

01:15:23.183 --> 01:15:28.058
Goodbye. He's gone.
Goodbye, you little sweetheart.

01:16:22.292 --> 01:16:25.792
Where's your gun? Where's your gun?

01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:35.708
Can you hear me?
Get that mud out of your ears.

01:16:37.208 --> 01:16:39.542
Get that muck out of your ears!

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:41.317
Can you hear me now?

01:16:41.417 --> 01:16:44.667
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Where's your bloody gun?

01:16:47.125 --> 01:16:49.083
It was the bloody farmers, wasn't it?

01:16:56.417 --> 01:17:00.125
The farmers saved us, didn't they?
The poor old farmers.

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:02.500
My face hurts.

01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:04.792
Yes...

01:17:06.167 --> 01:17:08.167
well, you better...

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:10.667
put some mud on it.

01:17:11.083 --> 01:17:13.667
Then the blisters can't...

01:17:14.242 --> 01:17:15.283
See?

01:17:16.158 --> 01:17:17.908
Put that mud on it!

01:18:52.867 --> 01:18:54.700
You see him?

01:18:56.492 --> 01:18:58.158
This time...

01:18:59.075 --> 01:19:00.908
you've got to do it.

01:19:02.283 --> 01:19:05.033
I'll cover you with the gun.

01:19:16.658 --> 01:19:18.033
All right?

01:19:22.992 --> 01:19:24.492
Go on, boy!

01:21:28.867 --> 01:21:31.117
That was your first.

01:21:47.408 --> 01:21:48.575
Here.

01:21:57.275 --> 01:21:59.608
It's here, boy, I tell you that.

01:22:24.817 --> 01:22:26.942
What we need is food, Mac.

01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:35.025
It's here, I know it.

01:24:04.692 --> 01:24:06.858
Unbolt the door!

01:24:07.858 --> 01:24:10.383
No bloody order. No bloody discipline.

01:24:10.483 --> 01:24:13.108
They buggered it up for him, didn't they?

01:24:13.275 --> 01:24:15.025
Wish I'd got him.

01:24:15.958 --> 01:24:18.292
Want to go back?

01:24:19.958 --> 01:24:22.750
Well, I got a drink out of it, anyway.

01:24:24.375 --> 01:24:27.525
He's probably down there with that thing
at this very minute...

01:24:27.625 --> 01:24:29.208
crying over it.

01:25:17.492 --> 01:25:19.100
I've got to sleep.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:23.117
This'll keep the bastards in the holes
they were born in.

01:25:26.075 --> 01:25:27.992
How far is the snow?

01:25:28.992 --> 01:25:32.492
There isn't any snow. Snow's all melted.

01:25:34.658 --> 01:25:37.700
Listen! I've got to sleep.

01:25:40.325 --> 01:25:42.575
Well, you can't sleep here.

01:25:44.283 --> 01:25:46.533
Come on, get up.

01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:49.658
Give us your arm.

01:26:34.492 --> 01:26:36.783
Wish I hadn't lost my hat.

01:27:11.658 --> 01:27:14.200
I can see the bones in my fingers.

01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:21.975
The tips are salty.

01:27:22.075 --> 01:27:23.492
Don't look.

01:27:25.283 --> 01:27:28.367
We smell like animals. Filthy!

01:27:30.617 --> 01:27:32.117
Christ Jesus.

01:27:33.658 --> 01:27:36.033
What have we done to ourselves?

01:27:38.075 --> 01:27:39.658
All right, boy.

01:27:41.783 --> 01:27:45.408
Not living. We're dead!

01:27:47.117 --> 01:27:49.492
We should never have tried it!

01:27:52.450 --> 01:27:54.450
We crawl along...

01:27:55.367 --> 01:27:57.700
slice with razors...

01:28:02.075 --> 01:28:04.492
blow our noses with our fingers.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:08.892
Tear with our fingers!
Wipe ourselves with our fingers!

01:28:08.992 --> 01:28:11.117
All right, boy, all right.

01:28:12.283 --> 01:28:15.950
Oh, God! Oh, Jesus!

01:28:16.783 --> 01:28:18.075
Oh, Christ!

01:28:21.742 --> 01:28:23.825
We're worse than animals!

01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:29.950
All right, boy, don't you worry.

01:28:46.592 --> 01:28:49.217
My wife is five years older than me.

01:28:54.883 --> 01:28:57.450
It's the face I always look for, Ansell.

01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:59.950
The face, and then the legs.

01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:03.117
She's got a pretty face,
but she hasn't got good legs.

01:29:03.217 --> 01:29:07.425
Varicose veins.
That's because of the children.

01:29:09.217 --> 01:29:13.175
She's always worrying about her legs,
she keeps shaving them.

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.883
The children haven't got good legs.

01:29:18.883 --> 01:29:21.492
Not as pretty as their mother, either.

01:29:21.592 --> 01:29:24.883
But they'll do all right,
because they've got her nature.

01:29:31.217 --> 01:29:33.050
What happened was...

01:29:34.383 --> 01:29:37.633
she was always going out
with American soldiers.

01:29:42.342 --> 01:29:45.658
I took my father's raincoat
and I put on my father's hat...

01:29:45.758 --> 01:29:49.842
and I went to a public telephone box
when I knew she was home.

01:29:50.608 --> 01:29:54.608
I called her up,
put on an American accent...

01:29:56.108 --> 01:29:58.233
I lowered my voice...

01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:01.758
and I said, "Meet me in the park...

01:30:01.858 --> 01:30:04.608
"3:30, Sunday afternoon...

01:30:04.858 --> 01:30:06.733
"by the bandstand."

01:30:11.150 --> 01:30:12.900
Well, it was raining.

01:30:14.317 --> 01:30:17.775
No band. But she came there.

01:30:25.108 --> 01:30:26.733
I was 16.

01:30:27.483 --> 01:30:29.317
She was 21.

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:32.900
Came there in a white mackintosh.

01:30:38.692 --> 01:30:43.317
When she saw me
in my father's raincoat and hat...

01:30:44.983 --> 01:30:47.150
she laughed till she cried.

01:30:51.358 --> 01:30:53.733
She went away.

01:30:54.542 --> 01:30:56.292
I kept after her.

01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:01.625
Then the Americans went away.

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.358
I had to join up myself.

01:31:13.458 --> 01:31:16.458
And two years later,
I came home on leave...

01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:19.458
and I was drinking a lot.

01:31:19.875 --> 01:31:22.625
And one night she had to help me home.

01:31:32.250 --> 01:31:34.167
I had to go out East.

01:31:35.917 --> 01:31:38.208
She wrote to me...

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:41.000
twice a week.

01:31:41.292 --> 01:31:43.792
I was away for a long time.

01:31:50.808 --> 01:31:52.058
When...

01:31:53.683 --> 01:31:55.142
she was...

01:31:55.933 --> 01:31:57.142
thirty-seven...

01:31:58.892 --> 01:32:00.725
yes, 37...

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.767
and I was...

01:32:07.392 --> 01:32:08.642
Well...

01:32:09.142 --> 01:32:10.475
anyway...

01:32:11.767 --> 01:32:13.975
we went back to the park...

01:32:14.892 --> 01:32:17.767
on a Sunday night...

01:32:21.225 --> 01:32:22.683
and...

01:32:23.975 --> 01:32:26.225
me and my wife, she...

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:29.392
Well, it was her idea.

01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:35.892
I had her...

01:32:36.933 --> 01:32:38.517
underneath...

01:32:39.267 --> 01:32:40.808
bandstand.

01:32:57.825 --> 01:33:00.575
How long have you been with your wife?

01:33:02.742 --> 01:33:04.075
Years.

01:33:05.158 --> 01:33:07.033
My children are all...

01:33:08.908 --> 01:33:11.075
Children are all...

01:33:13.450 --> 01:33:15.367
I've got old.

01:33:29.325 --> 01:33:31.075
Yes, I've got old.

01:33:32.867 --> 01:33:34.950
Come on, Pocket Billiards.

01:36:59.492 --> 01:37:00.908
You see it?

01:37:03.992 --> 01:37:05.117
Yes.

01:37:13.617 --> 01:37:15.450
I never believed it.

01:37:18.992 --> 01:37:20.450
Whose is it?

01:37:26.358 --> 01:37:28.108
How do you mean?

01:37:29.025 --> 01:37:31.400
I don't know whose it is.

01:37:32.025 --> 01:37:33.650
Never did know.

01:37:41.692 --> 01:37:44.025
Well, it's not theirs.

01:37:46.442 --> 01:37:47.775
Come on.

01:37:53.525 --> 01:37:55.733
- They won't shoot at us?
- No.

01:37:57.108 --> 01:37:59.067
It's not theirs.

01:37:59.817 --> 01:38:01.775
Come on, Mac!

01:38:23.317 --> 01:38:24.858
Come on, Mac!

01:38:37.025 --> 01:38:39.192
We've made it!

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:48.733
Come on!

01:39:08.958 --> 01:39:11.292
Maybe I could hold them back.

01:39:12.667 --> 01:39:15.250
There's no need. Come on, Mac.

01:39:31.392 --> 01:39:35.475
Do you know what? In all that time...

01:39:36.933 --> 01:39:38.558
all that war...

01:39:39.683 --> 01:39:42.517
she waited for me.

01:39:42.975 --> 01:39:45.392
She never went out with anyone else.

01:39:46.183 --> 01:39:50.308
Get up here, Mac! It's all over.

01:39:52.558 --> 01:39:54.267
We're free!

01:40:16.392 --> 01:40:17.808
Come on!

01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:27.517
Get up here, Mac! Come on!

01:40:40.308 --> 01:40:42.725
The day I was free...

01:40:43.767 --> 01:40:45.267
she knew it.

01:40:47.992 --> 01:40:49.700
Nobody told her.

01:40:50.825 --> 01:40:53.200
Thirty thousand miles away...

01:40:54.742 --> 01:40:56.908
she telephoned her mother.

01:40:58.575 --> 01:41:00.283
Get up here, Mac!

01:41:01.992 --> 01:41:03.283
Come on!

01:41:06.158 --> 01:41:08.075
Childhood sweethearts.

01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.033
Thin air.

01:42:07.992 --> 01:42:10.283
Air's thin up here, you see.

01:42:19.283 --> 01:42:22.075
"Thank God," she said to her mother.

01:42:33.283 --> 01:42:36.825
Great, black bat.

01:42:51.325 --> 01:42:54.033
Leave it, Mac. You've got no chance.

01:42:56.942 --> 01:42:58.650
Hey!

01:43:10.692 --> 01:43:14.025
Mac, what about me?

01:43:14.608 --> 01:43:16.861
Come on, then.

01:43:16.961 --> 01:43:18.827
Bastard!

01:43:46.867 --> 01:43:49.033
Say your bloody prayers!
