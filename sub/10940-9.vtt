13:05.851 --> 13:08.012
Paul Bailey?
That's Kit's dad.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.109
Yeah.

13:09.221 --> 13:12.816
The way things are going these days,
he could lose his ranch.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.735
Hey, Kit.

13:31.844 --> 13:32.868
Hey.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.969
How's it going?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.377
Okay.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.949
I heard about what happened.

13:38.050 --> 13:42.077
They backed up a truck
and took off with over 50 head.

13:42.188 --> 13:45.555
My dad had a lot of money
wrapped up in those cows.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.057
So, what are you going to do now?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.251
Ah, well, they were branded,

13:48.360 --> 13:50.225
so the police say
they can track them,

13:50.329 --> 13:52.957
but my dad's not so sure.

13:53.065 --> 13:54.726
And he doesn't want to lose
any more,

13:54.834 --> 13:58.270
so that's why I'm out here
checking the fences.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.496
Hey, you all right?

13:59.605 --> 14:02.506
Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.674
You know what ranchers
always say.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.541
Next year will be better.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.443
See ya.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.178
[Phone rings]

14:16.288 --> 14:18.984
Heartland Equestrian Connection.

14:19.091 --> 14:21.685
No, this isn't Ashley.
It's Lou Fleming.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.656
Fleming, the owner.

14:26.165 --> 14:30.067
Yeah, okay.
I'll be sure to let her know.

14:30.169 --> 14:31.932
No, no, thank you.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.505
Okay, bye.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.304
Mallory, what are you doing?

14:38.444 --> 14:40.810
You know how my parents
had to talk to me in person?

14:40.913 --> 14:41.971
Yes, I heard.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.413
The gold record.
That's incredible.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.949
Yeah, and that's just the beginning.

14:47.253 --> 14:48.550
You promise not to laugh?

14:48.654 --> 14:49.450
Okay.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.546
No, you really have to promise
not to laugh.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.921
Like, not even
an inwardly promise.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.618
Like, you have to say it out loud.

14:55.794 --> 14:59.252
Okay. I cross my heart
and hope to die.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.969
What? I'm not laughing.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.199
So, how do you like the new job?

15:10.309 --> 15:12.243
So far so good.

15:12.344 --> 15:14.505
Yeah? What have they got
you doing? Cleaning cabins?

15:14.613 --> 15:17.480
I'm VP of Guest Services.
I delegate.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.880
Sweet.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.952
Yeah, it's got its perks.

15:21.053 --> 15:24.216
I can even have guests
in my cabin if I wanted to.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.826
Sounds good.
The timing's off.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.454
I'm not saying never,
just not now.

15:32.564 --> 15:35.226
I think it's best for everyone
involved just to stay friends.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.199
Everyone involved?

15:37.303 --> 15:38.702
Who else is involved?

15:38.804 --> 15:39.702
Nobody.

15:39.805 --> 15:42.501
At least not yet,
but I've got high hopes.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.902
You know, that smile's
only going to get you so far.

15:47.012 --> 15:51.472
Well, like you said,
so far so good.

15:56.555 --> 15:59.251
Guys, you've got to promise
not to laugh.

15:59.358 --> 16:03.556
Can't promise
till I know what's going on.

16:13.172 --> 16:16.369
I know what you're thinking.
It's like my nightmare in plaid.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.136
I think she looks really cute
in green.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.775
A school uniform?

16:21.880 --> 16:24.041
Blessed Virgin Academy.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.413
You know the news my parents
couldn't tell me over the phone?

16:26.518 --> 16:28.418
It's because they're sending me
to boarding school.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.953
Blessed Virgin?

16:30.122 --> 16:32.750
Yeah, it's like a convent.
All girls. Run by nuns.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.655
Mallory, you're not even Catholic.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.921
That's the least of my problems.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.429
So, why are your parents
sending you to boarding school?

16:39.531 --> 16:41.658
Apparently,
when you get a gold record,

16:41.767 --> 16:45.134
you have to be on tour 24/7,
so your sales don't slump,

16:45.237 --> 16:47.671
and the record company
doesn't dump your butt.

16:47.773 --> 16:49.741
At least,
that's what my mom says.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.036
I need some help here.

16:51.143 --> 16:55.170
So, I suppose you want me
to talk to your parents?

16:55.280 --> 16:56.804
Worked out good the last time.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.212
Good for who?

16:59.752 --> 17:02.084
Frankly, I think
it was the bad road food.

17:02.254 --> 17:04.983
Fries, burgers,
endless cups of bad coffee.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.523
It cut off the blood supply
to their brains.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.218
What are you getting at?

17:09.328 --> 17:12.387
When you speak to them,
speak slowly and use small words.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.262
Whoa. Just hold on, missy.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.632
You see, the thing is I already
have spoken to your parents.

17:18.737 --> 17:21.467
Okay. So when do I move back in?
I didn't even unpack.

17:21.573 --> 17:25.906
I can tell you
that this whole boarding-school deal

17:26.011 --> 17:27.911
wasrt just a snap decision.

17:28.012 --> 17:31.972
They did a lot of agonizing
and a lot of research.

17:32.084 --> 17:34.075
On how to make
their daughter miserable?

17:34.186 --> 17:37.087
It's supposed to be
an excellent school, Mallory.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.987
And I'm sure
that it's the best solution

17:40.092 --> 17:41.787
for the next little while.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.259
How long is little?

17:43.362 --> 17:47.093
Well, it takes time to build a career
in the music business.

17:47.199 --> 17:50.566
Do the words "one-hit wonder"
mean anything to you?

17:50.669 --> 17:52.330
Your parents want
what's best for you,

17:52.438 --> 17:54.463
and you ought to want
what's best for them.

17:54.573 --> 17:57.064
And right now, that means striking
while the irors hot.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.269
You actually believe that, Jack,
do you?

17:59.378 --> 18:03.474
Mallory, you're old enough
to give it a chance.

18:03.582 --> 18:06.050
And if you can't hack it,
well, then, we'll go to Plan B.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.413
Now, get in.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.214
What's Plan B?

18:09.321 --> 18:13.451
To come up with Plan C
in a hurry.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.429
[Knocking]

18:21.867 --> 18:24.495
You remind me of your sister
with all these schedules.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.230
They're for you.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.738
I talked to Caleb already.
He knows what to do.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.672
You talked to Caleb,
but you won't talk to me?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.300
He's got more experience
with horses.

18:32.411 --> 18:35.107
You know it's not about that, Amy.
You're not giving me a chance.

18:35.214 --> 18:38.115
I gave you a chance, Ty.
Do you remember?

18:40.018 --> 18:41.542
- Amy! Amy!
- Let go of me.

18:41.653 --> 18:44.747
No, Amy, listen to me, okay?
I was wrong that night.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.451
I just... I didn't want to hurt you.

18:47.559 --> 18:49.618
Sometimes you say things
and you do things,

18:49.728 --> 18:51.559
and you just can't go back
from there.

18:51.663 --> 18:52.755
Amy, please.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.594
You say you don't want to hurt me,

18:54.700 --> 18:56.292
what do you think
you're doing right now?

19:04.343 --> 19:05.935
I don't know what you said to her,
Jack,

19:06.078 --> 19:08.171
but she has done a complete 180.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.771
Oh, I just told her
I was sick to death

19:10.883 --> 19:13.818
of seeing her face looking across
the breakfast table at me.

19:13.919 --> 19:14.943
Grandpa.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.520
I might have mentioned that,

19:16.622 --> 19:19.022
well, you have
her best interests at heart

19:19.224 --> 19:21.385
and that she ought to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

19:21.493 --> 19:24.018
I'm sure it's a wonderful school.

19:25.631 --> 19:28.259
Don't worry. I'll be back.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.994
You know I'm gonna take
good care of him.

19:30.469 --> 19:32.767
He loves apples.
Don't forget his apples.

19:32.871 --> 19:36.705
And take out the cores
'cause he hates seeds.

19:37.242 --> 19:38.800
This isn't forever, Mallory.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.141
You're gonna be back
for Thanksgiving.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.307
- Only four pizza Thursdays to go.
- And Christmas.

19:45.417 --> 19:48.352
What if they're touring on Christmas,

19:48.453 --> 19:50.512
and they're in Vegas
or something?

19:50.689 --> 19:52.782
And I'm the only kid left there,

19:52.891 --> 19:54.415
and I'm shivering alone
in the dark

19:54.526 --> 19:56.585
because they turned off
the light and the heat?

19:58.764 --> 20:01.460
Why are they doing this to me?

20:01.567 --> 20:03.831
I'm sure everything's
going to be fine.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.629
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.069
Is it working?

20:15.447 --> 20:16.744
Come here.

20:16.848 --> 20:18.543
Have fun.

20:19.484 --> 20:20.473
Bye, Jack.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.119
That's good.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.651
- Bye.
- Bye, Amy.

20:26.825 --> 20:30.659
Mallory, you've said
your good-byes, honey. Let's go!

20:33.832 --> 20:36.027
Oh, my God!
I can't believe I just did that.

20:36.134 --> 20:37.066
It's okay, Mallory.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.263
No! Now I really
have to leave forever!

20:42.908 --> 20:46.503
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm really gonna miss her.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.307
How long do you think she'll last?

20:48.413 --> 20:53.510
Oh, I'm gonna say maybe
two pizza Thursdays, tops.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.746
Bye!

21:01.860 --> 21:04.658
[Horn honks]

21:13.705 --> 21:15.195
Could see you
from the top of the hill.

21:15.307 --> 21:16.296
I didn't know it was you.

21:16.408 --> 21:18.239
I didn't want to shoot first
and ask questions later.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.777
Seems like everyone's
getting paranoid these days.

21:20.879 --> 21:22.039
Jack's got me off checking fences.

21:22.147 --> 21:24.615
Well, it's no joke when everything
you've got is tied up in cattle.

21:24.716 --> 21:27.583
I mean, you lose a couple of dozen,
you can't pay your ranch hands.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.621
Lose a couple of dozen more,
you can't pay your mortgage.

21:38.664 --> 21:41.599
Looks like somebody wants to get
a real bird's-eye view.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.361
Some pretty nice scenery out there.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.936
No, they're not looking at scenery.
They're looking at my cattle.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.532
You want to make
a couple extra bucks?

21:54.446 --> 21:55.913
I think that's it.

21:56.014 --> 21:57.641
Lou!

21:58.283 --> 21:59.807
How nice to see you.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.351
Hi.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.746
Stocking up?

22:03.855 --> 22:05.846
I hear you're taking in boarders.

22:05.991 --> 22:09.483
Actually, I am running
a corporate equine retreat.

22:09.594 --> 22:12.461
Oh. And you've hired my daughter.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.225
I hope she's working out.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.166
To tell you the truth, Val,
she's working out very well.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.203
Seriously, Lou.

22:19.304 --> 22:22.068
Trading in show jumping
for that trashy rodeo

22:22.174 --> 22:25.075
and running away from home
to live in one of your bunkhouses?

22:25.177 --> 22:27.611
Let's just call that
a little summer rebellion.

22:27.713 --> 22:29.806
But scrubbing toilets
for minimum wage?

22:29.915 --> 22:30.813
I mean, come on.

22:30.916 --> 22:31.905
We don't have toilets.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.006
We've opted instead

22:33.118 --> 22:36.576
for environmentally friendly
outhouses.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.452
Well, you know, just because
you've managed to parlay your MBA

22:39.558 --> 22:40.957
into a Western theme park

22:41.059 --> 22:44.790
doesn't mean I'm gonna let you
drag my daughter down with you.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.194
You know, Val, I'm really glad
we've had this chance to talk,

22:47.299 --> 22:49.233
because I'm finally beginning
to understand

22:49.334 --> 22:52.599
why your own daughter
doesn't return your phone calls.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.402
I can't believe
that summer is over,

22:57.509 --> 22:59.101
and we're actually
back at school.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.009
I can't believe we have homework
on the first day.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.139
Just a sec.
Amy! Wait up.

23:04.249 --> 23:05.841
Oh, my God.
Queen of the rodeo?

23:05.951 --> 23:06.849
What does she want?

23:06.952 --> 23:10.410
Hey, I was going to give this to Ty,
but maybe you could give it to him?

23:10.522 --> 23:11.648
Sure. What is it?

23:11.757 --> 23:14.055
Application forms
for the online courses.

23:14.159 --> 23:16.150
Don't you think it's great,
Ty finishing high school?

23:16.261 --> 23:17.728
Are you kidding?

23:17.829 --> 23:20.354
Ty? High school?
Why didn't you tell me?

23:20.532 --> 23:22.966
It's all he's been talking about
since his dad showed up.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.866
I mean, who wants to be a ranch hand
for the rest of their lives, right?

23:25.971 --> 23:27.700
But you know that.

23:27.806 --> 23:31.902
No, actually, I didn't.

23:32.010 --> 23:34.478
Things have sort of changed
between us.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.047
Ah, you know what?
I'm just gonna...

23:37.149 --> 23:39.413
You two need to...

23:39.518 --> 23:41.349
- See ya.
- Bye.

23:41.453 --> 23:44.718
Ah, you know, I don't know
if this is the right time or anything,

23:44.823 --> 23:47.587
but if there's still something
going on between you two...

23:47.692 --> 23:51.492
No. No, nothing's going on.

23:51.596 --> 23:52.893
Nothing at all.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.058
- Okay.
- Hurry up, Kit!

23:55.200 --> 23:56.167
- Bye.
- Come on!

23:56.268 --> 23:57.235
Great.

23:57.335 --> 23:59.030
No, no, no!

23:59.137 --> 24:01.401
Please wait.

24:05.277 --> 24:08.371
Hey, are you still
doing night checks?

24:08.480 --> 24:10.277
Yeah, I guess.

24:10.382 --> 24:13.146
What happened to Ty and Caleb
picking up the slack

24:13.251 --> 24:15.219
so that you could focus
on your schoolwork?

24:15.320 --> 24:16.719
I don't know.

24:16.822 --> 24:19.017
I guess it's just easier
to do it myself.

24:19.157 --> 24:20.522
Everything's so complicated.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.492
Somebody reads something
into something that you never meant

24:23.595 --> 24:24.892
or didn't mean to say.

24:25.697 --> 24:28.530
You know what?
I know exactly what you mean.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.066
Ever since I broke up with Scott,

24:30.168 --> 24:33.763
I just feel like this huge weight
has been lifted, you know.

24:33.905 --> 24:36.999
And now I feel like myself again.

24:37.108 --> 24:38.473
And the last thing I need

24:38.577 --> 24:40.704
is some big,
complicated relationship

24:40.812 --> 24:43.144
that just saps
all my emotional energy.

24:43.248 --> 24:44.943
Why are you all dressed up?

24:45.050 --> 24:48.281
Oh, I'm just trying this on.

24:48.386 --> 24:51.651
Mark's taking me out
on a date tomorrow.

24:51.756 --> 24:54.725
He's funny. He's old school
when it comes to dating.

24:54.826 --> 25:00.287
He likes it when I dress up,
and he always insists on paying.

25:00.398 --> 25:03.390
And he has this thing
about punctuality.

25:03.568 --> 25:06.128
Free and easy, huh, Lou?

25:06.238 --> 25:08.729
No complications.
Sounds perfect.

25:17.015 --> 25:18.744
Still here?

25:18.850 --> 25:21.512
Jack had me out checking fences
half the day.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.920
I ran into your dad.

25:25.023 --> 25:27.821
Nearly got thrown off of Shorty
when a helicopter buzzed us.

25:27.926 --> 25:29.325
Helicopter?

25:29.461 --> 25:32.294
Flying so low it could have
given me a real bad haircut.

25:32.397 --> 25:35.059
But your dad,
he took it pretty serious.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.861
Said he'd pay me to watch his herd.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.400
Watch his herd?

25:38.603 --> 25:39.331
Caleb, do you have any idea

25:39.437 --> 25:40.597
how much work there is
to do around here?

25:40.705 --> 25:42.673
You're going to go and sit
and watch his cattle?

25:42.774 --> 25:43.900
I mean, can't he get
someone else to do that?

25:44.009 --> 25:44.941
Easy, there.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.644
Caleb, you promised me.

25:47.746 --> 25:48.474
I got my job done.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.013
I know exactly
what's gonna happen.

25:50.115 --> 25:52.049
You and Ty are going to be off
watching his cattle,

25:52.150 --> 25:53.276
and I'm going to have to do
everything.

25:53.418 --> 25:55.147
What are you getting
so worked up about?

25:55.253 --> 25:56.049
What happened to being reliable?

25:56.154 --> 25:57.746
What happened
to "Leave things to me," huh?

26:06.498 --> 26:08.329
What was that about?

26:08.466 --> 26:09.899
Nothing.

26:10.635 --> 26:11.659
Nothing?

26:13.738 --> 26:16.832
You think too much, Amy.

26:16.975 --> 26:18.374
You know, you might be
a whole lot happier

26:18.476 --> 26:20.341
if you just stop thinking.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.526
You're going to love this place, Lou.

26:43.635 --> 26:44.567
La Mariquita.

26:44.669 --> 26:46.728
La Mariquita?
Are you kidding me?

26:46.838 --> 26:49.204
Their <i>pollo en molle</i> is amazing.

26:49.307 --> 26:51.741
Oh, so, let me guess.
You've been there?

26:52.644 --> 26:54.441
Do I have the right
to remain silent?

26:54.546 --> 26:56.013
Well, you have the right
to pretend

26:56.114 --> 26:57.604
you've never been
to La Mariquita.

27:08.226 --> 27:11.127
Wait here a sec, okay?
I'm sorry.

27:16.668 --> 27:20.399
Mark Rodriguez, RCMP.

27:21.172 --> 27:22.434
What's going on here?

27:22.540 --> 27:24.599
Me and my boys
are out checking on the herd,

27:24.709 --> 27:27.109
came up on a bunch of guys
backing a liner onto my field,

27:27.212 --> 27:28.236
aiming to take my cows.

27:28.346 --> 27:29.643
- Rustlers?
- Uh-huh.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.882
So you guys just decided
to handle things yourselves?

27:32.984 --> 27:34.246
Scared them off.

27:34.352 --> 27:37.116
No offense, Officer, but if I waited
for the cops to show up,

27:37.222 --> 27:40.248
my cows would be halfway
to Winnipeg by now.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.984
Close them up!

27:54.739 --> 27:58.675
I totally forgot where I was.
I don't know what I'm doing.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.473
You know what the best part
about doing high school online is?

28:01.579 --> 28:03.672
Um, hmm.

28:03.782 --> 28:06.774
You never have to eat lunch
in the cafeteria.

28:06.885 --> 28:08.250
No detentions.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.947
- Oh, yes.
- That used to be my major.

28:11.089 --> 28:13.785
Pretty good at those.

28:16.928 --> 28:18.862
So, I talked to Amy.

28:20.999 --> 28:23.297
About what?

28:23.401 --> 28:24.732
You.

28:24.836 --> 28:27.498
And her.

28:28.707 --> 28:32.268
I just wanted everything to be
out in the open, you know.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.605
What'd she say?

28:35.880 --> 28:38.041
She said there's nothing going on.

28:41.152 --> 28:43.712
I guess there isn't.

28:43.822 --> 28:46.882
At least, not with Amy.

29:01.306 --> 29:03.001
Now, now, everybody, calm down!

29:03.108 --> 29:05.906
Everybody, everybody,
just calm down, please!

29:06.010 --> 29:08.001
Please!

29:08.713 --> 29:10.010
Now, thank you.

29:11.616 --> 29:14.483
Now, cattle thieves
cannot sell stolen livestock

29:14.586 --> 29:16.281
without leaving a paper trail.

29:16.387 --> 29:18.378
Now, that's where
the RCMP comes in.

29:18.490 --> 29:21.323
DNA, branding, registration
make it virtually impossible.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.053
So I'm supposed to let them
steal my cattle

29:23.161 --> 29:24.856
while you guys are running
around playing C.S.I.?

29:24.963 --> 29:26.692
Why don't you do something
before they steal my cattle?

29:26.798 --> 29:30.529
How about you just let
Constable Rodriguez

29:30.635 --> 29:32.603
explain the best way
to handle the situation?

29:33.338 --> 29:34.635
Thank you.

29:34.739 --> 29:36.502
Now, I figure
between all of you here,

29:36.608 --> 29:39.008
I must be looking
at a significant amount of acreage.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.910
You can understand the RCMP
simply doesn't have the manpower.

29:43.014 --> 29:44.345
Now, that's where you come in.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.213
Do-it-yourself law enforcement.
Why are we paying taxes?

29:48.953 --> 29:51.251
It's all laid out in this pamphlet.

29:51.356 --> 29:52.948
Keep an eye on your cattle.

29:53.057 --> 29:55.184
Maintain a presence on the range
at all times.

29:55.293 --> 29:58.262
And call the hotline
if you see any suspicious activity.

29:58.363 --> 30:01.059
Call the hotline?
Why don't I just call for a pizza?

30:01.900 --> 30:04.061
That's funny, Tim.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.364
We didn't come here
to listen to jokes.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.462
These people could be armed,
and they don't want to get caught.

30:08.573 --> 30:10.700
Look, this isn't the Wild West.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.776
So, whatever you do,
if you see something, give us a call.

30:13.878 --> 30:16.312
Don't get between a rustler
and your livestock.

30:16.414 --> 30:18.575
Hey, Rodriguez!

30:19.818 --> 30:23.447
Every cent my family has
is tied up in cattle!

30:23.555 --> 30:25.716
Now I'm suppose to wait around
for some rustler

30:25.824 --> 30:27.121
to come along and steal them?

30:27.225 --> 30:28.283
Look at this calf!

30:29.294 --> 30:30.659
It isn't DNA.

30:30.762 --> 30:34.163
It isn't some number on an ear tag
or some brand registration.

30:34.265 --> 30:35.527
It's my whole damn life!

30:35.633 --> 30:38.227
I'm supposed to hope you show up
in time to save it?

30:52.116 --> 30:55.108
Well, I don't know.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.847
I don't want to put those boys
at risk.

30:56.955 --> 30:58.445
Oh, there's no risk.

30:58.556 --> 31:01.491
All I want them to do
is for what the good constable said.

31:01.593 --> 31:04.391
Just report any comings and goings.
Make a call if they see anything.

31:04.495 --> 31:05.860
I talked to Caleb about it already.

31:05.964 --> 31:08.899
Well, I guess I can't tell them
what to do on their own free time,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.730
as long as they've got
their work done and Amy's.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.269
You do know she's back at school?

31:13.371 --> 31:14.770
Yeah, of course I know.

31:14.873 --> 31:18.036
Did you know
that Lou's dating that cop?

31:18.142 --> 31:19.700
Ah, you got a problem with that?

31:19.811 --> 31:22.336
Well, if they werert dating,

31:22.447 --> 31:23.914
I would have told him
exactly what I thought

31:24.015 --> 31:26.245
of his do-nothing policy.

31:26.351 --> 31:28.717
I think he got the general idea.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.254
Do you mind moving over
so I can sweep under there?

31:31.356 --> 31:33.119
It's okay, Soraya.

31:33.224 --> 31:36.125
We're on our way out.

31:38.396 --> 31:41.297
The next time anybody
brings a cow into this place,

31:41.399 --> 31:43.299
I'm calling the cops.

31:43.401 --> 31:44.993
Or worse.

31:45.103 --> 31:48.038
I'm calling my mom.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.311
- Morning.
- How's it going?

31:57.415 --> 31:58.211
Good.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.749
Hey, how's school?

31:59.851 --> 32:00.875
It's good.

32:00.985 --> 32:02.418
I thought maybe
I could give you a drive.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.418
We could catch up.

32:03.521 --> 32:05.250
Sure, but I've got to talk
to Ty and Caleb first,

32:05.356 --> 32:06.380
get things organized.

32:06.491 --> 32:08.288
Well, Caleb's up at my place,
looking at my cows.

32:08.393 --> 32:11.226
And he's gonna switch with Ty
in a while, so...

32:11.329 --> 32:13.695
Did you ever think maybe
you should have asked me first?

32:13.798 --> 32:15.390
What? Is that a problem?

32:15.500 --> 32:16.524
No, no problem.

32:16.634 --> 32:19.626
Just I failed a course last year
'cause I didn't have time to study.

32:19.737 --> 32:21.466
Honey, honey,
it's just a few hours.

32:21.572 --> 32:22.504
Oh, what, so, what,

32:22.607 --> 32:25.542
are you going to do my homework
for me while I do their job?

32:25.643 --> 32:27.440
Well, I was pretty good at math.

32:27.545 --> 32:30.013
So how come you can't figure out
how many hours are in a day?

32:31.182 --> 32:32.274
What do you want from me?

32:33.217 --> 32:34.479
You move in next door,

32:34.585 --> 32:36.678
and you still have no clue
what's going on in my life.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.947
Maybe that's why I'm here.
Maybe this isn't about a ride.

32:40.058 --> 32:41.252
Maybe it's about catching up.

32:41.359 --> 32:42.917
Yeah, I'll take the bus.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.162
Why didn't you tell me?

32:48.733 --> 32:52.362
About babysitting cows
for my dad?

32:52.503 --> 32:54.266
Oh.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.170
Yeah, he asked me and Caleb
to go up to the end of Dudson Road.

32:57.275 --> 32:58.299
It's no big deal.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.604
No big deal?
And who's gonna feed and water,

33:00.712 --> 33:02.145
muck out the stalls,
turn out the horses?

33:02.246 --> 33:03.804
- I'll get it done, Amy.
- Oh, you'll get it done,

33:03.915 --> 33:05.940
while you're out sitting
watching my dad's cows?

33:06.718 --> 33:12.247
You know, maybe Caleb's right,
you do think too much.

33:27.505 --> 33:31.441
Before you say anything
just please hear me out.

33:31.542 --> 33:34.978
I'm really, really sorry
for what happened,

33:35.079 --> 33:37.946
for everything that happened.

33:38.549 --> 33:41.575
Ashley, I didn't know
where your horse would wind up.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.483
All I want is for you
to come home.

33:43.588 --> 33:46.648
It's not my home.
It's just the place I used to live.

33:46.791 --> 33:48.952
Oh, please, Ashley.

33:49.060 --> 33:51.585
The principal called me to tell me
you're not even going to school.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.357
I mean, come on,
I know you're mad at me,

33:53.464 --> 33:55.762
but don't ruin your whole life.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.859
The cars, the horses,
the credit cards.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.699
Ashley, whatever it is you want,
it's yours.

34:00.805 --> 34:03.399
No, it's not mine.
It's yours.

34:03.508 --> 34:05.373
And you've made that
totally crystal clear.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.671
Oh, God, Ashley, please,
I'm begging you!

34:07.779 --> 34:08.871
No, you're bargaining,

34:08.980 --> 34:11.777
offering me whatever it is I want
just so I'll come home.

34:12.382 --> 34:15.841
No. I don't know what else to do.

34:16.521 --> 34:17.453
Nothing.

34:18.656 --> 34:21.386
There's nothing you can do.

34:21.492 --> 34:23.483
Ashley, come on.

34:26.297 --> 34:31.324
You know, I used to wish that
you'd be like all the other moms.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.635
I just wanted my mom to love me
like all the other kids.

34:37.742 --> 34:42.406
But now I just want you
to leave me alone.

34:53.591 --> 34:55.388
Rosalita!

34:56.427 --> 34:57.553
Rosalita!

35:46.611 --> 35:48.772
Hey!

35:50.748 --> 35:53.080
I've been calling you, man.
Why don't you pick up your phone?

36:04.195 --> 36:05.389
No signal.

36:05.496 --> 36:06.895
Kind of makes you long for the time

36:06.998 --> 36:09.330
when you had something
more persuasive than a cell phone

36:09.433 --> 36:10.730
to protect yourself with.

36:10.835 --> 36:13.998
At least the cows are still there.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.077
You got another one of those?

36:24.415 --> 36:26.679
Arert you supposed to be
getting back? It's your shift.

36:26.784 --> 36:28.809
What's your problem, man?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.445
- I've only got one sandwich.
- Oh.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.790
Well, give me half.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.524
I hope you like mustard.

36:50.441 --> 36:52.705
I swear it was here.

36:56.814 --> 36:59.009
Look, you see?
Tire marks.

36:59.116 --> 37:01.380
I'm not disagreeing with you, Ashley.

37:03.754 --> 37:08.885
But the thing I'm wondering,
what were you doing out here?

37:08.993 --> 37:11.018
Arert you supposed to be in school?

37:11.128 --> 37:12.789
Well, I have a job now.

37:12.897 --> 37:16.025
Oh, right, yeah.
VP of Guest Services.

37:16.133 --> 37:17.998
Well, without your mother's
cleaning lady

37:18.102 --> 37:19.160
doing your work for you,

37:19.270 --> 37:22.433
the blush will come off
of that rose pretty quick.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.064
I've known your mom for a long time.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.541
And I know she can be difficult,
but I'm betting so can you.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.103
So, you might want
to meet her halfway.

37:29.213 --> 37:31.078
Mind if I use your phone?

37:31.182 --> 37:32.809
Are you gonna call the cops?

37:32.917 --> 37:37.911
That's next, but right now
I'm calling your mom.

37:38.022 --> 37:39.683
What?

37:39.790 --> 37:41.189
What am I supposed to say to her?

37:41.292 --> 37:44.056
Well, you can start by saying hello.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.904
Hello?

37:58.542 --> 37:59.531
Ty?

37:59.677 --> 38:01.235
Caleb?

38:03.881 --> 38:05.872
Great.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.782
Come on, boy.

38:14.892 --> 38:17.588
Let's go for a ride.

38:27.405 --> 38:30.602
You got anything else?

38:30.975 --> 38:31.964
Nope.

38:32.076 --> 38:35.136
Pretty much my lunch and dinner.

38:35.246 --> 38:37.840
Well, I guess
I best be heading back.

38:37.948 --> 38:40.109
You know how Amy gets.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.377
Don't start with me, man.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.352
She's got some pretty
high expectations these days.

38:44.455 --> 38:45.945
I intend to meet every one of them.

38:46.090 --> 38:47.751
Yeah, well, she's got some
pretty high standards, too,

38:47.858 --> 38:48.552
so you're out of luck.

38:48.659 --> 38:51.093
You got Kit.
What, you want Amy, too?

38:51.195 --> 38:52.924
- Hey, shut up!
- 'Cause she's moved on, man.

38:53.030 --> 38:54.327
I said "shut up"!

39:03.841 --> 39:05.638
Oh, man.

39:16.654 --> 39:19.248
So, let's make this quick!
Come on!

39:19.990 --> 39:21.389
Now what?

39:21.492 --> 39:23.824
Well, I guess we won't be
calling 911 anytime soon.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.529
Let's get to the truck.

40:04.635 --> 40:06.967
Let's move now.

40:12.710 --> 40:14.575
Well, I called the hotline.

40:14.678 --> 40:17.272
I told you, I don't feel good about
leaving Ty and Caleb out there.

40:17.381 --> 40:18.871
She say how big the trailer was?

40:18.983 --> 40:22.111
I'm talking about those two boys.
You're talking about a damn trailer?

40:22.219 --> 40:24.187
I just want to know
how many cattle I stand to lose

40:24.288 --> 40:26.916
if those guys make another move.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.532
[Indistinct shouting
in the distance]

40:59.857 --> 41:01.415
[Horse neighs]

41:02.626 --> 41:03.957
Get out of here!

41:04.628 --> 41:06.220
Now, don't move.

41:12.236 --> 41:14.204
Come on!

41:16.874 --> 41:18.102
Still nothing?

41:18.209 --> 41:19.574
Nope.

41:19.677 --> 41:21.542
- We've got to do something.
- Like what?

41:21.645 --> 41:23.112
There's six of them and two of us.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.148
We can't just sit here.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.944
If we get down over there,

41:27.051 --> 41:29.884
then we can make a run
for our trucks.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.052
- Ready?
- Okay.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.649
Let's go.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.004
Ready? Go!

41:54.111 --> 41:56.045
Whoa! What the hell's that?

41:56.146 --> 41:58.171
[Horse neighs]

41:58.282 --> 41:59.180
Spartan!

42:01.151 --> 42:02.846
Amy!

42:05.122 --> 42:05.986
Come on!

42:06.090 --> 42:07.182
This way.

42:18.168 --> 42:20.432
[Cell phone rings]

42:21.272 --> 42:22.204
Amy, run!

42:26.477 --> 42:27.637
Ty, he's got a gun!

42:37.421 --> 42:40.254
Don't be stupid, boys.

42:57.975 --> 42:59.840
Hey!

43:00.010 --> 43:00.874
Nobody move!

43:06.984 --> 43:08.849
Don't even think about it.

43:13.123 --> 43:14.090
Grab his gun.

43:16.427 --> 43:17.587
And the keys.

43:21.265 --> 43:22.323
Dad!

43:23.133 --> 43:24.327
Dad!

43:24.501 --> 43:26.196
- Amy, go back!
- Amy!

43:26.303 --> 43:27.565
No!

43:42.853 --> 43:44.514
Daddy!

43:53.564 --> 43:55.691
Hello! Hello!

43:55.799 --> 43:58.893
You need to send an ambulance.

43:59.003 --> 43:59.935
Dad!

44:08.278 --> 44:09.905
You know the place.

44:10.581 --> 44:11.479
Dad!
