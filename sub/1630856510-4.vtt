00:01.160 --> 00:04.320
Last night, a bomb
delivered by drone destroyed

00:04.320 --> 00:07.840
a transformer at the Isle
of Dogs power station.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.200
What?

00:09.200 --> 00:10.040
Ah!

00:10.040 --> 00:13.000
[John] Thom was an outstanding
officer. Liked by all.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Are you doing all right?

00:14.000 --> 00:15.480
Yeah.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.480
You okay?

00:16.480 --> 00:18.280
(foot banging)

00:18.280 --> 00:19.800
[Lana] No, yeah, I'm fine.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.640
[Woman] This morning, a digital timer

00:21.640 --> 00:23.280
was sent to a journalist.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.520
It's set to count down to 7:00 PM.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.200
Why do you think that is?

00:27.200 --> 00:29.120
Right, we have a possible target.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.960
[Lana] Expo Two, we've got an IED.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.280
[Alex] I'm not one of them. Not hardly.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.280
I'm just a tech guy.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.560
We need to know what
they're planning next.

00:34.560 --> 00:37.360
They wanna sweep away
the whole corrupt system.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.440
They love playing games.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.240
[John] What exactly are you saying?

00:41.240 --> 00:42.800
That there has to be another bomb.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.400
[Danny] Oliver Jenkins.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.960
He's special adviser to Cabinet
Minister Matthew Pulfree.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.320
Move!

00:49.320 --> 00:51.360
(dramatic music)

00:51.360 --> 00:53.440
Move!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.720
(bomb exploding)

00:58.200 --> 01:01.840
(dramatic crescendo)

01:01.840 --> 01:05.240
(soft suspenseful music)

01:05.240 --> 01:07.640
(door closing)

01:07.640 --> 01:11.160
(soft suspenseful music)

01:26.920 --> 01:29.600
(computer pinging)

01:29.600 --> 01:33.120
(soft suspenseful music)

01:37.880 --> 01:40.560
(computer pinging)

01:40.560 --> 01:44.040
(soft suspenseful music)

01:45.480 --> 01:49.360
This latest attack was a
meeting in a government building.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.880
Cabinet Minister Matthew
Pulfree was killed,

01:51.880 --> 01:53.880
along with two civil servants.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.320
Another two in the room
were critically injured.

01:56.320 --> 01:58.560
What do we know about the bomb?

01:58.560 --> 02:00.960
Well, the device was in a laptop

02:00.960 --> 02:04.000
belonging to Ollie
Jenkins, one of the dead.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.080
We'll know more once we've
got chemical confirmation.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.320
Could it be a suicide attack?

02:07.320 --> 02:08.760
That's unlikely.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.960
Jenkins was ambitious, successful.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.440
Politically, he held no radical opinions.

02:13.440 --> 02:14.760
The device could have been inserted

02:14.760 --> 02:16.800
into this laptop without his knowledge.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.840
Right.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.600
(phone ringing)

02:22.280 --> 02:24.240
DS Morgan.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.680
Sir?

02:25.680 --> 02:27.080
Alex is on the line.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.920
Everyone, quiet. Quiet!

02:28.920 --> 02:31.000
Put him on the speaker.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.720
[Alex] There's gonna
be another attack, today.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.880
They've asked me to set up
cameras so they can film it.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.360
I think it's another drone attack.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.880
Drone attack?

02:41.880 --> 02:43.240
[Alex] Multiple IEDs.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.640
How many?

02:44.640 --> 02:45.560
[Alex] 12.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.320
(line clicking)

02:49.560 --> 02:52.240
(phone pinging)

02:54.440 --> 02:56.360
It's Alex.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.800
It looks like he sent a link

02:57.800 --> 03:00.240
to an untraceable messaging service,

03:01.240 --> 03:03.240
saying he can't talk where he is.

03:04.320 --> 03:07.720
(soft suspenseful music)

03:18.600 --> 03:20.600
They're loading devices into a van.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.960
(soft suspenseful music)

03:38.720 --> 03:42.160
(Alex breathing shakily)

03:46.440 --> 03:48.920
He can't see the reg
plate from his position.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.120
Come on, Alex.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.880
If it is drones, we
need a way to intercept.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.520
(soft suspenseful music)

04:03.400 --> 04:06.040
(keys clicking)

04:08.840 --> 04:11.880
(soft suspenseful music)

04:11.880 --> 04:13.960
[Terrorist] They're ready for you.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.440
Okay.

04:20.040 --> 04:23.120
(indistinct banging)

04:24.840 --> 04:27.960
(laptop closing)

04:27.960 --> 04:29.200
Let's do this.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.040
(dramatic music)

04:33.600 --> 04:35.600
Shit, we've lost him.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.360
(Lana exhaling)

04:42.600 --> 04:45.680
(indistinct banging)

04:56.840 --> 04:59.160
You've got 12 remote cameras here.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.040
They're all connected to that.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.280
It's a WiFi booster ranger extender.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.400
It'll act as a kind of base station

05:05.400 --> 05:07.480
to receive and transmit the live feed.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.880
It'll just piggyback on
the nearest WiFi network.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.680
All you need to do is
switch these cameras on,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.600
then they'll link up auThomatically.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.400
(case closing)

05:21.760 --> 05:24.160
(soft music)

05:26.760 --> 05:28.720
Do you know where we're going?

05:28.720 --> 05:30.800
Yeah.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.320
(phone pinging)

05:34.320 --> 05:37.120
He sent an address in the
Docklands, one hour's time.

05:37.120 --> 05:37.960
Live link to follow.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.600
Let's go, everyone.
Possible drone attack inbound.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.400
(dramatic music)

05:47.720 --> 05:49.280
[Dispatcher] To all units,

05:49.280 --> 05:51.360
REP is Bullion Wharf, E-14.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.800
Bullion Wharf, E-14.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.960
[Commander] Shut down all
airspace over East London.

05:55.960 --> 05:57.320
Drone attack imminent.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.440
I need a two-mile cordon

05:58.440 --> 06:00.920
and a disposal unit for 24 hours.

06:00.920 --> 06:04.920
[Commander 2] Expo Two,
we need anti-drone hardware.

06:04.920 --> 06:05.880
Expo Two received.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.120
We'll deploy our signal
jammers on arrival.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.120
Morning rush hour. The area's
gonna be absolutely rammed.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.800
(sirens blaring)

06:15.800 --> 06:19.240
(tyres squealing)

06:19.240 --> 06:22.080
(sirens blaring)

06:26.080 --> 06:27.240
(horn honking)

06:27.240 --> 06:29.560
How long until the
anti-drone gets up and running.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.800
About five minutes.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.960
It'd help if we knew what the target was.

06:33.960 --> 06:34.800
Well take a look.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.840
We're at the centre of capitalist London.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.000
We're a stone's throw from
the world's top banks,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.880
London's financial centre
surrounded by luxury apartments.

06:41.880 --> 06:42.840
I mean, take your pick.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.080
This is your scene, Lana.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.840
Thank you, sir.

06:45.840 --> 06:49.120
Expo briefing, officers to me, please.

06:49.120 --> 06:52.040
(dramatic music)

06:52.040 --> 06:54.000
We believe we're dealing with 12 airborne

06:54.000 --> 06:56.560
proxy IEDs, target unknown.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.960
Transport method,
unmanned aerial vehicles.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.400
Get everyone indoors, everyone undercover.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.480
If you see what you think might be an IED,

07:04.480 --> 07:07.200
do not approach, alert your nearest expo.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.800
Well in that case, we should
evacuate the entire area.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.080
Just get as many people
off the streets as you can.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.840
All right, guys. You heard
her, let's clear the streets.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.520
Boss, there's a lot of ground to cover.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.720
Maybe we should split up.

07:18.720 --> 07:21.000
I can take this path. You take the other.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.640
Yeah, thanks, Hass. I'll let
you know if I need your help.

07:23.640 --> 07:25.720
Copy that. Just thought
it might be a better use

07:25.720 --> 07:27.800
of our resources, boss.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.920
Let's go.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.720
(soft suspenseful music)

07:46.720 --> 07:49.400
(keys clicking)

07:51.000 --> 07:54.240
(soft suspenseful music)

07:54.240 --> 07:55.680
[Officer On Bullhorn] Please stay calm

07:55.680 --> 07:58.120
and make your way to safety.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.480
Please keep moving this way.

08:01.480 --> 08:05.240
(siren blaring in distance)

08:06.160 --> 08:08.800
Alex has sent the link
through for the drone cameras.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.360
And it's not loading.
Will you get the iPad up?

08:13.360 --> 08:16.040
[Officer] Everybody keep moving.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.560
(soft suspenseful music)

08:21.200 --> 08:23.200
It's time.

08:24.120 --> 08:26.640
Heads up. Intel incoming.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.120
(soft suspenseful music)

08:33.800 --> 08:35.000
What, is it still not loading?

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
No.

08:39.000 --> 08:39.880
Ready?

08:39.880 --> 08:41.200
Born ready.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.680
(soft suspenseful music)

08:48.640 --> 08:49.920
(bomb exploding)

08:49.920 --> 08:52.840
(crowd screaming)

08:56.160 --> 08:59.200
(bomb exploding)

08:59.200 --> 09:01.120
That sounded like it was ground level.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.200
Yeah.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.520
(bomb exploding)

09:05.520 --> 09:08.400
- What is going on?
- They on the list, Lana.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.520
Don't know.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.040
(dramatic music)

09:13.040 --> 09:15.880
(crowd panicking)

09:15.880 --> 09:18.200
Oi, get off there, get inside!

09:18.200 --> 09:21.040
(dramatic music)

09:27.320 --> 09:29.920
It's a scooter, it's not
the drones, get back!

09:29.920 --> 09:31.240
Get out of the way!

09:31.240 --> 09:34.920
Get off this, get back! Clear the way!

09:34.920 --> 09:37.080
There's cameras on the scooters.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.440
Expo Two to all units,

09:38.440 --> 09:41.120
IEDs are not being transported by drones.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.160
They're on the scooters.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.840
Repeat, not on the
drones, on the scooters.

09:45.880 --> 09:48.080
(dramatic music)

09:48.080 --> 09:50.920
(crowd shouting)

09:52.560 --> 09:55.880
(bomb exploding)

09:55.880 --> 09:57.960
Stop!

09:59.760 --> 10:04.200
Stop!

10:04.200 --> 10:05.880
Get off the scooter!

10:05.880 --> 10:06.720
Stop!

10:06.720 --> 10:09.120
(bomb exploding)

10:09.120 --> 10:12.200
(debris scattering)

10:16.440 --> 10:18.440
Lana!

10:18.960 --> 10:20.560
Lana!

10:20.560 --> 10:23.880
Lana, wait. Wait wait,
don't move, don't move.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.200
I'm okay.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.040
You know you're not here to be

10:28.040 --> 10:30.120
pulling people off scooters.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.800
I'm all right. Just gonna go down there.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.440
(dramatic crescendo)

10:41.200 --> 10:43.960
(sirens blaring)

10:49.680 --> 10:52.080
(soft music)

10:58.240 --> 11:00.680
(phone ringing)

11:00.680 --> 11:03.160
(soft music)

11:09.440 --> 11:12.440
(people chattering)

11:15.800 --> 11:18.800
You been playing hero again, Wash?

11:21.780 --> 11:23.780
You all right, mate?

11:24.620 --> 11:26.740
Yeah, I'm fine.

11:26.740 --> 11:30.900
But you need to take
better care of yourself.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.740
You're right in the thick of it.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.980
All this, and what happened to Thom.

11:34.980 --> 11:38.500
And you getting straight back
on the job. That's a lot.

11:38.500 --> 11:42.180
You saved lives today, but
you know it takes its toll.

11:43.140 --> 11:45.180
If you got any feelings
or anything on your plate

11:45.180 --> 11:48.740
that you wanna talk about,
then you know I'm here, yeah?

11:49.940 --> 11:52.620
(siren blaring)

11:54.660 --> 11:56.660
Sonya?

11:58.340 --> 12:00.340
No rest for the wicked.

12:01.380 --> 12:04.060
(siren blaring)

12:09.820 --> 12:10.940
How are you, Lana?

12:10.940 --> 12:12.620
Have the medics checked you over?

12:12.620 --> 12:14.660
Yeah, sir. I'm fine.

12:14.660 --> 12:15.900
Just a few minor scratches.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.180
I'll need your full report
for the home secretary.

12:18.180 --> 12:19.860
ASAP, I'm afraid.

12:19.860 --> 12:21.940
An attack of this size ...

12:23.580 --> 12:24.620
If you need to take the day,

12:24.620 --> 12:26.620
I'm sure Hassan would
be more than capable.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.940
No, that's fine, sir.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.020
I'll get that to you today, no problem.

12:31.180 --> 12:34.420
See you back at HQ then.
Once we've wrapped up here.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.500
Thanks, sir.

12:42.940 --> 12:43.900
That's all remaining scooters

12:43.900 --> 12:45.380
accounted for and disarmed, sir.

12:45.380 --> 12:48.100
Thank God.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.300
- Here.
- Thanks.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.380
Head back to HQ.

12:53.420 --> 12:55.860
Hi, Mum, I'm at work. I can't really talk.

12:57.540 --> 12:59.380
Okay, okay.

12:59.380 --> 13:02.020
I'll swing by on my way,
but can't stay for long.

13:02.020 --> 13:04.100
See you in a bit, bye.

13:05.340 --> 13:07.340
Little detour on the way.

13:07.940 --> 13:09.700
[Val] You take it
like it never happened,

13:09.700 --> 13:12.260
acting like you haven't a son.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.020
It's not healthy.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.380
And sitting upstairs
in his room all day,

13:17.380 --> 13:19.540
that's healthy, is it?

13:19.540 --> 13:21.620
Sitting upst ...

13:21.620 --> 13:23.220
[Lana] What's going on?

13:23.220 --> 13:25.780
Sorry, love, didn't hear
you come in. You okay?

13:25.780 --> 13:27.460
Yeah, I'm working.

13:27.460 --> 13:28.540
How's it all going?

13:28.540 --> 13:29.740
Cheer.

13:29.740 --> 13:30.620
Sit down, love.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.300
No, I'm all right. What's up?

13:32.300 --> 13:33.220
Cup of tea or ...

13:33.220 --> 13:35.780
No, stop fussing me and
tell me what's happened.

13:39.180 --> 13:40.060
Dad?

13:40.060 --> 13:42.500
She says she wants a divorce.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.100
Well you obviously don't mean that.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.180
All I said was,

13:46.820 --> 13:49.420
something needs to change, that's all.

13:49.420 --> 13:50.380
Can't go on like this.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.820
Like what?

13:51.820 --> 13:53.980
He's never here.

13:53.980 --> 13:57.220
You're never here, Jeff. Even
when you are, you're not!

13:57.220 --> 13:59.620
You know he's been hiding around at yours

13:59.620 --> 14:02.260
all the time you were home.
- I aint been hiding!

14:02.260 --> 14:03.340
Yeah, well, that's all right, Mum.

14:03.340 --> 14:06.860
It's okay if people need,
you know, their own space.

14:06.860 --> 14:08.780
You'd know.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.580
(Lana scoffing)

14:10.580 --> 14:13.020
All right, well, I'm
sorry I had to get away,

14:13.020 --> 14:14.140
but I had to.

14:14.140 --> 14:15.620
You know, this didn't just happen to you.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.700
It happened to us all.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.940
I'm well aware of that, thanks, Lana.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.300
You, both of you.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.100
Both of you, you just
left me here on me own.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.420
Drowning in all this grief.

14:27.420 --> 14:30.500
Sorry, sorry. Do you think
I am not feeling this too?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.260
All I ever wanted was for Billy to be

14:32.260 --> 14:33.340
the man he could have been.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.620
He was a good boy.

14:35.620 --> 14:38.260
He wasn't tough like you, Lana.

14:38.260 --> 14:39.940
I can't help that, Mum.

14:39.940 --> 14:42.020
He needed us more.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.340
What was it you used to say?

14:45.340 --> 14:47.380
He should take responsibility.

14:47.380 --> 14:49.140
He was a grown man!

14:49.140 --> 14:49.980
(phone ringing)

14:49.980 --> 14:52.460
Now how was he ever gonna learn
to stand on his own two feet

14:52.460 --> 14:54.420
with us always hovering over him?

14:54.420 --> 14:57.300
Danny, listen, can you
just give me two minutes?

14:57.300 --> 14:59.020
Yeah, two minutes please.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.940
You had to just jump in

15:00.940 --> 15:02.980
every time he did something stupid.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.740
All right, listen, stop.

15:04.740 --> 15:07.620
We all tried with Billy. We did, we tried.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.700
He wasn't well, Mum, he was ill.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.780
Can we stop blaming each other

15:12.780 --> 15:14.140
and start looking after each other?

15:14.140 --> 15:16.220
Start loving each other please.

15:23.180 --> 15:25.740
(door closing)

15:31.140 --> 15:32.100
(buckle clicking)

15:32.100 --> 15:34.260
Are you all right?

15:34.260 --> 15:36.100
Yeah.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.020
Are you sure?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.100
Yeah.

15:44.220 --> 15:47.060
(engine starting)

15:48.980 --> 15:51.540
(aeroplane flying)

15:51.540 --> 15:53.140
- What?
- Yeah.

15:53.140 --> 15:55.420
[Hassan] Danny said
that you'd run towards

15:55.420 --> 15:57.100
one of those devices.

15:57.100 --> 16:00.100
Yeah, I saw a woman
on one of the scooters.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.100
Nearly got to her in time.

16:02.100 --> 16:05.020
And you had to be the
one to run after her?

16:05.020 --> 16:06.740
Yeah, that's what we do, isn't it?

16:06.740 --> 16:08.140
You're the senior, Wash.

16:08.140 --> 16:09.460
Have you still got a problem with that?

16:09.460 --> 16:10.380
No.

16:10.380 --> 16:12.540
Okay, you saying you
coulda done a better job?

16:12.540 --> 16:15.460
We're not in school,
okay? You're a good boss.

16:15.460 --> 16:16.700
But you're taking risks.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.700
You're a valuable asset
as an expo, you know that.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.620
But it seems like you
don't give a shit anymore.

16:20.620 --> 16:21.700
Oh no, I do give a shit.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.620
I could just do without you making my life

16:23.620 --> 16:25.420
any harder than it is right now.

16:25.420 --> 16:27.500
Okay.

16:28.140 --> 16:30.700
What's the number one cause of
death for expos in the field?

16:30.700 --> 16:31.540
Are you being serious?

16:31.540 --> 16:33.380
Complacency.

16:33.380 --> 16:36.420
Things go to shit when you lose your cool.

16:36.420 --> 16:37.900
Okay, you've been on a personal crusade

16:37.900 --> 16:40.780
since you lost your brother and Thom.

16:40.780 --> 16:42.860
Just, don't die on our watch.

16:42.860 --> 16:44.940
- Are you both ready?
- Yeah, ready.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.980
[John] They've just posted
another video. Patrick.

17:07.380 --> 17:09.420
Our tech team's currently
trying to trace the source.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.580
I think it's safe to assume
it'll be another dead end.

17:11.580 --> 17:12.980
What about the devices they used?

17:12.980 --> 17:14.340
We're still waiting on forensics.

17:14.340 --> 17:16.340
Hass, you disarmed
several of them, didn't you?

17:16.340 --> 17:19.780
Yes, sir. Command
IEDs detonated by phone.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.100
When we get the forensics back we can--

17:21.100 --> 17:23.540
What about the
construction of the devices?

17:23.540 --> 17:27.740
The initial assessment,
very well made, very complex.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.660
Best we've seen the group use so far.

17:29.660 --> 17:32.260
Today's attacks seem a step
up on almost every level.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.220
Confidence has been severely
shaken. The markets are down.

17:36.900 --> 17:38.020
What about Alex's location?

17:38.020 --> 17:40.660
We haven't been able
to trace his IP address.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.740
So he'll help us but only on his terms.

17:42.740 --> 17:44.260
And always at arm's length.

17:44.260 --> 17:46.900
Sir, he gave us solid intel today.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.340
Well his intel's
solid, but his assumption

17:49.340 --> 17:52.620
that drones were involved
cost us lives today.

17:52.620 --> 17:54.580
Could he be playing us?

17:54.580 --> 17:55.980
Hass?

17:55.980 --> 17:56.900
I can't say.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.980
I can, sir.

18:00.420 --> 18:01.700
I really feel like he's trying to help.

18:01.700 --> 18:02.980
Feelings aren't gonna help us solve

18:02.980 --> 18:05.060
this case, though, are they?

18:08.140 --> 18:09.700
May I remind you?

18:09.700 --> 18:11.940
You're here at my discretion
to provide knowledge

18:11.940 --> 18:14.260
and support in your role as expo.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.980
We're the detectives.

18:15.980 --> 18:19.500
And as such it's our job to
explore every possibility.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.900
Sir, understood.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.420
(soft music)

18:24.540 --> 18:26.780
I just think he was really brave

18:26.780 --> 18:28.860
to put himself in that position.

18:29.580 --> 18:33.620
As a civilian, sharing
vital intelligence to you,

18:33.620 --> 18:36.220
the police, putting his own life at risk.

18:36.220 --> 18:38.340
He warned us about the attack
on the cabinet minister,

18:38.340 --> 18:39.620
and you heard him on the phone today.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.180
He was petrified, but he
still found a way to help.

18:42.180 --> 18:45.060
You mean he tried. At best.

18:46.340 --> 18:49.020
But his intel's always a
little too late to help.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.140
Sir, I really think--

18:50.140 --> 18:51.700
You're being incredibly naive

18:51.700 --> 18:53.580
if you think we can
trust this man entirely.

18:53.580 --> 18:54.780
Sir, Lana is right, though.

18:54.780 --> 18:57.140
Alex did put himself
in direct line of fire,

18:57.140 --> 18:59.900
which would suggest he wants to help us.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.540
But we only have Alex's word for it

19:01.540 --> 19:03.900
that he put himself in harm's
way, so the jury's out.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.860
And unless you're suddenly an
expert in criminal psychology.

19:06.860 --> 19:08.460
No, sir, I'm not.

19:08.460 --> 19:11.980
(soft suspenseful music)

19:13.140 --> 19:14.700
It's simple.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.780
Until we have evidence to prove otherwise,

19:16.780 --> 19:18.420
Alex remains a suspect.

19:18.420 --> 19:20.900
(soft music)

19:23.980 --> 19:26.660
(water running)

19:29.340 --> 19:32.380
(water running)

19:32.380 --> 19:33.940
Lana, Lana, can we ...

19:33.940 --> 19:36.020
Yeah.

19:36.460 --> 19:40.140
Look, I know we don't
exactly see eye to eye.

19:44.820 --> 19:47.140
If you wanna win Francis round,

19:47.140 --> 19:50.660
you have to act like the
sun shines out of his ass.

19:50.660 --> 19:53.180
So keep my big mouth shut, is that?

19:53.180 --> 19:54.300
Well, picking fights with him

19:54.300 --> 19:56.500
isn't exactly helping the team dynamic.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.580
Is it? It's just causing more problems.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.660
And he really, he doesn't like
being contradicted in public.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.420
You know, you just have
to make him feel like

20:05.420 --> 20:07.500
some of the best ideas are his.

20:09.180 --> 20:11.860
You don't need to explain to
me how to deal with Francis.

20:11.860 --> 20:13.380
I know how to deal with assholes like him.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.220
I've been doing it since I
was 16 when I joined the army.

20:16.220 --> 20:18.980
(Helen sighing)

20:18.980 --> 20:23.380
God, you are so difficult
to talk to. Do you know that?

20:24.660 --> 20:27.340
(Helen sighing)

20:29.420 --> 20:31.420
Yeah, well,

20:31.980 --> 20:33.980
it was Thom's idea anyway.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.780
He didn't like Francis any
more than you or me, but

20:39.780 --> 20:41.860
he still won him over.

20:43.860 --> 20:45.620
He was smart like that.

20:45.620 --> 20:48.100
Okay, I'll bear it in mind.

20:50.260 --> 20:52.940
(door creaking)

20:54.820 --> 20:57.940
(dramatic crescendo)

20:58.980 --> 21:01.580
Sir, we've got Alex
on an untraceable line.

21:01.580 --> 21:03.980
Alex. Appreciate you calling back.

21:04.820 --> 21:06.820
[Alex] Today's attacks aren't over.

21:06.820 --> 21:09.900
There's talk of something
else, something bigger.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.140
Well, we're gonna need more
specifics from you, Alex,

21:12.140 --> 21:13.860
if that's to be of any real use.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.060
[Alex] What happened this morning.

21:15.060 --> 21:18.380
The video, the kingdom must fall.

21:18.380 --> 21:22.580
It is all connected to what
happens next. It happens today.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.060
All I heard was something
about a big house,

21:24.060 --> 21:26.460
how this was gonna be
their crowning glory.

21:26.460 --> 21:30.060
So there may be an attack,
but the nature of the attack

21:30.060 --> 21:33.300
and where it'll be and what it
consists of, you don't know?

21:33.300 --> 21:34.980
[Alex] That's all I
have. That's all I know.

21:34.980 --> 21:36.580
I, I've gotta go.

21:36.580 --> 21:38.780
(line beeping)
- So what do they mean?

21:38.780 --> 21:41.620
The big house. Their crowning glory.

21:41.620 --> 21:43.700
The kingdom must fall.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.700
However unlikely, we have to consider

21:47.700 --> 21:50.020
the target may be Buckingham Palace.

21:50.020 --> 21:51.540
We need to speak to
their head of security.

21:51.540 --> 21:52.580
No, wait.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.020
If it's an attack on a royal residence,

21:54.020 --> 21:56.180
I need to speak to the commissioner first.

21:56.180 --> 21:59.540
Keep working up alternative
angles, just in case.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.500
Right then.

22:04.020 --> 22:05.460
(clears throat) Let's say that he's wrong

22:05.460 --> 22:07.460
and it's got nothing to
do with the royal family.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.380
Buckingham Palace could be
a deliberate red herring.

22:10.380 --> 22:11.780
Well, whatever's it gonna be,

22:11.780 --> 22:13.540
it's gonna be somewhere meaningful.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.260
When they have a target in sight,

22:15.260 --> 22:16.860
they execute with precision and care.

22:16.860 --> 22:19.060
Except today was chaotic.

22:19.060 --> 22:21.260
I'm not so sure.

22:21.260 --> 22:23.340
Can you bring up the map please?

22:26.020 --> 22:28.500
What do you mean? There's
no discernible pattern.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.620
Zoom in. That's the financial district.

22:32.460 --> 22:34.460
One fixed point.

22:34.820 --> 22:37.860
An area they can control,
the scooter rack.

22:37.860 --> 22:39.300
Ground zero.

22:39.300 --> 22:40.980
Yeah, well, that's Bullion Wharf,

22:40.980 --> 22:44.660
one of those pseudo public
spaces that seems public

22:44.660 --> 22:46.660
but's actually owned by corporations.

22:46.660 --> 22:49.540
So the, the buildings, the public square

22:49.540 --> 22:52.740
and the surrounding streets
are all privately owned.

22:52.740 --> 22:55.540
In this case by renowned brokerage firm

22:55.540 --> 22:59.220
Hancock, Seale and Poole,
who are leading the charge

22:59.220 --> 23:02.580
among finance giants to
buy up land and property

23:02.580 --> 23:04.700
growing up there,
investments worth billions.

23:04.700 --> 23:05.820
Hancock, Seale and Poole?

23:05.820 --> 23:06.780
[Patrick] Yeah.

23:06.780 --> 23:10.300
HSP, wait, that, that rings a bell.

23:10.300 --> 23:13.820
(soft suspenseful music)

23:15.820 --> 23:19.340
HSP is one of the firms
behind Ratea Global Analytics.

23:21.740 --> 23:24.020
Who's the current owner of HSP?

23:25.060 --> 23:27.060
Webster King.

23:27.420 --> 23:29.540
He's currently facing several
investigations amid rumours

23:29.540 --> 23:33.300
of bribery, and he's also taken
several government bailouts

23:33.300 --> 23:35.700
while pocketing a cool 2.4 billion

23:35.700 --> 23:38.220
from the sale of his previous company.

23:38.220 --> 23:41.420
Nice guy. Sounds like
a prime target to me.

23:41.420 --> 23:42.740
Find out where he is today.

23:42.740 --> 23:45.060
Okay, they're taking it seriously enough

23:45.060 --> 23:47.340
to call an emergency
COBRA meeting right now.

23:47.340 --> 23:48.380
They want us down there.

23:48.380 --> 23:50.700
Sir, we're exploring
an alternative angle.

23:50.700 --> 23:53.100
Webster King, he owns the development

23:53.100 --> 23:54.860
where the scooter rack was located.

23:54.860 --> 23:58.260
And, the previous target
Ratea Global Analytics.

23:58.260 --> 24:01.060
But if Webster King's a
target, the commissioner needs

24:01.060 --> 24:02.700
to know before he walks
into that COBRA meeting.

24:02.700 --> 24:04.220
King's a high-level political donor.

24:04.220 --> 24:05.900
Webster King's not in London today.

24:05.900 --> 24:06.740
Where is he?

24:06.740 --> 24:08.620
He's getting married at
his estate in Hartfordshire.

24:08.620 --> 24:11.300
Hm, well, they'll be there, won't they?

24:11.300 --> 24:12.500
Hedge fund billionaires,

24:12.500 --> 24:15.220
probably a couple of cabinet ministers.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.300
They kingdom must fall.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.980
I mean, King is a credible target.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.100
They've attacked his assets,

24:21.100 --> 24:24.060
and now they're gonna go after
him and his fat cat mates.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.220
Either way, if it's the
palace or Webster King,

24:26.220 --> 24:29.820
the commissioner will want to
consult the home secretary.

24:29.820 --> 24:30.660
I'll attend COBRA.

24:30.660 --> 24:33.180
Second unit, you head to
King's estate in the country.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.740
I'll join you there ASAP to make sure

24:34.740 --> 24:36.900
everything's handled as it should be.

24:36.900 --> 24:39.020
Let me manage Webster King.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.820
Tread carefully, and don't forget,

24:41.820 --> 24:45.500
you're representing the entire
metropolitan police service.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.580
I'll need an expo with me.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.500
Ever met the commissioner before?

24:50.500 --> 24:51.620
Sir.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.500
(soft suspenseful music)

24:54.500 --> 24:57.100
(sirens blaring)

24:57.100 --> 25:00.020
(dramatic music)

25:00.020 --> 25:02.620
(sirens blaring)

25:02.620 --> 25:05.460
(dramatic music)

25:23.540 --> 25:25.540
Okay, Francis has the team scouring

25:25.540 --> 25:27.580
every inch of Buck House.

25:27.580 --> 25:29.460
Okay, well, I hope one of us is right.

25:29.460 --> 25:30.500
Yeah.

25:30.500 --> 25:34.020
(soft suspenseful music)

25:37.620 --> 25:40.780
Hi ya. DS Helen Morgan, SA-15.

25:40.780 --> 25:43.620
This is Lana, our senior
expo, and number two, Danny.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.700
Inspector John Pierce, Mid Hearts.

25:46.460 --> 25:47.860
We've got round the venue, and my unit

25:47.860 --> 25:50.460
is currently searching the perimeter.

25:50.460 --> 25:53.900
This is the private firm
in charge of security.

25:56.060 --> 26:00.020
DS Helen Morgan,
counterterrorism command.

26:00.020 --> 26:02.380
We're here on urgent police business.

26:02.380 --> 26:03.980
We have reason to believe that this event

26:03.980 --> 26:07.140
has been targeted by a
violent terrorist group.

26:07.140 --> 26:08.060
Sorry, who's in charge here?

26:08.060 --> 26:10.740
I am, Duncan McMorton.
My team call me Mac.

26:11.820 --> 26:13.020
Okay.

26:13.020 --> 26:14.700
We've got six units
patrolling the sights.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.340
What intel can you share?

26:16.340 --> 26:18.060
Only that it's a credible threat.

26:18.060 --> 26:20.700
My team need to sweep this
entire area, immediately.

26:20.700 --> 26:21.820
How credible?

26:21.820 --> 26:23.300
We've been onsite for a week.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.620
24-hour surveillance,
every single guest passes

26:25.620 --> 26:27.660
through a metal detector,
so there's no chance an IED

26:27.660 --> 26:29.700
would have been planted
without us knowing it.

26:29.700 --> 26:30.900
My men and I are professionals.

26:30.900 --> 26:33.580
Great, then you'll
understand we have a job to do.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.980
So why did they send the B team?

26:36.980 --> 26:39.060
You're a DS. Where's your SIO?

26:40.980 --> 26:43.540
Some of my colleagues
are currently investigating

26:43.540 --> 26:46.740
a second high-profile location.

26:46.740 --> 26:49.260
Right, so you're not even
expecting to find anything here.

26:49.260 --> 26:51.580
We still have to search the site.

26:51.580 --> 26:53.100
Understood, and you have our support,

26:53.100 --> 26:55.180
but you're not asking
us to evacuate, are you?

26:55.180 --> 26:58.620
No, not immediately. Minimal disruption.

26:58.620 --> 27:00.020
Listen, we're not here to make a scene.

27:00.020 --> 27:01.900
What order did the deliveries arrive?

27:01.900 --> 27:04.300
Was there any last-minute
changes, any additions?

27:04.300 --> 27:05.260
We're gonna need to see a list

27:05.260 --> 27:07.340
of everything that came through today.

27:08.340 --> 27:10.300
All right.

27:10.300 --> 27:13.500
I need a list of all
deliveries brought to me ASAP.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.220
Sir.

27:21.220 --> 27:22.060
Ma'am.

27:22.060 --> 27:24.140
Thanks.

27:38.700 --> 27:42.100
(chattering in distance)

27:46.420 --> 27:48.420
We swept the floor yesterday.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.300
And what arrived today?

27:52.220 --> 27:53.300
The cake was delivered this morning.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.380
Do you wanna check that?

27:57.460 --> 27:59.740
Can you at least try to blend in?

27:59.740 --> 28:00.940
(Velcro tearing)

28:00.940 --> 28:03.020
Is that better?

28:04.980 --> 28:07.980
Speaking of managing
conflicts of interest,

28:07.980 --> 28:10.380
I'd like to welcome all my
great rivals and competitors

28:10.380 --> 28:13.060
who are here celebrating with us today.

28:13.060 --> 28:15.060
Despite the fact that
we've played hardball

28:15.060 --> 28:17.140
with each other for several decades,

28:17.140 --> 28:18.500
we're also civilised men.

28:18.500 --> 28:22.540
And so, like the Christmas Day ceasefires

28:22.540 --> 28:24.220
along the Western Front between Germany

28:24.220 --> 28:27.380
and the Allies in 1914, I'd like to toast

28:27.380 --> 28:32.580
to our very own truce, over
this delicious Cristal 2008.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.660
But don't worry.

28:34.660 --> 28:37.060
Hostilities will resume
as normal tomorrow.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.900
(crowd laughing)

28:41.060 --> 28:42.740
Now everyone you just enjoy yourself

28:42.740 --> 28:44.820
while our two families must now endure

28:44.820 --> 28:47.940
the purgatory of wedding photos.

28:47.940 --> 28:48.780
Cheers.

28:48.780 --> 28:51.580
(crowd applauding)

28:51.580 --> 28:54.380
You might want to pick up
some tips while you're here.

28:54.380 --> 28:58.500
My wedding aint gonna
look nothing like this.

28:58.500 --> 29:01.420
(crowd murmuring)

29:12.580 --> 29:15.140
Sorry for the interruption, folks.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.300
My security team just
needs to do a few checks.

29:17.300 --> 29:19.820
Nothing to worry about.
You all enjoy yourselves.

29:21.340 --> 29:24.140
(crowd murmuring)

29:32.140 --> 29:35.060
(flashlight clicking)

29:35.060 --> 29:37.980
(crowd murmuring)

29:51.220 --> 29:53.220
Anything?

29:53.940 --> 29:55.500
No, all clear.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.540
Told you. Now fuck off.

29:57.540 --> 30:01.100
(crowd murmuring)

30:01.100 --> 30:03.860
(birds singing)

30:15.020 --> 30:17.700
Hey, are we done here yet?

30:17.700 --> 30:20.140
Just one more thing I
need to check on the list.

30:22.740 --> 30:25.380
(birds singing)

30:30.860 --> 30:32.860
Here we go.

30:37.660 --> 30:39.660
Just give me a sec.

30:45.140 --> 30:47.820
(door creaking)

30:49.180 --> 30:51.940
(doors creaking)

30:56.780 --> 30:59.420
(door creaking)

31:05.020 --> 31:06.020
What have we got, boss?

31:06.020 --> 31:08.100
Two locked doors.

31:10.860 --> 31:14.780
(floorboards squeaking)

31:14.780 --> 31:17.500
(Lana groaning)

31:22.780 --> 31:23.860
That's weird.

31:23.860 --> 31:26.380
(soft music)

31:29.460 --> 31:32.620
They're not just locked.
They're bolted shut.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.500
Let's check underneath.

31:34.500 --> 31:37.020
(soft music)

31:42.500 --> 31:45.260
It looks like there might have
been a repair job under here.

31:45.260 --> 31:46.740
Yeah?

31:46.740 --> 31:48.660
Pass me the screwdriver.
I'll take a look.

31:48.660 --> 31:50.740
Yeah, one sec.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.540
Ta.

31:54.540 --> 31:58.060
(soft suspenseful music)

32:20.580 --> 32:22.580
Right.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.860
(metal banging)

32:27.860 --> 32:31.020
Shit! We have a timer-operated IED.

32:31.020 --> 32:32.980
We've gotta get this truck moved now.

32:32.980 --> 32:34.780
Get everyone evacuated.

32:34.780 --> 32:36.140
There's enough explosives under here

32:36.140 --> 32:38.460
to take out the whole building.

32:38.460 --> 32:40.540
Go, Danny, now!

32:41.940 --> 32:44.170
(dramatic crescendo)

32:44.170 --> 32:46.660
Everyone make their way out the far exit

32:46.660 --> 32:48.700
and down the stairs!

32:48.700 --> 32:50.340
Keep moving!

32:50.340 --> 32:52.780
[Agent] Everybody on your feet please.

32:52.780 --> 32:55.620
(dramatic music)

32:58.340 --> 33:01.060
(crowd chattering)

33:01.060 --> 33:04.540
(dramatic music)

33:04.540 --> 33:07.100
(metal banging)

33:07.100 --> 33:09.940
(dramatic music)

33:13.620 --> 33:15.060
[Agent] Calmly please!

33:15.060 --> 33:17.180
As quick as you can!

33:17.180 --> 33:18.460
(metal banging)

33:18.460 --> 33:21.300
(engine revving)

33:22.220 --> 33:24.340
(dramatic music)

33:24.340 --> 33:26.500
(guests panicking)

33:26.500 --> 33:28.140
Come on, let's go!

33:28.140 --> 33:30.980
(dramatic music)

33:33.340 --> 33:36.100
(engine revving)

33:37.580 --> 33:38.620
Move please!

33:38.620 --> 33:41.420
(dramatic music)

33:49.420 --> 33:51.420
Keep moving.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.460
(gears grinding)

33:54.460 --> 33:57.260
(dramatic music)

34:08.980 --> 34:11.700
(bomb exploding)

34:13.940 --> 34:17.100
(soft dramatic music)

34:18.900 --> 34:21.060
Lana!

34:21.060 --> 34:25.300
Lana.

34:25.700 --> 34:27.660
You okay? You all right?

34:27.660 --> 34:30.140
(soft music)

34:31.340 --> 34:33.340
That was impressive.

34:35.940 --> 34:38.460
You better have some decent
fireworks at your wedding.

34:38.460 --> 34:39.740
Not these flash bastards.

34:39.740 --> 34:41.740
Yeah, good one.

34:41.740 --> 34:44.220
(soft music)

34:54.300 --> 34:55.820
Mr. King?

34:55.820 --> 34:57.900
Commander John Francis.

34:58.260 --> 35:00.460
You and your guests are very fortunate.

35:00.460 --> 35:02.300
That bomb removed by my team

35:02.300 --> 35:03.860
would have flattened your house

35:03.860 --> 35:05.100
and killed everyone in it.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.340
Understood.

35:06.340 --> 35:09.100
Rest assured, we'll be
providing you with round-the-clock

35:09.100 --> 35:11.340
protection until we've
caught the perpetrators.

35:11.340 --> 35:13.420
You have my word, sir.

35:13.940 --> 35:16.060
My family and I are grateful.

35:16.060 --> 35:19.860
The commissioner asked me to
express his deepest regrets.

35:19.860 --> 35:22.620
He sends his assurances
that we'll do everything

35:22.620 --> 35:24.820
in our power to keep you safe.

35:24.820 --> 35:25.940
We won't let them win, sir.

35:25.940 --> 35:27.420
Thank you, Commander.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.820
Oh, Mr. King, this is Lana Washington,

35:29.820 --> 35:31.540
our senor explosives officer,

35:31.540 --> 35:32.900
who was responsible for finding

35:32.900 --> 35:34.460
and moving the IED to safety.

35:34.460 --> 35:36.740
A debt of gratitude to
you and your team, Lana.

35:36.740 --> 35:38.220
Happy to be of service.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.660
Better to arrive late
than not to come at all.

35:42.260 --> 35:45.660
Well I'm sure it's been a
nasty shock for all of you.

35:45.660 --> 35:49.620
That Land Rover was my
grandfather's. His pride and joy.

35:50.860 --> 35:52.860
Meant a great deal to us.

35:55.060 --> 35:56.580
Well, if you'll excuse me,

35:56.580 --> 35:58.660
I must get back to my wife and family.

35:59.580 --> 36:01.580
Yes, of course, sir.

36:04.100 --> 36:05.700
(Lana sighing)

36:05.700 --> 36:07.740
We'll get forensics to
send everything off to Sonya.

36:07.740 --> 36:10.260
It was a timer switch, pretty basic.

36:10.260 --> 36:11.340
But the size of the main charger,

36:11.340 --> 36:13.780
1,000 kilogrammes of explosives.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.380
They're becoming more
ambitious every time.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.900
Which is I've had enough
of dancing to their tune.

36:17.900 --> 36:19.740
We need to get on the
front foot from now on,

36:19.740 --> 36:22.140
and we'll start by
bringing Alex into custody.

36:22.140 --> 36:23.700
You want to arrest him?

36:23.700 --> 36:25.260
You're gonna have to find him first.

36:25.260 --> 36:27.620
We still haven't been able
to verify his credibility.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.460
If we have to put pressure
on him or force him

36:29.460 --> 36:30.660
to wear a wire, we will.

36:30.660 --> 36:32.380
Please, sir, don't do that.

36:32.380 --> 36:34.180
I think you're making a mistake.

36:34.180 --> 36:35.940
From everything we know,
they're too clever for that.

36:35.940 --> 36:38.340
From everything we know?
We know precisely nothing.

36:38.340 --> 36:39.900
They've been a step ahead from the start.

36:39.900 --> 36:40.740
Sir, it--

36:40.740 --> 36:42.940
It's time we took the lead.

36:42.940 --> 36:46.420
(soft suspenseful music)

36:53.020 --> 36:55.380
(door beeping)

36:55.380 --> 36:58.860
(soft suspenseful music)

37:07.660 --> 37:10.300
(keys jingling)

37:11.700 --> 37:12.820
(dramatic crescendo)

37:12.820 --> 37:15.140
Please, I need your help.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.620
You're the only one who can save me.

37:21.180 --> 37:23.220
[Lana] What are you doing here, Alex?

37:23.220 --> 37:25.140
I didn't know what else to do.

37:25.140 --> 37:27.620
And how did you get my address?

37:27.620 --> 37:30.860
You gave me your phone
number, at our first meeting.

37:31.820 --> 37:34.100
Ever since then, I've
been able to track you.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.540
All right, anyone else got it?

37:37.540 --> 37:38.660
Only me.

37:38.660 --> 37:39.500
So I'm safe?

37:39.500 --> 37:40.740
Yes.

37:40.740 --> 37:42.460
You're safe.

37:42.460 --> 37:45.220
Look, I need your help
to stop these people.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.300
I can't do it by myself.

37:48.460 --> 37:52.340
Alex, I'm sorry. I've
gotta call this in.

37:52.340 --> 37:54.540
No no no, don't please.

37:54.540 --> 37:56.300
I know I got myself into this shit,

37:56.300 --> 37:58.940
but just give me a chance to make it good.

38:00.980 --> 38:02.980
Okay.

38:02.980 --> 38:07.140
(sighs) Fine. Sit down, tell me then.

38:10.820 --> 38:12.780
I was

38:12.780 --> 38:14.860
Mr. Normal.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.660
Happy, I had a lovely family.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.340
Wonderful wife.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.420
Daughter I adored.

38:23.420 --> 38:26.180
Well-paid job, systems engineering.

38:28.740 --> 38:31.420
(Alex inhaling)

38:33.060 --> 38:35.060
Two years ago,

38:36.500 --> 38:38.500
my daughter died.

38:39.620 --> 38:41.620
She was 13.

38:42.020 --> 38:45.620
She was being bullied
online. We didn't know.

38:47.620 --> 38:51.140
She started self-harming. It was horrible.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.820
The tech companies, they didn't care.

38:54.820 --> 38:56.580
They're only in it for the money.

38:56.580 --> 39:00.380
Their algorithms fed her
illness hundreds of videos.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.340
She took her own life.

39:05.740 --> 39:09.740
And the police, well, they
didn't do a damn thing.

39:10.820 --> 39:12.540
I'm sorry, Alex.

39:12.540 --> 39:16.020
Our marriage broke down. Lost my job.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.260
Friends, everything.

39:18.260 --> 39:20.340
Yeah, I get that.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.860
When I was at my lowest,

39:24.380 --> 39:27.740
I hooked up online with this cyber group.

39:29.580 --> 39:33.100
They were fighting back
against big tech, big business.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.580
Like Robin Hood, internet guerrillas

39:35.580 --> 39:37.660
standing up for the little guys.

39:39.260 --> 39:43.380
We exposed secret files,
sabotaged corrupt businesses,

39:43.380 --> 39:45.300
transferred money from their bank accounts

39:45.300 --> 39:47.060
to deserving causes.

39:47.060 --> 39:50.100
It was a sort of, justice.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.580
(soft music)

39:54.860 --> 39:56.860
Or revenge.

39:57.660 --> 40:00.060
But no one seemed to notice.

40:00.060 --> 40:03.700
So the group decided to cross
the line into the real world.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.380
Bombs.

40:07.380 --> 40:08.940
Destruction.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.740
Murder.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.820
These, these guys are clever.

40:14.300 --> 40:16.740
Many more will die before you stop them.

40:16.740 --> 40:19.020
And if the police screw this up,

40:19.020 --> 40:20.940
I'll be the fall guy.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.500
I mean, it never ends well
when you look like me.

40:26.260 --> 40:28.260
But I'll do whatever you think.

40:30.140 --> 40:32.140
I trust you.

40:32.780 --> 40:33.620
Why me?

40:33.620 --> 40:36.580
(soft music)

40:36.580 --> 40:38.900
Because you're not a cop.

40:43.340 --> 40:45.100
You could get killed.

40:45.100 --> 40:47.180
Maybe I could do some good.

40:48.020 --> 40:49.940
Help bring these people down.

40:49.940 --> 40:52.140
Are you absolutely sure
this is what you want?

40:52.140 --> 40:53.340
I am.

40:53.340 --> 40:57.700
And if I don't make it,
ha ha, through this,

41:02.780 --> 41:04.780
tell them,

41:08.980 --> 41:13.380
tell them Benjamin Mamouda
was one of the good guys.

41:13.380 --> 41:15.660
(soft music)

41:15.660 --> 41:17.740
That your real name?

41:20.660 --> 41:24.420
I'm trusting you, Lana.
Don't give that to the police.

41:24.420 --> 41:25.220
I won't.

41:25.220 --> 41:27.300
You're the only one I'm dealing with.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.220
Start by telling me everything you know.

41:32.220 --> 41:34.580
[Benjamin] They're planning
something else right now.

41:34.580 --> 41:37.580
I don't know what, but
it's something terrifying,

41:37.580 --> 41:39.260
and they're gonna keep coming.

41:39.260 --> 41:43.060
They won't stop. No one
in this city's safe.

41:43.060 --> 41:46.540
(soft suspenseful music)

42:08.020 --> 42:11.340
(upbeat dramatic music)
