20:51.598 --> 20:54.905
Oh. In that case I know just
the person you should talk to:

20:54.949 --> 20:57.038
Bernard Moskowitz.Who is that?

20:57.081 --> 20:58.300
My lawyer!

20:58.344 --> 21:00.520
Hey...Mr. Long,

21:00.563 --> 21:02.609
Bao Pham was hit
over the head in the process.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.437
Oh, he was hit
over the head, huh?

21:04.480 --> 21:06.003
Sounds familiar.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.397
It does sound familiar,
just like your long history

21:08.441 --> 21:11.139
of using assault
and intimidation

21:11.182 --> 21:12.836
and strong-arm tactics
against your tenants.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.448
I own a lot of properties.
There are often disputes,

21:15.491 --> 21:17.754
especially these days with
renter rights through the roof.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.408
I don't know the guy
you're talking about,

21:19.452 --> 21:21.149
but if you say we had
a disagreement,

21:21.192 --> 21:24.152
I say so what? Typical
landlord-tenant conversations.

21:24.195 --> 21:26.459
As a landlord, you have
access to the building,

21:26.502 --> 21:29.592
which is why there were
no signs of forced entry.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.290
Mm, Bernard Moskowitz.

21:31.333 --> 21:35.076
Bernie Moskowitz.
Bernie Moskowitz!

21:35.119 --> 21:36.556
Only say my name
and I shall appear.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.122
Let me guess,

21:38.166 --> 21:39.733
Bernie Moskowitz.Bernie Moskowitz.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.474
Mr. Long's attorney.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.693
Come, Connor,
we're going home.
Not so fast.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.260
We have reason to believe
your client was involved

21:45.304 --> 21:47.610
in a robbery and assault.

21:47.654 --> 21:50.309
My client has been travelling
the last two weeks.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.615
He only arrived
in New York this morning.

21:52.659 --> 21:55.183
I have air fare and
hotel receipts to prove it.

21:55.226 --> 21:56.793
Any questions?

21:56.837 --> 21:58.752
Yeah, where the hell
did you come from? Goodbye.

21:58.795 --> 22:01.232
Get out of here.Bernie Moskowitz.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.365
Bernie Moskowitz.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.289
GORMLEY: First of all,
I want to thank you

22:14.333 --> 22:16.291
for giving me
the opportunity

22:16.335 --> 22:19.512
to once again speak on behalf
of Lieutenant Stoltz.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.342
When Detective Reddick
first suggested

22:23.385 --> 22:27.302
we take away his bar,
I strongly opposed it.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.871
And now?But I also believe
it's important

22:30.914 --> 22:33.700
that we consider
other people's viewpoints.

22:35.092 --> 22:38.357
And I did not do that
when she raised the issue,

22:38.400 --> 22:39.706
and I should have.

22:39.749 --> 22:43.710
So I thought about it
long and hard,

22:43.753 --> 22:48.236
and I come to the conclusion
that in some ways, she's right.

22:48.279 --> 22:51.370
Right that we have
an obligation,

22:51.413 --> 22:53.328
especially during these days,

22:53.372 --> 22:56.026
to show the public
we hear their concerns.

22:56.070 --> 22:59.682
For we're only as strong
as our weakest link.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.554
I'm glad to see you
coming around.

23:01.597 --> 23:04.426
But the truth is

23:04.470 --> 23:06.863
that taking away his bar

23:06.907 --> 23:09.126
will not make him a better

23:09.170 --> 23:12.129
or stronger cop.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.610
It'll only make him
a bitter cop.

23:14.654 --> 23:19.267
Bitter because him and
everybody else is gonna know

23:19.310 --> 23:23.140
that we only did it to make
an example out of him.

23:23.184 --> 23:25.229
Look, how many times are we
gonna use this excuse?

23:25.273 --> 23:26.709
GORMLEY: I talked to
Lieutenant Stoltz.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.799
He checked himself into rehab
on his own dime.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.062
The fact that he had to
put himself in rehab

23:32.106 --> 23:33.716
speaks volumes.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.762
And he didn't have to,
he just did.

23:35.805 --> 23:38.460
And it speaks volumes
about the man's character

23:38.504 --> 23:40.897
that he checked himself in
voluntarily.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.943
If all we do is
give him a slap on the wrist,

23:42.986 --> 23:45.772
the public will view this
for what it is.

23:45.815 --> 23:48.339
It's cops giving
fellow cops a break.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.037
A break that they themselves

23:50.080 --> 23:51.865
would probably not receive.

23:51.908 --> 23:55.477
Boss, all I'm saying is
let not the court

23:55.521 --> 23:59.916
of public opinion be
the highest court in the land.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.887
[sighs]
Under advisement.

24:28.031 --> 24:30.469
That was really something, Sid.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.645
Dare I say inspiring?

24:32.688 --> 24:34.342
Downright moving,
and I am not kidding,

24:34.385 --> 24:35.735
not even a little.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.214
It was a nice presentation,
Lieutenant.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.521
Thoughtful and compelling.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.131
I appreciate that.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.307
But after the bloom
comes off that rose,

24:43.351 --> 24:45.962
does the commissioner
start to wonder why

24:46.006 --> 24:47.573
it's taken you so long

24:47.616 --> 24:49.618
to do your job the way
it should be done?

24:49.662 --> 24:52.360
Drilled down
and thought through.

25:04.241 --> 25:06.200
I got your email.

25:06.243 --> 25:08.898
The defendant wanting to
plead guilty to the charge

25:08.942 --> 25:10.204
with time served.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.293
Yep. It's a great deal, right?

25:12.336 --> 25:14.034
I want more.

25:14.077 --> 25:16.732
Uh, well, with all due respect,

25:16.776 --> 25:18.560
this-this is a great outcome.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.040
We-we should take it.

25:20.083 --> 25:22.608
I want more.

Right. [nervous chuckle]

25:40.277 --> 25:41.583
Um... [clears throat]
I just--

25:41.627 --> 25:44.020
I'm sorry, I have to ask,
do you...

25:44.064 --> 25:46.501
do you have something

DANNY [on video]:
...business owners, huh?

26:03.692 --> 26:05.433
[speaking Vietnamese]What?

26:05.476 --> 26:07.435
BAEZ: I think that means he
doesn't speak any English.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.263
No, I said...

26:09.306 --> 26:12.614
Why do you keep watching that
over and over again?

26:12.658 --> 26:14.050
I'm looking for something.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.574
What?
I don't know.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.923
Whatever we missed.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.446
Whatever little thing it was

26:18.489 --> 26:21.405
that slipped through
the cracks in the box.

26:21.449 --> 26:24.931
Hello, Daniel.What do you want?

26:24.974 --> 26:26.585
Excuse me?

26:26.628 --> 26:28.456
That's what you say whenever
I enter your office.

26:28.499 --> 26:29.762
So, what do you want?

26:29.805 --> 26:32.721
Maybe she just stopped
by to say hello.

26:32.765 --> 26:35.332
Yeah, maybe I just
stopped by to say hello.

26:35.376 --> 26:38.771
Right. Like it wasn't you
who crashed your Datsun

26:38.814 --> 26:41.512
into my '70 Camaro
back in high school.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.471
Oh, my Lord, when are you
gonna get over that?

26:43.514 --> 26:44.646
It wasn't me.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.778
You were the only person

26:45.821 --> 26:47.344
parked directly in front of me.

26:47.388 --> 26:48.955
How do you drive
with this guy?

26:48.998 --> 26:51.087
I say a novena every morning.

26:53.263 --> 26:54.221
Don't worry,
I didn't tell anyone

26:54.264 --> 26:55.875
about your bumper sticker.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.659
Oh, what bumper sticker?

26:57.703 --> 26:59.922
[sighs]Now you can move on
to the next person

26:59.966 --> 27:01.881
on your list;
uh, Francis X. Reagan.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.535
His office is a few
blocks away, if you dare.

27:04.579 --> 27:06.842
That's not why I'm here,
thank you very much.

27:06.886 --> 27:08.452
Then why are you here?

27:08.496 --> 27:11.499
Does the name Marshall
Clearwater ring a bell?

27:11.542 --> 27:13.370
He was collared for possession,
and the D.A.

27:13.414 --> 27:14.981
wants me to look into it.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.678
Uh-huh. Possession?

27:16.722 --> 27:18.506
Don't get me started, okay?

27:18.549 --> 27:21.291
Anyway, Eddie's got a friend
in the adjacent precinct

27:21.335 --> 27:23.032
who says my guy Marshall
has got a cousin

27:23.076 --> 27:25.644
who's a heavy hitter,
and you collared him.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.689
He ran the, um,
Ludlow Street Syndicate.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.343
Does it ring any bells?

27:29.386 --> 27:30.910
DANNY: [on video]:
...business owners, huh?

27:30.953 --> 27:32.955
[speaking Vietnamese]What?

27:32.999 --> 27:35.349
BAEZ [on video]:
I think that means
he doesn't speak any English.

27:35.392 --> 27:36.829
SONNY [on video]:
No, I said...

27:36.872 --> 27:39.396
[speaks Vietnamese]

27:39.440 --> 27:40.876
Google it.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.531
I'll look into that.
We gotta go.

27:43.574 --> 27:44.750
We do?Yeah.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.055
Come on.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.929
See ya.
ERIN:
Uh...

27:50.930 --> 27:53.149
Hey, so you really
didn't say anything

27:53.193 --> 27:54.585
about that bumper sticker?

27:54.629 --> 27:56.631
I knew it.
I knew it.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.678
I'm really happy I smashed
that stupid Camaro.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.549
I knew that, too.Yeah.

28:05.205 --> 28:08.382
Hi, yo, Detective, you get
that Secret Santa gift?

28:08.425 --> 28:10.732
Yeah. Too bad it was garbage.Your new BFF?

28:10.776 --> 28:12.995
"You can kiss my skinny ass."

28:13.039 --> 28:14.736
You can go straight
to HR.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.565
Not you. That's what he said
to me in Vietnamese

28:17.608 --> 28:19.349
in the box, which
gave me this idea.

28:19.393 --> 28:20.873
Am I supposed to know
what that means?

28:20.916 --> 28:22.701
Just go along with the plan.

28:28.924 --> 28:30.883
We are very busy.
Can't talk right now.I understand.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.059
We just have
a few more questions.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.582
I'm trying to
put this behind me.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.671
You being here is only
gonna make things worse.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.848

28:41.371 --> 28:43.591
See? You already make it worse.

28:43.634 --> 28:45.767
We understand you're frustrated.

28:45.811 --> 28:47.682
Look, we think someone
either picked the lock

28:47.726 --> 28:49.945
or had a key;
we spoke to your landlord.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.642
You talk to landlord?
Oh, no.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.166
You just create more trouble.

28:53.209 --> 28:55.298
Not if you just
work with us.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.344
[speaking Vietnamese]

29:05.178 --> 29:07.963
You're making my wife upset.
Please leave.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.443
Mr. Pham...I said go!

29:09.486 --> 29:11.097
There's nothing else! Go!

29:11.140 --> 29:13.534
Okay. Okay.Go! Leave. Leave!

29:18.800 --> 29:20.280
That was fun.

29:20.323 --> 29:22.151
I just love being
yelled at in a foreign tongue

29:22.195 --> 29:23.979
and getting kicked out
of places.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.328
You did great.

29:25.372 --> 29:26.721
Well, wish I could
say the same.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.201
Any reason why
you kept your mouth shut?

29:28.244 --> 29:29.593
Yeah.

29:29.637 --> 29:32.379
[Bao's wife speaking Vietnamese]

29:34.337 --> 29:35.991
Oh, great, you recorded it

29:36.035 --> 29:37.732
so I could relive the torture.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.430
Mm-hmm. Except now in English.

29:40.474 --> 29:41.780
English?

29:41.823 --> 29:42.955
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Just tell him who did it,

29:42.998 --> 29:44.173
you stubborn old man.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.958
Just tell him who did it,

29:46.001 --> 29:47.829
you stubborn old man.

29:47.873 --> 29:51.050
It's a translation app.
Sometimes I'm actually smart.

29:51.093 --> 29:52.834
When you're not being stupid.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.736
What am I doing here?

30:25.780 --> 30:28.348
Just a quick follow-up.
Got a few more questions.

30:28.391 --> 30:29.697
Yeah, I already told you

30:29.740 --> 30:31.481
everything I know
about the gang.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.179
Which I didn't have to do,
by the way, that was a favor.

30:33.222 --> 30:34.833
And I appreciate that.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.878
But I wanted to make sure you
didn't leave anything out.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.140
I didn't.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.794
Um, I think you did.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.101
Okay, like what?

30:42.144 --> 30:45.452
Like the fact that you are
Bao and Linh Pham's son.

30:45.495 --> 30:49.151
Like the fact that you have
a serious gambling problem.

30:49.195 --> 30:50.892
Everybody gambles
in Little Vietnam.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.372
It's a cultural thing.

30:52.415 --> 30:54.896
But not everybody owes
their bookie $20,000

30:54.940 --> 30:58.160
and suddenly has the debt gone
just a few days later.

30:58.204 --> 31:01.294
Just a few days after
their parents' store was robbed.

31:01.337 --> 31:02.861
I didn't rob my parents' store.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.471
No, you robbed
your parents' store

31:04.514 --> 31:05.907
and beat your own father
over the head.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.213
That's a lie.

31:07.256 --> 31:08.997
Well, I'm not the one
who said it.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.694
What are you talking about?

31:13.088 --> 31:14.873
Who's behind there?
What are you looking at?

31:18.528 --> 31:20.966
What kind of person
steals from their parents

31:21.009 --> 31:22.271
and beats up their own father?

31:22.315 --> 31:24.056
I didn't do it.
It wasn't me.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.709
Mm.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.019
Yes, you did.Dad.

31:31.063 --> 31:32.629
No, don't do this.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.066
Do you have any idea
what's gonna happen to me?

31:34.109 --> 31:37.939
What should have happened
a long time ago.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.552
[both speaking Vietnamese]

31:45.120 --> 31:46.165
Ba!

31:48.863 --> 31:50.734
On your feet.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.874
Do you have
something for me?

31:59.918 --> 32:03.051
I give you... more.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.885
These are new charges
against the defendant.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.321
Felony charges.

32:12.365 --> 32:14.976
It turns out the defendant
is much more than

32:15.020 --> 32:17.544
just a guy possessing
a small amount of drugs.

32:17.587 --> 32:19.720
He's actually the heir apparent.

32:19.763 --> 32:21.374
To?

32:21.417 --> 32:23.332
To the Ludlow Street Syndicate,
run by his cousin,

32:23.376 --> 32:27.119
who was sent away last month
for the next ten years.

32:27.162 --> 32:30.774
We believe the defendant
is now running the operation.

32:30.818 --> 32:34.387
I would say that definitely
qualifies as more.

32:35.388 --> 32:38.043
But you already
knew that, right?

32:38.086 --> 32:39.870
Me?

32:39.914 --> 32:42.569
You gave me
this small case because

32:42.612 --> 32:44.788
you knew it wasn't small.

32:44.832 --> 32:46.965
I had a hunch,

32:47.008 --> 32:49.054
so I wanted my best person
on it.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.622
Thank you for that.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.973
Thank you for this.

33:01.066 --> 33:03.111
♪ More, more, more

33:03.155 --> 33:05.896

How do you like it? ♪

33:05.940 --> 33:07.246
[laughs]

33:10.423 --> 33:12.381
There is no right decision,

33:12.425 --> 33:14.340
there's only the decision itself

33:14.383 --> 33:17.169
and the willingness to accept
its consequences.

33:17.212 --> 33:21.042
These guy have heard a version
of that a hundred times.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.523
More like a million,
but who's counting?

33:27.048 --> 33:30.051
I'm the boss, I'm the one who
has to make those decisions,

33:30.095 --> 33:32.271
then live with them.

33:32.314 --> 33:33.620
Understood.

33:33.663 --> 33:34.708
Detective Reddick,

33:34.751 --> 33:37.276
you made a compelling argument

33:37.319 --> 33:39.452
for busting him down
to patrol.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.584
I appreciate you hearing
me out on the issue,

33:41.628 --> 33:44.413
and even considering
my point of view.

33:44.457 --> 33:47.590
Well, I've done more than that.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.115
I don't get it.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.379
He's going your way.

33:53.422 --> 33:55.076
Seriously?

33:55.120 --> 33:57.296
Not quite.
I'm taking his bar

33:57.339 --> 33:59.341
and busting him down
to sergeant.

33:59.385 --> 34:00.429
Boss?

34:00.473 --> 34:02.649
Sid, the case you made

34:02.692 --> 34:04.433
for Lieutenant Stoltz

34:04.477 --> 34:06.957
reminded me of why I brought you
up here in the first place.

34:08.611 --> 34:10.352
So thank you.

34:12.180 --> 34:15.314
And, Detective Reddick,

34:15.357 --> 34:17.533
you did good work.

34:17.577 --> 34:20.319
Thank you.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.495
I think you made
the right decision.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.627
Really?

34:24.671 --> 34:27.761
Sorry.
There is no right decision.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.287
It could easily have gone
the other way.

34:32.331 --> 34:33.767
I understand.

34:33.810 --> 34:36.552
[sighs]

34:36.596 --> 34:38.815
I hope you do.

34:41.340 --> 34:44.125
What is this?

34:44.169 --> 34:46.171
[exhales]

34:48.216 --> 34:49.565
You're transferring me?

34:52.264 --> 34:53.874
It's an open transfer.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.571
You can fill in the bureau.

34:55.615 --> 34:57.704
I thought you just said
I was doing good work.

34:57.747 --> 34:59.488
I did.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.142
Then what's the problem?

35:01.186 --> 35:02.752
There isn't one.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.232
I don't understand.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.539
Well, look, what you did here
in one week

35:06.582 --> 35:08.062
was pretty remarkable,

35:08.106 --> 35:10.195
and you brought out the best
in my team.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.806
I'm still waiting for the part
where I screwed up.

35:12.849 --> 35:16.723
Well, the fact that you didn't
is what focused me.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.855
Sir...

35:18.899 --> 35:21.728
Well, look... [sighs]

35:21.771 --> 35:24.513
We're far from perfect up here,

35:24.557 --> 35:26.733
but we're angels
compared to the devils

35:26.776 --> 35:29.344
out there on the street.

35:31.477 --> 35:34.262
I can't waste you up here

35:34.306 --> 35:37.135
when I could have you
working out there.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.972
Do good work, come back safe.

35:54.282 --> 35:56.284
Yes, sir.

36:05.859 --> 36:07.208
[door opens]

36:08.688 --> 36:10.429
[door closes]

36:40.981 --> 36:42.635
Ever see the movie
The Godfather?

36:42.678 --> 36:45.115
"Leave the gun,
take the cannoli."
Good line.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.292
A lot of good lessons
in that movie, too.

36:47.335 --> 36:49.642
Never speak outside
the family.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.600
That's a good one.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.080
Even though you're
named Sonny,

36:53.123 --> 36:54.255
you might want to take
a few more lessons

36:54.299 --> 36:55.648
from Michael, though.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.694
Like Michael wanted
to get out of crime,

36:58.738 --> 37:01.741
take the family business legit.

37:01.784 --> 37:03.873
Easier for him than me.

37:03.917 --> 37:07.094
Yeah. But you're smart
like Michael was.

37:07.137 --> 37:10.489
And, like Michael,
you're cursed...

37:10.532 --> 37:13.666
with big balls, but a heart
that's in the right place.

37:13.709 --> 37:16.059
That's why these knuckleheads
will do anything for you.

37:16.103 --> 37:18.410
And I'll do anything for them.Of course you will.

37:18.453 --> 37:21.108
It's because
you're a good leader.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.284
Because of that,
you don't have to

37:23.328 --> 37:26.809
build your business
down here in the street.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.159
You could build it up in
one of those high-rises.

37:29.203 --> 37:32.946
Or you could work with me.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.384
Think about it.

37:51.747 --> 37:54.707
[sighs sharply]

38:00.365 --> 38:02.236
What's wrong with me, Anthony?

38:02.280 --> 38:05.283
Oh, so, so many things.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.414
I'm being serious.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.720
Yeah, so am I.

38:07.763 --> 38:10.418
[sighs]Oh, come on!

38:10.462 --> 38:12.551
I'm just kidding.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.901
There's practically nothing
wrong with you.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.511
Practically?

38:17.512 --> 38:18.992
Your feet.

38:20.515 --> 38:21.908
They're a little big for me.

38:21.951 --> 38:23.301
Wh... What?

38:23.344 --> 38:24.563
Oh, come on,
would you knock it off?

38:24.606 --> 38:26.216
There's nothing wrong with you.

38:26.260 --> 38:29.959
Then why do I always
assume the worst in people?

38:30.003 --> 38:31.831
You don't.I do.

38:31.874 --> 38:35.269
The D.A. put me on this case
'cause she thinks I'm the best.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.140
I thought it was
to put me in my place,

38:37.184 --> 38:40.361
which actually just
makes me the worst.

38:40.405 --> 38:42.145
No, it makes you human.

38:42.189 --> 38:44.409
Something that you Reagans have
a hard time swallowing.

38:44.452 --> 38:46.715
I know I'm human, Anthony.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.543
Yeah, but you don't like it.

38:48.587 --> 38:50.632
You think it's like
any other weakness.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.155
Something you could rise above

38:52.199 --> 38:54.549
if you really, really
put your mind to it.

38:58.466 --> 39:00.990
Crawford knows I don't like her,

39:01.034 --> 39:03.079
and yet she regards me highly.

39:03.123 --> 39:04.907
She-she respects me.

39:04.951 --> 39:07.127
So what's your point?

39:07.170 --> 39:09.259
What makes me think

39:09.303 --> 39:12.524
I should replace her as D.A.?

39:18.181 --> 39:19.835
Nothing to see here.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.097
Night, Sid.

39:21.141 --> 39:22.664
Good night, fatso.

39:22.708 --> 39:25.145
[laughs]

39:25.188 --> 39:28.235
They got no offense, and
they got even less defense.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.671
Mark my words,

39:29.715 --> 39:32.326
come the playoffs,
they're the team to beat.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.937
Playoffs?
That's a fantasy.

39:34.981 --> 39:36.461
Yeah, I don't know, Pops.

39:36.504 --> 39:39.594
Oh, ye of so little faith.

39:39.638 --> 39:42.423
Just for the record,
I'm out.

39:44.207 --> 39:45.861
You're out?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.429
Out of what?

39:49.909 --> 39:51.432
I'm not running.

39:51.476 --> 39:54.043
Like for a marathon?

39:54.087 --> 39:56.437
No, not for, like, a marathon.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.961
Like, I'm not running
for the D.A.'s job.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.746
Any particular reason?

40:00.789 --> 40:04.010
It's just not for me
right now, that's all.

40:04.053 --> 40:05.881
I see.

40:07.143 --> 40:08.971
So this has nothing
to do with...Nope.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.495
Nothing to do
with anything.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.540
Just a personal choice.

40:12.584 --> 40:14.281
So it was just a coincidence
that you were running around

40:14.324 --> 40:17.763
paranoid that one of us blabbed
about your bumper sticker,

40:17.806 --> 40:19.417
and now you're cutting bait?

40:19.460 --> 40:22.550
Sometimes a cigar is
just a cigar, Danny.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.465
Hmm. Okay.

40:24.509 --> 40:28.730
Sometimes it's a lot more
than a cigar.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.340
Mm.

40:30.384 --> 40:33.082
Pop, am I the only one
missing something here?

40:33.126 --> 40:36.042
Not a clue.
Lost in the dark here.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.264
It's a long story
with no point, Dad.

40:41.308 --> 40:44.224
I love long stories
with no point.

40:44.267 --> 40:46.400
I just don't want to do it.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.271
Can't that just be enough?

40:48.315 --> 40:50.186
It can be...

40:50.230 --> 40:51.971
if that's how you really feel.

40:52.014 --> 40:55.235
Well, it is,
so that's that.

40:55.278 --> 40:57.411
My two cents?

40:57.455 --> 40:59.935
How did I know that
"that's that"

40:59.979 --> 41:01.589
was not going to be
that's that?

41:01.633 --> 41:02.982
It's never that.

41:03.025 --> 41:06.376
Sometimes an emphatic no
is the last step

41:06.420 --> 41:09.597
you have to take before
jumping in with two feet.

41:16.038 --> 41:18.780
Something to think about.

41:20.608 --> 41:23.437
And Pop's right, but not only
will they make the playoffs,

41:23.481 --> 41:25.308
they will run the table.

41:25.352 --> 41:26.440
DANNY: What?!JANKO: That's the spirit!

41:26.484 --> 41:27.746
You're crazy.

41:27.789 --> 41:29.530
They have no shot.He's delusional.

41:29.574 --> 41:31.053
It could happen.

41:31.097 --> 41:32.751
No, no, it couldn't.

41:32.794 --> 41:34.100
HENRY:
The man knows what
he's talking about.

41:34.143 --> 41:36.450
No shot.No, it couldn't.

41:36.494 --> 41:38.060
DANNY:
He's delusional
and you're delusional.

41:38.104 --> 41:40.367
HENRY:
No, sir!And you're delusional, too.
