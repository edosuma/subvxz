00:01.152 --> 00:03.802
<i>Previously on Ghost Whisperer.</i>

00:04.488 --> 00:07.407
<i>- What?
- It"s just a weird day.</i>

00:07.408 --> 00:09.576
Can't shake this feeling
of dread, you know,

00:09.577 --> 00:10.869
like something terrible
is gonna happen.

00:10.870 --> 00:12.495
- Have you had this before?
- No.

00:12.496 --> 00:13.788
We're close.

00:13.789 --> 00:14.998
<i>A uniform?</i>

00:14.999 --> 00:16.458
I think he was a pilot.

00:16.459 --> 00:17.667
What's wrong?

00:17.668 --> 00:19.544
My brother is supposed to fly today.

00:19.545 --> 00:21.463
Andrea, what are the chances?

00:21.464 --> 00:23.381
Melinda, this is Charlie Filbert,

00:23.382 --> 00:24.716
the architect that
I was telling you about.

00:24.717 --> 00:25.842
Nice to meet you, Charlie.

00:25.843 --> 00:27.010
So, you guys want to expand?

00:27.011 --> 00:28.803
- Yes.
- Maybe.

00:28.804 --> 00:30.763
I'm gonna have to call you back.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.265
What are you looking for?

00:32.266 --> 00:33.641
Did an aeroplane crash?

00:33.642 --> 00:36.311
I don't know yet. We're still flying.

00:36.312 --> 00:38.104
What?

00:38.105 --> 00:41.649
<i>Yes, hello. There is a plane in the air.</i>

00:41.650 --> 00:43.151
No one is flying it.

00:43.152 --> 00:45.652
Get off the square!

00:49.199 --> 00:51.617
Melinda.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.703
I was driving, and I saw it.

00:53.704 --> 00:55.037
<i>It went down.</i>

00:55.038 --> 00:56.205
<i>Cars everywhere.</i>

00:56.206 --> 00:58.499
<i>It was terrible.</i>

00:58.500 --> 01:01.000
<i>You"re the one.</i>

Move that fire away!

01:45.297 --> 01:49.977
- You okay?
- Don't worry about me, Jim. I'm good.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.823
...sweetie, and hear my wife's call.

02:12.824 --> 02:14.199
Can somebody help us?

02:14.200 --> 02:15.993
Can you help me sir?
I'm looking for my brother.

02:15.994 --> 02:19.955
- Somebody please help.
- Please, what's going on?

02:19.956 --> 02:21.373
Steven!

02:21.374 --> 02:22.833
Kristen!

02:22.834 --> 02:24.334
Kim, where are you?

02:24.335 --> 02:26.835
Kristen!

02:31.259 --> 02:33.010
Have you seen my brother?

02:33.011 --> 02:37.511
I was sitting right beside him.
Right over there.

02:40.351 --> 02:42.851
Sir, can you help me?

02:43.771 --> 02:47.023
Look, you have to listen to me.
It's not good for you to stay here.

02:47.024 --> 02:50.527
They don't believe you.
We can't be dead.

02:50.528 --> 02:52.696
Will you look around?

02:52.697 --> 02:55.991
You have to understand
what happened here.

02:55.992 --> 02:58.159
I don't know what anything is any more.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.660
Do you see a light?

03:01.038 --> 03:02.205
What if I do?

03:02.206 --> 03:03.915
Then you have to get
your passengers together

03:03.916 --> 03:05.208
and you have to go into that light.

03:05.209 --> 03:07.335
- It's where you belong.
- Not yet.

03:07.336 --> 03:10.776
Not until we figure out what happened.

03:41.203 --> 03:43.703
You okay?

03:43.872 --> 03:45.748
I don't know.

03:45.749 --> 03:50.459
I just want to find someone,
just one person alive.

03:51.505 --> 03:54.005
There's still time.

03:56.593 --> 03:59.512
- How's the new guy doing?
- He's hanging in there.

03:59.513 --> 04:02.423
A little green around the gills.

04:03.892 --> 04:06.477
I mean, is it me? Maybe there's
something wrong with me

04:06.478 --> 04:08.354
that I can do this without flinching.

04:08.355 --> 04:11.715
Hey, there is nothing wrong with you.

04:12.025 --> 04:17.605
You just know how to keep going.
That's what they need here.

04:17.656 --> 04:21.096
- Well, I better do that, huh?
- Hey.

04:29.459 --> 04:30.960
Check in with me later?

04:30.961 --> 04:33.551
- I love you.
- I love you.

04:35.924 --> 04:37.883
Kristen!

04:37.884 --> 04:40.428
Where are we? No one will tell us!

04:40.429 --> 04:42.929
Kristen!

04:54.401 --> 04:56.901
Kristen!

05:01.324 --> 05:03.824
She can see us.

05:05.370 --> 05:07.204
Help me find my son.

05:07.205 --> 05:09.705
She can see us?

05:21.136 --> 05:23.636
Please help us.

05:25.431 --> 05:27.015
What should we do?

05:27.016 --> 05:29.516
Have you seen my family?

05:39.195 --> 05:41.695
<i>Can you see us?</i>

06:17.599 --> 06:19.850
Have you seen Kristen?

06:19.851 --> 06:22.351
She's only 10.

06:22.395 --> 06:24.521
I don't know Kristen.

06:24.522 --> 06:26.773
She's my daughter.

06:26.774 --> 06:30.652
We have to be getting home.
My husband's waiting.

06:30.653 --> 06:32.195
What's your name?

06:32.196 --> 06:34.614
My name is Lisa.

06:34.615 --> 06:38.715
- Have you seen her?
- I'll look. I promise.

06:40.621 --> 06:43.501
You don't look like the others.

06:44.125 --> 06:47.325
Do you remember it being very cold?

06:47.462 --> 06:49.962
Who are they?

07:10.484 --> 07:13.737
<i>The flight, which originated
in Johannesburg, South Africa,</i>

07:13.738 --> 07:17.282
<i>stopped reporting its position
somewhere over the Atlantic.</i>

07:17.283 --> 07:19.868
<i>Several attempts were made
to contact this flight</i>

07:19.869 --> 07:22.829
<i>which carried 248 passengers
and crew.</i>

07:22.830 --> 07:24.414
<i>They all failed.</i>

07:24.415 --> 07:26.332
<i>As the plane
approached the East Coast,</i>

07:26.333 --> 07:28.126
<i>jet fighters were scrambled.</i>

07:28.127 --> 07:32.088
<i>They reported all the cabin windows
were frosted over.</i>

07:32.089 --> 07:37.329
<i>The plane then went
into a steep descent and went down...</i>

07:40.347 --> 07:41.723
Enough.

07:41.724 --> 07:44.183
I still haven't heard from my brother.

07:44.184 --> 07:46.694
He was in Cape Town, but...

07:46.937 --> 07:49.605
He said he might spend a couple
of days in Johannesburg.

07:49.606 --> 07:51.357
When was he coming back?

07:51.358 --> 07:53.735
He was supposed to be back last night.

07:53.736 --> 07:56.654
You know, I really don't get the feeling
that he was on that flight.

07:56.655 --> 07:57.947
I mean, what are the chances?

07:57.948 --> 08:02.160
I can't lose my brother, Melinda.
I can't sleep. I keep...

08:02.161 --> 08:06.211
Just sitting on the couch
and staring and...

08:07.541 --> 08:09.542
Yeah, Andrea,
I know that you're worried,

08:09.543 --> 08:12.837
but you might have to face something.

08:12.838 --> 08:14.839
Excuse me. Melinda Gordon?

08:14.840 --> 08:16.132
That's me.

08:16.133 --> 08:17.675
My name is Matt Mallinson.

08:17.676 --> 08:21.095
I'm the investigator in charge with the
National Transportation Safety Board.

08:21.096 --> 08:22.430
How can I help you?

08:22.431 --> 08:24.682
Well, our records show
that several calls

08:24.683 --> 08:26.559
were placed from this store to the FAA,

08:26.560 --> 08:30.104
and local airports yesterday
just before the crash.

08:30.105 --> 08:32.063
I made some of those calls, too.

08:32.065 --> 08:35.025
Did you make some of those calls,
Miss Gordon?

08:35.025 --> 08:37.936
Warning about a plane in danger?

08:39.405 --> 08:41.532
- Yes.
- Well, the thing of it is,

08:41.533 --> 08:45.536
those calls were placed nearly a half
hour before the media was notified,

08:45.537 --> 08:51.067
and, well, we'd like to know where
you got your information.

08:52.043 --> 08:55.045
Well, it was it was a feeling, really.

08:55.046 --> 08:57.632
- Intuition.
- Intuition.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.341
"There's a plane in the air.

08:59.342 --> 09:02.720
"The pilot, Ken Nilsen, is dead.
Maybe the crew.

09:02.721 --> 09:04.471
"No one is flying it."

09:04.472 --> 09:07.766
That's pretty specific intuition,
don't you think?

09:07.767 --> 09:10.269
Look, I know this is
probably bad timing,

09:10.270 --> 09:13.188
but I really need to know
if my brother was on that plane,

09:13.189 --> 09:15.315
and maybe you have
a passenger manifest.

09:15.316 --> 09:16.775
His name is Mitchell Moreno.

09:16.776 --> 09:19.611
Yeah, has a passengers list
been released yet?

09:19.612 --> 09:22.948
No, not publicly.
The families are still being notified.

09:22.949 --> 09:27.202
We'd like to know how you knew
these things, Miss Gordon.

09:27.203 --> 09:29.703
Was the pilot dead?

09:35.503 --> 09:40.053
Yes, Mallinson.
Yeah, I can be there in about 10.

09:40.466 --> 09:43.969
We're gonna have to schedule
a formal interview, and you can...

09:43.970 --> 09:46.470
You can expect a call.

09:51.686 --> 09:55.647
- They have transcripts of the calls.
- How did he leave it?

09:55.648 --> 09:59.317
I'm supposed to go in for a formal
statement, whatever that means.

09:59.318 --> 10:00.777
Honey, this is the government.

10:00.778 --> 10:02.612
They're not gonna be
open-minded about this.

10:02.613 --> 10:05.407
It's only gonna get worse
if I tell them the truth.

10:05.408 --> 10:10.728
Melinda, trust me.
Your truth is not gonna be their truth.

10:11.747 --> 10:15.166
Jim, there's a woman
looking for a little girl.

10:15.167 --> 10:18.837
A 10-year-old.
I don't know what she looks like.

10:18.838 --> 10:22.716
We haven't found any kids yet.
God, this is overwhelming.

10:22.717 --> 10:26.720
I've never seen anything like this.
I mean, just the scale.

10:26.721 --> 10:29.432
All these lives, gone.

10:29.515 --> 10:32.015
They all get through it.

10:33.144 --> 10:35.644
We'll get through it.

10:36.313 --> 10:38.813
I should go.

10:40.234 --> 10:42.734
You know?

10:42.903 --> 10:45.071
- I get it now.
- What?

10:45.072 --> 10:49.200
What you said before.
About rushing through life.

10:49.201 --> 10:52.561
About not taking time for each other.

10:54.081 --> 10:56.831
When this is over, that stops.

11:00.295 --> 11:02.795
Yes, it does.

11:11.515 --> 11:13.224
Wait!

11:13.225 --> 11:15.725
<i>They"re mine.</i>

11:17.145 --> 11:21.665
Miss Gordon?
I'm gonna need you to come with me.

11:29.465 --> 11:32.175
Volunteers are not authorised
to go past the tape.

11:32.176 --> 11:34.469
It won't happen again.
I'm sorry. Can I go now?

11:34.470 --> 11:36.970
No.

11:37.390 --> 11:41.769
Miss Gordon,
at what point did you become aware

11:41.853 --> 11:44.730
that there was an aircraft in distress?

11:44.731 --> 11:46.940
It was more of a feeling I had.

11:46.941 --> 11:50.171
The valves. Find the outflow valves.

11:50.862 --> 11:52.112
You have to tell him.

11:52.113 --> 11:54.781
Yeah, all I can say is
it has something to do with valves.

11:54.782 --> 11:57.282
- Valves?
- Outflow valves.

11:57.493 --> 11:59.870
Yeah, the outflow valves.

11:59.871 --> 12:02.914
If you find them,
you'll understand more.

12:02.915 --> 12:04.624
And where did you get
this information?

12:04.625 --> 12:05.792
I'd rather not say.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.168
I can't leave my ship.

12:07.169 --> 12:08.962
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

12:08.963 --> 12:10.088
What you're doing with my wife?

12:10.089 --> 12:12.090
Asking your wife
a few questions, Mr Clancy.

12:12.091 --> 12:14.134
That's funny,
I don't remember telling you my name.

12:14.135 --> 12:15.885
You didn't.

12:15.886 --> 12:17.595
You can't hold her here like this.

12:17.596 --> 12:22.142
No, you're right, I can't,
but law enforcement can.

12:22.143 --> 12:24.643
But they won't for now.

12:25.688 --> 12:30.108
Miss Gordon.
Don't cross that yellow tape again.

12:57.052 --> 12:59.772
I saw them take my body away.

13:00.305 --> 13:02.975
Yes. I'm sorry.

13:03.809 --> 13:07.559
I'm just not ready. I don't have anyone.

13:08.605 --> 13:11.105
No husband, no kids.

13:11.150 --> 13:13.568
I wanted to stay single
so that I could travel,

13:13.569 --> 13:15.403
see everything there is to see.

13:15.404 --> 13:18.031
- Did you?
- Not enough.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.659
And now that's it?
I don't get another chance?

13:21.660 --> 13:23.911
Not here, anyway.

13:23.912 --> 13:27.999
I don't know why I'm dead.
I don't know what happened.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.461
You have to cross over into the light.
You have to tell the passengers.

13:32.462 --> 13:36.215
We're not crossing over.
He said we didn't have to.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.800
He made promises.

13:37.801 --> 13:40.094
He said we can stay here
with the others.

13:40.095 --> 13:41.846
Who?

13:41.847 --> 13:45.015
The one with the hat.
He came out of the woods.

13:45.016 --> 13:48.185
- What did he say?
- He said to stay away from the light.

13:48.186 --> 13:51.188
That there were things
that we could do here for him.

13:51.189 --> 13:54.400
He said we could stay forever
if we wanted.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.811
I'm staying, and so is everyone else.

14:07.288 --> 14:10.416
I just need 15 minutes up there.
I won't disturb anything.

14:10.417 --> 14:14.169
I need some answers, Miss Gordon.
How did you know about this flight

14:14.170 --> 14:18.340
- and who told you about the valves?
- The pilot.

14:18.341 --> 14:20.426
- The pilot's dead.
- I know.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.261
But last night
he was standing in front of you,

14:22.262 --> 14:23.971
and he was trying to tell you
to check the valves.

14:23.972 --> 14:25.222
Told me instead.

14:25.223 --> 14:29.351
- You claim to be a psychic?
- No. Psychics see the future.

14:29.352 --> 14:32.712
- Well, what do you see?
- The dead.

14:33.731 --> 14:35.482
Are you registered?

14:35.483 --> 14:37.818
- What?
- NSA, CIA.

14:37.819 --> 14:40.696
I was registered
at the Pottery Barn when I got married.

14:40.697 --> 14:41.863
That's about it.

14:41.864 --> 14:47.104
Well, do you think you're gonna get
any more information?

14:47.537 --> 14:51.397
- Is this a joke?
- When I joke, I smile.

14:51.624 --> 14:55.774
Maybe.
If you let me back on the crash site.

14:56.254 --> 14:59.404
- You got 15 minutes.
- Thank you.

15:20.111 --> 15:22.822
Reggie. I know you.

15:22.947 --> 15:24.406
- Hey, come on, lady.
- Okay.

15:24.407 --> 15:26.616
Miss, please.

15:26.617 --> 15:28.368
Why are you here?

15:28.369 --> 15:31.859
To wait for the others from the plane.

15:31.997 --> 15:35.597
- For what?
- He wants us all together.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.171
- Who does?
- Him.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.842
<i>They"re mine.</i>

15:50.099 --> 15:52.599
Reggie.

15:53.852 --> 15:56.352
They're going with him.

16:02.852 --> 16:04.853
They're making a mistake.

16:04.854 --> 16:07.272
He told them
they could be with their families.

16:07.273 --> 16:09.399
Talk to them.

16:09.400 --> 16:14.820
- He told me I could see my little girl.
- No, he's lying.

16:14.989 --> 16:17.819
I've looked everywhere for her.

16:19.827 --> 16:22.707
- Is she dead?
- I don't know.

16:23.706 --> 16:27.406
I haven't seen a spirit of any children.

16:28.962 --> 16:31.462
Am I dead?

16:32.090 --> 16:34.590
Yes.

16:35.134 --> 16:36.843
But I didn't...

16:36.844 --> 16:39.344
I didn't feel anything.

16:39.555 --> 16:40.889
Is that all it takes?

16:40.890 --> 16:43.392
You can just die and not even feel it?
Not even know it?

16:43.393 --> 16:46.312
Sometimes. But there's a reason.

16:46.395 --> 16:48.855
- Well, what?
- Well, we can't know that here.

16:48.856 --> 16:51.736
- But it's not fair.
- I know.

16:53.152 --> 16:55.403
Maybe then it's good
that I can't find her.

16:55.404 --> 16:58.284
Maybe it means she's all right.

16:58.908 --> 17:02.188
Where were you sitting on the plane?

17:02.662 --> 17:04.204
We weren't on the plane.

17:04.204 --> 17:06.080
What should we do
when we get home?

17:06.082 --> 17:07.707
I don't know. Play games.

17:07.708 --> 17:10.328
- Hang out with Dad?
- Yeah.

17:10.544 --> 17:13.044
What is that?

17:16.133 --> 17:18.259
What is it?

17:18.260 --> 17:20.261
What about my husband?

17:20.262 --> 17:23.852
He can't lose both of us. He needs us.

17:24.474 --> 17:27.727
I keep trying to let him know
that I'm looking for her.

17:27.728 --> 17:30.228
He can't hear you.

17:31.315 --> 17:33.815
But he can hear you.

17:34.068 --> 17:36.568
They can all hear you.

17:37.029 --> 17:39.529
I know.

18:22.783 --> 18:25.283
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:25.369 --> 18:27.869
Where have you been?

18:30.248 --> 18:32.838
I went to Mitch's apartment.

18:33.794 --> 18:38.604
He wasn't there.
No one would talk to me about him.

18:41.676 --> 18:45.262
Do you remember that fortune teller
at the carnival? She...

18:45.263 --> 18:48.390
She said something bad
was gonna happen around Mitch.

18:48.391 --> 18:50.351
She said that he might
get sick or something, but...

18:50.352 --> 18:53.232
What if this is what she meant?

18:54.064 --> 18:56.994
I think it's too early to tell.

18:58.652 --> 19:02.905
I've been trying
to work up the courage to go in there,

19:02.906 --> 19:04.990
look at the passenger list.

19:04.991 --> 19:07.491
Andrea.

19:07.911 --> 19:11.321
There's something I have to tell you.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.125
You saw Mitch?

19:16.127 --> 19:17.419
- Andrea...
- Don't.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.920
No. No.

19:20.006 --> 19:24.286
- But I'm not sure...
- No way. It's not him.

19:32.894 --> 19:35.520
Good evening.
My name is Matthew Mallinson.

19:35.521 --> 19:37.564
I'm with the
National Transportation Safety Board.

19:37.565 --> 19:41.443
I'll be giving you updates
throughout the night.

19:41.444 --> 19:43.944
While the search continues,

19:43.988 --> 19:49.648
I have to report that no survivors
have been found as of yet.

19:52.079 --> 19:56.583
Though it is still, technically,
a search-and-rescue operation,

19:56.584 --> 20:01.254
but I have to report
that sometime in the next few hours...

20:01.255 --> 20:02.923
Isabelle, I'm here. I'm right here.

20:02.924 --> 20:05.717
...search-and-recover operation...

20:05.718 --> 20:06.885
I love you.

20:06.886 --> 20:09.179
I miss him so much. Don't cry.

20:09.180 --> 20:11.473
- Can you hear me?
- I'm okay.

20:11.474 --> 20:16.394
And, please, let any of us know
if you need anything.

20:17.897 --> 20:20.397
Thank you.

20:35.206 --> 20:37.706
I'm not involved in this.

20:37.958 --> 20:40.458
Not in any official way.

20:41.462 --> 20:45.562
I'm just someone who lives here.
Works here.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.763
I just wanted to
tell you all how sorry I am.

20:51.764 --> 20:55.266
How sorry we all are
here in Grandview.

20:55.267 --> 20:58.019
Don't worry, sweetie,
I'm right here with you, every minute.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.610
I also wanted to tell you...

21:01.565 --> 21:03.900
To make you understand if I can,

21:03.901 --> 21:07.821
that your loved ones, they feel you.

21:08.572 --> 21:10.031
Remember me.

21:10.032 --> 21:12.542
They know that you're here.

21:12.618 --> 21:15.628
I've been to the crash site, and

21:16.496 --> 21:18.996
felt their spirits there.

21:19.625 --> 21:21.459
- And I can...
- Listen to me.

21:21.460 --> 21:25.080
I can feel them right now in this room.

21:25.130 --> 21:29.260
I feel their sadness.
I feel their confusión.

21:31.803 --> 21:35.765
But the biggest thing
that I feel is their love.

21:35.766 --> 21:38.266
- For you.
- It's okay.

21:38.852 --> 21:42.438
And if there is anything that
they would want you to know,

21:42.439 --> 21:46.299
is that they know
how much you love them.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.690
That is so important for you to know.

21:56.286 --> 21:59.326
It's the only thing that matters.

22:20.393 --> 22:22.060
Sir, do you need to see the manifest?

22:22.061 --> 22:25.772
My wife's not on the manifest.
She wasn't on an aeroplane.

22:25.773 --> 22:29.953
She was coming down from
my sister's upstate.

22:53.801 --> 22:56.301
<i>They"re mine.</i>

22:57.555 --> 23:00.055
<i>Well?</i>

23:00.308 --> 23:04.978
You can't do this. You can't trick
those souls into staying here.

23:04.979 --> 23:07.397
<i>Since you feel so strongly about it,</i>

23:07.398 --> 23:11.152
<i>I will release all your precious souls</i>

23:11.611 --> 23:13.737
<i>and let you send them into the light,</i>

23:13.738 --> 23:16.238
<i>and in return,</i>

23:16.991 --> 23:19.491
<i>l"ll taKe you.</i>

23:27.442 --> 23:28.692
Who the hell is this guy?

23:28.693 --> 23:31.195
I don't know, I've been noticing him
for the last few months.

23:31.196 --> 23:32.988
There's two of them.
One who laughs and this one.

23:32.989 --> 23:35.074
- They're dead?
- They're spirits, yeah.

23:35.075 --> 23:36.450
Well, why didn't you tell me about this?

23:36.451 --> 23:38.077
Tell you what?
I don't know who they are.

23:38.078 --> 23:39.578
I just know that they're bad news.

23:39.579 --> 23:42.873
That's the understatement of the year.
This one guy wants you dead, right?

23:42.874 --> 23:45.459
He wants my soul in return for theirs.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.586
Why would my one soul
be worth hundreds?

23:47.587 --> 23:50.422
It's obvious. He wants to stop you
crossing people over.

23:50.423 --> 23:52.923
Why?

23:54.969 --> 23:58.597
And I've been having these dreams
and seeing these signs,

23:58.598 --> 24:03.227
and they all say the same thing.
"You're the one."

24:03.228 --> 24:04.645
What if this is what that means?

24:04.646 --> 24:06.063
No. No, it doesn't.

24:06.064 --> 24:08.065
Well, what if I'm supposed
to save these souls?

24:08.066 --> 24:10.400
What if none of this is random
and that's why I'm here?

24:10.401 --> 24:12.277
I mean, maybe this is what
it's all been leading up to.

24:12.278 --> 24:14.946
No, this is nuts! Listen to yourself.

24:14.947 --> 24:17.447
It was 250 people, Jim.

24:17.950 --> 24:19.493
Do I really have the right
to ignore that?

24:19.494 --> 24:22.621
What about the thousands of people
you could help the rest of your life?

24:22.622 --> 24:24.289
Do you have the right to ignore them?

24:24.290 --> 24:26.416
No. That's what this guy is afraid of.

24:26.417 --> 24:28.835
That's what he wants to stop.
What about that?

24:28.836 --> 24:32.296
We lost so much in the last few days.

24:34.175 --> 24:36.675
I know.

24:36.719 --> 24:39.219
Too much. Too many.

24:39.472 --> 24:41.723
But I'm not losing you.

24:41.724 --> 24:44.477
Not now. Not ever.

24:48.939 --> 24:52.509
- Did you tell Andrea?
- I just can't.

25:01.202 --> 25:03.702
It's the government guy.

25:10.169 --> 25:14.589
This is the air outflow valve.
They found it about two hours ago.

25:14.590 --> 25:19.260
Mean my job
if anybody knew I brought this to you.

25:19.261 --> 25:21.761
Then why did you?

25:22.556 --> 25:25.056
Oh, you know why.

25:33.484 --> 25:35.984
Ask him to turn it for me.

25:38.655 --> 25:40.656
He wants you to turn it for him.

25:40.657 --> 25:43.157
All right.

25:43.660 --> 25:46.160
How's that?

25:47.414 --> 25:50.904
It's closed. It should have been open.

25:51.001 --> 25:53.377
It was my fault.

25:53.378 --> 25:56.578
- He thinks it's his fault.
- How?

25:56.590 --> 25:58.883
I must have missed it.

25:58.884 --> 26:01.927
<i>L"ve done thousands of
pre-flight checKs, never a problem.</i>

26:01.928 --> 26:04.138
<i>I did a checK
of the whole oxygen system,</i>

26:04.139 --> 26:06.098
<i>and a closed valve
should have been obvious.</i>

26:06.099 --> 26:08.517
<i>We were over the ocean
at 35,000 feet,</i>

26:08.518 --> 26:11.268
<i>and then all hell broKe loose.</i>

26:14.566 --> 26:16.108
<i>We lost cabin pressure.</i>

26:16.109 --> 26:20.070
<i>When that happens, you have to get
oxygen flowing immediately.</i>

26:20.071 --> 26:22.656
<i>But with the valve closed,
there was nothing flowing.</i>

26:22.657 --> 26:25.451
<i>By the time I stood up,
I started getting disoriented.</i>

26:25.452 --> 26:27.077
<i>The whole crew was getting confused.</i>

26:27.078 --> 26:30.038
It's cold, please open the door!

26:30.290 --> 26:32.207
<i>I Knew I had to checK
the outflow valve,</i>

26:32.208 --> 26:36.068
<i>but with no oxygen,
I just went to sleep.</i>

26:42.761 --> 26:47.421
<i>When I woKe up, everyone around me
was unconscious.</i>

26:54.689 --> 26:58.949
<i>With no air flow,
everyone just went to sleep.</i>

26:59.194 --> 27:04.064
<i>There was nothing I could do
except watch them sleep.</i>

27:07.493 --> 27:14.291
<i>And wait for them to die one by one.
Wait for it to become a ghost flight.</i>

27:14.292 --> 27:16.752
It was my fault.

27:16.753 --> 27:19.129
And that's all he knows.

27:19.130 --> 27:21.340
He's telling you that right now?

27:21.341 --> 27:22.966
Does it make any sense?

27:22.967 --> 27:24.634
Yeah, it does. It's called hypoxia.

27:24.635 --> 27:26.511
At that altitude
when the cabin loses pressure,

27:26.512 --> 27:30.182
you've only got about 20 seconds
before your brain starts to shut down.

27:30.183 --> 27:34.363
And you get confused,
and you can't function.

27:34.562 --> 27:37.522
Do you want to ask him anything?

27:38.649 --> 27:42.862
No. That's... That's all for now.
Thank you.

27:46.449 --> 27:47.991
I can't believe this.

27:47.992 --> 27:50.577
Could I have
just one more chance to do it again?

27:50.578 --> 27:54.706
- To check those valves by hand.
- I wish you could.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.708
I just can't believe it's all over.

27:56.709 --> 27:58.335
My wife is sick.

27:58.336 --> 28:02.964
I only took this run for the insurance,
for the hours.

28:02.965 --> 28:07.177
There are so many people
who don't know that I love them.

28:07.178 --> 28:10.298
They may know more than you think.

28:11.474 --> 28:14.225
Right now you have to tell
your passengers what happened.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.393
Oh, I can't.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.520
- Why?
- It was my mistake.

28:17.521 --> 28:21.232
- It cost them their lives.
- None of that matters right now.

28:21.233 --> 28:22.984
We may not all know why we die,

28:22.985 --> 28:27.113
but everybody deserves to know
how they died.

28:27.114 --> 28:31.794
And you have to tell them,
so they can cross over.

28:40.335 --> 28:42.835
Mommy.

28:42.963 --> 28:46.533
Shut up!
Shut up, shut up, guys! Whoa!

28:51.305 --> 28:53.805
Sorry. Never mind.

28:55.976 --> 28:57.560
My mommy's hurt.

28:57.561 --> 29:00.281
Whoa, we got one. We got one!

29:04.776 --> 29:07.276
A little help, John.

29:11.074 --> 29:13.574
We got somebody.

29:14.494 --> 29:16.328
- Help.
- I'm right here, honey. It's all right.

29:16.329 --> 29:18.829
Hey, you're gonna be okay.

29:21.877 --> 29:24.377
Please.

29:33.437 --> 29:34.938
Help my mommy.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.898
It's okay, honey.

29:36.899 --> 29:38.858
Go look around the other side.

29:38.859 --> 29:40.777
- Move the body.
- All right.

29:40.778 --> 29:42.153
Please.

29:42.154 --> 29:44.030
I'm gonna take the girl on this side.

29:44.031 --> 29:45.907
- Go, go, go, go!
- Will, give me a board.

29:45.908 --> 29:48.408
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:52.915 --> 29:56.695
It's a little tight at first. Easy. Easy.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.300
Okay. All right.

30:07.471 --> 30:09.180
All right.

30:09.181 --> 30:10.556
Get her feet.

30:10.557 --> 30:12.141
Will, you got the board?

30:12.142 --> 30:14.642
Okay.

30:18.732 --> 30:20.650
One, two, three.

30:20.651 --> 30:23.151
We got her. We got her.

30:41.380 --> 30:43.880
You did all right.

30:48.387 --> 30:51.667
Please, you have to tell my husband.

30:53.308 --> 30:56.428
There are things he needs to know.

30:56.770 --> 30:58.354
What things?

30:58.355 --> 31:00.606
They said she's stable.

31:00.607 --> 31:03.107
Had hardly a mark on her.

31:04.569 --> 31:08.299
They found my wife's body
covering hers.

31:11.368 --> 31:14.248
I saw you at the family centre.

31:14.454 --> 31:16.038
It helped, what you said.

31:16.039 --> 31:18.539
I'm glad, Charlie.

31:18.625 --> 31:21.125
You know things we don't.

31:21.878 --> 31:24.963
I know that your wife
has a message for you.

31:24.964 --> 31:26.215
And for Kristen, too.

31:26.216 --> 31:29.176
- I don't understand.
- I've seen her.

31:29.177 --> 31:33.138
At the crash site,
she was looking for Kristen.

31:33.139 --> 31:35.516
She was there
when they found her body,

31:35.517 --> 31:37.559
and she's with her right now.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.060
Hey.

31:40.897 --> 31:45.692
- What are you saying?
- You have to listen to me, Charlie.

31:45.693 --> 31:49.279
She has some journals.
They're in the bedroom closet

31:49.280 --> 31:52.282
on the top shelf way in the back.

31:52.283 --> 31:54.701
There's a lot of them.

31:54.702 --> 31:57.996
She started writing them
when she was Kristen's age.

31:57.997 --> 32:00.874
Everything that happened to her,
everything that she felt.

32:00.875 --> 32:06.380
The last entry was the day before
she and Kristen left for their trip.

32:06.381 --> 32:12.677
She wants you to give them to Kristen,
one every year until she grows up.

32:12.678 --> 32:15.096
And she wants you both to cry.

32:15.097 --> 32:19.726
To let it out, and not hold
anything back from each other.

32:19.727 --> 32:22.145
You have to be Kristen's rock now.

32:22.146 --> 32:25.482
- What if I can't?
- She knows that you're afraid.

32:25.483 --> 32:28.735
But she believes
that this is the way it's supposed to be.

32:28.736 --> 32:31.236
She's counting on you.

32:34.575 --> 32:39.735
She said goodbye to Kristen.
She's gonna cross over now.

32:47.963 --> 32:51.613
- Tell her I can feel her.
- She knows.

32:57.556 --> 32:58.765
I better go.

32:58.766 --> 33:02.416
Please, I want you
to meet my daughter.

33:06.023 --> 33:08.984
Hey, sweetie. You feeling better?

33:09.526 --> 33:10.693
Good.

33:10.694 --> 33:13.905
This is Melinda Gordon.
Her husband found you.

33:13.906 --> 33:17.426
- And Mom, too?
- Yeah. Your mom, too.

33:17.576 --> 33:20.620
I know my mom's gonna be all right.

33:20.621 --> 33:23.121
How do you know that?

33:23.207 --> 33:25.707
The same way I know you.

33:26.877 --> 33:30.506
- Me?
- I saw you in my dream.

33:33.759 --> 33:37.199
- What was your dream?
- I saw light.

33:37.804 --> 33:39.513
<i>Really bright.</i>

33:39.514 --> 33:43.142
And then,
this really nice man came to me.

33:43.143 --> 33:45.728
I heard his voice in my head.

33:45.729 --> 33:48.689
<i>He said he was a guardian spirit</i>

33:48.732 --> 33:52.234
<i>and his job was to taKe care
of children liKe me.</i>

33:52.235 --> 33:54.735
He had to send me back.

33:54.946 --> 33:57.156
He said that it wasn't my time yet

33:57.157 --> 33:59.408
but I had to give
a message to someone.

33:59.409 --> 34:01.702
Who?

34:01.703 --> 34:04.203
He showed me you.

34:05.582 --> 34:07.249
Did he say anything else?

34:07.250 --> 34:11.337
He told me to tell you
that someone bad was here.

34:11.338 --> 34:13.838
He said...

34:16.717 --> 34:20.137
He said that
he has to be stopped by you.

34:20.138 --> 34:23.641
He said that you are the one.

34:31.940 --> 34:35.860
It was my fault!
Everything I've just told you

34:35.862 --> 34:39.656
happened because
I forgot something very important

34:39.657 --> 34:41.824
in the pre-flight check.

34:41.826 --> 34:46.456
I can tell you
that you all just went to sleep.

34:46.539 --> 34:49.949
There was no pain, no panic, no fear.

34:59.135 --> 35:02.304
I know that this
is really hard for all of you.

35:02.305 --> 35:03.680
You need peace now,

35:03.681 --> 35:06.433
and the best thing for you to do
is just to go into the light.

35:06.434 --> 35:08.934
<i>Really?</i>

35:09.479 --> 35:11.979
<i>I beg to differ.</i>

35:13.733 --> 35:15.942
<i>You can all stay right here.</i>

35:15.943 --> 35:18.903
Yes, you can, but you shouldn't.

35:19.113 --> 35:21.114
There's nothing here for you any more.

35:21.115 --> 35:23.615
That's a lie!

35:26.621 --> 35:29.121
Your families are here.

35:29.165 --> 35:31.665
Your friends.

35:32.210 --> 35:34.502
Your homes.

35:34.503 --> 35:36.004
No one knows what's on the other side.

35:36.005 --> 35:37.756
Why take that chance?

35:37.757 --> 35:40.592
You are all meant to move on.
That's why you died.

35:40.593 --> 35:42.844
You died because the plane crashed.

35:42.845 --> 35:47.140
- The right thing to do is to cross over.
- The right thing.

35:47.141 --> 35:51.081
How many of you
have done the right thing?

35:52.480 --> 35:54.980
You.

35:56.567 --> 35:58.276
Your wife is dying, isn't she?

35:58.277 --> 36:00.528
You didn't take this job
because you needed the hours.

36:00.529 --> 36:01.696
You took this job

36:01.697 --> 36:04.574
because you hated to see her sick,
to see her suffer.

36:04.575 --> 36:07.855
Because you just needed to get away.

36:07.912 --> 36:10.412
Don't feel so bad.

36:10.497 --> 36:16.187
I've done terrible things, too.
Things you can't even imagine.

36:17.254 --> 36:19.754
Just look around you.

36:23.594 --> 36:26.204
All in a day's work for me.

36:26.346 --> 36:30.683
What if the only things waiting for you
on the other side of that light

36:30.684 --> 36:32.935
are judgement and punishment?

36:32.936 --> 36:35.772
What's waiting there
is peace and forgiveness.

36:35.773 --> 36:38.273
Really? Have you been?

36:40.444 --> 36:43.363
No, but I know it's true.

36:47.701 --> 36:50.201
Wait a minute. No.

36:50.454 --> 36:52.954
Wait a minute!

36:53.373 --> 36:55.791
I've devoted my life to this.

36:55.792 --> 36:57.960
My grandmother
devoted her life to this.

36:57.961 --> 37:01.241
I've crossed over hundreds of souls.

37:01.506 --> 37:03.382
And, no, maybe...

37:03.383 --> 37:05.634
Maybe I don't know
what's behind the light,

37:05.635 --> 37:09.638
but I... I have seen the faces
of the people that I've crossed over.

37:09.639 --> 37:13.017
I've seen their eyes and their smiles.

37:13.018 --> 37:17.828
I've seen them weep for joy.
I've felt their peace.

37:18.064 --> 37:22.443
You just have to have a little faith.
It's that simple.

37:22.444 --> 37:24.944
You're not alone.

37:25.280 --> 37:26.864
And all of this was meant to be,

37:26.865 --> 37:30.909
and the only thing that I know for sure
is that there is love there.

37:30.910 --> 37:33.996
Love like you have never known here,

37:33.997 --> 37:37.617
and you can't just turn away from that.

37:43.298 --> 37:45.549
Do you see it?

37:45.550 --> 37:48.050
Why can I see that?

37:48.052 --> 37:50.552
I don't know.

37:50.555 --> 37:55.934
Maybe there are so many souls that
we're all meant to see it.

37:55.935 --> 38:00.689
The people that you love
are waiting for you over there,

38:00.690 --> 38:04.401
and they won't let
anything bad happen to you.

38:04.402 --> 38:07.113
Just please look and see it.

38:24.422 --> 38:26.922
Okay.

38:26.924 --> 38:28.550
Come one, let's leave.

38:28.551 --> 38:31.051
Okay.

38:37.685 --> 38:40.897
- Yes.
- Walk towards the light.

38:43.941 --> 38:48.231
Walk towards the light.
Walk towards the light.

38:54.368 --> 38:56.868
Hey. Hey.

38:57.830 --> 38:59.080
Good to see you.

38:59.081 --> 39:01.581
Here, come here.

40:10.444 --> 40:12.653
Are they all gone?

40:12.654 --> 40:15.324
No, some of them are staying.

40:43.643 --> 40:46.396
Hey. You all right?

40:46.563 --> 40:48.397
I'm a little better.

40:48.398 --> 40:52.109
I'm just... I'm so relieved
that you didn't see Mitch crossing over.

40:52.110 --> 40:57.010
You know, maybe...
Maybe he's just stranded somewhere.

41:06.791 --> 41:11.211
Andrea, there's something
that you have to know.

41:12.046 --> 41:16.466
Something that I've been
trying to find a way to tell you.

41:16.467 --> 41:18.967
You did see Mitch.

41:19.095 --> 41:21.595
He's here.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.309
- Where?
- Outside.

41:30.356 --> 41:32.856
Mitch!

41:38.406 --> 41:40.906
I'm so sorry, Mitch.

41:41.325 --> 41:43.493
Mitch?

41:43.494 --> 41:46.580
I was supposed to be
on that plane, Melinda.

41:46.581 --> 41:49.958
I took a later flight,
but we got diverted to Boston.

41:49.959 --> 41:53.461
- You got my message?
- Not till this morning.

41:53.462 --> 41:57.372
I rented a car and drove until I got here.

41:58.801 --> 42:01.301
How'd it happen?

42:03.431 --> 42:07.691
She was driving
to your apartment in the city.

42:08.644 --> 42:11.524
She tried so hard to reach you.

42:12.773 --> 42:17.663
I guess her car got caught
in the path of the plane.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.863
No.

42:19.864 --> 42:22.323
Do you think she suffered?

42:22.324 --> 42:24.824
No.

42:26.996 --> 42:29.496
No, I don't think so.

42:30.082 --> 42:35.822
My whole drive here I kept reaching for
the phone to call her.

42:40.384 --> 42:45.888
I can't believe she's not up there
safe and sound in her apartment.

42:45.889 --> 42:48.389
Tell me this isn't true.

42:52.688 --> 42:55.188
I'm so sorry.

42:58.235 --> 43:00.735
I tried to tell you,

43:01.154 --> 43:04.115
but I didn't want to let you go.

43:04.116 --> 43:09.296
I kept thinking it was a dream
and I was gonna wake up.

43:14.751 --> 43:17.251
This can't be happening.

43:17.337 --> 43:20.347
I'm falling in love with a poet.

43:25.679 --> 43:28.189
It's my brother's birthday.

43:36.523 --> 43:38.857
She wanted you to have this

43:38.858 --> 43:41.358
for your birthday.
