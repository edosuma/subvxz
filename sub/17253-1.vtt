WEBVTT

03:22.224 --> 03:26.937
It's the big house on the left.
"Casa de Porter"!

03:47.499 --> 03:49.043
Hello?

04:51.814 --> 04:53.899
See ya, Porter!

04:59.238 --> 05:02.825
Just the one.
It's not five o'clock yet.

05:07.079 --> 05:11.500
I beg your pardon, little pig.
What d'ya say?

05:12.626 --> 05:15.921
Sandy? - Yep.
- Thought you were comin' Thursday.

05:16.338 --> 05:19.550
It is Thursday.
- Looks like I missed your boat.

05:21.010 --> 05:24.096
Oon't worry, buddy,
Uncle Paul will make it up to you.

05:24.513 --> 05:28.684
What is this place anyway?
- It was an abandoned fishing camp.

05:29.101 --> 05:33.147
It was a real dump when I got here.

05:35.941 --> 05:37.484
Come aboard, I'll show you around.

05:38.485 --> 05:39.945
Hey! Heel!

05:40.613 --> 05:41.614
Here, boy.

05:45.075 --> 05:46.577
We're in the poo, mate.

06:00.674 --> 06:04.011
You like spaghetti this much?
- I'm quite a bargain hunter.

06:04.428 --> 06:09.475
When the cruise ships are in the area,
you can do some terrific deals.

06:09.934 --> 06:14.688
Any passengers that want Spaghetti-os
are out of luck.

06:15.814 --> 06:17.149
I'm sure.

06:17.566 --> 06:20.903
They're not exactly Omaha steaks,
but you won't go hungry.

06:23.322 --> 06:28.452
There's gotta be some mistake.
You cannot be my uncle.

06:30.371 --> 06:34.542
You know they say: You can choose
your friends, but not your relatives.

06:37.253 --> 06:40.464
Why don't you unpack?
I'll rustle us up some grub.

06:40.881 --> 06:43.926
How much did she pay you
to take me off her hands?

06:46.470 --> 06:50.224
I resent that. When your mother
called, I didn't hesitate.

06:50.641 --> 06:53.018
If anyone
knows about divorce, it's me.

06:53.477 --> 06:55.938
I mean, family's very important.

06:56.939 --> 06:59.608
You guys are all I've got.

07:00.025 --> 07:01.026
How much?

07:06.866 --> 07:10.035
A hundred dollars a week.
Just for the summer.

07:11.161 --> 07:13.706
Oh boy, she really low-balled ya.

07:15.291 --> 07:16.292
Story of my life, kid.

07:18.669 --> 07:20.629
This concert's history.

07:40.733 --> 07:43.110
All aboard!

07:46.572 --> 07:49.116
Come on, sailor! Shake a leg!

07:49.575 --> 07:53.078
You don't get up, you don't eat.
Time to rock and roll!

07:57.708 --> 08:02.296
Spaghetti-os with or without?
- Without what? - Pee-wee franks.

08:05.049 --> 08:06.800
Suit yourself.

08:07.551 --> 08:09.303
But out on the ocean,

08:11.096 --> 08:13.474
you can't order a pizza.

08:17.228 --> 08:18.729
You ever been fishing?

08:22.858 --> 08:26.779
What d'ya catch? - A whale.
But I threw it back.

08:28.030 --> 08:32.201
Most people think fishing's
a bamboo pole and a 6-pack of suds.

08:32.618 --> 08:34.995
But it's tougher than that.
- Oh really.

08:35.412 --> 08:37.456
What about seasickness?

08:39.332 --> 08:41.293
Look, I can handle it.

08:53.848 --> 08:55.975
Sure ya can.

09:14.493 --> 09:15.744
Where's the bait, sailor?

09:16.370 --> 09:18.414
Bait my butt!

09:37.892 --> 09:39.226
You okay?

10:12.801 --> 10:14.428
At least it floats!

10:14.845 --> 10:17.723
Funny. Buck-faced wombat!

10:21.393 --> 10:26.023
Just keep your eyes on the horizon.
- For how long?

10:26.440 --> 10:28.651
As long as it takes to keep it down.

10:47.670 --> 10:50.130
Oamn dolphins stealing all the bait.
- They're scaring the fish away.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.369
That's not fishing, kid.
That's murder.

12:02.786 --> 12:03.954
It's pathetic.

12:27.853 --> 12:29.438
Hey, kid!

12:31.190 --> 12:32.858
You see where that dolphin went?

12:36.445 --> 12:37.446
Yeah.

12:40.115 --> 12:41.116
That way.

12:45.162 --> 12:46.163
You sure?

12:59.844 --> 13:00.928
Alright, Oirk!

13:01.345 --> 13:03.055
Come on!

13:10.145 --> 13:11.397
Go on, get outta here!

13:13.607 --> 13:15.109
Go on. Go!

13:21.156 --> 13:22.241
Go!

13:49.476 --> 13:54.273
You gonna be at this concert?
- The Chili Peppers are mine!

13:54.732 --> 13:57.026
You're splitting?
- Am I splitting!

14:02.656 --> 14:03.657
Hey, Tommy.

14:04.116 --> 14:06.118
You returning to the mainland?

14:06.535 --> 14:10.289
I can't make it with no fish.
Fish are gone, I'm gone.

14:11.123 --> 14:13.834
What, you givin' up the good life?

14:14.251 --> 14:18.005
Good life's ancient history. I can't
feed a cat with what I catch.

14:20.299 --> 14:21.550
Oon't worry.

14:22.092 --> 14:26.096
I'm on the 5 A.M. Ferry.
Pick me up, we'll be at the concert.

14:26.972 --> 14:28.599
Gotta go, it's the hippy!

14:29.433 --> 14:34.188
Thought you might
like a change. - Why?

14:36.649 --> 14:37.650
I dunno.

14:41.820 --> 14:42.988
Yo, Marvin!

14:44.490 --> 14:46.200
Aren't you a bit warm?

14:50.704 --> 14:53.791
What's with him?
- Marvin's a little shy.

14:54.208 --> 14:59.421
Give him a spring and a wire,
he'll make an outboard motor.

15:02.967 --> 15:05.511
I don't want to hurt him.
- But sweetheart...

15:06.971 --> 15:10.391
Okay, we'll put him back
in with his friends,

15:11.475 --> 15:14.395
and we'll use this guy.
He won't mind at all.

15:14.812 --> 15:17.022
Have fun fishing!
- Okay.

15:17.481 --> 15:20.526
Become a marine biologist
and you can bait hooks too...

15:21.235 --> 15:23.988
In Boston you wouldn't get to see me.

15:24.405 --> 15:27.366
Just my luck.
This must be Sandy.

15:27.783 --> 15:30.661
Hi, I'm Cathy.
He probably told you about me.

15:31.620 --> 15:32.997
No.

15:34.498 --> 15:36.166
Can you get my stuff?

15:40.462 --> 15:45.259
So, how's he doing?
- Like a pizza, but upside down.

15:45.718 --> 15:50.681
I'll straighten him out.
You cooking dinner tonight?

15:51.098 --> 15:53.225
Why? You tired of Spaghetti-o's?

16:14.246 --> 16:16.624
You heard Tommy's leaving the island.

16:17.082 --> 16:19.960
We haven't had a decent catch
since spring. - I know why.

16:20.377 --> 16:23.714
The fish are loaded with dioxin.

16:24.131 --> 16:27.801
What's dioxin?
- It's a by-product of herbicide.

16:28.219 --> 16:30.095
How's that getting in our water?

16:31.263 --> 16:32.264
Careful!

16:38.395 --> 16:41.148
Will he ever take off that raincoat?

16:41.565 --> 16:44.818
Maybe we could get it cleaned
with him still inside.

16:45.236 --> 16:47.279
You never take me seriously!

16:47.696 --> 16:50.950
That's not fair!
Hit me with your best shot.

16:52.535 --> 16:53.702
When are we getting married?

17:01.043 --> 17:03.128
Gotta go fix the net.
- Porter Ricks!

17:10.803 --> 17:13.347
Think he'll ever grow up?

19:25.604 --> 19:27.398
What are you doing?

19:34.780 --> 19:37.533
Hey, Sandy. Oo I look cool or what?

19:37.950 --> 19:38.951
Or what.

19:39.910 --> 19:44.957
It's the shirt. It was given to me
by Brian Wilson. - Who?

19:45.833 --> 19:50.212
Brian Wilson. Beach Boys.
What are they teaching you kids?

19:52.798 --> 19:55.259
I'm tired. Gonna hit the hay early.

19:55.676 --> 19:58.137
Good. Cathy's number's on the wall.

19:58.596 --> 20:01.265
There's spaghetti if you're hungry...
- Yeah.

20:02.474 --> 20:04.476
I'm late. See ya in the A.M., kid.

20:05.227 --> 20:08.731
See ya in the A. M... not!

20:09.190 --> 20:11.233
FERRY OEPARTURES

20:41.055 --> 20:42.056
Hello?

22:14.231 --> 22:15.232
Is that you?

22:31.373 --> 22:32.374
Come on!

23:56.542 --> 23:57.710
Cool!

24:05.134 --> 24:07.344
Sorry. Gotta jet. See ya!

24:36.582 --> 24:40.002
Shake a leg, sailor!
You don't get up, you don't eat.

24:46.258 --> 24:47.259
Sandy?

24:52.515 --> 24:53.891
Earthquake!

25:00.022 --> 25:01.023
Jeez!

25:08.030 --> 25:10.491
Storm's comin'. Board up the windows.

25:10.950 --> 25:13.661
I can't, Russ.
Looking for a runaway nephew.

25:14.286 --> 25:17.623
Call off the search.
He took the first ferry out.

25:22.002 --> 25:26.632
By the way, I'll need $22.50.
He put it on your tab.

25:41.605 --> 25:42.690
He's so cute!

25:55.661 --> 25:59.498
Sandy?
I am by nature a gentle soul.

26:01.417 --> 26:04.920
However, I can crush a coconut...

26:05.379 --> 26:07.256
with my bare hands.

26:07.673 --> 26:10.968
Hold that thought
as we make our exit...

26:12.887 --> 26:14.263
with dignity.

26:39.914 --> 26:40.915
Get that rope!

26:45.044 --> 26:47.046
Sandy! Get the line!

27:16.575 --> 27:21.247
Oamn! Nice going, kid!
- You know what you just did?

27:21.664 --> 27:25.000
I probably saved your life.
- You made me blow Chili Peppers.

27:25.417 --> 27:29.755
Next concert's in Orlando.
I don't have tickets. - I don't give...

27:30.172 --> 27:34.260
Great! Bloody great.
"Yeah, I'd love to see Sandy.

27:35.678 --> 27:37.596
Send him down. It'll be great."

27:41.058 --> 27:44.645
Lt'll cost me
my house and my boat, but...

27:45.312 --> 27:48.315
I should give up
and join Tommy on the mainland.

27:49.066 --> 27:53.612
Why didn't you just let me go?
- I'm not finished with you yet.

27:54.613 --> 27:59.285
Oon't talk like my father.
I'm not looking for another father.

28:00.870 --> 28:01.871
Good.

28:02.830 --> 28:06.250
Make's us even.
'Cause I'm not looking for a son.

28:06.667 --> 28:08.961
Especially
a screw-up teenager like you.

28:10.629 --> 28:14.550
You don't know me.
You know nothing about me.

28:16.552 --> 28:19.013
Tell you what I do know, kid.

28:20.222 --> 28:22.516
This here is the earth.

28:22.975 --> 28:27.229
This is the great big ocean.
Here's our tiny island. Your mum

28:27.938 --> 28:29.106
is way over there.

28:31.233 --> 28:34.028
No matter how you scream,
she can't hear ya.

28:34.862 --> 28:40.075
You got no friends, no money,
no malls to hang around. You're stuck.

28:40.534 --> 28:42.828
All you have is me.

28:44.371 --> 28:46.290
So get used to it.

28:46.707 --> 28:51.504
And relax. Got a long, ugly
day ahead of us... and night.

28:54.590 --> 28:56.383
Gonna use that pillow?

28:59.303 --> 29:00.137
Thanks.

29:23.661 --> 29:26.205
He snored all bloody night!

29:37.258 --> 29:39.134
Oh man!

29:48.727 --> 29:50.813
Is nothing sacred?

29:56.360 --> 29:57.862
Jeez!

30:00.531 --> 30:02.116
Get off there!

30:14.128 --> 30:15.754
Look...

30:16.172 --> 30:19.925
Since I know you love being here,
I'll make a deal.

30:20.342 --> 30:23.679
You work for me,
help clean this mess up,

30:24.096 --> 30:26.390
and I'll get you
to that concert in Orlando.

30:27.975 --> 30:30.436
How?
I don't even have tickets.

30:30.853 --> 30:32.980
Kid, this is Porter Ricks.

30:33.439 --> 30:36.650
If it exists, I can get it.
We'll make that show.

30:37.067 --> 30:39.820
We?
- Think I'd let you go alone?

30:40.237 --> 30:44.867
Besides, I can dig the Chili Peppers.
Not the Beach Boys, but who is?

30:45.576 --> 30:46.994
Is it a deal?

31:01.258 --> 31:02.760
Haul her in!

31:04.136 --> 31:09.350
Start with the fish pan netting. Mast
and stuff's in the shed or in town.

31:09.808 --> 31:12.645
I'm gonna have to stay
with the boat on the mainland.

31:13.062 --> 31:15.606
You gonna be alright?
- I'll be fine.

31:19.151 --> 31:21.153
Cathy will drop in on you.

31:22.029 --> 31:25.449
You can reach me through
the coastguard station.

31:25.866 --> 31:28.160
But nothing's gonna happen, right?
- Right.

31:29.537 --> 31:30.538
Right.

32:29.346 --> 32:30.764
You...

36:36.093 --> 36:40.556
Like my dolphin?
- Your dolphin?

36:41.974 --> 36:45.477
That's right. I found him.

36:45.936 --> 36:47.771
What's his name?

36:53.694 --> 36:55.487
His name's Flipper.

36:57.656 --> 37:01.076
Never seen one alone like this.

37:02.244 --> 37:05.664
Alone he'd be no match for Scar.
- Who's Scar?

37:06.081 --> 37:09.251
The hammerhead that stalks
these waters. Big and ugly.

37:10.002 --> 37:15.049
They say he took out a tourist boat.
He likes those out-of-towners.

37:24.642 --> 37:27.436
That jerk tried to kill Flipper.

37:28.395 --> 37:30.606
He was shooting at him.

37:31.565 --> 37:34.443
That's Oirk Moran, a bottom-feeder.

37:36.737 --> 37:40.491
What are you doing?
- I'm hypnotizing him.

37:40.950 --> 37:42.535
It's not working.

37:44.537 --> 37:46.455
You make him do something.

37:49.750 --> 37:52.044
Okay. Sure.

37:54.088 --> 37:55.589
Alright.

37:56.632 --> 37:57.716
Alright, Flipper...

37:58.926 --> 38:01.011
What do you wanna do today?

38:10.145 --> 38:11.230
Jump!

38:18.696 --> 38:19.947
Awesome!

38:20.364 --> 38:23.242
You know...
- Where did he go?

38:45.806 --> 38:47.808
I'm Kim.
- Sandy.

38:51.270 --> 38:53.647
He's hungry.
- Really?

38:54.064 --> 38:57.276
Where d'you get fish to feed him?
- Feed him?

38:58.569 --> 39:01.906
He's your dolphin.
- Well, yeah...

39:03.449 --> 39:05.201
Come on, I got an idea.

39:18.714 --> 39:21.800
Lookin' good, Porter.
- Thanks.

39:23.427 --> 39:26.847
Oid most of it myself.
Most of it.

39:27.306 --> 39:29.308
Now I just have to pay for it.

39:29.725 --> 39:34.063
Take a lesson from your nephew.
He's becoming quite a businessman.

39:34.730 --> 39:37.525
What's he been up to?
- You'll see!

39:41.779 --> 39:46.825
Fish go in the bucket. One dollar
to see Flipper, the Wonder Oolphin.

39:50.913 --> 39:51.914
FLIPPER THE WONOER OOLPHIN

39:52.373 --> 39:55.334
One dollar. Oid you put your fish in?

39:55.751 --> 39:58.671
One dollar. In there. Wow!

39:59.088 --> 40:00.881
TOSS A QUARTER. FLIPPER RETURNS.

40:15.771 --> 40:18.566
OROP 25 CENTS HERE

40:21.652 --> 40:24.655
PENNIES

40:25.072 --> 40:28.117
Oon't ask me,
I can't explain how he does it.

40:31.453 --> 40:33.414
What's this, a penny?

40:33.831 --> 40:37.668
It's a Lincoln penny!
Vintage, man! Enjoy!

41:07.531 --> 41:10.326
Marvin! Come on in. No charge!

41:46.403 --> 41:49.657
1 dollar, thanks. Fish in the bucket.

41:50.074 --> 41:53.827
1 dollar, thanks.
Fish go in the bucket. Excuse me!

41:55.204 --> 41:57.206
You need a fish to get in.

41:57.623 --> 42:00.709
I don't have to pay, Kim.
I own this circus.

42:02.419 --> 42:04.713
What's going on here?
- Oh, hi!

42:05.172 --> 42:09.969
My best havanas! - It's the
Flipper Show! - Who's Flipper?

42:13.055 --> 42:16.976
Alright, the Flipper Show is over.
All you kids go home, now!

42:17.393 --> 42:19.770
Come on.
- Sorry.

42:20.187 --> 42:22.314
You can have your fish back.

42:22.731 --> 42:24.859
Give me my fish!
- Now!

42:26.360 --> 42:30.114
See ya, Sandy.
Go easy on him, Mr. Ricks.

42:32.199 --> 42:36.620
You were gonna fix the house!
- I did it so Flipper could eat.

42:37.037 --> 42:41.333
Who do you think you're dealing with?
You did it to turn some coin.

42:42.126 --> 42:45.421
I didn't do too bad
for myself either. Hey!

42:45.838 --> 42:49.258
Half cut!
As for you, you oversized guppy...

42:54.722 --> 42:56.557
I'll have to bring out the heavy guns.

43:06.817 --> 43:11.697
We're gonna try a new approach.
It's called "Oealing with your crap."

43:12.239 --> 43:14.366
This is how it works. Number 1:

43:14.783 --> 43:19.830
You're gonna take responsibility for
your actions and the consequences.

43:20.247 --> 43:23.375
Number 2: You're
gonna start getting up on time.

43:23.792 --> 43:26.504
And at work,
you're gonna hump, not gripe.

43:26.921 --> 43:31.133
You'll have to use your brain,
the weakest muscle in your body.

43:31.550 --> 43:33.219
And as fo the dolphin:

43:33.636 --> 43:39.058
If the damn thing won't go away,
you'll feed it. In your own time.

43:39.475 --> 43:41.602
And stand up straight!

43:42.061 --> 43:46.232
Oh, and you wanna be
a big man with a cigar, right?

43:47.608 --> 43:48.943
Fire up that puppy!

43:49.360 --> 43:53.113
Keep it stoked! From now on,
when I smoke, you smoke.

44:22.393 --> 44:25.479
Washed your hands? Sit down.

44:28.774 --> 44:29.775
Stogies down.

44:32.152 --> 44:33.320
Let's eat.

44:33.737 --> 44:38.367
Mom, when are you picking me up?
- In 2 weeks. What's in your mouth?

44:38.784 --> 44:40.995
Cigar.
- A what?

44:42.371 --> 44:46.208
I've been smokin' up a storm.
Uncle Porter lets me drink beer.

44:46.625 --> 44:50.462
He also knows a lot of
loose women. - Put your uncle on!

44:55.968 --> 44:59.638
Yeah, Porter.
- He can't smoke. He's just a kid!

45:00.055 --> 45:01.724
Hang on a sec, love...

45:05.477 --> 45:07.855
It's OK,
he' s about to kick the habit.

45:10.399 --> 45:11.942
Ready for another?

45:13.569 --> 45:16.197
Oh, please,
I'll never smoke again!

45:17.114 --> 45:20.701
Good. Now go and
take care of that poor little fish.

45:42.848 --> 45:44.850
Good boy. Thanks.

45:47.478 --> 45:50.981
Bring it to Sandy. Go on!

45:56.862 --> 45:58.447
Porter!

46:00.324 --> 46:04.787
I can't find Marvin anywhere.
I'm really worried. - Jump in.

46:09.625 --> 46:10.709
1 minute 20.

46:12.545 --> 46:13.546
Hey, Sandy!

46:15.464 --> 46:16.715
Marvin, what's up?

46:18.425 --> 46:19.677
Cool, huh?

46:21.428 --> 46:22.763
Come on down.

46:31.146 --> 46:34.650
Careful on the dock, Marv.
It's kinda slippery!

46:38.112 --> 46:40.489
Alright, Marv. Meet Flipper!

47:05.014 --> 47:07.099
Marvin!
- Flipper!

47:12.605 --> 47:15.065
Way to go, Marv!

47:26.952 --> 47:28.746
Are you guys telling secrets?

47:30.539 --> 47:34.293
We were wondering what the deal
is with you two? - What d'ya mean?

47:34.710 --> 47:38.005
You in for the long haul,
or is it just a fling?

47:40.424 --> 47:42.384
Sorry, is that the wrong question?

47:42.801 --> 47:47.056
Not at all, Sandy.
I'd be interested in the answer.

47:47.473 --> 47:49.517
Eat up, it's getting cold.

48:03.739 --> 48:05.574
Well, the gang's all here.

48:06.700 --> 48:09.453
Word has it you have a pet dolphin.

48:11.038 --> 48:13.165
I wouldn't call it a pet, Oirk.

48:13.582 --> 48:17.878
No? The way fishing's been,
we don't need a dolphin...

48:18.295 --> 48:21.674
to tear holes in nets and steal bait.

48:22.925 --> 48:24.969
But you know that, don't you?

48:25.386 --> 48:29.390
We're talking about one dolphin.
- You stay out of this.

48:30.266 --> 48:32.643
One dolphin is one too many.

48:40.234 --> 48:41.235
Bad smell around here.

48:45.072 --> 48:50.494
What's his problem? - He resents
anything smarter than he is.

48:50.911 --> 48:54.039
That includes about everything,
even these clams.

49:07.469 --> 49:09.013
Get him!
- Out of the way!

49:10.514 --> 49:13.684
What are you doing?
You're hurting him!

49:15.811 --> 49:16.812
That's enough!

49:17.605 --> 49:22.234
You've had your fun. Let him go.
- It's the Greenpeace Warrior!

49:26.071 --> 49:29.450
The animal means something
to the kid. - It does?

49:30.242 --> 49:33.454
Well, isn't that sweet?

49:33.871 --> 49:35.998
Isn't that sweet, boys?

49:36.415 --> 49:39.210
The kid and the fish are pals.

49:39.627 --> 49:42.379
I'd watch how I make friends.
- Enough!

49:53.432 --> 49:57.937
You got no right to do that.
I should teach you a lesson.

49:58.354 --> 50:00.481
Yeah, I'd like that.

50:00.898 --> 50:05.528
I have a thirst for knowledge.
Teach me.

50:13.077 --> 50:14.453
School's out, is it?

50:19.708 --> 50:21.168
Thought so.

50:21.585 --> 50:23.796
Maybe next time.

50:25.840 --> 50:28.801
You can count on it, Ricks!

50:36.934 --> 50:42.064
Good boy.
Come here, let me see those teeth.

50:48.362 --> 50:51.031
Here you go.
- That'll fit.

50:56.996 --> 50:58.622
Slow down!

51:04.461 --> 51:07.965
Hey, Buck, How are ya?
- Fine, and you?

51:08.382 --> 51:12.928
Pretty good. Bit of storm damage,
nothing we can't handle.

51:13.721 --> 51:16.849
Lucky dolphin! Gets the pro treatment.
- How are ya?

51:17.266 --> 51:21.562
Fine, except a little bird told me
you found yourselves this animal.

51:22.354 --> 51:24.648
Porter, you can't keep a dolphin.

51:25.065 --> 51:29.403
Here's the funny part: We're not
keeping it. He just stays.

51:29.820 --> 51:34.867
I tried to chase him away,
but he's taken a fancy to us.

51:35.326 --> 51:39.246
He's also harassing the fish.
- What? - We can't allow that.

51:39.705 --> 51:43.292
Who told you that?
- It doesn't matter.

51:43.709 --> 51:48.756
The law says, unless an animal's in
licensed captivity, he must be at sea.

51:52.468 --> 51:56.847
You're here to take him?
- You can't! He's used to being fed.

51:57.264 --> 51:59.808
That animal
can't fend for itself anymore.

52:01.060 --> 52:03.729
Help me out here, old buddy.

52:04.772 --> 52:08.776
They'll stick him in some
aquarium and revoke your license.

52:18.661 --> 52:22.831
Good boy. Easy now.

52:23.249 --> 52:25.709
Slow down, guys.

52:31.841 --> 52:34.218
You wanna come, or wait here?

52:38.514 --> 52:39.765
All set, Porter!

52:50.776 --> 52:52.278
Wait!

53:07.501 --> 53:09.503
It's okay.

53:16.927 --> 53:18.470
Good boy.

53:37.865 --> 53:41.202
Let him down slowly.
Easy, easy!

55:14.211 --> 55:16.297
Almost out of gas.

55:20.050 --> 55:21.886
It's cold.

55:28.809 --> 55:30.895
Here.
- Thanks.

56:01.133 --> 56:02.551
Jeez!

56:40.506 --> 56:42.258
Let's get outta here!

56:57.940 --> 57:00.150
Another day in paradise.

57:05.823 --> 57:07.867
You sleep here all night?

57:13.247 --> 57:16.417
I know you miss him.
He belongs out there.

57:18.878 --> 57:21.839
Things seem to mess up
when you care about them.

57:23.299 --> 57:26.802
It's like they say:
"To live is to love.

57:27.219 --> 57:31.140
All reason's against it,
all instinct's for it."

57:31.932 --> 57:35.227
What does that mean?
- I dunno. Read it on a calendar.

57:37.229 --> 57:42.693
It's good to care. People who don't
wind up drooling cream spinach.

57:54.580 --> 57:58.501
How come you don't have any kids?

58:02.046 --> 58:05.799
Kids require commitment.
That's not one of my strengths.

58:06.258 --> 58:09.220
If had a kid,
he'd might turn out like me.

58:10.971 --> 58:12.223
Might not be bad.

58:13.891 --> 58:17.728
He could turn out like you.
- Now that'd be a nightmare!

58:26.111 --> 58:28.155
Special delivery.

58:30.324 --> 58:31.909
I got us front and center.

58:34.119 --> 58:36.664
You're really going
to the concert? - Why not?

58:37.122 --> 58:40.292
I was grunge before they named it.

58:44.213 --> 58:47.800
Speakin' of grunge,
there's a load of dirty laundry

58:48.259 --> 58:51.053
with your name on it. Enjoy.

59:07.945 --> 59:08.946
What's the matter?

59:30.801 --> 59:32.052
What's wrong?

59:36.515 --> 59:40.519
Sandy, do something!
- Hold him up, don't let him sink.

59:47.610 --> 59:49.403
I'll be back.

59:49.820 --> 59:53.574
How are the kids?
- They're all fine.

59:54.241 --> 59:56.202
Come quick! He came back.

59:56.619 --> 59:58.829
I think he's dying.

01:00:07.004 --> 01:00:10.174
His breathing is shallow.
He's probably dehydrated.

01:00:11.884 --> 01:00:13.886
Who's for pizza?

01:00:16.931 --> 01:00:18.098
I see a dolphin.

01:00:18.557 --> 01:00:22.311
The only thing keeping him alive
is a strong will to live.

01:00:23.312 --> 01:00:25.981
Oo you have a blender?
- Pardon?

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.457
What is it?
- Kind of a dolphin shake.

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:48.587
An emergency supply of iron, protein,
calcium, bunch of other nutrients.

01:00:49.004 --> 01:00:52.758
Oo you have any Jell-O?
- Jell-O?

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:58.222
Marshmellow cream...

01:00:59.265 --> 01:01:00.266
Rancid...

01:01:02.601 --> 01:01:03.602
Oead...

01:01:04.937 --> 01:01:06.480
How about tropical punch?

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:21.203
Sorry.
- No problem, I got a handy vac.

01:01:29.545 --> 01:01:31.839
I've seen him eat a cockroach.

01:01:40.848 --> 01:01:41.932
It's better from you.

01:01:45.603 --> 01:01:47.313
Come on, buddy.

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:51.567
You can do it.
Please, Flipper, just try it.

01:01:56.071 --> 01:01:57.323
Come on.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.117
That's it. There.

01:02:10.252 --> 01:02:11.253
Come on.

01:02:53.963 --> 01:02:56.674
Listen, sorry about that time
I yelled at you.

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:11.438
I saved you
a couple of slices, extra anchovies.

01:03:43.512 --> 01:03:45.598
This is quite a spread for you.

01:03:46.015 --> 01:03:50.978
I was going to do croissants, but
you might've had a heart attack.

01:03:51.937 --> 01:03:57.067
It's the thought that counts.
Like bringing someone flowers.

01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:59.820
You'll do it one day.

01:04:00.279 --> 01:04:03.532
I bought you flowers!
- You're such a liar!

01:04:05.034 --> 01:04:07.828
What d'ya call that?
- Weeding.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.084
Here are the test results.

01:04:26.013 --> 01:04:30.017
I can't believe it.
He's just like a little kid.

01:04:30.434 --> 01:04:32.895
All he wants to do is play.

01:04:34.021 --> 01:04:35.189
Come here!

01:04:37.024 --> 01:04:38.025
Go on!

01:04:40.569 --> 01:04:42.613
Good boy, that's it.

01:04:44.365 --> 01:04:47.201
Our friend was poisoned!

01:04:49.245 --> 01:04:54.542
Oioxin levels are off the chart.
Another meal and he'd be glowing.

01:04:54.959 --> 01:05:00.005
Someone poisoned him? - Or the water,
which is why the fishing's so bad.

01:05:01.757 --> 01:05:05.094
Ooesn't make sense.
Nearest industry's on the mainland.

01:05:05.803 --> 01:05:09.473
Maybe the mainland's found
a place to dump toxic garbage.

01:05:10.724 --> 01:05:12.601
Uh-oh...
- What now?

01:05:13.018 --> 01:05:16.313
The other night Kim and I
were looking for Flipper.

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:21.694
Oirk Moran's boat was out there.
They were tossing barrels over the side.

01:05:23.279 --> 01:05:26.365
Oo you remember where you were?

01:05:26.782 --> 01:05:30.828
Oefinitely. - Can you show us?
- No problem.

01:05:31.245 --> 01:05:35.165
This is it. Right here.
- No, it was over here.

01:05:35.624 --> 01:05:40.171
No, I'm positive. This is it.
- I'm telling you, I remember.

01:05:40.588 --> 01:05:42.882
Actually, it was more this way.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:48.220
No, over here. - I'm telling you...
- I know it was here somewhere.

01:05:49.638 --> 01:05:53.142
"Somewhere"?
Could you be more specific?

01:05:53.559 --> 01:05:54.977
It was dark.

01:05:55.394 --> 01:06:00.274
Hey, I'm from Chicago.
It's not like there are street signs.

01:06:00.691 --> 01:06:05.905
Oid you notice
the lighthouse on the way out?

01:06:06.906 --> 01:06:09.283
I'm pretty sure this was the spot.
- Me too.

01:06:09.742 --> 01:06:13.495
If you're at all right,
Oirk Moran's been dumping poison

01:06:13.913 --> 01:06:17.750
smack in the middle of my fishing
grounds. Let's head back.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:27.760
We know why
the fishing's been so lousy lately.

01:06:28.219 --> 01:06:32.556
What is it this time?
Algae blooms, el Niño, bad karma?

01:06:32.973 --> 01:06:36.644
Somebody's poisoning
these waters. - We may know who.

01:06:37.102 --> 01:06:39.897
When Flipper came back sick...
- Wait a minute!

01:06:40.314 --> 01:06:42.608
That dolphin's back?

01:06:43.692 --> 01:06:48.405
We're talking about toxic waste.
Costs big bucks to dispose of.

01:06:48.822 --> 01:06:52.576
If you can just dump it in the
ocean... - Look at these test results!

01:06:52.993 --> 01:06:58.207
I'm not interested! Bring me
hard evidence and I'll bust 'em!

01:06:58.666 --> 01:07:03.629
Buck! - Any idea how many
marine parks I've turned away?

01:07:04.046 --> 01:07:06.340
That animal
would be a fine attraction.

01:07:06.799 --> 01:07:09.635
Son-of-a...
- Easy, Oirk.

01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:17.351
If Flipper's still here on Monday,
I will see to it that he's

01:07:17.768 --> 01:07:19.770
jumping hoops at Sea World on Tuesday.

01:07:21.772 --> 01:07:26.068
Still talking about that dolphin?
- No. Actually,

01:07:26.485 --> 01:07:30.239
we were talking about
the slime-ball who's been

01:07:30.656 --> 01:07:33.117
dumping toxic waste offshore.

01:07:34.243 --> 01:07:36.871
That explains
why fishing's been so lousy lately.

01:07:38.455 --> 01:07:40.916
You have an active imagination.

01:07:41.375 --> 01:07:44.336
Just yesterday,
a fella landed a marlin there,

01:07:44.753 --> 01:07:46.422
trophy size.

01:07:46.839 --> 01:07:49.717
These things happen.
Nature has its

01:07:50.134 --> 01:07:53.429
rhythms.
The fishing'll be back.

01:07:53.846 --> 01:07:56.140
And you'll be the boy who cried wolf.

01:08:01.103 --> 01:08:03.022
Remember that dolphin.

01:08:09.945 --> 01:08:13.365
What did he say?
- He needs more evidence.

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:16.035
Like the dead fish ain't enough!

01:08:21.624 --> 01:08:26.587
And Flipper has to be gone by Monday.
- That gives us three days.

01:08:27.004 --> 01:08:30.674
For what? - To deploy our
secret weapon: Flipper.

01:08:31.091 --> 01:08:34.136
What are you talking about?
- Project Quick Find.

01:08:34.553 --> 01:08:37.348
The Navy started it after Korea.

01:08:37.765 --> 01:08:43.270
They trained dolphins to find things
like missiles. It was top secret.

01:08:43.687 --> 01:08:46.941
How do you know about it?
- Part-time work.

01:08:47.358 --> 01:08:50.778
You didn't tell me. - You never told
me about whatshername at the marina.

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:54.698
That was years ago.
How d'ya know about that?

01:08:55.991 --> 01:08:58.202
Cast off. We got work to do.

01:08:58.661 --> 01:09:01.747
Sandy, come up on the bow.
- Hey, Sandy.

01:09:02.163 --> 01:09:04.291
We could miss that concert.
- What concert?

01:09:07.795 --> 01:09:12.049
Microphone?
Nitrox, pressure gauge?

01:09:12.466 --> 01:09:15.094
GPS...
- Nitric oxide,

01:09:15.511 --> 01:09:18.138
ATP, dramomine...

01:09:21.015 --> 01:09:23.560
Seasickness.
- I don't need this. - Sandy,

01:09:23.978 --> 01:09:26.104
never hurl in front of a woman.

01:09:27.606 --> 01:09:30.776
Thanks.
- Something to live by.

01:09:35.363 --> 01:09:36.365
Nice outfit!

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:41.745
Figures.

01:09:46.959 --> 01:09:48.836
Wait for me!

01:10:37.843 --> 01:10:41.430
Porter, can you help Marvin
set up the computer?

01:10:41.847 --> 01:10:46.185
Computer? No problem.
What are you gonna do?

01:10:47.061 --> 01:10:49.063
I'm command central.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.859
I'm keeping track of Flipper.
Tell me when the grunt work's done.

01:10:54.527 --> 01:10:57.947
Grunt work?
We both know I'm good at that...

01:11:00.241 --> 01:11:04.578
Sandy, make sure Flipper's ready.
Kim, you spot. Marv, this is for you.

01:11:05.913 --> 01:11:10.960
Flipper's secret is
echo-location. - Echo what?

01:11:11.377 --> 01:11:17.466
Oolphin sonar. Flipper sends a beam
of sound and receives an echo back.

01:11:17.883 --> 01:11:20.177
He's good at that.
- Like a dog.

01:11:20.594 --> 01:11:24.890
Instead of using his nose,
he uses his... echo... thing.

01:11:27.142 --> 01:11:30.813
Exactly.
The Navy took it one step further.

01:11:37.236 --> 01:11:41.907
Come in, Central Command. We're in
spashdown area, awaiting orders.

01:11:42.324 --> 01:11:46.912
Copy that. Send Flipper
when the ball is secure. Over.

01:11:47.329 --> 01:11:49.790
Go on, boy. Find it!

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.274
Negative on station 1.

01:12:17.151 --> 01:12:20.029
Proceed to next station.

01:12:20.446 --> 01:12:25.326
I love all this Navy talk.
You still have your old uniform?

01:12:37.755 --> 01:12:40.049
Guppy says negative on station four.

01:12:41.926 --> 01:12:43.177
Oamn.

01:12:43.636 --> 01:12:46.722
Negative on station 15.

01:13:26.387 --> 01:13:29.473
We must have
searched the whole ocean by now.

01:13:34.061 --> 01:13:35.855
We should come back tomorrow.

01:13:37.857 --> 01:13:40.818
This Martha Stewart's a clever woman.

01:13:41.235 --> 01:13:45.948
She's made curtains out of fishing
nets. That'd work at my place.

01:13:51.328 --> 01:13:54.331
I think
you really need to get a life.

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:11.640
It's just sea swells.

01:14:32.661 --> 01:14:35.497
I think he found something.

01:14:38.375 --> 01:14:39.376
Hey, look!

01:14:47.426 --> 01:14:50.763
What's happening?
- He found something. What now?

01:14:51.388 --> 01:14:55.226
It's time for
the "Flippo-Cam". - The "Flippo-Cam"?

01:15:00.648 --> 01:15:02.942
You made this?

01:15:04.193 --> 01:15:06.403
You're starting to scare me.

01:15:36.892 --> 01:15:38.352
Giant squid astern!

01:15:39.728 --> 01:15:40.729
Marv, I...

01:15:47.236 --> 01:15:48.696
I don't see anything.

01:16:09.466 --> 01:16:11.468
I bet that's his family.

01:16:48.088 --> 01:16:49.089
POISON

01:16:49.548 --> 01:16:52.676
Oh my God!
- Gross.

01:16:53.093 --> 01:16:55.471
HAZAROOUS WASTE

01:17:04.563 --> 01:17:09.318
We better get hold of old Buck!
- Buck? Try the coastguard.

01:17:09.735 --> 01:17:12.029
Coastguard, this is the Reliable, over.

01:17:14.615 --> 01:17:16.992
Coastguard, this is the Reliable, over.

01:17:22.248 --> 01:17:23.249
Gotcha!

01:17:25.376 --> 01:17:29.755
Coastguard, this is the Reliable, over.
It's not working.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.639
What happened?

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:42.351
Marvin, what's wrong?

01:17:59.451 --> 01:18:03.038
That'll send a signal
so we can find the spot again.

01:18:05.165 --> 01:18:08.502
I'm not going without Flipper.
- This isn't the time.

01:19:58.654 --> 01:20:01.198
This is Porter Ricks.
Anyone out there?

01:20:02.491 --> 01:20:03.826
Hey, Marv.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.954
Where's Sandy?

01:20:10.207 --> 01:20:11.208
Oh my gosh.

01:20:11.667 --> 01:20:12.668
Mr. Ricks!

01:20:13.878 --> 01:20:16.589
Alright, Buck...
- Sandy's gone. - Not now...

01:20:17.006 --> 01:20:18.340
Buck, I...

01:20:20.342 --> 01:20:21.260
Oh God.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.235
Scar!

01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:58.214
No!

01:21:09.934 --> 01:21:11.685
Help!

01:21:42.925 --> 01:21:45.302
Come on, swim!

01:22:19.003 --> 01:22:22.506
That a boy, come on. You're safe.

01:22:25.050 --> 01:22:27.845
That's one courageous little dolphin.

01:22:30.097 --> 01:22:32.183
Too bad you saw us that night, son.

01:22:47.615 --> 01:22:49.700
Thanks buddy!

01:22:50.117 --> 01:22:52.494
That's a good boy!

01:23:06.175 --> 01:23:08.385
You alright?
- I'm fine.

01:23:08.844 --> 01:23:11.514
Thank God.
Your mother would have killed me.

01:23:13.057 --> 01:23:17.853
You remember that story about Scar?
- Yeah. - It's true.

01:23:23.526 --> 01:23:24.985
Thanks.

01:23:27.154 --> 01:23:28.155
You're welcome.

01:23:33.369 --> 01:23:38.165
Get that piece of sea slime
out of here. - Let's go.

01:23:38.582 --> 01:23:41.752
I don't think we got it in time.
EPA's on the way.

01:23:42.545 --> 01:23:46.298
Oon't worry. We'll clean these
waters up, thanks to Flipper.

01:23:47.883 --> 01:23:50.553
What about Flipper?
He saved my life.

01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:52.930
How about it, Buck?

01:23:57.643 --> 01:24:00.813
As long as he's free,
he can make this his home.

01:24:04.525 --> 01:24:06.902
We'll have him looking out for us.

01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:09.947
How about it, Sandy?

01:24:22.084 --> 01:24:27.214
He should go. - What?
- He belongs with his family.

01:24:41.937 --> 01:24:43.480
What is it?

01:24:49.069 --> 01:24:51.822
No, I can't come.

01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:57.328
Go on, it's okay.

01:25:06.795 --> 01:25:07.796
Please!

01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:11.467
Just go!

01:26:51.984 --> 01:26:53.360
Hi Mom!

01:26:55.487 --> 01:26:56.947
Hey bud!

01:26:58.115 --> 01:27:00.659
How was your summer?
- It was a total blast.

01:27:01.118 --> 01:27:02.912
A total blast, huh?

01:27:05.331 --> 01:27:07.541
I can't wait to hear about it.

01:27:17.259 --> 01:27:18.344
See ya around, Marv.

01:27:20.346 --> 01:27:23.015
What's the matter?

01:27:26.143 --> 01:27:28.437
He'll be back. You'll see.

01:27:33.609 --> 01:27:35.819
Gonna miss you.

01:27:36.237 --> 01:27:37.947
I'll miss you too.

01:27:43.661 --> 01:27:46.705
Gimme a sec?
- Come on, let's go on the boat.

01:27:50.835 --> 01:27:53.212
Gonna miss me?

01:28:03.264 --> 01:28:05.307
Bye.
- Bye.

01:28:11.689 --> 01:28:14.149
Take it easy, kid.
- All aboard!

01:28:21.532 --> 01:28:23.659
Bye.
- Take care.

01:28:39.842 --> 01:28:40.843
Wait!

01:28:43.721 --> 01:28:47.850
I forgot one thing.
Can I come back next summer?

01:28:49.685 --> 01:28:52.980
I think you'd better. I just made
a deal for 150 pound of spam.

01:28:58.569 --> 01:28:59.945
Go on, get!

01:29:24.970 --> 01:29:26.055
There!

01:29:27.681 --> 01:29:29.308
Hey, check it out!

01:29:32.895 --> 01:29:34.605
Hey, come on, guys!
