WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:07.465
Okay, I'm leaving.

00:07.549 --> 00:08.925
Could we push dinner an hour?

00:09.009 --> 00:11.344
-Commission work?
-Mmm.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.971
No, files.

00:13.054 --> 00:15.598
We issued a duces tecum
to Inspector McCarthy.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.767
He must have brought
his life story with him.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.270
(sighs) Frank, you've gotta
let yourself up a little.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.896
We're in too far to have nothing.

00:23.106 --> 00:25.817
I'll be thinking unceasingly of you

00:25.900 --> 00:27.610
as I hold the lamb chops.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.820
What time?

00:30.697 --> 00:31.698
7:30.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.743
You lie. 8:00?

00:34.826 --> 00:35.952
8:00.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.580
Item six: khaki officers.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.957
Now, I had to let
another one go yesterday.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.792
-(all murmuring)
-I know! I know!

00:42.876 --> 00:47.422
I know, she was a knockout.
Yeah, but she couldn't file.

00:47.505 --> 00:48.923
She couldn't intake.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.134
-You sure about that, Sarge?
-(all laughing)

00:51.217 --> 00:54.888
Well, this is the fourth khaki
officer in ten days,

00:54.971 --> 00:56.556
ever since Schnitz and Deroy eloped.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.933
I don't know
whether I'm getting fussy in my old age

00:59.017 --> 01:01.394
or whether personnel's going bing-bong.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.396
Anyway, today is a fresh start
with a new face.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.608
Let's help her along,
hope everything works out for the best.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.110
Item seven: assignments.

01:09.194 --> 01:13.364
Detective Belker is undercover
at 145th Street bus terminal.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.532
He's handling baggage.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.951
He's checking drug transactions,

01:17.035 --> 01:19.287
which I now understand are about as covert

01:19.370 --> 01:21.956
as the Istanbul grand bazaar.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.834
Also, Detectives Washington and Larue

01:24.918 --> 01:28.088
continue their investigation
on the death of detective Garibaldi.

01:28.171 --> 01:31.633
Maybe day ten is gonna
be lucky, fellas, huh?

01:32.258 --> 01:36.596
Now, the last item:
the last item is delicate.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.806
It's very personal.

01:39.265 --> 01:41.184
Now, I happen to find
on the squad room floor

01:41.267 --> 01:43.937
yesterday PM, a list.

01:44.020 --> 01:47.982
It's a collection of
12 women's names and initials.

01:48.066 --> 01:52.529
People, venereal disease
is nothing to sneeze at.

01:52.612 --> 01:55.406
-(laughter)
-If this is females

01:55.490 --> 01:57.617
with which that person
has had contact with,

01:57.700 --> 02:01.830
I can only encourage
the party who lost this list

02:01.913 --> 02:05.291
to come forward and reclaim
same, no questions asked.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.711
Hey, Sarge, is the name
"D. D." on that list?

02:08.795 --> 02:09.963
-(laughter)
-No, listen.

02:10.046 --> 02:13.091
It's not funny! It's not funny!

02:13.174 --> 02:16.302
If it was you, J.D., or anybody else,

02:16.386 --> 02:19.139
it is your duty to notify
the other persons on the list

02:19.222 --> 02:21.015
so they can get their penicillin shots.

02:21.099 --> 02:25.270
Now, I'm gonna post the list upstairs
in an envelope on the watch board.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.938
I want the proper party to pick it up,

02:27.021 --> 02:29.065
and I don't want anybody
schoolboying around.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.608
(laughter)

02:30.692 --> 02:34.028
Okay, that's it. Let's have a safe shift.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.197
Let's go do our jobs and do them good.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.409
(indistinct conversations)

02:42.370 --> 02:44.164
Uh... Joseph?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.422
I got an itch, Sarge.
You ever have an itch before?

02:54.716 --> 02:55.925
Not there, Joe.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.105
(indistinct bus announcements)

03:09.189 --> 03:10.690
I think that's my bag.

03:10.773 --> 03:13.026
-May I see your ticket?
-The brown one.

03:13.109 --> 03:14.736
-Yeah.
-MAN: How long...

03:14.819 --> 03:19.782
-(announcements continue)
-WOMAN: I don't think I want any bag.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.202
MAN: <i>Lady, please.</i>

03:23.161 --> 03:25.622
There's a guy coming through
with a chicken jacket,

03:25.705 --> 03:26.706
a maroon knit cap,

03:26.789 --> 03:29.500
<i>about 5'11", might be a player.</i>

03:29.584 --> 03:30.501
Copy.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.045
You watch him.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.888
Mine, uh, big duffel.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.056
Got a bus ticket?

03:43.806 --> 03:45.558
I lost it. It's that one there.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.239
Stay with chicken jacket.
I think we got something here.

04:02.533 --> 04:06.412
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Last call for passengers boarding for...</i>

04:12.168 --> 04:15.213
(indistinct chatter)

04:27.350 --> 04:30.311
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Passengers boarding for Lake Forest...</i>

04:56.587 --> 04:58.423
Mind your own business, Jack.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.967
(man speaking indistinctly)

05:01.968 --> 05:04.178
-Hey, wait up!
-Springfield bus.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.097
My mama's. She's already on.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.473
Gimme a hand with this, huh?

05:08.224 --> 05:12.186
ANNOUNCER: <i>Last call for bus 18</i>
<i>departing for Springfield.</i>

05:12.270 --> 05:16.357
<i>Passengers for Springfield,</i>
<i>last call for bus 18.</i>

05:16.441 --> 05:20.069
(Belker groans)

05:21.988 --> 05:24.365
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:24.449 --> 05:26.659
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

05:26.743 --> 05:30.496
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:37.628 --> 05:41.049
(theme music playing)

06:44.278 --> 06:47.156
(indistinct chatter)

06:47.240 --> 06:48.741
Stan.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.494
-Commission, about an hour and a half.
-Right, Captain.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.998
-Good morning. Morning, Sergeant.
-Mrs. Furillo.

06:56.082 --> 06:58.000
-Magenta 11 requests.
-Ah.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.879
Also, Mr. Garibaldi understood
that there may be some things

07:01.963 --> 07:04.715
left in Harry's locker to be picked up.
He's leaving town tonight.

07:04.799 --> 07:06.634
I think they're still in evidence impound.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.970
Can't we have the impound lifted?
It's been ten days.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.347
-I'll see what I can do.
-Good. Thank you.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.684
Well, I'm off to deliver
my magenta 11 to four other precincts.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.019
I can't help thinking
this worked out better before.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.438
(scoffs) You're right. It did.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.655
My cousin.

07:27.738 --> 07:31.033
-Is that so?
-The list isn't what you think, Stan.

07:31.117 --> 07:34.078
I mean, it's a list, but it's not--

07:35.329 --> 07:36.622
I don't have any infections.

07:37.498 --> 07:38.499
Or your cousin.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.001
Yeah, neither of us.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.212
It was just people I've known.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.006
So there's no public-health component.

07:45.089 --> 07:47.467
-No public-health component.
-Well, that's all.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.843
Sergeant Jablowski?

07:48.926 --> 07:51.053
-Jablonski.
-Maureen Dolan.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.015
Mr. Pierson in personnel
told me to report to you.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.434
Oh, well, why don't you step
over here, Maureen?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.146
Do you have any experience
in this kind of work?

08:00.229 --> 08:02.023
Well, I did the weekend course, of course.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.274
Of course.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.776
And I've done uniform counter work,

08:05.860 --> 08:08.821
and my last job was in
the car-rental industry.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.239
-Oh.
-Sergeant Jablonski?

08:10.323 --> 08:11.491
Yeah, just a sec.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.034
I'm transfer Rodriguez.

08:13.117 --> 08:16.120
Yeah. Just a second, transfer Rodriguez.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.456
Car rental. Is that so?

08:20.124 --> 08:21.918
-Lieutenant Buntz!
-Yeah.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.754
Can you direct me toward
detectives Larue and Washington?

08:24.837 --> 08:26.714
-They're out.
-Oh. Listen.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.926
I got something real urgent.
Maybe me and you could talk?

08:30.009 --> 08:31.511
Yeah, come on.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.889
There's this individual,
Lou Russ, very bad,

08:34.972 --> 08:38.476
like something you'd see in a cage
playing with a rubber tire.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.686
He approaches me
this morning on the street

08:40.770 --> 08:43.022
about unloading some army weapons.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.815
Picked you right out of the blue, right?

08:44.899 --> 08:48.110
Hey, we're talking about some
serious hardware, Lieutenant.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.238
Automatic weapons, machine guns,

08:50.321 --> 08:51.822
stuff you don't want on the street.

08:51.906 --> 08:52.865
I got some interest?

08:53.616 --> 08:55.785
So far, you're accessory
to a federal crime.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.620
My thinking exactly.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.705
I mean,
I'm alone with this guy in a basement.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.041
He's showing me all kinds of firepower.

09:02.124 --> 09:06.128
I'm thinking to myself,
"Sid, what kind of move is this

09:06.212 --> 09:08.422
for a person in a parole situation?

09:08.506 --> 09:11.050
I mean, I'm gonna be middleman
for gun deals

09:11.133 --> 09:12.843
sweating out $40 bucks on either end?

09:12.927 --> 09:14.470
Come on back on course, Sidney."

09:14.554 --> 09:17.640
This isn't gonna be, like,
an uplifting story, is it?

09:17.723 --> 09:20.017
Uh-uh, he's kneeling down in front of me

09:20.101 --> 09:22.019
clawing open a carton of grenades.

09:22.103 --> 09:26.607
I'm standing behind him.
Bing. I come to my senses.

09:26.691 --> 09:27.900
With a crowbar.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.028
Bash! On the back of the head.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.948
I was scared he wasn't gonna go down.

09:34.031 --> 09:35.074
What a relief.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.325
Are you a psychopath?

09:36.409 --> 09:39.954
No! I went through a phase like that,
but this was for real.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.122
The guy's still there.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.165
I handcuffed him to a steam pipe.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.127
Where's this steam pipe located?

09:48.170 --> 09:49.589
The warehouse district.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.177
This guy better be there.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.431
Hey, I promise you,
unless he chewed off his hand.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.474
-Let's go find out.
-Thank you. Hey.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.060
Can I call you "Norm"?

10:03.978 --> 10:06.939
Guys, nobody Andy Sedita did business with

10:07.023 --> 10:09.442
is gonna buy paper on a cop,
not in this climate.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.152
Maybe they didn't know he was a cop.

10:11.235 --> 10:13.487
Sedita told me he was asking on a cop.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.032
He's not gonna tell Margley?
He's not gonna tell Russy?

10:16.115 --> 10:17.450
We got our standards, too.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.910
I like to know the applicant's occupation.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.997
-You bored with us, Santangelo?
-All right, you got a job to do.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.249
There's some things you learn
in this business, fellas.

10:25.333 --> 10:28.127
You could take an oath,
you jump up and down, you break furniture.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.755
Some paper doesn't make it.
Some notes you gotta write off.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.882
We're not writing off Garibaldi.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.426
Well, I hope something turns up.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.637
Come on.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.891
(train whistle blowing)

10:58.574 --> 11:00.117
You ever done this before?

11:00.201 --> 11:01.619
I know the procedure.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.037
That's not what I asked you.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.039
No.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.167
(sighs)

11:08.250 --> 11:09.460
All right, come on.

11:12.421 --> 11:15.132
I want you to stay behind
my peripheral vision.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.301
That's right about here.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.887
Everything back of that is your problem.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.122
(grunting and clanking)

11:59.552 --> 12:01.178
(laughs)

12:01.262 --> 12:02.930
Looky here, Rodriguez, huh?

12:03.639 --> 12:06.225
Now, this is what you call
tough but not too bright.

12:06.976 --> 12:11.272
(laughs) Now, uh, we're gonna unlock you,

12:11.355 --> 12:14.150
and we're gonna cuff you behind your back,
you got it, tough guy?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.485
I want you to hold your breath.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.780
If you breathe, you get
another nipple... all right?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.199
Yeah.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.453
Ready? And...

12:25.536 --> 12:26.746
(inhales)

12:26.829 --> 12:28.372
Hold it.

12:35.963 --> 12:39.508
(handcuffs locking)

12:41.886 --> 12:43.012
He's cuffed, Lieutenant.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.015
Okay, big breath now.

12:46.682 --> 12:48.017
(exhales deeply)

12:48.809 --> 12:50.352
(laughs) Oh, you like that, huh?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.521
I had scampi last night.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.775
Come on. Let's get out of here.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.528
Transportation Officer Nizer, Sergeant.

13:00.696 --> 13:02.698
Nizer? This is Sergeant Jablonski.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.658
Belker hasn't called in yet.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.911
Well, if he told you
to tail him, tail him.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.206
Maybe his handy talkie's on the fritz.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.249
Maybe he doesn't have anything to report.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.586
Yeah, I notified all units. Right.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.216
Some communications foul-up with Belker.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.510
Maybe he's shopping.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.596
(man and woman speaking indistinctly
in the background)

13:26.680 --> 13:30.768
ANNOUNCER:<i> Last call for bus 18</i>
<i>departing for Springfield.</i>

13:30.851 --> 13:34.897
<i>Passengers for Springfield,</i>
<i>this is last call for bus 18.</i>

13:42.947 --> 13:45.241
Okay, that's it! Springfield's there!

13:50.704 --> 13:52.748
(Belker groans)

14:04.552 --> 14:07.054
Mr. Pak, Trenton, what's good?

14:07.137 --> 14:08.180
Good apples today.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.850
Listen to a man who knows fruit, man.
Take the cherries, okay?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.518
Everything okay, Mr. Pak?

14:12.601 --> 14:13.894
He try very hard.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.522
You allowing him to make change yet?

14:16.605 --> 14:18.274
Not yet. Soon.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.027
-Trenton, let's go with the cherries, man!
-All right, found the cherries.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.946
Kept my thumb off the scale
being he's a cop.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.365
What are you saying? Never thumb on scale.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.367
Look, it was a joke, man.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.785
You know joke, Mr. Pak?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.579
Want some?

14:31.662 --> 14:32.746
$1.50.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.624
Mmm! Mmm!

14:35.708 --> 14:37.042
Those are the best.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.129
I'm worried, man.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.381
Jody Buffum and them been coming
around here,

14:42.464 --> 14:44.800
wants me to tighten him up
or he's gonna trash the place,

14:44.884 --> 14:47.011
says the neighborhood
don't need no zipperheads.

14:47.094 --> 14:50.764
Jody's a punk, Trenton.
You got a job to do here, man.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.100
$3.50 change, count.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.437
-Five new dollar.
-Five new dollar.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.938
He got me talking like him now.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.984
-(laughs)
-3...4...5.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.193
Thanks, Mr. Pak.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.320
Thank you, sir.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.323
Keep me up on what's going down.

15:07.406 --> 15:08.824
Look, I gotta handle this myself.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.368
If you can't, you call me. Simple.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.208
We should prepare
for an initial arraignment

15:18.292 --> 15:20.794
on possession of stolen
property, Mr. Russ.

15:22.129 --> 15:24.673
However, considering the weapons
were of military origin,

15:24.757 --> 15:27.176
there may be a second
arraignment on federal charges.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.179
Yeah, we won't bother with all that.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.639
I'm afraid I don't follow.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.266
I got something to give, lady.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.311
These are serious charges.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.564
You'd have to be offering
something substantial

15:40.648 --> 15:43.108
or there's no point
in even approaching the district attorney.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.319
What if I just marched into

15:45.402 --> 15:47.279
that big commission they got going

15:48.697 --> 15:52.076
and I give them the dude
who offed Chief Keenan?

15:53.577 --> 15:55.245
You think that would interest them?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.206
Yes, they'd be interested.

16:00.459 --> 16:04.755
Of course, then I'd have to get me
some immunity.

16:05.547 --> 16:06.423
Am I right?

16:06.507 --> 16:09.301
The other side's interested
in trading up, Mr. Russ.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.470
As long as they feel
that what you're giving them

16:11.553 --> 16:13.973
is worth more than what
they're charging you with,

16:14.056 --> 16:15.140
they may deal.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.892
No immunity...

16:18.143 --> 16:19.687
no Keenan.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.647
I'll talk to them.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.238
I'll start on these numbers, Frank.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.908
Captain, I've got a client
you'll want to speak to.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.536
-About?
-Commission matters. Joe Keenan's killer.

16:35.619 --> 16:36.829
-Interrogation?
-Lineup.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.206
He wants immunity, Frank.
Know that going in.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.709
Henry, something
on the Keenan investigation.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.502
Get Irwin for me, would you please?

16:44.753 --> 16:48.298
When Keenan was killed,
you found the murder weapon,

16:48.382 --> 16:51.010
a chrome-finish .357 magnum,

16:51.093 --> 16:53.470
-Smith and Wesson.
-That's the way it was described

16:53.554 --> 16:55.889
-in the newspapers.
-Papers give the serial number?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.100
No.

16:58.726 --> 17:02.104
Well, you get your files out,
'cause I'm gonna give them to you.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.982
That weapon wasn't registered.
How is it you have the serial number?

17:05.065 --> 17:06.150
I sold that gun.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.738
I keep the serial numbers right here.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.823
The series is 6N.

17:13.532 --> 17:17.745
The number is 43751.

17:19.246 --> 17:20.164
That's correct.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.667
The first snort was free.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.171
That's as far as I go without immunity,

17:27.921 --> 17:29.048
but you better believe

17:29.923 --> 17:32.051
I can tell you who I sold that gun to.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.427
Terms, gentlemen?

17:36.972 --> 17:39.099
For testimony to the
commission naming names

17:39.183 --> 17:40.934
and at any subsequent trial,

17:41.685 --> 17:43.937
we can grant immunity from
prosecution on all charges

17:44.021 --> 17:45.606
pertaining to the military weapons.

17:45.689 --> 17:49.902
-I can live with that.
-That's big of you, but I can't.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.322
Look, I'm not gonna be talking weapons.

17:54.448 --> 17:55.908
I'm gonna be talking about Keenan.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.701
You could get up there
and say you killed Keenan,

17:57.785 --> 18:00.037
and there's no way we're
granting immunity on that.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.247
I didn't kill Keenan.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.627
(whispers)
That's what I needed to hear, Frank.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.462
Let's give him immunity on anything else.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.882
Suppose we proceed with the understanding

18:11.965 --> 18:14.593
that if you pulled the trigger on Keenan,
there is no immunity.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.387
As for the other crimes,
we can give you testimonial immunity

18:17.471 --> 18:19.181
when responding to our direct inquiry.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.016
What's that?

18:22.392 --> 18:24.895
Testimonial immunity means
that any statement you give us

18:24.978 --> 18:26.522
or anywhere that statement leads us

18:26.605 --> 18:29.441
cannot be used against you,
but the police could still prove

18:29.525 --> 18:31.318
the crime against you independently.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.904
So then, that's not total
and complete immunity.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.031
It's as total and complete
as we've ever gone.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.118
May we go total and complete immunity

18:39.201 --> 18:41.161
on all matters commission related?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.039
Mm-hmm.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.042
Hey... I'm worth it.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.547
Let's go.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.132
Let's get Mr. Russ signed,

18:53.215 --> 18:55.634
see if we can get him
downtown for our 1:00.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.721
ANNOUNCER: <i>Bus 54 has just arrived from...</i>

19:05.269 --> 19:08.522
<i>If you are meeting passengers</i>
<i>incoming from these cities,</i>

19:08.605 --> 19:12.025
<i>they are disembarking at gate</i>
<i>3B immediately.</i>

19:12.693 --> 19:15.279
Somebody! Let me out!

19:16.113 --> 19:18.031
There's a person in there!

19:18.115 --> 19:21.535
S-Somebody... uh, call the porter.

19:23.954 --> 19:24.913
Someone inside?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.331
Yes!

19:26.415 --> 19:27.416
Who are you?

19:27.499 --> 19:30.085
What possible difference does that make?

19:30.169 --> 19:34.256
Will you please open the duffel bag?

19:34.339 --> 19:35.799
Why don't you help him?

19:35.883 --> 19:37.926
Okay, uh, I'm gonna let you out.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.679
(shouting) When?

19:41.722 --> 19:42.890
Watch your head.

19:59.781 --> 20:00.908
Where is this?

20:00.991 --> 20:02.451
Springfield.

20:02.534 --> 20:04.077
What were you doing in there?

20:04.161 --> 20:07.122
(growls)

20:08.081 --> 20:10.792
I will tell you now
a story of persecution,

20:10.876 --> 20:13.629
a story of a great family
driven into hiding

20:13.712 --> 20:16.131
under the tyranny of godless communism.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.425
Many in the family were discovered.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.553
Accused falsely as symbols of
decadence, they were destroyed.

20:21.637 --> 20:25.974
Their young were sometimes eaten
as delicacies at state banquets.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.560
But those of great spirit prevailed.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.521
With us today, survivor of the great clan,

20:31.605 --> 20:34.191
smuggled into Hong Kong
less than a decade ago,

20:34.274 --> 20:37.194
my friends, Empress Ping Mae.

20:37.277 --> 20:40.447
(applause)

20:44.076 --> 20:46.203
Franchise owners are moving among you now

20:46.286 --> 20:47.788
with the empress's offspring.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.122
As we continue,

20:49.206 --> 20:52.876
touch and savor the tactile
pleasure of Shar-Pei,

20:52.960 --> 20:56.171
the natural velour of the single coat,

20:56.255 --> 20:57.589
unique to this rare breed.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.633
This dog, raised to virile perfection,

20:59.716 --> 21:02.719
could bring each of you
an income of... Mr. Shannon?

21:03.512 --> 21:06.431
What was your income last month
from stud and franchise fees?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.433
$4,200, sir.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.353
(applause)

21:11.436 --> 21:15.899
And as you expand your territory,
you increase your profits incrementally.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.485
Excuse me, Mr. Burhan,

21:18.568 --> 21:21.738
so you're saying that
the investor owns a share

21:21.822 --> 21:23.490
in all of his stud's offspring?

21:23.573 --> 21:26.576
Exactly so, in your franchise zone.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.161
Ah. (chuckles)

21:28.245 --> 21:30.622
Well, I'm favorably impressed.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.583
However much love, comfort the home,

21:33.667 --> 21:38.839
Shar-Pei adds more love,
more comfort, more companionship

21:38.922 --> 21:41.508
in occasional moments of loneliness.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.802
(chuckles) Sweet.

21:43.885 --> 21:46.763
Pick him up, sir. Don't be shy.

21:53.895 --> 21:57.024
(chuckles)

21:57.107 --> 21:58.108
Whoa!

21:58.191 --> 21:59.693
I'm all right. I'm all right.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.695
You little brigand, you. (laughs)

22:02.404 --> 22:05.115
Will you examine this weapon, Mr. Russ?

22:05.198 --> 22:08.243
Let the record show Mr. Russ
is examining exhibit 53.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.288
Do you recognize the weapon?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.460
Yes, I know this gun.

22:16.543 --> 22:17.753
When did you last see it?

22:19.046 --> 22:20.797
The day that Joe Keenan was shot,

22:21.423 --> 22:25.093
I sold that gun to an individual
named Charlie Weeks.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.932
Would you be referring
to a former police officer,

22:31.016 --> 22:34.144
Charles Weeks,
formerly with the special narcotics?

22:34.227 --> 22:37.481
Yeah, he used to be a cop.
Then he got himself into a lot of trouble.

22:37.564 --> 22:41.360
How was it that Charles Weeks came to you
for the purchase of that weapon?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.904
He knew me. He knew I had guns.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.199
We were in Harrisonville together.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.909
Cops go to jail, too.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.496
May we get this straight
for the records, please?

22:52.579 --> 22:54.289
On May 19th of last year,

22:54.373 --> 22:58.335
Charles Weeks purchased
the weapon marked exhibit 53

22:58.418 --> 23:00.087
from you, is that correct?

23:00.170 --> 23:02.172
Yeah, he gave me $400 for it.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.257
I gave him his shells for nothing.

23:05.092 --> 23:06.843
Did he tell you why he wanted the weapon?

23:08.011 --> 23:10.639
He said he was having
trouble with somebody big

23:10.722 --> 23:12.391
and he needed a clean piece.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.812
Were you aware that
Charles Weeks had worked

23:16.895 --> 23:20.232
for Deputy Chief Joe Keenan
as a so-called dirty-tactics guy

23:20.315 --> 23:22.442
in the "Daniels for Mayor" campaign?

23:22.526 --> 23:25.695
Yeah, well, Charlie,
Charlie had kind of a mouth.

23:26.988 --> 23:30.450
He was always bragging about how
if Daniels got elected,

23:30.534 --> 23:32.202
it was gonna make Charlie a big shot.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.122
When did you last see Charles Weeks?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.502
It was on Tuesday, the 11th of this month,

23:40.585 --> 23:41.628
10:00 in the morning.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.841
Why are you so certain of that date?

23:50.554 --> 23:53.765
That was the day I killed Harry Garibaldi.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.063
You asked him a direct question,
yes or no?

24:00.147 --> 24:02.607
-He didn't answer directly.
-I don't even agree with that.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.152
You asked him how he was certain
about the date he last saw Weeks.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.696
-He happened to kill somebody that day?
-If I ask him the time of day

24:07.779 --> 24:10.699
and he answers, "I killed Garibaldi,"
there's no immunity.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.200
Even on that one, I'm not sure.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.618
Not sure? Irwin?

24:13.702 --> 24:15.787
He couldn't just lug it in
out of nowhere, Joyce.

24:15.871 --> 24:18.039
And you know damn well he didn't, Irwin.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.292
People, I'd advise you to read
the deal you signed.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.751
And I advise you, Counselor,

24:21.835 --> 24:24.713
there is no way I let Russ
walk on Garibaldi's murder.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.089
That's up to you.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.633
Just don't use that testimony
in any shape or form.

24:30.594 --> 24:33.680
You could take it to appellate division,
try and get an in-camera ruling.

24:33.763 --> 24:34.681
Can we win?

24:34.764 --> 24:36.725
Frank, what do you want to do about Weeks?

24:36.808 --> 24:38.602
Bust him. Go, find him.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.481
Let's try and live with
what we got, Frank.

24:42.564 --> 24:43.940
We just got Joe Keenan's killer.

24:44.024 --> 24:46.109
That's what this whole
commission was empanelled for.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.944
I won't give up Garibaldi, Irwin.

24:48.653 --> 24:49.863
I think we gave him up.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.032
Russ doesn't walk. That doesn't happen.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.335
I don't need these arrest warrants.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.462
Mr. Weeks ain't here.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.422
We still want to search the apartment.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.925
Suit yourself.

25:11.468 --> 25:12.928
302's right here.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.764
-All right, thanks. Take off.
-What's your door technique, Norm?

25:15.847 --> 25:19.392
-You a kicker or a croucher?
-I look like a croucher to you?

25:19.476 --> 25:21.770
Them Europeans nearly ruined
the game of football.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.730
I told you, Mr. Weeks ain't here.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.565
I've been taking his mail.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.070
You're right. Go on, take off.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.455
Take it easy!

25:40.539 --> 25:41.831
Why? What do you mean?

25:41.915 --> 25:43.458
They gotta rent this place again!

25:43.542 --> 25:45.752
So? The next guy will redecorate, huh?

25:45.835 --> 25:47.629
(laughs)

25:49.130 --> 25:52.092
Ho! Whoa! Look at all these bedbugs, huh?

25:52.175 --> 25:54.469
Old weeks had a lot of mouths to feed.

25:55.637 --> 25:57.722
Oh, looky here.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.725
Here's the little woman, huh?

26:00.809 --> 26:02.727
(laughs)

26:32.757 --> 26:36.261
(whistling)

26:48.648 --> 26:49.691
I need a hand here.

26:50.817 --> 26:52.068
Yeah, sure thing.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.242
What do we got? Oh, a strongbox, huh?

26:59.326 --> 27:00.994
Maybe this is pay dirt, Lieutenant.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.912
I can't budge it. I'll heat up some water.

27:05.749 --> 27:06.708
Get back.

27:13.715 --> 27:14.924
Ta-da!

27:15.008 --> 27:16.468
(laughs)

27:19.888 --> 27:21.640
Norm... N.G.

27:22.682 --> 27:25.602
You know, you and me,
we got a different approach, Lieutenant.

27:25.685 --> 27:26.811
I try to enjoy the work.

27:26.895 --> 27:30.065
I want you to enjoy the work.
I want you and me to get along.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.941
I don't want to be killed by a ricochet!

27:32.734 --> 27:33.735
Point taken.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.071
Attaboy.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.658
Your questions have to be inductive.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.992
English, Irwin.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.662
You can't convey direct
information about Russ

27:43.745 --> 27:45.664
or his connection with Garibaldi's death.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.666
You can only put questions to them

27:47.749 --> 27:49.376
about their own investigation.

27:49.459 --> 27:50.919
Tip me if I'm going wrong.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.423
Give me your theory
of Garibaldi's killing.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.841
Nothing new on it, Captain.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.094
I'm not asking if there's anything new.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.597
Tell me your theory of the case.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.101
Well, we think it was
gambling related, Captain.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.729
We think Garibaldi owed a bookie,
most likely Andy Sedita.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.856
And whoever he owed sold
the debt to a shylock.

28:11.940 --> 28:15.235
Captain, we been to every
shylock Sedita ever used.

28:15.318 --> 28:18.947
Is there anything
in the circumstances of the case

28:19.030 --> 28:21.199
that argue looking to money sources

28:21.282 --> 28:23.952
Sedita didn't typically use?

28:24.452 --> 28:25.829
You want us to do that?

28:26.913 --> 28:28.331
What do <i>you </i>think you should do?

28:28.415 --> 28:29.582
What's going on?

28:29.666 --> 28:30.917
Answer me, J.D.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.421
Do you think we ought to go
to small-scale usurers now?

28:34.504 --> 28:36.381
We could try extortionists, Captain,

28:37.048 --> 28:39.342
6-for-5 guys at construction sites.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.389
Once you get a printout on the eligibles,

28:44.472 --> 28:48.518
I'd be interested to know
how you think we should proceed.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.520
We'll let you know our thinking, Captain.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.482
-What's the 20 questions?
-You're wasting time, J.D.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.317
Hey, come on, John. Let's go, babe.

28:58.653 --> 28:59.988
Was that legal, Irwin?

29:01.072 --> 29:01.906
Yes or no?

29:01.990 --> 29:04.492
Maybe. At least,
I could make the argument.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.493
Go ahead.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.788
Stan, evidence collected
at Charles Weeks' apartment.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.415
We're gonna itemize and catalog.

29:10.498 --> 29:12.250
-Interrogation "B."
-Hey, listen.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.960
I'll see you in 30 seconds.

29:14.043 --> 29:15.462
Hey, tell me, can I leave?

29:16.129 --> 29:18.590
I suppose you could request
judicial relief

29:18.673 --> 29:20.258
for lack of probable cause.

29:20.341 --> 29:21.676
I may ask you for that.

29:22.385 --> 29:24.512
Why don't you just stay clean, Mr. Russ?

29:24.596 --> 29:25.889
A man's gotta eat.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.517
Ah!

29:29.601 --> 29:31.060
You'd better hide, Judas.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.813
Hey, don't you address me
in a threatening way.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.191
And you don't understand
what happened anyways.

29:36.274 --> 29:37.567
Are we done? Am I out?

29:38.318 --> 29:40.236
Out? What is he talking about "out"?

29:40.320 --> 29:42.614
I'm out of here, Sid. I'm skating.

29:42.697 --> 29:46.117
Hey, this man is under arrest.
Detective Buntz, he's out?

29:46.201 --> 29:48.578
Louis Russ is out? Are you guys crazy?

29:48.661 --> 29:50.497
Yeah, I understand he cut
some kind of deal

29:50.580 --> 29:52.207
with the Furillo commission.

29:53.374 --> 29:54.876
You be good, Sid.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.675
I come down to get my $200.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.677
I might as well use it for a body bag.

30:04.761 --> 30:07.430
Hey, come on.
Let's have your buddies okay your payout.

30:07.514 --> 30:10.308
Come on, Lieutenant, don't squeeze me now!

30:10.391 --> 30:12.060
I'm gonna have to blow town!

30:12.143 --> 30:13.645
What's Furillo's shot, Neal?

30:13.728 --> 30:15.939
Whatever it is, he doesn't
want us to know about it.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.440
Let's not fight the man, love.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.359
You're getting a ton of names.

30:19.442 --> 30:21.361
If we could make the inquiry
more specific...

30:21.444 --> 30:23.404
Hey, if I could make it
more specific, I would.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.949
Tell me your arrangement with this guy.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.242
50 bucks when he's right.

30:27.325 --> 30:28.493
50?

30:29.202 --> 30:30.286
Not 200?

30:30.370 --> 30:33.206
Oh this is great. You guys.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.208
You put a python back on the street.

30:35.291 --> 30:38.002
A little mouse is scrambling
around waiting to be lunch

30:38.086 --> 30:40.588
and you won't give him
his last piece of cheese?

30:40.672 --> 30:41.965
What's he talking about?

30:42.048 --> 30:44.968
He gave me something,
said you guys pay him a deuce.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.053
Louis Russ I gave him,

30:47.136 --> 30:49.764
very good friend to the Loch Ness Monster.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.183
I popped the guy
for moving some hot pieces.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.394
Then he went in front
of the captain's commission.

30:54.477 --> 30:56.896
-He must have cut some kind of deal.
-Tell him the name.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.816
Russ, two S's. Louis.

30:59.899 --> 31:02.318
Punch it up,
see if it fits the profile we gave you.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.573
I think I just heard a penny drop, Neal.

31:06.656 --> 31:10.660
Louis Russ: racketeering,
assault, usurious commerce.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.996
Give Sid his $50.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.209
Thanks for the help.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.796
Oh, my pleasure!

31:21.880 --> 31:25.884
I need total facial surgery
and relocation from the state!

31:25.967 --> 31:27.510
This should just about do it.

31:29.929 --> 31:30.930
J.D.?

31:31.014 --> 31:33.725
Shot in the dark, Captain. Louis Russ.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.476
That the name you want us to come up with?

31:35.560 --> 31:36.811
-Frank...
-Listen to me, J.D.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.064
Have you ever heard of a case in which
the accused has been given bad Miranda?

31:40.148 --> 31:43.234
-It's been known to happen.
-How did you go forward in that situation?

31:43.318 --> 31:44.694
It's gotta make independently.

31:44.777 --> 31:47.238
You can't use the confession
or any of its proceeds--

31:50.325 --> 31:52.619
Are you telling me
that Russ got bad Miranda

31:52.702 --> 31:54.203
-for killing Garibaldi--
-J.D.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.541
Don't say a word.

32:03.504 --> 32:07.216
Uh... (chuckles) I guess so.
In for a penny, in for a pound.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.135
Got something both
of you oughta listen to.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.511
Go ahead. I'll be right there.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.889
Renko, look at all this--

32:12.972 --> 32:16.517
You the guy on notify officer
on incidents at a Korean grocery store?

32:16.601 --> 32:17.810
Yeah, what happened?

32:17.894 --> 32:19.479
Robbery, shots fired, man down.

32:19.562 --> 32:23.358
-You put a notify officer on Pak's store?
-Let's go, Renko.

32:23.441 --> 32:26.361
Is this with Trenton Moore?
Why don't you adopt him?

32:26.444 --> 32:28.446
I hate this gunky ink.

32:34.243 --> 32:37.246
Miss Dolan, you mind if I ask you

32:37.330 --> 32:39.123
a completely candid question?

32:40.792 --> 32:42.335
Don't get naughty, Sarge.

32:43.586 --> 32:44.712
What do you mean?

32:46.005 --> 32:47.048
Nothing.

32:48.675 --> 32:49.884
Go ahead.

32:50.927 --> 32:52.178
How did you get this job?

32:54.138 --> 32:55.765
Well, I told you, from Mr. Pierson.

32:55.848 --> 32:57.475
I know, I know, from personnel,

32:57.558 --> 33:00.144
and I also know
that you're civil service qualified.

33:02.939 --> 33:04.357
-Uh-uh.
-Uh-uh?

33:04.440 --> 33:06.693
What uh-uh? You gotta be qualified.

33:06.776 --> 33:08.111
It's a civil-service job.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.362
Well, then, I must be.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.657
Didn't you take
a civil-service examination?

33:14.617 --> 33:17.412
See, I met Mr. Pierson at the airport,
and I was just so lucky

33:17.495 --> 33:19.205
because I had just lost my rental car job,

33:19.288 --> 33:22.041
and I was just walking around the corner,
and Fred and his cousin,

33:22.125 --> 33:23.960
they were just coming back
from Atlantic City.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.837
Yeah, Fred being Mr. Pierson?

33:25.920 --> 33:28.006
Uh-huh, and I just got so lucky

33:28.089 --> 33:31.009
because he gave me his card,
and he said he thought there was something

33:31.092 --> 33:33.011
-he could do with me.
-I'll bet.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.557
Well, I mean, but...

33:38.391 --> 33:41.269
if there's an exam to take,
I'd be happy to take it.

33:42.687 --> 33:43.855
Excuse me.

33:44.772 --> 33:45.940
I'll watch the counter.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.152
KEENAN: <i>Let's be honest</i>
<i>with each other, Charlie.</i>

33:49.235 --> 33:51.029
<i>-</i>WEEKS: <i>Sure.</i>
<i>-</i>KEENAN: <i>I'm serious.</i>

33:51.112 --> 33:52.071
Where are we?

33:52.155 --> 33:54.282
Weeks and Keenan the day
Keenan was killed.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.575
KEENAN:<i> I just got a call.</i>

33:55.658 --> 33:58.369
<i>A couple of heights detectives</i>
<i>got caught stealing suits.</i>

33:58.453 --> 34:01.122
<i>-They're ratting each other out.</i>
-MEEKS: <i>Can that go anyplace?</i>

34:01.205 --> 34:02.290
KEENAN: <i>This is my point.</i>

34:02.373 --> 34:04.292
<i>We're the two people</i>
<i>that can hurt each other,</i>

34:04.375 --> 34:06.002
<i>and we can keep each other protected.</i>

34:06.085 --> 34:07.795
MEEKS: <i>Makes sense.</i>
<i>-</i>KEENAN: <i>Look</i>…

34:07.879 --> 34:11.174
<i>I don't figure you love me.</i>
<i>I got $5,000 for you.</i>

34:11.257 --> 34:16.220
-MEEKS: <i>(laughs) I'm very fond of you.</i>
<i>-</i>KEENAN: <i>You're fond of me,</i>

34:16.304 --> 34:19.140
<i>-but you don't love me.</i>
-MEEKS: <i>Sure, when you save your pennies.</i>

34:19.223 --> 34:20.892
<i>You saved that on a cop's salary?</i>

34:20.975 --> 34:23.853
KEENAN: <i>This is my point, Charlie.</i>
<i>I want to give you that every year.</i>

34:23.936 --> 34:26.856
<i>-I want to be around to give it to you.</i>
-MEEKS: <i>Same time next year, huh?</i>

34:26.939 --> 34:29.192
-KEENAN: <i>Let's make it an annual thing.</i>
<i>-</i>MEEKS: <i>That's great.</i>

34:29.275 --> 34:32.236
KEENAN: <i>I don't what to kill you, Weeks.</i>
<i>I want to live to enjoy my money,</i>

34:32.320 --> 34:34.614
<i>-and I don't wanna burn in hell, okay?</i>
<i>-</i>MEEKS: <i>What's the matter?</i>

34:34.697 --> 34:36.365
KEENAN: <i>I don't wanna think</i>
<i>about killing anyone,</i>

34:36.449 --> 34:38.618
<i>and I don't want to be looking over</i>
<i>my shoulder. You understand me?</i>

34:38.701 --> 34:40.620
MEEKS: <i>Calm down. We're okay.</i>

34:40.703 --> 34:43.247
-KEENAN: <i>Are we okay?</i>
-MEEKS: <i>We're okay. We're all right.</i>

34:43.331 --> 34:45.416
<i>-</i>KEENAN: <i>Are we all right?</i>
<i>-</i>MEEKS: <i>We're all right.</i>

34:45.500 --> 34:46.918
<i>Nobody's gonna kill anyone.</i>

34:47.835 --> 34:50.421
Weeks was scared.
He killed Keenan because he was scared.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.256
There's nothing to incriminate Daniels.

34:52.340 --> 34:53.549
Is that relief I hear, Frank?

34:53.633 --> 34:55.343
There's still three big envelopes
to go through.

34:56.052 --> 34:59.305
-Different agenda this time, Tony.
-NEAL: We want you to look at some names.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.516
You're kidding.
You'd get a hernia carrying this.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.559
Few minutes of your time.
Just shop around in there.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.561
We're looking for street shys.
Somebody who's looking

35:05.645 --> 35:07.313
-maybe to step up?
-The problem your cop had,

35:07.396 --> 35:09.357
nobody on the street's gonna
lend that kind of money.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.026
We could start with the A's.
Let's start with the R's.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.529
Fellas, there's like a 1,000 names here.

35:15.029 --> 35:17.782
Hey, J.D., how about that fire
at Deshay's last year?

35:18.491 --> 35:19.700
They ever find the torch?

35:19.784 --> 35:21.994
Ha ha ha. I was at the shore.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.714
All right, slow up
if you want me to look, huh?

35:33.798 --> 35:35.007
Sorry, my man.

35:36.926 --> 35:38.928
Roberts, no. Rothman.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.806
There's a kid who had a racket
falling down in malls.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.558
There's a guy fits: leg breaker.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.393
He was always looking to get into finance.

35:45.476 --> 35:46.727
Louis Russ?

35:46.811 --> 35:49.313
Black fella. No offense, Detective.

35:49.397 --> 35:52.024
You don't get too many your
color high-echelon shylocks.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.067
No initiative, huh?

35:53.151 --> 35:54.610
Who knows with that stuff.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.195
Let's try this guy Russ.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.072
Thanks for your time.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.198
Forget it.

36:01.033 --> 36:03.202
(siren wailing)

36:03.286 --> 36:05.371
(tires screech, siren stops)

36:07.123 --> 36:08.916
-Police!
-What happened?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.918
-David, they shot him!
-How is he?

36:11.002 --> 36:14.630
-He protect my mother.
-Who shot you, Trenton?

36:14.714 --> 36:16.382
His friend shot him!

36:16.465 --> 36:19.886
-Jody shoot you? He do you, Trenton?
-Let me get him to the hospital!

36:19.969 --> 36:21.888
You want to go to the hospital
with us, Mr. Pak?

36:21.971 --> 36:23.181
He protect my mother.

36:23.264 --> 36:26.350
I don't even trust him to make change!
(continues, indistinct)

36:26.434 --> 36:27.852
Mr. Pak! Come on, Mr. Pak!

36:27.935 --> 36:30.188
Trenton would be happy to see anybody!

36:30.271 --> 36:32.064
Very grateful. Ashamed now.

36:32.148 --> 36:35.610
(siren wailing)

36:35.693 --> 36:37.195
(tires squealing)

36:47.205 --> 36:48.456
Scuse.

37:02.678 --> 37:03.763
Sorry.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.647
You coming from Springfield?

37:16.317 --> 37:17.693
You live there?

37:17.777 --> 37:18.861
No.

37:19.654 --> 37:20.988
You live in the city?

37:24.742 --> 37:26.035
You want my pickle?

37:27.536 --> 37:29.413
Go ahead. You're hungry.
I can always feel it

37:29.497 --> 37:31.624
-when somebody's hungry.
-No, thank you.

37:36.837 --> 37:38.631
My niece had a birthday party.

37:41.634 --> 37:42.969
Want to see her picture?

37:52.311 --> 37:53.354
She's cute.

37:54.021 --> 37:55.064
How old?

37:55.147 --> 37:57.400
Nine months. Ain't she a doll?

37:59.068 --> 38:00.278
Oh, sorry.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.201
Let me try the pickle.

38:14.792 --> 38:18.170
Yeah, well, you tell Mr. Pierson
to call me as soon as he gets back.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.798
Now don't forget. Right away, huh? Okay.

38:20.881 --> 38:21.966
Sergeant?

38:22.049 --> 38:26.137
Yeah, Mrs. Furillo. Mr. Garibaldi?

38:26.220 --> 38:28.514
I wanted to get my son's things.

38:28.597 --> 38:30.224
Yeah, they've just been released.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.101
It's downstairs.

38:38.816 --> 38:42.445
There's a notebook,
a couple of other documents

38:42.528 --> 38:44.822
that the detectives want to hang on to.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.574
Mrs. Furillo said they think

38:46.657 --> 38:49.452
maybe Harry knew the person
that killed him.

38:49.535 --> 38:52.371
They think maybe that he was in trouble.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.958
I just know
what they're holding for evidence, sir.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.002
That's what I hear.

38:58.711 --> 38:59.879
That's the rumors.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.131
I don't believe it.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.509
Everything here has been cleared.

39:08.512 --> 39:12.016
Writ took me all of ten minutes, Captain.
Your bust doesn't work.

39:12.099 --> 39:13.768
-What bust?
-Louis Russ.

39:13.851 --> 39:14.977
This orders his release.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.979
This tells your detectives
not to follow him.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.356
This isn't Gulag, gentlemen.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.441
You don't make a deal at noon
and break it at 2:00!

39:20.524 --> 39:23.277
What's going on, Captain?
We brought this guy in for questioning.

39:23.361 --> 39:24.278
A tip by an informant.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.155
Are these freestyle or compulsories?

39:26.238 --> 39:27.615
So how about it? Can I go?

39:28.366 --> 39:31.077
Unless the Constitution's
been totally abrogated here.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.704
Check the writ, Stan.
If it's in order, let him go.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.956
Captain! Captain!

39:36.040 --> 39:39.126
-Captain, that slime killed Garibaldi!
-It's a court order, J.D.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.712
So we won't exactly follow him.
We'll stay 101 yards away from him.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.547
That wouldn't be following
the spirit of the order.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.716
I don't believe this.
You just turned the law inside out

39:45.800 --> 39:48.719
-to get us to pick the guy up!
-I won't go against a direct court order--

39:48.803 --> 39:51.180
There's still legal moves to play.
Maybe we can send a file to division--

39:51.263 --> 39:54.100
-Legal moves? Legal freaking moves?
-Cut it out, J.D.!

39:54.183 --> 39:56.769
Mr. Burhan! Yes, Howard Hunter here.

39:56.852 --> 39:58.521
Yes, I would...

39:58.604 --> 40:02.066
I'm ready to take that
yin in my yang, Mr. Burhan.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.318
I'm ready to take delivery of my Shar-Pei.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.904
8:00 would be excellent.

40:07.863 --> 40:09.782
Well, I suppose I could pay cash,

40:09.865 --> 40:11.909
although I would want
some sort of a record.

40:11.992 --> 40:17.289
-(gunshots)
-(women screaming)

40:17.373 --> 40:20.376
OFFICER: Let's go! Move! Move it!
OFFICER 2: Move! Move!

40:31.429 --> 40:32.721
The guy's dead, Captain.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.644
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:38.727 --> 40:39.979
I'm really, really sorry!

40:40.062 --> 40:42.481
It's all right. It's not your fault!
It's not your fault!

40:42.565 --> 40:44.358
I could have frisked him, too. Listen.

40:45.025 --> 40:46.110
(gasps)

40:48.446 --> 40:52.199
ANNOUNCER: <i>The express</i>
<i>from Springfield has just arrived</i>

40:52.283 --> 40:54.368
<i>at gate number 7.</i>

40:54.452 --> 40:58.205
<i>The express from Springfield</i>
<i>has just arrived...</i>

40:59.498 --> 41:00.541
Nizer.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.334
Belker, where you been?

41:03.002 --> 41:04.920
-I've been on a tail.
-Did you call in?

41:05.004 --> 41:07.882
-The guys at your precinct were worried.
-Forget that.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.550
What happened to chicken jacket?

41:09.633 --> 41:11.260
You were right. The guy's warm.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.429
He works with another guy.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.055
Where's the other guy?

41:15.139 --> 41:18.142
Deals out of a cab.
They're moving goods both ways.

41:18.225 --> 41:21.061
They stash in the lockers. Do we pop them?

41:21.896 --> 41:24.482
You take chicken jacket. This one's mine.

41:27.735 --> 41:31.655
(suspenseful music playing)

41:37.411 --> 41:39.997
(upbeat music playing)

41:40.998 --> 41:42.958
-Come on!
-(groans)

41:59.350 --> 42:01.143
Aah!

42:12.780 --> 42:14.990
Aah! Aah! Aah!

42:15.074 --> 42:16.408
Aah!

42:18.118 --> 42:20.246
Aah!

42:23.457 --> 42:24.500
You...

42:25.334 --> 42:27.127
are busted!

42:31.507 --> 42:32.675
There he is.

42:35.427 --> 42:36.845
Yo. Yo.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.514
You did a good thing, Trenton.

42:38.597 --> 42:39.807
Yeah, sure.

42:39.890 --> 42:41.684
I'll probably lose my damn job.

42:42.351 --> 42:45.229
-Pak will think I'm too much trouble.
-No, no.

42:45.312 --> 42:48.107
He's real grateful
for what you did, Trenton.

42:50.150 --> 42:53.779
I guess I'll go ahead and bring
those charges against Jody.

42:59.994 --> 43:01.245
Glad you came, Mr. Pak.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.296
How you feeling, Trenton?

43:11.672 --> 43:13.757
Uh, he's worried that you might fire him.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.509
-No.
-Tell him.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.429
I don't know what that is,
but you can't have it in a hospital.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.472
Is for patient.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.683
Not for any of my patients, it isn't.

43:22.766 --> 43:26.437
Um... Mr. Pak, why don't
you give this to the police?

43:27.229 --> 43:28.188
For police?

43:29.607 --> 43:30.566
Fine.

43:35.696 --> 43:38.365
I... sit with you, Trenton?

43:41.160 --> 43:42.077
Sure.

43:47.916 --> 43:49.084
(sighs)

43:50.794 --> 43:53.631
It is said that the extreme
elasticity of your skin

43:53.714 --> 43:57.509
enables you to invert yourself
in the jaws of an assailant

43:57.593 --> 44:00.387
and deliver a vicious counter-bite.

44:01.639 --> 44:03.766
Did you know that? Hmm?

44:04.850 --> 44:06.518
(chuckles)

44:06.602 --> 44:08.979
Oh, yes, I must say,

44:10.064 --> 44:14.276
you are almost zen-like
in the purity of your unattractiveness.

44:15.611 --> 44:16.862
Oh.

44:16.945 --> 44:18.364
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:19.281 --> 44:20.824
Did I hurt your feelings?

44:21.575 --> 44:23.994
I'm sorry. You are my favorite puppy.

44:24.662 --> 44:25.871
Yes.

44:25.954 --> 44:28.540
The soft little wrinkles.

44:28.624 --> 44:29.792
Mm-hmm.

44:31.126 --> 44:35.172
We-- we are going to have
such a good time together.

44:37.633 --> 44:40.552
And when you grow up, yes,

44:40.636 --> 44:45.057
you are going to have a harem
of beautiful Shar-Pei bitches.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.266
Yes, you are.

44:47.393 --> 44:50.521
No gender ambiguity here, huh, big fella?

44:50.604 --> 44:51.897
(puppy snorts)

44:57.986 --> 44:59.238
That's okay.

44:59.321 --> 45:01.657
It wasn't exactly how I wanted
to make the case.

45:01.740 --> 45:04.201
Only thing I'm sorry about
is the old man goes away.

45:05.160 --> 45:08.831
You start that vigilante stuff,
you and me both are out of jobs, lover.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.252
-J.D.
-Hey, how you doing, Lieutenant?

45:13.335 --> 45:15.462
Hey, Lieutenant, you've been
working with Buntz.

45:15.546 --> 45:16.672
He handle himself?

45:17.381 --> 45:18.549
He's okay.

45:18.632 --> 45:19.925
A little unorthodox.

45:21.051 --> 45:24.304
I don't like him. There, I told the truth.

45:24.930 --> 45:26.682
You know, it ain't like being married.

45:26.765 --> 45:28.434
You don't have to love the guy.

45:28.517 --> 45:30.728
Hmm. Good night.

45:30.811 --> 45:31.979
Hey, Lieutenant...

45:32.980 --> 45:33.981
You okay?

45:36.859 --> 45:38.694
You think that list was kind of short?

45:39.778 --> 45:40.988
Which?

45:41.071 --> 45:43.365
Oh, that V.D. list from this morning.

45:43.449 --> 45:46.201
It was a sweethearts list!

45:46.285 --> 45:47.411
My cousin's.

45:49.538 --> 45:52.332
You think 12 names is pretty short?

45:54.543 --> 45:57.212
Well, your cousin,
he hasn't had his last at-bats yet,

45:57.296 --> 45:58.255
has he, Lieutenant?

45:59.506 --> 46:00.591
Not yet.

46:00.674 --> 46:02.760
Hey, Lieutenant. What's happening?

46:02.843 --> 46:04.386
Hey, come on and pull up a stool.

46:05.345 --> 46:06.680
Thanks. Good night.

46:07.514 --> 46:08.515
Night, Lieutenant.

46:09.641 --> 46:10.768
Night, J.D.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.395
You know what these are, Irwin?

46:14.938 --> 46:18.692
These aren't anything Weeks did.
These are xeroxes of Keenan's records.

46:21.987 --> 46:23.614
Keenan's records?

46:23.697 --> 46:25.407
Day by day is what it looks like.

46:26.450 --> 46:27.993
Names, collections, payments.

46:28.994 --> 46:30.788
-(sighs)
-We got it, Irwin.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.751
Weeks. I love this guy.

46:35.834 --> 46:37.795
He stole, he believes in records.

46:38.796 --> 46:40.088
A prosecutor's dream.

46:41.006 --> 46:43.425
What's new in Pandora's box?

46:43.509 --> 46:44.843
Pretty interesting.

46:46.136 --> 46:48.305
Weeks must have xeroxed Keenan's files

46:48.388 --> 46:49.848
to have something extra on him.

46:50.432 --> 46:51.642
Here's an interesting page.

46:51.725 --> 46:54.478
Frank, there's six names
just on this page.

46:59.691 --> 47:01.693
You look like Cheshire cats.

47:03.362 --> 47:06.615
In memoriam to Louis Russ,
who gave you all this

47:06.698 --> 47:08.951
and had the good grace
to get himself killed.

47:12.704 --> 47:15.040
(telephone rings)

47:17.876 --> 47:18.752
Hello?

47:21.171 --> 47:22.047
When?

47:23.298 --> 47:25.676
No, take him directly to Michigan Avenue.

47:25.759 --> 47:28.554
Maximum security, 24 hours, right.

47:29.388 --> 47:30.305
Thanks.

47:35.435 --> 47:37.312
Division just picked up Charlie Weeks.

47:39.064 --> 47:40.399
May I say something?

47:41.441 --> 47:44.111
I think tomorrow, we're gonna be
pretty big heroes in this town.

47:44.194 --> 47:46.321
How about when you're hot, you're hot?

48:01.211 --> 48:05.215
(theme music playing)
