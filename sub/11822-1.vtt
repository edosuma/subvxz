00:56.400 --> 00:59.600
<i>Oh, I can't. I can't stay awake.
Stay awake, stay awake.</i>

00:59.900 --> 01:02.600
<i>Adderall, gone. Ritalin, gone.</i>

01:02.800 --> 01:04.099
<i>Amitriptyline. What is it?</i>

01:04.200 --> 01:07.900
<i>Modifinil, CNS. Dopamine.
A stimulant. Clonazepam.</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
<i>Clonazepam, good.
That's right. Yes. Good.</i>

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
<i>Citric acid, yes.</i>

01:12.400 --> 01:15.300
<i>Oh, sugar, sugar. Fructose.
Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew.</i>

01:17.100 --> 01:19.100
Let us out! Please!

01:19.200 --> 01:22.800
<i>Who are those people? Who are they?
What are they trying to do to us?</i>

01:22.900 --> 01:24.700
<i>No one's ever gonna hurt my son.</i>

01:24.900 --> 01:27.000
<i>I can't stay awake. Please stay awake.</i>

01:27.200 --> 01:29.500
<i>Yes, you can, yes, you can.
I know you can.</i>

01:29.700 --> 01:32.700
<i>Stay awake. Yes, you can.
Come on, come on.</i>

01:38.800 --> 01:40.700
Let us out!

01:42.200 --> 01:45.300
Open the door! Open it! Open the door!

02:01.200 --> 02:04.600
<i>Tragic news tonight as
the space shuttle Patriot explodes...</i>

02:04.800 --> 02:07.000
<i>...during an unscheduled
landing attempt...</i>

02:07.200 --> 02:09.199
<i>We felt, you know, the explosion.</i>

02:09.300 --> 02:12.300
<i>- a trail of destruction and debris
from Dallas to Washington.</i>

02:12.500 --> 02:15.100
<i>Pieces all over the pasture
and in the yard, everywhere.</i>

02:15.200 --> 02:18.300
<i>Watching it, make sure nobody touches it,
nobody runs off with it.</i>

02:18.500 --> 02:21.100
<i>Why is it important for people
not to touch it?</i>

02:21.200 --> 02:23.300
<i>It's contaminated.
Could be contaminated.</i>

02:23.500 --> 02:26.700
<i>Of course, we all got out and we touched it,
some of us did.</i>

02:27.000 --> 02:28.800
<i>Crucial questions remain unanswered.</i>

02:29.000 --> 02:30.900
<i>Debris has been seen
from Dallas to Washington.</i>

02:31.000 --> 02:33.900
<i>The shuttle accident has shocked
the nation and the world.</i>

02:34.100 --> 02:37.100
<i>Impromptu memorials can be seen
where debris has fallen.</i>

02:37.300 --> 02:38.800
<i>The scene here is surreal.</i>

02:39.000 --> 02:43.200
<i>We've seen a stream of officials from a
number of federal agencies coming through.</i>

02:49.600 --> 02:51.100
- Kaufman, CDC?
- That's right.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.300
Right this way, please.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.500
Mr. Kaufman!

02:53.700 --> 02:57.500
Dina Twain from CNN. Can I ask you what
the CDC is doing here, Mr. Kaufman?

03:02.100 --> 03:05.100
Hi. President's on his way back
to D.C. tonight.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.800
I'm supposed to brief him at 6 a. m.
Can we make that?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.500
- We can try.
- Right. Show me what you have.

03:12.100 --> 03:13.400
Over the retrieved debris...

03:13.600 --> 03:16.800
...we're recording a contamination rate
of almost every square meter.

03:16.900 --> 03:20.700
We're projecting a contamination zone
of an alley about 200 miles wide...

03:20.900 --> 03:23.200
...from D.C. to Dallas.
- My God. What is it?

03:23.700 --> 03:27.800
Our biotechs are in full meltdown mode.
This is a highly resilient organism...

03:27.900 --> 03:31.700
...able to survive the bitter cold of space
and the searing heat of reentry.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.300
Initial cellular diagnostics show
it exhibits monoploid characteristics...

03:35.500 --> 03:37.800
...with high levels
of calcium dipicolinate...

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
...both commonalities to an endospore.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.900
A spore? Jesus.

03:43.300 --> 03:47.400
One thing's for sure,
it ain't from around here.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.200
Sir! This was on our roof.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.200
<i>The president is on his way back
to Washington from Camp David...</i>

04:11.400 --> 04:14.600
<i>...to meet with his closest advisors
over the space-shuttle disaster.</i>

04:21.899 --> 04:23.200
Hey, Casper.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.200
Good boy.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.200
I thought you'd never get home.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.300
Your ex-wife called twice.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.900
Do you wanna watch this?
I mean, for work or something?

04:39.500 --> 04:41.000
I should get to bed.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.900
I gotta be back on the Hill
in a few hours.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.400
Well, you should've called. I could've
been sleeping in my own bed right now.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
<i>Federal officials are removing
several pieces of shuttle debris...</i>

04:54.200 --> 04:56.100
<i>...from a disturbing source: eBay.</i>

05:54.000 --> 05:55.200
Ollie!

05:55.400 --> 05:57.800
Ollie, it's okay. It's okay.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.400
Look at me. It's Mommy.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.600
Oh, baby.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.400
Oh, hey.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.200
It's okay.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.200
It's okay.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.400
You just had a bad dream.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.400
You got those nightmares
back again, huh?

06:13.900 --> 06:16.000
Everything's all right. You lie down.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.300
There we go.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.600
There we go.

06:22.300 --> 06:26.100
We'll just have to make those
nightmares go away again.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.000
Right?

06:32.700 --> 06:35.900
<i>Hundreds were killed this morning
in the bloodiest attack in Iraq...</i>

06:36.100 --> 06:37.900
<i>...since the start of the occupation.</i>

06:38.000 --> 06:41.200
<i>A mixture of toxic chemicals
was strapped to suicide bombers...</i>

06:45.700 --> 06:48.400
Ollie? Breakfast.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.900
<i>Dr. Bennell? I have a call for you.</i>

06:58.400 --> 06:59.900
I'm just finishing my notes.

07:00.100 --> 07:03.000
<i>- I know, but he is very insistent.
- Who is it?</i>

07:03.100 --> 07:04.900
<i>Your ex-husband.</i>

07:09.100 --> 07:11.700
- Hello?
- Carol, how are you?

07:12.400 --> 07:14.200
I'm fine, Tucker. How are you?

07:14.700 --> 07:17.100
I am fine. I'm really fine.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.600
I'm back in D.C. again.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.400
In our old house.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.200
It is such a nice house.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.700
What do you want, Tucker?

07:30.100 --> 07:31.600
I want to see Oliver.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.500
<i>- I miss him.
- No.</i>

07:34.800 --> 07:37.600
Carol, I have a legal right to see my son.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.200
Ollie, I don't believe it. Come on.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.700
Get dressed. We got 15 minutes.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.100
Come on.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.500
We should walk to school every morning.
This is nice.

07:56.700 --> 07:59.000
You wouldn't say that if it was raining.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.500
If it were raining.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.100
But what if it rains tonight?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.600
I checked the weather report.
Forty-five and clear. No rain.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.900
Just candy.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.200
Okay, here's your homework.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.900
- All right.
- You look cool.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.100
Thanks.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.100
- I'll see you at 4.
- All right.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.300
Can I give you a kiss?

08:25.900 --> 08:28.200
- Hey, Oliver!
- Nice costume, dude.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.100
I'm gonna get a double Hershey's bar.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.200
Oh, I wanna get as much chocolate...

08:32.400 --> 08:33.900
<i>America is in shock today...</i>

08:34.100 --> 08:36.900
50 scientists have resigned
over this shuttle debacle.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.200
- Good morning, Ben.
- Fifty. Five-oh.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.200
They signed a letter saying
the government's ignoring them...

08:42.299 --> 08:44.700
...because they think
the shuttle crashed on purpose.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.000
No one's reporting it here.
I had to find it on the World Service.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.300
What's wrong with you?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.800
Tucker takes off to Atlanta
for four years, Ben.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.700
He calls Ollie on his birthday
and at Christmas...

09:00.800 --> 09:05.700
...and suddenly he comes back into his life
and he wants to be a good father. No.

09:06.900 --> 09:09.000
It's confusing for Ollie.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.400
He is his dad.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.300
I know him, and I don't trust him.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.300
Look, Oliver loves you more
than anything else on earth...

09:17.500 --> 09:21.000
...and there is nothing that Tucker
or anybody else can do to change that.

09:23.500 --> 09:27.000
<i>Hard work! Fair pay! Hard work! Fair pay!</i>

09:29.400 --> 09:32.100
- Are we still on for tomorrow night?
- Will there be food?

09:32.300 --> 09:35.300
Well, they're Czechs, so there'll be,
what, goulash or something.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.500
We'll see.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.200
Spare some change, ma'am?

09:44.300 --> 09:45.700
God bless.

09:51.200 --> 09:53.000
Why would I get you flowers?

09:53.600 --> 09:56.200
Well, I didn't do anything wrong.
Hold on, hold on.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.100
That'll be 8 bucks.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.500
I am all about the romance.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.700
- Morning, Carly.
- Your 9:00 is here.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.900
You're a little early, Wendy.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.800
It's my husband.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.800
Wendy, did something happen?

10:34.800 --> 10:36.300
Did your husband hurt you again?

10:37.800 --> 10:39.800
How long have I been coming here?

10:40.100 --> 10:41.500
Four years.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.200
And I've had a cup of tea
almost every time, haven't I?

10:45.900 --> 10:47.400
Yeah, I suppose you have.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.200
But I can't do it.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.900
I can't even drink this.
That's how bad it's gotten.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.700
I wanna help you,
but you have to talk to me.

11:03.900 --> 11:07.200
This is gonna sound so stupid,
or crazy, or both.

11:07.300 --> 11:13.200
No, I've told you before. Nothing you say
in this office is stupid or crazy.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.200
All of it's important. All of it matters.

11:18.300 --> 11:19.800
My husband is not my husband.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.400
And what makes you say that?

11:23.500 --> 11:26.500
The way he acts.
The way he looks at me.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.200
He keeps bringing me things to drink.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.800
I don't want them,
but he keeps bringing them.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.500
I yelled at him last night.
He didn't yell back.

11:35.700 --> 11:39.100
I threw my glass at him
and he didn't do anything.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.900
I know you and your husband
have a volatile relationship.

11:42.100 --> 11:44.100
I did, but not anymore.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.600
Yes, when he would get mad,
I would be afraid of him.

11:48.700 --> 11:52.900
But at least when he kissed me,
I knew he loved me.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.500
Now when he kisses me...

11:56.400 --> 11:58.100
What is it?

11:58.800 --> 12:00.700
He's just different.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.900
I know it. Bobo knew it too.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.100
Bobo, your dog?

12:05.300 --> 12:10.000
The other night, when Richard got
home from work and he walked in...

12:10.500 --> 12:12.700
...Bobo, he just went crazy.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.600
He started snapping
and growling at Richard.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.600
I mean, we tried to put him outside,
but he attacked.

12:18.700 --> 12:22.600
Dr. Bennell, that dog has never
attacked anyone in its life.

12:22.800 --> 12:23.900
And what happened?

12:25.400 --> 12:26.900
Richard...

12:28.500 --> 12:30.700
...grabbed the dog's neck...

12:31.900 --> 12:35.700
...and Bobo just started whimpering.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.700
I tried to stop him,
but he wouldn't let go.

12:39.900 --> 12:43.000
And then, I could tell. Bobo, he...

12:43.100 --> 12:47.000
...he didn't understand what was
happening. He was so scared.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.500
And then there was this snap...

12:49.700 --> 12:51.300
...and Bobo was dead.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.300
Richard didn't say anything.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.600
He didn't cry.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.100
He just picked Bobo up...

13:00.200 --> 13:03.200
...and took him out to the garbage.

13:09.900 --> 13:13.200
I wanna see you again
as soon as possible.

13:13.900 --> 13:17.600
I'm gonna change your medication. I want
you to take these morning and night...

13:18.000 --> 13:19.900
...twice a day. Okay?

13:20.900 --> 13:25.300
And if your husband does anything like this
again, anything that frightens you at all...

13:25.500 --> 13:29.100
...I want you to call my service immediately.
Can you promise you'll do that?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.700
Yes. Thank you, doctor.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.200
That should work.

13:35.700 --> 13:39.200
Now, we should probably
talk about tomorrow.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.100
Are you nervous?

13:43.300 --> 13:44.700
Why would I be nervous?

13:44.900 --> 13:47.700
Because we've never
been apart like this, Ollie.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.700
And you haven't seen much
of your dad in a long time.

13:50.900 --> 13:55.100
I'm okay, Mom. It's gonna be fun.
But I'm gonna miss you.

13:55.300 --> 13:56.600
Yeah, you better.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.000
We can text each other all the time.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.300
You're right, I'm being silly. You go pack.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.100
We're gonna meet the Welches
in about half an hour.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.000
Go on, Superman.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.800
Thank you, Mrs. Robinson!

14:12.300 --> 14:13.400
Bye-bye.

14:13.600 --> 14:14.600
Thank you!

14:15.100 --> 14:16.700
Thank you.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.300
Trick or treat! Trick or treat!

14:22.200 --> 14:24.900
He's having nightmares again.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.000
I got him back on clonazepam.
I hate having him on anything.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.800
When did he start having them?

14:30.000 --> 14:33.900
The last three nights. Ever since
he's known he's gonna see his dad.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.800
Trick or treat! Trick or treat!

14:43.800 --> 14:45.100
Get back, boys.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.200
Stop that!

14:48.400 --> 14:51.500
She's been acting up. Maybe you
should take them to another house.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.400
I don't know what's wrong with her.

14:56.600 --> 14:57.800
Come on, boys.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.700
Let's go.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.100
- Blue, get back here!
- Watch it!

15:03.200 --> 15:05.700
Watch it!
Oh, my God, get him off!

15:06.700 --> 15:08.800
- Ollie, back!
- Blue! Get down.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.500
Down, girl. Bad dog. Bad dog!
I'm so sorry.

15:12.700 --> 15:15.300
- I'm so sorry.
- Andy! Andy. Oh, my God.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.300
He's fine, Pam.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.200
There's nothing there.
The blood must've been the dog's.

15:25.700 --> 15:26.700
Well.

15:26.900 --> 15:29.500
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay, Mom.

15:29.900 --> 15:30.900
Okay.

15:31.100 --> 15:34.200
You took my candy.
Give me that Snickers!

15:34.400 --> 15:36.000
- That's mine.
- I want that.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.265
- No, you can have that.
- Give me that!

15:38.300 --> 15:41.900
- I'll trade you. Here, Russell's for Reese's.
- Oh, man.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.200
Thanks, Carol.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.600
How's Andy doing in school?

15:45.700 --> 15:47.200
He seems a little disconnected.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.900
Jeez, Carol. I mean, usually when
you start talking like a psychiatrist...

15:51.100 --> 15:53.900
...it's not about one of my children.

15:54.800 --> 15:59.400
Oh, he's just in a funk. You know, maybe
it's that bug that's been going around.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.800
- What's going around?
- Mom!

16:02.100 --> 16:05.200
Mom! Get this off of me, please! Mom!

16:05.400 --> 16:08.700
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.700
- What is that?
- I think it moved.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.000
Did one of you put this here?

16:16.300 --> 16:18.500
- Not me.
- I didn't.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.400
Would you mind taking Gene home?

16:33.800 --> 16:34.800
Taxi!

16:41.400 --> 16:43.400
Carol. What are you doing here?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.600
Hey.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.000
That's for me?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.700
It's...

16:54.600 --> 16:55.700
I love it.

16:55.900 --> 16:59.800
There's no way of telling which house it
came from because we went to at least 30.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.100
I don't think there's anything
to worry about. It looks like latex.

17:03.300 --> 17:07.000
Ben, look at it. Even without a microscope,
you can see the cell strata.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.500
Well, maybe someone used
a finger as a mold.

17:10.700 --> 17:13.800
Someone's definitely made this
or bought it at Wal-Mart.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.000
I mean, it is Halloween.
It could be anything.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.400
What do you think, Steven?

17:24.599 --> 17:26.000
Interesting.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.500
It's manufactured, right?

17:27.700 --> 17:31.400
I don't know. It's either an expensive fake
or really cheap skin.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.500
Med Web's buzzing
with something like this.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.300
Labs in New York and Boston
logged some weird samples.

17:37.500 --> 17:38.800
Let me do a workup on it.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.100
- Thanks for helping, Steven.
- Yeah.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.900
Call me later, Ben.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.300
- You owe me an hour on your couch.
- An hour?

17:46.400 --> 17:49.100
What makes you think
anyone can help you in an hour?

17:52.400 --> 17:55.600
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

17:56.900 --> 18:00.000
<i>Each year, the flu claims
tens of thousands of American lives.</i>

18:01.300 --> 18:03.300
<i>You'd figure the government
would realize...</i>

18:03.400 --> 18:07.400
<i>...that we are facing nothing less
than a national medical emergency.</i>

18:07.500 --> 18:11.300
Our studies show this new virus
is more communicable...

18:11.600 --> 18:14.500
...and lasts longer than
more common strains of flu.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.300
<i>The CDC has begun
emergency meetings today...</i>

18:17.500 --> 18:20.100
<i>...to decide how to keep it
from getting any worse.</i>

18:20.300 --> 18:22.500
We think an inoculation program is our...

18:23.700 --> 18:26.100
Our best shot at keeping this
under our thumb.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.100
<i>This flu season could be
the deadliest in 30 years.</i>

18:31.600 --> 18:32.900
I'm curious.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.900
If you just cracked this new virus...

18:35.000 --> 18:37.400
...how are you ready
with vaccines so quickly?

18:37.900 --> 18:40.800
I wish there were more time to go over...

18:41.000 --> 18:44.500
...all of the science and the internal
processes behind this project.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.200
If you require more information...

18:46.700 --> 18:49.400
...I'd suggest you bow out
of this round of contracts...

18:49.600 --> 18:51.900
...and give us some time
to prepare a fact sheet.

18:52.500 --> 18:56.500
Is that what you'd like,
Mrs. Cunningham?

18:57.900 --> 19:00.200
Not at all. Just a question.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.000
Well, we like those.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.600
We like questions.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.800
They got you to the moon.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.900
Carol?

19:22.700 --> 19:25.600
That man wouldn't give a name.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.465
Can I help you?

19:31.500 --> 19:34.100
Dr. Bennell, I'm Richard Lenk,
Wendy Lenk's husband.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.200
What can I do for you, Mr. Lenk?

19:37.300 --> 19:39.100
I'm waiting for my wife.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.900
I don't think your wife
is coming in today.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.800
She said she was coming in,
but I'm bringing her home.

19:47.800 --> 19:51.100
Why don't you take a seat, Mr. Lenk,
and I'll see what I can find out.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.800
Thank you, Carol Bennell.

20:19.800 --> 20:24.200
<i>- Yes?
- Wendy, it's Dr. Bennell. Where are you?</i>

20:24.500 --> 20:27.000
<i>I am... I'm right outside your building.</i>

20:27.200 --> 20:29.200
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

20:29.400 --> 20:32.600
<i>Or maybe I should talk to the police
if you think I should.</i>

20:32.700 --> 20:35.700
Wendy, your husband's here.
He's in the waiting room.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.800
He said you were coming in.
I didn't want you to be surprised.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.700
<i>Carol, can you keep him there a while?</i>

20:45.900 --> 20:48.000
<i>- What are you gonna do?
- I'll go home and pack.</i>

20:48.200 --> 20:49.300
<i>I'll stay with my sister.</i>

20:50.700 --> 20:52.900
I didn't know if I could trust you.
Thank you.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.000
Trust me?

20:55.200 --> 20:58.000
Wendy. Wendy.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.600
<i>Your 9:00 is here.</i>

21:02.800 --> 21:03.900
Send her in.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.400
<i>What about Mr. Lenk?</i>

21:07.100 --> 21:09.000
<i>Dr. Bennell?</i>

21:10.200 --> 21:11.900
Give him a magazine.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.800
Did you tell Gene
you're staying at your dad's...

21:17.000 --> 21:18.200
...starting tonight?
- Yep.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.000
It's a good thing
he still lives next door, huh?

21:21.200 --> 21:24.600
Imagine the pickle you'd be in if you
didn't know any kids in the neighborhood.

21:24.800 --> 21:25.900
Pickle.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.200
- Bread-and-butter.
- Dill.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.600
- Kosher.
- Sour.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.300
- Sweet and hots.
- Gherkins.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.100
Garlic chips. Perkies!

21:34.600 --> 21:36.100
That's not one.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.900
Come on. Perkies?

21:39.100 --> 21:40.200
Anyway, you already won.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.800
But why do people say
"in a pickle" anyhow?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.200
- I think it's a baseball term.
- Mom!

21:45.400 --> 21:46.600
Help me, please!

21:48.600 --> 21:50.200
Help me!

21:50.600 --> 21:51.900
They're coming!

21:52.500 --> 21:53.800
Listen.

21:54.100 --> 21:55.500
We've gotta warn people!

21:57.200 --> 21:58.900
They're among us! They're here!

21:59.100 --> 22:01.100
- Mom, what's wrong with her?
- Stop!

22:05.400 --> 22:07.800
Oliver, you listen to me.
You stay put.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.900
- All right?
- Okay.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.300
- Ma'am!
- I'm a doctor.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.900
Go back to your car.
I gotta clear the traffic out of this tunnel.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.800
I saw it happen.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
Where would you like me to wait
for a statement? I'm a witness.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.200
I took down your plates.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.900
Well, hold on.
Why did you take down my plates?

22:46.300 --> 22:48.500
Why did you take down my plates?

22:48.700 --> 22:51.200
If we need you, we'll be in touch.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.300
Hey.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.700
Sorry we're late.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.500
Hey, Oliver.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.300
He had a rough night.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.900
We saw an accident. It was terrible.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.200
It's okay.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.400
School starts at 8:10.
You have to have him there at 8.

23:19.700 --> 23:21.000
Do you want to come in?

23:21.500 --> 23:23.300
No, I'm late for a party.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.300
Enjoy the party.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.800
Make sure you take your pills.
One every night.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.900
Okay. Love you.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.900
It was awful.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.800
You should've seen her face.
She was terrified, Ben.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.900
And the police did nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

24:00.100 --> 24:02.100
I offered to give my name, be a witness.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.600
And Oliver, he saw the whole thing.

24:04.700 --> 24:06.500
Is he all right?

24:06.700 --> 24:09.900
I mean, he seemed all right,
but I had to leave him.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.000
We don't have to do this tonight.
I can take you home.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.500
No, I want to. I want to.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.400
- You sure?
- I'm good, yes. Let's have fun.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.700
This is meant to be fun.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.900
You look stunning.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.300
Good evening, Dr. Ben.

24:34.500 --> 24:36.600
- How are you?
- Fine, fine.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.500
- Oh, that might be Ollie.
- May I take your coat?

24:39.700 --> 24:41.900
- Thank you.
- The ambassador and his wife are waiting.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.300
<i>Hi, Mom.
I miss you. Gene wants to say hi.</i>

24:45.500 --> 24:46.800
<i>Hi, Miss Bennell.</i>

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
<i>- Bye. I love you.
- Bye.</i>

24:50.900 --> 24:54.100
- May I take your coat, madam?
- Thank you.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.800
You are Carol.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.500
Carol Bennell, this is Dr. Henryk Belicec
and his wonderful wife, Luddie.

25:02.700 --> 25:07.000
Come here and let me see you.
Ben has told us a lot about you.

25:07.300 --> 25:10.800
Let us go in. Dinner will be ready soon.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.600
Now, you two sit with us.

25:12.800 --> 25:15.800
We want some real people
around us tonight.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.800
- Something's wrong with my dad.
- Yeah.

25:25.700 --> 25:27.500
Mine too.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.300
- Dad?
- In here, Oliver.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.900
I'm making some hot chocolate.

25:48.700 --> 25:51.100
Would you like some hot chocolate?

26:04.800 --> 26:09.000
So Ben tells me that
you are a psychiatrist.

26:09.200 --> 26:12.300
This is very interesting.
This is exactly what I need.

26:12.500 --> 26:15.700
You need what every Czech needs:
a stiff Russian boot up your behind.

26:15.900 --> 26:19.300
Pity they don't make Russian boots
anymore. They're all made in China.

26:19.400 --> 26:23.100
You seat me beside a beautiful woman
without introducing me, and you insult me.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.700
Oh, don't let him get started, Henyo.

26:25.900 --> 26:28.100
I'm sorry, Yorish. My humblest apologies.

26:28.600 --> 26:32.500
You have the honor of meeting one of
Washington's most notorious diplomats.

26:32.900 --> 26:36.600
My friend and the source
of this exquisite caviar...

26:36.800 --> 26:38.700
...Russian Ambassador
Yorish Kaganovich.

26:38.900 --> 26:42.500
- Nice to meet you, ambassador.
- The pleasure is entirely mine.

26:42.700 --> 26:45.500
Henryk's guests are usually
as old and as ugly as I am.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.400
I beg to differ.
No one's as ugly as you are, Yorish.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.700
You know what "Czechoslovakia"
means in Russian, doctor?

26:51.900 --> 26:53.500
It means a "doormat. "

26:53.600 --> 26:56.600
Someone still speaks Russian?
I thought it was a dead language.

26:57.500 --> 27:01.400
My cheeky friend and I pretend to enjoy
ourselves, but secretly we are rivals...

27:01.600 --> 27:05.500
...exploiting each other for personal gain.
I am here to drink his champagne...

27:05.700 --> 27:08.700
...and he invites me
because I can get the real caviar.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.300
A veneer of civility hides
our true self-interests.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.400
It's the nature of our world, yes?

27:14.600 --> 27:16.100
Yorish, be good.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.600
I'm only curious.

27:17.800 --> 27:21.000
I say that civilization is an illusion,
a game of pretend.

27:21.100 --> 27:25.400
What is real is the fact that we are
still animals, driven by primal instincts.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.900
As a psychiatrist...

27:28.100 --> 27:29.700
...you must know this to be true.

27:29.800 --> 27:34.000
To be honest, ambassador, when someone
starts talking to me about the truth...

27:34.200 --> 27:36.400
...I hear what they
tell me about themselves...

27:36.600 --> 27:38.700
...more than what they
say about the world.

27:38.900 --> 27:41.100
- Quite right. Well done.
- Perhaps you are right.

27:41.300 --> 27:44.500
Perhaps being a Russian in this country
is a kind of pathology.

27:44.700 --> 27:47.400
So, what do you think? Can you help me?

27:48.100 --> 27:49.800
Can you give me a pill?

27:49.900 --> 27:52.900
To make me see the world the way
you Americans see the world?

27:53.200 --> 27:57.800
Can a pill help me understand Iraq,
or Darfur, or even New Orleans?

27:58.000 --> 28:00.600
Don't be drawn in
by his madness, doctor.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.765
He is Russian. He needs to argue
like he needs to breathe.

28:03.800 --> 28:07.700
All I am saying is that civilization
crumbles whenever we need it most.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.200
In the right situation...

28:11.400 --> 28:14.100
...we are all capable
of the most terrible crimes.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.000
To imagine a world
where this was not so...

28:17.200 --> 28:19.900
...where every crisis did not result
in new atrocities...

28:20.100 --> 28:23.000
...where every newspaper
is not full of war and violence...

28:23.200 --> 28:28.700
Well, this is to imagine a world
where human beings cease to be human.

28:29.100 --> 28:32.400
While I'll give you that we still retain
some basic animal instincts...

28:32.600 --> 28:36.200
...you must admit we're not the same
animal we were a few thousand years ago.

28:36.300 --> 28:38.500
- True.
- Read Piaget or Kohlberg...

28:38.700 --> 28:41.800
...or Maslow, Graves, Wilber,
and you'll see we're still evolving.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Our consciousness is changing.

28:44.500 --> 28:47.300
Five hundred years ago,
postmodern feminists didn't exist...

28:47.400 --> 28:49.400
...yet one sits right beside you today.

28:49.500 --> 28:54.600
While that fact may not undo all the terrible
things that have been done in this world...

28:54.800 --> 28:58.200
...at least it gives me reason to believe
one day things may be different.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.900
- Thank you, doctor.
- You're welcome, ambassador.

29:02.300 --> 29:03.600
Excellent.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.500
Ben, of all the women
you've brought into our home...

29:06.600 --> 29:08.900
...this is the one
we permit you to marry.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.200
Hey, now, look.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.900
I've been watching
the way you look at each other.

29:13.100 --> 29:16.500
- Oh, so beautiful and smart.
- You see, this is what happens.

29:16.700 --> 29:20.600
They say what they like in this household,
and then they claim diplomatic immunity.

29:20.700 --> 29:23.400
- Think of the children you could have.
- Enough. Enough.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.400
I had a terrific time.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.300
Your friends are wonderful.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.400
Well, thank you for being my date.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.300
And for what you said tonight.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.300
What?

30:16.300 --> 30:17.900
No, I can't do this.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.300
No. That's...

30:19.500 --> 30:21.600
But that's... But that's fine.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.700
I'm sorry...

30:24.900 --> 30:27.100
...but I really need us
to stay what we are.

30:29.800 --> 30:32.700
You're my best friend,
and I can't lose that.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.100
Hey. Look, I...

30:37.100 --> 30:41.300
I just took advantage of a drunk woman,
and I'm sorry.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.200
- Now, can you walk?
- Hey!

30:44.300 --> 30:45.800
I can.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.300
Hey.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.700
Carol Bennell?

31:39.400 --> 31:41.100
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

31:41.300 --> 31:44.600
I need to ask you a few questions
for the Census Department.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.200
We're doing a census
of your district this month.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.400
Not the extended paper census, but a quick
door-to-door version to update our records.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.800
- At this time of night?
- Deadline.

31:53.900 --> 31:56.200
We're working all night now.
You're my last house.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.000
I saw your light. I came a few times.

32:01.300 --> 32:05.200
Listen, let me get that.
And then you can ask me through the door.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.900
Hey!

32:52.400 --> 32:57.100
<i>We're sorry. All circuits are busy.
Please hang up and try your call again.</i>

33:03.800 --> 33:05.200
Hey, Ben.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.000
It's me.

33:08.300 --> 33:11.900
I just... Somebody just scared
the shit out of me.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.100
Hey. Morning.

33:23.300 --> 33:24.700
Hey.

33:24.900 --> 33:27.700
- What did the police say?
- Not that much.

33:28.900 --> 33:32.100
- Carol, you're not going to work.
- I've got back-to-backs all day.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.900
At least stay and have some breakfast.
I cooked pancakes.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.600
What?

33:42.500 --> 33:45.300
<i>The thawing in tension between
Washington and Tehran...</i>

33:45.500 --> 33:49.600
<i>...over the enrichment of nuclear fuel
was one of the first steps...</i>

33:49.700 --> 33:51.500
<i>...by the U.S. to relax years...</i>

33:51.700 --> 33:54.100
<i>Morning, Mom. On the way to school.</i>

33:54.300 --> 33:56.600
<i>I still miss you. Love you. Bye.</i>

34:34.400 --> 34:35.900
Sorry I'm late.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.500
Courtney Jones canceled.
So did Chris Cook.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.199
What about Wendy Lenk?

34:42.400 --> 34:44.500
I haven't heard from her.

34:45.300 --> 34:48.199
Maybe it's that flu going around.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.100
I'll call her.

34:56.400 --> 35:00.300
Mr. Lenk, this is Dr. Bennell.
I was hoping I could speak with your wife.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.600
This is her cell phone I'm calling.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.400
<i>She's asleep right now.</i>

35:06.200 --> 35:08.700
Is everything all right, Mr. Lenk?

35:08.800 --> 35:12.400
<i>Everything's fine,
better than it's been in a long time.</i>

35:12.600 --> 35:14.000
<i>Wendy's fine now.</i>

35:14.200 --> 35:17.300
<i>I'll give her the message you called,
and she'll tell you herself.</i>

35:17.400 --> 35:19.300
<i>- Mr. Lenk?
- Yes?</i>

35:19.500 --> 35:23.600
If I don't hear from your wife soon,
I will be calling back. Do you understand?

35:23.900 --> 35:26.200
<i>You'll hear from her
by the end of the day.</i>

35:32.800 --> 35:33.900
It's my husband.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.600
Ben, they can't all be psychotic.

35:49.300 --> 35:52.100
<i>What if what they're saying is real?</i>

35:52.300 --> 35:54.300
Have you noticed anything?

35:57.800 --> 35:59.200
I have.

36:01.600 --> 36:03.100
What?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.800
He seems a little disconnected.

36:24.200 --> 36:27.900
- Hey, Carly.
- I thought you might like some tea.

36:28.900 --> 36:29.900
Thanks.

36:30.700 --> 36:34.400
Would you keep trying my ex-husband
until you get through? Okay?

36:34.500 --> 36:37.000
- It's important that I speak with him.
- All right.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.200
It's new.

36:38.900 --> 36:42.600
Like that orange pekoe you like.
Tell me what you think.

36:51.700 --> 36:52.700
Hey.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.800
Okay, dig this.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.400
Now, the best way I can describe
the sample that you brought me...

36:58.600 --> 37:01.600
...is a kind of post-infection sweat,
like a night sweat.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.500
Only, instead of evaporating,
this solidified.

37:04.700 --> 37:09.300
A percentage is spent white blood cells,
like you'd find in any normal infection.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.600
But, then, another percentage is...

37:11.800 --> 37:14.500
...hormones a body produces
when it enters REM sleep...

37:14.600 --> 37:17.200
...suggesting that the hormones
acted as a catalyst...

37:17.300 --> 37:20.700
...in some kind of metabolic reaction,
and then were expelled as waste.

37:20.735 --> 37:22.800
Yeah, but a reaction to what?

37:23.700 --> 37:26.200
A reaction to these.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.200
These are also spent cells.
Exploded, actually.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.800
- Are they viral?
- Viral-like, but larger than any virus known.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.100
Now, I tried to destroy some of them.

37:37.400 --> 37:42.200
I heated them up to see when they'd
incinerate. Took them up to 700 degrees.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.500
They survived.

37:43.700 --> 37:45.500
- Well, that's impossible.
- Yeah.

37:45.700 --> 37:49.100
Remember Ted Fraddo? He's out
at the lab at Fort Detrick now.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.900
They've settled on a hypothesis
that we're dealing with...

37:52.100 --> 37:55.300
...a complete, intelligent entity,
the dimensions of a few cells...

37:55.500 --> 37:58.200
...that's invading people's bodies,
integrating their DNA...

37:58.400 --> 38:00.700
...and reprogramming
their genetic expression.

38:00.900 --> 38:03.300
Reprogramming? How?
How would that look?

38:03.400 --> 38:06.900
Eighty percent of what we are
is determined by our genetic expression.

38:07.000 --> 38:10.000
Integration of alien DNA
could look like anything.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.800
Or nothing at all.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.100
So you say that this is
showing up all over?

38:15.200 --> 38:16.600
It's starting to.

38:16.800 --> 38:20.100
They began considering epidemic protocols
in Europe last night.

38:20.300 --> 38:23.900
Also in Japan, but here,
they're just talking about this flu.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.200
- Hello?
- Hello, Ben. This is Luddie.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.700
I'm so sorry to call you,
but I didn't know what else to do.

38:34.800 --> 38:37.500
<i>- Well, what's happened, Luddie?
- It's our friend Yorish.</i>

38:37.700 --> 38:39.300
Something's happening to him.

38:39.500 --> 38:41.100
<i>Something terrible.</i>

38:41.300 --> 38:42.400
We'll be right over.

38:45.600 --> 38:49.300
<i>The objective for today's G8 summit was
the concern of the medical community...</i>

38:49.500 --> 38:52.300
<i>...over the escalating cases
of this mysterious flu virus.</i>

38:52.400 --> 38:54.700
<i>Even more surprising
was the president's...</i>

38:54.900 --> 38:57.000
Tucker, it's me. Where are you?

38:57.200 --> 39:02.000
Call me as soon as you get this.
It's important that I speak to Oliver.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.500
Good, come in.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.400
Oh, Ben, Carol.
Thank you for coming so fast.

39:07.700 --> 39:11.300
- This is a colleague of mine, Dr. Galeano.
- Oh, doctor. Thank you.

39:11.400 --> 39:14.200
He came over, I couldn't work out
what was wrong with him.

39:14.400 --> 39:18.300
He didn't want to be near his wife.
He was worried about my husband.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.000
What did he say about Henryk?

39:20.200 --> 39:21.900
Where is your husband?

39:22.000 --> 39:24.300
I don't know.
I haven't been able to reach him.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
Oh, my God.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.300
- Jesus.
- Unbelievable.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.900
Oh, Yorish.

39:36.800 --> 39:39.000
He's so much worse. What is it?

39:40.100 --> 39:42.700
It's some kind of cellular condensation.

39:42.900 --> 39:46.400
Look at his carotid. His blood pressure
must be through the roof.

39:46.600 --> 39:49.700
Don't wake him. If he's in deep sleep,
it might hurt him.

39:49.900 --> 39:52.900
We'll need a complete diagnostic.
Record his vitals.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.600
Get blood and tissue samples.
Got any kit with you?

39:55.800 --> 39:57.000
Some.

39:57.100 --> 40:00.500
Luddie, we're gonna need a video camera.
Is there one in the press room?

40:00.700 --> 40:02.700
Carol, you've got a camera
in your phone.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.400
Get him off me!

40:11.300 --> 40:12.700
Get Yorish off her!

40:14.100 --> 40:15.500
Help her!

40:32.100 --> 40:33.500
Yorish!

40:38.400 --> 40:41.400
- I'm going to call the police.
- No, don't. Just...

40:42.500 --> 40:43.700
Don't call anyone yet.

40:43.900 --> 40:48.100
The REM-sleep interruption
must've caused his cardiac arrest.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.500
- Carol?
- I'm gonna get Oliver.

41:03.900 --> 41:05.800
- Carol.
- Check your messages, Tucker.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.100
I've been trying to get ahold of Ollie.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.500
Come in. Come in.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.300
These are colleagues of mine.

41:14.200 --> 41:15.300
Oliver!

41:15.500 --> 41:17.700
He's fine. He's with Gene.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.200
- Where you going?
- To get Ollie's things. He's coming with me.

41:25.700 --> 41:29.000
- You're very emotional right now.
- What's going on, Tucker?

41:29.200 --> 41:33.000
- Why don't you calm down?
- I just saw a man die.

41:33.200 --> 41:35.900
People are dying.
What are you really covering up, huh?

41:36.100 --> 41:40.400
What is it? You've got people lining up
like this is smallpox or something.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.800
What are you really
inoculating them for, Tucker?

41:44.800 --> 41:46.400
Tell me.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.400
Open the goddamn door!

41:54.800 --> 41:55.900
Open the door.

42:14.700 --> 42:15.900
What's going on here?

42:16.800 --> 42:19.100
When you wake up,
you'll feel exactly the same.

42:21.300 --> 42:23.500
- Oh, my God.
- You'll be the same.

42:24.800 --> 42:28.300
Every thought, memory, every habit...

42:28.500 --> 42:30.500
...will still be you.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.500
Don't fight, Carol.

42:33.400 --> 42:34.600
There's no need for it.

42:36.900 --> 42:38.800
All you have to do is nothing.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.200
That's all we're asking.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.800
It doesn't hurt.

42:50.800 --> 42:51.800
Watch.

42:55.500 --> 42:57.300
It's just like catching a cold.

42:58.600 --> 43:00.700
No! No!

43:02.200 --> 43:03.900
No!

43:05.400 --> 43:06.900
No!

43:07.700 --> 43:09.000
No!

43:20.900 --> 43:22.500
It's too late, Carol.

43:25.200 --> 43:28.100
- It's done.
- Oliver!

43:29.600 --> 43:31.600
Oliver!

44:32.100 --> 44:35.500
Help me! Help! Help me!

44:36.300 --> 44:38.900
Help! Help me!

44:39.100 --> 44:43.300
Please, help me! Please, help!
Help me!

44:54.600 --> 44:59.200
<i>Red Line service to Friendship Heights,
Adams Morgan, Dupont Circle...</i>

44:59.300 --> 45:01.700
<i>...Farragut North, boarding Track 3.</i>

45:11.500 --> 45:15.300
<i>Stand away from the doors.
Subway doors are now closing.</i>

45:24.600 --> 45:26.500
<i>Mom, I don't know where I am.</i>

45:26.700 --> 45:31.100
<i>Dad brought me here. I'm really scared.
Please come get me.</i>

45:50.800 --> 45:55.000
Try to calm down. You can fool them,
but you gotta calm down.

45:55.200 --> 45:58.500
- What?
- Don't show emotion.

45:59.900 --> 46:01.600
Then they can't tell who's who.

46:02.900 --> 46:04.800
- John.
- Stay calm.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.800
Jen, Jen, Jen.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.300
- Jen!
- Just leave us alone!

46:20.500 --> 46:22.200
What's wrong with you people?

46:22.400 --> 46:23.600
Come on, come on!

46:41.100 --> 46:43.900
Get the door open! Do it, do it!

46:49.300 --> 46:50.600
Come on!

47:01.200 --> 47:02.900
Come on! Jump!

47:04.900 --> 47:06.500
Jump!

47:06.900 --> 47:08.400
No! No!

47:08.800 --> 47:10.900
No! No!

47:37.800 --> 47:39.800
- Don't move.
- All right, miss. Slow down.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.900
Oh, God. You're one of them, aren't you?

47:43.400 --> 47:44.900
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
I have a family. I have two boys.

47:54.100 --> 47:55.400
Oh, God.

48:30.500 --> 48:35.500
Don't sleep, don't sleep, don't sleep...

48:38.100 --> 48:39.400
No!

48:39.600 --> 48:41.300
Dad, no! Dad!

48:41.500 --> 48:45.100
No! Dad! Dad! Dad!

48:54.800 --> 48:57.600
You're sweating. They don't do that.
They'll know.

48:57.700 --> 48:58.900
Now go away from here.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.800
Dad!

49:24.200 --> 49:25.900
Next in line, please.

49:26.100 --> 49:27.400
Carol.

49:27.900 --> 49:29.600
Are you here for your shot?

49:31.400 --> 49:33.000
I had mine last night.

49:34.600 --> 49:35.900
I'm glad to hear that.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.000
Have you seen Oliver?

49:38.100 --> 49:40.200
I'm afraid I haven't.

49:47.500 --> 49:49.100
Ollie?

49:50.200 --> 49:52.000
Ollie?

49:53.000 --> 49:54.700
Ollie!

49:57.800 --> 49:59.100
Oliver!

50:02.400 --> 50:03.600
Ollie!

50:47.100 --> 50:49.300
No! No!

50:51.700 --> 50:53.900
What are you doing? No!

50:54.100 --> 50:55.900
No! No!

51:13.700 --> 51:17.600
I can't find him. I can't find him, Ben.
I can't find him.

51:17.700 --> 51:20.800
I can't find him.
I've looked everywhere, and I can't...

51:21.000 --> 51:23.300
- I can't find...
- We're gonna find him.

51:26.100 --> 51:28.300
It transmits like a virus or bacterium...

51:28.400 --> 51:31.500
...through exchange of fluids,
a kiss, an injection.

51:31.700 --> 51:34.100
Fort Detrick went into
lockdown mode this afternoon.

51:34.300 --> 51:37.900
They're running simulations now.
The numbers they estimate are incredible.

51:38.300 --> 51:41.200
Tens of millions may be infected
in the U.S. alone already.

51:41.400 --> 51:43.400
How can we know
if we've got it inside us?

51:43.500 --> 51:47.000
We can't. We just have to make sure
we stay awake.

51:47.100 --> 51:49.500
The change occurs when the body
undergoes REM sleep.

51:49.700 --> 51:52.400
We'll watch each other,
make sure we don't fall asleep.

51:52.600 --> 51:56.300
Fort Detrick is 50 miles from here.
We get down there, they'll take us in.

51:56.500 --> 51:58.500
I'm not going anywhere without my son.

51:59.500 --> 52:03.200
Carol and I'll go and find Oliver.
Then we'll meet you at Fort Detrick.

52:05.100 --> 52:06.100
Look.

52:11.400 --> 52:14.100
Where did you go? I was worried.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.100
Oh, God.

52:18.700 --> 52:22.600
You've always trusted me.
We've never been apart.

52:23.900 --> 52:27.300
You have to come to me,
or we can't be together.

52:30.900 --> 52:32.300
I need you.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.500
Henyo.

52:46.300 --> 52:48.400
Are there other people in the house?

53:17.300 --> 53:19.400
Form a line.

53:19.600 --> 53:22.700
Take a seat on the buses.

53:22.900 --> 53:28.300
Stay within the barricade.
Thank you for your cooperation.

53:32.900 --> 53:35.700
We should turn around.
We should not go there.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.800
No. They'll notice.

53:37.900 --> 53:41.900
Just stay calm, keep walking,
look them straight in the eye.

53:42.100 --> 53:44.300
- Stop it! Let go!
- Stay where you are!

53:44.500 --> 53:47.600
I know what's going on!
We don't have to go with them!

53:47.800 --> 53:48.900
Get on the ground, ma'am.

53:49.100 --> 53:52.400
I've been asleep.
Don't you get it? I've already slept.

53:52.800 --> 53:54.600
That's one of my patients.

53:54.800 --> 53:56.100
Would you let go of me?

53:56.800 --> 53:59.000
Help!

54:01.700 --> 54:03.700
Let's go.

54:03.800 --> 54:05.400
Good luck.

54:08.500 --> 54:11.600
She was saying she slept.
Did you hear her?

54:11.700 --> 54:15.600
So if she slept and she were infected,
that would mean she was immune.

54:15.700 --> 54:18.600
Possibly. There might be something
in her medical records.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.500
Do you keep them in your office?

54:20.600 --> 54:21.700
Yeah.

54:21.900 --> 54:25.600
<i>215, are you still requesting backup
for a traffic stop at Hampshire and M?</i>

54:26.300 --> 54:30.100
<i>Yes, dispatcher, we've got... 215, we need
backup as soon as you can. Over.</i>

54:31.600 --> 54:34.800
<i>Copy, 215. ETA five minutes.</i>

54:42.200 --> 54:45.200
<i>All units, please be advised,
inoculations have begun.</i>

54:45.400 --> 54:49.800
<i>Scout 42, see the National Guard commander
at 56th Street to assist in crowd control.</i>

54:50.100 --> 54:51.500
<i>Copy. ETA five minutes.</i>

55:09.800 --> 55:14.100
Here's what I have. G.P. notes should be
in there. I'm gonna check the computer.

55:16.100 --> 55:18.600
I think her husband
transformed very early.

55:18.700 --> 55:22.200
- What kind of medication was she on?
- She was on BuSpar and clonazepam...

55:22.300 --> 55:24.800
...and I recently prescribed Risperdal.

55:25.200 --> 55:27.200
Oh, Jesus, how ridiculous.

55:27.400 --> 55:31.400
Her husband's infected with an alien virus,
and I prescribe an antipsychotic.

55:31.600 --> 55:35.300
Yeah, well, I thought that sample
you brought me was a Halloween gag...

55:35.600 --> 55:37.100
...so who's to know?

55:37.200 --> 55:40.400
That's interesting. She had encephalitis
when she was a child.

55:40.500 --> 55:43.900
- Yeah, it almost killed her.
- It onset as a varicella complication.

55:44.600 --> 55:48.200
- Her sister gave her the chickenpox.
- It might not be normal encephalitis.

55:48.300 --> 55:52.000
There's acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis, which is ADEM.

55:52.200 --> 55:55.900
It affects substantia alba, the brain's
white matter, as opposed to gray matter.

55:56.000 --> 55:59.800
It could be the reason why the virus
hasn't been able to attack her system.

56:00.700 --> 56:02.600
Well, we need to find her.

56:03.200 --> 56:04.900
- Are you all right?
- Three years ago...

56:05.100 --> 56:06.500
...Oliver got the chickenpox.

56:06.700 --> 56:09.100
He'd had his shots,
but it was a new strain...

56:09.200 --> 56:11.700
...and in the middle of it,
he had horrible dreams.

56:11.900 --> 56:14.700
His temperature skyrocketed,
he was hallucinating.

56:14.900 --> 56:17.300
I took him to the hospital.
They diagnosed him with...

56:17.500 --> 56:18.800
ADEM.

56:19.000 --> 56:22.000
- Do you think Ollie might be immune?
- It's a possibility.

56:22.200 --> 56:25.100
He's been at Tucker's for two nights
and he's still texting you.

56:25.300 --> 56:26.600
That could be the reason why.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.400
What if they find out that he's immune?

56:30.300 --> 56:33.200
I'm gonna call Galeano,
tell him what's going on. Okay?

56:33.400 --> 56:34.400
Oh, Ben.

56:34.600 --> 56:36.400
And then we'll go and find Oliver.

56:39.400 --> 56:41.000
<i>- Yeah?
- Hi, it's Ben.</i>

56:41.100 --> 56:43.400
<i>- Did you reach Fort Detrick?
- Yeah, we're here.</i>

56:43.500 --> 56:45.300
<i>You wouldn't believe this place, man.</i>

56:45.400 --> 56:48.200
So much Nobel gold here,
you'd think you were at Fort Knox.

56:48.300 --> 56:51.700
<i>Nadler, Stamets, Bohm, Dworetzky.</i>

56:51.800 --> 56:53.700
They're flying people in constantly.

56:53.900 --> 56:56.100
Helicopters and planes
are swarming all around.

56:56.300 --> 57:00.900
Somebody realized there's a war going on,
and the only way to win it is in a lab.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.900
<i>They know what they're doing.
They got a first-stage protocol.</i>

57:04.200 --> 57:06.400
- They've isolated it?
- They can test for it.

57:06.600 --> 57:09.600
- Do you have it?
- I'll know in about an hour.

57:10.300 --> 57:11.300
<i>Listen, Steven.</i>

57:11.500 --> 57:16.400
Remember the woman we saw by
the roadblock? She had ADEM as a child.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.300
Substantia alba. Interesting.

57:18.400 --> 57:22.000
What I'm thinking is that if she's immune,
maybe we have causality.

57:22.100 --> 57:23.300
<i>I get it. I see it.</i>

57:23.500 --> 57:25.800
The ADEM affects the neuron structure.

57:25.900 --> 57:28.600
If that were true,
we could create a conjugate vaccine.

57:28.700 --> 57:31.000
If possible,
we could reverse the process.

57:31.100 --> 57:34.300
But we need verification. We need
blood work, biopsy, MRI, PET scan.

57:34.500 --> 57:36.700
<i>- Do we know she's alive?
- We got an alternative.</i>

57:36.900 --> 57:39.500
Carol's son, Oliver. He had ADEM.

57:39.700 --> 57:43.500
- Wait. Wait, are you still downtown?
- Yeah, we're in Carol's office.

57:43.700 --> 57:46.900
- Okay, you need to get out of there now.
- Why?

57:54.900 --> 57:57.700
Okay. Yeah. Bye.

57:57.900 --> 58:00.300
- Carol.
- That was Ollie. He's in Baltimore.

58:00.400 --> 58:01.700
Baltimore?

58:01.900 --> 58:05.000
Tucker's taken him to his mother's house.
I don't know why.

58:05.100 --> 58:07.100
Well, I think I know why.

58:07.200 --> 58:09.900
That roadblock, that's the beginning.
They've set up quarantine.

58:10.100 --> 58:12.200
Stay within the barricade.

58:12.300 --> 58:14.800
They're sealing off this part of the city.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.200
- No, I have to get to Baltimore.
- Yeah, I know.

58:17.300 --> 58:18.500
I have to get to Oliver.

58:18.700 --> 58:21.900
I promised you that we're gonna find Oliver.
You gotta trust me.

58:22.100 --> 58:24.200
Stay down.

58:26.300 --> 58:28.100
We'll do what it takes
to get through this.

58:29.100 --> 58:31.800
- Hey!
- Hey!

58:35.000 --> 58:36.600
Ben.

58:38.700 --> 58:40.100
I have it.

58:42.500 --> 58:45.000
Tucker held me down and I have it.

58:59.800 --> 59:03.400
Oh, God. I'm so afraid
I'm gonna fall asleep.

59:04.300 --> 59:07.100
I'm so afraid I'm gonna lose him,
I'm gonna lose you.

59:10.100 --> 59:11.900
I'm gonna lose everything that matters.

59:12.500 --> 59:15.300
No, no, no, you won't.

59:15.500 --> 59:18.600
You can go for a week without sleep,
and then we'll find a pharmacy.

59:18.900 --> 59:21.500
We'll do whatever it takes
so you can stay awake.

59:21.700 --> 59:26.100
I just want you to know
there is nothing I wouldn't do for you.

59:28.700 --> 59:30.100
Nothing.

59:34.000 --> 59:37.800
Carol, get out! Get out. We've gotta
get out of the car now. Get out!

59:39.300 --> 59:41.100
- Ben!
- I'll find you!

59:41.300 --> 59:42.900
- No!
- Find Oliver!

59:43.700 --> 59:44.900
I love you!

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.600
I need to see your ID, ma'am.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.900
Never mind. Good evening, ma'am.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.800
Where are your parents, Gene?

01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:38.000
They didn't survive.
Your family is my family now.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.800
Enough pretending. Come. Sleep.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.300
I don't wanna go out there
with all of them watching me.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.800
I just wanna do it alone.
I'll do it, I just...

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.100
You can lock me in here.
I just wanna be alone...

Last night and this morning.

01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.100
Does that mean something bad?

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.200
Oliver...

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.300
...that means you're immune, baby.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.700
That means you're immune.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:28.000
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.000
Come on.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:43.900
<i>On the streets of Baghdad,
there was jubilation...</i>

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.300
<i>...as the last of U.S. forces withdrew...</i>

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:49.100
<i>...marking the end
of the occupation of Iraq.</i>

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:53.600
<i>Iraqi President al-Sadr was on hand
to commemorate the occasion...</i>

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.900
<i>...and praised Sunni, Shiah,
Kurd and Turkoman...</i>

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.300
Security.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.400
Yes, he's outside the building.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.100
Ma'am?

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.400
Run.

01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:36.800
Run.

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:06.500
Mom!

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:08.600
Here!

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.300
Find the door.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.100
Son?

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.000
This is your father.

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.800
Son?

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.200
Where are you?

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.200
I saw you sleeping, Oliver.

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:33.900
There is only one reason
you'd be trying to hide from me.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.500
I don't understand your resistance, Carol.

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.300
You give people pills
to make their lives better.

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:50.500
How is that so different
from what we're doing?

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.400
It's a pity.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.200
I had hoped we could be a family again.

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:08.400
Do you know why
our marriage failed, Carol?

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.100
Because I was third.

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:16.400
The thing you loved the most
was your son.

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.800
After him came your job.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.300
After that came me.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.400
I was third on your list.

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.800
That can't happen in our world.

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.500
You remember what you said to me...

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:48.500
...when you signed our divorce papers?

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.200
"Sometimes we have to do things
which are painful...

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:59.300
...to make our lives better. "

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:02.800
You were so right.

01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:05.700
Stop!

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:13.500
You shouldn't hit your father.
You were raised better than that.

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:17.500
I wish it didn't have to be like this. You
didn't wake up like you were supposed to.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.400
Are you all right? Yeah?

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:47.200
Mom, what are we doing here?

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.500
I'm just gonna look for some medicine.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:51.200
Come on.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.800
Come on.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:04.000
Mom, what kind of medicine
do you need?

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.600
Something to keep me
from going to sleep.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.200
What'll happen if you do go to sleep?

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.200
We have to make sure that I don't.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.700
Now, Ollie, I may need your help.

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.600
You...

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:27.300
You remember your cousin Zoe, don't you?
She had diabetes, remember?

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.600
Sometimes she needed a shot.

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.500
Well, if something happens
and I do fall asleep...

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:37.700
...I'm gonna need you
to be very brave for me, okay?

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.700
You can be brave, huh?

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:45.900
If I fall asleep, I'm gonna need you
to give me a shot. Just like Zoe.

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.200
But I'm gonna need you to put it...

01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.400
...here, in my heart.

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.900
You just push the needle into my heart...

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:57.700
...and you press the plunger.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.000
I know it seems scary, but...

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:03.700
Anyway, it's just in case.
I'm gonna put it here, in my pocket.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.700
- You got that?
- Okay.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:14.600
I love you, Oliver. I love you so much.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:26.600
Ben, where are you?

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.200
I'm outside Patterson Park,
about to go into a hospital.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.700
Galeano needs as much uncontaminated
blood as I can get. Where are you?

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:36.500
We're in a pharmacy. South of Jefferson.

01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:38.300
<i>- Is Oliver with you?
- Yeah.</i>

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.400
<i>- Good.
- I'm really tired.</i>

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.700
- All right, I'll be there as soon as I can.
- Hurry.

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.900
Mom, I'm kind of hungry.

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:53.400
- You want some pretzels?
- Sure.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:56.800
- How about some nuts?
- Nuts, you mean like peanuts?

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.400
- Almonds.
- Cashews.

01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:00.700
- Walnuts.
- Pecans.

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:02.500
- Macadamias.
- Pistachios.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.100
Chestnuts. Pine nuts. Hazelnuts.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.600
All right. You win.

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.100
Here. Want some?

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:16.400
So is this what they mean
by "going nuts"?

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:21.000
Yeah. Yeah, this is what they mean.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:27.200
<i>This is Dr. Ben Driscoll.
Leave a message after the tone.</i>

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.500
Shit.

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.700
Where are you?

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.300
Hey, Mom. What's in here?

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.000
No, no. No.

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:53.300
Stay here.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.500
Whatever you hear, Oliver...

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.300
...you must not open this door.
- Are there more of them in there?

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.400
Don't open it, all right?

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.800
- Is that real?
- It's just for protection...

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.500
...till we get out of here.

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.600
How much longer?

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.300
It won't be long. It can't be.

01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:14.800
I'm not going to sleep.

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:19.600
I know. Just rest.

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:23.900
Don't go anywhere.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.800
I'm right here.

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:50.600
Oh, God.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.900
Open the door, open the door!

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.900
Please open the door!

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.800
Hurry.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:46.200
Hurry, Ben. Please, hurry.

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:47.500
Hurry.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:19.600
Mom? Mom?

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.400
Mom!

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.800
Mom?

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.500
Mom!

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.400
Mom!

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.100
Mom!

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.700
Mom, wake up! Wake up, Mom!

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:39.700
Mom! Mom, wake up!

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.700
Wake up.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.500
Oliver. Oh, my God, Oliver.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.400
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.600
It's okay. It's okay.

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:12.200
- It's okay, Mom. It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.900
We gotta get out of here.

01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:45.800
Ben.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.200
Where have you been?

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.500
I was at the hospital.
There was some trouble, but I'm here now.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:54.700
Oh, God. Oh, my God,
you wouldn't believe what's happened.

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.200
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.700
I know how afraid you've been, Carol.

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:01.900
But you don't have to be
afraid ever again.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.400
Oh, no. No, no, no.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.400
- No, no, no.
- No, just... Just listen to me.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.300
No, not you.

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.700
- Dr. Ben.
- Hey, Ollie.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.000
Get away from him! You come here!

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.500
- Carol.
- Get away!

01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:22.500
- Get away from us!
- Carol, look at yourself.

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.100
Is this who you are?
Is this who you want to be?

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.300
We were wrong to fight them.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.800
No. No.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.200
- Remember our trip up to Colorado?
- Shut up.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.400
- Do you remember the aspen grove?
- Shut up. Shut up!

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.500
How beautiful and peaceful it was.

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.200
- Remember what you said to me?
- I didn't say anything to you!

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.000
You wondered what it'd be like
if people could live more like those trees...

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.000
...completely connected
with each other, in harmony.

01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:51.500
As one.

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:55.700
You're not Ben. I know you're not Ben.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.100
I'm not just Ben...

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.200
...I'm more than Ben.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.600
Stop! Don't open that door!

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:08.800
Have you seen the television?
Have you read the newspapers?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
See what's happening,
what we're offering?

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:16.100
A world without war, without poverty,
without murder, without rape.

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:17.500
A world without suffering.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:22.500
Because in our world, no one can
hurt each other or exploit each other...

01:22:22.700 --> 01:22:26.600
...or destroy each other,
because in our world, there is no other.

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.000
You know it's right, Carol.

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.100
Deep down inside,
you know that fighting us...

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.400
...is fighting for all the wrong things.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.700
Carol...

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:40.600
...you know it's true.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.600
Our world is a better world.

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:48.800
What about Ollie?

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.900
- We'll take care of him.
- How?

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.800
Tell me how!

01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.800
There is no room
for someone who is immune.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.400
Mom? Mom!

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.100
Don't touch my child!

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.700
No one touches my child!

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:09.800
- Will you kill us all?
- If I have to.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:12.100
- We have to stop you.
- You can't stop me.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:13.800
But we have to try.

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:24.500
Could you shoot me so easily?

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.400
No.

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:32.500
Run!

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:35.400
Run! Let's go!

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:39.600
Get in the car. Go!

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:56.100
That's Ben's.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.500
<i>- Hello?
- Carol, is that you?</i>

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.100
<i>- Steven?
- We're waiting for Ben. Is he with you?</i>

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.700
Oh, God, Steven.
Steven, we need your help.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.600
<i>Carol, where are you?</i>

01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.500
<i>Carol, what is happening? Carol.</i>

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.700
<i>Carol, where are you? Carol?</i>

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.600
Mom?

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.600
<i>Carol!</i>

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.200
<i>Carol!</i>

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.200
Mom!

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.500
Mom! Wake up!

01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:52.500
Mom!

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:56.200
Look! Mom!

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Look!

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.600
No!

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:04.400
Go, go!

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:20.600
Ollie, the phone. Get the phone!

01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:41.600
<i>Carol, what's going on? Carol!</i>

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.100
<i>Carol, where are you?</i>

01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:54.100
<i>I'm in a helicopter. We're over the city.</i>

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.900
He says he's in a helicopter!
Where are we?

01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:00.400
I don't know.
I think we're heading south on 13th.

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.600
South on 13th!

01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:48.300
<i>You need to get to the Carlson Building.
It has a landing pad.</i>

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.100
- We're almost there. Are you close?
- Yeah, we're a couple of blocks away.

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.200
Mom, I hear it!

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.900
There!

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.900
Carol, you're almost there.

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:07.900
<i>There's a parking garage under the building.
Couple blocks up ahead on your right.</i>

01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:13.500
- Mom!
- Get down!

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.900
Oh, no.

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:28.400
Turn right, Carol.

01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.700
Turn right! Now!

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.500
Get to the roof!

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.700
Let's go.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.100
- Ollie, you okay?
- Yeah.

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:30.700
They're coming!

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.900
Move out! Set perimeter!

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:17.400
Run! Come on, you're almost there!

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.600
- Go, go, go! Go!
- Move!

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:33.100
Clear!

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:41.400
You're okay.

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.500
<i>Scientists are reporting
that identifying the immunity gene...</i>

01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:04.400
<i>...is the first step in creating
a cure to the pandemic.</i>

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.300
<i>Survivors are using every means
to spread the vaccine...</i>

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.000
<i>...to as many people as possible.
Food and water supplies...</i>

01:30:11.100 --> 01:30:14.100
<i>Pockets of the immune began to grow
across the country...</i>

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.100
<i>...retaking control of major cities...</i>

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:18.900
<i>On the anniversary of
the space shuttle Patriot disaster...</i>

01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.800
<i>...leading scientists convened
in Washington today...</i>

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000
<i>...to update the president on the continued
efforts to eradicate the global pandemic.</i>

01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:30.500
- Dr. Galeano!
- Is this the final word?

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:33.600
- The virus, will it spread again?
- The situation's under control.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.200
Inoculation centers throughout the globe
are experiencing success...

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.000
...in curing and immunizing
their populations.

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:41.665
Why was it so easy to cure?

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:43.800
The alien virus has
no real defense system.

01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:47.200
Once we isolated the vaccine,
the result was inevitable.

01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:49.100
How many people are still infected?

01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:52.400
- We're unsure, but the number is shrinking.
- What about memory loss?

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.700
We believe that the way
the entity plugged itself into our brain...

01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:57.800
...was so different
from how we're wired...

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:01.100
...that the mind interpreted the experience
as unconsciousness.

01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:04.400
Which explains why the cured
have no recollection of recent events.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.300
- They experienced it as though asleep.
- Does this mean it's over?

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.300
- Over?
- The alien virus.

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:12.400
Has it been eradicated?

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.200
Well, pick up a newspaper.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:18.700
For better or worse, we're human again.

01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:24.400
Ollie, hurry up. You're gonna be late.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.300
- Where's Gene?
- Coming.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.200
What did I tell you about that thing?

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.700
But I almost got it. Oh, no!

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:36.300
- You can have it back after school.
- All right.

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:38.700
Have a nice day. Love you.

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:42.300
I love you too.

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:46.400
- See you later.
- See you.

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:54.200
Eighty-three more deaths in Baghdad.

01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:59.100
Is it ever gonna end?

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:05.300
<i>In the right situation, we are all capable
of the most terrible crimes.</i>

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:07.900
<i>To imagine a world
where this was not so...</i>

01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:10.700
<i>...where every crisis did not result
in new atrocities...</i>

01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:13.800
<i>...where every newspaper
is not full of war and violence...</i>

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:20.200
<i>Well, this is to imagine a world where
human beings cease to be human.</i>
