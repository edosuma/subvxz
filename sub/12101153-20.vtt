00:01.349 --> 00:03.003
<i>Reports are flooding in</i>

00:03.046 --> 00:06.049
<i>from all around the world
of people...</i>

00:06.093 --> 00:07.790
deteriorating.

00:07.833 --> 00:12.012
Authorities now believe
that two unknown Titans

00:12.055 --> 00:15.798
battling in National City
are the cause.

00:15.841 --> 00:20.411
<i>The more they battle,
the more hopeless the people
of the world become.</i>

00:20.455 --> 00:21.847
It's like we're fading away.

00:22.979 --> 00:23.762
<i>I'm sorry. I...</i>

00:26.374 --> 00:27.375
I can't.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.030
I tried to save Lex.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.033
Mother, don't...

00:33.076 --> 00:34.121
You need to save your energy.

00:35.644 --> 00:36.775
I'm dying, Lena.

00:37.776 --> 00:38.777
Don't talk like that.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.128
It's okay.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.652
I'm ready to go.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.786
But I need to tell you
something first.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.181
I need to tell you that I knew.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.967
I knew what your mother was.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.143
I knew what you are.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.971
You knew?

00:59.015 --> 01:01.800
Your father was always happy
around you.

01:02.801 --> 01:06.109
Your light, your intuition.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.024
I was afraid for you,

01:08.068 --> 01:12.898
that your powers would lead you
down a similar path
as your mother.

01:12.942 --> 01:16.076
So I put talismans
around the house

01:16.119 --> 01:18.730
to stifle what I knew
was burgeoning.

01:18.774 --> 01:21.516
And pushed you towards science.

01:21.559 --> 01:22.734
Over time, you forgot.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.215
Your light diminished,

01:26.695 --> 01:28.088
and you became a Luthor.

01:29.219 --> 01:30.916
You can hate me, Lena,

01:30.960 --> 01:33.223
but I was trying
to help the family.

01:33.963 --> 01:34.746
To help you.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.794
And what?

01:38.837 --> 01:42.276
With these dying words
of this confession.

01:42.319 --> 01:45.235
You want me to use that gift
to save your precious Lex.

01:48.325 --> 01:51.241
I want to set you free.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.376
I've been watching
while you worked.

01:55.419 --> 01:58.161
Consternating over
your book of spells.

01:58.205 --> 02:02.122
You're not owning that power
fully and you need to.

02:03.297 --> 02:05.777
Forget about Lex.

02:06.865 --> 02:10.042
Forget about what
I wanted you to do.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.741
And live your life
the way you want to live it.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.767
Kara.
Do you have a plan?

02:39.855 --> 02:42.771
I needed time to think.

02:42.814 --> 02:45.817
To process everything
that's happened.
See where I went wrong and...

02:47.819 --> 02:50.822
suddenly it hit me.

02:50.866 --> 02:54.957
My whole life as Supergirl
has been built on a premise
that is deeply flawed.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.654
What do you mean?

02:56.698 --> 03:00.658
I've been driven by this idea
that people need to be rescued.

03:00.702 --> 03:05.315
That it was my job,
my mission... to save them.

03:05.359 --> 03:10.102
I've believed it was
my calling to be...
Earth's hero.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.582
It's just so clear to me now.

03:11.626 --> 03:16.065
We don't need to be heroes.
We need to be partners.

03:16.108 --> 03:19.982
And we need to actively empower
every single person

03:20.025 --> 03:21.723
to be the hero
of their own life.

03:23.812 --> 03:28.295
- That hits home, Kara.
- And it's relevant
to this crisis.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.297
Lex and Nyxly are using
their AllStone pieces,

03:30.340 --> 03:33.125
to empower themselves
by disempowering
everybody else.

03:33.169 --> 03:35.389
So then the reverse
must be true.

03:35.432 --> 03:39.044
If we empower the people,
that will disempower
Lex and Nyxly.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.611
Given the rate people
are de-saturating,

03:40.655 --> 03:43.048
to drain the AllStones
and stop Lex and Nyxly,

03:43.092 --> 03:45.834
everyone in the world
would need to feel
empowered all at once.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.358
I'll speak directly
to the people.

03:48.402 --> 03:51.622
We just need to find
a way to get through
to every individual.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.537
Only a mass surge of emotion
would be strong enough

03:53.581 --> 03:54.756
to draw out the energy needed.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.327
I've got it.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.458
It's, uh...

04:02.329 --> 04:04.766
my Legion crown.

04:04.809 --> 04:08.770
It allows me to psychically
communicate anything
I hear and see with...

04:10.119 --> 04:11.860
as many people as necessary.

04:11.903 --> 04:15.255
You can use it to project
Supergirl's words into
everybody's mind.

04:15.298 --> 04:19.911
Yes, but unfortunately,
I cannot make them take in
what she's saying.

04:19.955 --> 04:23.088
People come
with a lifetime of baggage.

04:23.132 --> 04:26.309
It can take years for them
to believe in themselves.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.572
And for this plan to succeed,
we need to find a way

04:28.616 --> 04:30.618
around people's natural
defense mechanisms.

04:31.488 --> 04:32.446
I may have a way.

04:33.577 --> 04:34.578
Lena.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.279
She's gone.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.323
I'm so sorry.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.151
Me, too.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.463
But I'm at peace.

04:49.506 --> 04:52.466
I didn't get closure
with my mom, but I did with
Lillian and so it's a gift.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.774
I know a spell that will
melt people's defenses,

04:56.818 --> 04:59.908
and allow them to hear
Supergirl's words
with an open heart.

04:59.951 --> 05:03.128
It won't last long
but it'll be long enough.

05:03.172 --> 05:06.436
<i>The two Titans
have just crashed into
National City Terminal.</i>

05:06.480 --> 05:09.874
It seems like a good place
to contain them while
you get to work.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.312
- Mind if I tag along?
- Us, too.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.182
I'll go get my supplies.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.673
<i>Aperto corpore, apertis mentis.</i>

05:26.674 --> 05:27.631
Whenever you're ready.

05:27.675 --> 05:30.068
<i>Animo, aperto corpore...</i>

05:30.112 --> 05:32.462
At this moment,

05:32.506 --> 05:35.378
villains are tapping into
your collective life force.

05:35.422 --> 05:38.468
<i>They're trying to siphon
your truth, hope, courage,</i>

05:38.512 --> 05:39.991
Supergirl?

05:40.035 --> 05:42.646
<i>dreams, your humanity.</i>

05:42.690 --> 05:45.257
<i>They're trying to vanquish
your destiny.</i>

05:45.301 --> 05:49.392
<i>-They think that
you're helpless.
- Supergirl.</i>

05:49.436 --> 05:52.482
<i>What they don't realize
is that your power is innate.</i>

05:52.526 --> 05:55.180
<i>It's always been within you.</i>

05:55.224 --> 05:59.576
I know there are
so many factors that can cause
people to not feel their power

05:59.620 --> 06:01.361
<i>but I'm here to remind you</i>

06:01.404 --> 06:03.754
<i>that none of those things
hold a candle...</i>

06:03.798 --> 06:06.757
to the power every single
one of you possesses within.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.718
I thought I was supposed
to save everyone.

06:12.981 --> 06:15.070
But I see now,

06:15.113 --> 06:18.247
there's only one way for this

06:19.596 --> 06:22.860
By all of us working together
as a team.

06:22.904 --> 06:26.037
<i>When each of us contributes
our unique gifts to the world</i>

06:26.081 --> 06:30.477
with a full heart,
together, we will shine.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.610
<i>The power of one individual
is enough to move mountains.</i>

06:33.654 --> 06:37.222
If we can all tap into
the deepest truths of our soul,

06:37.266 --> 06:40.051
and own our magnificence,

06:40.095 --> 06:45.448
together, we <i>will</i> defeat
the powers of darkness.

06:45.492 --> 06:48.669
<i>Together... we will
be unstoppable.</i>

06:51.149 --> 06:52.020
<i>Together...</i>

06:53.238 --> 06:54.631
we will create a better world.

07:03.988 --> 07:04.772
It worked.

07:07.731 --> 07:10.430
The AllStone's strength
has dropped below 20%.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.344
That mean Lex and Nyxly's
powers dropped, too.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.624
The people have
taken their power back.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.930
Now it's time for you
to give up.

07:32.974 --> 07:36.238
- You're jumping
the gun, Kryptonian.
- He's right.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.066
In my dimension,
we call this "just warming up."

07:46.901 --> 07:49.469
Little 5th Dimensional
for my taste.

07:49.512 --> 07:52.472
I say "When in Rome,
bring the gladiators."

08:04.353 --> 08:05.615
Feel that?

08:05.659 --> 08:07.356
The balance of power
just shifted.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.911
No touching without consent.

08:45.568 --> 08:46.961
<i>I ad regum somniorum!</i>

09:15.076 --> 09:17.078
Stop trying
so hard, Supergirl.

09:17.121 --> 09:18.296
You're gonna kill yourself.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.173
Mon-El?

09:25.216 --> 09:26.566
Your big speech
made the history books.

09:39.143 --> 09:42.016
Easy-peasy, fresh...
and squeezy.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.591
- Jimmy.
- Happened to be
in the neighborhood.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.289
Take him, sis.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.297
<i>Vade retro ad regum somniorum.</i>

10:09.696 --> 10:13.482
You brought party crashers
to fight my party crashers.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.527
That is a punishable faux-pas.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.921
Not by you.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.539
Now, Brainy!

10:27.583 --> 10:29.933
This is for Legion.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.462
Now, a blast from the past.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.952
Mom?

10:48.996 --> 10:50.954
You'd think in another life
I was a Kryptonian.

10:50.998 --> 10:51.955
Only in the movies.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.656
Mitch, right on time for once.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.179
Incinerate them all.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.877
I'm done with toxic
relationships.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.750
- What?
- I'm with them now.

11:26.642 --> 11:29.601
Oh, the two
with the good hair.
This should be fun.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.864
No, all of us.

11:39.742 --> 11:40.917
You two ready to give up?

11:41.309 --> 11:42.353
Never.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.791
The Imp is right.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.010
It's always darkest
before the dawn.

11:47.054 --> 11:51.580
Or shall I say... the infinite
night of the Phantom Zone?

11:57.325 --> 11:58.979
Lex, what are you doing?

11:59.022 --> 12:00.850
A single Phantom
almost created hell on Earth.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.722
Who knows what will happen
with more?

12:02.765 --> 12:04.071
Lex, don't be insane.

12:04.114 --> 12:05.681
Close the portal now.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.032
Once the portal's open,
it can't be closed.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.078
Time for everyone to run along.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.863
Feel free to leave your pieces
of the AllStone with me.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.474
I'm not going anywhere.

12:16.518 --> 12:17.867
Neither are we.

12:17.911 --> 12:19.521
You can count us in, too.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.453
Your funeral. Endless funeral.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.411
Now.

12:43.632 --> 12:44.764
Everyone, get ready!

12:55.209 --> 12:56.210
No.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.604
Lex. No!

12:59.648 --> 13:01.563
Why aren't they attacking us?

13:01.606 --> 13:04.000
Phantoms prey on fear.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.829
And there's no greater cover
for fear than hubris.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.135
No!
No!

13:08.178 --> 13:09.571
No.

13:09.614 --> 13:10.615
No!

13:12.966 --> 13:14.489
No, no!

13:16.708 --> 13:18.145
No!

13:29.678 --> 13:30.679
Hubris.

14:23.645 --> 14:26.343
He was an amazing man
who lived by his convictions.

14:26.387 --> 14:27.823
We'll hold him
in our hearts forever.

14:29.042 --> 14:30.695
Set up an award in his honor.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.919
Hey, everybody.

14:36.963 --> 14:40.314
I just got off the phone
with the President
and Secretary Brown.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.317
They wanted to thank us
for our help with Lex
and Nyxly the other day.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.536
They were inspired
by our victory--

14:45.580 --> 14:47.538
And they want to
reconstitute the DEO.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.236
Booyah! Right?

14:50.063 --> 14:51.368
He's right.

14:51.412 --> 14:53.196
What? I'm from the future.
I'm from the future.

14:53.240 --> 14:56.199
By, uh, stopping Lex and Nyxly,

14:56.243 --> 15:00.029
we proved that "extra-normal"
doesn't have to mean
"extra-terrestrial."

15:00.073 --> 15:03.990
They're giving us carte blanche
to reimagine the DEO
however we see fit.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.949
- Are you sure that's
such a good idea?
- That's what I was thinking.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.995
The red tape,

15:09.038 --> 15:11.954
the political infighting,
and they got in the way
of a lot of important work.

15:11.998 --> 15:15.392
I agree with both of you,
but I think we should
take the offer

15:15.436 --> 15:18.961
because what we did with Lex
and Nyxly was so important.

15:19.005 --> 15:24.836
People all over the world
were inspired to empower
themselves and each other.

15:24.880 --> 15:29.189
But that wasn't an all-purpose
cure for the problems
on this planet.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.625
Good feelings
don't last forever.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.977
So we have to do
the work every day.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.632
We can't let
this recent victory
go to waste.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.026
<i>But if we do keep the fight up,</i>

15:40.069 --> 15:42.158
<i>we can accomplish
the best in all of us.</i>

15:42.202 --> 15:44.595
<i>Not as vigilantes...</i>

15:44.639 --> 15:46.293
<i>...periodisomo de</i> William Dey.

15:46.336 --> 15:47.468
<i>...but as civil servants.</i>

15:49.861 --> 15:51.080
<i>Not as superheroes...</i>

15:52.429 --> 15:53.213
but as friends.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.699
Well, there's our ride.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.788
So you are coming
to the wedding, right?

16:03.832 --> 16:06.530
Yes, of course.
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

16:06.574 --> 16:07.705
What about you?

16:07.749 --> 16:08.706
You think you're gonna make it?

16:09.359 --> 16:10.143
Uh...

16:11.013 --> 16:14.147
Unfortunately, no. Um...

16:14.190 --> 16:15.931
After Brainy merges
with the Big Brain,

16:15.975 --> 16:19.456
there's a whole lot on my plate
with the Legion

16:19.500 --> 16:22.633
- after that, so...
- I see. Yes.

16:22.677 --> 16:24.853
I actually don't think
I'll ever be back
in this lifetime.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.771
Your speech the other day...

16:32.165 --> 16:33.775
I don't know if you realize
right now but...

16:35.995 --> 16:37.561
it changed the course
of our future.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.783
Empowering everyone
to be a hero of their own life.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.352
You... you inspire us.

16:47.919 --> 16:48.833
Always.

16:55.710 --> 16:56.928
So you really can't stay?

16:59.366 --> 17:01.933
Even just for the wedding?

17:01.977 --> 17:03.805
I've already overstayed
my welcome.

17:05.589 --> 17:09.202
- The longer I remain in 2021--
- The Big Brain is at risk.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.077
You'll be in my dreams, Nia.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.738
You've always been
the girl of my dreams.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.751
I love you, Nia Nal.

17:37.578 --> 17:38.927
I love you, too.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.323
All right, Winn.
- Okay.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.281
- Mr. Manhunter.
- Sir.

17:45.325 --> 17:46.500
Miss Danvers.

17:46.543 --> 17:47.762
And Danvers.

17:59.774 --> 18:02.429
<i>Let's go to our field reporter
with some breaking news.</i>

18:02.472 --> 18:05.562
<i>Firefighters are at a loss
at what to do with a cat</i>

18:05.606 --> 18:09.871
<i>trapped in the branches
of National City's oldest tree,</i>

18:09.914 --> 18:12.917
<i>which extends higher
than firefighters
can reach right now.</i>

18:12.961 --> 18:14.223
Oh.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.051
<i>Hold on a moment.</i>

18:16.095 --> 18:19.010
<i>It appears local business
leaders have banded together,</i>

18:19.054 --> 18:21.622
<i>to create a rope
and pulley system,</i>

18:21.665 --> 18:25.147
<i>and they're getting
Howls, the British
Shorthair down right now.</i>

18:26.670 --> 18:28.237
<i>Okay, kitty,
we're coming up to get you.</i>

18:28.281 --> 18:29.325
<i>Here, kitty, kitty.</i>

18:35.288 --> 18:36.332
Hello?

18:36.376 --> 18:38.682
Do you know who I despise,
Ker-rah?

18:41.032 --> 18:42.643
I despise people.

18:42.686 --> 18:45.733
<i>-All of them. I really do.
- Ms. Grant?</i>

18:45.776 --> 18:50.520
People are not
only destructive, selfish,
they're just so stupid.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.261
Ms. Grant,
do you, uh--

18:52.305 --> 18:53.436
No, no, uh-uh, ee.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.568
I'm speaking.

18:54.611 --> 18:56.265
Yup.

18:56.309 --> 19:00.878
Do you know that 50% of the
coral reefs are gone? Dead.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.967
All because
of stupid human behavior.

19:03.011 --> 19:06.754
You want to know what's
corroding the coral,
Ker-rah? Sunscreen.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.799
Fourteen thousand tons of it.

19:09.887 --> 19:13.021
And that is such a dilemma.

19:13.064 --> 19:15.893
I had no idea there was so much
sunblock in the ocean.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.069
That's terrible.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.289
<i>I really don't have any
time to educate you
right now, Ker-rah.</i>

19:20.333 --> 19:24.163
As we speak,
there is a gorgeous sea turtle

19:24.206 --> 19:27.253
being strangled by a large
abandoned ghost net,

19:27.296 --> 19:30.299
and I have to go rescue her
with my bare hands, and--

19:30.343 --> 19:32.040
Oh!

19:32.083 --> 19:38.046
Edgardo. Edgardo. <i>
Afilla mi cuchillo.</i>

19:38.089 --> 19:39.656
<i>-Por favor.
- Si, si, senorita.</i>

19:39.700 --> 19:41.484
<i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>

19:41.528 --> 19:45.880
Edgardo. I love Edgardo.
He's my favorite divemaster.

19:45.923 --> 19:49.492
I've been trying to learn <i>
Espanol</i> for him but...

19:50.711 --> 19:53.279
sigh, it's not going very well.

19:53.322 --> 19:55.237
Where are you?

19:55.281 --> 19:58.022
<i>Nuqui, Colombia,
the Pacific Coast.
But you know, Ker-rah,</i>

19:58.066 --> 20:02.026
I cannot stand here I'm sorry,
and chitchat. I am burning up.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.028
I am wearing a wetsuit.
I need to get in the water.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.856
Ms. Grant, wait. Wait.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.684
Was there a reason
you called me?

20:07.728 --> 20:08.990
<i>Well, Ker-rah.</i>

20:09.033 --> 20:11.601
Yes. CatCo was for sale
so I bought it.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.037
You...

20:15.475 --> 20:18.608
- You bought back CatCo? <i>
- Yes, I did.</i>

20:18.652 --> 20:20.088
Everything became clear.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.570
I'm a reporter.

20:23.613 --> 20:27.008
<i>And there's no tool
more powerful for change
than the press.</i>

20:27.051 --> 20:30.229
So you and I,
we're going to sound the alarm.

20:30.272 --> 20:34.711
And, together,
we are only going
to report on what's essential.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.539
Oh, right.
I forgot to tell you.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.542
I am hiring you
as my new editor-in-chief.

20:39.586 --> 20:44.373
And the contracts are
in your inbox, and I'll
be home in two weeks.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.375
Okay. Okay, I gotta go. <i>Adios.</i>

20:46.419 --> 20:48.812
<i>-Edgardo. Edgardo, I'm ready.
- Ms. Grant, that's--</i>

20:48.856 --> 20:49.683
Hello?

20:50.684 --> 20:51.511
Hello?

21:04.654 --> 21:08.092
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
The caterer broke her arms,

21:08.136 --> 21:11.139
so we had to find a replacement
at the last minute and--

21:11.182 --> 21:13.924
The arrangements. Kara.

21:13.968 --> 21:16.840
The flowers aren't done.

21:16.884 --> 21:18.886
You realize that the wedding
is in the morning, right?

21:18.929 --> 21:20.670
Like, as in tomorrow?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.803
Yes, I will super speed.
They will get done, I promise.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.636
Okay. What's going on?

21:31.333 --> 21:34.858
Uh, well, Cat Grant called me.

21:34.902 --> 21:38.253
Um, she bought CatCo
back from Andrea.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.428
- You're kidding?
- Nope.

21:39.472 --> 21:40.647
And she offered me a job.

21:42.170 --> 21:46.087
As... editor-in-chief.

21:46.130 --> 21:51.310
Kara, that's your dream job.
I mean, I'm so excited for you.

21:51.353 --> 21:52.311
I'm not gonna take it.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.791
I'm not taking it.

21:54.835 --> 21:58.142
Wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
What? What am I missing here?

21:58.186 --> 22:05.236
Ever since we defeated
Lex and Nyxly and started
the work of empowering people,

22:05.280 --> 22:11.591
I've been amazed at how
you and all of our friends
are flourishing.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.462
You guys are living
your dreams.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.856
Somehow I feel...

22:18.206 --> 22:19.773
deflated.

22:19.816 --> 22:22.384
Accept Cat's offer.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.386
Maybe that'll give you
a sense of purpose.

22:24.430 --> 22:28.782
Alex, I quit CatCo because
my attention was split.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.175
I was never able
to really do my best

22:31.219 --> 22:33.352
because I was always
sneaking off to be Supergirl,

22:33.395 --> 22:35.745
and that hasn't changed.

22:35.789 --> 22:38.487
If anything, it's gonna
be worse because I will have
much more responsibility now.

22:38.531 --> 22:41.403
Your responsibilities
as Supergirl have changed

22:41.447 --> 22:44.319
because you're no longer
shouldering that burden

22:44.363 --> 22:46.234
of protecting the planet
on your own.

22:46.277 --> 22:49.106
Maybe there's a world
where you can do both.

22:49.150 --> 22:54.895
Doing both will always require
me to lie about who I am
and where I'm going.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.549
Who am I now?

22:56.592 --> 22:58.725
Everybody is so empowered.

23:01.031 --> 23:04.600
And I feel less powerful
than ever.

23:04.644 --> 23:08.430
Well, I wish that I could
give you all the answers,

23:08.474 --> 23:11.651
but unfortunately,
you are the only one
that can figure this out.

23:12.434 --> 23:14.393
But I, for one,

23:15.263 --> 23:16.264
I'm not worried.

23:17.221 --> 23:21.443
Because you are amazing.

23:21.487 --> 23:25.273
And every time you've come
to a crossroad you have always
chosen the right path.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.757
What would I do without you?

23:32.933 --> 23:35.631
I know,
but you are gonna
find out quick

23:35.675 --> 23:37.677
if you don't get these flower
arrangements done stat.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.287
Oh, scary!

23:56.522 --> 23:57.914
Wow, look!

24:00.787 --> 24:02.528
Did Grandpa J'onn do that?

24:02.571 --> 24:05.008
Yes, he did. Isn't it so cool?

24:10.405 --> 24:11.885
Oh!

24:11.928 --> 24:17.543
You, Alexandra,
you are a most radiant bride.

24:17.586 --> 24:18.587
Thanks, Mom.

24:20.981 --> 24:23.418
I know I made mistakes
as a mother,

24:23.462 --> 24:27.770
but you have already parented
with more wisdom
than I ever had.

24:27.814 --> 24:30.860
I am so, so proud of you.

24:33.602 --> 24:34.690
Thank you, Mom.

24:34.734 --> 24:35.952
I love you.

24:37.258 --> 24:39.782
Guys, I want hugs, too.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.958
Me, too.

24:42.002 --> 24:45.919
- Come here, of course.
So do I.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.791
- I love you.
- I love you.

24:48.835 --> 24:51.359
- You're so beautiful.
- You are. My girls.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.806
- You look radiant.
- Oh, come on.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.025
No, no, no, I'm serious.

25:07.331 --> 25:11.422
My baby sister has grown up
to be such a woman of grace.

25:11.466 --> 25:13.686
Alex and Esme
are so lucky have you.

25:15.470 --> 25:17.037
Okay, you're gonna make me cry.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.822
Dad would be so proud of you.

25:23.043 --> 25:24.610
Dad would be
so proud of you, too.

25:32.443 --> 25:33.532
Okay, all right. Come on.

25:36.709 --> 25:39.973
I got something for you.
As you know, not all
heroes wear capes.

25:41.409 --> 25:44.194
It's a signal watch,
upgraded by Alex,

25:44.238 --> 25:47.720
so we can watch
each other's backs
any time we need to.

25:47.763 --> 25:52.246
Just, small caveat,
Don't tell Mom I gave
that to you 'cause if you do,

25:52.289 --> 25:54.422
she will make us portal in
for dinner every single night,

25:54.465 --> 25:56.032
and I can't take the tacos.

26:01.734 --> 26:02.778
I love you.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.215
I love you too, kiddo.

26:15.486 --> 26:18.054
Excuse me, miss?

26:18.098 --> 26:20.100
You don't happen to have
a plus-one to this event,
do you?

26:20.883 --> 26:21.971
What are you doing here?

26:23.625 --> 26:26.106
- What about the--
- Space-time continuum?

26:26.149 --> 26:28.587
The Big Brain?
Yes, yes, these are
valid concerns.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.850
Logical concerns.

26:32.678 --> 26:33.679
Sprock logic.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.944
I love you, Nia.

26:37.987 --> 26:41.556
I love you more than
I've ever loved anything.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.038
I've devoted
my entire life to the pursuit
of protecting people,

26:45.081 --> 26:48.998
but when I returned
to the future, I realized
that the pursuit felt hollow.

26:50.696 --> 26:54.003
The most important thing to me
is devoting myself to you.

26:56.005 --> 27:01.532
But what about the future?

27:01.576 --> 27:04.710
What if us being together
does destroy the future?

27:04.753 --> 27:06.320
That's the thing
about the future.

27:07.974 --> 27:08.975
It hasn't been written yet.

29:12.620 --> 29:15.275
Wow. Just wow.

29:15.318 --> 29:19.018
I have been waiting
for this moment for...

29:19.061 --> 29:23.283
a long, long time,
ever since I met
Alex and Kelly.

29:23.326 --> 29:27.809
Now I know you're wondering
how I would know
this would happen.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.855
I can assure you,
I did not read their minds.

29:33.728 --> 29:36.905
I didn't have to.
It was obvious.

29:39.081 --> 29:42.563
I've known Alex
for quite some time.

29:43.869 --> 29:47.220
And whilst I've always
known her to be smart,

29:49.309 --> 29:52.791
and dutiful, resourceful,

29:56.316 --> 29:57.708
and a total badass,

29:59.710 --> 30:04.324
I have always thought
that there was
something... missing.

30:06.674 --> 30:10.852
Kelly is Alex's
missing puzzle piece.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.288
They complement each other.

30:13.855 --> 30:16.466
In each other's company,
they find balance.

30:18.033 --> 30:18.991
And that balance...

30:20.688 --> 30:21.863
at a foundational level...

30:24.257 --> 30:25.258
is love.

30:27.695 --> 30:30.480
And now I'd like to step back

30:30.524 --> 30:34.441
and allow Kelly and Alex
to say exactly how they feel.

30:37.618 --> 30:40.839
Alex... you have been my person

30:42.275 --> 30:46.279
and my rock
and my voice of reason.

30:48.063 --> 30:52.372
And occasionally, my beloved
agent of chaos.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.028
- Yeah!
- Over the last two years,

30:57.943 --> 31:01.511
I wish I could say
that I always knew it was you,

31:01.555 --> 31:03.557
but I didn't know
until recently.

31:04.688 --> 31:05.733
When you came home,

31:08.562 --> 31:10.869
and you found me
distraught and heartbroken,

31:12.044 --> 31:13.480
and you didn't try to fix me.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.527
You didn't try
to put me back
together again.

31:19.486 --> 31:20.748
You were just there to hold me.

31:22.141 --> 31:24.926
And that's when I knew,
beyond any doubt,

31:26.928 --> 31:29.104
that I couldn't live
another day without you.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.718
So I vow to be
that person for you.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.940
Someone who is there
for you when you need me.

31:38.984 --> 31:42.726
I vow to hold space for you,
for our love,

31:44.250 --> 31:48.080
for our family,
and for our future.

31:51.474 --> 31:58.960
I spent so long living
this inauthentic life that
I forgot who I was.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.310
It took a long time
to figure out myself,

32:01.354 --> 32:04.661
but I was never really,
truly me...

32:07.969 --> 32:08.927
until I found you.

32:10.319 --> 32:13.888
You are my truth, Kelly.

32:15.150 --> 32:18.153
And you and Esme...

32:19.894 --> 32:24.594
have created a life for me
that I not only never dreamt

32:24.638 --> 32:27.293
would be possible
three years ago.

32:29.817 --> 32:35.866
So I promise to show you
the love that you've shown me.

32:35.910 --> 32:41.133
And I promise to always, always

32:41.176 --> 32:45.441
acknowledge the abundance
in our lives and to never
take it for granted,

32:47.269 --> 32:52.187
never take you for granted,
as I'm yours, always.

32:59.890 --> 33:03.938
I now pronounce you wife
and wife.

33:27.788 --> 33:30.008
- We're married!
- Yeah.

33:34.969 --> 33:35.970
Come here.

33:37.493 --> 33:41.497
All these birdhouses
are so pretty.
Who made them?

33:41.541 --> 33:46.328
- We did! Me and Aunt Kara!
- We've been working on it
as a surprise.

33:46.372 --> 33:49.723
- It's a lovebird theme!
- Oh, thank you, my baby bird.

33:49.766 --> 33:50.550
Ohh.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.858
It's amazing
to see Alex so buoyant.

33:54.902 --> 33:58.514
God, you remember
how she used to terrify me?

33:58.558 --> 34:01.865
Her death stare while
interrogating prisoners
at the DEO.

34:01.909 --> 34:08.133
The endless foot chases,
the amounts of glass
on the floor at the DEO.

34:08.176 --> 34:12.050
You know, hopefully the new one
will be a beacon of peace,
not violence.

34:12.789 --> 34:13.790
It will be.

34:15.575 --> 34:20.580
At least, that's what, uh,
yours and M'gann's son
tells us.

34:23.409 --> 34:26.760
- Papa bear.
- My son?

34:26.803 --> 34:34.376
Uncle Jimmy, Uncle Jimmy,
I made you a special birdhouse,
just for you.

34:34.420 --> 34:37.640
I knew you were
some kind of an artist.
This is amazing, thank you.

34:37.684 --> 34:39.903
You really like it?

34:39.947 --> 34:43.472
Anyone who doesn't like
a hand-painted birdhouse,
they don't have a heart, okay?

34:44.778 --> 34:47.781
And I have a gift for you.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.916
Your grandfather
had a camera just like this.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.222
And he gave it to me.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.357
And I figured
I would continue
the tradition.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.404
I love it. And I love you.

35:02.448 --> 35:03.449
I love you, too.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.583
Now, let's show you
how to take a real picture.

35:07.627 --> 35:10.369
So I have to say,
this is the best wedding
I've ever been to.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.240
It kind of is, isn't it?

35:12.284 --> 35:15.939
It's 'cause we have friends
that love us, friends that
are like family.

35:15.983 --> 35:18.942
Which brings us to what
we wanted to discuss with you.

35:18.986 --> 35:21.119
- I know. You want
to adopt me, right?

35:21.162 --> 35:25.297
Well, it's something like that,
but, um, in reverse.

35:25.340 --> 35:29.823
We would, um,
we would really love for you
to be Esme's godmother.

35:29.866 --> 35:33.609
I was just happy being
the really cool aunt
but yes, yes, of course!

35:33.653 --> 35:35.437
- I love you.
- We love you.

35:35.481 --> 35:36.612
You guys.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.338
Oh, and Mxy sends
his regards from
the 5th Dimension.

36:06.381 --> 36:08.253
- He pops by the Legion
now and then.
- Ha!

36:08.296 --> 36:10.168
For the wedding,
actually he said that

36:10.211 --> 36:12.300
he's going to give
Alex and Kelly one free wish...

36:12.344 --> 36:14.998
- No way.
- worth $40 or less.

36:15.042 --> 36:17.262
Oh, my God.

36:17.305 --> 36:20.221
I miss you guys.
I miss the three
of us together.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.483
The O.G. Super Friends.

36:21.527 --> 36:22.702
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.704
Remember that room
in that CatCo

36:24.747 --> 36:27.141
where we used to hide
from Ms. Grant so she didn't
know what we're doing?

36:27.185 --> 36:29.491
- Yes, with the drywall.
- Yeah.

36:29.535 --> 36:31.667
I learned about the multiverse
in that room, guys.

36:31.711 --> 36:33.408
- So did we.
- I did, too. Yeah.

36:33.452 --> 36:36.411
Man, I was Cat Grant's
I.T. guy, can you believe?

36:36.455 --> 36:39.675
And then you two walk in
and suddenly change everything.

36:39.719 --> 36:42.243
There I was, fighting bad guys
and making some super suits.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.462
You make a good suit.

36:43.505 --> 36:45.464
Thank you.
What I'm saying is that...

36:45.507 --> 36:48.510
I mean, look at us.
We've come so far since then.

36:48.554 --> 36:51.121
I figured out
what I really wanted in life.

36:51.165 --> 36:52.993
Hey, guys, come on.
You're missing out.

36:54.342 --> 36:55.430
Come on.

36:55.474 --> 36:56.866
Uh-oh!

36:56.910 --> 36:59.173
Oh, yeah. This is a great song.

37:05.397 --> 37:07.442
- Ms. Grant.
- Ker-rah, hello.

37:07.486 --> 37:09.749
Are you in the hospital?
Are you in traction?

37:09.792 --> 37:12.273
- What? No.
- Well, you haven't
signed your contract

37:12.317 --> 37:15.581
so what other explanation
can there be?

37:15.624 --> 37:19.019
- Yeah, about that I'm--
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

37:19.062 --> 37:22.370
Don't tell me you're stuck.

37:22.414 --> 37:24.372
- Yes, I-- <i>
- Well, Ker-rah,</i>

37:24.416 --> 37:27.506
even environmental crusaders
take a day off.

37:27.549 --> 37:31.249
Perhaps that's why
you're having another
personal crisis.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.902
Because you never take a break.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.774
<i>No, no, it's not that. It's...</i>

37:34.817 --> 37:37.124
I don't know how to explain.

37:37.167 --> 37:40.127
Well, you're
a grown-up now, Ker-rah.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.608
Use your words.
Happy face, sad face.

37:42.651 --> 37:44.958
Get in touch
with your feelings.
Give it a whirl.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.049
I guess
I just never felt whole.

37:51.094 --> 37:54.141
I have... I have
different sides to myself.

37:54.184 --> 37:56.535
<i>Kind of like
two different people,</i>

37:56.578 --> 37:58.798
but the two parts of me just...

38:00.626 --> 38:03.237
They don't really go together.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.935
<i>Actually, I'm at
my sister's wedding right now,</i>

38:05.979 --> 38:09.199
and her life
is just blossoming.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.593
She's fully at home
with who she is,

38:11.637 --> 38:16.294
and what she stands for,
and it's amazing.
You can feel it.

38:16.337 --> 38:18.992
- I just feel--
- Bifurcated?

38:19.035 --> 38:19.775
Yes.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.082
Inauthentic?

38:22.125 --> 38:24.563
Well, yeah.

38:24.606 --> 38:29.785
You know, it reminds me
of a quote from
an old English lord.

38:29.829 --> 38:33.789
"Secrecy is the badge
of fraud."

38:33.833 --> 38:36.444
And he should know, by the way,
because he used to feed
his hunting dogs

38:36.488 --> 38:38.751
these little baby foxes
for lunch.

38:38.794 --> 38:43.669
He was a monster.
But nevertheless,
there is no mystery here.

38:43.712 --> 38:46.324
- What do you mean?
- That it doesn't take
Freud to see

38:46.367 --> 38:48.935
that you have a secret
and it's obstructing your life.

38:48.978 --> 38:52.155
And it's not serving you
anymore, so screw it.

38:52.199 --> 38:55.811
Not that simple, Ms. Grant.
You can't understand.
I don't...

38:55.855 --> 38:57.944
Oh. You're Supergirl.

38:58.727 --> 38:59.728
<i>La-di-da.</i>

39:00.903 --> 39:01.687
You...

39:03.384 --> 39:04.646
You knew?

39:04.690 --> 39:07.693
Please, those spectacles
disguised you

39:07.736 --> 39:11.479
as much as a pair
of Groucho Marx glasses,

39:11.523 --> 39:13.960
and you should have
just added the bushy eyebrows
and the moustache.

39:15.440 --> 39:18.921
<i>Well, I heard your speech here,
in Colombia.</i>

39:18.965 --> 39:22.838
Well... "Supergirl's" speech.

39:22.882 --> 39:26.276
And "Supergirl" told the people

39:26.320 --> 39:29.454
that they should become
empowered and that they should
take care of themselves.

39:29.497 --> 39:32.239
And I'm wondering
why that message
doesn't apply to <i>toi?</i>

39:33.632 --> 39:35.024
You have a good point.

39:35.068 --> 39:39.072
Oh, Ker-rah,
I always have a point.

39:39.115 --> 39:41.857
<i>Now, let's take a look
at everything</i>

39:41.901 --> 39:47.080
that Supergirl and Kara Danvers
have accomplished separately.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.996
And then let's imagine
what you could do

39:50.039 --> 39:52.825
if you became one integrated,
authentic being.

39:53.739 --> 39:56.219
I don't know if I'm ready.

39:56.263 --> 39:58.308
Ker-rah, you need
to stop making excuses,

39:58.352 --> 40:01.399
and you need to decide
what your course will be.

40:01.442 --> 40:04.271
Now, there is important work
to be done, and I hope
you'll join me.

40:04.314 --> 40:10.538
But more than that, I hope that
you will choose to become
your full self,

40:10.582 --> 40:13.280
<i>because that would really
be something to see.</i>

40:13.323 --> 40:17.632
And it would be interesting
because this is boring.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.726
Thank you, Ms. Grant.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.165
I really needed to hear that.

40:29.209 --> 40:33.648
I believe in you,
I always have.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.790
- Here we go!
- One, two, go!

40:46.835 --> 40:48.576
- Got it!
Yes!

40:48.620 --> 40:51.492
Hey!

40:51.536 --> 40:55.017
That bouquet looks good
on you, even if it did involve
a little cheating.

40:55.061 --> 40:56.889
I prefer to call it initiative.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.107
Looks like you're next, Brainy.

41:00.066 --> 41:02.460
Oh, yes. By my calculations,

41:02.503 --> 41:06.812
there's a 100% chance
Nia and I will be
getting married.

41:14.210 --> 41:16.822
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

41:16.865 --> 41:19.128
Where'd you go?
You missed all the fun.
Nia caught the bouquet.

41:21.522 --> 41:24.090
Hey, did you fly away
to rescue some people?

41:24.133 --> 41:25.918
No rest? Even on
your sister's wedding day?

41:30.531 --> 41:32.315
Hey, what's wrong?

41:34.317 --> 41:36.798
I'm supposed to be
the strongest person on earth,

41:36.842 --> 41:39.453
but I think I'm actually
the weakest.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.500
- What are you talking about?
- Ms. Grant...

41:45.372 --> 41:46.155
My glasses...

41:49.463 --> 41:52.597
I give speeches
inspiring people
to live their best lives.

41:52.640 --> 41:55.208
But she's right.
I am too afraid
to live my own.

41:55.251 --> 41:56.514
- No, that's not true, Kara.
- It is.

41:58.037 --> 41:59.908
My entire life,
I've hid behind these glasses.

42:02.171 --> 42:04.609
It's gotten in the way
of every job I've ever had,

42:04.652 --> 42:07.699
everything I've ever wanted
to do, every relationship,
every friendship.

42:09.309 --> 42:10.876
Maybe we did have
a bit of a bumpy road.

42:15.271 --> 42:18.884
I think hiding who I am
is the reason I couldn't
pass the courage Gauntlet.

42:20.886 --> 42:22.844
I created Supergirl that night

42:22.888 --> 42:27.457
because the thought
of saving my sister as myself
was too terrifying.

42:27.501 --> 42:29.329
Look, you've had
your entire life,

42:29.372 --> 42:31.287
people telling you
who you're supposed to be

42:31.331 --> 42:35.640
and that if you didn't
hide your true self then
the people would get hurt.

42:35.683 --> 42:40.035
I mean, it's tough to move
beyond those type
of core wounds.

42:40.079 --> 42:42.951
When Lillian told me
she basically programmed
the magic

42:42.995 --> 42:47.042
out of me as a child,
I felt devastated.

42:47.086 --> 42:49.697
But I was devastated
because I realized I didn't
have a chance to grow up

42:49.741 --> 42:51.569
to be the person
I was supposed to be.

42:53.353 --> 42:54.833
And I think
it's the same for you.

42:58.271 --> 43:02.797
For me, it was always
about protecting
the Luthor name.

43:02.841 --> 43:06.671
You know, I went from
trying to make that name
stand for something good

43:06.714 --> 43:10.283
to try to be
my true mother's daughter.

43:10.326 --> 43:12.851
My life was always framed
by someone else.

43:14.330 --> 43:17.072
It wasn't until Lillian
told me the truth

43:17.116 --> 43:19.074
that I realized I haven't
been living my own life.

43:21.163 --> 43:22.774
And finally, now I am.

43:25.298 --> 43:27.256
And it feels amazing.

43:27.300 --> 43:29.128
I don't even know
what that would
feel like for me.

43:30.651 --> 43:32.174
Connecting with someone
as my whole self.

43:34.612 --> 43:38.137
To not be afraid
to just be who I am.

43:38.180 --> 43:40.922
It sounds like
it could be empowering.

43:40.966 --> 43:46.188
But what if I let myself
just be who I am
and someone gets hurt?

43:46.232 --> 43:48.974
You can't always
be our savior, Kara.

43:49.017 --> 43:51.280
You shine your light
and inspire others
to shine theirs.

43:51.324 --> 43:53.108
Your words, not mine.

43:53.152 --> 43:55.154
If somebody does come,

43:55.197 --> 43:58.244
if they try to mess with this
family, then we will
take them on together.

44:00.507 --> 44:01.334
<i>El mayarah.</i>

44:05.164 --> 44:07.819
- Hey, hey. It's okay.

44:10.822 --> 44:12.040
Of all the friends
I have ever had,

44:15.087 --> 44:19.221
you have pushed me the most,
challenged me the most.

44:24.879 --> 44:29.275
You've made me
a better person.
Thank you.

44:34.106 --> 44:36.151
Kara, Lena, come on!

44:37.152 --> 44:39.024
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

44:39.067 --> 44:41.809
They're leaving.
Bye.

44:41.853 --> 44:43.506
Bye, Esme.
Bye, pumpkin

44:43.550 --> 44:46.422
Be good.
Be good.

44:46.466 --> 44:49.251
Look at that one.
Aw!

44:49.295 --> 44:50.688
Love you, guys.

44:55.431 --> 44:57.085
Bye!

45:00.262 --> 45:02.482
We're out of here.
Bye, you guys.

45:08.836 --> 45:11.883
- Bye, Esme!
- Bye! See you.

45:13.188 --> 45:13.885
All right, here we go.

45:32.904 --> 45:35.210
Okay, okay.
Don't worry.
- Wait, wait!

45:35.254 --> 45:37.735
I think I got it. I got it!

45:37.778 --> 45:39.780
<i>To Our Next Adventure.</i>

45:39.824 --> 45:43.828
No. It's <i>The Adventures
of Tintin.</i>

45:47.092 --> 45:48.963
In Kara's defense,
that was bad.

45:49.007 --> 45:52.445
Maybe I just said that
because the last six years
with all of you

45:52.488 --> 45:56.362
have been
the greatest adventure
I ever could have imagined.

45:58.581 --> 46:01.410
And I just can't wait
for the next one.

46:01.454 --> 46:05.023
Well, if you think
getting sappy on us is going
to let us go any easier on you,

46:05.066 --> 46:07.982
then you've got
another thing coming, so.

46:08.026 --> 46:11.812
- She's ruthless and drunk.
- Cheers to that, girl.

46:17.992 --> 46:18.950
Cheers!

46:19.994 --> 46:21.996
<i>Hello, National City.</i>

46:22.040 --> 46:25.260
<i>You know her as Kara Danvers.</i>

46:25.304 --> 46:28.742
<i>CatCo's ace reporter
and new editor-in-chief.</i>

46:28.786 --> 46:33.138
<i>But tonight,
it is my great honor
to introduce to you...</i>

46:34.313 --> 46:35.357
<i>Supergirl.</i>
