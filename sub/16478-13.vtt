WEBVTT

00:11.574 --> 00:13.774
Nice room, fancy.

00:13.776 --> 00:14.558
It's not bad.

00:14.559 --> 00:16.158
I stay here
whenever I'm in town, so...

00:16.161 --> 00:17.627
That's nice, baby.

00:17.629 --> 00:19.195
Now, let's get that
silly jacket off.

00:19.197 --> 00:20.396
Maybe...

00:20.398 --> 00:22.599
50 bucks says
he chickens out.

00:22.601 --> 00:24.900
No way. He just shelled out
like a month's salary.

00:24.902 --> 00:26.802
He's locked and loaded.
He's way over his head.

00:26.804 --> 00:28.270
Look how fidgety he is.

00:28.272 --> 00:30.139
It's his first time
with a working girl.

00:30.141 --> 00:31.740
You're some kind
of mind reader?

00:31.742 --> 00:34.143
We've watched a million videos
like this,

00:34.145 --> 00:36.811
giving me disturbing insight
into the male psyche.

00:36.813 --> 00:37.879
Let's get to business.

00:37.881 --> 00:40.115
Really? Whoa...

00:42.319 --> 00:44.952
No, wait!

00:46.523 --> 00:48.297
Please.
You don't have to do this.

identify yourself!

01:45.278 --> 01:47.345
Ow!

01:47.347 --> 01:48.379
Sorry. It's me.

01:48.381 --> 01:50.147
It's Sebastian.

01:50.149 --> 01:52.349
First day on the job,
I got a little excited,

01:52.351 --> 01:53.684
I couldn't sleep,
so I figured

01:53.686 --> 01:55.085
I'd just come in.

01:55.087 --> 01:56.453
At 5:00 in the morning.

01:56.455 --> 01:57.987
Thought I'd just
get a head start on things,

01:57.989 --> 02:00.357
maybe unpack my stuff.

02:02.328 --> 02:04.894
Anyway, where should
I put my stuff?

02:04.896 --> 02:08.298
I haven't gotten you a desk yet.
Still figuring out logistics.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.497
Okay. All right, that's fine.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.833
I'll just,
uh...

02:10.835 --> 02:13.369
I'll just hold
onto this for now.

02:15.005 --> 02:16.639
We'll find a place for you.

02:16.641 --> 02:18.841
Oh, totally. Yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

02:18.843 --> 02:21.277
Just, I'm so nervous,
you know?

02:21.279 --> 02:23.512
Like, “first day at school
and you don't know anyone”

02:23.514 --> 02:25.314
kind of nervous,
but that's strange, right?

02:25.316 --> 02:26.781
'Cause I,
I know everyone here.

02:26.783 --> 02:28.617
Never easy taking a new job.

02:28.619 --> 02:30.852
Especially
on an experienced team.

02:32.322 --> 02:34.422
But you're here for a reason.

02:35.492 --> 02:37.726
You'll do great. I promise.

02:37.728 --> 02:39.628
And...

02:41.431 --> 02:43.897
...I got something

02:43.899 --> 02:46.066
for you.

02:54.277 --> 02:56.209
Your service weapon.

02:56.211 --> 02:58.111
Welcome to NCIS.

02:58.113 --> 03:01.547
Forensics Agent Lund.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.349
This is...

03:03.351 --> 03:05.151
this is really happening.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.057
So's this...

03:12.059 --> 03:13.959
Four dead bodies...
Including a sailor.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.396
Yes! All right.

03:16.398 --> 03:18.697
Man, that's insensitive.
I'm sorry.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.932
Just first case as an agent,
you know?

03:20.934 --> 03:23.335
Yeah. Gonna be great.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.378
Lieutenant Annabelle Shaw.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.414
Computer specialist
out of Belle Chase.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.882
Navy sent her here to help
install a software update,

03:38.884 --> 03:42.286
along with her co-worker,
Eric Smith.

03:42.288 --> 03:44.755
DoD contractor.

03:44.757 --> 03:47.458
Killer or killers
come through that door,

03:47.460 --> 03:48.693
guns blazing.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.828
Takes out
the guard,

03:50.830 --> 03:53.262
Mr. Smith and Lt. Shaw?

03:53.264 --> 03:55.164
What exactly is this place?

03:55.166 --> 03:58.067
It's a federal data sharing...
Well, some short of data farm...

03:58.069 --> 03:59.769
I'm sorry. Do--?
Is it my turn?

03:59.771 --> 04:02.205
Just trying to figure out
the-the briefing etiquette.

04:03.308 --> 04:05.174
Go for it, my friend.

04:05.176 --> 04:06.976
All right.
It's a Federal server farm,

04:06.978 --> 04:10.846
where different agencies at DoD
and DOJ share and analyze Intel.

04:10.848 --> 04:12.848
Yeah. FBI, CIA, Navy Intel--

04:12.850 --> 04:14.783
all of them store
their files here.

04:14.785 --> 04:16.452
High-value target.

04:16.454 --> 04:18.454
Assuming data was stolen?

04:18.456 --> 04:21.156
Yeah. Over a thousand terabytes
worth, according to this log.

04:21.158 --> 04:24.960
We're talking about a massive
breach of national security.

04:24.962 --> 04:27.495
Oh! I just can't get over it.

04:27.497 --> 04:29.930
Aww. You're all grown up...

04:29.932 --> 04:31.699
Okay. All right. You know,
I'm trying to work here.

04:31.701 --> 04:32.867
Oh, right. Yes, of course.

04:32.869 --> 04:34.902
There's a fourth victim outside.

04:34.904 --> 04:37.171
Also shot twice.

04:37.173 --> 04:38.606
How many suspects we looking at?

04:38.608 --> 04:39.974
Uh, it's too soon to tell,

04:39.976 --> 04:41.676
but I'd say just one.

04:41.678 --> 04:44.244
Each victim has a double
tap to the chest.

04:44.246 --> 04:46.179
Someone was very handy
with a weapon.

04:46.181 --> 04:47.681
Handy with electronics, too.

04:47.683 --> 04:49.516
Entire security system,
including surveillance

04:49.518 --> 04:50.984
is taken offline.

04:52.621 --> 04:54.921
Oh. I'm sorry about that.

04:54.923 --> 04:56.890
Trying to work out
the timing, still.

04:56.892 --> 05:00.659
Okay. All right. So we've got
what could be one man

05:00.661 --> 05:02.795
who breaks in,

05:02.797 --> 05:05.664
undetected, kills four,

05:05.666 --> 05:07.466
steals massive amounts

05:07.468 --> 05:09.702
of sensitive government data.

05:09.704 --> 05:11.169
Probably espionage.

05:11.171 --> 05:13.773
Should talk to DoD
and DOJ, ASAP.

05:13.775 --> 05:16.808
Yeah. I'll have Sonja and
Gregorio contact them now.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.377
In the meantime,
Christopher. Let's start--

05:19.379 --> 05:20.578
excuse me--
Hmm? Yeah.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.480
pulling surveillance footage

05:22.482 --> 05:23.648
from other buildings
in the area.

05:23.650 --> 05:25.784
You got it.
Oh, I'll go with Lasalle.

05:25.786 --> 05:27.419
No, no, no. You're okay.
You stay here.

05:27.421 --> 05:30.354
Work with Loretta. Lot
of evidence to process.

05:30.356 --> 05:32.657
That's a good idea. Not just
physical evidence, either.

05:32.659 --> 05:35.626
Whoever did this must've
left a digital trace.

05:35.628 --> 05:37.694
Patton's out of town at
some I.T. conference,

05:37.696 --> 05:39.396
but we should probably
contact him.

05:39.398 --> 05:41.698
Good idea. Do it now.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.734
We need to find whoever did this

05:43.736 --> 05:46.236
before the stolen data
gets in the wrong hands.

05:52.243 --> 05:55.077
That just looks uncomfortable.

05:55.079 --> 05:57.146
Everything about it.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.883
I know we keep
it casual at NCIS,

06:00.885 --> 06:02.618
but it seems
like you're pushing it.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.253
We're workin' here.

06:04.255 --> 06:06.556
Thought you were contacting
DoD and DOJ.

06:06.558 --> 06:08.523
Well, both agencies
reported an attempted hack

06:08.525 --> 06:10.291
of the facilities
two weeks ago.

06:10.293 --> 06:13.361
That's why Lieutenant Shaw was
sent here to update software,

06:13.363 --> 06:14.896
strengthen cyber defense.

06:14.898 --> 06:16.397
Any idea who the hacker was?

06:16.399 --> 06:17.766
None. But it's our guess,

06:17.768 --> 06:19.367
it's the same person
as the killer.

06:19.369 --> 06:20.836
This is part
of what he was stole.

06:21.738 --> 06:22.804
Surveillance from FBI

06:22.806 --> 06:25.272
of a major prostitution ring.

06:25.274 --> 06:27.140
I know him.

06:27.142 --> 06:29.309
It's Councilman Long.

06:29.311 --> 06:30.544
Well, how'd you find this?

06:30.546 --> 06:31.846
We didn't.
It went viral

06:31.848 --> 06:33.113
an hour ago.

06:33.115 --> 06:34.915
A long with eight other videos

06:34.917 --> 06:35.950
of prominent New Orleanians.

06:35.952 --> 06:37.885
All a part of the stolen files.

06:37.887 --> 06:39.820
And each of our subjects
are under some form

06:39.822 --> 06:41.254
of investigation.

06:41.256 --> 06:42.522
Internet's blowing up.

06:42.524 --> 06:44.056
Videos are getting thousands
of hits.

06:44.058 --> 06:46.325
It's straight up
public humiliation.

06:46.327 --> 06:48.628
Doesn't sound
like espionage to me.

06:50.331 --> 06:52.365
Ah, hey. It's the new guy.

06:52.367 --> 06:54.266
I can say that,
'cause I've been here a week.

06:54.268 --> 06:56.302
Welcome aboard, newbie.

06:56.304 --> 06:57.570
You got something for us?

06:57.572 --> 06:59.605
I'd say. Found epidermis cells

06:59.607 --> 07:02.808
at the scene that didn't
match any of our victims.

07:02.810 --> 07:05.276
But they did match
a very likely suspect.

07:05.278 --> 07:06.277
Ethan Beck.

07:06.279 --> 07:08.079
Ethan Beck?

07:08.081 --> 07:11.149
So. All right. So you've heard
of Anonymous, right?

07:11.151 --> 07:12.484
Of course.

07:12.486 --> 07:14.019
Okay. Well, Ethan Beck
and his people

07:14.021 --> 07:16.153
are, like, ten times better.
And their mission

07:16.155 --> 07:18.623
is to expose corruption
wherever it is.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.090
So where do we find this guy?

07:20.092 --> 07:21.659
Well, that's the thing.
You don't really find him.

07:21.661 --> 07:24.829
He finds you. He's like a...
like a phantom.

07:26.298 --> 07:28.365
I'm expecting a “but”
right about now.

07:28.367 --> 07:31.335
But there was a failed hack
attempt on the facility

07:31.337 --> 07:32.602
a couple weeks back...

07:32.604 --> 07:33.803
And Patton was able
to find out

07:33.805 --> 07:35.304
where that hack came from.

07:35.306 --> 07:37.641
And I'm gonna send you
those details right now.

07:39.611 --> 07:41.978
The abandoned restaurant
on Lake Pontchartrain.

07:41.980 --> 07:44.581
Yeah. Actually, there's activity
on the I.P. address right now.

07:44.583 --> 07:45.815
Somebody's still there.

07:45.817 --> 07:47.017
Could be our killer.

07:47.019 --> 07:48.985
Gregorio, you're with me.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.464
NCIS!

08:02.466 --> 08:03.766
Hands where we can see 'em.

08:03.768 --> 08:05.167
Slow!

08:11.174 --> 08:12.574
Elvis!

08:13.910 --> 08:15.877
Dwayne Pride.

08:15.879 --> 08:18.279
Of all the gin joints
in all the towns, and look,

08:18.281 --> 08:19.541
you brought your little buddy
with you, too.

08:19.565 --> 08:20.282
Should've guessed,

08:20.283 --> 08:22.550
if we had a major hack
job, we'd run into you.

08:22.552 --> 08:24.184
I know what you're thinking.

08:24.186 --> 08:26.486
This looks really bad for me.

08:26.488 --> 08:29.056
but this time I swear
I did not do it.

08:29.058 --> 08:30.557
Right.

08:47.455 --> 08:49.522
Hands where
I can see 'em.

08:49.524 --> 08:51.758
I am having a raging bout
of déjà vu right now.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.416
Dwayne, tell her
I'm not dangerous.

08:53.417 --> 08:54.984
Last time we dealt with
you, you were armed

08:54.986 --> 08:56.151
and almost shot a woman.

08:56.153 --> 08:57.552
She's got a point, Elvis.

08:57.554 --> 08:59.554
Out of context, unfair.

08:59.556 --> 09:01.523
And that woman
sort of had it coming.

09:01.525 --> 09:03.025
Can I cuff him, please?

09:03.027 --> 09:04.193
Not yet, New York.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.494
Elvis,
this restaurant

09:05.496 --> 09:07.829
was the source of a hack attempt

09:07.831 --> 09:09.764
on a Federal server farm.

09:09.766 --> 09:13.334
A facility where four people
were killed this morning.

09:13.336 --> 09:15.469
Right. So you think it's, uh,

09:15.471 --> 09:17.372
suspicious that I'm here,

09:17.374 --> 09:19.874
considering my past
miscommunications

09:19.876 --> 09:21.742
with the law.

09:21.744 --> 09:23.177
Um, by miscommunications,
do you mean

09:23.179 --> 09:25.780
multiple felony convictions?
Then, yes.

09:25.782 --> 09:28.215
I'm not the felon
you're looking for.

09:28.217 --> 09:29.917
His name is Ethan Beck.

09:31.686 --> 09:32.886
How do you know that?

09:32.888 --> 09:34.421
'Cause I'm looking for him, too.

09:34.423 --> 09:36.924
He runs a hacktivist group
called the Collective.

09:36.926 --> 09:38.591
More like a terrorist
organization,

09:38.593 --> 09:40.660
exposing people's dirty secrets.

09:40.662 --> 09:43.329
No. The Collective was founded
to create transparency

09:43.331 --> 09:44.931
and expose corruption.

09:44.933 --> 09:46.299
Well, right now, it's exposing

09:46.301 --> 09:48.968
prominent folks' personal lives.

09:48.970 --> 09:50.803
Yeah, and that's
really pissing me off.

09:50.805 --> 09:51.703
Why do you care?

09:51.705 --> 09:54.273
Because my reputation's
at stake.

09:54.275 --> 09:56.909
Because he created
the Collective.

09:56.911 --> 09:59.345
Yeah. I created it with Ethan.

09:59.347 --> 10:00.878
He was my protégé.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.214
But he let his ego
get the best of him,

10:03.216 --> 10:04.816
and it's not
about the cause anymore.

10:04.818 --> 10:07.819
It's about Ethan proving
how powerful he is.

10:07.821 --> 10:11.823
And that's why you guys have
to let me help you find him.

10:11.825 --> 10:14.392
Talk about ego.
We can handle this, all right?

10:14.394 --> 10:17.261
Dwayne, you don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.

10:17.263 --> 10:20.097
Do you? He's hard to track.
Listen.

10:20.099 --> 10:21.798
He's taken down
Fortune 500 companies.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.034
He's brought government agencies
to their knees.

10:24.036 --> 10:25.802
And he's never
been caught.

10:25.804 --> 10:27.537
He's dangerous.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.406
Elvis, Ethan Beck
murdered four people,

10:29.408 --> 10:32.709
including a Navy Lieutenant.
We know he's dangerous.

10:32.711 --> 10:34.177
Good point.

10:34.179 --> 10:36.112
But you got to let me
help you find him.

10:36.114 --> 10:38.247
I taught him every trick
he knows.

10:38.249 --> 10:39.482
I am the one guy

10:39.484 --> 10:41.417
who could track this dude down.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.354
Please.

10:45.756 --> 10:47.991
Gregorio?
Yeah?

10:47.993 --> 10:50.326
Take Elvis back to NCIS.

10:50.328 --> 10:52.127
Set up him up with
whatever he needs.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.395
For real?

10:53.397 --> 10:54.829
Don't look so upset.

10:54.831 --> 10:56.631
I don't bite.

10:56.633 --> 10:59.067
Unless you ask real nice.

10:59.069 --> 11:00.735
Where are you going?

11:00.737 --> 11:03.205
Summoned by the mayor.

11:08.177 --> 11:09.243
Mayor Douglas Hamilton...

11:09.245 --> 11:11.645
They got my e-mails, Dwayne.

11:11.647 --> 11:14.382
Do you...?
They got my e-mails!

11:14.384 --> 11:15.816
All right?
Posted them online.

11:15.818 --> 11:17.451
Hundreds of private messages.

11:17.453 --> 11:18.552
You're not the only one.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.488
Come on, the reporters
asking Que--

11:20.490 --> 11:21.922
They're all over the place.
You've seen them, right?

11:21.924 --> 11:23.157
...intimately involved
with your press secretary.

11:23.159 --> 11:24.492
Uh, I have nothing to say...

11:24.494 --> 11:25.492
I've got nobody, though,

11:25.494 --> 11:26.493
to field questions for me,

11:26.495 --> 11:27.660
because my press secretary's

11:27.662 --> 11:28.861
husband made her resign.

11:28.863 --> 11:31.064
I've got multiple
homicides to solve,

11:31.066 --> 11:32.632
can we cut to the chase?

11:33.968 --> 11:35.268
You're enjoying this,
ain't ya?

11:35.270 --> 11:36.769
I can see.

11:36.771 --> 11:38.438
You're enjoying this,
just a little bit.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.373
Your point, Mr. Mayor?

11:42.376 --> 11:44.443
Now, I know you think
that I'm a bad guy.

11:44.445 --> 11:46.778
Right? That, uh...

11:46.780 --> 11:48.813
I'm only interested in myself.

11:48.815 --> 11:51.150
If history is any guide.

11:51.152 --> 11:55.454
I'm screwed, Dwayne.
Oh, yeah. I'm done.

11:55.456 --> 11:58.090
And there's nothing I
can do about that now,

11:58.092 --> 12:00.658
but innocent people
are getting hurt.

12:00.660 --> 12:02.326
Private lives
are getting exposed.

12:02.328 --> 12:05.163
And this could be very bad
for a lot of good people.

12:05.165 --> 12:08.166
We agree on that
much, don't we?

12:09.001 --> 12:11.069
I can be useful to you.

12:11.071 --> 12:13.304
I can pull strings.

12:13.306 --> 12:16.406
I could give you access
to resources if you need them.

12:16.408 --> 12:21.044
Whatever you need.
Just say the word.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.514
Let's fix this together.

12:25.484 --> 12:28.418
Might be something you can do.

12:33.091 --> 12:35.157
Uh... you...

12:35.159 --> 12:36.625
you're, uh...

12:36.627 --> 12:38.394
I mean...

12:38.396 --> 12:39.928
Are you having a stroke, kid?

12:39.930 --> 12:42.098
Seriously, do I have
to give you mouth to mouth?

12:42.100 --> 12:43.499
I'm Elvis.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.033
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I know exactly who you are.

12:45.035 --> 12:46.835
You're-you're a personal hero.

12:46.837 --> 12:48.204
I hope that
doesn't sound strange.

12:48.206 --> 12:50.305
No, no, that's not
creepy at all.

12:50.307 --> 12:51.872
It's just, your work
is pretty much the reason

12:51.874 --> 12:53.941
I got into computers
in the first place.

12:53.943 --> 12:56.744
Okay, now I feel old,
but also a bit flattered.

12:56.746 --> 12:57.912
Thank you.

12:57.914 --> 12:59.147
What are you doing here?

12:59.149 --> 13:01.716
I'm trying to track
down Ethan Beck.

13:01.718 --> 13:03.451
Sorry, I didn't know
this is your office,

13:03.453 --> 13:04.852
but you got a
killer setup here.

13:04.854 --> 13:06.621
Oh, yeah, it is killer,
but it's not mine.

13:06.623 --> 13:08.021
I don't really have
an office, per Se.

13:08.023 --> 13:09.223
I-I'm kind of new.
Okay.

13:09.225 --> 13:10.790
Actually, I'm very new.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.593
Although,
I've also been around a lot,

13:12.595 --> 13:14.128
so, it's all
very complicated.

13:14.130 --> 13:17.097
Anyway, I'm-I'm supposed
to find Ethan Beck, too.

13:17.099 --> 13:18.465
Okay, good.
Cop a squat.

13:18.467 --> 13:19.500
Let's get at it.

13:19.502 --> 13:21.368
All right.

13:21.370 --> 13:23.537
Um, uh, over there's good.

13:23.539 --> 13:25.070
That's probably good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:28.143 --> 13:31.577
Now, Ethan is a hard guy
to track down, you know?

13:31.579 --> 13:36.516
Not easy to trace, but, uh,
we got a work-around here.

13:36.518 --> 13:39.418
We got all the Internet
traffic for the entire city.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.316
Whoa, how did you--?

13:40.340 --> 13:42.275
Not me,
your mayor.

13:42.523 --> 13:44.989
He took a break from bedding
his employees to help us out.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.691
Thanks to your boss.

13:46.693 --> 13:50.094
So... so, if Ethan's sifting
through all these stolen files,

13:50.096 --> 13:52.397
and he's posting them online,
then he's gonna need

13:52.399 --> 13:54.366
a high concentration
of bandwidth, right?

13:54.368 --> 13:55.900
Right, and Ethan
doesn't do the grunt work,

13:55.902 --> 13:58.502
so one of his minions
does it for him.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.271
So, if we trace
the low-hanging fruit...

14:00.273 --> 14:01.505
We can trade up to the big dog.

14:01.507 --> 14:02.100
That's right.

14:02.124 --> 14:04.376
All right. Yeah!
This is fun.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.842
Yeah, yeah,
eyes front. Yeah.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.344
Okay.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.779
I've got some heavy traffic

14:08.781 --> 14:10.481
coming from a coffee shop
in The Quarter.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.716
Good job, kid.
Call in the cavalry.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.685
Actually, I am the cavalry.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.852
Actually, I need you to help me
find the other Collectives.

14:16.854 --> 14:17.839
Oh, okay, yeah.

14:17.863 --> 14:19.290
- Let's do it.
- Yeah. Right.

14:19.291 --> 14:21.291
By here, I mean of course...
Back over there. Sure.

14:21.293 --> 14:22.292
I'm gonna call Lasalle.

14:22.294 --> 14:23.660
Pretty much always over there.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.028
Oh, this is great.

14:26.030 --> 14:29.999
Like Batman and Robin,
except a cooler Robin.

14:31.269 --> 14:33.134
Coffee shop's up here
on the corner.

14:33.136 --> 14:34.570
It's official.

14:34.572 --> 14:37.339
Mayor Hamilton's sex tape
just went wide.

14:37.341 --> 14:38.907
They got him with
his press secretary.

14:38.909 --> 14:40.442
No. Someone else.
A friend's wife.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.744
I feel bad.
For Hamilton?

14:42.746 --> 14:45.447
For him, the woman, anybody
who has their privacy invaded.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.258
I mean, we all
have secrets, no?

14:47.259 --> 14:48.260
Not everyone.

14:48.261 --> 14:49.084
Agreed.

14:49.086 --> 14:50.685
Okay, you got
a couple of saints here.

14:50.687 --> 14:52.886
Well, you live a decent life,
you got nothing to hide.

14:56.192 --> 14:58.192
Check out Mr. Robot.

14:58.194 --> 14:59.560
Yeah, Mohawk, piercings,

14:59.562 --> 15:00.661
could be our guy.

15:04.234 --> 15:05.399
Excuse me.

15:05.401 --> 15:06.999
Federal agents.

15:07.001 --> 15:08.101
Need to ask you
a few questions.

15:08.103 --> 15:10.036
We got a rabbit.

15:19.715 --> 15:21.448
Easy now.
Get off me.

15:25.085 --> 15:26.752
Attica! Attica!

15:26.754 --> 15:28.854
I'm gonna let you ladies
handle this one.

15:33.327 --> 15:35.794
Thank you, Roy.

15:35.796 --> 15:37.596
You're in a lot of trouble,
Aviva.

15:37.598 --> 15:39.131
Assaulting a Federal agent.

15:39.133 --> 15:41.299
Your guy manhandled me.

15:41.301 --> 15:43.868
You got bigger problems.

15:45.272 --> 15:47.938
We know that you're connected

15:47.940 --> 15:50.775
to a major security breach
at a Federal facility.

15:50.777 --> 15:53.344
That you've released
sensitive data to the public.

15:53.346 --> 15:54.879
You're a member
of the Collective,

15:54.881 --> 15:57.047
and you work for Ethan Beck.

15:57.049 --> 15:59.048
Prove it.

15:59.885 --> 16:01.385
Everything we need to know

16:01.387 --> 16:03.119
is right here in your computer.

16:03.121 --> 16:05.188
Boot it up.

16:05.190 --> 16:06.856
Try and access the hard drive.

16:06.858 --> 16:08.224
See what happens.

16:08.226 --> 16:09.959
Booby trapped, huh?

16:09.961 --> 16:11.395
Wow.

16:11.397 --> 16:12.829
Smart.

16:12.831 --> 16:14.697
At a level you can't even

16:14.699 --> 16:16.165
begin to contemplate.

16:16.167 --> 16:18.934
The Collective
isn't afraid of laws

16:18.936 --> 16:22.805
or consequences or cops.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.707
That's fair enough.

16:24.709 --> 16:30.413
But... I'm not the one you
need to worry about right now.

16:38.888 --> 16:40.288
Do you know who I am?

16:41.157 --> 16:43.124
I'm Elvis Bertrand.

16:43.126 --> 16:44.626
No way.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.329
And your worst nightmare
is coming true in real time,

16:47.331 --> 16:50.096
because I don't care
about laws or rules

16:50.098 --> 16:52.499
or pathetic booby traps
on your hard drive.

16:52.501 --> 16:54.435
You are gonna cooperate with us,

16:54.437 --> 16:56.737
or I'm gonna expose
every move you've made

16:56.739 --> 16:58.104
as a so-called hacktivist

16:58.106 --> 17:00.106
to the whole world.

17:06.614 --> 17:07.946
What do you want?

17:09.483 --> 17:11.016
Want you to contact Ethan Beck.

17:13.988 --> 17:17.156
Just reach out to him,
and I will do the rest.

17:26.599 --> 17:29.300
Okay.

17:29.302 --> 17:30.869
I hope you know
what you're doing,

17:30.871 --> 17:33.037
'cause he doesn't
like to be found.

17:33.039 --> 17:34.840
Now, I'm just running

17:34.842 --> 17:38.276
a little, elegant,
backtrace program I devised,

17:38.278 --> 17:42.546
and it will attack his computer
before he knows what hit him.

17:44.384 --> 17:46.484
Ooh.

17:47.820 --> 17:49.019
That's not good.

17:50.155 --> 17:51.522
Elvis.

17:53.793 --> 17:55.793
Any idea what's going on?

17:55.795 --> 17:56.760
I did not do it. I swear.

17:56.762 --> 17:58.762
You didn't do this.
Ethan did.

18:04.436 --> 18:06.269
I heard you were looking for me.

18:07.972 --> 18:09.806
Can you trace his location?

18:09.808 --> 18:11.374
I'll try, but he's got
control of our whole network.

18:11.376 --> 18:12.809
You've uncovered
the hornet's nest

18:12.811 --> 18:14.843
and woken a sleeping giant.

18:14.845 --> 18:16.512
Okay, I'm gonna ignore
your agregious overuse

18:16.514 --> 18:18.079
of mixed metaphors, Ethan,

18:18.081 --> 18:20.783
and ask you, “What the hell
is your problem, buddy?!”

18:20.785 --> 18:23.819
Elvis, you're a traitor
to the cause.

18:23.821 --> 18:25.287
I refuse to speak to you.

18:25.289 --> 18:28.857
What cause justifies
the murder of four people?

18:28.859 --> 18:30.858
I won't listen to your lies.

18:30.860 --> 18:33.360
You have no idea
what you're talking about

18:33.362 --> 18:35.129
or who you're messing with.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.266
Sebastian!
How is he doing that?

18:39.268 --> 18:40.902
I don't know,
but it's kind of cool.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.106
Okay, Ethan, Ethan,
listen to me, buddy.

18:46.108 --> 18:47.607
This isn't you.

18:47.609 --> 18:49.175
I need you to come in here.

18:49.177 --> 18:50.844
Stop looking for me.

18:50.846 --> 18:52.846
Sorry, we can't
oblige you of that.

18:52.848 --> 18:55.148
Then you'll all pay for it.

19:03.358 --> 19:07.192
Okay, well...

19:07.194 --> 19:09.127
that could've gone better.

19:24.636 --> 19:27.804
This whole Wizard of Oz
act doesn't exactly mesh

19:27.806 --> 19:30.440
with a suspect willing to kill
four people in cold blood.

19:30.442 --> 19:32.876
Well, contradiction we can try
to explain after we find him.

19:32.878 --> 19:36.512
Please, tell me you have another
way of tracing Ethan Beck?

19:36.514 --> 19:37.679
Not off the top of my head.

19:37.681 --> 19:39.415
He's gone deep underground,

19:39.417 --> 19:41.150
probably unplugging
completely.

19:41.152 --> 19:42.985
So we don't trace
him digitally.

19:42.987 --> 19:44.753
Never gonna outsmart
him online, anyway.

19:44.755 --> 19:46.588
Ooh, that hurts my feelings.

19:46.590 --> 19:48.824
Focus on who he is
in the real world instead.

19:48.826 --> 19:51.426
You're talking
about pattern of life?

19:51.428 --> 19:53.761
Um, what is this
“pattern of life”?

19:53.763 --> 19:55.230
Profiling technique.

19:55.232 --> 19:57.465
We gather every detail
we know about a suspect.

19:57.467 --> 19:58.699
What he eats,
what he wears,

19:58.701 --> 20:00.068
kind of music he likes.

20:00.070 --> 20:01.102
Especially irregularities.

20:01.104 --> 20:02.370
Any unusual traits or habits.

20:02.372 --> 20:03.905
Okay, where to start?

20:03.907 --> 20:05.907
Well, you got a guy that sits

20:05.909 --> 20:08.342
alone at home in front
of a computer screen.

20:08.344 --> 20:10.377
Weirdness comes
with the territory.

20:10.379 --> 20:12.346
We put it all
into an analytical program,

20:12.348 --> 20:14.148
and then we got a good shot
at finding him.

20:14.150 --> 20:15.682
And you actually think
that'll work?

20:15.684 --> 20:19.019
We tracked your sorry ass
not too long ago.

20:19.021 --> 20:22.423
You know, I think if you gave
me a shot, we could become pals.

20:22.425 --> 20:24.191
Really?
Yeah.

20:24.193 --> 20:26.159
We're about
to find out.

20:26.161 --> 20:27.893
Elvis, sit with Gregorio.

20:27.895 --> 20:31.630
Tell her everything she
needs to know about Ethan.

20:31.632 --> 20:33.899
Okay. Got the power going.

20:33.901 --> 20:35.634
The Internet's booting back up,

20:35.636 --> 20:36.936
so all in all,
we're in business.

20:36.938 --> 20:38.604
Good work, Sebastian.

20:38.606 --> 20:39.839
Loretta's got something,
so, Sebastian,

20:39.841 --> 20:41.274
you're with me.
Let's go.

20:41.276 --> 20:43.842
Sorry, excuse me.

20:43.844 --> 20:45.410
I'm gonna be honest.
I'm a little afraid of you.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.678
Just a little?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.646
You got to learn
to take a compliment.

20:49.816 --> 20:52.417
Wait, what are all
these e-mails?

20:52.419 --> 20:53.452
Some kind of glitch
or something?

20:53.454 --> 20:54.652
Those aren't your e-mails.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.521
That Ethan sure works fast.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.589
Works fast at what?

20:57.591 --> 21:01.125
At-at creating chaos.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.760
Yo, the Internet's back up.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.062
I know.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.331
I just got a crazy
amount of e-mails.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.600
Yeah, me, too,
and it's not good.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.470
These are ATF files
from your undercover days.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.406
Whoa. Are you kidding me?
How'd that happen?

21:15.408 --> 21:17.240
Well, I'm assuming
it's Ethan Beck

21:17.242 --> 21:19.575
making good on his threat.

21:19.577 --> 21:21.478
Well, you need
to get rid of those.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.079
Yeah, I'm all over it.

21:23.081 --> 21:24.381
Hey, and you might
want to do the same

21:24.383 --> 21:25.681
with whatever's
in your inbox.

21:25.683 --> 21:27.517
Yeah.

21:34.858 --> 21:37.126
Yeah, I probably should have.

21:37.128 --> 21:38.494
Oh, boy.

21:38.496 --> 21:39.495
What'd you get?

21:39.497 --> 21:40.896
Just an e-mail from you to Pride

21:40.898 --> 21:43.432
saying that you don't think
I should be added to the team.

21:43.434 --> 21:45.501
Your undercover identity
was just exposed

21:45.503 --> 21:46.968
and you're pissed
about an e-mail

21:46.970 --> 21:48.237
taken completely out of context?

21:48.239 --> 21:50.638
Oh, by all means,
give me the context.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.073
Well, I didn't know you yet,
and couldn't tell

21:52.075 --> 21:53.908
how you would mix
with the team dynamic.

21:53.910 --> 21:56.344
I took a bullet for the team.
How's that for dynamic?

21:56.346 --> 21:58.879
And you proved yourself
a hundred times since, to me.

21:58.881 --> 22:01.382
And me to you, right?

22:01.384 --> 22:02.983
We should probably
stop reading these

22:02.985 --> 22:04.652
before someone else gets hurt.

22:14.496 --> 22:16.796
Well, since Sebastian's busy
waging cyber-warfare,

22:16.798 --> 22:18.731
I had another tech
analyze the bullets

22:18.733 --> 22:20.600
from Lieutenant Shaw's murder.

22:20.602 --> 22:22.135
Well, those slugs
were in fragments.

22:22.137 --> 22:23.903
You were able to get
a ballistics match?

22:23.905 --> 22:26.238
No, something
far more intriguing:

22:26.240 --> 22:28.941
traces of ink.

22:28.943 --> 22:30.476
Ink? What kind of ink?

22:30.478 --> 22:31.677
Printer, pen? I mean, there's

22:31.679 --> 22:33.179
literally hundreds
of classifications.

22:33.181 --> 22:35.514
I don't know, Sebastian,
but the sample was so small,

22:35.516 --> 22:37.416
I wouldn't want anyone
to touch it, except you.

22:37.418 --> 22:38.750
That's a good call.

22:38.752 --> 22:41.019
Capillary electrophoresis
is not for the faint of heart.

22:43.056 --> 22:45.690
This Ethan Beck is proving to be
as elusive as he is dangerous.

22:45.692 --> 22:47.592
He threw us all
for a loop.

22:47.594 --> 22:50.328
And I've never seen Elvis
afraid of anyone.

22:50.330 --> 22:53.231
Worried Beck will come back,
guns blazing.

22:53.233 --> 22:54.999
It's not just guns
I'm afraid of here.

22:55.001 --> 22:56.434
A scandal then?

22:56.436 --> 22:57.668
Like with
Mayor Hamilton?

22:57.670 --> 23:00.036
Well, not just him.

23:00.038 --> 23:01.271
A lot of New Orleanians
are reeling today

23:01.273 --> 23:02.706
because of Ethan Beck.

23:02.708 --> 23:04.975
I'm gonna go, uh,
process this in my lab.

23:04.977 --> 23:06.776
No need to wait, which
should come as a relief to you,

23:06.778 --> 23:08.011
since you won't have to
worry about

23:08.013 --> 23:10.080
my inability in the field
for a while.

23:12.351 --> 23:14.451
Okay, what was that about?

23:14.453 --> 23:15.784
Not a clue.

23:20.125 --> 23:22.558
Rains, it pours.

23:24.762 --> 23:26.895
Mayor Hamilton is
once again in hot water.

23:26.897 --> 23:28.531
A sex tape featuring the mayor

23:28.533 --> 23:31.400
and an unidentified woman has
been released online...

23:31.402 --> 23:33.468
They got videos, Dwayne.

23:33.470 --> 23:35.903
Of me

23:35.905 --> 23:38.607
with different women.

23:38.609 --> 23:39.907
More staffers?

23:41.278 --> 23:43.178
Well, that's not the
point now, is it?

23:43.180 --> 23:45.147
Why the hell
is there video?

23:45.149 --> 23:46.314
Couldn't say.

23:46.316 --> 23:48.316
Couldn't or won't?

23:48.318 --> 23:51.718
My e-mails are on a Federal
law enforcement database.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.320
Okay.

23:53.322 --> 23:55.022
This day and age,
that happens.

23:55.024 --> 23:56.157
We live with it.

23:56.159 --> 23:58.626
But the video--

23:58.628 --> 24:00.494
well, that means that I'm...

24:00.496 --> 24:02.829
actively under
investigation, right?

24:04.267 --> 24:06.599
I'm not investigating you,
if that's your question.

24:06.601 --> 24:09.835
Not... currently, at least.

24:09.837 --> 24:12.772
Well, you've thrown
a lot of accusations my way.

24:12.774 --> 24:17.009
You know, the Javier Garcia
case, most recently.

24:17.011 --> 24:20.713
Garcia was murdered.
You know that.

24:20.715 --> 24:22.982
But,

24:22.984 --> 24:25.184
if there's something specific

24:25.186 --> 24:26.885
you want to confess,
I'm all ears.

24:28.522 --> 24:30.189
Well, Dwayne,

24:31.024 --> 24:34.593
if this day
has proven anything,

24:34.595 --> 24:37.962
it's that everybody
has a secret, even you.

24:37.964 --> 24:42.132
And if someone were motivated
to look hard enough,

24:42.134 --> 24:44.134
who knows what they would find?

24:49.542 --> 24:51.475
Here we go.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.520
<i>Look,</i>
<i>you've seen what you've seen.</i>

24:58.521 --> 24:59.370
You can't take it back.

24:59.371 --> 25:00.537
That's your response?

25:00.539 --> 25:03.307
You told Isler we were a pair
of cartel imbeds.

25:03.309 --> 25:04.608
I said it was possible!

25:04.610 --> 25:06.510
And that we were
sleeping together? Ew!

25:06.512 --> 25:09.112
Look, you got a vibe, that's
all I'm saying. Honestly?

25:09.114 --> 25:11.381
It's kind of obvious.
Have you watched yourselves?

25:11.383 --> 25:12.482
No, but you have.

25:12.484 --> 25:14.550
Been surveilling us
for weeks, taking photos.

25:14.552 --> 25:15.984
That's why the FBI
brought me here,

25:15.986 --> 25:17.320
to investigate you.
You know that!

25:17.322 --> 25:18.621
Yeah, but that's
our personal lives.

25:18.623 --> 25:20.723
Do you know what
surveillance entails?

25:20.725 --> 25:22.225
And I cleared you
both anyways, so...

25:22.227 --> 25:23.726
Oh, I feel so much better.

25:23.728 --> 25:25.961
Good! 'Cause now we can
talk about what I got.

25:25.963 --> 25:26.762
What about what we...?

25:26.764 --> 25:28.364
Enough!

25:28.366 --> 25:30.199
You understand

25:30.201 --> 25:31.899
this is exactly
what Ethan Beck wants.

25:31.901 --> 25:33.568
Throw us off our game,
confuse us.

25:33.570 --> 25:35.870
So he can get away.
You gonna let that happen?

25:35.872 --> 25:37.205
It's called Shadenfreude.

25:37.207 --> 25:38.640
I'll say.

25:38.642 --> 25:40.074
It's an algorithm
I created years ago

25:40.076 --> 25:41.443
to go after mouthy CEOs.

25:41.445 --> 25:43.911
It culls e-mails,

25:43.913 --> 25:45.980
looking for sensitive
information about coworkers.

25:45.982 --> 25:48.315
And I created it to
expose corruption.

25:48.317 --> 25:50.016
But Ethan has used it
on you guys.

25:50.018 --> 25:52.119
Any progress locating him?

25:52.121 --> 25:54.154
We aggregated every detail
we can find

25:54.156 --> 25:56.990
on Ethan Beck's personal habits
and idisyncrasies.

25:56.992 --> 25:58.992
There's a lot.
He's afraid of heights,

25:58.994 --> 26:00.361
so he's not living
in a high-rise.

26:00.363 --> 26:02.329
He's also a recovering
heroin addict,

26:02.331 --> 26:03.930
a big believer
in the twelve steps.

26:03.932 --> 26:05.265
Okay, so he needs
to be near meetings.

26:05.267 --> 26:06.832
And then
you add to that,

26:06.834 --> 26:08.368
the paranoia that goes
with the territory,

26:08.370 --> 26:10.202
going after the
very powerful.

26:10.204 --> 26:11.404
He likes mobility,

26:11.406 --> 26:13.406
has to be able to escape
at a moment's notice.

26:13.408 --> 26:14.707
Okay, well around here,

26:14.709 --> 26:16.576
water's the fastest
way out, so, a boat.

26:16.578 --> 26:19.545
Okay, how do we narrow it
further?

26:21.149 --> 26:23.114
Pizza.

26:23.116 --> 26:25.717
Ethan is obsessed
with wood oven pizza.

26:25.719 --> 26:29.354
And he has to have it delivered
at all hours.

26:29.356 --> 26:31.356
We got a hit.

26:31.358 --> 26:32.357
Shell Beach Marina.

26:32.359 --> 26:33.458
Gregorio, with me.

26:33.460 --> 26:35.093
Let's move.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.035
High-speed Internet satellite.

26:45.037 --> 26:48.005
This is the place.

26:57.949 --> 27:01.017
NCIS, hands where I can
see 'em, right now.

27:09.795 --> 27:10.927
Syringe.

27:23.140 --> 27:25.774
Pride, you need to see this!

27:28.813 --> 27:30.545
Suicide note.

27:31.614 --> 27:32.880
This guy's in the
middle of a crusade,

27:32.882 --> 27:34.449
exposing people
left and right

27:34.451 --> 27:35.683
and just offs himself?

27:35.685 --> 27:37.284
Does that seem right to you?

27:38.187 --> 27:41.556
Nothing about this seems right.

28:01.703 --> 28:03.951
Ethan Beck had
a hundred milligrams

28:03.952 --> 28:06.385
of nearly pure heroin
in his bloodstream.

28:06.387 --> 28:08.989
No one would have been able
to inject that much.

28:08.991 --> 28:11.858
He would have passed out
before completing the dose.

28:11.860 --> 28:13.359
This man was murdered.

28:13.361 --> 28:15.929
Yet someone wants us to think
he committed suicide.

28:15.931 --> 28:18.164
You think he had an accomplice?

28:18.166 --> 28:20.633
Beck may have released
confidential files

28:20.635 --> 28:22.234
and videos on
the Internet,

28:22.236 --> 28:23.702
thrown my team
into disarray

28:23.704 --> 28:24.937
by hacking our e-mails,

28:24.939 --> 28:27.640
but breaching a
federal facility?

28:27.642 --> 28:29.574
And expertly killing
four people?

28:29.576 --> 28:33.012
Yeah, Mr. Beck was not
in the pink of health.

28:33.014 --> 28:35.580
He would have gotten winded
answering the front door,

28:35.582 --> 28:37.081
let alone storming
the gates.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.549
Well then, what?

28:38.551 --> 28:41.986
Someone planted Ethan's DNA
at our crime scene?

28:41.988 --> 28:43.888
Set him up to
take the fall?

28:43.890 --> 28:45.356
Why go to all that trouble?

28:45.358 --> 28:48.626
Elvis and the rest of the team

28:48.628 --> 28:50.895
are searching through
Ethan's computer right now

28:50.897 --> 28:52.630
for the answer,

28:52.632 --> 28:55.632
provided they aren't at
each other's throats again.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.734
Mm.
Still dissention in the ranks?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.502
Honestly, I'm surprised
how little it took

28:59.504 --> 29:00.937
to throw us off our game.

29:00.939 --> 29:02.372
No one's off their game, Dwayne.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.340
We're family, families bicker.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.512
Oh, Pride,
I didn't realize you were here.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.547
I was about to call you
with some information.

29:11.549 --> 29:13.248
Well, here I am.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.017
What do you got?

29:15.019 --> 29:17.820
Well, I analyzed the ink
found on the bullet

29:17.822 --> 29:19.321
from Lieutenant Shaw's body.

29:19.323 --> 29:20.923
Turns out,

29:20.925 --> 29:22.257
it's tattoo ink.

29:22.259 --> 29:24.393
Special proprietary blend
called “Chimera”"

29:24.395 --> 29:26.128
Sold in limited supply
and only used

29:26.130 --> 29:27.929
by one shop in the area.

29:27.931 --> 29:29.831
Guessing you're gonna take one
of your more experienced agents

29:29.833 --> 29:31.432
to go check it out.

29:33.436 --> 29:35.103
And I'm guessing

29:35.105 --> 29:36.871
your behavior right now

29:36.873 --> 29:41.342
is about something
I said in an e-mail.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.111
Out with it!

29:43.113 --> 29:47.314
You told the director of NCIS
that I was inexperienced

29:47.316 --> 29:49.549
and that you're unsure of
my ability in the field.

29:49.551 --> 29:52.186
That's right.
Because you are inexperienced,

29:52.188 --> 29:54.654
Sebastian. And you haven't been
out in the field that much,

29:54.656 --> 29:56.690
but you know what else I said?

29:56.692 --> 29:59.359
I'd be willing to bet
you'd make a fantastic agent

29:59.361 --> 30:01.794
- if given a chance.
- Oh.

30:01.796 --> 30:04.630
Well, I-I guess they didn't
send the whole e-mail then.

30:04.632 --> 30:05.698
Exactly.

30:05.700 --> 30:07.633
So, now you know.

30:07.635 --> 30:09.635
May we please go to
the tattoo parlor?

30:09.637 --> 30:10.970
Yeah.

30:18.178 --> 30:20.245
Chimera ink? Yeah, I think I
bought some a few months ago.

30:20.247 --> 30:21.913
Up sell it to the tourists
when they want to

30:21.915 --> 30:23.381
bring a part of New
Orleans home with them.

30:23.383 --> 30:24.716
Barely ever use it.

30:24.718 --> 30:25.951
Can we see your supply?

30:25.953 --> 30:27.219
Why?

30:27.221 --> 30:29.654
It's in connection
with an ongoing investigation.

30:29.656 --> 30:31.623
It's somewhere in the back room,
you know, I don't really have...

30:31.625 --> 30:32.557
Oh, don't worry,
I-I can go check it out.

30:32.559 --> 30:33.859
Wait, hold on, man.

30:33.861 --> 30:34.825
I got it organized in a very
particular way, all right?

30:34.827 --> 30:36.460
I'll just show you.
Okay, all right,

30:36.462 --> 30:39.029
look, I still have a few more
questions for you first.

30:39.031 --> 30:40.430
Sebastian, go ahead.

30:40.432 --> 30:43.333
You ever seen this man?

30:47.573 --> 30:49.539
This is organized?

30:54.445 --> 30:56.479
Oh, hey, man, I'm sorry.

30:56.481 --> 30:57.914
I-I didn't realize
you were there.

30:57.916 --> 30:59.348
Yeah, no worries, man.

30:59.350 --> 31:00.549
Catching some Z's, huh?

31:00.551 --> 31:01.550
Rough night?

31:01.552 --> 31:03.486
You could say that.

31:03.488 --> 31:05.021
Uh, any chance
that you could help me

31:05.023 --> 31:06.756
find the Chimera?

31:06.758 --> 31:08.124
The what now?

31:08.126 --> 31:09.258
The ink.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.526
Oh, right. Yeah, sure.

31:11.528 --> 31:13.662
Chimera.
Yeah.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.397
I'll help you look.
Okay.

31:16.801 --> 31:20.335
I imagine, uh, most people
get tattoos at night, huh?

31:20.337 --> 31:22.604
It's not often you wake up
first thing in the morning

31:22.606 --> 31:24.539
and saying, “Hey, I want a
naked lady riding a dragon

31:24.541 --> 31:25.774
across my chest.”

31:25.776 --> 31:28.042
Yeah, sounds
about right.

31:34.317 --> 31:35.850
Looking for this, right?

31:35.852 --> 31:37.718
Uh, yeah. That's
great, thank you.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.320
I'm just gonna ask you
to move out of my way...

31:39.322 --> 31:41.255
Yeah, I can't do that.
Okay.

31:41.257 --> 31:42.923
It's not really a request.
See, I'm a Federal Agent.

31:52.935 --> 31:54.467
Sebastian!

31:54.469 --> 31:55.568
You all right?

31:55.570 --> 31:56.703
I think it was the killer.

31:56.705 --> 31:58.471
He got a gun,
he went out the back.

32:05.346 --> 32:06.745
<i>Pulled DNA</i>

32:06.747 --> 32:07.947
from the tattoo parlor,

32:07.949 --> 32:10.149
identified our suspect
as Damon Yang.

32:10.151 --> 32:13.085
He's affiliated with
the Seven Eagles Triad.

32:13.087 --> 32:15.287
They're based in Shanghai
and San Francisco,

32:15.289 --> 32:17.355
where Damon is
from originally.

32:17.357 --> 32:19.623
Looks like he's been in
New Orleans the past few months.

32:19.625 --> 32:22.327
Holing up at a tattoo shop
and Triad front.

32:22.329 --> 32:24.329
The manager of the shop's
not affiliated.

32:24.331 --> 32:26.564
Knows nothing about
Seven Eagles business.

32:26.566 --> 32:28.867
That's because there is no
Seven Eagles business.

32:28.869 --> 32:30.601
The FBI busted
them last year.

32:30.603 --> 32:32.270
Shut down their
entire leadership.

32:32.272 --> 32:34.938
Including Damon's father,
Derek Yang.

32:34.940 --> 32:37.774
What's the connection
between Damon and Ethan Beck?

32:37.776 --> 32:39.843
There doesn't seem
to be one.

32:39.845 --> 32:43.747
Except for the fact that he
specializes in cyber crimes,

32:43.749 --> 32:46.850
identity theft,
credit card fraud.

32:46.852 --> 32:48.585
He was prodigious.

32:48.587 --> 32:50.854
And look at
his neck tat.

32:51.956 --> 32:53.555
438.

32:53.557 --> 32:57.260
Triads use numeric codes
to distinguish their ranks.

32:57.262 --> 32:58.861
Mean something to you?

32:58.863 --> 33:01.030
Well, I was looking through
the Collective message boards

33:01.032 --> 33:02.731
for other suspects.

33:02.733 --> 33:05.301
There was someone whose
handle was “438”"

33:05.303 --> 33:06.969
Thinking Damon was
a Collective member, too?

33:06.971 --> 33:09.371
Maybe he joined up to get close
to Ethan Beck.

33:09.373 --> 33:11.039
They worked together
on breaching

33:11.041 --> 33:12.507
the Federal server farm.

33:12.509 --> 33:14.675
Then he kills Beck after
the files were stolen?

33:14.677 --> 33:16.211
What was he after?

33:16.213 --> 33:18.179
Elvis is working on
Ethan's computer,

33:18.181 --> 33:19.680
downloading all
the stolen files.

33:19.682 --> 33:21.082
Should check with him.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.951
Keep digging into Damon.

33:22.953 --> 33:25.685
We find out what
he was after, we find him.

33:26.855 --> 33:28.755
And, hey.

33:28.757 --> 33:31.858
No matter what any e-mails say,

33:31.860 --> 33:33.160
we're a team first.

33:33.162 --> 33:35.329
We got each other's backs,
right?

33:35.331 --> 33:37.564
Yeah.
Totally.

33:37.566 --> 33:38.832
We're good, King.

33:38.834 --> 33:41.601
Got to work on that enthusiasm.

33:47.309 --> 33:48.841
How you doing here, Elvis?

33:48.843 --> 33:50.109
I'm pissed.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.978
I mean, Ethan was
a son of a bitch.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.646
He was arrogant,
he was entitled,

33:53.648 --> 33:56.549
he thought he could start
world anarchy all by himself.

33:56.551 --> 33:59.017
But he did not deserve
to die this way.

33:59.019 --> 34:01.153
I mean, it's humiliating.
Ethan made his own choices.

34:01.155 --> 34:03.088
That's not on you.
No?

34:03.090 --> 34:04.689
When I met him,

34:04.691 --> 34:06.758
he was a professional
game tester, all right?

34:06.760 --> 34:08.879
I'm the one that put all those
ideas into his head.

34:08.902 --> 34:09.695
Okay.

34:09.696 --> 34:10.929
Then let's find his killer.

34:10.931 --> 34:12.397
What have you learned?

34:12.399 --> 34:13.731
Not much.

34:13.733 --> 34:15.600
I gave his computer
a full cavity search.

34:15.601 --> 34:19.070
I found hundreds of
thousands of classified files.

34:19.072 --> 34:20.571
But I wouldn't even
know where to start.

34:20.572 --> 34:22.739
O-Okay. Sit down, Elvis.

34:22.741 --> 34:27.210
Let's start
with, uh, Damon Yang.

34:27.213 --> 34:28.846
Seven Eagles Triad member,

34:28.848 --> 34:31.514
probably responsible
for all five murders.

34:31.516 --> 34:33.649
I got nothing on Damon Yang.

34:34.752 --> 34:35.952
But there is a Derek Yang.

34:35.954 --> 34:37.520
Damon's father.

34:37.522 --> 34:38.754
Former Triad leader.

34:38.755 --> 34:41.391
He was arrested
and is awaiting trial.

34:41.393 --> 34:42.725
Yes, he was arrested.

34:42.726 --> 34:45.462
But there was
no trial, Dwayne.

34:45.464 --> 34:47.429
These are different files
that I'm looking at.

34:47.431 --> 34:49.498
Triple encrypted, super secure.

34:49.501 --> 34:51.565
Of course Ethan broke the code.

34:51.568 --> 34:53.235
That's probably why
Damon needed him.

34:53.237 --> 34:54.402
What do the files say?

34:54.405 --> 34:56.105
It says that, uh,
Derek had ties

34:56.107 --> 34:59.241
to some pretty nasty
radical groups in Central Asia.

34:59.243 --> 35:02.144
So the CIA decided that
he could be a valuable asset.

35:02.146 --> 35:04.846
And they whisked him out of the
country before the indictment.

35:04.848 --> 35:06.715
Extraordinary Rendition.

35:06.717 --> 35:08.216
Does it say
where he was taken?

35:08.218 --> 35:09.783
No, it's a black site.

35:09.785 --> 35:12.253
But they do give the name
of the clandestine operative

35:12.255 --> 35:13.654
that interrogated him.

35:13.656 --> 35:14.955
Jordan Harper.

35:14.957 --> 35:17.958
Yeah, and he lives in a cabin

35:17.960 --> 35:20.128
in the middle of
nowhere, Louisiana.

35:20.130 --> 35:22.096
Damon's going after Harper
to find his father.

35:22.098 --> 35:24.631
Right, and he's got a head start
on you, so you better hurry.

35:26.535 --> 35:28.902
Harper's still not
answering his phone.

35:28.904 --> 35:31.405
Any word from the state troopers
we sent to check up on him?

35:31.407 --> 35:33.507
They aren't picking up,
either.

35:33.509 --> 35:34.707
This isn't good.

35:34.709 --> 35:36.510
Damon Yang could
be there already.

35:36.512 --> 35:37.844
But Damon needs Harper alive

35:37.846 --> 35:39.379
to tell him where his father is.

35:39.381 --> 35:41.014
So it gives us
a fighting chance.

35:41.016 --> 35:42.515
Cabin's 50 minutes up this road.

35:42.517 --> 35:44.116
We're running out of time.

35:44.118 --> 35:45.717
Yeah, but if we take
the ATV through the woods,

35:45.719 --> 35:47.653
we'll be there in less than 30.
Let's do it.

36:06.573 --> 36:09.474
You're good to go.

36:12.845 --> 36:14.412
Let's roll.

36:34.332 --> 36:36.566
Two dead, troopers.

36:40.671 --> 36:43.072
I see Harper.
No sign of Damon.

36:43.074 --> 36:44.873
Well, he's got to
be here somewhere.

36:44.875 --> 36:47.276
Let's move.

37:01.425 --> 37:03.291
Damon Yang!

37:03.293 --> 37:05.927
NCIS!
You got nowhere to run!

37:05.929 --> 37:08.429
Then I guess we'll
all die here together!

37:26.490 --> 37:28.729
Damon, listen,

37:28.783 --> 37:30.950
we all want to end this
peacefully.

37:30.952 --> 37:33.786
Look, no one has to get hurt.
Just put down your weapon,

37:33.788 --> 37:35.288
and let us have Harper.

37:35.290 --> 37:37.524
You want him?
Come and get him.

37:55.376 --> 37:58.043
Where you guys at?
Ten minutes out. What's up?

37:58.045 --> 37:59.843
We're pinned down
and we're taking fire.

37:59.845 --> 38:02.046
Damon's got Harper
barricaded in the cabin.

38:02.048 --> 38:02.763
We need a way in.

38:02.787 --> 38:05.063
That cabin is a
survivalist's dream house.

38:05.318 --> 38:07.985
Walls are fortified, electricity
and security system run on

38:07.987 --> 38:09.820
their own dedicated
network off the grid.

38:09.822 --> 38:11.755
I mean, if he doesn't want you
in, you're not getting in.

38:11.757 --> 38:14.559
Maybe, but maybe not.
Give me something, guys!

38:14.561 --> 38:16.593
I'm say we do to that cabin
what Ethan Beck did to us.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.395
You're gonna hack the system?

38:18.397 --> 38:20.997
I'm setting up a virus to infect
the cabin's dedicated network.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.532
That should give you guys
about 90 seconds

38:22.534 --> 38:23.900
before the system reboots.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.735
Whatever you do, do it fast.

38:25.737 --> 38:26.945
Man, it's like watching
da Vinci.

38:26.969 --> 38:28.969
Again, creepy.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.240
Last chance to tell me

38:30.242 --> 38:31.241
where they're keeping my father.

38:31.243 --> 38:32.408
Okay, guys.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.310
Here goes nothing.

38:49.459 --> 38:51.626
You stay with Harper!
I'm getting Damon!

39:15.651 --> 39:18.051
Put the weapon down now!

39:18.053 --> 39:19.786
No where to go, Damon.

39:19.788 --> 39:22.021
We got you covered!

39:50.150 --> 39:52.183
<i>Honestly, there are no excuses.</i>

39:52.185 --> 39:54.286
I made some bad choices.

39:54.288 --> 39:55.654
And I'm not proud of them.

39:55.656 --> 39:57.821
Look, Amy, I'm human.

39:57.823 --> 39:59.990
Flawed like anyone.

39:59.992 --> 40:02.259
But you know what else I am?
Grateful.

40:02.261 --> 40:05.462
That I was able to provide
valuable assistance to NCIS

40:05.464 --> 40:06.897
and put an end to this madness

40:06.899 --> 40:08.865
before anyone else got hurt.

40:09.968 --> 40:11.868
Oh, Hamilton the hero.

40:11.870 --> 40:13.604
What a snake.

40:13.606 --> 40:15.905
He's gonna walk away from
this whole thing unscathed.

40:15.907 --> 40:17.840
You think so?

40:17.842 --> 40:20.910
Ooh, I know that tone, Dwayne.

40:20.912 --> 40:22.545
You've gone a few rounds
with the mayor,

40:22.547 --> 40:24.514
haven't you?

40:24.516 --> 40:26.749
And I have a few more
rounds left to go.

40:26.751 --> 40:28.050
Well, brother,

40:28.052 --> 40:29.752
if the time ever comes,

40:29.754 --> 40:32.220
I'd love to help you take that
creep down a notch or three.

40:32.222 --> 40:34.756
Until then,
I'm out of here.

40:34.758 --> 40:36.491
Leaving without
a good-bye drink?

40:36.493 --> 40:39.494
Oh, I raided your cabinet
when I was planning my exit.

40:39.496 --> 40:41.930
What? At least come down

40:41.932 --> 40:43.765
to the bar, all right?
Celebrate with the team.

40:43.767 --> 40:44.286
Come on.

40:44.310 --> 40:46.310
Team? Team is
your thing, my friend.

40:46.670 --> 40:48.236
My thing is different.

40:48.238 --> 40:50.538
By the way, I'm sending your
people a little something

40:50.540 --> 40:52.873
to remember me by.

40:52.875 --> 40:54.074
Well, that sounds ominous.

40:54.076 --> 40:55.976
Nah.

40:55.978 --> 40:58.479
It's just my way
of saying thank you.

40:59.949 --> 41:01.782
Stay frosty, my friend.

41:10.158 --> 41:13.259
♪ Yeah, on what
you're starting to doubt ♪

41:14.663 --> 41:17.096

Not again.

41:45.291 --> 41:47.091
Why are we still
getting e-mails?

41:47.093 --> 41:48.526
This case is over.

41:48.528 --> 41:51.328
Yeah, we've already
been through this.

41:51.330 --> 41:54.131
We've apologized to
each other ad nauseam.

41:54.133 --> 41:57.667
Look, the best solution
is for us all to agree

41:57.669 --> 41:59.302
to erase them all

41:59.304 --> 42:00.408
without looking at them.

42:00.409 --> 42:02.706
I think that's a great idea.
Okay.

42:08.614 --> 42:10.146
Oh, wait.

42:10.148 --> 42:11.782
These are different.

42:11.784 --> 42:13.949
Oh, yeah,
these are nice.

42:13.951 --> 42:17.386
Gregorio,
that's so sweet.

42:17.388 --> 42:19.455
You think you can learn
a lot from me?

42:19.457 --> 42:21.223
Don't go getting mushy
on me, okay?

42:22.760 --> 42:26.429
I'm guessing you received
Elvis' good-bye present.

42:26.431 --> 42:28.564
He must've reverse engineered
the schadenfreude algorithm

42:28.566 --> 42:30.032
to only search out
the good things

42:30.034 --> 42:31.399
we wrote about each other.

42:31.401 --> 42:32.867
Which I am sure far
outnumbered the bad.

42:32.869 --> 42:34.135
All right.

42:34.137 --> 42:36.137
Let's get down to business.

42:36.139 --> 42:37.839
Here's to Sebastian

42:37.841 --> 42:40.041
for getting through
your first case

42:40.043 --> 42:42.477
with minimal injuries.

42:42.479 --> 42:44.378
Well done, dear.
To Sebastian!
