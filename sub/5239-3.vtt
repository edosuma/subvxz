00:08.946 --> 00:11.435
- Let her go, Officer.
- Put your hands on the car.

00:11.437 --> 00:13.082
Hey!

00:13.083 --> 00:15.952
Mr. Blunt, have you spoken
to any of your wives?

00:15.953 --> 00:19.569
I have not spoken to any of my ex-wives.

00:19.571 --> 00:20.988
This is the benefit of divorce.

00:20.990 --> 00:23.274
You are facing felony charges.

00:23.276 --> 00:25.244
Your ratings have been shit for months.

00:25.245 --> 00:26.362
All that's left is your accent.

00:26.363 --> 00:28.280
They need me to see a shrink.

00:28.281 --> 00:30.249
You always bring your own couch, Doctor?

00:30.250 --> 00:32.368
Yes, I'm a Freudian.

00:32.369 --> 00:34.837
The gods have given me a second chance.

00:34.838 --> 00:36.756
I mean to make the most of it.

What's the matter, Major?

01:48.361 --> 01:49.995
You always enjoy thrashing me.

01:49.996 --> 01:51.831
I don't know, Harry.

01:51.832 --> 01:53.699
I just feel low.

01:53.700 --> 01:56.368
Lost, confused, distracted,

01:56.369 --> 02:00.206
dreary, disturbed... I guess that's it.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.675
Well, you're seeing the network
psychoanalyst this afternoon, sir.

02:02.676 --> 02:04.710
Perhaps he'll cheer you up.

02:04.711 --> 02:07.847
I don't think the goal of analysis is to be
cheered up, Harry.

02:07.848 --> 02:11.550
I think the goal is to stop hating oneself.

02:11.551 --> 02:14.553
What about neutrality, sir?
That's my position.

02:14.554 --> 02:18.274
I don't hate myself,
but I don't like myself.

02:18.275 --> 02:19.892
I hover somewhere in the middle.

02:19.893 --> 02:21.560
Interesting, Harry.

02:21.561 --> 02:24.730
I'd like to mull that over
further with scrambled egg,

02:24.731 --> 02:27.950
bacon, half a grapefruit,
and very black coffee.

02:27.951 --> 02:30.568
Very good, sir. I'll get
your breakfast ready.

02:33.990 --> 02:36.375
Unsporting, Major.

02:36.376 --> 02:38.244
We'd finished playing.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.412
And a glass of champagne.

02:40.413 --> 02:42.831
<i>Sir.</i>

02:42.832 --> 02:46.969
<i>Kierkegaard says
that we're all in despair</i>

02:46.970 --> 02:48.888
<i>unless we find God.</i>

02:48.889 --> 02:51.924
<i>But then the French poet Vigny says that</i>

02:51.925 --> 02:55.761
a calm despair is the essence of wisdom.

02:55.762 --> 02:59.348
For once I agree with a Frenchman.

02:59.349 --> 03:03.569
No, I accept my core despair.

03:03.570 --> 03:06.272
But what's your stance on self-loathing?

03:06.273 --> 03:07.773
Oh, I'm against it.

03:07.774 --> 03:10.993
Why do you ask? Are you self-loathing?

03:10.994 --> 03:12.528
No.

03:12.529 --> 03:14.246
Well, a little.

03:14.247 --> 03:15.447
Why?

03:15.448 --> 03:17.283
I put my career in jeopardy.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.784
I'm a lousy to middling father.

03:18.785 --> 03:21.954
And I've hurt every woman
I've ever been with.

03:21.955 --> 03:24.423
What do you think would lessen your
negative feelings about yourself?

03:24.424 --> 03:26.542
- Well, a woman.
- Walter.

03:26.543 --> 03:29.295
Excuse me, we're in session.

03:29.296 --> 03:31.463
Oh, sorry. I've never done therapy.

03:31.464 --> 03:33.682
I mean, I once called a suicide hotline.

03:33.683 --> 03:35.768
- <i>Years ago.</i>
- Excuse me, I mean, we're in session.

03:35.769 --> 03:39.305
Okay. Walter, you have to
be in makeup in 15 minutes.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.557
Okay.

03:41.558 --> 03:43.475
Now, that's an attractive woman.

03:43.476 --> 03:45.311
Have you had intercourse with her?

03:45.312 --> 03:47.479
No. She works for me.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.481
So what's holding you back
from meeting a woman?

03:49.482 --> 03:50.983
My track record.

03:50.984 --> 03:54.403
I'm afraid to start something new.

03:54.404 --> 03:57.656
All my relationships end in pain.

03:57.657 --> 04:00.492
Did that stop Elizabeth Taylor? No.

04:00.493 --> 04:05.297
So I give you permission to meet someone
new and not worry about the future.

04:05.298 --> 04:08.801
Are you suggesting I should
behave like Elizabeth Taylor?

04:08.802 --> 04:13.254
Yes. A messy life is a good life.

04:16.509 --> 04:19.762
Big Brother or mindful mother?

04:19.762 --> 04:21.897
In a statement issued today,

04:21.898 --> 04:24.650
Alvon says that its tracking chip,

04:24.651 --> 04:26.685
the size of a rice grain,

04:26.686 --> 04:29.355
can be implanted painlessly

04:29.356 --> 04:30.773
beneath your child's skin.

04:30.774 --> 04:34.360
Well, I'm not sure I like the sound

04:34.361 --> 04:37.746
of children being chipped
like the family pet.

04:37.747 --> 04:41.367
But I was also skeptical
of the mobile phone

04:41.368 --> 04:43.702
and I once did lose a dog.

04:43.703 --> 04:47.256
Well, that's our report for this evening.

04:47.257 --> 04:51.377
I am Walter Blunt, right here, right now.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.879
<i>And we're clear. Okay, that's a wrap.</i>

04:53.880 --> 04:56.715
You know, soon we'll all be chipped.

04:56.716 --> 04:59.385
It could be a good thing.
If my wives had chipped me,

04:59.386 --> 05:00.886
maybe I'd still be married.

05:00.887 --> 05:02.855
Oh, did you get lost a lot?

05:02.856 --> 05:05.607
Yes, with other women.

05:05.608 --> 05:07.976
I must stop thinking like this.

05:07.977 --> 05:10.646
I am allowed to have a messy life.

05:10.647 --> 05:13.482
I mean, not as messy as last week, but...

05:13.483 --> 05:15.401
- Great show, Walter.
- Thank you.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.236
Excellent segment on the Knesset.

05:17.237 --> 05:19.405
Jewish politicians are really funny.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.240
Is that a joke?

05:21.241 --> 05:23.375
But, Walter, I'm so sorry
about interrupting

05:23.376 --> 05:25.294
your analysis before. Is it going okay?

05:25.295 --> 05:27.496
Well, the approach is unusual,

05:27.497 --> 05:29.381
but it may be helpful.

05:29.382 --> 05:32.384
Oh, you know, my dad's a therapist.
A Gestaltian.

05:32.385 --> 05:33.419
Yeah, we know that.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.587
- Hi. Great show, Walter.
- Thank you.

05:35.588 --> 05:37.423
Maybe next week we can run my piece

05:37.424 --> 05:39.758
on the HPV vaccine. I have a fun angle.

05:39.759 --> 05:42.928
Shelly, the genital warts story is gross.

05:42.929 --> 05:45.314
I'm sorry, genital warts?

05:45.315 --> 05:48.816
Uh-huh. It's relatable.

05:50.987 --> 05:53.522
You're a lucky son of a bitch, Walter.

05:53.523 --> 05:56.442
- Why?
<i>- I want to tell him!</i>

05:57.994 --> 05:59.445
You were in my bathroom.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.662
I paid for it.

06:00.663 --> 06:02.781
<i>The policeman you kicked,</i>

06:02.782 --> 06:04.783
he didn't need testicle surgery.

06:04.784 --> 06:07.286
So it's only a misdemeanor.

06:07.287 --> 06:09.955
The lawyers found a loophole
in California state law.

06:09.956 --> 06:12.958
No stitches, no felony.
No felony, no problem.

06:12.959 --> 06:17.262
I can't believe my fate was held in balance

06:17.263 --> 06:19.348
by the well-being of a testicle.

06:19.349 --> 06:20.632
What about Gisele?

06:20.633 --> 06:22.351
Her charges were dropped.

06:22.352 --> 06:23.635
Yes!

06:23.636 --> 06:25.521
She sent you a thank-you note

06:25.522 --> 06:26.855
for getting her a lawyer.

06:26.856 --> 06:29.140
Oh.

06:30.643 --> 06:32.644
In our debased world,

06:32.645 --> 06:34.446
I appreciate this very much.

06:34.447 --> 06:37.983
It was the one quality of the first
George Bush I always admired.

06:37.984 --> 06:40.869
He was an avid writer of thank-you notes.

06:40.870 --> 06:42.654
Well, you're still a little screwed, buddy.

06:42.655 --> 06:44.656
Your license is suspended and you
have to go to AA once a week.

06:44.657 --> 06:47.576
I have to go to AA?

06:47.577 --> 06:50.496
For your AA meeting, I was thinking

06:50.497 --> 06:52.881
we could either go with your Bono look

06:52.882 --> 06:54.967
or your Peter Jennings.

06:54.968 --> 06:57.386
For AA, definitely we should go Bono.

06:57.387 --> 06:59.471
Very good, sir.

06:59.472 --> 07:01.723
Oh, I meant to inquire,

07:01.724 --> 07:03.675
did you ask the psychoanalyst

07:03.676 --> 07:05.060
for more of that wonderful cocaine?

07:05.061 --> 07:10.349
I did and he said that last week
was simply an emergency measure

07:10.350 --> 07:11.984
and not a part of my treatment.

07:11.985 --> 07:13.852
Oh, that is a shame.

07:13.853 --> 07:17.188
But I imagine we'll cultivate
an emergency soon enough.

07:19.659 --> 07:21.743
All right, last chance.

07:21.744 --> 07:23.445
Who wants to come with me to AA?

07:23.446 --> 07:25.998
Ha! I understand.

07:25.999 --> 07:27.866
It's Friday, you've all got plans.

07:27.867 --> 07:30.419
Oh, there she is.

07:30.420 --> 07:32.287
I'll give you a ride.

07:32.288 --> 07:33.839
Be nicer than the bus.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.290
Thank you, Rosalie.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.259
I've missed you, girl.

07:37.260 --> 07:38.877
Hey. Walter, is this your new car?

07:38.878 --> 07:39.795
We got it this morning.

07:39.796 --> 07:42.764
I told Harry to get a Volt or a Prius.

07:42.765 --> 07:45.350
I mean, I have to be a role model.

07:45.351 --> 07:47.886
Instead, he gets this stupid muscle car.

07:47.887 --> 07:50.272
You said to follow my bliss.

07:50.273 --> 07:53.275
I said a Volt or a Prius.
You willfully misheard me.

07:53.276 --> 07:55.877
Well, I think it's a super
cool car, Walter. I really do.

07:55.929 --> 07:59.981
I'm glad you agree. I've always
admired your Maverick, Jim.

08:09.242 --> 08:11.193
This back seat is hell, Harry.

08:11.194 --> 08:13.612
What were you thinking?

08:13.613 --> 08:15.948
You could, you know,
sit in the front seat, sir.

08:15.949 --> 08:19.418
No, I think it's best
that our roles are defined.

08:19.419 --> 08:23.455
Discipline in our regiment
of two has been slack of late.

08:23.456 --> 08:25.957
Very good, sir.

08:45.445 --> 08:47.646
Thanks for the ride, Rosalie.

08:47.647 --> 08:49.280
You're welcome.

08:50.617 --> 08:53.902
Do you want to, you know,

08:53.903 --> 08:55.987
like last time?

09:12.472 --> 09:14.340
You smell nice.

09:14.341 --> 09:15.924
Like vanilla.

09:15.925 --> 09:18.260
Angel.

09:18.261 --> 09:19.511
The perfume.

09:19.512 --> 09:21.647
Can I smell it again?

09:26.019 --> 09:27.436
My God, Harry.

09:27.437 --> 09:29.905
I never knew there were so
many recovering alcoholics.

09:29.906 --> 09:32.191
- The bars must be empty.
- Yes, Major.

09:32.192 --> 09:35.527
You know, it's smart of
churches to hold AA meetings.

09:35.528 --> 09:37.496
Since the old methods failed,

09:37.497 --> 09:40.616
this is an excellent way
of getting the sinners in.

Overeaters Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous,

10:24.044 --> 10:25.961
Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous.

Boy, you name it, we got it.

- What are you here for?
- AA.

10:29.466 --> 10:33.085
Now, do you also know who could
sign my drunk driving sheet?

10:33.086 --> 10:34.303
Anybody can. I'll do it.

10:34.304 --> 10:36.220
Really? Thank you.

10:39.926 --> 10:42.061
Here you go.

10:42.062 --> 10:45.013
Are you Walter Blunt? I mean, Walter B?

10:45.014 --> 10:46.265
Most of the time.

10:46.266 --> 10:47.599
- I'm Derek.
- Oh.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.934
Ah, hi, I'm glad you're here.

10:48.935 --> 10:50.569
I saw your collapse on YouTube.

10:50.570 --> 10:52.688
It's an honor to meet you.

10:52.689 --> 10:54.440
Hey. I'll see you in the meeting.

10:54.441 --> 10:57.276
I'm also in AA.

10:57.277 --> 10:59.360
Hey, nice sort of chap.

11:01.281 --> 11:04.700
You know, Harry, I know nothing
about the 12-step movement.

11:04.701 --> 11:06.285
- Do you?
- Not really, sir.

11:06.286 --> 11:08.537
I imagine the 12 steps must be similar

11:08.538 --> 11:10.038
to the 10 Commandments.

11:10.039 --> 11:12.540
- Makes sense.
- Excuse me.

11:14.010 --> 11:16.011
A lot of women here, Harry.

11:16.012 --> 11:17.429
Maybe I'll meet someone.

11:17.430 --> 11:20.265
You know, alcoholics
are often good company.

11:20.266 --> 11:22.684
When they're drinking, sir.
Not when they're sober.

11:22.685 --> 11:25.137
Oh, no, you're right.

11:25.138 --> 11:29.057
Hey, maybe the Sex and Love Addicts meeting

11:29.058 --> 11:30.309
would be more up my alley.

11:30.310 --> 11:31.693
I would agree, sir.

11:31.694 --> 11:34.313
I think I'll go to the gambling meeting.

11:34.314 --> 11:36.482
That's a good idea. You love to gamble.

12:16.022 --> 12:19.074
What I do when I hit a cold streak

12:19.075 --> 12:21.326
is I borrow from friends,

12:21.327 --> 12:23.529
or anyone, really,

12:23.530 --> 12:24.913
until I hit a hot streak.

12:24.914 --> 12:27.115
<i>Then I pay everybody back.</i>

12:27.116 --> 12:30.002
This way, I never get too far ahead

12:30.003 --> 12:31.920
or too far behind.

12:31.921 --> 12:34.957
A kind of beautiful stasis.

12:34.958 --> 12:38.177
You see, I live in the now,

12:38.178 --> 12:40.929
which is what all the gurus preach.

12:44.601 --> 12:46.384
Oh.

12:50.974 --> 12:53.475
So, Walter still behaving himself?

12:53.476 --> 12:55.561
Well, he's functioning.

12:55.562 --> 12:56.945
And now he's going to AA.

12:56.946 --> 12:58.530
AA? That's terrible.

12:58.531 --> 13:01.366
Maybe it could help him. It helped Charlie.

13:01.367 --> 13:02.951
Charlie? He committed suicide.

13:02.952 --> 13:05.237
- But he was sober.
- Well, that's true.

13:05.238 --> 13:07.656
Charge! That's my new toast.

13:11.711 --> 13:14.161
Mmm.

13:15.248 --> 13:18.083
Teddy, there's no vermouth in this.

13:18.084 --> 13:20.002
Oh, shit, you're right.

13:20.003 --> 13:21.553
- I'll make new ones.
- Forget it.

13:21.554 --> 13:24.305
We're playing gin,
we'll have gin cocktails.

13:27.093 --> 13:30.929
So, did you give that young
man a ride home again?

13:30.930 --> 13:33.265
- It's Friday.
- I did.

13:33.266 --> 13:35.434
I told him we have an open marriage.

13:35.435 --> 13:38.020
- Mm-hmm.
- The whole thing was wonderful.

13:38.021 --> 13:40.155
My heart was racing.

13:40.156 --> 13:42.524
It's good for you.
Good for your circulation.

13:42.525 --> 13:45.444
I met a woman, you know, at
the salad bar at Whole Foods.

13:45.445 --> 13:48.330
Twice divorced. Very beautiful.
Persian. Lonely.

13:48.331 --> 13:51.366
But she name-dropped the Shah and
I gave her a hard time about it

13:51.367 --> 13:52.951
'cause I didn't really believe her.

13:52.952 --> 13:56.038
You told me about her two nights ago.

13:56.039 --> 13:57.956
I did?

13:57.957 --> 14:01.093
I meet so many divorcées
that I can hardly keep track.

14:01.094 --> 14:02.961
That salad bar is like a singles bar.

14:02.962 --> 14:06.682
Anyway, she emailed me a picture
of her and the Shah from '78,

14:06.683 --> 14:08.933
so I had to apologize.

14:11.187 --> 14:13.639
I've been sticking to my
bottom lines for three weeks.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.973
No acting out.

14:19.062 --> 14:21.029
Thank you. As most of you know,

14:21.030 --> 14:23.982
my thing is to wear baggy
shorts, you know, no underwear.

14:23.983 --> 14:26.151
Then I ride the M52 bus.

14:26.152 --> 14:29.154
And then I cross my legs
like, you know, like this.

14:29.155 --> 14:32.291
You know, and I just hope somebody sees

14:32.292 --> 14:34.993
what I have hidden up here.
My noodle and my wantons.

14:34.994 --> 14:38.547
I mean, it's a sickness, but I've
been better the last three weeks.

14:38.548 --> 14:40.582
I mean, I still ride the bus
when I don't have to,

14:40.583 --> 14:43.001
but I wear my underwear every time.

14:43.002 --> 14:45.253
So thanks for letting me share.

14:45.254 --> 14:47.388
Thanks for sharing.

14:49.926 --> 14:51.176
And thanks for wearing
your underwear this week.

14:51.177 --> 14:52.510
Thank you.

14:55.515 --> 14:58.233
Hello, I'm Walter. I am not a sex addict.

14:58.234 --> 15:01.019
But I have enjoyed listening to you all.

15:01.020 --> 15:03.939
To be honest, though, I find this label

15:03.940 --> 15:06.441
sexual addiction to be shaming.

15:06.442 --> 15:09.695
When it comes to desire, I mean, desire,

15:09.696 --> 15:11.663
what you call acting out,

15:11.664 --> 15:14.533
it would be wise to remind ourselves

15:14.534 --> 15:17.202
of how Elizabeth Taylor lived.

15:17.203 --> 15:19.421
<i>And what Oscar Wilde said.</i>

15:19.422 --> 15:22.924
"The only way to get rid of temptation

15:22.925 --> 15:25.043
is to yield to it."

15:29.716 --> 15:31.550
Thanks for sharing.

15:31.551 --> 15:34.385
Thanks for sharing.

15:37.607 --> 15:39.357
<i>♪</i>

15:42.311 --> 15:44.196
Can I help you?

15:44.197 --> 15:47.649
Yes, I do need help.

15:47.650 --> 15:51.869
Um, do you have that one in a size six?

15:53.072 --> 15:54.406
- This?
- Yes.

15:54.407 --> 15:57.542
- For your wife?
- No, girlfriend.

15:57.543 --> 15:59.711
I'm not ready for marriage.

15:59.712 --> 16:02.247
Okay, I will see if we have those in a six.

16:02.248 --> 16:03.914
Okay.

16:08.254 --> 16:11.923
You know, you're the first
professional magician I've ever met.

16:11.924 --> 16:13.258
Well, that's a lot of pressure.

16:13.259 --> 16:14.926
And I saw women in half for a living.

16:14.927 --> 16:17.979
My dad used to
love doing magic tricks.

16:17.980 --> 16:20.015
Used to? Why did he stop, the old bastard?

16:20.016 --> 16:24.019
Um, he died when I was
12 in a car accident.

16:24.020 --> 16:26.071
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.689
No need to worry. It was a long time ago.

16:27.690 --> 16:31.193
No, I'm sorry for being
such a downer on a date.

16:31.194 --> 16:33.111
It's okay, I asked.

16:33.112 --> 16:35.280
I do miss him still.

16:35.281 --> 16:38.533
He used to teach the piano.

16:38.534 --> 16:39.701
I think that's why he liked magic.

16:39.702 --> 16:41.453
He had such agile fingers.

16:41.454 --> 16:44.122
He had beautiful hands. I
used to love looking at them.

16:44.123 --> 16:47.259
What, you also have very pretty hands.

16:47.260 --> 16:50.262
Could you do a trick right here?

16:50.263 --> 16:52.547
A trick? I totally didn't come prepared.

16:52.548 --> 16:55.016
Do you mind if I smoke?
Disgusting habit, I know,

16:55.017 --> 16:56.968
- but then so's this.
- Ah.

16:56.969 --> 16:58.603
Whoa. So's that. Whoa.

16:58.604 --> 17:00.605
That's how we smoke cigarettes in LA.

17:00.606 --> 17:03.475
No, I'm kidding. Hand me the
salt shaker, would you?

17:03.476 --> 17:05.977
All right, keep your eyes on this.

17:05.978 --> 17:07.229
Here we go. Here's the salt.

17:07.230 --> 17:09.698
Or as I call it, the other white powder.

17:09.699 --> 17:11.950
Keep your eyes on it. Keep your eyes on it.

17:11.951 --> 17:13.568
It's a lot of salt going in the hand.

17:13.569 --> 17:16.154
I wave my hand and say the magic words,

17:16.155 --> 17:19.324
Bangers and Match, boop, it's gone.

17:19.325 --> 17:20.659
- Wow!
- Yeah.

17:20.660 --> 17:23.494
I'll bring it back for you,
it's... a grain at a time.

17:23.496 --> 17:26.164
There's a grain.
That's gonna take too long.

17:26.165 --> 17:28.500
Here's a grain. Hold your hand out for me.

17:32.505 --> 17:33.921
Are you married?

17:36.175 --> 17:37.892
Um...

17:44.934 --> 17:46.518
Hey, I really appreciate this.

17:46.519 --> 17:48.653
And I think you're gonna
be an awesome sponsor.

17:48.654 --> 17:50.021
- I'll call you.
- You're welcome.

17:50.022 --> 17:51.990
- Thank you.
- Hi.

17:51.991 --> 17:54.993
Hi. I want to thank you for
what you shared in there.

17:54.994 --> 17:57.028
I've been coming to these
meetings for months

17:57.029 --> 17:59.664
and you are the first person
who's made any sense.

17:59.665 --> 18:03.034
Well, I'm glad if what I had to say helped.

18:03.035 --> 18:05.036
It was very helpful. Usually these meetings

18:05.037 --> 18:07.172
make me feel worse about
myself, not better.

18:07.173 --> 18:10.542
That's not good.
I struggle with that myself.

18:10.543 --> 18:13.044
Attacking myself mentally.

18:13.045 --> 18:15.180
I'm sorry that things haven't
gone well for you here.

18:15.181 --> 18:18.517
It's all right. There's a
reason I've been coming to SLAA

18:18.518 --> 18:20.968
and it was to hear
what you had to say tonight.

18:22.305 --> 18:26.358
And to meet you.

18:28.945 --> 18:31.396
Several women rabbis have been arrested

18:31.397 --> 18:33.565
and a protest at the Wailing Wall

18:33.566 --> 18:36.067
has spurred debate in the Knesset.

18:36.068 --> 18:38.069
The issue of women rabbis

18:38.070 --> 18:41.039
<i>has been an ongoing controversy
for several years now.</i>

18:41.040 --> 18:42.707
<i>A coalition of American...</i>

18:42.708 --> 18:46.127
Ah, I love a woman with a clean bathroom.

18:46.128 --> 18:49.914
Almost fell off.

18:54.971 --> 18:57.254
- What is that?
- What?

18:58.341 --> 19:01.141
- Wow.
- Wow.

19:02.261 --> 19:03.844
Mm.

19:30.923 --> 19:32.958
Fucking hate this car, Harry.

19:35.127 --> 19:37.012
Oh, how charming.

19:37.013 --> 19:39.631
Oh, thanks. I do love living here.

19:39.632 --> 19:42.133
And my place is right over there.

19:42.134 --> 19:43.635
- Oh, lovely.
- Yes.

19:43.636 --> 19:45.937
Um, just one moment, darling.

19:45.938 --> 19:48.440
I need to have a word with my man.

19:48.441 --> 19:50.358
Sure.

19:50.359 --> 19:53.979
Major, I advise against this.
This woman is a sex addict.

19:53.980 --> 19:56.982
Shh, don't be ridiculous, Harry.
There's no such thing.

19:56.983 --> 20:00.318
Also, my analyst encouraged
me to meet someone.

20:00.319 --> 20:01.987
This is part of my treatment.

20:01.988 --> 20:04.155
I liked it better when he gave you cocaine.

20:04.156 --> 20:05.657
Stop pouting, Harry.

20:05.658 --> 20:08.940
Look, I'll only be gone an hour or so.

20:08.978 --> 20:12.447
And we'll kiss a little
and I'll call it a night.

20:12.448 --> 20:15.150
Like a gentleman.

20:15.151 --> 20:17.485
So, wait here.

20:17.486 --> 20:18.986
Yes, sir.

20:20.873 --> 20:22.574
- Oh, are you cold?
- Just a little.

20:22.575 --> 20:25.243
Oh, my. I'm so sorry.

20:25.244 --> 20:27.912
And surely the house...
The whole house is yours.

20:38.558 --> 20:40.392
<i>I think you look tired.</i>

20:40.393 --> 20:42.344
<i>Have you had a steak lately?</i>

20:42.345 --> 20:44.095
Mom, you know I don't eat meat.

20:44.096 --> 20:46.932
I wish you would. You grew up on meat.

20:46.933 --> 20:48.934
You look pale.

20:48.935 --> 20:51.937
Would Walter want to do
phone sessions with me?

20:51.938 --> 20:54.189
I'm worried about him after his collapse.

20:54.190 --> 20:56.575
No, Dad, he's got a therapist here in LA.

20:56.576 --> 20:59.244
Fine.

20:59.245 --> 21:00.912
He'll be okay.

21:00.913 --> 21:03.198
Hey, Mom, when we FaceTime,

21:03.199 --> 21:06.117
do you look at the little picture
of yourself or do you look at me?

21:06.118 --> 21:08.787
I think I look at the
little picture of myself

21:08.788 --> 21:10.505
- more than I look at you.
- It's true.

21:10.506 --> 21:13.341
Yeah, me, too. I do that, too.

21:13.342 --> 21:16.795
Well, I better get going, Mom.
It's Friday night.

21:16.796 --> 21:18.296
I love you.

21:18.297 --> 21:20.265
I love you more than that.

21:20.266 --> 21:22.132
Okay, bye.

21:46.409 --> 21:49.410
Should we slow down a little?

21:50.880 --> 21:52.547
No, let's go faster.

21:54.216 --> 21:55.383
Ah!

21:55.384 --> 21:56.885
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

21:56.886 --> 21:58.970
I met the most interesting Persian woman.

21:58.971 --> 22:00.472
A Sophia Loren look-alike.

22:00.473 --> 22:02.057
Huge, gorgeous brown eyes.

22:02.058 --> 22:03.892
And she told me that the Shah put his hand

22:03.893 --> 22:06.511
on her leg at a dinner party in 1978.

22:06.512 --> 22:08.345
- Teddy.
- Yes, dear?

22:13.102 --> 22:14.903
I love you.

22:14.904 --> 22:16.737
I love you.

22:21.077 --> 22:23.244
Sophie, what the hell are you doing?

22:24.530 --> 22:26.865
Holy shit. Walter fucking Blunt?

22:26.866 --> 22:28.867
- Who is this man?
- It's my husband Steve.

22:28.868 --> 22:30.285
<i>You said you were divorced.</i>

22:30.286 --> 22:32.003
I am, but
we still sleep together.

22:32.004 --> 22:34.873
He's in Codependents Anonymous.

22:34.874 --> 22:36.958
Oh, shit! Excuse me, Sophie.

22:36.959 --> 22:38.543
I can't believe you're
screwing Walter Blunt.

22:38.544 --> 22:40.879
Point of fact, we did not
engage in intercourse.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.847
Oh, you shut up. I don't like you.

22:42.848 --> 22:45.467
I don't like your show. And I
don't like you banging my wife.

22:45.468 --> 22:47.102
You keep my show out of this!

22:47.103 --> 22:50.805
Oh, fuck you. Right here, right now.

22:50.806 --> 22:52.222
No, no. Oh!

22:53.392 --> 22:56.310
Goddamn memory foam.

23:01.567 --> 23:03.234
Blunt! I'm gonna kill you!

23:03.235 --> 23:05.035
Shit!

23:07.406 --> 23:09.073
Oh, no.

23:11.577 --> 23:14.045
Harry! Harry!

23:14.046 --> 23:16.046
Row! Row!

23:17.833 --> 23:18.916
Motherfucker!

23:22.338 --> 23:24.922
Where you going? Coward!

23:26.926 --> 23:28.810
Row, Harry, row!

23:28.811 --> 23:31.845
<i>English bastard!</i>

23:32.982 --> 23:34.899
Fuck.

23:34.900 --> 23:37.268
Good man, Harry.

23:37.269 --> 23:39.938
Well, that could have gone better.

23:39.939 --> 23:43.241
But my analyst can't say I
didn't try to meet someone.

23:43.242 --> 23:46.077
Told you she was a sex fiend, sir.

23:46.078 --> 23:48.413
Don't be judgmental, Harry.

23:48.414 --> 23:50.031
What did Oscar Wilde say?

23:50.032 --> 23:52.167
"We're all in the gutter...

23:52.168 --> 23:55.286
