WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.537
Narrator: Tonight, Emma Grede,
founder and CEO

00:03.537 --> 00:05.706
of smash hit apparel brand
Good American

00:05.706 --> 00:08.976
and founding partner of SKIMS,
returns to the Tank.

00:08.976 --> 00:11.345
I really understand
direct to consumer,

00:11.345 --> 00:13.080
and I can really
help you unlock that.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.315
Honestly, we're like, this
deserves to exist in the world.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.851
Oy-yoy-yoy.
Are you insane?
What?!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.753
This deal for us
is about chasing

00:19.753 --> 00:20.921
the American dream.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.856
I need help --
like, I can't sustain this.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.291
Yadda-yadda-yadda,
woof-woof-woof.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.792
I don't care.
Typical guy.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.504
Narrator: First in the Tank
is a business

00:37.504 --> 00:40.874
that utilizes food waste
in a delicious way.

00:48.782 --> 00:49.816
Hi, Sharks.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.518
My name
is Kaitlin Mogentale,

00:51.518 --> 00:53.754
and I'm here
seeking $500,000

00:53.754 --> 00:57.958
in exchange for 10% equity
in my company, Pulp Pantry.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.328
Sharks, I know you like
talking numbers,

01:01.328 --> 01:02.930
so let me throw some at you.

01:02.930 --> 01:07.334
In the United States,
we waste 54 million tons of food

01:07.334 --> 01:10.070
every single year.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.439
Can you believe that, normally,

01:12.439 --> 01:15.676
all of this gorgeous produce
would have been tossed?

01:15.676 --> 01:18.078
Or this --
the fiber left over

01:18.078 --> 01:19.980
from juicing fruits
and vegetables.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.583
This, too, normally
goes unloved.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.352
Talk about
a missed opportunity!

01:25.352 --> 01:27.087
Well, Sharks,
the madness stops with us,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.089
because Pulp Pantry
has developed a new way

01:29.089 --> 01:30.724
to snack with impact.

01:30.724 --> 01:33.460
We take the thousands of pounds
of organic produce

01:33.460 --> 01:36.563
that would otherwise go unloved
every single week

01:36.563 --> 01:39.132
and upcycle them
into a line of real veggie chips

01:39.132 --> 01:41.101
that are made from --
you guessed it --

01:41.101 --> 01:45.472
real, fresh vegetables --
not corn, not potato starch,

01:45.472 --> 01:48.241
and certainly not grains,
for that matter.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.210
We're spreading
the "good fibes" only

01:50.210 --> 01:51.945
with the delicious
and nutritious snack

01:51.945 --> 01:54.514
that's packed
with flavor and fiber,

01:54.514 --> 01:56.750
all the while tackling
one of our most pressing

01:56.750 --> 01:59.553
environmental issues --
food waste.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.722
Sharks, it's crunch time!

02:01.722 --> 02:03.957
Who's ready to dig in
and make a deal?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.792
We are.
I love.

02:06.994 --> 02:09.429
We have our sea salt,
salt vinegar,

02:09.429 --> 02:11.632
jalapeÃ±o lime, and barbecue.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.700
But the things to note
with the Pulp Chips --

02:13.700 --> 02:15.302
they're 100% vegan.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.504
They're grain-free,
they're gluten-free,

02:17.504 --> 02:19.039
and the best part
about it is,

02:19.039 --> 02:21.508
every serving has
five grams of fiber,

02:21.508 --> 02:22.542
meaning that a bag of chips

02:22.542 --> 02:25.178
is nearly
your day's serving of fiber.

02:25.178 --> 02:28.015
I'm amazed.
They're so good.
They're so delicious.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.750
I'm so happy you love them.
I mean, I can tell

02:29.750 --> 02:31.551
you're a woman
of impeccable taste

02:31.551 --> 02:33.120
because you're wearing
my Good American

02:33.120 --> 02:34.755
Fit For Success Jumpsuit --
well done. Yes.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.289
Lots of kissing up
going on.

02:36.289 --> 02:39.192
Lots of kissing up.
Ah. Just saying.

02:39.192 --> 02:41.728
Even better than the Jumpsuit,
these taste delicious. Good. Yeah.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.830
How are you getting
the starchy consistency

02:43.830 --> 02:46.600
that I would expect from,
you know, a grain?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.568
'Cause it's there.
It's just balancing

02:48.568 --> 02:49.836
the fresh ingredients
that we use,

02:49.836 --> 02:51.104
which is the fresh vegetables.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.306
We also add
cassava flour... Yeah.

02:53.306 --> 02:54.508
...and an okara flour,

02:54.508 --> 02:56.209
which is another
upcycled ingredient

02:56.209 --> 02:57.744
made from, actually,
the byproduct

02:57.744 --> 02:59.179
of tofu manufacturing.
So there's no gluten
in these at all?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.514
No gluten, no grains.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.982
If you look at the back
of a veggie chip

03:01.982 --> 03:03.750
in a normal grocery store,

03:03.750 --> 03:05.318
the first ingredient
you probably see

03:05.318 --> 03:08.388
is potato starch
or dried potato flakes.

03:08.388 --> 03:11.892
So we opted to create a version
that has no potatoes, either.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.061
Can you give me
the stack on pricing

03:14.061 --> 03:15.562
from the cost per bag... Yes.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.597
...wholesale pricing,
and retail?

03:17.597 --> 03:19.166
Just run through that.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.302
So, one bag costs $1.70
to produce.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.271
We wholesale for $3.24,

03:24.271 --> 03:27.441
and we're on shelves
at $4.99 to $5.49.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.342
How did you come up
with this idea?

03:29.342 --> 03:31.011
I got really interested
in sustainability

03:31.011 --> 03:32.512
when I was
just in eighth grade,

03:32.512 --> 03:34.915
and my mom took me to see
"An Inconvenient Truth,"

03:34.915 --> 03:36.550
the Al Gore documentary. Ohh.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.852
And environmental studies
was my degree.

03:38.852 --> 03:41.021
But I think
the big "aha" moment --

03:41.021 --> 03:43.690
I had a friend
who had driven off campus

03:43.690 --> 03:45.659
to buy a bunch
of organic produce

03:45.659 --> 03:46.927
and was juicing it.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.396
And I basically saw
these handfuls of pulp

03:49.396 --> 03:51.164
and then the tiniest amount
of juice.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.300
And she was like,
"I usually throw this away.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.668
I don't know
what to do with it."

03:54.668 --> 03:57.237
So I took it home, made my first
batch of carrot cookies.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.638
No.
Carrot cookies?

03:58.638 --> 03:59.973
Yes, it was carrot cookies.
Oh, I love it!

03:59.973 --> 04:01.274
And the idea was honestly

04:01.274 --> 04:03.376
just something I pitched
in a class project,

04:03.376 --> 04:06.213
and I just had professors
who honestly were like,

04:06.213 --> 04:07.848
"This deserves to exist
in the world.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.016
This is a huge problem."
Yeah.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.085
And I actually got a grant
from my university

04:12.085 --> 04:13.520
to get started
after graduating.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.022
But where are you getting
the pulp from now?

04:16.022 --> 04:17.057
Like, at scale?

04:17.057 --> 04:18.125
'Cause obviously,
you're selling it --

04:18.125 --> 04:19.359
So, now, at scale,
we actually work

04:19.359 --> 04:21.528
with two of the biggest
national juice brands

04:21.528 --> 04:22.662
in the country.
Oh, cool.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.531
For them,
there's so many challenges

04:24.531 --> 04:26.800
with the fact that there is
so much organic byproduct

04:26.800 --> 04:28.068
that they have to pay
a composter

04:28.068 --> 04:29.202
to take it off their hands.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.637
To take it away, yeah.
Or pay animal feed.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.105
So you come get it?
So, for them,
it's a benefit,

04:32.105 --> 04:34.074
because if we can
grow and absorb

04:34.074 --> 04:35.475
most of that byproduct,

04:35.475 --> 04:36.810
then it's actually
saving them money.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.245
Do you pay
for the veggies?

04:38.245 --> 04:41.081
So we do offer to
basically cover the labor --

04:41.081 --> 04:42.115
the cost of labor.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.216
Because they're gonna
have to pay

04:43.216 --> 04:44.851
for somebody else
to take it away.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.353
Exactly.
You basically just
do that for them

04:46.353 --> 04:47.821
so they have no expense. Yeah.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.956
So, what are you
doing in sales?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.158
We actually
finished last year

04:51.158 --> 04:53.994
with just under
$250,000 in sales.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.629
This calendar year,
how much?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.264
This calendar year,
we'll finish the year

04:57.264 --> 04:58.598
with just under $500,000.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.233
Okay, what are you
gonna make on that?

05:00.233 --> 05:02.202
$20,000 net,
so we are profitable.

05:02.202 --> 05:04.271
70% of our business
is retail.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.339
We're in about 600 doors,

05:06.339 --> 05:08.108
and about 20% of that

05:08.108 --> 05:09.676
is through third-party
e-commerce sites

05:09.676 --> 05:12.145
like Thrive Market,
Imperfect Produce.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.881
But you're asking me
to pay you 10 times sales

05:14.881 --> 05:16.550
for a nascent
snacking company

05:16.550 --> 05:19.085
that hasn't really
established distribution yet

05:19.085 --> 05:20.620
outside of
a couple of trials.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.189
So to speak
to the valuation --

05:22.189 --> 05:23.790
and what
I would say to that --

05:23.790 --> 05:25.125
you know, our run rate --
Well, you should speak
to the valuation.

05:25.125 --> 05:28.028
Well, let her.
Our run rate
the last quarter

05:28.028 --> 05:29.830
puts us at about $700,000.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.732
And the problem for us has been
less than 5% of our revenue

05:32.732 --> 05:35.335
in each of our channels
has been spent on marketing.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.605
I have a lot of experience in
this space, including Pipcorn.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.173
It's really competitive.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.008
I have to say, though,
I think the idea

05:42.008 --> 05:43.643
that you turn
someone else's garbage

05:43.643 --> 05:45.579
into a successful business
is amazing.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.214
That's the beauty of it.
The beauty of it.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.115
And not only that,
but on top of it,

05:49.115 --> 05:52.219
you have such passion
and a purpose.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.387
But unfortunately,
I think you're gonna have

05:54.387 --> 05:57.891
a tall mountain to climb
in the competitive space.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.460
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.562
Thank you, Barbara.
It was so nice to meet you.

06:02.562 --> 06:05.498
Kaitlin, how much is in
your bank account currently?

06:05.498 --> 06:06.900
About $20,000.

06:06.900 --> 06:07.901
Ohh.
Wow.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.036
So what's the lowest
you've ever been at?

06:10.036 --> 06:12.706
I don't know
if I should tell you.
Yeah, we've all
been negative.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.208
We've all been negative,
so don't feel bad, yeah.
You were negative?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.010
You know, I've definitely
seen it go down

06:17.010 --> 06:18.445
to, like, $1,000.

06:18.445 --> 06:21.314
I think the issue for us, again,
is these cash-flow cycles.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.250
You know, we want to do more
in-store promotions

06:23.250 --> 06:25.418
and kind of getting people
to try, maybe not in the --

06:25.418 --> 06:26.853
Now would be a great time
for you to say

06:26.853 --> 06:28.688
to the other Sharks,
"Give me some offers."

06:28.688 --> 06:30.023
"Let's go."

06:30.023 --> 06:32.259
Well, listen, I'll start.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.694
I don't think
you're worth $5 million,

06:34.694 --> 06:36.763
but I'll tell you,
you're very impressive.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.732
I've made a lot of money
investing in women.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.700
Sustainability --
check the box.

06:40.700 --> 06:44.371
Product is right on trend,
'cause I'm lowering my gluten.

06:44.371 --> 06:46.773
I think your business
is worth 2 million bucks,

06:46.773 --> 06:49.676
so I'll give you
$500,000 for 25%.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.411
Thank you for that offer,
Mr. Wonderful.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.812
Kaitlin, I'm gonna
make this easy

06:52.812 --> 06:55.282
so you can properly understand
your options, right?

06:55.282 --> 06:58.652
I actually, for once,
I agree with Mr. Wonderful.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.820
Like, I think the valuation's
a little nuts,

07:00.820 --> 07:03.957
and rather than give you
an offer that's insulting,

07:03.957 --> 07:05.425
I'm gonna drop out.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.693
But I do wish you
good luck,

07:06.693 --> 07:09.195
'cause I think you're
a fantastic entrepreneur.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.897
Thank you, Emma.
It was so nice to meet you.

07:10.897 --> 07:13.533
The thing for me is,
is I love what you're doing.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.801
Love, love, love it.

07:14.801 --> 07:19.639
But you're asking for
half a million dollars for 10%.

07:19.639 --> 07:22.542
I'm trying to figure out, like,
how long will it take

07:22.542 --> 07:25.145
for me
to see my money back?

07:25.145 --> 07:29.149
How about if I gave you
the $500,000 as a loan?

07:29.149 --> 07:31.851
Because that's -- it feels
a little safer to me.

07:31.851 --> 07:34.688
$500,000 as a loan
at 6% interest,

07:34.688 --> 07:36.589
which is less
than the going rate.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.558
Three years to pay it off.

07:38.558 --> 07:42.295
And then, I would still want
the 10% equity stake,

07:42.295 --> 07:44.264
because I gotta go
to work for you, right?

07:44.264 --> 07:46.199
And I've gotta help you,
and I've gotta give you

07:46.199 --> 07:48.435
all the knowledge
that I know in the food space.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.203
That's my offer.
Thank you, Lori.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.671
But you've got
two offers, okay?

07:51.671 --> 07:52.672
That's good. Yep.

07:52.672 --> 07:53.773
Mark, what are you gonna do?

08:05.585 --> 08:06.920
Narrator:
Two Sharks are out.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.655
Kaitlin has two offers
on the table

08:08.655 --> 08:10.957
from Kevin and Lori
for Pulp Pantry --

08:10.957 --> 08:13.593
chips made from recycled
vegetable waste --

08:13.593 --> 08:15.662
but Mark
may also be interested.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.497
You've got two offers, okay?
That's good.
Mogentale: Yep.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.733
Mark, what are you gonna do?

08:19.733 --> 08:21.001
Cuban: Okay,
I'm gonna give you a list

08:21.001 --> 08:24.437
of my "Shark Tank"
companies.

08:24.437 --> 08:25.972
MUSH...

08:25.972 --> 08:27.907
Pan's Mushroom Jerky,

08:27.907 --> 08:30.310
P-nuffs, Wanna Date?

08:30.310 --> 08:33.580
Unreal Deli, SNACKLINS,
Nuts 'N More,

08:33.580 --> 08:37.417
Truffle Shuffle, Numilk,
Everything Legendary.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.520
All these are companies
in your category. Yeah.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.389
Companies that are
on a mission

08:42.389 --> 08:43.656
to make the world
a better place

08:43.656 --> 08:45.091
and to make people healthier.

08:45.091 --> 08:48.628
I understand the category,
and so I'll make you an offer,

08:48.628 --> 08:51.264
and it's going to be
500K for 20%.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.000
And I can tell you
that, you know,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.668
when you walk in the door,
we all know

08:55.668 --> 08:57.137
every entrepreneur
has that limit.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.472
That number that they don't
want to go above. Yeah.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.174
But you have to ask yourself,
where can you get to?

09:01.174 --> 09:03.676
Yeah.
Because that's really
where the value comes from.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.011
What is this company
gonna look like

09:05.011 --> 09:06.946
in two years
with or without me?

09:06.946 --> 09:08.581
Five years, ten years?

09:08.581 --> 09:11.151
And can you go alone
so you don't have to sell,

09:11.151 --> 09:12.886
so you can stick
to your mission?
Yeah.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.421
Take the offer.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.923
Sorry, I have
a Pulp Chip in my throat.
Listen -- Oh, bless you.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.926
Kaitlin,
you've got three offers.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.127
You've got three offers.
You know what?

09:21.127 --> 09:22.629
You gonna change your offer?
For me...

09:22.629 --> 09:24.330
I'm just gonna say, like, I --

09:24.330 --> 09:25.498
Mark gave a good offer.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.267
He gave out his list.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.202
I actually --
I just love food.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.703
And...

09:30.703 --> 09:33.006
So I have a list -- I have
Pizza Cupcake, Bantam Bagel.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.641
You know, I mean,
I could rattle off... Yeah.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.009
...all of my successes and...

09:36.009 --> 09:38.078
But the difference is, these are
all sustainable companies

09:38.078 --> 09:40.046
that have a focus
on sustainability.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.782
And they have
a focus on health.
And so is The Frozen Farmer,
and they have a farm.

09:42.782 --> 09:45.218
What do you want to do?
You've got three offers.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.554
Well, Mark...

09:47.554 --> 09:50.657
Yes, ma'am.
Would you come down to 15%?

09:52.258 --> 09:53.860
I'll meet you
in the middle -- 17%.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.863
You've got a deal. Done.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.798
Whoo!

09:58.798 --> 10:00.667
Congratulations.
Great presentation.
Thank you. Thank you.

10:00.667 --> 10:01.768
- Thank you so much.
- So good.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.204
Oh, my God.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.372
You're amazing. Thank you.
Oh! It was so nice
to meet you all.

10:06.372 --> 10:08.141
Congratulations.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.411
Yes!

10:12.912 --> 10:14.914
Mark Cuban has invested
in this space.

10:14.914 --> 10:17.250
He knows how to help brands
that are our stage in size.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.919
Like, he is going to be
such an asset

10:19.919 --> 10:21.421
to have on our team.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.592
Narrator: In Season 12,

10:25.592 --> 10:27.494
we watched Don Lessem
and Val Jones

10:27.494 --> 10:28.895
make a deal with Mark Cuban

10:28.895 --> 10:31.865
for their robotic
dinosaur company, Dino Don.

10:31.865 --> 10:32.966
We believe in you.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.302
Let's see
what they're up to now.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.504
Lessem: When we went
on "Shark Tank,"

10:37.504 --> 10:39.572
we had 150 robots.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.274
Now we have over 400.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.177
We have
not just dinosaurs --

10:44.177 --> 10:45.411
we have
Ice Age animals,

10:45.411 --> 10:48.114
we have giant dragons,
and we have huge bugs.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.049
Jones: Being on "Shark Tank"
really helped the business.

10:50.049 --> 10:52.685
Instead of us going out
and pounding on doors,

10:52.685 --> 10:54.320
now they're coming to us.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.489
Before "Shark Tank,"
we had four employees.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.726
With this influx of orders,
we've got 25 people

10:59.726 --> 11:02.295
working for us
and crews in four countries.

11:02.295 --> 11:06.299
We have dinosaurs in Finland,
England, France, Belgium,

11:06.299 --> 11:07.300
and now Germany.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.434
The year before "Shark Tank,"

11:08.434 --> 11:11.571
our annual revenues
were about $1.8 million.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.772
Following "Shark Tank,"

11:12.772 --> 11:16.709
we went instantly up
to $4.2 million in annual sales.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.711
The most important use
for us of Mark's money

11:18.711 --> 11:21.181
was to create our own
dinosaur touring show.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.650
Just imagine --
more than 60 giant dinosaurs

11:23.650 --> 11:25.251
parading through
the center of town

11:25.251 --> 11:27.253
before settling
in a park near you.

11:27.253 --> 11:28.521
We're building curiosity.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.256
We're building
interest for kids.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.158
The sky's the limit
for this business.

11:32.158 --> 11:34.794
Cuban: Working with Dino Don,
we've expanded the tours,

11:34.794 --> 11:35.995
got them to raise their prices

11:35.995 --> 11:37.530
because they were undercharging.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.166
The dinosaurs
keep on getting more amazing,

11:40.166 --> 11:42.902
which in turn draws bigger
crowds to the destinations --

11:42.902 --> 11:45.438
the zoos, the amphitheaters --
whatever it may be.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.574
And if we do it right,
we should hit $10 million

11:47.574 --> 11:49.075
over the next two years easily.

11:49.075 --> 11:54.414
Dino Don and Val are gonna be
household names globally.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.748
Egg.
It's a dinosaur egg.

11:55.748 --> 11:58.785
Oh!
Do you wanna sit on it
and see if it hatches?

11:58.785 --> 12:00.653
I don't consider
what I do a job.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.589
It's a bit of a mission.

12:02.589 --> 12:05.725
I want to spread the knowledge
of the real dinosaurs to kids.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.995
That sense of awe that makes you
wonder about all of nature.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.597
I know
I've done my job well

12:10.597 --> 12:14.367
when I see the smiles
and the awe on kids' faces.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.136
There's no more satisfaction
in life than that.

12:28.548 --> 12:29.749
Narrator:
Next up is a product

12:29.749 --> 12:32.352
to help you look your best online.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.727
Hi, Sharks.

12:40.727 --> 12:43.529
My name is Chloe,
and this is my partner Lan.

12:43.529 --> 12:45.832
And we are here
seeking $88,000

12:45.832 --> 12:48.401
for 22% equity
in our company.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.137
One of the things
that we've all learned in 2020

12:51.137 --> 12:52.972
is that people
from young to old

12:52.972 --> 12:57.010
are relying now more than ever
on technology to stay connected,

12:57.010 --> 12:59.212
whether it's creating
and sharing content

12:59.212 --> 13:01.147
or catching up
on a video call.

13:01.147 --> 13:05.251
And let's face it --
bad lighting is boring.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.854
So we know when it comes
to being seen...

13:07.854 --> 13:10.723
Lighting is everything!
...lighting is everything!

13:10.723 --> 13:12.525
Well, Sharks,
that's where we come in.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.461
Both:
Introducing Kawaii Lighting!

13:15.461 --> 13:16.796
We make professional lighting

13:16.796 --> 13:18.464
in all different
shapes and sizes

13:18.464 --> 13:20.633
that are simple to use,
cute to look at,

13:20.633 --> 13:21.868
and fit any mood.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.870
Want to spread the love
on your socials?

13:23.870 --> 13:26.606
Easy! Just use
our heart ring light.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.075
It really is love
at first light.

13:29.075 --> 13:33.246
Ready to look "purrfect"
on your next live video?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.048
How about right meow?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.283
With our cute
cat ring light.

13:37.283 --> 13:39.752
And when you're ready to be
the star of the show,

13:39.752 --> 13:44.223
simply use our star ring light
whenever, wherever.

13:44.223 --> 13:47.427
All you have to do is place...

13:47.427 --> 13:49.028
plug...

13:49.028 --> 13:50.797
pop in your phone...

13:52.498 --> 13:55.501
...and pose.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.370
One of the greatest features
about our lights

13:57.370 --> 13:59.405
is that they give you
kawaii eyes.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.941
That's right --
our customers absolutely love

14:01.941 --> 14:05.511
the cute reflections
of hearts, stars, and even cats

14:05.511 --> 14:08.214
right in their eyes.

14:08.214 --> 14:09.282
Kawaii Lighting loves

14:09.282 --> 14:11.117
making everyone look
and feel their best

14:11.117 --> 14:12.585
on and off camera.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.587
So who's ready
to shine the brightest

14:14.587 --> 14:16.856
and get kawaii lit with us?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.758
All right.
Wait, we'll actually
show you something

14:18.758 --> 14:20.059
that we've been developing,

14:20.059 --> 14:22.128
which is a carrying case
for our lights.

14:22.128 --> 14:24.597
That was the issue a lot
of our customers had was,

14:24.597 --> 14:26.165
"I love to travel
with my light.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.667
I'd like to bring it
on set."
Grede: Ah!
Cuban: That's cool.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.335
"I'd like to bring it
different places."
Greiner: Whoa.

14:29.335 --> 14:30.703
- So cute, too!
- And so, now, they can.
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.338
So this bag actually
holds the stand...

14:32.338 --> 14:34.040
That's a great idea.
Great idea.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.842
Thank you so much.
...and all the accessories.
Thank you so much.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.544
We designed it ourselves.
Greiner: So let's hear
a little bit about you guys,

14:38.544 --> 14:40.246
and what's your relationship
to each other?

14:40.246 --> 14:41.848
We met nine years ago

14:41.848 --> 14:43.783
at a Halloween party
in Chicago.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.284
We've been partners
ever since we met.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.754
So business and life. Yes.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.255
How did you
come up with this?

14:49.255 --> 14:52.091
I've always loved technology
since when I was little,

14:52.091 --> 14:54.594
and Chloe was
teaching dance in China

14:54.594 --> 14:56.496
right before
the pandemic hit.

14:56.496 --> 14:57.630
Yeah.
And I was like, "Okay."

14:57.630 --> 14:58.798
Wow.
Yeah.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.967
My other business
that I was doing at the time

15:00.967 --> 15:03.536
was manufacturing
licensed toys

15:03.536 --> 15:05.772
for one of the biggest
video games on the planet.

15:05.772 --> 15:08.441
And one of the things
that's really fascinating

15:08.441 --> 15:09.542
about Shenzhen, China,

15:09.542 --> 15:12.612
is it's one of the tech capitals
of the world.

15:12.612 --> 15:15.548
If you want to find new stuff,
that's the place to be.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.818
So, every weekend,
we would go to Hong Kong.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.953
We would go out
to the markets in Shenzhen

15:20.953 --> 15:22.688
and go trendspotting.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.157
What's new?
What's out there?

15:24.157 --> 15:26.225
What is something
that is exciting

15:26.225 --> 15:28.361
to bring back to the U. S.?

15:28.361 --> 15:29.929
All right.
And this is actually
what we found.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.064
What does it sell for?
What does it cost to make?

15:32.064 --> 15:33.833
Our heart ring light,

15:33.833 --> 15:35.234
which is our flagship
ring light,

15:35.234 --> 15:37.370
it sells for $305.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.738
Wow, that's pricey,
I think.
The big one.

15:38.738 --> 15:42.442
And it costs about $100
to make and land here.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.644
Hmm.
Grede: So, when did
you guys start this business,

15:44.644 --> 15:46.679
and what are
your sales to date?

15:46.679 --> 15:49.515
We started
a year ago, actually.

15:49.515 --> 15:51.250
Just a year ago.
So, our year-to-date sales

15:51.250 --> 15:53.186
are actually our
lifetime sales, as well.

15:53.186 --> 15:54.320
And they are how much?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.189
$261,000.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.356
Well, that's not bad
for this year.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.091
Grede: How many people
buy ring lights?

15:59.091 --> 16:00.660
Like, my makeup artist
has a ring light,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.261
and my sister
has a ring light.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.931
But, like, they're
the only people that
I know that have one,

16:04.931 --> 16:07.433
and I've never thought
about buying one.
Corcoran: You know what?
I have to differ with that.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.369
I've recommended ring lights
to everyone I know.

16:10.369 --> 16:11.704
And I say, "You don't have
a ring light,

16:11.704 --> 16:13.339
and you're on Zoom?!"

16:13.339 --> 16:15.374
COVID birthed
the ring light.

16:15.374 --> 16:16.676
It really did.

16:16.676 --> 16:17.910
What's your mode
of selling?

16:17.910 --> 16:21.214
So, we're selling direct
to consumer on our website.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.049
Only.
And you are not on Amazon.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.050
Is there a reason?
Both: No.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.852
We've actually
avoided Amazon

16:25.852 --> 16:28.087
because we didn't want
to create that competition

16:28.087 --> 16:29.088
by showing off.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.057
And so, we focused
on making sure

16:31.057 --> 16:32.592
our customer service
is the best

16:32.592 --> 16:33.893
that we can possibly be.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.228
We made relationships

16:35.228 --> 16:37.029
with celebrities
and influencers

16:37.029 --> 16:39.398
to make sure that
our brand was the one

16:39.398 --> 16:42.068
that was supported
by the people that were visible.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.604
Look, what you've done
is great, right?
Yes. Thank you.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.105
Just starting
and going to Shenzhen

16:46.105 --> 16:48.007
and putting all
the pieces together.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.809
Awesome. Brilliant.
Thank you.

16:49.809 --> 16:52.645
The reality, though,
is this is a hard business.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.547
There's always somebody
over your shoulder

16:54.547 --> 16:56.415
trying to do
the exact same thing.

16:56.415 --> 17:00.419
So, as an investor, I don't see
a direct path to scale.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.854
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.155
Thanks.
Thank you so much, Mark.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.624
But congrats
on what you've done.
Thank you.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.326
Do you have a design patent
on any of these?

17:07.326 --> 17:09.795
No.
No, we actually do not
have a design patent.

17:09.795 --> 17:12.899
Phase one of our business was,
let's prove the market.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.400
Are cute ring lights

17:14.400 --> 17:16.736
something that people
would even care about?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.704
So that was phase one,
and that's where we are now.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.139
Let me tell you
something, Lan --

17:20.139 --> 17:21.407
I love hearing that.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.676
You know, we hear entrepreneur
after entrepreneur

17:23.676 --> 17:25.111
spending the money
on a patent

17:25.111 --> 17:26.746
when they haven't
even discovered

17:26.746 --> 17:28.114
if a single person
wants to buy it.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.515
- Has any interest, yeah.
- Yeah.

17:29.515 --> 17:32.785
They reverse it, so it's so
refreshing to hear that.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.222
I'd like to offer you
$100,000 for 22%.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.224
That's more money
than you're asking for.
Cuban: There you go.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.126
And I'd like to get...

17:40.126 --> 17:42.361
Barbara, you know
how "Shark Tank" works?
...$10 a light
on the front end.

17:42.361 --> 17:44.330
$10 a light.
What do you call that thing?

17:44.330 --> 17:45.831
The $10?
Both: Royalty.

17:45.831 --> 17:48.734
A royalty -- a stupid royalty
that he's always talking about.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.070
But in this instance,
it makes sense -- $10.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.805
So I'm on
the same page with you,

17:52.805 --> 17:56.309
but I'm gonna overpay you
$100,000 for 22%.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.877
What do you say?
How long does that
royalty go?

17:57.877 --> 17:59.745
Greiner: Yeah.
It goes just until
I'm paid back.

17:59.745 --> 18:03.683
She just gets her capital back,
and then she keeps the 22%.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.084
Sure, but I don't want
to sit around

18:05.084 --> 18:06.986
and just, like,
be considered.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.056
Because I went over the price,
would you take my offer?

18:13.459 --> 18:15.761
I'm leaving this up to you.

18:15.761 --> 18:20.066
I think the $10 royalty
is...a lot.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.634
Cuban: He's right. Ooh.

18:21.634 --> 18:24.370
He's right.
There's gotta be a way

18:24.370 --> 18:26.839
where an investor
recoups their money

18:26.839 --> 18:28.941
rather than waiting till
the finish line five years out

18:28.941 --> 18:31.010
when you have
a big company to sell.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.945
And you know why it's --
O'Leary: I'll tell you what --
just to keep it interesting --

18:32.945 --> 18:34.780
Excuse me.
I don't need to hear from you.
I'm gonna make
an offer, Barbara.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.649
Excuse me, and why that's --
I'm not finished yet.
Just to keep it interesting.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.517
Do you want to hear my offer?
No, I don't want
to hear your offer.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.219
I know <i>you</i> don't.
Wait. Excuse me.

18:40.219 --> 18:42.688
Don't be so rude.
I want to say --
Do you want to hear
another offer?

18:42.688 --> 18:44.290
Do you know why
it's important that --
Greiner: Jump in, Kevin.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.691
It's the "Shark Tank".
O'Leary: Okay, great.

18:45.691 --> 18:46.692
No, Kevin --
Kevin, stop.
I'll tell you my offer.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.760
I will do the deal.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.528
Barbara, <i>silencio.</i>
How annoying.

18:49.528 --> 18:52.865
I'm sorry, I have to finish
my sentence at least, okay?

18:52.865 --> 18:54.467
Just at least
be a gentleman.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.802
The reason the investor
needs a means

18:56.802 --> 18:58.871
of getting the money back

18:58.871 --> 19:01.273
is you always want them
on the same page with you.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.042
So when you have the success
along the way,

19:03.042 --> 19:04.944
they're having the success
along the way.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.712
And then, when the big
payday comes,

19:06.712 --> 19:09.115
everybody celebrates
and loves each other.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.651
Now you can talk.
The way I would do this is,

19:11.651 --> 19:13.386
I actually like this idea,

19:13.386 --> 19:15.755
and I think I could help you
sell a lot of these.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.124
I'll do $88,000 for 22%.

19:18.124 --> 19:21.127
My royalty is $5
till I recoup my 88K.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.262
Hmm.

19:23.262 --> 19:26.632
The $5 royalty
also might be a little high.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.200
I just want to make it
a little bit easier for you

19:28.200 --> 19:29.368
and clear the field.

19:29.368 --> 19:31.270
I think what you do
is really cute,

19:31.270 --> 19:33.406
but it's just that for me --
it's just cute,

19:33.406 --> 19:35.141
and I don't think
I'm the right investor

19:35.141 --> 19:36.709
to help you do
what you really need to do.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.077
So for that reason,
I'm out.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.712
Bui: Thanks.
Thank you, Emma.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.447
Thank you.
All right, Lori,
what do you want to do?

19:41.447 --> 19:42.448
I think it's cute.

19:42.448 --> 19:43.783
I think you did a great job.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.484
Love you guys.
Thank you.

19:45.484 --> 19:49.088
I just have concern
about the marketplace...

19:49.088 --> 19:50.690
Understand.
...and the competition.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.725
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.026
Thank you so much, Lori. Awesome.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.895
Just to mess
with Mr. Wonderful

19:55.895 --> 19:57.563
I'm gonna drop
the royalty to $5,

19:57.563 --> 19:59.598
because I don't want
to see him get this. Okay.

19:59.598 --> 20:03.335
Well, I think
the opportunity...

20:03.335 --> 20:05.171
...is with Barbara.
Barbara, yes.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.639
Is that a yes?
That is a yes!

20:06.639 --> 20:08.507
Oh, that is a yes!
Cuban: Yay!

20:08.507 --> 20:10.976
Great!
Thank you so much,
Barbara!
Yay!

20:10.976 --> 20:12.812
I love it,
and I love you.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.980
We love our lights, too.
I'm so excited
to work with you!

20:14.980 --> 20:16.482
Yay!
Thank you!

20:16.482 --> 20:18.017
Thank you so much!
Thank you!

20:18.017 --> 20:19.351
Thank you so much.
Thank you for taking it.

20:19.351 --> 20:20.786
Oh, my God, thank you.
Thank you all for your time.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.221
- We really appreciate it.
- Congratulations, guys.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.389
Well done.
Greiner: Pleasure.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.324
- Thank you so much!
- We'll see you online.

20:25.324 --> 20:28.260
We did it!

20:28.260 --> 20:29.695
Mae: Oh, my God.

20:29.695 --> 20:32.565
That was the experience
of a lifetime, honestly.
Bui: Yeah.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.202
This moment means that
our dreams and our hard work --

20:36.202 --> 20:39.371
everything that we have just
been putting everything into

20:39.371 --> 20:42.141
for over a year
is really starting to realize.

20:42.141 --> 20:43.809
I think we really
have something,

20:43.809 --> 20:46.312
and we're so excited
to see where it's gonna go.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.424
Narrator: Next in the Tank
is a beverage

20:58.424 --> 21:01.327
that takes advantage
of a drought-tolerant plant.

21:10.903 --> 21:11.904
What's up, Sharks?

21:11.904 --> 21:13.439
I'm Kun.
And I'm Mo.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.640
And we're from Pricklee.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.543
And today, we're here
seeking $200,000

21:17.543 --> 21:21.013
in exchange for 5% equity
of our business.

21:21.013 --> 21:24.250
Who's ready for the next
big coconut water?

21:24.250 --> 21:26.418
Uh, said no one ever.

21:26.418 --> 21:28.554
Coconut water
is played out.

21:28.554 --> 21:29.922
Is it still 2005?

21:29.922 --> 21:31.490
Get out of here.

21:31.490 --> 21:34.460
Coconut water's time
has come and gone.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.196
Allow us to
humbly introduce you

21:37.196 --> 21:40.032
to Mother Nature's
ultimate thirst quencher.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.501
With just half the sugar
and half the calories

21:42.501 --> 21:44.470
of coconut water, meet...

21:44.470 --> 21:46.872
Pricklee cactus water!

21:46.872 --> 21:50.009
Pricklee has no carbonation.
No stevia.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.411
And dare we say it...
No coconut.

21:52.411 --> 21:55.714
No mo' coco! No mo' coco!

21:55.714 --> 21:59.785
"Cact-I" plus "cact-u"
equals "cact-us."

21:59.785 --> 22:01.587
So, who's ready
to make cactus...

22:01.587 --> 22:04.056
The new coconut?
...the new coconut?

22:04.056 --> 22:05.825
Right in front of you,
we have three samples

22:05.825 --> 22:07.760
of our delicious
cactus waters.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.995
Let's start with
the Prickly Pear original,

22:09.995 --> 22:12.198
with hints of watermelon
and bubblegum.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.403
Good.
Tastes to me like
a watered-down pear juice.

22:17.403 --> 22:19.138
The second flavor
that you have in your hand

22:19.138 --> 22:20.639
is the
Strawberry Hibiscus.

22:20.639 --> 22:21.640
This one's nice.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.742
And the last one
is the Mango Ginger.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.278
Oh, wow, very gingery.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.881
This is only 35 calories --
the whole thing?

22:28.881 --> 22:30.683
Both: For the whole can.
And how much sugar?

22:30.683 --> 22:31.684
Seven grams of sugar.

22:31.684 --> 22:32.852
All three of them
are great.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.653
Do you guys have
a ton of competition?

22:34.653 --> 22:36.188
Like, is cactus a thing?

22:36.188 --> 22:38.490
Cactus water
is a brand-new category.
Mm-hmm.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.860
There are a few companies
that are in that space, as well.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.795
Yang: But we have something
that others don't.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.297
So, growing up in Lebanon,
my grandma used to make it

22:45.297 --> 22:46.599
from the prickly pear.

22:46.599 --> 22:47.900
The actual pulp
that's in there,

22:47.900 --> 22:49.468
she used to juice that,
remove the seeds,

22:49.468 --> 22:51.136
remove the spines
from the outside,

22:51.136 --> 22:53.038
and we used to drink that
as kids growing up.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.940
I was in a local market
in Boston,

22:54.940 --> 22:57.710
and I just saw the prickly pears
out of the side of my eye.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.345
And I just had, like,
a moment of nostalgia.

22:59.345 --> 23:01.647
I just remember my grandma, how
she used to make this for us.

23:01.647 --> 23:02.948
So, just decided
right then and there,

23:02.948 --> 23:04.283
I'm gonna take it back home
and try to, like,

23:04.283 --> 23:05.918
replicate to the best
of my ability.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.787
So, you know, we took a sip,
and immediately, we just knew

23:08.787 --> 23:10.022
that this was
something special.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.457
Okay, guys.
You loved it.

23:11.457 --> 23:12.958
Many, many beverages
come into "Shark Tank" --
We -- Yeah.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.226
Many, many, many.
Yeah, absolutely.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.694
We've had,
over 13 years, many. Hundreds.

23:15.694 --> 23:18.664
Two questions that always
have to be answered.

23:18.664 --> 23:22.501
Distribution is next to
impossible to get shelf space.

23:22.501 --> 23:24.737
The weight of the can
direct to consumer

23:24.737 --> 23:26.205
makes it very expensive
to ship,

23:26.205 --> 23:27.573
so everybody has
a huge problem --

23:27.573 --> 23:29.008
customer acquisition.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.610
Now, you're gonna tell us you've
solved that problem, right?

23:31.610 --> 23:35.214
Because you guys want
a $4 million valuation. Yeah.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.583
Hopefully,
you've got some sales. Absolutely.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.351
We launched in February,
and we just had

23:39.351 --> 23:41.887
our best month
last month at $55,000.

23:41.887 --> 23:43.022
Where are you selling?
And this month --

23:43.022 --> 23:44.189
And this month,
we'll be at --

23:44.189 --> 23:45.457
This month, we'll be
at $70,000.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.426
So we're selling,
as far as retail distribution,

23:47.426 --> 23:49.595
UNFI and regional distributors
in the Northeast.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.996
So what does
one can cost, guys?

23:50.996 --> 23:52.097
And what does it
cost you to make?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.565
So, currently,
it costs us $1 to make,

23:53.565 --> 23:55.301
but we have a pathway
with our co-packer,

23:55.301 --> 23:56.635
as well
as our ingredient vendors,

23:56.635 --> 23:58.003
to get it down
to 65 cents.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.872
And that's landed,
including freight.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.640
We wholesale for $1.67.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.375
And they retail at $2.99.
Yeah.
Retail for $2.99.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.577
And in New York specifically,
it's more like $3.49. Yeah.

24:05.577 --> 24:07.680
How does that compare
to the cost of coconut water?

24:07.680 --> 24:09.515
Oh, it's right in line.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.317
Look, I'm a big
coconut water drinker,

24:11.317 --> 24:12.785
and the difference is,

24:12.785 --> 24:15.187
I get a whole lot more potassium. Sure.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.989
And I get a whole lot more
of the electrolytes.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.992
But your nutritional levels
are really, really low.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.827
The differentiator
is the antioxidants

24:21.827 --> 24:24.196
with the Prickly Pear
versus the coconut water.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.764
For example,
a single Prickly Pear

24:25.764 --> 24:28.600
contains more antioxidants
than a cup of green tea.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.202
It contains
all 24 betalains.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.904
It's got polyphenols, taurine,

24:31.904 --> 24:33.639
and, of course, a little bit
of vitamin C, as well.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.874
We anchor it to coconut water
because of the immense work

24:35.874 --> 24:37.042
that's done through
plant-based waters.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.744
Yeah, but you don't
say that anywhere.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.879
Right, so, the message is,
"Cactus is the new coconut,"

24:40.879 --> 24:42.481
because even though
99% of people

24:42.481 --> 24:44.717
know what cactuses are,
we have to give them something

24:44.717 --> 24:46.652
that they understand
the product with immediately.

24:46.652 --> 24:50.089
I love the fact
that it's coming from cactus.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.458
Most things take
a lot of water to grow.

24:52.458 --> 24:53.692
So I think you're
right on the money

24:53.692 --> 24:55.194
with something
that's important,

24:55.194 --> 24:57.296
but I think you're
a little bit too early.

24:57.296 --> 25:00.499
And so, I am out,
but I'll be watching you.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.001
Oh, thank you so much
for your time, Lori.
Thank you for your time.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.635
Yeah, guys, that's your
whole sales pitch.
Yang: Sure.

25:03.635 --> 25:05.504
Tastes great.
Doesn't use water.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.272
Low cost. Low cal.

25:07.272 --> 25:09.641
And, oh, by the way,
there's antioxidants.

25:09.641 --> 25:11.910
And you didn't
use it at all.

25:11.910 --> 25:14.179
You should repackage it
to something that has to do

25:14.179 --> 25:16.815
with saving the country
and the world from droughts.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.017
That's your missing piece.
So --

25:18.017 --> 25:19.551
And for those reasons,
I'm out.
Yeah, no.

25:19.551 --> 25:21.320
No, I-I agree from
a sustainability aspect.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.156
We need to maybe have focused
on that a little bit more.

25:24.156 --> 25:26.525
What we're trying to do from
the overall mission perspective

25:26.525 --> 25:28.694
is to really change
customer behavior

25:28.694 --> 25:30.662
and promote
sustainable foods.

25:30.662 --> 25:32.431
Guys, you know,
you've clearly got something

25:32.431 --> 25:34.533
that's, like, you know, interesting

25:34.533 --> 25:35.934
and doesn't seem
to be out there.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.336
But back to Mark's point,

25:37.336 --> 25:41.673
businesses now need to have
some kind of purpose, right?

25:41.673 --> 25:43.108
And you actually have that.

25:43.108 --> 25:45.411
You're just not telling us
that you've got it.

25:45.411 --> 25:47.212
And that's the biggest
miss here.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.181
I wish you the best of luck,
but I'm out.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.919
I have to say, I invested
in a chilled soda company

25:53.919 --> 25:56.422
going back
maybe 10, 11 years ago.

25:56.422 --> 25:59.158
It's where I lost
my first $200,000.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.559
Then they did
a round of investing.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.927
I lost another $200,000.

26:01.927 --> 26:03.295
Then another $200,000.

26:03.295 --> 26:06.999
And the reason it was lost
was the distribution kill.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.301
And I learned to respect
how dangerous it is.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.370
And so I don't want to go
down that road again.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.472
So I'm out.

26:13.472 --> 26:15.441
You know, what you're
specifically talking about

26:15.441 --> 26:17.342
is distribution
from a retail perspective.

26:17.342 --> 26:18.944
The other aspects, other
channels that we're exploring --

26:18.944 --> 26:20.646
Guys, they're all out.

26:20.646 --> 26:22.548
There's only one Shark left.

26:22.548 --> 26:24.950
So let me tell you
the way I see it, okay?

26:24.950 --> 26:29.154
I hate beverage deals because
of exactly what Barb said.

26:29.154 --> 26:32.491
We've seen them all before,
and they are just brutal.

26:32.491 --> 26:34.126
You guys are gonna have
a really hard time

26:34.126 --> 26:36.028
getting anybody
to return your call.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.996
However...

26:37.996 --> 26:39.198
I like this product.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.933
Wow!
I've never done
a beverage deal

26:40.933 --> 26:42.401
'cause I hate them so much.

26:42.401 --> 26:43.802
I hate you less.

26:43.802 --> 26:45.270
So I'm having
a hard time with it,

26:45.270 --> 26:48.240
'cause I know if I do this,
it's hell on Earth.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.008
But here's my offer.

26:50.008 --> 26:52.511
- It's a "Pricklee" offer...
- Pricklee offer.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.113
You might have
a little trouble with it.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.048
It might sting on the edges,
but it's the only offer

26:56.048 --> 26:58.450
I'm gonna make,
and I have no flexibility.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.220
I'll give you the $200,000
for 20%.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.021
That's it.
Take it or leave it.

27:03.021 --> 27:05.224
Don't tell me why your other
investors would be unhappy,

27:05.224 --> 27:06.425
Yadda-yadda-yadda,
woof-woof-woof.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.727
I don't care.
That's the deal.

27:08.727 --> 27:09.828
Thank you so much
for that offer.

27:09.828 --> 27:10.829
Can I ask you
a quick question?
Sure.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.164
So, just help us
understand --

27:12.164 --> 27:13.499
I mean, with your
immense experience.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.267
I mean, how are we supposed
to do that, right?

27:15.267 --> 27:17.069
As you know, this is
a cash-intensive business.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.904
That equity becomes
currency for us

27:18.904 --> 27:21.507
to raise additional money,
build our operations team,

27:21.507 --> 27:23.475
build our sales team
to get access

27:23.475 --> 27:24.576
into those Whole Foods,
into those Krogers.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.612
Oh, you're making me
regret this offer.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.313
I hate this business
so much. But...

27:28.313 --> 27:31.183
You know, if we were
to give you 20% of our equity,

27:31.183 --> 27:33.285
how are we gonna
return your money

27:33.285 --> 27:35.154
in, you know,
four or five years

27:35.154 --> 27:36.321
as an investment
partner, right?

27:36.321 --> 27:37.956
We want to honor the faith
that you've shown in us.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.057
The only way this works --

27:39.057 --> 27:40.859
and it's a --
it's a long shot --

27:40.859 --> 27:43.262
is you get it
to $50 million in sales.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.864
Just on the East Coast,
you can do that.

27:45.864 --> 27:47.432
And then, one of the big guys
take you out.

27:47.432 --> 27:48.867
That's what happens.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.302
You will never
return my cash...
It's not quite that easy.

27:50.302 --> 27:52.471
...till you get acquired.
We need that equity
to raise money

27:52.471 --> 27:55.040
to get to the $50 million
in sales that you want, right?

27:55.040 --> 27:57.543
Like, I just want
to set the stage --
Okay, and here's
my answer to that.

27:57.543 --> 27:58.877
If we do this deal,

27:58.877 --> 28:00.779
I'm gonna try
and get you more capital

28:00.779 --> 28:03.048
from very smart people
in distribution.

28:03.048 --> 28:05.617
It becomes part
of my "Shark Tank" family,

28:05.617 --> 28:07.386
and the whole team
goes to work on it.

28:07.386 --> 28:10.222
Of course. Of course.
But, Kun, he didn't answer
your question, did he?

28:10.222 --> 28:12.658
What -- What --
All I'm saying is,
this is, of course...

28:12.658 --> 28:14.259
Yeah, we're all gonna
get diluted together.
...it's not just
about cash, right?

28:14.259 --> 28:15.894
We're all gonna get
diluted together.
Why don't you counter him?

28:15.894 --> 28:17.596
You'll dilute even 1%.
Kun, do you really want
to get in bed with a guy

28:17.596 --> 28:20.199
who doesn't like your business,
doesn't believe in the business,

28:20.199 --> 28:22.634
and thinks it's
a nightmare?
Barbara, are you the one
that gave them the offer?

28:22.634 --> 28:25.037
No, I didn't, because
I don't like the business.
Oh, I forgot that --
you're out.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.205
He doesn't like
the business.
Are you still out?

28:26.205 --> 28:27.606
He's trying to come in
and gobble it up.

28:27.606 --> 28:28.974
Please?
Greiner: No,
but give him a counter.

28:28.974 --> 28:30.809
Listen, guys,
you don't have to do it.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.811
You don't have to do it.
You know, you guys wouldn't be
where you are without --

28:32.811 --> 28:35.147
I've said from the beginning.
I was honest with you.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.149
I said I had --
Barbara, silence, please.
He's where he is 'cause
he's a bully, by the way.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.451
Because he's a bully, he bullies
his way into these deals.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.119
Don't fall for it.
You know, I'm just
telling you the truth.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.589
It's so hard
that I need a big chunk

28:43.589 --> 28:45.457
'cause I know I'm gonna
get diluted multiple times

28:45.457 --> 28:46.692
as we raise more capital.

28:46.692 --> 28:48.627
But this deal
is not about --

28:48.627 --> 28:50.229
It's not about the cash.
It's not about cash, right?

28:50.229 --> 28:52.197
If we want cash,
we can get the cash, right?

28:52.197 --> 28:55.100
This deal for us is about
being first-generation Americans

28:55.100 --> 28:56.602
chasing the American dream

28:56.602 --> 28:58.637
and the sacrifice
that our parents put in.

28:58.637 --> 29:00.739
So would you consider
the original offer

29:00.739 --> 29:04.476
of $200,000 at 5%,
but as a line of credit?

29:04.476 --> 29:05.944
So we bring you
as an adviser,

29:05.944 --> 29:07.813
as somebody that can bring
a ton of value.

29:07.813 --> 29:09.514
We're giving you
investment back.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.450
But you have equity
in the business.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.686
No, I would go down to 10%,
but I want a royalty.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.688
I want some way
to get my cash back.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.056
You know what?
I love your heart in this.

29:18.056 --> 29:21.093
I would do that
for a line of credit.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.762
For 5%, of course, 'cause
I'd love to see you succeed.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.565
Even though I'd be a --
just sucker...
Not at all --

29:26.565 --> 29:28.400
...for going into
another deal like this.

29:29.334 --> 29:30.335
Do it.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.708
You have a deal.
You avoid getting a deal
with him, yeah.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.543
- Let's do this.
- Well done.
- Congrats, Barbara.

29:38.543 --> 29:40.679
Corcoran: This is exactly
the kind of deal I hate.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.581
Every piece of it.
Thank you so much.

29:42.581 --> 29:43.949
We're so excited
to work with you.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.050
But it's a compliment --

29:45.050 --> 29:46.551
it's a compliment
to the two of you,

29:46.551 --> 29:48.253
'cause I love
the two of you.
Both: Thank you.

29:48.253 --> 29:49.621
Congratulations, guys.
Both: Thank you so much.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.689
I'll be a customer, guys.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.224
Bye, guys! Good luck!

29:52.224 --> 29:53.759
Let's go!

29:53.759 --> 29:55.427
Yes!

29:55.427 --> 29:56.895
No mo' coco!

29:56.895 --> 29:59.665
Together:
No mo' coco! No mo' coco!

29:59.665 --> 30:01.333
We just really wanted
to protect our equity

30:01.333 --> 30:04.369
because we know how much money
it's gonna cost us to raise

30:04.369 --> 30:05.671
in order to grow
this business.

30:05.671 --> 30:07.506
And so, we want to make sure
that we're fair

30:07.506 --> 30:09.174
to, you know, Barbara

30:09.174 --> 30:11.176
and everyone else
that's believing in us.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.424
Narrator: Next up
is a homegrown business

30:25.424 --> 30:27.926
that is fashionable
and functional.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.469
Hi, Sharks!
My name is Mika Bertholdo.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.037
I'm from Dallas, Texas...
Yeah!

30:39.037 --> 30:41.440
...and I'm seeing $150,000

30:41.440 --> 30:43.942
for 10% equity in my company.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.446
Sharkettes, have you
ever been wearing

30:47.446 --> 30:49.981
one of those
"one size fits all" headbands

30:49.981 --> 30:52.784
that squeezes the bejesus
out of your head

30:52.784 --> 30:54.619
and then gives you
a throbbing headache?

30:54.619 --> 30:57.956
Look no further, Sharks,
'cause I've got you covered.

30:57.956 --> 31:01.860
Featuring ooakshell --
a one size truly fits all,

31:01.860 --> 31:03.995
fully adjustable,
hand-made headband

31:03.995 --> 31:06.131
that can be styled
countless of different ways.

31:06.131 --> 31:08.867
With our patent-pending design,
ooakshell allows you

31:08.867 --> 31:10.936
to adjust the tightness
to your comfort level

31:10.936 --> 31:13.171
using our signature rings.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.774
And creating
with your customized ooakshell

31:15.774 --> 31:17.843
has never been easier.

31:17.843 --> 31:20.946
Simply take the end
of your headband...

31:20.946 --> 31:24.883
and slip it through
these ooakshell rings.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.285
Want to go over and down.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.089
And that allows you
to adjust the tightness

31:31.089 --> 31:33.091
to your comfort level.

31:33.091 --> 31:34.726
Place it on your head,

31:34.726 --> 31:37.095
and then tighten it
until it feels comfy and cozy

31:37.095 --> 31:40.098
without any of
that unwanted tension.

31:40.098 --> 31:42.467
And if you need
a little bit of inspiration,

31:42.467 --> 31:45.270
take a look
at my lovely models.

31:45.270 --> 31:47.105
Corcoran: Oh, my God!

31:47.105 --> 31:50.142
I am now The Karate Kid.
You look cute like that.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.610
What are you doing
with the little tail?

31:51.610 --> 31:53.512
I'm so glad you asked.
Greiner: Yes.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.214
You tuck the tail
in the back,

31:56.214 --> 31:59.217
and from there,
you're good to go.

31:59.217 --> 32:01.420
Okay, good job.
Oh, you put the ring
in the front?

32:01.420 --> 32:03.321
You can do it
however you like.

32:03.321 --> 32:05.924
The possibilities
are truly endless.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.460
Want to switch up the style?

32:08.460 --> 32:09.928
Braid it, twist it, knot it!

32:09.928 --> 32:13.198
Gosh darn it, you can even
wear it as a facemask.

32:13.198 --> 32:17.602
Sharks, I'm crushing this,
and it's just little old me.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.571
And that's why I need
one of you on board

32:19.571 --> 32:22.207
so we can pound...these...out.

32:22.207 --> 32:23.675
So, tell me, Sharks --

32:23.675 --> 32:25.510
which one of you
wants to wrap your head

32:25.510 --> 32:29.080
around my headbands and bring
ooakshell to the world?

32:29.080 --> 32:31.082
Great job.
What does that sell for?

32:31.082 --> 32:33.718
The price is $35.

32:33.718 --> 32:35.187
And what does it cost
to make?

32:35.187 --> 32:36.621
$1.64.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.989
Ooh-la-la!
A low margin.
O'Leary: Oh!

32:37.989 --> 32:39.458
That's why
you're crushing it.
Thank you.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.793
- Love those margins.
- Tell us about you.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.663
I'm actually
a first-generation American,

32:44.663 --> 32:47.199
so my parents believed

32:47.199 --> 32:49.501
that education
was the most important.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.037
And my mom used to whisper
in my ear, like,

32:52.037 --> 32:54.973
"You're gonna be a doctor.
You're gonna be a doctor."

32:54.973 --> 32:57.509
And then, one day, I woke up,
and I was like,

32:57.509 --> 32:59.211
"I don't want
to be a doctor!"

32:59.211 --> 33:01.580
But, unfortunately,
I didn't realize

33:01.580 --> 33:03.548
that I didn't want
to be a doctor

33:03.548 --> 33:07.118
until about two quarters
before I graduated college,

33:07.118 --> 33:08.653
and I finished graduating

33:08.653 --> 33:10.922
with my Bachelor's of Science
in Biology.

33:10.922 --> 33:12.858
Where'd you go to school?
UCSD.

33:12.858 --> 33:15.327
That's where I met my husband --
my now husband.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.930
And we had a baby
and got married.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.999
And having a baby
is not cheap,

33:20.999 --> 33:22.667
especially when
you're a bartender.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.437
So I made the really
difficult decision

33:25.437 --> 33:26.938
to move back with my mom.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.807
With your husband?
With my husband.

33:28.807 --> 33:31.042
Wow.
And I was living
at home with my mom.

33:31.042 --> 33:33.445
After my second child,

33:33.445 --> 33:35.580
I was losing my hair.

33:35.580 --> 33:38.216
Like, not as bad
as Mr. Wonderful.

33:38.216 --> 33:40.585
Exactly the same
happened to me.

33:40.585 --> 33:42.988
Right?
Yeah, like, terrible,
terrible alopecia, mm-hmm.

33:42.988 --> 33:44.923
Postpartum hair loss so bad.

33:44.923 --> 33:47.559
I was so self-conscious, like,
when I put my hair up.

33:47.559 --> 33:51.096
So I knew that regular headbands
didn't work for me,

33:51.096 --> 33:53.331
because I have
a really large five-head.

33:53.331 --> 33:55.600
So I had to play around

33:55.600 --> 33:57.035
with a bunch
of different designs.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.639
I went to the fabric store,
spent a couple bucks on fabric,

34:00.639 --> 34:04.676
and I eventually came out with
this design that you see here.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.845
Because, so, for real,
are you crushing it?

34:06.845 --> 34:08.613
You said that, like --
Oh, I'm crushing it.

34:08.613 --> 34:09.915
Tell us about that.

34:09.915 --> 34:12.717
My first full year
of sales...

34:12.717 --> 34:16.454
$12,000!

34:16.454 --> 34:18.290
Okay, it's a start.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.824
Yay!
That's not that exciting.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.294
Well...
Come on, excite us.

34:22.294 --> 34:24.729
What year was that?
2019.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.064
I bet it gets better.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.499
- What happened in 2020?
- Then what happened?

34:27.499 --> 34:30.368
My 2020 sales are...

34:30.368 --> 34:32.871
$245,000.

34:32.871 --> 34:33.972
- Better.
- That's an improvement.

34:33.972 --> 34:36.341
Well, that's a nice bump
from $12,000.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.510
Yeah.
So, 2021 year to date.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.912
$386,000.

34:40.912 --> 34:42.547
So you had a nice rise.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.149
What were you doing
to get the sales?

34:44.149 --> 34:47.986
So, I am actually
doing everything 100% myself.

34:47.986 --> 34:49.688
I go buy the fabric.

34:49.688 --> 34:50.855
I cut it.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.257
I dye it.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.292
I sew it.
I package it.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.027
You do?
I do everything.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.529
Wow.
I'm the only employee.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.230
I don't have
any help with this.
Good for you!

34:59.230 --> 35:01.099
Then you're making some
big-time bucks, aren't you?
Good for you.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.434
So everything is, like...

35:02.434 --> 35:04.769
...in my pocket.
Just so people
understand, right?

35:04.769 --> 35:06.571
This costs you a buck --
what? --

35:06.571 --> 35:08.239
to make each one --
a buck 64.

35:08.239 --> 35:10.709
Yes.
And you're selling it
for 35 bucks.

35:10.709 --> 35:13.244
So your margins
are 90-plus percent... Yes.

35:13.244 --> 35:17.282
And you did $386,000
in sales.

35:17.282 --> 35:20.719
So you made a good $350,000
off of this that you put --

35:20.719 --> 35:23.054
There's no cost
of goods there, right?
Did you --
Or are you spending --

35:23.054 --> 35:24.723
Are you spending a ton
on marketing?

35:24.723 --> 35:26.725
No, I spend zero dollars
on marketing.

35:26.725 --> 35:27.926
How are you
selling it, then?
Well, how are you
selling it, then?

35:27.926 --> 35:29.761
How are you getting
your customers?

35:29.761 --> 35:32.764
I'm doing my own
social-media marketing.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.032
Like, it's --
Good.

35:34.032 --> 35:36.568
The biggest way that
I obtained my customers was,

35:36.568 --> 35:39.604
there's this bag company
that I was obsessed with,

35:39.604 --> 35:42.273
and so I would
take pictures of me

35:42.273 --> 35:44.542
with a bag and my headband,

35:44.542 --> 35:47.345
and I would wait for someone
to ask me where I got it from.

35:47.345 --> 35:49.080
Smart.
And if nobody asked me
where I got it from,

35:49.080 --> 35:50.582
I would be like --
message my friend like,

35:50.582 --> 35:52.117
"Hey, can you ask me
where my headband's from?"

35:52.117 --> 35:53.451
Like...
That's great.

35:53.451 --> 35:56.187
So that's how people started
finding out about me.

35:56.187 --> 35:58.123
And each one of these is unique,
is what you're saying, then.

35:58.123 --> 36:00.325
Yeah, everything is
one-of-a-kind, hand-painted.
Okay.

36:00.325 --> 36:01.726
The one on your head
is hand-painted.

36:01.726 --> 36:04.162
So, what if I wanted
to buy this one

36:04.162 --> 36:05.864
for me and
five people I know?

36:05.864 --> 36:07.165
Can't I duplicate it?
You can't.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.534
You can't buy it,
because I'm always sold out.

36:09.534 --> 36:11.603
That's why you can sell it
for $35, right?

36:11.603 --> 36:13.371
Because you say
"each one is unique."

36:13.371 --> 36:15.674
"Each one is unique."
And you probably have some
you've sold for more.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.777
Oh, my gosh, I have
a buy/sell/trade Facebook group,

36:18.777 --> 36:21.579
and one sold for $165.

36:21.579 --> 36:24.315
Why? Why was that?
Because it was
frickin' awesome.

36:26.117 --> 36:27.886
So, like, why do you
need a Shark?

36:27.886 --> 36:30.121
If you've got these
incredible margins...
Oh --

36:30.121 --> 36:32.524
...and you're literally, like,
doing all of this yourself --

36:32.524 --> 36:34.959
you've got, you know,
customers flooding to you,

36:34.959 --> 36:36.528
what do you need
the money for?

36:36.528 --> 36:37.929
I need the money because

36:37.929 --> 36:39.931
I'm, like, wiped out
just doing everything.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.133
I need help, you know,
with production.
Greiner:
Yeah.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.269
But why wouldn't you
just hire a few employees

36:44.269 --> 36:45.336
to help you with that?

36:45.336 --> 36:47.105
Well, my husband is
my unpaid intern.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.174
He helps me package.

36:49.174 --> 36:51.176
But his attention to detail
is like...

36:51.176 --> 36:53.311
Is your husband only
packaging your goods?

36:53.311 --> 36:55.547
Is he shipping them out?
Yeah, so, all he does

36:55.547 --> 36:58.483
is, like, fold it up in a
little, like, envelope pouch --

36:58.483 --> 37:00.151
And he can't even
do that well.

37:00.151 --> 37:01.986
What I'm saying is,
I get a lot of emails

37:01.986 --> 37:04.222
that's like,
"I ordered this and this,

37:04.222 --> 37:05.323
and I only got this."

37:05.323 --> 37:06.691
And I'm like, "Oh, no."
Okay, fair enough.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.526
I know that wasn't me.
Give the husband a break!

37:08.526 --> 37:09.728
I know that wasn't me.
It's like, I mean --

37:09.728 --> 37:11.162
Typical guy.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.698
But, Mika, something I'm trying
to get my arms around here --

37:13.698 --> 37:16.434
You did $386,000 in sales.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.403
You sell them
for about $35 each.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.638
That means you sold
10,000 of them.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.407
How do you make
10,000 of them?

37:22.407 --> 37:24.542
I just don't sleep.
For real, though?

37:24.542 --> 37:25.844
I'm seri--
I'm not even joking.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.245
I do everything.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.880
And where are you
selling them?

37:28.880 --> 37:30.081
On my website.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.050
You're 100%
direct to the consumer. Yes.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.452
Only through your website.
There's no wholesale. Nope.

37:34.452 --> 37:38.757
I'm also catering
to the same customers right now.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.326
You know, like,
the same 2,000 customers.

37:41.326 --> 37:43.762
My returning customer rate
right now is 81%.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.463
Oy-yoy-yoy!
Are you insane?!
What?!

37:45.463 --> 37:47.065
They just keep buying
and buying and buying.

37:47.065 --> 37:48.933
That's like a world record.

37:48.933 --> 37:51.002
Absolutely, I'm gonna
make you an offer.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.706
$150,000 for 20%
of your business.

37:55.673 --> 37:58.376
Greiner: Uh.
O'Leary: Your valuation
just got crushed.

37:59.377 --> 38:00.912
Better say yes.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.958
Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,

38:13.958 --> 38:15.360
and Emma seems interested

38:15.360 --> 38:18.463
in Mika's headband business, ooakshell.

38:18.463 --> 38:20.965
Absolutely, I'm gonna
make you an offer.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.636
$150,000 for 20%
of your business.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.405
Greiner: Uh.
O'Leary: Your valuation
just got crushed.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.707
Better say yes.

38:31.009 --> 38:33.111
Grede: You have a really
incredible product.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.746
You've obviously --
You know --

38:34.746 --> 38:36.114
I can see the reason

38:36.114 --> 38:38.950
that you would need a partner
to do this, because --

38:38.950 --> 38:41.352
Why are you crying?
Don't cry.
I'm, like, overwhelmed.

38:41.352 --> 38:43.988
Oh.
This is happy tears,
though, for sure.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.757
Oh, good. Like...

38:45.757 --> 38:47.659
I'm swallowing them.
Well, compose yourself.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.194
You're on the TV.
You don't want, you know --
They're gone. They're gone.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.595
No, none of that.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.931
I'm like, "They're gone!"
as they're falling down my face.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.033
- Do one of these.
- Your makeup is fine.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.602
Mr. Wonderful,
I'm borrowing your scarf.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.938
Aww, tell us --
why the gush?

38:59.938 --> 39:01.673
Oh, I'm just, like,
so happy that you're even

39:01.673 --> 39:05.109
considering offering
something to me, 'cause...

39:05.109 --> 39:07.645
I need help --
like, I can't sustain this.

39:07.645 --> 39:11.416
I work
like 18 to 20 hours a day,

39:11.416 --> 39:13.818
and I have kids
that I want to see sometimes.

39:13.818 --> 39:15.153
I get that.
A couple times, you know?

39:15.153 --> 39:17.388
She made 10,000 units
last year.

39:17.388 --> 39:19.157
Like, that's impossible.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.992
And honestly, it's really
not good for your marriage

39:20.992 --> 39:22.427
to have your husband
as your intern

39:22.427 --> 39:23.795
folding things of yours.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.630
Oh, this customer
got it wrong!
Absolutely.

39:25.630 --> 39:26.998
Maybe it's better.
It's a recipe for divorce.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.233
- You're right about that.
- Yeah.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.235
That's a disaster,
and that's coming from someone

39:30.235 --> 39:31.703
who actually works
with their husband.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.404
Okay.
Okay, so,
here's the thing.

39:33.404 --> 39:35.273
I think what you're doing
is incredible,

39:35.273 --> 39:38.810
and I honestly believe
that you are an actual artist.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.145
You can take
what you're doing in here

39:41.145 --> 39:43.081
and apply it to
so many different areas.

39:43.081 --> 39:44.616
I painted this.
I was gonna ask you.

39:44.616 --> 39:45.617
Wow.
I thought you did
the T-shirt.

39:45.617 --> 39:48.152
And it's a SKIMS Bodysuit.
No way!

39:48.152 --> 39:49.320
Yes!
Look at you!

39:49.320 --> 39:51.155
- I know!
- Good girl.
- I love that!

39:51.155 --> 39:52.523
Look at that
little collaboration

39:52.523 --> 39:53.625
you're thinking
about already.

39:53.625 --> 39:54.959
Smart, smart.
I like it.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.261
So here's the thing --
but I do think

39:56.261 --> 39:58.463
you're gonna need
an enormous amount of help.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.265
So I want you to think
about this a little bit,

40:00.265 --> 40:01.766
because, you know,
you've heard everybody

40:01.766 --> 40:03.701
say it before -- the value
that comes with a Shark.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.837
I really understand apparel.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.605
I really understand
direct to consumer.

40:07.605 --> 40:09.574
Both of my businesses
are completely rooted

40:09.574 --> 40:11.009
in the direct
to consumer space.

40:11.009 --> 40:13.811
But there's this whole
area of wholesale

40:13.811 --> 40:15.647
that you are
completely missing

40:15.647 --> 40:17.515
that actually
would be perfect.

40:17.515 --> 40:20.985
And I can really help you
unlock that very, very easily.

40:20.985 --> 40:23.021
On the infrastructure part,
there's a lot to do, right?

40:23.021 --> 40:25.056
'Cause we don't want you
dying in your house

40:25.056 --> 40:26.524
and sending out
packages anymore.

40:26.524 --> 40:29.227
That has to stop so you can
get back to being a mom.

40:29.227 --> 40:31.462
And I understand that, 'cause
I have two children myself.

40:31.462 --> 40:33.932
So $150,000 for 20%.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.967
10%, you don't wake up in
the morning thinking about it.

40:35.967 --> 40:37.669
20% of something
is meaningful.

40:37.669 --> 40:38.903
And I can really help you.

40:38.903 --> 40:40.438
So, what do you want
to do, Mika?
Yeah.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.408
Um...

40:43.408 --> 40:46.377
I do want to counter.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.346
Don't counter too hard.

40:48.346 --> 40:49.714
It's a good offer.

40:49.714 --> 40:50.815
Okay.

40:50.815 --> 40:54.052
So, this is Season 13
of "Shark Tank."

40:54.052 --> 40:55.653
13 is my lucky number.

40:55.653 --> 40:59.023
Would you do the deal
for 13%?

40:59.023 --> 41:00.091
No.

41:00.091 --> 41:01.659
I think that there is --

41:01.659 --> 41:04.162
you know, there's a part
of this that, you know --

41:04.162 --> 41:05.463
In your business,
you've been in business

41:05.463 --> 41:07.031
for a couple of years now,

41:07.031 --> 41:09.300
and there's an element
of naivetÃ©

41:09.300 --> 41:10.768
in terms of what it takes

41:10.768 --> 41:12.337
to really scale something,
right?

41:12.337 --> 41:14.872
You're wearing a bodysuit
that, you know,

41:14.872 --> 41:17.942
we sell hundreds of thousands
of every month.

41:17.942 --> 41:19.177
You want to scale
this business.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.179
You don't want to sell
10,000 units next year.

41:21.179 --> 41:22.447
You don't want to sell 20,000.

41:22.447 --> 41:24.882
You want to sell
50,000, 60,000 units,

41:24.882 --> 41:26.851
and that takes
some doing, right?

41:26.851 --> 41:29.053
It's not just, like,
you painting and seeing

41:29.053 --> 41:30.221
how much we can do.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.323
We're gonna actually try
to build a proper company.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.959
And so I'm gonna
actually stand firm.

41:34.959 --> 41:38.363
I'm gonna say
it's $150,000 for 20%.

41:40.264 --> 41:42.066
Okay.

41:42.066 --> 41:43.067
- Deal!
- Yes!

41:45.403 --> 41:46.871
Congratulations.
Oh, my God!

41:46.871 --> 41:47.939
Look at that!

41:47.939 --> 41:49.574
I'm gonna make 20
your new lucky number.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.409
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

41:51.409 --> 41:53.478
- Oh, that's so exciting!
- Thank you.

41:53.478 --> 41:54.746
I love it!
Thank you so much!

41:54.746 --> 41:55.780
Congratulations.
I can't wait!

41:55.780 --> 41:56.848
- Congrats.
- Congratulations, Mika.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.116
- Thank you guys so much!
- Thank you.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.717
Goodbye, Mika!

41:59.717 --> 42:01.085
How about that?

42:01.085 --> 42:02.720
Oh, my God!

42:03.988 --> 42:06.758
I got a deal with Emma!

42:06.758 --> 42:08.226
Oh, my God!

42:08.226 --> 42:10.028
Like, what the heck
just happened?

42:10.028 --> 42:12.230
I can't believe it.
I'm sweating and crying.

42:12.230 --> 42:13.965
And I'm so happy!

42:13.965 --> 42:15.433
Happy dance, happy dance!

42:15.433 --> 42:17.568
âª I'm so glad it happened! âª

42:17.568 --> 42:19.303
Oh, yeah, it's happening.
