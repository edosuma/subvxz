WEBVTT

02:11.087 --> 02:13.002
- Oh, the door.

02:13.045 --> 02:15.961
Uh, I just--
I don't want to offend you.

02:16.005 --> 02:18.007
- Ah, I'm--I'm holding
a hot cup of coffee

02:18.050 --> 02:22.533
and 20 pounds of books.
Offend me, please.

02:25.101 --> 02:27.321
Thank you.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.503
- Hey, sorry about
the door thing.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.853
It's just I was married
for nine years

02:37.896 --> 02:40.334
and then apparently
everything I did offended her.

02:40.377 --> 02:41.944
- She sounds
very difficult to please.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.468
- Yeah, my lawyer would agree.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.340
Well, can I make it up to you?

02:46.383 --> 02:48.516
Can I help you with--
maybe carry something?

02:48.559 --> 02:49.778
- I don't see why not.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.172
I only live
a couple of blocks down.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.651
What's the worst
that could happen?

02:53.695 --> 02:57.916
You steal a lot of books,
some nesting bowls, a robe.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.180
Here.
- All right.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.312
- Thank you.
It's not your size by the way.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.926
So, you like to shop, huh?

03:07.970 --> 03:11.365
You know my ex-wife actually--
no, we're not gonna do that.

03:11.408 --> 03:12.714
Uh, how--

03:12.757 --> 03:14.281
How's your latte, Sarah?

03:16.500 --> 03:20.330
It's on your cup.
Sarah with an H.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.636
- Right.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.899
It's actually Sara
without an H.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.206
But ya know after telling
the barista guy a dozen times

03:26.249 --> 03:27.729
and him not getting it,
I gave up.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.252
Because do you know what?

03:29.296 --> 03:31.646
Macchiatos still taste the same
with or without an H.

03:31.689 --> 03:34.257
- I thought I saw
you there before.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.999
- You noticed me?

03:37.042 --> 03:39.044
- I did.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.699
Did you notice me?

03:41.743 --> 03:45.964
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

03:46.008 --> 03:47.575
Hmm.

03:47.618 --> 03:50.578
Well, um, you know,
it was your smile actually,

03:50.621 --> 03:51.666
that I first noticed.

03:53.624 --> 03:56.714
I'm a--I'm an OBGYN,
so, I do see a lot of women.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.455
I'm just not usually
looking at their faces,

03:58.499 --> 04:00.414
which that sounds
super creepy.

04:00.457 --> 04:03.286
Can we just start over,
take this back?

04:03.330 --> 04:07.595
And I'll go open the door
for you the--right away.

04:07.638 --> 04:12.556
- That's okay, Doctor...Barry.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.820
- Without an H.
- Without an H.

04:22.436 --> 04:24.307
- So, tell me
just so I know for when I--

04:24.351 --> 04:28.442
when I do start dating again,
what was it that gave me away?

04:28.485 --> 04:30.226
Was it the awkward conversation?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.749
Or the failed attempt
at a compliment?

04:31.793 --> 04:34.970
Or just constantly referencing
my ex-wife?

04:35.013 --> 04:36.798
- I'm gonna go
with all of the above.

04:36.841 --> 04:39.366
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.455
Dating's going to be a lot
harder than I thought.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.500
- Dating is a nightmare.

04:43.544 --> 04:45.894
My friend Miranda says
that if I don't put myself

04:45.937 --> 04:47.287
back out there soon,

04:47.330 --> 04:49.463
I'm likely to snap
from extreme loneliness

04:49.506 --> 04:52.901
and start murdering
random men for sport.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.556
- I mean, who am I to judge,
you know?

04:55.599 --> 05:00.604
- This is me.
- Oh, wow, it's a nice place.

05:00.648 --> 05:03.128
- I don't usually
invite strangers in,

05:03.172 --> 05:07.263
but you seem nice and normalish.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.310
And I have a bottle of wine
in this bag that I can open.

05:10.353 --> 05:12.312
- Wine, wow.

05:14.705 --> 05:19.014
I don't know if I sh--sh--uh--
- Oh uh, yeah, okay.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.885
Well, I just, ya know,
I thought I would ask.

05:20.929 --> 05:23.192
And thanks so much
for your help.

05:23.235 --> 05:26.151
- Maybe, maybe later if you--

05:26.195 --> 05:27.283
That's how you'll stay single.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.872
That was amazing.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.353
That was so good.

05:53.396 --> 05:54.658
Wow.

05:54.702 --> 05:57.661
- Aw, thanks.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.663
You know I still have
that bottle of wine in here

05:59.707 --> 06:02.405
if you change your--
- On my way up.

06:12.546 --> 06:15.244
- You got this, Bar.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.644
It's interesting decorating.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.689
-Yeah,
I like weird things.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.345
- Lucky for me.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.439
Oh.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.922
You know, you have
an amazing voice.

06:40.965 --> 06:43.838
Do you ever
hope to share it?

06:45.927 --> 06:47.972
- No, no, no, no.

06:48.016 --> 06:50.105
Oh my God,
I can't even imagine like

06:50.148 --> 06:51.846
getting up in front
of a whole bunch of people

06:51.889 --> 06:53.238
and like just sing--oh!

06:53.282 --> 06:55.632
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, oh, oh.

06:55.676 --> 06:57.242
It's okay. It's okay.
- Oh, shoot.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.766
Ah, this is my favorite dress.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.376
I-I-I'll be right back.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.464
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.726
It's totally fine.
- Sorry.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.428
- Um, I do kinda
like these pants.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.865
Do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.565
Okay.

07:21.136 --> 07:25.140
Ah, you just made it worse,
Barry.

07:25.183 --> 07:30.014
You're such an idiot.
No wonder your wife left you.

07:45.421 --> 07:48.424
What the hell?

07:59.566 --> 08:03.395
Holy shit.
Holy shit.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.799
- What's the hurry, Bar?

08:15.843 --> 08:17.845
- Hey, we have
to call the cops, I found a--

08:17.888 --> 08:22.110
- Shit, I was hoping
to have a glass of wine first.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.681
Oh, hey.
This is my friend, Miranda.

08:27.724 --> 08:28.986
- Hi, Barry.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.248
Sara's told me
so much about you.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.685
It's nice to finally meet you.

08:31.728 --> 08:34.470
- Yeah, well, I met your
other friend in the shower.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.820
Only he wasn't
looking so good.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.692
Get out of my way,
both of you.

08:41.346 --> 08:44.175
- Oh, you're threatening us.
Oh, that's really good, Doc.

08:44.219 --> 08:46.047
- Yeah, we're in control,
Barry, not you.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.135
- There was something telling me

08:47.178 --> 08:48.658
that I shouldn't
have come in here.

08:48.702 --> 08:51.052
And I should've listened
to that voice, instead of yours.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.029
What is happening?

09:12.073 --> 09:15.555
- I can control you
any way that I want.

09:15.598 --> 09:18.079
You'd be surprised how many
men secretly crave that.

09:18.122 --> 09:19.820
Until I devour them.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.735
- What are you, a cannibal?

09:21.778 --> 09:25.173
- She's a siren, Barry.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.567
- A siren?
A siren?

09:27.610 --> 09:29.351
That was you singing,
not Sara?

09:29.394 --> 09:30.657
Okay, you two are crazy.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.354
- Oh Barry,
don't be so closed-minded.

09:32.397 --> 09:33.573
- What, you expect me to believe

09:33.616 --> 09:35.705
you're a mythical,
singing mermaid?

09:35.749 --> 09:37.272
- I'm not that type of siren.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.275
- Oh, oh, oh.
Can I womansplain it to him?

09:40.318 --> 09:42.930
Please?
- Go for it, Sara.

09:42.973 --> 09:45.759
-She's more of a
bird-like descendent

09:45.802 --> 09:49.066
from ancient Greek times.

09:54.115 --> 09:58.772
She seeks out those who take
delight in worldly pleasures.

10:03.777 --> 10:07.519
-For they will become
the devil's prey.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.132
-Nice dramatic ending,
Sara.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.568
-Aw, thanks.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.616
- So, you see,
we're not all half mermaids

10:16.659 --> 10:18.487
luring sailors in
for a good time.

10:18.530 --> 10:22.186
- Right, just a half-bird lady
whose friend lured a doctor in

10:22.230 --> 10:23.884
for a good time.

10:23.927 --> 10:26.321
Look, what is going on here?

10:26.364 --> 10:28.149
- We need you.
- Me?

10:28.192 --> 10:30.368
- Well, we needed a doctor.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.805
So, I followed you

10:31.848 --> 10:33.458
and Miranda seduced you
to come up here.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.460
- Oh, okay.
So, you're a stalker.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.681
And you're a man-eater.
Wow, how convenient.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.684
- I would've brought you
up here myself, but Sara,

10:41.728 --> 10:43.991
she plays damsel in distress
so much better than me.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.949
- Ah, no, no, no.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.995
Any woman could've brought
up this loser fish.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.779
I mean, you know,
he's just a pathetic,

10:49.823 --> 10:52.782
desperate divorcee
who hasn't been laid in years.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.176
That's a pretty accurate
picture, right, Barry?

10:55.219 --> 10:58.222
- We brought you up here
for a very specific reason.

10:58.266 --> 10:59.659
I need to die.

10:59.702 --> 11:01.399
- Die?

11:01.443 --> 11:02.966
Well, then jump out
of a window.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.228
Look, there's a window
right there.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.577
What do you need me for?

11:05.621 --> 11:07.971
- I need you
to perform an operation.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.713
I want you to swap
my voice box with Sara's,

11:10.757 --> 11:13.368
so that I'm no longer a siren.

11:13.411 --> 11:18.199
And then I can live out my life
just like any other mortal.

11:18.242 --> 11:21.855
- You wanna swap voice boxes?

11:21.898 --> 11:24.074
Okay, first of all,
not that kind of doctor.

11:24.118 --> 11:26.120
Second of all,
I'm not a fool.

11:26.163 --> 11:29.906
So, whatever you both are,
you are fucking nuts.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.227
- Ah!

11:46.270 --> 11:48.055
Okay, what is happening?

11:48.098 --> 11:50.753
- Will you do the operation?

11:50.797 --> 11:53.103
- I'm losing my mind.
- And I'm losing my patience.

11:53.147 --> 11:56.193
- Look, you don't want me
to do this kind of operation.

11:56.237 --> 11:59.109
I'm just a nervous,
twitchy gynecologist.

11:59.153 --> 12:02.330
- She can make you plunge
this dagger deep into your brain

12:02.373 --> 12:04.549
if you don't do what we ask you.

12:04.593 --> 12:07.030
Not like anyone's
gonna miss ya.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.860
- Okay, I'll do it.
- See, was that so hard?

12:10.904 --> 12:13.167
- Great.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.214
I've been thinking
about this ritual

12:17.258 --> 12:20.827
for a very long time.
- Yeah, I bet you have.

12:20.870 --> 12:23.786
Look, what you need
is an otologist.

12:23.830 --> 12:27.268
I just do pelvic exams
and routine pap smears.

12:27.311 --> 12:30.793
My expertise is in a very,
well, different

12:30.837 --> 12:32.142
part of the body.

12:32.186 --> 12:35.232
- I trust you more
with my neck.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.625
- But neither one of you
can trust me

12:36.668 --> 12:38.627
when you're under anesthesia.

12:38.670 --> 12:41.325
- Well, that's why you'll
put us out one at a time.

12:41.369 --> 12:44.067
- That way,
we can keep an eye on you.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.765
- See?

12:45.808 --> 12:47.854
Okay, so are there any
more questions?

12:47.897 --> 12:49.769
Because my expertise

12:49.812 --> 12:54.295
is with all the delicious
parts of a man's body.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.126
- If Miranda's not completely
full of shit,

12:59.169 --> 13:01.215
you could turn into some sort of

13:01.258 --> 13:04.696
maneating siren-bird thing.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.046
Is that really what you want?

13:06.089 --> 13:07.395
I can't believe you
just asked that.

13:07.438 --> 13:08.788
- Just shut the fuck up.

13:08.831 --> 13:12.269
Do what she tells you
and don't make her angry.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.618
- Don't worry.

13:13.662 --> 13:17.492
- All right, are we all set
and ready to go?

13:17.753 --> 13:20.321
- Miranda, look out!

13:42.299 --> 13:44.867
- If you would simply
do what I asked,

13:44.911 --> 13:48.610
I might consider
letting you live.

13:50.742 --> 13:55.486
Believe me when I say,
I am done being a man-eater.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.880
And Sara here
wants to be a siren.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.534
- Have you ever been
ghosted, Barry?

13:59.577 --> 14:03.364
Been told you'd be really cute
if you just lost a few pounds?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.322
I'm gonna be able to sing...

14:05.366 --> 14:08.630
and have any man,
anywhere come running.

14:08.673 --> 14:11.763
And then I get everything
I want after

14:11.807 --> 14:13.548
for an eternity.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.811
Holy shit, could you think
of anything better?

14:15.855 --> 14:20.381
- Yes, leaving.
This is fucking insane.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.602
Insane enough to cause
you to plunge that dagger

14:24.646 --> 14:27.257
right through your brain?

14:27.301 --> 14:30.304
While Sara writes
your suicide note

14:30.347 --> 14:33.829
tracing your own signature

14:33.873 --> 14:36.919
off that coffee shop receipt?

14:36.963 --> 14:40.140
- You're sick.

14:42.185 --> 14:45.406
- You're the doctor
who's gonna cure me.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.601
- Don't even think
about it, Bar.

15:06.644 --> 15:09.952
I want this as much as she does.
Maybe even more.

15:09.996 --> 15:11.432
So, don't think
I won't take you out

15:11.475 --> 15:12.912
if something happens to her.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.305
- Look, my day started
with a refreshing drink

15:15.349 --> 15:16.741
and a pleasant walk.

15:16.785 --> 15:19.353
And I am now contemplating
murdering a siren.

15:19.396 --> 15:22.182
Cut me a little slack, Sar.

16:36.560 --> 16:42.218
- Oh okay, you are alive.
That's good, I hope.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.438
Oh, oh, no, no, I would
maybe wait a little bit

16:44.481 --> 16:46.266
before you try to speak.

16:46.309 --> 16:50.226
- Aaaaah.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.793
I sound horrible.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.492
Thank you, Barry.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.451
I'm really sorry
I put you through all of this.

16:57.494 --> 17:00.367
I just really wanted
to live a normal life.

17:02.195 --> 17:06.851
Please forgive me.
I didn't know what else to do.

17:11.073 --> 17:16.513
- Sara, you sound amazing
like a true siren.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.134
- You'll never
forget your first.

18:32.023 --> 18:34.330
How did you do that?

18:34.374 --> 18:36.985
- This was the only way.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.770
This dagger's been dipped
in the blood of a former victim.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.337
- You saved my life.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.905
- I told you if you did
what I asked, I'll let you live.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.212
- Actually, you said
you might let me live.

18:46.255 --> 18:50.520
I remember that "might"
quite distinctly.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.962
- Barry, I really am sorry.

18:58.006 --> 18:59.834
I never wanted to live
a selfish life

18:59.877 --> 19:02.358
full of greed and gluttony.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.926
I had no choice.

19:04.969 --> 19:07.233
I can't say the same
for Sara, though.

19:07.276 --> 19:11.672
- Yeah, she had her issues.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.686
- Well I--I must admit,

19:25.729 --> 19:28.471
I'm pretty excited
about my new, mortal life.

19:28.515 --> 19:30.212
I'm thinking of
becoming a vegetarian.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.432
- Oh yeah, there's a great
vegan place around the corner.

19:32.475 --> 19:35.652
- Oh well, it's a date.
- A date?

19:35.696 --> 19:37.132
- Yeah, why not?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.742
I mean after you
getting to know me

19:38.786 --> 19:39.787
and me getting to know you.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.223
- Me operating on you.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.095
You killing a
supernatural being.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.273
See, we bonded for life.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.927
Well, as long as you're okay
with dating a much older woman.

19:49.971 --> 19:51.538
- Wait, how much older?

19:51.581 --> 19:54.193
- Um, I stopped counting
after like 500 years.

19:55.803 --> 19:59.850
- After you.
- Oh, such a gentleman.

21:24.195 --> 21:26.285
- Bring out your heads.

21:26.328 --> 21:30.506
Attention citizens!
Bring out your heads!

21:43.998 --> 21:46.566
Hey, you.
Go back.

21:46.609 --> 21:47.871
You're in the red zone.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.873
- I'm on my way
to Celestial Falls.

21:49.917 --> 21:53.660
- Well, we just come from there.
I'm sorry to say,

21:53.703 --> 21:55.705
the devil beat ya to it.

22:10.416 --> 22:13.157
- Let's go, come on.

22:14.811 --> 22:16.422
-The plague came
without warning,

22:16.465 --> 22:19.120
placing humanity itself
on trial.

22:19.163 --> 22:20.469
It came for those we love

22:20.513 --> 22:22.558
and those we hate
in equal measure.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.604
The relative and the stranger,

22:24.647 --> 22:27.171
the prophet and the pauper.

22:27.215 --> 22:30.131
Theologians believed the
gates of hell had collapsed

22:30.174 --> 22:32.829
unleashing its demons
upon the earth.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.092
It is the mission
of a sacred few,

22:35.136 --> 22:36.833
those with proven immunity

22:36.877 --> 22:39.836
to identify the contagion
before it spreads.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.970
They've been called
humanity's last hope.

22:43.013 --> 22:46.626
They are the meter readers.

23:00.814 --> 23:02.946
Dalton.

23:05.514 --> 23:09.910
-Mrs. Jones?

23:16.395 --> 23:17.526
- Thanks for coming, Father.

23:27.057 --> 23:29.843
Can I fix you
something to eat?

23:32.976 --> 23:35.065
- No thanks.

23:35.109 --> 23:38.025
I'm on a schedule.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.551
Is this Mercy?

23:42.595 --> 23:46.425
- Yes, Father.
- I'm not a priest.

23:48.035 --> 23:51.517
Let's get started.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.781
I'd like to review
some of her symptoms.

23:54.824 --> 23:56.043
- Well, she ain't been herself

23:56.086 --> 23:57.610
if that's what
you're gettin' at.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.481
She spits at me

23:59.525 --> 24:01.701
and talks in words
I don't understand.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.530
- In a language
she's never studied?

24:04.573 --> 24:07.489
- Yes, Father.
Sir.

24:07.533 --> 24:10.579
Can you help her?

24:10.623 --> 24:15.802
- I'll need to administer a test
before final determination.

24:15.845 --> 24:18.239
Let's just pray

24:18.282 --> 24:21.851
she hasn't entered
the final stage.

24:21.895 --> 24:24.332
Where is she?

24:24.375 --> 24:27.248
- Back there.

24:42.742 --> 24:46.572
- Mercy, my name is Dalton.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.577
- Please help me.
- That's why I'm here.

24:55.276 --> 24:58.932
How are you feeling today?

24:58.975 --> 25:01.674
- Afraid.

25:01.717 --> 25:04.546
- Not of me, I hope.

25:04.590 --> 25:08.594
- No.
You have kind eyes.

25:09.943 --> 25:13.947
- Who are you afraid of?

25:16.166 --> 25:19.605
If you can identify
the intruder...

25:20.823 --> 25:25.436
I might be able
to make him go away.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.830
- It doesn't like
to say its name.

25:29.789 --> 25:34.533
- No, they usually don't.

25:36.709 --> 25:39.973
- What's that?
- It's a mirror.

25:40.016 --> 25:44.325
It'll help me find
what's ailing you.

25:55.641 --> 25:59.035
- Demon, I command thee
in the name of God!

25:59.079 --> 26:01.603
I cast thee out!

26:08.828 --> 26:11.004
-Uh!

26:12.571 --> 26:15.791
- Uh!

26:20.100 --> 26:21.275
-In the name
of the Holy,

26:21.318 --> 26:23.756
leave this mortal vessel.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.431
-Let's look at
the numbers.

26:47.475 --> 26:51.566
-I have.
- Very good,

26:51.610 --> 26:53.394
And where is that?
-And the world's--

26:53.437 --> 26:55.657
- Hawaii.
- Excellent.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.528
Maybe we can go there one day.

26:57.572 --> 26:58.573
Would you like that?

26:58.617 --> 27:00.444
- Mm-hmm.
- Me, too.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.405
It would be nice.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.320
Well, we need to fill-in up here
and it looks like

27:06.363 --> 27:09.671
you've got green pieces.
What do you think?

27:09.715 --> 27:10.846
-We're going bonkers
because you're suggesting

27:10.890 --> 27:12.718
this is some sort of
mental virus.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.284
Let's look at the numbers.
-I have.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.809
-Then you know
the world has been overrun.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.333
I mean, come on.
When a patient moves past

27:19.376 --> 27:20.856
the point of expulsion--

27:20.900 --> 27:22.684
-By expulsion I take it
you mean an exorcism.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.077
-Well, call it
what you'd like.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.209
But all I know
is that when expulsion fails,

27:26.253 --> 27:27.820
the only known
method of containment--

27:27.863 --> 27:30.213
the only known method
is decapitation.

27:30.257 --> 27:32.302
-To preserve their
immortal soul?

27:32.346 --> 27:35.610
-If that makes you sleep
at night, yes.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.226
- Yes, now that's a picture.

27:47.317 --> 27:50.494
Got it?
Yeah, all right.

27:50.538 --> 27:51.931
- Pete Roseman says
we'll be going

27:51.974 --> 27:52.888
back to school in the fall.

27:52.932 --> 27:54.324
- Without a doubt.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.109
Everything will be back
to normal by then.

27:56.152 --> 27:57.937
- That's wishful thinking,
Mikey.

27:57.980 --> 28:00.504
Nothing's coming back,
not until this passes.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.985
- It is passing.
Maybe you haven't heard.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.074
Some of the salons
are opening up next week.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.510
- Because that's essential?

28:06.554 --> 28:09.339
- Well, yeah, it is to me.
I mean, look at this.

28:09.383 --> 28:11.254
Come on, guys.
Let's set the table.

28:11.298 --> 28:12.560
Your father will
be wanting his supper

28:12.603 --> 28:13.953
when he gets home.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.998
- We haven't heard
from him in days.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.871
- Well, the storm has
knocked out a lot of the towers.

28:18.914 --> 28:21.134
- We still have power.
- Yeah, thank goodness, right?

28:21.177 --> 28:23.310
Never look a gift horse
in the mouth.

28:23.353 --> 28:24.790
Your father will message us
when he can.

28:24.833 --> 28:28.184
- Well, what if he can't?

28:28.228 --> 28:29.708
I just saw the report
from Celestial Falls.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.058
The infection rate
is off the chart.

28:34.060 --> 28:38.064
Go wash up, Michael.
I-I'll get that.

28:40.327 --> 28:41.850
I wish you would
watch what you say

28:41.894 --> 28:43.852
in front of your brother.
- Why?

28:43.896 --> 28:46.202
Shouldn't he know the truth?
- What truth, Theresa?

28:46.246 --> 28:48.248
- That daddy might not
be coming home.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.424
- Maybe you forgot.
Your father has immunity.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.208
- I didn't forget.

28:52.252 --> 28:55.429
Immunity needs to be
reevaluated every 72 hours.

28:55.472 --> 28:56.778
He could be dead, mother.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.737
Or worse.
What if he's turned?

28:58.780 --> 29:02.088
- Stop saying that.
- It's been three days.

29:02.131 --> 29:06.440
If he's not back by 7 o'clock,
you know we can't let him in.

29:10.574 --> 29:14.535
- Uh, ah.

29:14.578 --> 29:16.058
He'll be back by then,
all right?

29:16.102 --> 29:18.278
You'll see.

30:11.070 --> 30:14.160
- He's here, he's here.
Daddy's home.

30:14.203 --> 30:16.727
- Michael, wait.
It's too late.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.470
-Open up.

30:20.514 --> 30:21.820
- Open the door,
that's your father.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.952
- We don't know that.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.563
-I'm all right,
let me in.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.523
- Daddy, we can't.

30:29.566 --> 30:32.395
You gave us direct orders
not to let you in after 7.

30:32.439 --> 30:35.703
- I am giving the orders now.
Get away from the door.

30:39.881 --> 30:42.536
-Let me in, trust me.

30:42.579 --> 30:46.932
- If you let him in,
I swear, I'll chop his head off.

30:46.975 --> 30:48.934
- You--you'll what?
- You heard me.

30:48.977 --> 30:51.371
I swear I'll do it.
-Trust me.

30:51.414 --> 30:54.983
- He could die out there.
- Or we could die in here.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.724
-Let me in.
- Michael, just go to your room.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.160
- But Mom--
- Go!

30:58.204 --> 30:59.858
- I hate you!
-Let me in.

31:02.991 --> 31:07.430
-Trust me.

31:07.474 --> 31:09.693
Let me in.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.870
- Dalton, honey.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.872
We need to
get you retested, okay?

31:13.915 --> 31:15.699
Just spend the night
in the cellar

31:15.743 --> 31:17.919
and we'll bring the doctor
first thing in the morning

31:17.963 --> 31:20.443
to take a good, long look.

31:20.487 --> 31:22.837
Okay, honey?

31:25.187 --> 31:28.582
-Why won't you
let me in? Please.

31:28.625 --> 31:34.022
- [footsteps receding

32:30.078 --> 32:31.166
When the first wave hit,

32:31.210 --> 32:33.081
the world wasn't ready
to believe.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.823
They called it a hoax,
a mass hallucination.

32:35.866 --> 32:38.652
But the truth
became impossible to ignore.

32:38.695 --> 32:42.351
Entire families were infected.
Including our own.

32:42.395 --> 32:47.269
My baby sister, Madeline,
was the first to show signs.

32:47.313 --> 32:50.142
My father did
what was necessary.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.666
The meter was designed
by holy disciples

32:52.709 --> 32:55.669
and used to identify
the forces of darkness.

32:55.712 --> 32:58.106
Its powers of detection
came from the meter reader,

32:58.150 --> 33:00.413
not from the instrument itself.

33:00.456 --> 33:03.416
Less than 10% of the population
has this gift.

33:03.459 --> 33:04.852
Some call them saints,

33:04.895 --> 33:06.810
but my father doesn't
buy all that.

33:06.854 --> 33:08.508
He says they're
just regular Joes

33:08.551 --> 33:11.250
doing the work of heroes.

33:11.293 --> 33:15.645
- Don't go, please.

33:15.689 --> 33:18.344
- I don't have a choice.

33:18.387 --> 33:21.912
This is bigger than us.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.482
- Come on, honey.

33:29.094 --> 33:32.619
- Trust no one.
Not even me.

33:32.662 --> 33:36.884
Remember, the devil
is the master of lies.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.610
- Mom?

34:17.620 --> 34:18.665
Dad?

34:38.815 --> 34:41.122
-Trust no one.

34:43.559 --> 34:45.474
- No!

35:13.023 --> 35:15.025
- What are you doing?

35:15.069 --> 35:17.637
- What's it look like, dumplin'?

35:17.680 --> 35:20.727
Check the fridge for some
come back sauce, would ya?

35:20.770 --> 35:24.600
All that traveling
Your father's gonna be famished.

35:24.644 --> 35:27.603
- You can't go down there.
- Yeah, I know that, honey.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.605
I'm just gonna leave a tray
by the cellar door.

35:29.649 --> 35:31.259
- Not if he's reached
the final stage.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.043
He'll be hungry, yeah,
but not for your

35:33.087 --> 35:36.612
fried green tomatoes.
Those things eat human beings.

35:36.656 --> 35:40.616
They devour entire families
starting with their own.

35:40.660 --> 35:44.142
- Hush, baby, you're confused.
No, he's--he's not a thing.

35:44.185 --> 35:48.015
He's your father and my husband.
- You can't go down there.

35:48.058 --> 35:49.495
- Michael.

35:53.499 --> 35:57.677
- No, no.
No, Michael.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.507
Michael, oh my God, Michael!
Dalton, give him back!

36:01.550 --> 36:06.207
Give me back our son, Dalton!
Oh my God, no.

36:07.643 --> 36:11.081
Theresa, Theresa,
Theresa, where are you going?

36:11.125 --> 36:12.257
Oh my God, where are you?

36:12.300 --> 36:13.606
You can't do this.
You can't do this.

36:13.649 --> 36:15.608
Okay, listen.
Listen to me, Theresa.

36:15.651 --> 36:19.612
We have to do
something together, okay?

36:19.655 --> 36:21.483
Theresa, what are you gonna do?
- What he taught me to do.

36:21.527 --> 36:22.528
- No.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.973
Everything's gonna be just fine.

36:33.016 --> 36:35.062
You'll see.

36:58.868 --> 37:02.089
- Remember, the devil
is the master of lies.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.810
- Lord,
grant me strength in this.

37:27.854 --> 37:30.465
My family's darkest hour.

37:43.739 --> 37:49.179
- Mom, Dad?
Mikey?

38:23.170 --> 38:26.608
- In the name of God, demon,
I command you,

38:26.652 --> 38:29.132
reveal yourself.

38:31.309 --> 38:35.182
Michael.
Where's Mom and Dad?

38:59.380 --> 39:02.644
- They. Were. Hungry.

39:06.169 --> 39:11.131
- Oh, God, Daddy.
- Three days, the delay

39:11.174 --> 39:15.222
has cost me.
It cost me dearly.

39:15.265 --> 39:17.790
- Dad, just--just don't move.
I'll get you out of here.

39:17.833 --> 39:23.361
- No, there's no time.
They're not like us.

39:23.404 --> 39:27.190
Michael, your mom...

39:27.234 --> 39:29.367
I couldn't save them.

39:29.410 --> 39:33.762
They're carriers.
They're like Madeline.

39:33.806 --> 39:37.984
Sweet, sweet Maddy.

39:41.770 --> 39:46.688
You know what to do.
- I can't. I can't.

39:46.732 --> 39:49.778
- You have to.

39:49.822 --> 39:53.434
This is bigger than us.

39:56.132 --> 39:57.046
- Mikey?

40:08.797 --> 40:11.409
- Mikey?

40:15.369 --> 40:20.374
Ah, my dumplin'.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.377
The salons are open in hell.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.684
How do you like my nails?

40:27.468 --> 40:31.777
Come, come look.

40:34.954 --> 40:38.827
- Mom.
- Take a good look, honey.

40:55.583 --> 41:07.769
- Lord have mercy on my soul.

41:17.518 --> 41:19.085
- That's my girl.

41:51.421 --> 41:53.380
- Bring out your heads!

41:53.423 --> 41:54.816
Attention, Citizens!

41:54.860 --> 41:56.949
Bring out your heads!

42:21.539 --> 42:24.237
-As the crisis surges
across the global community,

42:24.280 --> 42:25.804
the debate between
science and religion

42:25.847 --> 42:27.545
has been rendered moot.

42:27.588 --> 42:29.895
Whatever side you fall on,
whether you consider

42:29.938 --> 42:33.420
this scourge a disease
or a spiritual comeuppance,

42:33.463 --> 42:36.292
there seems to be little debate
that the tracing

42:36.336 --> 42:39.731
and containing the spread
is our number one priority.

42:39.774 --> 42:42.516
In local news, Castle County
is reporting a disturbing

42:42.560 --> 42:46.607
new spike in cases.
Officials strongly urge

42:46.651 --> 42:49.915
those with immunity
to join the fight.

42:49.958 --> 42:51.264
The world needs you...

42:51.307 --> 42:53.396
now more than ever.

43:03.972 --> 43:05.191
-My father used to say

43:05.234 --> 43:07.149
that what he did
was a public service.

43:07.193 --> 43:10.022
And that someday history
will sanctify our duties.

43:10.065 --> 43:11.763
Just regular Joes, he'd say,

43:11.806 --> 43:13.852
doing the work of heroes.

43:13.895 --> 43:17.029
I guess that makes me
a regular Josephine.

43:17.072 --> 43:19.858
Either way,
my work is just beginning.
