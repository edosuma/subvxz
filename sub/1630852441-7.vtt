00:14.708 --> 00:15.625
Come on!

00:16.208 --> 00:20.375
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-The party's just begun</i>

00:20.458 --> 00:23.916
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-Maths is so much fun</i>

00:24.000 --> 00:24.833
All right!

00:24.916 --> 00:27.041
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-Everyone</i>

00:27.125 --> 00:29.291
<i>-Party!</i>
<i>-Maths is fun</i>

00:29.375 --> 00:30.625
<i>We're the babies</i>

00:30.708 --> 00:32.083
<i>You're the big kids</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:35.416
<i>Teach us all the maths you know</i>
<i>One, two, three, let's go</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:36.333
<i>Zu ba!</i>

00:36.416 --> 00:37.750
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:37.833 --> 00:39.833
<i>The party's just begun</i>

00:39.916 --> 00:45.208
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-This party's number one!</i>

00:45.291 --> 00:47.041
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:54.958 --> 00:57.583
<i>The babies are in the playroom today.</i>

00:57.666 --> 00:59.416
<i>Bailey is drawing a castle.</i>

01:02.916 --> 01:04.750
Nice castle, Bailey.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.666
Thanks, Kip.

01:07.541 --> 01:10.041
The secret ingredient was love.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.333
And crayons.

01:15.416 --> 01:16.250
Tilly?

01:17.375 --> 01:20.125
You look sad. Are you sad?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.291
<i>Shì.</i>

01:22.375 --> 01:27.250
She's sad because I don't want
to share Raffe, my special toy, with her.

01:27.333 --> 01:30.125
What can we do to make you feel better?

01:39.083 --> 01:41.250
You want to stomp your feet?

01:41.333 --> 01:43.958
She wants to do the Tilly dance!

01:44.041 --> 01:47.750
-Oh yeah! Let's do it! Come on!
-Come on!

01:47.833 --> 01:48.875
I dance too!

01:48.958 --> 01:53.041
I'll be right back, Raffe. Wait for Lulu!

01:55.541 --> 01:57.666
<i>Let's do Tilly's pattern dance</i>

01:57.750 --> 02:00.041
<i>-It's such a fun dance to do</i>
-Yeah!

02:00.125 --> 02:02.041
<i>We'll follow Tilly's pattern</i>

02:02.125 --> 02:04.208
<i>You can do it too</i>

02:04.291 --> 02:05.875
And it goes like this!

02:06.375 --> 02:08.541
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

02:08.625 --> 02:11.000
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

02:11.083 --> 02:13.041
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

02:13.125 --> 02:15.500
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

02:15.583 --> 02:17.875
<i>Can we change it a little?</i>
<i>Put a hop in the middle?</i>

02:17.958 --> 02:19.875
<i>Spin around and pretend to climb?</i>

02:19.958 --> 02:22.583
<i>But that's not Tilly's pattern</i>

02:22.666 --> 02:26.625
<i>A pattern does the same thing every time</i>

02:27.291 --> 02:28.791
Here we go!

02:29.375 --> 02:31.208
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

02:31.291 --> 02:33.666
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

02:33.750 --> 02:35.916
<i>Jump once, clap twice</i>

02:36.000 --> 02:38.750
<i>Stomp one, two, three</i>
<i>Stomp, stomp, stomp</i>

02:38.833 --> 02:40.791
<i>That's Tilly's pattern</i>

02:47.208 --> 02:48.500
That was so fun.

02:48.583 --> 02:51.958
Tilly, I love your pattern dance. Tilly?

02:52.041 --> 02:54.833
-Stomp, stomp!
-Stomp, stomp, stomp!

02:58.583 --> 03:01.166
You're the best at stomping!

03:01.250 --> 03:02.583
Stomp, stomp, stomp!

03:02.666 --> 03:05.458
Tilly!

03:07.500 --> 03:09.875
Raffe? Raffe?!

03:10.875 --> 03:12.791
What's the matter, Lulu?

03:12.875 --> 03:15.875
I can't find Raffe. He was here.

03:16.791 --> 03:21.125
-Don't worry. We'll help you look.
-Yeah! Ready, everybody?

03:21.208 --> 03:24.083
-One, two, three, go!
-Yeah.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.833
-Raffe?
-Raffe!

03:26.916 --> 03:29.333
-Come here, Raffe!
-Raffe?

03:29.416 --> 03:30.458
Raffe?

03:30.541 --> 03:32.916
-Raffe!
-Raffe?

03:33.000 --> 03:33.875
Raffe?

03:33.958 --> 03:35.500
Where are you?!

03:35.583 --> 03:36.833
Not over here.

03:37.541 --> 03:38.500
Not here.

03:38.583 --> 03:40.000
Maybe under here?

03:40.875 --> 03:41.708
No.

03:41.791 --> 03:44.416
-Raffe!
-Raffe!

03:46.083 --> 03:47.375
Raffe?

03:47.458 --> 03:49.541
Raffe!

03:54.666 --> 03:59.041
-Tilly, you're not helping.
-We need to find Raffe!

03:59.125 --> 04:01.458
I don't know where he is!

04:01.541 --> 04:03.208
We'll find him, Lulu.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.791
We'll just keep looking.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.208
-I looked behind the bookcase.
-Raffe!

04:08.000 --> 04:09.708
Maybe I could look again.

04:12.125 --> 04:15.708
Tilly, you had Raffe?

04:17.583 --> 04:23.500
But Raffe is my special toy,
and I don't have to share him.

04:23.583 --> 04:29.375
But, Lulu, Raffe is so special,
even I wish I had a Raffe to play with.

04:29.458 --> 04:30.791
Me too.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.208
Me three.

04:32.291 --> 04:35.458
But there's only one Raffe.

04:36.041 --> 04:37.250
One.

04:38.791 --> 04:43.291
Well, maybe we could go to a place
where there are lots of Raffes.

04:43.375 --> 04:45.833
Lots of Raffes?!

04:47.208 --> 04:49.791
-Bailey, please, can we go?
-Sure.

04:50.291 --> 04:55.291
If we use our imaginations.

05:02.541 --> 05:05.333
-Wow!
-Wow!

05:06.083 --> 05:08.458
Oh it's so pretty!

05:09.541 --> 05:13.666
A magic castle in Raffeland.

05:13.750 --> 05:17.375
And I'm a wizard. With a magic wand.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.875
Then I'm a princess.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.750
-Yeah!
-See?

05:23.291 --> 05:25.000
Very princessy.

05:25.083 --> 05:29.208
Okay, Bailey. Can you make
more Raffes with your magic wand?

05:29.291 --> 05:31.625
Well, what's the magic word?

05:31.708 --> 05:32.791
It's…

05:33.708 --> 05:36.625
It's "Raffe-Kabaffe"!

05:36.708 --> 05:40.291
Oh, I was going to say "please,"
but that's a good one too.

05:42.291 --> 05:45.708
Raffe-Kabaffe!

05:45.791 --> 05:47.375
Wow!

05:47.458 --> 05:48.791
-Wow!
-You did it!

05:48.875 --> 05:51.208
-That one's for Tilly.
-Yay.

05:56.125 --> 05:58.791
-Make another one, Bailey.
-Okay.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.791
Raffe-Kabaffe!

06:04.166 --> 06:07.708
More, Bailey! More Raffes for all!

06:07.791 --> 06:09.250
-Yeah!
-Okay.

06:09.333 --> 06:14.458
Raffe-Kabaffe!

06:15.125 --> 06:16.500
Which one do I want?

06:16.583 --> 06:20.041
This is the best day of my life!

06:20.125 --> 06:25.708
Raffe-Kabaffe!

06:28.333 --> 06:30.875
So many Raffes!

06:30.958 --> 06:36.291
Raffe-Kaboom-Boom-Baffe!

06:40.291 --> 06:42.083
Excuse me.

06:46.958 --> 06:47.791
Hello?

06:48.666 --> 06:51.916
Is it just me,
or are there too many Raffes?

06:52.416 --> 06:54.291
Bailey, can you please stop?

06:54.375 --> 06:56.875
-Stop!
-There's too many Raffes!

06:56.958 --> 06:57.791
Okay.

06:59.041 --> 07:03.000
Raffe-Kabiffely-Boffely-Boo.

07:07.708 --> 07:09.708
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

07:11.958 --> 07:14.791
That was too many Raffes.

07:15.416 --> 07:18.625
It was, but now
there aren't enough Raffes.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.833
Look, Tilly's sad again.

07:21.750 --> 07:25.916
We want more Raffes, but not too many.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.541
How many do we need?

07:27.625 --> 07:31.041
If we're having a "how many" problem,

07:31.125 --> 07:33.250
we should go to…

07:34.250 --> 07:37.625
Maths Molly!

07:37.708 --> 07:39.291
Oh, wait.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.291
And poof!

07:44.666 --> 07:46.375
That was amazing, Bailey!

07:47.208 --> 07:48.250
I try.

07:48.333 --> 07:51.750
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

07:51.833 --> 07:54.833
I need to make the right number of Raffes.

07:58.500 --> 08:01.125
How many Raffes is that, big kids?

08:03.166 --> 08:04.291
<i>One.</i>

08:05.291 --> 08:08.333
My special Raffe.

08:11.666 --> 08:14.708
That's one Raffe,
and then we add one more.

08:14.791 --> 08:16.291
How many Raffes now?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.416
<i>Two.</i>

08:21.041 --> 08:26.333
So, adding one
is like counting to the next number.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.791
You're right, Lulu!

08:28.875 --> 08:32.125
So this Raffe is for you, Tilly.

08:36.333 --> 08:40.625
Two Raffes, and we add one more.
How many is that?

08:44.541 --> 08:45.791
<i>Three.</i>

08:45.875 --> 08:48.166
Hey, there's one for me now.

08:52.625 --> 08:57.583
Three Raffes, and then we add one more.
How many is that?

09:00.541 --> 09:01.625
<i>Four.</i>

09:02.125 --> 09:04.125
That one's for you, Franny.

09:04.208 --> 09:08.083
Thanks. But you don't have
a Raffe yet, Bailey.

09:11.250 --> 09:17.208
Four Raffes. And if we add one more,
how many Raffes is that?

09:18.875 --> 09:19.750
<i>Five.</i>

09:20.708 --> 09:23.458
Five Raffes for five babies.

09:23.541 --> 09:25.291
One Raffe for everyone.

09:25.375 --> 09:28.125
And what's it called
when you add one more?

09:28.875 --> 09:30.125
<i>Addition.</i>

09:31.208 --> 09:36.791
Addition? This princess likes addition.

09:37.625 --> 09:41.958
And now, it's time for a…

09:42.625 --> 09:44.791
Maths Party!

09:47.500 --> 09:48.916
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:49.000 --> 09:50.416
<i>We did math</i>s

09:50.500 --> 09:52.583
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:53.500 --> 09:56.416
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

09:56.500 --> 09:59.875
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

09:59.958 --> 10:00.791
Yeah!

10:00.875 --> 10:02.500
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

10:02.583 --> 10:03.916
<i>We did maths</i>

10:04.000 --> 10:06.416
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

10:06.916 --> 10:09.583
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

10:09.666 --> 10:14.416
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

10:14.500 --> 10:17.041
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

10:17.625 --> 10:20.166
<i>We love maths!</i>

10:22.541 --> 10:26.291
Now, we have one Raffe,
and we can add one more,

10:26.375 --> 10:29.000
until we get to five Raffes.

10:29.083 --> 10:29.916
Yeah.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.500
And poof.

10:32.625 --> 10:33.541
Hi!

10:34.916 --> 10:36.750
-Here, Raffe.
-Poof.

10:38.500 --> 10:39.375
Yay!

10:40.458 --> 10:41.833
And poof.

10:44.291 --> 10:45.458
Oh nice, Franny!

10:45.541 --> 10:47.791
And one more is…

10:48.416 --> 10:49.250
Poof.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.291
Five Raffes.

10:52.875 --> 10:55.958
-Yeah.
-One for everyone!

11:00.333 --> 11:02.708
Music!

11:07.833 --> 11:09.916
-Go, Lulu.
<i>-</i>Raffe!

11:12.208 --> 11:13.708
Tilly!

11:13.791 --> 11:15.708
Raffe!

11:17.000 --> 11:18.250
Your turn, Kip.

11:19.333 --> 11:20.958
Raffe!

11:22.375 --> 11:23.791
Your turn, Franny.

11:24.708 --> 11:25.916
Raffe!

11:31.916 --> 11:37.666
Thanks for helping with our Raffe problem.
We couldn't have done it without you.

11:37.750 --> 11:41.125
Hey, Bailey! Come on! Raffe dance!

11:41.208 --> 11:42.541
-Okay.
-Yeah!

11:42.625 --> 11:46.458
-Bye-bye, big kids. We love you.
-Raffe!

11:49.541 --> 11:52.541
Raffe-Kabaffe!

12:01.500 --> 12:04.083
<i>The babies are playing outside today.</i>

12:04.166 --> 12:08.958
I'm the Amazing Balancing Panda!

12:09.041 --> 12:15.083
Watch me balance Raffe and a ball.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.416
And now,

12:23.500 --> 12:29.750
the Amazing Balancing Panda
will balance Lulu too.

12:32.750 --> 12:33.833
It's Clickety!

12:35.083 --> 12:36.625
Ta-da!

12:38.250 --> 12:40.958
Come on. We've got to catch Clickety.

12:41.041 --> 12:43.833
Clickety Clock! It's Clickety Clock!

12:47.125 --> 12:49.833
Why are my tomato plants so droopy?

12:49.916 --> 12:52.875
Bail-Bail! Let's catch Clickety Clock!

12:52.958 --> 12:54.875
Lulu, my tomatoes!

12:57.291 --> 12:59.291
He is so funny!

13:01.125 --> 13:05.791
<i>Clickety Clock goes tickety-tock</i>
<i>Ticking the time away</i>

13:06.416 --> 13:07.500
<i>Clickety here</i>

13:07.583 --> 13:08.791
<i>Clickety there</i>

13:08.875 --> 13:11.208
<i>Where's Clickety Clock today?</i>

13:11.791 --> 13:16.666

<i>Clickety big surprise</i>

13:17.166 --> 13:18.375

There he goes! Now tell us what's next!

13:49.333 --> 13:50.166
Got you!

13:52.291 --> 13:54.291
What time is it, Clickety?

13:56.083 --> 13:58.333
Time to eat!

13:58.416 --> 13:59.416
<i>Chī.</i>

13:59.500 --> 14:03.041
Is it okay if I cook lunch today?

14:05.625 --> 14:06.875
Thanks, Clickety.

14:08.625 --> 14:12.291
Chef Franny is cooking today. Let's see…

14:12.375 --> 14:16.458
Chef Franny should have a helper.
But who should that be?

14:17.333 --> 14:20.166
Pick me! Hi!

14:21.000 --> 14:23.458
Let's see. Who should I pick?

14:23.541 --> 14:26.583
-Franny! Franny, over here!
-I just can't…

14:26.666 --> 14:32.083
It should be someone
who really wants to help.

14:33.291 --> 14:35.416
Pick me. Lulu.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.708
-Me. Me. Me. Me? Me?
-I pick…

14:38.791 --> 14:39.916
Lulu!

14:46.625 --> 14:52.875
-Hi!
-Today, we are making easy cheesy eggs!

14:52.958 --> 14:55.500
Yummy delicious!

14:56.250 --> 15:02.208
But first, here's everyone's
favourite Cookitybot, Cookitybot!

15:02.291 --> 15:06.208
-Hi, Cookity!
-Yay, Cookity!

15:07.750 --> 15:11.708
So, Cookitybot,
what ingredients do we need?

15:13.208 --> 15:16.416
Five slices of cheese.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.833
And five eggs!

15:20.375 --> 15:22.291
Five eggs. We need five eggs.

15:22.375 --> 15:24.875
-I'll get the eggs. Me! My job!
-Thank you.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.041
Be careful!

15:33.583 --> 15:35.500
We've got a lot of eggs.

15:36.291 --> 15:40.583
All right. Bring Cookity the first egg!

15:41.250 --> 15:42.750
The first egg! Yes!

15:42.833 --> 15:44.833
I will get the first egg.

15:54.416 --> 15:55.250
Oops.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.041
The egg broke.

15:57.875 --> 16:02.625
I'll clean it up. Broken eggs
are good food for my tomato plants.

16:02.708 --> 16:05.708
-Good! Then we're not wasting.
-Yay.

16:05.791 --> 16:11.916
Now, Lulu, eggs break easily.
You need to be very careful.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.500
I'm super careful,

16:14.583 --> 16:19.958
because I'm Lulu,
the Amazing Balancing Panda!

16:21.333 --> 16:24.000
Okay. One more egg.

16:27.125 --> 16:28.208
Ta-da!

16:28.291 --> 16:29.125
Maybe…

16:29.875 --> 16:30.708
Oops.

16:35.625 --> 16:38.041
Don't worry. I've got it.

16:39.958 --> 16:43.708
Lulu, maybe I should do the eggs.

16:43.791 --> 16:49.125
But I really want to crack the eggs.
That's the fun part.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.291
Okay. But when you carry an egg,

16:52.375 --> 16:56.666
you have to be very, very…

16:56.750 --> 16:58.958
Gonna do it again. Careful!

17:00.416 --> 17:01.333
Oops.

17:07.791 --> 17:10.875
These easy cheesy eggs aren't so easy.

17:10.958 --> 17:13.458
I broke a lot of eggs.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.250
Do we still have enough?

17:16.833 --> 17:18.166
I'm not sure.

17:18.791 --> 17:22.500
But maybe that's a maths problem!

17:22.583 --> 17:24.875
-Maths Molly!
-Yeah!

17:25.750 --> 17:28.833
Maths Molly!

17:29.750 --> 17:32.750
-There she goes! Let's catch her!
-There she goes!

17:38.291 --> 17:40.916
We're going to Maths Molly!

17:42.000 --> 17:43.791
There you go, little tomatoes.

17:43.875 --> 17:46.000
These eggs will help you grow.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.333
-Maths Molly!
-Bailey!

17:49.416 --> 17:50.250
Okay!

17:51.708 --> 17:55.666
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

17:55.750 --> 18:01.333
We need to know if we have enough eggs
for our easy cheesy eggs.

18:01.416 --> 18:03.708
There were a lot of eggs.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.875
-But then some broke.
-So how many are left?

18:07.958 --> 18:14.208
<i>Babies, you can learn how many eggs</i>
<i>you have left by using subtraction.</i>

18:14.291 --> 18:16.708
<i>Taking away one egg at a time.</i>

18:17.250 --> 18:20.750
That's how many eggs we started with.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.208
How many is that?

18:24.208 --> 18:25.125
<i>Eight.</i>

18:25.833 --> 18:28.583
And then I dropped one.

18:28.666 --> 18:33.500
Yeah. Eight, take away one,
is how many, big kids?

18:35.625 --> 18:36.791
<i>Seven.</i>

18:37.500 --> 18:40.833
But then I dropped another one.

18:40.916 --> 18:42.583
-Yeah.
-Oh no.

18:43.500 --> 18:47.875
So, seven, take away one, is how many?

18:50.291 --> 18:51.250
<i>Six.</i>

18:52.000 --> 18:55.333
And then, well, I dropped another one.

18:55.916 --> 18:56.875
Yeah.

18:58.791 --> 19:03.291
Six, take away one, is how many?

19:05.083 --> 19:06.041
<i>Five.</i>

19:06.958 --> 19:09.333
And then I didn't drop any more.

19:09.416 --> 19:14.958
And five eggs is exactly how many I need

19:15.041 --> 19:17.625
to cook my easy cheesy eggs!

19:19.083 --> 19:22.083
Lulu, you didn't ruin lunch.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.791
Yay! I didn't ruin lunch!

19:25.916 --> 19:29.416
And you figured that out
by using subtraction.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.916
So now we can have a…

19:32.000 --> 19:35.916
-Maths Party!
-Yeah!

19:36.000 --> 19:37.416
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

19:37.500 --> 19:38.916
<i>We did math</i>s

19:39.000 --> 19:41.083
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

19:42.000 --> 19:44.916
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

19:45.000 --> 19:48.375
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

19:48.458 --> 19:49.291
Yeah!

19:49.375 --> 19:51.000
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

19:51.083 --> 19:52.416
<i>We did maths</i>

19:52.500 --> 19:54.916
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

19:55.416 --> 19:58.083
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

19:58.166 --> 20:02.916
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

20:03.000 --> 20:05.541
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

20:06.125 --> 20:08.666
<i>We love maths!</i>

20:10.666 --> 20:15.208
And now, I put in the last egg.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.958
-Yay!
-I did it! I put in all five eggs!

20:21.041 --> 20:23.541
And now Cookitybot can cook!

20:23.625 --> 20:25.833
Yay. Okay.

20:27.791 --> 20:28.625
Push.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.583
He's mixing!

20:40.875 --> 20:42.458
He's cooking!

20:52.291 --> 20:54.916
Easy cheesy eggs!

21:01.166 --> 21:03.041
Yummy!

21:03.125 --> 21:06.166
Franny, your eggs were the cheesiest.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.250
But not the easiest.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.875
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

21:11.625 --> 21:15.416
So good!
I subtracted everything on my plate.

21:16.333 --> 21:21.125
I want to subtract some more.
Let's play the five babies game.

21:21.666 --> 21:24.958
Good idea! Let's hop and bop!

21:25.041 --> 21:26.375
Yeah!

21:26.458 --> 21:27.916
<i>Five babies hopping</i>

21:28.000 --> 21:30.333
<i>Hop-hop-hopping round a tree</i>

21:31.250 --> 21:33.458
<i>Kip hop-hoppity hops away</i>

21:33.541 --> 21:35.000
Look! A bumblebee!

21:36.125 --> 21:40.250
<i>Four babies tapping</i>
<i>Tap-tap-tapping on our knees</i>

21:40.958 --> 21:45.625
<i>Let's all get a snack in</i>
<i>Pass the ice cream please</i>

21:45.708 --> 21:47.750
<i>Tilly leaves to take a bath</i>

21:47.833 --> 21:49.708
<i>Now we're only three</i>

21:50.500 --> 21:54.541
<i>Three babies skipping</i>
<i>Skip-skip-skipping on their toes</i>

21:55.041 --> 21:59.250
<i>Skipping round the garden</i>
<i>Bailey stops to smell a rose</i>

21:59.333 --> 22:04.041
<i>So now there's two babies sliding</i>
<i>Slide-slide-sliding down a slide</i>

22:04.875 --> 22:08.791
<i>-Lulu keeps on sliding</i>
<i>-Franny takes off for a ride</i>

22:08.875 --> 22:09.708
See you later!

22:09.791 --> 22:13.666
<i>One baby dancing</i>
<i>Dance with Raffe round the room</i>

22:14.250 --> 22:18.291
<i>Everybody join the fun</i>
<i>So I'm not the only one</i>

22:18.375 --> 22:19.208
Come on!

22:19.291 --> 22:23.250
<i>One, two, three, four, five</i>
<i>Count, everyone</i>

22:24.041 --> 22:28.458
<i>-Five, four, three, two, one</i>
<i>-And now we're done</i>

22:33.083 --> 22:35.083
We're still here!

22:35.583 --> 22:40.875
Yeah! And thanks for helping us
make easy cheesy eggs.

22:40.958 --> 22:44.833
-Yeah.
-And learning about subtraction.

22:44.916 --> 22:47.958
-Yeah.
-Bye-bye, big kids. Love you.

22:48.041 --> 22:50.750
-Bye! Love you!
-We love you!

22:50.833 --> 22:51.833
Bye!

22:52.583 --> 22:55.041
-Come back soon!
-Love you, bye!

22:56.750 --> 22:59.291
-Nice job, Lulu.
-Nice heart.

22:59.375 --> 23:00.333
Bye-bye-bye!
