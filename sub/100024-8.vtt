00:01.262 --> 00:03.220
Hey, you slayed that
Herston bray-le.

00:03.264 --> 00:04.830
[David] Doesn'’t matter.

00:04.874 --> 00:06.223
It'’s Woods-Trap,
she all over me.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.790
I need that letter
of recommendation.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.096
Willie Derrick here
just got dusted

00:09.139 --> 00:10.532
front of the whole damn jay-nx.

00:10.575 --> 00:12.099
When the boss go, you go.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.057
You remember?

00:14.101 --> 00:15.189
Yo, you'’re like my best friend.

00:15.232 --> 00:16.625
What did you do to your suit?

00:16.668 --> 00:17.582
Whatever I wanted.

00:17.626 --> 00:20.107
Hey, sir, get in the car.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.673
Now.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.675
I'’ma miss you sometimes.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.200
Why did you want
extra sessions David?

00:26.243 --> 00:27.679
[David] We should all own this.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.725
You fuck around somebody
might die or go to jail.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.074
Shit or both.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.250
If that happens, Tio Teo
would definitely know

00:33.294 --> 00:34.295
before we want '’em to.

00:34.338 --> 00:37.211
[speaking in foreign language]

00:37.254 --> 00:39.256
Hey Mr. Teo, it'’s nice to...

00:40.605 --> 00:42.564
Need something?

00:42.607 --> 00:44.174
-[gun fires]
-[laughter]

00:44.218 --> 00:46.133
[Teo] My brother in law your
former boss he was trying to,

00:46.176 --> 00:47.656
I didn'’t work for Sky.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.266
So you was looking out
for Sky for no reason?

00:49.310 --> 00:51.703
[David] He ain'’t ever
want me to move.

00:51.747 --> 00:52.835
Well I do.

00:56.404 --> 00:59.711
[office phone rings]

01:01.148 --> 01:04.455
See right there, I'’ve been
waiting here for 20 minutes.

01:04.499 --> 01:07.763
My grandson was supposed
to bring plywood yesterday,

01:07.806 --> 01:10.070
help board up my
windows for the storm.

01:10.113 --> 01:15.249
Boy just fell right off
the map, not a word.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.250
Kids.

01:16.293 --> 01:17.120
Can you imagine?

01:17.164 --> 01:19.905
I all but raised that child.

01:19.949 --> 01:24.214
Respect, seems like it'’s
just lost in the past.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.608
I had to learn the hard way.

01:26.651 --> 01:28.653
Wasn'’t until I lost
someone close to me

01:28.697 --> 01:33.310
that I figured it out,
you gotta love the living.

01:33.354 --> 01:37.140
[Woman] Anthony Johnston,
picking up for Blanca Vieja.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.359
Well that'’s me.

01:38.402 --> 01:40.491
Okie-doke, you be
careful out there now.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.536
You too ma'’am.

01:44.974 --> 01:48.673
Hey, your total is $314.59.

01:56.028 --> 01:57.334
You change your hair?

01:59.815 --> 02:00.990
Just a little bit.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.035
Looks nice.

02:04.341 --> 02:05.777
Thanks, here you go.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.389
'’Preciate you, you have
yourself a great one.

02:08.432 --> 02:09.651
Nice seeing you again.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.609
I hope your grandmother
feels better.

02:11.653 --> 02:13.524
Do you need a receipt?

02:13.568 --> 02:15.265
I'’m good.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.092
Okay.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.236
They just filled it, I mean...

02:29.279 --> 02:31.281
-Yup.
-No questions asked?

02:31.325 --> 02:32.108
Mm-hmm.

02:35.198 --> 02:37.287
Pharmacy didn'’t
call me to verify.

02:37.331 --> 02:40.160
Well I guess
sometimes they don'’t.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.988
The systems working though,
that'’s what matters.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.121
Your piece.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.211
And the cash.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.299
It'’s coming.

02:49.343 --> 02:51.214
[Miss Elijah] When?

02:51.258 --> 02:52.259
When it comes.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.304
When it comes is
not the agreement.

02:54.348 --> 02:56.393
You and your boys are
running things sloppy

02:56.437 --> 02:59.004
I saw a packet outside
Hert-shews it won'’t last with
that.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.355
and I want my money
before it crashes down.

03:01.398 --> 03:04.140
Why you wishing ill on us?

03:04.184 --> 03:08.144
What you should be thinking
'’bout, is how to keep me happy.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.451
That way things don'’t get
so sloppy they lead back

03:10.494 --> 03:13.280
to you and that goober
number on the script pad.

03:13.323 --> 03:14.890
Hmm.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.326
I can'’t find the left one.

03:19.111 --> 03:19.938
Just one more minute.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.288
Can I have you gone?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.465
Hurry up and get there.

03:24.508 --> 03:27.337
You can go back to getting
your nuts gargled in piece pa,

03:27.381 --> 03:29.078
you don'’t need to
hang me, I'’m out.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.122
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

03:30.166 --> 03:32.690
Huh uh, take off, you heard me.

03:32.734 --> 03:37.347
And go tell your CEO to give
me my share, or this is done.

03:39.175 --> 03:43.701
Now you gotta go, '’cuz next time
I see you, you dead.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.927
He ain'’t gonna kill nobody
but where is your shoe?

03:53.363 --> 03:56.192
[pounding on door]

03:57.280 --> 03:58.716
Aye G.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.109
[door slams]

04:00.152 --> 04:01.763
What the fuck is you doing?

04:01.806 --> 04:03.460
Bro, you gotta come now man,

04:03.504 --> 04:05.897
Willie Derrick took some
shit man, he ain'’t right.

04:07.508 --> 04:08.378
He ain'’t right bro.

04:16.821 --> 04:20.260
[theme song plays]

04:59.908 --> 05:01.866
[school bell ringing]

05:01.910 --> 05:05.914
I see before me right
here in this auditorium,

05:05.957 --> 05:09.004
the future leaders
of this planet.

05:09.047 --> 05:13.051
A planet now more than ever
that is in desperate need,

05:13.095 --> 05:14.966
of courageous voices.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.707
[clapping]

05:16.751 --> 05:19.362
Are you looking,
have you seen him?

05:19.406 --> 05:20.798
In here?
Nah.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.366
I looked too, Sam
wouldn'’t miss this.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.368
It was here at Galvin
that I learned discipline

05:25.412 --> 05:27.588
and excellence of role
models like our own

05:27.631 --> 05:30.591
Dr. Woods-Trap, who
drove me to never let up.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.288
Those lessons that propelled me

05:32.332 --> 05:35.030
to scholarships at
Herston Preparatory.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.597
Of course I'’ll write
a recommendation,

05:36.640 --> 05:39.034
I was just waiting
for you to ask.

05:39.077 --> 05:41.384
I'’m so proud of you David.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.908
Herston will be
lucky to have you.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.519
-Yes!
-[door shuts]

05:45.562 --> 05:49.958
I'’ve never forgotten where I
came from, a housing project.

05:50.001 --> 05:53.135
Single bedroom
apartment, four siblings.

05:54.571 --> 05:58.488
You must always,
and without fail,

05:58.532 --> 06:01.796
reach out that all
important helping hand

06:01.839 --> 06:04.799
as those who truly
cared did for me.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.977
[crowd clapping]

06:10.457 --> 06:11.632
[camera clicks]

06:11.675 --> 06:12.633
Thank you so much
for coming today sir.

06:12.676 --> 06:13.764
Your speech was amazing.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.375
Thank you for such kind words,

06:15.418 --> 06:17.028
so where will your journey
take you from Galvin?

06:17.072 --> 06:18.639
I'’m applying to MAST.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.424
Oh a guardian of the sea, hey
much work to be done there.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.557
You strike me as
someone who can inspire,

06:23.600 --> 06:26.473
and our waters they can
never have enough advocates.

06:28.083 --> 06:32.087
[camera clicks]

06:32.130 --> 06:35.438
Hello sir, I'’m David
Young, I want to thank you

06:35.482 --> 06:37.222
for inspiring us all today.

06:37.266 --> 06:38.833
Well, it was nice to meet
you David Young, and...

06:38.876 --> 06:40.530
Oh, I like that confident
grip you'’ve got.

06:40.574 --> 06:44.534
Thank you sir, Dr. Woods-Trap
and the faculty here has,

06:44.578 --> 06:47.276
they showed us the importance
of being confidant,

06:47.319 --> 06:48.538
and really setting goals.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.235
[laughs] So it seems.

06:51.498 --> 06:54.936
What you said earlier,
about never forgetting

06:54.979 --> 06:57.591
where you come
from, I felt that.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.811
See I live in
Homestead Village and,

07:00.855 --> 07:03.118
I share a room with my brother,

07:03.161 --> 07:08.340
my mother, my mother
sometimes struggles with,

07:09.516 --> 07:12.344
she struggles with
addiction and...

07:13.868 --> 07:16.392
but I'’m committed like you were,

07:16.436 --> 07:19.221
to making something of
myself, to attending Hers

07:19.264 --> 07:23.225
and then a prestigious
university, those are my goals.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.967
Well, those are mighty fine
goals you'’ve got there, sir.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.499
"Some I love who are
dead are watchers..."

07:36.543 --> 07:39.197
"Are watchers of the moon."

07:41.069 --> 07:43.506
Dr. WT used to teach us too.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.552
It'’s David right?

07:45.595 --> 07:48.511
I just wanted to say that
we come from the same place,

07:48.555 --> 07:50.905
I wonder if possible
if you could write me

07:50.948 --> 07:52.820
a letter of
recommendation to Herston?

07:52.863 --> 07:54.648
They prefer them
from you teachers.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.737
Um, I know, and I'’m
going to ask them too,

07:56.780 --> 08:01.742
but it would mean a lot,
coming from you, especially.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.919
I'’m sorry if I'm asking too
much I really don'’t mean to,

08:04.962 --> 08:07.965
Never, apologize
for asking a favor

08:08.009 --> 08:11.447
from those who can help.
I want you to call my aid
Katheryn

08:11.491 --> 08:13.101
directly on Monday,
we'’ll make sure

08:13.144 --> 08:14.450
you get that helping hand.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.765

08:26.941 --> 08:29.639
[treadmill beeps]

08:32.599 --> 08:34.252
[breathing heavily] Hello.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.906
[Automated Voice On Phone]
This is an important automated

08:35.950 --> 08:38.953
message from Galvin Middle School, Seren Kelly was counted

08:38.996 --> 08:41.608
as absent this morning,
if you did not authorize

08:41.651 --> 08:45.568
his absence, please call
the school and let us know.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.793
Did you physically check the
classroom yourself to see if he
was there?

08:52.836 --> 08:58.146
No but like I already told
you, I spoke with his teacher.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.627
They could have taken
attendance incorrectly, correct?

09:00.670 --> 09:02.672
The fact that I have to
come down here because you

09:02.716 --> 09:04.674
are too lazy to walk to
the other end of the hall.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.023
Excuse me?

09:13.422 --> 09:16.338
Once I find Seren, you
and Principal Fallow

09:16.381 --> 09:17.774
and I are going to have a talk.

09:24.607 --> 09:27.654
Mr.Robbins'’ new classroom
is right down this way.

09:27.697 --> 09:28.611
Thank you.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.178
Any time.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.876
I'’m sure he's here,
I just, the administrative

09:32.920 --> 09:34.661
incompetence at this school.

09:34.704 --> 09:37.925
I'’m happy to help,
that'’s the one.

09:37.968 --> 09:41.363
[knocking]

09:41.406 --> 09:44.453
Mrs. Kelly, are you here
for Seren'’s homework?

09:44.496 --> 09:46.760
I planned on sending it at the
end of the day in a packet.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.632
[intense music]

09:49.676 --> 09:50.720
Is everything alright?

09:55.769 --> 09:58.815
Everything'’s fine,
thank you for your...

10:31.152 --> 10:32.762
Yes?

10:32.806 --> 10:36.200
I just wanted to thank you...
for having Representative Reed

10:36.244 --> 10:37.854
come and speak to us all today.

10:37.898 --> 10:40.988
Somehow I thought you'’d feel
a connection to that man.

10:41.031 --> 10:44.731
You always say keep an eye
out for the role models right?

10:44.774 --> 10:47.516
That'’s the one you chose.
Not surprising.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.259
Is there something wrong?

10:51.302 --> 10:53.217
Yes, yes there is.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.785
You thought dragging your
mother'’s name through the mud

10:55.829 --> 10:59.006
was the right way to get
into his good graces.

10:59.049 --> 11:03.097
Using her to benefit you,
exploiting your past,

11:03.140 --> 11:04.838
your families pain.

11:04.881 --> 11:09.451
I was just, I was just
trying to connect with him,

11:09.494 --> 11:12.933
I mean we come from
the same place.

11:12.976 --> 11:15.718
I want to be good, like him.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.808
Good, then you'’re
perfect for each other.

11:18.852 --> 11:19.983
I don'’t get it.

11:20.027 --> 11:23.900
Yes you do David, you do.
It is cheap.

11:23.944 --> 11:27.251
You are trying to manipulate
him, of all people?

11:28.426 --> 11:29.819
I don'’t get why you--

11:29.863 --> 11:32.779
Congressman Reed is an
embarrassment and a regret.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.304
What, why?

11:36.347 --> 11:37.827
Because he'’s been
doing the very thing

11:37.871 --> 11:40.874
I'’m watching you do right now.
That'’s been him.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.920
Cashing in on pain, putting
his past on display like that

11:43.964 --> 11:46.967
to propel himself forward,
never once looking back.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.883
Only showing up in the so-called
ghetto where he grew up

11:49.926 --> 11:53.364
when it provides a convenient
photo-op for re-election.

11:55.018 --> 11:58.674
So, go ahead David,

11:59.849 --> 12:01.764
you be just like him.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.424
He said he would
call Herston for me.

12:10.381 --> 12:11.818
He don'’t have to do that.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.472
You think you'’re the first one

12:14.516 --> 12:16.779
that he has made
hollow promises too.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.738
If you think that man will
lift a finger to help you

12:18.781 --> 12:20.740
you'’ve got another thing coming.

12:26.049 --> 12:28.573
[intense frequency]

12:34.449 --> 12:36.843
-Is this a joke?
-Excuse me?

12:36.886 --> 12:39.019
You the only always telling
me to pick up context clues.

12:39.062 --> 12:42.544
Look at every angle, I'’m doing
everything I can to survive.

Not just here, fuck here.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.330
Hey.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.941
Here I'’ll prolly get two
meals and maybe I'’m safe.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.638
At least I thought I was safe.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.161
I thought if I played
these stupid ass rules

12:51.205 --> 12:52.946
y'’all keep changing
I'’d be alright.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.904
So you mean to tell me I
gotta play games here too.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.427
This is not a game.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.952
It is a game. Look, I'’m jumping
around trying to please

12:58.995 --> 13:01.258
all y'’all, trying not to
get fucking shot at home

13:01.302 --> 13:04.392
or ran up on, and
you mad, you mad

13:04.435 --> 13:05.610
at me because I'’m
trying to make it

13:05.654 --> 13:07.699
a different way than
what you say huh?

13:07.743 --> 13:11.965
Really Doc, that'’s you?
That'’s how you gonna do me?

13:12.008 --> 13:13.314
Alright now David.

13:13.357 --> 13:14.184
I'’m trying to live
and you'’re worried

13:14.228 --> 13:15.751
about me being shamed?

13:22.627 --> 13:28.938
Hey, I just came to ask you
for your recommendation,

13:28.982 --> 13:31.767
that'’s all I came for
because I worked my ass off

13:31.811 --> 13:33.464
in this class and I deserve it.

13:42.038 --> 13:44.084
Will you write one for me?

13:44.127 --> 13:45.955
[school bell rings]

13:45.999 --> 13:47.522

Did you see Mrs. Kelly outside?

14:45.536 --> 14:47.016
Yes ma'’am.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.626
She'’s looking for Seren
have you seen him today?

14:48.670 --> 14:50.933
Is he okay?
He hurt?

14:50.977 --> 14:54.719
Why would you think that,
is that what he told you?

14:55.982 --> 14:59.028
[muffled speaking]

15:04.251 --> 15:07.994
You were about to say
something about Seren. David?

15:09.082 --> 15:12.085
[intense tones]

15:16.132 --> 15:16.916
David.

15:18.178 --> 15:23.139
Seren. He gave this
to me a few weeks ago,

15:23.183 --> 15:24.967
I didn'’t think nothing
of it then but.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.150
Wait here I'’m gonna get
Dr. Bree.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.545
[Mr. Kelly] I need you to
explain what'’s going on.

15:37.588 --> 15:40.330
[Principal Fallow]
I promise I will be right back.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.245
David, David, I
need you to tell me

15:42.289 --> 15:45.031
what'’s going on right now.
Seren hasn'’t been acting right

15:45.074 --> 15:47.076
and I know it has
something to do with you.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.991
Jess.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.993
Is he in danger?

15:51.037 --> 15:54.170
What did you do to him I
know this is your fault.

15:54.214 --> 15:58.087
Please you won'’t get in any
trouble I promise just tell me.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.264
[Mr. Kelly] Jess.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.091
You look me right--

16:02.135 --> 16:03.484

16:03.527 --> 16:05.703
Mrs.Kelly, I'’m Dr. Bree.

16:15.757 --> 16:20.066
Shinobi, you kidding me?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.113
Man you for real, Willie D?

16:26.289 --> 16:27.029
Fuck.

16:29.031 --> 16:32.469
Folks have a bad habit of
letting people sneak up on them.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.167
What did you just say?

16:34.210 --> 16:36.169
You have the count?

16:36.212 --> 16:39.346
Yeah, yeah, chill.
Give me a second.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.522
Aye, come here.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.439

16:45.482 --> 16:46.527
Hold it down, a'’ight?

16:46.570 --> 16:47.571

16:49.095 --> 16:51.314

we got company.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.273
Okay for sure.

16:53.316 --> 16:56.711
Yo, what was you talking
about when I just came up.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.191
Mind your fucking business.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.500
Nigga what?

17:03.544 --> 17:04.545
Trying to figure
out who the fuck

17:04.588 --> 17:06.155
you think you'’re talking to.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.244
Yo I don'’t need you asking
me all these damn questions.

17:08.288 --> 17:09.941
I can handle my own shit.

17:09.985 --> 17:12.248
So why you all jittery, like
you'’re hiding something?

17:12.292 --> 17:15.251
Yo, I'’m not hiding nothing,
it'’s just not your problem.

17:15.295 --> 17:18.733
If it bothers the money,
then it bothers Teo,

17:18.776 --> 17:20.039
and then it bothers me.

17:23.999 --> 17:28.221
One of the corner boys,
the G, he swallowed some pills.

17:28.264 --> 17:29.700
Where?

17:29.744 --> 17:31.180
No he'’s fucked up man,
but it'’s his own damn fault,

17:31.224 --> 17:33.313
he should have known better,
throwing up his shit.

17:33.356 --> 17:36.272
That'’s somebody's kid nigga,
take me to him.

17:36.316 --> 17:39.145
Hey, yo, hey! Polygram!

Yo we gotta go.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.103

is wrong with you?

17:41.147 --> 17:43.584
[police sirens]

17:43.627 --> 17:44.672
Don'’t try to run.

17:46.369 --> 17:47.849
[Ray] Fuck.

17:47.892 --> 17:50.243
C'’mon man, you know Ray
didn'’t wanna run from us.

17:50.286 --> 17:52.941
He'’s our friend, and
that'’d hurt our feelings.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.029
Isn'’t that right Ray?

17:55.030 --> 17:56.162
Talkin'’ about the new guy here,

17:56.205 --> 17:57.859
haven'’t seen you
around here before.

17:57.902 --> 18:00.949
C'’mon Ray Ray,
time for your weekly checkup.

18:00.992 --> 18:03.212
Don'’t worry, your man's
coming with us too.

18:05.345 --> 18:06.172
Hey, you hungry?

18:07.216 --> 18:08.087
I can eat.

18:09.784 --> 18:10.611
[Woman On Intercom]
Welcome to Pollo Cubano,

18:10.654 --> 18:12.221
may I take your order.

18:12.265 --> 18:15.050
Yeah, let me get a rotisserie
chicken and a side of yucca,

18:15.094 --> 18:16.617
and some extra rice
and beans with that.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.968
Ray will have the same, extra
cilantro sauce with that.

18:24.190 --> 18:29.978
Yo, that'’s how you like it,
extra cilantro sauce aye?

18:32.241 --> 18:34.287
Hey you wants plantains
or somethin'’, or nah?

18:39.205 --> 18:42.599
He knows better,
that'’s why I'm...

18:44.732 --> 18:46.037
my son needs...

18:49.302 --> 18:50.129
he knows better.

18:53.393 --> 18:57.005
I'’ve been trying to
teach him to protect.

18:58.267 --> 19:02.706
Seren you cannot...
you have to mindful

19:02.750 --> 19:06.275
of who you hang out
with, you have to.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.973
You are walking down the
street with a certain...

19:10.671 --> 19:14.327
a certain group of friends and
the police will just see you

19:14.370 --> 19:17.112
as one of them they don'’t
know that you'’re not like that

19:17.156 --> 19:20.159
all they see is brown,
brown, brown, so they...

19:23.031 --> 19:25.338
and I have to protect
him from that.

19:26.426 --> 19:27.992
That'’s my job.

19:29.429 --> 19:30.299
Me, me, and...

19:33.520 --> 19:34.695
and his dad Ray.

19:36.914 --> 19:42.311
He'’s out there and... I don't
know if I have been the best...

19:47.621 --> 19:51.146
[sobbing]

19:51.190 --> 19:54.323
You'’re a good mom,
of course you are.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.761
[sobbing]

20:00.503 --> 20:01.200
I'’m sure...

20:03.332 --> 20:06.292
well we'’re all just
doing our best.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.381
As I was saying with
the storm approaching

20:08.424 --> 20:10.209
I think we need to get
the police involved.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.689
We should notify
them right away.

20:12.733 --> 20:15.257
Seren might be with
his father in Tampa.

20:15.301 --> 20:16.258
Wh..., what?

20:21.002 --> 20:23.091
I'’m his step father, you know

20:23.134 --> 20:25.180
he'’s been asking me
about the man lately.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.269
He has?

20:27.313 --> 20:32.405
Seren talks to me,
we'’re close, he trusts me.

20:40.064 --> 20:42.110
Let'’s try to get Ern on the
phone before we do anything,

20:42.153 --> 20:44.765
no need to ring the alarm if
we know where he might be.

20:44.808 --> 20:48.116
That could take hours, you
know he never pays his bills.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.379
Even when he does he
doesn'’t answer my calls.

20:50.423 --> 20:54.296
Let'’s at least give
it a try, okay?

20:54.340 --> 20:58.344
We'’ll track him down, I'll drive
up there if I have to.

21:03.349 --> 21:07.396
Use the room, call whoever
you need, I'’ll be right back.

21:08.571 --> 21:09.746
Thank you.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.318
Hang in there.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.841

21:17.885 --> 21:20.409
[Jess crying]

21:27.677 --> 21:29.375
Come on, let'’s go for a walk.

21:32.029 --> 21:36.295
This is serious David,
no more games.

21:42.518 --> 21:45.869
Fallow said that Seren gave
this to you a few weeks ago.

21:50.396 --> 21:55.879
"Thanks for today, I love you,
not in a weird way but close.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.795
You'’re the closest
thing I have to real.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.323
Only time I ever wanted to stay

22:04.366 --> 22:08.239
in my own house was when
you were there, I miss you."

22:11.112 --> 22:13.419
Doesn'’t that seem, off?

22:16.291 --> 22:18.902
Why'’d you give this note
to Principal Fallow?

22:22.036 --> 22:23.690
You'’re gonna answer me David,

22:23.733 --> 22:25.344
and you'’re gonna answer me now.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.219
He gave me that note.

22:32.786 --> 22:35.354
I was supposed to keep
it but I...

22:37.268 --> 22:38.879
I'’m losing Dr. Bree.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.361
Sometimes you get
tired of losing.

22:45.494 --> 22:50.934
Maybe this'’ll help find
something, or keep something.

22:54.677 --> 22:58.594
All them movies, where
the friend end up dead,

22:58.638 --> 23:01.205
or doing something because
you didn'’t do anything,

23:02.859 --> 23:04.383
well I'’m doing something.

23:08.256 --> 23:10.301
I felt like I was
losing him too.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.873
Like you lost Sky.

23:22.357 --> 23:25.360
You do a lot of half
answering, you know that?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.188
You'’re speaking around things.

23:29.103 --> 23:31.366
Do you know where
Seren is right now?

23:35.501 --> 23:36.632
No.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.859
Is there something about his
home life I need to know about?

23:48.644 --> 23:50.080
That'’s his home life.

23:55.738 --> 23:59.350
Gonna go back in there now
and hand over this note.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.353
Does that worry you?

24:03.050 --> 24:04.486
No it'’s...

24:07.620 --> 24:09.230
no.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.452
I'’m trying to make sure that
your friend is safe too.

24:14.583 --> 24:16.193
You understand that, right?

24:17.543 --> 24:20.850
No matter where he
is a 13 year old

24:20.894 --> 24:24.201
alone is always in danger.

24:36.213 --> 24:40.043
David, bring it back
before Thanksgiving.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.306
Before...

24:45.527 --> 24:48.225
if you took it,
we can make this right.

24:48.269 --> 24:51.185
If you took that script
pad bring it back

24:52.229 --> 24:53.361
and we will fix it.

24:56.016 --> 24:59.367
But I'’m done.
I'’m done playing games.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.647
-[knocking on door]
-What?

25:18.691 --> 25:21.998
I told you my money'’s coming.
We really gotta do this again?

I'’m here because of the storm

27:10.803 --> 27:12.239
I wouldn'’t have made the trip up

27:12.282 --> 27:14.502
but I couldn'’t
find Raynan or Des.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.199
-Police.
-I heard.

27:18.332 --> 27:19.638

28:02.942 --> 28:04.291

28:07.120 --> 28:11.341

my cuts still in there.

28:33.799 --> 28:38.151
Still heavy. This week any
different than last two?

28:39.979 --> 28:41.328
You move more product?

28:42.024 --> 28:44.374
Nah, not more.

28:49.815 --> 28:51.555
You sure about that?

28:52.469 --> 28:56.082
I mean, as far as I know, yeah.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.736
I don'’t do the hand to hands.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.303
Well who else got hands
on this besides you three?

29:01.827 --> 29:04.220
Nobody, as far as I know.

29:09.051 --> 29:09.835
You look scared.

29:13.099 --> 29:14.100

29:40.996 --> 29:44.957
Yeah, he don'’t know
how to talk to folks.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.918
But that'’s not what I pay him
for, he'’s just doing his job.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.880
It'’s his job to rough
handle those who loyal?

29:54.923 --> 29:56.882
Who earning, who
bringing in profit?

29:56.925 --> 29:59.972
Threatening they families,
they little brothers?

30:00.015 --> 30:02.539
Yo, you are scared.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.021
I aint no snitch,

30:06.065 --> 30:09.546
he stepped to one of mine,
and I aint go step down.

30:09.590 --> 30:10.983
I'’ll tell him to
change his tactics.

30:11.026 --> 30:14.943
His tactics drawing attention.
This my neighborhood.

30:14.987 --> 30:18.033
His tactics make it harder
for people to stay low-key.

30:18.077 --> 30:20.949
Like you said, I don'’t
need to be squaring up

30:20.993 --> 30:22.385
with somebody from the...

30:22.429 --> 30:25.954
Yo, yo, Papa! He threatened to
hurt your family?

30:25.998 --> 30:30.132
Like I said, I aint no snitch.

30:30.176 --> 30:30.959
How old are you now?

30:33.092 --> 30:35.572
14, I just turned.

30:37.009 --> 30:38.314
I'’ll handle this sir.

30:41.143 --> 30:45.365
I'’ll talk to him, alright?

30:45.408 --> 30:50.674
Don'’t need you burning
before you'’re 15. [laughing]

30:50.718 --> 30:53.547
It looks like Desmond has
met his match after all.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.335
Listen,

31:00.902 --> 31:03.687
I know it took a lot for you
to say all of that to me.

31:08.518 --> 31:13.697
But you did the right thing,
I respect that.

31:23.229 --> 31:24.970
I'’ll go and have
a chat with him.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.321
How you know when

31:32.020 --> 31:32.978
I got a hunch.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.942
[gasping]

32:17.109 --> 32:19.372
[crying]

32:37.172 --> 32:38.043

33:05.113 --> 33:05.984
Let him go.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.236
Where'’s Raynan?

33:41.280 --> 33:42.150
Home.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.500
[laughing]

33:44.544 --> 33:46.154
We have to have a talk
about your nephew.

33:48.722 --> 33:51.029
No more traffic,
foot, cars, nothing.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.073
[Men] What?

33:52.117 --> 33:53.988
We closing up shop
E let em know.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.251
If they even get the
idea of doing side trade,

33:56.295 --> 33:58.862
it will get back and
it will be dealt with.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.212
The '’Ville is closed.

34:00.255 --> 34:02.301
-Damn man for real.
-For how long?

34:02.344 --> 34:03.084

34:17.359 --> 34:20.232
Look, you all on clean up,

34:20.275 --> 34:23.148
Wipe it down, leave him where
he was when y'’all found him.

34:23.191 --> 34:25.324
Make it look like nobody
was there but him.

34:25.367 --> 34:26.847
Yeah with what?

35:24.557 --> 35:25.993
You gave him the count?

35:26.689 --> 35:27.951

35:31.172 --> 35:33.305

35:33.348 --> 35:35.263
I didn'’t tell him we

35:35.307 --> 35:36.743
He wasn'’t supposed to
have all that money, man.

35:36.786 --> 35:38.136
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

35:38.179 --> 35:40.486

36:05.337 --> 36:09.079

36:11.169 --> 36:14.259
My dad when he saw it he

36:15.782 --> 36:19.220
He beat the shit out of
me and Teo came after,

36:19.264 --> 36:21.309

up real bad and...

36:26.401 --> 36:27.663

36:31.014 --> 36:35.367

36:37.020 --> 36:38.196
He took it the wrong way Dae.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.243
And dad'’s not here no more.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.207

36:59.042 --> 37:02.742
He asked me where my
dad was, and I told him.

37:06.528 --> 37:11.316

37:42.651 --> 37:46.351
