WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.213
Why do you hate
Madame de Montrachet?

00:12.213 --> 00:13.781
<i>You do not need
to understand, Valmont,</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:15.182
you simply need to do
as I ask you.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.118
I'm to be a student
at his school for orphans.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.753
I will see you have
some money for your school.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.621
It will bind us together
in venture.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.390
So be it.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.291
- You have a title!
- I have nothing.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.327
The Comte de Valmont wins!

00:26.327 --> 00:29.330
That's why I need you to use
your exemplary skills of deceit

00:29.330 --> 00:31.732
<i>draw out the truth about
how this false vicomtesse</i>

00:31.732 --> 00:34.235
made a puppet of my father
to disinherit me.

00:34.235 --> 00:36.771
From where may you
have heard of Ariadne?

00:36.771 --> 00:39.206
There's a private club.
It's called the Labyrinth.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.374
I know Jean's secret.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.542
<i>I know what Ariadne means.</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:42.810
<i>The Marquis can do</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:44.378
<i>whatever he wants
without consequence.</i>

00:44.378 --> 00:46.046
<i>Where is he?</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:47.381
<i>Gone to his engagement party.</i>

00:47.381 --> 00:48.516
<i>The games are over.</i>

00:48.516 --> 00:50.251
Change is coming here.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.286
<i>And he left instruction for me</i>

00:52.286 --> 00:54.422
<i>to ensure that
you left this house.</i>

00:54.422 --> 00:57.258
You can't win against
that sort of power.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.193
You don't know me, Majordome.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.302
You cannot mean
to descend upon

01:08.302 --> 01:10.438
<i>Jean's engagement party</i>

01:10.438 --> 01:13.441
when you could
stay here with me.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.642
Hmm.

01:14.642 --> 01:16.610
Perhaps we might even share
this bed tonight.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.314
You sleep in a chair
beside the fire,

01:20.314 --> 01:21.482
and now you bring me coffee.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.484
I had no idea
you were such a gentleman.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.252
Oh, I'm not.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.822
You don't seriously mean
to go to Rambouillet?

01:27.822 --> 01:30.758
They will serve you up
alongside the boar.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.427
- You've been there?
- Often.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.397
With a friend. A composer.
The Sevignys were his patrons.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.634
Yet you're not invited
to the engagement party.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.171
My stepmother poisoned
that particular well.

01:44.171 --> 01:47.174
She's never so happy as when
she's dispelling the affection

01:47.174 --> 01:48.843
that others hold me in.

01:48.843 --> 01:50.344
<i>Don't forget your promise
to help me</i>

01:50.344 --> 01:52.313
get back what she stole
from me.

01:52.313 --> 01:55.449
Perhaps you should focus
on completing your own task.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.184
<i>Well, love cannot be rushed.</i>

01:57.184 --> 01:59.720
You were cursed the day
you made it your condition.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.288
I won't.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.695
Tell me how to get
to Rambouillet.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.834
I hope we're not so late
we've missed all the fun.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.604
We were not expecting further
guests here, mademoiselle.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.547
I'm a surprise.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.512
Ahh!

04:05.512 --> 04:08.349
Yah!

04:08.349 --> 04:09.583
<i>♪ Beware, beware ♪</i>

04:09.583 --> 04:12.853
Chase, chase, chase, chase!

04:12.853 --> 04:14.822
<i>Who have you caught, Marquis?</i>

04:14.822 --> 04:16.657
<i>And if you take my advice,</i>

04:16.657 --> 04:18.926
be careful with your answer,
lest you offend.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.798
Mmm! Tuberose...

04:24.798 --> 04:26.533
...and ambergris.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.703
A woman of great taste
and beauty.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.338
The Comtesse de Segur!

04:32.406 --> 04:34.541
She's twice my age.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.543
- How dare you?
- Oh!

04:55.596 --> 04:58.565
<i>Where's he going?</i>

05:00.401 --> 05:01.902
Aha!

05:04.571 --> 05:07.775
Such a delicate frame

05:07.775 --> 05:09.777
and skin.

05:09.777 --> 05:13.047
It can only be my future wife.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.948
Ariadne is here.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.590
Did you really think
I would just disappear?

05:23.590 --> 05:25.059
Yes.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.635
Along with your
willful misrepresentation

05:34.635 --> 05:37.371
of my wife's letter to me.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.706
A pity to travel so far

05:38.706 --> 05:41.909
to be spectacle
of your own humiliation.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.877
Ariadne means nothing.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.646
I've been to the Labyrinth.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.718
Ariadne means a great deal.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.119
Though to be sure, shall I ask

05:52.352 --> 05:54.788
your wife-to-be
and all the guests?

06:00.360 --> 06:01.895
Because of grief,
I have not treated you

06:01.895 --> 06:03.931
with the tenderness
you deserve.

06:03.931 --> 06:07.067
You should not have
borne my suffering.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.404
Or the dismissal
of your wife's wishes for me.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.539
Remind me.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.041
That I receive
a generous settlement

06:14.041 --> 06:16.744
so that I may
live independently,

06:16.744 --> 06:19.913
but under the protection
of the Merteuil name.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.517
Ah. Christine!

06:26.520 --> 06:28.021
I will have my lawyer
come in the morning

06:28.021 --> 06:29.923
with a contract
and some monies.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.525
Have him come tonight.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.594
Oh, a contract
and a large sum of money

06:33.594 --> 06:36.964
are more than a day's work.

06:36.964 --> 06:40.834
Besides, you are my guest here.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.069
Do have fun.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.608
Oh, Camille!

06:47.608 --> 06:49.777
Oh, it's such a joy
to have you here.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.578
Jean said you'd returned
to Carcassonne?

06:51.578 --> 06:53.714
I wouldn't miss this weekend.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.516
Aw!

06:59.019 --> 07:01.922
Madame, find Camille a room.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.798
Put her in the north room.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.466
Do not unpack.

07:12.466 --> 07:15.135
It will save your maid time
in the morning when you leave.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.680
That went well.

07:32.853 --> 07:36.990
Madame de Montrachet,
it is good to see you.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.193
You've taken on this boy.

07:39.193 --> 07:41.795
Until we establish
the orphanage.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.832
Save the young,
we save us all.

07:44.832 --> 07:45.866
Come.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.210
Madame, you came!

07:56.210 --> 07:58.212
Hello!

08:05.586 --> 08:07.988
Good to see you again,
monsieur, madame.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.890
<i>I hope you do not mind.
I brought a friend with me.</i>

08:09.890 --> 08:11.258
Monsieur Lucienne.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.126
Any friend's
welcome here, madame.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.562
Oh, my little ones.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.498
I've missed you.
Jessamine, you've grown.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.935
<i>I'm sure of it.
Is that another tooth gone?</i>

08:21.935 --> 08:24.204
I shall give you silver for it.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.673
Monsieur Lucienne,
would you bring my basket?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.876
Monsieur Lucienne?

08:28.876 --> 08:30.244
My basket?

08:36.817 --> 08:38.652
Thank you.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.543
Forgive me. I cannot stay.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.549
Excuse me.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.828
Monsieur Lucienne?
What on Earth has happened?

09:24.932 --> 09:27.334
I suffered a memory of sorts.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.838
I prefer not to think of it.
It brings me great pain.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.257
Come in.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.771
<i>Now, what happened?</i>

10:07.040 --> 10:08.141
Please tell me.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.913
<i>I've let my own pain
consume me.</i>

10:14.147 --> 10:16.249
It has stopped me
from doing my work.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.922
<i>The girl who threw the blood.</i>

10:21.922 --> 10:24.758
<i>I haven't given alms since.</i>

10:24.758 --> 10:27.060
Until today.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.396
A random act should not
prevent such goodness.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.732
<i>It was not random.</i>

10:31.732 --> 10:34.701
Though my husband thinks she's
a figment of my imagination.

10:34.701 --> 10:35.902
<i>He is wrong.</i>

10:40.941 --> 10:42.909
Five years ago,
she was my servant.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.080
Though I treated her
as a daughter.

10:54.187 --> 10:57.024
A daughter would not behave
in such a way.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.929
The girl full of violent
thought and jealousy could.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.868
<i>This girl repaid my trust
and my affection</i>

11:07.868 --> 11:10.370
by attempting to take
everything that mattered to me.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.710
I do not understand.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.080
She tried to take my husband.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.118
<i>She tried to destroy
my marriage,</i>

11:25.118 --> 11:29.256
and when that failed,
she cut her wrists before me.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.799
<i>Her name is Camille.</i>

11:40.233 --> 11:41.935
She's a scar upon me.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.446
I make an incision
on the anterior aspect

11:52.446 --> 11:55.282
<i>of the throat
to locate the tumor.</i>

12:01.822 --> 12:04.858
As soon as ligation
of the superior thyroid artery

12:04.858 --> 12:06.226
<i>is achieved...</i>

12:10.931 --> 12:12.833
<i>...there is a whole new vista.</i>

12:14.134 --> 12:16.236
It could have easily
been removed,

12:16.236 --> 12:17.771
and he would have lived.

12:17.771 --> 12:21.475
But some still do not trust
the knowledge in medicine.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.246
I hope rationality

12:26.246 --> 12:29.516
will eventually
banish fear and superstition.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.519
You speak of rationality,

12:32.752 --> 12:35.755
yet it is true
you search for the soul?

12:35.755 --> 12:38.758
It is a personal quest. Yes.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.393
<i>Why do you believe
the soul resides in there,</i>

12:40.393 --> 12:42.062
Monsieur de Montrachet?

12:45.398 --> 12:49.002
I am drawn
by the heart's power.

12:49.002 --> 12:53.173
Its undulations are,
at once, violent and graceful.

12:53.173 --> 12:56.243
The perfect description of us,
do you not think?

12:56.243 --> 12:59.112
<i>And the perfect dwelling place
for the soul.</i>

12:59.112 --> 13:00.347
Thank you.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.331
<i>Monsieur?</i>

13:18.331 --> 13:19.432
My time is limited,
I'm afraid.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.401
I do not speak with the public.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.536
No, I-I'm an officer

13:22.536 --> 13:23.937
with the Unit
of Moral Discipline.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.806
I'm here on business.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.042
This was...

13:29.042 --> 13:32.179
retrieved from a
dead woman's throat.

13:32.179 --> 13:35.048
Is it possible
it could have caused her death?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.952
It could cause asphyxiation.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.388
Would such a death be painful?

13:41.388 --> 13:42.889
<i>It would be slow,</i>

13:42.889 --> 13:45.859
but the patient would have
no strength to struggle.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.161
Hmm.

13:51.097 --> 13:54.134
I have seen this thread before.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.604
In a corpse I used
in an anatomy class.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.241
- Who was she?
- Ariadne.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.976
We name all our corpses.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.912
Ariadne?

14:07.581 --> 14:09.549
You don't know
your Greek myths.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.918
<i>Ariadne gave Theseus
a skein of red thread</i>

14:11.918 --> 14:13.887
<i>so he could kill the monster
in the maze</i>

14:13.887 --> 14:15.288
and find his way back to her.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.327
I'm impressed, monsieur.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.330
Few would go to such lengths
to investigate,

14:23.330 --> 14:27.601
especially with such
an impediment... as that.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.472
Do you experience
sensation in it?

14:36.076 --> 14:38.111
- I could remove it...
- Um...

14:38.111 --> 14:39.312
<i>With minimal risk
and discomfort.</i>

14:39.312 --> 14:41.414
I'm working, sir.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.483
Do you know who I am?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.619
What I am offering you?

14:45.619 --> 14:48.321
A limb such as this
is of no use.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.056
A burden, surely.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.891
Actually, it is not.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.560
<i>Everything is harder.</i>

14:53.560 --> 14:56.229
Takes more time, more effort,

14:56.229 --> 15:00.200
but that is why I detect things
that others miss.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.202
It is why I'm good at my job.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.271
But the superstitious
among us maintain

15:04.271 --> 15:07.040
the left hand
represents the devil.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.145
My hand is not to be removed.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.949
Thank you for your time, monsieur.

15:56.623 --> 16:01.094
<i>L'amour ♪</i>

16:03.596 --> 16:06.066
- Bravo!
- My darling!

16:06.066 --> 16:08.468
<i>Oh, my darling!</i>

16:08.468 --> 16:11.204
Oh, this weekend
is one of celebration,

16:11.204 --> 16:15.008
and we are honored
by the presence

16:15.008 --> 16:18.478
of the Princesse de Lamballe,

16:18.478 --> 16:22.449
who comes to us with blessings
from our queen

16:22.449 --> 16:24.417
for this noble match.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.056
These jewels are from
Her Majesty's collection

16:30.056 --> 16:34.227
and are a gift to you
in recognition of her pleasure

16:34.227 --> 16:39.232
at two families beloved
by the court joining in union.

16:50.610 --> 16:54.447
Toast with me
our cherished daughter,

16:54.447 --> 16:56.349
the future marquise,

16:56.349 --> 17:00.320
and her husband-to-be,
the Marquis de Merteuil.

17:05.058 --> 17:09.095
The loss of Geneviève
has been hard to bear,

17:09.095 --> 17:11.464
<i>but I know she blesses
this union.</i>

17:11.464 --> 17:16.102
To love and marriage.

17:18.638 --> 17:22.609
The title of marquise
is wasted on that child.

17:22.609 --> 17:25.311
Far better it sit with me.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.814
You cannot hope to make
a match with Jean.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.218
Help me, and I'll help you.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.320
Help you how?

17:34.320 --> 17:37.724
I've seen an enmity
between you and Christine.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.393
There will be no welcome
for you at Saint-Honoré

17:40.393 --> 17:43.296
when her daughter's marquise.

17:43.296 --> 17:48.301
But with me at Jean's side,
you will be championed

17:48.301 --> 17:51.171
and treasured like a daughter.

17:51.171 --> 17:54.574
- Because you are so maternal.
- My son is my god.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.378
And your stepson Pascal?

17:58.378 --> 18:01.681
I heard something
about a feud between you.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.617
He is a story for another night
and a bottle of brandy.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.832
It's not my choice.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.701
Please believe me.

18:21.701 --> 18:25.271
Mama has arranged all of it.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.240
I cannot bear life without you.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.877
Danceny?

18:31.110 --> 18:32.445
Perhaps you would like
to concentrate

18:32.445 --> 18:33.713
on your harpsichord?

18:38.685 --> 18:42.388
Do not forget your marquis,
my love.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.236
And how is Her Royal Highness,
our queen?

18:56.236 --> 18:57.904
Sad she cannot join you

18:58.137 --> 19:02.175
but glad
I am the envoy of her love.

19:02.175 --> 19:05.445
She kissed my hand
so that you might kiss it

19:05.445 --> 19:07.747
and receive the kiss
she has left for you.

19:07.747 --> 19:10.817
Send this kiss back
to dear Marietta.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.890
With my love.

19:19.359 --> 19:23.696
Tonight, let us dance
the dance loved by our queen

19:23.696 --> 19:28.401
and all of us of noble birth.

19:28.401 --> 19:31.471
The contra dance allemande!

19:41.881 --> 19:45.418
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
- I do not dance, monsieur.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.921
<i>Cannot</i> I would imagine
is more accurate.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.956
Do as I do, mademoiselle, hmm?

20:10.877 --> 20:13.713
Inviting that fraud
to stay is hardly the behavior

20:13.713 --> 20:15.848
of a man who wants her gone.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.550
This is your house, madame.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.686
I've already thrown her
out of mine.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.454
When one buys the gun,

20:21.454 --> 20:24.857
one surely need not
fire it too.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.659
<i>I hope you show more backbone</i>

20:26.659 --> 20:28.561
in marriage to my daughter.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.729
Let's not pretend
this marriage

20:29.729 --> 20:32.732
has anything to do
with my backbone.

21:17.944 --> 21:21.681
Your beauty is the one
thing he does not exaggerate.

21:24.350 --> 21:26.586
Valmont.

21:26.586 --> 21:30.923
I'm to be a friend,
should you need one, hmm?

21:30.923 --> 21:34.394
He waits for you
in the summer house.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.837
Don't wait up for me.
I need to get some fresh air.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.339
Camille--

21:50.977 --> 21:52.745
Hors d'oeuvres
are for the guests.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.016
For your mistress.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.385
An inventory of everything
in your rooms.

21:59.385 --> 22:01.454
Be sure it is all there
when you depart,

22:01.454 --> 22:03.056
first thing tomorrow.

22:19.405 --> 22:22.642
I like your chevalier.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.043
I like you better.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.847
I missed you.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.519
I love you.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.491
I said I love you!

22:39.859 --> 22:42.528
I have my carriage.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.031
Come with me.

22:45.031 --> 22:48.534
I cannot. Let's stay here.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.404
Why will you not come?

22:51.404 --> 22:52.939
Because I have succeeded
with Jean.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.574
Your blackmail.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.411
He will be my guardian.

22:58.411 --> 23:01.881
I will have his name,

23:01.881 --> 23:05.118
<i>and there will be money too.</i>

23:05.118 --> 23:08.688
<i>I'll buy a great house
for us.</i>

23:08.688 --> 23:11.591
Only I must stay another day
to do so.

23:13.459 --> 23:15.528
You're good at getting
what you want.

23:15.528 --> 23:18.097
Getting what I'm due.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.599
<i>Valmont!</i>

23:21.467 --> 23:23.903
Valmont, what's wrong?

23:30.676 --> 23:33.813
You asked me to seduce
this woman,

23:33.813 --> 23:37.483
yet you give me
no proof of her wrong,

23:37.483 --> 23:39.719
despite the bloody evidence
of what you're capable of.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.554
What I'm capable of?

23:45.491 --> 23:47.059
So it's true.

23:49.862 --> 23:54.167
You are the proof...
of her suffering.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.004
You make a fool of me.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.909
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

24:02.909 --> 24:04.443
What has she said to you?

24:04.443 --> 24:06.612
Tell me,
or I will go no further.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.114
What has she told you?

24:08.114 --> 24:11.784
She doesn't matter.

24:11.784 --> 24:15.588
I want the truth from you.

24:15.588 --> 24:18.825
I have given it.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.627
She took everything
that mattered from me.

24:21.627 --> 24:25.798
Oh, I see it
with my own eyes, Camille.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.900
The scars of what you did

24:27.900 --> 24:31.137
because you could not get
what you wanted.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.239
And me.

24:33.472 --> 24:37.610
The willing fool who ruins her
so you may finally be with him

24:37.610 --> 24:41.581
because you want him still.

24:41.581 --> 24:43.883
My God, Camille.

24:46.085 --> 24:49.188
All of this,
so you can take her husband.

24:52.225 --> 24:54.827
You know nothing, Valmont.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.996
Hmm.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.197
Nothing!

25:03.002 --> 25:04.937
<i>I don't want
to know any more.</i>

25:10.243 --> 25:12.245
Valmont!

25:12.245 --> 25:14.614
Don't walk away from me.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.070
You want to help me after all.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.975
No, Vicomtesse.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.677
I want to get
very, very drunk with you.

26:55.681 --> 26:57.917
Your stepson.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.720
What did he do
to make an enemy of you?

27:02.321 --> 27:04.991
He told lies about me
to his father.

27:08.761 --> 27:09.862
I hate him.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.065
For you.

27:15.001 --> 27:16.202
For his disloyalty.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.170
For the stories he told.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.739
For the damage he's done.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.879
He's caused much damage.

27:29.915 --> 27:33.986
The Comtesse de Sevigny and I
were once close

27:33.986 --> 27:36.989
until I discovered the liaisons
between the two of them.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.396
Christine is old enough
to be his mother.

27:43.396 --> 27:47.199
That's why I'm invited
to everything.

27:47.199 --> 27:51.804
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

27:51.804 --> 27:53.906
Then I'm glad
you make him suffer.

28:03.716 --> 28:06.252
Azolan.

28:06.252 --> 28:07.720
Who am I?

28:09.989 --> 28:12.124
Pardon?

28:12.124 --> 28:14.727
Am I Valmont pretending
to be Lucienne...

28:18.164 --> 28:21.033
...or am I Lucienne
pretending to be Valmont?

28:23.302 --> 28:26.038
Well, who do you want to be?

28:26.038 --> 28:27.373
A good man.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.320
I don't want to hurt someone...

28:46.792 --> 28:48.994
...who should not be hurt.

29:02.141 --> 29:06.412
Tell Madame de Montrachet
the truth about your mother.

29:06.412 --> 29:09.748
You can't get
more honest than that.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.952
There's pain
in sharing that truth, Azolan.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.421
I'm not sure I'm brave enough.

29:22.161 --> 29:26.031
Yesterday, when we gave alms,

29:26.031 --> 29:28.534
and I left you,

29:28.767 --> 29:30.136
it's because I heard a scream.

29:30.136 --> 29:33.038
Bloodcurdling.

29:33.038 --> 29:34.273
A child's scream.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.242
No, Lucienne.
I would have heard.

29:36.242 --> 29:39.512
You could not have,

29:39.512 --> 29:42.148
for it was in my head.

29:42.148 --> 29:45.151
It was my scream

29:45.151 --> 29:46.819
from when I was a child.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.257
A kindness.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.559
The act of giving alms.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.532
It reminded me of the day
my mother died.

30:02.268 --> 30:05.171
A lunatic slit her throat
while she was giving alms.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.545
I saw it happen.

30:17.116 --> 30:20.252
All her blood emptied out
like wine into the snow.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.158
I was too small
to get out of the carriage.

30:30.229 --> 30:33.399
I used to wake up...

30:33.399 --> 30:36.035
screaming for her.

30:36.035 --> 30:40.139
<i>No!</i> Maman! Maman!

30:40.139 --> 30:42.575
I don't talk about
this pain inside me.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.479
I want you to know me.

31:01.060 --> 31:05.898
Jacqueline, please.
I don't want you to go.

31:05.898 --> 31:08.067
I cannot possibly stay.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.468
Not now.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.459
Of course,
losing Gustav was such agony.

31:36.028 --> 31:38.998
Do you care for dogs, Jean?

31:38.998 --> 31:41.433
No.

31:41.433 --> 31:44.169
It seems I am
to join the hunt, Emilie.

31:44.169 --> 31:46.972
Oh, Camille.

31:46.972 --> 31:49.541
May I confide in you?

31:49.541 --> 31:53.045
Yes. Yes, of course.

31:53.045 --> 31:54.246
He thinks I do not notice,

31:54.246 --> 31:56.582
but every time I speak,
Jean seems to wince.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.186
If he winces, he's a fool.

32:06.158 --> 32:09.928
But if you love someone else,
you should tell your mother.

32:12.197 --> 32:15.367
Your secret's safe with me, Emilie.

32:15.367 --> 32:17.369
Follow your heart.

32:43.696 --> 32:46.198
He is a fine shot.

32:46.198 --> 32:49.168
Coming from you, Musket,
that is a compliment.

32:49.168 --> 32:53.572
Ma, might I speak with you
for a moment?

32:53.572 --> 32:55.240
Oh, yes.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.347
Though I say the marquis
has a long pistol, that's all.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.415
That is often enough, Chevalier.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.086
I favor technique.

33:07.086 --> 33:10.422
It amounts to the same thing.
The loss of beautiful birds.

33:23.702 --> 33:25.337
<i>From the right, sir!</i>

33:40.152 --> 33:41.754
Where is your lawyer, Jean?

33:41.754 --> 33:43.522
He'll be here soon.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.291
I do hope you stay around
to meet him.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.460
What do you mean, Jean?

33:48.460 --> 33:52.731
Camille, let me teach you
how to shoot.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.767
A parting gift.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.502
Very well, a skill to protect

33:56.502 --> 33:58.604
against assassins
may prove invaluable.

33:58.604 --> 34:02.141
That depends how many
assassins there are.

34:04.643 --> 34:08.480
With a gun like this,
you have but one shot.

34:12.751 --> 34:15.554
If you are hunting
something dangerous,

34:15.554 --> 34:19.324
be sure to finish it off,
or much like a wounded enemy,

34:19.324 --> 34:22.094
it will do you more damage.
Do you understand?

34:22.094 --> 34:25.431
- That you seek to threaten me.
- Oh, it's not a threat.

34:38.710 --> 34:42.214
You want to know why
they call me Musket?

34:42.214 --> 34:44.249
Because I never miss.

34:46.351 --> 34:49.121
I will not tolerate you
in my house

34:49.121 --> 34:53.659
or your attempts to unsettle
my daughter a moment longer.

34:53.659 --> 34:57.496
If she is unsettled, perhaps
you should ask yourself why.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.131
I have done nothing
but listen to her.

34:59.131 --> 35:02.434
Little more, and you'll curse
the day you ever came here.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.736
You have no idea what a mother
will do for her child.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.539
I am here
by the marquis' invitation.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.308
Invitation withdrawn.

35:11.610 --> 35:15.280
From the marquis
via his messenger, me.

35:17.382 --> 35:21.820
Leave my house,
or the next shot is you.

35:49.314 --> 35:52.918
There has to be
a letter from Christine here.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.353
I must have missed it.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.321
These people mean
to do you harm.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.723
It scares me
that you can't see that.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.191
I see it.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.626
I mean to make them pay.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.602
"What an explosion
that night between us

36:10.602 --> 36:13.505
"when we both went off
with such a bang.

36:13.505 --> 36:16.341
"How exquisitely
you pulled the trigger.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.409
Your M."

36:17.409 --> 36:19.177
The alphabet has changed.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.879
Christine begins with M.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.783
Musket begins with M.

36:24.783 --> 36:27.519
She wrote the inventory.
Now, let's see.

36:32.824 --> 36:37.462
It is the same hand.
Look. The M.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.969
"Your technique
was a new one to me.

36:44.202 --> 36:47.472
"One I tried later
with my darling Marietta.

36:47.472 --> 36:50.642
"Thank you, dear V,
for your tricks.

36:50.642 --> 36:53.879
She cannot be without me."

36:53.879 --> 36:55.247
Marietta is the name

36:55.247 --> 36:57.783
I heard Christine whisper
to the chevalier.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.323
This letter is about her.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.357
Who?

37:08.260 --> 37:09.361
The queen.

37:11.530 --> 37:12.864
Then we must burn it.

37:15.334 --> 37:18.270
Camille, it's a death warrant.

37:18.270 --> 37:19.438
Not only for Christine.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.540
For us,
if we are found with it.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.709
It is my salvation.

37:37.322 --> 37:38.757
Do you still want Jean?

37:41.860 --> 37:43.829
Do I want to marry
a noble of the sword,

37:43.829 --> 37:47.599
France's highest honor,
and gain the title of marquise?

37:47.599 --> 37:50.969
<i>Do I want power,
wealth, status,</i>

37:50.969 --> 37:53.338
and a man with
very little sexual appetite,

37:53.338 --> 37:56.041
if his lack of heirs
is anything to go by?

37:56.274 --> 37:58.276
Yes, Camille.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.811
<i>I still want all of that.</i>

38:02.447 --> 38:05.951
You did not realize
what a catch your guardian is.

38:05.951 --> 38:08.587
And if I could
make him available to you...

38:10.622 --> 38:12.824
...what would you give me?

38:12.824 --> 38:14.593
What do you want?

38:16.561 --> 38:19.364
Enough for a fine house,

38:19.364 --> 38:22.401
your backing in Paris,

38:22.401 --> 38:25.404
and access to all that power
you'll have.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.972
Can you make him available?

38:26.972 --> 38:31.410
I have information
in my possession

38:31.410 --> 38:33.545
that will destroy
the Sevigny name.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.651
Gossip. Not enough.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.486
A letter...

38:42.888 --> 38:44.923
...that incriminates
the writer.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.495
Show me it.

38:59.438 --> 39:01.339
We will have to trust
one another.

39:06.678 --> 39:09.081
That is a deal...

39:09.081 --> 39:11.016
<i>if</i> he becomes mine.

39:12.818 --> 39:16.021
I cannot make a match,

39:16.021 --> 39:18.490
but I can destroy
the one he has.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.895
The rest is down to you.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.435
That innocent heart of yours

39:30.435 --> 39:32.904
is corrupting, Camille.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.909
<i>I'm glad.</i>

39:37.909 --> 39:40.412
There's no power in innocence.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.575
I wish to speak
to you in private.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.817
You and I have nothing
to say to each other

40:18.817 --> 40:21.586
except goodbye.

40:21.586 --> 40:24.990
- The princesse on his right.
- Break the engagement.

40:26.558 --> 40:29.795
Oh, dear.

40:29.795 --> 40:32.597
Have you--have you
lost your mind?

40:32.597 --> 40:34.666
<i>Your daughter
doesn't love the marquis,</i>

40:34.666 --> 40:36.902
and he does not love her.

40:38.503 --> 40:40.071
Leave us.

40:45.677 --> 40:49.514
Marriage is not about love.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.683
<i>It's an alliance.</i>

40:51.683 --> 40:53.585
One that will ensure
my daughter

40:53.585 --> 40:56.555
has everything she deserves.

40:56.555 --> 40:59.157
You've made it
your business to humiliate me.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.594
Now I will return the favor.

41:02.594 --> 41:05.530
I knew you wanted him.

41:05.530 --> 41:08.066
Get out of my house.

41:08.066 --> 41:11.169
I want to talk about the queen.

41:11.169 --> 41:15.707
You are not fit
to speak her name.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.943
Marietta.

41:17.943 --> 41:21.680
Though that is the name
that you save for her alone

41:21.680 --> 41:23.248
when you make love...

41:25.016 --> 41:28.720
...with the secrets
you learned from Valmont.

41:28.720 --> 41:32.657
I have the letter
you wrote him, Comtesse.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.961
If you want it back...

41:35.961 --> 41:38.697
break the engagement.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.599
<i>Then you will have
your letter,</i>

41:40.599 --> 41:44.836
and you can pretend to be
a good wife and mother...

41:44.836 --> 41:46.638
while you fuck our queen.

42:03.588 --> 42:05.023
<i>Jacqueline?</i>

42:14.633 --> 42:16.201
You are, as I hoped,

42:16.201 --> 42:18.203
a man without vanity.

42:20.972 --> 42:23.575
You will take coffee?

42:23.575 --> 42:26.745
I will take wine.

42:26.745 --> 42:29.681
Good.

42:29.681 --> 42:31.049
So will I.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.997
Why did you ask me to come?

42:51.102 --> 42:52.671
When I'm with you...

42:54.940 --> 42:56.975
...I feel like I am
the man I want to be.

42:59.277 --> 43:00.679
A good man.

43:03.949 --> 43:06.184
But you are a good man.

43:06.184 --> 43:09.754
No one has seen that in me.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.690
Not since my mother.

43:19.631 --> 43:21.266
I-I brought you a book.

43:23.868 --> 43:25.236
It's my husband's early work.

43:25.236 --> 43:29.040
Tell me you did not come here
to talk about your husband.

43:29.040 --> 43:32.811
He searches for the soul,
and his work...

43:35.347 --> 43:39.050
...has made me understand
this p--

43:39.050 --> 43:40.885
peculiar feeling that I have.

43:42.387 --> 43:45.757
The fluttering in my chest.

43:45.757 --> 43:48.193
The tightness of the breath.

43:50.095 --> 43:51.262
It is my soul.

43:53.698 --> 43:57.702
And if it is the soul,
then it is of God.

43:57.702 --> 44:00.372
And it cannot be a sin.

44:19.724 --> 44:21.026
I want to be known.

44:21.026 --> 44:23.428
Truly known
within my very soul, monsieur.

44:27.966 --> 44:31.302
I have been alone for so long.

44:31.302 --> 44:32.804
As have I.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.782
Let us pray.

44:46.718 --> 44:47.986
<i>For what?</i>

44:52.791 --> 44:54.826
For the thoughts
I have about you

44:54.826 --> 44:57.996
and upon which
we can never act, can we?

45:36.501 --> 45:38.069
Are you lost, madame?

45:38.069 --> 45:39.370
Absolutely.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.106
I've stumbled
into the wrong room.

45:41.106 --> 45:43.775
I will let
my mistress know you visited

45:43.775 --> 45:45.210
and fell in her trunk.

45:45.210 --> 45:47.879
You need not trouble her
with my silly mistake.

45:47.879 --> 45:51.015
I'll see a pretty dress
and some trinkets, too,

45:51.015 --> 45:54.018
are sent out to you.

45:54.018 --> 45:56.354
We may make something
of you yet.

45:59.090 --> 46:02.760
Camille. How lovely.

46:02.760 --> 46:05.130
<i>I found her
searching through your trunk.</i>

46:05.130 --> 46:08.933
It seems we cannot trust
one another, after all.

46:10.969 --> 46:13.138
Another lesson
in the etiquette of Paris.

46:24.182 --> 46:25.416
<i>You're surprised she wants</i>

46:25.416 --> 46:28.019
<i>the letters for herself?</i>

46:28.019 --> 46:31.356
<i>She took everything
from Valmont.</i>

46:31.356 --> 46:33.158
I never thought I'd pity him.

46:38.930 --> 46:43.334
Stop this, Camille.
You'll destroy both of us.

46:43.334 --> 46:45.236
I am doing this for both of us.

46:48.973 --> 46:50.375
<i>Camille, wait.</i>

46:50.375 --> 46:55.180
Camille, I am sorry for our-our
playful sparring in the past.

46:55.180 --> 46:57.215
It was childish of me, and I--

46:57.215 --> 46:58.349
You tore me apart.

46:58.349 --> 47:01.386
I do not recall it
being playful.

47:01.386 --> 47:04.455
You cannot expect me
to go to the marquis.

47:04.455 --> 47:07.859
What possible reason
would we have to turn him away?

47:07.859 --> 47:09.827
Saving yourself.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.163
Do you not recall
what you wrote about the queen?

47:12.163 --> 47:15.099
I will deny it.

47:15.099 --> 47:16.467
It is in your hand.

47:18.269 --> 47:21.206
If it is a lie,
then it is sedition.

47:21.206 --> 47:25.443
If it is true, then you make
a cuckold of the king.

47:25.443 --> 47:30.081
Tell Jean you will not
let him marry Emilie

47:30.081 --> 47:33.351
because you suspect
that he drove his first wife

47:33.351 --> 47:35.186
to take her own life.

47:37.088 --> 47:41.159
That is why you are
breaking the engagement.

47:41.159 --> 47:43.561
And then tell your guests
the same.

47:58.409 --> 48:00.612
You have a glow about you.

48:00.612 --> 48:02.146
It is good to see.

48:07.018 --> 48:09.053
And you're reading my book.

48:11.222 --> 48:14.392
Well, are you enjoying it?

48:14.392 --> 48:17.528
It is as if I'm learning
what it is to be human.

48:20.465 --> 48:23.268
Perhaps Versailles

48:23.268 --> 48:25.403
will be a chance for us
to start again.

48:27.071 --> 48:29.107
Versailles?

48:29.107 --> 48:30.942
It is not yet announced,
but I am about

48:30.942 --> 48:33.478
to become the most
powerful surgeon in France.

48:33.478 --> 48:35.046
Physician to the king.

48:38.283 --> 48:41.319
So we will leave Paris

48:41.319 --> 48:43.388
and all the nightmares
you've had here...

48:46.424 --> 48:49.160
...and start again together.

48:54.132 --> 48:55.633
When will we leave?

48:57.368 --> 48:59.203
When the king commands me.

49:11.282 --> 49:12.450
<i>I cannot risk her reputation--</i>

49:12.450 --> 49:14.118
<i>It is a vicious lie!</i>

49:14.118 --> 49:15.353
<i>There's nothing
more to say, Jean.</i>

49:15.353 --> 49:16.988
<i>Get out!</i>

49:31.069 --> 49:32.537
I said I want to be alone.

49:32.537 --> 49:35.239
It is not good to be alone
when you are suffering.

49:37.742 --> 49:39.644
Humiliated.

49:44.449 --> 49:48.453
I know what the comtesse
has done to you.

49:48.453 --> 49:50.288
How could you know that?

49:52.523 --> 49:54.292
Perhaps you underestimate

49:54.292 --> 49:56.527
all women, Marquis.

49:56.527 --> 49:59.764
Through the Labyrinth
you have spun a web

49:59.997 --> 50:03.000
to draw out the secrets of men,

50:03.000 --> 50:04.769
but men never have
as much to lose

50:05.002 --> 50:07.238
as a woman with a secret.

50:07.238 --> 50:09.741
They are not burdened
by the same shame

50:09.741 --> 50:13.511
that drives a woman
to do anything to save herself.

50:19.484 --> 50:22.653
You've been looking in the
wrong place for your power.

50:25.323 --> 50:27.291
The lies
and the secrets of women.

50:29.794 --> 50:33.431
So let us come to new terms,
and I will save you.

50:33.431 --> 50:36.701
The country air
has unbalanced you.

50:36.701 --> 50:39.237
I don't need saving.

50:39.237 --> 50:41.672
<i>Your guests
are gathering downstairs.</i>

50:41.672 --> 50:45.476
The comtesse is about
to humiliate you further.

50:45.476 --> 50:48.379
<i>She's going to tell them
she called off the engagement</i>

50:48.379 --> 50:52.617
because you drove the marquise
to her death.

50:52.617 --> 50:54.218
<i>How do I know this?</i>

50:56.087 --> 50:58.556
Because it is
by my instruction.

50:58.556 --> 51:03.060
You do not have
the power to instruct!

51:04.495 --> 51:06.464
I am the most
powerful person in this house.

51:06.464 --> 51:07.498
Ha!

51:09.667 --> 51:12.837
I have the comtesse's secrets
written in this letter.

51:13.070 --> 51:16.574
Secrets so dangerous she will
do whatever I tell her to do

51:16.574 --> 51:18.476
to have it back.

51:22.613 --> 51:27.418
This letter, in your hands,
could also save you...

51:29.187 --> 51:31.122
...if I were to give it to you.

51:39.831 --> 51:43.568
I show you what is possible
by a union between us.

51:45.536 --> 51:46.537
Everything.

51:48.573 --> 51:49.607
<i>Everything.</i>

51:53.744 --> 51:55.446
Emilie is a child.

51:55.446 --> 51:57.381
You should marry your equal.

52:00.251 --> 52:01.752
You should marry me.

52:08.326 --> 52:10.828
Christine,
the princesse is waiting.

52:10.828 --> 52:12.363
I know.

52:17.902 --> 52:22.406
I've never doubted you
for one moment, my love.

52:22.406 --> 52:24.842
All that matters is our family.

52:24.842 --> 52:27.478
I heard the comtesse say
that Jean de Merteuil

52:27.478 --> 52:29.680
is unfit for marriage.

52:29.680 --> 52:33.651
That he drove Geneviève
to her death.

52:42.627 --> 52:45.897
- Come with me.
- What? What is it?

52:45.897 --> 52:47.932
Leave this to me.

52:55.206 --> 52:57.909
- Come. We're leaving now.
- And miss this?

52:57.909 --> 53:00.478
The marquis is going to get
what he deserves.

53:00.478 --> 53:02.513
Victoire, let us go.

53:05.750 --> 53:09.387
There is gossip circulating
about the marquis.

53:09.387 --> 53:11.589
If it is true, you must put
a stop to this marriage

53:11.589 --> 53:14.191
before your own good name
is drawn into disrepute.

53:33.511 --> 53:38.249
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our honored guests, please.</i>

53:39.850 --> 53:42.887
I'm so dreadfully sorry,

53:42.887 --> 53:44.956
but we have
received information

53:44.956 --> 53:47.725
which means the marriage
of our daughter

53:47.725 --> 53:51.395
<i>to the Marquis de Merteuil
cannot take place.</i>

53:52.897 --> 53:57.768
It would be disrespectful
to discuss it further.

53:57.768 --> 53:59.403
<i>Disrespectful?</i>

53:59.403 --> 54:01.405
It is disrespectful to Emilie

54:01.405 --> 54:03.708
that a man who drove
his first wife to her death

54:03.708 --> 54:06.344
should dare to take a second
as innocent as her.

54:14.552 --> 54:17.021
<i>Though I enjoy a good
story as much as the next man,</i>

54:17.254 --> 54:19.757
I'm compelled
to speak the truth.

54:19.757 --> 54:23.728
A truth which may be at odds
with what you've heard.

54:23.728 --> 54:26.297
<i>Forgive me,
Madame de la Princesse,</i>

54:26.297 --> 54:27.965
but a letter written
by the comtesse

54:27.965 --> 54:29.467
has come into my possession.

54:29.467 --> 54:32.837
Be silent, sir!
You are in my house.

54:32.837 --> 54:35.673
I am in your wife's house, sir,

54:35.673 --> 54:39.410
and it appears that you are
only a guest here too.

54:39.410 --> 54:41.812
<i>In the faithless poison
of her ink,</i>

54:41.812 --> 54:44.749
Musket makes a fool of you
and libels

54:44.749 --> 54:47.952
the very heart of this monarchy
with her immorality.

54:47.952 --> 54:49.820
That is not true!
It is not true!

54:49.820 --> 54:54.425
My wife knows only faith,
devotion, and-and motherhood.

54:57.695 --> 55:00.364
This marriage will not
take place

55:00.364 --> 55:03.434
because I will not join
my house to a corrupted one.

55:08.973 --> 55:11.676
The proof, if it's needed.

55:11.676 --> 55:13.678
What have you done, Camille?

55:13.678 --> 55:15.513
I made us safe.

55:43.474 --> 55:45.476
You fall by your own hand.

55:57.388 --> 55:58.489
Not true.

56:02.793 --> 56:04.395
Not true.

56:30.588 --> 56:35.559
Marquis, let us take some air.

56:35.559 --> 56:37.561
Walk together.

56:37.561 --> 56:40.798
I will save you the trouble
of pursuing me, Widow Valmont.

56:40.798 --> 56:43.768
I knew your late husband,
and I assure you,

56:43.768 --> 56:46.170
death was a comfort to him.

56:59.517 --> 57:03.587
I promised you an equal.

57:03.587 --> 57:04.655
Here I am.

57:06.991 --> 57:09.727
If I am equal to the carnage
you have wrought,

57:09.727 --> 57:12.429
the world should be afraid
of us both.
