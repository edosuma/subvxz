<i>Why is my signature</i>
<i>on these documents?</i>

00:04.353 --> 00:06.704
Honey, you empowered us
to do this.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.071
No, I empowered you

00:08.157 --> 00:10.625
to pick a cover model
for the magazine,

00:10.692 --> 00:12.327
not to send me
to prison.

00:12.378 --> 00:13.693
This is not my fault!

00:15.364 --> 00:16.664
Clay, what's happening?
It's my fault.

00:16.715 --> 00:17.999
Two victims,
both critical, coming in.

00:18.067 --> 00:20.218
Victim number one -- male.
Estimated mid-20s.

00:20.302 --> 00:21.469
Haley!

00:21.536 --> 00:23.871
She can't see me.
<i>I</i> can.

00:26.308 --> 00:27.475
I want to stay
with you.

00:27.542 --> 00:28.676
And I want that,
but you can't.

00:28.727 --> 00:29.677
Why?!

00:29.728 --> 00:31.312
Haley's pregnant.

00:31.380 --> 00:33.231
She can't lose you
right now.

00:33.315 --> 00:35.767
Promise me
you'll open your eyes.
I promise.

00:35.851 --> 00:38.419
Till kingdom come.
Till kingdom come.

00:38.487 --> 00:40.154
Now open your eyes.

00:42.491 --> 00:45.460
"Dear, Lucas.

00:45.527 --> 00:49.947
"I feel <i>so</i> lucky
that Quinn is getting better.

00:50.032 --> 00:52.950
"It means I can breathe again.

00:53.035 --> 00:54.952
"The darkness
that I've struggled with

00:55.037 --> 00:58.289
"now seems a world away,
replaced by my concern for her.

01:01.076 --> 01:02.927
"I made a promise
that if she was okay,

01:03.012 --> 01:05.713
"I would try to give back.

01:05.764 --> 01:07.581
"I thought I might
volunteer somewhere

01:07.633 --> 01:10.418
"and try to help people who have
struggled with depression

01:10.469 --> 01:14.772
"or who have faced a crisis
of their own.

01:14.857 --> 01:17.108
"She's been recovering
for about a week,

01:17.192 --> 01:19.093
"and the entire family
was here.

01:19.144 --> 01:21.896
"But now they've gone,
and it's just me and Quinn.

01:21.947 --> 01:24.598
"Every day
brings another small victory,

01:24.650 --> 01:27.902
"and with it, the hope
that Clay wakes up soon.

01:29.771 --> 01:31.906
"With nba training camps
now a week old,

01:31.957 --> 01:33.607
"exhibition games
will begin soon.

01:33.659 --> 01:36.294
"Rosters will be trimmed
to the mandatory 13 players,

01:36.378 --> 01:38.112
"and dreams will come true

of Joe Turner."

01:47.840 --> 01:50.291
You hear that, Buddy?

01:50.342 --> 01:53.594
You're the badass
that made that happen.

01:53.645 --> 01:55.463
You can do this, Clay.

01:55.514 --> 01:57.815
Believe that.

02:01.970 --> 02:03.421
"Closed over bros.

02:03.489 --> 02:05.423

02:05.491 --> 02:08.025

02:08.110 --> 02:09.977
We'll skip that one.

02:11.864 --> 02:14.332
Thanks.

02:14.416 --> 02:16.501
Good morning, daughter.

02:16.585 --> 02:19.253
If you're spelling morn
"m-o-u-r-n."

02:19.321 --> 02:20.922
Always with the drama.

02:20.989 --> 02:24.092
Let's see if we can
turn that frown upside down.

02:24.159 --> 02:25.760
Your problems are over.

02:25.827 --> 02:27.211
What do you mean?

02:27.296 --> 02:30.681
I mean that our attorneys have
spoken with their attorneys

02:30.766 --> 02:32.767
who've spoken with
half of the federal government,

02:32.834 --> 02:34.185
and we've reached
an agreement.

02:34.269 --> 02:37.188
We will pay a fine,
we'll restructure,

02:37.272 --> 02:38.773
we'll get
a slap on the wrist,

02:38.840 --> 02:40.308
and you will
keep your company.

02:40.359 --> 02:41.909
And your freedom.

02:41.977 --> 02:43.811
But how?

02:43.862 --> 02:45.113
Let's just say

02:45.180 --> 02:48.316
that I've always had
your best interests at heart,

02:48.367 --> 02:49.433
and I still do.

02:49.501 --> 02:52.453
So breathe.

02:52.521 --> 02:55.239
And, uh, don't eat that.

02:55.324 --> 02:57.291
You're gonna be
just fine.

02:57.359 --> 02:59.293
I can't believe it.

02:59.361 --> 03:01.329
What, no "thank you"?

03:01.380 --> 03:03.748
Thank you?

03:03.832 --> 03:08.052
You want a "thank you"
for getting me into this mess?

03:08.137 --> 03:11.305
No. I want a "thank you"
for getting you <i>out</i> of it.

03:11.373 --> 03:12.924
How 'bout
a "you're fired"?

03:13.008 --> 03:14.509
You want one of those,
too?

03:16.878 --> 03:19.180
No thank you necessary.

03:19.231 --> 03:22.967

to what you might think,

could talk to you for a second.

Hi.

05:55.470 --> 05:57.972
Quinn's really broken up
about Clay,

05:58.039 --> 06:00.057
and Jamie
is getting worried,

06:00.142 --> 06:02.376
and I was just hoping you guys
could take him for the day.

06:02.427 --> 06:04.095
Absolutely.
Thank you.

06:04.179 --> 06:05.179

06:16.575 --> 06:18.576
I think
it's gonna be okay.

06:18.660 --> 06:20.194
Wow.
That's great, Brooke.

06:20.245 --> 06:22.029
Hey, mouth and Millie
send their best.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.897
They just didn't want
to be in the way.

06:23.949 --> 06:25.750
Of course.
Are they back together?

06:25.834 --> 06:27.702
No.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.821

06:30.889 --> 06:31.972

06:33.692 --> 06:35.943

06:38.964 --> 06:41.215
So...
What's your day like?

06:41.266 --> 06:43.200
Oh,
same day as yesterday.

06:43.268 --> 06:46.170
Pretty much deal with the fact
that I got Brooke arrested

06:46.238 --> 06:48.923
and almost
lost the company.

06:48.990 --> 06:50.307
You?

06:50.392 --> 06:52.259
Oh, same as yesterday.

06:52.310 --> 06:55.596
Pretty much...Nothing.

06:58.099 --> 07:00.534
So, I guess last night
we must have...

07:00.602 --> 07:01.819
Yeah.

07:01.887 --> 07:04.739
Yeah, I guess so.

07:04.806 --> 07:08.376
We should
probably get up.

07:11.129 --> 07:13.080

07:13.131 --> 07:14.465
Of course
I can see you.

uh, what's her name...
Quinn?

07:22.524 --> 07:23.758

you come at me?

07:31.233 --> 07:33.300

you know?

07:33.351 --> 07:35.569

I'm all over that.

So where's skills?

10:38.835 --> 10:40.019
Oh, uh, he's working

10:40.103 --> 10:42.337
for that sports coordinating
company in L.A.

10:42.389 --> 10:44.190
I thought he came back
for Lauren.

10:44.274 --> 10:45.357
Yeah.

10:45.442 --> 10:46.726
Uh,
that didn't really...

10:46.810 --> 10:47.727
Got it.

10:49.563 --> 10:50.863
Oh, God.
You and Lauren aren't --

10:50.947 --> 10:53.566
no. No.

10:53.650 --> 10:55.317
How 'bout you?
Are -- are you...

10:55.368 --> 10:56.902
No.

10:58.321 --> 11:00.489
So how's the job search
going?

11:00.540 --> 11:02.291
It's kind of grim,
actually.

11:02.358 --> 11:05.377
Just been sending out résumés
and looking online,

11:05.462 --> 11:08.380
but mostly I've just been
working on my podcast.

11:08.465 --> 11:10.299
Oh, yeah?
You have a podcast?

11:10.366 --> 11:12.501
Yeah. It's this sports website
I'm working on

11:12.552 --> 11:14.970
where I talk about sports
and sports-related topics,

11:15.038 --> 11:16.288
but
I don't know.

11:16.356 --> 11:17.523
I've only gotten 48 hits.

11:17.591 --> 11:18.858
Today?

11:18.925 --> 11:20.876
Well, uh...

11:20.927 --> 11:22.061
Ever.

11:22.145 --> 11:24.146
Oh.

11:24.214 --> 11:26.398
Well, it'll probably
just take some time

11:26.483 --> 11:27.683
to catch on, you know?

11:27.734 --> 11:29.051
Yeah.

11:29.102 --> 11:31.270
Ebay took some time.
So...

11:31.354 --> 11:33.405
Sure.

11:35.108 --> 11:37.326
I should probably go.

11:37.393 --> 11:38.410
Oh. Okay.

11:38.495 --> 11:39.745
I, um...

11:39.830 --> 11:42.064
Thanks you.

11:42.132 --> 11:45.234
Thank you.

11:45.285 --> 11:47.636
I'll see you later.
Or soon.

11:53.710 --> 11:55.461
Hey.

11:57.798 --> 12:01.416
You know, I never told you
congratulations

12:01.468 --> 12:03.686
on your pregnancy.
Thanks.

12:03.753 --> 12:05.137
Well,
you were kind of busy

12:05.222 --> 12:08.641
with the whole
trying-to-live thing, so...

12:08.725 --> 12:10.326
I'm glad you did.

12:10.393 --> 12:12.228
Me too.

12:12.295 --> 12:14.763
So...

12:16.199 --> 12:18.934
We need
to talk about Clay.

12:18.985 --> 12:20.269
Is he awake?

12:20.320 --> 12:21.954
No, he's not.

12:22.038 --> 12:23.956
His organs are failing.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.741
He's on a respirator,

12:25.792 --> 12:28.627
and it's breathing for him
right now.

12:28.712 --> 12:31.780
He's gonna be okay.

12:31.848 --> 12:35.467
He needs
a kidney transplant.

12:35.552 --> 12:36.936
If he doesn't get it,

12:37.003 --> 12:39.505
they don't think
that he's gonna make it.

12:39.589 --> 12:40.706
I need to see him.

12:40.774 --> 12:42.408
You can't.

12:42.475 --> 12:45.127
Hales,
I need to talk to him.

12:45.178 --> 12:46.145
Please.

12:48.464 --> 12:49.765

13:17.677 --> 13:19.428
Starring Robert redford,

13:19.496 --> 13:22.264
"the natural" is the story
of Roy hobbs,

13:22.332 --> 13:25.968
a man in his prime
who is shot at close range

13:26.019 --> 13:27.853
by an obsessive woman.

13:31.674 --> 13:34.343

13:34.394 --> 13:36.845
What are the odds
a kidney becomes available?

13:36.897 --> 13:38.063
It's hard to say.

13:38.148 --> 13:40.682
To find the right match

I want to hear this.

15:16.421 --> 15:18.789
Are they sure
that you couldn't play?

15:18.873 --> 15:20.674

15:55.743 --> 15:57.711
What?

15:57.778 --> 16:01.081
I didn't tell you because

How 'bout you just

17:29.220 --> 17:31.588
There's a moment
in "field of dreams"

17:31.672 --> 17:35.759
where moonlight Graham knows
he'll never play the game again.

17:35.843 --> 17:38.094
And he's at ease with it

17:38.179 --> 17:41.681
because he had his moment
in the sun.

17:41.732 --> 17:45.268
And because he had
something else in his life

17:45.386 --> 17:47.571
to take the game's place.

17:47.655 --> 17:50.273
You have a good day,
Buddy?
Yeah.

17:50.358 --> 17:51.942
How are Clay
and aunt Quinn?

17:52.026 --> 17:55.195
Uh, aunt Quinn's
doing better.

17:55.246 --> 17:58.798
But, uh,
Clay's not doing so good.

17:58.866 --> 18:01.284
He needs
a kidney transplant, Jamie,

18:01.369 --> 18:03.336
so they're gonna see
if they can take one from me.

18:03.404 --> 18:05.205
Will you be okay?
Yeah. I'll be fine.

18:05.273 --> 18:07.740
Um...

18:07.792 --> 18:10.377
I won't be able to play
basketball anymore, though.

18:10.478 --> 18:11.678
Do you have to?

18:11.745 --> 18:13.513
Give Clay your kidney?

18:13.580 --> 18:15.265
No.

18:15.349 --> 18:16.633
No, I don't have to.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.352
But if I don't,
then Clay might not get one.

18:19.420 --> 18:22.022
And if Clay
doesn't get one...

18:22.089 --> 18:24.190
He might never wake up.

18:24.258 --> 18:25.925
Maybe he could
have <i>my</i> kidney.

18:25.977 --> 18:29.145
That way he would be okay and
you could still be a bobcat.

18:29.213 --> 18:31.731
I think you're a little young
for that, jame.

18:31.782 --> 18:33.733
I love you
for the offer, though,

18:33.784 --> 18:35.418
and I know
Clay would, too.

18:35.486 --> 18:38.722
Do you understand how important
this is for Clay, Buddy?

18:38.789 --> 18:39.939
Okay.

18:39.991 --> 18:42.292
I know you loved
that I was a bobcat,

18:42.376 --> 18:45.128
so I understand
if you're a little disappointed.

18:45.212 --> 18:47.914
But just...

21:28.528 --> 21:30.662

games next year

21:30.729 --> 21:33.865

22:00.643 --> 22:04.429
It's too much to imagine.

22:04.480 --> 22:09.767
But that's not gonna happen,

33:35.698 --> 33:37.765
So he goes to the arena,

he goes home to Adrian.

33:42.038 --> 33:43.788

It's a fight he's going to lose.

33:50.913 --> 33:54.799

33:59.755 --> 34:02.507
