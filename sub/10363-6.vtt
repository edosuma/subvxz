17:04.640 --> 17:07.520
Sorry, I didn't mean what I said. Hassan!

17:07.600 --> 17:08.880
Hassan!

17:21.680 --> 17:22.960
[car doors close]

17:29.880 --> 17:33.520
Stanley Olsson?

17:33.600 --> 17:35.920
- Who's asking?
- My name is Laila Lyse.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.360
I'm from Tollvesenet.
This is my colleague, Officer Mørk.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.400
We need you to come down
to the station for questioning.

17:42.480 --> 17:44.320
But what is this about?

17:44.400 --> 17:48.000
Illegal import of liquor to Norway.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.680
Wait a minute. I want a lawyer.

17:51.760 --> 17:56.000
Wait-- Jesus--
I don't have time for this!

17:56.080 --> 17:58.320
Listen--!

17:58.400 --> 18:00.520
Shit.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.040
They nabbed you as well?

18:02.120 --> 18:03.880
Yeah, it doesn't look good.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.280
Ohh!

18:05.360 --> 18:07.160
Bachelor party!

18:07.240 --> 18:09.320
[all cheering]

18:12.240 --> 18:14.080
[bottle cork pops]

18:16.160 --> 18:18.280
[cheering]

18:25.320 --> 18:27.440
[Stanley shouting in Norwegian]

18:27.520 --> 18:30.600
[rock music playing over speakers]

18:30.680 --> 18:31.800
[in English] Come on, girls!

18:31.880 --> 18:33.200
[laughs]

18:33.280 --> 18:35.640
Oh!

18:35.720 --> 18:37.360
[laughs]

18:38.560 --> 18:41.000
[Stanley shouts in Norwegian]

18:52.320 --> 18:54.160
[sighs]

19:01.320 --> 19:03.200
[lively music playing]

19:03.280 --> 19:05.480
Bro, what's up?

19:05.560 --> 19:07.280
What's up, man?

19:07.360 --> 19:09.320
[in Norwegian]
Aren't you going to drink anything?

19:09.400 --> 19:12.840
What's there to celebrate anyway?

19:12.920 --> 19:16.880
What's your problem?
Come on, it is party time.

19:18.840 --> 19:22.000
[in English] How's our groom-to-be doing?

19:22.080 --> 19:23.560
[in Norwegian] He's pretty out of it.

19:23.640 --> 19:26.720
I don't think Mom would be thrilled,
exactly.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.920
Come on,
you're allowed to read the menu,

19:29.000 --> 19:30.760
as long as you eat at home.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.320
Looks like he is chewing
the entire buffet.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.320
[in English] Come on.

19:38.400 --> 19:40.520
A guy's allowed to have fun
at his own bachelor party.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.440
[Stanley laughing]

19:44.400 --> 19:46.000
Ow! Ah!

19:46.080 --> 19:48.280
Fuck you! Oh!

19:48.360 --> 19:52.240
Okay, maybe not that much fun.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.160
Stan the Man.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.920
[both laughing]

19:59.000 --> 20:00.760
Glad you're having a good time.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.960
You know, try and keep it together, Stan.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.320
[in Norwegian]
Okay. It's just that I was locked up

20:05.400 --> 20:07.120
in a fucking cult for ten years.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.480
It feels so great to have some fun again.

20:09.560 --> 20:10.840
Come on, girls, come on.

20:10.920 --> 20:12.760
[in English] Yeah, yeah.
Just take it easy, all right?

20:12.840 --> 20:15.080
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.920
[in Norwegian] I was a little surprised
when you called me.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.000
[in English] What do you take me for?

20:25.080 --> 20:28.960
One of them punks that don't call
after a first date?

20:29.040 --> 20:30.880
[chuckles]

20:33.040 --> 20:35.680
What if I could help you out a little bit?

20:35.760 --> 20:38.200
Would that get you off my back?

20:40.880 --> 20:43.600
[in Norwegian]
It can't be ruled out.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.400
[in English]
Good. Take a look at this.

20:49.960 --> 20:53.440
A friend of mine, let's call him
a concerned citizen,

20:53.520 --> 20:55.720
dropped these off the other day.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.280
Check it out.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.920
[in Norwegian] But this must be...

21:09.000 --> 21:11.800
[in English] The Bieber heist.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.120
Impressed?

21:14.200 --> 21:16.360
Surprised.

21:16.440 --> 21:19.680
[chuckles] Yeah, well...

21:19.760 --> 21:23.760
I heard that most people were upset
their safety-deposit boxes got emptied.

21:23.840 --> 21:26.240
Here it all is.

21:26.320 --> 21:30.120
[in Norwegian] Do you have any indication
of who might have been behind the robbery?

21:31.360 --> 21:32.680
[in English] No.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.480
But let's not get greedy.

21:34.560 --> 21:38.680
You return this,
you're the hero of the day.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.080
[in Norwegian] You are full of surprises.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.160
But you still have to pay
that fine for the taillight.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.760
[in English] The taillight.

21:48.840 --> 21:53.720
[Dubs' "Don't Ask Me
to Be Lonely" playing]

22:08.840 --> 22:10.560
So...

22:10.640 --> 22:12.160
Anything wrong?

22:12.240 --> 22:16.160
[in Norwegian]
No, what makes you think that?

22:16.240 --> 22:21.120
[in English] Well, it's just that, uh...

22:21.200 --> 22:24.640
you're usually not this mellow
around half-naked women.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.560
[both laughing]

22:28.560 --> 22:32.480
I'm a little over-worked, I guess.

22:32.560 --> 22:35.880
[in Norwegian] Always so much fuss
with the asylum-seekers and...

22:35.960 --> 22:38.920
[in English]
But you're on top of it, right?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.600
You know me. Always on top.

22:43.120 --> 22:46.560
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, good.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.200
[Stanley in Norwegian]
Come on, come on!

22:48.280 --> 22:52.360
Get back here!

22:52.440 --> 22:54.880
[in English] Oh, what now?

22:59.480 --> 23:03.440
What happened? What's going on?

23:03.520 --> 23:05.280
Huh?

23:05.360 --> 23:09.120
That Swedish guy is so disgusting.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.080
I'll tell you what, all right?

23:12.160 --> 23:14.600
Uh...

23:14.680 --> 23:17.520
Take the rest of the night off.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.920
Take a taxi home, all right?

23:20.000 --> 23:24.640
Keep this little unfortunate
incident to ourselves, huh?

23:26.280 --> 23:28.440
Okay.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.080
[in Norwegian] Come here, girl!

23:36.680 --> 23:40.320
I think it's time to escort
your new father figure out.

23:40.400 --> 23:42.640
- Yes.
- [in Norwegian] I see.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.240
Let go of me!
You goddamn sons of a whore!

23:45.320 --> 23:48.000
- I don't want to go home!
- Calm down, will you!

23:48.080 --> 23:50.640
- Relax.
- Fucking shit. You fucker!

23:50.720 --> 23:52.880
Scumbag!

23:52.960 --> 23:56.800
He spit at me.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.000
- [in English] What a surprise!
- Hi.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.040
What's the occasion?

24:17.120 --> 24:19.560
[in Norwegian]
I've just been thinkingabout Bjorn's test.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.560
[in English]
You know how I feel about that.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.840
We don't have any choice.
He has to take it.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.280
Hi!

24:25.360 --> 24:26.880
You know it's that Tirly girl, don't you?

24:26.960 --> 24:29.240
It's her job to find things
wrong with kids.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.760
[in Norwegian] And I have been thinking
maybe he is a bit understimulated

24:32.840 --> 24:36.560
because he has no male role model, so...

24:36.640 --> 24:38.480
[in English] So what?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.480
Well, so I was thinking maybe

24:40.560 --> 24:44.640
you could spend some days
with him before the test?

24:44.720 --> 24:46.520
Normally I wouldn't mind, but, uh...

24:46.600 --> 24:48.840
[in Norwegian] Are you going to spend
some time with Daddy?

24:48.920 --> 24:50.240
Yes, go to Daddy.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.840
- [in English] Come to Daddy.
- [in Norwegian] That's it.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.240
Okay, the best of luck.

24:55.320 --> 24:56.760
- [in English] Bye!
- Okay.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.200
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye.

24:59.280 --> 25:00.640
[in Norwegian]
We're going home now.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.560
[in English] Bye now.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.560
Bye-bye.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.200
[door closes]

25:06.280 --> 25:09.400
Arne, get over here.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.680
I need assistance.

25:10.760 --> 25:15.480
[in Norwegian]
Hey, shall we go check the vodka?

25:15.560 --> 25:17.520
Make sure that people don't steal?

25:18.840 --> 25:20.200
[coos, kisses]

25:22.600 --> 25:23.680
[grunts]

25:30.200 --> 25:32.360
- Aah!
- [in Norwegian] Get up.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.320
What the fuck are you doing?

25:35.720 --> 25:37.360
Ohh!

25:37.440 --> 25:40.200
We have to help our neighbor.
His farm has been rampaged.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.360
[Torgeir] Get up, now.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.480
[sheep bleating]

25:58.200 --> 26:00.040
[bleating continues]

26:02.160 --> 26:08.760
- My poor little girl.
- What has happened?

26:08.840 --> 26:12.360
It's worse than we thought.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.640
Have they killed any of the animals?

26:14.720 --> 26:17.600
Not exactly killed...

26:19.120 --> 26:20.680
My little girl.

26:20.760 --> 26:24.600
One of the sheep has been assaulted.

26:24.680 --> 26:25.880
Sexually.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.480
[bleating]

26:36.360 --> 26:38.320
Oh, crap!

26:46.480 --> 26:48.320
[gagging and coughing]

26:54.400 --> 26:56.240
[laughing]

26:57.720 --> 26:59.520
Yes, he did.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.560
I believe he broke his nose.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.800
- Can you see it's red?
- [crowd cheering on TV]

27:13.800 --> 27:15.360
[Johnny in English]
What are you doing?

27:15.440 --> 27:18.400
You're supposed to be
stimulating him up here.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.640
[in Norwegian]
There's a lot of stimuli in this.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.560
Lots of colors and light.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.240
[in English]
Arne, you don't understand.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.960
This kid is taking a major
aptitude test in two days.

27:30.040 --> 27:35.480
You're gonna go out and get him
something that stimulates his brain.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.960
One of them toys

27:41.040 --> 27:44.680
where you put the square things
in the square holes

27:44.760 --> 27:48.760
and the circles in the circles
and the things in the things.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.040
[Arne in English] Okay.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.520
[laughing]

27:54.600 --> 27:57.960
- [Johnny] Arne.
- [in Norwegian] Yeah, yeah, we're going.

27:59.240 --> 28:02.760
Hi. Boss,
we've got a somewhat delicate issue

28:02.840 --> 28:05.440
we have to discuss with you.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.240
Um...

28:12.920 --> 28:15.200
[in English] It's, uh, Stanley.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.240
What's he done now?

28:18.320 --> 28:20.920
He, um...

28:21.000 --> 28:24.040
[in Norwegian]
The thing about Stanley

28:24.120 --> 28:27.640
is he...

28:27.720 --> 28:29.560
[Johnny in English]
What?

28:29.640 --> 28:33.800
- ...crossed a line and--
- What, what, what?

28:33.880 --> 28:37.560
[in Norwegian] Well, there was some
vandalism at the neighbor's farm.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.400
And Stanley, he...

28:39.480 --> 28:42.800
[in English] Come on.
It can't be worsethan yesterday.

28:42.880 --> 28:45.920
[in Norwegian] The district veterinarian
has concluded that Stanley--

28:46.000 --> 28:48.400
- [in English] He raped a sheep.
- [in English] He raped a sheep.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.400
- Really bad.
- Molested it.

28:54.480 --> 28:59.240
And we found this, as well, in the barn.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.080
And the vet examined the sheep's ass,

29:02.160 --> 29:04.880
and they found some semen
in the sheep's ass.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.200
- [Roar] Human semen.
- Okay.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.720
- [Torgeir] It has to be him.
- Okay!

29:07.800 --> 29:10.520
- [Roar] Who else?
- Okay.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.680
It's worse than yesterday.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.960
[in Norwegian] Yes. And we know Stanley is
good for business and everything,

29:17.040 --> 29:19.840
but just the thought of him
and the sheep and Mom...

29:19.920 --> 29:22.040
Yeah, the thought of it.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.800
[Johnny in English] Jesus Christ.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.960
Listen to me.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.960
Disappear this lowlife.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.840
You got it, boss.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.480
We don't have these problems in Brooklyn.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.640
[in Norwegian] Hello there.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.680
What are you doing? What?

29:58.760 --> 30:01.120
- Come here!
- No. You are so fucking funny.

30:01.200 --> 30:06.320
- But I cannot take more partying.
- Hush! Be quiet.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.760
What now?

30:07.840 --> 30:10.040
But what is going on? Hello?

30:10.120 --> 30:13.080
Stop it. What the fuck?

30:13.160 --> 30:16.160
Slow down a little now, boys.

30:16.240 --> 30:19.720
I'm not a young buck anymore.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.280
[laughing]

30:21.360 --> 30:23.280
And who the fuck are you?

30:23.360 --> 30:27.080
Don't tell me you're today's stripper.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.080
I own the farm next door.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.360
Apparently you dropped by
there last night.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.640
That sheep was a gift
for my 50th birthday.

30:36.720 --> 30:42.800
But this is totally crazy.
I went straight home

30:42.880 --> 30:44.680
- and went to bed--
- You forgot this one.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.600
Listen.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.800
I was wasted.

30:54.880 --> 30:59.320
It hasn't always been easy being me.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.520
I've just lost my God.

31:03.080 --> 31:06.000
- Let go! Stop now.
- Sit still!

31:06.080 --> 31:11.280
What the hell are you doing?

31:11.360 --> 31:16.760
How do you spell "Bye" in Swedish?
Is it I or Y?

31:18.200 --> 31:19.560
I.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.080
- [Torgeir] What's that?
- I.

31:22.160 --> 31:26.120
Just sending a little farewell
message from you to Mom.

31:26.200 --> 31:27.480
Why?

[Torgeir]
You just canceled the wedding.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.400
[in Norwegian] Shit.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.880
Didn't expect to see you here.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.440
[in English]
I brought you a little peace offering.

31:52.520 --> 31:54.840
[grunting]

31:56.920 --> 31:59.560
[in Norwegian]
Not the nicest gift I've seen.

31:59.640 --> 32:03.360
[in English] Heh. Well, it's the guy that
inherited your booze business.

32:05.440 --> 32:09.760
Looks like the grass maybe wasn't greener
on the other side, after all?

32:09.840 --> 32:12.520
[in English] You gonna be a smartass
philosopher or you gonna listen?

32:12.600 --> 32:14.440
[laughs]

32:16.680 --> 32:18.840
Okay, I'm listening.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.640
You're gonna get your business back.

32:23.720 --> 32:27.680
I just need a little accommodation.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.680
Drop this scumbag in Sweden.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.560
[grunting]

32:31.640 --> 32:35.520
Make sure he never comes back
to Norway again.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.320
[in Norwegian] I shall make sure
to transmit that message.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.480
[in English] Good.

32:43.800 --> 32:45.240
In that case...

He won't be with me anymore.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.880
I just don't get it.

We talked about this earlier.

34:47.840 --> 34:52.480

Oh. There. And in with it in.

Shit, this isn't working.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.840
It doesn't fit. The thing is fucked up.

how to work this thing or what?

you're a little stressed out, boss,

Well above average.

is that you gave us the wrong twin.

The thing is,
we had to change the child's diapers.

accidentally switched the clothes.

for this. We apologize, really.

of social interaction

of delegating in the local council.

on these developments?

[in Norwegian]  We are happy the bank's
customers have got justice,

42:21.400 --> 42:23.440
so we are indeed pleased.

42:23.520 --> 42:29.240

strong criticism of the investigation

42:29.320 --> 42:33.480
before the sheriff in
Lilyhammer made a breakthrough.

What is your response to that criticism?

We are used to criticism,
so I have no comment.

you've received a lot of praise

42:44.160 --> 42:46.720
for finding all these lost valuables.

42:46.800 --> 42:49.000
Tell us what happened.

I am only doing my job.

Thomas has my number.

you will consider using more often?

Here's looking at you, kid.

43:06.480 --> 43:09.560

Turns out our little friend
is a Mafia snitch.

43:28.920 --> 43:34.280
That means someone over there
will give a lot of money for his address.

43:34.360 --> 43:36.520
So what's the plan?
Go to New York

43:36.600 --> 43:41.080
and search the telephone directory
for Don fucking Corleone, is that it?

43:41.160 --> 43:42.680
Exactly.
