00:01.968 --> 00:04.537
[shower running]

00:07.440 --> 00:10.176
[both moaning]

00:18.551 --> 00:23.623
[moaning continues]

00:27.293 --> 00:29.028
[man screams in pain]

00:30.000 --> 00:30.630
[man] Oh god!

00:36.000 --> 00:36.336
[man continues moaning in pain]

00:36.903 --> 00:38.338
What's happening?

00:38.738 --> 00:40.306
[Lauren exclaims]

00:43.009 --> 00:45.245
[man sobbing]

00:45.979 --> 00:47.747
Oh no!

00:48.000 --> 00:52.218
# I'm like a candle burning
End to end #

00:54.254 --> 00:55.088
[woman] Tea, Ma'am?

00:55.388 --> 00:57.657
Oh, thank you very much.
I appreciate it, thank you.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.530
-I'm a lawyer.
-Hm.

01:03.596 --> 01:05.064
Sorry, I don't know
why I said that.

01:06.000 --> 01:06.166
[knock on door
and door opens]

01:06.232 --> 01:09.002
[man groaning
in pain]

01:12.272 --> 01:14.240
Ah, hey.

01:16.709 --> 01:17.811
Matt?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.212
Lauren?

01:19.279 --> 01:21.214
Ah, you're a paramedic.

01:21.281 --> 01:22.816
Yeah, still am.

01:24.000 --> 01:24.317
What's happened here then?

01:24.851 --> 01:26.152
I'm just have to have
a little look, all right?

01:26.219 --> 01:26.986
[Man sighs] Yeah.

01:27.053 --> 01:28.555
Just relax.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.457
[both] Ow!

01:30.523 --> 01:33.460
The old banjo string snapped
right through there.

01:33.526 --> 01:34.360
[Lauren and man] The what?

01:34.427 --> 01:35.261
Frenulum.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.363
Yeah, bit of skin that connects
the foreskin to the shaft.

01:37.430 --> 01:38.932
The fucking what?

01:38.998 --> 01:40.500
Yeah. There we go.
Have a suck on that.

01:42.000 --> 01:42.602
Let's get him going and
get him into the hospital.

01:42.669 --> 01:43.570
[Matt] You'll be right.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.639
We'll get you into hospital.

01:48.000 --> 01:48.908
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.911
There we go. There we go.
There we go.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.646
She's a bit loose is she?

01:54.000 --> 01:55.682
Hanging by a thread,
and you're all right?

01:55.748 --> 01:58.151
Yes! I'll come.

02:01.654 --> 02:02.956
[man] Am I going to die?

02:03.022 --> 02:05.058
Nah, you lost a
lot of blood though.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.961
Must have been at full
mast when it happened.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.199
[Matt] You, uh,
getting in or...

02:14.434 --> 02:17.237
Getting into the ambulance?
Yeah, I am.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.340
[man] I've never been in
an ambulance before. Lauren!

02:20.707 --> 02:21.474
Yeah.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.743
Lauren, are you there?
The light...

02:24.077 --> 02:26.379
Yes! No! That's just, that's
just the ambulance light.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.947
You're fine.
You're going to be all right.

02:31.784 --> 02:32.819
Chase.

02:32.886 --> 02:33.720
What?

02:36.000 --> 02:36.890
-His name, is Chase.
-Yes.

02:36.956 --> 02:39.492
Yeah, no. I knew that.
You're going to be okay Chase.

02:42.000 --> 02:42.562
[woman] Sorry Miss, Mrs, Madam,

02:42.629 --> 02:44.697
but we have to
charge you for the robe.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.099
Oh, well both the robes.

02:46.165 --> 02:46.900
Yeah okay.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.768
They're $199 each.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.169
For a terry towelling robe?

02:50.236 --> 02:52.672
[man screams in pain]

02:54.000 --> 02:54.307
Put it on my card.

02:55.041 --> 02:57.944
[upbeat music]

03:06.000 --> 03:06.219
He'll be okay though, right?

03:06.286 --> 03:07.720
Won't get a boner for weeks.

03:08.288 --> 03:11.457
But he'll live.
If you can call that living.

03:13.326 --> 03:14.260
Oh god!

03:14.327 --> 03:15.395
What's with the...

03:18.000 --> 03:18.698
Yes. I think I slipped
when it happened.

03:18.765 --> 03:19.666
Right.

03:19.732 --> 03:20.900
Must have pulled
a muscle or something.

03:20.967 --> 03:21.901
Shall we take a look.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.436
Make sure we haven't
done any serious damage.

03:24.000 --> 03:24.871
That hurt?
[Lauren screams in pain]

03:24.938 --> 03:26.472
-Yes.
-Okay.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.841
All right. Well your
mobility's a bit restricted,

03:30.000 --> 03:31.277
but I think it's just strained.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.179
Seriously Loz,

03:33.246 --> 03:35.181
you and your sex
related mishaps?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.083
No, I'm really sorry
about the--

03:37.150 --> 03:38.751
Chlamydia is the word.

03:38.818 --> 03:41.921
Yeah, but I mean, it's quite
common and koalas have it.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.756
If they hang around with
you long enough they do.

03:43.823 --> 03:45.858
-Yeah great.
-Absolutely.

03:48.000 --> 03:48.361
It is a numbers game though,
isn't it?

03:49.262 --> 03:50.063
Oh, hang on Matt.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.864
It's not like I'm out
every night having sex with--

03:51.931 --> 03:52.899
[woman] Excuse me.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.467
Is this yours?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.903
Yep. Thank you. Just--

03:56.970 --> 03:58.671
[Matt] Yep, there we go.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.073
[Lauren] Ow!

04:00.139 --> 04:01.107
[Matt] She's not
a people person.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.075
No.

04:02.141 --> 04:04.744
I guess it's because
we were in the shower.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.147
It means it just sort of washed
away all the natural juices--

04:08.214 --> 04:10.350
Please don't say
natural juices.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.818
The organic lubrication--

04:12.000 --> 04:14.654
When, when did you arrange this
date with banjo boy anyway?

04:14.721 --> 04:15.788
Because it wasn't
on the spreadsheet

04:15.855 --> 04:17.023
Just a last minute thing.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.124
Well thank God
you didn't kill him,

04:18.191 --> 04:19.993
because that'd be a
whole different tab.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.363
Okay, you have been
grumpy all morning,

04:24.000 --> 04:24.364
what is wrong?

04:24.430 --> 04:25.231
No I haven't.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.532
-Yes, you have.
-No I haven't.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.734
-Yes, you have.
-I haven't.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.702
Please stop being
a child. Honestly.

04:30.000 --> 04:30.603
I've got two quite
annoying ones at home.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.537
What's wrong.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.672
Okay, fine.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.174
You missed my
netball semi-finals.

04:36.000 --> 04:36.175
[Lauren exclaims]

04:36.242 --> 04:37.710
It's fine. It's fine.
I get it. I get it.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.680
You're too busy snapping banjo
strings to bother supporting me

04:42.000 --> 04:42.148
on the most important night
of my life this year.

04:42.215 --> 04:43.549
That's fine, I understand it.

04:43.616 --> 04:45.051
I really apologise.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.619
I mean, it was in your
diary and everything.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.121
Didn't you get the
little calendar bings?

04:48.187 --> 04:49.656
Is that what they were.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.024
Yeah!

04:51.090 --> 04:51.924
Oh, I was probably lying

04:54.000 --> 04:54.761
in a pool of someone's
frenulum blood.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.295
Anyway, did you win?

04:57.430 --> 04:58.731
Maybe.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.167
-That's amazing.
-You're off the hook.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.169
I'll cook you
dinner to celebrate.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.671
-Please don't, you can't cook.
-Yes I will.

05:04.737 --> 05:05.938
Just because I don't cook
doesn't mean I can't.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.440
Well it kinda does so, no.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.242
I'll do a recipe.
A really special vegan--

05:09.308 --> 05:10.243
I'm not vegan.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.979
Not vegan recipe, from steak.

05:13.046 --> 05:13.813
[lift dings]

05:13.880 --> 05:14.647
Sorry, what's that?

05:14.714 --> 05:15.715
Is that semen?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.653
No! It's not semen,
it's toothpaste.

05:21.621 --> 05:23.156
Thanks.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.363
Oh, hello?

05:30.430 --> 05:31.631
Hi.

05:31.698 --> 05:34.067
It's just Bob,
being a bit of a dick.

05:34.133 --> 05:34.967
Ahh.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.969
It's our anniversary.

05:37.036 --> 05:38.337
Oh, happy anniversary.

05:38.404 --> 05:39.472
Thanks. He forgot.

05:42.000 --> 05:42.308
I mean I'm, I'm still
sort of attractive aren't I?.

05:42.375 --> 05:44.210
Yes you are.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.179
So you don't think my
eyebrows are too thin?

05:49.482 --> 05:51.184
Uh, no way.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.524
It's just, I look around
at everyone, well you,

06:00.000 --> 06:01.194
and they're saying that
they're living their best life,

06:01.260 --> 06:04.831
and sometimes I just
really hate you.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.666
Okay.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.335
And sometimes I feel
sorry for you,

06:12.000 --> 06:12.739
but I also really envy you.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.110
Maybe I should leave him.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.045
Well you know,
in the olden days,

06:19.112 --> 06:22.148
women couldn't leave a marriage
just because they were unhappy.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.750
But now they can Ange, you
know?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.184
So you think
I should leave him?

06:25.251 --> 06:26.719
No, I, well,
I don't know.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.155
I mean, are you happy?

06:30.000 --> 06:30.022
Well...

06:30.089 --> 06:32.792
I just feel
totally invisible.

06:36.000 --> 06:36.696
Do you really think I'm,
I'm attractive?

06:36.763 --> 06:40.366
You are beautiful Ange.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.373
And Bob, Bob's got a
bit of a gunt Ange.

06:48.007 --> 06:48.975
What's a gunt?

06:49.041 --> 06:50.710
Sorry, I properly
shouldn't have said that.

06:50.777 --> 06:51.911
[Ange] Yes.

06:54.000 --> 06:54.814
[upbeat music]

07:00.000 --> 07:00.186
Yeah, so if we move
Marcus Sexy Moustache,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.522
then we can have dinner
at mine tonight.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.624
Sounds good. Yeah I'm in.

07:06.000 --> 07:06.926
[Lauren gasps and sighs]

07:06.993 --> 07:07.960
-Simon?
-Yep.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.629
What are you doing
at Alex's desk?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.166
Oh, we're hot desking now.
So that's exciting.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.300
Yes.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.202
Yeah it's good for me. I get to
try a lot of different chairs.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.007
Alex?

07:21.073 --> 07:22.108
Hello!

07:24.000 --> 07:24.277
Yeah, I'll bring
the fondue set.

07:25.211 --> 07:29.482
Okay. So dinner tonight
at mine. 7 o'clock.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.683
Oh, right. Okay, great.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.018
God, we're really going
through with this?

07:32.084 --> 07:33.286
Yeah, absolutely.

07:33.352 --> 07:34.821
Okay well, if we do this,
let's do it properly.

07:34.887 --> 07:35.888
-Yep.
-No takeaway.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.456
No, absolutely not.

07:37.523 --> 07:38.991
I want proper napkins.

07:39.058 --> 07:40.660
Okay yeah,
dinner party's my middle name.

07:42.000 --> 07:42.762
I thought it was Feral.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.230
It's Ferahl actually.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.331
-Ferahl!
-Ferahl!

07:45.398 --> 07:47.733
I just noticed you've
cricked your neck,

07:48.000 --> 07:49.669
so I thought I'd give you
this to ease the pain,

07:49.735 --> 07:50.436
if you're interested.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.505
That's really kind.
Thank you.

07:52.572 --> 07:53.372
[Simon] Make sure
it's rubbed in.

07:54.000 --> 07:54.740
-Thanks.
-Pleasure.

07:54.807 --> 07:55.842
Sorry.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.811
[Simon] In your own time.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.113
[upbeat music]

08:02.949 --> 08:04.150
[Abby] You look really
beautiful today.

08:04.217 --> 08:05.218
Oh, thank you.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.587
You have nice makeup on
and your hair,

08:07.653 --> 08:08.788
it's very clean.

08:08.855 --> 08:09.689
Okay, what do you want?

08:09.755 --> 08:10.990
I need you to buy me an amp.

08:11.057 --> 08:11.891
What?

08:12.000 --> 08:12.892
For my electric guitar.

08:12.959 --> 08:13.759
Well you don't
play the guitar.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.595
-I've just started.
-No way Abby,

08:15.661 --> 08:16.829
not another instrument.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.298
It's like you enjoy being
the worst mum in the world.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.267
Yes darling I try
my absolute hardest.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.236
I don't know what
Abby's talking about.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.770
Thank you darling.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.939
You don't look beautiful
at all today.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.875
[Lola] Come on, let's go.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.142
[Lauren] Girls, careful. Ow!

08:33.045 --> 08:35.481
Hey! Well, if it isn't
our little shredder.

08:36.000 --> 08:36.716
What did you call me?

08:37.149 --> 08:38.217
No, the--

08:38.284 --> 08:39.685
[Jake] She told me
about the guitar,

08:39.752 --> 08:41.988
so I asked Matty,
see if he had any gear.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.156
Wow! What do you say Abby?

08:44.223 --> 08:45.057
Thanks Matt.

08:45.124 --> 08:46.158
All good.

08:48.000 --> 08:48.761
Just happy it's finally
going to see some action.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.529
Shred hard.

08:50.596 --> 08:51.731
Oh, I'd say thank you to,

08:51.797 --> 08:53.933
but I know that's going to
drive me completely bonkers.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.734
It absolutely will.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.369
Could you have it
at your place?

08:56.435 --> 08:57.536
Yeah, nah. No space,

08:57.603 --> 08:59.739
and the neighbours
are funny about noise.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.674
Yeah. Mine though,
love noise.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.009
Ah, sweet as!

09:04.911 --> 09:05.845
How's the neck?

09:06.445 --> 09:08.614
Yeah, it's all right.
It's getting better though.

09:08.681 --> 09:09.582
What's wrong with your neck?

09:12.000 --> 09:12.151
Oh, I just cricked it.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.853
What? You slept funny on it?

09:14.387 --> 09:15.554
Mh-hm.

09:15.621 --> 09:16.822
You slipped over didn't you?

09:20.026 --> 09:21.027
I couldn't do it.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.161
Do what?

09:24.000 --> 09:24.263
Breathe out my bum.

09:24.964 --> 09:25.798
Okay.

09:25.865 --> 09:27.033
Wow.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.670
You ripped a what?

09:30.736 --> 09:32.672
A frenulum.
The banjo string.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.307
Jesus Christ!

09:36.000 --> 09:37.143
It means
'little rein' in Latin.

09:37.209 --> 09:38.778
It's on the penis.

09:38.844 --> 09:39.745
Fucking hell Loz
that's really,

09:39.812 --> 09:41.147
that's actually,
it's quite awful.

09:41.213 --> 09:41.814
Yes well it was an accident.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.749
I didn't do it
on purpose did I.

09:43.816 --> 09:47.086
Didn't pull it off with my bare
hands and I cricked my neck
too.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.722
So take that as a warning,
against shower sex.

09:49.789 --> 09:50.756
I don't think Dave and I

09:50.823 --> 09:53.025
would even fit in the
shower at the same time.

09:54.000 --> 09:54.994
Who's frenulum was it anyway?

09:55.061 --> 09:56.062
Chase's.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.663
-Chase?
-Yeah.

09:57.730 --> 09:58.764
That's a verb,
not a name.

09:58.831 --> 09:59.832
Yeah.

10:00.466 --> 10:02.335
Oh my god!

10:02.401 --> 10:04.537
Oh Lauren, do you have to
do that while I'm eating?

10:04.603 --> 10:05.438
Do what?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.374
Ah, stop it. Lauren ooh.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.943
[Helena coughs] Stop it!

10:12.111 --> 10:13.946
[guitar strums loudly]

10:14.013 --> 10:15.948
Why did we have children?

10:18.000 --> 10:18.684
[Helena] Because
we are masochists.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.654
Hang on. Abby,
that's too loud.

10:21.721 --> 10:22.955
No, no, no, no, no.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.157
I'm sorry, too loud, too loud.

10:25.224 --> 10:28.060
Mum, I'll never get Hendrix
good if I don't practice.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.565
Now you can practice
in glorious silence.

10:33.232 --> 10:34.433
There.

10:36.000 --> 10:36.268
You know, most parents
would be worried

10:36.335 --> 10:38.471
about irreversible
hearing loss.

10:38.537 --> 10:39.939
Hmm. Oh.

10:42.000 --> 10:42.208
[low guitar sound]

10:42.541 --> 10:43.676
You know what,

10:43.743 --> 10:46.912
apart from the admittedly
weird Christmas napkins,

10:48.000 --> 10:48.781
this is um, this is
actually very impressive.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.116
Yes, but they are cloth.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.417
Yes I noticed.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.755
Um, are we, is, is this
chicken? Are we eating Angus?

10:55.821 --> 10:58.124
-No, it's duck.
-Okay, good.

11:00.000 --> 11:00.026
[Jake shouting] Loz! You in?

11:00.426 --> 11:03.396
Just dropping off
some um, hello!

11:04.330 --> 11:05.898
Ah, g'day Alex.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.900
-Hello.
-Hi.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.402
I just thought
I'd drop these off

11:09.468 --> 11:11.604
because we haven't
got space at our place.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.540
[Nancy] Yeah, we got an
amazing deal at the wholesaler.

11:14.607 --> 11:16.142
My brother-in-law's a member

11:18.000 --> 11:19.045
and seeing as the girls
go through so much I thought--

11:19.111 --> 11:21.347
They use like two rolls
a day between them.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.181
Yeah.

11:24.000 --> 11:24.150
Can I get you a wine?
Some duck?

11:24.216 --> 11:27.453
This looks impressive.
Is that l'orange?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.255
No, just stuffed.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.456
[Jake] I found this guy.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.858
Hello? Hello.
I couldn't find the tongs.

11:32.925 --> 11:35.094
Oh Jesus, just be
careful with this.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.163
It's a vintage set
from Sweden.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.898
Simon! Why?

11:38.964 --> 11:40.232
Because it's their
national dish.

11:40.299 --> 11:41.333
Right.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.903
This is turning into
quite the dinner party.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.471
Jakey, look at the duck.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.039
[Jake] I know,
it looks delicious.

11:48.000 --> 11:48.474
Duck?

11:49.008 --> 11:49.942
I didn't know
you'd be making duck.

11:50.009 --> 11:51.210
I would've made
my boiled cabbage.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.281
Damn it! Um, that's okay.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.416
Would you like some?

12:00.619 --> 12:02.354
I was wondering,
do you think I should try

12:02.421 --> 12:04.723
and get banjo boy
something to say sorry?

12:06.000 --> 12:06.859
I mean, I'm not sure
Hallmark make a

12:06.926 --> 12:09.595
'hope you dick heals soon'
card or they should.

12:12.000 --> 12:12.131
Oh yes, I was just about to,

12:12.198 --> 12:14.767
oh it's pretty valuable,
so I better...

12:15.201 --> 12:16.969
[Lauren] We were going
to bring it in.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.238
Oh, well it needs a good
polish now after all that.

12:19.305 --> 12:22.908
But uh, just formally, thank
you for a beautiful evening.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.779
Uh, I will see you anon. Ciao.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.080
Ciao.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.584
[Alex winces]

12:33.119 --> 12:34.286
You okay?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.290
Yeah, Lauren hey um,
there wasn't any mushrooms--

12:38.357 --> 12:39.158
Oh bollocks!

12:39.225 --> 12:40.326
Lauren no!

12:42.000 --> 12:42.895
The stuffing.
It was pre-made. I didn't...

12:42.962 --> 12:43.863
..I forgot to take--

12:44.163 --> 12:47.099
You forgot my very specific
and much discussed allergy?

12:48.000 --> 12:48.234
Who's allergic to mushrooms?

12:48.300 --> 12:49.001
I fucking am.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.069
You are.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.271
It's fine. We just need
to use your toilet stat.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.539
I've got loads of
toilet roll anyway so...

12:54.340 --> 12:55.674
Oh god. I've locked...

12:55.741 --> 12:56.876
Please Lauren!

12:56.942 --> 12:59.111
Lola!? Abby, Abby!?

13:00.000 --> 13:00.846
Oh God!

13:00.913 --> 13:02.581
Abby! It's quite
urgent is it yeah?

13:02.648 --> 13:04.817
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, just a bit.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.553
Abby? Darling?

13:08.420 --> 13:09.455
Abby darling.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.159
Abby!

13:13.225 --> 13:15.895
Abby darling hi. Can you
come and open the front door.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.564
Ah! Wow!

13:19.465 --> 13:22.034
Lauren, lauren, Lauren,
we have about 30 seconds

13:24.000 --> 13:25.004
before I take a giant watery
shit in your brand new agave.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.108
Hi, we desperately need
to use your toilet.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.709
[Matt] Oh sure.

13:30.776 --> 13:33.946
Sorry, I wouldn't normally be
so rude, but I've been
poisoned.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.182
Poisoned?

13:37.650 --> 13:40.019
[Alex screaming]
Where the fuck is it?

13:40.085 --> 13:41.921
Just first left.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.158
I'm a paramedic,
I should check he's not dying.

13:48.000 --> 13:48.060
-He's had mushrooms.
-Mushrooms?

13:48.127 --> 13:49.328
He's allergic.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.330
[Alex groaning in pain]

13:54.000 --> 13:55.167
[high energy music]

14:06.000 --> 14:06.812
Peppermint? How you feeling?

14:06.879 --> 14:08.347
Ginger! How do think I feel

14:08.414 --> 14:10.349
after shitting in your friend,
slash, occasional shag,

14:12.000 --> 14:12.751
slash client's hallway,
slash, ensuite,

14:12.818 --> 14:14.386
for two and a half
hours last night?

14:14.453 --> 14:15.988
I'm sorry. I won't
cook you mushroom again.

14:16.488 --> 14:17.289
And?

14:18.000 --> 14:18.791
I'm a terrible friend.

14:19.158 --> 14:19.992
And?

14:20.059 --> 14:21.260
I'm a terrible cook.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.461
And?

14:24.000 --> 14:24.663
-Told you so?
-Yes, precisely.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.699
Please don't be cross with me
anymore. I don't like it.

14:26.765 --> 14:27.733
You can make it up to me

14:27.800 --> 14:29.602
by being my date tonight
to this new wine bar.

14:30.000 --> 14:30.636
Okay.

14:30.836 --> 14:32.271
Yeah, Rhys was supposed to
come but he's away for work.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.175
They've got this '98 Chateau
Mornag from Tunisia...

14:36.709 --> 14:38.377
[Alex] Hi Ange, looking good.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.713
God! Good! Looking good.

14:40.779 --> 14:41.847
Wow!

14:42.000 --> 14:44.283
It's the new me,
taking control.

14:44.350 --> 14:45.451
Good.

14:45.517 --> 14:46.619
[Simon] Hi gang.

14:48.000 --> 14:48.087
I'm just going to pop out
and get some boob juice--

14:48.153 --> 14:49.288
Boost!

14:50.256 --> 14:52.091
Boost Juice!

14:52.157 --> 14:53.325
Ah, do you guys want one?

14:54.000 --> 14:54.226
Love a mango?

14:54.293 --> 14:55.427
Just the one?

14:56.095 --> 14:58.697
[upbeat music]

15:01.133 --> 15:05.070
Abby? Have you lost
your guitar, already?

15:06.000 --> 15:06.572
[Abby] No! I quit.

15:06.639 --> 15:07.873
What! Why?

15:07.940 --> 15:10.042
[phone ringing]

15:12.000 --> 15:12.778
Ah, hello Eric.

15:12.845 --> 15:13.879
Hi Abby's mum.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.281
Is Abby there?

15:15.347 --> 15:16.715
Yes, just a minute.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.217
Abby! It's Eric.

15:18.284 --> 15:20.286
[Abby] I can't speak to him.

15:20.352 --> 15:21.153
Why not?

15:24.000 --> 15:24.056
Because I didn't get in Eric's
rock band. I'm not cool enough.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.257
[Eric on phone] Hello? Abby?

15:25.324 --> 15:27.726
-She's doing a poo.
-She's not.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.862
A poo!?

15:31.196 --> 15:32.031
Hi.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.401
Hey Abby, so we decided we do
want you to be in the band.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.536
But can you play a viola?

15:37.603 --> 15:38.737
Viola?

15:38.804 --> 15:39.605
Yeah, it'll be like

15:42.000 --> 15:42.241
Velvet Underground meets
early Smashing Pumpkins.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.609
That'd be so cool.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.210
Oh, okay, sure.

15:48.000 --> 15:48.247
[Eric] Awesome!
Okay see you tomorrow.

15:49.581 --> 15:52.418
You see, you didn't have
to play the guitar at all.

15:52.484 --> 15:53.952
Well, I thought

15:54.019 --> 15:56.388
if I played a cool instrument
it would be better.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.123
Yeah, but you were already
cool.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.292
-Please don't say cool.
-Why not?

16:00.359 --> 16:03.829
[Jamaican accent] You're cool.
I'm cool. Everybody's cool.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.230
I'm going.

16:06.000 --> 16:06.498
[Lola] You're not cool.

16:06.565 --> 16:09.034
I am cool.
Why am I not cool?

16:12.000 --> 16:12.404
Because nobody has ever said,
"you are cool."

16:12.471 --> 16:14.606
Have they? Ever!

16:18.000 --> 16:18.310
No.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.612
Right. Let's go to Dad's.

16:22.214 --> 16:23.816
[upbeat music]

16:26.752 --> 16:28.620
[knocking on door]

16:32.691 --> 16:34.393
Oh, Ange.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.394
[Ange laughing]

16:36.000 --> 16:36.695
I left him.

16:37.730 --> 16:38.831
Oh! Okay.

16:42.000 --> 16:42.368
Yeah, I took your advice.
I called him a gunt and...

16:43.068 --> 16:46.004
Oh wow. That's good?
Are you happy?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.041
I'm amazing. Fine!
It's fine! It's fine.

16:49.108 --> 16:52.411
You know, I though, it's time
that I grabbed life by the...

16:54.000 --> 16:54.913
..balls!

16:54.980 --> 16:57.416
You know, by the horns
and have some fun.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.752
-Have some fun.
-Have some fun.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.421
-Your house!
-Oh yes, thank you.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.923
-A home.
-Oh, thank you.

17:06.000 --> 17:06.892
I'm actually on my way out.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.494
Oh we're going out?

17:08.560 --> 17:09.928
We're heading out for some fun.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.097
-Let's go! You ready?
-Let's go, yeah.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.166
We're heading out people.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.534
Oh!

17:18.000 --> 17:19.605
[upbeat music]

17:24.000 --> 17:24.309
[Ange slurring her words] Oh
I should do up my own shoe,

17:24.376 --> 17:25.344
I'll fix it.

17:25.411 --> 17:28.881
Angela!
What a lovely surprise.

17:28.947 --> 17:29.982
She left Bob.

17:30.048 --> 17:30.983
Oh.

17:31.049 --> 17:33.185
I just have to fix my shoe.

17:33.252 --> 17:34.153
Oh, I'll take that.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.220
No, no.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.255
Okay.

17:36.321 --> 17:37.556
I'm sorry.

17:38.056 --> 17:40.592
-Alex?
-Yes.

17:42.528 --> 17:43.896
We're getting pissed.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.297
Yeah, it looks like you've had

17:45.364 --> 17:47.833
a little bit of a
head start on us there Ange.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.334
Men are horrible.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.204
Yes, we are aren't we?

17:54.000 --> 17:54.072
Okay. Let's go.

17:54.139 --> 17:55.274
Yeah, okay.

17:55.340 --> 17:56.809
It's a wine bar so lets--

17:56.875 --> 17:59.278
Just leave it. Let her have it.
Let her have it!

18:00.813 --> 18:02.614
Let's get shots.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.017
What are those ones
you set fire to?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.189
[Alex] I have a booking.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.492
Alex Ryan.

18:13.559 --> 18:17.996
It's for two but I was
wondering if we could change it
to three?

18:18.063 --> 18:21.099
Hmm. Doubt it.
It'll see what I can do.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.335
-What time was your booking?
-Seven.

18:24.336 --> 18:27.139
Hmm, oh we've given
your table away.

18:27.206 --> 18:28.040
Hmm, sorry?

18:28.106 --> 18:29.374
Well, you've been
marked as a no-show.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.310
And yet, here we are.

18:31.376 --> 18:33.412
Yes, twenty minutes late.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.681
Thirteen minutes.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.449
We can put you on
the waiting list

18:37.516 --> 18:40.752
in case there's another
no-show, but it's highly
unlikely.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.323
People tend to make their
reservations here, on time.

18:44.389 --> 18:46.525
This is appalling.

18:46.592 --> 18:47.626
It's life.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.828
No, he booked and you said
that you'd hold a table.

18:49.895 --> 18:50.863
[Lauren] It's all right Ange.

18:54.000 --> 18:54.933
No! He is ethically, and
morally bound to uphold that
promise!

18:55.000 --> 18:57.436
She's, she's very excited.
She read that article.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.638
We're only a
teeny tiny bit late.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.107
Yes, twenty minutes
isn't teeny tiny.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.242
[Alex] Thirteen.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.676
-[Ange] Does it matter?
-[Lauren] Oh no.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.079
You can't just say that
you're going to do something

19:07.145 --> 19:08.514
and then not do it.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.983
You have to deliver
on your promises.

19:12.000 --> 19:12.718
Are you listening to me?

19:12.784 --> 19:15.754
[Ange hits desk] You have to
freaking well deliver, okay?

19:18.000 --> 19:18.423
[Alex] Okay, yep we're going.
We are off. Thank you.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.925
Bye!

19:20.792 --> 19:22.027
[Alex] Ah, just this way.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.233
[Lauren] Shall we get a bottle?
Do an Ange.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.067
It's not quite

19:30.000 --> 19:32.471
the inclusive Instagrammable
experience I was after.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.640
That guy was a total pillock.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.308
Total pillock.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.311
Oh no.

19:42.214 --> 19:45.083
I'm really sorry for making you
shit yourself at Matt's house.

19:45.584 --> 19:46.952
And I'm sorry I missed
your netball match.

19:48.000 --> 19:48.687
I promise I'll
make your finals.

19:48.754 --> 19:49.788
You better.

19:49.855 --> 19:50.956
-If you remind me.
-Obviously.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.357
I swear to God I'll be there.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.393
You don't believe in God--

19:54.459 --> 19:56.662
Does that mean we should do
something about--

20:00.000 --> 20:00.032
Oh Ange, I'm not sure
that's a great idea.

20:00.098 --> 20:01.767
No, no, it's okay.

20:01.833 --> 20:05.804
I've actually got the
thighs of a Clydesdale.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.973
I just need someone to ride me.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.074
Should we--

20:09.141 --> 20:10.275
Just don't look.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.578
[sound of Ange urinating]

20:18.000 --> 20:18.951
[Ange struggling]

20:19.017 --> 20:20.752
[Ange falling into water]

20:20.819 --> 20:22.854
[Ange gasping]

20:30.000 --> 20:31.396
You know, when you swallow too
much water you can dry drown.

20:31.463 --> 20:32.898
-Really?
-Yes.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.300
Yeah. It's a very
real concern.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.202
Yeah, absolutely.

20:37.269 --> 20:39.871
I mean, it may have
just been a second,

20:39.938 --> 20:41.306
but I definitely chocked.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.275
Yep, better to be safe--

20:43.342 --> 20:44.776
No one wants you to dry drown.

20:44.843 --> 20:46.778
Hm-mm.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.085
I hate my new eyebrows.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.419
They're great.

20:56.722 --> 20:59.458
Alex, can I please burrow
your phone 'cause this one,

21:00.000 --> 21:00.525
I can't make it work.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.860
Um, yeah, sure.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.864
I should probably call Bob.

21:06.000 --> 21:11.336
[laughs] It's the only number
I actually know off by heart.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.639
That's so depressing.

21:18.000 --> 21:18.410
I think, fluids.
I think I need fluids.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.145
I'll get you some fluids.

21:20.212 --> 21:21.613
You, sit.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.685
[phone ringing]

21:30.000 --> 21:30.255
Bob!

21:30.856 --> 21:33.392
I think you have to come and
pick me up from the hospital.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.095
Well I don't think
I can wait 45 minutes.

21:38.897 --> 21:39.998
What are you watching?

21:45.337 --> 21:46.905
Oh god!

21:48.000 --> 21:49.441
Ah! Well it's nice
to see you too.

21:49.508 --> 21:52.144
Sorry. I just didn't
expect to bump into you,

21:52.210 --> 21:53.445
well here in a hospital.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.380
-I'm a paramedic.
-Paramedic.

21:55.447 --> 21:56.481
Comes with the territory.

21:56.548 --> 21:58.216
Ah, what are you doing here?

21:58.283 --> 21:59.284
My boss got drunk

22:00.000 --> 22:01.219
and fell into a river
whilst trying to urinate.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.588
Just an average night then.

22:06.000 --> 22:06.391
Yeah, standard for me,
absolutely.

22:06.458 --> 22:08.160
Yeah.

22:08.226 --> 22:09.895
[Alex] Oh okay.

22:09.961 --> 22:10.796
Oh!

22:12.000 --> 22:12.097
-Hey
-Paramedic, right.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.198
Bob's on his way

22:13.265 --> 22:14.900
and I told her we'd forget
all about it by Monday.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.134
Okay.

22:18.837 --> 22:19.838
Will we though?

22:19.905 --> 22:21.373
Well maybe she'll
make you partner

22:21.440 --> 22:22.674
out of sheer
embarrassment.

22:22.741 --> 22:23.575
Yeah!

22:24.000 --> 22:25.577
Can I give you guys
a ride, or...

22:26.745 --> 22:29.414
[Alex] This is great,
this is great.

22:30.000 --> 22:30.682
[Matt] So Alex how's the tummy?

22:30.749 --> 22:33.418
Ah, thank you for remembering.

22:36.000 --> 22:36.455
Relax mate, I see people
shit themselves all the time.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.289
Do you?

22:37.355 --> 22:38.657
-Nah.
-Oh.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.158
How's the macrame going?

22:40.225 --> 22:41.560
Macrame? Good.

22:42.000 --> 22:42.561
Ah, bad.

22:42.627 --> 22:45.997
Oh, maybe stick to
the bacteria milk thing.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.300
I ordered all this
stuff online from Russia,

22:48.366 --> 22:51.369
but all the directions
are in Slavic or Baltic.

22:51.436 --> 22:52.938
Oh god, the smell of river.

22:54.000 --> 22:54.773
Sorry, this week has been
such a bloody mess.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.007
[Alex coughs] Quite literally.

23:00.000 --> 23:00.278
You're a mess. In a good way.
You wear it well.

23:00.345 --> 23:01.613
Oh right, thank you.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.483
I'm pleased I wear it well.
That's what I've been going
for.

23:06.000 --> 23:06.184
You're killing it.

23:12.000 --> 23:12.958
Yeah Matt, um, I wondered.
Can I ask you another favour?

23:13.024 --> 23:15.227
Sorry, this may be a
bit inappropriate but...

23:15.293 --> 23:16.661
Now?

23:18.000 --> 23:18.697
I kind of owe Alex.

23:18.764 --> 23:20.599
[ambulance siren blares]

23:20.665 --> 23:22.501
[Alex] I love sirens!

23:22.567 --> 23:23.935
[siren continues]

23:24.002 --> 23:26.605
[Alex laughing]

23:30.000 --> 23:31.376
[gentle banjo music]

23:36.000 --> 23:37.415
[banjo string snaps]
