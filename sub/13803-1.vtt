00:35.433 --> 00:38.061
(instrumental music playing)

00:55.420 --> 00:57.320
Man:
Ah, heaven,

00:57.355 --> 01:00.347
God's wondrous creation,

01:00.392 --> 01:03.486
His perfect domain.

01:06.398 --> 01:08.298
Could there ever be
a place more...

01:08.333 --> 01:10.801
well, heavenly?

02:16.768 --> 02:21.068
Nothing in creation compares
to heaven with its streets of gold,

02:21.106 --> 02:24.007
its perfect location in the universe,

02:24.042 --> 02:26.306
its perfect weather.

02:26.344 --> 02:31.043
And every day every resident,
from the angels and cherubs

02:31.082 --> 02:34.017
to the seraphim and archangels...

02:34.052 --> 02:38.045
in fact, all the celestial beings
including the angemals...

02:38.089 --> 02:39.488
yes,

02:39.524 --> 02:43.483
to answer the age old question,
there are indeed animals in heaven...

02:43.528 --> 02:48.397
all do their best to keep heaven
the perfectly perfect place

02:48.433 --> 02:50.924
God created it to be.

02:58.476 --> 03:00.444
(grunts)

03:01.913 --> 03:04.211
Hmph, gotcha.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.885
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

03:07.919 --> 03:09.853
Whoa!

03:12.991 --> 03:15.255
Watch where
you're going, miniwings!

03:15.293 --> 03:18.228
(narrator clears throat)
Yes well,

03:18.263 --> 03:20.424
except for one little fellow.

03:20.465 --> 03:23.457
- And we'll get to him in a moment.
- (laughter)

03:23.501 --> 03:25.230
Among all the heavenly beings,

03:25.270 --> 03:26.999
the little angels are the ones

03:27.038 --> 03:29.404
who must work the hardest
on perfection.

03:36.348 --> 03:40.250
They must learn to keep
their heavenly clothes perfectly clean.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.744
(laughing)

03:43.788 --> 03:48.020
They must be certain their halos
sparkle like sunlight.

03:52.397 --> 03:56.231
And they must practice
practice practice

03:56.267 --> 03:59.703
to become the most
angelic beings they can be

03:59.738 --> 04:03.105
so they may one day
help all of humanity.

04:04.843 --> 04:07.869
(laughing)

04:07.912 --> 04:10.745
Welcome to Angel Academy,
where angels train

04:10.782 --> 04:13.979
and every day feels like Sunday.

04:28.099 --> 04:30.067
(cheering)

04:42.414 --> 04:44.006
(bell rings)

04:44.048 --> 04:45.913
- (laughter)
- Whoa!

04:48.186 --> 04:50.313
Good morning, my little cherubs,

04:50.355 --> 04:54.052
and welcome to another
perfect day at Angel Academy.

04:54.092 --> 04:55.992
(chimes)

04:56.027 --> 04:57.927
Step right up to the wingding.

04:57.962 --> 05:00.453
Let's see how many
of God's lessons you've learned

05:00.498 --> 05:02.398
and how much your wings
have grown.

05:02.434 --> 05:04.732
- Cherubs: Me me me!
- Sarah.

05:09.808 --> 05:13.300
Excellent.
5cms growth since last time.

05:13.344 --> 05:16.336
Keep up the good work
in cloud-fluffing class, Sarah.

05:16.381 --> 05:18.611
You'll be flying
back and forth to earth

05:18.650 --> 05:20.743
doing the good Lord's work
in no time.

05:24.722 --> 05:27.850
Excellent. Off you go.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.860
Flight training
class for you, Joshua.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.452
Ow!

05:33.498 --> 05:37.958
Note to self: After-school tutoring
might be in order for Joshua.

05:39.037 --> 05:43.133
Hurry hurry, but remember,
it's not angelic to push.

05:43.174 --> 05:45.301
I see you there, Mary.
Don't dally now.

05:45.343 --> 05:47.402
Mustn't be late
for good deed class.

05:50.381 --> 05:53.544
Ah, another day
of perfect attendance.

05:53.585 --> 05:57.112
Yes, all's right in heaven
and earth this glorious mor...

05:57.155 --> 05:59.988
(gasps)
There's one angel missing.

06:08.399 --> 06:10.026
Narrator:
Poor angel Alban.

06:10.068 --> 06:11.797
- (bell chimes)
- Oh!

06:11.836 --> 06:14.566
Heaven knows he tries to teach
all his young charges

06:14.606 --> 06:18.702
everything there is to know
about being God's perfect angels.

06:22.447 --> 06:25.280
But it seems
there is one little angel...

06:25.316 --> 06:27.876
no matter how hard Alban tries,

06:27.919 --> 06:31.377
he's never able to make
this one shape up and fly right.

06:32.957 --> 06:36.256
I'm speaking
of heaven's littlest angel.

06:41.399 --> 06:44.596
I see you, big guy.
You won't get away this time.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.140
- (yelps)
- Gotcha.

06:51.175 --> 06:52.870
Whoa!

06:52.911 --> 06:55.709
(screaming, grunts)

07:01.553 --> 07:03.953
- Littlest: Yikes!
- Oh my!

07:03.988 --> 07:06.923
What in heaven's name?

07:06.958 --> 07:10.587
(humming tune)

07:11.629 --> 07:13.221
Watch out!

07:17.769 --> 07:20.499
- Aha!
- (screaming)

07:20.538 --> 07:23.507
There you are, you little...
little...

07:23.541 --> 07:25.133
little angel, you.

07:26.144 --> 07:27.509
Headmaster.

07:27.545 --> 07:32.141
You missed
the morning schoolbell again.

07:32.183 --> 07:34.549
Let go of that rope this instant.

07:34.586 --> 07:36.520
Yes, Headmaster.

07:36.554 --> 07:38.385
I'm... whoa!

07:38.423 --> 07:41.358
- Littlest?
- Whoa!

07:43.595 --> 07:46.428
¶ Ooooooh ¶

07:46.464 --> 07:50.628
- ¶ Bum bum bum ¶
- ¶ Ooh ahh, ooh ahh... ¶

07:50.668 --> 07:53.398
- Look out!
- Littlest!

07:53.438 --> 07:56.100
(harmonizing continues)

07:59.410 --> 08:00.399
Uh oh.

08:00.445 --> 08:02.970
¶ Shooby dooby,
shooby doo-wop bop ¶

08:03.014 --> 08:05.380
¶ Here we go all over again ¶

08:05.416 --> 08:08.112
¶ For him it never seems to end ¶

08:08.152 --> 08:10.848
¶ It happens nine times
out of 10 ¶

08:10.888 --> 08:13.914
¶ Trouble is his only friend ¶

08:13.958 --> 08:17.291
¶ He may be small
but at the end of the day ¶

08:17.328 --> 08:20.695
¶ You will never catch him
for it seems ¶

08:20.732 --> 08:25.669
¶ His trouble's here to stay ¶

08:28.973 --> 08:33.433
- (signing doo-wop)
- ¶ No matter how hard he may try... ¶

08:33.477 --> 08:35.605
- Yikes!
- ¶ Trouble finds him every time ¶

08:35.647 --> 08:38.548
- (screams)
- ¶ All we do is heave a sigh ¶

08:38.582 --> 08:41.051
¶ And follow him across the sky ¶

08:41.085 --> 08:43.883
¶ He may be small
but at the end of the day ¶

08:43.921 --> 08:47.322
¶ You'll never catch him 'cause
it seems his trouble's here to stay ¶

08:47.358 --> 08:49.087
¶ Stay stay stay stay! ¶

08:49.127 --> 08:52.255
¶'Cause he's the littlest angel ¶

08:52.296 --> 08:53.285
¶ Littlest angel ¶

08:53.331 --> 08:55.663
¶ Someday
he's gonna figure it out ¶

08:55.700 --> 08:57.600
¶ He's the littlest angel ¶

08:57.635 --> 08:59.102
¶ Littlest angel ¶

08:59.137 --> 09:03.130
¶ Someday he's gonna prove himself
without a doubt ¶

09:03.174 --> 09:05.074
¶ He's the littlest angel ¶

09:05.109 --> 09:06.940
¶ Littlest angel... ¶

09:06.978 --> 09:08.536
(fireworks popping)

09:10.348 --> 09:11.713
Oh, Littlest.

09:11.749 --> 09:14.343
- (grunts)
- Whoa!

09:17.588 --> 09:20.955
Uh oh,
wings, don't fail me now.

09:25.596 --> 09:29.157
You stop! Or I'll clip
your wings so short

09:29.200 --> 09:31.930
you won't fly again
until the end of days.

09:33.337 --> 09:35.032
(panting)

09:38.676 --> 09:41.474
Wait for me.
I'll get you.

09:41.512 --> 09:44.504
You, stop. Wait.

09:50.254 --> 09:51.482
(screaming)

09:57.428 --> 10:00.295
(camera whirring)

10:00.331 --> 10:04.358
"Heavenly Streets of Gold"
public service announcement

10:04.402 --> 10:07.371
take 93. And action.

10:07.405 --> 10:11.466
Heavenly residents, in order
to make heaven a more peaceful place

10:11.509 --> 10:14.637
we kindly ask thee
to honor thy curfew,

10:14.679 --> 10:19.207
keep the peace and never speak
in other than the most dulcet tones.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.684
(screaming)

10:24.522 --> 10:27.923
- Oof!
- Cut cut cut cut!

10:27.959 --> 10:29.984
Can't you see
we're filming here?

10:30.027 --> 10:33.292
- Alban?
- (whimpers)

10:33.331 --> 10:37.597
- Alban, it's me Logan.
- Logan?

10:37.635 --> 10:41.867
Angel Academy's number one
draft pick into the archangels.

10:41.906 --> 10:43.874
- Don't you remember...
- I hate to break up

10:43.908 --> 10:46.172
your little
training school reunion

10:46.210 --> 10:48.576
but we're trying to film here!

10:48.613 --> 10:52.049
L-L... Logan!
Yes, of course I remember.

10:52.083 --> 10:55.519
Didn't you hold the school's
speed cloud jumping record?

10:55.553 --> 10:57.646
You remembered!

10:57.688 --> 11:00.213
Logan, I need your help.

11:00.258 --> 11:04.160
- I've got a truant angel on the run.
- Come on.

11:04.195 --> 11:07.062
We'll take Brimstone.

11:07.098 --> 11:08.588
(whinnies)

11:14.305 --> 11:16.830
(neighs)

11:16.874 --> 11:21.311
You walk off this shoot
and there'll be heck to pay, Logan!

11:21.345 --> 11:22.369
God...

11:23.414 --> 11:26.281
Sorry.
The H-word, I know.

11:38.196 --> 11:40.528
- (gasps)
- (rumbling)

11:44.135 --> 11:45.966
Logan, there he is.

11:46.003 --> 11:49.131
Oh no, the Four Horses
of the Apocalypse

11:49.173 --> 11:51.869
are coming down the home stretch
having their workout.

11:53.611 --> 11:57.411
- Alban: Whoa!
- Keep practicing, boys.

11:57.448 --> 12:00.611
Your day will come.

12:00.651 --> 12:04.280
That does it! Your wings are clipped
and you're grounded.

12:04.322 --> 12:06.847
- But I was only trying to catch...
- Trust me, little guy,

12:06.891 --> 12:09.451
you don't want to "but" him
when he's in this kind of mood.

12:16.534 --> 12:19.526
Late for the morning bell again:
Five demerits.

12:19.570 --> 12:22.835
Running when told to stop:
Seven demerits.

12:22.874 --> 12:25.900
- But I saw a dog...
- Oh, don't be absurd.

12:25.943 --> 12:27.877
There are no dogs
in Celestial City.

12:27.912 --> 12:31.006
Everyone knows all the animals
except the beasts of burden

12:31.048 --> 12:33.608
choose to live out
in the heavenly countryside.

12:33.651 --> 12:36.950
So fibbing: 10 demerits.

12:36.988 --> 12:39.684
- But I swear I saw him.
- Ah ah ah!

12:39.724 --> 12:42.249
Swearing: 15 demerits.

12:42.293 --> 12:44.727
Kid, quit while you're ahead.

12:44.762 --> 12:48.596
But I saw a dog, Logan.
I used to have one of my own.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.794
I know what they
look and sound like.

12:50.835 --> 12:53.099
Yeah well, see,
this is heaven, little guy.

12:54.138 --> 12:57.574
Take a gander... beautiful
and big enough for all the animals

12:57.608 --> 13:00.133
to have their own space
to live wild and free.

13:00.177 --> 13:02.771
No masters telling them
what to do up here,

13:02.813 --> 13:05.475
so the animals all stick
to their side of heaven.

13:05.516 --> 13:09.782
Exactly. So you're going to have
to come up with a better excuse

13:09.820 --> 13:12.050
than "I was chasing a doggy."

13:19.897 --> 13:23.856
All right, everyone, get ready
for your flight training exam.

13:27.305 --> 13:29.705
(laughs, shouts)

13:35.613 --> 13:37.012
(screams)

13:43.821 --> 13:48.087
¶ Angels we have
heard on high ¶

13:48.125 --> 13:52.255
¶ Sweetly singing
o'er the plains ¶

13:52.296 --> 13:56.995
¶ And the mountains in reply ¶

13:57.034 --> 14:00.902
¶ Echoing
their joyous strains ¶

14:00.938 --> 14:04.169
- ¶ Gloo-ooo... ¶
- (sings off-key)

14:05.810 --> 14:09.439
- ¶ Gloria... ¶
- (gasps)

14:09.480 --> 14:11.880
¶ In excelsis... ¶

14:20.658 --> 14:24.560
Just lip-synch and bang the cymbals
when I give the signal.

14:27.298 --> 14:30.734
¶ In excelsis deo ¶

14:30.768 --> 14:38.903
¶ Glo-ooo-ria ¶

14:38.943 --> 14:43.403
¶ In excelsis deo... ¶

14:43.447 --> 14:44.436
(gasps)

14:46.050 --> 14:47.813
(laughter)

15:21.819 --> 15:23.753
(thunder rumbles)

15:24.755 --> 15:27.019
(yelps)

15:28.526 --> 15:30.460
(groans)

15:39.603 --> 15:43.630
- Huh?
- Go see the angel of peace.

15:43.674 --> 15:46.165
It's the only way the rest
of heaven will get any.

16:00.891 --> 16:03.291
Narrator:
And so the littlest angel went off

16:03.327 --> 16:06.558
to his judgment at the hands
of the angel of peace.

16:06.597 --> 16:10.089
He knew things weren't
going well for him in heaven

16:10.134 --> 16:12.466
and he wondered what they'd do

16:12.503 --> 16:15.961
to a little angel who just wasn't
happy in the grandest place

16:16.006 --> 16:18.270
in all the universe.

16:55.146 --> 16:57.444
Woman's voice:
Littlest. Littlest.

16:59.183 --> 17:01.617
Littlest?

17:11.295 --> 17:13.923
(echoing laughter)

17:16.534 --> 17:19.401
Littlest.
So you're the one

17:19.435 --> 17:21.869
who's been making heaven
so unheavenly.

17:22.906 --> 17:25.432
Um, I guess so.

17:25.476 --> 17:28.240
Why don't you
tell me all about it?

17:29.980 --> 17:32.949
Narrator: And suddenly before
he knew it, he was explaining

17:32.983 --> 17:36.885
how very difficult it was for a boy
who suddenly finds himself

17:36.921 --> 17:41.620
transformed into an angel.
And no matter what Alban had told her,

17:41.659 --> 17:44.219
he'd only swung once.

17:44.261 --> 17:46.695
Well, twice.

17:47.698 --> 17:51.225
Oh, all right. Then he'd swung
three times on the pearly gates.

17:51.268 --> 17:53.259
That was only
for something to do.

17:53.304 --> 17:57.104
But heaven is full
of wonderful things to do and see

17:57.141 --> 18:00.338
- and be.
- It's not that heaven isn't beautiful.

18:00.377 --> 18:02.607
(sighs)

18:02.646 --> 18:06.047
- But earth was really great.
- Indeed.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.846
What did you like so much?

18:07.885 --> 18:10.979
Well, you know it was created
by God himself

18:11.021 --> 18:13.649
and there were trees to climb

18:13.691 --> 18:15.989
and brooks to fish

18:16.026 --> 18:18.859
and caves to play hide 'n' seek,

18:18.896 --> 18:21.956
the swimming hole and sun

18:21.999 --> 18:23.432
and rain

18:23.467 --> 18:25.935
and dark and dawn

18:25.970 --> 18:28.996
and the thick mud that
squished between your toes.

18:29.039 --> 18:32.975
And here, even though
I try to do angel stuff,

18:33.010 --> 18:36.411
I miss things the way
they were on earth.

18:45.990 --> 18:49.983
I'm going to show you
all heaven has to offer

18:50.027 --> 18:53.394
once you've earned
your full-grown angel wings.

18:54.431 --> 18:57.400
(groans)
Yeah well,

18:57.434 --> 18:59.561
how come mine
never seem to grow?

18:59.603 --> 19:04.040
Simple, you haven't completed your
good deeds class at the academy.

19:04.074 --> 19:09.034
You mean if I do that, I'll grow big
wings like yours and Logan's?

19:09.079 --> 19:12.810
Not quite.
For you see, Littlest,

19:12.850 --> 19:15.148
everything you've been
learning so far

19:15.185 --> 19:18.279
makes it easier for you
to be a good angel.

19:18.322 --> 19:22.383
Next you'll be required
to master minor miracles

19:22.426 --> 19:26.226
in good deeds class.
When you've done that,

19:26.263 --> 19:28.731
then you'll be required
to travel to earth

19:28.766 --> 19:32.258
and perform three
honest-to-goodness

19:32.303 --> 19:36.239
unselfish good deeds
and earn your angel wings.

19:36.273 --> 19:38.833
But for now,

19:38.876 --> 19:41.310
I think you'll find
this area of heaven

19:41.345 --> 19:44.906
has a little bit more of what's been
making you so homesick.

19:48.519 --> 19:50.953
Wow!

19:54.425 --> 19:56.791
Look what I can do!

19:56.827 --> 19:59.318
But a million boys can do that.

19:59.363 --> 20:01.991
Look what
an angel can do, Littlest.

20:09.039 --> 20:11.473
Awesome!

20:15.312 --> 20:20.272
You see, Littlest, there are lots
of fun benefits to being an angel.

20:20.317 --> 20:24.777
You mean I can do that too?
How? Show me, Angel Eve.

20:24.822 --> 20:27.916
- Please!
- As with everything in life

20:27.958 --> 20:31.894
and here in the hereafter,
practice makes perfect.

20:31.929 --> 20:34.625
You do already
have the angel power.

20:34.665 --> 20:36.428
Try it.

20:38.402 --> 20:41.496
Ah, it's getting away!

20:44.041 --> 20:46.532
How do I make it
come back to me?

20:46.577 --> 20:49.137
With practice, Littlest.
Just practice.

20:55.919 --> 20:58.046
Wow! Angemals.

21:09.366 --> 21:13.063
Angel Eve, look!
There's the dog.

21:13.103 --> 21:17.130
That's him. He still has
my rope belt around his neck.

21:23.847 --> 21:26.315
Wow! Did you see that?

21:26.350 --> 21:29.410
- He caught my halo.
- A halo for Halo.

21:29.453 --> 21:32.354
- What do you mean?
- He caught your halo

21:32.389 --> 21:35.119
and his name
happens to be Halo too.

21:35.159 --> 21:37.889
- You know him?
- Halo! (whistles)

21:37.928 --> 21:39.953
Please bring Littlest his halo.

21:43.834 --> 21:46.496
(barks)

21:46.537 --> 21:50.735
Hi, Halo. Can I keep him?
Please, Angel Eve?

21:50.774 --> 21:53.902
Can I bring him back
to Celestial City with me?

21:53.944 --> 21:56.208
Can I? Can I, please?

21:56.246 --> 21:58.771
It's a little different
here in heaven.

21:58.816 --> 22:01.614
Here we don't keep pets.

22:01.652 --> 22:05.816
All the animals live free.
They have a beautiful part of heaven

22:05.856 --> 22:09.724
all to themselves right here
in angemal countryside.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.591
(whimpering)

22:11.628 --> 22:14.597
(barks)

22:14.631 --> 22:19.125
But you can come visit this place
and so many other wondrous lands

22:19.169 --> 22:23.299
all over heaven once you've completed
your angel training at the academy.

22:23.340 --> 22:26.935
Now it's time we get back.

22:26.977 --> 22:29.502
Bye, Halo. Bye!

22:41.992 --> 22:44.927
- What's wrong, Littlest?
- Nothing.

22:44.962 --> 22:47.863
Is there anything other than
the dog you'd like to have?

22:47.898 --> 22:50.765
This is heaven, after all.

22:55.472 --> 22:59.169
There's a box I left hidden
in a secret spot back home.

22:59.209 --> 23:03.236
It's filled with treasures I've
collected and it reminds me of home.

23:03.280 --> 23:05.840
I know if I only had them

23:05.883 --> 23:07.646
I wouldn't miss earth so much.

23:07.684 --> 23:11.780
Yes well, I'm not sure that's what you
should be thinking about right now.

23:11.822 --> 23:15.781
Not when there is so much
you still need to accomplish.

23:15.826 --> 23:18.886
Go to class and work hard,
my littlest angel.

23:25.469 --> 23:27.403
Alban:
I'm telling you, Logan,

23:27.437 --> 23:30.167
the littlest angel
must be taught a lesson.

23:30.207 --> 23:32.698
No more Mr. Nice Angel from me.

23:34.011 --> 23:36.707
I've been far too lenient.
When he comes back

23:36.747 --> 23:40.046
I'm going to teach that little
insubordinate that what Alban says

23:40.083 --> 23:41.914
goes at Angel Academy.

23:41.952 --> 23:44.045
Narrator:
And so he thought and thought.

23:44.087 --> 23:46.817
Hmm, maybe there's a way
I can get my box

23:46.857 --> 23:49.451
and fly the highest
in flight training class.

23:49.493 --> 23:52.485
Narrator: And finally he concocted
a devilish little plan

23:52.529 --> 23:56.056
to get back to earth
and find his beloved treasure box...

23:56.099 --> 23:59.000
and get in a little flying practice.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.640
(groans)

24:16.720 --> 24:19.018
I'll never be able to fly
all the way to earth

24:19.056 --> 24:21.991
to get my box
with these puny wings.

24:59.763 --> 25:02.129
(gulps)

25:02.165 --> 25:05.100
- (bell rings)
- Whoa!

25:07.137 --> 25:09.105
(screams)

25:13.443 --> 25:17.880
Wahoo! Look at me.
I'm flying.

25:31.662 --> 25:33.289
Whoa! Uh-oh.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.798
Whoa whoa!

25:35.832 --> 25:39.131
Looks like we got
a little failure to fly.

25:40.303 --> 25:42.168
I got him.

25:48.378 --> 25:51.609
Whoa!

25:51.648 --> 25:53.775
(sputters)

25:57.554 --> 26:01.354
I haven't seen an angel land that hard
since Lucifer got kicked out of heaven.

26:01.391 --> 26:03.484
- (laughs)
- You can talk?!

26:03.527 --> 26:06.223
Of course I can talk.
This is heaven.

26:07.731 --> 26:10.996
So where are you heading
with the faux feathers, little guy?

26:11.034 --> 26:15.937
I'm trying to get to earth, but I'm not
quite sure how to get out of heaven.

26:15.972 --> 26:20.136
Funny, most everyone we know
wants to get into heaven.

26:20.177 --> 26:22.702
- You can talk too?
- Well, me too.

26:22.746 --> 26:24.543
It's heaven, you know?

26:24.581 --> 26:27.516
(high-pitched buzzing)
And us too!

26:27.551 --> 26:30.019
Yeah yeah,
but back to you, flyboy.

26:30.053 --> 26:32.521
Just a wild guess,
but something tells me

26:32.556 --> 26:36.583
you haven't graduated good deed class
to earn your full wings.

26:36.626 --> 26:39.925
Not exactly, but I'm gonna
start trying real hard.

26:39.963 --> 26:44.366
Do you know which way
angels go when they... you know,

26:44.401 --> 26:47.302
- go to earth?
- Oh sure.

26:47.337 --> 26:49.635
But I also know they've got
heavenly reasons

26:49.673 --> 26:52.403
they bop back and forth
between heaven and earth.

26:52.442 --> 26:54.740
Doing God's work.

26:56.613 --> 27:00.640
What happens if an angel has
a really good reason to go to earth,

27:00.684 --> 27:05.053
but hasn't quite done
his three good deeds yet?

27:05.088 --> 27:08.683
Uh, hmm.
Well, to tell you the truth, no idea.

27:08.725 --> 27:10.886
Hey, any of youse
know what happens?

27:10.927 --> 27:14.294
Nope, but I'm sure
it's a really... (braying)

27:14.331 --> 27:17.732
Really bad idea.

27:17.768 --> 27:20.168
Why are you so anxious
to get down there anyway?

27:20.203 --> 27:23.036
I have to get back
my special box.

27:23.073 --> 27:25.405
It's filled with all
my earthly treasures.

27:25.442 --> 27:28.206
Oh, a treasure box, huh?

27:28.245 --> 27:30.440
Yes, and once I've got it,

27:30.480 --> 27:32.778
I know I'll be happy here in heaven.

27:32.816 --> 27:36.684
And I'll be able to try real hard
at Angel Academy.

27:36.720 --> 27:40.918
And I'll do my three good deeds
and I'll earn my wings.

27:40.957 --> 27:43.551
Easy easy. Sheesh.

27:43.593 --> 27:46.153
A type-A angel
if ever there was one.

27:46.196 --> 27:48.721
I get it. The box is
real important to you.

27:48.765 --> 27:53.361
And if I had it, I know I could learn
to shake up and fly right.

27:53.403 --> 27:57.066
I believe that's "shape up
and fly right."

27:57.107 --> 28:00.270
Really really bad idea.

28:00.310 --> 28:03.973
Listen, kid, I may happen
to know a particular cloud

28:04.014 --> 28:07.848
where all the earthbound angels,
you know, come and go from.

28:07.884 --> 28:10.079
Great! Where is it?

28:10.120 --> 28:12.918
- You've got to show me.
- Up in your neck of the clouds.

28:12.956 --> 28:16.323
You know, Celestial City?
I've watched them lots of times.

28:16.359 --> 28:19.192
But I thought angemals
didn't like to go there.

28:19.229 --> 28:22.096
Some of us make the rounds.
Like today,

28:22.132 --> 28:24.464
when you almost
noogified me with that rope.

28:24.501 --> 28:27.265
- Sorry about that.
- Fuggedaboutit.

28:27.304 --> 28:29.329
Bygones and all that
other good stuff.

28:29.372 --> 28:31.272
All right,
now here's what we'll do.

28:31.308 --> 28:33.105
See we've gotta get
together on this thing...

28:33.143 --> 28:35.270
Narrator: And so Halo
and the littlest angel

28:35.312 --> 28:37.644
became friends... fast.

28:40.951 --> 28:43.385
- It's going to be a wonderful day.
- Oh, a beautiful day.

28:49.492 --> 28:51.119
(laughs)

28:53.663 --> 28:55.631
Well, this is it.

28:55.665 --> 28:58.634
Last chance
to change your mind.

29:01.905 --> 29:04.999
The world looks awfully big
from up here, Halo.

29:05.041 --> 29:07.009
How will I find my house?

29:07.043 --> 29:11.275
Huh. You know, I think I've heard
all you do is use your angel vision.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.839
Angel vision? What's that?

29:13.884 --> 29:17.342
To travel to earth using angel vision,
you close your eyes,

29:17.387 --> 29:19.855
picture your exact
landing zone and jump.

29:19.890 --> 29:23.485
Okay, I see my house
just the way it used to be.

29:23.526 --> 29:26.188
Good. Now just
hold your nose and jump.

29:26.229 --> 29:28.629
Any chance
you'd jump first?

29:28.665 --> 29:32.226
Come on in, kid.
The air is fi-iiiine!

29:35.472 --> 29:36.700
(gulps)

29:46.149 --> 29:50.017
- We did it, Halo!
- Yep, we pulled off a heaven break.

29:50.053 --> 29:52.749
Hey, are you sure
we're in the right spot?

29:52.789 --> 29:55.155
My angel vision worked, Halo.

29:55.191 --> 29:57.125
That's my village over there.

29:58.561 --> 30:00.461
Come on, let's fly like the wind.

30:00.497 --> 30:02.795
Whoa whoa whoa,
take it easy, pal.

30:02.832 --> 30:05.232
Remember,
you're still a novice flapper.

30:05.268 --> 30:07.759
Don't worry, I'm... whoa!

30:07.804 --> 30:11.035
- Totally out of control.
Help, Halo!

30:11.074 --> 30:14.305
I knew I should
have been a bird dog.

30:14.344 --> 30:16.312
Hurry, Halo, hurry!

30:18.882 --> 30:21.715
Just relax. I got... whoa!

30:21.751 --> 30:23.309
(grunting)

30:24.921 --> 30:26.684
- My halo!
- What?

30:26.723 --> 30:29.351
Not you, my angel halo.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.587
(both grunting)

30:31.628 --> 30:34.222
Easy does it now.

30:34.264 --> 30:35.788
Whew.

30:35.832 --> 30:39.324
That was... oh no!
Your wings.

30:41.004 --> 30:43.336
Halo, mine are gone too.

30:43.373 --> 30:44.670
What's happening?

30:44.708 --> 30:46.938
Aw, don't worry.
That always happens

30:46.977 --> 30:49.502
when an angel's feet...
or paws... touch earth.

30:49.546 --> 30:52.709
But what are we going to do
without our wings?

30:52.749 --> 30:55.718
How are we gonna get back up
to heaven if we can't fly?

30:55.752 --> 30:59.119
Ah, ye of little faith.
Watch and learn.

30:59.155 --> 31:03.387
All you gotta do is focus real hard...
angel vision, remember?

31:03.426 --> 31:05.291
And... (grunts)

31:06.763 --> 31:08.856
(grunts) Uh-oh.

31:08.898 --> 31:11.628
Hmm, maybe a little less
face scrunching.

31:13.336 --> 31:16.533
Attaboy! But now
make 'em disappear again.

31:16.573 --> 31:18.700
- How come?
- You don't think we're allowed

31:18.742 --> 31:21.040
to run around earth
looking like something

31:21.077 --> 31:23.443
that jumped off
a stained-glass window, do you?

31:24.748 --> 31:28.047
- I get your point.
- And we don't want to break any rules

31:28.084 --> 31:30.450
that could get us locked out
of the pearly gates.

31:30.487 --> 31:32.455
Okay, wings away.

31:34.891 --> 31:37.519
- Uh-oh, halo.
- What?

31:37.560 --> 31:40.427
Not you, that halo.

31:40.463 --> 31:43.159
Angel Eve showed me
how to do this.

31:49.172 --> 31:51.868
Oh, sweet trick.
But that shiny O over your head

31:51.908 --> 31:54.934
is another dead giveaway
you ain't from around here, kid.

31:54.978 --> 31:57.572
Better find someplace
really safe to hide it.

32:00.183 --> 32:02.481
I know the perfect place!

32:02.519 --> 32:05.010
I'll hide my halo on my Halo.

32:05.055 --> 32:06.545
Huh?

32:09.125 --> 32:11.525
Now it just looks like
your dog collar.

32:11.561 --> 32:14.928
Okay, time to go play
fetch the treasure box.

32:14.964 --> 32:17.023
So which way?

32:17.067 --> 32:19.695
I kinda got turned around
when we were landing.

32:19.736 --> 32:21.863
Well, crashing.

32:21.905 --> 32:26.501
But I'm pretty sure
it's just over the next hill.

32:27.710 --> 32:30.304
Narrator: And so
the littlest angel and his new friend

32:30.346 --> 32:34.043
set out to find his home,
see the places he used to play

32:34.084 --> 32:37.019
and retrieve
the missing treasure box.

32:37.053 --> 32:39.647
But they would soon remember
that heaven and earth

32:39.689 --> 32:42.351
are two very different
sorts of places.

32:49.199 --> 32:51.064
(growls)

32:51.101 --> 32:55.333
It wasn't over the next hill
or next or the next after that either.

32:55.371 --> 32:57.236
I never thought I'd say it,

32:57.273 --> 32:59.867
but I sure miss my angel wings.

32:59.909 --> 33:04.369
I don't see why it would hurt
to fly up and see where my village is.

33:04.414 --> 33:06.814
Nope. Huh-uh.
Rotten idea.

33:06.850 --> 33:08.545
What if some human saw you?

33:08.585 --> 33:10.917
How are you gonna explain
a boy with wings?

33:10.954 --> 33:13.388
I guess you're right.

33:13.423 --> 33:14.890
Of course I'm right.
Come on.

33:14.924 --> 33:17.484
Don't know if it's your village,
but my super sniffer's

33:17.527 --> 33:19.825
- picking up people scents.
- Which way?

33:19.863 --> 33:22.525
Just over the next hill.

33:26.836 --> 33:30.602
We'll just go up to the house
and ask directions to my village.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.734
I might as well ask them
if they can spare an old bone too.

33:33.776 --> 33:38.042
Wait, a talking dog on earth
might seem kind of strange.

33:38.081 --> 33:41.539
You'd better just stick to growls
and barks when people are around.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.314
Gee, I kinda got used
to speaking my mind.

33:44.354 --> 33:47.346
I hope I can remember
how to act like a regular old dog.

33:47.390 --> 33:50.791
Maybe it'd be better to ask
the barnyard animals instead.

33:50.827 --> 33:53.421
Let me think here.
(barking)

33:55.265 --> 33:57.062
They won't understand me.

33:57.100 --> 34:00.399
Earth animals can't talk
like angel animals can.

34:00.436 --> 34:03.303
No sweat. I still remember
how to talk turkey,

34:03.339 --> 34:06.103
and lots of
other critters' tongues too.

34:12.614 --> 34:14.583
(snoring)

34:14.617 --> 34:17.585
I'll just ask this goose
and cow which way.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.485
(barking)

34:21.658 --> 34:23.956
- (cow bellowing)
- (goose honking)

34:23.993 --> 34:26.154
That cow sure sounds mad.

34:31.367 --> 34:33.891
- Maybe because he's a bull.
- (bellows)

34:34.938 --> 34:37.202
- What are they saying?
- Loosely translated:

34:37.239 --> 34:39.400
No trespassing.
Get lost.

34:39.442 --> 34:40.739
Run!

34:45.514 --> 34:47.346
(honking)

35:05.068 --> 35:07.628
I think we lost 'em.

35:07.670 --> 35:10.002
Good, but you forgot
to tell them.

35:10.039 --> 35:12.269
- Run!
- (honking, bellowing)

35:18.348 --> 35:21.840
Come on,
no way bulls can climb trees.

35:21.884 --> 35:23.476
Uh, neither can dogs.

35:23.519 --> 35:25.987
Hey, there aren't
any humans around.

35:26.022 --> 35:28.820
Why can't we use our... wings!

35:28.858 --> 35:30.291
Halo, look out!

35:34.364 --> 35:36.389
- (bellowing)
- (honking)

35:39.969 --> 35:42.961
Guess it serves him right
for being so mean.

35:43.006 --> 35:45.440
But I kinda feel sorry for him.

35:45.475 --> 35:48.239
I guess we should
try and get him free.

35:48.278 --> 35:51.338
(growls) I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

35:56.286 --> 35:58.880
Littlest:
Okay, one, two,

35:58.921 --> 36:01.151
three, pull!

36:01.190 --> 36:03.590
(all straining)

36:03.626 --> 36:05.992
Halo: Come on.

36:09.399 --> 36:11.458
(whimpers)

36:16.339 --> 36:18.307
We're crunchy kibble now.

36:18.341 --> 36:20.605
Oh, prepare to be noogified.

36:21.678 --> 36:23.168
Huh?

36:24.213 --> 36:26.579
(honks)

36:29.552 --> 36:32.919
- What did they say?
- The village is... (groans)

36:32.955 --> 36:35.116
Right over the next hill.

36:37.260 --> 36:40.093
It's already night
and kind of dark out.

36:40.129 --> 36:42.791
Maybe we should
wait till morning.

36:42.832 --> 36:45.767
Yeah good, 'cause I'm dog-tired.

36:45.802 --> 36:47.963
(yawns)

36:51.407 --> 36:54.467
Littlest:
It's weird looking up at heaven.

36:58.114 --> 37:00.548
Huh? Hmmm.

37:01.684 --> 37:04.983
I wonder if anybody
even noticed we're gone.

37:19.202 --> 37:21.966
When I get my hands
on that little angel, I'll...

37:22.004 --> 37:24.268
- (gasps)
- (trumpet blowing)

37:24.307 --> 37:26.673
Wait, what's that?

37:26.709 --> 37:28.267
Could this be him?

37:30.046 --> 37:32.105
(trumpet continues)

37:33.649 --> 37:35.617
Hear ye, hear ye!

37:35.651 --> 37:38.882
God has decreed
the most glorious event

37:38.921 --> 37:41.321
for all the citizens of earth.

37:41.357 --> 37:43.188
He has requested

37:43.226 --> 37:45.888
all angels in his firmament

37:45.928 --> 37:48.226
to prepare the most wonderful

37:48.264 --> 37:50.960
celebration of all time.

37:51.000 --> 37:53.969
Bring your most splendid gifts.

37:54.003 --> 37:57.632
What?
What is the celebration for?

37:57.673 --> 38:00.733
You know God will announce
His plan in His own time.

38:00.777 --> 38:04.178
But I got word that it'll be soon.
In the meantime,

38:04.213 --> 38:06.875
prepare your gifts!

38:06.916 --> 38:09.316
Prepare
for the greatest celebration

38:09.352 --> 38:12.014
heaven and earth
have ever known.

38:12.054 --> 38:13.885
(trumpet blares)

38:13.923 --> 38:16.551
Oh ho, of all the days.

38:19.929 --> 38:21.521
- (music playing)
- Logan!

38:21.564 --> 38:24.089
Logan...

38:24.133 --> 38:28.092
please, get your big sandals
off my desk.

38:28.137 --> 38:30.731
This is insufferable, intolerable,

38:30.773 --> 38:33.298
inexcusable, in... in...

38:33.342 --> 38:35.708
- in...
- Uh, inviting?

38:35.745 --> 38:39.408
- Interns? Investments?
- What are you rambling about?

38:39.449 --> 38:42.577
I thought we were trying to think
of words starting with "in."

38:42.618 --> 38:46.054
Didn't you hear the messenger angel
who just blew in here?

38:46.088 --> 38:49.251
Sorry, I was listening to
"Hey Hey, Get Off of my Cloud."

38:49.292 --> 38:53.422
God has just announced
the biggest, most exciting event

38:53.463 --> 38:57.524
He's ever planned for earth.
And heaven needs to start preparations.

38:57.567 --> 38:59.398
I love celebrations!

38:59.435 --> 39:02.802
I hope we get to wear party hats
and blow those funny whistles

39:02.839 --> 39:04.431
- that shoot out...
- Ahem!

39:04.474 --> 39:06.442
We need to find that
missing little angel

39:06.476 --> 39:08.307
and get him back here
to the academy.

39:08.344 --> 39:11.438
Everything must be absolutely
perfect for God's big day.

39:11.481 --> 39:15.247
Don't worry. The little tyke has
to be around heaven someplace.

39:15.284 --> 39:16.842
Where else could he go?

39:16.886 --> 39:19.116
- (smacks)
- (yawns)

39:20.122 --> 39:23.922
Well, if I bore you that much,
I'll just be on my way then.

39:23.960 --> 39:27.760
Guess we can look for the littlest guy
first thing in the morning.

39:27.797 --> 39:29.025
Hmph!

39:30.233 --> 39:31.894
(birds chirping)

39:32.969 --> 39:34.698
(snores)

39:38.774 --> 39:40.799
(rooster crowing)

39:47.483 --> 39:51.146
Come on, Halo.
Just one more hill and we're there.

39:51.187 --> 39:54.486
(growls)
I'll believe that when I see it.

39:56.025 --> 39:58.755
I can hardly wait
to see my house again

39:58.794 --> 40:01.592
- and get my box.
- (bellows)

40:01.631 --> 40:05.226
- Uh-oh.
- Goose: Yeehaw!

40:05.268 --> 40:07.896
(honking)

40:07.937 --> 40:11.065
- (snorts)
- What was that all about?

40:11.107 --> 40:13.632
They just wanted to say thanks
for the good deed

40:13.676 --> 40:16.270
- and warn us to be careful.
- Of what?

40:16.312 --> 40:18.337
- A guard goose and a bull?
- I don't know.

40:18.381 --> 40:21.043
It didn't make much sense to me.
Some cruel creep

40:21.083 --> 40:24.382
that uses critters for show?
Whatever the heck that means.

40:29.191 --> 40:31.659
(carnival sounds)

40:40.202 --> 40:42.864
Step right up.

40:42.905 --> 40:45.635
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

40:45.675 --> 40:47.870
See the one and only
two-headed snake

40:47.910 --> 40:51.107
and the amazing talking chicken.

40:52.148 --> 40:54.378
I didn't hear
no chicken talking.

40:54.417 --> 40:56.544
Just drop in your coins

40:56.586 --> 40:59.521
then the chicken will
thank you personally.

41:04.460 --> 41:08.954
Brok! Bok bok!
Look at me, I'm a talking chicken.

41:08.998 --> 41:10.590
Brok!
Bok bok bok bok!

41:14.403 --> 41:17.998
Aw, it's a big fake.
The chicken's lips aren't even moving.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.838
Hey, we've been gypped.
Give us our money back!

41:22.311 --> 41:24.711
- I didn't hear any chicken talk.
- (crowd clamoring)

41:24.747 --> 41:27.910
Yeah, you just weren't
watching carefully.

41:27.950 --> 41:30.009
Move your lips, chicken.

41:31.520 --> 41:34.182
Flap your blasted beak, bird!

41:34.223 --> 41:36.783
(squawking)

41:37.960 --> 41:39.757
(crowd gasps)

41:40.796 --> 41:42.195
What?

41:42.231 --> 41:44.358
(crowd booing)

41:44.400 --> 41:46.334
(choking)

41:46.369 --> 41:49.395
Stop, wait, come back!

41:49.438 --> 41:52.532
- It's all part of the show.
- (coughing)

41:53.976 --> 41:55.967
What were you thinking, woman?

41:56.012 --> 41:59.675
Oh, don't tell me you swallowed
the fake snake head again.

41:59.715 --> 42:01.580
Don't you know
we need it for the show?

42:01.617 --> 42:03.881
(wheezes)

42:05.755 --> 42:09.213
I warned you, Creepedeep.
No one is going to fall

42:09.258 --> 42:13.957
for that phony two-headed snake
or your pathetic ventriloquist act.

42:13.996 --> 42:17.090
Mind your own business,
muscle-head.

42:17.133 --> 42:19.897
This traveling show
is my business.

42:19.935 --> 42:23.666
And I'm warning you, unless you
come up with a real attraction,

42:23.706 --> 42:26.004
you two are out of here.

42:28.110 --> 42:30.772
Heh heh heh heh.
He'll see.

42:30.813 --> 42:33.179
One of these days
I'm going to find

42:33.215 --> 42:35.740
the greatest attraction of all time!

42:47.630 --> 42:51.828
What if the people that live here now
already found your special box?

42:51.867 --> 42:56.600
No way! I kept it hidden underneath
a loose floorboard in my bedroom.

42:56.639 --> 42:59.733
- I'll just slip inside and...
- Whoa there, little pup.

42:59.775 --> 43:02.801
Even though your wings aren't showing,
you're still an angel.

43:02.845 --> 43:05.279
So breaking into houses
is a "no can do."

43:05.314 --> 43:07.373
(metallic humming)

43:10.786 --> 43:12.845
What's going on?

43:12.888 --> 43:15.618
Looks like your other halo
agrees with me.

43:18.294 --> 43:20.285
Yep, no doubt about it.

43:20.329 --> 43:22.490
But we're not really breaking in.

43:22.531 --> 43:24.499
See, the window's wide open.

43:27.036 --> 43:30.938
Plus it's not like I'm stealing
since the box is really mine.

43:40.916 --> 43:43.578
- Guess that means it's all right.
- Good.

43:43.619 --> 43:46.520
Then I'll just look inside
and make sure no one's there.

43:50.259 --> 43:52.284
Whoa!

43:52.328 --> 43:55.024
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Come on.

43:55.064 --> 43:57.157
I got a bad feeling about this,

43:57.199 --> 43:59.429
but a friend looks out for a friend.

44:02.705 --> 44:05.003
- (grunts)
- (meows)

44:05.040 --> 44:07.508
I thought you said
nobody was here.

44:09.078 --> 44:11.911
- Eh, it's just a little cat.
- (yowls)

44:12.948 --> 44:15.348
Don't you know most
earth cats and dogs...

44:15.384 --> 44:18.376
(snarls)
- Like to fight like cats and dogs?

44:18.420 --> 44:21.514
- Shh, we don't want anybody hearing us.
- (door opens)

44:21.557 --> 44:24.219
Woman: Ahhh!
Someone's in my house! Help!

44:26.662 --> 44:29.153
I got it.

44:29.198 --> 44:31.428
We'll never make it this way.

44:31.467 --> 44:34.527
Then we'll have to go out
the front before...

44:34.570 --> 44:36.800
- Gotcha!
- What do we do now?

44:36.839 --> 44:39.967
What earth dogs do best...
chase cats.

44:40.009 --> 44:42.307
- Come here, kitty. (barking)
- (hissing)

44:45.514 --> 44:47.505
- (growls)
- Why you...

44:49.585 --> 44:52.076
- (barks)
- So sorry.

44:52.121 --> 44:54.715
Stop!
In the name of the law.

44:54.757 --> 44:57.624
Oh, who am I kidding?
I'll never catch them.

45:07.903 --> 45:12.465
This is your last chance.
Confess or else!

45:12.508 --> 45:15.944
- Or else what?
- Good question.

45:15.978 --> 45:19.607
Argh, would you just tell me
where the littlest angel is?

45:19.648 --> 45:23.880
- We can't.
- Then I'll just have to make you talk.

45:23.919 --> 45:25.784
Ahh, what are you doing?

45:25.821 --> 45:27.721
I am, after all, still a hero.

45:27.756 --> 45:30.486
So I can't let you frighten
the poor little creatures,

45:30.526 --> 45:32.960
even if they are
just dumb animals.

45:32.995 --> 45:34.758
Look who's calling us dumb.

45:34.797 --> 45:37.766
Now promise you won't hurt
the nice critters.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.995
Fine. Just put me down.

45:40.035 --> 45:41.764
Okay.

45:45.908 --> 45:49.400
Well, if you refuse to tell me
where the littlest angel is,

45:49.445 --> 45:52.107
at least give him
a message for me.

45:52.147 --> 45:54.377
How can we when he's so far...

45:54.416 --> 45:57.317
- (muffled)
- Aha! I knew it.

45:57.353 --> 46:00.254
You do know where he is.

46:01.490 --> 46:03.754
Kinda, but don't blame us

46:03.792 --> 46:07.159
since it's mostly your fault
that he's gone.

46:07.196 --> 46:08.959
(laughs)
My fault?

46:08.998 --> 46:12.764
That's right, Alban. Maybe if you'd
been nicer to the little fella,

46:12.801 --> 46:15.235
he would have felt like
he fit in up here.

46:15.271 --> 46:20.072
Then he wouldn't have been so sad
that he missed his home,

46:20.109 --> 46:23.738
his box and his earthly memories.

46:23.779 --> 46:26.270
Have you ever heard such nonsen...

46:26.315 --> 46:28.545
Poor little Littlest.
(sobbing)

46:28.584 --> 46:32.987
- (blows nose)
- I don't care about some silly box!

46:33.022 --> 46:34.853
Just tell me where the boy went.

46:34.890 --> 46:37.620
That's what we're trying to do.

46:37.660 --> 46:40.026
You wanna hear the story or not?

46:40.062 --> 46:42.792
Oooh, I love a good tale.

46:42.831 --> 46:46.494
I want to hear the whole story
from the very beginning. Please!

46:46.535 --> 46:48.833
So he went to earth...

46:48.871 --> 46:53.240
Narrator: So the mule told the angels
everything he and the ox had seen.

46:53.275 --> 46:56.904
And miracle of miracles,
what do you know?

46:56.946 --> 46:58.607
It even seemed to have

46:58.647 --> 47:01.115
a softening effect on Angel Alban.

47:02.418 --> 47:06.548
...and that's the whole sad story.

47:08.057 --> 47:12.687
Ahem, yes well, perhaps I have been
a tiny touch too strict with...

47:12.728 --> 47:16.892
Saints preserve us,
at last I've found you.

47:16.932 --> 47:20.231
Half of heaven has been searching
for you, Angel Alban.

47:20.269 --> 47:23.761
Really? I had no idea
I was so popular.

47:23.806 --> 47:26.206
God's announced
what the big celebration is

47:26.241 --> 47:28.641
- and you weren't there.
- What?

47:28.677 --> 47:30.201
What is it? I can't wait.

47:30.245 --> 47:32.805
And I hope
it involves party hats!

47:32.848 --> 47:35.817
God's only son is going
to be born on earth

47:35.851 --> 47:38.718
to help spread peace
to all mankind.

47:38.754 --> 47:41.985
Hats! I knew it.
It's a birthday.

47:42.024 --> 47:44.788
And birthdays
always mean party hats.

47:44.827 --> 47:49.196
You're supposed to be over at the Great
Hall helping the decorating committee.

47:50.566 --> 47:54.058
Oh! And every one of the angels
in your academy are supposed

47:54.103 --> 47:58.233
to prepare a special gift
for the baby Jesus!

47:58.273 --> 48:00.867
Y-yes... no!

48:00.909 --> 48:04.538
Oh, I'm ruined!
I may even lose my wings.

48:05.948 --> 48:08.348
Oh, this is all his fault.

48:08.384 --> 48:11.012
Where on earth could he be?

48:11.053 --> 48:13.681
I don't know.
It's a pretty big place.

48:13.722 --> 48:16.589
Oh, don't be silly.
It's just an expression.

48:16.625 --> 48:19.685
I mean, he couldn't have actually
jumped cloud and... (gasps)

48:19.728 --> 48:22.219
Ridiculous to even consider.

48:22.264 --> 48:23.959
Absolutely impossible...

48:23.999 --> 48:26.126
(gulps)
- I pray.

48:31.040 --> 48:33.975
(elephant trumpets)

48:35.878 --> 48:37.709
(panting)

48:37.746 --> 48:40.647
I think we lost him.

48:41.683 --> 48:44.618
Now I don't want to say
I'm an ace problem solver,

48:44.653 --> 48:47.781
but if good old King Solomon
ever needed advice,

48:47.823 --> 48:50.656
I'm definitely the dog to call.

48:56.932 --> 48:59.162
Look out below-oooh!

49:00.202 --> 49:04.263
Watch it! You almost...
my treasures!

49:04.306 --> 49:05.864
Did someone say treasure?

49:11.046 --> 49:14.038
- Mine!
- Thanks for catching my box, mister.

49:14.083 --> 49:16.347
I don't know
what you're talking about.

49:16.385 --> 49:19.013
This is my box.
Take a hike, kid.

49:19.054 --> 49:21.522
That's my box
and I can prove it.

49:21.557 --> 49:24.458
I said scram!
And take that mangy mutt with you.

49:24.493 --> 49:27.053
(growls)

49:32.634 --> 49:34.864
What's going on here, Creepedeep?

49:34.903 --> 49:38.168
This kid and his vicious dog
tried to steal my box.

49:38.207 --> 49:40.937
And I'm sure they snuck in
without buying a ticket.

49:40.976 --> 49:43.444
Is that true?
You got a ticket?

49:43.479 --> 49:45.811
- No, but that's my box!
- Hit the road

49:45.848 --> 49:49.011
or I'll have to call the guard.
Guard! Guard!

49:49.051 --> 49:51.417
- Guard?
- (barks)

49:51.453 --> 49:54.889
But it's not fair.
He stole my box.

49:54.923 --> 49:57.949
I know, but nothing we can
do about it right now.

50:00.762 --> 50:02.389
(maniacal laugh)

50:11.940 --> 50:14.909
Creepedeep: Blast it!
There's no treasure here.

50:14.943 --> 50:18.640
No gold, no gems,
just a bunch of bric-a-brac.

50:18.680 --> 50:23.310
Well, that's what you get
for stealing from a poor little child.

50:23.352 --> 50:24.512
(laughter)

50:24.553 --> 50:27.886
Oh, like you'd care a rat's backside

50:27.923 --> 50:30.858
about the kid if there turned
out to be real treasure.

50:30.893 --> 50:33.760
Mrs. Creepedeep: Hmph, like you
could ever find a real treasure

50:33.795 --> 50:36.593
or a real attraction for that matter.

50:39.601 --> 50:41.091
Ehh.

50:43.472 --> 50:46.999
It just so happens
I'm onto something really big.

50:47.042 --> 50:51.001
It's going to make me rich as a king.
(laughs)

50:52.347 --> 50:55.077
If I had a coin
for every time I heard that,

50:55.117 --> 50:56.880
I would be rich.

50:58.520 --> 51:01.353
Oh yeah?
Well, you just wait and see.

51:06.695 --> 51:09.391
(shudders)
Those two give me an itch.

51:09.431 --> 51:12.093
Well, at least we know
where the box is.

51:19.908 --> 51:23.571
Now let's just try and stay awake
till they fall asleep.

51:24.913 --> 51:27.279
(snoring)

51:34.489 --> 51:38.118
Now let's just try and stay awake
till they fall asleep.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.149
Then what do we do?

51:39.194 --> 51:41.822
Trust me.
Those two Creepedeeps

51:41.863 --> 51:44.388
are more than a few arches
short of a cathedral,

51:44.433 --> 51:45.866
if you catch my drift.

51:45.901 --> 51:48.665
This'll be like taking
candy from a baby.

51:48.704 --> 51:52.265
Not that you'd know anything
about something like that.

51:52.307 --> 51:54.070
Right?

51:54.109 --> 51:57.010
Me? Of course not.

51:57.045 --> 51:59.036
Hey, I got into heaven, didn't I?

51:59.081 --> 52:02.812
You think every Tom, Dick and hairy mutt
gets through those pearly gates?

52:02.851 --> 52:04.978
I don't think so.

52:05.020 --> 52:07.989
- No, I guess not.
- (yawns)

52:10.626 --> 52:12.560
- Halo?
- Yeah?

52:13.762 --> 52:15.821
Did you have... you know,

52:15.864 --> 52:19.527
- a boy or a girl back when you...
- No, I was on my own.

52:19.568 --> 52:23.004
Fancy-free, living in the city,
nothing to tie me down.

52:23.038 --> 52:25.563
Went where I wanted
and did what I wanted.

52:25.607 --> 52:28.007
Hmm, because
the Good Book says

52:28.043 --> 52:31.911
though one may be overpowered,
two can defend themselves.

52:31.947 --> 52:34.677
Oh, what are you Good Booking me
at this time of night for?

52:34.716 --> 52:36.911
Nothing.
I'm just saying

52:36.952 --> 52:40.115
it's really good to have
a friend you can count on.

52:44.726 --> 52:46.921
(snoring)

52:48.530 --> 52:53.126
And when we get back to heaven,
I'm really gonna start trying harder.

52:53.168 --> 52:57.628
Yeah, I know what you mean, Littlest.
I know what you mean.

53:20.162 --> 53:21.925
Looks like we're in luck.

53:32.374 --> 53:34.968
- Look out.
- (yelps)

53:35.010 --> 53:37.410
- Halo!
- Keep going, Littlest!

53:37.446 --> 53:40.973
Better listen to the talking dog,
kid, and hit the road.

53:41.016 --> 53:43.780
- (laughs)
- I can't just leave you.

53:43.819 --> 53:45.218
- (whip cracks)
- Get going

53:45.253 --> 53:46.914
unless you want to feel my whip.

53:46.955 --> 53:48.422
Save yourself, kid.

53:52.027 --> 53:54.518
Heh heh heh,
I knew you two were hiding

53:54.563 --> 53:57.123
something bigger than
that so-called treasure.

53:57.165 --> 53:59.759
But this is even better
than I dreamed.

53:59.801 --> 54:01.632
- A talking dog!
- (snarls)

54:01.670 --> 54:04.036
You're messing with
the wrong mongrel, mister.

54:04.072 --> 54:07.098
I'll go devil dog on you.
(growling)

54:09.578 --> 54:13.036
- Why you...
- Save your stupid threats for the show.

54:14.049 --> 54:17.041
No way I'm leaving earth
without my best friend.

54:17.085 --> 54:20.919
But what can I do all alone
against that big bully?

54:23.992 --> 54:26.893
What do you think
you're doing now?

54:26.928 --> 54:28.555
See this dog?

54:28.597 --> 54:32.192
This is the attraction
I've been waiting for my whole life.

54:32.234 --> 54:34.361
I've heard that one before.

54:34.403 --> 54:38.169
Yeah? Well, you've never
heard a talking dog before.

54:38.206 --> 54:42.142
Hello!
I'm a talking chicken, remember?

54:42.177 --> 54:45.169
This isn't a fake.
This dog really talks.

54:45.213 --> 54:47.647
Just listen for once in your life.

54:47.682 --> 54:50.116
- Tell her.
- (barking)

54:52.721 --> 54:54.450
Ugh.

54:54.489 --> 54:56.423
(gasps)
Amazing!

54:56.458 --> 54:59.018
He's talking in tongues.

54:59.060 --> 55:01.961
Talking dog, my foot!

55:01.997 --> 55:04.227
Oh, Mother was right.

55:04.266 --> 55:06.393
I married a nincompoop.

55:08.503 --> 55:11.028
Talk, you miserable mutt,

55:11.072 --> 55:12.699
or I'll...

55:12.741 --> 55:14.538
(gasps)
What?

55:14.576 --> 55:16.669
What's going on?

55:16.711 --> 55:18.235
It's working.

55:18.280 --> 55:21.613
Wha... wha... wha...
ho... ho... how?

55:28.123 --> 55:30.683
(groans)

55:30.725 --> 55:33.956
- Are you okay, Halo?
- Wait wait wait, are you talking to me

55:33.995 --> 55:35.986
- or the other halo?
- Both.

55:36.031 --> 55:38.363
Thanks.

55:39.568 --> 55:41.661
We'd better blow this freak show.

55:41.703 --> 55:43.500
You've still got
your treasure box, right?

55:43.538 --> 55:45.062
It's safe and sound.

55:45.106 --> 55:47.540
Then let's make wings
and flap for home.

55:50.745 --> 55:53.543
- (gasps)
- Littlest! Littlest!

55:53.582 --> 55:57.780
Now this is what I call
the greatest attraction on earth...

55:57.819 --> 56:00.219
a real live angel!

56:00.255 --> 56:02.189
Littlest:
Keep going, Halo!

56:02.224 --> 56:04.351
Don't stop
or they'll catch you too.

56:05.494 --> 56:07.985
Huh? It can't be.

56:09.064 --> 56:11.931
A talking dog with wings.

56:13.068 --> 56:16.231
Halo: Uh-oh, I don't think
I can handle the two of them.

56:16.271 --> 56:19.672
Hey, he's getting away.
Do something.

56:19.708 --> 56:21.733
Oh, forget that mutt.

56:21.776 --> 56:23.676
Quick, you'd better hide.

56:24.713 --> 56:27.409
I can't believe you just stood there

56:27.449 --> 56:29.280
while the fortune flew away.

56:29.317 --> 56:32.980
Who cares?
I just netted a gold mine.

56:33.021 --> 56:34.921
(groans)

56:37.259 --> 56:41.059
I bagged myself a real live angel.
(laughs)

56:41.096 --> 56:43.530
Gee, I don't see any angel.

56:43.565 --> 56:46.398
And no one else is ever
gonna see one either.

56:46.434 --> 56:50.029
Whoa! Hey, stop!

56:50.071 --> 56:52.266
Don't kid yourself, kid.

56:52.307 --> 56:55.936
You'll sprout those wings
the minute I order you to.

56:55.977 --> 56:59.538
I won't do it!
You don't scare me.

56:59.581 --> 57:03.108
Oh, I don't scare you, hmm?

57:03.151 --> 57:05.176
Well, why don't you ask them two

57:05.220 --> 57:07.950
what happens
when they disobey me?

57:07.989 --> 57:10.014
Bok bok bok bok bok.

57:10.058 --> 57:12.219
Oh, you'll pop those wings

57:12.260 --> 57:15.627
or I'll find a way
to rip 'em out of you.

57:15.664 --> 57:17.996
She's not that cruel.

57:18.033 --> 57:21.025
Or is she?

57:51.833 --> 57:56.065
Remember, my little angels,
place the gifts in an orderly pile.

57:57.105 --> 57:58.197
- Oh!
- Oooh.

57:58.239 --> 57:59.729
- Outta my way.
- Ah!

57:59.774 --> 58:01.071
Coming through here.

58:01.109 --> 58:02.872
What is the meaning of... ooof!

58:04.546 --> 58:08.346
Look, Alban, it's a doggy.
Here, doggy doggy.

58:10.352 --> 58:13.378
- Is he for real?
- Unfortunately.

58:13.421 --> 58:16.913
How dare you barge
into the Great Hall and paw me?

58:16.958 --> 58:19.222
Hey, not my idea
of heaven either, pal.

58:19.260 --> 58:21.057
But your friend and my friend,

58:21.096 --> 58:24.065
the littlest angel, is
in big trouble back on earth.

58:24.099 --> 58:26.033
We have to rescue him
right now!

58:27.168 --> 58:29.693
- Alban?
- Oh dear, it's Angel Eve.

58:29.738 --> 58:31.899
Logan, get this mutt out of here.

58:35.644 --> 58:39.341
Fine, then I guess I'll just
have to tell my troubles to...

58:39.381 --> 58:43.044
(whistles)
Oh, Angel Eve?

58:43.084 --> 58:44.073
Oh!

58:46.154 --> 58:50.454
Halo, no, she mustn't
know anything's wrong.

58:50.492 --> 58:52.653
Then you'd better help
save the littlest angel.

58:52.694 --> 58:54.252
Tick tock, time's running out.

58:54.295 --> 58:57.059
All right. Shhh.
Just keep your snout...

58:57.098 --> 58:58.759
Alban, did you call me?

58:58.800 --> 59:01.394
Me?!
No, definitely wasn't me.

59:01.436 --> 59:03.427
Logan and I were just
helping this dog

59:03.471 --> 59:05.302
find the way out out out!

59:12.480 --> 59:14.948
Hey, glands-for-brains,

59:14.983 --> 59:16.416
- ya mind?
- Not at all.

59:16.451 --> 59:20.080
I'm quite strong, you know.
I could carry you all day.

59:20.121 --> 59:23.113
- Down, boy.
- Oh!

59:25.160 --> 59:27.287
All right, so what do you know

59:27.328 --> 59:30.456
about the whereabouts
of that little wing-tipped wonder?

59:30.498 --> 59:34.298
He's on earth near his old village
and rescuing him ain't gonna be easy.

59:34.335 --> 59:37.133
Alert the troops.
Let the battle begin.

59:37.172 --> 59:40.903
Shush! Quiet!
No one can know what's happened.

59:40.942 --> 59:44.241
Even better!
A secret mission.

59:44.279 --> 59:47.009
To battle!

59:50.919 --> 59:54.821
My, how I've missed having
a good cause to fight for.

59:54.856 --> 59:56.380
Onward.

59:56.424 --> 59:58.358
Er, downward.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:15.466
I really blew it this time.

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:19.037
All I wanted was my special box
to remind me of home.

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:23.710
But now I've lost the best friend
I ever had

01:00:23.752 --> 01:00:25.481
and I'm all alone.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.014
No offense, but I really miss Halo.

01:00:31.059 --> 01:00:33.323
(sighs)

01:00:33.361 --> 01:00:35.852
But I've still got my other halo!

01:00:35.897 --> 01:00:38.195
I hope.

01:00:38.233 --> 01:00:40.895
Thank heaven you're still here.

01:00:40.935 --> 01:00:44.063
Let's see
if you like playing fetch too.

01:00:47.342 --> 01:00:50.004
That's it!
You got the key.

01:00:50.044 --> 01:00:53.377
And I've got my box.

01:00:53.414 --> 01:00:56.440
Thanks. You're the best.

01:00:58.787 --> 01:01:00.812
Bok. Bok bok.

01:01:01.956 --> 01:01:04.789
- Come on, let's get out of...
- Bok bok!

01:01:05.794 --> 01:01:09.423
- Bok bok bok bok.
- Sorry, there's no time.

01:01:09.464 --> 01:01:11.955
Bok bok bok bok.

01:01:19.707 --> 01:01:23.541
But I can't leave you
with those cruel Creepedeeps.

01:01:24.879 --> 01:01:27.245
- Stop, grab him!
- (gasps)

01:01:27.282 --> 01:01:29.512
- (grunts)
- Bok bok bok!

01:01:33.254 --> 01:01:36.781
- Too late.
- Mrs. Creepedeep: You grab that kid.

01:01:36.825 --> 01:01:39.157
- (grunts)
- Whoa.

01:01:45.767 --> 01:01:47.257
- Stop him!
- Stop! Grab him!

01:01:47.302 --> 01:01:48.963
Come back here.

01:01:51.239 --> 01:01:54.003
(groans)
Don't let him get away.

01:01:56.211 --> 01:02:00.307
I can't use my wings
without really breaking the rules.

01:02:00.348 --> 01:02:03.408
- Don't let him get away!
- (all clamoring)

01:02:04.752 --> 01:02:06.583
- Faster.
- You grab that kid.

01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:09.590
- Don't let him get away.
- Just gotta get my wings and...

01:02:09.624 --> 01:02:11.649
uh-oh.

01:02:11.693 --> 01:02:14.218
- Don't let him get away.
- After him.

01:02:17.198 --> 01:02:18.995
- Cut him off.
- Grab that kid.

01:02:24.873 --> 01:02:27.341
Where is the miniature
mischief-maker?

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:32.207
- Oh now... (whimpers)
- (hissing)

01:02:33.815 --> 01:02:36.306
(barks)

01:02:36.351 --> 01:02:38.080
(hisses)

01:02:39.454 --> 01:02:41.251
He says
they went thattaway.

01:02:41.289 --> 01:02:43.314
(panting)

01:02:46.327 --> 01:02:48.795
- (trumpets)
- Whoa whoa!

01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:55.935
(grunts)

01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:57.699
(creaking)

01:02:57.739 --> 01:03:00.003
- Come back here.
- Hey hey, stop him.

01:03:02.043 --> 01:03:04.068
- (screams)
- (groaning)

01:03:05.413 --> 01:03:07.313
(laughs)

01:03:09.183 --> 01:03:10.309
(grunts)

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:14.150
(popping)

01:03:18.793 --> 01:03:20.283
Gotcha!

01:03:27.402 --> 01:03:29.165
Whoa!

01:03:34.509 --> 01:03:36.568
Alban:
Back off, buster.

01:03:39.113 --> 01:03:40.580
Ha ha ha! You?

01:03:40.615 --> 01:03:42.879
(laughs)
Gonna stop me?

01:03:44.419 --> 01:03:48.583
- Wimp.
- We'll see who the wimp is here.

01:03:48.623 --> 01:03:50.386
Show him, Logan.

01:03:51.592 --> 01:03:53.753
Hey, put me down.

01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:58.157
(screaming)
Mama!

01:03:58.199 --> 01:04:00.531
Get ready to meet your maker.

01:04:00.568 --> 01:04:02.832
(screaming)

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:10.307
Uh-oh.

01:04:10.345 --> 01:04:12.006
(cheering)

01:04:15.717 --> 01:04:19.118
Thank you. Thank you.
I can do two shows a night

01:04:19.153 --> 01:04:22.816
- with a matinee on Saturday.
- Hello, anyone in there?

01:04:22.857 --> 01:04:27.055
This is no time for theatrics.
We've got to get back to you-know-where.

01:04:27.095 --> 01:04:29.962
Ooops, sorry.
Previous engagement calls.

01:04:29.998 --> 01:04:32.626
But how can we fly
with everyone staring at us?

01:04:34.469 --> 01:04:37.700
- Follow me.
- I do not take orders from...

01:04:37.739 --> 01:04:40.299
oh, what the heck.

01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:51.609
He wants to ride
the Ferris wheel now.

01:04:51.652 --> 01:04:54.382
Oh goody!

01:04:58.559 --> 01:05:02.427
You two get in this one.
Halo and I will take the next one.

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:05.227
Don't be ridiculous.
Ah! What are you doing?

01:05:07.368 --> 01:05:10.337
Who can turn down a free ride?

01:05:14.542 --> 01:05:16.635
Get ready, Halo.

01:05:19.347 --> 01:05:21.645
Jump!

01:05:25.186 --> 01:05:28.815
(laughs)
We've got them now!

01:05:28.856 --> 01:05:32.519
Si. We grab them as soon
as they swing back down.

01:05:36.964 --> 01:05:40.297
Gee, we're up so high no one
can even see us way up here.

01:05:40.334 --> 01:05:42.962
(laughs)
Oh, that's it.

01:05:43.004 --> 01:05:46.337
We can sprout our wings now
without breaking the rules.

01:05:49.944 --> 01:05:51.809
Impossible.

01:05:51.846 --> 01:05:53.871
They're all empty.

01:05:53.915 --> 01:05:56.145
They couldn't just fly away.

01:05:56.184 --> 01:05:58.379
I don't care where they went...

01:05:58.419 --> 01:06:01.911
- (growls)
...but you two are out of here.

01:06:01.956 --> 01:06:06.825
You troublemakers are leaving
this traveling show right now.

01:06:06.861 --> 01:06:08.852
Wait wait, you don't understand.

01:06:08.896 --> 01:06:10.659
Give us one more chance.

01:06:10.698 --> 01:06:14.190
- (both screaming)
- And don't ever come back.

01:06:15.236 --> 01:06:17.170
Arrivederci.

01:06:19.407 --> 01:06:21.500
Mrs. Creepedeep:
Take that, you halfwit.

01:06:33.654 --> 01:06:37.613
Wow, I can't believe
you all came just to rescue me.

01:06:37.658 --> 01:06:39.717
What are heroes for, Littlest?

01:07:01.015 --> 01:07:04.974
Oh, it's good to be back
on solid clouds again.

01:07:05.019 --> 01:07:09.786
So how about showing us what's
so important about that box of yours?

01:07:09.824 --> 01:07:12.884
- Sure thing.
- Ahem.

01:07:12.927 --> 01:07:16.795
I mean, if it's all right
with my headmaster.

01:07:16.831 --> 01:07:20.289
Goodness. Are we sure
we have the right angel?

01:07:20.334 --> 01:07:23.565
I know I haven't acted
much like a real angel...

01:07:23.604 --> 01:07:26.801
just thinking about what
would make me happy

01:07:26.841 --> 01:07:29.810
and not realizing I was putting
all my friends in danger.

01:07:29.844 --> 01:07:31.675
But from now on

01:07:31.712 --> 01:07:35.148
I'm going to be
the best-behaved angel ever.

01:07:35.183 --> 01:07:38.243
So can I, please?

01:07:38.286 --> 01:07:41.312
Uh, "May I?" and all right.

01:07:41.355 --> 01:07:43.789
Then let's see
what we risked our wings for.

01:07:43.824 --> 01:07:45.917
Okay, here goes.

01:07:54.936 --> 01:07:57.370
Aren't they just the greatest?

01:07:58.406 --> 01:08:00.169
- Yes yes.
- They're...

01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:02.540
- real nice. Yeah well.
- Interesting.

01:08:02.577 --> 01:08:04.875
- You don't like them?
- It's not that.

01:08:04.912 --> 01:08:08.348
It's just every great treasure
has a story.

01:08:08.382 --> 01:08:10.407
I guess we need to hear yours.

01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:13.284
Of course,
the legend of the treasure.

01:08:13.321 --> 01:08:14.913
Oh, do tell!

01:08:14.956 --> 01:08:18.483
Well, this is a rock
from the banks of the river

01:08:18.526 --> 01:08:22.292
where I used to swim
and play with all my friends.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:26.426
And once I found this nest
in a tree just outside my window.

01:08:26.466 --> 01:08:30.836
So I got to watch the eggs hatch
and the baby birds grow up and fly off.

01:08:30.871 --> 01:08:33.567
I wonder if they had
as much trouble

01:08:33.608 --> 01:08:35.599
getting used to their wings.

01:08:35.643 --> 01:08:37.804
Anyway, when the nest
was empty,

01:08:37.845 --> 01:08:40.712
I found this beautiful
butterfly inside.

01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:42.841
Its spirit had already gone.

01:08:42.883 --> 01:08:45.716
It's not like l...
well, you know.

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:48.187
- Nay nay, never.
- Heaven forbid.

01:08:48.221 --> 01:08:51.487
And this string was
on my favorite kite and it got loose

01:08:51.524 --> 01:08:55.928
and flew so high, I imagined it must
have gone all the way up to heaven.

01:08:55.962 --> 01:08:59.421
Hmm, remind me to check
the heavenly lost and found

01:08:59.466 --> 01:09:01.560
when we get back
to Celestial City.

01:09:01.602 --> 01:09:05.094
And this belonged to
my first best friend,

01:09:05.139 --> 01:09:07.868
my old dog.

01:09:07.908 --> 01:09:11.537
No doubt about it...
the best treasures I ever saw.

01:09:11.578 --> 01:09:15.174
And now you won't have to be
sad anymore missing earth.

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:17.912
No way.
I have all the best stuff

01:09:17.952 --> 01:09:21.581
right here with me
forever and ever.

01:09:21.622 --> 01:09:26.059
You'll see, Headmaster.
I'm going to make you proud of me.

01:09:30.831 --> 01:09:33.356
(laughing)

01:09:54.422 --> 01:09:59.155
¶ Angels we have
heard on high ¶

01:09:59.193 --> 01:10:03.459
¶ Sweetly singing
o'er the plains ¶

01:10:03.497 --> 01:10:07.490
¶ And the mountains in reply ¶

01:10:07.535 --> 01:10:11.801
¶ Echoing
their joyous strains ¶

01:10:11.839 --> 01:10:15.070
(soloing)
¶ Gloo-ooo ¶

01:10:15.109 --> 01:10:17.839
¶ Ooooo ¶

01:10:17.878 --> 01:10:20.972
¶ Ooooria ¶

01:10:21.015 --> 01:10:25.315
¶ In excelsis deo ¶

01:10:25.353 --> 01:10:28.049
¶ Gloo-ooo ¶

01:10:28.089 --> 01:10:30.250
¶ Ooooo ¶

01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:33.590
¶ Ooooria ¶

01:10:33.627 --> 01:10:38.587
¶ In excelsis deo. ¶

01:11:28.716 --> 01:11:31.685
See? I knew you had
a little angel in you.

01:11:34.688 --> 01:11:36.713
(bell tolling)

01:11:42.863 --> 01:11:44.990
(shouting, laughing)

01:11:46.434 --> 01:11:48.800
We mustn't dally, angels.

01:11:48.836 --> 01:11:52.237
It's nearly time
for the big event.

01:11:52.273 --> 01:11:53.740
What big event?

01:11:53.774 --> 01:11:56.572
A lot's gone on here
since you left, Littlest.

01:11:56.610 --> 01:12:01.604
God is sending his only son Jesus
as a savior for all mankind.

01:12:01.649 --> 01:12:04.379
Hurry hurry, gather up
your gifts for the Lord

01:12:04.418 --> 01:12:06.511
and meet in the Great Hall.

01:12:08.556 --> 01:12:10.183
- Gifts?
- Of course.

01:12:10.224 --> 01:12:12.749
It's Jesus's birthday, after all.

01:12:12.793 --> 01:12:15.387
The very first Christmas.

01:12:15.429 --> 01:12:17.192
Gee, Halo, where am I going to find

01:12:17.231 --> 01:12:19.893
a present nice enough
to give to God's son?

01:12:21.936 --> 01:12:24.268
Come on.
We don't have much time,

01:12:24.305 --> 01:12:28.264
but maybe we can track down
something really special.

01:12:39.753 --> 01:12:41.914
Bystanders: Oh oh.

01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:09.348
It's no use, Halo.
We searched all over heaven

01:13:09.383 --> 01:13:13.752
and I couldn't find anything
nice enough to give God's only son.

01:13:13.787 --> 01:13:16.813
Lucky for us dogs,
we're just born joy-givers.

01:13:16.857 --> 01:13:19.587
So we don't have to come up
with actual presents.

01:13:20.728 --> 01:13:25.290
Wow! Look at all
those priceless treasures.

01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:29.929
That's it, Halo!

01:13:34.675 --> 01:13:38.634
I'm sure God's little boy is gonna
love them just as much as me.

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:45.309
Oh no no no no no.

01:13:45.352 --> 01:13:49.516
What will God think
when he sees that box of old junk?

01:13:49.557 --> 01:13:51.752
- Junk?
- Well, I'm sorry,

01:13:51.792 --> 01:13:54.056
but honesty is the best policy

01:13:54.094 --> 01:13:57.621
- and it's just not suitable for...
- (trumpet blows)

01:13:57.665 --> 01:14:00.259
Oh dear, this is it.

01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:02.701
Every angel, places please.

01:14:11.345 --> 01:14:13.813
Halo, what am I gonna do?

01:14:13.847 --> 01:14:18.375
Alban's right. My box is
just a bunch of old junk.

01:14:18.419 --> 01:14:22.253
I just have to get it back
before God sees it.

01:14:31.565 --> 01:14:33.396
It's now or never.

01:14:45.145 --> 01:14:49.377
God: Littlest Angel,
what are you doing?

01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:51.179
(murmuring)

01:14:53.253 --> 01:14:55.221
Um, l... er,

01:14:55.255 --> 01:14:57.086
made a mistake, Lord.

01:14:57.124 --> 01:14:59.752
I gave a gift, but then

01:14:59.793 --> 01:15:03.524
I realized it's not nearly
a nice enough gift for your son.

01:15:05.232 --> 01:15:08.724
I mean, I know it probably
just looks like old junk

01:15:08.769 --> 01:15:11.397
next to all the magnificent gifts.

01:15:11.438 --> 01:15:14.498
But to me
they're the best treasures ever.

01:15:14.541 --> 01:15:17.635
(sighs)
That poor little guy.

01:15:17.678 --> 01:15:21.478
I warned him. You all heard me.
No one can blame me.

01:15:21.515 --> 01:15:24.313
Uh, can they?

01:15:32.326 --> 01:15:35.090
(onlookers murmuring)

01:15:35.129 --> 01:15:39.065
(gasps) Wow!

01:15:50.644 --> 01:15:53.977
Narrator: The littlest angel
gave the things he cherished most.

01:15:54.248 --> 01:15:57.877
What greater gift
could there ever be?

01:15:57.918 --> 01:16:02.787
This box filled with a child's
pure joy and wonder

01:16:02.823 --> 01:16:06.554
shall forever be a beacon
to light the way...

01:16:09.296 --> 01:16:11.594
known to one and all

01:16:11.632 --> 01:16:14.362
- as the Star of Bethlehem.
- (baby coos)

01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:19.703
- You did it!
- Way to go, little guy.

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:22.106
- I knew you had it in you.
- Sweet little thing.

01:16:23.811 --> 01:16:25.711
Did you see that, Alban?

01:16:25.746 --> 01:16:29.409
Littlest Angel is
our very own shining star.

01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:32.544
Amazing!

01:16:32.586 --> 01:16:35.214
Indeed.
Today the littlest angel proved

01:16:35.255 --> 01:16:37.450
that he's ready to begin traveling

01:16:37.491 --> 01:16:40.619
to earth as a Junior Angel-in-training.

01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:43.721
What? But he hasn't performed
his three good deeds.

01:16:43.764 --> 01:16:46.961
- But he has, indeed.
- I have?

01:16:48.769 --> 01:16:52.466
Good deed number one:
Littlest chose to help the bull

01:16:52.506 --> 01:16:54.906
even after it had
been so mean to him.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.141
Good deed number two:
Littlest risked his own freedom

01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:06.675
to save these two
helpless creatures.

01:17:08.055 --> 01:17:09.818
Too late.

01:17:09.857 --> 01:17:11.518
You grab that kid.

01:17:12.526 --> 01:17:15.086
I guess I see
how those were good deeds.

01:17:15.129 --> 01:17:17.689
But that's only two.
What's the third?

01:17:17.731 --> 01:17:20.825
- Oh oh, I know, I know!
- Yes, Logan?

01:17:20.868 --> 01:17:24.031
When the littlest angel gave away
his beloved treasures

01:17:24.071 --> 01:17:26.437
to bring joy to another child.

01:17:26.473 --> 01:17:28.839
(onlookers exclaiming)

01:17:38.786 --> 01:17:40.617
My wings!

01:17:40.654 --> 01:17:42.622
Your heavenly reward

01:17:42.656 --> 01:17:45.682
for performing
three very good deeds.

01:17:45.726 --> 01:17:48.160
I sure have learned a lot today

01:17:48.195 --> 01:17:52.325
about real friendship
and human kindness

01:17:52.366 --> 01:17:54.766
and forgiveness.

01:17:54.802 --> 01:17:57.430
Yes well, it seems we've all
seen the light today.

01:17:59.173 --> 01:18:02.609
And now it's time for you
to spread God's eternal light,

01:18:02.643 --> 01:18:05.942
helping humanity to feel His love.

01:18:05.979 --> 01:18:08.573
Does that mean
what I think it means?

01:18:08.615 --> 01:18:11.175
Yes, my littlest angel,
from now on

01:18:11.218 --> 01:18:14.619
you will be traveling to earth
to perform more good deeds.

01:18:14.655 --> 01:18:18.716
But of course you will need
an older angel to guide you.

01:18:18.759 --> 01:18:23.059
So, Alban, you have been chosen
to be there to help him

01:18:23.096 --> 01:18:26.190
- every step of the way.
- (groans)

01:18:26.233 --> 01:18:29.725
Me?
Oh, heaven help me.

01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:31.260
(laughter)

01:18:33.974 --> 01:18:36.135
(instrumental music playing)

01:18:49.223 --> 01:18:51.191
(instrumental music playing)

01:18:52.305 --> 01:18:58.183
