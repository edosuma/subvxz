WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:04.833
No, no, no!
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.900 --> 00:07.900
Here's what's
on my mind tonight.

00:10.333 --> 00:12.466
Joe is a down-and-out gambler..

00:12.533 --> 00:14.200
You got the money?

00:14.266 --> 00:16.733
...and a down-and-out
scientist.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.333
Nothing. Always nothing.

00:19.400 --> 00:22.633
Joe is, however,
a first class dreamer.

00:22.700 --> 00:25.566
'It's an intelligent signal.
This is it. It's real.'

00:25.633 --> 00:28.633
But is he willing
to bet his life?

00:28.700 --> 00:30.633
Want a piece of the action?

00:30.700 --> 00:32.666
Find out on the next

00:32.733 --> 00:34.733
"Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.133 --> 00:57.700
You are in Springwood now

00:57.766 --> 00:59.666
and you are all mine.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.566
I'll raise you two grand.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.900
Damn.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.833
I'll up it ten.

01:53.833 --> 01:56.233
You bluffed one time too many.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.233
I see ya.

02:09.333 --> 02:12.200
Uh, come on, play poker.

02:14.933 --> 02:16.900
I am playing poker, Lynch.

02:20.933 --> 02:22.400
Full house.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.100
'Aces. Queens.'

02:28.733 --> 02:31.533
You know I never lose, do ya?

02:31.600 --> 02:33.533
I can't help it if I'm lucky.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.133
I don't think it's luck.

02:39.866 --> 02:42.400
I think you cheat.

02:42.466 --> 02:44.333
Oh, I never cheat, Lynch

02:44.400 --> 02:45.800
except on her.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.866
Afraid we're gonna have to
teach you a lesson, dear boy.

02:52.933 --> 02:55.100
- 'That's right.'
- 'A permanent one.'

03:06.566 --> 03:08.200
Need a hand.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.700
'Hold on. Hold on.
I'm coming.'

03:40.133 --> 03:42.100
You got the money?

03:50.266 --> 03:53.566
What happened
to the big poker game?

03:53.633 --> 03:56.666
You were supposed to win
with your old Mr. Black tonight.

03:56.733 --> 03:58.700
I didn't win as much
as I thought I was.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.700
Oh, you are as bad
at playin' poker

04:01.766 --> 04:03.800
as you are at picking horses.

04:06.566 --> 04:09.966
Thirty thousand dollars
is a lot of money.

04:10.033 --> 04:12.133
Mr. Black's very worried.

04:14.133 --> 04:16.266
And when he is worried

04:16.333 --> 04:18.866
it means I'm not doin' my job.

04:18.933 --> 04:21.166
Barney, I'm gonna
get the money.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.333
- When?
- I got a plan.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.800
Do you mind if I use the phone?

04:28.866 --> 04:30.633
Huh? Yeah, sure.

04:36.033 --> 04:37.766
Hello, Meg, it's me.

04:37.833 --> 04:40.633
I'm gonna be late
for dinner again.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.833
I know I promised.
I'm sorry.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.700
Yeah, sure.
I'll pick some stuff up.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.933
Milk pudding?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.233
Cat food?

04:51.300 --> 04:54.133
Yeah, okay.
I know the good stuff, alright?

04:54.200 --> 04:56.366
Anything else?

04:56.433 --> 04:59.300
Alright.
As soon as I can, honey.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.833
Bye-bye.

05:04.266 --> 05:07.066
It's too bad
I'm late for dinner.

05:07.133 --> 05:10.300
I just stay late.
I enjoy my work.

05:12.033 --> 05:15.933
But remember
this is the last time

05:16.000 --> 05:18.900
that I'm coming by
without doing any damage.

05:18.966 --> 05:20.400
Do you understand?

05:20.466 --> 05:22.866
- Yeah.
- I can't hear you.

05:22.933 --> 05:25.300
- I understand.
- Yeah.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.833
Good.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.333
'Joey!'

05:31.633 --> 05:33.500
That's a good boy.

05:33.566 --> 05:35.533
Tell your brother to wise up.

05:41.666 --> 05:43.833
What is it this time?

05:43.900 --> 05:46.500
Nothin'. Nothin'.
I just owe some money.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.133
I gotta level with you, sis.

05:55.533 --> 05:58.233
Really, that will be
a novel approach.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.966
I'm not kidding.

06:02.033 --> 06:03.666
This time they're gonna kill me.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.500
The stakes have been raised.

06:18.566 --> 06:20.900
I'm willing to bet
Joe can't get by me

06:20.966 --> 06:23.233
without getting slashed.

06:24.833 --> 06:27.200
Want a piece
of the action, hmm?

06:29.466 --> 06:31.900
How much for just the car?

06:31.966 --> 06:34.833
Oh, come on. I can get
a better price from a dealer.

06:37.466 --> 06:39.266
- Good morning, Joe.
- Good morning, Jeannie.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.433
Good morning, Dr. Lynch.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.400
Winston does look
a little like Phil, huh?

06:43.466 --> 06:44.933
I think he's got less hair
in his ears.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.300
Ooh! Ouch!

06:46.366 --> 06:48.300
- How are you doing, boy?
- Oh, he's doing great.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.800
You know, if I say
a single digit number

06:49.866 --> 06:52.100
he can point to a card
with that number on it.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.266
Oh, he is smarter
than Phil too.

06:54.333 --> 06:55.966
Do you have any idea what happ..

06:56.033 --> 06:57.200
Jeannie, what are you
doin' in here?

06:57.266 --> 06:58.533
I need you in the lab.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.733
The computer's keyboard
is locked up again.

07:00.800 --> 07:01.833
Phil, you are a scientist.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.900
Can't you figure out
how to unlock a keyboard?

07:05.166 --> 07:06.566
Uh, in all fairness
to Phil, Joe

07:06.633 --> 07:07.733
it's a mainframe problem.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.400
A lot of the computers
are getting locked.

07:09.466 --> 07:11.300
I see no reason
of being fair to Phil.

07:11.366 --> 07:14.200
You know, if this university
spent more money

07:14.266 --> 07:17.166
on computer maintenance
and less on the useless studies

07:17.233 --> 07:18.666
we'd all be a lot better off.

07:18.733 --> 07:20.966
Oh, and what particular studies
do you have in mind, Phil?

07:21.033 --> 07:23.066
Get real.

07:23.133 --> 07:26.333
Interstellar communication
is not a scientific study.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.733
It's a scam.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.266
- Okay, Phil. Let's go.
- No. Why?

07:29.333 --> 07:32.000
Aren't you curious to see
if Joe's made contact

07:32.066 --> 07:33.233
with extraterrestrial beings?

07:33.300 --> 07:34.400
You're not in communication

07:34.466 --> 07:36.233
with Obi-Wan Kenobi,
are you, Joe?

07:36.300 --> 07:37.500
You know, Phil,
your problem is

07:37.566 --> 07:39.300
that you're having trouble
with my deciphering program.

07:39.366 --> 07:40.833
It's beyond your comprehension.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.566
Your deciphering program
is less complex

07:43.633 --> 07:45.633
'than my son's Atari system.'

07:45.700 --> 07:47.600
If that's true,
why is the Jet Repulsion Lab

07:47.666 --> 07:49.166
giving Joe a grant
to decipher signals

07:49.233 --> 07:50.166
from the Voyager's space pro--

07:50.233 --> 07:51.333
No, no, no, no.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.866
The grant is to listen
to extraneous noise

07:53.933 --> 07:55.933
from the Voyager
and it's cheaper to farm it out

07:56.000 --> 07:58.933
to a small-time loser than
waste the man-hours themselves.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.400
- Oh, now, why would they even--
- Jeannie!

08:03.733 --> 08:06.166
It's useless. Forget it.

08:06.233 --> 08:09.300
You know, the man gets one grant
in five years

08:09.366 --> 08:12.100
and it's to study
extraneous noise.

08:12.166 --> 08:15.866
Oh, oh, I'm sorry if I have
touched on a sore spot, Joe.

08:15.933 --> 08:19.233
I don't know. I just seem
to rack up grant after grant.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.933
But you know, that's the way
the world works, Joe.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.500
The purpose of a grant
is to fund useful study.

08:25.566 --> 08:26.600
Okay, that's enough.
Let's go.

08:26.666 --> 08:28.400
Hey, I'm going.

09:00.766 --> 09:02.933
Another space storm.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.166
Nothing.

09:05.233 --> 09:06.800
Always nothing.

09:41.033 --> 09:42.966
Oh, my God.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.400
'What's going on?'

10:00.500 --> 10:01.933
Where are you?

10:06.033 --> 10:07.633
What's going on?

10:24.400 --> 10:26.600
Jeannie.
What are you doing here?

10:26.666 --> 10:29.000
I just wanted to see
if you wanted a cup of coffee.

10:29.700 --> 10:30.633
Oh!

10:35.666 --> 10:37.633
No word from space yet, huh?

10:45.600 --> 10:47.200
- Jeannie, hi.
- Millie, hi.

10:47.266 --> 10:49.800
You must be really excited
about Joe's deal.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.500
Joe's deal?

10:52.133 --> 10:53.533
Which deal is that?

10:53.600 --> 10:56.000
You don't know?
The insider stock deal?

10:56.066 --> 10:57.733
Joe is gonna be rich.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.400
- Did you invest?
- Oh, I only wish I could.

11:00.466 --> 11:02.433
Unfortunately I don't have
any extra money.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.233
Well, better luck next time.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.533
Yeah. Bye, Millie.
Good luck, Joe.

11:09.466 --> 11:11.566
How could you steal
that poor girl's savings?

11:11.633 --> 11:12.933
It's not stealing, sis.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.033
I-I was gonna pay her
back double.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.633
Sure.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.733
You and your monkey dreams.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.733
Monkey dreams?
What's that?

11:21.800 --> 11:25.666
That bedtime story
that mom used to tell us.

11:25.733 --> 11:29.033
You know, the, the one
where the monkey had everything

11:29.100 --> 11:31.266
but he still wanted to be king.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.133
And he lost everything he had.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.866
Yeah.

11:34.933 --> 11:36.433
Well, whenever you or dad

11:36.500 --> 11:39.333
would come up
with one of your schemes..

11:39.400 --> 11:44.066
...she'd just point at you guys
and say monkey dreams.

11:44.133 --> 11:46.700
Oh, I am glad you and mom
shared so much.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.933
Why can't you just
accept things?

11:54.666 --> 11:55.900
Joey.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.300
'I've got something to say.'

12:01.200 --> 12:03.033
I can't keep falling
for your schemes

12:03.100 --> 12:04.300
and giving you money.

12:04.366 --> 12:05.666
Well, they'll be killing me soon

12:05.733 --> 12:06.866
and that will take
the pressure off.

12:06.933 --> 12:09.000
Joey, please.

12:09.066 --> 12:10.266
Try to understand.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.533
I've never had a life of my own.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.033
I've always had you and
your problems holding me back.

12:16.100 --> 12:17.666
Well, I have a life of my own

12:17.733 --> 12:20.100
and, uh, take it from me,
it's overrated.

12:22.433 --> 12:25.500
Joey, what I am trying
to tell you

12:25.566 --> 12:27.533
is that I'm through.

12:28.333 --> 12:30.000
No more big plans.

12:30.066 --> 12:31.533
No more money.

12:33.566 --> 12:35.600
And no more you.

12:35.666 --> 12:38.066
Don't say that, sis.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.833
I can change.

12:39.900 --> 12:40.933
You know,
I've been thinking about it.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.633
That, that, you know,
all my big plans

12:42.700 --> 12:44.533
they lead to nothing.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.200
And, uh, I could settle down

12:46.266 --> 12:48.233
and, and accept my life.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.833
If you're gonna change..

12:51.900 --> 12:54.100
...it has to be
because you want to.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.700
And, Joey..

12:58.766 --> 13:00.400
...I love you.

13:02.266 --> 13:04.200
But now you're on your own

13:16.500 --> 13:17.700
Bye.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.366
Wait. Millie.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.300
Millie, Millie.
I'm getting something.

13:26.366 --> 13:28.300
I'm getting something.

13:30.933 --> 13:33.400
It's an intelligence, see?

13:33.466 --> 13:35.400
This is it! It's real!

13:36.666 --> 13:38.833
This is it. It's real!
It's real.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.900
This it it. The big one!

13:40.966 --> 13:43.100
I'm gonna get that grant!

13:52.233 --> 13:53.533
'It-it makes no sense.'

13:53.600 --> 13:55.933
'First, first there's
just a clear pattern'

13:56.000 --> 13:58.133
'of repeating N-T-O
over and over again.'

13:58.200 --> 14:00.266
'And then
it's just random signals.'

14:00.333 --> 14:02.533
- Oh, maybe.
- Maybe?

14:02.600 --> 14:03.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you see

14:03.600 --> 14:04.866
we can only think
in terms of ourselves.

14:04.933 --> 14:07.800
Maybe the recognizable patterns
are like call letters.

14:07.866 --> 14:09.666
Their ideas of a signal
that's only understood

14:09.733 --> 14:12.166
by any intelligence.

14:12.233 --> 14:14.866
Like-like a calling all ships
code or-or an SOS.

14:14.933 --> 14:16.333
Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.100
And the rest is a language
with a code

14:18.166 --> 14:20.800
that's so sophisticated,
it appears, uh

14:20.866 --> 14:22.866
random to the rest of us.

14:22.933 --> 14:25.266
Oh, it's gonna be
difficult to crack.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.600
Hey, if anybody can do it,
you can.

14:28.666 --> 14:31.266
Millie, I'm gonna
need help on this one.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.200
You're the only one I know
with enough computer skills

14:33.266 --> 14:35.266
to monitor the signal..

14:35.333 --> 14:37.300
...and to keep it quiet.

14:37.366 --> 14:39.766
Okay. I'll try to take
some time off.

14:39.833 --> 14:40.800
That's my girl.

14:40.866 --> 14:43.500
Eh, easy, buster,
I'm not quitting my job.

14:43.566 --> 14:46.400
I'm just gonna take
a couple days off.

14:46.466 --> 14:48.633
- Best sister in the world.
- Yeah.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.200
Oh, God, you know, I think
the key to the hidden code

14:51.266 --> 14:53.233
is in the signals.

14:55.066 --> 14:57.566
Hey, what about that guy
who wants his money?

14:57.633 --> 14:59.600
Have you done anything
about that?

15:01.133 --> 15:03.300
Oh, I forgot about him.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.900
What's wrong with me?
I've got nothing to worry about.

15:21.733 --> 15:22.700
Millie?

15:22.766 --> 15:24.500
'Help, Joey!'

15:24.566 --> 15:25.700
'Help!'

15:25.766 --> 15:27.866
- Millie!
- Help!

15:27.933 --> 15:30.200
- Stay back!
- What do you want with her?

15:35.800 --> 15:37.166
No!

15:53.733 --> 15:55.633
'Where the hell are you going?'

15:55.700 --> 15:56.933
To the bathroom.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.633
Unless you think
leaving me alone that long

15:58.700 --> 16:00.866
is a security risk.

16:00.933 --> 16:02.700
Sorry, sis.

16:13.866 --> 16:16.133
Okay, where is the money?

16:16.200 --> 16:18.366
Barney, I swear
I got something big going.

16:18.433 --> 16:20.400
I'll have it
three days tops.

16:22.100 --> 16:23.600
Twenty four hours?

16:26.900 --> 16:29.300
Do you promise me..

16:29.366 --> 16:30.833
...that you have the money

16:30.900 --> 16:32.200
Yeah.

16:35.633 --> 16:37.033
Okay.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.333
But I believe
in keeping my promises.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.733
The last time I'd seen ya

16:44.800 --> 16:46.700
I promised
I'd hurt you this time.

16:46.766 --> 16:48.600
Oh! Please.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.200
Ah!

16:50.266 --> 16:51.266
Stop.

17:05.133 --> 17:06.500
Breakfast.

17:06.566 --> 17:08.700
I got another transmission
last night.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.233
We have another letter
in the sequence.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.733
I'm convinced that the random
processing of call letters

17:12.800 --> 17:15.266
isn't important,
but the sequence, it matters.

17:15.333 --> 17:19.300
Hey, I called Jack Cantrell,
a friend of mine from college.

17:19.366 --> 17:21.500
He's working in a private
sector, heavily funded.

17:21.566 --> 17:22.733
He told me
that if I crack the code

17:22.800 --> 17:24.166
I can get a six-figure grant.

17:24.233 --> 17:26.333
And if I can fax him
the results immediately

17:26.400 --> 17:28.800
I'll get $30,000 tomorrow.

17:28.866 --> 17:30.233
That's incredible.

17:32.066 --> 17:33.966
Well, so I got things handled.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.100
Why don't you go back to work?

17:35.166 --> 17:37.100
I don't want you
to lose your job.

17:39.733 --> 17:41.500
Wait a second.

17:41.566 --> 17:43.033
You're not telling me somethin'.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.066
What makes you say that?

17:45.400 --> 17:48.200
You have never been concerned
with my well-being.

17:48.266 --> 17:50.733
So when you tell me that you're
worried I might lose my job

17:50.800 --> 17:52.200
I know you're lying.

17:52.266 --> 17:55.166
You're afraid that creep will be
back before you break the code.

17:55.233 --> 17:56.566
What did the doctor say
about your hand?

17:56.633 --> 17:58.700
It will be alright.
I can handle it.

18:00.333 --> 18:03.066
Why don't you call the police?
I'll do it.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.100
No. You're gonna get me killed.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.233
Sis, we'll do it my way.

18:10.666 --> 18:12.600
I just wanna help.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.900
You'll make it harder for me.

18:15.966 --> 18:17.333
Please?

18:21.033 --> 18:22.433
Alright.

18:45.366 --> 18:47.633
Barney, old buddy.

18:47.700 --> 18:49.733
Have a seat.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.033
- You're nuts, kid.
- Am I?

18:53.133 --> 18:55.600
I've been waiting
my whole life for this.

18:55.666 --> 18:57.000
You see my problem is

18:57.066 --> 18:58.866
I was born
in the wrong century.

18:58.933 --> 19:00.666
I'm a Riverboat Gambler.

19:00.733 --> 19:02.700
You're a born loser

19:02.766 --> 19:04.633
and you're gonna die that way.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.700
Youar

19:06.766 --> 19:09.766
You see, this time
I'm gonna win the big hand.

19:09.833 --> 19:11.266
The jackpot.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.566
And I just love it that you're
gonna give me some trouble

19:13.633 --> 19:15.733
so that I could kill you
in the process.

19:22.533 --> 19:24.566
See, another letter.

19:24.633 --> 19:27.433
You're like cards
being turned over in a hand.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.800
Oh, hi.

19:32.066 --> 19:33.466
Jeannie, I'm busy.
Come back later.

19:33.533 --> 19:35.066
- Well, but I--
- 'I said later!'

19:35.133 --> 19:37.200
Sure.

19:37.266 --> 19:39.033
It's a pity.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.466
She isn't on my lap.

19:40.533 --> 19:42.500
That would make
the scenario complete.

19:44.033 --> 19:45.000
Listen.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.233
Mashoo, what are you doing out?
Come here, you.

19:57.300 --> 19:58.633
Come here, come here.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.133
So what're you doin' out, huh?

20:00.200 --> 20:02.000
Did my Winston let you
out again, huh?

20:02.066 --> 20:04.700
Did he, uh, did he let you out?

20:04.766 --> 20:06.266
Go in,
go in the house for me.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.633
Come on, in the house.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.733
There you go.
Good boy, Mashoo.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.300
You're my boy.
Yes, you are.

20:24.733 --> 20:25.900
What?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.100
How?

20:35.800 --> 20:37.666
Winston!

20:37.733 --> 20:40.633
She didn't know
how to open these cages.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.100
Come on, you know
you're only supposed to play

20:42.166 --> 20:43.733
with this when I'm here.

20:50.100 --> 20:52.266
You typed your name.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.633
You are so smart.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.800
Yes, you are.
You are so smart.

21:09.100 --> 21:10.933
- How you doin'?
- Better.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.200
A whole lot better.
I'm going into work next week.

21:14.266 --> 21:16.433
Easy, tiger.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.066
And what's the rush

21:18.133 --> 21:21.666
now that your aliens
turned out to be a chimp?

21:21.733 --> 21:24.300
Oh, I'll be hearing that one
for the rest of my life.

21:24.366 --> 21:28.166
But, sis, good things come
when we least expect them.

21:28.233 --> 21:29.833
What are you talking about?

21:29.900 --> 21:31.833
Oh, Jeannie and Lynch
came by today.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.266
My language conversion program

21:33.333 --> 21:35.866
is perfect for communicating
with primates.

21:35.933 --> 21:38.200
And we're gonna do
the work in Africa.

21:38.266 --> 21:40.300
Oh, good for you,
little brother.

21:41.733 --> 21:43.566
And..

21:43.633 --> 21:45.600
...I've gotten my hands..

21:47.000 --> 21:48.933
...on a treasure map.

21:52.233 --> 21:54.400
There's this little place
in Tanzania

21:54.466 --> 21:57.066
where rumrunners have
hidden a fortune.

21:57.133 --> 21:58.533
We're gonna be rich.

22:02.133 --> 22:04.566
There's just one thing.

22:04.633 --> 22:07.366
Oh, I'll just bet there is.

22:07.433 --> 22:08.733
What is it?

22:12.766 --> 22:15.233
There's no time.

22:24.133 --> 22:26.800
Wait, kitties,
our little story here

22:26.866 --> 22:28.066
has a happy ending.

22:28.133 --> 22:30.300
Joe got a grant
to see how fast the worms

22:30.366 --> 22:31.533
could eat through his body.

22:32.900 --> 22:34.833
I'd smart myself up.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.666
'But how can you do this?'

22:41.733 --> 22:45.033
Winston and I are so close
to a breakthrough.

22:45.100 --> 22:47.900
You're not talking science,
you're talking dreams.

22:47.966 --> 22:49.700
And dreams don't pay the rent,
grants do.

22:49.766 --> 22:52.400
There is more to Winston
than you think, much more.

22:52.466 --> 22:55.266
Jeannie, I would love
to let you continue

22:55.333 --> 22:57.466
with Winston. I really would.

22:57.533 --> 23:00.266
'But the money for that research
is exhausted.'

23:00.333 --> 23:01.333
Yes, but if you--

23:01.400 --> 23:03.666
The name of the game is grants.

23:03.733 --> 23:05.900
Now whether we like it or not,
they dictate what we do

23:05.966 --> 23:08.200
and right now they're payin' us
to do cancer research.

23:08.266 --> 23:10.400
Could-co-co..
Will you just do it?

23:12.433 --> 23:13.933
Sorry, Phil.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.766
You're right.

23:15.833 --> 23:17.133
Good girl.

23:20.566 --> 23:23.066
Okay, I want you to get up
to speed on these experiments.

23:23.133 --> 23:25.000
You can start
by studying the data

23:25.066 --> 23:26.333
on the first two pain levels.

23:26.400 --> 23:27.666
- Pain levels?
- Yes.

23:27.733 --> 23:29.866
A cancer patient
experiences pain

23:29.933 --> 23:32.400
which could be described
on an ascending curve

23:32.466 --> 23:36.333
which I've divided
into five levels of intensity.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.833
And what we're studying
is the impact--

23:37.900 --> 23:39.533
Wait, wait, wait a second!

23:39.600 --> 23:41.100
Are you saying..

23:41.166 --> 23:43.100
God, you're not inflicting pain
on Winston.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.300
Jeannie, we've been
all through--

23:45.366 --> 23:46.333
Wait, I can't believe
anything good

23:46.400 --> 23:47.533
could come out of hurting him.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.000
Jeannie, do you have any idea

23:49.066 --> 23:50.233
of the amount of pain

23:50.300 --> 23:52.833
a terminal cancer patient
experiences?

23:52.900 --> 23:54.566
But Winston is a being too.

23:54.633 --> 23:57.233
He has feelings
and thoughts and--

23:57.300 --> 23:59.600
- He's just a monkey.
- No, he's not ju..

23:59.666 --> 24:02.400
- Excuse me.
- Uh..

24:02.466 --> 24:03.466
Y-yes, what is it?

24:03.533 --> 24:05.266
Uh, I'm Bob Catlin.

24:05.333 --> 24:07.533
I'm coming
from "Science Discoveries."

24:07.600 --> 24:09.833
Oh, hi, we spoke on the phone.

24:09.900 --> 24:11.900
This is Dr. Lynch.

24:11.966 --> 24:14.466
Uh, Jeannie, what is this?

24:14.533 --> 24:17.300
I told you.
Bob is going to interview you?

24:17.366 --> 24:18.666
I don't remember that.

24:18.733 --> 24:21.133
I love it,
the absent-minded professor.

24:23.466 --> 24:25.666
What did you say the name
of your publication is?

24:25.733 --> 24:27.166
"Science Discoveries."

24:27.233 --> 24:28.633
Well, we're doin'
a series of articles

24:28.700 --> 24:31.733
following a medical discovery
from its beginnings in the lab

24:31.800 --> 24:34.133
until it reaches the patient.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.933
I'm not familiar
with your publication.

24:37.000 --> 24:37.933
Well, we're new, but--

24:38.000 --> 24:39.466
Hey, what-what are you doing?

24:39.533 --> 24:40.866
Well, it is a photo article.

24:40.933 --> 24:42.666
- Listen, out!
- But, Dr. Lynch.

24:42.733 --> 24:44.700
I want you both
out of my lab right now.

24:46.366 --> 24:48.833
I'll call you, uh..

24:48.900 --> 24:50.833
Maybe you're right,
this is a bad time.

24:53.933 --> 24:56.600
What is the matter with you?
Why did you kick them out?

24:56.666 --> 24:58.733
What's the matter with me?
You, uh, they..

25:00.500 --> 25:02.700
I didn't believe
a word he said.

25:02.766 --> 25:05.966
For all we know he's with some
animal liberation group.

25:06.033 --> 25:07.733
Boy, talk about paranoid.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.900
Uh, well,
we can't be too careful.

25:10.966 --> 25:13.233
Uh, they-they could try
to steal the animals.

25:15.166 --> 25:17.700
It wouldn't be such a bad idea.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.700
I don't need to experiment

25:19.766 --> 25:21.533
on no dumb animals.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.733
I've been having such
good results with, uh..

25:23.800 --> 25:26.600
...people.

26:28.033 --> 26:30.233
Help me!

26:30.300 --> 26:34.866
You're not gonna profit
from that chimp's agony anymore.

26:34.933 --> 26:37.533
Help me!

26:58.000 --> 26:59.600
'It's okay.'

27:07.966 --> 27:09.666
- Huh.
- Hmm?

27:09.733 --> 27:12.100
There's no increase
in respiration at all.

27:12.166 --> 27:15.033
Make a note to increase
the stress level..

27:15.100 --> 27:16.633
...uh, 20%.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.033
Okay.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.800
Are you still sleeping her
at the lab?

27:31.866 --> 27:33.833
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

27:33.900 --> 27:36.233
It's been a long time since
you separated from your wife.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.766
I know.

27:37.833 --> 27:41.566
I suppose I haven't really had
enough time to find a new place.

27:41.633 --> 27:44.033
That's not really true.
I just don't like being alone.

27:44.100 --> 27:46.133
At least here at the lab,
you can..

27:46.200 --> 27:48.166
...hear the animals.

27:48.233 --> 27:51.566
And I suppose with this, uh,
alleged reporter snooping around

27:51.633 --> 27:54.633
it's probably best
that I'm here.

27:54.700 --> 27:57.333
Something happened?
Did they come back?

27:57.400 --> 27:59.166
No, not so far.

27:59.233 --> 28:01.866
So why are you so convinced
they're animal rights people?

28:01.933 --> 28:04.366
Jeannie, I know
I must seem paranoid.

28:04.433 --> 28:07.566
But please, indulge me,
don't talk to anybody

28:07.633 --> 28:10.033
until I've had a chance
to check, okay?

28:10.100 --> 28:13.100
- I promise.
- 'Thank you.'

28:17.900 --> 28:21.166
Well, if we're gonna get
some work done on level three

28:21.233 --> 28:23.400
we'd best get started.

28:23.466 --> 28:26.933
Do bring, uh, Winston
to the table.

28:34.633 --> 28:36.000
Come on, boy.

28:39.266 --> 28:40.733
It's okay.

28:45.266 --> 28:46.533
Here you go.

29:26.133 --> 29:28.766
Hi. Not even a hi back?

29:28.833 --> 29:30.366
What do you want?

29:30.433 --> 29:31.900
I was planning to use
my boyish charm

29:31.966 --> 29:35.066
to help convince you
to let me interview Dr. Lynch.

29:35.133 --> 29:37.333
I can't help you.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.733
I've decided not to
go back to the lab.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.600
Why not?

29:41.666 --> 29:44.333
I don't think I should be
talking to you about this.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.400
Alright, I won't
press you on it.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.533
We have this chimp..

29:56.600 --> 29:58.100
...Winston.

29:59.866 --> 30:02.133
And we're doing
experiments that..

30:03.833 --> 30:06.100
...hurt him.

30:06.166 --> 30:07.433
I see.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.166
And you don't want
any part of it.

30:09.233 --> 30:11.066
No.

30:11.133 --> 30:13.000
Would you think that's enough?

30:13.066 --> 30:14.466
What's enough?

30:14.533 --> 30:16.133
Not having any part of it.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.000
I mean, shouldn't you also
be trying to stop it?

30:19.066 --> 30:21.833
He's right, isn't he?

30:21.900 --> 30:23.833
You arean animal
rights activist.

30:29.133 --> 30:31.600
You have to do something.

30:31.666 --> 30:32.833
Like what?

30:32.900 --> 30:34.833
Just give me the key to his lab.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.300
I will not.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.500
I don't like what he's doing

30:44.566 --> 30:47.166
but I don't like what
you people do either.

30:47.233 --> 30:49.700
You're stopping experiments
that are important.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.266
Are you sure?

30:53.333 --> 30:54.766
You really think
science can't advance

30:54.833 --> 30:56.433
without torturing animals?

31:02.333 --> 31:03.733
Hello.

31:03.800 --> 31:05.733
Bill, yeah,
what'd you find out?

31:07.800 --> 31:09.833
No such magazine exists.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.933
I knew it. I knew. W..

31:12.000 --> 31:14.466
What about Catlin?

31:14.533 --> 31:16.700
Really?

31:16.766 --> 31:19.266
All for break-ins?

31:19.333 --> 31:21.233
Wha..
If he was arrested three times

31:21.300 --> 31:24.000
how come there were
no convictions?

31:24.066 --> 31:27.800
That's ridiculous, there are
never any eye witnesses. He..

31:27.866 --> 31:30.466
Okay, right.

31:30.533 --> 31:32.000
You got the pictures?

31:32.066 --> 31:33.666
Can you fax them to me?

31:33.733 --> 31:34.966
Right away. That's beautiful.

31:35.033 --> 31:36.200
Okay, well, thanks a lot, Bill.

31:36.266 --> 31:38.066
You've been real helpful.

31:38.133 --> 31:39.433
Bye.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.033
Phil!

32:19.433 --> 32:21.733
What are you doing here?

32:21.800 --> 32:25.200
Uh, well, I-I just thought
I'd drop by to

32:25.266 --> 32:28.500
uh, see if I could
talk you into coming back.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.866
Oh, um, not too receptive
to that idea, huh?

32:35.933 --> 32:37.400
Where's the sugar?

32:38.666 --> 32:41.133
'Oh, I didn't know
you had company.'

32:41.200 --> 32:43.633
'Dr. Lynch.'

32:43.700 --> 32:45.300
You promised.

32:45.366 --> 32:46.566
You..

32:46.633 --> 32:48.700
You weren't supposed
to talk to them..

32:48.766 --> 32:51.766
Well, so that's why
you're not coming back. Ha!

32:51.833 --> 32:53.300
No, Phil, wait!

32:56.666 --> 32:58.600
There you go.

33:38.933 --> 33:41.100
What are you doing here
this time of the night?

33:42.233 --> 33:44.633
I couldn't sleep.

33:44.700 --> 33:47.533
I couldn't stop thinking
about how foolish I've been.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.000
Mmm.

33:59.366 --> 34:01.233
Oh, Jeannie.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.133
I've dreamed of this.

34:09.500 --> 34:12.300
You're always so proper
in the lab and in class.

34:13.566 --> 34:15.833
But I always suspected you had

34:15.900 --> 34:18.500
deep desires underneath.

34:18.566 --> 34:20.100
I do.

34:21.733 --> 34:22.933
Mmm.

34:25.933 --> 34:27.700
Yes.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.433
Deep desires.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.166
Animal desires.

34:33.233 --> 34:35.066
Oh, yes.

34:36.766 --> 34:38.666
Oh, baby.

34:38.733 --> 34:40.200
Did the scratches hurt?

34:40.266 --> 34:42.666
That's too bad

34:42.733 --> 34:44.733
'cause it's only level one

34:57.866 --> 34:59.966
I don't like you.

35:00.033 --> 35:02.833
Jeannie...why?

35:02.900 --> 35:07.166
Because I'm one of them now.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.233
If I didn't come in on 'em
when I did

36:08.300 --> 36:10.500
they probably would've
gotten the animals.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.400
Can you describe them?

36:13.466 --> 36:15.466
Describe them?

36:15.533 --> 36:18.033
I could do better than that.

36:18.100 --> 36:20.800
I can give pictures.

36:20.866 --> 36:22.133
Pictures.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.266
Well, I heard
about the break-in

36:24.333 --> 36:26.500
and I wanted to say
how sorry I am

36:26.566 --> 36:28.133
and to assure you
I had nothing to do with it.

36:28.200 --> 36:30.666
Oh, of course, you didn't.
I know that.

36:30.733 --> 36:33.133
The guy was pretty crazy
the other night.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.666
Well, have they caught them?

36:34.733 --> 36:37.033
No, not so far.

36:37.100 --> 36:39.233
I am so sorry
I talked to them, Phil.

36:39.300 --> 36:40.700
I know how much it upset you.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.766
- Oh, that's alright.
- Is it?

36:42.833 --> 36:45.700
Your dream about me
was so filled with hate.

36:45.766 --> 36:47.300
I don't know, was it about you

36:47.366 --> 36:49.766
or was it about these
animal rights people?

36:49.833 --> 36:52.600
Maybe it's about neither.

36:52.666 --> 36:53.900
What do you mean?

36:53.966 --> 36:55.900
In each of your dreams,
you're a victim.

36:55.966 --> 36:57.966
Maybe you're starting
to identify with the animals.

36:58.033 --> 37:02.100
- With Winston.
- Identify with the animal!

37:02.166 --> 37:03.800
Jeannie, that's really reaching.

37:03.866 --> 37:05.700
Yeah, maybe.

37:05.766 --> 37:07.800
Look, if the dream had to do
with anything at all

37:07.866 --> 37:10.566
it was about these
animal rights hoodlums.

37:10.633 --> 37:13.433
I'll probably keep having them
as long as they're on the loose.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.400
Phil, I wanna come back.

37:18.466 --> 37:20.833
- Really?
- I've been wrong.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.900
Instead of quitting,
I should've spent my spare time

37:22.966 --> 37:25.200
working on Winston's
intelligence studies.

37:25.266 --> 37:28.133
I know he and I can convince you
that he's more than you think.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.566
Well, I wouldn't
get my hopes up

37:30.633 --> 37:32.600
but you're certainly
welcome back.

37:34.533 --> 37:37.033
Winston, I missed you.

37:37.100 --> 37:39.100
Yes, I did. How are you?

37:39.166 --> 37:41.100
How's my boy, huh?

37:42.400 --> 37:44.000
'Maybe you're not coming up
with answers'

37:44.066 --> 37:46.033
'because I'm not asking
the right questions.'

37:47.666 --> 37:50.133
'If you could just communicate
something to me'

37:50.200 --> 37:52.500
'I could stop the pain.'

37:52.566 --> 37:54.566
'Oh, Winston.'

37:54.633 --> 37:56.033
'Oh, please, Winston.'

37:57.600 --> 38:00.300
'Our only hope
is if Phil sees the truth.'

38:21.400 --> 38:23.200
Well, doc..

38:23.266 --> 38:25.333
...it's time for level five.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.833
'Does that scare you, doc?'

38:29.866 --> 38:31.666
'How come?'

38:31.733 --> 38:33.700
Can't take a little pain?

38:37.833 --> 38:39.866
Or maybe that's because

38:39.933 --> 38:42.366
we both know that level five

38:42.433 --> 38:44.600
always ends in death.

38:56.666 --> 38:59.000
Why don't they stop?

38:59.066 --> 39:01.566
Can't they hear
what I'm saying?

39:01.633 --> 39:02.633
Stop!

39:03.966 --> 39:05.366
St..

39:05.433 --> 39:06.733
Stop!

39:17.966 --> 39:19.233
Hello?

39:19.300 --> 39:20.800
'Uh, yes,
this is Officer Barton.'

39:20.866 --> 39:22.500
'Can I speak with Dr. Lynch?'

39:22.566 --> 39:24.200
This is Dr. Lynch.

39:24.266 --> 39:26.066
'I just wanted to let you know'

39:26.133 --> 39:28.566
'that Catlin and Deerfield
have been caught.'

39:28.633 --> 39:30.166
They have?

39:30.233 --> 39:31.800
Oh, good.

39:31.866 --> 39:33.766
There you go, Winston.

39:33.833 --> 39:36.000
Do you have something
you wanna tell me?

39:36.066 --> 39:37.500
Huh, Winston?

39:40.300 --> 39:42.800
Tomorrow we go into level five.

39:42.866 --> 39:44.300
Last chance, kiddo.

39:46.333 --> 39:47.333
Hmm?

39:48.400 --> 39:50.533
Nighty night.

40:30.900 --> 40:34.400
Hello there, Winston.
How are you this evening?

40:34.466 --> 40:35.833
Hmm?

40:42.200 --> 40:44.900
Oh, Jeannie is so childish
with you.

40:44.966 --> 40:47.866
Silly fantasies
that you have human traits.

40:47.933 --> 40:49.633
Come now.

40:52.333 --> 40:54.700
Come on, boy,
let's go over to the table.

41:00.533 --> 41:02.866
Now then Jeannie lives

41:02.933 --> 41:05.433
in a child world

41:05.500 --> 41:07.933
but you and I live
in an adult world, right?

41:08.000 --> 41:10.633
'Friend, friend.'

41:10.700 --> 41:12.100
'Friend.'

41:13.933 --> 41:16.433
'F-f-f..'

41:16.500 --> 41:17.733
Winston?

41:19.166 --> 41:20.733
Did you say..

41:20.800 --> 41:22.433
'Friend.'

41:22.500 --> 41:23.900
...friend?

41:26.300 --> 41:27.800
Oh, my God, you said it.

41:27.866 --> 41:29.833
I heard you. You..

41:35.966 --> 41:38.200
What have I been doing to you?

41:40.733 --> 41:42.700
Oh, Winston..

41:44.733 --> 41:46.700
Jeannie was right.

41:47.466 --> 41:49.433
You should be free.

42:00.466 --> 42:03.100
- Good morning, Phil.
- Well, good morning, Jeannie.

42:03.166 --> 42:05.900
Oh, you look, uh, different.

42:05.966 --> 42:09.066
I feel different.
Whole new man!

42:09.133 --> 42:11.400
- Did it happen?
- Did what happen?

42:11.466 --> 42:13.966
You know, a dream about Winston.

42:14.033 --> 42:15.133
- Oh!
- About how you..

42:16.800 --> 42:18.300
What's so funny?

42:18.366 --> 42:20.133
Well, actually the reason
why I feel better

42:20.200 --> 42:22.566
is because I didn't have
the dream about Winston

42:22.633 --> 42:24.633
for the first time
in a while, really.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.233
- Oh!
- Now see.

42:26.300 --> 42:28.300
I told you
the dreams will probably stop

42:28.366 --> 42:32.366
as soon as I got those
activist people behind bars.

42:32.433 --> 42:34.666
And your feelings
haven't changed?

42:34.733 --> 42:36.666
You're still gonna
experiment on Winston.

42:36.733 --> 42:38.800
Of course,
that's what we do here.

42:43.766 --> 42:45.700
Then let me have Winston.

42:46.866 --> 42:48.833
Please, Phil.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.200
For me.

42:52.300 --> 42:53.766
No.

42:53.833 --> 42:57.566
Uh, because it-it wouldn't
be the end of it.

42:57.633 --> 43:00.566
There'd be another chimp,
then you wanna set him free

43:00.633 --> 43:01.666
and then there'll be..
You know--

43:01.733 --> 43:04.000
I guess there's just
nothing I can..

43:04.066 --> 43:05.966
"Level five until end."

43:06.033 --> 43:07.833
What does that mean?

43:07.900 --> 43:09.300
Oh, no.

43:11.966 --> 43:13.766
'You are gonna kill him,
aren't you?'

43:13.833 --> 43:15.033
'You're gonna torture him
to death.'

43:15.100 --> 43:16.266
Oh, Jeannie,
get control of yourself.

43:16.333 --> 43:18.300
I can't believe
how blind I've been!

43:20.233 --> 43:22.433
You are not gonna
get away with it.

43:23.766 --> 43:25.766
I'll stop you..

43:25.833 --> 43:27.866
...even if I have to get him
out of here myself.

43:27.933 --> 43:31.400
No, no, alright, see
I thought this might happen.

43:31.466 --> 43:34.066
I'm really
so disappointed in you.

43:34.133 --> 43:37.266
I really expected
great things from you, Jeannie.

43:37.333 --> 43:38.600
- Oh!
- No.

43:38.666 --> 43:40.433
I can't let you go
in there, Jeannie.

43:40.500 --> 43:41.666
What are you doing?

43:44.333 --> 43:47.466
Okay, I want you to remove her
from the premises.

43:47.533 --> 43:49.800
Phil, come on. Phil--

43:49.866 --> 43:51.766
'Don't let her within 100 yards
of this building.'

43:51.833 --> 43:53.333
Let go of me, I'm warning you.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.700
Phil, please
let me have Winston!

43:55.766 --> 43:57.333
Let him go free!

43:57.400 --> 43:59.633
Free? Free!

43:59.700 --> 44:02.833
This research isi

44:02.900 --> 44:06.333
With the exception of you
and a handful of moron activist

44:06.400 --> 44:09.800
no one would dream
of letting him go free!

44:09.866 --> 44:12.700
No one would dream
of letting him go free!

44:24.100 --> 44:26.033
You should be free.

44:30.033 --> 44:32.000
You should be free.

44:34.533 --> 44:35.833
Friend.

44:38.733 --> 44:39.700
Friend.

44:39.766 --> 44:42.166
Everybody dreams.

44:42.233 --> 44:45.033
Everybody dreams.

44:45.933 --> 44:47.633
Think about it.
