WEBVTT

00:06.506 --> 00:07.774
Hello, pussycat.

00:07.774 --> 00:09.075
Oh, really?

00:09.075 --> 00:10.677
A lot of ladies get right in the car

00:10.677 --> 00:12.679
after that line, you creepy piece of...

00:12.679 --> 00:14.112
Jack!

00:17.350 --> 00:18.351
What do ya...

00:18.351 --> 00:19.352
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.588
Oh, hi.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.156
When did you get
back from D.C.?

00:23.156 --> 00:24.858
How did you get out
of your government job?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.860
Uh, I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.661
That information
is classified

00:28.661 --> 00:29.829
at least until
Cheney dies.

00:29.829 --> 00:31.364
Which is going to be a
long time from now.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.598
That man is mostly metal.

00:32.598 --> 00:35.535
The important
thing is I'm here

00:35.535 --> 00:37.203
and I'm going to get
my old job back.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.005
Yes, please
come back, Jack.

00:39.005 --> 00:40.407
Devin is the worst.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.375
It's like he doesn't even
care when we should have cake

00:42.375 --> 00:44.277
for people whose birthdays
are on the weekend.

00:44.277 --> 00:45.512
The Friday before.

00:45.512 --> 00:46.479
At lunch.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.182
So what's with the
outfit, Lemon?

00:49.182 --> 00:50.383
Did the people at
that makeover show

00:50.383 --> 00:51.551
finally respond
to your letter?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.219
Ah, no, I am
dressed up

00:53.219 --> 00:55.522
because the adoption
agency is doing

00:55.522 --> 00:57.557
my home evaluation today.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.725
Just be yourself, Lemon.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.393
I'm going to be
better than myself.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.728
My apartment is spotless.

01:01.728 --> 01:03.363
I have practiced
all my answers.

01:03.363 --> 01:04.998
I got rid of all my
Colin Firth movies

01:04.998 --> 01:06.566
in case they
consider them erotica.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.834
That man can
wear a sweater.

01:07.834 --> 01:09.825
There is no chance
that I'm blowing this.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.155 --> 01:30.490
What can I
do for you, Jack?

01:30.490 --> 01:32.926
Devin, I know we've had
our battles in the past

01:32.926 --> 01:34.194
but I want to offer
my assistance

01:34.194 --> 01:35.328
to you and Kathy.

01:36.696 --> 01:38.364
That's funny, Jack.

01:38.364 --> 01:41.668
You see, only thing Kathy
and I need assistance with

01:41.668 --> 01:45.038
is deciding which John
Mayer song to do it to.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.372
Oh, come on, Banks.

01:46.372 --> 01:48.608
You sold off Small Appliances.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.610
Sheinhardt Wigs missed
projections for last quarter.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.613
And I hear that theme
park fire didn't destroy

01:53.613 --> 01:55.849
any of the stuff
it was supposed to.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.183
Rumor has it you're
in over your head.

01:57.183 --> 02:00.987
Well, you know what they
say about rumors, Jack.

02:00.987 --> 02:02.921
They make a "rue" out
of "more" and "S."

02:04.057 --> 02:05.558
Yes, we've had some setbacks.

02:05.558 --> 02:09.362
but Kathy and I have
everything under control.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.131
Ah!

02:11.131 --> 02:14.400
Don't even think about talking
to her when her soaps are on.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.668
Seriously, she will bite you.

02:15.668 --> 02:17.670
You owe me a job, Banks.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.239
You know her father
wanted me to take over

02:19.239 --> 02:20.406
before he slipped
into that coma.

02:20.406 --> 02:23.376
If there's one thing
I learned from you, Jack,

02:23.376 --> 02:27.313
it's keep your
friends close

02:27.313 --> 02:28.915
and your enemies so close

02:28.915 --> 02:30.849
that you're almost kissing.

02:36.356 --> 02:39.859
So that's why I'm gonna
offer you a job...

02:39.859 --> 02:41.194
in the mail room.

02:44.597 --> 02:45.564
I'll take it.

02:46.399 --> 02:47.867
Great news, guys!

02:47.867 --> 02:50.631
I just got a residual check from
that Japanese commercial I did.

02:55.675 --> 02:59.112
I still don't know how that
advertised Tokyo University.

02:59.112 --> 03:03.014
But I'm gonna use this $300 to
buy us all some boots for me.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.185
It's official!

03:05.185 --> 03:06.452
I'm a genius.

03:06.452 --> 03:07.453
My video game

03:07.453 --> 03:09.222
is selling through the rizznoof!

03:09.222 --> 03:11.891
Well, how far through
the "rizznoof"?

03:11.891 --> 03:13.159
Whoa, that's not slang.

03:13.159 --> 03:15.195
He has a speech impediment.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.131
61 million copies at $60 each.

03:18.131 --> 03:22.569
Well, you know, you didn't make
this video game alone, Tracy.

03:22.569 --> 03:23.603
A lot of people helped.

03:23.603 --> 03:24.737
I don't know.

03:24.737 --> 03:25.772
I think I did it alone...

03:25.772 --> 03:29.868
and this check
is the prizznoof.

03:31.244 --> 03:35.078
Now that one was just
him being obnoxious.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.386
Thank you.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.387
Jack?

03:41.387 --> 03:43.189
I'm back, Lemon.

03:43.189 --> 03:44.857
Devin thought he
could humiliate me.

03:44.857 --> 03:46.593
But he doesn't understand
that I've worked my way up

03:46.593 --> 03:47.827
from the bottom before
and I can do it again.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.596
The last time, it
took me 22 years.

03:49.596 --> 03:51.631
But I know so much
more now this time.

03:51.631 --> 03:52.765
I think I can do it in nine.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.400
So you're gonna be
a mail room guy?

03:54.400 --> 03:56.336
I'm the head mail room guy.

03:56.336 --> 03:58.463
I've already been promoted
once since this morning.

03:58.671 --> 03:59.372
That's pretty fast.

03:59.372 --> 04:00.306
With a little hard work,

04:00.306 --> 04:01.541
I'll be back to V.P. status

04:01.541 --> 04:02.609
before I'm 60.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.611
And if my home
evaluation goes well

04:04.611 --> 04:07.113
I will be a mother by 50.

04:07.113 --> 04:08.808
We really can have it all.

04:13.553 --> 04:15.822
What was your reason
for wanting to adopt?

04:15.822 --> 04:17.557
Thank you for that question, Bev.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.625
The world is a troubled place.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.662
And with so many children
in need of adoption worldwide,

04:22.662 --> 04:23.863
Any other...

04:23.863 --> 04:25.465
Infertility... or "other"?

04:25.465 --> 04:26.432
"Other".

04:27.333 --> 04:28.468
How old are you, Liz?

04:28.468 --> 04:29.636
Thirty-seven.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.170
I should tell you right now

04:31.170 --> 04:33.206
it's important that
you don't lie.

04:33.206 --> 04:37.176
How often do you entertain
gentlemen sex guests?

04:37.176 --> 04:38.578
Oh, boy, that's uh...

04:38.578 --> 04:39.846
Once a year maybe?

04:39.846 --> 04:41.381
But I'd be open to cutting that down.

04:41.381 --> 04:42.849
Is that a safety thing?

04:42.849 --> 04:44.050
Because I can fix that.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.419
You ever run a webcam
ring outta here, Liz?

04:46.419 --> 04:47.720
Gentlemen tell you
what to do, you do it?

04:47.720 --> 04:50.456
At first with some feigned hesitation?

04:50.456 --> 04:52.025
No!

04:52.025 --> 04:54.220
Is that on the form?

04:54.994 --> 04:57.130
Have you ever been
convicted of a crime?

04:57.130 --> 05:00.199
I was arrested once in
Germany for public nudity.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.734
I thought it was a topless beach.

05:01.734 --> 05:03.369
It was a shipyard.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.974
You're a T.V. writer, Liz?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.542
How many hours per
week do you work?

05:09.542 --> 05:11.144
Between 60 and 80.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.248
Is that a work call?

05:15.248 --> 05:16.416
Could be.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.885
Or it could be
my annual sex guest.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.387
Your work life seems
very demanding.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.252
Maybe I should pop
by there tomorrow.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.525
Ms. Geiss, I have your
Soap Opera Digest.

05:30.563 --> 05:32.832
Kathy, this can't be easy for you.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.269
Your father, such a great
leader, trapped in a coma.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.072
All this responsibility
heaped on your...

05:39.072 --> 05:41.341
young shoulders.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.042
With all due
respect to Devin,

05:43.042 --> 05:46.579
he's a party boy with
a grown man's job.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.348
He can't handle it.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.615
I want to be of service.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.014
Let me help you.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.880
Oh!

05:55.855 --> 05:58.983
Oh!

06:01.527 --> 06:03.129
Hey, could I have everyone's
attention please?

06:03.129 --> 06:05.131
Hi...

06:05.131 --> 06:08.301
There is a woman coming
by the office today.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.036
Ooh-woo!

06:10.036 --> 06:11.037
No, stop it.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.271
Her name is Bev

06:12.271 --> 06:15.708
and she is evaluating
me for an adoption.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.976
Ooh-woo!

06:16.976 --> 06:18.811
Morons.

06:18.811 --> 06:21.781
I need everyone to be
on their best behavior.

06:21.781 --> 06:22.815
No cursing.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.250
Please take down any pornography

06:24.250 --> 06:26.650
that you have in your office.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.155
Nothing weird.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.157
Aw, come on, it's
Movie Party Thursday.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.092
I brought in my tape of circus accidents.

06:33.092 --> 06:34.660
No, no.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.562
Please, A lion eats a sad clown.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.630
Tomorrow.

06:37.630 --> 06:40.066
Please, just be normal sauce for one day.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.363
And change that hat.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.570
Oh, Pete.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.705
I you to call the
set design guys

06:45.705 --> 06:48.241
and have them make the
green room into a nursery.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.435
I may have lied
about some stuff.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.045
Liz...

06:53.045 --> 06:54.347
I have a serious issue.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.749
Oh, I told you not to write
back to your stalker.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.018
Oh, no, this is not about Yolanda.

06:59.018 --> 07:01.521
Listen, Tracy keeps
bragging about all the money

07:01.521 --> 07:03.189
he's making off of his stupid video game

07:03.189 --> 07:05.958
Meanwhile, those of us
who did the voice acting

07:05.958 --> 07:07.360
weren't even compensated.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.529
I mean, I don't do
anything for Yolanda

07:09.529 --> 07:11.230
and she sends me those headless dolls.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.232
Well, I was not supposed say anything,

07:13.232 --> 07:16.235
but he has something very special planned.

07:16.235 --> 07:17.770
I'll believe that
when I see it.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.539
Well, you will see and then
you are gonna be embarrassed

07:19.539 --> 07:20.940
that we had this
conversation.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.999
Can I hide this box of penis
pasta in your dressing room?

07:24.811 --> 07:25.978
Lemon?

07:25.978 --> 07:27.980
Psst.

07:27.980 --> 07:28.981
She touched me.

07:28.981 --> 07:30.116
Who?

07:30.116 --> 07:32.785
Kathy Geiss, she touched
me in my swimsuit area.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.554
No... Kathy?

07:34.554 --> 07:36.155
It made me very
uncomfortable.

07:36.155 --> 07:37.657
It's not at all
erotic and fun,

07:37.657 --> 07:38.758
Iike when men
do it to women.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.326
Have you ever been
sexually harassed?

07:40.326 --> 07:41.894
Of course not.
Of course not.

07:41.894 --> 07:44.564
How far would I have to let
her go to get my job back?

07:44.564 --> 07:45.565
Are we talking over the shirt?

07:45.565 --> 07:46.699
Frontsies, backsies?

07:46.699 --> 07:48.968
Or would I really have
to give her my gift?

07:48.968 --> 07:49.969
Ew.

07:49.969 --> 07:50.970
Oh, what am I
talking about?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.338
I can't go through with this.

07:52.338 --> 07:54.006
If I pleasure Kathy
to get my old job,

07:54.006 --> 07:55.675
I'm no better than Devin.

07:55.675 --> 07:58.444
The only path is
the virtuous path.

07:58.444 --> 07:59.579
Even if it takes
five years.

07:59.579 --> 08:00.646
I thought you
said nine years?

08:00.646 --> 08:01.948
I was promoted
again this morning.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.516
I'm now Director
of Mail Systems.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.746
Ha... oh.

08:09.288 --> 08:11.290
Nice work, Hornberger.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.658
Are these dolls?

08:12.658 --> 08:13.860
Are they?

08:13.860 --> 08:15.261
Mommy.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.696
They're called Little Creepers.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.131
Is it so wrong that I just
want to have one of these

08:19.131 --> 08:20.266
to grow up and resent me?

08:20.266 --> 08:21.893
Oh, you will.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.909
Hey, Tracy, did you see that
thing in the paper today

08:29.909 --> 08:33.111
about how Lil' Wayne...
that's a person, right?

08:33.111 --> 08:38.583
Anyway, Lil' Wayne, every time
one of his albums drops,

08:38.583 --> 08:41.644
he buys diamond watches for
everybody that worked on it.

08:43.322 --> 08:45.825
I know what you're
hinting at, Liz Lemon.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.393
I should get my rap
career going again.

08:47.393 --> 08:48.995
All in due time.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.163
No, I want you to
get presents for

08:51.163 --> 08:53.332
everyone who helped
you with your video game.

08:53.332 --> 08:54.333
Especially Jenna.

08:54.333 --> 08:58.037
Noblesse oblige, yes.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.171
Let's go shopping.

08:59.171 --> 09:00.502
To the Batmobile!

09:02.308 --> 09:05.111
Don't worry, he's just leasing it.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.078
Oh, good.

09:06.946 --> 09:09.949
What I'm saying is don't
dress for the job you have,

09:09.949 --> 09:11.751
dress for the job
you want to have.

09:11.751 --> 09:12.752
So now, Manny...

09:12.752 --> 09:14.620
Tomorrow I show up for work

09:14.620 --> 09:15.985
dressed as a Mexican wrestler.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.091
Ow, ow.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.226
Banks?

09:20.226 --> 09:20.960
Jack...

09:20.960 --> 09:22.295
Good God, what
are you doing here?

09:22.295 --> 09:23.629
Where are your shoes?

09:23.629 --> 09:24.797
Oh, damn it.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.299
Must have left them in...

09:26.299 --> 09:27.366
my business meeting.

09:27.366 --> 09:28.868
Banks, you've got to
get a hold of yourself.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.102
You've got a
company to run.

09:30.102 --> 09:31.804
Oh, I'm running it.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.240
I have a plan to quadruple
profits by the year 2015.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.741
How are you possibly going to do that?

09:35.741 --> 09:38.544
The old-fashioned
way, Jack.

09:38.544 --> 09:39.636
I'm gonna shut it down.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.149
I'm gonna shut the whole
thing down for two years.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.551
I mean, imagine how badly people
will want light bulbs then.

09:45.551 --> 09:46.986
Are you insane?

09:46.986 --> 09:48.321
Think about the jobs,
the economy.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.722
This is G.E.

09:49.722 --> 09:50.823
It's just "G" now, Jack.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.124
I sold the "E" to Samsung.

09:52.124 --> 09:53.259
They're "Samesung" now.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.260
I was supposed to be
at a board meeting

09:54.260 --> 09:55.595
five hours ago.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.062
Which way's Connecticut?

10:03.502 --> 10:05.705
Oh, hi, may I help you?

10:05.705 --> 10:07.006
Ah, I'm Bev.

10:07.006 --> 10:09.542
I'm here to do Liz's adoption evaluation.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.810
Of course!

10:10.810 --> 10:12.812
I think adoption
is a wonderful thing.

10:12.812 --> 10:16.015
Three of my nine
siblings were adopted.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.880
And someday, I'm
gonna find them.

10:18.684 --> 10:19.685
Bev, hi!

10:19.685 --> 10:21.921
Thank you, Kenneth.

10:21.921 --> 10:24.357
So this is our studio.

10:24.357 --> 10:27.860
It would be a really fun
place for a kid to grow up.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.295
Lots of costumes...

10:31.297 --> 10:32.999
Watch out, you idiot!

10:32.999 --> 10:34.000
Jackass!

10:34.000 --> 10:35.701
We're like a
big family here.

10:35.701 --> 10:36.702
Hey, Rick.

10:36.702 --> 10:37.703
I'm Fred.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.568
Rick is the other black guy.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.141
Happens to everyone,
right, Bev?

10:42.141 --> 10:45.042
Yeah, happens all the
time to my black husband.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.784
Well, I first met Liz in 1993.

10:51.784 --> 10:52.985
She was fresh out of college

10:52.985 --> 10:55.221
and I had just broken
up with O. J. Simpson.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.455
And can I just say something?

10:56.455 --> 10:57.422
Total gentleman.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.826
Liz is a really, really mature person

11:00.826 --> 11:03.362
and she totally deserves to
get custody of her kids.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.964
It's not a custody case.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.699
Liz is trying to
adopt a child.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.602
Then who were those kids you
were yelling at the other day?

11:09.602 --> 11:11.837
Those were
some child actors

11:11.837 --> 11:14.806
who had lied about being
able to breakdance.

11:15.574 --> 11:18.210
Actually, I lived with Liz while
I was separated from my wife.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.680
In a platonic way.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.114
But I haven't lived there
for a couple months now

11:22.114 --> 11:23.916
because I've been at an anger
management treatment center

11:23.916 --> 11:27.647
'cause I shot one of my
co-workers with an arrow.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.023
I think it's a circus
in the Philippines.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.693
The lion goes nuts and
attacks this older clown.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.494
How did we start
talking about this?

11:35.494 --> 11:36.722
Did you bring it up?

11:40.366 --> 11:42.968
I'm so sorry, would you excuse
us for a moment, please?

11:42.968 --> 11:44.603
How is your thing going?

11:44.603 --> 11:46.005
Not terrific,
I'm not sure she's...

11:46.005 --> 11:47.640
Lemon, I don't
have five years.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.641
What?

11:48.641 --> 11:50.209
Devin's lost it.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.378
I've got to stop him before
this whole thing implodes.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.213
He wants to shut
down the company.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.381
What are you talking about?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.750
I've got to go now while
Devin's in Connecticut.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.085
I'm doing this for the greater good.

11:59.085 --> 12:00.219
What are you saying?

12:00.219 --> 12:03.518
I'm going upstairs to doink Kathy Geiss.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.463
Tracy Jordan's not here right now,

12:10.463 --> 12:12.598
but he's great, it's a
shame you won't get to meet him.

12:12.598 --> 12:13.733
Attention, everyone!

12:13.733 --> 12:15.968
Hey, great.

12:15.968 --> 12:17.136
I'd like to take this opportunity

12:17.136 --> 12:20.005
to thank everyone involved
in making my video game

12:20.005 --> 12:23.175
the most profitable thing
since the war on terror.

12:23.175 --> 12:26.378
Yes, I am provocative.

12:26.378 --> 12:27.580
Frank, for all
your hard work,

12:27.580 --> 12:30.449
please accept this set
of solid gold nunchucks.

12:30.449 --> 12:32.815
I will use these
only for good.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.923
Petey Pete!

12:37.923 --> 12:39.959
For letting us use the sound booth

12:39.959 --> 12:42.094
Please accept this
chinchilla coat.

12:42.094 --> 12:43.429
Wow.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.364
You're gonna get so
much nice-nice in that

12:45.364 --> 12:46.465
you're gonna have to
grow an another ding...

12:46.465 --> 12:48.067
Tracy, this is Bev.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.602
The lady from
the adoption thing.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.570
Bev...

12:52.471 --> 12:53.873
Now you look out for
my girl, Liz Lemon

12:53.873 --> 12:55.341
'Cause me and
her go way back

12:55.341 --> 12:57.002
Iike spinal cords
and car seats.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.704
That's not really an expression.

13:01.647 --> 13:02.915
Mr. Banks!

13:02.915 --> 13:05.084
I thought you were going
to Connecticut today.

13:05.084 --> 13:06.085
I blew it off.

13:06.085 --> 13:07.219
Nice to see you, Liz, Let's chit-chat.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.454
What's that, man
trouble, boot cut jeans?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.421
Fun! Bye.

13:10.656 --> 13:11.957
Kenneth, It is
imperative that

13:11.957 --> 13:14.560
you keep Mr. Banks down
here until I can get to Jack.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.661
Do you know what
imperative means?

13:15.661 --> 13:16.796
Tell me, tell me!

13:16.796 --> 13:18.263
Important, It
means important.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.667
I'll just be a minute, Bev.

13:21.667 --> 13:22.668
Mr. Banks...

13:22.668 --> 13:24.966
Iook how many pushups I can do.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.307
Devin's here!

13:37.016 --> 13:39.610
Cover yourself.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.196
You smell like
strawberries.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.598
That's the lip
gloss she put on me

13:52.598 --> 13:54.122
so I could be
her fancy boy.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.871
Is this the way my life
is supposed to play out?

13:58.871 --> 14:01.540
The kid who walked four
miles every Saturday to caddy

14:01.540 --> 14:04.143
because mother said that golf
was a game for businessmen.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.411
Paid his way
through Princeton

14:05.411 --> 14:07.146
by working the day
shift at that graveyard

14:07.146 --> 14:08.773
and the graveyard
shift at that Days Inn.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.251
Twenty two years of
single-mindedly fighting

14:12.251 --> 14:13.752
my way to the top
of this company.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.422
Thank God I don't have your
biological need for children.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.756
That would make
success impossible.

14:17.756 --> 14:18.891
Thanks.

14:18.891 --> 14:21.327
This job is all I've ever wanted, Lemon.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.662
And now it hinges on how far
I'm willing to go with a woman

14:23.662 --> 14:25.130
in Dora the Explorer panties

14:25.130 --> 14:26.732
that were clearly made
for an obese child.

14:26.732 --> 14:28.234
Are you sure
she wants sex?

14:28.234 --> 14:29.835
Maybe she's just
looking for attention.

14:29.835 --> 14:33.105
Her whole world is stuffed
unicorns and soap operas.

14:33.105 --> 14:34.940
Aren't soap operas
all about sex?

14:34.940 --> 14:36.842
No way, the best
part of soap operas

14:36.842 --> 14:38.811
is when someone's twin
interrupts a wedding.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.080
Or somebody pulls a gun
at the fitness center.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.181
Hold on a second.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.782
Kathy's texting me now.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.418
She's wondering where my
strawberry mouth is.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.020
Oh, nerds, it's Bev.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.588
Please be charming.

14:49.588 --> 14:50.990
Hello, Bev, I'm Jack Donaghy.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.892
Have you had a tour of
our magnificent studio?

14:52.892 --> 14:53.893
I have not.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.361
Well, right this way.

14:55.361 --> 14:56.595
This is what you're
giving me as a thank you gift?

14:56.595 --> 14:58.130
Some coupons
for free hugs?

14:58.130 --> 15:00.466
I'm suing you for my share of
your video game profits, Tracy.

15:00.466 --> 15:01.734
You're gonna sue me?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.258
Would you like to
see the green room?

15:04.536 --> 15:05.537
What?

15:05.537 --> 15:06.504
You mean the nursery!

15:08.307 --> 15:09.341
We gotta get this stuff

15:09.341 --> 15:11.243
back to the rental place by 5:00.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.080
Dear God.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.283
Ms. Lemon, did you lie to me

15:17.283 --> 15:18.417
about there being a nursery here?

15:18.417 --> 15:19.752
No!

15:19.752 --> 15:20.753
Rick, what are you doing?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.778
Bitch, my
name is Fred.

15:24.623 --> 15:26.558
This is very
disturbing, Liz.

15:26.558 --> 15:28.082
This is a very
serious breach of trust.

15:28.193 --> 15:30.062
Bev, allow
me to explain.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.164
I've been mentoring
Lemon for some time now.

15:32.164 --> 15:33.165
Are you her boss?

15:33.165 --> 15:34.325
No, I work in
the mailroom.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.204
Kathy, Bev and I
are just friends.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.074
Kathy's the new
CEO of our company.

15:44.109 --> 15:45.210
Bev, you better run.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.268
She's surprisingly strong.

15:56.588 --> 15:59.216
Frank, I told you to change that hat!

16:00.526 --> 16:01.857
God, how can I
have a kid here?

16:02.027 --> 16:04.052
I can't even keep a grown
woman safe in this place.

16:05.397 --> 16:06.398
"Unsatisfactory"?

16:07.700 --> 16:08.667
Are you okay, Bev?

16:09.034 --> 16:10.001
You had quite
a fall there.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.539
Ah, I'm Bev.

16:13.539 --> 16:15.507
I'm here to do Liz's
adoption evaluation.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.977
Why, yes.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.878
Hello, Bev, did
you just get here?

16:19.878 --> 16:22.815
Yes, I'm here to do Liz's
adoption evaluation.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.850
Where's my clicky pen?

16:24.850 --> 16:26.151
I get a do-over.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.820
No, we have to take
her to a hospital.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.821
20 minutes.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.812
Just give me 20 minutes.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.425
Do-over!

16:33.425 --> 16:35.694
Do-over, she doesn't
remember anything!

16:35.694 --> 16:37.329
You heard what the lady said,
we're taking a mulligan.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.387
Let's make this one count now.

16:38.998 --> 16:39.999
It's time, Lemon.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.066
Kathy's texted me that Devin's gone.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.067
I have to go upstairs.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.202
What are you gonna do?

16:43.202 --> 16:44.336
I'm gonna give Kathy
the full soap opera

16:44.336 --> 16:46.205
while you try to trick a
lady with a head injury.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.473
We might not be
the best people.

16:47.473 --> 16:48.640
But we're not the worst?

16:48.640 --> 16:51.744
Graduate students are the worst.

16:51.744 --> 16:53.078
Hi, I'm Bev,
let's get started.

16:53.078 --> 16:55.481
Right this way.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.583
I know Liz would be a wonderful mother.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.152
Because she is intelligent and kind.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.721
She reminds me of my own mom.

17:02.721 --> 17:05.124
Tough love, consistency,

17:05.124 --> 17:06.992
a little moustache in a certain light.

17:06.992 --> 17:09.661
And her other kids really like her.

17:09.661 --> 17:10.662
What?

17:10.662 --> 17:11.797
Hey, Fred.

17:11.797 --> 17:13.799
Hey.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.068
Well, I think I've seen
everything I need to see.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.069
Man, do I have a headache.

17:18.069 --> 17:19.304
Let's get down to brass tacks.

17:19.304 --> 17:22.307
Liz, as a single woman
with a demanding job

17:22.307 --> 17:23.642
working in such a...

17:23.642 --> 17:26.509
well, nontraditional environment

17:26.744 --> 17:29.043
I'm sorry, but you're
not an ideal candidate.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.917
But we did everything
perfect this time.

17:31.917 --> 17:32.618
Hmmm?

17:32.618 --> 17:33.552
Bev, listen to me.

17:33.552 --> 17:36.822
Yes, I work very hard
almost all the time.

17:36.822 --> 17:40.325
But I feel my life will
open up and make room

17:40.325 --> 17:41.827
just the same way that my heart

17:41.827 --> 17:44.263
will open up and make room
when I meet this baby.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.565
And yes, this place is not ideal

17:46.565 --> 17:48.300
but these weirdos are family to me.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.969
And so if this job
is a deal breaker

17:50.969 --> 17:54.837
then tear up my application and
I'll start over someplace else.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.548
I wish there were
a box on these forms

18:02.548 --> 18:04.116
where I could check
off "passion".

18:04.116 --> 18:07.086
Because that is
exactly the kind of

18:07.086 --> 18:09.788
warmth and assertiveness
that we are looking for.

18:09.788 --> 18:12.224
I am going to reconsider
your recommendation.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.526
Oh, Bev, thank you.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.357
Thank you, Bev.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.095
Oh...

18:20.933 --> 18:22.101
I'm Bev.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.269
I'm here to do Liz's
adoption evaluation.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.804
Ah!

18:25.804 --> 18:28.864
All right, take her to the hospital.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.709
Let's get started!

18:34.313 --> 18:35.314
What are you doing?

18:35.314 --> 18:36.315
Get upstairs!

18:36.315 --> 18:37.316
Jonathan, not now.

18:37.316 --> 18:38.317
Yes, now!

18:38.317 --> 18:39.551
Jack kicked me
out of the office.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.678
He's about to debase
himself to save the company.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.991
Don't do this, If you do,
you're just as bad as Devin!

18:45.991 --> 18:49.188
Liz, what are
you doing here?

18:50.662 --> 18:53.165
I thought you were at the
fitness center with your twin?

18:53.165 --> 18:54.530
What?

18:56.001 --> 18:58.003
Liz, it's not
what you think.

18:58.003 --> 18:59.338
Kathy and I are just
working together.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.640
Kathy, you know
my lover, Liz.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.909
That better
be true, Jack.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.277
Or I'll make both
of you disappear

19:05.277 --> 19:08.007
just like I did with
Vivienne and Patch.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.949
Don't be ridiculous, Liz.

19:10.949 --> 19:14.786
You know you're the only
woman I've ever really loved.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.922
Kathy is my partner.

19:16.922 --> 19:19.291
She's hiring me to advise
her in all her business matters.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.485
Isn't that true, Kathy?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.629
I'm sorry, darling.

19:23.629 --> 19:26.154
I've been paranoid ever
since that incident

19:26.532 --> 19:28.534
with the weather machine.

19:28.534 --> 19:31.594
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

19:36.542 --> 19:38.076
No...

19:38.076 --> 19:39.100
No, thank you.

19:42.147 --> 19:43.549
Got any mail for me, Donaghy?

19:43.549 --> 19:46.318
It's all over, Banks.

19:46.318 --> 19:47.686
Kathy has hired me,
privately,

19:47.686 --> 19:49.254
to advise her in all
business matters.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.924
My God, that's
her signature.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.026
Yeah.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.561
Ah, well, I'm
not stupid, Jack.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.663
I saw this day coming.

19:57.663 --> 20:01.667
But I've already made provisions
for my financial future.

20:01.667 --> 20:02.861
Check this out.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.774
I'm gonna sue you!

20:08.774 --> 20:10.709
I'm going to sue the
entire city of New York!

20:10.709 --> 20:12.010
I'm gonna sue you!

20:12.010 --> 20:14.680
You can't sue me,
I'm already being sued.

20:14.680 --> 20:15.806
Double indemnity!

20:26.124 --> 20:27.125
Lemon?

20:27.125 --> 20:28.393
How's your friend Bev?

20:28.393 --> 20:31.196
Unfortunately, Bev has
made a full recovery.

20:31.196 --> 20:34.366
So I have to start over
with another agency.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.201
This might take a
long time, actually.

20:36.201 --> 20:39.004
The semi-virtuous path.

20:39.004 --> 20:39.971
You won't regret it.

20:48.213 --> 20:49.715
Did you need something
else, Lemon?

20:49.715 --> 20:52.980
No, I just like
seeing you in there.
