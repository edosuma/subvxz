Hey, Ally, guess who got
a job at cupcake city.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.940
Thanks, Trish, but there's
no eating in the store.

00:20.010 --> 00:22.340
But I do like cupcakes.
Gimme that.

00:22.410 --> 00:24.310
Yeah, they give us
all the rejects.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.380
That one I dropped on the floor.

00:29.050 --> 00:30.920
That's what I get for
breaking the rules.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.960
Hey, do you want to
go to a movie Sunday?

00:33.020 --> 00:35.360
Oh, I'd love to
go to the movies.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.860
Oh, um, great.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.530
Because you're exactly
the person I was asking.

00:40.600 --> 00:44.200
- It's a date!
- Can't wait, lady-I've-never-met.

00:45.330 --> 00:48.040
- Oh, where'd you go?
- I was on the phone.

00:48.100 --> 00:51.770
That was work. Apparently "being
there" is part of the job.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.240
Gotta go. Hey, Mr. Dawson.

00:55.310 --> 00:58.140
Guess who found 37 more cents.

00:58.210 --> 01:01.550
Dad, stop taking money out of the mall
fountain. Those are people's wishes.

01:01.620 --> 01:04.950
My wish came true. I
have 37 more cents.

01:05.019 --> 01:07.790
Well, speaking of wishes:
Dad, is there any way

01:07.860 --> 01:10.020
I could put a piano upstairs
in my practice room?

01:10.090 --> 01:12.630
The one I'm using is older than
the lady I'm dating Sunday.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.830
Long story.

01:15.900 --> 01:19.670
Honey, I know you love music,

01:19.730 --> 01:23.000
But the odds of making it in the music
biz are like a bazillion to one.

01:23.070 --> 01:24.700
C'mere.

01:26.210 --> 01:27.710
Boom!

01:30.880 --> 01:33.650
And action!

01:39.990 --> 01:42.520
Did you not see the "please
do not play the drums" sign?

01:42.590 --> 01:44.990
It's okay. I'm an
awesome drummer.

01:46.620 --> 01:49.290
What you just said has nothing
to do with what I just said.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.060
- Are those corn dogs?
- Mm-hmm.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.070
Ew. Do you know how
dirty these drums are.

01:55.130 --> 01:58.100
And how unhealthy corn dogs are and
there's no food allowed in here?

01:58.170 --> 02:02.070
I'll handle this, Austin. Ma'am,
we are making a music video.

02:02.140 --> 02:05.010
I am the director, although I
prefer the term filmmaker.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.080
And cut!

02:08.139 --> 02:11.180
We're gonna need a lot of instruments.
I can play anything...

02:11.250 --> 02:13.420
Piano, drums, guitar, harp.

02:13.480 --> 02:16.720
I can even play a trumpet
through another trumpet.

Great! Just have your Butler
fly over on your private jet.

02:52.690 --> 02:55.120
- And drop off a sack of shiny gold coins.

good magicians.

12:10.180 --> 12:12.240
Hey, welcome back.

12:12.310 --> 12:15.250
Our next guest is overnight
Internet sensation

12:15.310 --> 12:16.980
Austin moon!

12:20.580 --> 12:22.720
- It's go time.
- I can't do this.

12:22.790 --> 12:24.836
There's a stage out there. You
know I have stage fright.

12:24.860 --> 12:26.920
I know it's scary,
but you can do it.

12:26.990 --> 12:29.990
I'm here for you. You just
take all the time you need.

12:30.060 --> 12:32.700
- Thanks, Trish. I really appreciate...
- Time's up.

12:32.760 --> 12:35.900
Hold everything! We're here
to tell you the truth.

12:35.970 --> 12:37.600
That guy is a weasel!

12:37.670 --> 12:39.700
And not like a cute weasel
you'd want as a pet.

12:39.770 --> 12:41.800
More of a lying evil
weasel who steals music!

12:41.870 --> 12:44.270
He's never even written a song.
Because he can't!

12:44.340 --> 12:46.480
And...

12:46.540 --> 12:48.680
This isn't "the Helen show."

12:48.740 --> 12:50.240
This just in.

12:50.310 --> 12:52.880

- It's too bad

13:26.780 --> 13:29.650
'cause we would love to hear
you do another original song.

13:29.720 --> 13:32.450
Darn! I've written
<i>so</i> many songs.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.220
I wish you had more time.

13:34.290 --> 13:36.990
How about you come
back tomorrow?

13:37.060 --> 13:38.860
Tomorrow?

13:38.930 --> 13:40.560
- Yeah.
- Another original song?

13:40.630 --> 13:42.190
- Uh-huh.
- By tomorrow?

13:42.260 --> 13:43.930
That's what I said.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.230
- Um um, I...
- Oh, come on.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.670
You don't want to let down all your fans.
Right, austies?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.400
Yeah.

13:51.470 --> 13:53.640
Um, okay.

13:53.710 --> 13:55.910
- Tomorrow it is?
- Oh, you heard it right here, folks!

13:55.970 --> 13:59.080
Austin will be back tomorrow
to do a new original song!

13:59.140 --> 14:00.210
Yes!

14:16.030 --> 14:19.360
Guess who got a job
at the pet store!

14:19.430 --> 14:21.460
Roof roof meow!

14:23.400 --> 14:26.600
You didn't even work at the magic shop
two days. That's gotta be a new record.

14:26.670 --> 14:29.600
I plan obebeing better at this job...
after this.

14:31.210 --> 14:34.110
Has anyone seen a giant
snake about yea big?

14:34.180 --> 14:35.910
Oh, he's probably not poisonous,

14:35.980 --> 14:38.410
But there's a really good chance
that he's totally poisonous.

14:40.650 --> 14:43.180
- Ally, I need your help.
- Speaking of giant snakes.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.320
- I need a new song by tomorrow.
- Ha! Why don't you just write a song?

14:46.390 --> 14:47.860
You know I can't. I've tried.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.190

15:15.550 --> 15:17.320
I didn't mean to
steal your song.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.350
<i>Then I acted like a weasel.</i>

15:19.420 --> 15:21.220
Not a cute cuddly weasel,

15:21.290 --> 15:23.960
But a jerky
no-credit-giving weasel.

15:24.020 --> 15:25.990
I'm sorry.

15:29.900 --> 15:33.200
Who am I kidding? My dad always
said music was a waste of time.

15:33.270 --> 15:36.300
He said I had a bazillion
to one chance of making it.

15:36.370 --> 15:40.840
That's exactly what
my dad said to me.

15:40.910 --> 15:44.940
Do you know what my dad said to me?
"dez, stop texting the dog!"

15:48.050 --> 15:50.580
I guess my 15 minutes
of fame are over.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.320
I just wanted to
prove my dad wrong.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.150
Austin, wait!

15:59.820 --> 16:01.390
I'll help you write
one more song.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.760
- You will? Yes!
- Whoo!

16:03.830 --> 16:05.403
Thank you, thank you!

16:05.415 --> 16:07.000
But first you have to
do something for me!

16:07.060 --> 16:08.360
Anything. Name it.

16:08.430 --> 16:12.030
Uh uh, I want a... a...

16:12.100 --> 16:14.240
I... I want a... a ham!

16:17.710 --> 16:21.380
- Did you just say a ham?
- Apparently I did.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.680
Here, you can give her
my ham if you want.

16:31.820 --> 16:33.450
Okay, we have 18 hours.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.420
To write the greatest song ever.
Go!

16:35.490 --> 16:37.960
Oh, um, it's not that easy.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.590
I'll get you started.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.160
There. That's the first note.
That helps, right?

16:44.630 --> 16:48.070
Gee, are you sure you've
never written a song before?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.940
What do you normally do?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.540
Well, there isn't a "normally."

16:51.610 --> 16:53.110
Sometimes I get a
tune in my head.

16:53.170 --> 16:55.670
Sometimes I think of a
lyric and write it down.

16:55.740 --> 16:57.840
Never touch my book.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.619
- What do you got?
- Okay, um...

17:05.680 --> 17:07.690
"the tears of your heart cry..."

17:07.750 --> 17:09.720
- Too depressing.
- Okay.

17:09.790 --> 17:12.390
- "the midnight sadness..."
- That's even more too depressing.

17:12.460 --> 17:15.530
This song should be fun,
like a splash of sunshine.

17:15.589 --> 17:17.560
You're like a drizzle
of darkness.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.599
We need to get you to relax.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.869
You know, get your
creative juices flowing.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.740
- Shut your eyes.
- I'm not going to shut...

17:24.800 --> 17:26.670
- Just shut your eyes.
- Okay, I will.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.870
Don't touch my book.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.180
Okay. Imagine you come home.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.540
And your living room is
just full of cheerleaders.

17:34.610 --> 17:38.250
Uh, that's not really
my idea of fun.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.380
Okay, pretend you're
on stage performing...

17:41.450 --> 17:43.250
Oh, no way. I have
horrible stage fright.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.920
Then imagine you're
on the beach.

17:44.990 --> 17:47.160
Ugh. Sand's getting everywhere.

17:47.220 --> 17:49.460
Ew, is that guy really
wearing a thong?

17:49.530 --> 17:51.130
Okay, forget the beach!

17:51.190 --> 17:53.030
What do you like?

17:53.100 --> 17:57.170
- I like pickles.
- Great. Pretend you're eating a Pickle.

17:57.230 --> 17:59.970
- There's no eating in the store.
- All right!

18:00.040 --> 18:01.470
Why don't we try this:

18:01.540 --> 18:05.310
I'll close my eyes and you
tell me to imagine stuff.

18:05.370 --> 18:07.210
Okay,

18:07.280 --> 18:09.610
Imagine I'm giving up. I quit.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.780
Got it. Are there
cheerleaders there?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.050
Austin, what I'm saying is.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.590
Maybe we should just forget
this whole songwriting thing.

18:18.650 --> 18:20.720
Whoa whoa. Not so fast.

18:22.390 --> 18:25.530
- Okay, almost there.
- Uh, what are you doing?

18:25.590 --> 18:28.600
Funning you up.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.830
Oh yeah!

18:33.900 --> 18:35.330
No, I don't...

18:35.400 --> 18:37.300
We're gonna dance!

18:38.610 --> 18:41.640
No thanks... thanks.
This is silly.

19:20.180 --> 19:21.810
See? It's fun.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.480
- Ally, so, like, you can do it.
- Come on, let's groove.

19:24.550 --> 19:26.480
- C'mon, let's go.
- Okay. Whoo Whoo!

19:26.550 --> 19:28.580
- There, I'm dancing.
- Are you sure?

19:28.650 --> 19:29.946
That was like the worst
dancing I've ever seen.

19:29.958 --> 19:31.266
That is pathetic.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.390
Okay, fine. Whoo!

19:39.730 --> 19:41.930
What up?

19:45.170 --> 19:47.400
I-I... I think it worked.

19:47.470 --> 19:50.440
I feel fun. I feel like
I could do anything.

19:50.510 --> 19:53.170
Watch, I'm gonna do a cartwheel.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.410
I can't do a cartwheel.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.910
Well, don't waste the creativity.
Come on.

19:57.980 --> 19:59.980
Let's write a song.

- This song is awesome!
- Okay well, you'd better hurry.

21:12.420 --> 21:14.420
You only have one hour to
get to "the Helen show."

21:14.480 --> 21:16.850
You mean we'd tttter hurry.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.750
I want you to be there with me.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.660
Really? You mean it?

21:20.890 --> 21:23.930
I wouldn't be going on "the Helen
show" at all if it wasn't for you.

21:25.060 --> 21:26.500
- Thank you.
- Oh.

21:26.560 --> 21:27.930
Oh, uh...

21:28.000 --> 21:30.100
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

21:30.170 --> 21:31.970
- We did it!
- We finished it.

21:32.030 --> 21:34.500
We knew you could do it.
Here, we got you this.

21:34.570 --> 21:36.770
Guess who got a job
at the mug store.

21:38.040 --> 21:40.680
"congrats, we knew you could do it.
" aw, thanks.

21:40.740 --> 21:42.340
We also got you this one.

21:42.410 --> 21:45.810
"sorry you failed.
You did your best"?

21:45.880 --> 21:48.550
Well, we got you two
mugs just in case.

21:48.620 --> 21:51.550
Dez wasn't supposed
to show you that one.

21:51.620 --> 21:54.190
- Come on, we've gotta go.
- I'm going to "the Helen"...

21:54.260 --> 21:55.290
Let's go!

21:56.920 --> 22:00.190
Up next, Austin moon's
brand-new song.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.830
Millions of people are
about to hear my song.

22:04.900 --> 22:08.330
It was so worth quitting my job
at the mug store to come here.

22:08.400 --> 22:12.040
Ally, the piano player's sick.
You have to play piano for me.

22:12.110 --> 22:13.870
Uh uh, I can't. I
can't go out there.

22:13.940 --> 22:15.580
You know I have stage fright.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.310
What if they turn off
all the cameras.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.280
And everyone in the
audience goes like this?

22:19.350 --> 22:21.250
No! No way. I can't do this.

22:21.310 --> 22:23.550
No, it's really easy. Just
go left and then right.

22:23.620 --> 22:25.880
Left and right.
That's it, that's it.

22:25.950 --> 22:28.090
Look, it's like you
say in the song:

22:28.150 --> 22:30.590
Take a chance, break
down the wall.

22:32.230 --> 22:34.590
- I'm sorry.
- Wait!

22:35.660 --> 22:37.730
I have the perfect solution.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.530
<i>Okay, everybody, we're
back in 30 seconds.</i>

22:42.100 --> 22:43.900
See, Ally, nobody can see you.

22:43.970 --> 22:45.600
It's just like
you're not on stage.

22:45.670 --> 22:48.240
I'm trying really hard
not to freak out here.

22:48.310 --> 22:50.040
You're gonna be great. Trust me.

22:52.180 --> 22:53.840
Hey, welcome back.

22:53.910 --> 22:56.810
And here to sing his
brand-new original song is.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.380
Austin moon.

23:02.990 --> 23:04.950
Thank you. This
song was written.

23:05.020 --> 23:07.260
By an incredible
songwriter, Ally Dawson.

23:08.490 --> 23:10.260
She kind of wrote
my first song too.

23:10.330 --> 23:13.030
Ladies and gentlemen,
here she is.

23:17.670 --> 23:20.470
See, you're facing your fear.
That was my plan.

23:20.540 --> 23:21.700
You're welcome.

23:54.670 --> 23:57.340
L-let's hear it for
lyly, everybody.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.090
How was your date
with that old lady?

24:15.150 --> 24:16.720
She slept through
the whole movie.

24:16.790 --> 24:19.190
I had to explain the whole thing
to her on the bus ride home.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.900
My practice room?

24:25.960 --> 24:27.800
What is all this stuff?

24:27.870 --> 24:29.370
What are you guys doing here?

24:29.430 --> 24:32.800
Pickles! But look at that piano.

24:32.870 --> 24:36.610
I used the money I got from being on
"the Helen show" to pay for all this.

24:36.670 --> 24:38.780
I... I can't believe
you did this.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.263
- Thank you. - I figured we'd be

24:40.275 --> 24:41.710
spending a lot of time in here,

24:41.780 --> 24:44.020
So we should probably make it
as comfortable as possible.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.510
Uh... we?

24:45.580 --> 24:48.050
I want you to be my partner.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.020
Spend <i>more</i> time with you?

24:52.220 --> 24:54.120
You're a songwriter
with stage fright;

24:54.190 --> 24:56.260
I'm a singer who loves
being on stage.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.460
We're a perfect match.
What do you say?

25:01.230 --> 25:02.730
We're partners.

25:07.770 --> 25:10.540
Guess who got a job
as Austin's manager.

25:10.610 --> 25:14.340
She has so much job experience,
her resume was like eight pages.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.410
Oh, I promised his fans.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.880
We'd have new songs up on
the website every Friday.

25:19.950 --> 25:22.320
Oh, I don't work fridays
or other weekdays.

25:22.380 --> 25:24.890
We have to write a
new song every week?

25:24.950 --> 25:26.390
Trish, for the first video,

25:26.450 --> 25:28.420
I need 10,000 monkeys
and a big wedding cake.

25:28.490 --> 25:30.160
You can have a
turtle and a donut.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.590
I already have that.

25:33.660 --> 25:37.230
Aw, man! My video just got
bumped to number two.

25:37.300 --> 25:40.630
- What's number one?
- You on "the Helen show."

25:40.700 --> 25:44.100
Hey look, they're even showing the
part where you threw up on Helen.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.570
You're famous... thanks to me.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.780
Thanks to you. Well, let
me show you something.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.940
Here you go.

25:55.980 --> 25:57.420
Oh, me too, me too!

25:57.620 --> 25:59.540
