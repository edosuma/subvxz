00:43.640 --> 00:46.837
There was a demon that lived in the air.

00:47.320 --> 00:51.154
They said whoever challenged him
would die.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.511
Their controls would freeze up.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.074
Their planes would buffet wildly...

00:58.040 --> 00:59.951
...and they would disintegrate.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.158
The demon lived at Mach 1 on the meter...

01:07.560 --> 01:09.869
... 750 miles an hour...

01:10.200 --> 01:13.237
...where the air could no longer
move out of the way.

01:14.320 --> 01:19.394
He lived behind a barrier through
which they said no man could ever pass.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.436
They called it the sound barrier.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.796
Then they built a small plane...

01:28.920 --> 01:32.356
...the X-1, to try and break
the sound barrier.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.558
And men came to the high desert
of California to ride it.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.629
They were called test pilots...

01:45.240 --> 01:47.549
...and no one knew their names.

02:02.680 --> 02:05.558
Okay, Whiskey Kilo 28, prepare to drop.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.399
Roger, Ground Control.
This is Whiskey Kilo 28...

02:08.479 --> 02:10.835
...lowering and launching...now.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.591
Mach .92.

02:27.960 --> 02:29.871
.93.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.354
.94.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.391
Hit a mild buffet there.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.072
Mach .95.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.434
.98!

02:59.920 --> 03:01.194
.99!

03:02.640 --> 03:05.359
WK 28, do you want
to declare an emergency?

03:05.680 --> 03:08.069
Negative. WK 28 is not--

03:33.360 --> 03:35.112
Go away.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.560
"The men who fly

03:52.520 --> 03:55.478
"Through the great spaces

03:56.320 --> 03:58.675
"In the sky.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.959
"Be with them always

04:04.080 --> 04:06.389
"In the air

04:07.000 --> 04:11.835
"In darkening storms or sunlight fair.

04:16.079 --> 04:20.949
"Hear us when we lift our prayer

04:23.800 --> 04:28.271
"For all in peril

04:28.760 --> 04:32.150
"In the air."

07:17.080 --> 07:19.355
I was looking at the pictures on your wall.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.998
How come a fancy pilot...

07:21.080 --> 07:24.277
...like Slick there,
doesn't have his picture up there?

07:24.880 --> 07:27.599
What do you have to do
to get your picture up there?

07:27.680 --> 07:29.477
You have to die.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.480
Well, Yeager, you old bastard.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.870
Don't just stand in the doorway
like some lonesome sheepherder.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.116
Get your ass over here and have a drink.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.758
I got you something.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.638
You could be the first.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.638
The man who breaks the sound barrier
will be on top.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.678
You'd be the one they remembered.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.433
You're the best civilian pilot around.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.359
You get that helmet?

08:10.360 --> 08:11.634
It might work.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.677
I'll look like the Galloping Ghost in it.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.797
Some people say the sound barrier
can't be broke.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.994
An engineer will tell you it's an absolute...

08:20.080 --> 08:22.150
...like the firmness of the earth.

08:22.720 --> 08:25.712
The sound barrier is a farm
you can buy in the sky.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.077
The controls will freeze up.
You can't budge the stick.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.799
Anybody tries to break it will auger in.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.280
Well now, maybe it can't be broke.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.674
Then again...

08:39.960 --> 08:41.393
...maybe it can.

08:43.120 --> 08:47.159
Maybe it can only be broke
for a specified sum.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.029
How much?

08:52.280 --> 08:54.669
$150,000.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.508
Come on, Slick, give us a break.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.720
Non-negotiable, as usual.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.559
What do we do now?

09:08.760 --> 09:10.591
That guy in the corner....

09:11.160 --> 09:12.559
Yeager is his name.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.871
He's some kind of a war hero.
Shot down five Germans in one day.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.349
He's a natural-born stick-and-rudder man.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.558
As press-liaison man for the Air Force,
I think....

09:22.200 --> 09:23.952
Any problems with him?

09:24.280 --> 09:25.759
-Only one.
-What's that?

09:26.360 --> 09:27.793
Holding him back.

09:36.280 --> 09:39.955
We were just talking to Slick
about the sound barrier.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.753
We feel that the X-1
is ready to have a go at it.

09:43.840 --> 09:47.310
We think the X-1's got the answer
to go beyond Mach 1.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.398
If there is any beyond.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.832
So, what do you think?

09:54.720 --> 09:58.395
I'll tell you. Half these engineers
have never been off the ground.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.836
They might tell you that
the sound barrier's a brick wall.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.832
It'll rip your ears off
if you try to go through it.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.237
If you ask me,
I don't believe the damn thing even exists.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.470
Waitress, a drink for Mr. Yeager.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.073
No thanks, I got one.

10:12.920 --> 10:15.434
So, do you think
you want to have a go at it?

10:15.760 --> 10:16.875
I might.

10:17.360 --> 10:21.831
But since, as you say,
this sound barrier doesn't really exist...

10:22.680 --> 10:23.908
...how much--

10:24.080 --> 10:25.433
How much you got?

10:26.320 --> 10:29.471
Just joking.
The Air Force is already paying me. Right?

10:31.600 --> 10:32.999
So when do we go?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.752
How about tomorrow morning?

10:36.680 --> 10:37.908
I'll be there.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.279
See you there.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.111
How much are you paying him?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.909
I think it's $283.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.309
A week?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.793
A month.

10:51.280 --> 10:52.793
Well, that's not bad.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.559
First fellow to break the sound barrier...

11:00.680 --> 11:03.433
...gets a free steak with all the trimmings.

11:06.120 --> 11:08.395
I'll have mine medium rare, please.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.798
Honey, you ever been caught
on the desert alone?

11:23.200 --> 11:24.633
I never have.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.871
I don't think I ever will.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.158
Never met the man
who could catch me out there.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.913
I'm half jackrabbit.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.718
Forget it, flyboy.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.909
You'd never catch me.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.153
I believe I will.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.192
Can't be done.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.671
Could I ask you something?

12:12.080 --> 12:13.672
Forget it, sweetie.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.913
She's his wife.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.271
Glennis! I'm gonna get you!

12:39.480 --> 12:40.959
Come back here!

14:03.320 --> 14:05.390
What have you two been up to?

14:06.840 --> 14:08.273
Where's Ridley?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.352
Over there waiting on you.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.273
Can I talk to you?

14:19.320 --> 14:21.550
I got a little problem.

14:23.320 --> 14:26.949
A horse threw me last night
and I dinged up my goddamn ribs.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.189
How bad?

14:28.280 --> 14:31.158
I feel like I broke a couple
of the sons of bitches.

14:31.800 --> 14:35.315
I won't be able to lean over
to shut the door. Got any ideas?

14:35.480 --> 14:36.913
Your left side okay?

14:38.960 --> 14:42.748
I don't want these guys to know.
They'll find somebody else to fly this thing.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.671
I'll try to fix you a handle.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.075
Can you help me out?
I got a small emergency.

14:55.160 --> 14:59.233
I need to borrow your broom handle.
Just hold this right here.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.473
I think that'll work.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.712
Punch a hole in the sky.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.433
I'll be right back.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.074
How are you feeling?

15:35.160 --> 15:36.673
Oh, just about right.

16:35.640 --> 16:39.315
There she is, partner.
All bridled, saddled and ready to go.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.192
You got any Beemans?

16:42.440 --> 16:43.953
Yeah, I got a stick.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.076
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

16:46.160 --> 16:47.309
Fair enough.

17:01.360 --> 17:05.035
Stick this in the handle.
Take your good arm and just whang it.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.353
Okay, thanks, buddy.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.477
Pre-drop checklist complete.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.552
Ten...nine....

18:38.560 --> 18:39.549
Drop!

18:43.080 --> 18:44.638
There you go, buddy.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.110
Put your spurs to her, Chuck.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.998
Mach .91.

19:34.960 --> 19:35.995
.92.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.153
.93.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.192
Hit a mild buffet there.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.192
Just the usual instability.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.280
Ridley, make a note here,
would you, if you got...

19:55.360 --> 19:58.477
...nothing better to do.
Elevator effectiveness regained.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.752
.95.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.838
.96.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.754
More buffeting.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.068
More commotion.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.753
Getting wobbly here.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.829
.98.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.472
She's getting real active.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.475
.99!

20:52.040 --> 20:53.473
What's that sound?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.552
He bought the farm.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.355
That's it. We're back to square one.

21:08.800 --> 21:09.994
Wait a minute.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.869
Ridley, make another note, would you?

21:20.760 --> 21:23.149
Must be something wrong
with the Machmeter.

21:23.240 --> 21:24.992
Jumped plumb off the scale.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.232
Gone screwy on me.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.630
You bust it, we'll fix it.

21:29.840 --> 21:32.229
Personally, I think you're seeing things.

21:34.760 --> 21:38.275
Could be. I'm still going upstairs
like a bat out of hell.

21:42.920 --> 21:44.194
We did it!

21:44.840 --> 21:47.149
We finally broke the sound barrier.

21:47.720 --> 21:48.994
We did it!

22:25.280 --> 22:28.078
I want to place a long-distance call
to Los Angeles.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.513
Who are you calling?

22:29.600 --> 22:30.635
The press!

22:30.720 --> 22:34.076
This is big news.
The sound barrier's been broken.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.832
No, sir. No press.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.720
No word of this goes beyond the flight line.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.555
What's going on? This is big news.
We need coverage of this.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.471
No, sir. Sorry, no press.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.949
Those are orders. National security.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.473
But the war's over!

22:48.800 --> 22:51.837
Look, pal, maybe they don't want
someone to know.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.309
Who?

22:53.520 --> 22:54.953
The Russians, maybe.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.190
But they're our allies!

22:57.520 --> 23:02.310
Well, anyway, someone figured it out
that way, and that's the way it is.

23:03.440 --> 23:04.953
Chuck, you're our man!

23:05.840 --> 23:07.478
You're the fastest man alive!

23:07.560 --> 23:09.391
We want you to fly more planes for us.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.914
We want you to fly all our planes!

23:12.560 --> 23:14.949
What you been doing, hedgehopping?

23:53.680 --> 23:55.318
Word will get out, Major.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.994
Maybe not to the press
or the general public.

23:58.320 --> 24:02.393
But soon, every fighter jock, rocket ace,
and rat-racer in the country...

24:02.480 --> 24:06.951
...will be headed this way, wanting
to push the outside of the envelope...

24:07.440 --> 24:10.318
...and get to the top of the pyramid.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.750
Edwards Air Force Base.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.717
This is the place to be, hon.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.150
They're going faster, farther
and higher here than anywhere else.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.630
I'll tell you something else, too.

24:50.800 --> 24:55.237
We'll climb right up that ladder,
just like we did at Langley.

24:56.080 --> 24:57.035
We?

24:58.160 --> 24:59.434
You mean you.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.992
Hon, we're a team!

25:02.320 --> 25:04.276
I move up, you move up.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.990
Right to the top of the old pyramid.

25:08.720 --> 25:09.914
Slow down, Gordo.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.275
Come on now, you're scaring the girls.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.437
You're scaring the girls. You are!

25:20.560 --> 25:22.949
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

25:24.880 --> 25:26.950
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

25:33.200 --> 25:35.111
You're looking at him, baby.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.712
Come on, cheer up.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.034
Hey, have I ever let you down?

28:34.360 --> 28:37.158
Deke, that's 62 men...

28:37.600 --> 28:39.477
...in the last 36 weeks.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.911
You know what that averages?

28:46.320 --> 28:48.754
Is that Gus Grissom from Langley Field?

28:50.040 --> 28:52.918
What is an ace like you
doing in a place like this?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.070
Well, if it ain't Hot Dog.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.154
Gordo...

28:58.080 --> 28:59.672
-...Cooper, right?
-Yeah.

29:00.440 --> 29:04.274
Gordo thinks he's one of those
hot-dog pilots you hear so much about.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.352
You got a short memory.

29:06.520 --> 29:10.798
I am not one of them hot-dog pilots.
I am the Hot Dog Man himself.

29:11.240 --> 29:15.119
I guess you're too shy to tell this guy
how I used to wax your tail.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.954
Wax my tail?

29:20.720 --> 29:22.950
Hot Dog, you were just in my shadow.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.671
That's where you'll always be.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.229
What are you two rookies going to have?

29:29.360 --> 29:30.315
Rookies?

29:32.560 --> 29:34.471
Now hold on, sis.

29:35.280 --> 29:38.397
You are looking
at a whole new ballgame here now.

29:39.800 --> 29:42.598
In a few years I bet you're even
going to immortalize us...

29:42.680 --> 29:45.433
...by putting our pictures up there
on your wall.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.190
Did I say something wrong?

29:53.640 --> 29:57.030
I'll tell you. We got two categories
of pilots around here.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.717
We got your prime pilots
that get all the hot planes.

30:00.840 --> 30:04.719
And we got your pudknockers
who dream about getting the hot planes.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.832
Now what are you two pudknockers
going to have?

30:13.840 --> 30:15.114
Scotch.

30:17.040 --> 30:19.759
You know what happened!
The machine broke.

30:19.840 --> 30:21.034
Not the machine, it's the man.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.396
He was dead before he went up.
Don't talk about it here.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.630
Good one. Now fire it in here.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.599
Look at old Yeager.

30:50.320 --> 30:53.517
On top of the pyramid
for five goddamn years.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.197
Every time somebody goes faster,
he just goes up again.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.550
He stays the fastest man alive.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.074
You know...

31:07.680 --> 31:08.908
...sometimes...

31:09.760 --> 31:12.877
...all it takes is just the sound
of a truck starting.

31:14.440 --> 31:15.475
I think:

31:16.240 --> 31:17.878
"That's the crash truck."

31:24.400 --> 31:25.389
Anyway...

31:26.160 --> 31:28.230
...I'm really glad we could talk.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.872
I thought I was the only one
who had these nightmares.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.549
Yeah, me too.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.631
Nobody ever wants to talk
about anything around here.

31:38.960 --> 31:40.871
Everybody's always trying to...

31:42.160 --> 31:44.879
..."maintain an even strain."

31:46.480 --> 31:50.758
Well, you marry a fighter jock
and you marry the military.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.832
I'll tell you one thing.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.880
The military owes me for all this.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.754
One day I expect the military
to make good.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.597
Well, it sure ain't your average dull life.

32:09.040 --> 32:10.837
I went East for a reunion...

32:10.920 --> 32:14.151
...and all my friends could talk about
was their husbands' work.

32:14.240 --> 32:18.472
How dog-eat-dog and cutthroat it was
on Madison Avenue...

32:19.400 --> 32:20.879
...places like that.

32:23.920 --> 32:25.512
Cutthroat?

32:27.280 --> 32:29.840
I wondered how they would have felt...

32:30.800 --> 32:33.837
...if each time their husband
went in to make a deal...

32:34.160 --> 32:37.948
...there was a one in four chance
he wouldn't come out of the meeting.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.479
I'm going home to my folks in San Diego.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.033
What did Gordo say?

32:51.160 --> 32:53.549
He "maintained an even strain."

32:59.160 --> 33:00.309
Look at them.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.348
You'd think they were talking about sports.

33:11.160 --> 33:12.115
Men....

33:13.440 --> 33:16.432
Sometimes they're just such...assholes.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.753
Sometimes they sure are
handy assholes, though.

33:32.440 --> 33:33.839
Yeah, sometimes....

33:36.040 --> 33:37.393
Sometimes.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.433
You want a hot dog?

33:49.560 --> 33:51.471
I'm leaving, Gordo.

33:57.720 --> 33:58.994
Look at that!

33:59.480 --> 34:02.040
Yeah, that's the D-558 Phase 2.

34:02.360 --> 34:03.873
Scott Crossfield.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.520
It sure as hell is. Jesus!

34:09.719 --> 34:11.710
He scorched that one, didn't he?

34:15.159 --> 34:17.310
He's pushing the outside of the envelope.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.311
He must be going for a record.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.469
He's shooting for Mach 2, I heard.

34:24.320 --> 34:28.313
On the 50th anniversary
of the Wright Brothers' historic flight...

34:28.719 --> 34:32.076
...another historic flight takes place,
as Scott Crossfield...

34:32.360 --> 34:36.148
...streaks across the skies
over the high desert in California.

34:36.440 --> 34:37.554
Mach 2.

34:37.639 --> 34:40.473
Almost 1,500 miles per hour...

34:40.600 --> 34:42.830
...and a new world record!

34:43.159 --> 34:45.230
It's a field day for the press.

34:45.560 --> 34:47.949
Congratulations come
from a previous record holder...

34:48.040 --> 34:52.511
...as he shakes the hand
of the fastest man alive, Scott Crossfield.

34:52.880 --> 34:55.792
And there's a comradeship of speed.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.918
To Scott Crossfield, the fastest man alive.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.630
Compliments of Pancho's, Scotty.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.431
The real test wasn't Mach 2.

35:24.760 --> 35:28.799
I guess that demon lives out
at about 2.3 on your Machmeter.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.275
Yeah, but Mach 2 was the magic number.

35:32.760 --> 35:37.038
Like 60 homers, like batting .400,
like the four-minute mile.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.796
The press likes a nice round number.

35:39.960 --> 35:43.077
After that, they don't care,
until the next magic number.

35:43.160 --> 35:46.675
You need more than speed records.
You need coverage.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.114
Coverage?

35:48.440 --> 35:51.955
You mean them root weevils
that crawl around popping off cameras?

35:52.120 --> 35:54.190
Those root weevils write history.

35:54.440 --> 35:58.149
Let them write the history,
and let the pilots fly the planes.

35:59.800 --> 36:00.915
Pilots.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.994
You know what really makes
your rocket ships go up?

36:27.080 --> 36:30.516
The aerodynamics would take
so long to explain to you that--

36:30.680 --> 36:31.669
Funding.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.751
That's what makes your ships go up.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.432
I'll tell you something.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.513
And you guys, too.

36:38.080 --> 36:40.548
No bucks, no Buck Rogers.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.754
Whoever gets the funding
gets the technology.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.673
Whoever gets the technology stays on top.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.398
Flyboy, let's dance.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.673
I'll drink to that.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.553
He'll be going after Crossfield soon,
won't he?

37:24.960 --> 37:26.154
No, he won't.

37:26.320 --> 37:29.517
He'll be going after that demon
that lives in the thin air.

38:08.400 --> 38:09.833
You got any Beemans?

38:10.160 --> 38:13.630
Even before you hit Mach 2,
she'll be unforgiving on you.

38:13.840 --> 38:16.559
So take it easy.
Wring her out a little bit this time.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.675
You got any gum?

38:17.760 --> 38:18.909
Yeah, I got me a stick.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.309
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

38:21.760 --> 38:23.352
-Fair enough.
-Thank you.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.833
Okay, drop her.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.150
All right, here we go again.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.116
Drop!

38:57.280 --> 38:58.918
Number 3 coming on.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.360
Got seven seconds on 150 right now.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.117
I've got you in sight, Chuck.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.273
Going out of sight...

39:32.880 --> 39:33.835
...now!

39:40.360 --> 39:41.634
Mach 1.

39:51.720 --> 39:52.755
Number 4.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.073
Here goes Mach 2.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.675
2. 1.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.194
Sorry, Scotty.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.153
You got her now, buddy.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.753
You can ease it back.

40:07.720 --> 40:08.994
Bring it on in.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.798
I'm pushing the envelope.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.838
See where that demon lives.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.311
Come in, Chuck.

40:37.280 --> 40:38.679
Say again. Over.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.557
Do you read? Over.

40:42.920 --> 40:45.480
Damn! He's uncorked it!

40:46.240 --> 40:47.559
Mayday! Mayday!

40:47.720 --> 40:49.472
Alert all ground crews.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.552
Talk to me!

41:02.120 --> 41:03.075
Come in!

41:05.720 --> 41:07.631
Do you read me? Over.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.518
I'm fighting bad here.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.317
I'm down to 25,000 over Tehachapi.

41:28.840 --> 41:31.638
I don't know if I can make it
back to base or not.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.114
What happened?

41:34.240 --> 41:36.834
Think I bust the canopy with my head.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.673
I'm getting okay now.

41:41.320 --> 41:44.198
We sure chased that old demon this time.

41:45.160 --> 41:47.116
That's as fast as a man can go.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.592
What's next, Ridley?

42:28.880 --> 42:30.074
It's called Sputnik.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.037
We know. Sit down.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.551
And as I was saying...

42:40.280 --> 42:43.795
...whoever controls
the high ground of space...

42:44.280 --> 42:45.998
...will control the world.

42:46.720 --> 42:50.679
The Roman Empire controlled
the world because it could build roads.

42:51.040 --> 42:54.669
Later, the British Empire was dominant
because it had ships.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.749
In the air stage, we were powerful
because we had the airplane.

43:01.200 --> 43:04.556
Now the Communists have established
a foothold in outer space.

43:05.080 --> 43:08.470
Soon they'll have space platforms
to drop nuclear bombs on us...

43:08.560 --> 43:10.790
...like rocks from a highway overpass.

43:11.280 --> 43:14.158
How the hell did they get ahead of us?

43:14.280 --> 43:16.236
Gentlemen, I think we're ready.

43:21.600 --> 43:24.068
Is there a loose plug over there anywhere?

43:26.720 --> 43:28.358
Here it is. I'll get it.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.120
Senator Johnson's right.
This is Armageddon.

43:31.440 --> 43:34.238
The decisive battle between
the forces of good and evil.

43:34.320 --> 43:37.039
We're engaged in a struggle for survival.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.555
This footage was assembled from...

43:41.800 --> 43:44.712
...sources operating under deep cover
at great risk.

43:45.800 --> 43:49.076
We're fortunate this material
did not perish with a couple of men.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.277
This is secret footage
of the Russian Korabl rocket...

43:52.360 --> 43:56.069
...and these are the German scientists
that they captured after the war.

43:56.160 --> 43:59.197
Was it their German scientists
who got them up there first?

44:01.000 --> 44:02.638
No, it was not, Senator.

44:02.720 --> 44:05.393
Our Germans are better
than their Germans.

44:05.920 --> 44:08.912
That's Titov on the right
and on the left is Gagarin.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.759
No, Titov's on the left.
Gagarin's on the right.

44:13.480 --> 44:15.869
They bear a great resemblance
to each other.

44:15.960 --> 44:20.397
If the Soviets ever do put a man up there,
it will be one of these two.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.471
Most likely, the one on the left.

44:22.560 --> 44:23.834
-Gagarin.
-Titov.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.873
Isn't that their chief designer?

44:26.960 --> 44:28.473
We know very little about him.

44:28.560 --> 44:31.028
-Let us see him again.
-Here's some more of him.

44:31.120 --> 44:34.078
They've developed a program
of stupendous dimensions...

44:34.160 --> 44:36.628
...and he is clearly the genius behind it.

44:38.560 --> 44:41.028
I, for one, do not intend to go to sleep...

44:41.360 --> 44:43.590
...by the light of a Communist moon.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.270
Get that moron off of there!

44:53.200 --> 44:55.919
We could have orbited
a satellite a year ago...

44:56.000 --> 44:58.036
...if we had been given a green light.

44:58.120 --> 45:01.715
Now we must get something up there
quick and dirty, any way at all.

45:01.840 --> 45:02.955
Well, what?

45:03.280 --> 45:07.034
By combining our available rockets,
the Redstone, the Atlas...

45:07.320 --> 45:09.629
...I agree that we could launch a pod.

45:10.560 --> 45:11.629
A pot?

45:11.760 --> 45:12.715
A pod.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.474
A capsule.

45:14.560 --> 45:17.120
Now, we will be in full control of this pod.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.475
It will go up like a cannonball...

45:19.560 --> 45:21.994
...and come down like a cannonball...

45:22.320 --> 45:24.709
...splashing down in the ocean...

45:24.920 --> 45:28.276
...with a parachute to spare the life
of the specimen inside.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.474
Spaceman?

45:30.800 --> 45:31.949
Specimen.

45:34.120 --> 45:36.236
Well, what kind of "specimen"?

45:37.720 --> 45:38.789
A tough one.

45:39.920 --> 45:41.558
Responsive to orders.

45:42.920 --> 45:44.558
I had in mind a jimp.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.075
"Jimp"?

45:46.320 --> 45:48.197
Well, what the hell is a "jimp"?

45:48.560 --> 45:51.836
A jimp. A jimpanzee, Senator. An ape.

45:52.480 --> 45:56.155
The first American into space
is not going to be a chimpanzee.

45:57.640 --> 46:00.393
Who would you put into space,
Mr. President?

46:00.520 --> 46:04.308
We have film of some people
we think are strong candidates.

46:04.400 --> 46:07.437
We'd like to run it by you
and stimulate some thinking.

46:08.880 --> 46:12.555
These are people we felt
would be excellent in the splashdown.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.557
We like the one on the right.

46:14.640 --> 46:17.916
-No, on the left.
-On the right. Don't embarrass me!

46:18.000 --> 46:22.357
These people are very experienced with
machinery and have their own helmets.

46:22.640 --> 46:23.868
Is that a factor?

46:23.960 --> 46:25.359
As you'll see...

46:25.760 --> 46:28.672
...they're quite comfortable
in conditions of flame.

46:29.640 --> 46:33.792
Now this is personnel who have
very well-developed equilibrium.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.868
Good middle ear. Also very nice people.

46:37.960 --> 46:39.188
Very easy to work with.

46:39.280 --> 46:42.192
With some work,
they could be very responsive to orders.

46:42.280 --> 46:45.033
This is my first choice.
The man with the hood.

46:45.160 --> 46:49.631
Since he works without eyesight,
his other senses are sharpened.

46:49.800 --> 46:53.031
In space there'll be little need
for eyeballing at any rate.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.714
The cannonball effect you mentioned....

46:56.000 --> 46:58.673
We were basically thinking about...

46:58.760 --> 47:00.716
...putting a couple into orbit.

47:00.960 --> 47:03.076
Possibly adds emotional stability.

47:03.720 --> 47:06.996
This individual combines many
plus factors that we mentioned.

47:07.080 --> 47:10.993
Ease with flames, comfort at heights
and agility in the splashdown phase.

47:11.080 --> 47:13.355
Also, he is available as of the 15th.

47:15.640 --> 47:17.437
I want test pilots!

47:18.080 --> 47:20.196
Test pilots? No, you can't deal with them.

47:20.280 --> 47:23.317
I'm sure we can do better
with another type of man...

47:23.520 --> 47:25.192
...any other type of man.

47:25.440 --> 47:27.078
A more manageable type.

47:27.200 --> 47:29.111
It will only complicate things.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.634
With a man we must guarantee
a safe return.

47:31.720 --> 47:34.598
Mr. President, I think
you'd be wise to reconsider.

47:36.360 --> 47:37.509
Test pilots?

47:37.640 --> 47:39.312
We'll be heading for some air bases.

47:39.400 --> 47:40.992
Not just some air bases.

47:41.200 --> 47:44.510
The one with the great test pilots.
There's only one place to go.

47:45.760 --> 47:49.150
I was there once before
and I hoped I'd never have to go back.

47:49.720 --> 47:53.952
It's a god-forsaken spot on the roof
of the high desert in California.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.796
A prehistoric throwback
of an airfield called Edwards.

47:58.120 --> 48:00.680
They've got a weird, mad-monk squadron.

48:01.080 --> 48:03.640
They live in rat shacks, terrible conditions.

48:03.720 --> 48:06.917
Corrugated tin, bare bones, low rent.

48:07.640 --> 48:09.551
This is the joint they hang out in.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.710
Pancho's Happy Bottom Riding Club.

48:12.040 --> 48:14.270
It's called Happy Bottom Riding Club?

48:14.600 --> 48:16.511
How'd it get a name like that?

48:16.960 --> 48:18.279
Ask Pancho.

48:21.320 --> 48:24.630
We're meeting the Liaison Officer.
They are expecting us.

48:24.720 --> 48:26.278
They? Who's "they"?

48:26.480 --> 48:27.629
The best--

48:30.280 --> 48:32.350
The best test pilots in the world.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.470
They got some kind of brotherhood.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.670
They think they got the right stuff.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.830
What stuff? Heroism, bravery?

48:41.160 --> 48:42.991
There any snakes around here?

48:43.080 --> 48:44.593
Yeah. In the bushes.

48:44.880 --> 48:48.668
Heroism and bravery are part of it.
But seems to be more to it.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.673
What do they say it means?

48:50.760 --> 48:53.638
They don't say anything.
They don't talk about it.

48:53.720 --> 48:55.870
They don't talk about it to outsiders?

48:56.080 --> 48:57.399
To each other.

48:57.480 --> 48:59.471
To outsiders they say even less.

49:00.680 --> 49:02.318
Anyway, they're all here.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.916
Including the ace of aces himself.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.115
Who's that?

49:07.080 --> 49:08.069
Yeager.

49:08.560 --> 49:09.959
Never heard of him.

49:23.480 --> 49:26.153
These must be our gentlemen
from Washington...

49:26.440 --> 49:28.192
...scouting for astronauts.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.309
Scouting for lab rabbits, more likely.

49:34.120 --> 49:35.712
I didn't quite hear you.

49:38.080 --> 49:39.718
I said, "Lab rabbits."

49:40.920 --> 49:42.035
What's that mean?

49:42.120 --> 49:44.839
It means you don't need
honest-to-God pilots.

49:45.320 --> 49:49.154
What you ought to get is a lab rabbit
to curl up in your damn capsule...

49:49.600 --> 49:51.431
...with its heart beating...

49:51.680 --> 49:53.318
...and a wire up the kazoo.

49:55.760 --> 49:56.954
I don't hold with it.

49:57.040 --> 49:58.314
I don't either.

49:58.720 --> 50:01.234
You want a pilot to be a ballistic missile.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.953
And then splashdown.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.311
Possibly get lost at sea.

50:05.440 --> 50:07.670
There's some things you can't change.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.629
Some peckerwood's
got to take the beast up.

50:10.720 --> 50:13.917
And some peckerwood's got to land it.

50:14.400 --> 50:17.756
And that peckerwood is called a pilot.

50:18.400 --> 50:19.879
You're mighty right.

50:20.080 --> 50:22.548
The boys smell panic in your program.

50:22.720 --> 50:24.915
That's one thing they don't respond to.

50:25.000 --> 50:29.198
Now maybe if we talk privately
to Yeager and some of the other boys--

50:29.280 --> 50:30.474
That's Yeager?

50:30.560 --> 50:33.757
Anybody goes up in the damn thing's
gonna be Spam in a can.

50:39.280 --> 50:41.236
Yeager doesn't fit the profile.

50:42.200 --> 50:45.590
He didn't go to college.
We're only taking college personnel.

50:46.240 --> 50:50.711
Forget about Walker and Crossfield
and the other civilian pilots, too.

50:52.920 --> 50:56.276
The security clearance just takes
too long with those people.

50:56.640 --> 50:59.359
Besides, they seem
a little too independent.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.155
You mean for this space race...

51:03.800 --> 51:05.836
...you don't want our best pilots?

51:06.240 --> 51:07.673
I didn't say that.

51:08.160 --> 51:11.357
We want the best pilots that we can get.

51:14.120 --> 51:15.712
Y'all want some whiskey?

51:16.200 --> 51:18.555
No, thanks, Fred. Just a little coffee.

51:18.960 --> 51:20.632
I'd like a Coca-Cola.

51:21.480 --> 51:22.833
In a clean glass.

51:23.280 --> 51:26.511
There's an old saying:
"Never refuse a combat assignment."

51:29.120 --> 51:33.750
Well, there sure is a long line
of shit-hot rocket aces around here.

51:35.240 --> 51:36.389
Hey, Hot Dog.

51:37.600 --> 51:39.989
What the hell's "astronaut" mean anyway?

51:43.200 --> 51:44.474
Star voyager.

51:48.960 --> 51:50.871
Star voyager Gus Grissom.

51:53.280 --> 51:55.032
I like the sound of that.

51:56.440 --> 51:57.589
Now your name is?

51:57.920 --> 51:59.672
My name, José Jiménez.

52:02.240 --> 52:04.959
Who are we gonna get
to take on the Russians?

52:05.440 --> 52:08.955
Have you seen this José Jiménez?
He's a crack-up.

52:10.880 --> 52:14.714
I am the chief astronaut
of the United States Interplanetary....

52:21.440 --> 52:23.351
My name, José Jiménez.

52:24.280 --> 52:27.431
Now I see you have some of
your space equipment with you.

52:27.720 --> 52:30.075
What is that called? The crash helmet?

52:30.400 --> 52:31.992
Oh, I hope not.

52:32.360 --> 52:33.679
Get that guy off.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.350
The country's already laughing at us.

52:39.360 --> 52:41.032
This is the show I wanted you to see.

52:41.120 --> 52:42.394
Who, that kid?

52:45.480 --> 52:47.755
Winner of five
Distinguished Flying Crosses...

52:47.840 --> 52:52.311
...and holder of the coast-to-coast,
nonstop, supersonic flight record...

52:52.640 --> 52:54.631
...from the U.S. Marine Corps...

52:55.040 --> 52:56.359
...Major John Glenn!

52:56.440 --> 52:57.429
That guy.

53:01.600 --> 53:03.875
Can you tell us what's that song?

53:06.080 --> 53:07.991
Straighten Up and Fly Right.

53:16.640 --> 53:18.756
It's Straighten Up and Fly Right.

53:19.520 --> 53:20.714
He's not dumb.

53:27.640 --> 53:31.633
Major, Eddie here has a little problem
with his girlfriend.

53:32.120 --> 53:35.157
Did you ever have a problem like that
when you were ten?

53:35.560 --> 53:37.073
Yes, I did, Bob.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.910
I liked a girl in my class, but...

53:40.280 --> 53:43.158
...the other guys liked her too
and she didn't pay attention.

53:43.240 --> 53:45.390
But I kept after her, Eddie.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.675
Did you finally get her to notice you?

53:48.760 --> 53:49.875
Yes, I did.

53:50.200 --> 53:52.509
In fact, I finally got her to marry me.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.633
They love the guy.

54:15.200 --> 54:17.555
Delta Charlie 9, you are clear to land...

54:17.640 --> 54:19.198
...at 180 degrees.

54:19.800 --> 54:22.473
José Jiménez on approach.

54:24.920 --> 54:27.309
My name, José Jiménez.

54:27.640 --> 54:32.031
Yeah, Shepard, I forgot.
You are clear at 180 degrees.

54:32.360 --> 54:35.875
Some boys here want to talk to you
about being an astronaut.

54:36.120 --> 54:39.476
They want to make me an astronaut?
Oh, I hope not.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.436
Are you sure the Navy's got good pilots?

54:55.720 --> 54:59.633
They call them aviators in the Navy.
They say they're better than pilots.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.560
Gentlemen, I'd like you
to meet Alan Shepard.

55:15.160 --> 55:17.390
I'd like you to meet Alan Shepard.

55:17.560 --> 55:19.391
Just the man we came to see.

55:26.080 --> 55:28.036
You've heard about our project.

55:28.120 --> 55:31.317
We're going up against the Russians.
It's got the highest....

55:31.640 --> 55:32.755
Priority.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.513
It's a hazardous...

55:35.000 --> 55:37.878
...undertaking. In fact,
it's extremely hazardous.

55:39.200 --> 55:43.671
It's so hazardous that
if you decide not to volunteer...

55:43.880 --> 55:46.440
...it will not be held against you
in any way.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.478
-Sounds dangerous.
-It is.

55:49.560 --> 55:50.993
Count me in.

55:54.320 --> 55:57.073
There's nothing to worry about.
Absolutely nothing.

56:04.760 --> 56:07.035
Why are you doing this to me?

56:07.640 --> 56:10.837
I'm afraid there's no simple way
to explain that to you.

56:33.720 --> 56:35.790
Thank you, Number 21.

56:48.240 --> 56:50.629
Number 22, please.

56:52.160 --> 56:53.752
You're gonna love it.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.231
Excuse me, are you John Glenn?

57:06.120 --> 57:07.553
Scott Carpenter.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.959
I recognize you from those TV shows.
I like them.

57:11.120 --> 57:12.951
I had a good time doing them.

57:13.040 --> 57:15.918
I guess we're both here
for the same reason.

57:17.880 --> 57:19.950
You know what they've got planned?

57:20.440 --> 57:22.112
No. Let me check it out.

57:22.520 --> 57:24.351
What have you got scheduled?

57:24.480 --> 57:27.472
We're not really free
to reveal all the testing.

57:31.720 --> 57:32.948
I don't get this.

57:33.040 --> 57:35.952
Sending us down here
disguised as civilians.

57:36.200 --> 57:38.760
Come on, Gus, cut it out. What the hell...?

57:38.840 --> 57:42.037
Hot Dog, this entire operation's
supposed to be hush-hush.

57:42.640 --> 57:47.111
We got top-secret orders to blend in
with the patients. So shut up.

57:49.960 --> 57:52.030
There might be Russian agents here.

57:55.440 --> 57:57.829
They don't look very Russian to me, Gus.

57:58.280 --> 58:00.999
All we got here is your local gentry, and...

58:01.840 --> 58:05.435
...then you got Navy
and Marine pilots over here.

58:05.640 --> 58:08.359
None of these guys is up
to Air Force standards.

58:09.160 --> 58:12.994
I hear they got some 50-some guys
trying out for seven spots.

58:13.560 --> 58:16.757
After they pick us three,
there's only gonna be four spots.

58:17.120 --> 58:19.680
Sounds right to me. Where do we go next?

58:19.760 --> 58:21.398
You go in that door.

58:25.360 --> 58:26.679
Who are you?

58:33.080 --> 58:35.878
My name, José Jiménez.

58:39.240 --> 58:40.878
You talking to us, buddy?

58:41.920 --> 58:45.515
All Air Force pilots go in that door.

58:46.640 --> 58:48.153
When they all go in...

58:49.320 --> 58:51.038
...they all look the same.

58:51.480 --> 58:53.596
But when they all come out...

58:54.640 --> 58:56.358
...they all look different.

58:57.040 --> 58:58.109
How's that?

59:00.040 --> 59:01.758
Fellow, I said how's that?

59:03.240 --> 59:05.037
When they all come out...

59:06.440 --> 59:08.271
...they all look scared.

59:18.200 --> 59:19.599
Buenos días, González.

59:21.120 --> 59:22.633
Buenos días yourself.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.592
Would you come this way.

59:30.440 --> 59:32.476
That guy didn't fool me a bit.

59:32.880 --> 59:34.233
That Mexican guy?

59:34.520 --> 59:37.717
That guy's Navy all the way.
There's another swabbo.

59:38.320 --> 59:40.788
I'll open the box a little so you can see.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.513
Don't put your fingers in there.

59:42.600 --> 59:45.160
This thing will bite them off. It's vicious.

59:48.960 --> 59:50.916
Real swabbo sense of humor.

59:53.160 --> 59:56.152
Let's see what there is
to be scared about back here.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.159
The ball must be maintained
in the position between these two lines.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.838
You may begin...now.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.071
The record is 91 seconds.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.638
Ninety-three seconds. Read it and weep.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.318
Terrific, Scott. Darn good!

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.834
You were probably just getting warmed up.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.151
Next time I doubt I'd win.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.719
I don't know about that.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.189
We're competing with Archie and Jughead.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.309
Let me out of here! Let me out!

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.718
Gus, I got this whole thing figured out.

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:41.873
The drill here....

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:49.078
The drill here is to see who can drill
the brains out of Nurse Murch.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.114
You're nuts.

01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:56.599
She thinks we're all just
miserable pudknockers.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:01.074
This is one fighter jock
who is not a miserable pudknocker.

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.075
She's a woman,
susceptible to charms like all of the rest.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.832
You want what in there?

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.155
Sperm.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.195
What for?

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.796
Sperm motility factors.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:23.555
Yeah, but, Nurse...

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.031
...how am I supposed to....

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:32.114
The best results seem to be obtained
through fantasization...

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.795
...accompanied by masturbation,
followed by ejaculation.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.638
That sounds easy enough.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.759
I'll tell you what.

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.153
If I get stuck, you mind coming in
and helping me out a little bit?

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.470
Please return it to the lab.

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.390
Hey, cut out the humming in there.

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.550
Okay, knock it off in there.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:01.078
Okay, Glenn, I know that's you.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.070
Just knock it off,
because I'm trying to concentrate in here.

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.914
That was quick.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.635
There's plenty more where that came from.

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.392
You want to see me again?

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.672
I'd like to meet your wife.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.592
You're married, aren't you?

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.036
Yeah, sure, I'm married all right.

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.955
Happily?

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.397
Yeah. A real stable relationship, too.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.758
I'd like to meet your wife.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.395
Tomorrow.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:17.959
Tomorrow's no good.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.274
Tomorrow.

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.712
I need you, Trudy.

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:41.158
I'm talking about a whole new ball game.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.319
Fresh start.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.389
This astronaut thing is the best way
for us to move up that ladder.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.434
If we play our cards right,
we go all the way to the top.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:54.953
We? You mean you.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:57.674
I mean we.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.359
We're a team.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.238
Have I ever let you down?

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.475
Yeah.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.156
Who's the best pilot you ever saw?

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.992
You're looking at him.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:56.711
You're all set. I told her you were stable,
well-adjusted, attentive, persevering.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.158
-I lied.
-That a girl.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.274
What'd she say?

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:02.554
She laughed.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.871
She knows you too well, Gordo.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:08.556
Let's face it. Some women
just have a problem with men.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.758
Yeah, I know.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.950
At secret locations throughout America...

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:22.759
...56 of our greatest pilots
are at this moment...

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.435
...vying to be one of the first men
to go into space.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.640
These are the most up-to-date
tests imaginable.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.395
This is the most rigorous physical testing
ever done to human beings.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:40.551
They're being subjected to every stress
our doctors and engineers can invent.

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.234
These men are preparing themselves
for the ordeal of capsule life.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:53.192
They will be guiding a new machine
through a hostile environment.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.477
They will be faced with emergencies
no man can foresee.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.913
Many are called, but few will be chosen.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.875
These are men who will have to face
any danger for their country.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.717
No individual will have ever been
so adequately prepared for an event.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.836
Each man knows
that whoever survives this competition...

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.357
...is destined to become
a legend in his own time.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.874
Here, hold this.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.272
And hold this like this.

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:40.672
When the clamp is released,
the balloon inside you deflates.

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.352
Deflates? Where's the john?

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.274
Two floors up. González will take
you there, but wait here with him.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:54.078
How's it going, González?

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:27.508
Faster!

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.439
Good day, Commander.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.476
You prick!

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.314
Push the button.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.071
Me and my friends think your
José Jiménez imitation is A-okay.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.916
But what you're doing with it is b-a-d.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.309
You're right, you're absolutely right.

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:49.953
You ever have any explosions doing this?

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.471
All the time. It's a mess.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.520
Tell me something else, Mr. González.

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.559
How am I doing?

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.509
I think you're gonna make it.
I think you're gonna be an astronaut.

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.353
After a long...

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.040
...and unprecedented
series of evaluations...

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.279
...which told our medical scientists...

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:42.596
...of their superb adaptability
to their upcoming flight...

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:46.920
...it is my pleasure to introduce to you...

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.632
...seven Americans...

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.113
...gentlemen all.

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:56.520
Virgil I. ''Gus'' Grissom!

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.110
Leroy G. Cooper!

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.115
Donald K. Slayton!

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.028
John H. Glenn, Junior!

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:13.470
Malcolm S. Carpenter!

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.999
Alan B. Shepard, Junior!

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:20.677
Walter M. Schirra, Junior!

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.431
America's Mercury astronauts!

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.673
Holy shit!

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.710
Smile, Gus. We're heroes.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.198
Yeager ought to see this.

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.557
Seven rookies being installed
as the hottest fliers...

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.389
...and they haven't done a thing
but show up for a press conference.

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:07.392
Following the distribution of the kits,
those of you who have p.m. deadlines...

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.631
...better dash to your phones.

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.158
Now we'll have some questions
from the press, please.

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.033
I'd like to know
whether your wives and children...

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.190
...had anything to say about this.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.793
Mine think it's fine.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.599
They're all for it.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.110
I don't think any of us could go on
with something like this...

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:00.033
...if we didn't have
pretty good backing at home.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:08.313
My wife's attitude towards this
has been the same...

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.914
...as it's been all along through my flying.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.352
If it's what I want to do, she's behind it.

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:17.512
And, by golly, my kids are, too.
100 percent.

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.272
I don't believe this.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:30.638
But look at them out there.
They're eating it up.

01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.872
I was brought up believing
that you are placed on earth...

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.997
...more or less with a 50-50 proposition.

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.951
This is what I still believe.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:47.230
We're placed here with certain talents
and capabilities...

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:51.393
...and it's up to each one of us
to use those talents as best we can.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.029
And if we use our talents properly...

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:01.548
...I think there is a power
greater than us that will place...

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.796
...the opportunities in our way.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.113
When I think of Orville and Wilbur Wright...

01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:15.754
...standing on a hill
at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina...

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.833
...tossing a coin to see which one
would take the first airplane flight...

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.828
...and then I think of us here today...

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:30.756
...I thank God I live in a country...

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.991
...where the best and finest in a man
can be brought out.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.389
I'd like to second some of the things
Mr. Glenn has said here.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.553
I think that we are all very,
very fortunate...

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.478
...that we have been,
should we say, ''blessed''...

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.360
...with the talents for something like this.

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:06.594
And I think that we would be most remiss
in our duty indeed...

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.669
...if we did not volunteer
for something as important as this is...

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.433
...for our country...

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.114
...and to the world in general right now.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.358
One of our Air Force boys.

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.512
Don't you agree, Deke?

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:27.791
I absolutely agree with Gordo.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.510
But we're not saying anything new.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:33.394
We're just saying the same things...

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:37.598
...that need to be said again
and again with fierce conviction.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.718
Can you tell us if any of you
go to church regularly?

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.996
As far as church goes...

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.393
...I attend regularly.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.080
Which one of you will be
the first into space?

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.110
The best will be first.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.993
Share it, brother.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.518
Fucking A, bubba.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.960
This is for America's Life magazine.

01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:58.316
These are the greatest pilots in America.

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.518
How much do they make?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.991
$7,000-$8,000 a year?

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.275
-Tops.
-At the most.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:10.229
With this one deal
I'm giving them $500,000...

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.749
...split seven ways over three years.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.273
How does that sound?

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:21.118
Now I want them all to meet my people
who will write their true stories.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:24.955
These stories will appear in Life
under their own by-lines.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:26.789
For example...

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.440
"...by Betty Grissom..."

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.274
...or, "by...

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.631
"...Virgil I. Grissom."

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:39.829
What was that?

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:40.909
Gus.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.753
Nobody calls me by that other name.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.829
Gus?

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.835
An astronaut named Gus?

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.593
What's your middle name?

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.669
Ivan.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:00.875
Maybe...

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.473
..."Gus" isn't so bad.

01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.398
Might be something there.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.830
All right, you can be Gus.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.877
I bet for all that money
they could call you Virgil.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:19.792
They sure could me.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.792
Well, what's with her?

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.519
She seems snobby.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.553
I don't get it.

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.838
I get it. She's "Mrs. Clean Marine."

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.471
I'm going to the Cape tomorrow.

01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.080
I wish to heck it wasn't off-limits to wives.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.878
There's so much work to do, anyway.
More tests...

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.029
...training...

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.235
...studying.

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.830
What about after?

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.118
After hours I'll run a lot.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.949
I'm going to get up to five miles a day.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.760
There's a beautiful, long beach there.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.992
It's called Cocoa Beach.

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:29.713
You can run forever.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.836
Scott Carpenter will run with me.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.759
He's a good guy.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.192
He's real philosophical.

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:43.154
What about...?

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:50.191
The others want to get the job done and
keep the Mickey Mouse to a minimum.

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.519
They're good men.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.389
Good men.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.080
They'll give 100 percent
when the time comes.

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.910
Guess they think I'm kind of a...

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.278
...gung-ho type.

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.479
"Eddie Attaboy."

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.793
"Harry Hairshirt."

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.754
What, you agree?

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:27.875
You agree?

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:29.268
My own wife.

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:33.110
Do you think I'm a "Dudley Doright"?

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.639
That's me, I guess.

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:41.596
A lonely beacon of restraint...

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:44.399
...and self-sacrifice
in a squall of car-crazies.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.515
It's important to America
to get a man up there first.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.914
I plan to be the first man
to ride the rocket.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:56.237
What is the most important thing
in rocket travel?

01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.954
To me the most important thing...

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.353
...is the blast-off.

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.515
I always take a blast before I take off.

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.631
Otherwise I wouldn't go near it.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.438
He loves Ed Sullivan.

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.760
Four down, three to go.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:30.671
I don't want anything to put this program
in a bad light.

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:35.832
We have the opportunity of a lifetime
and I'm sorry, but I won't stand by...

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.878
...and let other people compromise
the whole darned thing!

01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:42.555
You know and I know this could lead
to something very unfortunate.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.838
I'm talking about the playing around
that's going on.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.470
I'm talking about the young girls.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.358
I'm talking about the cookies.

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:53.512
I'm talking about keeping our pants zipped
and our wicks dry.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.034
Mr. Glenn, you are way out of line.

01:29:56.680 --> 01:30:01.231
I advise you not to try to foist your
moral views on anyone else in this group.

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.715
Each man here has volunteered to do a job.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.633
Each man is devoting long hours
of training...

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:09.837
...and doing many things above
and beyond the call of duty...

01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.911
...such as morale tours of factories--

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.991
Such as bringing girls up to your room?

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:16.514
And forgoing any orderly family life.

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:19.433
Mr. Glenn, as long
as a man uses good sense...

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:22.318
...what he does with his wick
is his own business!

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:26.279
I'm from Life magazine.
I'm not with these people.

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.432
You can't go in.
They're discussing scientific problems.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:36.712
John's right. Whether we like it or not
we're public figures.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.394
Whether we deserve it or not,
people look up to us.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.710
We have a tremendous responsibility.

01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:44.837
You can't tell a pilot what to do
when he's not flying.

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.711
Wait a minute. You got it all wrong.

01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:53.552
The issue here ain't pussy.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.638
The issue here is monkey.

01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:58.912
Us. We are the monkey.

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:04.679
What Gus is saying is
that we're missing the point.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:08.799
Gus is saying that we all heard rumors
they want to send a monkey up first.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:12.316
None of us wants them to send
a monkey up to do a man's work.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:14.072
What Gus is saying is that...

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.039
...what they're trying to do to us
is send a man up to do a monkey's work.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:20.873
Us. A bunch of
college-trained chimpanzees.

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.670
What Gus is saying is that
we've got to change things around here.

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:26.716
He's saying that we are pilots.

01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.477
We know more about what we need
to fly than anybody else.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:33.200
So what we have to do
is alter the experiment.

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.355
It comes down to who is going
to control this thing from here on.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:41.115
What Gus is saying here is
that we've got to stick together on this.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:48.430
These tests were designed...

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.320
...to decondition, to desensitize...

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.711
...to adapt out fears.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:58.629
Since we have developed
a fully automated vehicle...

01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:01.550
...all we seek from the occupants...

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:03.471
...of the capsule is data.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.634
The so-called astronaut...

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:09.877
...would merely be a redundant component.

01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:14.068
And here you can see...

01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:17.596
...these chimps are capable of many
of the same tasks as men.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.116
And they are much more cooperative.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:27.669
They are being put through every phase
of the astronaut training.

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:31.395
As far as we are concerned,
the question still remains:

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:33.471
Which one will be first?

01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:35.153
The man or...

01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.594
...the monkey?

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.709
We shall see.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.558
Take it easy with that.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:21.279
-Where are you putting the window?
-Window?

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:22.795
There is no window.

01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:23.995
No window?

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.833
What about the hatch?

01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.272
We need a hatch with explosive bolts,
that we can open ourselves.

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.749
There's something you don't understand.

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.149
This is the final form of the capsule.

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:37.435
No hatch.

01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.512
What would happen
if the automatic controls went out?

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.637
With backups, checks,
this would not happen.

01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:46.235
I said, what would happen if it did?

01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:47.998
The pilot would have to fly it back.

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:49.832
This is the way it is.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.117
I wonder how the press will feel about this.

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:57.397
The press? What does the press
have to say about this?

01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.036
Do you boys know
what makes this bird go up?

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:05.035
Funding makes this bird go up.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:07.156
That's right. No bucks...

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.473
...no Buck Rogers.

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.154
And the press over there....

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.476
They all want to see Buck Rogers.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.788
And that's us.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.749
Buck Rogers.

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:28.192
You see, those fellows over there
have been making us out...

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:31.397
...as the seven finest and bravest pilots
in all America.

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:34.914
If the story would come out in the press...

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:38.395
...that we are not allowed to fly as pilots....

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:39.913
We want a window.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:45.031
There could maybe be...

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.232
...in future capsules a window...

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:50.988
...here.

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.913
No, that's where the hatch
with explosive bolts goes.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.956
The hatch with the explosive--

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.596
There could be a hatch
with explosive bolts on the capsule.

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.671
That is a spacecraft, sir.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:07.790
We do not refer to it as a "capsule."

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.314
Spacecraft.

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:16.349
A hatch with explosive bolts on the...

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.194
...spacecraft.

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:24.589
And there will be pitch and yaw thrusters
to enable the occupant--

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.715
The pilot.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.119
Astronaut-pilot?

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:33.634
The astronaut...

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:35.795
...pilot...

01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:38.873
...to have some...

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.714
...to have...

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:45.069
...control...

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.271
...of the re-entry procedures.

01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:55.393
We appreciate it.

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:59.673
You wouldn't mind if we had the press
take a few photos of us, would you?

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:35.913
Which one of you is going to be
the first one to be launched into space?

01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:12.679
Here he is.

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:15.077
Captain Ham.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.560
Grinning like a possum
eating a sweet potato.

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:25.749
Does he look like the kind of guy
who'd put doo-doo in the capsule?

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:27.989
Ham in a can.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.709
America's first astronaut. Look at him!

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:38.396
You take a monkey like this,
you can make him into a great astronaut.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.674
I think he's better looking than Crossfield.

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:48.590
How would you like to go up
with this guy as your copilot?

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.397
They've got a man up there. It's Gagarin.

01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:58.879
We know. Sit down.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.877
All right, give them a break.

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:42.672
Is it true you were ready to go
and the flight was cancelled?

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.910
Is it true we could've beaten the Russians?

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.037
Why didn't we send a man up
instead of a monkey?

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.278
I think we ought to be...

01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:54.597
...forthright, gracious,
and magnanimous and say...

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.309
...the Russians beat the pants off us.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.391
No sense in kidding ourselves about it.

01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:02.517
But the space age has begun,
and there's plenty of work.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:04.750
Who will be the second man in space?

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:08.837
You mean who will be
the first free man into space?

01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.115
We know it'll be Glenn. Just tell us when.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.469
That's a secret.

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:17.957
I'm tired of being "forthright,
gracious, and magnanimous."

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.999
I'm tired of stupid questions
from the press.

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:24.278
I'm tired of smocks,
of engineers telling us what we can't do.

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.828
I'm tired of everybody saying
we are not pilots.

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.512
I'm tired of monkeys.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.197
Most of all, I'm sick and tired
of being second to those...

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:35.400
...those darned Russians. It's time we--

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:36.999
Got someone up there!

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:40.235
Fucking A, bubba.

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.839
-Exactly.
-Let's talk to them.

01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.672
Let's get this thing on the road.

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:45.591
I'm tired of messing around.

01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.438
We'll just tell 'em we're ready.
We're ready to go.

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:28.872
In these three weeks since the Russian
Gagarin's flight surprised everybody...

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.474
...one wretched event
has followed another.

01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:34.353
People have begun to say
our rockets always blow up...

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.510
...our boys always botch it.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:41.674
Some say this is not the time to try
desperate deeds to beat the Soviets.

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:43.108
The question really is:

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.317
Are we actually ready
to launch a man into space?

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:50.195
And yet out here at this very moment
sits a rocket, waiting in the night.

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:53.477
Soon, one American astronaut
will climb atop that rocket...

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:57.155
...in what may be the greatest
death-defying stunt ever broadcast.

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:03.677
The identity of America's first astronaut
has been kept a secret...

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.716
...until almost the final moment.

01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:09.236
The question everyone has asked is:
Which one will be first?

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:39.873
Not very funny, John.

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.270
But I do appreciate it, John.

01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.352
I surely do.

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.630
Vaya con Dios, José.

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.958
Dear Lord, please don't let me fuck up.

01:45:03.280 --> 01:45:05.874
I didn't quite copy that. Say again, please.

01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.196
I said, everything's A-okay.

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.715
Well, that's what I thought you said.

01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.634
He said everything is A-okay.

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:21.229
He says everything is A-okay.
And there you have it.

01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.717
Roger. Auto retro-jettison switch.

01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:37.836
Retro-heater switch...off.

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:41.551
Retro-heater switch...off.

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.429
Landing-bag switch...auto.

01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:48.990
Roger. Landing-bag switch...auto.

01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:52.839
This is it, ladies. This is for Life magazine.

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.312
My God! They're going
after the diaper-service man.

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:08.555
We don't have a diaper-service man.

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.993
Oh, Louise, your lawn!

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:21.273
Why are they here?

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:22.799
What do they want?

01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:25.599
We are here live at the house
of Louise Shepard...

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.116
...wife of Astronaut Al Shepard,
who is about to go into space.

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.915
Wanted to keep you informed,
Mrs. Shepard.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.434
Everything's A-okay.
Nothing to worry about.

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:40.835
Just some delays.

01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.952
What kind of delays?

01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:46.119
There's another hold from NASA,
another delay.

01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:49.318
And Alan Shepard sits there
patiently waiting.

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.677
What can be going through
a man's mind at this moment?

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.719
I have to urinate.

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:03.915
Urinate?

01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:08.394
Urinate? No. We did not think of that.

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.750
This is only a 15-minute flight.

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.990
The man's been up there for hours.

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.718
Could he do it in his suit?

01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:17.360
It might be dangerous.
To introduce liquid...

01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:21.308
...into the pure oxygen of the capsule
and the pressure suit...

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:24.518
...might cause a short circuit.
It could start a fire.

01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:26.272
No. Tell him he cannot.

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:34.433
Listen, old buddy, they promise
we'll stop at the next gas station.

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:38.435
Request that you remain
in a holding pattern till then.

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.232
-You sure you just want a little smidgen?
-About a half a cup.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.311
-And nothing in it?
-That's fine.

01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.475
All right.

01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:01.155
Alan had four cups of coffee
before he went to work this morning.

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.429
All this waiting is driving me crazy.

01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:15.392
I had a little accident.

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.549
Request permission to relieve bladder.

01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:47.709
Look, the man has got to go.

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.996
It's either that or we get the lug wrench
and pry him out.

01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.713
Do it in the suit.

01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:02.716
José, permission granted...

01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.995
...to wet your diapers anytime, son.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:20.037
Suit thermometer says
Freon flow jumping from 30 to 45.

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:22.277
Left lower-chest sensor.

01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:28.670
No shortout. Moving up back.

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:33.715
Well....

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.713
I'm a wetback now.

01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:40.111
It is questionable if we can proceed.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:44.512
I'm cooler than you are. Why don't you
fix your problems and light this candle!

01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:47.229
He's right! Let's light this candle!

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.470
He surely is! Light the candle!

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:52.313
Resume the countdown.

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.713
T minus ten seconds...

01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:04.473
...nine, eight, seven....

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:12.995
Ignition.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.878
You're on your way, José.

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:26.074
We have liftoff, and the clock is operating.

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:37.917
I think we'll be able to talk
to one of the astronaut wives...

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.150
...if not to Louise Shepard herself.

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:09.077
He has re-entered the Earth's atmosphere
and the g-forces should be building up.

01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:11.355
Louise, he's coming down!

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:15.350
We almost missed this.

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:20.955
Eight.

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:23.913
That's nine.

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:26.154
I'm okay!

01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.952
The Vice President,
who is Chairman of our Space Council...

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:20.634
...and who bears great responsibilities
in this field...

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:22.950
...the members of the House and Senate...

01:52:23.040 --> 01:52:26.032
...Space Committee,
who are here today to award you...

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.478
...this decoration,
which has gone from the ground up.

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.952
What was Jackie like?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.274
She's very nice.

01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:00.510
We talked about all kinds of things.

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:02.192
My Gus goes up next.

01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:04.590
I can't wait to talk to Jackie after that.

01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:07.877
You'll love her. She's so nice.
We talked about the kids.

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:27.758
Mr. Shepard, sign here.

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.551
I never realized...

01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:39.671
...a gruff, mean son of a bitch like you
could be so popular.

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.510
How'd you get to go up before me?

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:45.910
Even before "Mr. Clean, the Marine."

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:48.870
Charm, Hot Dog. Pure charm.

01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.034
Watch this.

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.791
Hey, sis, how are you doing?

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:56.552
So-so. How are you doing?

01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:58.473
I ain't doing anymore.

01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:01.597
Damn thing's dragging in the mud,
and I can't get it up.

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:04.356
Charm, Gus, that's pure charm.

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.191
How'd you like one of these?

01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:12.149
I can get one of those from a dime store.

01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:14.715
Not one that's been in outer space.

01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:17.590
I'm taking these up with me tomorrow.

01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:21.597
Would you like a souvenir
after I get written in history?

01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:24.792
Well, I might, if it's been in outer space.

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.511
See you after outer space.

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:40.470
You got to think ahead to the future.

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.998
Folks have a taste for things
that have been there.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:50.872
I'll give you one of these dimes
I'm taking up so you can play with it...

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:54.550
...and dream about outer space.

01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:00.316
Why don't you just make sure
you don't screw the pooch?

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:06.231
Oh, God, look at this.

01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.873
Go get 'em, Deke!

01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.871
Grissom has just reached the apex
of his flight into outer space...

01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:32.349
...and will be coming down
with the valuable data...

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:35.716
...needed for the future flights
that will actually orbit the Earth.

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:38.519
He will be re-entering the atmosphere now.

01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:22.830
Liberty Bell 7, Liberty Bell 7,
this is Hunt Club 1. Over.

01:56:23.480 --> 01:56:26.199
We're in orbit at this time
around the capsule.

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.630
Are you ready to come in and hook on?

01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:34.990
Roger. This is Hunt Club 1...

01:56:35.240 --> 01:56:37.959
...waiting for your okay
to come in and hook on.

01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:47.438
Roger. I've unplugged my suit,
so I'm kind of warm now.

01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:50.992
Hunt Club 1. Roger.

01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:52.594
One, roger.

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:55.798
Roger. Blow the hatch after we hook on.

01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:59.792
All right, get ready.
Another 15 feet to the right.

01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.948
If you're ready for me to blow the hatch...

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:08.591
...I'll take my helmet off.

01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:11.758
Say again, Liberty Bell.

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:14.149
Waiting for your okay to hook on.

01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:19.632
Who designed this?

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:23.480
Say again, Liberty Bell. We can't hear you.

01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:25.073
I can't get it off.

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:29.995
Liberty Bell, say again.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:32.628
This is Hunt Club 1, waiting for your okay.

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:40.954
What happened?

01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:46.677
It's all right. He's okay.
Go for the capsule.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.592
Help, I'm sinking!

01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:52.520
Get the capsule. He can float in that suit.

01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.431
We need the data in the capsule.

01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:00.272
Throw down a line!

01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:12.594
Help! Throw down the line!

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:16.992
Hey, I'm sinking!

01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:19.072
Forget the fucking capsule!

01:58:23.240 --> 01:58:25.470
We can't pull it. It's full of water.

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:28.840
Hey! Help me over here!

01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:35.989
We've lost it!

01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:37.479
Blow the cable!

01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:43.318
Come back here, damn it!

01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.432
Throw a line down.

01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:52.073
I didn't do anything.

01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.838
I was just lying there.

01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:56.874
It just blew.

02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:02.238
The hatch just blew.

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:17.039
It must have been a technical malfunction.

02:00:18.480 --> 02:00:20.710
The capsule was rocking around a bit.

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:25.192
There were no loose items. I don't see
how I could have hit that button.

02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:29.188
I was just lying there, flat on my back...

02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:30.793
...and it just blew.

02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:45.430
Well, what do you think?

02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:52.315
Explosive hatches have been
on jet fighters for ten years.

02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:55.189
The things have been wrung inside out...

02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:59.433
...subjected to trial by heat,
by water, by shaking, pounding.

02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:04.715
We even drop them from a height
of 100 feet onto concrete...

02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:09.195
...and not one of them
has ever "just blown."

02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:20.830
Are we going to the White House?

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:25.191
Isn't the President coming?

02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:33.030
No ticker-tape parade in New York?

02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:37.829
Not even one in Mitchell, Indiana?

02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:44.674
No Jackie?

02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:56.512
By order of the President
of the United States...

02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.869
...the Distinguished Service Medal...

02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:04.155
...is awarded to Captain Virgil I. Grissom...

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.551
...who distinguished himself by valor
above and beyond the call of duty.

02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:13.279
These actions...

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.275
...reflect great credit upon himself...

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.592
...the Air Force...

02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:22.359
...and the United States of America.

02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:36.034
You proud, boys?

02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:49.432
Hey, look. They filled up the refrigerator.

02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:53.633
Pretty good, huh?

02:03:54.720 --> 02:03:55.835
Pretty good.

02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:58.032
A full refrigerator!

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:02.159
I can see this afternoon
is shaping up just great!

02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:05.028
And the rest of the day. Tomorrow, too!

02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:08.149
What do they want me to do in here?

02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:09.749
Cook?

02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:13.349
Then risk my life and my kids'...

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:17.228
...by dragging them across that highway
to the worst beach in Florida!

02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:20.833
Oh, Gus, I wanted to eat
in the White House.

02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:24.190
I wanted to talk to Jackie about...

02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:26.869
...things.

02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:31.916
Well, look, I've got to go
to the Holiday Inn for some...

02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:34.558
...beer call with the guys.

02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:41.269
All those years of test flying...

02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:46.233
...and all those times I waited
and all those times you weren't there!

02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:49.751
The military promised...

02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:54.199
...and now they are welshing
on that damn compact.

02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:57.760
Look, I am finally
"Mrs. Honorable Astronaut."

02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:00.316
But they are treating me like I'm...

02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:04.469
...Honorable
"Mrs. Squirming Hatch Blower!"

02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:06.392
I didn't do anything wrong!

02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:11.191
The hatch just blew! It was a glitch!
It was a technical malfunction!

02:05:11.520 --> 02:05:13.750
Why in hell won't anyone believe me?

02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:21.912
I know that.

02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:29.998
Gus, I mean are these the goodies?

02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:33.829
Is this how the military pays off?

02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:41.599
Oh, Gus, they owe you.

02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:46.078
But they owe me, too.

02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:48.799
They owe me.

02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:52.148
They owe me, they owe me so much!

02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:33.754
I love you.

02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:41.398
We are here with Virgil I. Grissom
and his lovely wife, Betty.

02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:45.240
Gus has just come back
from the second trip in space.

02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:47.595
Betty, how do you feel about this trip?

02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:49.432
I'm so proud of him.

02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:51.398
I think he was wonderful.

02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:53.590
We're all proud of Gus Grissom.

02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:56.797
Gus, how do you feel about the trip?
Was it a success?

02:06:57.120 --> 02:06:58.712
It was A-okay.

02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:04.357
My God. He lost his capsule
but he's keeping his story.

02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.596
To recap yesterday's dramatic events...

02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:09.678
...here we see America's
newest hero, Gus Grissom.

02:07:09.760 --> 02:07:12.194
He is shouting to save the capsule first.

02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:16.432
Pull that in flight test, it's all over for him.

02:07:17.800 --> 02:07:20.758
He screwed the pooch, partner.
Plain and simple.

02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:24.232
Sometimes you get a pooch
that can't be screwed.

02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:29.118
The President's got his own problems
with the Bay of Pigs.

02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.395
He doesn't want
the astronauts' image tarnished.

02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:34.313
Nothing these guys do
is going to be called a failure.

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:36.197
These astronauts are our Davids.

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:40.273
You think the public would know they're
just doing what monkeys have done.

02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:47.629
You think a monkey knows he's sitting
on a rocket that might explode?

02:07:48.720 --> 02:07:50.836
These astronauts know that.

02:07:52.840 --> 02:07:54.432
I'll tell you something.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.878
It takes a special man to volunteer
for a suicide mission.

02:07:57.960 --> 02:07:59.678
Especially when it's on TV.

02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:05.711
Old Gus, he did all right.

02:08:06.120 --> 02:08:08.190
Though the capsule was lost,
our new hero...

02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:10.430
...Astronaut Gus Grissom, was saved.

02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:15.153
Now President Kennedy has started
an even more ambitious space program.

02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:17.391
Those who came before us...

02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:19.672
...made certain this country...

02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:23.116
...rode the first waves
of the industrial revolution...

02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:26.634
...the first waves of modern invention...

02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:29.029
...and the first wave of nuclear power.

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:31.998
And this generation does not intend...

02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:34.511
...to founder in the backwash...

02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:38.156
...of the coming age of space.
We mean to be a part of it.

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:39.953
We mean to lead it.

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:35.030
You know, I always hated flying.

02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:41.873
When I met you, you were already a pilot,
so I never had a complaint coming.

02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:46.158
When you went up in those planes,
me and the kids....

02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:54.630
We never had any insurance
except a couple months' pay.

02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:59.474
I always hated all that talk
about insurance.

02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:04.550
The government spends
all kinds of time and money...

02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:07.200
...teaching pilots how to be fearless.

02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:12.912
But they don't spend a penny
teaching you how to be...

02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:15.950
...the fearless wife of a test pilot.

02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:22.512
But I guess I liked it.

02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:31.274
I guess I liked the kind of man who could...

02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:34.430
...push the outside of the envelope.

02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:38.195
Flyboy.

02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:45.711
But I never could stand a man
who was one of those "remember-whens."

02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:50.399
Those bitter guys that just sit around
thinking about old times.

02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.911
If I ever see that happen...

02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:04.910
...I'm going right out the front door.

02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:10.838
And you'll never catch me.

02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:15.318
I'm a fearless man,
but I'm scared to death of you.

02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:17.232
No, you're not.

02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:20.079
But you ought to be.

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:42.594
What is it?

02:12:44.120 --> 02:12:46.076
The Russians have sent Titov up.

02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:47.315
Titov's up.

02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:48.830
How long?

02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:49.875
A day.

02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:52.430
A day? A whole day?

02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:54.989
He's orbiting over our country right now.

02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:58.195
We need a man in orbit or it's all over.

02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.478
We're scrapping the Redstone
and going with the Atlas.

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.232
You know what that means.

02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:06.160
We haven't had too much luck
with that rocket.

02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:09.040
We can't take all the precautions we'd like.

02:13:09.440 --> 02:13:11.158
-It'll be dangerous.
-We're ready.

02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:12.912
I said it'll be dangerous.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.389
I said we're ready. 100 percent.

02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:32.754
Inside this trim,
modest suburban home is Annie Glenn...

02:13:33.080 --> 02:13:35.116
...wife of Astronaut John Glenn...

02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:39.598
...sharing the anxiety and pride
of the world at this tense moment...

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.788
...but in a private and crucial way
that only she can understand.

02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:53.557
The Vice President would like
to see Mrs. Glenn.

02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:55.758
He's asking for you again.

02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:58.352
Tell them no.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.911
I'm sorry, she says no.

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:03.031
You don't understand. It is very important.

02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:05.076
The Vice President must see her.

02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:10.029
We are told after the mission's success...

02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:13.556
...the Vice President will come here
and speak with Annie Glenn.

02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:17.191
Meanwhile, John Glenn waits
for the weather to clear...

02:14:17.280 --> 02:14:19.840
...so he can undertake this historic mission.

02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:22.351
You know what the Russians want?

02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:27.479
They want our peckers in their pockets.

02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:32.359
She still says no.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.515
Didn't you tell her I'll bring in ABC-TV...

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.639
...NBC-TV, CBS-TV?

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:44.837
Her words, and mine,
will be heard by millions.

02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:55.873
Where are they going?

02:14:57.920 --> 02:14:59.876
I think the flight's been cancelled.

02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:01.154
Cancelled?

02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:05.399
That's perfect.

02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:09.395
I will go in and console her
on nationwide TV.

02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:12.431
I'll pay her a sympathy call.

02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:43.919
The Vice President would like to make
a sympathy call if he could.

02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.754
-No? What do you mean, "No"?
-I mean, "No."

02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:52.270
What do you mean, "No"?

02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:54.636
Somebody get NASA on the line.

02:15:54.800 --> 02:15:58.839
I'm going to lean on NASA.
I'm going right to the top!

02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:01.632
-To the top.
-Damn right!

02:16:02.040 --> 02:16:04.554
They better tell her to play ball!

02:16:13.080 --> 02:16:14.911
There's a problem with your wife.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.752
-Is it serious?
-We think it is.

02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:19.354
There's a phone hook-up,
we've got her on it.

02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:29.876
It's me. Are you all right?

02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:31.234
What's wrong?

02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:33.232
Johnson...

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.912
...wants...me...

02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.750
...on T...V.

02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.348
The Vice President?

02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:46.715
Tell her to let him in with the networks.

02:16:46.799 --> 02:16:48.119
It's coverage.

02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:53.998
It's important, John.

02:16:54.559 --> 02:16:55.788
It means a lot.

02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:02.749
Listen to me.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.308
If you don't want the Vice President...

02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:10.911
...or the networks,
or anyone else in our house, that's it!

02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:14.079
As far as I'm concerned,
they are not coming in!

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:17.391
And I will back you up 100 percent,
and you tell them that!

02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:23.153
I don't want Johnson or the others
to even put a toe in our house.

02:17:29.639 --> 02:17:33.871
You tell them that Astronaut John Glenn
told you to say that.

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:43.871
I'll talk to you soon.

02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:50.673
You can't do that!

02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:52.591
The Vice President's head of the program!

02:17:52.719 --> 02:17:54.438
You must think of the program!

02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:55.794
You are out of line!

02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:57.911
-I'm out of line?
-Yes, sir!

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:00.308
I run the show here.

02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:02.038
We'll see about that!

02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:05.796
And I'm thinking of changing
the order of flight assignments!

02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:07.952
Who will you get?

02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:10.111
You heard what he said.

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.111
Take it easy, fellows.

02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:18.913
Step aside, pal.

02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:31.714
Pilots!

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.911
Pansies! Cows!

02:18:39.559 --> 02:18:40.993
Gladiolas!

02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:45.029
Isn't there anybody
who can deal with a housewife?

02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:12.759
Waltzing Matilda,
I thought Hank Williams wrote it.

02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:14.671
We don't know who wrote it.

02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:16.397
It's Australian, right?

02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:26.432
Who are you guys?

02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:31.112
We're aborigines.

02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:37.555
Who are you?

02:19:37.639 --> 02:19:38.629
Me?

02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:42.433
I'm an astronaut.

02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:48.840
Well, what do you do here, Astronaut?

02:19:49.440 --> 02:19:53.433
I'm here because a buddy of mine
is getting ready to...

02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:56.680
...fly overhead. Up in outer space.

02:19:57.160 --> 02:19:59.720
And I'll be talking to him on that dish.

02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:01.875
Fly over?

02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:04.272
You blokes do that, too?

02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:06.758
You do that yourself?

02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:09.156
Not me, mate.

02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:11.518
See that old bloke there?

02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:14.035
He know.

02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:15.713
He know the moon.

02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:17.953
He know the star.

02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:20.837
And he know the Milky Way.

02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:23.117
He'll give you a hand.

02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:25.315
He know.

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:32.039
We're gonna need all the help we can get.

02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:03.400
Stand by for final ten-second count.

02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:04.192
The clock is operating.

02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:06.872
We're underway!

02:22:11.880 --> 02:22:15.555
Good Lord, ride all the way.
Godspeed, John Glenn.

02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:29.629
Zero-g, and I feel fine.

02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:33.630
The capsule is turning around.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.911
The view is tremendous!

02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:43.352
I can see clear back,
a big cloud pattern, towards the Cape.

02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:45.237
It's a beautiful sight!

02:23:45.640 --> 02:23:49.918
Roger, Friendship 7.
You have a go, at least seven orbits.

02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:57.238
Roger, Al. Understand,
go at least seven orbits.

02:23:57.320 --> 02:23:58.912
This is Friendship 7.

02:24:24.080 --> 02:24:27.436
Speed is 17,500 miles per hour...

02:24:35.240 --> 02:24:37.470
...and we're moving into night.

02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:59.312
Full moon rising.

02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:04.992
I can almost touch it.

02:25:19.880 --> 02:25:22.599
Friendship 7, come in. Do you read?

02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:27.957
Friendship 7, come in, please.

02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:30.078
This sure was a short day.

02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:31.878
Say again, please. Over.

02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:34.920
That was the shortest day I've run into.

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:37.311
Kind of passes rapidly, huh?

02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:44.437
I can see some lights down there
in Australia, Gordo.

02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:46.599
Where are they from?

02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:50.993
All of Perth and Rockingham
have turned their lights on for you.

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:55.437
And we have a few other lights turned on,
here and there.

02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:02.398
They show up very well.

02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:05.679
Thank everybody for turning them on,
will you?

02:26:06.120 --> 02:26:08.839
We sure will, John. We sure will.

02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:26.912
Heading towards daybreak.

02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:06.755
Lot of cloud coverage today.

02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:15.872
Man, it's beautiful.

02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:32.351
Possibly it's the heat shield.

02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:33.795
It's loose.

02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:37.714
If it comes off--

02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:40.360
If the heat shield comes off, he'll burn up.

02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:43.390
He'll fry when he tries to re-enter.

02:27:57.800 --> 02:27:59.392
Muchea, this is Cape.

02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:02.112
We're showing some trouble.

02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:05.392
We've got a warning light.
Possibly a loose heat shield.

02:28:05.520 --> 02:28:07.750
Check your status lights immediately.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.399
He's coming.

02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:30.753
John, can you hear me?

02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:35.071
Friendship 7, come in, please.

02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:36.998
Try something. Anything.

02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:38.354
Friendship 7, come in.

02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:15.315
This is Friendship 7. Do you read me?

02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:18.393
Wait a second.

02:29:19.960 --> 02:29:22.190
I see something strange out here.

02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:25.557
Oh! My goodness, what the heck is that?

02:29:26.520 --> 02:29:29.557
Sparks and needles of some kind
all over the sky!

02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:32.917
Hey, let me tell you what I'm in up here.

02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:35.629
I'm in a mass of very small particles...

02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:38.991
...that are brilliantly lit up.
Like they're luminescent.

02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:41.071
I never saw anything like it.

02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:43.516
A shower of them coming by me now.

02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.592
They're bright yellow.
They swirl around the capsule...

02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:49.399
...and they're brilliantly lighted.

02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:53.079
Do you think they could be alive?

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:58.829
It sounds ridiculous,
but they look like fireflies or something.

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:04.918
Maybe some Air Force experiment
went amuck.

02:30:05.240 --> 02:30:07.470
Could our astronomers have been wrong?

02:30:07.800 --> 02:30:10.678
Hello, Capcom, do you read me?
This is miraculous!

02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:14.671
Could it be those fireflies,
or whatever they are?

02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:17.071
Of course not. Fireflies?

02:30:19.600 --> 02:30:21.238
Roger, Friendship 7.

02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:26.037
Will you correlate the actions
of the surrounding particles...

02:30:26.120 --> 02:30:28.190
...with that of your control jets?

02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:31.159
Negative.

02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:35.156
I do not think they were coming
from my control jets.

02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:38.191
I'll tell you what I'll try to do.

02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:40.999
I'll try to get some pictures
of these little guys.

02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:42.672
Sounds like a good idea.

02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:45.429
You guys probably think I'm nuts.

02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:48.278
They're very beautiful.

02:30:48.760 --> 02:30:50.716
Look like fireflies on a summer night.

02:30:50.800 --> 02:30:52.518
They just dance around.

02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:30.033
Get out of here!

02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:34.671
Get out of here, you gadgets!

02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:39.589
Heading into daybreak now. Another day.

02:31:39.800 --> 02:31:41.711
Leaving the fireflies behind.

02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:43.951
I have no idea what they were.

02:31:45.080 --> 02:31:46.672
This is Friendship 7.

02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:50.280
That was some night.
That was really exciting.

02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:51.919
He's going into his third orbit.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.992
How much longer are you going
to keep him in the dark?

02:31:55.440 --> 02:31:56.668
What do we tell him?

02:31:56.760 --> 02:31:59.718
He's a pilot.
Tell him the condition of his craft.

02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:06.838
Glenn is in his third orbit...

02:32:06.920 --> 02:32:09.559
...and the flight is going
pretty much as planned.

02:32:09.880 --> 02:32:11.199
No human individual...

02:32:11.280 --> 02:32:13.714
...has ever been so well prepared.

02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:17.675
So far the key word
on this textbook flight is ''operational. ''

02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:19.472
Everything is A-okay.

02:32:21.440 --> 02:32:24.273
We haven't been too lucky
with the Atlas rocket.

02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:27.910
Some say we haven't taken all
the safety precautions we'd like to.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.149
Is this true?

02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:30.958
No, it's absolutely not true.

02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:34.040
The only critical point is the re-entry.

02:32:34.480 --> 02:32:37.199
If the capsule is not at the correct angle...

02:32:37.280 --> 02:32:40.909
...with the blunt end and heat shield down,
it will burn up.

02:32:41.240 --> 02:32:42.992
There is only one hope.

02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:46.033
It might be possible to leave
the retro-rocket package...

02:32:46.120 --> 02:32:48.031
...which covers the heat shield, on.

02:32:48.520 --> 02:32:53.116
The straps may be strong enough
to hold the heat shield in place.

02:32:53.800 --> 02:32:55.552
But if this fails....

02:32:57.160 --> 02:33:00.197
John, you're going to
fly-by-wire for re-entry.

02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:04.595
We recommend you do the best
you can to keep a zero angle. Over.

02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:07.271
Re-entry only three orbits?

02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:09.079
That is correct.

02:33:09.160 --> 02:33:11.310
Do you have a reason for this?

02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:14.910
Not at this time.
This is the judgement of Cape Flight.

02:33:18.840 --> 02:33:22.037
Do you have a time for going
to jettison retro? Over.

02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:27.318
We are not sure your landing bag
is deployed.

02:33:27.960 --> 02:33:31.430
We feel it is possible to re-enter
with the retropackage on.

02:33:31.720 --> 02:33:35.110
We see no difficulty at this time
with that type of re-entry.

02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:36.599
Do you read?

02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:38.668
Roger.

02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:41.393
Understand.

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:46.355
I'll start lining up as carefully as I can
in a minute.

02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:51.390
See whether scanners will pick up
and correct it for good retro-fire attitude.

02:33:52.240 --> 02:33:53.355
If not...

02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:55.951
...I'll correct it myself.

02:34:07.920 --> 02:34:09.399
We're lined up.

02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:11.639
Here we go.

02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:50.352
What's that sound?

02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:52.119
Humming. It's him.

02:34:52.200 --> 02:34:54.111
It's all right. He does that.

02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:01.593
He can't hear you.

02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:03.956
He's hit the ionization blackout.

02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:07.838
No communications are possible
for a few minutes.

02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:11.919
Then we'll know.

02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:23.440
Friendship 7, this is Cape. Do you read?

02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:32.390
This is Cape. Do you read?

02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:40.236
Friendship 7, this is Cape. Do you read?

02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:44.349
Automatic systems are not functioning.
He's in fly-by-wire--

02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:46.473
Finally showed up.

02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:49.115
The one with the big engine.

02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:53.672
Boy, if we'd only had
one of those a few years back.

02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:58.992
The bad news is the entire program's
probably going to be scrapped.

02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:03.749
From now on, the astronaut boys
in Houston have got the only ticket.

02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:08.075
Barring, of course, some unforeseen event.

02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:31.992
The Russians set a new record
of 1 14,000 feet...

02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:34.036
...going straight off the ground.

02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:36.714
Nobody cares about
that kind of record anymore.

02:38:37.400 --> 02:38:40.392
All they want now
is capsules up in outer space.

02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:47.433
I get a feeling this plane might be able
to beat that Russian record.

02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:51.753
You might be right.

02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:39.431
And here they come!

02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:51.712
Looky here what I brought you!

02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:34.794
Smile, hon.

02:40:35.760 --> 02:40:37.512
My fellow citizens...

02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:44.153
...America's Mercury astronauts!

02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:58.278
Welcome to Houston, your new home.

02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:03.151
Your neighbors here and I,
we'd like to give you this little barbecue...

02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:07.079
...Texas style!

02:41:48.720 --> 02:41:52.952
Since you're relocating here,
to show appreciation for all you've done...

02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:56.039
...Mr. Sharp is contributing the land...

02:41:56.120 --> 02:41:58.111
...the contractors the homes...

02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:01.073
...and department stores, the furnishings.

02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:04.753
Which one are you?

02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:10.274
Which one's Glenn? I want to meet him.

02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:13.359
He's over there.

02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:25.437
I'm going to the moon,
I swear to God, I'm on my way.

02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:31.753
Hi, little gal.
Damned glad to meet you, too.

02:42:31.920 --> 02:42:35.435
I heard an awful lot of good things
about you, gal.

02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:45.709
We got it.

02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:48.873
Steak. All the trimmings.

02:42:50.680 --> 02:42:52.557
Just like Pancho's.

02:42:55.280 --> 02:42:57.191
Steak tastes about the same...

02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:00.713
...only there's a lot
more trimmings now, Gus.

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:04.753
You know, it's funny.

02:43:05.720 --> 02:43:09.918
Here I am, I got $25,000 a year
for a magazine contract.

02:43:10.840 --> 02:43:13.354
I got a free house with all the furnishings.

02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:15.112
Got me a Corvette.

02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:19.436
I got a free lunch from one end of America
to the other...

02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:22.670
...and I ain't even been up there yet.

02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:25.835
I noticed that.

02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:29.276
Oh, you noticed that?
You noticed I hadn't been up there yet?

02:43:31.960 --> 02:43:34.315
They're saving the best for last.

02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:38.920
Yeah, I guess so, Hot Dog. I guess so.

02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:43.510
Just watch you don't screw the pooch.

02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:06.831
We're talking to Gordon Cooper.
He will be the next to orbit the Earth.

02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:13.310
Since you're the last of the original seven
and the least well known...

02:44:13.600 --> 02:44:18.116
...could you begin by telling us
who was the best pilot you ever saw?

02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:21.229
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:30.914
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:36.713
I'll tell you.

02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:41.511
I've seen a lot of them,
and most of them were pictures on a wall--

02:44:42.760 --> 02:44:46.799
I said, "pictures on a wall,"
back at some place that...

02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:50.996
...doesn't even exist anymore.

02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:55.473
Some of them are...

02:44:55.600 --> 02:44:57.511
...right here in this room.

02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:00.872
And some of them are...

02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:05.553
...they're still out there somewhere,
doing what they always do.

02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:08.911
Going up each day
in a hurtling piece of machinery...

02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:11.759
...putting their hides out on the line...

02:45:12.160 --> 02:45:14.469
...hanging it out over the edge...

02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:18.309
...pushing back the outside
of that envelope and hauling it back.

02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:21.833
But there was...

02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:26.791
...one pilot I once saw who I think
truly did have the right--

02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:29.838
How close did you ever come
to not hauling it back?

02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:37.190
Who is the best pilot I ever saw?

02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:39.590
Well, you're looking at him.

02:45:57.080 --> 02:45:58.832
You got any Beemans?

02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:01.992
I might have me a stick.

02:46:02.080 --> 02:46:04.719
Loan me some. I'll pay you back later.

02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:07.719
Fair enough.

02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:12.077
Think I see a plane over here
with my name on it.

02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:15.918
Now you're talking.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:31.433
Hey, what's that?

02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:33.511
Anyone got clearance?

02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:39.270
What kind of a plane is that?

02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:47.838
Aircraft on ramp, did you file a flight plan?

02:46:48.800 --> 02:46:51.758
Aircraft on ramp, did you file a flight plan?

02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:55.915
I'm taking her up to wring her out a bit.
Any objections?

02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:57.359
It's Yeager.

02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:01.113
No objections.

02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:03.271
You are clear to taxi.

02:47:04.800 --> 02:47:06.870
He must have clearance. Right?

02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:09.031
Yeah. Sure, he must.

02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:11.113
It's here someplace.

02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:13.310
Now, in honor of...

02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:17.189
...these, the greatest pilots
in the history of mankind...

02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:21.514
...it gives me great pleasure, great pride,
to present to you...

02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:23.872
...Miss Sally Rand!

02:52:09.480 --> 02:52:11.391
Stretch it! Stretch it!

02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:13.799
You can do it!

02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:18.596
Just a little bit more.
104,000, here you go.

02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:25.518
Christ Almighty!

02:55:36.800 --> 02:55:38.472
Sir, over there.

02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:42.279
Is that a man?

02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:47.190
Yeah, you're damn right it is!

02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:53.595
We hate to disturb you, buddy, but...

02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:55.993
...we've got a launch.

02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:02.596
There's millions of people watching,
and we thought maybe....

02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:05.952
Yep. Well, no sweat. Let's go.

02:57:06.680 --> 02:57:09.752
I'm ready when you are, John, 100 percent.

02:57:15.360 --> 02:57:17.271
Ten...nine....

02:57:57.880 --> 02:57:59.632
Go.

02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:09.070
Go, Hot Dog, go!

02:58:13.720 --> 02:58:16.280
"Up we go into the wild blue yonder."

02:58:16.680 --> 02:58:20.229
Thirty seconds and fuel is go,
oxygen is go...

02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:23.471
...cabin pressure on the top peg.
Altimeter is working.

02:58:25.240 --> 02:58:27.151
Have a good ride, buddy. Go!

02:58:31.680 --> 02:58:34.069
The sun is coming through the window.

02:58:35.800 --> 02:58:38.678
Oh, Lord, what a heavenly light.

02:58:50.800 --> 02:58:53.234
The Mercury program was over.

02:58:53.880 --> 02:58:57.077
Four years later,
Astronaut Gus Grissom was killed...

02:58:57.160 --> 02:58:59.799
...along with Astronauts White
and Chaffee...

02:58:59.920 --> 02:59:02.878
...when fire swept through
their Apollo capsule.

02:59:03.880 --> 02:59:07.634
But on that glorious day in May, 1963...

02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:11.350
...Gordo Cooper went higher, farther...

02:59:11.640 --> 02:59:14.029
...and faster than any other American.
