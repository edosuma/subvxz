00:06.542 --> 00:09.166
[Meredith]
<i>During our ER rotation in med school,</i>

00:09.500 --> 00:11.917
<i>my roommate fell in love</i>
<i>with emergency medicine.</i>

00:12.041 --> 00:13.000
[sighing]

00:13.083 --> 00:14.208
[Owen] Avery.

00:14.291 --> 00:17.458
Care to tell me why you've pulled
all of my residents from the ER?

00:17.542 --> 00:20.291
Yeah, I just wanted to speed up
our free COVID testing,

00:20.375 --> 00:22.834
but I mean, hey, if you want,
I guess we could...

00:22.917 --> 00:25.125
we could start turning them away.

00:25.208 --> 00:27.458
It's a great program.

00:27.542 --> 00:28.875
Forget I asked. Okay?

00:29.333 --> 00:31.041
[Meredith]
<i>She loved being on the frontline.</i>

00:31.166 --> 00:33.875
<i>She felt that's where</i>
<i>she had the most impact.</i>

00:33.959 --> 00:37.959
<i>But I knew three days in</i>
<i>emergency medicine was not for me.</i>

00:38.083 --> 00:40.125
<i>Most treatments were meant</i>
<i>to just tie patients over</i>

00:40.208 --> 00:43.709
<i>until they could see their own physician,</i>
<i>a specialist or a surgeon.</i>

00:43.792 --> 00:46.875
-[Teddy] <i>And how is her base deficit?</i>
-The same as I told you five minutes ago.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.166
-And her inflammatory markers?
-<i>Altman</i>.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.500
<i>We would not be here</i>
<i>without your tireless effort.</i>

00:51.583 --> 00:53.583
<i>But you still have two days off.</i>

00:53.667 --> 00:56.166
<i>Enjoy them, because you're gonna</i>
<i>miss them when you're back.</i>

00:56.250 --> 00:59.417
-Okay. Thanks. One more thing.
<i>-Goodbye, Altman.</i>

01:00.417 --> 01:02.709
[Meredith] <i>And I thought</i>
<i>what's the point of starting </i><i>something</i>

01:02.792 --> 01:03.959
<i>you won't get to finish.</i>

01:04.041 --> 01:08.375
...closer, I saw it didn't have a ball
in its mouth, it had an avocado.

01:08.458 --> 01:11.250
No idea where he got it from. [sighs]

01:11.333 --> 01:12.667
You're gonna love dogs.

01:12.750 --> 01:15.875
You're gonna love everything
about the outside.

01:15.959 --> 01:18.250
Trees. Grass. Rainbows.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.667
-Isn't that right, Luna?
-Wait! Wait, wait.

01:20.750 --> 01:22.166
-Say her name again.
-Why?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.166
Because I think she understood it!
Her face changed.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.709
-Luna. Luna!
-Yeah. Luna.

01:27.792 --> 01:30.125
For what it's worth, she doesn't
respond when I say her name either.

01:30.208 --> 01:32.375
Yes, she does. She's a genius.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.125
All right if I complete my rounds now?

01:34.208 --> 01:36.166
Or is she such a genius
that she can look after herself?

01:36.250 --> 01:37.917
[both] No. Go ahead.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.959
Wilson, Chief. While I think
these visits do Luna the world of good,

01:43.041 --> 01:46.166
I have about 15 other patients and
their very worried parents waiting for me.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.125
So if you don't mind...

01:47.208 --> 01:48.709
-[Bailey] No, no, no.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:49.709 --> 01:50.625
Thank you.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.875
No. Go back where you came--

01:59.959 --> 02:01.917
I already have
all the clothes in the house.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.208
Ellis thought her laundry went
under her bed, not in the hamper.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.750
[Scout crying]

02:08.458 --> 02:12.417
-He just ate.
-I ate a lot when I was a kid. Still do.

02:13.041 --> 02:16.125
-[sighs] Okay. Baby or laundry?
-Neither.

02:16.208 --> 02:18.667
I just want everything to stop.
The whole planet.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.041
It could just stop turning
and we could all just melt.

02:21.125 --> 02:24.458
Is it for us? Is it for us? Is it for us?

02:24.542 --> 02:28.291
-Is what for us, buddy?
-The camping truck! The camping truck!

02:28.375 --> 02:29.291
[crying continues]

02:29.375 --> 02:31.500
<i>♪ Over you ♪</i>

02:31.834 --> 02:34.417
<i>♪ Darling, over you ♪</i>

02:36.083 --> 02:38.959
-Dad?
-Hey, kiddos!

02:39.125 --> 02:40.417
[laughing]

02:41.166 --> 02:45.041
-Surprise!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! COVID! And stranger!

02:45.125 --> 02:48.291
We've talked on the computer screen
lots of times. We're old friends.

02:48.375 --> 02:49.959
-Where are your masks?
-Where's my grandson?

02:50.041 --> 02:51.041
That's what I want to know.

02:52.375 --> 02:54.625
Don't worry, honey,
we've been totally safe.

02:54.709 --> 02:57.792
Two-week quarantine from Colorado
while we took in the scenery.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.417
Your dad packed for everything.
We didn't even have to shop.

03:00.500 --> 03:04.083
Haven't spoken face to face
with another soul since we left.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.542
-It was so romantic.
-[both chuckling]

03:08.875 --> 03:11.083
I guess I'll go get Scout?

03:11.166 --> 03:12.583
-Okay.
-I'll do you one better.

03:12.667 --> 03:16.125
We thought we could take all the kids
to check out Mount Rainier.

03:16.208 --> 03:18.709
Fun! Can we go, please?

03:18.792 --> 03:22.792
Uh... I'm sorry. You're--
You want to take everyone from here?

03:22.875 --> 03:27.291
Those first few months with a newborn,
impossible without help.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.959
Only if it's okay.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.917
-Okay!
-Yes!

03:34.583 --> 03:38.125
Have I told you two how much I love you?
Because I definitely love you.

03:38.208 --> 03:39.583
And we love you too, honey.

03:39.667 --> 03:41.667
Couldn't have asked
for a better daughter-in-law.

03:42.834 --> 03:44.875
She is the mother of my grandson,

03:44.959 --> 03:47.000
and even if you haven't
gotten around to proposing,

03:47.083 --> 03:49.709
I'm gonna call her
what I want to call her.

03:49.792 --> 03:51.625
I don't get why
they're not married either.

03:51.709 --> 03:54.917
[Maureen] Okay. Time to hit the road.
I'll go get Scout.

03:55.291 --> 03:57.041
I can't wait to meet my grandson.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.959
[distant siren wailing]

04:04.583 --> 04:07.000
-That's it?
-I can go again if you want.

04:07.083 --> 04:09.542
You'll get a text in 30 minutes
with the results.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.417
-Thank you.
-All right.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.208
I've almost used all my kits.
I'm so sorry.

04:13.291 --> 04:16.041
-It's just the-the turn-out's so high.
-Relax, Schmitt.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.417
We have more in the van.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.250
If we run low, we can go over
to the drive-through site at Station 19.

04:20.333 --> 04:23.458
-They've got extras.
-Oh! Wow. That's amazing.

04:23.542 --> 04:24.834
How did we get more kits?

04:24.917 --> 04:27.125
Twenty hours of virtual meetings
with the Fox Foundation,

04:27.208 --> 04:28.583
convincing them
it's the right thing to do, that's how.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.500
You don't just ask your mom? [chuckles]

04:34.500 --> 04:36.083
-Ready for you, sir.
-Thank you.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.792
Go ahead and have a seat. How you doing?

04:37.875 --> 04:40.375
Good. One of our cashiers
tested positive at the store.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.583
I feel fine, but, you know,
I figured I should make sure.

04:42.667 --> 04:46.166
Good, smart. Okay. Can you take
your mask down a little bit for me?

04:48.750 --> 04:51.083
All right. One more.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.625
-Great. All set.
-How many days till I know?

04:53.709 --> 04:56.333
Well, it's a rapid test,
so about 30 minutes for your results.

04:56.417 --> 04:59.000
Oh, wow, I won't be late
for my shift then. Thank you so much.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.667
You're very welcome. Thank you.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.917
I wouldn't be the surgeon I am
without you, Meredith.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.083
You taught me to push myself,
to innovate, to see what's possible.

05:12.166 --> 05:14.125
And to trust my instinct.

05:14.208 --> 05:18.333
And right now, that's telling me
to change to OB.

05:19.375 --> 05:22.125
-Go with God?
-Meredith wouldn't say that.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.709
I have literally never known
what Dr. Grey is going to say.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.500
Ooh! Why don't you be me and I be her?

05:26.583 --> 05:29.458
How about you be you and her,
so I can get back to the testing tent?

05:29.542 --> 05:31.834
She's my mentor.
I don't want to disappoint her or Bailey

05:31.917 --> 05:33.750
-or Dr. Webber. This is stressful.
-[cell phone beeps]

05:33.834 --> 05:36.458
-So is pissing off Dr. Avery.
-Oh, crap. Trauma.

05:36.542 --> 05:39.625
-I gotta go.
-I had to go first!

05:42.500 --> 05:45.208
-Arthur Beaton, 14 months.
-Hold up, Khan.

05:45.291 --> 05:47.125
Chris, did you want to wait for Hollie?

05:47.208 --> 05:49.208
Or I can set you up with the video-chat
on the tablet?

05:49.291 --> 05:51.500
No. Thank you.

05:51.583 --> 05:54.250
It's...not a good time.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.667
She has work, so go ahead.

05:57.083 --> 06:00.500
Arthur Beaton, 14 months,
diagnosed with multiple VSDs,

06:00.583 --> 06:02.166
cardiomyopathy and heart failure.

06:02.250 --> 06:06.667
He's currently on day 12 of ECMO,
waiting for a transplant, status 1A.

06:06.750 --> 06:09.125
We thought this would only be
for a few days.

06:09.208 --> 06:12.291
Do a lot of kids with his condition
stay on it this long?

06:12.375 --> 06:15.417
-It's unusual.
-It means he's strong.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.542
He's already held his own
through several procedures.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.375
None of which have fixed
the holes in his heart.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.166
We're hoping he can
hang on a little bit longer,

06:24.250 --> 06:26.917
until a donor heart comes through.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.125
I'll be back in a couple hours. Okay?

06:34.291 --> 06:36.000
Chief. Welcome back.

06:36.959 --> 06:39.083
So this the car that got stuck in a truck?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.959
Yeah. Ran right up the loading ramp.
They had to cut open the side of the van.

06:42.041 --> 06:44.083
-[sirens approaching]
-Newlyweds, I heard.

06:45.291 --> 06:46.667
Hell of a honeymoon.

06:48.917 --> 06:52.083
[Ben] Shayne Riley, 45.
Unstable pelvis and lower abdominal pain

06:52.166 --> 06:54.333
after sustaining crush injuries in an MVC.

06:54.417 --> 06:58.125
Initially unresponsive, but now alert
and oriented after saline boluses.

06:58.208 --> 07:00.000
Shayne, you are in good hands.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.583
And I'm not just saying that
because Dr. Bailey here is my wife.

07:02.667 --> 07:03.959
But you are looking really good, Chief.

07:06.333 --> 07:09.792
[Vic] Karissa Skolaski, 42.
Vital signs stable, A and O times three.

07:09.875 --> 07:12.125
Minor lacerations to the face,
arms and legs.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.709
-Patient complains of headache.
-Let's take her to Trauma One.

07:14.792 --> 07:17.834
-Shayne? Where's my husband?
-He's right over there, ma'am.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.834
-He's being taken care of.
-Shayne! I'm sorry, babe!

07:20.917 --> 07:23.041
I didn't mean it! Can he hear me?

07:23.125 --> 07:25.458
-He's heavily sedated, ma'am.
-I can hear her just fine.

07:25.542 --> 07:28.250
I'm just not talking to her. Ever again.

07:31.625 --> 07:35.875
Improving ground glass opacities.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

07:35.959 --> 07:38.625
And no signs of stroke on head CT.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.083
This is great news!

07:42.709 --> 07:43.834
It's not great news?

07:44.375 --> 07:48.875
Great news doesn't matter
if she's too weak to stay awake.

08:01.041 --> 08:03.542
Karissa, you can't get up.
We're waiting on Neuro to see you. Okay?

08:03.625 --> 08:06.625
I'm fine. But my boyfriend... husband.

08:06.709 --> 08:08.458
He hates needles. He really hates needles.

08:08.542 --> 08:11.291
He's being worked on by excellent doctors.
Can you follow my finger?

08:11.417 --> 08:13.959
Can't you put us in the same room?
I really need to talk to him.

08:14.041 --> 08:16.417
When we were in the accident,
I kinda said a thing and I feel terrible.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.709
You're in luck. They pay me to help people
who feel terrible.

08:18.792 --> 08:21.250
-Any loss of consciousness? Dizziness?
-I don't think so.

08:21.333 --> 08:24.959
So what? You cheated on him? You stole
all his money? You ran over Grandma?

08:25.041 --> 08:27.375
-CT is calling for her. You want to come?
-Please and thank yous.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.500
-Squeeze my hands, please.
-I told the paramedics to save me first.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.166
Over him. My husband.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.083
Yikes.
Maybe you can blame that on a brain bleed.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.834
-Can you please tell him I'm okay?
-[Koracick] Let's go.

08:39.125 --> 08:43.750
You know what else she said? That except
for her, no one would miss me if I died.

08:43.834 --> 08:46.250
She thinks I'm a loner
and no one cares about me.

08:46.333 --> 08:49.834
A lot of people panic
on their wedding day. I know I did.

08:49.917 --> 08:51.625
Dr. Hunt knows...

08:53.583 --> 08:55.125
-Does this hurt?
-Ow! Yeah.

08:55.208 --> 08:58.250
Don't people normally panic
before saying "I do?"

08:58.333 --> 09:00.083
We'd already been married four hours.

09:00.166 --> 09:03.875
I'm not sure. But your scan does show
you have an open book pelvic fracture.

09:03.959 --> 09:06.750
We're gonna have to do a CT to make sure
there's no other abdominal injuries,

09:06.834 --> 09:08.875
but you will need surgery. Okay?

09:08.959 --> 09:12.834
Shayne, we're taking Karissa to CT,
but she's stable and feeling okay.

09:12.917 --> 09:14.959
Let me guess, she asked to go first?

09:15.041 --> 09:19.083
-No, she's very worried about you.
-Good. Don't tell her how I am.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.542
-She doesn't get to know anything.
-Let's go.

09:23.458 --> 09:26.458
I'm just going to not tell her anything?
She's terrified.

09:26.542 --> 09:27.667
You know the rules.

09:30.125 --> 09:31.208
[sighs]

09:32.667 --> 09:36.917
-It's not just me, right? This is weird.
-[Amelia] Super weird.

09:37.583 --> 09:40.709
It's like we won the lottery of silence.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.667
Where do we even start?

09:44.125 --> 09:48.583
-By getting naked.
-Okay, loving that.

09:51.875 --> 09:56.333
Whoa, Amelia. I don't think you're
grasping the extent of our freedom here.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.375
There are no baby monitors,

09:58.458 --> 10:01.208
there are no homework assignments,
no one--no one's hungry.

10:01.291 --> 10:04.959
-I'm a little hungry.
-Then let's have sex in the kitchen.

10:05.041 --> 10:08.250
We can do whatever we want!
You realize that?

10:08.333 --> 10:10.875
We can... we can be loud.

10:10.959 --> 10:12.375
Do you remember being able to be loud?

10:15.542 --> 10:16.375
What's wrong?

10:24.667 --> 10:27.792
Okay. All right. Amelia...

10:28.542 --> 10:29.709
Look at me.

10:30.959 --> 10:33.208
-Oh, my God! No!
-No?

10:33.291 --> 10:34.250
Get up, get up!

10:35.208 --> 10:37.875
I thought-- I thought you were crying
because my mom and Zola...

10:37.959 --> 10:40.458
[crying] No, I'm not, I'm... I just...

10:40.542 --> 10:42.959
I just really need to be crying right now.

10:48.667 --> 10:50.000
Okay.

10:52.750 --> 10:53.875
[exhales]

10:55.792 --> 10:57.709
Marcel tested positive.
He needs to be home isolating.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.166
I told him that, but apparently
he lives with his family.

11:00.250 --> 11:04.083
Six people in a two-bedroom apartment,
including his grandpa.

11:04.166 --> 11:06.875
He doesn't want to get them sick.
Can't we just admit him?

11:06.959 --> 11:09.083
-Get him some care...
-This is not a hotel, Schmitt.

11:09.166 --> 11:12.041
He can't afford to stay anywhere else.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.875
Okay. Book him a hotel room.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.291
On you? You're sure?

11:20.375 --> 11:22.000
It's a matter of public health. Okay?

11:22.083 --> 11:26.166
Anybody needs a room,
just book them a hotel. No questions.

11:27.083 --> 11:28.083
We got you a hotel.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.583
-Chris?
-I had to get out of there for a minute.

11:44.667 --> 11:48.083
I understand. You want to get outside,
get some fresh air? There's a chapel.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.583
So I can pray
for someone else's kid to die?

11:56.083 --> 11:59.667
I lied earlier.
Hollie wasn't on a work call.

12:00.625 --> 12:02.625
She hasn't signed on to work in weeks.

12:03.250 --> 12:06.166
I don't know if it's postpartum depression

12:06.250 --> 12:09.417
or Arthur or the world...

12:09.500 --> 12:13.208
Listen, it's... it's been
a terrible ordeal for the pair of you.

12:13.291 --> 12:15.709
She's so depressed
she can't get out of bed.

12:16.291 --> 12:21.375
When COVID hit, seeing people
lose whole families in a week...

12:22.333 --> 12:26.291
we knew we had to be careful
because of Arthur's heart condition.

12:26.375 --> 12:27.250
And we were.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.959
And in the end, it didn't matter.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.417
I'm still losing them.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.834
The only thing keeping me going
right now is the hope for a miracle.

12:38.917 --> 12:42.667
Arthur gets a heart,
Hollie comes back to life.

12:42.750 --> 12:44.834
And we a family again.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.166
And I know we can't have our miracle
unless someone else loses theirs...

12:49.250 --> 12:52.166
lives what I'm living right now,
gets shattered.

12:54.458 --> 12:55.959
I pray for it anyway.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.208
Because Arthur...

12:59.500 --> 13:00.917
[Hayes] He's your son.

13:01.834 --> 13:04.750
I can't lose him, Dr. Hayes.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.291
We can't lose him.

13:07.125 --> 13:08.458
Please.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.500
-How's she looking?
<i>-Squirmy.</i>

13:21.583 --> 13:23.166
<i>-Karissa?</i>
-Did I hear Dr. Wilson?

13:23.250 --> 13:24.709
Is Shayne okay?

13:24.792 --> 13:25.834
Uh... [clears throat]

13:26.583 --> 13:30.000
<i>Sorry, Karissa. </i><i>Patient confidentiality.</i>

13:30.083 --> 13:33.208
Confidentiality? From his wife?

13:33.875 --> 13:37.625
Wait. Did he ask you not to tell me?

13:37.709 --> 13:41.417
-That is also confidential.
-He's still mad.

13:41.542 --> 13:44.583
My sisters said we were crazy
for moving so quickly.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.792
<i>They said three months is not enough time</i>
<i>to get to know someone</i>

13:47.875 --> 13:49.750
<i>you're gonna spend</i>
<i>the rest of your life with.</i>

13:49.834 --> 13:53.000
-Well, neither is six years.
-Scans are up.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.500
Karissa, you have a very
small contusion on your brain.

13:56.583 --> 13:59.000
It's benign and a very minor bleed,

13:59.083 --> 14:01.959
so minor I don't think we can
blame it for anything. Sorry.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.959
<i>But we do have to keep you overnight</i>
<i>for observation.</i>

14:05.041 --> 14:06.000
I was wrong.

14:06.625 --> 14:08.792
<i>I was wrong that no one would miss him.</i>

14:10.750 --> 14:15.959
Because it's only been a few hours
and I miss him so much I could burst.

14:16.041 --> 14:18.041
[Karissa crying]

14:23.625 --> 14:25.834
Hi. I got your page. What's up?

14:25.917 --> 14:28.959
Can you think of a salvage procedure
we can do on a 14-month-old

14:29.041 --> 14:31.542
-with multiple VSDs?
-Another one?

14:31.625 --> 14:35.792
-We just did one two weeks ago.
-It's the same boy. Arthur Beaton.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.792
-The one we put on ECMO?
-He's hanging on.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.917
What about a double pump EXCOR?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.375
You know, an artificial heart
that can take over from the ventricles.

14:43.458 --> 14:46.000
I know what it is. I...

14:46.083 --> 14:47.917
Arthur's chest cavity is too small.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.750
The cannulas would push
against vital organs.

14:50.834 --> 14:54.417
We'd have to leave him open
and leave him on a vent.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.250
He's been on ECMO for 12 days.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.709
I don't think he has the strength
to withstand a transplant,

14:59.792 --> 15:01.834
and that's even if we could find a donor.

15:01.917 --> 15:03.542
So then what do you suggest?

15:04.166 --> 15:08.667
I think you should have a very difficult
conversation with his parents. It's time.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.834
Aren't you supposed to be some sort
of genius or something?

15:10.917 --> 15:12.417
Youngest cardio chief in the country?

15:12.500 --> 15:15.041
More innovative and published
than any of your peers?

15:15.125 --> 15:17.458
So what, you're just gonna give up?

15:17.542 --> 15:20.291
We've been at this for months.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.500
We have done everything we can
for that boy.

15:22.583 --> 15:26.417
At this point, we're just prolonging
his pain, and his family's.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.542
It's not giving up.
It's letting them go on.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.208
[whistling]

15:44.583 --> 15:45.875
[sighing]

15:47.000 --> 15:51.542
It just hit me that it's been months since
I've been able to feel whatever I want

15:51.625 --> 15:55.625
without worrying
that I will permanently scar a child.

15:55.709 --> 15:59.959
The constant pressure of not
ruining a life is exhausting.

16:01.834 --> 16:05.500
Are you mad that I shouted no
and made you get up?

16:05.583 --> 16:09.291
I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at my mom for bringing it up.

16:09.917 --> 16:12.250
Are you wanting to get married?

16:12.333 --> 16:16.333
After you shouted no and made me get up?
Not so much.

16:16.417 --> 16:19.291
I meant, "No,
you're misreading the moment."

16:19.375 --> 16:21.166
Not, "No, I don't wanna marry you."

16:22.583 --> 16:25.542
-So you do want to marry me?
-I wasn't saying I want to marry you,

16:25.625 --> 16:28.834
or I don't want to marry you. I, um...

16:28.917 --> 16:31.709
haven't thought about it.
I haven't had time.

16:31.792 --> 16:34.667
I haven't had time either,
but I've still thought about it.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.083
What have you thought?

16:38.250 --> 16:39.291
[sighs]

16:41.041 --> 16:42.125
I love you.

16:42.208 --> 16:45.750
And I love Scout
and I love us together. And...

16:46.375 --> 16:49.583
You know, marriage is, uh...

16:49.667 --> 16:52.291
I guess kind how society locks it all in.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.917
-But it doesn't lock it in.
-It doesn't lock it in.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.542
-And your parents' divorce was hell.
-It was hell!

16:57.625 --> 17:00.000
And I swore that I'd never
put a kid through that.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.917
Mmm-hmm. So...

17:03.000 --> 17:04.917
I know that your mom has big ideas...

17:06.083 --> 17:11.500
and Zola has big wedding dress dreams,
but, um...

17:12.583 --> 17:14.417
Have you really changed your mind?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.500
I was a terrible wife.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.458
-You had a brain tumor.
-I did.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.208
But I'm not sure that sexy brain tumor
can take all the credit.

17:25.291 --> 17:28.583
I still think I'm wired
for self-destruction.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.667
Why do you think that?

17:32.959 --> 17:36.917
Because every day, for a lot of days now,

17:37.000 --> 17:40.625
I go to sleep thinking about getting high.

17:40.709 --> 17:44.375
And I wake up thinking about getting high.

17:44.458 --> 17:48.125
And sometimes in the middle
of feeding Scout,

17:48.208 --> 17:51.917
I zone out and think about getting high.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.709
And he won't let me
tell his wife anything.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.709
It's their wedding day
and he's already over her.

18:07.792 --> 18:11.667
Which is just... it's just sad
and messy and...

18:11.750 --> 18:15.500
And it's not that I'm sick of adults.

18:15.583 --> 18:18.083
Okay, I'm a little--
I'm a little sick of adults.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.959
Adults are always here
on the worst day of their lives.

18:21.041 --> 18:24.166
And I am so sick of worst days.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.750
And people being terrified of me
because I'm cutting them open.

18:28.417 --> 18:30.125
But with moms,

18:30.208 --> 18:33.792
they want you here,
even though it's scary sometimes.

18:33.875 --> 18:38.250
Because you being there
means they're getting to meet their baby.

18:38.333 --> 18:40.125
Their dream.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.834
And they can't do it without my help.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.417
Since, uh... Since Alex left, um...

18:50.208 --> 18:53.834
my house hasn't been my happiest place.

18:53.917 --> 18:56.500
So...

18:56.583 --> 18:58.333
I want work to be.

18:58.917 --> 19:02.625
And I think that you get that.
And I am so grateful to you.

19:02.709 --> 19:07.458
Because you believed in me
before I believed in myself.

19:08.834 --> 19:12.583
And I will tell you all of this again
when you're awake.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.500
Please, please be awake soon.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.583
Please be well soon.

19:22.792 --> 19:25.792
We can't take any more
worst days around here.

19:30.417 --> 19:31.959
I've booked 18 hotel rooms.

19:32.041 --> 19:33.875
The manager wondered
if you'd rather book a whole floor.

19:33.959 --> 19:36.750
We got a lot of positives. Tell him
we'll take all the rooms we can get.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.875
Thank you. I think I've memorized
your credit card number.

19:38.959 --> 19:41.166
When did hotel stays
become part of the plan?

19:41.250 --> 19:45.083
Well, people need more than a test.
And quarantining isn't easy for everybody.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.542
And you realized that today?

19:46.625 --> 19:48.792
-Excuse me?
-You know he's your boss, right?

19:48.875 --> 19:50.458
-And technically, so am I.
-I'm sorry.

19:50.542 --> 19:52.125
-Schmitt, give us a minute?
-Well, don't fire her.

19:52.208 --> 19:53.417
Schmitt!

19:55.208 --> 19:56.542
Come here, please.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.000
I assume that wasn't your real question,

19:59.083 --> 20:00.875
so would you like to tell me
what is going on?

20:00.959 --> 20:05.125
You're booking up hotel rooms.
So is Seattle Partners.

20:05.291 --> 20:09.250
Okay, I've heard of them.
A group of community organizations, right?

20:09.333 --> 20:12.333
Long-standing community organizations.

20:12.417 --> 20:15.500
That have been providing housing
and wrap-around services

20:15.583 --> 20:19.333
for people who test positive for COVID
in low income neighborhoods.

20:19.417 --> 20:22.458
-Okay, so the more the better...
-Yeah. Maybe in theory.

20:22.542 --> 20:25.875
But they can't book hotel rooms
at their discounted rate

20:25.959 --> 20:28.208
because the local doctor's
booking them at full price.

20:28.291 --> 20:32.417
And hotels are kicking people out
to make room for your new arrivals.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.000
I got it.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.083
I apologize. I didn't know that.

20:37.166 --> 20:40.333
Great. We'll just tell everyone
it wasn't on purpose.

20:40.417 --> 20:42.208
That should keep them real warm tonight.

20:54.917 --> 20:55.959
[Link chuckles]

20:57.750 --> 20:59.500
Oh, I fell asleep?

20:59.583 --> 21:02.125
I think it's a defense mechanism.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.458
-I've noticed you do that.
-Do what?

21:04.542 --> 21:07.333
Fall asleep when
you are emotionally overwhelmed.

21:08.125 --> 21:09.583
Some people cry.

21:09.709 --> 21:11.750
Some people talk. Some people yell.

21:11.834 --> 21:14.542
-You... fall asleep.
-Right.

21:14.625 --> 21:17.583
Well, I'm not avoiding my feelings
if that's what you're implying.

21:17.667 --> 21:22.458
I just process them better
while I'm unconscious.

21:24.041 --> 21:27.166
Okay. Let's figure this out.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.875
There's not much to figure out.

21:29.709 --> 21:32.834
-I'm an addict.
-You're an addict in recovery.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.542
So what, you need to hit up a meeting?

21:34.625 --> 21:38.875
I've talked about it in meetings.
A lot of us have.

21:38.959 --> 21:43.500
And this pandemic feels like Satan has
designed the perfect set of circumstances

21:43.583 --> 21:45.750
to make sobriety seem impossible.

21:46.208 --> 21:50.625
Isolation, fear, futility,
anger, hopelessness.

21:50.709 --> 21:54.083
I mean, name a trigger, it is stronger.

21:54.959 --> 21:58.000
For the record, I don't believe in Satan.
I'm just saying it feels like that.

21:58.083 --> 22:01.208
Also, what's weird
is I'm not even craving pills.

22:01.291 --> 22:04.083
I'm just... I just want to drive
to a dispensary

22:04.166 --> 22:06.166
and buy some weed and smoke it.

22:06.250 --> 22:10.208
Is that allowed, to smoke weed if that
wasn't the thing you were addicted to?

22:10.333 --> 22:13.542
There's no such thing as "allowed"
in my program.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.417
There are just suggestions.

22:15.500 --> 22:19.542
And... no. It's not suggested.

22:19.625 --> 22:24.709
-Why not?
-Because if I smoked weed,

22:24.792 --> 22:28.500
it is very likely that I would forget
to not do heroin.

22:31.041 --> 22:32.125
Well...

22:33.208 --> 22:34.583
for the record...

22:36.166 --> 22:37.792
I would marry you in a hot minute.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.417
-Why?
-Because most drug addicts

22:41.500 --> 22:43.917
who crave drugs just do drugs.

22:44.709 --> 22:46.625
But you don't.

22:46.709 --> 22:49.291
That makes you stronger than most people.

22:49.917 --> 22:51.709
And cooler.

22:51.792 --> 22:54.834
And the opposite of self-destructive.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.375
So...

22:57.792 --> 22:58.667
[Link clears throat]

22:59.709 --> 23:01.667
All right. Amelia...

23:03.000 --> 23:05.625
-Oh, my God! No! Oh, my God! Get up!
-Got it.

23:07.291 --> 23:10.166
Like, not ever or not today?

23:10.250 --> 23:13.458
Just not when I'm confessing
my darkest secrets

23:13.542 --> 23:15.875
and I have snot running down my face.
[sniffling]

23:17.625 --> 23:18.917
Okay.

23:19.750 --> 23:22.125
-[Jo] Is Luna okay?
-Yeah. She's fine.

23:22.208 --> 23:24.875
I just needed to see a friendly face.

23:25.709 --> 23:29.083
I'm about to ask a father
about taking his baby off life support.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.875
Oh, my God.

23:31.333 --> 23:34.125
She's the best. She doesn't judge.

23:34.208 --> 23:35.667
Isn't selfish.

23:35.750 --> 23:38.959
Isn't bitter or resentful
about the cards she's been dealt.

23:39.709 --> 23:44.875
I hope she doesn't
become bitter or resentful.

23:44.959 --> 23:47.667
I wouldn't blame her if she did.

23:48.709 --> 23:52.917
I spent a lot of my life being angry
about the way I came into the world.

23:53.625 --> 23:57.208
It took me a long time to realize that
that anger didn't serve me.

23:57.709 --> 24:00.291
The more it I let go,
the better off I'd be.

24:01.125 --> 24:02.709
Letting it go was like...

24:03.500 --> 24:07.458
breaking off the crusty black pieces
of my heart that hurt

24:07.542 --> 24:09.333
at first, but...

24:09.417 --> 24:11.333
-With time...
-Wow, Wilson.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.500
-What?
-Thank you!

-Agreed. Pickups.

24:25.667 --> 24:29.834

24:36.375 --> 24:39.333
-How are the kids?
-You ask me, he's lucky.

24:39.417 --> 24:41.875
-How so?
-He found out the truth on day one

24:41.959 --> 24:43.834
instead of 20 years from now.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.208
No house. No kids. Lucky.

-Mayo scissors, please.
-And how is Altman?

24:49.333 --> 24:52.041
-Should be back in a couple days.
-That's not why I'm asking.

24:52.125 --> 24:57.000
Respectfully, Chief, the OR has heard
enough about my personal life. Okay?

24:57.083 --> 24:58.375
Mesh.

24:59.583 --> 25:01.083
Hayes, you paged again.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.375
You said there's not enough space
for a total artificial heart.

25:06.083 --> 25:09.709
You paged me 911
after I told you it was impossible?

25:09.792 --> 25:12.333
-His chest cavity is too small.
-I know.

25:12.417 --> 25:15.333
Too small because his heart's
taking up space.

25:15.417 --> 25:16.750
But what if we made space?

25:16.834 --> 25:20.333
-Sure, let's just take out his heart.
-Don't be ridiculous.

25:20.458 --> 25:22.291
We'll leave some of it behind.

25:32.375 --> 25:35.250
-You want to cut out part of his heart?
-The lower part.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.917
The ventricles,
which are not functioning properly.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.500
So the answer is yes.
You want to cut out part of his heart.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.875
To create space
for a total artificial heart pump

25:43.959 --> 25:45.458
to act in place of what we removed.

25:47.542 --> 25:48.959
Have you done this before?

25:49.041 --> 25:51.667
Because it sounds like
you haven't done it before.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.333
We have used the device on older children.

25:54.417 --> 25:57.375
But in those cases, we did not
have to remove both ventricles.

25:57.458 --> 26:00.875
So you could do this and it doesn't work?

26:02.208 --> 26:04.917
-Why would you even suggest...
- Because Arthur's chances of survival

26:05.000 --> 26:07.500
are exactly the same as
if we did absolutely nothing.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.792
I know this sounds insane.

26:09.875 --> 26:13.083
But we're running out of options.
And Arthur is almost out of time.

26:13.792 --> 26:15.625
You asked me to save your son. Yes?

26:15.709 --> 26:18.041
I'm telling you, this is his best chance.

26:19.375 --> 26:21.542
I need to call Hollie.

26:21.625 --> 26:23.458
She'll want to see him, before...

26:25.208 --> 26:28.083
-Just in case.
-Of course.

26:37.959 --> 26:40.417
Your surgery went better
than we could have hoped.

26:40.500 --> 26:44.083
Yep. You may have a couple months
rehab, but everything looks good.

26:44.166 --> 26:48.834
Months of rehab alone in an apartment
during a pandemic.

26:49.625 --> 26:55.166
Oh, so that's it? It's been what,
12 hours, and you're jumping ship?

26:55.250 --> 26:56.667
Bailey, maybe we should let them...

26:56.750 --> 27:00.375
Shayne, my parents were together
for over 60 years.

27:00.458 --> 27:04.000
After my mom passed, my dad and I
were going through their old photos

27:04.083 --> 27:08.667
looking for something
that we could post with her obituary.

27:08.750 --> 27:14.625
Sixty years is a lot of hair styles
and fashion trends.

27:15.166 --> 27:17.959
Finally, my dad told me
that I should just pick.

27:18.041 --> 27:20.208
Because when he looked at them,

27:20.291 --> 27:23.125
all he saw was the woman
he fell in love with.

27:23.834 --> 27:26.500
She was still the same caring, nurturing,

27:26.583 --> 27:30.917
kind-hearted person
she was the day they met.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.583
Look, people are who they are.

27:33.667 --> 27:36.333
Karissa said some things

27:36.417 --> 27:40.542
while you were trapped in a car
and she was terrified.

27:41.250 --> 27:43.208
But my guess is...

27:43.291 --> 27:46.750
she's still the same person
she was when you met.

27:47.667 --> 27:50.458
You might want to give her a chance
to prove that

27:50.542 --> 27:52.333
before you just throw it all away.

27:55.375 --> 27:57.417
Is there any way I can see her?

27:59.709 --> 28:00.917

Nobody's losing a room.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.166
She's gonna point me in the direction
of hotels

28:14.250 --> 28:17.458

without getting in anybody's way.

-No.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.750

28:37.542 --> 28:41.083

-Right. That's why I'm trying to help.

28:41.667 --> 28:43.166

36:57.500 --> 37:01.375
-You're dumping me over a peanut?
<i>-It's an example. </i><i>One of many.</i>

37:01.458 --> 37:03.709
You're the center of your own universe,

37:03.792 --> 37:06.166
and I'd rather be alone than with someone

37:06.250 --> 37:09.333
who isn't capable of
considering anyone but herself.

37:09.417 --> 37:13.291
-Well, now I feel terrible.
<i>-I'm sure it wont last long.</i>

37:14.875 --> 37:17.125
-Thank you.

[Meredith] <i>One way or the other</i>
<i>surgeons get closure </i><i>with their patients.</i>

37:20.917 --> 37:23.041
You got yourselves a feisty one here.

37:23.125 --> 37:26.709
He sailed through every hour of it.
Never showed any signs of giving up.

37:26.792 --> 37:28.208
My man.

37:28.291 --> 37:31.250
You're here. You're still here.

37:31.333 --> 37:34.792
-I've gotta call Hollie.
-Of course.

37:34.875 --> 37:37.792
[exclaiming] Honey, he's okay. He's okay.

37:38.834 --> 37:41.709
-And he's bionic.
-[Hollie crying]

37:41.792 --> 37:43.000
[Hayes] Just for a little while, Hollie.

37:43.083 --> 37:45.458
As soon as a donor heart comes up,
we'll remove the machine.

37:45.542 --> 37:48.959
Until then, Arthur's got
his very own little battery pack.

37:50.125 --> 37:52.500
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>

37:52.917 --> 37:55.291
<i>-Oh, my beautiful boy.</i>
-We're so proud of you.

37:55.375 --> 37:56.834
<i>Hi. Hi.</i>

37:58.458 --> 38:02.792
-You're a strong little guy.
<i>-Mommy loves you. We love you so much.</i>

38:03.083 --> 38:05.208
[Meredith]
<i>Sometimes we fix you, sometimes we can't.</i>

38:05.792 --> 38:08.667
[Schmit] Thanks for driving me.
I'm too tired to ride my bike.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.458
[Jo] Well, if I'm driving, you're cooking.

38:10.542 --> 38:13.750
[sighs] Who knew sticking things up
people's noses would be so exhausting?

38:13.834 --> 38:16.291
Wilson, you got a minute?

38:16.375 --> 38:18.333
Sure, yeah. What's-- What's up?

38:18.417 --> 38:20.250
I was hoping you could tell me.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.625
-About...?
-Quitting surgery.

38:24.417 --> 38:25.458
I'm just gonna...

38:27.583 --> 38:30.792
If you're serious about
changing specialties,

38:30.875 --> 38:32.875
I--I wanna support you, but...

38:32.959 --> 38:34.792
I can't do that if I'm in the dark.

38:36.625 --> 38:40.834
[Meredith] <i>But our intention</i>
<i>is to find a long-term solution.</i>

38:41.583 --> 38:44.125
[Link] Zola's reading for 20 minutes.

38:44.208 --> 38:50.000
And the others fell sleep before
the animals saw Toad's bathing suit.

38:50.709 --> 38:52.583
This guy's down.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.875
How long can your parents live
in the driveway?

38:57.041 --> 38:57.917
[sighs]

38:58.250 --> 39:01.375
So my mom can keep accidentally
referring to you as my wife?

39:01.667 --> 39:02.667
[chuckles]

39:05.959 --> 39:08.083
What if we just...

39:08.166 --> 39:09.583
do a check-in?

39:10.542 --> 39:13.750
Every few weeks, no judgment,

39:13.834 --> 39:16.333
to just make sure we're still good
with our decision?

39:18.875 --> 39:21.458
Are we super broken?

39:21.542 --> 39:23.959
Or are we super evolved?

39:24.834 --> 39:26.542
Oh, definitely evolved.

39:30.959 --> 39:33.959
[Meredith] <i>Which isn't to say</i>
<i>emergency medicine isn't important.</i>

39:34.834 --> 39:37.542
<i>Especially when something's gone neglected</i>
<i>too long.</i>

39:40.834 --> 39:44.542
Owen. I just... I just put the kids down.

39:44.625 --> 39:47.291
-I didn't know that you were...
-Actually, I came to see you.

39:49.917 --> 39:54.125
You tried to tell me the truth about
your relationship with Allison, and I...

39:55.667 --> 39:57.417
I was awful to you.

39:58.834 --> 40:00.041
And I'm sorry.

40:00.709 --> 40:02.750
[stuttering]
I should have told you years ago.

40:03.583 --> 40:07.041
You told me when you could.
And I should have been there for you.

40:07.125 --> 40:09.166
Because since the day we met, Teddy,

40:09.250 --> 40:11.959
every day since,
you have been there for me.

40:12.041 --> 40:15.583
You have listened to me.
You have fought for me.

40:15.667 --> 40:20.041
So that thing you did
on our [sighs] wedding day,

40:20.125 --> 40:21.709
-it was...
-I'm--I'm sorry.

40:21.792 --> 40:23.917
[Owen] I know. I know you are.

40:24.875 --> 40:28.542
We were friends first.
We've been friends for years.

40:28.625 --> 40:31.208
And you've never been anything
but there for me.

40:31.291 --> 40:35.166
So when you... when you did this thing
that was so out of character,

40:35.250 --> 40:38.375
I should have known that you were
going through something bigger than me.

40:40.041 --> 40:41.583
And that you just needed a friend.

40:42.709 --> 40:45.458
-Owen.
-I can be your friend.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.583
I want to be your friend.

40:47.667 --> 40:51.250
And I don't know
if I have more than that in me.

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
But I can be your friend,
if you'll let me, Teddy.

40:55.959 --> 40:58.834
And I'd like to hear about Allison,
if you'll tell me.

41:02.000 --> 41:06.166
-Do you want some tea?
-Yeah.

41:07.375 --> 41:08.917
Tea would be good.

41:27.208 --> 41:29.000
She's still mostly sleeping.

41:29.917 --> 41:31.583
She's listening.

41:32.417 --> 41:34.625
Even when you think maybe she's not...

41:35.417 --> 41:37.125
-she's...
-Extraordinary.
