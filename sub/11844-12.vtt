No one's been reported. I don't know
what she looks like. I don't have any leads.

00:08.341 --> 00:10.207
You know, your daddy
went down just like this.

00:10.276 --> 00:13.541
He got some fool notion into his head,
ignored the law and his friends...

00:13.613 --> 00:16.446
- and ended up handing over his badge.
- Is that a threat?

00:16.516 --> 00:20.214
I'm half tempted to have you thrown
in your own jail on a contempt citation.

00:20.286 --> 00:22.380

- [Turns On] - What's your relationship

24:44.181 --> 24:48.118

- <i>[</i> Tums 026' Recorder <i>]</i> - You hindered

Yeah, well, you wanna know what?
Isabel is great...

None of it is.

30:12.342 --> 30:15.437
Liz, you should
get to see Sweden.

30:19.516 --> 30:21.507
We-

30:22.986 --> 30:25.455
I hold you back.

30:28.291 --> 30:31.591
- No, Max. No, it's not true.
- Liz, you're right.

30:31.661 --> 30:34.460
Everyone we touch gets hurt
in some way or another.

30:38.702 --> 30:42.468
Five years from now, I don't want you
to open your eyes and realize that-

30:42.539 --> 30:44.598
that you missed out.

30:46.143 --> 30:48.111
You're a part of the group.

30:48.178 --> 30:50.408
You always will be.

30:51.548 --> 30:53.642
But you need to be allowed to-

30:55.452 --> 30:57.443
to grow.

31:07.364 --> 31:11.460
- Why can't you come with me?
- Because I can't.

31:11.535 --> 31:14.664
But I'll be watching you, Liz Parker.

31:14.738 --> 31:16.729
Wherever you go.

31:17.941 --> 31:20.009
And I'll be here
when you get back.

31:20.010 --> 31:20.033
And I'll be here
when you get back.

32:05.688 --> 32:08.316
- Kyle.
- Agent Duff.

32:09.759 --> 32:11.818
- You shouldn't be in here.
- I know, uh...

32:11.895 --> 32:14.330
my dad's supposed
to sign my report card.

32:14.397 --> 32:18.732
- I gave it to him a week ago. It's
clue tomorrow. - You're sure it's here?

32:18.802 --> 32:21.464
Should be, yeah.

32:24.541 --> 32:27.511
What are you really looking for, Kyle?

32:30.747 --> 32:33.978
- Here it is. Right in front of me.
- Let's see how you're doing.

32:47.730 --> 32:50.995
I didn't like trigonometry, either.

33:09.185 --> 33:12.780
- Oh! What are you doing here? - Well, you
know, I figured you might need a little help.

33:12.856 --> 33:15.621
- Don't ever use your mind freeze-
- Warp.

33:15.692 --> 33:19.720
Whatever. Your creepy powers on me again.
All right? Off limits.

33:19.796 --> 33:23.096
You know, a simple “Thanks for
saving my butt“ would be quite sufficient.

33:23.166 --> 33:25.533

34:06.643 --> 34:08.702
What's wrong?

34:09.746 --> 34:12.476
They fired Sheriff Valenti.

34:14.350 --> 34:19.481
- No.
- They can't. They can't just fire a sheriff.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.547
They can if they're the city council.

34:29.799 --> 34:34.293
In the past year, my dad and I have been put
through an amazing amount of your crap.

to put ourselves on the line for you.

34:58.027 --> 35:00.052
I can't.

35:33.296 --> 35:35.355
So how do we figure out what this is?

35:40.670 --> 35:42.866
Hey, paging the Evans.

35:42.939 --> 35:45.135
What's Valenti going to do?

35:45.208 --> 35:48.371
You know, it's not like he canjust go
and be sheriff somewhere else.

35:48.444 --> 35:50.378
He gave up everything for us.

35:50.446 --> 35:53.108
He gave up a crappy job
with low pay and long hours.

35:53.182 --> 35:55.981
- Michael.
- What?

35:56.052 --> 36:00.080
We were born into this cause;
Valenti chose it.

36:00.156 --> 36:02.215
Let what he did
be worth something.

36:02.292 --> 36:04.693
I thinkl have
an old microscope in the closet.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.534
We know what our cells look like.

some similarities.
