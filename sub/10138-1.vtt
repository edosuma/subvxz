We have to find it.
It's gonna start soon.

00:08.108 --> 00:11.408

even checked the lint trap. Nothing.

- Hey, guys, good
news. ALL: You found it?

00:13.780 --> 00:16.909
Nope, but I found this
bear claw in my slipper.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.078
It's not outside. It
just disappeared.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.655
Well, we checked all the
boys' secret hiding places.

It's official. The
remote is lost.

Fine.

You know, one of us could just walk
over to the TV and hit the power button.

No way.

it. D.J.: Good boy, Comet.

Quick. On, boy.

01:40.801 --> 01:45.102
All right, let's do that funky
thing. Two, three, four...

01:49.776 --> 01:52.041
This is great. You guys
might not recognize it...

01:52.212 --> 01:53.544
but that's "Satisfaction."

01:53.714 --> 01:57.344
Hey, Jess. You might not recognize
it, but we're trying to rehearse here.

01:57.517 --> 02:00.009
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Hey, boys?
Listen to your Uncle Gary.

02:00.187 --> 02:03.487
If you wanna grow up and be good,
strong musicians, you gotta rehearse.

Let's practice that Mick Jagger
thing we've been doing. Let's see it.

the lip, they got the stance...

I hate to interrupt...

02:26.513 --> 02:29.779
but which of these swizzle sticks
do you want for the Smash Club?

02:29.950 --> 02:33.182
Sorry, guys. When you own a
club, as I do, every decision is critical.

02:33.353 --> 02:36.255
I mean, even the swizzle
stick is a science kind of thing.

02:36.423 --> 02:39.791
I mean, it's gotta be durable,
stirrable. It's gotta set the right mood.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.555

a end-of-the-summer

still be fun. Why don't you all come?

but do I gotta rub them?

but I'm breaking up with him.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.192
I just don't feel any
chemistry between us.

And if I don't end it now, I'm
just gonna be leading him on.

Well, can't you just lead him on
to the yacht for one more party?

stay with a guy...

ATM in his living room.

back to rubbing poor people.

You're absolutely right.

gig next weekend as a solo artist.

singer-slash-songwriter.

and slash sing it.

that if he doesn't drop those hot dogs...

Jesse, did you give Michelle
permission to walk Comet by herself?

15:08.441 --> 15:11.275
Course not. I remember
exactly what happened.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.879
I was on the phone, kind of
busy, she was bugging me.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.481
She said, "Can I
walk Comet?" And I...

15:19.485 --> 15:22.216
I'm an idiot. Ah!

15:25.925 --> 15:28.690
MICHELLE: Stop.
Stop the car. There it is.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.294
D.J.: Come on, guys. Let's go.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.766
Where there's a wiener,
there's a hungry dog.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.906
Comet's gotta be
around here somewhere.

15:41.073 --> 15:43.668
STEPH: Comet!
- Here, boy!

15:43.843 --> 15:46.039
Michelle, I'm really
sorry I didn't believe you.

15:46.212 --> 15:50.274
That's okay. Once I lied to
you, and you did believe me.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.947
Hey, twerp, are you sure
that's the car you saw?

15:54.120 --> 15:58.558
No, Kimmy, there's millions of
giant hot dogs driving around.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.590
Well, that's gonna make
our job even tougher.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.993
- Comet!
- Here, boy.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.157
- Here, boy. Over here.
- Over here.

16:08.334 --> 16:09.597
- I've got something.
- Hey.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.967
- Got food for you.
- Here, boy!

16:13.372 --> 16:17.002
- Hey, boy.
- Comet.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.052
JOEY: Hey, Jess, pull over.

16:36.395 --> 16:39.593
- Why are we at Coit Tower?
- I take Comet for walks up here.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.462
Maybe he came back. I'm
just trying to think like a dog.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.961
The last time you did
that, you bit the mailman.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.801
He was teasing me.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.968
We don't have time
for this, biscuit-brain.

16:52.144 --> 16:54.272
Every second, the dog's
getting further away...

16:54.447 --> 16:56.541
and Michelle's gonna
hate me more and more.

16:56.716 --> 17:00.517
Oh, well, compared to Danny,
Michelle's gonna be a love fest.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.949
Danny, that's right.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.420
He's down at the Wharf
doing a remote with Becky.

17:04.589 --> 17:05.955
What are we gonna tell him?

17:06.259 --> 17:09.252
We're not gonna tell him
anything. You're gonna tell him.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.222
Daddy, look. Up there.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.561
Yeah, I know, boys.
It's a giant tower.

17:16.002 --> 17:19.905
If we wanna find Comet, we're gonna
have to look for a giant fire hydrant.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.244
NICKY: Dada. ALEX: Dada.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.585
I'm Rebecca Donaldson.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.754
And I guess that would
make me Danny Tanner.

17:44.931 --> 17:48.333
And this is a special, afternoon
edition of <i>Wake Up, San Francisco.</i>

17:48.501 --> 17:51.164
So I guess it's more like <i>How
Was Lunch, San Francisco?</i>

17:51.337 --> 17:55.297
We're live at Aquatic Park, near
Fisherman's Wharf, for a special report...

17:55.474 --> 17:59.343
on one of San Francisco's most
unique and entertaining assets:

17:59.512 --> 18:02.175
- Its street performers.
JESSE: Hey, Danny.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.919
Sorry. Listen, Danny,
we have a problem.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.486
- Cut.
- Danny, we can't cut.

18:08.654 --> 18:11.681
We're live at Aquatic Park.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.382
Uncut.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.154
Listen, before I say
anything, I want you to know...

18:16.329 --> 18:18.195
this whole thing was my fault.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.595
I hate stories
that start like that.

18:20.766 --> 18:22.257
Uh, well...

18:22.435 --> 18:27.601
why don't we have a nice, long look
over here at Rollo, the Human Mannequin?

18:27.773 --> 18:31.005
Maybe he'll move. Let's watch.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.542
This better be important. The Bay
Area is waiting for a man to blink.

18:34.714 --> 18:40.119
I know. Listen, I, uh... I let
Michelle walk Comet by herself...

18:40.286 --> 18:41.879
and he ran away.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.649
What? Little girl, big dog?
What's the matter with you?

18:44.824 --> 18:47.487
I know, I totally blew it.
I'm completely irresponsible.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.255
I'm totally negligent. I...

18:50.463 --> 18:51.795
What are you smiling at?

18:52.131 --> 18:55.863
He's smiling because
we're still live at Aquatic Park.

18:56.035 --> 18:59.665
Yes, that's right, Rebecca, and as
much as we all love watching Rollo age...

18:59.839 --> 19:01.467
I would like to make a plea...

19:01.641 --> 19:05.442
to the viewers who haven't switched
over to <i>Uncle Kenny's Cartoon Carnival.</i>

19:05.611 --> 19:09.104
I've just been notified that our
family dog, Comet, is missing.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.807
Dad. Dad, Comet is missing.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.577
I've just been notified again.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.985
He was chasing a giant hot dog.
At first, I didn't believe Michelle...

19:17.156 --> 19:20.888
but it's okay, because I owed her from
a time she lied, and I did believe her.

19:22.361 --> 19:26.628
Well, you never know what's gonna
happen here, live, at Aquatic Park.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.495
We're live?

19:28.668 --> 19:31.001
Oh, I hate this dress.

Hi, I'm Kimmy Gibbler.

19:33.239 --> 19:37.870
I like long walks on the beach,
sunsets and men covered with gravy.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.341
Folks, if you find
a golden retriever...

19:40.513 --> 19:44.541
light brown, medium build,
he's got a black, wet nose that...

19:44.717 --> 19:46.652
Well, it feels kind
of cold and tingly...

19:46.819 --> 19:49.516
when he, you know, presses
it up against your bare feet.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.557
Sometimes he'll stick his tongue
right between your toes and...

19:52.725 --> 19:55.422
Joey, that's a little more than
we need to know. Thank you.

19:55.594 --> 19:59.156
Folks, if you've ever lost your
dog, you know how we feel.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.924
He answers to the
name of Comet...

20:01.100 --> 20:04.764
although if he really answered to that,
he would've come when we called him.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.338
His name's on his dog tag.
Our phone number's on it.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.998
Please call, 24 hours
a day, we'll be there.

20:10.176 --> 20:13.044
Michelle, honey, is there
anything you'd like to add, sweetie?

20:14.080 --> 20:16.345
Comet, if you're lost, remember:

20:16.515 --> 20:20.350
We live on Gerard Street, right
next to your favorite hydrant.

20:20.519 --> 20:24.149
Gee, boy. I hope you're not
out there scared and alone...

20:24.323 --> 20:26.315
<i>because we love
you and miss you...</i>

20:26.492 --> 20:29.951
<i>and we want you to come home
as soon as you can, okay, boy?</i>

20:49.648 --> 20:53.016
- Hey, shorty, how you doing?
- I miss Comet.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.517
Yeah, we all do.

20:54.687 --> 20:58.021
Remember how he used to
chew on his rubber pork chop?

20:58.190 --> 20:59.886
[SQUEAKS]

21:00.059 --> 21:03.052
It's not the same
without slobber.

21:04.530 --> 21:08.934
Why did you let me walk Comet
alone? What were you thinking?

21:12.338 --> 21:16.571
Well, that's the problem,
Michelle. I wasn't thinking.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.278
You know, I was so hurt
by this Rippers thing...

21:19.445 --> 21:23.610
that all I could think about was showing
them up, proving I didn't need them.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.844
And I didn't listen to them. They
were absolutely right, you know?

21:27.019 --> 21:30.114
I did kind of lose my
passion for the music.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.986
And then what happened,
right? I let you walk Comet.

21:33.159 --> 21:36.152
You could've been pulled out
in the streets, could've been hurt.

21:36.328 --> 21:41.164
Uncle Jesse, I'm okay. I'm
just worried about Comet.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.030
I know. We all are.

21:45.204 --> 21:47.673
I'm really sorry, shorty.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.004
It's okay, Uncle Jesse.

21:56.081 --> 21:58.949
- What if Comet never comes home?
- Oh, Comet's gonna come home.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.519
I'm gonna plaster these
posters all over the city...

22:01.687 --> 22:04.727
and I'm gonna go out and look for
him, night and day, until he comes back.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.051
[TOY SQUEAKING]

22:06.225 --> 22:09.059
I miss him so much, I
can still hear his pork chop.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.993
Hm. So can I.

22:13.299 --> 22:18.260
- I can see him too.
- Me too. Comet, you came back.

back. STEPH: Comet.
