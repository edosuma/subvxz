00:48.152 --> 00:49.785
As a kid I watched my dad

00:49.787 --> 00:52.123
show the Salvadoran coffee
farmers how to survive

00:52.125 --> 00:55.561
by streamlining their harvest
to become profitable.

00:57.629 --> 01:00.298
We were some of the last
Americans to leave El Salvador

01:00.300 --> 01:02.403
when the Civil War broke out.

01:51.324 --> 01:52.823
Our friends Hector
and Milagra

01:52.825 --> 01:55.894
watched their farm
become a battleground.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.441
Hector disappeared that day.

02:42.748 --> 02:45.849
El Salvador is
in the midst of the gravest crisis

02:45.851 --> 02:47.517
in their history.

02:47.519 --> 02:50.455
Thousands of Salvadorian
civilians have been killed

02:50.457 --> 02:53.259
and millions more could be
affected by armed guerrillas

02:53.261 --> 02:55.660
supported by Cuba
and the Soviet Union.

02:55.662 --> 02:57.296
Holly, maybe we shouldn't
let Rob watch this.

02:57.298 --> 02:59.797
Are Hector and Milagra
okay, Dad?

02:59.799 --> 03:02.569
No idea. Haven't heard
from them in two weeks.

03:02.571 --> 03:05.571
- Who are they?
- They supply our Salvadoran coffee.

03:05.573 --> 03:07.673
Hector's wife
Milagra and son Ricardo

03:07.675 --> 03:09.310
were left to keep
the farm running.

03:09.312 --> 03:11.512
The United States
was to help to stop

03:11.514 --> 03:14.982
the advancement of communism
in Central America.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.706
Milagra took in
a few war-orphaned children,

03:36.708 --> 03:39.712
offering them a job
and a home.

03:52.627 --> 03:53.926
I can't do it.

03:53.928 --> 03:56.896
You got this.

04:07.544 --> 04:09.043
Hey, Mom.

04:09.045 --> 04:12.417
Ironically,
that's when I lost my mom, too.

04:15.052 --> 04:17.820
Holly, take Rob and wait
for me in the back.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.391
Come on, let's go.

04:22.027 --> 04:23.860
I need a lot of money.

04:27.432 --> 04:28.866
Kids need their mom.

04:28.868 --> 04:32.469
You got this.

04:43.985 --> 04:44.987
See ya.

05:04.740 --> 05:08.346
- Will she be back?
- No, not this time.

05:10.848 --> 05:12.515
This bean's
from Papua New Guinea.

05:12.517 --> 05:14.450
These indigenous farmers
are something else.

05:14.452 --> 05:16.586
This is the only farm
in the world

05:16.588 --> 05:19.889
where they grind the bean out of the
coffee cherry and river rock by hand.

05:19.891 --> 05:21.191
The owner's name's Otello.

05:21.193 --> 05:22.925
We're working
getting him Internet.

05:22.927 --> 05:24.130
Give it a taste.

05:26.966 --> 05:29.200
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

05:29.202 --> 05:31.101
Fruity. Sort of.

05:31.103 --> 05:34.439
Ethiopian.
Birthplace of coffee.

05:34.441 --> 05:36.107
Seven years ago,
militants took over the farm

05:36.109 --> 05:38.710
and our friends didn't
get back until last year.

05:38.712 --> 05:41.113
We helped them set up a fair trade
co-op and now they're thriving.

05:41.115 --> 05:42.517
To Ethiopia.

05:43.785 --> 05:46.519
And Salvadoran.

05:46.521 --> 05:48.158
These guys are like family.

05:52.829 --> 05:54.094
Mm-hmm.

05:54.096 --> 05:55.565
Here.

06:00.170 --> 06:02.470
This is me.

06:02.472 --> 06:05.741
Before my dad passed, every year he
used to take me down to harvest.

06:05.743 --> 06:07.609
- To El Salvador?
- Yeah.

06:07.611 --> 06:10.111
- Wasn't that dangerous?
- Well, I'm sure he was there with her

06:10.113 --> 06:11.881
- the entire time.
- Holly.

06:11.883 --> 06:14.650
- Ally's on Skype for you.
- That's my daughter calling.

06:14.652 --> 06:17.821
- From El Salvador.
- Hey, Rob, can you help Carlos unload the truck?

06:17.823 --> 06:19.656
And can you make sure count
before we sign this time?

06:19.658 --> 06:23.094
- I always count.
- Mason, I promised Mikey our tasty Nicaragua.

06:23.096 --> 06:25.031
- Dark?
- Black.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.669
Jesus, Rob.

06:32.873 --> 06:34.172
Hey, Mom.

06:34.174 --> 06:36.242
- Hey, sweetie. Happy Tuesday.
- Thanks.

06:36.244 --> 06:38.545
- Is everything good?
- Just tell her.

06:38.547 --> 06:40.947
- Uncle Rob!
- What's up? Is your report almost finished?

06:40.949 --> 06:44.185
I'm waiting for Ricardo
to send me the soil analysis.

06:44.187 --> 06:46.921
Milagra's guy finally sent me the numbers.
They're in the positive.

06:46.923 --> 06:50.590
Hey, O.I.T. called and they want
your report before orientation.

06:50.592 --> 06:54.196
I just... I need more data.
I haven't really started.

06:54.198 --> 06:56.131
Ally, you need to
take this seriously.

06:56.133 --> 06:58.533
This course is your in
to a full ride.

06:58.535 --> 07:00.837
I know, Mom.

07:00.839 --> 07:03.572
She doesn't want to go.
Jesus, would you just... Really?

07:03.574 --> 07:05.942
- Wow.
- Who's this Laura girl?

07:05.944 --> 07:07.543
Laura, come here.
Come here.

07:07.545 --> 07:11.248
- Meet my mom.
- ¡Hola! Hello!

07:11.250 --> 07:14.051
- And where'd you come from?
- El Salvador.

07:14.053 --> 07:16.855
Uh, she's a neighbor.

07:16.857 --> 07:19.757
Both her parents headed up there
for work and Milagra took her in.

07:19.759 --> 07:21.226
Ally, tell Milagra I'll
be there on Monday, okay?

07:21.228 --> 07:23.595
Have Ricardo come pick me up
from the airport.

07:23.597 --> 07:26.097
I'd like you to come with me
to the fair trade convention.

07:26.099 --> 07:29.171
- Do I have to?
- Yeah, I want to see you. I miss you.

10:08.215 --> 10:10.181
Laura?

10:10.183 --> 10:11.183
Laura, wake up.

10:11.185 --> 10:13.386
¿Que pasa?

10:13.388 --> 10:14.921
It's Milagra.
She's in trouble.

10:21.164 --> 10:23.531
They said something
about money. Who are they?

10:23.533 --> 10:25.034
I don't know.

11:00.208 --> 11:02.077
They're coming for us.

11:29.206 --> 11:30.941
Shh.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.375
Rob, will you answer that?

12:32.377 --> 12:35.212
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

12:41.086 --> 12:42.355
Drew's Brews.

12:58.307 --> 13:00.544
Hey, what's up?

13:02.211 --> 13:03.280
Holly?

13:07.283 --> 13:08.582
Yo, dude?

13:08.584 --> 13:11.086
I'll be there at 10 am.

13:11.088 --> 13:12.991
Okay. Bye.

13:14.190 --> 13:15.561
What's going on?

13:17.662 --> 13:19.965
Ally's been kidnapped.
Let's go!

13:22.032 --> 13:23.566
I don't care if you
lay someone on the tarmac,

13:23.568 --> 13:25.401
you do not take off
without me, got it?

13:25.403 --> 13:27.671
20 minutes. Hurry, Rob.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.706
- Really?
- Well, yeah.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.310
Yeah. Under the circumstances,
this seems terribly appropriate.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.046
I don't know why you're not letting me
go with you. I should be going with you.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.349
You gotta keep the shop open
and be my relay.

13:37.351 --> 13:40.152
We can't close the shop for a few days?
It's ridiculous.

13:40.154 --> 13:42.654
I need you here.
Rob, I've got this.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.358
I don't feel good about this.
I'm telling you that right now.

14:09.253 --> 14:11.587
What do we know? Gangs?
Do we owe money? What?

14:11.589 --> 14:14.159
- I don't know.
- Well, do we know who these men are?

14:15.727 --> 14:18.061
Do you know these men?

14:18.063 --> 14:19.663
They wore masks.

14:19.665 --> 14:22.198
Rob called the embassy.
They're expecting us now.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.135
- How many hours has it been?
- 10 or so.

14:25.137 --> 14:27.007
What time exactly
did it happen?

14:28.408 --> 14:29.743
We called you right after.

14:31.277 --> 14:33.313
12 hours, 35 minutes.

14:37.351 --> 14:38.754
Passport?

14:42.557 --> 14:44.027
This way, please.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.169
- Miss Drew?
- Yeah.

14:55.171 --> 14:56.773
Frank Richards. This way.

15:01.079 --> 15:03.511
What do we know?
Is this Los Discípulos Gang?

15:03.513 --> 15:05.380
More than likely.
Please, have a seat.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.350
They run extortion rings
with a lot of the farms

15:07.352 --> 15:08.654
down in San Bartolomé
Perulapía.

15:10.489 --> 15:13.122
- They wore masks.
- What about anything

15:13.124 --> 15:14.390
that would
tell you who they were?

15:14.392 --> 15:16.263
Did they make
any gang gestures?

15:17.831 --> 15:21.165
- No.
- Did you recognize their voices?

15:21.167 --> 15:22.636
What about
any distinguishing tattoos?

15:24.572 --> 15:28.607
- No.
- Are you sure?

15:28.609 --> 15:32.345
What's concerning to me is that they
will usually stick to their word.

15:32.347 --> 15:34.480
If you pay, this sort of
thing doesn't happen.

15:34.482 --> 15:36.850
And the fact that they took
your daughter, an American,

15:36.852 --> 15:39.352
tells me these guys
aren't playing by the rules.

15:39.354 --> 15:41.621
What will they do with them?

15:41.623 --> 15:46.793
El Salvador is a supply zone
for human trafficking.

15:46.795 --> 15:49.631
They will probably try to sell
them to Mexican traffickers,

15:49.633 --> 15:52.534
and they will end up there
or in the U.S.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.269
Now, don't worry.

15:54.271 --> 15:55.771
I already put a call in
to the government's

15:55.773 --> 15:58.241
inter-agency
trafficking task force.

15:58.243 --> 16:01.710
These guys are top notch,
and they're expecting you now.

16:01.712 --> 16:03.846
Time is critical.

16:03.848 --> 16:06.249
The longer they're gone,
the less our chances.

16:06.251 --> 16:07.654
Vamanos!

16:15.227 --> 16:18.296
Los Discípulos Gang started
from Salvadorian war refugees

16:18.298 --> 16:20.298
in Los Angeles in the '80s.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.601
The U.S. deported
the violent ones

16:22.603 --> 16:25.236
and now they're our problem,
and yours.

16:25.238 --> 16:28.742
They're the ones trafficking
girls into your country.

16:28.744 --> 16:31.844
- Do you think these guys took my daughter?
- It's hard to tell.

16:31.846 --> 16:34.548
- Have they tried contacting you?
- No.

16:34.550 --> 16:37.384
- They probably will.
- What if they don't?

16:37.386 --> 16:40.754
- I think you're getting ahead of yourself.
- Really?

16:40.756 --> 16:43.258
- Will they prostitute her?
- Pardon me.

16:43.260 --> 16:47.495
I'm sorry, are we
keeping you up?

16:47.497 --> 16:51.333
I mean, it's siesta time. Maybe we
should just take a couple hours off.

16:51.335 --> 16:53.503
I mean, seriously,
what do you even do all day?

16:53.505 --> 16:55.441
We mostly run awareness campaigns.
We can't invest...

16:58.209 --> 17:00.843
Someone saw something.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.446
Someone knows where they went!

17:02.448 --> 17:04.849
- I understand how you feel.
- No, you don't.

17:06.284 --> 17:07.887
I'm going to get
my daughter back.

17:10.690 --> 17:13.223
Miss Drew, wait!

17:13.226 --> 17:14.628
I know somebody
who might help.

17:18.398 --> 17:20.569
He's, what you would say...

17:21.935 --> 17:24.174
unconventional.

17:35.951 --> 17:37.718
Let me talk, okay?

17:37.720 --> 17:38.822
We'll need cash.

17:41.258 --> 17:43.327
No, no, no.
It's not enough.

18:18.633 --> 18:19.703
Are you Fern?

18:21.470 --> 18:23.703
I was sent here by the police.

18:23.705 --> 18:26.709
They told me
you get things done.

18:37.655 --> 18:40.759
- Who are you?
- Holly Drew.

18:42.526 --> 18:44.026
My daughter and her friend
were kidnapped

18:44.028 --> 18:45.728
and I was told you
could help get them back.

18:45.730 --> 18:48.631
- Do you have money?
- Not much.

18:48.633 --> 18:53.473
Ah, then you...
you give me sex, huh?

19:01.515 --> 19:02.684
Okay.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.386
If your white daughter

19:07.388 --> 19:09.922
was taken by
Los Discípulos,

19:09.924 --> 19:11.924
she will be half way
to Guatemala,

19:11.926 --> 19:15.496
half-drugged
and raped along the way.

19:15.498 --> 19:18.835
Or if she's lucky,
she's dead.

19:21.371 --> 19:25.643
- Where in Guatemala?
- Did anyone see who took her?

19:27.610 --> 19:31.446
- No.
- Then she could be anywhere in Guatemala.

19:31.448 --> 19:34.049
- Where do we start?
- No, no, no, no.

19:34.051 --> 19:38.856
You start on the only road
that goes there.

19:38.858 --> 19:41.825
My daughter and her friend,
who lives with that woman,

19:41.827 --> 19:44.030
were taken from her farm
in San Bartolomé.

19:47.434 --> 19:49.870
Buenas noches, Holly girl.

19:51.103 --> 19:52.672
Please.

19:56.444 --> 19:59.481
You know what's worse than sitting
on your ass when you could help?

20:27.913 --> 20:29.647
Stop!

22:24.142 --> 22:26.144
We'll find them.

22:30.283 --> 22:31.651
We'll find them.

22:37.024 --> 22:38.793
No one saw...

22:40.160 --> 22:41.696
anything?

22:56.211 --> 22:59.182
Um, I might have
seen something.

23:03.921 --> 23:04.923
Come on.

23:49.139 --> 23:50.774
Ah, you.

23:59.883 --> 24:03.919
I trusted you with my daughter
and you lied to me.

24:03.921 --> 24:05.721
They'd kill me if I talked.

24:08.392 --> 24:10.827
You valued your life over
Ally's and Laura's,

24:10.829 --> 24:13.197
- you selfish coward.
- These are bad people, Holly.

24:13.199 --> 24:17.034
72 people were found beheaded
under an overpass in Mexico.

24:17.036 --> 24:18.334
Los Discípulos did it.

24:21.075 --> 24:24.042
Hello? Rob? Yeah.

24:24.044 --> 24:28.047
We don't know exactly where.
Somewhere in Guatemala.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.950
Rob, I need you to call
the Guatemalan Embassy.

24:30.952 --> 24:34.252
Tell them what's happened
and give them my cell number.

24:34.254 --> 24:36.256
Hello? Rob?

24:39.427 --> 24:42.429
- Have you got service?
- Mother has my phone.

24:42.431 --> 24:45.803
I don't know if he heard me
say to call the embassy.

24:50.339 --> 24:52.742
How far to
the Guatemalan border?

24:52.744 --> 24:54.279
A couple of hours.

26:17.905 --> 26:21.544
- What are you doing?
- You dropped your phone.

26:31.987 --> 26:33.286
What's this?

26:33.288 --> 26:35.359
Checkpoint.

26:41.532 --> 26:43.233
Where are we?

26:43.235 --> 26:46.201
We entered Guatemala
an hour ago.

26:46.203 --> 26:48.071
Well, the girls must have
passed through here.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.240
The cops might have them.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.575
I don't know.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.480
I'll go see what they know.

29:33.091 --> 29:34.458
Hello?

29:34.460 --> 29:36.626
Rob! They murdered him
and they're chasing me!

29:36.628 --> 29:38.229
- What?
- Rob! The police!

29:38.231 --> 29:39.830
Ricardo, they shot him!

29:39.832 --> 29:42.534
Robbie, you have to help me!
Rob, they killed him!

29:42.536 --> 29:44.803
- Oh, my God!
- Call the Guatemalan Embassy.

29:44.805 --> 29:48.206
I did! I called them. They said they
needed Ally and Laura's picture.

29:48.208 --> 29:49.841
- Holly? Hello?
- Rob?

29:49.843 --> 29:51.379
Hol...

32:31.692 --> 32:33.228
Miss Drew.

32:35.664 --> 32:37.667
How you doing?

32:42.472 --> 32:43.540
Up, up, up, up, up.

32:50.948 --> 32:55.016
For a woman,
you're a very good driver.

32:55.018 --> 32:56.253
What is this?

32:58.823 --> 33:01.860
I changed my mind.
I want to help.

33:06.431 --> 33:07.730
How did you find me?

33:07.732 --> 33:10.034
I never lost you.

33:10.036 --> 33:13.370
Fortunately,
the police did.

33:13.372 --> 33:14.639
For now.

33:14.641 --> 33:17.342
- They killed my friend.
- Yes.

33:17.344 --> 33:19.643
He told them you were
looking for the girls.

33:19.645 --> 33:24.250
- What's wrong with that?
- Those are the wrong police.

33:24.918 --> 33:25.920
Come.

33:27.321 --> 33:28.756
Come.

33:36.098 --> 33:39.634
Wait, so you're saying the girls passed
through here and the cops knew about it?

33:39.636 --> 33:40.801
That's the only reason
to kill him,

33:40.803 --> 33:43.637
to erase the trail.

33:43.639 --> 33:46.442
The good news is, now we
know where they are going.

33:46.444 --> 33:49.914
The bad news is, we have to pass
through the next roadblock.

33:53.850 --> 33:56.118
What's all this?

33:56.120 --> 33:59.489
These, my dear,
are party favors.

33:59.491 --> 34:01.124
They make me
many good friends.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.763
Now, please, get in.

34:05.063 --> 34:06.363
They're not loaded.

34:06.365 --> 34:09.632
No way.

34:09.634 --> 34:12.838
Miss Drew, it's the only way
to get past the police.

34:12.840 --> 34:14.706
How do I know
you won't kill me?

34:14.708 --> 34:16.376
I might.

34:18.812 --> 34:20.645
Ay, Dios.
Seriously, please.

34:20.647 --> 34:24.683
If you stay here,
you will die.

34:24.685 --> 34:28.021
A lone white woman
in the jungle of Guatemala

34:28.023 --> 34:32.159
hunted by corrupt police?

34:32.161 --> 34:35.366
And you already know what they are
capable of when they find you.

34:37.801 --> 34:40.033
Okay, you stay here.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.338
Wait!

34:52.885 --> 34:56.018
Okay. Please.
Come, come, come.

34:56.021 --> 34:58.722
It's going to be fine.
It's going to be fine.

34:58.724 --> 35:00.828
Put your head here, please.

35:02.561 --> 35:04.732
Feet down.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.070
Oh!

35:43.941 --> 35:45.641
What the hell?

35:45.643 --> 35:47.743
Hey, there's
a grenade in here!

35:47.745 --> 35:50.849
Quiet please, Holly. Quiet.

36:39.671 --> 36:42.242
Turn off,
please, flashlight.

40:33.935 --> 40:36.305
We're safe.
Come. Come out.

41:16.616 --> 41:20.083
So, Raul?

41:20.085 --> 41:21.953
Your friend?

41:21.955 --> 41:25.256
Brother? Roommate?

41:25.258 --> 41:28.926
Raul and I,
we are survivors.

41:28.928 --> 41:32.465
I have known him
since he was a little boy.

41:32.467 --> 41:35.971
We were both starved,
angry orphans.

41:36.971 --> 41:38.374
You were an orphan?

41:42.177 --> 41:44.814
I was a child
of the Civil War.

41:56.494 --> 41:59.997
But a family
take me in for a while.

42:01.298 --> 42:03.900
Those were innocent times.

42:03.902 --> 42:05.504
But not my heart.

42:08.973 --> 42:11.208
I joined the military
when I was 14,

42:11.210 --> 42:12.510
and eventually was in charge

42:12.512 --> 42:15.046
of distributing
the military aid

42:15.048 --> 42:18.149
that my government received
from foreign countries.

42:18.151 --> 42:21.620
Including yours, Holly Drew.
Los Estados Unidos.

42:21.622 --> 42:26.192
- You're not still in the military?
- No.

42:26.194 --> 42:28.063
I did what I had to do
and I got out.

42:30.065 --> 42:31.900
Your parents...

42:33.235 --> 42:34.605
they were murdered?

42:39.008 --> 42:40.910
Did you find those
responsible?

42:43.346 --> 42:45.282
Indeed, I did.

42:57.262 --> 42:58.899
And what is it you do now?

43:02.201 --> 43:05.235
I do things for my government,
that for whatever reason,

43:05.237 --> 43:07.671
no one else can do.

43:07.673 --> 43:11.575
And maybe sell weapons
that you stockpiled

43:11.577 --> 43:13.545
during the Civil War?

43:15.683 --> 43:19.288
Who are you, Holly Drew?
Who are you?

43:27.729 --> 43:29.730
What is that?

43:29.732 --> 43:31.399
A text from my brother.

43:31.401 --> 43:34.134
I sent him a photo of the girls
to send to the embassy.

43:34.136 --> 43:38.307
My dear, we do not know
who the embassy talks to.

43:38.309 --> 43:39.711
We have to be careful.

43:42.480 --> 43:44.014
This is my daughter Ally.

43:48.153 --> 43:49.722
She is very pretty.

43:51.622 --> 43:54.791
And what was she doing
all alone in El Salvador?

43:54.793 --> 43:57.594
Same thing I was doing
in El Salvador at her age,

43:57.596 --> 44:00.764
except she's doing it
to get into college.

44:00.766 --> 44:03.003
Ah, so she's pretty
and smart.

44:04.303 --> 44:06.303
And stubborn.

44:06.305 --> 44:09.307
She doesn't want to go to college.
At least not that college.

44:09.309 --> 44:11.476
She's been fighting me
every step of the way.

44:11.478 --> 44:15.984
Yes, but at some point she has
to be her own person, no?

44:18.720 --> 44:21.055
And this other one,
who is she?

44:21.057 --> 44:23.823
Laura. She was also taken.

44:23.825 --> 44:26.428
From the farm of Milagra.

44:26.430 --> 44:30.832
- Did I tell you her name?
- I suppose so, I...

44:30.834 --> 44:33.234
Text me this photo
so I can send it ahead.

44:33.236 --> 44:34.669
How did you know her name?

44:42.547 --> 44:43.649
What is it?

44:46.752 --> 44:47.754
What is it?

44:49.154 --> 44:51.421
- Tell me.
- We are getting closer

44:51.423 --> 44:53.391
- to knowing where the girls are.
- Where?

44:53.393 --> 44:55.592
They're in Guatemala City
in a brothel.

44:55.594 --> 44:58.696
- They're going to call me soon with a name.
- A brothel.

44:58.698 --> 45:02.700
These men, Holly, they will make as
much money off of them as they can.

45:02.702 --> 45:05.205
- And then they will sell them.
- How far is it?

45:06.541 --> 45:08.440
Four hours in a brothel.

45:08.442 --> 45:10.742
Ally, she is...
she is just a girl.

45:10.744 --> 45:12.411
We have to do something
the police... We have to...

45:12.413 --> 45:14.814
We have to call. We have to
call them right now.

45:14.816 --> 45:17.551
No. The men will catch word
and move them again

45:17.553 --> 45:18.852
we will lose the trail.

45:18.854 --> 45:22.157
No. No. No, no, no!

45:22.159 --> 45:25.226
No, you don't understand!
She's just a girl!

45:25.228 --> 45:27.862
- She's just a girl!
- Miss Drew, please.

45:33.704 --> 45:36.238
This is out
of your control, hmm?

45:36.240 --> 45:37.377
Cállate.

45:39.545 --> 45:42.312
She only has to hang on
for four more hours.

45:42.314 --> 45:45.150
That's all. Okay?

46:00.667 --> 46:02.204
Laura, where are we?

46:03.539 --> 46:05.838
I don't know.

46:05.840 --> 46:08.277
It's Guatemala City,
I think.

46:29.334 --> 46:31.200
Ally, listen to me.

46:31.202 --> 46:35.873
The second this bus stops
and we get any chance, we run.

46:35.875 --> 46:37.677
We run together, okay?

49:19.558 --> 49:21.528
Shh.

49:28.001 --> 49:31.105
No!

49:38.146 --> 49:43.149
No, no! No! No!

49:43.151 --> 49:44.785
No!

49:48.792 --> 49:50.658
No!

53:58.839 --> 54:01.807
- Will she be back?
- Not this time.

54:22.331 --> 54:25.767
Food. Comida, come. Coffee?

54:25.769 --> 54:29.104
Okay. It was not easy.

54:29.106 --> 54:32.842
I just find out where
the brothel is located.

54:32.844 --> 54:35.112
- Where?
- Thirty minutes from here.

54:35.114 --> 54:36.813
- Well, let's go!
- Yes, let's go.

54:36.815 --> 54:38.748
- Where's Raul?
- Raul? Uh...

54:38.750 --> 54:40.417
He's going to catch
another ride home.

54:40.419 --> 54:42.854
He's still mad
about the pantalone.

54:42.856 --> 54:43.857
He's very peculiar.

54:50.765 --> 54:52.167
Okay.

55:42.856 --> 55:44.793
- How much longer?
- Five minutes.

55:53.202 --> 55:54.533
Okay.

55:54.535 --> 55:57.106
Ready? Here we go.

56:30.576 --> 56:33.481
Holly, please.
Allow me, por favor.

56:35.048 --> 56:36.050
I'll take Guadalupe.

56:41.456 --> 56:44.526
What do you know?

57:29.109 --> 57:30.944
Holly, please lock the door.

57:35.316 --> 57:37.449
Fern, I'd like to try talking
to her, if that's okay.

57:37.451 --> 57:40.989
Of course, yeah. Please?

58:11.322 --> 58:12.658
What the hell?

58:15.360 --> 58:16.930
You know what I was saying.

58:18.465 --> 58:20.497
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

58:20.499 --> 58:24.204
Go check the back.
Please. Please.

58:28.141 --> 58:29.241
Huh?

58:29.243 --> 58:30.411
Hmm?

58:51.367 --> 58:53.367
Is everything all right?

58:56.206 --> 58:57.473
No, everything is fine, dear.

59:38.855 --> 59:40.090
Oh!

59:43.592 --> 59:46.260
Fern! Fern,
this is Ally's.

59:49.834 --> 59:51.302
Ahh.

01:00:12.558 --> 01:00:14.792
This one is very disdainful.

01:03:18.701 --> 01:03:20.572
How much farther
to Tenosique?

01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:40.758
What is it?

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.760
The authorities
pulled over the orange bus.

01:03:43.762 --> 01:03:45.931
Only the driver was aboard.

01:03:45.933 --> 01:03:48.736
He resisted
and he was killed.

01:03:51.504 --> 01:03:53.875
We still know where
they're going, right?

01:03:55.008 --> 01:03:56.010
Right?

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.480
El Hotel de California.

01:04:00.482 --> 01:04:01.948
Hotel California?

01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:05.018
It's where all the deals
are made in Tenosique.

01:04:05.020 --> 01:04:07.587
If we do not catch up
to her there,

01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:10.557
she will vanish.

01:04:10.559 --> 01:04:11.962
Forever.

01:04:50.539 --> 01:04:52.805
Es el Hotel California.

01:04:52.807 --> 01:04:54.642
It looks empty.

01:04:56.745 --> 01:04:58.746
That is
El Tren de la Muerte.

01:04:58.748 --> 01:05:00.781
The Train of Death?

01:05:00.783 --> 01:05:03.516
Si, de la Muerte, eh?

01:05:03.518 --> 01:05:06.188
They will hide her on it.

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:08.023
Well, where does it go?

01:05:08.025 --> 01:05:11.526
To the north.
All the way to the U.S.

01:05:11.528 --> 01:05:13.995
What's with the name?

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:16.866
The migrants,
they stow away on it.

01:05:16.868 --> 01:05:18.567
The bandits and the gangsters

01:05:18.569 --> 01:05:21.972
rape or kill them
along the way.

01:05:21.974 --> 01:05:24.474
Some of them, eh,

01:05:24.476 --> 01:05:27.043
- they just fall off.
- So, what's our plan?

01:05:34.854 --> 01:05:36.055
Is that them?

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:53.740
They're coming out.

01:06:53.742 --> 01:06:55.846
- Fern, Fern.
- Ahh.

01:07:03.321 --> 01:07:06.355
- Who are the soldiers?
- Mexican State Police.

01:07:06.357 --> 01:07:09.858
- Why aren't they doing anything?
- Come.

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:11.995
How am I supposed to know?

01:07:11.997 --> 01:07:17.001
That train is surrounded
by corrupt police,

01:07:17.003 --> 01:07:21.739
traffickers, gangsters,
and bandits,

01:07:21.741 --> 01:07:25.710
and those that I don't
generally like all that much.

01:07:25.712 --> 01:07:27.112
Oops. It was loaded.

01:07:27.114 --> 01:07:29.051
Ha!

01:07:31.353 --> 01:07:35.088
I am not going to go
anywhere near that train.

01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:37.790
This is where
the road ends for me.

01:07:37.792 --> 01:07:40.960
- What do you mean?
- I bring you all the way here.

01:07:40.962 --> 01:07:42.730
It should be enough.

01:07:42.732 --> 01:07:45.099
But Ally's down there.
I don't understand.

01:07:45.101 --> 01:07:50.007
My reasons for helping
have expired.

01:07:58.383 --> 01:08:00.217
Get on the train.

01:08:00.219 --> 01:08:02.284
- The train?
- You keep your head down,

01:08:02.286 --> 01:08:04.186
and you should blend in.
But do not talk.

01:08:04.188 --> 01:08:05.922
Your accent will
give you away.

01:08:05.924 --> 01:08:07.824
Blend in with the migrants.

01:08:07.826 --> 01:08:09.359
And when you find
your daughter?

01:08:09.361 --> 01:08:11.395
- You jump off.
- Jump off?

01:08:11.397 --> 01:08:13.231
The train is slow.

01:08:13.233 --> 01:08:15.133
You jump far from it,
you should be fine.

01:08:15.135 --> 01:08:17.201
- And what, then?
- Find the police.

01:08:17.203 --> 01:08:20.738
- Police?
- The other police. The good ones.

01:08:20.741 --> 01:08:22.774
Fern, this is suicide.
Please, come with me.

01:08:22.777 --> 01:08:25.411
How far...

01:08:25.412 --> 01:08:28.050
are you willing to go
to get her back?

01:08:29.417 --> 01:08:31.116
What's this?

01:08:31.118 --> 01:08:33.923
Every woman take that
before getting on the train.

01:08:35.124 --> 01:08:37.425
It's the, uh,
how do you call...

01:08:37.426 --> 01:08:39.359
the morning after pill.

01:08:39.361 --> 01:08:41.462
If you get caught,

01:08:41.464 --> 01:08:44.401
your body becomes
a bargaining chip.

01:08:47.103 --> 01:08:48.372
Fern, please...

01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:52.741
It's 500. This is all
I have on me.

01:08:52.743 --> 01:08:54.776
I hope it's enough
to buy her back.

01:08:54.778 --> 01:08:56.279
But know this,

01:08:56.282 --> 01:08:59.282
if they make a deal with you,
they will honor it.

01:08:59.283 --> 01:09:01.785
These people live
off the ransom money.

01:09:01.787 --> 01:09:05.790
If the word gets out they are not
living up to their agreements,

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:08.162
no one pays the ransom.

01:09:09.296 --> 01:09:11.830
Now go.

01:09:11.832 --> 01:09:13.300
Godspeed, Miss Drew.

01:09:15.135 --> 01:09:18.804
This whole time you weren't
helping Milagra or me.

01:09:18.805 --> 01:09:21.908
You were helping
the angry orphan.

01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:24.511
Milagra said to tell you it's not
your fault Laura got killed.

01:09:24.513 --> 01:09:29.319
She said you were like
a son to her, Fernando Duarte.

01:10:31.154 --> 01:10:32.523
Gracias.

01:17:46.711 --> 01:17:48.580
Gracias.

01:21:33.599 --> 01:21:35.034
Where is Roberto Antigua?

01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:37.638
Who?

01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.517
2,000 cash.

01:21:49.951 --> 01:21:54.620
You and the girl... go.

01:21:54.622 --> 01:21:58.024
I don't have that much.

01:21:58.026 --> 01:21:59.229
I have...

01:22:00.997 --> 01:22:02.933
I have 500.

01:22:10.807 --> 01:22:13.845
500 and you stay with us...

01:22:15.914 --> 01:22:17.046
Daughter...

01:22:17.048 --> 01:22:18.751
free.

01:22:20.084 --> 01:22:22.020
What about me?

01:22:26.091 --> 01:22:28.827
How do I know
you'll let her go?

01:22:36.670 --> 01:22:38.773
Do we have a deal?

01:22:45.413 --> 01:22:48.685
Let her go first.

01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:01.999
Don't touch her.

01:23:03.768 --> 01:23:05.170
Don't you touch her.

01:23:09.072 --> 01:23:10.874
Don't you touch her!

01:26:05.905 --> 01:26:08.509
A... Ally! Ally!

01:26:58.397 --> 01:27:01.235
- How many more?
- Two, I think.

01:27:03.102 --> 01:27:05.237
You think?

01:27:05.239 --> 01:27:06.570
Or you know?

01:27:26.528 --> 01:27:27.530
Roberto Antigua.

01:27:31.068 --> 01:27:32.733
No.

01:27:32.735 --> 01:27:34.372
I am not him.

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:05.340
Ally! Oh!

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:07.575
Mom!

01:29:29.233 --> 01:29:31.501
Thank you, Fernando.

01:29:31.503 --> 01:29:34.270
And you, too...

01:29:34.272 --> 01:29:37.277
Holly Drew. Hmm.

01:29:57.865 --> 01:29:59.101
Yeah.

01:30:01.570 --> 01:30:03.706
- You behave.
- Yes, sir.
