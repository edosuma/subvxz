WEBVTT

00:32.991 --> 00:34.951
Gum's still here, Joseph.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.079
-That's 37 days and counting.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.040
Hey, what's Amy doing?

00:40.123 --> 00:42.208
-Maybe she's giving everyone
pictures of herself

00:42.292 --> 00:44.836
so we can take them home
and stare at them.

00:45.670 --> 00:48.840
I heard some dude tell this
other dude in the bathroom

00:48.923 --> 00:50.383
that she's having a party.

00:50.467 --> 00:52.469
Joseph, we have to go to this party.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.970
Do you think she'll invite us?

00:54.054 --> 00:55.180
We're so in.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.974
Remember how you made her laugh
when you did your monkey voice?

00:58.058 --> 01:01.061
Yeah, but then you asked
if her mom was as hot as she is,

01:01.144 --> 01:03.104
and it really freaked her out.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.647


01:12.072 --> 01:14.574


01:15.200 --> 01:16.326
What are you doing?

01:16.409 --> 01:17.869
I'm gonna touch her neck.

01:17.952 --> 01:19.079
Put your hand down!

01:32.217 --> 01:33.802
You weren't invited.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.264
I hate Amy.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.850
No, I love her.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.687
Look, there she is
with all her "cool" friends.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.858
Wait, how did the new kid
make the inner circle?

02:04.207 --> 02:06.626
-<i>Kathy Griffin is going all in.</i>

02:06.709 --> 02:08.586

Why do movie stars think

02:08.670 --> 02:10.463
we wanna watch them play poker?

02:10.547 --> 02:11.673
Mom, Dad,

02:11.756 --> 02:14.342
I need some money
to get a new pair of jeans.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.302
What happened to your old pair?

02:16.386 --> 02:18.263

Did you make cut-offs again?

02:18.346 --> 02:20.390
No, but I need something cooler.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.475
I think a hundred dollars
ought to cover it.

02:23.059 --> 02:23.893
Ugh!

02:23.977 --> 02:26.271
There's no way I'm buying you those jeans.

02:26.354 --> 02:27.355
They're asinine.

02:27.438 --> 02:28.982
Bobby, sometimes you're cooler

02:29.065 --> 02:31.442
if you don't wear
what everyone else is wearing.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.527
So that's it?

02:32.610 --> 02:34.654
I don't get a say in what I get to wear?

02:34.737 --> 02:36.322
Not when I'm paying for it.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.908
I'd pay for it,
but I don't have any money.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.034
Well, that's too bad.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.161
Because if you did,

02:41.244 --> 02:42.954
I couldn't tell you what to spend it on.

02:43.037 --> 02:43.997
Really?

02:44.080 --> 02:44.956
Well, sure.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.333
Someone who makes his own money
is his own man.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.878
No one can tell him what to do
or what to buy.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.590
I'm gonna get a job.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.718
Yep.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.178
Yep.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.262
Yup.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.680
Mm-hmm.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.600
So Bobby wants me
to spend a hundred dollars

03:03.683 --> 03:07.020
on some idiotic jeans
that already look 20 years old.

03:07.103 --> 03:10.773
Are kids today so lazy
they can't break in a pair of pants?

03:10.857 --> 03:13.818
Rhetorical question.
Not grounds for conversation.

03:13.902 --> 03:14.861
Moving on.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.363
Don't be such a cheapskate, Hank Hill.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.073
You and Peggy made him look like you.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.117
The least you could do
is buy him nice pants.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.619
Shut up, Kahn.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.412
I told Bobby if he wanted them,

03:24.495 --> 03:26.164
he'd have to buy them with his own money.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.540
He said he's gonna get a job,

03:27.624 --> 03:28.875
but I'm not holding my breath.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.043
If I had a son,

03:30.126 --> 03:31.920
I'd buy him whatever he wanted.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.714
Of course, he'd probably end up
walking all over me.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.841
But we'd have fun for a while.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.387
Sorry, I'm late.

03:41.471 --> 03:45.266
Grillstravaganza's coming up
and, well, I got to daydreaming.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.726
That's okay, Dad.

03:46.809 --> 03:49.896
We saved you a seat right here.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.356
What the heck is that?

03:51.439 --> 03:52.607
I got a job.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.109
Joseph and I are advertising
the new apartments

03:55.193 --> 03:56.486
on Frontier Street.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.987
Isn't it exciting, Hank?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.822
And look, he's a natural.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.824
Bobby, where's the kitchen?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.409
Over there.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.994
Well, that's great, Bobby.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.247
You wanted a job,
and you went out and got one.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.831
That's gumption, I tell you what.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.751
Well, this gumption's gonna
buy me some jeans.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.921
Hey, Dad, can you pass me the butter?

04:15.004 --> 04:16.631
Let's eat, then after dinner,

04:16.714 --> 04:18.132
you can point at things.

04:20.426 --> 04:23.554
Whoever decided where
to put the rips is a genius.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.806
Okay, Joseph,

04:24.889 --> 04:27.809
time to make some money
so we can buy those jeans.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.775
Hey, that guy's reading your arrow.

04:35.858 --> 04:38.027
Make him turn! Close the deal!

04:41.322 --> 04:42.532
Did he turn?

04:43.866 --> 04:44.951
-Excuse me.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.953
Where do I go to find a deluxe apartment?

04:47.036 --> 04:48.913
Why this way, sir.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.542
He's only 13, moron.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.377
Why would he wanna rent an apartment?

04:54.460 --> 04:55.545
I just thought--

04:55.628 --> 04:56.504
Nice outfit.

04:56.587 --> 04:57.714
You look like a lipstick.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.300
Why don't you use that arrow
to find your butt?

05:05.513 --> 05:09.809
This job has made us so dorky,
I want to kick my own ass.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.025
Oh, no, cool guys.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.652
And you look like that
and I look like this.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.863
Just put your head down and keep walking.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.824
Yeah, righteous.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.661
Hey, what's up, dudes?

05:29.996 --> 05:31.581
Us? Dudes?

05:31.664 --> 05:33.583
Yeah, you dudes. What's going on?

05:33.666 --> 05:36.336
Uh, not much. Just hanging.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.420
Yeah, hanging.

05:37.503 --> 05:39.672
Feel that. You got some change?

05:39.756 --> 05:40.840
-Sure.
-Sure.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.301
Thanks, man.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.677
You're all right.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.099
If it's a party, we'll be there.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.434
Hey, can I have a dollar?

05:51.517 --> 05:52.643
Get a job.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.354
I tried, but yours doesn't pay enough.

05:54.437 --> 05:55.605
So is Tanya coming?

05:55.688 --> 05:56.773
She's smokin'.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.775
Change? You got any change?

05:58.858 --> 06:01.110
Dude, tell him not to let Tommy deejay.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.488
He's going through
a weird country music phase.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.572
Change?

06:05.615 --> 06:06.824
Thanks, bra.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.954
There you go.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.584
So, wait... you guys
just ask people for money,

06:16.667 --> 06:17.794
and they give it to you?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.629
Some do, some don't.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.799
It separates the righteous from those
who are just taking up space.

06:22.882 --> 06:23.758
Great shoes.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.510
Can I have some of your money? Thanks.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.012
Bumming is so cool.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.389
This is my spot!

06:29.472 --> 06:30.973
Spongy's spot!

06:31.057 --> 06:32.100
Yeah, right.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.434
I don't see your name on it.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.479
Hey, Drew, do you see "Weird Old Dude"
written on the sidewalk?

06:36.562 --> 06:37.563
Nah, man.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.649
Why would we give up this primo location?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.859
No, Spongy's spot.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.654
Been here since Ronald Reagan
kicked me out of my mental hospital.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.072
When was that?

06:46.155 --> 06:48.074
Back in like 19-something?

06:49.826 --> 06:50.993
Oh, come on.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.664
He's not very cool, is he?

06:54.747 --> 06:56.332
Not at all, man.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.167
Nice. I'm only two bucks away

06:58.251 --> 07:00.503
from those kick-ass aviator shades.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.421
Here.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.713
Thanks, bro-bah.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.090
I'll catch you later.

07:04.173 --> 07:05.800
-Catch you later!
-Catch you later!

07:06.426 --> 07:09.929
Aw, man, I guess we got
to go back to work.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.432
Joseph, I'm giving us a promotion.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.934
We're begging!

07:25.778 --> 07:27.989
Could you maybe spare some...

07:28.072 --> 07:29.407
change?

07:31.492 --> 07:32.702
If you give me a dollar

07:32.785 --> 07:35.872
you can punch me anywhere but my head.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.666
Joseph, don't be like that Spongy guy.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.711
Nobody wants to give money
to someone who's desperate.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.046
They want to give it
to someone who's cool.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.047
Look at Derek,

07:45.131 --> 07:47.133
he acts like he doesn't
even want the money.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.886
Like he's doing them a favor
by taking it.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.304
Hi, Derek.

07:51.387 --> 07:52.763
We brought you a veggie wrap.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.515
Hugs!

07:54.599 --> 07:57.560
Aw, man, he's really got it going on.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.353
Wait, did I just sound like a chick?

07:59.437 --> 08:01.939
Okay, I think I got the hang of this.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.693
Hey, dude. Change?

08:05.776 --> 08:06.736
Change?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.362
Got some change for me?

08:11.824 --> 08:12.909
I did it!

08:14.827 --> 08:17.163
You know, if you take
the paper off this sander,

08:17.246 --> 08:19.499
it makes a nice massager.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.126
My neck feels like Jell-O.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.259
So, I saw Bobby leaving for work
pretty early this morning.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.928
Not that I was watching your house.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.680
Yeah, I guess he's really
enjoying his job.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.641
You know, I don't want
to count my chickens,

08:36.724 --> 08:38.809
but everything I've been trying
to teach Bobby

08:38.893 --> 08:40.561
may be finally sinking in.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.689
Why does it always take a hardware store

08:43.773 --> 08:45.399
to get you to open up, Hank?

08:49.904 --> 08:50.738
Wash your windows?

08:50.821 --> 08:51.948
Spongy?

08:52.031 --> 08:53.199
What are you doing over here?

08:53.282 --> 08:54.659
This isn't your neck of the woods.

08:54.742 --> 08:55.868
No money for Spongy.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.870
Too many people. Took my spot.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.372
Well, dang, that ain't right.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.706
You've been there for years.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.417
Since Ronald Reagan kicked me
out of my mental hospital.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.546
Well, it was complicated, Spongy.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.589
Dutch was trying to win a Cold War and--

09:08.673 --> 09:10.967
Mine. Mine, mine, miney, mine!

09:11.050 --> 09:12.677
Uh, here's another dollar.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.803
Good luck.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.347
And, uh, you don't have
to wash my windows.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.515
Wash your windows?

09:17.598 --> 09:18.683
Okay.

09:22.687 --> 09:23.521
There you go.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.524
Look at this!

09:26.607 --> 09:28.651
That guy just gave me two dimes

09:28.734 --> 09:30.152
and a third dime.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.572
We've made more today
than we would've in a week

09:32.655 --> 09:34.740
at that stupid arrow job.

09:34.824 --> 09:38.327
We almost have enough
for that sweet, sweet denim.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.328
Heads up.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.580
Suit alert.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.083
'Sup, fellas.

09:44.166 --> 09:45.918
Spare some change?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.921
Did that guy just give you a dollar?

09:50.298 --> 09:51.799
Uh, yeah.

09:51.882 --> 09:53.467
You, like, hang out on the street

09:53.551 --> 09:54.677
and ask people for money?

09:54.760 --> 09:55.970
Yeah.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.179
You got any?

09:57.263 --> 09:59.432
Uh... uh, I think so.

10:00.808 --> 10:03.102
The little mama in the poncho
just gave me a fiver.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.271
Who wants some mocha? Bobby? Joseph?

10:05.354 --> 10:06.689
-Sure.
-Sure.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.402
I don't know if you guys have heard,

10:11.485 --> 10:12.862
but I'm having a party and, uh--

10:12.945 --> 10:14.864
We might be able to do a pop-in.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.782
Let's just keep it loose.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.881
-'Sup, 'sup, 'sup.
-'Sup.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.341
Oh, man,

10:33.424 --> 10:35.384
those are the guys
who live on the streets.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.678
I heard they got a dollar
off Principal Moss.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.972
I heard Principal Moss
tried to suspend them,

10:40.056 --> 10:41.641
but he couldn't look them in the eye.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.811
That was cool!

10:45.895 --> 10:47.271
Let's do it again.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.110
Huh.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.737
I do like sourdough.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.197
I told you you did.

10:56.280 --> 10:59.325
Bobby, don't think I haven't
noticed your new jeans.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.951
You look very handsome.

11:01.035 --> 11:01.869
Thanks.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.829
You know, I feel handsome.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.957
Well, I hate those pants
more than life itself,

11:07.041 --> 11:09.669
but I can't tell you about that
because I didn't buy them.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.545
You know, Dad, you were right.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.714
This working thing is great.

11:13.798 --> 11:17.301
I thought I was happy
back when I was just spending your money,

11:17.385 --> 11:20.096
but spending my own money is even better.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.183
I'll be taking that. Thank you.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.685
No, Bobby.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.270
You shouldn't spend
your hard-earned money on us.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.482
But I made it,
and I can spend it on whatever I want.

11:31.565 --> 11:32.400
Right, Dad?

11:34.735 --> 11:36.570
Your father is very proud.

11:38.823 --> 11:39.990
What up, Judy?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.909
Hey, Tom, looking good.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.369
Hi, Mrs. Green.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.704
Rockin' hairnet.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.498
How about you score me
an extra scoop of potatoes?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.918
Thanks, Mrs. G.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.087
Hi, Bobby. Nice shirt.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.880
That's my favorite fake baseball team.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.048
Thanks.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.260
So, I don't know if you like movies

11:59.343 --> 12:01.929
or going to the mall, but if you do,

12:02.012 --> 12:04.181
I was thinking we could go out sometime.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.766
Yeah, that sounds cool.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.727
Great. See ya later.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.527
Man, life is so sweet.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.778
Spare some change?

12:17.862 --> 12:20.114
I love my job, I got great clothes.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.699
Hey, buddy, got a dollar?

12:21.824 --> 12:25.745
And my interest level among the ladies
is on the riz-ize.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.831
Thanks a lot, man.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.166
Have a nice greed.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.043
But what I like best is being my own man.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.503
Why do you do it, Derek?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.589
I don't know, it's just cool.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.007
I mean, take that guy.

12:38.090 --> 12:40.634
He has money, I'm over here wanting it.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.344
It's just economics, dude.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.471
Yeah.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.140
Awesome.

12:46.223 --> 12:48.142
If I do this every day 'til I die,

12:48.225 --> 12:49.935
I'm gonna be so rich!

12:50.019 --> 12:53.063
Yeah, then we can buy a jet
and fly to other countries

12:53.147 --> 12:55.775
and ask them for their money...
like Euros.

12:55.858 --> 12:56.984
And China money.

13:00.529 --> 13:03.949
-Uh, good work, Spongy.
-Aah!

13:04.617 --> 13:06.535
Hank, we can't drive like this.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.079
Now go in and get something
to clean the window.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.957
I can't clean it
if he's standing right there.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.667
It would hurt his feelings.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.461
Well, we can't just sit here.

13:15.544 --> 13:18.964
There's a store on Main Street
where we can get some Windex.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.801
Stick your head out the window
and tell me where we're going.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.138
I can see why Lady Bird likes this.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.894
Hey, bra, spare some change?

13:31.977 --> 13:33.145
Bobby?

13:37.858 --> 13:39.985
What in the heck
do you think you're doing?

13:40.069 --> 13:40.903
I'm working.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.279
This is my job.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.364
You're a bum.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.991
Is this how you paid for our dinner?
How could you?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.993
How could you disrespect steak?

13:48.077 --> 13:50.454
I'm not one of those "bum" bums.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.831
I'm a cool bum.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.666
You're not gonna be any kind of bum.

13:53.749 --> 13:54.708
Now get in the car.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.418
Why are you so upset?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.254
You told me to earn my own money,

13:58.337 --> 13:59.964
and I am... tons of it.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.632
You're not earning anything.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.218
You're sitting on your butt
while people hand it to you.

14:04.301 --> 14:07.012
Dude, either give him some change
or move on.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.390
Are you the reason my son
is out here begging?

14:09.473 --> 14:12.017
Yeah, and you're welcome, guy.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.106
Car. Now.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.692
So this bum guy,

14:19.775 --> 14:21.777
-he wasn't in a wheelchair?
-Nope.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.154
And he wasn't yelling about Jesus?

14:24.238 --> 14:25.114
No.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.074
He was a normal, able-bodied kid.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.367
I don't understand.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.160
Are you sure he was a bum?

14:30.244 --> 14:32.913
Yes, and he's got Bobby being a bum, too.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.248
"Homeless," Hank.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.625
They prefer to be called "homeless."

14:36.709 --> 14:38.377
Bobby is not homeless.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.170
He has a home... My home.

14:40.254 --> 14:43.132
Well, I don't mind
that Joseph is "homeless."

14:43.215 --> 14:44.216
He begs for money.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.467
I get to spend it.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.844
It's win-win, really.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.262
No! It's wrong.

14:48.345 --> 14:51.098
Guys like Spongy beg because they have to,

14:51.181 --> 14:53.183
but these punks are doing it for fun.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.437
How much spare change
do you think there is in Arlen anyway?

14:57.021 --> 14:58.188
I agree with Hank.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.732
If you're gonna beg for money,

14:59.815 --> 15:02.693
you have to be crazy, drunk, or disabled.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.404
Or one of those guys
who paints himself silver

15:05.487 --> 15:06.739
and moves like a robot.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.493
All right, Bobby.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.746
We're not leaving until you unbum

15:13.829 --> 15:15.748
every cent you took from these people.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.291
I don't understand.

15:17.374 --> 15:20.169
If people wanna give me money,
what's the big deal?

15:20.252 --> 15:23.130
The big deal is
if you're relying on handouts,

15:23.213 --> 15:24.298
you're not in control

15:24.381 --> 15:25.215
of your life.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.426
You're letting other people
decide how you live.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.429
Does this boy look familiar to you?

15:30.512 --> 15:32.556
You may have given him some change.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.853
Did you give me some change?

15:37.937 --> 15:39.229
Here's your change.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.065
Take back your change.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.068
Hank Hill.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.654
Well, that customer is full of bunk.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.990
Sales tax is absolutely constitutional.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.325
All right, put him on.

15:51.408 --> 15:52.785
Bobby, I've gotta take this.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.703
You just keep giving that money back.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.913
Fine.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.290
I think you gave me some money.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.209
Did you give me a dollar?

16:00.292 --> 16:01.168
Hey, Bobby.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.045
We're gonna go buy
Lance Armstrong bracelets.

16:03.128 --> 16:03.963
You wanna come?

16:04.046 --> 16:05.172
I can't.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.840
My dad is making me give back

16:06.924 --> 16:08.717
all the money I bummed off people.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.552
Oh, you should totally give it to us.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.304
Then we're doing each other a solid.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.264
We get the money
and you don't have to stand here

16:14.348 --> 16:15.182
looking like a tool.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.521
No, I'm supposed to give it back
to the people who gave it to me.

16:20.604 --> 16:22.189
Come on, Bob.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.358
Us street guys gotta stick together.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.693
You're cool, right?

16:27.027 --> 16:28.028
Yeah.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.868
Man, if anybody finds out we're not bums,

16:34.952 --> 16:37.121
we're so not gonna be cool anymore.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.248
Yeah, we got to protect our rep.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.208
Hey, bra, spare a pencil?

16:41.291 --> 16:42.793
Sure. Here's two.

16:43.794 --> 16:44.878
Hey, Bobby.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.548
So, have you seen
the new Will Ferrell movie yet?

16:47.631 --> 16:49.925
No. It looks pretty funny though.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.885
He's got those shoes that can talk.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.972
Yeah, I really wanna see it.

16:55.055 --> 16:57.307
Yeah, me too.

16:58.183 --> 16:59.351
So...

16:59.893 --> 17:01.145
So.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.231
Oh.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.025
You wanna go see it this weekend?

17:06.108 --> 17:07.651
Sounds great.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.488
Dang it. What am I gonna do?

17:11.572 --> 17:13.532
How am I supposed
to take Sandy to the movies

17:13.615 --> 17:14.992
when I don't have any money?

17:15.075 --> 17:16.368
I wish I could help you out,

17:16.452 --> 17:19.580
but my dad found my money
and bought stuff.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.165
Does Sandy like cigarettes?

17:24.752 --> 17:26.962
Hey, dude, how about some change?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.756
How about you go drop dead?

17:28.839 --> 17:30.090
Will do, bud.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.425
Hey, Bob, what's up?

17:31.508 --> 17:33.343
Hey, guys, I need your help.

17:33.427 --> 17:36.180
I asked this really cute girl
to the movies and she said yes,

17:36.263 --> 17:37.931
but I don't have any money.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.434
So can I have some of that change
I gave you the other day?

17:40.517 --> 17:41.852
Sorry, dude, we spent it.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.438
Yeah, we got Barks that cool dog hoodie.

17:45.439 --> 17:46.523
Oh, sorry.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.941
Good luck with your chick.

17:48.025 --> 17:48.942
That's it?

17:49.026 --> 17:50.736
You don't have anything for me?

17:50.819 --> 17:52.446
What about all that money?

17:52.529 --> 17:54.531
I thought we were all sticking together.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.532
Please.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.700
Come on, I'm desperate.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.160
Dude, he's freaking out.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.454
Seriously, you're screwing up our action.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.539
Let's hit the Coinstar and grab some Thai.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.916
Come on, guys.

18:03.999 --> 18:05.626
What about the time we chilled together?

18:05.709 --> 18:07.044
You called me dude.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.879
I need money!

18:12.382 --> 18:13.592
Have you seen Bobby?

18:13.675 --> 18:15.552
Lady Bird's not gonna wash herself.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.388
Finally, something
your precious dog can't do.

18:19.807 --> 18:20.641
Hey, Kahn!

18:20.724 --> 18:22.976
Is Bobby doing homework with Connie?

18:23.060 --> 18:25.229
What you think, he over here
begging for answers?

18:27.314 --> 18:30.317
Ah, but seriously, Hank, I see him
on street corner downtown.

18:30.400 --> 18:31.401
Dang it.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.821
Uh, you may not have perspective on this,

18:33.904 --> 18:37.074
being hillbilly redneck,
but it bring shame on your family.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.837
That sign better not say
you're some kind of veteran.

18:50.420 --> 18:51.338
Can't talk, Dad.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.548
I'm on the clock.

18:52.631 --> 18:53.757
You're working?

18:53.841 --> 18:54.758
Well, yeah.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.468
I mean, like you said,

18:56.552 --> 18:59.388
I can't just count on people
giving me money when I need it,

18:59.471 --> 19:01.849
and I really need it for my date tonight.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.600
I don't know what a vasectomy is,

19:03.684 --> 19:05.394
but if you wanna reverse it,

19:05.477 --> 19:06.603
here's a coupon.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.941
Uh, you know, it's kinda hot out here.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.151
I'm gonna get you a soda.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.443
You just keep working.

19:16.029 --> 19:19.199
-Nice sign, dude.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.701
Hey, I'm trying to work here.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.454
"Work." Go punch your time card, worker.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.208
Hey, dude, spare some change?

19:29.042 --> 19:30.210
-Hey, Derek.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.129
Here's your mocha.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.260
Thanks.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.763
Don't give them money!

19:41.847 --> 19:44.016
Get your vasectomies reversed!

19:44.808 --> 19:47.144
Why shouldn't they have to work
like the rest of us?

19:47.227 --> 19:48.896
I'm busting my tail,

19:48.979 --> 19:51.440
and they're just sitting on theirs
with their hands out.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.816
They're not homeless.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.484
They're not street people.

19:54.568 --> 19:55.986
They're not even bums.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.404
They're just posers.

19:57.487 --> 19:59.156
Lazy posers.

20:01.116 --> 20:05.704
I know for a fact he has basic
and premium cable.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.998
And he takes tennis lessons.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.170
Cut the crap, dude.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.257
I wouldn't do that.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.760
If I were you,
I would get out of here right now.

20:19.843 --> 20:21.178
Or, or what?

20:21.261 --> 20:22.262
You'll tell my mom?

20:23.430 --> 20:26.099
No, I'll kick your ass up
one side of the street

20:26.183 --> 20:27.184
and down the other.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.607
This place is weak.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.778
So, uh, don't you have a date
you need to get to?

20:37.861 --> 20:39.821
I think I'm gonna put in
a couple more hours

20:39.905 --> 20:40.864
for snack money.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.033
A small popcorn and no drink

20:43.116 --> 20:45.535
is no way to start a relationship.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.295
Hey, there, Spongy.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.381
Good to see you got your old spot back.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.590
Congratulations.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.968
You're back on top. Kinda.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.137
You paid for a song.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.940
<i>So how long do we have
to stand here?</i>

21:48.849 --> 21:50.434
-<i>'Sup, 'sup, 'sup.</i>
<i>'Sup.</i>
