1
00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:09.166
Hang 'em high!

2
00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.041
Snap their spindly necks!

3
00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.458
Yeah! Drop them!

4
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.666
To the brave boys of Temeria!

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.083
Kick those Kaedwenian arses
back to their icy shithole of a state!

6
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.750
Traveled far, friend?

7
00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:33.041
I go where King Demavend sends me.

8
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:34.250
Royal messenger?

9
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.416
I suppose
you'll be taking my best horse, then?

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.250
Well, I'll leave him at the next post.
Under the name of Aplegatt.

11
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.000
Lame and over-ridden, no doubt.

12
00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:49.833
Well, give us a draught of your finest ale
and... I'll add it to the king's bill.

13
00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:50.916
Huh.

14
00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.541
Seems festive in these parts.

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.141
Hanging's good for business.

16
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.291
That spy was our fourth execution
in as many days.

17
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:04.208
- One Kaedwenian, one Aerdirnian...
- Look at those eyes.

18
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:05.916
Look at her!

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.875
See, that's the problem.
What's a mage doing all the way out here?

20
00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.833
She should be focusing
on keeping the Royal peace,

21
00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:15.500
not swannin' idly around the countryside.

22
00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:19.791
Looking like that, though,
she can idle around me tonight.

23
00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:24.291
You do know that they keep their beauty
by bathin' in human blood every night, eh?

24
00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:26.083
Thanks for the ale.

25
00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:28.375
I'll be seein' you.

26
00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.791
Straight to Tissaia.
No portals.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.625
Yes, my lady.

28
00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:46.083
Cold one, isn't it?

29
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:50.625
God speed, miss.

30
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.208
I was just... wishin' you a safe journey.

31
00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:14.958
- I saw you.
- What?

32
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:19.708
Apologies, good sir. Never mind the girl.
She was kicked in the head by a horse.

33
00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:22.375
- Hasn't been right since.
- No.

34
00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:24.958
There was a tower. An arrow struck you.

35
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:27.833
Remember I said we need to keep
a low profile? That was not that.

36
00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:30.625
- I cannot control my visions.
- You can control who you blab to.

37
00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:32.750
Stop hauling me like I'm a mewling brat.

38
00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:35.791
I saw his death
and I need to go back there.

39
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.083
What if his death
prevented a greater harm?

40
00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.541
What would the consequence be then,
my ugly one?

41
00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.458
I don't know.

42
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:44.750
I don't know either.

43
00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:47.833
But changing destiny
is a weighty business.

44
00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.083
Your visions are becoming more frequent.

45
00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:54.208
It's only a matter of time
before someone finds us.

46
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.625
We need to get to Aretuza
more quickly.

47
00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.083
You're afraid.

48
00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:04.666
I promised Geralt I'd keep you safe.
We need something untraceable.

49
00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.125
We're going shopping.

50
00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:29.416
I'll never get over how cute
they look, you know? For monsters.

51
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.708
I mean, they've got
these little teddy bear faces,

52
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:34.166
- and they're like...
- "No, please, don't hurt me!"

53
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.333
And then, wham, fangs.

54
00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:39.541
Just, like, a boatload of fangs.
All up in your business.

55
00:03:40.416 --> 00:03:42.250
How many people
did you say this thing ate?

56
00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:43.416
- Seven.
- Yikes.

57
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.958
- And we'll need all of that.
- All right, we... Whoa.

58
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:49.500
Really? I mean, how much could
their information possibly cost?

59
00:03:49.583 --> 00:03:51.666
To find who's hunting Ciri? A lot.

60
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.750
Really? And why do we need that?

61
00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.166
Whoa!

62
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.875
Is that a giant metal spike
hidden in your secret door of mystery

63
00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:05.458
or are you just pleased to...

64
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:08.041
- Not your best.
- Yeah, can't all be gold.

65
00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:12.375
Ah.

66
00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:15.166
How did I know that would be you?

67
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.000
- Hello, Codringher.
- Hello, Geralt.

68
00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:21.500
Oh, goodness me,
the Viscount of Lettenhove.

69
00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:23.166
A rare pleasure.

70
00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:28.083
You know, I had that safety device
replaced just now.

71
00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:31.708
Next time, make an appointment, eh?

72
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.500
Come in.

73
00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:44.416
Good morrow, my lord. 'Tis ready for you.

74
00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:50.500
Hmm.

75
00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:57.166
Now, this will help get you
what you deserve.

76
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.791
- You had them fix the balance?
- No shit. You told me to.

77
00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:04.833
My wife rather likes my head.

78
00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:07.291
- So I thought, best to follow orders.
- Huh.

79
00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:12.250
You know,
a sword like this won me an empire once.

80
00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:14.833
Hmm. I'd like to hear about it.

81
00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:20.041
Late summer. 1260.

82
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:25.000
I was down to the last of my men.

83
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.333
We hadn't eaten in days.

84
00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:32.875
Our swords were dull as spoons
from the bloody skirmishes. Aah...

85
00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:39.583
It was my last chance
to take down the Usurper.

86
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:44.166
I realized

87
00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:48.166
the only way
that I could reclaim my throne

88
00:05:49.166 --> 00:05:50.708
was to infiltrate the castle,

89
00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:56.208
kill everyone that stood between me
and the man that's stolen my life.

90
00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:57.833
A brave endeavor.

91
00:05:59.916 --> 00:06:01.541
You mean a foolish one.

92
00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:04.875
Emperor.

93
00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:10.166
I traded my boots to a dwarf
in return for a Mahakam steel sword.

94
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.291
Aaah.

95
00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:16.833
It was that sword
that decapitated the bastard.

96
00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:20.333
One day,

97
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.250
war will be a thing of the past.

98
00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:24.791
It will be a distant memory.

99
00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:28.250
I will have my queen by my side

100
00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.750
and the races of our world,
they will live in peace.

101
00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:33.875
And you will make me a new sword.

102
00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:36.291
One worthy of your craft.

103
00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:41.208
A sword befitting
the Emperor of the Continent.

104
00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:44.166
I'll drink to that.

105
00:06:49.916 --> 00:06:52.250
What is it?

106
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.291
Fuck Kaer Morhen!

107
00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:55.375
Not poison.

108
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.416
Everyone drink.

109
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.500
Drink.

110
00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:13.333
I can't.

111
00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:15.625
You want the White Flame to be poisoned?

112
00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:26.333
Drink.

113
00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:34.333
I said, drink.

114
00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:46.208
It's not poison.

115
00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:50.500
Jaskier! This is a treat.

116
00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:54.541
Oh, I can assure you, madam,
the treat is entirely mine.

117
00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:55.500
Oh!

118
00:07:55.583 --> 00:07:59.333
I'd sign something for you, but it does
look like you have a shortage on paper.

119
00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:02.833
You once said that, like a witcher,

120
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:07.291
you protect people from monsters
and monstrous difficulties.

121
00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.666
Since you already knew of my arrival,

122
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.208
let's talk about my... difficulties.

123
00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:25.041
That Rience, who interests you so much,
is quite a mysterious character.

124
00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:27.458
Mmm, we've heard of him, of course.

125
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.125
The question is,

126
00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:31.250
why have you?

127
00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:36.208
He threatened to kill a friend of mine.

128
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.375
Not me. Don't worry.

129
00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:42.708
Sorcerer's rejects
do often train as killers.

130
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:46.708
And this Rience,
we know, was kicked out of Ban Ard.

131
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:48.833
- That supports our theory.
- What theory?

132
00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:51.291
That he's working
for a sorcerer more powerful than him.

133
00:08:55.791 --> 00:08:56.791
Hmm.

134
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:05.916
You alarmed my cat.

135
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.458
I do apologize.

136
00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:10.750
I assumed the clink of coin
was the last thing that would startle it.

137
00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:15.041
I'm afraid that information
will cost you a bit more, Geralt.

138
00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:20.333
Let's try a wager.

139
00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:24.500
I shall turn my back,

140
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:28.583
and you shall throw this at my head.

141
00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:30.125
Should you hit,

142
00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:31.541
you win.

143
00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:33.458
Should you miss,

144
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:35.791
you will give me the information
that I want,

145
00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:38.541
on credit, of course.

146
00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:43.833
You're not seriously suggesting
that I accept this wager?

147
00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:45.666
No, I'm...

148
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.333
sure you will.

149
00:10:01.958 --> 00:10:03.250
You didn't even flinch.

150
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:06.041
Why would I flinch?

151
00:10:06.666 --> 00:10:08.041
I heard you aiming to miss.

152
00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.458
Old softy.

153
00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:20.041
Some official sorcerers have secret pupils

154
00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:23.416
doing illegal or... dirty business.

155
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.375
In sorcerer slang, it's described
as having someone on a leash.

156
00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:27.708
Whose leash?

157
00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:29.000
We don't know.

158
00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:35.041
But we do know where this sorcerer
is doing his dirty business.

159
00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:38.416
There is a castle called Vuilpanne,
uh, near the old scarlet...

160
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.333
- Ammonite mines.
- Yeah.

161
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:42.833
On the outskirts of Piana.

162
00:10:42.916 --> 00:10:45.916
If you know that,
you're already in too deep.

163
00:10:46.916 --> 00:10:49.958
This mage, whoever it is,

164
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.333
is very dangerous.

165
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.000
Let it lie, Geralt.

166
00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:58.458
I shall not. But you knew that already.

167
00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:00.333
Thank you for your time.

168
00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:06.416
Do give our best
to the Elder Blood princess.

169
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.583
You have a client looking for her?

170
00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:23.125
Istredd.

171
00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:26.750
The mage?

172
00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:30.250
You must know
he isn't the only one willing to pay

173
00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:33.000
for the girl traveling
with the white-haired witcher.

174
00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:37.208
You want to save her?
You need to find another girl...

175
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.875
An orphan of war, perhaps.

176
00:11:39.958 --> 00:11:42.416
- Ashen hair, green eyes...
- No.

177
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.125
Geralt, my friend,

178
00:11:45.958 --> 00:11:49.250
a time of contempt is approaching.

179
00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:53.333
Deep and utter contempt.

180
00:11:54.666 --> 00:11:57.500
My proposition is a simple solution.

181
00:11:58.041 --> 00:11:59.750
Someone has to die

182
00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:01.625
so someone else

183
00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:03.708
can live.

184
00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:12.833
I will not pay for what I love
by having contempt for myself.

185
00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:19.083
Let's go.

186
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.500
Thank you.

187
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.750
Rogue mages, power-hungry monarchs,
and now Istredd.

188
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.708
Aren't you tired
of being on the run all the time?

189
00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:33.625
Maybe we could find
somewhere safe for her?

190
00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:37.750
Why don't we brainstorm solutions
on our way to Redania?

191
00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:40.458
Hey.

192
00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:43.375
I can hear you thinking.

193
00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:46.208
Don't start playing
the "I travel alone" card

194
00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:48.250
or "Jaskier, it's too dangerous" card.

195
00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:51.041
I would like to remind you
that I was just bait

196
00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:52.833
for Mr. Fire-Fingers.

197
00:12:52.916 --> 00:12:54.583
I appreciate it, Jask.

198
00:12:55.416 --> 00:12:57.583
I don't want to put you
in harm's way again.

199
00:12:58.083 --> 00:13:00.250
It's why I have to go to Vuilpanne.

200
00:13:01.958 --> 00:13:04.000
I'll come find you when Rience is dead.

201
00:13:05.916 --> 00:13:07.458
Or he'll find me once you are.

202
00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:29.750
- What are we shopping for, exactly?
- A miracle. Keep up.

203
00:13:34.166 --> 00:13:36.125
What was that letter you sent earlier?

204
00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:39.916
It's for Tissaia.
Telling her I'm coming home.

205
00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:42.958
Is there a chance she might say no?

206
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:46.333
It's complicated.

207
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:49.166
Because of me?

208
00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:52.083
Yes, you do tend to complicate things.

209
00:13:54.916 --> 00:13:57.333
Yes, well, I'm not the only one.

210
00:13:59.125 --> 00:14:00.458
You may be watching me,

211
00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.208
but I have eyes too.

212
00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:06.541
And what do you see, my ugly one?

213
00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:09.875
Most times,
a picture of powerful perfection.

214
00:14:10.791 --> 00:14:12.750
Excellent.

215
00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:16.083
But you wrote three drafts of that letter.

216
00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:19.166
So there's more to the picture,
isn't there?

217
00:14:22.166 --> 00:14:23.791
We need to keep moving.

218
00:14:23.875 --> 00:14:26.750
Here. Run this
through that tangled mop on your head.

219
00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:31.958
- Password.
- Ragamuffin.

220
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:36.916
Training hasn't helped
control your power as I'd hoped.

221
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.458
If anything, it's brought it
to the surface, made it more present.

222
00:14:41.125 --> 00:14:42.125
Great.

223
00:14:42.958 --> 00:14:45.250
At Aretuza,
you can learn to focus your visions

224
00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:47.333
on the future you actually want to see.

225
00:14:47.416 --> 00:14:49.776
- Over here!
- What if I don't want to see anything?

226
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:52.000
Well, then you're blind
to the big picture.

227
00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:53.291
Put it down there!

228
00:14:53.791 --> 00:14:55.583
Here she is. Come along!

229
00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:02.041
Yen! Thank the gods, you're alive.

230
00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:06.208
- Tell me you've got good gossip.
- No time, Keira. I need your help.

231
00:15:06.291 --> 00:15:09.375
My handmaiden and I are in need
of one of your portals.

232
00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:11.166
To Aretuza.

233
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.208
You're going back to Aretuza?

234
00:15:13.291 --> 00:15:16.041
After that legendary night
of non-fatal execution?

235
00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:19.791
Well, I'm hoping they've forgotten
about that. Or forgiven me, anyway.

236
00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:22.708
Mmph! Good luck.
Tissaia still hasn't forgiven me.

237
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:25.625
You fuck one upstart prince
with designs on the throne...

238
00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:27.833
Anyway, it's good to see you.

239
00:15:27.916 --> 00:15:29.958
Business has been achingly slow.

240
00:15:30.041 --> 00:15:32.458
People are decapitated
if they stray their kingdoms.

241
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:33.375
By whom?

242
00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:35.125
Each other.

243
00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:36.408
With Nilfgaard on the horizon,

244
00:15:36.458 --> 00:15:39.041
you'd think the North
would have got their shit together by now.

245
00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:42.458
- Is there nothing the Brotherhood can do?
- Oi, hurry up.

246
00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:45.666
Go on.

247
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.625
I need a portal to Claremont.

248
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.541
This one's got somethin' waitin' for them.

249
00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.291
Now.

250
00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:13.708
Fancy a sniff, love?

251
00:16:14.791 --> 00:16:15.791
I don't partake.

252
00:16:21.416 --> 00:16:23.458
Kill the bitch!

253
00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:27.416
Ciri!

254
00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:36.000
Hold it open. I won't be long.

255
00:16:36.083 --> 00:16:37.083
Run! Run!

256
00:16:37.833 --> 00:16:39.708
Hey! What the fuck?

257
00:16:42.041 --> 00:16:44.375
You have no idea who you've just crossed...

258
00:16:57.416 --> 00:16:58.496
What have you done?

259
00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:02.041
That was one of Houvenaghel's men.

260
00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:04.875
If you don't want to end up decapitated,
I suggest you run too.

261
00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:06.750
Keira, wait...

262
00:17:10.083 --> 00:17:11.083
Go.

263
00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:16.000
Magic is organizing Chaos.

264
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.166
This requires two things.

265
00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:21.208
Balance and control.

266
00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.500
Without them, Chaos will kill you.

267
00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:27.416
Has anyone seen Nissa?

268
00:17:31.375 --> 00:17:33.083
Elizabet, fetch Nissa from her room,

269
00:17:33.166 --> 00:17:36.791
and remind her that sickness of any sort,
including homesickness,

270
00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:38.416
will not be tolerated.

271
00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:43.958
Go back and try again,
Sabrina. We cannot let this stand.

272
00:17:44.666 --> 00:17:47.625
I'm telling you, he's immovable.

273
00:17:47.708 --> 00:17:50.541
He says Foltest and his people can starve
for all he cares.

274
00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:53.500
Even if Henselt wanted
to send the grain to Temeria,

275
00:17:53.583 --> 00:17:56.083
the damn Scoia'tael
would just steal it on the way.

276
00:17:56.166 --> 00:17:58.916
We're wondering why
the kings are losing faith in us.

277
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.791
Because we knew the elves were a problem
and we did nothing about it.

278
00:18:02.875 --> 00:18:05.708
That's... a short-sighted view of history.

279
00:18:06.208 --> 00:18:08.166
But I expect nothing less from you.

280
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:09.666
Enough coddling.

281
00:18:10.416 --> 00:18:13.791
Return Triss to Foltest's court
and let's get this rough patch smoothed.

282
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:17.583
That would be as useful
as putting bandage on a severed limb.

283
00:18:17.666 --> 00:18:21.166
Tissaia promised them
Cirilla of Cintra's head on a platter

284
00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.458
and she failed to deliver.

285
00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:25.666
We want peace,
let's find the brat and kill her.

286
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.666
No!

287
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.041
Last I checked, slinging matches are not
how we conduct business here.

288
00:18:30.583 --> 00:18:34.500
We will take all concerns to the full body
of the Council, as we always have.

289
00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:37.625
In the meantime,
you are disrupting lessons.

290
00:18:49.791 --> 00:18:50.958
They're not wrong.

291
00:18:52.083 --> 00:18:53.416
Loath as I am to admit it...

292
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.500
- If you return to court...
- I told you.

293
00:18:55.583 --> 00:18:58.833
The Brotherhood is welcome
to fill my position at Temeria any time.

294
00:18:58.916 --> 00:19:02.750
I am best placed here with you, helping
these girls learn what they're capable of.

295
00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:04.750
It is a noble calling.

296
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.333
But I can't help but wonder
if it's really about them.

297
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.920
Just because
you couldn't help Ciri...

298
00:19:15.416 --> 00:19:17.000
I will go and check on Nissa.

299
00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:34.375
Nissa?

300
00:20:15.583 --> 00:20:17.333
Tell me about the elf.

301
00:20:17.416 --> 00:20:19.500
Count de Noailles
had captured an elf.

302
00:20:20.083 --> 00:20:22.666
He said she was an assassin.

303
00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:24.791
Louder!

304
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.500
Speak!

305
00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:34.666
He... made me cut her...

306
00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:37.875
in a thousand different ways.

307
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.500
And...

308
00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:43.666
What did you do?

309
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:48.000
I... cut too deep.

310
00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.875
And that was my first kill.

311
00:21:02.166 --> 00:21:03.666
Please, no...

312
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.666
Did that excite you?

313
00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:10.833
No.

314
00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:13.625
It made me angry.

315
00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:16.708
It was a waste.

316
00:21:17.833 --> 00:21:19.458
We could have turned that elf.

317
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.083
Made her do our bidding.

318
00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:27.166
She could have... been useful.

319
00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:32.750
Yes. Useful.

320
00:21:34.041 --> 00:21:35.041
Good boy.

321
00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:50.125
You, uh... you went
quite a bit harder that time.

322
00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:51.666
Not too hard?

323
00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:58.333
You always give me perspective. Clarity.

324
00:21:59.416 --> 00:22:01.375
Thank you.

325
00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:04.875
I need you to do something in return.

326
00:22:06.916 --> 00:22:09.833
Radovid has surprisingly good instincts.

327
00:22:10.666 --> 00:22:12.666
Perhaps he could help
keep Vizimir in line.

328
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.208
I don't need help.
I've been managing him for years.

329
00:22:15.291 --> 00:22:17.916
I've never seen
this Continent more divided.

330
00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:22.875
Nilfgaard's not the only ones
who know it's ripe for the taking.

331
00:22:22.958 --> 00:22:25.208
And if Radovid could be useful to us...

332
00:22:25.291 --> 00:22:26.958
To Redania.

333
00:22:31.875 --> 00:22:33.583
Speak to him. Hmm?

334
00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:38.375
For me.

335
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:42.750
Hmm.

336
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.875
We're done.

337
00:22:56.916 --> 00:22:57.916
Ahem.

338
00:23:01.583 --> 00:23:03.500
It's him. Jaskier.

339
00:23:03.583 --> 00:23:04.958
It's the Dandelion.

340
00:23:05.666 --> 00:23:08.083
- Can't believe it!
- My man said I had a visitor.

341
00:23:08.958 --> 00:23:11.250
But this, I must say, is a nice surprise.

342
00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:13.500
- Mmm.
- Have you come to sing us a pretty song?

343
00:23:13.583 --> 00:23:17.166
Ha, ha! Uh, no. No, I don't, uh...
I don't do pretty.

344
00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:19.375
I have information.

345
00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:25.333
Those two detectives,
Codringher and Fenn, you've heard of them?

346
00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:26.416
No.

347
00:23:27.666 --> 00:23:28.750
Regardless,

348
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.625
they know who Rience is working for.

349
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.541
- Trivia.
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:23:33.625 --> 00:23:34.625
Oh, tell me.

351
00:23:34.666 --> 00:23:38.333
Geralt is determined to solve it
in his Geralt way,

352
00:23:38.416 --> 00:23:42.500
because he didn't have enough money
to pry their lips apart, but...

353
00:23:44.041 --> 00:23:45.875
you do, I assume.

354
00:23:47.625 --> 00:23:49.500
I appreciate the information,

355
00:23:49.583 --> 00:23:52.083
I do, but what I really want is a song.

356
00:23:52.166 --> 00:23:53.000
Uh...

357
00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:56.125
No. No, I'm, uh...
not really in a singing mood.

358
00:23:56.208 --> 00:23:57.583
- Oh, go on.
- No. Uh...

359
00:23:57.666 --> 00:24:00.833
Your clientele look like they're having
a very lovely time without me...

360
00:24:00.916 --> 00:24:03.083
Pick your favorite. Please.

361
00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:06.916
They'd love a song
about your white-haired witcher.

362
00:24:07.833 --> 00:24:08.833
All right.

363
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.291
I'm so excited!

364
00:24:29.541 --> 00:24:32.041
It's probably a trap.

365
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:40.500
Mm-hmm.

366
00:25:57.166 --> 00:25:58.583
Definitely a trap.

367
00:26:05.583 --> 00:26:07.250
May as well talk about it.

368
00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:10.333
I know you're angry.

369
00:26:10.916 --> 00:26:13.791
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

370
00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:19.916
I did say we needed
to avoid unwanted attention.

371
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I know.

372
00:26:22.125 --> 00:26:23.245
This one's on me.

373
00:26:23.833 --> 00:26:26.083
In all those lessons,
I should have taught you

374
00:26:26.166 --> 00:26:28.791
that sometimes,
discretion is more important than valor.

375
00:26:30.583 --> 00:26:31.708
You sound like Geralt.

376
00:26:31.791 --> 00:26:33.416
Well, he isn't always wrong.

377
00:26:35.041 --> 00:26:38.500
One day, I may be queen,
and I'll need to use what I've got.

378
00:26:38.583 --> 00:26:43.208
And what I've got is a sense of justice,
a dagger and quick reflexes.

379
00:26:43.916 --> 00:26:47.458
- You and Geralt taught me those things.
- Then our teachings were incomplete.

380
00:26:47.541 --> 00:26:49.583
We should have taught you
about consequences.

381
00:26:49.666 --> 00:26:52.208
Consequences are just
an excuse not to act.

382
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:54.416
Even when someone's going to be killed.

383
00:26:54.958 --> 00:26:56.625
You didn't see that child's eyes.

384
00:26:56.708 --> 00:26:59.833
- I had to do what I did...
- No, you chose to interfere.

385
00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:05.166
That messenger in Ellander,
his fate is a mystery.

386
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.916
But I know what will happen here.

387
00:27:08.583 --> 00:27:11.208
Dominik Houvenaghel will send
his cousin Leo Bonhart here

388
00:27:11.291 --> 00:27:13.958
to recuperate his losses
with money or with blood.

389
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.416
The townspeople who do survive
will be conscripted to fight

390
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.416
against the war
that's looming on the horizon,

391
00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.708
where they'll die on the battlefield.

392
00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.708
If disease or starvation
doesn't claim them first.

393
00:27:25.666 --> 00:27:26.750
You saved one,

394
00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:30.291
and the consequence has likely
damned a hundred others in exchange.

395
00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:33.666
What is the point in me seeing the future
if I can't do anything to change it?

396
00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:44.083
Well, why would you understand?
You see what you want, you make it happen.

397
00:27:44.666 --> 00:27:46.791
You snap your fingers, mountains move.

398
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:48.833
Men bend to your will.

399
00:27:50.583 --> 00:27:53.291
How would you know what it's like
to fight for control of your life?

400
00:28:02.875 --> 00:28:04.083
Where are you going?

401
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.625
More shopping?

402
00:28:05.708 --> 00:28:08.125
No, my ugly one.

403
00:28:08.208 --> 00:28:09.541
We're taking a detour.

404
00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:12.166
Why do you call me that?

405
00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:15.958
Because I promised
I'd be sincere with you from here forward.

406
00:28:17.583 --> 00:28:18.583
Come along.

407
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.208
I want to show you who I really am.

408
00:28:36.208 --> 00:28:38.208
Where's my fucking sword?

409
00:28:42.083 --> 00:28:43.541
You're not even a fuckin' elf.

410
00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:46.583
But you'll die like one.

411
00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:59.125
You'll pay for this,
Nilfgaardian scum.

412
00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:07.250
Get up.

413
00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:11.625
Get up, old friend.

414
00:29:13.833 --> 00:29:15.041
Thanks for the save.

415
00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:17.083
You've gotten my back
more than a few times.

416
00:29:17.166 --> 00:29:18.916
It's my duty to pay back the favor.

417
00:29:20.333 --> 00:29:23.000
What the hell are you doing here?

418
00:29:27.958 --> 00:29:30.333
Francesca spouts her nonsense

419
00:29:30.416 --> 00:29:32.916
about prophecies, Hen Ichaer,

420
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.750
while the Scoia'tael die
pillaging supplies.

421
00:29:35.833 --> 00:29:39.375
All so we don't die
from hunger and frost.

422
00:29:39.458 --> 00:29:42.041
I thought all you pointies
were superstitious.

423
00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:44.333
Don't believe the legend of Elder Blood?

424
00:29:44.416 --> 00:29:45.458
Please.

425
00:29:45.541 --> 00:29:47.500
My people were building civilizations

426
00:29:47.583 --> 00:29:51.375
while you blunt-eared bastards still
thought thunder was the gods passing wind.

427
00:29:51.458 --> 00:29:53.291
I believe in facts.

428
00:29:54.166 --> 00:29:57.958
The fact is, Francesca's Hen Ichaer
is a girl from Cintra.

429
00:29:59.958 --> 00:30:00.958
Cintra?

430
00:30:01.416 --> 00:30:03.000
I saw her with my own eyes.

431
00:30:03.083 --> 00:30:05.833
Apparently, the princess
is the savior of elvenkind.

432
00:30:07.291 --> 00:30:08.958
I can't do it anymore, Cahir.

433
00:30:09.458 --> 00:30:13.375
I can't keep leading my men to die
for a cause I don't believe in.

434
00:30:14.791 --> 00:30:17.625
Ah. That's why you came back.

435
00:30:18.458 --> 00:30:22.041
You've considered my proposal
to take charge of the elves.

436
00:30:22.125 --> 00:30:24.041
Aye.

437
00:30:24.125 --> 00:30:28.208
But... there's one thing
I still don't understand.

438
00:30:29.416 --> 00:30:32.416
You. You were Emhyr's top general.

439
00:30:33.083 --> 00:30:36.208
Now he's sent you to raid caravans
on the arse end of the battle lines

440
00:30:36.291 --> 00:30:39.875
while getting the high holy shit
kicked out of you every day.

441
00:30:39.958 --> 00:30:41.250
I don't get it.

442
00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:43.333
If he's a wise man, as you say,

443
00:30:43.833 --> 00:30:46.541
why the hell's he wasting
gods-given talent like yours?

444
00:30:50.791 --> 00:30:52.166
I betrayed him.

445
00:30:53.083 --> 00:30:54.250
Lied to him.

446
00:30:55.458 --> 00:30:58.791
He trusted me to fulfill
his most sacred mission, and I failed.

447
00:30:59.791 --> 00:31:03.833
So your plan is to keep paying penance
until you're killed by Northern troops?

448
00:31:04.375 --> 00:31:07.458
He must be quite a man
to inspire such cock-eyed loyalty.

449
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:10.583
Oh, friend,
your men hold you in the same regard,

450
00:31:10.666 --> 00:31:13.500
even if you are
an old, ugly, arrogant prick.

451
00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:15.208
Bold.

452
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:18.708
Well, if I agree to your proposal,

453
00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:22.500
what does overthrowing Francesca
say about my loyalty?

454
00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:23.583
Gallatin,

455
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:28.791
you are one of the finest soldiers
I've ever fought beside.

456
00:31:28.875 --> 00:31:31.125
The White Flame will see it.

457
00:31:32.208 --> 00:31:34.750
You will help him take the North,
not Francesca.

458
00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:38.125
He earned my loyalty.

459
00:31:40.583 --> 00:31:41.916
Has she earned yours?

460
00:31:45.875 --> 00:31:47.625
You wanna hear a good joke?

461
00:31:47.708 --> 00:31:48.708
Hmm.

462
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.791
I was born

463
00:31:51.375 --> 00:31:54.416
with more power
than most could comprehend.

464
00:31:55.625 --> 00:31:58.791
Learned to bend Chaos to my will.

465
00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:02.208
Designed to live forever young

466
00:32:03.416 --> 00:32:04.500
and beautiful

467
00:32:05.333 --> 00:32:08.291
in the upper echelons of the court.

468
00:32:10.208 --> 00:32:11.750
Only to die here

469
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.875
in a wine cellar

470
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.083
with all of you.

471
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
- You know the problem with you mages?
- What?

472
00:32:21.583 --> 00:32:23.500
You're too bloody serious.

473
00:32:27.416 --> 00:32:28.875
- Yeah.
- 'S true.

474
00:32:28.958 --> 00:32:30.250
Yeah!

475
00:32:33.708 --> 00:32:36.750
Yeah, helping the Brotherhood
keep their power

476
00:32:36.833 --> 00:32:41.041
by proppin' up rotten kingdoms
is serious work.

477
00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:43.708
Won't be the case
when Nilfgaard takes over.

478
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:47.166
- Why?
- Emhyr has no use for the mages.

479
00:32:48.416 --> 00:32:49.416
Case in point.

480
00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:52.541
If I ever get out of here,

481
00:32:53.875 --> 00:32:55.625
I'll play that game much smarter.

482
00:32:56.958 --> 00:32:58.958
I saw a man try to escape once.

483
00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:02.083
They sent the dogs after him.

484
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.833
Tore him limb from limb.

485
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.208
The Emperor only absolves you

486
00:33:10.708 --> 00:33:13.375
once you're dead, love.

487
00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:22.916
Hey.

488
00:33:26.291 --> 00:33:27.666
Ah.

489
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.916
Hey!

490
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.500
We got another one.

491
00:33:33.583 --> 00:33:34.625
What...

492
00:33:35.166 --> 00:33:36.166
He's...

493
00:33:38.291 --> 00:33:41.291
Put him in the bag.
The lads will help me throw him out.

494
00:33:50.125 --> 00:33:51.416
Oh, come on.

495
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.625

Thank you so much. Thank you.

516
00:35:22.416 --> 00:35:23.791
Thank you.

517
00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:26.416
- And you.
- That was just incredible.

518
00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:28.333
Oh, I am so...

519
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.250
Come on...

520
00:35:36.458 --> 00:35:37.458
That was...

521
00:35:40.333 --> 00:35:41.375
I've never...

522
00:35:45.958 --> 00:35:46.958
Uh...

523
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:49.500
Forgive me, I'm speechless.
Blame the mead.

524
00:35:49.583 --> 00:35:51.750
I would, except you're not drunk.

525
00:35:53.666 --> 00:35:54.916
It's all in the eyes.

526
00:35:55.458 --> 00:35:56.833
They're not glassy.

527
00:35:57.541 --> 00:36:01.041
Busking in seedy taverns
teaches great lessons in the art

528
00:36:01.708 --> 00:36:03.250
of pretending to be pissed

529
00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:06.250
when you have to keep your wits about you.

530
00:36:06.333 --> 00:36:10.041
And... in a vipers' den such
as this, well...

531
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:15.041
Will you see about Rience or not?

532
00:36:17.583 --> 00:36:20.958
I always wondered what it was
that made your songs so irresistible.

533
00:36:22.583 --> 00:36:23.958
Now I understand.

534
00:36:24.041 --> 00:36:25.208
Oh, yeah?

535
00:36:25.875 --> 00:36:26.875
And what's that?

536
00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:31.000
You see people

537
00:36:32.208 --> 00:36:34.916
for what they are,
not what they pretend to be.

538
00:36:36.916 --> 00:36:38.625
Well, that's part of it, at least.

539
00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:42.375
And the rest?

540
00:36:45.708 --> 00:36:46.791
I don't know yet.

541
00:36:48.375 --> 00:36:50.250
But I'm determined to figure it out.

542
00:36:53.083 --> 00:36:55.041
And in the meantime, I will dig around

543
00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:57.333
about this Rience character
and his cohorts.

544
00:36:59.833 --> 00:37:00.833
Thank you.

545
00:37:09.916 --> 00:37:12.208
Does the witcher know
how lucky he is to have you?

546
00:37:37.416 --> 00:37:39.750
Listen.
Someone's coming.

547
00:37:39.833 --> 00:37:41.833
Someone's coming.
...coming...

548
00:37:42.291 --> 00:37:43.833
Someone's coming!

549
00:37:44.666 --> 00:37:46.583
- ...coming...
- Someone's coming!

550
00:37:47.666 --> 00:37:49.250
- Someone's coming...
- Shh...

551
00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:51.125
- What time is it?
- Shhhh...

552
00:38:04.375 --> 00:38:07.708
- Please. Come help us.
- He'll come back for us. He always does.

553
00:38:07.791 --> 00:38:09.166
- Help us!
- Please, just once!

554
00:38:09.250 --> 00:38:10.666
Help me!

555
00:38:12.583 --> 00:38:14.750
Help me, please! Please!

556
00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:16.875
- Can you help us?
- Please, he'll be back soon.

557
00:38:16.958 --> 00:38:18.500
- I can't feel anything.
- Please.

558
00:38:18.583 --> 00:38:20.416
- I can't...
- Please. Come back.

559
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.125
- Help us. Please, please.
- I don't want to die here...

560
00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:25.625
Help me!

561
00:38:25.708 --> 00:38:26.708
Help me!

562
00:38:27.333 --> 00:38:30.083
Help me... help me!

563
00:38:31.083 --> 00:38:33.583
- Help!
- I won't hurt you.

564
00:38:34.541 --> 00:38:35.708
Are you all right?

565
00:38:37.916 --> 00:38:39.583
Are there any more like you here?

566
00:38:40.916 --> 00:38:42.541
So many.

567
00:38:43.583 --> 00:38:44.708
More and more.

568
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.291
Please...

569
00:38:51.083 --> 00:38:52.291
He comes for us.

570
00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:54.083
In the night.

571
00:38:54.166 --> 00:38:56.291
- Stop him.
- He has to be stopped!

572
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.625
- Make him stop, please.
- The man you're speaking of...

573
00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:02.416
Make him... come back...

574
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.125
Was his name Rience?

575
00:39:04.625 --> 00:39:07.250
Elven scum.

576
00:39:08.666 --> 00:39:10.833
- Always a source.
- Shhh!

577
00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:40.875
No! No!

578
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.166
Why are you hurting us?

579
00:40:00.875 --> 00:40:02.434
- No!
- Make him stop!

580
00:40:02.458 --> 00:40:04.041
Don't let him kill us!

581
00:40:12.375 --> 00:40:13.708
Don't kill us!

582
00:40:15.083 --> 00:40:16.916
It's too late. Go!

583
00:41:27.083 --> 00:41:29.125
All that wine just makes them heavier.

584
00:41:39.583 --> 00:41:41.708
Rest in peace, motherfucker.

585
00:41:59.791 --> 00:42:01.041
Cor!

586
00:42:29.625 --> 00:42:32.041
They all thought the baker
was an innocent bystander,

587
00:42:32.125 --> 00:42:34.250
but I told them,
he was the contortionist's aim

588
00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:35.875
right from the beginning!

589
00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:41.916
Uh... but speaking of things
that go bump in the night,

590
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.041
did I ever tell you about the time I saw
a young elf leaving Virfuril's bedchamber?

591
00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:49.208
- Darling, Virfuril is a frivolous fool.
- Hmm.

592
00:42:49.291 --> 00:42:53.166
- What would I do without you, darling?
- Well, clearly not much, darling.

593
00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.208
- Eva, more meat.
- Yes, m'lady.

594
00:42:55.791 --> 00:42:58.500
He said that he was there
for an interrogation.

595
00:42:58.583 --> 00:43:01.458
Well, torture would explain
the sounds I heard.

596
00:43:05.708 --> 00:43:08.188
I just had the most intriguing visit
from the witcher's friend.

597
00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:11.041
He seems to think those old farts
Codringher and Fenn

598
00:43:11.125 --> 00:43:12.791
might have some info about Rience.

599
00:43:12.875 --> 00:43:13.875
And?

600
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.583
And I'm wondering if perhaps
our methods of obtaining the girl

601
00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:19.958
would be more easily achieved
with a carrot than a stick.

602
00:43:20.041 --> 00:43:21.791
How very interesting.

603
00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:25.416
Perhaps I need
to pay those old farts a visit too, hmm?

604
00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.958
Passing me, same passage!

605
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:30.625
Picture the elf,
standing in the snow, belt unbuckled,

606
00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:32.916
a delicious look of guilt across his face.

607
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.541
Now, being the fair-minded king that I am,
I said, "I'll give you a head start,

608
00:43:36.625 --> 00:43:38.291
but you are due an arrow in the bum."

609
00:43:38.375 --> 00:43:40.041
Now, I yell "Go,"

610
00:43:40.125 --> 00:43:42.125
he scuttles off like a wounded deer,

611
00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:44.041
and then I shot the elf, like this.

612
00:43:44.125 --> 00:43:45.166
Hold still, I say.

613
00:43:45.958 --> 00:43:48.041
Yeah!

614
00:43:48.791 --> 00:43:50.666
Aplegatt! You lucky bastard!

615
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.833
- Ah.
- What word do you bring?

616
00:43:53.375 --> 00:43:56.666
Now, have I ever told you
about the first time...

617
00:43:57.416 --> 00:44:00.416
You don't seem to be enjoying
my brother's epic tales of derring-do.

618
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.458
- Aplegatt was...
- Hmm. I've heard this tale before.

619
00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:06.351
- It doesn't improve by repetition.
- But that's another story!

620
00:44:06.375 --> 00:44:08.541
Alas, my brother's not renowned
for his wit.

621
00:44:09.583 --> 00:44:12.875
Philippa seems to think that you might
have more wit than meets the eye.

622
00:44:13.708 --> 00:44:15.628
...when, through the branches,
I see...

623
00:44:15.708 --> 00:44:17.958
- Or not.
- ...dark-furred...

624
00:44:18.666 --> 00:44:20.041
Surely, as Redania's spymaster,

625
00:44:20.125 --> 00:44:23.166
you must realize that everyone
in this room's hiding something.

626
00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:27.083
Even those like my brother,
who seem to be witless.

627
00:44:27.166 --> 00:44:29.208
Vizimir has no secrets from me.

628
00:44:29.291 --> 00:44:31.541
Then you do know
about his meeting last night?

629
00:44:33.416 --> 00:44:35.083
With Nilfgaard.

630
00:44:47.125 --> 00:44:48.500
Did you hear something?

631
00:44:48.583 --> 00:44:49.916
- No.
- Really?

632
00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:51.666
Nothing.

633
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:55.166
Why am I even asking? You're going deaf.

634
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:56.250
I'll have you...

635
00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.916
- Heard you had a visitor.
- We have lots of...

636
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.640
You know who I mean.

637
00:45:02.708 --> 00:45:03.750
The witcher was here.

638
00:45:03.833 --> 00:45:06.125
I can still smell his stench.
What did you tell him?

639
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:11.000
Don't worry. We didn't mention
anything about your employer.

640
00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:15.291
Or what he's really got planned
for Cirilla of Cintra.

641
00:45:16.125 --> 00:45:18.166
What do you know about his plans?

642
00:45:24.416 --> 00:45:25.458
Huh.

643
00:45:32.666 --> 00:45:34.041
Please. Not the cat!

644
00:45:34.125 --> 00:45:35.416
Tell me everything.

645
00:46:01.458 --> 00:46:04.791
So... are you going to let
Yennefer come home?

646
00:46:04.875 --> 00:46:07.833
Let her? She's already on her way.

647
00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:11.208
Of course she is.

648
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:15.000
With an agenda, no doubt.

649
00:46:16.916 --> 00:46:18.208
Hmm?

650
00:46:20.166 --> 00:46:23.708
Oh, she's as fair-weathered
as the fog over this island.

651
00:46:26.541 --> 00:46:27.958
Triss is right.

652
00:46:29.666 --> 00:46:31.291
Gods forbid, Stregobor too.

653
00:46:32.208 --> 00:46:35.000
We need to get the Northern kings
to listen to us and work together.

654
00:46:35.083 --> 00:46:36.403
The last thing they'd want to see

655
00:46:36.458 --> 00:46:39.083
is the woman
who set their execution party ablaze.

656
00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:44.458
But you love her.

657
00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:50.875
I think your mind
is struggling to catch up

658
00:46:51.458 --> 00:46:53.666
with the decision
your heart's already made.

659
00:46:55.291 --> 00:46:57.000
You head the Council with me.

660
00:46:57.833 --> 00:46:59.125
How do you feel?

661
00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:03.208
Gods know you weren't fond of her.

662
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.666
That's only because
we have too much in common.

663
00:47:08.291 --> 00:47:09.958
- Bad tempers.
- Hmm.

664
00:47:10.916 --> 00:47:12.208
Impetuousness.

665
00:47:13.291 --> 00:47:15.416
The overwhelming need to win an argument.

666
00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:22.958
And we have one other thing in common.

667
00:47:26.166 --> 00:47:27.166
Our love

668
00:47:28.875 --> 00:47:29.875
for you.

669
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:47.125
If Yennefer can let go of the past,

670
00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:49.333
so can I.

671
00:47:56.375 --> 00:47:58.958
- What's this?
- An old superstition.

672
00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:02.500
The stones are rumored
to have protective abilities.

673
00:48:05.291 --> 00:48:07.375
You could just tell me
you were thinking of me.

674
00:48:19.458 --> 00:48:21.166
I'll meet Yennefer at Gors Velen.

675
00:48:21.833 --> 00:48:23.708
Make sure she's not bringing trouble.

676
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.458
Our detour was to a field.

677
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:56.166
A house used to stand here.

678
00:48:58.166 --> 00:48:59.291
My house.

679
00:49:02.333 --> 00:49:03.833
This is where I grew up.

680
00:49:14.416 --> 00:49:16.096
Get out of there, girl!

681
00:49:16.125 --> 00:49:17.708
I can do it!

682
00:49:17.791 --> 00:49:19.041
How much for a pig?

683
00:49:19.125 --> 00:49:20.291
How much for this beast?

684
00:49:20.375 --> 00:49:21.666
She's our daughter!

685
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:23.250
She's no daughter of mine.

686
00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:24.666
You can't take me!

687
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.291
I won't go.

688
00:49:26.375 --> 00:49:29.416
Don't you dare take your eyes off me.

689
00:49:30.916 --> 00:49:33.875
You do not have a choice.

690
00:49:39.416 --> 00:49:43.333
My whole life I've had so much power.

691
00:49:45.625 --> 00:49:47.375
But I've never been perfect.

692
00:49:47.875 --> 00:49:50.250
I fought with Tissaia
every step of the way.

693
00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:53.375
I wanted to do things my way.

694
00:49:54.916 --> 00:49:55.916
That letter?

695
00:49:57.291 --> 00:50:00.083
I don't know
if I'll be welcomed back to Aretuza.

696
00:50:01.125 --> 00:50:03.083
Like you, I once chose to interfere.

697
00:50:04.666 --> 00:50:06.125
I set a prisoner free.

698
00:50:07.666 --> 00:50:10.958
And in doing so, I set the entire North
against the Brotherhood.

699
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.958
And the Brotherhood against each other.

700
00:50:16.708 --> 00:50:19.083
Those bodies hanging at the tavern.

701
00:50:21.666 --> 00:50:23.041
All those executions.

702
00:50:23.125 --> 00:50:25.750
The whole Continent
is paying the consequences.

703
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
And you.

704
00:50:30.166 --> 00:50:31.166
Because of me.

705
00:50:33.458 --> 00:50:35.416
It's not enough to possess Chaos.

706
00:50:35.916 --> 00:50:36.916
You and I,

707
00:50:38.125 --> 00:50:39.791
we must learn to control it.

708
00:50:39.875 --> 00:50:41.750
That is the essence of power.

709
00:50:43.291 --> 00:50:45.750
That is how we will move mountains.

710
00:50:47.916 --> 00:50:48.916
Together.

711
00:50:51.916 --> 00:50:52.916
Come along,

712
00:50:54.666 --> 00:50:55.791
Ciri.

713
00:51:32.583 --> 00:51:33.583
Hmm.

714
00:51:34.833 --> 00:51:36.208
Hello?

715
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.541
You're out of that place now. You're safe.

716
00:51:48.083 --> 00:51:49.166
Are you all right?

717
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.916
I knew you'd come for me.

718
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.125
And how'd you know that?

719
00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:01.750
Because you always do.

720
00:52:04.916 --> 00:52:06.708
We're tied by destiny.

721
00:52:10.583 --> 00:52:11.666
Who are you?

722
00:52:13.083 --> 00:52:14.250
Don't be silly, Geralt.

723
00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:16.375
You know who I am.

724
00:52:18.166 --> 00:52:19.375
I'm Ciri.
