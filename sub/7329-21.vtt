WEBVTT

00:09.645 --> 00:13.215
Got a heart attack.
BP 88/62, pulse 98.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.914
All right. Okay, steady, steady.

00:15.939 --> 00:17.442
Place him down.

00:17.467 --> 00:18.627
- You got him?
- Got him.

00:22.084 --> 00:24.453
- Look out!
- Oh, my God!

00:24.478 --> 00:26.179
Move out of the way!

00:26.204 --> 00:28.434
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:09.078 --> 01:10.479
Ziva?

01:10.504 --> 01:13.817
You remember Brenda Bittner?

01:13.841 --> 01:15.585
Well, the name sounds familiar.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.020
You friended her.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.256
She... she's a barista
at Gibbs' coffee shop?

01:19.280 --> 01:21.158
Oh, yeah. Brenda.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.325
I'm reading her profile now.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.494
She just posted that she is

01:24.518 --> 01:27.431
in a committed relationship
with Tony DiNozzo.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.599
Our Tony DiNozzo?

01:29.623 --> 01:31.459
Sure looks like him.
Look at her home page.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.007
Well, how long
has this been going on?

01:37.031 --> 01:38.608
How long's what been going on?

01:38.632 --> 01:40.877
When were you going to tell us?

01:40.901 --> 01:44.138
- Tell you what?
- That you are in a committed relationship.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.285
With who?

01:48.309 --> 01:51.938
The ever-lovely Brenda Bittner.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.391
Where did you hear that?

01:54.415 --> 01:57.694
She posted it
at 7:14 a.m. this morning.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.297
I left her place around 7:00.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.998
How long have you two
been dating?

02:02.022 --> 02:03.333
Well... no, we're not dating.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.634
Last night was it.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.303
Well, it must have been
one hell of an it

02:06.327 --> 02:08.972
because she cannot wait
to tell all of her friends.

02:08.996 --> 02:12.275
Well, how many friends
can she possibly have?

02:12.299 --> 02:13.710
2,412.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.445
She is very popular.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.596
Gee.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.717
Oh, no.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.120
Can she post this
without my permission?

02:23.144 --> 02:25.322
Depends on
your privacy settings, Tony.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.290
Well, obviously,
I haven't got them set right.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.092
Will you get over here,
McGeek, and

02:29.116 --> 02:31.161
- make this go away, please?
- Tony, you know,

02:31.185 --> 02:33.563
you're getting way too old
for these one-night stands.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.265
Your biological clock
is ticking.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.867
Men don't have
biological clocks.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.869
When I meet Ms. Right...

02:38.893 --> 02:40.604
I'll be ready to settle down.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.073
Don't ever settle, DiNozzo.

02:43.097 --> 02:44.508
Dead lieutenant,

02:44.532 --> 02:45.509
Monroe University Hospital.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.843
Let's go.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.645
- Was he sick long?
- No.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.001
Never got admitted.

02:53.207 --> 02:56.753
Victim is Lieutenant
Jeffrey Wilton Hutton.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.488
He's attached to NIOC.

02:58.512 --> 03:02.058
He's living in base housing
at the Anacostia NSF.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.460
Parents are deceased.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.828
Next of kin?

03:04.852 --> 03:07.731
A sister. I'm gonna go try
and track her down.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.666
So what exactly
are you looking for

03:09.690 --> 03:11.825
in Ms. Right?

03:13.260 --> 03:15.572
Well, aside from the obvious,
uh, physical requirements...

03:15.596 --> 03:17.274
I don't know.

03:17.298 --> 03:20.443
I guess she'd be a...
very independent woman.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.480
Intelligent, successful.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.282
A professional.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.616
Okay, just one question.

03:26.640 --> 03:31.339
What would this woman
possibly see in you?

03:33.981 --> 03:36.359
Yes, well, I can assure you

03:36.383 --> 03:37.561
of one thing.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.663
Car crash was not
the cause of death.

03:39.687 --> 03:40.830
What was?

03:40.854 --> 03:42.566
Well, I haven't
the faintest idea.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.701
I mean, there are no contusions,

03:44.725 --> 03:46.469
no obvious signs of trauma.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.471
I mean, the poor lieutenant...

03:48.495 --> 03:50.140
I doubt he was here
to visit someone.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.142
But he must have had

03:52.166 --> 03:53.343
an egregious ailment.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.879
I mean, he was
in a hell of a hurry

03:55.903 --> 03:57.347
to get himself to the hospital.

03:57.371 --> 04:01.151
Figured that out myself, Duck.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.452
Appreciate the help.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.154
- We done here?
- I am.

04:04.178 --> 04:06.823
Uh, Lieutenant Hutton's
sister's name is Dana.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.158
Wait. Dana Hutton?

04:08.182 --> 04:10.360
Yeah. I just got off
the phone with...

04:10.384 --> 04:11.595
ZNN reporter?

04:11.619 --> 04:12.996
Yes.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.631
David?

04:14.655 --> 04:18.435
Just got off the phone
with her producer.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.637
He says that she's been working
at home today.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.340
Wow. Dana Hutton.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.475
I would really like
to interview her, boss.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.932
Sure.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.334
Take Ziva with you.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.149
You know

04:33.173 --> 04:34.718
who she is.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.353
She did that, uh, great piece

04:36.377 --> 04:38.154
on Doctors Without Borders
in Darfur.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.657
Embedded with that marine unit
in Kandahar last year.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.259
Okay, what does she look like?

04:42.283 --> 04:43.860
Blonde. Cute. Real cute.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.663
Looks even better
in a helmet and flak jacket.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.198
Okay, Tony,
do I have to remind you

04:48.222 --> 04:49.933
that her brother just died?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.302
I'm a professional.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.604
- What?
- Brenda Bittner.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.308
Yeah! I guess she saw
I changed my dating status.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.698
Well, you cannot
avoid her forever.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.453
Well, I guess she's not home.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.605
Looks like we got
probable cause.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.622
Ms. Hutton?

05:38.639 --> 05:40.504
Clear!

05:46.313 --> 05:49.392
Ms. Hutton did not do this
to her own place.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.394
No.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.749
Where is she?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.908
Someone tossed
the place pretty good,

06:05.932 --> 06:07.076
looking for something.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.678
Metro's processing
her apartment.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.214
They are going to coordinate
their investigation with us.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.548
Already put out a BOLO.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.117
Dana Hutton

06:14.141 --> 06:15.218
should be easy to spot.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.452
She's pretty well known.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.121
Do we assume
her disappearance is related

06:18.145 --> 06:19.856
- to her brother's death?
- No.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.190
We don't assume anything.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.191
Jeffrey and Dana Hutton.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.626
Military brats.

06:23.650 --> 06:24.861
Their father was

06:24.885 --> 06:26.796
a marine combat
helicopter pilot.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.031
Died at the age of 42
in a training exercise.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.566
They were raised
by their mother.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.770
Died five years ago
of pancreatic cancer.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.538
Overachievers, both of them.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.241
He played water polo
and lacrosse at the academy.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.543
Did a tour at the Pacific,
spent a year

06:40.567 --> 06:42.712
at the Pentagon
before they moved him to

06:42.736 --> 06:46.249
Navy Information
Operations Command.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.984
NIOC. Secret stuff.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.086
Wonder what he was working on.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.387
I'll know in three minutes.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.356
Talking to his C.O. in MTAC.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.957
Dana.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.760
Impressive woman.

06:57.784 --> 07:02.131
Won a piano competition
when she was 13 years old.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.100
Phi Beta Kappa graduate

07:04.124 --> 07:05.968
of Georgetown before joining ZNN

07:05.992 --> 07:08.805
at the age of 22.

07:08.829 --> 07:12.074
Boss, went through
Lieutenant Hutton's residence.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.609
Nothing. Dropped off

07:13.633 --> 07:15.268
his laptop with Abby.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.382
Yeah. Gibbs.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.616
Yeah. On my way.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.006
Let's go, McGee.

07:29.449 --> 07:34.263
Multiple organ failure,
but no apparent reason.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.265
You seem perplexed, Dr. Mallard.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.600
Oh, I am.

07:37.624 --> 07:39.802
I'm just reviewing
Lieutenant Hutton's

07:39.826 --> 07:41.504
physical, taken only last week.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.039
The man is in perfect health.

07:43.063 --> 07:47.710
I'm about to take blood
and tissue samples up to Abby.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.812
Should I have her look
for anything specific?

07:49.836 --> 07:51.881
Well, that is my dilemma,
Mr. Palmer.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.716
I wouldn't know
what to tell her.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.484
Or Gibbs, for that matter,

07:55.508 --> 07:59.035
when he comes calling,
as he undoubtedly will.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.493
Gibbs.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.629
Captain Austin Sears.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.465
Have to assume
this is about Lieutenant Hutton?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.234
What happened?

08:11.258 --> 08:12.468
Was it an accident?

08:12.492 --> 08:15.004
I don't know.
What can you tell me about him?

08:15.028 --> 08:16.172
Good officer.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.574
Hard-working, smart.

08:18.598 --> 08:19.876
Maybe too smart.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.544
What does that mean?

08:21.568 --> 08:23.179
Was a politician.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.548
Knew how to work the system.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.917
Had a master plan.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.052
His career wasn't going
to end here.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.554
What was he working on?

08:31.578 --> 08:33.155
A classified project.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.558
We've got clearance.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.159
Not for this one.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.594
Can't read you into the program

08:38.618 --> 08:40.029
unless it's cleared
by SECNAV himself.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.265
I'll make the call.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.554
I suggest
you have your director do it.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.597
Gee, what a sweet guy.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.947
Doesn't DiNozzo have
a buddy at NIOC?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.416
We can talk in here.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.418
After you called this morning,

09:02.442 --> 09:05.254
I tried to track Dana down
but couldn't find her.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.656
What's going on?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.225
Um, we need to talk to her.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.893
Is this about the naval officer

09:10.917 --> 09:13.262
who died in the car accident
this morning?

09:13.286 --> 09:14.764
Came across our news desk.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.934
Yes. That was her brother.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.168
Wow.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.437
Um... that's horrible.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.072
And ironic.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.473
What are the odds?

09:24.497 --> 09:25.942
Of what?

09:25.966 --> 09:28.110
An old friend and mentor
of Dana's was killed

09:28.134 --> 09:29.779
in a car accident two weeks ago.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.081
Is it unusual
for her not to come in?

09:32.105 --> 09:34.250
Yes, but she's been distracted.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.885
She's the executor
of her friend's estate

09:35.909 --> 09:38.421
and had to get involved
in the sale of the business...

09:38.445 --> 09:39.822
an old bookstore
in Dupont Circle.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.258
Shouldn't she check in with you?

09:42.282 --> 09:44.093
I mean, you're her boss, right?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.394
I'm not her boss.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.296
I'm her segment producer.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.732
She's... the star.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.233
Gets to choose
her own assignments.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.936
What is she working on now?

09:53.960 --> 09:57.940
She was doing a piece about
private military companies.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.742
But the last few days,

09:59.766 --> 10:01.811
she started researching
the old Soviet KGB.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.113
I told her that was
yesterday's news.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.082
Bet you couldn't talk her
out of it.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.550
No.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.852
Um, when Dana's passionate
about something, she can lose

10:09.876 --> 10:11.487
objectivity.

10:11.511 --> 10:14.123
Does she have any friends
who may know where she is?

10:14.147 --> 10:15.925
I don't know.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.493
Our relationship's
all about work.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.828
She have a boyfriend?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.629
Uh, wouldn't know.

10:20.653 --> 10:22.698
All right,
could you give us a call

10:22.722 --> 10:25.034
if you hear from her?

10:25.058 --> 10:27.103
Sure.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.138
All right, well,

10:29.162 --> 10:31.153
we'll find our own way out.
Thanks.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.413
Mr. Rivera's with the
Justice Department in Mexico.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.781
He's here in Washington

10:38.805 --> 10:40.983
to set up an international
law enforcement task force.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.251
I am sure you know

10:42.275 --> 10:45.021
our country is in the middle
of a horrible drug war.

10:45.045 --> 10:47.523
We are desperate for help.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.358
It is imperative
that our countries continue

10:49.382 --> 10:51.816
to share techniques
and intelligence.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.422
I'll do what I can do.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.534
Excuse me.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.436
Yes?

11:00.460 --> 11:03.039
Oh, send her in.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.826
Hello, gentlemen.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.292
I'm sorry I'm late.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.981
Hello, Mr. Gibbs.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.449
The State Department

11:13.473 --> 11:15.684
has appointed Ms. Hart
to be Alejandro's legal counsel

11:15.708 --> 11:17.177
for the task force.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.455
Of course they did.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.890
I met Allison in Mexico City.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.392
We work well together.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.760
Alejandro was very helpful

11:24.784 --> 11:27.129
in my securing Colonel Bell's
release from prison.

11:27.153 --> 11:30.350
Maybe we shouldn't be
cooperating, Leon.

11:32.725 --> 11:35.728
Mr. Gibbs has
a strange sense of humor.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.012
Oh, I'll be spending a lot
of time on the project.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.181
Director Vance
kindly extended me

11:45.205 --> 11:47.196
temporary employee status.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.922
Abby.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.091
How we doing on
Lieutenant Hutton's tox screen?

11:55.115 --> 11:56.225
We?

11:56.249 --> 11:57.460
Get in line, Palmer.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.195
I've ruled out

11:59.219 --> 12:01.797
all common viruses,
biological agents, and drugs.

12:01.821 --> 12:03.032
You didn't give me
any directions.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.900
This is going to take time.
Now, go,

12:04.924 --> 12:06.302
scram, leave me alone.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.537
McGee is bugging me
to analyze the contents

12:08.561 --> 12:09.972
of the hard drive
of this laptop.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.107
That's a terabyte.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.575
Do you know how large that is?

12:12.599 --> 12:13.876
Um...

12:13.900 --> 12:15.344
Hey.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.812
Uh, she's in a foul mood again.

12:16.836 --> 12:20.483
Palmer, I have guns
in my ballistics lab

12:20.507 --> 12:21.633
and I know how to use 'em.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.922
Did Metro send

12:26.946 --> 12:30.426
the fingerprints lifted
from Dana Hutton's condo?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.694
Yes.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.195
And?

12:33.219 --> 12:34.630
And I haven't gotten
to them yet.

12:34.654 --> 12:37.833
When I have answers,
I will call you.

12:37.857 --> 12:39.235
Now, out!

12:39.259 --> 12:41.250
Both of you.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.474
Oh, hey, congratulations.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.475
Whoo!

12:46.499 --> 12:47.943
For what?

12:47.967 --> 12:49.712
Hooking up with Brenda Bittner.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.847
Breena and I would love
to double with you.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.136
Do you guys have plans
Saturday night?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.168
McGee.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.490
Well, I will see you

13:01.514 --> 13:03.425
tomorrow, Mr. Gibbs.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.927
This is going to be fun,

13:04.951 --> 13:06.646
at least for me.

13:09.155 --> 13:10.823
Anything?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.203
Been checking Dana Hutton's
credit cards, phone activity.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.504
Nothing here, boss.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.774
DiNozzo make contact
with his buddy from NIOC yet?

13:18.798 --> 13:19.775
I don't know.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.277
Where is he?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.879
No idea.

13:23.903 --> 13:26.549
I have
such admiration for authors

13:26.573 --> 13:27.917
like yourself.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.285
There's this bookshop

13:29.309 --> 13:33.122
here in Washington, DC
that was my refuge as a child.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.390
I spent hours there

13:34.414 --> 13:35.949
curled up on an old couch
with a book.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.861
I hope one of mine.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.162
Yeah, my mom didn't think

13:40.186 --> 13:43.156
you were proper reading material
for a young lady.

13:51.030 --> 13:53.275
Supposedly the insurgents
had left the area,

13:53.299 --> 13:55.344
but that's clearly not the case.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.846
They've gathered on top
of this ridge ahead of us,

13:57.870 --> 13:58.938
heavily armed...

14:00.515 --> 14:01.983
We're taking fire.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.819
Let's go.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.054
Come on.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.056
We need this shot. Follow me.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.224
Dana, come back!

14:08.248 --> 14:10.239
Come on.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.702
DiNozzo, you talk
to your friend at NIOC?

14:20.726 --> 14:23.038
Uh, been playing
phone tag, boss.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.606
ZNN is going

14:24.630 --> 14:27.275
to break the story
on Dana Hutton and her brother.

14:27.299 --> 14:28.739
I'm surprised
they held it this long.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.718
Give me her number.

14:36.742 --> 14:38.153
Whose?

14:38.177 --> 14:39.921
- Dana.
- Nope.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.790
- I would like the number, please.
- I've been monitoring

14:41.814 --> 14:43.859
her cell phone, Tony;
It is not on.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.351
Give me the number
or I'll Gibbs-slap you.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.474
Boss, there's a bookstore

14:59.498 --> 15:00.809
where Dana used to hang out

15:00.833 --> 15:02.044
when she was a kid.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.546
She'd go there
when things were bothering her.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.471
- How do you know that?
- It's called research, David.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.885
The owner died
in a highway accident.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.054
Dana is the executor
of his estate

15:12.078 --> 15:13.488
and is trying to sell the store.

15:13.512 --> 15:14.723
I think I should
go check it out.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.992
Friend killed accidentally.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.394
Healthy brother dies
of unknown causes.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.596
She disappears.

15:21.620 --> 15:25.067
I think we're setting a record
here for coincidences.

15:25.091 --> 15:28.670
Ziva, background
the bookstore owner.

15:28.694 --> 15:31.106
Get the details
on his car accident.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.121
Okay.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.752
May I inquire
what the lieutenant is doing

15:43.776 --> 15:46.021
back on the table, Mr. Palmer?

15:46.045 --> 15:48.857
Dr. Mallard, uh, you seemed
so worried last night

15:48.881 --> 15:50.425
that I thought, well,

15:50.449 --> 15:52.094
uh, maybe, um,

15:52.118 --> 15:53.462
I wonder if it wouldn't be
a good idea

15:53.486 --> 15:56.080
for me to come in early
and, uh...

15:57.523 --> 16:00.435
Are you upset?

16:00.459 --> 16:03.395
Don't be silly.
I admire your initiative.

16:05.364 --> 16:07.342
You found something.

16:07.366 --> 16:10.112
Yeah, the left trapezius muscle.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.047
There is a one-millimeter,
perfectly round dot

16:12.071 --> 16:13.682
which at first glance
appears to be

16:13.706 --> 16:16.742
an imperfection
on the film, but...

16:20.112 --> 16:21.723
there is

16:21.747 --> 16:25.615
a corresponding mark
on the lieutenant's shoulder.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.865
Well, let's see what it is.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.867
I've prepared
your instruments for you.

16:31.891 --> 16:34.536
No, no, no,
this is all yours, Mr. Palmer.

16:34.560 --> 16:39.054
Allow me to assist.

16:50.609 --> 16:54.101
Uh, twe... tweezers.

17:01.620 --> 17:05.066
What on earth is that?

17:05.089 --> 17:06.935
Looks like a teeny-tiny
bowling ball.

17:06.959 --> 17:07.935
What is it?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.238
Uh... you got me.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.874
Has me and Dr. Mallard
baffled, too.

17:12.897 --> 17:15.924
Okay, well, I will add this
to my to-do list.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.925
Abby? Abby?

17:29.949 --> 17:32.417
Abby!

17:33.319 --> 17:35.363
Oh, Ms. Hart.

17:35.387 --> 17:36.865
I'd like for you to meet...

17:36.889 --> 17:38.800
Señor Alejandro Rivera.

17:38.824 --> 17:41.803
I read about your visit
on the interoffice e-mail.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.205
Encantado.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.739
I have been looking forward
to meeting you, Ms. Sciuto.

17:44.763 --> 17:47.309
You are a legend in the field
of forensic science.

17:47.333 --> 17:50.645
- Aw, shucks.
- I was wondering

17:50.669 --> 17:53.048
if you could give Mr. Rivera
a quick tour of your lab.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.817
I would love to,

17:55.841 --> 17:59.221
but I am just...
I am way too busy.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.223
Mr. Rivera
is on a very tight schedule.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.992
He's only going to be
in Washington for one more day.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.994
Well, maybe next time.

18:06.018 --> 18:06.995
Ms. Sciuto...

18:07.019 --> 18:08.330
Ms. Sciuto is

18:08.354 --> 18:09.931
obviously very busy.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.399
I appreciate your work ethic.

18:11.423 --> 18:13.468
I wish I had someone like you
on my team.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.837
Muchas gracias.

18:15.861 --> 18:16.929
Por nada.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.438
That sounds nice, man.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.665
Mr. DiNozzo?

18:43.689 --> 18:45.834
Maggie Reed.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.951
Hi.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.674
I hope you're not insulted,
but you don't look like someone

18:52.698 --> 18:54.466
who would be buying
a used bookstore.

18:55.634 --> 18:56.811
I'm not.

18:56.835 --> 18:58.029
NCIS.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.652
You're here about Dana.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.287
I heard it on the TV
this morning.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.556
They said she was missing
and her brother died?

19:08.580 --> 19:10.992
What's going on?

19:11.016 --> 19:14.696
I tried to call her
a couple of times yesterday.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.097
How well do you know 'em?

19:16.121 --> 19:17.799
I didn't know Jeffrey,

19:17.823 --> 19:19.534
but I'm a patron
of the bookstore,

19:19.558 --> 19:22.003
so I've seen Dana here
over the years.

19:22.027 --> 19:25.140
Charley Bascom, the owner...
he was like a father to her.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.075
She took his death very hard.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.176
Is that Charley up there?

19:28.200 --> 19:29.411
Yes.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.846
I understand
Dana is handling his estate.

19:31.870 --> 19:32.847
Yes, she approached me

19:32.871 --> 19:35.250
last week at Charley's funeral.

19:35.274 --> 19:38.119
Asked me if I would help
with the sale of the business.

19:38.143 --> 19:40.588
His will instructs
that the proceeds go

19:40.612 --> 19:43.458
to a charity promoting literacy
for children.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.193
So Charley.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.762
Is this place worth much?

19:47.786 --> 19:49.798
If you were a potential buyer,
I'd say yes,

19:49.822 --> 19:52.100
but, uh, to be honest,

19:52.124 --> 19:54.035
there's less than a year left
on the lease.

19:54.059 --> 19:59.007
Everybody's getting
electronic readers.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.642
Books are a dying business.

20:00.666 --> 20:03.144
Dana used to curl up
on this couch.

20:03.168 --> 20:04.312
You know her?

20:04.336 --> 20:07.248
No, uh...

20:07.272 --> 20:08.416
You mind?

20:08.440 --> 20:10.431
No.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.930
This safe always open?

20:21.954 --> 20:23.898
I have no idea.

20:23.922 --> 20:27.085
I don't think Charley had
much of value to lock up.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.075
Captain,

20:34.099 --> 20:36.411
you hear from SECNAV?

20:36.435 --> 20:38.480
- Yes.
- So...

20:38.504 --> 20:40.982
what was Lieutenant Hutton
working on?

20:41.006 --> 20:44.352
A report for a very select
group of people:

20:44.376 --> 20:45.620
The Joint Chiefs.

20:45.644 --> 20:48.356
About?

20:48.380 --> 20:49.991
Private military companies.

20:50.015 --> 20:51.626
There's been a lot
of negative reaction

20:51.650 --> 20:54.763
to the military's
contracting out operations.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.931
The lieutenant was point man
on a paper recommending

20:56.955 --> 21:00.502
- that we cease and desist with such arrangements.
- Agent McGee.

21:00.526 --> 21:02.303
I'll send you the report
by courier.

21:02.327 --> 21:03.605
I appreciate it.

21:03.629 --> 21:04.606
Now,

21:04.630 --> 21:05.640
what can you tell me

21:05.664 --> 21:07.809
about Lieutenant Hutton's death?

21:07.833 --> 21:09.198
Boss, we got to go.

21:10.235 --> 21:12.135
Got to go, Captain.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.687
Dana Hutton was doing a story

21:19.711 --> 21:21.356
on private military companies.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.991
Add it to the list
of coincidences.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.192
Gibbs, Gibbs.

21:24.216 --> 21:26.094
Lieutenant Hutton was murdered.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.095
How?

21:27.119 --> 21:29.164
Look.

21:29.188 --> 21:30.365
We found it.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.434
Well, Mr. Palmer

21:32.458 --> 21:33.668
found it, actually...

21:33.692 --> 21:36.004
embedded in the
lieutenant's shoulder.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.806
What is it?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.007
It's a spherical

21:39.031 --> 21:40.775
metal pellet.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.511
It is 1.5 millimeters
in diameter.

21:43.535 --> 21:46.648
It's composed of 90% platinum
and 10% iridium.

21:46.672 --> 21:48.183
There were two holes
drilled in it

21:48.207 --> 21:49.884
that created an X-shaped cavity,

21:49.908 --> 21:52.308
and guess what I found
in the cavity.

21:53.612 --> 21:55.623
He hates it
when I ask him to guess.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.659
Traces of ricin.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.694
One of the deadliest toxins
known to man.

21:59.718 --> 22:03.364
Yes, your 21st century
naval lieutenant

22:03.388 --> 22:04.799
was killed by an old,

22:04.823 --> 22:08.452
Cold War-era KGB weapon.

22:21.372 --> 22:24.351
KGB?

22:24.375 --> 22:26.420
It's been SVR since '91.

22:26.444 --> 22:27.855
Well, someone out there is using

22:27.879 --> 22:29.423
one of their old tricks.

22:29.447 --> 22:30.624
That's what made me think

22:30.648 --> 22:33.627
of the infamous
Umbrella Murder of 1978.

22:33.651 --> 22:35.963
Russian dissident
assassinated in England.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.965
Gregor Markov.

22:37.989 --> 22:40.601
Now, while he was standing
at a London bus stop,

22:40.625 --> 22:44.438
a passerby carrying
a folded umbrella

22:44.462 --> 22:45.673
bumped into him.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.375
He didn't think much about it

22:48.399 --> 22:49.844
until he began to feel ill

22:49.868 --> 22:51.178
about a day later.

22:51.202 --> 22:53.280
In fact, he had been injected

22:53.304 --> 22:55.116
with a ricin pellet.

22:55.140 --> 22:57.384
The delivery mechanism was felt

22:57.408 --> 23:00.387
to be the spring-loaded tip
of the umbrella.

23:00.411 --> 23:02.623
How long does it take
ricin to kill, Duck?

23:02.647 --> 23:03.657
Three, four days.

23:03.681 --> 23:05.860
Lieutenant Hutton, like Markov,

23:05.884 --> 23:06.961
wouldn't have known
what happened,

23:06.985 --> 23:08.129
and ironically,

23:08.153 --> 23:09.530
if he had made it
to the hospital,

23:09.554 --> 23:10.754
they couldn't have helped him.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.235
There is no antidote.

23:14.259 --> 23:16.625
Thank you, Dr. Mallard.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.678
Yesterday morning this was
a simple car accident.

23:24.702 --> 23:27.694
Now we're talking
KGB assassination.

23:29.707 --> 23:31.685
You been able to connect
the lieutenant's murder

23:31.709 --> 23:33.687
with the disappearance
of his sister?

23:33.711 --> 23:34.822
Maybe.

23:34.846 --> 23:37.391
She was preparing
a negative piece

23:37.415 --> 23:38.826
on private military companies.

23:38.850 --> 23:41.028
Her brother was presenting

23:41.052 --> 23:42.763
a paper to the Joint Chiefs

23:42.787 --> 23:45.633
recommending the government
cut off contracts with them.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.648
I'll make some calls.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.610
It's 1:00 in the morning.

23:56.634 --> 23:58.612
What are you doing down here?

23:58.636 --> 24:00.748
That's none of your business.

24:00.772 --> 24:03.450
I thought you were going to
start locking your front door.

24:03.474 --> 24:05.519
Well, if I did that,
I'd have no social life.

24:05.543 --> 24:07.922
What are you doing here,
M. Allison Hart?

24:07.946 --> 24:10.558
You didn't seem happy
with my new status at NCIS.

24:10.582 --> 24:13.915
Oh, and I thought
I covered that so well.

24:17.822 --> 24:21.690
Are we going to have a problem?

24:22.727 --> 24:24.972
It came from the top.

24:24.996 --> 24:26.307
I take orders.

24:26.331 --> 24:28.309
Since when?

24:28.333 --> 24:29.543
You know what?

24:29.567 --> 24:30.878
I need to finish this.

24:30.902 --> 24:33.894
You never know when I may need
to saw a lady in half.

24:35.907 --> 24:38.375
I heard you were looking
for Dana Hutton.

24:40.411 --> 24:42.122
Is that why you're here?

24:42.146 --> 24:43.157
No.

24:43.181 --> 24:44.558
Oh, come on.

24:44.582 --> 24:47.828
You knew she was investigating
private military contracts

24:47.852 --> 24:49.997
like the one owned by your
biggest client, Colonel Bell.

24:50.021 --> 24:53.234
Oh, don't go there, Mr. Gibbs.

24:53.258 --> 24:55.603
He's the one who pays
for your $500 shoes.

24:55.627 --> 24:56.804
I take offense.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.807
They cost $1,200.

24:59.831 --> 25:01.342
And I asked because

25:01.366 --> 25:03.231
Dana is a friend.

25:04.202 --> 25:06.580
How close?

25:06.604 --> 25:08.282
Close.

25:08.306 --> 25:10.818
When is the last time
you saw her?

25:10.842 --> 25:12.152
A week ago.

25:12.176 --> 25:13.654
She wanted to talk.

25:13.678 --> 25:17.170
She had just broken up
with her producer boyfriend.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.662
And if you want
any more out of me,

25:21.686 --> 25:24.655
you're going to have
to ply me with liquor.

25:27.492 --> 25:29.169
Going to air, ten minutes.

25:29.193 --> 25:31.205
Going to air in ten minutes.

25:31.229 --> 25:32.940
You find Dana?

25:32.964 --> 25:34.441
No. I came to see you.

25:34.465 --> 25:36.443
Why?

25:36.467 --> 25:39.446
Because there are consequences
for misleading federal agents.

25:39.470 --> 25:41.448
What are you talking about?

25:41.472 --> 25:43.951
Why didn't you tell me
you were involved with Dana?

25:43.975 --> 25:45.786
Really didn't think
it was relevant.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.054
Or any of your business.

25:47.078 --> 25:49.657
I'll determine what's relevant.

25:49.681 --> 25:51.692
How serious is it?

25:51.716 --> 25:53.694
Aside from work,

25:53.718 --> 25:55.663
nothing's ever
that serious with Dana.

25:55.687 --> 25:57.698
No one seems to get it.

25:57.722 --> 26:01.001
She's not this perfect angel
that everyone sees on TV.

26:01.025 --> 26:02.036
She's a pro.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.871
She knows how to work it

26:03.895 --> 26:05.739
and she uses people
like the best of 'em.

26:05.763 --> 26:07.641
- She use you?
- Yeah.

26:07.665 --> 26:09.310
I let her.

26:09.334 --> 26:10.678
And enjoyed it.

26:10.702 --> 26:13.747
You know, she has even
more talent offscreen...

26:13.771 --> 26:15.762
What the hell's the matter
with you?

26:23.815 --> 26:25.806
Who else called?

26:30.722 --> 26:32.533
I won't take up any more
of your time, Abby.

26:32.557 --> 26:33.567
But I just want to say that

26:33.591 --> 26:35.369
if you come to Mexico,

26:35.393 --> 26:37.171
I will be your personal host.

26:37.195 --> 26:40.174
You shall see my country
as few people get to see it.

26:40.198 --> 26:41.375
I can't wait.

26:41.399 --> 26:43.697
Well... until then.

26:46.170 --> 26:49.833
- Morning.
- Morning.

26:52.410 --> 26:55.902
Abbs, what was that all about?

26:57.181 --> 26:59.159
Alejandro has invited me
to Mexico

26:59.183 --> 27:01.174
to speak at a symposium.

27:02.253 --> 27:03.430
Don't you love that word?

27:03.454 --> 27:06.033
- Alejandro?
- Symposium.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.401
You're not going to go, are you?

27:07.425 --> 27:08.969
Are you kidding me?
Why wouldn't I go?

27:08.993 --> 27:11.705
Well, I bet he just wants to
find out how many tats you have.

27:11.729 --> 27:14.441
Maybe I have a new one
that you're never going to see.

27:14.465 --> 27:16.210
Why'd you call me down here?

27:16.234 --> 27:18.212
I cracked the encryption

27:18.236 --> 27:20.227
on Lieutenant Hutton's
hard drive.

27:23.908 --> 27:25.919
What am I looking at?

27:25.943 --> 27:28.756
Well, he was using
his top secret clearance

27:28.780 --> 27:31.792
to access old FBI
and CIA transcripts.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.061
That is a debriefing

27:34.085 --> 27:36.797
of a KGB defector in 1985.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.298
The Year of the Spy.

27:38.322 --> 27:40.768
Spies have their own year?

27:40.792 --> 27:43.003
More spies were arrested
on U.S. soil in 1985

27:43.027 --> 27:44.671
than any other year in history.

27:44.695 --> 27:47.331
That's why the media dubbed it
Year of the Spy.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.812
You think the lieutenant
was accessing intel

27:51.836 --> 27:53.347
as part of his work with NIOC?

27:53.371 --> 27:55.749
His C.O. never mentioned it.

27:55.773 --> 27:59.607
So he's... doing it on his own?

28:00.645 --> 28:02.823
Virginia State Police

28:02.847 --> 28:04.558
sent this file
along with the autopsy report.

28:04.582 --> 28:07.027
Mr. Bascom's death
was definitely an accident.

28:07.051 --> 28:10.197
A car driving from the opposite
direction blew a tire,

28:10.221 --> 28:13.434
crossed the center divider,
and it hit him head-on.

28:13.458 --> 28:14.868
He was pronounced dead
at the scene.

28:14.892 --> 28:16.670
What did you find?

28:16.694 --> 28:19.094
Well...

28:21.132 --> 28:23.744
Charley Bascom
was a naturalized citizen.

28:23.768 --> 28:24.945
He immigrated

28:24.969 --> 28:27.281
to the United States
from Canada, 1963.

28:27.305 --> 28:28.482
His birth certificate

28:28.506 --> 28:30.818
indicates that he was born
in Hamilton,

28:30.842 --> 28:32.186
just outside of Toronto.

28:32.210 --> 28:35.389
But he died at the age of three.

28:35.413 --> 28:37.108
Meningitis.

28:38.149 --> 28:40.461
Bogus papers.

28:40.485 --> 28:43.352
Get the autopsy report
down to Ducky.

28:46.390 --> 28:49.203
Gibbs... you talk to Tony?

28:49.227 --> 28:52.072
Late last night.

28:52.096 --> 28:55.122
He went to ZNN this morning.

28:58.169 --> 29:00.180
What?

29:00.204 --> 29:03.367
Tony got physical
with Dana's producer.

29:07.778 --> 29:11.578
I think he may be obsessed
with this woman.

29:37.808 --> 29:39.786
Hi, this is Dana's cell.

29:39.810 --> 29:41.588
Please leave me a message.

29:41.612 --> 29:44.625
Dana, this is
Special Agent DiNozzo.

29:44.649 --> 29:46.393
Tony DiNozzo.

29:46.417 --> 29:47.761
I'm with NCIS.

29:47.785 --> 29:50.430
We've been looking for you
for the past two days.

29:50.454 --> 29:54.117
Um... we can help you.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.038
Please trust me.

29:58.062 --> 30:00.040
I know this is going
to sound crazy,

30:00.064 --> 30:03.056
but I feel like I know you.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.127
You can call me at this number.

30:22.353 --> 30:23.945
Dana?

30:25.156 --> 30:28.335
I'm surprised
you did not call me Laura.

30:28.359 --> 30:31.338
Cop falls for missing woman.

30:31.362 --> 30:33.273
1944.

30:33.297 --> 30:34.841
Gene Tierney.

30:34.865 --> 30:36.510
Dana Andrews.

30:36.534 --> 30:38.278
You making a film reference.

30:38.302 --> 30:39.479
Go figure.

30:39.503 --> 30:41.915
Tony, this is
a murder investigation, okay.

30:41.939 --> 30:43.750
This is not a movie.

30:43.774 --> 30:46.620
Dana Hutton is missing and
may be dead like her brother.

30:46.644 --> 30:48.155
She's not just going to walk in
through that door

30:48.179 --> 30:49.339
and into your life.

30:55.486 --> 30:58.131
What do you got, Duck?

30:58.155 --> 31:01.301
My esteemed colleague
in Stafford County, Virginia,

31:01.325 --> 31:04.838
did a thorough
and well-documented

31:04.862 --> 31:06.873
postmortem of Mr. Bascom.

31:06.897 --> 31:08.909
Since the cause of death

31:08.933 --> 31:11.111
was massive blunt trauma
to the skull,

31:11.135 --> 31:14.114
there were detailed photographs
of his head.

31:14.138 --> 31:17.551
I had this one enlarged.

31:17.575 --> 31:20.487
Notice anything unusual?

31:20.511 --> 31:22.356
Looks pink.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.725
Yeah, it's a condition
called pink tooth.

31:24.749 --> 31:27.394
It's caused by the use
of an arsenic compound

31:27.418 --> 31:30.564
in the mortification
of dental pulp

31:30.588 --> 31:32.833
prior to endodontic obturation.

31:32.857 --> 31:34.868
Ah, geez, Duck, come on.
English.

31:34.892 --> 31:38.705
Well, suffice to say,
it's a therapy unique to Russia

31:38.729 --> 31:40.340
during the mid-20th century.

31:40.364 --> 31:44.144
Mr. Bascom may have
emigrated from Canada,

31:44.168 --> 31:48.015
but I'll stake my reputation
he was born...

31:48.039 --> 31:50.166
in the Soviet Union.

32:00.083 --> 32:02.728
I've consulted with senior
and retired agents

32:02.752 --> 32:06.299
and analysts who specialize
in counterintelligence.

32:06.323 --> 32:08.468
During the height of
the Cold War, there was a legend

32:08.492 --> 32:10.636
of Yuri,
a mole in the Washington area

32:10.660 --> 32:13.139
who operated as the banker,

32:13.163 --> 32:16.275
funding covert KGB ops
in America.

32:16.299 --> 32:18.377
Now, some doubted his existence,

32:18.401 --> 32:20.913
but most believed he was real;
They worked up a profile.

32:20.937 --> 32:24.150
Charles Bascom fits
that profile to a tee.

32:24.174 --> 32:26.619
Used bookstore would be
a perfect front.

32:26.643 --> 32:28.554
It's believed that he kept
over 10 million U.S. dollars

32:28.578 --> 32:29.722
in a slush fund.

32:29.746 --> 32:31.224
FBI is thinking

32:31.248 --> 32:32.658
that once the Berlin Wall
was torn down,

32:32.682 --> 32:34.327
KGB was disbanded,

32:34.351 --> 32:37.296
old Charley Bascom and his money
were forgotten about

32:37.320 --> 32:39.065
in the ensuing chaos.

32:39.089 --> 32:40.366
If Charley was Yuri,

32:40.390 --> 32:42.602
then he was a spy.

32:42.626 --> 32:46.439
Kind of like Kevin Costner's
landlord in the film No Way Out.

32:46.463 --> 32:48.374
What does that make him,

32:48.398 --> 32:49.966
Dana Hutton
and her brother's handler?

32:52.135 --> 32:54.247
Are you suggesting
Dana is a spy?

32:54.271 --> 32:56.415
Look, I'm just saying,

32:56.439 --> 32:58.017
if I was currently
writing a novel,

32:58.041 --> 33:00.153
I could not come up with
a better cast of characters.

33:00.177 --> 33:02.855
We've got Lieutenant Hutton.

33:02.879 --> 33:05.491
- He's a navy officer with top secret clearance.
- Come on.

33:05.515 --> 33:07.793
Tony, she's on
a first-name basis

33:07.817 --> 33:09.495
with the President
of the United States.

33:09.519 --> 33:11.497
You two are both way off base.

33:11.521 --> 33:12.832
If Chuck Bascom was Yuri,

33:12.856 --> 33:14.066
then what happened to the money

33:14.090 --> 33:15.334
after he died in the accident?

33:15.358 --> 33:16.736
Leon,

33:16.760 --> 33:18.437
maybe that's what
this is all about.

33:18.461 --> 33:20.139
Come on.

33:20.163 --> 33:22.859
We're going to the bookstore.
Let's go.

33:27.871 --> 33:30.449
Thanks for coming so quickly.

33:30.473 --> 33:32.464
No problem.

33:34.110 --> 33:36.455
Any word from Dana?

33:36.479 --> 33:37.790
No, ma'am.

33:37.814 --> 33:39.805
We'll let you know
when we're through.

33:43.587 --> 33:44.864
McGee, check out these vents.

33:44.888 --> 33:45.889
Use the snorkel.

33:48.291 --> 33:50.169
Uh, excuse me for a second.

33:50.193 --> 33:51.337
Hello.

33:51.361 --> 33:53.454
Ziva, check behind the books.

33:55.498 --> 33:58.411
There have to be
thousands of them.

33:58.435 --> 34:01.647
Nothing in the vents.

34:01.671 --> 34:03.115
Where's Tony?

34:03.139 --> 34:05.718
Have not seen him
since he got the phone call.

34:05.742 --> 34:09.268
Huh. Bet he's probably talking
to his girl Brenda Bittner.

34:33.670 --> 34:36.181
Boss, what is that?

34:36.206 --> 34:39.284
Well, it's something I haven't
seen in a lot of years.

34:39.309 --> 34:40.853
Microfiche.

34:40.877 --> 34:43.022
It's kind of a

34:43.045 --> 34:44.724
1970s version of one
of those memory plug things,

34:44.748 --> 34:46.792
you know, you put
in the side of the computer.

34:46.815 --> 34:49.395
Oh, uh... flash drive.

34:49.418 --> 34:52.353
Yeah. Yeah, one of those.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.012
Agent DiNozzo?

35:06.036 --> 35:08.581
That's me.

35:08.605 --> 35:11.233
Wasn't sure you'd show.

35:14.411 --> 35:17.256
You were, um, very convincing
on the phone.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.426
So, um, you said
you could help me?

35:20.450 --> 35:23.248
Yeah. Where have you been?

35:25.088 --> 35:27.079
Hiding.

35:29.826 --> 35:34.263
I got a panicked phone call
from my brother.

35:36.032 --> 35:38.678
He told me not to talk
to anyone.

35:38.702 --> 35:41.364
He was on his way
to the hospital...

35:44.307 --> 35:47.186
but wouldn't say why. I...

35:47.210 --> 35:49.201
I heard on the news...

35:51.281 --> 35:53.875
that he had died.

35:54.918 --> 35:56.962
Ricin poisoning.

35:56.986 --> 36:00.433
He was injected
with a microscopic pellet.

36:00.457 --> 36:02.401
Probably didn't even know
it happened.

36:02.425 --> 36:04.970
It's an old technique developed

36:04.994 --> 36:06.962
by the KGB during the Cold War.

36:09.265 --> 36:10.926
You all right?

36:15.405 --> 36:17.383
Couldn't, um...

36:17.407 --> 36:19.952
couldn't-couldn't the doctors
have-have helped him at all?

36:19.976 --> 36:21.821
I mean...

36:21.845 --> 36:23.073
There's no antidote.

36:27.250 --> 36:29.252
So, um...

36:30.587 --> 36:33.089
what else do you know?

36:34.724 --> 36:38.003
Well, your old friend
Charley Bascom

36:38.027 --> 36:40.306
was a deep-cover Soviet agent,

36:40.330 --> 36:43.142
code-named Yuri.

36:43.166 --> 36:47.102
Controlled a slush fund
for the KGB worth millions.

36:50.473 --> 36:53.085
And you already know this.

36:53.109 --> 36:57.256
Charley's will instructed me
to sell the business.

36:57.280 --> 37:00.292
And there's an old safe
in the store,

37:00.316 --> 37:02.307
so I had a locksmith open it.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.598
I was...

37:05.622 --> 37:07.800
shocked at what I found.

37:07.824 --> 37:10.418
There were Russian documents
and codes.

37:12.929 --> 37:14.507
I was baffled.

37:14.531 --> 37:15.941
You know, why...

37:15.965 --> 37:17.956
why Charley would have them.

37:19.469 --> 37:22.248
So I confided in...

37:22.272 --> 37:26.185
the one person I,
uh, trusted the most.

37:26.209 --> 37:28.507
Your brother.

37:32.415 --> 37:35.361
Jeffrey, um,
used his top secret clearance

37:35.385 --> 37:37.496
to try to make sense
of the documents,

37:37.520 --> 37:40.966
and I started researching
the old KGB.

37:40.990 --> 37:44.050
Well, you could have just gone
to the FBI.

37:47.130 --> 37:49.208
Charley was, um...

37:49.232 --> 37:51.877
He was like a father to me.

37:51.901 --> 37:53.913
I didn't want
to expose him as Yuri

37:53.937 --> 37:55.905
until I was absolutely sure.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.238
Was the money in the safe?

38:00.276 --> 38:02.540
No.

38:07.183 --> 38:09.174
But I know where it is.

38:18.261 --> 38:19.572
Nice to meet you, Ms. Hutton.

38:19.596 --> 38:21.440
Tony actually found Dana Hutton.

38:21.464 --> 38:24.695
Well, she is even better-looking
in person, huh?

38:27.537 --> 38:30.165
Money's hiding in plain sight.

38:32.208 --> 38:33.586
Charley converted it
into something

38:33.610 --> 38:35.840
he treasured more
than anything else in the world.

38:42.719 --> 38:44.096
A leather-bound

38:44.120 --> 38:46.499
first edition.

38:46.523 --> 38:49.168
The Collected Works
of William Shakespeare,

38:49.192 --> 38:51.070
Published in 1623.

38:51.094 --> 38:53.639
In today's market at auction

38:53.663 --> 38:56.359
it could fetch $6 million.

39:00.603 --> 39:01.814
And this.

39:01.838 --> 39:02.930
Could you help me?

39:08.578 --> 39:11.891
You can't judge a book
by its cover.

39:11.915 --> 39:14.907
This is the Holy Grail
of book collectors.

39:17.587 --> 39:19.565
The complete first edition

39:19.589 --> 39:20.799
Gutenberg Bible

39:20.823 --> 39:23.502
of 1456.

39:23.526 --> 39:25.504
It's printed on vellum.

39:25.528 --> 39:26.739
Where did he get this?

39:26.763 --> 39:28.107
Well, according to the Internet,

39:28.131 --> 39:31.010
it was stolen by the Nazis

39:31.034 --> 39:33.412
during World War II
and sold on the black market

39:33.436 --> 39:36.448
in the early 1990s
for $2.5 million.

39:36.472 --> 39:39.318
It's worth ten times that now.

39:39.342 --> 39:42.254
Many of the books in this case
are of significant value.

39:42.278 --> 39:43.822
Hell of a story.

39:43.846 --> 39:46.258
Too bad it doesn't have
a happy ending.

39:46.282 --> 39:47.442
Jeffrey's dead.

39:49.218 --> 39:50.296
Who killed your brother?

39:50.320 --> 39:52.185
I don't know.

39:54.023 --> 39:57.703
Probably...
probably the same person...

39:57.727 --> 39:59.592
that killed me.

40:05.668 --> 40:07.913
I had to... I had to find out

40:07.937 --> 40:10.215
what happened to Charley,
you know.

40:10.239 --> 40:13.436
Sometimes when I get
into a story...

40:16.312 --> 40:19.110
I don't know when to stop.

40:23.953 --> 40:25.898
You made us look good
with the FBI.

40:25.922 --> 40:29.134
Fornell says he owes you dinner.

40:29.158 --> 40:32.838
Microfiche was Yuri's
accounting ledger.

40:32.862 --> 40:36.175
Recorded dates, names,
and the amounts of every penny

40:36.199 --> 40:38.711
he dispersed for the KGB.

40:38.735 --> 40:40.579
From the day the bookshop
opened for business

40:40.603 --> 40:42.881
till the last payment in 1991.

40:42.905 --> 40:44.483
Most of them are dead,

40:44.507 --> 40:47.553
in prison, or they
were called back to Russia.

40:47.577 --> 40:50.222
All of them would have known
about the money.

40:50.246 --> 40:52.424
Maybe one of them is the killer.

40:52.448 --> 40:54.593
The Bureau is picking up
the remaining few.

40:54.617 --> 40:56.895
Yeah?

40:56.919 --> 40:59.888
Well, there's one name on there
I'm gonna pick up.

41:07.363 --> 41:09.875
You need to get in again, huh?

41:09.899 --> 41:11.410
No.

41:11.434 --> 41:14.179
Actually, we found everything
we were looking for.

41:14.203 --> 41:16.715
Dana Hutton, the money,
Yuri's files.

41:16.739 --> 41:18.217
When Charley Bascom died,

41:18.241 --> 41:20.285
you could have just
gone on living your life.

41:20.309 --> 41:22.421
But you're greedy.

41:22.445 --> 41:25.524
And you just had to have
that old KGB money.

41:25.548 --> 41:28.818
And you'd kill anybody
that got in your way.

41:33.089 --> 41:35.956
Lieutenant Jeffrey Hutton.

41:58.514 --> 42:00.392
How'd it go?

42:00.416 --> 42:02.043
Well...

42:04.987 --> 42:07.319
She went peacefully.

42:10.359 --> 42:12.088
You okay?

42:14.630 --> 42:16.962
Not really.

42:23.272 --> 42:25.517
I broke rule #10

42:25.541 --> 42:27.441
again.

42:30.546 --> 42:33.572
Never get personally
involved on a case.

42:36.953 --> 42:38.443
Yeah.

42:40.757 --> 42:43.851
That's the rule I've always
had the most trouble with.
