WEBVTT

00:03.568 --> 00:05.222
People have a year
to give you a wedding present.

00:05.309 --> 00:06.876
Shouldn't we get
a year to thank 'em?

00:06.963 --> 00:08.530
That sounds suspiciously
like your theory

00:08.617 --> 00:10.836
for not taking down
the Christmas lights.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.665
Hey, in the summer months,
I may look

00:13.752 --> 00:15.754
like a lazy load,
but the day after Thanksgiving

00:15.841 --> 00:18.409
I'm the neighborhood go-getter.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.629
What's cute is that
you actually believe that.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.197
Ah!

00:23.284 --> 00:25.373
What? Another one? Come on.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.765
I told you
we have a limited amount

00:26.852 --> 00:28.115
of classy thank-you cards.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.159
Then we're down to kittens

00:29.246 --> 00:30.856
in a basket saying, "Thank mew""

00:32.423 --> 00:33.772
I spelled "Beautiful" wrong.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.209
You don't want me
to look like an idiot, do you?

00:35.296 --> 00:36.819
I gave up that fight
when you started

00:36.906 --> 00:38.647
wearing tube socks and sandals.

00:40.301 --> 00:42.433
I'm not gonna apologize
for being comfortable.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.611
And "Beautiful" is the least
of your problems here.

00:46.698 --> 00:49.266
Fondue is not spelled
with three O's.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.182
It's a stupid gift anyway.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.531
Always dropping
the little forks

00:53.618 --> 00:54.576
then you got to stick your hand

00:54.663 --> 00:55.794
in the hot cheese.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.535
No, you don't have to.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.015
You choose to.

01:01.322 --> 01:02.801
Well, maybe I'd do better
if I had one of those

01:02.888 --> 01:04.368
little desks like you got.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.022
Well, when we used our
Brookstone gift card

01:06.109 --> 01:07.415
you should've gotten one
instead of your

01:07.502 --> 01:09.417
battery-operated back scratcher.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.202
Hey, that was a smart purchase.

01:12.289 --> 01:14.117
Besides, that baby
is way more efficient

01:14.204 --> 01:15.379
than the manual kind.

01:15.466 --> 01:16.728
What are you talking
about, the spatula

01:16.815 --> 01:18.556
or the big tree in the backyard?

01:18.643 --> 01:20.210
[chuckles]

01:20.297 --> 01:22.212
[Joyce and Vince moaning]

01:23.996 --> 01:25.955
Must be ten o'clock.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.609
Mom and Vince's
Blue Pill Express

01:27.696 --> 01:29.089
is pulling into the station.

01:30.481 --> 01:31.830
Ah, it used to bother me

01:31.917 --> 01:33.441
but now I can't
fall asleep without it.

01:33.528 --> 01:34.529
It's like ocean sounds.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.577
It's like two old
boats banging hulls.

01:39.664 --> 01:41.536
[laughs]
It's not..

01:41.623 --> 01:44.452
[Vince]
'Oh, God! Oh, my God!'

01:44.539 --> 01:45.757
It shouldn't last
too much longer.

01:45.844 --> 01:46.976
He ate, like, three big plates

01:47.063 --> 01:48.020
of spaghetti.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.286
Hurry!
I think I broke Vince.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.332
Great. Now we can't return him.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.858
[groans]

02:01.730 --> 02:03.384
What, are you developing film?

02:04.472 --> 02:06.430
Oh, what happened?

02:06.517 --> 02:08.171
I threw my back out.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.999
That's what you get
for doing it on the floor.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.044
We weren't doing it
on the floor.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.090
We're not animals.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.614
Yeah, we were doing it
reverse prairie dog style

02:16.701 --> 02:18.312
and I slipped on a strawberry.

02:20.096 --> 02:22.968
That's what happened
to the strawberries.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.883
Well, we should take him
to the emergency room.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.058
No, no doctors.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.103
I just need bed rest

02:27.190 --> 02:28.757
and some Korean mamasan

02:28.844 --> 02:31.325
to make jumpy-jumpy on my spine.

02:31.412 --> 02:32.891
Well, lift him up and get him
onto the bed.

02:32.978 --> 02:35.024
Wait, wait, wait.
He's covered in coconut oil.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.461
I wondered why I was craving
a Mounds bar.

02:39.681 --> 02:41.073
Just-just grab a couple tufts

02:41.161 --> 02:42.814
of back hair
and use it as a handle.

02:44.468 --> 02:46.470
There's still an hour
left on the Viagra

02:46.557 --> 02:49.125
so for God's sake, don't
roll me over on my stomach.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.567
♪ For the first time ♪

02:56.654 --> 03:00.005
♪ In my life ♪

03:00.092 --> 03:03.008
♪ I see love ♪♪

03:16.892 --> 03:18.981
- Oh, hey, mom.
- Oh, morning.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.635
Where are you going?

03:20.722 --> 03:22.289
Yoga class.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.552
These ankles don't
put themselves behind my head.

03:26.945 --> 03:28.643
- What about Vince?
- What about him?

03:28.730 --> 03:30.732
- Is he gonna be okay?
- He's fine.

03:30.819 --> 03:34.214
I gave him one of my Percocets,
he's sleeping like a baby.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.345
At least I think
it was a Percocet.

03:35.432 --> 03:38.305
Maybe it was an estrogen pill.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.350
Well, if his boobs get
any bigger, we'll know, right?

03:42.874 --> 03:44.789
Mom?

03:44.876 --> 03:46.878
Mom?

03:46.965 --> 03:49.490
- 'Careful. Watch my head.'
- 'Shut up and quit squirming.'

03:49.577 --> 03:51.056
[Mike]
'You're lucky I found you.'

03:51.143 --> 03:53.276
Did you wash your hands
after you got off the dumper?

03:53.363 --> 03:55.235
'Cause I don't
wanna get pinkeye.

03:57.454 --> 03:59.064
What's going on?

03:59.151 --> 04:01.980
I found him curled up on
the floor outside the bathroom.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.547
Waited out there for 20 minutes

04:03.634 --> 04:07.029
while Sir Craps-A-Lot
sat on his throne.

04:07.116 --> 04:10.511
The doctor told me not to push.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.295
Did he tell you to stuff
your musket

04:12.382 --> 04:14.341
with the occasional bran muffin?

04:15.864 --> 04:18.345
Hey, I have increased
my fiber significantly.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.390
It takes a couple days
to get the troops moving.

04:20.477 --> 04:23.567
- Okay, boys, enough shop talk.
- I'm sorry.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.526
Sometimes he really
gets under my skin.

04:25.613 --> 04:28.050
Like there's any room
under there.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.748
You, shut up
and you, don't engage him.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.489
Could you at least
turn me the other way?

04:32.576 --> 04:34.230
- What's the difference?
- I'm Italian.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.972
We like to face the door.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.756
My hunch is
the bullet that gets you

04:38.843 --> 04:40.889
is coming from inside the house.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.023
Just relax. Mom will be home
in a couple of hours.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.330
I'm starving. Could one
of you make me some oatmeal?

04:47.417 --> 04:49.376
Maybe a nice Denver omelet?

04:49.463 --> 04:51.682
Don't look at me.
I'm late for work.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.293
This whole "Not pushing"
thing has really

04:53.380 --> 04:54.642
thrown off my schedule.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.470
- Mike.
- Sorry.

04:58.907 --> 04:59.995
Oatmeal, no omelet.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.127
- Just the oatmeal.
- Okay.

05:02.214 --> 05:05.261
But I don't like my oats
too dry or too soupy.

05:05.348 --> 05:08.699
I like 'em just right.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.310
I'm the baby bear.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.144
That's me eating lunch

05:19.231 --> 05:22.017
right outside
the Louvre in Paris.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.323
Is that where they
got the Mona Lisa?

05:23.410 --> 05:25.194
I don't know, I didn't go in.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.153
But while I was waiting
for Molly

05:28.240 --> 05:29.938
I had the best crepe of my life.

05:30.025 --> 05:32.593
And I have had
my share of crepes.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.464
You've had everybody's
share of crepes.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.512
Now, did you grow a mustache
while you were there?

05:38.599 --> 05:39.948
Some of it's mustache.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.602
- Most of it's Nutella.
- Mm.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.562
What's that you're eating
under the Eiffel Tower?

05:45.649 --> 05:47.477
A fresh baguette
with salami and cheese.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.827
Don't let the simplicity
fool you.

05:49.914 --> 05:50.828
It was a game-changer.

05:52.787 --> 05:53.962
Is that all you did,
was walk around

05:54.049 --> 05:55.659
eating crepes and sandwiches?

05:55.746 --> 05:57.574
Of course not. It was Paris.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.489
Ignoring the croissants
would be criminal.

06:01.970 --> 06:05.060
They had this one, it was filled
with either peach or apricot..

06:05.147 --> 06:07.628
I got a picture somewhere.

06:07.715 --> 06:10.108
Man, I-I don't need photographic
proof that you eat.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.154
Your burps paint
a picture all day long.

06:14.025 --> 06:15.505
You know, I really didn't
gain much weight, though.

06:15.592 --> 06:18.508
'Cause Paris is a walking city.

06:18.595 --> 06:21.729
Yeah, you just stroll the
cobblestone streets for hours.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.470
Must've been quite a sight,
with all those food carts

06:23.557 --> 06:25.036
and stray dogs
following you around.

06:27.952 --> 06:29.519
Ah, Gay Paree.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.260
Beautiful "City of Lights."

06:31.347 --> 06:33.001
I can still hear it
calling my name.

06:33.088 --> 06:35.569
And it's probably saying,
"Mike, your order is ready."

06:38.833 --> 06:41.575
What is, what is that you are
eating outside of Notre Dame?

06:41.662 --> 06:43.620
- It looks like a pig's head.
- It is a pig's head.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.317
- Nothing goes to waste there.
- Oh.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.233
Yeah, not with you in town.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.062
Oh, before I forget

06:51.149 --> 06:53.282
thank you.

06:53.369 --> 06:55.850
- And thank you.
- What is this?

06:55.937 --> 06:57.373
Thank-you cards
for your thoughtful

06:57.460 --> 06:58.940
and useful wedding gifts.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.508
Oh, no, you don't!
I want this mailed to me.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.163
Don't be ridiculous,
just take it.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.339
Hey, I-I sweated over finding
you the perfect gift

07:07.427 --> 07:09.472
and I expect to find a proper
thank-you in the mailbox.

07:11.343 --> 07:12.867
Come on, you're gonna make me
go through all that?

07:12.954 --> 07:15.609
You poor man, first you have
to unwrap all of those gifts

07:15.696 --> 07:17.262
and now
you have to lick a stamp.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.615
Just pretend it's gelato.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.619
Oh, I didn't even show you
the gelato pictures.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.579
Now, the setting
is the Arc de Triomphe

07:29.666 --> 07:31.712
the flavor is Cafe De Leche.

07:41.896 --> 07:44.072
[Vince]
'Hello?
Did someone come home?'

07:44.159 --> 07:45.465
'I'm in the downstairs can'

07:45.552 --> 07:46.944
'and I'm in a bit of a pickle.'

07:51.340 --> 07:53.037
'Come on!
I heard keys jingling.'

07:53.124 --> 07:54.343
'I know it's you, Molly.'

07:54.430 --> 07:56.693
'I smell butter rum
Life Savers.'

07:59.130 --> 08:00.349
Damn it.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.482
- Where's mom?
- 'She went AWOL.'

08:02.569 --> 08:04.484
'You're all I got, butter rum.'

08:06.137 --> 08:08.139
What do you need?
Toilet paper or magazine?

08:08.226 --> 08:10.315
If it's toilet paper,
use a magazine.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.668
'Please, just help me.'

08:16.365 --> 08:18.280
Alright. Here I come.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.282
- Are you decent?
- 'Yes. Hurry.'

08:22.850 --> 08:23.938
This better not..

08:24.025 --> 08:26.157
[screams]
'No!'

08:26.244 --> 08:28.116
You are naked!
You lied to me!

08:28.203 --> 08:29.900
I had to.
I'm in survival mode.

08:29.987 --> 08:32.250
Help me out of this tub.
The water's ice cold.

08:32.337 --> 08:35.340
Which explains why Mr. Turtle
is in his shell.

08:35.427 --> 08:36.907
Shut up! Don't speak!

08:36.994 --> 08:39.214
For God's sakes, cover yourself!

08:39.301 --> 08:42.043
Okay, the keys
are under the mat.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.310
Marco.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.790
I know where you are.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.574
Let's just get this over with.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.445
Just grab my arm
and start pulling.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.926
The minute I hit the floor,
I can walrus my way

08:56.013 --> 08:57.319
back to the couch.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.545
Ew. Why are you so slippery?

09:05.632 --> 09:07.503
I apply conditioner
to my arm hair.

09:07.590 --> 09:08.635
Makes it supple.

09:08.722 --> 09:09.897
Plus, when the wind hits it

09:09.984 --> 09:12.247
it ripples
like a field of wheat.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.642
Alright, we're going on three.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.386
One, two

09:21.473 --> 09:22.474
three. Oh!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.346
Ow! Oh, God!

09:24.433 --> 09:26.087
- My back!
- Oh, God!

09:26.174 --> 09:28.089
- You're killing my back!
- What am I touching?

09:28.176 --> 09:29.917
What am I touching?
Don't tell me!

09:30.004 --> 09:31.527
Don't tell me!

09:31.614 --> 09:32.876
[Vince screaming]

09:32.963 --> 09:34.835
[both screaming]

09:39.927 --> 09:41.232
[Vince grunting]

09:44.235 --> 09:46.107
Be careful! I'm in agony here!

09:46.194 --> 09:49.240
Oh, really? 'Cause I'm having
the time of my life.

09:49.327 --> 09:52.374
This would be a lot easier
if you oiled my fanny.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.289
For the third time, no!

09:54.376 --> 09:56.247
Aah! Watch those turns!

09:57.292 --> 09:59.773
[thud]
'Ow!'

09:59.860 --> 10:03.037
'Slow down!
I'm lapping my scrotum!'

10:03.124 --> 10:06.606
Shut up, or I'll drag you
straight to the street!

10:06.693 --> 10:09.826
Seriously, I'm losing skin
like a pencil eraser!

10:09.913 --> 10:12.176
Just spray a little
Pam in my crack!

10:14.091 --> 10:16.790
And here is where we part ways.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.488
You're gonna abandon me here
in the middle of nowhere?

10:19.575 --> 10:21.098
The couch is right here.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.361
Come on, dumpling,
you can do it.

10:23.448 --> 10:24.928
You're strong like bull.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.498
Yeah, and you're stupid
like jackass. Adios!

10:29.585 --> 10:31.065
You're really gonna
leave me here?

10:31.152 --> 10:33.110
Yeah, that was the plan!

10:33.197 --> 10:36.200
Look, please, help me back up
on the couch, please.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.944
Fine!

10:43.947 --> 10:45.862
Alright, on three.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.864
[Both]
One, two.

10:47.951 --> 10:48.865
Three, go!

10:51.302 --> 10:53.043
Oh, God! Oh, God!

10:53.130 --> 10:56.438
Ugh! Okay, this is twice,
that's shame on you!

11:00.572 --> 11:01.748
[Vince]
'Where's my soup?'

11:01.835 --> 11:03.488
I'm making it!

11:03.575 --> 11:05.055
'What's throwing
you the curveball'

11:05.142 --> 11:07.536
'the can opener
or the knobs on the stove?'

11:10.191 --> 11:11.932
Thank God you're home.
I need your help.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.716
- What's going on?
- Mom's gone missing.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.587
And I've been left
to take care of Vince.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.502
I had to drag his wet,
naked body

11:17.589 --> 11:19.679
out of the tub
and onto the couch.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.506
Ew.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.770
I can still hear
his squeaky butt cheeks..

11:25.423 --> 11:28.557
...just dragging across
the bathroom tiles.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.733
Stop it, Molly,
you're scaring me.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.909
You don't know fear
until you've splashed down

11:32.996 --> 11:35.999
face first, into the briny
depths of Vincent Moranto!

11:38.349 --> 11:39.699
You know what,
I'm gonna go look for ma.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.875
No! No! You get back here!

11:41.962 --> 11:43.137
You coward!

11:43.224 --> 11:44.704
[door slams]

11:46.880 --> 11:48.011
Are you eating my soup?

11:48.098 --> 11:50.622
Yes, I am! Mmm-mmm good!

11:55.410 --> 11:58.065
Oh, good,
somebody called the cops.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.026
How you feeling?
You're back still bothering you?

12:03.113 --> 12:05.072
Yeah and your wife
cannon-balling me

12:05.159 --> 12:06.726
in the bathtub didn't help.

12:08.292 --> 12:09.554
Thank God you're home.

12:09.641 --> 12:11.208
- Are we having soup?
- No.

12:11.295 --> 12:14.124
It's for baby bear,
and you're feeding him, papa.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.952
What?
I just walked in the door.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.562
Hey, you wanna know what I found

12:17.649 --> 12:18.912
when I walked in the door?

12:18.999 --> 12:20.957
That! Naked and wet
in the bathtub!

12:21.044 --> 12:24.178
- Oh!
- Look at it!

12:24.265 --> 12:25.657
Look at it!

12:27.094 --> 12:29.574
Look at it!

12:29.661 --> 12:32.969
For God's sake,
I'm a human being!

12:33.056 --> 12:34.362
We'll take
a hair sample and see

12:34.449 --> 12:36.277
what a biologist
has to say about that.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.321
Just feed him the soup.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.975
I'm gonna go take a shower

12:39.062 --> 12:41.369
since the downstairs bathtub
is now a crime scene!

12:47.592 --> 12:49.159
Feed me slow.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.466
Don't shovel it in
like the way you eat.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.520
Guess mom thinks,
'cause she pays the mortgage

13:02.607 --> 13:04.566
she's got live-in help.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.176
Yeah, but you give her
money every month.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.526
Well, that's technically
for a short-term loan

13:08.613 --> 13:09.658
she gave me six years ago.

13:11.399 --> 13:12.879
What about the money I give you?

13:12.966 --> 13:14.271
Can we please stay on point?

13:14.358 --> 13:16.360
Sure.

13:16.447 --> 13:18.014
[bell ringing]

13:18.101 --> 13:20.756
[Vince]
'Hello?
I can't reach the remote!'

13:20.843 --> 13:22.323
Why'd you give him that bell?

13:22.410 --> 13:24.020
The real question is,
why did your Aunt Trudy

13:24.107 --> 13:25.500
give it to us
as a wedding present?

13:25.587 --> 13:26.544
Aunt Trudy gave us that?

13:26.631 --> 13:28.633
I thanked Cousin Kevin for it.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.375
Why would your meth-head cousin
give us a little porcelain bell?

13:34.074 --> 13:35.597
The real question is,
why would Aunt Trudy

13:35.684 --> 13:37.773
give us Lynyrd Skynyrd do-rags?

13:39.862 --> 13:42.604
Oh, no, I-I think
all of my thank-you cards

13:42.691 --> 13:44.301
might be off by one.

13:44.388 --> 13:46.434
Mike..

13:46.521 --> 13:47.827
[Vince]
'Hello? Hurry!'

13:47.914 --> 13:50.307
'The channel's stuck
on Telemundo!'

13:52.396 --> 13:53.745
It's your turn to go down.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.964
Hey, I fed him, powdered him

13:55.051 --> 13:56.357
and carried him to the toilet.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.664
I'll give you my lap desk..

14:00.927 --> 14:02.842
...and $400.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.498
Is that the $400 I gave you
to give to your mom?

14:07.585 --> 14:08.935
Oh, fine, I'll go.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.547
Keep doing your cards.

14:15.593 --> 14:18.248
"Thank you for the sliver
cundlestucks."

14:21.773 --> 14:23.471
I may not be right-handed.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.476
[woman speaking Spanish on TV]

14:29.477 --> 14:31.000
Damn you, evolution.

14:31.087 --> 14:33.524
Monkey feet
would be perfect right now.

14:36.745 --> 14:39.008
Quit ringing the bell,
Quasimodo.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.664
I was kind of hoping for Mike.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.405
I want him to turn me on my side

14:44.492 --> 14:46.581
'cause I need to break wind.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.235
Do you have
any boundaries at all?

14:49.323 --> 14:50.759
Hey, I said "Break wind."

14:50.846 --> 14:52.543
What-what you want me
to hold out my pinky?

14:52.630 --> 14:54.676
No, thanks.
I've already seen your pinky.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.335
- Joyce.
- Mom.

15:01.422 --> 15:02.814
Mom!

15:02.902 --> 15:04.686
I swear to God,
if you take off again..

15:06.340 --> 15:08.385
Oh, come on.
What are you, Spider-Man?

15:09.299 --> 15:10.257
Over here.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.869
What is going on with you?

15:13.956 --> 15:15.610
I didn't sign up for this.

15:15.697 --> 15:18.265
Vince is supposed
to be my young stud.

15:18.352 --> 15:20.006
He's supposed
to take care of me.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.312
Yeah, he almost paralyzed
himself taking care of you.

15:22.399 --> 15:23.923
Mm. That's how it starts.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.273
First he throws
his back out having sex

15:26.360 --> 15:28.014
then he breaks a hip having sex

15:28.101 --> 15:30.016
then he has a heart attack
having sex.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.279
What kind of sex
are you guys having?

15:32.366 --> 15:34.107
Don't! Oh, God, don't tell me.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.239
You already ruined
strawberries for me.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.027
I'm not gonna watch
another man die.

15:42.854 --> 15:45.292
I went through it
with your father..

15:45.379 --> 15:46.815
...I can't do it again.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.166
Is that what this is about?

15:52.560 --> 15:54.692
Mom, Vince is not dying.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.912
Hm, doesn't mean I won't
try to kill him.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.089
But at this moment he's fine.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.178
[sighs]

16:02.265 --> 16:03.875
I know this sounds crazy..

16:05.747 --> 16:06.748
...but when I saw him
sprawled out

16:06.835 --> 16:09.011
on the floor like that..

16:09.098 --> 16:11.883
...I panicked.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.843
You can't live your life
worrying and-and hiding.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.714
I know, I know.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.890
And mainly, you can't
pawn him off on me

16:18.978 --> 16:20.457
every time you get spooked.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.243
I am so sorry.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.723
You know, I saw things today
that I can't unsee.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.858
Hey, nothing could
be worse than walking in

16:29.945 --> 16:32.513
on your husband buck naked
on the scale

16:32.600 --> 16:35.429
bending over
so he can read the numbers.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.648
Okay, now imagine
the scale's view.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.215
That was my day!

16:39.302 --> 16:40.651
Ooh!

16:40.738 --> 16:42.392
With all of Vince's body hair..

16:42.479 --> 16:43.524
...that's a rough view.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.830
I'm sayin'.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.571
[bell ringing]

16:47.658 --> 16:50.748
[Vince]
'Hello! I need
to go pee again!'

16:50.835 --> 16:52.011
For better or worse, mom.

16:53.447 --> 16:55.188
Alright.

16:55.275 --> 16:56.363
[bell ringing]

16:56.450 --> 16:57.625
Ring that bell one more time

16:57.712 --> 16:58.887
it's going inside you!

16:59.757 --> 17:01.237
Mom's home!

17:08.505 --> 17:10.333
And what is this I finally found
in my mailbox this morning?

17:10.420 --> 17:12.596
Looks like a prompt
and thoughtful thank-you

17:12.683 --> 17:14.990
that arrived via
the US Postal Service.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.819
Well, how very civilized.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.690
- Hmm!
- Why are you smelling it?

17:19.777 --> 17:21.518
Well, sometimes people spray
a little signature scent

17:21.605 --> 17:24.043
on personal correspondence.

17:24.130 --> 17:27.002
We're not lovers, Carl.
Open the damn card.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.743
Let me savor the anticipation.

17:32.486 --> 17:35.837
"Carl, thank you so much
for your thoughtful gift.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.579
Molly and I both love
the wiker placemats."

17:42.191 --> 17:44.672
What are "Wiker" placemats?

17:44.759 --> 17:46.065
It's pronounced "Wicker."

17:46.152 --> 17:48.023
When it's spelled "Wicker."

17:49.590 --> 17:51.548
This says "Wiker."

17:51.635 --> 17:52.680
And I didn't even
give you placemats.

17:52.767 --> 17:55.378
I gave you a fondue pot.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.772
Oh, crap. You must've been
in the first batch.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.295
I hadn't nailed down
my system yet.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.211
I didn't order grapefruit.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.692
And I didn't give
you a "Buttful breed maker""

18:08.043 --> 18:09.436
That's "Beautiful bread maker."

18:09.523 --> 18:11.002
Some of that's my handwriting.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.048
Oh, so you did use your hands.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.310
I was wrong, Carl.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.793
Well, I'll expect a correction
in the mail next week

18:18.880 --> 18:20.621
and a personal invitation
to a fondue party.

18:22.318 --> 18:24.668
But, why, I do like the kittens
in the basket.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.540
"Thank mew."

18:33.416 --> 18:35.288
[theme music]
