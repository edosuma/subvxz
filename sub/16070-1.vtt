WEBVTT

00:27.329 --> 00:31.561
Oh, let's just get in there, baby.
Let's go. Hustle. Here we go.

00:32.935 --> 00:35.768
I love angry sex. This is the best.

00:36.004 --> 00:37.631
Oh, you wanna do it right here, huh?

00:37.873 --> 00:41.866
Oh, yeah... Okay.

00:44.580 --> 00:47.811
Give up, already.
Yeah, you know.

00:57.426 --> 01:00.953
I like this girl. Really do.

01:01.330 --> 01:02.820
Sometimes you just know.

01:09.872 --> 01:12.670
I'm not finished.

01:19.869 --> 01:22.669
Anyway, here's what I'm thinking.
We start with a blowjob.

01:22.677 --> 01:24.611
Yeah. I mean, obviously, you know?

01:24.845 --> 01:26.409
And most girls
find it rewarding the way I do it...

01:26.410 --> 01:30.706
...because I turn what is normally
a chore into, like, a training session.

01:30.707 --> 01:34.104
It's like my own special Head Start
program. Even got Chloraseptic spray.

01:34.644 --> 01:36.710
Do that really well,
we move on to the nasty stuff.

01:37.284 --> 01:39.885
Do some artsy live streaming video.
Totally tasteful.

01:40.420 --> 01:42.081
Don't worry, I'll get you paid. Easy.

01:42.861 --> 01:45.613
- Wait, I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?
- Yeah.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.184
I accept your rebuke of my advances.

01:48.196 --> 01:49.765
But for future reference, could you
at least give me a reason why?

01:49.832 --> 01:51.295
How about 10?

01:52.835 --> 01:54.693
I love angry sex. This is the best.

01:55.971 --> 01:57.571
It's gonna be great. Just...

02:04.847 --> 02:06.802
Hey, we're going Dutch
on gas money, you know.

02:07.734 --> 02:10.300
Shut the fuck up.
I'm not even listen...

02:10.537 --> 02:11.761
Oh, my God! Why aren't you...?

02:12.606 --> 02:13.705
Dick!

02:14.241 --> 02:15.667
- Listen. Sarah?
- Oh, my God.

02:15.692 --> 02:17.692
Stop bitching on me. I didn't know it was your sister.

02:17.791 --> 02:22.619
If I did, it was dark, I was drunk
and I thought it was you.

02:22.928 --> 02:26.291
Oh, she's pregnant too. You tell your sister...

02:26.367 --> 02:29.559
...that I'll make a donation
to Planned Parenthood in her honor.

02:31.372 --> 02:33.540
Sarah, my ex.

02:35.009 --> 02:36.506
Big cunt.

02:45.688 --> 02:46.582
Rachel, I apologize.

02:48.722 --> 02:50.822
Sometimes when you try
a new restaurant, it's a gamble.

02:51.392 --> 02:53.185
And today we lost.

02:55.531 --> 02:58.127
I'm thinking to avoid
any sexual obligation, that's you.

03:08.282 --> 03:08.949
Oh, my God.

03:12.587 --> 03:16.018
Perhaps I can interest you in some of
our fabulous Famine Fiesta Fries?

03:16.557 --> 03:19.283
She could use a little more famine
and a little less fried.

03:21.622 --> 03:24.120
Two Baja Car Bombs on the snap.

03:25.092 --> 03:26.323
Okay, no, I don't drink...

03:26.694 --> 03:28.988
...but thank you.
- I wasn't ordering for you.

03:34.632 --> 03:38.432
- I gotta warn you, the stereo's busted.
- That's okay.

03:38.568 --> 03:40.402
I've got a little bit
of a headache, so...

03:44.307 --> 03:45.634
See?!

03:46.710 --> 03:47.809
It's been like this for a month!

03:49.346 --> 03:50.809
I got it.

03:58.889 --> 04:01.319
These are for your ears!

04:02.692 --> 04:03.586
Thanks.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.796
You look offended by the song!

04:07.330 --> 04:10.158
But if you really listen,
it's not really vulgar.

04:10.700 --> 04:15.303
It's about a guy, he's in love. And
I know he's saying, "Pop the pussy."

04:15.839 --> 04:17.564
But it's a metaphor for, like:

04:18.108 --> 04:20.208
"I wanna hug you!"

04:20.777 --> 04:24.174
<i>Pop that pussy
Hug me, hug me, hug me, hug me</i>

04:25.231 --> 04:27.764
So I'll call you later?

04:28.001 --> 04:30.998
- And I'll call the cops, you asshole.
- I had a nice time tonight.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.709
<i>- Hello.
- Josh, I just went on...</i>

04:38.745 --> 04:40.572
<i>- ... the worst date of my life.
- Rachel.</i>

04:42.081 --> 04:44.875
<i>- Hey, look, I'm gl...
- I'm so, so sorry.</i>

04:45.418 --> 04:48.182
Why are you sorry?
Baby, I was the one who...

04:48.421 --> 04:52.148
<i>- Can we maybe, you know, grab a...?
- Yeah. Yeah, no, that sounds great.</i>

04:52.192 --> 04:54.583
<i>- Yeah.
- I'd really like that.</i>

04:54.961 --> 04:58.722
Listen, I'm out with a friend right now.
But can I call you?

04:58.798 --> 05:00.693
<i>- What about dinner tomorrow night?
- I'd like that.</i>

05:01.234 --> 05:03.031
Yeah, I'd like that too. All right.

05:03.269 --> 05:06.837
I'm so glad you called. All right, bye.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.334
Told you.
I just show them the difference...

05:10.376 --> 05:12.842
...between what's in the hand
and what's in the bush.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.513
You have mastered
the female psyche.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.080
To get them to run,
I make them think that I'm shit.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.650
To get them to come,
I make them think they're shit.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.878
Either way, you're the asshole.

05:23.523 --> 05:25.420
It's what I do.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.690
<i>Sorry.</i>

06:17.143 --> 06:18.540
All right.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.636
Look at you, all white and thin.

06:20.780 --> 06:24.043
I bet if I laid you on this bar,
she could snort you.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.584
Listen, beauty queen.

06:25.718 --> 06:29.117
I know people are concerned about
you because you're dangerously thin.

06:29.255 --> 06:32.119
But I'm not one of those people.
Yet I am concerned.

06:32.258 --> 06:33.882
That you've had too many drinks...

06:34.060 --> 06:37.561
...and your fingers are in this bowl
like it's one of your sorority sisters.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.923
These pretzeled devils,
far from complimentary.

06:40.099 --> 06:41.962
I mean, baby,
get your head in the game.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.931
Nothing tastes as good
as looking good.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.036
- That is just...
- Excuse me.

06:47.707 --> 06:50.708
Are you psycho? I mean,
how can you even begin to talk to...?

06:50.843 --> 06:51.932
Easy, Urlacher.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.170
Ever notice it's the linebackers
concerned with people not eating?

06:55.315 --> 06:58.384
If the pussy police here would
stop ordering her fries tempura...

06:58.518 --> 06:59.550
I just had a child.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.118
Congratulations.
I'm sure he was probably delicious.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.947
Looks like you
downed the whole thing.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.750
You're an asshole.

07:09.228 --> 07:12.786
- You really are an asshole.
- Then walk away.

07:24.877 --> 07:28.174
- Let me just go get my purse, okay?
- Get cigarettes.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.216
- Let's go.
- Okay.

07:31.351 --> 07:35.251
Take me. Take me to your house.
Take me right now to your house.

07:35.388 --> 07:38.457
- Hey, guy.
- Tank, hey. Tank, this is Renee.

07:38.591 --> 07:40.488
- Yeah. Come here.
- Renee, Tank.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.228
- Hey, okay. Two seconds.
- Talk to me for a second.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.794
- Yeah, I'll talk to you all night.
- All right.

07:45.932 --> 07:48.660
Didn't I just save your ass?
I just cleaned up your bed...

07:48.801 --> 07:52.769
...and you're shitting in it again, okay?
Aren't you getting fucking married?

07:53.072 --> 07:55.299
I am getting married...

07:55.808 --> 07:57.876
...but not tonight.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.242
- Renee. Renee, there she is.
- Josh.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.712
There she is. She's all mine.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.052
I have to work tomorrow.

08:12.458 --> 08:15.925
Everybody's gotta work tomorrow.
It's Tuesday.

08:16.062 --> 08:20.861
Good one.
I have a strict no-sleepover policy.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.968
Yeah.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.207
Come on, Tank, it's almost 5.

08:34.881 --> 08:39.145
For some people that's not tonight,
it's tomorrow.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.125
I hate those people.

09:05.311 --> 09:06.708
Shit.

09:06.846 --> 09:11.246
Dustin? Yeah, five minutes is fine.
Okay, bye.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.884
- Dude. What the shit?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:14.020 --> 09:17.783
I told you this was happening. As
of now, I'm training for the marathon.

09:17.924 --> 09:22.017
Goal: Run, don't walk. Nothing wrong
with a little bit of discipline.

09:22.195 --> 09:23.660
By the way, you should try it.

09:23.796 --> 09:26.364
You need discipline
like I need to miss my period.

09:26.532 --> 09:28.224
Seriously, you're already, like...

09:28.367 --> 09:31.732
...a crazy, insane, OCD alpha-dog...

09:31.871 --> 09:33.666
...cyborg crazy creature.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.305
You mean, I have a job?

09:35.441 --> 09:39.136
And now you're gonna wake me up
at 5:15 every single morning...

09:39.278 --> 09:42.313
...so that eventually
you can run 26 miles in a circle.

09:42.448 --> 09:46.314
Here's the great part. You get to
go back to sleep indefinitely. Yea!

09:47.487 --> 09:53.787
For the record, I am involved in
a very taboo interoffice relationship.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.159
- Morning.
- Good morning.

09:58.364 --> 10:02.230
Dustin, the bad boy
from the wrong side of the tracks.

10:02.368 --> 10:03.799
I'm from Lexington.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.833
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.972
- See you.
- Yeah.

10:13.813 --> 10:16.438
That's not the secret knock.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.810
That's the one. What's going on, man?

10:20.953 --> 10:23.681
I need to move this into your room.
Tonight is the night.

10:23.823 --> 10:27.359
And if all goes according to plan,
consider this move permanent.

10:27.527 --> 10:31.063
<i>- "Lawrence of a Labia"?
- Yeah, in a moment of weakness...</i>

10:31.230 --> 10:35.664
...I bought the entire EFI. The
Erotic Film Institute's top 100. Enjoy.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.234
Where did it go wrong?
You have a serious problem.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.462
Better than taking
sexual frustrations out...

10:40.606 --> 10:43.300
...on a parade of one-night skanks
I'll never see again.

10:43.442 --> 10:44.509
- True.
- Good morning.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.907
Hey, no, no, come here. This
is Dusty, my roommate-slash-cousin.

10:48.047 --> 10:51.947
Not technically related. Our parents
were friends until his mom walked out.

10:52.084 --> 10:55.483
Slash-fuckhead for bringing up
bad family shit at inappropriate times.

10:55.621 --> 10:56.688
It's nice to meet you.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.891
- Nice to meet you.
- Fucking family.

10:59.025 --> 11:02.185
What's the plan? Bring this girl
back here, pop open chloroform...

11:02.361 --> 11:04.258
...insert Tab A into Slot B, repeat?

11:04.397 --> 11:07.091
No. Tonight is the night
I tell her how I feel.

11:07.233 --> 11:10.791
Tank, this girl... This girl is my
soul mate and it's time she knew that.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.301
Not if you want to fuck her.

11:13.439 --> 11:16.474
You, what is the nicest thing
I've said to you since I met you?

11:16.609 --> 11:19.075
You complimented me
on my technique.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.677
Okay, look, I'm not you, okay?

11:20.813 --> 11:24.007
I'm not gonna manipulate her,
I'm not gonna con her.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.810
- I'm just gonna be myself.
- No.

11:25.952 --> 11:29.351
Yourself is a repressed headcase that
beats more meat than Rocky Balboa.

11:29.488 --> 11:33.115
By hiding porn, taking her to joints
you hate, training for a marathon...

11:33.292 --> 11:36.657
...you're not showing the real you.
You're showing a highlight-reel you.

11:36.796 --> 11:41.162
- Thus, in fact, you're conning her.
- You don't get it. You don't get it.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.130
I love her. Alexis...

11:44.270 --> 11:46.668
Alexis is my angel.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.806
You get it, right?

11:51.944 --> 11:54.342
We don't get it. We don't.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.638
Anyway, we can skip this
"call me" scenario.

11:56.782 --> 11:57.974
- I'm already late.
- Great.

12:05.916 --> 12:09.076
Dusty, this is absurd.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.345
What? You love steak,
we're eating steak.

12:11.489 --> 12:15.218
- You're a vegan.
- Not tonight. Eat, eat, eat. Enjoy.

12:16.160 --> 12:21.323
I feel a little guilty loving steak
so much and you're a vegan.

12:21.665 --> 12:23.528
But whatever.

12:24.068 --> 12:26.500
I love the way you eat.

12:27.004 --> 12:28.765
I love that you eat.

12:28.939 --> 12:31.064
I love that you pay.

12:34.345 --> 12:39.974
Seriously, though, I just love
watching you do anything.

12:40.117 --> 12:43.015
I love it... I love you, Alexis.
I love you.

12:47.658 --> 12:49.225
Oh, shit.

12:50.628 --> 12:56.223
We just said more than once
we're gonna keep it light.

12:56.700 --> 13:00.395
- We work together, we're friends.
- That's what I'm supposed to say.

13:00.538 --> 13:03.869
Right? I mean, I'm supposed to be
the relationship tough guy, you know?

13:04.041 --> 13:05.199
I'm the dude.

13:05.376 --> 13:07.000
The dude can't just come out with:

13:07.178 --> 13:10.213
"I've loved you since the moment
I first saw you, pounding out...

13:10.347 --> 13:12.472
...a lender's agreement,
eating Cocoa Puffs...

13:12.616 --> 13:14.650
...while some pretty boy
drooled over you."

13:14.785 --> 13:18.286
- Michi Yamana.
- Yeah, Michi Yamana. Dick.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.750
So I love you, madly.

13:21.892 --> 13:23.721
Sorry. l... l... I know I need to stop.

13:23.861 --> 13:26.691
Now, stop. Just stop speaking,
Dustin. Just shut your mouth.

13:26.831 --> 13:30.833
I'm sorry. Wow, kamikaze, huh?
See, this is what you do to me.

13:30.968 --> 13:32.968
- What do I say here, but...?
- I'm sorry.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.832
But do you know how hard it's been
trying to play it cool?

13:36.006 --> 13:37.664
- It's been five weeks.
- I know.

13:37.842 --> 13:39.375
We haven't even had sex.

13:42.746 --> 13:46.509
Well, that's why we're here, Alexis.
I wanted to talk to you about...

13:48.085 --> 13:49.982
I think I'm ready
to take the next step.

13:51.422 --> 13:54.013
Sex isn't a step, Dustin.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.956
Being exclusive would be a step
or moving in together is a step.

13:58.095 --> 13:59.594
Then let's move in together.

14:04.902 --> 14:06.492
I need you to take me home.

14:06.637 --> 14:10.002
But it just felt so right.
It just felt so right.

14:10.174 --> 14:11.536
No, it does, it feels right.

14:11.709 --> 14:16.508
Just not right now.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.840
"Just not right now."

14:24.889 --> 14:26.354
<i>Oh, God.</i>

14:34.732 --> 14:36.697
God, I'm a fag.

14:41.038 --> 14:44.301
- Dude, you canceled Spice.
- It was like 21 bucks a month, dude.

14:47.511 --> 14:48.908
Someone had a rough night.

14:50.648 --> 14:52.409
I'm Mr. Right...

14:52.550 --> 14:55.414
...just not Mr. Right Now.

14:57.188 --> 15:00.553
What...? What does that even mean?
What does that even mean?

15:00.691 --> 15:03.225
- I told her I loved her...
- Oh, no.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.018
What?

15:05.496 --> 15:09.532
I went in early. No, no, I know.
I went in a little early, but she...

15:11.335 --> 15:15.303
- Thanks for your support. Sweet.
- Dustin.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.336
Dusty, look.

15:19.510 --> 15:22.078
This too shall pass, all right?

15:22.246 --> 15:25.213
But that journey begins...

15:25.349 --> 15:27.417
...with self-exploration.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.846
And I'm holding the map, Dusty.

15:29.987 --> 15:31.486
Hey.

15:32.156 --> 15:34.884
Kid, I got your 'bate crate.

15:35.025 --> 15:37.059
You know how much
you love your 'bate crate.

15:37.194 --> 15:39.489
"I'm like comfort food for your penis."

15:42.466 --> 15:44.591
- What do I do?
- Okay.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.235
What do you do?
Okay, let's look at the options.

15:47.371 --> 15:51.100
Stalk her. But you're never gonna
be with her. Love her from a distance.

15:51.275 --> 15:54.367
Never have a family but you could
love her kids from a distance.

15:54.369 --> 15:57.632
- Or I could just hire you.
- No.

15:57.672 --> 15:59.637
- Why not?
- I don't fuck with family.

15:59.908 --> 16:03.136
Well, technically
we're not blood-related. Right?

16:03.278 --> 16:05.107
Go to bed, Dust.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.271
You're serious. Okay.

16:08.417 --> 16:10.314
I'll get serious.

16:10.619 --> 16:12.710
If I do this...

16:15.190 --> 16:19.124
If I do this, I'm gonna make it
the finest Tank-ing of my career.

16:19.294 --> 16:20.452
My fucking masterpiece.

16:20.629 --> 16:23.220
She'll lose her shit
like a shit collector with amnesia.

16:23.398 --> 16:27.696
I'm talking about a Turkish twist,
epic mindfuck of a Tank-ing, okay?

16:27.836 --> 16:32.532
Her brain'll be rocking back and forth
in the shower for like three weeks.

16:32.674 --> 16:35.743
Okay? I'm talking about
demonic fucking Tank.

16:35.877 --> 16:37.342
I'll be flying up into the sky.

16:37.479 --> 16:41.982
She's gonna cry tears that form
"Call Dusty" on the ground.

16:42.117 --> 16:44.845
Yes? Am I doing it?
Tell me I'm doing it.

16:47.022 --> 16:49.522
Okay, that was weird.
And I'm not sure that...

16:49.658 --> 16:52.192
Listen, rain check, maybe though.

16:52.360 --> 16:56.157
Wow, can't believe I almost resorted
to emotional terrorism. I'm sorry.

16:56.331 --> 16:58.831
You're sweet.
Next time with the next one, maybe.

16:58.967 --> 17:00.830
- Thank you.
- I'm here.

17:02.471 --> 17:04.505
A little crazy. Sweet, crazy mostly.

17:09.978 --> 17:10.478
Don't say a word.

17:34.669 --> 17:37.033
God! Son of...

17:37.172 --> 17:41.106
Why? That stupid...

17:44.346 --> 17:46.846
Hi. Tank Turner,
Customer Satisfaction.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.379
How may I help you today?

17:48.517 --> 17:51.677
<i>Excuse me, do you have any idea
how long I was just on hold?</i>

17:51.820 --> 17:53.751
<i>It's been like an hour and a half.</i>

17:53.889 --> 17:55.388
<i>Hello. In your manual...</i>

17:55.524 --> 17:58.184
<i>... you've expressed a possibility
of some odor issues.</i>

17:58.360 --> 18:03.090
<i>"Faint aroma," it says here on page 7.
Come on. "Faint aroma"? Bullshit.</i>

18:03.265 --> 18:05.925
<i>It smells like burnt fucking hair, dude.</i>

18:06.101 --> 18:10.535
<i>Because apparently
I paid 49.90-motherfucking-5...</i>

18:10.672 --> 18:15.141
<i>... so that my sweet-ass condo smells
like some Korean cat barbecue.</i>

18:15.277 --> 18:17.208
<i>- Touchdown.
- You lose. You lose.</i>

18:17.345 --> 18:18.969
You suck.

18:19.814 --> 18:23.816
Sir, I will gladly give you a refund, but
that's not gonna solve your problem.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.781
New girl.

18:29.224 --> 18:30.985
<i>New girl</i>

18:31.826 --> 18:33.484
<i>Ooh, new girl</i>

18:35.931 --> 18:37.760
Did the emotional terrorist win?

18:37.899 --> 18:40.934
I just... You know, it's funny.
I never noticed your highlights...

18:41.069 --> 18:43.103
...until somebody actually
said something.

18:43.271 --> 18:44.804
They're actually really good.

18:45.173 --> 18:47.764
- Just tell me how it works.
- Let me make this clear.

18:47.909 --> 18:50.910
Before she can love you,
she has to hate me.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.876
But before she can hate me,
she has to like me.

18:54.015 --> 18:56.106
That may be
the hardest part of the equation.

18:56.251 --> 18:57.579
So I set up the meet-cute.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.014
In every movie,
the stars meet in some cutesy way.

19:00.155 --> 19:03.190
Since every woman is looking
for that dreamy, witty, goofy guy...

19:03.325 --> 19:06.861
...of their sitcom, rom-com fantasies,
I've gotta be that thing.

19:07.028 --> 19:08.254
Here.

19:08.430 --> 19:10.794
Lucky slap on the ass. Hit it.

19:46.534 --> 19:47.828
Are you okay?

19:51.773 --> 19:54.740
That was rough. I'm Alexis.

20:04.252 --> 20:05.751
Wow, that looked really real.

20:06.888 --> 20:09.320
- Is that real?
- It's real and it hurts.

20:09.457 --> 20:12.287
Okay. So, like, what happens now?
You come back every day...

20:12.460 --> 20:15.324
...for a couple weeks. Slowly,
eventually you build her trust.

20:15.697 --> 20:18.231
- Daddy bee's got the honey.
- That's her number.

20:18.400 --> 20:21.196
- Let's go eat.
- How...? How did...?

20:21.903 --> 20:24.836
Now, remember, she's classy.
So maybe a fast-food joint.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.836
Or wait, wait, drive-through.

20:26.975 --> 20:29.942
Do I tell you what flavor of jam
to eat out of your boss's ass?

20:30.078 --> 20:32.711
No. Dusty, it's what I do, okay?

20:32.760 --> 20:35.988
You gotta trust me.
She's not gonna know what hit her.

20:37.899 --> 20:39.599
All right. Good luck.

20:45.006 --> 20:47.040
- Do not wear that, please.
- What am I doing?

20:47.175 --> 20:49.106
Just take this.
This is what you're doing.

20:49.243 --> 20:52.938
Clean the pipes. It's mandatory to
flush them out after a relationship.

20:53.081 --> 20:55.649
That's disgusting.
But seriously, what's wrong with me?

20:55.783 --> 20:57.373
Dustin's a good guy.

20:57.518 --> 21:00.109
- You're such a fucking girl sometimes.
- Pretty good guy.

21:00.254 --> 21:01.753
A good guy? Who cares?

21:01.889 --> 21:05.584
A good guy is, like,
somebody that your parents dig or...

21:05.760 --> 21:09.318
- Listen to me. In the real world... Ami.
- I'm listening.

21:09.497 --> 21:12.088
- In the real world...
- Yes.

21:12.266 --> 21:15.824
What if he's a good man
with a good heart...

21:16.003 --> 21:19.095
...and he's smart? And if
he's not too rough on the eyes?

21:19.240 --> 21:23.572
If "ifs" and "buts" were cocks and nuts,
I'd be getting gangbanged right now.

21:23.711 --> 21:27.247
Seriously. But it's that I wanna teach
you something that took me, like...

21:27.381 --> 21:29.847
...years and years of promiscuity
to learn, okay?

21:29.984 --> 21:31.847
- What is this outfit?
- It's aweso...

21:31.986 --> 21:33.849
Hey, how many guys
have you slept with?

21:33.988 --> 21:36.818
- Like, total? Three, right?
- Two.

21:38.593 --> 21:40.957
- Two?
- I'm a serial monogamist.

21:41.129 --> 21:45.188
Well, okay. That's, like, the first
big, huge problem right there.

21:45.366 --> 21:48.401
Didn't anybody ever tell you
that you have to suck a few frogs...

21:48.536 --> 21:51.366
...before you get to suck a prince?

21:51.506 --> 21:53.506
I believe it's "kiss."

21:53.641 --> 21:55.470
Pretend it's a year abroad, you know?

21:55.610 --> 22:00.306
But instead of going to Europe, you're
gonna bang a whole shitload of dudes.

22:00.448 --> 22:03.108
- It's awesome.
- I haven't been drunk in a long time.

22:03.251 --> 22:05.512
Good. You need it. You need it.

22:05.653 --> 22:08.984
Now tell me something.
What do you see in this box?

22:10.458 --> 22:14.255
- I see into the...
- No, in the box.

22:14.762 --> 22:17.296
An inordinate amount
of masturbatory aides...

22:17.431 --> 22:21.467
...which some,
I pray, are novelty-sized.

22:23.004 --> 22:25.595
Oh, my God.

22:26.140 --> 22:28.902
Okay, that will do nicely.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.509
- You, show her a good time tonight.
- I love you.

22:31.646 --> 22:33.270
- Show her a good time.
- I love you.

22:33.414 --> 22:35.709
- Such a good time. Love you.
- Have a great night.

22:35.850 --> 22:37.144
Don't be scared without me.

22:37.285 --> 22:40.149
- I'll be back. I'll be back.
- Yeah. I'll be waiting...

22:40.288 --> 22:43.414
- She's my roommate.
- I bet she gives great head.

22:43.558 --> 22:46.058
Actually, I'm sure she does.

22:46.227 --> 22:47.794
You're pretty drunk.

22:47.962 --> 22:50.656
I'm pretty ready to rock.

22:53.134 --> 22:55.031
Oh, boy.

22:55.169 --> 22:57.863
Tank, is this a Mustang?

22:58.005 --> 22:59.402
It's a GTO.

23:00.107 --> 23:04.541
- A... Whatever that means.
- Yeah.

23:05.413 --> 23:08.949
Well, listen, I just wanna warn you,
my stereo's busted.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.583
Oh, that's cool. That's cool.

23:15.756 --> 23:20.623
Hey, this is my...
I almost lost my virginity to this song.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.165
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

23:37.678 --> 23:41.009
- This is a first, Tank.
- Yeah, me too.

23:41.148 --> 23:43.944
Should we sit front row and center?

23:46.120 --> 23:47.983
Oh, wild.

23:49.357 --> 23:51.357
Yeah, can we get
two Long Island Iced Teas?

23:51.492 --> 23:53.719
And put the chop-chop on that, lady.

23:53.895 --> 23:57.396
Could you make mine a double?
And two shots of tequila, please.

24:03.404 --> 24:04.903
Okay, let's slow down, princess.

24:05.039 --> 24:08.006
You're getting sloshed
like it's your prom night here.

24:08.910 --> 24:12.377
- I never went to prom. I never went.
- No shock there. I believe that.

24:12.513 --> 24:14.376
I had the date, I had the dress.

24:14.515 --> 24:17.209
But prom was the night my dog
bit my sister in the neck...

24:17.351 --> 24:19.112
...and we had to put him down.
- Shit.

24:19.253 --> 24:21.981
And I will never... Oh, my goodness.

24:22.123 --> 24:24.714
- ever forget the horror
in little Fraggle's eyes...

24:24.859 --> 24:27.928
...as his paw went limp in my hand.

24:28.095 --> 24:30.891
It was horrible. Blood.
It was just, like:

24:31.065 --> 24:34.100
I'm sure that's not the only thing
that's gone limp in your hand.

24:34.235 --> 24:37.168
I will say it. In all sincerity,
that sucks hard.

24:37.305 --> 24:39.236
It's sad to lose a pet.

24:39.373 --> 24:41.202
Where do they learn how to do this?

24:41.342 --> 24:44.502
- Well, I taught them a few things.
- I wanna know.

24:48.316 --> 24:50.441
That's incredible.

24:52.486 --> 24:54.577
What is that?

24:54.722 --> 24:58.019
- What is that?
- I think we should just fuck tonight.

25:13.074 --> 25:15.665
That looks pretty.

25:15.810 --> 25:18.140
- I'm gonna go pee.
- Got it.

25:20.915 --> 25:21.982
Hey, I can't talk.

25:22.116 --> 25:24.741
- Where are you?
- I'm out, I'm seeing a band.

25:24.885 --> 25:27.510
They suck, but I'm seeing them
so I really can't talk.

25:27.655 --> 25:30.849
- Put your "Guitar Hero" down.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

25:30.992 --> 25:34.220
I'm not playing "Guitar Hero."
It's Saturday night. I'm out.

25:34.395 --> 25:36.861
Just put it down.
We have problems.

25:36.998 --> 25:38.292
All right. What's the story?

25:38.466 --> 25:42.969
I am drunk and he's either
the biggest asshole in America...

25:43.137 --> 25:46.104
...or trying to convince me
he's the biggest asshole in America.

25:46.240 --> 25:50.299
Either way, even a broken clock is
right twice a day, but this guy...

25:50.444 --> 25:53.104
Come on. How better to
appreciate Dustin than to do this?

25:53.247 --> 25:55.815
Than to bang this guy,
who's obviously far inferior...

25:55.950 --> 25:59.019
...but probably hung like Seabiscuit.
Right?

25:59.153 --> 26:03.019
Now go. Go and bang. Bang
like you have never "bung" before.

26:03.157 --> 26:05.748
And do it for Dustin.

26:07.661 --> 26:09.058
Jesus.

26:09.230 --> 26:11.696
- Baby doll...
- Hi.

26:11.832 --> 26:13.160
- Hi.
- I'm Alexis.

26:13.300 --> 26:15.231
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

26:15.369 --> 26:19.030
And when it comes to love,
there's only one thing you can trust.

26:19.173 --> 26:22.208
It's not your friends,
it's not your head.

26:22.343 --> 26:25.708
It's that little voice
inside your clamburger.

26:29.517 --> 26:31.847
"Listen to me."

26:40.528 --> 26:43.153
Watch this. It's a game.
It's called "Who's at the Door?"

26:43.330 --> 26:45.227
And I look out the peephole.

26:45.599 --> 26:47.360
It's the mailman.

26:51.939 --> 26:55.031
Would it hurt you to play with her tits?
Help me out.

26:57.278 --> 26:58.970
You can stay there. That's good.

26:59.113 --> 27:01.579
Oh, you grab that.
I'll get the next one.

27:01.715 --> 27:04.113
- There won't be a next time.
- Lucky me.

27:10.324 --> 27:14.383
And our motto, basically,
is, "Without air, we..."

27:14.562 --> 27:17.062
"Without air, we cannot live."

27:17.598 --> 27:18.630
- Stop.
- Right.

27:18.799 --> 27:21.333
I get it. You're a dick.

27:21.469 --> 27:23.867
I'm sufficiently offended.

27:24.171 --> 27:25.795
Done.

27:48.429 --> 27:51.327
Coming up?

28:03.844 --> 28:05.844
Suit yourself.

28:07.915 --> 28:10.882
Enjoy the long ride home.

28:18.259 --> 28:19.553
I'm going home, okay?

28:19.693 --> 28:21.761
Why am I going home?
Because I'm going home.

28:21.896 --> 28:26.092
I'm getting in the car. Eyes
in the game and the head in the ball.

28:26.233 --> 28:28.028
Can't do it.

28:28.045 --> 28:32.081
<i>...and you're gonna go home
and maybe she'll call you mañana.</i>

28:32.216 --> 28:34.113
Why would she call me?
She'll call Dusty.

28:34.251 --> 28:37.286
Because she's what? Dusty's
girlfriend. Follow the bouncing ball.

28:37.421 --> 28:40.149
She is Dusty's girlfriend.

28:40.824 --> 28:42.789
Listen to me.

28:46.163 --> 28:50.131
What is wrong with you, asshole?

29:02.980 --> 29:08.677
You asked me to trust you.

29:09.486 --> 29:12.419
- And I trusted you.
- Done.

29:12.956 --> 29:14.045
Somehow.

29:14.191 --> 29:15.952
Some way.

29:18.362 --> 29:19.929
Thank you.

29:24.735 --> 29:26.496
Dude, you did it. She just called.

29:26.637 --> 29:29.365
Okay, quote,
"I just had the worst night of my life."

29:29.506 --> 29:32.166
"I just had the worst night of my life."
You did it, man.

29:32.309 --> 29:33.637
We're having lunch tomorrow.

29:33.777 --> 29:35.868
Tank, we're having lunch.
Can you believe it?

29:36.013 --> 29:39.207
Dude, when it comes to being
an asshole, you are a genius.

29:39.349 --> 29:41.349
Genius.

29:44.421 --> 29:46.045
Anything for a friend.

29:47.524 --> 29:50.923
So about the other night.

29:51.094 --> 29:53.162
Okay, I was stupid. I was stupid.

29:53.330 --> 29:57.093
It's just... I've never gone this far
with a girl, emotionally.

29:57.234 --> 29:59.234
- And I just lost it.
- Slow down. Slow down.

29:59.369 --> 30:01.460
I was stupid and harsh...

30:01.605 --> 30:03.104
...and I'm sorry.

30:03.240 --> 30:06.605
Last night I went out
with a real asshole. Horrible.

30:06.743 --> 30:09.368
It just made me realize
that guys like you are so rare.

30:11.682 --> 30:14.080
But it also made me realize
how few guys I've dated.

30:14.217 --> 30:16.308
How few guys
I've actually gone out with.

30:16.453 --> 30:19.021
Like, none. I need to date
and you need to date...

30:19.156 --> 30:22.089
...other people. I'm just saying that...

30:22.225 --> 30:26.557
What I'm trying to say is that
I wanna start over as friends first.

30:26.730 --> 30:29.230
Like, be friends.

30:29.366 --> 30:31.764
I like you as my friend.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.404
Start over...

30:40.544 --> 30:42.771
...as friends first.
- Friends.

30:42.913 --> 30:44.947
Like Harry and Sally.

30:48.285 --> 30:51.912
I think the point of that movie was that
men and women can't just be friends.

30:52.055 --> 30:55.056
No, no, no,
they can be just friends...

30:55.192 --> 30:58.022
...even date other people,
as long as they end up together...

30:58.195 --> 31:00.991
...in the end. As long
as they end up together, right?

31:01.164 --> 31:02.322
Yeah.

31:02.499 --> 31:08.265
This is fun. You know, I'm gonna go
because my sister is getting married.

31:08.405 --> 31:10.439
It's an on-again, off-again,
on-again thing.

31:10.574 --> 31:14.269
She's freaking out, treating me like
her assistant so I'm running all over.

31:14.411 --> 31:16.945
I'm really glad we had this talk,
you know?

31:19.516 --> 31:22.050
Dude. You check out that sandwich
they got downstairs?

31:22.185 --> 31:24.480
Bread is, like,
two slices of freaking pizza, man.

31:24.621 --> 31:25.949
Only in America. Fuck me.

31:26.089 --> 31:29.625
<i>Clean air probably shouldn't stink
like flaming ass nougat.</i>

31:29.760 --> 31:31.794
I got a real fucking tough guy
over here.

31:31.928 --> 31:35.429
I got a guy on the verge of a five-state
killing spree. Do you wanna?

31:35.565 --> 31:37.724
Ready? Three, two, one.

31:37.901 --> 31:40.936
- Let me transfer you to my supervisor.
- Let me transfer you to my supervisor.

31:41.104 --> 31:43.502
- Make me proud.
- Kill it.

31:44.041 --> 31:46.166
Hi, this is Supervisor Eugene Lenay.

31:46.309 --> 31:48.274
- How may I help you?
- How may I help you?

31:50.047 --> 31:51.614
- Please hold.
- Please hold.

31:54.418 --> 31:56.611
Treat her like a bowling ball.

31:56.753 --> 31:58.081
Strike.

31:58.221 --> 31:59.948
Dust, hold on one second, all right?

32:00.090 --> 32:03.284
Sir, I looked into the problem
and it'll actually fix itself.

32:03.460 --> 32:05.050
- What's up, kid?
- You failed, Tank.

32:05.228 --> 32:07.091
She wants to see other people.

32:07.264 --> 32:09.093
She said she wants
to see other people?

32:09.232 --> 32:11.766
She did. That's why
you're gonna take her out again.

32:11.935 --> 32:14.503
Except this time,
you're gonna get seriously diabolical.

32:14.638 --> 32:17.104
I'm talking public defecation.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.832
Dust, you're freaking me out here,
okay? Tank-ing is a subtle art.

32:20.977 --> 32:23.773
You can't go in there crazy
like a dragon with a hemorrhoid.

32:23.914 --> 32:27.006
Besides, what makes you think
she'd ever wanna speak to me again?

32:28.151 --> 32:30.116
Don't worry, I'm taking care of that.

32:30.253 --> 32:32.617
No, you're not. You do... Dust.

32:32.923 --> 32:34.456
<i>Don't do anything, okay? Listen.</i>

32:36.093 --> 32:38.753
I have to teach a training seminar
10 minutes ago. Dusty?

32:40.831 --> 32:42.262
All right.

32:44.134 --> 32:46.395
- You're late, Tank.
- I know.

32:47.237 --> 32:48.895
- You're Tank, right?
- Are you a cop?

32:49.039 --> 32:51.903
No, Roger's friend Sonny
said you fix things.

32:52.042 --> 32:53.234
Walk with me.

32:53.376 --> 32:54.500
- You're late.
- Thank you.

32:54.644 --> 32:57.872
I'm going crazy without her.
Shit-in-the-bed-and-roll-around crazy.

32:58.014 --> 32:59.103
- You're late.
- Shut up.

32:59.249 --> 33:01.647
Okay, religious girl.
How do I bump into her?

33:01.785 --> 33:02.943
- You're late.
- No shit.

33:03.086 --> 33:04.949
She's a high-school English teacher.

33:05.088 --> 33:08.316
Guy can't really hang around a
high school these days, unfortunately.

33:08.458 --> 33:10.458
- She gets her hair done Tuesdays.
- Love it.

33:10.627 --> 33:14.219
What'd you do? Foot in your mouth?
Foot-long in somebody's mouth? Facts.

33:14.397 --> 33:17.728
Let's say you're gonna have to be
a real asshole to make me look good.

33:17.868 --> 33:19.401
It's what I do.

33:19.536 --> 33:21.797
- You're late.
- Yes.

33:21.938 --> 33:24.233
Everybody, you're late.
Don't let it happen again.

33:24.374 --> 33:25.736
I'm Tank and I will be brief.

33:25.876 --> 33:28.342
Here at Airmeister
we have two rules.

33:28.478 --> 33:30.478
No refunds.

33:30.614 --> 33:34.673
The beauty of an air purifier is that
nobody can prove that it doesn't work.

33:34.818 --> 33:38.183
Amanda, you saucy tart.
I want somebody really pissed off.

33:38.321 --> 33:40.685
I'm talking about DEFCON 2
level of anger.

33:40.824 --> 33:42.152
Who do you got for me, baby?

33:42.292 --> 33:46.385
<i>I have just the one for you. She's
furious and asked for you by name.</i>

33:46.563 --> 33:48.130
Put her through.

33:50.634 --> 33:54.636
Tank Turner, Customer Satisfaction.
How may I help you?

33:54.771 --> 33:56.702
<i>Before we even discuss
what I received...</i>

33:56.840 --> 33:58.635
<i>... which is a whole other mystery...</i>

33:58.775 --> 34:00.740
...I demand an explanation
for yesterday.

34:00.877 --> 34:03.946
Ma'am, I'm fully concerned.
What happened yesterday?

34:04.080 --> 34:06.239
Are you gay?
Or are you just an asshole?

34:06.383 --> 34:11.112
Oh, ma'am. Profanity is superfluous
because no verbal affront...

34:11.254 --> 34:14.414
...could be as devastating to me
as your dissatisfaction.

34:14.558 --> 34:16.125
Dissatisfaction?

34:16.259 --> 34:20.795
Yes, I mean if the unit's performance
or lack thereof has left you frustrated...

34:20.931 --> 34:24.295
See, I never saw your unit. I gave
you a chance and you didn't deliver.

34:24.434 --> 34:26.195
Ma'am, you're upset.

34:26.335 --> 34:30.338
I'm upset. I'm upset that you will
never, ever know what it's like...

34:30.473 --> 34:34.440
...to sit on a hot, sweaty
summer night...

34:34.578 --> 34:38.409
...and let that unit blow
its glorious bounty all over your face.

34:39.282 --> 34:41.509
You think after the shit
you put me through...

34:41.650 --> 34:45.482
...that I called just so
you could talk dirty to me?

34:45.621 --> 34:48.213
I gave you a one-time
free hall pass for sex.

34:48.358 --> 34:49.947
<i>Good sex. Hot sex.</i>

34:50.126 --> 34:52.989
l... l... I fucking roofied myself.

34:55.098 --> 34:56.529
I'm a little confused. Amanda?

34:56.666 --> 34:58.529
<i>You're confused?
That makes two of us...</i>

34:58.668 --> 35:01.828
...because I don't know what kind
of asshole acts like an asshole...

35:01.972 --> 35:06.065
...and then when it actually comes
time to be an asshole, walks away.

35:06.209 --> 35:08.106
Like a total asshole.

35:08.245 --> 35:10.939
Making me look like
an even bigger asshole...

35:11.081 --> 35:16.380
...for offering some big-ass asshole
asshole-sex in the first place.

35:16.519 --> 35:18.587
What kind of asshole are you?

35:21.024 --> 35:23.285
This is actually a personal call.

35:23.493 --> 35:25.322
Dude, you are so hired.

35:25.729 --> 35:27.660
Excuse me for a second.

35:27.964 --> 35:29.429
Shit.

35:29.833 --> 35:31.127
Asshole.

35:46.116 --> 35:48.810
Sorry. Offer expired.

35:54.891 --> 35:59.451
Did you really think roses and a poem
would give you a second chance?

35:59.629 --> 36:02.095
You rhymed "apology"
with "apologetically."

36:02.232 --> 36:04.664
- I'm...
- I just felt bad, okay?

36:04.801 --> 36:06.835
You're right,
I do owe you an explanation.

36:06.970 --> 36:09.538
I didn't sleep with you
because you're not attractive.

36:09.673 --> 36:11.104
- There, I said it.
- Oh, thanks.

36:11.241 --> 36:13.332
Thank you so much
because you saved me...

36:13.476 --> 36:16.067
...from what could've been
the worst decision of my life.

36:16.212 --> 36:18.371
- And I've eaten sushi in Tijuana.
- One-nothing.

36:18.515 --> 36:21.209
You're below my standards.
Even for a one-night pity fuck.

36:21.351 --> 36:25.547
- And I've taken down some real hogs.
- Yeah, hogs, cows, sheep.

36:25.689 --> 36:28.155
I bet your sex life is
a regular heavy-petting zoo.

36:28.291 --> 36:30.518
You know what?
You're what we call a two-bagger.

36:30.660 --> 36:32.751
That means I have to wear
a bag on my head...

36:32.929 --> 36:35.293
...just in case
the one on yours breaks.

36:35.732 --> 36:37.424
You sure it's not just a size thing?

36:37.600 --> 36:41.466
Because it's gotta be tough standing at
a urinal, pissing on your own testicles.

36:41.604 --> 36:43.569
At least I can hide my shame
in my pants.

36:43.707 --> 36:45.468
What really sucks is having an ass...

36:45.608 --> 36:49.235
...the size of a miniature
Mediterranean donkey. That suck...

36:49.980 --> 36:51.809
- Don't...
- You think that's too big?

36:51.948 --> 36:54.312
You think that's too small?

37:12.469 --> 37:15.129
So you said do nothing,
but I did something, totally small.

37:15.271 --> 37:18.499
I sent her a couple hundred bucks
worth of roses and a kick-ass poem.

37:18.641 --> 37:20.538
A few stanzas, no big deal.
Did she call?

37:20.944 --> 37:22.204
No, she didn't.

37:22.345 --> 37:25.278
Dusty, these women, they have
a way of getting into our head.

37:25.415 --> 37:27.415
I'm gonna give you
some fresh perspective.

37:27.550 --> 37:29.641
Listen to me.
This girl, I'm getting a hunch.

37:29.786 --> 37:31.281
She's built for destruction.

37:31.325 --> 37:34.058
Yeah. It's time to let her go.
Maybe get some... You know.

37:34.079 --> 37:35.524
Just let her go. Move on.

37:35.531 --> 37:38.464
I love her, Tank. I care more
about this girl than I do myself.

37:38.600 --> 37:41.032
- You will never understand that.
- It's new to me.

37:41.169 --> 37:43.430
She said she wants to be friends.

37:45.374 --> 37:47.101
You know what? I'll give her a friend.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.573
I'll be the best goddamn friend
she ever had.

38:21.543 --> 38:22.871
Today was a good day for us.

38:23.045 --> 38:25.409
We made eye contact,
although I couldn't gauge...

38:26.782 --> 38:27.871
I gotta run.

38:39.628 --> 38:40.660
<i>Turn.</i>

38:48.303 --> 38:49.961
She's really tough to read.

38:50.105 --> 38:51.502
Really tough to read.

38:51.640 --> 38:56.006
I felt like... I felt like
she was a bit distracted.

38:58.413 --> 39:00.777
Totally. Hey, can we do this later?

39:36.718 --> 39:38.581
It's hot.

39:43.225 --> 39:44.917
Where you going?

40:08.283 --> 40:10.510
She's seeing someone.

40:12.721 --> 40:14.152
Dusty.

40:14.289 --> 40:16.880
What are you doing?
You're scaring the shit out of me.

40:17.025 --> 40:19.685
Sitting in the dark like a vampire,
you creepy weirdo.

40:19.828 --> 40:21.896
She's seeing someone.

40:22.964 --> 40:26.556
We don't go out at night.
I get her voice mail after 10.

40:26.702 --> 40:28.793
She's seeing someone.

40:28.937 --> 40:31.665
- And I'm gonna find out who.
- I'm gonna take back "weirdo."

40:31.807 --> 40:34.298
You're giving off more of
a full-blown serial psycho...

40:34.543 --> 40:36.374
...crawlspace-full-of-skin-sombreros
vibe.

40:36.645 --> 40:37.939
Stop. Intervention time.

40:38.113 --> 40:40.481
It's time to forget about Alexis.
Look at me, all right?

40:40.649 --> 40:45.413
It's time to wipe the cobwebs
off your cock and stick something.

40:45.687 --> 40:47.550
I don't think she'd be cool with that.

40:47.689 --> 40:51.225
Look at me, please. You definitely...
You don't need her permission.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.586
You need to get laid.

40:52.728 --> 40:55.490
And if you'll listen to me,
I bet I could make that happen.

40:55.631 --> 40:58.962
This is one of the most important
things that any man can do.

40:59.101 --> 41:00.634
A haircut?

41:01.003 --> 41:03.003
Yes, Dusty, a haircut. Look at me.

41:03.138 --> 41:05.502
You look like Chewbacca and
Sasquatch had a baby...

41:05.641 --> 41:08.107
...the baby took a shit,
and that shit was blinded...

41:08.243 --> 41:09.970
...moments before styling your hair.

41:10.112 --> 41:13.010
- A bit harsh.
- Appointment for Dusty, please.

41:13.181 --> 41:14.873
Grab a seat.

41:16.718 --> 41:19.286
Great article. I've read that.
Sorry to interrupt.

41:20.489 --> 41:23.080
My associate here is looking for
a stylist he can trust.

41:23.225 --> 41:27.523
And this place was recommended to
us by a woman in our prayer group.

41:28.130 --> 41:30.562
Well, is he looking
for something simple or?

41:30.699 --> 41:33.393
Maybe a what-would-Jesus-'do.

41:37.139 --> 41:39.730
- I'm Hilary.
- Hilary, my name is Tank.

41:39.875 --> 41:41.840
- This is Dustin.
- Hi.

41:43.779 --> 41:47.246
So I've got an $85 haircut
so you could have a meet-cute?

41:47.249 --> 41:49.283
Oh, it's $ 110. Worth every penny.

41:49.418 --> 41:51.349
In return,
I'm gonna get you a date with...

41:51.486 --> 41:55.249
Let's just call her a confidence booster.
A slow, fat one down the middle.

41:55.390 --> 41:57.014
I hope that's a baseball metaphor.

41:57.159 --> 42:00.319
This pitch is in your wheelhouse.
Grand slam, upper deck. Game over.

42:00.462 --> 42:03.087
- Hey, beauty queen.
- Hey, I have a question. I'm sorry.

42:03.231 --> 42:05.356
I've got these little...
Is there any way...?

42:05.500 --> 42:07.329
Yeah.

42:08.403 --> 42:09.970
- Shit.
- I'm so sorry.

42:10.105 --> 42:12.537
No, I'm sorry. Sorry.

42:12.674 --> 42:16.505
- Is there any other way we could...?
- Yeah, okay.

42:16.678 --> 42:19.178
Guess what.
We're all set for tonight.

42:19.781 --> 42:21.542
Okay, hold still.

42:22.884 --> 42:26.078
What about, like, frosting my tips?

42:26.221 --> 42:27.515
What are you, a Mini-Wheat?

42:27.656 --> 42:30.623
Listen, this girl's not Alexis.
She's got a bed built for sex...

42:30.759 --> 42:32.918
...not stuffed animals.
- Wait, what?

42:33.061 --> 42:36.028
How do you know that Alexis
has stuffed animals on her bed?

42:45.440 --> 42:46.507
- Wait.
- Oh, my.

42:46.642 --> 42:49.404
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God...

42:49.544 --> 42:52.010
This stuff happens in salons.
Sometimes it's fixable.

42:52.180 --> 42:54.145
- Tell him it's fixable.
- I'm gonna throw up.

42:54.282 --> 42:56.145
Makeup, little shading,
maybe some glue.

42:56.284 --> 42:57.783
How about an eyebrow toupee?

42:57.919 --> 43:00.112
- Where's my eyebrow?
- I don't know what to say.

43:00.255 --> 43:03.222
Oh, God, kill me. Kill me. Kill me!
Where's my eyebrow?

43:03.358 --> 43:04.447
That's a new look.

43:04.593 --> 43:07.457
- You can fix it, right?
- Sure, just pop into my DeLorean.

43:07.596 --> 43:09.323
- It's in the back.
- Don't be a bitch.

43:09.464 --> 43:12.533
- You're the bitch, bitch.
- Hey, gossip girls. Focus on my friend.

43:12.668 --> 43:15.362
- He's follicly deformed.
- Fuck my fucking mother.

43:15.504 --> 43:19.131
Let's come up with this... Dusty, unless
one's missing, nobody's gonna notice.

43:19.274 --> 43:20.432
Yeah.

43:20.575 --> 43:24.406
- Come here. Come here, sit down.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

43:25.013 --> 43:27.104
You gotta be brave, man.

43:28.116 --> 43:29.911
Oh, my God.

43:30.485 --> 43:32.382
- Do it. It's good.
- Come on. It's gonna...

43:32.521 --> 43:34.953
You know what?
I think it's gonna look great.

43:35.090 --> 43:38.489
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- It's gonna be really hot.

43:39.594 --> 43:41.559
- It better be hot.
- Yeah.

43:44.599 --> 43:46.360
Fuck.

43:47.069 --> 43:49.797
Bad, bad times.

43:51.506 --> 43:53.301
Oh, my fucking shit.

43:55.043 --> 43:56.667
I'm coming.

43:59.414 --> 44:01.846
Oh, those are lovely.

44:02.551 --> 44:06.417
And I see
you've got a hairstyle change.

44:06.555 --> 44:10.455
- True.
- Come on in. I won't bite.

44:14.013 --> 44:16.104
They told me you were taller.

44:17.283 --> 44:19.817
Just for peace of mind,
the father of this child is?

44:19.985 --> 44:23.612
In the middle of a brutal divorce
with the mother of this child.

44:23.693 --> 44:24.919
Here you go.

44:24.961 --> 44:27.393
Lilies. Thoughtful.

44:28.605 --> 44:30.605
My friend said
he was one of the good guys.

44:30.977 --> 44:34.740
I've been known to be
a bit of a dog sometimes.

44:35.565 --> 44:37.064
- Should I take those?
- Oh, yes.

44:38.668 --> 44:40.736
I'm sorry, sitter's running a bit late.

44:40.870 --> 44:43.700
Can I get you something
to drink, cutie?

44:45.516 --> 44:47.379
I'll have what he's having.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.984
- What the fuck?
- What just happened?

44:50.120 --> 44:52.552
- He just said he wants...
- I just, I said...

44:52.690 --> 44:54.951
He looked at Liam,
licked his lips and said:

44:55.092 --> 44:57.626
- "I'll have what he's having."
- Okay, but what I meant...

44:57.645 --> 44:58.938
- You wanna breast-feed.
- What?

44:58.994 --> 45:00.322
I was just joking...

45:00.462 --> 45:01.927
- Can we just start over?
- Hi.

45:02.064 --> 45:05.725
- I just wanna start...
- Sorry, Laney, we don't need a sitter.

45:05.868 --> 45:08.960
Groucho here made a mark
about suckling at my teat...

45:09.104 --> 45:11.365
...and stealing my baby's milk...

45:11.507 --> 45:13.666
...and is consequently leaving.
- Okay.

45:13.809 --> 45:16.070
- Get the fuck out!
- Okay, I'm really sorry.

45:16.211 --> 45:18.506
- I'm just... I'm sorry.
- No. No more. Just get out.

45:18.681 --> 45:21.249
- I'm really sorry.
- Go, go.

45:22.317 --> 45:23.884
Come here.

45:28.624 --> 45:31.124
You got shot down...

45:31.260 --> 45:34.329
...in a blaze of glory.

45:35.164 --> 45:37.164
You cost me a job, man.

45:37.299 --> 45:41.426
I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you.
How much?

45:41.570 --> 45:44.400
- Forty... Fifty if it's past 11.
- Okay.

45:44.540 --> 45:47.700
Here's 60 for your trouble.
I'm really sorry.

45:47.843 --> 45:49.604
Sweet.

45:49.745 --> 45:53.611
Hey, for another 60,
I'll jerk you off in the parking garage.

45:54.483 --> 45:58.246
Jesus. Do I really
look that desperate?

46:26.262 --> 46:28.387
Alexis!

46:28.531 --> 46:30.599
Alexis!

46:31.500 --> 46:33.227
Alexis, I love you!

46:33.669 --> 46:37.637
I love you, Alexis.
I can't just be friends, okay?

46:38.140 --> 46:40.435
Alexis, come to the door.

46:42.745 --> 46:44.506
Come on.

46:45.514 --> 46:46.603
- Oh, Dobler.
- Hey, hey.

46:46.782 --> 46:50.716
Hi there. I'm so sorry,
your BFF's upstairs with another guy.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.484
Holy shit, what is
going on with your eyebrows?

46:53.622 --> 46:57.522
- Seriously, I think there's something...
- I'm sorry. She's got a guy up there?

46:57.660 --> 47:00.456
But they're just hanging out, right?
Is she seeing this guy?

47:00.596 --> 47:02.755
No, no, no.
No, no, just an occasional bang.

47:02.898 --> 47:05.398
No, no. God, no. How many times
have they gone out?

47:05.534 --> 47:08.694
- How many times have they...? Not...
- They don't go out ever.

47:08.837 --> 47:11.735
No, he just comes over and
he bangs, and then he leaves.

47:12.141 --> 47:14.300
- What?
- You know, she's doing this all for you.

47:14.443 --> 47:17.979
Think about it. She's up there with
her knees by her ears, getting railed...

47:18.147 --> 47:20.841
...so one day she can settle down
with a nice boy like you.

47:21.016 --> 47:22.549
- I love her. I love her.
- Dustin.

47:22.718 --> 47:25.616
- You'd better be ready. I'm serious.
- Alexis.

47:25.921 --> 47:28.353
Alexis. Ale...

47:31.560 --> 47:34.493
Dustin, what are you doing here?

47:35.264 --> 47:37.730
- What is he doing here?
- Well, this is my...

47:37.866 --> 47:39.695
It's Tank.

47:41.370 --> 47:44.371
- This is the guy you're with?
- No, I'm not with anyone.

47:44.506 --> 47:46.369
I'm not... We're not together.

47:46.508 --> 47:49.304
I mean, no offense, Tank,
but we're not...

47:49.545 --> 47:52.170
I told you. I told you that
I was gonna get out there...

47:52.348 --> 47:55.212
...and I was gonna see other people
and I was gonna date...

47:55.351 --> 47:57.351
...and get some experience
under my belt...

47:57.486 --> 48:01.613
...and live my life a little bit. For once
in my life, do something like that...

48:01.757 --> 48:04.052
...and that's exactly what I'm doing.

48:07.162 --> 48:09.162
- Should I go?
- Yes.

48:09.632 --> 48:10.858
- I'm gonna go.
- No, no, no.

48:11.000 --> 48:11.998
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Tank.

48:12.134 --> 48:14.600
- You know what? I'll go.
- No, you don't go, you stay.

48:14.737 --> 48:18.102
I should get going, I have a big day
tomorrow. My roommate's moving out.

48:18.240 --> 48:19.307
I have shit to do too.

48:19.441 --> 48:20.633
- Really?
- Bye.

48:20.776 --> 48:22.901
- I'll call you later.
- I'll call you later.

48:23.078 --> 48:24.406
- No, after you.
- No, you go.

48:24.580 --> 48:26.375
No, no, please, Tank. You go first.

48:26.548 --> 48:28.172
- All right.
- Fine.

48:31.854 --> 48:34.252
- How can I trust you?
- I don't know.

48:34.390 --> 48:38.221
Hey, I wasn't kidding.
You're out by tomorrow morning.

48:40.529 --> 48:42.187
Dusty...

48:52.341 --> 48:54.136
I thought so.

48:59.815 --> 49:02.543
So we remember
the words of Betty Friedan:

49:02.818 --> 49:07.014
"A woman has got to be able to say,
and not feel guilty:

49:08.190 --> 49:09.882
'Who am I...

49:10.826 --> 49:13.417
...and what do I want out of life?"'

49:14.130 --> 49:16.521
That's why my Women's Studies
program will be focused...

49:16.666 --> 49:21.328
...on the liberation,
celebration and exploration...

49:25.007 --> 49:26.438
...of you...

49:30.146 --> 49:31.679
...and you...

49:34.617 --> 49:36.241
...and you.

49:38.054 --> 49:42.056
Enjoy your weekend,
and please try to do so responsibly.

49:44.894 --> 49:47.792
The man is Oprah.

49:52.635 --> 49:55.704
Would you all excuse me
for just one second, please?

50:00.409 --> 50:02.374
- Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.
- Hey, Dad.

50:02.745 --> 50:06.679
If there's anything else I can get for
you, I'm always available, professor.

50:06.816 --> 50:11.114
One of my teaching assistants, and
a very hard-working young woman.

50:16.192 --> 50:20.888
Last night, I fucked her
within an inch of her life.

50:21.030 --> 50:23.860
True story. I'm jamming
her head through the headboard...

50:24.000 --> 50:26.432
...I flip her over, she screams,
"Give me a choker."

50:26.569 --> 50:29.832
I play the choirboy, "What's that?"
Star wipe to five minutes later...

50:29.972 --> 50:32.939
...she's bucking like an epileptic
at a strobe-light convention.

50:33.075 --> 50:34.142
I'm getting scared.

50:34.276 --> 50:37.106
As I'm working out the 911 phone call
in my head, she goes:

50:41.250 --> 50:43.318
Like an air bag.

50:45.688 --> 50:47.016
Now, that's a Tuesday night.

50:47.790 --> 50:49.016
You got a good gig, Dad.

50:50.326 --> 50:51.393
How you doing, son?

50:53.529 --> 50:54.596
Dusty kicked me out.

50:54.730 --> 50:58.197
In all fairness, I was accidentally
sleeping with his pseudo-girlfriend...

50:58.334 --> 51:00.902
...but I feel like shit.

51:01.037 --> 51:03.264
Son, let me tell you a story.

51:03.406 --> 51:06.236
December, 1977,
your mother, God rest her soul...

51:06.375 --> 51:08.773
...throws one of her infamous
pot potlucks...

51:08.911 --> 51:12.412
...and I find myself sozzled in
the boathouse with your Aunt Francie.

51:12.581 --> 51:15.047
Now today, some might consider her
to be zaftig...

51:15.184 --> 51:18.185
...but back then,
she could really hang a sundress.

51:18.320 --> 51:21.218
How I yearned for her.

51:21.357 --> 51:24.221
But I refrained because
it was your mother's sister.

51:24.360 --> 51:27.429
- I get it. I fucked up.
- No. No.

51:27.563 --> 51:30.860
The point is, is that two days later,
I banged the shit out of her...

51:31.000 --> 51:34.763
...in the back of a Bonneville while
your mother filled my prescription.

51:36.305 --> 51:38.032
Best Pontiac sex I've ever had.

51:40.009 --> 51:41.974
Okay, so you approve?

51:44.046 --> 51:48.412
Guilt is just one more thing
trying to asphyxiate us during sex.

51:48.551 --> 51:52.052
You cheat, you feel bad, you watch TV,
you feel better, you cheat again.

52:01.564 --> 52:03.791
All right, you know what?
This girl's different.

52:03.933 --> 52:08.094
She's smart, she's cool,
she's tough, she's a 10.

52:09.371 --> 52:13.430
Ms. Barber, I must apologize
for my son's antiquated phraseology.

52:13.576 --> 52:15.974
Out of desperation,
he continues to assess women...

52:16.145 --> 52:17.473
...a base-10 value number...

52:17.646 --> 52:19.976
...predicated solely
on their physical countenance.

52:20.149 --> 52:21.716
That's...

52:22.384 --> 52:24.918
- That's wrong, Sherman.
- No problem.

52:33.404 --> 52:36.837
I moved from numbers a long time ago.
You rarely find a 10 outside of L.A.

52:36.974 --> 52:40.134
That's ass-up polyurethane. Really
talking about a one through nine.

52:40.278 --> 52:43.643
It was too constricting.
I'm all about the letters now.

52:44.181 --> 52:45.543
J.

52:47.518 --> 52:49.108
She smells like a J.

52:49.269 --> 52:50.270
But that cougar over there,

52:51.006 --> 52:52.869
- She's a solid L.
- Okay, wait a second.

52:53.008 --> 52:55.167
That woman is 62,
that wrap is a shawl...

52:55.310 --> 52:58.004
...that L is a Y, and
there's a reason they call them Y's.

52:58.180 --> 52:59.907
- Come on.
- Check it.

53:00.449 --> 53:03.416
No, good call, Sherm, good call.

53:03.585 --> 53:05.585
I've gotta get that Lasik.

53:05.721 --> 53:09.270
- So you gonna wing me or what?
- What's the game plan?

53:09.271 --> 53:11.965
Being an educator,
I like to stick to the school grades...

53:12.108 --> 53:14.699
...A, B, C and D.
You, on the other hand...

53:14.844 --> 53:17.344
...should stay with the back 13,
thin out the herd.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.548
Thanks, Dad.
I'm off the market right now.

53:19.682 --> 53:22.273
I told you about this girl.
You know, she...

53:22.418 --> 53:24.179
The other night, we're making love...

53:24.320 --> 53:26.820
...and we're just
laying there afterwards and...

53:26.956 --> 53:29.490
- Sharing the silence?
- Yeah.

53:29.625 --> 53:32.055
What the fuck is wrong with you?

53:32.128 --> 53:34.421
"Making love"?
What are you, Nora Ephron?

53:34.563 --> 53:36.096
<i>Is this some Redbook interview?</i>

53:36.265 --> 53:38.765
You sound like Liberace's
stylist's boyfriend.

53:38.901 --> 53:41.799
"Let's just enjoy the silences
and the caprice together."

53:41.937 --> 53:44.801
- I have no son. I have no son.
- Dad, I dig this girl.

53:44.940 --> 53:47.031
Good, keep talking.
And while you're talking...

53:47.176 --> 53:49.642
...there are cougars on my right
who are clocking us.

53:49.778 --> 53:52.346
- Can you listen?
- Soon as you put on your safari hat...

53:52.481 --> 53:56.073
...and grab your gun.
- Dad, can you just stay here with me?

53:56.518 --> 53:57.585
Of course I can, son.

53:57.719 --> 54:01.050
Since you fucked my chances with
the "Dad" play. Thanks for projecting.

54:01.190 --> 54:04.157
Not to mention the gay-caress
maneuver for the hearing-impaired.

54:04.326 --> 54:06.792
Can't you just be my Dad
for five fucking seconds?

54:06.929 --> 54:11.125
Oh, I'm sorry, you want the real
father-son bullshit. Right this way.

54:11.266 --> 54:14.529
That girl was dating Dusty,
which means she's out of your league.

54:14.837 --> 54:16.234
She was slumming it, Sherman.

54:17.873 --> 54:21.465
"Now, the truth may set you free,
but first it's gonna piss you off."

54:21.610 --> 54:23.177
Gloria Steinem said that.

54:29.384 --> 54:31.679
My son, the booty call.

54:32.354 --> 54:36.716
Thanks for the advice, professor.

54:44.133 --> 54:45.825
Shit.

55:02.451 --> 55:04.576
That was insane.

55:09.625 --> 55:11.522
It was insane, right?

55:16.098 --> 55:17.187
It was...

55:22.052 --> 55:24.620
I gotta work tomorrow.

55:25.522 --> 55:27.886
Everybody's gotta work tomorrow.

55:33.130 --> 55:36.097
You don't want me to stay tonight.

55:37.501 --> 55:40.695
- I just sort of feel like it's...
- Yeah.

55:42.706 --> 55:44.831
Totally understandable.

55:45.676 --> 55:46.936
Yeah.

57:26.744 --> 57:28.641
Hi.

57:29.012 --> 57:31.205
What happened to 8?

57:31.348 --> 57:34.611
- Eight's good.
- But you're an hour late.

57:35.085 --> 57:36.550
Can we make it 9?

57:36.687 --> 57:38.982
I thought you wanted
to get drinks before dinner.

57:39.123 --> 57:42.522
I did. And I did.

57:42.693 --> 57:44.886
Well, I'm not getting in a car
with you.

57:45.062 --> 57:48.188
Like I tell my students,
even one drink is one drink too many.

57:48.365 --> 57:52.367
No vehicle necessary, teach.
The place we're going is right here.

57:52.536 --> 57:54.467
It's good. Let's go.

58:08.018 --> 58:10.348
This is wrong.

58:11.388 --> 58:12.921
Let's eat.

58:13.056 --> 58:14.623
Right there.

58:18.495 --> 58:19.495
I'm starving.

58:21.972 --> 58:25.041
Welcome to Cheesus Crust,
where pizza is a religious experience.

58:25.175 --> 58:27.038
How can I ordain your order?

58:27.177 --> 58:30.144
How is the Pizza of Nazareth?

58:30.280 --> 58:32.314
People worship it.

58:34.417 --> 58:37.111
- I'm deeply offended.
- Me too.

58:37.254 --> 58:38.582
These prices are outrageous.

58:38.722 --> 58:40.949
Which is why I carry
my Flavor Savior card.

58:41.091 --> 58:45.287
Fifteen percent off,
all who eat here religiously.

58:46.596 --> 58:48.721
Do you think this is funny?

58:51.868 --> 58:53.526
Good night.

58:54.905 --> 58:57.701
- You people are sinners!
- You should have thought of that...

58:57.841 --> 59:01.274
...19 years ago before you stopped
my mom from going into that clinic.

59:01.411 --> 59:03.206
Have a blessed day.

59:06.316 --> 59:08.111
Fastest ever.

59:32.108 --> 59:34.335
Even Jesus had to eat.

59:35.045 --> 59:38.171
- Don't.
- It was a bad date.

59:38.815 --> 59:42.043
Well, it was supposed to be
a nice night out.

59:42.185 --> 59:44.913
You know, my last boyfriend
never took me anywhere.

59:45.055 --> 59:46.622
Ever.

59:46.756 --> 59:49.586
He'd text me late at night
to come hang out at his place...

59:49.759 --> 59:53.056
...like he was ashamed
to be seen with me in public.

59:53.230 --> 59:57.061
- Please don't cry. Wait. Please?
- I'd make excuses for him, you know?

59:57.200 --> 59:59.268
He's not using me, I'm using him.

59:59.436 --> 01:00:03.563
- And I'm in total control...
- Total control and it's not that serious.

01:00:03.707 --> 01:00:05.434
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:00:05.575 --> 01:00:06.869
But when that phone rang...

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:09.510
...my heart leapt, and I was there.
- Totally.

01:00:09.646 --> 01:00:13.512
And now I finally get the chance to
go out on a real date and it's with you.

01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:17.709
- I know, that sucks.
- No, you suck.

01:00:17.854 --> 01:00:21.287
I do. I do suck.

01:00:21.424 --> 01:00:23.253
I suck.

01:00:27.397 --> 01:00:30.330
You must be hungry. Let's go eat.

01:00:32.702 --> 01:00:38.502
My senior year, I take this girl
on a date... Horrible, date from hell.

01:00:38.642 --> 01:00:41.711
About a week later, this frat boy
comes up and he says to me:

01:00:41.845 --> 01:00:44.436
"Only you could make me look good."

01:00:45.882 --> 01:00:47.847
All right? I laughed...

01:00:47.984 --> 01:00:52.043
...until one of his buddies
then came to me and was like:

01:00:52.188 --> 01:00:54.415
"Can you help me with my ex?"

01:00:54.557 --> 01:00:57.717
- Tank was born.
- Yeah. Yeah, really.

01:01:01.665 --> 01:01:05.064
- I'm sorry.
- I understand.

01:01:06.303 --> 01:01:07.734
But...

01:01:08.104 --> 01:01:09.364
...do you enjoy it?

01:01:09.506 --> 01:01:11.836
I'm good at it.
I'm good at being an asshole.

01:01:12.609 --> 01:01:14.336
It's what I do.

01:01:14.844 --> 01:01:17.742
- You're like the anti-Cupid.
- More like the Antichrist.

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:21.583
Sorry.

01:01:21.718 --> 01:01:25.015
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

01:01:25.855 --> 01:01:29.015
You know, in a cruel, twisted way...

01:01:29.192 --> 01:01:31.817
...you give couples a second chance.

01:01:31.995 --> 01:01:33.528
You're a closet romantic.

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:37.128
- I don't know about that.
- You are.

01:01:37.701 --> 01:01:39.928
You know you have to
confront this girl, Alexis.

01:01:40.603 --> 01:01:42.170
I can't.

01:01:43.606 --> 01:01:44.695
I can't.

01:01:44.841 --> 01:01:47.637
If you don't do this,
she will never take you seriously.

01:01:47.777 --> 01:01:50.778
You need to march up there
and tell her how you feel.

01:01:51.414 --> 01:01:53.106
Alexis.

01:01:55.218 --> 01:01:57.513
Alexis, it's Tank.

01:01:57.854 --> 01:01:59.319
Yeah.

01:02:02.525 --> 01:02:04.525
I'm just gonna say this.
I'm gonna say it.

01:02:04.661 --> 01:02:08.128
If you value this, us, we...

01:02:08.264 --> 01:02:12.164
...then you will let me take you
on a proper date.

01:02:12.302 --> 01:02:14.165
- In public.
- It's 2 a.m. in the morning.

01:02:14.304 --> 01:02:16.167
Can we do the proper date
another time?

01:02:19.876 --> 01:02:21.375
- Tomorrow.
- Yes.

01:02:21.511 --> 01:02:23.101
Proper date. In public.

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.769
- Get some...
- Good night.

01:02:24.914 --> 01:02:27.175
- Good night.
- Nice shirt.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:45.799
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

01:02:49.406 --> 01:02:51.565
This is for you.
Have to have a corsage.

01:02:51.708 --> 01:02:54.003
Oh, my God.

01:02:54.144 --> 01:02:57.543
- You gotta be kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

01:02:58.581 --> 01:03:00.740
I never went to prom.

01:03:00.884 --> 01:03:02.611
I remember.

01:03:05.321 --> 01:03:07.446
Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:03:14.364 --> 01:03:17.126
She's got a shank. You might
wanna actually focus on her.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.463
- They're with me, okay? Thanks.
- Alexis, this is Hilary, our chaperon.

01:03:20.603 --> 01:03:23.194
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

01:03:23.907 --> 01:03:24.974
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:03:26.443 --> 01:03:27.805
You two kids have fun.

01:03:32.649 --> 01:03:34.717
I'm having fun.

01:03:34.851 --> 01:03:38.682
Let's set the stage here.
You're 17 years old.

01:03:38.822 --> 01:03:41.720
As you make the mistake of
heading out onto the dance floor...

01:03:41.858 --> 01:03:44.017
...a fine, young chap
stops you on your way...

01:03:44.194 --> 01:03:46.990
Strikingly handsome. Some
would say ruggedly good-looking.

01:03:47.163 --> 01:03:50.164
He stops you and says, "Excuse me,
would you care to dance?"

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.301
- Don't tell me you dance.
- Me?

01:03:53.436 --> 01:03:54.560
Never.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.667
Oh, my God.

01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:03.443
- Oh, my God.
- That's it. That's all I've got, really.

01:04:09.185 --> 01:04:10.411
No way.

01:04:15.625 --> 01:04:16.714
For you.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.487
- Let's go.
- No, I can't...

01:04:19.662 --> 01:04:23.493
You're making this embarrassing-
myself-to-be-cute thing really difficult.

01:04:23.633 --> 01:04:25.132
Look at this, check it out.

01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:31.231
- Did you see that little move?
- I saw it. I wanna see more over here.

01:04:58.001 --> 01:04:59.125
I got caught up.

01:05:23.593 --> 01:05:25.786
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:05:50.119 --> 01:05:51.550
Hey.

01:05:55.792 --> 01:05:57.382
Fun, huh?

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:58.957
Yeah.

01:06:02.966 --> 01:06:05.500
You know you could have
any girl out there, right?

01:06:06.502 --> 01:06:09.594
Hey, dude, look at me.

01:06:09.739 --> 01:06:11.033
Look at this.

01:06:11.174 --> 01:06:13.139
It's not about
what you look like, man.

01:06:13.276 --> 01:06:14.434
It's right here, okay?

01:06:14.577 --> 01:06:17.976
It's attitude, it's how you look at them.
Pretend you don't give a shit...

01:06:18.114 --> 01:06:21.650
...they will be on you like acne.
Guaranteed or your money back.

01:06:22.652 --> 01:06:27.189
So, then, like, why have you been
such a kiss-ass to your girl all night?

01:06:27.323 --> 01:06:29.414
Pulling out chairs,
throwing out compliments.

01:06:29.559 --> 01:06:33.925
I'm on a different plan. You're on a...
What you... What l...

01:06:34.097 --> 01:06:36.563
"Can I wipe your ass, baby?"

01:06:36.866 --> 01:06:40.265
I was trying to help you, but fuck you.

01:06:40.403 --> 01:06:41.731
Fuck you, you hypocrite.

01:06:41.871 --> 01:06:44.531
"Hey nerd, let me give you
some condescending advice."

01:06:44.674 --> 01:06:45.832
Be cruel to women?

01:06:45.975 --> 01:06:47.702
Fat, pathetic, sad dork.

01:06:47.844 --> 01:06:50.913
- Old man at a high-school prom.
- Husky bitch.

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:56.783
Don't get ahead of yourself here.
And I'm just curious...

01:06:56.919 --> 01:06:59.317
...but are you seeing anybody?
- No.

01:06:59.455 --> 01:07:01.250
No?

01:07:01.357 --> 01:07:03.516
- Are you?
- No.

01:07:03.726 --> 01:07:06.226
What about that awkward night
with that guy?

01:07:06.362 --> 01:07:07.588
You still calling him?

01:07:07.997 --> 01:07:10.258
He kind of disappeared.

01:07:10.733 --> 01:07:12.596
I haven't heard from him since he quit.

01:07:12.735 --> 01:07:15.235
Maybe you could call him. You know?

01:07:15.371 --> 01:07:17.962
See how he's holding up kind of thing.

01:07:18.341 --> 01:07:20.671
- What?
- Or don't.

01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:23.470
It's... It's your choice.
I mean, I'm just saying...

01:07:23.613 --> 01:07:26.739
- No, I know. It's sweet.
- Polite.

01:07:27.817 --> 01:07:31.683
Even if it is a part of your whole show
that you've got going on tonight.

01:07:31.921 --> 01:07:34.615
You're pulling out all the stops.

01:07:35.091 --> 01:07:37.989
Sweet Tank.
Sweet Tank is way into me.

01:07:42.365 --> 01:07:45.093
You know what, though?
You're right. I should call him.

01:07:47.336 --> 01:07:49.336
I should call him.

01:07:52.054 --> 01:07:54.884
You know, it was really cool
of you to call, Alexis.

01:07:55.023 --> 01:07:58.092
Lunch, wedding errands.
Just like old times, huh?

01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:01.329
I haven't seen you since I took
my leave of absence from work.

01:08:01.497 --> 01:08:03.030
Yeah, I heard you quit.

01:08:03.198 --> 01:08:06.790
Oh, no, no, no, I just...
I took a sabbatical. A sabbatical.

01:08:06.935 --> 01:08:08.935
I just wanted to do
some soul-searching.

01:08:16.645 --> 01:08:19.612
- My sister picked it out.
- Well, you should thank her.

01:08:19.747 --> 01:08:22.715
- The whole world should thank her.
- Well, you're welcome.

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.350
- Speaking of the devil.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:08:25.487 --> 01:08:27.520
I love it. I love it so much.

01:08:27.656 --> 01:08:29.747
This is my friend, Dustin.
This is my sister.

01:08:29.892 --> 01:08:31.118
- Oh, hi.
- No. Get over here.

01:08:31.292 --> 01:08:33.122
- What?
- Congratulations.

01:08:33.295 --> 01:08:35.590
Alexis will not shut up about you,
the wedding...

01:08:35.731 --> 01:08:38.197
That was really smart.
That was so smart, yeah.

01:08:38.332 --> 01:08:40.492
See, I brought mine too. Hi.

01:08:40.636 --> 01:08:45.002
It's really the only opinion
that means anything these days.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.298
Oh, my gosh.

01:08:47.009 --> 01:08:49.304
You have to see my dress.
Great, now.

01:08:52.481 --> 01:08:54.446
- Yeah, I did it when...
- Alexis, I'm sorry.

01:08:54.582 --> 01:08:57.345
I'm the...
I'm the dress-shopping gay pal?

01:08:57.486 --> 01:09:00.145
I just think that now's
not the time to set her straight.

01:09:00.288 --> 01:09:01.947
She's a little crazy, she's manic.

01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:04.522
I get that we're in slow-down mode...

01:09:04.693 --> 01:09:06.886
...but I'm not gonna, like,
meet your parents...

01:09:07.062 --> 01:09:10.563
...under the pretext of the gay friend.
I mean, that's ridic...

01:09:11.341 --> 01:09:13.103
- Dustin, you need to...
- What? What?

01:09:13.144 --> 01:09:16.042
Yeah, what? What is it? What?
Is something wrong?

01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:17.180
Do you not want me to come?

01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:19.075
Promise me you won't be upset...

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.444
...if I tell you something.
- Yeah, what?

01:09:21.883 --> 01:09:23.883
I'm seeing somebody.

01:09:24.018 --> 01:09:28.452
And so I asked him
to come with me to the wedding.

01:09:30.858 --> 01:09:32.550
- You're... You're upset.
- No. What?

01:09:33.428 --> 01:09:35.758
Upset? No. Why would I be upset?

01:09:35.997 --> 01:09:38.122
Come on. That's crazy.

01:09:38.265 --> 01:09:41.767
Like I'm a guy that gets upset.
Come on. More like happy.

01:09:41.903 --> 01:09:44.301
You know? I'm happy that...
That, you know.

01:09:44.439 --> 01:09:47.702
- That you found someone special.
- It still feels a little short.

01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:49.636
I still think that if you put the...

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:51.640
- So, dish.
- I just wanna make sure my...

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:53.573
Who is he?

01:09:53.747 --> 01:09:57.750
Yeah, I think that's too much shoe.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.656
Man-ischewitz, Sherman,
look at you.

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:05.120
You remind me of me
on my wedding day.

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.591
I was one nasty son of a bitch.

01:10:09.797 --> 01:10:12.866
- Dad, why did Mom marry you?
- Who makes this tux? Versace?

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:15.661
- Pop, come on. Fess up. Dad.
- Where'd you get this tux?

01:10:15.803 --> 01:10:18.770
- The black on black.
- Come on, Dad, really.

01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:22.939
Your mother was
an incredible woman...

01:10:23.111 --> 01:10:26.942
...but she had awful judgment.

01:10:27.081 --> 01:10:29.615
She was always trying to
find the better man inside me.

01:10:29.784 --> 01:10:34.048
Unfortunately, she found him
inside of her psychotherapist, Janine.

01:10:34.455 --> 01:10:35.522
Not good.

01:10:35.657 --> 01:10:39.591
See, I always knew that your mom was
the best it was ever gonna get for me.

01:10:39.727 --> 01:10:42.819
And I never asked the more
important question, which is:

01:10:42.964 --> 01:10:45.157
Was I the best it was
ever gonna get for her?

01:10:49.671 --> 01:10:51.363
You're not so bad, Pop.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:57.945
I'm a fraud, Sherman. Yeah.

01:10:58.079 --> 01:11:00.443
And I'm a selfish asshole.

01:11:06.921 --> 01:11:08.921
And so are you.

01:11:09.791 --> 01:11:12.121
So I want you to get out there...

01:11:13.494 --> 01:11:15.892
...and I want you to revel in it.

01:11:36.984 --> 01:11:38.949
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.

01:11:39.087 --> 01:11:41.178
- You are hot as a pistol.
- You look handsome.

01:11:41.322 --> 01:11:44.323
- No, you. I am very...
- I am so impressed with you.

01:11:44.459 --> 01:11:46.754
...impressed. You look beautiful.

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:50.228
- Do you like the red lipstick?
- I wanna do you right here.

01:11:50.365 --> 01:11:52.490
Okay, I gotta go... Josh.

01:11:52.633 --> 01:11:56.225
My future brother-in-law. Josh,
I want you to meet my boyfriend, Tank.

01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:58.200
Hey, Josh. I'll be your groom...

01:11:58.339 --> 01:12:01.033
<i>...in today's performance of
Fuck Me, I'm Getting Married.</i>

01:12:01.175 --> 01:12:04.142
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
tame Bridezilla.

01:12:04.312 --> 01:12:07.540
- You want me to come? Lex?
- No, I'll look out for him. All right?

01:12:07.715 --> 01:12:10.283
- Just breathe for a second, all right?
- I am breathing.

01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:11.711
Now adapt.

01:12:11.853 --> 01:12:13.284
- Are we adapting?
- Yeah.

01:12:13.421 --> 01:12:15.250
Are we ready to evolve?

01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:18.152
You let fly one word
about our arrangement...

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:20.417
...I will crush your nuts into butter.

01:12:20.561 --> 01:12:23.528
Like the kind at the health-food store,
but not so good for you.

01:12:23.664 --> 01:12:25.959
But... But, but...

01:12:26.334 --> 01:12:29.835
...you play ball, I will plant your flag
right next to mine. All right?

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:32.699
I will make you family.
And believe me, Tank...

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.238
...you wanna be family.

01:12:36.277 --> 01:12:38.242
- Money.
- Jesus Christ.

01:12:38.379 --> 01:12:40.743
Like, "money" money.

01:12:40.882 --> 01:12:43.416
Old money, new money,
fuck-me money, fuck-you money.

01:12:43.551 --> 01:12:44.982
Family money, money.

01:12:45.119 --> 01:12:48.279
Okay, yeah.
Josh, you got me all wrong.

01:12:48.423 --> 01:12:51.686
No. I know exactly
who you are, all right?

01:12:51.826 --> 01:12:54.690
It's Alexis who's got you all wrong.

01:12:54.829 --> 01:12:57.489
Let's do what we do, brother.
Hey, Merrilee.

01:12:58.132 --> 01:13:00.496
- Brian.
- Now, I've told you, fella...

01:13:00.635 --> 01:13:02.862
...from here on out,
it's strictly Mom and Dad.

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:05.937
I'd like to introduce you to
your next son-in-law, Tank Turner.

01:13:06.073 --> 01:13:07.800
This is Alexis' guy.

01:13:07.942 --> 01:13:11.239
- I've heard so much about you.
- That is unfortunate.

01:13:11.412 --> 01:13:13.207
Forget it all.

01:13:13.381 --> 01:13:15.073
- Tank.
- Hi.

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:21.910
Tank Turner is an asshole.

01:13:22.423 --> 01:13:25.492
- You brought Satan to my wedding?
- Well, he's changed.

01:13:25.626 --> 01:13:27.785
Or he's going to change.
Or he's changing.

01:13:27.929 --> 01:13:29.155
No.

01:13:29.297 --> 01:13:31.888
I'm sorry, but that is not enough.

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:34.829
Okay, maybe he's this fun vacation
on the dark side...

01:13:34.969 --> 01:13:37.560
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel,
I'm falling in love with him.

01:13:37.972 --> 01:13:39.403
What?

01:13:40.441 --> 01:13:42.099
I love him.

01:13:51.853 --> 01:13:54.319
- Hey, so...
- So many things that I want...

01:13:54.455 --> 01:13:56.284
Oh, come here.

01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:06.063
- I gotta go. I'm going. I'm leaving.
- Go.

01:14:26.654 --> 01:14:29.518
Are you the best
it's ever gonna get for her?

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.191
Are you?

01:15:57.178 --> 01:16:00.679
If anyone here can show just cause
why these two should not be joined...

01:16:00.848 --> 01:16:05.976
...let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

01:16:05.987 --> 01:16:07.416
White dress.

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:10.053
Chick's seen more dick than this guy.

01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:18.644
I've been wanting to come over here
because I was reminded of a joke.

01:16:19.255 --> 01:16:22.586
A priest and a Rabbi are at a wedding.
Who knew?

01:16:23.059 --> 01:16:27.118
And they see a small boy
bending over to tie his shoe.

01:16:27.296 --> 01:16:29.523
So the priest says to the Rabbi:

01:16:29.699 --> 01:16:31.858
"God, I'd really love to screw that kid."

01:16:32.034 --> 01:16:35.695
And then the Rabbi says,
"Out of what?"

01:16:37.573 --> 01:16:40.540
It's a visual thing,
because the kid is basically like this.

01:16:40.676 --> 01:16:41.902
He's bending over.

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:44.575
Dirty Houdini. You gotta try this.

01:16:45.415 --> 01:16:49.076
While you're giving it
to your lady from behind, okay?

01:16:49.219 --> 01:16:51.082
Very important.
You gotta be behind her.

01:16:51.221 --> 01:16:53.585
Start making some sounds
like you're gonna bust...

01:16:53.723 --> 01:16:54.949
...then you pull out.

01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:58.388
As you pull out, you let a little dribble
of saliva trickle down...

01:16:58.561 --> 01:17:01.687
...onto the small of her back.
She thinks it's over, she flips over:

01:17:01.865 --> 01:17:03.296
"Good, I can go to sleep."

01:17:03.433 --> 01:17:05.763
Fireman's hose. All over.

01:17:10.773 --> 01:17:12.773
- I don't get it.
- You don't get it?

01:17:12.909 --> 01:17:16.035
Here's what you're gonna do.
Go ask your mom. Right there. Pound.

01:17:22.418 --> 01:17:23.678
Ready, and wow.

01:17:25.021 --> 01:17:27.055
It's like lifting a coffin.

01:17:28.391 --> 01:17:31.085
Oh, Nana. You have a lead vagina.

01:17:35.798 --> 01:17:37.729
Hello? Yeah, I can talk.

01:17:43.105 --> 01:17:45.332
- You weren't gonna drink.
- Can't have a glass...

01:17:45.475 --> 01:17:47.133
...to celebrate the holy sacrament?

01:17:47.276 --> 01:17:49.469
- Is that Jägermeister I smell?
- I don't know.

01:17:49.612 --> 01:17:51.475
Wine, huh?

01:17:53.316 --> 01:17:54.974
- No.
- Don't get into any trouble.

01:17:55.117 --> 01:17:57.845
- I'm don't-ing. I'm don't-ing.
- Don't get into any trouble.

01:18:06.596 --> 01:18:08.960
For their first dance
as a married couple...

01:18:09.098 --> 01:18:13.692
...l'd like to present to you
Rachel and Josh.

01:18:26.048 --> 01:18:27.206
Sorry.

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:29.981
Can I have this dance?

01:18:30.119 --> 01:18:31.447
Not a good time? Okay.

01:18:31.587 --> 01:18:36.147
Sorry, everybody. This is their night.
I'll clean that up. It's the chicken.

01:18:37.093 --> 01:18:39.058
The bride and groom.

01:18:45.234 --> 01:18:48.235
I'm gonna grab these. Clean.
I washed them after I threw up.

01:18:48.371 --> 01:18:50.001
How are you?

01:18:50.795 --> 01:18:52.795
It's okay, I got the sleeve. I caught it.

01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:55.498
Usually they come in twos
and threes, so that's...

01:18:58.102 --> 01:19:00.670
Cocaine, you know,
just kind of gets me sneezy.

01:19:00.805 --> 01:19:03.931
And you, by the way, look lovely.
I just wanted to...

01:19:04.075 --> 01:19:06.769
...say a hello to you.

01:19:11.048 --> 01:19:12.638
All right.

01:19:17.321 --> 01:19:19.855
Weddings get me hot and hard,
know what I'm saying?

01:19:19.991 --> 01:19:21.718
What do you got going on?

01:19:21.859 --> 01:19:24.427
I want that in my fucking mouth.

01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:29.010
Hey. Hey, Alexis sent me
to look for you, so let's go.

01:19:29.026 --> 01:19:30.860
...Having a little chat.

01:19:30.895 --> 01:19:34.396
With my friend.
Taking a breather. Breathing.

01:19:36.267 --> 01:19:39.063
Fucking goddamn it.
What do you call that shit, A. J?

01:19:39.203 --> 01:19:41.828
Afghani-Kush Kryptonite.

01:19:41.973 --> 01:19:45.406
Kryptonite. It killed Superman.
I'm just a man.

01:19:45.543 --> 01:19:48.874
You really are, like, a super
special kind of asshole, aren't you?

01:19:49.013 --> 01:19:51.013
I ride the special-kind-of-asshole bus.

01:19:51.148 --> 01:19:53.341
- Do you really?
- All right. Okay.

01:19:54.051 --> 01:19:56.210
- One more bite.
- What are you doing?

01:19:56.354 --> 01:19:58.945
Alexis is gonna freak out
when she sees this.

01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:00.316
- No she won't.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:02.321
- She's understanding.
- Oh, my God, dude.

01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:05.562
- She's never gonna forgive you.
- All right. I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:20:07.531 --> 01:20:09.064
- What a day.
- Yeah.

01:20:10.434 --> 01:20:12.900
May I partake?

01:20:13.404 --> 01:20:16.496
My daughter got married today.

01:20:16.641 --> 01:20:20.199
- Wonderful.
- Oh, God, I feel old.

01:20:20.344 --> 01:20:25.882
I bet back in the day, you were
one hot slice of fuckberry pie.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.883
You bet your sweet ass I was.

01:20:34.392 --> 01:20:37.620
Hey. I love your shoes.

01:20:38.396 --> 01:20:40.464
So are we gonna do this or what?

01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:43.961
Come on, it's not gonna
suck itself, Mama.

01:20:44.969 --> 01:20:47.094
Oh, my God.

01:20:47.238 --> 01:20:49.499
Who is this guy?

01:20:51.208 --> 01:20:53.708
And he's ruining my entire wedding.

01:20:53.844 --> 01:20:57.038
He ruined my dance,
my actual dance.

01:20:57.181 --> 01:21:00.546
No, it's ruined.
And... Why did you bring him here?

01:21:00.685 --> 01:21:02.548
It's disgusting.

01:21:04.355 --> 01:21:07.913
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:21:08.059 --> 01:21:11.026
- Are you kidding me?
- He really?

01:21:13.698 --> 01:21:16.562
I got a bass-ackward way of
showing it, but I care about you.

01:21:16.701 --> 01:21:19.531
Tank. Tank! How could you?!

01:21:20.037 --> 01:21:22.799
My ex, Sarah. Cunt.

01:21:24.342 --> 01:21:26.569
Oh, no. You're not gonna
walk away from me.

01:21:26.711 --> 01:21:28.608
You're gonna talk to me.
This is insane.

01:21:28.746 --> 01:21:30.905
Who is that person, huh?
Who is that guy?

01:21:31.048 --> 01:21:33.673
This is me. I'm an asshole.

01:21:33.818 --> 01:21:36.580
You had your chance with a good guy
and you threw it away.

01:21:36.721 --> 01:21:38.083
- Who?
- Dustin.

01:21:38.222 --> 01:21:41.348
- You have no right to tell me...
- No, Dustin. Dustin's here.

01:21:41.492 --> 01:21:43.560
Dustin. Dustin?

01:21:43.728 --> 01:21:44.920
- Dustin?
- Be careful.

01:21:45.096 --> 01:21:46.959
Tank!

01:21:57.074 --> 01:21:58.732
It's time you all knew the truth.

01:21:58.876 --> 01:22:01.877
Would you stop? If I go down,
you're coming with me, okay?

01:22:02.012 --> 01:22:06.242
Okay? So I'm sure every...

01:22:07.051 --> 01:22:08.118
Don't touch.

01:22:08.128 --> 01:22:10.025
Okay? Why don't you
take a walk with me?

01:22:10.063 --> 01:22:12.030
- Hey! Come with me, okay?
- Dustin.

01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:14.791
Would you guys like to know
what this man...? Excuse me.

01:22:14.936 --> 01:22:16.334
What this man does as a hobby?

01:22:16.476 --> 01:22:20.137
Let's say, for example...

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:23.747
...I get dumped by my girl.

01:22:23.883 --> 01:22:28.317
And I want to pay him
to go out with her...

01:22:28.455 --> 01:22:30.819
- Oh, boy.
...terrorize her...

01:22:30.991 --> 01:22:35.027
...and have her come screaming back
into my arms.

01:22:36.048 --> 01:22:38.910
...and so I made a deal
with the devil.

01:22:38.953 --> 01:22:39.853
That's what I did.

01:22:39.926 --> 01:22:43.325
- But... But what does that make him?
- Okay, stop. Stop it.

01:22:43.463 --> 01:22:46.259
Just tell me this isn't true.

01:22:48.801 --> 01:22:50.766
Ask him.

01:22:51.771 --> 01:22:53.304
- Baby, sorry.
- You make me sick.

01:22:53.439 --> 01:22:56.633
- Ask him.
- I hate you.

01:22:58.010 --> 01:22:59.805
- Ask him.
- I'm gonna kill you!

01:22:59.946 --> 01:23:01.877
I'm gonna kill you!

01:23:02.014 --> 01:23:04.480
- I work on referrals.
- Okay.

01:23:05.685 --> 01:23:08.345
You're honestly gonna tell me...

01:23:09.388 --> 01:23:13.390
...that you and I, that's nothing?

01:23:13.826 --> 01:23:15.621
That's nothing?

01:23:17.563 --> 01:23:19.927
I'm just a job?

01:23:20.833 --> 01:23:25.097
I need you to tell me.
Tank, tell me right now...

01:23:25.238 --> 01:23:27.329
...that I'm just a job.

01:23:27.473 --> 01:23:31.339
- Tell me to my face.
- You're just a job.

01:23:36.382 --> 01:23:38.347
Just a job.

01:23:38.484 --> 01:23:41.348
I never wanna see you again.

01:23:42.288 --> 01:23:43.946
Yeah.

01:23:44.090 --> 01:23:46.454
Alexis. Alexis.

01:23:46.626 --> 01:23:48.626
I'm gonna kill you!

01:24:18.424 --> 01:24:20.424
Motherfucker.

01:24:41.314 --> 01:24:44.042
<i>You have one new message.</i>

01:24:44.951 --> 01:24:46.985
<i>Dust, you were right.</i>

01:24:47.119 --> 01:24:49.278
<i>Alexis is an angel...</i>

01:24:49.422 --> 01:24:52.355
<i>... and she deserves the best.</i>

01:24:53.893 --> 01:24:56.120
<i>And that's you.
So I'm sorry it took so long...</i>

01:24:56.295 --> 01:24:58.955
<i>... but I finally did
what you hired me to do.</i>

01:24:59.098 --> 01:25:01.928
<i>I got a bass-ackward way of
showing it, but I care about you.</i>

01:25:02.068 --> 01:25:05.137
<i>Tank. Tank! How could you?!</i>

01:25:05.271 --> 01:25:07.896
<i>My ex, Sarah. Cunt.</i>

01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:42.632
Did you love her?

01:25:42.775 --> 01:25:45.366
Do you love her?
That's all I wanna know.

01:25:46.779 --> 01:25:49.040
I don't even know what that means.

01:25:49.181 --> 01:25:52.273
Yeah. Well, apparently, neither do I.

01:25:52.551 --> 01:25:55.279
All I know is that me and her
ends up with her hurt.

01:25:55.421 --> 01:25:56.886
It's inevitable.

01:25:57.023 --> 01:25:59.648
Turners and women, right, Pop?

01:25:59.825 --> 01:26:01.222
Yeah.

01:26:03.296 --> 01:26:05.660
I banged a lot of women, Sherman.

01:26:06.299 --> 01:26:08.299
I've been banging
since back in the day...

01:26:08.434 --> 01:26:11.059
...when you were
laminating pictures of them.

01:26:11.203 --> 01:26:13.396
So, yeah, that's me.

01:26:13.939 --> 01:26:17.008
That's this guy, but that ain't you.
No.

01:26:17.143 --> 01:26:20.644
Last night, you proved something
that I have long feared.

01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:22.438
And that is...

01:26:22.581 --> 01:26:24.842
...you may just
take after your mother.

01:26:26.619 --> 01:26:30.450
Yeah, I can't believe you actually
tried to give Alexis up for me.

01:26:30.956 --> 01:26:32.182
I know, dude.

01:26:32.358 --> 01:26:34.323
- That's pretty fucked up, right?
- Yeah.

01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.585
I mean, if that's not love...

01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:39.364
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

01:26:39.799 --> 01:26:42.959
I'm sorry. I'm the guy who...

01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:46.470
You were my best friend.

01:26:47.039 --> 01:26:48.766
I still am.

01:26:50.476 --> 01:26:52.635
You guys gonna make out now, huh?

01:26:52.778 --> 01:26:55.745
Go ahead, stick your tongue
in his mouth. That'll clear the air.

01:26:58.651 --> 01:27:00.184
How about a?

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:11.690
Look, I know I kind of lost it for a while,
but now I'm seeing things clearly.

01:27:11.831 --> 01:27:13.865
You need to get her back.

01:27:15.901 --> 01:27:17.992
- But I don't deserve her.
- No, you... Tank.

01:27:18.137 --> 01:27:20.705
If you were willing to give her up,
you deserve her.

01:27:20.973 --> 01:27:23.507
That's fucked up, but you're right.

01:27:25.911 --> 01:27:28.206
She's my angel
and it's time she knew.

01:27:28.347 --> 01:27:30.312
Yes. So, what's stopping you?

01:27:30.383 --> 01:27:32.348
I propositioned her mother
for a blowjob.

01:27:33.686 --> 01:27:36.380
Man, that is great.

01:27:36.522 --> 01:27:39.090
That is so great. Yes.

01:27:39.892 --> 01:27:42.790
Alexis! Alexis, wait.

01:27:42.928 --> 01:27:44.461
Alexis.

01:27:44.597 --> 01:27:46.460
Just hear me out, all right? Listen.

01:27:46.599 --> 01:27:49.429
Nope. Nope. Nope.

01:27:49.568 --> 01:27:50.999
I did it for you.

01:27:51.137 --> 01:27:53.797
I pushed you away because
I thought I didn't deserve you.

01:27:53.939 --> 01:27:57.440
- You don't.
- So I made a mistake.

01:27:57.576 --> 01:28:00.201
- Many.
- I know.

01:28:00.346 --> 01:28:02.607
- I will never do better than you.
- I know.

01:28:02.748 --> 01:28:04.782
- I need you in my life.
- I know.

01:28:04.917 --> 01:28:07.850
- And I wanna apologize.
- I don't want it.

01:28:07.987 --> 01:28:10.521
Good, because it's not for you.

01:28:10.689 --> 01:28:13.485
I wanna apologize to myself.

01:28:13.659 --> 01:28:17.195
I'm sorry, Tank,
that you blew it with Alexis.

01:28:17.363 --> 01:28:19.761
- But you did.
- Because I thought you deserved...

01:28:19.899 --> 01:28:21.364
...someone better than me.

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:25.297
But when I'm with you,
it's like I'm better than me.

01:28:25.671 --> 01:28:29.502
You're the only person that could ever
make me do cardio. And I hate cardio.

01:28:29.642 --> 01:28:33.200
I wanna faint, I want a cigarette
and I have a massive cramp.

01:28:33.345 --> 01:28:35.709
But I would run a marathon for you.

01:28:41.287 --> 01:28:43.446
- Okay.
- Fuck me.

01:28:43.589 --> 01:28:45.657
You ruined my sister's wedding.

01:28:45.825 --> 01:28:49.088
But I saved her life.
That guy was a fucking fuckface.

01:28:49.261 --> 01:28:53.354
- You curse incessantly.
- I will never swear again.

01:28:53.532 --> 01:28:55.065
Fuck. Last one.

01:28:55.234 --> 01:28:58.667
- My parents hate you.
- Well, they'll come around.

01:28:58.804 --> 01:29:00.166
Except your mother.

01:29:00.306 --> 01:29:01.395
And your dad.

01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:04.473
- Your job is a joke.
- A joke? I sell air.

01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:06.075
I do the impossible every day.

01:29:06.212 --> 01:29:08.007
Have you ever even read a book?

01:29:08.147 --> 01:29:09.908
<i>The Giving Tree.</i>

01:29:10.249 --> 01:29:12.909
- And?
- Among others. Countless others.

01:29:13.052 --> 01:29:15.950
- Tank.
- I'll join a book club.

01:29:16.589 --> 01:29:19.385
What's the matter?
You can't keep up?

01:29:20.359 --> 01:29:23.622
You are not passionate
about anything.

01:29:23.762 --> 01:29:27.229
Except you. I'm passionate about you.
As evidence, consider the fact...

01:29:27.366 --> 01:29:29.593
...that I've been running
for two goddamn hours.

01:29:29.735 --> 01:29:32.030
- I need to stop and rest.
- You sabotage dates.

01:29:32.171 --> 01:29:34.535
You're a professional asshole.
That's what you do.

01:29:34.673 --> 01:29:37.970
No. It's what I did.

01:29:38.644 --> 01:29:41.872
Tank, I just don't think
you're the one.

01:29:44.884 --> 01:29:48.010
Not yet, but I'll get there.

01:30:00.032 --> 01:30:01.429
You okay?

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:17.541
Without air, we cannot live.

01:31:18.978 --> 01:31:21.069
I think those words resonate
with people...

01:31:21.213 --> 01:31:25.010
...because they're really true,
you know?

01:31:30.289 --> 01:31:31.720
What?

01:31:32.658 --> 01:31:34.783
I thought... I thought that was a joke.

01:31:35.227 --> 01:31:39.491
- It wasn't. What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

01:31:39.632 --> 01:31:41.063
Air?

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:44.269
Because I don't really think
there's anything funny about air.

01:31:44.403 --> 01:31:46.403
It's kind of too important.

01:31:56.782 --> 01:31:58.440
Asshole.

01:32:01.687 --> 01:32:02.754
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:32:02.888 --> 01:32:03.955
- I'm Alexis.
- Hi.

01:32:04.123 --> 01:32:06.657
Do you wanna know what
this guy did? He humiliated me.

01:32:06.792 --> 01:32:08.883
- He embarrassed me. He literally...
- Alexis.

01:32:09.061 --> 01:32:10.253
I'm having a conversation.

01:32:10.429 --> 01:32:13.828
I'm having a conversation.
It's with her, it's not with you.

01:32:14.733 --> 01:32:16.960
What this guy did to me
makes me sick every day.

01:32:17.102 --> 01:32:18.794
Physically ill.

01:32:18.937 --> 01:32:21.437
But is that like lovesickness
or like hatesickness?

01:32:21.573 --> 01:32:23.868
- No, it's like morning sickness.
- What?

01:32:25.177 --> 01:32:28.542
Yeah, I'm pregnant, okay?
So I'm sorry.

01:32:29.214 --> 01:32:31.441
It makes me a little emotional.

01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:34.914
- You're pregnant?
- Yes, I'm fucking pregnant!

01:32:35.054 --> 01:32:36.883
I probably should go.

01:32:37.022 --> 01:32:38.589
But how? It's...

01:32:39.792 --> 01:32:41.723
How do you think?

01:32:41.860 --> 01:32:43.291
That's right, everybody.

01:32:43.429 --> 01:32:47.625
This asshole got me pregnant.

01:32:48.167 --> 01:32:51.794
- I definitely think I should go.
- Okay, I didn't know. I didn't know.

01:32:51.937 --> 01:32:53.334
If you think that's bad...

01:32:53.472 --> 01:32:55.767
...you should hear what this guy
did to my sister.

01:32:55.908 --> 01:33:00.445
- Alexis, I've apologized a million times.
- He got her pregnant too.

01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.808
So there's two of us
having a baby together...

01:33:03.949 --> 01:33:07.382
...about three and a half weeks
apart.

01:33:07.519 --> 01:33:09.143
- Yeah.
- It was dark, I was drunk...

01:33:09.288 --> 01:33:10.821
...and I thought it was you.

01:33:10.956 --> 01:33:12.523
Right?

01:33:16.462 --> 01:33:19.497
I'm gonna go now.
It was nice meeting you.

01:33:19.631 --> 01:33:21.961
Yeah, nice to meet you too.

01:33:23.402 --> 01:33:24.628
What's going on here?

01:33:25.637 --> 01:33:27.932
Oh, I'm just saving another girl...

01:33:28.073 --> 01:33:30.869
...from the worst sex
she'll ever have in her life.

01:33:35.514 --> 01:33:37.980
Well, your mother never complained.

01:33:39.852 --> 01:33:43.217
You wanna know why
I didn't return your e-mails?

01:33:43.822 --> 01:33:45.412
Your pathetic calls?

01:33:46.658 --> 01:33:50.091
You are unattractive. I said it.

01:33:51.897 --> 01:33:54.124
I'm not attractive.
Well, let's put it this way.

01:33:54.266 --> 01:33:57.529
I would kick your ass right now,
but my foot might get sucked in.

01:33:59.438 --> 01:34:03.838
I'd kick your dick right now,
but my foot might get herpes.

01:34:04.543 --> 01:34:07.339
Well, you know, you can
stop trying to be clever, Alexis.

01:34:07.479 --> 01:34:11.106
The funniest thing that'll ever
come out of you is me.

01:34:11.483 --> 01:34:13.642
All right, Tank.

01:34:13.786 --> 01:34:16.218
You got the best joke here.

01:34:17.222 --> 01:34:18.983
And it's in your pants.

01:34:29.802 --> 01:34:31.836
- I hate you.
- I hate you too.

01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:33.799
Oh, baby.
