WEBVTT

00:17.351 --> 00:19.842
(walkers snarling )

00:30.865 --> 00:33.106
Hi, Daddy.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.282
- Doing okay?
- Yeah.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.200
Yes, sir.

00:45.463 --> 00:47.579
- Any trouble?
- No.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.795
- You had some.
- Yeah.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.505
A little.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.882
Carol,
I'll take that.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.775
(theme music playing )

02:40.828 --> 02:43.865
How hungry are you,
scale of one to 10?

02:44.040 --> 02:45.530
15.

02:47.043 --> 02:48.203
28.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.834
( chuckles )
Yeah.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.872
Well, it's been a while.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.665
I'm gonna go
check the snares.

02:56.761 --> 02:58.251
Can I go with you?

03:00.348 --> 03:02.179
Well, how else
are you gonna learn?

03:05.853 --> 03:08.094
Hey, you, too.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.199
Rick:
We'll stay another day or two.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.952
Get some more rest.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.283
Finish healing up?

03:27.458 --> 03:29.574
I'm almost there.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.245
We're close now, right?

03:34.423 --> 03:35.833
To Terminus?

03:36.008 --> 03:37.714
- Yeah.
- We are.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.840
When we get there,

03:43.015 --> 03:45.347
are we gonna tell them?

03:45.518 --> 03:47.224
Tell them what?

03:48.854 --> 03:51.311
Everything that's
happened to us.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.473
All the stuff we've done.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.352
Are we gonna tell them
the truth?

03:59.448 --> 04:01.188
We're gonna tell them
who we are.

04:01.367 --> 04:04.074
But how do you say that?
I mean...

04:06.247 --> 04:08.488
who are we?

04:08.666 --> 04:10.156
(walker snarling )

04:26.767 --> 04:28.553
-( blade slices)
- ( thuds)

04:29.562 --> 04:31.848
There you go.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.560
It's a small one.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.111
It'll do.

04:40.364 --> 04:44.403
So, this is just
a simple slipknot.

04:44.577 --> 04:46.113
Tie one on both ends,

04:46.287 --> 04:48.278
then you tighten
one side to a branch.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.447
Now, you see how
the ground here

04:50.624 --> 04:52.580
is sort of like
afunnelshape?

04:52.751 --> 04:55.128
- It's a trail?
- That's right.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.628
That's where you want
to set the noose.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.787
So you hide it
with leaves.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.957
Then you put sticks
all around it

05:01.135 --> 05:03.501
so any animals going by
have to run this way

05:03.679 --> 05:05.795
right into the trap.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.138
Man:
Help!

05:08.309 --> 05:10.220
- Somebody help!
- Carl.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.261
- Carl, stop! Carl!
- Man: Get back! Back!

05:13.439 --> 05:15.976
- ( walkers snarling )
- Help!

05:16.150 --> 05:17.640
Get away!
Get back!

05:17.818 --> 05:19.649
Help!
Somebody help!

05:19.820 --> 05:21.856
Help me!

05:22.031 --> 05:24.022
Get away!

05:24.200 --> 05:25.565
No!

05:25.743 --> 05:27.074
Get away!

05:27.244 --> 05:30.156
- Help! Somebody help!
- We can't help him.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.322
(screaming )

05:35.961 --> 05:38.748
No!No!No!

05:38.923 --> 05:41.790
No!
(screaming )

05:41.967 --> 05:43.173
We've got to go.

06:11.956 --> 06:14.538
Morning.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.573
Everything okay?

06:16.752 --> 06:19.289
Yeah, just want a little
help with something.

06:19.463 --> 06:22.045
What time is it?

06:22.216 --> 06:25.253
I never know what time
it is anymore.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.213
Ever since I gave
Glenn my watch,

06:27.388 --> 06:29.504
it's always
right now to me.

06:29.682 --> 06:31.218
It's early.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.135
He's decent.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.690
- Morning.
- Morning.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.563
Bethy's gonna
take Judith.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.855
Rick:
What are we doing?

06:44.029 --> 06:46.020
You'll see.

06:46.198 --> 06:47.859
You're not going
to need that.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.275
lt'll just get
in the way.

07:03.132 --> 07:04.713
Rick:
Let's go.

07:11.265 --> 07:14.177
Michonne: Thought maybe
there'd be some houses down this way.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.342
Maybe even a store.

07:18.022 --> 07:20.809
There's got to be some food
around here somewhere.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.974
Hey, look.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.695
(walker gurgling)

08:03.025 --> 08:05.562
That was one
small rabbit.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.567
It was something.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.687
Got to hand it
to the thing.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.072
lt traveled well.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.494
( chuckles )

08:14.662 --> 08:18.200
Have you noticed that's all
we talk about anymore?

08:18.374 --> 08:20.160
Food.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.331
| forgot
what this feels like.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.121
Me, too.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.506
I hope we're able
to forget again soon.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.300
We're close.

08:32.471 --> 08:35.133
Just got to make it
through another day.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.513
If folks there are taking people in,
they have to be strong.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.179
They have to have
a system.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.231
I wonder if
the whole thing's legit.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.688
( branches snap )

09:00.457 --> 09:02.243
We let people in.

09:02.418 --> 09:04.124
We did.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.125
So did the Governor.

09:08.674 --> 09:11.086
Yeah, it's always
the same, isn't it?

09:11.260 --> 09:13.501
Don't get to know
until we know.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.255
Maybe this place
isn't even there anymore.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.845
Oh, dearie me.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.930
You screwed up,
asshole.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.893
You hear me?
You screwed up.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.779
Today is a day
of reckoning, sir.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.458
Restitution.

09:43.625 --> 09:47.368
A balancing of the whole
damn universe.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.591
Shit, and lwas thinking
of turning in for the night

09:54.762 --> 09:58.220
on New Year's Eve.
( laughs )

09:58.390 --> 10:01.473
Now who's gonna count
down the ball dropper with me, huh?

10:01.643 --> 10:04.601
10 Mississippi.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.262
Nine Mississippi.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.852
- Eight Mississippi.
- Daryl: Joe!

10:20.287 --> 10:23.620
- Hold up.
- You're stopping me on eight, Daryl.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.792
Just hold up.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.294
This is the guy that killed Lou,
so we got nothing to talk about.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.628
The thing about nowadays
is we got nothing but time.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.088
Say your piece, Daryl.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.971
These people,

10:41.141 --> 10:43.518
you're gonna let 'em go.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.550
These are good people.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.771
Now, I think Lou would
disagree with you on that.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.648
l'll, of course, have to
speak for him and all

10:51.819 --> 10:54.401
'cause your friend here
strangled him in a bathroom.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.816
You want blood,
I get it.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.534
Take it from me, man.

11:06.708 --> 11:09.199
Come on.

11:13.549 --> 11:16.461
This man killed our friend.

11:16.635 --> 11:19.001
You say he's good people.

11:20.138 --> 11:23.756
See, now that
right there is a lie.

11:25.227 --> 11:26.933
It's a lie!

11:27.104 --> 11:28.844
- Come on. ( groans)
- No!

11:29.022 --> 11:31.604
(grunting)

11:31.775 --> 11:33.811
Teach him, fellas.
Teach him all the way.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.653
- No!
- Come here, boy.

11:38.824 --> 11:41.110
You leave him be!

11:43.245 --> 11:44.735
Shh.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.700
You'll get yours.
You just wait your turn.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.833
Listen, it was me.
It was just me.

11:51.003 --> 11:54.541
See, now that's right.
That's not some damn lie.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.956
Look, we can settle this.
We're reasonable men.

11:59.678 --> 12:01.714
First, we're gonna beat
Daryl to death.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.050
Then we'll have the girl.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.180
Then the boy.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.138
Then I'm gonna shoot you
and then we'll be square.

12:09.313 --> 12:11.304
(laughing)

12:17.738 --> 12:19.353
Let him go.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.487
Stop your squirming.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.234
(laughing)

12:27.581 --> 12:29.242
Let him go.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.202
- ( Carl whimpering )
- ( man laughing)

12:31.376 --> 12:34.368
- ( gunshot)
- ( ears ringing)

12:40.552 --> 12:43.043
(coughing)

12:48.393 --> 12:49.724
lgot him.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.681
Oh, it's gonna be
so much worse now.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.595
(whimpering)

12:55.275 --> 12:56.981
(laughing)

12:57.152 --> 12:58.267
Shh.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.029
Come on, get up!

13:15.087 --> 13:17.624
Come on.
Let's see what you got.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.505
- ( groaning)
- Shh. ( laughing)

13:21.885 --> 13:23.421
-( laughing continues)
-( belt buckle clinks)

13:23.595 --> 13:26.758
- You leave him be!
- Huh? Right over here.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.093
What the hell are you
gonna do now, sport?

13:30.477 --> 13:31.887
( screams )

13:32.062 --> 13:34.519
(gurgling)

13:47.786 --> 13:48.821
(gunshot)

13:52.749 --> 13:54.660
I'll kill him.
|'||-- I'll kill him!

13:54.835 --> 13:55.824
Let the boy go.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.539
(grunts)

13:58.839 --> 14:02.127
(gurgling)

14:03.218 --> 14:05.174
He's mine.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.970
Stay back.
Stay--

14:09.141 --> 14:10.631
Please--

14:10.809 --> 14:15.473
(screaming )

14:23.613 --> 14:26.355
(stabbing continues)

14:36.209 --> 14:38.996
(stabbing continues)

14:44.968 --> 14:47.050
Hershel:
Here.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.012
What is?

14:51.183 --> 14:54.425
Those feral pigs
in the forest,

14:54.603 --> 14:57.060
it doesn't take much
to domesticate them.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.562
Same with the horses
we've seen.

14:59.733 --> 15:03.225
We have seeds.
We can grow our own food.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.143
It's time
we started planting.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.608
Okay.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.574
Can't do it myself.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.206
I got to go out there.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.955
Go on runs,
be at the fences.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.629
I teach you
how to do this.

15:21.797 --> 15:23.788
You teach Carl.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.092
We're going to be
here a while.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.966
They need me.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.968
We've been here
two months.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.255
You've made it work.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.889
The war is over, Rick.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.051
No, we don't know that.

15:37.229 --> 15:39.686
I'm talking
aboutyou.

15:39.856 --> 15:43.019
I'm saying it,
and I'm saying this,

15:43.193 --> 15:46.481
you pull Carl back
from going out there, fine.

15:46.655 --> 15:49.442
- He shot that boy.
- Yeah, I know.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.107
He needs his father.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.152
He needs his father
to show him the way.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.322
What way are you
going to show him?

15:58.500 --> 16:01.367
He can shoot,
we know that.

16:01.545 --> 16:04.252
What's his life
going to be?

16:04.422 --> 16:06.799
What's yours?

16:08.510 --> 16:10.592
All this.

16:13.431 --> 16:17.800
I'm just saying
everything

16:17.978 --> 16:19.639
because I owe you.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.979
We all owe you.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.185
We can make this
better now.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.279
Things changing in here

16:31.449 --> 16:33.656
doesn't change
things out there.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.988
No, it doesn't.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.905
But we're here today,
right now.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.947
This is a good place
to start.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.168
( motor starts )

16:45.338 --> 16:47.590
There's a run soon.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.339
- I got to go.
- No, you don't.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.107
We should save it
to drink.

17:54.282 --> 17:57.149
You can't see yourself,
he can.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.878
I didn't know
what they were.

18:12.801 --> 18:14.666
How'd you wind up
with them?

18:14.844 --> 18:17.506
l was with Beth.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.267
We got out together.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.727
l was with her
for a while.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.484
Is she dead?

18:35.031 --> 18:36.942
She's just gone.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.577
After that,

18:43.748 --> 18:45.659
that's when they found me.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.620
I mean, I knew
they were bad,

18:47.794 --> 18:50.786
but they had a code.

18:52.215 --> 18:54.547
It was simple.

18:54.718 --> 18:59.132
Stupid, but it
was something.

18:59.306 --> 19:00.637
It was enough.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.889
And you weren't alone.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.060
Said they were looking
for some guy.

19:09.357 --> 19:12.565
Last night they said
they spotted him.

19:12.736 --> 19:15.728
lwas hanging back.
l was gonna leave.

19:15.905 --> 19:18.191
But I stayed.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.781
That's when I saw
it was you three.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.573
Right when you saw me.

19:31.546 --> 19:35.084
I didn't know
what they could do.

19:40.472 --> 19:42.679
It's not on you, Daryl.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.008
Hey.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.848
It's not on you.

19:50.982 --> 19:54.474
You being back
with us here, now,

19:54.652 --> 19:56.563
that's everything.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.403
You're my brother.

20:20.512 --> 20:22.719
Hey, what you did
last night...

20:24.307 --> 20:26.673
anybody would
have done that.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.342
No, not that.

20:36.319 --> 20:39.652
Something happened.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.154
That ain't you.

20:41.324 --> 20:44.566
Daryl, you saw
what I did to Tyreese.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.827
It ain't all of it, but that's me.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.658
That's why I'm here now.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.290
That's why Car! is.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.667
I want to keep him safe.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.164
That's all that matters.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.314
You okay?

21:17.485 --> 21:19.396
Yeah.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.699
I'm okay.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.656
I know.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.327
How?

21:35.462 --> 21:37.669
'Cause I'm okay, too.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.051
We're getting close.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.060
Be there before sundown.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.517
Now we head through
the woods.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.478
We don't know
who they are.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.983
All right.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.430
We all spread out,

22:34.604 --> 22:37.186
watch for a while,
see what we see,

22:37.357 --> 22:40.019
and get ready.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.104
We all stay close.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.357
You want to stick with me?

22:45.532 --> 22:47.944
It's all right.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.367
Why didn't you go
with your dad?

23:08.388 --> 23:11.551
When I told you
about Andre,

23:11.724 --> 23:14.261
you never asked
how he died.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.266
I knew why.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.770
Yeah, but the how
is important.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.107
We went to a refugee camp.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.729
Andre
and my boyfriend Mike,

23:27.907 --> 23:29.898
that was Andre's father,

23:30.076 --> 23:32.158
and our friend Terry.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.034
At the camp,

23:34.205 --> 23:37.117
it just got worse
and worse.

23:37.292 --> 23:38.907
People were leaving.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.586
People giving up.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.745
But I didn't.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.593
l was coming back
from a run.

23:50.847 --> 23:53.088
I saw the fences were down.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.433
I heard the moans.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.766
It was over.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.477
And Mike and Terry,

24:03.651 --> 24:05.733
they were high
when it happened.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.404
They were bit.

24:12.035 --> 24:14.697
Could have stopped it.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.987
Could have killed them.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.168
But I let them turn.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.085
I made it
so they couldn't bite,

24:25.256 --> 24:27.167
couldn't scratch.

24:27.342 --> 24:29.048
l tied chains
around their necks.

24:29.218 --> 24:31.834
It was insane.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.799
It was sick.

24:35.308 --> 24:37.549
It felt like
what I deserved,

24:37.727 --> 24:41.811
dragging them around
so that I would always know.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.768
I found out that
they kept me safe.

24:48.946 --> 24:50.322
They hid me.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.982
The walkers didn't
see me anymore.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.991
l was just
another monster.

24:57.789 --> 25:00.075
And l was.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.160
Me.

25:02.335 --> 25:05.919
l was gone
for a long time.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.008
But then Andrea
brought me back.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.590
Yourdad
brought me back.

25:16.766 --> 25:18.848
You did.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.515
| see how you've been
looking at your dad.

25:27.694 --> 25:30.652
You don't have
to be afraid of me

25:30.822 --> 25:33.313
or him.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.706
He told me the other day

25:40.873 --> 25:43.080
that he was proud of me.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.293
That I was a good man.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.714
I'm not.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.964
- Carl.
- I know more now. ( sniffles)

25:52.135 --> 25:54.626
About what
he wanted for me.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.635
And I tried, but...

25:58.391 --> 26:00.632
I still have
these thoughts.

26:08.109 --> 26:11.021
I'm not
what he thinks I am.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.236
I'm just another
monster, too.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.697
Just in case.

27:35.238 --> 27:37.024
Woman:
Terminus--

27:37.198 --> 27:39.780
those who arrive survive.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.282
Follow the tracks
to the point

27:41.452 --> 27:43.738
where all lines
intersect.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.699
There are maps
at the crossings

27:45.873 --> 27:48.455
to help guide you
with yourjourney.

27:48.626 --> 27:51.333
Sanctuary for all.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.620
Community for all.

27:53.798 --> 27:56.164
Those who arrive survive.

27:56.342 --> 27:59.505
Terminus,
sanctuary for all.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.010
- Community for all.
- Hello.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.511
Those who s--

28:02.682 --> 28:03.967
Hello.

28:09.146 --> 28:12.013
Well, I bet Albert
is on perimeter watch.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.771
You here to rob us?

28:20.950 --> 28:23.032
No.

28:24.871 --> 28:28.034
We wanted to see you
before you saw us.

28:31.794 --> 28:34.035
Makes sense.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.953
Usually we do this
where the tracks meet.

28:36.132 --> 28:37.793
Ahem.

28:37.967 --> 28:40.299
Welcome to Terminus.

28:41.762 --> 28:44.469
l'm Gareth.

28:44.640 --> 28:47.097
Looks like you've been
on the road for a good bit.

28:47.268 --> 28:49.509
We have.

28:51.105 --> 28:54.393
Rick. That's Carl,
Daryl, Michonne.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.402
You're nervous.
I get it.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.110
We were all the same way.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.900
We came here for sanctuary.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.739
That what you're here for?

29:08.831 --> 29:09.946
Yes.

29:10.124 --> 29:11.660
Good.

29:11.834 --> 29:14.371
You found it.
Hey, Alex.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.957
This isn't as pretty
as the front.

29:17.131 --> 29:18.541
We got nothing to hide,
but the welcome wagon

29:18.716 --> 29:21.253
is a whole lot nicer.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.588
Alex will take you,
ask you a few questions.

29:23.763 --> 29:26.379
Uh, but first,

29:26.557 --> 29:28.889
we need to see
everyone's weapons.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.267
If you could just lay them
down in front of you.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.985
All right.

29:45.159 --> 29:47.775
- I'm sure you understand.
- Yes, I do.

29:57.171 --> 29:59.412
I'd hate to see the other guy.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.330
You would.

30:03.928 --> 30:06.761
- They deserve it?
- Yes.

30:09.642 --> 30:11.974
Just so you know,
we aren't those kind of people,

30:12.144 --> 30:13.930
but we aren't
stupid either.

30:14.105 --> 30:17.893
And you shouldn't be stupid enough
to try anything stupid.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.183
As long as everyone's clear
on that, we shouldn't have any problems.

30:20.361 --> 30:23.068
Just solutions.

30:24.281 --> 30:25.817
Okay.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.672
Follow me.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.347
So how long's
this place been here?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.683
Since almost the start.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.644
When all the camps
got overrun,

31:00.818 --> 31:02.228
people started
finding this place.

31:02.403 --> 31:05.019
I think it was instinct,
you know?

31:05.197 --> 31:07.483
Follow a path.

31:07.658 --> 31:08.989
Some folks were
heading to the coast,

31:09.160 --> 31:11.196
others out west
or up north,

31:11.370 --> 31:14.157
but they all
wound up here.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.912
Hi.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.870
Heard you came in
the back door. Smart.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.831
You'll fit
right in here.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.919
Hey, Mary, would you fix each
of these new folks a plate for me?

31:27.136 --> 31:29.377
Michonne:
Why do you do it?

31:29.555 --> 31:31.136
Why do you let
people in?

31:31.307 --> 31:34.424
The more people become a part of us,
we get stronger.

31:34.602 --> 31:37.184
That's why we put up
the signs,

31:37.354 --> 31:39.515
invite people in.

31:39.690 --> 31:41.601
It's how we survive.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.396
Here.

31:54.497 --> 31:56.033
No.

32:03.089 --> 32:05.330
Where the hell
did you get this watch?

32:30.533 --> 32:34.196
- Hey, Patrick.
- Hey, Mr. Grimes.

32:34.370 --> 32:36.031
Thanks for grabbing these.

32:36.205 --> 32:38.821
Well, I thought
Carl might want 'em.

32:38.999 --> 32:42.241
They were just
sitting there.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.623
I figured
it had been a while.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.799
I'm not ashamed that
they're for ages four to 12.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.426
You shouldn't be.

33:01.188 --> 33:03.019
Hey.

33:03.190 --> 33:04.726
Hey.

33:20.374 --> 33:22.490
- Carl.
- Yes?

33:24.712 --> 33:26.998
Carl.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.835
I need your help
with something.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.261
What?

33:41.812 --> 33:44.144
lt'll just
get in the way.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.561
Rick: Where the hell
did you get this watch?

33:47.735 --> 33:49.771
You want answers?
You want anything else?

33:49.945 --> 33:51.776
You get 'em when
you put down the gun.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.279
| see your man
on the roof with a sniper rifle.

33:54.450 --> 33:56.862
How good's his aim?
Where'd you get the watch?

34:01.332 --> 34:03.869
- Where'd you get the watch?!
- Don't do anything!

34:04.043 --> 34:07.001
l have this!
You just put it down.

34:07.171 --> 34:08.832
You put it down!

34:09.006 --> 34:11.543
You want to listen to me.
There's a lot of us.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.379
Where did you
get the watch?

34:14.553 --> 34:15.884
I got it off
of a dead one.

34:16.055 --> 34:17.591
I didn't think
he'd need it.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.057
Rick: What about the riot gear?
The poncho?

34:22.228 --> 34:24.890
Got the riot gear
off a dead cop.

34:25.064 --> 34:27.055
Found the poncho
on a clothesline.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.274
- Gareth, we can wait.
- Shut up, Alex.

34:31.445 --> 34:32.946
You talk to me.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.075
What's there
left to say?

34:37.243 --> 34:38.653
You don't trust us
anymore.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.783
- Gareth.
- Shut up.

34:40.955 --> 34:43.241
- Gareth, please.
- It's okay.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.155
It's okay.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.794
Rick, what do you want?

34:47.962 --> 34:49.668
Where are our people?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.544
You didn't answer
the question.

34:51.715 --> 34:52.704
(gunfire)

34:52.883 --> 34:54.339
- Man: Go, go!
- Gareth: Hey!

34:54.510 --> 34:56.250
- ( men shouting )
-( radio chatter)

34:56.428 --> 34:58.168
Carl!

34:58.347 --> 35:00.338
Get down, now!
Go!

35:00.516 --> 35:01.631
Man over radio:
Shots fired in the main.

35:01.809 --> 35:02.798
Heading into the building.

35:03.811 --> 35:05.176
Come on!

35:06.230 --> 35:09.893
(gunfire)

35:11.151 --> 35:12.891
Come on!

35:20.369 --> 35:21.859
Here!

35:31.630 --> 35:34.713
- Man over radio: Stay on your shot.
- ( gunfire)

35:40.097 --> 35:42.964
- Come on, this way.
- Gareth: Get them off B!

35:46.270 --> 35:48.431
( radio chatter continues )

35:53.986 --> 35:56.477
- Voices: Help! Help!
- What the hell?

35:56.655 --> 35:58.816
-( banging )
- Let us out!

35:58.991 --> 36:00.447
- Help!
- Keep going.

36:00.617 --> 36:02.278
Help!

36:08.167 --> 36:10.078
What the hell
is this place?

36:10.252 --> 36:14.245
These people,
I don't think they're trying to kill us.

36:14.423 --> 36:16.835
Rick: No, they were
aiming at our feet.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.380
There.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.931
There.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.603
Go!

36:32.524 --> 36:34.264
(gunfire)

37:07.726 --> 37:11.639
Gareth:
Drop your weapons! Now!

37:23.325 --> 37:25.486
Now!

37:31.583 --> 37:34.199
Ringleader,
go to your left.

37:34.378 --> 37:36.539
The train car, go.

37:39.049 --> 37:41.131
You do what we say,
the boy goes with you.

37:41.301 --> 37:45.260
Anything else, he dies
and you end up in there anyway.

37:57.234 --> 37:59.190
Now the archer.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.778
Now the samurai.

38:35.564 --> 38:38.021
Stand at the door,
ringleader,

38:38.192 --> 38:40.808
archer, samurai,
in that order.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.649
My son.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.453
Go, kid.

39:00.547 --> 39:03.505
Ringleader,
open the door and go in.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.415
I'll go in with him.

39:05.594 --> 39:07.334
Don't make us
kill him now.

39:55.227 --> 39:57.263
(thuds)

40:02.359 --> 40:04.099
Rick?

40:08.699 --> 40:10.564
You're here.

40:15.706 --> 40:17.492
You're here.

40:31.471 --> 40:33.462
They're our friends.

40:36.643 --> 40:38.599
They helped save us.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.477
Yeah.

40:41.648 --> 40:44.264
Now they're
friends of ours.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.900
For however long
that'll be.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.111
No.

40:59.458 --> 41:02.325
( laughs)
There you go, Judith.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.333
There you go.

41:07.716 --> 41:09.752
Put it in at more
of an angle.

41:14.014 --> 41:16.426
Whoa.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.387
Gonna have to get you
a farming hat.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.012
There's a new sheriff
in town.

41:23.190 --> 41:25.055
(all laugh)

41:25.233 --> 41:27.098
- How's it look?
- Looks good.

41:27.277 --> 41:30.269
(laughing)

41:31.698 --> 41:34.360
It can be like this
all the time.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.569
It's like this now.

41:40.332 --> 41:41.913
That's enough.

41:50.550 --> 41:54.213
They're gonna feel
pretty stupid when they find out.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.468
Find out what?

42:16.660 --> 42:19.276
They're fucking
with the wrong people.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.667
