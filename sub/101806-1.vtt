48:34.520 --> 48:36.391
You think she'’s behind
the crash with your family?

48:36.565 --> 48:38.916
Yeah, I do!
I mean she'’s there.

48:41.483 --> 48:42.745
Jimmy.

48:44.095 --> 48:46.314
They bring them,
take them there.

48:54.409 --> 48:57.586
There'’s an entire underground
bunker, there'’s cells monitoring
this whole place.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.894
-Wander is like a--
it'’s a testing ground.
-No shit.

49:14.342 --> 49:17.345
And they insert these implants.
They'’re keeping them here,
they'’re tracking '’em.

49:17.519 --> 49:19.521
Just like we'’ve talked about
all this time.

49:26.267 --> 49:29.575
[indistinct shouting]

49:34.623 --> 49:35.842
My God.

49:37.235 --> 49:39.150
New version or the old?

49:54.992 --> 49:57.081
Zoe tried to run.

49:57.255 --> 49:59.344
Jimmy, listen to me.

49:59.518 --> 50:01.868
I'’ve scoured every
police database I can find,

50:02.042 --> 50:03.130
Zoe never shows up.

50:03.304 --> 50:05.002
But look at this.

50:05.176 --> 50:08.092
Jimmy, check out this
missing person'’s report.

50:08.266 --> 50:12.400
-[Jimmy] Martina Lopez?
-No, Zoe.

50:12.574 --> 50:16.100
Elena'’s been lying to us
the whole time, Jimmy.

50:16.274 --> 50:18.145
Her real name isn'’t Elena.

50:18.319 --> 50:21.714
It'’s Sofia Lopez,
and Zoe is Martina Lopez.

50:21.888 --> 50:25.718
Both reported missing.
The people controlling all this,
they'’re clearly--

50:25.892 --> 50:29.243
They'’re bringing people here.
They'’re changing their names,
they'’re erasing their past.

50:29.417 --> 50:32.507
I mean, the people here
in Wander, they'’re all trapped.

50:39.079 --> 50:42.082
Jimmy, she knows you.
Gives us away.

50:42.256 --> 50:44.258
I'’ll be round back.Roger that.

51:48.540 --> 51:51.020
-Why'’d they send you to me?
-It'’s all your fault!

51:51.195 --> 51:52.457
[grunts]

51:54.415 --> 51:56.330
They killed her!

51:56.504 --> 51:58.506
-[shrieks]
-[groans]

52:01.030 --> 52:03.207
Zoe'’s dead because of you.

52:04.686 --> 52:06.645
[beeping]

52:06.819 --> 52:07.994
Jimmy'’s in on it.

52:08.168 --> 52:09.648
[beeping intensifies]

52:35.239 --> 52:36.414
[Jimmy] Arthur!

52:37.154 --> 52:38.677
Jesus Christ, Arthur.

52:40.113 --> 52:42.420
Goddamn.
Did you shoot her, Arthur?

52:42.594 --> 52:44.813
Jimmy, I can'’t remember
telling you

52:44.987 --> 52:47.033
where I was
in my voice mail.

52:47.599 --> 52:48.861
Huh?

52:50.123 --> 52:52.212
"Jimmy'’s in on it."

52:52.386 --> 52:54.954
That'’s the last thing she said.Let'’s just take
a deep breath.

52:55.128 --> 52:57.696
No, Jimmy, see,
I'’m getting confused

52:57.870 --> 53:00.786
and I can'’t decipher
if it'’s you or if it'’s me!

53:00.960 --> 53:02.004
All right.

53:03.702 --> 53:06.270
I'’ll make a confession, Arthur.

53:08.489 --> 53:10.535
I lied to you.

53:10.709 --> 53:14.669
Elena first made contact with me
through the PI website
that I built for you.

53:14.843 --> 53:17.977
And I told her
to call the show.

53:18.151 --> 53:19.283
[sighs]

53:20.066 --> 53:23.156
I, uh, needed the money.

53:24.157 --> 53:26.638
And I'’m sorry, all right?

53:26.812 --> 53:30.903
But I always had a gut feeling
that there was--

53:31.077 --> 53:32.861
there was something more
to all of this--

53:33.035 --> 53:35.299
Wander, Elena, Zoe--

53:35.473 --> 53:38.824
[Arthur] Jimmy.Some link between here

53:38.998 --> 53:41.435
and what happened
to your family.

53:41.609 --> 53:43.916
-Don'’t talk about my family.
-And I was right.

53:45.700 --> 53:47.006
We were right.

53:47.180 --> 53:49.269
Jimmy, I'’m barely
hanging on here.

53:51.750 --> 53:52.881
Arthur.

53:53.752 --> 53:55.797
We'’re pinning down the truth.

53:59.279 --> 54:00.585
Stay with it.

54:02.195 --> 54:03.631
You know me.

54:04.328 --> 54:05.633
Do I, Jimmy?

54:06.721 --> 54:10.551
[traditional Native American

54:12.466 --> 54:14.555
[grunting]

54:41.365 --> 54:43.149
I'’ll take it from here.

Marked by a cross.

55:14.093 --> 55:16.443
I never wanted blood
on my hands.

55:20.273 --> 55:22.101
It'’s a war, Jimmy...

55:24.451 --> 55:26.323
between the dark
and the light.

55:31.110 --> 55:32.372
Light.

55:34.243 --> 55:36.158
You'’re light, Jimmy.

55:36.333 --> 55:37.638
I hope so.

55:46.952 --> 55:50.477
Every name on this ledger
comes back as a missing person.

55:50.651 --> 55:52.827
Every one of these people
are trapped in Wander.

55:53.001 --> 55:56.178
-Martina, Sofia--
-Zoe and Elena.

55:56.353 --> 55:58.398
Reported missing,
Amarillo, Texas.

55:58.572 --> 56:00.008
We got these two.

56:00.182 --> 56:02.010
All right, I saw them
at the truck stop

56:02.184 --> 56:04.273
and then trapped
at the Fox Hole.

56:04.448 --> 56:07.276
Men, women, different ages,
various races.

56:07.451 --> 56:09.278
Yeah, but they all have
one thing in common.

56:09.453 --> 56:11.063
Hell yeah,
they'’re all immigrants.

56:11.237 --> 56:14.022
That'’s Ukraine, Syria,
Trinidad, Korea.

56:14.196 --> 56:15.720
I mean
the list goes on and on.

56:15.894 --> 56:17.983
And what the hell does it
have to do with you.

56:18.157 --> 56:19.898
I got too close
to my John Doe case.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.075
But why lure you here?

56:26.034 --> 56:27.645
Well, we'’re gonna find out.

56:27.819 --> 56:31.518
Jimmy, tomorrow
I'’m going back to the Fox Hole.

56:32.389 --> 56:33.781
Hell yeah.

56:35.130 --> 56:37.742
This needs to be exposed.

57:18.043 --> 57:20.567
[Arthur] <i>Hey, Shell.</i>

57:20.741 --> 57:23.135
<i>Look, I haven'’t been
totally honest</i>

57:23.309 --> 57:28.183
<i>about what I'’ve been working on here in Wander.</i>

57:30.403 --> 57:34.494
<i>I got hired
to investigate a murder.</i>

57:35.930 --> 57:37.628
<i>But here'’s the thing, Shell.</i>

57:39.151 --> 57:41.153
<i>It'’s linked
to something bigger.</i>

57:42.371 --> 57:44.330
<i>And I'’m directly involved.</i>

57:55.297 --> 57:58.083
<i>All I need is a name, Shell.</i>

57:58.257 --> 58:02.522
<i>This time,
I'’m gonna prove it all.</i>

58:02.696 --> 58:07.048
Look-- hey, whoa.
I checked it out, Wander.
It'’s a sleepy old town.

58:07.222 --> 58:09.268
He'’s-- he'’s fine.I'’m gonna go.

58:09.442 --> 58:11.531
Shell, this is not your battle
to fight with him.He'’s done this before.

58:11.705 --> 58:14.447
He stretches stories,
changes the truth,
becomes completely delusional.

58:14.621 --> 58:16.928
Right, and who does
he always drag into it?

58:17.102 --> 58:19.060
He'’s going to end up
hurting himself
or someone else.

58:19.234 --> 58:21.280
Like you. And I don'’t want
that to happen.

58:22.237 --> 58:23.543
So let'’s give it the night.

58:23.717 --> 58:25.937
And if he still doesn'’t
answer his phone,

58:26.111 --> 58:29.288
we will go down there
and we'’ll go down together
and we'’ll sort it all out.

58:31.551 --> 58:33.161
All right,
this is the Fox Hole.

58:33.335 --> 58:35.076
No one'’s here
this time of day.

58:36.382 --> 58:38.602
I'’m gonna download everything
from the computers.

58:38.776 --> 58:40.908
You get
the footage of everything
from inside the lab.

58:41.082 --> 58:45.217
If I go down...
you keep running.

58:45.391 --> 58:50.091
And, Jimmy, if that happens,
you gotta promise me one thing.

58:50.265 --> 58:53.530
Yeah?You take care of Tanya.

58:55.793 --> 58:56.881
I will.

1:00:07.342 --> 1:00:10.128
Shelley, I need you here
tomorrow morning, 10:00 a.m.

1:00:10.302 --> 1:00:12.478
I'’ll text you the details
as soon as I know them.

-A resident of Wander for
25 years. He'’s a scientist--
-No.

1:02:41.758 --> 1:02:43.368
He created the chip technology.

1:02:43.542 --> 1:02:45.718
He'’s selling it to people,
putting it into people.

1:02:45.892 --> 1:02:49.287
They were all involved.
With the implants,
my accident, everything.

1:02:56.642 --> 1:02:59.601
The entrance to the Fox Hole
was right there.

1:02:59.776 --> 1:03:02.822
Right there.
You open this garage,
there'’s a red car there.

1:03:02.996 --> 1:03:05.129
You push a lever,
the car goes up.

1:03:06.957 --> 1:03:08.480
There is nothing there, Arthur.

1:03:11.004 --> 1:03:12.527
That'’s impossible.

And there was
a woman too, Elsa.

<i>CIA, I think.
She took me to the garage.</i>

1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:08.486
She'’s the one in the photos

Lower class, broken homes.

There, I said it for you.

[Elsa] They lure them
here with the promise
of money, housing,

1:06:52.443 --> 1:06:54.532
in exchange
for medical testing.

1:06:54.706 --> 1:06:57.622
Insert the implant
and they'’re trapped.

I'’m not who you think I am,
Arthur.

We'’re all on the same team.

You can call me "Elsa."

His real name
was Filipe Jimenez.

Your John Doe from the church.

He'’s a Colombian refugee
who escaped when his implant
malfunctioned.

1:07:26.346 --> 1:07:28.392
Canton couldn'’t have you
looking into things,

1:07:28.566 --> 1:07:31.090
-so he had the body stolen
from the morgue.
-Who'’s Canton?

1:07:31.264 --> 1:07:34.833
Victor Canton.
Early adopter
of chip technology.

1:07:35.007 --> 1:07:36.835
He single-handedly
advanced the field.

1:07:37.009 --> 1:07:39.316
He developed tech
that could track movement,

1:07:39.490 --> 1:07:41.013
location, vitals.

1:07:41.187 --> 1:07:42.841
It was revolutionary.

1:07:43.015 --> 1:07:45.278
And attractive
to foreign investors.

1:07:45.452 --> 1:07:47.063
Now, what'’s
the Oryon Project?

1:07:48.281 --> 1:07:51.502
Canton changed. He got greedy.

1:07:51.676 --> 1:07:53.243
Funding sources
became anonymous.

1:07:53.417 --> 1:07:55.071
Bigger parties
with deeper pockets.

1:07:55.245 --> 1:07:56.985
The fact that Wander
uses immigrants

1:07:57.160 --> 1:07:59.423
for its testing
is not an accident.

1:07:59.597 --> 1:08:02.034
He took a black ops
government security contract

1:08:02.208 --> 1:08:04.036
and shifted his focus
to border control.

1:08:04.210 --> 1:08:07.909
Border control.
He'’ll control everybody.
So there'’s that.

1:08:08.084 --> 1:08:11.522
The chip links
directly to the subject'’s
central nervous system.

1:08:11.696 --> 1:08:16.962
When it reaches a set radius,
it could be frozen or shut down.

1:08:17.136 --> 1:08:19.486
And you guys can murder
whoever you want.

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:23.055
Not exactly how
Canton sees it, but yes.

1:08:23.229 --> 1:08:26.580
[Santiago] He told us
his intentions were to progress
the greater good of humanity,

1:08:26.754 --> 1:08:29.017
not to create weapons
for the highest bidder.

1:08:29.192 --> 1:08:30.932
And you just go along
for the ride, huh?

1:08:33.805 --> 1:08:35.546
Not anymore.

1:08:35.720 --> 1:08:38.026
Wander has helped shape
Canton'’s business model.

1:08:38.201 --> 1:08:40.812
Him and his investors
are on the verge
of going wide with the tech.

1:08:40.986 --> 1:08:43.989
-Why am I here?
-Canton was the one
that made the call

1:08:44.163 --> 1:08:45.730
on the hit and run
of your car.

1:08:49.647 --> 1:08:51.170
He killed my daughter?

1:08:53.868 --> 1:08:55.783
I wanted you to know that.

1:09:00.875 --> 1:09:02.529
I am so sorry.

1:09:09.667 --> 1:09:12.278
You'’ve been watching me?

1:09:12.452 --> 1:09:14.759
Because I'’ve been waiting
for the day I could
tell you all this.

1:09:14.933 --> 1:09:16.804
You deserved
to know the truth.

1:09:17.457 --> 1:09:19.372
The truth.

1:09:19.546 --> 1:09:22.723
Arthur, you are here
because I wanna offer you
an opportunity.

1:09:22.897 --> 1:09:25.944
-What opportunity?
-I know the pain
Canton'’s actions

1:09:26.118 --> 1:09:27.641
have caused you with Tanya.

1:09:27.815 --> 1:09:30.166
I know how you struggle
with what happened to Cleo.

1:09:30.340 --> 1:09:32.472
You don'’t know anything.

1:09:34.213 --> 1:09:36.389
[Elsa]
I'’ve lost people too.
It'’s not right.

1:09:38.652 --> 1:09:40.437
Canton is hardly ever here
in Wander,

1:09:40.611 --> 1:09:42.874
but there'’s a meeting set
tomorrow morning.

1:09:43.048 --> 1:09:46.878
It'’s his last meeting before
he sells the Oryon Project.

1:09:47.052 --> 1:09:49.533
Arthur, you can'’t tell me you
don'’t wanna go face to face

1:09:49.707 --> 1:09:52.144
with the man that destroyed
your family,

1:09:52.318 --> 1:09:54.929
to get revenge
for your daughter.

1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:57.018
Justice.

1:10:00.805 --> 1:10:03.416
That'’s the opportunity
I'’m offering you.

1:10:26.831 --> 1:10:27.962
[Arthur] <i>The plan was--</i>

1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:30.356
<i>it was set.</i>

1:10:32.053 --> 1:10:34.055
<i>That'’s when
I called you, Shell.</i>

1:10:42.325 --> 1:10:43.456
Arthur!

1:10:43.630 --> 1:10:45.850
Shelley, Jimmy'’s dead.

1:10:49.854 --> 1:10:52.596
But, uh, the things,
they changed.

1:10:53.727 --> 1:10:57.557
[traditional Native American
song playing]

1:11:05.261 --> 1:11:06.871
First time meeting him.

1:11:12.833 --> 1:11:14.400
Luis.

1:11:14.574 --> 1:11:16.576
[song continues]

1:11:28.675 --> 1:11:30.198
Follow my lead.

1:12:01.229 --> 1:12:02.840
Santiago,
what are we doing here?

1:12:03.014 --> 1:12:04.145
Now!

1:12:05.233 --> 1:12:06.626
[gunfire]

1:12:08.106 --> 1:12:09.281
What are you doing?

1:12:10.543 --> 1:12:11.979
Always knew
I couldn'’t trust you.

1:12:16.723 --> 1:12:20.988
Elsa, Santiago told me
you were shot dead yesterday.

1:12:21.162 --> 1:12:23.469
Had to get you here somehow.

1:12:23.643 --> 1:12:28.518
Lost your focus a long time ago,
Victor, and I'’m tired.

1:12:35.176 --> 1:12:36.613
What are you doing?

1:12:44.142 --> 1:12:47.145
You want your apology?
Now'’s your chance.

1:12:48.799 --> 1:12:52.324
Victor Canton,
meet Arthur Bretnik.

1:12:56.328 --> 1:12:58.809
Do it, Arthur.
He murdered your daughter.

1:13:00.898 --> 1:13:03.944
You think killing me
is gonna stop any of this?

1:13:05.642 --> 1:13:08.427
Shooting me is exactly
what they want.

1:13:08.601 --> 1:13:10.908
You shoot, they win.

1:13:13.432 --> 1:13:15.086
Just why don'’t you say it?

1:13:15.260 --> 1:13:18.089
-You have no idea
the complexities--
-Say it!

1:13:18.263 --> 1:13:20.439
-This is bigger than all of us.
-Say it!

1:13:20.613 --> 1:13:23.964
You were supposed to be alone.
I wasn'’t driving the truck.

1:13:25.966 --> 1:13:27.141
Say it!

1:14:22.066 --> 1:14:24.111
[faint chattering]

1:14:32.076 --> 1:14:34.295
[chattering continues]

1:14:36.210 --> 1:14:39.518
[Tanya] <i>Look at that.
Look at that determination.</i>

1:14:39.692 --> 1:14:41.868
[Arthur] <i>Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!</i>

1:14:45.916 --> 1:14:47.439
Arthur, it'’s okay.

1:14:50.442 --> 1:14:53.184
Drop the gun. I'’ll handle this.

1:14:53.358 --> 1:14:55.491
Get to the office
and wipe down the computer.

1:15:15.815 --> 1:15:16.816
It'’s done.

1:15:59.293 --> 1:16:00.425
Give us a minute.

1:16:06.866 --> 1:16:08.476
[Shelley] <i>You know, these are psychotics.</i>

1:16:08.651 --> 1:16:11.001
<i>And they'’re known
to create acute anxiety</i>

1:16:11.175 --> 1:16:14.308
and paranoid delusions
in people with a history
of mental illness.

1:16:14.482 --> 1:16:16.659
How long you been mixing these?

1:16:17.529 --> 1:16:19.923
They played you.

1:16:20.097 --> 1:16:23.013
You don'’t know how powerful
these people are.
They'’re connected everywhere.

1:16:23.187 --> 1:16:25.102
For all I know,
this is all part of it.

1:16:25.276 --> 1:16:28.192
Listen, I'’m here as your lawyer,
not just your friend.

1:16:28.366 --> 1:16:30.977
And I wonder if there'’s anything
we'’re missing.

1:16:31.804 --> 1:16:32.936
You want proof?

1:16:34.067 --> 1:16:36.113
I have one of the chips in me!

1:16:37.201 --> 1:16:39.943
After the accident,
they put a chip in me.

1:16:40.639 --> 1:16:42.075
Are you one of them?

1:16:43.903 --> 1:16:46.558
I think you'’re sick again,
Arthur.

1:16:46.732 --> 1:16:49.474
[Arthur] <i>You need to check the addresses again.</i>

1:16:49.648 --> 1:16:52.608
<i>Just check '’em.[Shelley] We checked-- <i>They checked every address.</i></i>

1:16:52.782 --> 1:16:54.435
<i>They went to Elena'’s house. Check '’em again.</i>

1:16:54.610 --> 1:16:56.829
[Shelley] <i>It was boarded up. Check '’em again.</i>

1:16:57.003 --> 1:17:00.616
[Shelley] <i>And the property was reclaimed after the owner died. <i>The bank claimed it.</i></i>

1:17:00.790 --> 1:17:03.531
<i>And the morgue where you said you found the bodies,</i>

1:17:03.706 --> 1:17:05.708
<i>
it hasn'’t been in use
for years.</i>

1:17:14.934 --> 1:17:17.067
We found your car.

1:17:17.241 --> 1:17:18.634
What do you mean,
you found my car?

1:17:25.379 --> 1:17:27.033
<i>You-- you found it?
You found my car?</i>

1:17:27.207 --> 1:17:28.469
[Shelley] <i>Yeah.</i>

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:33.649
What'’s the problem?
'’Cause it has all the files
from the case.

1:17:33.823 --> 1:17:35.738
It has the addresses
I can'’t remember.

1:17:35.912 --> 1:17:38.654
[Shelley]
But the problem is
what we found in your car.

1:17:38.828 --> 1:17:40.220
[Arthur] What did you find?

1:17:42.092 --> 1:17:44.050
Jimmy. [sighs]

1:17:58.804 --> 1:18:00.501
He was decapitated.

1:18:13.906 --> 1:18:15.429
Did I...

1:19:23.715 --> 1:19:24.977
Hi.

1:19:26.283 --> 1:19:28.720
[chattering]

1:19:31.767 --> 1:19:33.203
Morning.

1:19:47.086 --> 1:19:48.827
You and that stuff.

1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:51.221
Anything interesting?

1:19:56.182 --> 1:19:59.446
We'’re all just puppets
to the man.

1:19:59.620 --> 1:20:02.710
Arthur Bretnik,
my resident conspiracist.

1:20:09.369 --> 1:20:11.328
I like airplanes.

1:20:13.156 --> 1:20:14.592
[chuckles]

1:20:48.365 --> 1:20:49.932
How you doing, Arthur boy?

1:20:50.889 --> 1:20:51.934
[Arthur] Jimmy.

1:20:58.288 --> 1:20:59.593
I knew it.

1:20:59.767 --> 1:21:02.074
I made you a promise.

1:21:02.248 --> 1:21:05.121
Tanya will never want
for anything.

1:21:07.645 --> 1:21:10.169
Of that, you can be sure.

1:21:17.350 --> 1:21:19.962
Whose body
was in the trunk?

1:21:21.528 --> 1:21:23.443
[Jimmy]
Does it really matter,
Arthur?

1:21:26.577 --> 1:21:29.841
Did Canton actually order
the hit on my family?

1:21:31.887 --> 1:21:33.018
I need to know.

1:21:33.192 --> 1:21:34.672
You deserved your revenge.

1:21:34.846 --> 1:21:36.326
Yes or no?[Jimmy] Arthur.

1:21:36.500 --> 1:21:38.545
Tell me![Elsa] Yes, Arthur.

1:21:39.155 --> 1:21:40.721
He did.

1:21:40.896 --> 1:21:43.072
We owed you that much.

1:21:44.421 --> 1:21:46.118
Why me?

1:21:46.292 --> 1:21:49.165
[Elsa]
Every good conspiracy
needs a patsy.

1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:56.302
[Jimmy] <i>When Filipe and Zoe escaped,</i>

1:21:56.476 --> 1:22:00.176
<i>Wander and Canton
became a liability.</i>

1:22:01.525 --> 1:22:04.441
<i>We needed to clean things up.</i>

1:22:04.615 --> 1:22:07.574
<i>We knew if we left you
enough clues...</i>

1:22:10.403 --> 1:22:12.840
<i>nudged you
in the right direction...</i>

1:22:17.671 --> 1:22:20.022
<i>someone in your mental state</i>

1:22:20.196 --> 1:22:22.372
<i>might be able
to shoulder the burden</i>

1:22:22.546 --> 1:22:25.418
<i>of tying up loose ends.</i>

1:22:25.592 --> 1:22:28.421
If anyone ever tries to expose
what'’s happening in Wander,

1:22:28.595 --> 1:22:31.685
we'’ll be able to deflect,
pin it back to you.

1:22:33.687 --> 1:22:35.951
A man unhinged.

1:22:38.475 --> 1:22:40.346
[Arthur] Who are you people?

1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:42.435
[Jimmy]
And you said it yourself,
Arthur.

1:22:42.609 --> 1:22:44.829
It'’s all about keeping
a tight grip.

1:22:45.003 --> 1:22:50.182
Immigration, incarceration,
border control...

1:22:53.185 --> 1:22:55.187
these are all
big concerns for us.

1:22:56.710 --> 1:22:58.538
Pawn, patsy or dead.

1:23:01.541 --> 1:23:04.240
Two outta three ain'’t bad,
huh, Jimmy?

1:23:04.414 --> 1:23:07.199
Hmm, you'’re a good man,
Arthur.
