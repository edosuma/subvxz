Katarina:
6,000 milliliters.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.023
That's how much blood

00:08.030 --> 00:11.079

has in his body.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.116

than a gallon of milk.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.076

They say a man can lose
up to 40% of his blood,

00:20.000 --> 00:21.137
You've lost 20%.

the palpitations.

Your heart can't fill with blood

But not as smart
as Steinhil,

need-to-know.

None of them know the name

02:11.190 --> 02:13.988
of the woman who hired him
to con Mr. Reddington.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.139
Just why she did it -- to ask
what he knows about my mother.

02:16.150 --> 02:18.186
I'm less interested in the why
than in the where.

02:18.190 --> 02:21.079
If Steinhil employed all these
people to create the illusion

02:21.090 --> 02:23.069
that Reddington was
in a French hospital,

02:23.070 --> 02:24.173
where the hell was he
when we got there?

02:24.180 --> 02:26.990
Apparently, he escaped.
Or tried to.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.012
He got less than a block.

02:28.020 --> 02:29.112
But the hospital gag
was blown,

02:29.120 --> 02:30.997
so they moved him
somewhere else,

02:31.000 --> 02:32.058
but we don't know where.

02:32.060 --> 02:33.209
Let's start at the beginning.
Paris.

02:33.220 --> 02:36.109
Mr. Reddington went to meet with
someone he felt safe enough with

02:36.110 --> 02:37.145
that he didn't bring Dembe.

02:37.150 --> 02:39.141
Or he went alone
to keep a secret.

02:39.150 --> 02:41.141
From Dembe?
That must be some secret.

02:41.150 --> 02:44.039
What else?
He was abducted in Paris,

02:44.050 --> 02:46.109
then flown to Annapolis.
Why?

02:46.110 --> 02:47.168
Could be
there's something there

02:47.170 --> 02:49.104
that they needed Reddington's
help to find.

02:49.110 --> 02:51.180
Something or someone.

02:51.190 --> 02:53.169

02:53.180 --> 02:55.068
I thought your mother
was dead.

02:55.070 --> 02:57.049
Maybe that's what
she wanted us to think.

02:57.050 --> 02:58.119
Even you?

02:58.120 --> 02:59.200
Apparently, she's not
the maternal type.

02:59.210 --> 03:02.145
So far, I'm hearing a lot
of maybe's and could be's,

03:02.150 --> 03:04.152
a lot of theory,
almost no fact.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.209
Here's a fact -- creating
a French hospital in Annapolis

03:07.210 --> 03:08.996
takes planning.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.206
All the doctors,
nurses, police,

03:10.210 --> 03:12.166
they all were sent
to the same location

03:12.170 --> 03:14.058

for their wardrobe.

03:14.060 --> 03:15.118

If they couldn't con Reddington

03:18.210 --> 03:20.110
into telling them
what they wanted to know,

03:20.120 --> 03:23.044
they're probably trying
to beat it out of him.
