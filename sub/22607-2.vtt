WEBVTT

00:02.308 --> 00:04.374
Previously on Tut...

00:05.673 --> 00:07.937
Ay is a trusted
and loyal advisor,

00:07.938 --> 00:08.937
As he was to my father.

00:08.938 --> 00:10.102
(Ka) But to what end?

00:10.104 --> 00:11.669
The priests still
take advantage of your people.

00:11.670 --> 00:14.804
The Mitanni steal food and crops
from our borderlands.

00:15.802 --> 00:18.200
We must have a child if
we're going to survive, sister.

00:18.201 --> 00:20.664
Perhaps your mind
is with someone else.

00:20.666 --> 00:24.396
Use discretion, my queen.
He sees more than you know.

00:24.397 --> 00:27.527
I serve only the greater good
of Egypt.

00:27.529 --> 00:29.060
No, general, you serve me.

00:29.061 --> 00:32.863
You're not ready to lead
these men into battle.

00:36.759 --> 00:37.657
The Pharaoh is dead.

00:37.658 --> 00:41.687
When we ride into Thebes,
the glory will be yours.

00:41.689 --> 00:44.586
Why weren't you by his side
to protect him?

00:44.588 --> 00:47.923
I was, but battles
are not fought without chaos.

00:48.752 --> 00:51.415
(Horemheb)
when I returned to where he had fallen,

00:51.418 --> 00:52.349
The body was gone.

00:52.350 --> 00:53.349
(Tut) I cannot be found.

00:53.350 --> 00:54.682
Why do they want you dead?

00:54.684 --> 00:55.981
You're just a soldier.

00:55.982 --> 00:56.880
It's you.

00:56.881 --> 00:58.580
(Horemheb)
There's talk of an illness.

00:58.581 --> 01:00.812
People are sick and dying
with no cure.

01:00.814 --> 01:03.477
The next army to advance
will be ours.

01:03.478 --> 01:05.609
We will have opportunity again

01:05.611 --> 01:09.041
To make our own history
and defy their history

01:09.043 --> 01:10.174
And claim for ourselves

01:10.176 --> 01:13.577
What others believe
to be rightfully theirs.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.864
I see him.

02:39.866 --> 02:44.496
I hear...
I hear his voice.

02:44.498 --> 02:50.258
He was my brother,
above all else.

02:50.261 --> 02:53.059
And I loved him.

02:53.061 --> 02:54.924
So did I.

02:54.925 --> 02:57.124
But we've mourned,
and because of that,

02:57.125 --> 03:00.887
Anubis has freed us
to live our lives.

03:00.889 --> 03:03.986
Do we deserve it?

03:03.988 --> 03:07.084
I wished for so many years

03:07.086 --> 03:10.916
That we could be married.

03:10.918 --> 03:12.982
But I never wished him dead.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.451
The gods wished it.

03:28.243 --> 03:32.078
It's okay that
you still mourn him.

03:33.941 --> 03:37.476
We are with child.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.896
I have told no one else.

04:11.490 --> 04:16.526
We will have a new dynasty
that will last 1,000 years.

06:50.015 --> 06:53.911
Hail to Thee, Amun-Ra.

06:53.912 --> 06:57.141
The Oldest Existence.

06:57.144 --> 07:00.507
Ancient Heaven.

07:00.509 --> 07:03.706
Support of All Things.

07:03.707 --> 07:05.538
Lord of Truth.

07:05.540 --> 07:10.469
Maker of All Things
Above and Below.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.669
Arch God.

07:11.670 --> 07:17.099
Deliverer of the Sufferer
and the Oppressed.

07:17.102 --> 07:19.266
Judge of the Poor.

07:19.268 --> 07:20.665
Lord of Wisdom.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.364
Lord of Mercy.

07:22.365 --> 07:23.897
Source of Joy,

07:23.899 --> 07:27.428
Whom the very Gods Rejoice.

07:27.429 --> 07:31.459
Most Loving
Opener of Every Eye.

07:31.461 --> 07:35.690
Maker of Men and Beasts
and Herbs.

07:35.693 --> 07:39.756
The Spirits Thou hast made
extol Thee,

07:39.758 --> 07:42.488
Saying, welcome to Thee,

07:42.489 --> 07:45.952
Father of the Fathers
of the Gods.

07:45.954 --> 07:50.490
We worship the spirits
that reign within us.

07:55.983 --> 07:57.281
God of Gods,

07:57.282 --> 08:01.612
King of Kings,

08:01.614 --> 08:04.177
He has risen.

08:04.179 --> 08:05.444
God of God,

08:05.445 --> 08:07.176
King of Kings,

08:07.177 --> 08:09.740
He has risen again.

08:09.742 --> 08:12.710
(Ankhe) Brother.

08:20.605 --> 08:23.405
My friend, you still breathe.

08:25.668 --> 08:28.302
My heart swells.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.796
The celebration is yours.

08:35.797 --> 08:37.663
It is your rightful place.

09:16.844 --> 09:18.743
You are a betrayer.

09:34.535 --> 09:39.065
Fate is not what you are given.

09:39.067 --> 09:42.064
It is what you take.

09:42.066 --> 09:44.767
- [groans]
- [gasps]

09:48.863 --> 09:49.962
(Ankhe) God!

12:12.394 --> 12:15.791
My people!
I stand before you,

12:15.793 --> 12:21.196
Nesubity Nebkhepepure
Tutankhamun Hekaiunushema.

12:22.224 --> 12:27.319
He who wears the crown
and the ruler of all of Egypt.

12:27.321 --> 12:31.484
I have returned to you.

12:31.486 --> 12:33.753
I am your Pharaoh!

13:03.670 --> 13:07.472
Please, let me remove
your clothes.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.150
I cannot remember
a day in my life

13:39.153 --> 13:41.818
That you did not know
every secret in the kingdom.

13:41.819 --> 13:44.383
You give me too much credit,
my Lord.

13:44.385 --> 13:46.318
I give you none.

13:48.948 --> 13:50.181
Enough.

13:51.979 --> 13:56.842
General Horemheb's deceit
is not a revelation.

13:56.845 --> 13:59.642
But if I could not
trust my closest friend,

13:59.644 --> 14:01.741
How can I trust anyone
who serves me?

14:01.742 --> 14:04.972
Do not count them
as those who serve you.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.038
They served only their ambition.

14:07.039 --> 14:08.904
Ka was obviously taken
with the promises

14:08.906 --> 14:13.302
of general Horemheb
and his own desire,

14:13.304 --> 14:14.601
which was no secret to anyone.

14:14.602 --> 14:17.666
One you were all too ready
to see consummated.

14:17.668 --> 14:20.402
It was the queen's decision,
my Lord.

14:23.232 --> 14:26.630
I did propose a union
between myself and her

14:26.631 --> 14:29.361
To keep Ka and Horemheb
from seizing power,

14:29.363 --> 14:30.727
But she would not be deterred.

14:30.728 --> 14:34.263
In fact, she was determined
to act quickly.

14:37.125 --> 14:41.388
Then tell me, vizier...

14:41.390 --> 14:44.520
Whom can I trust?

14:44.522 --> 14:46.755
No one.

14:50.153 --> 14:51.051
Out!

14:51.052 --> 14:53.385
All of you!

14:57.949 --> 15:00.150
And you.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.373
Enough.

15:20.571 --> 15:21.237
Enough.

15:21.238 --> 15:23.872
He could not have done it.

15:27.168 --> 15:28.700
He could not have done it!

15:28.701 --> 15:32.197
He stood by the general
as I lay there bleeding.

15:32.199 --> 15:35.396
He walked away,
and he left me to die!

15:35.398 --> 15:36.829
You were badly injured.

15:36.831 --> 15:38.562
You weren't of sound mind.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.827
I was of sight!

15:40.828 --> 15:42.826
No.

15:42.828 --> 15:44.792
No.

15:44.793 --> 15:47.124
He was my brother

15:47.126 --> 15:50.888
As much as any man
who shared my blood.

15:50.889 --> 15:53.887
And he left me to rot.

15:53.890 --> 15:57.053
And then he tried to claim
what is mine.

15:57.055 --> 15:57.819
You're wrong.

15:57.820 --> 16:04.116
Ka was the most
noble man I knew.

16:04.118 --> 16:06.115
He was a pawn.

16:06.116 --> 16:08.346
The general used him

16:08.348 --> 16:11.212
And manipulated him.

16:11.215 --> 16:15.112
Maybe it was you
who was the pawn.

16:15.113 --> 16:18.142
Or maybe you both conspired
against me.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.578
Is that what you see?

16:24.774 --> 16:27.638
He is a part of me, brother.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.873
Forever.

16:31.939 --> 16:35.807
I will never forgive you.

16:49.228 --> 16:51.759
Were you so afraid
of Osirisâ€™s wrath

16:51.762 --> 16:55.592
That you lacked the courage
to do it yourself?

16:55.594 --> 16:59.062
Even I fear the gods.

17:01.191 --> 17:03.022
But you did not fear me.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.752
No one fears you.

17:05.755 --> 17:10.550
You are the boy king
that lives behind other men.

17:10.554 --> 17:12.983
What I did,
I did for the kingdom,

17:12.984 --> 17:16.115
And that was my duty.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.482
No.

17:17.483 --> 17:18.647
You betrayed your duty.

17:18.648 --> 17:21.279
And in your arrogance,
you betrayed Egypt,

17:21.281 --> 17:22.212
Not just me.

17:22.213 --> 17:23.811
Now we are without
a great general,

17:23.813 --> 17:26.376
Crippling this kingdom
that you claim to love.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.343
Now our enemies our fearless.

17:28.345 --> 17:31.275
People think you are risen
from the dead.

17:31.277 --> 17:33.608
But I have risen.

17:33.609 --> 17:35.406
From the place
where you left me to die.

17:35.408 --> 17:39.137
When you did that,
you sealed your own fate.

17:39.138 --> 17:41.236
The Mitanni are still a threat.

17:41.238 --> 17:44.401
You cannot defeat them
without me.

17:44.402 --> 17:46.369
I will have to.

17:48.169 --> 17:51.599
You're going to die, general.

17:51.601 --> 17:53.267
It will not wait.

18:05.327 --> 18:08.890
Why hasn't his body
been made ready for burial?

18:08.892 --> 18:10.223
Orders from the vizier.

18:10.225 --> 18:13.088
The body is to be entombed
without ceremony.

18:13.089 --> 18:16.223
It is the Pharaoh's wish.

18:19.487 --> 18:20.651
Leave me.

18:20.652 --> 18:22.619
My queen...

18:25.017 --> 18:26.049
Go, Sete.

18:26.051 --> 18:28.318
Thank you.

19:09.930 --> 19:13.498
What will I tell our child?

19:21.057 --> 19:24.053
This was not the way.

19:24.056 --> 19:27.320
You've betrayed us both.

19:27.321 --> 19:30.389
[crying] this was not the way.

19:54.209 --> 19:56.739
Why have I been brought here?

19:56.740 --> 20:00.669
Because I intend to
make you my wife.

20:00.671 --> 20:03.801
You have a wife.

20:03.804 --> 20:05.935
A queen.

20:05.936 --> 20:08.570
Who does not have my heart.

20:12.099 --> 20:15.200
And do I not have say
in being made your wife?

20:21.129 --> 20:23.792
I know this will be
difficult at first.

20:23.794 --> 20:27.891
But you have healed more
than just my wounds.

20:27.893 --> 20:32.055
You are here
because I want you with me.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.388
Even though I'm part Mitanni?

20:33.390 --> 20:36.320
This does not matter.
You're an Egyptian, as well.

20:36.321 --> 20:40.017
That's not how
others will see me.

20:40.020 --> 20:43.588
Out there, we were neither.

20:45.551 --> 20:48.448
Suhad, I am bound
to my life here.

20:48.450 --> 20:53.378
My customs, my people,
my duty, and yes...

20:53.380 --> 20:56.177
The queen.

20:56.178 --> 20:57.610
I want to give you this world,

20:57.612 --> 21:00.145
But I will not force you
to take it.

21:12.805 --> 21:16.134
These men are stronger
and more resistant

21:16.135 --> 21:19.904
Than any others, yet
even they have succumbed to it.

21:23.166 --> 21:26.230
In your absence,
it has spread throughout Thebes.

21:26.231 --> 21:31.992
This disease cares little for
uniform, position, or wealth.

21:31.995 --> 21:33.260
Keep the men in the barracks.

21:33.261 --> 21:36.325
Quarantine any
who show symptoms.

21:36.326 --> 21:38.626
Yes, my Lord.

21:41.724 --> 21:46.520
Their commander has been
arrested and is to be executed.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.553
Ka was their friend
and their battle mate.

21:48.554 --> 21:53.516
These men, they ask nothing
and say nothing.

21:53.518 --> 21:57.214
Death comes easily
in their world.

21:57.217 --> 22:01.913
It is not for them to question.

22:01.915 --> 22:04.412
But there are others in uniform

22:04.413 --> 22:06.710
Who don't share
the same sentiment.

22:06.712 --> 22:11.075
That'll spread more rapidly
than this disease

22:11.077 --> 22:13.678
When the general is executed.

22:15.974 --> 22:17.939
The man must die, my Lord.

22:17.941 --> 22:21.270
But...

22:21.272 --> 22:23.703
A public display

22:23.704 --> 22:26.733
May fan unnecessary flames.

22:26.735 --> 22:32.198
Every Egyptian will know
the price of treason.

22:32.200 --> 22:34.864
Any flames that are fanned
will be extinguished

22:34.866 --> 22:37.567
With his last breath.

22:56.988 --> 23:02.516
My Lord, our scouts report
no movement from the Mitanni.

23:02.518 --> 23:05.482
Perhaps a reprieve
for the moment.

23:05.484 --> 23:07.449
Good.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.716
Come. Sit.

23:12.314 --> 23:14.648
Tend to him.

23:20.378 --> 23:22.908
They have not been idle.

23:22.909 --> 23:25.640
They continue
to rebuild their army.

23:25.642 --> 23:26.473
Draw allies.

23:26.474 --> 23:30.609
While mine is weakened
by this illness.

23:32.971 --> 23:34.270
I'm sorry.

23:34.271 --> 23:37.138
No.
There's no need to be.

23:45.099 --> 23:49.601
As you said,
perhaps a momentary reprieve.

24:24.046 --> 24:27.276
It's been well dressed.

24:27.278 --> 24:31.007
For a village girl.

24:31.010 --> 24:34.241
Her name is Suhad.

24:34.243 --> 24:35.608
She knows more about this world

24:35.609 --> 24:38.406
Than most of the people
in this palace.

24:38.407 --> 24:43.535
The people beyond these walls
are more than mere peasants.

24:43.537 --> 24:46.433
She's still a peasant.

24:46.435 --> 24:48.600
And Mitanni.

24:48.601 --> 24:50.267
She's mine.

24:53.099 --> 24:54.197
What did you say?

24:54.199 --> 24:55.065
She's mine.

24:55.066 --> 24:56.197
She is not your queen.

24:56.198 --> 24:58.229
She is not the one
that you married

24:58.230 --> 25:02.332
So that we would have a child
in our father's name.

25:07.092 --> 25:09.960
We have a duty to this kingdom.

25:14.124 --> 25:17.320
Ankhesenamun.

25:17.321 --> 25:20.122
Leave her be.

25:52.437 --> 25:55.705
Our great Pharaoh.

25:57.668 --> 25:58.867
Rise.

25:58.869 --> 26:01.532
The gods welcome you to prayer.

26:01.533 --> 26:06.129
You have served my kingdom well,
high priest.

26:06.132 --> 26:08.396
The gods have shown favor.

26:08.398 --> 26:11.428
But from this day forward,
prayer and sacrifice

26:11.429 --> 26:14.226
Will honor them sufficiently.

26:14.228 --> 26:17.092
I'm not sure I understand
your meaning, my Lord.

26:17.093 --> 26:20.023
My people will no longer be
forced to pay tribute.

26:20.025 --> 26:22.755
They will do so
at their own choosing.

26:22.757 --> 26:24.855
But it's the law.

26:24.856 --> 26:27.286
I am the law.

26:27.288 --> 26:29.819
Orchards and fields prosper.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.918
Workshops are productive.
The gods are pleased.

26:31.919 --> 26:38.280
Without proper tribute, their
wrath will cause great harm

26:38.283 --> 26:39.914
To your people.

26:39.915 --> 26:44.610
Then it may be time to
reconsider what gods we worship.

26:44.613 --> 26:45.245
My Lord.

26:45.246 --> 26:47.610
Your priests are devoted to you.

26:47.612 --> 26:49.344
They will do
as you command them.

26:49.345 --> 26:52.379
See that it is done,
high priest.

27:02.339 --> 27:04.906
That will be all, vizier.

27:33.090 --> 27:36.787
Why did you travel to Thebes
with the Pharaoh?

27:36.789 --> 27:39.086
I'm his guest.

27:39.087 --> 27:41.484
And I am the queen of Egypt.

27:41.486 --> 27:45.382
You will address me
in the proper manner.

27:45.384 --> 27:48.152
I-i apologize, my queen.

27:51.449 --> 27:53.879
Where did he find you?

27:53.880 --> 27:56.210
He didn't.
I found him.

27:56.212 --> 27:58.877
He was dying.
I brought him back to health.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.878
And brought him back to me.

28:11.772 --> 28:14.269
She's not just
another harem girl.

28:14.270 --> 28:15.036
No.

28:15.037 --> 28:16.267
And if she bears him a child,

28:16.269 --> 28:19.100
He will remove you
from position.

28:19.101 --> 28:22.698
A childless queen
eventually becomes insignificant

28:22.701 --> 28:23.931
To any Pharaoh.

28:23.932 --> 28:25.830
I am his blood.

28:25.832 --> 28:29.095
My child will always be
his first choice for the throne.

28:29.096 --> 28:31.927
And yet the gods continue
to deny you.

28:31.929 --> 28:34.027
I have prayed to Tawaret,

28:34.028 --> 28:37.624
And I'm confident
she's heard me.

28:37.626 --> 28:40.227
And if she hasn't?

28:41.592 --> 28:44.389
The girl is from Amurru.

28:44.390 --> 28:49.318
With a Mitanni name, she's not
even of pure Egyptian blood.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.318
And there cannot be
a Mitanni heir.

28:51.320 --> 28:54.217
You must have a son
by any means.

28:54.218 --> 28:57.319
Is that another proposal?

28:59.149 --> 29:02.179
It's a consideration.

29:02.181 --> 29:04.982
I will have his child.

29:13.342 --> 29:16.739
I'm sorry, vizier,
can I speak to you?

29:16.741 --> 29:18.273
I didn't know who could help.

29:18.275 --> 29:20.838
Then I'm pleased
you came to me.

29:20.840 --> 29:24.869
My mother and father haven't
heard from me since I left.

29:24.870 --> 29:25.835
I'd like them...

29:25.837 --> 29:27.868
To know you're well?

29:27.869 --> 29:30.200
Yes.
In truth...

29:30.202 --> 29:32.598
You'd like them to
come here to Thebes.

29:32.599 --> 29:34.131
To see the Pharaoh.

29:34.132 --> 29:35.863
To see your place with him.

29:35.865 --> 29:37.962
I would just like to
see them, vizier.

29:37.964 --> 29:40.928
And this has been discussed
with the Pharaoh?

29:40.930 --> 29:43.860
I didn't want to burden him.

29:43.861 --> 29:47.997
I'm told you make most
of the decisions here.

29:50.858 --> 29:53.555
Is that not true?

29:53.556 --> 29:56.419
I can see why
he's taken with you.

29:56.422 --> 30:00.458
Be sure, few in this world
make decisions on their own.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.617
Word will be sent
to your parents.

30:05.619 --> 30:08.880
Should they inquire
in the meantime,

30:08.881 --> 30:11.546
They will be made welcome.

30:11.548 --> 30:14.682
[dramatic music]

31:29.477 --> 31:32.474
What is it?

31:32.476 --> 31:34.608
My people think

31:34.610 --> 31:38.772
That their Pharaoh
is invincible.

31:38.774 --> 31:40.371
A living god.

31:40.372 --> 31:44.602
Instead he is the target of more
enemies than he has friends.

31:44.604 --> 31:48.800
Your vulnerability
is what gives you strength.

31:48.802 --> 31:51.799
Not enough.

31:51.801 --> 31:55.064
You told me at the pyramids
you want to be remembered

31:55.066 --> 31:57.597
As a great Pharaoh.

31:57.598 --> 32:01.294
Greatness cannot only be seen
in the eyes of your people,

32:01.296 --> 32:05.092
But in the eyes
of your enemies as well.

32:05.094 --> 32:08.491
From an enemy who will not
see it.

32:08.493 --> 32:10.823
Then offer the Mitanni
something.

32:10.825 --> 32:16.220
Bridge your differences
and turn them into an ally.

32:16.222 --> 32:18.686
That, my Pharaoh,

32:18.688 --> 32:22.890
Would be a measure
of great strength.

32:33.315 --> 32:35.878
I cannot fight a war
against an army that size

32:35.879 --> 32:39.442
While half of mine succumbs
to illness.

32:39.444 --> 32:41.708
This could avoid annihilation.

32:41.709 --> 32:47.480
You want an alliance with
the Mitanni, our sworn enemy?

32:48.506 --> 32:51.204
King Tushratta has
an unwed son.

32:51.206 --> 32:55.102
Herit will become
a powerful queen and ally.

32:55.104 --> 32:58.866
What inspired this idea?

32:58.868 --> 33:01.133
I know this is done
with great sacrifice to you.

33:01.134 --> 33:05.030
She's your favorite
of our cousins.

33:05.032 --> 33:10.593
We have always sacrificed
what we hold dear, brother.

33:10.596 --> 33:13.261
Our own deepest desires
were the only things

33:13.263 --> 33:16.397
We were denied
at birth, aren't they?

33:19.626 --> 33:24.529
Through it all,
only you and I know this.

33:28.988 --> 33:32.918
And above all else,

33:32.920 --> 33:35.454
We only have each other.

33:56.342 --> 33:59.443
(Ankhe)
it wasn't my choice, herit.

34:04.537 --> 34:07.267
But as shared blood,
if successful,

34:07.270 --> 34:10.167
We will be united forever.

34:10.168 --> 34:15.771
And our children will hold dear
that kindred bond.

34:17.965 --> 34:21.228
And as their mothers,

34:21.230 --> 34:24.764
We will have great power.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.496
Then the decision is made.

34:33.058 --> 34:38.253
The overture has already been
sent to the Mitanni king.

34:38.255 --> 34:39.886
And you?

34:39.887 --> 34:42.083
Are you going to be all right?

34:42.085 --> 34:44.916
No one else knows
you are with child.

34:44.918 --> 34:47.583
Pharaoh understands
his duty to me.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.181
I will be sure
he thinks it is his.

34:50.181 --> 34:54.518
And when this business of men
is settled...

34:57.012 --> 35:00.747
We will be together again.

35:17.070 --> 35:18.903
Good-bye, cousin.

35:39.792 --> 35:42.689
Not only does Suhad have
his heart,

35:42.691 --> 35:45.025
She has his ear.

35:46.223 --> 35:50.985
I fear she counsels him
to the benefit of the enemy.

35:50.987 --> 35:51.985
What can be done?

35:51.986 --> 35:57.115
All enemies are vulnerable
when given false trust.

35:57.117 --> 36:01.052
Perhaps you should avail
yourself to such an advantage.

36:19.174 --> 36:20.372
It's a foot game.

36:20.374 --> 36:21.439
A game of balance, really.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.037
You have to hop on one foot.

36:23.038 --> 36:24.236
There's colored dice
that determine

36:24.238 --> 36:26.103
Which marker to step on.

36:26.104 --> 36:28.301
I played a similar one
when I was a girl.

36:28.302 --> 36:29.434
I haven't seen this pattern.

36:29.436 --> 36:34.298
You're the one that came back
with the Pharaoh.

36:34.300 --> 36:37.297
I'm the vizier's son.
Nahkt.

36:37.298 --> 36:39.628
Welcome.

36:39.631 --> 36:43.327
That's the first
sincere greeting i've received.

36:43.328 --> 36:45.859
I'm Suhad.

36:45.861 --> 36:49.924
Do you want me to teach you
the rules, Suhad?

36:49.926 --> 36:52.293
Another time.

36:57.288 --> 37:00.818
Would you leave us, please?

37:00.821 --> 37:02.352
It was nice to meet you.

37:02.353 --> 37:04.186
And you.

37:10.848 --> 37:13.546
I've asked for more
to be carved.

37:13.548 --> 37:15.179
We are Egyptians here,

37:15.180 --> 37:19.742
Looked upon with envy
for our great temples,

37:19.745 --> 37:22.109
Our art,

37:22.110 --> 37:24.574
But most of all,

37:24.576 --> 37:27.407
Our happiness.

37:27.408 --> 37:30.976
I hope you'll find it here.

37:34.937 --> 37:39.832
Even if I become
the Pharaoh's wife?

37:39.835 --> 37:41.902
Second wife.

38:29.045 --> 38:31.476
Sparse for such an event.

38:31.477 --> 38:36.713
The general is still considered
a hero amongst many, my Lord.

39:15.724 --> 39:16.921
Your army awaits.

39:16.923 --> 39:18.889
Only if we reach them first.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.113
The general is gone.

39:50.872 --> 39:53.104
Is there time to
cut off his escape?

39:53.106 --> 39:55.573
Escape is not his intent.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.279
Your men followed you into this.

40:45.280 --> 40:48.777
They will follow you out.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.576
Surrender now,

40:51.578 --> 40:54.346
And they will be forgiven.

41:00.674 --> 41:04.369
Set down your weapons.

41:04.370 --> 41:06.801
Honor your word to these men.

41:06.803 --> 41:10.433
And do with me what you wish.

41:10.436 --> 41:13.237
I will never serve this Pharaoh.

41:19.563 --> 41:20.995
Enough!

41:20.997 --> 41:24.232
Put your weapons down.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.289
You chose your side wisely,
lagus.

41:35.291 --> 41:40.419
There should never have been
a side, general.

41:40.421 --> 41:42.688
I once learned that from you.

41:55.947 --> 42:00.409
I am guilty once again.

42:00.411 --> 42:01.676
No.

42:01.677 --> 42:07.106
There is no guilt, general.

42:07.109 --> 42:08.773
No innocence.

42:08.774 --> 42:12.943
Only what serves
the Pharaoh's purpose.

42:50.154 --> 42:52.355
Herit.

43:01.382 --> 43:04.346
The man conspired against you,
against his own kingdom.

43:04.349 --> 43:07.079
And he'll still die for it.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.477
You know what we're up against.
I haven't a choice.

43:09.479 --> 43:10.611
He can't be trusted.

43:10.612 --> 43:12.775
The general's actions
are treasonous.

43:12.776 --> 43:15.110
If I may...

43:17.641 --> 43:22.769
As I said before, in his mind,
it's always been for Egypt.

43:22.772 --> 43:26.169
Every man in the army
would agree with that.

43:26.171 --> 43:29.034
That's why he's loved by them.

43:29.036 --> 43:30.734
It's why they will die for him.

43:30.735 --> 43:33.132
All ambitious men would have
you think so.

43:33.134 --> 43:34.666
With all due respect,
that's a tactic

43:34.667 --> 43:36.731
Many who advise the Pharaoh
know too well.

43:36.732 --> 43:40.062
While others have yet to prove
which side they stand.

43:40.064 --> 43:42.162
Enough, both of you.

43:42.164 --> 43:45.893
No one in this room
has to prove anything.

43:45.895 --> 43:49.557
Ay, you will allow him to speak.

43:49.559 --> 43:54.455
He sees the Mitanni
as his greatest enemy.

43:54.457 --> 43:56.355
You were in his way, my Lord.

43:56.356 --> 43:58.420
That is why he made his move
against you.

43:58.422 --> 44:03.418
So am I to forgive him
for being a loyal Egyptian?

44:03.421 --> 44:04.618
No.

44:04.619 --> 44:06.917
The vizier is right.

44:06.918 --> 44:09.015
Treason is treason.

44:09.017 --> 44:13.119
But there's a far greater enemy
to be fought right now.

44:14.614 --> 44:18.643
There is no one they fear
more than general Horemheb.

44:18.645 --> 44:20.677
Let him think
you have his trust

44:20.679 --> 44:23.942
So that he will fight
the Mitanni alongside you.

44:23.944 --> 44:27.440
When it's over,
when there's a clear victory,

44:27.442 --> 44:29.943
Then decide his fate.

44:33.638 --> 44:36.369
I never would have thought
that they are capable

44:36.370 --> 44:38.501
Of something so horrible.

44:38.503 --> 44:40.201
They are Mitanni.

44:40.203 --> 44:41.535
It comes naturally.

44:48.898 --> 44:50.229
Where's Ankhesenamun?

44:50.230 --> 44:52.297
She's being attended to.

45:25.181 --> 45:28.882
We have suffered too much loss.

45:32.677 --> 45:37.713
I am the one who has suffered
the losses, brother.

45:45.404 --> 45:48.135
How much more
do I have to endure?

45:48.137 --> 45:50.367
You're distraught.

45:50.368 --> 45:51.367
You need rest.

45:51.369 --> 45:54.432
What I need is to know
that these sacrifices

45:54.433 --> 45:57.097
Haven't been made
without purpose.

45:57.100 --> 46:01.862
We were married so that
we would have a child

46:01.864 --> 46:05.460
In our father's name.

46:05.461 --> 46:07.795
Please.

46:09.393 --> 46:12.227
Let's try once more.

46:17.157 --> 46:19.357
No.

46:21.054 --> 46:25.518
Do not prove our father right.

46:25.520 --> 46:29.855
He never believed
you could be a great Pharaoh.

46:30.883 --> 46:34.584
But you have shown
yourself opposite.

46:36.647 --> 46:38.945
Do not let this girl
cloud your mind

46:38.946 --> 46:43.916
After everything... everything
that we've been through.

46:45.942 --> 46:47.707
She is Mitanni.

46:47.708 --> 46:50.538
Do not disregard
our forefathers.

46:50.540 --> 46:55.136
You preach duty and oath
to general Horemheb and his men.

46:55.139 --> 46:58.569
This is your duty!

46:58.570 --> 47:01.967
This...

47:01.969 --> 47:03.468
Is your oath.

47:58.707 --> 48:01.174
It was not intended.

48:06.404 --> 48:08.804
But inevitable.

48:12.069 --> 48:15.065
Do you love her?

48:15.067 --> 48:16.665
I will always
have love for her.

48:16.666 --> 48:18.731
You know what I'm asking.

48:18.732 --> 48:21.894
I cannot ignore who I am.

48:21.896 --> 48:23.527
I accept you are
Pharaoh of Egypt,

48:23.528 --> 48:27.158
But I cannot make a life here
without knowing my place.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.458
I'm bound to obligations

48:29.461 --> 48:32.225
That have been handed to me
by the gods.

48:32.226 --> 48:33.490
If I do not have an heir,

48:33.491 --> 48:38.619
I will have failed everyone
who's come before me.

48:38.621 --> 48:40.686
Must the child be hers?

48:40.688 --> 48:42.855
No.

48:44.853 --> 48:49.182
What is it?

48:49.185 --> 48:51.083
You were forced to marry her.

48:51.084 --> 48:54.346
You are not in love.

48:54.348 --> 48:56.512
I would think a child
born of passion

48:56.513 --> 49:01.742
Would be your choice
as heir to your kingdom.

49:01.744 --> 49:05.240
My sister's blood is pure.

49:05.242 --> 49:09.771
I would be obligated to choose
a son from her womb,

49:09.774 --> 49:12.075
And she would remain my queen.

49:16.172 --> 49:17.504
I'm sorry.

49:55.852 --> 50:01.956
This sword was given to me
by Ka when we were children.

50:03.616 --> 50:07.084
It was his father's.

50:17.108 --> 50:20.505
Was there at least
hesitation in his deceit?

50:20.507 --> 50:23.470
No man is made of only vice.

50:23.472 --> 50:27.241
We all walk in the shadow
between light and dark.

50:30.835 --> 50:33.102
Even you?

50:41.330 --> 50:44.093
The Mitanni's message
is clear.

50:44.096 --> 50:45.561
Once his allies are in place,

50:45.562 --> 50:47.193
Tushratta will move against us.

50:47.195 --> 50:49.792
I do not pretend I can fight
this battle alone.

50:49.793 --> 50:53.356
It seems
we've been here before.

50:53.358 --> 50:55.456
Disease plagues the cities.

50:55.457 --> 50:57.755
It's ravaged the army.

50:57.757 --> 50:59.787
The men are divided.
Our enemy is not.

50:59.788 --> 51:02.551
Because we did not continue
our march on their capital

51:02.554 --> 51:03.819
As I demanded.

51:03.820 --> 51:04.985
It was a trap.

51:04.986 --> 51:06.917
One I would have overcome.

51:06.919 --> 51:10.287
Like you did here?

51:11.650 --> 51:14.546
I will not absolve you
of your crimes.

51:14.547 --> 51:17.379
But I will give you
the opportunity to clear them

51:17.381 --> 51:19.078
From your conscience.

51:19.079 --> 51:21.110
So I help lead us to victory,

51:21.111 --> 51:23.608
And my reward is
the sharp end of a blade?

51:23.611 --> 51:26.375
Your reward is knowing
that you are not responsible

51:26.377 --> 51:28.241
For the fall of Egypt.

51:28.242 --> 51:30.872
And after all this is over,

51:30.873 --> 51:35.169
You expect me to
accept death so easily?

51:35.171 --> 51:38.668
You are not afraid of death,
general.

51:38.670 --> 51:41.604
You only fear the loss
of your reputation.

51:57.394 --> 52:00.124
We both think we know
how this is going to end,

52:00.126 --> 52:01.925
And one of us is wrong.

52:01.927 --> 52:04.857
Until then, we set it aside.

52:04.858 --> 52:07.792
I know there is honor enough
in you for that.

52:44.905 --> 52:49.774
Your greatness,
the queen seeks your audience.

52:55.601 --> 52:59.703
My lady, the gods delight
in your presence.

53:06.895 --> 53:10.692
I have brought two children
into this world without breath.

53:10.694 --> 53:12.591
We have prayed to Tawaret
many times.

53:12.592 --> 53:16.754
And yet they haven't answered
to my satisfaction.

53:16.757 --> 53:19.155
I fear the gods
do not favor me.

53:19.156 --> 53:22.185
A future king is to be
the reincarnation

53:22.187 --> 53:23.819
Of a god on this earth,

53:23.820 --> 53:27.488
Conceived by
the gods themselves.

53:28.850 --> 53:32.919
And yet we both know that's
only for the people to hear.

53:36.548 --> 53:40.710
You are the vessel
for whom the gods speak.

53:40.712 --> 53:42.510
Will Amun-ra give me a son?

53:42.511 --> 53:44.709
I can grant you
deliverance of his heir

53:44.711 --> 53:50.406
If, as Pharaoh, he will love
the gods and their temples.

53:50.408 --> 53:52.905
I would have it no other way.

53:52.906 --> 53:56.569
Then let us pray together.

53:56.572 --> 54:00.974
And you will soon
give birth to a god.

54:03.634 --> 54:06.298
Organize the men.
I want numbers.

54:06.300 --> 54:09.696
Recruit as many citizens as
you can by the Pharaoh's order.

54:09.698 --> 54:12.728
And send the scout directly
to me first when he returns.

54:12.729 --> 54:14.794
What about those who stood by
the Pharaoh?

54:14.797 --> 54:16.428
They should be commended.

54:16.429 --> 54:19.393
The Pharaoh doesn't intend
the same for us.

54:19.395 --> 54:21.425
I'll deal with that
when the war is over.

54:21.426 --> 54:23.723
First, we unite the army

54:23.724 --> 54:26.821
And defeat the Mitanni dog
and his son.

54:26.823 --> 54:31.326
For now,
i am going to get drunk.

54:32.853 --> 54:35.650
Then I'm going to get stiff.

54:35.653 --> 54:39.321
And it has been far too long
for both.

54:48.246 --> 54:50.876
This has been crafted
over many years.

54:50.878 --> 54:54.775
And many years
before it is needed.

54:54.778 --> 54:59.007
Death awaits us all.

54:59.009 --> 55:01.506
Tushratta is waiting
for a response to his killing

55:01.507 --> 55:04.237
Of herit so he can gauge
the strength of our army.

55:04.239 --> 55:07.336
If we do nothing,
he'll know that we are weak.

55:07.337 --> 55:08.469
At the moment, we are.

55:08.471 --> 55:12.200
We can't allow him
to know that.

55:12.202 --> 55:14.733
We're running out of options,
vizier.

55:14.735 --> 55:17.165
Even if we return
to full strength,

55:17.166 --> 55:18.731
We are outnumbered.

55:18.733 --> 55:20.963
And there are no more men
to recruit.

55:20.964 --> 55:25.493
More and more of my people
succumb to this illness.

55:25.495 --> 55:29.330
Soon, we will have to close
the gate to all outsiders.

55:45.586 --> 55:48.087
Call for my physician.

55:52.550 --> 55:55.518
It's not the illness
that makes me faint.

56:03.478 --> 56:05.975
Glorious goddess,

56:05.976 --> 56:09.206
Love this embodiment of you.

56:09.209 --> 56:13.937
We open our hearts
to your mysteries.

56:13.939 --> 56:15.670
Choose her.

56:15.671 --> 56:18.802
Bless her as mother.

56:18.804 --> 56:22.205
May your son live
for 1,000 years.

56:35.795 --> 56:38.259
(Tis'ata)
we returned his own cousin on a spear,

56:38.261 --> 56:41.225
And they haven't lifted
a single dagger in response

56:41.226 --> 56:42.357
To their gift.

56:42.359 --> 56:44.389
They have no ability to fight.

56:44.390 --> 56:45.755
And as the illness
continues to spread,

56:45.756 --> 56:48.287
It will further weaken
their ranks,

56:48.290 --> 56:50.155
Giving us opportunity
to take the north

56:50.156 --> 56:53.053
Without shedding
unnecessary blood.

56:53.055 --> 56:54.319
Our entire force
will then be able

56:54.320 --> 56:55.952
To take the rest of the nile
to its end.

56:55.953 --> 57:00.055
And how do we conquer northern
Egypt without shedding blood?

57:05.747 --> 57:08.277
I have been given a strong son,

57:08.280 --> 57:12.210
Eager for battle and victory
so that we are the first

57:12.212 --> 57:14.043
Since Teshub created
the great storm

57:14.044 --> 57:16.075
That carved our world

57:16.076 --> 57:20.438
To occupy the mighty
Egyptian empire.

57:20.440 --> 57:22.472
But first,

57:22.474 --> 57:25.304
Learn from my countenance.

57:25.305 --> 57:27.036
My liege.

57:27.039 --> 57:28.903
They have arrived.

57:28.904 --> 57:31.104
All of them.

57:37.067 --> 57:43.638
Egypt and its boy king are about
to be wiped from history.

57:54.292 --> 57:57.588
(Amun)
the queen has already lost two sons at birth.

57:57.590 --> 58:00.454
Perhaps this time,
the gods will reward her

58:00.455 --> 58:03.418
Despite the Pharaoh's
lack of devotion.

58:03.420 --> 58:06.317
It displeases you that
another has fallen into line.

58:06.320 --> 58:08.185
There's always another in line.

58:08.186 --> 58:09.217
One way or the other.

58:09.218 --> 58:10.916
If the gods do not favor her?

58:10.918 --> 58:13.148
The Pharaoh is still young.
I am not.

58:13.149 --> 58:15.147
Rest assured, vizier,
he is going down

58:15.148 --> 58:16.946
The same path as his father.

58:16.948 --> 58:19.745
His father made enemies
of everyone.

58:19.746 --> 58:23.575
Tutankhamun is different.
He sees all sides.

58:23.578 --> 58:27.241
Then I shall pray that Amun-ra
ensures this kingdom

58:27.243 --> 58:29.310
Its proper path.

58:41.802 --> 58:43.966
Stay close to the vizier.

58:43.968 --> 58:49.839
He, more than any one else,
must be handled carefully.

59:02.527 --> 59:05.223
Uncooked?

59:05.225 --> 59:07.492
Of course.

59:10.855 --> 59:13.823
The onion heals many illnesses.

59:16.619 --> 59:17.785
I'd rather be sick.

59:18.551 --> 59:20.948
My father insists
almost everything is cooked.

59:20.950 --> 59:25.186
I'm sure. How else would he keep
so many servants busy?

59:26.581 --> 59:28.546
That wasn't meant
to offend you.

59:28.547 --> 59:29.311
Mm.

59:29.312 --> 59:31.710
He's always taught me to be
proud that we have servants.

59:31.712 --> 59:35.308
We were not born with royal
blood but are treated the same.

59:35.310 --> 59:39.806
You speak about your father
but not your mother.

59:39.808 --> 59:42.638
She died when I was younger.

59:42.640 --> 59:44.505
I'm sorry.

59:44.507 --> 59:48.203
And your father, the vizier,
he cared for you on his own?

59:48.204 --> 59:52.199
He's not my father by blood.

59:52.201 --> 59:54.732
I didn't mean to pry.

59:54.734 --> 59:58.464
No. I don't know
why I said it.

59:58.465 --> 01:00:02.328
I've never talked about it
to anyone.

01:00:02.331 --> 01:00:05.027
My mother was with another man.

01:00:05.029 --> 01:00:07.894
My father didn't know
until years after I was born.

01:00:07.895 --> 01:00:09.859
He kept it from me,
but I found out

01:00:09.861 --> 01:00:11.592
From my grandmother.

01:00:11.593 --> 01:00:15.695
She said my father didn't
want me to think I was unwanted.

01:00:16.923 --> 01:00:21.519
He's tried to love me
the same way, but he can't.

01:00:21.522 --> 01:00:26.284
How old were you
when he found out?

01:00:26.286 --> 01:00:28.620
I don't remember.

01:00:36.481 --> 01:00:39.181
We better get back
to the palace.

01:00:40.413 --> 01:00:43.477
If this illness
passes through Thebes,

01:00:43.479 --> 01:00:47.708
It will reach the north
and every city in Egypt.

01:00:47.709 --> 01:00:51.872
This section here, where
the disease is most rampant,

01:00:51.874 --> 01:00:54.670
Is the most easily walled.

01:00:54.672 --> 01:00:55.938
How many people?

01:00:55.939 --> 01:00:58.569
Well over 1,000.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.802
What about medicines?

01:01:00.803 --> 01:01:02.768
The supplies are inadequate.

01:01:02.769 --> 01:01:05.269
Too many people are falling ill.

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:12.030
Have it done.

01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:14.527
Confine all those who are sick.

01:01:14.529 --> 01:01:20.224
Iagus, patrol the streets
with extra men.

01:01:20.227 --> 01:01:23.128
Armed.

01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:45.452
Bring me to my own chamber.

01:01:51.545 --> 01:01:56.573
You once said
you were afraid of me.

01:01:56.576 --> 01:01:58.674
Are you, son?

01:01:58.676 --> 01:02:00.008
Medicine.

01:02:00.009 --> 01:02:01.673
Please.

01:02:01.674 --> 01:02:04.937
I will get you the medicine.

01:02:04.939 --> 01:02:07.037
You'll stay here,

01:02:07.038 --> 01:02:10.306
Where the illness
can be contained.

01:02:16.201 --> 01:02:20.164
And you will learn to trust me.

01:02:20.166 --> 01:02:21.732
Yes?

01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:27.631
Yes.

01:02:49.152 --> 01:02:51.349
You still find it
uncomfortable.

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:55.479
I will always prefer
the hardness of the floor.

01:02:55.482 --> 01:02:58.278
I envy you.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.146
Envy?

01:02:59.147 --> 01:03:00.312
I was raised in a palace.

01:03:00.313 --> 01:03:03.842
My whole entire life
has been set by others,

01:03:03.844 --> 01:03:05.742
And you've been free to choose.

01:03:05.743 --> 01:03:08.873
I no longer feel quite so free.

01:03:08.875 --> 01:03:10.973
You're not.

01:03:10.974 --> 01:03:15.436
You didn't think you'd have him
all to yourself, did you?

01:03:15.439 --> 01:03:17.070
He is the Pharaoh, Suhad.

01:03:17.072 --> 01:03:20.835
Your position,
as with all women, is fleeting.

01:03:20.836 --> 01:03:23.667
At the fickle whim
of a man's cock.

01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:27.864
He may love you,
but that doesn't matter now.

01:03:27.866 --> 01:03:29.364
I am his queen,

01:03:29.365 --> 01:03:32.162
And above all else, his blood.

01:03:32.165 --> 01:03:33.031
Egyptian blood.

01:03:33.032 --> 01:03:34.763
And now, I carry his heir.

01:03:34.764 --> 01:03:37.394
The Pharaoh may have
as many wives as he wishes,

01:03:37.396 --> 01:03:40.792
As many women throughout
the empire that he desires.

01:03:40.793 --> 01:03:44.189
But there is no greater title
in all the world

01:03:44.191 --> 01:03:46.189
For a woman to hold
than the title

01:03:46.191 --> 01:03:48.988
Of the future king's mother.

01:03:48.989 --> 01:03:51.786
Well then,
i will pray this time

01:03:51.789 --> 01:03:55.357
That the gods deliver you
a child who draws breath.

01:03:56.719 --> 01:03:58.251
Heed caution, Suhad.

01:03:58.252 --> 01:04:03.015
Bearing a child in this world
is more hazardous for women

01:04:03.017 --> 01:04:05.417
Than war is for men.

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.278
He doesn't know yet,

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.513
Does he?

01:04:42.664 --> 01:04:45.928
The quarantine cannot
contain them anymore.

01:04:45.930 --> 01:04:47.094
Some have escaped.

01:04:47.095 --> 01:04:49.026
No telling how many more
they infected

01:04:49.028 --> 01:04:52.529
Before they were caught.

01:05:01.555 --> 01:05:03.586
The gods are
delivering this curse

01:05:03.587 --> 01:05:05.151
Into everything around them.

01:05:05.153 --> 01:05:07.285
It's in their clothing,
the food that they eat,

01:05:07.287 --> 01:05:10.250
Even the very walls
that confine them.

01:05:10.252 --> 01:05:13.016
(Amun)
so your answer is to burn them?

01:05:13.017 --> 01:05:16.146
It is indeed the gods who
delivered this curse upon us.

01:05:16.148 --> 01:05:19.778
But it is only they
who can deliver us from it.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.545
When?

01:05:21.546 --> 01:05:24.642
When the entire city
is infected?

01:05:24.644 --> 01:05:25.909
Half the population dead?

01:05:25.911 --> 01:05:28.542
The army further decimated?

01:05:28.543 --> 01:05:31.505
Can we not station more guards
outside the gates?

01:05:31.507 --> 01:05:32.306
Impossible.

01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:35.737
New cases continue to spread
outwards from its perimeter.

01:05:35.739 --> 01:05:39.402
This sickness grows
like a dam within those walls.

01:05:39.404 --> 01:05:42.500
Soon, it will burst forth
like a flood

01:05:42.501 --> 01:05:44.168
Through the rest of Thebes.

01:05:47.634 --> 01:05:48.665
Vizier?

01:05:48.666 --> 01:05:52.468
I'm afraid I agree
with the general.

01:05:53.097 --> 01:05:56.627
We cannot risk spreading
this disease

01:05:56.629 --> 01:06:00.164
Through the rest of our kingdom.

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:05.759
It must end here.

01:06:14.788 --> 01:06:17.455
What is your decision, my Lord?

01:06:20.718 --> 01:06:21.849
How soon can it be done?

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:26.787
It will take a few days
to secure the remaining sick.

01:06:28.814 --> 01:06:30.313
Make preparations.

01:06:30.314 --> 01:06:33.982
Word cannot leave this chamber.

01:06:38.209 --> 01:06:40.940
You will swear it, high priest.

01:06:40.942 --> 01:06:44.537
The people look to me
to be the voice of the gods.

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:48.536
If this plan is not their will,
then the people should know.

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:50.069
I am their god!

01:06:50.070 --> 01:06:51.136
I am their voice.

01:06:51.137 --> 01:06:52.601
It is my will
and therefore yours.

01:06:52.602 --> 01:06:58.064
Do not turn the people against
this palace for your own gain.

01:06:58.066 --> 01:07:00.763
As you command, my Lord.

01:07:00.765 --> 01:07:04.099
Leave me, all of you.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.413
Will this help anything?

01:07:36.414 --> 01:07:38.013
I don't think it will hurt.

01:07:38.015 --> 01:07:41.244
Made from the same seeds
Suhad traded that night.

01:07:41.246 --> 01:07:44.442
I overheard that
you requested it.

01:07:44.444 --> 01:07:47.909
They only serve me wine
in this palace.

01:07:47.911 --> 01:07:49.642
They think this is beneath me.

01:07:49.643 --> 01:07:53.205
A good beer is beneath no one.

01:07:53.207 --> 01:07:55.073
My Lord.

01:07:56.804 --> 01:08:00.635
Iagus.

01:08:00.638 --> 01:08:04.067
It seems an age ago,
that night in the alley

01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:06.733
When you came to my aid.

01:08:06.734 --> 01:08:11.296
Thank you for being
a trusted friend.

01:08:11.298 --> 01:08:13.098
A loyal servant.

01:08:14.963 --> 01:08:18.493
What I did not know that night

01:08:18.496 --> 01:08:21.591
Is that you did not
need my aid.

01:08:21.593 --> 01:08:25.462
Yes, I did, as I do now.

01:08:29.157 --> 01:08:32.892
It's not as bitter
as I remember.

01:08:59.376 --> 01:09:02.372
How long have you known
I am with child?

01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:04.639
Nearly as long as you.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.638
Men don't see things
the way we do.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:11.042
They think that bearing a child
is the work of the gods.

01:09:12.803 --> 01:09:15.633
But women know.

01:09:15.634 --> 01:09:18.663
What will be
my child's place here?

01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:22.769
He'll be the son that carries
the enemy's blood through him.

01:09:34.492 --> 01:09:36.356
The water.

01:09:36.359 --> 01:09:38.792
My queen, the water.

01:09:41.822 --> 01:09:43.921
Oh, no.
No.

01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:48.649
No!

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:50.251
This will not happen again.

01:09:51.417 --> 01:09:52.747
Come.

01:09:52.749 --> 01:09:54.182
Oh!

01:10:02.679 --> 01:10:03.179
No! No!

01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:09.807
No!

01:10:09.808 --> 01:10:12.505
Do not take him from me.

01:10:12.507 --> 01:10:15.004
I have not betrayed you.

01:10:15.006 --> 01:10:17.104
My child!

01:10:17.106 --> 01:10:19.536
He was my child!

01:10:19.537 --> 01:10:21.102
My son!

01:10:21.104 --> 01:10:22.835
No, please.

01:10:22.836 --> 01:10:25.201
Please, get me help.

01:10:25.203 --> 01:10:26.235
Yes, yes.

01:10:29.032 --> 01:10:31.896
[sobbing] no.

01:10:31.898 --> 01:10:34.332
No, no.

01:10:38.162 --> 01:10:40.059
Help me, please.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:41.427
Get me help.

01:10:58.985 --> 01:11:02.715
Ankhesenamun.

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:05.051
Look at me.

01:11:08.114 --> 01:11:09.711
- I'm sorry.
- Don't.

01:11:09.713 --> 01:11:12.247
This is not your fault.

01:11:15.511 --> 01:11:19.346
Shh. Shh. Shh.

01:11:24.206 --> 01:11:27.574
You were right.

01:11:31.438 --> 01:11:34.734
I betrayed you.

01:11:34.736 --> 01:11:38.132
And now the gods
are going to punish me.

01:11:38.133 --> 01:11:40.834
[sobbing] they're punishing me.
They're punishing me.

01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:48.761
Shh.

01:12:02.155 --> 01:12:05.885
I've asked them
over and over why.

01:12:05.887 --> 01:12:09.649
Why these wounds
continue to hemorrhage.

01:12:09.652 --> 01:12:13.587
Their purpose is not for us
to question, my Lord.

01:12:18.048 --> 01:12:21.611
The dynasty of my ancestors,

01:12:21.613 --> 01:12:26.175
It will end with me.

01:12:26.177 --> 01:12:27.808
That will be my legacy.

01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:32.472
No, dear boy.

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:34.908
Your dynasty lives.

01:12:50.067 --> 01:12:53.769
You still have an heir,
my love.

01:12:59.762 --> 01:13:02.525
You've inspired me.

01:13:02.526 --> 01:13:06.555
Then I will stand by your side.

01:13:06.558 --> 01:13:10.454
I will never love another.

01:13:10.456 --> 01:13:13.553
And if the gods...
if they turn against me?

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:16.053
If I fall from the throne?

01:13:16.054 --> 01:13:18.717
If the pyramids crumble
under my watch?

01:13:18.719 --> 01:13:23.655
Then I will help you rebuild
them, stone by stone.

01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:57.499
He will make her his wife
and elevate her to queen.

01:13:57.501 --> 01:14:01.536
I advise prudence.

01:14:02.064 --> 01:14:04.595
I will not give in
so easily, ay.

01:14:04.598 --> 01:14:05.563
No, you won't.

01:14:05.564 --> 01:14:07.928
But as in all wars,

01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:12.559
It's best to know
your enemy's weakness.

01:14:12.561 --> 01:14:16.124
That is how you will best know
where to strike.

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:19.693
What exactly are you saying?

01:14:56.238 --> 01:14:57.570
You wanted to see me?

01:14:57.572 --> 01:14:59.036
The vizier has informed me

01:14:59.037 --> 01:15:01.468
That your parents
have come to Thebes.

01:15:01.471 --> 01:15:02.970
Why wasn't I told?

01:15:02.971 --> 01:15:05.866
Are they here in the palace?

01:15:05.867 --> 01:15:07.000
No.

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:09.898
As outsiders,
they were denied access.

01:15:09.899 --> 01:15:11.098
They're staying
at a nearby inn.

01:15:11.099 --> 01:15:14.095
With all the panic, guards are
pushing people out of the city,

01:15:14.097 --> 01:15:16.761
And I fear that your parents
may be amongst them.

01:15:16.763 --> 01:15:19.160
Then I must find them
before they're sent away.

01:15:19.161 --> 01:15:20.360
No, it's not safe for you.

01:15:20.362 --> 01:15:21.726
It's not safe for them either.

01:15:21.728 --> 01:15:24.692
All the more reason
it can't wait.

01:15:24.693 --> 01:15:27.523
They must be allowed
to come here.

01:15:27.525 --> 01:15:28.390
I will send Sete.

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:31.322
He is the trusted commander
of my royal guard.

01:15:31.324 --> 01:15:33.287
He won't know their faces.

01:15:33.288 --> 01:15:35.485
I know the city.

01:15:35.486 --> 01:15:36.152
Okay.

01:15:36.154 --> 01:15:39.488
Only if Sete is with you.

01:15:56.711 --> 01:15:57.876
They're inside.

01:15:57.877 --> 01:16:00.277
I'll wait here.

01:16:21.099 --> 01:16:23.199
Mother?
Father?

01:16:27.863 --> 01:16:30.193
Sete!
[banging on door]

01:16:30.195 --> 01:16:31.028
Sete!

01:16:45.088 --> 01:16:47.752
The soldiers told us
to wait here.

01:16:47.753 --> 01:16:50.083
They're bringing us medicine.

01:16:50.085 --> 01:16:52.319
Medicine?

01:17:00.814 --> 01:17:02.113
Come with us.

01:17:02.114 --> 01:17:03.944
All of you, now!

01:17:03.945 --> 01:17:06.842
(woman)
where are you taking us?

01:17:06.844 --> 01:17:08.575
No! Don't go!

01:17:08.576 --> 01:17:13.305
No! No! No! No!

01:17:13.307 --> 01:17:14.306
Move!

01:17:18.272 --> 01:17:20.802
No, I'm not sick.

01:17:20.804 --> 01:17:23.435
I'm not supposed to be here.
I'm from the palace.

01:17:23.436 --> 01:17:26.267
I'm with child.

01:17:26.269 --> 01:17:27.400
The Pharaoh's son.

01:17:27.401 --> 01:17:28.765
I'm to be made his wife.

01:17:28.766 --> 01:17:31.133
You have to take me
to the palace.

01:18:17.211 --> 01:18:20.579
Tell general Horemheb
this is the last of the sick.

01:19:21.946 --> 01:19:23.879
They're ready.

01:19:26.311 --> 01:19:28.678
You are certain?

01:19:55.764 --> 01:19:58.698
May the gods honor you.

01:21:56.773 --> 01:21:59.337
Future generations
will scarce remember

01:21:59.338 --> 01:22:01.102
Those who perish tonight,

01:22:01.104 --> 01:22:05.067
And history will acclaim
the greatness of Tutankhamun

01:22:05.069 --> 01:22:08.737
For saving the lives
of so many.

01:22:12.699 --> 01:22:16.501
See that Suhad is
in my chamber.
