01:37.431 --> 01:40.701
KRUSH GROOVE?

01:47.241 --> 01:49.343
* THEY TOLD US
IT WOULD GET NILLER *

01:49.410 --> 01:51.545
* THERE'S NO ONE CHILLER
IT'S NOT MICHAEL JACKSON *

01:51.612 --> 01:54.315
* AND THIS IS NOT THRILLER
IT'S ONE DEF RAPPER *

01:54.382 --> 01:56.217
* I KNOW I CAN HANG
I'M RUN FROM RUN-DMC *

01:56.284 --> 01:57.885

FROM KOOL & THE GANG *

01:57.951 --> 02:00.321
* ROLL TO THE ROCK,
ROCK TO THE ROLL *

02:00.388 --> 02:02.756
* D.M.C. STANDS
FOR "DEVASTATING MIKE CONTROL" *

02:02.823 --> 02:04.992
* YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME
WITH A TEN-FOOT POLE *

02:05.058 --> 02:07.795
* AND I EVEN MADE THE DEVIL
SELL ME HIS SOUL *

02:07.861 --> 02:10.964

AND KNOCK DOWN DOORS *

02:17.205 --> 02:20.007
* AND WHEN WE'RE ON THE TAPE,
WE'RE FRESH OUT THE BOX *

02:20.073 --> 02:22.476

02:30.418 --> 02:32.085
( music continuing )

02:32.152 --> 02:34.422
COME ON, HOMEY! MOVE IT.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.990
WE AIN'T GOT ALL DAY, MOVE IT!

02:37.057 --> 02:39.660
* NOW, WE'RE THE BADDEST OF
THE BAD, COOLEST OF THE COOL *

02:39.727 --> 02:42.129
* I'M D.M.C., I ROCK 'N' ROLL
I'M D.J. RUN, I ROCK 'N' RULE *

02:42.196 --> 02:44.665
* IT'S NOT A TRICK-OR-TREAT
AND IT'S NOT A APRIL FOOL *

02:44.732 --> 02:47.568
* IT'S ALL BRAND NEW,
NEVER EVER OLD SCHOOL... *

02:47.635 --> 02:48.836
( music continuing )

02:56.744 --> 02:59.079
* YOU GOT THE MUSIC IN YOUR BODY
AND YOU CAN'T COMPREHEND *

02:59.146 --> 03:02.350
* WHEN YOUR MIND WON'T WIGGLE
AND YOUR KNEES WON'T BEND *

03:02.416 --> 03:04.352
* Music ain't nothin'
but a people's jam *

03:04.418 --> 03:06.654
* It's D.J. Run-DMC,
rockin' without a band *

03:06.720 --> 03:09.790
( echoing ):
* Band, band, band,
band, band... *

03:12.260 --> 03:14.228
* I AM FROM AROUND THE WAY *

03:14.295 --> 03:16.797
* AND RUN GOES TO SCHOOL
EVERY DAY *

03:16.864 --> 03:18.866
* And Jay plays the records
he has to play *

03:18.932 --> 03:21.469
* And we get down
with no delay *

03:21.535 --> 03:24.071
* I RUN THE BOX
WITH THE WORDS I SPEAK *

03:24.137 --> 03:26.106
* AND RUN SINGS THE RHYMES
THAT ARE UNIQUE *

03:26.173 --> 03:28.976
* AND JAY CUTS THE RECORDS
EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK *

03:29.042 --> 03:31.645
* AND WE ARE THE CREW
THAT CAN NEVER BE BEAT *

03:31.712 --> 03:33.981
* So don't try to dis me,
try to be my friend *
( syncopated grunting )

03:34.047 --> 03:36.517
* 'Cause if you do,
you'll get yours in the end *

03:36.584 --> 03:39.019
* The rap we say
will set a trend *
YEAH...

03:39.086 --> 03:41.722
* 'Cause a devastating rap
is what we say *
THAT'S IT.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.325
( echoing ):
* Say, say, say, say...*

03:49.062 --> 03:51.064
STAY OFF THAT CAR!

03:51.131 --> 03:53.401
* EVERY JAM WE PLAY,
WE BREAK TWO NEEDLES *

03:53.467 --> 03:55.703
YOU'RE FIRED!
I'M FIRED?

03:55.769 --> 03:58.238
All:
FIRED?
WE QUIT!

03:58.306 --> 04:03.811
WAIT! I'LL TAKE BACK THE MUSIC.
WHO'S GOING TO CLEAN THE CARS?!

04:03.877 --> 04:06.380
* "D's" FOR NEVER DIRTY
"M.C." FOR MOSTLY CLEAN *

04:06.447 --> 04:09.350
( echoing ):
* Clean, clean,
clean, clean... *

04:15.823 --> 04:18.190
* Like we said before
We rock hard-core *

04:18.257 --> 04:20.827
* I'm D.J. Run, I can scratch
I'm D.M.C., I can draw *

04:20.894 --> 04:23.464
* And now we got the knack
to attract *

04:23.531 --> 04:25.766
* Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac *

04:25.833 --> 04:28.268
* We'll reign on your brain
and rock your knot *

04:28.336 --> 04:30.771
* When it comes to a rhyme,
give it all we got *

04:30.838 --> 04:33.206
* To be M.C.s,
we got what it takes *

04:33.273 --> 04:35.343
* Let the poppers pop *
and the breakers break *
( laughing )

04:35.409 --> 04:36.810
* We're cool, cool cats *

04:36.877 --> 04:38.612
* It's like that *
OH, BOY!

04:38.679 --> 04:40.748
* That's the way it is,
so stay the hell back *

04:40.814 --> 04:42.883
* WE'RE CAUSING HARD TIMES
FOR SUCKER M.C.s *

04:42.950 --> 04:46.119
* 'CAUSE THEY DON'T MAKE
NO SONGS LIKE THESE *

04:46.186 --> 04:47.621
* PERIOD. *

04:50.924 --> 04:52.660
* DON'T STOP *

04:52.726 --> 04:54.728
( echoing ):
* DON'T STOP... *

05:01.034 --> 05:03.070
* WE'RE CAUSING HARD TIMES
FOR SUCKER M.C.s *

WHOO! OH, YOU SAID IT, BOY.

05:09.276 --> 05:12.513
THOSE BOYS ARE DEF!
THEY ARE DEF

05:12.580 --> 05:14.247
* SUCKER M.C.s
SHOULD CALL ME SIRE *

05:14.314 --> 05:17.385
* TO BURN MY KINGDOM,

05:17.451 --> 05:20.053
WE'LL BE BIG ONCE
WE PLAY THE FEVER.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.055
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING--

05:22.122 --> 05:24.458
THAT'S HOW HOMEBOYS

05:24.525 --> 05:26.594
KURTIS BLOW, DR. JECKYL,

05:26.660 --> 05:28.829
ONCE YOU GET

05:28.896 --> 05:30.831
I'M TELLING YOU, BOY,
IT'S LIKE MAGIC.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.701
THE FEVER--
THAT'S ALL YOU TALK ABOUT
IS THE FEVER, MAN!

05:33.767 --> 05:37.004
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
JUST DON'T WANT TO DO.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.408
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS STUFFING
YOUR FAT FACE, RIGHT?

05:40.474 --> 05:42.209
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE A STAR?

05:42.275 --> 05:44.645
Woman:
KRUSH GROOVE.
YEAH, HOLD ON A SECOND.

05:44.712 --> 05:49.817
YEAH? OKAY, HOW MANY?
OKAY, YOU GOT IT.

05:49.883 --> 05:55.188
YOU'LL GET THEM
AS SOON AS I GET THEM, OKAY?

05:55.255 --> 05:57.558
KRUSH GROOVE

05:57.625 --> 05:59.860
( laughing ):
WHAT'S UP, RICK?

05:59.927 --> 06:01.795
KRUSH GROOVE HERE.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.065
I KNOW YOU WANTED LAST WEEK.
I WILL GET THEM TO YOU SOON.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.669
I'M SORRY. HOPEFULLY,
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

06:08.736 --> 06:12.239
YO, I TOOK 100 ORDERS TODAY
THEY ALL WANT IT YESTERDAY!

06:12.305 --> 06:14.041
I HAVE 60 MORE

06:14.107 --> 06:16.276
IT'S HAPPENING
JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

06:16.343 --> 06:18.078
JUST LIKE
YOU TOLD ME?
RIGHT.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.213
WE'RE SELLING RECORDS
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.283
A HIT RECORD IS THE WORST THING
THAT COULD'VE HAPPENED TO US.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.953
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.
THAT'S MINOR.

06:26.019 --> 06:29.823
WE HAVE NO MONEY.
WE CAN'T PRESS UP
ANY MORE RECORDS!

06:29.890 --> 06:33.661
I WILL GET THE MONEY.
JUST CHILL. TRUST ME.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.897
THIS IS RICK. YOU'LL GET
YOUR RECORD TOMORROW.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.967
IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED, TELL
YOUR OLD MAN TO GET UP HERE.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.202
IF NOT, I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT,
ALL RIGHT?

06:42.269 --> 06:45.906
YO, MAN, I'M TIRED OF
HEARING YOUR NONSENSE.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.876
YO, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST-JUST GET OUT?!

06:48.942 --> 06:50.878
ALL RIGHT, HEY,
MAN, LOOK, RELAX.

( students laughing )

06:55.115 --> 06:59.487
Woman:
THAT'S ENOUGH! EVERYONE JUST
CALM DOWN AND PAY ATTENTION.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.656
DISSECTING THE FETAL PIG
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.993
IT COUNTS FOR 75%
OF YOUR LAB GRADE.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.361
SO, IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE GROANING NOW

07:08.428 --> 07:10.163
JUST KEEP CLOWNING AROUND

07:10.230 --> 07:13.734
AND YOU'LL REALLY HAVE SOMETHING
TO GROAN ABOUT.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.775
Woman:
ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR SPECIMEN OPEN

07:21.842 --> 07:25.979
I WANT YOU TO IDENTIFY

07:45.365 --> 07:48.068
SPEAK UP.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.438

08:02.349 --> 08:05.352
Teacher:
IT'S YOU, THE FAT ONE!
STAND UP!

08:05.418 --> 08:09.456
I SAID, "STAND UP!"

08:09.523 --> 08:11.859
OH...
WISE GUYS.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.061
REPORT TO
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.395
FOR WHAT?

08:15.462 --> 08:17.998
OUT OF MY CLASS...
NOW.

08:18.065 --> 08:21.602
OH, SHE WANT...
YOU WANT TO PLAY LIKE THAT.

08:21.669 --> 08:25.806
AND YOU ALL GET "F"
FOR FETAL PIG.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.808
YO, FORGET THAT
TEACHER, MAN.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.711
COME ON. I GOT AN IDEA.
WE AIN'T GOT ALL DAY.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.846
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

08:32.913 --> 08:35.248
COME ON, MAN!
( snickering )

08:39.486 --> 08:41.121
HURRY UP, MAN.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.123
WHAT'S THE

08:43.190 --> 08:44.925
( talking indistinctly )

08:44.992 --> 08:47.060
DISCO THREE!

08:47.127 --> 08:49.262
IT'S ALMOST TIME, MAN,
IT'S ALMOST TIME.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.363
( bell ringing )

08:50.430 --> 08:52.866
( rap music playing )

08:59.973 --> 09:02.009
* NOW, BABY,
LISTEN TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY *

09:02.075 --> 09:04.812
* AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO,
I'LL SAY IT ANYWAY *

09:04.878 --> 09:07.014
* NOW, I ONCE HAD A LADY,
SHE WAS SO FLY *

09:07.080 --> 09:09.349
* SHE WAS MY GIRL,
AND I WAS HER GUY *

09:09.416 --> 09:11.819
* HOW I LOVED THAT GIRL
WITH ALL MY HEART *

09:11.885 --> 09:13.987
* BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE,
SHE WOULD TEAR IT APART *

09:14.054 --> 09:16.423
* I'M TALKING TEN DOLLARS HERE,
A HUNDRED THERE *

09:16.489 --> 09:18.592
* SHE WASN'T ASHAMED,
SHE'D ASK ME ANYWHERE *

09:18.659 --> 09:20.828
* SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE GIRLS
WHO DIDN'T GIVE A HOOT *

09:20.894 --> 09:23.597
* AND TORE MY HEART
FROM THE VINE, STEM AND ROOT *

09:23.664 --> 09:25.766
* THEN, I MET YOU
AND YOU MET ME *

09:25.833 --> 09:28.201
* AND YOU'RE THE BRAND NEW
MS. MARKIE D *

09:28.268 --> 09:30.403
* AND ALL I ASK
IS THAT YOU TREAT ME RIGHT *

09:30.470 --> 09:32.572
* THROUGH EVERY
LASTING DAY AND NIGHT *

09:32.640 --> 09:35.208
* AND I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU
WANT AND IN THE RIGHT WAY *

09:35.275 --> 09:38.011
* AND THERE'S ONE MORE THING
I HAVE TO SAY *

09:38.078 --> 09:40.480
* DON'T YOU DOG ME *

09:40.547 --> 09:42.750

A LEMON TO A LIME *

10:03.937 --> 10:06.139
* I'M THE M.C.
WITH THE FRESH RHYME *

10:06.206 --> 10:08.175
* AND WHEN I WANNA SEE
YOU LADIES SCREAM FOR ME *

10:08.241 --> 10:11.044

KNOWN AS KOOL ROCK SKI *

10:11.111 --> 10:13.213

* HEY, GIRL,
DON'T YOU LOVE ME, GIRL? *

10:34.668 --> 10:36.670
* DON'T YOU DOG ME *

10:36.737 --> 10:39.406
* YOU LOOK SO SWEETY *

10:39.472 --> 10:41.074

10:41.141 --> 10:44.044
* HEY, GIRL, I LOVE YOU-YOU *

10:44.111 --> 10:46.680

10:46.747 --> 10:48.816
( human beat box
rhythmic panting )

10:48.882 --> 10:50.684
* DON'T YOU DOG ME *

10:50.751 --> 10:52.385
( barking )

10:52.452 --> 10:53.586

Man:
* I AM TIRED *

11:00.794 --> 11:03.731
* I AM WEAK *

11:03.797 --> 11:07.000
* I AM ONE *

11:07.067 --> 11:09.737
* THROUGH THE STORM *

11:09.803 --> 11:14.107
( rap music playing )
* THROUGH THE NIGHT... *

11:14.174 --> 11:17.244
JOEY, FOR GOD'S SAKE
TURN THE BOX OFF.

11:20.013 --> 11:23.516
AT LEAST HAVE SOME RESPECT
FOR THE CHURCH OF THE LORD.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.353
THIS IS MY NEW RECORD.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT?

11:26.419 --> 11:29.289
IT'S A LOT OF SCREAMING
AND NOISE. IT'S NOT MUSIC.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.524
RUSSELL SAYS IT'S
THE HOTTEST RECORD.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.393
RUSSELL? THAT BIG DUMMY?

11:33.460 --> 11:35.829
HE DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE
IN HIS SENIOR YEAR

11:35.896 --> 11:37.865
AND YOU'RE RELYING
ON HIS JUDGMENT?

11:37.931 --> 11:40.167
FURTHERMORE TAKE YOUR
HATS OFF IN HERE.

11:40.233 --> 11:43.036
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT
YOU QUITTING YOUR CAR WASH JOBS?

11:43.103 --> 11:47.040
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
ME AND D ARE STARS NOW.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.176
WE CAN'T BE WORKING
AT NO CAR WASH.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.780
YOU WOULDN'T SEE LIONEL RICHIE
WORKING AT NO CAR WASH.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.948
NOW YOU ARE
LIONEL RICHIE...

11:55.015 --> 11:56.483
AND YOU'RE PRINCE...

11:56.549 --> 11:58.285
AND HERE COMES
BERRY GORDY.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.520
RUSSELL, WILL YOU TELL HIM
THAT WE ARE STARS?

12:00.587 --> 12:03.556
OH, YEAH, DAD-- MY HOME
BOYS ARE SUPERSTARS NOW.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.793
THEY'VE GOT THE HOTTEST
RECORD ON THE STREETS.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.662
SOLD OUT IN THREE HOURS.
MY BOYS.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.265
SO HOW ARE YOU
DOING, POP?
LOOKING GOOD.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.700
I'M FINE.
GOOD.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.269
BUT WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:16.336 --> 12:19.339
WHY DO THINK I WANT SOMETHING?
I JUST CAME TO SEE YOU.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.109
RUSSELL, YOU NEVER
PUT YOUR FOOT IN THIS CHURCH

12:22.175 --> 12:25.545
UNLESS YOU WANT SOMETHING.
NOW, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:25.612 --> 12:26.914
I NEED MONEY.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.349
THAT'S MORE LIKE YOU.
HOW MUCH?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.683
NOT MUCH.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.686
NOT MUCH?
HOW MUCH IS NOT MUCH?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.722
$5,000. I KNOW
THAT'S A WHOLE LOT...

12:35.789 --> 12:39.559
$5,000?!
IT WAS NICE SEEING YOU.

12:39.626 --> 12:43.163
WAIT A MINUTE, DAD,
HEAR ME OUT BEFORE
YOU SAY NO.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.299
NOTHING IN THE WORLD
WILL MAKE ME GIVE YOU $5,000.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.301
JUST LISTEN TO
ME, WILL YOU?

12:48.368 --> 12:51.638
EVERY TIME I'VE SOMETHING
TO SAY YOU NEVER LISTEN.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.407
I NEED MONEY FAST.
REAL FAST.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.510
I GOT AN ORDER
FOR 10,000 RECORDS...

12:57.577 --> 13:00.480
IF I DON'T DELIVER THEM,
EVERYTHING WE SAVED FOR...

13:00.547 --> 13:04.584
EVERYTHING WE'VE WORKED FOR
IS GOING TO BE FLUSHED.

13:04.651 --> 13:07.420
BELIEVE ME, I WOULDN'T ASK
IF I DIDN'T REALLY NEED IT.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.790
YOU KNOW HOW I SEE THIS,
RUSSELL?

13:10.858 --> 13:13.393
I THINK GOD IS TESTING YOU.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.296
I THINK IF YOU DO
THIS ONE THING ON YOUR OWN

13:16.363 --> 13:19.833
IT WILL FINALLY PROVE
THAT YOU'RE GROWING UP.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.836
I BELIEVE THIS TO BE GOD'S WILL

13:22.903 --> 13:25.138
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO INTERFERE WITH IT.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.341
( disco music playing )

13:38.986 --> 13:39.920

14:25.132 --> 14:27.100

15:09.276 --> 15:11.744
I LIKE THAT. IT'S SWEET.

YOU CAN DO

19:42.181 --> 19:44.351

NO ONE'S GONNA
SEE ME HERE.
I SAW YOU.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.955

24:05.411 --> 24:07.747
YOUR REQUEST FOR A LOAN
IS DENIED.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.782
MAYBE WHEN YOU GET

27:41.527 --> 27:44.897

29:17.723 --> 29:20.126
* JUST HERE TO TELL THE WORLD
HOW THE STORY WENT *

29:20.192 --> 29:22.594
* YOU SEE, FIRST IT WAS A DREAM,
I WAS LIVING IN ROME *

29:22.661 --> 29:25.097
* THEN I MOVED TO LONDON
AND BOUGHT A BRAND-NEW HOME *

29:25.164 --> 29:27.533
* AND EVERYWHERE I WENT
I DREW LOTS OF ATTENTION *

29:27.599 --> 29:30.469
* LIKE A STRETCH LIMOUSINE
WHEN IT LEAVES THE CONVENTION *

29:30.536 --> 29:32.504
* IT TOOK A FEW YEARS
BEFORE THE DAY HAD COME *

29:32.571 --> 29:35.207
* BUT I WAS RULER OF THE WORLD,
RANKED NUMBER ONE *

29:35.274 --> 29:37.576
* SO I HEADED FOR THE POLITICS
AND CLAIMED THE CROWN *

29:37.643 --> 29:40.379
* AND LET THE WHOLE WORLD KNOW
THAT THE KING WAS IN TOWN *

29:40.446 --> 29:42.448
* GOOD-BYE, GOOD-BYE,
THE CROWD STARTED TO CHEER *

29:42.514 --> 29:45.184
* THEN SOMEONE YELLED OUT,
"THE KING IS HERE!" *

29:45.251 --> 29:47.319
* SO I HEADED FOR THE STAGE
TO MAKE A SPEECH *

29:47.386 --> 29:50.589
* ABOUT THE NEW STYLE OF LIVING
I WAS GONNA TEACH *

29:50.656 --> 29:54.994
* IF I RULED THE WORLD *

29:55.061 --> 29:57.629
* I WOULD LOVE ALL THE GIRLS *

43:50.061 --> 43:52.430
YOU THINK I'LL STAND
AND LISTEN TO THIS SHIT.

43:52.497 --> 43:53.965
WAIT, RUN.

44:14.853 --> 44:17.488
LOOK, SHEILA
I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS.

44:17.555 --> 44:20.558
IT'S JUST RIGHT NOW,
RUN'S GOT ME A LITTLE NERVOUS.

44:20.625 --> 44:23.628
I JUST HOPE I DIDN'T CAUSE
ANY PROBLEMS BETWEEN YOU TWO.

44:23.695 --> 44:27.098
LOOK, RUN AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS
AND THERE'S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE

44:27.165 --> 44:29.968
AND WHATEVER IS BETWEEN YOU TWO
IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

44:30.035 --> 44:33.271
I THOUGHT YOU TWO...
YOU THOUGHT
WRONG, RUSSELL.

44:49.721 --> 44:52.290
WELL, I'VE HAD
ENOUGH FUN TONIGHT.

44:52.357 --> 44:56.061
LOOK, LET ME SEE YOU HOME.
IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO.

44:56.127 --> 44:57.128
WHATEVER.

45:00.732 --> 45:04.669
Terri:
WISH YOU'D COME OVER TO GALAXY.
I'LL REALLY GET YOU OUT THERE.

45:04.736 --> 45:05.837
YEAH?

45:05.904 --> 45:07.839
HELL, YEAH.
YOU LIKE THIS?

45:07.906 --> 45:10.408
LIMOUSINE, CHAMPAGNE,

45:10.475 --> 45:12.811
I GET YOU ON MTV, NATIONAL TOUR

45:12.878 --> 45:14.813
SPONSORSHIP, YOU NAME IT.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.248
YOU COULD DO THAT?
HELL, YEAH.

45:17.315 --> 45:19.417
STRAIGHT.
BUT IT'S YOUR BROTHER.

45:19.484 --> 45:21.452
TONIGHT, I OFFERED HIM
SERIOUS MONEY TO BRING

45:21.519 --> 45:23.955
YOU, DR. JECKYL
AND MR. HYDE AND KURTIS BLOW

45:24.022 --> 45:26.191
OVER TO GALAXY RECORDS;
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID?

45:26.257 --> 45:29.160
WHAT?
TURNED ME DOWN COLD.

45:29.227 --> 45:30.395
HE'S REAL ILL.

45:30.461 --> 45:33.098
I'M NOT TRYING TO GO
BEHIND YOUR BROTHER'S BACK

45:33.164 --> 45:36.902
BUT A MAJOR RECORD COMPANY DEAL
DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY DAY

45:36.968 --> 45:38.703
AND IT'S YOUR CAREER
HE'S PLAYING WITH.

45:38.770 --> 45:42.340
IF I WERE YOU I'D JUST BE
A LITTLE BIT
CONCERNED ABOUT IT

45:42.407 --> 45:45.410
BECAUSE I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO MAKE THAT SAME OFFER
TOMORROW.

45:45.476 --> 45:47.545
THINK ABOUT IT.
CHEERS, RUN.
ALL RIGHT.

45:47.612 --> 45:49.848
LOVE TO HAVE YOU, MAN.

46:10.335 --> 46:13.939

46:44.802 --> 46:48.874

46:55.313 --> 46:58.516
Both:

STEREO EQUIPMENT.

46:58.583 --> 47:02.320
PSST MAN. I'D SURE LIKE
TO WIN THAT STEREO EQUIPMENT.

47:02.387 --> 47:06.191
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN TRYING
TO DO FOR THE LONGEST, HUH?

47:06.257 --> 47:08.426
GET IN THE FEVER, RIGHT?
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT...

47:08.493 --> 47:12.663

47:12.730 --> 47:14.332
RIGHT?

47:14.399 --> 47:18.904
WRONG. I AIN'T DOING NOTHING.
JACK BONE, DOING NOTHING.

47:18.970 --> 47:21.239

48:16.727 --> 48:18.596
BOX!

48:18.663 --> 48:20.031
( rap beat playing )

48:20.098 --> 48:21.967
WE'RE THROUGH.

48:22.033 --> 48:25.070
WHO ARE YOU, MAN?

48:25.136 --> 48:28.506
Dr. Jeckyl:
WHAT'S UP WITH THIS?

48:28.573 --> 48:31.142
* MY RADIO, BELIEVE ME,

48:34.279 --> 48:36.581
* WALKIN' DOWN THE STREET

48:36.647 --> 48:38.950
* WHILE MY J.V.C. VIBRATES

48:39.017 --> 48:41.486
* I'M SORRY
IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND *

48:41.552 --> 48:44.489
* BUT I NEED A RADIO
INSIDE MY HAND *

48:44.555 --> 48:47.258
* DON'T MEAN TO OFFEND
OTHER CITIZENS *

48:47.325 --> 48:49.827
* BUT I KICK MY VOLUME
WAY PAST TEN *

48:49.894 --> 48:50.928
* MY STORY IS ROUGH *

48:50.996 --> 48:52.563
* MY NEIGHBORHOOD IS TOUGH *

48:52.630 --> 48:54.799

49:22.627 --> 49:25.030
HE'S OVER AT THE
FEVER JUDGING THAT
CONTEST, YOU KNOW.

49:25.096 --> 49:28.366
DID YOU KNOW HE TURNED DOWN
A BIG CONTRACT
FROM GALAXY RECORDS?

49:28.433 --> 49:30.901
WHAT?
GALAXY RECORDS?
WHAT?

49:30.968 --> 49:34.372
I WAS WITH BEIKER LAST NIGHT,
HE TOLD ME THAT HE OFFERED HIM

49:34.439 --> 49:37.242
LOT OF MONEY FOR OUR GROUPS
AND HE TURNED IT DOWN

49:37.308 --> 49:40.545
WITHOUT ASKING
ANY OF US.
GET OUT OF HERE.

49:40.611 --> 49:42.580
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, THAT'S
BULLSHIT.

49:42.647 --> 49:45.750
ME, D AND J, WE GOT
TO THINK FOR OURSELF.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.985
AND IF SOMEBODY GONNA OFFER ME
SOMETHING LIKE THIS

49:48.053 --> 49:52.390

50:26.157 --> 50:28.359

RUN... I THOUGHT

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:10.339
NAH, THIS AIN'T RUSSELL.

LOOK, RUSSELL'S OLD ENOUGH
TO TAKE CARE OF HISSELF.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

ALL YOU DO IS THINK

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:40.236
EVERYTHING IS RUN.

RUSSELL DID FOR YOU.

THEY WERE STARTING
