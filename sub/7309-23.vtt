WEBVTT

00:05.461 --> 00:08.621
These Marines sure take
this stuff seriously.

00:09.778 --> 00:13.125
Might as well get comfortable;
This could take some time.

00:13.149 --> 00:16.254
Check the ID, check the trunk.

00:16.277 --> 00:20.759
No dogs. Hate dogs. Dogs
are a pain in the ass.

00:20.783 --> 00:23.393
Never met a dog that didn't
want to try to bite me.

00:23.417 --> 00:26.234
Looking for bombs or bin Laden, I guess.

00:26.258 --> 00:27.315
Clear.

00:27.339 --> 00:28.759
Finally.

00:28.783 --> 00:30.276
Proceed.

00:31.470 --> 00:32.731
Good morning, sir.

00:32.755 --> 00:35.229
- Photo ID and pop the trunk, please.
- Sure thing.

00:38.695 --> 00:39.672
Drop off?

00:39.696 --> 00:42.690
Guy says he wants to
see someone at NCIS.

00:43.366 --> 00:44.416
Clear.

00:47.322 --> 00:49.227
Lower the window, please, sir.

00:50.942 --> 00:53.512
Hey, buddy, lady needs to see some ID.

00:56.722 --> 00:58.677
Photo ID, please, sir.

01:00.342 --> 01:01.355
Sir?

01:01.609 --> 01:03.535
Step out of the vehicle, please.

01:59.576 --> 02:02.038
These files have to
be reviewed by Friday.

02:02.545 --> 02:03.698
I'll get to them.

02:03.722 --> 02:05.792
Tomorrow's Friday.

02:08.204 --> 02:10.842
Had a wife like you once, Cynthia.

02:11.149 --> 02:13.676
- I divorced her.
- Beat her to it, did you?

02:26.686 --> 02:27.676
You didn't read it.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.963
Scoletti case. I know the case agent.

02:29.987 --> 02:32.246
Jeff Gillman. He's a good man.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.454
Director doesn't want
Justice not going to trial

02:35.478 --> 02:36.904
because of a procedural error.

02:36.928 --> 02:40.325
Well, then the Director should be here
instead of shopping in Paris all week.

02:40.349 --> 02:43.506
An Interpol antiterrorist
conference isn't shopping.

02:43.530 --> 02:44.543
Yeah.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.985
You know him, too?

02:46.009 --> 02:48.342
Yep. Don't worry.

02:48.366 --> 02:51.162
Justice has its own procedural problems.

02:53.430 --> 02:55.363
Who's Special Agent Grisham?

02:55.635 --> 02:57.529
Transferred in from San Diego.

02:57.553 --> 02:59.529
Hollywood Special Agent.

02:59.553 --> 03:02.579
- Rejected.
- You have to give a reason.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.263
It's her private line.

03:14.306 --> 03:15.953
Hello, Cynthia.

03:20.612 --> 03:21.784
Cynthia?

03:21.808 --> 03:23.602
No...

03:24.037 --> 03:25.629
Jethro.

03:25.994 --> 03:28.641
I should have recognized
the heavy breathing.

03:29.263 --> 03:30.719
Is the Agency intact?

03:30.743 --> 03:34.683
I cut it up into small bitsy pieces
and sold it to the three-letter boys.

03:34.707 --> 03:37.826
I take it walking my heels
has presented a challenge.

03:37.850 --> 03:41.452
Well, I accepted some
speaking requests for you.

03:41.476 --> 03:43.171
Which speaking requests?

03:43.195 --> 03:45.722
Women for Women, St.
Paul, Minnesota chapter.

03:45.746 --> 03:48.533
The eighth grade class of Hondo
Middle School in Hondo, Texas.

03:48.557 --> 03:51.116
The teacher, she's an admirer.

03:51.140 --> 03:54.392
Society of Preservation
for Barbershop Quartets.

03:54.416 --> 03:56.123
You're not serious, Jethro.

03:56.147 --> 03:58.786
Well, about the barbershop
quartets, no, no, I'm not.

03:58.810 --> 04:02.346
But I did accept six, seven... eight,

04:02.370 --> 04:03.785
nine others for you.

04:03.809 --> 04:06.399
- Put Cynthia on.
- Hey, how's the frog...

04:07.847 --> 04:08.951
legs?

04:08.995 --> 04:11.098
You always enjoyed
them sauted in butter.

04:11.122 --> 04:13.296
Cynthia. Now!

04:15.504 --> 04:16.771
Yes, Director.

04:17.043 --> 04:20.411
Tell me you didn't send out
acceptances for speaking engagements.

04:20.435 --> 04:22.223
Of course not, Director.

04:22.247 --> 04:23.659
Thank you, Cynthia.

04:23.683 --> 04:26.069
You have just earned
yourself a Hermes scarf.

04:26.093 --> 04:27.594
Thank you, Director.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.988
C'Ã©tait un grand plaisir, madame.

04:31.821 --> 04:32.997
Au revoir.

04:34.981 --> 04:36.592
Put him back on.

04:39.437 --> 04:40.610
Yes...?

04:40.900 --> 04:43.415
Is there any serious
business I should know about?

04:43.439 --> 04:44.611
Well, the...

04:44.635 --> 04:48.297
Buy America toilet paper doesn't fit the
metric fixtures, and we got a truck...

04:51.061 --> 04:52.553
She hang up on me.

04:52.577 --> 04:53.843
Shocking.

04:56.359 --> 04:57.836
You call back to apologize?

05:00.129 --> 05:02.171
I don't know what you heard, boss,

05:02.195 --> 05:04.885
but I was not the one
who started that pool.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.662
What pool is that, DiNozzo?

05:10.686 --> 05:12.914
- On the case.
- What case?

05:12.938 --> 05:16.226
"There's a dead body in the
taxi at the main gate" case.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.855
I'll be right there.

05:17.879 --> 05:19.417
The case files?

05:19.707 --> 05:21.022
Leave them on my desk.

05:21.046 --> 05:22.521
They are on your desk.

05:24.939 --> 05:29.654
It's not often we get to walk to a
crime scene, if this is a crime scene.

05:30.251 --> 05:34.661
There's no blood, no bullet
holes, no knife punctures,

05:34.685 --> 05:38.728
no obvious signs of
bruising, no ligiture marks,

05:38.752 --> 05:42.664
no petechial hemorrhaging
on the eye or eyelid.

05:42.688 --> 05:43.977
Natural causes?

05:44.001 --> 05:48.022
There's nothing natural about a man
of his age keeling over in a taxicab.

05:48.294 --> 05:51.564
Maybe he died of embarrassment
when he couldn't pay the cab fare.

05:51.980 --> 05:54.172
Alas, death by embarrassment

05:54.196 --> 05:58.592
is not a certifiable cause,
however intriguing the notion.

05:59.551 --> 06:01.235
Excuse me, Ducky.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.944
It's about time that boy fell in love.

06:05.758 --> 06:07.292
I found a house.

06:07.316 --> 06:09.605
House? Thought we were
renting an apartment.

06:09.629 --> 06:11.606
No, we're buying a house.

06:11.630 --> 06:13.056
Buying?

06:13.080 --> 06:15.720
It's the most adorable
little bungalow, Tony.

06:15.744 --> 06:18.833
Only Hollywood has bungalows, Jeanne.

06:19.612 --> 06:21.471
You don't want to buy a house with me?

06:21.495 --> 06:23.277
I love playing House with you.

06:23.301 --> 06:24.856
Not the same thing.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.806
Can I call you back tonight?

06:26.830 --> 06:29.667
My boss is on his way over
and he doesn't look very happy.

06:29.691 --> 06:31.582
I thought you ran things over there.

06:31.606 --> 06:33.489
I do. Just not all the time.

06:33.923 --> 06:36.050
We'll play house tonight.

06:36.511 --> 06:38.764
Hey, I win the pool!

06:38.788 --> 06:40.231
Wait a minute. How do you figure that?

06:40.255 --> 06:43.965
I predicted that Gibbs would
last four days as Director

06:43.989 --> 06:46.045
before reverting to working a case.

06:46.069 --> 06:48.931
This is Thursday. Four days!

06:49.148 --> 06:51.574
He's not working on case. He's just...

06:51.954 --> 06:53.048
curious.

06:54.242 --> 06:57.232
Every time he's been at the crime
scene, he's been there to investigate.

06:57.256 --> 06:59.796
- How is today different?
- He is in the Navy Yard

06:59.820 --> 07:02.297
because that's where the
Director's office is located.

07:02.321 --> 07:03.494
Let's ask him.

07:03.518 --> 07:06.273
So you would have Gibbs give
up his post as Acting Director

07:06.297 --> 07:08.197
just to win a $50 pool?

07:08.505 --> 07:09.753
Yes.

07:10.570 --> 07:13.452
Guess it's true what they
say about the Scotsmen.

07:17.694 --> 07:22.359
I trust that if Gibbs is more than
just curious, you will inform me?

07:23.336 --> 07:24.895
Scout's honor.

07:27.773 --> 07:29.812
You said you were
never in the Boy Scouts.

07:29.836 --> 07:33.599
I was an Alpha Chi Delta wet
T-shirt spring-break talent scout.

07:33.852 --> 07:35.155
Does that count?

07:36.296 --> 07:37.568
Give me some love.

07:38.508 --> 07:41.846
You gave that man too much to
swallow in one bite, Dr. Benoit.

07:41.870 --> 07:44.108
It's a house, Carly, not a steak.

07:44.132 --> 07:48.672
From rental apartment to buying a
house in one phone call, are you crazy?

07:48.696 --> 07:51.485
You got to take these things slow.

07:51.509 --> 07:53.735
Toss a few home magazines around.

07:53.759 --> 07:57.174
Leave the real estate section of
the Sunday paper next to the toilet.

07:57.198 --> 07:59.508
Well, he does crossword
puzzles in there.

07:59.683 --> 08:02.163
Okay, talk to him about
it when he's vulnerable.

08:02.959 --> 08:04.549
Tony's never vulnerable.

08:04.573 --> 08:07.844
Not even when you put on
your best bedside manner?

08:09.386 --> 08:11.147
Driver's name is Joe Kelly.

08:11.171 --> 08:14.362
He says the victim hailed him on 25th
Street and told him to bring him here.

08:14.386 --> 08:15.981
- To see?
- Us.

08:16.216 --> 08:18.309
He did not specify a particular agent.

08:19.949 --> 08:21.976
Mr. Kelly, did you ever
see your fare before?

08:22.000 --> 08:22.990
Never.

08:23.014 --> 08:26.454
He seem injured or ill
when you picked him up?

08:26.478 --> 08:27.675
Not really.

08:27.699 --> 08:29.550
He was kind of out of breath.

08:29.574 --> 08:30.631
Like he was running?

08:30.655 --> 08:33.280
Yeah, and he kept looking
back over his shoulder

08:33.304 --> 08:34.727
like he thought someone
might be following us.

08:34.751 --> 08:35.727
Were they?

08:35.751 --> 08:37.760
Good luck tailing
anyone in D.C. traffic.

08:37.961 --> 08:39.136
Did he speak to you?

08:39.373 --> 08:40.385
Not a word.

08:40.630 --> 08:42.428
As usual, I did all the talking.

08:42.452 --> 08:43.863
Passes the time, you know?

08:43.886 --> 08:47.253
I passed the time, he
passed away, poor guy.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.818
- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Secnav is holding, sir.

08:49.842 --> 08:51.077
Secnav? Tell him I'm...

08:51.101 --> 08:53.989
I already told him you on the
Navy Yard and available, sir.

08:54.013 --> 08:56.780
Cynthia, don't ever tell
anybody I'm available

08:56.804 --> 08:58.867
until I tell you I'm available, okay?

08:58.891 --> 09:00.248
- Yes, sir.
- Put him through.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.491
- That the Director on the phone?
- Secnav.

09:02.515 --> 09:05.652
- Wonder what Gibbs did wrong.
- Slipped into Jenny's heels.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.430
Ziva, take the driver's statement.

09:08.454 --> 09:09.930
I already did.

09:09.954 --> 09:12.681
McGee crime scene photos, finish 'em.

09:12.705 --> 09:14.582
- Yeah, I finished them.
- You get an I.D.?

09:14.606 --> 09:18.990
Yeah, the photo on the Yemeni's
driver's license matches the victim's.

09:19.014 --> 09:21.650
"Hamal Farhan". No buzzers.

09:21.674 --> 09:23.412
- Bells.
- What else?

09:23.436 --> 09:26.741
List, seven names on it,
Farhan is number five.

09:26.765 --> 09:29.768
Obviously, whatever he wanted to tell
us had something to do with this list.

09:29.792 --> 09:30.998
Find everyone on it.

09:31.022 --> 09:32.919
So, Director, does that mean you're...?

09:32.943 --> 09:35.431
I'm heading the investigation.

09:35.455 --> 09:38.418
Hey, Duck, you win the pool.

09:38.442 --> 09:39.599
Yes!

09:39.798 --> 09:41.112
Thank you, Jethro.

09:41.136 --> 09:43.542
And I didn't do anything wrong, McGee.

09:50.644 --> 09:54.189
Black Rose has countered
our ejection-seat bid.

09:57.016 --> 10:00.986
How does the POB hope to maintain
a classical ballet company

10:01.010 --> 10:03.331
if there are no
classical works scheduled?

10:03.566 --> 10:05.539
I have no idea.

10:06.082 --> 10:07.681
Black Rose, Rene?

10:07.705 --> 10:09.375
What is La Dame's bid?

10:10.957 --> 10:13.501
20,000 Euros per seat.

10:14.393 --> 10:16.090
Double it.

10:16.343 --> 10:20.102
I know you want to corner the
market on F-14 components, Rene,

10:20.126 --> 10:23.347
but even if the Iranians pay top Euro

10:23.371 --> 10:25.880
by the time we split the
shipment for transport...

10:25.904 --> 10:27.810
We're not splitting the shipment now.

10:27.834 --> 10:30.168
It's all going on La Tortue.

10:30.693 --> 10:33.373
She sails for Hormuz on the 23rd.

10:33.397 --> 10:37.922
If the Americans stop her, you risk losing
not only the components, but the ship.

10:37.946 --> 10:40.142
$68 million and change.

10:40.166 --> 10:44.764
Regine, the U.S. Navy will seize La
Tortue after she enters the Persian Gulf.

10:44.788 --> 10:47.782
Don't you know Americans pay
more to keep their F-14 parts

10:47.806 --> 10:51.246
out of Iranian hands than
Iranians pay to get them.

10:51.270 --> 10:52.582
So...

10:52.784 --> 10:54.323
just double it.

10:55.409 --> 10:57.490
Nice in 20 minutes.

10:58.671 --> 11:00.318
Time to refresh.

11:05.440 --> 11:10.816
A friend in the GRU informs me
that NCIS nipples is quietly trying

11:10.840 --> 11:14.029
to locate a former
Colonel-General Dimitri Borov.

11:15.178 --> 11:17.381
Elle commence Ã  me gonfler.

11:21.688 --> 11:23.131
She is relentless.

11:23.155 --> 11:24.814
Does that surprise you?

11:24.838 --> 11:28.729
She is the first female director
of an armed Federal Agency.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.429
Have they located.

11:31.453 --> 11:34.342
Colonel-General Dimitri Borov?

11:34.366 --> 11:35.425
Not yet.

11:37.887 --> 11:39.516
Perhaps they should.

11:51.043 --> 11:55.031
I've been hacking cabs for 22
years. Never had a fare die on me.

11:55.055 --> 11:59.207
Couple of heart attacks, a suicide
attempt or two, but none of them died.

11:59.231 --> 12:00.221
Till now.

12:00.245 --> 12:02.965
Anyone who does something
for 22 years must love it.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.354
You kidding? It's the
best job in the world!

12:05.378 --> 12:08.155
So now you think I'm crazy,
right? But here's the thing.

12:08.179 --> 12:10.430
My best friend, I met him in the cab.

12:10.454 --> 12:12.960
The guy who does my tax,
I met him in the cab.

12:12.984 --> 12:17.005
Poker buddies, met'em in the cab.
I even met my wife in the cab.

12:17.276 --> 12:19.811
Well, three out of four ain't bad.

12:20.119 --> 12:21.606
This is your statement.

12:21.630 --> 12:23.819
Read it. If you agree, sign it.

12:26.317 --> 12:28.780
I think we should, call for a recount.

12:28.805 --> 12:31.414
- On what?
- Ducky winning the pool.

12:31.438 --> 12:33.969
Gibbs is up in the Director's
office directing, right?

12:33.993 --> 12:36.366
We're working the case. He's not.

12:40.292 --> 12:42.224
Because he's waiting for
me to give him an update.

12:42.248 --> 12:44.596
Which I'm gonna do, as soon as Mr.
Kelly signs his statement and leaves.

12:44.620 --> 12:45.941
I can go?

12:46.520 --> 12:49.281
You can go to the head
or our conference room.

12:49.305 --> 12:51.246
He said I could leave.

12:52.061 --> 12:54.734
Well, what I say doesn't
count when the boss is here.

12:54.758 --> 12:56.674
Like me when the wife is around.

12:56.698 --> 12:58.742
- Mr. Kelly.
- Lead the way.

12:59.919 --> 13:01.283
Follow me.

13:01.307 --> 13:03.101
- Update?
- McGee.

13:05.128 --> 13:07.419
According to Immigration, Hamal Farhan

13:07.443 --> 13:11.277
applied for a student visa
twice and was turned down twice.

13:11.301 --> 13:14.009
Granted a six-month tourist visa.
That was a year and a half ago.

13:14.033 --> 13:16.537
Even if he had it extended for
a year, he's here illegally.

13:16.561 --> 13:19.366
Should we notify
Immigration and deport him?

13:21.412 --> 13:22.805
That's a good one, boss.

13:23.258 --> 13:25.412
Actually, his visa was
extended indefinitely.

13:25.436 --> 13:27.974
Yemen added Farhan to
their Embassy personnel.

13:27.998 --> 13:29.876
What are you trying to
do, make me look bad?

13:29.900 --> 13:31.033
I just read it.

13:31.057 --> 13:32.860
Added as what?

13:35.141 --> 13:36.480
A gardener.

13:37.750 --> 13:38.750
In here.

13:42.231 --> 13:44.023
Anything I can get you, Mr. Kelly?

13:44.222 --> 13:45.991
My cab so I can leave.

13:46.015 --> 13:47.492
To eat or drink?

13:47.516 --> 13:49.734
Philly cheesesteak and
a beer would be nice.

13:49.758 --> 13:51.562
No alcoholic beverages allowed.

13:51.586 --> 13:53.630
I will work on your sandwich.

13:54.391 --> 13:55.785
You gonna lock me in?

13:55.809 --> 13:59.540
No, but there will be an
escort outside the door.

13:59.757 --> 14:01.802
Is that another name for a guard?

14:12.876 --> 14:15.685
Thelma, you're never
gonna believe where I am.

14:16.174 --> 14:18.780
No, I'm not at Kelsey's Bar.

14:22.414 --> 14:23.947
How did he die, Duck?

14:23.971 --> 14:27.742
Quickly, Jethro, as
the meter ticked over

14:27.766 --> 14:31.031
and without the driver even noticing.

14:31.266 --> 14:35.331
And whatever caused his demise
is not evident from my autopsy.

14:35.355 --> 14:41.041
There's no sign of violence, no
lumps, bumps, punctures or holes.

14:41.065 --> 14:42.103
Drug overdose?

14:42.127 --> 14:45.360
Well, I can't say for certain
till I receive Abby's report.

14:45.384 --> 14:50.220
But he didn't die of a cardiac infarction
which is how most overdoses kill.

14:50.244 --> 14:53.024
His heart shows no sign
of coronary artery disease.

14:53.048 --> 14:55.512
In fact, it's in excellent condition,

14:55.536 --> 14:58.759
as can be said of all your organs.

14:58.783 --> 15:00.928
Pity they couldn't
all have been donated.

15:00.952 --> 15:03.002
They were all so healthy.

15:03.331 --> 15:04.399
Poison?

15:04.598 --> 15:08.212
It's the most likely culprit,
but again, I wait Abigail.

15:08.236 --> 15:11.034
I thought you were supposed
to solve these riddles, Duck.

15:11.058 --> 15:12.830
Abby and I like to share.

15:13.663 --> 15:14.713
Right.

15:18.383 --> 15:21.689
That wouldn't have been your
assistant, would it, Director?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.419
I do hate a nagging woman, Duck.

15:23.443 --> 15:26.395
She's only doing her job, Jethro.

15:27.608 --> 15:28.814
Ah, Abby.

15:28.838 --> 15:30.697
Any news on the tox screen?

15:31.134 --> 15:32.853
Abby, Abby, are you there?

15:34.328 --> 15:36.392
Oh, I guess she must have...

15:39.333 --> 15:40.971
gone.

15:42.851 --> 15:45.524
Oh, this cab is bringing back memories:

15:45.548 --> 15:48.858
Cheap vinyl, plastic
divider, dirty floors.

15:50.119 --> 15:54.018
Actually, these floors are pretty
clean. The ones I remember were dirty.

15:54.042 --> 15:57.095
Let me guess. Short-lived
career as a cabbie?

15:57.119 --> 15:59.306
Ah, a short-lived encounter.

16:00.066 --> 16:01.985
Ships in the night.

16:02.552 --> 16:04.130
My first time.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.581
For what?

16:06.432 --> 16:07.807
Front seat or back?

16:08.097 --> 16:10.705
Back. Well, both, kind of.

16:12.424 --> 16:14.922
My first time was in a weapons carrier.

16:15.779 --> 16:16.974
Of course it was.

16:17.318 --> 16:21.294
Where was the cabbie when
this encounter took place?

16:21.318 --> 16:24.047
He was the cabbie, putting
himself through school.

16:24.071 --> 16:25.484
It was his first time, too.

16:25.508 --> 16:28.506
- First time for what?
- Seeing a curling match, Gibbs.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.955
Have you ever seen a curling match?

16:29.979 --> 16:32.347
The pristine ice and those
little brooms that sweep...

16:32.371 --> 16:33.547
That's a clean cab.

16:33.571 --> 16:36.348
So, what killed him, heart attack?

16:36.372 --> 16:38.354
No, Ducky ruled out a heart attack.

16:38.378 --> 16:40.700
Poison looks better all the time.

16:41.124 --> 16:44.782
Well, Major Mass Spectrometer
is working as fast as he can.

16:44.806 --> 16:46.954
Make him work faster, Abby.

16:46.978 --> 16:48.193
Yes, sir.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.494
Running shoe.

16:52.518 --> 16:55.296
Yeah, that impression
matches Farhan's left foot.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.701
The cab must have been cleaned
before he was picked up.

16:57.725 --> 17:01.097
After he hailed the
cab, like most passengers

17:01.121 --> 17:03.398
he didn't sit directly
behind the driver.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.109
Crossed his leg like this.

17:05.134 --> 17:06.111
Then he died.

17:06.135 --> 17:07.785
In a very relaxed position.

17:08.123 --> 17:10.173
May have been a natural death, Gibbs.

17:10.196 --> 17:14.200
I know he was healthy and
young, but it does happen SADS.

17:14.223 --> 17:16.502
No, sad. No S.

17:16.527 --> 17:19.978
No it is SADS. Sudden
Arrhythmia Death Syndrome.

17:20.002 --> 17:21.046
Right. Sorry.

17:21.069 --> 17:22.871
It can leave the heart
looking perfectly normal.

17:22.895 --> 17:25.039
McGee, you check out our cabbie?

17:25.744 --> 17:27.964
Not yet. That is my next task.

17:27.989 --> 17:28.990
Hey, boss.

17:33.888 --> 17:36.864
Five of the seven names found on
the list in Farhan's wallet are dead.

17:36.888 --> 17:38.550
- A hit list?
- When?

17:38.574 --> 17:40.523
First died three weeks ago.

17:40.547 --> 17:42.800
The last... not including
Farhan... Monday.

17:42.824 --> 17:44.712
Kind of rules out
your SADS theory, Ziva.

17:44.736 --> 17:47.106
- SADS?
- Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.115
I know what it is, Ziva.
It's number two on the list.

17:49.139 --> 17:51.652
Sean Price, 24, died of SADS.

17:51.676 --> 17:53.603
- The others?
- Heart attack.

17:53.627 --> 17:56.751
- Or a blown autopsy.
- No autopsy. He was 79.

17:56.775 --> 18:00.301
One car crash, one drowning.
One list, five people.

18:00.325 --> 18:03.927
You and Ziva find the two live names
on this list. Look for a connection.

18:03.951 --> 18:06.614
David Brown and Robert Smith.

18:06.638 --> 18:07.993
There'll be dozens of them.

18:08.017 --> 18:10.441
I read the obits. If there's
a connection, I didn't see it.

18:10.465 --> 18:11.799
There's a connection.

18:11.823 --> 18:13.831
- What?
- They're all dead.

18:15.455 --> 18:19.274
Relax, Thelma, they won't
keep me here overnight.

18:20.088 --> 18:21.591
I'll be out of here soon.

18:22.043 --> 18:23.031
Right, boss?

18:23.055 --> 18:24.280
I'm not your boss.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.937
Right now it sure feels like it.

18:25.961 --> 18:27.416
When'd you have the cab cleaned?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.306
I got it that way from dispatch.

18:29.330 --> 18:31.053
How many fares before Farhan.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.720
- He was my first.
- He was looking over his shoulder?

18:34.643 --> 18:37.880
Till he was sure we weren't
being tailed. Then he relaxed.

18:38.224 --> 18:41.482
Maybe I just thought he
relaxed, seeing how he was dead.

18:42.296 --> 18:44.347
Can I get my cab and go now?

18:44.673 --> 18:45.768
Not yet.

18:46.204 --> 18:47.744
I am very relieved

18:47.768 --> 18:51.055
that none of the deceased
are your friends or relatives.

18:51.079 --> 18:52.566
Hi, may I speak with David Brown?

18:52.590 --> 18:55.150
- Yes, I am certain they are dead.
- Thanks.

18:55.965 --> 18:58.380
Oh, no, no, I wouldn't send flowers.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.369
May I speak with David Brown?

19:00.393 --> 19:04.775
If you wish to send a sympathy card,
I am sure it would be very appreciated.

19:06.015 --> 19:08.689
Well, you have a good life, too.

19:08.713 --> 19:11.728
I wouldn't normally ask you this,
but since you don't know the deceased,

19:11.752 --> 19:14.870
I was wondering if you'd be interested
in subscribing to our DVD club.

19:14.894 --> 19:18.638
It's mostly East German films.
Because I have a very special...

19:19.833 --> 19:22.251
Gets them off the line fast every time.

19:22.275 --> 19:26.412
Hey, boss, 32 David Browns in the
metro area. So far I've talked to four.

19:26.436 --> 19:29.163
41 Robert Smiths, two.

19:29.187 --> 19:31.078
And I notified the Yemen embassy of...

19:31.102 --> 19:32.646
Director Gibbs!

19:33.262 --> 19:36.397
- Your cell phone is off.
- Because I shut it off.

19:36.421 --> 19:39.248
The Yemen embassy has been
calling for the Director.

19:39.272 --> 19:42.176
- Did you tell them she's in Paris?
- Yes.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.307
Good.

19:43.331 --> 19:46.494
I also told them you
were Acting Director.

19:47.073 --> 19:49.914
They're sending an attache
to identify the body.

19:54.743 --> 19:57.249
Yes, that is him, Hamal Farhan.

19:57.273 --> 19:58.684
When will the body be released?

19:58.708 --> 20:01.811
- When we know how he died and why.
- You suspect murder?

20:01.835 --> 20:05.560
I always suspect murder when a healthy
young man dies of no apparent cause.

20:05.584 --> 20:09.138
Finding the cause of death
could take several days.

20:09.555 --> 20:10.604
Weeks.

20:12.332 --> 20:17.061
It is our request that Mr. Farhan be
turned over to the embassy immediately.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.437
Kid must have been a hell of a gardener.

20:20.478 --> 20:22.487
He had no family in America.

20:22.897 --> 20:24.062
We take care of our own.

20:24.086 --> 20:26.241
This time of night, the
embassy sends an e-mail,

20:26.265 --> 20:28.774
not a cultural attache, Dr. Temani.

20:29.522 --> 20:32.125
You are Acting Director
of NCIS, I believe?

20:32.149 --> 20:36.252
Director will be back at the end of
the week if you want to wait around.

20:37.557 --> 20:40.252
Mr. Farhan wanted to attend
an American university,

20:40.276 --> 20:42.913
but was repeatedly
denied a student visa.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.614
So he took up gardening?

20:44.638 --> 20:46.128
Only on paper.

20:46.152 --> 20:50.494
He stops at the embassy every
Friday just to pick up a paycheck.

20:50.518 --> 20:53.161
- He was connected.
- Yes.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.800
The son of one of the
Prime Minister's advisors.

20:55.824 --> 21:00.249
Hamal wanted to learn English
and study American culture,

21:00.273 --> 21:01.518
nothing more.

21:01.542 --> 21:05.263
- Did I say there was?
- No, but I know what you're thinking.

21:05.707 --> 21:08.565
Hamal was not the type to
be involved with terrorism.

21:08.589 --> 21:11.443
He asked to be brought
to NCIS for a reason.

21:11.467 --> 21:13.031
I cannot imagine why.

21:14.261 --> 21:18.348
The last person from your country
who asked to talk to NCIS was killed.

21:18.372 --> 21:21.322
- When was that?
- October 10, 2000.

21:21.346 --> 21:24.456
Two days before the
terrorist attack on USSCole.

21:33.628 --> 21:38.483
Do you know Maury Goldberg, Thomas
West, Adam Zeileg, Sean Price or.

21:38.507 --> 21:40.153
Hamal Farhan?

21:40.177 --> 21:42.253
- Adam West?
- No, not Adam West.

21:42.277 --> 21:44.968
Adam Zeileg or Thomas West.

21:46.303 --> 21:47.710
- You know Burt Ward?
- Yeah, I do.

21:47.734 --> 21:49.878
Really? Holy molars!

21:50.675 --> 21:53.395
No kidding. On The Simpsons? Which one?

21:53.667 --> 21:55.829
Is that the one with the
Muslim guy on the bike?

21:56.136 --> 21:59.673
Thanks for your help, Mr.
Brown. Tell Burt, Tony says hi.

22:00.415 --> 22:02.255
I know, boss. This isn't TV trivia.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.641
A dead man was left on our
door step clutching a hit list.

22:05.665 --> 22:08.423
Well not exactly clutching, but
with a hit list in his wallet,

22:08.447 --> 22:10.424
and we have to find the
two names on the list

22:10.448 --> 22:13.424
that haven't been hit
yet before they are hit.

22:14.148 --> 22:16.839
- No, DiNozzo.
- No?

22:16.863 --> 22:20.520
We have to find the dirt bag
that killed the other five!

22:20.846 --> 22:22.927
- Agent Gibbs?
- What?!

22:23.445 --> 22:25.234
Justice called on the Scoletti case.

22:25.258 --> 22:28.800
They've granted the defense permission
to do their own ballistics test tomorrow.

22:28.824 --> 22:31.576
Tell Special Agent
Gillman this is his case.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.768
As Acting Director, You
have to sign off on it.

22:40.514 --> 22:42.940
We still have those
case files to review.

22:44.190 --> 22:46.272
We can do them later.

22:48.960 --> 22:50.312
Joe Kelly.

22:50.336 --> 22:51.688
Uh, legit.

22:51.712 --> 22:54.506
He's had a IC licence
in D.C. for 22 years.

22:54.530 --> 22:57.360
Other than a couple of minor
traffic violations, he's clean.

22:57.384 --> 22:59.736
He has been here a while.
Should we release him?

22:59.760 --> 23:02.369
- If I wanted him released, McGee...
- You would have told me.

23:02.393 --> 23:05.855
Scoletti's lawyers have a hired gun
coming into check Abby's ballistics.

23:05.879 --> 23:06.856
Tell Abby.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.486
- I'd really rather not.
- It wasn't a request.

23:09.991 --> 23:12.750
- When is the Director returning?
- Sometime tomorrow.

23:12.774 --> 23:14.519
I don't think Gibbs is
going to last that...

23:14.543 --> 23:17.510
- Hello?
- Yes. Mister Smith.

23:17.944 --> 23:20.442
I'm calling from NCIS.

23:21.636 --> 23:24.423
Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

23:25.527 --> 23:28.346
They're questioning the
validity of my ballistics?!

23:28.370 --> 23:30.432
Scoletti's lawyers are desperate.

23:30.456 --> 23:33.427
They're desperate. They're
like drowning men grasping...

23:33.451 --> 23:35.685
At thin polystyrene tubes?

23:35.709 --> 23:38.114
I was going to say straws, but
I do like that idiom better.

23:38.138 --> 23:42.465
Because mine's more accurate. I mean,
does saying, "grasping at straws"

23:42.489 --> 23:46.387
tell you if they're made out of paper
or glass or metal or polystyrene? No!

23:46.411 --> 23:48.846
I pride myself on the
accuracy of my forensics,

23:48.870 --> 23:52.240
and lawyers... lawyers
are questioning it!

23:52.264 --> 23:54.843
Abby, they don't know
you like we know you.

23:54.867 --> 23:57.595
Okay? They're hoping
that you made a mistake,

23:57.619 --> 23:59.616
but when their ballistic
experts don't find any,

23:59.640 --> 24:02.471
that makes your forensics
all the more damning in court.

24:02.495 --> 24:05.361
So please do not let
desperate lawyers grasping

24:05.385 --> 24:09.611
at thin polystyrene
tubes upset you, please?

24:12.517 --> 24:14.076
I love you, McGee.

24:14.709 --> 24:16.279
Not like love you, love you.

24:16.303 --> 24:19.115
Not that I don't love
you, because I do, kind of.

24:19.139 --> 24:22.571
You know, like... like
the way I love puppies.

24:22.595 --> 24:25.889
I could have done
without that comparaison.

24:27.330 --> 24:29.001
But I love puppies.

24:29.381 --> 24:32.963
You'll just have to wait. They
can't hold me here overnight.

24:33.415 --> 24:36.481
My wife doesn't believe
I'm being held by Navy cops.

24:36.505 --> 24:38.882
He's a material witness.

24:39.931 --> 24:41.308
Thanks, pal.

24:41.332 --> 24:44.808
You know how wives are... they don't
trust you as far as they can kick you.

24:44.832 --> 24:46.738
Wouldn't know. Never married.

24:46.762 --> 24:48.349
How did you get away?

24:48.373 --> 24:51.408
After a while, women...
they just don't like me.

24:51.432 --> 24:54.722
- What do you do, leave the toilet lid up?
- I know when they're lying.

24:55.916 --> 24:57.202
Men, too.

25:01.268 --> 25:02.268
From the top.

25:04.020 --> 25:06.245
The guy was my first fare.

25:06.269 --> 25:08.916
Flagged me down outside
Kelsey's Bar on 25th.

25:12.792 --> 25:13.769
Done.

25:13.793 --> 25:15.867
I have a dozen Smiths left.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.593
Want to take half of them?

25:18.707 --> 25:20.031
I don't think so.

25:21.623 --> 25:24.309
- Will make it worth your wow.
- While.

25:24.333 --> 25:27.006
- Not wow.
- Wow makes more sense.

25:27.030 --> 25:29.400
You're right. Wow would be better.

25:29.925 --> 25:31.435
Then you'll help me?

25:31.709 --> 25:32.865
No.

25:34.422 --> 25:36.020
Did you call to apologize?

25:36.295 --> 25:37.498
Yeah.

25:37.522 --> 25:39.734
You're right. I was in a rush.

25:39.951 --> 25:41.437
I should have taken more time.

25:41.461 --> 25:44.422
Me, too. I sprung that house on you.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.340
It was a surprise.

25:46.594 --> 25:48.950
You willing to look at it with me?

25:49.529 --> 25:51.747
Look? Yeah, when?

25:51.771 --> 25:53.074
Saturday.

25:54.033 --> 25:55.282
Deal.

25:56.205 --> 25:57.780
I got to go.

25:58.023 --> 25:59.230
I love you, Tony.

25:59.836 --> 26:01.130
Love you, too, Jeanne.

26:04.712 --> 26:07.061
Come on. You can tell
us what you're feeling.

26:07.085 --> 26:08.884
Stop nagging my baby

26:08.908 --> 26:12.360
or you can plot the mass spectrum
on a graph yourself, McGee.

26:13.213 --> 26:14.263
Perfect.

26:14.679 --> 26:17.248
You know what they say
about the watched pot, right?

26:17.272 --> 26:18.625
Don't you have something to do?

26:18.649 --> 26:22.429
No. Not until Major Mass Spec tells
me if Farhan was poisoned or not.

26:22.453 --> 26:25.867
Be a good boy and go get me Scoletti's
weapon out of the evidence locker.

26:25.891 --> 26:27.938
You gonna run another ballistics test?

26:27.962 --> 26:30.063
No, I've already
quadruple-checked that,

26:30.087 --> 26:32.910
but the serial number was
filed off of the weapon.

26:33.268 --> 26:36.756
I used an acid-etching
solution to lift it up.

26:37.462 --> 26:39.107
I'm going to quadruple check that now.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.622
Abby. You did not make an error.

26:41.646 --> 26:44.760
By the time you get back,
the kettle will be whistling.

26:46.457 --> 26:48.843
If not sooner. Saxitoxin?

26:48.867 --> 26:51.548
- Never heard of it.
- It's a neurotoxin.

26:51.572 --> 26:55.400
It's found in most cases of
paralytic shellfish poisoning.

26:55.888 --> 26:57.316
He ate a bad clam?

26:57.340 --> 26:58.712
I don't know.

27:03.961 --> 27:05.527
What are you looking for?

27:05.789 --> 27:07.002
Gibbs.

27:07.588 --> 27:11.741
He has this uncanny way of just
showing up whenever I make a discovery.

27:11.765 --> 27:14.941
He's a little bit off his game
since he's been playing Director.

27:14.965 --> 27:17.368
Is that so, McGee?

27:18.345 --> 27:20.403
Both of you, get down here.

27:24.042 --> 27:25.947
Saxitoxin is produced

27:25.971 --> 27:29.877
by a single-cell organism that
flourishes in the warm months.

27:29.901 --> 27:33.475
It is eaten by oysters, clams,
mussels, and is responsible

27:33.499 --> 27:36.106
for the deadly phenomenon
known as "red tide".

27:36.715 --> 27:40.544
The poison disrupts the
electrical impulses to the brain,

27:40.568 --> 27:43.878
and the body basically forgets
how to breath, how to live,

27:43.902 --> 27:46.196
and it's practically undetectable.

27:47.101 --> 27:49.467
Good work, my dear.

27:49.491 --> 27:51.527
- Thank you, Ducky.
- You're welcome.

27:51.551 --> 27:53.253
Whenever you two are done.

27:53.886 --> 27:54.942
Yes, well,

27:54.966 --> 27:57.820
six-tenths of a milligram
could kill an adult.

27:57.844 --> 28:00.131
That level is consistent with, well,

28:00.155 --> 28:03.164
for example, improperly prepared fug...

28:04.280 --> 28:07.107
It's a blowfish. Japanese delicacy.

28:07.131 --> 28:08.700
Perhaps death was accidental?

28:08.724 --> 28:10.944
Not likely. His stomach was empty.

28:10.968 --> 28:13.508
And even if it wasn't,
the saxitoxin levels were

28:13.532 --> 28:16.912
a hundred times higher than he could have
possibly consumed by eating shellfish.

28:16.936 --> 28:19.968
There's nothing in nature with
that high of a concentration.

28:20.225 --> 28:21.903
During the 50s,

28:21.927 --> 28:27.315
a suicide pill was synthesized
using contaminated butter clams.

28:27.339 --> 28:30.656
- By who?
- Our old friends, The CIA.

28:37.718 --> 28:39.289
Shepard.

28:39.313 --> 28:41.413
Colonel-General Borov.

28:41.971 --> 28:43.380
Who is this?

28:43.404 --> 28:45.256
I have located him.

28:46.219 --> 28:49.021
Place de la Concorde.

28:49.471 --> 28:51.119
Circle the obelisk.

28:51.143 --> 28:56.348
I will be waiting where Marie
lost her head. Ten minutes.

28:58.707 --> 29:01.072
Place de la Concorde. And hit it.

29:01.096 --> 29:02.565
Yes, Director.

30:38.251 --> 30:40.991
There he is. Pull over.

30:54.745 --> 30:56.565
After Pulp Fiction,

30:56.589 --> 31:00.636
a gun aimed my way in
a car makes me nervous.

31:01.034 --> 31:02.935
Put it away, Hektor.

31:04.904 --> 31:06.976
And turn around, Hektor.

31:07.573 --> 31:10.034
This is to be a private conversation.

31:12.532 --> 31:15.935
- Colonel-General Borov.
- No foreplay?

31:16.043 --> 31:17.401
No time.

31:17.801 --> 31:20.170
So American.

31:21.811 --> 31:23.779
Is La Grenouille in Paris?

31:23.803 --> 31:25.652
That's better.

31:25.676 --> 31:28.277
No. He is in Nice.

31:28.301 --> 31:30.750
I'm joining him later tonight.

31:30.774 --> 31:33.827
Why is the CIA helping me?

31:33.851 --> 31:37.580
Perhaps we believe in righting a wrong.

31:38.991 --> 31:41.623
Colonel-General Borov's address.

31:43.071 --> 31:44.845
He's in a hospital?

31:45.080 --> 31:47.071
Dying of lung cancer.

31:47.271 --> 31:49.461
Pull over by the bridge.

31:51.802 --> 31:55.844
There's an e-ticket in your name
with a visa at Charles de Gaulle.

31:55.868 --> 32:00.317
Aeroflot Flight SU 252 to Moscow.

32:00.341 --> 32:02.313
It departs in three hours.

32:08.056 --> 32:09.680
Au revoir, ChÃ©rie.

33:57.712 --> 34:01.418
We are trying to establish a timeline
of Farhan's final ride, Gibbs.

34:01.442 --> 34:05.061
Taxicab's on board computer
tracked his movements with a GPS,

34:05.085 --> 34:07.913
and determined the fare based
on how many zones it crossed.

34:07.937 --> 34:11.009
Our cabbie did not take the most
direct route from the Embassy.

34:11.033 --> 34:13.036
This is America, Ziva.
Land of opportunity.

34:13.061 --> 34:14.760
No cabbie ever takes the quickest route.

34:14.784 --> 34:17.382
He dropped down along the river,
circumvented the city center.

34:17.407 --> 34:18.476
How much?

34:19.435 --> 34:21.625
$27.65.

34:26.033 --> 34:27.949
Hope you guys are on overtime.

34:27.974 --> 34:31.444
Is this the route you took to
the Navy Yard this afternoon?

34:31.899 --> 34:34.107
- More or less.
- More.

34:34.396 --> 34:36.871
The fare was $27.65.

34:36.895 --> 34:39.452
It does not match the
distance you said you traveled.

34:39.476 --> 34:41.699
There was traffic. I
was trying to avoid it.

34:41.723 --> 34:44.387
Got jammed up. He wasn't
complaining, you know?

34:44.411 --> 34:46.384
Because he was dead.

34:48.864 --> 34:53.735
The wife. I'm going to take this
because she scares me more than you guys.

34:54.362 --> 34:55.353
Thelma?

34:55.377 --> 34:57.888
I made the switch. Now get
us the hell out of here.

34:57.912 --> 34:59.672
I'm trying, Thelma, I'm trying.

34:59.696 --> 35:02.335
Yeah, well, try harder, sweet pea.

35:02.359 --> 35:04.453
I'm pretty sure they're
going to let me go soon.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.974
Well, they'd better, or you're
going to end up like your fare.

35:10.477 --> 35:12.517
Love you, too, sweetheart.

35:13.060 --> 35:14.388
Thelma's really getting worried.

35:14.412 --> 35:15.603
The route.

35:15.627 --> 35:19.574
Okay, so maybe I took the long way
around. What cabbie doesn't now and then?

35:19.598 --> 35:22.764
Report me to the commission. I'll
report myself to the commission.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.294
Just tell me we're done.

35:24.318 --> 35:26.930
Tell me I can get my cab
and go home to Thelma.

35:29.478 --> 35:32.960
Abby's done with the taxi and
he's been here all the day.

35:35.164 --> 35:36.152
Call the front gate.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.037
Thank you. Thank you...

35:40.876 --> 35:42.572
Just go home to your wife.

35:42.596 --> 35:46.666
Did I tell you Thelma and I are
going to take a cruise to the Bahamas?

35:54.666 --> 35:58.865
Bingo. So how did it get there, Abigail?

36:06.541 --> 36:08.025
What are we watching?

36:08.442 --> 36:10.500
It's an NSA decryption program scanning

36:10.524 --> 36:12.642
all possible connections
between people on the list.

36:12.666 --> 36:15.199
There's a five and a three in
all their Social Security numbers.

36:15.223 --> 36:17.981
Except for Farhan, who didn't
have a Social Security card.

36:18.005 --> 36:20.145
I have the numbers
three and five in mine.

36:20.169 --> 36:22.187
- Me, too.
- That's it? No other connections?

36:22.211 --> 36:25.082
- Nope.
- No common churches, social clubs,

36:25.106 --> 36:26.781
schools, fraternities, nothing.

36:26.805 --> 36:30.359
The only place these people
ever met was in the obituaries.

36:31.843 --> 36:34.205
Pull up the full pages
of the obituaries.

36:36.541 --> 36:38.196
Where're your eyes go to?

36:39.300 --> 36:40.518
The photos.

36:40.542 --> 36:42.831
You think their names were
randomly picked from the obits?

36:42.855 --> 36:47.082
Gives the appeance of a hit list. The
only one actually murdered was Farhan.

36:47.106 --> 36:49.083
- Why?
- To distract us.

36:49.107 --> 36:50.634
Gibbs.

36:51.394 --> 36:54.394
Unless this foam grew legs,
something weird is going on.

36:54.418 --> 36:58.083
Not that polrethane foam growing
legs isn't weird in the first place,

36:58.107 --> 37:01.307
but this is the foam that we
found on the floor of the taxi,

37:01.331 --> 37:04.226
- and this foam is exactly the same.
- The point.

37:04.606 --> 37:08.293
Well, I just found this foam
inside the evidence lock-up.

37:11.569 --> 37:12.999
David.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.239
Too late, he's gone.

37:21.185 --> 37:23.685
- Speed it up.
- 15's the limit.

37:24.173 --> 37:26.448
Never had my ass give me orders.

37:26.472 --> 37:29.109
- What?
- Main gate's coming up.

37:31.672 --> 37:34.145
Hi, NCIS call about me?

37:34.169 --> 37:35.454
They did, sir.

37:36.065 --> 37:37.454
Both hands on the wheel.

37:37.478 --> 37:40.114
Okay, okay, whatever you say.

37:40.138 --> 37:41.586
Step out of the taxi.

37:41.610 --> 37:44.021
Hands on the wheel or
step out? I can't do both.

37:44.045 --> 37:45.370
Guess.

37:46.522 --> 37:47.825
Oh, man.

37:49.979 --> 37:51.585
Both hands on the hood.

37:51.609 --> 37:53.273
What is this, Baghdad?

37:54.597 --> 37:56.592
Gibbs! Thank God you're here.

37:56.986 --> 37:58.886
Tell these Girines I can go.

37:59.610 --> 38:02.190
- Clear.
- Clear? It's empty.

38:02.462 --> 38:04.139
- Front or back?
- What?

38:04.163 --> 38:05.353
Which seat?!

38:05.377 --> 38:07.336
Which seat? What are you talking about?

38:07.360 --> 38:10.089
The accomplice you smuggled
into the evidence lock-up.

38:10.113 --> 38:11.779
Accomplice?

38:11.803 --> 38:15.337
Thelma looks like you when she's pissed,
only she doesn't have a gun, thank God.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.922
Front or back?

38:17.374 --> 38:18.822
Front, front.

38:18.876 --> 38:20.125
Name?

38:20.849 --> 38:22.424
Mario Vincetti.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.525
Mario! Special Agent Gibbs. Come out.

38:25.549 --> 38:27.354
Slowly, hands first.

38:27.378 --> 38:29.078
There's no sense in getting...

38:29.694 --> 38:31.794
Don't shoot. I'm coming out.

38:38.351 --> 38:40.342
I said drive faster.

38:40.664 --> 38:42.785
And to think I pitied a murderer.

38:43.163 --> 38:45.835
Murderer? That guy was murdered?

38:46.368 --> 38:49.185
I didn't know. I ain't no murderer.

38:49.228 --> 38:52.829
Mario told me the guy was a stiff they
got from a funeral home. Tell them.

38:52.853 --> 38:55.532
Let Scoletti's lawyers
do the talking, dummy.

38:55.556 --> 38:57.917
Scoletti's lawyers
got us into this mess.

38:57.941 --> 38:58.948
Shut up!

38:58.972 --> 39:01.270
Honest, I didn't know
they killed the guy.

39:01.294 --> 39:02.999
I was going to get ten grand,

39:03.041 --> 39:05.519
take Thelma on a Princess
cruise to the Bahamas.

39:05.543 --> 39:06.660
A second honeymoon.

39:07.810 --> 39:09.475
We never had a first.

39:12.712 --> 39:15.643
Tell her enough with the evil
eye. It reminds me of my mother.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.445
You're comparing me to your mother.

39:17.469 --> 39:20.273
Just the eyes, maybe a
little around the mouth.

39:20.309 --> 39:23.024
Permission to shoot?

39:31.896 --> 39:35.745
And you come all the way from
America to see my grandfather?

39:35.769 --> 39:39.082
Actually, I was in Paris
when I found out he was ill.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.145
He is dying.

39:41.169 --> 39:44.042
This week, perhaps next.

39:44.484 --> 39:45.652
Lung cancer.

39:46.230 --> 39:47.537
I'm sorry.

39:47.856 --> 39:50.897
Still, you must have flown
half the day to get here.

39:50.921 --> 39:53.324
I'm writing my father's biography.

39:53.704 --> 39:56.208
He and the Colonel-General
were close friends.

39:56.232 --> 39:58.062
They were adversaries, yes?

39:58.086 --> 40:00.947
Sometimes adversaries
make the best friends.

40:04.170 --> 40:06.640
Most days the morphine
affects his memory.

40:08.364 --> 40:10.485
Let's hope this isn't one of them.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.682
Stuff the crocus.

40:34.706 --> 40:36.211
Do you have a cigarette?

40:36.235 --> 40:38.971
Cigarettes put you here.

40:38.995 --> 40:43.130
Oh, what are they going
to do? Kill me twice?

40:53.988 --> 40:57.282
It appears to be a good
day. I will find a vase.

41:02.988 --> 41:05.603
Do you have a cigarette?

41:30.703 --> 41:33.142
Your father and I swapped

41:33.166 --> 41:37.129
Cuban cigars for American cigarettes.

41:43.304 --> 41:45.057
Like vodka.

41:45.081 --> 41:49.496
It does not burn so
much the second time.

41:51.929 --> 41:56.504
You... did not come all this way...

41:57.029 --> 41:59.981
to watch an old man die.

42:00.005 --> 42:01.492
No.

42:06.240 --> 42:08.479
I came for your signature.

42:09.113 --> 42:10.953
What does it say?

42:10.977 --> 42:16.024
That you verified the
destruction of Warsaw Pact weapons

42:16.048 --> 42:18.196
that were in fact acquired

42:18.220 --> 42:22.465
by an arms dealer
known as La Grenouille.

42:23.753 --> 42:26.365
Are you angry at your father?

42:26.441 --> 42:29.258
No. Why would you even think that?

42:32.899 --> 42:36.935
We had to mutually verify.

42:37.494 --> 42:40.953
La Grenouille paid him, too.

42:41.366 --> 42:42.471
That's a lie.

42:42.495 --> 42:45.845
A dying man does not lie.

42:48.078 --> 42:49.919
Ask your father.

42:49.943 --> 42:51.915
My father's dead.

42:53.413 --> 42:55.658
He beat me to it.

42:56.996 --> 42:59.539
- When?
- 12 years ago.

43:02.345 --> 43:04.094
The old fox.

43:05.557 --> 43:10.129
One last move on the game, huh?

43:11.610 --> 43:15.665
My father has been dead since '95.

43:22.745 --> 43:26.118
He stood where you stand...

43:27.245 --> 43:29.597
three weeks ago,

43:29.621 --> 43:32.951
smoking a cigar.
