00:18.912 --> 00:20.903
It's alive!

00:39.232 --> 00:41.223
We were playing with
Pandapple's ball,

00:41.301 --> 00:42.996
but we lost it.

00:43.069 --> 00:44.366
Here comes Hello Kitty.

00:44.437 --> 00:45.529
She'll know what to do.

00:45.605 --> 00:47.869
Hello, Badtz-maru and
Keroppi.

00:47.941 --> 00:49.966
Hello Kitty,
you have to help us.

00:50.043 --> 00:51.806
We lost Pandapple's ball.

00:51.878 --> 00:52.845
What do we do?

00:52.912 --> 00:54.436
This is a big problem.

00:54.514 --> 00:59.110
Hurt feelings are the worst
kind... eehhhhh!

01:01.087 --> 01:03.419
Eehhhhh!

01:17.337 --> 01:19.771
Ah! Oh!

01:19.839 --> 01:22.569
Hurt feelings are the worst
kind...

01:25.512 --> 01:29.346
This is decaf!

01:32.485 --> 01:33.315
Why did we stop?

01:33.386 --> 01:35.013
I-I arranged it.

01:35.088 --> 01:37.215
Will you marry me?

01:37.290 --> 01:38.882
Oh! Wow.

01:38.958 --> 01:40.289
No.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.691
Oh.

01:41.761 --> 01:44.286
Uh... oh.

02:07.721 --> 02:10.281
Yo, Mick, I can't see
nothing.

02:10.357 --> 02:12.018
You got to open my eye.

02:12.092 --> 02:13.889
Cut me, Mick.
Cut me.

02:18.465 --> 02:20.092
Oh, I only got one eye, Mick.

02:20.166 --> 02:21.064
Listen to me, kid.

02:21.134 --> 02:22.499
Don't worry about that.

02:22.569 --> 02:23.501
All right.

02:23.570 --> 02:24.434
Here we go.

02:29.743 --> 02:31.574
Good job, kid!

02:31.644 --> 02:32.542
That's right!

02:32.612 --> 02:35.137
You got him!

02:36.116 --> 02:38.016
Rocky, what were you thinking
about when you...

02:38.084 --> 02:39.244
Adrian!

02:39.319 --> 02:40.217
Rocky!

02:40.286 --> 02:41.253
Adrian!

02:41.321 --> 02:43.152
Aah!

02:43.223 --> 02:45.487
We now return to
"Two and a Half Men."

02:47.327 --> 02:50.626
This isn't funny!

02:51.531 --> 02:52.520
I love you, Thelma.

02:52.599 --> 02:54.464
I love you, Louise.

03:10.049 --> 03:12.574
Oh, my god, Louise!

03:12.652 --> 03:16.179
My shinbone's wedged up in my
pelvis!

03:16.256 --> 03:17.223
Oh!

03:18.792 --> 03:20.191
I can't move.

03:20.260 --> 03:21.557
Oh, no!

03:21.628 --> 03:23.858
Know what would feel super
comfortable right now?

03:23.930 --> 03:24.760
What, darling?

03:24.831 --> 03:25.661
Prison.

03:25.732 --> 03:26.596
Oh, god!

03:26.666 --> 03:28.497
Prison sounds so good.

03:28.568 --> 03:31.537
Three square meals,
an hour of sunshine every day.

03:31.604 --> 03:32.935
And being able to walk.

03:33.006 --> 03:35.668
In retrospect, our murder
trial could have taken years.

03:35.742 --> 03:38.176
We could have been out on bail,
even.

03:38.244 --> 03:40.735
Maybe even gotten off on a
technicality.

03:40.814 --> 03:41.644
Yeah!

03:41.714 --> 03:43.045
Don't give up hope.

03:43.116 --> 03:44.549
We ain't dead yet.

03:44.617 --> 03:45.743
Maybe they can fix us up

03:45.819 --> 03:47.252
and give us robot parts or
something.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.753
Yeah!

03:48.822 --> 03:52.918
Them cops should be airlifting
us out of here any minute now.

03:58.965 --> 04:00.091
Oh, hell.

04:00.166 --> 04:04.330
That was the most heroic and
noble thing I've ever seen.

04:05.405 --> 04:07.032
What's that noise?

04:07.106 --> 04:11.008
Just the wind...
The wind of freedom.

04:11.077 --> 04:14.513
This is Martha!

04:15.248 --> 04:18.046
Honored scientists,
distinguished colleagues,

04:18.117 --> 04:21.142
members of the press,
by the power vested in me,

04:21.221 --> 04:25.055
I hereby announce that Pluto is
no longer a planet.

04:25.124 --> 04:25.954
What?!

04:26.025 --> 04:27.253
You can't just change that.

04:27.327 --> 04:30.228
Well, I just did it, sucka!

04:30.296 --> 04:34.926
Also, "A" is no longer a vowel,
North no longer a direction.

04:35.001 --> 04:36.400
And oh, your sister?

04:36.469 --> 04:37.868
No longer a virgin.

04:37.937 --> 04:39.529
Hi-oh!

04:39.606 --> 04:41.506
Who actually gave him that
power?

04:50.049 --> 04:52.313
Leonard, how could you?!

04:52.385 --> 04:53.511
Adultery is a sin.

04:53.586 --> 04:55.816
Not anymore it's not,
sweetie!

04:55.889 --> 04:57.550
Plus, Nebraska's no longer a
state,

04:57.624 --> 04:58.921
Fuji's no longer a mountain,

04:58.992 --> 05:01.256
and pie... pie!
No longer has carbs.

05:01.327 --> 05:03.295
Gotta fly!

05:12.038 --> 05:13.528
Stop or we'll shoot!

05:13.606 --> 05:16.575
No, you won't, because babies
no longer grow up to be cowboys,

05:16.643 --> 05:18.338
black guys are no longer longer,

05:18.411 --> 05:20.311
and bullets are no longer
deadly.

05:20.380 --> 05:22.814
Give it to me...

05:24.250 --> 05:25.945
So I'm guessing he only had
the power in theory.

05:26.019 --> 05:28.579
Yeah, I'm guessing you're
right.

05:28.655 --> 05:31.920
You gots to eat lightning and
crap thunder.

05:31.991 --> 05:33.356
So gets out to the store

05:33.426 --> 05:35.860
and picks up some lightnin'
pops cereal.

05:35.929 --> 05:38.454
And ask your parents to get one
of them new thunder-proof

05:38.531 --> 05:43.127
crappin' bowls for the toilet
room, because Mickey loves ya.

05:43.202 --> 05:45.363
Oh, yeah.
Cook, baby! Cook!

05:45.438 --> 05:47.406
Once we get done selling all
this crystal meth,

05:47.473 --> 05:49.168
we're gonna be on easy street,

05:49.242 --> 05:51.176
and we're gonna be fucking
laughing!

05:51.244 --> 05:52.302
Laughing is fun.

05:52.378 --> 05:54.437
You're the smartest guy I...

05:56.149 --> 05:58.640
Oh, man.

06:00.286 --> 06:02.277
I am Crystar!

06:02.355 --> 06:03.549
Whoa!

06:03.623 --> 06:07.218
That icicle is talking to us!

06:07.360 --> 06:11.387
My home world, Crystalean, is
under attack by the evil Moltar!

06:11.464 --> 06:13.227
I've traveled through time and
space

06:13.299 --> 06:14.561
to find other crystal warriors

06:14.634 --> 06:16.864
who can aid me in my
quest for peace!

06:16.936 --> 06:18.927
Are you Crystal warriors?

06:19.005 --> 06:20.563
Yeah.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.664
Oh, yeah.

06:23.176 --> 06:24.336
Whoa!

06:24.410 --> 06:26.401
Welcome to Crystalean.

06:26.479 --> 06:27.446
Now, we haven't much time.

06:27.513 --> 06:30.107
We must stop Moltar before...

06:31.150 --> 06:34.210
After we smoke this dude, we
should smoke his whole world!

06:35.288 --> 06:37.313
If this guy was their greatest
hero,

06:37.390 --> 06:40.518
I would love to meet their
greatest "heroine. "

06:44.364 --> 06:47.595
This is scrumptious!

06:49.168 --> 06:50.135
Ugh!

06:50.203 --> 06:51.033
Aren't you heading into the
office?

06:51.104 --> 06:53.299
Do I look like I'm heading
into the office?

06:53.373 --> 06:55.307
Well, what if you get a
repair call?

06:55.375 --> 06:57.775
Oh, you're hilarious!

06:58.411 --> 07:02.245
Let's hear it for
Jokey McShut the fuck up!

07:02.315 --> 07:03.475
Oh, go fuck yourself!

07:03.549 --> 07:05.107
If you're unhappy,
then just quit.

07:05.184 --> 07:07.311
Great idea, retard!

07:07.387 --> 07:08.684
And who's gonna pay the mortgage

07:08.755 --> 07:10.814
in this dump of a shit shack
you call a home?

07:10.890 --> 07:12.585
You know those fucking
washers never break down,

07:12.659 --> 07:13.785
and you are the one who said

07:13.860 --> 07:15.452
you would use that time for your
writing.

07:15.528 --> 07:19.259
And I haven't seen page one,
Ernest Heming-shit-head.

07:19.332 --> 07:20.458
Oh!

07:20.533 --> 07:22.763
Oh, god, honey,
I-I'm so sorry.

07:22.835 --> 07:23.699
Don't touch me!

07:23.770 --> 07:25.237
I don't know you anymore.

07:25.304 --> 07:27.238
I'm taking the kids and
I'm going to my mother's!

07:27.306 --> 07:28.967
Don't call us!

07:29.042 --> 07:31.772
Wait! Wait!

07:31.844 --> 07:36.338
Why don't they ever need
service?

07:36.416 --> 07:38.884
They never break down!

07:38.951 --> 07:40.714
But I do!

07:44.190 --> 07:48.354
This is all your fault!

07:51.464 --> 07:53.762
Give us a kiss, baby.

08:03.042 --> 08:03.872
Are you sure?

08:03.943 --> 08:04.773
Yeah.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.643
Damn these Laff-a-lympics.

08:09.716 --> 08:12.150
Even though we cheat,
we always lose.

08:12.218 --> 08:14.618
But not this time.

08:16.556 --> 08:17.648
Hey!

08:17.724 --> 08:18.952
Whoo!

08:19.025 --> 08:22.426
I can stop you, for I am smarter
than the average bear!

08:22.495 --> 08:23.826
What's going on, Yogi?

08:23.896 --> 08:28.390
Boo Boo, you fucking bear of
average intelligence.

08:35.842 --> 08:37.832
Well, g... oh!

08:44.884 --> 08:46.283
They're gone!

08:46.352 --> 08:48.252
They're all gone, even.

08:48.321 --> 08:50.118
We have a list of names.

08:50.189 --> 08:52.623
All had a hand in planning
Munich.

08:52.692 --> 08:54.751
Well, then, what are we
waiting for?

08:56.195 --> 08:57.685
Let's get it on!

08:57.764 --> 08:59.231
I think we'll go with a
different,

08:59.298 --> 09:01.289
more subtle talking
dog with this one.

09:01.367 --> 09:03.597
Let me at 'em!
Let me at 'em!

09:03.669 --> 09:10.233
I'll get 'em with puppy...
powe-r-r-r-r-r!

09:10.309 --> 09:11.241
He was on the list.

09:17.016 --> 09:18.574
Like, good morning, dude!

09:18.651 --> 09:19.743
Hey, Scoob!

09:19.819 --> 09:21.753
Like, what the fuck are you
doing, man?

09:21.821 --> 09:23.083
Sorry, Raggy.

09:23.156 --> 09:24.851
My rafety rasn't ron.

09:27.293 --> 09:29.386
Do you know why we're here?

09:29.462 --> 09:30.861
<i>Why you're here?</i>

09:30.930 --> 09:32.761
<i>I don't know why I'm here.</i>

09:32.832 --> 09:35.733
There weren't any better
Hanna-Barbera villains

09:35.802 --> 09:38.032
to round out the really rottens
but me?

09:38.104 --> 09:39.332
Who the hell am I?

09:39.405 --> 09:42.203
Aah!

09:42.775 --> 09:47.303
Oh, what a waste that would
be.

09:47.380 --> 09:48.779
Ow!

09:50.283 --> 09:52.513
Oops! Wrong club!

09:53.219 --> 09:56.120
Oh, order.

10:00.226 --> 10:03.354

from...

10:10.236 --> 10:13.694
Captain Cavema-a-a-n!

10:13.773 --> 10:15.764
Should we accept the charges?

10:20.313 --> 10:25.341
Did we rever really arromprish

10:26.752 --> 10:28.720
Mmm! Yum yum!
