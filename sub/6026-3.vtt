WEBVTT

00:08.039 --> 00:09.041
This is a good buyout.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.248
It's way better than what
Gavin offered before.

00:11.320 --> 00:14.449
And our packages include
nice salaries, cash earn-outs,

00:14.520 --> 00:17.729
stock in Hooli, which vests after
only four years of working there.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.848
I mean, this seems
like a pretty good deal, right?

00:19.920 --> 00:23.322
Hooli?
You really think we'd go work for Hooli?

00:23.440 --> 00:25.090
What the fuck is wrong with you, Richard?

00:25.160 --> 00:26.810
What other options do we have?

00:27.760 --> 00:30.047
We need serious funding
to go up against Nucleus,

00:30.120 --> 00:31.531
and we don't have that.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.126
- So, listen...
- I will listen

00:34.200 --> 00:36.328
to the sound of you chortling on my balls.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.563
- Okay.
- Richard, I'm an independent businessman.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.008
Emphasis on "independent" and "business."

00:43.080 --> 00:44.491
And "man," come to think of it.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.971
Count me out.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.202
Actually, you're not
being offered employment at Hooli.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.645
They'd give you a full buyout.

00:50.640 --> 00:51.766
How big?

00:51.840 --> 00:54.525
Okay, maybe I'm not explaining this right.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.683
I mean, when you heard Gavin Belson
say it, it sounds much clearer.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.967
He's saying, rather than
put us out of business,

01:00.080 --> 01:05.405
he'd prefer to just take us
and make us part of his, um, Hoo...

01:05.480 --> 01:07.164
Okay, that does sound bad.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.642
But, look, you just had to be there, okay?
He's very articulate.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.802
Richard, you didn't leave your drink
unattended around Gavin, did you?

01:14.880 --> 01:16.370
Yeah, you don't sound like yourself.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.920
I'm fine. And for what it's worth,

01:19.000 --> 01:21.651
Monica thinks
this is the right thing for us to do.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.446
What?

01:23.960 --> 01:26.247
You told Monica about this
before you told us?

01:26.320 --> 01:27.685
I don't know, Gilfoyle.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.764
I guess I thought that Monica would
actually give this rational thought

01:30.840 --> 01:33.684
as opposed to ordering me
to chortle her balls.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.081
Guys, Richard's right.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.362
It's a pretty good deal,
all things considered,

01:38.840 --> 01:41.525
and, Richard, I'd
understand if you took it.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.931
Thank you, Jared.

01:43.040 --> 01:47.443
But Hooli was like an abusive spouse to me.

01:47.520 --> 01:52.321
You know, like that guy who married
Julia Roberts in Sleeping with the Enemy?

01:52.400 --> 01:54.448
It was dehumanizing.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.727
But then, you, Richard,
you pulled me out of the life

01:56.800 --> 01:59.406
and you gave me hope
and you gave me a sense of self-worth.

01:59.480 --> 02:02.086
Like Richard Gere did to Julia Roberts
in Pretty Woman.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.685
- This is weird.
- Every day here

02:03.760 --> 02:06.001
has been like that shopping-spree scene.

02:06.080 --> 02:07.730
- I'm putting on hats.
- Okay.

02:08.479 --> 02:10.562
Julia Roberts aside,

02:10.639 --> 02:14.440
are you guys saying
that you'd rather me let Pied Piper die?

02:16.240 --> 02:19.289
'Cause that's what's going to happen
if we don't take this deal.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.761
Face it, Gavin has us cornered.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.370
He has you cornered.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.602
Yeah, we can just go work on our apps.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.245
Sorry, I'm not going to go work for Hooli.

02:28.320 --> 02:32.006
Same for me,
except for the part about being sorry.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.368
And this buyout sucks.
I'll have nothing to do with it.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.761
If you're going to go at this one,

02:39.840 --> 02:42.571
it sounds like you're going
to have to go at it alone, hoss.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.763
Okay, so if I go to Hooli,
you don't want your check?

02:45.840 --> 02:47.763
Of course I want my check.
What are you, insane?

02:47.840 --> 02:52.323
But I think it's important for me to show
my dissatisfaction by walking out on you.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.848
Richard, I'd understand if you took it,

02:57.920 --> 03:00.605
but watching you end up over there
would break my heart.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.521
What, like Julia Roberts
from My Best Friend's Wedding?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.250
I never saw it.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.289
Richard Hendricks.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.081
What's happening?

03:39.160 --> 03:42.243
Russ Hanneman. True pleasure to meet you.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.561
Oh, yeah, I think I recognize you from TV.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.290
Yeah, you do.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.727
Uh, how do you know who I am?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.643
Good question. No reason I would.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.371
But I watched your whole
TechCrunch thing online, twice.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.010
That whole spazz thing you did...

03:57.240 --> 03:58.730
That was fucking priceless.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.410
So I called the Pied Piper number,

04:00.480 --> 04:02.926
and somebody said
you were heading over to Hooli.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.002
The guy sounded like he was
either Chinese or retarded.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.684
Uh, Man-Yang.

04:06.760 --> 04:07.921
Yeah, I don't know what that means.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.402
You know, Richard, back before I blew up,
I got fucked with, too.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.727
You think you're the first guy
to take this ride?

04:13.800 --> 04:15.768
You're hot, you're sued,

04:15.840 --> 04:18.411
then the guy suing you
offers you a buyout, am I right?

04:19.000 --> 04:22.083
Wow. Yeah, actually you're exactly right.
That's what's happening.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.527
- Like my ride?
- Uh...

04:24.640 --> 04:26.881
They don't make it in this color.
They did it just for me.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.725
Guys in this town don't have the
balls to drive a car like this.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.724
They're billionaires
and they drive fuckin' Priuses.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.131
Why?

04:34.200 --> 04:36.441
I think mainly just environmental concerns.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.126
They're all lemmings, Richard.
Everyone in this town is.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.441
Just look at them. Lemming, lemming.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.601
Okay.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.404
I scratched my car.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.887
It's the rivet in my pants.
These are cool pants, too.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.124
Fuck, that's a deep scratch.
That will not buff out.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.884
Motherfucker! Fuck it.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.804
Let me ask you a question, Richard.
Have you ever had beef?

04:58.880 --> 05:00.962
Like, with someone, like fighting?

05:01.040 --> 05:03.327
- No, the food.
- Oh. Yeah.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.811
No, you haven't. Get in.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.962
_kay.
- Giddy up!

05:09.240 --> 05:10.526
- You in?
- Almost.

05:10.600 --> 05:11.965
- Let's do this, Richard.
- Okay.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.161
Shit. "D." Drive!

05:16.240 --> 05:18.527
Come on, fuck you! Drive!

05:21.880 --> 05:23.484
Which is why I counsel
any young founder today

05:23.560 --> 05:28.168
to pursue your dream not for profit
or valuation or material wealth,

05:28.240 --> 05:29.969
but for the good of humanity.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.963
Which is easy for you to say,
being a billionaire.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.522
Let me change the subject. I have...

05:36.600 --> 05:37.601
I don't care for your tone, Kara.

05:37.680 --> 05:42.766
I'm getting a little tired of this bias
against the leaders of our industry.

05:42.840 --> 05:46.322
I'm continually creating jobs
and helping people,

05:46.400 --> 05:48.050
and I'm tired of getting slapped for it.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.528
I didn't steal the money I have,
and I resent being treated like I did.

05:51.600 --> 05:55.844
You know, there is a climate in this
country that is very dangerous.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.082
It's dangerous out there for billionaires?

05:59.480 --> 06:02.165
There's that attitude again, Kara.

06:02.240 --> 06:03.890
Billionaires are people, too.

06:03.960 --> 06:08.522
We are leaders in technology,
in industry, in finance.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.045
Look at history.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.249
Do you know who else
vilified a tiny minority

06:13.320 --> 06:16.642
of financiers
and progressive thinkers called the Jews?

06:17.800 --> 06:23.170
Wait a minute. Did you just compare the
treatment of billionaires in America today

06:23.240 --> 06:25.891
to the plight of the Jews in Nazi Germany?

06:25.960 --> 06:27.371
Absolutely.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.327
One could argue that billionaires
are actually treated worse.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.361
And we didn't even do anything wrong.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.851
We're an even smaller minority.
There's a lot more of them.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.166
These are facts.

06:45.480 --> 06:46.481
So then it hits me.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.767
We take this thing called "the radio"

06:48.840 --> 06:52.083
and put it on this new thing
called "the Internet."

06:52.160 --> 06:54.049
And no one was doing it. No one.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.009
So we started Hoovering up the deals.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.082
Eat this, open your mouth.
Open your mouth. Good.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.606
Eat it, eat it. Don't chew,
just let it dissolve.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.841
- Hold.
- This is very hot.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.410
Hold.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.960
It just think it's physically impossible
for it to dissolve in my mouth.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.849
Hold. Now chew, chew, chew!

07:09.640 --> 07:11.210
It's very hot. It's good, it's good.

07:11.280 --> 07:13.806
Good? It's the fucking best.
This whole place is.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.963
You call this place and they don't know
you, they pretend they don't speak English.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.286
You see a white face in here?
No, you don't.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.690
Anyway, next thing you know, we IPO, stock
triples in a day and AOL gobbles us up.

07:23.760 --> 07:27.845
All of a sudden,
I'm 22 years young and I'm worth 1.2 B.

07:27.920 --> 07:32.801
Now a couple decades later,
I'm worth 1.4. You do the math.

07:34.200 --> 07:38.444
Okay. Well, that's a gain
of $200 million over 20 years.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.289
16.66 repeating.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.682
That's less than 1% return.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.888
Inflation is, like, 1.7.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.486
I think CDs are 2%.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.040
So that's less than a CD.

07:52.200 --> 07:54.487
Well, no one ever got laid
putting money in the bank. Am I right?

07:54.560 --> 07:57.848
Those bad boys right there, they're all you.
You gotta flip 'em over. That side's done.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.810
Listen, Richard, I want to back you.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.008
You build whatever the
fuck you've got going

08:03.080 --> 08:05.526
in that crazy, fucked-up,
genius brain up there.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.206
It's all up to you.
I'm white glove, hands the fuck off.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.930
Let's make you a billion dollars.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.650
Let's make me a billion more.
How's that sound?

08:11.760 --> 08:14.206
You're not worried about the lawsuit?

08:14.280 --> 08:17.284
Shit, no. I got three nannies suing me
right now, one of them for no reason.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.361
So come on, let's do this.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.721
Let's kick Gavin Belson's teeth in at CES.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.848
And then when you're
really worth something,

08:24.920 --> 08:27.844
I'm gonna take you back
to those same spineless VCs who said no,

08:27.920 --> 08:31.447
and I'm gonna shove you
right up their assholes.

08:33.760 --> 08:34.760
Um...

08:34.840 --> 08:36.683
That's a very enticing offer.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.889
And I wish I didn't have to do this Hooli
thing, but I should probably at least...

08:39.960 --> 08:44.648
"Should"? No, no, Richard.
Don't do what you should do.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.721
Do what you want.

08:47.680 --> 08:51.082
I mean, should I pay 800 bucks
for that tiny piece of meat?

08:51.160 --> 08:54.607
Of course not. But I do it anyway.
Because I want it.

08:55.280 --> 08:59.080
Simple question, Richard,
"What do you want?"

09:02.200 --> 09:06.888
Gentlemen, what's the update on the apps?
Or the app-date, if you will?

09:06.960 --> 09:08.405
I will not.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.448
Here's my app-date.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.922
I was excited to work on it,
and then I looked at it with fresh eyes.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.562
Wajeed was right. It's really shitty.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.880
But I bought your pitch.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.530
Yeah, you fucked up, too.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.841
My app is still great.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.446
But in the time that we've been
clicking around with Pied Piper,

09:26.520 --> 09:29.922
ten other apps that basically
do the exact same thing have come out.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.651
Guys, if I list you as references,

09:32.720 --> 09:34.927
can I count on you
to say nice things about me?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.047
Be honest.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.441
Do you want me to be honest or nice?

09:48.880 --> 09:50.609
What, did you get
a parking ticket or something?

09:56.840 --> 09:58.729
Yeah, I still can't see it.
Could you use your mouth?

10:00.160 --> 10:01.889
All right. Just read it.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.727
- $5 million?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.805
You guys are not going back to Hooli,
and neither am I.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.126
How the fuck did you get that?

10:11.200 --> 10:14.249
Russ Hanneman?

10:14.320 --> 10:16.322
Oh, Monica, I see you got my text.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.811
Are you out of your mind?

10:17.880 --> 10:20.281
Nice to see you, too, and, no, I'm not.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.091
You're putting your entire future

10:23.160 --> 10:26.926
in the hands of the man
who put radio on the Internet?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.685
I can only assume
that he mentioned that to you.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.330
It may have come up.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.121
Oh, this guy. That's the guy?

10:35.200 --> 10:36.725
Yeah, that's the guy.

10:36.800 --> 10:41.806
Does he actually smile like that with
his upper and lower teeth at the same time?

10:41.880 --> 10:43.564
The guy is a joke.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.766
How does he even do that?

10:44.840 --> 10:48.003
He's a boorish, pompous,
womanizing douchebag

10:48.080 --> 10:52.244
who got lucky, like, 20 years ago
and hasn't done anything since then.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.086
Sounds like Erlich.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.640
Sounds like he knows who he is
and he doesn't apologize for it.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.330
So he's a joke. Who cares?

10:58.400 --> 11:02.849
This joke is willing to give us $5 million
to fund Pied Piper.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.161
And he doesn't own anything.
This whole thing is a loan.

11:05.240 --> 11:08.687
Yeah, the demand note
is structured as a loan.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.923
But he does have the option
to take repayment in the form of equity,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.241
and he does get two board seats
right off the bat.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.727
Yeah.
Which means you won't get rid of him, ever.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.371
If you succeed,
he gets a huge chunk of Pied Piper

11:19.440 --> 11:23.445
and if you fail, this lunatic has
ratchets to seize control of the company.

11:24.280 --> 11:27.489
Love it or hate it,
at least Hooli is a real company.

11:27.560 --> 11:29.005
You should take their offer.

11:29.080 --> 11:30.605
I should. I should.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.369
But I'm tired of doing what I should do,

11:33.440 --> 11:35.681
and I kind of want to start doing
what I want to do.

11:35.760 --> 11:40.084
And what I want to do is
be a self-centered, irrational asshole

11:40.160 --> 11:43.448
that doesn't compromise
on anything, at all, ever.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.522
And when Pied Piper is a big fucking deal,

11:45.640 --> 11:48.610
Russ is going to take us back
to all those VCs who passed on us

11:48.680 --> 11:51.286
and shove us right up
their fucking assholes.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.081
What?

11:55.160 --> 11:57.686
Yeah, I don't want any
part of that last bit.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.649
It sounded better when Russ said it.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.724
Again, I am not good at quoting in context.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.690
It doesn't matter. I'm going to...

12:05.760 --> 12:07.205
I'm going to call Ron LaFlamme,

12:07.280 --> 12:09.886
and I'm going to tell him
that we're taking Russ's money.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.724
Okay, so I'm supposed to tell Laurie Bream

12:11.800 --> 12:15.964
that she is publicly co-invested
with Russ fucking Hanneman?

12:16.040 --> 12:18.884
So, you'd rather me
sell my soul to Gavin Belson

12:18.960 --> 12:22.248
than you just having
an awkward conversation with your boss?

12:22.320 --> 12:24.448
Oh, thanks, Monica.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.887
The guy has calf implants, Richard.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.610
How do they look?

12:29.320 --> 12:31.926
Everyone on Twitter is saying
I'm an anti-Semite. You were there.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.447
I was.
And what I saw was an anti anti-Semite.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.320
Hello? Did you hear from Hendricks?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.286
What do you mean
he went with someone else?

12:42.360 --> 12:43.771
Who did he go with?

12:45.320 --> 12:46.924
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.488
- Russ Hanneman?
- That's right.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.801
The Russ Hanneman with whom I am familiar?

12:57.920 --> 12:59.285
Yes.

12:59.360 --> 13:02.807
That is with whom they chose to go?
Russ Hanneman?

13:02.880 --> 13:03.961
Yes.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.726
He's a vulgar human being.
He's utterly distasteful.

13:10.800 --> 13:14.566
And it would not be inaccurate to say

13:15.040 --> 13:16.371
that we at Raviga

13:17.800 --> 13:20.451
are now co-investors

13:21.240 --> 13:22.810
with Russ Hanneman.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.963
- I tried to talk him out of it. I did, but...
- Mmm-hmm.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.646
You know what?

13:28.720 --> 13:31.371
Peter used to say
that every successful company

13:31.440 --> 13:35.525
could look back at a defining moment
early on where they would have died

13:35.600 --> 13:38.524
had it not been for
the courage and the tenacity

13:38.600 --> 13:43.322
and maybe the insanity of one
visionary person who put it all on the line

13:43.400 --> 13:45.607
even though it seemed
like a huge mistake at the time.

13:45.720 --> 13:49.805
A moment where all the metrics
and the numbers didn't mean anything.

13:49.880 --> 13:54.681
It was all about the emotion. It was
about belief, rational or irrational.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.250
And I think...

13:57.720 --> 14:00.769
I hope that I just witnessed that.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.762
I did not understand
any of what you just said.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.761
Oh...

14:08.840 --> 14:09.887
- None of it?
- None of it.

14:09.960 --> 14:14.682
I will not interact with Russ Hanneman
in any way. Is that clear?

14:14.760 --> 14:16.046
It is, Laurie.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.125
I feel very strongly
that you should have prevented this.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.851
- This exchange is now over.
- Okay, but I...

14:22.920 --> 14:24.649
This exchange is now over, thank you.

14:29.440 --> 14:30.885
Well, Richard?

14:30.960 --> 14:33.884
Firstly, congratulations
on finally being funded.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.760
I hope you took a little time out
to enjoy this moment and celebrate.

14:37.840 --> 14:39.001
I certainly did.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.043
- You did?
- I did indeed.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.770
I celebrated earlier this morning.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.529
You did, this morning?

14:47.240 --> 14:48.810
Oh, yeah.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.127
But now it's down to business.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.807
We have a huge amount of work to do
between now and January.

15:00.640 --> 15:03.484
I know $5 million sounds
like a lot of money,

15:03.560 --> 15:06.245
but even if we set
our burn rate conservatively,

15:06.320 --> 15:08.402
it's only going to last 18 months.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.245
Litigation wipes out half our funds
right off the bat.

15:11.320 --> 15:15.006
And we have to stand up servers,
pay for financial and HR,

15:15.080 --> 15:18.766
pay LaFlamme, and payroll alone
is going to be pretty hefty.

15:18.840 --> 15:23.243
Did you see the hiring proposals
that Dinesh and Gilfoyle submitted?

15:23.320 --> 15:25.766
- No.
- They're untenable.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.367
Well, I need four web-app devs,
two front end, two back end.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.762
I need a guy to turn your ref code
into a production-quality library.

15:32.840 --> 15:36.367
I need two more guys
to port the decompression libraries,

15:36.440 --> 15:39.410
do JavaScript, iOS, Android,

15:39.480 --> 15:43.041
and I need a few more guys
to build out our APIs,

15:43.120 --> 15:45.771
so I need all those guys.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.406
Ditto. I need every one
of those guys on my list.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.290
Okay, it's just that there's...
That's 15 people each.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.169
I mean, that's like
an entire division at Facebook.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.208
Fine, I could do it with 12.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.647
I could do it with 11
because I'm a better leader than Dinesh.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.290
Okay, great.

15:59.360 --> 16:03.524
Well, good news.
I got them to cut it down to 12 and 11.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.840
A positive step,
but we need to cut a little deeper.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.004
Okay, well, what's the max amount of people
we can afford to hire for them?

16:12.080 --> 16:13.081
Three for each of them.

16:13.200 --> 16:14.725
Three? Are you serious?

16:15.880 --> 16:17.166
Can you just tell them?

16:17.240 --> 16:18.401
Oh, I have, several times.

16:18.480 --> 16:22.963
But they just kept saying if I didn't waste
so much money at the butthole doctor,

16:23.040 --> 16:24.166
then we'd have enough money,

16:24.240 --> 16:27.050
but I pay for all my medical out of pocket.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.370
We can only afford to hire
three people for each of you.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.965
I'm sorry, but that's it.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.566
- Okay, that's fine.
- It works for me.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.166
What?

16:36.240 --> 16:39.289
If you could do it with three people,
why didn't you just say so?

16:39.360 --> 16:41.806
Because we're negotiating
against each other.

16:41.880 --> 16:45.965
No, we're not. We're on the same team.
We want the same thing.

16:46.040 --> 16:50.762
Disagree. I just got you to give me three
guys for a job I could easily do with two.

16:50.840 --> 16:52.285
God damn it.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.445
Knock, knock, who's there? This guy.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.521
Hey, Russ, what's up?

16:56.600 --> 16:59.331
- How are you?
- I'm good. What brings you here?

16:59.400 --> 17:01.880
I had to meet this lawyer
and his fucking kid's sick,

17:01.960 --> 17:03.246
so now I have a few hours to kill.

17:03.320 --> 17:09.167
Did I see a McLaren 650 S with the
extra-trim package pull into the driveway?

17:09.240 --> 17:11.481
- Or did I not?
- Yep.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.040
So this is the team.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.205
Whoa...

17:16.280 --> 17:19.284
I'm just gonna say it.
This guy fucks. Am I right?

17:19.359 --> 17:21.010
'Cause I'm looking at the rest of you guys,

17:21.079 --> 17:22.730
and this is the guy in the house
doing all the fucking.

17:22.800 --> 17:23.800
Am I right? You know I'm right.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.042
This guy fucks.

17:27.119 --> 17:28.201
Thank you.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.486
Hey, what's up, Al-Qaeda?

17:30.480 --> 17:32.801
No, I'm totally kidding.
I'm diffusing the tension with humor.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.689
What tension? There's tension?

17:34.760 --> 17:36.683
No, of course not. Seriously, no
beheadings, though, all right?

17:36.760 --> 17:38.808
Russ Hanneman.
How you doing, motherfucker?

17:39.480 --> 17:41.209
Oh, man.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.090
I want to know what kind
of fucked-up childhood this guy had.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.724
All right, fellas, what are we doing here?

17:52.840 --> 17:58.768
Mr. Hanneman, I am Erlich Bachman. I am
the owner and proprietor of this house.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.763
So I can give you
a tour of the premises if you like,

18:00.840 --> 18:03.571
show you where the actual fucking happens.

18:03.640 --> 18:04.766
Nah, I'm good.

18:04.840 --> 18:08.765
Listen, I don't want to disturb the flow. I
just wanted to check out the magic in action.

18:08.840 --> 18:09.921
So I'm gonna grab a seat right over there.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.241
I'm gonna be a fly on the wall.
I'm not gonna say a word. Shh.

18:12.360 --> 18:16.160
We have a meeting that we were going to do,
so maybe we could just do that?

18:16.280 --> 18:19.682
It was nice to meet you, Russ.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.444
So, uh, I think we'd
actually save a lot of time

18:21.520 --> 18:25.127
if we got on the same page
in regards to the budget.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.089
So what I need from you guys is to...

18:27.160 --> 18:29.242
I'm sorry, do you really talk like that?

18:30.360 --> 18:32.124
- Like what?
- Like that.

18:32.200 --> 18:35.522
I mean, this is...
This is my normal speaking voice.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.728
Like right now, like how you're talking,
is that real?

18:37.800 --> 18:39.609
This one? This is real.

18:39.720 --> 18:40.721
Wow!

18:41.640 --> 18:43.244
All right, yeah. Doesn't matter, go, go.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.766
This is the same way
as I was talking back there.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.649
- Keep going.
- At the door. Okay.

18:49.240 --> 18:53.165
Okay, so I think, actually,
if we went back closer to...

18:53.240 --> 18:55.322
C Dog! You, homo.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.448
- ...our requests with an eye...
- Nothing.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.965
No, you should come here.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.321
- Keep going, keep going.
- Okay.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.244
- ...that's more in line with...
- What's the address here again?

19:06.240 --> 19:07.401
I would just clear it with Erlich...

19:07.480 --> 19:08.481
Hang on.

19:09.200 --> 19:12.249
It's 5230 Newell Road.

19:13.440 --> 19:15.249
Did you get that? Keep going, keep going.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.243
- Okay, back to it.
- Get a fucking pen.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.810
Go again. Say it one more time.

19:18.880 --> 19:20.006
The address is...

19:20.080 --> 19:23.209
- Go for it.
- It's 5230 Newell Road.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.165
Keep going. Did you get that?

19:25.240 --> 19:27.971
I don't know. He's a fucker.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.650
That little Hendricks prick
fucked me over, again.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.644
I want this suit to be more
than a holding action. I want to win it.

19:34.720 --> 19:35.881
What can we do here?

19:35.960 --> 19:40.887
Well, this lawsuit is going to be
a protracted and time-consuming ordeal.

19:40.960 --> 19:44.043
But with our superior resources,
top litigators,

19:44.160 --> 19:46.686
we feel this gives us the advantage
over Pied Piper.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.649
Translation?

19:48.720 --> 19:54.170
Ultimately, the suit will turn based on proving
that Pied Piper was created here at Hooli.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.210
Now so far, concrete
evidence of that is thin.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.566
So thicken it!

20:00.120 --> 20:02.691
Gavin, your visitors are here.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.287
Ah! Gentlemen! And lady.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.082
Thank you for coming today
to open a dialogue.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.366
Now if you'll follow me.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.887
In an effort to hardwire sensitivity
into our corporate mind-space,

20:13.960 --> 20:18.090
I'm having a scale replica
of the Hall of Names at Yad Vashem

20:18.160 --> 20:20.049
constructed right next to the bike shop.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.810
Okay, so...

20:23.880 --> 20:27.362
No, no, no!
It's got to be afternoon. Afternoon.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.568
No, no. Bring him, too.
Which Raoul? Lawyer Raoul?

20:29.640 --> 20:32.405
Litigation and payroll
are both capped.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.608
SG&A, we still have a little wiggle room.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.564
And we're going to punt...

20:37.120 --> 20:38.121
No, fuckhead!

20:38.360 --> 20:40.931
Sir, you know you can
turn the volume down on that.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.923
Just on the side.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.764
Where does that leave us?

20:44.840 --> 20:46.205
Let's go open an IPA, huh?

20:46.280 --> 20:49.045
I'm sorry, what? I couldn't hear you.
Someone was talking. What did you say?

20:49.800 --> 20:51.131
Keep going, keep going.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.362
- Right.
- Richard, one potential issue.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.086
Our hosting fees could become
a challenge as we scale.

20:56.160 --> 20:59.528
Right, but we can offset a lot of that
once we get a few customers

20:59.600 --> 21:01.284
and start a subscription-revenue model.

21:01.360 --> 21:04.762
What? Revenue? No, no, no.
No revenue. I'll call you back.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.285
What?

21:06.360 --> 21:07.930
Why would you go after revenue?

21:08.480 --> 21:11.131
Because to make money.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.929
No.

21:13.040 --> 21:16.362
If you show revenue, people will ask,
"How much?" And it will never be enough.

21:16.440 --> 21:20.206
The company that was the 100xer,
the 1,000xer, becomes the 2x dog.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.648
But if you have no revenue,
you can say you're pre-revenue.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.569
You're a potential pure play.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.923
It's not about how much you earn,
it's about what you're worth.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.650
And who's worth the most?

21:30.720 --> 21:32.051
Companies that lose money.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.963
Pinterest, Snapchat, no revenue.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.805
Amazon has lost money every fucking quarter
for the last 20 fucking years

21:36.880 --> 21:38.245
and that Bezos motherfucker is the king.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.287
The king.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.971
There's no revenue.
No one wants to see revenue. Go.

21:44.240 --> 21:48.245
I just thought that mainly
the goal of companies is to make money.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.209
Yeah, no, no, no. That's not how it works.

21:50.280 --> 21:52.282
I don't want to make
a little bit of money every day.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.601
I want to make a fuckton
of money all at once. ROI.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.686
ROI. You know what that stands for?

22:00.160 --> 22:02.003
- Uh, return on...
- Return on investment!

22:02.080 --> 22:03.923
No.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.163
- Radio on Internet.
- Internet.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.401
Did you put radio on the Internet?

22:09.080 --> 22:11.082
- No.
- So everything you just did, do the opposite.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.605
So you want us to take files
and make them bigger?

22:17.880 --> 22:19.245
That guy!

22:19.320 --> 22:21.288
That guy is crazy. I love that guy.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.688
You said that you were going to be
hands-off. Is that still happening?

22:24.760 --> 22:25.921
Yes, please.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.731
Do me a favor, make the right fucking
decisions and leave me the fuck out.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.770
You think Corey wants to be here?
Corey, let's bounce. Come on.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.923
- Uh, Richard? The check.
- Right.

22:35.040 --> 22:39.090
Mr. Hanneman, I think
the bank had some issue with the check.

22:39.160 --> 22:41.606
They said the funds are on hold
for some reason?

22:41.680 --> 22:44.445
Wait, you didn't try to cash that check,
did you?

22:44.520 --> 22:46.249
Did you try to cash that check I gave you?

22:46.320 --> 22:49.130
That's the show check. That's the one
you frame and put up on your wall.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.884
You didn't try to cash that, did you?

22:52.320 --> 22:55.130
So do we arrange a wire transfer or...

22:55.200 --> 22:57.362
No. No, you don't get it all at once.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.960
We set your burn rate and then
I cut you a new check every other week

23:00.040 --> 23:02.771
between now and CES in January,
unless you fuck up too badly.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.047
All right, hit it hard, boys.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.845
This guy fucks.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.362
You know, Russ,
I've been known to fuck myself.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.120
Well, he's the worst man in America.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.770
And now he owns us.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.002
Why the fuck would he have us
come all the way out here?

23:32.080 --> 23:33.491
I don't know.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.811
Boys.

23:37.880 --> 23:38.881
Russ, what's up? Um...

23:40.080 --> 23:44.005
I know you had asked us to concentrate more
on branding and less about the product,

23:44.080 --> 23:45.605
but we were thinking about that and...

23:45.680 --> 23:46.920
I got it.

23:51.000 --> 23:51.967
God?

23:52.040 --> 23:54.202
No. No, shitheads. Look!

23:55.400 --> 23:57.004
Oh.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.407
"I am Pied Piper"?

23:59.480 --> 24:00.481
Who is that?

24:01.200 --> 24:03.123
Yeah, how is she Pied Piper?

24:03.200 --> 24:05.521
- What is this?
- Brand awareness.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.364
We're getting Pied Piper out there.

24:07.440 --> 24:08.646
Right.

24:09.200 --> 24:13.364
But what exactly is the product?
I mean, what's... What's this selling?

24:13.440 --> 24:15.204
Pied Piper, idiot.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.362
- I like it.
- Uh-huh.

24:17.440 --> 24:21.809
Yeah, here's the new check I promised you.
This one you can cash.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.804
Obviously, I had to subtract the cost
of the ad agency that nailed that slogan.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.486
The photo, legal, lay-out,
plus the cost of the 15 billboards.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.324
Don't worry,
I gave you guys a sweet deal on them.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.845
- Gave us?
- Yeah.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.321
Hanneman Outdoor Media.
I own the billboards.

24:33.400 --> 24:36.609
That's how I talked the ad agency into giving
you guys that slogan for only 30 grand.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.842
Synergy, bitches. Know what that means?

24:38.920 --> 24:42.686
Does it mean taking a stack of cash
and lighting it on fire?

24:46.240 --> 24:47.730
Crazy fuck! I love this guy.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.006
You fucking guy! Oh, and get this.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.844
I found out where Gavin Belson lives

24:52.920 --> 24:56.925
and I placed 15 of these babies
between his house and his office.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.243
And guess where I placed
the biggest one of all?

25:00.880 --> 25:03.167
This is the most
hostile and aggressive act

25:03.240 --> 25:05.891
of provocation I've ever had to endure.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.807
It crosses every line of decency.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.160
This is war.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.004
You better have something good for me.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.970
We believe we have a way to win this case.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.442
What if there were an
individual here at Hooli

25:22.480 --> 25:25.404
with whom Hendricks
had had a lot of contact?

25:25.480 --> 25:30.361
What if this individual were, arguably,
a member of the original Pied Piper team?

25:32.920 --> 25:34.763
What if we took steps

25:34.840 --> 25:40.244
to present this individual in a light
such that his talents were undeniable?

25:44.280 --> 25:46.601
Surely an individual this brilliant

25:46.680 --> 25:49.684
would move quickly up the ladder
here at Hooli.

25:49.760 --> 25:53.481
Surely he'd be promoted rapidly
and repeatedly, no?

25:54.560 --> 25:58.645
And surely these impressive promotions
would lead a court to agree

25:58.720 --> 26:03.089
that someone this brilliant, who was
there at the inception of Pied Piper,

26:03.160 --> 26:07.131
must be integral to,
if not solely responsible for its creation.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.611
It's all right. You can come in.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.047
Hmm.

26:12.120 --> 26:16.170
So you're saying the more praise
and promotion we heap on this person,

26:16.240 --> 26:20.165
the more it looks
like Pied Piper was created here at Hooli.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.761
Big Head!

26:29.840 --> 26:32.127
Sorry. Sorry, guys. Hooli phone?

26:32.200 --> 26:34.043
I didn't even know the ringer was on.

26:34.480 --> 26:36.289
No one's ever actually called it before.

26:37.520 --> 26:38.681
Hello?

26:43.400 --> 26:45.243
Nothing. Why?
