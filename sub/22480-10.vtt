00:00.612 --> 00:02.474
I have orders from Donovan.

00:03.140 --> 00:04.501
- Jensen!
- I have him.

00:04.568 --> 00:06.842
Donovan lied to us.
Lowry was a British agent.

00:06.878 --> 00:09.205
Donovan trained him. For Project Tenebrae.

00:09.241 --> 00:10.129
Tangoes incoming.

00:14.169 --> 00:18.220
How much do you think the Americans would
pay to keep this whole shit show quiet?

00:18.256 --> 00:20.372
I have something better... the Atlas,

00:20.408 --> 00:24.560
a list of every covert op and agent
sanctioned by British military.

00:26.331 --> 00:27.274
"Jawedan, listen.

00:27.310 --> 00:31.235
We should be together walking
through the fields of Camomile."

00:31.350 --> 00:35.063
All I want is the location of the Atlas.

00:35.121 --> 00:36.731
It's on Avet Island.

00:40.203 --> 00:41.938
You're not taking me in, are you?

01:01.588 --> 01:02.318
Go!

01:04.422 --> 01:05.641
Wait, wait. Left.

01:10.436 --> 01:11.369
Coming through!

01:11.610 --> 01:12.438
Thanks.

01:12.765 --> 01:15.067
- This way!
- Move! Go! Go!

01:16.372 --> 01:19.157
- Shit.
- Ah, no, no!

01:21.446 --> 01:22.302
Boat?

01:23.611 --> 01:24.852
Yeah. Come on, let's do it!

01:25.735 --> 01:26.579
Ready?

01:41.702 --> 01:42.865
Come on!

01:47.165 --> 01:50.238
- Shit! Ah, shit! Grenade!
- Shit.

01:51.869 --> 01:52.748
Go!

02:02.382 --> 02:03.472
Yeah!

02:04.780 --> 02:06.539
Now we just have to find Ives.

02:25.006 --> 02:27.259
You can stop the dirty looks, yeah?

02:27.332 --> 02:30.153
Right now, this Atlas of intelligence
is the only thing stopping me

02:30.223 --> 02:33.475
from selling your ass on the open market!

02:45.743 --> 02:47.175
I brought the Camomile.

02:50.615 --> 02:51.828
British intel.

02:52.707 --> 02:54.279
It's on Avet Island.

02:56.511 --> 02:59.803
Shall I stop with the
dirty looks now, Mr Ives?

03:02.491 --> 03:04.439
Comrade.

03:12.185 --> 03:15.178
Hey! Up ahead, that's Ives' boat!

03:16.012 --> 03:17.132
Get after them!

03:21.717 --> 03:24.164
- We've got company!
- What the fuck...?

03:25.469 --> 03:26.671
Who the hell are they?

03:35.230 --> 03:36.269
Agh!

03:38.988 --> 03:41.238
Did you hear that? Russian!

03:51.687 --> 03:52.937
Shit, we've been hit!

03:53.775 --> 03:54.740
Shit!

03:57.516 --> 03:59.023
They're going up the right!

04:01.720 --> 04:03.566
It's OK, it's just a little smoke.

04:08.531 --> 04:09.624
It'll hold.

04:45.406 --> 04:46.978
Subtitles by explosiveskull

05:18.132 --> 05:19.830
Michael, stop fucking around.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.480
So, are you cowboys gonna
tell me who the hell you are?

05:30.613 --> 05:33.380
We're on the trail of the Atlas.
Stolen British military files.

05:33.443 --> 05:36.753
Oh, yeah? Never heard of that one before.
But you know, when I lose something,

05:36.789 --> 05:39.356
- it's usually in the last place I look.
- That's cute.

05:44.054 --> 05:49.855
We know Lowry had it and now
Idrisi's after it, isn't he?

05:49.948 --> 05:51.700
D'you wanna back it off there, mate?

05:51.815 --> 05:52.934
You heard her.

05:54.529 --> 05:55.850
Step back.

05:57.101 --> 06:00.124
Ah, fuck, it's you two.

06:00.502 --> 06:03.079
Looks like I know them.
These guys used to be 20.

06:04.042 --> 06:05.483
Seriously,

06:06.395 --> 06:08.983
you're in bed with the Russians?

06:09.743 --> 06:10.943
Jane, uh...

06:12.960 --> 06:15.392
...I heard her contact him.

06:15.509 --> 06:18.962
It turns out they were
interested in the Atlas, as well.

06:19.063 --> 06:20.699
Whatever they were offering,

06:20.820 --> 06:22.071
I'll pay double.

06:25.566 --> 06:27.941
It's not about the money, Mr Ives.

06:29.202 --> 06:31.906
But in Libya, you told 20 where I was.

06:32.503 --> 06:35.182
That led to Jane and I being separated,

06:35.276 --> 06:38.659
to my capture and to her death.

06:39.102 --> 06:41.055
Everything that has happened

06:42.532 --> 06:44.099
is because of you.

06:44.227 --> 06:48.492
We should head to the island soon.
Take vehicles. Go via the causeway.

06:48.528 --> 06:50.229
I don't care how we get there.

06:50.299 --> 06:53.509
I just meant, if you wanted,

06:53.588 --> 06:56.416
you still have time to do
whatever you need to do.

07:00.867 --> 07:04.843
This whole situation
reminds me of a fucking joke!

07:04.913 --> 07:08.036
See, there's a Muscovite
businessman, a Siberian

07:08.083 --> 07:10.775
farmer and a policeman from St Petersburg

07:10.830 --> 07:12.522
all standing on top of this building.

07:12.585 --> 07:15.852
The stock market has
crashed, the ruble's flatlined

07:15.923 --> 07:19.082
they've lost all their savings,
they're on the food line.

07:19.168 --> 07:21.215
A normal day in Russia, right?

07:24.956 --> 07:26.548
They decide to end it all,

07:26.594 --> 07:30.088
make a pact to jump off the
building at the same time.

07:31.002 --> 07:33.856
But who hits the ground first,

07:33.965 --> 07:35.122
the businessman,

07:35.994 --> 07:37.078
the farmer?

07:38.135 --> 07:40.154
Anybody want to guess?

07:41.626 --> 07:42.455
No?

07:45.115 --> 07:46.502
The Russian,

07:47.200 --> 07:49.179
so who gives a fuck?

07:56.919 --> 07:58.689
I'll give you plenty instead.

07:59.204 --> 08:02.010
Katya, set a course to Avet Island.

08:06.212 --> 08:07.699
These people who are after you,

08:07.787 --> 08:10.668
they're military. They're Stillwater.
Contractors sent to clean house.

08:10.739 --> 08:12.244
A bunch of assholes.

08:12.322 --> 08:14.876
So I'm guessing you must've done
something to piss off the wrong people.

08:14.939 --> 08:18.555
Yeah, our CO, trying to cover
up mistakes from the past.

08:18.610 --> 08:21.314
Just out of curiosity, who
are you guys working for, hm?

08:21.350 --> 08:23.105
- It's a little complicated.
- Is it?

08:25.182 --> 08:26.684
You were disavowed by the British military

08:26.746 --> 08:29.786
and now you've drafted in on
occasion to do high-risk covert ops.

08:29.822 --> 08:30.648
How many are there?

08:30.739 --> 08:31.829
Fuck me.

08:32.339 --> 08:33.260
Well...

08:33.604 --> 08:36.441
- at least it's not that complicated!
- It's not, is it, sunshine?

08:36.881 --> 08:39.414
We've been on the trail of the stolen
intel for the last few months now.

08:39.498 --> 08:40.498
Is that right?

08:41.934 --> 08:44.795
It's just, uh, we've
been looking for it for

08:44.849 --> 08:47.380
the last day and we're already ahead of ya!

08:47.419 --> 08:50.659
- We got a little distracted in SÃ£o Paulo.
- Which we agreed we wouldn't talk about.

08:50.714 --> 08:52.702
- No, we agreed you wouldn't talk about it.
- Damien!

08:52.765 --> 08:54.570
Michael. Shut up.

08:54.625 --> 08:55.979
Yeah. Fuck you, mate.

08:56.698 --> 08:59.684
Jesus Christ! Pair of idiots.

09:12.767 --> 09:13.781
Shit!

09:14.487 --> 09:16.203
Wyatt? Are you OK?

09:16.299 --> 09:19.197
Well, that kinda depends
on your definition of OK.

09:19.662 --> 09:22.123
We took out Lowry, but we lost Idrisi.

09:22.463 --> 09:25.139
We did, however, get a
location on the Atlas.

09:25.249 --> 09:29.208
A place called Avet Island, due
south of the Bosnian-Croatian border.

09:29.278 --> 09:32.380
OK. We're closer. We'll make a move for it.

09:32.434 --> 09:34.215
Yeah, well, it'll have to be a quick move.

09:34.299 --> 09:37.020
Ives, Idrisi and the Russian
Special Ops are already on their way.

09:37.083 --> 09:37.807
Russian?

09:37.870 --> 09:40.424
"Yeah, Turns out there's a
party and everyone's invited."

09:41.155 --> 09:43.319
Right. Well, we'll hold
them off as long as we can.

09:43.397 --> 09:45.368
All right. And Cap...

09:46.578 --> 09:47.540
...Donovan?

09:49.357 --> 09:52.120
- We're on our own now.
- "Copy that."

09:52.629 --> 09:56.140
- "Have you got transport?"
- She's asking if we have transport.

09:57.737 --> 09:58.974
I think we'll manage.

10:01.117 --> 10:03.162
- They've got a fix on the intel.
- Sweet.

10:03.241 --> 10:04.113
Moving.

10:07.792 --> 10:08.546
Clear.

10:11.338 --> 10:12.225
Clear.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.474
Stillwater assholes inbound.

10:15.841 --> 10:18.631
Are you sure you can get to the
Atlas before anyone else does?

10:19.685 --> 10:21.885
We have to. We need it to get back in.

10:23.959 --> 10:26.244
- We need it to stay alive.
- It's always hearts and flowers

10:26.314 --> 10:28.459
until they try to blow your brains out.

10:31.943 --> 10:34.059
We'll hold off Stillwater,
buy you some time.

10:34.417 --> 10:35.578
You stay in touch.

10:36.820 --> 10:37.832
Thanks.

10:37.910 --> 10:39.766
We'll rendezvous once
you've got the package.

10:40.300 --> 10:41.090
Appreciate it.

10:41.126 --> 10:42.932
Yeah, well, that's the kind
of gentlemen that we are.

10:42.968 --> 10:44.664
- Go on. Go.
- Moving.

10:46.816 --> 10:49.329
Speaking of which, we
are the kinda gentlemen

10:49.384 --> 10:51.699
that will steal that
intel from them, right?

10:51.777 --> 10:53.696
Stealing is such a harsh word. Let's go.

10:53.759 --> 10:54.525
Yeah.

10:55.097 --> 10:56.431
Let's move, bud.

11:06.651 --> 11:09.681
"It's a complicated situation."

11:09.744 --> 11:12.535
What's complicated?! You
ordered Donovan to eliminate us!

11:12.611 --> 11:14.852
"Whatever Donovan did, she did alone."

11:14.907 --> 11:17.130
I'm sure you've got a wall of deniability!

11:17.200 --> 11:20.514
But we've got bigger problems
here. Lowry stole the fucking Atlas!

11:21.117 --> 11:23.325
We were aware there might've been a breach.

11:23.431 --> 11:24.887
"Well, Idrisi's after it."

11:24.973 --> 11:28.882
Idrisi alongside some Russian
Special Forces. My guess would be GRU.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.786
It's the entire map of
the British military covert

11:31.846 --> 11:34.657
operation. If it falls
into Russian hands...

11:36.586 --> 11:38.838
Tell me your location, I'll send a squad.

11:39.338 --> 11:42.475
Yeah, I don't think so! We'll get
the Atlas and we'll bring it in.

11:42.556 --> 11:43.797
And then what?

11:44.274 --> 11:47.431
And then the operation
will be deemed a success...

11:47.497 --> 11:52.101
Lowry terminated, Atlas secured
and 20 back where they belong.

11:52.196 --> 11:53.638
Yeah. Thought so.

11:54.268 --> 11:58.295
Just remember, Captain, if
you come home empty-handed,

11:58.405 --> 12:02.243
you're nothing but the team
that eliminated their own CO,

12:02.858 --> 12:05.782
and that story does
not have a happy ending.

12:05.818 --> 12:06.820
Copy.

12:11.406 --> 12:12.553
Are we screwed?

12:13.445 --> 12:15.353
Yeah. If we don't get the Atlas.

12:15.389 --> 12:17.048
Maybe we were screwed from the start.

12:17.574 --> 12:19.709
Donovan only got us in
to clean up the mess.

12:21.414 --> 12:23.410
You know, I didn't even
try to bring her in alive.

12:23.446 --> 12:24.947
You ask me, Captain,

12:25.025 --> 12:26.212
you did the right thing.

12:29.045 --> 12:29.994
Incoming.

12:30.284 --> 12:32.535
- They're keen. We set?
- Yep.

12:33.782 --> 12:36.407
Everyone's after this damn thing.
It better be bloody worth it!

13:14.198 --> 13:15.064
OK.

13:23.156 --> 13:24.595
That should buy us some time.

13:32.909 --> 13:34.331
20 are here.

13:35.972 --> 13:37.820
We are going to need more men.

13:44.373 --> 13:46.122
Let's move. Now.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.062
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.753
We need to get out to that
island, quick as we can.

14:08.789 --> 14:10.116
'Cause the Russians are gonna be on us.

14:10.202 --> 14:13.207
I just gotta check. Everybody is
cool to go back for this, right?

14:13.271 --> 14:14.359
Well, what's the other option?

14:14.395 --> 14:16.937
If they get their hands on it,
military intelligence is crippled...

14:16.999 --> 14:19.500
soldiers, ops, everything we've worked for.

14:19.586 --> 14:23.797
A bad boss doesn't mean a bad
job. Will said it was worth it.

14:24.245 --> 14:27.551
I believed him back then
and I believe him now.

14:27.629 --> 14:28.906
Come on, it could be worse.

14:28.970 --> 14:30.020
It could be raining.

14:43.554 --> 14:45.190
That looks like a mausoleum to me.

14:45.929 --> 14:46.875
Moving.

15:12.481 --> 15:15.056
All right, short stuff, come
on, you and me, let's go!

15:15.092 --> 15:18.050
Short stuff, eh? That
really isn't a fucking thing!

15:19.935 --> 15:21.102
See you, Big Mac!

15:22.269 --> 15:23.215
Moving.

15:24.093 --> 15:26.036
We need to find an over-watch position.

15:36.427 --> 15:37.403
Shit.

16:08.429 --> 16:11.779
That's got to be where Lowry
headed, centre of the mausoleum.

16:12.093 --> 16:15.611
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.
I don't even know what it looks like.

16:20.401 --> 16:21.346
It's clear.

16:25.812 --> 16:28.611
- All right. Where do you want to start?
- Yeah.

16:29.253 --> 16:30.553
Top right.

16:31.590 --> 16:32.680
Oh, fuck!

16:52.957 --> 16:56.711
You know, if Lowry had this
intel, how come she never used it?

16:57.545 --> 16:59.253
Maybe she didn't have a chance.

16:59.372 --> 17:02.207
Maybe she didn't want
Idrisi to find out the truth.

17:02.375 --> 17:06.419
Or maybe if you didn't
keep asking questions,

17:06.635 --> 17:08.560
we'd find the fucking thing faster!

17:10.871 --> 17:12.325
It was a rhetorical question.

17:33.317 --> 17:34.372
We've got to move.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.172
You go, I'll keep them away!

17:51.587 --> 17:52.987
Go, go, go, go!

17:57.121 --> 17:59.768
Shit! They've circled around us. Move it!

18:07.735 --> 18:08.721
Shh. Get down.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.059
The fuck...

18:37.899 --> 18:39.862
- See if you can get round the other side.
- Copy that.

18:39.898 --> 18:41.899
Hey, wait. Wait for my signal.

18:42.027 --> 18:44.536
- What's your signal?
- You'll see.

19:18.898 --> 19:20.317
You took her from me!

19:20.856 --> 19:22.045
You people,

19:22.749 --> 19:24.894
you have no idea what you've taken!

19:25.519 --> 19:28.230
My family! My wife!

19:57.800 --> 19:58.867
Move!

20:41.290 --> 20:43.665
- Bullshit!
- Ah, it was worth a try!

20:43.701 --> 20:44.413
Hey!

20:45.877 --> 20:46.896
Fuck!

20:54.006 --> 20:55.563
I never wanted this.

20:55.633 --> 20:56.979
I had my team,

20:57.218 --> 20:59.259
my squad, my brothers.

20:59.361 --> 21:00.895
You took that from me!

21:00.942 --> 21:03.412
Do you even think about
the people you have killed?

21:04.813 --> 21:05.788
Agh!

21:08.778 --> 21:10.637
You're not changing the world!

21:17.099 --> 21:19.095
You're just putting fucking holes in it!

21:22.419 --> 21:24.896
So, what are you saying, Thomas?

21:28.075 --> 21:31.105
Should we put down our weapons,

21:31.866 --> 21:34.260
talk about our differences?

21:34.357 --> 21:35.004
No.

21:37.370 --> 21:38.795
I'm saying today,

21:39.468 --> 21:41.136
today's the day you die.

22:04.943 --> 22:07.488
Package acquired. Move out.

22:07.589 --> 22:09.752
- I'm not done!
- Katya, now!

22:16.723 --> 22:17.613
Captain.

22:18.688 --> 22:20.099
Are you all right?

22:20.221 --> 22:22.245
The Russians have the Atlas.

22:37.688 --> 22:39.219
I just killed Omair Idrisi.

22:40.101 --> 22:41.324
Are you sure?

22:41.424 --> 22:42.390
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.059
The Atlas?

22:48.168 --> 22:51.745
The Russians have it.
They've already moved out.

22:51.792 --> 22:54.302
What was the point? It
was all for shit, mate.

22:57.505 --> 22:58.839
At least the rain's stopped.

23:10.244 --> 23:11.699
Michael,

23:11.883 --> 23:13.428
we could do with your help.

23:23.411 --> 23:27.390
- What is this place?
- It's an old KGB safe house.

23:27.490 --> 23:31.367
Mind you, the owner can be a bit,
er, temperamental. Welcome home.

23:40.390 --> 23:41.759
What the hell...?!

23:46.503 --> 23:48.093
- Michael!
- Peter.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.304
- Where is the other?
- He's late.

23:53.297 --> 23:54.624
Typical.

23:54.777 --> 23:59.241
We were in the area and needed
a drink. Maybe something more...

24:00.052 --> 24:02.422
Make yourselves comfortable.

24:03.906 --> 24:05.796
Right, first things first...

24:29.798 --> 24:31.584
Lance Corporal William Jensen.

24:31.948 --> 24:34.745
- To Jensen.
- Jensen.

24:44.384 --> 24:46.784
- Johnson.
- Johnson.

25:17.973 --> 25:18.809
Hey...

25:20.799 --> 25:22.375
- That's him, right?
- Yep.

25:23.773 --> 25:27.661
Anton Krupin and Katya Korikova.

25:28.562 --> 25:32.108
GRU Black Ops. More competent and
ruthless than the KGB ever was.

25:32.233 --> 25:34.840
Covert ops, meddling in
foreign elections, not

25:34.895 --> 25:37.139
to mention their weapon
caches in the US, just in case.

25:37.209 --> 25:38.621
Once they've decrypted the Atlas, they'll

25:38.657 --> 25:42.293
have every British military
secret, as well. Bloody brilliant!

25:42.355 --> 25:45.519
So we've got about, what, 12
hours until everything's fucked.

25:45.555 --> 25:47.846
Until we're disavowed and hunted down.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.864
Contracts on your pretty little heads

25:50.567 --> 25:52.624
and everyone's looking to collect.

25:53.383 --> 25:54.855
Hard to resist.

25:57.926 --> 25:59.397
You are fucking with us, right?

26:02.276 --> 26:04.092
- I'm fucking with you.
- Dick head.

26:04.174 --> 26:07.263
Listen. The fact remains the same,
without the Atlas, you're screwed.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.521
So we get it back.

26:08.592 --> 26:10.904
Except we don't know
where the GRU have taken it

26:10.940 --> 26:13.104
and we don't have time to track them down.

26:13.167 --> 26:14.965
So, why don't we steal something off them?

26:15.557 --> 26:17.150
Something of equal worth.

26:17.723 --> 26:18.920
Force a trade.

26:20.673 --> 26:23.063
Oh, come on, reality check! We cannot just

26:23.099 --> 26:26.077
storm in and steal a list of GRU Black Ops.

26:31.225 --> 26:32.768
Oh, that's what we're doing?

26:33.819 --> 26:35.055
'Course we fucking are.

26:36.500 --> 26:40.693
So Victor says PanÄevo,
Serbia, nearest Russian databank.

26:40.755 --> 26:43.478
- What's the security like?
- It's pretty brutal.

26:43.549 --> 26:47.120
What have we got? Lockdown
protocols, reinforced

26:47.190 --> 26:50.661
steel doors, self-destruct
mechanisms. Nice.

26:50.716 --> 26:52.475
So even if we do break in and grab the GRU

26:52.511 --> 26:54.392
data, there's no guarantee
we'll make it out.

26:55.298 --> 26:57.117
What if you knocked out
the nearest power grid?

26:58.717 --> 27:01.175
Auxiliary power should go to
protecting the server. That should,

27:01.211 --> 27:04.377
theoretically, get you a window before
any security shutdown goes into effect.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.636
How big a window?

27:05.672 --> 27:07.920
How long's a piece of string?
I don't know. Seven minutes?

27:07.956 --> 27:08.943
Well, you know what they say.

27:08.979 --> 27:12.102
It's not the size of the window
that matters, it's how you use it.

27:12.204 --> 27:14.566
Sure, knock out the power,
break into the building,

27:14.637 --> 27:18.930
locate the secure GRU servers
and steal the sensitive data

27:19.014 --> 27:22.138
all in the same amount of time it
takes to make a good cup of coffee.

27:22.369 --> 27:25.778
But hey, what's the alternative, spend
the rest of our lives on the run, right?

27:25.856 --> 27:26.705
Kinda like this guy.

27:26.775 --> 27:29.236
It's a big ask. You're
gonna need all hands on deck.

27:29.301 --> 27:31.104
That's why you're gonna take
out the power grid for us.

27:31.140 --> 27:32.584
No. No, I'm not.

27:32.676 --> 27:34.892
Come on, mate! Throw us a bone!

27:34.959 --> 27:36.736
Do it for 20, one last time!

27:40.180 --> 27:42.127
Whoa! Whoa! Put 'em down.

27:44.590 --> 27:46.974
- What did I miss, Mikey? Fuck's going on?
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:47.021 --> 27:50.544
It's about time. Come here.
Come on. Change of plans.

27:50.661 --> 27:52.903
- So... tell me about it over a beer.
- No.

27:52.940 --> 27:55.515
- Come on! Come on!
- What...? Fuck you, I'm thirsty!

27:55.580 --> 27:57.088
Shut up, Scott. Let's go.

28:37.151 --> 28:39.336
All right, Michael, ETA on lights out.

28:41.185 --> 28:42.146
Is that working?

28:44.780 --> 28:46.495
- Nothing.
- "Bollocks."

28:46.549 --> 28:49.209
- It's not working! It's not working!
- Huh?

28:49.425 --> 28:50.323
Anything?

28:52.430 --> 28:53.898
No. Nothing.

28:55.109 --> 28:57.887
Scott! Scott! It's not gonna
work! It's not gonna work, mate.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.544
Well, you know what I've always said,

29:02.718 --> 29:06.080
if you can't smash the fuck out of
it, you shoot the fuck out of it.

29:11.456 --> 29:12.664
What about now?

29:13.484 --> 29:14.717
That should do it.

29:15.599 --> 29:16.544
Hey, Scott,

29:17.269 --> 29:18.848
let's go to SÃ£o Paulo.

29:19.282 --> 29:20.229
Fuck, yeah!

29:23.206 --> 29:25.659
So seven minutes is all
we've got to work with, huh?

29:25.695 --> 29:27.064
That was the guess.

29:27.170 --> 29:28.957
"Could be more, could be less."

29:50.060 --> 29:50.933
Moving.

29:52.484 --> 29:53.449
Moving.

29:55.438 --> 29:56.490
Coming through.

29:56.887 --> 30:00.864
- Jesus, how much intel do they keep here?!
- All of it, by the looks of this.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.007
Our lot do the same.

30:47.123 --> 30:52.099
I have eyes on target. I
got one, two GRU guards.

30:52.193 --> 30:53.638
I'm gonna go up to the
control room, see if I

30:53.674 --> 30:56.624
can open that thing.
You're gonna need this.

30:56.972 --> 30:58.012
Gotcha.

30:59.094 --> 31:01.156
- Holler if you need me.
- Good luck.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.189
Let me know when you're set.

31:16.978 --> 31:18.712
- Set.
- Set.

31:32.615 --> 31:33.426
Moving!

32:12.499 --> 32:13.909
Well, so far, so good.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.500
Man, don't jinx it!

32:32.840 --> 32:35.104
Remember, if we can't secure the data...

32:35.140 --> 32:36.744
We destroy it, I know.

32:38.464 --> 32:40.189
Come on, you son of a bitch!

32:40.809 --> 32:41.918
Ahh!

32:42.985 --> 32:44.558
Cap, we're gonna need
your help with the door.

32:44.594 --> 32:46.510
Yeah. All right, Wyatt.
Just give me a minute!

33:00.676 --> 33:03.704
- Fucking Victor sold us out!
- It sure looks that way!

33:04.022 --> 33:05.366
We gotta get through!

33:05.404 --> 33:08.848
"Captain! Captain! We've got to
get this fucking door open now!"

33:12.580 --> 33:14.493
"Cap, we've got to move now! Now!"

33:16.615 --> 33:17.531
Bingo.

33:18.865 --> 33:20.732
Door's open! Go! Go! Go!

33:20.967 --> 33:22.411
Go! Move it!

33:25.577 --> 33:27.429
- Going in now!
- Yeah, go!

33:29.510 --> 33:31.306
- Which one is it?
- "Look for seven."

33:31.342 --> 33:32.299
Look for seven!

33:32.344 --> 33:34.171
Which one's seven, dammit?!

33:36.288 --> 33:37.359
On my way down.

33:42.499 --> 33:43.460
Agh!

33:53.465 --> 33:56.493
- We need to step it up!
- This one's seven!

33:57.060 --> 33:58.119
Are you sure?

33:58.940 --> 34:00.599
Yeah! But we've got to get it open!

34:04.723 --> 34:07.224
- Four minutes till lockdown!
- Can you stop that?

34:07.260 --> 34:08.784
Come on!

34:14.235 --> 34:17.507
- That didn't sound good.
- We just activated self-destruct mode.

34:17.554 --> 34:18.867
We got two minutes!

34:18.953 --> 34:20.899
Is there any chance you
mis-translated there?

34:20.960 --> 34:21.976
Nyet!

34:25.043 --> 34:25.963
Ugh!

34:32.168 --> 34:34.335
- How we doing?
- Just gimme a second!

34:44.389 --> 34:46.731
I did it! I did it.
The countdown's stopped!

34:46.801 --> 34:49.639
Now all we need to do is get that
thing and fight our way out of here!

34:57.295 --> 34:59.388
Stop dicking around and
get here and help me!

34:59.424 --> 35:00.748
I'm not. I don't think I can.

35:04.165 --> 35:05.379
Come here, have a look.

35:06.180 --> 35:07.624
- Fuck!
- What does that say?

35:08.256 --> 35:10.554
We need a passcode to
permanently disable it!

35:10.876 --> 35:11.928
Oh, fuck.

35:12.260 --> 35:14.464
Hang tight. Just hang tight. Uh...

35:14.500 --> 35:15.893
I think I've got an idea!

35:16.671 --> 35:19.992
- Coming through, Mac, cover my arse!
- I haven't got anything big enough, kid!

35:20.028 --> 35:21.591
Suck my dick!

35:31.580 --> 35:32.412
Ugh!

35:35.323 --> 35:39.152
Wait! Wait! Wait! Please! Please, you win.

35:39.222 --> 35:42.624
Please, I was just trying
to do my job, same as you!

35:48.780 --> 35:51.007
- Where the hell's Novin?
- Ah, fuck!

35:58.724 --> 36:01.787
- Fucking hell, kid!
- We're dragging this bastard outta here!

36:01.889 --> 36:03.250
Not exactly technical!

36:03.406 --> 36:07.485
- Fuck technical! How long we got, Wyatt?
- Yeah, one minute to security lockdown.

36:07.573 --> 36:09.235
When it comes to self-destruct,

36:09.271 --> 36:11.504
as long as my hand stays here,
you've got all the time you need.

36:12.059 --> 36:14.293
- No, no, no! We're not leaving you!
- We're going into lockdown.

36:14.329 --> 36:16.649
We gotta get this server outta here!
We're running out of fucking time!

36:16.696 --> 36:18.831
Well, she's sweet to go.

36:18.867 --> 36:20.478
The mission comes first.
You guys get out of

36:20.514 --> 36:22.984
here, you get home safe,
I'll make a run for it.

36:23.199 --> 36:25.549
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah, famous last words.

36:25.627 --> 36:27.873
Captain, we've got the server, we've
got wheels, we're coming through.

36:27.944 --> 36:29.779
"Copy that. I'm on my way to you."

36:30.942 --> 36:32.315
Catch you on the flipside.

36:32.362 --> 36:34.441
Jump on, Mac! We need to
get the fuck outta here!

36:34.500 --> 36:35.366
Let's go!

37:16.355 --> 37:18.703
"Wyatt, we're clear! Shutters are down!"

37:18.739 --> 37:22.384
Alright. Copy that. I'll find myself
a way out, don't worry about it.

37:22.725 --> 37:24.216
I've got 87 seconds.

38:09.180 --> 38:10.711
Wait! Wait!

38:10.766 --> 38:12.649
See this monitor?

38:12.756 --> 38:15.475
I take my hand off this and the
whole places goes up, all right?

38:15.538 --> 38:19.344
That's mutually-assured destruction!
That means you die and I die!

38:19.380 --> 38:23.135
- Or we work together?
- You're suggesting a truce?

38:23.171 --> 38:25.941
Yeah, I guess I am. Now what do you say?

38:27.569 --> 38:30.620
I am prepared to die
for my country. Are you?

38:34.788 --> 38:35.601
No.

38:39.182 --> 38:40.886
Oh, you son of a bitch!

38:44.698 --> 38:46.248
Fuck. Fuck!

38:46.311 --> 38:49.914
Mac, we've got a problem. We've
got a little situation in here.

38:49.950 --> 38:53.045
- What do you mean?
- The controller's broken.

38:53.081 --> 38:54.357
It's not stopping.

38:54.427 --> 38:55.244
Alright. We're going back in.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.956
No, no, no, no! There's no way in
and no way out. The shutters are down.

38:57.992 --> 38:59.409
- There's no time.
- Wyatt!

38:59.445 --> 39:01.184
Yeah, I just want you guys
to know something, all right?

39:02.332 --> 39:04.784
I thought I was done being
part of a team but, uh,

39:05.123 --> 39:06.420
it turns out I was wrong.

39:07.866 --> 39:09.231
You know, fucking maybe,

39:09.785 --> 39:12.181
maybe this was all for
something. You know, maybe it was.

39:12.217 --> 39:14.344
Hell, maybe we even made
the world a better place.

39:15.010 --> 39:16.127
"That's all right."

39:16.768 --> 39:18.437
"Yeah, there's worse ways to go, right?"

39:24.214 --> 39:26.070
What the fuck am I thinking?

39:26.273 --> 39:29.259
No! No, I don't want...
I don't want to die!

39:29.295 --> 39:31.753
I don't wanna fucking die,
so how do I get out of here?

39:33.260 --> 39:34.562
All right, I'm coming!

39:35.697 --> 39:37.384
Come on! Come on!

39:58.903 --> 40:00.013
Wyatt!

40:27.181 --> 40:29.424
Spasiba. Spasiba.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.744
Da, da, da.

40:45.097 --> 40:47.257
- Hey, well done.
- Eh?

40:47.293 --> 40:50.919
I figured someone should say it. We
stopped Idrisi getting the missiles out.

40:50.967 --> 40:52.762
Jane the chemical weapons.

40:52.856 --> 40:57.184
If this goes all right, we've protected
the whole of British military, so...

40:57.223 --> 40:59.372
What do you want, Mac, a medal?

40:59.450 --> 41:01.744
- I'd settle for a nice cold beer.
- Shit, yeah.

41:01.780 --> 41:05.187
I could do with a hot
shower. Any kind of shower.

41:05.223 --> 41:06.938
Alright. Let's do this shit.

41:07.679 --> 41:09.045
The server...

41:16.705 --> 41:18.589
One previous careful owner.

41:28.893 --> 41:30.133
The Atlas...

41:42.474 --> 41:45.583
The Atlas. Fair is fair.

41:48.759 --> 41:50.341
Check the encryption held.

42:32.541 --> 42:35.949
We're good. Encryption held.
They didn't manage to clone it.

42:38.201 --> 42:40.074
So, are we done here?

42:44.020 --> 42:45.812
Yeah. We are done.

42:51.222 --> 42:54.749
Here we go. The double cross.

42:58.103 --> 42:59.193
Hey, big fella!

43:01.509 --> 43:04.745
- Pick a number between one and ten.
- I don't understand.

43:04.781 --> 43:07.163
- Go on, just guess.
- Come on! Any number!

43:07.303 --> 43:09.449
- Why?
- I don't know.

43:10.262 --> 43:12.957
Maybe I'm just buying time because some

43:12.993 --> 43:15.003
tosspot's supposed to be giving us cover!

43:15.124 --> 43:16.594
What for?

43:27.420 --> 43:28.601
Move! Move!

43:35.900 --> 43:36.724
Mac!

43:58.104 --> 44:00.147
Come on, Wyatt, come on!

44:01.384 --> 44:02.944
Alright. Go ahead!

44:03.010 --> 44:04.788
Move! Take it!

44:07.586 --> 44:08.938
Here they come!

44:11.750 --> 44:15.784
- Novin, do you think you can outrun them?
- I reckon I'll give it a try.

44:15.905 --> 44:17.213
Hold on!
