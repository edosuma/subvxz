Look at her,
not bending her knees.

17:17.100 --> 17:18.435
Are you so bad
at reading body language

17:18.435 --> 17:19.853
because yours
are so small?

17:22.397 --> 17:23.565
Hey, Melissa?

17:23.565 --> 17:25.943
Hey.
I'm -- I'm sorry.

17:25.943 --> 17:28.195
I was just trying to fix your
relationship with your sister,

17:28.195 --> 17:30.197
not re-create an episode
of "The Sopranos."

17:30.197 --> 17:31.657
Is that offensive?
I haven't seen it.

17:31.657 --> 17:33.700
I don't know.
No, I knew
what I was risking

17:33.700 --> 17:36.161
when I invited you
over to the house.

17:36.161 --> 17:38.247
I brought this on
myself.

17:38.247 --> 17:39.873
I don't want to undercut
my apology

17:39.873 --> 17:41.375
by over-explaining
my behavior...

17:41.375 --> 17:43.335
Sure you don't.
What is it, Janine?

17:43.335 --> 17:47.172
I have been missing my sister
a lot lately,

17:47.172 --> 17:49.174
and I can't imagine
having her down the street

17:49.174 --> 17:51.593
and not speaking to her
over a potato substitution.

17:51.593 --> 17:52.761
And I get that food's
important to you.

17:52.761 --> 17:55.013
It's not about the gnocchi,
Janine.

17:55.013 --> 17:56.473
There are members
of my family

17:56.473 --> 17:59.184
that still have a vendetta
against her over that dish,

17:59.184 --> 18:01.603
but Kristin Marie left
my whole family high and dry

18:01.603 --> 18:03.230
when my nana got sick.

18:03.230 --> 18:04.856
She said, "Oh, I can't handle
seeing her like this,"

18:04.856 --> 18:06.775
and she just disappeared,

18:06.775 --> 18:10.070
and I was left to take care
of her by myself.

18:10.070 --> 18:11.530
And then she brings
a Tupperware

18:11.530 --> 18:13.115
full of hot garbage
to the funeral?

18:13.115 --> 18:14.950
That was just the nail
in the coffin.

18:14.950 --> 18:16.827
Metaphorically.
Nana was cremated.

18:16.827 --> 18:19.121
I miss
seeing her though.

18:19.121 --> 18:21.832
It was nice to have fun
with her like that again.

18:21.832 --> 18:23.166
Really?

18:23.166 --> 18:24.626
Yeah, ya know. Family.
It's complicated.

18:24.626 --> 18:26.086
[ Snickers ]

18:26.086 --> 18:28.171
Yeah,
that is for sure.

18:28.171 --> 18:29.881
Yeah.

18:29.881 --> 18:32.050
I wish my mom taught me
how to cook.

18:32.050 --> 18:34.219
Hey.

18:34.219 --> 18:36.054
Why don't you and me
make some time

18:36.054 --> 18:37.973
to do another
cooking lesson, alright?

18:37.973 --> 18:39.766
So you don't hurt someone.
[ Chuckles ]

18:39.766 --> 18:41.101
Okay?

18:41.101 --> 18:42.477
Oh, and no Jacob.
He's not invited.

18:44.146 --> 18:46.481
Oh, I-I'm not invited?

18:46.481 --> 18:50.068
Now, our ice cube melted
and then turned into water,

18:50.068 --> 18:53.572
but we left that water in
the sun, and then it evaporated.

18:53.572 --> 18:54.865
Now, does anyone know --

[ Vocalizing

19:00.287 --> 19:02.497
[ Gasps ] Bluey!

19:02.497 --> 19:03.999
Huh? What?

19:03.999 --> 19:05.042
What was that, Bluey?

19:05.042 --> 19:06.376
Uh-huh. Yeah.

19:06.376 --> 19:08.337
[ Chuckles ]

19:08.337 --> 19:09.796
Bluey, you so crazy.

19:09.796 --> 19:11.840
Oh, Bluey is so funny.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.009
But she said that she knows
what state

19:14.009 --> 19:15.344
the evaporated water is in.

19:15.344 --> 19:16.720
Does anyone else?

19:17.679 --> 19:19.431
Okay, Micah, come on up.

19:19.431 --> 19:22.142
Now you know
he don't know.

19:23.477 --> 19:28.940
Okay, now, is the water a solid,
a liquid, or a gas?

19:32.611 --> 19:34.613
Enh! Wrong.

19:34.613 --> 19:35.947
Not quite, buddy.

19:35.947 --> 19:37.449
But that's okay.

19:37.449 --> 19:39.576
Thank you for trying.

19:39.576 --> 19:41.411
Now, does anybody else
want to give it a go?

19:42.996 --> 19:45.540
Mr. Eddie, you didn't send
anyone to my office today.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.876
Oh, I feel like I got
the situation under control.

19:47.876 --> 19:49.711
Well, you know you don't need
a misbehaving student

19:49.711 --> 19:51.004
to stop by my office.

19:51.004 --> 19:52.881
You could always
just come say hi.

19:52.881 --> 19:55.258
And I'd have to be high
to do that.
Oop.

19:55.258 --> 19:57.219
Come on.
Unh-unh.

19:57.219 --> 19:58.553
I don't like this little duo
at all.

19:58.553 --> 20:00.347
Oh, Ava,

20:00.347 --> 20:03.141
I forgot to drop off
that discipline report to you.

20:03.141 --> 20:04.684
You are no longer speaking
to work Ava.

20:04.684 --> 20:07.145
You can drop it off at her desk
or speak to her tomorrow.

I'm sorry,

Mm. So, this one was where
Kristin Marie

20:45.559 --> 20:47.394
and I went to Disney World,
and if you look real close,

20:47.394 --> 20:49.855
you can see there's a bump
on my forehead
