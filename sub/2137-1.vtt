You Jeong-hun Kim Yong-hwa

01:06.776 --> 01:07.568
Impossible?

01:09.487 --> 01:10.905
Turn the impossible into possible!

01:11.363 --> 01:12.323
That's circus!

01:16.494 --> 01:17.161
Why do you reporters

01:17.703 --> 01:19.705
always ask the same questions?

01:29.965 --> 01:30.716
Fascinating right?

Ling Ling! Hit it!

Executive Producers
Wang Zhonglei You Jeong-hun

01:44.730 --> 01:47.817
The main attraction of China's Ronghua Circus

01:49.693 --> 01:53.447
is the baseball-playing lowland gorilla
Ling Ling

01:53.489 --> 01:54.949
Directed by
Kim Young-Hwa

01:54.990 --> 01:57.159
He possesses the power of 20 men

01:57.535 --> 01:59.120
and weighs over 300 kg

01:59.328 --> 02:00.579
This massive gorilla

02:01.163 --> 02:03.833
is trained to perform

02:04.208 --> 02:06.127
by this 15-year old girl Weiwei

02:06.377 --> 02:07.545
Mr.GO

02:08.086 --> 02:11.215
Shall we take a look at their story?

02:11.632 --> 02:12.466
Spin some more!

02:13.050 --> 02:14.593
Ling Ling only shares bananas

02:14.927 --> 02:17.179
with the ringmaster

02:18.597 --> 02:19.223
Watch your left hand

02:21.976 --> 02:25.104
Since she was born

02:25.312 --> 02:27.148
the ringmaster has been with Ling Ling

02:28.816 --> 02:30.901
and stupid Ling Ling thinks of her

02:31.152 --> 02:33.654
as his own mother! So dimwitted

02:34.613 --> 02:36.782
When the ringmaster comes near

02:37.074 --> 02:39.201
she smells like a gorilla

02:42.371 --> 02:43.205
Yes correct

02:43.998 --> 02:45.708
The two of them are like family

02:46.292 --> 02:47.626
so they eat and sleep together

02:48.043 --> 02:49.420
They are not master and beast

02:49.712 --> 02:51.338
but more like two siblings

02:51.547 --> 02:52.548
For some reason

02:53.132 --> 02:59.180
Weiwei started to teach Ling Ling
human language

02:59.722 --> 03:00.472
Not to mention

03:00.681 --> 03:03.225
she taught him the hard language of Chinese

03:03.517 --> 03:04.268
Incredible!

03:04.518 --> 03:07.354
To be able to understand
over 2000 linguistic words

03:07.938 --> 03:11.275
But this girl is the most incredible

03:12.026 --> 03:12.610
Frederic Pearl Age 46

03:12.818 --> 03:13.736
Primate Protection Association Ethologist

03:14.028 --> 03:15.571
She's talking with the gorilla

03:17.156 --> 03:18.657
They're communicating

03:20.159 --> 03:21.619
Perfectly? Perfectly!

03:21.911 --> 03:25.873
But why would she teach him to play baseball?

03:26.457 --> 03:29.251
Baseball is not a popular sport in China

03:31.503 --> 03:33.255
The old ringmaster was a baseball

03:38.928 --> 03:40.137
fanatic

03:40.346 --> 03:42.431
But he was not really
into the sport of baseball

03:42.890 --> 03:44.600
he was addicted to baseball gambling

03:48.020 --> 03:49.271
He didn't even understand the game!

03:50.189 --> 03:51.106
Crazy old fart!

03:52.733 --> 03:53.525
Ironically though

03:54.276 --> 03:55.861
Weiwei started liking baseball

03:56.320 --> 03:58.656
because of that old fart's gambling debt!

04:02.743 --> 04:05.037
Thanks to the baseball-playing gorilla

04:05.079 --> 04:07.081
Ronghua Circus gained a lot of popularity

04:07.581 --> 04:11.377
But their happiness didn't last very long

04:12.419 --> 04:15.214
Ronghua Circus was soon hit
with financial crisis

04:15.881 --> 04:17.173
It all began because of

04:17.423 --> 04:20.594
a new gorilla named Leiting

04:21.928 --> 04:23.973
He said that since we have a gorilla that hits

04:24.306 --> 04:26.225
we also needed a gorilla that pitches

04:26.725 --> 04:30.437
He really was losing his mind!

04:31.438 --> 04:32.940
Throw it!

04:37.778 --> 04:39.196
Leiting is terrible!

04:41.031 --> 04:42.241
He's angry all the time!

04:42.700 --> 04:44.159
I hate him! I really hate him!

04:45.869 --> 04:46.870
Leiting throw!

04:52.626 --> 04:53.877
No no that is not right okay?

04:54.086 --> 04:56.797
Mountain gorillas are not breedable

04:57.089 --> 04:58.716
in a man-made zoo okay?

04:59.133 --> 05:01.176
They're very different from lowland gorillas

05:01.635 --> 05:02.928
They're anti-social

05:03.178 --> 05:04.847
and they're aggressive

05:05.097 --> 05:08.642
When they go wild you can't see it coming

05:11.103 --> 05:15.566
And if that wasn't enough

05:19.403 --> 05:23.490
another great crisis befell upon them

05:24.491 --> 05:27.369
when the major May 12th earthquake struck

05:34.209 --> 05:35.336
He got this scar

05:36.170 --> 05:37.212
because of me

05:38.714 --> 05:39.673
while rescuing me

05:42.760 --> 05:46.096
Because of this earthquake

05:47.306 --> 05:51.810
Weiwei lost her grandpa the old ringmaster

05:53.520 --> 05:54.688
Crazy old fart

05:54.938 --> 05:57.566
What to do with his debt now?

05:57.941 --> 06:00.486
His stubbornness got himself killed

06:00.903 --> 06:04.990
He left this burden for Weiwei to handle

06:05.908 --> 06:12.539
Baseball is a game where you start at home
and return home

06:31.558 --> 06:34.436
Her grandfather left behind a huge debt

06:34.853 --> 06:37.689
Ronghua Circus laid in ruins

06:38.357 --> 06:42.027
In order to save the circus they toured around

06:42.319 --> 06:44.071
until they settled in the Yanbian area of Jilin

06:44.738 --> 06:46.907
Weiwei put all her energy

06:47.282 --> 06:48.534
into saving the circus

06:48.867 --> 06:50.994
She couldn't even afford

06:52.162 --> 06:56.750
to mourn for her grandpa

07:00.754 --> 07:03.382
And then Tianjin Finance abruptly came
to settle the debt

07:03.715 --> 07:04.800
Weiwei faced even more hardship

07:05.175 --> 07:08.679
We're going to wait here
for as long as it takes

07:09.263 --> 07:10.055
Lin Xiaogang Age 40
Tianjin Finance CEO

07:10.389 --> 07:11.223
Our position is simple

07:12.099 --> 07:13.600
Just hand over Ling Ling

07:14.685 --> 07:17.771
Ling Ling will fetch us 12 million yuan

07:19.314 --> 07:20.607
Their debt is 6 million

07:21.817 --> 07:24.027
They simply have no intention of paying back

07:24.319 --> 07:25.404
Am I right?

07:28.532 --> 07:29.241
But then out of nowhere

07:29.491 --> 07:32.286
a new hope arrived!

07:33.120 --> 07:35.789
It was none other than a surprise visit

07:36.248 --> 07:38.208
by Korea's top sports agent Sung Choong-su!

07:42.379 --> 07:44.882
Agent Sung's the best!

07:45.090 --> 07:45.591
Hyun-jin Ryu Korea

07:45.841 --> 07:46.717
Major League Baseball Pitcher

07:47.009 --> 07:48.385
He's world-class!

07:48.677 --> 07:49.928
But why did he go to China?

07:55.934 --> 07:57.102
Just look at his wrist work!

07:57.561 --> 07:57.936
Shin-soo Choo Korea

07:58.187 --> 07:58.812
Major League Baseball Batter

07:59.062 --> 07:59.480
That's crazy

07:59.771 --> 08:00.272
Even without backswing

08:00.564 --> 08:01.607
he could hit a 160 km/h pitch

08:02.107 --> 08:03.692
He'll be a big star in the Major League

08:04.860 --> 08:05.819
Is he really coming to Korea?

08:10.407 --> 08:13.785
Agent Sung was filled with conviction

08:14.077 --> 08:15.078
Turn that off

08:15.412 --> 08:18.749
So is Ling Ling going to be able
to go to Korea?

08:18.957 --> 08:22.085
Our medical staff was brought in to conduct

08:22.419 --> 08:27.424
musculoskeletal exam
and after careful examination...

08:28.675 --> 08:29.551
What the...

08:31.261 --> 08:32.221
Stop!

08:33.096 --> 08:34.932
Stop!

08:35.890 --> 08:36.933
But commissioner

08:37.267 --> 08:38.727
In the KBO's official rule book

08:39.019 --> 08:42.563
it doesn't state that a team
must consist of 9 humans

08:42.773 --> 08:43.232
Yoon Tae Jin Age 61

08:43.524 --> 08:44.399
KBO Commissioner

08:44.691 --> 08:46.276
Even if he's got the skills and knows the rules

08:46.693 --> 08:47.986
this is beyond preposterous

08:48.278 --> 08:50.197
Man is his own worst enemy

08:50.489 --> 08:53.867
A trained animal is much safer

08:54.409 --> 08:55.536
than an irrational man

08:56.495 --> 08:58.121
Do you remember this photo?

08:58.789 --> 09:00.207
Humanity's best friend

09:00.499 --> 09:01.625
Let me hold it up to you

09:01.875 --> 09:02.876
Take a look

09:03.877 --> 09:06.755
45-year old gorilla Ling Ling

09:07.923 --> 09:10.634
a 6 million yuan debt

09:11.635 --> 09:13.595
45 orphans in the circus

09:14.805 --> 09:17.182
the untamable Leiting

09:18.100 --> 09:21.353
and mounting pressure by Tianjin Finance

09:22.563 --> 09:25.065
How can 15-year old Weiwei

09:25.649 --> 09:29.486
overcome these impossible obstacles?

09:30.070 --> 09:31.905
It's not my debt! Grandpa's dead!

09:32.239 --> 09:33.073
Stop bothering us!

09:33.407 --> 09:34.908
I will never give up Ling Ling!

09:36.243 --> 09:37.077
We'll go to Korea!

09:38.495 --> 09:40.289
Hello! I love baseball!

09:43.667 --> 09:46.503
Grandpa said Korea is the land of baseball

09:47.504 --> 09:50.382
I'll make money and come back to pay the debt

09:52.551 --> 09:54.678
I still want to be in the circus

09:55.762 --> 09:56.805
We'll start a new circus!

09:58.974 --> 10:00.976
Circus of the Sun!

10:08.400 --> 10:10.027
I love baseball!

10:10.277 --> 10:13.071
That scene in particular is heartbreaking

10:13.363 --> 10:15.490
and so moving

10:21.079 --> 10:21.997
Mr. Secretary

10:22.748 --> 10:25.542
shall we collect the ballots?

10:27.002 --> 10:29.254
We'll collect the ballots now gentlemen

10:30.130 --> 10:31.548
We'll really get 50%

10:32.090 --> 10:35.093
of the Jamsil stadium ticket revenue?

10:35.761 --> 10:37.387
It's a done deal then

10:37.638 --> 10:38.430
Is that even a question?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.349
It's Doosan we're talking about

10:40.682 --> 10:41.808
Enough chatter!

10:42.059 --> 10:43.935
He's a man of his word

10:44.227 --> 10:45.437
Aren't you GM Kim?

10:45.771 --> 10:46.897
Indeed

10:47.981 --> 10:50.275
Can we stop talking about money?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.570
After such a moving story

10:53.904 --> 10:56.865
you're still talking about money?

10:57.574 --> 11:00.494
Couldn't we approach it from

11:00.994 --> 11:02.496
a humane point of view?

11:03.288 --> 11:06.416
You really are something

11:06.917 --> 11:09.544
Still thinking like an athlete

11:10.629 --> 11:12.214
For peace on earth

11:12.464 --> 11:14.966
out of love and compassion

11:15.342 --> 11:16.885
you've rescued a gorilla

11:21.598 --> 11:23.392
Commissioner! Sir!

11:28.063 --> 11:28.980
Why are you here?

11:29.564 --> 11:32.859
I'm here as the Doosan Bears' scout

11:33.402 --> 11:35.487
Please have some respect sir

11:35.737 --> 11:38.198
My respect is not for scumbags like you!

11:38.448 --> 11:40.367
You've sold off every decent player to the US

11:40.659 --> 11:42.452
and as if that's not enough

11:42.828 --> 11:43.870
You even sold off kids!

11:44.162 --> 11:45.622
How are they all doing now?

11:46.748 --> 11:47.999
Look at your Doosan GM

11:48.417 --> 11:50.168
How well did he do after you sent him to Japan?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.295
Agent?

11:53.672 --> 11:55.716
You're a goddamn bounty hunter!

11:56.299 --> 11:58.260
The result of the vote is 9:1

11:58.468 --> 11:59.886
9 for and 1 against

12:00.178 --> 12:02.723
As per Doosan's request for a gorilla player...

12:03.056 --> 12:03.932
Commissioner

12:04.182 --> 12:06.101
have I shipped them off to die?

12:06.309 --> 12:08.395
They're in the Major League or in Japan

12:08.770 --> 12:09.688
raking in millions!

12:09.980 --> 12:10.480
Reporter Kim

12:10.814 --> 12:11.565
The result is

12:11.857 --> 12:12.941
9 for and 1 against

12:13.316 --> 12:14.234
Go ahead with the article

12:16.111 --> 12:18.029
The league has spoken

12:18.530 --> 12:19.448
so within today

12:20.532 --> 12:21.408
you must give the seal of approval

12:23.910 --> 12:24.536
How dare you!

12:32.627 --> 12:35.046
Mr. Commissioner!

12:37.215 --> 12:38.633
Let go of me!

12:39.301 --> 12:40.552
You bastard! How dare you!

12:40.802 --> 12:44.514
Ronghua circus

12:45.557 --> 12:47.434
Weiwei how are you?

12:47.768 --> 12:48.685
Mr. Agent?

12:48.894 --> 12:51.188
Yeah is Ling Ling practicing hard?

12:51.688 --> 12:52.522
Practice?

12:52.773 --> 12:53.607
Baseball practice

12:53.857 --> 12:54.983
I told you to practice regularly

12:56.485 --> 12:58.653
We'll start when we get the contract

12:59.362 --> 13:01.490
Are you threatening me?

13:02.073 --> 13:04.993
So where's our contract and deposit?

13:05.202 --> 13:07.662
You'll get it! One as thick as my arm!

13:07.996 --> 13:09.498
Anyway don't miss the flight tomorrow!

13:09.706 --> 13:10.665
Got it?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.878
Emergency assembly! Halt the practice!

13:15.462 --> 13:16.755
Get to your hiding spot!

13:19.132 --> 13:21.259
Over here Ling Ling!

13:22.260 --> 13:23.053
Here quick!

13:28.391 --> 13:29.392
Come here and get down!

13:37.234 --> 13:39.236
Zhao Weiwei!

13:41.112 --> 13:44.324
Zhao Weiwei!

13:48.245 --> 13:49.496
Boss!

13:49.830 --> 13:50.956
You bite me?

14:10.392 --> 14:11.351
Boss!

14:19.609 --> 14:22.237
I'll pay you back I promise

14:23.113 --> 14:25.740
Why pay? Don't bother

14:26.825 --> 14:29.077
Make a lot of money and keep it

14:29.744 --> 14:31.121
It's so hard to pay off a debt

14:31.872 --> 14:35.208
We just want that gorilla

14:36.251 --> 14:37.460
Ling Ling the baseball player

14:40.672 --> 14:41.715
Give me the key

14:42.382 --> 14:43.258
little miss

14:54.644 --> 14:58.481
You got a knack for making things worst

14:59.274 --> 15:02.527
You're testing my patience...

15:03.194 --> 15:05.488
Ronghua Circus never bows
to the forces of evil!

15:09.284 --> 15:13.038
Ronghua Circus never bows
to the forces of evil!

15:19.377 --> 15:20.128
Forces of evil?

15:29.304 --> 15:29.763
Leiting!

15:30.388 --> 15:31.014
Stop it!

15:38.772 --> 15:39.272
Stop!

15:40.941 --> 15:41.483
Enough Leiting!

15:41.858 --> 15:42.692
Stop!

15:45.528 --> 15:46.529
That's enough Leiting!

15:57.165 --> 15:58.124
Boss look!

16:05.715 --> 16:07.759
Leiting be quiet! Stop it!

16:09.678 --> 16:11.680
This is why you're in chains!

16:13.807 --> 16:16.101
Just stop and shut up!

16:46.089 --> 16:47.340
Your name is Sunny not Sonny

16:48.550 --> 16:50.260
You can't even write your own name

16:50.802 --> 16:51.594
I don't like that

16:52.345 --> 16:53.013
Stupid Sunny

16:53.638 --> 16:54.264
If you don't study

16:54.889 --> 16:56.349
then when I make it big in Korea

16:56.891 --> 16:57.517
I won't come back

16:59.728 --> 17:01.980
I'll study hard ringmaster

17:15.076 --> 17:16.536
And what happens if the loan sharks come back?

17:17.203 --> 17:21.040
Ronghua Circus never bows
to the forces of evil!

17:21.790 --> 17:26.128
Ronghua Circus never bows
to the forces of evil!

17:29.883 --> 17:30.550
Let's go!

17:47.150 --> 17:48.026
Ringmaster!

17:48.818 --> 17:49.778
Ringmaster!

17:53.323 --> 17:55.825
Don't come back empty-handed!

17:56.159 --> 17:58.453
You have to make lots of money!

17:59.996 --> 18:02.207
We have to start Circus of the Sun!

18:03.166 --> 18:04.084
Ringmaster!

18:12.008 --> 18:14.219
Ringmaster!

18:15.512 --> 18:16.721
Ringmaster!

18:37.575 --> 18:39.327
Weiwei here!

18:39.828 --> 18:42.580
Weiwei! Over here!

18:43.289 --> 18:45.667
Here!

18:47.585 --> 18:48.336
Behave yourself

18:50.547 --> 18:52.257
Over here!

18:52.590 --> 18:55.468
You look worried coach

18:59.180 --> 19:00.181
Welcome!

19:05.812 --> 19:06.980
He remembers me see?

19:07.730 --> 19:09.816
He's happy to see me

19:10.358 --> 19:12.402
That's how he greets

19:13.361 --> 19:15.697
I didn't think he'd remember me

19:17.740 --> 19:18.324
Welcome!

19:18.700 --> 19:19.492
Behave Ling Ling!

19:21.369 --> 19:23.496
Yeah I remember you too!

19:24.080 --> 19:28.042
Good to see you!

19:38.970 --> 19:40.346
This is ESPN's Lee Jung-min

19:40.388 --> 19:40.805
Yes?

19:41.055 --> 19:43.016
Ms. Zhao where did you learn Korean?

19:43.975 --> 19:46.853
When our circus got to Yanbian

19:47.145 --> 19:48.188
the people there can speak it

19:48.605 --> 19:51.441
How do you communicate with the gorilla?

19:52.525 --> 19:53.151
Ling Ling

20:02.327 --> 20:03.912
Ha Byung-chun from Yonhap News

20:04.370 --> 20:06.164
A question for Doosan GM

20:06.956 --> 20:09.792
Why did you decide to recruit a gorilla
into your team?

20:11.294 --> 20:12.670
Do you still think

20:12.754 --> 20:14.172
we rule this world?

20:15.089 --> 20:16.674
Just because we can talk...

20:18.801 --> 20:20.470
When we shipped Shin-soo Choo
off to the Major League

20:20.720 --> 20:21.804
you also brought an x-ray

20:22.138 --> 20:23.097
saying something about his ligament

20:23.848 --> 20:26.267
He has hit 30 home runs in the States

20:26.559 --> 20:27.644
and got a third kid on the way

20:27.977 --> 20:28.770
Read the papers?

20:29.103 --> 20:29.812
What about your Doosan GM?

20:30.605 --> 20:31.731
He retired early from his injury

20:31.940 --> 20:32.857
because you didn't listen

20:34.067 --> 20:35.485
This is a similar situation

20:35.860 --> 20:37.862
His knee is in bad shape

20:38.780 --> 20:41.658
This is the spirit of Doosan

20:42.075 --> 20:42.951
This time I have to report this

20:43.243 --> 20:44.035
Report what?

20:44.744 --> 20:47.080
That your body swept up from the Han River?

20:47.538 --> 20:49.499
Or that your entire family died
in a house fire?

20:49.999 --> 20:50.667
Is that what you want?

20:51.292 --> 20:53.127
You better not talk to anybody or else

20:53.336 --> 20:54.587
Who else knows?

20:55.380 --> 20:56.422
The orthopedics manager

21:04.347 --> 21:05.932
Tell him to give me a call

21:06.266 --> 21:09.602
and take your family out to a nice dinner

21:10.061 --> 21:12.021
I have a question for Weiwei

21:12.605 --> 21:14.315
Why do you like baseball?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.903
Because baseball

21:21.531 --> 21:23.074
is a game where you start at home

21:23.950 --> 21:26.369
and return home

21:27.078 --> 21:27.870
That's why I like it

21:28.121 --> 21:30.415
Start at home and return home

21:30.873 --> 21:33.459
She's got an interesting philosophy on the game

21:35.878 --> 21:37.213
He has to stay in there

21:37.672 --> 21:38.715
Nowhere else

21:39.257 --> 21:40.300
I won't repeat myself

21:43.886 --> 21:47.557
How come you're so rich Mister?

21:48.349 --> 21:49.309
Just you wait

21:49.684 --> 21:51.185
You'll be rich soon too

21:53.146 --> 21:56.316
Then why do people call you the bounty hunter?

21:56.607 --> 21:57.442
Curious?

21:57.775 --> 21:58.818
Aren't you a baseball fan?

21:59.027 --> 22:02.447
Chang-yong Sun-woo Shin-soo Tae-gyun...

22:02.739 --> 22:03.614
Know them right?

22:04.032 --> 22:06.784
I got them signed to
American and Japanese clubs

22:07.118 --> 22:08.786
I'm a super agent in Asia

22:09.037 --> 22:12.790
But they say that I sold them off

22:13.916 --> 22:15.001
so they call me the bounty hunter

22:15.668 --> 22:16.836
I don't care about Korean baseball

22:17.503 --> 22:18.171
So boring

22:19.839 --> 22:22.175
You better love it quick

22:22.425 --> 22:25.053
Make extra effort to love it

22:28.056 --> 22:30.350
You hear me?

22:37.690 --> 22:38.775
He's making his bed

22:40.818 --> 22:44.197
That's why I said it's better
that he stays inside

22:45.490 --> 22:46.366
That's a Japanese hinoki

22:49.452 --> 22:50.411
from a Fukuoka seedling

22:51.120 --> 22:51.788
So?

22:52.163 --> 22:54.248
It's incredibly rare

22:56.834 --> 22:57.877
Worth $60000

22:59.170 --> 23:00.046
$60000?

23:02.465 --> 23:03.591
Including the importing fees

23:26.781 --> 23:28.616
Let him stay inside with me

23:29.075 --> 23:29.700
He'll behave better

23:43.423 --> 23:45.258
He better stay away from my orchids

23:47.093 --> 23:47.844
Go ahead Ling Ling

23:49.679 --> 23:51.681
Go on

23:55.393 --> 23:56.519
Stop! Stop right there!

23:56.686 --> 23:57.353
Stop!

23:59.272 --> 24:00.148
That's enough

24:00.773 --> 24:02.900
If he wanders off to other areas

24:03.609 --> 24:05.027
That's a real rifle

24:05.361 --> 24:06.237
You get what I mean? No mercy

24:06.863 --> 24:07.864
No hesitation

24:08.197 --> 24:11.200
End of your life got it?

24:30.011 --> 24:30.636
Mister

24:31.512 --> 24:33.806
I need $800000 by National Day

24:34.140 --> 24:35.349
so I can pay off the debt

24:35.975 --> 24:38.060
Already haggling me about money

24:39.103 --> 24:40.605
You need a lesson

24:41.063 --> 24:41.939
Follow me outside

24:58.789 --> 25:02.210
When will I see the contract and deposit?

25:03.252 --> 25:04.504
Soon!

25:05.379 --> 25:06.839
You need $1 million right?

25:07.089 --> 25:08.049
It's not my debt

25:08.633 --> 25:09.717
Fine

25:09.967 --> 25:11.511
Add a zero at the end and what do you get?

25:12.386 --> 25:13.179
$10 million!

25:13.387 --> 25:14.805
55.13 million yuan!

25:15.431 --> 25:16.390
One more zero!

25:17.308 --> 25:18.267
$100 million!

25:18.559 --> 25:20.520
551.3 million yuan!

25:20.937 --> 25:23.147
You're smarter than you look

25:24.398 --> 25:26.359
That's our target all right

25:26.817 --> 25:30.238
What you just said... $100 million!

25:30.530 --> 25:32.198
We only need $1 million

25:32.782 --> 25:34.700
Then we can open Circus of the Sun!

25:35.034 --> 25:35.993
Circus?

25:36.494 --> 25:37.411
Of the Sun?

25:37.995 --> 25:39.789
All that hard work for so little

25:40.122 --> 25:42.375
You think there's a pot of gold in the end?

25:42.959 --> 25:45.044
Only illness awaits you

25:45.336 --> 25:47.380
I got diabetes!

25:48.256 --> 25:48.965
Enough about that

25:49.173 --> 25:50.591
What should we do now?

25:56.556 --> 25:57.306
Stupid

26:04.063 --> 26:07.233
Doosan Bears Welcomes Mr.Go

26:16.325 --> 26:17.118
No

26:18.244 --> 26:19.203
That is not where our home is

26:21.122 --> 26:23.291
It is over there

26:24.333 --> 26:25.960
Really far away

26:36.012 --> 26:37.471
I'll continue so listen carefully

26:37.930 --> 26:39.348
We're going to USA

26:39.599 --> 26:41.017
So why come to Korea first?

26:41.434 --> 26:43.185
To verify his skills

26:43.477 --> 26:45.104
Korea is just a starting point

26:45.354 --> 26:48.065
It's a test bed for our dreams!

26:48.566 --> 26:49.525
Just the first touchstone

26:50.985 --> 26:52.361
What? Scared?

26:53.279 --> 26:55.239
We got to go for it first

26:55.531 --> 26:57.825
If there is a door we open it

26:58.242 --> 27:00.077
If there's someone inside just say hello

27:01.787 --> 27:04.248
We'll do what we do best

27:04.832 --> 27:06.459
Our training here will be the same

27:07.918 --> 27:10.338
Sounds good? Can you do it?

27:14.425 --> 27:16.052
I'm just giving you a massage

27:21.891 --> 27:24.185
He mimicks you if he likes you

27:24.685 --> 27:25.436
Anyway

27:25.728 --> 27:27.563
Tomorrow's the first game

27:27.813 --> 27:30.066
Let's fire this team up!

27:30.650 --> 27:32.276
Let's show them what we got!

27:32.693 --> 27:35.529
Zhao Weiwei!

27:36.530 --> 27:39.825
Where could she be?

27:40.034 --> 27:42.995
Ronghua Circus never bows to...

27:50.294 --> 28:03.599
I still don't feel safe with him around

28:04.975 --> 28:05.643
Tranquilize him?

28:05.851 --> 28:06.644
Yes!

28:07.561 --> 28:08.562
Do it!

28:35.047 --> 28:36.549
What should we do?

28:37.007 --> 28:38.092
Get him!

28:40.302 --> 28:41.220
Do it!

28:42.930 --> 28:44.807
Keep doing it!

28:48.269 --> 28:49.228
Faster!

28:49.854 --> 28:52.523
Welcome back everyone! Today marks

28:52.857 --> 28:54.900
Mr. Go's controversial and historic debut

28:55.192 --> 28:58.738
Doosan Bears has fallen on hard times lately

28:59.155 --> 29:01.991
NC must be utterly stumped

29:02.450 --> 29:04.285
to be the gorilla's first opponent

29:04.744 --> 29:07.121
NC coach looks flabbergasted

29:07.371 --> 29:08.956
He's belittling Doosan!

29:09.373 --> 29:10.374
Wouldn't you feel the same?

29:10.583 --> 29:12.710
Rather than going to the plate

29:13.085 --> 29:14.128
Mr. Go is following Weiwei

29:14.462 --> 29:15.379
That's understandable

29:15.838 --> 29:17.590
He's not used to the stadium

29:18.382 --> 29:19.175
Move aside

29:21.886 --> 29:23.053
Don't worry coach

29:24.972 --> 29:25.639
just watch

29:25.890 --> 29:27.850
Let's see if he'll start a new chapter

29:28.309 --> 29:29.393
in KBO history

29:29.685 --> 29:30.478
I'd say the latter

29:30.895 --> 29:33.189
because it'll be a treat for the fans to enjoy

29:33.856 --> 29:34.482
Over there!

29:37.902 --> 29:38.944
Mr. Go is still with her

29:39.236 --> 29:41.530
Weiwei looks frustrated

29:41.864 --> 29:43.407
She's embarrassed as his master

29:43.657 --> 29:46.035
He's probably dazed and confused

29:46.410 --> 29:48.621
He can't tell a zoo from a stadium

29:48.954 --> 29:49.830
Not sure what to do

29:50.039 --> 29:50.831
Go over there!

29:53.209 --> 29:55.336
Weiwei made some weird sounds

29:55.753 --> 29:57.338
She's telling him to take his place

29:57.713 --> 29:59.673
You see that often in National Geographic

30:00.090 --> 30:02.176
I watched it last night
because I couldn't sleep

30:02.468 --> 30:04.094
Is that so?

30:04.470 --> 30:05.763
He's heading for the home plate now

30:06.138 --> 30:08.140
And the crowd is brimming with curiosity

30:17.817 --> 30:19.735
He just sat down on the ground?

30:21.111 --> 30:22.780
Why?

30:23.197 --> 30:25.282
Just watch

30:25.658 --> 30:28.369
He's saying "I am angry and I don't want
to talk to you!"

30:28.744 --> 30:30.496
That's what he means

30:31.288 --> 30:32.581
Ling Ling! Get up!

30:33.999 --> 30:34.875
Ling Ling!

30:37.169 --> 30:39.338
Do you think the game can continue like this?

30:39.672 --> 30:42.508
It's up to the umpire

30:42.800 --> 30:44.760
The umpire makes the calls

30:45.261 --> 30:46.428
The pitcher can play as usual

30:46.846 --> 30:49.098
It's a man's game so the animal has to adapt

30:49.348 --> 30:50.933
1st pitch to Mr. Go!

30:51.559 --> 30:52.685
A huge hit to the right field!

30:53.185 --> 30:54.395
And it's still going!

30:54.770 --> 30:55.980
It's a foul to the right field

30:56.188 --> 30:57.273
Foul! It's a foul!

30:57.648 --> 30:58.983
See? See?

31:00.025 --> 31:03.153
He smashed Moon's 128 km/h curve pitch!

31:03.571 --> 31:05.281
How is this possible?

31:05.614 --> 31:06.532
He was sitting down!

31:07.074 --> 31:08.576
He's got the power I'll give him that

31:08.993 --> 31:11.287
Moon should spit out his gum and concentrate!

31:11.662 --> 31:12.454
He spits it out!

31:12.705 --> 31:13.247
Ling Ling!

31:14.665 --> 31:16.083
He must concentrate!

31:16.542 --> 31:18.586
Mr. Go is still sitting down

31:19.295 --> 31:20.504
Moon's 2nd pitch

31:20.880 --> 31:22.840
Another huge hit by Mr. Go!

31:23.132 --> 31:25.301
Left side of the field this time!

31:25.634 --> 31:27.303
Foul!

31:27.636 --> 31:29.763
He hits another monstrous foul
while sitting down

31:30.222 --> 31:31.849
That simply won't do!

31:32.308 --> 31:34.101
Moon shouldn't pitch breaking ball

31:34.476 --> 31:35.644
What did I tell you? He's best at the fastball

31:35.978 --> 31:37.313
Breaking ball is not good enough!

31:37.730 --> 31:39.189
The gorilla's toying with KBO!

31:39.815 --> 31:41.066
Show the ape what we got!

31:42.026 --> 31:43.944
Ling Ling! Do it right!

31:52.995 --> 31:53.704
Look at that

31:54.079 --> 31:54.747
Mr. Go gets up on his feet!

31:55.080 --> 31:56.040
Has he finally adjusted to his surrounding?

31:56.332 --> 31:57.833
Just throw a fastball!

31:58.083 --> 31:59.835
The ape can't hit his powerful fastball

32:00.127 --> 32:03.422
NC's ace Moon looks rather nervous

32:03.756 --> 32:05.716
There's no reason to be

32:06.091 --> 32:08.677
I'm telling you fastball will set him straight

32:08.969 --> 32:10.012
Keep it low!

32:10.346 --> 32:11.055
Two strikes and no balls

32:11.388 --> 32:13.015
Here comes the 3rd pitch!

32:36.288 --> 32:37.623
Home run!

32:38.040 --> 32:39.291
Down the center field

32:39.583 --> 32:41.335
and punctures the Jumbotron!

32:41.710 --> 32:43.504
How is this possible?

32:43.837 --> 32:47.174
He smashed Moon's 158 km/h pitch!

32:47.383 --> 32:48.550
Run!

32:48.926 --> 32:51.303
An unprecedented event unfolded
before our eyes!

33:14.201 --> 33:15.828
All bases loaded

33:16.161 --> 33:17.955
Mr. Go inevitably steps up to the plate!

33:18.288 --> 33:20.916
He was given permission to play without helmet

33:21.750 --> 33:23.919
See that pumping chest motion?

33:24.336 --> 33:25.129
He's confident!

33:25.671 --> 33:27.715
What will he show us today?

33:28.007 --> 33:30.384
The crowd is reacting thunderously!

33:31.510 --> 33:32.011
The pitcher winds up

33:32.386 --> 33:34.054
and 1st pitch!

33:35.681 --> 33:36.932
Ling Ling! Hit it!

33:37.933 --> 33:38.809
Mr. Go! It's flying high!

33:39.184 --> 33:41.437
A massive hit! I can't see the ball!

33:52.740 --> 33:53.657
Ling Ling! Hit it!

33:58.871 --> 33:59.955
It's high! Home run!

34:13.469 --> 34:14.678
It was a perfectly controlled pitch!

34:14.762 --> 34:15.679
He'll hit it out Of the park!

34:16.138 --> 34:18.639
It's huge! Incredible home run over the fence!

34:45.833 --> 34:48.837
This is Lotte's and Doosan's
8th game of the season!

34:49.463 --> 34:50.214
1st pitch!

34:54.967 --> 34:55.928
It's high! This one's a goner too!

34:56.136 --> 34:57.012
It's going and going!

34:58.388 --> 34:59.515
It hits the fence!

34:59.765 --> 35:01.016
Ling Ling run!

35:01.809 --> 35:02.726
He has to run!

35:05.395 --> 35:06.855
The outfielder slips and falls!

35:07.064 --> 35:08.816
Mr. Go is running!

35:08.857 --> 35:10.984
It's a close game! To the 3rd base!

35:11.568 --> 35:12.986
He hurls the baseman!

35:13.570 --> 35:15.030
Mr. Go's heading for the home plate!

35:15.280 --> 35:17.074
Mr. Go charges!

35:17.407 --> 35:18.450
The catcher jumps out of the way!

35:19.243 --> 35:20.369
No choice! He's got to live
to play another game

35:24.915 --> 35:26.208
We're here at Jamsil Stadium

35:26.542 --> 35:28.210
This is Doosan's and NC's 11th game

35:28.502 --> 35:29.419
NC leads Bases loaded

35:29.837 --> 35:31.171
A chance for Mr. Go's grand slam

35:32.131 --> 35:33.507
What's this?

35:34.007 --> 35:36.135
NC deliberately pitches behind him

35:36.510 --> 35:38.428
This isn't baseball but tricks

35:39.346 --> 35:41.390
They'll avoid facing him all together?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.810
They'll give away a run but not 4

35:45.185 --> 35:47.896
There's nothing Mr. Go can do

35:48.355 --> 35:49.857
Kim directs the ball away from the plate

35:50.357 --> 35:52.109
He nods with satisfaction

35:55.279 --> 35:57.322
Mr. Go looks unhappy

35:58.574 --> 35:59.741
Face him!

36:08.834 --> 36:09.626
He rolled the ball!

36:09.960 --> 36:12.462
What the heck? What's he thinking?

36:12.921 --> 36:13.964
This isn't baseball!

36:14.381 --> 36:15.716
Fans will ridicule this moment

36:15.924 --> 36:17.467
He hits!

36:18.177 --> 36:20.220
Mr. Go swung the bat like a golf club!

36:20.554 --> 36:23.056
The pitcher threw it towards Mr. Go's face!

36:23.515 --> 36:25.350
That was a warning shot by Mr. Go!

36:28.478 --> 36:29.813
He'll play by any rules! You can't fool him

36:30.105 --> 36:31.356
And Kim's 4th pitch!

36:31.690 --> 36:32.983
He jumps! A backﬂip!

36:33.400 --> 36:35.110
Simply incredible! He'll hit everything!

36:35.861 --> 36:37.696
Throw however you want!

36:38.030 --> 36:41.450
His backflip home run is
his 19th of the season!

36:59.927 --> 37:02.888
Home run! A massive hit!

37:03.430 --> 37:05.057
Victory! Another win for Doosan!

37:05.307 --> 37:06.725
Mr. Go's 22nd home run!

37:07.100 --> 37:08.769
Doosan climbs the standing from dead last

37:12.314 --> 37:13.148
to a playoff contender!

37:13.357 --> 37:14.191
Mr. Go is for real!

37:14.483 --> 37:15.817
This marks NC's 5th embarrassing loss
against Doosan!

37:16.068 --> 37:17.152
NC must feel so helpless

37:17.569 --> 37:18.987
What can they do?

37:39.549 --> 37:41.009
What is it?

37:41.343 --> 37:42.552
Why are you calling so early?

37:42.886 --> 37:45.222
This better be good!

37:46.056 --> 37:47.057
Listen carefully

37:47.307 --> 37:50.686
The Chunichi Dragons sent

37:50.978 --> 37:52.521
an acquisition proposal to our office

37:52.813 --> 37:54.606
Could you repeat that please?

37:55.190 --> 37:56.316
Another good news!

37:56.566 --> 37:59.569
The Yomiuri Giants also sent theirs
at the same time!

38:00.028 --> 38:02.990
One more time!

38:04.449 --> 38:05.701
As if they planned it together

38:07.995 --> 38:10.747
They sent their official proposals

38:11.164 --> 38:13.709
at the same time!

38:14.626 --> 38:17.462
Two top Japanese clubs
are foaming at the mouth!

38:20.590 --> 38:22.384
And the tone of both proposals are

38:22.634 --> 38:24.469
incredibly polite and formal

38:25.304 --> 38:27.848
It's not like the other times!

38:28.348 --> 38:30.267
I couldn't believe my eyes!

38:30.767 --> 38:31.601
Reject it

38:31.935 --> 38:32.436
What?

38:32.644 --> 38:34.313
Don't play deaf

38:34.980 --> 38:37.607
Reject both of their offers!

38:38.066 --> 38:40.152
If they're serious

38:40.527 --> 38:41.778
tell them to come themselves

38:42.112 --> 38:43.989
Don't let them mess with us

38:44.323 --> 38:45.490
If they send over

38:45.741 --> 38:48.118
good-for-nothing scouts to haggle over salary

38:48.452 --> 38:50.370
and waste our time like before

38:50.746 --> 38:51.788
they have another thing coming

38:52.247 --> 38:53.498
If they're serious

38:53.832 --> 38:55.667
tell them to call me

38:55.959 --> 38:57.878
but unless their GMs themselves call

38:58.253 --> 38:59.671
I probably won't answer

38:59.963 --> 39:00.630
It's for you

39:00.881 --> 39:03.050
Before Doosan GM and the Commissioner

39:03.633 --> 39:04.760
and press get the official word

39:05.093 --> 39:06.511
don't bring this up

39:08.805 --> 39:09.723
To clarify

39:10.057 --> 39:12.184
Don't even respond to the offers

39:12.476 --> 39:13.810
Just shred the docs

39:15.062 --> 39:15.896
What if we get caught?

39:16.229 --> 39:17.230
If they ask about them later

39:17.898 --> 39:18.732
just say you never received them

39:19.066 --> 39:20.942
or they got lost in the files okay?

39:25.489 --> 39:27.282
So Why is his wrist angle different?

39:27.532 --> 39:28.450
Don't you dare

39:29.368 --> 39:31.328
If he turns his wrists improperly he'll foul

39:31.661 --> 39:34.915
So Mr. Go twists his wrist inward

39:35.332 --> 39:36.541
to hit his home runs

39:36.958 --> 39:38.168
Simply incredible

39:38.543 --> 39:41.380
The more I know about Mr. Go the more I'm awed

39:41.838 --> 39:45.467
I'm now a big fan too

40:08.990 --> 40:09.616
Let's get going!

40:09.866 --> 40:11.201
There's a ceremonial first pitch today

40:11.576 --> 40:14.204
Go on ahead and I'll go later

40:15.497 --> 40:18.417
The club owner's coming to see him play today

40:25.882 --> 40:27.300
Come on Ling Ling!

40:37.352 --> 40:39.980
Bottom of the 5th 1 out Runners
on 1st and 2nd

40:40.272 --> 40:41.523
Kim Do-su is at bat

40:41.857 --> 40:44.693
He has to play smart and not gamble

40:44.985 --> 40:47.279
They're down by 2 and he needs to get on base

40:47.821 --> 40:49.614
He must bunt

40:49.906 --> 40:51.908
And he does

40:52.200 --> 40:53.452
He bunts between the pitcher
and the 1st baseman

40:54.119 --> 40:55.454
Safe! He's safe!

40:55.829 --> 40:57.539
The bases are loaded now!

40:57.873 --> 41:00.167
Isn't this the right moment
to bring out Mr. Go?

41:00.709 --> 41:02.252
What a great game today

41:02.502 --> 41:05.380
The Doosan owner is in attendance
for this precise reason

41:05.630 --> 41:08.008
We see him there on the screen

41:08.425 --> 41:09.843
The chairman of Doosan Group

41:10.260 --> 41:11.094
He's a fierce man!

41:11.386 --> 41:13.722
A renowned figure in the financial industry

41:18.643 --> 41:19.394
Tied up good?

41:19.644 --> 41:20.353
Very firmly

41:21.438 --> 41:26.026
This isn't my fault
because you're responsible for this

41:26.526 --> 41:27.194
Boss more tranquilizer?

41:27.402 --> 41:28.862
That's enough!

41:29.654 --> 41:30.572
Let me talk!

41:33.992 --> 41:38.955
This isn't my fault
because you're responsible for this

41:41.416 --> 41:42.709
Tie him up!

41:43.793 --> 41:45.045
Tranquilize him some more!

41:46.129 --> 41:47.756
Tranquilize him!

42:06.107 --> 42:07.192
Tie him up!

42:10.362 --> 42:11.905
Tie him!

42:16.159 --> 42:18.286
Keep shooting! Don't stop!

42:33.134 --> 42:34.678
Thank you for your patience sir

42:35.011 --> 42:35.845
With the bases loaded

42:36.179 --> 42:38.056
Mr. Go is coming out now

42:38.598 --> 42:40.559
Why is this so tight? That rascal

42:41.059 --> 42:43.812
Forcing me into a uniform after 20 years

42:44.813 --> 42:46.648
I don't see Weiwei today

42:47.148 --> 42:48.149
It's just Mr. Go

42:48.733 --> 42:50.860
Isn't that Ling Ling's agent?

42:51.152 --> 42:52.654
Yes he's an old man now

42:53.029 --> 42:55.490
but he was a ball player briefly

42:55.865 --> 42:56.992
We played in the minors together too

42:57.284 --> 43:00.203
He's capable of coaching despite his age

43:00.996 --> 43:01.538
Ling Ling!

43:01.997 --> 43:04.332
Sung is filling Weiwei's coaching spot!

43:04.749 --> 43:08.044
Let's see how he'll direct Ling Ling

43:09.754 --> 43:10.880
Swing!

43:14.593 --> 43:16.761
Mr. Go didn't react to the pitch at all

43:17.387 --> 43:18.263
He must be confused

43:18.722 --> 43:20.098
If you watch Nat Geo

43:20.473 --> 43:22.642
his actions and behavior suggest confusion

43:24.519 --> 43:25.270
Why isn't he playing?

43:26.062 --> 43:26.980
He will soon

43:28.773 --> 43:31.484
Perhaps Mr. Go didn't understand the signal

43:32.319 --> 43:32.986
Ling Ling!

43:33.612 --> 43:34.779
Sung's signal felt off

43:35.155 --> 43:38.241
It needs to be bigger

43:38.825 --> 43:39.659
The whip wraps around his neck!

43:39.951 --> 43:42.412
The 1st base coach is choking!

43:43.371 --> 43:44.331
Hit it!

43:44.831 --> 43:50.003
Once again Mr. Go does not react!

43:50.462 --> 43:51.671
What's going on?

43:51.921 --> 43:54.007
Sung's not doing it right!

43:54.341 --> 43:55.550
That's it! Swing it hard!

43:59.804 --> 44:00.513
Swing!

44:01.014 --> 44:01.514
What's he doing?

44:01.973 --> 44:03.183
He hits his own face this time

44:03.391 --> 44:03.808
Swing!

44:04.059 --> 44:05.226
I said swing!

44:06.436 --> 44:08.396
Yoon winds up! Here's the pitch!

44:11.107 --> 44:13.151
It's long!

44:13.526 --> 44:16.279
It's going!

44:16.988 --> 44:20.075
Ling Ling! Run!

44:29.209 --> 44:30.418
Out of the way!

44:30.710 --> 44:31.711
That's not the ball!

44:31.961 --> 44:34.547
Watch out! That is the bat!

44:38.343 --> 44:40.762
The bat strikes a spectator

44:41.262 --> 44:44.099
I hope he's not badly injured

44:44.599 --> 44:45.558
A direct hit

44:46.059 --> 44:47.560
right onto his forehead

44:48.186 --> 44:49.187
This is unprecedented

44:49.854 --> 44:52.649
He's being carried out of the stadium

44:53.024 --> 44:55.860
This marks Mr. Go's first ever strikeout

44:59.072 --> 45:00.949
Come back Ling Ling

45:02.659 --> 45:04.828
One might say Weiwei is sorely missed

45:07.789 --> 45:10.959
It didn't look like Mr. Go
did that intentionally

45:14.462 --> 45:16.005
What is Mr. Go doing?

45:16.798 --> 45:18.258
He wants to run

45:18.591 --> 45:20.552
Without Weiwei he wants to get away

45:21.261 --> 45:23.471
I hope there won't be another incident

45:24.013 --> 45:25.390
Mr. Go please come back

45:45.910 --> 45:50.457
The reason for showing you everything

45:55.628 --> 45:57.213
without editing

45:57.464 --> 46:00.884
is to show you how much pain we've suffered

46:01.342 --> 46:04.554
Tianjin Finance's motto is courtesy and trust

46:05.221 --> 46:08.141
and we gave you a loan courteously
and with trust

46:09.142 --> 46:11.811
so even if you have problems with me

46:12.854 --> 46:16.149
pay us back courteously

46:18.443 --> 46:19.736
Stop it!

46:21.446 --> 46:22.489
You're despicable

46:31.748 --> 46:34.709
Why is this happening to me? Money?

46:35.084 --> 46:38.797
You borrowed it and you refuse to pay it back

46:39.547 --> 46:41.925
You're the one who fled to Korea

46:44.052 --> 46:46.679
But people will think that I'm the bad guy

46:46.971 --> 46:49.974
What did I do?

46:50.975 --> 46:51.976
I didn't do anything wrong

47:01.653 --> 47:05.406
Why is this happening to me?

47:07.742 --> 47:09.118
My tooth

47:13.248 --> 47:15.792
It'll be hard to go on

47:17.168 --> 47:19.128
Game over! It's over!

47:20.296 --> 47:21.381
The umpires have decided to cancel the game

47:21.714 --> 47:22.507
Surprised?

47:22.966 --> 47:24.676
Isn't this what we expected?

47:25.093 --> 47:27.136
What did I tell you? That's an animal

47:27.470 --> 47:28.263
A beast!

47:28.680 --> 47:31.182
This is too much even for us

47:33.601 --> 47:34.269
Should we wait?

47:34.477 --> 47:36.437
For what? Call 119 now!

47:40.692 --> 47:41.401
Okay

47:44.028 --> 47:45.280
I'll give you a month

47:46.114 --> 47:47.991
No make that 3 months

47:48.324 --> 47:51.494
3 months to make your money with the gorilla

47:52.120 --> 47:52.871
If you don't...

47:55.331 --> 47:56.875
This is not right

47:58.293 --> 47:59.836
but I have no choice

48:00.503 --> 48:01.379
No choice

48:01.713 --> 48:04.799
I have nothing I can sell

48:08.428 --> 48:09.554
Stand up

48:10.096 --> 48:11.848
Except these kids

48:12.181 --> 48:14.183
Mister are you gonna kill me?

48:14.851 --> 48:16.895
I'm begging you Weiwei

48:17.770 --> 48:18.646
Are you gonna kill me?

48:19.147 --> 48:21.733
No I'm going to sell you

48:28.865 --> 48:31.701
Current altitude at 2500 ft approaching
Jamsil stadium

48:32.076 --> 48:33.411
Dispatched to suppress emergency situation

48:49.260 --> 48:50.053
Out of my way!

48:59.771 --> 49:01.147
Why is he just peeling the bananas?

49:02.482 --> 49:03.358
Get ready

49:04.067 --> 49:04.651
Yes sir

49:08.112 --> 49:09.030
Don't do it!

49:11.199 --> 49:11.991
Don't shoot!

49:13.201 --> 49:14.494
Permission to shoot granted

49:15.787 --> 49:16.663
Don't shoot!

49:18.331 --> 49:19.290
Fire! Capturing target

49:20.875 --> 49:22.293
No!

50:46.210 --> 50:48.254
Sports Management Standard Contract

51:00.558 --> 51:01.476
Incompetent idiots!

51:01.893 --> 51:03.311
Are you shooting King Kong?

51:05.188 --> 51:05.772
Just shoot!

51:06.773 --> 51:07.398
Please stop this

51:07.607 --> 51:08.608
Send the helicopter back

51:20.203 --> 51:22.038
Fire! Suppressing target

51:41.724 --> 51:43.976
Climb! Climb!

51:44.560 --> 51:45.478
Get up there!

52:31.816 --> 52:32.775
Helicopter scram!

52:33.109 --> 52:34.610
Send it away!

52:39.657 --> 52:41.492
Send the helicopter away! It's my gorilla!

52:46.497 --> 52:47.373
Send the chopper away

52:47.748 --> 52:49.417
and assemble the GMs for a meeting

52:51.544 --> 52:54.505
8426 confirm evac from current location

52:54.922 --> 52:56.215
Returning to base

53:00.845 --> 53:04.473
This is insane Dammit!

53:10.563 --> 53:13.816
During the Doosan vs. NC game today
at Jamsil stadium

53:13.900 --> 53:15.943
Doosan Bears' Mr. Go Causes Chaos During Game

53:16.235 --> 53:17.612
Mr. Go threw his bat into the crowd

53:18.029 --> 53:18.863
and caused an accident

53:19.238 --> 53:21.032
So why let a gorilla play then?

53:21.616 --> 53:22.116
Don't you think?

53:25.077 --> 53:26.412
It's embarrassing

53:27.079 --> 53:28.331
Total circus

53:28.623 --> 53:30.875
KBO Decision "Mr. Go Restricted To Home Games"

53:31.125 --> 53:32.919
Doosan claims it was an accident

53:33.044 --> 53:35.880
while KBO voiced fear for the fans' safety

53:36.255 --> 53:37.715
and an emergency meeting

53:38.090 --> 53:39.884
was assembled with all 9 general managers

53:40.301 --> 53:41.886
to decide the fate of Mr. Go

53:42.220 --> 53:45.389
and restricting his remaining season
to home games only

53:48.684 --> 53:50.311
Get down! Please!

53:51.771 --> 53:53.940
Enough! Get down!

53:55.441 --> 53:57.610
Yes he'll come on the show

53:58.027 --> 53:58.945
Swap the order

53:59.195 --> 54:00.696
It tapes only once a week

54:01.030 --> 54:03.532
Idols are dime a dozen these days

54:06.953 --> 54:09.038
You'll get a rating

54:09.497 --> 54:10.873
as high as your blood pressure!

54:11.249 --> 54:12.083
That's all!

54:14.126 --> 54:15.044
Where the hell were you?

54:18.005 --> 54:20.424
Sir this contract

54:20.800 --> 54:22.718
something's wrong

54:23.511 --> 54:24.178
Go away!

54:29.850 --> 54:30.977
Who told you to act out?

54:31.310 --> 54:31.894
Lie down!

54:39.360 --> 54:39.986
Sir

54:40.486 --> 54:41.654
My signature

54:42.446 --> 54:44.740
is not on this contract

54:45.574 --> 54:48.327
And where's the $300000 shown here?

54:48.619 --> 54:49.870
You read Korean well

54:50.246 --> 54:52.456
but only the parts you want to read

54:52.957 --> 54:54.041
It's written there

54:54.292 --> 54:56.711
30% of $300000 goes to the agent

54:57.169 --> 54:59.255
I don't have to tell you how I spend my money

54:59.547 --> 55:00.464
Stand up!

55:01.549 --> 55:02.800
But he eats $10000 worth of food

55:03.217 --> 55:04.677
a month understand?

55:05.469 --> 55:06.595
The rest of the money is yours

55:06.846 --> 55:08.264
when he completes the remaining games

55:08.597 --> 55:09.682
If he completes the season!

55:10.433 --> 55:11.600
But that's a pipe dream now

55:15.980 --> 55:17.440
Liar!

55:17.773 --> 55:18.733
Liar! Where's my $300000!

55:19.108 --> 55:20.568
Tell me! Where is it!

55:35.541 --> 55:36.625
No one got hurt!

55:36.959 --> 55:38.461
It was an accident!

55:38.878 --> 55:40.713
It wasn't what we wanted

55:41.130 --> 55:42.089
but it was his own doing

55:42.673 --> 55:43.966
I hope KBO stabilizes once again

55:44.258 --> 55:45.885
to what it was before

55:47.845 --> 55:49.847
Mr. Go is amazing

55:50.222 --> 55:51.307
Quite lovable too

55:51.682 --> 55:54.268
But he's still an animal

55:54.685 --> 55:55.644
Is this decision agreed by the committee?

55:56.103 --> 55:57.646
This is for the fans' safety

55:57.980 --> 55:59.607
it's the least penalizing outcome

56:04.111 --> 56:04.737
Let me through

56:09.575 --> 56:10.159
Don't follow me!

56:12.203 --> 56:13.829
This is all your fault! Go away!

56:15.873 --> 56:18.209
In the light of Mr. Go's rampage today

56:18.584 --> 56:22.004
KBO will not retract its decision

56:22.505 --> 56:23.964
despite Doosan's appeal

56:24.215 --> 56:26.175
and is considering the possibility

56:26.509 --> 56:27.593
of a damage claim suit

56:27.885 --> 56:29.804
KBO will also request Mr. Go's evaluation

56:30.137 --> 56:32.223
in order to prevent

56:32.473 --> 56:34.767
a future relapse of the incident

56:35.017 --> 56:36.811
that took place today

57:20.062 --> 57:20.771
It's all right

57:22.314 --> 57:23.065
Bring it

57:24.358 --> 57:25.401
Bring everything

57:28.529 --> 57:29.738
Let's have a feast

57:38.038 --> 57:39.039
I'm so drunk

57:40.416 --> 57:41.834
Cheers

57:47.548 --> 57:49.175
You sure know how to drink

57:53.721 --> 57:55.890
Our Ling Ling is devouring a $3000

57:56.265 --> 57:58.434
Fox Brush Orchid

58:00.436 --> 58:01.437
Cheers

58:08.527 --> 58:11.113
They call me the bounty hunter

58:11.489 --> 58:12.990
who hunts men

58:14.158 --> 58:16.118
Because I sold them all

58:16.368 --> 58:17.703
to USA and Japan

58:20.581 --> 58:23.042
But you're the first one I took in

58:30.716 --> 58:31.550
For me?

58:34.678 --> 58:36.096
No not this

58:36.680 --> 58:39.099
This is a $8000 wild plant from Hanra Mountain

58:40.434 --> 58:41.143
Don't eat it!

58:44.563 --> 58:46.232
You're looking after me?

58:47.066 --> 58:49.151
That's why I like you

58:49.944 --> 58:51.153
Humans complain

58:51.487 --> 58:52.363
no matter how well you treat them

58:52.738 --> 58:57.326
Never grateful for anything

58:58.786 --> 58:59.703
Dammit

59:01.080 --> 59:02.790
$1 million right?

59:03.958 --> 59:05.709
I have a plan

59:06.293 --> 59:07.670
Commercials! Mass appeal!

59:07.920 --> 59:09.088
To prove you're a safe animal!

59:09.380 --> 59:11.757
It's all within my grasp okay?

59:12.383 --> 59:14.718
So don't worry

59:15.511 --> 59:16.303
and drink!

59:16.554 --> 59:17.429
I told you!

59:18.847 --> 59:19.932
Not this one

59:23.519 --> 59:24.937
No more munchies

59:28.190 --> 59:30.109
You pig

59:30.442 --> 59:31.569
You'll damage your liver

59:31.860 --> 59:33.404
I noticed you have fatty liver

59:33.779 --> 59:35.698
in the med exam report

59:36.574 --> 59:38.867
This is good for the liver

59:39.994 --> 59:42.204
Open wide

59:42.788 --> 59:45.249
That's it open wide

59:48.210 --> 59:49.044
How is it?

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:37.343
The next news is about

01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:42.431
Korean baseball's gorilla incident in
Doosan stadium yesterday afternoon

01:00:42.723 --> 01:00:49.104
KBO called an emergency meeting,

01:00:49.647 --> 01:00:53.233
and restricted Mr. Go to home games

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.527
Having forfeited the game
and their power hitter penalized,

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.613
Doosan will not pay the full incentive

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:06.372
that was agreed upon in the contract.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:12.836
"Many fans are baffled
by the unexecpted incident,

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:16.465
and questions the safety of the animal.

01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:19.843
From China's national hero
to a dangerous animal...

01:01:43.826 --> 01:01:44.827
Come quick!

01:01:45.244 --> 01:01:46.537
He went into Leiting's cage!

01:01:47.955 --> 01:01:48.664
Hurry!

01:01:53.127 --> 01:01:55.003
I know exactly what you want

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:58.173
It was painful to keep it in wasn't it?

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:08.392
From now on

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:15.774
you're free

01:02:35.711 --> 01:02:36.587
Sir

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:39.465
Sir!

01:02:41.967 --> 01:02:44.052
Is this appropriate?

01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:49.641
Yeah just do what I tell you

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:51.393
From today

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:54.813
he'll be known as a safe...

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:16.919
Ling Ling!

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:20.047
That's it! That does it!

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:24.176
You're my new rug on my floor!

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:26.345
How dare you ruin my tree!

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:30.307
Why did you let him drink?

01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:31.850
Serves you right

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:35.813
Idiot

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:50.118
Welcome back to 'Lemon Tree'

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:52.871
Our next guest is

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.665
a real special... someone?

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.167
Pardon me

01:03:57.417 --> 01:03:59.378
He really is a VIP

01:04:00.087 --> 01:04:02.464
You might be afraid of him

01:04:05.217 --> 01:04:06.176
You're not?

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:07.594
No!

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.722
Let's welcome Doosan Bears' Mr. Go

01:04:10.931 --> 01:04:13.392
and Weiwei! A big round of applause!

01:04:22.234 --> 01:04:23.402
He's wearing a Hanbok

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:34.913
Show them

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.749
You see! He's tame!

01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:12.362
Of course!

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:18.827
He'll do commercials! Yes! Everything!

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:20.704
It's simple

01:07:21.038 --> 01:07:23.582
Just run like this you see?

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:25.542
He can't

01:07:27.169 --> 01:07:27.919
Like this

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.171
Like this?

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:31.214
Yeah that's it

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:32.466
Ms. Zhao

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:34.843
How much does Mr. Go weigh?

01:07:36.094 --> 01:07:37.304
He weighs 300 kg

01:07:37.846 --> 01:07:39.264
300kg? He looks so fit!

01:07:39.681 --> 01:07:41.224
Our treadmill will hold

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.811
even Mr. Go's massive frame and weight...

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.237
Mr. Go is not running

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:56.156
he's going after his dreams...

01:07:56.323 --> 01:07:56.948
Ling Ling get up!

01:08:55.423 --> 01:09:00.011
The next news is about
Ling Ling's baseball sensation in China

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.223
He won a game for Doosan again

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.725
The team entered the postseason game
without a hitch

01:09:06.393 --> 01:09:09.479
Since his arrival in July

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:12.357
This outsider has hit

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:15.819
37 home runs in total

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:16.611
Ready! Throw!

01:09:16.862 --> 01:09:19.156
Leiting! Show me what you got!

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:24.161
Very good! Very good!

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:28.038
Let's stick it up to the world that shunned us!

01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:31.251
Ling Ling boosted Doosan Bears's confidence

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.295
He becames the kingpin

01:09:33.545 --> 01:09:36.631
and is believed to win
the postseason game for the team

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:39.301
whole world is watching today

01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:41.011
Sung Choong-su!

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:46.765
Big news!

01:09:48.185 --> 01:09:48.977
Take a look at these

01:09:51.354 --> 01:09:52.022
What are these?

01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:54.149
I told you to shred them

01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:57.027
We can't have any evidence lying around

01:09:57.652 --> 01:09:59.362
They sent these again

01:09:59.613 --> 01:10:01.489
Chunichi and Yomiuri owners
will come at the same time

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:07.829
I did what you told me to do

01:10:08.163 --> 01:10:09.080
We hooked them good

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:12.459
Division Finals Game 1 Doosan Home Games

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:13.543
This is the first postseason game!

01:10:13.919 --> 01:10:15.253
Bottom of the 8th
Tied at 31 out Bases full

01:10:15.587 --> 01:10:17.130
and pinch hitter Mr. Go is coming out!

01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:19.507
NC can't wriggle their way out of this one

01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:22.761
Can they afford to give up 4 runs?

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:24.804
It's NC's fault

01:10:25.305 --> 01:10:28.141
They allowed 3 hits
and now all the bases are loaded

01:10:28.516 --> 01:10:30.727
4 runs in the 8th will seal the game!

01:10:31.228 --> 01:10:32.395
NC's Moon

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:35.649
He's holding the ball

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:36.942
They're using the 12-second rule

01:10:37.484 --> 01:10:38.193
It's an ingenious plan

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:41.321
When the umpire calls play

01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:44.241
the pitcher has 12 seconds to throw
or it's a ball

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:45.450
He'll allow a walk

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.118
and give Doosan a free run

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:49.913
The umpire calls the 1st ball

01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:54.125
Rather than give up 4 runs they'll eat a run

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.126
Yes they're confident

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.461
they can catch up by the 9th

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.380
4 runs now will end the game right here

01:10:58.964 --> 01:11:00.048
Done deal

01:11:00.632 --> 01:11:03.510
Doosan fans are tossing bananas
and telling him to lie down

01:11:05.011 --> 01:11:06.304
Ling Ling lie down!

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:13.103
Weiwei signals Mr. Go to lie down on the ground

01:11:13.687 --> 01:11:14.688
What a dull play

01:11:15.188 --> 01:11:17.649
Mr. Go must be bored just waiting

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.443
What did the commissioner say?

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:23.321
He's happy

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.365
He wants 30% of the deal

01:11:25.532 --> 01:11:28.201
for the league development fund

01:11:28.535 --> 01:11:30.662
He'll even adjust trade rules

01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:32.414
Of course he will

01:11:32.664 --> 01:11:33.707
getting rid of an eye sore

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:35.709
and pocket some of that money too

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:38.461
Does the GM know?

01:11:39.254 --> 01:11:40.171
Did you mention anything?

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:42.007
You said not to

01:11:42.215 --> 01:11:43.216
I told him nothing

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:50.223
We're all finished if this leaks
before the deal

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:53.893
The league and me too

01:11:58.565 --> 01:11:59.691
Owner of Chunichi Dragons Ito Hiroshi

01:12:00.066 --> 01:12:01.609
has arrived in Korea

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.154
The purpose of his visit is still unknown

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:07.866
It's very rare for the Japanese club owner
to fly in

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:12.287
some critics are saying
he's here to acquire Mr. Go

01:12:12.579 --> 01:12:15.915
Mr. Hiroshi refused to comment
on his visit at the airport

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:19.878
Adding more mystery

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:23.089
Mr. Go's walk brings home a runner

01:12:23.465 --> 01:12:25.091
and Doosan takes the lead

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.222
Mr. Hiroshi one moment please!

01:12:32.223 --> 01:12:33.850
Game 2 of Division Finals

01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:35.977
Bottom of the 9th Doosan at bat

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:37.729
Game 2 Doosan Home Game

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:40.023
Doosan runners on 1st and 2nd

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:42.192
Can they fill up the bases?

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:44.152
NC must strike them out

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:46.321
or else they will face Mr. Go on full bases

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:47.572
Here's the 5th pitch

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:51.618
Ahn swings and it flies
just above the pitcher's head!

01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:54.371
The shortstop slide catches
and throws it to 1st!

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:56.247
Safe! He makes it!

01:12:56.706 --> 01:12:58.166
Bottom of the 9th with bases loaded

01:12:58.458 --> 01:12:59.918
and <i>2</i> outs for Doosan!

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:01.378
The stage is ripe for Mr. Go isn't it?

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:02.879
It sure is

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:07.675
Hear that music?

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:11.304
A grave situation for the NC players

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:12.430
and their fans too!

01:13:13.807 --> 01:13:17.644
<i>2</i> million yen transfer fee

01:13:18.061 --> 01:13:19.312
and 1 million annual salary

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:20.647
That's our offer

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.441
That translates to a $30 million transfer fee

01:13:23.817 --> 01:13:25.527
and $15 million annual salary

01:13:26.361 --> 01:13:29.864
It's the highest offer
in Chunichi club's history

01:13:32.367 --> 01:13:32.784
Choong-su?

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:34.160
Pardon me

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:35.829
Excuse me

01:13:36.538 --> 01:13:39.666
Allow me please

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:42.252
Volume up

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.715
Kim must work up the courage and see it through

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.528
Game-ending grand slam!

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:09.696
Doosan takes the game with a climatic hit!

01:14:09.904 --> 01:14:12.449
Can you put a price on this?

01:14:14.576 --> 01:14:15.827
Let's see that in slow motion

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.789
That's a perfect hit! Utterly perfect!

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:22.876
With tremendous power Mr. Go hits a grand slam

01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:25.628
and wins Game 2 for Doosan!

01:14:28.381 --> 01:14:29.215
Even my circus?

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:30.383
Yes

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:31.593
And the debt too?

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:33.136
It's $100 million!

01:14:35.847 --> 01:14:37.098
Awesome! I have to let Sunny
and the others know!

01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:39.559
You're the best Mr. Sung!

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.227
So when do we sign?

01:14:42.103 --> 01:14:42.770
We don't

01:14:43.438 --> 01:14:44.105
I got a debt to pay

01:14:45.023 --> 01:14:45.940
and open Circus of the Sun with it

01:14:48.359 --> 01:14:49.235
You little brat

01:14:49.861 --> 01:14:51.488
Got to start a bidding war with Yomiuri

01:14:51.863 --> 01:14:53.114
They're rivals

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:55.617
We need to turn up the heat

01:14:56.618 --> 01:14:58.536
Why do we have to do that?

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:02.081
So he'll be worth more!

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:03.249
You daft girl!

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:05.293
They'll outbid each other

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.969
You don't get many chances in life

01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:16.304
It's easy to miss them

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:17.931
completely

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:28.942
You train him to do weird stuff

01:15:43.957 --> 01:15:45.333
Next up on our program

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.835
It's the talk of the town

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:50.046
Doosan won <i>2</i> straight

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:52.966
Division Finals games against NC

01:15:53.341 --> 01:15:55.093
Let's see the highlights

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:58.179
Mr. Go's extra run during game 1

01:15:58.596 --> 01:15:59.681
and his grand slam at today's game

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:02.350
led to Doosan's victories

01:16:02.684 --> 01:16:05.019
NC GM Jang Woo-won openly expressed

01:16:05.395 --> 01:16:07.981
his frustration during the game

01:16:08.356 --> 01:16:10.984
A scuffle between NC's pitcher Kim Hyun-sung

01:16:11.359 --> 01:16:13.945
and catcher Kim Jae-wook at the end of the game

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:17.115
became a much talked about topic

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:21.953
Perhaps the grand slam was too much to swallow

01:16:22.287 --> 01:16:23.663
Their teammates stepped in

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:27.458
but even they couldn't hold them back

01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:30.169
The coach and his staff could only watch

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:33.256
Sir

01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:47.228
You asked me how deep my love is

01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:50.315
Are you all right?

01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:53.610
Did you order take-out?

01:16:55.278 --> 01:16:55.903
No we didn't

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:18.885
It's gotten much worse

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.722
His cruciate ligament is about to sever

01:17:23.014 --> 01:17:24.432
But what's the treatment?

01:17:24.766 --> 01:17:25.850
I don't care about diagnosis

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:28.019
What's the treatment?

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:30.813
Knee surgery right away

01:17:31.773 --> 01:17:32.357
What?

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.108
Then at least 6 weeks in a cast

01:17:34.942 --> 01:17:35.568
6 weeks?

01:17:36.653 --> 01:17:38.321
Ever been bitten by a gorilla?

01:17:40.615 --> 01:17:42.450
Weiwei order him!

01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:43.451
Attack

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:46.204
Please don't!

01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:48.748
Stop

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:52.251
When do you need him?

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:53.711
Game 3 tomorrow

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:55.213
Tomorrow you got that?

01:17:58.049 --> 01:17:58.633
Just bite me

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:00.510
Don't move

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:01.678
Are you nuts?

01:18:02.679 --> 01:18:04.097
Let's observe for a few days

01:18:04.389 --> 01:18:05.640
with morphine and a leg brace

01:18:06.516 --> 01:18:07.975
You already won <i>2</i> games

01:18:08.393 --> 01:18:09.352
even if you lose the 3rd and 4th

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:10.812
you still got the 5th

01:18:11.396 --> 01:18:12.939
Let's give him time to heal okay?

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.860
He's here

01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:22.699
With the arrival of two Japanese club owners

01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:25.576
not divulging their purpose of visit

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:27.745
baseball fans are rampant with speculation

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:31.958
Due to construction at NC's stadium
all games will be played at Jamsil

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:33.292
Game 3 NC Home Game

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:35.044
Game 3 of the Division Finals!

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:38.840
Top of the 9th 1 out Bases loaded for Doosan

01:18:39.215 --> 01:18:41.634
It bounces off the pitcher's foot!

01:18:42.009 --> 01:18:43.302
2nd base to 1st! He's out!

01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:45.096
Kim is out at 1st with this double play

01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:46.472
The game comes to an end

01:18:46.806 --> 01:18:48.558
Doosan just didn't have it today

01:18:48.975 --> 01:18:49.976
Their fans won't take it lightly

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:52.603
Mr. Go should've came out to finish the game

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:55.773
Mr. Go was absent for unknown reasons

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:59.777
Doosan fans are protesting

01:19:00.611 --> 01:19:01.404
Sung... pick up

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:06.033
Come on

01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:11.414
Here? Is he here?

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:13.499
Doosan GM's going crazy looking for you

01:19:13.875 --> 01:19:15.334
Are you nuts? You can't just remove
a player off the roster

01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:16.252
Let's chat later

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:20.882
I understand fully

01:19:21.174 --> 01:19:21.966
Let's go inside

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:23.885
It's a done deal

01:19:24.552 --> 01:19:25.720
He agreed to double

01:19:26.012 --> 01:19:27.305
Chunichi's bid

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:30.183
Both transfer fee and salary

01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:35.730
He wants to sign it tomorrow

01:19:39.192 --> 01:19:40.193
Thank you so much

01:19:40.735 --> 01:19:43.488
We'd like to conduct a medical exam

01:19:45.281 --> 01:19:47.784
Medical... exam?

01:19:48.493 --> 01:19:51.662
This is our team doctor Tetsuo

01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:54.540
Allow him to conduct the exam

01:19:54.916 --> 01:19:57.794
and send me the results before I leave

01:19:58.920 --> 01:19:59.796
Doctor? I see

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:04.258
I expect you won't negotiate any further
with Chunichi

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.687
I never even got to treat my mother's arthritis

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:20.983
but here I am stuck in a vet hospital storage

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:22.610
fixing a gorilla's knee

01:20:22.944 --> 01:20:24.153
Not even a normal pet either

01:20:24.946 --> 01:20:26.948
I didn't spend 10 years in med school for this

01:20:28.533 --> 01:20:30.535
Please get UP!

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:43.756
He wants to play

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:52.390
Don't move! Ling Ling!

01:20:56.686 --> 01:20:57.937
I've had it!

01:20:58.312 --> 01:20:59.564
He's not really hurt

01:21:01.399 --> 01:21:02.525
He's just mad at me

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:07.196
Will you snap out of it if he loses the leg?

01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:11.367
Who's losing the leg?

01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:14.245
Who?

01:21:14.954 --> 01:21:15.955
Ling Ling!

01:21:16.414 --> 01:21:17.331
Everyone out!

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:20.501
I can't concentrate on this simple procedure!

01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:23.379
It won't happen!

01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:24.881
He won't lose his leg!

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:26.757
He's not losing his leg!

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:31.304
Weiwei! Where are you going?

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:34.473
That little brat

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:35.766
Shut up!

01:21:42.565 --> 01:21:44.400
Chunichi Dragons and Yomiuri Giants

01:21:44.817 --> 01:21:46.485
The biggest rivals in Japanese baseball

01:21:46.944 --> 01:21:49.196
Both club owners arrived at the same time

01:21:49.614 --> 01:21:51.991
but their reason for visit is still a mystery

01:21:52.617 --> 01:21:54.076
You got nowhere else to go

01:22:00.333 --> 01:22:02.627
Just look at your glum face

01:22:06.172 --> 01:22:07.298
Get up

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:13.262
It's not polite to kick a person

01:22:14.347 --> 01:22:17.183
I said get up! Don't make me angry!

01:22:24.941 --> 01:22:26.400
You're a liar!

01:22:26.734 --> 01:22:28.027
You hid Ling Ling's injury!

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:31.572
Got a weapon?

01:22:33.366 --> 01:22:35.826
You're not the only one! I got one...

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:39.747
Where's my gun?

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:44.502
I'm a liar?

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:48.339
You can supposedly talk to him

01:22:49.006 --> 01:22:50.508
How did you not know

01:22:50.925 --> 01:22:51.801
he was in pain?

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:53.552
Be honest now

01:22:53.928 --> 01:22:55.054
You're the liar aren't you?

01:22:56.806 --> 01:22:57.723
I think

01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.266
you know him the least!

01:23:00.393 --> 01:23:02.937
Always that whu-whu-whu nonsense!

01:23:05.982 --> 01:23:07.108
I know my Ling Ling!

01:23:08.067 --> 01:23:10.277
I fed him and raised him! I'm his master!

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:11.529
Of course I understand him!

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:14.156
I know everything he's saying!

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:23.958
This is Leiting from China

01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:25.751
NC has acquired a pitching gorilla

01:23:26.127 --> 01:23:27.670
known as Zeros

01:23:28.004 --> 01:23:29.714
Let's take a look at his arrival

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:37.763
NC Dinos Signs Chinese Gorilla Zeros

01:23:40.725 --> 01:23:44.145
Why can't NC acquire a gorilla too?

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.064
Will you put him in the game today?

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:48.858
Is it so weird to see a team's pitcher

01:23:49.817 --> 01:23:50.693
doing what he does best?

01:23:51.027 --> 01:23:53.070
Will Zeros really play in today's game?

01:23:53.404 --> 01:23:55.322
It's very likely that he will

01:23:55.573 --> 01:23:58.242
Not Leiting... he's too dangerous

01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:03.039
Game 4 NC Home Game

01:24:04.457 --> 01:24:05.791
Game 4 of the Division Finals

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:07.918
Top of 9th <i>2</i> outs Runners on 1st and 2nd

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:09.503
After losing the 3rd game

01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:10.796
Doosan is facing another loss

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:12.965
Kim is gesturing for a bunt

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:16.761
Fake bunt to a full swing! It's a hit!

01:24:17.428 --> 01:24:19.472
Is this one final whimper for Doosan?

01:24:20.139 --> 01:24:22.391
Mr. Go won't come out today either?

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.770
He has to! It's game 4

01:24:26.145 --> 01:24:28.105
There's no reason to keep him out is there?

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:32.026
Is Yomiuri being rather particular?

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:36.655
We'll cut yesterday's figure by half

01:24:37.448 --> 01:24:40.034
We'll meet all of your terms

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.662
He is worthy of our agreement

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.086
How about medical test in Japan next spring?

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:54.632
Since elementary school

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:58.344
I've cut my hair from the same barber

01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:00.429
For over 30 years now

01:25:02.807 --> 01:25:03.516
Amazing

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:06.519
It means that I'm a man of trust

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:11.816
I grant you my trust

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:17.488
Thank you very much!

01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:21.867
Why are you still standing? Get the contract!

01:25:22.243 --> 01:25:23.119
Bring it!

01:25:23.619 --> 01:25:24.662
Hurry!

01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:25.871
Get it!

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:28.833
No one has ever seen any pitching
like this before

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:30.626
Here's the replay in slow motion

01:25:31.877 --> 01:25:34.213
This is a first for me too

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:36.090
Where else can you see that?

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:49.562
Where would you like to sign?

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:53.023
Whose gorilla is that?

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.151
What kind of player is Zeros?

01:25:55.734 --> 01:25:58.863
His real name is Leiting meaning 'thunder'

01:25:59.405 --> 01:26:03.075
He's a mountain gorilla unlike Mr. Go
who everybody is familiar with

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:04.702
He's known to be an aggressive kind

01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:06.996
It's a strike! Another strike!

01:26:07.872 --> 01:26:08.747
Brutal!

01:26:09.123 --> 01:26:11.750
His pitch is practically an assault!

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:16.422
An incredible relief pitcher
has raised NC up from the dead

01:26:17.047 --> 01:26:21.051
Now Doosan's series win
is not so surefire anymore

01:26:21.468 --> 01:26:23.387
What a perfect timing

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:52.750
Where did you hide my gorilla?

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:59.465
I brought you back from the dead to become GM

01:27:00.007 --> 01:27:01.634
and now you want to slap me around?

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.470
How dare you?

01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:08.682
You want to die too right?

01:27:08.933 --> 01:27:10.893
Get out of my car!

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:21.278
Tomorrow's the final game!

01:27:22.613 --> 01:27:23.656
For your sake

01:27:24.365 --> 01:27:26.242
and that girl too

01:27:27.117 --> 01:27:29.078
I hope it isn't your final day as well

01:27:30.829 --> 01:27:31.497
Drive

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:46.929
We've arrived at NC's and Doosan's

01:27:47.263 --> 01:27:48.639
Game 5 Jamsil Stadium

01:27:48.889 --> 01:27:50.808
Division Finals Game 5

01:27:51.267 --> 01:27:53.811
We're about to begin at Jamsil Stadium

01:27:54.103 --> 01:27:55.187
Today's game will determine everything

01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:57.147
Mr. Go's appearance will be

01:27:57.481 --> 01:27:58.691
the decisive factor

01:27:59.108 --> 01:27:59.775
And as you saw yesterday

01:28:00.109 --> 01:28:02.236
Zeros will also contribute heavily

01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:03.570
to today's outcome

01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:04.822
Weiwei hurry up!

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:06.949
Get ready!

01:28:12.121 --> 01:28:13.789
How did you train the gorilla?

01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:21.255
With love and concern!

01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:28.095
Humans lack these qualities

01:28:28.721 --> 01:28:30.514
that's why they make irrational decisions

01:28:38.314 --> 01:28:41.483
You think he's angry? No

01:28:42.401 --> 01:28:46.071
He's just hot because he grew up
in the mountains

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:49.033
He's not used to the lowland

01:28:50.159 --> 01:28:51.535
so he gets hot easily

01:28:51.952 --> 01:28:53.495
He grunts a lot to cool himself

01:28:54.163 --> 01:28:54.997
He's not angry

01:28:55.247 --> 01:28:55.914
Weiwei!

01:28:56.332 --> 01:28:57.541
We got to go!

01:29:00.419 --> 01:29:00.961
Weiwei!

01:29:01.128 --> 01:29:03.005
Weiwei! Listen carefully

01:29:04.631 --> 01:29:05.382
This is a painkiller

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:08.385
It's morphine-based so give him 20cc
when in pain

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.514
Can't tell if that's enough for that thing

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.808
Anyway only as a last resort

01:29:15.601 --> 01:29:18.354
If you give him too much it'll tranquilize him

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:19.938
Got that?

01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:22.691
Got it! Only as a last resort

01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:24.735
But if he doesn't get up

01:29:25.069 --> 01:29:26.236
like you said he would

01:29:27.196 --> 01:29:28.405
If he doesn't walk

01:29:29.114 --> 01:29:30.407
then you won't too

01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:33.410
Kiss your legs goodbye you hear me?

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:36.455
You hear me?

01:29:41.377 --> 01:29:42.086
Take this

01:29:44.588 --> 01:29:45.964
My baby!

01:29:49.009 --> 01:29:52.805
Isn't he something?

01:29:53.138 --> 01:29:57.351
He understood that gorilla perfectly

01:29:58.060 --> 01:30:02.064
Love and concern according to his agent

01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:05.692
Top of the 5th with 1 out and tied at 3

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:07.319
A scoring opportunity for NC

01:30:07.611 --> 01:30:09.405
They must bring home the runner on 2nd

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:18.789
That's Chunichi's Ito

01:30:19.039 --> 01:30:21.125
with Zeros' agent together

01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:23.252
As we speculated they're negotiating for Zeros

01:30:23.544 --> 01:30:25.045
So that means

01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:26.672
Ito's purpose of visit is to acquire Zeros

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:29.133
We got to stop them! Are you asleep?

01:30:29.633 --> 01:30:31.718
Sleeping again!

01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:33.387
Powerful gorilla my ass!

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:35.722
More like a senior citizen

01:30:38.392 --> 01:30:40.686
You should be in your prime

01:30:40.978 --> 01:30:43.021
But then again you're 70 in human age

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:44.898
People at that age

01:30:45.190 --> 01:30:47.818
eat out of a straw and use diapers

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:50.988
But why now?

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:53.657
Just once more at bat Ling Ling!

01:30:54.074 --> 01:30:57.202
I don't need a home run! Just stand there!

01:30:57.744 --> 01:30:59.913
Keep your leg up and lie down

01:31:00.164 --> 01:31:01.623
Lie down and stay still

01:31:10.632 --> 01:31:12.593
I'll be back after I stop the signing

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:13.469
Mr. Sung

01:31:13.886 --> 01:31:14.595
Yeah?

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:17.598
Ling Ling's asleep

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:19.808
It's the painkiller so wake him up

01:31:21.268 --> 01:31:21.935
Wake him up!

01:31:23.103 --> 01:31:23.854
Sir

01:31:24.771 --> 01:31:25.564
What now?

01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:28.984
When I

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:31.904
speak to Ling Ling

01:31:33.113 --> 01:31:35.782
I don't understand him

01:31:36.116 --> 01:31:37.242
just like you said

01:31:38.952 --> 01:31:42.080
I only grunt at him

01:31:43.248 --> 01:31:46.418
because people liked it when I did that

01:31:46.877 --> 01:31:48.712
so I kept doing it

01:31:49.630 --> 01:31:54.760
I... don't understand him at all

01:31:56.887 --> 01:31:58.597
You were right about everything

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:01.892
You figured it all out

01:32:13.904 --> 01:32:14.571
It's okay

01:32:15.989 --> 01:32:17.491
Because he understands you

01:32:18.116 --> 01:32:18.784
He really does

01:32:28.794 --> 01:32:31.880
Bottom of the 7th Runner on 2nd No outs

01:32:32.214 --> 01:32:34.299
Doosan can come back from this!

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.804
He hits! To the right field!

01:32:39.054 --> 01:32:41.223
Runner on 2nd runs past 3rd base!

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:43.225
The right fielder picks it up!

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.434
There's no time!

01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:46.395
The right fielder throws home!

01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:47.854
Head-to-head at home!

01:32:48.438 --> 01:32:50.440
He's tagged out!

01:32:50.649 --> 01:32:52.192
Now to the 2nd base! Another out!

01:32:52.442 --> 01:32:54.403
Instant double play!

01:32:54.861 --> 01:32:56.655
Nothing's going right for Doosan

01:32:56.989 --> 01:32:59.199
They blew a silver lining!

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:00.617
This is bleak

01:33:00.951 --> 01:33:02.911
Tension led to a ludicrous play

01:33:03.328 --> 01:33:04.621
The players know that too

01:33:04.955 --> 01:33:06.707
They need a big hit

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:08.250
Doosan's on their last leg

01:33:08.584 --> 01:33:12.004
They need Mr. Go now more than ever

01:33:12.337 --> 01:33:14.381
I don't understand at all

01:33:14.881 --> 01:33:16.925
This is the time for Mr. Go

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:20.929
Mr. Ito! Mr. Ito!

01:33:22.097 --> 01:33:23.265
Mr. Ito!

01:33:24.266 --> 01:33:26.226
He hasn't signed Zeros yet

01:33:26.476 --> 01:33:27.436
Mr. Ito!

01:33:28.979 --> 01:33:29.605
Mr...

01:33:31.315 --> 01:33:32.149
This is like a summit

01:33:32.566 --> 01:33:33.609
between three countries

01:33:35.277 --> 01:33:36.945
Why bother calling me at all?

01:33:37.279 --> 01:33:37.946
I told you

01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:40.157
it's all over once Zeros is signed

01:33:40.532 --> 01:33:41.617
Didn't I tell you to stay alert

01:33:41.867 --> 01:33:42.784
and watch them closely?

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:43.744
Move aside

01:33:44.828 --> 01:33:45.370
What?

01:33:45.746 --> 01:33:46.538
Move!

01:33:54.546 --> 01:33:55.255
Move!

01:34:01.053 --> 01:34:03.639
Choong-su hold on!

01:34:12.939 --> 01:34:13.690
Mr. Ito!

01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:17.235
Mr. Ito! Mr. Ito!

01:34:18.195 --> 01:34:19.696
Mr. Go is going to play!

01:34:20.197 --> 01:34:23.241
You mustn't sign right now

01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:25.410
Please wait a little longer

01:34:25.952 --> 01:34:28.538
Just listen to our new terms

01:34:29.665 --> 01:34:30.624
Mr. Ito!

01:34:31.375 --> 01:34:35.796
Zeros is a vicious gorilla!

01:34:37.089 --> 01:34:37.881
Mr. Ito!

01:34:38.632 --> 01:34:39.841
Please open this door

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:41.968
I'm done with you

01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:42.969
Ito!

01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:51.645
You stupid fool! You stupid!

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:54.606
That's a 30-year old hair style?

01:34:54.981 --> 01:34:55.982
You look like an idiot!

01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.402
We call that bucket style!

01:34:58.777 --> 01:34:59.653
You hear me?

01:34:59.986 --> 01:35:01.321
Ito is a pervert!

01:35:01.613 --> 01:35:05.534
Ito you stupid!

01:35:06.702 --> 01:35:07.285
What?

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:08.995
You scum!

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:10.163
Sung Choong-su!

01:35:18.213 --> 01:35:21.425
How dare he use the word 'pervert'?

01:35:27.222 --> 01:35:29.558
No more games until next season for the loser

01:35:29.933 --> 01:35:30.809
They must not hold back

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:32.769
Swinging at 1st pitch!

01:35:33.353 --> 01:35:34.521
To the outfield!

01:35:37.399 --> 01:35:39.693
Diving catch! He caught the ball!

01:35:40.152 --> 01:35:42.404
Fierce competitiveness from both teams!

01:35:42.821 --> 01:35:43.739
Very good! It's the war of nerves!

01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:45.699
The game's heating up!

01:36:29.868 --> 01:36:30.494
Mr. Secretary

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.579
Why did he call for us?

01:36:36.583 --> 01:36:39.211
Choong-su this is our last chance

01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:41.171
We got to sell them all

01:36:42.172 --> 01:36:44.382
Mr. Secretary will take care
of any legal issues

01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:46.092
that come up

01:36:48.595 --> 01:36:49.596
Huh? What kind?

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.057
As NC's offense continues

01:36:52.599 --> 01:36:54.392
Zeros warms up in the bullpen

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:56.478
He's got a very aggressive temper

01:36:56.686 --> 01:36:57.646
Her grandfather said

01:36:58.146 --> 01:37:00.148
a child is a blessing

01:37:00.357 --> 01:37:01.316
Exclusive "Humanity's Best Friend"

01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:02.859
Rerun : Winner of the 32nd Asian
Documentary Festival

01:37:03.151 --> 01:37:05.487
No one knows who Weiwei's parents are

01:37:06.279 --> 01:37:10.408
and no one knows where Ling Ling came from

01:37:11.743 --> 01:37:16.206
Having traveled halfway around the world

01:37:16.915 --> 01:37:18.917
gorilla Ling Ling and baby Weiwei

01:37:19.376 --> 01:37:24.339
became a family

01:37:25.131 --> 01:37:29.928
just like how all the children of Ronghua
became family

01:37:30.136 --> 01:37:31.596
Runner on 3rd comes in! Safe!

01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:34.558
Kim Taek-gyun throws home!

01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:35.642
To the catcher!

01:37:35.892 --> 01:37:37.018
Too fast! He avoids being tagged!

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:38.395
Safe! It's safe!

01:37:53.034 --> 01:37:57.247
Zeros is still warming up
in the bullpen standing by

01:37:57.622 --> 01:37:59.040
If I made you upset

01:37:59.332 --> 01:38:02.419
by requesting a medical exam

01:38:03.962 --> 01:38:06.756
I apologize profusely

01:38:18.226 --> 01:38:19.769
Losing to Chunichi

01:38:20.145 --> 01:38:21.813
is an unbearable insult

01:38:22.272 --> 01:38:23.315
Please defeat Zeros

01:38:23.815 --> 01:38:26.568
in this final game

01:38:27.193 --> 01:38:28.820
If you can make that happen

01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:31.740
I'll accept all your terms

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:36.995
This is a blank check

01:38:37.662 --> 01:38:40.165
Write whatever amount

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:41.416
you deem worthy

01:38:52.052 --> 01:38:52.886
Come in

01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:54.387
Take the check

01:39:11.363 --> 01:39:13.531
Kim Do-su's clean hit to the left field!

01:39:13.865 --> 01:39:15.116
A miracle in the bottom of the 9th

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:17.202
with no outs and bases loaded for Doosan

01:39:17.577 --> 01:39:18.703
There's still hope for Doosan!

01:39:18.995 --> 01:39:20.163
They got no outs yet

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:23.959
But here comes Zeros!

01:39:25.043 --> 01:39:26.503
Letting his presence known!

01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:30.548
NC's special relief pitcher
is approaching the mound!

01:39:54.531 --> 01:39:56.449
You hid this from us?

01:39:57.033 --> 01:39:58.994
This is low even for you

01:40:06.668 --> 01:40:08.461
He wasn't this serious before

01:40:08.753 --> 01:40:10.171
Why did you make that call?

01:40:11.548 --> 01:40:12.757
Who gave you the right

01:40:13.133 --> 01:40:14.592
to hide this from me?

01:40:14.843 --> 01:40:16.177
Answer me!

01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:20.640
Drag him out

01:40:21.182 --> 01:40:22.475
and put him in the game

01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:25.145
Before you get sued

01:40:26.062 --> 01:40:27.814
On crutches?

01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:33.319
GM Kim! Calm down!

01:40:34.237 --> 01:40:36.865
Like a mirage that evaporated an oasis

01:40:37.574 --> 01:40:41.703
the earthquake swallowed the circus

01:40:43.329 --> 01:40:45.040
along with the ringmaster and Weiwei

01:40:46.249 --> 01:40:48.543
Time passes

01:40:49.919 --> 01:40:55.633
Exhausted circus children and rescue team

01:40:57.427 --> 01:40:58.511
I'll take full responsibility

01:40:59.429 --> 01:41:01.389
How? From behind bars?

01:41:02.098 --> 01:41:02.807
Call the cops

01:41:04.059 --> 01:41:06.519
This is fraud you hear me?!

01:41:06.978 --> 01:41:09.439
But gorilla Ling Ling was different

01:41:09.814 --> 01:41:13.860
He looked everywhere for his master Weiwei

01:41:14.736 --> 01:41:20.241
and he discovers the barely breathing Weiwei

01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:21.284
Sung Choong-su!

01:41:22.911 --> 01:41:23.620
Do you see that?

01:41:25.955 --> 01:41:27.040
Put that animal in the game

01:41:27.415 --> 01:41:29.042
before the cops get here

01:41:29.334 --> 01:41:30.168
Do you understand?

01:41:32.045 --> 01:41:36.341
Like a father protecting his child

01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:41.763
Weiwei is pulled out of the rubble miraculously

01:41:42.555 --> 01:41:45.809
Abandoned by the rescue team
and their equipment

01:41:46.768 --> 01:41:50.772
Weiwei escapes death with the help of an animal

01:41:56.778 --> 01:41:58.029
Get up Ling Ling!

01:42:02.742 --> 01:42:04.035
Ling Ling! Ling Ling!

01:42:04.285 --> 01:42:06.204
Get up right now!

01:42:06.871 --> 01:42:08.456
Get up please!

01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:11.334
You've never disappointed me before!

01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:12.877
Can you hear me?

01:42:13.253 --> 01:42:15.421
Get up Ling Ling!

01:42:15.964 --> 01:42:16.548
Ling Ling

01:42:24.514 --> 01:42:25.265
Get up!

01:42:33.815 --> 01:42:34.524
Ling Ling!

01:42:36.943 --> 01:42:38.278
You can do it!

01:42:40.446 --> 01:42:41.573
Get up!

01:42:43.741 --> 01:42:44.534
Wait!

01:42:47.245 --> 01:42:48.454
Save it for the police

01:43:11.603 --> 01:43:12.812
Ling Ling get up!

01:43:13.813 --> 01:43:15.940
The score is 6:3 with NC leading by 3

01:43:16.566 --> 01:43:21.321
Look how incredibly powerful his arm is

01:43:21.696 --> 01:43:23.531
Zeros is having fun on the ground

01:43:24.157 --> 01:43:25.283
He could care less about his teammates

01:43:25.992 --> 01:43:28.369
Change of plan Weiwei

01:43:34.751 --> 01:43:37.754
Take Ling Ling and go back to China

01:43:38.922 --> 01:43:40.423
Remember that doctor?

01:43:41.257 --> 01:43:43.927
He'll help you leave the country

01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:47.180
I'll get him to arrange your trip back

01:43:48.389 --> 01:43:49.766
You need $1 million right?

01:43:50.808 --> 01:43:51.893
Here is $1 million

01:43:52.477 --> 01:43:55.230
Pay back your debt with this

01:43:55.563 --> 01:43:56.731
and wait for me there

01:44:00.068 --> 01:44:00.777
I don't want to

01:44:10.245 --> 01:44:11.621
Remember what you said to me?

01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:14.123
Why do you like baseball?

01:44:14.749 --> 01:44:16.084
Home to home

01:44:16.376 --> 01:44:18.836
Baseball is a game where you start at home
and return home

01:44:19.212 --> 01:44:22.006
Now you two can return home

01:44:22.257 --> 01:44:23.007
What about you?

01:44:23.549 --> 01:44:24.300
Me?

01:44:25.635 --> 01:44:28.972
I'll make a short detour to jail

01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:30.431
One year should do

01:44:31.724 --> 01:44:33.017
I'll take care of everything

01:44:33.810 --> 01:44:35.228
and come visit you in China

01:44:35.728 --> 01:44:38.856
Until then run your circus

01:44:39.774 --> 01:44:42.235
Circus of the Sun

01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:43.861
run it and Wait for me

01:44:44.696 --> 01:44:46.572
Those people will try to hurt you!

01:44:51.286 --> 01:44:53.121
Don't cry for me

01:44:54.205 --> 01:44:58.918
What do people call me?

01:45:00.044 --> 01:45:00.920
Bounty hunter!

01:45:03.172 --> 01:45:04.465
That's right

01:45:04.924 --> 01:45:06.134
A human bounty hunter

01:45:08.094 --> 01:45:10.430
Ever seen a bounty hunter get hunted?

01:45:16.102 --> 01:45:16.811
Yeah

01:45:38.458 --> 01:45:40.084
Look! Will there be a substitution?

01:45:40.418 --> 01:45:41.669
Coach Kim is on the field

01:45:43.338 --> 01:45:44.047
Mr. Go! Mr. Go!

01:45:44.547 --> 01:45:45.006
Mr. Go is coming out!

01:45:45.298 --> 01:45:47.884
He's coming! Here he is!

01:46:20.833 --> 01:46:22.835
Everyone! You're witnessing

01:46:23.169 --> 01:46:25.922
Gorilla on the mound and another at bat

01:46:26.214 --> 01:46:28.674
This is history in the making
for Korean baseball!

01:46:35.139 --> 01:46:36.849
NC Dinos' coach Park!

01:46:37.183 --> 01:46:38.684
He's signaling

01:46:38.976 --> 01:46:39.685
the fielders to move back

01:46:53.282 --> 01:46:54.075
Ling Ling get ready!

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:25.273
Very good Leiting! Great job!

01:47:25.773 --> 01:47:28.359
My baby!

01:47:31.988 --> 01:47:35.366
His injury must be serious
and it's heartbreaking

01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:38.119
It's okay! Just get back up!

01:47:38.453 --> 01:47:41.372
Yes! Just like that!

01:47:41.664 --> 01:47:44.000
His backswing has to be a half tempo faster

01:47:44.417 --> 01:47:45.376
and full swing too!

01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:11.194
Swinging is impossible!
He can't continue like this

01:48:11.527 --> 01:48:14.780
Mr. Go falls prey to Zeros' powerful pitch

01:48:25.875 --> 01:48:27.752
His brace is torn apart

01:48:28.169 --> 01:48:29.504
It's busted

01:48:29.837 --> 01:48:31.547
He's in an impossible situation

01:48:31.964 --> 01:48:34.050
He can't put any weight on his right leg

01:48:34.884 --> 01:48:36.302
Mr. Go looks to be in pain

01:48:37.053 --> 01:48:39.972
He can barely stand up

01:48:41.265 --> 01:48:43.726
He's heading back to the dugout

01:48:44.435 --> 01:48:46.354
Mr. Go is giving up

01:48:47.438 --> 01:48:50.525
He's leaving the plate and I can't look at this

01:48:52.735 --> 01:48:56.739
He just can't do it He can't even stand up

01:48:57.031 --> 01:48:59.784
Doosan's last hope crumbles

01:49:00.284 --> 01:49:01.744
Mr. Go is heading back

01:49:02.119 --> 01:49:05.414
Wait... he's switching sides?

01:49:05.831 --> 01:49:07.708
He's switching batting stance!

01:49:08.292 --> 01:49:09.210
That's incredible!

01:49:09.544 --> 01:49:12.421
He can't use his right leg
as his center of gravity

01:49:12.672 --> 01:49:13.965
so he's shifting

01:49:14.257 --> 01:49:15.800
his weight to the left leg!

01:49:16.217 --> 01:49:17.176
This is amazing!

01:49:17.552 --> 01:49:19.929
How could an animal think of this?

01:49:20.221 --> 01:49:21.472
This is a true display of animal instinct!

01:49:21.889 --> 01:49:22.723
Unbelievable!

01:49:22.974 --> 01:49:24.392
But from the left side

01:49:24.767 --> 01:49:27.353
how will he see Weiwei's signal?

01:49:28.521 --> 01:49:29.522
You're right

01:49:30.022 --> 01:49:32.149
He can't see her whip signal

01:49:32.984 --> 01:49:35.570
She didn't instruct him

01:49:35.987 --> 01:49:37.363
to switch sides either

01:49:37.613 --> 01:49:39.031
So you're saying

01:49:39.365 --> 01:49:41.951
Mr. Go made that decision himself?

01:49:42.201 --> 01:49:44.620
No he couldn't have consciously made
that decision

01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:47.540
Weiwei must have trained him
for this kind of situation

01:49:47.957 --> 01:49:49.417
with enough repetition

01:49:51.627 --> 01:49:53.796
That's the only explanation

01:49:54.297 --> 01:49:57.008
How could an animal think of this on his own?

01:49:57.341 --> 01:49:59.260
It's all due to Weiwei's training!

01:49:59.635 --> 01:50:01.554
She taught him to communicate

01:50:02.179 --> 01:50:04.557
She had the foresight to prepare him

01:50:05.683 --> 01:50:07.268
If you watch Nat Geo

01:50:07.768 --> 01:50:10.479
animals learn through repetition

01:50:27.997 --> 01:50:28.956
Throw!

01:50:59.403 --> 01:51:01.364
The ball explodes!

01:51:01.739 --> 01:51:02.907
The strong bat and the lightning fast ball

01:51:03.199 --> 01:51:04.116
shatters on impact!

01:51:04.408 --> 01:51:05.951
The ball is in a thousand pieces!

01:51:06.285 --> 01:51:08.496
How do you explain this? Is this a foul?

01:51:08.954 --> 01:51:09.914
In the official rule book

01:51:10.164 --> 01:51:11.248
this kind of situation...

01:51:12.375 --> 01:51:13.584
I've never seen this before

01:51:15.336 --> 01:51:16.462
I've never seen a ball explode

01:51:16.837 --> 01:51:17.713
Let's check the rules

01:51:19.006 --> 01:51:20.716
If all the pieces of the ball

01:51:21.008 --> 01:51:22.593
are inside the diamond

01:51:22.927 --> 01:51:26.555
NC has to pick up the pieces

01:51:27.515 --> 01:51:28.557
and gather them...

01:51:28.808 --> 01:51:33.979
gather them together then... run!

01:51:35.147 --> 01:51:35.773
Run!

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:37.942
Tell him to run Weiwei!

01:51:38.693 --> 01:51:40.277
Run!

01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.238
Run!

01:51:42.613 --> 01:51:45.241
Pick up the pieces!

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:49.245
Run!

01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:57.336
Ling Ling hurry!

01:51:57.420 --> 01:51:58.963
You have to run!

01:51:59.213 --> 01:52:00.965
Run Ling Ling!

01:52:11.684 --> 01:52:13.394
Run!

01:52:14.019 --> 01:52:15.479
Hurry!

01:52:19.775 --> 01:52:20.735
Get all the pieces!

01:52:21.068 --> 01:52:22.236
Run!

01:52:22.486 --> 01:52:23.279
Run!

01:53:05.154 --> 01:53:08.115
I don't think Mr. Go made it in time

01:53:09.074 --> 01:53:12.578
Mr. Go's hand is above the player's glove

01:53:12.995 --> 01:53:16.916
He is automatically tagged

01:53:18.167 --> 01:53:19.543
The umpire is about to call

01:53:19.794 --> 01:53:20.920
Why isn't the umpire calling?

01:53:21.837 --> 01:53:24.006
Mr. Go reached the plate too late

01:53:24.507 --> 01:53:27.009
Did the umpire see something?

01:53:27.343 --> 01:53:28.302
He's walking towards it

01:53:29.762 --> 01:53:30.971
It's a piece of the ball!

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:34.600
Look! NC left behind a big piece!

01:53:35.059 --> 01:53:36.811
That is too big of a piece to ignore

01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:38.395
Safe! Safe!

01:53:39.814 --> 01:53:41.065
It's safe! Safe!

01:53:41.357 --> 01:53:42.858
Finally Doosan Bears takes the game

01:53:43.692 --> 01:53:44.610
and wins the Division Finals!

01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:46.237
In a major dramatic turnaround

01:53:46.570 --> 01:53:47.738
Mr. Go and Doosan take the win!

01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.906
It's like a scene out of a movie!

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:50.658
Mr. Go really made it happen!

01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:52.535
An inside-the-park home run!

01:53:58.499 --> 01:53:59.917
A truly remarkable win for Doosan Bears!

01:54:00.251 --> 01:54:01.293
Mr. Go! I knew he could do it!

01:54:01.627 --> 01:54:03.295
Doosan Bears takes the game 7:6

01:54:03.712 --> 01:54:06.048
and moves up to the championship!

01:54:08.592 --> 01:54:12.596
Get up Ling Ling!

01:54:13.347 --> 01:54:14.056
Ling Ling!

01:54:14.557 --> 01:54:19.478
Can you hear me? Ling Ling!

01:54:22.398 --> 01:54:23.107
Ling Ling!

01:54:42.710 --> 01:54:45.129
I'm not calling the cops! No sir!

01:54:45.546 --> 01:54:46.463
Call the ambulance!

01:54:49.425 --> 01:54:51.093
What an incredible play!

01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:52.469
Amazing!

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:53.512
That was unbelievable!

01:54:54.763 --> 01:54:55.347
Look!

01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:15.534
It's okay!

01:55:16.243 --> 01:55:18.037
It's all right

01:55:18.787 --> 01:55:19.455
Calm down

01:55:20.331 --> 01:55:21.832
Calm down everybody

01:55:26.712 --> 01:55:28.380
Love and concern

01:55:38.599 --> 01:55:39.058
Leiting!

01:55:51.862 --> 01:55:53.322
Weiwei get away!

01:55:54.114 --> 01:55:54.740
Weiwei!

01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:57.576
Get away!

01:56:16.303 --> 01:56:18.347
Leiting! Stop it!

01:56:21.433 --> 01:56:22.851
Calm down!

01:56:58.721 --> 01:56:59.304
Ling Ling!

01:57:08.897 --> 01:57:11.900
Weiwei get in! Weiwei!

01:57:12.234 --> 01:57:12.985
What about Ling Ling?

01:57:15.821 --> 01:57:16.447
Let go! No!

01:57:16.864 --> 01:57:17.614
We can't leave Ling Ling!

01:57:19.199 --> 01:57:19.950
Get in!

01:57:21.869 --> 01:57:22.786
Move!

01:57:27.583 --> 01:57:29.460
Ling Ling!

01:57:43.432 --> 01:57:44.016
Hurry!

01:57:45.225 --> 01:57:46.435
Get away!

01:57:50.481 --> 01:57:51.106
Move!

01:57:59.114 --> 01:57:59.656
Mr. Sung?

01:58:05.204 --> 01:58:05.704
Wake up!

01:58:08.707 --> 01:58:09.291
Mr. Sung!

01:59:36.879 --> 01:59:37.963
Ling Ling! Stop it!

01:59:43.844 --> 01:59:44.720
That's enough Ling Ling!

01:59:52.728 --> 01:59:53.145
Don't!

01:59:53.395 --> 01:59:54.897
Please stop!

01:59:57.691 --> 01:59:58.775
It's all my fault

02:00:01.945 --> 02:00:03.864
So... please stop

02:00:06.200 --> 02:00:08.577
Please stop

02:00:09.745 --> 02:00:12.331
Leiting didn't do anything wrong

02:00:13.665 --> 02:00:15.709
Please let him go

02:00:39.524 --> 02:00:40.525
What did she say?

02:00:48.116 --> 02:00:50.744
Please void the contract

02:00:56.333 --> 02:00:57.876
Goodbye

02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:03.882
Call the cops!

Former pro baseball agent

02:03:04.002 --> 02:03:06.129
Sung Choong-su was released today

02:03:06.463 --> 02:03:08.215
in the afternoon after 4 months

02:03:08.507 --> 02:03:09.925
in the afternoon after 4 months

02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:11.718
was made possible

02:03:11.968 --> 02:03:13.970
by Doosan Bears' request to drop charges

02:03:14.346 --> 02:03:15.013
in order to avoid a scene

02:03:15.263 --> 02:03:16.807
Mr. Sung's KBO agent license

02:03:17.265 --> 02:03:18.809
was revoked permanently

02:03:19.101 --> 02:03:20.936
and left the scene hastily

02:03:21.436 --> 02:03:23.063
without any comments

02:04:20.662 --> 02:04:21.997
Meal time!

02:04:34.342 --> 02:04:35.760
Here take it

Don't be picky and eat plenty

02:04:38.221 --> 02:04:38.930
Eat more

02:04:40.015 --> 02:04:41.391
Winter melon's good for you so have more

02:04:42.476 --> 02:04:43.059

02:04:43.643 --> 02:04:44.186
Look

02:04:57.073 --> 02:04:58.408

02:05:00.076 --> 02:05:00.702
