WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:03.402
It was like being inside a nightmare,

00:03.504 --> 00:06.471
then I realized this was not a dream.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.442
There is some sort of infiltration

00:10.544 --> 00:12.211
of society going on.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.614
I think these abduction stories

00:15.716 --> 00:18.350
are all part of a larger plan.

00:18.452 --> 00:22.321
There is a reason why
these people are being returned.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.456
There are people
who are going to bed tonight

00:24.558 --> 00:26.392
who have no idea

00:26.494 --> 00:30.129
that they'll do something that
they've been programmed to do.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.497
That's pretty scary.

00:31.599 --> 00:34.900
Since the dawn of civilization,

00:35.002 --> 00:38.904
mankind has credited its origins to gods

00:39.006 --> 00:42.107
and other visitors from the stars.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.376
What if it were true?

00:44.478 --> 00:47.079
Did extraterrestrial beings

00:47.181 --> 00:50.315
really help to shape our history?

00:50.418 --> 00:54.319
And if so, could the truth lie

00:54.422 --> 00:58.190
with those who have been
taken and returned?

# Ancient Aliens 11x14 #
The Returned
Original Air Date on August 26, 2016

01:32.193 --> 01:35.527
Elista, Kalmykia, Russia.

01:35.629 --> 01:38.430
July 16, 2007.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.634
The President of the Kalmykia Republic,

01:42.736 --> 01:45.304
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov,

01:45.406 --> 01:48.807
discloses in an international
primetime television interview

01:48.909 --> 01:51.376
for Al Jazeera
that nearly a decade prior,

01:51.479 --> 01:54.980
he was abducted by extraterrestrials.

01:57.218 --> 02:01.620
I-I was taken by my apartment in Moscow

02:01.722 --> 02:03.922
to this spaceship.

02:11.532 --> 02:15.667
Ilyumzhinov claimed
he'd been taken aboard a UFO

02:15.769 --> 02:20.172
by extraterrestrials dressed
in these yellow outfits,

02:20.274 --> 02:22.841
and essentially sort of
given a tour of the UFO

02:22.943 --> 02:24.943
onto which he was taken.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.515
It's never been clear exactly how long

02:29.617 --> 02:32.651
he was gone, but he said
it was almost a day

02:32.753 --> 02:34.620
where he was taken far away.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.891
He said to another star,

02:38.993 --> 02:41.693
on this massive vessel.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.529
And this is his claim.

02:43.631 --> 02:47.599
And, it's, I mean, an
unbelievably outrageous claim.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.002
But the problem is that this is a man

02:50.104 --> 02:52.971
who is a very accomplished individual.

02:53.073 --> 02:56.775
And when you listen to him
speak about this,

02:56.877 --> 02:57.809
he's very open about it.

02:57.912 --> 02:59.511
He doesn't sound crazy,

02:59.613 --> 03:01.146
except for the content
of what he's saying.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.063
There's an interesting theory
about his story.

03:18.165 --> 03:22.568
Given his position and his
standing within the government,

03:22.670 --> 03:25.971
when somebody like him speaks out,

03:26.073 --> 03:29.975
it actually adds a great deal
of weight to the UFO subject.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.110
So an argument was made that

03:32.213 --> 03:34.947
perhaps extraterrestrials abducted him

03:35.049 --> 03:38.850
with the very hope that he would
go public with the story,

03:38.953 --> 03:41.486
expose more and more people
to the existence

03:41.589 --> 03:42.854
of the UFO phenomenon.

03:45.893 --> 03:49.494
Ilyumzhinov is
the highest profile individual

03:49.597 --> 03:51.363
to come forward with an admission

03:51.465 --> 03:54.366
of being abducted by extraterrestrials

03:54.468 --> 03:56.602
and subsequently returned to Earth.

03:58.639 --> 04:02.641
However, he is just one
of tens of thousands of people

04:02.743 --> 04:04.476
that have made such claims,

04:04.578 --> 04:09.114
dating back to the infamous case
of Betty and Barney Hill,

04:09.216 --> 04:12.784
who were allegedly abducted
from their vehicle

04:12.886 --> 04:15.621
on a New Hampshire road in 1961.

04:17.858 --> 04:21.459
Purported extraterrestrial
abductions involve men,

04:21.562 --> 04:24.363
women and children of various cultures

04:24.465 --> 04:26.398
and religious backgrounds.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.570
This is a global phenomenon.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.973
I've had people write to me
from all around the world

04:35.075 --> 04:36.408
about their abduction events.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.910
It has nothing to do

04:39.013 --> 04:43.649
with countries and everything
to do with being human.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.618
There are some themes
in these abduction stories

04:46.720 --> 04:49.488
that are universal or at least recur.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.925
Some report being paralyzed.

04:54.028 --> 04:56.461
Many report shifts in time.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.797
Some lose vast amount of time.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.834
It would be one thing

05:02.936 --> 05:07.973
if there were only ten or 20
abduction stories worldwide.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.575
The fact of the matter is that there are

05:10.678 --> 05:13.879
hundreds of thousands
of abduction reports

05:13.981 --> 05:15.781
all around the world.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.116
The real question
we need to ask ourselves

05:18.218 --> 05:20.519
is not whether abduction
is taking place.

05:20.621 --> 05:23.989
It's very obvious
that it's taking place.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.258
We need to try to crack into the mystery

05:26.360 --> 05:29.361
and understand why this is happening.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.197
What makes us so interesting
to these people

05:32.299 --> 05:34.633
that they want to be
bringing us up there,

05:34.735 --> 05:37.169
performing what appear to be
medical experiments,

05:37.271 --> 05:39.338
and then putting us back down on Earth?

05:41.642 --> 05:44.776
Could it be that
hundreds of thousands of people

05:44.878 --> 05:47.512
worldwide have been taken off-planet

05:47.614 --> 05:50.682
only to be placed back into society?

05:50.784 --> 05:54.820
But if so, for what purpose?

05:56.724 --> 06:00.525
Perhaps clues can be found by
exploring the age-old accounts

06:00.627 --> 06:04.062
of human abductions
by otherworldly beings

06:04.164 --> 06:06.832
that can be found
in nearly every culture

06:06.934 --> 06:10.302
throughout the world.

06:10.404 --> 06:14.139
The stories of
the representative of humanity

06:14.241 --> 06:18.343
who is taken to another place
permeate mythic lore.

06:20.114 --> 06:24.049
This is a great universal story.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.952
We have Moses going up onto the mountain

06:27.054 --> 06:29.454
and getting the Commandments
and bringing them down.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.957
We imagine they're on tablets,
and somehow

06:32.059 --> 06:35.827
this is going to be the guidance
of the future of the people.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.463
The prophet Enoch,

06:38.565 --> 06:41.099
the prophet Ezekiel going up into heaven

06:41.201 --> 06:43.301
and learning
all of the things of heaven.

06:43.404 --> 06:47.072
The fairies or fae, in Celtic mythology,

06:47.174 --> 06:49.574
draw you into an adventure.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.010
Often, there is some seduction.

06:52.112 --> 06:54.613
Sometimes, it's a demon
who will force you

06:54.715 --> 06:58.817
away from your path into
something, some kind of hell,

06:58.919 --> 07:00.252
but you somehow escape later

07:00.354 --> 07:02.154
and come back with new knowledge,

07:02.256 --> 07:03.889
new skills, new strengths.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.126
What's curious is, when we look

07:08.228 --> 07:10.929
at the situations,
the stories as described

07:11.031 --> 07:14.800
in ancient literature, and
looking at modern experiences

07:14.902 --> 07:18.804
interpreted as alien abductions,
they seem to be identical.

07:18.906 --> 07:22.841
These stories,
these legends have been around

07:22.943 --> 07:25.210
for centuries.

07:25.312 --> 07:29.581
They can't all just be made up.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.483
There's too many of them.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.986
They're too prolific,
they're too widespread.

07:35.088 --> 07:38.023
There has to be some basis to them.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.892
For what purpose have
these things been happening

07:40.994 --> 07:41.893
throughout history?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.161
Who knows?

07:45.098 --> 07:47.332
Perhaps the most important thread

07:47.434 --> 07:49.501
that runs through the abduction stories

07:49.603 --> 07:52.170
is that all of these people
are returned.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.738
They're not kept.

07:53.841 --> 07:55.006
They're allowed to come back.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.575
They are brought back.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.610
So the question is: Why?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.382
Might what we refer to today

08:04.485 --> 08:09.187
as alien abductions
trace back thousands of years?

08:11.959 --> 08:14.493
If so, are those that are returned

08:14.595 --> 08:18.029
part of a bigger extraterrestrial plan?

08:20.133 --> 08:22.334
Perhaps more evidence can be found

08:22.436 --> 08:24.603
by examining an ancient abduction

08:24.705 --> 08:28.373
that took place in the jungles
of Southeast Asia.

08:34.248 --> 08:37.048
Krong Siem Reap, Cambodia.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.717
1860.

08:40.921 --> 08:42.520
A group of missionaries

08:42.623 --> 08:44.990
traveling through the Cambodian jungle

08:45.092 --> 08:47.359
stumble across the largest

08:47.461 --> 08:51.763
and most elaborate
religious complex in the world,

08:51.865 --> 08:53.365
Angkor Wat.

08:53.467 --> 08:58.270
The Khmer people mysteriously
abandoned the ancient site

08:58.372 --> 09:00.238
in the 15th century.

09:00.340 --> 09:04.042
It was enveloped by
the surrounding vegetation

09:04.144 --> 09:06.611
and lay forgotten for centuries.

09:06.713 --> 09:10.715
Archaeologists believe
construction likely began

09:10.817 --> 09:13.952
under the rule of King Suryavarman II

09:14.054 --> 09:17.355
in 1116 A.D.

09:17.457 --> 09:21.092
Cambodian lore credits its design

09:21.194 --> 09:25.597
to Preah Pisnokar, a half-human,
half-divine architect

09:25.699 --> 09:28.700
who is said to have been
taken off-planet

09:28.802 --> 09:30.402
and returned to Earth

09:30.504 --> 09:33.738
with the plans
to build this advanced complex.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.277
Preah Pisnokar's legend
is one of the best stories

09:39.379 --> 09:42.447
you could ever imagine for
the ancient astronaut theory.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.617
Because in the legend,

09:45.719 --> 09:49.220
he is taken to what's called
Indra's heaven,

09:49.323 --> 09:50.622
that was orbiting the Earth

09:50.724 --> 09:53.792
as described in the ancient Vedic texts.

09:53.894 --> 09:57.362
When Preah Pisnokar first was introduced

09:57.464 --> 09:59.064
to go to Indra's heaven,

09:59.166 --> 10:01.232
he was exposed to this blue light

10:01.335 --> 10:03.268
where he himself describes

10:03.370 --> 10:08.006
how he felt his entire body
being rejuvenated.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.140
And the question is,

10:09.242 --> 10:11.042
could it be that that was some type

10:11.144 --> 10:12.744
of a decontamination pod?

10:16.083 --> 10:18.783
It's quite curious that

10:18.885 --> 10:22.988
an ancient Cambodian legend
like this would contain

10:23.090 --> 10:25.924
a scene where the main character

10:26.026 --> 10:30.328
has to go through some
decontamination process,

10:30.430 --> 10:32.297
and one that's done in space.

10:32.399 --> 10:37.168
It's done in this celestial
home of the gods.

10:40.173 --> 10:43.274
He underwent this intense
education program

10:43.377 --> 10:48.113
and weeks later,
he was rejoining his people,

10:48.215 --> 10:50.949
and he essentially
imparted all this knowledge

10:51.051 --> 10:55.453
that was given to him by the
extraterrestrials to his people.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.726
Upon his return,

11:01.828 --> 11:06.531
Pisnokar is said
to have designed Angkor Wat.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.901
It was built as a replica
of the heavenly original

11:10.003 --> 11:13.638
in anticipation
of the return of the gods.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.509
He's returned to the Earth

11:17.611 --> 11:21.346
to give humans all of this
amazing knowledge,

11:21.448 --> 11:25.050
and to help humans advance.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.251
And, in his case,

11:26.353 --> 11:28.687
by building an amazing temple city

11:28.789 --> 11:33.358
that is one of
the wonders of the world today.

11:33.460 --> 11:36.828
The one issue that people
don't focus on too much

11:36.930 --> 11:38.463
is the matter of

11:38.565 --> 11:42.333
the abductees being returned
from where they were taken.

11:42.436 --> 11:46.037
We can look back
in countless religious texts

11:46.139 --> 11:49.774
where contactees are given
rules and regulations

11:49.876 --> 11:51.943
and ideas to follow

11:52.045 --> 11:56.214
in terms of elevating the human race.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.751
And sometimes they would
build structures for the gods,

11:59.853 --> 12:03.988
doing their bidding,
whatever that might be.

12:04.091 --> 12:08.026
It could well be an ongoing
program that hasn't stopped.

12:08.128 --> 12:11.396
It's just that we don't realize,
necessarily, what's going on.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.500
Is it possible

12:15.602 --> 12:19.070
that the story
of Preah Pisnokar is true?

12:19.172 --> 12:22.240
Are select humans being taken off-planet

12:22.342 --> 12:26.311
and inserted back into society,
even today?

12:26.413 --> 12:29.581
But if so, to what end?

12:31.551 --> 12:33.985
Perhaps more clues can be found

12:34.087 --> 12:38.890
by exploring the details
of modern alien abductions.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.594
Coming up...

12:42.696 --> 12:44.863
We've learned that
abductions start pre-birth

12:44.965 --> 12:46.564
and it starts in family lines.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.833
Most people who are being abducted

12:48.935 --> 12:50.835
don't even know it.
They don't think about it.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.137
They don't dream about it.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.638
They're unaware of it.

13:00.255 --> 13:02.823
Harvard University.

13:02.891 --> 13:04.558
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

13:04.626 --> 13:07.327
1991.

13:07.396 --> 13:09.830
Dr. John E. Mack,

13:09.898 --> 13:13.467
a Harvard professor
and renowned psychiatrist

13:13.535 --> 13:15.435
working with trauma patients,

13:15.537 --> 13:17.604
is convinced by a colleague

13:17.706 --> 13:20.841
to examine those who claim
to have been abducted

13:20.909 --> 13:23.210
by extraterrestrials.

13:23.278 --> 13:25.345
He started, according to him,

13:25.447 --> 13:29.182
having his clients tell him
these very, very detailed

13:29.284 --> 13:31.785
and traumatizing,
in many cases, accounts

13:31.887 --> 13:35.555
of beings coming and taking them,

13:35.657 --> 13:38.692
and doing experimentation,

13:38.794 --> 13:41.661
and even this discussion
of alien hybrids

13:41.730 --> 13:44.865
that were produced from experimentation.

13:44.933 --> 13:46.666
And in the beginning,

13:46.735 --> 13:49.536
he talks about how
he had a lot of trouble

13:49.638 --> 13:51.371
considering this to be even close

13:51.473 --> 13:52.672
to being in the realm of possibility.

13:52.741 --> 13:54.841
You know, he's an ardent academic.

13:54.943 --> 13:58.078
And his job is to find
the rational approach

13:58.180 --> 13:59.746
to what's really going on here.

13:59.848 --> 14:01.782
And, of course, he started
trying to analyze

14:01.850 --> 14:03.450
what's the state of mind
of these people?

14:03.552 --> 14:06.253
Are there any connections
between the type of people

14:06.355 --> 14:07.621
that are recounting these stories?

14:07.723 --> 14:11.892
You know, so that way, he can
develop a psychological profile.

14:11.994 --> 14:13.660
But what he found was that
that's not the case.

14:13.762 --> 14:16.530
These stories were coming from
a wide demographic of people,

14:16.632 --> 14:18.632
people from all over the world.

14:18.734 --> 14:22.736
John Mack was a skeptic.

14:22.838 --> 14:26.406
At first, he didn't believe
a single thing,

14:26.475 --> 14:31.244
but after five or six encounters
with experiencers,

14:31.313 --> 14:33.413
he changed his tune.

14:33.482 --> 14:35.348
So, for a skeptic

14:35.451 --> 14:39.386
to all of a sudden change 180 degrees,

14:39.488 --> 14:41.221
that's amazing.

14:41.323 --> 14:45.826
Because John Mack applied all
of his clinical knowledge

14:45.928 --> 14:48.628
on those experiencers, and due to that,

14:48.730 --> 14:52.065
because it is a science,
he had to conclude

14:52.134 --> 14:54.367
that extraterrestrial visitations

14:54.470 --> 14:57.037
are not a likelihood, but a certainty.

14:57.139 --> 14:59.773
He also said the abduction phenomenon

14:59.875 --> 15:03.310
is not a modern day occurrence only.

15:04.513 --> 15:06.113
He was convinced,

15:06.215 --> 15:08.115
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

15:08.217 --> 15:12.219
that people were being abducted
by extraterrestrials.

15:12.321 --> 15:13.520
He was ridiculed,

15:13.622 --> 15:16.189
scorned by his colleagues,

15:16.291 --> 15:18.792
laughed at, but he did not stop.

15:18.894 --> 15:21.995
He continued to try to get these answers

15:22.064 --> 15:25.332
as to what was happening
to these people.

15:25.434 --> 15:27.501
During the course of his research,

15:27.603 --> 15:30.270
Dr. John Mack came to realize

15:30.339 --> 15:33.273
that the alien abduction phenomenon

15:33.342 --> 15:35.609
wasn't one of scarcity.

15:35.711 --> 15:38.378
It was essentially an epidemic.

15:38.447 --> 15:41.214
Reports were coming from
all across the planet.

15:41.316 --> 15:45.652
But more importantly, there were
people who had had vague dreams

15:45.721 --> 15:48.021
and memories of something going on,

15:48.123 --> 15:51.525
but clearly didn't realize
they'd been abducted.

15:51.627 --> 15:53.426
And this suggested to John Mack

15:53.529 --> 15:56.630
that there were what we could
call "silent abductees."

15:58.167 --> 15:59.699
Most people who are being abducted

15:59.801 --> 16:02.235
don't even know it.
They don't think about it.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.070
They don't dream about it.

16:04.173 --> 16:05.338
They're unaware of it.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.274
Because, I believe,
the extraterrestrials

16:07.376 --> 16:09.676
have somehow washed their memory.

16:09.778 --> 16:12.145
However, in hypnosis,

16:12.247 --> 16:14.314
when you regress somebody,

16:14.416 --> 16:16.983
you may be able to pick up things

16:17.085 --> 16:19.686
where they do
recollect what has happened.

16:19.788 --> 16:23.356
It happened in the original case
of Barney and Betty Hill,

16:23.458 --> 16:25.725
where the psychiatrist,
Dr. Benjamin Simon,

16:25.827 --> 16:28.128
put them under via hypnosis.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.230
And that's when they started talking

16:30.332 --> 16:32.666
about the things that had happened.

16:32.734 --> 16:35.168
You cannot erase the mind permanently,

16:35.270 --> 16:37.370
and-and the ETs know that,

16:37.472 --> 16:41.007
but in terms of just full consciousness,

16:41.109 --> 16:43.310
they're able to knock it out.

16:43.378 --> 16:46.413
There are people who are
going to bed tonight

16:46.481 --> 16:48.081
who have no idea

16:48.183 --> 16:50.850
that they may be abducted
by extraterrestrials.

16:50.919 --> 16:53.587
They won't remember it,
and they won't recall it,

16:53.655 --> 16:55.055
and they won't even know.

16:55.123 --> 16:56.923
The big question is why?

16:58.660 --> 17:00.460
While researchers suggest

17:00.562 --> 17:03.063
that many individuals
that have been returned

17:03.165 --> 17:04.531
may never be identified,

17:04.633 --> 17:08.234
they believe clues
to the extraterrestrial motive

17:08.303 --> 17:11.503
may be found in the specific
characteristic traits

17:11.573 --> 17:13.940
of those being taken.

17:15.844 --> 17:18.111
1999.

17:18.213 --> 17:21.214
The International Community
for Alien Research

17:21.316 --> 17:25.151
begins conducting the largest
and most in-depth study

17:25.220 --> 17:28.822
into the specific
characteristics of abductees.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.857
The International
Community for Alien Research

17:30.959 --> 17:33.560
was founded by about
a half a dozen ufologists

17:33.662 --> 17:35.128
who were not satisfied
with what was going on

17:35.230 --> 17:36.896
in the field at the time.

17:36.999 --> 17:39.833
There wasn't new legitimate
abduction research being done.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.534
Started with the questionnaire,

17:41.637 --> 17:44.070
which is now going on
about 13 years now.

17:44.139 --> 17:45.605
I believe about 18,000 contactees

17:45.674 --> 17:47.540
have taken the study.

17:47.643 --> 17:49.809
What this has told us is
it's showed us similarities

17:49.878 --> 17:52.112
in all of these abductions.

17:52.214 --> 17:53.713
We've learned that
abductions start pre-birth

17:53.782 --> 17:56.082
and it starts in family lines.

17:56.151 --> 17:59.119
The findings of the study also showed

17:59.221 --> 18:01.788
a greater percentage
of individuals with hazel

18:01.890 --> 18:04.591
or green eyes are being abducted,

18:04.693 --> 18:08.762
as well as those having
Rh negative blood types.

18:08.864 --> 18:11.731
"The Rh Factor"

18:11.833 --> 18:14.134
refers to the presence
of specific proteins

18:14.236 --> 18:16.870
or antigens in the blood.

18:16.972 --> 18:18.905
Most humans have these antigens,

18:18.974 --> 18:21.741
and are considered Rh positive.

18:21.843 --> 18:24.411
About 25,000 to 35,000 years ago,

18:24.513 --> 18:27.647
out of the blue, no scientist
today understands why,

18:27.716 --> 18:29.716
Rh negative emerged on the scene.

18:29.785 --> 18:31.484
Most people don't realize,

18:31.586 --> 18:33.720
but man was just
positive blood until then.

18:33.789 --> 18:35.922
There was no Rh negative.

18:35.991 --> 18:38.458
Really what's funny about this is,

18:38.527 --> 18:41.161
is why would Mother Nature
create Rh negative?

18:41.263 --> 18:42.962
What's odd about both the Rh negative

18:43.065 --> 18:45.432
and the green eyes is they're mutations.

18:45.534 --> 18:46.666
They're both rare.

18:46.768 --> 18:49.369
Rh negative is only
15% of world population.

18:49.438 --> 18:51.504
Green-eyed people, I think,
make up two or three percent

18:51.606 --> 18:53.340
of the world's population.

18:53.442 --> 18:57.877
But almost 50% of contactees
have hazel or green eyes.

18:57.979 --> 19:00.113
We don't think the color, per
se, has anything to do with it.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.215
It's the fact that it's a mutation,

19:02.317 --> 19:04.484
and for some reason
the extraterrestrials either

19:04.553 --> 19:06.353
created it or if they didn't create it,

19:06.455 --> 19:09.189
they seemed to have
an extreme interest in it.

19:09.257 --> 19:11.424
Could there really be

19:11.526 --> 19:13.226
a genetic component at play

19:13.328 --> 19:17.130
in the extraterrestrial
abduction phenomenon?

19:17.232 --> 19:20.266
And might these lineages trace back

19:20.369 --> 19:23.670
to the ancient accounts
of otherworldly encounters?

19:23.739 --> 19:26.172
If so, does this provide

19:26.274 --> 19:29.743
insight into a long-term agenda?

19:29.845 --> 19:32.245
Perhaps further clues can be found

19:32.347 --> 19:35.882
by extracting what lies
buried in the memories

19:35.984 --> 19:38.718
of those that have been returned.

19:38.820 --> 19:41.721
And by examining
what might also be hidden

19:41.823 --> 19:44.290
beneath their skin.

19:46.828 --> 19:48.495
Coming up...

19:48.563 --> 19:50.563
It turns out that the objects are

19:50.665 --> 19:52.465
meteoric in origin.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.400
This is amazing.

19:53.468 --> 19:55.435
You can see the little objects here.

19:55.537 --> 19:56.703
Perfect T.

19:56.805 --> 19:59.038
How did it get into the woman's body?

20:04.620 --> 20:07.621
Ulster County, New York.

20:07.723 --> 20:11.124
December 26, 1985.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.529
Best-selling fiction author
Whitley Strieber

20:15.631 --> 20:18.799
is vacationing at his cabin
when he experiences

20:18.901 --> 20:22.402
a strange event that will
forever change his life.

20:22.504 --> 20:24.871
I woke up in the middle of the night,

20:24.974 --> 20:26.473
right after Christmas,

20:26.575 --> 20:30.110
in an incredibly peculiar situation.

20:30.212 --> 20:32.012
It was like being inside a nightmare,

20:32.114 --> 20:33.747
and at the time,
I was a horror novelist,

20:33.849 --> 20:35.983
and I thought, "Oh, good,"
but only for a second

20:36.085 --> 20:38.685
because then I realized
this was not a dream.

20:38.787 --> 20:40.454
It was not going away.

20:40.556 --> 20:44.758
I had these big-eyed creatures
in front of me,

20:44.860 --> 20:47.761
like big insects, and I was
in a little round room.

20:47.863 --> 20:51.765
And these other darting,
dark-blue figures were there.

20:51.867 --> 20:55.702
It degenerated very quickly into

20:55.804 --> 20:59.306
what amounted to a kind of assault.

20:59.408 --> 21:03.477
I, then, found myself
the next morning, waking up

21:03.579 --> 21:09.583
feeling pretty beat up
and very, very confused.

21:09.685 --> 21:10.784
What could've happened?

21:10.886 --> 21:12.419
Was it a nightmare?

21:12.521 --> 21:13.520
What was it?

21:14.823 --> 21:16.223
According to Strieber,

21:16.325 --> 21:19.893
these strange abductions
continued to occur.

21:19.995 --> 21:21.595
And after one of his experiences,

21:21.697 --> 21:26.066
he was returned with physical proof.

21:26.168 --> 21:28.402
My ear began to hurt,

21:28.504 --> 21:29.836
the top of my ear, and I felt it,

21:29.938 --> 21:32.305
and it was a little lump.

21:32.408 --> 21:35.642
That lump...

21:35.744 --> 21:37.744
had not been there before.

21:37.846 --> 21:39.679
I went to a doctor,

21:39.782 --> 21:41.748
and he said, "It's a little cyst.

21:41.850 --> 21:43.016
I'll take care of it."

21:44.453 --> 21:46.653
When he opened it up, he said,

21:46.755 --> 21:49.189
"It's a disk."

21:49.291 --> 21:51.425
Then he touched it with his scalpel,

21:51.527 --> 21:54.027
and it went down into the
peanu-- the bottom of my ear.

21:54.129 --> 21:56.329
And he pulled out, immediately said,

21:56.432 --> 21:58.331
"I don't know what to do about this,"

21:58.434 --> 22:00.434
and closed it up.

22:00.536 --> 22:04.271
Could it be that
people are being returned

22:04.373 --> 22:08.075
with objects implanted in them?

22:08.177 --> 22:12.112
Objects of otherworldly origins?

22:16.652 --> 22:18.785
Houston, Texas.

22:18.887 --> 22:23.590
Former law enforcement officer
and investigator, Derrel Sims,

22:23.692 --> 22:26.460
has spent three decades
collecting evidence

22:26.562 --> 22:30.163
left behind at abduction scenes
throughout the country.

22:30.265 --> 22:32.365
I treat it as a crime scene.

22:32.468 --> 22:35.202
And to do that you need
to know what to look for.

22:35.304 --> 22:37.771
In some of these cases,
we'll find a burn mark,

22:37.873 --> 22:41.575
and in rare cases, radiation
traces where a UFO has landed.

22:41.677 --> 22:44.411
People will come back with a scar

22:44.513 --> 22:46.313
like a dermatological scoop mark.

22:46.415 --> 22:49.783
And sometimes we find
some type of implant.

22:49.885 --> 22:51.351
Thank you for coming by, Giorgio.

22:51.453 --> 22:55.155
In April 2016, Giorgio Tsoukalos

22:55.257 --> 22:58.458
met with Derrel Sims
to get a closer look

22:58.560 --> 23:00.961
at some of the hard evidence that Sims

23:01.063 --> 23:03.363
has collected through the years.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.365
One of the things we found

23:05.467 --> 23:08.602
on these abductees is

23:08.704 --> 23:10.804
-alien leaves like
a fingerprint on them. -Really?

23:10.906 --> 23:13.073
And when they touch them, it leaves

23:13.175 --> 23:15.308
a subdermal mark on you
in the form of fingerprints,

23:15.410 --> 23:16.843
-or of long fingers.
-Mm-hmm.

23:16.945 --> 23:18.311
And here's an example.

23:20.115 --> 23:21.448
It impacts the body subdermally.

23:21.550 --> 23:22.616
This is amazing.

23:22.718 --> 23:24.784
It-it literally goes into the skin.

23:24.887 --> 23:26.086
And you can't wash it off,
you can't get it off

23:26.188 --> 23:28.455
with any kind of solvent or anything.

23:32.227 --> 23:33.093
And here is another good example.

23:33.195 --> 23:34.995
Mm-hmm.

23:35.097 --> 23:36.596
Here are some other handprints

23:36.698 --> 23:37.931
that we've found around the world.

23:38.033 --> 23:39.733
This is in Chile.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.701
The lady who got touched by this entity

23:41.803 --> 23:43.937
with huge prints on both front and back.

23:44.039 --> 23:45.906
And left caustic burns on her body.

23:46.008 --> 23:48.341
-So this was visible light.
-Okay.

23:48.443 --> 23:50.110
This same handprint literally shows up

23:50.212 --> 23:51.411
in several other cases as well.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.947
A little girl shows the same exact hand.

23:54.049 --> 23:55.916
This was fluorescence.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.951
Mm-hmm.

23:58.053 --> 23:59.519
A police officer gets abducted.

23:59.621 --> 24:01.421
The entity actually comes
through the glass window

24:01.523 --> 24:04.491
and left the holographic
imagery in the glass.

24:04.593 --> 24:06.459
Very odd.

24:06.562 --> 24:08.662
Here's one that fascinates me.

24:08.764 --> 24:11.965
This is a print that came off
a wall in Pennsylvania.

24:12.067 --> 24:13.400
The entire family are abductees

24:13.502 --> 24:15.235
with the exception of one person

24:15.337 --> 24:17.370
and this one touched
the wall and you can see

24:17.472 --> 24:20.407
the fluorescence there
where we lit it up.

24:20.509 --> 24:21.474
-Mm-hmm.
-This is the case of,

24:21.577 --> 24:24.644
uh, a lady that this is our long fing--

24:24.746 --> 24:26.079
You see the huge, long fingerprints

24:26.181 --> 24:29.082
and the suction cups
on these forefingers.

24:29.184 --> 24:31.551
And this is on her headboard.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.155
That's fantastic.

24:35.257 --> 24:38.692
You've now spent
many years studying this.

24:38.794 --> 24:42.762
And you see fingerprints
like that, handprints,

24:42.864 --> 24:44.598
and you know, residue,

24:44.700 --> 24:48.068
what is your theory
what we are looking at here?

24:48.170 --> 24:50.737
My estimation as a former police officer

24:50.839 --> 24:53.106
is that there was an oil-like substance

24:53.208 --> 24:56.109
that apparently exudes
from the body of the entity.

24:56.211 --> 24:59.446
That's bizarre.

24:59.548 --> 25:00.847
There's some actual implants...

25:00.949 --> 25:03.550
Perhaps the most
intriguing pieces of evidence

25:03.652 --> 25:06.987
in Sims' collection are
the alleged extraterrestrial

25:07.089 --> 25:10.223
implants retrieved from various victims.

25:14.162 --> 25:18.431
I want to show you something
rather remarkable.

25:18.533 --> 25:19.666
You can see the little objects here--

25:19.768 --> 25:21.701
the perfect T
and the one off to the side?

25:21.803 --> 25:23.270
Yes.

25:26.074 --> 25:29.075
So we had them surgically excised.

25:29.177 --> 25:30.844
And here's what we found.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.246
-There's a good look at them.
-Oh, wow!

25:33.348 --> 25:34.581
-After they're taken out.
-Okay.

25:34.683 --> 25:37.484
There was a biological cocoon

25:37.586 --> 25:39.185
surrounding these originally.

25:39.288 --> 25:41.621
This is bizarre.

25:41.723 --> 25:44.858
And-and what did they determine this is?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.693
We had this done in a blinded study--

25:46.795 --> 25:47.994
Los Alamos, New Mexico Tech.

25:48.096 --> 25:50.697
They did a qualitative
and quantitative analysis.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.333
And they found-- Giorgio,
you're not gonna believe this.

25:53.435 --> 25:57.837
It turns out that the objects
are meteoric in origin.

26:01.343 --> 26:03.143
What's your opinion then?

26:03.245 --> 26:05.745
And how did it get
into the woman's body?

26:05.847 --> 26:07.647
In my opinion,

26:07.749 --> 26:09.549
what we're looking at
are objects that have been

26:09.651 --> 26:11.017
installed inside these people.

26:11.119 --> 26:13.953
Someone is doing this.

26:14.056 --> 26:16.323
This is entity-related.

26:18.293 --> 26:20.927
So, in my opinion, we're looking
at real, actual evidence

26:21.029 --> 26:22.829
of these cases.

26:22.931 --> 26:24.664
Well, this is amazing.

26:24.766 --> 26:28.034
Is it possible that
the implants collected

26:28.136 --> 26:30.203
from the bodies of alleged abductees

26:30.305 --> 26:33.006
are of extraterrestrial origin?

26:33.108 --> 26:37.077
But if so, what is their purpose?

26:37.179 --> 26:39.979
-Are aliens tracking humans
-(rhythmic heartbeat)

26:40.082 --> 26:43.116
on whom they've performed
medical experiments?

26:43.218 --> 26:45.985
Or might their ultimate agenda

26:46.088 --> 26:49.289
be even more profound?

26:49.391 --> 26:52.225
Perhaps further clues
can be found by exploring

26:52.327 --> 26:54.994
what many researchers believe

26:55.097 --> 26:58.164
is the most compelling abduction
account in modern history.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.336
Coming up...

27:03.438 --> 27:05.305
He remembered a computer screen

27:05.407 --> 27:06.906
in front of him.

27:07.008 --> 27:08.308
Letters and numbers,

27:08.410 --> 27:10.143
of the alien world.

27:10.245 --> 27:12.178
People who are being abducted

27:12.280 --> 27:13.913
are being programmed.

27:21.731 --> 27:23.998
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.200
1998.

27:26.303 --> 27:31.139
Investigative Journalist
Linda Moulton Howe publishes

27:31.241 --> 27:36.811
Glimpses of Other Realities
Volume II: High Strangeness.

27:36.913 --> 27:40.748
In it, she includes material
on human interactions

27:40.850 --> 27:44.452
with extraterrestrial beings
and what she considers

27:44.554 --> 27:48.990
one of the most compelling
abduction cases on record.

27:49.092 --> 27:50.892
As a reporter

27:50.994 --> 27:54.062
who has always been investigating issues

27:54.164 --> 27:56.798
having to do with science,
medicine and the environment,

27:56.900 --> 28:00.601
which is how I came into finding
myself talking with people

28:00.704 --> 28:02.870
in the human abduction syndrome.

28:02.973 --> 28:07.208
I remember it was 1995
at the Eureka Springs Ozark

28:07.310 --> 28:08.910
UFO Conference

28:09.012 --> 28:12.280
and I was introduced to Jim Sparks.

28:12.382 --> 28:14.015
And he unfolded

28:14.117 --> 28:17.018
one of the most amazing
human abduction stories

28:17.120 --> 28:18.720
I've ever heard.

28:21.057 --> 28:22.490
With Jim,

28:22.592 --> 28:25.994
he was aware of literally going
through the ceiling,

28:26.096 --> 28:27.862
going through the roof.

28:27.964 --> 28:30.765
Many people in the abduction
syndrome will describe this.

28:30.867 --> 28:32.300
And he could see trees.

28:32.402 --> 28:36.604
He could see the land receding.

28:36.706 --> 28:39.407
But then, there would be
a blackout period.

28:39.509 --> 28:42.176
And then, he would be in
the world of what he calls

28:42.278 --> 28:45.680
"the Grey beings"

28:45.782 --> 28:48.082
of which there are many different types.

28:48.184 --> 28:51.753
And, he said one day,
he remembered a computer screen

28:51.855 --> 28:53.921
in front of him.

28:55.558 --> 28:58.326
And that he knew that they were
trying to make him

28:58.428 --> 29:01.496
learn an alien symbol.

29:01.598 --> 29:05.133
They wanted him to trace,
for example, "A,"

29:05.235 --> 29:06.734
the letter "A" in the alphabet.

29:06.836 --> 29:11.339
It would be a line drawn
from right to left,

29:11.441 --> 29:14.175
left to right, right to left.

29:14.277 --> 29:16.444
And it was the motion,

29:16.546 --> 29:19.514
let alone just looks like a line.

29:19.616 --> 29:22.884
But he said every one of their
symbols and numbers

29:22.986 --> 29:25.319
had embedded frequencies.

29:28.024 --> 29:30.024
In yet another encounter,

29:30.126 --> 29:32.126
Sparks claimed to have been presented

29:32.228 --> 29:33.928
with a sequence of images

29:34.030 --> 29:36.164
depicting past lifetimes,

29:36.266 --> 29:38.833
including scenes of ancient Rome

29:38.935 --> 29:43.438
and culminating with images
of primitive humans.

29:43.540 --> 29:46.174
When they went to an image

29:46.276 --> 29:48.176
and showed him primates,

29:48.278 --> 29:49.377
like in a forest,

29:49.479 --> 29:52.380
he finally got it.

29:52.482 --> 29:56.751
They have manipulated DNA
and already evolving primates

29:56.853 --> 29:59.787
to create something
that was a hybrid of them,

29:59.889 --> 30:02.790
and that life-form on this planet.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.627
When you look at his account,

30:06.729 --> 30:10.264
you have to wonder if these
abductions of humans

30:10.366 --> 30:12.934
by extraterrestrials don't go back

30:13.036 --> 30:15.303
many thousands and thousands of years,

30:15.405 --> 30:19.507
and in fact certain human beings
were selected,

30:19.609 --> 30:22.376
brought perhaps to a space station,

30:22.479 --> 30:25.480
or an orbiting spaceship,
or a city of the gods,

30:25.582 --> 30:27.448
given a special education,

30:27.550 --> 30:30.384
and then returned to the Earth.

30:30.487 --> 30:33.387
Jim Sparks would later claim

30:33.490 --> 30:36.958
that extraterrestrials
are somehow manipulating

30:37.060 --> 30:40.094
abductees' so-called junk DNA,

30:40.196 --> 30:43.431
the 97% of human DNA

30:43.533 --> 30:47.301
for which scientists have not
been able to find any purpose.

30:47.403 --> 30:50.037
Geneticists used to believe

30:50.140 --> 30:54.208
that a large percent
of our DNA was unused.

30:54.310 --> 30:56.577
Recent discoveries have proven, however,

30:56.679 --> 30:58.479
that there are hidden switches.

30:58.581 --> 31:01.716
There are hidden signals
within that junk DNA

31:01.818 --> 31:04.519
that is gonna ultimately
reveal a treasure trove

31:04.621 --> 31:06.254
of new human capabilities.

31:06.356 --> 31:09.991
Jim believed that
people who are being abducted

31:10.093 --> 31:13.161
are being programmed
that at any given time,

31:13.263 --> 31:14.629
the ETs

31:14.731 --> 31:16.430
(snaps) will send a signal,

31:16.533 --> 31:19.567
and these people will react
and do something,

31:19.669 --> 31:21.435
almost like a sleeper-soldier.

31:21.538 --> 31:22.837
They'll immediately do something

31:22.939 --> 31:25.473
that they've been programmed to do,

31:25.575 --> 31:27.341
whatever that might be.

31:27.443 --> 31:29.143
That's pretty scary.

31:29.245 --> 31:32.213
Early on, when I started
doing abduction research,

31:32.315 --> 31:34.382
people would tell me, I think
something is gonna happen

31:34.484 --> 31:36.150
in the future and
I'm gonna have to do something.

31:36.252 --> 31:40.488
Serious people who I've worked
with for a long time

31:40.590 --> 31:43.591
have told me that, uh, they have
been injected with knowledge,

31:43.693 --> 31:45.993
they're not sure what it is,

31:46.095 --> 31:49.463
but it will be switched on eventually

31:49.566 --> 31:52.166
when the time comes
and they will know it.

31:52.268 --> 31:55.436
And I have come to think that
that is actually correct.

31:55.538 --> 31:57.004
That that is true.

31:57.106 --> 31:59.207
It's an all-encompassing thing.

31:59.309 --> 32:02.410
The sleeper-soldiers will
start to get things ready.

32:02.512 --> 32:06.247
Those who are already here will
start to get things ready.

32:06.349 --> 32:10.284
And also don't forget
the millions of hybrids

32:10.386 --> 32:13.187
that they have been making
since the beginning of time,

32:13.289 --> 32:16.724
that they've probably got
on some mothership somewhere

32:16.826 --> 32:18.826
just ready to start bringing them in.

32:20.863 --> 32:23.764
Could it be that some abductees

32:23.866 --> 32:27.134
have been returned as
preparation by extraterrestrials

32:27.237 --> 32:29.136
for some future mission?

32:29.239 --> 32:33.074
A mission that has been
in the works for hundreds,

32:33.176 --> 32:35.443
if not thousands, of years?

32:35.545 --> 32:38.679
And might it involve the integration

32:38.781 --> 32:41.616
of alien-human hybrids on Earth?

32:41.718 --> 32:46.520
Some abduction experts suggest
that such hybrids are,

32:46.623 --> 32:49.957
in fact, already here.

32:51.461 --> 32:52.994
There was some sort of

32:53.096 --> 32:55.730
infiltration of society going on.

32:55.832 --> 32:58.599
Are we dealing with hybrids

32:58.701 --> 33:01.802
who will replace humans?

33:10.906 --> 33:13.673
Pacific Palisades, California.

33:13.775 --> 33:17.010
July 17, 2015.

33:17.112 --> 33:18.444
5:00 p.m.

33:18.546 --> 33:22.615
Police are alerted that
inside an abandoned SUV

33:22.717 --> 33:26.219
parked on a residential street
is a dead body.

33:26.321 --> 33:30.823
The badly decomposed corpse is
sent to the coroner's office

33:30.926 --> 33:34.394
so that identification
of the victim can be made.

33:34.496 --> 33:36.129
-(indistinct radio chatter)
-Although foul play

33:36.231 --> 33:37.530
is not suspected,

33:37.632 --> 33:40.233
-(siren wails) -as police
continue to investigate,

33:40.335 --> 33:44.137
the case takes a bizarre turn.

33:45.640 --> 33:48.975
The body is identified by his fiancée

33:49.077 --> 33:51.811
as 60-year-old Jeffrey Alan Lash.

33:54.849 --> 33:58.451
Los Angeles police find more
than 1,200 guns

33:58.553 --> 34:00.987
and seven tons of ammunition,

34:01.089 --> 34:03.623
along with numerous militarized vehicles

34:03.725 --> 34:08.094
and $230,000 in cash inside of his home.

34:09.597 --> 34:13.366
His fiancée reports that Lash
had proclaimed to be

34:13.467 --> 34:17.603
an alien hybrid secretly
working for the government.

34:17.706 --> 34:20.706
It's the weirdest story
I think I've ever heard.

34:20.809 --> 34:26.379
His girlfriend, and she seems to
be pretty normal and legit,

34:26.481 --> 34:28.815
claims that he's an alien hybrid.

34:28.917 --> 34:31.016
That he was placed on this planet

34:31.119 --> 34:32.752
to do something specifically.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.286
Nothing adds up about his case.

34:34.389 --> 34:35.788
Nothing.

34:35.889 --> 34:38.056
When examining the body,

34:38.159 --> 34:39.359
the coroner's office

34:39.460 --> 34:41.327
could not find any fingerprints,

34:41.429 --> 34:43.029
even though fingerprints

34:43.130 --> 34:46.866
are the last skin tissue to decompose.

34:46.967 --> 34:51.371
Lash apparently had no fingerprints.

34:51.473 --> 34:55.074
His fiancée believed
that he was an alien hybrid.

34:55.176 --> 34:58.044
And we have to wonder who this guy was.

34:58.146 --> 35:00.613
Was he really
an alien hybrid as he said?

35:00.715 --> 35:04.751
Why did he have all these weapons?

35:04.853 --> 35:07.453
A number of people who have claimed

35:07.555 --> 35:10.056
that they have been abducted
by extraterrestrials

35:10.158 --> 35:12.725
also claim that they've witnessed

35:12.827 --> 35:16.462
what they say are alien-human hybrids.

35:16.564 --> 35:18.564
And this would indicate

35:18.666 --> 35:22.502
that the extraterrestrials
have a program

35:22.604 --> 35:26.706
of manipulating people and their DNA

35:26.808 --> 35:31.277
to genetically alter us slightly.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.112
And perhaps this has been

35:33.214 --> 35:36.582
going on for thousands of years.

35:36.684 --> 35:38.618
And that even as we are today,

35:38.720 --> 35:42.055
we've been manipulated subtly

35:42.157 --> 35:43.556
by extraterrestrials.

35:43.658 --> 35:45.591
And this is still going on.

35:45.693 --> 35:48.661
As more and more people
around the planet

35:48.763 --> 35:51.364
have been experiencing,

35:51.466 --> 35:53.599
whether they are seeing lights,
whether they are being taken,

35:53.701 --> 35:55.301
whether they have missing time,

35:55.403 --> 35:58.971
there is a global evolution
of a relationship

35:59.074 --> 36:03.042
with an alien presence
that by the 21st century

36:03.144 --> 36:07.780
has moved from creatures
from outer space

36:07.882 --> 36:11.451
to human-ET hybrids
that are a combination

36:11.553 --> 36:14.420
of something alien and something human.

36:14.522 --> 36:17.290
And in that evolution,

36:17.392 --> 36:20.226
we are now seeing
a hybridization program

36:20.328 --> 36:21.761
on this planet.

36:23.231 --> 36:25.264
Is it possible that Lash's claim

36:25.366 --> 36:29.068
to be an alien hybrid
might actually be true?

36:29.170 --> 36:32.972
For the last decade,
self-proclaimed abductees

36:33.074 --> 36:35.641
have been coming to Dr. David Jacobs

36:35.743 --> 36:37.343
in rapidly increasing numbers,

36:37.445 --> 36:40.012
with alarmingly similar stories

36:40.115 --> 36:42.849
of alien hybrid integration
into society.

36:45.887 --> 36:49.455
What I've had now recently is people

36:49.557 --> 36:53.192
who have befriended hybrids

36:53.294 --> 36:56.095
who have come down to live here.

36:56.197 --> 36:58.531
The hybrid looks absolutely human.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.133
There is no difference whatsoever,

37:00.235 --> 37:05.004
except one major,
major, major difference.

37:06.174 --> 37:07.740
They are telepathic

37:07.842 --> 37:09.709
and they are neurologically controlling.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.478
They can control people's minds.

37:12.580 --> 37:16.349
They can make people think
or do or act any way they want.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.551
And we can't do that.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.220
That would make us
a second-class species.

37:21.322 --> 37:25.224
The question is
are we dealing with hybrids

37:25.326 --> 37:28.194
who will replace humans

37:28.296 --> 37:33.065
or who will live alongside
humans and control them?

37:33.168 --> 37:36.369
I don't really know the answer to that.

37:37.906 --> 37:39.906
Could it be that there really are

37:40.008 --> 37:43.042
alien hybrids
currently living amongst us?

37:44.479 --> 37:46.779
As fantastic as it may sound,

37:46.881 --> 37:48.481
recent statements made by some

37:48.583 --> 37:50.783
of the world's most powerful leaders

37:50.885 --> 37:53.920
may just point to such a scenario.

37:57.934 --> 37:59.834
Moscow, Russia.

37:59.936 --> 38:03.571
December 7, 2012.

38:03.673 --> 38:07.441
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev

38:07.543 --> 38:11.545
gives a primetime network
television interview.

38:11.648 --> 38:13.447
But after the interview is over,

38:13.549 --> 38:15.750
he makes a shocking statement,

38:15.852 --> 38:19.654
not realizing that his
microphone is still on.

38:41.678 --> 38:43.577
He said, "When you
become President of Russia,

38:43.680 --> 38:47.949
"you're given information
on aliens in our country,

38:48.051 --> 38:52.486
and the human groups
that are monitoring them."

38:52.588 --> 38:54.322
And you know, what's interesting
about this video,

38:54.424 --> 38:56.557
the journalist that he was talking with,

38:56.659 --> 38:59.427
she was laughing nervously
while he was doing this.

38:59.495 --> 39:01.162
But he was totally with a straight face

39:01.230 --> 39:02.863
during all of this.

39:09.038 --> 39:11.672
Here he is on film saying

39:11.774 --> 39:13.441
that extraterrestrials live amongst us.

39:13.509 --> 39:15.609
And I don't think this was an accident.

39:15.712 --> 39:19.280
I believe that what he was
doing was part of a policy

39:19.382 --> 39:21.649
that the Russian government has begun

39:21.751 --> 39:23.684
implementing at the highest level

39:23.786 --> 39:26.887
to prepare its citizens for the truth.

39:30.693 --> 39:32.893
Is it possible
that there are already aliens

39:32.996 --> 39:35.663
living among us and that our governments

39:35.765 --> 39:39.467
are fully aware of this?

39:39.535 --> 39:41.435
Could this be the culmination

39:41.537 --> 39:45.139
of years of extraterrestrial abductions?

39:47.510 --> 39:49.744
Our decisions here as a species

39:49.812 --> 39:53.714
could very well be affecting
these other civilizations.

39:53.816 --> 39:57.084
So they may be in a sense
intervening on their own behalf.

39:57.186 --> 40:00.955
They might not really care about
whether we make it or not.

40:04.093 --> 40:07.862
If invasion and takeover of the planet

40:07.964 --> 40:10.064
were the goal of these extraterrestrial

40:10.166 --> 40:13.067
biological entities,
they are so advanced,

40:13.169 --> 40:15.903
it could be done easily.

40:16.005 --> 40:17.671
Therefore, invasion

40:17.740 --> 40:20.608
and takeover of the world
cannot be their goal.

40:20.710 --> 40:23.010
And if that is not the goal,

40:23.112 --> 40:26.547
then what is the goal?

40:26.649 --> 40:30.317
What is the alien agenda?

40:30.420 --> 40:33.621
You have a sort of dichotomy of

40:33.723 --> 40:35.823
are we being invaded by
terrible extraterrestrials

40:35.925 --> 40:38.092
who are trying to take over our planet?

40:38.194 --> 40:42.063
Or are the extraterrestrials
really trying to help us

40:42.165 --> 40:44.632
and that this has been an ongoing thing

40:44.734 --> 40:46.634
for many thousands of years?

40:48.171 --> 40:50.638
I think

40:50.740 --> 40:54.508
these abduction stories
are all part of a larger plan.

40:54.577 --> 41:00.281
A plan going on for a very long time.

41:00.383 --> 41:03.918
What we are experiencing now
is the next step,

41:04.020 --> 41:07.755
where we are now learning
that we are not alone,

41:07.857 --> 41:10.758
and that they soon will come back,

41:10.860 --> 41:14.862
because that is what they
promised in the ancient texts.

41:16.199 --> 41:17.932
Are extraterrestrials

41:18.034 --> 41:19.967
really coming to Earth

41:20.036 --> 41:22.203
in order to capture

41:22.305 --> 41:24.672
and examine human specimens?

41:26.209 --> 41:30.144
And if so, is their plan to join us

41:30.213 --> 41:32.580
or replace us?

41:32.682 --> 41:35.316
Perhaps the final outcome
will be determined

41:35.418 --> 41:36.984
by how ready we are

41:37.053 --> 41:39.120
to welcome them

41:39.188 --> 41:41.789
and how well we treat

41:41.858 --> 41:43.657
each other.

41:43.759 --> 41:46.861
One thing appears certain--

41:46.963 --> 41:51.232
mankind's very existence
hangs in the balance.

41:51.334 --> 41:54.969
And the time for answers
could be sooner...

41:55.037 --> 41:57.104
than we think.
