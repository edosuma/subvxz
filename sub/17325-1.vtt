01:04.680 --> 01:10.039
<i>It took the Earth's population</i>
<i>100,000 years to reach a billion people.</i>

01:10.640 --> 01:14.156
<i>And then just 100 more</i>
<i>to reach two billion.</i>

01:14.320 --> 01:16.596
<i>And only 50 years to double again.</i>

01:16.800 --> 01:21.033
<i>Four billion people in 1970.</i>
<i>We're nearly at eight billion now.</i>

01:21.360 --> 01:24.717
<i>We are destroying the very means</i>
<i>by which life is sustained.</i>

01:24.880 --> 01:27.156
<i>Every single global ill</i>
<i>that plagues the Earth...</i>

01:27.320 --> 01:30.358
<i>...can be traced back to human</i>
<i>overpopulation.</i>

01:31.320 --> 01:32.959
<i>Why do we demand inaction?</i>

01:33.120 --> 01:37.831
<i>We clear-cut. We dump.</i>
<i>We consume. We destroy.</i>

01:38.360 --> 01:42.752
<i>Half the animal species on Earth</i>
<i>have vanished...</i>

01:42.920 --> 01:44.639
<i>...in the last 40 years.</i>

01:44.800 --> 01:47.793
<i>But still we keep attacking</i>
<i>our own environment.</i>

01:48.000 --> 01:51.755
<i>Does it take a catastrophe</i>
<i>to learn our lesson? To get our attention?</i>

01:51.960 --> 01:53.360
<i>Nothing changes behavior like pain.</i>

01:55.080 --> 01:56.912
<i>Maybe pain can save us.</i>

02:03.360 --> 02:04.953
<i>There's a switch.</i>

02:07.120 --> 02:08.633
<i>If you throw it...</i>

02:10.479 --> 02:12.472
<i>...half the people on Earth will die.</i>

02:14.080 --> 02:15.355
<i>But if you don't...</i>

02:15.520 --> 02:18.718
<i>...the human race will be extinct</i>
<i>in a hundred years.</i>

02:20.480 --> 02:22.039
<i>What will you do?</i>

02:25.960 --> 02:30.591
<i>Mankind is the cancer in its own body.</i>

02:32.680 --> 02:35.354
<i>Do you love humanity enough to save it?</i>

02:37.120 --> 02:41.273
<i>In case they find me, I left you a path.</i>

02:42.200 --> 02:43.839
<i>The hardest one yet.</i>

02:45.360 --> 02:48.034
<i>Inferno will be at the end.</i>

02:48.760 --> 02:51.798
<i>You are my contingency plan.</i>

02:52.040 --> 02:55.078
<i>You are humanity's final hope.</i>

02:55.880 --> 02:58.475
<i>Make sure Inferno is unleashed.</i>

03:00.000 --> 03:01.354
<i>Seek and find.</i>

03:28.040 --> 03:29.440
Long road...

03:30.120 --> 03:31.554
...but here we are.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.633
Better me than the Americans.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.717
You're going to want to tell me
where it is.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.797
Yes, Mr. Bouchard.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.149
I know I will.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.637
<i>Tell them humanity is the disease.</i>

04:00.840 --> 04:02.593
<i>Inferno is the cure.</i>

04:40.040 --> 04:41.030
Traitors!

04:42.080 --> 04:44.311
<i>Suffer, sinners. Pay for your sins.</i>

04:47.880 --> 04:49.599
<i>Sinners, pay for your sins.</i>

04:51.520 --> 04:52.510
<i>Pay for your sins.</i>

04:52.680 --> 04:55.070
<i>Suffer, sinners. Pay for your sins.</i>

04:55.240 --> 04:57.516
<i>Ruin of souls.</i>

05:08.280 --> 05:10.237
- One moment, please.
- What is going...

05:10.440 --> 05:11.874
- What is happening?
- Dr. Brooks?

05:17.040 --> 05:19.032
<i>Abandon all hope.</i>

05:19.200 --> 05:20.350
<i>All hope.</i>

05:21.200 --> 05:22.919
<i>Sinners, pay for your sins.</i>

05:41.240 --> 05:44.312
Mr. Langdon, I'm Dr. Brooks.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.110
We're gonna do a few checks.
Nothing to worry about.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.111
We'll get rid of this, shall we?

05:58.520 --> 06:00.512
Do you know what day of the week it is?

06:01.520 --> 06:02.840
Saturday.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.711
It's Monday. 20th of June.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.357
Monday, the 20th of June.

06:09.920 --> 06:11.195
Do you know where we are?

06:12.720 --> 06:14.200
Boston.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.320
Mass General.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.234
And what's the last thing
you can remember?

06:26.560 --> 06:27.960
I was on campus.

06:31.320 --> 06:34.154
Everything is blurry. It's out of focus.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.359
Was I in some kind of an accident?

06:40.680 --> 06:41.796
We'll get to that.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.116
Is there someone we should call for you?

06:45.560 --> 06:46.755
No.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.116
Your wife? Family?

06:49.280 --> 06:52.273
No, no. I'm not married.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.355
Professor Langdon,
you're suffering from a head trauma.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.831
You appear to have
mild retrograde amnesia.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.070
We've done a CT scan.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.675
There's no evidence
of intracranial bleeding.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.400
Which is very reassuring, long-term.

07:06.560 --> 07:08.358
Just try to relax.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.679
Neurologically, you seem to be fine.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.114
Your memory will return
over the next several days.

07:14.280 --> 07:16.840
So we'll wait and watch.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.197
Can you turn off the lights, please?

07:21.280 --> 07:22.316
Of course.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.473
If the head trauma was bad enough
to cause cerebral contusions...

07:25.640 --> 07:28.030
- ...photosensitivity is common.
- Could you please turn off the lights?

07:31.800 --> 07:35.680
What am I doing in Florence?

07:37.280 --> 07:41.069
That's il Duomo.
That's the Palazzo Vecchio, isn't it?

07:41.760 --> 07:42.796
Yes.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.038
Well, how did I get here?

07:46.640 --> 07:50.316
You came to our emergency room
three hours ago with a head wound.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.031
Was I with a woman?

07:59.200 --> 08:01.032
No, a cab driver brought you in.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.198
No wallet, no phone, no ID.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.513
How the heck do you know my name?

08:09.640 --> 08:10.676
We've met.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.396
I saw you lecture at Imperial College
London. We spoke afterwards.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.674
You were very nice to me.

08:18.480 --> 08:19.630
We met?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.118
Sorry, that's not quite fair.
I was 9 at the time.

08:24.280 --> 08:28.115
- Wait, 9 years old?
- I was crazy about puzzles.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.078
And I liked your books.

08:32.760 --> 08:36.833
Maybe not <i>Lost Language of Ideograms.</i>
But the others.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.515
Okay.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.109
I read them all.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.600
What a weird kid.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.159
I was, actually.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.514
- Did I say that out loud?
- You did.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.554
I'm very sorry.

09:02.840 --> 09:06.675
Professor Langdon, the headaches
are going to be intense initially.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.590
And you can also expect nausea,
confusion and dizziness.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.557
That was the front desk.
The police are here to see you.

09:29.680 --> 09:30.909
Me? Why?

09:31.080 --> 09:34.960
Before you talk to them, professor,
you should know all the facts of your case.

09:35.120 --> 09:38.158
Your head wound wasn't caused by an
accident. It was the result of a gunshot.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.392
A bullet grazed the top of your skull,
and you most likely took a bad fall...

09:41.600 --> 09:42.875
...which is what caused the concussion.

09:43.120 --> 09:48.115
If the bullet had been an inch
to the side, it could've killed you.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.429
Come on, come on.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.276
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.959
Taxi!

11:21.360 --> 11:22.396
Get in!

11:27.040 --> 11:28.156
Is he drunk or what?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.395
What was that?

11:33.240 --> 11:34.469
Drive!

11:39.520 --> 11:40.715
Drive! Drive!

11:40.880 --> 11:43.793
- What's going on?
- No idea.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.794
This is gonna hurt.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.753
It's okay. It's okay.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.679
<i>Robert.</i>

12:00.600 --> 12:02.910
<i>Seek and find.</i>

12:35.560 --> 12:37.995
<i>Seek and find.</i>

12:50.200 --> 12:52.032
This is my apartment.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.193
You're still in Florence.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.592
- I'm gonna call the police.
- Wait up.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.760
A policewoman just tried to kill us.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.879
Okay. We'll call the U.S. Consulate
instead if you like.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.157
Just wait. Just give me...

13:10.320 --> 13:11.913
Give me a minute.

13:12.520 --> 13:13.670
Get a hold of things.

13:13.840 --> 13:15.911
Why was someone shooting at you?

13:16.440 --> 13:17.920
I don't know.

13:18.120 --> 13:21.670
Also, when you came into E.R., you were
mumbling something over and over.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.277
<i>Very sorry. Very sorry.</i>

13:25.800 --> 13:27.757
<i>Very, very sorry.</i>

13:28.800 --> 13:30.439
"Very sorry"?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.356
Do you have any idea
why you'd be saying this?

13:40.520 --> 13:41.590
No.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.353
Why was someone shooting at you?

13:43.520 --> 13:47.116
You can keep asking me these questions,
lady, but I'm not gonna know the answers!

13:47.280 --> 13:48.794
My name's Sienna.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.118
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

13:55.680 --> 13:56.796
Hello.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.395
Hi.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.474
Just, you ask a lot of questions.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.916
Yeah, I'm feeling a tad vulnerable
right now.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.800
I'm with someone
other people want to shoot at.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.235
I'm sorry.

14:10.600 --> 14:14.276
Questions are important.
It'll help you recover.

14:15.280 --> 14:19.274
Can I ask you for a cup of...?

14:25.280 --> 14:28.114
Well, it's brown and it's hot...

14:28.360 --> 14:31.512
...and people drink it in the morning
for energy.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.311
- Tea.
- Tea. No! The other one.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.073
- Coffee.
- Coffee!

14:36.560 --> 14:38.597
Could I have a cup of coffee?

14:39.880 --> 14:40.870
Sure.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.115
Thank you.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.957
You are very organized.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.557
I like things tidy.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.119
Thank you for helping me at the hospital.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.112
That was very courageous.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.112
It was just reflexes.

15:03.720 --> 15:04.995
Very sorry.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.716
Very...

15:15.560 --> 15:16.880
...sorry.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.314
I'm having visions.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.598
It's the head trauma.

15:33.360 --> 15:36.114
You won't be able to trust
your own thoughts for a while.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.510
Saw a plague mask.

15:40.680 --> 15:45.038
It's the kind that medieval doctors
wore during the Black Death.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.873
You said something about that.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.871
You were talking in the cab.
It was mostly incoherent...

15:51.480 --> 15:53.358
...but I did hear the word "mask."

15:54.160 --> 15:55.640
Anything else?

15:56.280 --> 15:57.680
Bodies.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.117
And blood and fire...

16:01.120 --> 16:02.918
<i>...and hell.</i>

16:04.720 --> 16:06.473
And there's a woman.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.590
Yeah, there's a woman, and she seemed...

16:11.760 --> 16:13.319
<i>Seek and find.</i>

16:13.640 --> 16:16.360
It all seems so dangerous.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.796
Look, you gotta have somebody
we should call.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.315
I do?

16:21.640 --> 16:22.756
Why?

16:26.880 --> 16:30.317
Was I wearing my watch
when I was brought to the hospital?

16:30.480 --> 16:31.550
No.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.393
You weren't wearing a watch.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.240
It was important to me.

16:41.440 --> 16:43.159
It was a gift from my parents.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.118
Look, you should go ahead and clean up.

16:46.240 --> 16:50.120
Your clothes are covered in blood but I think
I've got something that might fit you.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.797
Once you get dressed,
we'll call the police, okay?

16:53.960 --> 16:55.189
No, no.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.114
The consulate.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.280
Right.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.960
The consulate.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.160
Coffee.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.669
Ignazio?

17:59.520 --> 18:03.958
"What we stole is safely hidden,
as am I. Paradise Twenty-five."

18:04.120 --> 18:07.158
"Now they're after me too."

18:10.480 --> 18:12.153
"Is safely hidden."

18:13.040 --> 18:14.076
"As am I."

18:15.760 --> 18:17.319
What we stole?

18:26.680 --> 18:27.716
Ignazio?

18:46.320 --> 18:48.516
I've left your things in the bathroom.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.600
Try these.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.434
Whose are they?

18:53.160 --> 18:54.389
A friend's.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.074
Does he live here?

18:56.280 --> 18:57.600
Sometimes.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.396
Sometimes, huh?

19:00.120 --> 19:01.679
You're being rude.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.992
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not like this.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.873
You kind of are.

19:56.440 --> 19:57.954
<i>I found this in my old jacket.</i>

20:00.120 --> 20:01.873
It's a bio tube.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.396
They're used to transport
dangerous substances.

20:05.320 --> 20:06.720
What are you doing with it?

20:06.880 --> 20:08.280
I have no idea.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.274
It's a high-end unit.

20:12.360 --> 20:13.510
Government issue.

20:14.440 --> 20:15.954
It's got thumbprint recognition:

20:16.440 --> 20:18.397
Security in case it's lost or stolen.

20:18.640 --> 20:23.192
Tubes like this can only be opened
by a specified individual.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.514
Well, it sure as hell isn't me.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.797
- Then why do you have it?
- I don't know.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.952
I'm getting the number for the consulate.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.992
No, please. Wait.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.277
I have waited. This isn't right.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.152
Why do you have it? Where did you get it?

20:37.320 --> 20:40.154
There is a simple way to find out
if this thing belongs to me.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.959
Either my thumb will open it, or it won't.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.793
Open it? Are you insane?

20:43.960 --> 20:47.032
If it's a viral agent,
will it be released if I open it?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.196
No.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.514
No, there'd be an inner sleeve.
Maybe even two.

20:54.280 --> 20:58.274
Before I put myself in anyone's hands,
I wanna know what this thing is...

20:59.200 --> 21:00.998
...and what I'm involved with.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.319
That makes sense, doesn't it?

21:04.240 --> 21:05.390
Yes.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.632
So we agree...

21:09.680 --> 21:11.194
...we're opening it.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.555
Well, that explains it. It is mine.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.960
This is a cylinder seal...

21:38.560 --> 21:39.710
...made of ivory.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.116
No.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.560
It's bone.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.230
Human.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.070
Three-headed, man-eating Satan.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.709
A common image from the Middle Ages.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.640
Associated with the Black Plague.

21:58.200 --> 22:00.157
The three gnashing mouths are symbolic...

22:00.320 --> 22:02.630
...of how effectively the plague
ate through the population.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.071
Yet you can't remember
the word for coffee.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.436
Explains my visions. Sort of.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.560
You hear that?

22:15.280 --> 22:17.112
This could be a Faraday pointer.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.951
So why this?

22:41.320 --> 22:42.993
It's Botticelli.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.072
It's his <i>Map of Hell.</i>

22:45.280 --> 22:48.318
He painted it as an illustration
of Dante's <i>Inferno.</i>

22:49.720 --> 22:51.951
I studied Dante when I was younger.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.073
Probably in kindergarten.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.356
I was a bit obsessed.

22:55.560 --> 22:59.793
Dante defined
our modern conception of hell.

22:59.960 --> 23:03.556
Our vision of it hasn't changed
since he defined it 700 years ago.

23:03.840 --> 23:08.869
Botticelli drew it
but Dante created hell as we know it.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.479
This is what I have been seeing.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.320
Torment.

23:15.080 --> 23:16.275
Sinners.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.393
Branded with letters.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.320
Liars covered with rashes.

23:22.040 --> 23:24.509
Soothsayers with their heads
ripped backwards.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.110
- Serpents.
- The punishment for thievery.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.873
<i>Suffer, sinners. Pay for your sins.</i>

23:32.040 --> 23:34.111
So you have no idea why you have this.

23:36.440 --> 23:38.352
I think maybe we call the consulate now.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.230
Right.

23:43.840 --> 23:44.956
<i>Professor Langdon?</i>

23:45.120 --> 23:46.520
Hello, yes.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.040
Speaking.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.398
<i>Thank heavens you're alive.</i>
<i>We've been looking for you.</i>

23:51.960 --> 23:53.360
You have?

23:53.720 --> 23:55.120
<i>Are you still in possession?</i>

23:57.440 --> 24:00.114
<i>Mr. Langdon, do you have the tube?</i>

24:00.560 --> 24:02.392
- Yes.
<i>- Where are you located?</i>

24:03.920 --> 24:06.515
<i>Professor, we can't help you</i>
<i>if we can't find you.</i>

24:07.960 --> 24:10.031
That's the consulate.
Now, how did they know?

24:10.200 --> 24:11.429
Because they know.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.275
What do we do?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.913
Tell them you're over there.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.476
- Hello?
<i>- Professor, we were cut off.</i>

24:30.640 --> 24:31.835
Yes, sorry.

24:32.000 --> 24:32.990
<i>Where are you located?</i>

24:33.200 --> 24:34.998
I am at a hotel.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.795
Pensione La Fiorentina.

24:37.960 --> 24:40.520
<i>Stay in your room.</i>
<i>We're sending someone now.</i>

24:40.840 --> 24:43.799
Well, I'll wait here. Room 39.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.676
Okay.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.156
We wait and see who they send.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.194
Langdon accessed his e-mail account...

24:57.360 --> 24:59.431
...from an unmasked LP address
here in Florence.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.711
- When?
- Seven minutes ago.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.520
Via Dolorosa, number 12. Apartment 3C.

25:04.680 --> 25:06.114
Via Dolorosa. How long?

25:06.280 --> 25:07.430
Twelve minutes.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.920
Go! I want that pointer back!

25:09.080 --> 25:10.799
And I want Langdon. Whatever it takes.

25:10.960 --> 25:12.758
Let's get him. Go, go, go. Now!

25:20.000 --> 25:21.912
Look at this. This is odd.

25:23.120 --> 25:25.510
This area here.
This is Dante's eighth level of hell.

25:25.680 --> 25:28.479
It's called the <i>Malebolge.</i>
It means evil ditches.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.040
There's ten of them.

25:30.440 --> 25:33.239
This letter "R," here...

25:33.480 --> 25:36.075
...is not in the original painting.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.515
It's been added.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.000
Here's another one.

25:40.280 --> 25:42.112
- Where?
- An "E."

25:42.880 --> 25:45.793
- On seducers whipped by demons.
- Here's a "C" on the cheek of a...

25:45.960 --> 25:49.510
A grafter. A con man
trapped in a river of boiling tar.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.876
- "V." "R."
- There.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.271
- "T."
- There. "A."

25:55.560 --> 25:59.156
What is that? I think that's text.
Is that in English?

25:59.680 --> 26:01.717
"The truth...

26:02.720 --> 26:04.996
...can be glimpsed only...

26:05.160 --> 26:06.514
...through the eyes of...

26:07.080 --> 26:08.070
...death.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.873
Zobrist."

26:15.920 --> 26:17.434
"Bertrand Zobrist...

26:17.800 --> 26:20.759
...American billionaire."
That must be nice.

26:21.320 --> 26:25.360
"Bioengineer notorious for radical views."

26:26.120 --> 26:27.634
Here he is.

26:30.280 --> 26:35.639
<i>It took the Earth's population</i>
<i>100,000 years to reach a billion people.</i>

26:36.720 --> 26:40.839
And then just a hundred more
to reach two billion.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.236
And only 50 years to double again...

26:44.120 --> 26:46.555
<i>...to four billion people in 1970.</i>

26:48.480 --> 26:51.473
We're nearly at eight billion now.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.917
<i>Bartlett gives the example of a beaker.</i>

26:56.920 --> 27:01.517
With a single bacterium in it, one
that divides and doubles every minute.

27:01.920 --> 27:05.596
If you place the first bacterium into
the beaker at 11:00...

27:05.760 --> 27:08.639
...and it's completely full by 12...

27:08.800 --> 27:12.840
...at what time is the beaker
still only half full?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.116
11:59.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.796
<i>That's what time it is for us.</i>

27:20.320 --> 27:24.314
In 40 years, 32 billion people...

27:24.520 --> 27:26.716
...will fight to survive.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.715
They'll fail.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.078
We're a minute to midnight.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.956
Every single global ill
that plagues the Earth...

27:37.120 --> 27:40.557
<i>...can be traced back</i>
<i>to human overpopulation.</i>

27:40.760 --> 27:44.310
<i>But serious birth control measures,</i>
<i>they don't stand a chance.</i>

27:45.120 --> 27:48.158
"Outrageous! Violation of my rights!"

27:48.320 --> 27:52.314
"Invasion of my privacy!"
"Don't tell me what to do!"

27:52.760 --> 27:56.549
<i>And still, we keep attacking</i>
<i>our own environment.</i>

27:56.720 --> 28:01.272
There have been five major extinctions...

28:01.440 --> 28:03.079
<i>...in the Earth's history...</i>

28:03.880 --> 28:08.352
...and unless we take bold,
immediate action...

28:08.760 --> 28:10.877
...the sixth extinction...

28:12.520 --> 28:14.159
...will be our own.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.872
We're a minute to midnight.

28:20.360 --> 28:24.274
- Looks like he's got a lot of followers.
- Yeah, from all over the world.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.433
He is compelling.

28:30.240 --> 28:34.439
"A two-year disappearance during which
some authorities feared Zobrist...

28:34.600 --> 28:38.230
...may have designed
an opportunistic viral pathogen."

28:38.880 --> 28:40.951
He created a plague.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.394
But why Dante?

28:45.720 --> 28:50.112
Why this map of hell? Is this supposed
to be a puzzle or a challenge?

28:50.280 --> 28:51.714
Or a suicide note.

28:53.320 --> 28:55.516
He killed himself three days ago.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.196
The levels.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.675
The levels are out of order.
That's what's been bothering me.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.870
The circles of hell have been rearranged.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.871
It's the same woman from the hospital.

29:16.240 --> 29:19.472
We can't stay here. And we certainly
can't trust the consulate.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.791
Flatterers adrift in excrement.
That's not right.

29:21.960 --> 29:24.111
If a plague exists, do you know
how many governments would want it?

29:24.320 --> 29:26.073
Clerical profiteers. Not there.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.590
- And what they'd do to get it?
- Sowers of discord there? No.

29:28.760 --> 29:29.830
A biological weapon?

29:30.440 --> 29:31.430
The letters.

29:34.640 --> 29:38.316
He has assigned a letter to each sin
and then changed their order.

29:38.480 --> 29:39.755
He's made an anagram.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.109
Yes! Anagram!

29:48.640 --> 29:49.630
Let's go.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.031
- I know another way out.
- E, C, R.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.477
If you have a phone, best leave it here.

30:01.040 --> 30:02.030
They might track it.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.955
Phone? I'm not even
wearing my own clothes.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.918
Good. Let's go.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.119
Robert Langdon. World Health Organization.

30:25.440 --> 30:26.760
V, R, O...

30:28.120 --> 30:33.354
Gotta rearrange these letters.
Over, code, covered, cat.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.078
I used to be good at this.

30:40.560 --> 30:41.676
<i>Cerca trova.</i>

30:42.960 --> 30:44.030
It's Italian.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.520
It means "seek and find."

30:47.080 --> 30:48.992
<i>"Cerca trova"?</i> Yes!

30:50.840 --> 30:52.877
I know why I am in Florence.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.760
<i>The World Health Organization</i>
<i>has landed. Stand by.</i>

31:06.560 --> 31:10.713
Be advised: Agent Bouchard
from the Paris office is already here.

31:16.160 --> 31:19.278
- W.H.O. Bring me up to speed.
- Bouchard is up there now.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.076
Where are we going?

31:45.240 --> 31:47.630
The Palazzo Vecchio.
Near the Boboli Gardens.

32:02.240 --> 32:05.711
There's no sign of them. Bouchard says
Langdon is gone and so is the pointer.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.600
Well, I need better.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.514
I need better from you, from you,
from all of us.

32:10.880 --> 32:11.950
Better!

32:12.320 --> 32:16.109
Work faster. Work smarter.
Don't trust anyone!

32:17.400 --> 32:18.754
Let's do that.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.595
- Yes, ma'am. Let's travel.
- Yes.

32:34.480 --> 32:35.755
We may be compromised.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.357
Tell her people nothing. Understood?

32:43.440 --> 32:44.510
<i>Identification?</i>

32:44.680 --> 32:45.909
Vayentha.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.190
<i>Go ahead.</i>

32:47.400 --> 32:49.153
I need to speak to the provost.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.635
<i>Hold on.</i>

32:55.160 --> 32:59.518
...transfer of £400,000 to Zurich
account number 0883011.

32:59.800 --> 33:02.679
So the W.H.O. beat you to Mr. Langdon,
Vayentha.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.760
Provost isn't going to like that.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.156
I know him.
He's going to want to liquidate.

33:07.320 --> 33:10.996
Tell him this isn't Berlin.
He tries anything and I will find him.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.398
Try to reacquire and make contact
in 60 minutes.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.552
Did you hear me? I am not disposable.

33:16.760 --> 33:20.356
<i>Vayentha, get the Faraday pointer</i>
<i>before the government does.</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:23.195
Shit.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.877
Mr. Sims. There's been a deviation.

33:50.240 --> 33:52.391
Sorry to hear that. What operation?

33:52.560 --> 33:55.837
Florence. Our new player
seems to have gone off-script.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.440
How unprofessional.

33:59.760 --> 34:04.710
And now the W.H.O.
has overtaken our position.

34:09.440 --> 34:13.797
Tell Vayentha if she values her position,
she will remove Langdon.

34:13.960 --> 34:14.996
Body not found.

34:16.320 --> 34:18.596
Better yet, a mugging gone awry.

34:18.760 --> 34:22.436
A blade, I think.
Cash gone, wallet remains.

34:22.600 --> 34:26.275
Let's have a quick identification
and move on. Move on. Move on.

34:28.639 --> 34:31.235
Professor Langdon is out of frame.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.154
And in possession of the tube?

34:39.360 --> 34:42.717
Yes. He has the Faraday pointer.

34:46.920 --> 34:50.800
It was such a good frame.
What is Vayentha's condition?

34:51.199 --> 34:53.032
Intact, but anxious.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.554
She should be.

34:58.880 --> 35:02.191
What in God's name
has this client gotten us into?

35:02.360 --> 35:05.319
No, no, no. It is rhetorical.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.071
When are we due
to receive the client's video?

35:11.600 --> 35:15.150
It just arrived. His instructions
are to upload it in 24 hours.

35:15.320 --> 35:16.515
I want to look at it now.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.080
But the client, Mr. Zobrist...

35:18.360 --> 35:21.671
The client is dead.
I want to see the video.

35:21.840 --> 35:24.912
That's a violation of our protocols.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.313
We are not the government.
We get things done.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.439
Mr. Arbogast...

35:35.200 --> 35:39.274
...chief among the attributes
that makes us so very good at our job...

35:39.440 --> 35:42.717
...is that, as far as the world
is concerned, we don't exist.

35:43.240 --> 35:46.711
If this video implicates
or even mentions us in any way...

35:46.880 --> 35:50.237
...I want to stop its release
for the benefit of all our clients.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.274
You asked me to avoid abnormalities
in procedure, that's all.

35:53.440 --> 35:57.559
What about Mr. Zobrist
has ever remotely resembled normal?

35:57.720 --> 36:00.394
- Well, I...
- Also rhetorical.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.199
Bring me the video.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.119
In the Palazzo's Hall of Five Hundred,
there's a famous mural:

36:08.280 --> 36:10.351
Giorgio Vasari's <i>Battle of Marciano.</i>

36:10.560 --> 36:12.836
Near the top of the mural
is a coded message.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.992
It's one of the art world's
most famous puzzles.

36:15.160 --> 36:16.276
And what's the message?

36:16.480 --> 36:17.994
<i>Cerca trova.</i>

36:18.880 --> 36:19.916
Seek and find.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.915
And at the hospital,
when I kept saying I was sorry...

36:23.080 --> 36:25.640
- Very sorry. Over and over.
- Maybe that's not what I meant.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.520
The name of the artist, Vasari.
I could have been saying "Vasari."

36:28.680 --> 36:31.036
That's good. You seem clearer.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.270
Yeah. I am.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.033
What's your middle name?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.398
Well, I am. I am.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.955
Zobrist is dead,
but if his plague is real...

36:42.320 --> 36:46.951
...then this map, it's a trail
he has left so someone can find it.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.196
Who?

36:48.960 --> 36:51.714
Well, someone who believes
the same as he does.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.030
And that's why you have it?

36:53.200 --> 36:56.796
- I don't remember ever meeting Zobrist.
- There's a lot you don't remember.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.554
Maybe they...

36:58.720 --> 37:02.839
Maybe they came to you.
Wanted your help with the path.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.435
- Because I lecture on Dante?
- Exactly.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.718
They'd show you this Faraday pointer,
try to convince you of their cause.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.590
- Mass murder?
- You said you found him compelling.

37:11.760 --> 37:15.834
His argument, his rhetoric, not this plan.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.435
Zobrist is a psychopath.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.718
Well, maybe they tricked you.
Sent someone you knew.

37:21.960 --> 37:23.917
<i>It's a minute to midnight.</i>

37:31.320 --> 37:33.676
- Is that for us?
- Logic would suggest.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.430
Damn it!

37:51.800 --> 37:55.032
Here, come on. Follow me.
We can get there through the garden.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.794
Okay, the Palazzo Vecchio is this way.

38:11.960 --> 38:15.670
We just flagged a car charged to
her credit card within the past hour.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.559
Antoine, did you speak to the police?

38:17.720 --> 38:19.757
Someone saw them running in the park.

38:19.920 --> 38:23.630
Tell the local police that the W.H.O.
needs their full cooperation.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.919
Airspace over Boboli Gardens
is under W.H.O. command.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.391
Send in the canine units.

38:39.320 --> 38:43.951
I'm from Uffizi Station.
Commander is sending reinforcements.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.231
Get more officers in there now.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.599
<i>Command one to dispatch.</i>
<i>Suspects in sight.</i>

39:25.240 --> 39:28.074
Dammit!
Delta, check the stairs to the north.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.319
There's a small gray door down here.

39:32.480 --> 39:36.190
It'll take us through to the Vasari Corridor,
right across the Ponte Vecchio...

39:36.360 --> 39:38.238
...into the Palazzo.

39:38.640 --> 39:40.074
That's the door. See?

39:40.240 --> 39:41.276
Now!

39:55.600 --> 39:57.910
Grotto sector clear.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.634
Is the garden completely walled?

39:59.800 --> 40:04.033
On all sides. The only exits are through
the Palazzo Pitti on the north side...

40:04.200 --> 40:06.431
...and through the visitors' gates
on the east and the west sides.

40:06.800 --> 40:07.836
No other way out?

40:08.000 --> 40:12.552
I suppose if you count the Vasari Gate.
But it's ancient. No one knows about it.

40:12.760 --> 40:13.750
Langdon does.

40:14.160 --> 40:16.800
<i>Double back</i>
<i>and take position over Vasari Corridor.</i>

40:19.280 --> 40:21.511
<i>I repeat: Vasari Corridor.</i>

40:22.720 --> 40:25.360
<i>The professor has become a liability,</i>
<i>Vayentha.</i>

40:25.520 --> 40:29.958
The provost has issued a kill order.
Eliminate Langdon.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.432
<i>Fail and you will be held accountable.</i>

40:32.760 --> 40:34.399
<i>Am I making myself clear?</i>

40:34.640 --> 40:36.199
Copy that, sir.

40:54.280 --> 40:57.034
There. That's the Vasari fresco.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.271
<i>The Battle of Marciano.</i>

41:37.960 --> 41:38.996
<i>There. There.</i>

41:39.320 --> 41:40.834
Look, look, look.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.556
Okay, see the two farmhouses?
Dead center, up high.

41:44.840 --> 41:48.993
Come down to its four o'clock,
and you'll see a small green flag.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.312
<i>- "Cerca trova."</i>
- Yeah.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.789
"Seek and find."

41:54.280 --> 41:55.475
<i>Seek and find.</i>

41:55.800 --> 41:58.031
We sought it and we found it.

41:58.360 --> 41:59.953
So now what?

42:00.320 --> 42:02.551
The words Zobrist added to the painting:

42:02.760 --> 42:06.310
"The truth can be glimpsed
only through the eyes of death."

42:08.080 --> 42:09.355
Eyes of death...

42:10.720 --> 42:12.279
Whose eyes?

42:52.120 --> 42:53.600
Was I given an injection?

42:53.840 --> 42:54.956
When?

42:55.160 --> 42:57.197
At the hospital, with a hypodermic?

42:57.360 --> 43:00.512
No. You were intubated.
Anything you got came through the IV.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.953
Not at the hospital.

43:04.600 --> 43:05.795
I was fully dressed.

43:05.960 --> 43:09.920
I was in the back of some car
at some point in the last two days.

43:10.240 --> 43:12.835
And something was injected
into my bloodstream...

43:13.000 --> 43:15.310
...and now I'm showing signs
of an illness.

43:18.120 --> 43:19.600
What if...?

43:21.160 --> 43:22.560
What if what?

43:24.920 --> 43:27.116
Sienna, what if I'm the carrier?

43:28.880 --> 43:29.996
Look...

43:31.320 --> 43:33.880
...if you've got it,
then I've got it, too...

43:34.040 --> 43:37.670
...and everyone we've come
into contact with has it and will likely die.

43:37.880 --> 43:38.870
But if you don't...

43:39.040 --> 43:43.432
...if they gave you a narcotic
or an hallucinogen or anything else...

43:43.960 --> 43:46.794
...then we still have a chance
to save half the world.

43:48.520 --> 43:49.795
It's worth a try, isn't it?

43:59.560 --> 44:00.596
Professor.

44:02.880 --> 44:05.998
It is you. You're back so soon.

44:07.080 --> 44:09.311
I have no idea who this woman is.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.793
I almost didn't recognize you
in that suit. You've been shopping?

44:15.920 --> 44:17.673
Professor, you bumped your head?

44:18.200 --> 44:21.637
In the shower, yes. Yes.
It was quite a tumble.

44:23.520 --> 44:26.479
I'm sorry, this is Sienna, my niece.

44:27.160 --> 44:30.597
You're in Italy, professor.
You don't have to say "niece."

44:30.960 --> 44:32.599
- No, it's not...
- No, he's not...

44:33.800 --> 44:35.712
Marta Alvarez. Pleasure to meet you.

44:37.080 --> 44:38.434
Is Ignazio with you again?

44:39.920 --> 44:41.320
Ignazio?

44:51.240 --> 44:53.755
Ignazio couldn't make it this morning.

44:53.960 --> 44:57.670
I'm sorry to bother you, Marta...

44:58.120 --> 45:03.434
...but I can imagine you know
why I'm back again.

45:04.120 --> 45:05.349
Really?

45:05.960 --> 45:08.270
Of all the treasures in the Palazzo.

45:08.920 --> 45:13.073
He and <i>il Duomino</i> spent almost an hour
with it up there last night.

45:13.320 --> 45:15.755
It's so morbid.

45:16.440 --> 45:19.672
No. No. It's cool.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.715
All right. Come on,
I'm headed up that way.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.719
He's an extremely resourceful man.

45:32.280 --> 45:34.715
I was told you were as well, Mr. Bouchard.

45:38.640 --> 45:40.438
So tell me:

45:40.840 --> 45:43.799
- What do you think he's doing?
- What do you think you are doing?

45:43.960 --> 45:46.794
I brought you the pointer,
and now it's gone. You have a leak.

45:46.960 --> 45:50.431
We lose him in the street,
reacquire him at the doctor's apartment...

45:50.640 --> 45:53.280
I can handle boots on the ground.
We don't need your help.

45:53.440 --> 45:54.760
What if he's injured?

45:55.960 --> 45:57.280
A head wound?

45:57.520 --> 46:00.240
What, you think he's confused?
Doesn't know what he's doing?

46:00.440 --> 46:01.840
It's possible.

46:02.000 --> 46:04.993
How far did he get that night,
before he disappeared?

46:05.560 --> 46:07.199
To the Hall of Five Hundred.

46:09.280 --> 46:11.158
So let's stop chasing him.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.478
Anticipate him instead.

46:26.760 --> 46:28.797
Not so fast. Please.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.918
I'm about to burst.

46:31.120 --> 46:34.955
It's such a romantic date
he takes you on, to see a death mask.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.277
They were common practice in the 1500s.

46:37.480 --> 46:41.190
It's essentially just a plaster cast
of someone's face...

46:41.400 --> 46:43.960
...made a few moments
after that person dies.

46:44.880 --> 46:46.394
"Through the eyes of death."

46:46.560 --> 46:48.916
Whose face was used for this mask?

46:49.080 --> 46:51.640
The poet, Dante.

46:54.040 --> 46:56.430
It is a romantic story, I suppose.

46:56.600 --> 47:00.435
Dante loved Florence.
He was prominent and powerful...

47:00.600 --> 47:03.354
...but the political winds changed
and he was exiled.

47:03.520 --> 47:06.399
They threatened to burn him
at the stake if he ever returned.

47:06.760 --> 47:09.798
Actually, some people say Dante's exile...

47:09.960 --> 47:12.839
...is the reason
his death mask looks so sad.

47:13.000 --> 47:16.755
No. No, it was because of Beatrice.

47:17.120 --> 47:21.080
Dante only knew her from afar, but
he was obsessed with her his entire life.

47:21.960 --> 47:24.395
Your niece is a romantic, professor.

47:25.520 --> 47:30.037
They say Dante wrote <i>Inferno</i>
about his journey out of hell to reach her.

47:30.240 --> 47:31.799
But he never made it.

47:32.760 --> 47:34.717
She married someone else.

47:35.240 --> 47:36.879
That happens.

47:37.200 --> 47:38.350
Does it?

47:38.960 --> 47:40.440
Who left who?

47:40.720 --> 47:42.996
Things fall apart
if you don't look after them.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.672
Oh, we ask that you stay
behind the stanchions, please.

47:46.880 --> 47:47.950
Thank you.

47:48.120 --> 47:50.271
Good timing, professor.
We've only just opened.

47:55.800 --> 47:57.359
Marta.

48:33.480 --> 48:35.790
- There. That's us.
- Let it play from here.

48:39.280 --> 48:40.430
That's Ignazio Busoni.

48:41.520 --> 48:44.718
I've known him for years.
He's the Dante scholar.

48:46.920 --> 48:49.799
The mask's owner insists
on the stanchions to keep people back.

48:51.560 --> 48:54.234
He doesn't even permit staff
to open the case without him present.

48:54.400 --> 48:57.199
So the mask is not owned by the museum?

48:57.360 --> 49:01.115
No. A private collector bought it from us
and allows us to display it in perpetuity.

49:01.560 --> 49:04.917
It's common practice to raise funds.

49:05.880 --> 49:06.916
Who is the collector?

49:07.160 --> 49:10.039
Bertrand Zobrist. The billionaire.

49:10.640 --> 49:14.919
His ideas were quite eccentric, but still,
it's such a shame what happened.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.073
That's where I got the call.

49:49.200 --> 49:51.715
Professor, I don't know what to say.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.116
I'm appalled.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.790
Professor Langdon.

50:07.120 --> 50:09.476
Look, there's an explanation
for all of this.

50:11.960 --> 50:14.839
It's the carabinieri.
They're setting off the metal detectors.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.400
Who are the others?

50:16.560 --> 50:17.880
Government agents.

50:20.040 --> 50:21.554
We have an intrusion.

50:22.920 --> 50:23.956
I'll be right back.

50:24.160 --> 50:26.994
Marta, stay in this room.
We'll be right outside.

50:28.800 --> 50:31.110
They can't bring loaded weapons in here.

50:44.120 --> 50:47.557
- Professor, I very much respect you...
- Marta.

50:47.720 --> 50:49.279
- ...but I do not understand...
- Please.

50:49.480 --> 50:50.550
- ...why you have done this.
- Please sit down.

50:50.720 --> 50:53.110
- I'm going to explain this to you.
- This is not okay.

50:53.320 --> 50:54.549
I do not know where that mask is.

50:54.720 --> 50:58.111
But I will do everything I can
to find it and return it to you.

50:58.320 --> 51:00.277
What are you doing?! Professor, please!

51:00.440 --> 51:02.511
Professor, come back here!
You can't do that!

51:02.880 --> 51:04.360
Professor, please don't.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.598
- Professor!
- Just don't follow us.

51:06.760 --> 51:08.274
Please! Don't do this.

51:10.560 --> 51:11.550
Professor!

51:17.080 --> 51:18.150
Parker.

51:20.240 --> 51:23.153
Let's just calmly find a way out of here.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.509
Why didn't you tell me about Ignazio?

51:31.040 --> 51:32.872
Would you have helped me
if you knew I was a thief?

51:33.280 --> 51:36.273
- You lied to me when you asked my help.
- Well, technically, I withheld.

51:40.600 --> 51:43.752
- If I really took that mask...
- You did take the mask. I just saw you.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.719
This is not your problem.
You don't have to stay.

51:47.480 --> 51:48.709
Of course I do.

51:48.880 --> 51:52.271
Human lives are at stake. I just want
to know that I'm on the right side.

51:52.440 --> 51:53.476
You are.

51:54.440 --> 51:55.715
I swear.

51:56.280 --> 51:59.876
Good. Then let's find
what we're looking for.

52:00.640 --> 52:03.474
Call this Ignazio and ask him
where he hid the mask.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.236
Ignazio's disappeared. Gone into hiding.

52:12.960 --> 52:16.749
He said they were chasing him, too,
but he left a clue.

52:19.600 --> 52:22.240
An e-mail. "Paradise Twenty-five."

52:22.400 --> 52:25.120
That's a reference to Dante's
<i>Divine Comedy,</i> Canto XXV.

52:25.280 --> 52:26.794
But I need a copy of the book.

52:26.960 --> 52:29.555
Copy of the book? That's quaint.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.393
I use Google.

52:31.560 --> 52:34.758
They're closing down the museum.
Only the main exit's gonna be open.

52:35.240 --> 52:37.835
Well, then we will go through Armenia.

52:44.280 --> 52:47.671
<i>Please move in an orderly fashion</i>
<i>through the main gate.</i>

53:04.240 --> 53:07.756
All exit doors are now sealed.
This is the only way in or out.

53:07.920 --> 53:11.118
What about hidden exits? Tunnels?
Concealed doorways?

53:11.280 --> 53:15.035
It's a 700-year-old palazzo, <i>signore.</i>
There are a number of them.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.554
Show me.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.314
Armenia.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.956
Professor. How worldly.

53:44.120 --> 53:45.759
"Secrets of the Palazzo Invisible."

53:45.920 --> 53:48.480
It's a great tour,
you should take it some time.

53:50.120 --> 53:51.839
We should be safe here for a minute.

53:59.040 --> 54:00.076
Go.

54:04.920 --> 54:07.230
"By then with other voice,
with other fleece...

54:07.400 --> 54:11.679
...I shall return as poet and put on at
my baptismal font, the laurel crown."

54:11.840 --> 54:12.876
Baptismal font.

54:13.040 --> 54:15.509
Il Duomo. The cathedral
where Dante was baptized.

54:15.680 --> 54:19.390
That's where Ignazio works.
It's where he hid the mask.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.120
This area's clear!

54:25.320 --> 54:27.630
They're gonna think
we're headed down to the exit.

54:29.640 --> 54:30.756
Then we go up.

54:47.960 --> 54:49.110
All right.

54:51.480 --> 54:54.120
We're right above
the Hall of Five Hundred.

54:54.280 --> 54:57.876
There's a stairway leading
down to the street on the other side.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.037
So one step at a time, huh?

55:10.960 --> 55:11.996
Okay.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.680
You afraid of heights?

55:17.440 --> 55:18.510
A little.

55:18.880 --> 55:21.190
I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.

55:22.680 --> 55:24.353
So don't look down.

55:24.520 --> 55:25.590
Or do.

55:25.800 --> 55:27.200
I can never remember which.

56:01.440 --> 56:02.430
Yeah, yeah.

56:04.680 --> 56:05.909
It's not that hard.

56:15.360 --> 56:16.555
Come on. Good.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.430
Sienna!

56:32.720 --> 56:34.439
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

56:34.600 --> 56:35.829
You okay?

56:36.120 --> 56:39.238
All right, just crawl
along that beam there...

56:39.400 --> 56:42.074
...and I'll meet you on the far side,
by the ladder.

56:49.520 --> 56:50.670
Sir.

56:50.880 --> 56:53.873
Give me six men stationed here.
Safeties off.

57:04.680 --> 57:07.149
You're being stupid now,
Professor Langdon.

57:08.200 --> 57:10.431
Go, go. Get out of here. Go!

57:13.560 --> 57:16.553
They needed you,
but now they've changed their minds.

57:49.760 --> 57:50.910
Get these people out!

57:51.080 --> 57:52.639
Everyone out! Clear the room!

58:07.080 --> 58:08.400
Give me that.

58:11.200 --> 58:12.634
These doors. Here.

58:13.160 --> 58:15.311
Eastern side. That's where they're headed.

58:15.840 --> 58:17.354
Go, move! Quick!

59:08.120 --> 59:10.589
<i>Bouchard? Agent Bouchard, come in.</i>

59:12.920 --> 59:14.798
<i>What is your location?</i>

59:14.960 --> 59:16.474
<i>Agent Bouchard, come in.</i>

59:19.280 --> 59:21.875
That same word is on the envelope
the video arrived in.

59:23.240 --> 59:25.550
Along with the date.
That date is tomorrow.

59:25.720 --> 59:29.157
Well, thank you. That was not lost on me.

59:30.640 --> 59:32.359
<i>The darkest places in hell...</i>

59:32.520 --> 59:36.275
<i>...are reserved for those who refuse</i>
<i>to act in time of crisis.</i>

59:37.400 --> 59:41.519
<i>Dante's hell isn't fiction anymore.</i>
<i>It's prophecy.</i>

59:42.040 --> 59:44.794
<i>We have created our own hell on Earth.</i>

59:45.400 --> 59:46.880
Oh, my.

59:47.040 --> 59:50.351
<i>The warnings have been obvious,</i>
<i>the solutions ignored.</i>

59:50.560 --> 59:52.517
<i>So I took action.</i>

59:52.920 --> 59:54.274
<i>If you're watching this...</i>

59:54.480 --> 59:58.360
<i>...it means the Inferno virus</i>
<i>was released last night at midnight...</i>

59:58.520 --> 01:00:02.400
<i>...and is now being carried</i>
<i>to every corner of the Earth.</i>

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.153
Oh, my.

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.437
<i>Within six days of its release...</i>

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.879
<i>...the virus will replicate itself</i>
<i>in every man, woman and child on Earth.</i>

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.639
<i>Expect the current...</i>

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.030
<i>The current population</i>
<i>to be culled by half.</i>

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.553
<i>The survivors will witness...</i>

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.239
<i>...horrors...</i>

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.911
<i>...unknown to this planet.</i>

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:30.116
<i>But I want them to know why.</i>

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.078
<i>That this was our doing.</i>

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.960
<i>And this is our salvation.</i>

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.680
<i>Now is the time.</i>

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.516
<i>Today is...</i>

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.550
There's more.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.552
I believe I've got the gist.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.239
It appears our organization
has spent the last several years...

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.834
...in the employ of a madman...

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.793
...who now intends
to commit a mass murder...

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.071
...using a deadly plague
of his own creation...

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.072
...at some point in the next 24... Sorry.

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.992
Less than 12 hours.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.110
So let's do our level best
not to fuck things up any worse...

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.795
...than we already have, shall we?

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.992
Without the Faraday pointer,
no one can find the virus.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.880
Where's Professor Langdon now?

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.477
He was with Dr. Brooks in the Boboli
Gardens, but we seem to have lost visual.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.355
And I'm afraid we've had
no contact from Vayentha.

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.795
I see.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.672
I'm going to Florence myself.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.590
Test her for signs of contagion
and quarantine this place.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.873
If we don't find Langdon very soon...

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.839
...we're going to be looking
at a great many more dead bodies.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.430
Are you all right?

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.789
It's weakness. Just weakness, goddamn it.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.994
We'll just take a moment.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.153
Did you see her down there?

01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.236
Yes.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.552
Everything I've done, every bit of work
and study since I was 11...

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.353
...was to stop death, not cause it.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:28.716
It was self-defense.
That woman was trying to kill us.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.791
I don't know if I can finish this.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.840
I understand if you can't.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.438
Look, Zobrist is the murderer, not you.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.629
You saved me.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.951
You don't have to take another step.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.034
No, you're right.

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.478
I did what was necessary,
and I'll do it again if I need to.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.319
I pray that you don't.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.115
Looks like it's closed for repairs.

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.278
Okay, this way.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.315
There.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.437
The baptismal font.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.634
Dante again. Always Dante. Why Dante?

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.995
Acrylic gesso.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.471
- What, you mean paint?
- Water-soluble paint.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.514
Smells like a wet dog.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.595
Look at that. There's writing.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.119
"Seek the treacherous doge of Venice...

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.793
...who severed the heads from horses."

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.155
Venice.

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:34.117
Where Dante was infected
with the disease that killed him.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:40.031
"Kneel within the gilded museum
of holy wisdom...

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.399
...and listen for the sounds...

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.199
...of trickling water.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:53.630
Deep into the sunken palace where the...

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.231
...chthonic monster waits."

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.472
The plague itself. Underwater.

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:05.040
"Submerged in the blood-red waters...

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.592
...of the lagoon that reflects no stars."

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:14.836
Professor.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.555
Could you please tell me
what the hell you're doing?

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.950
- Why haven't you called in?
- Who are you?

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.194
Christoph Bouchard.
From the World Health Organization.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.950
- We've met.
- We've met?

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.432
You really don't remember?
It was just two days ago.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.751
He's suffering the effects
of a head wound.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.719
He can't remember the events
of the last 48 hours.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.199
I'm the one who flew to Cambridge
and asked for your help.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.871
I gave you the pointer to decode.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.391
- Professor Langdon?
- Yes?

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.514
<i>Okay, yeah. Yeah.</i>

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.273
I remember.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.516
Who are you?

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.758
I was the ER doctor at the hospital
when the professor came in.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.797
What is the last thing you remember?

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:08.078
I was on the street. I think it was here.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.600
I was with a woman.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.318
- And I was given an injection.
- Elizabeth Sinskey.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.830
Elizabeth?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.673
<i>From the World Health Organization.</i>

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.274
Do you know her?

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.077
I do. But I haven't seen Elizabeth
in years.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.274
- She's the reason I followed you alone.
- What do you mean?

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:31.638
I believe Dr. Sinskey's working
with a foreign government...

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.399
...to find and sell the virus.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.791
No, no, no. That's not possible.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.519
People change, professor.

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.280
I've been chasing Bertrand Zobrist
for two years...

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.672
...and someone has been working
against me.

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.272
Let's get to the point.
Do you know where the virus is?

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:52.040
I assume you have
some sort of credentials.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.754
Call the W.H.O. if you like.
Check me out. But do it quickly.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.719
Venice. We think it's Venice.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.677
Good. It's two hours by train. Come on.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.400
If I could find you, so can the others.

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:13.917
I'm buying you both plane tickets
to Geneva.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.549
No, not Geneva, he said Venice.

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:17.989
I heard that.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.872
Excuse us. Please watch yourselves.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.600
Step back, please. Excuse us.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.995
Excuse us.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.753
Watch yourselves, please.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.274
This is the plane to Geneva?

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.392
Yes, but we just closed the doors.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.473
Keep the plane at the gate.
We need to check every passenger.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.552
That will be a waste of time.

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:42.433
And we have very little of that.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.477
Three days ago, after two years
of searching, I found Zobrist.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.997
<i>He killed himself, but we took</i>
<i>a package from his pocket.</i>

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.350
And what was in it?

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.319
The Faraday pointer with the <i>Map of Hell.</i>

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:09.713
A puzzle. Specifically designed
for his follower to solve.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.600
We brought it to you.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:15.037
And we were in the process of decoding it
when you were kidnapped.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.432
Professor Langdon.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.957
You were with Dr. Sinskey at the time.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.640
Elizabeth, yes.

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.272
Did she tell you about any
third-party interest in the virus?

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.229
I don't remember.

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:38.880
Did she have financial problems?

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.189
I don't know.

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:42.555
- Did she carry more than one cell phone?
- I don't know.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:43.750
- Think!
- He doesn't remember.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.071
Millions of people will die, professor.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.469
I don't have time for this bullshit.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.433
"I don't know, I don't remember."

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.073
Stop. You're not helping him.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.952
"The gilded museum," is that Saint Mark's?

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:57.238
All of Venice is a museum.

01:08:57.439 --> 01:09:01.399
Saint Mark's has the <i>Horses of</i>
<i>Constantinople.</i> They're bronze statues.

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.790
Can I see that?

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.790
I wouldn't touch it.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.118
I wasn't planning on it.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.240
Professor?

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.990
Professor Langdon? Professor Langdon?

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.439
Professor Langdon.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.319
Yes?

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.634
Hello, Robert.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.514
Elizabeth.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.872
It's been a long time.

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:46.760
Too long.

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:50.919
What brings you here?

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.355
The W.H.O. needs your help.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.350
My help?

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.637
I hope you still remember your Dante.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.795
What just happened?

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.599
Are you all right?

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:15.229
Could you get some water?
He could be dehydrated.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.752
Some food. Maybe some fruit,
or something from the machine?

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:20.915
- Quickly.
- Sure.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.356
Thank you.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.037
- Is he lying?
- Through his teeth.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.874
He was not the one
that came to Cambridge to see me.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.634
Bouchard, I need help.
Quickly. I think he's collapsed.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.515
He's in there. I can't open the door.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.716
Langdon.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.150
Are you okay?

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.597
<i>- Toilet occupied.</i>
- Langdon, are you okay?

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.954
Come on, let's go!

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.279
You're telling me that, for two years...

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.114
...you and your organization
have been working against me?

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.630
That is correct.

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.031
To shield Bertrand Zobrist
and his research?

01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.192
To hide him, to protect him?

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.629
Regrettably, yes.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:50.795
And that all of my attempts to prevent him
from initiating a worldwide pandemic...

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.235
...have failed because of you?

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:55.396
Incisive sum-up, yes.

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.995
Now you have the temerity to ask...

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:01.312
...that I simply decide to trust you?

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.834
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't see any other way.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.553
Who, exactly, does your group work for?

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.358
Our clients, of course.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.429
We are a private security firm.
A very successful one.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.439
May I ask...

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.630
...the gentleman who was with you,
Agent Bouchard...

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.515
...where is he now?

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.716
We don't know. We lost track of him.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.551
Then the situation is worse
than you think.

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.475
There's only one reason
he would move out of pocket.

01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.359
He wants Mr. Langdon to himself.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:43.676
Why?

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.918
To find the virus and sell it
to the highest bidder, I assume.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.914
Leverage, blackmail.
You know, the usual shit.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:53.118
I don't think we have anything further
to discuss, Mr. Sims.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.432
And I have less than eight hours
to find this pathogen. Excuse me.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:00.520
From what I understand,
you knew the professor some time ago.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:03.915
Personally.

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.639
You care about him.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.878
You would even ally with an unscrupulous
character such as myself to protect him.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.394
Wouldn't you?

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.950
My organization has the resources
to find your professor.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.320
If you wanted to start a plague,
this is where you'd do it.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.916
Yeah.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.838
20 million people a year come here
from every corner of the globe.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.635
During the Black Death...

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:05.192
...the Venetians made all the ships anchor
in the harbor for 40 days...

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.477
...before they would allow
the crews into the city.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.109
Making sure that they were not carrying
the plague.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:14.593
The word "quarantine" comes from
the Italian <i>"quaranta."</i> Forty.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.791
It's nice to have you back, professor.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.316
There.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.440
The horses.

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:32.909
These are recreations. The originals
are in a museum for preservation.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.879
We should be quick.
Bouchard knows we're coming here.

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.915
Ask that guide if the heads have
ever been severed from these horses.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.357
According to the tale,
during the Crusades...

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.796
...the horses were looted
from Constantinople.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.999
But they were too large
to be loaded on board the ships.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.591
So their heads were removed
and then reattached.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.035
By whom?

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:23.313
- Enrico Dandolo.
- The doge who lived forever.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.554
Of course, Enrico Dandolo.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.076
Dandolo tricked the Venetians
into the Crusades.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:29.993
He was supposed to sail
his ships to Egypt...

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.277
...but he sacked Constantinople instead.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.633
I'm sorry. Of course.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.396
"The gilded museum of holy wisdom."

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.553
Are we in the wrong basilica?

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.274
We're in the wrong country.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:46.160
Dandolo ruled Venice,
but he was not buried here.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:49.040
- So where was he buried?
- Hagia Sophia.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.717
- Istanbul.
- Istanbul.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.435
There's always a way out.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.110
Here, here.

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.717
Let's see if we can get that open.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.996
I'll give you a hand.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.350
I got your foot.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.000
Can you get it?

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.199
Is there someone there?

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.119
- A hundred Euro.
- Here. I got it.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.794
What are you doing?

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.870
You called him a murderer. A psychopath.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.590
What?

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.470
But history will call us saviors.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.792
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.276
I'm not afraid to act, Robert.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.075
But doing nothing terrifies me.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.791
The path and the pointer,
he left that all for you.

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:14.397
Zobrist. You knew him?

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.519
"Knew him"?

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.879
I loved him.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.758
You're wearing his suit.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.510
No. Sienna, no.

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.273
Thank you, Robert.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.837
Thank you for everything.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.232
No! No!

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.470
Sienna, no!

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:39.154
Sienna!

01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.031
No, Sienna! Sienna, no!

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:13.036
<i>Slow down, slow down. You're too fast.</i>

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.271
Oh, come on. Come on.

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.837
<i>- This took me three days!</i>
<i>- Too easy!</i>

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.634
I love it.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.469
Everything before you was just...

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.034
...an idea.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.633
Now it's real.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:23.472
Love awakens the soul to act.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.839
That's not fair.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.630
Quoting Dante to me.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.319
But it's "beauty"...

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.634
...not "love."

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.236
What?

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:02.758
It's a minute to midnight.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.911
That's sooner than I expected.

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.793
Where are we going?

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.960
I see.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.510
We planned it together.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.440
We designed it together.

01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:38.190
But this part belongs only to you.

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:42.400
It's just safer if you don't know where.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.840
What if they find you first?

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.400
What then?

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.556
If you want to know you're not alone...

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.072
...you gotta start by trusting me.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.596
<i>And unless we take bold,</i>
<i>immediate action...</i>

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.198
...the sixth extinction...

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.799
<i>...will be our own.</i>

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.120
You were right.

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.477
I'm gonna make you another path.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.798
Inferno will be at the end.

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:40.070
If something should happen to me,
the first clue will be delivered to you.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:43.069
I know you'll do what must be done.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.673
Seek and find.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.753
You're not alone.

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.800
So...

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:00.397
...a beautiful young woman
went for the bad guy.

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.636
That happens.

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:06.713
You look disappointed.

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.114
I'll give you a minute.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.957
Elizabeth is not the one
who wants the virus to sell.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:16.756
You are.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:20.119
You've been used.

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.513
Elaborate schemes created by people
to get you to do what they want.

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:29.359
But me?

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.713
I'm very direct.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.436
And this is a moment
of great opportunity for me.

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.320
So where is the virus?

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.633
Come on, professor.

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.671
How much life is there in the world?

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.640
How much more is fighting to be born?

01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:59.354
Nothing wrong with thinning the herd
once in a while.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.550
It's healthy.

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:11.800
I've seen many acts of God:

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:14.555
Famine, typhoons, cholera.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.229
And you know what?

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.230
Sometimes, it hits the right people.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.432
- That's inhuman.
- Humanity is inhuman.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.277
Life may be cheap.
But a means to end it on a mass scale?

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.796
No one ever stops paying for that.

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:41.229
I'm going to ask you for the last...

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.910
Terribly sorry.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.549
Didn't see any other way.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.199
Must do this quickly.

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.517
The less blood, the better.

01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.795
Who are you?

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.639
A facilitator.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.879
Among other things,
my company creates illusions.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.919
You never had a real head wound.

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:14.873
But I lost my memory.

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:16.878
Chemically induced.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.312
We gave you an injection
of benzodiazepines.

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.113
Sorry. They can produce a skin rash.
Should fade in a day or so.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:33.109
All of this was a fake?

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.158
I prefer "created reality."

01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:40.280
My agents kidnapped you...

01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.316
...and cleared your memory
so we could create a fresh scenario...

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.951
...whereby you would be invested
in the idea of helping us.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:50.680
A small incision was made...

01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.672
<i>...in your scalp to give...</i>

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:54.911
...the impression of a bullet graze.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.836
There are no locks on hospital doors.

01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.515
Exactly.

01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.394
Highest marks.

01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.678
What about the policewoman
who shot the doctor in the hospital?

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:08.349
Also with me. Her gun fired blanks.

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.357
<i>And there were squibs in the door.</i>

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:13.239
<i>The doctor was an agent</i>
<i>wearing a blood packet.</i>

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:17.314
The taxi driver at the hospital
was working for us as well.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:22.511
In the Palazzo Vecchio,
she tried to kill me. With real bullets.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.109
At my behest.

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:30.311
When things had appeared to go tits up,
I tried to sweep it all away quickly.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.914
By killing me?

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.595
Oh, I apologize unreservedly, Mr. Langdon.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.676
I did lose an experienced agent.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.876
There's a great deal of situational
ebb and flow in my line of work.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.111
Look, here we both are now.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.190
I know I behaved terribly.

01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.192
But a puzzle needed solving.

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.431
Who better to solve it than you?

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.393
Glance away, will you?

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.833
Not my best work.

01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.991
But it'll do for the Italians.

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:32.400
Zobrist had followers everywhere,
but Sienna Brooks came to me for help.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.074
Or so I thought.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:38.834
She came to us with serious concerns
shortly after Zobrist died.

01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.874
Somehow, she knew Zobrist had hired us.

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.911
She said he was doing biological work
that could be lethal in the wrong hands.

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:50.073
She didn't mention a plague.
But we heard enough to be alarmed.

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:53.990
So we agreed to work with her
to find Zobrist's project.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.080
And when Dr. Sinskey brought you in,
we saw an opportunity.

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.912
- It was Elizabeth who came to see me.
- Yes.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:05.558
<i>Dr. Sinskey got the Faraday pointer</i>
<i>from Agent Bouchard.</i>

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:08.352
<i>She brought it to you to decode.</i>

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.876
<i>And she even secured it</i>
<i>with your thumbprint.</i>

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.078
<i>That left us with no choice.</i>

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.277
So we took you from her on the street.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.910
The hospital scenario encouraged you
to trust Dr. Brooks.

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.839
And your call to the consulate
was answered by our man.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.434
<i>Professor Langdon?</i>

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.990
Thank heavens you're alive.
We've been looking for you.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.355
Are you still in possession?

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.432
You had the pointer and we had you.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:37.480
It was all working seamlessly
until Miss Brooks stole you away.

01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:40.155
To make sure the virus is released.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.354
It appears.

01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:46.831
Young people are disappointing.

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:51.712
I find they become tolerable around 35.

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:56.751
You mentioned Dr. Sinskey.

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.313
I've been so worried.

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.636
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:13.760
- Are you?
- I'm okay.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.040
I'm all right.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:18.840
Thank God.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.951
- Do you know where the virus is?
- Istanbul.

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:31.239
<i>Now is the time.</i>

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.634
<i>Today is our rebirth.</i>

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.517
<i>Inferno is salvation.</i>

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.751
I am so sorry I brought you into this,
Robert, after all these years.

01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:48.719
No. I'm glad you did.

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:51.837
I met him, you know. Zobrist.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.316
Two years ago. He asked for my help.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:57.994
He wanted the W.H.O.
to endorse mass sterilization...

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.271
...in drinking water and staple foods.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.311
So I threw him out of my office,
put him on a watch list...

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.152
...but he disappeared...

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:13.438
...and I suppose that's when Zobrist
hired Sims.

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:17.274
I should probably have had... Yeah.

01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.590
I don't know.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:23.352
What? You have always blamed yourself
for things that weren't your fault.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.957
Still very sweet.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.518
Here. The doorway.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.911
I wish it would've happened differently
back then.

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:07.672
We didn't look after it. It fell apart.

01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:10.319
Is that a regret?

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:14.997
Only when I think about it.

01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:23.959
The most interesting things
happen in doorways.

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:28.470
At the borders, right along the edges.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.194
Ancient fishermen learned to sail
where the warm water met the cold.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:40.238
The little fish would reach the edge
of the warm water and they'd stop...

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.950
...and the big fish would come out
of the cold water and they'd eat them.

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:47.796
And the fishermen, well,
they caught everybody.

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.315
Doorways.

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:01.160
Not one particle of you has changed,
Robert.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:06.558
You talk too much.

01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:10.194
And then...

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.920
...not at all.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:15.594
Elizabeth.

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.675
I couldn't ask you not to go to Geneva.

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:26.430
Couldn't.

01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.958
I didn't want to ask you
to leave Cambridge.

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:37.917
Is that how it happened?

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:42.032
I don't trust my memory anymore.

01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:45.512
I never forget anything.

01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:47.155
Well, that's a gift.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.720
No. It isn't.

01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.397
Leave him alone! What are you doing?
Where are you...? Leave him alone!

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:10.710
Turn around!

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:13.871
Don't look at me, bitch. Look away.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:16.236
Stop it!

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:22.236
Don't look!

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.194
Robert!

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:49.589
Thanks.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.074
I'm a friend of the poet.

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.478
For what did Zobrist die?

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.793
That others may live.

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:57.320
I've come very far
to make sure nothing interferes.

01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.519
<i>The delivery system we designed...</i>

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.030
<i>...will discharge the viral agent</i>
<i>by midnight tonight.</i>

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.476
<i>But there are others</i>
<i>who are on their way to stop it.</i>

01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:09.357
I need to find it before they do and
trigger an explosion to ensure its release.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.394
How do we help?

01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.033
During the Plague of Justinian...

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:19.750
...5000 people died every day
in the streets of Istanbul.

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:22.355
The border between East and West,
another doorway.

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:25.915
Which is why he chose it.

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:28.992
If the bag's intact, we can contain it.

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.880
But if someone ruptures it
before we get there...

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.795
...95 percent of the Earth's population
will be infected in four to seven days.

01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:15.556
Professor. Doctor. My name is Mirsat,
I am the curator here.

01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.031
Have you completely
evacuated the building?

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.352
Well, to the extent that we can,
but the place is massive.

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:33.354
Could you tell me specifically
what it is you're looking for?

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.557
The tomb of Enrico Dandolo.

01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:37.319
Of course. This way.

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:51.000
"Kneel within the gilded museum
of holy wisdom.

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:54.917
Listen for the sounds of trickling water.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.391
Follow deep into the sunken palace."

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.993
- I hear water flowing under these stones.
- Where does it go?

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:13.152
It's just drainage.
It goes to the city cistern.

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:15.152
We are looking for a large
underground space...

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:18.313
...perhaps with columns,
artificially lit from within.

01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.790
That's it. The ancient cistern.

01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:22.076
Sixth century.

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.399
Well, some call it "The Sunken Palace."

01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.876
Take us there.

01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.277
His words can only mean one thing:

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.359
"The Sunken Palace."

01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:36.480
Once we descend, you'll see exactly
what he described.

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:42.276
How do I use it?

01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:47.194
There's a cap in the putty of each brick.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:50.034
The device also has a detonation button.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:54.032
A call from this cell phone
will trigger the explosion.

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.078
And that's enough to break the bag?

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.914
The walls are cement, all around.

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:03.074
You need both bombs, different angles,
as far apart as you can.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.038
That will break the bag.

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:15.032
History says that the Black Plague
caused misery and death.

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.396
But what they don't tell us...

01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:20.120
...is that it also produced
a leaner population...

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.198
...and gave birth to the Renaissance.

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.876
And we are rushing as fast as we can
into the seventh circle of hell.

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.719
The suicidal and the profligate.

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:30.395
Why is suffering later
preferable to suffering now?

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:35.191
What if we embrace it?
I mean, maybe pain can save us.

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.320
You're getting this, aren't you?

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.917
I can see that you are.

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.074
I mean, I need to know that I'm not alone.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:40:59.515
Too many damned people.

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:01.870
He's chosen well.

01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:05.920
I need schematics of all conduits
in and out of the cistern.

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:09.916
Full isolation and containment protocols.

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:12.555
Physical and chemical barriers along...
Wait!

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:19.670
- This is the city's water supply?
- Well, not anymore. We've modernized.

01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:23.237
- But there is water in there?
- Yes, it eventually filters into the earth.

01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.960
- But why are all these people here?
- It's a tourist attraction.

01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:27.554
The acoustics are excellent.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:31.113
Tonight is the summer solstice concert.
Very popular.

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:33.954
People come from all over the world
to hear it.

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.911
He created a bioaerosol.

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.472
So it will spread in the air.

01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:43.237
- Empty the place.
- No! Contain it.

01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:48.117
Jam all communications down there.
No messages get in or out.

01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.509
Got it.

01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:52.760
Shall we go in?

01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:59.549
Robert, you don't have to go in there
with us.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.514
Yes, I do.

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:21.797
"Blood-red waters of the lagoon
that reflects no stars."

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.633
My God, this is a labyrinth!

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:25.874
How many sections?

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:28.680
There are dozens, professor. Dozens.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.120
Let's find it.

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.000
Check every section. Every column.

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.799
Check them all.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:38.195
Spread out.

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.832
Cut off cell phone service now!

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.514
- No communication.
- Yes, sir.

01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:03.079
<i>Who's our U.S. contact over here?</i>
<i>I need some help.</i>

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:08.600
- Here, this way. Medusa.
- The Greek spirit? Why?

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.153
Belongs to a specific category
of Greek spirits. The chthonic monsters.

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.637
- This is it?
- Yes.

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.634
The color, the columns,
exactly what we saw in the video.

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:22.120
This is the area, so spread out.
Check pillars.

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:25.512
- I'll take the wall line.
- The corners. Under the walkway.

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.870
If you find anything,
report to me immediately.

01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.559
The bag is here somewhere. Seconds matter.

01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:50.271
Excuse me. Excuse me. What's going on?

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.432
Sir, I need you to step aside.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:55.471
Step aside! Everyone!

01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:34.759
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm.</i>

01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:46.676
I got it!

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:49.111
It's here! In this far corner!

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:31.434
Don't!

01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.229
- HAZMAT guys aren't set yet.
- Can't wait.

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.596
Quickly! This could break any moment.

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:27.714
Sienna!

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:31.149
Sienna!

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:40.674
Does this cube nitrogen purge
without glove access?

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:42.274
- It should.
- It better.

01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:54.158
Sienna! Sienna.

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:57.996
There are too many of us down here.
You won't get to that bag before we do.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:00.914
No. But I can make sure it breaks.

01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.630
Come on, don't do this, Sienna, don't.
You'll be murdering innocents.

01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:08.510
Yes, people will die, a lot of them,
but the crisis will be averted.

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.190
It's what nature demands.

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:15.120
The problem won't just be slowed down,
it'll be solved. Permanently.

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:19.360
Killing billions to save lives?
That's the logic of tyrants.

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.877
- For a greater good, humanity...
- Genius does not come with extra rights.

01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:26.551
No, it comes with the responsibility
to take action when others won't.

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.200
You wanna do something? Fine.

01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:31.910
Then scream at the top of your lungs
and invent and lead!

01:47:32.080 --> 01:47:37.314
If you love humanity, if you love
this planet, you'd do anything to save it.

01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:39.437
The greatest sins in human history...

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.871
...have been committed
in the name of love.

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:44.396
No one will look on this act
and call it love.

01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.114
They'll be alive.

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.675
What does it matter
what they say about us?

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:35.479
Hey, what are you doing? No!

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:26.993
No. Don't shoot the box!

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:44.959
Robert, get clear!

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.673
Are you all right? You all right?

01:51:03.880 --> 01:51:04.996
I'm fine.

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:07.880
Where's the box? Where's the box?

01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:54.076
It's contained.

01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:56.034
No breach.

01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:00.235
The virus is completely contained.

01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:02.674
The virus is contained.

01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:05.958
<i>- All medical units stand by.</i>
- We'll take it from here, Dr. Sinskey.

01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:09.914
<i>Target is contained</i>
<i>and preparing for transport.</i>

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:19.749
<i>Containment confirmed.</i>
<i>I repeat, containment confirmed.</i>

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.238
All right. I'm on it.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.515
She thought she was saving the world.

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:11.800
So did they all.

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:24.718
So, what happens now?

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.712
We take it back to Geneva
for taxonomy and isolation.

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.876
We have to generate
a metagenome sequence first...

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:34.191
...to get an idea
of what we're dealing with.

01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:38.631
There's a lot of work to be done.

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:46.319
And you? Cambridge?

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:51.035
Yeah.

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:55.430
Dr. Sinskey?

01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.636
Life pulls us apart again.

01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:07.196
Like Dante and Beatrice.

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:13.352
I have something for you.

01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:29.720
I picked this up the night you were taken.

01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:32.560
I seem to remember
it was important to you.

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.993
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:45.153
Do you ever think...

01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:49.271
...about what could happen
with you and me?

01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:52.355
I do.

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:59.558
I guess life must have its mysteries,
professor.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.559
Even for us.

01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:39.835
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.674
Have you seen Marta Alvarez
of the museum staff?

01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:46.317
Marta isn't here just now.
She's had her baby.

01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:47.755
She had her baby?

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:50.634
Oh, that is great news. Great news.

01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:53.031
You might tell someone
that the lights on the Dante mask...

01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:55.237
...should be turned on
because I could barely see it.

01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:59.553
I know, I'm sorry, sir, the Dante mask
is no longer here. It was stolen.

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:01.992
Really? I was just looking at it.

01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:05.109
Excuse me.
