Well, sure, there are other ways
to make a boy,

he could do with the tools he's got.

-Nice to meet you. I'm Sofia.

29:25.083 --> 29:26.958

It's a great little...

29:27.041 --> 29:28.791
Excuse me, Sofia. I'm sorry to interrupt,

29:28.875 --> 29:31.375
but I'm Pinocchio's conscience,
and I overslept.

29:31.458 --> 29:34.541

and airlift me to the school?

29:34.625 --> 29:36.000

-Sofia, I really need to get to him.

on the streets without a conscience.

he's gonna get into?

29:46.916 --> 29:49.125

PINOCCHIO: No. I'm going to school

32:01.041 --> 32:05.625
so I can learn a bunch of stuff
to be a real boy and make my father proud.

32:05.708 --> 32:06.708
A real boy?

32:06.791 --> 32:12.541
Why on earth would you want to be real
when you can be famous?

32:13.416 --> 32:15.791
-Famous?
-Yes, famous.

32:15.875 --> 32:18.208
I'm speaking of the theater.

32:18.291 --> 32:23.166
Bright lights. Music. Applause. Fame!

32:23.250 --> 32:24.958
Fame? But I want to be real.

32:25.958 --> 32:27.166
Yes, yes, my boy.

32:27.250 --> 32:30.583
But did you know, many people say
that you're not actually real

32:30.666 --> 32:32.416
until everybody knows about you?

32:32.500 --> 32:37.041
Why, to be famous is to be real.
Until then, you're just a nobody.

32:37.125 --> 32:40.625
Do you want to be a nobody?
No! Nobody wants to be a nobody.

32:40.708 --> 32:44.458
Everybody who's anybody
wants to be a somebody.

32:45.708 --> 32:47.791
But my father said I should go to school.

32:47.875 --> 32:51.791
Of course he did. All parents say that.
But he doesn't recognize your genius.

32:51.875 --> 32:52.916

when one has such a personality,
such a profile, such a physique?

32:56.500 --> 32:59.125
Why, he is a natural born actor.
Right, Gideon?

Nay, an influencer.

33:04.166 --> 33:06.500

they ain't.

He's made of wood. I'm coming, Pinocchio.

1:22:45.708 --> 1:22:49.833
Father, I'm sorry I didn't come home
after I got kicked out of school.

1:22:49.916 --> 1:22:51.708
You got kicked out of school?

1:22:51.791 --> 1:22:53.541
Yes, for being a puppet.

1:22:53.625 --> 1:22:56.125
So I joined the puppet show
and became famous.

1:22:56.208 --> 1:22:57.541
You became famous?

1:22:59.125 --> 1:23:01.291
I danced in a puppet show
and made lots of money.

1:23:01.375 --> 1:23:03.708
But then I got kidnapped
and was locked in a bird cage,

1:23:03.791 --> 1:23:07.875
so I had to tell a bunch of fibs to Jiminy
so my nose would grow so I could escape.

1:23:07.958 --> 1:23:10.750
But then I got scooped up
by a coach full of foolish kids,

1:23:10.833 --> 1:23:12.250
and was taken to Pleasure Island,

1:23:12.333 --> 1:23:14.791
where I learned to drink...
Uh, I forget what they called it.

1:23:14.875 --> 1:23:17.750
But anyway, Pleasure Island was bad
because I grew donkey ears

1:23:17.833 --> 1:23:21.416
and was chased by the vapor creatures
who wanted to sell me to the salt mines.

1:23:21.500 --> 1:23:25.041
But Jiminy helped me and we jumped off
a cliff into the sea and swam to shore,

1:23:25.125 --> 1:23:27.708
where we found out you
sold all your clocks to buy a boat

1:23:27.791 --> 1:23:29.125
so you could look for me.

1:23:29.208 --> 1:23:30.250
And now we're here!

You did all that in one day?

PINOCCHIO: Yes.

1:23:35.625 --> 1:23:39.333

a fraction of that in my whole life.

1:23:39.416 --> 1:23:43.708
I'm sorry, Father.
I apologize for all the trouble I caused.

1:35:49.875 --> 1:35:52.958
We sure have, Father.
Now let's get you home.

1:35:55.208 --> 1:35:57.250

1:36:00.208 --> 1:36:04.250
Come on, Cleo, Figaro. But...

1:36:06.041 --> 1:36:07.791
Pinocchio,

1:36:10.583 --> 1:36:11.791
do you know the way?

1:36:12.958 --> 1:36:14.666
We'll follow that light.
