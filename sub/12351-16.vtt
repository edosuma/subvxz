WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:01.584
Previously on Greek.

00:01.752 --> 00:04.462
How could you possibly imagine,
that we have anything in common ?

00:04.630 --> 00:06.297
- I just thought...
- We did.

00:06.465 --> 00:08.643
I wanna be as brave as you.
Maybe explore a little.

00:08.768 --> 00:10.898
I thought it would look
really good on you.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.374
- Let's try it, shall we ?
- Is that from Evan ?

00:13.499 --> 00:16.154
- It's a keepsake I can keep forever.
- Think that was his idea ?

00:16.279 --> 00:19.185
- Have you seen Rebecca ?
- She was gonna step out get some air.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.932
- If we go upstairs ?
- Why do you wanna go... ?

00:22.057 --> 00:22.927
My God !

00:23.052 --> 00:24.398
I just miss you.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.610
Now you're double dating with Evan
and Rebecca instead of me and Cappie.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.070
- Have fun.
- You, too.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.641
If anybody knows his way
inside the beltway, it's Joel.

00:31.766 --> 00:34.813
We mostly hire people with post-graduate
degrees for legislative aide jobs.

00:34.938 --> 00:37.203
- What about law school ?
- I'm gonna go to law school.

00:37.453 --> 00:39.832
That's great. And I've made
a pretty big decision myself.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.541
This is a form for declaring a major.
Wait, this is blank.

00:49.641 --> 00:53.262
Hey, Cap, I hope you don't mind. But
I moved some of your stuff off your desk

00:53.387 --> 00:55.184
and put it over there.

00:56.297 --> 00:57.398
I have a desk ?

00:57.715 --> 00:59.356
Is that your personal statement ?

00:59.481 --> 01:02.766
Your second draft was great. Although,
I preferred the font on your ninth.

01:02.891 --> 01:05.081
OK. Well,
It has to be perfect, given my

01:05.364 --> 01:08.352
OK grades and not-so-OK
practice LSAT scores.

01:08.774 --> 01:11.493
Georgetown,
Stanford and CRU all place

01:11.618 --> 01:14.563
great importance on
the personal statement.

01:15.383 --> 01:18.278
I get it, all right ?
I'm dealing with future stuff, too.

01:18.559 --> 01:20.788
Like thinking about
declaring a real major.

01:20.956 --> 01:24.396
If I get into CRU law, which would be
ideal because it's a really good school

01:24.521 --> 01:27.536
and it's here and you find
a major that you love,

01:27.661 --> 01:29.904
maybe we could end up
graduating at the same time.

01:30.029 --> 01:32.224
- Isn't that crazy, right ?
- The craziest.

01:32.480 --> 01:34.732
Done in seven years.
I'll be like Speedy Gonzales.

01:34.857 --> 01:37.861
Maybe I should study Spanish,
or Espana as they say.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.658
If you need help finding a major, I can
always go through your transcripts.

01:41.783 --> 01:44.145
No, no, no, no.
I want you to focus on law school.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.355
Asking for help isn't a bad thing.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.859
That's why I'm so glad that Joel agreed
to read this and give me feedback.

01:50.027 --> 01:51.061
Joel...

01:52.362 --> 01:53.320
the Orgy Guy ?

01:53.488 --> 01:56.991
Can we call him Joel the guy who is
going to help Casey get into Law School?

01:57.311 --> 02:00.358
I don't know, Orgy Guy gives
him a lot more personality.

02:00.792 --> 02:03.497
Or personalidante,
as they would say.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.502
All right. Bye, Cap.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.049
Pull !

02:14.101 --> 02:15.238
And... pull !

02:19.112 --> 02:20.806
Dumptruck, guys,
what are you doing ?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.267
Those go in the Dumpster.
But this is way more fun.

02:23.436 --> 02:25.561
- And more fast.
- And no one lives in that house.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.049
And since Jeremy left,

02:27.174 --> 02:30.024
no one lives in the Dumpster.
So let's use it.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.338
Mornin', Spitter.

02:32.201 --> 02:34.528
- Why so grumpy ?
- These guys won't use the Dumpster.

02:35.845 --> 02:37.198
- I miss Jeremy.
- Yeah.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.657
- You have a major, right ?
- Did you pick one yet ?

02:40.111 --> 02:42.759
It's a big commitment.
I was thinking about archeology.

02:42.884 --> 02:45.581
- I've always liked Indiana Jones.
- Did you see the last movie ?

02:45.749 --> 02:47.458
Good point.
How about astronaut ?

02:47.798 --> 02:48.918
That's not a major.

02:49.086 --> 02:52.129
- Looks like I'm back to square one.
- You probably have a lot of options.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.869
You just need to focus.

02:54.138 --> 02:57.325
That's the problem. See, I'm not
a fan of the focus-y stuff, you know ?

03:01.673 --> 03:04.099
Hey, Mr. Spitter,
I think Dumptruck might be dead.

03:11.570 --> 03:13.108
Any of this belong to you boys ?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.406
Never seen it.

03:16.949 --> 03:19.406
No big deal,
but there's a lot more over there.

03:19.574 --> 03:22.368
if you all worked together,
you could clear it out in an afternoon.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.994
Wait.
Who are you ?

03:24.162 --> 03:25.329
Your new neighbors.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.078
-= 316 =-

03:46.433 --> 03:47.441
Hey, stranger !

03:47.566 --> 03:49.186
How was your big date with Pete ?

03:49.354 --> 03:50.479
It was amazing.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.446
Tell me.

03:51.571 --> 03:53.706
I want to,
but I'm running late for a potato chip

03:53.831 --> 03:55.692
focus group for
my retail marketing class.

03:56.051 --> 03:57.235
Sounds salty.

03:57.645 --> 04:00.614
And I volunteered us to do nametags
and cups for the dorm reunion.

04:01.020 --> 04:04.201
Crap ! The freshman dorm reunion, right.
I'll get cups from the KT house.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.247
Guess whose roommate
is gonna be there.

04:06.372 --> 04:07.997
- Yours ?
- No, but

04:08.165 --> 04:09.891
it turns out Janine's freshman 15

04:10.016 --> 04:11.792
is now a two-year-old named Toby.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.960
No way !

04:14.300 --> 04:16.589
- So Sunny's going to be there ?
- She never liked me.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.487
So...

04:17.612 --> 04:19.947
name tags.
I have this focus group until three.

04:20.265 --> 04:23.592
- How about we do them at four ?
- I'm meeting Joel at four. Six ?

04:23.717 --> 04:26.495
- I have dinner with Pete.
- And including your making out...

04:26.620 --> 04:28.017
How about ten ?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.394
Pledge bonding.
We're doing kitty collages.

04:30.737 --> 04:32.507
And I have class all day tomorrow.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.315
Tomorrow night ?
7 : 30 ?

04:35.093 --> 04:36.150
7 : 30 nametags.

04:36.687 --> 04:37.687
Great.

04:38.198 --> 04:40.812
Along with all the details
on your date with Pete.

04:44.036 --> 04:45.573
How can smelly, old people

04:45.698 --> 04:47.559
just move in next door ?
Isn't that illegal ?

04:47.684 --> 04:50.223
I thought you said after
that fraternity disbanded in the'80s,

04:50.348 --> 04:52.124
no one lived there
anymore it's cursed.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.751
It is.
By us.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.358
Our Mardi Gras party is next week,
which means Ma and Pa

04:56.483 --> 04:58.422
Poopy-pants are gonna
be pooping on our party.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.868
I think we are overreacting
a little bit.

05:00.993 --> 05:03.482
The Hilgendorfs seem
like reasonable people.

05:04.021 --> 05:05.021
What ?

05:05.580 --> 05:08.724
We had a very interesting conversation
when we were cleaning out their yard.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.018
Professor Hilgendorf
is a music historian.

05:11.439 --> 05:12.394
He's faculty ?

05:12.562 --> 05:14.003
Rusty, trust me, this is bad.

05:14.128 --> 05:16.690
They're gonna want us
to be neighborly, respectful,

05:16.858 --> 05:18.222
quiet.
That's not us.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.886
We need to get them gone.

05:20.011 --> 05:22.230
- How about a haunting ?
- Where are the chains at ?

05:22.355 --> 05:24.156
I think we could get along
with them.

05:24.421 --> 05:26.367
Good fences, good neighbors ?

05:26.695 --> 05:29.370
I'll take care of it,
and you can concentrate on your major.

05:36.320 --> 05:38.170
Guys. Against my better judgment

05:38.338 --> 05:41.036
Spitter is going over there to make
nice. So someone start a pool to see

05:41.161 --> 05:43.865
how long I have until I get
to tell him "I told you so."

05:45.595 --> 05:47.471
Cap, I did something,

05:47.787 --> 05:49.348
and I feel kinda bad about it.

05:49.732 --> 05:51.892
Well, you seem extremely upset.

05:52.174 --> 05:53.644
I had sex with Rebecca Logan !

05:56.194 --> 05:57.284
I'm sorry.

05:57.846 --> 06:00.424
I broke the bro code.
If you want to hit me, I understand.

06:00.549 --> 06:02.529
Wait.
Is this like last year

06:02.846 --> 06:04.863
when you "had sex"
with Wonder Woman ?

06:05.899 --> 06:07.367
I'm still not convinced I didn't.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.750
Remember the rope burns
when the guys were teasing you

06:09.875 --> 06:12.463
- with the Lasso of Truth ?
- Yeah, OK. But...

06:13.342 --> 06:16.291
I'm still 75 to 25 percent
sure I had sex with Rebecca.

06:16.459 --> 06:17.559
I was drinking...

06:17.684 --> 06:20.546
Why don't you just keep this to
yourself until you're absolutely sure.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.924
We wouldn't want Wonder
Woman to get jealous?

06:27.392 --> 06:29.192
Let's go get those chains.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.178
You look pretty cheery for a guy
who lost his date last night.

06:45.303 --> 06:48.143
Rebecca left me a message.
Apparently, she had food poisoning

06:48.268 --> 06:50.283
and she ran out
so she wouldn't throw up on me.

06:50.502 --> 06:52.161
You sure she didn't see you dance ?

06:52.329 --> 06:53.155
Funny.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.080
With the extra time
I had this morning,

06:55.248 --> 06:57.707
I was able to finish the last
of my law school applications.

06:58.660 --> 07:01.519
- Let's celebrate.
- Looks like you already are, man.

07:01.644 --> 07:03.451
- What's up with Club Calvin ?
- Well.

07:03.576 --> 07:05.466
I'm making a gay-list.

07:05.634 --> 07:06.558
A what ?

07:06.683 --> 07:08.476
It's a playlist of gay music.

07:08.601 --> 07:10.843
Does this have to do
with Grant's new...

07:11.206 --> 07:11.972
look ?

07:12.776 --> 07:13.901
Yeah, a little.

07:14.026 --> 07:15.914
It's just that I've been surrounded
by so much

07:16.039 --> 07:18.854
straight in my life, I've never opened
my eyes to see what else is out there.

07:19.022 --> 07:21.715
Seeing Grant sort of explore this new
world has motivated me

07:21.840 --> 07:24.222
- to do the same.
- To boldly go where

07:24.347 --> 07:26.361
ten percent of men have gone before.

07:27.679 --> 07:30.152
Yeah. Seriously.
Stop dancing.

07:30.277 --> 07:33.087
Evan, I was looking for you.
I was going through the receipts from

07:33.212 --> 07:36.663
the party and there's like $500
missing from the petty cash.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.730
- I think someone stole it.
- Wait, like a guest from last night ?

07:42.855 --> 07:44.546
No, the cash box is hidden.

07:44.944 --> 07:47.007
Only a brother would
even know to look for it.

07:47.335 --> 07:49.301
It sounds like we have
a thief in the house.

07:56.605 --> 07:57.605
Damn.

07:58.298 --> 08:01.658
I hate when my human sexuality
study group finishes without me.

08:01.783 --> 08:03.732
What can I say ?
You came late.

08:05.751 --> 08:06.751
So...

08:08.325 --> 08:10.197
I heard the craziest thing today.

08:10.366 --> 08:12.241
Beaver thinks he had
sex with you last night.

08:12.410 --> 08:15.327
He told you ? My God, you guys
gossip worse than sority girls.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.830
He was right ?
Was this Chambers-inspired ?

08:17.998 --> 08:20.499
Did he sleep with a townie ?
Get a few of your sisters expelled ?

08:21.418 --> 08:23.377
He bought me a necklace
for Valentine's Day.

08:23.502 --> 08:25.832
And you didn't like it ?
No, it's beautiful.

08:25.957 --> 08:28.152
A silver, teardrop pendant with a
diamond...

08:29.759 --> 08:33.428
that I'm not wearing. It's just,
he's being romantic and buying me gifts

08:33.597 --> 08:36.618
and it's all very sweet and overwhelming
and something I'm not used to.

08:36.743 --> 08:40.227
Well setting aside the possible personal
attack and considering you and I dated

08:40.674 --> 08:43.534
and that Evan is a first-class ass-hat,
shouldn't you be happy

08:43.659 --> 08:45.157
that you're being wooed ?

08:45.425 --> 08:48.360
Unless you really like him and that
freaks you out so you're messing

08:48.528 --> 08:50.654
- all this up on purpose.
- What ?

08:50.823 --> 08:54.308
Spring break ? Wet T-shirt contest ?
"I'm beneath you" ? Ring any bells ?

08:54.433 --> 08:57.327
Don't confuse your old feelings about
me with the way I felt about you.

09:00.919 --> 09:04.315
OK, maybe I don't like getting too
comfortable. What can I say ?

09:04.440 --> 09:07.504
Well, you can say how Chambers took it
when you dumped him. Did he cry ?

09:07.672 --> 09:09.959
- Why would I dump him ?
- Why wouldn't you ?

09:10.084 --> 09:12.759
Look, I like Evan.
And as much as it might bother you,

09:12.928 --> 09:16.270
I do care about him. I just don't
want things to get so serious.

09:16.579 --> 09:18.630
That doesn't mean I'm ready
to throw in the towel.

09:18.755 --> 09:21.528
If you're not gonna dump him,
aren't you worried he's gonna find out

09:21.653 --> 09:23.068
- about Beaver ?
- Not really.

09:23.193 --> 09:24.980
Who's gonna believe Beaver ?
You didn't.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.926
Good point.
Just promise me one thing.

09:27.051 --> 09:30.499
- I won't hurt your brother.
- Please, he had sex, he's fine.

09:30.624 --> 09:32.403
If you decide to tell Evan,

09:32.573 --> 09:35.200
just let me know.
I'd like to be there for that.

09:37.369 --> 09:38.846
Just text me about it.

09:41.365 --> 09:43.266
Well, it's a little...

09:45.125 --> 09:45.834
dry.

09:46.652 --> 09:49.004
Dry can be good.
Like a martini.

09:49.173 --> 09:52.174
It reads like your resume in paragraph
form. It won't distinguish you from

09:52.342 --> 09:54.722
- the thousands of other applicants.
- Thousands ?

09:54.847 --> 09:57.804
And I bet they started working
on this last fall instead of last month.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.857
If it makes you feel any better,
I always planned to go to law school and

10:00.982 --> 10:02.809
I didn't know what to
write for mine, either.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.854
- How'd you figure it out ?
- The Backstreet Boys.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.481
I can write about them.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.149
It wasn't just about them.

10:09.318 --> 10:12.792
I couldn't understand how the Supreme
Court had made such a bad decision

10:12.917 --> 10:14.800
on this voting rights case,

10:15.226 --> 10:16.824
and then I remembered that

10:17.273 --> 10:18.742
I took my ex-wife

10:18.911 --> 10:21.245
to a Backstreet Boys
concert for our first date.

10:21.979 --> 10:23.303
Another bad decision

10:23.428 --> 10:26.166
and a connection between
me and our nation's highest court.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.251
Ex-wife ?

10:28.586 --> 10:29.876
Sorry, none of my...

10:30.243 --> 10:32.338
We got married a week
after graduation,

10:32.643 --> 10:34.892
I started law school
and she started working.

10:35.414 --> 10:38.178
Somewhere between trusts
and estates and cyberlaw,

10:38.347 --> 10:41.556
- we found ourselves on different paths.
- I'm sorry.

10:41.724 --> 10:44.822
Don't be. The older you get,
the more you realize

10:44.947 --> 10:47.388
some people should be
around your entire life

10:47.513 --> 10:50.315
and others should just
make an appearance.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.070
So...

10:54.686 --> 10:55.658
I should

10:55.783 --> 10:58.907
find a personal connection
between myself and the law.

11:00.832 --> 11:04.454
I stole a pair of earrings from
Claire's when I was in seventh grade.

11:05.299 --> 11:09.084
Misdemeanor. Now, if you have ever been
charged with murder or arson...

11:09.253 --> 11:11.336
Charged ?
No. No, no.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.505
No !

11:13.061 --> 11:14.089
No charging.

11:14.893 --> 11:17.426
- So when are your applications due ?
- Friday.

11:17.595 --> 11:21.266
Then I hope you've got a lot of time to
do some thinking in the next few days,

11:21.391 --> 11:23.140
because you got some work to do.

11:31.543 --> 11:33.971
So far, so good
with the Hilgendorfs.

11:34.578 --> 11:37.264
I had the pledges sweep their porch,
clean their gutters

11:37.389 --> 11:38.905
and wire their surround sound.

11:39.074 --> 11:42.326
Which just leaves me
with my major major problem.

11:42.495 --> 11:44.210
Have you thought about English ?

11:44.731 --> 11:46.955
That's a great idea.
I already speak it.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.124
Right ?

11:49.459 --> 11:51.793
- Professor Hilgendorf.
- Nope.

11:51.962 --> 11:53.045
Call me Tom.

11:53.214 --> 11:55.315
Margie made these to thank you boys.

11:59.303 --> 12:01.428
- Free food !
- Free food ? Where ?

12:07.628 --> 12:09.904
Listen, I also wanted to talk
to you about your fence.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.699
I think it's kind of strange,
the way it abuts our house.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.443
You got beer pong.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.362
Why ?
Is it too loud ?

12:18.531 --> 12:21.353
Welcome to the best part
of the neighborhood, Tom-o.

12:21.733 --> 12:22.616
Eye candy.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.452
That's my daughter.

12:25.621 --> 12:28.246
Her name is Hannah.
And she is 16 years old.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.671
Sixteen.

12:29.961 --> 12:32.626
- I repeat, sixteen.
- Thanks, Dad.

12:32.795 --> 12:35.793
That was mortifying.
Mom said dinner's ready in ten minutes.

12:35.918 --> 12:37.047
I better get going.

12:37.216 --> 12:38.882
- Enjoy your meatloaf.
- I will.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.967
Also, can I ask you guys

12:41.092 --> 12:43.762
to rein in the noise after 10 pm
on school nights ?

12:44.304 --> 12:46.747
- That sounds sort of reasonable.
- You know what ?

12:46.872 --> 12:50.340
Here's a few other simple
requests that you shouldn't mind at all.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.976
"Noise curfew of midnight on Friday
and Saturday, lawn free of alcohol,

12:56.101 --> 12:59.152
furniture and debris,
no foul language at any time ?"

12:59.321 --> 13:00.334
Thanks, guys.

13:03.566 --> 13:05.521
- Who had six hours ?
- That'd be me.

13:05.646 --> 13:07.686
Someone pay the man,
because, Spitter,

13:07.811 --> 13:10.872
I told you so !

13:18.665 --> 13:21.925
included a link to a very fascinating
clip about a high-speed robot hand.

13:22.094 --> 13:24.428
But do you think that that
was too forward of me ?

13:24.553 --> 13:27.506
And how long do you think I should
wait before I take the hint ?

13:28.823 --> 13:31.718
I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for
you to discuss your brother in terms

13:31.843 --> 13:33.812
- of romantic liaison ?
- Always.

13:34.229 --> 13:36.983
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I'm really stressed.

13:37.717 --> 13:40.485
Maybe we should get a cup of coffee
and discuss what's bothering you.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.357
And about these feelings I'm having.

13:42.482 --> 13:44.410
As fun as that sounds,

13:44.833 --> 13:47.242
I really need to work
on my personal statement.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.470
Maybe I could come over
and brainstorm some ideas.

13:50.595 --> 13:52.289
I was recently accepted
into Yale Law.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.344
Congratulations !

13:54.469 --> 13:55.672
That'd be great.

13:55.797 --> 13:57.429
- You don't mind ?
- Of Course not.

13:57.554 --> 14:00.578
 While we work, I could ask you some
hypothetical questions about dating ?

14:00.703 --> 14:03.133
We could pretend
I'm not talking about your brother.

14:07.362 --> 14:08.468
Bite me, A.

14:09.446 --> 14:11.681
- Who you calling an A ?
- You, you R.

14:12.312 --> 14:13.729
What the H is an R ?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.854
I think it's the same as a Q.

14:18.914 --> 14:20.590
Well, this turned out well.

14:22.016 --> 14:24.279
Come on, Cap.
What's the harm in a few rules ?

14:24.738 --> 14:26.570
Well, one, most Kts can't spell,

14:26.695 --> 14:29.826
and two, this is a fraternity house.
At least it used to be.

14:29.995 --> 14:32.014
I'll go over there
and talk to Tom again.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.002
What, so he can assign
a dress code ?

14:34.127 --> 14:37.393
No, this is when we fight back,
this is when we play dirty,

14:37.849 --> 14:39.377
this is when we make them pay.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.519
We cannot go to war
with a faculty member.

14:41.644 --> 14:43.394
We will all get expelled.

14:43.676 --> 14:46.092
Wait a minute.
We can Borg him.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.202
I'll get Heath.

14:49.199 --> 14:50.263
Absorb him

14:50.432 --> 14:53.932
into our collective.
If he feels like he's one of us,

14:54.057 --> 14:56.436
maybe he will relax the rules.

14:56.792 --> 14:58.583
You know,  that oddly makes sense.

14:58.708 --> 15:01.575
And maybe he could help
you pick a major. He is faculty,

15:02.163 --> 15:05.403
and the one thing old people love
to do more than anything else

15:05.572 --> 15:07.113
is give advice to kids.

15:08.658 --> 15:09.658
Z...

15:10.354 --> 15:11.117
S...

15:11.530 --> 15:13.680
I bet I know who stole the money.

15:14.417 --> 15:16.646
Don't want to be elitist,
but hello ?

15:16.771 --> 15:18.708
- Housekeeping ?
- Everybody, calm down.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.619
Let's not turn this
into a witch-hunt.

15:21.744 --> 15:22.837
I bet it was Trip.

15:22.962 --> 15:25.966
He's the first to blame everyone else
so he can throw suspicion off himself.

15:26.135 --> 15:28.343
What am I supposed to do,
just let us get ripped off ?

15:28.512 --> 15:32.250
No one's saying do nothing, Trip.
There's no reason to turn on each other.

15:32.558 --> 15:35.350
Does it really matter who took it ?
It's only 500 bucks.

15:35.884 --> 15:38.645
Maybe Grant took it. Can't be cheap
to change your look overnight.

15:38.813 --> 15:41.022
Maybe crazy Natalie tricked you
into stealing it for her.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.149
What did I just say
about turning on each other ?

15:43.318 --> 15:46.695
Guys, what I meant is maybe we can all
 pitch in a little cash and cover it.

15:46.864 --> 15:48.721
- Problem solved.
- It's not about the money.

15:48.846 --> 15:51.292
- It's the principle.
- Maybe it was Chambers.

15:51.417 --> 15:54.369
- He needs money the most.
- After everything Evan's been through

15:54.537 --> 15:56.760
with the house,
you think he'd steal the money ?

15:56.885 --> 15:58.235
Maybe it was you.

16:00.348 --> 16:02.085
So much for avoiding a witch-hunt.

16:08.356 --> 16:11.469
So Tom, what does
a music historian actually do ?

16:11.637 --> 16:14.078
I mostly just listen to music.

16:14.475 --> 16:16.182
Boring classically classical stuff ?

16:16.701 --> 16:19.022
Well, I have spent
the last three years

16:19.147 --> 16:21.855
working on Richard Strauss'
Die Agyptische Helena.

16:23.824 --> 16:27.250
- Talk about driving a man to drink.
- Yes ! That's true.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.951
- Do you have any ?
- Take mine.

16:29.076 --> 16:30.530
All right.
Thank you.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.757
You know, in my day,
we used to play a game

16:33.882 --> 16:36.953
that combined eight-ball
and beer pong and gambling.

16:37.122 --> 16:38.705
- Monkey-Hump ?
- Yes !

16:39.178 --> 16:41.166
- I'm undefeated.
- Are you ?

16:41.651 --> 16:42.626
So am I.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.372
Borg-ing commenced.

16:48.530 --> 16:49.674
You know, Tom...

16:50.971 --> 16:52.752
We were just talking about Cappie

16:52.877 --> 16:54.684
having so much trouble
picking a major.

16:54.809 --> 16:57.485
As a professor, you might be able
to give him some advice.

16:57.610 --> 16:59.851
Maybe you can discuss it
while you guys Monkey-Hump.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.187
I'd be more than happy
to help you with that.

17:10.719 --> 17:11.719
It's on.

17:21.853 --> 17:23.540
Can I help you with something ?

17:24.109 --> 17:25.085
No, thanks.

17:29.879 --> 17:32.230
- That was weird.
- I know. She said thanks.

17:32.355 --> 17:36.138
So I will go grab all the nametag stuff.
We have so much catching up to do.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.062
- The... ?
- For the dorm reunion ?

17:38.187 --> 17:40.058
My God !
I totally forgot.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.852
You probably forgot
to pick up the cups, too.

17:43.713 --> 17:44.771
I'm sorry.

17:45.249 --> 17:46.690
Joel blew apart

17:46.859 --> 17:49.734
my personal statement and I've been
trying to come up with a new topic.

17:50.418 --> 17:52.487
That sucks.
You should've told me.

17:52.655 --> 17:55.720
Maybe I can help.
It's all about marketing yourself.

17:55.845 --> 17:59.127
And who knows more about marketing
or yourself, than me and myself ?

17:59.252 --> 18:01.746
I know what your personal statement
should be about. Hi, ZBZ.

18:03.687 --> 18:07.656
Katherine is helping me,
and she already got into law school !

18:08.786 --> 18:11.124
- Awesome !
- The ban on sexual discrimination

18:11.249 --> 18:13.133
was added to the Civil
Rights Act of 1964

18:13.302 --> 18:15.249
by a senator who wanted
to defeat the bill.

18:15.374 --> 18:17.637
- But the bill passed, right ?
- Yes, it did.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.468
But just as justice
triumphed over cynicism,

18:20.593 --> 18:23.185
you do not let the negative
stereotypes of sority girls

18:23.310 --> 18:25.353
dissuade you from achieving

18:25.522 --> 18:27.624
- visionary objectives.
- That is perfect !

18:27.749 --> 18:29.073
Right, Ash ?

18:29.645 --> 18:30.358
Yeah.

18:30.989 --> 18:33.737
So I'll just go do those nametags.

18:33.906 --> 18:36.322
Looks like you guys
got this under control.

18:39.791 --> 18:41.578
Don't forget the cups, Case.

18:42.936 --> 18:43.663
Right.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.258
No problem.

18:55.450 --> 18:56.763
You have a second ?

18:56.888 --> 18:59.545
You wanna see this awesome video
of this robot hand ?

18:59.670 --> 19:01.420
That Katherine sent you ?

19:02.482 --> 19:04.711
She's kind of cool and interesting.

19:04.836 --> 19:06.940
I wish everyone felt that way.

19:07.065 --> 19:10.064
- I think Ashleigh's jealous of her.
- Then I can't help you.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.002
Guys don't get jealous. That way,
we have more time to invent things

19:13.127 --> 19:16.237
- and cure diseases.
- And start wars and light farts ?

19:16.406 --> 19:18.254
Well, thanks, Rus.
Big help.

19:18.773 --> 19:21.326
Where's Cappie ?
How's his major hunt going ?

19:21.495 --> 19:23.760
I think I may have found him
an academic adviser.

19:23.885 --> 19:24.662
Great !

19:24.831 --> 19:27.276
I don't want to sound like
one of those nagging girlfriends

19:27.401 --> 19:30.325
and it's not like I'm worried
he's gonna end up being...

19:30.450 --> 19:33.377
one of those 40-year-olds guys
still partying at the KT house...

19:35.380 --> 19:37.005
I'm starving !

19:38.953 --> 19:39.928
Gotta get up !

19:41.426 --> 19:42.263
Oh, man...

19:45.482 --> 19:48.144
That's not his academic adviser,
right ?

19:48.313 --> 19:50.207
No. That's...

19:51.275 --> 19:52.232
Pickle's dad.

19:57.245 --> 19:59.841
David Sedaris is doing a reading
on campus this weekend.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.658
- You wanna go ?
- Sounds fun.

20:04.593 --> 20:06.621
That was pretty gutsy of you,
taking on Trip.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.290
Why ?
Evan's my big brother.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.532
Haven't you thought
maybe he stole the money ?

20:11.657 --> 20:14.415
- He's broke. He needs the cash.
- And he has a job.

20:14.540 --> 20:17.155
As far as I know, he's not investing
in home hair products

20:17.280 --> 20:18.758
and velvet suits.

20:20.020 --> 20:23.562
- So now you think that I did it ?
- No, I'm just merely pointing out

20:23.687 --> 20:26.287
why we shouldn't be
throwing around blame.

20:26.996 --> 20:27.851
Hi, guys.

20:30.899 --> 20:32.975
- What are you doing ?
- Waiting for Evan.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.607
No, to the couch.

20:35.580 --> 20:38.653
- Redecorating.
- Let us know if you find $500 in there.

20:39.924 --> 20:42.367
Hey, feeling better ?

20:42.492 --> 20:44.993
Yeah, must've been one
of those 24 hour things.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.819
- I'm really hungry now.
- Okay, let's go.

20:49.445 --> 20:51.903
So we shouldn't be throwing
blame around, even though last night

20:52.028 --> 20:54.168
you were pissed that someone
stole from their brothers ?

20:54.337 --> 20:55.911
I don't like any of it, OK ?

20:56.036 --> 20:57.773
The money was stolen on my watch,

20:57.898 --> 21:00.848
so everyone's looking at me
to fix the situation.

21:02.048 --> 21:04.304
Maybe there's a way we can solve
both problems at once.

21:04.472 --> 21:07.640
Get the money back and not
publicly humiliate anyone.

21:12.626 --> 21:14.274
Tom didn't go home last night ?

21:14.399 --> 21:16.720
No, he told Margie he was up all night
grading papers.

21:16.845 --> 21:18.934
You're a genius, Spitter.
I think we Borged him.

21:19.059 --> 21:21.941
He dropped the curfews and told us not
to worry about the house-butt problem.

21:22.066 --> 21:25.670
So mission accomplished, right ?
You can send him home.

21:25.795 --> 21:27.571
No way, I made him
an honorary pledge.

21:27.696 --> 21:29.846
He came as Tom.
Now, he's T-Bag.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.565
So did T-Bag help you
with your major ?

21:32.690 --> 21:36.473
I found out what old people love more
than giving advice : being young people.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.173
I can't believe I Monkey-Humped you
twice last night.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.091
Do you guys ever do keg stands ?

21:42.689 --> 21:45.053
Hi, there.
Have you seen Tom ?

21:46.514 --> 21:48.526
No, we haven't, Mrs. Hilgendorf.

21:48.651 --> 21:51.184
May I say that blouse
brings out the color in your eyes ?

21:51.605 --> 21:54.020
And the lemon bars... to die for.

21:54.444 --> 21:55.855
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:56.024 --> 21:59.400
And if we see Tom, we'll be sure
to tell him you came by looking for him.

21:59.569 --> 22:02.070
Of course.
Have a nice day.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.407
Dude, thank you.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.096
She would've had my ass.

22:08.221 --> 22:10.495
And not in a...
Like in a good way.

22:10.664 --> 22:13.706
It's the least I can do for the best
academic adviser at CRU

22:14.523 --> 22:16.167
Do you wanna watch sports all day ?

22:16.336 --> 22:18.378
Okay !
Let me get my beers !

22:21.793 --> 22:24.926
- What's up, guys ?
- When's the old dude leaving ?

22:25.095 --> 22:26.928
Because if I wanted to spend time
with a guy

22:27.096 --> 22:29.639
old enough to be my dad,
I'd go home and hang with my dad.

22:29.808 --> 22:32.244
He's not doing too much
for Cappie at this point either.

22:32.369 --> 22:34.560
You invited him here,
so make him go.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.146
How ? Cappie already made him
an honorary pledge.

22:37.315 --> 22:40.274
You're Pledge Educator.
Just haze him until he quits.

22:43.101 --> 22:45.088
Pledge T-Bag ?
Yes ?

22:45.740 --> 22:46.698
Give me five ?

22:48.454 --> 22:49.784
These are mine.

22:51.546 --> 22:52.453
Pushups ?

22:53.170 --> 22:55.039
Hazing ! Fun !

22:55.208 --> 22:56.416
Okay, let's do them !

23:08.470 --> 23:10.596
- Five more ?
- OK. Wait a minute.

23:10.765 --> 23:13.516
Shouldn't all the other pledges
be doing this with me ?

23:15.102 --> 23:18.229
Sorry, guys.
Ten from everyone.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.978
Come on, you guys !

23:26.030 --> 23:27.030
Yeah.

23:27.765 --> 23:28.614
Good.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.658
I'll prepare the SOUF.

23:31.581 --> 23:33.161
What's that ?
What's the SOUF ?

23:34.496 --> 23:36.330
Smoothie Of Unidentified Fluids.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.916
And you're gonna love your costume.

23:45.141 --> 23:47.278
You should probably
start getting ready.

23:47.403 --> 23:50.178
Can I meet you there ?
I just want to read through this again.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.806
I thought "Gamma Psi"
figured it all out for you.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.535
Katherine has really smart advice.

23:57.660 --> 23:59.540
She's already gotten
into Yale Law and...

23:59.665 --> 24:02.054
she knows what the admissions
committees are looking for.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.815
But does she know you ?

24:03.985 --> 24:06.173
I gotta tell you,
when I think of Casey Cartwright,

24:06.298 --> 24:09.298
I'm not reminded
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.617
Well, it's a good thing you're not
on the admissions committees.

24:12.786 --> 24:16.659
Why is it even called a personal
statement, if it's just a bunch of BS ?

24:16.784 --> 24:19.707
Look, I don't care
if it's BS or personal.

24:19.876 --> 24:23.503
I just want to get into law school
and with Katherine's input, I will.

24:24.677 --> 24:26.377
You're sure about that ?

24:29.505 --> 24:30.895
I'm so sure,

24:31.506 --> 24:33.888
I am going to go with you
to that reunion.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.007
Great.
Don't forget the cups.

24:37.062 --> 24:38.062
Again.

24:40.326 --> 24:41.726
No dust.
Anywhere.

24:42.298 --> 24:45.198
Beaver, did you find
any jewelry in your room ?

24:45.323 --> 24:46.323
Leave.

24:47.828 --> 24:48.945
A silver necklace ?

24:49.614 --> 24:51.572
Why would that be in my room ?

24:52.787 --> 24:54.659
I think I lost it when we...

24:56.937 --> 24:57.987
You know...

24:59.522 --> 25:03.084
God, you're gonna make me say it.
When we had sex.

25:03.436 --> 25:06.212
We did do it !
I bet Wonder Woman really happened, too.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.674
Don't worry.
You were way better.

25:13.491 --> 25:14.891
What, I'm serious.

25:15.979 --> 25:18.057
You're charming
when you're not trying so hard.

25:18.299 --> 25:20.434
Wanna go upstairs
and lose your earrings ?

25:20.603 --> 25:23.903
And now you're back.
Come on, help me find my necklace.

25:29.426 --> 25:30.903
How's it going, Pledge T-Bag ?

25:31.071 --> 25:34.129
- What do I clean next ?
- You wanna play some beer pong ?

25:34.254 --> 25:36.868
He was just about to clean
underneath the pool table.

25:37.296 --> 25:38.744
Oh, you guys !

25:41.296 --> 25:43.791
So I think Tom has helped me
decide what to major in.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.168
- Really ?
- Yes.

25:45.337 --> 25:46.993
I wanna major in Tom.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.128
I want to be having that much fun
when I'm elderly. He's awesome.

25:52.253 --> 25:53.509
No, he isn't.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.762
He's creeping everybody out. Not to
mention, no girl will ever set foot

25:56.931 --> 25:59.901
in Kappa Tau once they know we're
recruiting senior citizens as pledges.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.667
Untrue. Girls love it here.
Look.

26:03.684 --> 26:06.397
What ? That's Dumptruck.
And who's he with ?

26:10.225 --> 26:11.225
Dad ?

26:11.741 --> 26:13.946
You're drinking ?
What is this ?

26:14.288 --> 26:16.031
I can't find my necklace.

26:17.209 --> 26:19.259
- Noise disturbance !
- Huck ?

26:19.454 --> 26:20.703
Oh no, campus cops.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.540
- Officer Huck.
- Hucky !

26:24.708 --> 26:26.209
The old Huckster !

26:42.351 --> 26:46.355
I couldn't do it all by myself. Kinda
like you and your personal statement.

26:47.092 --> 26:49.321
Well, this'll be a fun
walk down memory lane.

26:49.446 --> 26:52.046
I'm gonna go put these
by the punch bowl.

26:53.576 --> 26:54.576
My God !

26:56.037 --> 26:58.574
And Ashleigh ?
Is that you ?

26:59.046 --> 27:00.405
It is.
Hi, Sunny.

27:00.530 --> 27:02.823
Well, I haven't seen you guys
in, like, forever !

27:02.948 --> 27:05.713
- What have you been up to these days ?
- Ashleigh was just talking

27:05.838 --> 27:08.626
about how she made
these nametags all by herself.

27:08.794 --> 27:11.128
So cute.
And what about you ?

27:11.490 --> 27:13.464
Well, she's applying to law school.

27:13.633 --> 27:16.634
It's a visionary objective and nothing
will stop her from achieving it.

27:19.553 --> 27:21.504
You two really stuck together.
You know...

27:21.629 --> 27:24.724
I've lost touch with almost everyone
from the dorm.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.365
- We've been roommates.
- That explains it.

27:27.490 --> 27:30.434
You can't help be friends with
the people you live with. Kind of like

27:30.559 --> 27:32.814
how we were all friends because
the university randomly

27:32.939 --> 27:36.195
assigned us to Pierson. It's not like
we had a ton in common or anything !

27:37.865 --> 27:40.449
I guess that's why reunions
are so awkward.

27:40.618 --> 27:43.588
If you wanted awkward, you should've
been at the ZBZ house last night.

27:43.713 --> 27:45.705
Casey was under some serious
mind control.

27:46.476 --> 27:48.768
- Were you playing Ouija ?
- All she was doing

27:48.893 --> 27:51.669
was helping with my statement,
which is the key to my whole future.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.463
Which evidently is more important
than your past.

27:54.632 --> 27:56.739
What is your problem ?
Why are you so jealous ?

27:56.864 --> 27:59.385
This isn't about Katherine.
And my problem is

27:59.554 --> 28:03.557
that we're not on the same page at all
anymore and you don't even realize it.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.163
It was great to see you both again.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.424
If Huck finds out
we have a 16-year-old girl

28:19.549 --> 28:22.873
hanging out at the house with alcohol,
we'll be kicked off the Row.

28:22.998 --> 28:25.411
And my dad'll get fired
for partying with students.

28:25.579 --> 28:27.066
Relax, it's just Huck.

28:27.191 --> 28:30.100
We've Dewey and Anthony Hopkins
keeping him occupied inside.

28:30.225 --> 28:32.348
We'll just walk our
Hilgendorfs out the back gate

28:32.473 --> 28:35.223
and in through their front door,
all right ?

28:37.959 --> 28:38.959
Open it !

28:41.101 --> 28:42.728
Over the fence.

28:43.587 --> 28:45.487
Who's going over the fence ?

28:47.684 --> 28:48.984
One, two, three.

28:50.377 --> 28:52.313
- Up, up !
- This was a bad idea !

28:52.481 --> 28:54.732
A lot of broken glass there.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.902
- It seems quiet to me.
- That's because you're a civilian.

28:58.296 --> 29:00.346
Every night, I train my ears...

29:00.866 --> 29:02.405
to detect a pin drop.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.009
By dropping pins.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.937
And that was not a pin.

29:15.467 --> 29:17.017
What are they doing ?

29:19.744 --> 29:20.744
Tai chi.

29:29.064 --> 29:30.114
And exhale.

29:30.728 --> 29:31.519
Namaste.

29:31.965 --> 29:33.015
Breathe in.

29:34.694 --> 29:36.482
What ?
I took a Learning Annex class.

29:41.714 --> 29:44.406
Hey, guys !
You forgot to unhook the latch.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.736
I just landed in the garden.
Our tomatoes are doing great.

29:51.834 --> 29:52.873
Mom's home !

29:54.792 --> 29:57.492
Maybe she won't be
that angry with T-Bag...

29:57.701 --> 29:59.296
T-Dad... your dad.

29:59.795 --> 30:00.897
Are you kidding ?

30:01.022 --> 30:03.797
If she finds out, she'll divorce Dad,
send me off to boarding school

30:03.922 --> 30:05.886
- and shut your house down.
- Okay, plan B.

30:06.054 --> 30:09.454
Rebecca, you and Beav stall Mom.
We'll get them upstairs.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.079
I'll open a window.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.383
This is not a part of Plan B.

30:15.508 --> 30:17.558
I didn't hear anything about...

30:20.032 --> 30:20.901
What's up ?

30:21.070 --> 30:23.433
We are giving whoever did this
a chance to return the money

30:23.558 --> 30:25.971
- without all the finger-pointing.
- Everyone gets an envelope,

30:26.096 --> 30:28.993
which we all have to place
in a sealed box in the Chapter Room.

30:29.162 --> 30:31.495
Whoever stole the money can return it
without anyone knowing.

30:31.620 --> 30:34.530
And as long as it's returned,
there's no need to punish anyone.

30:34.655 --> 30:36.055
Makes sense to me.

30:46.975 --> 30:48.262
Mrs. Hilgendorf, hi !

30:48.431 --> 30:50.670
I'm Rebecca Logan,
ZBZ's Welcome Wagon.

30:50.795 --> 30:53.845
- I'm Beaver, and I'm with her.
- Trying too hard.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.793
Watch your head.

30:56.918 --> 30:59.190
So, what were Rebecca and
Beaver doing upstairs ?

30:59.359 --> 31:01.400
Taking cultures for her bio class.

31:01.569 --> 31:04.951
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think they slept together.

31:05.076 --> 31:07.323
- They did ?
- Leave it alone, Spitter.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.659
- This looks like my house !
- That's because it is.

31:10.827 --> 31:11.869
That's my bed.

31:13.163 --> 31:16.147
- We're gonna put you in bed.
- Good idea. I'm tired.

31:16.272 --> 31:19.293
- Let's get you in there.
- Guys, I'm really tired.

31:23.112 --> 31:24.882
We should, like, grab a movie.

31:25.355 --> 31:27.468
- Stay away from my daughter !
- Dad !

31:32.364 --> 31:34.642
- He's all tucked in.
- Spray him and get out of here.

31:39.073 --> 31:41.789
We could use Rebecca and Beaver
to get back at Evan

31:41.914 --> 31:44.118
- for getting the guys expelled.
- We're gonna get back

31:44.243 --> 31:46.105
at all the Omega Chis for that
and when we do,

31:46.230 --> 31:48.531
we won't need to drag
anybody else into it.

31:49.428 --> 31:51.528
We gotta lose the costume, guys.

31:52.561 --> 31:53.711
Get his hat !

31:55.527 --> 31:57.915
Sorry, did you say
your name was Beaver ?

31:58.693 --> 32:00.251
It's short for "The Beaver."

32:01.351 --> 32:02.795
If you'll excuse me...

32:04.730 --> 32:06.340
Look up here !
Look up here !

32:07.140 --> 32:09.184
That was the signal.
We gotta hurry up.

32:09.681 --> 32:10.881
Just a call...

32:12.853 --> 32:14.253
It's a... welcome.

32:14.546 --> 32:15.596
Good night.

32:19.328 --> 32:21.128
That's Rebecca's necklace.

32:30.407 --> 32:31.807
- Are you OK ?
- No !

32:33.788 --> 32:35.138
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

32:41.275 --> 32:42.543
Time to go to bed.

32:48.466 --> 32:50.561
And there are two of
us in this friendship.

32:50.686 --> 32:52.816
So it can't be all my fault, right ?

32:52.941 --> 32:56.010
- It's possible, but not very probable.
- I know !

32:56.962 --> 32:58.475
I mean, yes, I have

32:58.643 --> 33:01.122
been a little focused on law school,

33:01.247 --> 33:03.400
but she's been dealing
with other stuff, too.

33:03.525 --> 33:06.525
Who's to say which one of us turned
the page when the other wasn't looking ?

33:06.693 --> 33:08.703
I've never been on
the same page with anyone.

33:08.828 --> 33:12.082
I joined GP only for the networking
connections after college. But Casey,

33:12.207 --> 33:15.159
- I do consider you to be...
- On the same page ?

33:15.594 --> 33:17.161
I was gonna say a friend.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.442
So we're friends ?

33:21.702 --> 33:25.461
Yes and I was thinking that maybe one
day we could be the kind of friends

33:25.629 --> 33:27.546
- could read each other's...
- Minds ?

33:27.980 --> 33:29.214
I was gonna say books.

33:29.826 --> 33:30.617
Right.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.552
But I think it takes a little
bit to get on the same page.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.888
Have you read the recent
works of Alice Munro ?

33:40.477 --> 33:42.978
- The recent works ?
- No.

33:43.146 --> 33:44.440
This is a first edition.

33:44.565 --> 33:48.150
I just wrote my name on the inside
cover so you know who to return it to.

33:50.314 --> 33:51.111
Thanks.

33:54.931 --> 33:57.227
And I'm sorry that you
and Ashleigh have grown apart.

33:57.352 --> 33:59.702
But it happens to a lot of people
at the end of college.

34:00.707 --> 34:03.468
Maybe some people should
be around your entire life,

34:03.593 --> 34:06.001
and others should just
make an appearance.

34:26.022 --> 34:27.511
Dryer sheets and...

34:28.126 --> 34:29.126
and...

34:29.956 --> 34:30.775
Mold.

34:32.638 --> 34:33.638
Yeah.

34:35.905 --> 34:37.783
Well, Sunny seemed sunny.

34:37.951 --> 34:39.625
No one should smile that much.

34:39.918 --> 34:42.329
She's gonna need Botox
by the time she's 25.

34:42.496 --> 34:43.789
Or a lobotomy.

34:47.540 --> 34:49.293
I can't believe this
is where we met.

34:49.664 --> 34:52.975
- And where we met Frannie.
- You had to say the "F" word.

34:54.425 --> 34:58.204
How different would college
have been without this ten-foot,

34:58.329 --> 35:00.338
poorly-ventilated and moldy room ?

35:01.016 --> 35:03.057
Things were a lot easier back then.

35:04.064 --> 35:04.935
For us.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.625
Yeah, we were freshmen.

35:06.750 --> 35:10.679
Our biggest concern was whether
or not the dryer was eating our socks.

35:12.449 --> 35:13.449
And now ?

35:14.078 --> 35:14.945
Now...

35:15.951 --> 35:17.920
we both have a lot more going on.

35:18.634 --> 35:20.181
Boyfriends in different houses,

35:20.306 --> 35:22.185
schedules that demand our attention,

35:22.310 --> 35:24.955
plans after graduation
that are changing our priorities.

35:26.278 --> 35:28.228
We'll have to work harder to...

35:28.353 --> 35:29.918
stay on the same page.

35:30.614 --> 35:32.794
We never had to work at it before.

35:34.118 --> 35:35.118
I know.

35:36.098 --> 35:37.098
I know.

35:40.791 --> 35:42.432
Do you think that Sunny was right ?

35:42.557 --> 35:45.157
We're only friends
because of geography ?

35:46.887 --> 35:49.289
Maybe that's why we became friends,

35:49.414 --> 35:51.482
but I don't think it's
why we stayed friends.

35:53.154 --> 35:55.068
You don't think
that we're growing apart ?

35:57.527 --> 35:58.947
I think we're growing up.

36:00.434 --> 36:02.941
Ash, I don't want to live in the past.
Not with you.

36:03.539 --> 36:06.398
- Because if we did, we'd still be...
- In this laundry room ?

36:11.851 --> 36:14.296
Well, I can still read your mind.

36:18.234 --> 36:19.234
So who...

36:20.191 --> 36:21.720
is Alice Munro ?

36:22.453 --> 36:23.484
You know...

36:24.386 --> 36:25.224
no clue.

36:32.268 --> 36:34.918
But we got away with it,
that's something.

36:36.616 --> 36:37.528
Not really.

36:38.327 --> 36:40.155
Guys, I'm a 40-year-old man

36:40.280 --> 36:42.741
and I just had to rely on
a bunch of guys in their twenties

36:42.909 --> 36:44.910
to rescue me
and my 16-year-old daughter.

36:45.078 --> 36:46.078
I'm 19.

36:47.244 --> 36:48.405
Way to rub it in.

36:48.979 --> 36:50.791
- Sorry about hazing you.
- No.

36:51.451 --> 36:53.338
No reason to be.
You guys are great.

36:53.463 --> 36:55.471
I just don't think
I'm supposed to be here.

36:55.596 --> 36:57.548
- But you're T-Bag.
- No.

36:58.424 --> 36:59.584
I'm just Dad,

36:59.947 --> 37:01.857
and sometimes Professor Hilgendorf.

37:02.796 --> 37:04.776
No offense, but that's depressing.

37:05.198 --> 37:07.933
Yeah, to you, it is.
But I like my life, really.

37:08.101 --> 37:10.023
And while it was fun to play around,

37:10.148 --> 37:12.312
I belong on the other
side of the fence.

37:15.216 --> 37:17.233
- What about the rules ?
- Forget about that.

37:17.358 --> 37:19.319
College is not supposed
to be about rules.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.637
You guys have your fun.
As a matter of fact,

37:21.762 --> 37:24.658
have a lot of fun and I will live
vicariously through you.

37:25.030 --> 37:28.124
Well, Tom, the table's always open
if you want to get Monkey-Humped.

37:28.714 --> 37:31.069
No, I think I'm gonna
retire undefeated.

37:31.784 --> 37:33.000
Too bad you won't.

37:37.350 --> 37:38.733
Come on, tell me the truth.

37:39.632 --> 37:41.498
You're gonna miss all this,
aren't you ?

37:42.635 --> 37:43.854
Yeah, I'll miss it.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.180
But it's never
the same after you leave.

37:48.037 --> 37:49.766
The truth is you can't go back.

37:50.264 --> 37:52.045
So enjoy it while you can.

37:57.144 --> 38:00.152
Sorry Tom didn't turn out
to be much of an adviser.

38:02.049 --> 38:03.155
You know, Spitter,

38:04.744 --> 38:06.325
he actually made a lot of sense.

38:23.011 --> 38:24.861
And our books are balanced.

38:25.683 --> 38:26.683
Great.

38:27.722 --> 38:28.765
OK. Well,

38:29.667 --> 38:30.886
that ends that.

38:32.242 --> 38:33.242
No...

38:33.847 --> 38:34.770
not quite.

38:35.347 --> 38:37.814
You see, Grant didn't trust you,
but I did.

38:38.090 --> 38:40.410
I told him he was wrong to
think you stole that money.

38:40.738 --> 38:42.319
I told Trip that, too.

38:43.586 --> 38:44.696
What you getting at ?

38:45.918 --> 38:47.054
I trusted you.

38:50.273 --> 38:51.745
I marked the envelope to prove

38:51.913 --> 38:53.622
that you didn't steal the money.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.617
I need to buy Rebecca present.

39:01.742 --> 39:03.966
- I was gonna pay the house back.
- Forget it.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.438
I don't even care.

39:08.775 --> 39:10.430
This isn't an excuse,

39:11.447 --> 39:15.435
but I've been surrounded by money
my entire life, including here.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.030
I guess I'm still
getting used to it.

39:21.202 --> 39:22.713
It's like you said,

39:23.534 --> 39:25.112
living in the straight world.

39:26.299 --> 39:28.209
Please tell me you
didn't just compare me

39:28.334 --> 39:31.159
listening to Lady Gaga to you
being a thief and a liar.

39:31.327 --> 39:33.954
No, that...
That's not what I meant.

39:36.425 --> 39:37.807
Cal, I'm sorry.

39:39.729 --> 39:41.294
I just hoped you could understand.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.491
I just don't think you understand.

39:44.311 --> 39:46.216
You gave up that trust fund up

39:46.384 --> 39:49.130
because you didn't like what
that money was turning you into.

39:49.255 --> 39:51.646
I'm just starting to think
the money wasn't the problem.

39:55.954 --> 39:57.524
Well, you're not expelled.

39:57.758 --> 39:59.891
We live to party another day.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.446
Thank you, by the way.

40:02.821 --> 40:03.821
And...

40:06.965 --> 40:08.148
you're welcome.

40:10.762 --> 40:12.191
Why is there hair in it ?

40:12.508 --> 40:15.168
That's the hair of
a champion Monkey-Humper.

40:18.562 --> 40:20.571
Don't you think you're giving Evan
the wrong idea

40:20.696 --> 40:23.295
by keeping that when you
don't feel the same way he does ?

40:23.463 --> 40:26.004
Evan knew how I felt about
that stuff from the start.

40:28.477 --> 40:30.750
And I don't want to get
so serious with him.

40:32.004 --> 40:33.805
Or with anyone, for that matter.

40:35.051 --> 40:37.875
It's easier and I'm just
not that kind of person.

40:38.645 --> 40:41.519
Why is it so hard to just keep
everything casual and fun ?

40:43.512 --> 40:45.400
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt.

40:45.568 --> 40:46.973
I'm the one angsting here.

40:47.098 --> 40:49.361
I'm just not sure I'm ready
to graduate and leave here

40:49.582 --> 40:51.578
and become the Hilgendorfs.

40:52.703 --> 40:54.144
The whole idea is...

40:54.779 --> 40:57.321
soul-sucking and kind of scary.

40:58.728 --> 40:59.706
I hear ya.

41:00.368 --> 41:02.079
So, what about you and Casey ?

41:03.064 --> 41:05.293
I thought you didn't want
to be anywhere she isn't.

41:05.418 --> 41:07.973
Well, if she gets into CRU law,
then it won't be an issue

41:08.220 --> 41:09.415
for a while.

41:10.599 --> 41:11.970
And if she doesn't ?

41:13.786 --> 41:15.029
I don't really know.

41:15.154 --> 41:17.099
But I can't figure it
all out today, Becks.

41:17.267 --> 41:20.056
So I'm just gonna hang here
and enjoy the sunshine.

41:21.322 --> 41:22.979
Sounds like a plan to me.

41:23.147 --> 41:24.147
Oh, yeah.

41:25.962 --> 41:27.908
Sounds like quite a laundry room.

41:29.970 --> 41:32.364
The Backstreet Boys
were already taken.

41:32.911 --> 41:35.068
And you never found the sock ?

41:36.122 --> 41:39.954
No, but I realized that legal precedent
isn't all that different from nostalgia.

41:40.079 --> 41:42.165
The law builds on the past

41:42.333 --> 41:44.515
and I wouldn't be who I am,

41:44.640 --> 41:46.320
if it weren't for that laundry room.

41:46.542 --> 41:49.191
And if I had dated
a girl who preferred

41:49.316 --> 41:52.730
U2 to the Backstreet Boys,
I might not be divorced.

41:53.004 --> 41:54.446
It's an interesting theory.

41:54.571 --> 41:56.801
Interesting,
as in "this girl belongs in law school"

41:56.926 --> 41:58.765
or "this girl belongs
in a Laundromat" ?

41:59.450 --> 42:01.268
I think you know the answer to that.

42:03.274 --> 42:04.104
Thank you.

42:09.438 --> 42:10.438
Thanks.
