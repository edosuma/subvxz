00:02.003 --> 00:03.664
Previously on Lost:

00:03.754 --> 00:05.619
You're the son of a bitch
who shot my kid.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.545
Pick him up. Get him to the spring.

00:12.555 --> 00:14.887
You're not saving him!
You're drowning him!

00:16.434 --> 00:18.891
- Your friend is dead.
- Jack!

00:21.272 --> 00:23.012
What happened?

00:23.107 --> 00:24.313
What is it you want?

00:26.235 --> 00:28.817
I don't have any secrets.
Why are you doing this?

00:32.575 --> 00:34.361
You have to give your friend this pill.

00:34.452 --> 00:35.862
What is in it?

00:35.953 --> 00:38.205
- Poison.
- Why would you people wanna kill Sayid?

00:38.289 --> 00:40.530
There is a darkness growing in him.

00:40.625 --> 00:44.163
And once it reaches his heart...
everything your friend once was...

00:44.253 --> 00:47.165
- ...will be gone.
- What are you hiding from me?

00:47.256 --> 00:50.714
The pill was poison.
They wanted me to kill you.

00:58.643 --> 01:00.554
The meter doesn't stop
until you get out.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.350
Keep the change.

01:26.796 --> 01:27.831
Sayid.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.795
Hello, Nadia.

01:38.808 --> 01:41.891
- You're here!
- Where were you, Uncle Sayid?

01:41.978 --> 01:44.765
- l was in Sydney.
- Where's Sydney?

01:44.855 --> 01:46.356
In Australia.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.981
You bring flowers for my wife?

01:52.446 --> 01:54.061
I'll give them to you, if you want.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.070
It's good to see you, Sayid.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.573
- It's good to see you, too, Brother.
- Come.

02:07.670 --> 02:10.377
Uncle Sayid, what did you
bring us from Australia?

02:11.299 --> 02:13.130
Go look in my bag. It's on the couch.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.837
It's good you came, Sayid.
They've missed you.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.593
We're lucky he even showed up.

02:21.684 --> 02:24.801
The world traveler off on
his exotic business trips.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.147
Translating contracts for an oil company

02:27.231 --> 02:30.894
is hardly exotic...
and it's painfully dull.

02:30.985 --> 02:34.569
There's very little adventure
in the world of dry cleaning.

02:35.364 --> 02:38.902
He's being modest.
Omer's just opened up a new store.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.529
Congratulations.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.703
I thought we talked about
cell phones at the dinner table.

02:47.752 --> 02:50.539
Dinner is over. This is business.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.793
Yes?

03:00.431 --> 03:02.262
Did you get my letters?

03:03.726 --> 03:06.763
- Yes.
- You never wrote back.

03:11.025 --> 03:15.109
- These are awesome! Thanks!
- You're welcome.

03:15.196 --> 03:18.984
Mommy, we found a picture of you
in Uncle Sayid's bag.

03:47.728 --> 03:48.968
I want to talk to you.

03:50.981 --> 03:54.223
- I want some answers.
- Answers to what?

03:55.986 --> 03:57.817
Let's start with that machine.

04:02.993 --> 04:05.370
You hooked me up to this thing...

04:07.456 --> 04:12.416
...you stuck needles in me,
and you called it a test.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.256
For every man, there is a scale.

04:18.384 --> 04:21.171
On one side of the scale, there is good.

04:22.430 --> 04:25.172
On the other side, evil.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.598
This machine tells us
how the scale is balanced.

04:33.023 --> 04:37.892
And yours... tipped the wrong way.

04:37.987 --> 04:40.103
And that's why you tried to poison me?

04:42.116 --> 04:43.697
Yes.

04:44.952 --> 04:48.240
I think it would be best
if you were dead.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.498
You think you know me, but you don't.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.256
I'm a good man.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.088
So if you're trying to kill me...

06:13.332 --> 06:14.742
Go.

06:15.459 --> 06:17.290
Leave this place.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.957
Never come back.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.571
Are you ready?

06:52.871 --> 06:54.077
Why does it have to me be?

06:54.164 --> 06:56.155
I mean, you could send
Sawyer or Jin or...

06:57.042 --> 06:58.031
...do it yourself.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.510
lfl go in there, I need to know
you'll do what you said.

07:10.347 --> 07:14.260
- I want my son back.
- | always do what I say.

07:23.736 --> 07:26.853
- Are you gonna hurt them?
- Only the ones who won't listen.

08:05.569 --> 08:09.312
- It's me. Calm down.
- What are you doing?

08:09.406 --> 08:11.488
It's 2:30 in the morning.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.112
Sayid, I'm in trouble.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.211
What kind of trouble?

08:25.214 --> 08:28.001
I borrowed money
to open the second store.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.544
But...

08:31.720 --> 08:33.802
I didn't borrow it from the bank.

08:33.889 --> 08:37.131
I paid the loan back,
but the man who lent me this money,

08:37.226 --> 08:39.808
he says I still owe him interest
every month...

08:40.938 --> 08:43.429
...for as long as I own my business.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.896
- If you need money, l'll lend it...
- I don't need money, Sayid.

08:48.737 --> 08:52.150
I need you to convince
these people to leave me alone.

08:52.241 --> 08:55.483
- "Convince" them?
- Don't forget who you're talking to.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.613
I know what you did in the war.

08:58.956 --> 09:02.073
You were an interrogator
for the Republican Guard.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.002
I know what kind of man you are.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.540
If you think I'm going to hurt someone

09:11.635 --> 09:13.671
because you made
a bad business decision...

09:13.762 --> 09:17.801
This is not about me! Our life savings,
it's all gone, Sayid. All of it.

09:17.975 --> 09:21.559
We could lose our home. Please.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.388
Look... I know you care about Nadia.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.979
If you care about us, about her...

09:32.364 --> 09:34.446
...you will do this, Sayid.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.658
I'm sorry.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.121
I'm not that man anymore.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.520
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

10:07.483 --> 10:08.598
I've been banished.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.608
Banished? For what?

10:12.529 --> 10:16.147
Apparently, l'm evil.
These people say I'm better off dead.

10:17.034 --> 10:20.697
Which is surprising, considering
they were the ones who saved my life.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.154
Well, actually, they're not.

10:24.041 --> 10:27.499
They... They tried to save you, but...

10:30.255 --> 10:31.836
You were dead, man.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.377
For two hours.

10:35.052 --> 10:39.045
Trust me, when you sat up, they were
just as surprised as the rest of us.

10:40.432 --> 10:44.220
So whatever brought you back,
it wasn't them.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.396
Hold it.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.068
Stop! Don't shoot her!

10:58.951 --> 11:00.316
What are you doing here?

11:01.787 --> 11:02.776
He wants to see you.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.662
Speak English.

11:09.795 --> 11:12.332
- Who wants to see me?
- You know who.

11:12.422 --> 11:16.586
If he wants to see me,
then tell him to come in.

11:16.677 --> 11:20.386
No, he wants you to go to him. He's
waiting outside, beyond the outer wall.

11:20.472 --> 11:21.712
I'm not a fool.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.682
lfl step outside this Temple...

11:27.187 --> 11:28.302
...he'll kill me.

11:28.939 --> 11:31.476
Well, then maybe you should
send someone he won't kill.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.570
Stop her!

11:41.785 --> 11:43.776
That's gonna be a little difficult.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.866
We can't find them.

11:51.003 --> 11:52.539
Come on!

12:00.429 --> 12:01.464
Come with me.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.759
I thought you wanted me to leave.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.095
Things have changed.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.778
Your friends, Shephard and Reyes...

12:27.497 --> 12:30.660
- Do you know where they went?
- No, I don't.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.578
Why is Claire here?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.043
And what was she talking about?

12:41.219 --> 12:46.634
She's a confused girl,
under the influence of an angry man.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.018
What man?

12:50.312 --> 12:54.271
For years, he has been trapped.

12:54.900 --> 12:58.518
But now Jacob's gone. He's free.

12:59.821 --> 13:04.406
This man will not stop
until he has destroyed

13:04.493 --> 13:07.530
every living thing on this island.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.578
He is evil incarnate.

13:12.376 --> 13:15.868
- And you want me to speak to him?
- No.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.708
I want you to kill him.

13:21.677 --> 13:24.760
He will come to you as someone you know.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.220
Someone who has died.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.340
As soon as you see him...

13:31.728 --> 13:35.266
...plunge this deep into his chest.

13:36.066 --> 13:40.776
If you allow him to speak,
it is already too late.

13:41.863 --> 13:47.403
Since I've been here, I've been drowned,
beaten and tortured at your hands.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.903
Why would I ever do anything for you?

13:51.915 --> 13:55.578
You said that there is
still good in your soul.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.083
Then prove it.

14:07.139 --> 14:09.926
- Hey, wait up!
- How long are you staying, Uncle Sayid?

14:12.477 --> 14:13.887
Just a few more days.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.476
l have to go to Toronto... to work.

14:19.109 --> 14:23.102
- We like it when you're here.
- Yeah, and Mommy likes it, too.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.609
OK. Be good.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.764
Sayid!

14:55.395 --> 14:59.308
...attending to OR 2.
...attending to OR 2.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.479
Omer!

15:01.568 --> 15:03.900
- Is my husband all right?
- We're taking him to surgery.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.228
He's suffered a punctured lung,
internal bleeding.

15:06.323 --> 15:09.235
- Do you know how this happened?
- EMTs think he was mugged.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.862
I'll get you as soon as he's stable.

15:12.120 --> 15:15.863
- Sayid! Where are you going?
- Stay here with Omer.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.164
This wasn't a mugging, was it?

15:19.669 --> 15:21.830
Whatever you're thinking of doing...

15:22.756 --> 15:23.962
...don't do it.

15:25.467 --> 15:29.301
I don't want you to. Please... just...

15:30.013 --> 15:35.383
...go home, wait for the kids.
Make them feel safe, Sayid.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.931
Will you do that?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.534
Hello?

15:54.412 --> 15:57.199
- Sayid?
- Hello, Kate.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.156
Are you leaving?

16:02.838 --> 16:04.044
I am not exactly sure.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.751
- What'd I miss?
- Ask Miles.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.974
Thank you.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.115
Wow.

16:36.872 --> 16:39.909
- It's good to see you, too, Miles.
- Sawyer sent you packing?

16:44.546 --> 16:50.166
I thought about going after him, too.
But I knew he'd just end up berating me

16:50.260 --> 16:52.216
until I turned around and came back.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.011
That pretty much what happened?

16:57.684 --> 17:02.929
- Pretty much.
- Well... Welcome back to the circus.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.480
- What's going on in here?
- Well, let's see...

17:06.735 --> 17:10.068
- That Australian chick's back.
- Wait. What?

17:10.155 --> 17:12.692
You know, the blonde,
one that had the baby.

17:13.283 --> 17:15.239
- Claire?
- Right. Claire.

17:16.286 --> 17:20.620
She just strolled in here
a couple hours ago, acting all weird.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.787
Still hot, though.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.621
Miles, where is she?

17:26.796 --> 17:27.922
Where is she?

18:18.390 --> 18:19.379
Hello, Sayid.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.860
Now why'd you go and do that?

18:57.971 --> 18:59.632
You want it back?

19:01.725 --> 19:03.306
Take it. I won't bite.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.647
What are you?

19:11.735 --> 19:14.226
Well, Sayid, you seem
to have some idea about that,

19:14.321 --> 19:18.405
considering that you stabbed me
in the chest without even saying hello.

19:21.036 --> 19:24.620
- What did they tell you?
- They said you were evil incarnate.

19:26.750 --> 19:27.956
| feel sorry for you.

19:32.297 --> 19:36.506
- Why?
- Dogen, the man who sent you out here,

19:36.593 --> 19:39.801
knew that you had no chance
of killing me.

19:39.888 --> 19:43.005
And he believed that I would
kill you if you tried.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.353
This wasn't the first time

19:47.437 --> 19:49.894
he tried to get someone else
to do it for him, was it?

19:51.274 --> 19:53.606
- No.
- Then shame on you

19:53.693 --> 19:55.775
for being talked into it so easily.

19:57.405 --> 20:00.192
And what is it you
are trying to talk me into?

20:00.283 --> 20:03.525
- Sorry?
- You haven't killed me.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.700
- Clearly, there's something you want.
- | just want you

20:07.791 --> 20:09.622
to deliver a message, that's all.

20:09.709 --> 20:13.543
- Why didn't you have Claire deliver it?
- It'd mean a lot more coming from you.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.163
Sayid, if you'll do this for me...

20:21.930 --> 20:24.592
What if I told you that you
could have anything you wanted?

20:27.894 --> 20:31.478
What if I said you could have
anything in the entire world?

20:33.316 --> 20:39.277
I would tell you that the only thing
I ever wanted died in my arms.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.150
And I'll never see it again.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.280
But what if you could?

21:09.185 --> 21:13.019
We had an unfortunate incident
involving a boomerang.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.608
My apologies.

21:21.990 --> 21:25.858
- What time did the kids go to bed?
- About two hours ago.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.611
And what did you tell them?

21:29.706 --> 21:33.699
Daddy had an accident,
but that he's going to be fine.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.045
He's still recovering
from surgery, but...

21:40.341 --> 21:41.501
...he's awake now.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.506
- Did he tell you about the loan?
- Look, l have money.

21:49.601 --> 21:54.140
No. This is Omer's responsibility.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.812
He brought this on himself.

22:04.199 --> 22:06.235
Why didn't you want to be with me?

22:10.079 --> 22:12.912
You carry my picture around
with you, Sayid.

22:15.418 --> 22:19.957
If you care about me, why did you
push me towards your brother?

22:29.349 --> 22:32.762
For the last 12 years,
I've been trying to wash my hands...

22:33.895 --> 22:35.851
...of all the horrible things I've done.

22:40.401 --> 22:42.187
I can't be with you...

22:47.283 --> 22:49.274
...because I don't deserve you.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.469
What happened?

23:12.225 --> 23:14.386
There is a man in the jungle,

23:16.104 --> 23:19.312
about a mile south of us,
by the outer wall.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.526
He sent me back here
to give you a message.

23:24.112 --> 23:26.103
He wants you to know that Jacob is dead.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.735
And, because he's gone,

23:29.826 --> 23:32.784
none of you have to stay here
any longer. You're free.

23:34.122 --> 23:37.865
The man that I met
is leaving the island forever.

23:39.210 --> 23:43.294
And those of you who want to go with him
should leave the Temple and join him.

23:45.008 --> 23:49.593
- You have until sundown to decide.
- What happens at sundown if we stay?

23:51.097 --> 23:52.257
You die.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.685
Hey!

24:04.444 --> 24:06.776
When did you get back?
Are Ford and Kwon with you?

24:06.863 --> 24:09.149
- Where is Claire?
- OK, I need you to tell me

24:09.240 --> 24:11.822
- what I need to know before I...
- I said, where is Claire?

24:13.745 --> 24:16.782
All right. Just let go of me, OK?

24:24.380 --> 24:26.041
You got two minutes.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.350
Claire?

24:49.989 --> 24:52.901
- Claire, it's me.
- Kate?

24:55.078 --> 24:56.318
Are you OK?

24:57.163 --> 24:58.869
I can't believe you're here.

25:00.291 --> 25:03.328
- Did they capture you, too?
- No. No, they...

25:04.671 --> 25:06.332
Why did they put you down here?

25:07.340 --> 25:08.455
What happened?

25:08.549 --> 25:10.414
They have my son, Kate.
They have Aaron.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.091
- They took him from me.
- No. No.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.635
Claire, they don't have Aaron.

25:16.683 --> 25:17.923
I took him.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.514
- What?
- I took him off the island.

25:23.523 --> 25:26.765
You were gone,
and we couldn't find you. So...

25:28.945 --> 25:29.934
...I raised him.

25:32.240 --> 25:37.280
And... he is the most beautiful,
amazing little boy.

25:38.746 --> 25:41.954
But I came back here to rescue you
so that you could be with him,

25:42.041 --> 25:44.202
so that you guys
could be together again.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.045
I'm not the one that needs
to be rescued, Kate.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.414
Time's up. Let's go.

25:52.260 --> 25:53.796
No! No! Wait!

25:53.886 --> 25:55.968
- No! Wait! Wait!
- You wanted to see her.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.261
So let's go.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.888
He's coming, Kate.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.476
He's coming, and they can't stop him!

26:07.150 --> 26:08.640
All right, hurry!

26:10.945 --> 26:13.903
Everybody, calm down!
It's going to be OK.

26:13.990 --> 26:17.482
No! No! Wait! Hang on! Hey!

26:18.870 --> 26:21.486
Hey, you created a panic here.
Our people are leaving.

26:21.581 --> 26:25.415
l was asked to deliver a message,
and that's what I did.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.287
What your people do now is up to them.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.127
Cindy, just wait.

26:30.214 --> 26:33.001
You're safe here. As long we stay
in the Temple, he can't touch us.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.504
You heard him. Jacob's dead.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.803
And if it isn't safe here anymore,
we can't take that risk.

26:41.893 --> 26:43.258
Everyone, listen!

26:43.352 --> 26:46.344
This is a bluff!
He can't come in!

26:46.856 --> 26:49.723
- He can't come in!
- Hey. What happened out there?

26:49.817 --> 26:52.479
One minute, banished, the next you're
telling everyone they're gonna die.

26:52.570 --> 26:55.186
- That's the sum of it.
- So are we getting out of here or what?

26:55.281 --> 26:56.862
Not yet.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.028
l have to return this.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.464
Going to pick up the kids?

27:15.176 --> 27:16.165
Excuse me?

27:17.720 --> 27:19.426
Why don't you get in the car?

27:22.350 --> 27:24.011
Get in, Sayid.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.391
Why don't you have a seat.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.521
Hey, you want some eggs?

28:13.776 --> 28:17.860
I can make whatever you want...
fried, scrambled.

28:18.531 --> 28:20.897
Got that poacher?
Where's the poacher? Want poached?

28:20.992 --> 28:23.324
'Cause I could make you
some good poached eggs.

28:23.411 --> 28:26.574
- No, thank you.
- | make good eggs.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.292
No?

28:30.626 --> 28:32.241
All right.

28:45.141 --> 28:46.722
Martin Keamy.

28:48.352 --> 28:49.341
Sayid Jarrah,

28:49.437 --> 28:52.224
- but you already know that.
- That, I do. Yeah.

28:53.816 --> 28:55.317
Right.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.321
So, Sayid...

29:03.034 --> 29:04.365
How's your brother doin'?

29:08.331 --> 29:12.495
His brother got mugged right out front
of his own store. It was just terrible.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.497
Well, but at least this way, you know...

29:16.130 --> 29:18.587
...you're still around
to take care of his family.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.756
You do want to take care
of his family, don't you?

29:24.513 --> 29:25.798
Yes?

29:27.016 --> 29:28.927
You know, I can see
that you're a very...

29:30.102 --> 29:32.514
...direct guy, so l'mjust
gonna get to the point.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.772
Your brother, he borrowed
some money from me,

29:35.858 --> 29:39.942
and just like anybody who borrows money
or has a loan, he has to make payments.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.896
My brother told me
he's paid you everything he owes...

29:43.699 --> 29:47.283
- ...but that you still want more.
- Sayid, that's a lie.

29:47.370 --> 29:51.534
You brother does owe me, and somebody
is gonna pay me that money.

29:51.624 --> 29:54.115
Did you put my brother in the hospital?

29:57.171 --> 29:58.707
You think it was me?

30:00.883 --> 30:02.419
I didn't do that.

30:04.220 --> 30:08.554
You know, it's a dangerous world, Sayid.
You know that because you're from Iraq.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.517
You never know when somebody's
just gonna sneak up...

30:22.571 --> 30:24.107
Sayid...

30:24.615 --> 30:27.527
- OK, just relax now.
- Shut up.

30:30.371 --> 30:33.704
OK. Fine. Fine. OK, it's done.

30:34.250 --> 30:37.242
All right? Your brother
doesn't owe me anything.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.997
The debt's forgiven, all right?

30:42.508 --> 30:44.874
Good? OK?

30:44.969 --> 30:48.257
Just relax and... forget about it.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.508
I can't.

31:36.687 --> 31:39.474
- Who are you?
- No English.

31:55.498 --> 31:57.159
You let him talk to you.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.661
l stabbed him in the chest
like you told me to.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.118
Then I let him talk to me.

32:08.219 --> 32:10.926
That's twice you've tried to have
someone else kill me.

32:12.473 --> 32:14.805
You had the opportunity
to do it yourself.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.519
Why didn't you?

32:23.234 --> 32:27.352
l was a businessman once, in Osaka.

32:29.365 --> 32:31.447
I worked at a bank.

32:32.618 --> 32:36.076
l was good at my job, very successful.

32:37.164 --> 32:40.952
And, one Friday, l was promoted.

32:42.878 --> 32:46.871
My associates took me out to celebrate.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.502
I had too much to drink.

32:56.433 --> 33:02.303
Every Friday...
I picked my son up from baseball.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.606
He was 12.

33:10.781 --> 33:13.158
The accident was very bad.

33:16.370 --> 33:17.951
I survived.

33:20.708 --> 33:22.289
But my son...

33:27.131 --> 33:28.621
And then...

33:29.341 --> 33:31.002
...in the hospital...

33:33.262 --> 33:35.093
...a man came to me.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.555
A man I had never met.

33:39.894 --> 33:44.058
And he told me that
he could save my son's life...

33:44.565 --> 33:47.682
...but I would have to
come here, to this island...

33:49.403 --> 33:51.485
...where I would have a new job.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.900
And I could never see my boy again.

34:10.883 --> 34:12.214
Who was this man?

34:13.719 --> 34:15.675
His name was Jacob.

34:16.972 --> 34:19.088
Jacob drives a hard bargain.

34:21.143 --> 34:22.974
The man outside...

34:25.481 --> 34:28.598
I take it he offered you
a similar bargain?

34:29.401 --> 34:30.390
Yes.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.653
It is sundown.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.075
Will you choose to stay or go?

34:49.922 --> 34:51.503
I'd like to stay.

35:32.298 --> 35:33.378
Oh, my God!

35:37.386 --> 35:38.922
What have you done?!

35:49.815 --> 35:51.646
Do you realize what you just did?!

35:52.735 --> 35:54.771
He was the only thing keeping it out!

35:55.779 --> 35:57.485
Idiot!

35:57.573 --> 35:58.779
You just let it in!

36:04.997 --> 36:06.453
I know.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.678
We gotta go now.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.444
Run! Run!

36:39.865 --> 36:41.571
- Run!
- This way!

36:57.091 --> 36:59.582
- This way! This way!
- l have to go get Claire.

37:24.284 --> 37:27.242
- Where are Shephard, Reyes and Ford?
- Who the hell are you?

37:27.329 --> 37:29.911
- Answer the question.
- They're gone. I'm the only one left.

37:30.624 --> 37:32.239
Kate and I got separated.

37:32.334 --> 37:34.165
Lapidus? How did you...

37:34.253 --> 37:36.585
We'll catch-up later.
You wanna live, move your ass.

37:36.672 --> 37:39.584
- What about Jarrah? Is he here?
- He was headed to the pool room.

37:39.675 --> 37:43.008
- I'll go get him.
- Linus, wait!

37:44.138 --> 37:46.049
All right, the rest of you, with me.
Come on.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.929
Claire, come on!
Claire, we gotta go.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.011
- You gotta get out of there.
- No.

37:54.106 --> 37:56.768
- What?!
- You'll be much safer here.

38:20.883 --> 38:21.963
Sayid?

38:23.385 --> 38:25.922
Come on. I know a way out of here.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.213
There's still time.

38:31.393 --> 38:32.678
Not for me.

38:48.035 --> 38:49.115
Where's your husband?

38:49.203 --> 38:51.819
- What?!
- Your husband. He took off yesterday.

38:51.914 --> 38:54.997
- Jin was here? He's alive?
- Last I saw him, yeah.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.299
You do hear that, right?

39:10.265 --> 39:12.847
You got a plan or you gonna
keep staring at the wall?

39:16.355 --> 39:17.891
Yes, l have a plan.

39:22.778 --> 39:24.393
Everybody inside now.
