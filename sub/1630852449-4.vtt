01:08.333 --> 01:09.583

02:12.583 --> 02:13.791
Are you listening?

02:13.875 --> 02:14.708
What?

02:16.458 --> 02:17.666
What do you think?

02:27.750 --> 02:30.708
-Honestly, not that exciting.
-Boring, right?

02:33.875 --> 02:35.875
I'll ask Wilma if she has anything else.

02:38.041 --> 02:39.708
Did you call your father?

02:42.625 --> 02:45.250
Why don't you call him
if you want to so badly?

02:47.375 --> 02:48.583
Forget it.

02:49.458 --> 02:50.291
I give up.

02:52.916 --> 02:54.583
Wilma? It's me.

02:55.583 --> 02:56.625
Listen,

02:57.208 --> 02:59.416
I've looked through everything again…

03:03.166 --> 03:08.291
DOMINIK
GOOD MORNING! ARE YOU STILL AT HOME?

03:09.291 --> 03:12.208
LISI
HEY, DOMINIK. YEAH… WHY?

03:18.208 --> 03:20.833
Hey, Nessa. I was just about to call you.

03:20.916 --> 03:23.541
<i>Guess who Leonce</i>
<i>took to the film awards yesterday?</i>

03:24.041 --> 03:25.583
<i>Pippa, that little rat.</i>

03:27.166 --> 03:28.500
Just forget about her.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.000
<i>It's just a big "fuck you" to me.</i>

03:31.708 --> 03:33.666
Because she's jealous, Nessa.

03:34.458 --> 03:35.500
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:35.583 --> 03:39.208
You don't have to be some poser's plus one

03:39.791 --> 03:40.875
who thinks he's cool

03:40.958 --> 03:44.333
because he once was
in a Tarantino film for a second.

03:44.416 --> 03:46.000
<i>He really is a poser.</i>

03:46.083 --> 03:46.916
Exactly.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.541
Forget them.

03:51.583 --> 03:52.958
We'll do our own thing.

03:53.625 --> 03:54.458
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:56.166 --> 03:57.458
<i>What are you doing today?</i>

04:05.375 --> 04:07.333
-Hey.
-Dominik.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.833
Lisi.

04:14.291 --> 04:17.791
-I was just heading out.
-You wouldn't happen to need a car?

04:20.541 --> 04:22.625
-You're messing with me, right?
-No.

04:22.708 --> 04:25.125
I'll lend it to you until yours is fixed.

04:26.916 --> 04:29.458
-Thanks, but I'll manage.
-Morning!

04:30.750 --> 04:32.666
-Good morning.
-Back so soon?

04:33.541 --> 04:36.750
-Problem with the skis?
-They're good as new, Mr. Madlmeyer.

04:36.833 --> 04:39.041
-Thanks again.
-What skis?

04:39.125 --> 04:41.791
I wanted to apologize for my friend

04:41.875 --> 04:45.041
and lend your daughter a car
until hers is fixed.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.208
That's a Maserati Quattroporte.

04:48.416 --> 04:49.958
That's very kind of you.

04:50.041 --> 04:54.125
But I don't think it's a good idea
to give Lisi a race car like that.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.041
Of course.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.416
I just wanted to offer it.

04:58.041 --> 05:00.583
-Very thoughtful.
-It was just sitting around.

05:00.666 --> 05:02.125
Is that a V6 or V8?

05:02.833 --> 05:04.333
-V8.
-Right.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.833
What's its 0 to 60? Five or six seconds?

05:08.458 --> 05:09.416
Five.

05:10.958 --> 05:14.333
-I wouldn't mind taking that for a spin.
-Schorsch!

05:15.208 --> 05:18.041
-What? Why not?
-Think about your foot.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.541
Well, if it's just sitting in the garage…

05:21.458 --> 05:24.625
I'll leave the key. Just in case.

05:24.708 --> 05:28.000
I have to go.
Dominik, you probably do too?

05:29.708 --> 05:31.333
-Right.
-Want any breakfast?

05:32.000 --> 05:35.166
-Just got back from the bakery.
-I don't know.

05:35.250 --> 05:38.208
Come on.
After you bring us a machine like that…

05:39.708 --> 05:42.291
Okay. Can I carry the basket for you?

05:42.375 --> 05:43.250
Thanks.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.916
<i>Ziervogel's son is lying upstairs?</i>

06:09.000 --> 06:10.666
<i>What else could I have done?</i>

06:11.333 --> 06:13.583
<i>Helma, it's time we finally told him.</i>

06:13.666 --> 06:15.666
<i>But I don't want Hansi to know.</i>

06:16.416 --> 06:18.625
<i>He'll find out eventually anyway.</i>

06:18.708 --> 06:20.958
<i>Better he hears it from us.</i>

06:21.666 --> 06:23.750
I don't want to be reminded of it again.

06:25.958 --> 06:27.625
What will I find out anyway?

06:34.000 --> 06:37.333
-What's your problem with Kosh?
-Don't talk to your dad like that.

06:51.791 --> 06:53.125
Kosh, are you awake?

06:54.416 --> 06:56.291
Did you sleep well?

06:58.250 --> 06:59.083
Shit.

07:01.583 --> 07:02.416
Fuck!

07:12.291 --> 07:13.208
Awesome.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.833
-Soda with lemon.
-Thanks.

07:20.625 --> 07:22.750
Sometimes I forget how pretty it is here.

07:23.416 --> 07:24.250
Yeah.

07:25.375 --> 07:28.916
You have to explain something to me.
You're from Kitzbühel,

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
the number one ski resort,
and you don't ski.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.291
Are you for real?

07:34.083 --> 07:35.291
Well, I used to.

07:36.708 --> 07:37.541
It's just…

07:39.416 --> 07:41.041
Once Joseph died…

07:43.750 --> 07:46.875
Sorry, it was
really insensitive to bring that up.

07:46.958 --> 07:49.666
No. You couldn't have known.

07:53.416 --> 07:55.708
Here, this made me think of you.

07:56.541 --> 07:58.791
Because of your interest in acting.

07:59.791 --> 08:02.666
Did you buy this just for me?
How sweet is that?

08:02.750 --> 08:05.125
Well, I found it in my brother's room.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.875
I think it was for one of his girls.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.125
He even wrote a dedication.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.291
Did that director from the Burgtheater
contact you again?

08:28.500 --> 08:32.875
Yeah, Birger wants me
to make a casting video.

08:32.958 --> 08:35.291
How cool! So?

08:37.041 --> 08:39.541
The role is very edgy, pretty intense.

08:39.625 --> 08:42.500
And I don't know
if that would fit my brand.

08:47.708 --> 08:49.416
SKI SHOP
SKI RENTAL

08:52.333 --> 08:53.458
I have an idea.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.750
We'll film that video together.

08:59.041 --> 09:01.166
And I'll get back on the slopes today.

09:07.333 --> 09:08.375
Deal.

09:09.875 --> 09:10.750
SKI RENTAL

09:10.833 --> 09:12.333
You look great, Lisi.

09:12.916 --> 09:14.541
I'll pay you back. Promise.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.458
-No, you won't. You've done so much.
-Lisi.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.000
Toni.

09:19.875 --> 09:20.875
You, up here?

09:22.583 --> 09:23.916
I've been calling you.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.583
Sorry. I couldn't pick up.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.708
Eight times?

09:28.500 --> 09:29.500
This is Vanessa.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.833
Hi.

09:32.041 --> 09:34.083
So you managed to get her on skis?

09:34.166 --> 09:35.916
Yeah, looks like it.

09:37.750 --> 09:39.958
-Do I know you from somewhere?
-Antonia.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.000
Her former best friend.

09:42.083 --> 09:42.916
Toni?

09:44.791 --> 09:46.125
I'll get in touch, okay?

09:47.083 --> 09:48.291
Have fun, girls.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.833
What did you do to her?

09:56.625 --> 09:57.583
Nothing.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.000
Okay.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.666
<i>When the polar…</i>

10:10.666 --> 10:12.625
Kosh, are you there? Open up.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.333
Open up!

10:21.416 --> 10:22.250
Kosh!

10:27.291 --> 10:29.708
Thank God. Kosh, I thought that…

10:30.958 --> 10:31.791
You thought?

10:31.875 --> 10:34.666
Just vanishing like that.
Why didn't you say anything?

10:35.166 --> 10:36.875
Yesterday was just too much.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.166
I'm sorry, okay?

10:44.208 --> 10:45.208
For what?

10:52.750 --> 10:55.000
You having to drag me out of the silo,

10:55.583 --> 10:57.250
me stealing from my friends,

10:57.750 --> 10:59.458
I don't even remember the rest.

11:01.916 --> 11:03.750
I can't go on like this.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.583
I have to make a change.

11:10.125 --> 11:11.750
If you need help…

11:13.041 --> 11:14.958
What are you doing here, anyway?

11:16.166 --> 11:17.833
I was just worried.

11:17.916 --> 11:19.291
About me or something?

11:19.375 --> 11:20.916
Yes, about you, you idiot.

11:39.541 --> 11:40.375
What?

11:42.875 --> 11:45.666
See? It's not so hard
to show your feelings.

12:03.416 --> 12:05.416
Come on. I'm not that good either.

12:06.791 --> 12:08.125
Just go ahead already.

12:09.083 --> 12:09.916
Okay.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.291
Come on, Lisi!

12:20.375 --> 12:21.500
Not that good?

12:21.583 --> 12:24.000
Come on now, Lisi! Go!

13:11.041 --> 13:12.166
Awesome!

13:36.083 --> 13:36.916
Hey, Mom.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.583
-Hey, Dom.
-Hey.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.333
You know what I was thinking?

13:45.833 --> 13:46.791
Look who's here.

13:47.916 --> 13:48.750
Hello.

13:49.416 --> 13:50.708
-Conny.
-Hi, Dominik.

13:51.875 --> 13:54.750
Pretty warm outside today.
Don't you think?

13:55.916 --> 13:57.916
I'll be upstairs.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.375
Hang on, Dominik.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.541
A question for you…

14:02.125 --> 14:04.791
I spoke to your mother
about our conversation.

14:06.375 --> 14:09.208
How about you enroll with us
for the spring semester?

14:09.291 --> 14:11.375
What? Starting in March?

14:11.458 --> 14:13.958
-We actually start in February.
-I can still apply?

14:14.041 --> 14:16.500
-Aren't you full?
-I'll worry about that.

14:16.583 --> 14:19.875
I'll see to it that it's all sorted out
without any red tape.

14:23.958 --> 14:27.208
Okay. Thanks. I'll think about it.

14:27.291 --> 14:29.125
You do that. But not too long.

14:29.208 --> 14:31.833
Just two spots left
with fierce competition.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.916
<i>I faced my fear. Now it's your turn.</i>

14:44.583 --> 14:46.541
I'm no good at improvising, Lisi.

14:48.291 --> 14:49.125
Not yet.

14:50.041 --> 14:52.666
The play's called <i>Offending the Audience</i>.
It's just about--

14:52.750 --> 14:55.666
Let me guess, offending the audience?
Not exactly Shakespeare.

14:55.750 --> 14:56.625
Peter Handke.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.416
He won a Nobel Prize.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.416
Why don't they just send me a script?

15:02.500 --> 15:05.000
Because you're supposed
to show real emotion.

15:06.041 --> 15:08.208
Just reread what Birger wrote.

15:11.625 --> 15:12.666
Blah, blah, blah.

15:12.750 --> 15:16.916
"A modern interpretation to confront
the open-minded theater audience

15:17.000 --> 15:20.208
with their petty, provincial mentality."

15:20.291 --> 15:21.250
How deep.

15:21.333 --> 15:22.875
Forget about that for now.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.583
What are you doing?

15:28.333 --> 15:30.125
-Filming you.
-With your phone?

15:31.416 --> 15:32.500
Use mine, please.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.166
Okay.

15:39.458 --> 15:40.291
All right.

15:41.666 --> 15:42.500
Okay.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.875
Now keep in mind
that Birger wants to see real emotions.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.708
-I can't do it. Give me my phone.
-Just wait, Nessa.

16:05.125 --> 16:05.958
Okay, then.

16:06.958 --> 16:08.625
I guess I was wrong.

16:09.708 --> 16:11.625
It's true what people say.

16:12.750 --> 16:13.958
What do people say?

16:15.208 --> 16:16.041
Well,

16:17.125 --> 16:20.875
all you can do is look pretty
and spend your parents' money.

16:21.750 --> 16:24.333
You are a bit excessive, aren't you?

16:25.250 --> 16:26.666
I don't want to do this.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.791
And I don't want to deal
with a Munich bitch like you

16:29.875 --> 16:31.500
who thinks she owns the world.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.625
You think you're better somehow.

16:34.708 --> 16:37.000
You come here and just take what you want.

16:37.083 --> 16:41.000
-You treat us like dirt.
-But you hillbillies will accept my money?

16:43.208 --> 16:46.500
Then complain
that we're destroying your awesome home.

16:47.083 --> 16:50.500
The evil Germans. You're such hypocrites.

16:51.083 --> 16:54.833
Where does all the money come from?
Who brings it to Kitzbühel?

16:54.916 --> 16:56.333
We do.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.916
You guys are just pathetic and envious.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.166
What do you want from me?

17:02.250 --> 17:06.125
Is it my fault you've never left
your shitty backwoods town?

17:06.708 --> 17:08.375
I just feel sorry for you.

17:09.250 --> 17:10.125
You know what?

17:11.291 --> 17:16.000
I wish an avalanche would come
bury this whole fucking village!

17:19.833 --> 17:22.125
Vanessa, it turned out so good!

17:23.125 --> 17:24.333
You really think so?

17:29.666 --> 17:30.500
Hey.

17:32.916 --> 17:34.666
I think you think too much.

17:36.458 --> 17:37.666
Just send it.

17:40.708 --> 17:42.000
No, I…

17:42.083 --> 17:44.041
I have to digest it first.

17:45.208 --> 17:46.166
Yeah, of course.

18:00.375 --> 18:01.208
What's wrong?

18:04.125 --> 18:05.208
It doesn't matter.

18:06.666 --> 18:08.000
It happened long ago.

18:09.375 --> 18:10.625
What happened long ago?

18:12.541 --> 18:14.750
I think I just need some alone time.

18:31.875 --> 18:34.875
<i>Hi, it's Hans.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

18:34.958 --> 18:36.916
Vanessa really delivered.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.416
You should have seen it.
If it goes online…

18:43.958 --> 18:44.791
I mean,

18:45.333 --> 18:48.125
obviously, it will go online. Of course.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.958
Call me back, okay?

18:59.250 --> 19:00.208
Are you ready?

19:00.916 --> 19:01.750
Yeah.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.166
No turning back.

19:04.375 --> 19:05.833
Let's dump this shit.

19:05.916 --> 19:06.791
On three.

19:07.791 --> 19:09.666
One, two…

19:09.750 --> 19:13.041
<i>Sayonara</i>, baby!

19:15.541 --> 19:16.916
Never again.

19:22.541 --> 19:23.500
Never again.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.541
<i>I wish an avalanche would come</i>
<i>bury this whole fucking vi--</i>

20:08.500 --> 20:12.416
RECEIVING EMAILS
NO NEW EMAILS

20:30.208 --> 20:35.000
LISI MOBILE
5 UNREAD MESSAGES

20:52.125 --> 20:54.125
Thanks for giving me a ride home.

20:54.208 --> 20:58.458
Well, after that silo stunt last night,
it's the least I can do.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.041
Mr. Gassner.

21:02.500 --> 21:03.791
Thank you, Mr. Ziervogel.

21:07.541 --> 21:11.083
-Jeez! What was that?
-Just some avalanche blasting.

21:11.916 --> 21:14.458
I thought it was your mom with a rifle.

21:16.625 --> 21:18.625
Are you sure this is a good idea?

21:18.708 --> 21:20.875
Me going in, I mean.

21:23.250 --> 21:25.500
I don't want to cause any more drama.

21:27.875 --> 21:28.708
You're not.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.208
Morning, sweetie.

21:44.250 --> 21:45.083
Morning.

21:45.750 --> 21:47.083
Look who's here.

21:50.833 --> 21:51.666
Mom!

21:59.208 --> 22:01.250
I thought you'd been up already.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.000
I didn't sleep too well.

22:04.416 --> 22:07.500
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.958
If it's about the kiss…
You have a girlfriend.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.791
I know. But it's not about the kiss.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.500
What, then?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.125
Your dress!

22:31.208 --> 22:34.916
It'll have its big debut tomorrow.
At my mom's fashion show.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.250
Fashion show?

22:41.791 --> 22:45.250
This fashion show will boost
your career more than any college.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.791
You were in my room?

22:47.375 --> 22:49.541
Your dress will be the highlight.
Regine agrees.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.791
Plus, you're from Kitzbühel
and a local hero!

22:51.875 --> 22:54.458
Local… Have you all lost your minds?

22:55.708 --> 22:58.041
Okay. Just relax.

22:58.125 --> 23:00.208
Don't tell me when to relax.

23:06.416 --> 23:08.000
Okay, I'm sorry.

23:08.750 --> 23:11.583
What gives you the right
to meddle in my life?

23:12.208 --> 23:14.541
First, you secretly come
to "get your skis waxed."

23:14.625 --> 23:15.625
It wasn't a secret.

23:15.708 --> 23:18.166
Then you park a Maserati out front
like a mob boss.

23:18.250 --> 23:22.000
And now you want me in your mother's show.
What do you want from me, Dominik?

23:22.083 --> 23:23.208
To help you.

23:24.458 --> 23:25.291
To help me?

23:28.750 --> 23:32.583
Before trying to help me,
maybe start with your own life first.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.625
Okay, then.

23:45.833 --> 23:46.791
You know what?

23:47.416 --> 23:51.166
When I first saw your dress,
I was like, "Wow! You're really talented."

23:51.250 --> 23:53.541
I thought you'd be excited
for the opportunity.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.291
But if you're too proud…

24:11.416 --> 24:13.375
You didn't milk the cows this morning.

24:16.208 --> 24:17.375
Mom, this is Kosh.

24:18.708 --> 24:19.625
I already know.

24:23.375 --> 24:25.166
Kosh might be here more often.

24:26.291 --> 24:27.833
Tell him he's not welcome here.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.458
No worries, I'll just go.

24:31.541 --> 24:32.416
No, wait.

24:33.916 --> 24:36.541
Kosh has ears and a mouth.
Tell him yourself.

24:36.625 --> 24:39.333
He's already done enough damage.
He and his father.

24:42.208 --> 24:44.125
How is my father involved?

24:45.541 --> 24:48.791
Tell the truth right now,
or I'll leave and never come back.

24:48.875 --> 24:52.625
He toyed with me
in every possible way to get our slope.

24:53.208 --> 24:55.125
I thought it wasn't profitable anymore?

24:55.625 --> 24:57.875
He wanted to build his hotel,
that Ziervogel.

24:58.458 --> 24:59.916
He said he loved me.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.541
And I was stupid enough to believe him.

25:02.625 --> 25:03.666
My father?

25:04.333 --> 25:05.375
Yes, your father.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.500
He lied and screwed me over.

25:08.583 --> 25:10.333
But Kosh isn't his father.

25:11.041 --> 25:14.000
They're all the same.
They only care about money.

25:14.083 --> 25:15.875
Nothing is sacred to them!

25:21.666 --> 25:22.583
Bye.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.500
Sorry about how she treated you.

25:52.416 --> 25:53.375
No, I'm sorry.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.791
My father outdid himself with that one.

26:11.625 --> 26:13.250
Papa, I need to tell you something.

26:15.083 --> 26:16.250
It's now been

26:17.750 --> 26:21.125
an entire year since Joseph passed.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.375
And I feel like life needs to go on now.

26:28.791 --> 26:31.958
What would you say
if I applied to London again?

26:37.375 --> 26:39.625
No one's demanding you stay here forever.

26:40.500 --> 26:43.416
The last thing we want
is to stand in your way

26:43.916 --> 26:45.000
or to hold you back.

26:46.166 --> 26:48.125
-Yeah?
-Of course.

26:49.333 --> 26:52.250
It may not look like it, but I'm tough.

26:52.875 --> 26:54.208
Your mom even more so.

27:02.041 --> 27:03.416
Of course you should go.

27:43.041 --> 27:45.708
So? What do you think?

27:47.750 --> 27:48.583
Be honest.

27:51.125 --> 27:52.708
It's great.

27:52.791 --> 27:53.666
Great?

27:54.958 --> 27:57.875
Didn't the sleeves turn out a bit big?

28:00.666 --> 28:02.583
That's exactly the point!

28:02.666 --> 28:03.500
I see.

28:05.125 --> 28:05.958
What point?

28:07.000 --> 28:11.083
To fill out the dress in your mind
even if you could never do it physically.

28:11.166 --> 28:13.333
I don't know about this stuff, Lisi.

28:13.416 --> 28:16.458
It symbolizes protection, strength,

28:17.416 --> 28:18.500
self-confidence.

28:18.583 --> 28:20.875
I see. Okay, I get it.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.875
You're right. It's total shit!

28:24.958 --> 28:28.083
No, I'm not saying that at all.
I really think it's great.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.458
-It has to be sent out tomorrow!
-But?

28:30.541 --> 28:34.041
-I can't send it like this!
-Of course, you can!

28:34.125 --> 28:35.041
You have to.

28:36.791 --> 28:38.500
But something is missing, Jo.

28:43.583 --> 28:46.375
If you never set off
from the top of the mountain,

28:46.458 --> 28:48.416
you'll never reach the finish line.

28:49.541 --> 28:50.833
Deep as always.

29:06.750 --> 29:07.875
HI CONNY,

29:07.958 --> 29:11.708
I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR MSAD OFFER.

29:11.791 --> 29:14.125
THANKS, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT!

29:30.416 --> 29:32.875
DEAR BIRGER,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST.

29:32.958 --> 29:36.125
ATTACHED PLEASED FIND
THE ONLINE CASTING VIDEO.

29:40.416 --> 29:46.791
I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOU UP
ON YOUR MSAD OFFER. THANKS!

30:07.500 --> 30:09.833
SENDING EMAIL…

30:46.958 --> 30:47.791
Are you okay?

30:52.416 --> 30:53.916
I don't feel so good.

30:55.791 --> 30:56.958
Ate too much tuna.

30:59.708 --> 31:01.333
I guess I'd better go then.

31:01.833 --> 31:02.708
Fine.

31:05.541 --> 31:07.041
Can we talk for a minute?

31:08.875 --> 31:10.000
What is it?

31:15.708 --> 31:17.166
Today was pretty rough.

31:17.958 --> 31:21.125
-Sorry for dragging you into it.
-It's okay.

31:22.416 --> 31:24.833
I'm also sorry for being so cold to you.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.541
I know you only meant well.

31:28.166 --> 31:29.000
No worries.

31:42.625 --> 31:44.375
I used to have someone I really liked.

31:46.375 --> 31:49.375
I waited forever
for the right moment to tell him.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.500
Suddenly, it was too late.

31:54.791 --> 31:56.000
Now he's gone.

32:03.458 --> 32:05.000
When you were in the silo,

32:06.583 --> 32:11.125
I realized, "Shit,
that guy in there, I really like him."

32:20.541 --> 32:21.916
I think I love you.

32:24.625 --> 32:25.458
Me?

32:36.125 --> 32:38.666
What's wrong with you. Are you nuts?

32:43.583 --> 32:45.583
What, do you want to punch me now?

32:45.666 --> 32:46.833
Come on. Do it.

32:46.916 --> 32:48.708
Here. Hit me.

32:48.791 --> 32:50.208
Or are you going to cry?

32:50.291 --> 32:52.500
You're the most fucked up person
I've ever met.

32:52.583 --> 32:54.208
See? Your mom was right!

32:54.791 --> 32:55.750
Fuck you!

33:15.333 --> 33:17.041
What else shall I eat?

33:17.750 --> 33:20.083
-I thought you were full?
-A little bit.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.708
The windows here.

33:25.458 --> 33:27.500
Okay, and now the wheels.

33:28.958 --> 33:30.083
Check it out.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.041
Mommy, look.

33:34.750 --> 33:35.583
Wow!

33:36.125 --> 33:38.833
I knew you were good at drawing,
but this good?

33:38.916 --> 33:42.291
-You didn't get that from Kingsley.
-What? Excuse me?

33:42.375 --> 33:46.000
Dr. Reid, you draw people
with four fingers and hydrocephalus.

33:49.333 --> 33:52.083
Kingsley said
you want to be a car designer?

33:52.166 --> 33:54.375
-Yes.
-And? How's that going?

33:55.041 --> 33:57.708
I'm starting in Munich next semester.

33:59.500 --> 34:00.750
At MSAD.

34:01.291 --> 34:02.750
MSAD?

34:05.791 --> 34:06.666
Wow.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.625
That sounds amazing. Right?

34:12.375 --> 34:15.208
It's a good school. Private.

34:16.666 --> 34:20.041
Isn't that Breidenbacher
the president now?

34:21.000 --> 34:22.708
Yeah, that's right.

34:24.666 --> 34:27.750
I'm guessing
the application process was pretty simple.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.541
Darling. Even if that's the case,

34:33.541 --> 34:35.166
there's more to it.

34:35.250 --> 34:37.208
He has to do
the real hard work by himself.

34:41.250 --> 34:45.000
You said you worked your way up
for your kids to have it better than you.

34:46.625 --> 34:48.166
And now they do.

34:48.791 --> 34:50.166
And it bothers you.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.083
What do you want me to do?

35:04.250 --> 35:05.500
TEMPORARILY CLOSED

35:56.375 --> 35:57.208
Lisi?

36:01.041 --> 36:01.875
Hey.

36:02.708 --> 36:04.666
I revised it again. It's…

36:05.166 --> 36:08.500
It's still not perfect,
but you were totally right.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.000
It's earned its premiere.

36:11.875 --> 36:15.208
I agree. But do you want to come in first?

36:17.166 --> 36:18.000
Okay.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.541
I may have been too harsh earlier.

36:38.666 --> 36:40.625
I know you only mean well.

36:41.958 --> 36:43.666
I overstepped my bounds.

36:44.833 --> 36:47.375
I should have asked you first.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.958
I don't know what I'm thinking sometimes.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.625
You shouldn't have.

36:57.250 --> 37:01.000
Since Joseph passed,
I've been too scared to touch it again.

37:02.583 --> 37:05.083
For a year,
I just couldn't look at the thing.

37:09.541 --> 37:10.375
Well,

37:11.375 --> 37:12.250
until now.

37:17.708 --> 37:18.541
Thank you.

38:44.083 --> 38:45.041
Hey, Lisi.

38:46.416 --> 38:47.666
I did it.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.583
I sent the video off.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.708
I wanted to say,
I've only known you for a few days,

38:53.791 --> 38:57.166
but you've become
a really good friend in this short time.

38:57.250 --> 38:58.750
Thank you.

38:58.833 --> 39:00.500
We need to celebrate, okay?

39:01.125 --> 39:02.041
See you soon.

39:39.416 --> 39:45.208
