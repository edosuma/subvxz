WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:01.436
<i>Previously on "The Ark"...</i>

00:01.436 --> 00:03.220
The U-238 and the Aliciaminium,

00:03.220 --> 00:04.700
they'’re on another ship.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.007
So that means whatever hit us
also hit Ark 3.

00:09.531 --> 00:10.749
So they died from the breach.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.625
- I need answers.
- Twelve of us were suited up

00:16.625 --> 00:18.453
for a maintenance run
when the ship decompressed.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.803
My husband.
Where is our daughter?

00:20.803 --> 00:24.024
The day global
food rationing began,
she took a stray bullet.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.418
Projectile weapons
have no place in space.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.942
The hull on that
attacking ship said Ark 15?

00:29.942 --> 00:31.379
That'’s who attacked us?

00:31.379 --> 00:33.642
How did Ark 3 get so far
into space ahead of us?

00:33.642 --> 00:35.339
We traveled faster
than light speed.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.472
- Not possible.
- Evelyn Maddox figured it out.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.256
The trillionaire who took
over Trust Industries?

00:39.256 --> 00:42.433
I need to see
the Maddox retrofit.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.569
It'’s Ark 3's self-destruct.
It wants an abort code.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.049
We'’re looking through
Captain Bishop'’s files.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.485
I have a code.
Are you ready?

00:50.485 --> 00:54.489
12-22-06-06.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.534
- It worked.
- Thank you, Mr. Trust.

00:56.534 --> 00:57.492
Where the hell am I?

01:00.103 --> 01:03.150
<i>Lane, where are you?
Report to the bridge.</i>

01:03.150 --> 01:05.587
I said, where the hell am I?

01:05.587 --> 01:08.851
Mr. Trust,
I'’m Lieutenant Lane
and you'’re in Ark 1.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.770
Mr. Trust, you have
to pressurize your suit.

01:14.770 --> 01:17.642
- Your body isn'’t stable.
- I'’m not supposed to be here.

01:17.642 --> 01:20.602
You just woke up from cryo.
Maybe you should sit
while I explain.

01:26.434 --> 01:30.046
- Helena? What'’s going on?
- I was protecting you.

01:30.046 --> 01:32.048
He might'’ve been here
to kill you.

01:32.048 --> 01:36.574
No. I mean, I want
to know why exactly
we'’re on this damn ship.

02:02.861 --> 02:04.863
I know they say in the wake
of near death experiences

02:04.863 --> 02:07.866
people do unexpected things.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.913
I'’ve got say,
I didn'’t expect this.

02:10.913 --> 02:15.222
This was blowing off steam,

02:15.222 --> 02:17.224
but it didn'’t mean anything.

02:17.224 --> 02:20.096
- It was just sex.
- Oh, yeah, just-- just sex.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.706
- A one-time thing.
- Yeah, one time.

02:21.706 --> 02:24.666
- I'’m serious.
- Oh, me, too.

02:24.666 --> 02:28.496
Yeah, me too.
I mean, it'’s refreshing, really.

02:28.496 --> 02:31.238
Just two people
on the same page.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.720
It was fun though,
wasn'’t it?

02:39.289 --> 02:41.857
Garnet on PA:
<i>All bridge crew,
please report.</i>

02:47.297 --> 02:49.691
Have you seen Lane?
He still hasn'’t checked in

02:49.691 --> 02:51.171
since he came through
with those codes.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.476
Uh, no. No, no.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.478
I thought he was here
with you.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.524
He was until he wasn'’t.

02:56.524 --> 03:00.049
They conducted final sweeps
of Ark 3. It was clear.

03:00.049 --> 03:02.269
I haven'’t seen Lieutenant Lane
since we got back.

03:02.269 --> 03:05.968
Been a bit busy
with the Maddox retrofit.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.578
We'’ll just have to
get started without him.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.406
You know, he'’s probably
sleeping off his heroics.

03:09.406 --> 03:12.714
Narrowly escaping death,
it really does
drive a person into bed.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.543
Alicia, pull up Ark 3'’s
video log footage.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.719
This video confirms
what we theorized.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.938
Our ark and Ark 4 were hit
by the same substance.

03:19.938 --> 03:23.507
- A corrosive chemical that--
- You mean the Aliciaminium.

03:23.507 --> 03:26.162
We'’re not calling it that.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.077
What we know now
that we didn'’t before

03:28.077 --> 03:31.994
is that the chemical
came from a weapon
mounted on Ark 15.

03:31.994 --> 03:35.171
What is Ark 15 doing out here?
They weren'’t supposed
to launch for years.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.955
From what Kelly told us,
it sounds like

03:36.955 --> 03:39.915
the program accelerated
as things got worse on Earth.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.221
Zoom in on the ship.

03:42.570 --> 03:45.747
More. Once more.

03:45.747 --> 03:49.141
There. See what I see?

03:49.141 --> 03:50.795
Yeah, looks like
this Maddox lady

03:50.795 --> 03:53.233
had a bit of an ego trip
when she took over from Trust.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.758
But why would one ark
attack the others?

03:56.758 --> 03:59.195
Especially when there'’s
so few of us left.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.414
I'’ll have a look
through Ark 3'’s archives,

04:00.414 --> 04:03.199
see if there are
any answers in there.

04:03.199 --> 04:06.158
And I'’ll get to work
attaching the Maddox retrofit
to our engines.

04:06.158 --> 04:08.944
Good. Do it.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.338
Felix, look for Lane.

04:11.338 --> 04:13.035
It'’s not like him
to miss a meeting.

04:31.358 --> 04:35.231
Alicia! You met Kelly?

04:35.231 --> 04:37.581
- She'’s the Ark 3 survivor.
- We'’ve met.

04:37.581 --> 04:40.802
Um, Garnet wants me to look
through Ark 3'’s archives.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.413
Want to help?
She wants to see
if we can find a reason

04:43.413 --> 04:45.459
why Ark 15 would'’ve been
attacking the other arks.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.764
How do you know it was Ark 15?

04:46.764 --> 04:48.766
Angus and I recovered
the footage.

04:48.766 --> 04:51.943
- You did?
- Yeah, well,
really it was Alicia.

04:51.943 --> 04:54.816
She built a program
on the fly to reconstruct
the timeline of events.

04:54.816 --> 04:57.427
It was just a simple
computer code.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.429
So you two really are
the resident geniuses.

04:59.429 --> 05:02.258
We also built the detector
that found your ship

05:02.258 --> 05:04.782
using the residue left behind
from the Ark 15 weapon.

05:04.782 --> 05:10.048
So you found me.
You'’re the reason I was rescued.

05:10.048 --> 05:13.617
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kind of.

05:13.617 --> 05:17.142
Hey, maybe you can help us
figure out what happened.

05:17.142 --> 05:20.189
- What do you mean?
- You know, go through
the archives with us.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.625
You were on Earth
longer than we were.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.366
Whatever you know about
what it was like

05:23.366 --> 05:25.368
when Maddox took over
the Ark program
might give us clues

05:25.368 --> 05:27.414
as to why your ship
was attacked.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.286
I'’m sorry, I just-- I can't.

05:30.286 --> 05:34.072
But you know more than anyone
else about what happened.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.336
I'’m just not ready to dig
through those memories yet.

05:38.903 --> 05:44.082
Anyway, I heard that there'’s
going to be a remembrance
before we depart Ark 3?

05:44.082 --> 05:47.172
I kind of want to go,
but I don'’t want to go alone.

05:47.172 --> 05:52.264
I'’ll go with you. Oh, yeah.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.919
So will Alicia, right?

05:54.919 --> 05:59.271
Um, I really should get to work
on the archives for Garnet.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.708
It seemed important.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.846
Okay. See you later then?

06:12.067 --> 06:14.156
Yeah. See you later.

06:16.463 --> 06:19.335
So let'’s make sure
that the lives

06:19.335 --> 06:22.425
that were lost on Ark 3
are remembered

06:22.425 --> 06:25.733
and that we honor them
by fulfilling our mission,

06:25.733 --> 06:29.737
and by creating a world that
will flourish in their memory.

06:29.737 --> 06:33.131
- I'’m really sorry.
- What do you have
to be sorry for?

06:33.131 --> 06:36.657
About your friends.
It must be really hard
to leave it all behind.

06:36.657 --> 06:39.529
Well, hopefully
there are better things ahead
than what we left behind.

06:41.488 --> 06:45.143
I like that.
Better things ahead.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.581
Those born with
an exceptional drive
to make this universe...

06:47.581 --> 06:49.409
Come on. Show me more
about how you grow the food.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.801
...a better place
for the rest of us.

06:50.801 --> 06:53.761
No sign of Lane.

06:53.761 --> 06:56.720
Lieutenant Lane,
please check in with
council immediately.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.549
Friends whose
courageous spirits
led them all...

06:59.549 --> 07:00.985
- Something'’s not right.
- ...on a journey of science.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.770
Start a search party.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.438
Would you stand still
for a minute?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.962
I bet Evelyn did this.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.355
Her way of finishing us off
after taking over my company.

07:23.355 --> 07:27.403
Our company.
And I thought you were done
with conspiracy theories.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.187
Don'’t you want to know
how we ended up here?

07:29.187 --> 07:31.320
I want you to stop
walking in circles.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.757
- You'’re making me dizzy.
- Walking is good
for the circulation.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.803
We need to get our muscles
back up to speed.

07:35.803 --> 07:39.023
- You should do the same.
- You'’re driving yourself crazy.

07:41.896 --> 07:45.987
The last thing I remember,
we were working late at HQ.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.728
And then we left together.

07:47.728 --> 07:49.425
<i>And then there'’s nothing.</i>

07:49.425 --> 07:51.775
You can take my company,
but you can'’t lock us out!

07:51.775 --> 07:56.780
I own this building
and everything in it.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.826
Yes, sweetheart.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.005
They need me.

08:04.005 --> 08:06.094
Humanity needs me.

08:06.094 --> 08:09.793
Of course they do,
and one day they'’ll understand.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.934
And one day
you'’ll understand this.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.459
Just remember, I love you.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.507
You did this.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.640
I did what I had to.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.474
Lane was last seen
on the bridge.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.128
Do you think his disappearance
has something to do

08:40.128 --> 08:41.999
with the code that he got
to stop the self-destruct?

08:41.999 --> 08:43.827
- I mean, we don'’t know
where we got it from.
- Don'’t worry.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.394
We will find him.
It'’s a spaceship.

08:45.394 --> 08:48.049
There'’s only so many places
he could'’ve gone.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.747
Okay, spread out.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.199
Lane?

09:29.612 --> 09:32.876
- Do you think he'’s hurt?
- At this point, I don'’t
know what to think.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.009
He'’s not one to go off
the grid like this.

09:35.009 --> 09:38.099
No, I mean, he'’s usually all up
in everyone'’s business about,

09:38.099 --> 09:41.668
- well, everything.
- I'’ve got one more idea.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.713
Alicia, please?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.454
Could you help me look through
the communications logs?

09:45.454 --> 09:47.325
Sure.
What are we looking for?

09:47.325 --> 09:49.589
The record of Lane'’s
transmission to Ark 3.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.416
What, you mean the call
he made with the code

09:51.416 --> 09:53.114
that shut down
the self-destruct?

09:53.114 --> 09:54.898
Our logs record
every communication

09:54.898 --> 09:57.553
and where the call originated
within the ark.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.729
So if we just narrow down
the time frame

09:59.729 --> 10:01.513
and search the outgoing
communications, then...

10:01.513 --> 10:04.125
Voilà! That'’s it.

10:04.125 --> 10:07.302
- He made the call from--
- Sector OT?

10:07.302 --> 10:09.652
That does not make sense.

10:09.652 --> 10:12.699
Our sectors
are numbered as well.
Not just lettered.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.919
Okay. So how does
Lane make a call

10:15.919 --> 10:18.269
from a sector of the ship
that doesn'’t exist?

10:22.534 --> 10:24.580
I'’m conducting this examination

10:24.580 --> 10:27.539
to determine exact
cause of death for the record.

10:27.539 --> 10:32.066
The body is that of
a 26-year-old man brought in

10:32.066 --> 10:34.198
with severe internal bleeding.

10:54.175 --> 11:00.181
Post-mortem exam displays
internal organ failure

11:00.181 --> 11:03.967
consistent with blood loss
during surgery.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.056
<i>Stitches did not take.</i>

11:06.056 --> 11:11.192
Appears that inability
of significant wounds to clot

11:11.192 --> 11:14.630
<i>resulted in heart failure.</i>

11:17.198 --> 11:18.416
<i>Dr. Kabir?</i>

11:20.984 --> 11:23.204
Dr. Kabir, you all right?

11:23.204 --> 11:25.423
I'’m here for the body,
for the NOR.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.817
That'’s the Natural
Organic Reduction system

11:27.817 --> 11:30.820
we use to break down organic
material for our fertilizer.

11:34.998 --> 11:39.916
Oh, no. I'’m-- oh, I'm sorry.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.396
Oh, my-- I wanted to show you

11:41.396 --> 11:42.614
how we make the fertilizer
for gardening.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.007
I forgot that meant seeing--

11:44.007 --> 11:45.835
He'’s your friend.
I'’m so sorry.

11:45.835 --> 11:49.447
- It'’s okay, Angus.
- You can'’t take him.

11:49.447 --> 11:52.799
I'’m in the middle
of my post-mortem exam.

11:52.799 --> 11:55.540
Is that really necessary?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.847
Does it matter
how it happened?

11:59.240 --> 12:02.460
Of course it matters.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.376
Every single person matters.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.596
- Get out.
- But, doc--

12:07.596 --> 12:08.945
Get out now.

12:25.092 --> 12:28.878
Don'’t you understand?
When you lost your job,
you lost your purpose,

12:28.878 --> 12:30.924
- and I was losing you.
- So you kidnapped me.

12:30.924 --> 12:34.231
You left your reputation,
our reputation, in shambles.

12:34.231 --> 12:37.757
- People wanted us dead.
- That doesn'’t give you
the right to do this.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.541
And on top of everything else,

12:39.541 --> 12:42.718
you were messing around
with any woman with a pulse.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.981
Oh, yeah, I knew.

12:44.981 --> 12:48.289
And I was still willing
to fight for us.

12:48.289 --> 12:51.509
This way,
you still get to Proxima B,

12:51.509 --> 12:53.555
and you will still be
installed as their leader.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.734
I am sorry about earlier.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.736
I thought that you were
attacking my husband.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.738
I'’m Helena Trust.
I'’m William's wife.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.003
Lieutenant Spencer Lane.

13:07.003 --> 13:10.267
You hear that?
You hit a lieutenant.

13:10.267 --> 13:14.141
- I didn'’t recognize him.
He wasn'’t one of ours.
- One of yours?

13:14.141 --> 13:19.015
We must be approaching
Proxima B shortly
since we were woken from cryo?

13:19.015 --> 13:21.583
There was an accident.
We woke up early.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.280
At our current pace,
we'’re still years away.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.196
- Years?
- Maybe I could help.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.545
If you bring us
up to the bridge--

13:27.545 --> 13:28.633
It was made very clear to me

13:28.633 --> 13:29.896
that it'’s my job
to protect you,

13:29.896 --> 13:32.202
and that means
keeping your secret.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.769
I mean, there are people
who want you dead.

13:35.902 --> 13:39.644
People still care about that?
Here?

13:39.644 --> 13:42.560
The atmospheric de-carbonization
initiative failed.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.780
So I pivoted.
I built the damn ship.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.913
I created an escape plan.
I saved the human race!

13:46.913 --> 13:51.526
Would you be so kind
as to fetch our confidants
from the leadership team,

13:51.526 --> 13:54.834
Captain Lester or Lieutenant
Commander Susan Ingram?

13:54.834 --> 13:58.925
There'’s an ensign
who was supposed to be here
when we awake.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.535
- Ensign Trent.
- Yes.

14:02.754 --> 14:03.973
What is it?

14:06.584 --> 14:10.414
I'’m so sorry,
but they'’re all dead.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.113
All of the leadership team
died in the accident
that woke us up,

14:13.113 --> 14:16.420
and Trent died
saving this ship.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.946
The only person left alive
you can be sure
you can trust is me.

14:33.133 --> 14:38.007
Feels like we'’ve been
doing circles in this
damn ship all day.

14:38.007 --> 14:41.968
Last time I was down here
was when Trent
tried to run away.

14:41.968 --> 14:45.841
Run where?
It'’s a spaceship.

14:45.841 --> 14:48.017
Was he gonna jump out
an airlock or something?

14:52.979 --> 14:54.458
Wait a minute.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.071
We have been going in circles.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.861
A bunch of overlapping
rectangles, actually.

15:05.861 --> 15:09.430
Yes, but enclosing
what exactly?

15:09.430 --> 15:12.085
What'’s in the middle?

15:15.871 --> 15:17.655
I'’m really happy
you asked me to help.

15:17.655 --> 15:19.483
I was hoping to get
a closer look at the retrofit.

15:19.483 --> 15:21.224
It'’s kind of beautiful,
don'’t you think?

15:21.224 --> 15:24.532
No, not really.

15:24.532 --> 15:27.752
Did you know
that throughout history,
inventions for space travel

15:27.752 --> 15:30.712
have influenced the course
of technological advances
on Earth?

15:30.712 --> 15:33.106
Like, my glasses
are scratch-resistant

15:33.106 --> 15:37.632
because of research done
by NASA in the 1980s.

15:37.632 --> 15:42.463
They were trying to enhance
spacecraft water purification,
but how cool is that?

15:42.463 --> 15:46.075
How does that have
anything to do with
what we'’re doing right now?

15:46.075 --> 15:49.687
Oh, well,
I was reading the archives,

15:49.687 --> 15:53.909
and amidst
the deterioration of Earth
there were glimmers of hope.

15:53.909 --> 15:56.477
Maddox'’s research
into faster than light tech

15:56.477 --> 15:59.045
led to unexpected advances
in other areas,

15:59.045 --> 16:01.003
like disease control,
for example.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.701
That'’s why I think
it'’s so beautiful,

16:03.701 --> 16:05.486
'’cause it represents
so much more.

16:05.486 --> 16:08.706
- What kind of disease control?
- Oh, I'’m not sure.

16:08.706 --> 16:11.492
I'’ve only read
the first 5% of the files.

16:11.492 --> 16:13.450
Angus was too busy to help me.

16:13.450 --> 16:17.150
You know, hanging out with
his new best friend Kelly.

16:17.150 --> 16:22.807
Have you ever not noticed
someone for awhile,

16:22.807 --> 16:28.813
and then suddenly
you do notice them
as more than a friend,

16:28.813 --> 16:30.598
but you realize
you might'’ve missed out

16:30.598 --> 16:32.556
on not noticing them
sooner and--

16:32.556 --> 16:36.212
Never mind. I'’m rambling.

16:36.212 --> 16:41.304
Alicia,
there'’s a person for everyone.

16:41.304 --> 16:45.352
And if you'’ve found yours,
make sure you hold on tight.

16:45.352 --> 16:48.659
We don'’t always get
as much time as we'’d like.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.313
We need your help.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.967
Can you pull up
the ark blueprints?

16:51.967 --> 16:54.100
We'’re trying to trace
Lane'’s call from Sector OT.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.145
- There'’s no Sector OT.
- I know.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.933
Yes. What'’s in the middle
of these corridors here?

17:01.933 --> 17:06.155
Weird. Everything between those
corridors has redundant systems.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.940
- What does it mean?
- Like it was copied
and pasted from over here.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.986
What do you think
is actually there?

17:10.986 --> 17:13.728
I don'’t know,
but we'’re going to find out.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.164
Eva, come with us.

17:21.823 --> 17:25.044
Oh, good.
I'’m glad you're here.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.829
Uh, whoa.
Why are you taking
your robe off?

17:27.829 --> 17:30.005
See this mole?
I want you to remove it.

17:30.005 --> 17:33.356
My skin is perfect except
for this one damn mole.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.576
Is this how you start
all your sessions?

17:35.576 --> 17:38.057
- Talking about yourself?
- Oh, you'’re here for session?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.755
Yeah, why else would I be here?

17:44.802 --> 17:47.588
- The doctor is present.
- Never mind.
This was a bad idea.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.068
You knocked on my door.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.636
The floor is yours.

18:02.342 --> 18:06.607
I think I killed that man
from the other ark.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.436
- You think you did?
- Well, it'’s hard
to know for sure.

18:09.436 --> 18:13.570
But, I mean,
my hands were shaking
during surgery and...

18:15.877 --> 18:20.925
I'’ve been taking pills.
It became a bad habit.

18:20.925 --> 18:22.797
I had a feeling.

18:22.797 --> 18:25.626
I kind of know it
when I see it.

18:25.626 --> 18:29.195
About ten years ago,
I got caught in a UV storm.

18:29.195 --> 18:30.848
They put me on a cocktail
of medications.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.937
Let'’s just say
I got a little too dependent.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.375
What did you do?

18:35.375 --> 18:36.637
Well, I was rich and famous.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.769
I did what rich
and famous people do.

18:38.769 --> 18:42.164
I went to the most exclusive
and most expensive
rehab center available to me.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.340
I mean, that sounds lovely,
but seeing as we'’re in
the middle of space...

18:44.340 --> 18:48.649
Welcome to the poshest
rehab center on Ark 1.

18:48.649 --> 18:51.652
The first thing we do
when you check in
with our concierge

18:51.652 --> 18:53.088
is to take away your pills.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.440
Strickland locked up
the initial stash

18:57.440 --> 18:59.050
when he realized
what I was doing,

18:59.050 --> 19:01.052
but then we got more
from Ark 3.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.793
Have you taken any?

19:02.793 --> 19:06.232
No, but, I mean,
it'’s been damn tempting.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.625
I'’m scared that
I can'’t do my job
without them.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.541
Okay, here'’s what
we'’re going to do.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.195
You'’re gonna give me the key.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.892
From now on,
you'’re gonna go through me

19:14.892 --> 19:17.112
to distribute your medication.

19:17.112 --> 19:21.725
And in the meantime,
we'’re gonna talk. A lot.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.861
Now, back to
the important question.

19:26.861 --> 19:27.949
You'’ll remove the mole for me?

19:30.125 --> 19:32.997
It'’s not a mole.
It'’s a freckle.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.477
Wait, well,
what'’s the difference?

19:42.268 --> 19:45.488
This is the dead end
Trent ran to.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.970
I caught him
right around here.

19:50.711 --> 19:53.017
Do you think
he knew something?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.678
Move, move, move!

20:09.164 --> 20:13.212
Where were you running to?
We'’re in space.

20:38.541 --> 20:39.803
Interesting.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.635
So what am I supposed to do?

20:45.635 --> 20:47.376
Just wait down here
indefinitely?

20:47.376 --> 20:49.248
We'’ll come up with a plan
to integrate you into the ship.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.381
We just need to be smart
about it.

20:52.381 --> 20:55.645
And what do I do
in the meantime?
Twiddle my thumbs?

20:55.645 --> 20:58.735
Well, you could tell me
more about this.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.490
- Is it what I think it is?
- How is this here?

21:14.490 --> 21:16.187
This was due to be
on the later ark

21:16.187 --> 21:17.928
that we were scheduled
to depart on.

21:17.928 --> 21:21.149
You really think
I didn'’t work out every
detail of this plan?

21:21.149 --> 21:23.456
I knew how important
that library was to you.

21:23.456 --> 21:26.415
And that is why I love you.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.764
I know.

21:29.418 --> 21:34.423
You piss me the hell off,
but I love you.

21:46.870 --> 21:48.829
Right.

21:48.829 --> 21:53.616
This is a genetic library
of selected animalia from Earth,

21:53.616 --> 21:55.270
the ones most likely
to be of benefit.

22:01.276 --> 22:05.106
- What is this place?
- The only place we haven'’t
looked for Lane.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.896
Let me try.

22:18.032 --> 22:19.468
I'’ll have to
short-circuit the door.

22:33.700 --> 22:37.486
And this,
this is my favorite.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.489
The butterfly.

22:42.056 --> 22:45.929
The butterfly? Why?

22:45.929 --> 22:50.499
After the honeybees went
extinct, the butterflies
continued to pollinate.

22:50.499 --> 22:53.676
They'’re the only reason
the crops lasted on Earth
as long as they did.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.896
Yeah, but why
bring them to space?

22:55.896 --> 22:58.507
We need tools to create
a functioning ecosystem.

23:01.597 --> 23:03.338
Welcome to the toolbox.

23:05.514 --> 23:09.692
None of this
was covered in our briefings
during orientation.

23:09.692 --> 23:12.129
No, it wouldn'’t have been.

23:12.129 --> 23:15.829
Only high-level crew
were read in on this.

23:15.829 --> 23:19.354
Humans tend to get
a little touchy on
the subject of genetics.

23:19.354 --> 23:22.966
Did you hear that?

23:36.153 --> 23:39.896
Hello, Felix.
It'’s wonderful to see you again.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.376
Mrs. Trust?

23:55.738 --> 23:57.392
You gonna tell me
how you'’re lucky enough

23:57.392 --> 23:59.742
to be on a first-name basis
with Helena Trust?

23:59.742 --> 24:01.309
Not right now, I'’m not.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.888
- He'’s really here.
- Can you believe it?

24:14.888 --> 24:17.368
The William Trust
is on our ark.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.550
My brother'’s dead
because of you.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.987
You should'’ve stayed
on Earth to pay for what

24:26.987 --> 24:29.555
your stupid experiments did
to all those people.

24:29.555 --> 24:33.210
You'’d be dead, too,
if it wasn'’t for my husband's
stupid experiments.

24:33.210 --> 24:34.385
What do you think this ship is?

24:40.391 --> 24:41.871
Okay, let'’s go.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.314
Mr. and Mrs. Trust, I'’m--

24:50.314 --> 24:52.447
Brice! Stand down.
- Are you all right, sir?

24:52.447 --> 24:54.362
- What the hell
are you thinking?
- You.

24:54.362 --> 24:57.017
I--

24:57.017 --> 24:59.193
I knew someone
who had Klampkins.

24:59.193 --> 25:03.110
You gave them a death sentence.
It'’s your fault.

25:03.110 --> 25:05.242
Griff, please escort
Brice off the bridge.

25:05.242 --> 25:08.289
There'’s no need.
I'’m out of here.

25:14.121 --> 25:19.648
I apologize for his behavior.
I'’m Lieutenant Sharon Garnet.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.868
- Acting Captain.
- Pleasure to meet you.

25:21.868 --> 25:26.307
For your protection,
we'’d like you to remain
here with security

25:26.307 --> 25:28.439
while we determine
the best way to
acclimate you on board.

25:28.439 --> 25:30.616
We'’ll have food brought to you,
as well as our doctor

25:30.616 --> 25:33.488
check on your post-cryo vitals.

25:33.488 --> 25:38.493
As long as Felix is our guard,
that should be just fine.

25:52.855 --> 25:53.987
So that'’s how
you got the codes?

25:55.423 --> 25:56.555
How long have you known?

25:56.555 --> 25:59.949
Since Trent died.
I can explain.

25:59.949 --> 26:02.604
Later.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.519
Right now I'’m busy
trying to run this ship

26:04.519 --> 26:06.216
without being blindsided
at every turn.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.923
It'’s your fault
I'’m here, isn't it?

26:16.923 --> 26:18.620
You gave the order
to have me assigned
on this ark.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.580
Join the club.

26:23.538 --> 26:27.716
- Shouldn'’t you
be thanking me?
- Thanking you?

26:27.716 --> 26:29.762
Sure, thank you for
taking me from my family.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.154
Thank you for separating me

26:31.154 --> 26:33.461
from a now dead husband
and daughter.

26:33.461 --> 26:36.769
I'’m sorry about your family.

26:36.769 --> 26:39.119
But I can'’t apologize
for giving you a spot

26:39.119 --> 26:41.382
on the most sought after
trip of all time.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.950
I wasn'’t there
to protect them,
and that'’s on you.

26:43.950 --> 26:46.953
Did you ever consider
that you might be dead, too,
if you'’d stayed behind?

26:46.953 --> 26:50.739
You saved our lives,
so I saved yours.

26:55.439 --> 27:01.620
You can'’t trust Trust!
You can'’t trust Trust!

27:01.620 --> 27:05.406
- You can'’t trust Trust!
- Get down!

27:07.843 --> 27:09.628
Felix.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.980
I almost wish
I hadn'’t saved your lives.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.203
Griff, take over.

27:27.602 --> 27:32.215
Mr. Trust,
I'’m so honored to meet you.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.217
And I, you, my dear.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.004
Don'’t even think about it.

27:53.236 --> 27:56.326
Hey, you would not believe
the day I'’ve had.

27:56.326 --> 27:58.502
Searching for Lieutenant Lane,
working on the Maddox retrofit,

27:58.502 --> 27:59.982
reading through the archives.

27:59.982 --> 28:02.071
I'’ve never been so busy
in my entire life.

28:02.071 --> 28:05.771
- We were experimenting
with Angus'’ crops.
- Potato leek soup.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.425
Grilled veggies.
The possibilities are endless.

28:08.425 --> 28:10.123
Better than anything
I'’ve had in years.

28:13.213 --> 28:16.651
- You look different.
- You noticed.

28:16.651 --> 28:20.046
- I changed his hair.
- Do you like it?

28:22.222 --> 28:24.833
I liked it before.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.530
<i>I need you back
in engineering.</i>

28:26.530 --> 28:29.011
- Now? I barely got to eat.
- <i>Bring your food.</i>

28:30.796 --> 28:33.146
Um, I have to go.

28:47.421 --> 28:48.509
Lane.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.869
You wanted to explain?

29:00.869 --> 29:03.176
Trent sacrificed himself
to ensure the Trusts'’ survival,

29:03.176 --> 29:06.570
and he told me because
he knew I'’d understand
the gravity of the situation.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.398
So all this time
you'’ve been lying to me?

29:08.398 --> 29:11.314
- Well, I didn'’t lie.
- You lied by omission.

29:11.314 --> 29:14.100
You earned my trust,
my friendship even,

29:14.100 --> 29:16.537
- just so you could
keep this secret?
- Well, that'’s not true.

29:16.537 --> 29:20.367
- Our friendship was--
well, it is real.
- Why should I believe you?

29:20.367 --> 29:23.892
For all I know, everything
you'’ve ever done and said
over the past few weeks

29:23.892 --> 29:27.113
has been in service
of the Trusts and not
as my number two.

29:27.113 --> 29:30.290
I couldn'’t risk their existence
leaking to the entire crew.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.726
I'’m not saying you had
to tell the whole damn crew,

29:31.726 --> 29:34.555
- but you should'’ve told me.
- Or me.

29:34.555 --> 29:39.342
- We'’re supposed to be pals.
- If you can'’t trust Brice
and me with something

29:39.342 --> 29:42.868
- as critical as this,
then we can'’t trust you.
- Sharon.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.740
Effective immediately,
I am relieving you
of your duties

29:45.740 --> 29:48.134
and stripping you
of your rank of lieutenant.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.570
You'’re not serious.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.662
You can'’t do this.

29:54.662 --> 29:59.580
She can, and she should.

29:59.580 --> 30:02.365
As of this moment,
you are no longer
an officer on this ship.

30:36.008 --> 30:38.967
Did you connect
the negative mass generator?

30:38.967 --> 30:41.970
Yep, and the negative energy
density meter is hooked up

30:41.970 --> 30:45.800
to the ship'’s forward
propulsion system.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.193
I know everything
about this ship.

30:47.193 --> 30:49.151
I don'’t have a damn clue
what just said.

30:49.151 --> 30:51.023
It'’s basic theoretical physics.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.939
Although I guess it'’s not
that theoretical anymore.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.289
You guess?

30:56.289 --> 30:58.944
So we'’re sending our ship
hurtling into the unknown
on a guess?

30:58.944 --> 31:03.949
Technically our ship
won'’t be hurtling.
It won'’t move at all.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.995
Space will warp around us.

31:06.995 --> 31:09.824
Ark 3 was using the tech
and it worked just fine.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.484
<i>Maddox retrofit
successfully interfaced</i>

31:17.484 --> 31:19.921
<i>with Nuclear Electronic
Propulsion System.</i>

31:19.921 --> 31:22.010
<i>Ready to initiate
faster than light.</i>

31:22.010 --> 31:23.838
Um, what are
our chances of dying

31:23.838 --> 31:25.796
if we turn this thing on?

31:25.796 --> 31:26.841
Guess we'’re gonna find out.

31:37.373 --> 31:41.203
We should'’ve been honored
upon our arrival.
Not in need of security.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.205
Humans beings are many things,

31:43.205 --> 31:45.642
including unforgiving
and spiteful beasts.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.476
I thought things
would be different here.

31:53.476 --> 31:57.611
I thought we could start over.
I did this for us.

31:57.611 --> 32:00.962
Because I wanted
my husband back.

32:00.962 --> 32:04.879
- To be us again.
- This crew have been working
together to stay alive

32:04.879 --> 32:07.055
since they were
abruptly woken up.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.318
We are interlopers
in their journey.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.799
So show them your value.

32:15.846 --> 32:17.457
Well, who are they?

32:17.457 --> 32:19.633
Chief Engineer
and Chief of Life Support.

32:19.633 --> 32:22.505
The one in the glasses
is our resident genius.

32:27.162 --> 32:29.469
We'’ve successfully installed
the Maddox retrofit.

32:29.469 --> 32:31.297
The start-up sequence
is up and running.

32:31.297 --> 32:33.255
All we have to do
is initiate FTL

32:33.255 --> 32:34.300
and then we'’ll be on our way.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.693
We'’ll get to Prox B in no time.

32:36.693 --> 32:39.827
Are you saying
that slimy serpent Maddox
actually did it?

32:39.827 --> 32:41.307
She resolved the negative
energy problem?

32:41.307 --> 32:44.266
Yes. She built on
the foundational principles

32:44.266 --> 32:46.573
that you laid out in
all your research, Mr. Trust,

32:46.573 --> 32:48.444
using the NEPS
to create negative energy.

32:48.444 --> 32:50.490
That'’s a simple solution.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.274
It'’s too simple,
and it'’s too risky.

32:52.274 --> 32:53.449
Says the man who sprayed
a dangerous chemical

32:53.449 --> 32:54.973
over a whole continent.

32:56.931 --> 32:59.499
It would be a shame to die
by flipping one faulty switch

32:59.499 --> 33:01.762
after working so hard
to stay alive.

33:01.762 --> 33:04.721
- There'’s no faulty switch.
- And how long have
you been an expert

33:04.721 --> 33:06.158
in faster than light retrofits?

33:06.158 --> 33:07.898
Every minute we go sub-light

33:07.898 --> 33:09.726
the more U-238 we burn through

33:09.726 --> 33:11.293
and the less likely
we'’ll have enough

33:11.293 --> 33:14.079
to fuel the negative energy
to jump to FTL.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.776
- Is that true?
- Yes.

33:15.776 --> 33:18.257
But it regenerates fuel at FTL.

33:18.257 --> 33:21.129
Look, Evelyn liked
to take shortcuts.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.697
We just need to make sure
that she didn'’t take any

33:23.697 --> 33:24.915
with something
as important as this.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.569
You can'’t tell us
not to use the tech

33:26.569 --> 33:27.831
just '’cause you don't like
the lady who invented it.

33:30.965 --> 33:35.535
- Eva?
- It worked fine on Ark 3.

33:35.535 --> 33:38.494
Um, based on the video,
it worked on Ark 15, too.

33:38.494 --> 33:43.804
- Brice, opinion?
- I trust Eva and Alicia.

33:46.154 --> 33:48.026
So if we don'’t do this now,
there'’s a chance we might not

33:48.026 --> 33:49.462
have enough fuel
to do it at all?

33:49.462 --> 33:51.725
Every minute we wait
lessens the chances.

33:54.554 --> 33:57.035
Sounds like
we don'’t have a choice.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.819
Initiate
faster than light travel.

34:09.351 --> 34:10.961
<i>Initiating faster than light...</i>

34:10.961 --> 34:12.311
- Please work, please work.
- <i>in three...</i>

34:12.311 --> 34:14.922
- Proxima B, here we come.
- <i>two...</i>

34:14.922 --> 34:16.010
<i>one.</i>

34:30.851 --> 34:32.070
FTL is stable.

34:38.641 --> 34:39.468
What'’s happening to us?

34:41.644 --> 34:42.602
What'’s happening to us?

34:42.602 --> 34:44.995
I warned you.

34:44.995 --> 34:45.996
A simple solution.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.128
Too simple.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.435
And too risky.

34:49.435 --> 34:50.262
You should'’ve trusted me.

35:02.361 --> 35:03.884
Can we drop out
of FTL from here?

35:09.455 --> 35:10.804
I can'’t.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.240
We have to get
to the engine room.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.111
How?

35:16.288 --> 35:17.680
We follow our future selves.

35:30.432 --> 35:33.174
Follow me.
Just focus on the destination.

35:36.090 --> 35:39.485
- How?
- Time will catch up to our goal

35:39.485 --> 35:41.835
if you just keep in your head
where you need to go.

35:43.706 --> 35:46.274
Follow me.
Focus on the destination.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.757
Not as easy as it sounds.

35:53.673 --> 35:56.850
- How did we get here?
- How long have we been here?

35:56.850 --> 35:59.287
Irrelevant. Remember...

36:00.462 --> 36:02.377
Remember what?

36:02.377 --> 36:04.292
You were telling us
to remember to do something.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.338
Was I?

36:06.338 --> 36:07.861
It'’s getting worse,
isn'’t it?

36:07.861 --> 36:10.124
- My head hurts.
- Ready to launch EMP.

36:10.124 --> 36:13.083
How did you beat me here?
I thought I got here first.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.477
- How long have we been here?
- Did you say launch EMP?

36:15.477 --> 36:19.351
Exactly. She is ahead of us.
Or she was momentarily.

36:19.351 --> 36:22.658
But we don'’t have an EMP,
and even if we did,
that could destroy the ship.

36:22.658 --> 36:26.575
Remember, I built this ship.
The EMP is a fail-safe.

36:26.575 --> 36:29.535
It'’s a minuscule pulse
designed to target
the engines specifically.

36:29.535 --> 36:32.102
It shouldn'’t affect life support
or other systems on the ship.

36:34.931 --> 36:37.064
I wasn'’t told about
any fail-safe.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.979
You weren'’t supposed
to be in charge.

36:38.979 --> 36:41.764
- This is the only way.
- How do you know?

36:41.764 --> 36:44.332
Because I'’ve been
working to develop this
for a long time.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.900
First we have to prep
to disconnect the retrofit.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.337
But do not remove it
from the circuit board
until I tell you to.

36:53.428 --> 36:55.343
- My head hurts.
- Focus.

36:55.343 --> 36:56.997
- Ready to launch EMP.
- Almost there.

36:56.997 --> 36:58.999
- My head hurts.
- It'’s getting worse, isn't it?

36:58.999 --> 37:01.131
- How long have we been here?
- Did you say launch EMP?

37:01.131 --> 37:02.916
Focus. Almost there.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.006
Now.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.324
- It worked!
- Thank you.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.021
You'’re welcome.

37:29.551 --> 37:31.597
They did it.

37:31.597 --> 37:34.600
I'’ve got to be honest.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.341
I really thought traveling
faster than the speed of light

37:36.341 --> 37:39.735
was gonna be a little more fun.

37:50.659 --> 37:54.228
Lieutenant Garnet,
we weren'’t expecting you.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.361
Our cryo pods weren'’t that nice.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.319
I looked for you in med bay.

37:58.319 --> 38:01.366
They told me I'’d find you here.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.281
I wasn'’t quite
ready to be amongst
the general populace yet.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.632
I came here to apologize.

38:06.632 --> 38:10.026
It'’s taken us a long time
to figure out how
to run this ship.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.072
I didn'’t know where
your allegiances were.

38:15.205 --> 38:20.559
Being leader is like
waking up to your house
on fire every day.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.343
You have to trust your gut.

38:22.343 --> 38:26.042
And if you choose wrong,
it'’s up to you to own it.

38:26.042 --> 38:29.045
I hope after our rough start

38:29.045 --> 38:30.395
you'’ll still agree to help us

38:30.395 --> 38:32.353
get the Maddox retrofit
up and running.

38:32.353 --> 38:36.096
I think you still don'’t see
the big picture, Lieutenant.

38:38.446 --> 38:41.754
- And what'’s that?
- That we all want
the same thing.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.625
To survive.

38:48.674 --> 38:51.894
You were amazing today.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.378
I mean in
the engine room earlier.

38:57.378 --> 39:01.774
But, well, that as well.

39:01.774 --> 39:04.429
This was the last time
we do this.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.648
No more slip-ups.

39:06.648 --> 39:09.651
So, um, is that all
I am to you then, is it?

39:09.651 --> 39:12.132
Just a-- a slip-up?

39:15.614 --> 39:17.137
What?

39:19.052 --> 39:21.663
The archives from Ark 3

39:21.663 --> 39:22.925
might have the cure
for Klampkins.

39:27.321 --> 39:31.499
You know, it'’s starting
to sound a little bit
like you care about me.

39:31.499 --> 39:34.284
I just-- I don'’t believe
you want to die.

39:34.284 --> 39:38.463
I don'’t want to die,
but I'’m going to.

39:42.336 --> 39:44.120
If there'’s a cure,
don'’t you want to know?

39:44.120 --> 39:46.514
- There isn'’t.
- How do you know?

39:48.951 --> 39:51.650
Eva, do you know
how many times I'’ve been told
they'’re gonna find a cure?

39:51.650 --> 39:52.781
No.

39:54.479 --> 39:56.524
Yeah, well, neither do I.

39:56.524 --> 39:59.353
Because I'’ve lost count.
That'’s how many.

39:59.353 --> 40:02.704
I did every clinical trial
back on Earth. Everything.

40:02.704 --> 40:05.751
Trying not to die
because my obsession,

40:05.751 --> 40:07.535
and I won'’t let it
become yours as well.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.365
Look.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.761
Eva, I don'’t want you
to fall in love with another man

40:15.761 --> 40:16.979
just in time to watch him die.

40:20.243 --> 40:24.160
I loved Harris. I still do.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.249
And I'’m not going
to fall in love with you.

40:26.249 --> 40:28.774
I'’m gonna hold you to that.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.906
But that doesn'’t mean
you should stop trying.

40:30.906 --> 40:33.082
Just stop.

40:33.082 --> 40:37.173
Look, I came
to terms with my death
a long time ago, right?

40:37.173 --> 40:41.439
So neither of us
need to pretend that this
is gonna end any other way.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.485
Let'’s just leave it. Yeah?

40:54.756 --> 40:56.149
I'’ve been waiting
for you to come see me.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.329
We'’re overdue a session
since you woke up.

41:02.329 --> 41:04.418
That'’s what we're
calling it now, is it?

41:04.418 --> 41:05.854
A session?

41:12.426 --> 41:14.167
I thought
I'’d never see you again.

41:14.167 --> 41:15.951
I guess fate had other plans.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.866
By fate, you mean Helena.

41:17.866 --> 41:19.781
Good job
she didn'’t know about us,

41:19.781 --> 41:21.566
otherwise she'’d never
put me on this ark with you.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.742
So we won'’t let her find out.

41:25.395 --> 41:29.225
How'’s the Juno Project going?

41:29.225 --> 41:32.054
Can we forget about work?
Just for a little while.

41:34.013 --> 41:36.537
Look, I don'’t know
what'’s going to happen next,

41:36.537 --> 41:40.106
but can I count on you
to stand by my side?

41:40.106 --> 41:42.804
- No matter what happens?
- Of course you can.

41:42.804 --> 41:44.153
There'’s no place
I'’d rather be.

42:06.262 --> 42:10.266
Mr. Trust,
I'’ve been looking for you.

42:10.266 --> 42:12.834
Lieutenant Lane,
good to see you.

42:12.834 --> 42:14.706
"Lieutenant."

42:14.706 --> 42:17.273
Look, for what it'’s worth,

42:17.273 --> 42:19.580
I don'’t agree with the decision
regarding your title.

42:19.580 --> 42:21.756
Well, from you, sir,
that'’s worth a lot.

42:21.756 --> 42:23.366
You have courage and grit,

42:23.366 --> 42:25.586
the stuff that
real leaders are made of.

42:25.586 --> 42:28.284
- Unapologetic in the wake
of your decisions.
- Yeah.

42:28.284 --> 42:30.852
I want you to know,
whatever you need,
I'’m your man.

42:30.852 --> 42:35.509
After what they did to me,
let'’s just say

42:35.509 --> 42:38.294
that now my only remaining
loyalty lies with you.
