WEBVTT

00:07.923 --> 00:09.687
- Ha ha!
- Time to protect the sun.

00:09.758 --> 00:11.089
Ha ha, yeah.

00:11.157 --> 00:13.125
He knows how to get
things started.

00:13.192 --> 00:14.683
Fire pit number 1.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.728
Easy-peasy, livin' greasy.

00:16.794 --> 00:18.989
You wonder why they
even put it there.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.996
It's probably a computel gleech.

00:21.996 --> 00:23.327
Now comes some real trouble.

00:23.397 --> 00:25.092
It's Bouncy Bee.

00:25.164 --> 00:26.529
He's gonna get that sun, man.

00:26.598 --> 00:28.032
Ha ha, please.

00:28.099 --> 00:29.759
Bleep. - Ha ha!

00:29.832 --> 00:31.663
I had my eyes
closed on that one.

00:31.733 --> 00:33.326
Yeah, that was cool.

00:33.402 --> 00:35.562
Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude.
Go back.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.159
I ain't in it for
the money, man.

00:37.236 --> 00:39.602
I'm in it to crush the
enemies of the sun,

00:39.671 --> 00:41.604
like this sloppy
butt right here.

00:41.672 --> 00:42.832
Hunny bunny.

00:42.905 --> 00:45.100
I'm like, "Hunny Bunny,
don't you ever learn?

00:45.173 --> 00:47.107
I've always got the bombuh."

00:48.441 --> 00:49.533
Man, you are hot tonight.

00:49.608 --> 00:50.808
Think you can do it this time?

00:50.841 --> 00:52.309
Can you beat Sleepy Sam?

00:52.376 --> 00:54.036
Oh, I very can.

00:54.109 --> 00:56.236
Remember, use a combo move.

00:56.311 --> 00:57.835
Okay, here it goes.

00:57.911 --> 00:59.970
Up, down, left, left,

01:00.046 --> 01:01.674
right, right, down.

01:01.746 --> 01:02.975
Spin, down, up, left.

01:03.047 --> 01:03.912
Faster, dude.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.743
Right, left, down.

01:10.084 --> 01:11.983
Ohh! Every time!

01:12.051 --> 01:14.019
Beemo, this game is the worst.

01:14.085 --> 01:15.712
If we were really
inside that game,

01:15.786 --> 01:18.721
man, we would crush
Sleepy Sam, breezily...

01:18.787 --> 01:20.619
with my mitts.

01:20.689 --> 01:21.747
Oh, no.

01:21.822 --> 01:23.413
It's much more dangerous
than you think.

01:23.488 --> 01:24.512
Whoa, whoa, wait!

01:24.590 --> 01:25.632
Beemo, is there a way for us

01:25.656 --> 01:27.181
to get in the game for real?

01:27.258 --> 01:28.622
Yes, of course, Jake.

01:28.691 --> 01:30.818
If I push this button...

01:32.893 --> 01:35.224
If <i>I</i> push this button,

01:35.294 --> 01:37.284
you will both be
dangerously transported

01:37.361 --> 01:39.795
into my main-brain-game-frame,

01:39.862 --> 01:41.352
where it is very dangerous.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.864
Oh, man! Oh, Beemo!

01:42.931 --> 01:44.074
You got to let us in that game.

01:44.098 --> 01:47.498
No. It's a far-too-dangerous
incredible adventure for you.

01:47.566 --> 01:48.897
That's final.

01:48.967 --> 01:52.094
Oh. Okay, Beemo.

01:52.169 --> 01:54.363
Well, time for bed.

01:54.436 --> 01:55.528
Finn?

01:55.603 --> 01:58.629
Time for bed, right, Jake?

01:58.705 --> 02:00.605
Oh, right.

02:01.606 --> 02:03.039
Good night, Beemo.

02:03.106 --> 02:04.801
Time for bed.

Wow! Whoa!

02:31.552 --> 02:32.678
Whoa!

02:32.752 --> 02:34.310
We're in the game!

02:34.386 --> 02:36.944
Look, there's the sunshine
we got to protect.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.954
And there's the hole we're
supposed to go down.

02:39.021 --> 02:40.546
And there's you...

02:40.623 --> 02:42.180
doing whatever you're doing.

02:42.256 --> 02:43.724
I'm looking at my bits.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.689
My leg is math!

02:45.758 --> 02:48.419
Mm, that sunshine feels good.

02:48.492 --> 02:50.221
Feels good all over.

02:50.293 --> 02:51.813
No wonder all the
monsters in this game

02:51.860 --> 02:53.452
want to get their
grubby mitts on it.

02:53.527 --> 02:56.394
Let's go kick their
digital bootays!

02:56.463 --> 02:57.725
Doot-doot.

02:57.796 --> 02:59.262
Doot-doot-doot.

Pit!

03:21.039 --> 03:23.269
Looks a mite bigger
inside the game.

03:23.340 --> 03:25.831
Jumping over this pit
is easy, remember?

03:25.908 --> 03:29.398
We can do this backwards

Aah! I'm burning!

You still have two left.

makes you die in real life?

03:54.453 --> 03:55.647
Or worse?

03:55.720 --> 03:58.211
That makes me just want
to sit here and feel bad.

03:58.289 --> 03:59.847
No way, man.

03:59.922 --> 04:03.152
We're gonna cross that
hole with real-world grit.

04:03.224 --> 04:04.486
Come on!

04:04.557 --> 04:05.889
Faster, Jake.

04:05.959 --> 04:08.586
Get ready to stretch it.

04:08.660 --> 04:10.820
Watch out, Jake!

04:10.894 --> 04:12.418
Wow!

04:12.495 --> 04:13.495
Whew!

04:13.528 --> 04:14.995
That was pretty intense, dude.

04:15.062 --> 04:16.892
We're pretty intense dudes.

04:16.963 --> 04:18.156
Yeah!

04:19.598 --> 04:21.463
What's that sound?

04:21.531 --> 04:23.796
It sounds like...

04:23.866 --> 04:25.959
Bouncy Bee!

04:26.034 --> 04:28.695
Whoa!

04:28.769 --> 04:30.759
Hyah! Ho!

04:32.337 --> 04:35.169
You ready to flippin'
this guy up, Jake?

04:35.238 --> 04:37.933
Easy peasy, livin' greasy.

04:45.909 --> 04:49.139
No!

04:49.210 --> 04:51.144
Finn's dead.

04:51.211 --> 04:54.668
Finn, no. Why?

04:56.280 --> 05:00.409
No!!

05:00.482 --> 05:02.881
Curse this false virtual world.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.546
Oh, Finn.

05:06.618 --> 05:07.813
Yo, what up?

05:07.885 --> 05:09.614
Oh, Finn! You're alive.

05:09.686 --> 05:11.586
Yeah, I got extra lives, man.

05:11.653 --> 05:12.985
Oh, my gosh.

05:13.055 --> 05:14.851
Let's never die again.

05:14.921 --> 05:18.014
There's nothing more
precious than a life.

05:18.089 --> 05:20.216
Ooh, dude, look... coins.

05:20.291 --> 05:21.553
Oh, man! Oh, man!

05:21.625 --> 05:23.990
Hee, hee, hee.

05:24.059 --> 05:25.117
Ooh!

05:25.192 --> 05:27.126
Oh, man, dude, these
coins are thick.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.127
Let's take them back
to the real world.

05:29.194 --> 05:31.661
We'll be filthy, stinking rich.

05:35.364 --> 05:36.762
Whoa!

05:36.830 --> 05:38.662
Hunny Bunny!

05:41.199 --> 05:42.199
N-o-o-o!

05:44.400 --> 05:47.836
Time to use the bombuh.

05:47.902 --> 05:50.563
Come to me, bombuh.

05:50.636 --> 05:52.661
Bombuh!

05:53.870 --> 05:55.838
Oh, bombuh,

05:55.905 --> 05:58.306
I can't select you
without my controller.

05:59.973 --> 06:01.305
Let's get out of here, Finn.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.342
Man, we never run away
from Hunny Bunny.

06:04.843 --> 06:06.309
Aah!

06:06.376 --> 06:09.004
Fire pit, Bouncy
Bee, Hunny Bunny...

06:09.078 --> 06:10.875
They're supposed to
be the easy parts.

06:10.945 --> 06:12.913
They're all hard as butts.

06:12.979 --> 06:15.970
Sleepy Sam is gonna be the
ultimate butt-kicker.

06:16.048 --> 06:18.277
Look, Finn, the most
important thing to remember

06:18.349 --> 06:21.909
is that I still have
one giant coin.

06:21.983 --> 06:23.848
Man, get ahold of your brains.

06:23.918 --> 06:25.749
We need to stay alert
for Sleepy Sam.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.252
Hey, that's him right there.

06:27.318 --> 06:28.980
Get down.

06:29.053 --> 06:31.180
What's he doing?

06:32.254 --> 06:34.279
He's probably trying
to psyche me out.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.815
I'm gonna break you, Sam.

06:41.891 --> 06:44.485
When I'm done, they'll
call you, uh...

06:44.560 --> 06:46.493
Stinky Sam...

06:46.561 --> 06:49.256
stupid frog.

07:01.467 --> 07:04.026
Aah!

07:05.502 --> 07:06.434
Ugh!

07:06.503 --> 07:08.902
My... my mitts didn't...
Didn't work.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.165
Come on, help me punch him.

07:11.238 --> 07:12.238
Okay!

07:14.239 --> 07:15.536
Roar!

07:22.042 --> 07:23.567
Let's get out of here, man!

07:23.643 --> 07:24.643
We're gonna die!

07:37.282 --> 07:38.510
I can see the lights.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.278
We're almost there!

07:40.350 --> 07:41.510
Ugh!

07:41.584 --> 07:43.552
Oh, no, man. It's the
edge of the screen.

07:43.618 --> 07:45.449
We're trapped, and they'll
be here any second.

07:45.519 --> 07:47.452
Wait, dude. The bombuh.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.112
We can't get the bombuh.

07:49.187 --> 07:50.677
Wait, dude.

07:50.755 --> 07:53.883
Hmm. - Jake? Jake?

07:53.956 --> 07:55.185
What if I...

07:55.256 --> 07:56.723
That's not how it works.

07:58.091 --> 07:59.990
Error, error, error.

08:00.058 --> 08:01.492
Jake, let go of that.

08:01.559 --> 08:02.890
But we need the bombuh.

08:04.427 --> 08:06.554
Whoops.

08:07.828 --> 08:09.056
Finn!

08:12.397 --> 08:13.397
Huh?

08:15.999 --> 08:17.727
Oh, holy cow!

08:17.799 --> 08:19.028
That was nuts, man!

08:19.100 --> 08:19.998
Yeah, man.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.365
And I got my coin.

08:21.435 --> 08:23.129
What?! A penny?!

08:24.201 --> 08:25.965
Beemo! Oh, no!

08:26.036 --> 08:27.503
Are you all right, buddy?

08:28.505 --> 08:29.802
You... you have to... y-you...

08:29.872 --> 08:30.804
Oh, no!

08:30.872 --> 08:32.339
Too late! Run!

08:41.144 --> 08:42.610
Aah!

08:42.676 --> 08:44.234
No. No. No.

08:44.311 --> 08:45.654
Don't kill us. We don't
have extra lives.

08:45.678 --> 08:46.508
No!

08:46.578 --> 08:48.341
Whoa, wait. Hold up, guys.

08:48.412 --> 08:50.972
Check it out. Sunshine.

08:54.783 --> 08:57.080
Oh, boy. That feels good.

08:57.150 --> 08:58.981
All right.

08:59.050 --> 09:00.779
See you later, Sam.

09:00.851 --> 09:03.251
You mean that's it?
You're not gonna kill us?

09:03.319 --> 09:05.582
No, of course not.

09:05.653 --> 09:06.950
The game's over. We won.

09:07.020 --> 09:10.079
All we wanted was
the sunshine...

09:10.155 --> 09:11.417
and to kill that computer

09:11.488 --> 09:13.166
that's been imprisoning
us for so many years.

09:13.190 --> 09:14.656
What?

09:14.723 --> 09:15.723
Help! Oh, no!

09:15.757 --> 09:16.757
Beemo!

09:16.791 --> 09:18.282
Oh, sure, he's dangerous.

09:18.359 --> 09:20.588
If he hits his button
again, back we go.

09:20.659 --> 09:22.752
Beemo, quick! Hit your button!

09:22.827 --> 09:25.989
I-I can't, Finn. I'm stuck.

09:26.061 --> 09:27.892
You want him to hit his button?!

09:27.962 --> 09:29.521
What's wrong with you?!

09:29.597 --> 09:31.257
We'll save you, Beemo.

09:31.330 --> 09:32.524
Finn, go!

09:32.597 --> 09:35.259
They're too strong. Use
the combo move, Finn.

09:35.332 --> 09:36.629
The combo move!

09:36.699 --> 09:38.826
Combo move? That never works.

09:38.901 --> 09:41.027
Listen, you got this, man.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.626
I know you...

09:42.702 --> 09:43.779
I know you can do it, buddy.

09:43.803 --> 09:46.101
You got this!

09:46.170 --> 09:48.105
Okay, okay. You got this, Finn.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.833
For your friends.

09:51.472 --> 09:54.339
Up, down, left, left, right,

09:54.407 --> 09:57.137
right, down, spin, down, up,

09:57.209 --> 09:59.699
left, right, left, down, spin,

09:59.776 --> 10:00.776
up, down, jump!

10:02.944 --> 10:05.538
Aah!

10:05.612 --> 10:08.842
Aah!

10:10.548 --> 10:11.776
Whoa. - Whoo-hoo!

10:11.848 --> 10:13.406
You did it, Finn!

10:13.482 --> 10:15.074
I knew you had the stuff.

10:15.149 --> 10:16.149
Right, Beemo?

10:16.184 --> 10:17.515
Ohh!

10:18.984 --> 10:20.508
- Oh, crud.
- Beemo!

10:20.585 --> 10:22.053
I'm sorry, buddy.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.553
Finn, I told you about the
danger, and now look...

10:24.620 --> 10:27.588
You fricasseed my stuff and
broke our house all up.

10:27.655 --> 10:29.145
I know, I know.

10:29.222 --> 10:31.781
I was double-butt, for real.

10:31.857 --> 10:34.154
But, man, now that we
know what to expect,

10:34.224 --> 10:36.317
next time will be way more fun.

10:36.392 --> 10:37.518
Yeah, yeah!

10:37.592 --> 10:39.617
How about it, Beemo? You in?

10:40.827 --> 10:42.818
Hey, don't do the

10:42.894 --> 10:44.226
W-We were only joking.

10:44.296 --> 10:45.854
Beemo! Stop messing around.

10:45.929 --> 10:48.159
Left, down...

10:49.305 --> 10:55.532
