SERAFINA: Angels?

00:04.520 --> 00:07.600
If Asriel has angels on his side,
he can do anything.

00:07.640 --> 00:11.440
I will bring Asriel back
and destroy the Magisterium together.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.120
We must find Lyra.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.800

JOPARI: Do you think
you can fly through it?

00:21.280 --> 00:23.440
Just make yourself comfortable, Mr Jopari.

00:23.480 --> 00:26.000
WILL: Ask the alethiometer
where my father is.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.240
He's in this world.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.800
LYRA: My job is to help Will
find his father.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.400
SERAFINA: Our task is to protect you,
Lyra.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.680
We will help you find Will's father.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.800
Can you stay for a bit? Look after us?

00:37.840 --> 00:40.800
I've been sent here
to do something important.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.160
We'll be fine.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.720
We've got each other.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.440
Wait!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.600
I'll bring you to your adults.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.880
- BOREAL: We can't go after them.
- MRS COULTER: We have to.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.720
BOREAL: How do you control them?

00:54.760 --> 00:57.080
MRS COULTER: Well, they consume
what makes us human,

00:57.120 --> 00:58.760
so I just...

00:58.800 --> 00:59.880
...hid that from them.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.280
Boreal, I don't need you.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.240
You would only hold me back.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.920
It would have been so much easier
if you'd told me about Lyra

01:07.960 --> 01:09.760
when you first had her.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.120
FRA PAVEL: I've discovered the girl
has another name.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.920
The witches know it from a prophecy.
It's heresy, beyond doubt.

01:15.960 --> 01:17.560
What is the child's name?

01:19.000 --> 01:25.560
Fra Pavel has brought me information
of a threat so grave in nature,

01:25.600 --> 01:28.120
we will do whatever is necessary.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.680
We have sent troops through the anomaly.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.960
and so cold.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.880
Life or death meant nothing.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.360
Just rest.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.600
Stay calm. Give yourself a chance to heal.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.480
You're not safe here.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.440
You can leave us.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.000
No, Lyra. We won't do that.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.440
But, Will, once we've found your father,
we must leave this world.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.120
Let's hope we find him fast.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.360
Your knife frightened them.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.120
I'm frightened.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.120
I saw my father, and I'm scared.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.600
She can't see the fear.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.040
Your fear.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.760
Can't she?

05:59.800 --> 06:02.520
She thinks you're the bravest fighter
she's ever seen.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.680
As brave as Iorek Byrnison,

06:06.720 --> 06:08.600
King of the Armoured Bears.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.720
Iorek Byrnison.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.480
That's a compliment.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.000
Well, I think Lyra's even braver than me.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.160
She can be.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.520
But...sometimes she's not.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.200
She's the best friend I ever had.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.880
You know that?

06:31.560 --> 06:33.840
Not that I've had many friends.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.800
You're her best friend, too.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.480
Now, sleep.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.000
Maybe you'll feel better in the morning.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.160
I'm no longer an aeronaut.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.160
We're insects now, travelling the world
just like all the others.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.840
You couldn't be an insect if you tried,
Lee.

07:29.320 --> 07:30.600
The shaman's on his feet.

07:34.600 --> 07:35.960
I know where the Bearer is.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.360
We must go west, to a canyon.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.480
You picked a good spot, Mr Scoresby,

07:44.520 --> 07:47.840
but that last Magisterium airship
will have landed by now.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.360
They'll be looking for us.

LENA: I have another problem for you,

09:28.040 --> 09:32.080
Jabar has seen an adult with a daemon
wandering the city.

09:32.120 --> 09:35.320
If they're from our world,
they may not know the dangers here.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.280
There were other children on that rooftop.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.360
Start there. Check they're safe.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.400
I'll send Jabar back with news.

before we continue searching
for Will's father.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.920

There!

10:19.320 --> 10:21.000

10:27.880 --> 10:30.040
Well, go on, then. Skedaddle.

You could come too. We like you, miss.

that's where to look for them.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.080
Bye, miss.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.240
Thank you.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.760
I was delighted to help.

11:38.360 --> 11:42.920
Serafina wants to scout ahead. She wants
to know exactly where these Spectres are.

11:42.960 --> 11:46.360
She's sending Lena down to the city
and Reina out to the forest.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.280
- If we can track their movements...
- Spectres only affect adults.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.560
We should go on without them,
for their sake and ours.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.440
They'll keep us safe.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.240
For the first time in a long time,
I'm close to my father.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.400
It's time I go find him.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.960
I can't stop thinking about
what my mother said.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.400
That I'd take up his mantle,

12:08.440 --> 12:11.360
carry on whatever he went into
the other worlds to do.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.640
I think that's why the alethiometer's
telling us to find him.

12:14.680 --> 12:18.280
- It's connecting us.
- We can help him, Lyra.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.560
I heard what Pan said last night.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.560

12:29.720 --> 12:31.840
And I heard what you said.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.920
I've had a best friend.

12:41.040 --> 12:43.520
And I let that best friend down.

12:48.960 --> 12:52.960
- Maybe this is how I let you down.
- You haven't let me down.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.400
You've made me stronger, Lyra.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.800
I've made you stronger.

13:00.320 --> 13:03.600
But we need to go on our own,

- You should leave.
- And a boy?

to rage against the Magisterium.

He told me this war
has to be bigger than them,

that, in every world, agents of

- He intends to fight the Authority.
- And he needs us.

If this is the Great War,
then she will be needed.

(WHIMPERS)

22:55.840 --> 22:57.520
What are you frightened of?

22:59.160 --> 23:00.240
Hmm?

23:03.080 --> 23:04.320
Her?

23:05.520 --> 23:10.840
Lyra is special. Lyra is Eve.
We must prevent the Fall.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.840
We have to do whatever it takes

23:27.880 --> 23:29.320
to keep her safe.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.520
I will find her.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.320
Come to me.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.400

24:34.720 --> 24:36.600
(LEE PANTS)

24:42.080 --> 24:43.960
- You all right?
- Yeah.

24:45.480 --> 24:48.640
Look, we're not going to outrun them now.
One of us needs to stay and fight them off

24:48.680 --> 24:51.080
if we stand a fighting chance.
Give me your gun.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.080
I'm no shaman,
but let me make a prediction.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.400
If I leave you here, you die.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.640
If we don't get the protection to Lyra,
all of this will be for nothing.

24:57.680 --> 25:01.000
- Mr Scoresby...
- Listen, I've weighed all the options.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.720
I've made my choice.

25:02.760 --> 25:05.000
You're it.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.480
Find the bear.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.600
You're a good man.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.680
Just remember your promise.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.800
I love that little girl like a daughter.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.480
I remember.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.400
You have my word.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.520
I'll make sure she's protected
by the Knife.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.800
That's all I need to know.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.880
(DISTANT SHOUTING)

25:29.480 --> 25:31.560
- (SHOUTING)
- Go on.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.480
Listen...

25:41.520 --> 25:43.600
...if this were anyone else,
it'd be suicidal.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.120
But I'm a fine shot.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.480
Goodbye, Mr Scoresby.

(FIRES)

25:52.880 --> 25:56.480
(CONTINUES FIRING)

26:00.720 --> 26:02.760
I think I'm changing, Pan.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.800
I like you just as you are.

26:05.840 --> 26:09.480
Once I change, you'll stop changing.

26:11.200 --> 26:14.000
- What do you think you'll be?
- A flea, I hope.

26:16.040 --> 26:19.200
Is it Will that's changing you?

26:22.800 --> 26:24.280
A bit.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.040
I don't think I'm ready
for things to change.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.480
I don't think anyone ever is.

26:53.160 --> 26:56.120
A fox, after nearly crossing the stream,

26:56.160 --> 26:58.480
gets his tail in the water.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.840
(MUMBLES)

27:08.600 --> 27:10.680
The task at hand is not yet completed.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.720
It promises success,
but proceed with caution.

27:35.960 --> 27:38.360
- I'm out.
- HESTER: Come on. Let's move.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.800
Remember the games we used to play
when we were little?

27:54.840 --> 27:57.480
- The Alamo.
- Ha! The Alamo.

27:57.520 --> 27:59.560
Take it in turns being Danes and French.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.080
They're still coming. (SNIFFS)

28:02.120 --> 28:03.760
How many bullets do we have left?

28:04.800 --> 28:05.920
About 30.

28:08.320 --> 28:12.440
Well, let's make every single last one
count, then.

28:20.120 --> 28:22.320
I don't like taking lives, Hester.

28:22.360 --> 28:26.160
- It's ours or theirs.
- It's theirs or Lyra's.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.360
On the right!

28:30.040 --> 28:32.680
(GUNFIRE)

28:32.720 --> 28:35.040
- I'm running out of bullets.
- Don't think about that.

28:35.080 --> 28:36.280
What should I think about?

28:36.320 --> 28:39.120
Think about anything. Think about bacon!
Just keep shooting.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.480
Over by the back boulder!

28:46.160 --> 28:49.080
It's nothing big.
A bullet clipped your scalp,

28:49.120 --> 28:50.600
but no great damage.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.040
(GUNSHOT)

28:52.080 --> 28:53.480
Did you count how many fell?

28:53.520 --> 28:55.400
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

28:55.440 --> 28:56.920
This is my fault, isn't it?

28:58.120 --> 28:59.640
How do you figure?

28:59.680 --> 29:01.520
I've always stopped you before.

29:01.560 --> 29:02.960
(SCOFFS)

29:03.000 --> 29:04.720
You always pushed me.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.280
Only when there's an adventure

29:06.320 --> 29:07.840
- on the way.
- Hester.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.280
There were always adventures.

29:29.800 --> 29:30.920
Lee!

29:32.120 --> 29:33.640
The cloud-pine.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.440
Maybe we can call her to this world.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.080
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

29:40.680 --> 29:42.440
She gave it to us to summon her.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.880
I beg you...

29:56.320 --> 29:57.800
...come help us.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.280
Do you think that's enough?

30:03.320 --> 30:04.720
HESTER: Let's hope so.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.400
(ECHOING GUNSHOT)

30:20.760 --> 30:23.400
- He's in trouble.
- Who?

30:23.440 --> 30:24.920
Lee Scoresby.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.840
Lee's here?

30:26.880 --> 30:28.520
I can sense that he is near.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.480
If Lee's in trouble, you have to go.
Please.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.440
He's here looking for us.

30:35.640 --> 30:38.720
We'll be safe. Just go.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.520
We'll stay here. Please, go!

30:54.000 --> 30:55.480
How far we flew.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.720
Don't you go before I do.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.400
I'm still here.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.320
We held them up.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.640
We held out.

33:31.840 --> 33:32.920
So...

33:33.960 --> 33:35.480
You're the Knife Bearer.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.720
I was told I'd find my father out here.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.760
Dad?

Will...

33:58.920 --> 34:00.160
It's really you?

34:09.600 --> 34:12.240
I thought you were dead.

34:14.160 --> 34:15.360
Your mother...

34:16.880 --> 34:19.000
Will, where is she?

34:22.120 --> 34:24.080
Will?

34:24.120 --> 34:25.480
She's safe.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.120
In our world.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.200
Why didn't you come back to us?

My son...

34:39.160 --> 34:40.720
...is the Knife Bearer.

Yeah.

(LAUGHS)

36:04.360 --> 36:06.240
- How did you do it?
- You owe me answers, Dad,

36:06.280 --> 36:08.520
not the other way round.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.760
Yeah.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.680
Do you have any idea how hard Mum found it
without you?

36:20.440 --> 36:21.840
Thinking you were dead?

36:25.880 --> 36:27.400
I couldn't get back to you.

36:28.440 --> 36:31.160
I tried everything.

36:31.200 --> 36:36.720
And in trying, I got a better
understanding of these strange worlds.

36:39.920 --> 36:44.080
An understanding that I could use
to actually help people.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.600
And you chose these people
over your family?

36:50.640 --> 36:54.560
No. I thought by helping them,
I could help you.

36:54.600 --> 36:58.400
I'm talking about the end of this tyranny,
Will, for you.

36:58.440 --> 36:59.880
For everyone.

36:59.920 --> 37:03.840
I've thought about you...every day.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.000
But, Will...

37:13.120 --> 37:15.680
...if you're the Knife Bearer,

37:15.720 --> 37:17.960
you have a task ahead of you.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.880
The fate of many worlds may rest on you.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.880
On me?

37:27.920 --> 37:30.560
There's a war coming, Will.

37:30.600 --> 37:34.840
The greatest war there ever was.
You must go to Lord Asriel

37:34.880 --> 37:39.120
and tell him that you have the only weapon
in all the universes

37:39.160 --> 37:41.760
that can destroy the Authority. All right?

37:46.440 --> 37:50.040
I don't want to. I hate it. I don't want
anything to do with any of this.

37:50.080 --> 37:51.640
You're the Knife Bearer, Will.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.280
If you don't use it against them,
they'll tear it out of your hands

37:56.320 --> 37:59.960
and they'll destroy us.
They'll have absolute power.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.440
I'm sorry, Will, but...

38:03.480 --> 38:06.320
...you must do this. You must do it.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.680
And then we go home?

38:22.560 --> 38:24.240
Then we'll go home.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.520
All right? Then we'll go home.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.960
I can't. I'm not capable.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.720
- You fought for the Knife?
- Yes.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.280
Yes. It chose you.

38:37.320 --> 38:39.720
It chose you. Argue with anything else,

38:39.760 --> 38:42.560
but don't argue with your true nature.

I'm not strong enough.

Both of us were brought here.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.960
Do you understand?

39:01.720 --> 39:04.840
You with the Knife, and me to tell you
what to do with it, Will.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.000
Will. Will? Listen to me. This...

39:07.040 --> 39:10.360
- This is your duty.
- And your duty was to be my father.

...without me.
