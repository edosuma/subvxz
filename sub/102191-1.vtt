WEBVTT

00:54.687 --> 00:56.689
[foreboding music]

01:35.461 --> 01:36.663
[birds squawk]

02:13.699 --> 02:19.205
[Abigail] Tuesday,
January 1st, 1856.

02:27.713 --> 02:29.682
Fair and very cold.

02:32.718 --> 02:34.587
This morning,

02:34.620 --> 02:37.490
ice in our bedroom
for the first time all winter.

02:47.499 --> 02:50.203
[distant shouting]

02:55.274 --> 02:58.578
[sheep bleating]

03:17.363 --> 03:18.798
[Abigail] The water froze
on the potatoes

03:18.831 --> 03:20.533
as soon as they were washed.

03:22.568 --> 03:25.772
With little pride,
and less hope,

03:26.872 --> 03:28.441
we begin the new year.

03:28.974 --> 03:31.978
[humming]

03:32.011 --> 03:33.146
[Abigail] On the porch
after sunup,

03:33.179 --> 03:35.514
I could hear the low chirping
of sparrows

03:35.547 --> 03:38.284
in the hedgerows that are
now buried in the snow.

03:48.761 --> 03:49.796
[sniffle]

03:55.000 --> 03:57.670
[utensils clinking]

03:59.505 --> 04:01.708
[fire crackling]

04:08.047 --> 04:10.683
[chickens clucking]

04:14.987 --> 04:18.391
[Abigail] Dyer has maintained
that with good health,

04:18.424 --> 04:20.059
and a level head,

04:20.092 --> 04:21.727
there is always
an excellent chance

04:21.760 --> 04:23.429
for a farmer willing to work.

04:37.009 --> 04:40.446
He feels he can never fully
rid himself of his burdens.

04:42.081 --> 04:45.584
And I'm certain that because
his mind is in such a bad state,

04:45.617 --> 04:47.453
it affects his whole system.

04:49.588 --> 04:50.623
[sniffing]

04:52.124 --> 04:53.559
[door creaking]

04:55.861 --> 04:57.797
[cows mooing]

05:15.047 --> 05:16.415
[Abigail] He told me
this morning

05:16.449 --> 05:19.719
that contentment was like
a friend he never gets to see.

05:21.019 --> 05:22.588
You're late with the milking.

05:22.621 --> 05:23.790
She wasn't suffering.

05:25.424 --> 05:26.459
And you?

05:34.633 --> 05:35.735
[crows cawing]

05:40.606 --> 05:43.909
[Abigail]Since our acquisition
of this farm,

05:43.942 --> 05:47.513
my husband had kept a ledger
to help him see the year whole.

05:49.114 --> 05:51.484
This way he knows what each crop

05:51.517 --> 05:54.587
and field pays
from year to year.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.857
And Dyer has asked me
to keep a diary of matters

05:57.890 --> 06:00.426
that might otherwise
go overlooked...

06:03.061 --> 06:06.499
From tools lent out
to bills outstanding.

06:08.467 --> 06:09.902
That I have done.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.875
But there would be no record
in these dull and simple pages

06:15.908 --> 06:17.810
of the most passionate
circumstances

06:17.843 --> 06:19.445
of our seasons past.

06:20.078 --> 06:22.448
[fire crackling]

06:22.481 --> 06:25.051
No record of our emotions
or fears.

06:26.151 --> 06:27.787
Our greatest joys.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.757
Our most piercing sorrows.

06:40.833 --> 06:43.169
With our child,

06:43.202 --> 06:45.671
it was as if I'd found
my bearings.

06:48.140 --> 06:51.077
But I too rarely told her
that she was our treasure.

06:53.712 --> 06:54.781
Would you like to try?

06:58.550 --> 06:59.886
Like this, papa?

07:02.154 --> 07:03.189
That's it.

07:05.724 --> 07:08.160
[Abigail] She often seemed
separate from us,

07:08.193 --> 07:11.831
as if she was working at
just fitting in where she could.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.035
They saw his brothers
and sisters

07:16.068 --> 07:18.037
and they were
the mouse's family...

07:19.838 --> 07:21.507
[Abigail] There is something
so affecting

07:21.540 --> 07:23.876
about mute and motionless grief
and illness

07:23.909 --> 07:25.544
in a child so young.

07:25.577 --> 07:28.881
-[coughing]
-[heavy breathing]

07:28.914 --> 07:31.717
She put her arms around me
and said nothing else.

07:36.288 --> 07:38.491
But it felt like
we were speaking.

07:50.536 --> 07:51.937
[thud]

07:51.970 --> 07:55.875
-[strained breathing]
-[soft singing]

08:05.684 --> 08:09.856
[humming]

08:37.950 --> 08:39.184
[deep sigh]

08:43.055 --> 08:44.990
[distant sobbing]

08:48.860 --> 08:51.731
[ominous music]

10:06.271 --> 10:08.374
[Abigail] I have become
my grief.

10:13.712 --> 10:16.348
I have become my grief.

10:16.381 --> 10:20.252
[church bell tolling]

10:21.720 --> 10:23.989
[Abigail] "Welcome sweet
day of rest",

10:24.022 --> 10:26.792
says the hymn.

10:26.825 --> 10:31.764
And Sunday is most welcome
for its few hours of quiet ease.

10:32.998 --> 10:34.033
As for me.

10:35.033 --> 10:36.769
I no longer attend.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.940
After the calamity
of Nellie's loss,

10:42.074 --> 10:44.143
what calm I enjoy

10:44.176 --> 10:47.680
does not derive from the notion
of a better world to come.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.719
I want to purchase an atlas.

10:55.854 --> 10:57.857
-[man 1] It could be a bother.
-[man 2] No, no. No bother.

10:59.157 --> 11:02.795
-[horses huffing]
-[wood creaking]

11:08.066 --> 11:09.068
Who is that?

11:10.001 --> 11:11.070
[Dyer] His name is Finney.

11:12.270 --> 11:15.007
-His wife Tallie.
-Hyah!

11:15.040 --> 11:16.141
[Dyer] I met them
at the feed store.

11:16.174 --> 11:17.877
They seem to keep to themselves.

11:20.378 --> 11:22.048
They're renting the Zebrun farm.

11:26.885 --> 11:29.055
[gentle music]

11:36.762 --> 11:38.431
[Abigail]Monday, February 4th.

11:40.966 --> 11:42.935
Why is ink like fire?

11:42.968 --> 11:44.369
[deep sigh]

11:44.402 --> 11:46.038
Because it is a good servant,

11:47.005 --> 11:48.507
and a hard master.

11:48.540 --> 11:49.809
[grinding]

11:54.412 --> 11:55.748
Did you say something?

11:58.083 --> 11:59.919
I want to purchase an atlas.

12:07.492 --> 12:09.928
I suppose there are more
frivolous purchases

12:09.961 --> 12:10.996
one could make.

12:17.502 --> 12:19.138
I've saved 90 cents of my own.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.373
I can't imagine a better way
to spend it.

12:25.277 --> 12:27.179
Could buy your husband a gift.

12:31.983 --> 12:33.352
What better gift
could I give him

12:33.385 --> 12:35.488
than a wife
who is no longer a dullard?

12:40.859 --> 12:41.960
[Abigail] My self-education

12:41.994 --> 12:44.997
seems the only way
to keep my unhappiness

12:45.030 --> 12:46.365
from overwhelming me.

12:52.037 --> 12:53.973
[pigs grunting]

12:58.210 --> 13:00.479
[somber music]

13:13.491 --> 13:16.862
[pigs squealing]

13:31.443 --> 13:32.444
[squelches]

13:59.037 --> 14:00.172
Good afternoon.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.211
I've been using a broom
on my porch.

14:06.244 --> 14:07.346
The snow is so dry.

14:10.348 --> 14:11.350
I'm Tallie.

14:13.351 --> 14:14.386
Abigail.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.391
I hope I'm not intruding.

14:20.091 --> 14:20.992
No.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.528
I just, I needed to get away
for the day.

14:23.561 --> 14:25.364
The farm is a slaughterhouse
right now.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.032
My husband is killing his hogs.

14:32.337 --> 14:33.505
Would you like to come in?

14:34.572 --> 14:35.875
Yes, I'd love that.

14:39.711 --> 14:42.181
Or we could just stay
out on the porch, shivering.

14:47.118 --> 14:48.420
I know it's the dullest
of all things

14:48.453 --> 14:49.988
to have an ignorant neighbor
come by

14:50.021 --> 14:51.590
and spoil a Sunday afternoon.

14:51.623 --> 14:53.458
Oh, no,
you're the most welcome here.

14:53.491 --> 14:55.961
But I know the feeling.

14:55.994 --> 14:58.630
Sometimes, I imagine during
the Widow Weldon's visits

14:58.663 --> 15:02.434
that I've been plunged up to
my eyes in a vat of the prosaic.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.102
Oh, Widow Weldon!

15:04.135 --> 15:05.704
She got going on the county
levy once...

15:05.737 --> 15:08.440
[Abigail] She saw
I had noticed her hair,

15:08.473 --> 15:11.176
and admitted she had been vain
about it as a girl.

15:11.209 --> 15:14.112
She said that back then,
she'd worn it longer

15:14.145 --> 15:17.049
and plaited in a bun
at the back of her head.

15:19.484 --> 15:22.421
In the winter sun
through the window,

15:22.454 --> 15:25.324
her skin had an underflush
of rose and violet

15:25.357 --> 15:29.161
which so disconcerted me
that I had to look away.

15:34.032 --> 15:35.167
As always,

15:36.267 --> 15:38.036
when it came to speaking

15:38.069 --> 15:41.974
and attempting to engage
another's affections,

15:42.007 --> 15:45.577
circumstances doomed me
to striving and anxiety.

15:47.412 --> 15:51.550
From my earliest youth,
I was like a pot-bound root,

15:51.583 --> 15:53.986
all curled in upon itself.

15:54.019 --> 15:56.188
I hope I'm not keeping you
from something.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.222
No.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.327
I'm glad you've come.

16:03.428 --> 16:06.031
Finney saw your husband
at the cooperage.

16:06.064 --> 16:08.467
He mentioned his new method
for farrowing his piglets.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.604
With some asperity?

16:12.637 --> 16:15.174
My husband mentions everything
with some asperity.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.311
I told him that once,

16:20.345 --> 16:21.546
and...

16:21.580 --> 16:24.082
he observed in response that
it seemed to be quite a favor

16:24.115 --> 16:25.584
to get a kind word from me.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.419
And I told him that if he
was married to himself,

16:27.452 --> 16:29.488
he'd soon find out
what a favor it was.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.156
[soft laugh]

16:31.189 --> 16:32.591
My mother always said
that having children

16:32.624 --> 16:34.126
would resolve that dilemma.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.096
My mother made the same claim.

16:39.664 --> 16:40.699
And yet...

16:41.766 --> 16:43.068
Here we are...

16:44.436 --> 16:45.771
Both childless.

16:47.672 --> 16:50.308
[fire crackling]

16:50.341 --> 16:52.578
My daughter, Nellie,
would have been five today.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.615
Oh.

16:56.648 --> 16:58.017
How did she pass?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.587
Diphtheria.

17:02.620 --> 17:03.789
Last September.

17:05.757 --> 17:07.159
I'm so sorry.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.495
[door opens]

17:14.833 --> 17:16.268
-Hello.
-Oh.

17:16.734 --> 17:17.736
Good afternoon.

17:18.436 --> 17:19.438
I'm Dyer.

17:20.738 --> 17:21.740
Tallie.

17:27.612 --> 17:29.548
Oh, it's late, isn't it?
I should be getting on.

17:31.549 --> 17:33.118
Don't go on my account.

17:33.151 --> 17:34.186
Oh, no.

17:36.554 --> 17:38.256
That's a nice wrap you have.

17:38.289 --> 17:40.092
Thank you.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.194
I never receive compliments
for my clothes.

17:44.562 --> 17:45.764
[Dyer coughing]

17:47.432 --> 17:49.234
I'm so glad you've come.

17:49.267 --> 17:50.702
Meeting you has made my day.

17:51.436 --> 17:52.438
It has?

17:53.505 --> 17:55.207
Well...

17:55.240 --> 17:58.243
How pleasant and uncommon
it is to make someone's day.

17:59.611 --> 18:02.481
Thursday, February 14th.

18:04.549 --> 18:06.618
Dyer's third night
with the fever.

18:06.651 --> 18:09.288
[heavy coughing]

18:10.522 --> 18:11.590
Drink this.

18:12.357 --> 18:14.426
[Dyer coughing]

18:28.773 --> 18:30.776
I plan on getting sick
more often.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.346
My wife smiles at me.

18:39.717 --> 18:43.355
[coughing continues]

18:43.388 --> 18:45.124
Promise me you're not gonna die.

18:46.624 --> 18:48.326
[deep breath]

18:48.359 --> 18:50.729
That would be the opposite
of my intention.

18:57.335 --> 18:58.570
[Abigail] I've restored
him somewhat

18:58.603 --> 19:00.338
with an enema of molasses,

19:00.371 --> 19:01.874
warm water and lard.

19:03.575 --> 19:06.545
Also a drop of turpentine
next to his nose.

19:09.814 --> 19:13.485
I spent the day reconsidering
my conversation with Tallie.

19:15.486 --> 19:18.256
We compared childhood beds...

19:18.289 --> 19:19.390
Mine in which the straw

19:19.424 --> 19:22.527
was always breaking up
and thinning out.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.764
And hers, which was as hard,
she claimed,

19:25.797 --> 19:27.499
as the Pharaoh's heart.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.372
[Dyer] I should be
taking care of you.

19:34.772 --> 19:35.774
I agree.

19:37.775 --> 19:39.845
[soft giggling]

19:43.681 --> 19:47.652
[Abigail] Her manner is sweet
and calm and gracious.

19:47.685 --> 19:49.588
And yet her spirits
seem to quicken

19:49.621 --> 19:52.457
at the prospect of
further conversation with me.

19:55.026 --> 19:57.362
I find that everything
I wish to tell her

19:57.395 --> 20:00.232
loses its eloquence
in her presence.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.470
So how did you come
to meet Dyer?

20:05.503 --> 20:07.405
He was the oldest son
of a neighbor.

20:07.438 --> 20:09.241
He helped out
on my father's farm.

20:10.341 --> 20:12.477
And was he instantly smitten
by you?

20:12.510 --> 20:13.812
[scoffs]

20:13.845 --> 20:14.980
He was, wasn't he?

20:15.013 --> 20:16.815
He was instantly smitten by you.

20:20.785 --> 20:25.490
He admired what he viewed
as my practical good sense.

20:25.523 --> 20:28.960
You don't countenance words
like "smitten", do you?

20:28.993 --> 20:31.296
I suspect I use
all the same words you do.

20:31.329 --> 20:33.465
I suspect you don't.

20:33.498 --> 20:35.267
In speech,
yes, because you're shy.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.002
But I bet you're more
accomplished in your writing.

20:42.674 --> 20:43.675
Thank you.

20:45.943 --> 20:49.414
Your good sense, that's all
your husband was smitten with?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.253
And my efficient habits.

20:55.386 --> 20:56.421
That's all?

20:56.954 --> 20:58.423
My handy ways.

21:02.660 --> 21:04.529
Dyer likes mechanical things.

21:06.998 --> 21:08.533
I have no doubt he would've
been happier

21:08.566 --> 21:09.968
had he been allowed to pursue

21:10.001 --> 21:12.871
the natural scientific bent
of his mind.

21:12.904 --> 21:15.040
Circumstances forced him
into farming.

21:16.674 --> 21:20.045
And despite all of that,
his heart compelled him to you?

21:23.448 --> 21:25.450
Well...

21:25.483 --> 21:28.486
You would have to ask him
about that.

21:28.519 --> 21:30.355
And what would you say
if I asked you?

21:40.565 --> 21:42.968
I suppose that as a suitor,
he was...

21:44.068 --> 21:47.038
not generous, but he was just.

21:47.071 --> 21:50.375
And that he was affectionate,
if not constant.

21:59.517 --> 22:01.453
I wasn't sure
of his suitability.

22:05.857 --> 22:08.393
But my family felt that more
improving

22:08.426 --> 22:09.494
might be in the offing.

22:11.662 --> 22:14.533
After all, it is a long lane
that has no turning.

22:20.004 --> 22:22.674
You both have much
to be thankful for.

22:25.676 --> 22:26.712
We do.

22:45.897 --> 22:47.132
It's still too soon.

22:50.802 --> 22:51.670
Sorry.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.706
[Abigail]
Tuesday, February 19th.

22:55.907 --> 22:58.677
[deep breath]

23:02.713 --> 23:06.851
My reluctance seems
to have become his shame.

23:06.884 --> 23:10.822
His nighttime pleasures,
which were never numerous,

23:10.855 --> 23:13.591
have curtailed even more.

23:13.624 --> 23:17.462
And I have so far refused
to engage his persistence

23:17.495 --> 23:19.464
on the subject of another child.

23:54.065 --> 23:55.066
[Dyer] Evening.

23:56.501 --> 23:57.836
[Tallie] This is my
husband Finney.

23:57.869 --> 23:58.903
And you already know Dyer.

23:58.936 --> 23:59.971
Our paths have crossed.

24:00.004 --> 24:02.574
And this is the Abigail
that I've been mentioning.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.642
My wife talks about you as
if you're all about the house,

24:04.675 --> 24:05.876
and everything
reminds her of you.

24:05.910 --> 24:08.913
Oh, well, it's all I can do
but sit cross-legged and morose

24:08.946 --> 24:09.981
whenever she's away.

24:11.582 --> 24:13.651
-Come in.
-Thank you.

24:13.684 --> 24:16.455
The rain so heavy
that it broke down our mill.

24:20.758 --> 24:21.793
Did you miss me?

24:23.027 --> 24:24.062
Yes.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.765
You look different.

24:28.032 --> 24:29.100
No...

24:29.133 --> 24:30.202
[soft laugh]

24:32.270 --> 24:33.839
Finney seems agreeable.

24:36.741 --> 24:38.543
Yes, he is,
when he chooses to be.

24:43.881 --> 24:45.016
[deep breath]

24:47.652 --> 24:48.920
[chuckles]

24:52.890 --> 24:55.059
[Finney] I guess I'm
supposed to offer a toast.

24:55.092 --> 24:56.327
But when it comes
to the social graces,

24:56.360 --> 24:59.297
I'm about as smooth as coming
down a rocky hill in the dark.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.032
What my husband means
is he's so happy

25:01.065 --> 25:02.200
to finally get together,

25:02.233 --> 25:03.668
and to see Dyer again.

25:05.269 --> 25:06.505
[clinking]

25:06.938 --> 25:08.006
Cheers.

25:10.074 --> 25:11.676
Part of what I value
about my wife

25:11.709 --> 25:14.112
is how she taught me to
associate with my fellow beings.

25:19.116 --> 25:21.219
Finney, that's a handsome
neck tie you've chosen.

25:21.919 --> 25:23.021
Thank you.

25:23.054 --> 25:24.189
But with my neck,

25:24.222 --> 25:26.925
my head sticks out like a
chicken in a poultry wagon.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.293
Your tart was
wonderfully savory.

25:28.326 --> 25:29.961
Oh, did you like it?
I'm so glad.

25:29.994 --> 25:31.162
I was worried I wouldn't
have enough eggs

25:31.195 --> 25:33.698
-because we had an accident.
-Oh.

25:33.731 --> 25:36.568
My hired hand pulled down a
box of eggs and broke two dozen.

25:36.601 --> 25:38.236
I announced that he was
unlucky to eggs

25:38.269 --> 25:40.171
and no longer allowed
to approach them.

25:40.204 --> 25:43.174
"Unlucky to eggs."
I like that.

25:43.207 --> 25:45.843
I told him that his shirt
had so many holes,

25:45.876 --> 25:47.612
he can make a necklace of it.

25:47.645 --> 25:50.815
Well, we often wish
we could afford a hired hand.

25:50.848 --> 25:53.084
We've suffered a great deal from
the carelessness of hired hands.

25:53.117 --> 25:55.119
Mr. Holt's hired hand is said
to have swum his horse

25:55.152 --> 25:56.921
over the canal despite the cold.

25:56.954 --> 25:57.956
Really?

25:59.090 --> 26:00.758
Yes.

26:00.791 --> 26:01.960
Winter's been so hard,

26:01.993 --> 26:03.261
sometimes Mrs. Weldon's son

26:03.294 --> 26:05.897
has had to deliver the mail
on skis.

26:05.930 --> 26:08.700
Now our letters can get lost
at breakneck speed.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.969
Did you write letters to Tallie
when you were courting?

26:12.303 --> 26:13.305
I did.

26:16.240 --> 26:17.642
And did Tallie keep them?

26:20.878 --> 26:22.347
Only Tallie knows for sure.

26:23.347 --> 26:25.617
[fire crackling]

26:30.221 --> 26:32.890
[Abigail]Monday, February 25th.

26:32.923 --> 26:34.693
-[man shouting]
-[sheep bleating]

26:44.835 --> 26:47.672
Finney and Tallie's bond
confounds me.

26:49.373 --> 26:51.242
At times, when their eyes meet,

26:51.275 --> 26:55.847
they seem yoked in opposition
to one another,

26:55.880 --> 26:59.084
while at other times,
there seems a shared regard.

27:01.452 --> 27:03.388
There is something going on
between us

27:03.421 --> 27:05.023
that I cannot unravel.

27:08.693 --> 27:09.694
Hold this here.

27:16.834 --> 27:17.869
Okay.

27:30.815 --> 27:31.816
Thank you.

27:53.170 --> 27:54.205
[door slams]

27:57.441 --> 27:58.677
Hello, Dyer.

27:59.744 --> 28:00.745
Well, hello.

28:01.312 --> 28:02.880
You're off?

28:02.913 --> 28:04.115
Yes, to town.

28:05.416 --> 28:06.818
Have a good day.

28:07.785 --> 28:09.020
She'll be pleased to see you.

28:09.820 --> 28:12.123
[cows mooing]

28:15.326 --> 28:16.327
[knocking]

28:20.030 --> 28:21.299
Happy birthday!

28:24.101 --> 28:25.403
Brought you some things.

28:29.774 --> 28:30.875
Hand-knitted?

28:31.509 --> 28:33.010
I hoped you'd like them.

28:33.043 --> 28:34.079
I do.

28:41.118 --> 28:42.153
An Atlas!

28:47.391 --> 28:49.394
The United States of America.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.433
Oh and a little pot of
apple sauce with an egg on top.

29:01.472 --> 29:03.007
My feet are freezing.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.309
Oh, let me warm them.

29:08.979 --> 29:10.348
[dog barking]

29:17.121 --> 29:18.123
How's Finney?

29:20.157 --> 29:21.159
He's Finney.

29:33.437 --> 29:34.506
Ah, it tickles.

29:40.578 --> 29:44.482
[metal clanking]

29:44.515 --> 29:47.252
My husband records
trespassers in his journals.

29:48.919 --> 29:50.488
And this morning,
when I asked him

29:50.521 --> 29:52.156
what he intends to do
about them,

29:52.189 --> 29:54.359
his response was so unpleasant
that I...

29:55.559 --> 29:57.028
resolved to visit you...

29:59.129 --> 30:00.832
so that there would be something
in my day

30:00.865 --> 30:02.200
other than his meanness.

30:06.036 --> 30:08.940
Dyer thinks he has
many estimable qualities.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.174
[Tallie] He does.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.144
And he also uses a ledger to
keep accounting of whom I visit

30:13.177 --> 30:14.345
and how long I stay.

30:14.378 --> 30:15.613
Why?

30:15.646 --> 30:17.181
I have no idea.

30:17.214 --> 30:18.616
As he's gotten more like this,

30:18.649 --> 30:20.451
I've given up trying
to figure out

30:20.484 --> 30:22.487
all the peculiarities of his...

30:24.121 --> 30:25.423
odd little world.

30:29.426 --> 30:32.463
I suppose he's especially
unhappy with me since...

30:34.498 --> 30:36.267
I'm yet to give him a child.

30:44.541 --> 30:46.077
What does it feel like?

30:48.345 --> 30:50.048
Like nothing at first.

30:51.148 --> 30:54.085
But then when she began
to stir...

30:54.118 --> 30:56.354
it's like butterflies
flapping their wings.

30:58.589 --> 31:01.125
Later, like a rabbit...

31:01.158 --> 31:03.027
when she kicked her legs
at night.

31:06.497 --> 31:07.899
It frightens me.

31:13.570 --> 31:15.373
The thought of having
none of that.

31:21.412 --> 31:22.547
And of giving birth.

31:23.614 --> 31:25.416
Most of us feel that way.

31:28.352 --> 31:29.354
But...

31:30.554 --> 31:33.925
when the time comes,
I will be there...

31:33.958 --> 31:35.226
to guide you through it.

31:44.001 --> 31:45.436
Dyer must want another child.

31:52.443 --> 31:53.478
I understand.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.681
[wind whooshing]

32:03.087 --> 32:05.556
[horse neighing]

32:27.177 --> 32:28.179
[door slams]

32:29.380 --> 32:30.448
Birthday gifts.

32:32.750 --> 32:35.320
[heavy breathing]

32:42.793 --> 32:44.329
A box of raisins.

32:45.729 --> 32:47.598
That needle case
you've been needing.

32:47.631 --> 32:49.200
And a tin of sardines.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.102
You spoil me.

32:53.737 --> 32:57.075
Oh, you got gifts
from your new friend.

33:00.544 --> 33:02.013
She left hours ago.

33:05.115 --> 33:06.284
I just saw her leave.

33:12.356 --> 33:16.227
-[wind howling]
-[horse panting]

33:16.260 --> 33:17.361
[Abigail]The great storm began

33:17.395 --> 33:20.798
with a faint groaning
in the northeast.

33:20.831 --> 33:23.668
It was like a noise
of a locomotive.

33:24.468 --> 33:26.471
[high pitched tone]

33:29.640 --> 33:32.643
[sheep bleating]

33:47.391 --> 33:51.496
[indistinct shouting]

34:00.571 --> 34:04.042
[grunting]

34:11.315 --> 34:13.317
[wind thrashing]

34:15.519 --> 34:16.788
[indistinct chatter]

34:20.390 --> 34:21.426
Help!

34:22.726 --> 34:23.728
[shouting]

34:36.673 --> 34:38.676
[foreboding music]

34:58.829 --> 35:00.631
[man 3] Come closer, girl.

35:00.664 --> 35:02.166
It's warmer over here.

35:15.179 --> 35:17.515
[striking match]

35:23.287 --> 35:25.756
I'm sorry, I'll be going.

35:25.789 --> 35:27.125
You should wait it out.

35:30.894 --> 35:32.196
[groaning]

35:36.934 --> 35:38.136
Come on, mare.

35:46.376 --> 35:48.880
[foreboding music]

36:03.360 --> 36:04.662
Dyer!

36:13.704 --> 36:14.906
Dyer!

36:25.582 --> 36:27.919
[tense music]

36:38.662 --> 36:39.964
Dyer!

36:50.641 --> 36:53.211
[wind thrashing]

37:00.050 --> 37:03.454
[Abigail]How long would it be
before I receive word of Tallie?

37:05.656 --> 37:07.225
How long could I wait?

37:10.861 --> 37:12.797
How long will the feed
in the barn last?

37:15.932 --> 37:18.769
Each cow eats 26 pounds
of forage every day.

37:19.936 --> 37:22.306
You should know that.

37:22.339 --> 37:25.843
They start to skinny down
after three days.

37:25.876 --> 37:28.679
Heard the newspaper predicts
the storm'll let up by then.

37:28.712 --> 37:29.947
But that's probably based on

37:29.980 --> 37:32.383
an expert's consultation
of a goose bone.

37:42.759 --> 37:43.960
[sighs deeply]

37:43.994 --> 37:47.465
"In a real crisis of nature,
we're all at another's mercy."

37:47.998 --> 37:49.033
Yes.

37:51.368 --> 37:52.369
My mother liked to say,

37:52.403 --> 37:55.039
"We tumble from one
mortification to another."

38:01.978 --> 38:05.049
When I was seven, an earthquake
knocked down our house and barn.

38:07.584 --> 38:08.586
Did I tell you?

38:09.586 --> 38:10.621
Never.

38:11.822 --> 38:13.557
-An earthquake?
-Yes.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.329
I remember something woke me
before dawn.

38:18.362 --> 38:19.563
I don't know what.

38:21.665 --> 38:23.000
My father was calling out.

38:25.902 --> 38:29.473
But I couldn't tear myself
away from the window.

38:29.506 --> 38:33.811
I saw birds fluttering
in the air, afraid to set down.

38:33.844 --> 38:36.380
The river was roiling,
and I couldn't move.

38:38.382 --> 38:39.417
And then...

38:44.154 --> 38:47.658
Finally, I jumped down
to our collapsed stairwell,

38:49.793 --> 38:51.695
as all my brothers
had done before me.

38:51.728 --> 38:54.065
And we all huddled together
in the dark on the porch.

39:04.474 --> 39:05.909
Later, my mother said

39:05.942 --> 39:08.746
that the dread never fully
went away after that.

39:13.450 --> 39:15.953
She said, "What was safe if
the solid earth could do that?"

39:19.189 --> 39:22.927
[deep breath]
Mother.

39:32.502 --> 39:35.906
[rapid breathing]

39:41.545 --> 39:43.147
Tallie! You're frozen!

39:48.718 --> 39:51.588
Tallie! Stay awake!
Stay awake!

39:51.621 --> 39:53.591
Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

39:55.225 --> 39:57.495
[blowing]

39:58.995 --> 39:59.997
Keep your eyes open!

40:00.864 --> 40:01.866
Keep your eyes open!

40:03.733 --> 40:04.969
Look at me.

40:07.103 --> 40:08.839
I would die without you.

40:16.079 --> 40:17.548
Then you're safe.

40:19.649 --> 40:20.885
Because I am here.

40:22.986 --> 40:25.089
[Abigail] Monday, March 17th.

40:41.271 --> 40:44.174
Half the chickens are lost.

40:44.207 --> 40:47.811
I dug ice and snow
from their dead open mouths

40:47.844 --> 40:50.481
in an attempt to revive them.

40:56.853 --> 40:59.723
[splashing]

41:23.813 --> 41:24.849
Hobnails...

41:26.149 --> 41:27.551
For better traction.

41:30.854 --> 41:32.956
[Abigail] The Widow Weldon's
son, on his rounds,

41:32.989 --> 41:36.059
reported that Tallie
had gotten home safely,

41:36.092 --> 41:38.896
with, he thought,
only a bit of frostbite.

41:38.929 --> 41:41.065
We haven't seen your friend
down the lane for a while.

41:42.098 --> 41:44.101
Finney took her to Oneonta.

41:47.871 --> 41:49.907
So everything is tedious
and lonesome?

41:51.207 --> 41:53.577
[Abigail]Thursday, April 10th.

41:54.077 --> 41:56.080
[light music]

41:57.814 --> 42:00.150
Biscuits and dried mackerel
for breakfast.

42:02.052 --> 42:04.721
Dyer has augmented
the padding in the cattle pens

42:04.754 --> 42:07.658
with his hoardings
of maple leaves and old straw.

42:09.693 --> 42:12.096
It always seems
that Tallie will never appear.

42:13.863 --> 42:16.733
But I remind myself that time
and the needle wear

42:16.766 --> 42:18.269
through the longest morning.

42:19.869 --> 42:22.206
And I have noted
that when she does arrive,

42:23.840 --> 42:27.144
my heart is like a leaf
borne over a rock

42:27.177 --> 42:29.279
by rapidly moving water.

42:29.312 --> 42:31.615
[dog barking]

42:36.219 --> 42:38.622
[dramatic music]

42:50.300 --> 42:51.368
Hello. Oh!

42:51.401 --> 42:53.303
Oh! Careful.

42:53.336 --> 42:55.372
[laughing]

42:55.405 --> 42:58.075
Stay. Sit, sit.

42:59.009 --> 43:00.077
[chuckles]

43:03.246 --> 43:04.982
[dog whines]

43:05.015 --> 43:07.818
[Abigail]Saturday, April 12th.

43:07.851 --> 43:11.188
-I spent the last two days...
-Very damp, cloudy and cool.

43:12.355 --> 43:14.024
Smoky.

43:14.057 --> 43:16.727
Perhaps the forest
is somewhere on fire.

43:19.229 --> 43:21.865
Your nose is being gracious.

43:21.898 --> 43:24.935
[Abigail] Monday, April 14th.

43:24.968 --> 43:27.704
A terribly bad spring so far,

43:27.737 --> 43:30.040
but the clover
has come up through it,

43:30.073 --> 43:31.308
and is all right.

43:33.243 --> 43:34.244
And how's Finney?

43:35.412 --> 43:36.947
The soul of patience.

43:38.314 --> 43:41.185
He's mentioning again the idea
of migrating west.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.623
You're planning on moving west?

43:46.690 --> 43:48.859
Perhaps.

43:48.892 --> 43:53.163
I had an uncle who moved to Ohio
and came to a desperate end.

43:53.196 --> 43:55.699
Which is what one
might expect from Ohio.

43:57.734 --> 43:59.837
-Tomorrow?
-Hm.

44:04.908 --> 44:07.978
[Abigail]Thursday, April 17th.

44:08.011 --> 44:11.348
Rain in torrents
nearly all night.

44:11.381 --> 44:14.918
The lane is flooded
and the ditches brim full.

44:14.951 --> 44:17.988
This morning,
only a slight shower.

44:18.021 --> 44:20.891
Tallie came later
than her usual time today.

44:22.158 --> 44:24.061
She offered no explanation.

44:25.095 --> 44:27.798
[soft music]

44:47.283 --> 44:51.855
I'm sorry that your childhood
was anything less than joyous.

44:51.888 --> 44:53.223
Joyous it was not.

44:54.390 --> 44:56.093
But I made my own happinesses.

44:59.195 --> 45:02.432
My husband says, "God
puts heavy stones in your path,

45:02.465 --> 45:04.101
it's up to us
to step over them."

45:06.836 --> 45:08.872
Stones are what
the fortunate receive.

45:10.173 --> 45:14.111
My mother's mother was born
in 1780

45:14.144 --> 45:15.979
right here in Schoharie County.

45:17.981 --> 45:20.484
I often wonder at the courage

45:20.517 --> 45:22.453
and the resourcefulness
of those women.

45:24.420 --> 45:27.390
Imagine faring forth
into a wilderness,

45:27.423 --> 45:29.960
hoping to build the foundations
of a home.

45:34.297 --> 45:37.201
Maybe they had a certain high
hopefulness that we don't have.

45:42.372 --> 45:44.041
[horse neighing in distance]

45:46.009 --> 45:47.044
When can you come?

45:48.244 --> 45:49.279
Tuesday.

45:56.085 --> 45:57.220
-Hello, Tallie!
-Good day.

45:57.253 --> 45:59.122
Was your afternoon gladsome?

45:59.155 --> 46:00.224
Yes, it was, very.

46:03.393 --> 46:05.129
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

46:10.233 --> 46:12.169
[Abigail] I felt,

46:12.202 --> 46:14.871
looking at her expression,

46:14.904 --> 46:18.809
as if she were
in full sail on a flood tide,

46:18.842 --> 46:21.278
while I bobbed
along down backwards.

46:22.145 --> 46:23.947
And yet,

46:23.980 --> 46:27.217
I never say on her countenance
the indifference

46:27.250 --> 46:30.287
of fortunate
towards the less fortunate.

46:31.354 --> 46:32.456
[sighs]

46:45.001 --> 46:46.203
[dog panting]

47:02.385 --> 47:03.387
Good day.

47:04.153 --> 47:05.222
Good day.

47:05.255 --> 47:06.256
Are you sick, too?

47:07.290 --> 47:08.325
Not at all.

47:09.459 --> 47:11.128
I was hoping to compare colds.

47:12.629 --> 47:14.031
I'll make you tea and honey?

47:40.456 --> 47:41.491
What?

47:43.960 --> 47:44.928
Every morning I wake up

47:44.961 --> 47:47.631
and I think that I never
want to be far from you.

47:58.107 --> 48:00.277
And under your influence,
since you're so good with words,

48:00.310 --> 48:01.378
I've composed a poem.

48:04.580 --> 48:07.250
It's entitled...

48:07.283 --> 48:09.286
"Oh, Sick and Miserable Heart,
Be Still."

48:17.260 --> 48:18.662
When I was a little girl,

48:18.695 --> 48:20.664
I thought I could cultivate
my intellect

48:20.697 --> 48:22.966
and do something for the world.

48:25.735 --> 48:30.307
But my life has surprised me
by being far more ordinary.

48:36.079 --> 48:37.247
You're talking about that moment

48:37.280 --> 48:41.117
that I have dreamed about,
when we're carried in triumph

48:41.150 --> 48:44.387
for having done something
wonderful or received at home

48:44.420 --> 48:47.991
with tears and shouts of joy.

48:48.024 --> 48:49.226
Do you know what I wonder?

49:00.336 --> 49:02.505
Is it possible...

49:02.538 --> 49:05.475
that such a moment hasn't
yet come for either of us?

49:08.211 --> 49:09.513
I think it has.

49:13.516 --> 49:14.651
Or that it could.

49:15.284 --> 49:16.286
You do.

49:18.388 --> 49:19.423
So what do you think?

49:21.124 --> 49:22.326
What do you think about us?

49:27.263 --> 49:29.132
I don't know how
to put it into words.

49:29.165 --> 49:30.167
Well, try.

49:32.402 --> 49:34.004
-I have tried.
-Well, try again.

49:34.037 --> 49:35.272
What do you imagine?

49:41.511 --> 49:43.179
I imagine that I love

49:43.212 --> 49:46.283
how our encircling feelings
leave nothing out...

49:48.284 --> 49:49.753
for us to want or seek.

49:54.590 --> 49:56.326
I've presumed too much.

50:06.569 --> 50:09.205
It's been my experience
that it's not always those

50:09.238 --> 50:13.410
who show the least
who actually feel the least.

50:19.148 --> 50:21.451
[scratching]

50:21.484 --> 50:23.320
Just my dog's toenails
on the wood.

50:44.407 --> 50:46.676
Why didn't you do
what you attempted to do?

50:56.853 --> 50:58.555
[soft gasp]

51:18.307 --> 51:20.410
[gentle music]

51:27.183 --> 51:28.685
I worry you'll catch my cold.

51:31.354 --> 51:33.523
You smell like a biscuit.

51:33.556 --> 51:35.225
[soft laugh]

51:41.297 --> 51:42.666
I have to go home.

52:02.618 --> 52:04.588
[Abigail]Astonishment and joy.

52:12.662 --> 52:14.798
Astonishment and joy.

52:25.208 --> 52:26.276
[sighs deeply]

52:26.309 --> 52:28.578
Astonishment and joy.

52:30.880 --> 52:34.184
[breathing deeply]

52:35.451 --> 52:37.454
[bright music]

52:49.932 --> 52:51.368
-[lock clinking]
-[door opens]

52:53.002 --> 52:55.472
You haven't accomplished
any of your responsibilities.

52:57.907 --> 53:00.911
-Do you need assistance?
-No, I don't think so.

53:14.957 --> 53:16.927
So it's a cold plate
for supper tonight?

53:27.670 --> 53:28.838
I'll milk the cows.

53:40.383 --> 53:42.586
[tranquil music]

54:06.842 --> 54:08.645
[Abigail] Friday, May 30th.

54:11.314 --> 54:13.449
The sunshine streaming
through the branches

54:13.482 --> 54:16.820
makes a tremendous farrago
of light and shade.

54:23.526 --> 54:27.430
We hold our friendship
between us and study it,

54:28.998 --> 54:32.502
as if it were the incomplete
map of our escape.

54:41.977 --> 54:43.513
When the day is done,

54:44.647 --> 54:46.082
my mind turns to her,

54:46.115 --> 54:48.451
and I think,
with a special heat,

54:50.519 --> 54:52.689
"Why are we to be separated?"

54:55.524 --> 54:57.727
[approaching footsteps]

55:15.378 --> 55:17.780
Your smile stopped.
Is it meant for someone else?

55:17.813 --> 55:19.516
Sorry, my mind was elsewhere.

55:25.054 --> 55:27.424
We need calico and buttons
and shoe thread.

55:32.762 --> 55:35.065
Am I troubling you,
sitting here with you like this?

55:36.732 --> 55:37.767
Not at all.

55:43.773 --> 55:44.907
I may be late coming to it,

55:44.940 --> 55:46.976
but I've learned
consideration of others.

55:49.979 --> 55:51.881
I've learned the need
for human sympathy

55:53.649 --> 55:55.018
and the unfulfilled want of it.

55:56.986 --> 55:58.922
I feel I've provided you
with sympathy.

56:01.891 --> 56:03.393
I suppose that's so.

56:12.067 --> 56:13.536
[sighs sharply]

56:14.870 --> 56:15.905
[knocks on door]

56:19.875 --> 56:21.010
The smile returns.

56:29.185 --> 56:30.487
[Tallie] Good day.

56:34.023 --> 56:35.024
[door slamming]

56:40.830 --> 56:41.831
[gasps]

56:43.866 --> 56:48.137
[rapid breathing]
Oh.

56:48.170 --> 56:50.440
I believe that intimacy
increases goodwill.

56:51.173 --> 56:53.443
And if that's the case,

56:53.476 --> 56:54.811
then every minute
we spend together

56:54.844 --> 56:56.746
will make us
more cheerful workers.

56:59.515 --> 57:01.084
Won't our farms benefit
from that?

57:02.551 --> 57:03.620
Won't our husbands?

57:06.856 --> 57:08.691
All our burdens
will be lightened.

57:24.707 --> 57:27.444
[humming]

57:35.084 --> 57:38.855
[Abigail] When she left,
I was like a skiff at sea

57:38.888 --> 57:41.858
with neither hand nor helm
to guide it.

57:44.693 --> 57:47.096
They're cleaning out the drain
under the street along the fork.

57:50.566 --> 57:52.569
And several people
are down with fever.

57:58.274 --> 58:01.143
Holt came by to hang the bacon.

58:01.176 --> 58:03.913
He still hasn't recovered from
being beaten by two strangers.

58:05.247 --> 58:08.618
He had to be hauled to his home
in his cart.

58:08.651 --> 58:10.553
He said the men who did it
were gonna kill him,

58:10.586 --> 58:12.989
and then realized they were
mistaken as to who he was.

58:13.022 --> 58:14.657
Lately, it seems like
all you talk about

58:14.690 --> 58:16.159
are highwaymen
and house breakers.

58:20.095 --> 58:22.131
[breathes deeply]

58:23.566 --> 58:25.268
On the contrary,

58:25.301 --> 58:27.203
I often defer
to your sensitivities.

58:29.271 --> 58:30.740
And I haven't even
told you about

58:30.773 --> 58:32.308
all the reports
in the county of men

58:32.341 --> 58:34.944
who've poisoned
and killed their wives

58:34.977 --> 58:37.113
because I haven't found it
a fitting subject for supper.

58:40.950 --> 58:43.052
[Abigail] "Killed their wives,"
he used those words?

58:43.085 --> 58:44.621
[Tallie] Mm-hm. those words.

58:46.088 --> 58:48.658
Have you had any disagreements?

58:48.691 --> 58:50.993
Yes, about my wifely duties.

58:51.026 --> 58:53.530
I told him that I was opposed
to it, that I was not willing.

58:56.265 --> 58:57.634
And he accepted that?

58:59.034 --> 59:00.937
Well, he hasn't
touched me since, so...

59:06.909 --> 59:07.977
[branch snapping]

59:12.948 --> 59:14.617
But I made myself
feel better...

59:15.951 --> 59:17.220
by composing a poem.

59:18.921 --> 59:20.323
Can I read
you the opening stanza?

59:21.857 --> 59:23.359
You can read me the entire poem.

59:23.392 --> 59:25.328
No, I'll start with
the opening stanza.

59:31.967 --> 59:33.736
"I love flowering gardens.

59:34.336 --> 59:36.639
I love creeping plants.

59:36.672 --> 59:38.841
I love walking in the air,

59:38.874 --> 59:40.643
but I fear swarming ants."

59:45.748 --> 59:47.817
I don't think I can
support the rhyme.

59:47.850 --> 59:50.887
[laughing]

59:52.921 --> 59:54.724
You see why I didn't
read the whole thing?

59:55.791 --> 59:57.193
I'm sorry.

59:57.226 --> 59:59.662
I've always been contrary
and maladroit.

1:00:05.934 --> 1:00:07.770
Earlier, I... I felt that...

1:00:10.005 --> 1:00:13.909
whenever I would draw close
to you, you would retreat,

1:00:13.942 --> 1:00:16.312
and that, if I kept still,
you would return

1:00:16.345 --> 1:00:19.248
but you'd stay at a distance,
like those sparrows

1:00:19.281 --> 1:00:22.251
that stay in the farmyard
and won't come into the house.

1:00:23.786 --> 1:00:26.822
-That's not how I feel.
-How do you feel, then?

1:00:26.855 --> 1:00:28.758
When I was in school,

1:00:28.791 --> 1:00:30.426
the teacher had me
read "Cordelia"

1:00:30.459 --> 1:00:32.028
to an older boy's "King Lear."

1:00:33.462 --> 1:00:34.363
Near the end of the play,

1:00:34.397 --> 1:00:37.400
the king and his daughter
are imprisoned,

1:00:37.433 --> 1:00:39.636
but he views it
in a positive way.

1:00:41.170 --> 1:00:43.940
"Come, let's away to prison,"
he says.

1:00:45.874 --> 1:00:49.278
"We two alone shall sing
like birds in a cage."

1:00:50.379 --> 1:00:51.414
Imprisoned...

1:00:54.016 --> 1:00:55.318
In a positive way?

1:00:56.785 --> 1:01:00.289
Well, maybe that one has to read
the entire play.

1:01:00.322 --> 1:01:02.324
It may be only in plays
where people

1:01:02.357 --> 1:01:05.294
are imprisoned
in a positive way.

1:01:05.327 --> 1:01:07.964
You don't think there's a cage
that could work to our benefit?

1:01:14.103 --> 1:01:15.204
I just...

1:01:19.842 --> 1:01:21.044
I only know that...

1:01:24.012 --> 1:01:25.448
I've never liked cages.

1:01:41.497 --> 1:01:42.965
[wood creaking]

1:01:45.267 --> 1:01:48.771
I hope you had a good afternoon
in Shangri-La or Timbuktu,

1:01:48.804 --> 1:01:49.972
wherever it is you've been.

1:01:50.005 --> 1:01:51.874
I had a busy afternoon, yes.

1:01:51.907 --> 1:01:53.175
I would think.

1:01:53.208 --> 1:01:55.211
Five hours you've been gone.

1:01:55.244 --> 1:01:56.378
I went to the drapers.

1:01:56.411 --> 1:01:58.848
I couldn't find anything
I liked.

1:01:58.881 --> 1:02:00.783
Then I stopped by the tinker
for a sack of coffee,

1:02:00.816 --> 1:02:03.419
but he's now asking 60 cents,
and I only had 50.

1:02:03.452 --> 1:02:05.387
Then I thought I would buy you
a treat of some kind,

1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:07.123
but Mr. Arnolds reminded me

1:02:07.156 --> 1:02:09.025
that I still owed
for my last transactions so...

1:02:10.926 --> 1:02:12.795
[sighs] I was forced
to close up my purse.

1:02:14.096 --> 1:02:15.297
[chuckles]

1:02:15.330 --> 1:02:17.133
Tell me everything
about your day.

1:02:17.166 --> 1:02:18.267
Don't hold anything back.

1:02:18.301 --> 1:02:21.370
You're not interested in
how your wife spends her time.

1:02:21.403 --> 1:02:23.372
I don't feel I have a wife.

1:02:23.405 --> 1:02:26.308
I feel I have a selfish whore
who...

1:02:26.341 --> 1:02:28.811
who'd rather wander off
to another man's house

1:02:28.844 --> 1:02:30.246
than contribute any labor.

1:02:35.117 --> 1:02:36.952
Well, Dyer was off
in the fields,

1:02:36.985 --> 1:02:39.155
and her house
is on the way back home, so...

1:02:41.223 --> 1:02:42.792
So it's just Abigail and you

1:02:42.825 --> 1:02:45.261
tittering and gossiping
away the hours?

1:02:45.294 --> 1:02:48.397
Enjoying each other's company.

1:02:48.430 --> 1:02:51.867
I have certain expectations,
and you have certain duties.

1:02:51.900 --> 1:02:54.837
We've talked all night and day
about your expectations.

1:02:57.239 --> 1:02:58.574
I will not stay with a woman

1:02:58.607 --> 1:03:00.876
if it continually requires
contention.

1:03:00.909 --> 1:03:03.345
Well, then you shouldn't stay
with me, should you?

1:03:03.378 --> 1:03:05.114
Don't ask for more
than you can handle.

1:03:13.889 --> 1:03:17.326
[Abigail] Sunday, June 8th.

1:03:17.359 --> 1:03:20.930
All afternoon, a hawk has been
using a single cloud above us

1:03:20.963 --> 1:03:22.832
-as its own parasol.
-[gunshot]

1:03:38.914 --> 1:03:41.083
To ward off others of its kind.

1:03:55.430 --> 1:03:59.402
[Abigail] Our whole house now
seems both angry and repentant.

1:04:03.105 --> 1:04:04.273
God help us.

1:04:10.579 --> 1:04:12.615
[owl hooting]

1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:35.204
When three days went by
without a word from her,

1:04:35.237 --> 1:04:38.340
I stole over to her house
to look on her

1:04:38.373 --> 1:04:40.109
from what I imagined to be

1:04:40.142 --> 1:04:42.211
a vantage point
of perfect safety.

1:04:50.619 --> 1:04:54.323
By turning the lens piece,
I could draw her face nearer,

1:04:54.356 --> 1:04:57.960
and hold it there
until she turned away.

1:04:57.993 --> 1:05:00.496
Her image provoked
a sensation in me

1:05:00.529 --> 1:05:03.132
like the violence
that sends a floating branch

1:05:03.165 --> 1:05:06.168
far out over
a waterfall's precipice

1:05:06.201 --> 1:05:08.137
-before it plummets.
-[glass shattering]

1:05:08.170 --> 1:05:09.571
-[door opens]
-[barking]

1:05:09.604 --> 1:05:10.606
[cocks gun]

1:05:16.078 --> 1:05:19.148
[panting]

1:05:22.017 --> 1:05:25.154
"For the wife does not have
the authority over her own body,

1:05:25.187 --> 1:05:26.221
but the husband does.

1:05:26.254 --> 1:05:27.656
Do not deprive one another,

1:05:27.689 --> 1:05:29.491
so that Satan may not tempt you

1:05:29.524 --> 1:05:31.694
because of your lack
of self-control."

1:05:31.727 --> 1:05:35.331
Ephesians 5:33. "Submit to your
own husbands, as to the Lord..."

1:05:35.364 --> 1:05:37.433
[Abigail] Monday, June 9th.

1:05:37.466 --> 1:05:40.036
[thunder rumbling]

1:05:53.615 --> 1:05:55.051
Merciful father...

1:05:56.618 --> 1:05:59.055
Turn the channel of events.

1:06:12.534 --> 1:06:15.504
Wednesday, June 11th.

1:06:19.741 --> 1:06:23.012
Dyer has been silent all day,

1:06:23.045 --> 1:06:25.514
and I was happy to be left
in my solitude.

1:06:39.728 --> 1:06:40.763
Hello!

1:06:41.830 --> 1:06:43.699
Tallie...

1:06:43.732 --> 1:06:45.234
We haven't seen you for days.

1:06:47.135 --> 1:06:48.170
Have you been ill?

1:06:50.105 --> 1:06:51.507
-Nothing serious, I hope.
-[Finney] Ho!

1:06:54.342 --> 1:06:55.411
She's been under the weather.

1:06:57.279 --> 1:07:00.215
-[Dyer] Good afternoon.
-[Tallie] Good afternoon.

1:07:00.248 --> 1:07:03.385
We want to invite you to dinner
again this Saturday next.

1:07:03.418 --> 1:07:06.355
But it's our turn.
We should be feasting you.

1:07:06.388 --> 1:07:08.290
In the meantime,
please be our guests.

1:07:09.758 --> 1:07:10.760
[Dyer] We'd love to.

1:07:11.426 --> 1:07:12.461
Six?

1:07:13.495 --> 1:07:15.097
-[Dyer] Six it is.
-Hup!

1:07:23.805 --> 1:07:25.808
[ominous music]

1:07:33.181 --> 1:07:34.817
[Abigail]My mother once told me
in a fury

1:07:34.850 --> 1:07:36.752
when I was a little girl

1:07:36.785 --> 1:07:38.687
that my father
asked nothing of her

1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:40.856
except that
she work in the garden,

1:07:40.889 --> 1:07:43.625
harvest the produce,
preserve the fruit,

1:07:43.658 --> 1:07:46.328
tend the poultry,
milk the cows,

1:07:46.361 --> 1:07:48.163
manage the household duties,

1:07:48.196 --> 1:07:50.766
and help out in the fields
when needed.

1:07:50.799 --> 1:07:52.601
She said she appeared
in his ledger

1:07:52.634 --> 1:07:55.071
only when she purchased a dress.

1:07:56.471 --> 1:07:57.807
Am I anywhere in there?

1:08:01.309 --> 1:08:04.179
I'm recording spring expenses.

1:08:04.212 --> 1:08:06.415
[Abigail] And how have
things changed?

1:08:06.448 --> 1:08:08.383
Daughters are married off
so young

1:08:08.416 --> 1:08:11.720
that everywhere you look
a slender and unwilling girl

1:08:11.753 --> 1:08:14.656
is being forced to stem
a sea of tribulations

1:08:14.689 --> 1:08:17.293
before she is even full-grown
in height.

1:08:21.229 --> 1:08:22.398
That's its purpose!

1:08:28.336 --> 1:08:32.475
[indistinct chatter]

1:08:41.550 --> 1:08:42.585
Come on. Come on.

1:08:50.525 --> 1:08:51.627
Morning.

1:09:08.843 --> 1:09:09.912
Morning, Jim.

1:09:10.745 --> 1:09:12.414
Morning, ma'am.

1:09:12.447 --> 1:09:13.649
I've got a new book for you.

1:09:13.682 --> 1:09:15.217
Do you know,
I'd actually like to see

1:09:15.250 --> 1:09:16.885
that blue dress you have there.

1:09:16.918 --> 1:09:18.187
All right, lady.

1:09:22.791 --> 1:09:23.859
[woman 1] Over here!

1:09:34.636 --> 1:09:35.804
It's two and a half.

1:09:37.806 --> 1:09:38.874
I'll take it.

1:09:46.314 --> 1:09:47.917
[baby crying]

1:09:54.923 --> 1:09:56.858
[baby crying]

1:09:56.891 --> 1:09:58.861
[shushing]

1:09:59.494 --> 1:10:00.696
[humming]

1:10:10.605 --> 1:10:11.707
My change?

1:10:17.345 --> 1:10:18.380
Thank you.

1:10:20.315 --> 1:10:22.851
[Abigail]The Mannings' oldest
daughter tipped over an oil lamp

1:10:22.884 --> 1:10:24.653
and it set the house ablaze.

1:10:24.686 --> 1:10:26.388
-[woman 2] Fire!
-[Abigail] Ho! Ho!

1:10:27.989 --> 1:10:29.391
-[man 4] Fire!
-Before she was driven

1:10:29.424 --> 1:10:31.660
from the house by the flames,

1:10:31.693 --> 1:10:33.762
she heard calls from her sister,

1:10:33.795 --> 1:10:35.798
who was trapped
in the upper loft.

1:10:36.665 --> 1:10:38.667
[foreboding music]

1:10:40.602 --> 1:10:43.372
[indistinct shouting]

1:10:46.474 --> 1:10:48.410
[Mrs. Manning cries]

1:10:48.443 --> 1:10:49.979
Get her out of there.

1:10:55.617 --> 1:10:57.552
Cassie!

1:10:57.585 --> 1:10:59.688
[indistinct chatter]

1:11:08.029 --> 1:11:09.531
Get her out!

1:11:14.102 --> 1:11:15.437
Get her out!

1:11:20.408 --> 1:11:23.879
[crying]

1:11:37.959 --> 1:11:41.463
Your wife is to be commended
on her hospitality and cooking.

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.803
I can recall the day...

1:11:47.836 --> 1:11:50.372
No, thank you.

1:11:50.405 --> 1:11:55.544
...when every family was fed,
clothed, shot, sheltered,

1:11:55.577 --> 1:11:57.779
and warmed from the products
a good wife

1:11:57.812 --> 1:11:59.715
gathered within
her own fence line.

1:12:02.016 --> 1:12:04.619
I heard down by the loggers
that Mrs. Mannings' oldest

1:12:04.652 --> 1:12:07.122
got fiercely burned
in the house fire.

1:12:07.155 --> 1:12:09.024
-Cassie.
-[Tallie] And died.

1:12:10.425 --> 1:12:12.328
[Abigail] Yes, she did.

1:12:14.496 --> 1:12:15.831
Well, as my father used to say,

1:12:17.065 --> 1:12:18.934
"The supreme disposer
of all events

1:12:18.967 --> 1:12:21.570
does sometimes disappoint
our earthly hopes."

1:12:26.975 --> 1:12:29.044
What a marvelous hanging lamp.

1:12:29.077 --> 1:12:31.046
Finney purchased it so
that everyone could read

1:12:31.079 --> 1:12:33.048
with equal ease around the room.

1:12:33.081 --> 1:12:34.917
I wasn't brought up to read
over much,

1:12:36.885 --> 1:12:39.087
but I do believe a father
should give his children

1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:41.623
every chance to improve.

1:12:41.656 --> 1:12:43.726
Children being a sore point
in this household.

1:12:46.628 --> 1:12:47.796
And yours, I'd expect.

1:12:51.733 --> 1:12:53.068
You'll have to forgive
my husband.

1:12:57.839 --> 1:13:00.008
Even so,

1:13:00.041 --> 1:13:02.110
whatever misfortunes
arrive at my doorstep,

1:13:02.143 --> 1:13:04.847
I seek to improve my lot
with my own industry.

1:13:06.514 --> 1:13:07.583
I...

1:13:09.017 --> 1:13:10.952
I study my options closely,

1:13:10.985 --> 1:13:13.989
and just attend to everything
with more vehemence.

1:13:14.022 --> 1:13:16.558
Well, then you should be
commended for that.

1:13:16.591 --> 1:13:18.059
I'll give you an example.

1:13:18.092 --> 1:13:21.062
When I first began farming,

1:13:21.095 --> 1:13:23.098
I was so vexed
at my own inability

1:13:23.131 --> 1:13:25.434
to stop my dogs barking

1:13:25.467 --> 1:13:27.836
that one January,
during a storm,

1:13:27.869 --> 1:13:31.039
I held the dog around
the corner of the barn in a gale

1:13:31.072 --> 1:13:32.474
until it froze to death.

1:13:35.977 --> 1:13:40.015
I nearly froze to death myself,
at least froze my hands,

1:13:40.048 --> 1:13:41.850
even with my heavy work gloves.

1:13:41.883 --> 1:13:43.419
That is reprehensible.

1:13:46.154 --> 1:13:48.890
[Dyer] Did I see outside
that you use an old shovel plow?

1:13:48.923 --> 1:13:51.827
Well, since you're interested
in my machinery,

1:13:53.628 --> 1:13:56.731
I have a hinged harrow
that's been giving me trouble.

1:13:56.764 --> 1:14:00.068
The spikes catch the rocks
and roots, and they break off.

1:14:00.101 --> 1:14:02.871
Well, our harrow
has upright discs.

1:14:02.904 --> 1:14:04.006
Work better?

1:14:05.006 --> 1:14:06.041
Yeah, it seems to.

1:14:09.611 --> 1:14:11.046
Bring the desserts.

1:14:11.079 --> 1:14:13.081
I think we're stuffed.

1:14:13.114 --> 1:14:14.816
My husband insists
on his pastries

1:14:14.849 --> 1:14:16.452
and preserved fruits and creams.

1:14:17.285 --> 1:14:18.520
Well, good.

1:14:20.555 --> 1:14:21.824
[plates clattering]

1:14:26.761 --> 1:14:27.863
What is happening?

1:14:27.896 --> 1:14:29.564
Are you in danger?

1:14:29.597 --> 1:14:31.266
What happened to your neck?

1:14:31.299 --> 1:14:33.502
No, I just took a fall
over a fence.

1:14:35.003 --> 1:14:36.171
I hadn't heard.

1:14:37.906 --> 1:14:39.842
There are many things about
which you haven't heard.

1:14:47.949 --> 1:14:49.017
[Abigail] Back at the table,

1:14:49.050 --> 1:14:51.487
Tallie kept strict custody
of her eyes.

1:14:52.954 --> 1:14:55.991
Her husband's mood
seemed to have darkened.

1:14:56.024 --> 1:14:58.827
He served the pastries
and creams himself,

1:15:00.862 --> 1:15:02.731
leaving only her plate empty.

1:15:19.047 --> 1:15:21.583
Saturday, June 21st.

1:15:23.117 --> 1:15:24.720
My heart a maelstrom.

1:15:25.820 --> 1:15:28.123
My head a bedlam.

1:15:28.156 --> 1:15:30.726
A whole week
and no visit from Tallie.

1:15:32.594 --> 1:15:33.629
No word.

1:15:42.937 --> 1:15:45.874
My anxieties often force me
to stop my work

1:15:45.907 --> 1:15:48.010
and pace the house
like an inmate.

1:15:49.744 --> 1:15:50.913
I have to see her.

1:15:52.347 --> 1:15:54.550
[suspenseful music]

1:16:10.264 --> 1:16:11.567
Ho, ho!

1:16:18.706 --> 1:16:20.943
[horse breathing heavy]

1:16:29.817 --> 1:16:31.853
Tallie! Tallie!

1:16:38.259 --> 1:16:39.294
[gasps]

1:17:10.224 --> 1:17:12.227
[ominous music]

1:17:20.968 --> 1:17:22.070
-[thud]
-[gasps]

1:17:23.905 --> 1:17:24.973
What has happened?

1:17:25.973 --> 1:17:27.042
They're gone.

1:17:29.477 --> 1:17:31.279
And no goodbye?

1:17:31.312 --> 1:17:32.814
We need to call the sheriff.

1:17:38.252 --> 1:17:41.690
And report what exactly?
That our neighbors moved?

1:17:41.723 --> 1:17:43.858
It's the Zebrun farm.
They were renting.

1:17:43.891 --> 1:17:44.893
I'll go then.

1:17:45.426 --> 1:17:47.028
For what reason?

1:17:47.061 --> 1:17:48.130
There's blood!

1:17:51.299 --> 1:17:52.834
And you never had an accident?

1:18:00.408 --> 1:18:01.977
So we'll just do nothing?

1:18:19.060 --> 1:18:21.063
I'll make the rounds
of the neighbors.

1:18:23.164 --> 1:18:24.766
And if we are not satisfied,

1:18:24.799 --> 1:18:26.168
we can take your fears
to the sheriff.

1:18:29.337 --> 1:18:30.338
Thank you.

1:18:34.976 --> 1:18:38.012
[Abigail] Monday, June 23rd.

1:18:38.045 --> 1:18:40.982
Dyer said Mrs. Nottoway
recalled spotting their caravan

1:18:41.015 --> 1:18:44.786
on the country road in the
late evening, heading northwest.

1:18:44.819 --> 1:18:45.854
[Dyer] Mrs. Nottoway?

1:18:45.887 --> 1:18:47.922
She believed she spied
Tallie's figure

1:18:47.955 --> 1:18:51.025
alongside her husband's
but was unsure.

1:18:51.058 --> 1:18:55.864
A hired hand, she thought,
was driving the second wagon.

1:18:55.897 --> 1:18:58.133
Sunday, June 29th

1:18:58.166 --> 1:19:00.902
I spotted the sheriff
on his way to church.

1:19:00.935 --> 1:19:04.139
I conveyed my accusations,
to no response.

1:19:06.974 --> 1:19:09.310
Dyer said that no one would
investigate a crime

1:19:09.343 --> 1:19:11.446
without evidence that a crime
had been committed.

1:19:11.479 --> 1:19:12.514
Calm myself?

1:19:12.547 --> 1:19:14.382
I refused to calm myself,

1:19:14.415 --> 1:19:17.986
so he tied me to a chair
and administered laudanum.

1:19:18.019 --> 1:19:20.989
Monday, June 30th.

1:19:21.022 --> 1:19:23.892
Bleary and short of breath
from the laudanum...

1:19:27.595 --> 1:19:29.030
I wake weeping,

1:19:29.964 --> 1:19:31.166
retire weeping,

1:19:32.266 --> 1:19:34.770
stand before my duties weeping.

1:19:37.371 --> 1:19:39.407
[ominous music]

1:19:40.241 --> 1:19:42.977
Sunday, July 6th.

1:19:43.010 --> 1:19:46.114
I am a library without books,

1:19:46.147 --> 1:19:50.285
a sea of fear,
agitation and want.

1:19:50.318 --> 1:19:54.255
Dyer speaks of how much we
have for which to be grateful.

1:19:54.288 --> 1:19:57.325
I sit violently conscious
of the ticking clock

1:19:57.358 --> 1:19:59.394
while he weeps
at what he imagines

1:19:59.427 --> 1:20:02.430
to be his own poor,
forgotten self.

1:20:02.463 --> 1:20:04.299
Wednesday, July 9th.

1:20:06.100 --> 1:20:08.203
Despite some hours
without the laudanum,

1:20:08.236 --> 1:20:10.839
I was so befogged
and wild with grief

1:20:10.872 --> 1:20:12.808
that Dyer left me
for the afternoon,

1:20:13.574 --> 1:20:16.077
unsettled and wary of my state.

1:20:20.915 --> 1:20:23.218
Tuesday, July 22nd.

1:20:32.426 --> 1:20:33.929
[horse neighing]

1:20:36.030 --> 1:20:37.833
[galloping]

1:20:39.267 --> 1:20:41.402
-Weldon?
-Good day.

1:20:41.435 --> 1:20:42.904
The renters at Zebrun's farm
are gone.

1:20:42.937 --> 1:20:44.372
Did they leave
a forwarding address?

1:20:45.573 --> 1:20:47.943
No. You've got a letter.

1:20:50.511 --> 1:20:51.580
Hyah.

1:20:56.550 --> 1:20:57.586
Is it from her?

1:21:00.121 --> 1:21:01.189
It is.

1:21:02.390 --> 1:21:04.893
-Oh.
-Origin?

1:21:04.926 --> 1:21:06.428
Onondaga County. Do you know it?

1:21:09.063 --> 1:21:10.398
It's north of Syracuse.

1:21:19.273 --> 1:21:20.375
Are you gonna read it?

1:21:22.710 --> 1:21:23.979
To myself.

1:21:38.559 --> 1:21:42.397
[Tallie]
Abigail, Abigail, Abigail.

1:21:42.430 --> 1:21:45.934
I'm sorry that all I have
to send you is this letter,

1:21:45.967 --> 1:21:49.604
and I'm sorry for all
that a letter cannot be.

1:21:51.272 --> 1:21:53.909
Even the best letter
is just a little bit of someone.

1:21:55.643 --> 1:21:58.146
I'm sorry I never got
to say goodbye,

1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:02.116
and I'm sorry that we seem
to have traded

1:22:02.149 --> 1:22:03.985
one sort of misery for another.

1:22:06.320 --> 1:22:08.690
It turns out that houses deep
in the backwoods

1:22:08.723 --> 1:22:12.661
always seem to be awful and
unnatural in their loneliness.

1:22:14.328 --> 1:22:15.663
If there were only
a ruined abbey

1:22:15.696 --> 1:22:18.967
around here with bats in it,
the view would be perfect.

1:22:21.235 --> 1:22:25.239
Our roof is ramshackle and sheds
water nicely in dry weather

1:22:25.272 --> 1:22:29.744
but we have to spread milk pans
around the floor when it rains.

1:22:29.777 --> 1:22:31.713
Still, outside the kitchen,

1:22:31.746 --> 1:22:36.184
there are already anemones
and heart's-ease,

1:22:36.217 --> 1:22:38.686
and even prettier flowers
which my stupidity

1:22:38.719 --> 1:22:42.090
keeps me from naming for you.

1:22:42.123 --> 1:22:46.027
I believe I've enjoyed myself
less these last few weeks

1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:48.396
than any other female
who ever lived.

1:22:50.498 --> 1:22:52.500
During what little time
I have to myself,

1:22:52.533 --> 1:22:55.136
Finney reads aloud
instructions for wives

1:22:55.169 --> 1:22:56.671
from the Old Testament.

1:22:59.373 --> 1:23:01.109
But when it comes to the Bible,

1:23:01.142 --> 1:23:03.444
I have to say that
there are a lot of passages

1:23:03.477 --> 1:23:05.513
he may know word for word,

1:23:05.546 --> 1:23:07.315
but which haven't touched
his heart.

1:23:09.216 --> 1:23:11.419
I can't account for his state
of mind except to say

1:23:11.452 --> 1:23:15.023
that my company must be
intensely disagreeable to him.

1:23:16.090 --> 1:23:17.292
And if that's the case,

1:23:18.125 --> 1:23:19.260
I'm sorry for it.

1:23:25.666 --> 1:23:28.136
[horse approaching]

1:23:31.472 --> 1:23:32.507
Ho...

1:23:34.175 --> 1:23:35.243
[mailman] Good afternoon!

1:23:38.112 --> 1:23:39.381
[Finney] Afternoon.

1:23:41.549 --> 1:23:42.650
Whoa.

1:23:42.683 --> 1:23:43.718
Hey.

1:23:45.352 --> 1:23:46.554
I've got something for you.

1:23:48.722 --> 1:23:49.758
There you go.

1:23:50.491 --> 1:23:51.592
Thank you.

1:23:51.625 --> 1:23:52.660
Good day.

1:23:53.394 --> 1:23:54.763
Hyah. Come on.

1:24:06.674 --> 1:24:08.777
-Is it for me?
-From Schoharie County.

1:24:12.580 --> 1:24:14.549
-Your Abigail.
-Give that to me.

1:24:14.582 --> 1:24:16.351
Give it. Finney, give...

1:24:18.652 --> 1:24:19.653
Finney!

1:24:19.687 --> 1:24:22.490
"What's to become
of the thousands of our sex

1:24:22.523 --> 1:24:24.258
scattered out in the wilderness

1:24:24.291 --> 1:24:27.095
and obliged
to tax our strengths?

1:24:27.128 --> 1:24:28.729
I feel as if,
at that selfsame hour

1:24:28.762 --> 1:24:29.797
when our prospects
were brightest,

1:24:29.830 --> 1:24:32.534
that in the dim distance
a black shadow approached.

1:24:33.467 --> 1:24:35.369
And yet still,

1:24:35.402 --> 1:24:37.705
imagine the happiest of unions
for us of the sort

1:24:37.738 --> 1:24:39.674
in which two families previously
at daggers drawn

1:24:39.707 --> 1:24:42.343
are miraculously brought
together on love's account.

1:24:47.848 --> 1:24:49.617
It is your face
I bear through the night.

1:24:49.650 --> 1:24:51.752
It is to you I devote
a dreaming space

1:24:51.785 --> 1:24:55.123
before I turn myself to sleep,
but there is no sleep.

1:24:55.156 --> 1:24:58.593
It's as if within me everything
clamors for air,

1:24:58.626 --> 1:25:00.728
and I think
if it's like this now,

1:25:00.761 --> 1:25:01.863
what will it be like later?

1:25:03.264 --> 1:25:06.501
I send you what love
and support I can.

1:25:08.202 --> 1:25:10.238
I send you all my heart's hopes.
Abigail."

1:25:21.849 --> 1:25:23.518
[sheep bleating]

1:25:35.529 --> 1:25:37.331
[Tallie] Please know
that force alone

1:25:37.364 --> 1:25:40.735
couldn't have gotten me here
to a place like this.

1:25:40.768 --> 1:25:44.872
I was told I had to act
in support of interest,

1:25:44.905 --> 1:25:49.911
happiness and the reputation
of someone I once loved.

1:25:52.313 --> 1:25:53.915
As far as I can figure,

1:25:53.948 --> 1:25:56.918
we're now still only about
85 miles apart.

1:25:58.419 --> 1:26:00.454
But of course,

1:26:00.487 --> 1:26:02.857
people like us
don't go on long visits.

1:26:04.758 --> 1:26:07.762
[ominous music]

1:26:39.293 --> 1:26:42.463
[Abigail] Dyer refused first
to permit my departure,

1:26:42.496 --> 1:26:43.932
and then to accompany me,

1:26:46.333 --> 1:26:47.534
and only caught up to the cart

1:26:47.568 --> 1:26:50.304
at the end of our property
and climbed aboard.

1:26:50.337 --> 1:26:51.372
[sighs]

1:26:53.974 --> 1:26:56.877
We were the very picture
of anguish,

1:26:56.910 --> 1:26:59.214
rattling along side by side.

1:27:00.914 --> 1:27:05.653
The night was fair and warm with
the appearance of a coming rain.

1:27:05.686 --> 1:27:06.754
A shower.

1:27:08.922 --> 1:27:10.925
[tense music]

1:27:32.713 --> 1:27:34.515
[horse whinnies]

1:27:48.629 --> 1:27:50.631
[Tallie] It's so hard
to write about

1:27:50.664 --> 1:27:52.733
how much I want to thank you,

1:27:52.766 --> 1:27:55.436
but I have to start somewhere.

1:27:56.870 --> 1:27:58.939
Abigail...

1:27:58.972 --> 1:28:04.078
I want to tell you that being
with you, even alone,

1:28:04.111 --> 1:28:07.682
has been like being a part
of the biggest

1:28:07.715 --> 1:28:12.920
and most spacious community
I could ever imagine.

1:28:12.953 --> 1:28:17.024
I feel closer to you
than I would a sister since

1:28:17.057 --> 1:28:19.394
everything amazing that I feel,

1:28:20.594 --> 1:28:22.830
I chose to feel.

1:28:25.599 --> 1:28:28.036
And do you know what memory
it is that I most cherish?

1:28:30.437 --> 1:28:34.442
It's of you turning to me
with that smile you gave me

1:28:35.843 --> 1:28:39.514
once you realized
that you were loved.

1:28:42.750 --> 1:28:45.986
I have no way of knowing
what is to come,

1:28:46.019 --> 1:28:49.590
but I do know
that all of the trust

1:28:49.623 --> 1:28:52.660
and care and courage we shared,

1:28:53.894 --> 1:28:55.663
that will all shine on us

1:28:57.030 --> 1:28:58.433
and protect us.

1:29:00.467 --> 1:29:03.738
You are my city of joy.

1:29:05.506 --> 1:29:07.809
You are my city of joy.

1:29:09.476 --> 1:29:11.512
[dramatic music]

1:29:39.573 --> 1:29:40.708
[Dyer] Whoa.

1:29:48.182 --> 1:29:49.683
[Finney] Might I ask
your business?

1:29:49.716 --> 1:29:52.486
We've come to see Tallie.
Where is she?

1:29:52.519 --> 1:29:54.789
I heard you on the road.

1:29:54.822 --> 1:29:56.957
You made such a racket.
I took you for the tin knocker.

1:29:56.990 --> 1:29:57.858
We've ridden for three days.

1:29:57.891 --> 1:29:59.126
We are not leaving
without seeing her.

1:29:59.159 --> 1:30:02.196
I'm not concerned with what you
will or will not leave without.

1:30:02.229 --> 1:30:03.631
[Dyer] Keep a civil tongue,
friend.

1:30:03.664 --> 1:30:05.533
Where is she?

1:30:05.566 --> 1:30:06.834
I treated her with tea of soot

1:30:06.867 --> 1:30:09.503
and pine-tree root
to good effect,

1:30:09.536 --> 1:30:10.871
but sickness always tests
our willingness

1:30:10.904 --> 1:30:12.774
to bow before
the greatest authority.

1:30:14.041 --> 1:30:15.976
My guess is
that it was diphtheria.

1:30:16.009 --> 1:30:17.011
No!

1:30:18.679 --> 1:30:20.514
[Finney] There is some
alienation from marital...

1:30:20.547 --> 1:30:22.683
[panting]

1:30:29.623 --> 1:30:30.792
[sobs]

1:30:53.647 --> 1:30:54.749
[sniffles]

1:31:11.932 --> 1:31:14.735
[deep breathing]

1:31:23.977 --> 1:31:26.013
[ominous music]

1:31:28.115 --> 1:31:30.051
[heavy breathing]

1:31:40.627 --> 1:31:41.762
What time is it?

1:31:44.264 --> 1:31:45.533
I don't care.

1:31:58.612 --> 1:32:01.182
-I have to go.
-You're gonna make a mark.

1:32:06.186 --> 1:32:08.523
[sobs]

1:32:09.222 --> 1:32:10.258
Come on.

1:32:11.758 --> 1:32:12.827
Come on.

1:32:15.062 --> 1:32:16.130
Come on.

1:32:27.274 --> 1:32:30.912
[church bell tolling]

1:32:37.317 --> 1:32:39.220
[baby crying]

1:32:47.127 --> 1:32:49.597
[somber music]

1:33:05.979 --> 1:33:08.683
[Abigail] Sunday, August 31st.

1:33:10.317 --> 1:33:12.253
Weather very hot and sunny.

1:33:14.321 --> 1:33:16.256
I cleaned out the shed

1:33:16.289 --> 1:33:18.793
which was full of rusty
and dusty rubbish,

1:33:19.726 --> 1:33:21.929
washed the windows,

1:33:21.962 --> 1:33:23.898
and preserved apples
for the winter.

1:33:26.933 --> 1:33:29.937
Fourteen dollars from the sale
of our milk and butter.

1:33:32.272 --> 1:33:34.675
I have cut my hand
with a paring knife.

1:33:38.078 --> 1:33:40.848
I console myself
with the conviction

1:33:40.881 --> 1:33:42.983
that someday in the future
when Dyer

1:33:43.016 --> 1:33:46.654
is forced to travel to Syracuse
for feed or supplies,

1:33:47.921 --> 1:33:49.790
I will join him,

1:33:49.823 --> 1:33:52.860
and take his rifle
and go to Skaneateles

1:33:52.893 --> 1:33:55.029
and kill Finney where he sits.

1:34:02.202 --> 1:34:04.171
Dyer has been at work
on the barn.

1:34:10.210 --> 1:34:13.414
Each day,
we enact our separation.

1:34:18.285 --> 1:34:20.988
Sometimes after it gets dark,

1:34:21.021 --> 1:34:23.991
we walk over the hills
across our upper fields

1:34:24.024 --> 1:34:25.693
for the wide, wide view.

1:34:28.228 --> 1:34:30.965
And Dyer tries to imagine us
as we were,

1:34:33.734 --> 1:34:35.469
while I try to imagine Tallie

1:34:35.502 --> 1:34:37.971
and that cordial
and accepting home

1:34:38.004 --> 1:34:40.107
that existed solely
in our dreams.

1:34:41.842 --> 1:34:44.978
I imagine Tallie and Nellie
somewhere together,

1:34:45.011 --> 1:34:47.748
and Nellie running her brush
through Tallie's hair.

1:34:49.916 --> 1:34:53.020
