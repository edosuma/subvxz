WEBVTT

00:29.655 --> 00:31.280
You keep asking me what I am.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.949
Don't you know I'm Presbyterian?

00:33.033 --> 00:34.158
Presbyterian?

00:34.243 --> 00:37.954
That's the worst thing
a jazz singer can be.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.915
Presbyterians are called
God's frozen people.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.626
Wouldn't swing if you hung them.

00:50.134 --> 00:53.594
Just a closer walk with Thee

00:53.679 --> 00:55.847
De de de boom boom

00:55.931 --> 01:00.017
Grant it, Jesus if you please

01:00.102 --> 01:01.894
Boom de boom boom boom

01:01.979 --> 01:06.774
Daily walkin' close with Thee

01:06.859 --> 01:09.694
Let it be, dear Lord

01:09.778 --> 01:11.279
Let it be

01:13.449 --> 01:17.160
I am weak but Thou art strong

01:19.288 --> 01:23.082
Jesus, keep us from all wrong

01:25.002 --> 01:29.839
I'll be satisfied as long

01:30.007 --> 01:31.507
As I walk

01:31.675 --> 01:34.677
Let me walk close to Thee

01:36.346 --> 01:40.183
Just a closer walk with Thee

01:41.935 --> 01:46.314
Say, grant it
Jesus, if you please

01:47.983 --> 01:52.737
Daily walkin' close with Thee

01:53.030 --> 01:55.698
Let it be dear Lord

01:55.783 --> 01:57.700
Let it be

01:59.119 --> 02:03.247
Say, I am weak
but Thou art strong

02:05.167 --> 02:08.586
Jesus, keep us from all wrong

02:10.881 --> 02:15.718
I'll be satisfied as long

02:15.803 --> 02:20.515
As I walk, dear Lord
close to Thee

02:21.642 --> 02:23.476
Boo boo doo boo doo doo

02:23.560 --> 02:25.436

Buh doobie do

Dear Lord

02:44.748 --> 02:47.959
Doobie doobie doobie doobie

03:02.057 --> 03:03.057
Ha ha!

03:03.392 --> 03:04.392
Whoo!

03:04.476 --> 03:05.977
Oh, yeah!

03:06.061 --> 03:09.355
Hey, guys, is this
the Venice Beach courts?

03:09.439 --> 03:12.358
You haven't put anything
in the offering plate.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.110
Oh! Sorry, man.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.153
50 be all right?

03:16.238 --> 03:17.238
I'm just kidding.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.282
Here you go.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.159
I told you he's generous.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.287
Is this where
Eddie "The King" Faroo

03:24.371 --> 03:25.830
and Duck Johnson played?

03:25.956 --> 03:28.875
King and Duck were the best.

03:29.626 --> 03:32.295
That's 'cause you never saw me.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.255
Keep singing, guys.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.883
My old man was a preacher.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.968
I love this shit.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.971
He put a dollar in.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.723
We give him a dollar's worth.

03:43.807 --> 03:51.807
Oooh, ooh, ooh

04:03.243 --> 04:10.207
Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

04:10.500 --> 04:13.753
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

04:13.837 --> 04:16.255
Ooh, ooh

04:16.339 --> 04:24.340
Ooh, ooh, ooh

04:48.121 --> 04:49.497
All right!

04:53.543 --> 04:55.127
Don't worry about it.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.130
Pass it to the little man.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.841
Let the little man get the ball.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.844
Take it to the hole, man!

05:03.929 --> 05:05.137
Let's go!

05:06.181 --> 05:07.556
Get... get... get up!

05:08.684 --> 05:10.142
Look at that.
It's all right.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.603
Walter, throw that
big fat butt at me.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.563
I'm getting tired
of making you look bad.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.150
It's hard work.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.694
I'm fittin' to dog you, punk.

05:19.778 --> 05:23.030
I'm fitting to dog you.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.658
Let me shut him up.
Give me the ball!

05:25.742 --> 05:27.785
If you shoot it,

05:27.995 --> 05:30.287
I'll knock it out
the fucking sky.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.831
Can't take it to the hole

05:32.040 --> 05:33.240
because you ain't good enough.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.458
You think so?

05:34.543 --> 05:36.711
Get some of this.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.170
Ball!

05:38.255 --> 05:40.089
You can't even dribble!

05:40.173 --> 05:41.382
Bring it! Bring it!

05:43.927 --> 05:45.678
Get that shit out of here!

05:45.762 --> 05:46.846
Ooh! Ooh!

05:46.930 --> 05:47.930
Oh! Unh!

05:48.098 --> 05:49.849
That shit went out
like a Scud missile!

05:49.933 --> 05:52.852
Oh, it hurts!
It hurts so bad!

05:52.978 --> 05:56.439
Hey, babies, I don't
mean to brag,

05:56.982 --> 05:58.065
but I'm the greatest!

05:58.150 --> 05:59.275
I am the greatest!

05:59.443 --> 06:00.443
You all right, man?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.527
Yeah.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.320
Well, get your butt up.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.032
Take your Colt-45
drinkin' ass off someplace.

06:06.825 --> 06:09.869
Aahh!

06:09.953 --> 06:11.829
Yes, Walter!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

06:12.039 --> 06:14.582
Hard goddamn work,
making you look so bad.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.126
Man, you fouled me!

06:17.502 --> 06:19.503
Foul?

06:19.588 --> 06:21.505
Just take the ball out
and shut up.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.882
What's the count?

06:22.966 --> 06:23.966
9-8, us.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.635
Get the fuck out of here!

06:26.720 --> 06:27.887
Junior, if you could count,

06:27.971 --> 06:30.056
you'd be a fucking astronaut.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.141
George, your mother's
an astronaut.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.435
He talked about your mama, man.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.188
He playing you for a punk.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.149
I wouldn't take it, man.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.569
My mother ain't no astronaut.

06:43.653 --> 06:44.653
Say it! Say it!

06:44.696 --> 06:45.696
Your mother ain't no astronaut,

06:45.781 --> 06:48.574
your father ain't no astronaut.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.744
Well, my mama
ain't no astronaut.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.079
Jump his ass, man.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.624
Me saying that
your mother's an astronaut

06:57.084 --> 06:58.250
is just another way of saying

06:58.335 --> 07:00.002
that you're
all fucked-up.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.172
Well, let's just get off mamas,

07:03.256 --> 07:05.049
'cause I just got off yours.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.550
Ow!

07:07.177 --> 07:10.262
Keep my mama out
of this, brother.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.558
She's out.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.393
Cool.

07:16.937 --> 07:17.937
She's out.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.688
Cool!

07:20.315 --> 07:22.191
She's out.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.159
What time you want me
to bring the bitch back?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.696
Yo! What's the score?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.198
9-8, us.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.242
We can't lose to you!

07:31.326 --> 07:34.286
If we lose to you,
I'm gonna kill myself.

07:34.538 --> 07:36.080
Fuck you, skinny boy!

07:36.164 --> 07:38.582
Fuck this,
you potato-sandwich-eatin' motherfucker!

07:38.667 --> 07:39.875
Fuck this!

07:39.960 --> 07:41.043
Shut up!

07:41.128 --> 07:44.046
You're giving me
Excedrin number fuckin' trillion headache!

07:44.172 --> 07:45.631
Hey, man, what's the score?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.758
Chump!
I'm talking to you.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.343
What, you deaf?

07:52.722 --> 07:53.922
I'm talking to the fucking air.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.976
My name ain't chump.
It's Billy Hoyle.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.936
Billy Hoyle?

07:59.020 --> 08:02.481
Billy Hoyle.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.732
OK, Billy,

08:03.817 --> 08:05.651
can you count to 10, Billy?

08:05.735 --> 08:06.861
Yeah.

08:06.945 --> 08:07.987
Good.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.655
What's the score, Billy?

08:10.198 --> 08:11.365
I don't know.

08:11.616 --> 08:12.908
Then you're a chump.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.828
I may be a chump,
but it's not my name.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.373
He put your ass in!

08:21.376 --> 08:22.501
Fuck you.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.087
Let's go!

08:26.506 --> 08:27.756
8-8, your ball.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.258
9-8, your ball.

08:29.384 --> 08:31.302
I don't want no excuses.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.179
I called it even.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.514
You better call a doctor!

08:35.599 --> 08:37.308
It's your ball!

08:37.392 --> 08:39.101
Sidney!

08:39.186 --> 08:40.769
Your woman calling you, man.

08:40.854 --> 08:41.854
Sidney!

08:41.938 --> 08:43.606
Your woman calling you, man.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.609
At least I got one.

08:46.693 --> 08:50.613
I seen your mother
kicking a can down the street.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.239
I said, "What you doin'?"
She said, "Movin'."

08:52.324 --> 08:53.407
Your mama's so old,

08:53.491 --> 08:55.326
she drove chariots to school.

08:56.620 --> 08:57.661
Your mama's so fat,

08:57.746 --> 08:59.747
she broke her leg
and gravy poured out.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.040
Hey, baby.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.291
Hi, honey.

09:02.626 --> 09:04.543
The check for the groceries
didn't clear,

09:04.628 --> 09:06.170
and I didn't have any cash.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.757
Sorry.
20 will do?

09:10.008 --> 09:12.009
Mm-hmm, but 30
would be better.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.469
You hustling me?

09:13.553 --> 09:16.764
You're the only one
that gets away with that.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.350
I got things working over here.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.310
Yo, man, I got to go.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.729
Daddy's got to go
back to work, man.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.314
Bye.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.483
I told your mama to act her age,

09:27.567 --> 09:28.901
and the bitch dropped dead.

09:28.985 --> 09:34.782
Your mother got a leather wig
with gray sideburns.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.243
Save your breath, man.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.411
You need all the energy
you can get.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.537
Let's go.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.081
I can't run, man.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.165
What?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.250
My bunions hurt.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.584
Get somebody to step in for me.

09:45.669 --> 09:49.296
That's all right.
You're still my hero.

09:54.469 --> 09:55.844
That's it, baby.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.974
Can anybody stand in
for Mr. Handicap here,

10:00.141 --> 10:02.184
for Mr. Motherfucking
March of Dimes?

10:02.352 --> 10:05.187
Hey, look.
Take Billy Ho here.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.398
No, man.
I don't want him.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.191
He might be good.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.193
I don't want
to go with it. No.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.278
Why not?

10:12.362 --> 10:14.738
'Cause I'm white.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.241
No difference.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.951
You could bring Bernard King in.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.244
We hittin' two, and we out.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.871
Swish! Swish!
Let's go, Billy Ho!

10:23.373 --> 10:24.665
Ha ha ha!

10:25.292 --> 10:26.417
Let's go!

10:26.751 --> 10:28.919
Ain't no need for none of that

10:29.004 --> 10:30.879
Jane Fonda geriatric bullshit.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.299
Just act like you can play.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.383
Two quick ones,

10:34.467 --> 10:36.010
bam, bam...
it's over.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.970
See ya!
Wouldn't want to be ya!

10:38.596 --> 10:39.805
You got a new teammate.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.974
Kiss your game goodbye!

10:42.142 --> 10:44.685
Maybe I should do
that shit, too.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.478
You loose?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.064
Come on out here, baby.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.441
I got it!

10:50.525 --> 10:51.859
Get out of here!

10:51.943 --> 10:53.569
Billy, I'm gonna
tell you what...

10:53.737 --> 10:54.945
Where you at, Billy?

10:56.239 --> 10:58.032
I'm gonna tell you
which way I'm going.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.327
Aahh!

11:06.916 --> 11:08.208
Where are you going with that?

11:08.293 --> 11:10.252
I got you.
I'm right here.

11:11.713 --> 11:12.921
This is my court!

11:13.590 --> 11:15.215
Oh!

11:15.383 --> 11:18.093
Yo! Look out!
Look out!

11:20.263 --> 11:22.931
- Whoo!
- Yay, Billy!

11:23.600 --> 11:25.059
Yes, baby!

11:25.143 --> 11:26.143
Luck.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.227
Pure luck.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.396
I believe the score
is 9-8, ours.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.024
Take it out.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.275
Ball in.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.778
OK, chump.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.739
The sun even shines
on a dog's ass some days.

11:38.823 --> 11:42.201
Anybody can win the lottery.
Know what I'm saying?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.790
Give it up.
Give it up.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.000
You want it back now?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.714
Whoa!

11:55.799 --> 11:57.508
Yeah, get out
of the way, sucker!

11:58.301 --> 11:59.343
Right on, man!

12:00.220 --> 12:01.220
It's over now, baby.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.847
Fuck you.
Your mother's an astronaut.

12:03.932 --> 12:07.059
My mother's too drunk
to be an astronaut.

12:07.936 --> 12:13.565
You remind me of one of them dudes
from The Brady Bunch.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.067
He looks like
the girl... Cindy.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.319
Yeah!
That's the one!

12:17.404 --> 12:18.445
The youngest one in curls.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.738
Why you laughing, man?

12:19.823 --> 12:21.573
Callin' me Brady Bunch and shit!

12:23.034 --> 12:24.076
This motherfucker's too stupid

12:24.160 --> 12:26.120
to even realize
he's being insulted.

12:26.204 --> 12:29.206
Sidney, get off the court.
You lost, brother.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.587
You might pull a couple of
passes out your ass,

12:35.797 --> 12:38.340
but that don't mean
you know how to play this game.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.551
Oh, hey, you're right, Sidney.

12:40.635 --> 12:43.554
I mean, you ain't seen me shoot.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.889
What's it worth
to you to find out?

12:46.933 --> 12:48.058
What do we got?

12:48.143 --> 12:50.352
50, 55,

12:50.520 --> 12:52.438
$62.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.441
I do detect the smell of cash.

12:56.151 --> 12:58.777
I'm gonna find out
how good you are, chump.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.280
Chump?

13:02.073 --> 13:04.366
I just have to figure out how

13:04.451 --> 13:05.784
I'm going to pull the ball
out your ass

13:05.869 --> 13:07.161
when I take your money.

13:07.829 --> 13:11.665
That is his money.
That's his money.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.667
20, 40, 41...

13:13.751 --> 13:14.793
You're short.

13:14.878 --> 13:15.878
Big Junior.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.713
Come here, man.
Loan me a 20.

13:17.839 --> 13:23.135
Do I look like Bank of America?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.579
You think I'm
gonna lose this money

13:24.596 --> 13:25.637
to this white boy here?

13:25.722 --> 13:30.350
You better not lose my money.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.311
Give me my motherfucking $20.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.475
We're gonna eat at Sizzler?

13:33.521 --> 13:35.564
Damn right!
Surf and turf.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.901
And that is his money.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.570
Let's go, baby. Best out of five...
top of the key.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.406
Since you're the foreigner,

13:44.908 --> 13:46.033
you can go first.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.660
Oh, no, thank you.
You go ahead, man.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.412
No, no.
See, this is my house.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.830
This is Sidney Deane's house.

13:51.915 --> 13:55.292
I extend my hospitality to you.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.169
That is very gracious,
Sidney Deane,

13:57.253 --> 14:01.507
but I won't take advantage of you
in your house.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.593
OK, but you might not
get another shot.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.595
All right, if you insist.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.680
That's what I thought.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.015
This is outdoor ball.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.309
It's different than
your country club shit.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.770
When you shoot,
you adjust for the wind.

14:15.146 --> 14:16.605
Out at the beach,

14:16.689 --> 14:20.651
the wind can push the ball
6 to 8 inches.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.319
You wouldn't know about that.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.321
Ha ha ha!

14:27.033 --> 14:28.242
What, you want me to move?

14:28.326 --> 14:29.493
I'm sorry.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.371
It's your shot.
Go ahead.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.375
I got to tell you,
this isn't my spot.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.210
I'll be lucky to hit 2 out of 5.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.170
I'm going to shoot it anyway.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.714
Use 'em and abuse 'em.

14:42.966 --> 14:43.966
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

14:44.008 --> 14:46.301
Oh, man!
Right off the bat.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.304
I am feeling lucky.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.140
Yes, indeed,
he wants to get paid.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.060
Show him how to put it in there.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.896
- Whoo!
- Ooh! Ooh!

14:57.981 --> 14:59.731
Ooh, it's pretty,
it's so pretty.

14:59.816 --> 15:00.857
Ha ha ha!

15:00.942 --> 15:04.486
We goin' Sizzler
we goin' Sizzler...

15:04.571 --> 15:05.654
Ah!

15:06.072 --> 15:08.115
We goin' Sizzler

15:08.866 --> 15:10.200
I never hit two in a row.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.371
Ooh!

15:14.455 --> 15:15.872
I'm very lucky.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.375
Yep, feelin' very lucky.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.836
Ugly shot, ugly shot...

15:20.920 --> 15:22.170
Look like a goddamn brick.

15:22.297 --> 15:23.964
No aesthetic beauty whatsoever.

15:24.632 --> 15:27.843
Now, mine, on the contrary...

15:28.678 --> 15:29.928
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

15:30.305 --> 15:31.972
Bbb bbb bbb!

15:32.056 --> 15:33.849
It hurts being this good!

15:34.767 --> 15:37.102
"A thing of beauty
is a joy forever..."

15:37.186 --> 15:40.522
My man John Keats said that.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.983
I never hit three in a row.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.943
I'll tell you that.

15:45.028 --> 15:46.320
I can look at you.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.156
- Oh!
- Oh!

15:50.158 --> 15:51.241
Oh!

15:52.285 --> 15:53.744
Color me lucky.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.289
Sometimes you wake up,
the birds are singing, and...

15:58.041 --> 16:00.208
That's a decent shot.
Excellent.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.045
You are the greatest, Sidney.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.171
Thank you.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.839
But I'm feeling lucky.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.218
Oh!

16:11.179 --> 16:12.220
Four in a row...

16:12.305 --> 16:14.306
This is like
the luck of the Irish,

16:14.390 --> 16:16.808
only I'm not Irish.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.477
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.520
Come on, now.

16:20.605 --> 16:23.565
I got this under control.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.650
Hey, you know something?

16:24.734 --> 16:26.652
Michael Jordan
came here one time.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.737
Took him to the hole, baby.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.322
Air Michael Jordan!

16:30.406 --> 16:32.115
I saw the whole thing.

16:32.241 --> 16:35.577
Michael said,
"You should play summer pro league."

16:35.662 --> 16:36.662
I said, "No..."

16:36.746 --> 16:37.746
Hell, no!

16:38.247 --> 16:39.367
"Shit might
mess up my game."

16:39.374 --> 16:41.458
We can't have it, Billy Ho.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.002
Shoot it.
We'll go to Sizzler.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.924
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

16:52.679 --> 16:53.929
I'll just leave it up there.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.514
Give me some, give me some.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.019
Oh! Oh, shit.

17:01.104 --> 17:03.563
Ho ho ho ho ho!

17:03.648 --> 17:06.650
It's hard goddamn work
being this good.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.484
Shut the fuck up.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.654
Rabbit ears, am I starting
to get to you?

17:10.738 --> 17:13.781
You're just making
my eardrums hurt.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.535
The thing is,
you guys look at me,

17:16.618 --> 17:20.122
you see the backwards hat,

17:20.205 --> 17:22.124
and you say,
"This guy's a chump."

17:22.250 --> 17:25.377
A fucking geek.

17:25.502 --> 17:28.213
What you don't realize is
that it ain't easy.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.716
It is "hard goddamn work"

17:30.800 --> 17:32.676
making something this pretty

17:32.844 --> 17:34.469
look like a chump.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.513
I must be doing it for a reason.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.349
You got me convinced.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.435
I miss this shot,

17:41.519 --> 17:43.019
I walk away, still a chump.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.139
Go ahead and walk away, you...

17:47.984 --> 17:49.693
You miss,
and you've been beat...

17:49.819 --> 17:52.446
well, not once but twice,

17:52.572 --> 17:55.240
by a slow, white, geeky chump.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.658
Ha ha ha ha ha.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.121
Ain't no thing.
Ain't no thing.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.373
No thing but a chicken wing
on a string.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.458
From Burger King.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.127
I noticed that wind
was kicking up a bit.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.129
You might want to
adjust about...

18:10.006 --> 18:11.381
6, 8 inches to the left.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.383
This is the big one.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.427
Don't worry, Sidney,
I've hustled

18:15.511 --> 18:18.138
a hell of a lot better
players than you before.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.349
Don't put up no brick.

18:21.434 --> 18:24.394
Stop yapping,
and let brother shoot.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.899
Yeah, I got it.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.567
It's in the wrist.

18:30.651 --> 18:31.651
Ha ha.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.653
Oh, sweet.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.200
Shit!

18:38.284 --> 18:39.659
Brick.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.453
Hey, man, give me my money!

18:41.537 --> 18:44.039
It's a money thing, brother.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.624
There's a man with integrity.

18:45.708 --> 18:46.917
Don't push your luck.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.376
Nothing to do with luck.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.337
You said we was going
to Sizzler!

18:50.421 --> 18:54.591
Shut your anorexic,
tapeworm-having,

18:54.675 --> 18:57.594
overdosed Dick Gregory
Bahamian-diet-drinking ass up!

18:57.678 --> 18:59.429
Leave me alone.

19:05.228 --> 19:07.395
Oww! I feel good

19:09.190 --> 19:10.857
I knew that I would, now

19:11.442 --> 19:13.401
Oww, I feel good

19:15.154 --> 19:16.988
I knew that I would, now

19:18.741 --> 19:20.909
So good, so good

19:21.410 --> 19:22.410
I got you

19:23.329 --> 19:25.580
Oww! I feel nice

19:27.041 --> 19:28.792
Like sugar and spice

19:30.169 --> 19:32.295
I feel nice

19:33.089 --> 19:34.965
Like sugar and spice

19:36.467 --> 19:38.927
So nice, so nice

19:39.178 --> 19:40.554
'Cause I got you

19:42.265 --> 19:43.306
Honey...

19:43.558 --> 19:44.850
I'm home.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.727
How much money
did you make today?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.563
I missed you, too.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.773
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

19:52.984 --> 19:57.028
$62, minus $5. 16
for hummus, tabouli,

19:57.113 --> 19:59.155
garden burger,
all that stuff you love...

19:59.240 --> 20:00.240
pita bread.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.701
I told you, I don't eat that
health food shit.

20:02.785 --> 20:05.036
You'll eat it and love it.

20:05.288 --> 20:08.081
OK, since you got me money.

20:09.792 --> 20:12.419
Let's see, that makes...

20:13.629 --> 20:17.716
58.84, which gives us
$806 towards the 8,000.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.428
We still owe the Stucci brothers
$7, 194.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.388
We don't give them a dime.

20:23.472 --> 20:24.639
They're holding you up.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.100
How often do we have
to go through this?

20:27.476 --> 20:28.810
There are certain things

20:28.895 --> 20:30.729
that just are the way they are.

20:30.813 --> 20:34.107
Nothing will get rid
of the Stucci brothers except $7,000.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.903
What's the deal with this?

20:38.112 --> 20:39.195
Come on, lookit.

20:39.280 --> 20:44.284
I've been studying
disasters all day,

20:44.368 --> 20:45.577
and assassinations.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.204
Come on, come on, try me.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.581
All right.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.667
Ahh. Leon Czolgosz...

20:53.336 --> 20:55.295
Who killed President McKinley?

20:55.630 --> 20:56.713
You're unbelievable.

20:56.797 --> 20:57.797
I know it. I know it.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.841
Jeopardy!
Will call today.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.846
Don't count on it,
and you won't be disappointed.

21:02.428 --> 21:06.014
The last words
of Lee Harvey Oswald...

21:06.682 --> 21:09.559
"It wasn't me,
it was the C. I... uuh!"

21:10.353 --> 21:11.519
Get it? The...

21:11.604 --> 21:13.313
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.981
I got it, I got it.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.775
Honey, honey.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.320
How much do you love me?

21:22.239 --> 21:23.823
I love you infinity.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.700
That's not enough.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.619
Infinity's the biggest
number there is.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.703
It's not.

21:28.746 --> 21:29.746
What's bigger?

21:29.830 --> 21:30.956
Infinity plus two.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.084
I love you infinity plus two.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.919
Billy, you're so stupid!

21:36.003 --> 21:38.755
You should have said
infinity plus infinity.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.799
I love you

21:41.550 --> 21:43.927
Infinity plus infinity.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.221
There's a bigger number
than that.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.681
I give up.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.100
You haven't kissed me yet.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.396
No! Take a shower.
You stink.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.647
Go ahead! You stink!

21:55.731 --> 21:56.731
All right.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.109
Wait right there.
Don't move.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.735
Hold that thought.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.989
I'll come back and put my mouth
where this money is.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.199
Ha ha ha!

22:26.178 --> 22:27.637
Billy!

22:27.722 --> 22:29.180
Somebody's at the door.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.766
Billy!

22:32.184 --> 22:34.019
Billy, somebody's at the door.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.021
Someone's at the door!
Come on!

22:36.105 --> 22:37.564
Stay calm. Stay calm.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.274
Hurry up! Hurry up!

22:42.611 --> 22:45.030
Honey, I love you, but I ain't
gettin' shot over your debt.

22:45.114 --> 22:46.281
Our debt.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.159
Whoever's fucking debt,
I ain't gettin' shot!

22:49.243 --> 22:52.662
Count to 30,
and jump out the window.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.164
Meet me on Pico.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.125
Honey, I love you.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.877
I love you, too.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.088
Who is it?

23:02.173 --> 23:03.631
It's the manager.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.050
What do you want?

23:05.134 --> 23:06.593
I got a message.

23:07.636 --> 23:09.554
Brady Bunch!

23:10.556 --> 23:12.807
1,010... 1,011...

23:12.933 --> 23:15.727
1,012... 1,013...

23:16.020 --> 23:18.104
Did somebody invite you in?

23:18.647 --> 23:19.981
Yo, I just want to talk.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.734
1,029... 30.

23:22.818 --> 23:23.818
How'd you find me?

23:23.903 --> 23:27.155
No one has ever worked me
like you did.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.908
I beat your ass fair and square.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.659
Don't cry about it.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.661
I'm not here to cry about it.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.872
I'm here on business.

23:35.956 --> 23:39.000
30 seconds.
I almost took off.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.126
Sorry.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.252
Who's this?

23:41.337 --> 23:42.337
Sidney Deane.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.797
So?

23:44.632 --> 23:46.966
Your boyfriend
took some money...

23:47.051 --> 23:48.426
I happened
to notice this bottle...

23:48.511 --> 23:50.011
Take that, I'll shoot your ass.

23:50.096 --> 23:53.348
What's up?
Baby, you need to chill.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.682
Excuse me?

23:55.601 --> 23:56.851
Holy cow.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.144
You comfortable?

23:58.229 --> 24:01.147
A futon is actually
better for your back.

24:01.357 --> 24:03.024
So, Billy, where'd you play?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.609
Some college in Louisiana.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.693
Things didn't work out.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.112
You been hustling
ever since, huh?

24:07.196 --> 24:10.031
Nobody knows me here.
I'll work the courts.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.450
I have a business proposal.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.160
It could mean more cash

24:14.245 --> 24:16.454
than this chump change.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.164
What is it?

24:18.749 --> 24:20.458
There's a two-on-two
tournament next week,

24:21.001 --> 24:22.210
sponsored by businesses.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.962
You want me to run with you?

24:24.046 --> 24:27.549
Yep. In the meantime,
we could make some change,

24:27.758 --> 24:30.426
if you don't mind hustling.

24:30.803 --> 24:31.970
What kind of hustle?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.013
Heh heh.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.640
Ball up.

24:35.724 --> 24:36.724
You ain't got shit.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.102
You ain't funny.
I'll kill you.

24:41.689 --> 24:42.730
You got me by what,

24:42.815 --> 24:44.149
7,000 pounds, man?

24:44.358 --> 24:45.567
Watch the pick.

24:47.069 --> 24:48.236
Look up, look up!

24:48.320 --> 24:49.988
Goddamn!

24:50.281 --> 24:51.322
Way to go!

24:51.407 --> 24:53.408
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.492
I tell you,

24:54.577 --> 24:58.580
it's hard work
making you look bad.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.290
Who the fuck told you to talk,
motherfucker?

25:00.374 --> 25:02.208
You score on me, talk.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.668
Shut me down, you can talk.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.670
Eat shit, shut up.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.589
You took me. Why?

25:07.673 --> 25:09.257
I let you take me to the hole.

25:09.341 --> 25:13.678
I take you anywhere,
have you for breakfast.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.221
Put up some jack.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.015
Who rattled your cage, dickhead?

25:17.099 --> 25:19.642
You talkin' a whole lot of yang.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.811
I'll pick any player here,

25:21.896 --> 25:24.022
even the worst player here,

25:24.148 --> 25:25.190
for $500.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.316
Excuse me?

25:26.400 --> 25:27.567
Scu... scu... scuse me?

25:27.735 --> 25:29.986
I'll let you pick my teammate.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.405
Motherfucker ain't serious, man.

25:32.489 --> 25:33.740
I don't believe this shit, man.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.617
Anybody.
Anybody you want.

25:35.784 --> 25:39.037
$500, baby, and you can pick
anybody out here.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.872
Anybody. Anybody.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.040
I don't believe this.

25:42.124 --> 25:45.335
Yo, Raymond,
look at the chump, man.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.337
Give him the chump.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.547
No, no, no.

25:49.632 --> 25:51.466
Hell, no. No, no.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.218
You give me a brother.

25:53.636 --> 25:54.719
You got him,

25:54.803 --> 25:56.221
the goofy-looking guy.

25:56.305 --> 25:57.305
Me?

25:57.348 --> 25:58.681
Yeah, you.

25:58.849 --> 26:00.016
I'm fucked.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.267
Hey, chump,

26:01.810 --> 26:03.394
you want to run?

26:03.479 --> 26:04.729
You mean play basketball?

26:04.980 --> 26:06.564
No. We mean ice hockey.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.025
Get your tired butt
up here, Gretzky.

26:10.110 --> 26:11.110
Where's your money?

26:11.195 --> 26:12.195
I'll get it.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.490
I got my $500.
Where's yours?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.575
I said I'll get it.

26:17.660 --> 26:18.910
I'm going to the glove
compartment.

26:18.994 --> 26:22.997
Go, and bring your Sasquatch butt
on back here.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.582
I got a hot hand.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.668
I got your back, Raymond.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.461
What's this?

26:29.338 --> 26:31.923
What the hell
is this world coming to?

26:32.508 --> 26:36.177
Look at this. I ain't got nothing
to worry about,

26:36.262 --> 26:39.347
except Cathy Rigby over here.

26:40.474 --> 26:41.849
Yo, man, where is his car, man?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.810
Is he ever going to
come on back?

26:53.779 --> 26:55.697
Hey, give me your money!

26:56.365 --> 26:57.782
Raymond, that you?

26:57.908 --> 26:59.534
No. This ain't Raymond.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.620
Take off that mask
and put down that gun.

27:02.705 --> 27:03.871
Shit.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.248
What you trying to do?

27:05.374 --> 27:08.459
I got me some chumps
on the line.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.712
Loan me some money.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.213
Get the fuck out.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.339
All right.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.301
Look, man, you need a gun.

27:16.510 --> 27:17.927
There are some crazy
motherfuckers

27:18.012 --> 27:19.292
walking around
this neighborhood,

27:19.888 --> 27:21.848
a lot crazier than me.

27:22.099 --> 27:23.558
Give me $300 for it.

27:23.684 --> 27:24.851
200.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.728
Come on, man. 275.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.062
250.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.230
All right.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.773
Now you robbing me.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.483
Jump for it...

27:32.568 --> 27:34.485
You got busted right there, man.

27:34.570 --> 27:35.903
You think you can win with him?

27:38.574 --> 27:39.991
Here we go.
Here we go.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.576
I got $250, man.
Come on.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.995
I said 500,
no-count motherfucker.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.330
250, take it or leave it.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.710
He just got out of jail.

27:50.753 --> 27:51.836
He ain't goin'
nowhere with the money.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.920
Let's do this.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.464
I'll dog you.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.509
I can make you look bad.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.636
Your mouth got you in trouble.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.597
If I was you, I'd stab myself
in the heart.

28:02.681 --> 28:06.768
Come on.
Yeah, get up.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.019
Move right.

28:08.771 --> 28:10.188
Come on, come on.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.564
That man is a chump...

28:13.609 --> 28:15.068
Sucker.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.613
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Whoo!

28:18.739 --> 28:20.782
Oh, lovely, lovely.

28:21.033 --> 28:22.233
What did you say your name is?

28:22.242 --> 28:23.242
Billy Ho.

28:23.285 --> 28:24.285
Nice to meet you.

28:25.829 --> 28:26.871
Do it.

28:26.955 --> 28:27.997
Let's go.

28:46.475 --> 28:48.518
You're slow on your feet, man.

28:49.311 --> 28:50.645
Weight slows me down.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.147
Come on.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.232
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

28:54.316 --> 28:56.734
Tim Hardaway, my ass.

28:57.111 --> 28:58.152
Get over there!

28:58.237 --> 28:59.237
Shoot! Shoot!

28:59.321 --> 29:00.321
Stay on him!

29:14.837 --> 29:16.462
Man, he traveled!

29:17.005 --> 29:18.172
Shit!

29:18.382 --> 29:20.508
Point game.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.926
That means one more point,
we win this.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.178
I understand.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.181
You going to teach class
or play?

29:27.266 --> 29:29.976
I'm taking you right
to the clinic.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.019
Class is in session again.

29:32.938 --> 29:33.938
Check.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.064
Check this.

29:35.149 --> 29:36.607
Too stupid to catch it.

29:37.151 --> 29:38.359
Yeah?

29:40.112 --> 29:41.112
Look out, look out!

29:41.196 --> 29:42.447
I'll make you eat that.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.948
Here we go, baby.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.241
You better stay off, baby.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.325
Where you at?

29:46.410 --> 29:47.452
Where you at, sucker?

29:49.621 --> 29:50.705
Shit!

29:51.165 --> 29:52.165
Aha!

29:53.250 --> 29:54.667
Give me my money!

29:54.751 --> 29:55.918
What you doin'?

29:56.170 --> 29:57.837
Hard goddamn work!

29:57.921 --> 29:58.963
Aw, come here, baby.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.089
You played a good game.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.632
These motherfuckers set us up.

30:02.551 --> 30:03.801
Hey, man!

30:03.886 --> 30:05.261
Hard goddamn work!

30:05.345 --> 30:06.512
Raymond! Raymond!

30:08.098 --> 30:09.098
Motherfucker!

30:09.183 --> 30:10.516
Raymond!

30:10.601 --> 30:12.393
You ain't gonna cut me.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.519
You set me up!

30:13.604 --> 30:15.062
Look, look, look!
Raymond!

30:15.230 --> 30:16.814
I seen you hustle!

30:16.899 --> 30:19.108
I never used no goofy white
motherfucker.

30:19.193 --> 30:20.943
Who you calling
goofy white motherfucker?

30:21.028 --> 30:22.028
You!

30:22.112 --> 30:23.237
That's cool.
That's cool.

30:23.822 --> 30:27.033
Wait a minute!
This is ridiculous, man!

30:27.117 --> 30:29.410
Look, Raymond,
we are brothers, man.

30:29.620 --> 30:33.414
I've never seen this
white boy before in my life.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.459
Sidney, you're negotiating
with a guy with a blade?

30:36.543 --> 30:38.002
You got a wife and kid!

30:38.086 --> 30:39.128
You know my name?

30:39.213 --> 30:40.880
He's talking about your family.

30:40.964 --> 30:42.006
What?

30:42.090 --> 30:43.508
Wait a minute!

30:45.093 --> 30:46.677
You talking about
my wife and kid

30:46.762 --> 30:47.845
and don't know me?

30:47.930 --> 30:49.639
Raymond, cut this motherfucker.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.266
Yo, say what?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.602
Cut that motherfucker
right there.

30:54.937 --> 30:56.103
No, no. Fuck this.

30:57.064 --> 30:58.439
Both you motherfuckers
are crazy.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.399
I'm going to my car...

31:00.484 --> 31:01.692
get my other gun,

31:02.277 --> 31:03.819
shoot everybody's ass.

31:03.904 --> 31:05.029
I'm outta here.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.447
Raymond! Raymond!

31:06.615 --> 31:07.657
Raymond!

31:08.575 --> 31:09.575
Aw, shit, man!

31:09.660 --> 31:11.035
Y'all better haul ass!

31:11.370 --> 31:12.703
Raymond!

31:13.580 --> 31:15.081
Shit. Come on!

31:15.415 --> 31:22.838
Come on!
Come on!

31:25.717 --> 31:26.759
Come on! Come on!

31:26.843 --> 31:28.219
Go! Go! Go!

31:30.347 --> 31:33.474
Whoo hoo! Hoo!

31:33.850 --> 31:37.562
Ooh! Took Raymond
to the hole, baby!

31:37.813 --> 31:38.813
Boo yaa!

31:38.897 --> 31:40.022
Whoo!

31:40.107 --> 31:42.984
You know, nobody's done that
around here since...

31:43.860 --> 31:45.570
the King and Duck Johnson.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.113
King and Duck!

31:47.197 --> 31:48.531
King and the Duck!

31:53.495 --> 31:54.579
Hey...

31:54.663 --> 31:56.163
what is this?

31:57.040 --> 31:58.124
Jimi Hendrix.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.334
I know.
Why are you playing Jimi?

32:00.419 --> 32:02.211
Because I like to listen to him.

32:02.296 --> 32:06.173
That's the problem.
Y'all listen.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.593
What am I supposed to do,
eat it?

32:08.677 --> 32:10.803
No. You're supposed
to hear it.

32:10.887 --> 32:13.431
I said I like to listen to him.

32:13.515 --> 32:16.434
There's a difference between
hearing and listening.

32:16.518 --> 32:19.854
White people can't
hear Jimi. You listen.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.732
What are you talking about?
His drummer was white.

32:22.858 --> 32:24.942
Ah ho ho ho!

32:25.527 --> 32:28.487
Get out! Jimi Hendrix'
drummer was not white.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.365
Yes, he did.
Check it out.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.867
See?

32:32.993 --> 32:34.368
This is a picture!

32:34.578 --> 32:37.121
Whole band is white
except for Jimi!

32:37.205 --> 32:38.497
This is a picture!

32:38.582 --> 32:42.335
Airbrushed! Jimi didn't have
a white rhythm section.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.837
You cannot hear Jimi!

32:45.005 --> 32:46.088
All right. Fine.

32:46.173 --> 32:48.174
All right.
Thank you.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.884
Check this out.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.596
He said I'll love you

32:53.805 --> 32:55.640
Till I die...

32:55.932 --> 32:57.183
Who is this?

32:57.309 --> 33:00.019
The greatest troubadour
of all time

33:00.103 --> 33:01.145
is who it is.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.814
Troubadour?
Sounds like a dog.

33:03.899 --> 33:05.483
That's a Labrador, man.

33:05.567 --> 33:06.859
Don't insult this music.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.027
Take this out.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.154
You're listening,
not hearing it.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.657
I don't want to listen
or hear this.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.784
This is pollution to my ears.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.787
Explain to this Gladys Knight
and the Pimps...

33:17.871 --> 33:20.206
It's Gladys Knight and the Pips!

33:20.290 --> 33:23.626
Put Jimi back in.
I don't like this.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.461
You're supposed to defend me.

33:26.088 --> 33:27.254
Who you yelling at?

33:27.422 --> 33:28.422
Get rid of that gum!

33:28.507 --> 33:29.799
I'm tired of hearing it pop!

33:31.802 --> 33:34.553
He still loved her
through it all

33:34.638 --> 33:36.931
Tell this bubblehead
to go right here.

33:37.766 --> 33:38.808
Guy could get shot

33:38.892 --> 33:40.559
playing this shit
south of the Coliseum.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.813
Let me off at the Trump Towers.

33:44.439 --> 33:45.856
Penthouse is in the back.

33:45.941 --> 33:49.110
Kept some letters by his bed...

33:49.194 --> 33:50.569
Vista View.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.196
The flyest view in the jungle.

33:53.615 --> 33:54.699
Home sweet home.

33:54.783 --> 33:55.950
You know it, baby.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.285
That was a good run today.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.913
Good run.

34:01.123 --> 34:03.374
Some of that money you made,

34:03.458 --> 34:04.500
you could take this car
to the car wash.

34:04.584 --> 34:07.378
This is one classic automobile.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.630
You got a fine woman.

34:12.134 --> 34:14.342
Keep your hands off her.

34:15.011 --> 34:17.179
I said she was fine.

34:17.264 --> 34:18.514
I didn't say I was
going to touch her.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.266
Touch her, I'll kick your ass.

34:20.350 --> 34:21.891
You hear me?

34:22.436 --> 34:24.353
Ho ho.
Ho ho ho!

34:24.438 --> 34:25.813
Looky, looky, looky.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.899
It's all starting
to come clear, isn't it?

34:28.984 --> 34:30.025
Good.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.610
You're a cool customer
on the court,

34:32.696 --> 34:35.030
real chill out on the street,

34:35.114 --> 34:37.491
can't be rattled in your game.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.828
You don't even fall
for that nigger shit.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.080
But when it comes to your woman,

34:43.165 --> 34:45.958
that's a different
matter altogether.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.835
Look at you.

34:47.918 --> 34:51.880
I ain't talked trash or pushed up
on the sister,

34:51.965 --> 34:54.884
and you already
thinking about it.

34:55.677 --> 34:56.719
Shut the fuck up.

34:56.803 --> 34:57.803
But this is good.

34:57.888 --> 35:00.848
This is really
good shit to know.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.850
I know your weakness.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.644
You like all the white boys
I ever met.

35:05.729 --> 35:08.522
You're like every brother
I ever saw.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.777
You'd rather look good
and lose than look bad and win.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.070
You don't know shit about me.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.573
I know plenty about you, Sidney.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.869
How many dinners this chain
set your family back?

35:25.457 --> 35:27.458
Just go home, get some rest.

35:27.542 --> 35:28.667
OK, Brady Bunch?

35:28.752 --> 35:30.544
I ain't tired.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.298
Bye, Gloria.

35:34.382 --> 35:35.466
Oh, goodbye.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.842
It was nice seeing you again.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.260
Oh, same here.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.513
I like these rings.
They kind of fly.

35:40.597 --> 35:41.722
Thank you!

35:42.224 --> 35:43.891
Take care.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.812
Yo, Billy, tomorrow we goin'
to 103rd street.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.772
We goin' to hustle out there.
That's Watts.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.816
Tough games out there.
Big bucks.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.359
Mm-hmm.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.987
Don't take it personally, baby.

35:57.239 --> 35:58.364
We teammates.

35:58.448 --> 36:00.032
Ebony and ivory.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.909
Ha ha ha!

36:02.035 --> 36:03.244
Hey, I got your partner.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.787
Oh, right. Fuck me.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.748
Better get your ass across La Brea
before sundown.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.333
No problem.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.091
The guy's full of shit.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.593
Here.

36:20.053 --> 36:22.805
Well, I say love

36:24.391 --> 36:26.433
Whoa, love

36:26.768 --> 36:28.185
Would somebody explain to me

36:28.270 --> 36:30.980
why this Negro is singing
cowboy music?

36:31.147 --> 36:33.190
You know this is
my favorite song.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.569
It makes me think about
making love to you.

36:36.653 --> 36:40.364
It makes me want to
lock you in a room

36:40.448 --> 36:43.284
and make love to you
over and over

36:43.368 --> 36:46.787
and over and over.

36:48.748 --> 36:49.999
I didn't say I didn't like it.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.125
Yeah?

36:52.586 --> 36:53.794
This can't be safe.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.714
You know, I believe
in safe sex, honey.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.634
For you to hurt me...

37:01.303 --> 37:02.636
I want to take a shower.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.098
Honey, no! No!

37:06.182 --> 37:07.975
No, honey! Stop!

37:08.143 --> 37:09.226
I want you to know

37:09.311 --> 37:16.275
That I was blind, but now I see

37:19.946 --> 37:24.325
I say, I once was blind

37:25.660 --> 37:30.831
But now I see

37:31.750 --> 37:33.500
Well, you know, I once

37:35.337 --> 37:36.670
Was blind

37:40.008 --> 37:42.301
But now I see

37:43.637 --> 37:50.559
That that old love
has made a fool of me

37:52.270 --> 37:53.354
Honey?

37:55.523 --> 37:58.067
My mouth is dry.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.030
Honey, I'm thirsty.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.823
Umm...

38:21.424 --> 38:22.883
There you go, honey.

38:25.095 --> 38:27.137
When I said I was thirsty,

38:27.222 --> 38:30.849
it doesn't mean
I want a glass of water.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.435
It doesn't?

38:33.645 --> 38:34.645
You're missing the whole point

38:34.729 --> 38:36.647
of me saying I'm thirsty.

38:37.190 --> 38:40.275
If I have a problem,
you're not supposed to solve it.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.319
Men always make the mistake
of thinking

38:42.404 --> 38:44.780
they can solve
a woman's problem.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.199
It makes them feel omnipotent.

38:48.576 --> 38:50.035
Omnipotent?

38:51.413 --> 38:53.414
Did you have a bad dream?

38:53.498 --> 38:55.207
It's a way
of controlling a woman.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.043
Bringing them a glass of water?

38:58.211 --> 38:59.253
Yes.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.130
I read it in a magazine.

39:01.214 --> 39:03.757
See, if I'm thirsty,

39:04.300 --> 39:06.510
I don't want a glass of water.

39:06.594 --> 39:08.262
I want you to sympathize.

39:08.638 --> 39:09.680
I want you to say,

39:09.764 --> 39:14.184
"Gloria, I, too,
know what it feels like to be thirsty.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.645
"I, too,
have had a dry mouth."

39:17.856 --> 39:19.898
I want you to connect with me

39:19.983 --> 39:21.608
through sharing
and understanding

39:21.943 --> 39:23.902
the concept of dry mouthedness.

39:26.448 --> 39:29.533
This is all
in the same magazine?

39:29.617 --> 39:31.577
You're into control.

39:31.786 --> 39:33.787
Shut up.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.998
See?

39:36.958 --> 39:38.792
You make me sick.

39:39.002 --> 39:42.129
Don't give me the rollover.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.131
When I say I'm thirsty,

39:44.174 --> 39:46.050
it means if anybody
has a glass of water,

39:46.134 --> 39:47.551
I'd love a sip.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.219
When I say I want to make love,

39:49.304 --> 39:50.679
it means, let's screw.

39:51.347 --> 39:54.183
Exactly the kind of thing
I thought you'd say!

39:54.476 --> 39:57.186
I don't like
the word "screw," OK?

39:57.312 --> 39:59.730
I prefer "make love"
or "fuck."

40:00.565 --> 40:03.025
Screwing is for carpenters.

40:06.279 --> 40:07.988
Oh, you're going to get it.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.490
Oh, honey.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.366
Ohh!

40:12.577 --> 40:13.577
Where you going?

40:13.661 --> 40:14.703
Anywhere...

40:14.788 --> 40:16.538
to get the hell away from you.

40:16.831 --> 40:19.583
Psycho, chiquita nut case.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.961
Oh, come back!
I want to make love!

40:23.338 --> 40:25.756
Honey, come back!
I want to screw!

40:27.842 --> 40:30.177
Ah. Forget you, then.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.304
Piece of shit.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.515
Asshole.

40:43.233 --> 40:44.691
Look! There he is.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.115
Honey!

40:51.199 --> 40:52.199
The Stuccis!

40:52.283 --> 40:53.283
The Stuccis?

40:53.368 --> 40:54.368
Oh!

40:54.410 --> 40:55.452
Honey, hurry!

40:55.537 --> 40:57.329
How did they find us?

40:58.706 --> 40:59.915
The money!

41:00.542 --> 41:01.834
All right!
All right!

41:01.918 --> 41:03.198
I got the money!
I got the money!

41:04.212 --> 41:05.712
OK, OK.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.924
If you wanna try the front door

41:09.509 --> 41:12.219
That's a door I've never seen

41:17.308 --> 41:18.517
Go, honey! Come on!

41:18.601 --> 41:19.810
I'm coming, honey!

41:19.894 --> 41:23.272
Go! Come on!
Go! Go! Go!

41:23.439 --> 41:25.399
Slow up!
Slow up!

41:27.902 --> 41:29.570
Wait for me!
Wait for me!

41:31.030 --> 41:32.270
How come you're moving so slow?

41:32.323 --> 41:33.740
I'm carrying everything.

41:34.617 --> 41:36.243
You want me to carry you, too?

41:36.911 --> 41:38.078
Oh, shit!

41:39.080 --> 41:40.831
Come on!

41:41.207 --> 41:43.125
Come on, honey!

41:44.752 --> 41:46.003
We'd shoot you, Billy,

41:46.087 --> 41:47.754
But first we want the money!

41:48.089 --> 41:51.049
We've got your number
now, Billy.

41:51.426 --> 41:55.262
Get in my limo, baby

41:55.638 --> 41:59.099
Gonna take you for a ride

42:00.185 --> 42:02.769
And I tell you I'm a rich man

42:03.479 --> 42:05.856
Then you tell me that I lie

42:05.940 --> 42:06.940
Hurry up!

42:07.025 --> 42:08.400
Go! Go! Go!

42:11.863 --> 42:12.863
Blueberry

42:12.947 --> 42:14.031
Tonga Sherry

42:14.115 --> 42:15.991
Evie lvy over

42:16.075 --> 42:18.285
Mama's in the kitchen
cookin' rock

42:18.369 --> 42:20.245
Daddy's outside shooting duck

42:20.330 --> 42:22.206
Baby in the cradle fast asleep

42:22.290 --> 42:24.333
And here comes sister
with the hlt...

42:26.794 --> 42:28.128
This is a great house,

42:28.421 --> 42:29.796
great house.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.925
But the number's a little steep
right now.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.344
Sidney, we got to talk.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.430
Excuse me.

42:38.514 --> 42:39.556
Jack be quick

42:39.641 --> 42:41.391
Jack jump over the candlestick

42:42.894 --> 42:44.686
Baby, I want this house.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.605
Baby, I know.
I want the house, too,

42:46.689 --> 42:47.898
but it's expensive.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.067
They want first, last, damages.

42:50.151 --> 42:51.485
I'll get a job.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.404
No, no, baby.
I got lots of jobs...

42:54.489 --> 42:58.825
The cable thing, the roof thing,
the paint thing.

42:59.160 --> 43:00.994
Construction is a little slow,

43:01.079 --> 43:03.413
but basketball is
putting food on the table.

43:03.498 --> 43:05.165
Basketball isn't a real job.

43:05.250 --> 43:08.126
I got to go.

43:08.253 --> 43:09.503
I'm working on this new shot.

43:09.671 --> 43:11.505
I'm sure it's a gorgeous shot,

43:12.966 --> 43:16.009
but I still want this house.

43:16.678 --> 43:17.678
OK?

43:17.762 --> 43:18.804
OK.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.722
OK?

43:21.266 --> 43:23.934
213

43:24.018 --> 43:25.686
Gotta give 'em what they need

43:25.770 --> 43:26.937
Area code

43:29.399 --> 43:32.401
213

43:32.485 --> 43:33.527
Oh, yeah

43:33.611 --> 43:35.362
Area code

43:42.704 --> 43:43.787
Pass the ball!

43:43.871 --> 43:45.122
Foul! Foul!

43:45.206 --> 43:49.209
No! All ball!
No foul!

43:49.836 --> 43:52.004
No. Your hand is
part of the ball.

43:52.088 --> 43:53.755
The wrist is a part of the hand.

43:54.007 --> 43:55.882
Knee bone's connected
to the dick bone.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.384
You fouled Robert.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.553
You didn't see the play!

43:59.762 --> 44:02.222
You couldn't carry my jockstrap
in a suitcase.

44:02.307 --> 44:04.850
I thought this was Watts.

44:04.934 --> 44:06.518
Thought you had
some ballplayers here.

44:06.602 --> 44:08.562
This ain't jack shit!

44:08.896 --> 44:10.981
I'm tired of looking at you.

44:11.316 --> 44:13.358
Your mother threw you out
at an early age.

44:13.443 --> 44:14.901
Talking about your mama.

44:14.986 --> 44:17.779
Nobody talks about my mother.

44:17.864 --> 44:19.740
Don't ever talk about my mama.

44:19.824 --> 44:22.159
Me and any guy here
will take you.

44:22.285 --> 44:23.618
How much you want to roll?

44:23.786 --> 44:25.245
Oh, my God!

44:25.371 --> 44:26.788
Oh! What is this?

44:28.207 --> 44:30.876
Oh! Look at this!
It's $1,000!

44:30.960 --> 44:33.462
There could be more.
Hold on.

44:33.546 --> 44:35.589
Hold on a second.

44:35.882 --> 44:36.965
Did you rob
a 7-Eleven?

44:37.050 --> 44:38.592
11, 12, 13.

44:39.427 --> 44:40.635
Is there some more?

44:40.762 --> 44:42.679
14, 15, honey.

44:43.264 --> 44:44.306
Your rent money?

44:44.390 --> 44:45.599
16!

44:45.850 --> 44:47.309
Ooh!

44:47.435 --> 44:49.603
It's coming from everywhere.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.521
17! $1,700, baby.

44:51.606 --> 44:54.066
We get to pick your partner.

44:54.150 --> 44:55.692
Pick any of these stiffs here.

44:55.777 --> 44:57.486
Anybody. $1,700.

44:58.279 --> 45:00.280
Don't talk about my mother.

45:01.657 --> 45:02.657
How about right here?

45:02.742 --> 45:04.326
No, no, no, no.

45:04.786 --> 45:05.952
I want that guy.

45:06.162 --> 45:08.080
The white boy
getting off the train?

45:08.164 --> 45:09.706
That scraggly-looking
one.

45:10.416 --> 45:13.585
Ha ha ha ha!

45:15.254 --> 45:17.839
No, no, no, no.
Fuck that.

45:17.924 --> 45:18.924
Wait a minute.

45:19.008 --> 45:21.218
I got 800.
Just cashed my rent check.

45:21.302 --> 45:22.761
I got 50 bucks.

45:22.929 --> 45:26.139
Come up with 1,700,
or take a walk.

45:26.224 --> 45:27.557
Play us for what we got.

45:27.642 --> 45:29.893
Play a tune on your bald head.

45:29.977 --> 45:31.353
Hold on.

45:33.481 --> 45:34.898
Sweetheart, how you doing?

45:34.982 --> 45:36.024
What's up?

45:36.192 --> 45:37.651
You look so good.

45:37.735 --> 45:38.777
What's up, baby?

45:39.112 --> 45:40.153
I need the diamond.

45:40.947 --> 45:44.658
I told you he was no good.

45:44.742 --> 45:45.742
You gave me this for Christmas.

45:45.827 --> 45:49.287
I'll give you two.

45:49.372 --> 45:50.831
We'll go to Zales after this.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.416
- Do you listen to me?
- No.

45:52.500 --> 45:54.000
He's a dog! D-O-G!

45:54.127 --> 45:56.628
This ain't no diamond!
This is a zircon!

45:57.588 --> 45:58.588
I'll tell you what.

45:58.673 --> 46:01.675
This shit here is
worth 300 bills, right?

46:01.759 --> 46:04.970
I'll put my 1,700
against your 1, 150.

46:05.054 --> 46:06.304
That's a bet!

46:06.389 --> 46:07.431
I'll hold the money.

46:07.515 --> 46:10.892
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

46:11.018 --> 46:12.853
I'll hold it.
I ain't going nowhere.

46:13.396 --> 46:15.814
He ain't going nowhere.
The bakery ain't open yet.

46:15.982 --> 46:18.150
We play to 10 by 1 s.
You make it, you take it.

46:21.737 --> 46:24.030
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Martha Graham!

46:24.282 --> 46:26.575
Martha Graham, can you play?

46:26.909 --> 46:30.120
Can you come out and play?

46:31.164 --> 46:35.083
Do you think you can play?

46:35.376 --> 46:38.211
Can you come out and play?

46:39.464 --> 46:42.174
Do you think you can play?

46:42.258 --> 46:43.717
I got it!

46:44.635 --> 46:46.136
Call out the screen!

46:46.220 --> 46:47.345
Nice pick, man.

46:47.430 --> 46:48.805
Damn! Switch, man!

46:48.890 --> 46:50.807
Switch, my ass!

46:51.684 --> 46:53.477
OK.
Right here.

46:56.189 --> 46:57.606
Do it here!

46:58.232 --> 46:59.524
I got it!

47:00.735 --> 47:03.570
Can you come out and play?

47:04.822 --> 47:07.199
Do you think you can play?

47:08.576 --> 47:09.618
Whoo! Yes!

47:09.702 --> 47:11.703
Yes!

47:11.787 --> 47:13.163
Go back to Sea World,
motherfucker.

47:13.247 --> 47:14.873
You let him back door you
like that?

47:14.957 --> 47:16.833
I thought he was going to pass
the ball.

47:20.463 --> 47:21.838
"D" up, man.

47:22.006 --> 47:23.590
You don't know what "D" is.

47:23.674 --> 47:24.841
No, shit, Curly.

47:25.259 --> 47:26.801
You fucking Globetrotter.
Come on.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.305
Come on! Come on!

47:32.099 --> 47:33.725
Come on, man!

47:34.393 --> 47:36.311
Can you come out and play?

47:36.395 --> 47:38.522
Hey, hey

47:38.606 --> 47:41.107
Do you think you can play?

47:42.693 --> 47:45.529
Can you come out and play?

47:46.447 --> 47:48.406
Were you going to shoot?

47:48.616 --> 47:49.991
He was on my ass.

47:50.076 --> 47:51.451
You were wide-open.

47:51.536 --> 47:52.661
$1,700 is on the line.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.496
I'm not forcing the shot.

47:55.456 --> 47:59.125
Do you think you can play?

47:59.669 --> 48:01.795
Can you come out and play?

48:01.879 --> 48:03.713
Yes, baby!

48:04.882 --> 48:06.132
Why are you kicking out to me?

48:06.217 --> 48:07.384
Take the shot.

48:07.468 --> 48:08.468
I'm sorry, man.

48:08.553 --> 48:09.553
You OK?

48:09.637 --> 48:10.637
Yeah.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.474
9-8, us, point game!
Check the ball.

48:14.600 --> 48:17.102
One more bucket,
me and Zeke split $1,700.

48:17.186 --> 48:18.520
No.

48:19.272 --> 48:21.648
You tried to hustle.
Still wasn't good enough.

48:21.774 --> 48:23.858
Are we going to
chitchat or play?

48:23.943 --> 48:25.527
Get the fuck out!

48:25.653 --> 48:29.114
Take me to the hole, then.

48:29.198 --> 48:30.574
Let's go!

48:30.658 --> 48:32.033
I practice on people like you.

48:32.118 --> 48:33.577
Practice playing this game.

48:33.661 --> 48:34.953
Ball! Ball!
Ball! Ball!

48:36.038 --> 48:37.831
I'm going to take your money,
then your girl.

48:37.957 --> 48:40.166
Take your old girl.

48:41.836 --> 48:42.836
You're holding me!

48:42.920 --> 48:43.920
I ain't holding you!

48:44.005 --> 48:45.130
That's all you're doing.

48:45.673 --> 48:47.090
Hey!
Get this jump!

48:48.342 --> 48:49.384
Oh!

48:49.468 --> 48:50.594
Yes!

48:50.678 --> 48:52.470
Both of y'all go
back to Sea World!

48:52.555 --> 48:54.723
- 1,700!
- 1,700!

48:55.850 --> 48:56.891
Hey!

48:58.185 --> 48:59.477
Goddamn!

49:00.855 --> 49:01.896
Give me my money.

49:01.981 --> 49:03.857
It was so nice just to hold it.

49:05.860 --> 49:07.569
I am dead.
I am dead.

49:08.529 --> 49:10.071
Oh, man.
I'm sorry, man.

49:10.156 --> 49:11.448
I thought I had it.

49:11.616 --> 49:14.534
I'm dog meat.
She'll dump me now.

49:15.703 --> 49:18.330
I feel terrible.
I had a lousy game.

49:19.457 --> 49:21.124
Shit! We're better
than those guys!

49:21.208 --> 49:23.376
I've beat guys
10 times better than that!

49:23.961 --> 49:26.504
I know.
It's my fault.

49:26.589 --> 49:27.631
It's nobody's fault.

49:27.715 --> 49:29.633
Sometimes the ball
doesn't go down.

49:30.635 --> 49:31.801
Look, man.
You want a ride?

49:31.886 --> 49:33.386
I'm taking the rail.

49:35.056 --> 49:39.225
I got to figure out how I'm going
to tell Gloria

49:39.310 --> 49:41.061
I lost everything we had again,

49:41.145 --> 49:44.356
then figure out where
I'm going to sleep tonight.

49:59.330 --> 50:00.914
Hey, Billy, I'm sorry, man.

50:02.083 --> 50:03.541
I mean that!
I'm sorry!

50:50.715 --> 50:51.756
39 is the answer.

50:51.841 --> 50:53.967
What is the question?

50:54.760 --> 50:57.804
How many books are in
the Old Testament?

50:58.681 --> 51:00.140
I am so fuckin' good.

51:00.516 --> 51:01.641
Did Jeopardy!
Call yet?

51:02.309 --> 51:04.853
Not yet, but I'll
need a nice dress.

51:04.937 --> 51:07.021
When they call,
you got to be ready.

51:07.106 --> 51:08.690
You want to hear the books

51:08.774 --> 51:10.483
of the Old Testament backwards?

51:10.776 --> 51:14.028
It's Malachi,
Zechariah, Haggai...

51:14.113 --> 51:15.196
Honey, please.

51:15.281 --> 51:16.906
I did famous women

51:16.991 --> 51:19.117
and foods that
start with "Q."

51:19.577 --> 51:22.746
You couldn't imagine
how many foods there are

51:22.830 --> 51:24.581
that actually start
with "Q."

51:24.665 --> 51:26.374
Honey, will you please shut up?

51:26.667 --> 51:28.126
What's wrong with you?

51:29.879 --> 51:31.421
I lost the money.

51:33.048 --> 51:35.508
Oh, Jesus, Billy!

51:35.718 --> 51:37.260
Not again!

51:38.053 --> 51:39.137
How much?

51:39.221 --> 51:40.722
A lot of it.

51:42.391 --> 51:44.309
Most of it.

51:48.439 --> 51:50.398
Roughly... all of it.

51:50.649 --> 51:53.234
Billy, you lost all
our fuckin' money?

51:53.652 --> 51:54.944
Shit, Billy!

51:55.029 --> 51:56.529
Jesus, man!

51:57.406 --> 51:59.115
$1,700!

51:59.241 --> 52:00.325
Billy!

52:00.618 --> 52:02.952
We were on our way to 8,000!

52:03.746 --> 52:05.288
Were your opponents that good?

52:05.372 --> 52:08.208
I beat better guys in Jersey.

52:08.417 --> 52:10.168
You weren't hitting
your jump shots?

52:10.252 --> 52:11.753
I was hitting mine.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.129
What about Sidney?

52:13.422 --> 52:15.298
He had an off day.

52:15.382 --> 52:16.716
He wasn't shooting much.

52:17.051 --> 52:18.551
This guy scored on him.

52:18.677 --> 52:20.470
He wasn't D-ing up.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.639
He usually plays
good "D."

52:24.141 --> 52:26.184
You got hustled.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.977
I did not get hustled.

52:28.103 --> 52:32.023
You got set up.
You got hustled by Sidney!

52:32.149 --> 52:34.108
No. He's a good guy.

52:34.193 --> 52:35.902
You said he's full of shit!

52:36.070 --> 52:38.613
And he's a good guy!

52:38.906 --> 52:40.323
You're full of shit.

52:40.407 --> 52:41.825
And fuck that shit!

52:41.909 --> 52:43.201
I'm going back to that house

52:43.285 --> 52:45.245
and getting my money back.

52:45.579 --> 52:47.038
No, no, no, honey.

52:47.414 --> 52:50.416
A man cannot ask
for his money back.

52:50.751 --> 52:52.502
He lives in the jungle, right?

52:54.421 --> 52:56.714
No, honey, we can't.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.466
They don't let white people

52:58.551 --> 53:00.009
in the Crenshaw District.

53:00.094 --> 53:01.970
I don't know
about Puerto Ricans,

53:02.054 --> 53:04.180
but it's a reverse
discrimination thing.

53:04.265 --> 53:09.310
We dropped off Sidney on the corner
of Crenshaw and Washington.

53:09.395 --> 53:11.062
Honey, you don't understand.

53:11.355 --> 53:13.356
Men understand
how these things work.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.942
Wasn't there
an apartment house there?

53:16.360 --> 53:17.360
Let me explain.

53:17.444 --> 53:19.362
Men's rules are very simple.

53:19.446 --> 53:21.948
If you win, you win.
If you lose, you lose.

53:22.032 --> 53:24.784
You don't ask
for the money back.

53:25.870 --> 53:27.328
Why not?

53:27.663 --> 53:29.289
It's not part of the rules.

53:29.415 --> 53:34.210
Yeah? I got a different
set of rules.

53:34.295 --> 53:35.461
Want to hear them?

53:36.297 --> 53:40.049
Sometimes when you win,
you really lose.

53:40.301 --> 53:43.094
Sometimes when you lose,
you really win.

53:43.470 --> 53:46.139
Sometimes when you win
or lose, you actually tie.

53:46.390 --> 53:49.893
Sometimes when you tie,
you actually win or lose.

53:50.603 --> 53:52.228
I hate it when you
talk like that.

53:52.313 --> 53:54.397
It makes me crazy
when you talk like that.

53:54.690 --> 53:58.067
Winning and losing is
one big organic globule

53:58.235 --> 54:00.320
from which one extracts
what one needs.

54:01.405 --> 54:02.906
I'm fucked.

54:03.449 --> 54:05.241
Forget it.
I ain't... no, no.

54:05.326 --> 54:08.453
I'm not getting off this bus.

54:08.662 --> 54:10.121
No, stop!

54:15.711 --> 54:16.753
Can we discuss it?

54:16.837 --> 54:18.630
Can we have a discussion here?

54:21.592 --> 54:22.717
Yes?

54:22.801 --> 54:24.719
Does Sidney Deane live here?

54:25.512 --> 54:27.680
He does.

54:27.765 --> 54:29.015
He's my husband.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.976
Yeah, well,
your husband stole $1,700

54:32.061 --> 54:33.436
from my boyfriend.

54:38.192 --> 54:39.442
Really?

54:40.653 --> 54:42.362
Just a minute.

54:43.030 --> 54:44.113
Sidney?

54:44.198 --> 54:45.198
Yeah, baby?

54:45.282 --> 54:48.910
Some people out here
say you stole their money.

54:49.411 --> 54:50.870
Oh, shit.

54:52.247 --> 54:54.457
No, baby.
I didn't steal his money.

54:54.541 --> 54:55.917
I hustled his money.

54:56.001 --> 54:58.002
Yo! Cindy Brady!

54:58.087 --> 54:59.295
That girl is fine!

54:59.380 --> 55:01.047
Cindy Brady, what happened?

55:01.173 --> 55:02.674
What do you want?

55:02.841 --> 55:04.634
Who invited you in my house?

55:04.718 --> 55:07.553
I did.
I want to talk to...

55:07.680 --> 55:08.888
Gloria.

55:08.973 --> 55:10.723
That man hustled me

55:10.849 --> 55:12.684
long before I ever hustled him.

55:12.768 --> 55:14.686
I saw the whole thing.

55:14.770 --> 55:17.605
What goes around comes around.

55:18.941 --> 55:21.150
Then you won't mind
if Gloria and I talk.

55:21.235 --> 55:22.443
You want something to drink?

55:22.569 --> 55:23.736
Please.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.531
This boy got a lot of guts.

55:26.615 --> 55:30.201
Billy Ho!
Good to see you, Billy!

55:30.285 --> 55:31.452
You look swell!

55:32.287 --> 55:33.746
You fucked me, man.

55:34.081 --> 55:37.417
Get out in front of the TV.

55:37.960 --> 55:39.168
You fucked me!

55:39.253 --> 55:40.670
We had a partnership!

55:40.963 --> 55:43.006
We were never partners.

55:43.132 --> 55:44.549
Look, it goes like this.

55:44.758 --> 55:47.176
You either smoke,
or you get smoked.

55:47.386 --> 55:49.721
And you got smoked!
Ha ha!

55:49.805 --> 55:50.805
Clean as my gun.

55:50.889 --> 55:52.098
Yes, it was.

55:52.766 --> 55:53.808
Smooth.

55:53.892 --> 55:57.061
A thing of beauty
is a joy forever.

55:57.146 --> 56:00.106
Sidney, get this guy
to shut the fuck up!

56:00.190 --> 56:02.233
I'll go the way you like...

56:02.317 --> 56:04.485
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

56:05.696 --> 56:07.739
I want my money.

56:07.823 --> 56:09.407
You not getting the money back.

56:09.491 --> 56:11.617
You giving me my money back.

56:11.702 --> 56:13.327
I'm not giving you nothin'.

56:13.662 --> 56:15.621
Billy and Sidney were teammates.

56:15.789 --> 56:17.290
Teammates can't
hustle each other.

56:17.374 --> 56:18.791
Oh, really?
Why not?

56:18.917 --> 56:20.043
It's not artistic!

56:20.127 --> 56:23.296
I don't care about art, OK?

56:23.380 --> 56:24.797
All I care about is getting out

56:24.882 --> 56:26.549
of the Vista View
apartment building!

56:26.633 --> 56:28.968
There ain't no vista, no views,

56:29.053 --> 56:31.637
or no vista of views.

56:32.473 --> 56:34.766
You want cream, sugar, or what?

56:35.350 --> 56:36.642
Cream.

56:36.977 --> 56:40.104
I trusted you.
There are rules to hustling.

56:40.189 --> 56:41.481
There's an ethics involved.

56:41.565 --> 56:43.649
That you wouldn't know
anything about.

56:43.734 --> 56:46.235
I never shook anyone's hand
and stabbed him in the back.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.405
The Indians shook hands
with the Pilgrims,

56:49.490 --> 56:50.656
and look who got fucked.

56:51.492 --> 56:52.909
Who you calling Pilgrim?

56:52.993 --> 56:54.702
You, motherfucking
Christopher Columbus.

56:54.828 --> 56:55.870
Gobble this, turkey.

56:55.954 --> 56:57.705
I got a gun in my hand!

56:57.790 --> 56:58.790
What the fuck's wrong with you?

56:58.874 --> 57:00.583
Shoot this motherfucker!

57:00.667 --> 57:01.834
Hold it!

57:03.670 --> 57:04.796
It's up!

57:05.089 --> 57:06.089
Quick!

57:06.173 --> 57:07.799
Aw, man!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

57:08.133 --> 57:10.468
Pop it, James! Yeah!

57:11.386 --> 57:12.428
Good play.

57:12.513 --> 57:15.014
That's a black man.
That's a black man.

57:15.641 --> 57:18.142
Throughout our
glorious life together,

57:19.019 --> 57:21.979
I bought a car from the Stuccis
for 3 grand.

57:22.356 --> 57:24.941
It was shit.
I didn't want to pay.

57:25.025 --> 57:28.152
They told Billy unless he got
their money back,

57:28.237 --> 57:29.695
they would cut me up.

57:29.822 --> 57:31.906
He had to get the money back.

57:32.533 --> 57:35.868
The Stuccis decided
to fix a basketball game.

57:36.036 --> 57:37.370
Billy agreed,
but halfway through,

57:37.454 --> 57:39.288
he got pissed off
and didn't throw it.

57:39.373 --> 57:40.790
The Stuccis lost a bundle.

57:41.583 --> 57:44.585
Wake up, girlfriend.
It's your boyfriend.

57:44.711 --> 57:46.045
He's got some problems.

57:46.130 --> 57:48.131
He's just bad with money.

57:48.715 --> 57:51.384
The Stuccis are still after us.

57:51.510 --> 57:55.388
It's a sad story.
I'm sorry.

57:55.556 --> 57:57.557
But I'm not giving
you the money.

57:58.892 --> 57:59.976
I might, however,

58:00.060 --> 58:02.603
be willing to discuss
other arrangements.

58:06.066 --> 58:07.483
Hey, there's Cadee.

58:07.568 --> 58:08.568
That ain't Cadee.

58:08.652 --> 58:09.902
Oh, that's Eddie.

58:10.946 --> 58:12.363
All right, listen up.

58:12.447 --> 58:13.573
We have a solution.

58:13.657 --> 58:15.199
Tell them to move.

58:15.284 --> 58:18.202
They're black women.
You think I'm crazy?

58:18.287 --> 58:19.704
Here's the scenario.

58:19.997 --> 58:21.917
Rhonda's going to give me
some of the money back.

58:21.957 --> 58:23.708
We figured out a way
to get the rest.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.502
You guys need to kiss, make up,

58:26.587 --> 58:31.174
and play in that tournament.

58:31.717 --> 58:32.717
Hell, no.

58:32.801 --> 58:34.594
I ain't playing with
that son of a bitch.

58:35.262 --> 58:37.388
I don't hustle with people
who are dishonest.

58:37.472 --> 58:39.307
That's something I cannot do.

58:40.267 --> 58:42.185
That's not fair.

58:42.269 --> 58:44.812
Farrakhan disciple
son of a bitch.

58:45.522 --> 58:46.772
No, I ain't doing it.

58:47.107 --> 58:50.651
The stars belong to everyone

58:50.736 --> 58:51.736
Everyone

58:51.820 --> 58:55.573
They gleam there for you and me

58:57.159 --> 58:59.619
The flowers in spring

59:00.204 --> 59:02.538
The robins that sing

59:02.873 --> 59:05.208
The sunbeams that shine

59:05.292 --> 59:07.668
They're yours, they're mine...

59:08.503 --> 59:11.088
Welcome to the first annual

59:11.173 --> 59:15.551
Two-On-Two For Brotherhood
Basketball Tournament,

59:15.636 --> 59:19.555
also known as the TTBBT,

59:19.890 --> 59:23.184
sponsored by a coalition
of American corporations

59:23.268 --> 59:26.854
in the spirit of promoting
brotherhood among us all.

59:26.939 --> 59:27.939
That's bullshit.

59:28.023 --> 59:29.065
And now,

59:29.149 --> 59:32.360
let the games begin!

59:37.407 --> 59:39.575
Hey, wait!

59:39.660 --> 59:41.077
Oh, look at that.

59:41.161 --> 59:42.787
Why can't you check somebody,
mushroom head?

59:42.871 --> 59:44.747
You fat mustard
and butter sandwich.

59:44.831 --> 59:46.123
What you talking about?

59:48.043 --> 59:49.585
We ain't got
to worry about them.

59:49.670 --> 59:52.880
They spend too much time arguing
with each other about their mothers,

59:52.965 --> 59:54.465
and both their mothers are ugly.

59:55.342 --> 59:56.425
All right, all right.

59:56.510 --> 59:57.677
Yeah, sack it.

59:58.470 --> 59:59.595
Yeah, that's two...

59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.763
One for you.
One for you.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:02.848
Work-release program
or something.

01:00:03.058 --> 01:00:05.393
Motherfucker
was just on parole, man.

01:00:08.522 --> 01:00:11.065
These two we definitely
have to worry about.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.943
This is Flight. That's Willie.
They can play.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:15.861
They'll be
in the finals against us.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:19.573
Oh!

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:22.076
Shit, that's just too easy!

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.911
No, that shit is too easy!

01:00:23.996 --> 01:00:25.121
It's too easy!

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.707
No, that shit is too easy!

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:28.791
Fuck it.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.127
I don't want to play no more.

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:32.586
We won't play no more.

01:00:33.463 --> 01:00:34.880
Hey, chump.

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:37.091
Yeah, you, tater head.

01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:39.218
You know who I'm talking about.

01:00:40.012 --> 01:00:41.304
If that's your best game,

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:44.056
grab that free T-shirt
and head home.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.266
What the hell are you doing?

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:47.268
Did you bring Mighty Mouse?

01:00:47.936 --> 01:00:49.895
You're too pretty
to play basketball.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:54.275
You got that big "Z"
in your fro, man.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.153
Are you the black Zorro?

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:58.571
That's enough.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:01.490
You get your haircut
at the Braille institute?

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:03.117
What's Opie Taylor
talking about?

01:01:03.785 --> 01:01:04.952
Opie Taylor?

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:06.996
I got your Opie,

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.999
you big, bad, Gomer Pyle,
droopy-eyed son of a bitch.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.252
Take your ass back to Mayberry.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:16.005
Tell Aunt Bee
to have my bean pies,

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:17.173
or I'll kick her ass.

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:19.175
Hey, Lurch and Morticia.

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:20.379
What the fuck are you doing?

01:01:20.427 --> 01:01:22.511
I'm doing two things.

01:01:22.763 --> 01:01:25.681
I'm making them mad.
They won't play good.

01:01:25.766 --> 01:01:27.683
You're embarrassing me.

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:29.393
That's the other thing
I'm doing.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.520
You're not embarrassing me.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:33.022
You're pissing me off.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:36.400
Good. I assume you play better
when you're mad.

01:01:36.485 --> 01:01:37.860
Am I right?

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:39.236
I'm not listening.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.780
But you are hearing me.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:41.947
You're hearing me.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.825
You still throwing up bricks?

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.035
What did I say?

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:47.495
You still throwing up bricks?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:51.040
What is this,
a mason's convention?

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:53.876
I need a welding torch
to play in this league.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.547
Let's stop and gather
all these bricks.

01:01:58.799 --> 01:02:01.050
Let's build a homeless shelter

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:03.844
so maybe your mother
has a place to live.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:04.970
Fuck you!

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.764
Fuck that fucker!

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:07.848
And your sister, too.

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:10.851
I want your mother and your sister
out of my house.

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:12.228
Black ball.

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:15.189
What the fuck you talking about,
black ball?

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:16.273
What are you, racist?

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:18.651
I'm talking about your jersey.

01:02:18.819 --> 01:02:19.902
Here you go, sir.

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:22.154
How you feeling today?

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.989
Didn't I school you once before?

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.324
You going to give us a game?

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.118
Give us something, man.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:31.997
Don't let him pull that move on you,
Rastafari.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:33.582
Don't let him pull that move.

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:35.251
That's the move!

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:38.295
Oh! That's the move!

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.713
I tried to warn you.

01:02:39.798 --> 01:02:40.798
You call that defense?

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:42.049
You gonna give us a game?

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:43.551
Will we get
a little competition?

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:47.221
I got better things to do
with my Saturday.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.476
There's this chicky babe
from the fabulous four

01:02:52.561 --> 01:02:54.770
watching his big old ugly ass.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.106
Bring it on, bad boy!

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.441
Oh!

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:00.609
But he ain't got shit!

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:03.028
He ain't got shit!
He ain't got shit!

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.031
Ah! You suckers!

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.575
Bunch of suckers.

01:03:08.034 --> 01:03:10.703
What a great
no-look pass.

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:14.123
The mustard is off the hot dog.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:16.041
My man ain't getting nothing
tonight.

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:19.795
Lurch, I looked up
basketball player

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.480
in the dictionary,
and it said "not you."

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:24.383
Be quiet!

01:03:24.468 --> 01:03:25.968
Bring it on, bad boy!

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:27.178
Excuse me.
I'm talking here.

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:28.554
Shut up.

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:31.140
Pretty boy,
I'll be D-ing up on you

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:32.558
if you make it to the finals.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:36.270
Hey, I got some
bean pie for you.

01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:40.149
You ain't gonna see $5,000.
You may see 5,000 beans.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:43.068
Do you ever shut up?

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:45.321
What the fuck
are you worried about?

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:48.282
I'm in the fucking zone.

01:03:48.366 --> 01:03:50.576
It's one thing to embarrass me.

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.036
It's another motherfucking thing

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.246
to piss these guys off
that we have to play.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:55.789
That's plain fucking stupid.

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:58.125
Listen to your teammate,
bucket head.

01:03:58.210 --> 01:04:00.920
You've gone past stupid
into a new category.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:02.546
It's called suicide, chump.

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:04.673
Call me chump.
OK, bad boy.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:09.303
What the fuck is up with you?

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:10.593
What are you worried about?

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:13.015
I'm in the zone.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.142
They're pissed off.
I'm in the zone.

01:04:15.227 --> 01:04:17.811
This isn't about
black and white.

01:04:17.896 --> 01:04:20.606
This is about money,
you got that?

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:21.930
Look, man, I need this 5 grand.

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:25.236
I won't let you
blow this for me.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:26.862
You pissed off?

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.324
No, I ain't pissed off.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.618
You pissed off at me?

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:36.497
You want to get me
in this fucking zone.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.123
You ain't good enough.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.708
Is that another brother thing,

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:40.793
you fucking racist?

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.544
There's certain
things you can't do.

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:45.297
I can hear Jimi!

01:04:45.382 --> 01:04:46.715
You can't hear Jimi.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:48.008
Fuck you!

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:50.010
Good, fuck me.

01:04:50.095 --> 01:04:51.345
Say it with feeling.

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:52.638
Fuck you!

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:54.974
Fuck me! Fuck me!

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:56.558
Check, asshole.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:57.851
Go, Lurch.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.103
Check it, Casper.

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:01.772
You got shit for brains,
dickhead.

01:05:02.691 --> 01:05:03.816
Fuck you, faggot.

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:06.235
Let's go!

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.820
I got it

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:09.530
Watch magic

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:12.324
I got it, hey

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:16.161
I got something that makes me OK

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.752
Stop them before
we lose our sponsors.

01:05:27.299 --> 01:05:30.551
You start fighting,
neither of us will make money.

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:31.635
That bullshit passing you doing.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.803
Come on, man.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:35.222
I hope this doesn't get worse.

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:38.892
Now I got a move
that tells me what to do

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:40.519
Some kind of deal

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:46.483
Now I got a move
that tells me what to do

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:48.819
Sometimes I feel so nice

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:53.907
Why didn't you dunk it?

01:05:54.534 --> 01:05:55.993
Give me the fucking ball, man.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:58.287
Take the goddamn ball out.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:05:59.663
I'm in love

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:02.041
I love to do my thing

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:06.879
And I don't need no one else

01:06:08.048 --> 01:06:09.131
Brick!

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:13.052
You got the lane.
Take a shot.

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.313
Give me a better pass.
I have a better break.

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.973
It was a fucking great pass.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.934
Tired of piggybacking you.

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.019
You piggybacking me?

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:23.270
Yeah.

01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:31.236
Wham! Come on!
Stuff it down

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:41.205
You ever been to flight school?

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.332
I'm going to the seventh floor

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:44.500
and dropping you off
at the fifth.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:45.751
Stay on him!

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:48.212
Go Flight!
Go Flight!

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:50.589
Thank you, thank you.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:51.673
Big fucking deal.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.509
Can you do it?
Huh?

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.305
Yeah! Yeah!

01:06:59.391 --> 01:07:00.724
What it's all about

01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:05.604
He's setting illegal picks!

01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:11.819
Check them up.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:22.913
Cut, man.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.666
- In his ass.
- I got him.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.591
I got the something

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.635
Damn!
Come on, man.

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:38.220
I got that thing

01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:40.347
We need this.
Check him up.

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:42.224
I got soul

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.896
Goddamn, man.
$5,000 on the line.

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:49.606
You let this motherfucker
take the ball.

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.525
Opie pissing on you!

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:53.360
Oh, he's pissing on me now?

01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:55.779
Why don't you guard somebody?

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:58.615
Game point, $5,000.
Stop showing off.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:01.910
I've been saving your ass
the whole game.

01:08:01.995 --> 01:08:03.495
Shut the fuck up, man.

01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:05.914
Point game.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:08.000
Mr. Deane
and Mr. Hoyle.

01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:15.466
And all around

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.511
Right on, people

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:23.265
Let it all hang out

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:24.433
Cut! Cut!

01:08:24.517 --> 01:08:25.559
Will you cut?

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:27.769
Call the cops.
I got him!

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:34.818
Don't you boys know
what it's all about?

01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:36.612
Oh, shit!

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:39.448
Gimme, gimme

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:42.910
Gimme

01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:52.169
Let's pay them and get out.

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:53.795
Oh, yes!

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.130
Whoo!

01:08:55.215 --> 01:08:56.215
Yes, baby!

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.299
Damn!

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:58.502
You're supposed to help out!

01:08:58.551 --> 01:09:00.719
Why you dish that shit off?

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:03.930
I thought you
were going to dunk.

01:09:04.724 --> 01:09:06.767
You're lucky we didn't
cough up $5,000

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:08.100
on your hot dog shit.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.479
Why didn't you dunk it?

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:12.272
Right in his face!

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:13.857
Shut the fuck up.

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:16.859
Yes, yes,

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:20.404
it's wonderful when the spirit
of competition

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:23.075
brings out the best
in all of us.

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:25.827
And now I'd like
to award the checks

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:28.121
to the second-place
prize winners,

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:32.251
the fine team
of Dwight "The Flight" McGee

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:33.710
and Willie Lewis,

01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:36.921
receiving checks for $1,000.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.549
Yo, man, you said 1,500!

01:09:38.633 --> 01:09:39.841
That's $2,000.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:41.301
Oh, brotherhood, my ass!

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:42.636
You said 1,500!

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.680
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:46.723
I'll find you, motherfucker!

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:48.392
Buy yourself a dress!

01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:51.478
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

01:09:51.604 --> 01:09:54.815
the grand prize
for the first-place winners,

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:57.901
the wonderful team
of Sidney Deane

01:09:57.986 --> 01:10:00.112
and Billy Hoyle.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:01.863
Hey, put it there.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.658
I've never been able
to get that exactly right.

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:06.285
You ain't, either, motherfucker.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:07.828
And here is your check,

01:10:07.996 --> 01:10:09.121
and here is your check.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.605
"Sidney Deane"...
that look like me?

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.459
Now give them their trophies.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:16.295
You're welcome.

01:10:16.796 --> 01:10:17.879
What about the big trophy?

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:19.047
We keep the big trophy.

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:20.173
We won!

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:22.009
Give us the real trophy.

01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:25.387
We keep that trophy,
and we put your name on it.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.222
Thank you,

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:29.808
from the Coalition
of American Corporations

01:10:29.892 --> 01:10:32.311
and the TTBBT.

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:41.194
Whoo!

01:10:41.279 --> 01:10:43.030
She's going to love my ass.

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:44.990
Damn!

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:47.451
You know something?

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.827
I can jam, man.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.079
OK.

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:53.874
You keep telling everybody
I can't stuff it.

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.001
I say that to get
underneath your skin.

01:10:57.629 --> 01:11:00.380
Just 'cause I don't
do it in a game

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:01.548
don't mean I can't.

01:11:01.633 --> 01:11:02.716
OK, fine.

01:11:03.343 --> 01:11:06.470
But you don't think
I can stuff it.

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:10.766
Billy, I don't care

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:12.142
if you can or if you can't.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:16.021
Stop the fucking car.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.105
What?

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:18.690
Stop the car.
Pull it over.

01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:22.402
Turn that shit down.

01:11:22.487 --> 01:11:23.487
What is that shit?

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.113
It's good music.
Don't call it shit.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:29.201
I'll bet my half of the 5 grand
against your half

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.285
that I can stuff it.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:35.374
Let me give you some advice.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.919
Buy your girl a pretty dress

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:40.879
in case she gets on
that damn game show.

01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:43.256
You're either stupid
or dangerous.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:44.675
You can't be stupid

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:47.969
because stupid people know
they can't piss me off.

01:11:48.096 --> 01:11:50.180
So you must be dangerous.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:51.306
To who?

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:53.266
To yourself.
I'm taking you home.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:55.686
I don't jam in a game

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:58.814
because it's showboating
for the sake of showboating,

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:00.315
which you know about...

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.483
I look good playing.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:04.069
Like a behind-the-back pass
that's unnecessary.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:08.365
Passing? You have a hard-enough time
passing gas.

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.325
It goes back to what I said.

01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:14.121
A white man wants to win first,
look good second.

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:16.790
A black man wants to look good first,
win second.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.333
That's the most ridiculous

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:21.169
philosophical bullshit
I've ever heard.

01:12:21.254 --> 01:12:23.046
Look, right over here.

01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:24.506
There's a goal.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.633
Get your money, let's go.

01:12:26.759 --> 01:12:28.385
That's absolute garbage.

01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:29.511
I'm tired of your shit.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:33.932
Just put your money
where your mouth is.

01:12:34.559 --> 01:12:35.642
I just need three tries.

01:12:35.727 --> 01:12:38.311
That's all you need?
All right.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:41.148
One of us is definitely
not going home tonight.

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:43.775
Aah!

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:46.445
Man, you were almost there.

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:47.988
I was with you.

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.115
Damn. Come on, baby.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.616
You can do this.

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:54.536
Youse a sucker, man.

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.038
Is this shit regulation?

01:12:57.832 --> 01:12:59.458
This shit ain't regulation.

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:02.169
Get the fuck out of here.
Regulation?

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:03.587
Move out the way.

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:04.796
I'll check it for you.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:06.298
Move.

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:14.347
Yeah, yeah.

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.183
Just about right.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:18.059
Let's go, baby.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:19.186
I believe in you.

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.772
I know what the problem is.
Come on.

01:13:23.483 --> 01:13:25.942
Get out of the fucking way.

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:27.402
Yo, I'm trying to help.

01:13:27.487 --> 01:13:28.528
It's a bet.

01:13:28.613 --> 01:13:30.697
All right.
It's your money.

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:32.491
Go.

01:13:34.285 --> 01:13:35.786
Ah! Fuck me!

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:39.664
Mmm mmm mmm.

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:41.833
When I was looking at it before,

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:43.460
I thought it was
a little high myself,

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:44.836
but after re-evaluating,

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:48.465
I think it was
an optical illusion, right?

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:50.884
I know the problem.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.844
I can't let you
go out like that.

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:55.430
Get the fuck off me, man.

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:58.809
I'll pump you up.

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:01.436
It's a bet, man.
Stop fucking around.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.104
Billy.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:04.523
Shut up, man.

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.066
Billy.

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:07.192
Shut up.

01:14:07.276 --> 01:14:08.527
Billy, listen.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:09.653
What?

01:14:09.695 --> 01:14:12.322
White men can't jump.

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:26.002
Shit!

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:29.756
Good luck with Gloria.

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:35.303
If I lose, if I win

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.055
That sucker is stupid.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:40.642
I walk away with
both of the checks.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:42.435
White boys can be
stupid sometimes.

01:14:42.562 --> 01:14:48.108
This game is getting
very, very, very long

01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:49.609
Way to go, Billy.

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:51.236
Some you miss, and some you make

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:56.992
Some you give, and some you take

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:02.747
I guess I get it wrong

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:09.421
If I lose, if I tie

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:13.300
I am the truth, and I'm a lie

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:17.721
And I can't hear all the lyrics

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:22.517
To my song

01:15:22.602 --> 01:15:24.769
Some you fix, and some you break

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:30.442
Some you stand, some you shake

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:34.112
I guess I'll get it wrong

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:42.245
In a world of loving

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:45.040
Love exists

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:52.172
Please tell me how or where

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:57.135
I would gladly pay the price

01:15:58.137 --> 01:16:01.973
If I knew which way to go

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:08.813
Or if I ever despair

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:14.736
If I do leave, I'll drown

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:19.240
And I'm crying, and I'm alone

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:23.119
And my heart is waiting

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:27.624
Waiting for another goal

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.627
Some you beg, and some you steal

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:37.175
Some you fake, some you feel

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:43.473
Oh, yes, I'm getting it wrong

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:46.351
You called hours ago.

01:16:46.978 --> 01:16:49.270
Sidney's already home.

01:16:49.397 --> 01:16:51.064
Fucking pizza's all cold,

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.066
and the wine is warm.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:55.318
Present for you.

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:00.198
Oh, honey.

01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:05.036
Oh, God.

01:17:07.498 --> 01:17:09.749
What a shrew I am.

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:11.626
I'm sorry, honey.

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:14.087
Tell me about the tournament.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.339
There was some
decent players there.

01:17:16.465 --> 01:17:18.216
Me and Sidney played OK.

01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:21.970
OK? You guys
must have been great.

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.480
Oh...

01:17:36.068 --> 01:17:38.778
Oh, my, this is beautiful.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.457
Gloria?

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:52.876
Gloria.

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:54.753
Yes?

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:03.094
Um... this is beautiful.

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:05.096
Thank you.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.101
Honey...

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:20.111
I... Iost the money.

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:22.280
What?

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:36.753
I... Iost the money.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:49.099
You want to run that
by me one more time?

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:54.145
It, uh...

01:18:57.108 --> 01:18:59.067
It...

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.277
It happened again.

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:08.910
It?

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:10.662
No! No, Billy!

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:12.997
What the fuck is it it it?

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:14.457
There is no it!

01:19:14.542 --> 01:19:15.834
It is you!

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:17.502
You happened again!

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.337
Damn it, Billy!

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:28.513
The money was mine

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:31.516
to keep us going
till Jeopardy! Calls.

01:19:33.144 --> 01:19:34.435
Honey, Jeopardy!
Ain't going to call.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.688
When are you going
to fucking wake up?

01:19:36.856 --> 01:19:38.773
Jeopardy! Is
gonna call, Billy.

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:42.735
It's my destiny to triumph
magnificently on that show.

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:44.988
I'll never do that

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:47.949
wearing this stupid,
hootchy-mama-looking dress,

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.701
which was a poor excuse

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.537
to cover up the fact
that you fucked up again!

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:56.416
I'm gonna win, all right.

01:19:56.584 --> 01:19:58.710
I'm gonna get on
that motherfucking show,

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:00.628
and I'm gonna win

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:04.257
because I'm overwhelmed
with more useless goddamn information

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:07.719
than any human being
on this fucking planet!

01:20:08.095 --> 01:20:10.430
Who's James K. Polk?

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:12.974
How many moons are on Pluto?

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:14.601
What's a quince?

01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:15.935
It's a food, Billy,

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.229
that starts with
the letter "Q."

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:20.356
And I got seven more!

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:25.445
I can't believe
you lost the goddamn money!

01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:32.243
Honey, where you going?

01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:35.246
Honey?

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.665
Honey. Honey.

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:40.752
Honey, where you going?

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:42.337
You can't leave me.

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:43.713
What is a solar eclipse?

01:20:43.797 --> 01:20:45.256
Who's Marcel Cerdan?

01:20:45.424 --> 01:20:47.550
Where was
the hamburger invented?

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.136
What are you doing?

01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:51.638
Honey, you can't hitchhike.

01:20:51.722 --> 01:20:52.722
This is L.A.

01:20:52.806 --> 01:20:53.890
Go ahead!

01:20:53.974 --> 01:20:54.974
Billy!

01:20:55.059 --> 01:20:56.559
Go ahead.
She's just crazy.

01:20:56.644 --> 01:20:57.685
Go ahead!

01:20:58.437 --> 01:20:59.687
Billy.

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:01.356
Ow! These people
are perverts.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.440
Billy!

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:03.524
What?

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:04.984
The carpet's on fire.

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.196
Oh, shit.

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:11.115
Don't move, honey.

01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:13.034
Put your arm down.

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:20.583
Come on in here, honey.

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:30.635
Oh, shit!

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:32.470
Shit!

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.973
Don't you get in that truck!

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.646
Billy, you can run,
but you can't hide.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.356
The great Joe Louis said that.

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:45.191
You believe that?

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:47.110
Time to take a little ride.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.947
I'm telling you,
I lost the money.

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:54.575
I swear to God,
there's no money.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.995
Goddamn it, Billy.

01:21:58.998 --> 01:22:02.000
The shave was working.
It was beautiful.

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:04.043
Nobody would have known.

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:06.671
Why didn't you
go through with the fix?

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:09.340
Guy said I couldn't score.

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:11.217
He called me
a honky motherfucker.

01:22:11.302 --> 01:22:13.094
You are a honky motherfucker.

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:14.304
But I can score.

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:16.597
We were the team,
and you betrayed us.

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:19.434
Life is a bunch of bad trades.

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:21.602
One week.

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:24.439
Where's your
hot tamale girlfriend?

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:26.774
Where is she?
I liked her.

01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:27.859
She left me.

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.360
Oh, Billy!

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:30.445
Show him the fucking pictures!

01:22:30.529 --> 01:22:33.406
Get up. I'm going
to show you something.

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:36.034
This is what happens
to people who don't come through.

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.702
See these?

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:41.706
Look at the Polaroids!
Look at this guy.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:45.710
I swear to God, one week.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.837
One week.
That's all you get.

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:51.424
Maravich, my ass.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:53.301
I got your pistol
right here, Billy.

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:56.137
You got one week.
Understand?

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.187
Oh, man.

01:23:04.271 --> 01:23:05.897
Oh.

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:13.863
You're fakin' the funk

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:16.157
Talkin' that gangster hoopla

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.241
And probably a punk

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:18.993
And I'm-a let you know

01:23:19.078 --> 01:23:20.787
That this week
your ass can't cope

01:23:20.871 --> 01:23:22.205
With your offensive flow force

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:24.540
Mean kick, sidekick,
pack some nasty

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:27.043
Got to get smoked like a joint

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:29.170
They need to be rocked...

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:32.965
$5.00 an hour!

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:36.177
Hey, hey.
Got to open the door, baby.

01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:37.387
Cinco la hora.

01:23:37.763 --> 01:23:38.763
Hey, Sidney.

01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:39.931
¿Que pasa, Ruben?

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.015
¿Quiere trabajo?

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.100
No.

01:23:42.142 --> 01:23:44.352
Por cinco a la hora.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:45.436
No, no, no.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.563
Para otra semana.

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.024
All right.

01:23:50.109 --> 01:23:51.109
Sidney! You're late!

01:23:51.151 --> 01:23:52.777
Sorry. I'll be right there.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.445
¿Como esta?

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:57.532
Sidney, I've been
waiting for you.

01:23:57.616 --> 01:23:58.783
I'm very sorry.

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:01.953
My wife and I want
the Spanish tile

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.454
with the mansard roof.

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:04.956
Mmm, how unusual.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.040
Thank you.

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:07.125
But I don't want to get

01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:09.836
a city building permit.

01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:12.922
OK. I can go through the city
or around it.

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:14.841
I can eliminate the middleman

01:24:14.925 --> 01:24:16.676
or be the middleman.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.388
I'm offering the full service...
Roof, paint, plaster.

01:24:20.514 --> 01:24:23.808
My wife and I have decided
on number 88.

01:24:24.351 --> 01:24:25.726
Thank you.

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:28.312
If you write a check
to Sidney Deane...

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:30.565
That's D-E-A-N-E.

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:32.483
Sidney!

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:33.568
Dude.

01:24:33.652 --> 01:24:35.236
$300 could get me started.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.405
Sidney! Sidney.

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:39.782
Hey, man, how you doing?

01:24:39.867 --> 01:24:41.993
I got to talk to you.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:44.162
No. I'm doing business.

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:45.246
300.

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:46.998
It's really important, Sidney.

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:50.376
Thank you.
My regards to your wife.

01:24:50.461 --> 01:24:52.044
Tell her hi.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:53.921
God bless you.

01:24:54.006 --> 01:24:56.007
Goddamn it! What?

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.259
I'm desperate, man.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:01.762
A man should never
act desperate.

01:25:01.847 --> 01:25:03.347
It's impractical.

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:04.432
And frankly,

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:05.892
I find it rather ugly.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:08.186
I'd rather look ugly
and win than...

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.521
Shut the fuck up.

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:12.773
Sidney...

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:15.568
Gloria left me.

01:25:20.574 --> 01:25:21.949
I'm sorry, man.

01:25:22.034 --> 01:25:23.409
I don't know how,

01:25:23.494 --> 01:25:26.037
but I got to get her back.

01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:29.123
Oh, brother.

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:31.709
You know, I got this
grave human weakness,

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:34.420
a tiny little spot in my soul,

01:25:34.505 --> 01:25:36.631
that actually likes you.

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:38.341
It's horrible to admit,

01:25:38.425 --> 01:25:40.927
but everybody has got
a cross to bear,

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:42.887
and you're my damn cross.

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:44.138
What's that supposed to mean?

01:25:44.223 --> 01:25:45.973
It means I'll help you.

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:47.099
Yes!

01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:50.228
Don't kiss me, man.
I got no guarantees.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.605
What are you going to do?

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:54.732
I got an idea,

01:25:55.526 --> 01:25:57.026
but you're going to owe me.

01:25:57.861 --> 01:26:00.738
That's what I'm talking about!

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:03.741
You in my house.
What's up with you?

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:05.326
Oh, what you want now?

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:07.620
Pete, I don't need no pick.

01:26:08.205 --> 01:26:09.372
You ready?
You ready?

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:11.791
You call that "D"?
Where'd you go?

01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:13.209
You call that "D"?

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:15.169
Where are you?

01:26:15.254 --> 01:26:16.254
Yeah!

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:17.838
Whoo!

01:26:17.923 --> 01:26:19.215
That's what I'm talking about.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:21.551
This is my house!

01:26:21.635 --> 01:26:23.386
So where you going?

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:24.512
Got a job, baby.

01:26:24.596 --> 01:26:26.097
Robert, you're smooth.

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:27.974
Looking almost as good as me.

01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:30.101
Ah!

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:33.229
Yo, Billy,

01:26:33.313 --> 01:26:34.855
why don't you get that money
you won,

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.941
buy some new clothes?

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:40.403
Robert, are they still making
them TV game shows

01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:41.862
at the studio you work for?

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:44.865
All the game shows
are done on my lot.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:48.411
She's been trying
to get on that lot.

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:50.913
Robert, can you get her on?

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:54.875
Nobody gets on my lot
without a pass.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.919
I'm a security guard, man.

01:26:57.004 --> 01:27:00.631
Can you do it for me,
as a favor?

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:03.968
Ball breaker break your balls?

01:27:04.344 --> 01:27:06.053
She broke my heart.

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:09.473
Heart, balls... Details.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:10.558
Give me one reason

01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:12.122
why I should do anything
for this guy.

01:27:14.313 --> 01:27:15.938
I'll owe you.

01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:17.982
He'll owe you.

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:22.987
OK.

01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:26.324
Tell you what,

01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:29.076
I'll give you
one shot from there.

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:30.953
You make it,

01:27:31.038 --> 01:27:32.330
I'll let your girlfriend in.

01:27:32.414 --> 01:27:33.664
You miss, I get your car.

01:27:36.001 --> 01:27:37.835
No problem.

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:39.545
Yo!

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:41.464
No, no, no, no.

01:27:41.548 --> 01:27:44.425
Billy boy, this is Ghana.

01:27:44.509 --> 01:27:45.968
You, my friend,

01:27:46.053 --> 01:27:48.596
are shooting for the Sudan.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.805
Huh?

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:51.390
Ha ha ha!

01:27:51.475 --> 01:27:53.017
Yeah.

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:54.477
And a hook shot.

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.853
And a hook shot!

01:27:56.897 --> 01:27:58.272
Don't look at me.

01:27:58.357 --> 01:28:00.524
It's their court.
It's their rules.

01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:03.152
You want me to punt it?

01:28:04.946 --> 01:28:07.198
Can I use my right arm?

01:28:09.201 --> 01:28:10.993
He can't make it.

01:28:25.425 --> 01:28:26.425
Yes!

01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:32.306
This is Jeopardy!

01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:33.516

Who is Babe Ruth?

01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:49.717
No. That is wrong.

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:50.885
Babe Ruth?

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.678

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:56.677
Who was Victoriano Huerta?

01:31:56.761 --> 01:31:58.429
You are right.

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:00.306
What is a toadstool?

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:01.515
What is chlorophyll?

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.725
Yes!

01:32:02.809 --> 01:32:04.476
What are spores?

01:32:04.561 --> 01:32:05.603
What is Australia?

01:32:06.813 --> 01:32:09.189
What is the Outer Hebrides?

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:10.399
Yes!

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.318
Yeah!

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:13.944
Whoo!

01:32:17.324 --> 01:32:18.449
Gloria!

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:21.702
Billy, listen to me.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:23.370
Even if Gloria takes you back,

01:32:23.455 --> 01:32:25.205
which would be
a fucking miracle,

01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:27.207
don't blow it.

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:28.709
Listen to the woman carefully.

01:32:28.793 --> 01:32:29.877
Women know shit.

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:33.505
Even if you don't know
what she's talking about,

01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:34.590
just listen.

01:32:34.674 --> 01:32:35.925
All right.

01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:41.931
I'm sorry.
She doesn't want to see you.

01:32:42.015 --> 01:32:43.057
Gloria!

01:32:43.141 --> 01:32:46.060
Hey! I said she doesn't
want to see you.

01:32:46.144 --> 01:32:48.103
Jesus!

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:49.688
It's locked.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.440
Bitch.

01:32:51.483 --> 01:32:53.150
It's OK.
It's all right.

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.945
There's another door, man.
You're on your own.

01:32:56.029 --> 01:32:58.906
And remember, you owe me big.

01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.990
All right, man.

01:33:00.075 --> 01:33:01.492
All right?

01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:15.547
Honey.

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:17.716
All right...

01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:18.842
Don't say anything, all right?

01:33:18.927 --> 01:33:20.928
Just listen for a second.

01:33:23.181 --> 01:33:31.181
Ahem.

01:33:41.992 --> 01:33:45.452
I will never bring you water

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:48.205
When you're thirsting in our bed

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:50.582
You know I

01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:52.960
Understand dry-mouthedness

01:33:53.044 --> 01:33:58.048
And I sympathize instead

01:33:58.133 --> 01:34:01.051
And if you take me back again

01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:04.596
I won't be such a slob

01:34:06.766 --> 01:34:08.809
Let's screw.

01:34:10.562 --> 01:34:13.397
I'd even trade my sneakers in

01:34:13.565 --> 01:34:17.985
For the part-time job,
my Gloria

01:34:18.737 --> 01:34:21.280
My Gloria

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:24.324
Gloria

01:34:24.576 --> 01:34:27.828
My, my Gloria

01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:28.912
Gloria

01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:32.124
I know that you're angry

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:34.960
And you probably want me dead

01:34:35.295 --> 01:34:38.505
And I know screwing
is for carpenters

01:34:38.590 --> 01:34:41.341
So let's make love instead

01:34:41.593 --> 01:34:44.845
And I know I'll get it wrong

01:34:44.971 --> 01:34:47.598
So forgive me in advance

01:34:47.724 --> 01:34:55.724
Gloria

01:34:56.357 --> 01:35:00.277
My Gloria

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:04.198
Yeah

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:06.075
Tell me the truth.

01:35:06.409 --> 01:35:08.160
You didn't think that
Jeopardy! Would call,

01:35:08.244 --> 01:35:09.244
did you?

01:35:09.329 --> 01:35:11.914
I must confess, I didn't.

01:35:11.998 --> 01:35:14.875
That's why you got to
trust me more.

01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:16.752
You're right, as usual.

01:35:16.836 --> 01:35:18.754
I know.

01:35:18.838 --> 01:35:20.964
I've been thinking
about the future.

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:22.966
- I really...
- Me, too.

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:26.220
The future is like
a whole new concept.

01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:29.223
I mean, it's like...

01:35:29.307 --> 01:35:30.307
I got to confess

01:35:30.391 --> 01:35:31.431
that the summer pro league

01:35:31.476 --> 01:35:33.727
isn't knocking down my door.

01:35:33.812 --> 01:35:35.354
There comes a time
in every man's life

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:38.315
when he has to get on
with his life.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:48.909
I want you to take
2,000 of my winnings.

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:53.747
OK?

01:35:53.832 --> 01:35:56.083
I think that's a bad idea.

01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:58.502
No, it's a good idea.

01:35:58.586 --> 01:36:00.838
Go buy yourself
some new clothes.

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:04.967
Not for me. I like you
the way you are,

01:36:05.051 --> 01:36:08.303
but you got to look good
on job interviews.

01:36:08.388 --> 01:36:10.222
Job interviews?

01:36:10.306 --> 01:36:12.474
Yeah.

01:36:12.559 --> 01:36:14.810
I want you to aim high.

01:36:14.894 --> 01:36:17.312
Well, I, I...

01:36:17.397 --> 01:36:18.438
I want to aim high,

01:36:18.523 --> 01:36:19.565
but I'm just nervous

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:22.442
about taking your money again.

01:36:22.527 --> 01:36:24.695
I'm afraid I might
do something stupid.

01:36:26.072 --> 01:36:27.364
Take it.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:28.991
I trust you.

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:51.471
They took everything.

01:36:51.556 --> 01:36:52.556
I feel raped.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.640
They took everything!

01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:56.685
They wiped us out.
They took everything!

01:36:56.769 --> 01:36:59.688
They took my TV, the stereo,

01:36:59.772 --> 01:37:00.939
my baby's crib.

01:37:01.024 --> 01:37:05.527
What kind of human being
would steal a crib?

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:07.154
I've been trying to reach you.

01:37:07.238 --> 01:37:08.238
They took everything.

01:37:08.323 --> 01:37:09.323
Who?

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:10.574
Burglars.
Who do you think?

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:13.827
Your TV, your stereo,
everything.

01:37:13.912 --> 01:37:15.746
And they trashed the place!

01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:17.831
Oh, look at this here!

01:37:17.916 --> 01:37:20.042
I'll be goddamned!

01:37:20.126 --> 01:37:22.002
Baby, we'll get our stuff back.

01:37:22.086 --> 01:37:24.588
You promised
to get me out of here.

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:26.965
They took our $5,000.

01:37:27.258 --> 01:37:28.550
Wiped us out.

01:37:28.635 --> 01:37:31.678
I know somebody knows
what happened.

01:37:31.763 --> 01:37:35.849
You can't take that stuff
and not see something.

01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:38.518
You didn't have to
trash the place!

01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:41.939
Fuck me!

01:37:56.287 --> 01:37:57.496
I'm sorry.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:58.789
OK?

01:38:01.084 --> 01:38:02.876
I'm sorry.

01:38:09.133 --> 01:38:12.219
I'm sorry I lost it.

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:14.888
Baby, you don't have to
apologize to me.

01:38:16.182 --> 01:38:18.392
I want a job.

01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:23.188
OK.

01:38:23.273 --> 01:38:25.399
All right.
You get a job.

01:38:26.442 --> 01:38:27.482
Right now, I'll figure out

01:38:27.527 --> 01:38:30.112
how to get us out of
this goddamn building.

01:38:30.196 --> 01:38:31.780
All right?

01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:40.914
If I can win 12,000
each week, right?

01:38:40.999 --> 01:38:42.249
Times 5,

01:38:42.333 --> 01:38:44.751
plus 20 for the annual title,

01:38:44.836 --> 01:38:46.837
that'll give us...

01:38:46.921 --> 01:38:48.547
80 grand.

01:38:48.631 --> 01:38:49.923
We're rolling now.

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:53.385
I could take
some acting classes,

01:38:53.469 --> 01:38:56.888
get on a soap,
do a little television.

01:38:56.973 --> 01:38:58.890
I'll be ready for the big screen
in two years.

01:38:58.975 --> 01:39:01.059
You're made for the big screen.

01:39:02.603 --> 01:39:03.687
Billy!

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:04.771
It's Sidney.

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:05.856
Sidney.

01:39:05.898 --> 01:39:07.357
Hey, Billy!

01:39:08.985 --> 01:39:09.985
Billy.

01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:11.069
Sidney.

01:39:11.154 --> 01:39:12.654
I've been looking for you.

01:39:12.739 --> 01:39:15.032
We got to talk, alone.

01:39:15.533 --> 01:39:17.617
What's this, a macho dick thing?

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:18.702
Come on, now.

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.370
Can I watch?

01:39:20.705 --> 01:39:22.664
Don't worry about me, babe.

01:39:25.752 --> 01:39:27.919
Billy, you got some money?

01:39:28.004 --> 01:39:29.463
A little. Why?

01:39:29.547 --> 01:39:32.174
Eddie "The King" Faroo
and Duck Johnson are back.

01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:34.301
They're working courts downtown.

01:39:34.385 --> 01:39:35.385
They're cleaning up.

01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:37.971
The King and Duck?
We can take them!

01:39:38.056 --> 01:39:40.807
It costs 2,500 to get in.

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:43.894
I got 2 grand, man!

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:45.896
Good, good.
Let's do this.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:48.065
Hold it.
Hold it. Hold it.

01:39:51.069 --> 01:39:52.569
Hold on, man.

01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:55.364
I just got back together
with Gloria.

01:39:55.448 --> 01:39:56.907
I don't know how she'll react.

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:59.534
This money could
save my marriage.

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:02.996
With this score,
I could move in a week.

01:40:03.081 --> 01:40:06.208
I don't think she'll go for it.

01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:08.001
Make her!
Fuck that.

01:40:08.086 --> 01:40:09.419
You owe me.

01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:11.922
I know, man, but I...

01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:13.924
All right.
Enough man talk.

01:40:14.008 --> 01:40:15.801
What's up?

01:40:15.885 --> 01:40:17.010
Honey,

01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:19.221
you are so beautiful.

01:40:19.305 --> 01:40:21.765
Sometimes I don't realize
how lucky I am.

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:25.100
You know something, honey?

01:40:25.103 --> 01:40:27.229
There is a big game downtown.

01:40:29.273 --> 01:40:30.273
For money?

01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:31.358
No! No, no.

01:40:31.442 --> 01:40:34.361
Well, yeah.
I mean, a little bit.

01:40:34.445 --> 01:40:36.780
Billy!
Are you serious?

01:40:37.073 --> 01:40:39.783
You're thinking about playing
with my money?

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:42.911
Your money?
You gave it to me!

01:40:42.995 --> 01:40:44.162
To get a job!

01:40:45.123 --> 01:40:46.415
I promised Sidney, honey.

01:40:46.499 --> 01:40:47.999
You promised me!

01:40:48.376 --> 01:40:50.168
I promised you and him.

01:40:50.253 --> 01:40:52.504
I owe you and him.

01:40:52.588 --> 01:40:54.089
I'll give you the winnings.

01:40:54.173 --> 01:40:56.133
I don't care about the money.

01:40:56.634 --> 01:40:59.302
I don't want the money!

01:40:59.387 --> 01:41:00.387
What do you want?

01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:02.389
I want you, stupid!

01:41:02.473 --> 01:41:05.725
We can take these guys.
They're over the hill.

01:41:06.644 --> 01:41:09.271
Look, Billy,
you gamble my money,

01:41:09.355 --> 01:41:10.772
and we're through.

01:41:10.857 --> 01:41:13.567
I promise this is the last time.

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:17.529
Do you think that
I'm a fucking moron or something?

01:41:17.613 --> 01:41:20.365
You take me for an idiot?

01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:21.908
All right.

01:41:21.993 --> 01:41:24.828
All right.
I have a solution, OK?

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:26.705
I will guarantee victory.

01:41:26.789 --> 01:41:28.582
I've never offered that before.

01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:30.542
I will guarantee victory.

01:41:30.626 --> 01:41:32.085
I... We...

01:41:32.170 --> 01:41:34.880
We can guarantee
victory. Huh?

01:41:38.301 --> 01:41:39.718
Yeah.

01:41:50.146 --> 01:41:52.063
I love you, Billy.

01:41:57.153 --> 01:41:58.528
Goodbye.

01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:17.839
Honey.

01:42:18.966 --> 01:42:21.218
All right, honey.

01:42:21.302 --> 01:42:24.221
All right. Listen,
if you don't want to watch,

01:42:24.305 --> 01:42:26.389
we'll just meet up
at the hotel later,

01:42:26.474 --> 01:42:27.974
and we'll party.

01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:29.809
We'll celebrate.

01:42:29.894 --> 01:42:31.061
We're on a roll, honey.

01:42:32.688 --> 01:42:34.397
We're on a roll!

01:42:43.407 --> 01:42:45.992
Show him that fly shit, Sidney.

01:42:46.077 --> 01:42:48.537
Come on, Billy.
You got him, Sidney.

01:42:48.621 --> 01:42:49.621
He can dunk, baby.

01:42:49.705 --> 01:42:53.124
You got him.
I got Billy.

01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:54.251
All right.

01:42:55.586 --> 01:42:57.170
King, shut him out!

01:42:57.255 --> 01:42:58.630
Come on, Duck!

01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:00.632
You got some money?

01:43:00.716 --> 01:43:02.676
Hell, yeah.
I got $50.

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.804
You got me.
I got Billy.

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:35.125
Pop! Pop! Pop!

01:43:35.293 --> 01:43:37.085
Sweet!

01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:38.378
Oh, yes!

01:43:38.462 --> 01:43:39.462
Yeah!

01:43:41.132 --> 01:43:42.799
Yes! Yes!

01:44:03.654 --> 01:44:05.196
Sweet!
Sweet! Sweet!

01:44:05.615 --> 01:44:07.282
"D" up!
"D" up!

01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:09.909
Stay up.
Stay up on him.

01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:11.911
Watch the pick!

01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:14.164
Watch the back door!
Back door!

01:44:19.295 --> 01:44:20.962
Yes! Come on.

01:44:23.633 --> 01:44:24.633
Take it in.

01:44:24.717 --> 01:44:26.635
Take it in, Sid!
Yeah!

01:44:26.719 --> 01:44:28.345
All right, man!

01:45:04.215 --> 01:45:06.007
Play some defense, Billy!

01:45:08.719 --> 01:45:09.803
Dig this

01:45:10.596 --> 01:45:11.721
I love the pearl

01:45:11.806 --> 01:45:13.348
Ow! Where's my girl?

01:45:13.766 --> 01:45:14.766
Ow!

01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:18.687
All the way, baby.

01:45:19.438 --> 01:45:20.814
Yeah.
Way to go.

01:45:20.898 --> 01:45:22.190
Way to go, baby.

01:45:22.274 --> 01:45:23.858
Damn!

01:45:24.402 --> 01:45:26.236
Uh!

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:31.574
Fuck!

01:45:33.786 --> 01:45:35.453
Get your hands up.

01:45:36.622 --> 01:45:38.081
Come on, man!

01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:42.419
Push it, Sidney.
In, baby, in!

01:45:42.545 --> 01:45:44.045
My man!

01:45:44.130 --> 01:45:46.339
Ah! Ya-haa!

01:45:48.259 --> 01:45:49.467
Yeah, yeah!

01:45:49.552 --> 01:45:50.927
Yeah, Sidney!

01:45:56.767 --> 01:45:58.184
All of it on the line.

01:45:58.269 --> 01:45:59.436
14-13.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:01.312
Point game.
Point game.

01:46:03.107 --> 01:46:05.233
Got to put the ball up, man.

01:46:06.110 --> 01:46:07.527
You're gonna rock, aren't you?

01:46:07.611 --> 01:46:09.446
Come on with it.

01:46:10.865 --> 01:46:12.157
Hit him hard, man.

01:46:12.241 --> 01:46:13.825
Hit him hard.

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:15.702
Stay with him.
Stay with him.

01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:18.170
You want to dance
or play basketball, brother?

01:46:22.626 --> 01:46:25.378
You going to dance
or play ball, man?

01:46:25.463 --> 01:46:27.172
Watch him down low.

01:46:27.882 --> 01:46:29.048
I got him.
I got him.

01:46:37.808 --> 01:46:39.642
To the right!

01:46:39.727 --> 01:46:41.686
Bringing it up.
Watch him! Watch him!

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:44.314
Give it up, man.

01:46:44.398 --> 01:46:45.815
Watch the pick.

01:47:01.832 --> 01:47:08.087
Aaahh!

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:10.507
Hoo hoo!

01:47:10.591 --> 01:47:12.842
Whoo!

01:47:32.863 --> 01:47:33.863
Gloria.

01:47:33.906 --> 01:47:35.532
Gloria?

01:47:37.952 --> 01:47:44.290
Gloria!

01:47:44.375 --> 01:47:46.459
Honey!

01:47:51.423 --> 01:47:53.049
She's gone.

01:47:56.053 --> 01:47:57.762
Oh, man!

01:47:58.347 --> 01:48:00.932
Oh, man. Now,
that's not right.

01:48:01.392 --> 01:48:03.226
That's not right.

01:48:04.728 --> 01:48:06.896
I didn't lose the money.

01:48:06.981 --> 01:48:08.565
I doubled the money,

01:48:08.649 --> 01:48:09.691
and I still got it wrong.

01:48:09.775 --> 01:48:11.359
How can that be?

01:48:17.575 --> 01:48:19.576
She said some crazy shit.

01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:21.286
She said sometimes when you win,

01:48:21.370 --> 01:48:23.997
you actually lose or tie,

01:48:24.081 --> 01:48:26.499
but when you tie,
you actually win,

01:48:26.584 --> 01:48:28.459
or some shit.

01:48:28.544 --> 01:48:30.211
You got to extract something

01:48:30.296 --> 01:48:32.297
from an organic globule.

01:48:32.381 --> 01:48:36.426
Brother, I only have
four words for you...

01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:39.012
Listen to the woman.

01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:41.514
What the hell does that mean?

01:48:41.599 --> 01:48:43.099
I tried to listen.

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:44.601
You talked me out of it!

01:48:44.685 --> 01:48:49.272
I presented an option,
and you took it.

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:51.357
You should have listened
to her, not me.

01:48:51.442 --> 01:48:53.985
I should listen to you now?

01:48:54.069 --> 01:48:55.278
Yeah. I'm giving
you advice.

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:56.362
Who should I listen to?

01:48:56.447 --> 01:48:58.990
You're a grown man.
Figure that out yourself.

01:49:09.251 --> 01:49:11.210
Oh, shit.

01:49:17.509 --> 01:49:18.968
Ah!

01:49:20.971 --> 01:49:23.556
The game is over, William.

01:49:23.641 --> 01:49:25.475
Still hit the old jumper,
huh, Billy boy?

01:49:25.768 --> 01:49:27.518
Where's the cash?

01:49:39.073 --> 01:49:41.574
OK, Frankie.
That's enough.

01:49:41.659 --> 01:49:42.659
That's good for you guys?

01:49:42.701 --> 01:49:44.202
Yeah.
We're all set.

01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:51.250
We can finally show our face again
at Tipitina's.

01:49:51.335 --> 01:49:53.544
The Stucci brothers are back.

01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:55.088
No hard feelings,
huh, Billy boy?

01:49:55.172 --> 01:49:56.381
No.

01:49:57.841 --> 01:49:59.717
Billy,

01:49:59.802 --> 01:50:02.011
it's all about respect.

01:50:02.096 --> 01:50:03.137
You understand?

01:50:03.222 --> 01:50:04.555
Good.

01:50:06.183 --> 01:50:08.059
I respect you guys.

01:50:14.066 --> 01:50:15.733
See you later.

01:50:23.117 --> 01:50:25.201
Yo, man, you all right?

01:50:27.037 --> 01:50:29.288
Gloria is not coming back.

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:32.458
Yeah, I know.

01:50:36.839 --> 01:50:38.039
You know, she's left me before,

01:50:38.048 --> 01:50:39.132
lots of times.

01:50:39.216 --> 01:50:40.216
She'll get to the door,

01:50:40.259 --> 01:50:43.720
I'll talk fast,
she'll come back.

01:50:43.804 --> 01:50:45.263
Or she'll get out the door,

01:50:45.347 --> 01:50:48.141
be gone a couple of days,

01:50:48.225 --> 01:50:51.019
and I'll play her a song,

01:50:51.103 --> 01:50:53.896
and, you know, she'll come back.

01:50:54.857 --> 01:50:56.691
This is it.

01:50:57.651 --> 01:50:59.402
She's gone.

01:51:03.449 --> 01:51:04.569
Maybe you two are better off

01:51:04.575 --> 01:51:05.700
without each other.

01:51:06.785 --> 01:51:07.952
Yeah.

01:51:10.914 --> 01:51:11.956
Tell me something, Sidney.

01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:13.166
If I listen to the woman,

01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:15.626
do I have to agree
with her, too?

01:51:15.711 --> 01:51:18.129
You listen.
That's a start.

01:51:18.213 --> 01:51:20.048
I don't want to stress you out.

01:51:20.174 --> 01:51:23.676
Hmm hmm Doo doo doo doo

01:51:23.844 --> 01:51:28.723
Mmm hmmm

01:51:31.268 --> 01:51:33.311
I got to get a job.

01:51:36.607 --> 01:51:38.274
Can you get me a job?

01:51:40.694 --> 01:51:42.987
Have you got any references?

01:51:43.072 --> 01:51:44.530
You.

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:48.618
You're going to be all right.

01:51:48.702 --> 01:51:51.037
You're starting
to hear the music.

01:51:51.121 --> 01:51:52.497
I can hear Jimi now?

01:51:52.581 --> 01:51:56.334
I didn't say that.
You can't hear Jimi.

01:51:56.418 --> 01:51:57.418
Jimi ain't music?

01:51:57.461 --> 01:51:59.545
It is, but you can't hear Jimi.

01:52:01.173 --> 01:52:02.423
Don't be dissin' Jimi.

01:52:02.508 --> 01:52:04.008
You just learned that word.

01:52:04.093 --> 01:52:06.385
How did you know
you put that pass

01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:08.387
up high enough, I could slam it?

01:52:08.472 --> 01:52:12.308
Even the sun shines
on a dog's ass some days.

01:52:12.392 --> 01:52:15.103
On a dog's ass?
Want to play me?

01:52:15.187 --> 01:52:18.231
Don't start.

01:52:18.357 --> 01:52:21.400
Hitting one dunk
don't mean you can play.

01:52:21.485 --> 01:52:24.112
Putting a cat in an oven
don't make it a biscuit.

01:52:24.196 --> 01:52:28.074
Your mama is so stupid,
it takes her 60...

01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:29.909
It takes her 2 hours
to watch 60 minutes.

01:52:29.993 --> 01:52:31.369
Stop hurting yourself.

01:52:33.497 --> 01:52:34.914
Hey, man.

01:52:34.998 --> 01:52:36.082
Smooth, baby.

01:52:36.208 --> 01:52:37.250
You dropped a 20 on them?

01:52:37.334 --> 01:52:41.754
Yeah. If I don't take care
of my brothers, who will?

01:52:43.674 --> 01:52:46.384
I'll bet you 20 on our game.

01:52:46.468 --> 01:52:48.386
I'm not playing you.

01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:50.138
No, no. You misunderstand.

01:52:50.305 --> 01:52:53.724
How could you look ugly
and still lose?

01:52:53.809 --> 01:52:55.893
You calling me ugly?

01:52:55.978 --> 01:52:57.645
Your mother did.
I got a right to.

01:52:57.729 --> 01:53:00.690
Can you come out and play?

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:05.778
Do you think you can hang
with a real man?

01:53:06.071 --> 01:53:09.240
Can you come out and play?

01:53:10.367 --> 01:53:14.245
Do you think you can hang
with the real thing?

01:53:14.538 --> 01:53:17.039
You were dressed up that night

01:53:18.041 --> 01:53:19.083
Uh, uh

01:53:19.293 --> 01:53:21.794
You were turnin' men away

01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:22.962
Oh, baby

01:53:23.046 --> 01:53:25.882
Girl, you were so fine

01:53:26.425 --> 01:53:30.887
Ooh, I, I couldn't let you
get away

01:53:31.722 --> 01:53:32.722
White

01:53:32.806 --> 01:53:34.015
Men

01:53:34.099 --> 01:53:35.141
White

01:53:35.225 --> 01:53:36.225
Men

01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:37.310
White

01:53:37.394 --> 01:53:40.146
Men

01:53:40.230 --> 01:53:41.230
White

01:53:41.315 --> 01:53:46.652
To the beat, y'all

01:53:46.904 --> 01:53:48.196
Men

01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:51.407
Sometimes you have to do

01:53:51.742 --> 01:53:53.659
What you gotta do

01:53:54.286 --> 01:53:56.204
To even out the score

01:53:56.288 --> 01:53:57.455
That's right

01:53:57.748 --> 01:53:59.957
Don't ever fake the game

01:54:00.042 --> 01:54:02.627
It's not a sure thing

01:54:02.711 --> 01:54:06.088
Hold on and jam it through

01:54:06.173 --> 01:54:07.965
Bet your bottom dollar

01:54:08.050 --> 01:54:10.301
That you can make them holler

01:54:10.385 --> 01:54:13.512
Don't you know that
white men can't jump?

01:54:13.597 --> 01:54:14.847
Yeah, yeah

01:54:14.932 --> 01:54:16.515
And if you say it louder

01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:18.601
Then you might make me prouder

01:54:18.936 --> 01:54:21.604
Don't you know that
white men can't jump?

01:54:22.105 --> 01:54:23.940
White men can't jump

01:54:24.024 --> 01:54:27.235
To the beat, y'all

01:54:27.569 --> 01:54:29.570
Don't you know that
white men can't jump?

01:54:29.655 --> 01:54:31.197
Yeah, yeah

01:54:31.782 --> 01:54:35.326
213

01:54:35.911 --> 01:54:37.370
Area code

01:54:39.581 --> 01:54:42.208
Berdoo hick, a new dip
of a showroom stick

01:54:42.292 --> 01:54:43.960
Going hell-for-leather
on metal clip

01:54:44.044 --> 01:54:45.544
Pullin' it,
I got to deal with it

01:54:45.629 --> 01:54:47.713
Throw the body in the trunk
and get rid of it

01:54:47.798 --> 01:54:50.424
That's how I'm livin',
givin', AK-47

01:54:50.509 --> 01:54:52.134
Got to be out by 11

01:54:52.219 --> 01:54:54.136
Gangster sniper, grow hyper

01:54:54.221 --> 01:54:56.055
Disguised himself
as a window wiper

01:54:56.139 --> 01:54:57.640
Stood there through the glass

01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:59.016
Get the gat, it's dead

01:54:59.101 --> 01:55:00.226
I gotta think fast

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:03.062
Movin', always thinkin',
droppin' three skin

01:55:03.146 --> 01:55:04.355
The body bag's stinkin'

01:55:04.439 --> 01:55:06.899
Everyone's thinkin',
goin' big, till I slip in

01:55:06.984 --> 01:55:08.401
Tie you up and start whippin'

01:55:08.485 --> 01:55:11.362
Help move the bit to a new level

01:55:11.446 --> 01:55:12.571
Return of the brown devil

01:55:12.656 --> 01:55:15.992
213

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:18.244
Area code

01:55:18.453 --> 01:55:19.912
Come on, we goin' down like this

01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.497
Come on

01:55:21.707 --> 01:55:23.541
I'm going up

01:55:23.917 --> 01:55:26.043
And I won't come down

01:55:27.004 --> 01:55:29.005
There's no regrets

01:55:29.339 --> 01:55:31.590
In this world I've found

01:55:32.342 --> 01:55:34.176
I can hear music

01:55:34.594 --> 01:55:36.762
Of a joyful sound

01:55:37.431 --> 01:55:39.140
I'm going up

01:55:39.850 --> 01:55:41.976
And I won't come down

01:55:42.769 --> 01:55:44.353
I'm going up

01:55:45.022 --> 01:55:47.356
And I won't come down

01:55:47.441 --> 01:55:48.524
I ain't coming down.

01:55:53.447 --> 01:55:55.823
Look for the hook

01:55:55.991 --> 01:55:58.075
Everybody, everybody,
here comes the hook

01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:59.827
Went to the studio
to make another hit

01:55:59.911 --> 01:56:02.246
The tempo being funky,
this is funky as it get

01:56:02.331 --> 01:56:03.456
If you trip, watch your lip

01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:05.249
With a quick pass, then tip fast

01:56:05.334 --> 01:56:07.335
Like I did when I cut class...
still passed

01:56:07.419 --> 01:56:09.628
Mommy was a teacher,
and Daddy was a cop

01:56:09.713 --> 01:56:11.964
So I was born a brain
with a very good shot

01:56:12.049 --> 01:56:14.383
Jersey born and bred
in an old one-horse 'stead

01:56:14.468 --> 01:56:15.468
That's where I got my practice

01:56:15.552 --> 01:56:17.303
Building bloods
with the hardheads

01:56:17.387 --> 01:56:19.430
Yeah, I'm a roughneck
with a rough threat

01:56:19.514 --> 01:56:20.514
Wanna step? Bet

01:56:20.599 --> 01:56:22.516
No, this ain't a prank,
it's a death threat

01:56:22.601 --> 01:56:25.227
From Latifah, the big chief,
for all of y'all to look

01:56:26.063 --> 01:56:27.063
Here comes the hook

01:56:27.147 --> 01:56:29.440
This is the hook

01:56:29.524 --> 01:56:31.817
Everybody, everybody,
jump up and look

01:56:31.902 --> 01:56:34.195
This is the hook

01:56:34.279 --> 01:56:36.655
Everybody, everybody,
jump up and look

01:56:36.740 --> 01:56:37.865
Left hook, uhh

01:56:37.949 --> 01:56:39.033
Right hook, uhh

01:56:39.117 --> 01:56:40.326
Left hook, uhh

01:56:40.410 --> 01:56:41.452
Right hook, uhh

01:56:41.536 --> 01:56:42.745
Left hook, uhh

01:56:42.829 --> 01:56:43.829
Right hook, uhh

01:56:43.914 --> 01:56:45.164
Left hook, uhh

01:56:45.248 --> 01:56:46.916
Right hook, uhh

01:56:47.542 --> 01:56:48.542
