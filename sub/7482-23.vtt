00:07.889 --> 00:10.381
Hey, little man,
your daddy's got game.

00:10.558 --> 00:13.186
Yo, Ed. Nice.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.159
You were pounding the ball
out there, man.

00:15.330 --> 00:17.298
You set it up so good,
the ball's hitting itself.

00:17.465 --> 00:19.763
- You know it. All day.
- All night.

00:21.836 --> 00:23.065
What do you think?

00:23.238 --> 00:24.399
Where we gonna put this one?

00:24.572 --> 00:27.064
On display with the rest of them.

00:27.242 --> 00:28.835
I guess I can make room.

00:29.010 --> 00:30.341
Hey, stop!

00:31.146 --> 00:33.342
- Stop! My camera!
- Let's get him, Roy.

00:34.249 --> 00:35.808
Stop!

00:36.951 --> 00:38.350
Take his flank.

01:29.270 --> 01:31.170
Linda!

01:45.119 --> 01:46.985
Baby.

02:07.575 --> 02:09.600
Homeland's network. I want updates.

02:09.776 --> 02:13.236
Initiate a vector search on chatter,
keyword "Venice."

02:13.414 --> 02:14.540
What's the latest, Nell?

02:14.716 --> 02:16.741
Two fatalities, 26 wounded.

02:16.918 --> 02:19.751
Info's still coming in,
but it's looking like a terrorist attack.

02:21.456 --> 02:23.857
Hetty had me bring in
some more techs for processing intel.

02:24.025 --> 02:26.065
- You talked to other agencies?
- CIA's got nothing.

02:26.227 --> 02:27.592
FBI's casting a wide net.

02:27.762 --> 02:30.026
- Anybody claiming responsibility?
- No, nothing yet.

02:31.099 --> 02:33.363
- It's just a matter of time.
- Sorry I'm late.

02:33.534 --> 02:35.054
Stopped to give blood.
What do we have?

02:35.203 --> 02:38.434
Well, the immediate area around
the explosion has been closed off.

02:38.606 --> 02:39.869
Navy sealed off the bay.

02:41.576 --> 02:44.238
What? I surf on Saturdays.
You thinking foreign or domestic?

02:44.412 --> 02:46.492
Until we identify them,
it doesn't make a difference.

02:46.648 --> 02:50.642
Mr. Callen is right.
And right now, time is of the essence.

02:50.818 --> 02:53.446
I suggest you start in Ops.

03:02.997 --> 03:04.761
It was a Marine-sponsored
charity event.

03:04.932 --> 03:08.698
The footage was taken by tourists' cell
phones and nearby security cameras.

03:08.870 --> 03:10.770
Now, the two men giving chase

03:10.938 --> 03:14.272
are Marine Sergeants Edward Jones
and Roy Kilpatrick.

03:14.442 --> 03:16.206
Now, they both returned home
two weeks ago

03:16.377 --> 03:18.072
from a tour in Afghanistan.

03:18.246 --> 03:20.510
The man they're chasing,
Brian Colvern.

03:20.682 --> 03:21.774
History of petty theft.

03:22.483 --> 03:25.475
Colvern and Sergeant Kilpatrick
were the two reported fatalities.

03:25.653 --> 03:29.351
Survives Afghanistan,
dies in a terrorist attack at home.

03:29.524 --> 03:30.582
Car bomb.

03:32.327 --> 03:34.227
The ice truck
took the brunt of the blast.

03:34.395 --> 03:35.988
Could have been a lot worse.

03:36.164 --> 03:37.256
A Saturday.

03:37.432 --> 03:40.367
Military personnel, lot of tourists,
cameras.

03:40.535 --> 03:41.934
It was a perfect target.

03:42.103 --> 03:44.037
Lots of footage for the 6:00 news.

03:44.205 --> 03:45.765
We have any idea
how that car got there?

03:45.940 --> 03:48.034
This is from seven hours earlier.

03:48.209 --> 03:50.644
Here's what we've got.
The footage is low-res.

03:50.812 --> 03:53.338
I did my best to enhance it.

03:53.514 --> 03:55.107
There's no way to ID these guys.

03:55.283 --> 03:56.614
You can't take out that license?

03:56.784 --> 03:59.151
I've tried.
There's just not enough to work with.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.913
No one blinks twice
at a meter maid car.

04:01.089 --> 04:02.579
Yeah, except it's not.

04:02.757 --> 04:04.157
It was fitted out to look like one.

04:04.292 --> 04:07.523
I'm running a Kaleidoscope search to
see if I can track its route to the beach.

04:07.695 --> 04:08.735
So we don't have anything?

04:08.896 --> 04:10.728
And no one's claimed
responsibility yet?

04:10.898 --> 04:12.866
Actually, this just aired
two minutes ago.

04:13.368 --> 04:14.392
Sources have confirmed

04:14.569 --> 04:19.473
the Iran-based Islamic militant group
Jihadist Liberation Front, or JLF,

04:19.640 --> 04:23.008
is responsible for this morning's
horrific Venice Beach attack,

04:23.177 --> 04:24.645
killing two and injuring dozens.

04:24.812 --> 04:27.543
That's Dana Steele. She does
the "Nerves of Steele” segment

04:27.715 --> 04:29.809
where she ventures
into dangerous situations.

04:29.984 --> 04:32.214
Her tagline is,
"Anything for the story.”

04:33.187 --> 04:36.020
She graduated early
from Columbia School of Journalism.

04:36.591 --> 04:38.958
Runner-up for the duPont Award
for digital journalism,

04:39.127 --> 04:40.561
and a host of other accolades.

04:40.728 --> 04:43.220
- Smart and ambitious.
- Try the other outlets, Eric.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.335
Hold on, Pamela.
Just getting this update right now.

04:48.503 --> 04:51.803
It is being reported
that the Jihadist Liberation Front

04:51.973 --> 04:53.941
masterminded
this morning's deadly attack.

04:54.108 --> 04:56.338
Saturday morning's attack
on a military charity event

04:56.511 --> 04:57.706
was carried out by the JLF.

04:57.879 --> 04:59.074
One dead and multiple injured

04:59.247 --> 05:02.080
was carried out
by the Jihadist Liberation Front.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.513
Domino effect.

05:03.684 --> 05:05.618
Other stations
are picking up her story.

05:05.787 --> 05:09.451
Homeland's been tracking
a JLF cell in L.A. for months.

05:09.624 --> 05:10.944
It's time they share their intel.

05:11.092 --> 05:14.289
Eric, plug us in to the FBI checkpoints.
Get a team scrubbing surveillance.

05:14.462 --> 05:16.302
We're looking for
three men traveling together.

05:16.464 --> 05:17.795
Kensi, Deeks, Homeland Security.

05:17.965 --> 05:20.195
- Let's find out what they know.
- Copy that.

05:20.368 --> 05:23.998
- How many injured, Eric?
- Last count, 29.

05:24.172 --> 05:25.469
Seven of them children.

05:40.288 --> 05:42.450
Job's never done.

05:45.493 --> 05:48.428
Will it ever be, Owen?

05:49.397 --> 05:52.389
They'll keep popping up,
and we'll keep knocking them down.

05:52.567 --> 05:54.729
This was different.

05:55.970 --> 05:57.734
How do you figure?

05:58.406 --> 06:00.636
We missed it.

06:05.246 --> 06:06.475
Well, it's not the first time.

06:07.648 --> 06:08.809
No.

06:14.522 --> 06:16.889
Do you still flinch

06:17.058 --> 06:19.493
when you hear jets fly over the city?

06:19.660 --> 06:21.651
Yeah. Don't you?

06:23.831 --> 06:27.495
Unfortunately, we can't choose
the place where they attack us.

06:27.668 --> 06:30.069
No, we can't.

06:32.974 --> 06:35.841
Are you ready for another round?

06:37.044 --> 06:39.536
I will fight from beyond the grave.

06:41.182 --> 06:42.809
One thing's for certain.

06:42.984 --> 06:45.351
Foreign, domestic,

06:45.520 --> 06:50.458
they picked the wrong city
to mess with.

06:53.094 --> 06:54.974
My daughter didn't have
a recital in the Valley,

06:55.129 --> 06:57.291
I'd have been right here
with my family.

07:05.172 --> 07:07.607
This could have been my little girl's.

07:16.484 --> 07:19.215
Detonation velocity
was near top of the scale.

07:19.387 --> 07:22.015
I'm thinking military-grade
explosives.

07:22.356 --> 07:23.983
HMX, maybe.

07:24.158 --> 07:25.751
Ten, 15 pounds.

07:26.327 --> 07:29.092
It's not exactly the kind of thing
you just pick up at Home Depot.

07:29.263 --> 07:30.753
Definitely not.

07:30.932 --> 07:31.956
- Eric.
- Callen.

07:32.133 --> 07:33.225
Any updates?

07:33.401 --> 07:35.267
We're still checking. Nothing yet.

07:35.436 --> 07:36.460
Okay.

07:36.637 --> 07:37.661
- Hey.
- Yeah.

07:37.838 --> 07:40.330
Run down any leads
on missing HMX explosives.

07:40.508 --> 07:41.566
That's military-grade.

07:41.742 --> 07:43.642
- Right.
- You got it.

07:44.612 --> 07:47.547
Hey, they had to slip up
at some point.

07:48.149 --> 07:50.675
We just need to find out where.

07:50.851 --> 07:52.250
Tell us about the JLF.

07:52.420 --> 07:54.889
Also known as
Jihadist Liberation Front.

07:55.056 --> 07:56.524
More an army than a front.

07:56.691 --> 07:59.626
We estimate they number
almost a hundred thousand.

07:59.794 --> 08:01.728
They are known for
suicide bombings,

08:02.263 --> 08:04.960
kidnappings
and targeted assassinations.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.326
We've been on this L.A. cell
for the last year.

08:09.503 --> 08:12.234
Wiretaps, hidden cameras,
laser mics, you name it.

08:12.406 --> 08:14.431
So you got a full workup
going on these guys.

08:14.609 --> 08:16.202
They blink, we log it.

08:16.377 --> 08:17.857
Anything related to the attack today?

08:18.012 --> 08:21.880
Other than pizza and porn, these guys
have been dormant for the last year.

08:22.049 --> 08:24.313
I'm talking zero activity.

08:25.119 --> 08:26.883
ZNN is reporting otherwise.

08:27.922 --> 08:30.152
We're deep in their network.

08:30.324 --> 08:32.918
I wish I could tell you different,
but these guys didn't do it.

08:46.573 --> 08:48.439
- Thanks.
- Yes, sir.

08:50.377 --> 08:52.277
FBI recovered part of the detonator.

08:52.446 --> 08:54.710
Looks like the bomb
was remotely activated.

08:54.881 --> 08:55.905
Probably by cell phone.

08:56.083 --> 09:00.042
They're also gathering any photos
and videos they can from tourists.

09:00.220 --> 09:01.745
Maybe we can put together
a timeline.

09:04.091 --> 09:05.286
Yeah, Kens.

09:05.459 --> 09:08.554
Homeland says JLF
is not responsible for the attack.

09:09.096 --> 09:10.962
- They on point?
- Intel looks solid.

09:11.131 --> 09:13.259
But there's more.
Reports are starting to roll in.

09:13.433 --> 09:15.393
Every small group
trying to make a name for itself

09:15.535 --> 09:17.526
is now claiming responsibility
for the bombing.

09:17.704 --> 09:19.194
All right, thanks, guys.

09:19.806 --> 09:20.932
It's getting out of control.

09:22.009 --> 09:23.807
Time to talk to the media.

09:23.977 --> 09:26.844
Venice Beach, residential paradise,
tourist destination.

09:27.014 --> 09:28.880
And now, terrorist target.

09:29.049 --> 09:30.642
This is Dana Steele reporting.

09:31.852 --> 09:33.513
How was that, Bobby?

09:33.687 --> 09:34.882
Dana Steele?

09:36.290 --> 09:37.917
Uh, that's me. And you are?

09:38.292 --> 09:40.761
NCIS. Agent Callen, Agent Hanna.

09:40.927 --> 09:42.725
Turn the camera off,
rewind and delete.

09:44.731 --> 09:47.098
- Little busy, fellas. Got a job to do.
- So do we.

09:47.267 --> 09:49.827
You reported JLF
was responsible for the bombing.

09:50.003 --> 09:51.971
- What's your proof?
- My sources.

09:52.139 --> 09:53.971
Yeah? We're gonna need names.

09:54.474 --> 09:55.635
Not possible.

09:55.809 --> 09:57.402
I give up a source,
I lose them forever.

09:57.577 --> 09:59.568
My rights are protected
under the First Amendment.

09:59.746 --> 10:02.010
You're protected by Marines
who were killed and injured.

10:02.182 --> 10:04.480
You'd rather protect a terrorist
who took American lives?

10:04.651 --> 10:07.177
To get to the truth, you sometimes
have to dance with the devil.

10:07.354 --> 10:09.118
Sounds like a pretty good way
to get burned.

10:09.456 --> 10:10.946
Only if you're afraid of the heat.

10:11.391 --> 10:13.120
Anything for a story, right?

10:13.293 --> 10:14.658
Including selling your soul.

10:15.862 --> 10:17.830
I have a right to protect my sources.

10:17.998 --> 10:19.989
You also have the right
to remain silent.

10:21.902 --> 10:23.702
The California Shield Law
protects journalists

10:23.837 --> 10:25.498
who wanna keep
their sources confidential.

10:25.672 --> 10:27.197
And the Patriot Act doesn't.

10:28.642 --> 10:32.203
Now, you can come with us
and willingly answer some questions,

10:32.379 --> 10:33.979
or we can go
through the proper channels.

10:34.147 --> 10:35.979
While you wait in a holding cell

10:36.650 --> 10:39.210
and every one of these other reporters
gets ahead on the story.

10:42.656 --> 10:44.715
Fine. Bobby, call the office.

10:44.891 --> 10:46.359
Yeah.

10:46.526 --> 10:47.891
This way.

10:49.429 --> 10:52.922
I have credible sources all over the
world that have never let me down.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.831
Well, our sources say
that it's not the JLF.

10:56.002 --> 10:59.199
Who? Couple of sleep-deprived cops
on a wiretap?

11:01.942 --> 11:05.207
Just so you understand,
this is a matter of national security.

11:05.379 --> 11:07.006
You willing to go to prison over this?

11:07.180 --> 11:08.648
I wouldn't be the first.

11:08.815 --> 11:10.249
Okay. Look.

11:11.651 --> 11:14.348
I understand your
journalistic code of ethics.

11:14.521 --> 11:17.491
But don't let it stop them
from getting their justice.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.395
Who's your contact?

11:31.638 --> 11:33.106
There's a guy I've used for years.

11:33.273 --> 11:35.605
Used to run relief through Somalia.

11:35.776 --> 11:37.540
He knows someone. I trust him.

11:37.711 --> 11:39.076
Need a name, Dana.

11:44.217 --> 11:45.742
Merle Jarvis.

11:45.919 --> 11:47.614
But you don't find him.

11:47.788 --> 11:48.949
He finds you.

11:49.122 --> 11:50.612
Let us worry about that.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.727
We'll see who can't find who.

12:04.538 --> 12:06.370
- Eric.
- What's up, Callen?

12:06.540 --> 12:08.440
Run the name Merle Jarvis for me.

12:08.608 --> 12:10.702
Look for any connections
to Dana Steele.

12:10.877 --> 12:12.345
Okay. I'll get it.

12:12.512 --> 12:16.471
Hey, guys, I got a lead on the
meter maid car from the bombing.

12:16.650 --> 12:17.674
It wasn't easy.

12:17.851 --> 12:20.650
It's a salvage vehicle that shouldn't
have even been on the road.

12:20.821 --> 12:24.280
Its chain of ownership leads
to a mom-and-pop shop.

12:24.825 --> 12:26.384
Quick Step Car Rental.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.393
- Thanks, Eric. Send us the address.
- Just did.

12:30.330 --> 12:31.695
Okay, Merle Jarvis.

12:31.865 --> 12:33.959
He used to run
Global Salvation Solutions,

12:34.134 --> 12:37.434
provides international relief
in the Middle East.

12:37.604 --> 12:40.767
Interesting. There's no indication
why he left the company.

12:41.775 --> 12:43.709
He's been off the grid since 2008.

12:43.877 --> 12:46.539
His last known address
is in Arizona.

12:46.713 --> 12:49.011
So I guess we're gonna have to try
a different route.

12:54.321 --> 12:55.345
Hey.

12:56.223 --> 12:58.214
What's up? Are you okay?

13:01.595 --> 13:03.689
When those people woke up,

13:04.130 --> 13:07.191
they didn't know
this was the last morning they'd see.

13:08.468 --> 13:11.028
Yeah, I know.
It's been getting to me too.

13:12.172 --> 13:14.903
If you don't tell someone
how you feel about them,

13:15.075 --> 13:16.668
you may never get the chance.

13:17.244 --> 13:18.575
You're right.

13:18.745 --> 13:22.306
People should just put it out there
while they can.

13:31.858 --> 13:34.122
What you doing over there?

13:34.294 --> 13:36.023
Putting it out there while I can.

13:37.330 --> 13:38.820
Okay.

13:38.999 --> 13:40.330
I'm game.

13:55.749 --> 13:57.911
We don't talk about this.

13:58.084 --> 13:59.142
Agreed?

14:00.153 --> 14:01.348
Agreed.

14:01.521 --> 14:02.989
Ready?

14:05.692 --> 14:07.091
Go.

14:16.202 --> 14:17.260
Heh.

14:19.573 --> 14:20.836
Oh, got a hit.

14:21.007 --> 14:22.771
Whatever you got better be good.

14:22.943 --> 14:25.241
I got an address for Merle Jarvis.

14:25.412 --> 14:27.403
Uh, Dana Steele's source.

14:27.581 --> 14:30.778
So it looks like
Global Salvation Solutions

14:30.951 --> 14:34.581
still covers his medical insurance.
There's a bungalow in Mid-Wilshire

14:34.754 --> 14:37.121
belonging to one Missy Campbell,

14:37.290 --> 14:38.553
maiden name Jarvis.

14:38.725 --> 14:40.022
All right.

14:40.193 --> 14:41.752
Give it to Kensi and Deeks.

14:41.928 --> 14:43.418
Yep. Will do.

14:50.003 --> 14:52.404
Is there something going on
that I should know about?

14:54.274 --> 14:57.244
No. Nothing to know about.

14:57.410 --> 14:58.900
That you need to know about.

14:59.813 --> 15:02.043
- Nell?
- No.

15:02.215 --> 15:03.808
Okay.

15:03.984 --> 15:05.418
Okay.

15:14.461 --> 15:15.929
Teal.

15:16.429 --> 15:18.693
That's a bold choice, huh?

15:18.865 --> 15:21.732
What's going on with you? You've
been sulking since Sunset Boulevard.

15:21.901 --> 15:22.925
I was a Marine brat.

15:23.103 --> 15:26.103
Used to go to events like that all the
time. Just close to home, that's all.

15:26.239 --> 15:27.764
Kensi, we're gonna hit these guys.

15:27.941 --> 15:29.670
Damn right.

15:34.381 --> 15:35.610
Can I help you?

15:37.083 --> 15:39.450
Uh, yeah, I'm Detective Marty Deeks,
L.AP.D.

15:39.619 --> 15:42.816
This is Special Agent Kensi Blye,
NCIS.

15:42.989 --> 15:44.423
You're here about the bombing.

15:44.591 --> 15:45.956
Come in.

15:46.126 --> 15:47.252
Come in.

15:48.828 --> 15:50.353
Thank you.

15:51.464 --> 15:54.058
Hold on, Pamela.
Just getting this update right now.

15:54.234 --> 15:57.329
It is being reported
that the Jihadist Liberation Front

15:57.504 --> 15:59.768
masterminded
this morning's deadly attack.

16:01.041 --> 16:04.477
- The group, also known as JLF...
- This is a tragedy.

16:04.644 --> 16:07.511
I hope you can apprehend
the responsible party.

16:07.681 --> 16:10.150
Mr. Jarvis, how did you confirm
the JLF's involvement?

16:10.316 --> 16:14.378
My company moved medical aid
through Somalia and Iran.

16:14.554 --> 16:16.386
To do so, we...

16:16.556 --> 16:19.582
We had to grease a lot of palms

16:19.759 --> 16:21.693
just to get
a shipment through at times.

16:21.861 --> 16:23.556
Any of those contacts call you?

16:23.730 --> 16:24.822
Reach out to you?

16:24.998 --> 16:26.397
Someone who can
confirm the claim?

16:26.566 --> 16:30.059
We had to forge
some toxic relationships

16:30.236 --> 16:32.830
with more than a few
nefarious characters.

16:33.006 --> 16:34.269
That's really interesting.

16:34.441 --> 16:38.708
But do you have any solid confirmation
the JLF is responsible for this attack?

16:40.113 --> 16:41.911
They see it all.

16:42.082 --> 16:44.574
We are like ants on an ant farm.

16:44.751 --> 16:45.775
"They" who?

16:47.120 --> 16:48.349
Them.

16:49.923 --> 16:51.550
"Them" who?

16:51.725 --> 16:53.819
Are you pointing north?

16:53.993 --> 16:55.392
- Yes.
- What do you mean?

16:55.562 --> 16:59.430
Like north, Valley,
or north, Canada?

17:01.801 --> 17:03.496
True north.

17:04.671 --> 17:06.435
How do you know Dana Steele?

17:09.642 --> 17:10.665
She's one of them.

17:10.844 --> 17:12.710
She's one of the
Jihadist Liberation Front?

17:12.878 --> 17:14.210
No.

17:16.049 --> 17:17.073
Them.

17:19.953 --> 17:21.546
Are we talking about aliens?

17:24.057 --> 17:25.582
They're everywhere.

17:25.759 --> 17:26.920
- Thank you.
- Al right.

17:31.131 --> 17:32.530
Wow, so that happened.

17:33.399 --> 17:36.164
Source, my ass.
Dana Steele screwed us.

17:36.336 --> 17:38.532
Just wasted an hour of our day.

17:38.705 --> 17:40.730
So, what's she hiding?

17:52.318 --> 17:54.685
Heh. Look at this.

17:54.854 --> 17:57.585
It should be illegal
to mistreat cars this way.

17:57.757 --> 18:00.249
- Salvaged or not, it's terrible.
- Yep.

18:00.426 --> 18:02.918
It's bad car-ma.

18:05.265 --> 18:08.530
That was as bad as these cars look.

18:08.701 --> 18:11.398
- I mean, look at this piece of...
- Art, right?

18:11.805 --> 18:14.467
Well, if the color offends you,
there's plenty more to choose from.

18:14.974 --> 18:16.567
Come on in.

18:24.818 --> 18:26.115
How can I help you guys?

18:26.286 --> 18:27.412
Federal agents.

18:27.587 --> 18:29.681
You can start by showing us
your rental logs.

18:30.557 --> 18:31.581
What's this about?

18:31.758 --> 18:33.419
The bombing today in Venice.

18:34.060 --> 18:35.084
Terrible.

18:35.261 --> 18:36.422
But why are you here?

18:36.596 --> 18:40.760
We have reason to believe that one
of your salvaged vehicles was involved.

18:41.301 --> 18:44.066
Well, it's not against the law
to rent a salvaged vehicle.

18:44.237 --> 18:45.957
Actually, it is,
but we're not here for you.

18:46.105 --> 18:47.766
We just want to take a look
at your logs.

18:49.509 --> 18:51.034
Well, you're gonna need a warrant.

18:52.846 --> 18:54.644
You know, there's a theory that

18:54.814 --> 18:58.546
had those cars been properly salvaged,
this wouldn't have happened today,

18:58.718 --> 19:01.813
placing the blame
squarely on the owner.

19:02.255 --> 19:05.486
Years of probing investigations.

19:06.226 --> 19:08.524
The FBI will have a field day
proving that theory.

19:08.695 --> 19:11.562
- Not to mention...
- Okay, I get it.

19:11.731 --> 19:14.701
- What do you need?
- Rental logs.

19:15.034 --> 19:18.231
Only because you asked so nicely.

19:22.942 --> 19:24.637
Seriously?

19:25.311 --> 19:26.403
Handwritten logs?

19:26.579 --> 19:28.240
No photocopies? No IDs?

19:29.115 --> 19:32.517
White Civic. Right there.
Computers are expensive.

19:32.986 --> 19:35.648
Nothing wrong with
good old pen and pad.

19:36.055 --> 19:38.888
Let me guess, they paid cash.

19:40.059 --> 19:41.720
Eric, I need you to run a DMV check

19:41.895 --> 19:44.592
on a license I just sent you
for a Richard James.

19:44.764 --> 19:46.323
Running it.

19:47.066 --> 19:49.364
Sorry, guys, but it's a fake.

19:52.438 --> 19:54.167
It's bogus.

19:54.641 --> 19:56.040
Surprise.

19:56.376 --> 19:58.003
That mean I'm not gonna get
my cars back?

20:01.681 --> 20:03.115
What do you mean "cars"?

20:03.283 --> 20:05.911
Those guys. They rented three cars.

20:06.085 --> 20:10.716
A white Civic, a copper Hyundai
and a gray Subaru.

20:12.558 --> 20:14.026
Three cars.

20:15.295 --> 20:17.263
Two more attacks.

20:26.839 --> 20:29.171
Three cars.
One at Venice, two unaccounted for.

20:29.341 --> 20:30.968
We're running
a Kaleidoscope search now.

20:31.143 --> 20:33.635
Cross-referencing FBI, CIA
and Homeland databases

20:33.812 --> 20:35.372
to make sure
we haven't missed anything.

20:35.514 --> 20:37.846
- All right.
- These guys hit a military charity event.

20:38.017 --> 20:39.777
The car was in place
hours before it started.

20:39.919 --> 20:41.919
If they planned multiple attacks
at similar events,

20:42.087 --> 20:43.577
those cars could already be in place.

20:43.756 --> 20:46.020
Make sure all public military events
are canceled.

20:46.191 --> 20:47.784
On it immediately.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.759
Granger. Kensi and Deeks?

20:50.930 --> 20:52.694
Checking out a military contractor

20:52.865 --> 20:55.562
who reported missing HMX
two weeks ago.

20:55.734 --> 20:57.224
ATF started an investigation,

20:57.403 --> 20:59.997
but they had nothing to go on
until this morning happened.

21:00.172 --> 21:02.937
- What about Dana Steele?
- ZNN is standing behind her.

21:03.108 --> 21:04.598
They're just saving face.

21:05.077 --> 21:07.774
Doesn't change the fact
that she sent us to talk to a wack job.

21:08.213 --> 21:09.772
But why?

21:09.949 --> 21:12.043
Because you can't put
the genie back in the bottle.

21:12.217 --> 21:14.345
Everyone thinks JLF is responsible.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.045
And she takes the credit.

21:16.956 --> 21:18.117
Let's get her back in here.

21:18.591 --> 21:21.151
- Ping her phone if you have to.
- We tagged her at the boatshed.

21:21.293 --> 21:22.419
Nell's been tracking her.

21:22.595 --> 21:25.530
So far, she's only been interviewing
families of the blast victims.

21:25.698 --> 21:27.359
Even better.

21:27.866 --> 21:29.527
Have at it.

21:31.670 --> 21:33.870
They disabled the alarm
before they forced their way in.

21:34.006 --> 21:36.373
And took off with the HMIX
before anyone could respond.

21:36.542 --> 21:37.902
So they knew what they were doing.

21:38.043 --> 21:39.704
And exactly
what they were looking for.

21:39.878 --> 21:41.812
- Anything like this ever happen before?
- Never.

21:41.981 --> 21:44.006
And I've been working here
since 2007.

21:44.183 --> 21:45.703
Who had access
to the delivery invoices

21:45.851 --> 21:47.571
and who else knew
that you were storing HMX?

21:47.720 --> 21:49.984
Nobody but me.
Never know who you can trust.

21:50.155 --> 21:52.146
Especially with something
as dangerous as HMX.

21:52.324 --> 21:55.157
So they disabled the alarms,
what about security cameras?

21:55.327 --> 21:57.853
I thought you might want to see this.

22:06.505 --> 22:08.633
Looks like the three guys
from the Venice bombing.

22:09.041 --> 22:10.236
It's crazy.

22:10.409 --> 22:12.707
We got millions of dollars
worth of inventory in here.

22:12.878 --> 22:15.404
And all they took
is five tubes of HMX.

22:15.581 --> 22:16.673
How much is in each tube?

22:17.216 --> 22:18.650
About 20 pounds.

22:18.817 --> 22:21.343
Bomb squad thinks
the Venice blast only took 15 pounds.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.454
Which means they have
about four tubes left.

22:23.622 --> 22:26.353
- Enough to take down a building.
- A building?

22:26.525 --> 22:28.755
Hell, that's enough
to take out a city block.

22:30.396 --> 22:32.728
- I'll call Hetty.
- Yeah.

22:38.103 --> 22:40.435
- Where's Dana Steele, Eric?
- You're close.

22:40.606 --> 22:43.234
According to the tracker, she's
inside the Grand Central Market.

22:43.409 --> 22:46.674
Yeah? Well, we're looking right
inside the Grand Central Market.

22:47.079 --> 22:48.843
It's like trying to find Waldo.

22:49.014 --> 22:50.209
Who's Waldo?

22:51.016 --> 22:53.212
Where's Waldo? The kids book?

22:53.619 --> 22:56.520
He's like a goofy kid
with a red and white striped shirt.

22:56.689 --> 22:59.124
- You don't know Waldo?
- Sounds very patriotic.

22:59.858 --> 23:02.452
Look, this story
is a big break for Dana.

23:02.628 --> 23:04.687
She may be able to parlay this
into an anchor desk.

23:04.863 --> 23:07.264
Yeah, thanks to a terrorist attack
on American soil.

23:07.433 --> 23:10.095
Every journalist owes tribute
to the evil one.

23:10.269 --> 23:11.669
What's that, one of Hetty's quotes?

23:11.837 --> 23:15.273
Jean de La Fontaine,
17th-century French poet.

23:15.441 --> 23:18.308
You know 17th-century French poets,
but you don't know Waldo?

23:18.477 --> 23:21.276
Back to my point,
this is the biggest story of her life.

23:22.781 --> 23:24.215
Hey.

23:25.117 --> 23:26.881
So why is she here
without her crew?

23:27.453 --> 23:30.218
Meeting in a crowded public place.

23:30.622 --> 23:32.215
Maybe he's her real source.

23:32.391 --> 23:34.416
No, no, you must. You have to.

23:34.593 --> 23:36.061
Let it go. It's too late.

23:36.228 --> 23:38.094
- I'm not doing it. Aah!
- Federal agents!

23:38.263 --> 23:39.822
He's got a knife.

23:52.878 --> 23:54.175
Hey!

24:09.128 --> 24:11.859
- She gonna make it?
- She's gone.

24:35.387 --> 24:37.685
Why'd you kill Dana Steele?

24:37.856 --> 24:39.221
My name is Bakri Deng.

24:39.391 --> 24:40.620
I'm from South Sudan.

24:40.792 --> 24:42.920
I detonated the bomb.

24:47.298 --> 24:48.732
Where are the other two cars?

24:49.167 --> 24:50.760
My name is Bakri Deng.

24:50.935 --> 24:52.198
I'm from South Sudan.

24:52.370 --> 24:53.701
I detonated the bomb.

24:53.872 --> 24:55.533
Where are the rest
of the explosives?

24:59.411 --> 25:01.175
You were asked a question.

25:02.981 --> 25:04.278
My name is Bakri Deng.

25:04.449 --> 25:05.678
I'm from South Sudan.

25:05.850 --> 25:07.750
I detonated the bomb.

25:12.991 --> 25:14.425
Let's go from the top.

25:17.362 --> 25:19.421
Why'd you kill Dana Steele?

25:19.597 --> 25:20.996
My name is Bakri Deng.

25:21.166 --> 25:22.361
I'm from South Sudan.

25:22.534 --> 25:24.525
I detonated the bomb.

25:26.604 --> 25:30.905
As he is apt to say,
the man's name is Bakri Deng.

25:31.409 --> 25:35.039
He came here from
South Sudan four years ago.

25:35.213 --> 25:36.237
Legally?

25:36.414 --> 25:38.746
He's paid taxes ever since.

25:38.917 --> 25:40.385
Do we know what he's doing here?

25:40.552 --> 25:45.114
He was a chemistry professor
at the University of Khartoum.

25:45.290 --> 25:46.917
And now?

25:48.460 --> 25:50.929
He's washing dishes, apparently.

25:51.095 --> 25:53.621
At the W Hotel.

25:53.798 --> 25:59.396
Martini glasses, Collins glasses,
rocks glasses.

26:01.406 --> 26:04.398
Everyone's drinking
old-fashioneds again.

26:04.576 --> 26:06.806
Like bleating sheep.

26:08.780 --> 26:10.441
The more things change...

26:10.615 --> 26:12.481
The more work
we have ahead of us.

26:17.889 --> 26:19.823
So I guess the man came prepared.

26:19.991 --> 26:22.153
Well, we're not giving up.
We just need another angle.

26:22.694 --> 26:24.184
Anything from Kensi and Deeks?

26:24.362 --> 26:28.128
They're on their way to his apartment,
warrant in hand.

26:28.566 --> 26:30.660
He can't just be stalling us.

26:30.835 --> 26:32.269
What's this guy's play?

26:32.437 --> 26:33.700
To that point, Mr. Hanna,

26:33.872 --> 26:38.207
why has this man done any
of the things he's done today?

26:52.624 --> 26:54.888
Doesn't exactly scream terrorist den.

26:55.059 --> 26:56.499
Maybe I should get
an apartment here.

26:56.661 --> 26:59.722
You'll never move. You'd have to
pack up all your hoarding things.

26:59.898 --> 27:01.858
- That would take an entire week.
- Weeks, plural.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.559
Plus, moving takes lots of boxes.

27:03.735 --> 27:05.225
Ooh. Poor trees.

27:05.403 --> 27:06.723
Mm-hm. We both know that you kill

27:06.871 --> 27:09.340
every tree, plant and flower
that you touch.

27:09.507 --> 27:11.498
Okay, I meant in theory.

27:11.676 --> 27:13.576
Plus, I've stopped buying them,
okay?

27:15.246 --> 27:17.578
After I kill the next orchid,
I'll stop buying them.

27:20.919 --> 27:23.081
I'm gonna die alone
in my apartment.

27:23.721 --> 27:25.621
You're such a lady.

27:25.790 --> 27:26.814
Federal agents.

27:50.348 --> 27:51.838
Clear.

27:53.885 --> 27:54.909
Clear.

28:01.793 --> 28:03.056
Look at you, making your bed

28:03.227 --> 28:05.719
before going out and killing
innocent people.

28:15.073 --> 28:16.632
- Hey, Kens?
- Yeah?

28:19.410 --> 28:22.311
I think Bakri left a family
back in South Sudan.

28:23.081 --> 28:24.549
Hey, take a look at this.

28:24.716 --> 28:26.411
What do you got?

28:31.222 --> 28:32.587
Letter writing campaign.

28:33.291 --> 28:35.316
With Bakri's signature
and two others.

28:35.493 --> 28:36.892
Probably his two roommates.

28:37.061 --> 28:38.790
Those three guys in the video.

28:38.963 --> 28:40.089
Who were they writing to?

28:40.698 --> 28:43.724
State Department,
congressmen, celebrities,

28:43.901 --> 28:45.460
Red Cross,
guys who started Google.

28:46.170 --> 28:48.434
- Anybody who could help.
- Help with what?

28:48.606 --> 28:50.540
Sending aid to South Sudan.

28:50.708 --> 28:54.235
Water, food, blankets
for the displaced families.

28:54.946 --> 28:56.004
Look at this.

28:58.249 --> 29:00.149
Looks like they've been
at this for years.

29:00.318 --> 29:03.083
Evidently.
Looks like a peaceful mission.

29:03.254 --> 29:05.086
So, what changed?

29:05.256 --> 29:06.690
And where are his roommates?

29:10.094 --> 29:11.118
Go ahead, Nell.

29:11.295 --> 29:13.161
The photo you sent
is of Bakri's wife,

29:13.331 --> 29:15.732
a graduate student
at the University of Khartoum,

29:15.900 --> 29:17.925
and their two small children.

29:18.102 --> 29:19.536
Are they also in the States?

29:19.704 --> 29:22.173
No. They were denied their visas.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.206
So why did Bakri
come without them?

29:24.375 --> 29:27.436
Because in 2010, Sudan's president,
Hassan al-Bashir,

29:27.612 --> 29:29.512
declared the war in Darfur over.

29:29.681 --> 29:30.876
But over it was not.

29:31.049 --> 29:32.642
Bashir signed
a cease-fire agreement

29:32.817 --> 29:34.285
with one South Sudanese
rebel group,

29:34.452 --> 29:37.387
only to attack another one.
The violence never stopped.

29:37.555 --> 29:39.546
After that, Bakri took action.

29:39.724 --> 29:42.284
He wrote a letter of resignation
to the university.

29:42.460 --> 29:44.827
Saying he was coming to America
in search of aid.

29:44.996 --> 29:46.521
Yeah, how did you know that?

29:46.698 --> 29:48.359
Because Bakri kept his word.

29:48.533 --> 29:50.934
He's been writing letters
to raise awareness for the conflict

29:51.102 --> 29:52.862
and help his displaced
countrymen ever since.

29:53.004 --> 29:54.324
But we don't know why he stopped.

29:54.472 --> 29:55.906
Actually, I think we do.

29:56.307 --> 29:58.332
A month ago,
another surge of violence

29:58.509 --> 30:01.570
displaced 50,000 more
South Sudanese from their homes.

30:01.746 --> 30:04.340
Students in Khartoum
staged a peaceful protest

30:04.515 --> 30:09.077
that turned extremely non-peaceful
when police opened fire on them.

30:09.253 --> 30:11.051
Bakri's wife and children were killed.

30:11.222 --> 30:13.850
And that's when he put down the pen
and picked up a sword.

30:14.025 --> 30:17.051
So if this is about Darfur,
why attack Los Angeles?

30:17.628 --> 30:20.120
And why kill a news reporter?

30:20.732 --> 30:22.598
That's a damn good question.

30:24.736 --> 30:26.534
How you holding up, Bakri?

30:26.704 --> 30:28.194
Need some water?

30:28.372 --> 30:29.932
- My name is Bakri Deng...
- Bakri Deng.

30:30.041 --> 30:32.442
You're from South Sudan.
You detonated the bomb.

30:32.610 --> 30:33.907
And we know why.

30:38.683 --> 30:42.449
Bakri, I also have a family.

30:44.956 --> 30:46.651
Beautiful wife.

30:46.824 --> 30:48.952
Beautiful daughter.

30:49.127 --> 30:51.027
I'd do anything to protect them.

30:51.195 --> 30:53.527
- My name is Bakri Deng...
- We read your letters.

30:54.332 --> 30:56.767
You tried to get our attention
a different way.

30:56.934 --> 31:00.893
But after they killed your family,
you had to yell louder.

31:04.275 --> 31:05.902
I needed to make you listen.

31:06.077 --> 31:07.841
We're listening now.

31:08.613 --> 31:12.572
My people need
water, food, protection.

31:12.750 --> 31:14.149
But you Americans,

31:14.318 --> 31:17.015
do you ever think about
how blessed you are to be born here,

31:17.188 --> 31:19.782
and not a place where the fear
of death is part of everyday life?

31:20.391 --> 31:24.589
Is that why you did this?
To show us what that feels like?

31:27.131 --> 31:28.462
I did what is done.

31:28.633 --> 31:31.625
Bakri, what happened
with the reporter?

31:32.170 --> 31:34.332
I never intended to kill her.

31:34.505 --> 31:37.099
But when I went to her with the truth,
she was so stubborn,

31:37.275 --> 31:39.642
so concerned
about how it would make her look.

31:39.811 --> 31:43.145
You went to her with proof that you
were responsible for the bombing

31:43.314 --> 31:44.804
and she wouldn't change her story?

31:44.982 --> 31:46.006
Definitive proof.

31:46.184 --> 31:48.915
She wanted me to say
I supported some other cause.

31:49.086 --> 31:50.952
- The JLF?
- Yes.

31:51.122 --> 31:52.612
She didn't want to admit
she's wrong.

31:52.790 --> 31:56.158
And America needs to know that you,
Bakri Deng from South Sudan,

31:56.327 --> 31:57.761
set off that bomb this morning.

31:57.929 --> 32:00.955
Exactly. Exactly. Now you see.

32:01.132 --> 32:02.827
Now America has to intervene.

32:03.601 --> 32:05.330
You got a point. It's worked before.

32:05.503 --> 32:07.403
Al Qaeda bombed our Twin Towers,

32:07.572 --> 32:10.132
we couldn't send troops
to Afghanistan fast enough.

32:10.308 --> 32:13.938
You believe U.S. troops on the ground
in South Sudan will end the conflict?

32:14.111 --> 32:17.411
But the plan doesn't work if a reporter is
saying someone else set off the bomb.

32:17.582 --> 32:19.949
Which is why I had to make her
change her story.

32:20.117 --> 32:21.881
And it definitely doesn't work
if she's dead,

32:22.053 --> 32:24.385
and the news cycle
is still focused on the JLF.

32:24.856 --> 32:27.791
Right. So you stage another attack.

32:28.359 --> 32:31.727
Bigger, bolder.

32:32.230 --> 32:35.461
- We have no choice.
- You always have a choice, Bakri.

32:36.033 --> 32:38.365
Where are the other two cars?

32:42.273 --> 32:44.139
You don't want any more blood
on your hands.

32:45.142 --> 32:47.440
Stay the man
your wife and kids loved.

32:47.612 --> 32:49.410
What does it matter?
They are gone.

32:49.580 --> 32:51.241
But you're here.

32:52.383 --> 32:54.263
It's up to you to decide
if you're any different

32:54.418 --> 32:56.580
from the men who killed your family.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.685
The cars are going downtown.

33:04.862 --> 33:07.229
- My roommates are taking them there.
- Where?

33:08.399 --> 33:11.334
The high-rise on the corner
of Wilshire and Whitland.

33:14.805 --> 33:17.645
That's where the State Department's
Los Angeles field office is located.

33:17.775 --> 33:19.243
You've been sending letters there.

33:21.379 --> 33:23.871
- When is this happening?
- Now.

33:27.852 --> 33:29.479
You'll help me

33:29.654 --> 33:31.383
in exchange for my cooperation?

33:33.157 --> 33:34.784
You're Bakri Deng.

33:34.959 --> 33:36.085
You detonated the bomb.

33:36.627 --> 33:39.688
You'll get the credit you want,
just like you deserve.

33:49.740 --> 33:51.936
- Go.
- Eric, cars and explosives are headed

33:52.109 --> 33:53.838
to a high-rise
at Wilshire and Whitland.

33:54.011 --> 33:56.378
And call building security
and tell them to evacuate.

33:56.547 --> 33:58.140
- Good thing it's a Saturday.
- Will do.

33:58.316 --> 34:01.775
I'm also sending ID photos of Bakri's
two roommates to your phones.

34:01.953 --> 34:05.321
Get those to the FBI, L.A.P.D. and
Homeland Security while you're at it.

34:05.489 --> 34:08.481
Ill tell Kensi and Deeks
to meet you at the high-rise.

34:08.659 --> 34:10.388
Gentlemen.

34:10.561 --> 34:12.757
Come back in one piece.

34:36.253 --> 34:37.947
Talk to me, Eric. What do we got?

34:38.121 --> 34:40.081
The building has a
closed-circuit security system.

34:40.657 --> 34:41.818
So we're going in blind?

34:41.992 --> 34:44.085
Unfortunately, yes.

34:44.261 --> 34:46.127
This building
would meet earthquake codes,

34:46.830 --> 34:49.764
which means it rests on
shock absorbers filled with oil.

34:49.933 --> 34:51.297
Flammable oil.

34:51.467 --> 34:53.436
Really? Eighty-five pounds
of HMX wasn't enough?

34:53.603 --> 34:56.004
- It's totally overkill.
- Have you cleared the building?

34:56.172 --> 34:58.141
I tried, security's shut down
for the weekend,

34:58.308 --> 34:59.935
but the building should be empty.

35:00.110 --> 35:01.134
Yeah, or not.

35:02.813 --> 35:05.805
You head to the roof just to be safe.
Make sure it's clear.

35:05.982 --> 35:08.582
We'll head to the basement.
If they know this is sitting on oil...

35:08.718 --> 35:10.413
Maybe they moved the bombs there.

35:10.954 --> 35:11.978
Hey.

35:13.757 --> 35:15.282
Just come back
in one piece, all right?

35:16.927 --> 35:19.294
Sounded better when Hetty said it.

35:26.102 --> 35:28.571
G., over there.

35:29.139 --> 35:31.904
- Copper Hyundai, gray Subaru.
- Bomb squad?

35:32.075 --> 35:33.634
No time.

35:33.810 --> 35:35.938
Guess we got to risk it.

35:44.888 --> 35:46.947
This car looks clean.

35:50.493 --> 35:52.325
I don't see any bomb.

35:52.495 --> 35:54.361
Door's unlocked.

35:54.531 --> 35:56.295
Pop the trunk.

35:57.300 --> 35:59.701
Easy, easy.

36:14.217 --> 36:17.744
Okay. Okay.

36:27.731 --> 36:29.358
No wires.

36:30.867 --> 36:31.993
No switches.

36:33.069 --> 36:34.901
No device.

36:37.607 --> 36:39.701
HMX is gone.

36:42.345 --> 36:45.144
They already moved the bomb
into the basement.

36:54.057 --> 36:55.616
Oh, damn it.

36:55.792 --> 36:57.232
Why did Rodger have to be
so popular?

36:57.394 --> 37:00.830
Callen, Sam, we have a situation.
Party people that didn't get the memo.

37:00.997 --> 37:03.398
- Copy.
- Any sign of the roommates?

37:07.237 --> 37:09.899
No, I don't see them.
Let's get these people out of here.

37:10.073 --> 37:11.313
You have to leave the building.

37:15.412 --> 37:17.210
That's got to be it.

37:36.666 --> 37:39.294
Federal agents!
Put your hands in the air.

37:39.469 --> 37:40.994
Back away from the device.

37:43.340 --> 37:44.933
Bakri told us where to find you.

37:45.108 --> 37:46.473
I don't believe you.

37:46.643 --> 37:48.372
He sent us here to talk to you,

37:48.545 --> 37:50.513
to convince you
not to go through with this.

37:52.115 --> 37:55.278
Lies. It was Bakri who persuaded us
that this is the only way.

37:55.452 --> 37:58.319
- But it's not.
- Your people in your country need help,

37:58.722 --> 38:01.248
but bloodshed and terror
aren't the answer.

38:01.424 --> 38:03.586
Don't stoop to their level, man.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.758
Now, back away from the device.

38:08.798 --> 38:10.197
It's time to walk away.

38:10.800 --> 38:13.770
If I don't go through with this,
it will all have been for nothing.

38:13.937 --> 38:15.564
No. If you don't go through with this,

38:15.739 --> 38:17.537
it means you haven't
turned into one of them.

38:19.876 --> 38:21.571
It's okay.

38:22.879 --> 38:26.110
Put it down. Put it down.

38:26.983 --> 38:28.747
Slowly.

38:29.085 --> 38:31.213
Put it down. Come on.

38:31.388 --> 38:34.517
- Come on. Right here. It's all good.
- Come on, buddy.

38:34.958 --> 38:37.723
Turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.

38:40.463 --> 38:41.692
Where's your roommate?

38:41.865 --> 38:43.833
- Other side of the building.
- Get down.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.490
Get down.

38:45.668 --> 38:48.035
- Sam?
- I got this.

39:08.892 --> 39:10.382
Federal agents!

39:14.230 --> 39:15.857
Don't do it.

39:20.036 --> 39:21.367
Guys, we're all secure.

39:21.538 --> 39:23.472
Okay, copy that.

39:27.444 --> 39:28.570
Hell of a day.

39:29.312 --> 39:30.711
Yeah.

39:31.114 --> 39:32.343
Hell of a day.

39:46.830 --> 39:47.854
What is it?

39:48.631 --> 39:51.464
Someone just left me a love note.

39:51.634 --> 39:52.874
- Let me see that.
- No, no, no.

39:53.002 --> 39:55.300
- Let me see it.
- This is between me and my Juliet.

39:56.940 --> 39:59.841
Not so fast, fair Romeo.
Turns out, somebody, uh...

40:00.009 --> 40:01.807
Somebody loves themselves
some Deeks too.

40:01.978 --> 40:03.605
Yeah?

40:04.581 --> 40:08.347
And has a thing
for intelligent brunettes.

40:08.918 --> 40:12.320
And really loves tall, dark,
handsome men with razor-sharp wit.

40:12.489 --> 40:15.459
- Oh, you must have gotten mine.
- It says "tall, dark and handsome."

40:16.059 --> 40:18.551
Well, uh, good night, guys.

40:18.728 --> 40:20.218
Night's not over yet, you two.

40:20.630 --> 40:21.756
It's not?

40:24.334 --> 40:26.803
When everything's on the line,
like it was today,

40:26.970 --> 40:28.610
there's nobody
I'd rather have by my side.

40:29.439 --> 40:31.771
- Amen.
- Let's get a drink, huh?

40:31.941 --> 40:33.500
- Let's doit.
- I could go for a beer.

40:33.676 --> 40:35.166
- I could go for several.
- Me too.

40:35.345 --> 40:36.574
Several?

40:36.746 --> 40:38.942
- Such a lady.
- Lady is thirsty.

40:39.115 --> 40:42.016
I was thinking you're more
of, like, a chocolate martini...

40:42.185 --> 40:44.620
They're quite a team, Henrietta.

40:44.787 --> 40:48.519
They're my '27 Yankees.

40:49.092 --> 40:51.584
Doesn't get any easier, does it?

40:52.729 --> 40:56.688
Sending them out each time,
never knowing if they'll come back.

40:59.602 --> 41:02.003
They always come back, Owen.

41:04.107 --> 41:07.907
Until one day they don't
