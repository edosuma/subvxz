This is where it gonna stop!

01:00.190 --> 01:03.289
HANDS UP, and not a single move!

01:05.090 --> 01:08.329
You don't act so cocky anymore!

01:33.130 --> 01:36.229
Furuya, are you alright?
Yeah, everything is ok!

01:38.830 --> 01:40.469
These eyes! don't tell me...

01:40.470 --> 01:42.809
Furuya! move apart! Don't move

01:44.290 --> 01:46.489
Wait!

01:54.850 --> 01:57.049
Police station w... wait!

02:01.290 --> 02:04.589
Waaait! hey, it's dangerous!

02:20.190 --> 02:22.389
Damn it!

02:46.190 --> 02:49.929
Stout, Aquavit, Riesling

03:09.870 --> 03:12.389
In progress... sent

03:23.590 --> 03:25.589
No!

03:25.590 --> 03:28.389
Akai

03:37.790 --> 03:41.829
Get out from here, she
belongs to the bureau!

04:36.890 --> 04:39.089
What the hell is this...!

04:55.570 --> 04:57.769
You're not getting away!

05:18.810 --> 05:22.649
If she gets away, the world is going
to sink and there will be panic!

05:28.090 --> 05:30.989
Don't tell me ...!
She caught up to me?

05:55.830 --> 05:57.829
Rye...!

05:57.830 --> 06:01.529
Interesting...
i'm going to kill you!

07:23.550 --> 07:27.129
Akai... swelling ...!

07:44.690 --> 07:50.269
It's me!
The bird got away. i'll keep you ted.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.989
Understood!

08:52.990 --> 08:55.509
I'm Kudo shinichi, a high school detective,

08:55.510 --> 08:59.989
while being in an attraction park
with my childhood friend, Ran mouri,

08:59.990 --> 09:04.169
i noticed a suspected transaction
between some men in black

09:06.250 --> 09:07.829
Occupied by the scene, i didn't see

09:07.830 --> 09:12.549
that a third man approached me from behind

09:13.690 --> 09:16.529
He made me take a poison,

09:16.530 --> 09:18.729
and when i woke up,

09:22.610 --> 09:24.809
My body had shrunken!

09:27.490 --> 09:30.069
If those guys learn that i'm still alive,

09:30.070 --> 09:34.229
this will put all my relatives
and acquaintance in danger

09:36.530 --> 09:39.529
I've hidden my true identity, following Dr.
Agasa's advice,

09:39.530 --> 09:41.809
when Ran asked about my name,

09:41.810 --> 09:43.809
i came up with "Edogawa conan"

09:43.810 --> 09:49.669
in order to know more about them, i decided
to live with Ran's dad, who is a detective.

09:51.270 --> 09:56.749
My true identity is known by another
person beside the professor

09:56.750 --> 10:00.489
Ai Haibara, her real name is Shiho Miyano.

10:00.490 --> 10:05.922
She belonged to the black organization,
but in order to put an end

10:05.947 --> 10:10.973
to her life, she took the same
drug as i, and shrunk as well.

10:19.650 --> 10:22.029
And this mysterious organization...

10:22.030 --> 10:27.709
All we know about it, is that its members
have a code name related to alcohol

10:27.710 --> 10:33.929
in order to destroy it, many agents
have infiltrated this organization.

10:33.930 --> 10:39.229
The CIA agent, Mizunashi Rena, Alias "Kir".

10:39.230 --> 10:45.609
From the secret police bureau, Amuro toru,
his code name is "Bourbon" Nicknamed "zero".

10:45.610 --> 10:51.249
FBI the FBI agents are trying to
crush the organization as well.

10:51.250 --> 10:55.749
James Black, Andre Camel,
Jodie Starling....

10:55.750 --> 10:59.149
and Akai shûichi.

10:59.150 --> 11:03.109
He's the best agent and sniper in the FBI.

11:03.110 --> 11:06.989
Amuro and him seem to have some
disagreement related to their common past.

11:06.990 --> 11:09.829
My body shrunk, but my
brain is still the same

11:09.830 --> 11:12.489
i'm the unbeatable detective.

11:12.490 --> 11:16.949
There is only one truth!

11:30.270 --> 11:33.929
Professor, there is no popcorn left!

11:33.930 --> 11:37.729
You've eaten everything?
What about us?

11:37.730 --> 11:39.729
Sorry, sorry!

11:39.730 --> 11:43.397
You seem to be preoccupied by something
there was a pile-up last night,

11:43.422 --> 11:46.809
and the suspect is still on the run
but something is disturbing me

11:46.810 --> 11:49.049
The end of the renovation
of the new Suzuki aquarium

11:49.050 --> 11:53.229
they are talking about the aquarium on TV!

11:53.230 --> 11:55.569
Let me see, conan!

11:55.570 --> 11:57.069
Ok!

11:57.070 --> 12:00.769
Me too, i want to see... hey, it hurts!

12:00.770 --> 12:03.289
Come on, we cannot do
everything at the same time!

12:03.290 --> 12:05.609
Pff, that's annoying!

12:05.610 --> 12:09.609
Be patient Genta, it has just started!
It's starting!

12:09.610 --> 12:12.710
The opening of the Tôto aquarium
and its gigantic wheel is, near!

12:13.030 --> 12:17.309
"opening of the new park after renovations!"
We are going to present you the project.

12:17.310 --> 12:21.929
This renewed park is going to
be divided in three zones.

12:21.930 --> 12:28.989
In the first one, you will enjoy
the park and its restaurants,

12:28.990 --> 12:31.469
while admiring the ocean.

12:31.470 --> 12:36.209
The distance will allow you to enjoy
the attraction park with your kids

12:36.210 --> 12:38.829
while still being in maritime environment.

12:38.830 --> 12:43.889
The second zone is going to be
for the maritime attractions,

12:43.890 --> 12:45.889
as well as animal shows.

12:45.890 --> 12:50.989
These shows are going to be
held regularly and for free.

12:50.990 --> 12:54.170
In addition of assisting,
you will have the privilege

12:54.195 --> 12:57.349
to be in contact with the
animals and play with them.

12:57.350 --> 12:58.789
Bye bye!

12:58.790 --> 12:59.929
The dolphin!

12:59.930 --> 13:04.329
And the big surprise of this renovation

13:04.330 --> 13:07.769
is the biggest wheel in the whole world

13:07.770 --> 13:12.669
high by 200 meters and with
the highest technology,

13:12.670 --> 13:16.549
it will be sible to get on
it, thanks to its cabins

13:16.550 --> 13:23.209
the gigantic wheel will be in itself
an attraction, thanks to its lights

13:23.210 --> 13:27.069
and will overwhelm the
whole park by its size

13:27.070 --> 13:29.809
we are looking forward to visiting it!

13:29.810 --> 13:32.749
I wanna ride the gigantic wheel!
Me too

13:32.750 --> 13:35.169
we came for the aquarium, didn't we?

13:35.170 --> 13:37.589
But it would be good to
visit the whole park!

13:37.590 --> 13:40.389
Yeah! yeah, let's go!

13:40.390 --> 13:43.749
Thanks for buying us the
tickets, professor.

13:43.750 --> 13:44.829
What?

13:44.830 --> 13:47.669
We can already see the attractions!

13:47.670 --> 13:49.669
True! amazing!

13:49.670 --> 13:51.869
Five minutes left, calm down!

14:20.830 --> 14:23.029
We arrived at last!

14:23.910 --> 14:26.729
Let's go! awesome!

14:26.730 --> 14:30.789
Wait for me, Genta!
Hurry up! Haibara

14:30.790 --> 14:33.869
you too, conan
we have to buy the tickets

14:33.870 --> 14:38.029
if you want the tickets to get into wheel,
you will have to answer a little question

14:38.030 --> 14:42.549
what are you talking about?
You said that you were going to buy them

14:42.550 --> 14:44.249
let's do this, then!

14:44.250 --> 14:48.429
I will buy the tickets
if you solve a riddle

14:48.430 --> 14:55.049
let's go: between these
colors, which one change

14:55.050 --> 14:57.709
when it is extremely mixed?

14:57.710 --> 15:04.149
1- red 2-blue 3-brown 4-black

15:04.150 --> 15:06.429
this is too complicated.....

15:06.430 --> 15:08.789
how are we suped to guess which color?

15:08.790 --> 15:11.009
I don't understand a thing

15:11.010 --> 15:13.009
professor!

15:13.010 --> 15:15.009
Don't act s so childishly!

15:15.010 --> 15:18.709
It's rather simple, if we
"concentrate" the colors....

15:18.710 --> 15:21.189
to concentrate them!

15:22.430 --> 15:24.849
For example, Aka becomes maccha

15:24.850 --> 15:26.429
and ao becomes massao

15:26.430 --> 15:28.969
Ai-kun, that's cheating! I get it!
It's brown because it becomes swarthy!

15:28.970 --> 15:30.969
Dark brown is known as "maccha"!

15:30.970 --> 15:33.229
Right, of course!

15:33.230 --> 15:35.949
Yeah what does this mean?

15:35.950 --> 15:42.149
Red becomes scarlet, blue, ultramarine,
brown, swarthy, black, jet, that's all.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.409
It's not like this, Genta-kun!

15:44.410 --> 15:47.409
The "swarthy" looks like
the word "green tea"!

15:47.410 --> 15:50.329
Yes, it becomes "tea"!

15:50.330 --> 15:53.729
Hey, they've helped you, this is cheating!

15:53.730 --> 15:56.249
This is the way for the tickets!
Yeah!!

15:56.250 --> 15:57.729
Wait!

15:57.730 --> 16:00.229
We are going to ride the gigantic wheel!

16:00.230 --> 16:03.029
It... it doesn't count!

16:07.430 --> 16:12.069
I would've loved to touch the dolphins!
The show was great, wasn't it?

16:12.070 --> 16:14.069
What's going on?

16:14.070 --> 16:16.069
Hey, wait!

16:16.070 --> 16:19.529
Are you alright, miss?

16:19.530 --> 16:21.529
What?

16:21.530 --> 16:25.729
You're wounded on your face!
You have heterochromia, it's rare!

16:25.730 --> 16:29.189
Heterochromia: means "different
(hetero-) colors (-chromia)."

16:29.190 --> 16:31.189
maybe she doesn't speak Japanese.

16:31.190 --> 16:33.549
I....i can't understand it.

16:33.550 --> 16:35.809
You're alone in a place like
this, what happened to you?

16:35.810 --> 16:38.329
You don't have anyone with you, apparently!

16:38.330 --> 16:41.869
In addition, you're hurt
in your knees and hand....

16:41.870 --> 16:44.449
you're badly hurt!

16:44.450 --> 16:47.429
Show me this.
Yes.

16:47.430 --> 16:50.369
Since when are you here?

16:50.370 --> 16:51.969
Well..

16:51.970 --> 16:54.649
But where do you come from?

16:54.650 --> 16:56.849
I have no idea...

16:58.170 --> 17:00.169
What's you name?

17:00.170 --> 17:02.169
What's my name...?

17:02.170 --> 17:04.709
Sorry, i don't know.

17:04.710 --> 17:06.969
Show me your head, please.

17:06.970 --> 17:09.369
Yes.

17:09.650 --> 17:13.148
It's not a fatal wound, but it's deep.

17:13.150 --> 17:16.829
She must have hit her head with an old car

17:16.829 --> 17:20.348
there are some bruises here and there....

17:20.349 --> 17:23.329
but how do you know about the old car?

17:23.329 --> 17:28.108
Look here, there are some
windshield's splinters

17:28.109 --> 17:31.909
but the recent designs have
protective coat against the splinters

17:31.910 --> 17:34.929
so, she hit her head with driving

17:34.930 --> 17:38.029
that car had a blue painting

17:38.030 --> 17:40.521
these splinters are recent,
and come from a blue

17:40.546 --> 17:42.809
car, so she was the
driver or the passenger.

17:42.810 --> 17:47.469
What's more, she reeks of gasoline.

17:47.470 --> 17:49.769
True!

17:49.770 --> 17:53.589
You don't have anything
else with you, miss?

17:59.610 --> 18:01.949
That's... let me see that!

18:01.950 --> 18:04.649
Yes. what's that!

18:04.650 --> 18:07.069
It looks like a cards holder...

18:07.070 --> 18:09.769
but it looks a bit weird.

18:09.770 --> 18:12.189
What cards are going to be put in to it!

18:13.370 --> 18:15.369
Conan, Haibara!

18:15.370 --> 18:17.969
We've got the tickets!

18:17.970 --> 18:20.429
And the trouble starts!

18:20.430 --> 18:23.129
Who is this?

18:23.130 --> 18:26.789
Your eyes have different colors!

18:26.790 --> 18:28.429
It's pretty!

18:28.430 --> 18:30.429
Are these fake eyes?

18:30.430 --> 18:33.909
No, Genta, this lady is wall-eyed!

18:33.910 --> 18:37.529
Wall-eyed!
She has a creepy name!

18:37.530 --> 18:40.989
No, that's not her name!

18:40.990 --> 18:43.669
I get it!
She's training the seals!

18:43.670 --> 18:45.669
A seal trainer!

18:45.670 --> 18:48.209
Don't you think, conan?

18:48.210 --> 18:50.209
Yeah....

18:50.210 --> 18:52.209
i'm sorry

18:52.210 --> 18:54.669
there is nothing wrong with laughing

18:54.670 --> 18:58.869
talking seriously now,
what are we doing here?

18:58.870 --> 19:00.609
You came at the right time professor

19:00.610 --> 19:05.189
it seems that this woman has lost
her memory because of an accident

19:05.190 --> 19:07.189
really, shin.....

19:07.190 --> 19:09.189
conan!

19:09.190 --> 19:12.289
Yeah, i think that we should call the cops

19:12.290 --> 19:14.289
c...cops, but why?

19:14.290 --> 19:16.289
Stop!

19:16.290 --> 19:20.189
Is it a problem if we call the police?

19:20.190 --> 19:22.189
I don't know...

19:22.190 --> 19:25.389
well,.... let's take a picture then.

19:25.390 --> 19:28.589
Don't move!

19:29.650 --> 19:32.869
Wait miss, we are not
going to call the police.

19:32.870 --> 19:37.729
We are just going to look for an acquaintance
of yours, and we need a picture.

19:37.730 --> 19:42.629
My... acquaintance?
Yes, we are going to show them you picture

19:42.630 --> 19:46.009
really conan? we wanna help!

19:46.010 --> 19:50.849
In the name of the detective boys

19:53.210 --> 19:57.789
We are going to help you looking
for your friends and your memory!

19:57.790 --> 20:00.089
Trust us!

20:00.090 --> 20:02.689
Thank you so much

20:02.690 --> 20:06.089
let's try to find someone that she knows
yes.

20:06.090 --> 20:08.989
But how are you going to do that?

20:08.990 --> 20:12.829
It's obvious, professor!
We are going to look around!

20:12.830 --> 20:15.489
And where are you going?

20:15.490 --> 20:17.489
Yes, let's go!

20:17.490 --> 20:19.809
Let's go

20:19.810 --> 20:22.689
let's hurry!

20:22.690 --> 20:26.609
Hey, kids, it's not the
time to play around!

20:26.610 --> 20:30.109
You're really not going to call the police?

20:30.110 --> 20:32.189
No way

20:36.850 --> 20:40.429
Turn it off damn it!

20:42.950 --> 20:44.949
Dad!

20:44.950 --> 20:47.149
Yoko-Chan...

20:53.070 --> 20:55.769
Hey... wake up dad!

20:55.770 --> 20:59.289
How much time do you still plan to sleep?

20:59.290 --> 21:04.709
Shut up, sleep is essential
for a detective!

21:04.710 --> 21:07.869
In other words, you've got
a hangover and a headache

21:07.870 --> 21:09.869
no, that no true....

21:09.870 --> 21:11.869
not at all...

21:11.870 --> 21:14.189
It's from conan

21:14.190 --> 21:18.369
he's saying that this woman is amnesic,
and don't want to call the police.

21:18.370 --> 21:21.509
I think that we should call
officer Takagi, but anyway......

21:21.510 --> 21:22.909
can you take care of this?

21:22.910 --> 21:24.909
What a beauty!

21:24.910 --> 21:29.069
Are you listening to me?
I'll take care of it, you can count on me!

21:29.070 --> 21:32.169
What's wrong with you? i know!

21:32.170 --> 21:34.169
Wait, dad!

21:34.170 --> 21:36.649
Duty is calling me!

21:36.650 --> 21:38.929
But it's not for that.....

21:38.930 --> 21:41.109
seriously, what's happening to him?

21:41.110 --> 21:43.109
Inspector.

21:43.110 --> 21:46.929
Here are the last pictures of the accident

21:46.930 --> 21:52.369
this pile-up is clearly not random.

21:52.370 --> 21:54.369
A pile-up.....

21:54.370 --> 21:56.709
there were some huge damages

21:56.710 --> 21:59.289
so this is the woman, who
supedly lost her memory?

21:59.290 --> 22:04.869
We have few information about
the reasons of this accident

22:04.870 --> 22:06.869
we need to investigate

22:06.870 --> 22:09.469
yes, we have to look a little
bit deeper in this case.

22:09.470 --> 22:11.469
Inspector Megure!

22:11.470 --> 22:13.469
So?

22:13.470 --> 22:17.369
We found evidence of a breaking and
entering in the north wing during the night

22:17.370 --> 22:20.049
i see... what is it?

22:20.050 --> 22:24.529
There are some things that we are not
suped to talk about in this headquarter

22:24.530 --> 22:26.529
which means?

22:26.530 --> 22:30.549
There was some important
information stolen apparently

22:30.550 --> 22:32.749
what does this means?

22:34.090 --> 22:38.629
It's something too big for us

22:59.430 --> 23:01.429
Bingo

23:01.430 --> 23:04.349
i found her, Gin.

23:04.350 --> 23:06.349
Where? Tôto aquarium.

23:06.350 --> 23:08.349
The aquarium? yes.

23:08.350 --> 23:12.429
Don't worry, i'll bring
her back right away.

23:13.770 --> 23:16.629
Welcome to the Suzuki maritime park!

23:23.850 --> 23:27.489
You think that bringing her here
will help her remember something?

23:27.490 --> 23:31.409
Yes, she could recognize
someone in this crowd

23:31.410 --> 23:34.789
but it's still a bit weird that
she doesn't remember a thing

23:34.790 --> 23:38.209
yes, but where are we going now?

23:38.210 --> 23:41.489
I've no idea

23:41.490 --> 23:45.049
yes, why don't you try this?

23:45.050 --> 23:47.249
Gosh......

23:56.530 --> 23:58.529
Amazing!

23:58.530 --> 24:01.729
Congratulation! you've
got the highest score!

24:01.730 --> 24:04.909
Come on, a little clap

24:04.910 --> 24:06.909
we like the dolphins!

24:06.910 --> 24:06.909
Yeah! let's do it too!

24:06.910 --> 24:09.310
Come on, come on

24:09.510 --> 24:11.269
yes

24:11.270 --> 24:14.129
i want this one!

24:14.130 --> 24:16.709
At last you're smiling, miss!

24:16.710 --> 24:20.529
No saying, you're much
beautiful when you're smiling

24:20.530 --> 24:22.929
isn't it? really?

24:22.930 --> 24:26.889
No doubt!
Which one would you like to take?

24:26.890 --> 24:29.629
Awesome!

24:29.630 --> 24:32.529
Which one we take? this one!

24:32.530 --> 24:34.529
Rather this one or this one!

24:34.530 --> 24:37.109
How do you feel, are you alright?

24:37.110 --> 24:40.429
No, don't worry, i'm OK.

24:40.430 --> 24:43.989
But.... you have to choose as well.

24:43.990 --> 24:47.449
Hey, guys! hey, conan, Ai!

24:47.450 --> 24:52.549
Her memory isn't going to come back
like this, let her rest a bit.

24:52.550 --> 24:56.609
But...! it's the first time i see
something like this in a game!

24:56.610 --> 24:59.929
If you ask me, i think that this
lady can win everything here!

24:59.930 --> 25:01.929
They didn't understand a thing!

25:01.930 --> 25:06.169
What are going to do? it looks like it
gonna be a little bit complicated in here.

25:06.170 --> 25:08.609
Hey, everyone!

25:08.610 --> 25:12.929
You should stay together!

25:12.930 --> 25:15.549
We get it professor!

25:15.550 --> 25:20.429
There are few people in the gigantic wheel
it's our chance!

25:20.430 --> 25:24.669
Really! let's go then!

25:24.670 --> 25:28.709
Good idea, she could remember something!

25:28.710 --> 25:33.149
Let's go!
This way, come on, come on!

25:34.450 --> 25:39.329
Gosh......!
It could be helpful actually

25:39.330 --> 25:43.909
if you ask me, it must be a
trick made by the professor

25:43.910 --> 25:46.149
i've been discovered...

25:46.150 --> 25:51.109
excuse-me, have you ever seen
that lady by your booth before?

25:51.110 --> 25:54.769
The silver haired young lady?

25:54.770 --> 25:56.769
Yes, do you know her?

25:56.770 --> 25:58.769
I don't remember.....

25:58.770 --> 26:02.849
i don't even think that i've ever
had a talented client like her.

26:02.850 --> 26:05.669
A perfect score....

26:05.670 --> 26:07.929
that's out of the ordinary....

26:07.930 --> 26:09.929
thank you mister!

26:09.930 --> 26:11.929
Yeah!

26:11.930 --> 26:15.129
Can you give this to your friend?

26:15.130 --> 26:17.129
What? this is ...!

26:17.130 --> 26:19.329
A blank dolphin, it doesn't
have any color yet.

26:19.330 --> 26:23.249
I thought that the lady might like it.

26:23.250 --> 26:27.629
She can paint with the
color that she likes.

26:27.630 --> 26:31.269
I'm sure she's gonna be pleased.
Thanks again!

26:31.270 --> 26:33.949
You're welcome have fun!

26:33.950 --> 26:38.109
Let's go Haibara!
Where are we going?

26:38.110 --> 26:43.489
I left the lady with the professor, he
will watch her, and i can think freely.

26:43.490 --> 26:49.889
We need to gather some
information about the lady

26:50.213 --> 27:06.613
<b>Www.ZooCine.CoM
Watch Movies And Series!</b>

27:07.090 --> 27:11.789
I'm all excited!
I'm wondering how is the view right there!

27:11.790 --> 27:13.789
Maybe we will see the bell tree tower!

27:13.790 --> 27:16.269
What are doing here? we're getting back.

27:16.270 --> 27:21.049
Miss, you going to lose your place!

27:21.050 --> 27:25.289
Sorry, i thought that
someone was talking to me.

27:25.290 --> 27:27.289
Someone you know.

27:27.290 --> 27:30.489
No, she must've confused me with someone

27:30.490 --> 27:32.849
well, everybody is ready? yes!

27:32.850 --> 27:35.309
Of course!
In this case, it's this way!

27:35.310 --> 27:39.689
Something is wrong, she seems amnesic.

27:39.690 --> 27:43.089
Hurry up!
Make sure she remembers everything.

27:43.090 --> 27:45.289
Understood!

27:49.030 --> 27:52.169
Maybe it's wiser to let the police know....

27:52.170 --> 27:55.089
i should call the professor to ask about
their whereabouts, don't you think?

27:55.090 --> 27:57.089
Yes!

27:57.090 --> 27:59.549
You're acting strangely since back there

27:59.550 --> 28:01.549
really!

28:01.550 --> 28:05.249
Hey, conan, Haibara!
We are here.

28:05.250 --> 28:08.609
Above! do you see us?

28:08.610 --> 28:11.149
Here, this way!

28:11.150 --> 28:13.149
Genta, pay attention!

28:13.150 --> 28:15.569
But why? Genta!

28:17.370 --> 28:19.369
Genta!

28:19.370 --> 28:21.369
Genta!

28:21.370 --> 28:23.909
I'm falling!
What am i suped to do?

28:23.910 --> 28:25.909
Don't let me down!

28:25.910 --> 28:28.109
Hurry! Genta!

28:53.890 --> 28:55.889
Are you alright Genta!

28:55.890 --> 28:58.549
Genta, wake up!

29:05.290 --> 29:07.789
But, What are you doing here?

29:07.790 --> 29:09.989
Thanks god!

29:12.810 --> 29:16.929
Miss? right, i fall!?

29:16.930 --> 29:19.469
Are you alright? is everyone ok?

29:19.470 --> 29:22.569
The lady saved me, everything is alright!

29:22.570 --> 29:26.769
Ouf...
let me bring you to the nursery!

29:31.850 --> 29:33.849
But how.....?

29:33.850 --> 29:36.949
You're gonna be ok know!

29:36.950 --> 29:38.949
Thanks a lot!

29:38.950 --> 29:41.409
Well, let's get up!

29:41.410 --> 29:46.049
Aie, aie aie
how come he as hurt?

29:46.050 --> 29:49.169
Unbelievable a real kid.

29:49.170 --> 29:51.969
You will see when you become older like me!

29:51.970 --> 29:55.229
Now that everything is alright,
let's go to the gigantic wheel!

29:55.230 --> 29:57.609
Exactly! hen, miss?

29:57.610 --> 30:00.449
Let's go yes, but....

30:00.450 --> 30:03.349
you must be supervised by someone.

30:03.350 --> 30:05.749
What are saying?

30:05.750 --> 30:08.369
You're our guardian?

30:08.370 --> 30:11.129
Yes, well then, let's go.

30:11.130 --> 30:14.669
Wait!
Conan, i need to talk to you.

30:14.670 --> 30:18.129
In this case let go, and you..

30:18.130 --> 30:20.469
No, watch them carefully.

30:20.470 --> 30:22.469
Ok!

30:22.470 --> 30:25.329
What's this all about? damn it!

30:33.050 --> 30:35.049
What, what?

30:35.050 --> 30:39.709
What do you think? let's keep this
a secret from Haibara and conan!

30:39.710 --> 30:44.609
You absolutely sure? this lady,
could she really be one of them...!

30:44.610 --> 30:49.409
I'm not sure, but...
didn't you feel anything?

30:49.410 --> 30:54.849
That right eye... it reminds
me of what i told you

30:54.850 --> 30:58.109
the story that you... you mean

30:58.110 --> 31:02.269
yes, the number 2 in the syndicate!

31:05.590 --> 31:07.789
Rum!

31:11.210 --> 31:13.209
Miss, miss!

31:13.210 --> 31:15.909
What's going on?

31:22.790 --> 31:24.789
If that woman is really Rum....

31:24.790 --> 31:28.069
then this amnesia that already
seems weird to me.........

31:28.070 --> 31:31.929
it's true that Rum doesn't
have a reliable description.

31:31.930 --> 31:36.849
Except his eyes, no one in the syndicate
seems to agree with how he looks like!

31:36.850 --> 31:42.609
A well build man, an
effeminate man, or an old man

31:42.610 --> 31:50.610
and particularly... the fact
that one of his eyes is hurt!

31:52.530 --> 31:56.269
If that woman's eye is prosthetic,
then it's sible that.....

31:56.270 --> 32:00.209
i see, her amnesia could be a trick

32:00.210 --> 32:05.069
but why didn't she already take
care of our acquaintances?

32:05.070 --> 32:07.069
Well....

32:07.070 --> 32:09.629
she really looks amnesic
from what i can see

32:09.630 --> 32:12.649
the men in black are, perhaps,
not aware of anything.

32:12.650 --> 32:17.569
But if we help her to retrieve
her memory, we can.....

32:17.570 --> 32:20.809
no, definitely not this!

32:20.810 --> 32:22.809
Don't tell me that....

32:22.810 --> 32:26.389
you wanna use her memories to gather
some information about the syndicate

32:26.390 --> 32:28.609
don't even think about it!

32:28.610 --> 32:32.649
There is no one left with me besides you!

32:32.650 --> 32:36.049
And if these kids ever...

32:36.050 --> 32:38.049
disappear?

32:38.050 --> 32:40.049
The professor should
have been watching them!

32:40.050 --> 32:42.649
You're lovely!

32:42.650 --> 32:44.649
Professor!

32:44.650 --> 32:48.869
Hey, you've scared them!

32:48.870 --> 32:50.869
Where are they?

32:50.870 --> 32:52.869
Where are the kids?

32:52.870 --> 32:54.869
What...?

32:54.870 --> 32:58.009
It's conan!
Don't pick up, you know what...

32:58.010 --> 33:00.669
we are going to be yelled at otherwise!

33:00.670 --> 33:05.149
Yes, right!
Look! we are raising!

33:05.150 --> 33:07.689
Do you see that, miss?

33:07.690 --> 33:09.689
It's really beautiful!

33:09.690 --> 33:11.689
The call wasn't made...

33:11.690 --> 33:14.789
damn it, those idiots....
let's calm down and think.

33:14.790 --> 33:16.789
What were they trying to do?

33:16.790 --> 33:18.789
Of course!

33:18.790 --> 33:20.789
Wait for me!

33:20.790 --> 33:25.909
You must be doing some
extreme sport, aren't you?

33:25.910 --> 33:30.469
Well yes, seeing how you saved Genta,
and you agility is extraordinary!

33:30.470 --> 33:35.029
It's true, you've got a good style!
"style"?

33:35.030 --> 33:37.029
Well....

33:37.030 --> 33:40.369
yes,
we are getting close to the top!

33:40.370 --> 33:43.649
We can she the aquarium's roof!

33:43.650 --> 33:46.949
It's beautiful! so cool!

33:46.950 --> 33:50.529
Don't you see? yes, it's pretty.

33:50.530 --> 33:54.589
Look there, at the
colors, there are a lot!

33:54.590 --> 33:56.589
Come closer!

33:56.590 --> 33:58.789
Yes.

34:06.990 --> 34:09.589
Are you alright?
What's the problem?

34:09.590 --> 34:12.569
It's ok, it's just
that i'm feeling dizzy!

34:12.570 --> 34:15.449
It's true that it's a bit high!

34:15.449 --> 34:17.449
Yes...

34:17.449 --> 34:19.889
just a little bit and
we'll be reaching the top!

34:19.889 --> 34:22.089
True!

34:24.389 --> 34:26.389
Water jet!

34:26.389 --> 34:29.228
It's magnificent!

34:34.969 --> 34:36.969
Are you alright, miss?

34:36.969 --> 34:38.969
Hold on!

34:38.969 --> 34:42.569
Wait, we are going to call conan.

34:42.570 --> 34:44.569
Ayumi, Mitsuhiko!

34:44.570 --> 34:47.469
The lady is not looking well!

34:47.469 --> 34:49.469
She's remembering something maybe?

34:49.469 --> 34:53.029
Ayumi, call conan, hurry!

34:53.030 --> 34:56.248
Genta-kun, what is she saying?

34:56.250 --> 34:58.889
She's saying some weird things!

34:58.890 --> 35:01.469
Like what? Kir, bourbon...

35:01.470 --> 35:04.029
she's saying it again!

35:04.030 --> 35:06.029
Quiet Genta!

35:06.030 --> 35:08.029
Stout...... Aquavit....

35:08.030 --> 35:10.229
Riesling!

35:12.030 --> 35:14.029
Answer please....

35:14.030 --> 35:16.229
at last...!

35:18.250 --> 35:20.249
What's wrong?

35:20.250 --> 35:22.249
It's the phone i was sure...

35:22.250 --> 35:25.149
Mistuhiko, at last....!

35:25.150 --> 35:27.149
Conan, help!

35:27.150 --> 35:29.149
Ayumi, what's going on?

35:29.150 --> 35:32.989
I don't know, the lady has a crisis!

35:32.990 --> 35:34.989
What do you mean?
What is she doing?

35:34.990 --> 35:40.149
Well, her head hurts, and she's
saying some weird things!

35:40.150 --> 35:42.889
I don't understand them!
I've noted the words!

35:42.890 --> 35:45.569
Mitsuhiko wrote them!

35:45.570 --> 35:47.569
Understood!

35:47.570 --> 35:49.769
Conan, come and help us!

35:56.070 --> 35:58.349
Conan, where is the young lady?

35:58.350 --> 36:00.829
In the nursery right now

36:00.830 --> 36:02.829
Takagi, let's go!

36:02.830 --> 36:06.309
Yes.
Haibara, professor, i'm counting on you!

36:06.310 --> 36:10.589
Well, let's follow them
no, don't even think about it!

36:20.510 --> 36:23.409
Excuse me! get in, please!

36:23.410 --> 36:26.641
As a part of an investigation,
can you provide

36:26.666 --> 36:29.529
us with some information
about the woman?

36:29.530 --> 36:31.529
Ok, i don't mind!

36:31.530 --> 36:33.978
She has just been
transported to the police

36:34.003 --> 36:36.649
hospital, but we don't
know anything about her.

36:36.650 --> 36:43.249
I can affirm that she lost her
memory due to a cerebral trauma

36:43.250 --> 36:50.809
in addition, we've found some
rather special wounds in her brain.

36:50.810 --> 36:53.589
It's sible that it was
due to a car accident?

36:53.590 --> 36:56.889
Yes, the cranium wounds
seems to match with it!

36:56.890 --> 36:59.249
Her car must have been fast to
receive this deep wound, right?

36:59.250 --> 37:04.509
Yes. a hit like this explains
perfectly the amnesia.

37:04.510 --> 37:06.509
Well, thanks for your help.

37:06.510 --> 37:09.089
So.... wait.

37:09.090 --> 37:11.089
One last thing!

37:11.090 --> 37:16.189
We've found an contact
lens in her right eye.

37:16.190 --> 37:18.189
What's this?

37:18.190 --> 37:20.189
Is it a glassy substance?

37:20.190 --> 37:24.629
Yes, it's an eye lens
that she wore on her eye.

37:24.630 --> 37:30.369
So when she was with us, her
pure what to keep an eye on us

37:30.370 --> 37:33.769
it's better to remove it for her own good.

37:33.770 --> 37:38.989
Excuse me, i came to look for the patient.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.989
Well then, we will take care of this!

37:40.990 --> 37:44.029
Yes! thanks a lot!

37:45.830 --> 37:49.269
You're not going with them?

37:49.270 --> 37:52.709
No, no, i've got an
additional question for you!

37:52.710 --> 37:58.969
What is it? it's the right lens,
we thought she was wall-eyed.

37:58.970 --> 38:02.689
So, both her eyes are blue actually?

38:02.690 --> 38:06.129
Yes, these are chromed lenses.

38:06.130 --> 38:10.549
Chromed lenses?
Yes, it's really practical.

38:10.550 --> 38:14.065
Putting them on the cornea,
it changes its color and

38:14.090 --> 38:17.249
it is matched to the
retina through the sclera.

38:17.250 --> 38:19.389
We can buy it with whatever color we want.

38:19.390 --> 38:25.469
But, then, what could be
her goal by putting them?

38:25.470 --> 38:30.169
Thanks for the information doctor!

38:30.170 --> 38:32.929
Is it enough for you? goodbye!

38:32.930 --> 38:35.449
Yes; take care!

38:35.450 --> 38:39.789
I'm here
where is the client that i'm suped to help?

38:39.790 --> 38:42.929
I've orders, you can't come in!

38:42.930 --> 38:47.449
I'm in charge of this case!

38:47.450 --> 38:49.449
Uncle!

38:49.450 --> 38:53.129
What are you doing?
Brat, you appear at the right time!

38:53.130 --> 38:56.489
So, where is that beauty?

38:56.490 --> 38:58.489
She's not here anymore.

38:58.490 --> 39:02.009
She was transported to the police hospital.

39:02.010 --> 39:05.009
In addition, you're not going
to help her like this.

39:05.010 --> 39:08.029
What?
You didn't listen to Ran's advice, hen.

39:08.030 --> 39:11.969
You still have something to do?

39:11.970 --> 39:14.169
No!

39:20.830 --> 39:22.909
What happened? how do i know?

39:22.910 --> 39:28.249
There was really something wrong.....
an amnesia.

39:28.250 --> 39:31.549
So? where is she?

39:31.550 --> 39:33.549
At the police hospital.

39:33.550 --> 39:36.289
The police shouldn't be guarding her.

39:36.290 --> 39:40.729
Nothing is intriguing you in all this?
What?

39:40.730 --> 39:45.129
While investigating about the
spy last time, she succeeded

39:45.130 --> 39:47.449
spies? yes!

39:47.450 --> 39:50.889
Understood, take care of
Suzuki's infrastructure.

39:50.890 --> 39:52.889
Understood.

39:52.890 --> 39:56.329
A spies list...... is it sible that....

39:56.330 --> 40:01.029
why did Haibara get mad? what do you think?

40:01.030 --> 40:04.649
True, it's rare.

40:04.650 --> 40:08.009
Do you know if she's still mad?

40:08.010 --> 40:10.009
Well...

40:10.010 --> 40:14.069
she was transferred and will be examined

40:14.070 --> 40:17.209
don't waste your time, he's not listening.

40:17.210 --> 40:21.549
Yes, but the professor never get mad.

40:21.550 --> 40:23.549
True.

40:23.550 --> 40:27.949
By the way, take this, it's from Conan.

40:27.950 --> 40:30.249
This is... yes!

40:30.250 --> 40:33.129
The same statuette that we got!

40:33.130 --> 40:36.649
Why doesn't it have any color?

40:36.650 --> 40:40.309
Conan told me but i forgot.

40:40.310 --> 40:43.969
What a waste of time, i'll ask him.

40:43.970 --> 40:46.449
Who's this?

40:46.450 --> 40:49.069
It's conan!

40:49.070 --> 40:51.069
Hello?

40:51.070 --> 40:54.049
Professor, the kids are
still with you right?

40:54.050 --> 40:56.949
Yes, we are eating in Poirot.

40:56.950 --> 40:59.649
I've got a favour to ask you.

40:59.650 --> 41:02.909
Ok, how is the young lady?

41:02.910 --> 41:07.249
The police wants to investigate, she
was transferred to their hospital.

41:07.250 --> 41:09.249
But she's alright!

41:09.250 --> 41:12.729
Awesome
and were you willing to ask me?

41:12.730 --> 41:16.709
I retrieved her phone, i want
you to extract its data.

41:16.710 --> 41:21.289
I won't be able to if it's
too damaged, but i will try.

41:21.290 --> 41:26.449
Thanks, and i want to know what she said

41:26.450 --> 41:29.589
when she as on the gigantic
wheel, can you tell me?

41:29.590 --> 41:34.309
Yes, i wrote everything on
a paper, wait a minute.

41:34.310 --> 41:41.489
So.....Stout....aquavit....
and finally, Riesling.

41:43.290 --> 41:45.349
Alcohols? is it sible that.....

41:45.350 --> 41:48.149
professor, you're at "Poirot" right?

41:48.150 --> 41:51.249
Yes! tell Amuro to come there!

41:51.250 --> 41:53.249
Amuro?

41:53.250 --> 41:56.589
I don't think that he's here today.

41:56.590 --> 41:59.409
He took a day off.

42:01.210 --> 42:05.149
He suddenly went when the police called.

42:05.150 --> 42:08.549
It was weird, he was worried.

42:08.550 --> 42:10.549
I see.

42:10.550 --> 42:14.649
I'll call you if he appears.

42:16.450 --> 42:18.649
No..... Amuro....

42:22.450 --> 42:24.649
London

42:35.670 --> 42:40.469
This Stout. i'm on the bus.
Wait for further instructions.

42:40.470 --> 42:42.669
Understood!

42:52.190 --> 42:57.249
Stout...
i've been trusting you. It's a shame.

42:59.050 --> 43:01.049
Stout, eliminated.

43:01.050 --> 43:03.049
Ok, come back fast.

43:03.050 --> 43:05.049
Understood

43:05.050 --> 43:07.249
Toronto

43:10.190 --> 43:16.489
The CN tower was the highest
tower in the world for 32 years!

43:16.490 --> 43:22.149
You can walk around it from
the 116th floor of the tower.

43:22.150 --> 43:26.549
Which is 356 meters above the ground!

43:26.550 --> 43:26.549
Nowadays, the.....

43:26.550 --> 43:29.709
look at the helicopter

43:29.710 --> 43:35.229
that helicopter....
no.... it can't be..

43:48.510 --> 43:52.689
Sorry, we don't like spies here!

43:52.690 --> 43:55.809
Aquavit is eliminated.

43:55.810 --> 43:57.809
Well received, you can come back now!

43:57.810 --> 44:00.810
No need to tell me!

44:02.270 --> 44:04.709
Berlin

44:09.610 --> 44:11.849
Where do you think you're going?

44:11.850 --> 44:14.989
You have one minute to explain yourself

44:14.990 --> 44:18.629
i told you, i'm not a spy!

44:18.630 --> 44:21.049
Stop joking around.
We can smell the sent of a spy

44:24.810 --> 44:27.629
Hen, Riesling!

44:27.630 --> 44:33.749
Gin! we've recently received
an information about you

44:35.550 --> 44:39.309
You're name is on the list of our spies.

44:39.310 --> 44:43.569
Let's do it right now, we're wasting time.

44:43.570 --> 44:46.389
Let me go, i'm telling you
that i'm one of them!

44:46.390 --> 44:48.389
Gin, you can trust me!

44:48.390 --> 44:52.969
Trusting you? i'm not idiot
enough to do something like that

44:52.970 --> 44:54.969
five....

44:54.970 --> 44:56.969
four...

44:56.970 --> 44:58.969
three....

44:58.970 --> 45:00.969
two...

45:00.970 --> 45:02.969
one...

45:02.970 --> 45:05.169
zero.

45:22.530 --> 45:24.529
Let's go, hurry.

45:24.530 --> 45:27.129
Where to? to Japan.

45:27.130 --> 45:29.709
Don't tell me that.....

45:29.710 --> 45:31.909
only two left.

45:38.410 --> 45:40.409
The English MI6,

45:40.410 --> 45:42.409
the CANADIAN SCRS

45:42.410 --> 45:47.529
and the German BND confirmed
their spies assassination

45:47.530 --> 45:49.529
well then....

45:49.530 --> 45:53.569
the syndicate got a list of
spies, and took care of them

45:53.570 --> 45:56.289
then, the syndicate....

45:56.290 --> 46:02.109
yes, they must have known about
that thanks to the PSB's list

46:02.110 --> 46:04.109
we need to tell Akai

46:04.110 --> 46:06.309
the syndicate has information.....

46:07.710 --> 46:09.709
Jodie-sensei!

46:09.710 --> 46:13.629
You still haven't found the
pile-up's author, have you?

46:13.630 --> 46:15.969
That's right i was right!

46:15.970 --> 46:18.729
That woman lost her memory

46:18.730 --> 46:21.429
but how is she going to react
once she retrieves it!?

46:21.430 --> 46:24.889
Her phone must have some important data!

46:24.890 --> 46:28.809
Yes, if it's not too
damaged we can get in it!

46:28.810 --> 46:32.069
It's better to give it to the FBI then

46:32.070 --> 46:34.069
that's right wait!

46:34.070 --> 46:39.669
It would be faster and safer
to give it to the professor

46:39.670 --> 46:42.869
yes, let's do this.

46:42.870 --> 46:46.729
If she gets her memory back and
she tries to contact them....

46:46.730 --> 46:49.029
the world will be gone.

46:49.030 --> 46:52.129
But what data did she steal?

46:52.130 --> 46:54.129
The non official covers!

46:54.130 --> 46:56.129
Its'....!

46:56.130 --> 46:58.129
The list of under cover spies.

46:58.130 --> 47:01.809
A long list of spies that are
infiltrating the syndicate right now

47:01.810 --> 47:07.029
but then.... if they get it,
we will lose our chance.....

47:07.030 --> 47:09.029
that's not all...

47:09.030 --> 47:11.029
in addition of being a list of NOC,

47:11.030 --> 47:13.029
it delivers some information
about their original agency

47:13.030 --> 47:15.029
then...

47:15.030 --> 47:17.261
they will have even more
difficulty to disappear from

47:17.286 --> 47:19.409
the syndicate's eyes, and
escape the assassination.

47:19.410 --> 47:24.369
Exactly.
These three assassinations....

47:24.370 --> 47:27.749
are just the beginning of the nightmare

47:36.730 --> 47:38.729
Are we really going to see her?

47:38.730 --> 47:42.629
It's a shame that conan ans
ai weren't able to come.

47:42.630 --> 47:46.649
No, they are going to tell us "don't go"!

47:46.650 --> 47:48.649
Come on, let's go!

47:48.650 --> 47:51.229
We are going to say that we didn't know!

47:51.230 --> 47:53.229
Yes... yes...

47:53.230 --> 47:55.949
the Tôto police hospital.

47:55.950 --> 48:00.329
If someone get near it, i
can count on you Kazami

48:00.330 --> 48:02.529
yes!

48:09.150 --> 48:12.349
Bourbon, what are you doing here?

48:12.350 --> 48:15.369
Trying to stop that person, obviously.

48:15.370 --> 48:20.729
You mean, silence her once
she get her ability to talk?

48:20.730 --> 48:23.389
What do you mean?

48:23.390 --> 48:26.029
I don't understand what
you're trying to say!

48:26.030 --> 48:28.789
How do you want me to tell this?

48:28.790 --> 48:32.049
This woman has some info about you!

48:32.050 --> 48:36.449
It would be good for you if
she doesn't reveal anything

48:36.450 --> 48:40.689
like your link with the
Japanese secret police.

48:40.690 --> 48:43.629
What are you talking about?

48:43.630 --> 48:45.629
Forget it

48:45.630 --> 48:48.989
let's not waste our time
we are going back

48:48.990 --> 48:54.789
if it's the syndicate order, i
guess i don't have a choice.

48:59.170 --> 49:02.509
So?
It's no use, we can't see her...

49:02.510 --> 49:05.969
seriously?
Her condition is that bad!

49:05.970 --> 49:09.229
We need to use some other way

49:09.230 --> 49:11.229
but how?

49:11.230 --> 49:13.229
This! i see

49:13.230 --> 49:16.509
let's call our best ally!

49:23.070 --> 49:25.069
Professor! conan!

49:25.070 --> 49:30.609
The data i'm still trying to decrypt
the last data from the hard disk

49:30.610 --> 49:32.609
hurry up i'm counting on you

49:32.610 --> 49:36.549
yes and... take this!

49:36.550 --> 49:39.549
Genta, you can't put it here.

49:39.550 --> 49:43.089
Sorry! officer Takagi!

49:43.090 --> 49:46.729
You really came!
So the lady! is she alright?

49:46.730 --> 49:48.729
Shut up!

49:48.730 --> 49:51.169
You're here in secret, aren't you?

49:51.170 --> 49:55.789
Who?
Sorry, i didn't have a choice...

49:55.790 --> 49:57.789
Miss!

49:57.790 --> 49:59.789
Thanks god, you're alright!

49:59.790 --> 50:01.789
You're head still hurt?

50:01.790 --> 50:05.509
No, i'm much better now, thanks.

50:05.510 --> 50:09.329
She had some tests but she
didn't recover her memory yet.

50:09.330 --> 50:15.489
You can stay with her until we know
more about her memory's condition

50:15.490 --> 50:18.069
really? thanks!

50:18.070 --> 50:21.589
But if there is a problem,
you call us immediately

50:21.590 --> 50:23.589
yes.

50:23.590 --> 50:25.589
Here we go!

50:25.590 --> 50:29.169
Where can i put the next one....

50:29.170 --> 50:31.749
well... here?

50:31.750 --> 50:33.749
Let's go

50:33.750 --> 50:35.749
and there?

50:35.750 --> 50:38.949
What do we do? it's annoying....

50:38.950 --> 50:40.949
i did it!

50:40.950 --> 50:46.249
Well yes!
Now that i think about it, that's for you!

50:46.250 --> 50:48.249
But this is...

50:48.250 --> 50:51.489
the man in the stand gave it to you

50:51.490 --> 50:53.489
paint it with your favorite color!

50:53.490 --> 50:55.909
Really, can i keep it?

50:55.910 --> 50:59.849
Of course, you've saved my life, after all!

50:59.850 --> 51:04.289
And we've got the same! see!

51:04.290 --> 51:06.969
So, which color?

51:06.970 --> 51:10.949
Red, pink?
Paint it in black or white!

51:10.950 --> 51:14.509
Seeing that you have a silver
hair, it would be perfect!

51:14.510 --> 51:16.941
Maybe much perfect with
black then white, it's

51:16.966 --> 51:19.269
would be contrast with
you hair's shininess!

51:19.270 --> 51:23.669
Genta-kun, that's stupid.
Really stupid...

51:23.670 --> 51:26.729
what, it's intelligent isn't it?

51:29.430 --> 51:31.429
Pay attention, Genta!

51:31.430 --> 51:33.429
Sorry, sorry!

51:33.430 --> 51:35.429
Are you alright?

51:35.430 --> 51:39.389
Yes, i was winning the game!

51:39.390 --> 51:41.389
Yes, but thanks to the lady!

51:41.390 --> 51:45.329
You always asked her before playing!

51:45.330 --> 51:47.329
Maybe.... it's true!

51:47.330 --> 51:49.529
Excuse me!

51:51.890 --> 51:56.569
Kazami, from the BPS.
Inspector Megure asked me to come.

51:56.570 --> 51:59.109
You're the inspector?

51:59.110 --> 52:01.609
Right, it's me!

52:01.610 --> 52:05.829
So it's you that i must
ask to handover the woman

52:05.830 --> 52:09.909
why? we are in charge of this case.

52:09.910 --> 52:13.589
She's an important witness in a PBS case

52:13.590 --> 52:16.529
we need to have her as soon as sible.

52:16.530 --> 52:22.169
I would be grateful if you hand her over.

52:22.170 --> 52:25.689
Make the right choice.

52:27.770 --> 52:29.769
Understood.

52:29.770 --> 52:33.109
In that case, follow me.

52:34.730 --> 52:37.469
Where are you going?

52:37.470 --> 52:41.069
Who knows...
she's going right now, say goodbye.

52:41.070 --> 52:43.069
Well, time to get back

52:43.070 --> 52:46.489
you need to fill the discharge form.

52:46.490 --> 52:48.489
Yes! miss!

52:48.490 --> 52:52.749
You really going? no Miss!

52:52.750 --> 52:57.209
Thanks a lot, i'll keep it safe.

52:57.210 --> 52:59.209
Yes

52:59.210 --> 53:03.009
one day, we will have another tower
on the gigantic wheel, won't we?

53:03.010 --> 53:05.009
Of course! we will do it!

53:05.010 --> 53:07.209
Well, let's go

53:13.970 --> 53:15.969
Is she going to be ok

53:15.970 --> 53:17.969
i'm worried.

53:17.970 --> 53:19.969
Yeah...

53:19.970 --> 53:22.849
Shinichi.

53:22.850 --> 53:25.729
I've decrypted the data so?

53:25.730 --> 53:31.269
Stout, Aquavit, Riesling....

53:31.270 --> 53:33.269
and those who are must interesting..

53:33.270 --> 53:36.509
Bourbon and Kir! i knew it!

53:36.510 --> 53:40.389
Professor, trace the address
that the message was sent to!

53:40.390 --> 53:43.129
Call me as soon as it's done!

53:48.390 --> 53:50.389
Haibara!

53:50.390 --> 53:53.349
Don't go, please.

53:55.750 --> 53:59.709
I already told you..... not
to run from your destiny.

53:59.710 --> 54:02.949
And me neither, i won't run away

54:12.590 --> 54:14.009
Kudo.....

54:14.010 --> 54:18.269
thank you so much
sorry for all the trouble.

54:18.270 --> 54:21.469
Be careful!

54:21.470 --> 54:23.469
Yes!

54:23.470 --> 54:26.289
Genta-kun, don't be so sad!

54:26.290 --> 54:28.289
We are going to see her!

54:28.290 --> 54:30.289
Yes, but.... well

54:30.290 --> 54:33.549
i know!
Why don't we ride the wheel again?

54:33.550 --> 54:37.049
Yes. she said that we are
going back to it together

54:37.050 --> 54:39.209
but we can go right now as well

54:39.210 --> 54:42.489
but if we go right now, it's
going to be dark by then

54:42.490 --> 54:45.329
i don't know if we can go back again.

54:45.330 --> 54:50.869
Don't worry!
We are talking about Suzuki's aquarium!

54:50.870 --> 54:52.869
Look!

54:52.870 --> 54:58.129
Yes, this is our second ally!

54:58.130 --> 55:02.549
We are here because of
that NOC's thing right?

55:02.550 --> 55:05.709
Curacao saw your name on the list.

55:05.710 --> 55:09.189
You know perfectly well why you're here.

55:09.190 --> 55:13.089
Curacao? the agent who is close to Rum?

55:13.090 --> 55:16.249
Yes. our specialist in
information collecting.

55:16.250 --> 55:17.529
You knew it?

55:17.530 --> 55:21.659
I keep telling you that
your info are not true!

55:21.660 --> 55:24.879
Killing would a great mistake that Curacao
could have been mistaken as well.

55:24.880 --> 55:27.280
Isn't that right?

55:37.890 --> 55:41.029
That's just like you, Bourbon

55:41.030 --> 55:43.429
luckily for you, we don't
have that list right now

55:43.430 --> 55:47.249
the police found her, and she escaped.

55:47.250 --> 55:48.699
You'd better confess!

55:48.700 --> 55:53.319
Then, recover Curacao to make her confirm
that our names are absent from the list

55:53.320 --> 55:58.900
Gin, if our names are not there, you
would have made a huge mistake!

56:01.500 --> 56:03.779
That's right.

56:03.780 --> 56:05.979
However...

56:08.980 --> 56:09.979
Gin Boss

56:09.980 --> 56:12.459
a mistake or not
it's up to me to confirm it.

56:12.460 --> 56:14.939
It's about time to get
ride of these vermins

56:14.940 --> 56:16.939
well, then....

56:16.940 --> 56:20.879
we will meet in hell!

56:20.880 --> 56:23.279
Professor, so?

56:23.280 --> 56:26.959
Not yet!
30 seconds before the complete deciphering.

56:26.960 --> 56:30.819
Ok! find the receiver first!

56:30.820 --> 56:36.499
Understood! i'll keep you ted,
there is not much time left.

56:36.500 --> 56:38.979
Yes, the clock is running!

56:38.980 --> 56:41.299
It's finished.....

56:41.300 --> 56:43.499
he hanged?

56:49.360 --> 56:51.760
Right here, cool kid!

56:51.860 --> 56:53.959
Read this, hurry!

56:56.840 --> 56:59.039
But this.....

57:01.720 --> 57:03.060
Kir!

57:04.040 --> 57:06.739
What is it, Kir?

57:06.740 --> 57:08.739
Do you something to say?

57:08.740 --> 57:10.739
It's now the time for it, don't you think?

57:10.740 --> 57:13.319
We've told you we are your allies!

57:13.320 --> 57:17.799
Don't waste your time, i
know that you aren't.

57:17.800 --> 57:20.739
I'm giving you one minute.

57:20.740 --> 57:24.639
Your last chance to prove
your innocence....

57:24.640 --> 57:27.899
rats are a nuisance

57:27.900 --> 57:30.719
Vodka. the countdown.

57:30.720 --> 57:32.719
Understood

57:36.880 --> 57:39.439
We are on your side, don't you understand?

57:39.440 --> 57:43.759
What if that girl put our
name to get ride of us?

57:43.760 --> 57:46.599
Bring her here, to confirm her mistake!

57:46.600 --> 57:47.719
50.

57:47.720 --> 57:49.919
That's a way to see things.

57:49.920 --> 57:52.619
But i'm not going to be
clement to that extend.

57:52.620 --> 57:54.619
Kir....

57:58.440 --> 58:01.899
You've lived long enough
for the organization.

58:01.900 --> 58:06.439
I have no idea why would my
name be in the NOC's list!

58:06.440 --> 58:07.479
Neither do i! i'm not a spy

58:12.840 --> 58:14.839
Well.... 20.

58:14.840 --> 58:16.839
Which one should i start with?

58:16.840 --> 58:19.579
You're not serious?

58:19.580 --> 58:22.099
I asked which one should i start with!

58:22.100 --> 58:25.399
10,9,8,7... so?
Kir, Bourbon?

58:25.400 --> 58:27.399
Six, five...

58:27.400 --> 58:29.399
four, three, two.
I'm starting with you....

58:29.400 --> 58:31.399
2,1...

58:31.400 --> 58:32.599
zero

58:32.600 --> 58:33.979
bourbon

58:50.960 --> 58:52.959
What's going on?

58:52.960 --> 58:54.959
Kir, Bourbon!

58:54.960 --> 58:57.159
Don't move!

58:58.800 --> 59:00.799
Bourbon is not there anymore!
He run away!

59:00.800 --> 59:02.999
But how!

59:05.020 --> 59:07.219
Find him!

59:12.340 --> 59:14.339
Sorry, Kir....

59:14.340 --> 59:16.719
the 1st rat run away.

59:16.720 --> 59:19.219
But don't worry.

59:19.220 --> 59:22.559
I'll take care of you right now.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.739
Goodbye, Kir....

59:24.740 --> 59:27.039
no! don't kill her!

59:27.040 --> 59:29.039
It's Rum's orders

59:29.040 --> 59:31.440
yes, that's what we are going to do...

59:32.320 --> 59:33.599
understood.

59:35.500 --> 59:38.279
Rum received an e-mail from Curacao.

59:38.280 --> 59:41.219
They had nothing to do with the NOC's list.

59:41.220 --> 59:43.679
She recovered her memory?

59:43.680 --> 59:48.339
We told you.
We are victims from a conspiracy

59:48.340 --> 59:51.579
you're not going to
remove the cuffs already?

59:51.580 --> 59:53.579
No.

59:53.580 --> 59:56.019
It's a direct order from rum

59:56.020 --> 01:00:01.539
we must find curacao to confirm if
the mail was really sent by her.

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.659
She must be in the police
hospital, but under protection.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.659
You're absolutely sure of this?

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:13.579
She's certainly our ally, but it
seems that she's on the move.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:19.839
Nice timing, Gin.

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.279
We were spying on the PSB'S
agents for a while now.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.039
I'm sure you did.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.839
My finger is itching me

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.839
where is the target?

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.979
It's as you said.

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:36.299
Curacao is getting in a police car.

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.299
Don't kill them yet.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.299
Don't tell me that....

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.879
we are going to let them do the job.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.879
It's a chance.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.199
It's really getting exciting,
with you, it's like a war!

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.299
We must apply the right method....

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.799
Rum's orders.

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:55.799
Ok!

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.799
Awesome, that's exciting!

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.879
This pressure is making me excited!

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.619
But still, this is troublesome.....

01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:05.679
gin, you're not serious?

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.539
I wasn't able to find him, boss.
He got away.

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.539
Whatever.

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.919
We will take care of bourbon and Kir later.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.919
Curacao is our top priority

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:19.319
but the cops are still in the hospital!

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.639
She's not in the hospital anymore.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:27.239
Where is she then? she's going straight
to the Tôto aquarium right now.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:31.219
Gin, you're not going to...
do that in a place like that!

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.859
Does it really matter?

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.059
Start the car yes

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.039
Understood inform the bureau.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.319
We will be in contact.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.019
Well received.

01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:48.019
They are safe.

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.019
Thanks god!

01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:53.539
Awesome. he did a good job!

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.539
In cooperating!

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:58.219
It's because this mail were sent to them!

01:01:58.220 --> 01:02:04.239
We can take care of the
rest, they are out of harm.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.379
We can act freely! yes

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:10.179
no! things are not solved yet.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.819
The enemy must have put bombs in the park.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.519
Maybe, they are going to kill her soon

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.519
she's not in the police hospital?

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:21.819
No, she asked to be driven to the aquarium.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.439
The aquarium? let's go then

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.479
no! let's leave this to Akai.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.839
We are not going to put ourselves
in danger for nothing,

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.839
but we will recover the NOC's list data.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.379
Yes
and conan, do you have something to say?

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.139
Anything that would've been missed.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.139
But... well don't worry

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:45.519
the FBI will be there to cover you.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.659
I'm counting on you then!

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.819
Yes. we will contact you when we know more.

01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.219
Now that i think about it!

01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:00.219
How come Akai knows a lot
of recent information?

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.219
We exchange information regularly

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.859
he heard about Curacao thanks to Bourbon,
when he infiltrated the syndicate.

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.139
So he was involved in this case.

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:10.339
Thanks, take care of yourself.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:17.099
So that girl isn't Rum but curacao.

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:21.479
But she can be related to
Curacao's different colors

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.279
it exists with a diversity of colors

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.899
an orange curacao, a
blue, and green ones...?

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:31.099
Or a red curacao?

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.839
But then, is it...

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:39.559
it's exactly what i've been thinking!

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.499
But did i see them before....?

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.499
Try to remember.....

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:49.119
yes, at that time!

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.799
Yes, they are chromed lenses

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.319
answer, please.

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.999
Stout, Aquavit.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.999
Riesling

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.959
yes, the organization is waiting for the
PBS to solve the mystery by themselves!

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.739
But then... damn it!

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:15.559
If i don't hurry, the organization
is going to recover the list!

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.399
Yes, i've recovered her

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.339
so do you have any plan?

01:04:27.340 --> 01:04:29.779
No, but we cannot stand back anymore.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:31.779
I'll leave it to you, bring her back.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.779
Good luck

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.279
yes, i'll do it as fast as i can.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.819
Pay attention, the syndicate's
eyes are everywhere.

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.819
I'll contact you later.

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.819
We will be in touch

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:45.020
wait, Furuya!

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:57.519
Gosh...\Nwhy should i come?
And to babysit some brats!

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:00.159
Here we are, at last!

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:02.159
Get out, hurry.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.439
We arrived! yes... awesome

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.319
wait a bit, don't go far away!

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:10.319
Yeees!

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:14.299
What are you doing dad? you've disturbed
my sleep, so i'm taking a nap right now

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:17.239
i'll wait in the car, have fun!

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.439
Thanks!

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.779
I'll go and see around.

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.979
There are going to the aquarium?

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:38.079
It's exactly here where she
was found after the pile-up.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.279
They must have a reason to bring her here.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.599
This place must have a hidden
secret related to her past.

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:48.199
Whatever, let's keep watching
the place for a bit. yes

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.139
Sonoko is still not here!

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:53.139
Yes, i thought she would be here already.

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:54.959
I would like to ride the gigantic wheel.

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:59.839
Sorry, all the tickets
have been sold today.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.479
I'm from the PSB

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.759
it's better to let us in.
Ran! right here!

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.160
Sir, it's inappropriate.....

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:12.520
she is here! sorry for being late.
i've been

01:06:12.545 --> 01:06:15.319
going around here and i
didn't see the time.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.859
That's not a problem!
Thanks for accepting our request!

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:22.339
You're going to pay me back, aren't you?
Yes!

01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.759
Sorry for making you come here.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:28.299
No, don't worry about that.

01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:31.059
You're going to take care
of the kids, right? yes!

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:35.119
Well, follow me to the wheel.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.520
Yes! awesome!

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:40.679
Is it ok with you?

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:44.139
No, this woman is
like my guardian angel!

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:47.719
By the way, do you have
any news of shinichi?

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.439
No... what is it?

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.439
No, it's nothing

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.439
what do you know them?

01:06:53.440 --> 01:07:00.479
No, but i have the feeling that i have already
seen the lady though i don't know where.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:05.280
What's wrong with these guys?
Yes, it seems that something is happening.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:10.379
Hey there, you're alright?

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.619
Let's go!

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:17.379
Sorry Sonoko...
but i think that the guys from earlier.....

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:21.740
why don't you take this
chance and call him?

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.619
Damn, it's my other phone

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.820
Ran mouri incoming call

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:40.039
yo, Ran! shinichi!

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.039
It's too important but...

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.039
what, i don't have much time!

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.879
Sorry, you're in a hur....

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:47.319
yes, we can say that.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.439
You're talking to him!

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.199
Hey, hey! stop it!

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.839
Sorry ran, i have to hung up. see you!

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:58.099
Wait! shinichi!
I'll call you back

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.259
but what are you... where are you?

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:06.679
This guys, between his "i'm in a
hurry" and "i'll call you back"..

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.579
Anyway, what can you do about that.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:12.179
But i think he's here.

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:16.919
Here?
I've heard his voice on the speaker.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.919
Of course....

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:21.439
he's cheating on you.

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:25.859
Do you think that a man comes
to places like this alone?

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:29.919
Well, let's look for the bastard!
Wait!

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.399
Sonoko!

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:38.198
It's a shame that we had to come to this...

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.059
we've known each other for a long time.

01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.460
What a waste.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.499
Finished. it's up to you now to
make sure everything goes right.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:56.499
Good job.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:09:00.419
Faster. we don't the
right to make a mistake.

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.819
Understood, let's go.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.738
You're having a good time tonight?

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:13.779
We are happy to welcome
you to the maritime park!

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:18.679
A visual show will be on the
wheel during the night.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:24.080
Be on the line in the 3rd zone
to guaranty a place for it.

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:27.618
Well, come on.

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.559
Awesome!
We've got special places!

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.899
Pay attention, kids!

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:36.658
Who are these kids?
They are Suzuki's guests.

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.139
I see

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.487
our humble clients are
prayed to follow our

01:09:40.511 --> 01:09:42.964
instructions. you don't
have to do that much.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.839
Damn it, i'm looking every
where but without success!

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.500
Whatever, i need to hurry!

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.960
But what's going on?

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.579
That's quiet the number!

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.119
Just what's going on?

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.119
Is it sible that....

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.119
where are you ...?

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.439
That car....

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.039
i was sure!

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:31.299
Thanks for waiting.

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.539
Wouldn't you be by chance.....

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.539
yes, it's us

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.539
my apologies

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:43.599
we've let some children in, so
there will be a 10 minutes line.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.859
What is it? is there a problem?

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.559
No, it's just kids, so it's ok.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:52.739
What matters is to bring her
to the top of the wheel,

01:10:52.740 --> 01:10:57.199
before they got the chance to get her back.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.819
We have to do it. yes!

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.220
Let's go

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:06.539
excuse me, my friend are inside!

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.159
Move a bit, sorry!

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.519
Wait, don't go in!

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:15.219
Pay attention in where you're going!

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:18.020
Damn it, i'm too late!

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:25.320
Excuse me, let me pass!

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.899
The syndicate haven't had the
chance to come here yet.

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:39.339
But if they do what i'm
thinking to the woman...

01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:42.639
I'd better hurry.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.040
I need to inform the PSB and the FBI!

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.279
It's... Akai!

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.279
Wait, that ceiling....

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.279
these cables ...!

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.819
But then... this is really bad!

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.920
This is no good, i need to go and see that!

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.400
Here you are.

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.599
Curacao is in the cabin.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.599
The PSB is with her.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.779
At the top of the wheel in 10 minutes.

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:13.819
10 minutes... how is it going there?

01:12:13.820 --> 01:12:15.819
Everything is fine.

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:17.819
And on your side?

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:21.319
The cops don't seem to be willing to move.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.519
But it would be bad if
they decide to come out.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:26.799
In that case, i'll say
that it's your fault.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.799
Understood.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.179
Vermin, you're going to make me
believe that you've lost your memory

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:36.459
yes... never mind then.

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:39.219
I'm here to recover what's on your head

01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:41.439
you're the one who stole the NOC's list.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.220
But your organization interests me a lot.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:51.940
With this, it should be alright.

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:01.700
You came.

01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:09.619
I'm been having a hard time,
you're good at running.

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:13.520
The one who came to act as a
diversion, so it was you.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.239
What's going on?

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.859
I was able to free myself
thanks to a hair pin.

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:30.739
Kir, bourbon
i was planning on running when i heard...

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:35.219
someone opening the
door in an apparent way.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:38.580
I understood that you wanted to make a
diversion and have the enemy go far away

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:43.039
i've taken that chance
to run on the darkness,

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.720
and i figure out that you
were behind all this.

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:53.339
Let me however, ask you some questions.

01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:55.339
What was your goal by saving us?

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.339
To confuse us?

01:13:57.340 --> 01:14:00.419
To help us?

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:03.779
Or just a way to recover some information?

01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:07.939
Is this the right place
to discuss all this?

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:11.939
Yes, it's the only reason
for the FBI to be here.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:16.959
Because Curacao belongs to the PSB.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.239
It's a no.

01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:21.639
In that case let's solve
this with bare hands.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.260
Come here, Akai shuichi!

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.799
It's certainly the code
that is behind all this.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.799
But it's still weird.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.799
Am i missing something?

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.200
What is this?

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.159
A detonator!

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:57.019
They must have placed some other
bombs in different places!

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.819
No... i need to move right now.

01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:02.943
The bomb or the detonator...
if i make a mistake

01:15:02.968 --> 01:15:05.004
about one or the other,
it's gonna be the end!

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.540
Yes, i need to find that person!

01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:16.619
How is that sible?

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.020
Wait, what is thi...?

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.520
But why did the kids....!

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.599
You're making a mistake.

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.819
This woman mustn't stay
in your hands right now.

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:48.819
Yes, yes, so that you could use
the info against the syndicate?

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:51.220
I'm not letting you!

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.419
And so?

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:15.359
What would you do if Curacao recovered her
memory and talked to the organization?

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.359
This has nothing to do with you.

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.400
The info will be in the PSB's hands
before she could even make a move!

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.419
Damn it, where did Akai go?

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.220
He's not answering!

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:43.979
Right there on the top?!

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.380
But how?

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:06.640
I'm not giving up!

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:10.860
Tired already?

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:16.139
I'll keep going until the end, Akai!

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.139
Akai! i'm on the bottom!

01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:21.819
I need you!
They don't want to spare Curacao!

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:24.819
They are going to bomb the wheel!

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:27.859
Please, i need your help there!

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:31.599
We have to take care of it,
before they blow it up!

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.599
It's really urgent!

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.599
Hurry!

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.319
Conan, is that true?
Amuro, how did you get there?

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.219
Let's talk about that later.
Where is the bomb?

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:45.459
It is placed in many hosepipes shelves!

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:48.479
I don't get how they are
going to be triggered,

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.560
but we need to act very quickly!

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.200
Understood! contact the FBI and tell them!

01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:02.300
That was magnificent!

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.799
Don't lose hope Ran!
We are going to find him for sure!

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:13.719
But this is not the problem what am i
going to do if i catch him red-handed?

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.099
Seriously RAN, you have no tenacity!

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.499
You need to be angry and scold him!

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.499
What are you talking about?

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:26.739
We haven't searched the
most romantic place!

01:18:26.740 --> 01:18:28.739
Where?

01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:31.259
There! on your left!

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:35.040
The aquarium! exactly!

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.820
So, Amuro? not yet.

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.459
With this, everything should be fine.

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:53.039
So, it was really a trap.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.000
Yes, you were right to look around here.

01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:59.959
Akai what about the bombs?

01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:03.899
There are some strong explosives
put in some strategic places.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:09.059
They make an orange light
when they explode.

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:11.059
Of course.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.559
Nothing is surprising if it's them.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.559
This is it!

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:19.699
What is it?

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.619
No problem, i can take care of that.

01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:27.579
I understand how it works
you know how to defuse bombs?

01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:31.400
I learned a lot of things
in the police academy.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:35.879
I was under the wing of one
of the academy's best!

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.879
But, despite this,

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.119
he ended up dying in one defusing attempt.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.919
A deminer dying by explosion...?

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:48.639
Don't worry
i have got everything under control.

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.639
You will see.

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:53.040
Use this.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.959
From now on... i'm letting
you take care of this.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.585
Where are you going?

01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:04.459
This building is probably not
the only one filled with bombs.

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:08.219
There is a sibility that they are
trying to get rid of Curacao.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.839
There could be some in the wheel.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.839
Of course!

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:16.979
Yes, i'll try to gain
some time by going there.

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.880
Take care of the bombs.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:23.259
Easier said then done.

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:26.239
Here, take this. thanks.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.239
As for him, he can talk....

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.779
we don't know how many time can we save!

01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:34.759
Yes, we don't know when
they are going to blow up.

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:38.600
But wait! there are
certainly going to come!

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.799
What is it conan?
I'm going to protect the NOC's list!

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.760
These two are alike!

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:59.619
This is!

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.619
This is why she remembered the NOC's list.

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:05.359
This is why they want
her to be on the wheel.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:11.899
If my deduction is correct, she will
remember the list when she sees the colors!

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:16.419
Her memory is an important
stake for the syndicate....

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:20.419
and.... if she remembers
all the information,

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.419
the syndicate's doors are going
to be opened for her again!

01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:25.579
But if she remembers,

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.839
all the people around her
are going to be in danger!

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.240
It's almost time.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:38.939
Gin, get ready. there are three
minutes and five seconds left.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:42.739
Ready! ready, we can proceed.

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.739
Chianti!

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:48.819
We are almost near the zone.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.220
Ok!

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:58.379
I need to hurry, if i slow down, it's over!

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:01.140
After this all i have to do is...

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:07.260
it's ok that was close.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.239
This guy is still lightning me...

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:15.079
i was able to avoid the worst trap....

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.399
Matsuda.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:20.179
What does this mean? she's
not doing anything!

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:22.879
She doesn't make any reaction.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:26.760
Furuya, then, would be mistaken?

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:41.200
What's going on?

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.740
Hold on.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:55.079
A reaction! her memory is coming back?

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.499
But how did this.....

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.779
calm down, sit!

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:03.180
Stay calm!

01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:14.099
Don't even try to run, Curacao.

01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:19.179
This is what happen when we don't
accomplish well the syndicate mission.

01:23:19.180 --> 01:23:22.579
I must admit that you're impressing me.

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:27.239
To make so many mistakes,
with such high potential.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:29.939
But we need to do what should be done.

01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:34.839
This is why i don't have a choice.
This is your destiny.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:38.440
Goodbye, Curacao.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:41.659
Wait.

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:44.060
What is th.....

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.799
what are you doing here?

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.200
Don't even think about it, Vermouth

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:02.439
Curacao, you've got talent.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:05.899
You could be useful for the syndicate.

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:07.899
Rum!

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:10.820
I'll keep you here for a while.

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:25.380
You're going to work for me, Curacao!

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.859
Are you alright? get a hold of yourself!

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:35.459
Don't move
i'm calling an ambulance.

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.860
It won't be necessary!

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:48.339
At last, you came back...

01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:52.019
i've got Curacao in front of me.

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:55.759
2 minutes before the beginning of the plan.

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.699
Don't you think it's time to go?

01:24:58.700 --> 01:25:02.420
Vodka, the crane. understood.

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:05.980
The crane is out.

01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:24.740
That engine... it's coming closer

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.780
but what do they still have in mind?

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.420
The phone?

01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:53.539
Who is it?
It's been a while, Vermouth.

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:56.539
Like i suspected, you
recovered your memory.

01:25:56.540 --> 01:25:59.539
Yes, but excluding this....

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:02.819
i've good the feeling
that i'm being spied on.

01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:05.979
No problem, Gin is coming to
recover you in a helicopter.

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:07.979
Gin?

01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:10.839
Else, do you remember all your memories?

01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:12.839
Did you send Rum a mail?

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:17.839
If it appears that it's not you....

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:22.979
of course i'm the one who sent it.

01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:24.979
A problem?

01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:28.819
Kir and bourbon were able
to run because of that.

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:31.760
Their time will come any way.

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:38.760
Now if you would like,
wait for your carriage. ok

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:45.080
four... three....two....one... zero

01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.519
what is th....?

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.819
No, they have already started it!

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:06.559
Vermouth have started the plan.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:11.459
Well received.
We are starting the plan! catch Curacao!

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:13.860
Yes, sir!

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:16.999
Keep your calm, please!

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.919
Please...
you're making fun of us!

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:24.799
Stay calm!
I'm frightened!

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:26.799
We are getting out!

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:30.200
Everyone, let's go to the doors!
No, you have to stay here!

01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:42.099
But where the hell are they?
I need to find them!

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.399
What's going on again?

01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.119
It's disturbing, all these people....
i can't see very well

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.919
do we move? maybe. it's useless, we
will not do much in this situation.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.099
Sato, Takagi!

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:01.239
As i suspected, the PSB
is in a secret mission.

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.299
I was sure!
But what are we suped to do?

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:07.599
Help the citizens here.
But what about the PSB?

01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.679
There is no "but", we have
to sort out our priorities!

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.340
Is it clear? yes!

01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:17.939
He doesn't seem to be here.

01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.819
Sorry to waste your time with this.

01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:24.000
Hey, we need to get out of here,
there is a problem outside!

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.399
Let us pass! sorry!

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.739
This is... what does this means?

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:35.019
These bombs are difficult to defuse!

01:28:35.020 --> 01:28:37.919
In addition, i have only
a little time left...

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.840
i should not let myself be pressured!

01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:53.120
Are you going to wait calmly
for the Organization here?

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:02.180
No, surely they are not going to...

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:07.100
this is...

01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:14.240
we're getting closer
we will reach her soon, let's go!

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:20.899
A PSB agent?

01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.499
It's as i thought, they are after Curacao!

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.900
No!

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.560
Sir wake up! sir!

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.839
This sniper is not good enough....

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:39.180
i need another spot.

01:29:58.380 --> 01:30:00.259
I can't do a thing from here.

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:02.259
Well, here we go.

01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:04.859
Well received
there is a problem.

01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:07.879
The target isn't in sigh
as it was predicted.

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.879
The secret police would
have already gotten her?

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.940
Scan the surrounding. understood

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.779
there is only an unconscious type....

01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:18.779
and a kid with him!

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:21.339
Boss, Curacao run away!

01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:23.999
What? Curacao...

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.999
let that pod down

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.100
understood!

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:31.640
It's moving?

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:47.439
Gin, what's going on?
Curacao disappeared.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.659
What? we're changing the plan.

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:54.559
We look for Curacao!
I was sure, she betrayed us.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.559
She should have thought
about it before escaping.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.559
She will pay for it.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.559
Find her immediately!

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:03.919
Understood.
Chianti, you get closer from the top.

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:07.339
Understood!
Korn, aim at the target.

01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:09.040
Ok.

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:25.380
No,

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:37.399
what, you want to bring me to them?

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:40.379
"them"... you mean the syndicate?

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:42.919
Her memory is really back.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:46.960
Wouldn't you be the traitor sherry?

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:51.619
It's going to be dangerous in here.
You should run.

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:53.619
What do you mean "run"?

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:56.559
Stop joking! Gin is coming!

01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.819
I think that you get what it means.

01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:01.819
But why did you.....

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:05.619
i don't know
i don't know why i'm saving you.

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:10.179
But i've been wondering
what Curacao's color i was.

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:14.159
But my old self, was she
better then the one right now?

01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:17.240
That's all i wanna know!

01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:21.720
Well, now, go away, sherry.

01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.319
Wait.

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.999
The kids with whom you were in the pod.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.400
We must help them!

01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:33.639
I don't understand the
integrity of the diffuser.

01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:36.959
Well, i should be able to do it.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:40.779
Concentrate, do it for him...

01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:43.180
hurry, faster...!

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:45.880
Sir?

01:32:46.700 --> 01:32:49.240
Sir, hold on!

01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.860
Hold on!

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:57.879
Still nothing?

01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:59.879
You still haven't found it yet?

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:05.059
No, she's unfindable, there
is only a kid and two others!

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:07.059
It's no good, boss!

01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:09.659
They are defusing the bombs!

01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:11.659
What? this one!

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:15.340
I'm sure he wasn't there before!

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.939
The PSB is already on the move.

01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:23.160
Only two cables left.

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:28.940
With this, it will end!

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.180
Gosh.

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:41.760
That was a close call.

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:53.659
I'm taking control of everything, Korn

01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:56.060
you, fire immediately

01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:01.479
blow up everything on your side, Korn!

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:03.880
I know.

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.160
Just what's going on?

01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:16.600
Damn it, something must be done!

01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:22.499
This is bad!

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:25.940
I will not be able to aim.

01:34:28.220 --> 01:34:30.073
Ran, the kids aren't answering.

01:34:30.098 --> 01:34:33.599
There is nothing we can do,
we don't know where they are!

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:36.159
I hope the kids are ok.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:38.159
Hurry, jump

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.560
go.

01:34:55.180 --> 01:34:58.459
Damn it, if thing keeps going like this,

01:34:58.460 --> 01:35:00.860
i won't be able to save the kids!

01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:03.819
Leave them to me.

01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:06.959
Don"t tell me that you're going to....

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.959
i'm leaving the kids to you

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.360
don't do it, they are going to kill you

01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:18.059
boss, that figure....

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.460
it's Curacao!

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.619
I need to concentrate until the right time.

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.919
It stopped!

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:31.320
Someone must have made a diversion!

01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:36.460
Die, Curacao!

01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:00.420
She....

01:36:02.860 --> 01:36:05.119
Curacao was wounded.

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:07.119
Mission accomplished.

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.119
No, maybe she's still alive.

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:11.739
Blow up the bombs.

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:14.499
We must blow up the wheel's axle.

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.499
The axle?

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:23.799
Yes, if Curacao is still alive, she
won't be if she's crushed by the wheel.

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.959
The PSB would be disappointed
to see that she disappeared.

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:30.519
Korn, fire again!

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.299
Hurry up and crush her into pieces!

01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:35.700
Yes, understood.

01:36:37.300 --> 01:36:39.000
Haibara!

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:43.139
You're not hurt?
What's happening? Ai!

01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:45.139
What is going on?

01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:47.139
I'll explain later.

01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:49.139
But, we have to stay calm.

01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:51.139
Akai!

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.959
Amuro! are you there?

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:56.360
Yes. Akai!

01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:00.979
You're not hurt, kid? no

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:05.020
hold on, it's not finished yet.

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.399
Where is Amuro? no idea.

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:11.619
But seeing how they changed their strategy,

01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:13.619
he must have diffused the bombs.

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:16.559
What are they going to do now?

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:18.559
Maybe you want my rifle?

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.559
Amuro!

01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:23.599
We must counter-attack,

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:26.839
FBI! i can't help it

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.679
my rifle's sigh is damaged.

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:33.699
My other sigh isn't good
enough to aim well,

01:37:33.700 --> 01:37:37.179
and it's too dark to aim as well

01:37:37.180 --> 01:37:39.819
can you aim with enough light?
Yes!

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.819
But how do we make them go down?

01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:44.219
By using the rotor's fragility.

01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:46.659
You can see them from here?

01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.659
With this jet black sky, no.

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:55.099
But by aiming at the rotor,
with enough light, yes.

01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.539
I can illuminate the sky,

01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:01.420
but i need a source of light to aim well.

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:10.959
It's them again?
They intend to destroy everything?

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:14.700
They must have another objective.

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:20.000
This is bad, half of the bombs can blow up!

01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:22.980
Die, all of you!

01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:29.159
Damn it, i don't know what i'm suped to do,

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:31.799
use this to aim!

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.200
What?

01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:37.880
Catch this!

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:47.720
I can see it!

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.320
Goooooo!

01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:17.259
That light... what was that?
Fire works?

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:19.799
We've been hit! what's this?

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:22.200
Where the hell is it coming from?

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:26.960
Now!

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.499
It's alright!

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:36.980
Yes!

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:47.539
Damn it, i'm losing control!

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:49.460
Korn, move!

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:54.020
Damn it!

01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:58.860
It's bad, if they keep going like this!

01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:40.760
It's imsible, we're going to crash!

01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:45.200
Ruuuun!

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:55.580
It's bad! at this rate, all the
aquarium is going to be...!

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.519
Who were these guys?

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:08.639
They tried to kill us,
but it's not the time yet

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:13.559
ladies and gentleman, take
shelter in the stadium!

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:18.100
What is... Ran, we need to go!

01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:33.079
That can be true, the wheel will not hold!

01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:35.079
Conan!

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:37.079
Amuro!

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:41.460
Can you stop it?
I don't know, i'll try!

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:47.899
Amuro!

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:50.300
It's alright, don't worry!

01:41:51.660 --> 01:41:53.840
Here we go!

01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:04.600
Mooooove!

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.619
Akai!

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:13.020
Do you need help?

01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:33.060
Damn it!

01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:38.520
It alright, it's... wait, no!

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:45.600
You're sure?
Yes, it's gonna work!

01:42:48.260 --> 01:42:49.900
Kudo....

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:55.400
damn it, it not gonna get through

01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.899
catch my hands

01:42:57.900 --> 01:43:00.300
Akai

01:43:08.420 --> 01:43:12.060
and here... we go!

01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:15.199
What?

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:19.899
What is th...
more, we need more power!

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:25.240
It's not working! run away!

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:29.320
We are getting faster!

01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:54.340
The kids...

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:03.160
i won't let it happen like this!

01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:24.119
It's not moving anymore?
We are saved!

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.520
Conan saved us!

01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:39.459
But how...
how could the straps stop this?

01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:41.459
But the wheel....

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:43.779
who stopped it?

01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:46.860
Good job..., kid.

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:01.759
Wait!
We are going to examine it.

01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.375
Sorry i'm looking for someone.

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.659
A person disappeared and i want
to make sure that she's ok.

01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:10.520
Well, you can go now.

01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:15.000
But this is.... yes.

01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.039
Kid.

01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.440
Is it related to her amnesia?

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:24.439
What's that?
An important evidence, maybe!

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:26.439
No

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:29.740
It has nothing to do with her amnesia.
It's a memory.

01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:34.720
A dark memory.

i almost did it! you suck!

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.999
It's Genta, who's saying this?

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.539
You're not the right person to say this!
What is that? i'll show you!

01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:09.539
That woman...

01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:13.079
she saved us, didn't she? yes...

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:17.659
i didn't except her to die like this.

01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:20.419
But why did she...

01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:22.419
save us....

01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:24.899
yes, we've won a price!

01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:26.899
We're got our key holders!

01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:28.899
I'm happy to have one!

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:32.639
Isn't it!
Yeah, everyone has his own, isn't it?

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:34.639
Here is mine! and mine!

01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:39.319
Awesome.
But all this make me feel sad

01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:43.179
now that she recovered her memory,
she got back to her home...

01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:47.299
i'm wondering if we are still her friend.
Yes...

01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:49.299
well...

01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:54.739
she is still remembering you without doubt.
You're her real friend, aren't you?

01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:56.739
You're right! yes!

01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:01.960
Right! no matter what... they
should never know the truth.

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:05.259
Until the end...

01:51:05.260 --> 01:51:07.660
that lady's color, it was....
