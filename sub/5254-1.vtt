00:00.063 --> 00:01.325
Last season on Faking It...

00:01.327 --> 00:02.921
You know how I've always
wanted lesbian friends?

00:02.923 --> 00:04.341
They're perfect.

00:04.343 --> 00:06.590
Let's elect them Homecoming Queens.

00:06.592 --> 00:07.705
All hail the Queens!

00:07.707 --> 00:09.374
Since we came out, everyone loves us.

00:09.376 --> 00:11.543
Small problem, we're not gay.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.263
Way to sell it.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.714
I am overflowing with joy.

00:16.716 --> 00:18.349
How did your mother take the news?

00:18.351 --> 00:19.684
Lesbians?

00:19.686 --> 00:21.636
Karma and I are faking being lesbians.

00:21.638 --> 00:23.721
Karma is. I'm not so sure.

00:23.723 --> 00:25.223
Guess who's having a sexy
secret affair with Liam Booker.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.225
- Here's a clue, it's me.
- Are you kidding?

00:27.227 --> 00:29.611
- Amy is okay with this?
- 100%.

00:29.613 --> 00:31.613
Karma is in denial.

00:31.615 --> 00:33.615
From now on, nothing but the truth.

00:33.617 --> 00:34.866
- Deal?
- I've got nothing to hide.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.401
Then tell me about the pills you take

00:36.403 --> 00:38.319
all the time that you
don't want anyone to see.

00:38.321 --> 00:39.988
You've fallen in love
with your best friend.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.073
Why don't you just tell her how you feel?

00:42.075 --> 00:44.576
- I love you.
- I slept with Liam.

00:44.578 --> 00:47.495
I shared a secret with
Tommy, and he dumped me.

00:47.497 --> 00:49.047
I should've told you a long time ago.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.748
I never thought it would get this far.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.134
Well, I told Amy about us, didn't go well.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.921
It must be hard to break up
with your fake girlfriend.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.063
Oh, [Bleep].

01:22.065 --> 01:23.264
Oh, [Bleep].

01:23.266 --> 01:25.099
That's what I said.

01:25.101 --> 01:28.019
- We...
- Yeah, we did.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.237
[Bleep].

01:29.239 --> 01:32.273
Amy?

01:32.275 --> 01:34.359
Are you up yet? Can I come in?

01:34.361 --> 01:37.028
I'd really like to talk.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.453
- Go, go!
- My clothes!

01:45.455 --> 01:47.038
I'm not going to let you shut me out.

01:48.592 --> 01:51.793
Amy, I'm coming in.

01:51.795 --> 01:54.545
I have been the worst best friend ever.

01:54.547 --> 01:55.880
I had no idea this whole time

01:55.882 --> 01:58.049
that you've been having these feelings.

01:58.051 --> 01:59.550
Must have been torture.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.769
Yeah, wasn't fun.

02:01.771 --> 02:03.187
Um, can we talk about this later?

02:03.189 --> 02:05.139
I am so deeply sorry.

02:05.141 --> 02:07.942
I made it all about me and
my crush on some silly boy,

02:07.944 --> 02:10.311
who by the way, now hates me
for not being a real lesbian,

02:10.312 --> 02:12.146
so you two have that in common.

02:12.148 --> 02:13.481
I don't hate you.

02:13.483 --> 02:15.950
You should. I'm a terrible person.

02:15.952 --> 02:19.404
Oh, I really am not in a place to judge.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.872
- There I go again.
- What?

02:20.874 --> 02:23.157
Making it all about me. See?

02:23.159 --> 02:24.659
Worst best friend ever.

02:24.661 --> 02:27.745
But I promise from now
on, I'm all about you.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.380
Tell me about the rest of your night.

02:29.382 --> 02:32.667
Did you cry yourself to sleep like I did?

02:32.669 --> 02:34.836
I just... I had so much to drink,

02:34.838 --> 02:37.588
and I have this crushing hangover.

02:37.590 --> 02:39.924
- Can we talk about this later?
- W...

02:39.926 --> 02:41.759
Well, here, why don't you throw this on,

02:41.761 --> 02:44.762
and we'll get a greasy
breakfast in you, stat?

02:44.764 --> 02:46.180
I can't.

02:46.182 --> 02:48.516
Amy, I'm not letting you pull away.

02:48.518 --> 02:49.984
We're spending the rest
of our lives together,

02:49.986 --> 02:52.153
so we just... We have to work this out.

02:52.155 --> 02:53.655
Okay? Talk it out.

02:53.657 --> 02:57.025
Okay, and we will. We
will, just not right now.

Is Amy up?

03:07.120 --> 03:08.336
I have to drive Nana home,

03:08.338 --> 03:10.004
and she promised to run interference.

03:10.006 --> 03:13.591
I am not in the mood for my
mother's constructive criticism.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.293
I could go if you want. Old people love me.

03:15.295 --> 03:16.711
I share their values.

03:16.713 --> 03:18.546
Oh, you are just too kind,

03:18.548 --> 03:22.767
but I could never ask you to...

03:22.769 --> 03:26.137
Oh, my God.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.138
What is it?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.691
Uh...

03:29.693 --> 03:33.061
Uh, just saw the time. Gotta run.

03:33.063 --> 03:35.863
So much to do before we
fly to Cancun tonight.

03:35.865 --> 03:38.399
- I'll go get Amy.
- Oh, let her sleep.

03:38.401 --> 03:39.867
She had a late night.

03:39.869 --> 03:43.571
I can handle Nana.

03:43.573 --> 03:45.990
Is everything okay?

03:45.992 --> 03:50.795
Oh, everything is perfect. This is perfect.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.514
Oh!

04:01.507 --> 04:05.143
Hey, we missed the sunrise.

04:05.145 --> 04:08.513
Good thing there's another one tomorrow.

04:15.521 --> 04:18.689
I see a lot of cold showers in my future.

04:18.690 --> 04:21.108
Ugh!

04:22.961 --> 04:28.298
This is not happening. I won't allow it.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.801
Like she can do that.

04:30.803 --> 04:32.769
- What?
- You need to apologize.

04:32.771 --> 04:35.889
But I don't wanna.

04:35.891 --> 04:37.808
See, this is one of those
times where you can choose

04:37.810 --> 04:40.644
to feed the good wolf or the bad wolf.

04:40.646 --> 04:42.362
Fine, I'll do it,

04:42.364 --> 04:46.283
but only because you're so
cute when you talk about wolves.

04:46.285 --> 04:48.652
Millions of women have
used the morning-after pill

04:48.654 --> 04:52.205
with no reports of serious complications.

04:52.207 --> 04:53.907
Do you have a pill for my guilt?

04:53.909 --> 04:56.043
I just made the biggest mistake of my life.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.912
- We're not here to judge.
- I deserve to be judged.

04:58.914 --> 05:00.797
Last night, I told my
best friend, "I love you,"

05:00.799 --> 05:02.466
and when she rejected me, I got drunk

05:02.468 --> 05:03.667
and slept with her boyfriend.

05:03.669 --> 05:06.136
Do you think I should tell her?

05:06.138 --> 05:09.389
- You're judging me.
- No, no judgment, I promise.

05:09.391 --> 05:11.258
I just want to remind you
that these won't protect you

05:11.260 --> 05:12.426
against sexually transmitted infections.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.679
Just when I thought my
day couldn't get any worse.

05:15.681 --> 05:18.148
Hey, you.

05:18.150 --> 05:21.518
Hey. Um, this is my best friend.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.986
What are you doing here?

05:22.988 --> 05:25.856
Don't be creeped out,
but I followed you here.

05:25.858 --> 05:30.110
I just... I really think we
should talk about last night.

05:30.112 --> 05:32.746
- What's that?
- It's for my mom.

05:32.748 --> 05:34.464
They're going to Mexico on their honeymoon,

05:34.466 --> 05:36.700
and she doesn't want to
spend it on the toilet.

05:36.702 --> 05:38.986
Well, do you want to walk back together?

05:38.988 --> 05:40.938
We could talk.

05:42.707 --> 05:45.258
Now really isn't a good time.

05:45.260 --> 05:47.210
Amy, wait.

05:58.306 --> 06:01.058
Bad hangover?

06:02.894 --> 06:05.896
Last night was a blur.

06:05.898 --> 06:07.898
I know you hate me.

06:07.900 --> 06:12.069
And I don't blame you.
I just want to explain.

06:12.071 --> 06:15.288
Yes, I lied about being a
lesbian, but in my defense,

06:15.290 --> 06:18.659
the only reason that you
noticed me was because I was one.

06:18.661 --> 06:20.544
Why didn't you tell me?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.713
I told you I hate lying,

06:22.715 --> 06:24.915
like, over and over and over.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.583
I was worried that if
you found out the truth

06:26.585 --> 06:28.885
you'd lose interest in me.

06:28.887 --> 06:31.421
So instead, I lied, and...

06:31.423 --> 06:34.057
Now you've lost interest
in me... How ironic.

06:36.761 --> 06:39.563
Okay, um...

06:39.565 --> 06:44.768
Well, don't worry, from now
on, I'll stay out of your life.

06:44.770 --> 06:48.689
Maybe that's for the best.

06:57.783 --> 06:59.700
♪ I've been up all night ♪

07:00.836 --> 07:02.285
Come in.

07:02.287 --> 07:04.087
Did someone here order an
apology with extra cheese?

07:04.089 --> 07:05.505
I don't need the empty calories.

07:05.507 --> 07:07.174
You're only doing this because of Pablo.

07:07.176 --> 07:10.093
He has nothing to do with this.

07:10.095 --> 07:11.461
Okay, maybe he nudged me a little.

07:11.463 --> 07:14.681
But I went too far, and I do feel bad.

07:14.683 --> 07:16.349
And I'm turning over a new leaf.

07:16.351 --> 07:20.137
No more outing people's
secrets. Forgive me?

07:20.139 --> 07:22.105
Nope.

07:22.107 --> 07:25.025
But I could... If you
can do something for me.

07:25.027 --> 07:26.226
Is it a makeover?

07:26.228 --> 07:28.478
Because I have lots of ideas.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.147
Hilarious.

07:30.149 --> 07:32.649
No, keep Tommy from spilling
my secret at school tomorrow

07:32.651 --> 07:35.285
and forever.

07:35.287 --> 07:36.620
Then I will forgive you.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.488
How do you know he hasn't
texted everyone already?

07:38.490 --> 07:41.374
Because I stole his phone and
melted it with my flat iron.

07:43.828 --> 07:46.079
Oh, deal. I got this.

07:46.081 --> 07:48.131
Just need to borrow my mom's car.

07:48.133 --> 07:49.883
But after you forgive me, will you tell me

07:49.885 --> 07:53.136
what those pills are for?

07:53.138 --> 07:56.807
You okay, sugar bear?

07:56.809 --> 07:58.141
You were crying so hard last night,

07:58.143 --> 07:59.476
I never heard what happened.

07:59.478 --> 08:02.229
Why did you two break up?

08:02.231 --> 08:03.930
You should probably sit down.

08:03.932 --> 08:06.733
Oh, dear, breakups between teenage lesbians

08:06.735 --> 08:07.984
can be especially brutal.

08:07.986 --> 08:10.654
We talk about it all the time in PFLAG.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.938
Oh, speaking of, did I tell you?

08:11.940 --> 08:15.742
They elected me president. Such an honor.

08:15.744 --> 08:17.277
Mom, that's great.

08:17.279 --> 08:21.531
So this safe space just got a little safer.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.700
You know, it doesn't even
matter why we broke up.

08:23.702 --> 08:26.036
I just... I want to get her
back, and I can't figure out

08:26.038 --> 08:30.207
how to do that, and even
the Internet's stumped.

08:30.209 --> 08:33.293
I can feel her pulling
away, and it scares me.

08:33.294 --> 08:35.378
Oh, sweetie, why don't you just

08:35.380 --> 08:37.429
show her how much she means to you?

08:37.432 --> 08:38.849
You're an Ashcroft.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.686
We're experts at big,
dramatic gestures of affection.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.636
We are?

08:43.639 --> 08:45.388
Once, after a nasty fight,

08:45.390 --> 08:47.774
your dad drove me out into
the middle of the desert.

08:47.776 --> 08:50.527
Now, at first I was a
little scared, I'll admit,

08:50.529 --> 08:53.446
but he built this huge fire to show me

08:53.448 --> 08:54.898
the passion in his heart.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.199
He did?

08:56.201 --> 08:58.118
Yeah, not only was I deeply touched,

08:58.120 --> 09:00.904
but that's how burning man started.

09:00.906 --> 09:05.075
So what have you got to lose?
Go big or go home, right?

09:06.294 --> 09:07.994
Huh.

09:07.996 --> 09:09.830
I ran into Karma.

09:09.832 --> 09:12.883
I'm guessing from your
broodiness it didn't go well.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.918
We're done.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.586
Finito.

09:16.588 --> 09:18.471
After what happened last
night, there's zero chance

09:18.473 --> 09:20.173
we're ever going to get back together,

09:20.175 --> 09:22.142
and it's all my fault.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.894
Yowzer, here we go again.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.979
Liam, enough with the guilt.
You didn't do anything wrong.

09:25.981 --> 09:28.849
- No, I did.
- No, Karma is the one who lied,

09:28.851 --> 09:31.651
over and over again to get what she wanted.

09:31.653 --> 09:34.271
Even I think that's selfish.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.439
Other than her hair, I
don't get what you and Amy

09:36.441 --> 09:38.775
are so gaga about.

09:38.777 --> 09:41.161
Amy?

09:41.163 --> 09:43.029
Did I say Amy? I meant Jamie.

09:43.031 --> 09:45.031
Buckner, the kid with the stutter?

09:45.033 --> 09:48.251
He thinks Karma is ad-adorable.

09:48.253 --> 09:52.289
You said they were faking being lesbians.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.257
Karma is.

09:54.259 --> 09:57.761
Amy's so tied up in Karma,
she's practically a pretzel.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.963
Apparently she told Karma
she loved her last night,

09:59.965 --> 10:02.766
and Karma rejected her.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.134
She did?

10:04.136 --> 10:06.686
You have to promise me
you won't say anything

10:06.688 --> 10:10.223
about that or about this.

10:13.528 --> 10:14.945
This is what you need help with?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.229
I got him in there,

10:16.231 --> 10:19.482
but there's no way I can get him out.

10:19.484 --> 10:22.319
Be right there, baby.

10:22.321 --> 10:25.288
Oh, where the hell are my sunglasses?

10:25.290 --> 10:28.124
- They're on your head.
- Oh.

10:28.126 --> 10:30.877
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

10:30.879 --> 10:34.080
Can't conquer Cancun without these.

10:34.082 --> 10:38.134
- I can't breathe, Mom. Come here.
- Oh!

10:38.136 --> 10:40.053
Are you going to be okay
home alone for a week?

10:40.055 --> 10:41.805
I won't be alone. Lauren's here.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.307
We're not going to come home
to a crime scene, are we?

10:44.309 --> 10:46.343
That is not the way I
want to get on dateline.

10:46.345 --> 10:48.645
Well, I'm grounded. I have nothing to lose.

10:48.647 --> 10:51.348
Oh, honey, forget about
that. I overreacted.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.266
It's okay. I deserve to be grounded.

10:53.268 --> 10:54.851
For the rest of my life.

10:54.853 --> 10:57.988
It was just a silly dance
between two best friends.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.323
Now, you have fun while we're gone.

11:00.325 --> 11:05.412
Just use protection.

11:05.414 --> 11:08.257
I have a softball bat under my bed.

11:08.259 --> 11:09.709
Oh.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.211
Oh, well, we'll talk when I get back.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.630
Love you! Mwah.

11:28.119 --> 11:30.536
- This is kidnapping.
- It's really more blackmail.

11:30.538 --> 11:32.338
We're going to take
photos of this ass[Bleep]

11:32.340 --> 11:33.756
that are so shocking and deviant,

11:33.758 --> 11:35.341
he'll never tell anyone my secret.

11:35.343 --> 11:36.709
Conveniently, my mom

11:36.711 --> 11:39.845
sells sex toys out of the trunk of her car.

11:39.847 --> 11:43.716
Guys, guys, this is illegal
and highly disturbing.

11:43.718 --> 11:45.468
Lauren, how bad could this secret be?

11:45.470 --> 11:47.219
Ugh, I'm not telling you my [Bleep] secret.

11:47.221 --> 11:48.804
She's not. Trust me, I tried.

11:49.857 --> 11:51.357
Guys, I'm with Amy.

11:51.359 --> 11:52.775
Maybe it's a good thing
this thing gets out.

11:52.777 --> 11:54.643
They say you're only
as sick as your secrets.

11:56.064 --> 11:59.315
What? No, who says that?
Who, the voices in your head?

11:59.317 --> 12:00.399
Tell 'em to shut up.

12:00.401 --> 12:02.034
I changed my mind. I'm on board.

12:02.036 --> 12:03.202
This is America.

12:03.204 --> 12:04.403
We are all entitled to our secrets.

12:04.405 --> 12:06.806
Will you excuse us for a second?

12:11.212 --> 12:12.578
What the hell was that?

12:12.580 --> 12:14.547
"You're only as sick as your secrets"?

12:14.549 --> 12:16.165
I'm sorry, but the guilt is killing me.

12:16.167 --> 12:18.918
Oh, this little piggy went
boo-hoo-hoo all the way home.

12:18.920 --> 12:20.753
Man up.

12:20.755 --> 12:22.722
Look, it's killing me too,
but what would it do to Karma

12:22.724 --> 12:28.260
if she found out that her
soul mate slept with you?

12:28.262 --> 12:30.730
So what, we just pretend it never happened?

12:30.732 --> 12:31.931
What happened?

12:31.933 --> 12:33.482
See how easy that was?

12:33.484 --> 12:37.186
And before we never speak of
this again, do I need to add

12:37.188 --> 12:40.072
contracting syphilis to last
night's list of tragic events?

12:40.074 --> 12:42.608
- No, I'm clean.
- Do you have any documentation?

12:42.610 --> 12:43.776
The only girl I've had sex with

12:43.778 --> 12:47.113
since I last got tested was Karma.

12:47.115 --> 12:49.865
- And now...
- Yeah, okay.

12:49.867 --> 12:52.451
Well, you're Liam Booker,
Hester's own Hugh Hefner.

12:52.453 --> 12:54.086
- Karma changed all of that.
- Oh, really?

12:54.088 --> 12:55.755
If that's the case, then
why did you sleep with me?

12:55.757 --> 12:58.507
Because I was hurt and
angry and way too drunk.

12:58.509 --> 13:00.159
What was your excuse?

13:03.296 --> 13:05.765
Same.

13:05.767 --> 13:07.266
There's someone lurking in the yard

13:07.268 --> 13:08.467
right below your window.

13:08.469 --> 13:10.052
Should I go unlock my gun?

13:10.054 --> 13:11.720

14:20.006 --> 14:21.790
I was just washing my sheets.

14:21.792 --> 14:26.345
For no particular reason.
It's just been a few weeks.

I need to grab our tickets
before we miss our flight.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.936
And I can't have Bruce
thinking I'm a dumb blonde

15:39.823 --> 15:41.022

15:41.024 --> 15:43.241
I have a guy bound and
gagged in the garage,

15:43.243 --> 15:44.909
and you have no further questions?

15:44.911 --> 15:46.211
I trust you.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.663
Just make sure you've
agreed on a safe word,

15:48.665 --> 15:52.000
something short and specific, like taco.

15:52.002 --> 15:54.369
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.904
And make sure no one sees him leave.

15:56.906 --> 16:00.291
To some people, two guys in
one day might seem a bit...

16:00.293 --> 16:02.927
- trashy.
- Hold it right there.

16:02.929 --> 16:05.046
You saw him leave my room this morning?

16:05.048 --> 16:08.716
Don't worry. It'll be our little secret.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.686
Oh, I've always dreamed
of us sharing secrets.

16:11.688 --> 16:16.808
They weren't quite like
this, but I can roll with it.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.894
So I can have an S&M dungeon in our garage,

16:19.896 --> 16:20.779
but I can't fall in love

16:20.781 --> 16:22.313
with my best friend because she's female?

16:22.315 --> 16:23.798
We don't need to rehash all that.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.783
You're done with that phase.

16:24.785 --> 16:26.568
It wasn't a phase, Mother.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.369
But that boy in the garage...

16:28.371 --> 16:30.321
That's a whole other story,
and it's not what it looks like.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.374
And that boy this morning?

16:33.376 --> 16:36.244
- That was what it looked like.
- See?

16:36.246 --> 16:38.413
You slept with a boy.
That means you're straight.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.415
No, it means I'm confused.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.467
That makes two of us.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.919
If you could be with a
boy, why wouldn't you?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.005
It'd be so much easier.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.808
For me or for you?

16:51.510 --> 16:53.895
Let's focus on the positive here.

16:53.897 --> 16:55.763
You're not sure you're lesbian,

16:55.765 --> 16:58.099
and I'm late for my flight to the Yucatan.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.268
Andale, andale.

17:01.770 --> 17:05.573
What do we do now?

17:46.700 --> 17:50.285

because you were a lesbian.

17:50.287 --> 17:52.403
But then...

17:52.405 --> 17:57.375
Then I saw so much more.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.377
I may have lied about being gay,

17:59.379 --> 18:04.298
but I never lied about my feelings for you.

rotting Thai food back there.

18:18.848 --> 18:22.734
Okay, now who wants to help
me arrange these dildos?

18:22.736 --> 18:25.353
Now we're talking. Let's
go bigger to smaller.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.272
It's more shocking.

18:34.521 --> 18:35.937
Just dropped Tommy off.

18:35.939 --> 18:38.056

you have blackmail on me.

18:52.373 --> 18:54.239
I told you, no more outing people.

18:54.241 --> 18:57.492
You say that now, but someday
you'll want to humiliate me.

18:57.494 --> 19:00.629
And I will, but not about this,

there's anything humiliating
