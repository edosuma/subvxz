00:47.521 --> 00:51.691
I’m sorry. Auction rules say cash only. Okay?

00:53.830 --> 01:00.487
Here’s the thing. I’m kind of coming out of a dark place right now and I could really use the distraction.

01:00.632 --> 01:03.662
I need this boy and I need him tonight.

01:03.759 --> 01:09.817
I understand. But by rule, I have to give him to the next highest bidder if she has the money to give.

01:12.142 --> 01:14.779

Okay that did not just happen because I had an entire evening planed,

01:25.033 --> 01:27.201
so what am I supposed to do now?

01:27.261 --> 01:33.087
Well, there are four boys still up for auction, and a cash machine right down the street.

01:35.914 --> 01:36.810
Okay.

01:39.738 --> 01:40.804
See anything you like?

01:40.927 --> 01:42.662
I’m seeing everything I like.

01:42.728 --> 01:43.506
Really?

01:43.732 --> 01:44.961

Actually, I think I’m going to bid on Lucas.

01:54.618 --> 01:55.197

06:17.655 --> 06:20.139
- To keep him away from them.
- Going twice.

06:20.303 --> 06:21.658
Please, Peyton, please.

06:22.041 --> 06:24.188

06:24.369 --> 06:26.872

06:27.957 --> 06:30.804

06:32.453 --> 06:33.563
Going twice.

Oh! $112.53.

06:45.048 --> 06:47.317
- Thank you.
- Wait, wait.

06:47.786 --> 06:50.624
I’m sorry, we’re fresh out of flesh.

06:50.921 --> 06:55.312
I want to thank you all for coming this evening supporting this good cause.

06:55.375 --> 07:01.385
Now all these young men belong to the highest bidders till that midnight kiss.

07:01.696 --> 07:04.720
Let’s try to keep things legal this year.

07:04.827 --> 07:06.880
I’ll give $5 for the microphone boy.

07:07.768 --> 07:10.484
- I’ll go 10.

- Oh no, I’ve got $200.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.338
Sold!

07:18.135 --> 07:19.957
All sales are final.

07:27.923 --> 07:29.669
I didn’t see you in detention.

07:29.993 --> 07:31.338
Can I get you something to eat?

07:31.390 --> 07:33.698
Actually I was wondering if I could get you something to eat.

07:34.273 --> 07:35.880
Unless you’ve got plans after work.

07:36.686 --> 07:37.595
No.

07:37.709 --> 07:39.305
Great. We could go to my place.

07:42.203 --> 07:44.886
Karen. I’m not a serial killer.

07:45.485 --> 07:48.409
It’s just a couple of new friends eating food.

07:50.171 --> 07:51.221
Sure. Okay.

07:51.623 --> 07:53.851
Good, then it’s a date.

07:57.123 --> 08:00.768
Okay, I’ve got $50 cash on the Mouth-Boy for trade. Who wants him?

08:01.540 --> 08:06.098
Well, Timmy. Looks like you’re all mine tonight.

08:06.738 --> 08:10.143
How about you grab a change of clothes and I’ll meet you at the house.

08:10.759 --> 08:12.027
Change of clothes?

08:12.154 --> 08:15.407
Well you’ll probably want to take a shower after I get through with you.

08:15.499 --> 08:17.983
I plan on getting dirty.

08:18.851 --> 08:22.312
So I’ll leave the door unlocked. Just come in and get me.

08:32.732 --> 08:34.173
Well, well, Jake.

08:35.856 --> 08:39.424
Once again, looks like I own you.

08:41.125 --> 08:42.772
Come on, Jake, wait up.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.601
I’m not kidding, Nikki. I’m not falling for your crap.

08:44.667 --> 08:46.117
At least talk to me?

08:47.581 --> 08:51.150
About what? Where you’ve been for the last 8 months or how my daughter doesn’t have a mother?

08:51.206 --> 08:54.866
I understand you’re upset, but there are things you don’t know. Please.

08:54.912 --> 08:58.118
Jake, come on. I don’t want to mess with your head.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.729
But, the least you could do is hear me out.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.576
After that you can ditch me if you want.

09:05.532 --> 09:06.765
What, like you did me?

09:08.378 --> 09:11.498
This things is awesome. Where are we going first?

09:12.198 --> 09:14.806
- Here’s the thing, Lips.
- Mouth.

09:14.877 --> 09:19.699
I know. And I know I owe you for the whole cheerleading competition,

09:19.765 --> 09:24.158
but I had this whole night kind of perfectly planned out and

09:25.085 --> 09:27.221
it’s a waste of a Brazilian wax.

09:28.623 --> 09:31.444
Okay. That’s cool. I can take off.

09:33.457 --> 09:35.175
At least let me give you some of your money back.

09:35.249 --> 09:37.461
Oh, no, no, no. I don’t want that. Please.

09:37.517 --> 09:41.485
No, no I understand. I just thought the car was cool.

09:42.729 --> 09:45.309
Um, I’ll see you later.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.143
Wait. Fine!

09:50.799 --> 09:52.319
I’ll take you to once place.

09:52.442 --> 09:53.201
Really?

09:53.500 --> 09:56.143
What the hell. It’s for charity, right?

09:56.901 --> 09:59.682
With the night I have planned I might need you to carry me home anyway.

09:59.748 --> 10:00.506
Sweet.

10:09.612 --> 10:13.092
I am so excited to have Lucas all to myself for an evening.

10:13.151 --> 10:15.399
We have not had a night to just hang out in forever.

10:15.618 --> 10:17.258
Yeah, same goes for me and Nathan.

10:18.253 --> 10:21.068
I know you’re still into me, but $112?

10:22.778 --> 10:23.774
- Hey you.
- Hey.

10:23.817 --> 10:26.075
- How about you come see me around midnight?
- Sounds good.

10:28.078 --> 10:28.922
Don’t have fun.

10:30.065 --> 10:31.053
I wont.

10:33.264 --> 10:35.532
Alright, come on. Let’s get this over with.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.338
Funny. That’s what he’d say before we used to have sex.

10:52.531 --> 10:54.363
So you’re planning to kill me?

10:55.019 --> 10:56.431
The painters must have left it.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.058
So what do you think of the new place?

10:59.363 --> 11:00.732
You really moved out, huh?

11:00.958 --> 11:03.585
Yeah. Judge declared me emancipated.

11:04.542 --> 11:05.704
Good for you, Nate.

11:06.682 --> 11:07.834
Come on. Check it out.

11:11.833 --> 11:14.746
So what, you got your big cool apartment but you don’t believe in furniture?

11:15.203 --> 11:16.078
Where are we supposed to eat?

11:16.631 --> 11:17.439
We got the bed.

11:29.446 --> 11:32.099
Still doing that whole desert before the meal thing, huh?

11:32.719 --> 11:34.433
You used to think it was cute.

11:38.159 --> 11:41.074
Yeah. That was before you abandoned my child.

11:43.747 --> 11:46.476
Okay. I guess we’ll do this now.

11:50.755 --> 11:54.900
I made a mistake. I didn’t know what kind of mother I’d be.

11:54.957 --> 11:59.626
All my friends were going off to college, my parents… well you know how they felt.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.896
I just wasn’t ready, Jake. Is it that hard to understand?

12:04.141 --> 12:06.245
Yeah, Nikki, it is.

12:07.193 --> 12:10.343
She was a part of you. You held her in your arms.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.633
I spent every night asking myself how you could just leave her behind.

12:14.807 --> 12:18.903
I couldn’t. I hated myself for leaving, that’s why I came back.

12:21.003 --> 12:23.168
I want to be in her life, Jake.

12:24.274 --> 12:25.604
And yours too.

12:36.406 --> 12:38.052
I missed you, you know?

12:39.608 --> 12:42.430
I wanted to call you a thousand times over the last 8 months.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.721
Yeah but you didn’t. Did you?

12:51.627 --> 12:54.478
Well, that was a great dinner, Larry.

12:54.595 --> 12:56.904
Thanks. Single parent cooking class.

12:59.808 --> 13:01.389
I’m glad you decided to come.

13:02.116 --> 13:04.200
- Not too painful?
- No, not at all.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.054
But you don’t date much?

13:07.732 --> 13:09.633
I don’t date at all, really.

13:10.605 --> 13:14.194
At night I work or I’m at home with Lucas.

13:15.740 --> 13:17.102
Sometimes with Keith.

13:19.627 --> 13:21.133
Keith seems like a good man.

13:21.767 --> 13:22.525
He is.

13:25.099 --> 13:26.698
He’s a good friend.

13:33.078 --> 13:36.165
- Well…
- Oh no. Absolutely not.

13:36.354 --> 13:39.836
You’re off duty and not allowed to touch anything but your wine glass.

13:40.409 --> 13:45.191
Tour the house, make a long distance phone call, whatever, it’s called relaxing.

13:45.472 --> 13:47.910
Well you know I do have some friends in Florence.

13:48.576 --> 13:49.917
Maybe I should give them a call.

13:55.792 --> 13:57.670
Haley, now this was a great idea.

13:58.330 --> 13:59.133
I know.

14:00.557 --> 14:02.492
Did you fill any with milk like we used to?

14:02.819 --> 14:04.805
Yeah I did. Some of them.

14:05.543 --> 14:11.180
I can’t do this stuff with Nathan. It just seems, I don’t know, does it seem childish?

14:11.309 --> 14:13.868
- Well, yeah.
- Great!

14:13.930 --> 14:14.815
But in a good way.

14:17.954 --> 14:21.108
So, what’s your situation now?

14:21.349 --> 14:22.188
What do you mean?

14:22.378 --> 14:26.792
With Peyton? Or Brooke. Or bar-slut that I heard about.

14:26.904 --> 14:30.570
Okay. What’d you hear and who’d you hear it from?

14:30.663 --> 14:32.762
Just stuff… from people.

14:33.709 --> 14:35.951
I just want to play ball again.

14:37.088 --> 14:39.341
You know? Get over this damn drama.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.918
You know it wasn’t long ago I was happy playing hoops with the guys and hanging out with you.

14:44.159 --> 14:47.138
Yes, life was much simpler then, wasn’t it?

14:50.856 --> 14:52.324
I think I’m going to go call Nathan.

14:57.503 --> 15:02.243
Ohhh. You are so dead.

15:02.494 --> 15:04.332
I guess that one was a milk balloon.

15:11.784 --> 15:13.364
I think she likes you.

15:16.615 --> 15:20.133
So thanks for bringing me out tonight. I’ve never been to a real club before.

15:20.859 --> 15:21.975
I’m glad I brought you.

15:22.179 --> 15:22.790
Yeah?

15:23.137 --> 15:27.469
Yeah. I enjoy corrupting America’s youth. It’s kind of one of my hobbies.

15:27.666 --> 15:29.784
So was Lucas one of your test subjects?

15:31.320 --> 15:32.845
Can we not go there tonight?

15:32.923 --> 15:35.436
Okay. Sorry.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.004
That girls practically naked up there.

15:40.817 --> 15:43.064
So you don’t like naked girls?

15:43.352 --> 15:45.436
Well I’ve never actually seen one up close.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.247
But from what I’ve found online I’m thinking they’re okay.

15:51.109 --> 15:51.738
What?

15:53.106 --> 15:54.636
Want to find out for sure?

15:58.825 --> 15:59.859
Let’s do some damage.

16:10.590 --> 16:11.988
Kind of severe, huh?

16:13.442 --> 16:15.342
Kind of familiar, actually.

16:16.867 --> 16:21.358
You know when I was a cheerleader we buried a time capsule midfield of the football stadium.

16:22.593 --> 16:27.216
I bet if you dug it up you’d find a version of the same thing our kinds are going through now.

16:29.402 --> 16:33.037
Well, I got a couple of shovels in the garage.

16:33.861 --> 16:34.896
Want to find out?

16:35.827 --> 16:36.672
Yeah.

16:38.413 --> 16:41.018
- Sweet. You got a pool?
- Yeah. You want to go swimming?

16:41.080 --> 16:43.585
No, you are the boy toy you do what I say tonight.

16:43.656 --> 16:45.289
Oh, just like old times.

16:45.350 --> 16:48.764
Please. You did whatever you wanted and most of the time it was either sucky or mean.

16:49.292 --> 16:50.967
I know. But you let me.

16:51.058 --> 16:54.244
Well maybe I kept thinking you’d change. Live and learn, right?

16:55.427 --> 16:57.962
- Is this thing heated?
- I don’t know, why don’t you check it out?

17:07.083 --> 17:08.826
Oh my god!

17:08.891 --> 17:10.765
- I slipped.
- What?!

17:10.832 --> 17:13.496
I slipped. Hey, at least it’s heated.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.873
Real thing sure beats the internet, huh?

17:49.374 --> 17:51.164
The internet sucks.

18:23.059 --> 18:24.029
Hello?

18:26.083 --> 18:26.973
Deb?

18:30.051 --> 18:31.530
Miss Deborah?

18:32.452 --> 18:34.377
Come on in, Timmy, I’m in the bath.

18:39.261 --> 18:41.084
Ready or not, here I come.

18:51.239 --> 18:52.121
Sorry!

18:52.989 --> 18:53.726
Timmy!

18:57.651 --> 19:01.086
I am so sorry. I don’t know what gave you the impression that...

19:01.152 --> 19:02.964
It’s okay. I’m fine. I'm fine...

19:03.842 --> 19:06.992
- It’s just that you startled me and...
- Where’s my shirt?

19:18.494 --> 19:20.719
The lawyers are gonna love this one.

19:28.866 --> 19:29.607
Luke?

19:31.696 --> 19:35.419
I’m all out of balloons. Can we please call a truce?

19:35.470 --> 19:39.591
- Is it a real truce or a trick truce?
- It’s a real truce, I promise.

19:41.526 --> 19:42.238
Okay.

19:43.605 --> 19:44.566
Okay.

19:47.000 --> 19:47.655
Or not!

19:51.347 --> 19:53.522
No Luke, you’re going to hurt your shoulder.

19:54.128 --> 19:55.586
Oh you are so lucky.

19:57.557 --> 19:58.223
What?

20:00.020 --> 20:02.299
- What’s on your back?
- Nothing.

20:02.732 --> 20:05.502
- Haley, is that a tattoo?
- No. It’s nothing.

20:05.602 --> 20:06.462
Haley.

20:14.941 --> 20:16.260
23.

20:17.940 --> 20:19.026
That’s great, Hales.

20:19.523 --> 20:21.370
You see, that’s why I don’t like the guy.

20:21.448 --> 20:23.223
- Lucas.
- No, that’s just like him!

20:23.327 --> 20:26.056
To get you branded with his jersey number right above your ass?

20:26.118 --> 20:27.602
He doesn’t even know about it.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.234
I just, I just did it.

20:32.486 --> 20:33.363
By yourself?

20:34.494 --> 20:36.481
Yeah, by myself.

20:38.371 --> 20:39.802
Haley, why would you do that?

20:40.955 --> 20:42.332
Because I’m in love with him.

20:56.542 --> 20:58.882
Look, I didn’t mean to freak out on you up there, okay?

20:59.761 --> 21:02.111
But, a tattoo?

21:03.833 --> 21:07.437
You got one. You got one with a girl you’re not even dating anymore.

21:07.773 --> 21:08.584
I know.

21:09.479 --> 21:10.636
How stupid do I look?

21:11.973 --> 21:15.439
You hold me to a higher standard than everybody else, Luke, and it’s not fair.

21:15.777 --> 21:19.925
Look, I know it’s not fair, okay? But that’s because I’ve seen you be better than most people.

21:22.064 --> 21:23.172
Let me see it again.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.528
How long ago did you do it?

21:30.631 --> 21:31.588
A few days ago.

21:32.239 --> 21:35.443
- And Nathan had nothing to do with it?
- No, I told you, Nathan doesn’t know.

21:38.152 --> 21:43.713
Ugh, God, what am I going to do, Luke? I’m so, I hate being away from him,

21:43.774 --> 21:47.153
I think about him constantly. I was in the middle of a history quiz yesterday

21:47.215 --> 21:49.279
and I just totally zoned out on him.

21:50.486 --> 21:53.728
Maybe we’re not going to be together for the rest of our lives,

21:53.927 --> 21:56.713
but right now I’m in love for the first time

21:56.861 --> 21:59.651
and if I look at this tattoo 20 years from now,

21:59.967 --> 22:02.016
and it reminds me of how I feel today,

22:02.877 --> 22:04.935
I think I’ll be okay with that.

22:06.323 --> 22:08.586
Then why didn’t you buy Nathan at the auction?

22:09.875 --> 22:11.243
Why hide out with me?

22:15.171 --> 22:20.403
Because, I wanted to remember for a night the way that things were.

22:22.266 --> 22:25.011
Everything was so much simpler when it was just you and me.

22:25.370 --> 22:28.737
And I’m used to being self-confident, and sensible and...

22:30.509 --> 22:33.392
I just really feel like a mess right now.

22:33.997 --> 22:35.211
You’re not a mess.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.128
You’re just in love.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.365
And I’m not sure if he is.

22:45.189 --> 22:48.762
What happened to us, Peyton? We used to be good together.

22:48.903 --> 22:51.620
No, we weren’t. We just had sex a lot.

22:52.045 --> 22:53.073
You sure about that?

22:53.192 --> 22:56.376
Trust me. You’re the only guy I’ve been with.

22:58.096 --> 22:59.064
You knew that.

23:00.021 --> 23:04.307
Yeah, I know, I just, I figured since we broke up, maybe...

23:04.379 --> 23:05.095
No.

23:06.846 --> 23:09.079
Yeah, me neither.

23:12.709 --> 23:14.282
It’s just sex, right?

23:17.066 --> 23:20.666
Okay, you know what, Nathan? Haley really deserves better than that.

23:21.018 --> 23:25.996
She really, really likes you and she’s good for you and more than that, she trusts you...

23:26.062 --> 23:27.783
- I know that.
- And okay, fine.

23:27.844 --> 23:30.409
We could do it, right here in the pool, and nobody would know.

23:30.455 --> 23:31.550
- Peyton…
- But I would know,

23:31.637 --> 23:35.396
and you would know, but I wouldn’t do that to Haley. Or myself.

23:35.668 --> 23:37.427
Or even you for that matter. Cause you know what?

23:37.469 --> 23:41.883
If you screw things up with your relationship with her, than you’re a bigger jackass than even I thought.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.172
I know it would hurt Haley.

23:44.786 --> 23:49.333
The only reason I mentioned it, was to let you know that I’m not pressuring her.

23:50.223 --> 23:52.435
Right. I knew that.

23:56.112 --> 23:58.129
- You said I was good in bed.
- No, I didn’t.

23:58.189 --> 24:01.015
- Oh yes you did.
- Oh, God, kill me.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.200
So I left school for good by the way.

24:08.805 --> 24:10.249
Thought I might transfer here.

24:11.804 --> 24:14.150
Will you at least tell me how she’s doing?

24:18.766 --> 24:19.719
Right.

24:22.525 --> 24:25.502
So I guess asking you how you’re doing is out of the question.

24:26.079 --> 24:26.898
You look good.

24:27.656 --> 24:28.767
Give me the keys, Nikki.

24:30.171 --> 24:31.081
Stop it.

24:32.009 --> 24:33.796
Come on. I missed you, Jake.

24:34.685 --> 24:36.248
Remember how good we were?

24:38.172 --> 24:40.691
I know it’s been hard for you, I do.

24:41.804 --> 24:43.226
Let me make it easier.

24:49.319 --> 24:50.604
Come back to me.

24:52.788 --> 24:54.489
We could be a family.

24:55.530 --> 24:56.246
Damn it.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.078
Damn it, Nikki.

25:01.658 --> 25:03.179
You almost had me again.

25:07.702 --> 25:10.286
You want to impress me with your Maternal instincts?

25:11.325 --> 25:12.031
Get out.

25:21.500 --> 25:25.021
Why don’t you go buy all the things you think Jenny might need. I’ll wait.

25:25.108 --> 25:25.968
Okay.

25:26.080 --> 25:30.713
Hey, by the way. She’s 9 months old, just incase you forgot.

25:31.319 --> 25:32.701
I’ll be fine.

25:36.340 --> 25:36.847
Hey.

25:36.915 --> 25:38.301
Hey, Keith, come on in.

25:38.722 --> 25:41.836
I saw your car. So how did pimp duty go?

25:41.897 --> 25:44.109
That’s charity coordinator.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.923
Right. Assuming you’d raffle yourself off, huh?

25:47.088 --> 25:48.578
Nobody could afford me.

25:52.239 --> 25:53.960
I’m glad you came by, Keith.

25:55.491 --> 25:57.196
I’ve been wanting to ask you a question.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.337
When do you plan to start living?

26:05.454 --> 26:08.106
Well, I am living, coach.

26:08.435 --> 26:11.075
No you’re not. You’re dying.

26:11.619 --> 26:14.291
I for one think it’s a damn shame.

26:18.234 --> 26:20.764
You know what I’d change in my life if I could?

26:21.358 --> 26:23.041
I’d have Camilla back.

26:24.839 --> 26:27.383
Just to spend one more day with her.

26:28.270 --> 26:30.359
When we were young and in love.

26:32.879 --> 26:34.475
You love Karen, don’t you?

26:36.600 --> 26:37.854
Yeah, I do.

26:39.216 --> 26:41.556
And I plan on telling her that it’s just...

26:42.580 --> 26:44.971
things have been kind of messy since the accident, you know?

26:45.483 --> 26:46.504
I understand.

26:49.097 --> 26:51.142
There’s something you need to understand.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.374
Everyday you wait,

26:55.321 --> 26:58.152
is another day you’ll never get back again.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.456
Trust me on that, son.

27:02.345 --> 27:03.215
I know.

27:07.571 --> 27:11.997
So why don’t you have a girlfriend? You’re a nice guy.

27:12.668 --> 27:14.649
Well that’s the problem. I’m too nice.

27:15.402 --> 27:18.714
- Girls like jerks.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

27:19.102 --> 27:19.963
You mean Lucas?

27:20.916 --> 27:22.892
I thought we weren’t going to talk about Lucas tonight,

27:22.938 --> 27:25.386
but I could just throw your ass out at the next light.

27:25.924 --> 27:29.553
Okay. So let me ask you a question.

27:30.884 --> 27:32.057
What do girls want?

27:32.590 --> 27:34.104
Half your paycheck.

27:40.304 --> 27:42.589
Here’s my philosophy on dating.

27:44.211 --> 27:47.949
It’s important to have somebody that can make you laugh.

27:48.457 --> 27:53.378
Somebody you can trust. Somebody that, you know, turns you on.

27:54.094 --> 28:00.453
And it’s really, really important that these three people don’t know each other.

28:05.675 --> 28:07.846
I got the cutest little stuffed animal.

28:11.397 --> 28:16.074
She has a purple monkey that she can’t sleep without. Anything else she ignores.

28:18.363 --> 28:22.617
You got the wrong formula. She needs a special kind because, well she wasn’t breastfeed.

28:23.628 --> 28:26.039
The alcohol in these wipes are bad for her skin.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.564
I buy her a special vitamin because she was a little underweight at her six month checkup.

28:31.399 --> 28:35.040
She doesn’t read. She sure as hell doesn’t smoke.

28:35.427 --> 28:38.194
Oh well look, at least you got the most expensive kind of ice cream.

28:38.255 --> 28:39.515
I got that for you.

28:40.559 --> 28:45.158
Cause on our third date you said that all you needed for life to be good was a pint of this ice cream.

28:47.522 --> 28:49.806
I want your life to be good, Jake.

28:51.435 --> 28:54.394
I want to be with the boy that told me those things.

28:56.442 --> 28:58.212
- Where did he go?
- You left him.

28:59.263 --> 29:01.591
Damn it, Nikki, it’s not fair for you to come back here and do this.

29:01.650 --> 29:04.030
It’s not fair to me, and it’s not fair to Jenny.

29:04.545 --> 29:06.324
I still love you, you know?

29:06.645 --> 29:10.839
It’s funny. I can’t tell you how many times I spent wondering

29:10.987 --> 29:13.076
when I was going to hear you say that again.

29:13.430 --> 29:17.484
Just hoping the next time the phone rang it’d be you, calling to say those words.

29:17.545 --> 29:18.047
Jake.

29:18.109 --> 29:23.680
And now that you’re here, I... I cant even remember why I needed to hear them.

29:24.775 --> 29:27.592
You should recognize this next move, Nikki. You perfected it.

29:28.544 --> 29:31.058
It called turning my back and leaving you behind.

29:40.577 --> 29:43.136
I don’t know about this, Larry. We’re trespassing.

29:43.218 --> 29:45.411
No we’re not. Our taxes paid for this place.

29:45.482 --> 29:48.886
Oh, okay, let’s try vandalism, theft…

29:48.953 --> 29:52.614
We loosen dirt, on a field we paid for, get property that belongs to you,

29:52.721 --> 29:55.265
and we put the dirt back. What could they charge for us?

29:56.270 --> 29:57.677
Immaturity.

29:58.015 --> 30:01.026
There’s a difference between growing up and growing old, Karen.

30:03.085 --> 30:04.385
Give me the shovel.

30:10.623 --> 30:14.517
I can’t believe you do this every night. You have the greatest life.

30:26.365 --> 30:27.220
Hi.

30:27.798 --> 30:29.770
You look hot tonight.

30:30.195 --> 30:30.921
Thanks.

30:36.247 --> 30:37.701
So, what’s your name?

30:39.488 --> 30:41.556
You don’t remember the last time we did this.

30:42.313 --> 30:45.585
You were pretty wasted. You’re name is Brooke, right?

30:52.175 --> 30:56.225
So, Brooke. Are we going to do this again, or what?

31:06.748 --> 31:07.499
You okay?

31:08.534 --> 31:09.669
I need to go home.

31:21.502 --> 31:23.264
Brooke, did something happen?

31:27.694 --> 31:29.040
Do you want to talk about it?

31:33.182 --> 31:35.205
How long have you known Lucas?

31:35.455 --> 31:37.635
Since 4th grade. I transferred in.

31:38.691 --> 31:40.252
And you think he’s a good guy?

31:41.504 --> 31:43.216
I think he’s a great guy.

31:43.944 --> 31:44.702
Why?

31:48.854 --> 31:51.044
Remember when I told you what girls want?

31:53.846 --> 31:56.330
Girls just want somebody to want them back.

31:58.201 --> 31:59.509
At least I do.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.085
If it’s action that you’re craving, go and get yourself a Raven.

32:11.136 --> 32:14.137
We said go. Ravens. Go mighty Ravens.

32:14.188 --> 32:20.374
If you really want to score, gotta dig a little more. We say go, Ravens, go mighty Ravens.

32:20.424 --> 32:21.837
Oh. We got treasure.

32:25.565 --> 32:27.705
Oh yeah.

32:30.357 --> 32:31.914
- Check it out.
- Oh!

32:42.387 --> 32:45.135
Bon Jovi. I saw that tour. Scorpions opened for them.

32:45.193 --> 32:45.832
Yeah.

32:46.988 --> 32:48.976
Oh no!

32:49.415 --> 32:51.977
- Check out the hair.
- Me and Dan.

32:52.517 --> 32:53.864
Is that Keith?

32:54.604 --> 32:57.516
Yeah. He was always very protective.

32:58.995 --> 33:01.863
You know, I don’t think I ever noticed Keith in the picture before.

33:02.104 --> 33:05.805
Well, the kid in the background is definitely in love with the girl in the foreground.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.398
What in the sam hill is going on here?

33:10.509 --> 33:12.385
Oh my God.

33:13.142 --> 33:15.263
- Karen?
- Hi, Whitey.

33:15.380 --> 33:16.803
Offer you a beer, coach?

33:18.105 --> 33:20.222
We were, um, having dinner and...

33:21.165 --> 33:22.112
Oh hey, Keith.

33:33.115 --> 33:36.848
It’s nearly midnight. Looks like our date’s almost over.

33:37.084 --> 33:37.733
Yeah.

33:40.411 --> 33:42.152
I think I was hitting on you in the pool.

33:42.593 --> 33:43.955
You think you were?

33:44.656 --> 33:50.217
I don’t know anymore. This whole good guy thing, it’s new to me.

33:53.498 --> 33:56.351
I guess I’ll always have feelings for you, Peyton.

33:58.213 --> 34:01.277
But I owe it to Haley to be a better guy than I’ve been.

34:03.339 --> 34:05.648
I just don’t want to be the kind of guy that cheats on her.

34:07.322 --> 34:08.408
Then don’t be.

34:11.388 --> 34:12.934
Nathan, I’m proud of you.

34:14.101 --> 34:18.313
You know, standing up to your dad, and being a good guy for Haley.

34:19.585 --> 34:22.375
You’re turning into the kind of guy I always knew you could be.

34:26.405 --> 34:28.731
- So Nathan got his own place.
- Yeah this is it.

34:28.795 --> 34:31.745
Oh crap. I left some cds for him in the car. I’ll be right back.

34:31.827 --> 34:33.010
- No, I’ll come.
- No, it’s alright.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.514
Um, why don’t you go ahead and go on in, apartment 11.

34:35.610 --> 34:39.036
Hey, ask him if he’s in love with me, and if he says no, break up with him for me, okay?

34:39.108 --> 34:39.851
- Okay.
- Great.

34:39.967 --> 34:45.661
Hey. Seriously. Say something nice, okay? I mean, he’s really a different person.

34:46.481 --> 34:47.612
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:50.607 --> 34:52.956
- I better get going.
- Okay.

34:54.487 --> 34:57.186
I guess by rule, I owe you a kiss.

34:57.739 --> 34:58.743
I guess so.

35:14.513 --> 35:15.844
He wasn’t there.

35:16.274 --> 35:17.724
Are you sure? Apartment 11?

35:17.997 --> 35:18.737
Yeah.

35:20.780 --> 35:23.976
Voice mail. Great. I guess he’s not done yet. I told you Peyton was easy.

35:24.523 --> 35:25.864
Come on, I’ll take you home.

35:26.504 --> 35:27.227
Okay.

35:34.604 --> 35:36.826
I guess I should have told my parents I’d be out late.

35:38.366 --> 35:40.538
I’m not sure this was a good idea.

35:40.907 --> 35:42.585
Mouth, you’ve got to live a little.

35:42.699 --> 35:48.376
No, it’s not that. I mean, a night with you is like flying first class.

35:49.724 --> 35:50.892
My life is coach.

35:51.803 --> 35:53.753
It’s going to be hard going back to it.

35:55.140 --> 36:00.313
Thanks, but this gets old, pretty quick. Trust me.

36:01.572 --> 36:02.683
Listen, Brooke.

36:03.267 --> 36:06.747
I don’t know what’s going on with you and Lucas but he’s a really good guy.

36:07.962 --> 36:11.797
I’ve never been really good at sports, I mean, I’m little, you know.

36:13.230 --> 36:15.672
But when I decided I wanted to be a sports announcer,

36:15.908 --> 36:20.868
Lucas introduced me to the guys at the river court and it made me feel like I belonged.

36:22.631 --> 36:26.507
He has a good heart. And as far as I can tell, you do too.

36:28.119 --> 36:31.043
I’d be really surprised if you two couldn’t work things out.

36:32.209 --> 36:32.968
Thank you.

36:36.726 --> 36:40.652
Well, I should get home. That stripper might booty call me.

36:43.295 --> 36:44.073
Mouth.

36:52.565 --> 36:54.988
Oh right. For the charity thing.

36:55.445 --> 36:56.069
Nah.

36:57.695 --> 36:58.778
Just cause.

37:00.843 --> 37:01.875
Hey, Brooke.

37:03.464 --> 37:06.990
Thanks. This was the greatest night of my life.

37:20.881 --> 37:24.484
Well, did you have fun tonight, slave boy? Thanks for playing along.

37:25.320 --> 37:29.703
Look, Haley. I know we’ve grown apart a bit lately.

37:30.578 --> 37:33.200
And I know we have a lot a head of us, but...

37:34.936 --> 37:37.378
I just want you to know I’ll always be there for you.

37:38.535 --> 37:44.690
And if Nathan doesn’t see how special you really are, well, then he’s an idiot.

37:45.424 --> 37:47.028
Cause I think you’re amazing.

37:48.745 --> 37:49.743
Thanks, Luke.

37:53.659 --> 37:56.864
Oh, technically you owe me a goodnight kiss.

37:59.461 --> 38:03.904
Mm. Rules are rules, I guess.

38:03.952 --> 38:05.522
Yeah, I guess so.

38:08.826 --> 38:10.807
Here’s the thing, though, if your tongue comes anywhere near my mouth

38:10.868 --> 38:12.266
I’m just never speaking to you again.

38:21.502 --> 38:22.526
Hey, Haley.

38:24.749 --> 38:26.066
You’re going to be okay.

38:27.155 --> 38:28.103
I promise you that.

38:48.900 --> 38:50.918
- Nikki, don’t do this.
- Jake, please.

38:51.266 --> 38:53.994
Keeping Jenny away from me because I hurt you is wrong.

39:01.818 --> 39:03.222
Can’t you just forgive me?

39:05.103 --> 39:06.297
It was a Wednesday.

39:07.097 --> 39:09.130
What? What was?

39:09.810 --> 39:12.099
The day I realized that you weren’t coming back.

39:14.102 --> 39:17.735
I loved you. You knew I loved you. I would have done anything for you.

39:18.304 --> 39:22.222
But you betrayed me. So it was that same Wednesday that I stopped loving you.

39:23.179 --> 39:28.125
And I promised myself that my daughter would never feel the pain that you caused me.

39:35.408 --> 39:36.799
You want to hear me say it?

39:37.557 --> 39:39.690
Fine. You broke my heart, Nikki.

39:40.465 --> 39:45.268
But you will never break my daughters heart because you will never, ever have the chance to.

39:47.720 --> 39:50.003
I’m going to be in her life, Jake.

39:50.997 --> 39:53.858
With you or without you.

40:01.179 --> 40:03.812
So would you like some coffee?

40:03.898 --> 40:06.693
It’s getting late, I should probably go.

40:07.253 --> 40:11.430
I had a lot of fun tonight. I didn’t do much of this in high school.

40:11.527 --> 40:14.988
Well, maybe next time we could do something less juvenile.

40:15.116 --> 40:17.118
Oh well, if we have to.

40:21.908 --> 40:27.415
Karen, I know you have some history with Keith. I hope I didn’t cause any problems tonight.

40:28.382 --> 40:29.039
No.

40:29.960 --> 40:33.528
But I like you. For what it’s worth.

40:35.310 --> 40:36.977
Well, I like you too, Larry.

40:38.566 --> 40:42.728
And you’re right. I do have history with Keith.

40:44.470 --> 40:46.169
I’m just not sure we have a future.

40:56.419 --> 40:57.388
Goodnight.

40:58.515 --> 40:59.505
Goodnight.

41:18.210 --> 41:18.852
Keith.

41:19.670 --> 41:21.048
It’s not too late, is it?

41:21.422 --> 41:23.643
No. Is everything okay?

41:23.750 --> 41:27.852
Not really. These last few weeks have been the hardest of my life.

41:29.789 --> 41:34.518
Being without you and Lucas, on the outside of your lives.

41:36.033 --> 41:40.948
I felt... I felt like a shadow of someone I used to be.

41:42.636 --> 41:47.196
And I know I let you down. And I put Lucas at risk,

41:47.518 --> 41:52.716
but you have to know, I love Lucas.

41:53.094 --> 41:59.187
And I’ve been carrying this around with me since the night of the accident.

42:03.605 --> 42:04.900
I love you Karen.

42:05.152 --> 42:06.131
Keith.

42:06.607 --> 42:07.813
I always have.

42:10.215 --> 42:11.090
Marry me.

42:29.936 --> 42:32.066
I need to talk to you.

42:34.069 --> 42:34.761
Okay.

42:36.256 --> 42:42.682
I spent the entire night trying to avoid this or ignore it,

42:42.866 --> 42:45.313
but I cant so I’ve just got to say it.

42:46.914 --> 42:48.072
Brooke what’s up?

42:51.268 --> 42:52.737
I think I’m pregnant.
