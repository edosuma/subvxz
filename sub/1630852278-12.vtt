00:01.001 --> 00:02.502
- Jesus, Ma.
What's going on?

00:05.380 --> 00:06.381
Mr. Becker.

00:09.134 --> 00:12.053
Okay, look, I am so sorry.

00:12.053 --> 00:14.014
I don't
know what to say.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.557
I just--I feel terrible, I'm--

00:17.559 --> 00:19.227
- Thank you.
Thank you.

00:21.646 --> 00:24.566
When you got April stabbed,

00:24.566 --> 00:26.943
they had to cut her open,
deal with her lacerated colon.

00:26.943 --> 00:28.236
- I thought it was just a nick.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.155
- And when they did,

00:30.155 --> 00:32.282
they found a malignant
tumor, stage II.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.992
- What?

00:33.992 --> 00:36.619
- And they never would've found
out until it started spreading

00:36.619 --> 00:37.370
and it was too late.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.958
- So that's...

00:41.958 --> 00:44.252
good news?

00:44.252 --> 00:46.379
- You saved my daughter's life.
- You're a hero, Ed.

00:48.006 --> 00:51.009
Well, I don't know about that.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.553
I'm just a guy who got a girl
stabbed. Anyone would've done
it.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.306
- And you're gonna
get to start trading again.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.100
- Ma, come on. How many
times have we gone over this?

00:59.100 --> 01:01.478
- Hey, you talking
about the lifetime ban?

01:01.478 --> 01:04.731
I got friends on the
Chicago board. Big guys.

01:04.731 --> 01:06.107
And I'm gonna get them
to go to bat for you.

01:06.107 --> 01:08.276
- Isn't that wonderful?

01:08.276 --> 01:10.653
- So I'm gonna go visit my
daughter now. - Yes, Roger.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.739
- So we'll see you two tomorrow
afternoon for the closing.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.449
Yeah?
- Perfect.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.367
- The closing?
- Yeah, the deal's back on.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.619
- It's--it's back on?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.954
- 100%.

01:19.954 --> 01:20.747
- That's it?
It's done?

01:20.747 --> 01:22.624
- Absolutely.

01:22.624 --> 01:23.958
All you have to do
is fire everyone.

01:23.958 --> 01:24.709
- I'll walk you out, Roger.

01:27.796 --> 01:31.508
♪ Now,
now, now, now, now ♪

01:33.009 --> 01:35.261
- Ma.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.222
Ma, when he says "fire
everyone," who was he talking
about?

01:37.222 --> 01:38.306
- Everyone.

01:38.306 --> 01:39.724
- Everyone?

01:39.724 --> 01:41.768
- Well, not everyone. Just
the guys who make the tractors.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.478
- That--that's everyone!

01:43.478 --> 01:45.772
- No, well, they'll still
keep the people in the office,
and Arthur.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.483
- Ma, you promised they wouldn't
come in and lay everyone off.

01:48.483 --> 01:51.444
- I never promised you.
I said it was unlikely.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.571
And I was wrong.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.657
What, you've never
been wrong before?

01:55.657 --> 01:57.700
- This--this is not okay.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.161
These are--these are good
people. They need these jobs.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.539
- Roger's not gonna pay for
your friends, Frick and Frack,

02:02.539 --> 02:04.833
to build tractors when there's
not any tractors to build.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.544
- Then why the fuck
is he buying a tractor business

02:07.544 --> 02:09.212
if he's not gonna
build tractors?

02:09.212 --> 02:11.798
- He's gonna import the parts
and sell them at a discount.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.050
That's what he does.
He's in the parts business.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.136
We sell wholes.
Or at least we did.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.720
- No, there's gotta be something
we can do.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.140
- Ed, let it go, okay?
It's happening.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.771
- Some of these people have been
with the company for decades.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.107
How are you gonna tell 'em?

02:29.107 --> 02:30.775
- I'm not.
Arthur is.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.861
- Arthur?

02:32.861 --> 02:34.946
- He's set up a meeting with the
workers at the end of the day.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.531
He's a good hatchet man.

02:36.531 --> 02:40.326
- Well, he's a terrible hatchet
man. He's a dickless fuck.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.744
- Who else is gonna do it?

02:49.252 --> 02:51.212
- You sure about this, Ed?

02:51.212 --> 02:54.257
I don't mind doing it.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.176
- Nah, if this has to happen,
I should be the one to do it.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.178
- Great.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.430
You know, I think--I
think that's smart.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.640
It's tough stuff, this--
this firing business.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.143
- All right, shut the fuck up,
Arthur. I just need one thing,
okay?

03:05.143 --> 03:07.520
I need all of the financials.
Everything you got.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.773
- Yeah, sure.
Um...

03:10.773 --> 03:13.735
why do you need the books?

03:13.735 --> 03:15.695
- Look, if I'm gonna tell all
these people they're getting
fired,

03:15.695 --> 03:17.197
I at least wanna be
able to explain why.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.949
- Hey, hey, hey.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.201
- Monthly reports, Arthur.

03:21.201 --> 03:21.910
- Thank you.

03:28.666 --> 03:32.003
- Hey, Joe.
Joe.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.842
I--I don't know what you heard.

03:37.842 --> 03:41.346
- I got the gist.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.598
- There's--there's just
some shit going down.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.725
- Shit going down.
Yeah.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.101
I got fucking kids, man.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.979
- I know.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.314
Look, I'm sorry.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.128
- Uh--

04:14.128 --> 04:17.465
Thank you--thank you all for--
for being here on such short
notice.

04:22.428 --> 04:26.808
Um, Poole Tractors has been
in my family for 64 years.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.768
- Nobody gives a fuck!

04:28.768 --> 04:32.021
- Are you firing all of us? What
the fuck is wrong with you
people?

04:32.021 --> 04:33.273
- Y-yes.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.358
I mean, I was--I
was sent down here

04:35.358 --> 04:38.194
to inform you...

04:38.194 --> 04:40.613
that my family is
selling Poole Tractors.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.200
And unfortunately,

04:44.200 --> 04:46.494
we won't be needing your
services any longer.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.996
- You suck!

04:49.706 --> 04:51.416
-- Okay,
- Just
'cause you got a small dick.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.042
- I gotta get this out--

04:53.042 --> 04:55.712
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Let the man finish.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.469
- Look, it doesn't
take a genius to know

05:03.469 --> 05:06.848
that it's not the best time
to be in the tractor business.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.725
- With all due respect, Captain,

05:08.725 --> 05:10.852
for us, now's not a great time
to get out of the tractor
business.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.398
- No, I know, I--

05:15.398 --> 05:17.984
listen, I was poring
through the books,

05:17.984 --> 05:19.944
and the numbers don't lie, okay?

05:19.944 --> 05:22.155
We're not doing well.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.908
Costs are up 31.43%
over the last two years,

05:25.908 --> 05:31.080
yet productivity is down 21.44%.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.249
And I don't wanna
overwhelm you with numbers,

05:33.249 --> 05:35.918
but that doesn't check out.

05:35.918 --> 05:39.047
And my theory is that
productivity is down

05:39.047 --> 05:40.840
because we're not
paying you enough.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.091
Yeah.
You got that right!

05:42.091 --> 05:43.509
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.555
- Which is why

05:47.555 --> 05:51.684
I would like to offer a
14.68% raise across the board,

05:51.684 --> 05:54.771
for everyone.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.357
And I wanna lock that
in for five years.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.276
Yeah, that'd be great.

06:00.276 --> 06:03.404
- Uh, what's the catch?

06:03.404 --> 06:05.907
- There is no catch, okay?

06:05.907 --> 06:09.911
The only thing I would ask is
for those of you who can manage

06:09.911 --> 06:13.039
to quit your part-time jobs.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.417
Okay? Just take that
energy and bring it here.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.419
Okay?
We'll take care of you.

06:18.419 --> 06:21.089
I'm happy to pay you more.
Okay?

06:21.089 --> 06:24.926
I truly believe that-- that if
we work our fucking asses off,

06:24.926 --> 06:27.387
we can turn this around.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.723
And in addition, I'll create
a bonus structure tied to profit

06:30.723 --> 06:33.393
so when we win, you guys win.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.478
Hell yeah!

06:40.483 --> 06:44.195
- All right.
Gimme some of that.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.071
- Thank you.
Thank you, man.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.781
Hey, hey.
Come on.

06:46.781 --> 06:47.698
All right, man.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.870
It's a good plan.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.914
- Before you get into
the merits of it, Edward,

06:54.914 --> 06:57.291
I'd like to know why you made
that absurd offer last night

06:57.291 --> 06:59.460
before consulting me first.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.796
- Because I knew you'd hold it
up and we don't have time for
that.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.882
Ma, if we're gonna save the
company, we have to do it now.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.717
You have to trust me.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.220
It's gonna work. It's in
everyone's best interest.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.639
- And you're gonna
have to trust me.

07:11.639 --> 07:15.101
What I'm doing here
is in your best interest.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.772
- What is this?
Ma.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.232
Ma, what's--what's happening?

07:21.232 --> 07:22.942
- Everything's gonna be okay,
Edward. - Whoa--hey!

07:22.942 --> 07:24.152
- We're just getting
you a little help.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.237
- Help?
I don't need help!

07:26.237 --> 07:28.823
Arthur, this is--Arthur, tell
her she has no right to do this!

07:28.823 --> 07:30.575
- True, she doesn't,
but Dr. Flaherty does,

07:30.575 --> 07:32.660
and he signed off on
a 72-hour psych hold.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.620
- Are you fucking kidding me?
This is crazy!
