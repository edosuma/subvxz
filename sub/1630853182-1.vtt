00:20.000 --> 00:24.079
But I stayed! I haven't left! I am all..

00:24.080 --> 00:25.760
...yours! You absolutely cannot

00:25.790 --> 00:31.760
compare me with them. It is irrational! It has been...

00:32.000 --> 00:33.180
ages since

00:33.200 --> 00:35.400
the servants left. While I am.. I am...

00:35.500 --> 00:40.300
right here! My intellect, my knowledge, my talent are at your feet! Look..

00:40.910 --> 00:41.760

00:41.790 --> 00:42.790

00:48.540 --> 00:50.078

unexcelled running

00:51.580 --> 00:56.198
smoothness. Quick start and smooth stop.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.220
At your service! No problems!

00:58.240 --> 01:02.190
And fires? They have stopped in the castle forever

01:02.191 --> 01:03.618
since I created

01:03.620 --> 01:07.000
this Versatile Fire Safety System!

01:07.100 --> 01:10.180
Why do you need those servants? I-
OOOPS, stop it!
-am the most...

01:10.200 --> 01:15.930
loyal of all your servants!
I don't even want to hear about those runaways! Don't ruin my appetite!

01:15.950 --> 01:24.220
They... will get their just deserves. All of them!

02:55.620 --> 02:56.620
A-a-a-h....

02:57.790 --> 02:58.990
Meow! Meow!

03:00.540 --> 03:01.850
Your Majesty, we must-

03:01.870 --> 03:02.870
leave!

03:02.990 --> 03:04.510
Quickly! Hurry up, Your Majesty!

03:04.540 --> 03:05.540
Hurry up!

03:05.830 --> 03:11.578
Leave me be! More! More!
You will burn!

03:11.580 --> 03:12.580
Completely!

03:12.790 --> 03:13.790
*breathes*

03:14.250 --> 03:16.470
Where is the flintstone? *heavy breath, sounds*

03:16.500 --> 03:18.950
OOOPS, do you have the flintstone?!

03:21.080 --> 03:22.440
THE FLINTSTONE!

03:36.040 --> 03:39.868
Here she is! *laughter*

03:39.870 --> 03:40.870
Wow!

03:41.100 --> 03:42.760
*laughter* Well.. ah.. Ouch!

03:42.790 --> 03:45.248
Hey! What are you.. ? Stop it!
I want it too!

03:45.250 --> 03:46.010
He-e-e-y! Stop it, stop!

03:46.040 --> 03:48.010
What is wrong with you? You get down too!

03:48.040 --> 03:49.930
Right now! Stop fooling aroung there!

03:49.950 --> 03:52.950
Ah! A fire!

03:54.500 --> 03:55.470
Quickly! Follow me!

03:55.500 --> 03:56.470
*sound*

03:56.500 --> 03:58.560
Let's run to the castle! Hurry!

03:59.660 --> 04:01.640
Hurry up!

04:07.870 --> 04:09.150
Nice flame! Yes..

04:09.370 --> 04:12.470
... the flame is nice! Maybe somebody is alive in there?
It is time to put it out. There is nobody there!

04:12.500 --> 04:14.000
The Queen has been living alone for ages.

04:14.100 --> 04:16.510
Who would ever want to live with someone like her? Remember...

04:16.540 --> 04:21.118
something happened to her. She became greedy, cruel.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.600
She turned into a nasty shrew! All her servants left her!

04:23.620 --> 04:25.850
Not all! They say someone stayed with her.
She is alone!

04:25.870 --> 04:27.088
Who would ever want to be with someone like her?

04:27.090 --> 04:30.470
No, she's got somebody! His name is-
Who cares about-

04:30.500 --> 04:31.500
Look!

04:31.580 --> 04:34.825
Meow! Meow! Meow!

04:34.830 --> 04:35.600
A kitten! Up there!

04:35.620 --> 04:37.470
Oh dear! It is done for!

04:37.500 --> 04:38.860
Meow! Meow! Meow!

04:40.080 --> 04:41.760
Stop! Ouch!

04:42.040 --> 04:44.260
Hey! Where are you going?!

04:46.250 --> 04:48.000
You will burn to death!

04:55.100 --> 04:56.930
We need the firemen!
Where are-

04:56.950 --> 04:58.070
our rescuers?

04:58.071 --> 05:00.270
Firemen! What a-

05:00.410 --> 05:01.140
tragedy!

05:01.160 --> 05:02.280
We don't need

05:02.290 --> 05:03.890
a tragedy! Come on!

05:03.910 --> 05:09.720
The ladder! On the watch! The pump! The hoses!

05:09.750 --> 05:10.750
Meow! Meow!

05:11.540 --> 05:14.140
Come on, Ginger! Hold on! Hold on!

05:14.160 --> 05:15.160
Hold on!

05:15.200 --> 05:16.480
She did save it.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.470
*sounds* Wait!

05:18.500 --> 05:20.788
Let me go! Let me go!

05:20.790 --> 05:22.350
I order you!
It is going to-

05:22.370 --> 05:23.970
EXPLODE! YOU WILL GO UP IN FLAMES, YOUR...

05:23.990 --> 05:25.350
Majesty!
There-

05:25.370 --> 05:27.510
IS MY FLINTSTONE!

05:38.990 --> 05:41.100
That's it! I am done for!

05:41.110 --> 05:44.070
No, Your Majesty - you are alive!

05:44.290 --> 05:46.220
I am doomed...

05:48.000 --> 05:50.350
What a brave girl! Atta girl!

05:50.370 --> 05:54.850
Brave and stupid - she could have burnt to death!
She could have, nevertheless...

05:54.870 --> 05:56.310
she saved a life!

05:56.330 --> 05:58.010
I was scared to death!

05:58.620 --> 05:59.620
Ah!

05:59.870 --> 06:02.350
Do you realize you could have died because of this-

06:02.370 --> 06:04.770
kitten?
But it is alive!

06:05.000 --> 06:06.180
Alive indeed! And-

06:06.200 --> 06:08.740
I need you alive and well!
Hah!

06:09.410 --> 06:11.100
Your granddaughter is a hero!

06:11.120 --> 06:13.310
When you get older - I'll take you on a team of...

06:13.330 --> 06:14.330
rescuers!

06:14.580 --> 06:17.760
Get the ladder to the castle! Pump it, pump it!
A rescuer?

06:17.790 --> 06:19.310
She must stay home!

06:19.370 --> 06:21.700
Home? What the... home!

06:22.410 --> 06:23.450
The gal is like a fire!

06:25.160 --> 06:27.520
Not fire - Ginger!

06:31.990 --> 06:33.260
*LAUGHTER* Ginger...

06:33.290 --> 06:34.730
Look, here comes -

06:34.910 --> 06:36.590
your fill-belly again!

06:37.080 --> 06:39.810
Because we make a perfect

06:40.290 --> 06:41.290
couple!

06:41.500 --> 06:43.180
Look, he is a picture-

06:44.330 --> 06:45.100
of a cat!

06:45.120 --> 06:47.538
*shrieck* Ooh!

06:47.540 --> 06:48.540
*laughter*

06:48.660 --> 06:50.140
Well, Potter, looks like..

06:50.160 --> 06:51.360
you're destined to carry her in your arms

06:51.870 --> 06:53.470
forever. Ahem-

06:56.500 --> 06:58.170
Guys!

06:58.620 --> 07:00.680
What are you building? What is this house?

07:00.700 --> 07:03.570
It isn't a house - it's a shop! FROM-HEAD-

07:04.160 --> 07:05.160
TO-TOE!

07:05.540 --> 07:08.100

Wait, don't run away! It’s so cold outside…

08:31.141 --> 08:33.450
You need a top hat for your head-

08:33.451 --> 08:35.700

And a chamber pot! *laughter*

09:13.001 --> 09:15.600
Right you are! His pots always give me-

09:16.100 --> 09:18.400
You... Are? Ahh!

09:19.000 --> 09:21.400
Potter! Don’t take it seriously!

09:23.100 --> 09:27.000
Well done – mocking somebody who is doing his best for you!

09:27.100 --> 09:31.100
He is a craftsman like we all are! Hurt Potter’s feelings for no reason! Potter will show his worth!

09:31.500 --> 09:35.600
He has already shown himself! He promised to finish the fountain - and never finished it!

09:35.601 --> 09:38.300
Why promise then? Why would anyone want to finish the fountain?

09:38.301 --> 09:41.700
He is doing it for everyone! So that? It looks nice!

09:41.701 --> 09:45.500
How does he know what "nice" is? Judging by his pots?

09:45.501 --> 09:52.100
He will finish it! Potter is a craftsman! When he buys a new pottery wheel, he will wrap it up.

09:52.101 --> 09:56.700
Wrap it up! Where will he get the money? He owes HALF THE TOWN!

09:56.701 --> 09:59.300
He owes us too, but we believe in him! He will pay everything back.

09:59.301 --> 10:07.120
Oh "yeah", he "will"...
His great-granddad built our fountain when he was his age, and your Potter can only spout pots!

10:07.121 --> 10:09.000
Let’s go. There is no use in squabbling…

10:09.006 --> 10:11.100
Geez... Have we got anything to eat?

10:11.101 --> 10:14.200
Yeap... A good piece of cheese will set our mind at ease! *laughter*

10:14.201 --> 10:17.000
You betcha! I always have something to eat!

10:17.001 --> 10:18.300
Did you cook it yourself?

10:18.301 --> 10:23.150
Grandpa did. I don’t keep house. Not in my style.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.700
Eh-h...

10:26.400 --> 10:27.600
*squeals* Huh?

10:28.300 --> 10:30.000
Hey, calm down, goofball!

10:34.600 --> 10:39.600
Shall we get it out? Maybe we shouldn’t? Maybe it’ll get out on its own?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
It’s shrieking so loud...

10:43.200 --> 10:46.000
What are you waiting for? We must save her!

10:46.400 --> 10:48.900
Let’s get the firemen. They’ll get it out.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.600
It’ll scream itself hoarse by the time they are here!

11:07.200 --> 11:09.000
Can’t you hear it’s suffering?

11:45.250 --> 11:49.400
Ouch! What’s going on?! Oo-o-o-o-uch! Where is it coming from? From above!

12:01.100 --> 12:03.100
Oh! Here's my precious!

12:03.101 --> 12:04.000
GINGER! Geez, goddamn it!

12:03.101 --> 12:05.400
Let's go home, my sweet little piggy...

12:05.401 --> 12:09.500
Goddamn this fountain! Again! Why did you get the pig into the fountain?!

12:10.300 --> 12:16.500
There you go - just look at it! She ruined the fountain! Ginger is just a trouble-maker... Who will hold responsibility for it?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.200
Is the pig alright?

12:20.300 --> 12:23.300
The pig is, but you aren’t!

12:23.301 --> 12:28.300
You’ve ruined half the town! Leave her in the well! Why did she even fret about that pig?

12:28.500 --> 12:30.000
But it’s alive!

12:33.200 --> 12:37.000
Where are you running now, goddamn you! Stop, stop immediately!

12:37.100 --> 12:41.100
Quickly, go after it! It is just useless! Time to go.

12:41.101 --> 12:42.100
Ginger...

12:42.200 --> 12:48.400
Everyone must do their bit of work. What do you do? You only make things worse.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.100
But I do – I rescue.

12:51.101 --> 12:53.300
You don’t rescue anybody, you ruin everything!

12:53.301 --> 12:56.250
How many times have you tried to ruin the fountain?

12:56.700 --> 12:58.300
Hm-m... Five?

12:58.301 --> 13:00.200
How many?!

13:00.201 --> 13:02.600
Fiv… fifteen…

13:02.610 --> 13:04.999
And how many times I told you…

13:05.000 --> 13:09.000
You should have given me a job in your team! You promised!

13:09.300 --> 13:12.400
Well… promised… e-erm…

13:12.401 --> 13:15.000
But I can’t! You are too young!

13:15.010 --> 13:18.000
Well, my birthday soon is in three days!

13:18.300 --> 13:20.000
Agrh!

13:35.700 --> 13:37.900
Do you really think the fountain should be finished?

13:38.200 --> 13:39.500
I think, yes… Yes!

13:39.501 --> 13:41.300
I think it’s good as it is...

13:41.350 --> 13:48.150
No. Look… There should be a figure, petals, and more. Can you see?

13:48.151 --> 13:55.150
It’s supposed to be much higher! And the water is to run from the top over the petals so that it looks like seamless waterfall!

13:55.160 --> 14:00.000
Then the structure will be more solemn. It’s a fountain after all...

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
... and not a chamber pot.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.900
Your great-granddad is said to make it out of red clay. I guess it is special.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.100
Do you believe in me?

14:13.101 --> 14:20.400
I do. You got this! With solemn waterfalls! We just have to find some red clay.

14:20.420 --> 14:25.800
There is no red clay. These are just stories told by your granddad, Archivist.

14:25.801 --> 14:27.100
GINGER!

14:27.300 --> 14:29.600
What have you done again?!

14:29.601 --> 14:32.700
Grandpa!.. I have to go…

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
Ag-h-h! Ouch!

14:36.900 --> 14:42.000
Where was I heading? I’m going senile...

14:43.200 --> 14:44.300
Oh! Ginger!

14:45.200 --> 14:49.900
Stop right there! I will lock you at home with that fat cat of yours!

14:50.000 --> 14:56.100
And will never let you out! I solemnly swear that I’ll do it!

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
*murmuring*

15:07.200 --> 15:08.300
What?

15:09.300 --> 15:11.400
I can’t hear you!

15:15.000 --> 15:18.500
Gyah! *heavy breath* My flap is broken!

15:18.900 --> 15:22.100
It’s your problem! Have you found the flintstone?

15:22.101 --> 15:23.200
No...

15:23.202 --> 15:31.200
What is stopping you? OOOPS... You’re so very strong and smart. Or have I misjudged you?

15:31.210 --> 15:34.100
I am not lucky, that’s it!

15:34.101 --> 15:38.100
I am not lucky, because you are an oaf!

15:38.101 --> 15:42.200
I will find it for you! I just need more time...

15:42.400 --> 15:49.200
Time?! Look at me! I am running out of time!

15:55.000 --> 15:59.800
Oh... Arcs! Of course!

16:00.000 --> 16:06.100
I have been looking for it for eight years! I will find it! You know, Your Majesty, I will do everything… for you…

16:06.101 --> 16:12.000
The elevator, shower, sewers! I even synthesized the dog fire! But it doesn’t make money!

16:12.001 --> 16:17.100
Why do I need the fire that can’t make money? Did you think of it?

16:21.100 --> 16:29.000
I know how to find the flintstone! I don’t have to dive! I’ll devise a new system! System...

16:29.001 --> 16:31.200
Ааааааh! Ааааh!

16:31.700 --> 16:34.700
Find the flintstone!

16:37.200 --> 16:40.000
Before somebody else finds it...

17:29.000 --> 17:30.400
Why are you so blue?

17:30.401 --> 17:31.300
Money!

17:31.301 --> 17:35.600
You need money again? That’s not a problem! Of course we will help you! How much?

17:35.601 --> 17:41.400
I don’t… don’t want to borrow… *laughter* …money from you!

17:41.401 --> 17:46.300
I am here to pay you back! I have paid everyone back! Everyone!

17:47.000 --> 17:48.300
And now it’s time to turn money back to you!

17:48.500 --> 17:52.000
Here is what I owe you! Thank you my friends!

17:52.300 --> 17:56.100
Grandpa! Open the door right now!

17:56.101 --> 17:58.120
Never! You are grounded!

17:58.121 --> 18:01.000
It is not fair! You cannot do this to me!

18:01.001 --> 18:09.100
Watch me do it! You are my granddaughter and I am responsible for you and your actions!

18:09.101 --> 18:12.000
You could never understand me! I was rescuing a pig!

18:12.001 --> 18:17.150
And I am rescuing the town! That’s it! Today you’re staying at home!

18:23.000 --> 18:24.200
You’ve found it!

18:24.201 --> 18:26.000
Yes, I have!

18:26.001 --> 18:28.100
You’ve found red clay!

18:28.101 --> 18:34.100
Sure! And also red, yellow, green! I found everything!

18:34.101 --> 18:37.100
I am being serious – how did you manage to pay back?

18:38.200 --> 18:44.000
Ok, ok! Jokes aside… I found treasure!

18:44.001 --> 18:45.900
Treasure?

18:47.100 --> 18:48.100
Pirate’s treasure!

18:48.101 --> 18:53.050
Do you know that pirates used to navigate our river?

18:53.051 --> 18:56.100
What do you mean?
Very slowly...

18:56.101 --> 19:01.600
On rafts! *laughter*
Potter! Stop joking! It’s not funny!

19:01.601 --> 19:04.300
Come on, smile! It is funny!

19:04.301 --> 19:09.200
Don’t want to tell me – then don’t!
Wait! Ginger!

19:14.000 --> 19:15.400
Oh well...

19:19.200 --> 19:27.000
You always calculate everything… But you’ve miscalculated my granddaughter. You messed with her head.

19:27.001 --> 19:28.000
What do you mean?

19:28.100 --> 19:37.000
That’s what I mean. The girl is from a decent family but she runs around saving everyone she can lay her eyes on.

19:37.001 --> 19:40.000
You promised to recruit her as a rescuer!

19:40.001 --> 19:43.000
And you raised her!

19:43.001 --> 19:53.100
I don't know how to raise children. She should be gentler. She is a girl after all. And this Potter…

19:53.101 --> 19:57.800
Potter… I never invited him. I don’t need any pots.

19:57.801 --> 20:04.000
Do you remember his great-granddad? He was a real craftsman! Look at the fountain he made!

20:04.001 --> 20:08.000
Ha! You lost. Again!

20:08.001 --> 20:14.000
*laughter*
Trickster! You distracted me! I will never play with you again!

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
*giggle* And… Here! Here comes… Faster! Your Majesty!

20:22.001 --> 20:27.100
System OOOPS-88. It shows everyone and everywhere!

20:27.101 --> 20:31.010
Why do you name everything OOOPS? Is it a desease?

20:31.011 --> 20:40.000
It is an abbreviation. OOOPS means Advanced Spyglass System. Model 88.

20:40.001 --> 20:43.300
High-precision mechanism! Coated glasses!
I can’t see anything.

20:43.301 --> 20:49.100
Maybe your eyesight has deteriorated? Can’t see those who are right under your nose...

20:49.101 --> 20:57.100
Moron! My eyesight is fine! Why do you think somebody has already found the flintstone and we might see smoke or fire above the town?

20:57.101 --> 21:00.100
These gizmos of yours aren’t working!

21:00.101 --> 21:05.100
You are mistaken, Your Majesty. All my gizmos work perfectly well.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.200
I should call you not OOOPS… But PUFF! Because that is what your inventions are.

21:17.200 --> 21:23.500
It… It’ll take years to dig it up! How I…! O-ouch!

21:25.000 --> 21:26.300
It’s getting on my…!

21:37.000 --> 21:41.300
What do I need clay for when I’ve got… money?

21:43.300 --> 21:45.100
I’ll buy a kiln!

21:48.000 --> 21:50.300
Haaa-haaa-haaaa! And a new pottery wheel!

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
Aha!.. Now I see. There are two of you!

22:00.200 --> 22:02.100
*coughs*

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Now, now… Now… Your Majesty!

22:06.001 --> 22:09.200
OOOPS... do you think I’ve got another life?

22:09.201 --> 22:11.020
Why?

22:13.100 --> 22:17.200
Because you are of no use in this life!

22:21.200 --> 22:25.100
The flintstone! Quickly! Go there!

22:26.100 --> 22:30.100
Sulphur dioxide, methane... The peasants are burning manure!

22:30.101 --> 22:35.100
OOOPS, it is the smell of money! My money...

22:46.300 --> 22:53.100
Universal Mobile System «OOOPS-103»! The latest development! The horse speed and power!

22:53.101 --> 23:04.000
Innovative suspension! Tires made of high carbon rubber! Triple springs two for each arm! Shock absorbers, adjustment system for-

23:04.001 --> 23:06.100
Turn to the smoke! To the left!

23:06.101 --> 23:10.000
But the road…
To the smoke, I said!

23:10.001 --> 23:13.000
It’s a delicate mechanism… I…
Faster!

23:13.001 --> 23:17.000
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

23:17.001 --> 23:24.100
The tyres… have burst! A fractu-u-ure in the… spring! Suspension… a-ah!

23:24.120 --> 23:27.000
Don’t touch the catapu…

23:27.001 --> 23:29.000
Aaaaaah!

23:29.001 --> 23:33.200
OOOPS! Why are you never near when I ne-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-d…

23:39.000 --> 23:42.100
To-o-o-o, to-o-o-o-o la-a-a-ate!

23:45.000 --> 23:49.100
Your Majesty... It’s dirty! Ha-ha...

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
You look gorgeous!

23:53.001 --> 23:57.300
Am I a joke to you? It’s just silver. It isn’t enough!

23:57.301 --> 24:01.000
I need the flintstone!
I found another one...

24:01.100 --> 24:02.600
Give it to me!

24:03.100 --> 24:04.200
These are for you...

24:04.600 --> 24:06.200
I got you some flowers!

24:06.201 --> 24:08.100
Put them in the vase.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.200
I want to apologize for the mess...

24:15.120 --> 24:19.300
I broke…
Ginger, wait, wait a second. Let me… I have to… finish.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.100
Sorry. You’re inspired, I will not distract you, finish it.

24:27.000 --> 24:32.200
Wo-o-aw… Look at that! Are they new? You really found red clay!

24:32.201 --> 24:37.220
Here!
*giggle* Awesome! Is it a new pot design?

24:40.900 --> 24:42.000
It’s a fountain...

24:42.001 --> 24:47.000
Of course, a fountain it is! It looks beautiful. A real decoration of the town...

24:47.001 --> 24:48.100
A decoration?
Em-m...

24:48.101 --> 24:53.000
All your works have something in common.

24:53.001 --> 24:56.000
Of course! Who wouldn’t recognize a pot!

24:57.000 --> 25:00.300
But my granddad always surprised everyone. No matter what he made, people admired it.

25:00.301 --> 25:05.999
When he finished the fountain, everyone just stood there the whole day looking at patterns. And what am I?!

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
I will never be able to make anything beautiful!

25:10.001 --> 25:13.300
I believe in you, Potter! I believe in you! You… You...

25:13.301 --> 25:15.300
I am a pot craftsman.

25:16.200 --> 25:24.100
You just look at Pricker ‘s suits! Shoe ‘s shoes! Hatter’s hats! And I...!

25:24.101 --> 25:25.200
Are you jealous?

25:25.201 --> 25:34.100
Yes! I am! Of their talent and skills. I’ve got talanted friends, but their friend is a loser!

25:34.101 --> 25:37.000
We’re leaving you alone. Leaving!

25:40.000 --> 25:45.200
Doesn’t matter. They will envy me really soon. All of them.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.100
OOOPS... do you know why you are OOOPS?

25:50.101 --> 25:53.200
Huh… why, Your Majesty?

25:53.220 --> 26:02.999
Because you are an awful rattle-brained person! In other words – an idiot!

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
But that’s not OOOPS.

26:05.001 --> 26:10.100
That is OOOPS. That is you.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.000
What if… like this?

26:32.300 --> 26:39.000
If we appeal to logic - smoke is a proof that somebody used the silver dog.

26:39.001 --> 26:43.020
One more strike with the flintstone and there will be fire! Where we have fire – there we have a fire!

26:43.021 --> 26:49.100
We will see it for sure! Nobody stops after the silver dog. It is possible after the copper dog… As I told you… If you had-

26:49.101 --> 26:54.000
Shut up, OOOPS! Where are we supposed to see this fire?!

27:02.050 --> 27:07.000
Ah! A fire! Quickly! Follow me! Let’s go! A fire! Hey!

27:07.100 --> 27:11.000
Where is the fire?
Look, something is burning...

27:16.130 --> 27:18.100
Where is the fire?
Nowhere!

27:18.101 --> 27:21.100
What is on fire?
Nothing! Mind your own business!

27:21.101 --> 27:25.000
The Potter’s house is on fire!
It is my business too!

27:35.000 --> 27:40.170
Ginger! For Christ’s sake! What are you doing?!

27:40.171 --> 27:49.000
Horse! Barrel! The fountain! You are being too nice to her! We should tie her up!

27:49.300 --> 27:54.300
A-ah! Buckets, hooks! Follow me! Let's go-o!

27:56.000 --> 28:01.200
Ouch! What is wrong? Where are you taking me?.. The fire is there! What’s got…

28:01.201 --> 28:07.000
Into you?! It’s tyranny! You have no right!

28:08.100 --> 28:13.300
You have all left, haven’t you? And me? Have you locked me up again? No way!

28:13.301 --> 28:21.000
I will not stay here! By no means!

28:31.000 --> 28:36.100
That’s it! The house is gone. Poor Potter...
Damn… The longer you go the less you have to do!

28:36.101 --> 28:42.000
Neither home, nor job. Pots don't burn. Stop it already! The chap is in distress.

28:42.001 --> 28:47.000
What happened here? Potter’s got a little trouble. Just a teeny-tiny one...

28:48.000 --> 28:51.200
Oh dear... No kidding…

28:52.000 --> 28:55.100
Come and stay at my place until you’ve got something of your own.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.999
Why your place? Let him stay with me.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
Don’t even argue! He is coming with me. Let’s go.

29:01.300 --> 29:05.999
Just stop it! All of you! Potter may stay with all of us in turns.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.100
Well, Let’s go. It’s getting colder. As for the house… we’ll build it.

29:11.100 --> 29:16.100
You’ll start your business again. It isn’t exactly rocket science.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.100
Huh! Where is Potter?

29:41.101 --> 29:45.100
Your Potter is just fine! He left with his friends. You should go too.

29:46.300 --> 29:48.000
We’ve got good friends.

29:48.001 --> 29:49.999
There are no good people!

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
There are plenty! And Potter is the best!

29:53.001 --> 29:58.999
What makes him the best? Has he got any money? Wealth? Glory? Power?

29:59.000 --> 30:00.200
He doesn’t need any of those.

30:00.201 --> 30:06.200
Ehe-he... Everyone does. Potter and the Queen alike.

30:06.201 --> 30:15.040
It’s not true! I don’t know about the Queen, but Potter lives for people! He works for their sake and even wants to finish the fountain!

30:15.041 --> 30:20.100
It is glory that he wants! And money. Lots of glory and lots of money!

30:20.101 --> 30:22.000
It is not true!

30:22.001 --> 30:29.700
He as well as all people in this town want the same thing! They’re all hungry for wealth and power!

30:30.000 --> 30:34.999
All our townsfolk are remarkable! They are sincere and unselfish!

30:35.200 --> 30:41.200
Come to my birthday in three days and see for yourself! I’ll be happy to see you!

30:49.000 --> 30:51.200
What a stupid girl...

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
Or course you may stay at Ginger’s house, but Archivist will never let you in.

31:02.200 --> 31:06.000
He will let you in. But he won’t let you out in one piece.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.300
By the way, Ginger’s birthday is coming!

31:10.310 --> 31:15.999
I am going to make her a hat. The most beautiful hat! With a feather!

31:16.000 --> 31:19.100
And I am going to make her red boots. Because she is Ginger!

31:19.101 --> 31:22.999
As for me I’ll make her a fire-fighter jacket.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.200
And then we’ll dance polka!

31:25.201 --> 31:31.400
Ha-ha! Because of the hat with a feather? Don’t be ridiculous? She'll tap dance with me!

31:32.300 --> 31:42.200
In the red boots! The fire-fighting jacket…. That is the real thing! So the first dance will be mine. Rescuer’s tango!

31:42.201 --> 31:49.000
No! Ginger… she is my… She and I… Because I…her…

31:50.000 --> 31:56.110
On her birthday, she will waltz. With me. Is it clear?

32:03.200 --> 32:07.300
How are you? Are you fine?

32:08.000 --> 32:13.100
I am. I am going to stay overnight at Hatter’s. How about you?

32:14.120 --> 32:18.000
I am fine to-o-o-o!

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
Grandpa! Muah! Muah-muah-muah!

32:26.001 --> 32:31.000
Dear grandpa! Tell me: how do I arrange a perfect party for my guests? I want to do everything on my own.

32:31.001 --> 32:32.998
Guests?

32:33.000 --> 32:36.100
You want to have a party all by yourself?!

32:36.101 --> 32:41.998
I do! Yes, of course! So that everyone is… *laughter*

32:42.000 --> 32:50.200
Well… The formula is easy! Tidy up the house, decorate it, make some cakes, invite musicians…

32:50.201 --> 32:55.200
"Housekeeping", the sixth shelf, the seventh book on the left!

32:57.200 --> 32:59.100
A-ah!.. How beautiful!

32:59.200 --> 33:02.200
Grandpa, let’s first decorate it and then tidy it up?

33:02.201 --> 33:05.400
Knock it off, Ginger! Time to go to bed!

33:06.100 --> 33:09.100
I’ll do it myself! On my own! Sit.

33:09.101 --> 33:13.120
I just have to put some oil and light them up!

33:14.300 --> 33:17.000
Why are you lightening them? Now?

33:20.000 --> 33:23.998
When am I supposed to light them if not at night?

33:24.000 --> 33:30.000
Ginger!
Not Ginger, Sunshine! - Lots of sunshine!

33:34.000 --> 33:37.100
Phew... You’re just in time!

33:40.000 --> 33:42.998
Ginger, can I take the horse?

33:43.000 --> 33:48.100
Of course… I… Me…

33:50.100 --> 33:53.000
And now time for cleaning!
Ginger! Go to bed!

33:59.100 --> 34:05.100
Many people underestimate the role of a hat in an outfit. But they’re all wrong.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.100
It is not just a head-dress. Your head-dress determines thoughts in your head.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.200
Just calm down and take a seat!

34:17.000 --> 34:22.210
I’ll make a hat for Ginger and she’ll be a real hero in it.

34:22.211 --> 34:24.000
You think so?

34:25.200 --> 34:29.150
Absolutely! The head-dress determines the person.

34:29.151 --> 34:33.000
If you wear a bucket hat, you won’t stop drooling.

34:33.010 --> 34:37.200
A shady hat makes you look romantic.

34:38.000 --> 34:44.000
If you wear a top hat… everyone can see you’ve got money!

34:53.120 --> 34:58.000
*laughter* This hat is for fun. A masquerade. To make people laugh.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.100
Whoa-a-ah!

35:02.100 --> 35:04.000
What was it?

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
I have no idea. But it is very funny.

35:24.130 --> 35:31.400
OOOPS, my dear OOOPS... you’re so inventive… You’re an outstanding scientist!

35:32.000 --> 35:38.300
You’re practically a genius! You’re the greatest mind in my whole kingdom.

35:39.100 --> 35:43.000
Why can’t you steal the flintstone!?

35:43.200 --> 35:45.000
I’ve never learnt to steal...

35:45.001 --> 35:49.998
Then go and learn! If you want to stay in the castle.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.200
Wait up!

36:43.100 --> 36:48.210
I wanted to tell you that you’re the best musicians in this town! And the only ones! *giggle* That is why you’re the best.

36:48.211 --> 36:53.000
Please, come to my birthday party. As musicians. And as guests.

36:53.100 --> 36:54.000
When is it?

36:54.010 --> 37:03.100
The evening after tomorrow. Everyone will be there. Feast, jokes, laughter, ginger lights! And you will play? Deal?

37:03.101 --> 37:05.000
Okey-dockey~

37:05.001 --> 37:08.100
Please, without lights! You’re just enough!

37:08.101 --> 37:12.000
I am mature now and I have steadied down.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.140
You sort them out and let’s get them to the market tomorrow, okay?

38:20.200 --> 38:23.200
Uh-huh…
And a day after tomorrow we’re going to Ginger’s!

38:23.201 --> 38:28.170
Look at the present I’m making for her. What do you think? Are they beautiful?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.170
Meh… They are just boots.

38:31.171 --> 38:39.100
You don’t say so! Footwear is the most important part in a person! Shoes determine whether you follow the way you’ve chosen.

38:39.120 --> 38:44.000
What if your boots don’t fit you properly? You won’t reach your destination!

38:44.001 --> 38:49.100
If shoes are a perfect fit the sky is the limit! I mean – the road.

38:49.101 --> 38:54.100
I think Ginger will love them! What are you going to give her? A po-

38:54.101 --> 39:00.000
Yes! A pot! Of course a pot! What else can I make?

39:00.001 --> 39:05.100
You are all so pompous! One has made loads of hats, another - a pile of shoes!

39:05.101 --> 39:07.100
What is…? What has got into you?

39:07.101 --> 39:12.000
Nothing has got into me...
Very well then. Don’t throw the shoes!

39:12.040 --> 39:15.000
Be gentle with them, with love.

39:16.150 --> 39:18.000
What? Who is there?

39:25.160 --> 39:33.000
Let’s not be lazy! You should not just play but dazzle everyone with your talent and virtuosity!

39:34.200 --> 39:38.000
Uh... Talent is exactly what we’ve got.
So!

39:42.000 --> 39:53.100
What’s this noise? It’s Ginger again! What on earth is this? …unleash the dogs now!

40:05.100 --> 40:10.200
Y-your Majesty! Careful… Up! Your Majesty!

40:10.201 --> 40:12.000
Where is the flintstone?

40:12.001 --> 40:13.300
It's right here!

40:16.100 --> 40:22.000
Are you jocking on old lady? I don’t find it amusing...

40:22.001 --> 40:26.000
I will annihilate you!

40:30.000 --> 40:37.000
Do you want... that the whole town... find out about the flinstone?

40:40.000 --> 40:46.000
Anyone can see the flintstone! If anyone lays their hands on it...

40:48.100 --> 40:51.100
I must have the flintstone tomorrow!

40:55.000 --> 41:00.140
Can’t you see, I have no time or money left...

41:02.300 --> 41:06.000
On the plus side, you’ve got a perfect ear for music!

41:08.000 --> 41:10.100
No… no… no! All wrong! Let’s start again…

41:10.101 --> 41:11.170
…On the count of two!

41:11.180 --> 41:13.200
What does it mean?

41:13.300 --> 41:17.000
I have no idea… Let’s start from the beginning!

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Are they torturing a cat!?

41:24.010 --> 41:26.300
So! Where is your dog fire?

41:26.301 --> 41:28.220
There's is!

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
No! Are you crazy!?
Yes!

41:32.001 --> 41:35.998
You can’t! We will burn alive! Your Majesty, this…

41:36.000 --> 41:41.000
This fire burns through rock as if it were paper! You can turn it on only if the tanks are connected to the system!

41:41.001 --> 41:42.200
Which system?

41:45.100 --> 41:51.100
Unified Redistributive System! OOOPS-66!

41:51.101 --> 41:59.100
I use the town utility services to control water, air and fire distribution all over the castle and even the town from my workshop.

41:59.101 --> 42:04.200
For example. Look here, Your Majesty! I connect the tank with compressed air to the system. Hmm!

42:04.201 --> 42:09.150
Rewire... and now townsfolk have got not water...

42:09.151 --> 42:15.170
but puff in their taps! Air! *laughter*

42:17.000 --> 42:19.080
And now, the town fountain may...

42:19.100 --> 42:22.995
What about the tanks?
Of course! They are full of fire!

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
But it can’t make money...

42:26.001 --> 42:28.200
I can’t find another use for them.

42:28.201 --> 42:33.000
I will. Everyone will be happy. *laughter*

42:33.001 --> 42:35.000
If anybody survives.

42:35.200 --> 42:40.200
My friends! You all know me! And you love me!

42:40.201 --> 42:45.000
I am inviting all of you to my birthday party tomorrow!

42:45.010 --> 42:48.040
There will be lots of yummy cakes!

42:50.000 --> 42:54.100
Ginger! Your dough seems to be running away!

42:56.200 --> 42:58.000
O-ops...

43:06.200 --> 43:12.000
Clothing is like our second skin. I would even say – the first.

43:12.200 --> 43:20.000
Nice clothing makes people beautiful. Comfortable clothing makes people happy!

43:20.001 --> 43:25.500
It’s coming out nicely. How do you think – will Ginger like it?

43:27.000 --> 43:30.200
I don’t know. How can I know what she might like?

43:30.201 --> 43:32.000
I don’t understand…

43:32.800 --> 43:35.999
Why does she have to like everything you make?

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Who are you talking about?
And who are you talking about?

43:39.000 --> 43:42.100
If you are good at everything you do then you think you may treat me this way?

43:42.101 --> 43:46.200
What are you talking about? Just as Ginger is our friend, so you are!

43:46.201 --> 43:50.000
No, I am not… I am different!
Listen.

43:50.001 --> 43:57.000
Stop yelling at me! Or else I might get hurt! I’m already doing it!

43:57.100 --> 44:02.000
Getting Why don’t I get peeved at you? Why hurt?

44:02.100 --> 44:08.200
I might not just get peeved, but become really mad! I am already doing it!

44:09.000 --> 44:13.020
Forget it. I've lost my temper.
Um. That’s okay.

44:13.021 --> 44:16.000
More so as it isn’t my best piece of work...

44:40.000 --> 44:41.100
How do I zoom it in?

45:01.200 --> 45:03.200
Where is the flintstone?

45:05.000 --> 45:10.100
Do you even realize that without it I am doomed? My life is running out!

45:12.240 --> 45:15.200
Look at all that!

45:18.020 --> 45:25.100
That is the girl of stupid Potter! Now they are in possession of the flintstone.

45:25.101 --> 45:27.200
And soon the whole town will know about that!

45:27.210 --> 45:37.100
Rascals, swindlers, scallwags! They will pass the flintstone around!

45:37.101 --> 45:49.100
They all used to be my servants! Pathetic meanlowlife! How I hate them all!

45:49.101 --> 45:53.200
Get lost! I’ll do everything myself! Without any help!

45:53.201 --> 45:57.000
The more so as now I have the invitation.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Well, I’ll do everything myself as well.

46:53.000 --> 46:53.900
You’re lucky, you are…

46:53.900 --> 46:56.100
…ginger, everyone loves you.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.800
No one is expecting anything from you. You’re just a cat.

46:57.800 --> 47:05.800
But I am a genius! Unappreciated by others, especially the Queen!

47:05.800 --> 47:09.800
But wait, I’ll prove it to her!

47:10.000 --> 47:11.800
Where are the pies?

47:17.000 --> 47:18.800
Here you are, Granny!

47:18.800 --> 47:21.800
Nice to see you’ve made it! I’ll introduce you to everyone!

47:21.800 --> 47:24.800
I don’t want to be introduced to anybody!

47:24.800 --> 47:25.800
Look, here are our wonderful friends!

47:25.800 --> 47:26.800
This is Shoe,

47:26.800 --> 47:27.800
here is Hatter

47:27.800 --> 47:29.800
and this one is Pricker!

47:29.800 --> 47:30.800
There is nothing they can’t do!

47:30.800 --> 47:32.800
Has Potter arrived yet?

47:32.800 --> 47:35.800
We haven’t seen him.
He’ll come. He will…

47:39.800 --> 47:41.800
Where are you going?

47:41.800 --> 47:44.800
Granny, let me introduce you to my Grandpa!

47:44.800 --> 47:46.800
I am not a granny at all!

47:44.800 --> 47:48.800
And I don’t need your Grandpa!

47:48.800 --> 47:49.800
Where is your Potter?

47:49.800 --> 47:52.800
He will come no matter what!

47:54.800 --> 47:56.800
These are the dwellers of our town.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.800
Widely different but as I told you,

48:00.800 --> 48:02.800
sincere and selfless people

48:02.800 --> 48:04.800
Look at their happy and smiling faces!

48:06.800 --> 48:08.800
Have you seen Potter?

48:09.800 --> 48:11.800
So where is your “best of them all”?

48:11.800 --> 48:13.800
I’m sure he is on his way!

48:13.800 --> 48:16.800
Potter is so kind… And strong…

48:16.800 --> 48:17.800
He and I…

48:17.800 --> 48:20.800
Here he is!

48:21.800 --> 48:22.800
Ginger!

48:22.800 --> 48:23.800
Happy Birthday!

48:24.000 --> 48:25.800
Hello!

48:25.800 --> 48:28.800
I want to wish you on your birthday to be always...

48:31.800 --> 48:32.800
Waltz!

48:32.800 --> 48:34.800
On the count of two…

49:10.800 --> 49:13.800
Ginger! Look!

49:13.800 --> 49:15.800
Novelty of the season…

49:15.800 --> 49:20.800
Hats with feathers! Neither rain nor ado will destroy your hairdo!

49:21.800 --> 49:24.800
A beautiful boot for a beautiful foot!

49:24.800 --> 49:27.800
Made of leather – to withstand all weather!

49:29.000 --> 49:32.800
These dresses are the best,

49:32.900 --> 49:34.800
from now till the rest...

49:35.800 --> 49:37.800
U-u-h… So crafters?

49:37.800 --> 49:40.800
Shoe, why are you so silent?

49:40.800 --> 49:42.800
Can you make boots like these?

49:42.800 --> 49:45.800
Yours shoes don’t even come close to these!

49:46.900 --> 49:48.800
Just look at the hats! Look Hatter!

49:48.800 --> 49:53.000
Can you imagine what thoughts come to mind when you wear a hat like this?

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Great ones!

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
Not to be compared with those that come up under this hollow top hat!

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
And the dresses.. Pricker!

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
Look here!

50:01.000 --> 50:06.000
Velvet, crêpe de Chine, silk, brocade! That’s a job well done, but by someone other than you!

50:07.000 --> 50:08.000
What do you say?

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
These were made by real craftsmen!

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
As for you,

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
You are good for nothing!

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Who is that?
Don’t you recognize him?

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
No…
Was that Potter? I haven’t recognized him.
Where did he get all that?

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Ginger!

50:20.000 --> 50:27.000
I want you to take off these lousy shoddies and put on truly beautiful pieces of work!

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
That is exactly what I am wearing!

50:31.000 --> 50:35.000
And you… you... Erm… What’s with this masquerade?

50:35.000 --> 50:36.000
I don’t get it!

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
Where are my troopers?

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
These are dumb mannequins!

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
Well…

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
What “well”?

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
Where are my brave warriors and heroes?! They’ve...

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
...turned into morons!

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
Models! I’ll make scarecrows out of you!

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
What’s got into you? Why are you yelling at them? They walked the runways nicely!

50:58.000 --> 51:02.000
Now they will run nicely! Then crawl nicely!

51:03.000 --> 51:07.000
Double time ma-a-a-a-arch!

51:07.000 --> 51:10.000
Time to go
Come, come!

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Everything has turned into madness! As always.
Ruined the party.

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
Potter put on a barbed show with presents!
Nothing is ever right when Ginger is around!

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
Keep going. let’s get out of here
Haven’t even tried any pies
Haven’t enjoyed the music

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Maybe he was joking?
Potter and sense of humour? Have you seen his pots?

51:19.000 --> 51:23.000
What did you say? You think it is a masquerade?

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
Let’s see what you’ll say about the final touch then!

51:30.100 --> 51:31.540
Why did he treat us like that?

51:32.100 --> 51:33.760
Something is wrong with Potter.

51:34.160 --> 51:35.470
I'm telling you.

51:35.500 --> 51:37.900
Hear-hear! "when you wear a hat like this..."

51:38.100 --> 51:38.998
And look at what he got!

51:39.040 --> 51:42.100
Ridiculous rubbish! "My shoes...

51:42.120 --> 51:44.930
...don't even come close to those."

51:45.100 --> 51:45.998
Where did he get...

51:46.160 --> 51:48.600
...all that?
He has always been a loser!

51:48.620 --> 51:51.350
What's the meaning of all that?
This...

51:52.660 --> 51:56.730
...is magic!
Huh? Who is that?

51:57.100 --> 51:58.500
A clown, maybe.

51:59.410 --> 52:00.260
Potter invited him...

52:01.290 --> 52:01.970
...to entertain the guests.

52:03.660 --> 52:10.000
It is full of ancient wisdom, you can never find in book!

52:10.001 --> 52:17.000
Mysteries and incantations, spooky mojos, tons of spells!

52:17.130 --> 52:24.000
Blessing, love and suffering, it can give you anything!

52:25.000 --> 52:31.220
It affects your innermost, it can make your brain burst!

52:32.000 --> 52:38.030
Magic does it all! Ma-a-agic!

52:38.040 --> 52:44.000
White and black! And even green!

52:45.000 --> 52:52.000
Magic can do anything! Magic! Ma-a-agic!

52:52.100 --> 52:59.000
Red and blue! Yellow with dotty flecks!

52:59.100 --> 53:11.000
Magic can do anything! Magic can do anything!

53:11.950 --> 53:13.600
No peace during the day nor at night!

53:15.250 --> 53:20.150
I am not a clown! I am the greatest Magician...

53:20.250 --> 53:21.690
...and Spell-weaver!

53:22.100 --> 53:23.700
As for Potter. He is bewitched!

53:23.800 --> 53:26.700
By who?
It doesn't matter!

53:26.700 --> 53:32.800
What really matters is that if the curse isn't lifted, he might die!

53:33.990 --> 53:37.220
That explains a lot.
That explains everything!

53:38.290 --> 53:39.290
How do we break the spell?

53:39.500 --> 53:44.180
Only I can do it! But!

53:45.080 --> 53:46.950
YOU must get into his house!

53:47.410 --> 53:49.410
Incognito...

53:49.500 --> 53:51.900
Then you must hide...
How do we have to get in?

53:52.100 --> 53:53.600
Incognito, i.e. unnoticed.

53:53.700 --> 53:58.500
That's very important. You must get in, wait until Potter falls asleep...

53:58.910 --> 54:03.700
...and take the flintstone off his neck. Flintstone!

54:03.830 --> 54:07.230
You must bring it to me.
And I will break the spell and free Potter!

54:07.580 --> 54:11.100
Oh...
What do you mean by "get in"?
Let alone incognito!

54:14.100 --> 54:16.700
Here!
Oh well!

54:16.830 --> 54:22.600
OOOPS 207 Universal Perforating System!

54:22.830 --> 54:24.630
It... It is magic!..

54:25.100 --> 54:25.700
It is science!

54:28.990 --> 54:29.990
Here!

54:31.160 --> 54:32.900
Why? What for?

54:33.200 --> 54:36.250
Because it is the best present anyone has ever given to you!

54:37.100 --> 54:38.700
Why did you hurt your friends?

54:39.100 --> 54:40.970
Did you want to humiliate them? But why?

54:41.000 --> 54:44.900
They've got nothing to do with it? I wanted to show you
That I am the best!

54:44.999 --> 54:48.600
The best because the things you can't make you can buy with money?

54:49.000 --> 54:54.600
What's wrong with that? I can buy their shop...  and sell it together with them!

54:55.160 --> 54:56.840
But I'm not doing it!

54:57.330 --> 54:58.600
Do you see that red lever?

54:59.120 --> 55:01.720
Is there an easier way to take the flintstone from Potter?

55:02.000 --> 55:03.600
No, there is not.

55:03.100 --> 55:04.600
Can you see the red lever there?

55:05.100 --> 55:08.600
So?
That is OOOPS 208! Self-Sufficient Tunneling Operation!

55:09.100 --> 55:13.700
The machine will take you there on its own. After you take the flintstone from Potter, get back in...

55:14.100 --> 55:16.600
...and pull this lever down and the machine will...

55:17.100 --> 55:18.820
...take you back.

55:19.100 --> 55:21.810
That's it! I'll be waiting for you ...here. Did you get it?

55:22.000 --> 55:22.500
We got it!

55:23.100 --> 55:23.700
What's this wheel?

55:24.100 --> 55:27.800
A-ah! I told you not to touch anything else!

55:29.100 --> 55:30.800
I would say he is a clown after all!

55:46.100 --> 55:46.950
Hey!

55:47.100 --> 55:47.700
A-heey! Guys!

55:48.100 --> 55:51.700
Are you alive? Are you there? Are you with me?

55:54.100 --> 55:54.700
Oh...

55:55.100 --> 56:00.850
How embarrassing. Seems like I am a clown. Not a funny one.

56:03.100 --> 56:03.800
Poor guys...

56:05.230 --> 56:10.200
To hell with the shop! I can buy the whole market!

56:10.210 --> 56:12.170
What is wrong with you?
Nothing!

56:12.171 --> 56:14.000
I am perfectly well!

56:14.200 --> 56:15.160
You’ve changed!

56:15.161 --> 56:20.110
And what’s wrong with that? On the contrary – it’s great! Take the tree!

56:20.111 --> 56:24.600
I don’t need your money tree! I needed you. But now…

56:24.601 --> 56:25.998
What «but now»?

56:26.000 --> 56:30.100
Now… you’re not as you used to be!
As I used to be?! What did I use to be?

56:30.110 --> 56:32.220
Down trodden loser, is that who you need?

56:32.221 --> 56:37.700
Have forgotten how others mocked me? How they reproached me for not being able to finish the fountain!

56:37.701 --> 56:44.900
And now I can buy it! I can buy a fountain that will immortalize me in this town!

56:44.901 --> 56:48.400
You’re proud of what you can buy not of what you can create?

56:48.401 --> 56:56.000
You’re proud of not yourself but of the money that you haven’t even earned!

56:58.200 --> 57:02.200
You should start all over! Find red clay!

57:02.201 --> 57:10.000
What are you talking about! Forget these fairytales! It doesn’t exist! Doesn’t! Do you understand? It doesn’t exist!

57:10.001 --> 57:14.000
Doesn’t exist?! Doesn't...?

57:21.000 --> 57:23.998
She is no match for you…

57:24.000 --> 57:29.998
You gave her such… wonderful presents! And she couldn’t appreciate them.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.100
Presents like these can only be appreciated by the Queen.

57:33.110 --> 57:37.000
I keep telling her…
Don't tell her!

57:37.001 --> 57:41.998
Tell the Queen! You are so rich...

57:42.000 --> 57:48.998
Why don’t you become a King? You could do people a lot of good and make them happy!

57:49.000 --> 57:50.100
A King...

57:50.101 --> 57:56.000
Why not? You’ve got money. Now you can get the power! You’ll be able to help everyone!

57:56.001 --> 57:57.998
I thought...

57:58.000 --> 58:04.998
Yeah, you thought a lot of things. That you had friends and a girl… You should go to the Queen!

58:05.000 --> 58:09.100
That’s where true happiness is! Yours!

58:36.200 --> 58:45.100
I am a good for nothing inventor. I am ballast… A waste of space! I am vacuum!

58:45.170 --> 58:50.100
Don’t make a mountain out of a molehill, OOOPS. You just had bad luck!

58:51.100 --> 58:55.200
Your Majesty! You are beautiful!

58:55.600 --> 58:59.000
I know. A bride should be beauty-ful.

58:59.001 --> 59:02.000
A bride? Are you… getting married?

59:02.001 --> 59:07.100
Ah! A woman would do whatever it takes to find happiness!

59:07.101 --> 59:09.000
Who is your chosen one?

59:09.001 --> 59:13.000
Ha-ha-ha! Potter. You know him.

59:14.000 --> 59:24.000
Potter? Ahem... Aah… Of course! He’s got the flintstone! Well then, I’ll arrange a festive-

59:24.020 --> 59:30.100
I don’t want any feasts! Devise me bright colourful water so that it glows. And fill the fountain with it.

59:30.110 --> 59:36.120
I’ll have a water extravaganza at my wedding! Let the whole town enjoy and be happy!

59:37.000 --> 59:38.100
... For the last time.

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.890
That was the final straw! She's ruined the fountain! We must capture her and lock her up!

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.800
Get her! The fountain?!

1:00:44.100 --> 1:00:45.720
It can't go on like this! Come with us! Ha!

1:00:46.100 --> 1:00:48.800
She's running to Potter's!

1:01:00.100 --> 1:01:04.800
No, we shouldn't go backward. Keep going ahead! Where ahead? Are we near his house yet?

1:01:05.100 --> 1:01:11.900
Then we must stop! We will stop when we are supposed to! I'm telling you, turn it around! I'll turn YOU around now! It'll stop when it has to!

1:01:12.100 --> 1:01:17.760
Shoe, stop wheezing! And don't breathe like this! And stop yanking at it! The clown told us not to touch anything in here!

1:01:17.766 --> 1:01:20.850
I'm not touching anything! You are! No, I am not!

1:01:21.100 --> 1:01:24.600
Sit tight then! I am! And stop wheezing in my ear!

1:01:38.100 --> 1:01:39.999
What are you doing here? I didn't invite you!

1:01:40.100 --> 1:01:41.700
How did you get here?

1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:43.600
What's going on Potter?

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:45.880
What's the matter with you?

1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:50.150
You are a crafter! You must work! You must finish the fountain!

1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:52.500
Others should be proud of you!

1:01:53.250 --> 1:01:54.500
They all will be proud of me!

1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:55.999
I am working!

1:01:56.200 --> 1:01:57.970
And you're getting in the way!

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.200
Working? But your wheel is clean and the kiln is cold!

1:02:02.100 --> 1:02:03.700
Don't touch it!

1:02:09.370 --> 1:02:16.500
A dog! A real dog! Where did you come from, little chap?
It isn't real!

1:02:16.550 --> 1:02:18.560
It's a special dog! For work!

1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:20.560
Didn't you want me to work?

1:02:20.560 --> 1:02:21.100
Give it to me!

1:02:22.100 --> 1:02:24.600
You're scaring it! It's trembling!

1:02:25.370 --> 1:02:27.600
Why is it wearing a collar? It doesn't let it breathe properly.

1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:33.100
What have you done!

1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:34.800
You are not welcome here!

1:02:35.250 --> 1:02:37.000
Why are you always ruining everything?!

1:02:37.100 --> 1:02:39.200
Why can't you mind your own business?

1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:41.500
Who allowed you to touch my flintstone?!

1:02:44.100 --> 1:02:46.600
You know what?

1:02:48.040 --> 1:02:52.100
This dog was just as useless as you are!

1:02:52.290 --> 1:02:54.390
Make yourself scarce with that lousy dog!

1:02:58.620 --> 1:03:08.600
We've had just enough! Why did you destroy the fountain? There is nothing sacred for you! These are all just jokes to you!

1:03:10.040 --> 1:03:11.300
Why are you even listening to her?

1:03:11.301 --> 1:03:13.640
Let's throw her out of the town! Hear-hear!

1:03:13.641 --> 1:03:17.560
Get out of the town! Stop destroying it! Off you go! Go away!

1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:20.040
The Queen!

1:03:27.330 --> 1:03:29.010
Are you the Potter?

1:03:29.040 --> 1:03:30.999
Yeeaah...Your Majesty.

1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.999
Drop the formalities. Call me Filaura.

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.999
Potter! There's something important I'd like to discuss with you.

1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:40.140
I heard you wanted to become the king right?

1:03:42.660 --> 1:03:47.730
Yees... Yes. Absolutely.
Ha-ha-ha! I say "yes"!

1:03:48.660 --> 1:03:50.610
You really are the worthiest of the worthiest!

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.720
The day of our wedding will be announced later.

1:03:56.330 --> 1:03:57.640
I'll be waiting for you in the castle, honey.

1:04:02.100 --> 1:04:03.690
Did all of you hear that?!

1:04:03.700 --> 1:04:07.840
I'm marrying the Queen!

1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:11.850
You've destroyed the fountain!

1:04:12.250 --> 1:04:15.930
You will never be a rescuer. Never ever!

1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:20.660
I'm supposed to be saving people from elementsnoy from you.

1:04:51.660 --> 1:04:53.660
This place has become so off-putting.

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:56.510
Some strange animals come up from nowhere! *screams*

1:04:57.870 --> 1:05:00.640
Small dogs like this grow into monsters!

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:05.110
Not just monsters. There is a fire-dragon under the town!

1:05:06.100 --> 1:05:09.680
They say, it lives under the ground and it's going to eat us all soon.

1:05:11.100 --> 1:05:13.420
They say, buildings have already started collapsing!

1:05:19.130 --> 1:05:24.000
What a wonderful day! OOOPS! Is everything ready for the wedding?

1:05:24.001 --> 1:05:28.200
Yes.
What about blazing water for the celebration?
200 barrels.

1:05:28.201 --> 1:05:30.300
Does it shine?
Glows...

1:05:30.301 --> 1:05:33.100
Let’s discuss the plan of the ceremony again.

1:05:33.101 --> 1:05:38.998
First, we go over the bridge, then – into the tower. There Potter takes the crown and sits on the throne.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:46.100
And the most important part - as soon as you see that Potter has the crown you demolish the bridge, lock the doors-

1:05:46.101 --> 1:05:50.000
and shutters in the castle! Remember?

1:05:50.001 --> 1:05:54.200
And only after that you let your blazing water into the town!

1:05:54.201 --> 1:05:57.000
The feast begins!

1:05:57.001 --> 1:06:01.510
Into all pipes! All of them! Under the tower and into the town fountain!

1:06:01.511 --> 1:06:04.220
Got that?
Why do I have to demolish the bridge?

1:06:04.220 --> 1:06:09.998
It’s my whim! I’m going to burn bridges behind me!

1:06:10.100 --> 1:06:13.210
Stop asking stupid questions! I want to be left alone with my fiance!

1:06:13.211 --> 1:06:18.010
That’s how I want it! Nobody can get in the way!

1:06:18.011 --> 1:06:22.120
How we leave later, I’ll decide it later… And no questions!

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.120
As you wish... Your Majesty.

1:06:32.100 --> 1:06:35.100
You should eat something...

1:06:38.100 --> 1:06:41.100
Go and take a walk...

1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:51.000
Well... Maybe read something. Maybe you want me to read to you? As we used to do, do you... remember?

1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:58.000
Ginger! Ginger...

1:06:58.001 --> 1:07:00.000
How's she?

1:07:01.300 --> 1:07:03.100
Do you read…?
No.

1:07:03.101 --> 1:07:07.200
I used to read it to her when she was little. «The Tale of the Red Clay».

1:07:07.201 --> 1:07:11.130
You keep reading fairy-tales...  A game of chess?

1:07:12.200 --> 1:07:16.100
What? Do you remember how to play?
I do.

1:07:17.150 --> 1:07:27.100
I saw Potter. He went to the Queen to ask for her hand in marriage. He is a big shot now. Soon he’ll be the king!

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:31.070
Ginger!? What’s wrong, my dear girl?

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.100
What are you doing, my sweetie?

1:07:35.101 --> 1:07:37.120
We don't need these pots!

1:07:37.121 --> 1:07:41.000
It is a fact!
Nobody needs them! Calm down!

1:07:41.001 --> 1:07:45.100
I am calm! I am terribly calm!

1:07:45.101 --> 1:07:48.998
Forget about the pots...
And about hat Potter… The king – no big deal!

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.100
I have already forgotten about him!

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.000
Flint... Stone?

1:08:00.001 --> 1:08:10.100
The flintstone is temptation itself.
Temptation?

1:08:10.101 --> 1:08:13.000
It’s nearly gone...

1:08:13.010 --> 1:08:21.000
Uh… First comes the copper dog - it's a source of copper coins. It rids the master of the need as long as he can stop.

1:08:21.001 --> 1:08:23.100
Copper dog...

1:08:23.110 --> 1:08:33.000
The silver dog will block the sky with smoke and in vile envy shall be drowned the miserable flintstone’s master, unless-

1:08:33.001 --> 1:08:37.100
he summons the dog setting everything ablaze!

1:08:37.101 --> 1:08:40.210
Ablaze? Everything? The dog!

1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:47.300
He’ll be devoured by insatiable greed for gold...
Another problem!

1:08:47.301 --> 1:08:54.000
He’ll feed on money! Otherwise, he’s dead at once.

1:08:54.001 --> 1:08:55.300
He’s going to die!

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.000
…are you going? Finish reading!

1:08:58.100 --> 1:09:05.200
The last flintstone’s secret…
Another secret? Fire dogs! They’ll burn everything down!

1:09:05.201 --> 1:09:07.100
The secret!...
What is it?!

1:09:07.101 --> 1:09:11.050
That's it. Entries in the book break off...

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:20.998
Listen! The flintstone! I know that legend! Well, I used to know... My memory is failing me…

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:25.100
Try to remember! What else might happen?

1:09:36.110 --> 1:09:39.000
What is the secret?
I can’t remember...

1:09:39.100 --> 1:09:43.100
I read it when I was young…
Where did you read it? In the library?

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:48.100
In the square by the new fountain. I was holding the third page...

1:09:48.101 --> 1:09:55.400
I remember splashes going my way... Wind... Splashes... The page was all wet and it got destroyed.

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:57.200
But I managed to read it!

1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.999
Let’s go to the fountain!

1:10:00.100 --> 1:10:02.500
You will remember!

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000
The fire will purify everything!

1:10:15.100 --> 1:10:20.100
This town with its stupid vassals and back-scratchers who left me alone!

1:10:20.101 --> 1:10:24.000
And the flintstone will be mine!

1:10:24.001 --> 1:10:28.000
So, here does this hose go?.. Ah, here!

1:10:28.001 --> 1:10:33.100
Who is that Potter? Moron! Lousy, good-for-nothing looser!

1:10:33.101 --> 1:10:37.000
He thinks he can be a king! *laughter*

1:10:37.001 --> 1:10:41.999
So he gets in the tower, takes the crown and that’s when he faces his death!

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:48.000
A king! For a minute. His last minute!

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:55.030
That’s it! You’re done for! You’ll perish in the flame, Your Majesty!

1:10:55.031 --> 1:11:01.000
King Potter! No one will ever heard anything about this third-rater!

1:11:01.001 --> 1:11:08.100
Brighter than the sun will this show be!

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.100
The World will turn to dust instantly!

1:11:14.101 --> 1:11:21.000
Those who betrayed me! Who left me all alone!

1:11:21.001 --> 1:11:28.200
Will fall down at my feet as ash! Submissively!

1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:35.200
May they all go down in flames! This moment will be priceless!

1:11:35.201 --> 1:11:43.000
I’ll repay them all with interest! The fire of my vengeance-

1:11:43.001 --> 1:11:49.999
Will kno-o-o-ock on every do-o-o-or!

1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:54.000
Ginger! She did it again! She’s a catastrophe, not a girl!

1:11:54.001 --> 1:11:58.000
What happened to the water? Well, she couldn’t possibly drink it all! You can never know with her!

1:11:58.100 --> 1:12:02.000
We must throw her out of the town! And say goodbye to her!

1:12:02.300 --> 1:12:06.000
Well hello my future king!

1:12:06.001 --> 1:12:13.100
Hello… Fi... la... I mean, Your… fi... Fijesty… I mean, jesty… urm…

1:12:13.101 --> 1:12:18.000
I could listen to this forever… Come in, My dearest.

1:12:18.001 --> 1:12:20.999
You may go, OOOPS!
But maybe...

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:24.200
OOOPS, you are no longer needed here!

1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:29.000
That Ginger is nothing but trouble! What's going on here?

1:12:29.001 --> 1:12:32.000
Her granddad is here… Where is he? Over there!

1:12:32.001 --> 1:12:33.999
Think!
But I can't!

1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:36.400
There were splashes!
Splashes?..

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.200
You’ll get your splashes!

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:42.300
What are you doing?... I’ve just remembered!

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:48.000
And forgot… Again…

1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:55.300
Allow me to help you with that… Let’s straighten it here and here.

1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:01.100
Oh my darling...
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1:13:01.101 --> 1:13:07.100
Soon you’ll be the Majesty too. And together we will rule this town!

1:13:08.001 --> 1:13:10.100
May she be happy.

1:13:11.001 --> 1:13:13.100
And I’ll disappear.

1:13:18.001 --> 1:13:19.100
I am not the flintstone!

1:13:19.001 --> 1:13:21.100
I am just… just… OOOPS!

1:13:25.001 --> 1:13:28.100
There is just one ritual left. It is an ancient coronation ceremony.

1:13:28.100 --> 1:13:32.100
The future king must take the crown himself!

1:13:32.100 --> 1:13:36.100
My darling. Go and take your crown.

1:13:36.100 --> 1:13:39.100
And leave the flintstone here! I’ll keep it for you.

1:13:39.100 --> 1:13:40.100
…how do you…

1:13:40.100 --> 1:13:43.100
You can’t go through this ritual having any objects related to fire!

1:13:43.100 --> 1:13:47.100
Don’t worry, you’ll get it back…

1:13:47.100 --> 1:13:49.100
My king!

1:13:49.100 --> 1:13:51.100
Right after the ritual..

1:13:51.100 --> 1:13:53.100
Why do you want to kill him!?

1:13:53.100 --> 1:13:55.100
Youuu?!

1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:57.100
Kill him?! Ha-ha…

1:13:57.100 --> 1:14:00.100
Potter… she’s luring you into a death trap!

1:13:58.100 --> 1:14:00.100
My darling, look at this ridiculous…

1:14:00.100 --> 1:14:03.100
...blind jealousy!

1:14:02.100 --> 1:14:04.100
Let’s go back

1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:05.100
Apparently, she…

1:14:04.100 --> 1:14:06.100
to the town, to our friends.

1:14:05.100 --> 1:14:07.100
By taking you to the place…

1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:08.100
…where nobody appreciates you.

1:14:08.100 --> 1:14:09.100
The Queen wants to kill you!

1:14:09.100 --> 1:14:11.100
I want everyone to know...

1:14:09.100 --> 1:14:10.100
You must not enter the tower!

1:14:10.100 --> 1:14:14.100
You shouldn’t take her crown!

1:14:11.100 --> 1:14:14.100
what a wonderful person Potter is!

1:14:15.100 --> 1:14:17.100
He doesn’t have to be a king for that!

1:14:17.100 --> 1:14:20.100
The world works in such a way that only power can give

1:14:20.100 --> 1:14:23.100
…Potter what he longs for.

1:14:23.100 --> 1:14:25.100
It’s not true!

1:14:24.100 --> 1:14:26.100
Only when you become the king…

1:14:25.100 --> 1:14:27.100
She is tricking you!

1:14:26.100 --> 1:14:31.100
...you get respect and appreciation of your shining talents.

1:14:27.100 --> 1:14:30.100
Tricking! Do you hear?! Why do you believe her?

1:14:30.100 --> 1:14:31.100
It is not like that!

1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:32.100
Don’t believe her!

1:14:32.100 --> 1:14:34.100
Don’t believe me, Potter. Don’t.

1:14:34.100 --> 1:14:35.100
You do the math.

1:14:35.100 --> 1:14:39.100
Remember, my darling, who you used to be.

1:14:39.100 --> 1:14:42.100
And imagine who you will become!

1:14:41.100 --> 1:14:43.100
Pot-te-e-e-er!

1:14:43.100 --> 1:14:44.100
That’s a li-i-i-ie!

1:14:43.100 --> 1:14:47.100
I just want everyone to admire you!

1:14:47.100 --> 1:14:48.100
Ginger...

1:14:48.100 --> 1:14:50.100
Get out of here, now!

1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:54.100
When I become the king, I’ll take care with you.

1:14:58.100 --> 1:15:03.100
I told you – everyone cares for wealth and power!

1:15:05.100 --> 1:15:06.100
Granny…

1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:14.100
You don't believe me...

1:15:15.100 --> 1:15:17.100
You don’t!

1:15:56.100 --> 1:15:58.100
I don’t understand what’s… What’s going on?
No one understands anything at all here!

1:15:57.100 --> 1:15:58.100
Come on, think!

1:15:58.100 --> 1:15:59.100
I can’t remember!

1:15:59.100 --> 1:16:00.100
Trouble is brewing!

1:16:01.100 --> 1:16:03.100
Try to remember! What’s going to happen?

1:16:02.100 --> 1:16:06.100
Why is our Fireman fussing around?
We must save ourselves!

1:16:06.100 --> 1:16:07.100
I remembered!

1:16:07.100 --> 1:16:08.100
What?

1:16:07.100 --> 1:16:09.100
Otherwise, why is he so worried?!

1:16:08.100 --> 1:16:10.100
I remembered how to play dominoes!

1:16:10.100 --> 1:16:13.100
He isn’t worried… He is panicking!

1:16:13.100 --> 1:16:14.100
That’s it! Dead-end!

1:16:13.300 --> 1:16:15.100
We are doomed, doomed!!!!

1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:21.100
A-ah, it is locked!

1:16:21.300 --> 1:16:26.100
Filaury! What have you done!?

1:16:27.300 --> 1:16:29.100
What is so special about that clumsy girl?

1:16:29.300 --> 1:16:31.100
Everyone’s turned their backs on her.

1:16:31.300 --> 1:16:36.100
The throne is yours! You wanted it so much!

1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:40.100
You will have everything! Everything!

1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:43.100
Just give me the flintstone!

1:16:58.300 --> 1:17:03.100
Okay, okay... run towards your death!

1:17:03.300 --> 1:17:05.100
You may both burn alive!

1:17:05.300 --> 1:17:09.100
And let the whole town burn down!

1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:14.100
Fire! What’s going on!

1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:14.100
Run for your lives!

1:17:13.300 --> 1:17:15.100
Aaah, don’t know!

1:17:16.300 --> 1:17:20.100
The buildings are burning!

1:17:16.300 --> 1:17:18.100
A-a-ah it hurts!

1:17:18.300 --> 1:17:20.100
Help!

1:17:19.300 --> 1:17:21.100
Get out of here! Hurry!

1:17:22.100 --> 1:17:23.100
To purify…

1:17:24.100 --> 1:17:26.100
To purge oneself from… Clean...  No... Yes...!

1:17:27.100 --> 1:17:28.100
No!

1:17:30.100 --> 1:17:34.100
No! No-o-o!

1:17:34.100 --> 1:17:38.100
How very romantic Your Majesty!

1:17:38.100 --> 1:17:42.100
To get burnt with love. Ha-ha-ha-ha…

1:17:45.100 --> 1:17:46.100
That’s it!

1:17:47.100 --> 1:17:48.100
…the end!

1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:53.100
Come on! Yo-heave-ho! Come on!

1:17:54.100 --> 1:17:56.100
That’s it! …We’ve run out of water!

1:17:57.100 --> 1:17:58.100
Get the car to the river… Hurry!

1:17:58.100 --> 1:18:01.100
What did we do to deserve it?

1:18:01.100 --> 1:18:03.100
Ow! Oh my…!

1:18:02.100 --> 1:18:04.100
Everything! Everything will burn down!

1:18:04.100 --> 1:18:05.100
Everything is on fire!

1:18:04.100 --> 1:18:07.100
We’ll be left out in the streets!

1:18:05.100 --> 1:18:07.100
Ouuuh, somebody help! Aaaah…!

1:18:07.100 --> 1:18:09.100
And the castle is burning!

1:18:26.100 --> 1:18:29.100
Ginger… breathe!

1:18:32.100 --> 1:18:33.100
Hold on…

1:18:33.100 --> 1:18:34.100
… hold onto me!

1:18:39.100 --> 1:18:41.100
Rusty, how did you get here?

1:18:46.100 --> 1:18:47.100
I’ll help you!

1:18:51.100 --> 1:18:53.100
Fire behind you!

1:18:52.100 --> 1:18:54.100
We’re all going to die!!!!

1:18:54.100 --> 1:18:56.100
I can’t breathe.

1:18:55.100 --> 1:18:56.100
Get out of at all here!

1:18:56.100 --> 1:18:58.100
Where? The fire is everywhere!

1:18:58.100 --> 1:19:00.100
Come here! Closer!

1:19:05.100 --> 1:19:06.100
Oh! Look, who is there?!

1:19:06.100 --> 1:19:07.100
Ginger?

1:19:07.100 --> 1:19:08.100
Is that Ginger?

1:19:08.100 --> 1:19:10.100
What is she doing there?! That’s her for sure! She’s saving somebody…

1:19:10.100 --> 1:19:11.100
Saving?Us?

1:19:13.100 --> 1:19:15.100
Ginger wants to save us!!!

1:19:15.100 --> 1:19:17.100
Ginger? She’s saving us! Ginger!

1:19:17.100 --> 1:19:18.100
Come on, Ginger!

1:19:18.100 --> 1:19:20.100
Ginger! Atta girl! Come on, Ginger!

1:19:20.100 --> 1:19:22.100
You’re our only hope!!!

1:19:21.100 --> 1:19:30.100
Gin-ger! Gin-ger! Gin-ger!

1:19:53.100 --> 1:19:56.100
Filaury!

1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:14.200
Our Ginger is a tiptopper!

1:20:14.201 --> 1:20:19.999
I always knew that Ginger was a natural rescuer! Everyone knew that!

1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:25.600
Ginger! Our saviour! Thank you…. girl

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:35.100
Aaaaa, firemen! Aaaaa, hurrraaaah! Get the heroes down! Woooah!

1:20:37.995 --> 1:20:41.200
Ohhh! *sobbing*

1:20:41.201 --> 1:20:49.100
*more sobbings*

1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:54.000
Come on! Hurry up! Help me! Yo-heave-ho!

1:20:54.001 --> 1:21:03.000
They saved us, but… poor them... Ginger she was just a girl... Brave... and we her...

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:16.000
Hurrah..! Ha-ha-ha…! There is justice after all! They’re saved!

1:21:16.001 --> 1:21:21.800
Who are they? Potter’s friends! Don’t you recognize them?

1:21:21.801 --> 1:21:30.000
What wedding? We don’t have our tailcoats! Aaah! Nor our heads! Nor invitations...

1:21:30.001 --> 1:21:33.200
I remembered! I remembered!

1:21:33.210 --> 1:21:37.000
I remembered the mystery of the flintstone!

1:21:37.001 --> 1:21:42.000
You may resist its temptation only if you completely deny envy and greed!

1:21:42.001 --> 1:21:50.400
But only a pure soul is capable of that!

1:21:50.410 --> 1:21:54.100
Well, why are you so confused… Go find your new friends!

1:21:54.101 --> 1:21:59.000
That’s what was written on the third sheet...

1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:09.000
I told you - you can raised children!

1:22:12.100 --> 1:22:16.100
We don’t need it any more!

1:22:16.101 --> 1:22:18.100
What are you going to do without your fire?

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.100
You are my fire!

1:22:43.100 --> 1:22:47.100
We try to find our real selves forever in this world.

1:22:47.100 --> 1:22:51.100
We follow different paths.

1:22:51.100 --> 1:22:59.100
We see the light. But what if it’s there for somebody else?

1:22:59.100 --> 1:23:02.100
The dreams seem so far away.

1:23:02.100 --> 1:23:08.100
Stop wasting your time, keep your dream alive, become a drop of light and share your love with others.

1:23:08.100 --> 1:23:10.100
The night will turn Into the day

1:23:10.100 --> 1:23:15.100
And you will understand that love is stronger than any misfortunes!

1:23:15.100 --> 1:23:20.100
Ginger Shared her light and set the hearts aflame

1:23:20.100 --> 1:23:25.100
Filling the world with love and joy.

1:23:25.100 --> 1:23:35.100
Now everyone around smiles a happy smile and lights their own fire!

1:23:45.100 --> 1:23:50.100
Everything is possible in this world;

1:23:50.100 --> 1:23:55.100
Fire tempers your destiny just like clay.

1:23:55.100 --> 1:24:02.100
If you are loved, if you have friends,
You’ll find the strength to give a part of yourself.

1:24:02.100 --> 1:24:05.100
Become as free as wind itself.

1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:10.100
Warm those around with your sunshine.
Embrace and give comfort.

1:24:10.100 --> 1:24:14.100
The night will turn into the day.

1:24:14.100 --> 1:24:18.100
And you will understand that love is stronger than any misfortunes.

1:24:18.100 --> 1:24:22.100
Ginger shared her light
And set the hearts aflame

1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:27.100
Filling the world with love and joy.

1:24:27.100 --> 1:24:32.100
Now everyone around Smiles a happy smile
And lights their own fire!

1:25:03.100 --> 1:25:05.100
Good morning.

1:25:06.100 --> 1:25:09.100
Hello. Who…are you?

1:25:09.100 --> 1:25:12.100
And.. who am I?

1:25:12.100 --> 1:25:15.100
It’s a long story, but I’ll tell it to you...

1:25:15.100 --> 1:25:21.100
because we’ve got plenty of time

1:25:21.100 --> 1:25:24.100
Yummy. What is your name?

1:25:24.100 --> 1:25:28.100
Ulrich Percival Systematus!

1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:31.100
Nice name! But very long.

1:25:31.100 --> 1:25:35.100
I love long names.
