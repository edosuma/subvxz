WEBVTT

00:06.172 --> 00:10.040
Everybody dies.
I'm told that's just the way it is.

00:10.176 --> 00:13.592
I'm told I'm not supposed to argue
or question or even try to understand.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.715
I'm told a lot these days.

00:16.850 --> 00:20.349
Ever since my life was snuffed out
by a toilet seat

00:20.478 --> 00:23.396
and I joined the ranks of the undead.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.728
This is Rube. He's undead too.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.815
He gets the list,
who's to die, when and where,

00:30.947 --> 00:34.067
which he passes on
to the rest of us grim reapers.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.949
- This is what we look like to the living.
- Holy shit.

00:38.079 --> 00:42.124
My name is George Lass.
I take souls.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.785
This was my home,
and this was my family.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.921
Dad, Reggie, Mom.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.966
They're having trouble coping.

00:52.093 --> 00:55.711
Do you guys get off
dropping pianos on people?

00:55.847 --> 00:58.634
It's not our job to drop the pianos.

00:58.767 --> 01:01.055
Whose job is it?

01:01.186 --> 01:05.230
Gravelings. They set things in motion,
make the accidents happen.

01:05.357 --> 01:10.018
- They kill people?
- Life and death have to exist in harmony.

01:10.820 --> 01:14.320
- That balance has to be maintained.
- Or else?

01:14.449 --> 01:17.652
Things get out of hand,
and that ain't pretty.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.603
Long and gnarled
is the fickle finger of fate,

02:27.731 --> 02:30.850
but that finger
has a pisser of a hangnail.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.901
It can be crippling,
and in the game of life and death,

02:34.029 --> 02:36.187
it's good that fate has a weakness,

02:36.322 --> 02:40.320
like the candy-coated goodness
of a lightly salted Peanut Poppy.

02:40.452 --> 02:45.197
For those not raised in the South,
a Peanut Poppy is like a peanut M&M,

02:45.331 --> 02:47.704
but just different enough
to avoid litigation.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.752
And the purple ones are the best.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.711
From the fields of Georgia
to a factory processing unit

02:54.841 --> 02:56.750
to a store near you...

02:58.386 --> 03:02.514
.. something as insignificant
as a Peanut Poppy can change fate.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.050
I kind of prefer M&M's.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.937
I like these. These are salted.

03:09.064 --> 03:12.183
I think I'd like them better
if they weren't.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.941
I mean, they're good but...

03:17.530 --> 03:19.606
Go buy yourself some M&M's.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.282
I wish she had a tail.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.163
If it was wagging, I'd know she liked me.

03:26.289 --> 03:31.200
I'm gonna eat a Listerine strip.
These make your breath smell like ass.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.412
Ass and peanuts.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.928
Dammit.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.179
- My guy's a no-show.
- Were you on time?

03:46.309 --> 03:48.218
For the time you gave me.

03:48.353 --> 03:53.644
So does this mean a soul is gonna rot now?
He had an appointment.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.566
- He missed it.
- So?

03:55.694 --> 03:57.567
So buttons. Don't you listen?

03:57.696 --> 04:01.195
Somebody doesn't show up,
the appointment gets cancelled.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.361
- It's rare but it happens.
- So he gets to live?

04:04.494 --> 04:08.278
- Consequence-free?
- Till his appointment's rescheduled.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.534
You said you can't reschedule.
You can't change fate.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.206
Cardinal rule - everybody dies.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.208
Every so often
things don't go as planned.

04:17.339 --> 04:22.714
So on a whim he goes to pick up doughnuts
for the office and he gets to live?

04:22.846 --> 04:24.803
Sounds like instant karma.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.683
No one mentioned death had a loophole.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.683
That's really fucking unfair.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.977
You like the ladies, right?

04:35.233 --> 04:37.558
Sure you do.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.521
You and me, hop and pop?
Clearwater casino, north of the border?

04:42.657 --> 04:46.986
- Drive up, fly back. What do you say?
- I'm easy.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.037
Actually, I know some mates
in Clearwater.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.457
Here. You might wanna ask for a late lunch.

04:55.253 --> 04:59.880
- Where's Betty?
- Incapacitated. She's working on it.

05:01.176 --> 05:04.960
Hello! There's been a mistake!

05:10.226 --> 05:15.813
Fate isn't always fickle.
Sometimes it sticks to what it knows.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.767
Thanks for the ride, Joy.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.649
I asked you not to call me that.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.069
It's your name.
Don't you like your name?

05:26.201 --> 05:31.906
It's fine, but you don't need to say it
unless someone asks you what it is, got it?

05:32.957 --> 05:37.204
You might want to nod or something
to acknowledge that I've spoken.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.254
- Thank you.
- Now can I go?

05:42.425 --> 05:44.418
Yes.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.309
It was like watching
reruns of my childhood.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.885
I knew almost nothing about my sister.

05:57.148 --> 06:01.312
I'm not even really sure
what grade she's in. Fifth, I think.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.734
Help!

06:06.449 --> 06:09.201
- Hey, Lassie.
- Lass-hole.

06:12.914 --> 06:18.121
How could someone so invisible to me
be so visible to everyone else?

06:22.048 --> 06:23.079
Gross!

06:23.216 --> 06:27.428
Maybe because she acted
like the princess of weird.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.850
I sense you're not challenged.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.654
Are you challenged, Millie?

06:47.032 --> 06:48.858
Sort of.

06:48.992 --> 06:53.535
Cold and flu season is almost upon us.
We're about to get very busy.

06:53.663 --> 06:58.788
How would you feel about having
a weensy bit more responsibility?

07:00.503 --> 07:01.535
Uh...

07:01.671 --> 07:04.341
- OK.
- That's the spirit.

07:04.466 --> 07:08.878
United Insurance is looking for
a filer with a positive attitude.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.847
This is regarded
as a low-interest position,

07:11.973 --> 07:14.132
so our options will be limited.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.805
I'd like you to compile a list

07:16.936 --> 07:21.314
of remedial-skill avails for me
and prioritise them.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.892
- In what order?
- Start with people who are best suited

07:25.028 --> 07:27.435
and work your way down to the dregs.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.063
Isn't responsibility fun?

07:33.495 --> 07:37.113
As I worked through the dregs,

07:37.248 --> 07:40.166
I couldn't help but ponder
the day I died.

07:44.339 --> 07:48.253
What if I stayed in the office
for my 35-minute lunch hour?

07:48.385 --> 07:53.047
What if I ate in the break room?
What if I missed my appointment?

07:53.181 --> 07:55.802
What if it really was unfair?

07:55.934 --> 07:59.469
I may not have been able
to save my life,

07:59.604 --> 08:02.973
but that didn't mean
I couldn't save somebody else's.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.022
- Hi.
- Hi. Um...

08:09.155 --> 08:13.734
My gynaecologist called
and he needs to reschedule a little early,

08:13.868 --> 08:16.075
so if that's possible...

08:16.204 --> 08:18.825
He just can't make up his mind, can he?

08:18.957 --> 08:23.702
- Yeah. So is that OK?
- Of course, don't be silly.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.078
I hope it's nothing serious.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.797
No, no. I'm fine. It's just...

08:29.926 --> 08:32.417
- I'm fine.
- Is it a...

08:34.639 --> 08:36.881
What?

08:37.017 --> 08:39.258
Are they doing a...?

08:39.394 --> 08:41.136
Oh, uh-huh...

08:41.270 --> 08:44.971
- Whatever it is, early detection is key.
- Yeah.

08:45.108 --> 08:49.770
Last time I had a Pap,
my ass stuck to the paper,

08:49.904 --> 08:54.068
so when my ob-gyn told me
to slide down, the paper ripped.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.993
He kept trying to pull more paper up
from that little roll under the table

08:59.122 --> 09:04.199
and tuck it around my head,
but that kept falling off too.

09:04.336 --> 09:07.040
I tell you, we got to laughing.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.338
I was laughing so hard
he couldn't get the speculum in

09:10.467 --> 09:15.294
because my muscles were all tense,
because of the laughing.

09:15.430 --> 09:19.428
You know, I think that was
one of my best laughs ever.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.351
- You got 14. Dealer has 16. Hit or stick?
- Don't know.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.522
- Why aren't you watching the table?
- Don't know.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.402
You hit. Somehow, the guy next to you busts.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.693
Do I like this guy?

09:38.828 --> 09:40.868
He's your fellow man. Of course.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.449
You took his card.
He doesn't wanna be your friend.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.083
- He's crying into his beer.
- Then I would stick.

09:48.213 --> 09:51.130
Someone can blow it for the whole table.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.792
- So don't let her sit at the table.
- She's already sitting.

09:54.928 --> 09:59.139
- Don't get excited.
- I'm not excited. What are you talking about?

09:59.265 --> 10:03.394
You probably should have
this conversation with George.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.011
- Why you doing this to me?
- What?

10:07.691 --> 10:09.434
- Nothing.
- I'm not doing anything.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.485
- Just take a breath.
- I'm breathing fine, Mason.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.103
Good. If you want, I'll talk to her.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.320
I don't want you talking to anybody.
I'm sorry I brought it up.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.860
- Don't be sorry.
- It was a mistake.

10:21.996 --> 10:25.864
- We were having a chat.
- I should say it to George.

10:26.001 --> 10:29.037
- We didn't have this conversation.
- What conversation did we have?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.661
Who gives a shit? Not this one.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.886
Gary, I thought
you came in here to exercise.

10:38.013 --> 10:40.219
- I did.
- What happened?

10:40.348 --> 10:42.092
Nothing. I'm exercising.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.426
What are you talking about?

10:45.562 --> 10:49.559
I found a way to work out
and read at the same time.

10:49.691 --> 10:54.269
I do that every day, Gary.
You see our treadmill has a book stand.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.773
Can you cook and work out
at the same time? Or drive?

10:57.907 --> 11:02.154
- Of course not.
- Well, now you can.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.404
- What is that?
- A miracle.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.919
No more crunches, no more sit-ups.

11:10.045 --> 11:13.663
All I have to do
is simply turn it and burn it.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.883
All you have to do
for your Absolver is send...

11:18.011 --> 11:21.759
I found PJ Monroe
11 minutes before his ETD,

11:21.890 --> 11:25.425
almost two miles
from where he was scheduled to die.

11:25.560 --> 11:30.471
- I'm sorry. Mr Monroe isn't available.
- Did you tell him it's important?

11:30.607 --> 11:33.643
- He's on his way out.
- It'll only take a second.

11:33.777 --> 11:37.027
He's not gonna see you.
He doesn't know who you are.

11:38.198 --> 11:43.275
I'm the girl his son drugged,
and it's regarding him video-taping me

11:43.411 --> 11:47.575
while homeless people had sex
with my unconscious body.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.914
I'll double-check.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.997
A stream of lies
spewed from my mouth,

11:53.129 --> 11:55.703
each one more elaborate than the last.

11:55.840 --> 12:00.218
I drew on everything I ever read in
Penthouse Forum and made it my own.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.429
I was queen of deception,
and I was on fire.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.175
By the time I finished,
I almost believed it myself.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.884
.. woke up someplace else.

12:10.021 --> 12:15.360
You don't show up
for your appointment, it gets cancelled.

12:16.194 --> 12:20.061
- Cancel my two o'clock.
- Rare, but it happens.

12:20.198 --> 12:23.863
I would like to give you... some money.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.698
And instant karma to boot.

12:29.332 --> 12:35.536
PJ Monroe should be running a red light
to make his two o'clock, but he's not.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.839
Excuse me. I am so sorry.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.754
My sister's card.
Call her. She's a lawyer.

12:41.886 --> 12:45.801
She will crucify
that little son of a bitch.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.008
- Thanks.
- OK.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.603
Mason and Rube had popped
the busload of gamblers

12:52.731 --> 12:55.103
and were flying home standby.

13:06.369 --> 13:09.619
- Where are you going?
- To kill that fucking baby.

13:10.331 --> 13:15.871
I'm just kidding. I love babies.
I gotta make a sissy. Back in two shakes.

13:37.776 --> 13:42.484
But tempting fate
is another issue altogether,

13:44.282 --> 13:49.193
especially when you're supplementing
your income smuggling drugs up your ass.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.347
While Rube was being fickle-fingered,

14:12.477 --> 14:16.142
I was returning to Happy Time
with a click in my heel.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.641
I was strong. I was invincible.

14:19.776 --> 14:25.197
I beat the system, righted a universal wrong,
but what about the variables?

14:26.574 --> 14:30.738
Not even Herbig, who sanitises herself
to the point of pathology,

14:30.870 --> 14:34.204
can account for all the variables.

14:34.332 --> 14:39.575
These are the remedial-skills avails
that Delores asked for.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.583
I'll just leave 'em on her chair.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.428
I was just writing you a note.
How'd it go?

14:55.562 --> 15:00.058
- How did what go?
- The... Pap.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.223
Oh.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.313
Fine, fine. It's all good.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.949
- I was just...
- When d'you get the results?

15:08.950 --> 15:10.777
Um... Uh...

15:10.910 --> 15:13.947
- A couple of days.
- That's quick.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.449
By the time I get my results,
I forget I've had the test.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.750
- I hope they don't make you repeat it.
- They won't.

15:20.879 --> 15:24.793
They will if it's abnormal.
Listen, I left you a Bowes catalogue.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.047
Your workspace is a little sparse.

15:27.177 --> 15:31.637
Why don't you get yourself a blotter
and one of those jelly wrist supports?

15:31.765 --> 15:33.841
OK.

15:41.107 --> 15:45.401
Pull your pants down around your ankles
and bend over, please.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.854
OK.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.036
I was kidding about the baby.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.452
You want me to say sorry?
I'll say I'm sorry.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.753
It's every Saturday for ten weeks.

16:04.881 --> 16:08.464
I thought it might be something fun
we could do together.

16:08.593 --> 16:12.507
- I have yoga on Saturdays.
- Well, you could do both.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.473
What do they make you do?

16:19.020 --> 16:21.938
Undies too, sir.

16:30.532 --> 16:33.486
It's a pottery class. You make pottery.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.694
What kind?

16:35.829 --> 16:38.367
Coffee mugs, bowls.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.997
Can't you just buy those at the store?

16:43.128 --> 16:45.085
Would you prefer to paint?

16:45.213 --> 16:48.131
I'm gonna have to ask you
to lean into me.

16:58.435 --> 17:03.013
Just a kind of general apology?
To whom it may concern?

17:03.148 --> 17:05.603
He's clean.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.651
Put your clothes back on.
You're free to go.

17:15.326 --> 17:16.489
Thanks.

17:20.498 --> 17:23.250
I'm gonna pretend this didn't happen.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.122
I think something just broke.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.758
I'm gonna kill that fucking baby.

17:39.100 --> 17:41.805
You're very well liked here.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.012
- I am?
- Absolutely!

17:44.147 --> 17:47.267
I've never seen someone
find their place so quickly.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.689
It really feels like you're one of us.

17:49.819 --> 17:55.655
But this part-time business,
it just isn't working out for you.

17:55.784 --> 17:59.733
I'd like you one more day a week.
What do you say?

17:59.871 --> 18:01.365
Uh, what day?

18:01.498 --> 18:04.997
Tuesday, so we get you Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.585
OK.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.463
Somehow I was failing upward.

18:09.589 --> 18:12.756
Wonderful! That makes me very happy.

18:12.884 --> 18:15.719
I stood out because
I was the only one standing.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.132
Delores Herbig.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.641
Why, hello, Sandra Sherman.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.097
Thank you so much for returning my call.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.444
Yes, yes, I do. Are you still available?

18:32.987 --> 18:37.032
Wonderful! You just made my day.

18:37.158 --> 18:42.401
Have Crystal call Deloitte & Touche
and say we got that executive assistant.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.077
Sandra!

18:45.917 --> 18:50.413
She had her little secret,
and that secret was safe with me.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.832
For all I know, it was her cosmic role
to spread disease,

18:53.967 --> 18:56.884
and for all she knew, I was the enemy.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.755
Um...

18:58.888 --> 19:01.842
Delores asked me to ask you to...

19:01.975 --> 19:06.720
I couldn't bring myself to give her an order,
even if it was from someone else.

19:06.855 --> 19:10.140
.. for the number
to the lady at Deloitte & Touche.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.819
Thanks.

19:23.455 --> 19:28.580
And just so you know, I won't tell
anyone about what you did, OK?

19:30.420 --> 19:32.247
What did I do?

19:32.380 --> 19:35.915
Even after thwarting fate itself...

19:36.051 --> 19:37.711
Nothing.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.631
.. Crystal still intimidated
the shit out of me.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.922
Never mind.

20:02.577 --> 20:05.613
- Hi.
- I just got off the phone with Marilyn.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.997
You're making friends
all over the place, aren't you?

20:09.125 --> 20:11.082
Good.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.247
But I said I wanted Crystal
to make that call.

20:14.381 --> 20:18.378
I couldn't say
Crystal scared the shit out of me, so I said:

20:18.510 --> 20:23.006
She seemed really busy
and I didn't wanna bother her.

20:23.139 --> 20:27.635
Crystal was busy? I'm sorry.
Were you about to use the phone?

20:27.769 --> 20:33.475
I was just calling you to see
if there was anything I could do to help.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.894
I became aware of the words
after they left my mouth.

20:37.028 --> 20:41.275
I like the way you show initiative,
Millie. I like it a lot.

20:41.408 --> 20:45.820
I'd better watch my back.
Pretty soon you'll have my job.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.279
Only after you get a promotion.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.741
I felt dirty.

20:51.876 --> 20:55.495
Well, keep up the good work,
and thank you.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.121
You're welcome.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.963
You could learn a thing or two
from that girl.

21:08.643 --> 21:11.395
Everybody's on the clock tonight.

21:11.521 --> 21:16.432
I think I should probably bow out.
I'm feeling unwell and a bit stopped up.

21:16.568 --> 21:20.103
That's not an option.
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

21:20.238 --> 21:24.236
- These are right next to each other.
- Is a balcony gonna collapse?

21:24.367 --> 21:28.032
- Some don't even have times.
- You got an eight-hour window.

21:28.163 --> 21:31.413
It's all a bit of a hiccup.
Nobody expects perfection.

21:31.541 --> 21:35.705
- Is there gonna be an earthquake?
- A bus of ladies going over a cliff?

21:35.837 --> 21:37.462
I know just the one.

21:37.589 --> 21:42.049
It seemed like a good time
to slip in under the radar.

21:42.177 --> 21:45.759
I forgot to tell you,
my last guy didn't show up.

21:47.390 --> 21:51.055
Just thought you might wanna know.
What's the soup today?

21:51.186 --> 21:53.013
Cream of bullshit.

21:55.023 --> 21:59.270
I stood at the intersection
for like an hour and nothing happened.

21:59.402 --> 22:03.067
Pretend a few days have gone by
and you rethought this lie.

22:03.198 --> 22:06.448
You're sad, repentant,
because you had an epiphany.

22:06.576 --> 22:09.447
I'm not lying.

22:10.288 --> 22:12.957
- Jesus!
- Peanut, people lie all the time.

22:13.083 --> 22:15.538
- It's not a bad thing.
- Sweet Jesus!

22:15.669 --> 22:19.500
You're just misguided. How's about
trying some honesty out for size?

22:19.631 --> 22:24.127
I can't seem to make my fingers
work. A little help here, please?

22:24.260 --> 22:29.468
- What have you got to say for yourself?
- Help me. Help me. Jesus.

22:29.599 --> 22:31.343
I'm not lying.

22:31.476 --> 22:36.352
If a lie is big enough,
there's a need to protect it.

22:36.481 --> 22:39.980
- It's almost maternal.
- Thank you, Jesus.

22:40.944 --> 22:45.191
I could only pray
there wasn't any surveillance footage

22:45.323 --> 22:48.775
linking me to PJ Monroe
and his non-death.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.366
I can't get this.

22:51.496 --> 22:57.202
I planned to call as
little attention to myself as possible.

22:59.504 --> 23:04.747
It landed on my wank.
My wank is the key.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.636
That was the plan anyway.

23:07.762 --> 23:10.882
- Have you thought about having a wank?
- No.

23:11.891 --> 23:15.058
I saw a dirty movie
about a girl who had a wank.

23:15.186 --> 23:19.647
- She looked like a boy with fake tits.
- Will you please stop talking?

23:39.461 --> 23:42.082
Athletic supplier Monroco

23:42.213 --> 23:46.875
issued a massive recall
of their latest product Absolver.

23:47.010 --> 23:49.715
I want to say that
the Monroe corporation

23:49.846 --> 23:53.262
is deeply troubled by the loss of life.

23:53.391 --> 23:57.603
It slowly dawned on me
that I may have made a mistake.

23:57.729 --> 24:00.730
I didn't know
PJ Monroe was contemplating

24:00.857 --> 24:05.069
the latest risk-assessment warning
from Legal when I paid him a visit.

24:05.195 --> 24:10.236
I didn't know he was surprised to learn,
after months of exhaustive testing,

24:10.367 --> 24:14.364
Product Safety had determined
that people who exercise sweat.

24:14.496 --> 24:19.490
I didn't know that sweat when combined
with an un-ground electrical current

24:19.626 --> 24:24.122
could result in what the boys in the lab
nickname a belly fire.

24:24.255 --> 24:30.175
But I did know PJ Monroe was distracted
and not thinking clearly that day.

24:31.638 --> 24:36.099
The potential dangers of the Absolver
were somehow far from his mind.

24:36.226 --> 24:39.891
You're not my son! I didn't teach you
to treat women that way.

24:40.021 --> 24:44.730
What the hell's the matter with you?
Are you insane? I'll kill you!

24:44.859 --> 24:51.028
I don't think this is what Delores
had in mind when she said responsibility is fun.

24:51.157 --> 24:55.155
May I have your attention, please?

24:55.286 --> 24:57.362
Rube was tap-dancing

24:57.497 --> 25:00.866
about an after-life fuck-up
with the Absolver souls.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.373
.. a little off guard today.

25:03.503 --> 25:08.710
There's just a bit of a backlog
and I appreciate your patience.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.927
I apologise.

25:18.059 --> 25:21.594
This is just terribly embarrassing.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.806
Look...

25:25.525 --> 25:29.653
Before you go anywhere, I'm gonna
give you the name of somebody

25:29.779 --> 25:33.231
whose magic just does wonders.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.442
You'll be happy.

25:38.079 --> 25:40.784
I wanna thank you for understanding.

26:02.479 --> 26:06.975
I had this one dude and he had
these electrical belts all over his body.

26:07.108 --> 26:11.402
He looked like the Bionic Man,
Bionic Woman, Six Million Dollar Man,

26:11.529 --> 26:13.273
whatever that shit is.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.980
I don't why these people do this.

26:16.117 --> 26:20.863
You know that lady on Three's Company
with the big titties? I did her thing.

26:20.997 --> 26:25.992
Her butt-blaster, ass-master... Whatever.
Anyway, I looked ridiculous.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.297
Are you high?

26:33.468 --> 26:35.959
I've got illegals in my bottom.

26:36.805 --> 26:40.423
- Why do you do this to yourself?
- I don't know.

26:47.357 --> 26:49.396
You're taking this awfully hard.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.902
I just feel... really bad

26:54.030 --> 26:59.903
about all the people
that had to die... accidentally.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.823
Is that it? I thought
maybe you saw the news

27:02.956 --> 27:07.203
and were feeling shitty
about what you did.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.624
Pulled the wrong piece out.

27:09.754 --> 27:14.048
A hiccup is when something happens
that's not supposed to happen.

27:14.175 --> 27:19.170
The system has to figure out
what that something is and fix it.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.556
- PJ Monroe.
- I'm sorry.

27:22.684 --> 27:26.812
What'd you do?
Slash his tyres, have him arrested?

27:26.938 --> 27:29.180
I just talked to him.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.474
Must have been some conversation.

27:31.609 --> 27:34.397
- I guess.
- I hope it was worth it.

27:34.529 --> 27:37.067
- You got the hots for the guy?
- No!

27:37.198 --> 27:40.033
- Did he give you some money?
- No!

27:40.160 --> 27:42.651
Help me out.

27:43.329 --> 27:46.781
I just wanted to see if I could do it.

27:46.916 --> 27:51.377
I need somebody to give me lessons
on how to communicate with you, peanut,

27:51.504 --> 27:53.580
'cause I'm at a loss.

27:53.715 --> 27:57.298
The coin's in the slot
and the gumball's on its way

27:57.427 --> 28:00.344
and I'm plumb out of wisdom.

28:00.472 --> 28:02.844
I'd start sleeping with the lights on.

28:02.974 --> 28:06.924
I didn't know
if that was a threat or a warning.

28:07.562 --> 28:12.769
Rube washed his hands of me,
but that didn't mean I was off the hook.

28:12.901 --> 28:16.436
It only got worse. I broke the rules.

28:16.571 --> 28:20.438
The gravelings declared
hunting season on my ass.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.719
Ow!

28:45.308 --> 28:49.258
Rube was only responsible for us
up to a point.

28:56.945 --> 29:00.029
No, no, no.
Do I look like I own rubber sheets?

29:00.156 --> 29:02.232
You're sleeping on the floor.

29:02.367 --> 29:06.412
- You're not making me sleep on the floor?
- Sure I am.

29:06.538 --> 29:08.993
Let me get a pillow.

29:09.124 --> 29:13.501
It's a nice pillow. Sleep tight.

29:13.628 --> 29:18.871
It was sad to realise he'd have
my back, if I hadn't already turned it on him.

29:19.009 --> 29:24.347
I'm putting a pan next to your head for
throw-up. It's right next to your head.

29:36.109 --> 29:40.687
The burden of spreading disease
didn't rest solely on Crystal's shoulders.

29:42.449 --> 29:46.281
After all, there's lots of ways
to spread disease.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.596
For Christ's sake!

31:03.113 --> 31:04.144
Ow!

31:04.280 --> 31:06.736
Fucker! Shit!

31:08.159 --> 31:11.824
I didn't know you used
that kind of language, Millie.

31:12.664 --> 31:16.662
I don't. It just really hurt.

31:16.793 --> 31:20.458
Well, it's a very aggressive word.

31:20.588 --> 31:23.079
I know. It's just...

31:24.009 --> 31:28.967
I won't say it again. I'm sorry.
Do you see how red it is?

31:29.097 --> 31:31.802
Maybe you'd better get some ice on that.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.430
All around me
the bridges were burning.

31:37.522 --> 31:41.520
I feel like I've been poisoned.
Have you been poisoned?

31:41.651 --> 31:45.150
No, not on purpose.
I had some bad salmon once.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.446
- I don't touch it any more.
- Was it salmon mousse?

31:48.575 --> 31:51.326
I don't know. It was canned.

31:51.453 --> 31:53.529
- Morning.
- Morning.

31:55.206 --> 31:58.540
- Why are you leaving?
- You'll put me in a bad mood.

31:58.668 --> 32:01.586
And I don't wanna be in a bad mood.

32:01.713 --> 32:04.334
- Do you not like me?
- Not right this minute.

32:04.466 --> 32:07.039
You're a constipator.
You disturb my shit.

32:07.177 --> 32:10.296
I think you're marvellous.

32:10.430 --> 32:12.719
This is not your role model.

32:12.849 --> 32:15.803
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm really sorry.

32:15.935 --> 32:20.597
You'll be sorry till I forgive you
or till you stop doing stupid things.

32:20.732 --> 32:23.223
- You never tried to save anybody?
- No.

32:23.360 --> 32:26.563
- Have you?
- I need to be unconscious.

32:26.696 --> 32:29.863
I know I piss you off,
but you piss me off too.

32:29.991 --> 32:33.443
- I piss you off?
- You accept everything the way it is.

32:33.578 --> 32:36.365
- Why don't you ask questions?
- I'm not curious.

32:36.498 --> 32:40.495
If you don't get this right,
someone'll drop a toilet seat on you.

32:40.627 --> 32:43.296
Give this to Roxy when she shows up.

32:44.422 --> 32:46.166
Here. I got something.

32:48.426 --> 32:51.961
Buy yourself a waffle. Cherry on top.

32:56.351 --> 32:58.723
Do you think I'm a constipator?

32:58.853 --> 33:03.017
Heed his advice and stay
on his good side. He's like a volcano.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.308
He erupts and he spews lava,

33:05.443 --> 33:09.607
and all the little villagers,
they run around for their lives.

33:10.990 --> 33:15.534
But he stops and you can go back
to the safety of your own home.

33:15.662 --> 33:18.449
How long is he gonna stay mad?

33:20.375 --> 33:22.948
I've seen him stay mad for years.

33:23.086 --> 33:26.336
I've seen it,
but not like this, pit-bull mad.

33:26.464 --> 33:31.043
It's like this disturbing,
simmering, quiet rage mad.

33:33.013 --> 33:36.547
But he likes you, George.
He'll stay mad for less time.

33:36.683 --> 33:38.722
Days? Weeks?

33:38.852 --> 33:42.185
- What's the other one, after that one?
- Months?

33:42.313 --> 33:44.390
That's the one.

33:53.366 --> 33:56.616
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:57.328 --> 34:01.029
- Why aren't you at work?
- Called in sick. Come in.

34:01.166 --> 34:04.001
- I have to wash my hands.
- No, you don't.

34:04.127 --> 34:08.670
- I have dirt under my fingernails.
- You're not fooling anyone. Sit down.

34:21.895 --> 34:24.600
What's with that bird, Reggie?

34:26.107 --> 34:29.440
- You didn't kill it, did you?
- I found it like that.

34:29.569 --> 34:32.605
Any other dead animals here
I should know about?

34:32.739 --> 34:34.233
No.

34:34.366 --> 34:38.612
Keeping a dead animal in your toy box
is something a crazy person does.

34:38.745 --> 34:42.445
- I'm not crazy.
- Garbage man wouldn't even take it.

34:42.581 --> 34:45.784
I had to call Animal Control
and the health department

34:45.918 --> 34:48.373
before someone would pick it up.

34:48.505 --> 34:51.623
What do you want me to do about it?

34:51.757 --> 34:54.248
I don't like where we're headed.

34:55.804 --> 34:58.259
I don't...

34:58.390 --> 35:01.509
I hate it so much.

35:06.106 --> 35:09.356
I love you, Reggie.

35:09.484 --> 35:14.063
Every time I talk to you,
I feel like we're little rats in a cage,

35:14.197 --> 35:17.613
and we keep touching that goddamn bar,

35:17.742 --> 35:19.949
and we keep getting shocked.

35:20.078 --> 35:24.740
We don't... effing learn.

35:27.544 --> 35:30.035
Doesn't it make you tired?

35:32.674 --> 35:34.797
'Cause I'm tired.

35:56.072 --> 35:58.859
You missed me, motherfucker!

36:00.785 --> 36:04.653
- Did you see that thing fall down?
- You have a flat tyre.

36:04.789 --> 36:08.739
I walked out my truck, the shit fell down.
May I have some juice?

36:08.877 --> 36:14.417
These brats egged my car.
Then this bitch comes up to me. $25 ticket.

36:14.549 --> 36:17.799
So? Pay the damn ticket.
It's been a fucked-up week.

36:17.927 --> 36:21.972
In that moment,
I understood Roxy more than ever before.

36:22.098 --> 36:25.052
A piece of the puzzle
had fallen into place.

36:25.185 --> 36:30.262
It was like finding out someone's
parents are psychiatrists or Catholic.

36:31.399 --> 36:34.436
Roxy had an even shittier job than me.

36:34.569 --> 36:37.523
I don't know how she put up with it.

36:43.036 --> 36:45.657
I didn't know
JH Arnold was the sunshine

36:45.789 --> 36:48.327
after a long dark night of assholes.

36:51.419 --> 36:56.662
I didn't know he greeted his ticket
with a smile and said, "You got me."

36:56.800 --> 36:59.836
I didn't know
he shared his favourite candy,

36:59.969 --> 37:02.377
the candy his silver-haired mother

37:02.514 --> 37:05.598
shipped to him special
on birthdays and holidays.

37:05.725 --> 37:08.928
And I didn't know
she got his name on a Post-it

37:09.062 --> 37:13.771
almost a year to the day
after their brief but fateful meeting.

37:17.821 --> 37:22.281
But I do know there was something
about him she thought was worth saving,

37:23.159 --> 37:25.650
because she changed his fate.

37:29.958 --> 37:33.374
I don't know how, but she did.

37:36.297 --> 37:40.959
They made her breath smell like ass,
but the Peanut Poppies won her over.

37:41.094 --> 37:44.878
She'd never admit it,
so there was no point in asking.

37:45.015 --> 37:48.549
I saw the words coming out.
I didn't understand a word.

37:49.686 --> 37:52.556
- You got a flat tyre.
- I heard you.

37:52.689 --> 37:55.180
Is one of those mine? Thank you.

37:57.610 --> 38:02.605
So I bought Crystal a present,
a shoe gift-wrapped in dog turd.

38:07.162 --> 38:10.910
I'd been bitch-slapped by fate.

38:11.833 --> 38:14.538
But does that make me fate's bitch?

38:28.725 --> 38:32.473
They say if you mess with the bull,
you get the horns,

38:32.604 --> 38:35.391
but what if the bull hung the cape over you

38:35.523 --> 38:37.812
and said red was your colour?

38:40.862 --> 38:43.531
I could easily replace the light bulb,

38:43.656 --> 38:47.191
but the smell of dog shit under her desk
was gonna linger.

38:47.327 --> 38:51.538
Whether it be wrestling with fate
or engaging in the art of war,

38:51.664 --> 38:54.535
sometimes a ceasefire is necessary.

38:55.543 --> 39:00.751
After a long protracted battle,
was I finally forging an ally?

39:01.675 --> 39:04.545
Maybe fate doesn't always
have the last word.

39:04.678 --> 39:07.429
Maybe fate doesn't want the last word.

39:07.555 --> 39:12.182
The first step in taxidermy
is to have your wires measured and cut.

39:12.310 --> 39:14.635
One of you needs to hold the specimen.

39:14.771 --> 39:17.642
Pull the tips of the wings
to full extension,

39:17.774 --> 39:22.352
while your partner threads the wire
between the bone and the feathers,

39:22.487 --> 39:27.066
starting with the scapulars
and into the contoured feathers.

39:27.200 --> 39:32.989
Your feather work and attention to detail
is what makes your mount look... alive.

40:28.386 --> 40:32.965
Penne with mushrooms,
northern Italian style,

40:33.099 --> 40:36.468
pinch of tarragon, light on the oil.

40:36.603 --> 40:41.348
Touch of vermouth. I use Aqua di Via.

40:41.483 --> 40:43.689
Extra dry.

40:43.818 --> 40:46.309
Not that cheap domestic crap.

42:07.277 --> 42:09.353
