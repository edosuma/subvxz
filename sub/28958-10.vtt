WEBVTT

00:00.015 --> 00:00.843
<i>My name is Talon.</i>

00:01.000 --> 00:03.623
<i>I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.</i>

00:03.711 --> 00:06.234
<i>I escaped when Everit Dred
killed all my people.</i>

00:06.322 --> 00:09.101
<i>I cut off the points of my ears
to hide in plain sight.</i>

00:09.189 --> 00:11.265
<i>A tiny creature
lives inside me,</i>

00:11.437 --> 00:13.296
<i>passed to me
by my dying mother.</i>

00:13.384 --> 00:16.203
<i>It gives me the power
to open portals to another world</i>

00:16.291 --> 00:18.664
<i>and summon powerful demons
called Lu-Qiri.</i>

00:18.838 --> 00:21.247
<i>But I can only summon them
when I have their names,</i>

00:21.414 --> 00:23.250
<i>something that's proving
to be a challenge.</i>

00:23.338 --> 00:26.023
<i>The Prime Order wants me
dead, but I've found sanctuary</i>

00:26.111 --> 00:29.515
<i>at the farthest edge of the Realm
in a place known as the Outpost.</i>

00:29.632 --> 00:31.357
<i>Previously, on</i>
"The Outpost"...

00:31.445 --> 00:33.677
Do you know what I had seen
under her armoire?

00:33.765 --> 00:36.351
The real Rosmund
had a misshapen face.

00:36.439 --> 00:39.573
Admit the truth.
You are no queen.

00:39.704 --> 00:42.076
I was promised all your lands
because you'd be king.

00:42.164 --> 00:43.630
That deal is off the table
for now.

00:43.718 --> 00:44.773
There will be a reckoning.

00:44.861 --> 00:46.016
You're not coming
with me, are you?

00:46.103 --> 00:48.078
You know I can't.
I think it's a key

00:48.166 --> 00:49.872
that belongs to a shrine
called Vor-Anden.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.951
I have 3,000 fighting men.

00:52.039 --> 00:54.607
Your untrained army of boys
doesn't stand a chance.

00:54.695 --> 00:56.013
He's planning
on starving us out.

00:56.101 --> 00:57.656
- Are you still selling?
- Aye.

00:57.744 --> 00:59.671
How are you going to
get me the colipsum?

00:59.759 --> 01:02.370
From the Mistress. - Have you
been taking this every day, Garret?

01:02.853 --> 01:05.084
No! No! I need that!

01:05.173 --> 01:07.718
You've never touched a
Blackblood man at all, have you?

01:07.960 --> 01:09.765
- What's it doing?
- I have no idea.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.811 --> 02:19.109
Garret, do come back to me.

02:19.921 --> 02:23.179
- Swear that you are mine.
- I am yours to command.

02:35.776 --> 02:40.101
The last remaining portrait
of Rosmund as a child

02:40.433 --> 02:43.078
in the secret compartment
under her armoire.

02:43.242 --> 02:48.421
The real Rosmund
had a misshapen face.

03:33.905 --> 03:35.554
Garret,
what are you doing?

03:36.634 --> 03:38.723
Garret,
put the sword down.

03:39.100 --> 03:40.232
Garret!

03:40.687 --> 03:42.914
Garret, put the sword down!

03:47.075 --> 03:48.937
What have I done?

03:56.977 --> 03:58.695
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE OUTPOST*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 02  Episode 10</font>

03:58.812 --> 04:00.812
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE OUTPOST*</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Only Way"</font>

04:01.195 --> 04:04.351
- We're here.
- What was this place?

04:04.604 --> 04:07.281
Vor-Anden was built to honor
the Seven Warriors of Old.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.429
And if the legends
are to be believed,

04:09.890 --> 04:11.734
the key should unlock
what we came for.

04:11.916 --> 04:13.460
Unlock what?

04:14.296 --> 04:16.789
Hopefully, the power we need
to save our people.

04:18.408 --> 04:20.541
And save the Queen.

04:20.978 --> 04:22.370
Of course.

04:47.344 --> 04:48.757
You do the honors.

05:18.947 --> 05:20.698
What is that?

05:21.712 --> 05:23.237
A constellation.

05:28.267 --> 05:31.737
What are you looking for?

05:31.871 --> 05:33.362
Bellator.

05:33.925 --> 05:36.166
The greatest Blackblood
warrior to ever live.

05:36.469 --> 05:39.330
Frozen forever in the stars
as a reminder of his strength.

05:39.698 --> 05:41.035
He should be somewhere
to the north

05:41.122 --> 05:42.520
of this constellation
somewhere.

05:42.893 --> 05:44.356
You can read the stars?

05:44.650 --> 05:45.697
When I lived in this
world,

05:45.785 --> 05:47.439
my mother and I would spend
hours every night

05:47.526 --> 05:49.635
just looking up
at the stars.

05:50.087 --> 05:52.651
She died in the war
before we were banished...

05:53.792 --> 05:55.549
under the sky she loved.

05:56.009 --> 05:57.415
I'm sorry.

06:05.685 --> 06:06.863
Wait.

06:09.706 --> 06:11.129
Bellator.

06:44.539 --> 06:47.194
I don't understand.
You came here to kill me?

06:47.282 --> 06:49.379
Janzo destroyed the medication.

06:49.471 --> 06:50.933
I don't know, I...

06:51.249 --> 06:53.629
In the Capital,
they showed me this painting.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.363
It's me, Alton, and my parents.

06:55.451 --> 06:57.215
It had your parents
and your brother,

06:57.303 --> 06:59.691
but it had a different
little girl in it.

07:00.018 --> 07:01.672
Right, tonight,
when I saw this version,

07:01.760 --> 07:05.808
it was like a fog just...
It just poured out.

07:06.606 --> 07:08.047
I cannot stay at the Outpost.

07:08.135 --> 07:09.588
You are not leaving.

07:09.676 --> 07:11.277
- I have to.
- Why?

07:11.365 --> 07:12.808
Because of
what I've done.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.785
I came here
to try and kill you.

07:14.873 --> 07:17.277
I tried to kill Talon and...

07:18.629 --> 07:20.806
And Wythers.

07:21.902 --> 07:23.222
Oh, Gods, Wythers.

07:23.533 --> 07:25.012
What about him?

07:26.090 --> 07:29.402
- I killed him.
- What?

07:29.863 --> 07:32.769
Gwynn, they made me kill
my own father.

07:34.008 --> 07:36.090
I have to go.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.918
It's time that their weapon
was turned against them.

07:39.039 --> 07:40.869
If revenge is what
you want,

07:40.957 --> 07:43.035
then stay here and
help us defeat them.

07:43.123 --> 07:45.125
Getting yourself killed
accomplishes nothing.

07:45.222 --> 07:48.222
I have been gone from the
Capital for too long already.

07:48.387 --> 07:49.908
All right?
It is a matter of time

07:49.996 --> 07:52.137
before The Three realize
I have failed.

07:52.570 --> 07:54.093
They will send an army.

07:54.363 --> 07:56.207
And that's why they haven't
already attacked.

07:56.295 --> 07:58.582
Hopefully they still
think I'm one of them.

07:58.902 --> 08:01.600
I have to go
into the lion's den.

08:02.229 --> 08:03.715
Please.

08:04.549 --> 08:06.073
I need you here.

08:06.229 --> 08:08.449
No, after all I've done,
there is no way

08:08.537 --> 08:10.676
that you still care about me.

08:13.488 --> 08:15.360
You have Baron Aegisford now.

08:15.564 --> 08:17.348
I thought you were dead.

08:17.638 --> 08:19.527
A lot has happened.

08:19.946 --> 08:21.730
Am I still a prisoner?

08:24.014 --> 08:26.634
Guards,
inform the other soldiers

08:26.722 --> 08:28.816
that Garret Spears
is no longer a prisoner.

08:29.044 --> 08:32.183
He's free to come and go
from the Outpost as he pleases.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.154
Leave us.

09:15.004 --> 09:16.614
I can't.

09:20.370 --> 09:21.850
Your Majesty.

09:35.296 --> 09:36.950
What's this supposed to be?

09:38.776 --> 09:40.480
What?

09:42.613 --> 09:44.441
Where's the weapon
you spoke of?

09:46.348 --> 09:47.965
Zed?

09:48.531 --> 09:49.926
No.

09:51.846 --> 09:53.410
This can't be all there is.

10:05.820 --> 10:07.789
Is this one supposed to
have a hole in it?

10:08.148 --> 10:09.929
They're all holes.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.718
Empty holes.

10:13.836 --> 10:16.015
No, this one has another one
in the bottom,

10:16.823 --> 10:18.999
like it's been chewed through
or something.

10:27.211 --> 10:29.250
Maybe it chewed its way out.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.695
What did?

11:06.243 --> 11:07.618
Got it.

11:12.659 --> 11:14.487
Is that what I think it was?

11:14.637 --> 11:16.916
- It's a Kinj.
- Like mine?

11:17.125 --> 11:19.877
Different.
It can't open portals.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.016
There's only one Asterkinj,
and it lives in you.

11:22.174 --> 11:23.641
And you knew
it would be here?

11:23.752 --> 11:25.182
I hoped.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.322
But I don't know
what this one is

11:27.469 --> 11:29.297
or what it does.

11:29.783 --> 11:32.002
It's not going to do
something terrible, is it?

11:32.425 --> 11:33.697
What do the legends say?

11:33.785 --> 11:35.557
Well, there are supposed
to be seven of them.

11:35.846 --> 11:38.002
The Asterkinj and six more.

11:38.303 --> 11:40.369
Each offers its host
a different power.

11:41.883 --> 11:44.307
The warriors must have come
and taken them over time.

11:45.553 --> 11:48.469
- So what does yours do?
- I have no idea.

11:48.884 --> 11:50.886
I don't know
what triggers it, either.

11:51.137 --> 11:52.922
How does yours work?

11:58.101 --> 12:01.244
Talon.
Look, help me understand.

12:01.870 --> 12:03.472
It's going to be no help
to either of us

12:03.560 --> 12:05.479
if I can't figure out
how to use it.

12:06.506 --> 12:08.494
I don't know how
to describe it.

12:09.108 --> 12:12.221
First time I used my Kinj,
it was because I was in danger.

12:12.436 --> 12:14.041
It's like it knew I needed it.

12:14.144 --> 12:15.471
And now?

12:15.774 --> 12:18.666
Now I just concentrate on what
I want and the portal opens.

12:18.755 --> 12:22.322
Right, but in order for me
to be able to do that...

12:23.473 --> 12:25.606
You'll have to figure out
what it does.

12:28.046 --> 12:32.158
We must draw up plans to break the siege
as soon as tomorrow. - What's the hurry?

12:32.385 --> 12:35.328
The Prime Order will be here any day
now when they realize Garret failed.

12:35.416 --> 12:38.260
With respect, Your Majesty,
we will be outnumbered.

12:38.913 --> 12:41.221
We won't stand a chance,
regardless of the siege.

12:41.449 --> 12:45.672
True, which is why
we need Milus' army to join us.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.596
We should perform
a surgical strike,

12:47.835 --> 12:49.315
kill the snake at the head.

12:49.455 --> 12:52.100
With Milus dead,
his army becomes my army,

12:52.221 --> 12:54.363
and therefore, your army.

12:54.450 --> 12:56.924
Exactly.
It's our only chance.

12:57.012 --> 12:59.094
But to get to
Milus, we would have

12:59.182 --> 13:00.934
to go through most
of his fighters.

13:01.022 --> 13:04.830
Thereby destroying the very army
we wish to join us, I know.

13:05.293 --> 13:07.010
But we must think
of something.

13:11.103 --> 13:13.947
Guard! Get him! Get him!

13:15.853 --> 13:19.096
- The Queen says he's free.
- You cured me, Janzo.

13:19.184 --> 13:21.883
What, so you, the person who
tried to kill the Queen, is free?

13:21.971 --> 13:24.393
And I'm still a prisoner?
Well, that makes sense, doesn't it?

13:26.178 --> 13:28.485
- Are you really cured?
- Yes.

13:28.993 --> 13:31.143
I'm finally beginning
to think clearly.

13:32.807 --> 13:33.984
Promise you won't hurt me.

13:34.072 --> 13:35.177
I promise.

13:37.783 --> 13:41.221
Hm. Normal pupillary
reaction to light.

13:41.410 --> 13:44.109
Not overly dilated.
And your eyes... hm.

13:44.196 --> 13:46.851
They're not bloodshot anymore.
Give me your hands.

13:47.149 --> 13:48.807
Hands seems steady.

13:51.048 --> 13:54.268
Congratulations on your freedom.
Must be nice.

13:54.510 --> 13:55.816
Some of us
don't have that luxury.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.633
Listen, Janzo,
a bit of a favor to ask.

13:58.721 --> 14:00.859
- Hmm?
- I need to find Talon.

14:00.947 --> 14:03.453
Did Gwynn reject you
and so now you're going to

14:03.541 --> 14:05.609
try and run
into the arms of Talon?

14:05.696 --> 14:07.872
Come on, Garret.
It's so predictable, even for you.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.578
No, it is nothing like that.

14:09.666 --> 14:11.072
I have to return
to the Capital.

14:11.197 --> 14:14.244
- What for?
- To kill the people who did this to me.

14:14.446 --> 14:16.619
Oh, so that's why
you need Talon.

14:16.707 --> 14:18.141
- To help you with your revenge.
- No, no, it...

14:18.228 --> 14:19.924
- it's not revenge,
- In my experience,

14:20.012 --> 14:21.244
- Janzo, it's to save
- that's never a good idea.

14:21.331 --> 14:22.588
- The Queen and the Realm.
- Do you know what? The Garret

14:22.675 --> 14:23.860
I knew would never be this rash.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.498
Clearly you're not
fully cured, are you?

14:25.585 --> 14:26.630
Aah!

14:31.416 --> 14:35.643
I'm sorry.
I... obviously, you're right.

14:36.111 --> 14:37.994
Perhaps I need to
concoct you a new brew.

14:38.135 --> 14:39.331
Look, Janzo,
I need to confront

14:39.418 --> 14:42.322
the people
who did this to me.

14:43.518 --> 14:46.127
They made me kill
my own father.

14:46.214 --> 14:49.758
Now please,
tell me where Talon is.

14:49.846 --> 14:51.859
- Fine.
- Thank you.

14:51.947 --> 14:53.619
She left for
the Shrine of Vor-Anden.

14:53.707 --> 14:54.844
And what is that?

14:54.955 --> 14:56.376
It's a shrine.
I just told you.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.994
I'll draw you a map.

14:59.212 --> 15:01.524
When you do eventually see her,
she's probably going to kill you

15:01.611 --> 15:03.140
because, after all,
you did stab her.

15:03.228 --> 15:04.899
Anyways, you're not going
to get very far, are you,

15:04.986 --> 15:06.539
with Milus' army
surrounding us?

15:06.626 --> 15:08.463
Yes, thank you, Janzo.

15:13.111 --> 15:14.830
When you do eventually
find her...

15:14.918 --> 15:16.773
- Mm-hmm.
- ...maybe you can enlist the help

15:16.861 --> 15:18.234
of Talon's
new Blackblood friend.

15:18.322 --> 15:19.461
I'm sorry, who?

15:19.549 --> 15:22.383
Lovely chap. Handsome.
Hates humans.

15:22.471 --> 15:24.705
I'm sure the two of you
will get on swimmingly.

15:24.830 --> 15:26.080
Here's your map.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.853
Thank you.

16:43.201 --> 16:44.663
Hi, Mom.

16:47.866 --> 16:51.311
You look dumber
than a donkey.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.331
Did you bring the coin?

16:53.419 --> 16:54.489
Of course.

16:54.608 --> 16:56.871
Oh. Oh, good.

16:57.132 --> 16:59.565
'Cause if this siege
goes down the toilet,

16:59.652 --> 17:02.619
then maybe I can use it
to buy my way out of it.

17:02.707 --> 17:04.329
You mean our way, right?

17:04.417 --> 17:06.503
Yeah, sure, that too.
That too.

17:15.878 --> 17:20.463
- Mother!
- As I was saying, how dare you do this?

17:20.550 --> 17:22.979
Under the Queen's nose!
Do you know what?

17:23.067 --> 17:25.713
I should string you up
in the middle of the street

17:25.800 --> 17:27.767
and poke you full of holes.

17:27.854 --> 17:32.250
And then I should fill those holes
with more holes, and fill those...

17:32.337 --> 17:34.252
Go on, get out of my sight.

17:34.643 --> 17:36.601
You're fired!

17:41.873 --> 17:44.478
Have you done something new
with your hair?

17:44.638 --> 17:48.123
You're making colipsum
inside the Outpost walls?

17:49.267 --> 17:51.263
- With live Plaguelings?
- No.

17:51.435 --> 17:54.185
Are you mad?
I'm trying to find a cure.

17:54.272 --> 17:56.832
I'm trying to stop people
from turning Plagueling,

17:56.920 --> 17:58.896
and here you are
creating more of them!

18:01.490 --> 18:04.787
I'm going to tell Gwynn
about this at once.

18:05.673 --> 18:06.849
- Janzo?
- Huh?

18:06.937 --> 18:08.503
How many Plaguelings...
Sorry,

18:08.590 --> 18:11.560
live Plaguelings have you got
in your lab right now?

18:12.224 --> 18:13.840
- Six.
- Six.

18:13.928 --> 18:15.592
I don't really see
why that matters

18:15.680 --> 18:17.787
because we're going to go
to Gwynn right now,

18:17.948 --> 18:19.653
and we're going to tell her
about all of this.

18:19.740 --> 18:21.349
You're absolutely right.

18:21.437 --> 18:23.352
We are going to go to Gwynn

18:23.441 --> 18:26.183
and we're going to tell her
all about this.

18:26.434 --> 18:30.006
This is gonna save
the Outpost!

18:31.439 --> 18:34.107
Someone better tell me
why they had me awakened

18:34.211 --> 18:36.561
before I lose my sense
of curiosity entirely.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.791
You're never going to guess
what your advisor's been up to.

18:38.878 --> 18:41.388
- And what is that?
- Manufacturing colipsum

18:41.475 --> 18:43.475
inside your Outpost.

18:44.717 --> 18:46.974
- Is that so?
- In my defense,

18:47.104 --> 18:49.670
colipsum is how you keep
your coffers full.

18:49.759 --> 18:51.761
People are dying, Elinor.
Nothing is worth that.

18:51.950 --> 18:53.459
Yes, yes, yes,
I know that now.

18:53.547 --> 18:55.332
But, look,
here's the wiggle.

18:55.420 --> 18:59.631
I think there could be a way
to take this tiny mishap of mine

18:59.719 --> 19:04.099
and use it
to destroy the siege.

19:04.524 --> 19:06.060
I'm listening.

19:06.278 --> 19:09.933
Release the Plaguelings from
the sewers and from Janzo's lab.

19:10.021 --> 19:11.902
That might scare Milus' army
for the moment,

19:11.990 --> 19:14.707
but unless you can insure that
every soldier is taking colipsum,

19:14.795 --> 19:16.410
it won't do much more
than that.

19:16.874 --> 19:20.980
What... what if I told you
that I can be sure

19:21.068 --> 19:23.004
that every soldier
was taking colipsum?

19:23.092 --> 19:24.301
Or most of them.

19:24.389 --> 19:26.645
You mean you've been selling
colipsum to the soldiers

19:26.733 --> 19:28.168
that are holding us hostage.

19:28.256 --> 19:30.980
You suggest we turn an entire
battalion into Plaguelings?

19:31.151 --> 19:32.879
- That is a death sentence.
- Yeah, but

19:32.967 --> 19:35.133
they either die fighting
our men or this.

19:35.221 --> 19:38.754
And if we infect them all,
then we don't lose a single soldier.

19:38.842 --> 19:40.738
If I can just interrupt
for a brief moment.

19:40.855 --> 19:43.355
Your Majesty,
I'm very close to finding a cure.

19:43.665 --> 19:46.668
How close? - I don't know.
I've already cured two Plaguelings.

19:46.756 --> 19:47.957
I'm not really sure how.

19:48.045 --> 19:50.417
- Medicine is such an imprecise science.
- Can you find...

19:50.505 --> 19:51.528
It's like you can...

19:51.615 --> 19:53.238
Can you find a cure?

19:54.707 --> 19:56.056
I hope so.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.770
I must admit,
I couldn't believe it

19:58.884 --> 20:00.285
when I heard that
you were here.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.723
Especially given you were
working for Dred,

20:02.811 --> 20:07.318
and his status has been
diminished as of late.

20:07.613 --> 20:09.654
The new ambassador
informed me.

20:09.764 --> 20:13.115
I have an urgent report to deliver
about the Gallwood Outpost,

20:13.206 --> 20:15.309
but I cannot do so
until I speak with Dred.

20:15.404 --> 20:18.407
- This is highly unusual.
- I understand.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.014
Then I must deliver
an incomplete report

20:21.102 --> 20:22.669
to the new ambassador
and tell him

20:22.757 --> 20:25.499
who is responsible
for the loose ends.

20:25.587 --> 20:27.818
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That won't be necessary.

20:27.906 --> 20:29.920
Right this way, please.

20:54.262 --> 20:56.670
Now this is a surprise.

20:58.678 --> 21:00.762
I thought seeing you in here

21:00.850 --> 21:04.156
would give me
some sense of relief.

21:04.438 --> 21:07.398
- And it doesn't?
- No.

21:08.467 --> 21:12.115
- But it does bring me joy.
- Joy?

21:14.282 --> 21:16.849
We made a deal years ago
when I began serving you.

21:16.937 --> 21:17.938
Oh.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.803
I've held up my end, Dred.

21:22.611 --> 21:24.342
I'm here for my family.

21:25.428 --> 21:27.396
I am so sorry.

21:27.669 --> 21:29.881
Tell me where they are.

21:30.092 --> 21:31.857
They mean nothing
to you now.

21:31.952 --> 21:34.850
They've meant nothing to me
for a long time.

21:35.634 --> 21:37.679
I killed them years ago.

21:39.435 --> 21:43.342
- No. That can't be true.
- And yet, it is.

21:46.591 --> 21:49.498
And now you're thinking,

21:50.028 --> 21:53.686
"Did I do all that
for nothing?

21:53.859 --> 21:56.701
Grow close to someone
whom I betrayed?

21:56.789 --> 22:00.326
And now coming here
for nothing?"

22:01.506 --> 22:03.998
Everyone you care about
is dead.

22:05.941 --> 22:07.584
My condolences.

22:08.878 --> 22:10.248
Not everyone.

22:11.939 --> 22:15.247
If you are referring to
those traitors you befriended,

22:15.335 --> 22:18.568
if they're not dead yet,
they will be by the time you return.

22:18.782 --> 22:20.191
The Prime Order is preparing

22:20.279 --> 22:22.881
to march upon
Gallwood Outpost as we speak.

22:23.170 --> 22:24.514
You can't know that.

22:24.658 --> 22:26.107
Guards talk.

22:26.331 --> 22:29.170
I know, awful news, isn't it?

22:29.382 --> 22:31.521
Go, warn them,

22:31.708 --> 22:33.811
but you'll never
reach them in time.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.257
You've taken so much from me.

22:40.852 --> 22:44.428
My freedom, my home,

22:45.014 --> 22:47.037
my family.

22:47.319 --> 22:50.904
But there is one thing
you will never be able to take,

22:51.090 --> 22:55.131
one thing that will always
bring me joy.

22:55.219 --> 22:56.936
And what is that?

22:57.318 --> 23:00.670
The look on your face
when I do this.

23:41.344 --> 23:42.737
It's Tobin, is it?

23:43.872 --> 23:46.255
- Commander Spears.
- Oh, no.

23:46.431 --> 23:48.824
Not anymore,
and understandably so.

23:48.912 --> 23:51.001
Although, if whispers
are to be believed,

23:51.089 --> 23:53.825
it sounds as though
you have claimed that title.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.700
Is there something
I can do for you?

23:56.787 --> 23:59.200
Yes, there is.
I need to get out of here,

23:59.288 --> 24:02.333
and I cannot do that while
the Outpost is under siege.

24:02.421 --> 24:05.728
So, Commander,
what are you doing to break it?

24:19.444 --> 24:21.054
Is everything ready?

24:21.142 --> 24:23.797
Just waiting for orders
from the Queen to proceed.

24:23.885 --> 24:26.403
So, what is the plan?

24:26.534 --> 24:27.924
Garret,
what are you doing here?

24:28.012 --> 24:30.711
- Take this man away, he's drunk.
- I'm not drunk. Mostly.

24:30.799 --> 24:32.714
Garret, you got
no place up here.

24:32.802 --> 24:34.245
- Hello, Mistress.
- Hello.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.284
Congratulations
on the promotion.

24:36.372 --> 24:39.002
- This should be good, yeah?
- Guard, take him.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.690
Actually, um,
Garret can stay.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.174
I'm curious to see
what he'll think of our plan.

24:44.963 --> 24:46.823
Elinor, you may proceed.

24:50.978 --> 24:52.589
Let 'em go!

25:22.357 --> 25:24.835
They're calling all their
friends from the forest.

25:24.923 --> 25:28.883
Wait. Wait, did you just use
Plaguelings to fight your battle?

25:29.357 --> 25:31.585
I've done a horrible thing.

25:31.673 --> 25:34.197
No, you haven't.
You're saving your people.

25:34.285 --> 25:36.499
That's a choice
a good queen makes.

25:41.885 --> 25:44.449
I don't think any of this
could be called good.

25:44.688 --> 25:47.605
Not good, but effective.

25:47.693 --> 25:49.739
And necessary.

25:49.827 --> 25:51.959
Mistress,
this is an ingenious plan.

25:52.047 --> 25:53.520
Knew I liked you.

26:43.901 --> 26:45.251
What's wrong?

26:47.595 --> 26:49.162
Thought I heard something.

26:54.691 --> 26:56.293
You all right?

26:57.586 --> 27:00.050
We're just near
the Greyskin border.

27:01.040 --> 27:03.785
It's unlike you to be scared
of a few Greyskins.

27:04.487 --> 27:07.621
I'm more worried about the Prime
Order who patrol the border.

27:08.778 --> 27:11.390
Wouldn't be the stupidest thing to
worry about the Greyskins, either.

27:11.477 --> 27:13.480
Mm, I guess not.

27:15.873 --> 27:19.096
Well, I'm really sorry
to have to leave you in this

27:19.184 --> 27:23.759
uh, scared state,
but I have to...

27:25.303 --> 27:27.174
I think I'll survive.

27:55.430 --> 27:57.432
<i>Put your hand in the fire.</i>

28:00.700 --> 28:02.087
Leave it there.

28:04.827 --> 28:06.307
Keep it there.

28:09.806 --> 28:11.982
Good boy.

28:25.207 --> 28:27.296
What if we don't go back?

28:30.034 --> 28:32.447
What if we returned
to the mountain,

28:33.007 --> 28:36.707
to the ruins,
and rebuild them with our people?

28:37.193 --> 28:39.325
You and I can bring
the Blackbloods home.

28:39.528 --> 28:43.663
We will, Zed,
but with Gwynn's blessing.

28:45.686 --> 28:48.642
Separate lands,
separate people.

28:48.849 --> 28:52.200
Bring her your Kinj,
and we'll fight for her.

28:52.553 --> 28:55.731
- She'll give us her blessing.
- Her blessing? Right.

28:55.927 --> 28:59.369
- She's the Queen.
- For the humans. Not us.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.265
Nonetheless,
I still trust her.

29:01.353 --> 29:02.763
Yeah, well, it's hard
for me to do the same,

29:02.850 --> 29:04.939
especially where
humans are concerned.

29:05.401 --> 29:06.968
I've seen too much.

29:07.540 --> 29:08.783
Chances are your queen

29:08.871 --> 29:10.736
will never give us
her blessing anyway.

29:11.332 --> 29:13.160
Not willingly.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.927
- What are you doing?
- Looking for Milus' body.

30:07.015 --> 30:08.799
Maybe he'll be alive.

30:12.169 --> 30:13.301
Be careful.

31:02.745 --> 31:04.158
I'm sorry, cousin.

31:30.883 --> 31:34.147
I am Tobin Aegisford,
son of Rovinus.

31:34.311 --> 31:38.150
Milus had no heirs.
I am his closest relative.

31:38.318 --> 31:41.486
His lands and his titles
will pass to me.

31:41.574 --> 31:43.728
Lord Tobin is your liege.

31:43.854 --> 31:47.845
You do not serve him.
He serves you.

31:48.007 --> 31:51.798
We both do. If you pledge
allegiance to me in the war to come,

31:51.886 --> 31:53.845
then we will make sure
you are looked after,

31:54.070 --> 31:57.220
starting with shelter
from this Plagueling attack.

31:57.308 --> 31:58.954
If you've been bitten,
fear not.

31:59.275 --> 32:01.118
I have the very best mind
in the Realm

32:01.287 --> 32:02.636
developing a cure.

32:02.793 --> 32:05.392
Join us or go.

32:06.239 --> 32:08.189
The choice is yours to make.

32:16.970 --> 32:18.720
Uh, excuse me.
You seem clammy.

32:18.808 --> 32:20.549
Are you clammy?

32:20.895 --> 32:22.331
Disgusting.
You are clammy.

32:22.418 --> 32:25.212
Quarantine him
in section one, please. Next!

32:25.305 --> 32:27.481
Uh-huh. Open up.

32:27.685 --> 32:30.603
Hmm. Relatively healthy. Into the
healthy section. Thank you very much.

32:30.691 --> 32:32.923
Keep them coming. Next!

32:33.439 --> 32:35.151
I don't even want
to look at you, thank you.

32:35.238 --> 32:36.805
- Janzo?
- Hello.

32:36.897 --> 32:38.639
What are the chances
they're not all infected?

32:38.726 --> 32:41.033
- We need new recruits.
- I'm taking all precautions.

32:41.121 --> 32:43.079
I'm separating each one
by symptoms.

32:43.167 --> 32:45.518
I'm putting the ones who are
most likely infected into here,

32:45.605 --> 32:47.651
along with the most
who aren't over there.

32:47.739 --> 32:50.089
- How many probably aren't?
- About ten percent.

32:50.177 --> 32:52.548
There's a lot in this group
who, uh, take colipsum.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.502
Well, if that's true, we're not
going to have the numbers we need

32:54.589 --> 32:57.331
- to fight the Prime Order.
- Look, I'm trying my best.

32:57.450 --> 32:59.142
As I said,
I've almost found a cure.

32:59.230 --> 33:02.189
I think. Two cured Plaguelings
is nothing to sneeze at.

33:02.370 --> 33:06.407
Yes, well, we need to cure
hundreds, so work faster.

33:07.335 --> 33:08.884
Next!

33:09.661 --> 33:11.738
Oh, no way.
Thank you so much.

33:11.826 --> 33:13.535
Keep them coming!
Keep them coming!

33:13.623 --> 33:15.929
Come on!
There's space! Let's go!

33:23.449 --> 33:26.147
- You leaving already?
- The siege is broken.

33:26.679 --> 33:27.707
I can finally go.

33:27.795 --> 33:30.319
It's a shame we didn't really
get to know one another.

33:30.961 --> 33:33.175
It seems we have
a lot in common.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.644
Well, there may be
time enough for that

33:35.975 --> 33:39.340
- when I return.
- You plan to return?

33:41.279 --> 33:44.472
Right. Well,
I look forward to that.

33:47.757 --> 33:50.934
When you're ready,
Orlick wanted to speak with us.

33:55.523 --> 33:57.613
Good-bye, Gwynn.

34:02.391 --> 34:04.347
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

34:09.770 --> 34:12.956
Four droplets
of distilled blossom vine

34:13.045 --> 34:16.222
and one spoonful
of sky vine essence.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.094
- Janzo?
- I'm busy, Mother.

34:31.011 --> 34:33.259
I don't giving a stinking
cockscomb if you're busy.

34:33.347 --> 34:36.623
- You owe me an apology.
- Apology? Apology for what?

34:36.710 --> 34:39.681
Uh, how about overreacting,
for a start?

34:39.768 --> 34:42.152
Not trusting your dear mother.

34:42.239 --> 34:45.275
How about underestimating
my brilliance?

34:45.362 --> 34:47.721
I have been
raking in the gold.

34:47.808 --> 34:49.416
By poisoning
the entire Realm.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.551
By giving people
what they want.

34:51.643 --> 34:53.422
I've been managing
to make this gold

34:53.510 --> 34:56.295
and help the Queen
shimmy out of a jam.

34:56.418 --> 34:59.342
Your mother is
a bloody genius and... ow!

35:01.655 --> 35:04.080
- Oh, no.
- It bit me!

35:06.426 --> 35:09.140
- Ow!
- Mother, please tell me

35:09.228 --> 35:10.788
you haven't been
taking any colipsum.

35:13.998 --> 35:15.173
Of course I have.

35:18.512 --> 35:21.101
- Hold that.
- Uh, Janzo?

35:21.189 --> 35:22.915
- Hmm?
- You're really close

35:23.048 --> 35:24.497
to finding a cure,
aren't you?

35:24.584 --> 35:26.266
I mean, that's what
you've been doing all...

35:26.353 --> 35:28.049
- All the time down here.
- It's just I've been

35:28.136 --> 35:30.051
a bit distracted
lately, Mother.

35:30.198 --> 35:32.505
My attention's been redirected
by the Queen several times.

35:32.592 --> 35:34.507
That's not to say
that I'm not close.

35:34.665 --> 35:36.248
Janzo!

35:38.384 --> 35:40.343
Everything's going to be
all right, Mother.

35:42.167 --> 35:43.168
I promise.

35:46.665 --> 35:48.260
Excuse me, excuse me.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.436
Excuse me, I need to ask you
both some questions.

35:50.523 --> 35:53.613
Oh, we're having
a special evening together.

35:53.700 --> 35:56.703
Can it wait? - No, it can't. I
need your help to cure more like you.

35:56.869 --> 35:59.532
- What can we do?
- Are you sure you don't remember

35:59.619 --> 36:01.110
anything that happened to you
before you turned,

36:01.197 --> 36:02.840
well, into you?

36:02.927 --> 36:05.190
Just hacking up that worm.

36:05.277 --> 36:07.259
- Yeah.
- You're scratching.

36:07.592 --> 36:09.769
Is this where you were bitten by
the Plagueling before you turned?

36:09.856 --> 36:12.249
No. Well, maybe.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.068
I don't know.
I think so.

36:14.181 --> 36:16.680
- Yeah, same.
- Do you eat any foods

36:16.767 --> 36:17.820
that most people don't?

36:17.908 --> 36:19.291
No, we are both pretty much

36:19.378 --> 36:20.597
meat and potatoes folk.

36:20.684 --> 36:22.599
Well, there's
the tong-long root.

36:22.750 --> 36:24.679
Oh, tong-long root, yeah.

36:24.767 --> 36:26.603
- You both eat tong-long root?
- Mm-hmm.

36:26.690 --> 36:28.518
- Isn't that painfully bitter?
- Of course.

36:28.605 --> 36:32.086
But that's what makes it so
good sprinkled over potatoes.

36:32.173 --> 36:34.353
Yeah, it gives them flavor.

36:34.441 --> 36:36.704
Maybe you need tong-long root
in your system

36:36.792 --> 36:39.626
in order for the Trayly flower
and the vine to react.

36:39.714 --> 36:41.259
- Thank you.
- What?

36:50.837 --> 36:52.447
Have you worked it out?

36:52.962 --> 36:54.017
Not yet.

36:54.105 --> 36:56.695
What? But you talked
to those people who were cured.

36:56.783 --> 36:59.331
- What did they tell you?
- They eat tong-long root.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.460
Oh. Oh, is that
what I could smell?

37:01.548 --> 37:03.533
It smells like
a chamber pot. Ugh!

37:03.660 --> 37:07.751
I'm doing an experiment.
It's a reduction of Trayly flower, vine,

37:07.839 --> 37:10.281
- and tong-long root.
- Smells disgusting.

37:10.369 --> 37:12.039
- Let's give it a go.
- I suppose it's ready.

37:12.126 --> 37:14.431
Will you, Mum,
please open its mouth?

37:15.625 --> 37:18.023
You've been stung, Mother.
It's not gonna get any worse.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.178
- You sure about that?
- Positive.

37:20.265 --> 37:25.642
You know, at times like this,
I really miss Munt.

37:25.923 --> 37:29.492
You ready? - Oh,
I got a really good feeling about this.

38:02.238 --> 38:03.372
Hmm.

38:04.852 --> 38:07.202
Just to be clear,
you won't be doing that to me.

38:07.399 --> 38:08.879
No killing
of your dear mother.

38:08.966 --> 38:11.185
- Got it.
- Good boy.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.154
Keep working.

38:33.556 --> 38:35.340
<i>Freeze!</i>

38:35.700 --> 38:37.589
Stay there.

38:37.677 --> 38:39.877
I really think you should
get out from under that thing.

38:43.986 --> 38:45.422
Why isn't he moving?

38:51.401 --> 38:53.986
You mind explaining to me
what just happened?

38:54.585 --> 38:56.558
Well, you were almost crushed
to death by that Greyskin

38:56.645 --> 38:58.664
while I was relieving
myself in the trees.

38:58.752 --> 39:00.189
I'm not talking about him.

39:00.277 --> 39:01.887
I'm talking about you.

39:03.224 --> 39:05.922
You used your Kinj.
I saw it glow.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.406
I guess I did.
I didn't realize.

39:07.494 --> 39:10.057
Liar. You knew exactly
what you were doing.

39:10.145 --> 39:11.842
I just saved your life!

39:12.107 --> 39:13.559
You're welcome.

39:13.739 --> 39:15.828
You knew what it does,
and you hid it from me.

39:16.430 --> 39:18.363
I trusted you.

39:19.487 --> 39:23.801
I thought... thought maybe I...
When were you going to tell me?

39:23.889 --> 39:25.494
After you used it on humans?

39:25.582 --> 39:26.941
Can you just stop for a second

39:27.029 --> 39:29.310
and think about what might have
happened if I wasn't here?

39:29.676 --> 39:31.809
You would be dead,
and all hope

39:31.897 --> 39:33.552
for all Blackbloods
would also die with you.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.162
Yeah, well,
it might have been better.

39:35.250 --> 39:38.277
Seems to me I can trust humans
more than any Blackblood.

39:38.365 --> 39:39.585
That's not true.
I can show you.

39:39.672 --> 39:41.891
Just open the portal
and free our people.

39:43.229 --> 39:44.379
No.

39:47.153 --> 39:49.460
I really didn't want
to have to do this.

39:50.039 --> 39:51.551
You leave me no choice.

39:56.111 --> 39:57.730
<i>Open the portal.</i>

39:58.418 --> 40:02.434
Mind control.
So that's what your Kinj does.

40:02.848 --> 40:04.402
And you'd use it on me?

40:04.777 --> 40:06.449
You'd force me
to do your bidding?

40:06.537 --> 40:08.809
- Talon, I can explain.
- No more talking.

40:13.078 --> 40:15.621
- Your Kinj doesn't work on me.
- Why?

40:15.709 --> 40:18.016
My Asterkinj won't let it.
I can feel it.

40:18.104 --> 40:19.699
They're protecting their hosts.

40:27.553 --> 40:29.903
Yours doesn't seem
to be protecting you.

40:36.526 --> 40:37.806
I don't want to fight you,
Talon.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.801
You just want to use me.

40:55.301 --> 40:58.086
It was the only way.

41:00.279 --> 41:02.759
All right.

41:20.167 --> 41:23.528
So this is it?
You're just going to kill me?

41:23.958 --> 41:27.138
I should. You betrayed me.
