WEBVTT

00:04.652 --> 00:07.054
This job is so boring, mom.

00:07.055 --> 00:11.258
The only thing older than the antiques
we sell are the customers who buy it.

00:11.259 --> 00:14.538
You should see this old
bat I'm looking at.

00:14.539 --> 00:17.890
Not you, I was talking
about this old bat!

00:17.891 --> 00:23.199
Trish, you've already offended six
customers and it's not even lunch yet!

00:23.200 --> 00:25.983
Oh yeah, about that, can I
go on my lunch break now?

00:25.984 --> 00:27.725
Sell something or you're fired.

00:27.726 --> 00:31.026
You... I'm watching you.

00:31.289 --> 00:35.125
Hey, Trish. Wow, look
at all these antiques.

00:35.126 --> 00:38.598
It's like a room full
of beautiful memories.

00:38.599 --> 00:42.066
This place smells like my
grandfather's dirty old shoes.

00:42.067 --> 00:45.418
Hey, it's my grandpa's shoes!

00:45.419 --> 00:47.712
Please tell me you guys
are gonna buy something.

00:47.713 --> 00:50.590
Actually, I just entered
a short story contest

00:50.591 --> 00:52.409
and I'm looking for a
vintage typewriter.

00:52.410 --> 00:56.804
I want something like
Ernest Hemingway wrote on.

00:56.805 --> 00:58.477
I have just the thing.

00:58.478 --> 01:01.418
That one's perfect!

01:06.191 --> 01:09.994
I'll take it, Trish. I'm sure
to win the contest with this.

01:09.995 --> 01:12.398
Not so fast, Red.

01:12.399 --> 01:14.251
Chuck.

01:14.252 --> 01:16.402
I entered the contest too.

01:16.403 --> 01:19.711
You're wasting your time, Chuck. I'm
gonna win the short story contest.

01:19.712 --> 01:25.483
You wish. My story's so short, you can
see its feet on its driver's license.

01:25.484 --> 01:30.002
My story's so short, it's not allowed
to go on any carnival rides.

01:30.003 --> 01:35.202
My story's so short, when it sits on a
dime its feet don't touch the ground.

01:35.203 --> 01:38.114
My story's so short,
that it's, um...

01:38.115 --> 01:41.055
That's it's, uh...

01:41.085 --> 01:42.856
I think I smell smoke.

01:42.857 --> 01:46.697
Must be your brain on overdrive.

01:48.407 --> 01:50.608
Save it for the contest.

01:50.609 --> 01:53.289
Adios, muchachos.

01:53.290 --> 01:58.150
That's right, Trishita
Bonita, I know Spanish.

02:00.486 --> 02:03.333
So are you gonna buy that
old typewriter or not, Dez?

02:03.334 --> 02:05.465
Let me test it out.

02:05.466 --> 02:06.547
Uh...

02:06.548 --> 02:11.228
"A giant man-eating fish
slowly approached".

02:14.019 --> 02:17.317
That's funny. That big
guy's eating Sushi.

02:17.318 --> 02:21.528
- Why is that funny?
- Because he's a giant man eating fish.

02:21.529 --> 02:24.575
Man-eating fish? Dez
just typed that.

02:24.576 --> 02:27.072
Whoa, maybe the
typewriter's magic.

02:27.073 --> 02:29.494
There's no such thing
as a magic typewriter.

02:29.495 --> 02:35.075
Let's test it out. "A crazy
bird came out of nowhere".

02:39.481 --> 02:41.726
Okay, that was just
a coincidence.

02:41.727 --> 02:43.806
- Type something else.
- Uh...

02:43.807 --> 02:48.667
"It began to rain hot
dogs inside the store".

02:56.442 --> 03:00.702
You guys see the hot
dogs too, right?

03:03.779 --> 03:06.881
<i>♪ When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

03:06.882 --> 03:10.016
<i>♪ 'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

03:10.017 --> 03:11.548
<i>♪ You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

03:11.549 --> 03:13.167
<i>♪ You're the perfect chord.</i>

03:13.168 --> 03:16.212
<i>♪ And I see our names
together on every billboard.</i>

03:16.213 --> 03:19.271
<i>♪ We're headed for the
top, we've got it on lock.</i>

03:19.272 --> 03:20.885
<i>♪ We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

03:20.886 --> 03:23.208
<i>♪ And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

03:23.209 --> 03:27.346
<i>♪ Oh, there's no way I
could make it without ya.</i>

03:27.347 --> 03:30.382
<i>♪ Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:30.383 --> 03:33.452
<i>♪ It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:33.453 --> 03:36.775
<i>♪ With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:36.776 --> 03:39.425
<i>♪ I own this dream.</i>

03:39.426 --> 03:42.803
<i>♪ 'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:42.804 --> 03:45.921
<i>♪ There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:45.922 --> 03:50.362
<i>♪ Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:56.363 --> 03:59.200
Okay, there's a logical
explanation for all of this.

03:59.201 --> 04:01.692
Guys eating Sushi
go into stores.

04:01.693 --> 04:04.010
Cuckoo clocks go off every hour.

04:04.011 --> 04:07.551
Hot dogs fall from the sky.

04:08.688 --> 04:11.356
Okay, maybe it is a
magic typewriter.

04:11.357 --> 04:13.492
The only thing magic
about that typewriter

04:13.493 --> 04:16.361
is that I was able to get some
sucker to buy it for 50 bucks.

04:16.362 --> 04:18.329
Thanks again, Dez.

04:18.331 --> 04:21.534
I think we should
keep testing it out.

04:21.535 --> 04:26.593
"The typewriter brought those
around it great fortune".

04:26.594 --> 04:29.114
Great fortune, great fortune!

04:29.115 --> 04:32.222
- I won, Ally!
- What did you win, dad?

04:32.223 --> 04:35.743
The Mall Association's store
owner of the year award.

04:35.744 --> 04:37.903
I want you to present me
with the award, honey.

04:37.904 --> 04:43.256
- I'm honored, Mr. Dawson.
- I was talking to my daughter.

04:43.257 --> 04:47.777
Oh, this is the second luckiest day of
my life, next to the day you were born.

04:47.778 --> 04:49.028
Aw.

04:49.029 --> 04:51.899
I'll never forget walking
out of that delivery room

04:51.900 --> 04:56.100
and finding a $20
bill on the floor.

04:58.139 --> 05:00.940
I'm starting to think this
typewriter really is magic.

05:00.941 --> 05:02.845
Dez, type something else.

05:02.846 --> 05:06.986
"Dez ate a giant
meat-lover's sub".

05:07.047 --> 05:09.949
Did somebody order a
meat-lover's sub?

05:09.950 --> 05:13.970
Okay, now I'm
starting to believe.

05:14.002 --> 05:15.461
Type something for me!

05:15.462 --> 05:19.482
Ooh, I want to date
a cheerleader.

05:20.558 --> 05:23.061
Did somebody order a
meat-lover's sub?

05:23.062 --> 05:26.252
Oops, I accidentally typed
over the last thing I wrote.

05:26.253 --> 05:28.747
That's okay, this one's better.

05:28.748 --> 05:32.111
Give me an "S"! Give me a "U"!
Give me a "B"!

05:32.112 --> 05:33.859
I'm Austin.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.780
'Sup?

05:42.932 --> 05:45.734
That typewriter's the
best thing ever!

05:45.735 --> 05:49.004
Thanks for my money tree, Dez.

05:49.005 --> 05:52.728
Here, go buy yourself
something pretty.

05:52.729 --> 05:55.238
That was a leaf.

05:55.239 --> 05:57.274
Thanks for all these books, Dez!

05:57.275 --> 06:00.649
There's enough here to
last me a whole week.

06:00.650 --> 06:02.847
You girls might
want to step aside.

06:02.848 --> 06:07.550
Austin's about to have
another dream come true.

06:07.551 --> 06:10.535
There's five seconds left,
The Heat are down by one.

06:10.536 --> 06:16.436
Austin Moon steals the ball and
does his famous Austin Moon dunk.

06:22.538 --> 06:24.840
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah!

06:24.841 --> 06:26.909
Give me an "A"! Give me a "U"!

06:26.910 --> 06:30.495
- Give me an "S"...
- Yeah yeah, we get it.

06:30.496 --> 06:33.242
What do you want
me to type next?

06:33.243 --> 06:35.244
Well, I have a driver's
test coming up.

06:35.245 --> 06:39.381
- You want Dez to help you pass?
- No, I want a new car when I pass.

06:39.382 --> 06:43.462
Something cool...
like a fire truck!

06:45.292 --> 06:46.914
Is that real money on that tree?

06:46.915 --> 06:48.808
- No.
- What?

06:48.809 --> 06:52.001
Yeah right. This
is a money tree!

06:52.002 --> 06:57.902
And a mermaid gave it to me as a reward
for finding her runaway unicorn.

06:59.402 --> 07:02.493
Why is everyone
acting so suspicious?

07:02.494 --> 07:05.174
What?! Suspicious?

07:05.175 --> 07:09.435
If anything, we're
acting unsuspicious.

07:11.049 --> 07:14.887
I hope you're prepared to
lose that contest, Dez-aster.

07:14.888 --> 07:17.577
Because I'm gonna write
the coolest story ever.

07:17.578 --> 07:22.892
Please. My story's so cool, it's
gonna host the next Winter Olympics.

07:22.893 --> 07:26.529
My story's so cool, when my
air conditioning breaks...

07:26.530 --> 07:29.465
I stand next to my
story to cool down.

07:29.466 --> 07:32.401
Yeah? Well, my story's so cool

07:32.402 --> 07:37.723
because everything I type on my
magic typewriter comes true.

07:37.724 --> 07:41.235
Did you just say you
have a magic typewriter?

07:41.236 --> 07:44.742
Yeah right, it's a
"magic" typewriter.

07:44.743 --> 07:48.530
He bought it from a leprechaun
with my money tree.

07:48.531 --> 07:50.194
Right.

07:50.195 --> 07:52.625
Well, I guess I'll mosey along.

07:52.626 --> 07:54.714
I'm going to the gym.

07:54.715 --> 07:58.135
That's right. I work out.

08:01.859 --> 08:03.975
Do you think he knows
my typewriter's magic?!

08:03.976 --> 08:06.090
Well, you pretty much
just told him it was.

08:06.091 --> 08:08.780
Oh! I better hide
it in a safe place.

08:08.781 --> 08:13.867
I'll type myself a giant castle surrounded
by a moat and fire-breathing dragons.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.726
Or you could just put it in the
practice room and lock the door.

08:16.727 --> 08:18.723
Hmm. Fine.

08:18.724 --> 08:24.624
"Dez picked up the typewriter and
carried it back to the practice room".

08:25.002 --> 08:30.402
Everything I type comes true!
It still blows my mind.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:39.578 --> 08:41.789
Shouldn't you be studying
for your driver's test?

08:41.791 --> 08:44.782
I am. I'm playing "Crash City".

08:44.783 --> 08:48.172
If I can drive a flaming semi
truck over a collapsing bridge,

08:48.173 --> 08:51.290
I'm pretty sure I
can parallel park.

08:51.291 --> 08:54.173
Too bad your driving test is on the
same day as my dad's award ceremony.

08:54.174 --> 08:57.218
- I was really hoping you could come.
- When you're done writing your speech,

08:57.219 --> 09:00.143
- you wanna grab something to eat?
- I can't, I gotta get back to work.

09:00.144 --> 09:02.104
It's packed downstairs.

09:02.105 --> 09:05.465
I can take care of that.

09:06.820 --> 09:12.720
"The customers fled in horror when the
giant elephant came out of nowhere".

09:13.042 --> 09:15.142
I wish.

09:19.653 --> 09:24.153
Probably should have
typed something else.

09:43.372 --> 09:48.034
I didn't win first place in that
burglary contest for nothing.

09:48.035 --> 09:50.495
Hee hee hee!

09:59.016 --> 10:00.856
Hey, Trish. Uh...

10:00.857 --> 10:03.388
I thought you were working
at the antique shop today.

10:03.389 --> 10:05.457
You gave me a money tree.

10:05.458 --> 10:07.354
I'm never working again.

10:07.355 --> 10:11.192
I bought the antique shop and now Mr.
Gower works for me.

10:11.193 --> 10:13.394
Finished your shopping,
Miss De La Rosa.

10:13.395 --> 10:16.530
Here's your smoothie and
your diamond tiara.

10:16.531 --> 10:18.432
Thanks.

10:18.433 --> 10:21.202
Here, buy yourself
something pretty.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.203
Uh, this is a leaf.

10:25.273 --> 10:30.013
Well, I'm gonna go work
on my short story.

10:30.145 --> 10:34.345
Uh, what happened
to the grand piano?

10:34.349 --> 10:38.489
- A giant elephant crushed it.
- Oh.

10:38.520 --> 10:41.150
I love gardening.

10:41.151 --> 10:42.936
Ah!

10:42.937 --> 10:44.737
Ah!

10:46.091 --> 10:47.319
Ah!

10:47.320 --> 10:48.556
Ah!

10:48.557 --> 10:50.397
My typewriter's gone!
Chuck stole it!

10:50.398 --> 10:54.368
- How do you know it was him?
- I found this boot spur on the floor.

10:54.369 --> 10:59.817
Okay, let's not panic. I'm sure he
doesn't know it's a magic typewriter.

10:59.818 --> 11:01.618
Ah!

11:02.444 --> 11:05.084
Okay, he knows.

11:06.414 --> 11:08.282
Chuck is making my
life miserable.

11:08.283 --> 11:13.254
Every time I order a churro
it turns into a stick.

11:13.255 --> 11:16.457
He's messing with us too.
Look at our hair!

11:16.458 --> 11:18.259
It's worse than that.

11:18.260 --> 11:22.285
My money tree died and Chuck gave the
antique store back to Mr. Gower.

11:22.286 --> 11:23.996
He's my boss again!

11:23.997 --> 11:29.157
I can't dance anymore! I
lost all my cool moves.

11:29.571 --> 11:33.651
Uh-oh. I hope I
didn't lose mine.

11:34.965 --> 11:37.905
Whew, still got it.

11:38.180 --> 11:40.454
We have to get that
typewriter back!

11:40.455 --> 11:42.778
Howdy, pardners.

11:42.779 --> 11:45.286
Give me back my
typewriter, Chuck!

11:45.287 --> 11:46.897
Typewriter?

11:46.898 --> 11:50.802
I'm using a computer that fits
right on the top of my lap.

11:50.803 --> 11:55.429
I'm currently writing the winning
short story with superior wordplay.

11:55.430 --> 11:57.598
"Chuck was pleased by
the paranoia displayed

11:57.599 --> 12:01.468
by Dez-perado and his
purple-haired posse".

12:01.469 --> 12:04.355
That is pretty good wordplay.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.476
We know you stole Dez's
typewriter, chuckles.

12:07.477 --> 12:11.691
Do you know the skills it would take
to break into a second-story window...

12:11.692 --> 12:15.111
Steal a typewriter, then
descend a 20-foot ladder,

12:15.112 --> 12:19.253
one-handed while holding
said typewriter?

12:19.254 --> 12:23.096
While I possess such
skills, I didn't do it.

12:23.097 --> 12:26.424
We found your spur in the practice
room and we're prepared to use it.

12:26.425 --> 12:29.845
Easy there, Trish-alicious.

12:30.199 --> 12:32.466
I'm not saying I
have the typewriter,

12:32.467 --> 12:36.270
but if I did, I'd use it to
make all your lives miserable.

12:36.271 --> 12:39.899
There's nothing you can
type that we can't handle.

12:39.900 --> 12:42.014
I know one thing I can't handle.

12:42.015 --> 12:43.983
Taking care of
another money tree.

12:43.984 --> 12:47.492
Those things are so much work.

12:47.493 --> 12:50.876
- You're not getting your money tree back.
- Aw, man.

12:50.877 --> 12:54.698
Let's get out of here. He doesn't
have the typewriter with him.

12:54.699 --> 12:57.744
Listen up, Chuck, I'm gonna
make your life worrisome by

12:57.745 --> 13:01.062
winning the contest with my wild,
witty and wondrous writing.

13:01.063 --> 13:05.683
Oh yeah, I'm pretty
good at wordplay too.

13:09.933 --> 13:13.663
Hey, our hair's back to normal. You
think Chuck is done messing with us?

13:13.664 --> 13:16.098
He's probably just tricking
us into a false sense of

13:16.099 --> 13:18.761
security before he does
something really horrible.

13:18.762 --> 13:23.502
What is the worst thing
he could do to us?

13:23.962 --> 13:28.046
Whoa, I feel weird.
What just happened?

13:28.047 --> 13:30.834
You're always weird, you doof.

13:30.835 --> 13:33.010
What else is new?

13:33.011 --> 13:36.387
Ally, why is Trish's voice
coming out of your body?

13:36.388 --> 13:40.707
Austin, why is Dez's voice
coming out of your body?

13:40.708 --> 13:44.905
Uh, because I'm Dez! Ah! I'm
trapped in Austin's body!

13:44.906 --> 13:48.938
And I'm Trish! We're all trapped
in each other's bodies!

13:48.939 --> 13:52.024
Chuck made us switch bodies?

13:52.025 --> 13:53.802
Ah!

13:53.803 --> 13:55.603
Ah!

13:55.628 --> 13:57.428
Ah!

14:04.175 --> 14:08.111
I can't believe Chuck used the magic
typewriter to switch our bodies.

14:08.112 --> 14:11.668
I say we string the little twerp up by
his boots and beat him like a pinata!

14:11.669 --> 14:13.770
Ally, what's gotten into you?

14:13.771 --> 14:16.276
Oh right, Trish has
gotten into you.

14:16.277 --> 14:21.124
We need to switch back. I
can't live in Austin's body!

14:21.125 --> 14:24.005
Okay, maybe I can.

14:28.132 --> 14:30.756
I'm Austin. 'Sup.

14:30.757 --> 14:34.597
They call me the love whisperer.

14:34.949 --> 14:37.453
He's not Austin Moon.

14:37.454 --> 14:39.771
I'm Austin Moon.

14:39.772 --> 14:42.996
<i>Don't look down down down down.</i>

14:42.997 --> 14:45.877
<i>Don't look down...</i>

14:47.928 --> 14:51.288
Okay, I'm not used to
being in this body.

14:51.289 --> 14:53.177
Maybe next time you
should sing...

14:53.178 --> 14:56.838
"I fall down down down down".

14:56.886 --> 14:59.286
Am I right?

14:59.530 --> 15:02.850
Yeah, I'm not gonna
high five you for that.

15:02.851 --> 15:05.302
I can't even get a
high five from myself.

15:05.303 --> 15:07.703
Am I right?

15:10.984 --> 15:14.203
Hey, honey. Figured out what you're
gonna say at my award ceremony yet?

15:14.204 --> 15:16.780
Yeah, I wrote a really
great speech, dad.

15:16.781 --> 15:20.550
- Did you just call me dad?
- She's just messing around.

15:20.551 --> 15:25.771
You know Trish... smart,
sassy, always making jokes.

15:26.214 --> 15:28.425
Why are your voices like that?

15:28.426 --> 15:30.694
Austin, what's going
on with the girls?

15:30.695 --> 15:32.762
It's kinda hard to explain.

15:32.763 --> 15:35.765
- I was talking to Austin.
- I am Austin.

15:35.766 --> 15:39.436
- I'm Dez!
- Dad, we can explain.

15:39.437 --> 15:43.440
Guess who's trapped
in Ally's body?

15:43.441 --> 15:46.954
Chuck stole Dez's magic typewriter
and made us all switch bodies.

15:46.955 --> 15:50.093
Oh, a magic typewriter?
It makes so much sense.

15:50.094 --> 15:52.011
And I thought I was
losing my mind.

15:52.012 --> 15:55.454
I know it's hard to
understand, but...

15:55.455 --> 15:58.612
Wait a sec. I'm Trish again! Oh.

15:58.613 --> 16:01.760
Hey, that's great.
I'm Austin again!

16:01.761 --> 16:04.594
I'm just so glad
everything's back to normal.

16:04.595 --> 16:06.422
I love you, dad.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.813
Ah!

16:07.814 --> 16:09.316
Dad, come back!

16:09.317 --> 16:12.017
Bye, Mr. Dawson!

16:12.138 --> 16:16.374
You know, I'm not entirely sure
everything is back to normal.

16:16.375 --> 16:20.180
We've gotta get that typewriter back
before Chuck makes this any worse.

16:20.181 --> 16:22.763
How can it get any worse
than switching bodies?

16:22.764 --> 16:26.664
Oh hey, my voice is back! Wahoo!

16:34.326 --> 16:37.148
Chuck, we've come to get
the typewriter back.

16:37.149 --> 16:39.993
Take one more step and I'll
turn you into a cactus.

16:39.994 --> 16:43.178
Give us back the typewriter or
I'm gonna make you regret it.

16:43.179 --> 16:46.220
You'd never do anything to me.

16:46.221 --> 16:49.084
You find me... irresistible.

16:49.085 --> 16:53.165
Irresistible? I find
you extremely...

16:53.201 --> 16:55.361
Adorable.

16:56.459 --> 17:01.139
What are you talking about, Trish?
He's a thief...

17:01.140 --> 17:04.079
Who stole my heart.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.486
I can't believe he's using the
typewriter to get girls to like him!

17:07.487 --> 17:11.325
Yeah! I can't believe I
didn't think of that.

17:11.326 --> 17:15.576
You're so cute, kittens look at
pictures of you on the Internet.

17:15.577 --> 17:19.483
You're so cute, instead of
calling babies "cutie-pies"...

17:19.483 --> 17:21.384
They call 'em "Chuckie-pies".

17:21.385 --> 17:23.467
Back off, Ally. He's mine.

17:23.468 --> 17:27.239
- No, he's mine!
- Ladies, ladies.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.725
There's enough Chuckie-pie
to go around.

17:29.726 --> 17:32.846
Everyone gets a slice.

17:33.202 --> 17:35.620
Give it up, Chuck...

17:35.621 --> 17:38.356
I just said upchuck.

17:38.357 --> 17:40.896
I'll stop after one condition...

17:40.897 --> 17:43.528
- Dez apologizes.
- For what?

17:43.529 --> 17:47.825
For stealing my look. Cowboy
wasn't my first choice.

17:47.826 --> 17:52.986
Wacky pants and silly
shirts used to be my thing.

17:53.472 --> 17:54.987
See?

17:54.988 --> 17:57.279
So you're saying that
if I just apologize,

17:57.280 --> 18:00.514
you'll stop messing with us, we can
go back to living our normal lives?

18:00.515 --> 18:03.699
Yup. All you gotta do is
say two simple words...

18:03.700 --> 18:05.451
"I'm sorry".

18:05.452 --> 18:09.292
Well then, I guess I'm sorry...

18:09.455 --> 18:12.423
That I'm never ever
gonna apologize to you!

18:12.424 --> 18:14.559
- Dez!
- Sorry, Austin.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.721
It's a matter of principle.
I can't apologize to him.

18:17.722 --> 18:22.193
I don't care if he does
turn me into a cactus...

18:22.194 --> 18:24.894
Or a goldfish...

18:26.078 --> 18:29.300
Or Ally's dad wearing
a chicken outfit...

18:29.301 --> 18:31.387
Or one of those
dinosaurs with the...

18:31.388 --> 18:34.868
Dez, stop giving him ideas!

18:37.498 --> 18:39.415
You had your chance, Red.

18:39.416 --> 18:42.092
It's about to get uglier
for you and your friends.

18:42.093 --> 18:45.718
You are so cute when
you're threatening us.

18:45.719 --> 18:47.639
Boop!

18:47.689 --> 18:49.690
Leave my friends out of it!

18:49.691 --> 18:52.626
Ally has to give a speech for her
dad, Austin has a driver's test...

18:52.627 --> 18:54.628
Believe me, they have
enough to worry about.

18:54.629 --> 18:57.565
- Dez, seriously, stop talking.
- He's not gonna do anything,

18:57.566 --> 19:02.170
- because we're gonna stop him first!
- "Chuck disappears!"

19:02.171 --> 19:03.971
Oh.

19:04.835 --> 19:06.142
Oh oh!

19:06.143 --> 19:09.025
Did he really just
leave the typewriter?

19:09.026 --> 19:13.167
I meant... "Chuck disappears
with the typewriter".

19:13.168 --> 19:16.228
- Ah.
- Oh, come on!

19:21.389 --> 19:25.091
Although he's never bought anything from
any of the other stores in the Mall,

19:25.092 --> 19:27.695
- Lester Dawson represents...
- There's no sign of Chuck anywhere.

19:27.696 --> 19:29.887
Hurry up and give your speech
before anything happens.

19:29.888 --> 19:34.748
With no further ado,
Lester Dawson's daughter.

19:38.163 --> 19:42.123
Hello, everybody.
I'm Ally Dawson.

19:48.139 --> 19:51.919
I'm Abraham Lincoln, aren't I?

19:57.015 --> 19:59.056
- Let's begin.
- Got it.

19:59.057 --> 20:03.717
I'll just put my hands at
the 10 and two position.

20:03.718 --> 20:09.286
Mr. Moon! Are you aware that you have
hooves where your hands should be?

20:09.287 --> 20:15.187
I can still drive. Nothing's gonna stop
me from getting my driver's license.

20:16.770 --> 20:20.739
Uh, can you start
the car for me?

20:20.740 --> 20:24.762
Four score and seven years ago,
give or take a few scores,

20:24.763 --> 20:27.960
my father opened Sonic Boom...

20:27.961 --> 20:31.650
You've gotta stop this! Go
apologize to Chuck now.

20:31.651 --> 20:37.291
Oh! Fine. I guess it's the
only way to make this stop.

20:38.814 --> 20:41.334
Everybody run!

20:48.016 --> 20:49.862
Huh.

20:49.863 --> 20:54.843
I guess it is kinda hard
to drive with hooves.

20:57.207 --> 20:59.427
My store!

20:59.746 --> 21:02.746
It'll be okay, dad.

21:02.749 --> 21:05.329
The typewriter!

21:07.438 --> 21:10.468
I'm still gonna win that
short story contest.

21:10.469 --> 21:13.038
Don't think so!

21:13.039 --> 21:18.079
Chuck, your story's about
to get a lot shorter.

21:18.919 --> 21:21.859
Man, you shrunk me!

21:24.347 --> 21:25.859
This isn't over!

21:25.860 --> 21:28.610
Now you're kind of adorable.

21:28.611 --> 21:31.880
I knew you'd come around.

21:31.881 --> 21:35.684
"And so our hero Dez
saved the day".

21:35.685 --> 21:37.906
"A whole bunch of
cheerleaders thanked him by

21:37.907 --> 21:43.247
showering him with hugs and
meat-lover's sandwiches".

21:44.962 --> 21:50.833
"And so Dez and the other cheerleaders
lived happily ever after".

21:50.834 --> 21:53.054
The end".

21:55.302 --> 21:58.546
That was an interesting story.

21:58.547 --> 22:01.944
The whole magic typewriter
and the money tree?

22:01.945 --> 22:03.993
I wish.

22:03.994 --> 22:05.974
It was a good story,
but a little unreal.

22:05.975 --> 22:11.451
I mean I wouldn't need a magic
typewriter to get a cheerleader.

22:11.452 --> 22:13.531
I'm Austin. 'Sup.

22:13.532 --> 22:16.261
I have a boyfriend.

22:16.262 --> 22:19.142
Let's go, darlin'.

22:20.271 --> 22:24.231
It could've been
you, Trishy-poo.

22:30.959 --> 22:35.346
And that's how I won first place in
the short story writing contest.

22:35.347 --> 22:40.028
And next week, I'm gonna win
the cake baking contest.

22:40.029 --> 22:42.849
Not so fast, Red.

22:45.086 --> 22:49.034
I'm gonna win because I
bake the sweetest cakes.

22:49.035 --> 22:54.120
Please. My cake's so sweet, you get
a cavity just by looking at it.

22:54.121 --> 22:55.460
Yeah?

22:55.461 --> 23:01.361
My cake's so sweet, my grandma wants to
squeeze its cheeks every time she sees it.

23:02.103 --> 23:03.679
My cake's so sweet,

23:03.680 --> 23:08.549
instead of having a "sweet 16" party,
girls have a "my cake 16" party.

23:08.550 --> 23:14.232
Well my cake is so sweet, instead of
having a "sweet 16" party's, girls have...

23:14.233 --> 23:17.718
My, my cake... "Sweet
16" party's...

23:17.719 --> 23:19.057
You already said that.

23:19.058 --> 23:22.186
Ha! Sweet, sweet victory.

23:22.187 --> 23:26.667
Or should I say my
cake, my cake victory?
