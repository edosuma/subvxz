Ah, you made it, Rodders. Good.
Well done, my son.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.720
You've got a bloody nerve, Del,
phoning me to come and pick you up!

01:26.120 --> 01:29.000
What could I do, Rodney?
What?

01:29.800 --> 01:33.760
Listen, I've got the Vauxhall Velox
outside, haven't I?

01:33.840 --> 01:36.720
And I've had a few drinky-poos.

01:36.840 --> 01:41.600
I thought, "Get a mini-cab."
Then I thought, "No, no."

01:41.680 --> 01:47.400
It's more impressive to get
your driver to drive you home

01:47.480 --> 01:51.360
in your Vexhall Vaulox...
Vauxhall Velox!

01:51.480 --> 01:54.320
Impressive?
Who are you trying to impress?

01:54.400 --> 01:58.040
Shh! A contact, Rodney. A contact.

01:58.120 --> 02:04.880
A new man in the area, stone rich,
and looking for "business opportunities".

02:05.880 --> 02:09.120
We could earn out of this, Rodney!

02:09.200 --> 02:14.560
Del, when you phoned,
I was in the flat with a friend.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.480
Why didn't you bring him with you?

02:16.560 --> 02:17.760
It wasn't a he!

02:17.840 --> 02:19.080
What was it, then?

02:20.760 --> 02:23.160
Have you been up to naughties?

02:23.240 --> 02:27.040
No, I just felt something
was going to develop.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.680
-You've been playing with my Polaroid!
-No!

02:32.040 --> 02:33.920
I'll just collect our coats, Derek.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.600
-No rush, Vimal, my old mucker!
-Who?

02:38.840 --> 02:41.800
Vimal. Vimal Malik.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.320
My contact.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.640
Say no more.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.520
He said, "She can't come now,
'cause she's weighing the postman!"

02:55.760 --> 03:02.360
'Ere, fancy a nightcap, Vimal?
I know a nice little pub
that does late tastings.

03:03.880 --> 03:07.120
Thought you'd given me the slip?

03:07.200 --> 03:10.920
Why don't you go away
and leave me alone?

03:11.000 --> 03:17.920
I have no quarrel with you, my friend.
It's this pig's behind, Malik,
that I wish to see!

03:19.080 --> 03:21.080
A friend of yours, Vimal?

03:21.640 --> 03:24.200
He's no-one's friend.

03:24.280 --> 03:28.920
I dunno what this is about
and I don't wanna know.

03:29.000 --> 03:34.280
So move before you get a smack
in the ear! All right?

03:34.360 --> 03:39.320
Please, don't threaten me with violence.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.960
My colleague here
is a Second Dan in karate.

03:44.280 --> 03:48.080
And I'm a black belt in origami.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.680

THUD

04:25.880 --> 04:27.840
Rodney, you and Vimal,
in the car, quick.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.440
Right. Let's go!

04:30.720 --> 04:35.720
It's been pleasant meeting you.
Have a nice evening, won't you?

04:35.840 --> 04:37.560
My friend...

04:37.640 --> 04:43.120
It's not good to part
in such circumstances. Can we talk?

04:43.320 --> 04:45.400
I've done all my talking.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.480
Goodnight, each!

04:52.840 --> 04:55.720
Rodney, I didn't mean drive off!

04:55.800 --> 04:58.600
What a plonker!

05:01.920 --> 05:06.600
Well, on second thoughts,
I quite fancy a nice little chat.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.680
Perhaps you could drop me off home after?

05:11.400 --> 05:12.880
Oh! Oh, dear.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
Come on, me old mate.
You'll be all right. All right.

Ah, I think your brother
has arrived, Mr Trotter.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.400
Eh? Excuse me a minute, Mr Ram.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.040
-Excuse me. Rodney...
-Del.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.400
I thought you was in bother!

05:49.480 --> 05:53.480
You took 90 minutes to come!
I phoned Grandad.

05:53.560 --> 06:00.000
He said,
"Del's been captured by Indians!"
I nearly phoned the Texas Rangers!

06:00.880 --> 06:07.080
If you were so worried,
how come it took till
12:40 to rescue me?

06:07.160 --> 06:13.000
Because you didn't tell Grandad
which Indian restaurant you was in!

06:13.080 --> 06:18.800
I've crashed into every curry house
from Battersea to Collier's Wood!

06:18.880 --> 06:25.200
I can leap out of that car,
<i>Dukes of Hazzard</i>-style, shouting in Urdu!

06:25.280 --> 06:26.760
All right, I forgive you, Rodney.

06:26.840 --> 06:30.720
-That's nice.
-Is there gonna be trouble?

06:30.800 --> 06:35.080
-No! Put the spoon down.
-Thank God!

06:35.160 --> 06:41.560
Come on. Rodney, I'd like you to meet
Mr Ram. He owns this restaurant.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.080
Of course, you know Oddjob!

06:44.880 --> 06:48.760
Nice restaurant, Mr Ram!
Very...eh...

06:48.840 --> 06:51.000
-Indian!
-Yeah, Indian.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.840
-Thank you.
-Sit down.

06:52.920 --> 06:57.040
I was telling your brother how well
I've done since I came to Britain.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.040
I now own 18 restaurants.

07:00.360 --> 07:02.720
I also own a lot of land.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.920
Yeah, Oddjob has a couple of acres!

07:06.720 --> 07:08.760
-Hey!
-That's a spoon!

07:08.920 --> 07:10.680
SPEAKS IN HINDI

07:12.720 --> 07:17.440
I tell you, if I got into my car
at 9 o'clock in the morning,

07:17.520 --> 07:21.640
it would take until 2:00
to drive round my land.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.440
We had a car like that once!

07:24.560 --> 07:26.760
-What?
-Oh, it don't matter.

07:26.840 --> 07:31.120
So, you and Vimal have had a bit
of an up and downer?

07:31.200 --> 07:35.040
Don't mention that name.
It will sour the food.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.640
What's it all about, then?

07:36.720 --> 07:39.360
I'll tell you, Mr Trotter.

07:39.440 --> 07:45.360
It's about truth, righteousness,
but, above all, it's about justice!

07:45.800 --> 07:48.800
Vimal...that pig's behind,

07:49.360 --> 07:52.960
has something
that is rightfully mine.

07:53.040 --> 08:00.000
Our families have been engaged
in a vendetta for many, many years,
going back to the old Empire.

08:00.640 --> 08:06.560
-British Empire, not the Kilburn!
-I know that! Pray continue.

08:06.920 --> 08:13.520
Now, my family fought
against the British,
whereas Malik's supported them.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.240
When the conquest of India
was complete,

08:17.320 --> 08:24.000
the British Raj rewarded the Maliks'
"loyalty" by giving them my family's land.

08:24.680 --> 08:28.840
-They took it off your family?
-That is correct.

08:28.920 --> 08:33.960
They destroyed the home, plundered
my family temple and sold the land!

08:34.960 --> 08:41.320
-They built a business empire
on the proceeds.
-Write to <i>That's Life?</i>

08:42.200 --> 08:44.160
<i>-That's Life? </i>
-Yeah.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.360
This was a century ago, Mr Trotter.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.840
If Lord Krishna couldn't help us,
Esther Rantzen hasn't much chance!

08:52.920 --> 08:55.720
Just a thought. Oi! Get off!

08:55.800 --> 09:02.160
Vimal Malik has in his possession
the one, single item
that remains of my birthright.

09:03.720 --> 09:09.680
It's a simple porcelain statuette
of Kuvera. You know of Kuvera?

09:09.760 --> 09:11.120
Yeah. Yeah.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.440
-You don't know who Kuvera is!
-Yes, I do!

09:17.520 --> 09:21.560
-All right, then, tell us.
-What?

09:21.640 --> 09:25.240
-Who is he?
-Who?

09:25.320 --> 09:31.280
-Kuvera!
-Oh! Well, er...he was...
All right, I don't know!

09:31.360 --> 09:36.280
Two 'O' Levels and he thinks
he is Bamber Gascoigne's vest!

09:36.360 --> 09:39.520
All right, Mastermind, who is he?

09:39.600 --> 09:43.720
Kuvera...was one of India's
premier wicket-keepers!

09:45.360 --> 09:46.840
You berk!

09:46.920 --> 09:52.840
Kuvera is the Hindu god of wealth,
from the Trimurti, the Trinity.

09:52.920 --> 09:57.080
Oh, that Kuvera! Gotcha now.
There's two of them.

09:57.160 --> 10:01.560
In wordly terms,
the statuette is of little value,

10:01.760 --> 10:08.400
but in religious terms it is
precious and I want it back.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.440
I am a rich man, Mr Trotter.

10:10.520 --> 10:15.640
I shouldn't stoop to the kind of
intimidation you saw tonight.

10:15.720 --> 10:21.200
I'm prepared to buy it back
from Malik. I would pay £4,000.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.040
F-f-four thousand pounds?

10:28.120 --> 10:31.000
Why not just make him an offer?

10:31.080 --> 10:38.040
Impossible! This caste system.
He's high caste and I am low caste.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.720
Don't put yourself down.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.280
We cannot meet, talk or communicate
in any manner.

10:43.360 --> 10:47.200
I am up a gum-tree
without a paddle!

10:48.920 --> 10:54.920
It seems to me, Mr Ram,
you need a mutual friend,
someone to act as a go-between.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.520
Perhaps you and your brother?

10:58.600 --> 11:04.040
What? Us?
Well, I suppose we could.

11:04.120 --> 11:09.200
-Why didn't we think of it, Rodney?
-I think one of us did, Del.

11:09.280 --> 11:15.000
If you helped me reclaim it,
I don't know how I'd reward you!

11:15.080 --> 11:20.320
I fancy a video recorder.
But, no, <i>pas de bas. Pas de bas.</i>

11:21.360 --> 11:27.280
We'll go and see this Mr Vimal
tomorrow. £4,000, you said, right?

11:27.360 --> 11:32.320
Right. Oh, but I must make
one thing quite clear.

11:33.080 --> 11:39.320
I don't trust Vimal Malik.
You see, he comes from
a long line of swindlers.

11:39.400 --> 11:45.680
I won't part with a single penny
until the statuette is in my hands.

11:46.880 --> 11:51.040
Don't worry, Mr Ram.
Me and Vimal are like that.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.080
Good job we didn't call the police...

11:58.120 --> 12:00.120
Oh! What happened?

12:02.640 --> 12:05.960
I'm surprised at you, Derek.
And you, Rodney.

12:06.040 --> 12:11.280
You ate with that gutter-dog?
I thought you were my friends.

12:11.360 --> 12:16.640
We are, Vimal, my old mucker!
Just trust me. Trust me.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.280
This Mr Ram, the gutter-dog,

12:20.360 --> 12:27.320
told us all about the little
misunderstanding your two families
have been having.

12:27.520 --> 12:32.040
He also mentioned the statue of some god.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.520
Kuvera, the god of wealth.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.680
That's him! That's the boy, yeah.

12:37.840 --> 12:43.320
Well, without beating around the bush,

12:43.400 --> 12:50.360
em, well...you know. I mean, well...
to cut a long story short,

12:50.560 --> 12:55.440
well...not to put too fine a point on it.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.080
He wants to buy it off you!

13:02.320 --> 13:08.440
Buy from me?
He must have gone mad or eaten
too many of his own curries!

13:08.520 --> 13:14.080
I wouldn't sell it to him
if he offered me a million pounds!

13:14.240 --> 13:16.920
How much did he offer?

13:17.040 --> 13:20.080
-£2,000.
-I thought Mr Ram...

13:20.160 --> 13:24.520
Yeah, £1,000, but I persuaded him
to double it.

13:24.600 --> 13:28.040
£2,000 ? No, I can't sell to him.

13:28.120 --> 13:33.080
£2,000, Vimal, my old mucker.
It's not to be sneezed at, eh?

13:33.280 --> 13:36.040
I won't deny I am tempted, Derek.

13:36.120 --> 13:41.160
I thought of selling it before,
but was offered only £150.

13:41.960 --> 13:48.000
Vimal, I get the impression that
you're not as rich and successful

13:48.360 --> 13:51.680
as you told me you were last night
at the Chamber of Trade bash.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.960
I mean, look at this place.
It's hardly The Ritz, is it?

13:56.040 --> 13:57.840
More like The Nits!

13:58.680 --> 14:03.360
I admit I have had some misfortunes
in my business dealings lately.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.400
So two grand would be dead handy?

14:06.480 --> 14:12.400
It would be "dead handy" as you say,
but I can't communicate with him.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.640
I am high caste and he is low caste.

14:14.720 --> 14:21.520
But you don't have to communicate
with him! That's where we come in,
we're the go-betweens!

14:21.800 --> 14:24.520
Even so, I cannot accept his offer.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.240
It would be betraying my family.

14:27.320 --> 14:31.720
It was left by my father.
Can you understand?

14:31.800 --> 14:35.680
-Yes. Eh, Rodney?
-Yeah?

14:35.760 --> 14:40.920
Our late mother,
well, she's dead now,

14:41.760 --> 14:48.040
she left us this family heirloom.
It was this...this...Victorian globe.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.640
It meant the world to us.

14:52.400 --> 14:59.080
Yes, it meant the world to us.
But then we fell upon stony ground.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.720
-Did we, Del?
-Yes, we did.

15:01.800 --> 15:07.640
And all we had of value was
this globe that we cherished.

15:07.720 --> 15:11.720
-You sold it?
-I raffled it.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.840
You understand the sense of loss.

15:13.920 --> 15:19.360
Not really, because luckily
Del had the winning ticket!

15:20.560 --> 15:24.880
-I think it was God or something.
-You think I should sell it to him?

15:24.960 --> 15:31.840
Of course, Vimal! What is it?
It's just an ancient piece
of old religious pottery!

15:31.920 --> 15:38.880
With £2,000 wisely invested,
in a couple of years you could
replace it with...

15:38.960 --> 15:42.920
a Capo Del Monte!
Couldn't you?

15:43.000 --> 15:49.000
And I've got to tell you,
I think that statue is cursed.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.840
-Cursed?
-Leave it out, Del.

15:51.920 --> 15:57.840
You underestimate the dark powers!
The god of wealth ain't helped him!

15:58.920 --> 16:05.880
I am not superstitious, but I am
a business man and a realist.
I will accept his offer.

16:06.360 --> 16:11.920
You know it makes sense, Vimal.
I'll fetch the statue. Good man.

16:15.440 --> 16:17.160
-What the?
-Excuse me.

16:17.240 --> 16:18.360
DEL: Certainly.

16:20.160 --> 16:24.040
What is your game, Del?
How come you only offered £2,000 ?

16:24.120 --> 16:25.680
Slip of the tongue.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.880
So I can tell him the truth?

16:27.960 --> 16:32.720
-No! He'll think it's a con!
-It is!

16:32.800 --> 16:34.400
No man is an island, Rodney.

16:34.480 --> 16:39.480
I know that! What I mean is...
What does that mean?

16:39.560 --> 16:46.040
Well, the French have a saying, Rodney.
<i>"Bouillabaisse, mon ami."</i>

16:46.480 --> 16:51.160
<i>Bouillabaisse, mon ami?</i>
That means, "Fish stew, my friend!"

16:51.600 --> 16:53.080
Need I say more?

16:53.160 --> 16:57.960
Don't fob me off!
You're trying to con him out of £2,000!

16:58.040 --> 17:00.840
-We'll get lumbered!
-How?

17:00.920 --> 17:03.800
Say they meet and discuss the deal?

17:03.880 --> 17:10.600
That's the beauty! They can't meet
because of the caste system!
It's Christmas come early for us!

17:10.680 --> 17:16.040
Without us, Vimal gets nothing!

17:16.120 --> 17:19.800
£2,000 is better than a kick
up the bot from Bobby Charlton!

17:20.200 --> 17:23.480
-It's immoral
-Free enterprise!

17:23.560 --> 17:24.920
It's illegal!

17:25.000 --> 17:29.480
All right, but you and I can earn
£1,000 a piece out of this.

17:30.320 --> 17:33.000
-It's fraud!
-Are you in?

17:33.080 --> 17:35.160
Yeah, all right.

17:39.640 --> 17:44.880
Ah! Oh! Well, this is it, is it,
Vimal, my old mucker?

17:45.960 --> 17:50.920
Lovely! That is lovely, that.
Wonderful workmanship.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.160
Of course, I'm a Ming fan myself.

17:54.240 --> 17:59.000
He made some wonderful stuff, Ming.
Pity he died when he did.

17:59.080 --> 18:04.560
-Ming was a dynasty.
-I don't care what he was,
he made great vases!

18:04.640 --> 18:11.640
We'll take this to Mr Ram
and bring your £2,000 post haste,
as they say in Ancient Rome.

18:11.720 --> 18:16.480
No, no, Derek. This does not leave
my sight until I see his money.

18:16.560 --> 18:21.360
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand, you see.

18:21.440 --> 18:26.920
He won't give you a penny
until the statue is in his hands.

18:27.080 --> 18:32.760
I don't care. I don't trust him.
He comes from a long line of cheats.

18:32.840 --> 18:36.600
Bring his money, then take this.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.160
No, you see, he said,

18:40.240 --> 18:44.680
"Bring me the statue"
and then you can have the money.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.560
-I don't care, Derek.
-He don't care.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.720
I heard him!

18:49.800 --> 18:52.720
-I'll leave Rodney as a deposit.
-Eh?

18:52.800 --> 18:54.800
What else can I do?

18:54.920 --> 19:00.800
He won't let go without the money
and he won't get the money until...
Gordon Bennett!

19:02.000 --> 19:06.360
This is classic!
The bacon and the egg situation!

19:06.440 --> 19:09.200
-Chicken and egg.
-Forget food!

19:09.760 --> 19:15.840
Talk to him, Derek.
Persuade him to submit to my terms.
You have influence over him.

19:15.920 --> 19:20.120
You have already persuaded him
to double his offer to £2,000.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.720
Yeah, that's right.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.920
I'll see what I can do, shall I ?

19:26.000 --> 19:30.160
I'll get back to you, all right?

19:30.240 --> 19:35.080
You, you know, stay loose.
Okay? Come on.

19:35.800 --> 19:40.840
And don't you worry, Vimal.
Me and old Ram are like...like...

19:40.920 --> 19:44.800
We're like that. Yeah.
Thanks.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.840
What are we gonna do now?

19:49.920 --> 19:52.640
-Forget it, Del.
-How can we?

19:52.720 --> 19:57.520
£2,000 up for grabs? No, no.
There's got to be another way.

19:57.600 --> 20:04.320
There isn't. Ram won't pay a penny
until he's got the statuette
and Vimal wants the money first.

20:04.400 --> 20:09.080
Yeah, cheers.
Or what he thinks is Ram's money.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.760
What are you on about now?

20:11.840 --> 20:18.320
Say we had £2,000 lying around
doing nothing in particular.

20:18.400 --> 20:22.040
-Just mooching about?
-Kicking its heels.

20:22.120 --> 20:26.120
Let's say we gave Vimal that £2,000

20:26.200 --> 20:29.760
and pretended we had
just collected it from Mr Ram.

20:29.840 --> 20:34.240
Vimal would think that he'd won
the battle

20:34.320 --> 20:37.440
and would hand over the statuette,

20:37.520 --> 20:43.680
which we'd whip round to Mr Ram,
who'll think that he's won

20:43.760 --> 20:46.920
and be equally chuffed as a sandboy,

20:47.000 --> 20:51.960
and he'll hand over to us
4,000 lovely smackeroonios!

20:52.040 --> 20:56.920
We would get on our bike,
leaving them to play sandcastles!

20:57.760 --> 21:01.160
-Brilliant, eh?
-Only one problem.

21:01.240 --> 21:04.000
How the hell do we get £2,000?

21:05.000 --> 21:07.960
You always bring up little details.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.480
-We'll go to a bank!
-Rob it?

21:10.560 --> 21:11.880
-Hmm!
-Oi!

21:11.960 --> 21:15.400
We'll borrow it.
This is gilt-edged security!

21:15.480 --> 21:21.640
You can't borrow money
to pull off a con trick!
And we've no bank account.

21:22.640 --> 21:26.280
There's got to be another way!

21:29.240 --> 21:32.160
-'Ere, we're general traders.
-Yeah.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.760
Well, why don't we start
trading generally?

21:34.840 --> 21:41.680
-We could flog all the stock
in the garage. The deep freeze...
-Three-wheel van?

21:41.760 --> 21:44.640
They'd want a tenner to take it!

21:44.720 --> 21:51.640
There's Grandad's telly...
We could flog my jewellery, it's 27 carat.

21:52.440 --> 21:58.440
-I thought it was 9.
-When I was buying. Now I'm selling.
There's that leather coat.

21:59.240 --> 22:05.160
-Not my coat?
-No... Have you got one?
That'll do too, Rodney!

22:05.240 --> 22:07.640
Del, we'll never raise two grand!

22:07.720 --> 22:11.640
We can! You can do anything
if you want it hard enough.

22:11.720 --> 22:17.240
-We can do it, Rodney! We can do it!
-Yeah... Yeah!

22:17.320 --> 22:19.200
Come on, then!

23:33.520 --> 23:38.240
Well, thanks a lot.
It's...tempus fugit, eh?

23:38.320 --> 23:39.880
Where's your watch?

23:39.960 --> 23:44.360
I broke it last night playing volleyball.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.200
I thought you were right-handed?

23:46.280 --> 23:49.680
Me? No, no. I'm ambiguous.

23:54.720 --> 24:00.480
Hey! Rodders!
What about that, my son? Here I...

24:23.080 --> 24:24.320
CLEARS THROAT

24:24.640 --> 24:27.640
Good afternoon. A table for two?

24:27.720 --> 24:29.320
-No, thank you.
-No?

24:29.400 --> 24:31.320
We'd like to see Mr Ram.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.840
-Mr Ram?
-The owner.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.000
-The owner?
-Terrible echo in here, Rodney.

24:36.840 --> 24:40.080
-We'd like to speak to the owner, Mr Ram.
-Ram?

24:40.160 --> 24:42.080
There it goes again!

24:42.240 --> 24:48.880
Listen, we would like to talk to
the proprietor of this restaurant.

24:48.960 --> 24:52.720
-I am the proprietor.
-No, no.

24:53.520 --> 24:58.200
-We want to see the real owner.
-I am the "real owner"!

24:58.280 --> 25:02.840
All right, listen. Hang about.
Just watch my lips.

25:03.200 --> 25:07.160
Where is Mr Ram ? Right?

25:07.240 --> 25:12.560
I don't know this Mr bloody Ram.
You drunks always cause trouble!

25:12.640 --> 25:14.840
We're not drunks!

25:15.240 --> 25:19.120
I'd a meal here recently. Remember?

25:19.200 --> 25:21.960
Sorry. You all look alike to me.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.720
'Ere, what's he talking about?

25:25.800 --> 25:27.680
He don't know. He's making it up.

25:27.760 --> 25:31.160
-Look, my brother, right?
-Me!

25:31.240 --> 25:36.200
He was in dining with a couple
of Indian gentlemen, right?

25:36.720 --> 25:41.000
One was sort of large,
large and aggressive, right? Big?

25:41.680 --> 25:43.760
One was small... Right?

25:43.840 --> 25:46.880
Smaller than that. Get down!

25:46.960 --> 25:48.200
More business-like.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.440
-He had a beard.
-A beard!

25:50.520 --> 25:53.800
-Oh, that Mr Ram!
-Yes! Yes!

25:54.280 --> 25:57.760
I know who you are talking about.

25:57.840 --> 26:01.240
He's the one who gave me
a bouncy cheque!

26:01.560 --> 26:07.000
I went to the address on the back
of the cheque and he had scarpered!

26:08.560 --> 26:09.680
Del Boy...

26:09.760 --> 26:14.960
No, no, no, no...this can't...
There's got to be a mistake.

26:15.040 --> 26:18.520
He said he owned 18 restaurants!

26:18.600 --> 26:20.840
Maybe he was fibbing?

26:21.360 --> 26:25.960
F-fibbing? Maybe he was fibbing?

26:26.040 --> 26:30.840
I gave him £2,000 for this
on the strength of him fibbing!

26:30.920 --> 26:36.760
£2,000? But, why? You can get them
in Portobello Road for £17 each.

26:40.560 --> 26:43.440
It's amazing what you can save
if you shop around!

26:47.280 --> 26:50.800
I've got a nose-bleed coming, Rodney!

26:54.240 --> 26:57.880
He tried to tell me
that the statue was cursed!

26:58.800 --> 27:04.320
He told me that he thought Kuvera
was a wicket-keeper!

27:07.640 --> 27:12.120
Let's see, we've done Cardiff,
Bristol, Southampton

27:12.200 --> 27:14.840
and now north and south London.
Where next?

27:14.920 --> 27:21.200
Oh, Birmingham, then Manchester
and Newcastle, maybe Liverpool.

27:21.280 --> 27:27.120
Wherever people are ready to exploit
the religious bigotry
of two stupid immigrants!

27:27.560 --> 27:29.920
We'll be very rich, my friend!

27:30.000 --> 27:33.320
I'll drink to that, my old mucker!

27:56.320 --> 27:57.960
No sign of Vimal?

27:58.040 --> 28:03.120
No, he had it away on his toes
five minutes after we left!

28:03.880 --> 28:08.600
As Macbeth said to Hamlet
in <i>Midsummer Night's Dream,</i>

28:09.440 --> 28:11.960
"We've been done up like kippers!"

28:12.040 --> 28:17.280
-Right. Let's go to the police.
-Good idea. Give them a laugh.

28:17.360 --> 28:23.120
Imagine it: Trotter brothers conned out
of two grand.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.600
We'd never be able to
hold our heads up in court again!

28:27.360 --> 28:32.080
I don't know how people like Vimal
and his mate can sleep at night.

28:33.400 --> 28:38.160
We've lost everything, leather coats,
the Vauxhall, Grandad's TV.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.560
Del, he was renting that telly!

28:42.160 --> 28:44.360
Oh, terrific.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.680
Let's get something to eat.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.440
I always feel emotionally peckish
when I've been gutted!

28:53.480 --> 28:56.680
We could get a curry.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.320
Only joking! Del.
