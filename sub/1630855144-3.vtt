WEBVTT

00:08.508 --> 00:13.763
It seems we've the very
thing we tried to prevent--

00:13.763 --> 00:17.767
Unicorn has awakened
once more.

00:17.767 --> 00:21.271
Bit perhaps
all is not lost--

00:21.271 --> 00:25.442
for they are not
the way they were in the past,

00:25.442 --> 00:30.488
and this resurrection
might be their last.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.615
All of you!

01:39.307 --> 01:41.810
Priceless artifacts
stolen!

01:41.810 --> 01:43.353
Read all about it!

01:43.353 --> 01:46.689
Get your news chronicled
Otto-matically!

01:46.689 --> 01:49.567
Scotland Yard
investigates!

01:51.528 --> 01:53.029
Inspector,
any arrests been made?

01:53.029 --> 01:54.239
A prime suspect?

01:56.449 --> 01:59.202
What we have here
is an act of piracy.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.037
And an investigation
is underway.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.622
- Inspector!
- What about witnesses?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.874
All I can say is that
there have been some injuries,

02:04.874 --> 02:09.087
and artifacts bound for the
British Museum have been stolen.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.713
That is all.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.298
What about witness reports
of something supernatural?

02:12.298 --> 02:14.425
There is no such thing
as the supernatural!

02:14.425 --> 02:16.636
Reporter #2:
What about that zombie elephant
from the other night?

02:16.636 --> 02:18.596
It-It escaped
from the zoo!

02:18.596 --> 02:19.848
And the witch's magic?

02:19.848 --> 02:22.267
Over 50 eyewitnesses
saw her!

02:22.267 --> 02:23.560
She took out
the whole block!

02:23.560 --> 02:24.727
There was
a gas explosion!

02:24.727 --> 02:26.271
Is this supernatural
boat attack

02:26.271 --> 02:27.480
connected to
the zombie elephant?

02:27.480 --> 02:30.066
"Wave of Magic Terror
Grips London!"

02:30.066 --> 02:32.527
Magic is not real!

02:32.527 --> 02:35.738
And yes,
we feel there is a connection,

02:35.738 --> 02:39.742
but it's nothing more than a
criminal gang of spiritualists.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.286
They use
parlor tricks--

02:41.286 --> 02:45.373
lights, shadows, flash powder,
or other such gimmicks,

02:45.373 --> 02:46.875
like the other night,

02:46.875 --> 02:51.170
to deceive honest people
into believing they are magic.

02:51.170 --> 02:54.340
And Scotland Yard
will not rest

02:54.340 --> 02:57.677
until these charlatans
are in custody.

03:05.476 --> 03:10.231
You're under arrest.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.801
"Spiritualists raided!

03:38.801 --> 03:40.845
Manhunt underway!"

03:40.845 --> 03:43.514
Reward offered for any
information leading to

03:43.514 --> 03:46.476
the capture of
the Magic Marauders!

03:58.905 --> 04:00.907
Where are you,
my love?

04:08.498 --> 04:10.833
Seng, do you see
anything?

04:10.833 --> 04:12.877
Ooh.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.337
You found her?

04:24.305 --> 04:27.058
I see...

04:27.058 --> 04:29.227
the cosmic walker!

04:33.314 --> 04:36.150
Never can I recall an awakening
where so much is lost.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.823
Yes, even your awakening
is shrouded in mystery.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.367
Metal men, zombie elephants,
Melinda lost...

04:44.367 --> 04:45.660
I just...

04:46.869 --> 04:48.663
What have you done!?

04:54.168 --> 04:57.338
You will not succeed.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.315
Emma. Emma.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.733
You big dum-dum.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.276
What are you doing
sneaking about?

06:00.276 --> 06:04.614
I'm a thief, here to steal
your most prized possession.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.449
And what might
that be?

06:06.449 --> 06:08.743
Your heart.
m'lady.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.411
Well,
that's just silly.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.621
You already
have that.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.664
A kiss, then?

06:13.664 --> 06:15.917
Well, Mummy, Daddy?

06:20.254 --> 06:22.256
What do you think?

06:22.256 --> 06:25.384
- Stunning.
- What?

06:27.595 --> 06:29.847
Who are you?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.853
What is happening?

07:12.723 --> 07:15.935
I'll have them serve us
in here tonight.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.436
This is...

07:17.436 --> 07:19.564
too much for me to bear.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.732
Please rest easy, darling.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.402
What will we do,
Fairfax?

07:24.402 --> 07:27.071
Our daughter is gone.

07:27.071 --> 07:30.366
We-- We don't even know
if she's alive.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.368
Oh, she's alive.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.703
I know it.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.454
We will find her.

07:35.454 --> 07:38.040
And poor Winston.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.208
Winston!

07:39.208 --> 07:43.045
At his young age,
to ponder death is--

07:43.045 --> 07:44.046
Death?

07:44.046 --> 07:45.214
Emma!

07:45.214 --> 07:46.716
Winston is dead?!

07:46.716 --> 07:49.385
Tell me!
Is he dead?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.928
No! No, darling.

07:50.928 --> 07:55.266
He's at Royal Victoria Hospital,
very much alive.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.726
He's a strong chap,

07:56.726 --> 07:58.853
and has the best doctors
in London.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.188
He will be fine.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.356
No.
This is my fault.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.567
I have to see him.

08:04.567 --> 08:05.985
Emma, wait.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.486
Oh, you mustn't go.

08:07.486 --> 08:09.655
We can fix whatever this is
that's happened.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.282
I assure you.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.577
Just know that you are
Emma Fairfax, our daughter.

08:14.577 --> 08:19.332
Your place is here,
at home, with us.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.340
Thank goodness
she is alive.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.591
Is she?

08:28.591 --> 08:30.092
Fairfax!

08:30.092 --> 08:31.344
It's just...

08:31.344 --> 08:35.264
that is not
our daughter.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.838
Pardon, Miss.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.633
Scratch an itch,
would ya, Miss?

09:10.633 --> 09:13.678
Don't bother
the young lady.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.973
I see her,
floating in the air.

09:16.973 --> 09:20.935
Poor lad-- keeps re-living
that horrible day.

09:20.935 --> 09:23.896
Oh, no!
The fire!

09:23.896 --> 09:25.231
The fire!

09:25.231 --> 09:26.691
I have to
get out of here.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.067
Emma?

09:28.067 --> 09:29.277
Winston?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.820
I can't believe
it's you.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.905
Why didn't you leave
when I told you to go?

09:32.905 --> 09:34.282
You could have
been killed.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.951
I couldn't leave you.
You are my everything.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.828
Right, Romeo.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.498
Don't wanna bust them stitches
on account of your pretty...

09:42.498 --> 09:45.459
lady.

09:45.459 --> 09:47.670
Now, now,
take it easy.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.380
I'll be back to change
them bandages--

09:49.380 --> 09:52.925
and I'll get some-- some
fresh ones from-from over there,

09:52.925 --> 09:54.427
where-- where
the supply is, yeah?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.262
I won't let you
go again.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.513
No.

09:57.513 --> 09:58.806
It was a mistake
to come here.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.058
Emma, just listen
to me...

10:03.144 --> 10:04.228
I have to leave.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.813
No.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.857
I will never
let you go.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.317
Gotcha!

10:27.835 --> 10:29.712
Hello, there.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.298
Aren't you cute.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.591
Huh?

10:33.591 --> 10:36.218
A nine-tailed fox?

10:39.221 --> 10:40.431
Melinda!

10:40.431 --> 10:44.644
Sorry, little friend,
I have to go.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.022
I found her!
I found her!

10:48.022 --> 10:50.566
This way!
- Don't lose her!

10:50.566 --> 10:54.111
Why can't I move?

10:54.111 --> 10:55.404
Who's that?

10:55.404 --> 10:58.532
You guide the way,
and we'll guide you.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.534
- She's on the move!
- On it!

11:13.172 --> 11:14.423
The three-eyed dog
is loose!

11:29.397 --> 11:30.773
Next.

11:35.694 --> 11:39.573
Clarice Leydoux
and Lao Xi Sheng.

11:41.367 --> 11:44.203
Says here you have
some important information

11:44.203 --> 11:46.872
regarding
the spiritualist gang.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.207
They are not
a gang.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.043
They are heroes fighting
on the side of good.

11:51.043 --> 11:54.839
You see, we are part of a legacy
that has saved the world

11:54.839 --> 11:58.926
from an unspeakable evil
throughout time.

11:58.926 --> 12:02.221
We are members of
The Reawakened.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.015
The heroes you seek
are actually spirits

12:05.015 --> 12:08.519
reborn to fight evil
time and time again.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.689
A long line of people
become host to these spirits.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.275
Our ancestors were
some of these people.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.820
My 3rd-generation grandfather
was chosen long ago,

12:17.820 --> 12:20.156
and now,
I await my call.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.909
And I am a direct descendant
of Sainte-GeneviÃ¨ve,

12:23.909 --> 12:27.788
protector of Paris,
and one of the first hosts.

12:27.788 --> 12:32.042
This call is what I have
trained for all of my life.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.879
We both have.

12:34.879 --> 12:40.426
So, what you are saying
is that the heroes are here...

12:40.426 --> 12:42.595
just not awakened
in you.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.640
You didn't get chosen.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.351
Something clearly
has gone wrong.

12:49.351 --> 12:50.769
Clearly.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.814
You know, I've heard a lot of
crazy things today--

12:53.814 --> 12:56.984
a dog just barked
my fortune.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.736
Want to know
what it said?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.779
- We found her, sir!
- Never mind.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.657
It's been a pleasure meeting you
both, but if you'll excuse me,

13:03.657 --> 13:06.660
I'm going to go arrest
your heroes.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.166
What?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.792
She was just here,
I swear.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.212
C'mon, we better find her
before the Inspector comes.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.421
Right.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.006
I don't like it much
when he's sore.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.488
Oh.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.115
Your aura is troubled,
my dear.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.201
Perhaps you should
come inside?

13:49.620 --> 13:51.914
I...I think
I'm possessed.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.541
There's something
inside me.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.209
Oh! Double occupancy.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.919
You have an
unwelcome guest.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.088
You have come to
the right place, my dear,

13:59.088 --> 14:01.924
for I am a bridge
to the world of the dead,

14:01.924 --> 14:04.969
gatekeeper to the secrets
of magic and mystery.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.597
Join me, and we will
reach into the beyond.

14:08.597 --> 14:11.225
Please.
I need it out-- now.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.561
You have currency?

14:13.561 --> 14:15.604
No?

14:15.604 --> 14:17.022
Alas, the Beyond
is not free.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.857
Goodnight.
Wait.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.779
Whoa!

14:23.779 --> 14:25.781
Welcome to Darvishes, madam.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.449
Step this way.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.951
Mm-hmm.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.377
Turn right, now!

14:38.377 --> 14:39.920
- What?
- Now!

14:42.756 --> 14:44.258
Turn left!

14:45.384 --> 14:47.261
Up!
- Up?

15:08.699 --> 15:10.159
She's gone.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.869
Stop!

15:14.538 --> 15:16.498
There they are!

15:18.417 --> 15:21.295
Quickly, to the motorized
Ottomatic crime chasers!

15:39.938 --> 15:43.525
Awaken,
spirits from beyond!

15:43.525 --> 15:50.616
Awaken, I say, and leave
this poor girl in peace.

15:55.579 --> 16:00.376
Awaken, I say,
and leave this girl in peace.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.169
Uh, close your eyes, please,

16:02.169 --> 16:04.922
for, when I command you to open,
you will face your possessor.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.925
Yes.

16:07.925 --> 16:10.844
I sense their presence.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.137
Ah, no, no,
no, no!

16:12.137 --> 16:13.514
No peeking!

16:13.514 --> 16:15.516
The spirits inside you
are scared of the light.

16:15.516 --> 16:19.603
Let the darkness
guide their way out.

16:19.603 --> 16:23.357
Now, I, Darvish,
command you, spirits,

16:23.357 --> 16:25.776
to leave
this poor girl.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.032
What?
What's happening?

16:32.032 --> 16:34.243
What's happening?

16:34.243 --> 16:37.162
The spirit is here!
The spirit is here!

16:40.749 --> 16:42.418
It's you.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.362
Pull that
contraption over!

17:10.362 --> 17:11.989
We have you
surrounded!

17:11.989 --> 17:13.991
Not really.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.499
I found her!
Turn right!

17:22.499 --> 17:24.460
Not again!

17:25.586 --> 17:27.963
Oh, what have I done?

17:27.963 --> 17:31.759
I have unleashed
an unspeakable terror.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.761
I am more powerful
than I know.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.262
Oh, God!

17:40.058 --> 17:41.518
How are you doing this?

17:41.518 --> 17:43.145
You shouldn't even
be aware.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.190
I don't know anything.
I just want you out.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.983
That is not
your choice.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.651
It's my body.

17:49.651 --> 17:52.154
For whatever reason,
you were chosen.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.281
This is bigger
than you and me.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.699
I don't want
to be chosen!

17:55.699 --> 17:57.159
You're ruining
my life!

17:57.159 --> 18:01.330
You selfish child.
Everything will be destroyed.

18:01.330 --> 18:05.042
It's my charge to defend life
from the evil we face.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.585
Well, no one's
stopping you.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.129
Maybe you should choose
somebody else's body.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.260
Something's not...

18:15.260 --> 18:16.804
Right!

18:21.767 --> 18:25.479
I have battled this evil
for over 1,000 years,

18:25.479 --> 18:27.606
each time
driving it back.

18:27.606 --> 18:32.027
And now, in this present,
you, a stubborn, petulant child,

18:32.027 --> 18:35.697
will cause it to kill
all of humanity.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.242
I don't even know
what to say to that.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.869
Relinquish yourself
to me!

18:40.869 --> 18:42.788
Or what?

18:49.461 --> 18:51.338
Melinda?
Edred?

18:57.678 --> 18:59.221
Melinda.
Thank goodness.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.639
Are you okay?

19:00.639 --> 19:03.725
I'm fine.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.603
You are very much in trouble,
my friend.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.397
Some of these
that you have destroyed

19:08.397 --> 19:11.900
are priceless antiquities
from the spirit world.

19:17.030 --> 19:19.116
Hey.
There you are.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.201
Wait.
Come back.

19:21.201 --> 19:24.079
I just want to...

19:25.414 --> 19:26.832
What is that?

19:33.338 --> 19:34.756
No one look outside.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.924
What?

19:38.594 --> 19:40.554
That sound,
it's getting closer.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.896
He is
absolutely right.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.607
Melinda,
you stay here.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.484
We will be
right back.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.403
What?

20:00.657 --> 20:02.409
Nothing to see.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.077
Stop that!

20:04.077 --> 20:05.495
What are you doing?

20:05.495 --> 20:06.914
Why are you acting
so weird?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.624
Enough!

20:23.138 --> 20:24.723
Uh...

20:24.723 --> 20:26.642
who... are they?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.769
Strike deep,
strike true.

20:28.769 --> 20:32.356
Strike until you cut
right through.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.774
So strange!

20:33.774 --> 20:36.944
It-- It appears that the glow
that breathes life

20:36.944 --> 20:39.738
into the statues is the same
as the pachyderm

20:39.738 --> 20:41.823
from the previous day.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.291
We fight.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.212
No. I won't do it.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.713
This is not
my fight.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.256
Ow!

20:58.256 --> 21:02.636
No! You can't make me!

21:21.488 --> 21:22.906
There you are.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.997
Nice puppy.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.462
Something's not right.

21:37.462 --> 21:39.381
Melinda, we need you!

21:39.381 --> 21:41.925
No!
I won't do it!

21:41.925 --> 21:44.553
Find....someone....else.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.025
I hate you.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.449
She's returned.

22:18.336 --> 22:21.381
There's something else here.
