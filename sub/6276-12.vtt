00:12.291 --> 00:13.667
Previously on Ray Donovan...

00:13.750 --> 00:15.250
Ray? I need to see you.

00:15.333 --> 00:16.375
She's a reporter.

00:16.458 --> 00:17.166
She's gonna publish
an article that says

00:17.250 --> 00:19.333
I brought Sully Sullivan
out here.

00:19.417 --> 00:20.917
And I paid him to kill Mickey.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.041
Can't you stop her?

00:22.125 --> 00:23.917
RAY:
I could, but I won't.

00:24.000 --> 00:24.750
You're hiding something from me.

00:24.834 --> 00:27.667
Kate McPherson,

00:27.750 --> 00:30.500
you're a real pisser,
you know that?

00:30.583 --> 00:31.875
Ray Donovan,

00:31.959 --> 00:35.875
you're a real pisser, too.

00:35.959 --> 00:38.458
This woman is gonna
fuck everything up, Ray.

00:38.542 --> 00:40.458
You come after
her or me,

00:40.542 --> 00:42.417
this goes viral.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.625
AVI: You are letting
everything fall apart.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.542
You let another man
fuck your wife.

00:45.625 --> 00:46.709
And you do nothing abou...

00:46.792 --> 00:48.667
Ooh!
Shit.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.083
RAY:
There's a body buried there.

00:50.166 --> 00:52.125
Anything happens
to Kate McPherson,

00:52.208 --> 00:53.375
that body comes up.

00:53.458 --> 00:54.959
EZRA: She's been warned.

00:55.041 --> 00:56.625
She has to be stopped.

00:56.709 --> 00:58.542
I've always needed you,
I love you.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.250
I love you, too.

01:00.333 --> 01:00.917
MICKEY:
He's fucking around on you.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.959
He was with another woman.

01:04.041 --> 01:04.750
Allan and I,
we have our ups and downs.

01:04.834 --> 01:07.583
But we have
a good life.

01:07.667 --> 01:08.875
You got to lift me.

01:10.291 --> 01:12.625
Were you ever afraid that
you were gonna do something?

01:12.709 --> 01:14.917
Please go.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.083
How much would it
be worth to you

01:16.166 --> 01:17.333
if I could put
your father away tonight?

01:17.417 --> 01:17.834
You tell me.

01:17.917 --> 01:19.959
A hundred grand.

01:20.375 --> 01:21.125
I'm locked in!

01:21.208 --> 01:24.250
Get the fuck
out of here, Mick!

01:24.333 --> 01:25.583
(sirens approaching)
Where's Terry?

01:25.667 --> 01:26.333
Just drive, son.

01:26.417 --> 01:28.000
ASHLEY:
He's here again, Ray.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.709
That creep who was stalking me.

01:29.792 --> 01:31.333
BOB:
He's the bad guy, Ray. Not me.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.166
He hits her!

01:34.250 --> 01:35.333
I've seen it!

01:35.417 --> 01:36.542
BRIDGET:
I was in the car.

01:36.625 --> 01:38.458
And Daddy made me lie
to the police.

01:38.542 --> 01:39.500
I just got a call from my plant
at Stalkerazzi.

01:39.583 --> 01:42.333
Somebody's got a video
of the Re-Kon shooting.

01:42.417 --> 01:42.667
COOKIE:
Did you get it?

01:42.750 --> 01:44.625
Yeah.

01:44.709 --> 01:45.834
Well, when am I gonna see it?

01:45.917 --> 01:46.792
Right now.

01:46.875 --> 01:47.834
Where can I meet you?

01:47.917 --> 01:48.542
My house.

01:48.625 --> 01:50.834
Half an hour.

01:50.917 --> 01:52.000
(explosion)

01:52.083 --> 01:54.667
There was an explosion,
and I think I broke my arm.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.166
You almost killed your grandson.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.792
(officers shouting)

01:57.875 --> 01:58.458
I'll fucking kill you.

01:58.542 --> 01:59.792
Get the fuck away from me.

01:59.875 --> 02:01.583
RAY:
It's alright, Con.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.000
It's all right.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.291
Fuck.

02:39.542 --> 02:41.333
Hey.

02:41.417 --> 02:42.041
What about Terry?
Did you get him out?

02:42.125 --> 02:44.250
He was arraigned
this morning.

02:44.333 --> 02:45.250
Bail's
at 50 grand.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.333
You pay it?

02:46.417 --> 02:47.375
He refused it.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.417
He what?

02:48.500 --> 02:49.917
Yeah, he's
still there.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.083
Why?

02:51.166 --> 02:54.125
I don't know.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.291
Money still there?

02:55.375 --> 02:56.417
Yeah, it's
in the trunk.

03:02.875 --> 03:05.208
(recording):
This is Cookie Brown.
You know what to do.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.250
Find Cookie Brown.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.208
Tell him I need to
meet with him today.

03:09.291 --> 03:10.375
All right.

03:24.542 --> 03:26.667
(grunts loudly)

03:30.834 --> 03:31.542
What the...?

03:37.542 --> 03:38.917
Jesus.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.667
There's barely 20 grand here.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.291
Fuck.

03:46.375 --> 03:48.583
You mean to tell me Terry
got locked up for that?

03:48.667 --> 03:49.583
You really fucked up
this time, Mick.

03:49.667 --> 03:52.041
That's not even enough
to bail him out with.

03:52.125 --> 03:54.959
Ray'll bail him out,
don't worry about that.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.792
They must have switched
the dates for the pickup

03:56.875 --> 03:57.667
or some shit.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.709
Something I couldn't have
known about.

03:59.792 --> 04:02.250
Come on, let's go.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.792
How far is it to Palm Springs?

04:09.875 --> 04:11.834
I don't know,
about an hour?

04:14.333 --> 04:17.333
You want to go see my mom?
What, now?

04:17.417 --> 04:19.083
No, Allan.

04:19.166 --> 04:21.625
I said some things
I shouldn't have.

04:21.709 --> 04:23.709
I was out of line.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.000
We're right here.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.625
I want to apologize.

04:26.709 --> 04:28.125
Mickey, are you crazy?

04:28.208 --> 04:29.333
That man don't want to see you.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.291
Well, you never know.

04:31.375 --> 04:33.542
Come on. I'll feel better.

04:34.709 --> 04:37.166
A bail is a promise,

04:37.250 --> 04:39.875
and I don't promise.

04:39.959 --> 04:41.667
I'm a flight risk.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.875
You don't want
to be here, Terry.

04:43.959 --> 04:45.875
You're sick.
You need medicine.

04:45.959 --> 04:46.959
I won't leave.
You're being
ridiculous.

04:47.041 --> 04:49.291
No one even got hurt.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.083
I hit a man
who didn't deserve it

04:51.166 --> 04:53.208
to get money.

04:53.291 --> 04:55.667
(scoffs)
Jesus Christ.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.458
Story of my life, Terry.

04:59.417 --> 05:01.417
Doesn't matter anyway, I'm...

05:01.500 --> 05:02.709
I'm going to prison.

05:02.792 --> 05:03.834
Armed robbery.

05:03.917 --> 05:06.291
Maybe not.

05:06.375 --> 05:08.041
There's things I can do.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.375
Yeah, what, more
of your dirty business?

05:09.458 --> 05:10.667
You just sign the
fucking papers

05:10.750 --> 05:11.959
so we can get
out of here.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.709
I told you,
I'm staying.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.875
I deserve to be punished.

05:17.959 --> 05:19.250
What are you fucking
talking about?

05:19.333 --> 05:20.083
All of a sudden you're
some God-fearing Catholic?

05:20.166 --> 05:23.333
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I am.

05:23.417 --> 05:25.083
What'd the fucking
Catholic Church ever do for you?

05:25.166 --> 05:27.166
I'm sorry, Raymond. I believe.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.583
And maybe you should, too.

05:29.667 --> 05:30.709
Listen to me.

05:30.792 --> 05:33.333
Mickey got you
into this, all right?

05:33.417 --> 05:36.417
You'd have never done this
on your own.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.417
You're a good man, Terry.

05:49.458 --> 05:51.625
What the fuck do you know
about being a good man, Raymond?

06:02.208 --> 06:03.542
I'm in trouble.

06:06.125 --> 06:09.750
I might be going away.

06:09.834 --> 06:12.250
I need you out of here
to take care of the family.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.333
No. I can't, Ray.

06:14.417 --> 06:17.000
If you don't do it, Mickey will.

06:27.375 --> 06:29.458
If you change your mind,
call the fucking bondsman.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.542
Guard!

06:42.709 --> 06:44.709
(phone line ringing)

06:44.792 --> 06:46.125
COOKIE:
What you want, Ray?

06:46.208 --> 06:47.458
You called me ten
times last night.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.041
You want to see
the tape or not?

06:49.125 --> 06:51.458
Oh, I already saw it, Ray.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.417
Are you surprised?

06:54.500 --> 06:57.333
Think you're the only guy
out there working for me?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.000
We need to talk.

06:59.083 --> 07:02.542
Yeah, we need to talk.

07:02.625 --> 07:05.709
But right now I'm setting up
my son's birthday party.

07:05.792 --> 07:06.750
But I'll see you later.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.917
Where the fuck's Avi?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I don't know, boss.

07:13.083 --> 07:14.667
I haven't heard from him
since 8:00 last night.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.333
I want you to go to my house,
stay with my family.

07:17.417 --> 07:18.709
Okay.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.083
You got a gun?

07:32.083 --> 07:33.000
Are we going to Boston?

07:33.083 --> 07:36.375
I don't know, Bridg,
I'm thinking about it.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.250
Why?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.709
I thought maybe a change
would do us good.

07:39.792 --> 07:43.166
You mean you're afraid
that Cookie's gonna kill me.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.625
Bridg, stop it.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.291
I'm not afraid of him.

07:46.375 --> 07:49.041
He should be in jail.
And I'm not going to Boston.

07:52.375 --> 07:54.125
I want another pill.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.291
Conor, you get one
every four hours.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.208
But it hurts.

07:58.291 --> 07:58.667
Stop being a baby.
(knocking)

08:01.208 --> 08:02.542
Hey.

08:03.542 --> 08:06.458
Mom, your boyfriend's here.

08:07.208 --> 08:08.709
CONOR:
I want to meet him.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.959
Is this the guy Dad said
you could fuck in your bed?

08:13.041 --> 08:15.125
Wait here.

08:16.625 --> 08:17.959
Stay there.
I'm serious,

08:18.041 --> 08:18.709
Conor.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.792
Look, I really need
to talk to you.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.917
Don't just show up here.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.417
Your husband just got out
of jail. We have time.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.583
I don't care.
That's not what it's about.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.208
You don't come here.

08:42.291 --> 08:45.333
I put my life on the line
for you, Abby. My career.

08:45.417 --> 08:48.500
And it didn't
do a thing, did it?

08:48.583 --> 08:50.834
It doesn't work that way.
You don't snap your fingers

08:50.917 --> 08:52.458
and someone gets put away.

08:54.417 --> 08:57.417
I can still protect you.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.208
How?

08:59.291 --> 09:00.834
We'll figure it out.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.834
That's not good enough.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.208
I was in L.A.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.834
And I found out what happened
to your daughter.

09:15.458 --> 09:18.250
I wanted to tell you
before you read about it.

09:18.333 --> 09:21.917
She's dead, right?

09:24.709 --> 09:25.875
Is that what you're
trying to telling me?

09:25.959 --> 09:29.792
Yes.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.125
I'm so sorry.

09:32.208 --> 09:34.750
Did that fucking prick
Sully do it?

09:35.917 --> 09:37.125
Yes.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.208
How?

09:38.291 --> 09:40.458
Mrs. Shaughnessy, I...

09:40.542 --> 09:42.625
I don't know.

09:42.709 --> 09:45.792
Bet you he strangled her,
just like the other two.

09:58.125 --> 10:00.083
Can you go? Now?

10:00.166 --> 10:03.000
Please?

10:22.667 --> 10:23.792
(keys jangle)

10:39.667 --> 10:39.834
(muffled gunshot)

11:11.083 --> 11:13.083
(distant music playing,
indistinct chatter)

11:27.375 --> 11:29.500
Hold up, Ray.

11:33.792 --> 11:36.834
(scoffs)
It's a birthday party, Ray.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.125
Baby, wave to Mommy and Daddy.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.333
You better smile, boy.
(giggles)

11:46.417 --> 11:48.542
I'll be right back.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.709
Where my money?

11:56.792 --> 11:58.500
I'll bring it later.

11:58.583 --> 11:59.959
Why you ain't bring it now?

12:00.041 --> 12:01.291
We got some things
to sort out, first.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.917
Let's go inside.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.083
Smile, baby.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.041
Sit down, Ray.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.125
Where'd you get the tape?

12:20.208 --> 12:22.834
Fuck does it matter
where I got the tape?

12:22.917 --> 12:24.917
We got a problem.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.917
Snowflake is on that tape.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.041
You want to kill me now, right?

12:33.125 --> 12:36.291
No, I don't want
to kill you, Cookie.

12:36.375 --> 12:39.667
I just want to make sure
you don't hurt my kid.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.834
BOY:
Daddy! Daddy!

12:41.917 --> 12:43.041
Hey-hey!

12:43.125 --> 12:45.500
Alfonse! This is
the birthday boy.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.333
Say hello to
Mr. Ray Donovan.

12:47.417 --> 12:48.583
Hi.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.542
Hey.

12:51.917 --> 12:55.750
So what did baby girl
say to the cops?

12:55.834 --> 12:58.250
She told them the truth.

12:58.333 --> 13:00.125
Marvin and Re-Kon
were getting high,

13:00.208 --> 13:04.917
she got upset, they let her out
at Sunset and La Brea.

14:12.208 --> 14:15.291

16:40.625 --> 16:42.458
Okay.

16:42.542 --> 16:46.375

really fucked up.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.417
That girl I liked...

16:48.500 --> 16:50.583
Patty...

16:52.166 --> 16:54.667
...she has this kid, Clifford.

16:58.166 --> 17:00.083
I hurt him.

17:00.166 --> 17:03.667
She wanted me to take him
out of the bath.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.625
I went in there.

17:05.709 --> 17:09.083
He was naked.

17:09.166 --> 17:10.750
I didn't want to pick him up.

17:10.834 --> 17:15.458
But he kept
asking me to.

17:16.625 --> 17:17.917
So I went to do it...

17:18.000 --> 17:20.166
and he wrapped his legs
around me.

17:20.250 --> 17:23.250
Fuckin' freaked me out.
And I threw him down.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.333
I shouldn't be around kids.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.583
Right?

17:33.667 --> 17:35.333
I shouldn't be around
naked kids.

17:39.458 --> 17:40.959
What if...

17:41.041 --> 17:44.250
what if I hurt him
the way I got hurt?

17:44.333 --> 17:47.500
ROBERT:
A lot of us feel this way.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.792

18:01.625 --> 18:05.166
You ever think about
being sexual with a kid?

18:05.250 --> 18:06.959
No.

Bunchy...
you're okay.

18:16.583 --> 18:21.000

doesn't mean you're gonna abuse.

Sit down, Raymond.

27:58.667 --> 28:00.250
I'm not fucking
sitting down, Ezra.

28:00.333 --> 28:02.083
She was the rodef.

28:02.166 --> 28:05.834
We warned her.

28:05.917 --> 28:08.417
You did as much as you
could to protect her,

28:08.500 --> 28:09.834
but I had to step in.

28:09.917 --> 28:11.750
I couldn't let her destroy us.

28:11.834 --> 28:13.917
You sent Avi.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.083
Of course I did.

28:16.166 --> 28:18.959
You don't know
who you are anymore, Ray.

28:19.041 --> 28:20.917
I'm sure you
convinced yourself

28:21.000 --> 28:22.959
you were in love
with this woman.
Shut up.

28:23.041 --> 28:24.583
It's all gotten
away from you,

28:24.667 --> 28:27.875
and I needed to make it right.

28:27.959 --> 28:29.250
I love you.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.834
Avi loves you.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.083
It's over, Ezra.

28:40.542 --> 28:42.625
What are you
doing, Raymond?

28:42.709 --> 28:43.834
I warned you.

28:50.375 --> 28:52.709
Yeah, I'd like
to report a body.

28:52.792 --> 28:55.792
It's buried at the Ruth Goldman
Ovarian Cancer Center.

28:55.875 --> 28:56.792
(quietly):
Raymond!

28:56.875 --> 28:58.125
Third and La Cienega.

28:58.208 --> 29:01.041
Thank you.

29:13.375 --> 29:15.250
(indistinct chatter)

29:25.583 --> 29:27.834
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen, please

29:27.917 --> 29:29.500
eighth race is now being
taken off the turf

29:29.583 --> 29:31.500
and will be run...

29:31.583 --> 29:33.166
MICKEY:
Ronald.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.208
Yeah, that's him,
that's him.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.000
(grunts)

29:45.166 --> 29:47.000
(panting)

29:58.291 --> 30:00.208
Oh, yeah.

30:00.291 --> 30:03.208
There he is.

30:03.291 --> 30:04.750
Get out of there,
motherfucker.

30:04.834 --> 30:05.709
Leave me alone.

30:05.792 --> 30:07.750
I'm gonna count to five.

30:07.834 --> 30:10.917
One, two, three...

30:11.000 --> 30:12.208
(growls)

30:12.291 --> 30:15.792
I trusted you
with my family, you fuck.
(grunting)

30:15.875 --> 30:17.709
Oh!

30:17.792 --> 30:18.542
Ooh! (grunts)

30:18.625 --> 30:21.375
(panting):
Wait... wait...

30:21.458 --> 30:23.542
(coughs)

30:25.458 --> 30:26.875
The fuck is you doing?
Timing this beating?

30:26.959 --> 30:28.792
How much fucking money

30:28.875 --> 30:30.917
did you get out of that safe?
Anything?

30:31.000 --> 30:31.875
None of your fucking business.

30:31.959 --> 30:35.750
There's a horse in the seventh.
(grunts)

30:35.834 --> 30:37.333
Papa's Mustache.

30:37.417 --> 30:39.834
Papa's fuckin' Mustache--
are you sick?

30:39.917 --> 30:41.542
If you got anything
out of that fucking safe,

30:41.625 --> 30:43.083
we've got ten minutes.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.333
Pop, you're not
buying this, are you?

30:47.417 --> 30:48.291
This guy's a fucking degenerate.

30:48.375 --> 30:50.834
He's lost the last
three races on grass,

30:50.917 --> 30:52.083
but he's never lost on dirt.

30:54.834 --> 30:56.291
He's a lock.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.083
Mick.

31:01.750 --> 31:03.750
He's beat up enough, for now.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.083
Let's go see that horse.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.625
I wanted to tell you

31:17.709 --> 31:19.917
when we first
started to go out.

31:22.083 --> 31:24.709
But I was afraid.

31:24.792 --> 31:27.583
I'm really sorry that
happened to you, Bunchy.

31:27.667 --> 31:30.625
It's... It's awful.

31:30.709 --> 31:32.375
No.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.792
I'm okay.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.959
Really, I am.

31:38.792 --> 31:41.875
I-I go to this group--

31:41.959 --> 31:45.750
Survivors Network
of those Abused by Priests.

31:49.333 --> 31:50.750
They say it's a common thing.

31:50.834 --> 31:55.125
You know that you won't do it...

31:57.041 --> 31:59.041
...but you're afraid
that you will.

32:00.750 --> 32:03.125
But you know that you won't.

32:04.583 --> 32:08.500
So, that's it.

32:08.583 --> 32:10.291
Pretty much.

32:12.083 --> 32:14.709
Thank you for your
honesty, Bunchy.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.166
Wait, can't we just...

32:19.250 --> 32:20.458
go back to the way it was?

32:20.542 --> 32:22.000
(sighs)

32:22.083 --> 32:24.166
I really want to keep
seeing you and Clifford.

32:24.250 --> 32:25.625
No.

32:25.709 --> 32:27.875
Bunchy.

32:27.959 --> 32:28.875
I...

32:28.959 --> 32:31.834
I can't put my
son's well-being

32:31.917 --> 32:34.166
at risk for something
that you're unsure of.

32:34.250 --> 32:35.458
But I'm not unsure.

32:35.542 --> 32:37.834
How can you know

32:37.917 --> 32:39.500
for a fact

32:39.583 --> 32:41.250
that you would
never do anything?

32:45.250 --> 32:47.166
If you were that worried...

32:50.000 --> 32:51.834
...there must be a reason.

33:06.625 --> 33:08.709
Come on, Mick, this is all
the money we got.

33:08.792 --> 33:09.625
Let's just get out
of here, already.

33:09.709 --> 33:11.709
There he is.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.875
Looks good.

33:14.917 --> 33:17.875
He's gone up to eight-to-one.

33:17.959 --> 33:19.875
Come on, you promised we could
do something with that money.

33:19.959 --> 33:21.083
Start my own business.

33:23.125 --> 33:25.500
LINDA:
Mickey.

33:25.583 --> 33:26.792
What?

33:26.875 --> 33:27.750
LINDA:
Mickey?

33:27.834 --> 33:31.917
I forgive you, Mickey.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.834
I'm in a better place now.

33:35.667 --> 33:37.834
What'd you say?

33:37.917 --> 33:40.959
LINDA:
You are the captain.

33:41.041 --> 33:42.166
(whinnies softly)

33:45.291 --> 33:45.625
Number seven.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.542
What about it?

33:47.625 --> 33:50.500
What's his name?

33:51.834 --> 33:53.917
Uh, The Captain.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.667
Holy shit.

34:00.750 --> 34:02.250
What's up?

34:02.333 --> 34:04.917
Holy shit.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.083
Let's go.

34:20.542 --> 34:22.125
Come on, Pop,
let's just get out of here.

34:22.208 --> 34:24.959
Give me the money.

34:27.709 --> 34:29.125
All of it.

34:35.709 --> 34:37.291
$20,000.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.417
Put it all on The Captain.
To win.

34:39.500 --> 34:43.291
Shit.

34:43.375 --> 34:44.417
Captain.

34:44.500 --> 34:45.667
Jesus, Mick.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.542
Son, trust me.

34:48.625 --> 34:50.542
I know this is right.

34:57.709 --> 34:59.834
(phone ringing)

35:03.125 --> 35:03.667
AVI:
Boss,

35:03.750 --> 35:05.750
we need to talk.

35:05.834 --> 35:08.959
How much did he pay you?

35:09.041 --> 35:12.041
No, boss. No money.

35:12.125 --> 35:13.250
Believe me.

35:21.375 --> 35:22.875
Some good cake, dawg.

35:39.166 --> 35:40.250
(knocks)

35:53.458 --> 35:55.417
You gonna shoot me, Cookie?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.166
I don't know, Ray.

35:57.250 --> 35:59.542
I don't always want to be
looking over my shoulder.

35:59.625 --> 36:02.959
Yeah.

36:03.041 --> 36:05.166
I know the feeling.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.959
I trust you, Ray.
Ain't no need to do that.

36:13.041 --> 36:15.041
I got people to handle
that shit, you know?

36:17.667 --> 36:18.875
How's this gonna work?

36:18.959 --> 36:21.000
What you mean, Ray?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.917
How do I know for sure...

36:24.000 --> 36:26.166
you're not gonna hurt my kid?

36:29.083 --> 36:30.417
You don't.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.750
(gunshot)

36:33.834 --> 36:35.291
I didn't think so.

36:43.917 --> 36:45.875
Drop it.

36:45.959 --> 36:48.375
Drop the fucking gun.

36:58.625 --> 37:01.208
There's a million
dollars on that table.

37:02.709 --> 37:03.959
$500,000, if
you split it.

37:04.041 --> 37:06.959
A million if you don't.

37:10.583 --> 37:12.542
I'll let you two
sort that out.

37:14.166 --> 37:16.500
(door closes)

37:25.792 --> 37:27.875
(gunshot)

37:31.000 --> 37:33.208

It's a 6-furlong race...

37:49.500 --> 37:50.750
I don't know, Pop.

37:50.834 --> 37:53.625
Hey.
All right.

37:55.333 --> 37:56.583
There it is.

37:56.667 --> 37:57.917
There's the starting gate.

37:58.000 --> 37:58.959
DARYLL:
You sure about this?

37:59.041 --> 38:01.083
You'll see.

38:25.959 --> 38:28.458
He's in the pack.
He's doing all right,
he's doing all right.

38:28.542 --> 38:29.208
Come on, m

Shorty, did you see it?

39:31.208 --> 39:34.166
Did you see it?! Huh?!
I told you!

Ray,

39:40.875 --> 39:43.542
I need you to come over
right now.

39:43.625 --> 39:44.458
What happened?

39:44.542 --> 39:46.125
Please, I'm begging you.

39:46.208 --> 39:48.834
You'll come, won't you?

39:48.917 --> 39:51.417
I'm on my way.

39:56.834 --> 39:58.000
(groans softly)

39:58.083 --> 39:59.000
MICKEY:
What are you complaining about?

39:59.083 --> 40:01.542
You'd train anyone
who comes in that door.

40:01.625 --> 40:04.083
(chuckles)
That's me, bum magnet.

40:04.166 --> 40:06.875
MICKEY:
That's who you are.

40:07.792 --> 40:10.041
Terry.

40:13.834 --> 40:14.959
Ray bail you out?

40:15.041 --> 40:15.959
Yeah.

40:16.041 --> 40:18.208
Good. I knew he would.

40:21.083 --> 40:22.875
Where the fuck were you?

40:22.959 --> 40:24.000
I had shit to take care of.

40:24.083 --> 40:24.959
For all of us.

40:25.041 --> 40:27.750
(pills rattling)

40:27.834 --> 40:30.083
We won...

40:30.166 --> 40:32.583
a million fucking dollars.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.583
Look.

40:38.583 --> 40:39.959
Here's your cut.

40:40.041 --> 40:42.083
Ter.

40:47.583 --> 40:49.166
There you go.

40:49.250 --> 40:52.250
Keep countin', Mick.

40:54.208 --> 40:55.500
All right.

40:55.583 --> 40:58.000
Since you weren't there
to make the bet,

40:58.083 --> 41:02.333
I thought, uh, you'd take less.

41:02.417 --> 41:04.959
But, uh, you're
right, you're right.

41:05.041 --> 41:07.667
I'm the one going to jail.

41:14.542 --> 41:16.458
Now get the fuck out of here.

41:16.542 --> 41:17.959
What are you mad about?

41:18.041 --> 41:21.250
You told me to make a run
for it, didn't you?

41:22.125 --> 41:24.291
Get out of here, Mick.

41:24.375 --> 41:28.291
I don't want you here no more.

41:36.375 --> 41:39.333
Buy some new equipment

41:39.417 --> 41:42.083
and get the floors fixed.

41:43.250 --> 41:44.917
This place looks like shit.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.125
(chuckles)

42:16.083 --> 42:18.959
Where is she?

42:42.166 --> 42:45.166
STEVE:
He was really gonna
hurt her this time.

42:48.208 --> 42:51.291
I need you to get rid
of the body, Ray.

42:51.375 --> 42:53.500
What happened?

42:56.417 --> 42:58.458
No fucking lying
this time, all right?

42:58.542 --> 43:00.250
I... He...
(sighs)

43:00.333 --> 43:03.834
Was he hitting
you again?

43:06.417 --> 43:08.500
Yes.

43:08.583 --> 43:11.500
And... Bob tried to stop him.

43:11.583 --> 43:14.959
It was self-defense.
(chuckles)

43:15.041 --> 43:17.166
He-he fell.

43:17.250 --> 43:19.792
He didn't fall!
You pushed him!

43:20.875 --> 43:23.834
What the fuck
does it really matter?

43:25.458 --> 43:28.291
I mean, what are
you gonna do, Ray?

43:28.375 --> 43:31.417
Are you gonna kill me?

43:31.500 --> 43:33.625
Give me your keys.

43:41.041 --> 43:43.834
Let's go.

43:43.917 --> 43:45.792
I don't really care.

43:45.875 --> 43:47.750
It felt good.

43:47.834 --> 43:49.917
It was liberating!

43:50.000 --> 43:53.125
I mean, didn't you
ever kill anybody, Ray?

43:53.208 --> 43:55.542
See? I can tell.

43:55.625 --> 43:57.500
I can tell. You saw that. You...

43:57.583 --> 43:59.834
He... You definitely have.

44:05.834 --> 44:06.917
Get in.

44:15.959 --> 44:17.583
Eros.

44:17.667 --> 44:19.333
Thanatos.

44:19.417 --> 44:22.083
It's all the same.

44:22.166 --> 44:24.542
Death, love,

44:24.625 --> 44:26.709
sex.

44:26.792 --> 44:28.375
We're all just in it, Ray.

44:28.458 --> 44:32.166
This wonderful stew.

44:32.250 --> 44:34.417
Get in the fucking
trunk, Steve.

44:34.500 --> 44:37.291
I trust you.
Yeah.

44:49.125 --> 44:51.041
We're the same, aren't we?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.375
I knew it the minute I met you.

44:57.458 --> 44:59.542
(chuckles)

45:03.667 --> 45:04.917
(chuckles)

45:07.125 --> 45:09.000
Give me your phone.

45:19.041 --> 45:21.959
Tell the truth
this time.

45:26.667 --> 45:29.333
STEVE:
Back in the womb!

45:29.417 --> 45:32.625
(laughs)
I love it.

45:32.709 --> 45:34.542
(laughs)

45:43.542 --> 45:45.625
(sighs)

45:51.542 --> 45:53.125
CONOR:
Hey, Mom.

45:53.208 --> 45:55.041
Did you see?

45:56.083 --> 45:57.875
REPORTER: Breaking news,
we have just learned

45:57.959 --> 45:59.000
that rap star, record producer

45:59.083 --> 46:02.250
and music mogul, Cookie Brown,
has been found dead

46:02.333 --> 46:04.333
in his home in Los Angeles.

46:04.417 --> 46:08.000
Police had been alerted by
a 911 call made from his address

46:08.083 --> 46:10.750
by someone who was thought
to be his housekeeper.

46:10.834 --> 46:13.000
At this time, local police
have arrived at the scene,

46:13.083 --> 46:17.208
and already the media
is converging at the location.

46:17.291 --> 46:20.208
No further information has been
given to us at this time...
