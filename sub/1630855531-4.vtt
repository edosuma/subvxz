WEBVTT

00:16.880 --> 00:19.800
Lesi, could you play something
that's got a bit of swing?

00:20.800 --> 00:24.400
I'm in the mood for something modern,
but not Bebop.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.200
Ah.

00:27.600 --> 00:28.600
Perfect.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.720
Oh, I wish I could stop
and give you a lift, but I'm so late.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.480
I'm sure someone will stop for you.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.560
How odd.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.360
I'm so, so sorry.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.440
I really do have to get to-- Oh!

00:52.360 --> 00:55.120
I'm so sorry, can you be an angel
and give me a lift?

00:55.120 --> 00:58.320
My car's broken down and my phone's dead.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.880
Just to the next town,
there's a garage there.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.440
Oh... yes, well...

01:03.760 --> 01:05.560
I suppose you better climb in, then.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.760
You are the nicest person.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.640
- I'd given up, thank you.
- Yeah.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.960
I knew you couldn't resist
somebody under stress.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.000
What a heap of junk this car is.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.440
You'd think you would've upgraded
sometime in the last 90 years, but no.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.320
Who are you?

01:32.880 --> 01:34.160
It's Aziraphale, isn't it?

01:35.400 --> 01:37.280
Former Angel of the Eastern Gate.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.840
You have the advantage on me.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.800
I do, yes.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.200
Shax.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.200
Former Admissions demon, senior grade.

01:51.640 --> 01:55.800
Now a Hell's ambassador planner,
potentially to this corner of the planet.

01:56.760 --> 01:59.280
Replacing the demon Crowley.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.880
Oh.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.720
Crowley's got Gabriel, hasn't he?

02:08.600 --> 02:10.480
I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.000
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.960
Crowley is hiding the Angel Gabriel.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.120
I think you must have me
confused for someone else.

02:17.600 --> 02:22.440
I'm a little bemused as to why
Crowley should risk destruction for you.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.760
You don't seem his type at all.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.360
I can tell how Crowley's got him.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.280
Crowley doesn't have Gabriel.
Where would he put him?

02:32.680 --> 02:35.160
Gabriel would never go to Crowley,
he hates Crowley.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.280
He hates you.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.880
I don't know where he is,
but he isn't with Crowley.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.800
- No?
- No.

02:45.320 --> 02:47.200
You know what?

02:48.440 --> 02:50.240
Sometime in the last 18, 19 years,

02:50.240 --> 02:52.480
I remember hearing
that you and Crowley were an item.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.680
I didn't believe it then.

02:55.560 --> 02:56.640
Not really.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.680
Poor old Furfur.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.880
He thought you were
his ticket to the big time.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.840
Now he's on requisitions.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.520
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you are talking about.

03:10.080 --> 03:15.120
Nor where this Angel Gabriel,
who I've never heard of, might be.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.720
You can let me out here.

03:18.840 --> 03:21.280
- This is in the middle of nowhere.
- Sounds about right.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.560
It's okay.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.120
You've already told me where he is.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.040
No! How, how did I tell you
where Gabriel is?

03:31.360 --> 03:32.400
You didn't.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.240
You have now.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.520
If the bomb does land here,

05:22.520 --> 05:24.200
it would take a real miracle

05:24.440 --> 05:27.000
for my friend and I to survive it.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.400
That was very kind of you.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.240
- Shut up.
- Well...

05:51.080 --> 05:53.360
It was. No paperwork for us to have.

05:54.880 --> 05:55.880
Oh, the books.

05:56.280 --> 05:57.280
Oh.

05:57.960 --> 06:00.200
I forgot all the books.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.760
Oh, they'll all be blown to--

06:05.720 --> 06:09.520
Little demonic miracle of man. Lift home?

06:19.640 --> 06:20.720
<i>Hello.</i>

06:21.040 --> 06:23.320
<i>Have a miserable eternity.</i>

06:23.760 --> 06:27.880
<i>We'd like to apologize for the wait
and the conditions, but we won't.</i>

06:28.880 --> 06:33.080
<i>Cheer up.
Things could be worse, and they will be.</i>

06:34.840 --> 06:36.600
Shoot number four, all the way down.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.280
Have a miserable eternity.

06:38.520 --> 06:39.640
Next.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.360
<i>...for the rest of eternity,</i>

06:41.360 --> 06:44.400
<i>worse and worse and worse.</i>

06:44.680 --> 06:45.680
Next.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.720
I've had enough of this, I need a cuppa.
You'll have to wait.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.600
Excuse me. Excuse me!

06:54.280 --> 06:57.880
<i>Hello.
Have a miserable eternity.</i>

06:58.400 --> 07:02.360
<i>We'd like to apologize for the wait
and the conditions, but we won't.</i>

07:04.520 --> 07:07.640
<i>Cheer up.
Things could be worse and they will be.</i>

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
Aargh.

07:13.920 --> 07:14.920
Ouch.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.680
Unbelievable.

07:22.920 --> 07:23.920
Having a rough one?

07:24.600 --> 07:26.120
No, no, it's perfect.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.360
I've spent all morning
processing 52 men called Otto.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.120
You know,

07:31.720 --> 07:33.240
if you really want to get out of here,

07:34.280 --> 07:37.760
I believe they are looking to move some
people from Admissions to Temptations.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.760
Well, it's never come easy to me.
Climbing the greasy pole.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.080
I get all double tongue tied.

07:43.920 --> 07:44.920
The thing is...

07:45.480 --> 07:47.640
I do have the ear of the higher demons.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.680
I could always put in a word for you.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.840
Really?

07:54.280 --> 07:56.720
If you were to hear something
on the Hell burn,

07:57.440 --> 08:00.000
some demon somewhere up to some good,

08:00.800 --> 08:01.920
just let me know.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.800
I could get you
in front of the Dark Council.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.280
You'd do that for me?

08:08.400 --> 08:09.440
Then some day,

08:10.400 --> 08:11.880
and that day may never come,

08:12.720 --> 08:13.800
I could call on you

08:14.800 --> 08:16.000
to do a service for me.

08:17.520 --> 08:18.920
Yeah, yeah I will.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.000
You know...

08:31.640 --> 08:32.920
that was a very nice thing

08:33.640 --> 08:35.480
- you did for me.
- Shut up.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.920
There must be something I can do for you

08:38.880 --> 08:40.760
- in return.
- Forget it, will you?

08:41.600 --> 08:42.600
Right.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.120
Spot of business to do.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.840
Spreading the old demon drink.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.400
Ah.

08:57.760 --> 08:58.960
The theater.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.240
Bravo! Sophocles, Shakespeare.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.480
- Something like that.
- So improving.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.760
Talking of improving.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.720
Time for delivery
of some black market joy.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.640
Lovely bottles of joy.
Thank you for sending proof.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.840
We should not be here.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.160
I'm telling you now,
my planning is always exemplary.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.440
I had the Luftwaffe bombing plans

09:23.440 --> 09:26.120
and everything was going
to the East end of London.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.400
Absolutely.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.520
It has something to do
with that swine Crowley.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
What did you just say?

09:34.200 --> 09:38.320
It was Mr. Crowley's meddling
that caused this.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.520
Crowley?

09:40.240 --> 09:42.000
Yes, they did say something about...

09:42.280 --> 09:45.480
demonic interventions
just before the bomb hit the church.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.640
They? Who is they?

09:46.760 --> 09:49.400
Crowley and his bookseller friend,
Mr. Fell.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.600
Real sissy type, a proper fear girl.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.520
Schtum for a minute.
So this all happened in a church?

09:56.400 --> 09:57.640
And this Crowley was there?

09:57.960 --> 10:00.160
In a church, on hallowed ground?

10:04.080 --> 10:05.080
Tell me...

10:08.440 --> 10:09.440
everything.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.880
Broken? All of them?

10:15.640 --> 10:18.240
Didn't you have air in your bloody tires?

10:18.720 --> 10:20.720
What's the matter with you,
you great lump?

10:20.720 --> 10:24.960
Right, yeah, I did, I parked right next to
a place where a bomb went off, Mrs. H.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.480
Don't you Mrs. H me, you cheeky sod.

10:27.480 --> 10:30.440
I paid you for 40 bottles
and I bloody well want them.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.120
What a day.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.600
You smashed my Whiskey,

10:35.160 --> 10:36.640
the heating is knackered,

10:36.960 --> 10:41.000
and the girls won't go on stage
because it's so bleeding cold.

10:41.520 --> 10:43.000
And to top it all off,

10:43.280 --> 10:47.480
tonight's magician has just been
arrested as a deserter.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.360
I'm f--

10:50.480 --> 10:55.480
Erm, I wonder if I might be able to
help you out on behalf of my...

10:56.240 --> 10:57.480
erm, good friend here.

10:57.480 --> 11:03.120
I am no stranger
to the art of prestidigitation.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.680
Right, here is the deal.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.800
I can grant you temporary license

11:11.800 --> 11:14.800
to go back up to Earth
as zombies for 24 hours.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.440
- As zombies?
- Zombies, yes, the living dead.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.240
Then if you are able to find me hard proof

11:21.240 --> 11:24.240
that the demon Crowley and this Mr. Fell,

11:24.240 --> 11:26.760
who from your description
appears to be an Angel,

11:26.760 --> 11:30.320
are not just associating
but actively working together,

11:30.320 --> 11:33.560
I will be authorized to grant you freedom
from Hell and Damnation.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.840
What if this Angel, Mr. Fell,
uses his heavenly powers against us?

11:39.120 --> 11:42.560
No worry about that, I recently qualified
as an authorized miracle blocker.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.840
I can stop all that very easily, but...

11:44.840 --> 11:46.360
if you don't want to do it, no problem,

11:46.640 --> 11:48.520
the alternative is this.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.160
Oh!

11:50.160 --> 11:52.520
Not him, that's Asterik,
he just brought me the clicker.

11:52.520 --> 11:53.600
Thank you.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.680
- A spider's web?
- Give me a minute, it's fiddly.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.160
Comandant Klupps.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.800
You'd be passed through
this spider's digestive system,

12:16.800 --> 12:18.400
expelled as faecal matter,

12:18.400 --> 12:20.360
reconstituted as a Nazi headed fly

12:20.360 --> 12:22.080
and the whole sorry business is repeated.

12:22.520 --> 12:23.520
For how long?

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
Let me check for you.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.000
Eternity. So, if you'd rather take

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
the initial 24 hours
as a living dead on Earth,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.200
just sign here, otherwise it's straight
through there for spinne time.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.600
So...

12:40.640 --> 12:42.480
what do we do when we find the proof?

12:43.200 --> 12:45.000
Just twist the jewel on this,

12:45.880 --> 12:47.840
that summons me, I'll be right there.

12:49.760 --> 12:50.760
And then what?

12:50.760 --> 12:52.400
Well, I should be the one
to collect the proof

12:52.400 --> 12:54.040
with this state of the art device.

12:54.880 --> 12:55.880
All done.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.000
As newly inculcated members of the undead,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
you will experience periods of blood lust
which you will have to satisfy.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.320
These cravings can only be quenched
by the consumption of living human brains,

13:04.320 --> 13:06.800
just to keep you going. Any questions?

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
Good.

Cheers for getting me off the hook.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.840
Oh, there's no need
to thank me, that's what...

16:04.000 --> 16:05.040
friends

16:05.480 --> 16:06.520
are for.

16:08.400 --> 16:12.760
You're aware that you're going to be
performing on the West End Stage tonight?

16:13.200 --> 16:16.600
<i>♪ The West End, the West End... ♪</i>

16:16.880 --> 16:18.760
It's just that those stages
take some filling.

16:19.560 --> 16:21.800
You're talking to the Angel

16:22.040 --> 16:23.800
who fooled Nefertiti

16:23.800 --> 16:26.720
with a lone caraway seed
on three cowry shells.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.240
Aha! Professor Hoffmann's modern magic.

16:30.520 --> 16:31.680
Ah, there you are.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.800
"To Mr. Fell," that's me,

16:38.800 --> 16:40.760
"a wonderful student."

16:42.400 --> 16:45.240
We must know what they are saying.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.640
Let me look,
I'm an expert lip reader.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.240
Hand me those.

16:56.720 --> 16:57.720
Go on, then.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.960
I'm a lonely GI
anxiously awaiting the arrival

17:01.960 --> 17:04.800
of the Ladies of Camelot. Amaze me.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.320
Yeah, erm...

17:06.320 --> 17:08.520
Go on, Mr. British man,

17:08.840 --> 17:11.000
wow me with your miracles.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.760
Can I just say that I do

17:14.240 --> 17:17.720
only allow myself one tiny weeny miracle?

17:17.960 --> 17:20.640
Just to warm the audience and myself.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.200
Erm...

17:22.960 --> 17:23.960
For instance,

17:24.680 --> 17:26.560
turning a common turnip

17:27.240 --> 17:28.800
into an inkwell.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.320
But before...

17:31.680 --> 17:33.080
that, everything...

17:33.320 --> 17:35.680
I do is accomplished by...

17:36.680 --> 17:38.080
skillful conjuring alone.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.160
Now...
I have here

17:41.040 --> 17:42.560
a sixpence

17:45.280 --> 17:47.320
and a farthing.

17:49.560 --> 17:50.560
But...

17:50.680 --> 17:54.080
if I close my hand thusly,

17:55.080 --> 17:57.520
for but a blink of an eye...

17:58.920 --> 18:00.040
Well?

18:00.040 --> 18:02.160
- What is he saying?
- He says...

18:02.960 --> 18:04.800
- Banana.
- Banana.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.320
- Fish.
- Fish.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.080
- Gorilla.
- Gorilla.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.800
- Shoe lace.
- Shoe lace.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.320
A dash of nutmeg.

18:14.440 --> 18:18.640
Banana, fish, gorilla,
shoe lace with a dash of nutmeg.

18:21.640 --> 18:22.720
And...

18:23.920 --> 18:25.240
The farthing...

18:25.720 --> 18:27.960
has vanished.

18:29.800 --> 18:30.800
Right.

18:32.160 --> 18:34.560
What you just did is remarkable,

18:34.560 --> 18:39.000
I don't have the foggiest notion
how it's done.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.320
But that's a trick
for close quarters, eh?

18:43.760 --> 18:45.680
What you do tonight has to be bigger.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.280
I see, yeah, you're right, of course.

18:49.280 --> 18:52.240
We need something new, something dramatic.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.440
You know if there's somewhere we can...

18:54.920 --> 18:56.320
I don't know, buy tricks.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.280
Well, there is ah...
Will Goldstone's magic shop.

18:59.280 --> 19:02.680
But that's for
professional conjurers only.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.400
You, my Nefertiti fooling fellow,

19:07.400 --> 19:11.480
are about to perform
on the West End Stage.

19:12.960 --> 19:16.520
If that doesn't make you
a professional conjurer,

19:17.400 --> 19:18.640
I don't know what does.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.080
Oh, that's marvelous, sir.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.000
- Are you familiar with it?
- No.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.080
Well, please hand me the contents
and I will gladly show you.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.080
A lot of fun that,
a lot of fun.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.880
- And it's only two and six.
- Oh, well, that's...

20:13.280 --> 20:15.280
not the sort of thing we're looking for.

20:15.280 --> 20:17.760
I need a showstopper.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.040
Erm, oh.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.160
Like these beauties.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.800
Oh, yes.

20:25.920 --> 20:28.200
You see, I do have a gift for prop--

20:28.640 --> 20:29.640
Erm.

20:30.280 --> 20:34.960
Well, a sort of natural dexterity.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.560
What about this?

20:45.920 --> 20:48.880
We call this one
the professor's nightmare.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.080
Now, I've got a big piece of rope,

20:51.080 --> 20:52.320
a medium size piece...

20:52.640 --> 20:54.800
Ah, with you in a few moments, sir.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.560
And a wee baby piece.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.920
Now, if I gather up the ends here,

20:59.280 --> 21:02.280
and collect all of the unequal ends here,

21:02.680 --> 21:03.800
a little tug,

21:04.520 --> 21:07.400
and they all stretch to become
exactly the same length.

21:07.400 --> 21:11.000
You see the big piece is the same length
as the medium size piece

21:11.000 --> 21:13.320
and the short piece is the same length
as the other two.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.280
See, this one here,
this one is the long piece.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.320
You can tell it apart
from the others, right?

21:17.760 --> 21:20.280
Perhaps is the light.
You see, there's the long piece,

21:20.280 --> 21:23.040
there's the medium piece,
and there's the short piece.

21:23.320 --> 21:26.760
Now this is perfect
for a talented amateur such as yourself.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.240
A talented amateur?

21:28.680 --> 21:31.080
Well, I'll have you know
I'm booked to appear in the West End.

21:31.320 --> 21:34.800
Erm, the Windmill theater
at 8:30 p.m. tonight.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.320
Thank you very much.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.960
I'm looking for something
with a bit more scale.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.480
Something climactic.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.640
Like that.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.000
A Bullet Catch, lovely.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.200
No, no, no.
I'm afraid that's not for you, sir.

21:52.960 --> 21:56.520
- What about this?
- No, no, I've found my showstopper.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.160
- How much is it?
- You do not understand.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.680
Twelve people have died
presenting this effect.

22:01.680 --> 22:05.720
Years ago, I sold one to a lovely Chinese
fella and he ended up six foot under.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.720
I'd hate to see
the same thing happen to you.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.560
- How much?
- Are you sure?

22:10.360 --> 22:12.680
- Are you sure you are sure?
- Quite sure. How much?

22:13.640 --> 22:14.640
Two pound ten.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.200
And another four pound 15 shillings
for the rifle.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.520
But you'll need a firearms license.

22:19.520 --> 22:20.960
Oh, I have one of those already.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.760
- You what?
- Oh, yes, I keep a Derringer

22:24.760 --> 22:28.080
in the bookshop,
inside a hollowed out book.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.120
In case I get into a scrape.

22:30.120 --> 22:31.680
You read too many books.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.160
And seven pounds, and...

22:36.400 --> 22:37.880
five shillings.

22:38.280 --> 22:41.200
Your life is worth a lot more
than seven pounds five shillings.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.440
Well, is a life worth more than...

22:44.920 --> 22:47.040
27 pounds and five shillings?

22:50.520 --> 22:51.600
On your head be it.

22:52.360 --> 22:53.800
I mean, I have warned you.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.360
It'll take a miracle for you
to be able to perform this safely tonight.

22:56.360 --> 22:57.760
That's why you just sell us the trick.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.480
Leave the miracles to us.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.560
You don't understand, look.

23:03.920 --> 23:04.920
Where are we?

23:07.560 --> 23:09.920
Here, you need nerves of steel.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.800
And a hand as steady
as the rock of Gibraltar.

23:13.480 --> 23:14.800
Well, I have those.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.600
Sir, go and take a look
at the pocket tricks over there, go on.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.880
I'll be with you in a minute.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.960
You're going to need
a 100% reliable marksman.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.040
Someone you can really trust.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.240
Otherwise, it's lethal.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.400
Oh, I've got the perfect man for the job.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.360
At least,

23:34.200 --> 23:36.640
I think I have...
excuse me, for one minute.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.960
You'll do the shooting,
I'll catch the bullet.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.840
I'll do all the hard bits.

23:45.440 --> 23:49.880
As a demon, you must have
fired off a lot of guns, yeah?

23:55.560 --> 23:56.800
- I'll do it.
- Yay.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.280
But if anything goes wrong,
can we agree that we break your...

24:00.280 --> 24:02.000
one miracle limit?

24:02.600 --> 24:05.120
Neither of us wants the paperwork, do we?

24:29.440 --> 24:32.760
Excuse me, sir. Fake ears
are two shillings, thank you very much.

24:34.600 --> 24:35.960
It's not fake.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.720
It's my own.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.120
I didn't mean it, sir.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.040
I mean,

24:41.040 --> 24:42.120
take everything you want.

24:42.800 --> 24:43.800
It's my treat.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.520
Sir?

24:47.040 --> 24:48.120
Sir?

24:48.120 --> 24:49.760
Please. Sir!

25:19.920 --> 25:22.680
<i>And now,
a master of misdirection,</i>

25:22.920 --> 25:24.920
<i>marvelous in his mysteriosity,</i>

25:25.200 --> 25:26.800
<i>with miracles at his fingertips.</i>

25:27.040 --> 25:30.720
<i>Let us welcome
the death defying prestidigitation</i>

25:30.720 --> 25:33.880
<i>of the amazing Mr. Fell.</i>

25:33.880 --> 25:36.520
You're on. Get on with it.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.400
Those were the Ladies of Camelot,

25:52.320 --> 25:53.880
they're the bees knees.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.680
I bet you're all thinking,

25:57.360 --> 25:59.640
"What's that man doing up there,

26:00.880 --> 26:01.880
on the stage?

26:02.680 --> 26:05.560
Is he here to amaze and befuddle us all

26:05.560 --> 26:07.520
with his prestidigitation

26:08.440 --> 26:09.960
and jiggery-pokery?"

26:09.960 --> 26:11.880
- Get on with it!
- Oh.

26:11.880 --> 26:12.960
Erm...

26:13.480 --> 26:16.120
Well, the answer is, yes, I am.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.200
Erm...

26:17.840 --> 26:18.880
To amaze you,

26:19.600 --> 26:21.320
first, I shall require

26:21.920 --> 26:24.080
the assistance of a gentleman

26:24.400 --> 26:25.920
from the audience. Now,

26:26.320 --> 26:30.120
is anyone here
familiar with using firearms?

26:34.320 --> 26:35.320
Oh.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.720
Erm...

26:41.880 --> 26:43.560
Erm... you, sir!

26:44.280 --> 26:46.440
You look like
you might have a steady hand.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.120
- Yep.
- Ah.

26:48.120 --> 26:51.600
Erm, yep, we'll escort you up
onto the stage.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.840
Erm...

26:57.280 --> 26:58.640
Before we-- thank you.

27:02.560 --> 27:03.720
Before we begin,

27:05.080 --> 27:07.160
we just need
a little something

27:07.880 --> 27:08.880
to check

27:09.280 --> 27:10.360
that the magic

27:10.760 --> 27:11.760
is working

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
today.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.280
Miracles blocked.

27:20.320 --> 27:21.840
What have we here?

27:22.320 --> 27:23.560
A common or garden turnip.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.520
But in a blink,

27:27.200 --> 27:30.200
and before your very eyes,

27:30.640 --> 27:32.160
I transform it

27:32.720 --> 27:35.560
into an inkwell.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.760
What on earth is he playing at?

27:41.240 --> 27:44.080
- I thought you said he was a magician.
- He is.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.520
I say again.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.440
From turnip

27:49.240 --> 27:51.120
to inkwell.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.880
Oh, well.

28:04.760 --> 28:05.760
Sometimes...

28:06.880 --> 28:07.880
you meet a...

28:08.200 --> 28:09.200
stubborn turnip.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.520
So...

28:11.000 --> 28:12.600
best get on to the main event.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.040
Tonight...

28:15.160 --> 28:17.440
I will take my life in my hands,

28:18.040 --> 28:20.160
as I dare to perform...

28:21.120 --> 28:22.520
the bullet catch!

28:26.360 --> 28:28.080
A round of applause for

28:28.760 --> 28:30.560
this total stranger.

28:37.640 --> 28:38.640
Yeah.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.640
- My miracles aren't working.
- Neither are mine.

28:42.640 --> 28:45.400
Now, would you be so good

28:45.920 --> 28:47.120
as to...

28:48.040 --> 28:49.680
take this rifle...

28:50.640 --> 28:52.000
Ah!

28:52.440 --> 28:57.280
The gentlemen of the press
are intrigued already, I see.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.360
- Now, sir...
- Got you.

29:02.600 --> 29:06.000
...I would ask that you take this bullet

29:06.520 --> 29:08.640
and load it into the rifle.

29:10.120 --> 29:12.040
Very carefully.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.480
It's perfectly simple. Aim for my mouth,

29:19.240 --> 29:20.680
but shoot past my ear.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.920
I just squeeze that there, do I not?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.280
Haven't you fired a gun before?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.680
Not as such.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.160
If you would...

29:35.800 --> 29:39.080
load the bullet into the gun.

29:40.720 --> 29:41.720
That's right.

29:42.320 --> 29:44.560
Bullet loaded!

29:44.920 --> 29:45.920
Yes, thank you.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.720
Ladies and gentleman,

29:49.280 --> 29:50.480
my volunteer

29:51.160 --> 29:52.600
here, will on...

29:53.680 --> 29:54.880
on my signal,

29:56.240 --> 29:58.920
fire the rifle at my head,

29:59.280 --> 30:01.240
and in that explosive moment,

30:01.920 --> 30:05.000
I will attempt to catch that bullet

30:05.000 --> 30:08.720
in my teeth!

30:15.600 --> 30:17.040
Are you ready, sir?

30:18.880 --> 30:21.400
When you hear my signal, sir,

30:22.360 --> 30:23.400
shoot.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.640
Ready?

30:34.640 --> 30:35.720
Of course, we are hooked.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.160
Aim.

30:41.480 --> 30:43.880
If that gun goes off in his face,
now it'll be a right old mess.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.640
Never mind the paperwork,
they probably won't be able

30:45.640 --> 30:47.200
to put him back together again.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.280
Get on with it, for God's sake.

31:13.320 --> 31:14.320
Fire!

31:20.800 --> 31:21.800
What the f...

31:31.320 --> 31:32.320
Thank you!

31:33.640 --> 31:35.200
No paperwork.

31:35.640 --> 31:37.000
Oh, thank you.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.920
Thank you!

31:39.840 --> 31:41.520
Oh, thank you!

31:44.320 --> 31:46.760
Get on, girls, for God's sake.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.400
But do you really think it went well?

31:50.400 --> 31:51.920
Absolutely.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.000
Chalk up a win for the side of the Angels.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.400
Ah!

31:55.400 --> 31:57.320
Enter.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.960
Hmm, well, well, well...

32:05.320 --> 32:06.720
What have we here?

32:07.520 --> 32:08.560
Sorry, have we met?

32:08.560 --> 32:10.760
Oh, no, you never had the pleasure, but...

32:10.760 --> 32:13.000
we have, haven't we?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.080
Have we?

32:14.360 --> 32:15.840
What do you mean "have we?"
You know we have.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.400
We were in the same legion.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.440
Just before the fall.

32:20.880 --> 32:22.640
Doing dubious battle
on the plains of Heaven.

32:24.600 --> 32:25.600
Remember?

32:26.320 --> 32:29.800
I remember going into battle,
I don't remember being there with you.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.360
Sorry.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.000
I was right next to you.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.840
We did loads together.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.040
You said jump on me back
like a monkey in a waist coat.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.640
Anyway, whether you do
or whether you don't, it doesn't matter.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.080
I'm here to inform you,

32:46.040 --> 32:48.040
as a representative
of the high powers of Hell,

32:48.040 --> 32:49.560
that you, Crowley,

32:50.120 --> 32:52.800
are in breach of the infernal code.

32:54.080 --> 32:57.280
Consulting and collaborating
with an Angel,

32:58.480 --> 33:00.880
Fell the Marvelous, aka...

33:05.000 --> 33:06.160
Azirapalala.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.320
Azirapapap.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.360
Aziphapalala.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.000
Aziraphale.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.800
Pure coincidence. I happen to be here,

33:15.160 --> 33:16.720
he asked for a volunteer.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.920
The miraculous Bullet Catch

33:21.920 --> 33:25.200
requires the use
of a trusted stooge and confidant.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.840
Where did you get that booklet?

33:27.480 --> 33:30.360
It's only available
to working professional magicians,

33:30.600 --> 33:31.920
such as myself.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.040
Be it be.

33:45.680 --> 33:49.080
Got it from the man in the magic shop
just after you left.

33:49.360 --> 33:53.680
It was... [laughs] his last wish
that we should have it.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.320
But you're dead.

33:57.280 --> 33:58.280
Living dead.

33:58.920 --> 33:59.920
Now,

34:00.160 --> 34:01.240
agents of Hell.

34:19.360 --> 34:21.160
Don't bother trying any funny business,

34:21.160 --> 34:23.880
I think you'll find someone
who has great authority

34:24.360 --> 34:27.640
has put a half hour miracle block
on this entire theater.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.160
- Who?
- Me! Who do you think?

34:31.360 --> 34:32.360
Come on, come on.

34:33.680 --> 34:34.680
Erm...

34:38.560 --> 34:39.840
All right, Crowley.

34:40.680 --> 34:43.440
- Shall we?
- Oh, we shan't, this is ridiculous.

34:43.840 --> 34:46.480
No, what's ridiculous is demons like you
doing what they please.

34:46.480 --> 34:49.080
And somehow still getting on,
while demons like me graft

34:49.080 --> 34:50.640
for hundreds and hundreds of millennia

34:50.640 --> 34:52.400
and never get a sniff of a promotion.

34:53.280 --> 34:54.440
Well, not this time.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.880
Expect a legion to come for you
first thing tomorrow.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.800
Enjoy your last night on Earth.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.200
But first, what about our deal?

35:08.280 --> 35:10.880
- Freedom from Damnation.
- Absolutely.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.120
You're free to go. Ta-da.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.960
But you can't leave us like this.

35:17.960 --> 35:20.760
You need to make us into living humans.

35:20.760 --> 35:23.160
Oh, no... clause 17.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.520
Un-revocable eternal life on Earth

35:26.640 --> 35:27.760
as zombies.

35:28.520 --> 35:29.520
Granted.

35:34.480 --> 35:35.960
Might be all right.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.120
Thank you for seeing me,
your maleficences.

35:50.120 --> 35:53.880
I took this photograph of
Crowley and Aziraphale together.

35:54.440 --> 35:57.040
So you have your audience
for the dark council then?

35:57.040 --> 35:59.000
There are vacancies in...

35:59.400 --> 36:00.400
Temptations?

36:04.480 --> 36:05.640
Indeed there are.

36:08.880 --> 36:12.560
But I'm afraid it looks like
you'll be staying right here.

36:12.920 --> 36:13.920
Eh?

36:16.360 --> 36:17.800
Oh, hang on, that's not...

36:20.640 --> 36:21.680
But...

36:29.680 --> 36:30.680
How?

36:32.000 --> 36:34.840
There was a miracle blocker in the room,
I saw you put it back in the envelope.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.040
Who needs a miracle when
you've had private lessons

36:37.040 --> 36:39.160
from the great Prof. Hoffmann himself.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.480
I simply say the magic words.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.080
Banana, fish, gorilla, shoe lace,

36:44.440 --> 36:47.160
with a dash of nutmeg, and...

36:51.560 --> 36:54.200
Well, I got it right
the time that mattered.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.320
You really are...

36:59.120 --> 37:00.520
terrible at magic.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.160
Shall we retire the act?

37:04.760 --> 37:05.800
Perhaps.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.880
- Might be for the best.
- Hmm.

37:10.440 --> 37:11.480
I...

37:12.600 --> 37:14.160
I knew you would come through for me.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.200
You always do.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.640
Well, you said "trust me."

37:19.760 --> 37:20.760
And you did.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.920
You could've walked away.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.000
If you were truly

37:27.320 --> 37:30.280
as evil as you like to paint yourself,
you would've done that.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.360
Nah.

37:32.160 --> 37:33.160
That's the trouble with you lot.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.920
You don't just see things
in black and white.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.360
Sometimes,

37:36.640 --> 37:38.160
you've just gotta blur the edges.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.120
Well, maybe there is something
to be said for.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.680
Shades of grey.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.600
Well, shades of...

37:51.080 --> 37:52.160
dark grey.

37:52.680 --> 37:54.520
Shades of a very light grey,

37:54.760 --> 37:56.000
I'd rather fancy.

38:19.640 --> 38:20.880
State your business.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.320
Oh, for Satan's sake, you know who I am.

38:25.680 --> 38:27.600
I have an appointment with Lord Beelzebub.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.400
State your business.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.800
I am Shax, demon of the fifth house,

38:36.040 --> 38:38.440
earthly representative of plenipotentiary

38:38.440 --> 38:40.280
of the vastness of Hell.

38:40.280 --> 38:42.360
Here to see Lord Beelzebub.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.640
Well,

38:45.200 --> 38:46.440
you're not on the list.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.480
What's up, babe?

38:52.640 --> 38:55.120
Let me in to see Lord Beelzebub

38:55.480 --> 38:59.160
or I will rearrange your vital organs
and hang them on the wall.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.120
In a frame.

39:04.640 --> 39:06.000
Ah, fair enough.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.280
Shax, demon of the fifth house.

39:16.880 --> 39:17.880
Well?

39:18.280 --> 39:19.400
What news?

39:19.680 --> 39:22.200
- The Angel went to Edinburgh.
- Which Angel?

39:22.320 --> 39:23.360
You know which one.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.040
Crowley's pet.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.520
- Why Edinburgh?
- Not sure.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.680
Maybe they want us to think
Gabriel is in Edinburgh.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.200
Maybe Crowley wants the Angel
to make us think Gabriel is in Edinburgh.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.960
- Maybe--
- Maybe he actually is in Edinburgh.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.800
- Oh, he's not in Edinburgh.
- Why not?

39:39.480 --> 39:40.640
Because he's in the bookshop.

39:42.640 --> 39:44.120
Gabriel's in the bookshop?

39:45.360 --> 39:46.520
You're certain of it?

39:46.520 --> 39:47.640
Yes.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.640
Thank you, Shax.

39:50.560 --> 39:51.600
Good work.

39:55.400 --> 39:56.400
Yes?

39:57.040 --> 39:58.560
Now that we've located Gabriel,

39:59.360 --> 40:00.360
what do we do?

40:01.000 --> 40:04.080
- Well, we formulate a plan.
- I formulated a plan.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.120
I take a legion of demons
and we storm the bookshop,

40:07.120 --> 40:09.680
killing anyone and anything
that stands in our way.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
We capture Gabriel
and we drag him as tribute

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
before the throne of Satan, our master.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.160
Can you enter the bookshop,

40:17.560 --> 40:18.600
without permission?

40:19.040 --> 40:20.560
Not technically, no.

40:21.480 --> 40:24.280
But give me a legion
of Hell's finest troops

40:24.280 --> 40:26.320
and see what I can do.

40:27.600 --> 40:30.640
It's a chance I've been waiting for,
Lord Beelzebub.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.440
To be clear,

40:33.760 --> 40:35.560
you are hereby authorizing me

40:35.560 --> 40:37.200
to storm the Angel's bookshop,

40:37.320 --> 40:39.760
sending wave after wave of demons

40:39.760 --> 40:42.520
to besiege it until it falls
and capture the Archangel,

40:43.040 --> 40:45.520
destroying anything and everything
that stands in our way?

40:46.120 --> 40:47.120
No.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.640
I am not authorizing you to do that.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.760
Oh.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.960
I am commanding you to do it.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.200
I want you there, Shax.

40:57.800 --> 40:58.960
On the ground.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.840
Bravely leading the attack
into the bookshop,

41:02.840 --> 41:05.520
leading the army of the damned.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.600
I can do that.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.520
Oh.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.360
Oi, you need to put your brakes on.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.120
Now go back to where I parked you.

42:02.760 --> 42:03.920
There you are!

42:04.360 --> 42:05.880
I was worried something
might've happened to you.

42:05.880 --> 42:07.400
Erm, no, nothing happened to me.

42:07.400 --> 42:10.280
Very uneventful journey indeed,
no strange things at all.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.160
Good, that's what we want to hear.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.680
Erm, everything okay with...?

42:15.280 --> 42:16.280
Oh, yeah, fine.

42:16.680 --> 42:17.760
He's singing to himself.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.400
I think he must've been asleep,

42:19.400 --> 42:21.160
I heard snoring coming from his bedroom.

42:21.280 --> 42:22.520
Did you miss me?

42:23.280 --> 42:24.520
I bet you did.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.160
- I'm sure it did.
- So...

42:27.760 --> 42:31.280
Any more clues from the mystery
of the missing Archangel?

42:31.600 --> 42:32.640
Not exactly.

42:32.960 --> 42:36.400
Or, if there are,
I haven't yet cracked the case.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.640
But I'm certainly hot
on the trail of something.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.160
I'm sure you are.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.520
Oh, by the way,

42:44.080 --> 42:47.280
the whole sudden rain and awning thing
was a complete washout.

42:47.640 --> 42:48.640
Sorry?

42:48.760 --> 42:50.400
You know, project

42:50.400 --> 42:52.160
making Nina fall in love with Maggie.

42:52.640 --> 42:53.840
I failed, it's your go.

42:53.840 --> 42:54.960
Oh, I see.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.400
Well, then.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.800
Whickber Street Traders
and Shopkeepers Association

42:58.800 --> 43:00.600
monthly meeting, here we come.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.560
You're really hosting the meeting?

43:02.840 --> 43:03.880
Absolutely.

43:04.280 --> 43:05.560
And I can guarantee you

43:05.560 --> 43:06.760
it will be a night

43:06.760 --> 43:08.040
to remember.
