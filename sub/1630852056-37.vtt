00:00.400 --> 00:03.065
[Judge Judy] This stimulus money
went into your checking account.

00:03.133 --> 00:04.200
Yes, ma'am.

00:04.266 --> 00:07.266
And she was supposed to give that
to your son, and she never did?

00:07.333 --> 00:09.532
She never gave him any of the money.

00:09.599 --> 00:11.599
He called me, "You need
to give me the money, did it..."

00:11.666 --> 00:13.666
I'm like, "I don't owe you anything."

00:13.734 --> 00:14.599
She took from me.

00:14.666 --> 00:15.632
She stole from me.

00:15.699 --> 00:16.966
This was not your money.

00:17.033 --> 00:18.667
Oh, yes, it was. Yes, ma'am.

00:18.734 --> 00:19.600
This is my money.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.734

00:41.066 --> 00:45.000
[announcer] Michelle Blake
is suing her son's ex-girlfriend,

00:45.066 --> 00:46.700
Shanovya Boyance,

00:46.767 --> 00:50.432
for bedroom furniture
and stimulus money.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.533
[Kevin] Court coming to order.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.332
[Judge Judy] Be seated, please.

00:56.933 --> 00:57.899
[Kevin] Hello, Judge.

00:57.966 --> 01:00.667
Case 1074. Blake versus Boyance.

01:00.734 --> 01:01.899
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:01.966 --> 01:02.933
[Judge Judy] Ms. Blake,

01:03.000 --> 01:07.299
Ms. Boyance
was the girlfriend of your son? Son?

01:07.367 --> 01:09.200
- [Michelle] Yes, ma'am.
- [Judge Judy] Stand up for a second.

01:09.266 --> 01:10.400
Stand next to your mom.

01:12.132 --> 01:14.567
How long were you
and Ms. Boyance in a relationship?

01:14.632 --> 01:16.200
About eight months.

01:16.265 --> 01:19.265
[Judge Judy] And you lived together
for all of that eight-month period?

01:19.332 --> 01:20.799
- [Antonio] Yes, ma'am.
- [Judge Judy] From when to when?

01:20.867 --> 01:23.432
I'm bad with dates, ma'am.
I'm sorry. I don't know the exact...

01:23.500 --> 01:25.966
I guarantee you,
she's gonna be able to tell me the date.

01:26.799 --> 01:27.734
- Date.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:27.799 --> 01:30.367
July was when we initially started dating.

01:30.432 --> 01:33.667
Um, we broke up March 17th,
to be exact.

01:33.734 --> 01:36.000
- When did you start living together?
- July.

01:36.066 --> 01:37.766
[Judge Judy]
And when did he move out?

01:37.834 --> 01:39.233
[Shanovya] March 17th, 2021.

01:39.299 --> 01:40.766
[Judge Judy]
Were you living in the apartment

01:40.834 --> 01:42.299
- before he moved in?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:42.366 --> 01:43.332
[Judge Judy]
So the lease was in your name?

01:43.400 --> 01:44.299
Correct.

01:44.366 --> 01:46.299
[Judge Judy] How long did you live there
before he moved in?

01:46.366 --> 01:50.099
[Shanovya]
I moved in in 2019, December.

01:50.165 --> 01:51.133
[Judge Judy]
And who were you living there with?

01:51.200 --> 01:52.133
Myself.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.200
[Judge Judy] Where were you working?

01:53.265 --> 01:54.799
Um, at that time,
I was working at Walmart.

01:54.866 --> 01:56.033
And what about you, sir?

01:56.099 --> 01:57.933
I work for a company called [indistinct].

01:58.000 --> 02:01.500
We make plastic
interior car parts for BMW.

02:01.566 --> 02:03.000
[Judge Judy] How long
have you been working for them?

02:03.066 --> 02:04.132
Roughly four months.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.900
While you were living together,
were you working?

02:06.966 --> 02:08.233
- On and off.
- Okay.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.567
Now, you can sit down for a second.

02:09.633 --> 02:11.699
Now, I'm gonna start
with what this case is about.

02:11.766 --> 02:15.366
Because now I know that you lived
together for a little less than a year,

02:15.432 --> 02:18.800
it was your apartment, the lease
was in your name, he moved in?

02:18.866 --> 02:20.099
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

02:20.165 --> 02:22.066
This is what your case is about,
Ms. Blake.

02:22.133 --> 02:25.366
It is your claim that prior
to their breaking up,

02:25.432 --> 02:27.599
when I say prior,
it could have been within minutes...

02:27.667 --> 02:29.066
- Yes, ma'am.
- ...of their breaking up,

02:29.133 --> 02:33.633
- you gave the defendant $500.
- Yes, ma'am.

02:33.699 --> 02:35.332
[Judge Judy]
And you say that that money

02:35.400 --> 02:37.866
was from a stimulus check.

02:37.933 --> 02:39.133
Yes, ma'am.

02:39.199 --> 02:42.366
And she was supposed
to give that $500 to your son?

02:42.432 --> 02:43.866
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Judge Judy] And she never did?

02:43.933 --> 02:45.099
- No, ma'am.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.966
So that's the first part of your case.

02:47.033 --> 02:50.966
Second part of your case
is that when your son moved in

02:51.033 --> 02:53.033
to Ms. Boyance's apartment,

02:53.099 --> 02:57.165
- you gave them a bedroom set?
- Yes.

02:57.233 --> 02:58.699
[Judge Judy]
And since he's no longer there,

02:58.766 --> 03:00.432
- you want it back?
- Yes.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.834
That's the easy part
for me to address right now.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.066
I'll ask you a few rudimentary questions

03:06.133 --> 03:08.233
and then I'll explain what the problem is.

03:08.300 --> 03:11.734
When your son moved in
with the defendant,

03:11.800 --> 03:14.032
had he been using
that bedroom set at home?

03:14.099 --> 03:15.000
Yes, ma'am.

03:15.066 --> 03:16.332
[Judge Judy] So it was his bedroom set?

03:16.400 --> 03:19.300
Yes, ma'am.
Since he was nine years old.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.866
- [Judge Judy] So it belonged to him?
- Yes.

03:20.933 --> 03:22.199
[Judge Judy] Where is he living now?

03:22.265 --> 03:23.133
[Michelle] With me.

03:23.199 --> 03:24.300
[Judge Judy] What is he sleeping on?

03:24.366 --> 03:26.133
At first, it was the air mattress

03:26.199 --> 03:29.900
and then I replaced it with another set.

03:29.966 --> 03:32.500
Not the exact same set,
a cheaper model.

03:32.567 --> 03:35.866
Okay.
Well, let me explain to you about a gift.

03:35.933 --> 03:39.233
When you make a gift,
unless it's a conditional gift,

03:39.300 --> 03:40.699
you don't get it back.

03:40.766 --> 03:42.567
Now, she says she trashed it.

03:42.633 --> 03:43.900
I actually don't believe that.

03:43.966 --> 03:45.599
But even if she had it,

03:45.667 --> 03:49.265
you are the wrong plaintiff
because this bedroom set,

03:49.332 --> 03:52.834
according to you,
belonged to your son, not you.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.599
You may have bought it
when he was nine,

03:54.667 --> 03:59.199
but you made a gift of it to him
when he moved into her house.

03:59.265 --> 04:01.066
So you can't sue her for it

04:01.133 --> 04:04.133
because you have no interest
in that bedroom set.

04:04.199 --> 04:07.366
You know, it's a simple process in law.

04:07.432 --> 04:11.834
You have to have some right of title
to a property

04:11.900 --> 04:14.265
before you can sue for its return.

04:14.332 --> 04:16.432
And once you've made a gift of it,

04:16.500 --> 04:19.966
you no longer retain
any right to that property.

04:20.033 --> 04:21.699
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:21.766 --> 04:24.632
[Judge Judy]
Okay. Now let's deal with the $500.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.834
Where did the $500 come from?

04:26.899 --> 04:28.966
It came out my checking account.

04:29.033 --> 04:29.966
- It came from...
- [Judge Judy] From...

04:30.033 --> 04:32.533
- ...my stimulus check because he...
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.867
So you got a stimulus check?

04:33.933 --> 04:34.966
- Yes.
- [Judge Judy] In your name?

04:35.033 --> 04:36.699
- Yes.
- [Judge Judy] For how much?

04:36.766 --> 04:39.834
It was for 3,400.

04:39.899 --> 04:41.933
Well, that's a lot for a stimulus check.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.733
It was for me, him, and my husband.
Because...

04:45.800 --> 04:48.466
Okay. So you didn't get $3,400

04:48.533 --> 04:50.766
because that doesn't sound right to me.

04:50.834 --> 04:52.567
- No.
- [Judge Judy] How old is your son?

04:52.632 --> 04:54.500
- [Michelle] He is 20.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

04:54.567 --> 04:59.199
This account that you have,
is he on that account as a signatory?

04:59.266 --> 05:01.666
[Michelle]
No. I claimed him on my taxes.

05:01.733 --> 05:04.399
I got it. You claimed him
as a dependent on your taxes?

05:04.466 --> 05:05.867
Right.

05:05.934 --> 05:09.199
His stimulus money
went into your checking account

05:09.266 --> 05:13.333
and how much was the stimulus money
that your son received?

05:13.399 --> 05:14.666
$1,400.

05:14.733 --> 05:18.000
[Judge Judy] When it came,
did you have a discussion with your son?

05:18.065 --> 05:19.100
- Yes or no?
- Um, no.

05:19.165 --> 05:23.399
When for the first time
did you tell him...stand up.

05:23.466 --> 05:25.399
- Tell me your first name.
- Antonio.

05:25.466 --> 05:28.266
Antonio, when did your mom tell you

05:28.332 --> 05:30.899
that you had gotten
the stimulus money?

05:30.966 --> 05:34.367
It was after the fact
when she gave it to Shanovya.

05:34.432 --> 05:36.033
[Judge Judy]
So, she didn't tell you she had gotten it?

05:36.100 --> 05:37.100
[Antonio] No, ma'am.

05:37.165 --> 05:41.165
Now, between July of 2020, Antonio,

05:41.233 --> 05:44.966
and March of 2021,
were you employed?

05:45.033 --> 05:46.000
On and off.

05:46.066 --> 05:48.867
[Judge Judy] Were you
contributing to the household,

05:48.933 --> 05:50.000
- Ms. Boyance's household?
- [Antonio] Yes.

05:50.066 --> 05:51.367
How were you contributing?

05:51.432 --> 05:53.899
I would honestly
do what I could, you know.

05:53.966 --> 05:58.165
I was having my own problems,
stuff I needed to work on with myself,

05:58.233 --> 06:01.100
you know, growing up to do, you know.

06:01.165 --> 06:03.132
- Okay. Well, you're 20.
- [Antonio] Yeah.

06:03.199 --> 06:05.233
- That's...you're probably right.
- [Antonio] Getting myself together.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.300
You're probably right.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.233
- How old is Ms. Boyance?
- Twenty-one.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.666
[Judge Judy] Does she have it together?

06:10.934 --> 06:13.834
She has an apartment,
you know, I, I don't, maybe.

06:13.899 --> 06:16.132
Okay. So, your mother didn't tell you

06:16.199 --> 06:18.199
that you had gotten the stimulus money?

06:18.266 --> 06:19.399
I mean, I knew, kind of,

06:19.466 --> 06:22.132
but she tell me
that she gave it to Shanovya.

06:22.199 --> 06:24.867
She called me
that day she gave it to her.

06:24.934 --> 06:25.899
But I didn't ask.

06:25.966 --> 06:28.800
I'd like you to tell me
how it came about, Ms. Blake,

06:28.867 --> 06:34.399
that you gave the defendant $500
of your son's stimulus money.

06:34.466 --> 06:37.733
Well, I call Antonio. He didn't answer.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.933
So I called Shanovya and I told her,

06:41.000 --> 06:43.466
I said, "I got, you know,
my stimulus money.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.533
And I wanna give Antonio $500." She...

06:46.600 --> 06:49.033
Well, just a second.
Let's understand something.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.165
Unless you tell me
you were supporting him,

06:51.233 --> 06:53.367
you're not entitled to his stimulus money.

06:57.300 --> 06:58.500
I was helping both of them.

06:58.567 --> 07:00.567
They came to my job several times.

07:00.632 --> 07:02.432
And I gave both of them gift cards.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.199
I'm talking about $200.

07:04.266 --> 07:05.867
- I, I, I help them.
- [Judge Judy] Well, that's, that's okay.

07:05.934 --> 07:07.766
That's okay if you help them.

07:07.834 --> 07:08.766
You're his mother.

07:13.199 --> 07:16.199
[theme music playing]

07:19.733 --> 07:23.567
[announcer] Michelle Blake
is suing her son's ex-girlfriend,

07:23.632 --> 07:25.332
Shanovya Boyance,

07:25.399 --> 07:28.266
for bedroom furniture
and stimulus money.

07:28.332 --> 07:31.466
Now, you may have claimed him
as a dependent on your taxes,

07:31.533 --> 07:34.300
but if he's living independently of you,

07:34.367 --> 07:38.066
working on and off
or if he's living in her house

07:38.132 --> 07:41.332
and therefore, if she's paying
the rent and the utilities,

07:41.399 --> 07:43.432
and the gas, and electric, et cetera,

07:43.500 --> 07:46.600
she's really providing
the majority of his support,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.933
then that's not your stimulus money.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.800
He's an emancipated person
if he's living outside of your home,

07:52.867 --> 07:54.966
living, working, or not working

07:55.033 --> 07:58.800
but being supported
by somebody else, Ms. Blake,

07:58.867 --> 08:00.766
that really isn't your money.

08:00.834 --> 08:03.632
I want you to understand that
in your head.

08:03.699 --> 08:06.733
Once he's out of your house,
he's not a dependent anymore.

08:06.800 --> 08:07.766
Do you understand?

08:07.834 --> 08:10.733
Unless you tell me
that you are paying half her rent,

08:10.800 --> 08:14.399
you were paying half of her utilities
on his behalf,

08:14.466 --> 08:16.065
because they were just
the two of them living there.

08:16.132 --> 08:17.432
Does that make sense to you?

08:17.500 --> 08:19.800
Yeah, that makes sense
but I also was helping.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.165
I was helping both of them.

08:21.233 --> 08:24.867
They came, not one time,
they came to my job several times.

08:24.934 --> 08:28.766
And I gave both of them gift cards.
I'm talking about $200.

08:28.834 --> 08:30.567
- I, I, I help them.
- [Judge Judy] Well, that's, that's okay.

08:30.632 --> 08:32.399
That's okay if you help them.

08:32.466 --> 08:33.834
- You're his mother.
- Right.

08:33.899 --> 08:36.066
[Judge Judy] But you didn't pay the rent.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.432
How much is your rent?

08:37.500 --> 08:38.799
Eight-ninety-five.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.899
[Judge Judy]
Her rent is 900 bucks a month.

08:40.966 --> 08:43.500
Your son says, and he's very honest,

08:43.567 --> 08:45.966
he said, "You know,
I may have worked on and off,

08:46.033 --> 08:48.633
but I was really working on myself,

08:48.700 --> 08:51.066
putting myself
where I had to be as a grown-up,"

08:51.133 --> 08:52.734
but he was really living with her.

08:52.799 --> 08:57.165
So if you gave them gift cards,
that's not support, Ms. Blake.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.033
Okay. So let's go back a little bit.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.633
So, you got the stimulus money,
his $1,400,

09:02.700 --> 09:03.799
which should've gone to him.

09:03.866 --> 09:07.933
And you couldn't reach him,
so you called the defendant.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.533
And tell me about that conversation.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.933
I said, "Shanovya," um,
she was complaining

09:12.000 --> 09:13.899
that she was giving him gas money.

09:13.966 --> 09:16.734
I said, "So, I'll tell you what,
just come over to my job

09:16.799 --> 09:20.700
because I got this stimulus check.
And I'll give Antonio the $500."

09:20.767 --> 09:23.899
- And I told her, I said...
- [Judge Judy] Don't make...just...

09:23.966 --> 09:27.466
[Michelle] No. I told her...
I'm telling you exactly what I told her.

09:27.533 --> 09:30.466
I said, "Whatever he does with it
is what he do with it."

09:30.533 --> 09:33.600
Once I gave it to her
and she gave it to him.

09:33.667 --> 09:35.834
But the thing is, Judge Judy,

09:35.899 --> 09:38.165
she never gave him any of the money.

09:38.232 --> 09:41.466
Okay. That's what your problem is,

09:41.533 --> 09:44.200
- that the money was intended for him.
- Uh-hmm.

09:44.265 --> 09:47.734
[Judge Judy]
And when you gave it to her for him

09:47.799 --> 09:51.366
within 24 hours,
they were no longer a couple.

09:51.432 --> 09:55.667
They were in a...
Antonio had left the house before the 17.

09:55.734 --> 09:58.432
If I knew that,
I would've never put $500 in her name.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.399
[Judge Judy] Just a second.

09:59.466 --> 10:02.866
Antonio, did you leave the house
before the 17th of March?

10:02.933 --> 10:04.533
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Judge Judy] Where did you go?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.200
- Stay with my mom.
- [Judge Judy] Well, that's not so

10:06.265 --> 10:09.466
because she said if she knew
that you weren't together,

10:09.533 --> 10:11.833
she never would've given
the defendant money.

10:11.899 --> 10:14.332
But you say that
you went to stay in her house.

10:14.399 --> 10:15.767
- [Antonio] Yeah.
- That's not possible

10:15.833 --> 10:18.432
because then she would've known
that you weren't together.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.500
Do you...no, no. Don't talk to him.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

10:23.066 --> 10:24.133
- [Antonio] Yes, ma'am. I do.
- Okay.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.533
Because your mother lives in her house.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.567
- Uh-hmm.
- [Judge Judy] So she would know

10:26.633 --> 10:27.533
that you were there.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.966
So, your mother said

10:29.033 --> 10:32.567
they were broken up
way before March 17th.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.799
And I'm asking you if that's true,
you said, "Yes, ma'am."

10:35.866 --> 10:37.299
Yeah, I moved in with my mom.

10:37.366 --> 10:40.432
Right when I moved out,
I roommate with a friend.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.567
Okay. There we go. You see?

10:43.933 --> 10:44.933
Yes, ma'am.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.734
You got a little work to do, Antonio.

10:46.799 --> 10:50.299
All right. On what date
did you move in with this friend?

10:50.366 --> 10:52.000
I think the 18th.

10:52.066 --> 10:54.834
[Judge Judy] So right
from Ms. Boyance's house,

10:54.899 --> 10:56.734
- you went to this friend's house?
- [Antonio] Yeah.

10:56.799 --> 10:58.767
[Judge Judy]
How long did you stay with the friend?

10:58.834 --> 11:00.899
It wasn't even a couple days.

11:00.966 --> 11:02.933
[Judge Judy] And after a couple of days,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.432
how did you notify your mother
that you will...

11:05.500 --> 11:06.533
wanted to come home?

11:06.600 --> 11:07.966
I can get in contact with her.

11:08.033 --> 11:10.466
It was just the time
when she called for the money,

11:10.533 --> 11:11.734
I didn't answer it at the time.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.066
- Hi.
- [Judge Judy] On the 17th,

11:16.133 --> 11:18.332
you picked up the money,
what did you do with it?

11:18.399 --> 11:20.533
[Shanovya] Um, I paid bills
that same day, which...

11:20.600 --> 11:21.533
[Judge Judy] What bills?

11:21.600 --> 11:24.600
Um, I paid the electric
from Georgia Power.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.700
I paid, um, Spectrum,

11:26.767 --> 11:29.299
which is the internet, my car insurance.

11:29.366 --> 11:30.767
And I gave him a hundred.

11:30.833 --> 11:33.399
[Judge Judy] Antonio, on the 17th,

11:33.466 --> 11:35.966
- did the defendant give you $100?
- Yes, ma'am.

11:36.033 --> 11:38.033
- Through cash app.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

11:38.100 --> 11:40.432
So I assume at that time

11:40.500 --> 11:43.366
that if she gave you the $100
through a cash app,

11:43.432 --> 11:45.966
you had some sort of discussion with her

11:46.033 --> 11:50.232
about why she was giving you money
towards the cash app, Antonio.

11:50.299 --> 11:53.366
- Let's move this along a little bit.
- Yes, ma'am. I...

11:53.432 --> 11:54.700
[Judge Judy] Okay.
Because there are certain things

11:54.767 --> 11:57.533
that make sense and certain things
that don't make sense.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.667
So, you're still living together
at this time, on the 17th.

12:01.734 --> 12:02.667
Yes, ma'am.

12:02.734 --> 12:05.166
[Judge Judy] So, at some point,
you must've had a discussion with her

12:05.232 --> 12:06.432
that went something like,

12:06.500 --> 12:10.332
"I got $500 from your mother,
from your stimulus check."

12:10.399 --> 12:11.933
- No?
- No, ma'am.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.567
[Judge Judy] Okay.
When you got this $100 in your cash app

12:15.633 --> 12:17.833
or whatever it is,
I don't understand those things. But I...

12:17.899 --> 12:20.066
[Antonio] That was
when I came back to her house,

12:20.133 --> 12:21.567
- trying to get the money.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

12:21.633 --> 12:24.000
After you split up,
you came back to the house

12:24.066 --> 12:27.000
and she said,
"I'll give you 100 of the 500."

12:27.066 --> 12:28.866
Don't speak.

12:28.933 --> 12:31.533
"I'll give you 100 of the 500."

12:31.600 --> 12:33.834
- $100 was all she sent.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

12:33.899 --> 12:36.299
Did you say to her,
"Where's the other money?"

12:36.366 --> 12:37.767
- Yes.
- [Judge Judy] You did?

12:37.834 --> 12:38.667
- Yes.
- [Judge Judy] Did you say that

12:38.734 --> 12:41.100
to her in text,
"Where's the rest of the money?"

12:41.165 --> 12:42.933
- Pretty sure I did.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.767
Just curious.
Did you get any texts from him?

12:45.834 --> 12:47.033
"Where is the rest of the money?"

12:47.100 --> 12:48.100
- No, ma'am.
- [Judge Judy] All right.

12:48.165 --> 12:51.399
You want to tell me how it came about
that you gave him the $100?

12:51.466 --> 12:53.466
Yes, ma'am.
So actually, it was three days later

12:53.533 --> 12:55.500
that I sent him the $100 due to the fact

12:55.567 --> 12:57.600
that I made sure
all the bills got paid first.

12:57.667 --> 13:00.232
When I gave him the $100,
it was through cash app,

13:00.299 --> 13:02.500
he didn't call me after
me and her had a conversation.

13:02.567 --> 13:04.533
She hung up with me,
called him and told him

13:04.600 --> 13:05.799
that she gave me the money.

13:05.866 --> 13:07.899
After me and her discussed
that we would not tell him

13:07.966 --> 13:10.332
because he did not know
how to spend the money correctly.

13:10.399 --> 13:13.200
And that the only thing he needed
was the gas money. So...

13:13.265 --> 13:14.833
[Judge Judy] Well, this was
when you were still together.

13:14.899 --> 13:15.833
We weren't still together.

13:15.899 --> 13:17.533
I have picture evidence
that can show what it is...

13:17.600 --> 13:18.567
- [Judge Judy] Well, just a second.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:18.633 --> 13:19.966
[Judge Judy]
If you weren't still together,

13:20.033 --> 13:23.366
then why would she give you the $500?

13:23.432 --> 13:25.133
I guess he didn't communicate to her.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.399
When she called me,
I explained to her the day...

13:27.466 --> 13:28.767
the beginning of the day,
which was when I was...

13:28.833 --> 13:29.667
[Judge Judy] Okay. She called you

13:29.734 --> 13:30.966
- on the 17th in the morning.
- [Shanovya] Yes, ma'am.

13:31.033 --> 13:31.966
- [Judge Judy] Tell me what...
- Correct.

13:32.033 --> 13:32.899
[Judge Judy]
Tell me what the conversation was about.

13:32.966 --> 13:35.533
Um, I was at work,
she called and she asked me,

13:35.600 --> 13:37.432
- um, did we need anything?
- [Judge Judy] Just a second.

13:37.500 --> 13:38.899
Do we know
what day the 17th of March?

13:38.966 --> 13:40.299
- A Wednesday.
- Wednesday.

13:40.366 --> 13:42.667
[Shanovya] Correct.
She asked me, did we need anything?

13:42.734 --> 13:45.567
Um, as always,
I would tell her, "You know, I need help

13:45.633 --> 13:47.399
because he does not pay anything.

13:47.466 --> 13:48.933
He doesn't help me with anything."

13:49.000 --> 13:51.667
So I didn't ask her necessarily...
I didn't call her.

13:51.734 --> 13:54.200
She called me and asked me,
I gave her, you know, a response.

13:54.265 --> 13:55.866
I told her,
"Yes, I'm giving him gas money.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.066
I'm feeding him,
I'm putting clothes on him,

13:58.133 --> 14:01.399
making sure he has all his necessities
and I get nothing out of that.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.734
So she was like,
"Okay. Well, I got the 500,"

14:03.799 --> 14:05.533
you know,
she didn't tell me where it came from.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.767
She told me to come pick it up.

14:06.833 --> 14:09.100
I told her I will let her know
because like I said, I was at work.

14:09.166 --> 14:12.000
I ended up having to go
pick up a coworker and I text her I say,

14:12.066 --> 14:14.299
"Hey, uh, is it okay
if I come and get it now?"

14:14.366 --> 14:15.265
She said, "Yes."

14:15.332 --> 14:17.066
Three days later, when she finds out,

14:17.133 --> 14:20.332
I guess she finally gets in contact
with him, they discuss it,

14:20.399 --> 14:22.533
he calls me, "You need to give me
the money," da-da-da,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.633
I'm like, "I don't owe you anything.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.366
I gave you a hundred for gas.

14:26.432 --> 14:29.332
And if anything,
that 100 should be able to last you,

14:29.399 --> 14:30.600
and I paid the bills."

14:30.667 --> 14:32.432
- But he wasn't living with you?
- Correct.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.200
[Judge Judy] But those were bills
from when he was living with you?

14:34.265 --> 14:35.767
- Correct.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

14:38.966 --> 14:40.533
This was not your money.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.500
- Oh, yes, it was...
- [Judge Judy] No.

14:41.567 --> 14:43.133
...my money. I pay his bills.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.165
[Judge Judy] Ms. Blake,
if you want to continue to spoil him,

14:46.232 --> 14:47.767
you could do that till he's 50.

14:47.834 --> 14:50.866
But that doesn't mean
he's not an emancipated person.

14:55.533 --> 14:58.533
[theme music playing]

15:02.734 --> 15:06.533
[announcer] Michelle Blake
is accusing her son's ex-girlfriend,

15:06.600 --> 15:08.066
Shanovya Boyance,

15:08.133 --> 15:10.600
of keeping her son's bedroom furniture

15:10.667 --> 15:13.700
and using his stimulus money
on herself.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.899
Antonio, while you were living
with the defendant,

15:16.966 --> 15:18.700
- who was paying the rent?
- Shanovya.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.200
[Judge Judy]
Who was paying the utilities?

15:20.265 --> 15:21.166
[Antonio] Shanovya.

15:21.232 --> 15:22.966
Honestly, she paid
the majority of the bills.

15:23.033 --> 15:25.399
- I just gave what I could.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

15:25.466 --> 15:28.299
So she paid the majority
of your living expenses.

15:28.366 --> 15:29.399
Yes, ma'am.

15:29.466 --> 15:31.833
[Judge Judy] So, when the government,

15:31.899 --> 15:34.899
because you weren't working full-time,

15:34.966 --> 15:37.033
gives you stimulus money,

15:37.100 --> 15:38.734
and you were still together,

15:38.799 --> 15:41.066
I must assume that your intention

15:41.133 --> 15:43.133
was to use that stimulus money

15:43.200 --> 15:45.033
the way it was intended,

15:45.100 --> 15:46.899
which was for your living expenses.

15:46.966 --> 15:47.866
Yes, ma'am.

15:47.933 --> 15:49.667
[Judge Judy]
Because when I deal with this now

15:49.734 --> 15:54.399
'cause this case is before me now,
you actually, Ms. Blake,

15:54.466 --> 15:57.299
are the wrong person to be suing her.

15:57.366 --> 16:00.734
This stimulus $1,400
didn't belong to you.

16:00.799 --> 16:03.166
You didn't support your son
for the year that...

16:03.232 --> 16:04.299
Yes, ma'am, I did.

16:04.366 --> 16:05.700
[Judge Judy] Well, show me.

16:05.767 --> 16:08.332
I can show you...I can show you...
I paid his car payment.

16:08.399 --> 16:09.799
I paid his car insurance.

16:09.866 --> 16:11.966
I paid his, um, cell phone bill.

16:12.033 --> 16:14.100
I paid them since he's been driving a car.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.366
- Just a...just a...
- [Michelle] I pay everything.

16:16.432 --> 16:18.033
[Judge Judy] No. Take the car away.

16:18.100 --> 16:20.833
He lives with the defendant.

16:20.899 --> 16:23.533
You wanna see to it
that he has a car, that's fine.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.633
You're his mother,
he'll always be your child.

16:25.700 --> 16:28.200
If he's 35 years old, he'll be your child.

16:28.265 --> 16:31.399
if you want to buy him ski lift tickets

16:31.466 --> 16:34.700
when he's 40 years old
and they cost $1,000,

16:34.767 --> 16:35.799
you can do that.

16:35.866 --> 16:37.165
But that's not supporting him.

16:37.232 --> 16:39.299
Supporting him
is putting a roof over his head,

16:39.366 --> 16:43.966
making sure he has gas,
electric, water, food,

16:44.033 --> 16:45.265
all of those things. You pay...

16:45.332 --> 16:47.232
- I did that for both of them.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.332
[Michelle]
I gave them food. I did everything.

16:49.399 --> 16:51.600
I, I've bent over backwards
for this young lady.

16:51.667 --> 16:52.799
- I never thought...
- [Judge Judy] Let's just...

16:52.866 --> 16:55.066
[Michelle] ...that this young lady
would do what she did to me.

16:55.133 --> 16:56.633
- [Judge Judy] Okay. I have to take...
- And what...and I felt like

16:56.700 --> 16:58.033
she took from me, that's what I felt.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.834
- I felt like she stole for me.
- [Judge Judy] Ms. Blake. Miss...

16:59.899 --> 17:02.600
[Michelle] And this conversation
that she's having with you right now,

17:02.667 --> 17:04.733
that's not the conversation
we had on Wednesday.

17:04.799 --> 17:07.133
She didn't...
I didn't ask her did she need anything,

17:07.200 --> 17:09.733
I said, "Give this $500 to my son."
I never asked her...

17:09.799 --> 17:11.032
[Judge Judy]
Just a second. Just a second.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.767
- ...did she need anything.
- [Judge Judy] Just a second.

17:12.834 --> 17:15.633
What I'm telling you was,
this was not your money.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.900
- Oh, yes, it was my money.
- [Judge Judy] No. No.

17:17.967 --> 17:20.666
Yes, ma'am. I pay...I pay his bills.

17:20.733 --> 17:22.799
- Yes, ma'am. This is my money.
- Okay. Okay.

17:22.866 --> 17:25.333
Ms. Blake, and I'm telling you

17:25.400 --> 17:29.467
that when you are, legally,
when you're 20 years old,

17:29.532 --> 17:32.133
and you're living
outside of the household,

17:32.200 --> 17:33.799
which is your household,

17:33.866 --> 17:36.666
the fact that you may have
claimed him as a dependent

17:36.733 --> 17:39.967
and the government therefore
put the $1,400

17:40.032 --> 17:43.432
that was earmarked for him
in your bank account,

17:43.500 --> 17:46.099
he is an emancipated person.

17:46.165 --> 17:49.967
And if you want to continue to spoil him
by making his car payment

17:50.032 --> 17:53.799
and his insurance payments,
and buying him clothes,

17:53.866 --> 17:58.000
because he's still coming to find himself,

17:58.066 --> 18:00.567
you can do that...
you could do that till he's 50.

18:00.633 --> 18:04.567
But that doesn't mean he's not
an emancipated person under the law.

18:04.633 --> 18:05.700
That's his money.

18:05.767 --> 18:10.232
And so you are actually
the wrong person standing in that place.

18:10.299 --> 18:14.700
And, Antonio, I think
probably knows and would not...

18:14.767 --> 18:16.733
I don't know
about the bedroom furniture.

18:16.799 --> 18:19.165
She's certainly not gonna pay
for bedroom furniture

18:19.232 --> 18:20.767
that was given as a gift.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.700
You have a bedroom set now, Antonio?

18:22.767 --> 18:24.099
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Judge Judy] Right.

18:24.165 --> 18:26.767
And what would you do
with another bedroom set?

18:26.834 --> 18:29.099
- Leave it where it's at and get my own.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

18:29.165 --> 18:32.232
You should know...I don't know
whether these stimulus checks

18:32.299 --> 18:33.467
are going to continue.

18:33.532 --> 18:37.032
They keep the printing presses
running pretty swiftly.

18:37.099 --> 18:39.700
They're in...wherever
they print money in this country,

18:39.767 --> 18:42.432
they probably have to build
more printing presses

18:42.500 --> 18:45.532
because they seem to be
spending a whole lot of money.

18:45.599 --> 18:47.032
In any event, Ms. Blake,

18:47.099 --> 18:49.366
you're not entitled to any money
for the bedroom set.

18:49.432 --> 18:54.165
And the $500 was spent on bills
that were accumulated for your son

18:54.232 --> 18:58.432
while he was living with the defendant
with the exception of your car payment.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.467
And even though
she may be the wrong party,

19:01.532 --> 19:03.532
I want to know
how much your car payment is.

19:03.599 --> 19:06.133
I, I didn't make a car payment.
I paid my insurance for my car.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.733
What was your insurance payment
that you made?

19:07.799 --> 19:09.967
[Shanovya] Oh, at the time...

19:10.032 --> 19:13.066
- it was 187.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

19:13.133 --> 19:16.933
Antonio, and this is a question for you,
not your mother.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.633
You have a problem
with her paying $187

19:20.700 --> 19:23.266
on her car insurance out of that $500?

19:23.333 --> 19:24.666
Car insurance. Yes.

19:24.733 --> 19:25.700
[Judge Judy]
You have a problem with that?

19:25.767 --> 19:26.633
Yes, ma'am.

19:26.700 --> 19:30.133
Then I think you should sue her
for the $187.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.165
That's all you would get in front of me,
but your mother's the wrong party.

19:33.232 --> 19:35.700
Now, you have a counterclaim
that's ridiculous.

19:35.767 --> 19:38.165
You have a counterclaim
for emotional distress.

19:38.232 --> 19:42.200
This is your claim
that Ms. Blake harasses you.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.866
She's not gonna harass you anymore.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.266
She's annoyed
that you have a bedroom set

19:46.333 --> 19:48.834
that she paid for a dozen years ago.

19:48.900 --> 19:50.834
She has to get over it
because it was a gift,

19:50.900 --> 19:52.299
she has no interest in it.

19:52.366 --> 19:53.299
I don't know where it is.

19:53.366 --> 19:54.200
Where's the bedroom set?

19:54.266 --> 19:56.532
The nightstand and the dresser
is still at my home.

19:56.599 --> 19:58.834
The bed, I moved out
the beginning of this month.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.400
Now, let's see
if I can clean this up a little bit.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.400
Do you want your nightstand back?

20:04.467 --> 20:06.165
Two nightstands and a dresser.

20:08.232 --> 20:11.700
Did you have nightstands and a dresser
before he moved in?

20:11.767 --> 20:13.834
Um, I had places to put my clothes.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.666
I didn't need any of the furniture at all.

20:15.733 --> 20:18.232
Well, no, what I'm asking you
is, did you dispose

20:18.299 --> 20:21.767
of nightstands and a dresser
when he moved in?

20:21.834 --> 20:23.700
- No, ma'am.
- You want them back?

20:23.767 --> 20:25.400
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Judge Judy] Okay.

20:25.467 --> 20:27.599
- Those are his...what?
- If I may.

20:27.666 --> 20:30.266
Um, he's been to my home
on two separate occasions.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.400
I've given him multiple opportunities
just to get this stuff.

20:32.467 --> 20:35.299
I actually texted him in July
and asked him to come and get them,

20:35.366 --> 20:36.767
he told me he could not

20:36.834 --> 20:38.866
and that he had no one
and that his mother,

20:38.933 --> 20:40.900
he would ask her but he didn't know.

20:40.967 --> 20:43.000
And then I text her as well,
and she did not answer.

20:43.066 --> 20:45.866
[Judge Judy] Okay. I'm gonna make
this very, very easy then.

20:45.933 --> 20:48.299
You have two nightstands and a dresser.

20:48.366 --> 20:52.099
If Antonio makes arrangements
to pick them up

20:52.165 --> 20:54.834
on notice to you within 48 hours,

20:54.900 --> 20:56.700
within the next five days,

20:56.767 --> 20:59.165
you have no problem giving them to him?

20:59.232 --> 21:01.099
Great. We'll prepare that order.

21:01.165 --> 21:05.799
If you don't remove them within five days
on 48-hours' notice to her,

21:05.866 --> 21:07.700
they belong to her.
Do you understand, Antonio?

21:07.767 --> 21:08.799
- Yes, I'm able to now.
- [Judge Judy] Great.

21:08.866 --> 21:10.165
Thank you very much. We're done.

21:10.232 --> 21:11.232
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

21:14.633 --> 21:15.799
I guess it was fair.

21:15.866 --> 21:17.165
I feel like everything was fair.

21:17.232 --> 21:18.532
I'm glad it's over with.

21:18.599 --> 21:20.799
I don't never have to see
that young lady ever again.

21:20.866 --> 21:23.200
This young man
has completely ruined my life literally.

21:23.266 --> 21:24.165
Stay to yourself.

21:24.232 --> 21:25.333
So now, I have to rebuild

21:25.400 --> 21:27.432
and become the successful young lady

21:27.500 --> 21:28.933
I know I will be.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.400
[Sarah]
There seems to be a lot of confusion

21:30.467 --> 21:31.834
about these stimulus checks

21:31.900 --> 21:35.165
and who they're supposed to go to,
who's supposed to spend them.

21:35.232 --> 21:37.266
There's no real clear guidelines,
I feel like.

21:37.333 --> 21:40.333
Well, we've had...
I think three or four cases so far

21:40.400 --> 21:42.066
that dealt with those stimulus checks.

21:42.133 --> 21:45.400
In this case it was clear,
she wasn't supporting him,

21:45.467 --> 21:48.967
yeah, she was spoiling him
with a car and gas money and...

21:49.032 --> 21:50.567
- The extras.
- [Judge Judy] The extras.

21:50.633 --> 21:53.266
But he was living and being
supported by somebody else.

21:53.333 --> 21:54.700
So it was clearly his money.

21:54.767 --> 21:56.266
He didn't claim himself as a dependent.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.333
He was still growing up.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.933
He's a very sweet young man,
by the way.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.532
- Yeah.
- [Judge Judy] But what did I tell you

22:00.599 --> 22:03.432
about gifts and once you give a gift?

22:03.500 --> 22:04.799
No givesies backsies.

22:04.866 --> 22:06.200
Right. That's true.

22:06.266 --> 22:08.666
Once you give a gift, you give a gift

22:08.733 --> 22:12.666
and you no longer have
any personal interest in that gift.

22:12.733 --> 22:14.000
So easy case.

22:14.066 --> 22:14.933
Good lessons.
