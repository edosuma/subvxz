00:00.959 --> 00:02.044
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.169 --> 00:03.586
All right,enough,enough.

00:03.670 --> 00:04.838
Congratulations,lou.

00:04.963 --> 00:06.840
Second time around is the charm.

00:06.924 --> 00:08.550
- Third time,actually.
- Shut up.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.844
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa!

00:11.303 --> 00:12.846
No,no,no,no-ohh!

00:13.555 --> 00:15.098
Oh,easy,easy,easy!

00:15.182 --> 00:17.184
Get her the hell out of there!

00:18.936 --> 00:20.437
Thanks,fellas. I'm all set.

00:20.896 --> 00:23.398
Ask your mom to pad
your curfew a few hours.

00:23.482 --> 00:25.651
Tomorrow night,10:00.

00:26.068 --> 00:26.944
Where's the kid?

00:27.069 --> 00:28.320
I came down here...

00:28.362 --> 00:31.949
to just try and make sure that
you kept your paws off my godson.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.742
I came here to broaden his horizons.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.161
You came down her to get him
shit-faced and bang his brains out.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.913
You know,you've got A...

00:38.038 --> 00:40.123
like a triangle in your left eye.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.208
Yes.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.668
It's kind of like bowie.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.839
We got some very smokin' ladies here,and I'd
say 70% of them are friends and colleagues.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.424
We got bull dykes.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.051
Jesus christ,I'm bangin' a gay chick.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.303
She loves red sox,I'm the yankees.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.180
I have a hell of a lot more to offer.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.098
And how do you figure that?

00:56.139 --> 00:57.641
Because I come with your children.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.268
I married jimmy...

00:59.685 --> 01:01.436
because he wasn't like me.

01:01.562 --> 01:05.774
And,you know,he was really sweet up
until the time when he cheated on me.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.193
He had an affair and I found out.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.486
Who'd you sleep with?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.029
Don't you worry about it.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.491
Someone I knew?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.416
Tommy,come in.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.836
Tommy,do you copy?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.214
Tommy,what is your location?come in!

01:29.339 --> 01:30.799
Aisle 8,lou.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.926
Don't forget the avocados,goddamn it.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.470
Well,you stuck me with
bush and rumsfeld over here.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.891
Look,the real housewives of new
york city marathon starts at 8:00.

01:38.974 --> 01:42.102
That gives me an hour to
pull mexican night together.

01:42.186 --> 01:46.273
And while I'm king shit when it comes to
food prep,I'm not a goddamn miracle worker!

01:46.356 --> 01:47.941
Copy that?Are we clear?

01:48.066 --> 01:49.693
Yeah,I got that,rachael ray.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.196
So,tom,you gonna come and check out
the band's audition this weekend?

01:52.279 --> 01:53.322
Kelly gonna be there?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.199
Uh,I don't know. Why don't
you ask her?You're dating her.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.743
I'm not dating her. I'm trying
to keep her away from damian.

01:57.826 --> 01:58.911
Yeah,good job,by the way.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.621
She called me again last night.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.915
Psych.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.167
- Just kidding,dude.
- You're so funny.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.127
Aw,jesus.

02:07.211 --> 02:08.669
Ma'am.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.255
Uh,lady?

02:10.297 --> 02:11.882
I think her hearing aid's dead.

02:11.917 --> 02:12.716
unbelievable.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.510
Tommy,you gonna come to the audition?

02:14.718 --> 02:17.971
Listen,mike,you know I like
you,ok,and I like the band.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.306
I just-I'm
getting...

02:19.389 --> 02:21.266
worried that maybe you're
getting your hopes up too high.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.643
You know what I mean?

02:22.768 --> 02:24.770
Yeah,man. I don't think I'm
really getting my hopes up,though.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.563
You know,I just want to
like record an album maybe,

02:26.688 --> 02:29.858
like do a small club tour to some
major cities or something,you know?

02:29.942 --> 02:31.109
All right.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.111
You know,and maybe hit the grammys.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.864
To watch.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.199
Or to win.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.785
You know,this really sucks.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.495
We're buying food I
don't even get to eat.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.123
I want you stepping into that
ring lean and hungry,pal,all right?

02:45.249 --> 02:46.750
This broad your fighting's
no walk in the park.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.794
Capers. We need capers.

02:48.877 --> 02:50.921
Look,frank,this chick
is a pro,all right?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.256
She's a real boxer.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.882
Now,I'm not saying you can't beat her.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.134
I mean,we wouldn't lay the nut we did
on you if we didn't think you could win,

02:56.176 --> 02:59.012
but I got it set so the
odds are in her favor.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.931
When you step in there,I want
you to be ready,you understand?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.266
- All right.
- Good.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.352
No,I said capers,not corn chips. Capers.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.271
Leave 'em,just leave 'em.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.355
You know,I gotta be
honest with you guys.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.732
I'm really having second
thoughts about this whole fight.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.317
I mean,a guy fighting a dame?

03:12.401 --> 03:16.572
I mean,unless my parents have come back from
beyond the grave,I don't think it's natural.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.575
You have no idea what a caper is,do you?

03:19.658 --> 03:21.159
Just-just
leave 'em and go.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.120
- Don't listen to him,frank,all right?
- Yeah.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.873
Look,I'm sorry,lou,but
as a dewy-eyed newlywed,

03:25.956 --> 03:27.583
I think you lack the
ability to be objective here.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.042
Salt.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.211
Listen,I might be a
little dewy-eyed right now.

03:31.295 --> 03:34.673
That's only because,uh,candy and I
are planning our second honeymoon.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.466
You just got back from mohegan sun.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.385
Yeah,but now she wants
a proper honeymoon.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.761
She wants 2 weeks on the beach.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.346
I'm thinking turks and caicos.

03:41.513 --> 03:42.723
Ah,sweet!

03:42.806 --> 03:43.599
Sweet?

03:43.682 --> 03:44.975
You never seen lou in a bathing suit.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.019
Bathing suit?Who wears a bathing suit?

03:47.144 --> 03:48.562
Call turks and caicos.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.355
Tell people to start
stabbing their eyes out.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.440
Immediately.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.568
I'll tell you what makes it even
sweeter-besides a nude lou-

03:54.693 --> 03:57.738
is the fact that I get to plan the
whole trip and she gets to pay for it.

03:57.779 --> 03:58.572
So you know what?

03:58.739 --> 04:02.367
Right now I'm not really feeling all that
anger and resentment towards the fairer sex.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.619
Give it time,pal.

04:03.660 --> 04:04.620
Give it time.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.246
So what's up with the
second honeymoon thing?

04:06.580 --> 04:09.666
I mean,colleen this morning said that
her mom was thinking about doing a...

04:09.750 --> 04:12.753
second honeymoon weekend in
the berkshires with tommy.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.422
Tommy and janet for a
weekend in the mountains?

04:17.466 --> 04:19.218
How do you warn mountains?

04:19.718 --> 04:21.011
You yodel.

04:21.678 --> 04:22.763
Girls.

04:24.306 --> 04:25.724
I know what those are.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.434
She still looking?

04:28.727 --> 04:30.103
Yeah.

04:30.312 --> 04:31.396
Keep your eyes on the shelf.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.940
She'll come to us.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.442
- We gotta finish shopping.
- We are shopping,ok?

04:35.567 --> 04:37.277
We're pussy shopping. All right?

04:37.402 --> 04:40.322
Firemen in the supermarket- that's
like lebron james in the open court.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.990
It's a slam goddamn dunk.

04:42.074 --> 04:47.204
Chicks see us,working class guys all geared
up like this-heroes-carrying a shopping list?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.540
They begin to believe
that we're house-trained.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.919
She's gone.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.671
All right,she'll be back.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.798
Mike,get in the cart.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.633
Do not get in the goddamn cart.

04:59.758 --> 05:01.009
Tommy,what's your 20?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.386
Aisle 4,lou.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.346
Oh,I thought you'd be in produce by now.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.305
Yeah,we got hung up.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.723
Yeah,pussy shopping.

05:06.765 --> 05:07.766
No.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.644
Yes.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.980
Hey,listen,what's the
deal I hear about,uh,

05:13.105 --> 05:15.899
you and janet going up to the
berkshires for the weekend?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.277
Who told you about that?

05:18.360 --> 05:20.070
Don't get in that goddamn cart.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.197
Well,you know I never
divulge my sources.

05:22.281 --> 05:23.156
Black shawn.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.325
Of course it was black shawn.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.493
What's the deal?

05:26.577 --> 05:28.912
What,is she trying
to sway favor her way?

05:28.996 --> 05:31.415
You know,if you guys want to play
patty cake with somebody's... you know...

05:31.498 --> 05:34.042
private life on the telephone,pick
somebody else's life,all right?

05:34.126 --> 05:36.044
Just get me my goddamn avocados.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.673
Don't say a word about
this to your mother,ok?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.717
- About what?
- About the goddamn berkshires.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.760
- When you going there?I hear it's pret...
- Shut up.

05:43.886 --> 05:47.639
And don't tell her about the kelly thing
either,because that was a godfather type of covering-

05:47.723 --> 05:49.725
Yeah,yeah,whatever. Like i give a shit.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.185
I'm getting the avocados.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.561
All right.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.354
Hey,I can't get out.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.190
Yeah,join the goddamn club.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:07.117 --> 06:08.577
Shit.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.454
Lou,we got a problem.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.496
Go.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.916
I just saw some guy shoplift
a couple of avocados.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.250
I think he's got a steak,too.

06:15.334 --> 06:15.959
Well,you know what?

06:16.001 --> 06:18.462
If the shoplifter is not on
fire,then I really could give a shit.

06:18.497 --> 06:19.338
You understand?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.048
They were the last 2 avocados.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.716
- So grab him!
- I'm not a cop.

06:22.799 --> 06:26.345
Well,you're a goddamn civil servant,you
little shit,so do your civic duty...

06:26.428 --> 06:28.680
and go get me my avocados!

06:33.227 --> 06:34.061
Hey!

06:34.102 --> 06:35.103
Drop the produce.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.694
He's mobile,lou!

06:42.778 --> 06:44.363
Guys!Guys!

06:44.446 --> 06:45.781
Mexican night is in peril.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.990
Scramble!

06:47.032 --> 06:48.408
Tommy,bar the door!

06:48.492 --> 06:49.284
Got it.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.786
Whoa,tommy!

06:53.956 --> 06:54.540
Hey!

06:58.502 --> 06:59.253

07:06.176 --> 07:07.511

Anybody got eyes on this guy?

07:33.078 --> 07:35.789
Yeah,thought you'D****Pal.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.709
- What the hell-
- Don't you move.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.960
It's all right. We got him.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.420
What are you talkin'
about?Look what youse did.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.629
The guy's a shoplifter,all right?

07:42.671 --> 07:43.630
We got it under control.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.132
Look,check his coat,tom.

07:45.174 --> 07:47.176
- Yeah,look at that.
- Oh,shit.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.305
And we're halfway to
lou's holy guacamole.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.181
Well-

07:52.848 --> 07:55.017
The last avocado!Fantastic!

07:55.100 --> 07:57.102
- Oh,god.
- Thank you.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.024

08:02.774 --> 08:05.986
You assholes trashed my store
over a steak and 2 avocados?

08:06.028 --> 08:07.654
Get outta here before I call the cops.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.323
Oh,yeah,call the
cops. Yeah,that's a smart move.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.908
Where the hell were the cops
when you were getting ripped off?

08:10.949 --> 08:12.618
They were nowhere.

08:12.743 --> 08:13.834
You know who was here?We were here.

08:13.869 --> 08:17.831
The fdny was
here-ready,capable,and professional.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.500
Hey,guys?

08:20.501 --> 08:22.794
Could I get a hand,please?

08:22.878 --> 08:24.588
He's not with us.

08:30.969 --> 08:31.512
Yeah?

08:31.595 --> 08:34.222
Hey,I need you to come over
here and hang my television.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.640
Ok,I-I'm-I'm
at work.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.351
I'm very busy,ok?

08:37.392 --> 08:39.186
Yeah. Come after your shift.

08:39.227 --> 08:43.447
And by that,I mean
immediately after your shift.

08:43.482 --> 08:47.778
Listen- you called your mother
about the berkshires thing,didn't you?

08:47.945 --> 08:48.612
I didn't call her.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.906
You called your mother
about the berk-admit it.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.324
I didn't,I swear.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.825
Ok,I know you called her,all right?

08:53.909 --> 08:55.160
I did not call her.

08:55.195 --> 08:56.453
Whatever.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.082
I texted her.

09:51.133 --> 09:56.180
Yeah,so anyways,like an idiot she tells
colleen,and like a moron,colleen tells shawn.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.870
Asswipe that shawn is,he tells
all the guys,and of course,damian,

09:59.905 --> 10:03.478
being the mama's boy that he
is,waited,what,15 seconds before he

10:03.520 --> 10:04.938
called you with the information.

10:05.022 --> 10:08.150
Yeah,I think that janet knew
exactly what she was doing.

10:08.483 --> 10:11.403
A weekend away up in the
mountains,just the two of you.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.447
There's nothing to
do but screw and hike,

10:13.530 --> 10:16.366
and I will bet you my left tit that
she doesn't have any hiking boots.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.743
She hasn't even asked me yet. All right?

10:17.826 --> 10:18.869
So...

10:18.952 --> 10:23.248
we might as well be visiting moot point up
there in the mountains,because,you know...

10:23.457 --> 10:24.791
All right?

10:25.209 --> 10:28.378
Well,are you gonna go to moot point?

10:30.339 --> 10:33.717
You realize the size of
this thing,ok,in high def?

10:33.800 --> 10:37.888
You know,brad pitt's-those little acne
hole things that he has on his face?

10:37.971 --> 10:39.723
They're gonna look like goddamn craters,

10:39.806 --> 10:42.643
like the kind of craters they
have on the moon,on this thing.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.355
Well,I guess I'll just be
taking a little moon walk,then.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.485
hey,let me ask you something.

10:51.527 --> 10:52.611
Yeah?

10:52.653 --> 10:54.696
About jimmy,you know,uh...

10:55.322 --> 10:58.200
- did you ever find out,you
know- - Who he slept with?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.076
Yeah.

10:59.201 --> 11:01.078
It's not important anymore.

11:04.289 --> 11:09.169
So I'm assuming,ahem,you,uh,you
know,you have... proof?

11:09.253 --> 11:10.671
What,that he slept with her?Yeah.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.172
I mean,he'd been seeing her for months.

11:12.207 --> 11:13.465
I have the evidence.

11:13.549 --> 11:15.759
I have cell phone records and,

11:15.801 --> 11:19.513
um,strange perfume smells,and lipstick.

11:19.555 --> 11:21.014
The whole nine yards.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.058
Plus,I caught them together.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.060
What do you mean,in bed?

11:25.102 --> 11:26.770
No,worse.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.314
There's something worse?

11:29.398 --> 11:30.232
Yes.

11:30.274 --> 11:37.072
A nice quiet candlelight dinner in
my favorite spot in little italy.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.282
Stannatto's?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.575
Oh,boy.

11:39.658 --> 11:48.125
And,you know,I walked in and they were
holding hands and they were kissing...

11:50.002 --> 11:54.173
Over luscious plates
of angel hair pasta.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.924
Oh,what an idiot.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.759
With the white sauce.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.138
Which you know is my favorite.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.308
Take off your tool belt.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.895
But I-I'm
supposed to,uh-

12:07.978 --> 12:08.979
No,take off your tool belt,

12:09.062 --> 12:10.898
but leave it close by in
case i want to play with it.

12:10.981 --> 12:12.774
And take off your shirt and lay down.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.985
I'm not asking you,I'm telling you,ok?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.946
Because this may be the
last time that we have sex,

12:18.030 --> 12:20.407
and I think that we
should make it a doozy!

12:21.909 --> 12:23.702
All right.

12:41.803 --> 12:44.556
- What,uh-
- Shh!

12:54.066 --> 12:55.192
You ok?

12:55.317 --> 12:56.735
Yeah.

12:56.985 --> 12:58.570
Go on,finish yours.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.407
Yeah.

13:03.992 --> 13:05.577
Now lay down.

13:05.869 --> 13:06.954
Ok.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.709
All right.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.423
Hey.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.050
Where'd you get those?

13:20.092 --> 13:22.219
I had them left over.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.430
Is that for me
or for- oh,ok.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.228
They come as the,uh,one package there?

13:31.270 --> 13:33.397
Yeah,you gotta stretch 'em out,but,yeah.

13:36.859 --> 13:37.776
That feel good?

13:37.860 --> 13:38.777
Yeah.

13:42.573 --> 13:43.907
- You comfy?
- Yeah.

13:44.032 --> 13:44.908
Ok.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.285
What are you gonna do?

13:46.368 --> 13:47.369
Lots of things.

13:47.411 --> 13:47.911
Really?

13:51.957 --> 13:53.959
Do you want to know
some more about jimmy?

13:54.001 --> 13:55.127
No.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.170
You were asking.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.296
Yeah,but not right now.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.549
Oh!

14:02.885 --> 14:04.553
I'll tell you something.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.597
I knew...

14:06.680 --> 14:08.223
because...

14:08.682 --> 14:10.475
it was in his walk...

14:12.227 --> 14:14.396
it was in his hands...

14:15.355 --> 14:17.566
it was in the way that he touched me.

14:17.649 --> 14:21.278
This little invisible tremor...

14:22.029 --> 14:25.032
That snuck down...

14:26.325 --> 14:28.118
his fingertips.

14:28.160 --> 14:30.579
And I knew...

14:34.583 --> 14:35.834
Hey.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.794
- She gave this to him.
- Yeah?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.213
- I found it.
- Right.

14:39.296 --> 14:40.547
And I stole it.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.383
Little empire state building.

14:43.467 --> 14:44.760
So cute.

14:46.136 --> 14:50.432
I don't know,I guess that she
loved that tom hanks-meg ryan movie

14:50.516 --> 14:52.559
- where they meet up on-
- Sleepless in seattle?

14:52.643 --> 14:53.393
What?

14:53.519 --> 14:56.146
You don't know hamlet but you know this?

14:57.147 --> 14:58.649
Janet made me see it like 4 times.

14:59.274 --> 15:02.319
- What-
- Don't you talk about janet here now.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.155
I'm sorry. Is that hard?

15:05.190 --> 15:06.657
Did I hit you hard?

15:06.740 --> 15:07.407
It was fine.

15:07.491 --> 15:09.243
I'm sorry.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.411
Did I hurt you?

15:11.537 --> 15:12.538
No.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.629
When jimmy died...

15:21.505 --> 15:22.673
Um,yeah...

15:23.757 --> 15:28.512
The only person who I felt knew...

15:30.514 --> 15:32.683
- How I felt...
- Yeah.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.143
Who understood how I felt...

15:36.395 --> 15:37.813
Was you.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.485
And when our...

15:43.569 --> 15:48.991
passion started to pop,that
is when it dawned on me...

15:49.026 --> 15:50.284
Yeah?

15:55.581 --> 15:57.131
Hey,hey,hey...

15:57.166 --> 15:59.501
This is what you're all about.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.129
Ok.

16:02.421 --> 16:04.256
Uh,what are you doing?

16:04.381 --> 16:06.091
- This...
- Sheil...

16:06.216 --> 16:08.302
- Is what makes you move.
- Hey.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.096
- It's what makes you breathe.
- Hey.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.473
- And behave.
- Hey,cut the shit.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.184
Your marriage...

16:17.477 --> 16:21.231
Was only worth something to
you when it was falling apart.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.442
- Right?
- Stop it.

16:23.525 --> 16:26.403
When it was working...

16:27.487 --> 16:29.239
- you didn't feel anything.
- Stop it.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.826
- Not a dash of anything.
- Stop it.

16:32.910 --> 16:34.244
Right?

16:34.620 --> 16:36.830
Because normalcy...

16:37.956 --> 16:39.458
bores you.

16:40.042 --> 16:44.880
And I don't even care about
this other new chick. Ok?

16:44.963 --> 16:48.592
She's not important to me in the least.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.511
Because you know what?

16:52.679 --> 16:56.725
- Do you really think
that... - Sheila-

16:56.767 --> 16:58.060
She...

16:58.477 --> 17:03.524
- or janet or any
other- - Hey,hey.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.068
Hot,devoted...

17:07.861 --> 17:10.696
- Animal on this earth-
- Cut this shit!

17:10.739 --> 17:12.824
Would make you twist like this?

17:14.284 --> 17:15.536
Huh?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.246
And then...

17:20.040 --> 17:21.375
Oh...

17:22.501 --> 17:25.921
have you hard as a rock...

17:27.506 --> 17:29.299
the next second?

17:31.969 --> 17:34.179
Yeah,I don't think so.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.517
Listen...

17:40.477 --> 17:42.437
do you want to...

17:43.856 --> 17:46.900
wake up to some sort of challenge,

17:47.317 --> 17:54.908
some sort of shock,a sweet electrical
charge every single day of your life?

17:55.868 --> 18:00.038
Even after you stop firefighting?

18:01.832 --> 18:04.626
Then I'm your best bet.

18:39.036 --> 18:41.830
That plasma ain't gonna hang itself.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.127
Jesus christ.

18:51.215 --> 18:52.966
Shit.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.261
Hey.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.347
It wasn't janet,by the way.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.766
In case you were wondering.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.644
Yeah,just thought I'd tell you.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.772
What,did you think I
was a scumbag like you?

19:07.940 --> 19:10.776
Now,listen,regardless
of whatever I did or

19:10.901 --> 19:13.028
whatever reasons I might have had,

19:13.278 --> 19:16.448
I never would have slept with
janet if the tide was reversed,

19:16.532 --> 19:17.282
you know what I mean?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.910
Like if you died in the world
trade center instead of me,

19:20.911 --> 19:23.914
sheila and me,we might have been
said and done with-who knows?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.500
But no way I would have
slept with your old lady.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.085
That's just me.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.170
Ok?

19:30.254 --> 19:31.880
Code of honor,cuz.

19:31.922 --> 19:33.215
The brotherhood,right?

19:33.298 --> 19:34.007
Yeah.

19:34.091 --> 19:37.177
By the way,you ought to take
the deal sheila's offering.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.054
Take it and run with it.

19:39.137 --> 19:42.015
'Cause the two of you are gonna end
up killing each other either way.

19:42.850 --> 19:46.895
Might as well go out with that
great big goddamn blaze of glory.

19:47.604 --> 19:48.480
Hey!

19:48.522 --> 19:49.523
Jimmy!

19:49.606 --> 19:50.815
Hey!

19:50.850 --> 19:52.025
Yeah?

19:52.150 --> 19:53.819
Nothin'.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.545
20 bucks.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.255
All right,you all set?

20:13.338 --> 20:14.131
Yep.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.425
Teddy's granddad bottle's
filled with johnny blue.

20:16.717 --> 20:20.012
Mickey's old wolfschmidt bottle
is filled with grey goose.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.639
These ginger ale bottles
here-filled with ellie's cristal.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.392
These guys are not even drinking
what the customers are drinking.

20:25.684 --> 20:27.811
Well,have you tasted what
the customers are drinking?

20:27.895 --> 20:29.062
Good point.

20:29.146 --> 20:31.190
Hey,I,uh,i spilled some of
that wild turkey on my jeans.

20:31.273 --> 20:32.941
Burned a hole right through.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.110
Got a bad case of the old thigh hives.

20:35.194 --> 20:36.236
Thigh hives?

20:36.320 --> 20:37.571
Yeah,you don't want to know.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.907
What it is,is this horrible rash
that happens on your inner thigh.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.492
It's like really pimply.

20:42.159 --> 20:43.619
You squeeze it,nothing happens.

20:43.654 --> 20:45.746
No pus,no...

20:46.163 --> 20:47.039
no pain,nothing.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.166
It's really weird. It's very...

20:50.167 --> 20:52.085
oh,you didn't-you didn't want to know.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.340
Yeah,I'm gonna check

21:00.135 --> 21:02.429
Guys,I'm having pangs.

21:02.679 --> 21:03.972
What do you mean? You hungry?

21:04.431 --> 21:06.266
- Guilt pangs.
- About what?

21:06.350 --> 21:07.392
From this.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.269
This.

21:09.353 --> 21:11.396
Paying teddy,ellie,and mickey

21:11.480 --> 21:15.150
all confirmed self-confessed
alcoholics paying them to drink.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.610
Here.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.196
With these kids.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.114
These asshole hipsters.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.535
I'm an alcoholic,too,and I think it's sick.

21:24.576 --> 21:25.953
I really,really do.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.498
So you're bucking for a little pay raise?

21:30.541 --> 21:31.917
It's not about the money.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.836
I'll give you an extra 50 cents an hour.

21:33.919 --> 21:35.379
It's the principle.

21:35.546 --> 21:37.756
One dollar extra an hour.

21:38.757 --> 21:42.094
It goes against the entire
premise of my program.

21:42.177 --> 21:44.972
- A buck fifty. Highest I'm going.
- Done.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.057
Nice work.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.559
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

21:48.600 --> 21:50.769
Are those pickled eggs in that jar?

21:50.804 --> 21:51.770
Why,yes,they are.

21:51.895 --> 21:52.813
Cool.

21:52.938 --> 21:54.189
How do they taste?

21:54.356 --> 21:55.398
Like...

21:55.433 --> 21:56.441
both: Shit.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.068
- That is so dope.
- Yeah.

21:58.402 --> 22:00.112
- Could we get... 2?
- Yeah.

22:00.362 --> 22:01.655
You got it. 5 bucks.

22:01.989 --> 22:03.740
Yeah.

22:05.325 --> 22:08.120
Well,look what the cat dragged in.

22:08.162 --> 22:09.621
So it's all true.

22:10.205 --> 22:13.375
You have reached your lowest ebb ever,tommy.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.793
Thank you.

22:15.878 --> 22:16.920
Did you call her?

22:17.296 --> 22:18.338
No,I called him.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.007
She promised that we would
never have to have sex again.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.842
We're never having sex again,right?

22:21.884 --> 22:27.556
Not if your cancer-ridden microscopic
little penis was the last one on earth.

22:27.806 --> 22:29.099
Well,thank god.

22:29.183 --> 22:30.934
I'm gonna go get your eggs.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.353
You know,his...

22:33.812 --> 22:35.689
his penis is orange now.

22:35.939 --> 22:37.941
Let me guess-jergens self-tanner.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.026
How'd you hear about that?

22:39.067 --> 22:41.403
Well,it's not the first time it's happened.

22:41.653 --> 22:44.239
I mean,at least it's not the icy hot.

22:44.323 --> 22:45.199
Oh,my god.

22:45.282 --> 22:49.495
So you don't mind using our alcoholic
family as a shill for your bar business?

22:49.661 --> 22:50.871
Let me tell you something,ok?

22:50.954 --> 22:52.539
This place is a license to print money.

22:52.664 --> 22:58.212
These hipster kids-you slap a piece of
ham and some cheese on 2 slices of rye

22:58.504 --> 23:01.798
they call it an old school
sandwich-we charge 12 bucks. Ok?

23:02.049 --> 23:03.675
It's a goddamn gold mine.

23:04.259 --> 23:07.763
But,I mean,you don't have any
moral qualms about this? I mean...

23:07.798 --> 23:08.931
Let me think.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.224
No. Not a one.

23:10.349 --> 23:11.808
Hey,back off,sister.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.101
What is this?

23:13.936 --> 23:15.479
Don't talk to me,ellie.

23:15.562 --> 23:18.398
I mean,you guys are in need of
some medical attention,all of you.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.067
I'm not kidding. Look at you.

23:20.108 --> 23:26.990
Listen,what we need is for assholes
such as yourself to not judge us.

23:27.074 --> 23:30.035
Tommy's not forcing anybody to drink here.

23:30.494 --> 23:39.670
Every cocktail that is poured down each of our thirsty
little throats is poured by the person in charge.

23:39.753 --> 23:42.339
In my case,it's me.

23:42.381 --> 23:43.257
Thanks,ellie.

23:43.382 --> 23:44.842
You're welcome,tommy.

23:44.925 --> 23:47.261
Listen,pour me another
jameson's,would you,please?

23:47.296 --> 23:49.096
- Canadian club.
- Canadian club. Whatever.

23:52.724 --> 23:53.892
Tommy,are they fighting?

23:54.101 --> 23:56.103
Yeah... right on schedule.

23:58.230 --> 24:02.317
Stick around another 5 or 10 minutes,you
might even get to see ellie flash her tits.

24:02.401 --> 24:04.152
Man: Look at the size of those nipples!

24:04.278 --> 24:06.905
- she's early tonight.
- gross.

24:07.406 --> 24:08.782
Bye!

24:11.160 --> 24:13.203
Hey,what do you think about puerto rico?

24:14.413 --> 24:15.581
Yeah,I know.

24:15.664 --> 24:17.207
Too many puerto ricans.

24:19.001 --> 24:22.045
What about 2 weeks in hawaii?

24:22.171 --> 24:25.591
There's beautiful
beaches,helicopter tours,volcanoes.

24:25.883 --> 24:27.342
We could learn to surf.

24:27.426 --> 24:28.677
Why don't we just do the caribbean,you know?

24:28.719 --> 24:31.430
I mean,it's not that expensive.
We don't have to go overboard here.

24:31.555 --> 24:32.681
Why not? I've got the money.

24:33.098 --> 24:34.016
I know.

24:34.099 --> 24:35.434
It's our honeymoon.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.352
We're gonna make memories to
last the rest of our lives.

24:37.436 --> 24:39.646
It may as well be something extravagant.

24:42.107 --> 24:42.983
What?

24:43.108 --> 24:44.776
Nothing. There's just something...

24:45.110 --> 24:51.783
very strangely erotic about watching you
stand there folding my tighty whities.

24:52.910 --> 24:54.620
Hey,you know what?

24:54.953 --> 25:00.584
Why don't we sneak back
into the other room and...

25:00.751 --> 25:03.420
let's get a little jump
on that second honeymoon.

25:03.504 --> 25:05.964
- Shall I bring the laundry?
- No.

25:06.006 --> 25:08.425
The less clothes,the better,you know?

25:11.428 --> 25:13.514
I'm taking you in. I'm taking you in,woman.

25:19.311 --> 25:23.106
So... I'm assuming that you wanted to
meet because you've made your decision.

25:23.482 --> 25:24.566
Nope.

25:27.069 --> 25:30.072
Well,it's pretty cut-and-dried
as far as I'm concerned.

25:30.614 --> 25:33.200
You're gonna get to see katy or you don'T.

25:34.326 --> 25:38.038
It's kind of a no-brainer for most fathers,but
then again,you're not most fathers,are you,tommy?

25:38.121 --> 25:39.039
No.

25:40.874 --> 25:42.626
So why the dinner invite?

25:45.337 --> 25:50.092
I just thought it would be nice to
have a little face-to-face time,a little

25:50.133 --> 25:53.554
get-together over some
romantic food where we could...

25:53.971 --> 25:57.975
talk like two mature-did
you sleep with jimmy keefe?

25:59.268 --> 26:00.686
What?

26:00.894 --> 26:03.063
Did you sleep with jimmy keefe?

26:03.105 --> 26:04.857
A pretty straightforward question.

26:05.315 --> 26:07.860
So this is why you invited me to dinner?

26:08.026 --> 26:09.535
I invited you to dinner because

26:09.570 --> 26:12.614
I know that in a public place like
this that you don't like to make a scene

26:12.656 --> 26:15.617
because you're so concerned all the
time about what people think about you.

26:15.701 --> 26:20.164
Unless,of course,you're visiting your daughter's private
school,in which case,I guess you don't give a shit.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.916
Did you sleep...

26:23.000 --> 26:25.210
with jimmy keefe?

26:29.381 --> 26:31.800
I am not going to answer that.

26:41.018 --> 26:42.811
You just did.

26:42.895 --> 26:45.647
No,I said that- Look,sweetheart...

26:48.233 --> 26:50.527
the way your spine straightened
up the first time I asked you.

26:50.569 --> 26:52.905
The little twitch that almost
showed up on your cheek.

26:52.946 --> 26:54.740
The way you just flipped
your hair back-get away.

26:55.073 --> 26:57.409
Get... away.

27:01.038 --> 27:03.290
I know you like the back of my hand.

27:03.373 --> 27:06.251
I know you did it.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.631
So what would be easier for you?

27:11.465 --> 27:15.093
If I slept with jimmy back in the
day before any of us got married

27:15.385 --> 27:18.430
or if I slept with him a
few weeks before he died?

27:19.556 --> 27:21.558
I think I'm gonna have the veal.

27:25.062 --> 27:26.605
You?

27:37.407 --> 27:38.659
Outside.

27:39.201 --> 27:40.744
Now.

28:16.697 --> 28:19.283
- Sir,there's no smoking in-
- There is now.

28:22.703 --> 28:23.871
Get up.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.459
Do you want me to make a scene?

28:29.543 --> 28:30.419
Is that what you want?

28:30.460 --> 28:32.588
Oh-oh,you're already making a scene.

28:32.713 --> 28:34.214
You think this is a scene?

28:34.381 --> 28:35.591
Yeah.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.020
How's that for a goddamn scene?

28:52.691 --> 28:54.151
Outside.

28:55.611 --> 28:57.779
Sir,your cigarette.

28:57.863 --> 28:59.490
You got an ashtray?

29:02.367 --> 29:04.077
Thank you.

29:13.378 --> 29:14.838
Sir,I'm calling the cops.

29:14.963 --> 29:17.216
Yeah,make sure you sit 'em
in the back. They're animals.

29:20.093 --> 29:21.637
Happy now?

29:22.471 --> 29:24.389
You know,you don't have a leg to stand on.

29:25.224 --> 29:27.226
You slept with jimmy's wife.

29:27.392 --> 29:30.020
You know,grief-stricken or
not,you still slept with her. So...

29:30.395 --> 29:31.897
let's just call it even.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.241
It's not even. Ok?

29:43.075 --> 29:48.121
I started sleeping with sheila
after we were separated. Ok?

29:48.956 --> 29:52.084
And maybe I slept with jimmy
after we were separated.

29:52.835 --> 29:54.586
Maybe we weren't even married.

29:54.670 --> 29:56.588
Hey,does it really matter that much?

29:56.630 --> 29:57.673
Yeah.

29:57.714 --> 29:59.299
It matters to me.

30:02.928 --> 30:08.600
I swear to god,I will tear this
goddamn place apart piece by goddamn...

30:08.934 --> 30:10.811
get away.

30:17.568 --> 30:18.777
I want to know when.

30:20.612 --> 30:23.031
I want to know when.

30:24.116 --> 30:28.078
It happened about 6 months
before we got married.

30:29.246 --> 30:31.039
We both were on a mutual break.

30:31.165 --> 30:32.541
You decided it,actually.

30:32.666 --> 30:34.793
Probably because we both knew
that we were gonna get married

30:34.835 --> 30:37.921
and you were pretty much
pissing yourself 24/7 over it.

30:38.380 --> 30:41.133
You know,I went out for drinks
one night with a bunch of people...

30:42.217 --> 30:47.806
and sheila and jimmy were on a mutual break,and
I guess that we both wanted one last fling.

30:47.848 --> 30:51.101
And what could be safer,you
know,than with each other?

30:52.102 --> 30:53.353
It was nothing.

30:54.229 --> 30:55.814
But it wasn't meaningless.

30:56.273 --> 31:00.444
Because it gave us our bearings back and
made us know who we each belonged with.

31:02.070 --> 31:06.575
Now,why do you think that i called you 4
days after the breakup to get back together?

31:10.871 --> 31:11.580
Oh.

31:11.705 --> 31:13.373
And with that...

31:13.582 --> 31:20.214
another evening with mr. And mrs. Gavin comes
to an exciting yet thoroughly predictable end.

31:20.964 --> 31:24.176
Yeah,I wonder if I can get the veal to go.

31:27.763 --> 31:32.351
Now,remember,you want to deal with that
stain soon because it's gonna set that way.

31:32.434 --> 31:33.644
Sooner is better.

31:33.852 --> 31:35.896
Yeah,and don't rub. You gotta blot.

31:36.063 --> 31:39.024
I got a nice bottle of club soda
in the car,take that right out.

31:39.149 --> 31:41.860
Hey. Me,too. We got a couple
when we got the call,so...

31:41.944 --> 31:44.071
Oh,that's so,so sweet. And
thank you. Thank you so much.

31:44.238 --> 31:45.113
But I'm fine.

31:45.197 --> 31:45.989
No worries.

31:46.031 --> 31:49.618
Hey,if you have any more problems
with him,again,just give us a call.

31:50.327 --> 31:51.829
I certainly will.

31:52.371 --> 31:53.831
Thank you,again.

31:53.914 --> 31:55.666
No,thank you.

31:56.500 --> 32:00.671
You know,I think if you'd actually showed 'em your
pussy I could have knifed the waiter and not done time.

32:02.756 --> 32:04.341
Jesus christ.

32:04.550 --> 32:08.804
You know what? Just don't do what you
normally do now in a situation like this. OK?

32:08.929 --> 32:12.099
Which is what,swear off dinner
dates with you for the next 6 months?

32:12.140 --> 32:13.350
Bye,assholes.

32:13.475 --> 32:15.060
No,call sheila.

32:15.394 --> 32:19.940
You get a few drinks in you,you call sheila,you
head to her house,you have a few more drinks,and...

32:20.065 --> 32:22.234
I think we all know what happens from there.

32:22.276 --> 32:23.026
Yeah.

32:23.318 --> 32:26.864
Or,you know,you could do what you normally do,which
is sleep with another male member of the gavin family.

32:26.905 --> 32:29.158
Oh,that's right-there's none left.

32:29.408 --> 32:31.451
I'm not calling sheila,ok,for
your information.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.829
It's not part of my game plan tonight. Ok?

32:34.121 --> 32:37.291
Oh. Was part of your game
plan calling the other chick?

32:37.499 --> 32:40.127
Oh,yeah. Damian told shawn who told colleen.

32:40.169 --> 32:42.254
Ok,that was damian's date.

32:42.337 --> 32:46.383
I was being a good godfather,that's
what I was doing,ok?

32:46.508 --> 32:49.636
Oh,so now you're the
michael corleone of the fdny.

32:49.678 --> 32:52.598
Yes. Yes,I'm-I- I am michael. Yeah.

32:53.432 --> 32:55.184
It's more like fredo.

33:00.022 --> 33:01.190
Yeah.

33:03.192 --> 33:04.902
I'm not fredo!

33:20.751 --> 33:21.627
Hello.

33:21.710 --> 33:22.586
Hey.

33:22.711 --> 33:24.087
- It's,uh,me. - Who?

33:24.122 --> 33:25.339
Fredo-tommy.

33:25.422 --> 33:27.508
Tommy,hey. How are you?

33:27.549 --> 33:28.425
Good. Good.

33:28.509 --> 33:29.635
How you doin'?

33:29.760 --> 33:32.137
Good. And,listen,I'm gonna be here
all night if you want to bring it over.

33:32.679 --> 33:34.640
I'm sorry,bring over what?

33:34.681 --> 33:35.849
Who is this?

33:35.974 --> 33:37.184
It's...

33:37.267 --> 33:38.185
tommy.

33:38.477 --> 33:39.895
Tommy gavin.

33:40.646 --> 33:41.897
The mechanic?

33:42.231 --> 33:43.398
The fireman.

33:44.024 --> 33:44.858
Oh.

33:45.359 --> 33:46.443
Sorry.

33:46.527 --> 33:47.319
Jesus christ.

33:47.653 --> 33:48.987
I know a lot of tommys.

33:49.279 --> 33:50.739
You know a lot of tommy gavins?

33:50.864 --> 33:53.450
I'm not good with last
names. What do you want?

33:53.492 --> 33:58.831
Well,I was just wondering if you-if you wanted
to,you know,maybe go out and grab a drink.

34:00.874 --> 34:01.750
Wow.

34:01.834 --> 34:03.919
- I'm kind of not in the mood.
- Ok.

34:04.002 --> 34:06.004
To go out.

34:06.296 --> 34:08.507
You know. I'm already in.

34:08.542 --> 34:09.091
All right.

34:09.132 --> 34:10.425
Why don't you just come over.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.302
- Really? - Yeah.

34:12.344 --> 34:14.888
We can pick up where we left off last time.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.389
Which was?

34:16.598 --> 34:20.978
I believe when the cab pulled up to my building,you
were attempting to give me a free mammogram.

34:21.061 --> 34:22.437
You remember that?

34:22.855 --> 34:24.273
Maybe.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.449
Frankie,you got a phone call.

34:34.491 --> 34:35.951
It's carla.

34:45.210 --> 34:46.335
Thanks.

34:46.378 --> 34:47.629
What's going on?

34:48.172 --> 34:49.380
Why'd you call me?

34:51.507 --> 34:54.969
I was just thinking of you and...

35:04.271 --> 35:06.690
so,this is the-the,uh,your new place?

35:06.725 --> 35:08.031
Oh,it's temporary.

35:08.066 --> 35:10.110
And this is all,uh,new stuff?

35:10.527 --> 35:11.904
It's not my stuff.

35:13.489 --> 35:16.116
You guys didn't get there
in time to save my stuff.

35:16.283 --> 35:19.453
well,we-you know,it was a big fire. We...

35:19.495 --> 35:21.955
we try to save the people and the...

35:22.456 --> 35:23.582
pets...

35:24.374 --> 35:27.085
and... and then we worry about the stuff.

35:33.300 --> 35:35.219
Is this a bad time?

35:35.302 --> 35:37.012
You feel like you're being judged?

35:37.221 --> 35:38.847
I'm feeling a little...

35:39.973 --> 35:40.849
yeah.

35:40.974 --> 35:42.518
Well,you are.

35:44.811 --> 35:46.104
You know...

35:47.189 --> 35:48.815
I'm not really into boyfriends.

35:49.441 --> 35:51.568
I was married once.

35:51.735 --> 35:53.111
It was a total disaster.

35:53.237 --> 35:58.450
Plus,I love my work,and I travel a lot,on
top of which I'm incredibly selfish...

35:59.660 --> 36:00.828
and stubborn.

36:00.994 --> 36:03.997
I know what I want and I don't really
have the patience to bullshit around it

36:04.032 --> 36:07.417
so basically I just reach out and
grab whatever I have the urge for.

36:07.459 --> 36:08.669
What's your deal?

36:09.336 --> 36:10.337
Me?

36:10.504 --> 36:11.880
I'm,you know...

36:12.214 --> 36:14.925
- I justed...
- I can't really hear you.

36:15.551 --> 36:17.719
I... I...

36:18.679 --> 36:23.851
like I told you the
- the other night,you know,I'm married and

36:24.476 --> 36:26.770
Yeah,you're married,likes
to drink. What else?

36:26.854 --> 36:32.317
Well,technically still married,... you know,separated since
- Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

36:32.359 --> 36:34.111
Kids.

36:34.403 --> 36:35.237
Yeah.

36:35.654 --> 36:36.780
4-3.

36:37.322 --> 36:38.490
3 kids.

36:39.241 --> 36:43.662
My son was... killed by a

36:44.079 --> 36:46.415
drunk driver when he was... 9.

36:47.541 --> 36:48.917
So...

36:50.502 --> 36:51.587
Girlfriend?

36:51.753 --> 36:52.796
Uh,kind of.

36:53.297 --> 36:54.381
Jesus christ!

36:54.506 --> 36:56.049
Chase,chase,cut to the chase.

36:56.216 --> 37:02.264
I'm-I slept-used to sleep
with my cousin's-well...

37:02.431 --> 37:03.849
wife-widow.

37:04.141 --> 37:05.309
I know,it doesn't-it's
not what it sounds like.

37:05.475 --> 37:06.560
He was killed on 9/11.

37:06.727 --> 37:07.311
And...

37:07.519 --> 37:09.438
it's very- it's complicated.

37:10.230 --> 37:11.190
Firefighter.

37:11.356 --> 37:12.482
Yes.

37:17.905 --> 37:19.531
I thought I was a mess.

37:20.365 --> 37:21.742
But I like this.

37:22.451 --> 37:23.535
It's intriguing.

37:24.244 --> 37:26.872
I'm kind of a drama queen,and
apparently,so are you.

37:27.206 --> 37:30.083
No,no,no
- The david bowie eye thing works for me.

37:30.167 --> 37:31.543
Tall and blond works for me.

37:31.835 --> 37:32.628
Totally in my wheelhouse.

37:32.753 --> 37:37.382
I remember the other night when you had your hands
on me,they had calluses,working man hands,I like that.

37:37.508 --> 37:40.052
And I really dug the way you kissed,too.

37:40.135 --> 37:44.806
I should mention at this point that
- 'cause of my job I'm out of town mostly during the week

37:44.848 --> 37:49.645
so I'm only around on weekends,and when I'm here,I need a
guy that pays full attention to my needs,in and out of bed.

37:49.728 --> 37:50.854
We good?

37:52.147 --> 37:52.981
Great.

37:53.607 --> 37:54.983
Now get out.

37:55.150 --> 37:56.235
You want me to go?

37:56.360 --> 37:57.069
Yeah.

37:57.194 --> 37:58.529
I'm gonna smoke some weed and crash.

37:58.654 --> 38:00.030
Ok,so,what-what-

38:02.491 --> 38:03.033
It's ok.

38:03.116 --> 38:03.951
I just banged my head.

38:03.992 --> 38:05.202
Ok.

38:13.585 --> 38:16.129
Not as good as I remembered,but
you'll work on that.

38:16.797 --> 38:17.756
Ok.

38:18.924 --> 38:20.050
Banged my head.

38:20.175 --> 38:21.927
hey.

38:22.636 --> 38:24.429
Sorry about your kid,by the way.

38:26.056 --> 38:27.057
Thanks.

38:30.394 --> 38:31.770
It's,

38:33.564 --> 38:36.233
well,you never really get over
something like that,do you?

38:38.652 --> 38:41.029
No. No.

38:43.365 --> 38:44.908
See you.

38:45.909 --> 38:47.161
Ok.

38:48.829 --> 38:53.041
- Oh,hey,that's the... that's the box.
- Yeah.

38:53.083 --> 38:54.710
- Can I see what-
- No.

39:05.095 --> 39:07.222
all right,so I guess I'm just gonna go.

39:07.389 --> 39:09.725
Ok! You know where the door is.

39:09.892 --> 39:11.018
I'll call you.

39:11.393 --> 39:12.686
Ok.

39:19.985 --> 39:21.695
You know,kelly...

39:32.039 --> 39:32.789
What?

39:32.915 --> 39:34.708
Hey

39:35.000 --> 39:35.876
What?

39:36.919 --> 39:38.128
I just...

39:38.378 --> 39:39.922
- What?
- What?

39:39.963 --> 39:41.465
Open the door.

39:43.509 --> 39:44.384
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:44.593 --> 39:45.260
Hi.

39:47.221 --> 39:47.888
Listen.

39:49.389 --> 39:51.975
I want to be completely honest with you,ok?

39:52.726 --> 39:58.482
And... I just wanted to tell
you that tonight I was...

39:58.649 --> 40:00.901
out having dinner...

40:02.778 --> 40:04.029
by myself.

40:04.238 --> 40:08.617
And I couldn't stop thinking
about you,and I was walking

40:08.659 --> 40:13.330
after that and thinking about you and
I said,you know,I'm just gonna call her.

40:13.365 --> 40:17.709
I wasn't expecting a cab ride,I wasn't
expecting any,you know,kind of...

40:18.252 --> 40:21.713
hanky panky at all.

40:22.256 --> 40:27.928
Cause the thing that stayed with me from
the other night was the conversation and...

40:28.136 --> 40:29.930
how you made me laugh and...

40:30.597 --> 40:34.142
and even tonight,this-it was great.

40:34.810 --> 40:36.019
It was nice.

40:36.144 --> 40:37.104
Really?

40:40.148 --> 40:42.151
You still gotta go.

40:43.944 --> 40:45.320
Ok.

40:45.487 --> 40:47.698
It was a nice try,though.

40:49.116 --> 40:54.329
A little hanky panky would
have been-we don't have to do...

40:57.124 --> 40:58.458
I got it.

40:58.625 --> 41:00.085
All right,bye.
