WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.049
-[Lisa] They arrested me.
-[Mickey] What?

00:08.133 --> 00:09.968
[Lisa] They said I killed
Mitchell Bondurant.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.679
If the DA files for murder,
the bail will be high.

00:12.762 --> 00:15.265
-I don't have that kind of money.
-We'll figure it out.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.892
You choose high-profile clients
for a reason.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.186
You love all eyes being trained on you.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.605
The people charge Lisa Marie Trammell

00:22.689 --> 00:25.567
with the first-degree murder
of Mitchell Bondurant.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.986
[Judge] Bail will be set
at two million dollars.

00:28.069 --> 00:32.157
-Bondurant was found dead next to his car.
-[Mickey] The wound looks circular.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.784
So no murder weapon,
which means it's still out there.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.203
-That's good for us.
-As long as it never shows up.

00:37.287 --> 00:41.249
My friend, Henry, put up the bond for me.
Henry's a podcast producer.

00:41.332 --> 00:44.711
I don't know you. I don't trust you.
I want you far away from this case.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.089
[Teddy] I do believe that
maybe Kaz cut a deal.

00:48.173 --> 00:51.968
You'll stay on him until I'm satisfied
I know what I'm dealing with.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.012
I don't want you involved in this.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.473
I just gotta finish this one thing.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.767
-Lie to me again, and I'm out.
-What do you want?

00:58.850 --> 01:02.187
Not to go to the judge every time
I don't get something I'm entitled to.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.689
Just so you know,
there will not be a plea offer.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.399
Good. 'Cause we don't want one.

01:06.483 --> 01:10.028
You know I'm attracted to you,
but we have to keep it professional.

01:10.612 --> 01:11.488
Sure.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.406
[suspenseful music playing]

01:27.212 --> 01:28.546
[elevator dings]

01:45.647 --> 01:48.441
-[man] Where do you want this?
-How many more are there?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.318
About 80 total, give or take.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.736
Eighty more boxes?

01:51.820 --> 01:53.363
No, sandwiches.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.573
Yes, boxes. Where to?

01:55.657 --> 01:57.826
Wherever you see an empty space.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.160
What is all this?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.122
[sighs] This is discovery
for the Trammell case

02:02.205 --> 02:04.290
and a big middle finger
from Andrea Freemann.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.377
Old prosecutor's trick.
Bury the defense in paperwork.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.296
Bondurant's high school yearbook
is probably in one of these.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.132
Good thing you kept this office.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.175
There's no way
to pile these in the Lincoln.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.886
We're gonna need all hands on deck.
Where's Lorna?

02:20.431 --> 02:22.142
[cell phone rings]

02:23.309 --> 02:24.394
Hey, Izzy. What's up?

02:24.477 --> 02:26.020
[Izzy] Mickey's asking for you.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.022
We've got a situation here.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.941
Ugh. They've buried us in boxes.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.025
Uh-huh.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.527
[Lorna] Okay, I'm coming in.

02:32.610 --> 02:35.488
Cancel all your plans.
It's gonna be a very long day.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.707
Darn it. I am blind without my glasses.
Can you read the menu?

02:46.207 --> 02:48.751
I come here often.
I practically know it by heart.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.086
What is it you wanna know?

02:50.170 --> 02:53.464
Oh, uh, my boyfriend
wants to know the specials.

02:54.090 --> 02:57.969
Avocado toast. Why is that even a special?
It's on every menu in LA.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.096
I know, right? Calm down, avocados.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.181
[woman chuckles]

03:01.264 --> 03:03.224
[woman] "Turkey meatloaf
with chili aioli."

03:03.308 --> 03:04.934
"Baby gem lettuce cups

03:05.018 --> 03:08.146
with bacon, brussels sprouts,
chicken, grapes, and almonds."

03:08.229 --> 03:10.523
Oh, "…in a champagne vinaigrette."

03:10.607 --> 03:14.777
It says all those words up there?
Maybe I really do need glasses.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.865
Oh, sorry. Just thinking out loud.
Great scarf.

03:22.785 --> 03:23.745
[Izzy] Wow.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.956
The police confiscated Lisa's entire life.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.625
Journal, laptop, clothes.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.877
Even her gardening equipment
and tool kits.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.587
[Cisco] Did they return the laptop?

03:33.087 --> 03:34.464
Yeah, it's on the list.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.841
[Cisco] I can go through
the recently opened files.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.594
Might be a window
into the prosecution's thinking.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.596
No, Freemann's too sneaky for that.

03:41.679 --> 03:45.600
If there was anything good in that laptop,
she'd bury it deep and cover her tracks.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.020
Whoa, I should've brought coffee.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.649
Uh, Lorna, what is that on the hound?

03:52.732 --> 03:56.319
I'm trying out tie colors. I was thinking
Winston could walk me down the aisle.

03:56.402 --> 03:57.570
Like a flower girl.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.616
What? I don't have any bridesmaids.
I have to have someone.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.409
Thought your sister was gonna be one.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.912
My sister will roll into this wedding
in a white dress

04:05.995 --> 04:07.705
and have no idea why I wanna strangle her.

04:07.789 --> 04:11.167
All right, now that we're all here,
can we, uh, get started?

04:12.168 --> 04:15.004
We need to answer
one simple question. Why?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.090
Why did the cops arrest Lisa Trammell?

04:17.173 --> 04:21.678
Some rich developer gets murdered.
Why is a chef the prime suspect?

04:22.345 --> 04:23.471
Well…

04:24.639 --> 04:25.848
What?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.517
[Lorna] I don't wanna say this out loud,

04:27.600 --> 04:32.146
but sometimes the simplest answer
is the right one. Maybe Lisa did it.

04:33.147 --> 04:34.983
Why wouldn't you say that out loud?

04:35.608 --> 04:38.278
Because you've never represented someone
you've slept with,

04:38.361 --> 04:41.447
and we're all watching
what we say around here

04:41.531 --> 04:44.826
because you're not exactly unbiased.

04:44.909 --> 04:46.077
[sighs]

04:46.703 --> 04:48.705
Okay, let's be clear on something.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.666
Lisa is a client.
Nothing more, nothing less.

04:51.749 --> 04:54.085
Like any client,
she deserves our full scrutiny.

04:54.168 --> 04:57.005
You think she's guilty?
Go ahead, make your case.

04:58.673 --> 04:59.507
Come on.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.056
-Okay.
-[Izzy chuckles]

05:08.266 --> 05:12.854
So Lisa and Bondurant were enemies.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.230
That was no secret.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.566
Bondurant did construction
in her neighborhood.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.192
He was messing up her restaurant,

05:18.276 --> 05:21.571
and he ordered
a temporary restraining order against Lisa

05:21.654 --> 05:25.366
when she protested at his office.
Plus, we all saw that police interview.

05:25.450 --> 05:29.203
She hated the guy.
All of this adds up to motive.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.957
Guy like Bondurant doesn't get where he is
without pissing off a lot of people.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.584
Lisa can't be his only enemy.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.379
But she is the only one a witness
can put at the scene of the crime.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.717
-Margot Schafer. Bondurant's receptionist.
-[cell phone vibrates]

05:42.800 --> 05:47.096
She saw Lisa walking away from the office
at the same time as the murder.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.639
That is opportunity.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.434
[Mickey] Lisa was at the farmers market.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.977
She goes there every week.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.855
As far as their witness,
Cisco, what do we have?

05:58.399 --> 05:59.275
Cisco?

05:59.817 --> 06:02.528
Sorry. Um, Margot Schafer.

06:03.154 --> 06:07.408
She is a model citizen.
Uh, not so much as a parking ticket.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.286
Nothing weird about her relationship
with the victim,

06:10.370 --> 06:15.416
and the only line of attack might be
her perception on the day.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.086
Which is why
I tested her eyesight this morning.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.504
[scoffs] You-- You what?

06:19.587 --> 06:22.507
I wanted to prove
that she saw what she said she saw.

06:22.590 --> 06:25.259
So I may have stalked her
at the cute local coffee shop.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.762
And turns out she has eagle eyes.

06:27.845 --> 06:28.805
And…

06:30.014 --> 06:31.224
[Lorna sighs]

06:31.307 --> 06:32.183
[Lorna] Mickey…

06:34.185 --> 06:35.603
I might need glasses.

06:37.271 --> 06:40.858
-All of that is beside the final point.
-Which is?

06:41.734 --> 06:46.030
It's subjective, granted,
but I get feelings about people.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.323
You know this, Mickey.

06:47.407 --> 06:51.244
And I just have a feeling
that there's something off about Lisa.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.080
You don't think that might be
your bias coming out?

06:54.163 --> 06:56.999
Luckily, your feelings
are not admissible in court, Lorna.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.378
Maybe so, but it does leave us
with motive and opportunity.

07:00.461 --> 07:04.715
Yeah, but not the means.
I mean, how did Lisa kill Bondurant?

07:04.799 --> 07:08.553
I've been thinking about
that circular wound on top of his head.

07:08.636 --> 07:12.140
Not a lot of things in that shape.
Maybe a hammer?

07:12.223 --> 07:14.434
-We have no evidence to indicate that--
-Um…

07:15.601 --> 07:19.188
About that. Remember I said that
the police confiscated Lisa's tool kit.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.234
It's one that comes in a case
where there's a space for every tool.

07:23.317 --> 07:28.322
It's supposed to have 150 pieces,
but it only has 149.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.325
Wanna guess which one's missing?

07:37.999 --> 07:40.001
[opening theme music playing]

07:47.758 --> 07:49.427
[Lisa sighs] I don't know, Mickey.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.013
I have no idea where that hammer is.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.765
God, the mess the police left here.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.435
It's a wonder I can find anything.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.854
Remember the last time you saw it?

08:00.521 --> 08:01.397
[Lisa] No.

08:02.106 --> 08:06.402
But I've had dozens of employees,
and they all had access to the shed.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.279
-[Mickey] Right.
-It wasn't even my tool kit.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.989
It's my ex's.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.868
-You think he could've misplaced it?
-Yeah, maybe.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.662
Can you call and ask him?

08:19.790 --> 08:22.502
Yeah, I don't speak to him anymore,
Mickey.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.588
He wouldn't remember anyway.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.634
Knowing Jeff, he doesn't even remember
what he had for breakfast.

08:29.717 --> 08:32.345
This isn't just about
a missing hammer, Lisa.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.306
Your ex-husband may come up in the trial.

08:35.806 --> 08:39.685
The prosecution will dig through your past
and find anything to make you look bad.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.020
What are you saying?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.231
[Mickey] I'm not saying. I'm asking.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.983
Is there anything about your ex
that could be a problem?

08:49.570 --> 08:52.281
All right. Can you at least tell me why
you got divorced?

08:58.913 --> 09:00.498
I'm an ambitious person.

09:00.581 --> 09:04.418
When my food truck took off,
I wanted to open a brick-and-mortar,

09:04.502 --> 09:05.920
and we already had the space.

09:06.003 --> 09:09.590
Jeff was more interested in smoking weed
and playing guitar all day.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.134
Something just changed in the marriage.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.137
I wanted more.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.515
He didn't want any part of it.

09:18.683 --> 09:23.271
We just grew apart, you know?
Nothing mean. Nothing bad.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.943
Honestly, it was just sad. [sighs]
You know what I mean?

09:31.070 --> 09:31.988
Yeah.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.073
Think he'll talk to me?

09:35.491 --> 09:36.742
If you can find him.

09:37.493 --> 09:40.162
You said he was in Mexico, right?
Ensenada?

09:40.246 --> 09:43.666
Last I heard,
but who knows if he's there anymore.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.837
-He wasn't exactly a model of stability.
-Excuse me. Lisa.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.551
Shit, I-- I really gotta get back
to work, Mickey.

09:53.634 --> 09:54.468
Of course.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.013
I'm having a community dinner tonight.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.307
It's pay what you can.

10:00.016 --> 10:03.269
I do it once a month for
lower-income families in the neighborhood.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.478
Wow, that's great.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.563
Yeah.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.482
Hopefully, people will show up.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.068
Hey.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.155
Are you okay?

10:16.365 --> 10:18.326
I'm sorry. I'm just, um…

10:20.036 --> 10:22.288
[exhales] I'm dealing with a lot.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.331
Yeah.

10:25.416 --> 10:28.002
Besides the crimp in my social calendar…

10:30.004 --> 10:33.507
turns out being accused of murder
isn't great for business.

10:34.592 --> 10:38.054
Our reservations are way down
since I've been arrested and…

10:40.139 --> 10:44.352
[chuckles] I honestly don't know
what I would do without you, Mickey.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.399
Love for you to come to the event tonight.

10:51.025 --> 10:53.694
I mean, if you can.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.823
Having my lawyer there
might make people feel like

10:58.866 --> 11:01.535
maybe their chef isn't
a cold-blooded killer after all.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.954
I'll try to make it.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.624
[mouths] Okay.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.128
I'd better get inside.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.010
[cell phone ringing]

11:25.184 --> 11:27.144
Hey, Terrell. What's going on?

11:27.228 --> 11:28.229
[beeping]

11:28.312 --> 11:31.065
Mickey, thank you for coming.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner.

11:31.148 --> 11:34.735
I thought it was just kid shit. Judge said
Angelica could get hit with a felony.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.529
[Mickey] First offense. Juvenile court.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.656
She'll probably get community service,

11:38.739 --> 11:40.908
and it's wiped off her record
when she turns 18.

11:40.991 --> 11:43.285
-Well, that's not the problem.
-What's the problem?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.955
Things aren't exactly chill
with Angelica's mom.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.415
All this happened on my watch.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.126
If anything happens to Angelica,
she'll use it against me.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.921
She can get my custody revoked.
I only get Angelica two days a week as is.

11:54.004 --> 11:58.008
And I got my shit together now.
I'm working in promos for the Lakers.

11:58.509 --> 12:01.429
Wha-- Hold up.
You want seats? I could hook it up.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.432
I haven't done a juvenile case
since I was a public defender.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.976
That's 15 years ago.
Sure you don't want somebody else?

12:07.059 --> 12:10.396
No way, Mickey Haller.
I need the big guns for my baby.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.481
[sighs]

12:15.818 --> 12:16.694
All right, come on.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.956
Angelica. I'm Mickey.
I'm gonna be your lawyer, all right?

12:30.124 --> 12:34.295
I thought my dad was kidding when he said
he'd get the lawyer from the bus stop ads.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.506
-Do you get real business off those?
-[chuckles] I do.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.760
Cool. I'll tell my friend
to stop drawing dicks on your face.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.640
Mr. Haller, it's been a while.

12:48.476 --> 12:49.643
You don't remember.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.981
I was one of the juvenile DAs
when you were a public defender.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.152
Your career
has certainly taken off since then.

12:58.235 --> 12:59.528
As has yours, Your Honor.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.488
[she chuckles]

13:00.571 --> 13:02.406
Well, you can drop the formality.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.201
We like to keep things casual here.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.535
It's Judge Sandy.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.413
Uh, lollipop?

13:09.497 --> 13:12.458
No, thanks, Your Honor.
Thank you. Judge Sandy.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.251
[chuckles] Okay.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.754
Very well. Uh…

13:16.837 --> 13:20.216
Then just a little housekeeping matter
before we begin.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.051
Tardiness.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.182
Yes, Your Honor.
I apologize for being late.

13:28.265 --> 13:31.185
Uh, I was just brought on
as Miss Coleman's counsel, so--

13:31.268 --> 13:34.939
Excuses don't give me thrills
and don't pay my bills, Mr. Haller.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.191
-Right.
-[judge] We get the newspaper here too.

13:37.274 --> 13:39.985
I've no doubt you are busy
with all your press commitments,

13:40.069 --> 13:44.657
but the next time you are late,
I will find you in contempt,

13:44.740 --> 13:47.034
and you can expect the maximum fine.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.163
Are we good?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.874
Very good, Judge Sandy.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.544
Wonderful. Ernest.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.337
Thank you, Judge Sandy.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.882
The victim in this case, Karen Foster,
is the owner of the Lux…

14:01.966 --> 14:04.677
-[quietly] Is this the lady I saw outside?
-Yeah.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.388
[Ernest] Miss Foster alleges
that Miss Coleman vandalized her store

14:07.471 --> 14:09.765
causing over $2,000 worth of damage.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.351
I'm sorry, I-- I just see a black wall.

14:12.434 --> 14:13.936
The wall was previously white.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.524
Okay, am I-- Am I missing something?

14:19.608 --> 14:21.443
It's an homage to Virgil Abloh.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.863
The fashion designer?

14:24.822 --> 14:28.325
Off-White?
Anyway, they sell Off-White at her store,

14:28.409 --> 14:30.953
and he died, and I wanted to honor him.

14:31.620 --> 14:34.373
He put words and quotes on his designs
to comment on things.

14:34.456 --> 14:38.711
I see pink and white walls all over LA.
I've never seen a black one.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.132
Judge, um, sidebar? Please?

14:43.215 --> 14:46.051
You see the size of this room, Mr. Haller?

14:46.135 --> 14:48.053
We can all hear everything.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.973
But if you'd like to pretend
we're downtown,

14:51.056 --> 14:54.310
you're welcome to speak
in hushed whispers by my chair.

14:55.060 --> 14:55.895
Thank you.

14:58.147 --> 15:02.818
Your Honor-- Judge Sandy, this is silly.
I mean, she's obviously a smart girl.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.655
Can't we drop the charges?
She will happily paint over the wall.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.700
I'm afraid Miss Foster insists
on pressing charges.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.660
Her store's been tagged nonstop recently.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.246
She wants to make a point
so it doesn't happen again.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.123
Maybe we can work out a diversion,

15:16.206 --> 15:19.251
but your client's gonna have to spend
some time on probation.

15:20.419 --> 15:24.840
[sighs] Can I ask for a continuance, then?
I have a full docket and--

15:24.924 --> 15:29.136
So do I, Mr. Haller,
and I can't afford a Lincoln.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.681
I'll give you one day. No more.

15:32.765 --> 15:33.974
Thank you.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.185
Sure you don't want a lollipop?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.604
The watermelon are really good.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.482
Thank you.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.654
I wasn't vandalizing her store. It's art.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.573
Conceptual, but still art.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.242
I'm not an art critic, Angelica.
I'm your lawyer.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.410
What are we gonna do?

15:53.494 --> 15:57.081
I'll think of something. In the meantime,
keep the art in your notebook.

15:57.164 --> 15:58.540
-[cell phone chimes]
-Okay.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.669
-All right. I'll call you.
-All right.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.837
[pensive music playing]

16:20.229 --> 16:23.232
[camera clicking]

16:30.406 --> 16:33.200
Andy. What couldn't wait
until after lunch?

16:33.283 --> 16:35.285
Do you have more discovery for me?

16:35.369 --> 16:37.371
Maybe a chance for you to avoid it.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.706
Against my better judgment,

16:38.789 --> 16:41.417
my office is willing
to offer your client a plea.

16:42.167 --> 16:46.588
You told me there would be no plea offer,
and you spent all that taxpayer money

16:46.672 --> 16:49.174
delivering a truckload of boxes
to my office, so--

16:49.258 --> 16:50.342
[Andrea] Don't overthink it.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.679
The new mandate from Cardone.
Saving department time and resources.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.097
Blah, blah, blah.

16:55.180 --> 16:59.893
We'll go down to voluntary manslaughter.
Midterm, six years.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.982
Well, that's-- That's not crazy, at least.

17:05.065 --> 17:09.028
Seriously? We're coming down
off of premeditated and lying in wait.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.238
If you come down to an involuntary…

17:11.321 --> 17:13.657
I'd like to see even you
make a case for that.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.577
What, she just happened to hit him
over the head in his garage?

17:16.660 --> 17:18.954
Come on. She wasn't in the garage.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.082
You have the offer, Haller.
Will she take it or not?

17:24.835 --> 17:27.087
I don't know. I'll try to sell it.

17:27.171 --> 17:31.467
My advice would be that you do
because it's one time and one time only.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.386
You have until tomorrow,
then it's off the table.

17:34.470 --> 17:35.554
I'll talk to her.

17:36.638 --> 17:37.556
Tomorrow.

17:47.608 --> 17:49.485
[Mickey] Department mandate.
[speaks Spanish]

17:49.568 --> 17:51.028
[Lorna] Sounds plausible to me.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.322
Freemann notches up a win.
Doesn't have to do any work.

17:53.405 --> 17:57.618
No. I could have kicked her off this case,
and she did everything to stay on it.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.496
She wants to go to trial.
She wants the spotlight.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.165
She wants to beat me again.
It's not gonna happen.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.209
Maybe it really is a mandate
from her boss.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.460
[Mickey] I don't buy that.

18:06.543 --> 18:10.923
No DA gets reelected pleading murders out,
especially high-profile ones.

18:11.006 --> 18:14.676
If they're offering that,
it's because there's something wrong.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.553
Her case has a flaw. A fatal one.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.473
She's burying us with discovery
because she's hiding it.

18:19.556 --> 18:23.393
And we have 24 hours to find out
what that is. 23 and a half now.

18:23.477 --> 18:27.397
If I keep pulling all-nighters,
they'll have to carry me down the aisle.

18:27.481 --> 18:30.609
Plus, I've been through all the forensics.
I've got nothing.

18:30.692 --> 18:34.363
We can start pulling financial statements.
Maybe there's something there.

18:34.446 --> 18:39.326
All right. Let's look for enemies,
angry business partners, jealous lovers.

18:39.409 --> 18:42.538
Anyone who had a grudge
against Bondurant. Where's Cisco, huh?

18:42.621 --> 18:44.998
-Talking to the witness on Lisa's TRO.
-[Mickey] Good.

18:45.082 --> 18:48.418
If we can discredit that witness,
then the TRO is dead in the water.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.755
That's a rung out of their ladder,
but this is the whole ladder.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.132
Let's knock it down.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.883
[pensive music playing]

19:00.848 --> 19:05.269
Mickey, you're letting Andrea get
under your skin. You know that, right?

19:05.352 --> 19:08.397
She's damn good, Lorna.
Maybe even better than Maggie.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.899
Don't tell anyone I said that, all right?

19:11.733 --> 19:14.319
-Where you going?
-I have to bring this plea deal to Lisa.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.404
I have no choice.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.447
Don't forget you have Hayley tonight.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.991
I didn't forget.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.285
-Definitely forgot.
-Yep.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.505
The manager says you're looking for me?
About the building permit?

19:34.464 --> 19:35.382
Walter Kim?

19:35.465 --> 19:38.635
That's me. But if you need paperwork,
you need to go down to city hall.

19:38.719 --> 19:43.557
You were a witness on a temporary
restraining order against Lisa Trammell.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.475
So this isn't about the permit.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.853
I'm calling security.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.271
[Cisco] That's your right.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.107
It's my right to file a complaint
about corruption

19:52.191 --> 19:54.443
in the building inspector's office.

19:54.526 --> 19:58.447
Hold on. What corruption?
Who are you anyway?

19:58.530 --> 20:01.950
Lisa Trammell's being accused of a crime
she didn't commit.

20:02.034 --> 20:07.915
One of the reasons for that is this TRO
in which you state she was violent.

20:07.998 --> 20:10.876
She was. Now Mitchell Bondurant is dead,

20:10.959 --> 20:14.463
and you're throwing around accusations
like you know what the hell's up.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.465
Big developer like Bondurant?

20:16.548 --> 20:20.302
He carries a lot of clout
with city inspectors, so I get it.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.763
He asked you to vouch
for his side of the story.

20:22.846 --> 20:23.972
It's not like that.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.142
[Cisco] You were the only witness

20:27.226 --> 20:30.103
who claimed to have seen Lisa
attacking Bondurant.

20:30.604 --> 20:34.566
And this whole TRO rested on your word.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.945
It's not just my word.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.167
[Henry] No, it's a little different
than film and TV.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.545
I actually produce true-crime podcasts.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.881
Murder on the Hudson?
You may have heard of it?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.509
-Mm-mm.
-No? Ah, it was really great.

21:00.592 --> 21:03.387
It was a hit on the New York Times list
for three months--

21:03.470 --> 21:04.471
[Mickey] Excuse me.

21:05.973 --> 21:06.848
Thank you.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.644
Mr. Haller.
Lisa told me you might show up.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.771
Yeah, well,
what did I tell you about that?

21:12.854 --> 21:14.106
I'm not breaking any rules.

21:14.189 --> 21:17.234
I haven't interviewed Lisa,
just her loyal supporters.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.861
-Now that you're here, did you--
-Don't point that at me.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.572
I still don't want you posting
anything you record.

21:23.573 --> 21:27.619
We got the truth on our side, Mickey.
Nobody's hiding anything.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.998
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.165
You made it.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.501
Hey, can we talk in private real quick?

21:35.210 --> 21:36.503
Yeah. Let's take a walk.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.341
[Lisa] A plea deal?

21:42.050 --> 21:43.719
As in, plead guilty?

21:43.802 --> 21:48.098
[Mickey] It's voluntary manslaughter,
which is a huge step down from murder one.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.057
[Lisa groans]

21:49.641 --> 21:50.934
I didn't say to take it.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.603
I'm required to bring you any offer
from the prosecution.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.814
You didn't say I shouldn't take it either.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.109
It's not my call, Lisa.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.695
No. No, the answer is no.

22:01.778 --> 22:04.781
I'm not going to plead guilty
to something I didn't do.

22:05.657 --> 22:09.036
[sighs] Okay, well, at least
let me explain the offer first.

22:09.953 --> 22:13.707
Voluntary manslaughter
carries a max sentence of 11 years,

22:13.790 --> 22:15.042
suffering six.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.462
Good behavior,
you'll be out in less than five.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.047
[scoffs] I don't believe this.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.508
What about my restaurant, Mickey?

22:23.592 --> 22:25.844
My career? Hell, my life?

22:26.511 --> 22:28.221
What about the alternative?

22:28.305 --> 22:31.350
Which is going to trial
and showing everyone the truth.

22:31.433 --> 22:35.937
If the justice system were that simple,
innocent people would never be accused.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.356
[Lisa sighs]

22:37.439 --> 22:39.232
[Mickey] Your trial is a gamble.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.903
If we lose, Lisa, it's…

22:43.487 --> 22:45.322
It's life without parole.

22:48.283 --> 22:49.493
[Lisa gasps]

22:52.496 --> 22:53.789
Oh my God.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.173
Come on. You okay?

23:03.256 --> 23:05.467
[tender music playing]

23:12.015 --> 23:12.849
[sighs]

23:19.606 --> 23:24.361
You know, this… nice path wasn't here
when I was a kid. [chuckles]

23:28.532 --> 23:30.659
You came down here at your own risk.

23:32.536 --> 23:35.372
Well, see? Not all gentrification is bad.

23:35.455 --> 23:36.581
[scoffs]

23:41.878 --> 23:43.380
What should I do, Mickey?

23:48.718 --> 23:50.178
Okay. We have until tomorrow,

23:50.262 --> 23:53.473
so give me one night
to see if I can find something.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.067
The building inspector took these?

24:04.151 --> 24:06.278
[Cisco] He's the witness on the TRO.

24:11.491 --> 24:12.742
[Mickey] Oh shit.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.455
I told Lisa to give us a night
to find something,

24:16.538 --> 24:18.039
and everything we find is bad.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.374
[Izzy] There is some good news.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.043
We cross-referenced Bondurant's books
with his tax return.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.505
Turns out he was bleeding money.
Took a $200 million loss last year.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.673
200 million?

24:26.756 --> 24:28.467
[Izzy] Uh-huh. Two, zero, zero.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.178
[Cisco] Most of it's connected to
an unfinished apartment complex

24:31.261 --> 24:32.679
called "The Terrazzo."

24:33.472 --> 24:36.475
-That big ugly thing off the 110?
-[Cisco] That's the one.

24:36.558 --> 24:41.938
It was sitting empty for three years,
bleeding Bondurant dry. Permitting issues.

24:42.022 --> 24:46.109
There were questions about
exceeding zoning limits. In LA, go figure.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.320
Plenty of players involved, Mick.

24:48.403 --> 24:51.364
Bondurant owed money to a lot of people.

24:51.448 --> 24:55.243
[Mickey] Which means a lot of suspects,
so divide and conquer.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.413
We're looking for anything in those files
that mention The Terrazzo.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.831
[Lorna] I'm way ahead of you.

24:59.915 --> 25:03.710
I already sent you your share of the work,
plus a bit extra for those all-nighters.

25:03.793 --> 25:04.920
Yeah, I can't wait.

25:05.420 --> 25:08.715
[Mickey] We're gonna find it,
whatever Freemann's afraid of. Keep it up.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.010
[sighs]

25:21.394 --> 25:22.521
[Lorna] Where you going?

25:23.063 --> 25:25.815
Uh, I gotta take care of something.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.527
If I don't do it now, it, uh…

25:29.194 --> 25:30.779
Yeah. Can't wait.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.364
Does it have to do with Kaz?

25:32.447 --> 25:35.408
I usually drive him
to his parole officer meeting,

25:35.492 --> 25:38.662
but this morning,
he canceled on me, and then he…

25:40.455 --> 25:43.166
[sighs] He might be doing
something stupid.

25:43.250 --> 25:47.295
And if I don't deal with it now,
then it's gonna go bad for him.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.547
And for you?

25:50.131 --> 25:51.800
I gotta put an end to this.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.052
All of it.

26:00.141 --> 26:05.438
Izzy and I have things here under control.
Hurry back. You hear me? And be careful.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.108
Hey.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.069
Be careful.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.655
[pensive music playing]

26:27.919 --> 26:29.379
[Mickey sighs]

26:40.223 --> 26:41.558
[sighs] That…

26:43.018 --> 26:44.311
Can I get another Coke?

26:45.478 --> 26:46.938
Only if I get half.

26:48.189 --> 26:49.190
All right.

26:50.859 --> 26:55.196
Whatever you're working on must be even
more boring than my homework.

26:55.280 --> 26:59.159
[Mickey] It's real estate documents.
I don't understand half of them.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.038
I'm gonna have to make
a pot of coffee later.

27:03.997 --> 27:08.043
Well, when I can't focus,
I switch subjects for a minute.

27:08.668 --> 27:09.628
Usually helps.

27:11.921 --> 27:14.507
Yeah. That's a good idea.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.718
[groans]

27:30.857 --> 27:36.112
If you saw this on the side of a building,
would you think it's art or vandalism?

27:37.656 --> 27:40.742
It just looks like a cool place
to take a selfie.

27:40.825 --> 27:43.828
You know, it's like the, um,
the pink Paul Smith wall,

27:43.912 --> 27:45.455
or those angel wings.

27:45.538 --> 27:48.083
-Hmm.
-We're always looking for the next thing.

27:50.210 --> 27:53.755
Right. Influencers make a lot of money
out of these, right?

27:53.838 --> 27:56.841
Yeah, sure. Especially if it goes viral.

28:09.145 --> 28:13.316
Hey, Terrell. I have an idea.
You say you're working for the Lakers.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.112
[Izzy] Hey, I don't mean to be nosy,

28:17.195 --> 28:20.865
but, uh, did you ever talk to Cisco
about those credit card charges?

28:20.949 --> 28:23.368
Yeah, we're good.
At least he wasn't cheating on me.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.911
Yeah, I didn't think so.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.665
He was just dealing with some stuff
with an old friend.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.750
Someone from the Road Saints?

28:31.835 --> 28:36.881
Sorta. And he didn't want me to worry,
which only made it worse.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.091
Mm.

28:38.174 --> 28:43.221
I don't know if you've noticed,
but he's not exactly the most chatty.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.515
[chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, I got that.

28:47.183 --> 28:49.769
So, uh, is that where he is now?

28:51.229 --> 28:52.522
Unfortunately.

28:55.775 --> 28:56.651
Lorna.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.740
Is Cisco okay?

29:04.784 --> 29:06.161
Honestly, I don't know.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.376
[Izzy exhales]

29:15.879 --> 29:17.881
[suspenseful music playing]

29:48.203 --> 29:49.204
[lock clicking]

29:53.917 --> 29:55.084
[Kaz] Cisco, what the fuck?

29:55.168 --> 29:57.378
Why are you looking
over your shoulder, Kaz?

29:58.254 --> 30:00.340
-You worried about something?
-No, I was--

30:00.423 --> 30:02.258
Oh, you're going somewhere, huh?

30:03.676 --> 30:05.220
Were you even gonna say goodbye?

30:08.264 --> 30:10.934
Teddy thinks you're a rat,

30:11.017 --> 30:15.021
and I swore on my life that you weren't
because I trusted you.

30:16.564 --> 30:18.900
But I guess I was wrong.

30:24.322 --> 30:25.406
You following me?

30:30.245 --> 30:33.248
-It's not like that.
-Yeah? What's it like, Kaz? Hmm?

30:33.331 --> 30:34.666
Who are you meeting with?

30:36.167 --> 30:37.293
[Kaz sighs]

30:38.545 --> 30:39.546
The feds.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.173
I didn't have a choice.

30:42.257 --> 30:44.717
Shit went down in Corcoran,
and this guy jumped up.

30:44.801 --> 30:48.137
One thing led to another, and I--
It was self-defense!

30:48.221 --> 30:51.891
And the fed, the guy in the photo,
they were gonna use it to lean on me.

30:52.517 --> 30:55.520
[hesitates] Cisco, they were
gonna charge me with murder.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.605
Why didn't you tell me?

30:58.815 --> 31:00.400
I didn't wanna get you involved.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.820
I had to get out from under this.

31:03.903 --> 31:07.532
I can run from the Saints,
but I can't run from the feds.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.534
What did you tell your handler?

31:09.617 --> 31:13.496
I told him Hard Case Casey got hammered
and ran his mouth about a gun run.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.999
Six figures of metal
traveling through the clubhouse.

31:16.082 --> 31:18.209
Now my fingerprints
are nowhere near this deal.

31:18.293 --> 31:22.130
So I figured it'd be
a good piece of info to trade.

31:22.213 --> 31:25.884
If anything, Teddy's gonna think
it was Casey who tipped off ATF.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.093
No, you fuck!

31:27.719 --> 31:30.388
I already told you
Teddy thinks you're the snitch.

31:30.889 --> 31:34.475
And if the ATF raids him,
then he'll know it's you,

31:34.559 --> 31:36.853
and he'll blame me
'cause I vouched for you!

31:39.105 --> 31:40.273
Let me talk to my guy.

31:40.982 --> 31:44.694
I'm gonna talk to my guy.
He's puttin' me in witness protection.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.947
Maybe he can help you. I can--

31:49.449 --> 31:50.617
[Cisco scoffs]

31:51.910 --> 31:53.328
I got a new life,

31:54.370 --> 31:57.373
a good job, a woman that I love.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.251
And I can't just walk away.

32:01.294 --> 32:02.712
And I won't walk away.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.091
This whole situation, it is fucked!

32:11.346 --> 32:13.431
[crickets chirping]

32:33.117 --> 32:35.370
[pensive music playing]

32:51.260 --> 32:52.845
[line rings]

32:52.929 --> 32:54.597
[Cisco] Leave me a message.

32:54.681 --> 32:55.682
[line beeps]

32:55.765 --> 32:57.350
Cisco, it's me. Call me back.

32:57.433 --> 33:00.561
I think I've got something,
but I need you on it ASAP.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.066
[cell phone rings]

33:08.319 --> 33:10.196
-Hey, Mick.
-[Mickey] Hey. Any luck over there?

33:10.279 --> 33:13.366
No, just a bunch of emails from Bondurant
bullying people.

33:13.449 --> 33:15.284
Employees, tenants.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.453
The custodian
for not taking out the trash.

33:17.537 --> 33:21.916
-Any luck with those credit card reports?
-He spent $1,000 on a single massage.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.669
Although that sounds like motive
to keep someone alive.

33:24.752 --> 33:27.505
Also, I'm guessing
it wasn't just a massage.

33:27.588 --> 33:30.049
This feels like
a weird game of Clue, Mick.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.719
It was the janitor
in the parking garage with a pipe.

33:32.802 --> 33:34.804
Well, I think I found something.

33:34.887 --> 33:38.057
An email from Bondurant
to a guy named Alex Grant.

33:38.141 --> 33:40.977
He was a contractor at The Terrazzo.
Listen to this.

33:41.060 --> 33:44.856
"I, therefore, demand a full refund
of all payments made thus far."

33:44.939 --> 33:46.566
"If we cannot agree on terms,

33:46.649 --> 33:48.943
I will have no choice
but to pursue this matter

33:49.027 --> 33:50.945
through the appropriate legal channels."

33:51.029 --> 33:53.698
"Reporting it to our lenders,
which, as fiduciaries,

33:53.781 --> 33:57.702
are required under federal law
to report any suspicious activity."

33:57.785 --> 34:01.039
-Hmm.
-Which means… what exactly?

34:01.122 --> 34:04.250
A suspicious activity report
is a form banks have to file

34:04.333 --> 34:07.003
when they suspect wrongdoing
in a financial transaction.

34:07.086 --> 34:09.172
The bank has to report it
to the authorities.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.632
He'll go to the feds
if he doesn't get what he wants?

34:11.716 --> 34:14.010
[Lorna] And Bondurant is
demanding millions

34:14.093 --> 34:15.428
even though he owes millions.

34:15.511 --> 34:17.555
This sounds like Bondurant's MO.

34:17.638 --> 34:20.099
Yeah, but the question is this.
What was the threat?

34:20.183 --> 34:23.686
What's the suspicious activity
the feds might be interested in?

34:23.770 --> 34:24.604
Is Cisco there?

34:25.229 --> 34:28.149
Uh, no, he--
He just ran out for a coffee run.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.194
I've been calling all day.
He doesn't answer. It's not like him.

34:31.277 --> 34:34.322
Oh, he just left his phone here, so…

34:34.822 --> 34:36.616
[Mickey sighs] Whatever. I gotta sleep.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.368
Just tell him to call me
first thing in the morning.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.661
I need him on this, Lorna.

34:40.745 --> 34:41.704
Okay, great.

34:41.788 --> 34:42.747
Good night.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.126
I swear, I never lie.

34:48.961 --> 34:49.796
Almost never.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.715
It's all good. I got your back.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.301
[pensive music playing]

35:19.408 --> 35:22.203
Mr. Haller,
what did I say about tardiness?

35:22.286 --> 35:25.414
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
I-I know I'm late and have no excuse.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.334
You can give me whatever fine
you think is appropriate.

35:28.417 --> 35:29.794
If you allow me a moment,

35:29.877 --> 35:33.714
I, uh, I think we can move this case
off your docket very quickly.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.424
May I?

35:37.051 --> 35:39.637
Don't even think about the watermelon.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.555
Right.

35:42.181 --> 35:45.017
Uh, can I confer with Karen?

35:45.726 --> 35:46.602
Sure.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.566
[Mickey] I know you've recommended
a diversion.

35:51.649 --> 35:55.027
The problem with a diversion
is that probation goes on her record.

35:55.111 --> 35:58.656
I'm gonna ask one more time
if you're open to dropping the charges.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.825
I mean, she's only 14.

36:00.908 --> 36:04.078
There are custody issues here
that have nothing to do with this case.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.956
She should have thought of that
before defacing my store.

36:07.456 --> 36:10.042
[Ernest] We can discuss
alternative sentencing with the judge.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.627
That's the best I can do.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.964
Okay. Then, uh, in that case,

36:15.047 --> 36:19.635
this is a copyright application
for my client's artwork titled Black Wall.

36:21.220 --> 36:24.765
I'm sorry. [scoffs]
Are you calling her graffiti art?

36:24.849 --> 36:28.186
She painted my wall without permission.
That's vandalism.

36:28.269 --> 36:30.438
I'm afraid
that's in the eye of the beholder.

36:30.521 --> 36:34.317
The law is very protective of artists
and their work. Street art included.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.402
But it doesn't negate
the vandalism charge.

36:36.485 --> 36:38.279
No, but this might.

36:38.362 --> 36:41.407
This is your store's Instagram page,
and that is a promotional post

36:41.490 --> 36:45.912
featuring one of your salespeople
in front of my client's protected artwork

36:45.995 --> 36:49.832
with former Laker
and seven-time NBA champion Robert Horry,

36:49.916 --> 36:51.918
without compensation, I must add.

36:52.418 --> 36:53.669
You can't be serious.

36:53.753 --> 36:56.422
This is not promotional material.

36:56.505 --> 37:00.301
It's just one of my employees posing
with some basketball player.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.053
[Mickey] Does the caption not say,

37:02.136 --> 37:06.182
"Shop at The Lux
like Laker Legend Big Shot Bob Horry"?

37:06.974 --> 37:09.227
I don't even handle our Instagram.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.103
He doesn't have a case, does he?

37:11.187 --> 37:15.566
Using my client's protected artwork
in your advertising without her permission

37:15.650 --> 37:18.903
opens you up to a lawsuit,
which I will happily file.

37:18.986 --> 37:21.822
That's if you really wanna
continue this dispute.

37:22.657 --> 37:24.367
Just give me a second.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.994
Take all the time you need.

37:31.832 --> 37:32.708
Well played.

37:33.376 --> 37:35.711
Even a blind squirrel finds a nut
now and then.

37:35.795 --> 37:36.754
[judge] Counsel.

37:39.048 --> 37:42.468
I told you I can hear every word in here.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.762
It's a wood-paneled shoebox.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.642
Very clever, Mr. Haller.

37:50.893 --> 37:53.104
Take a watermelon for the road.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.231
Oh. Thank you.

37:56.232 --> 37:59.652
I assume if we drop the charges,
your client will still repaint the wall?

37:59.735 --> 38:03.072
No, I don't think she wants the wall
repainted anymore. Do you, Karen?

38:04.282 --> 38:07.743
See, I was late today because
I drove by your store on the way here.

38:07.827 --> 38:09.996
There's already a line down the block.

38:10.079 --> 38:12.248
Amazing what a little publicity can do.

38:15.418 --> 38:20.423
Fine. Leave the wall as it is,
and I will drop all the charges.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.508
[Mickey] You'll do more than that.

38:22.591 --> 38:24.135
You'll pay Angelica royalties

38:24.218 --> 38:26.846
on all sales made
since her artwork went up.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.180
Say, 5%?

38:29.015 --> 38:30.016
[scoffs]

38:31.434 --> 38:33.561
-Two and a half.
-Three, and you have a deal.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.646
[upbeat music playing]

38:41.152 --> 38:43.404
When Terrell called me,
I thought he was crazy.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.865
He said, "You really want me to do what?"

38:45.948 --> 38:49.994
No, crazy was watching you sink
that Game 4 winner against the Kings.

38:50.077 --> 38:52.204
'02. You were at that game?

38:52.288 --> 38:54.165
I was a law student with no money.

38:54.248 --> 38:57.001
Had to watch it outside the Staples Center
on the big screen.

38:57.084 --> 39:00.296
If you need a new case, I've been known
to rob people in the playoffs.

39:00.379 --> 39:02.006
-[child] Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.759
You don't have to stand in the cold now.

39:04.842 --> 39:08.179
At least let me get you tickets to a game.
You guys can sit together.

39:08.262 --> 39:09.388
Don't worry about it.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.515
Are you sure? I owe you, Mickey Haller.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.309
Come on. I'm just happy to help.

39:13.392 --> 39:14.310
I'll pay.

39:15.394 --> 39:18.689
What? Karen isn't the only one
getting money off my work.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.233
People are raising money on social
to finance me,

39:21.317 --> 39:23.277
and now you got me royalties too?

39:24.070 --> 39:26.197
-What's your hourly?
-Okay.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.909
I'll just call it 500.
So gotta account for early traffic.

39:29.992 --> 39:32.536
So, that's what? Six hours worked,

39:32.620 --> 39:35.664
even though it was my dad
who came through with Big Shot Rob.

39:35.748 --> 39:40.878
So that's 3,000, but you're gonna give us
a friends-and-family discount, right?

39:41.462 --> 39:43.339
So, 2,500?

39:44.465 --> 39:46.133
Okay, if you say so.

39:46.217 --> 39:48.260
Great. You got Venmo?

39:48.344 --> 39:49.595
That's my baby right there.

39:49.678 --> 39:52.056
If she ever wants to be a lawyer,
you give me a call.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.392
-Thank you.
-Of course.

39:54.975 --> 39:56.435
I'll send you that invoice.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.608
[Cisco] Argel Construction,
Alex Grant's company.

40:02.691 --> 40:05.027
He's the contractor from The Terrazzo.

40:05.111 --> 40:09.824
The address is a building in Glendale,
but when I went down there,

40:09.907 --> 40:11.867
place was locked up tighter than a drum.

40:11.951 --> 40:15.413
So I looked up the building's owner.
Her name is Ada Kazarian.

40:15.496 --> 40:16.831
-Armenian?
-[Cisco] Uh-huh.

40:16.914 --> 40:19.834
Now, Grant isn't an Armenian name,

40:19.917 --> 40:22.086
but it didn't take me long to figure out

40:22.169 --> 40:27.091
that Alex Grant is, in fact,
Alex Kazarian, Ada's brother.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.510
Right, so he changed his name.
That's not a crime.

40:29.593 --> 40:30.970
Take a look at the last page.

40:33.556 --> 40:38.018
That is Ada and Alex's father,
Sasha Kazarian.

40:38.519 --> 40:42.690
He's currently serving 27 years
in a federal supermax

40:42.773 --> 40:44.859
from where, by all accounts,

40:44.942 --> 40:46.819
he continues to be the head

40:46.902 --> 40:49.947
of one of the biggest Armenian
crime families on the West Coast.

40:50.030 --> 40:51.740
[suspenseful music playing]

40:51.824 --> 40:54.076
Ah. Now, that's a reason
to change your name.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.202
Lorna!

40:55.286 --> 40:56.162
[Lorna] Yeah?

40:56.245 --> 40:58.456
You have that email
from Bondurant to Alex Grant?

40:58.539 --> 41:00.624
-Mm-hmm.
-Can you read it to me, please?

41:00.708 --> 41:03.294
"If we cannot agree on terms,
I will have no choice

41:03.377 --> 41:06.338
but to pursue this matter
through the appropriate legal channels."

41:06.422 --> 41:09.383
"That includes reporting it
to our lenders, which, as fiduciaries,

41:09.467 --> 41:12.428
are required under federal law
to report any suspicious activity."

41:12.511 --> 41:16.056
Okay, so this isn't a business dispute.
It's extortion.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.684
Mitchell Bondurant was bleeding money
from The Terrazzo,

41:18.767 --> 41:20.769
and he wanted Alex Grant
to share the burden,

41:20.853 --> 41:22.480
or he was going to expose him.

41:22.563 --> 41:24.148
But expose what?

41:24.231 --> 41:27.526
That Kazarian
is connected to organized crime?

41:27.610 --> 41:31.113
Maybe. Maybe he was skimming money,
and Bondurant wanted in.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.407
Maybe something else was going on.
I don't know.

41:33.491 --> 41:37.369
Either way, it's a compelling reason
to kill somebody, right?

41:38.412 --> 41:40.456
-Care to fill us in?
-Please.

41:40.539 --> 41:45.085
This is what Andrea was trying to hide,
which means we found a straw man.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.839
[cell phone ringing]

41:51.842 --> 41:53.052
I'm on pins and needles.

41:53.135 --> 41:55.262
We found something. Something good.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.014
Oh, thank God.

41:57.097 --> 42:00.392
Yeah. It's up to you,
and there's never any guarantee.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.770
So, what do you wanna do?

42:04.480 --> 42:06.732
If you found something,
then we fight, right?

42:07.942 --> 42:08.776
Right.

42:08.859 --> 42:10.069
I'll call you later.

42:10.152 --> 42:12.154
[tender music playing]

42:18.077 --> 42:20.287
Hey. Everything okay?

42:21.038 --> 42:22.790
Um, not yet.

42:22.873 --> 42:24.792
-But I'm working on it.
-[Lorna groans]

42:27.836 --> 42:28.963
Ahem.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.715
Uh,

42:31.799 --> 42:33.551
appreciate all your help.

42:34.093 --> 42:37.263
All in a day's work.
And I do mean a 24-hour day.

42:37.846 --> 42:39.390
-[Lorna chuckles]
-See ya.

42:39.473 --> 42:42.560
Oh! I thought you might
appreciate the red.

42:42.643 --> 42:44.186
Izzy suggested a tux.

42:45.271 --> 42:48.732
[groans] I'm not really in a position
to draw a line in the sand.

42:49.525 --> 42:51.110
-Am I?
-No.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.572
[funky music playing]

43:09.378 --> 43:10.212
So?

43:10.713 --> 43:13.924
No deal, Andy.
My client wants to go to trial.

43:15.926 --> 43:18.262
You buried it well, but we found it.

43:18.345 --> 43:21.765
Wait, is this about the plea deal?
I pulled that offer this morning.

43:22.975 --> 43:24.393
[Mickey hesitates]

43:24.476 --> 43:25.853
You said 24 hours.

43:25.936 --> 43:29.398
I said, "Until tomorrow."
It's semantics either way.

43:29.481 --> 43:32.484
But there's no longer an offer
for you to accept or reject.

43:33.902 --> 43:37.239
Let's just say
circumstances on the ground have changed.

43:39.617 --> 43:40.951
See you in court, Haller.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.045
[cell phone rings]

43:51.754 --> 43:53.422
What? We're going home.

43:53.505 --> 43:55.132
[Mickey] She just pulled the offer.

43:56.008 --> 43:57.885
She pulled the offer?

43:58.636 --> 44:00.929
-What does that mean?
-She's not afraid anymore.

44:01.013 --> 44:05.017
She found something. Something that'll
blow us out of the water.

44:05.100 --> 44:07.895
So now we have to figure out what that is.

44:08.437 --> 44:09.396
[Mickey] Yeah.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.608
Cancel your plans, everyone.

44:12.691 --> 44:14.818
It's gonna be another long night.

44:14.902 --> 44:17.404
