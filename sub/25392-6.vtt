00:26.318 --> 00:27.444
Quick! This way!

00:27.528 --> 00:28.529
Stay on 'em!

00:28.612 --> 00:29.947
Right there! Right there!

00:30.822 --> 00:32.866
Move! Move! Move!

00:41.500 --> 00:42.751
Okay. Okay.

00:45.254 --> 00:49.466
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.977
Mr. Cage!
You can release the little guppy.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.353
Or you can fight.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.272
The choice is yours.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.196
You think we lost him?

01:11.280 --> 01:13.240
Mr. Cage!

01:13.323 --> 01:14.324
Does it sound like we did?

01:19.955 --> 01:21.540
Hear me now.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.126
Search everywhere.

01:24.710 --> 01:25.711
There.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.588
- Above!
- Sweet Christmas.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.762
Up on the rooftop there!
Go! Go! Go!

01:35.846 --> 01:37.723
- Hurry.
- Find them!

01:42.853 --> 01:43.770
What?

01:44.313 --> 01:45.939
How we gonna make that?

01:46.023 --> 01:47.316
I can't make that.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.569
Oh, hell, no!

01:51.820 --> 01:52.821
God damn.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.075
You won't have to.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.916
Get him! Now!

02:22.976 --> 02:23.977
Damn.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.953
You got five seconds to tell me
why your boss invaded Harlem

02:42.037 --> 02:44.247
and what he wants with Raymond Jones.

02:45.332 --> 02:52.005
Five, four, three, two, one.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.092
Rassclaat!

02:56.593 --> 02:57.969
This way.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.472
Up there!

03:08.980 --> 03:11.316
I can't. He ain't gonna make it.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.969
How the hell you do that?

03:39.052 --> 03:41.138
Don't look so surprised, man.
Let's go.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.684
Damn. Look what you did to my leg, Luke.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.812
Supposed to save me, not hurt me. Shit.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.318
"Rassclaat."

03:56.445 --> 03:57.946
What does that even mean?

05:22.155 --> 05:24.032
That's a foul.
Didn't he see that?

05:24.115 --> 05:27.244
- They hesitating. They gonna lose.
- Huh? What you say?

05:27.327 --> 05:30.956
They got too much power,
too much talent. They cannot lose.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.458
<i>And now,
a WBPJ breaking news update.</i>

05:33.542 --> 05:37.337
<i>Tonight, a grisly discovery
at Harlem's Shirley Chisholm Complex</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:40.966
<i>turned a ribbon-cutting celebration
into a macabre nightmare.</i>

05:41.049 --> 05:45.095
<i>The visuals you are
about to see are deeply disturbing.</i>

05:45.178 --> 05:47.138
<i>Come on in!</i>

05:50.475 --> 05:53.603
<i>Three severed heads were placed
at the complex,</i>

05:53.687 --> 05:56.815
<i>owned by former councilwoman
Mariah Dillard.</i>

05:56.898 --> 06:00.402
<i>And with emerging reports
of an armed attack at a party</i>

06:00.485 --> 06:04.990
<i>thrown by Harlem-based Wall Street
impresario Raymond "Piranha" Jones</i>

06:05.073 --> 06:07.784
<i>and Mexican cartel-level violence,</i>

06:07.867 --> 06:11.204
<i>one wonders if there are
more ominous events ahead.</i>

06:11.288 --> 06:14.165
No matter where you go, savagery.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.417
Pure savagery.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.378
Where's the talent in that?
Where's the power?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.673
All I see is fear.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.025
Talk, bredren.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.111
Piranha's gone. He's running.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.405
- How?
<i>- Luke Cage.</i>

06:45.488 --> 06:46.489
Rassclaat.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.202
- You check the Harlem's Hero app?
- I did. Nothing yet.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.080
Call Irie Cabs. Tell Berchel I need...

06:54.164 --> 06:56.916
Done. He gave me four cabs
to cover the area.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.878
I don't want four cabs.
I want every cab.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.547
Flood the streets, and he'll float
to the surface. You hear?

07:02.631 --> 07:03.632
<i>Yeah, skipper.</i>

07:03.715 --> 07:05.800
And, Sheldon, hear me now.

07:06.384 --> 07:07.719
No weakness.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.346
No excuses.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.521
Move. Move!

07:44.506 --> 07:45.340
Psst!

07:46.841 --> 07:48.802
I'm good.
I don't need no ride, man.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.720
You seen Luke Cage?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.765
Nah, man.
The brother don't got a smoke signal.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.935
He just kinda shows up, right on time.

08:01.106 --> 08:05.402
Check the barbershop. Keep asking
around for him. He'll find you.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.486
We good?

08:07.904 --> 08:08.905
We're good.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.117
Walk good, bredren.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.924
Ma, I'm around the corner.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.218
Tell Aunt Val to stay at home.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.554
The streets is hot.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.655
Whew.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.116
Shit.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.911
Man, you gotta get me out of here.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.456
Not until you tell me
why the Stylers are after you.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.959
I ain't had no R&B group at my party.

09:45.543 --> 09:49.380
The Jamaicans, sucker, from Brooklyn.
Why are they after you?

09:49.464 --> 09:51.049
Or is it somebody you deal with?

09:51.966 --> 09:55.512
What's your connection to Mariah Dillard
and Shades Alvarez?

09:56.096 --> 09:59.849
Stacks. Bills. Gouda. Paper.
Greenbacks. Ducats.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.768
They're my clients. I get 'em paid.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.020
Hold up. Why are you questioning me?

10:04.104 --> 10:07.649
You work for me. I'm paying you.
You are my Hero for Hire.

10:07.732 --> 10:11.027
Well, where's my money, honey?
You still owe me from the party.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.405
Look, I'm good for it, okay?

10:14.489 --> 10:17.283
Just get me safe,
and I'll set you straight for life.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.244
Why should I protect you?

10:20.036 --> 10:21.663
You tried to shoot me for fun.

10:23.706 --> 10:27.919
I was just trippin', bro.
You know how we do. Come on, man.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.756
You're wasting my time.
We're done.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.926
You just gonna give your word
and take it back?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.348
Shit! Shit!

10:56.322 --> 10:59.159
Hey. That's very unprofessional,
brother, okay?

10:59.242 --> 11:03.538
No wonder you have a billion-dollar talent
but work out of the back of a barbershop.

11:14.549 --> 11:15.550
Hey.

11:16.718 --> 11:20.638
Hey, I didn't know you was that sensitive,
brother. My bad. My bad.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.605
It's sprained.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.939
I'm gonna splint it,

11:30.523 --> 11:32.567
and you're gonna tell me
everything I need to know.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.407
Sugar, guard the back.

11:39.490 --> 11:43.411
Anyone comes near it, shoot first.
No questions asked.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.872
I'm on it. What about the front?

11:45.955 --> 11:48.499
Let me worry about it.
We'll get more guys.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.168
Do you have time to get anybody?

11:51.961 --> 11:54.672
I'll take care of it.
Go wall off the back.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.175
Copy.

12:06.893 --> 12:07.894
Damn.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.731
Niggas are posted up outside
like it's the Alamo or some shit.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.651
- What's going on?
- Where you been?

12:14.734 --> 12:15.944
You ain't heard?

12:16.527 --> 12:19.656
They cut off Ray Ray's head and placed it
in front of Chisholm Complex.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.824
- What?
- Bushmaster.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.202
He killed Cockroach, too.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.996
Where the hell were you?
We're at war.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.166
You want us to all spill blood
with the Jamaican cats,

12:30.249 --> 12:33.461
who, against your advice,
she sold her gun business to?

12:34.504 --> 12:35.672
Your point?

12:37.507 --> 12:39.050
Ray Ray was good people.

12:40.927 --> 12:45.181
Now, the rest? The Jamaicans killed them
to put Mariah on front street.

12:46.057 --> 12:49.727
What's it got to do with you?

12:51.813 --> 12:54.107
Mariah gets back from the station,
we'll decide what to do.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.066
Decide?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.360
That's not a plan.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.154
You got a better one?

13:01.072 --> 13:04.575
Mariah's with the cops.
The Jamaicans are cutting heads off.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.955
Now, if you ask me,
I say it's time to cut the bitch loose.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.624
We're not doing that.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.173
What advice would you give you?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.511
You're getting way too emotional
about this shit.

13:31.686 --> 13:32.770
You're right.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.194
Where you going?

13:47.243 --> 13:50.663
They want Piranha
because they must be after the money.

13:50.747 --> 13:55.043
That fool has access to every dime
we earned on that Atreus Plastics deal.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.920
If we're gonna find him,

13:59.505 --> 14:00.923
we don't need to go big.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.967
That's probably what they expect.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.345
We need to go special forces
with this shit.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.347
Like old times.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.183
Me and you.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.109
I thought we sold all these.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.944
First rule of business?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.404
Never sell the good shit.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.573
Rivals?

14:25.656 --> 14:26.741
We ain't got none.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.511
How did your call with the chief go?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.096
I walked him through our theory

14:48.179 --> 14:51.516
that there's a connection between
the heads that turned up tonight,

14:51.599 --> 14:53.684
the attack on Raymond Jones' party,

14:53.768 --> 14:56.813
and the murders last week
of Arturo Rey in Harlem

14:56.896 --> 14:58.815
and Nigel Garrison in Brooklyn.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.859
Did you tell him the Stylers
are about to invade Harlem?

15:01.943 --> 15:06.531
I did. I used the dreaded phrase
that wakes up most politicians.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.324
Gang war.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.409
And?

15:10.326 --> 15:12.245
He gave us 50 extra unis.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.289
- You've got to be kidding me.
- That's the good news.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.793
The bad news is that we've got
48 hours to get this thing under control,

15:18.876 --> 15:22.213
or the governor's sending in
the National Guard... and ICE.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.841
They're gonna round up
every Jamaican on sight,

15:24.924 --> 15:25.925
innocent or implicated.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.386
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah. Our friend.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.222
He's your friend.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.182
Has he said hello to you today?

15:33.766 --> 15:37.270
That's what I thought. He doesn't need
to follow rules or a clock.

15:37.353 --> 15:41.107
Luke Cage works when he feels like it.
Harlem's Hero, my ass.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.277
Luke Cage is not the problem
or the target.

15:44.360 --> 15:49.157
Now, none of this is random,
and Mariah knows who and why.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.243
Hold on.
We need to talk about Cockroach first.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.120
How did you know where to go?

15:54.203 --> 15:57.957
I didn't. The heads hadn't turned up yet.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.668
I got to Cockroach's
around quarter to 10:00.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.044
Why'd you go there?

16:03.838 --> 16:06.674
I wanted to do a welfare check
on Drea Powell.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.969
Look, he had just put her
back in the hospital.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.680
- She said it was Cockroach?
- She didn't have to say it.

16:12.763 --> 16:13.890
It was in her eyes.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.185
That's right. Because eyes testify, right?

16:18.186 --> 16:21.189
So I got to the spot, went in,

16:21.272 --> 16:23.524
and that's when I found him
sitting on the couch,

16:23.608 --> 16:26.027
draped in blood with his head missing.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.571
I called it in. You know the rest.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.198
How'd you get inside?

16:30.740 --> 16:32.033
Was the door open?

16:34.368 --> 16:36.662
I picked the lock. Look, my gut...

16:36.746 --> 16:39.290
Your gut does not constitute
probable cause.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.541
What does it matter?

16:40.625 --> 16:42.919
We caught the body.
Let's work the case.

16:43.002 --> 16:46.255
You contaminated the investigation.
There's a file on my desk.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.841
Ben Donovan filed a complaint with IAB

16:48.925 --> 16:52.553
an hour after your chat
with Mr. Hamilton in his apartment.

16:52.637 --> 16:56.057
The same apartment that he
was beheaded in hours later.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.142
Harlem is a goddamn firecracker right now.

16:58.226 --> 17:01.479
And that is way more important
than me falling on my sword.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.232
Now, let me get in there
and talk to Mariah

17:04.315 --> 17:07.818
to get to the bottom of this
before shit escalates any further.

17:07.902 --> 17:12.031
Go home, Mercedes, until further notice.

17:32.385 --> 17:36.264
I been knowing Mariah since I was a kid.
My whole life, man.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.934
My mom was working for the Stokes.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.103
So when I started making noise
on Wall Street,

17:42.186 --> 17:44.063
she was one of the first people
to support me.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.275
You know, giving me clients,
downtown connections.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.987
- What did she want?
- Money.

17:51.654 --> 17:52.822
Real money.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.784
She wanted to know more
about offshore banking and stocks.

17:56.867 --> 18:00.955
The crooked legal ways white folk get down
when it comes to protecting their green.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.707
She's surprising.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.545
How so?

18:07.628 --> 18:12.508
She's bougier than Lawrence Otis Graham,
but with the tenacity of Frank Lucas.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.510
She's straight gully with her shit.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.803
That's the problem.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.682
It's what's coming
out of the gully after her.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.642
And you.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.583
I have been sitting here
for well over an hour.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.918
I am sorry, May May.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.129
In here, you're protected.
Out there, you're not.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.257
- May May? Oh, hell, no.
- Want something from Red Rooster?

18:54.342 --> 18:56.469
You're a witness. Relax.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.097
No one thinks you're responsible.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.644
That's always been your tell.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.145
Your smile.

19:08.230 --> 19:13.110
I am not that shy girl
you held hands with in the ninth grade.

19:13.194 --> 19:18.282
Ninth, tenth, and eleventh.
You don't remember?

19:18.824 --> 19:20.242
I never forget.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.747
And then there was Karla,
and that was that.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.375
It's been 30 years?

19:27.458 --> 19:30.670
Thirty-five. I'll give her your regards.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.588
I didn't send them.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.592
I'm not a suspect.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.427
I can go.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.638
You're free to go whenever you want.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.810
Sayonara, baby.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.149
- Misty.
- What?

19:52.233 --> 19:55.319
You can't be back here. Captain's got
paperwork for you to fill out.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.613
- Really, Donnie?
- Yeah.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.574
Fine.

20:05.871 --> 20:07.707
Before you leave, one question.

20:08.374 --> 20:13.212
About the same time those heads rolled,
five gunmen attacked a private party

20:13.295 --> 20:16.590
in an attempt to kidnap a man
I think you might be familiar with.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.556
Witnesses also put Luke Cage at the scene.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.809
People say he might have
rescued Raymond Jones.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.352
Might have? Or did?

20:28.978 --> 20:32.106
I don't know.
No one's seen either one of them since.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.277
We've got <i>narcotraficante</i> shit.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.446
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean-</i> type shit.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.824
And now it's in Harlem.
You remember the posses?

20:41.907 --> 20:45.453
This is the posses on steroids.
Talk to me, May May.

20:46.704 --> 20:47.788
What do you know?

20:52.251 --> 20:55.129
I want protection.
For me and my daughter.

20:55.212 --> 20:59.049
We'll protect you both. I promise.
But I'm gonna need your help.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.014
The heads.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.308
Did you know any of them?

21:09.226 --> 21:12.062
Mark Higgins.
He was at my fundraiser last week.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.398
What about Andre Jackson?

21:14.482 --> 21:18.277
Yes, that's Ray Ray.
He worked at the Paradise.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.821
- Did you know he had a record?
- Uh, yeah.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.866
It's better to give a con a chance.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.786
Turn him away, he got to rob you.

21:28.162 --> 21:33.250
Dontrell Hamilton,
ran a down-low gambling operation.

21:33.334 --> 21:36.629
This was taken in Harlem's Paradise
less than a week ago.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.923
I don't work the door.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.550
Nope.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.093
Nope.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.263
What can I say?
Players wanna play.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.308
We are the most exciting club in the city.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.976
Then it's game over.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.772
Now they're all dead.
We know about your gun deal.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.856
My gun deal?

21:55.940 --> 21:57.691
You can't hide that from me.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.444
You think your cousin
prepared you for this?

22:00.528 --> 22:05.616
Cornell shot people, beat people to death.
He threw cats off of rooftops,

22:05.699 --> 22:09.161
but he always got rid of the bodies,
and you know why?

22:09.245 --> 22:10.788
Because he feared the law.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.542
Those Stylers don't fear a thing.

22:15.292 --> 22:20.631
May May, if you don't cooperate with us,
I can't protect you.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.026
I'll be fine.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.993
It's good to see you, Tommy.

23:00.504 --> 23:04.633
Man, the British press ain't no joke.
They don't even censor this shit.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.719
How'd you rig the game for Mariah?

23:07.261 --> 23:10.180
I just gave her some inside information.
What's wrong with that?

23:11.265 --> 23:12.558
It's illegal.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.477
Well, it shouldn't be.
I mean, everybody does it.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.104
Why they give you
the weather conditions

23:17.187 --> 23:19.440
before a football game?
Give you the injury report?

23:19.523 --> 23:21.358
Let you know when a coach is
about to be fired?

23:21.442 --> 23:23.652
So people can make
intelligent decisions on their bets.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.447
- That's all the information is for.
- Sit down.

23:27.114 --> 23:30.242
We took the gun-sale cash
and bought a whole lot of stock,

23:30.326 --> 23:34.038
'cause I knew that Glenn Industries
was gonna buy the company.

23:34.121 --> 23:35.956
Which would take their investment
and make it...

23:36.040 --> 23:37.041
Ten times more.

23:37.124 --> 23:40.252
Like when 50 had a piece of Vitaminwater
before Coca-Cola bought it.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.670
Exactly, my brother.

23:42.296 --> 23:45.382
Only problem was the chairman of Atreus
wanted to scuttle the sale.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.802
But Mariah found a way.

23:48.886 --> 23:49.887
Yep.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.640
Wait, wait, wait. Damn.

23:52.723 --> 23:54.892
That's what she does.

23:55.684 --> 23:58.395
Yeah, well...
So the vote sailed through, and bam.

23:58.479 --> 24:02.524
Black Mariah Trump.
Fair, square, legal, untouchable.

24:02.608 --> 24:06.528
That still doesn't explain why
Bushmaster and the Stylers want you.

24:07.488 --> 24:10.157
Are they mad at you because you made
Mariah all that money?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.409
Is that why they put
Mark Higgins' head on a stick?

24:12.993 --> 24:15.079
I do more than just manage money, brother.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.665
I offer a whole suite
of high-end services.

24:17.748 --> 24:20.918
Everything from bespoke analytics
and business intelligence,

24:21.001 --> 24:24.463
to temporary power of attorney over assets
to prevent asset seizure.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.882
- I mean, a piranha.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:26.965 --> 24:30.177
You have power of attorney
over Mariah's funds?

24:30.260 --> 24:33.555
Yeah, and the club, too.
Temporarily, I mean. So what?

24:34.682 --> 24:38.811
So whoever controls you,
controls Mariah and Shades.

24:41.814 --> 24:45.192
All right, look, bruh. I did everything
you said. I told you everything I know.

24:45.275 --> 24:48.987
Just get me to my private jet, so I can
get you paid and get the hell outta here.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.155
This is...

24:52.116 --> 24:53.117
Nope.

24:53.909 --> 24:54.910
What?

24:55.494 --> 24:59.248
You're too valuable.
You're the Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

24:59.873 --> 25:03.544
You're a living, breathing, one-man
Crispus Attucks ghetto stash house.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.213
The best bargaining chip ever.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.885
I guess we're just gonna
hunker down for the night.

25:11.969 --> 25:15.764
And tomorrow morning,
I'm gonna get you to the cops.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.142
The morning?

25:18.559 --> 25:22.438
You know, you really suck at this whole
"for hire" thing. You realize that, right?

25:22.521 --> 25:25.524
I mean,
just no professional ethics at all.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.942
Just... Just ghetto.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.486
Support black business, brother.

25:31.071 --> 25:34.158
Shoot. You bulletproof. I'm ghetto-proof.
That's some bullshit.

25:34.241 --> 25:36.160
What's up, D.W.?

25:36.243 --> 25:38.787
I heard about
that wild-ass Ghostface party.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.832
I know it's some honeys up in there
looking all exotical and shit.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.418
<i>I could've used some footage.
You home yet?</i>

25:44.501 --> 25:46.086
No. Why?

25:46.670 --> 25:50.090
I saw two cats walking into the barbershop
through the back door.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.509
They didn't look like friends of yours.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.685
Ooh!

27:26.270 --> 27:28.564
I have not been here in a minute.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.066
Yeah, it's all come full circle.

27:31.149 --> 27:34.361
And now that the Lenox Lounge
is gonna be a Sephora,

27:34.444 --> 27:36.989
old Harlem suddenly feels new.

27:37.072 --> 27:40.576
I remember
when this place was a weed spot.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.912
Streets are hot again.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.498
And you're right at the center, as usual.

27:46.582 --> 27:49.042
But why, is the question.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.546
Three-quarter tax-free pension.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.132
I'd give my right arm
for that kind of package.

27:58.510 --> 28:03.098
You know, you don't sugarcoat shit,
and I appreciate that about you.

28:03.181 --> 28:06.602
You know, I should tell you, I don't
consult for the department anymore,

28:06.685 --> 28:11.815
so whatever you say to me tonight or
moving forward is completely confidential.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.151
Okay.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.364
I...

28:21.033 --> 28:22.701
was about to...

28:24.244 --> 28:27.623
plant evidence on a guilty suspect.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.710
But I discovered his body instead.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.964
Well, that's one way to go about the job.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.550
I'm about to get fired.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.054
You probably should.

28:44.556 --> 28:48.685
You don't think it's ever okay to do
the wrong thing for the right reason?

28:48.769 --> 28:50.187
Life is funny like that.

28:50.270 --> 28:56.068
If you get bit by a snake,
paramedic poisons you again to cure you.

28:57.945 --> 29:01.198
And God help you
if you have a bad reaction,

29:01.281 --> 29:04.201
because, at that point,
you'll wish you were dead.

29:05.035 --> 29:06.078
Believe me.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.248
What?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.125
There is no right answer.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.711
Nobody gets a time machine.

29:16.546 --> 29:19.424
Now, you need to figure out
how to fix this.

29:20.092 --> 29:24.763
You gotta be honest with yourself
about who you are right now.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.684
Not the you
that everybody wants you to be.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.602
And you're gonna have to dig deep.

29:30.686 --> 29:34.856
You're gonna have to go inside
the basement of your psyche,

29:34.940 --> 29:37.109
and dust things off...

29:38.694 --> 29:42.281
and think about what's real.

29:44.658 --> 29:47.452
Otherwise, it'll eat away at you.

29:49.079 --> 29:51.290
And then who knows who you'll become?

30:00.299 --> 30:03.427
Auntie, go home. We'll finish here.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.262
My good, good nephew.

30:06.513 --> 30:07.889
- Love you.
- Love you.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.893
Babes, don't tarry.

30:16.398 --> 30:19.693
Another man would've lost his head
for the disrespect you showed tonight.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.029
Do not talk to me like that.

30:22.112 --> 30:26.450
The day I'm scared to speak my mind,
Lord strike me dead. Even you.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.536
Come on. Let's reason, you know.

30:30.912 --> 30:34.791
I didn't save your life and help raise you
for you to do the things you did tonight.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.085
You know damn well why it's so.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.589
The Stokes family,
they took everything from us.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.050
Mariah must burn!

30:43.717 --> 30:46.803
Then kill her. I can't argue that.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.891
But this terrorism makes
our people look bad.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.225
I don't care how we look.

30:52.309 --> 30:55.937
You don't understand
our people's position in this country?

30:57.606 --> 30:59.733
We come here with nothing,

31:01.234 --> 31:04.112
and build everything up from scratch.

31:06.365 --> 31:10.702
Restaurants, car services, nursing,

31:10.786 --> 31:13.914
tax preparation, engineering.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.999
We stress education,

31:16.875 --> 31:19.002
and we work hard.

31:21.922 --> 31:24.049
You want people to be sent back?

31:24.132 --> 31:28.387
You want to make our people look so savage
that this country turns on us?

31:28.470 --> 31:32.641
Come on.
This country already turned on us.

31:33.809 --> 31:34.810
It began with the Stokes.

31:34.893 --> 31:39.147
People think they can do whatever
they want with no consequence. No.

31:39.231 --> 31:43.485
Then finish it with dignity,
not suffering.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.532
An eye for an eye
makes the whole world blind.

31:49.074 --> 31:52.202
The past is gone. You can't change it.

31:52.285 --> 31:55.455
All you can do is build something
for the next generation.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.877
You're family.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.422
I love you.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.508
But you must find peace in your heart.

32:14.808 --> 32:16.226
I say war.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.760
I make it
all the way out of Seagate

32:50.844 --> 32:54.139
just to get whacked over some beef
I ain't even cook.

32:58.226 --> 32:59.936
That's some funny shit.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.357
Stubborn old bitch.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.904
Mariah hasn't been in this game
as long as us.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.655
She couldn't see what I saw.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.991
Then why is she the one
running things and not you?

33:13.533 --> 33:14.993
'Cause you ain't seen what I seen.

33:15.076 --> 33:19.498
When Luke Cage showed up,
Cottonmouth mentally unraveled.

33:20.749 --> 33:24.211
I saw him beat this dude to death
with his bare hands.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.631
He was becoming increasingly reckless.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.927
I was never shook, but he was a problem.

33:32.969 --> 33:38.099
That stubborn old bitch pushed him
right through that circular window

33:38.642 --> 33:41.394
and then finished his ass off
with a mic stand.

33:41.478 --> 33:43.813
She fixed the problem.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.067
You saw her do it?

33:47.776 --> 33:51.238
I was on my way there that night
to kill his ass myself.

33:51.321 --> 33:52.781
She beat me to it.

33:54.783 --> 33:57.494
She has ice in her veins, kid.

33:58.203 --> 34:02.207
And I'm telling you, when it comes time
to deal with the Stylers,

34:02.290 --> 34:03.833
she will not hesitate.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.632
Who else knows
she really killed Cottonmouth?

34:13.592 --> 34:14.678
Just you.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.014
I can't trust anybody else.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.107
I don't get you, B.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.570
What's not to understand?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.822
Cottonmouth, Diamondback...

34:35.782 --> 34:37.367
They knew what I know.

34:37.951 --> 34:39.536
You're a born leader.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.620
Brilliant.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.708
But you finally got a chance
to be in control and take charge,

34:45.792 --> 34:48.253
and you riding for someone
who doesn't deserve the crown.

34:48.335 --> 34:50.088
You should take that shit from her.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.216
What's your plan?

34:58.054 --> 34:59.681
To live the American dream.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.437
I got a loaded gun, a hard dick
and a pocket full of cash.

35:06.730 --> 35:09.608
That's the American dream. Right?

35:09.691 --> 35:12.360
There's more than this shit,
and you know it.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.237
Thousand-dollar suits,

35:14.904 --> 35:17.449
bitches, champagne...

35:18.491 --> 35:19.826
All that shit is cute,

35:21.286 --> 35:26.207
but when you have to kill to get it,
you're gonna get killed if you keep it.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.417
That's karma.

35:29.169 --> 35:30.420
That's the life.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.006
We do what we do.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.008
But there's a better way,

35:35.884 --> 35:37.093
a bigger life...

35:38.261 --> 35:41.264
one where you don't have to look
over your shoulder every second.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.433
Mariah's taught me that.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.438
You're just out of prison,
but you still have that mentality.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.982
You gotta forget all that shit.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.985
We don't have to be just gangsters.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.157
We could be so much more than that.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.081
We are more than that.

36:08.541 --> 36:10.502
Or did you forget that shit, too?

36:23.056 --> 36:24.516
Inside was inside.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.146
Lack of human interaction.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.483
Lack of trust.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.823
We did what we had to do
to keep from going crazy.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.411
We didn't have to do shit.

36:46.496 --> 36:47.539
I wanted to.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.126
You did, too.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.006
Life inside is inside.

36:58.842 --> 37:00.719
Prison has its own set of rules

37:01.219 --> 37:05.598
that no one in the outside world
would ever understand.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.144
We're out now.

37:10.895 --> 37:11.980
It's different.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.276
I'm different. We're different.

37:17.610 --> 37:18.778
I ain't different.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.700
Inside, outside...

37:27.078 --> 37:28.872
I am who I am, B.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.250
- What do you want me to say?
- Come on, man.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.838
Cats out here getting their heads cut off.

37:38.423 --> 37:40.550
Maybe we survive. Maybe we don't.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.388
I'm just saying how I feel.

37:52.896 --> 37:54.397
I would die for you, Che.

37:57.650 --> 37:59.110
That'll never change.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.072
But it is what it is.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.003
We need to find Lucas.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.672
We're wasting our time here.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.434
No time is ever really wasted.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.231
Time reveals all.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.470
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

39:07.554 --> 39:09.472
<i>to an automated voice messaging system.</i>

39:09.556 --> 39:11.182
Tilda.

39:12.767 --> 39:15.436
You can't just ghost me like that.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.355
Call me.

39:18.648 --> 39:19.774
Please.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.111
You call me.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.700
<i>It's me. Do you.</i>

39:28.783 --> 39:30.451
God! Hernan!

39:30.535 --> 39:32.412
I didn't mean to disturb you.

39:32.996 --> 39:35.081
Come in. Stay.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.838
Pour me a drink, please.

39:44.007 --> 39:45.717
Pour yourself a drink, too.

40:01.524 --> 40:05.528
To trust and love.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.405
Screw 'em both.

40:12.869 --> 40:14.621
Everyone I ever loved...

40:16.289 --> 40:17.540
has betrayed me.

40:19.876 --> 40:20.835
Mama Mabel.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.838
Uncle Pete.

40:26.466 --> 40:27.717
Cornell.

40:29.260 --> 40:32.055
Now... Tilda.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.266
- You don't mean that.
- Oh!

40:36.017 --> 40:39.437
When I really needed them,
where they been?

40:40.229 --> 40:42.398
I'm sure Shades is...

40:42.482 --> 40:47.528
Don't even
get me started on Shades.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.825
Yeah, bad-ass bitch.

40:57.080 --> 41:00.959
If it weren't for Luke Cage, Piranha...

41:03.878 --> 41:06.923
and everything I own would be long gone.

41:12.679 --> 41:19.018
<i>My sworn enemy is the only one I can trust</i>

41:19.102 --> 41:23.982
<i>to protect everything
I've got left in this world.</i>

41:29.570 --> 41:30.738
Hey. Over there.

41:30.822 --> 41:31.823
Pull over.

41:36.452 --> 41:39.288
They could be in there.
Call Sheldon.

41:47.046 --> 41:48.047
Can I use your phone?

41:50.216 --> 41:51.217
Nope.

41:51.509 --> 41:55.722
Oh, come on, brother.
Look, I got people that I care about...

41:56.431 --> 41:58.182
who are probably worried about me.
Don't you?

41:58.266 --> 41:59.976
Man, stop trying to bond with me.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.811
You know, I'm fueled by failure.

42:03.229 --> 42:05.773
See, my mother was one
of Mama Mabel's hoes.

42:06.816 --> 42:09.569
- Her best one.
- You sound proud of that.

42:09.652 --> 42:10.987
Desiree.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.742
One of her regulars was a banker.

42:16.784 --> 42:20.038
He's big-time. You know.
He promised to get her out the life.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.874
He fell in love with her hard.

42:22.957 --> 42:26.002
But that was bullshit,
because he wasn't gonna leave his wife.

42:26.836 --> 42:30.882
So my mom just had me,
and he stopped calling.

42:32.717 --> 42:37.346
In fact, you know that book on my desk?
<i>Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun?</i>

42:38.097 --> 42:39.724
Yeah, that was his.

42:40.975 --> 42:43.061
He left it behind in her room.

42:44.062 --> 42:49.776
You know, I went to see him
after I graduated City College...

42:52.487 --> 42:55.782
and he had me escorted out his office.

42:56.866 --> 43:00.369
I made <i>Forbes </i>"30 Under 30,"

43:00.453 --> 43:03.748
and he lost everything
in the mortgage crisis.

43:05.458 --> 43:08.461
But guess who showed up
with their hands out?

43:10.254 --> 43:12.131
I told that bastard he could take a hike.

43:14.258 --> 43:15.968
I know that must've felt good.

43:16.052 --> 43:18.721
Aw, that shit felt great. In the moment...

43:19.472 --> 43:21.474
even though I never saw him again.

43:25.812 --> 43:27.730
I'll tell you what's better than great:

43:30.441 --> 43:32.360
paying all my mom's bills,

43:33.653 --> 43:35.822
you know, calling her at least once a day.

43:38.074 --> 43:39.492
I'm my own father.

43:45.498 --> 43:48.376
Your father was a reverend, right?
He was a preacher.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.753
What's his name? Reverend what?

43:52.130 --> 43:53.214
Reverend Nunya.

43:53.297 --> 43:54.632
That Swahili?

43:54.715 --> 43:55.967
You could say that.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.719
You really don't like me asking
about your daddy, huh?

43:58.803 --> 44:01.139
- What happened?
- Nunya business, man.

44:02.306 --> 44:03.432
Is he in your life?

44:04.809 --> 44:07.228
Not exactly. Are we done?

44:09.272 --> 44:10.273
Why not?

44:13.651 --> 44:16.154
Because when I went to prison,
he didn't believe I was innocent.

44:16.237 --> 44:18.948
And when I got out,
I didn't need him. Okay?

44:20.158 --> 44:21.159
I get it.

44:21.242 --> 44:23.411
I don't need you to get it.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.579
Well, I do.

44:24.662 --> 44:29.041
I also get why you keep running around
town, trying to save everybody else.

44:30.168 --> 44:31.919
You're just running from yourself.

44:35.298 --> 44:37.133
You need to go see your daddy.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.308
I think I know what I gotta do.

44:48.436 --> 44:49.437
Really?

44:51.272 --> 44:52.273
What's that?

44:55.693 --> 44:57.570
I gotta take you to the cops.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.918
Luke, where are you?

45:12.001 --> 45:15.838
<i>I'm holed up in a theater with Piranha.
He's the key to this whole thing.</i>

45:15.922 --> 45:18.925
<i>He can bring down Mariah, Shades,
even Bushmaster.</i>

45:19.008 --> 45:20.509
He's got control over her money.

45:20.593 --> 45:22.970
He can speak to her money laundering
and insider trading.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.263
That's federal time.

45:24.847 --> 45:27.516
Give me an address.
I'll come to you.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.851
No, you'll expose us.

45:28.935 --> 45:31.270
Bushmaster's got gypsy cabs
patrolling the neighborhood.

45:35.107 --> 45:37.902
Are there any distinguishing marks
on the cabs?

45:37.985 --> 45:40.196
<i>Yeah, they got some kind of logo
on the door,</i>

45:40.279 --> 45:41.489
<i>Jamaican colors:</i>

45:41.572 --> 45:43.658
<i>black, gold, green...</i>

45:44.367 --> 45:45.826
<i>with a hint of red.</i>

45:45.910 --> 45:46.911
Bingo.

45:47.495 --> 45:50.164
I just spotted one
right outside the precinct.

45:54.293 --> 45:55.294
Shit!

45:56.170 --> 45:57.338
He took off.

45:57.421 --> 46:00.341
But I got the license plate
and I clocked the logo.

46:00.424 --> 46:01.968
<i>His ass is mine now.</i>

46:14.689 --> 46:17.191
Piranha, it's not funny. Where you at?

46:19.902 --> 46:21.696
Hurry, before he finds us.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.657
Ah, shit!

46:24.740 --> 46:26.701
I got to call home, damn it!

46:26.784 --> 46:29.620
- Wait!
- Get him down there, and shut him up.

46:29.704 --> 46:32.081
Luke! Luke!

46:32.164 --> 46:34.667
- Shit.
- Help, Luke! Help!

46:35.293 --> 46:37.086
Help!

46:45.219 --> 46:46.470
Piranha!

47:07.158 --> 47:08.492
Run! Run!

47:08.576 --> 47:09.618
Come this way!

47:15.958 --> 47:16.834
Enough!

47:29.930 --> 47:31.557
Go, go, go!

47:32.141 --> 47:33.934
Get him up!

48:18.229 --> 48:19.230
You okay?

48:21.482 --> 48:23.651
That shit was dope!

48:24.193 --> 48:26.779
Come on, let's go.
I'll get you someplace safe.

48:30.616 --> 48:31.951
God damn!

48:33.327 --> 48:35.121
God damn...

48:43.963 --> 48:45.589
I gave you one job.

48:45.673 --> 48:49.677
You don't give me jobs.
We're either partners or we're not.

48:50.761 --> 48:55.433
It's gone. Everything. Everything is gone.

48:55.516 --> 48:57.726
- We'll get it back.
- Oh, God.

48:58.310 --> 48:59.645
My dream, just...

49:00.688 --> 49:07.194
All of the handshaking,
all the baby-and ass-kissing,

49:07.278 --> 49:13.325
every campaign I ever waged
was about my dream for this community.

49:14.243 --> 49:15.786
Family First!

49:17.746 --> 49:21.959
I swore I would take
that hard-ass woman's mantra

49:22.042 --> 49:26.630
and just make it into
something good and beautiful,

49:26.714 --> 49:32.344
and it would wash away all of the violence
and the murder and the hurt.

49:32.428 --> 49:35.806
Wash it away,
and now the dream has exploded.

49:35.890 --> 49:38.184
- Doesn't have to.
- No, don't...

49:39.059 --> 49:41.103
Go ahead and say it! Say it!

49:41.187 --> 49:46.734
You warned me about Bushmaster,
but I was so greedy I couldn't hear it.

49:46.817 --> 49:51.113
I sold my Harlem to a crazed bush nigga.

49:51.197 --> 49:53.574
This whole shitshow is because of me.

49:53.657 --> 49:55.159
What's done is done.

49:56.744 --> 50:00.706
It's time now to take care of our enemies.
Do you hear me?

50:08.923 --> 50:10.132
I'm listening.

50:11.467 --> 50:16.305
The night after you closed the gun deal,
I followed Bushmaster back to Brooklyn.

50:16.388 --> 50:17.765
Wasn't easy.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.350
He's paranoid as hell.

50:20.017 --> 50:21.852
And I found his go-to spot.

50:23.354 --> 50:25.689
A Jamaican restaurant called Gwen's.

50:25.773 --> 50:27.149
He has friends there.

50:29.526 --> 50:30.861
Maybe even family.

50:40.829 --> 50:41.830
Good.

50:45.251 --> 50:46.252
Good.

50:47.586 --> 50:48.963
What do you want to do?

50:50.673 --> 50:53.008
Wait till we get Piranha back.

50:54.510 --> 50:55.511
And then?

50:59.056 --> 51:00.266
Uh-huh.

51:12.027 --> 51:14.071
May I ask you a question?

51:14.154 --> 51:17.408
<i>Who else knew about what happened to Tone?</i>

51:30.379 --> 51:32.089
Besides Turk and Cornell?

51:33.966 --> 51:34.967
Nobody.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.179
What about Spurlock?

51:40.055 --> 51:41.890
He just burned the body.

51:44.143 --> 51:45.311
That's all?

51:46.103 --> 51:48.230
No one else knows?

51:54.194 --> 51:55.237
Nobody else.

51:57.823 --> 51:58.657
Why?

51:59.908 --> 52:01.493
Just wondering.

52:35.944 --> 52:38.364
That's what I was doing
at Cockroach's apartment.

52:39.031 --> 52:40.866
I went there to plant evidence.

52:41.575 --> 52:46.372
The son of a bitch was suing Luke,
he beat the shit out of Drea,

52:46.455 --> 52:48.332
and I wanted payback.

52:52.002 --> 52:53.003
Okay.

52:54.213 --> 52:55.547
I can work with that.

52:57.299 --> 52:58.592
Work with it?

52:59.134 --> 53:01.136
I almost framed a man.

53:01.220 --> 53:03.931
- But you didn't.
- Because he was already dead.

53:04.014 --> 53:06.683
The fact that you're in here confessing
speaks volumes.

53:06.767 --> 53:07.726
So, that's it?

53:08.352 --> 53:12.439
I get a stern talking to, and then
I go back out there and do the job?

53:12.523 --> 53:15.818
No, you have to live with what you did.

53:15.901 --> 53:17.194
What if I can't?

53:17.277 --> 53:21.073
In case you haven't noticed,
there's a war raging in our streets.

53:21.156 --> 53:22.491
Yeah, I've noticed the war.

53:22.574 --> 53:25.452
It's the same one
that we have been fighting for years,

53:25.536 --> 53:27.454
and shit doesn't change.

53:27.538 --> 53:32.626
But the rules of engagement do,
and if I do it your way, nothing happens.

53:32.709 --> 53:34.002
Zilch.

53:34.920 --> 53:37.423
And the other way, I become Scarfe.

53:38.799 --> 53:40.801
And I cannot become Scarfe.

53:43.637 --> 53:46.765
- I'm not worried you will.
- Yeah, well, you're not me.

53:51.770 --> 53:52.980
Misty, don't.

53:54.398 --> 53:55.399
I can't accept that.

53:55.482 --> 53:56.733
I'm done.

53:58.360 --> 54:03.073
I will turn in my paperwork tomorrow.
I'm... I'm sorry, Captain. I really am.

54:15.169 --> 54:18.464
How long
are we supposed to sit here?

54:31.477 --> 54:33.061
Well, it's about time.

54:39.568 --> 54:40.777
I can't stay.

54:42.821 --> 54:44.448
But I need your help.

54:44.531 --> 54:45.532
Anything.

54:48.410 --> 54:49.828
This is Raymond Jones.

54:50.996 --> 54:52.498
He needs a place to hide.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.666
Friends call me Piranha.

54:55.876 --> 54:59.755
It's a honor to meet the reverend
behind the big man.

54:59.838 --> 55:03.342
So, tell me, how was he as a kid?
Was he always this strong?

55:05.135 --> 55:09.097
Mr. Jones, if you wouldn't mind,
could you just give us a moment, please?

55:09.181 --> 55:12.017
- Oh, yeah. Go 'head. Do you. Do you.
- Thank you.

55:14.645 --> 55:15.812
What's going on?

55:19.816 --> 55:22.694
Piranha's in trouble.
I'm trying to get him out of it.

55:23.403 --> 55:28.075
Does this have anything to do with all
that craziness last night at that party?

55:28.659 --> 55:30.827
Or with the heads on pikes?

55:33.247 --> 55:35.958
Look, I'll tell you everything
when I get back.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.878
But for now, can he stay?

55:41.588 --> 55:45.342
The church is a sanctuary.
Of course he's welcome.

55:46.510 --> 55:47.511
And...

55:48.053 --> 55:49.346
so are you.

55:54.184 --> 55:56.853
Just make sure he doesn't leave, okay?

56:01.692 --> 56:04.570
And you stay off the streets, too.
It's not safe.

56:04.653 --> 56:06.154
Is it safe for you?

56:09.783 --> 56:10.784
Hey!

56:11.910 --> 56:15.998
If I'm not back in an hour,
you call Mercedes Knight at the Harlem PD.

56:16.081 --> 56:17.332
She'll protect you.

56:17.416 --> 56:19.251
And what are you gonna do?

56:23.297 --> 56:24.464
What I do.

56:51.825 --> 56:54.453
What's the word? You find them?

56:54.536 --> 56:55.537
<i>No, they haven't.</i>

56:56.246 --> 56:57.581
<i>And they won't.</i>

56:57.664 --> 57:00.751
<i>I've got something you want.
Piranha Jones.</i>

57:00.834 --> 57:02.669
And what you want in return?

57:02.753 --> 57:05.130
A good old-fashioned showdown.

57:05.672 --> 57:07.507
You and me. Today.

57:07.591 --> 57:11.178
<i>No weapons. No sneak attacks.
A fair fight.</i>

57:11.261 --> 57:14.056
If you win, you get Piranha.

57:14.139 --> 57:18.185
If I win, you leave him and Harlem alone.

57:19.811 --> 57:20.812
Where?

57:20.896 --> 57:23.690
High Bridge. Let's say...

57:23.774 --> 57:27.444
High noon. I love those cowboy movies.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.252
Luke Cage!

57:45.253 --> 57:46.713
John McIver.

57:47.422 --> 57:48.882
Born in Brooklyn.

57:48.966 --> 57:50.592
Raised in Kingston.

57:50.676 --> 57:52.761
Murdered your way
to the top of the Stylers.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.554
Now you're in Harlem.

57:54.638 --> 57:57.224
You wanna write my life story?

57:57.307 --> 57:59.518
No, but I might edit it.

57:59.601 --> 58:01.269
You braggadocious?

58:02.354 --> 58:04.398
I've fought gangsters with powers,

58:04.481 --> 58:07.734
maniacs looking for cheap revenge
and immortality.

58:07.818 --> 58:09.111
Is that you?

58:09.194 --> 58:11.863
I'm not interested in anything cheap.

58:11.947 --> 58:13.490
Revenge is expensive.

58:13.573 --> 58:14.574
So that's it?

58:15.158 --> 58:19.037
This war for Harlem
is about revenge against Mariah?

58:19.955 --> 58:20.956
Why?

58:24.626 --> 58:25.627
History.

58:26.503 --> 58:27.504
Destiny.

58:28.422 --> 58:30.882
You can't fight with the ancestors.

58:30.966 --> 58:35.178
- Don't you wanna live your own life?
- And do what? Hmm?

58:35.262 --> 58:39.141
Get a job? Love a woman? Raise children?

58:39.224 --> 58:42.644
- Sounds good to me.
- Is that your life?

58:42.728 --> 58:46.106
No. Not while I have to deal
with people like you.

58:48.608 --> 58:51.528
You have power. I have power.

58:51.611 --> 58:56.867
Why fight one another when we could join
together and take it from Mariah? Hmm?

58:56.950 --> 58:59.077
Because you're a homicidal criminal.

58:59.995 --> 59:03.373
And, for better or worse,
I'm Harlem's Hero.

59:03.457 --> 59:05.292
You talk too much to be a hero.

59:05.876 --> 59:06.877
Heroes do.

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:38.802
You're done.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:40.720
Give up.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:02.951
Can't... move.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:08.123
You're paralyzed.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:13.295
There are things that come from the earth,
power you won't understand.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:17.382
Respect.

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:23.054
Under different circumstances,
we could have been friends.
