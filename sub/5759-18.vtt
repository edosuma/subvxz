WEBVTT

00:01.300 --> 00:03.268
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'ITLE LIARS...

00:03.300 --> 00:04.392
THE PERFECT HIDEAWAY.

00:04.430 --> 00:05.727
AN EMPTY BED AND BREAKFAST.

00:05.770 --> 00:07.431
I THINK WE SHOULD
GO CHECK IT OUT.

00:07.470 --> 00:08.437
YOU STOPPING?

00:08.470 --> 00:10.165
NO, I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.336
THE ENGINE STOPPED WORKING.

00:11.370 --> 00:12.530
MAGGIE IS TRYING
TO PREVENT ME

00:12.580 --> 00:13.569
FROM SEEING MALCOLM.

00:13.610 --> 00:15.271
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WANTED THAT.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.170
SORRY.

00:18.210 --> 00:19.711
MAYBE WE SHOULD GIVE THIS
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

00:19.750 --> 00:20.546
I'M OFFICER HOLBROOK.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.548
MY PARTNER AND I
ARE INVESTIGATING

00:22.590 --> 00:25.343
THE MURDERS OF OFFICER REYNOLDS
AND DETECTIVE WILDEN.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.688
YOU CAN HAVE THIS PLACE.
IT COULD BE OUR SECRET.

00:28.760 --> 00:29.784
I TOOK PICTURES
OF SOME OF THE STORIES

00:29.830 --> 00:31.718
IN ALI'S JOURNAL
BEFORE "A" GOT IT.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.228
ALI WANTS TO MEET ME TONIGHT.
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING ALONE.

00:34.260 --> 00:35.625
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
SHE'LL MEET ME.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.662
DID YOU TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS?

00:37.700 --> 00:39.361
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FOLLOWED ME HERE.

00:39.400 --> 00:41.095
SHE CAN TRUST YOU
BUT NOT THE REST OF US?

00:41.140 --> 00:42.664
SHE'S TRYING TO DIVIDE US.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.632
YOU'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB
OF THAT ALL ON YOUR OWN.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.672
I'M SORRY.
DON'T!

00:48.380 --> 00:49.745
WELL, I MISSED, LIKE,
HALF THE MOVIE.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.338
THAT DUDE THAT WAS
SITTING IN FRONT OF US

00:51.380 --> 00:52.472
KEPT MAKING SALES CALLS.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.738
SALES CALLS? I THOUGHT HE WAS
BREAKING UP WITH SOMEBODY.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.611
HE WAS. HIS CAR.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.083
I SWEAR,
IF SPENCER WAS THERE,

00:58.120 --> 01:00.111
SHE WOULD'VE PEGGED HIM
WITH HER JELLY BEANS.

01:02.390 --> 01:04.358
( sighs ) OKAY, I'M SORRY.

01:04.390 --> 01:06.358
BUT SERIOUSLY.
YOU CANNOT HOLD ONTO THIS.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.493
SPENCER WAS JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

01:08.530 --> 01:10.498
NO, SHE WAS TRYING
TO CONTROL THE SITUATION.

01:10.530 --> 01:11.622
LIKE SHE ALWAYS DOES.

01:11.670 --> 01:15.094
EMILY, LOOK, SHE THOUGHT
THAT YOU WERE MAKING A MISTAKE.

01:15.140 --> 01:16.835
I DID. BY TRUSTING HER.

01:16.870 --> 01:19.304
EM...
NO, I WAS THIS CLOSE

01:19.340 --> 01:21.433
TO FINDING OUT FROM ALISON
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT
SHE DISAPPEARED.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.277
AND NOW WE'LL NEVER
HEAR FROM HER AGAIN.

01:23.310 --> 01:27.747
( loud voices )

01:27.780 --> 01:31.819
u u u **
( Indlstlnct chatter )

01:34.660 --> 01:36.628
MIKE?

01:36.660 --> 01:38.321
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

01:38.360 --> 01:40.191
DAD SAID I COULD HAVE
A FEW FRIENDS OVER.

01:40.230 --> 01:41.720
THIS IS NOT A "FEW FRIENDS."

01:41.760 --> 01:42.863
( turns off music )

01:42.900 --> 01:44.822
ARIA, CHILL.
NO, I'M NOT "CHILLIN'"!

01:44.870 --> 01:46.292
DAD LEFI' ME
IN CHARGE FOR THE WEEKEND,

01:46.340 --> 01:49.867
AND I DON'T WANNA SPEND
THE NEXT TWO DAYS PEELING
PEPPERONI OFF THE WALLS.

01:51.710 --> 01:53.405
UH, HELLO?

01:53.440 --> 01:55.601
THIS IS SOMEBODY'S DESK.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.744
MOVE IT!

01:57.780 --> 02:00.248
OKAY, PEOPLE ARE STILL EATING.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.339
WELL, TELL THEM IT'S TAKE-OUT.
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS, OKAY?

02:02.390 --> 02:04.881
YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES TO CLEAR
ALL THIS PEOPLE OUT OF HERE.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.353
ALL RIGHT?

02:06.390 --> 02:08.187
COME ON, EM.

02:21.640 --> 02:24.336
( dialing )

02:24.370 --> 02:29.376
( ringing )

02:30.810 --> 02:32.471
YEAH?

02:32.520 --> 02:34.772
HEY, IN ALI'S STORY ABOUT
HER DATE WITH AN OLDER GUY,

02:34.820 --> 02:39.280
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT
"NOVELS AND TRAVEL"
OR "SHOVELS AND GRAVEL"?

02:39.320 --> 02:40.389
UH-HUH.

02:40.420 --> 02:41.956
I'M TRYING TO PIECE
THIS TOGETHER.

02:41.990 --> 02:43.548
HER HANDWRITING IS SO SLOPPY.

02:43.590 --> 02:46.388
IT'S LIKE DOING MAD LIBS
IN REVERSE.

02:46.430 --> 02:49.263
BUT ALI ON A DATE
WITH A MYSTERY DUDE,
IT SEEMS KIND OF IMPORTANT.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.758
OKAY, WELL, THE "MYSTERY DUDE"
WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON
IS PA'I'I'ERSON.

02:52.800 --> 02:57.737
PATTERSON? ISN'T THAT
THAT KID IN WORLD HISTORY WHO'S
ALWAYS SNIFFING HIS FINGERS?

02:57.770 --> 03:00.603
NO, JAMES PATTERSON,
THE AUTHOR.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.940
THIS GUY JUST GETS
THE CRIMINAL MIND.

03:04.980 --> 03:08.973
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
WHEN WERE YOU INTERESTED
IN ANYBODY BORN BEFORE 1989?

03:09.020 --> 03:09.782
THINK ABOUT IT.

03:09.820 --> 03:11.583
THE PERSON
WHO TRIED TO KILL ALISON

03:11.620 --> 03:12.985
DUMPED SOME RANDOM
INTO A HOLE

03:13.020 --> 03:14.783
AND TRIED TO MAKE HER
LOOK LIKE ALI.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.959
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T REFER
TO THE DEAD GIRL AS A "RANDOM."

03:16.990 --> 03:19.424
LOOK, IF WE FOLLOW
THE TRAIL OF "A's" COVER-UP,

03:19.460 --> 03:21.291
IT COULD LEAD US
RIGHT BACK TO "A."

03:21.330 --> 03:22.797
SPENCER, THIS GUY'S A GENIUS.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.923
IT'S THE THIRD BOOK OF HIS
I'VE READ THIS WEEK.

03:24.970 --> 03:27.564
IS TRAVIS READING THEM TO YOU?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.966
NO. I'M NOT SEEING HIM ANYMORE.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.830
I DECIDED NOT TO RUSH
INTO ANYTHING.

03:31.870 --> 03:34.839
WAIT, SO YOU STAYED HOME
TO READ A BOOK

03:34.880 --> 03:37.007
INSTEAD OF GOING TO THAT
CHICK-FLICK WITH ARIA AND EMILY?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.779
WELL, I WASN'T INVITED.

03:38.810 --> 03:40.710
WHY?
WHY?

03:40.750 --> 03:42.445
BECAUSE EMILY
IS SO PISSED AT YOU

03:42.490 --> 03:44.788
THAT SHE'S PISSED AT ME
FOR NOT BEING PISSED AT YOU.

03:47.020 --> 03:48.988
WHERE IS YOUR DAD ANYWAY?
HE'S TEACHING IN SYRACUSE.

03:49.020 --> 03:53.354
I SWEAR, THE NEXT TIME
HE'S OUT OF TOWN,
I AM SO STAYING AT YOUR PLACE.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.296
HELLO THERE.

03:57.770 --> 03:58.998
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:59.030 --> 04:00.429
USING THE RESTROOM FACILITIES.

04:00.470 --> 04:01.994
I DON'T HAVE A TOILET
IN MY BEDROOM, MONA.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.564
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY HOUSE?

04:03.610 --> 04:06.329
I WAS INVITED HERE.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.529
BY MIKE.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.548
MIKE INVITED YOU?

04:09.580 --> 04:11.468
HERE? WHY?

04:11.510 --> 04:13.876
THIS MAY COME AS A SHOCK TO YOU,
EMILY, BUT SOME PEOPLE

04:13.920 --> 04:16.480
DON'T TUCK 'N ROLL
EVERY TIME I WALK INTO A ROOM.

04:19.090 --> 04:21.058
LOVE YOUR WALLPAPER,
BY THE WAY.

04:21.090 --> 04:22.785
IT'S SO YOU.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.496
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT *

04:34.540 --> 04:36.565
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

04:36.610 --> 04:39.704
* GOT A LOCKET,
IN YOUR POCKET *

04:39.740 --> 04:42.300
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

04:42.350 --> 04:44.500
* IF I SHOW YOU
THAN I KNOW YOU *

04:44.550 --> 04:47.610
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:47.650 --> 04:49.789
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET

04:49.820 --> 04:52.414
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD

04:55.490 --> 04:56.479
MIKE.

04:58.430 --> 04:59.499
WHAT'S UP?

04:59.530 --> 05:01.555
CAN YOU COME IN FOR A SEC?

05:02.900 --> 05:05.596
LOOK, I PROMISE I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE A HARD-ASS, OKAY?

05:05.630 --> 05:08.963
WE JUST-- WE HAVEN'T
REALLY HAD A CHANCE
TO TALK ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.900
I'LL FINISH CLEANING
AFTER SCHOOL.

05:10.940 --> 05:11.964
WAIT.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.976
WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH MONA?

05:16.010 --> 05:18.399
UH, WE MET IN A GROUP AT SCHOOL.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.918
AND WE HAVE
A LOT OF FRIENDS IN COMMON.

05:20.950 --> 05:21.917
WHAT GROUP?

05:21.950 --> 05:23.383
IT'S A DISCUSSION GROUP.

05:23.420 --> 05:24.739
IN THE COUNSELING CENTER.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.553
WE MEET UP AFTER SCHOOL
AND TALK ABOUT STUFF.

05:26.590 --> 05:28.080
LIKE WHAT? TERROR-TACTICS?

05:28.120 --> 05:31.055
MR. FAZELLI
KNOWS MONA'S PAST.

05:31.090 --> 05:32.694
FAZELLI RETIRED.

05:32.730 --> 05:35.392
THERE'S A NEW COUNSELOR
AND HE'S ACTUALLY COOL.

05:35.430 --> 05:39.833
WELL, I'M NOT COOL WITH YOU
COZYING UP TO SOMEONE WHO SPENT
JUNIOR YEAR TORTURING ME.

05:39.870 --> 05:42.703
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY.
WAS MONA HERE TO POOP OR SNOOP?

05:42.740 --> 05:43.832
ALL RIGHT, I'VE GOTTA GO.

05:43.870 --> 05:45.701
MONA IS A
VERY DANGEROUS PERSON, MIKE.

05:45.740 --> 05:47.071
SHE WASN'T SENT TO RADLEY
FOR SPA TREATMENTS.

05:47.110 --> 05:48.532
ARE YOU FINISHED?

05:48.580 --> 05:50.844
MONA BROKE UP OUR PARENTS,
ALL RIGHT?

05:50.880 --> 05:52.814
SHE'S THE ONE WHO WROTE
TO MOM ABOUT DAD AND MEREDITH.

05:52.850 --> 05:55.045
OUR PARENTS
BROKE THEMSELVES UP, ARIA.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.048
MAYBE IT'S TIME YOU LET GO
OF THAT AND STOP JUDGING.

05:57.090 --> 06:00.116
HOW AM I--
PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES, OKAY?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.787
I'VE DONE A LOT OF CRAP THAT
I'M NOT REAL PROUD OF MYSELF.

06:01.820 --> 06:05.119
AND I'M SURE SOMEONE'S STANDING
RIGHT NOW IN ANOTHER BEDROOM,
TALKING SMACK ABOUT ME.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.457
THERE'S NO COMPARISON.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.525
MONA TRIED
TO DESTROY OUR FAMILY.

06:08.560 --> 06:11.893
WELL, IF YOU'VE FORGIVEN DAD,
WHY CAN'T YOU FORGIVE
THE MESSENGER?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.907
( knock at door ):

06:17.940 --> 06:19.498
HEY, SWEETIE.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.906
I WENT AND I SPOKE
WITH THE MECHANIC MYSELF.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.044
DID HE SAY WHY
IT STOPPED?

06:24.080 --> 06:26.002
WELL, HE SAID IT WAS
SOME KIND OF COMPUTER GLITCH.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.575
BUT I DROVE IT HOME
AND IT RUNS FINE.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.212
DAD, IT WAS WORKING FINE
THAT NIGHT.

06:30.250 --> 06:34.016
THEN SUDDENLY THE GPS HAD,
LIKE, A STROKE OR SOMETHING
AND THE ENGINE STOPPED.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.154
WELL, HE SAID SOMETHING
PROBABLY TRIGGERED
THE ANTI-THEFT DEVICE

06:37.190 --> 06:39.658
AND SHUT IT DOWN
FROM A REMOTE LOCATION.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.895
BABY, YOU'RE JUST
DRIVING IT TO SCHOOL.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.828
I THINK IF YOU STAY CLOSE,
IT'LL BE FINE.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.508
I'LL TAKE MY BIKE.

06:51.940 --> 06:53.703
YOU KNOW, UM...

06:53.740 --> 06:56.106
I WOULD'VE TAKEN
A TEMPORARY FURLOUGH SOONER

06:56.140 --> 06:58.074
IF I'D KNOWN HOW SHAKEN UP
YOU WERE ABOUT THINGS.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.543
I'M NOT SHAKEN UP.

06:59.580 --> 07:02.743
EMILY, A CAR
PLOWED INTO THE LIVING ROOM,

07:02.790 --> 07:04.143
ALMOST KILLING YOU
AND YOUR MA.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.181
AND THE FACT THAT THE POLICE
DON'T KNOW WHO WAS DRIVING--

07:06.220 --> 07:09.656
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE ACCIDENT.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.749
WELL, SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.519
YOU'RE NOT EATING,
YOU'RE ACTING JUMPY.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.528
IT'S CALLED SENIOR YEAR, OKAY?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.528
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SCHOOL
I'M GOING TO.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.538
THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.037
I'LL GET THROUGH IT.

07:21.070 --> 07:24.039
OKAY. I'D STILL LIKE YOU
TO DRIVE TO SCHOOL.

07:24.070 --> 07:25.230
THEY SAY IT'S GONNA RAIN LATER.

07:25.270 --> 07:28.979
I'M TAKING MY BIKE. THANKS.

07:31.680 --> 07:33.648
SO WHAT EXACTLY
WAS THE PROBLEM?

07:33.680 --> 07:35.716
THE LANDLORD'S BEING A JERK
BECAUSE I BROKE THE LEASE.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.980
HE'S WITHHOLDING MY DEPOSIT
TILL I GIVE BACK ALL THE KEYS.

07:38.020 --> 07:39.510
MAYBE I COULD
PICK UP MALCOLM EARLY

07:39.560 --> 07:40.811
WHILE YOU DEAL
WITH THE LANDLORD.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.158
MALCOLM'S NOT HERE.
HE'S AT HOME.

07:43.190 --> 07:46.227
AS IN SEATTLE?

07:46.260 --> 07:47.955
YES, AS IN SEATTLE.
THAT'S HOME.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.968
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BRINGING HIM BACK.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.627
I CHANGED MY MIND.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.969
I'M JUST HERE TO DEAL
WITH THE LEASE AND SHIP BACK
SOME BOXES I LEFT IN STORAGE.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.662
SO, WHAT'RE YOU SAYING, MAGGIE?

07:57.710 --> 08:00.235
THAT I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
A CONNECTION TO MALCOLM
UNLESS IT'S THROUGH AN ATTORNEY?

08:00.280 --> 08:04.102
OH, UM...
I'LL JUST COME BACK LATER.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.142
NO, WE'RE DONE.
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.724
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT SHE WAS HERE.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.252
NO, THAT'S OKAY. THAT WAS
NOT GOING TO A GOOD PLACE.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.996
HOW CAN SHE TALK TO YOU
LIKE THAT AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT SHE'S--

08:23.030 --> 08:27.262
FLYING OFF THE HANDLE
ISN'T GONNA HELP ANYTHING, ARIA.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.268
PEOPLE GET WHAT THEY DESERVE.

08:29.300 --> 08:30.904
EVENTUALLY.

08:44.820 --> 08:46.344
THAT'S A KEEPER.

08:46.390 --> 08:50.258
IF YOU LIKE THAT SERIES,
YOU SHOULD REALLY CHECK OUT
SOME OF THE SWEDISH AUTHORS.

08:50.290 --> 08:54.624
FOR SOME REASON, THEY DO
MEATBALLS AND CRIME NOVELS
BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.890
I HATE THEIR MEATBALLS.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.758
I... I REALLY CAME OVER
TO APOLOGIZE.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.938
MY JOB, IT ISN'T EASY.

09:05.970 --> 09:08.677
BUT IT IS ESPECIALLY HARD
WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT

09:08.710 --> 09:12.669
YOU'VE TURNED INNOCENT PEOPLE
INTO COLLATERAL DAMAGE
DURING AN INVESTIGATION.

09:15.050 --> 09:16.745
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

09:16.790 --> 09:18.917
I HOPE THAT YOU AND YOUR MOM
ARE OKAY.

09:18.950 --> 09:21.783
WE'RE OKAY.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.685
GOOD.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.658
HERE.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.053
GET THIS.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.160
YOU WON'T REGRET IT.

09:37.770 --> 09:42.139
( phone chimes )

09:42.180 --> 09:44.740
( school bell rings )

09:44.780 --> 09:48.272
EM, I JUST GOT YOUR TEXT.
WHAT DID YOUR DAD SAY?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.015
IT'S WHAT HE DIDN'T SAY.

09:50.050 --> 09:52.382
"A" KILLED MY CAR
IN THE WOODS LAST WEEK.

09:52.420 --> 09:53.387
WHAT'S NEXT?

09:53.420 --> 09:55.911
WE DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE.
WE NEED MORE PROOF.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.928
DO WE?
COME TO THE BREW LATER.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.690
YOU CAN WATCH "A" PROGRAM
THE CAPPUCCINO MACHINE
TO MELT MY FACE OFF.

10:00.730 --> 10:03.699
EMILY--
NO, I DON'T EVEN FEEL SAFE
IN MY OWN HOUSE ANYMORE!

10:03.730 --> 10:06.961
LOOK, IF "A" DID HACK
INTO YOUR CAR, WOULDN'T HE
OWN UP TO IT BY NOW?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.833
THE SOCIOPATHIC MIND
FEEDS ON INTRICATE PATTERNS.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.168
HANNA, PLEASE STOP READING.
YOU'RE NOT A DETECTIVE.

10:12.210 --> 10:15.907
EVERY ROCK YOU TURN OVER
GETS PICKED UP
AND HURLED AT ALISON.

10:15.940 --> 10:17.669
YOU CAN PASS THAT ON
TO SPENCER, TOO.

10:17.710 --> 10:20.838
CAN YOU PLEASE
BURY THE HATCHET WITH HER?
I'M SICK OF TAKING SIDES.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.416
NO ONE'S ASKED YOU TO.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.645
EM, I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS
WITH MY PARENTS, OKAY?

10:24.690 --> 10:26.988
IT SUCKS AND NOBODY WINS.

10:27.020 --> 10:28.817
HEY.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.181
HEY.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.697
UM, EMILY, CAN I PLEASE
JUST SAY ONE THING?

10:32.730 --> 10:34.152
( slams locker )

10:37.070 --> 10:38.094
( sighs )

10:50.310 --> 10:51.379
OKAY, STOP.

10:51.410 --> 10:54.311
WHAT'RE YOU UP TO?
EXCUSE ME?

10:54.350 --> 10:57.319
DROP THE COUGAR-CRAP
AND TELL ME WHY YOU'RE
AFTER A 10th GRADER.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.318
WHAT TURNS YOU ON?
THE FACT THAT HE SHARES MY DNA

10:59.350 --> 11:01.409
OR THAT YOU HAVE FULL ACCESS
TO MY BEDROOM?

11:01.460 --> 11:05.021
OKAY. JESSE WARNED ME
THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

11:05.060 --> 11:06.755
WHO'S JESSE?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.119
THE NEW GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
THAT'S THE BEST THING

11:08.160 --> 11:11.391
THAT'S HAPPENED
TO THIS FRIGGIN' SCHOOL
SINCE WE GOT A COFFEE CART.

11:11.430 --> 11:13.159
HE SEES THROUGH THE BULL
AND HE HAS A GIFT

11:13.200 --> 11:15.168
OF BRINGING TOGETHER PEOPLE
WHO NEED EACH OTHER.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.306
OH, SO YOU'RE GONNA
TELL ME THAT JESSE MADE
THIS LITTLE LOVE-CONNECT ION?

11:18.340 --> 11:20.900
MONA, WHEN IT COMES
TO ME AND MY FRIENDS,
YOU ALWAYS HAVE AN AGENDA.

11:20.940 --> 11:24.171
NO, YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
ARE THE ONES WITH
THE AGENDA, ARIA.

11:24.210 --> 11:28.442
AFTER I HELPED
HANNA'S MOM GET OUT OF JAIL,
I WAS BURNED OFF LIKE A WART.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.187
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED.

11:31.220 --> 11:34.053
REALLY? THEN TELL ME.
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:34.090 --> 11:36.786
WHY WAS I ICED OUT
AFTER THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED?

11:36.830 --> 11:39.321
WHY DID THE INNER CIRCLE
SQUEEZE ME OUT AGAIN?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.093
RIGHT.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.360
WELL, I'M TIRED
OF BEING YOYO'ED,

11:45.400 --> 11:48.096
AND I AM HANGING OUT
WITH A DIFFERENT CROWD NOW.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.165
SO SUCK IT UP, ARIA.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.939
( bell rings )

11:57.880 --> 11:59.814
OH, HEY, ANDREW.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.943
LADIES FIRST.

12:01.980 --> 12:03.948
OH, NO, IT'S FINE.
I'LL COME BACK LATER.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.139
WAIT UP, KILLER.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.917
WANNA QUIZ EACH OTHER
ON THE WAY TO CLASS?

12:08.960 --> 12:10.222
QUIZ EACH OTHER FOR WHAT?

12:10.260 --> 12:11.352
YOU SERIOUS?

12:11.390 --> 12:14.052
DID YOU SPACE
ON THE PHYSICS TEST?

12:15.200 --> 12:17.760
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!

12:17.800 --> 12:19.961
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A "YES."

12:20.000 --> 12:23.458
UM...
YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA WING IT.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.934
THIS ISN'T WINGING MATERIAL.
I'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT CRAMMING.

12:26.980 --> 12:31.076
IF YOU'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT,
HOW COME YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE...

12:31.110 --> 12:32.372
ME?

12:32.410 --> 12:34.514
SLEEP IS OVERRATED.

12:34.550 --> 12:36.984
OKAY.

12:37.020 --> 12:40.979
UM... YOU KNOW WHAT?
ACTUALLY, COULD YOU
COVER FOR ME?

12:41.020 --> 12:43.250
AND THEN IF YOU'RE
NOT TOO BUSY AFTER SCHOOL,

12:43.290 --> 12:46.282
MAYBE YOU COULD COME BY
AND GIVE ME YOUR PHYSICS NOTES.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.059
YEAH.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.965
THAN KS.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.531
MR. FITZ?

13:02.580 --> 13:04.275
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

13:04.310 --> 13:07.143
YES, I DID.

13:07.180 --> 13:08.545
PLEASE COME IN.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.140
AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.863
WHOA! WHERE'S MY BOOK?
OKAY, IT WAS RIGHT HERE.

13:37.210 --> 13:38.347
THANK YOU.

13:40.650 --> 13:44.347
LAST TWO PAGES, HUH?
I'M IMPRESSED.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.950
OH, WELL, I ALWAYS READ
THE ENDINGS FIRST.

13:46.990 --> 13:50.084
WHAT? OF A MYSTERY?
THAT'S CRAZY.

13:50.130 --> 13:53.952
NO, IT'S NOT. HOW ELSE AM I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT CLUES
TO LOOK FOR?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.490
ALL RIGHT, GO BACK.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.020
YOU'VE GOTTA READ THE MIDDLE.
IT'S THE BIG TWIST.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.298
YOU'RE MISSING
THE BEST PART OF THE BOOK.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.298
WELL, SO FAR, ALL I'M MISSING

14:00.340 --> 14:03.832
IS A REINDEER SIGHTING
AND A CANOE TRIP DOWN A FJORD.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.438
WHAT? HOW DO YOU SAY IT?

14:07.480 --> 14:09.368
YOU WERE CLOSE.

14:11.110 --> 14:12.577
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT'S THE TWIST?

14:12.610 --> 14:14.043
NO WAY, UH-UH.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.308
I'M NOT INTO GIVING SPOILERS.

14:15.350 --> 14:18.615
OH, COME ON. YOU OWE ME.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.844
ALL RIGHT.

14:19.890 --> 14:23.428
ALL I'LL SAY IS THAT IT HAS
TO DO WITH THE DENTAL RECORDS.

14:23.460 --> 14:26.224
THE ONES THEY USED
TO I.D. THE BODY?

14:26.260 --> 14:29.320
IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO TEETH,
DOESN'T IT?

14:38.640 --> 14:40.938
HI. ARE YOU JESSE?

14:40.980 --> 14:43.244
I AM. DID WE SCHEDULE
AN APPOINTMENT?

14:43.280 --> 14:45.009
NO, I WAS JUST DROPPING BY TO--

14:45.050 --> 14:48.417
OH, WELL, LET'S NOT
TALK IN THE DOORWAY.
PLEASE, COME IN.

14:49.950 --> 14:50.939
OKAY.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.450
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

14:58.490 --> 15:01.994
ARIA MONTGOMERY.
I'M MIKE'S SISTER.

15:02.030 --> 15:05.522
WOW. MR. FAZELLI
IS DEFINITELY GONE.

15:05.570 --> 15:06.525
DO YOU MISS HIM?

15:06.570 --> 15:08.037
WHAT? OH, NO.

15:08.070 --> 15:10.038
HE WAS KINDA OLD SCHOOL.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.162
HIS HEAD SWEAT A LOT.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.404
LIKE A CHEESE.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.475
( chuckles )

15:13.510 --> 15:15.239
ARIA, PLEASE.
HAVE A SEAT.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.643
I WAS JUST A LITTLE CURIOUS
ABOUT MIKE'S GROUP.

15:23.690 --> 15:27.512
CAN ANYONE JOIN OR DID YOU
HANDPICK THE STUDENTS YOURSELF?

15:27.560 --> 15:28.686
IT'S OPEN TO EVERYONE.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.029
I DID REACH OUT
TO CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS

15:31.060 --> 15:33.426
WHO I KNOW HAVE BEEN THROUGH
SOME ROUGH PATCHES.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.427
WHY?

15:34.460 --> 15:36.018
WELL, IT'S JUST...

15:36.060 --> 15:38.164
MY LITTLE BROTHER HAS, UM...

15:38.200 --> 15:43.558
HE'S BEFRIENDED
THIS CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL
WHO'S BAD NEWS.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.168
BAD NEWS?

15:45.210 --> 15:47.178
YEAH.

15:47.210 --> 15:49.075
CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC?

15:51.380 --> 15:54.349
YOU'RE REFERRING TO MONA.

15:54.380 --> 15:55.745
WELL, AT LEAST YOU AGREE.

15:55.780 --> 15:59.079
I DIDN'T SAY I AGREED.
BUT I MADE AN EDUCATED GUESS.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.712
SO HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

16:00.760 --> 16:05.083
LOOK, HOW DO I SAY THIS
WITHOUT SOUNDING RUDE?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.098
TRY.
MONA'S THE DEVIL.

16:07.130 --> 16:10.361
AND I WOULD REALLY,
REALLY APPRECIATE IT

16:10.400 --> 16:12.197
IF YOU DIDN'T ENCOURAGE THEM
BEING TOGETHER.

16:12.230 --> 16:14.266
SOUNDS LIKE YOU STILL HAVE
SOME UNRESOLVED ISSUES.

16:14.300 --> 16:17.337
WITH MONA.
IF I STARTED,
WE'D BE HERE TILL FRIDAY.

16:17.370 --> 16:20.476
WELL, LET'S START ON TUESDAY.
SOUNDS LIKE YOU COULD REALLY
BENEFIT FROM JOINING OUR GROUP.

16:20.510 --> 16:22.569
OH, NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

16:22.610 --> 16:25.147
ARIA, IT'S A SAFE PLACE.
IT'S A PLACE WHERE
YOU CAN EXPLORE YOUR ANGER.

16:25.180 --> 16:26.602
I'M NOT ANGRY!

16:28.120 --> 16:29.473
( sighs )

16:29.520 --> 16:31.488
I'M JUST CONCERNED.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.456
AND THIS INDIVIDUAL'S HISTORY
SUPPORTS IT.

16:35.490 --> 16:38.459
WELL, I DON'T
DISCOURAGE FRIENDSHIPS.

16:38.490 --> 16:41.323
IF TWO STUDENTS BOND,
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE
FOUND COMMON GROUND.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.768
RIGHT.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.065
OKAY, WELL,
THANKS FOR HEARING ME OUT.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.499
ANY TIME.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.300
( knock at door )

17:00.350 --> 17:01.647
Wayne: MR. FITZ?

17:01.680 --> 17:05.218
MR. FIELDS, EMILY DIDN'T
TELL ME YOU WERE BACK IN TOWN.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.354
I ASKED MY C.O.
FOR A LITTLE PERSONAL TIME.

17:07.390 --> 17:10.518
GIVEN ALL THE THINGS
THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING
HERE ON THE HOME FRONT.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.757
YES, WELL, IT'S BEEN
AN EVENTFUL COUPLE OF MONTHS
FOR EMILY.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.620
HAS IT AFFECTED
HER SCHOOLWORK?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.093
I DON'T THINK SO.

17:17.130 --> 17:19.519
I MEAN, SENIOR YEAR
CAN BE QUITE--

17:19.570 --> 17:22.789
ROUGH, YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT SHE SAYS.

17:22.840 --> 17:26.367
HONESTLY, I THINK IT'S
SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT.

17:26.410 --> 17:29.106
STAYING AT
THE DILAURENTIS HOUSE,
THAT MAY'VE BEEN A MISTAKE.

17:29.140 --> 17:35.613
MY WIFE TELLS ME
THAT ALISON'S MOTHER, WELL...

17:35.650 --> 17:38.778
SHE ACTS AS IF HER DAUGHTER
IS GONNA WALK THROUGH
THE DOOR AGAIN.

17:40.520 --> 17:45.219
AND EMILY STAYED AND SLEPT
IN HER DEAD FRIEND'S BEDROOM,

17:45.260 --> 17:47.455
AND I THINK
IT TOOK A TOLL ON HER.

17:48.460 --> 17:52.692
YES, WELL,
I IMAGINE IT WOULD.

17:52.730 --> 17:54.163
HOW CAN I HELP?

17:54.200 --> 17:59.103
WELL, YOU SEEM TO BE
ONE OF THE FEW TEACHERS
SHE FEELS CONNECTED TO.

17:59.140 --> 18:02.507
I THINK
SHE REALLY TRUSTS YOU.

18:02.540 --> 18:06.078
AND, WELL, I'M WONDERING IF
YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP
GET HER BACK ON TRACK.

18:07.350 --> 18:11.787
WELL, I COULD GIVE HER SOME SORT
OF EXTRA-CURRICULAR PROJECT.

18:11.820 --> 18:15.415
SOMETHING SHE CAN REALLY
THROW HERSELF INTO AFTER SCHOOL.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.587
I THINK THAT MIGHT
DO HER A WORLD OF GOOD.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.428
WELL, I'M HAPPY
TO BE HERE FOR HER.

18:20.460 --> 18:21.757
I DO APPRECIATE IT.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.768
TAKE CARE.
YOU, TOO.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.499
( beeps )

18:34.910 --> 18:38.607
SO ONE MISCONCEPTION
IS THAT A NET FORCE IS REQUIRED
TO KEEP A BODY IN MOTION,

18:38.650 --> 18:43.747
WHEN IN FACT IT'S NEEDED TO
CHANGE WHATEVER CURRENT STATE
OF MOTION THE BODY IS IN.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.485
DID YOU GET THAT?

18:45.520 --> 18:48.557
UH, YEAH,
I THINK I DID.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.128
NICE ROOM. LOT OF RIBBONS.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.767
JUMPING, DRESSAGE...

18:57.800 --> 19:00.360
ALL THESE MEDALS FROM RIDING?
YEAH.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.799
I'VE GOT EVERYTHING IN HERE
BUT THE HORSE.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.762
HEY, UM...

19:03.810 --> 19:06.506
HOW MANY HOURS WOULD YOU
SAY YOU STUDIED FOR THIS?

19:06.540 --> 19:07.529
IN A ROW?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.502
I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, SEVEN.

19:09.540 --> 19:12.600
SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO KNOW
A LOT ABOUT NEWTON FOR THIS.

19:12.650 --> 19:14.379
ANDREW... ( clears throat)

19:15.550 --> 19:20.908
I DIDN'T ASK YOU HERE
TO STUDY, ANDREW.

19:23.260 --> 19:25.649
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.

19:25.690 --> 19:27.794
YOU HAVE?

19:27.830 --> 19:30.924
YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN
OF THE DECATHLON TEAM,

19:30.970 --> 19:34.292
YOU'RE A STARTING FORWARD,
AND SUMMA CUM LAUDE.

19:36.270 --> 19:38.261
IT'S TIME TO SHARE, ANDREW.

19:38.310 --> 19:40.301
OKAY.

19:40.340 --> 19:43.571
I'M JUST-- I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN YOUR NOTES, OKAY?

19:43.610 --> 19:47.273
I WANT SOME OF YOUR STUDY AID.

19:47.320 --> 19:51.541
YOU KNOW, THE KIND
WITH THE CHILDPROOF CAP?

19:51.590 --> 19:54.286
I NEED TO STAY UP
FOR A WHILE.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.810
I DON'T HAVE ANY OF THAT.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.418
ANDREW, COME ON.

19:57.460 --> 19:59.678
I'M YOUR STUDY-BUDDY
FOR, LIKE, THREE CLASSES.

19:59.730 --> 20:02.290
PLUS, ONCE I SHOWED YOU
MY SIDE BOOB.

20:02.330 --> 20:05.561
( chuckles )

20:05.600 --> 20:08.694
I HAVE A LEGIT PRESCRIPTION.
I CAN GIVE YOU A FEW BUT--

20:08.740 --> 20:11.538
I JUST NEED ENOUGH
TO GET THROUGH THE WEEK.

20:11.570 --> 20:14.937
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP.
WHAT?

20:14.980 --> 20:18.643
SINCE WHEN DOES
SPENCER HASTINGS TRUST
ANYONE'S NOTES BUT HER OWN?

20:18.680 --> 20:20.944
WHY'D YOU COME HERE THEN?

20:20.980 --> 20:26.282
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WERE
DONE WITH THAT CARPENTER.

20:34.830 --> 20:36.354
THAN KS.

20:37.430 --> 20:38.795
( dog barking )

20:38.830 --> 20:41.390
( sighs )

20:41.440 --> 20:42.589
( clattering )

20:42.640 --> 20:44.938
DAD?

20:44.970 --> 20:46.005
( dog barking )

20:55.050 --> 20:56.244
( dog barking )

20:58.550 --> 20:59.915
( dog barking )

20:59.950 --> 21:03.351
( stairs creaking )

21:03.390 --> 21:04.425
( gasps )

21:09.030 --> 21:12.796
( footsteps approaching )

21:23.950 --> 21:25.474
( grunts )

21:25.510 --> 21:28.673
OH, MY GOD!
I'M SORRY! I'M SORRY!

21:28.720 --> 21:32.440
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.090
Spencer:
"WE'RE AT A COLLEGE BAR.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.732
THE HART AND HUNTSMAN."

21:51.840 --> 21:53.398
"HE LIKES TO TAKE ME THERE.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.670
BUT HE DOESN'T LIKE
TO CALL THEM 'DATES."'

21:55.710 --> 21:59.043
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK ABOUT MY STORIES?

21:59.080 --> 22:01.548
"YOU HAVE A STRONG VOICE."

22:01.580 --> 22:02.877
BUT...?

22:02.920 --> 22:04.888
"BUT NOTHING.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.354
IT'S ONLY GONNA GET
MORE DISTINCT IVE
AS YOU GROW UP."

22:07.390 --> 22:08.550
GROW UP?

22:08.590 --> 22:10.820
"YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
MATURE."

22:10.860 --> 22:16.526
OH. SO YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I'M MATURE ENOUGH?

22:16.560 --> 22:17.925
"I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

22:17.970 --> 22:21.462
I JUST THINK ALL
GREAT LITERATURE
BOILS DOWN TO TWO THEMES:

22:21.500 --> 22:24.139
LOVE AND DEATH."

22:24.170 --> 22:26.400
WHATEVER.

22:26.440 --> 22:30.399
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M TAKING ADVICE FROM SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO ORDER.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.374
WHO EATS BOYSENBERRY PIE
WITH BEER?

22:33.420 --> 22:36.469
"DON'T KNOCK IT
TILL YOU TRY IT."

22:36.520 --> 22:40.479
I SHOULD WRITE
A STORY ABOUT YOU.

22:40.520 --> 22:45.787
MAYBE I'LL WRITE ONE
ABOUT THIS MOMENT... RIGHT NOW.

22:59.010 --> 23:02.730
YOU'RE LUCKY MY MOM FINISHED
HER BOX OF CHARDONNAY.

23:02.780 --> 23:04.145
DO YOU KNOW HOW LOUD YOU WERE?

23:04.180 --> 23:05.602
YOU WEREN'T
ANSWERING YOUR PHONE.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.538
SPENCER, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?

23:07.580 --> 23:08.808
NO, I NEVER WENT TO BED.

23:08.850 --> 23:10.886
IT'S FOUR.
LOOK, WHO CARES, OKAY?

23:10.920 --> 23:13.013
I FINALLY GOT A LEAD.
IT'S THE HART AND HUNTSMAN.

23:13.050 --> 23:14.711
WHAT?
IT'S THIS PUB.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.716
IT'S A BAR
OUTSIDE OF HOLLIS COLLEGE,

23:16.760 --> 23:18.580
WHERE ALI'S MYSTERY MAN
TOOK HER FOR PIE AND BEER.

23:18.630 --> 23:19.585
DO YOU WANNA COME WITH ME?

23:19.630 --> 23:21.552
NOW? I'M NOT WEARING
ANY UNDERWEAR.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.658
NO, AFTER FIFTH PERIOD.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.828
NO. NO, I CAN'T. I SCHEDULED
A CLEANING AT THE DENTIST.

23:25.870 --> 23:28.998
YOU'RE GONNA PASS UP FINDING
THE PERSON WHO'S AFTER ALI
TO GET YOUR PLAQUE SCRAPED?

23:29.040 --> 23:32.134
SPENCE, DON'T YOU GET IT?
ALI WENT TO THE SAME DENTIST.

23:32.170 --> 23:35.571
THE POLICE USED DENTAL RECORDS
TO PROVE THAT BODY WAS ALISON'S,

23:35.610 --> 23:36.975
AND WE KNOW IT WASN'T.

23:37.010 --> 23:38.671
SO SOMEONE
SWITCH ED THE X-RAYS

23:38.710 --> 23:40.143
TO MATCH WHOEVER
WAS IN THAT GRAVE.

23:40.180 --> 23:41.169
OKAY.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.142
IF I FIND OUT
WHO WAS IN THAT OFFICE

23:43.180 --> 23:44.147
AFTER THEY FOUND THE BODY,

23:44.190 --> 23:46.078
WE'RE THAT MUCH CLOSER
TO FINDING OUT WHO "A" IS.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.781
SO YOU THINK THAT "A"
WENT IN THERE AS A PATIENT?

23:47.820 --> 23:49.048
IT'S BETTER THAN BREAKING IN.

23:49.090 --> 23:50.785
AND I KNOW WHERE
THEY KEEP THOSE RECORDS.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.786
I USED TO FILE THEM.
OKAY.

23:52.830 --> 23:54.923
OKAY, SO YOU GO TO THE DENTIST,
AND I'LL GO TO THE PUB.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.155
SHOULD WE UPDATE ARIA AND EMILY
ABOUT ANY OF THIS?

23:57.200 --> 24:00.795
NO, EMILY WILL LOSE IT
IF SHE THINKS THAT WE'RE
HUNTING DOWN CLUES AGAIN.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.832
I DON'T THINK
I CAN MAKE HER ANY ANGRIER
THAN SHE ALREADY IS.

24:03.870 --> 24:05.906
SPENCE, THIS ISN'T FOREVER.

24:05.940 --> 24:09.239
ONCE WE FIND OUT WHO "A" IS,
ALL WILL BE FORGIVEN.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.840
YEAH.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.818
HEY THERE.

24:22.860 --> 24:24.179
OH, HI.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.495
UM, IT'S OKAY
IF I PARK HERE, RIGHT?

24:27.530 --> 24:28.827
WELL, IT DEPENDS.

24:28.860 --> 24:30.896
HOW LONG DO YOU
PLAN ON STAYING?

24:32.030 --> 24:34.669
JUST AS LONG AS IT TAKES ME
TO MAIL THIS.

24:34.700 --> 24:35.928
THEN THAT'S IT?

24:35.970 --> 24:37.767
THEN YOU'RE OUT OF HERE
FOR GOOD?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.960
I THINK SO. WHY?

24:40.010 --> 24:42.570
YOU KNOW HOW BADLY EZRA
WANTED TO SEE MALCOLM.

24:42.610 --> 24:45.249
SO COMING UP HERE WITHOUT HIM
WAS A REALLY NASTY THING TO DO.

24:45.280 --> 24:48.818
ARIA, IT'S REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
OH, REALLY?

24:48.850 --> 24:52.217
WELL, IT SURE WAS WHEN YOU
ASKED ME NOT TO TELL EZRA
THAT MALCOLM WAS HIS KID.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.912
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME--
NO.

24:54.960 --> 24:58.919
NO, THERE IS NO EXCUSE
FOR SOMEONE TO LIE ABOUT
SOMETHING LIKE THAT

24:58.960 --> 25:00.655
AND SCREW UP SOMEONE'S LIFE.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.258
AND IF YOU COUNT MALCOLM,
THAT'S TWO PEOPLE.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.724
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT YOU AND MR. FITZ
WERE STILL SO CLOSE.

25:05.770 --> 25:08.261
HE'S LUCKY TO HAVE A STUDENT
WHO'S SO PROTECTIVE OF HIM.

25:08.300 --> 25:12.009
WELL, MR. FITZ
IS TOO MUCH OF A GENTLEMAN
TO KICK YOU TO THE CURB.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.268
BUT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.130
I'M GUESSING THAT YOU'VE
DONE SOME LYING YOURSELF

25:15.180 --> 25:16.408
WHEN IT COMES TO MR. FITZ.

25:16.440 --> 25:19.238
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT THE KIND THAT
INCLUDES BLACKMAILING HIS FAMILY

25:19.280 --> 25:21.714
INTO PAYING
FOR A THREE BEDROOM HOUSE
AND A FANCY SUMMER CAMP.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.240
WELL, THAT'S RICH,
COMING FROM A KID

25:23.280 --> 25:24.713
WHO MAINTAINS
HER GRADE POINT AVERAGE

25:24.750 --> 25:26.047
BY SLEEPING WITH HER TEACHER.

25:32.260 --> 25:35.127
OH, MY GOD. I'M SORRY.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.196
JUST LEAVE IT.

25:44.070 --> 25:45.162
YOU RAN AWAY?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.633
NO. I WALKED. FAST.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.898
I BASICALLY JUST MADE
THINGS WORSE FOR EZRA.

25:49.940 --> 25:51.908
SHE'LL MAKE SURE THAT HE
NEVER SEES MALCOLM EVER AGAIN.

25:51.950 --> 25:54.919
IT'S NOT LIKE
HE ASKED YOU TO CONFRONT HER.
IT HAPPENED IN THE MOMENT.

25:54.950 --> 25:58.181
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.
ONCE SHE TELLS HIM--

25:58.220 --> 26:01.212
ARIA, YOU WERE
ACTING AS HIS FRIEND, OKAY?

26:01.260 --> 26:02.682
HE'S NOT GONNA BE THAT MAD.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.256
PLUS, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE STILL SEEING HIM.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.022
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
IF I SKIP HIS CLASS,
WILL YOU COVER FOR ME?

26:10.060 --> 26:11.288
JUST IN CASE HE ASKS.

26:11.330 --> 26:14.037
I'LL TRY. I'LL BE SEEING FITZ
OUT OF CLASS, TOO.

26:14.070 --> 26:16.368
MY DAD DRAFTED ME
TO CO-DIRECT THE SPRING PLAY
WITH HIM.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.708
WHAT? WHY?

26:17.740 --> 26:19.367
MY DAD
THINKS I'M A BASKET-CASE.

26:19.410 --> 26:21.378
BECAUSE YOU WON'T
DRIVE YOUR CAR?

26:21.410 --> 26:23.947
BECAUSE I TRIED TO STAB HIM
WITH SCISSORS.

26:23.980 --> 26:25.299
YOUR DAD? WHAT--

26:32.150 --> 26:34.357
I GOTTA GO.

26:34.390 --> 26:38.156
( gagging )

26:38.190 --> 26:41.023
SEAN'S COMING HOME
FROM BOARDING SCHOOL SOON.

26:41.060 --> 26:44.029
HE MADE QUITE A SPLASH THERE.
ESPECIALLY WITH THE LADIES.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.288
LOOKS LIKE I MISSED OUT.

26:46.330 --> 26:48.639
YOU HAVE A LOOSE FILLING
IN NUMBER 29.

26:48.670 --> 26:50.763
DR. ACKARD'S GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.163
TODAY? HOW LONG
IS THAT GONNA TAKE?

26:52.210 --> 26:53.905
WHY? ARE YNJCL)! IN A RUSH?

26:53.940 --> 26:55.635
TOOTH DECAY LEADS
TO HEART DISEASE, HANNA.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.102
DIDN'T YOU LEARN THAT
WHEN YOU WORKED HERE?

26:57.140 --> 26:58.209
YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW.

26:58.250 --> 27:01.014
WELL, THEN I'M JUST GONNA GO
BACK TO THE WAITING ROOM.

27:01.050 --> 27:03.177
OH, NO, YOU'RE FINE RIGHT HERE,
HON. JUST SIT TIGHT.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.791
u u u **
( IndIstInct chatter )

27:23.170 --> 27:25.035
MR. FITZ?

27:26.440 --> 27:29.375
HEY. SPENCER, UH...

27:29.410 --> 27:31.275
SORRY, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO INTERRUPT.

27:31.310 --> 27:35.417
NO, IT'S OKAY.
I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU IN THIS SETTING.

27:35.450 --> 27:37.145
HAVE YOU BEEN HERE BEFORE?

27:37.180 --> 27:39.683
NO. NO, I NEVER HAVE.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.381
THAT LOOKS GOOD.
WHAT IS IT?

27:41.420 --> 27:43.854
BOYSENBERRY.

27:43.890 --> 27:46.120
OR ACTUALLY
IT MIGHT BE BLACKBERRY.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.856
I DON'T KNOW. I'M GOING OFF
A RECOMMENDATION
FROM THE WAITRESS.

27:48.900 --> 27:52.028
OH, EXCUSE ME,
COULD I ACTUALLY CANCEL
THE REST OF MY ORDER?

27:52.070 --> 27:54.129
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW LATE IT WAS AND I
ACTUALLY NEED TO GET GOING.

27:54.170 --> 27:56.764
Waitress: NO PROBLEM.
GREAT.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.133
SORRY TO RUN OUT ON YOU.
ARE YOU MEETING SOMEONE HERE?

28:01.880 --> 28:05.475
GREAT. WELL, IT WAS GREAT
RUNNING INTO YOU.

28:05.510 --> 28:08.070
TRY THE PIE.
IT'S PRETTY GREAT.
YEAH.

28:09.080 --> 28:12.083
YEAH, SO I'VE HEARD.

28:21.930 --> 28:23.295
HEY, IT'S ME.

28:23.330 --> 28:26.424
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF MAGGIE HAD CALLED.

28:26.470 --> 28:29.439
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO GO OFF ON HER LIKE THAT.

28:29.470 --> 28:31.438
SHE'S PROBABLY ALREADY
CALLED HER LAWYER AND TOLD HER

28:31.470 --> 28:34.200
THAT YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH
SOME VIOLENT PSYCHOTIC FREAK.

28:36.140 --> 28:39.200
( sighs )
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.241
I THINK I'M JUST SO ANGRY AND...

28:43.320 --> 28:45.288
JUST CALL ME WHEN YOU CAN.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.742
OR NOT.

28:46.790 --> 28:47.779
BYE.

28:58.200 --> 29:01.135
OKAY, HANNA...

29:05.210 --> 29:08.771
DR. ACKARD, IT LOOKS LIKE
HANNA MARIN COULDN'T WAIT.

29:08.810 --> 29:11.404
SO I'LL CALL HER TOMORROW
TO SCHEDULE A FOLLOW-UP.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.543
SHE WAS THE LAST ON THE BOOKS,
SO I'M GOING TO HEAD OUT.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.047
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.181
( door shuts )

29:43.080 --> 29:44.809
( beeping )

29:57.460 --> 29:59.428
HOW'S IT GOING?

29:59.460 --> 30:01.394
HEY. GOOD.

30:01.430 --> 30:03.864
BEEN AT IT FOR A WHILE
OVER THERE, HUH?

30:03.900 --> 30:07.529
YEAH, IT'S A HISTORY PAPER,
SO THERE'S A LOT OF READING.

30:07.570 --> 30:10.539
I WANTED TO ASK YOU,
HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY MORE THOUGHT
TO JOINING OUR GROUP?

30:10.570 --> 30:13.869
UM... NO.

30:17.340 --> 30:21.174
LOOK, JESSE,
I'M NOT TOTALLY CLUELESS.

30:21.220 --> 30:24.917
I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME THINGS
THAT I NEED TO WORK THROUGH.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.550
I JUST NEED AN OUTLET,
LIKE...

30:28.590 --> 30:29.989
ROLLER DERBY?

30:30.020 --> 30:31.487
YOU HAVE A GROUP
FOR THAT, TOO?

30:31.530 --> 30:35.455
( chuckles )
NO, BUT I GOT BASKETBALL.
SATURDAY MORNING PICK-UP GAMES.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.559
I'LL PASS.
FAIR ENOUGH.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.091
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE
FOR A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.199
MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.229
ALL RIGHT.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.107
THANK YOU.

30:48.540 --> 30:49.336
I JUST...

30:51.110 --> 30:54.273
I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO LOSE MY BROTHER.

30:56.950 --> 30:58.918
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SIT DOWN?

30:58.950 --> 31:02.078
WHAT? NO. NO, I GOTTA GO.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.257
THAN KS.

31:16.500 --> 31:20.334
HEY, DR. ACKARD. YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT'S REALLY GREAT
THAT SEAN'S COMING BACK.

31:20.370 --> 31:22.338
I FEEL BAD
THAT WE LOST TOUCH.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.439
I HOPE HE'S NOT MAD AT ME FOR--

31:24.480 --> 31:25.947
( gasps )

31:52.010 --> 31:53.261
WHAT'S THIS?

31:53.310 --> 31:56.529
HE ALREADY PAID FOR IT,
SO I FIGURED WHY NOT?

31:56.580 --> 31:59.003
BUT IF ANYONE ASKS,
I CHECKED YOUR I.D.

31:59.050 --> 32:02.076
BOYSENBERRY PIE AND BEER?
THAT'S WHAT HE ORDERED?

32:02.120 --> 32:04.611
I KNOW, KINDA GROSS, RIGHT?

32:04.650 --> 32:05.947
YEAH. THAN KS.

32:12.260 --> 32:16.094
Alison: SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT MY STORIES?

32:16.130 --> 32:18.360
Ezra: YOU HAVE
A VERY STRONG VOICE.

32:18.400 --> 32:19.992
BUT...?

32:20.030 --> 32:21.258
BUT NOTHING.

32:21.300 --> 32:23.689
IT'S JUST GOING
TO GET MORE DISTINCT IVE
AS YOU GROW UP.

32:23.740 --> 32:24.707
GROW UP?

32:24.740 --> 32:26.662
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

32:26.710 --> 32:29.270
MORE... MATURE.

32:29.310 --> 32:34.441
OH. SO YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I'M MATURE ENOUGH?

32:34.480 --> 32:37.608
NO, I NEVER SAID THAT.

32:37.650 --> 32:40.687
I JUST THINK THAT
ALL GREAT LITERATURE
BOILS DOWN TO TWO THEMES:

32:40.720 --> 32:42.449
LOVE AND DEATH.

32:42.490 --> 32:44.458
WHATEVER.

32:44.490 --> 32:46.321
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M TAKING ADVICE

32:46.360 --> 32:48.453
FROM SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T
KNOW HOW TO ORDER.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.389
WHO EATS
BOYSENBERRY PIE WITH BEER?

32:51.430 --> 32:55.196
DO NOT KNOCK IT
UNTIL YOU TRY IT.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.330
I SHOULD WRITE
A STORY ABOUT YOU.

32:59.370 --> 33:02.601
MAYBE I'LL EVEN WRITE ONE
ABOUT THIS MOMENT...

33:21.060 --> 33:23.028
( copy machine whirring )

33:37.180 --> 33:38.169
( door shuts )

33:45.390 --> 33:46.743
MR. FITZ?

33:46.790 --> 33:51.056
( door opens and shuts )

33:52.430 --> 33:54.694
MR. FITZ, IS THAT YOU?

34:39.670 --> 34:42.173
( loud static )

34:42.210 --> 34:46.476
( heavy metal playing )

34:49.420 --> 34:51.388
DAD?

34:51.420 --> 34:52.785
DAD, ARE YOU THERE?

34:52.820 --> 34:54.879
I NEED YOU TO COME TO THE SCHOOL
AND PICK ME UP.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.785
( gasps )

34:58.860 --> 35:00.555
MR. FITZ ISN'T HERE,

35:00.590 --> 35:04.196
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE BY MYSELF BECAUSE--

35:04.230 --> 35:06.198
ANYWAY, AS SOON AS YOU
GET THIS MESSAGE,

35:06.230 --> 35:08.460
PLEASE COME TO THE SCHOOL
AND PICK ME UP IMMEDIATELY.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.263
I'M HERE. I'M IN THE BACK HALL.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.302
( car alarm sounding )

35:16.840 --> 35:18.569
( alarm stops )

35:19.850 --> 35:21.169
( groans )

35:36.500 --> 35:38.593
( heavy metal playing )

35:44.940 --> 35:47.431
( grunting )

35:54.620 --> 35:57.919
( loud static )

35:57.950 --> 36:00.384
( grunting )

36:10.700 --> 36:15.160
DAD! DAD, I'M UP HERE!

36:27.980 --> 36:29.538
( grunts )

36:29.580 --> 36:31.548
( screams )

36:44.870 --> 36:46.826
( grunts )

36:46.870 --> 36:49.839
DAD! COME ON!

36:49.870 --> 36:51.360
DAD, I'M UP HERE!

36:51.410 --> 36:53.935
DAD, I'M UP HERE!
I'M COMING, BABY!

36:53.970 --> 36:56.803
DAD, YOU HAVE TO GET ME OUT!

36:58.850 --> 37:01.614
OH, YEAH! GET ME OUT OF HERE!

37:01.650 --> 37:03.868
( banging )

37:05.390 --> 37:06.709
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN HERE!

37:07.750 --> 37:11.425
COME ON! DAD, HURRY! COME ON!

37:11.460 --> 37:14.896
THERE'S SOMEBODY IN HERE!
HE'S TRYING TO GET ME!

37:14.930 --> 37:16.727
OH, YEAH!

37:16.760 --> 37:19.820
THE ENTRANCE!
I'M COMING!

37:19.870 --> 37:21.735
OKAY, OKAY.

37:21.770 --> 37:25.365
( grunting )

37:25.410 --> 37:26.729
I GOT YOU.

37:26.770 --> 37:29.603
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE!

37:29.640 --> 37:30.709
WE HAVE TO GO!

37:32.510 --> 37:34.569
HURRY UP!

37:43.520 --> 37:46.353
( panting )

37:46.390 --> 37:51.020
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE PANICKED,
BUT WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT--

37:51.060 --> 37:52.891
DAD!

37:52.930 --> 37:55.637
DAD!
( gasps )

38:02.580 --> 38:04.548
( indistinct
radio transmission )

38:06.950 --> 38:08.372
SHOULD WE CALL MOM BACK?

38:08.420 --> 38:09.910
LET'S WAIT TILL WE GET
TO THE HOSPITAL, YEAH?

38:09.950 --> 38:10.712
DAD...

38:10.750 --> 38:12.786
EMILY, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
ALL RIGHT?

38:12.820 --> 38:16.381
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.
NO.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.650
LISTEN, YOU WERE
LOCKED IN A ROOM.
THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.

38:18.690 --> 38:20.658
I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU PANICKED.

38:20.690 --> 38:24.660
( sighs) I DON'T KNOW HOW
MUCH MORE I CAN TAKE OF THIS.

38:24.700 --> 38:30.969
PRINCESS, I DIDN'T TELL YOU
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.935
TELL ME WHAT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:33.970 --> 38:40.808
EMILY, I DIDN'T JUST COME HOME
TO CHECK UP ON YOU AND YOUR MOM.

38:40.850 --> 38:42.818
I HAD SOME TESTS DONE.

38:42.850 --> 38:45.410
I DIDN'T WANT THEM DONE
ON THE BASE.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.680
WHAT'S WRONG?
ARE YOU SICK?

38:47.720 --> 38:50.018
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY RESULTS BACK YET.

38:50.060 --> 38:52.756
IT'S MY HEART.

38:52.790 --> 38:58.626
IT'S JUST STRESS.
I'LL GET IT UNDER CONTROL.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.023
YOU HAVE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR HEART?

39:00.070 --> 39:01.833
WHY-WHY WOULD YOU
KEEP THIS FROM ME?

39:01.870 --> 39:06.830
BECAUSE I AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

39:06.870 --> 39:08.428
DO YOU HEAR ME?

39:08.480 --> 39:13.099
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME
FOR THE LONG HAUL, KID.

39:13.150 --> 39:15.471
HEY, COME ON.

39:18.620 --> 39:19.882
IT'S OKAY.

39:21.020 --> 39:24.888
(crying )
SHH.

39:26.730 --> 39:29.722
(crying )
SHH.

39:33.130 --> 39:34.688
YOU SHOULD TAKE ME BACK.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.093
EM, YOUR MOM'S RIGHT.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.994
YOU DON'T WANT TO SLEEP
IN A HOSPITAL ROOM.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.600
YOUR DAD'S IN GREAT HANDS
AND YOUR MOM'S WITH HIM.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.607
"A" ALMOST KILLED HIM TONIGHT.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.403
YEAH, BUT "A" COULDN'T
HAVE KNOWN THAT YOUR DAD--

39:43.440 --> 39:44.600
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

39:44.650 --> 39:46.868
HE ALMOST DIED
TRYING TO SAVE ME! FROM WHO?

39:46.910 --> 39:49.947
WE'RE STILL NOT
ANY CLOSER TO FIGURING OUT
WHO THIS ANIMAL IS!

39:53.590 --> 39:57.811
WHAT? WHO IS IT?

39:57.860 --> 40:00.727
IT'S SPENCER.
I TEXTED HER ABOUT YOUR DAD.

40:07.670 --> 40:08.932
HEY.

40:10.940 --> 40:13.602
PLEASE DON'T SEND ME AWAY.

40:18.240 --> 40:19.548
OH, MY GOD.

40:26.220 --> 40:27.187
( sighs )

40:27.220 --> 40:28.710
HAN NA?
THANK GOD.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.729
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

40:31.760 --> 40:33.125
I WAS AT THE DENTIST,

40:33.160 --> 40:35.628
AND I THINK THAT
I GOT TREATED BY "A."

40:35.660 --> 40:38.493
WHAT? YOU'VE BEEN AT
THE DENTIST THIS WHOLE TIME?

40:38.530 --> 40:40.919
I THOUGHT YOUR APPOINTMENT
WAS AT 4:30.
YEAH, I KNOW.

40:40.970 --> 40:44.667
AND I STOLE THOSE
APPOINTMENT PAGES
FROM THAT SEPTEMBER--

40:44.710 --> 40:46.007
YOU GOT THEM?
SHOW THEM TO US.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.064
NO, I DON'T HAVE THEM.

40:47.110 --> 40:49.829
LOOK, WHEN I WOKE UP,
I WAS IN A DENTIST CHAIR,

40:49.880 --> 40:51.802
THE LIGHTS WERE OFF,
AND MY JAW HURT.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.875
I STILL FEEL LIKE
HALF OF MY LIP IS FROZEN.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.741
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU THINK THAT "A" FROZE YOU?

40:55.780 --> 40:58.146
THAT "A" STUCK A NEEDLE
IN YOUR GUMS?
I DON'T KNOW.

40:58.180 --> 40:59.886
ALL I KNOW IS
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN

40:59.920 --> 41:02.184
CHEWING ON A SEWING KIT
FOR THE PAST HOUR.

41:02.220 --> 41:03.585
THIS IS CRAZY.

41:03.620 --> 41:06.157
DO WE THINK THE SAME PERSON
WHO HUNTED ME DOWN
AT SCHOOL TONIGHT

41:06.190 --> 41:07.828
SPENT THE AFTERNOON
OPERATING ON HANNA?

41:07.860 --> 41:09.919
OH, MY GOD.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.598
WHO IS THIS MONSTER?

41:14.600 --> 41:18.707
ONE OF YOU JUST PLEASE
LOOK INSIDE MY MOUTH.

41:19.870 --> 41:21.201
DO YOU SEE ANYTHING?

41:21.240 --> 41:22.673
STOP MOVING.

41:22.710 --> 41:24.109
IT HURTS.

41:27.210 --> 41:29.678
ARIA, GIVE ME THE TWEEZERS.

41:30.750 --> 41:32.012
I'M SORRY.

41:33.720 --> 41:35.881
( grunting )

41:35.920 --> 41:38.115
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. HOLD ON.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.084
OKAY, OKAY...

41:44.600 --> 41:45.919
WHAT IS THAT?

41:45.970 --> 41:47.597
I HAVE NO IDEA.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.899
THAT WAS IN MY MOUTH?

41:58.850 --> 42:00.841
OH, MY GOD.

42:02.280 --> 42:03.577
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

42:03.620 --> 42:05.144
I CAN'T READ IT.

42:06.620 --> 42:07.848
HERE.

42:09.190 --> 42:12.626
"I TOLD YOU:
DEAD GIRLS CAN'T SMILE.

42:12.660 --> 42:15.128
STOP LOOKING. - A"

42:41.290 --> 42:43.588
( squawks )
HEY, BOARD SHORTS.

42:43.620 --> 42:46.589
( whistles )

42:46.630 --> 42:47.722
( squawks )

42:47.760 --> 42:49.751
MISS ME?
