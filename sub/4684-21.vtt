WEBVTT

00:01.466 --> 00:02.766
No, no, no!

00:02.833 --> 00:04.800
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.866 --> 00:07.866
Here's what's
on my mind tonight..

00:10.933 --> 00:13.766
Reverend Jarvis
just got a new assignment.

00:13.833 --> 00:16.600
I need you on death row.
Final counseling.

00:16.666 --> 00:20.333
Now he's the last comfort
for a condemned woman.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.533
Kneel with me and pray.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.733
But what he gets
is worse than death.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.100
Please give me redemption.

00:27.166 --> 00:30.700
You're coming straight tohe

00:32.333 --> 00:35.400
On the next
"Freddy's Nightmares.."

00:55.233 --> 00:57.500
You're in Springwood now

00:57.566 --> 00:59.600
and you're all mine.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.533
Now she's ready.

02:07.933 --> 02:09.900
Why don't you die, dammit?

02:15.400 --> 02:17.333
I'm sorry, warden,
she's not dead.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.833
Full power!

03:00.633 --> 03:03.666
- Shit!
- 'Yoo-hoo! Heh heh.'

03:03.733 --> 03:05.066
'Looking for me, sailor?'

03:05.133 --> 03:06.766
Eat it, Brenda.

03:06.833 --> 03:08.966
'Oh, come on, honey.'

03:09.033 --> 03:11.266
I heard you having a nightmare.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.900
And then I heard you
scrounging around.

03:13.966 --> 03:15.800
You gotta want some of these.

03:15.866 --> 03:17.833
What'd you do? Poison 'em?

03:18.600 --> 03:20.200
'Violet..'

03:20.266 --> 03:22.066
I don't want&lt;
from you except you

03:22.133 --> 03:24.666
stayin' out of my face!

03:24.733 --> 03:27.333
Only two days left
before they fry me

03:27.400 --> 03:29.800
and I gotta spend 'em
sitting next to you!

03:29.866 --> 03:33.233
Well, you got two days,
I got five.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.533
- Uh, we could make up.
- 'Ha ha ha.'

03:35.600 --> 03:36.633
Girlfriends.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.633
Uh, sure.

03:40.833 --> 03:44.233
Elm Street Angel
and a Southside Blade.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.800
Oh, come on, girl,
gang war's over.

03:46.866 --> 03:49.500
Hey, it&lt;

03:49.566 --> 03:51.500
and I'm not an Angel

03:51.566 --> 03:53.466
but you never believe me!

03:53.533 --> 03:55.433
Okay, fi.. I'm wrong.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.433
Okay?

03:57.366 --> 03:58.433
Here.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.400
- Okay.
- 'Peace.'

04:02.466 --> 04:04.200
Thanks.

04:04.266 --> 04:07.433
You stupid Angel bitch!

04:07.500 --> 04:09.866
Blades don't forget
who killed one of their own.

04:09.933 --> 04:12.300
You're on death row,
but I'm your executioner!

04:13.033 --> 04:17.333
Ow! Jeez! God..

04:35.900 --> 04:39.033
When I get you..

04:39.100 --> 04:41.700
...you're gonna die
real painful!

04:42.866 --> 04:45.466
Have I got a recipe for you?

04:45.533 --> 04:47.833
All you need is one of these.

04:47.900 --> 04:49.666
Perfect for two women in a stir

04:49.733 --> 04:51.533
about to take their final walk.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.266
About to be..

04:53.333 --> 04:55.500
...stir-fried!

04:57.266 --> 04:58.233
Women?

04:58.300 --> 05:00.033
I know it stretches procedure

05:00.100 --> 05:02.233
Reverend Jarvis,
but I need help.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.066
Now your excellent work

05:05.133 --> 05:07.266
in the men's wing..

05:07.333 --> 05:09.700
...convinces me that I..

05:13.133 --> 05:15.100
What is that?

05:16.600 --> 05:17.666
It's Haitian.

05:17.733 --> 05:19.400
I-I worked
in a hospital mission there

05:19.466 --> 05:20.766
and an old woman
gave it to me

05:20.833 --> 05:22.366
for helping
to heal her daughter.

05:22.433 --> 05:25.400
It's a rather..

05:25.466 --> 05:27.533
...sensual carving.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.633
Well, the Haitians are, uh..

05:29.700 --> 05:30.700
...are an earthy people.

05:30.766 --> 05:32.500
I-I never really..

05:32.566 --> 05:34.566
...really got,
think I got used to it.

05:34.633 --> 05:37.833
Now, this is
Springwood State Prison

05:37.900 --> 05:39.900
not Haiti.

05:39.966 --> 05:42.400
Now, can you
help me out, reverend?

05:43.333 --> 05:44.800
Uh..

05:44.866 --> 05:47.266
I need you on death row.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.300
Final counseling.

05:49.366 --> 05:51.066
Brenda Vincent.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.333
Violet Rodriguez.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.400
Both are up for murder.

05:56.466 --> 05:58.733
Both from the same neighborhood.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.933
Gangs that mutually
hate each other.

06:07.766 --> 06:09.966
Violet is scheduled
for next Friday.

06:10.033 --> 06:13.266
She's priority.
Brenda's after that.

06:13.333 --> 06:16.233
Violet iced a kid
from another gang.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.033
Her jacket says she was
pretty straight before that.

06:32.366 --> 06:34.233
I've never heard
the "Sermon On The Mount"

06:34.300 --> 06:36.366
interpreted exactly that way.

06:38.366 --> 06:40.600
I told you
I knew the Bible, father.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.333
Eh, may I call you father?

06:44.400 --> 06:46.333
- Oh, I-I'm not a priest.
- Oh, yeah?

06:46.400 --> 06:49.066
Well, this is as close
as I'm gonna get.

06:49.133 --> 06:51.466
But, i-if it would
mean something to you

06:51.533 --> 06:53.500
y-you may call me father.

06:55.766 --> 06:58.000
So you-you are
close to the church.

06:59.100 --> 07:01.033
In my family,
in my neighborhood

07:01.100 --> 07:03.400
the church was hard to avoid.

07:04.233 --> 07:06.133
But then why here?

07:08.766 --> 07:10.800
There wereotherthing
in my neighborhood

07:10.866 --> 07:13.266
that were hard to avoid.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.533
So this is what's
become of me.

07:18.333 --> 07:20.600
I'm here to comfort you
as best I can.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.933
You don't have vows
about women, do you, father?

07:28.866 --> 07:30.666
We are allowed to marry

07:30.733 --> 07:32.700
i-if that's what you mean.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.100
So are you?

07:38.766 --> 07:40.600
M-married? Uh, no.

07:40.666 --> 07:41.800
I, uh..

07:41.866 --> 07:44.433
No. No.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.100
And you do like women, right?

07:47.166 --> 07:48.866
More than boys, right?

07:48.933 --> 07:50.900
Oh. Yes, of course.

07:50.966 --> 07:52.266
But I've decided to follow

07:52.333 --> 07:55.833
a-a different vocation,
one...not of the flesh.

07:56.933 --> 07:59.600
But we are the flesh, father.

08:02.266 --> 08:04.466
No, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop.

08:04.533 --> 08:07.033
Oh. Okay. I'm sorry.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.833
You're a good man.

08:12.066 --> 08:14.900
But you remind me
of things I wanna forget.

08:16.733 --> 08:18.700
Bad things.

08:22.866 --> 08:24.866
And good things..

08:24.933 --> 08:26.900
...that I can't have anymore.

08:28.933 --> 08:30.333
I'm..

08:32.200 --> 08:34.066
I'm confused.

08:34.133 --> 08:35.600
Oh..

08:35.666 --> 08:37.900
God can help with confusion.

08:38.933 --> 08:41.300
I'll meet God soon enough.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.933
But I won't meet
any other men.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.200
The Bible says,
"It's more blessed

08:47.266 --> 08:49.733
to give than to receive,"
right? Yes?

08:49.800 --> 08:51.733
- Yes, or--
- Yes, yes!

08:52.833 --> 08:56.033
Maybe it's more blessed
to do both.

09:11.166 --> 09:12.300
Guard.

09:13.366 --> 09:14.300
Guard!

09:17.300 --> 09:19.100
I thought leaving Haiti
would do it

09:19.166 --> 09:21.533
working only among men..

09:21.600 --> 09:23.700
...with no temptation, but..

09:26.633 --> 09:28.600
I'm sorry.

09:30.700 --> 09:31.800
I'm sorry.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.933
I'm sorry.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.566
Reverend Jarvis,
I'm sorry to disturb you

09:37.633 --> 09:40.800
but, um, there was an inmate
that you visited last night,

09:40.866 --> 09:44.266
Rodriguez. She requested
another visit now.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.466
Oh, well,
I-I can't right now, Rose.

09:46.533 --> 09:47.900
I have other inmates--

09:47.966 --> 09:49.300
Uh, no, no, no,
but the regulations say

09:49.366 --> 09:51.266
that the inmates
facing executions

09:51.333 --> 09:53.766
have priority, reverend.

09:53.833 --> 09:56.133
I mean, I guess they figure
it's never too late

09:56.200 --> 09:58.533
to, um, save a soul, huh?

10:00.466 --> 10:02.400
You're right, Rose.

10:19.333 --> 10:22.300
Hey, p

10:22.366 --> 10:23.900
Oh, Ms. Vincent.

10:23.966 --> 10:25.766
Hey, good for you.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.800
You gonna come
see me sometime, huh?

10:28.866 --> 10:30.500
You know the rules, Vincent.

10:30.566 --> 10:32.066
Rodriguez is priority.

10:32.133 --> 10:35.533
Oh, stuff it, Ms. Priss!

10:35.600 --> 10:38.100
I just wanted to tell thepa
not to bother, okay?

10:38.166 --> 10:40.133
I'm gonna go to hell anyway.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.266
But that ain't half as bad
as what thisbitch

10:44.333 --> 10:46.233
'next door is gonna get
if I get her.'

10:46.300 --> 10:48.166
'Padre&lt;TO1

10:48.233 --> 10:50.800
'It'd take a miracle
to save her ass. Heh heh heh.'

10:50.866 --> 10:51.900
I'll pray for you--

10:51.966 --> 10:53.900
Oh, pray for yourself!

10:56.500 --> 10:59.700
I wanna go to the infirmary!
The splint's come off!

10:59.766 --> 11:01.800
In a minute, Brenda!

11:05.000 --> 11:06.166
No, don't.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.200
I thought you
wanted to go in.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.100
Alright.

11:12.166 --> 11:13.400
Back!

11:24.833 --> 11:27.233
Come on, sweet thing,
let's move it.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.066
I just wanted to thank you..

11:35.133 --> 11:37.100
...for yesterday.

11:38.266 --> 11:41.033
Boy, was that a big mistake.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.033
That was a sin.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.733
No, James.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.533
That's the best
I've been treated by a man

11:48.600 --> 11:50.733
in a long time.

11:52.500 --> 11:55.333
There is no sin in laughter.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.100
In caring.

11:57.166 --> 11:59.733
In being loved.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.700
And now your God
has given us time

12:02.766 --> 12:04.733
in private.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.166
Oh, God!
Please don't do that.

12:08.233 --> 12:11.366
Violet, this isn't love,
it's weakness.

12:11.433 --> 12:14.066
You're afraid,
you're alone.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.100
Kneel with me and pray.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.066
Pray.

12:19.133 --> 12:22.933
Oh, Lord,
please give us the strength..

12:23.000 --> 12:24.800
I'm not alone, James.

12:24.866 --> 12:27.366
Give us the strength
to rebuke Satan..

12:27.433 --> 12:29.966
Only days before I die

12:30.033 --> 12:32.166
and now I found
what I've been looking for.

12:32.233 --> 12:34.400
...strength
to overcome temptation.

12:34.466 --> 12:37.500
Grant me this
one last wish, James.

12:37.566 --> 12:40.500
The strength to overcome
the weaknesses of the f-f..

12:43.266 --> 12:45.266
Love me, James.

12:45.333 --> 12:46.500
Ah..

12:48.133 --> 12:50.400
I-it's wrong, it's wrong.

12:50.466 --> 12:53.333
It's-it's weakness,
it's, it's..

12:53.400 --> 12:54.533
It's..

13:27.666 --> 13:29.800
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

13:29.866 --> 13:31.300
Worse than Haiti.

13:31.366 --> 13:34.100
You couldn't handle the wealth
of the flesh there, either.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.433
I have..

13:36.500 --> 13:38.933
It was her dying wish.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.166
I have what, James?

13:42.233 --> 13:44.266
You didn't finish your sentence.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.066
You have what?

13:46.133 --> 13:48.000
I've..

13:48.066 --> 13:50.433
...made love to a woman
in my charge.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.866
You..

13:52.933 --> 13:55.933
...fornicated,&lt;col4

13:57.566 --> 14:00.233
I've sinned.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.300
Oh, I want redemption.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.633
Please, give me redemption.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.433
There is no redemption here.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.800
Stand and take your punishment
like a man, Reverend Jarvis.

14:12.866 --> 14:14.800
Like a man, James.

14:14.866 --> 14:18.533
You're coming straight tohe

14:18.600 --> 14:19.900
Redemption.

14:28.733 --> 14:29.800
Guard?

14:31.266 --> 14:32.733
Guard?

14:35.800 --> 14:38.466
'The reverend said
he forgot your appointment'

14:38.533 --> 14:41.666
'at 2 a.m.
How come it wasn't in writing?'

14:41.733 --> 14:44.966
Everything gotta be put
in writing, you know the rules--

14:45.033 --> 14:47.100
Your confession,
Ms. Rodriguez.

14:47.166 --> 14:50.033
Remember you wanted me
to hear your confession.

14:50.100 --> 14:53.000
Oh, yeah, hey, where were you?

14:53.066 --> 14:54.800
I forgot
the damn paperwork, okay?

14:54.866 --> 14:56.700
I got other things on my mind.

14:56.766 --> 14:58.066
Okay, I'm gonna
be down in the hall.

14:58.133 --> 15:00.133
You got three minutes.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.900
Three minutes. That warden
could have my hide for this.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.833
If..

15:22.900 --> 15:24.833
If I helped you escape..

15:25.933 --> 15:27.266
...will you stay with me?

15:27.333 --> 15:28.466
Escape?

15:28.533 --> 15:29.766
Shh, shh..

15:29.833 --> 15:31.333
Tomorrow midnight

15:31.400 --> 15:32.900
at your execution

15:32.966 --> 15:36.866
I'll slip you a capsule with
a milky sap of Haitian root.

15:36.933 --> 15:39.866
It induces a coma-like stage,
you'll look dead

15:39.933 --> 15:41.933
barely a whisper of life.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.300
James, this is crazy.

15:44.366 --> 15:45.433
'Quiet.'

15:45.500 --> 15:47.066
There isn't much time.

15:47.133 --> 15:48.833
Just listen.

15:48.900 --> 15:52.766
Now, the moment the executioner
throws the switch

15:52.833 --> 15:56.366
'you bite the capsule
and fake convulsions.'

15:56.433 --> 15:57.366
You know..

15:58.433 --> 15:59.766
Now..

15:59.833 --> 16:02.066
...I will have cut
the main wire

16:02.133 --> 16:05.000
the day before
to the chair.

16:05.066 --> 16:07.800
'You may be burned
a little by the voltage'

16:07.866 --> 16:09.266
but it won't kill you.

16:09.333 --> 16:11.433
The doctor will think
you're dead.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.366
No sign of life. No pulse.

16:14.433 --> 16:16.333
But they'll bury me.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.500
It's the law.

16:17.566 --> 16:20.966
It's a splendid animation.

16:21.033 --> 16:23.766
You'll be that way for 48 hours.

16:23.833 --> 16:26.100
Then the effect of the
root sample will dissipate

16:26.166 --> 16:28.433
enough time for me
to come and dig you up.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.333
No.

16:30.400 --> 16:32.333
'Please, Violet.'

16:33.100 --> 16:35.400
It's our redemption..

16:36.000 --> 16:38.333
...together.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.566
Do you feel sorry for your
part in the boy's death?

16:41.633 --> 16:42.933
Do you?

16:45.900 --> 16:49.400
For you, James...yes.

16:51.566 --> 16:54.133
But how will I breathe in there?

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Your metabolism slows.

16:57.066 --> 16:58.333
'You won't need much air.'

16:58.400 --> 17:00.800
There isn't much air.

17:00.866 --> 17:02.666
What if I wake early?

17:02.733 --> 17:03.866
How much do I have?

17:03.933 --> 17:05.266
It won't happen,
I'll get you--

17:05.333 --> 17:07.533
How much air?

17:07.600 --> 17:09.766
'About five minutes worth.'

17:09.833 --> 17:11.433
'Once you're fully conscious.'

17:11.500 --> 17:12.966
'Oh.'

17:13.033 --> 17:14.966
'Oh. Alright.'

17:15.033 --> 17:17.533
'James, I'll do it.'

17:48.100 --> 17:49.866
You can save your
Bible thumping.

17:49.933 --> 17:51.366
We're gonna make this right.

17:51.433 --> 17:53.666
She's agreed to marry me.

17:53.733 --> 17:54.933
Marriage?

17:57.133 --> 17:59.800
Marriage is predicated
on trust.

17:59.866 --> 18:02.100
This harlot can't be trusted,
she's a seducer.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.666
Your sin will betray you both.

18:04.733 --> 18:06.900
I've been afraid of this
all my life..

18:07.866 --> 18:09.333
...but now I'm gonna face it

18:09.400 --> 18:10.700
like a man.

18:10.766 --> 18:12.866
A whole man.

18:12.933 --> 18:14.900
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

18:31.433 --> 18:33.200
Oh-h.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.300
My sweet Violet.

18:38.366 --> 18:39.533
Rape.

18:40.766 --> 18:42.633
What?

18:42.700 --> 18:44.633
Help! Ra-a-ape!

18:44.700 --> 18:45.833
Violet, what are you doing

18:45.900 --> 18:47.566
Sorry, James.

18:47.633 --> 18:49.400
But the time it takes
to prosecute you

18:49.466 --> 18:51.433
will buy meat leasta

18:51.500 --> 18:53.466
away from the electric chair.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.566
You said
you wanted to help me.

18:55.633 --> 18:56.766
Just do it.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.233
- Help! Rape!
- Violet, don't.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.600
Please, Violet, please.

19:00.666 --> 19:01.700
Don't. Don't.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.433
Alright, Reverend Jarvis!

19:04.400 --> 19:06.333
'Reverend Jarvis.'

19:07.733 --> 19:10.200
It's almost midnight,
Reverend Jarvis.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.433
Be not afraid, Violet.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.700
The Lord is with you.

19:22.766 --> 19:26.333
There is no power here
that can harm you.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.700
Thank you, father.

20:01.466 --> 20:03.100
She's dead.

20:04.666 --> 20:07.000
Violet should have
had better from life.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.300
'Now it's too late.'

20:09.366 --> 20:11.700
'Oh, it's never too late
for the soul, warden.'

20:14.233 --> 20:16.100
'May I pray at the burial?'

20:16.866 --> 20:17.900
Well, certainly.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.033
Reverend Jarvis..

20:20.100 --> 20:22.066
...you have a request
for your time.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.433
Give me a few hours, Rose.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.433
I-I must supervise
the burial rights.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.100
Sorry, reverend,
it's priority.

20:27.166 --> 20:30.233
The next woman on death row
wants to see you now.

20:30.933 --> 20:32.200
Brenda Vincent.

20:41.366 --> 20:44.000
I, uh, can't stay too long,
Ms. Vincent

20:44.066 --> 20:46.066
I'm, uh..

20:46.133 --> 20:47.166
...due elsewhere.

20:47.233 --> 20:48.533
'I'll bet.'

20:50.633 --> 20:54.133
Can't wait to dig her up
and do it again, huh?

20:56.600 --> 20:58.533
Don't be coy,

20:58.600 --> 21:01.300
I'm a blunt woman
and I got good ears.

21:02.166 --> 21:04.233
'"It's our redemption!'

21:05.066 --> 21:06.533
'Together!"'

21:08.266 --> 21:10.800
Oh, don't worry. I won't tell.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.333
I just want
what you gave Violet.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.533
And I'll give you..

21:21.466 --> 21:23.766
...what she gave you for it.

21:23.833 --> 21:26.400
"Get thee behind me, Satan."

21:26.466 --> 21:29.200
You can't tempt me with lust.

21:29.266 --> 21:31.100
- I love Violet.
- Oh.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.100
You hear me? I love her.

21:34.166 --> 21:36.600
- We're getting married.
- Oh.

21:50.733 --> 21:52.666
Tough

21:54.233 --> 21:56.166
You can't have her.

21:58.166 --> 22:01.600
The worms can have her now.

22:03.466 --> 22:04.466
Violet.

22:04.533 --> 22:05.766
- Oh, my God!
- Wait, reverend.

22:05.833 --> 22:07.400
Oh, my God, I've got to..
Oh, no, the burial.

22:07.466 --> 22:09.600
No, no, no.
We've taken care of it.

22:09.666 --> 22:11.500
No, no, no.
I-I've-I've got to..

22:11.566 --> 22:12.866
What time do you have?

22:12.933 --> 22:15.133
- It's about 1 o'clock.
- 1 o'clock in the afternoon?

22:15.200 --> 22:16.733
- Yes, the afternoon.
- The afternoon, okay.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.333
So what's that? That's, uh,
that's, that's 13 hours.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.500
The execution
was at midnight, so--

22:20.566 --> 22:22.466
That was Friday, James.

22:22.533 --> 22:24.300
This is Sunday.

22:24.366 --> 22:26.700
You took a nasty crack
in the head.

22:26.766 --> 22:28.900
You've been out two days.

22:39.066 --> 22:42.733
'I'm awake! Where are you?'

22:43.766 --> 22:44.733
'Father!'

22:45.766 --> 22:46.933
'Father!'

22:48.900 --> 22:51.033
"Ode To Violet."

22:51.100 --> 22:53.800
"The worms crawl in.
The worms crawl out.

22:53.866 --> 22:55.966
"The worms play pinochle
on your snout.

22:56.033 --> 22:58.066
"One little worm
who isn't so shy

22:58.133 --> 23:00.200
"climbs in your ear
and out your eye.

23:00.266 --> 23:02.533
"Your blood will turn
to pussy green

23:02.600 --> 23:05.033
"and spread it on
like shaving cream.

23:05.100 --> 23:08.133
"Just spread it
on some moldy bread.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.233
"And that's what you eat
when you're dead.

23:10.300 --> 23:12.033
By F. Krueger."

23:15.200 --> 23:18.533
I'm awake. Where are you?

23:18.600 --> 23:20.800
Get me out of here, father!

23:22.533 --> 23:24.733
You find the memories painful,
don't you, Jarvis?

23:28.266 --> 23:29.733
Yes.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.000
Do you want your forgiveness?

23:32.066 --> 23:33.533
Yes.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.566
From the sin of lusting
after a female prisoner

23:36.633 --> 23:38.566
in your charge?

23:38.633 --> 23:39.800
Yes.

23:39.866 --> 23:43.200
From the sin of loving her
with your body?

23:45.066 --> 23:46.433
Yes.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.733
And the sin of conspiring

23:49.700 --> 23:51.500
to help her escape?

23:52.033 --> 23:54.066
Yes! Yes.

23:54.133 --> 23:57.433
And the sin of drugging her
to fake her death

23:57.500 --> 24:02.233
and fooling the authorities
into burying her alive?

24:02.300 --> 24:05.933
Oh, yes, please, please, yes.

24:08.833 --> 24:10.766
And the sin
of not digging her up

24:10.833 --> 24:12.500
as you promised?

24:12.566 --> 24:14.633
Oh, I.. It was..

24:14.700 --> 24:17.333
But, you know, it,
it could have worked. Really.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.633
It, it could've.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.333
But you didn't get there
in time, did you?

24:24.433 --> 24:28.100
'Your lust led Violet
to a terrible death.'

24:29.366 --> 24:31.766
'Slow suffocation.'

24:31.833 --> 24:34.900
'Alone in a coffin
buried under the earth.'

24:36.066 --> 24:37.600
I'm awake!

24:37.666 --> 24:39.866
Where are you?

24:39.933 --> 24:42.033
Get me out of here, father!

24:43.200 --> 24:44.700
Jarvis!

24:44.766 --> 24:46.900
You think Violet
forgives you for that?

24:47.800 --> 24:49.766
Stop it.

24:49.833 --> 24:51.133
Stop it.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.266
Your penance..

24:53.333 --> 24:55.300
...is to stay in here.

24:57.133 --> 24:58.600
Forever.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.466
'Alone.'

25:02.533 --> 25:04.233
'With her memories.'

25:05.233 --> 25:07.933
Watching her die..

25:08.000 --> 25:10.100
...again..

25:10.166 --> 25:13.400
...and again, and again

25:13.466 --> 25:19.400
and again,
and again, and again..

25:20.966 --> 25:25.400
'James, my love,
I hate to hear you cry.'

25:26.533 --> 25:29.333
Violet. Thank God.

25:30.133 --> 25:33.633
You're, you, you're alive.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.600
It was all a dream.

25:36.333 --> 25:38.633
All a bad, bad dream.

25:39.533 --> 25:41.133
No, James.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.933
I am dead

25:43.000 --> 25:45.933
but my soul is stuck.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.700
I can't move on.

25:47.766 --> 25:49.800
Can you ever forgive me?

25:49.866 --> 25:51.333
Yes, James

25:51.400 --> 25:53.633
because I know you love me

25:53.700 --> 25:55.600
but I need your help.

25:55.666 --> 25:57.466
What can I do?

25:57.533 --> 25:59.233
It's Brenda.

25:59.300 --> 26:02.500
I need her forgiveness
for killing her cousin.

26:02.566 --> 26:05.933
I can't move on
unless she forgives me.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.900
Brenda?

26:07.966 --> 26:12.000
But Brenda's gonna die tomorrow
in the electric chair.

26:12.066 --> 26:14.066
How-how can I help?

26:14.133 --> 26:17.700
Yes, but you're
the chaplain, my love.

26:18.566 --> 26:20.533
See her.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.566
Talk to her.

26:22.633 --> 26:25.033
Convince her.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.733
Make her!

26:38.166 --> 26:40.500
Forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.000
Yes, my son.

26:42.066 --> 26:43.433
I killed 11 kids.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.266
I murdered 43 adults.

26:45.333 --> 26:49.700
I wasted 7 cats, 43 dog...
and a canary.

26:49.766 --> 26:51.300
Is that all, my son?

26:51.366 --> 26:53.800
Let's see now,
is it all, uh..

26:55.466 --> 26:59.033
No, uh, I also
wasted a priest.

26:59.100 --> 27:02.066
What was that last one,
my son?

27:03.133 --> 27:06.133
I said, I killed a priest.

27:09.500 --> 27:10.733
Revenge!

27:10.800 --> 27:12.933
That's mine!

27:13.000 --> 27:16.666
Then you're...satisfied
with your revenge?

27:16.733 --> 27:18.766
Satisfied?

27:18.833 --> 27:21.533
Oh, yeah.
She's dead, right?

27:21.600 --> 27:25.833
Well, all is not...
quite forgiven.

27:27.766 --> 27:29.033
Uh, save your breath,&lt;TO2

27:29.100 --> 27:31.700
I don't need any of that
where I'm goin'.

27:31.766 --> 27:34.433
Maybe not, but Violet does.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.400
Can you find it in your heart

27:38.466 --> 27:40.833
to forgive her for your cousin?

27:40.900 --> 27:42.500
No way!

27:42.566 --> 27:44.500
She's gonna rot in hell
for that!

27:44.566 --> 27:48.600
Brenda, she needs
your forgiveness.

27:48.666 --> 27:49.966
Needs?

27:50.033 --> 27:52.000
She don't need nothin' now.

27:52.066 --> 27:54.166
She's worm food.

27:54.233 --> 27:56.466
What do you know
of the afterlife?

27:56.533 --> 27:58.933
How many Theology classes
have you taken?

27:59.566 --> 28:01.066
What is this?

28:01.133 --> 28:04.000
You got five seconds
before I whistle for the warden.

28:04.066 --> 28:07.766
I'm dying tomorrow,&lt;
and I wanna look right for it.

28:07.833 --> 28:11.333
You know, hair, nails.
Big day in a girl's life.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.100
Will you forgive Violet
by then?

28:13.166 --> 28:15.500
Read my lips!

28:15.566 --> 28:17.700
She got what was comin' to her.

28:17.766 --> 28:19.066
Now, if this is it,
I'm outta here.

28:19.133 --> 28:21.100
No. No, no, wait.

28:23.566 --> 28:24.533
Wait.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.533
You want a way
to beat the chair?

28:32.000 --> 28:35.533
What do you mean, uh,
about that medicine from Haiti?

28:35.600 --> 28:37.766
Yeah, who wouldn't?

28:37.833 --> 28:39.633
I can give you that.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.466
The drug will make you
appear dead.

28:41.533 --> 28:43.066
I'll rewire the chair.

28:43.133 --> 28:47.000
Afterward...I'll dig you up.

28:47.066 --> 28:49.700
Yeah, or you could leave me
stuck in the grave like Violet.

28:49.766 --> 28:52.200
No air?
No, thanks,

28:52.266 --> 28:54.233
You have my word.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.800
You shall have life.

28:59.566 --> 29:01.733
You must be nuts.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.733
Why the hell would you
wanna do that?

29:03.800 --> 29:05.833
Violet would want it that way.

29:05.900 --> 29:07.366
She was truly good.

29:07.433 --> 29:09.400
Yeah, a regular saint.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.866
And what do you want?

29:12.933 --> 29:14.900
To make Violet happy.

29:15.566 --> 29:17.900
Yeah, right.

29:21.566 --> 29:23.666
I mean..

29:23.733 --> 29:25.833
...what do you want from me?

29:26.700 --> 29:27.833
Hmm?

29:29.466 --> 29:31.033
I mean..

29:31.100 --> 29:33.033
...it's a little tough to.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.533
...give you what Violet did.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.733
I mean, in here.

29:42.600 --> 29:45.133
All I want is for you to live.

29:48.666 --> 29:50.600
For Violet.

30:56.733 --> 30:58.433
She's dead.

31:12.800 --> 31:15.300
Good, you're awake.
Right on time.

31:28.500 --> 31:30.433
Son of a bitch.

31:31.366 --> 31:33.633
You really dug me up.

31:33.700 --> 31:36.866
I gave you my word.
Ha ha ha.

31:36.933 --> 31:39.133
I wanted to keep you alive

31:40.400 --> 31:42.266
Everything worked

31:42.333 --> 31:44.400
just as it would've
with Violet.

31:46.966 --> 31:48.700
Where the hell am I?

31:48.766 --> 31:51.600
Solitary confinement, baby!

31:52.833 --> 31:55.633
This ain't solitary.
I've been there.

31:55.700 --> 31:57.800
Oh, no, not the new wing, no.
This is the old wing.

31:57.866 --> 31:59.466
They sealed it off
about 20 years ago

31:59.533 --> 32:00.566
after that court decision

32:00.633 --> 32:03.533
'about cruel
and unusual punishment.'

32:03.600 --> 32:06.500
'It seems too many people
went insane in here.'

32:07.733 --> 32:09.700
Could've died from the stink.

32:11.866 --> 32:16.033
So...when do I get out?

32:16.100 --> 32:18.100
God wants you to forgive Violet.

32:20.100 --> 32:22.300
I want you to forgive Violet.

32:30.366 --> 32:33.000
Violet wants you
to forgive Violet.

32:34.033 --> 32:35.033
Oh..

32:36.733 --> 32:38.233
'Oh, no!'

32:39.000 --> 32:40.800
No-o-o!

32:47.166 --> 32:49.566
Reverend Jarvis.

32:49.633 --> 32:51.066
This is Jake Johnson.

32:51.133 --> 32:53.433
He's come
for Brenda Vincent's things.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.966
He's her, uh..

32:56.033 --> 32:57.466
...next of kin.

32:57.533 --> 32:59.800
Yeah. Pleased.

32:59.866 --> 33:02.300
We had one of them, uh,
living together arrangements.

33:02.366 --> 33:05.333
Well, let me offer
my condolences, Mr. Johnson.

33:05.400 --> 33:07.866
Why? Living together
wasn't that bad.

33:07.933 --> 33:10.266
Of course, we didn't get much
sack time with her in the stir

33:10.333 --> 33:12.433
but we had memories.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.733
I understand.

33:14.966 --> 33:16.900
You mind if I ask you
a personal question?

33:16.966 --> 33:19.766
No, no, uh, I suppose not.

33:19.833 --> 33:22.433
How do you get
a gig like this, huh?

33:22.500 --> 33:25.866
One guy, lots of broads.

33:25.933 --> 33:28.600
'Hey, you didn't do no messing
with Brenda, did you?'

33:28.666 --> 33:31.400
'No offense, it's a joke.'

33:31.466 --> 33:33.966
Just lightenin' the mood a bit.

33:34.033 --> 33:35.000
Oh.

33:37.366 --> 33:39.300
Brenda's personal effects.

33:42.966 --> 33:44.866
- Well, this is it?
- Uh, yes.

33:44.933 --> 33:47.433
- No key?
- Key?

33:47.500 --> 33:50.166
You know, to a car or a house.

33:50.233 --> 33:52.333
Or a safety deposit box?

33:52.400 --> 33:54.866
No, there was no key,
this is all of it.

33:54.933 --> 33:57.500
'It's not much
for an entire life, Mr. Johnson'

33:57.566 --> 33:59.800
'but a life
such as Brenda lead, uh..'

34:02.166 --> 34:04.800
Perhaps, we could
talk about Brenda's loss.

34:04.866 --> 34:06.500
One of the jobs
of a prison chaplain

34:06.566 --> 34:09.800
is to sometimes share grief.

34:09.866 --> 34:12.466
Go ahead.

34:12.533 --> 34:16.800
Sometimes...grief
is hard to talk about.

34:18.566 --> 34:20.533
Yeah, you're probably right.

34:22.700 --> 34:25.433
But I got some time, so..

34:25.500 --> 34:27.433
...you just
get it off your chest.

34:36.966 --> 34:39.233
Where the hell have you been?

34:40.433 --> 34:43.200
'You can't keep me here
like this.'

34:44.033 --> 34:45.833
I need&lt;i

34:45.900 --> 34:48.233
I need&lt;i

34:48.300 --> 34:49.800
So how you doin'? Hmm?

34:49.866 --> 34:52.166
You two getting along alright?

34:52.233 --> 34:54.400
Gettin' along?

34:56.100 --> 34:57.300
Like family.

34:57.366 --> 34:58.833
Oh, wonderful.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.900
Hey, how about you, Violet

35:00.966 --> 35:04.033
Did she, uh, she forgive you?

35:04.100 --> 35:05.600
I did. I did.

35:05.666 --> 35:07.566
You wanna hear?

35:07.633 --> 35:09.433
I forgive you, Violet.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.600
My cousin was scum anyway.

35:11.666 --> 35:13.200
He deserved it.

35:13.266 --> 35:14.833
Oh, that's great.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.466
Just great.

35:16.533 --> 35:19.233
A contrition is very,
very important for some.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.500
You were so right.

35:25.566 --> 35:28.233
'Forgiveness has set me free.'

35:29.266 --> 35:31.833
And thank you, Brenda.

35:31.900 --> 35:35.733
Maybe in seven or eight weeks,
I'll forgive you.

35:36.700 --> 35:37.833
Hey!

35:39.833 --> 35:41.233
Come back here!

35:42.100 --> 35:44.500
You can't leave me here!

35:44.566 --> 35:46.533
I did my part of the bargain!

35:47.533 --> 35:49.633
You gotta let me go!

35:57.300 --> 35:59.133
You know..

35:59.200 --> 36:01.200
...you can't leave me here
like this.

36:01.966 --> 36:02.966
I'll die.

36:03.033 --> 36:04.933
I had no intension
of leaving you here.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.766
Oh, great.

36:09.033 --> 36:11.966
Look, um...I forgave her.

36:12.033 --> 36:13.166
Excuse me.

36:13.233 --> 36:14.433
Honest.

36:16.466 --> 36:19.800
I forgive her
now and forever for her sins.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.433
I mean..

36:23.500 --> 36:25.000
...look at me.

36:25.066 --> 36:27.533
I'm talking like I know
the Bible and stuff.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.866
Well, thanks, Brenda.

36:28.933 --> 36:31.333
I knew I could count on you
to do the right thing.

36:36.700 --> 36:37.833
Now that I've been
the instrument

36:37.900 --> 36:41.300
of Violet's redemption,
I can leave to God the task

36:41.366 --> 36:43.333
of punishing you.

36:45.533 --> 36:46.700
Airtight.

36:46.766 --> 36:48.700
'It's so much larger
than Violet's.'

36:48.766 --> 36:51.433
You probably have what,
three, four hours

36:51.500 --> 36:52.600
of air in here.

36:52.666 --> 36:54.600
'If you breathe shallow.'

36:59.633 --> 37:00.633
No.

37:02.100 --> 37:05.100
No! No!

37:08.133 --> 37:11.200
- 'Death certificate, James?'
- 'Yeah.'

37:11.266 --> 37:13.133
Look, it's over, okay?

37:13.200 --> 37:15.766
So leave me alone, will you?

37:15.833 --> 37:19.166
Violet's been forgiven and
the wicked have been punished.

37:19.233 --> 37:21.500
- 'They have?'
- Mm-hmm.

37:21.566 --> 37:23.533
All of the wicked?

37:25.633 --> 37:26.600
Why?

37:27.533 --> 37:29.600
Did not the Lord say..

37:30.833 --> 37:32.833
"...Vengeance is mine?"

37:32.900 --> 37:35.100
Oh, he's got his vengeance

37:35.166 --> 37:37.200
The-the murderers
have been punished.

37:37.266 --> 37:40.166
Not all the murderers, padre

37:40.233 --> 37:42.833
Not the murderer
who is responsible for this.

37:44.566 --> 37:48.100
'I'm awake. Where are you?'

37:48.166 --> 37:50.633
Oh, uh, I'm not responsible.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.300
I'm an instrument
of the Lord's will.

37:53.366 --> 37:56.033
'Get me out of here, father!'

37:56.100 --> 37:58.033
Could you lower that a little?

37:58.100 --> 37:59.533
No, James.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.633
You're gonna wake everybody up.

38:01.700 --> 38:04.466
God decreed that she
be executed by the state

38:04.533 --> 38:06.533
in a legally prescribed manner.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.933
You thwarted God's will and now
you're committing murder.

38:10.933 --> 38:13.700
No! No, no.
God wanted her dead.

38:13.766 --> 38:16.433
I'm the instrument
of his will!

38:16.500 --> 38:17.900
Murder!

38:19.200 --> 38:21.800
Listen to the sounds
of your victim

38:21.866 --> 38:23.866
and know that they
will follow you

38:23.933 --> 38:26.233
for the rest of your life.

38:27.833 --> 38:29.766
No-o-o!

38:29.833 --> 38:31.800
No. No!

38:36.066 --> 38:38.133
Oh, my God.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.600
What have I done?

38:39.666 --> 38:41.600
What have I done?

38:41.666 --> 38:43.800
- Reverend.
- Warden, excuse me.

38:43.866 --> 38:45.400
Wait, where are you off to
in such a hurry?

38:45.466 --> 38:47.366
The men's wing. I've been
neglecting my duties--

38:47.433 --> 38:49.100
Oh, well,
I've got great news.

38:49.166 --> 38:52.100
Sister Ilene is back tomorrow
to take over the women's wing.

38:52.166 --> 38:54.566
Now, I, I know you
haven't complained

38:54.633 --> 38:56.366
but I can tell you've..

38:56.433 --> 38:57.833
...you've had a tough job.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.133
There's so much more work to do.
Excuse me.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.500
The state
has authorized funding

39:02.566 --> 39:04.766
for a whole new
office complex

39:04.833 --> 39:08.800
including chaplain's quarters
and a new chaplain.

39:08.866 --> 39:11.233
Oh, wonderful,
but I-I must get--

39:11.300 --> 39:13.766
See, the architect has faxed
the plans over here.

39:13.833 --> 39:15.933
The construction
begins in three months.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.833
We're gonna reopen and renovate
the old solitary wing.

39:24.900 --> 39:26.700
Brenda, it's okay,
I'm here for you.

39:26.766 --> 39:28.166
I'll be right with you.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.833
Now you hold on.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.333
Hold on.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.366
'I can't kill you.'

39:42.433 --> 39:44.233
And I can't let you go.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.533
And I-I sure as hell
can't keep you here.

39:47.566 --> 39:49.766
Look, how come
you can't let me go?

39:49.833 --> 39:51.300
I won't talk.

39:51.366 --> 39:54.100
And if I show up alive,
they'll only kill me again

39:54.166 --> 39:56.166
You know, I could get away
and hide out.

39:56.233 --> 39:57.300
Honest!

39:58.000 --> 39:59.733
Look, I got money, okay?

39:59.800 --> 40:01.400
Jake and I held up
a savings and loan.

40:01.466 --> 40:02.866
I could call Jake,
tell him where it is

40:02.933 --> 40:05.166
he could bring it down here,
I'd give you half

40:05.233 --> 40:06.600
'and you could get away too.'

40:06.666 --> 40:08.233
I can't get away,
I deserve to be punished.

40:08.300 --> 40:11.133
Okay. Oh, God. Okay.

40:11.633 --> 40:13.233
Okay.

40:13.300 --> 40:16.233
But me, man.
I've been through a lot, okay?

40:18.233 --> 40:19.700
I got another idea.

40:19.766 --> 40:21.100
'You could take some money'

40:21.166 --> 40:23.066
'and do something good
in Violet's name.'

40:23.133 --> 40:25.566
You know, like,
uh, a scholarship.

40:25.633 --> 40:27.133
A donation.

40:27.200 --> 40:29.166
- For the neighborhood.
- Atonement?

40:29.233 --> 40:30.900
'Yeah, right.'

40:30.966 --> 40:32.900
What you said,
in Violet's name.

40:32.966 --> 40:34.966
You know, it makes up
for all the bad stuff.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.833
And you could walk too.

40:36.900 --> 40:39.366
You know, you've paid your debt
through Violet.

40:39.433 --> 40:41.700
'You gotta call Jake.'

40:41.766 --> 40:44.000
Yeah, but is Jake
gonna understand all this?

40:44.066 --> 40:45.766
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

40:45.833 --> 40:47.466
He's real understanding.

40:47.533 --> 40:49.266
Look, uh, you know

40:49.333 --> 40:51.100
go get the warden's
portable phone, okay?

40:51.166 --> 40:53.066
'Bring it back in here,
I'll call Jake'

40:53.133 --> 40:54.900
'you can listen
to the whole thing.'

40:54.966 --> 40:58.266
You know, I swear,
I won't double-cross you.

40:58.333 --> 41:00.833
I swear it, okay?

41:02.233 --> 41:05.400
'You can keep me here
until you get the box, okay?'

41:05.466 --> 41:07.433
Come on.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.500
You gotta call Jake!

41:10.333 --> 41:11.500
Please.

41:11.566 --> 41:15.333
Jake, oh, Jake, baby, it's me.

41:15.400 --> 41:16.566
It's a long story, honey, okay?

41:16.633 --> 41:18.166
But I cut a deal.

41:18.233 --> 41:21.033
No, not with the devil,
with the prison chaplain!

41:21.100 --> 41:24.266
Look, you gotta get the money.
Look, okay..

41:24.333 --> 41:25.733
Oh, baby,
you didn't think I'd die

41:25.800 --> 41:27.500
without you gettin'
your cut, did ya?

41:27.566 --> 41:28.900
Look, I'm gonna tell you
where it is, okay?

41:28.966 --> 41:30.566
And I want you to pick it up,
bring it here, and take it

41:30.633 --> 41:32.966
behind that loading dock,
behind the prison, okay?

41:33.033 --> 41:34.900
And give it to him!

41:48.900 --> 41:50.566
I thought
you were comin' alone.

41:50.633 --> 41:54.566
Hey, no sweat, preacher, that's
Maggie, she's copacetic.

41:54.633 --> 41:55.800
'You could have fooled me,
you know.'

41:55.866 --> 41:58.233
'I took you for a pea-brained
Bible-thumper.'

41:58.966 --> 42:00.633
What a scam artist.

42:00.700 --> 42:02.333
So you were pokin'
Brenda, huh?

42:02.400 --> 42:03.933
Did you bring the money?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.600
Keep your pants on.
Where's Brenda?

42:06.666 --> 42:08.866
She told you she's well-hidden,
but she's safe.

42:08.933 --> 42:12.100
You get her as soon as I get
the money. You have my word.

42:12.166 --> 42:13.766
And you're the only one
who knows where she's hidden?

42:13.833 --> 42:15.100
Yeah, right.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.233
And she can't
get away or nothing?

42:16.300 --> 42:18.833
- She's chained.
- Chained?

42:18.900 --> 42:21.433
Nice touch.

42:21.500 --> 42:24.033
They won't find her
if I don't tell them.

42:24.100 --> 42:25.666
This isn't a very safe place.

42:25.733 --> 42:27.700
We might be seen.
Is that it?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.933
I got your payoff.

42:36.700 --> 42:38.366
What?

42:38.433 --> 42:40.433
What is this?

42:40.500 --> 42:42.433
You'll never get Brenda back.

42:42.500 --> 42:46.166
Did you take a good look
at Maggie, Mr. Preacher?

42:46.233 --> 42:48.266
'Why would I want
an old re-tread like Brenda'

42:48.333 --> 42:50.633
'if I got a young babe
like that?'

42:50.700 --> 42:52.733
'See, I was only hangin' around
with my tongue out'

42:52.800 --> 42:54.733
''cause only Brenda knew
where she hid the money.'

42:55.700 --> 42:57.466
Now I got it.

42:57.533 --> 42:58.966
And you got Brenda
hidden away so good

42:59.033 --> 43:01.033
no one's ever gonna find her.

43:01.966 --> 43:03.433
Sounds like a sweet deal to me.

43:03.500 --> 43:05.300
No, wait! Wait!

43:05.366 --> 43:07.400
Look, Brenda loves you!

43:07.466 --> 43:09.233
Hmm, that's sweet.

43:09.300 --> 43:11.833
But Maggie deserves
my undivided attention.

43:13.100 --> 43:14.033
'So listen..'

43:14.933 --> 43:16.866
...you ever been to Cleveland?

43:16.933 --> 43:18.400
Cleveland?

43:18.466 --> 43:20.466
No. Why?

43:20.533 --> 43:22.100
Just asking.

43:47.300 --> 43:48.233
Padre?

43:51.966 --> 43:53.933
Is that you?

43:54.866 --> 43:57.200
Come back,&lt;TO

44:00.100 --> 44:01.700
Come on.

44:06.266 --> 44:09.833
I kept my part of the deal.

44:13.666 --> 44:16.433
Let me out no-o-ow.

44:20.866 --> 44:22.033
Violet?

44:24.033 --> 44:25.333
Honey?

44:28.800 --> 44:31.733
Make him let me out.

44:36.166 --> 44:37.333
You know, I really thought

44:37.400 --> 44:39.533
Brenda was gonna make it
to three months

44:39.600 --> 44:42.600
till the construction crew came.

44:42.666 --> 44:45.366
That's the trouble
with government.

44:45.433 --> 44:47.366
You can get buried in paperwork.
