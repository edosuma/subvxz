00:20.040 --> 00:23.150
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.150 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are

00:27.490 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.220 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:57.340 --> 02:00.100
<b>Right now, I'm letting you live.</b>

02:01.300 --> 02:05.040
<b>Until you've grown enough

02:11.970 --> 02:13.550
<b>I'll only take it back</b>

02:13.550 --> 02:17.440
<b>when you're able to punch me

<b>Gon was humiliated,</b>

02:33.360 --> 02:37.340
<b>after Hisoka recovered the tags 
taken by Gerreta.</b>

02:39.580 --> 02:41.760
<b>As for Killua...</b>

02:44.880 --> 02:46.680
<b>You're wasting your time.</b>

02:46.680 --> 02:49.980
<b>I'll never give you an opening to attack.</b>

03:00.740 --> 03:03.100
<b><i>I am a very cautious man.</i></b>

03:03.100 --> 03:05.530
<b><i>I go to any lengths necessary,</i></b>

03:05.530 --> 03:08.040
<b><i>even when facing a child.</i></b>

03:08.040 --> 03:12.170
<b><i>Once he exhausts himself,

03:12.640 --> 03:13.830
<b><i>I'll attack!</i></b>

03:17.460 --> 03:19.970

<b>Man...</b>

03:23.940 --> 03:26.070
<b>If you're not gonna show yourself,

03:26.070 --> 03:27.060
<b>Huh?</b>

03:28.410 --> 03:30.560
<b>What a pain...</b>

03:30.560 --> 03:34.060
<b>You're only worth one point to me.</b>

03:38.800 --> 03:40.190
<b><i>He wants to fight?</i></b>

03:40.780 --> 03:42.420
<b><i>I can't possibly lose, right?</i></b>

03:42.420 --> 03:44.950
<b><i>He's just a kid.</i></b>

03:45.830 --> 03:47.180
<b><i>But...</i></b>

03:48.260 --> 03:50.620
<b><i>Why is he so calm?</i></b>

03:50.620 --> 03:52.710
<b><i>Is he really that strong?</i></b>

03:54.390 --> 03:58.180
<b><i>Right... I am a very cautious man.</i></b>

03:58.180 --> 03:59.710
<b><i>I should escaâ€”</i></b>

03:59.710 --> 04:01.760

04:02.330 --> 04:03.130
<b><i>But...</i></b>

04:04.460 --> 04:07.660
<b><i>My brothers will yell at me!</i></b>

04:07.660 --> 04:11.960
<b><i>Actually, if I go back without

04:11.960 --> 04:14.140
<b><i>they'll definitely yell at me!</i></b>

04:16.190 --> 04:17.400
<b>Bro!</b>

04:19.230 --> 04:21.520
<b>We ran into some trouble.</b>

04:21.520 --> 04:23.660
<b>You're done, right?</b>

04:34.150 --> 04:35.940
<b>You idiot!</b>

04:36.230 --> 04:38.790
<b>You can't even beat a little kid?</b>

04:39.420 --> 04:41.690
<b>Y-You got it wrong, Amo!</b>

04:41.690 --> 04:43.300
<b>What do I have wrong?</b>

04:43.600 --> 04:46.970
<b>I-I didn't want to hurt a little kid.</b>

04:46.970 --> 04:49.740
<b>So I figured I'd take it while he slept.</b>

04:49.740 --> 04:51.180
<b>You're lying through your teeth!</b>

04:51.550 --> 04:53.430
<b>F-Fine!</b>

04:53.960 --> 04:57.530
<b>If you insist, that leaves me no choice.</b>

04:57.530 --> 04:59.190
<b>Time for a beat down.</b>

05:03.880 --> 05:06.210
<b><i>If I start to lose,</i></b>

05:06.210 --> 05:09.450
<b><i>my brothers will come to my aid.</i></b>

05:13.570 --> 05:14.990
<b>Hey, kid.</b>

05:14.990 --> 05:16.710
<b>Just give me your tag.</b>

05:17.470 --> 05:20.020
<b>Do as I say, and I won't hurt you.</b>

05:21.090 --> 05:22.210
<b>Stupid.</b>

05:29.070 --> 05:31.330
<b>Aw, don't say I didn't warn you.</b>

05:31.780 --> 05:33.520
<b>Right in the gut.</b>

05:33.520 --> 05:35.600
<b>Must hurt like a bitch.</b>

05:39.980 --> 05:40.980
<b>Huh?</b>

05:41.500 --> 05:42.720
<b>What?</b>

05:42.720 --> 05:44.460
<b>Did you go easy on him?</b>

05:44.460 --> 05:46.780
<b>You're too nice, Imori.</b>

05:46.780 --> 05:48.610
<b>Y-Yeah...</b>

05:50.460 --> 05:52.620
<b>#198, huh?</b>

05:52.620 --> 05:54.150
<b>What? No way...</b>

05:56.500 --> 06:00.010
<b>Since it's only a number off 
from the one I'm after,</b>

06:00.010 --> 06:04.250
<b>maybe #199 is one of your two buddies?</b>

06:09.460 --> 06:10.480
<b>Umori...</b>

06:10.960 --> 06:11.950
<b>Yeah.</b>

06:12.510 --> 06:14.010
<b>Get in formation.</b>

06:14.010 --> 06:14.930
<b>Time to get serious.</b>

06:16.550 --> 06:20.270
<b>This is no ordinary kid.</b>

06:40.870 --> 06:44.310
<b><i>It doesn't matter how strong he is.</i></b>

06:44.310 --> 06:47.420
<b><i>He stands no chance 
against our teamwork.</i></b>

06:48.100 --> 06:49.950
<b><i>We three have</i></b>

06:49.950 --> 06:53.430
<b><i>defeated many tough opponents 
with this formation.</i></b>

06:54.110 --> 06:55.700
<b><i>Just you wait...</i></b>

06:55.700 --> 06:58.180
<b><i>We're gonna rip you to shreds.</i></b>

07:08.660 --> 07:09.950
<b>A-Above?</b>

07:14.460 --> 07:15.680
<b>Don't move.</b>

07:16.380 --> 07:19.710
<b>My fingers are sharper than knives.</b>

07:26.050 --> 07:27.210
<b>Huh?</b>

07:27.460 --> 07:30.250
<b>You're #197?</b>

07:30.660 --> 07:34.780
<b>I'm so bad at guessing these things...</b>

07:34.780 --> 07:35.600
<b>Hey.</b>

07:36.140 --> 07:37.850
<b>Are you #199?</b>

07:38.680 --> 07:39.970
<b>Yeah...</b>

07:39.970 --> 07:40.940
<b>Hand it over.</b>

07:46.840 --> 07:47.790
<b>Thanks.</b>

07:48.410 --> 07:51.240
<b>Now, for the tags I don't need...</b>

08:05.940 --> 08:07.630
<b>And the other one goes this way.</b>

08:14.960 --> 08:16.570
<b>You still have three days.</b>

08:16.570 --> 08:18.330
<b>Good luck finding them.</b>

08:18.850 --> 08:19.800
<b>See ya.</b>

08:24.850 --> 08:26.350
<b>Damn it!</b>

08:46.860 --> 08:52.510
<b>#197 was always accompanied by #199...</b>

08:53.060 --> 08:57.600
<b>I didn't expect that little kid to 
deal with them for me.</b>

08:57.600 --> 09:00.260
<b>Good thing I was watching 
from the shadows.</b>

09:00.710 --> 09:03.750
<b>Made it easy to grab the tag I wanted...</b>

09:14.080 --> 09:18.530
<b>The kid noticed I was there...</b>

09:21.800 --> 09:22.970
<b>I've failed...</b>

09:27.920 --> 09:31.050
<b>Man, that was boring.</b>

09:32.000 --> 09:35.310
<b>Wonder what Gon's doing.</b>

09:37.070 --> 09:47.140
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

09:43.100 --> 09:47.140
<b>Too Bad</b>

10:04.150 --> 10:06.010
<b>Six days have passed.</b>

10:06.660 --> 10:08.370
<b>Only one day left...</b>

10:08.850 --> 10:11.850
<b>It's been four days since 
we ran into Hisoka.</b>

10:11.850 --> 10:13.990
<b>And we haven't seen anyone else.</b>

10:17.730 --> 10:20.350
<b>Wanna head back to the starting point?</b>

10:21.580 --> 10:25.310
<b>It's possible that people have 
already finished.</b>

10:25.310 --> 10:27.840
<b>No, we won't find anyone there.</b>

10:28.860 --> 10:32.270
<b>This phase is unique because</b>

10:32.270 --> 10:36.190
<b>you have a chance to recover 
your tag if you lose it.</b>

10:36.560 --> 10:37.860
<b>On the other hand,</b>

10:37.860 --> 10:40.300
<b>you might have six points 
in tags right now.</b>

10:40.300 --> 10:43.290
<b>But that doesn't guarantee you'll have 
them when the phase ends.</b>

10:43.920 --> 10:46.160
<b>You can't finish it early.</b>

10:47.440 --> 10:48.660
<b>I see.</b>

10:48.660 --> 10:51.460
<b>But it's worth a shot.</b>

10:52.070 --> 10:53.770
<b>Only one day remains.</b>

10:53.770 --> 10:56.800
<b>People who already have six points</b>

10:56.800 --> 11:01.430
<b>will be inclined to wait near the goal.</b>

11:02.160 --> 11:03.970
<b>I would do the same.</b>

11:07.240 --> 11:09.520
<b>Okay, let's go.</b>

11:27.780 --> 11:30.380
<b>Well? Anyone there?</b>

11:30.380 --> 11:31.500
<b>No...</b>

11:31.900 --> 11:35.580
<b>No one that can be easily spotted.</b>

11:35.580 --> 11:37.120
<b>Damn...</b>

11:37.120 --> 11:39.980
<b>Perhaps we should split up to search,</b>

11:39.980 --> 11:43.190
<b>after we decide on a time and 
place to reconvene.</b>

11:44.240 --> 11:47.390
<b>It'll go faster with three people.</b>

11:49.410 --> 11:50.370
<b>Gon!</b>

11:50.750 --> 11:53.600
<b>I guess we all had the same idea.</b>

11:53.600 --> 11:57.620
<b>I've been watching from up above, 
and a number of people are nearby.</b>

11:57.620 --> 11:58.780
<b>Really?</b>

11:58.780 --> 12:01.710
<b>I see... We should search from above.</b>

12:01.710 --> 12:03.140
<b>That won't work.</b>

12:03.140 --> 12:06.490
<b>It's only possible if you have eyes 
as sharp as Gon's.</b>

12:07.550 --> 12:08.360
<b>Gon.</b>

12:08.360 --> 12:09.070
<b>Huh?</b>

12:09.070 --> 12:11.320
<b>Do you have the tags you need?</b>

12:12.850 --> 12:14.990
<b>Yeah, I guess...</b>

12:15.470 --> 12:19.740
<b>Damn, so I'm the only one 
without enough points.</b>

12:19.740 --> 12:21.900
<b>Who's your target?</b>

12:21.900 --> 12:24.890
<b>#246, a woman named Ponzu.</b>

12:25.240 --> 12:29.260
<b>I heard that she uses chemical weapons.</b>

12:29.590 --> 12:33.530
<b>Gon, did you see any women 
when you were up there?</b>

12:33.820 --> 12:35.200
<b>Nope.</b>

12:35.200 --> 12:36.310
<b>I see.</b>

12:37.240 --> 12:40.280
<b>We can assume that there 
are four possibilities.</b>

12:40.800 --> 12:43.260
<b>She's in good shape, 
and she still has her tag.</b>

12:43.580 --> 12:46.730
<b>She's in good shape, 
but she's lost her tag.</b>

12:46.730 --> 12:49.750
<b>She's out of action, 
but she still has her tag.</b>

12:50.240 --> 12:52.990
<b>She's out of action, 
and she doesn't have her tag.</b>

12:53.490 --> 12:54.790
<b>Is it really likely</b>

12:54.790 --> 12:57.680
<b>that she'd still have her tag 
if she's out of action?</b>

12:58.040 --> 13:00.890
<b>If she were caught in a sudden accident,</b>

13:00.890 --> 13:05.800
<b>or if she were defeated after 
hiding the tag.</b>

13:06.110 --> 13:08.860
<b>If she died after concealing her tag,</b>

13:08.860 --> 13:13.420
<b>we won't be able to find it.</b>

13:14.340 --> 13:17.260
<b>Sounding grimmer by the second.</b>

13:17.260 --> 13:20.400
<b>Hey, do you know anything 
else about Ponzu?</b>

13:20.740 --> 13:22.060
<b>Does she wear a special perfume,</b>

13:22.060 --> 13:24.310
<b>like Leorio with his cologne?</b>

13:25.000 --> 13:26.610
<b>Oh, that's right.</b>

13:26.610 --> 13:29.360
<b>Gon can follow her scent!</b>

13:29.360 --> 13:33.280
<b>But she might not wear perfume.</b>

13:33.280 --> 13:34.720
<b>He can smell the chemicals she uses.</b>

13:35.410 --> 13:38.670
<b>She's known for using drugs, right?</b>

13:39.060 --> 13:43.020
<b>Some of them must have strong scents.</b>

13:43.020 --> 13:44.250
<b>Well, Gon?</b>

13:44.250 --> 13:45.920
<b>Okay, I'll give it a shot.</b>

13:46.940 --> 13:48.990
<b>That's why I'm here.</b>

15:20.240 --> 15:22.000
<b>Is she in there, Gon?</b>

15:22.000 --> 15:24.350
<b>Yep, definitely.</b>

15:25.970 --> 15:27.210
<b>What do you want to do?</b>

15:27.210 --> 15:29.150
<b>I'm going inside.</b>

15:30.160 --> 15:32.410
<b>You guys, wait here.</b>

16:03.330 --> 16:05.690
<b><i>There don't appear to be any traps.</i></b>

16:07.830 --> 16:09.440
<b>I'll head inside.</b>

16:09.900 --> 16:13.360
<b>Don't enter until I give the okay.</b>

16:13.360 --> 16:14.440
<b>Thirty minutes.</b>

16:14.440 --> 16:14.950
<b>Huh?</b>

16:15.300 --> 16:18.030
<b>If we don't hear anything from you 
after thirty minutes,</b>

16:18.030 --> 16:19.170
<b>we're coming in.</b>

16:19.170 --> 16:19.720
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:19.720 --> 16:20.700
<b>Unacceptable.</b>

16:21.070 --> 16:24.000
<b>If that happens, you guys 
should return to the start.</b>

16:24.000 --> 16:25.710
<b>I can't do that.</b>

16:25.710 --> 16:27.800
<b>Since we've teamed up,</b>

16:27.800 --> 16:30.140
<b>I won't abandon you now.</b>

16:32.110 --> 16:34.470
<b>Then I quit the team.</b>

16:34.890 --> 16:37.660
<b>It's selfish, considering all the 
help you've given me,</b>

16:37.660 --> 16:39.450
<b>but I'll do this alone.</b>

16:40.810 --> 16:41.820
<b>No.</b>

16:42.820 --> 16:44.510
<b>What did you say?!</b>

16:44.510 --> 16:46.610
<b>We're staying here, no matter 
what you say.</b>

16:47.990 --> 16:50.540
<b>Still got a problem?</b>

16:57.090 --> 16:58.660
<b>Do whatever you want.</b>

17:04.220 --> 17:05.960
<b>Hold onto that for me.</b>

17:25.310 --> 17:27.860
<b><i>I have to go for it...</i></b>

17:54.070 --> 17:55.760
<b>Isn't that...</b>

17:55.760 --> 17:57.110
<b>Bourbon?</b>

17:57.110 --> 17:58.510
<b>I'm guessing that</b>

17:59.640 --> 18:02.430
<b>I'm your target?</b>

18:02.430 --> 18:03.700
<b>Ponzu!</b>

18:04.220 --> 18:05.540
<b>There's no point.</b>

18:06.540 --> 18:09.420
<b>We gain nothing by fighting here.</b>

18:09.420 --> 18:11.210
<b>I have everything to gain.</b>

18:11.210 --> 18:14.170
<b>It's just as you said...</b>

18:14.170 --> 18:16.240
<b>You're my target!</b>

18:17.130 --> 18:19.780
<b>Let's pretend that a miracle occurs,</b>

18:19.780 --> 18:21.530
<b>and you defeat me.</b>

18:22.280 --> 18:24.540
<b>You still won't be able 
to leave this cave.</b>

18:24.910 --> 18:26.060
<b>What?</b>

18:27.050 --> 18:28.920
<b>What do you mean?</b>

18:46.320 --> 18:47.810
<b>He's taking too long.</b>

18:48.290 --> 18:50.540
<b>Is Leorio okay?</b>

18:51.100 --> 18:52.310
<b>Yeah.</b>

18:52.690 --> 18:55.510
<b>It's been nearly thirty minutes.</b>

18:57.050 --> 18:58.320
<b>Kurapika! Gon!</b>

18:58.850 --> 18:59.570
<b>Don't come in!</b>

19:07.460 --> 19:08.580
<b>Leorio!</b>

19:20.040 --> 19:21.080
<b>Leorio!</b>

19:22.680 --> 19:24.300
<b>You fools...</b>

19:24.300 --> 19:27.600
<b>Why did you enter the cave?</b>

19:29.000 --> 19:30.480
<b><i>He has bites all over his body!</i></b>

19:30.730 --> 19:32.100
<b><i>If those snakes were venomous...</i></b>

19:32.450 --> 19:34.000
<b>They're vipers.</b>

19:34.000 --> 19:36.740
<b>Their poison isn't that strong.</b>

19:36.740 --> 19:38.860
<b>But he's been bitten 
too many times!</b>

19:43.590 --> 19:45.250
<b>S-Stop it!</b>

19:45.250 --> 19:49.200
<b>If you have any cavities or 
open wounds in your mouth...</b>

19:49.200 --> 19:50.480
<b>No problem!</b>

19:51.480 --> 19:54.200
<b>Leorio, do you have any 
serums in here?</b>

19:54.880 --> 19:55.820
<b>If I did,</b>

19:56.980 --> 20:02.680
<b>I could have saved you guys...</b>

20:04.700 --> 20:05.810
<b>Leorio!</b>

20:05.810 --> 20:07.240
<b>Anyway, we have to stop the bleeding.</b>

20:07.240 --> 20:08.140
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

20:13.330 --> 20:14.720
<b>That should do it.</b>

20:14.720 --> 20:16.480
<b>We need to take him to a doctor!</b>

20:21.780 --> 20:23.320
<b>I would stop if I were you.</b>

20:24.640 --> 20:26.910
<b>You cannot leave.</b>

20:27.310 --> 20:28.830
<b>What do you mean?</b>

20:28.830 --> 20:33.950
<b>When someone tries to exit this cave,</b>

20:37.680 --> 20:39.920
<b>snakes attack them.</b>

20:43.370 --> 20:46.240
<b>Bourbon, the snake charmer, 
set this trap.</b>

20:47.350 --> 20:48.880
<b>If you're bitten,</b>

20:49.430 --> 20:53.190
<b>you'll end up paralyzed like he is.</b>

20:53.600 --> 20:55.480
<b>And then you'll die.</b>

20:59.270 --> 21:00.320
<b>Bourbon!</b>

21:00.320 --> 21:03.130
<b>You're looking for tags, right?</b>

21:03.130 --> 21:04.950
<b>We'll give you every tag 
in our possession.</b>

21:04.950 --> 21:07.190
<b>So let us out of here!</b>

21:07.790 --> 21:08.700
<b>It's no use.</b>

21:10.610 --> 21:13.380
<b>He's already dead.</b>

21:20.050 --> 21:23.140
<b>D-Dead?</b>

21:34.020 --> 21:36.810
<b>Gon and his friends have 
been caught in Bourbon</b>

21:36.810 --> 21:39.230
<b>the snake charmer's trap, 
and can't leave the cave.</b>

21:41.730 --> 21:43.480
<b>Will they pass the Hunter Exam?</b>

21:44.280 --> 21:49.120
<b>Will Leorio survive the 
venomous snake bites?</b>

23:28.330 --> 23:30.900
<b>Next time: Big x Time x Interview!</b>

23:30.900 --> 23:32.640
<b>Thank you, Kurapika.</b>

23:32.640 --> 23:34.310
<b>Thank you, Gon.</b>
