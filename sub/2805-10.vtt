A decoder lens. It doesn't work on ours.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.901
Because it's a copy. So what's the plan?

00:25.984 --> 00:28.195
Leverage the decoder
for the evidence tape.

-Depends on Peter.

Can we talk?

03:03.851 --> 03:06.228
-What's on your mind?
-Well, I was gonna ask you the same thing.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.396
I'm fine.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.857
Yeah, sure, you're fine,
until I mention Caffrey's name.

Then you look like you want to
punch a hole through the wall.

-Not to anyone else here,

I have a few loose ends here
that need tying up.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.860
I'm all for tying up loose ends,
as long as they aren't Caffrey.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.906
Look, Peter, you…

03:59.907 --> 04:01.700
You always take responsibility for him,

04:02.951 --> 04:05.621
but maybe it's time he starts
taking responsibility for himself.

-His words?
-More or less.

04:22.137 --> 04:26.350
I'm guessing more, but you're not wearing
handcuffs and an orange onesie.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.559
That means something.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.478
That means he doesn't want to
go back to prison.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.813
Yet he blames you for his freedom.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.483
He can't see past the fact
that the law was broken.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.070
Irony has seldom been more perverse.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.783

Today, it ends with him.

04:47.538 --> 04:48.664

-In a safe place.

not today.

12:14.443 --> 12:17.029
Legend has it that the Masons
entrusted Mosconi

12:17.112 --> 12:18.780
with something of great value.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.367
He ensured its safety by hiding it
shortly before he left this country,

12:22.784 --> 12:24.745
but not without leaving a trail.

12:25.037 --> 12:28.707
Those hues that you identified
are the beginning of that trail.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.793
Thirteen is a sacred number
for the Masons.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.672
He never referenced it
in any other work but one.

12:36.215 --> 12:38.008
The <i>Codex.</i>

12:38.091 --> 12:39.760
Chapter 13.

12:39.843 --> 12:43.472
-So, what's the pot of gold?
-You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.556
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

12:49.019 --> 12:50.395
It's Peter. We've got a case.

12:50.479 --> 12:53.273
-Agent Burke can wait.
-I don't think you get it.

12:53.524 --> 12:55.359
If I don't show up, Peter gets suspicious.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.277
If he gets suspicious,
he checks my anklet,

12:57.361 --> 12:59.530
which leads him right here.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.866
Fine, but your friend stays. Any…

13:02.950 --> 13:04.910
I want to talk to her before I leave.

13:06.036 --> 13:07.704
I'll stand right here
until you hand me the phone.

13:17.923 --> 13:20.008
Rebecca, it's me. It's Neal.

13:21.343 --> 13:22.594
(INAUDIBLE)

13:24.930 --> 13:27.266
-I can't hear her.
-She can hear you.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.852
-And that's good enough.
-Listen to me.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.645
I'm coming for you. It's gonna be okay.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.980
I'm gonna get you out of there. Just…

13:33.981 --> 13:35.732
Bad form to keep a lady waiting.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.693
Hurry along to Agent Burke.

13:38.527 --> 13:41.488
I'll have this all figured out
before you get back.

13:41.572 --> 13:42.948
Just go.

13:45.909 --> 13:49.037
If anything happens to her or him,

13:50.998 --> 13:52.082
you'll see what I'm capable of.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.096
PETER: Tell me what you see.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.391
A lot of people,

14:09.600 --> 14:11.393
but I'm sure we'll find Waldo
in there somewhere.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.645
I'm not in the mood for levity.

14:13.729 --> 14:15.689
Well, then, let's not waste any time.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.649
-You have someplace else to be?
-(SIGHS)

14:17.733 --> 14:19.651
You rang, I came. Is there a problem?

14:19.735 --> 14:21.862
-Your tone, for starters.
-Insubordinate?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.572
Edgy. What's going on?

14:23.655 --> 14:25.073
Of course I'm edgy.

14:25.157 --> 14:28.535
You're upset with me, and I have no idea
what I can do or say to make it right.

14:28.619 --> 14:30.162
-(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
-Just do your job.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.415
-Mr. Rawling, you're the house manager?
-You must be Agent Burke.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.209
This is my colleague Neal Caffrey.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.711
-NEAL: How are you?
-Is this the piece in question?

14:37.920 --> 14:40.589
<i>A Vision of the Last Judgment</i>
by William Blake,

14:40.672 --> 14:42.591
thought to have been lost
for over 200 years.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.426
How did it come to your auction house?

14:44.510 --> 14:45.969
-Anonymous seller.
-Ah.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.679
I'd have called us as well.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.974
Of course, gentlemen, I do have
the information for the seller,

14:51.058 --> 14:54.811
but I can't provide it until the painting
has been proven inauthentic.

14:54.895 --> 14:58.524
You don't want to upset the vendor
and risk your commission. Understandable.

14:58.607 --> 14:59.983
Neal?

15:00.067 --> 15:02.778
Okay. Let's see what we see.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.627
Tracing sheets won't help.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.879
Anything placed between the page
and the glass

15:20.963 --> 15:23.173
distorts the concealed image.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.842
Tell me something useful.

15:25.717 --> 15:26.927
Okay.

15:27.010 --> 15:31.056
Um… There's a certain tigerfish
that's been known to eat crocodiles.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.017
You are an odd little creature.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.936
Yeah, and you're a stock thug.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.855
You can't even do your own dirty work.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.607
Your obvious weakness is your hubris.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.192
You speak with such authority.

15:42.276 --> 15:43.944
I've dealt with guys like you before.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.989
Then you know we have big teeth
and very little patience.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.658
Stay focused.

15:51.869 --> 15:54.246
There's a hidden image on each page.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.707
It looks like it's from
some ancient language.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.252
Trace the images.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.590
What, paint directly on Mosconi's pages?

16:04.756 --> 16:06.967
We need to line them up
so we can see the bigger picture.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.219
You'll destroy the original Chapter 13.

16:09.303 --> 16:11.930
Is it so difficult for you
to take a leap of faith?

16:12.222 --> 16:16.643
I reserve my leaps of faith
for space exploration and the Chupacabra.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.691
I thought you were the artist.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.903
Show me what you can do.

16:26.862 --> 16:29.072
NEAL: Oil and tempera paints
are aged perfectly,

16:30.032 --> 16:31.950
mixed with just the right amount of chalk.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.869
If it's a forgery, it's a good one.

16:34.536 --> 16:35.954
Monotype processing.

16:36.914 --> 16:38.832
Initially inked on a non-absorbent…

16:41.335 --> 16:42.711
What is it?

16:50.886 --> 16:52.721
PETER: The initials "C.H."

16:54.223 --> 16:55.599
Curtis Hagen.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.936
We're going after the Dutchman again.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.286
I want everything that you can dig up
on Hagen since his release.

17:16.787 --> 17:18.914
Where he's staying,
who he's associated with,

17:18.997 --> 17:21.792
what he is having for dinner.
I mean everything.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.043
Yeah, on my way.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.003
(BEEPS)

17:25.087 --> 17:28.215
I didn't think Hagen would slip up
so soon, but I guess he did.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.675
Yeah, but why use the same MO

17:29.758 --> 17:31.426
that landed him in prison
in the first place?

17:31.510 --> 17:32.845
It could be something
he pulled out of storage

17:32.928 --> 17:34.388
for a quick payday.

17:37.015 --> 17:38.892
-The information on the seller.
-Thank you.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.394
"Douglas Nemon."

17:41.019 --> 17:42.771
Obviously, an alias Hagen's using.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.482
No known residence, but we have a PO box,

17:45.566 --> 17:47.025
and we have a telephone number.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.610
Do you have any buyers lined up?

17:48.694 --> 17:49.862
-Several.
-Good.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.488
The FBI is about to become one of them.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.073
You have a plan?

17:53.156 --> 17:56.869
We clear the art as authentic,
let the sale of the piece go through,

17:56.952 --> 17:58.287
and track the money back to Hagen.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.290
Could work.

18:01.665 --> 18:03.458
Mr. Rawling, grab whatever you need.

18:03.542 --> 18:04.877
You're gonna come back
to the Bureau with me

18:04.960 --> 18:06.920
so we can put this transaction in motion.

18:09.882 --> 18:11.842
(SIGHS) All right, we finished here?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.012
-When I say we are.
-Look, I did my part.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.848
-Why don't you want to see this through?
-Honestly?

18:18.098 --> 18:20.309
I don't like you looking at me
as some kind of liability.

18:20.392 --> 18:21.518
All I did was help you.

18:21.852 --> 18:23.687
At a cost I'm not comfortable with.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.397
Well, more comfortable than a prison cell.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.441
-Watch it.
-I did what you couldn't.

18:27.524 --> 18:28.984
-What?
-You heard me.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.946
You took a system I believe in
and corrupted it.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.823
Because that system didn't believe in you.

18:34.907 --> 18:37.326
Don't say another word.
Now, we are finished here.

18:37.409 --> 18:38.702
Go home.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.747
-Mr. Rawling, you ready?
-You bet.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.332
Let's go.

18:54.343 --> 18:55.344
(CREAKING)

18:59.556 --> 19:00.807
Nice cigars.

19:01.141 --> 19:04.144
You know, it's bad luck to celebrate
before a job is finished.

19:04.478 --> 19:07.481
You like this? Nicaraguan Imperiales.

19:07.731 --> 19:08.941
Great with scotch.

19:09.399 --> 19:13.278
When this is over,
you light up a stogie and release Rebecca?

19:13.362 --> 19:14.821
Just like that?

19:14.905 --> 19:16.615
-I said I would.
-And Neal?

19:17.950 --> 19:19.701
He served his purpose.

19:20.827 --> 19:25.165
"A wise man does not waste
so good a commodity as lying for naught."

19:25.999 --> 19:27.501
I'm flattered you think me wise.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.294
I was referring to Neal.

19:30.087 --> 19:32.339
When this is over,
he's gonna make you pay,

19:32.422 --> 19:33.799
and you won't even know it's happening.

19:33.966 --> 19:35.676
I'm not that easily fooled.

19:35.759 --> 19:36.802
(SCOFFS)

19:36.885 --> 19:38.720
I know more about you than you think.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.807
Well, I know a little about you, too.

19:42.558 --> 19:44.810
Huh, about me? Yeah, good luck.

19:44.977 --> 19:47.938
I think Theodore Winters
would need the luck.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.022
Don't you?

19:54.403 --> 19:57.197
I know your name. Do you know mine?

19:59.867 --> 20:01.243
Moz, you all right?

20:01.410 --> 20:03.328
Yeah, I'm okay for now.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.038
So is Rebecca.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.125
What was the pressing matter?

20:08.834 --> 20:11.336
You're getting what you want.
How much longer do you need to keep her?

20:11.420 --> 20:12.713
You didn't answer my question.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.257
It's a forgery investigation.

20:15.841 --> 20:18.552
Second-rate hack trying to sell
a Vermeer knock-off to the Met.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.970
Amateur hour.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.847
Let me talk to Rebecca.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.267
I swear, I didn't say anything to Peter.
Now, let me talk to her.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.351
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

20:26.435 --> 20:27.561
Excuse me.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.481
By all means, carry on.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.904
Hello? Yes. Of course.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.822
All right. Keep working on the pages.

20:38.906 --> 20:40.866
Pretend you're explaining
the process to me.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.743
Was it really a forgery case?

20:42.826 --> 20:45.495
Yeah, except the artist was Hagen.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.873
-What?
-He put a piece on the market.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.791
They found his signature hidden in it.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.127
Why risk selling a fake now?

20:52.211 --> 20:54.171
I don't know, probably to raise capital.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.215
He can't fund a treasure hunt
on unemployment.

20:56.798 --> 20:58.008
Something isn't right.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.801
Yeah, starting with the timing.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.346
And the signature? He's smarter than that.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.765
Maybe this is all part of his plan.

21:05.349 --> 21:07.059
I have no idea,

21:07.142 --> 21:09.353
but he can't know the FBI is after him.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.979
Yeah, he'll think you sold him out.

21:11.063 --> 21:12.606
That's not good for Rebecca.

21:12.689 --> 21:15.275
Well, you'll need ears and eyes
on the Suit's investigation.

21:15.359 --> 21:16.860
All taken care of.

21:16.944 --> 21:18.946
You still have that earwig?

21:29.248 --> 21:30.249
That's a fast turnaround.

21:30.958 --> 21:33.669
We've had some very enthusiastic bidders.

21:33.752 --> 21:35.170
CURTIS HAGEN: <i>What was the going price?</i>

21:35.254 --> 21:37.005
950,000.

21:37.089 --> 21:38.423
<i>That's good.</i>

21:38.966 --> 21:41.134
<i>I assume you still have</i>
<i>my account number.</i>

21:41.218 --> 21:44.137
Once we finalize the paperwork,
the money will be transferred to you.

21:44.221 --> 21:45.806
Thank you very much.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.434
JONES: <i>Got nothing on the cell trace.</i>
PETER: <i>Well, we still have the account.</i>

21:49.518 --> 21:53.313
Let's have someone from tech
ready to engineer a false transaction.

21:53.397 --> 21:56.567
Mr. Rawling, we're gonna need you
to give a statement to one of our agents.

21:56.650 --> 21:59.111
It may take some time. If you would.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.869
How many more pages?

22:07.035 --> 22:08.120
Two.

22:09.913 --> 22:10.914
Now one.

22:10.998 --> 22:14.835
Neal, if you'd be so kind
as to apply the finishing touch.

22:15.836 --> 22:17.337
-Why?
-Ceremony.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.214
And because I said so.

22:30.851 --> 22:34.021
Hagen may have his bases covered
when it comes to the phone,

22:34.104 --> 22:36.481
<i>but we'll see how good</i>
<i>he really is in a minute.</i>

22:36.565 --> 22:38.901
-If this doesn't work?
-It'll work.

22:39.985 --> 22:41.737
We might need Caffrey after all.

22:41.820 --> 22:42.988
I mean, we may have the tech,

22:43.071 --> 22:44.364
<i>but he knows how</i>
<i>someone like Hagen thinks,</i>

22:44.448 --> 22:45.908
<i>what his next move could be.</i>

22:45.991 --> 22:48.160
I won't let Hagen make another move.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.953
Jones, I thought about what you said,

22:50.037 --> 22:53.165
about how Neal needs to take
responsibility for himself.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.417
-Yeah.
-You're right.

22:55.584 --> 22:56.919
I need to keep a distance.

22:57.294 --> 23:00.172
So why did you take Neal
to the auction house in the first place?

23:00.255 --> 23:01.840
That was a mistake.

23:04.092 --> 23:05.886
Listen, I wanted to ask you earlier.

23:05.969 --> 23:08.430
What happens to Neal when you leave?

23:08.680 --> 23:10.390
He's the next ASAC's problem.

23:11.934 --> 23:13.143
-You know, because I could…
-Jones.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.396
Don't volunteer to take him on.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.357
Trust me. You'll regret it.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.819
<i>Come on. Let's see if our setup's ready.</i>

23:23.904 --> 23:25.197
Something wrong?

23:25.280 --> 23:26.615
Almost finished.

23:29.952 --> 23:31.328
It's done.

23:36.959 --> 23:38.460
This isn't like the other ones.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.671
So I'm guessing that's the pot of gold?

23:42.089 --> 23:44.675
Let's see how we get there.

23:52.266 --> 23:54.601
I've never seen this language before.

23:54.935 --> 23:55.978
Neither have I.

23:56.562 --> 23:59.982
That's why your next task is going to be
to translate it for me.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.943
That could take days, weeks, maybe.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.403
Rebecca doesn't have that time.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.071
Better get a move on.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.036
We're not doing this.

24:13.871 --> 24:15.163
You have any ideas?

24:16.248 --> 24:17.958
-PETER: <i>Got something.</i>
-Hang on.

24:19.668 --> 24:23.380
This is a real-time link to
the IP activity on Hagen's account,

24:23.463 --> 24:25.299
courtesy of our friends downstairs.

24:25.924 --> 24:28.635
Money for the forgery was
transferred two minutes ago.

24:28.719 --> 24:31.180
Strong signal this time.
Doesn't look like there's any re-routing.

24:31.263 --> 24:32.306
I knew he wouldn't want to wait.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.057
JONES: <i>He had to check on his money.</i>

24:34.141 --> 24:37.019
PETER: <i>There's only one computer logging</i>
<i>in to that account at the moment,</i>

24:37.102 --> 24:38.478
and it's right here in New York.

24:38.562 --> 24:40.272
We got him. Downtown Brooklyn.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.316
PETER: <i>Assemble a team and move out.</i>

24:42.399 --> 24:44.109
The FBI's on the way.

24:44.193 --> 24:45.736
Never my favorite words.

24:45.819 --> 24:48.113
If they grab Hagen,
I may never see her again, Moz.

24:48.197 --> 24:49.823
There's gotta be a play here.

24:59.917 --> 25:01.543
I think I just found it.

25:01.919 --> 25:04.922
All right, take a look at the pages,
a good look.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.215
<i>Rain Man</i> it.

25:14.264 --> 25:15.390
-I got it.
-You got it?

25:15.474 --> 25:16.892
-Yeah.
-Good.

25:22.940 --> 25:25.317
-What are you doing?
-Take one more step and I drop it.

25:27.861 --> 25:28.904
You're bluffing.

25:29.530 --> 25:31.448
You drop that lighter,
and she's as good as gone.

25:31.532 --> 25:32.991
Yeah, so is the <i>Codex.</i>

25:33.075 --> 25:35.869
It's your choice, you release Rebecca
or watch everything you work for

25:35.953 --> 25:37.079
go up in smoke.

25:40.457 --> 25:41.959
What's it gonna be?

25:49.633 --> 25:50.759
We need to talk about this.

25:50.843 --> 25:53.679
You have five seconds to decide
how important this message is.

25:53.929 --> 25:56.515
We may have forgotten to mention
that the FBI is en route.

25:57.558 --> 25:59.518
-You are…
-A particular kind of bastard?

25:59.601 --> 26:00.936
Yeah, I heard that one before.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.062
Three seconds.

26:02.813 --> 26:03.939
-Two seconds.
-Stop.

26:04.022 --> 26:05.065
One!

26:06.900 --> 26:09.444
Call whoever you need to call,
and make it fast. I want her out of there.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.243
Let her go.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.127
Put her on the line.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.087
Give her the phone.

26:29.173 --> 26:30.465
-Rebecca?
<i>-I'm here, Neal.</i>

26:30.549 --> 26:32.676
All right, listen to me.
Wherever you are, you run.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.554
-Get to a populated area. You understand?
<i>-I'm going.</i>

26:35.637 --> 26:37.431
Just keep moving
and stay on the line, okay?

26:37.598 --> 26:39.099
<i>-Okay.</i>
-All right.

26:43.437 --> 26:44.563
Satisfied?

26:47.399 --> 26:48.483
Not quite.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.695
Here's a striking image for you.

26:53.864 --> 26:55.032
Back exit.

27:00.037 --> 27:01.955
We can cut over to Sixth, hit the bridge.

27:02.039 --> 27:04.833
This time of day, we can be there
in 10, 15 minutes tops.

27:04.917 --> 27:06.543
NYPD can get there faster.

27:06.627 --> 27:08.712
Already coordinated.
We'll have their eyes.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.714
But the arrest belongs to us.

27:10.881 --> 27:13.467
I'm not letting Hagen get away
with another technicality.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.802
So I'm assuming
you don't want to tell Caffrey.

27:15.886 --> 27:17.638
He'll know when he needs to know.

27:17.721 --> 27:20.599
In the meantime, have someone
from the Bureau pull his tracking data.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.518
All right, you think he's up to something?

27:22.601 --> 27:24.937
Told him to go home.
Want to make sure he did.

27:27.272 --> 27:28.899
Rebecca, where are you?

27:29.399 --> 27:31.235
I think I'm somewhere in Brooklyn.

27:31.568 --> 27:33.070
Neal, we have to go now.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.447
All right, hold on. You have it, right?

27:35.531 --> 27:38.992
Every symbol safely stored here.
I am the <i>Codex</i> now.

27:39.076 --> 27:40.327
I need you to get a safe house ready.

27:40.410 --> 27:42.996
We need a secure place to hole up
in case Hagen comes after us.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.207
-And you?
-Just call me when you're done.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.668
All right, I'm still here.
I'm still with you.

27:48.168 --> 27:49.461
Is anyone following you?

27:50.087 --> 27:52.756
I'm not sure. Maybe. I don't know.

27:52.840 --> 27:54.842
I'm not hanging up
until I know you're safe.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.927
I'll only feel safe when I'm with you.

27:57.010 --> 27:59.221
All right, what are your cross streets?
What do you see?

28:00.639 --> 28:02.015
Kent and Flushing?

28:02.099 --> 28:03.350
Neal, I'm scared.

28:03.851 --> 28:05.686
I'm on Taylor right near the park.

28:05.769 --> 28:07.062
I'm coming to you.

28:07.688 --> 28:08.856
I'm passing Hall Street.

28:08.939 --> 28:10.566
Do you see anyone behind you?

28:11.984 --> 28:14.027
Lots of people. I don't know.

28:14.111 --> 28:16.113
All right, I'm almost at Flushing.

28:18.407 --> 28:21.243
-All right, I'm turning toward you now.
-I'm still here.

28:21.952 --> 28:23.078
I'm still here, too.

28:44.850 --> 28:46.602
-Thank God.
-It's okay.

28:47.186 --> 28:48.395
It's okay. I'm still here.

28:48.896 --> 28:50.272
-You okay?
-Yeah.

28:50.564 --> 28:51.982
-You sure?
-Yeah.

29:03.744 --> 29:04.995
Agent Burke, is your team ready?

29:05.078 --> 29:06.622
-Yes, sir.
-I'll take point.

29:06.705 --> 29:07.831
Let's move in.

29:07.915 --> 29:08.916
That's a go.

29:36.610 --> 29:38.070
FBI.

29:38.904 --> 29:41.031
Hands where I can see them.

29:41.865 --> 29:43.033
Agent Burke.

29:43.909 --> 29:45.786
We have so much to discuss.

29:55.295 --> 29:58.298
-Are you sure it's safe to be here?
-It's only temporary.

29:58.382 --> 30:02.135
Moz is gonna find a safe place for you
to stay until this whole thing blows over.

30:02.845 --> 30:05.138
Rebecca, it's time to end this.

30:05.597 --> 30:07.349
-What? You mean tell the FBI?
-Yeah.

30:07.432 --> 30:10.227
No. No way. You'll get into trouble.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.397
Look, we started this together.

30:13.856 --> 30:15.148
And now, you wanna finish it?

30:15.607 --> 30:17.818
-Tell me what you found.
-(SIGHING)

30:18.569 --> 30:20.988
Well, all the pages held hidden symbols,

30:21.071 --> 30:24.283
symbols that added up
to some kind of message

30:24.366 --> 30:26.118
culminating with a picture of an idol.

30:26.201 --> 30:27.202
Describe the idol.

30:27.828 --> 30:29.413
It was Hindu, female.

30:30.372 --> 30:32.541
-Did she have a crown?
-Yeah.

30:34.918 --> 30:36.336
What are you thinking?

30:43.886 --> 30:45.846
-Is this what you saw?
-Yes.

30:46.054 --> 30:48.557
This is the idol of Sita, deity of wealth.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.642
-It was created centuries ago.
-I've heard about it.

30:50.726 --> 30:52.561
The idol had eyes
made out of rare diamonds.

30:52.895 --> 30:54.688
But over the years, the idol vanished.

30:54.771 --> 30:56.648
And only one of the diamonds
was ever recovered.

30:56.732 --> 30:59.526
A stone which is now sitting
in the Smithsonian.

31:00.819 --> 31:01.904
The Hope Diamond.

31:02.946 --> 31:03.947
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

31:04.531 --> 31:06.366
We're looking for its twin.

31:06.617 --> 31:09.870
The other eye, the other diamond,
it could be right here in New York.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.955
Yeah, Hagen said
the Masons entrusted Mosconi

31:12.039 --> 31:13.457
with something of great value.

31:13.540 --> 31:15.125
There's a lot of gap years
in the history of the idol.

31:15.209 --> 31:17.628
So it's possible the Masons
had it at some point.

31:18.003 --> 31:20.714
That diamond is a good reason
for Hagen to go to all this trouble.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.050
It's a good reason for you
to decode those symbols you found.

31:23.383 --> 31:25.427
-Where are the pages?
-(SIGHS)

31:26.595 --> 31:27.846
The <i>Codex</i> is gone.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.140
To save you, I had to destroy it.

31:30.224 --> 31:31.725
-There's still a way we…
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

31:35.270 --> 31:37.981
-You have a safe house?
-What I have is bad news.

31:38.065 --> 31:40.526
The FBI's got Curtis Hagen in custody.

31:40.943 --> 31:43.111
-How do you know?
-I heard it through the earwig.

31:43.904 --> 31:45.322
If he tells Peter there's footage of me

31:45.405 --> 31:47.115
taking those coins,
it sets off a chain reaction

31:47.199 --> 31:48.784
that lands us all behind bars.

31:48.867 --> 31:49.993
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

31:50.077 --> 31:52.287
Anything I can to make sure
that doesn't happen.

31:52.579 --> 31:53.872
What is it?

31:53.956 --> 31:55.457
I have to leave.

31:57.918 --> 32:00.295
I'll be back. I promise.

32:00.587 --> 32:01.880
Be careful.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.345
Recognize this?

32:10.639 --> 32:11.932
William Blake, if I'm not mistaken.

32:12.599 --> 32:14.601
Judgment Day. Pretty fitting.

32:15.060 --> 32:17.437
More like rush-to-judgment day.

32:18.188 --> 32:19.815
The painting's a fake.

32:20.816 --> 32:22.901
You've no proof that it's mine.

32:23.110 --> 32:24.361
I wouldn't be so sure.

32:32.119 --> 32:35.163
Why would I do something that bold?

32:35.956 --> 32:40.169
Well, I think that you got out of prison,
had that piece ready to go,

32:40.252 --> 32:42.296
and decided to make some quick cash.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.840
What, ride off into the sunset?
Is that it?

32:44.923 --> 32:45.924
You tell me.

32:47.759 --> 32:49.094
It's too rudimentary.

32:49.720 --> 32:53.390
Criminals aren't that complicated,
and if I remember correctly,

32:53.473 --> 32:55.893
I caught you the first time
because of your ego.

32:55.976 --> 32:57.519
Maybe prison humbled me.

32:57.936 --> 33:00.564
I doubt it. People like you don't change.

33:07.446 --> 33:08.989
Heard we got Hagen.

33:09.281 --> 33:10.908
Stay at your desk.

33:11.909 --> 33:15.037
I didn't sign this painting.

33:15.204 --> 33:16.413
You saying you were framed?

33:17.039 --> 33:18.999
Say that was the case.

33:19.082 --> 33:21.627
Now, we have to think, who did it?

33:22.336 --> 33:24.713
Had to be someone who knew me,
had to be someone who knew

33:24.796 --> 33:26.965
that I used to sign my work.

33:27.508 --> 33:29.092
That'd be anyone in this division.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.930
Someone in this division

33:33.013 --> 33:35.849
who has an affinity for art forgery.

33:35.933 --> 33:37.267
Neal?

33:37.809 --> 33:38.936
You're lying.

33:40.312 --> 33:41.313
(SCOFFS)

33:42.981 --> 33:44.483
What if I made you an offer?

33:45.192 --> 33:46.527
I'll take a confession.

33:46.902 --> 33:50.364
I have something to show you,
your eyes only, my place.

33:51.448 --> 33:52.908
This conversation's over.

33:52.991 --> 33:56.036
You can bring all the people you want,
all the backup you need,

33:56.119 --> 33:58.705
but you're gonna want to keep
this strictly between us.

33:59.998 --> 34:01.542
Peter. A moment?

34:05.838 --> 34:07.756
I checked Caffrey's tracking data.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.884
You're not gonna like it, especially when
you look at the time stamp.

34:10.968 --> 34:12.177
What is it?

34:12.928 --> 34:15.597
He was with Hagen all afternoon.

34:22.437 --> 34:23.772
-NEAL: Peter…
-Save it.

34:23.856 --> 34:25.816
We're all taking a ride.

34:44.626 --> 34:45.961
This is as far as they go.

34:47.296 --> 34:49.464
It's okay. I got it from here.

34:50.132 --> 34:51.717
This better be worth my time.

34:51.925 --> 34:54.052
-It's worth more than that.
-Really? What's that?

34:54.136 --> 34:56.013
-Freedom, Agent Burke.
-All right, stop.

34:56.305 --> 34:58.849
Look, this could be a setup.
We don't know what's in there.

34:58.932 --> 35:01.226
-I do, evidence.
-How can you be sure?

35:02.686 --> 35:04.563
I love watching the two of you dance.

35:04.646 --> 35:06.982
-A bit cathartic, really.
-Shut up.

35:07.065 --> 35:09.443
By the way, you're going to prison again.

35:09.526 --> 35:11.737
-I doubt that.
-Keep dreaming.

35:11.904 --> 35:14.198
I have been dreaming of payback,

35:14.531 --> 35:16.742
for the two of you taking away
years of my life.

35:16.992 --> 35:18.368
You did that to yourself.

35:18.744 --> 35:20.621
Now, I'm doing it to you.

35:21.163 --> 35:22.956
-Beg.
-What?

35:23.040 --> 35:24.541
Beg me for your freedom.

Peter, listen to me.
He was threatening Rebecca.

-I didn't have a choice.
-Then you should've told me.

36:08.961 --> 36:10.671
I couldn't take that risk.

36:11.046 --> 36:12.172
What sort of work was it?

36:12.548 --> 36:14.383
Some kind of puzzle
he wanted me to solve.

Look, I'll explain everything later.

What's important
is that Rebecca is safe now.

36:18.887 --> 36:20.597
Why did Hagen bring me here?

36:21.890 --> 36:23.559
Like I said, it could've been a setup.

36:23.892 --> 36:26.186
"Beg me for your freedom?"
What did that mean?

36:26.270 --> 36:28.689
Look, that could mean anything.
He could've been setting me up.

36:28.772 --> 36:30.691
I mean, you heard him. He wanted revenge.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.652
Who did this?
And I swear, if you hold back…

36:33.735 --> 36:35.988
I have no idea who would've taken him out.

36:38.615 --> 36:40.075
Hagen's place has been tossed.

36:40.158 --> 36:43.078
Someone did a pretty thorough sweep
of the apartment, and recently.

36:43.161 --> 36:45.831
Have the team go through it
with a fine-tooth comb.

36:45.914 --> 36:47.040
All right.

36:48.417 --> 36:49.626
Can I see that?

36:49.918 --> 36:52.796
No, personal effects that were on
the victim at the time of the shooting.

36:52.880 --> 36:56.383
My handler's right over there.
I'm not gonna try anything. Please.

36:58.844 --> 37:00.137
Thanks.

37:09.396 --> 37:10.564
I'll be right back.

37:11.982 --> 37:15.819
Call the building manager.
Check Hagen's mail. I want something.

37:15.903 --> 37:17.029
You got it.

37:17.696 --> 37:18.822
Don't think I'm finished with you.

37:18.906 --> 37:20.532
I found this in Hagen's wallet.

37:22.826 --> 37:24.912
"Blue Ground Cafe." It's a coffee shop.

37:26.038 --> 37:28.582
"8154 Linden Avenue."

37:31.126 --> 37:33.462
That's the same block
where we found Siegel's body.

37:33.545 --> 37:35.088
Uh-huh. Check out the back.

37:39.009 --> 37:41.595
Hagen was watching someone all day
and taking notes.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.889
-Could be anybody.
-Could be whoever shot him.

37:52.648 --> 37:55.692
-Barista remembered Hagen.
-Not much else.

37:56.109 --> 37:58.195
All right, Hagen sat right here all day.

37:58.278 --> 37:59.863
He was looking at something.

38:02.950 --> 38:04.326
NEAL: That building across the street?

38:05.077 --> 38:07.037
People moving in and out.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.540
Good vantage point
if you're watching someone.

38:11.959 --> 38:13.377
Noting when they enter…

38:13.752 --> 38:14.962
And when they exit.

38:21.051 --> 38:22.427
I'll need to contact the super

38:22.511 --> 38:25.514
to get a list of all residents
in the past six months.

38:25.889 --> 38:27.641
Or just check the directory.

38:40.654 --> 38:42.614
Neal, who's listed in apartment three?

38:44.992 --> 38:46.577
No one. It's blank.

38:47.995 --> 38:50.205
That might explain the question mark.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.836
Siegel was here, and so was Hagen.

38:55.919 --> 38:58.213
They were looking into the same person.

38:58.839 --> 39:01.008
Let's see who lives in number three.

39:05.846 --> 39:07.431
I don't think anyone's home.

39:08.056 --> 39:09.474
Wait.

39:21.862 --> 39:23.822
Electronic trip wire.

39:24.114 --> 39:25.407
Careful.

39:46.845 --> 39:47.971
NEAL: What is all this?

40:03.904 --> 40:06.573
Neal, this is professional
reconnaissance work.

40:16.834 --> 40:19.419
This is all my movements
over the past year,

40:19.503 --> 40:20.921
perfectly cataloged.

40:21.547 --> 40:22.881
A map of your radius.

40:26.468 --> 40:29.012
Someone has been studying you.

40:33.725 --> 40:35.018
Not just me.

40:47.114 --> 40:49.199
PETER: This is everyone
who's in my division.

40:50.742 --> 40:52.244
The entire team.

41:08.927 --> 41:10.137
Neal?

41:15.684 --> 41:17.895
Whoever murdered Siegel
also framed Hagen.

41:18.562 --> 41:20.230
Probably killed him as well.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.941
This was practice.

42:23.627 --> 42:25.796
This is Rebecca's apartment.

42:26.964 --> 42:28.549
Who is she, Neal?

42:30.175 --> 42:31.343
Neal?

42:32.761 --> 42:33.762
Neal?
