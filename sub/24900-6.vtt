be nervous about a first date?

01:31.781 --> 01:33.576

the one who should be nervous,

01:39.720 --> 01:40.928
not you.

01:40.962 --> 01:43.137
But I don't have
the right dress

01:43.172 --> 01:44.414

would make you feel better,

know, I was smashing buildings.

just got a flat tire.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.747
