- Do you think
this shit is funny, Fatima?

21:23.366 --> 21:25.967

- No, it's not okay!

21:25.969 --> 21:27.969
A man is dead,

21:27.971 --> 21:29.637
That means you are, what?
Suspects!

21:29.639 --> 21:31.739

21:31.741 --> 21:34.041

21:47.023 --> 21:48.923
and I can fix this.

- Andi,
we don't need it.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.494
- Yes, you do.

21:53.496 --> 21:54.996
- We didn't do anything.

21:54.998 --> 21:56.864
- There you go.

21:56.866 --> 21:59.734

You look guilty as hell.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.335

- Fatima, when they find the
camera footage from the garage--

22:07.677 --> 22:09.010
- Andi.
- Your ass is grass.

22:09.012 --> 22:10.511
- There's no cameras by his car,

22:10.513 --> 22:12.680

we done been over this?

Do we know that

22:19.856 --> 22:22.089

- She doesn't know that.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.791
You wanna know why?

22:23.793 --> 22:26.160
Because after all the stuff
we went through in the garage,

22:26.162 --> 22:29.397
I put in a request
to have cameras installed.

22:29.399 --> 22:31.232
- And you didn't think
to tell me that?

22:31.234 --> 22:32.600
- I'm sorry.
- Damn.

22:32.602 --> 22:35.036
- All right, fine, fine.
- Now you are a criminal.

22:35.038 --> 22:38.873

nothing to do with it.

22:40.543 --> 22:42.743
I just went up there
to talk to him, right?

22:42.745 --> 22:46.380
He started with me first.
He swung, I dipped, bop, bop.

22:46.382 --> 22:49.483
It was self-defense, though. I
can't help that he can't fight.

22:49.485 --> 22:50.951
- Zac.
- He's a terrible liar.

22:50.953 --> 22:53.087
- What? That's what happened!

22:53.089 --> 22:54.955
- Zac, stop.
- What you mean, stop?

22:54.957 --> 22:57.625
I'm telling her what happened.
Remember?

22:57.627 --> 22:59.727
- No, he's not dead!

22:59.729 --> 23:02.797
- What?
- What?

23:02.799 --> 23:07.468
- Yes, I called the hospital
earlier, and he's still alive.

23:07.470 --> 23:10.071
-- like a damn cockroach.
Can't never get his ass.

23:10.073 --> 23:12.106
- What?

23:12.108 --> 23:14.742
- Yes, look, he wouldn't
leave me alone, okay?

23:14.744 --> 23:16.410
- Now that's true.

23:16.412 --> 23:19.246
- Yeah, so, I got in his car,
I put my brass knuckles on,

23:19.248 --> 23:21.082
and I popped his ass
in the mouth,

23:21.084 --> 23:23.217
and then I was like,
a little quick two-piece.

23:23.219 --> 23:25.653
Mm-hmm.
- No, don't play like that! No.

23:25.655 --> 23:29.890
- No, look, for real,
but then he hit me.

23:29.892 --> 23:31.559
- What?
- What?

23:31.561 --> 23:33.561
- Yeah.

- It is a little swollen.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.534
- Yeah, you can't really see it
because I put makeup over it.

23:40.536 --> 23:44.171
- So, wait, so...
This -- hit you in the face?

23:44.173 --> 23:45.840
- Yes, but--
- Ain't no buts.

23:45.842 --> 23:48.242
If he not dead, he gonna be dead
when I get to the hospital.

23:48.244 --> 23:49.944
- No, you can't say that.
- Zac.

23:49.946 --> 23:51.412
- Don't.

23:51.414 --> 23:53.747
- I wanted him to.
- Fine.

23:53.749 --> 23:55.449
- What?
- What?

23:55.451 --> 23:57.618
- Yeah.

23:57.620 --> 23:59.353
'Cause by tomorrow,

23:59.355 --> 24:01.956
I knew this bruise
would be really bad.

24:01.958 --> 24:04.258
Yep.
- Who are you, my god?

24:04.260 --> 24:07.528

oh, it gets better.

24:07.530 --> 24:10.464
I had my boys park in a van
next to his car,

24:10.466 --> 24:15.002
and they beat his ass
just enough to put him to sleep.

24:15.004 --> 24:16.837

I knew I loved you!

24:16.839 --> 24:20.007
- Oh, baby, it gets better!

24:20.009 --> 24:22.143
- ZAC: There's more to that?
- Yes!

24:22.145 --> 24:25.246
Then they put him
on the hood of his car naked!

24:28.784 --> 24:31.218
I can't make this shit up!
- But he ain't dead,

24:31.220 --> 24:33.487
though, right?
- No.

24:33.489 --> 24:35.356
