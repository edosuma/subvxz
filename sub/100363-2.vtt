00:06.945 --> 00:08.484
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

00:08.485 --> 00:10.907
On Earth, barely any time has passed,

00:10.908 --> 00:13.899
while here, it's been 300 years.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.160
High King Fen and Josh the Fresh Prince

00:16.170 --> 00:17.859
were overthrown 300 years ago.

00:17.860 --> 00:19.957
The Dark King reigns. Glory to his rule.

00:19.958 --> 00:22.626
So, tell me, did you happen
to bring any food with you?

00:22.627 --> 00:25.079
A monster rode you around for months

00:25.080 --> 00:26.670
while he murdered people,

00:26.673 --> 00:28.632
and then one of your
closest friends died.

00:28.633 --> 00:29.919
The surges are getting worse.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.261
I'm just saying,
this is the type of thing

00:31.262 --> 00:33.119
I should be using my magic to fix.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.847
The apocalypse is happening,

00:34.848 --> 00:37.179
but you won't accept my help

00:37.180 --> 00:39.379
- because I'm a woman?
- Quite right.

00:39.380 --> 00:41.769
My name is Professor Adiyodi.

00:41.770 --> 00:44.379
It's not a voice.
It's more like a signal.

00:44.380 --> 00:47.049
I'm gonna take down my
wards so you can show me.

00:47.050 --> 00:48.059
Professor?

00:48.060 --> 00:50.559
This building, it's missing.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.365
Do you know what kind
of skills it would take

00:52.366 --> 00:55.299
to steal a building
with level five wards?

00:55.300 --> 00:57.036
I miss him every day too.

00:57.040 --> 00:59.872
No one gets to tell you
how to grieve, Alice.

00:59.873 --> 01:02.199
If you need to do something crazy

01:02.200 --> 01:04.299
to get through it...

01:04.300 --> 01:06.450
do something crazy, okay?

02:31.185 --> 02:32.840
Quentin?

02:50.400 --> 02:51.550
Where am I?

02:55.140 --> 02:56.730
Where are my pants?

03:01.370 --> 03:02.579
If this is a dream...

03:02.580 --> 03:04.121
which it seems like it's a dream...

03:04.122 --> 03:06.372
shouldn't knowing it's
a dream wake me up?

03:06.373 --> 03:07.979
Unless it's a lucid dream

03:07.980 --> 03:09.751
like that episode of "Voyager."

03:09.752 --> 03:11.319
Or I've been kidnapped by aliens

03:11.320 --> 03:12.499
who are trying to get secrets out of me,

03:12.500 --> 03:14.841
like that other episode of "Voyager."

03:17.260 --> 03:18.759
- Something wrong?
- No.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.389
It's just, you sound like
someone I used to know.

03:21.390 --> 03:23.359
I feel like...

03:23.360 --> 03:26.436
I'm supposed to be helping
you with something.

03:26.437 --> 03:28.460
Is that weird?

03:28.470 --> 03:31.020
No, it isn't weird at all.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.619
You're right. This is a crazy dream.

03:37.620 --> 03:39.239
See, this belonged to my friend,

03:39.240 --> 03:40.324
and I can't read it.

03:40.325 --> 03:43.399
But you can, and you're
supposed to tell me

03:43.400 --> 03:46.205
what it says and then you'll wake up.

03:54.790 --> 03:57.504
- What language is it in?
- I was hoping you knew.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.801
I've never seen it before.

03:59.660 --> 04:00.699
What?

04:00.700 --> 04:02.969
Sorry.

04:02.970 --> 04:06.339
If it was Elvish or Klingon...

04:06.340 --> 04:08.299
This is a really weird dream.

04:08.300 --> 04:10.439
Do you have a car?

04:10.440 --> 04:11.981
Can you take me to Taco Bell?

04:24.786 --> 04:27.497
Where the hell is that portal tree?

04:29.040 --> 04:32.279
You are doing such a great job.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.003
Will you promise me something?

04:34.004 --> 04:35.919
When this is all over...

04:35.920 --> 04:38.219
we can still be friends?

04:38.220 --> 04:39.257
Meh.

04:39.258 --> 04:40.759
No!

04:43.262 --> 04:44.720
Whoa.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.299
This isn't real.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.379
Eliot!

04:51.380 --> 04:53.769
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:53.770 --> 04:55.579
How are you talking right now?

04:55.580 --> 04:57.526
I'm dead, not rude.

04:57.527 --> 04:59.274
- Oh, you're a ghost.
- Am I?

04:59.275 --> 05:01.259
- Sorry.
- It's hard to be mad.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.319
I was a terrible High King.

05:03.320 --> 05:06.319
Or that's what a lot of
people screamed at me,

05:06.320 --> 05:08.279
and a lot of strangers screaming at you

05:08.280 --> 05:09.779
- can't be wrong.
- Right.

05:09.780 --> 05:12.879
Anyhoo, they hung me.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.460
Fen out, bitches.

05:14.470 --> 05:16.119
For what it's worth,

05:16.120 --> 05:18.130
I am sorry that I wasn't
here to save you.

05:19.220 --> 05:21.899
It's okay, really.

05:21.900 --> 05:22.959
The last I heard,

05:22.960 --> 05:24.719
you were still possessed by The Monster.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.499
And I figured if they did save you,

05:27.500 --> 05:29.889
you'd probably be off drinking.

05:29.890 --> 05:32.519
Honestly, I was counting
on Margo to save me.

05:32.520 --> 05:35.819
Or Quentin or Alice or Penny

05:35.820 --> 05:37.519
or Julia or Dean Fogg,

05:37.520 --> 05:40.611
but I know the man I married.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.260
Too well, it seems.

05:43.270 --> 05:45.574
Oh, no, look at your sad face.

05:45.575 --> 05:47.909
Don't be hard on yourself.
I'm already dead.

05:47.910 --> 05:50.245
It's not like you can
do some kind of magic

05:50.246 --> 05:52.960
to turn back time...
wait, unless... can you?

05:52.961 --> 05:55.749
Eliot, if you can save
me, you have to do it.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.160
- The buzzards are coming soon...
- Wha...

05:57.170 --> 05:59.999
To peck out my eyes! My poor dead eyes!

06:00.000 --> 06:03.019
- Okay, fine. Jesus, ch... chill.
- Oh, God!

06:03.020 --> 06:06.049
Oh, God!

06:06.050 --> 06:07.089
Eliot!

06:23.960 --> 06:28.992
Which one of you beefy twats
built a magician-proof dungeon?

06:28.993 --> 06:31.954
All right, let's
brute-force this mother.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.720
Oh, my God.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.499
"My friends, if you're reading this,

06:50.500 --> 06:52.539
"it's because I'm dead

06:52.540 --> 06:55.539
"or I escaped and forgot
to get rid of this letter,

06:55.540 --> 06:56.812
"but probably the first one.

06:56.813 --> 06:58.799
"R-I-P me.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.299
"We knew something had
gone right on your end

07:00.300 --> 07:02.760
"when magic came back
stronger than ever,

07:02.770 --> 07:04.699
but then we didn't hear from you."

07:04.700 --> 07:07.113
- News from the Northern Marsh.
- What about our friends?

07:07.114 --> 07:08.616
Have any of the messenger
bunnies returned?

07:08.617 --> 07:09.779
Not as of yet.

07:09.780 --> 07:11.299
The rabbits believe the connection

07:11.300 --> 07:14.119
between our world and yours
has been disturbed somehow.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.560
They're refusing to come
out of their burrows

07:15.570 --> 07:17.454
no matter how many
cigarettes we offer them.

07:17.455 --> 07:20.739
"Days turned into months
with no word from anyone

07:20.740 --> 07:22.899
and no way for us to return to Earth."

07:22.900 --> 07:24.359
Her languorousness Abigail

07:24.360 --> 07:26.716
advises we send our armies
to the Northern Marsh

07:26.717 --> 07:28.678
to investigate the reports
of these creatures.

07:28.679 --> 07:31.589
The locals call them The Takers.

07:31.590 --> 07:34.460
Look, man, I may be drowning
my sorrows in fried chicken,

07:34.470 --> 07:35.489
but I'm not an idiot.

07:35.490 --> 07:36.560
We're in over our heads.

07:36.570 --> 07:38.339
That's why we need to
get a message to Margo.

07:38.340 --> 07:41.459
"We spent so much time
trying to get you back

07:41.460 --> 07:43.693
"that we didn't see the real
problem right in front of us.

07:43.694 --> 07:46.139
The people rose up against us."

07:46.140 --> 07:48.019
On the count of three, we charge.

07:48.020 --> 07:49.620
- I don't have a weapon.
- You are the weapon!

07:49.630 --> 07:50.949
I'm just saying, you have two.

07:50.950 --> 07:52.493
One, two, three, charge!

07:54.416 --> 07:56.122
"It did not go well for us."

07:59.340 --> 08:01.739
"Like a dope, I had
done some renovations

08:01.740 --> 08:04.249
"and made the dungeon magician-proof.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.549
"Oops.

08:06.550 --> 08:10.619
"Margo, I hope it's
you who finds this...

08:10.620 --> 08:12.699
"And I hope you understand,

08:12.700 --> 08:14.860
I did it all for you."

08:16.976 --> 08:18.849
"Good-bye."

08:23.000 --> 08:25.579
Did your pig visitor tell
you about the nature

08:25.580 --> 08:27.579
of this apocalyptic whatever-the-hell

08:27.580 --> 08:29.379
that's coming to kill us all?

08:29.380 --> 08:31.859
No, but magicians are
blowing themselves up

08:31.860 --> 08:33.058
all over the place.

08:33.059 --> 08:35.399
So many that civilians have caught on.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.958
- I think...
- There's too much goddamn magic.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.164
Yes, I know.

08:39.169 --> 08:42.359
Some surges come and go
and hardly anyone notices.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.839
And sometimes it's a clusterfuck

08:44.840 --> 08:46.334
of catastrophe and death.

08:46.335 --> 08:47.679
I'm trying to find a pattern.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.579
Why some surges and not others.

08:49.580 --> 08:51.999
Well, if you'd had a proper
Brakebills education,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.119
you'd know the answer.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.719
Circumstances, dear.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.684
The phase of the moon,
the nearest body of water.

08:59.685 --> 09:01.643
You must factor them
all into your casting.

09:01.644 --> 09:04.359
Even us filthy hedges
know about Circumstances.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.559
Trick is, certain Circumstances

09:06.560 --> 09:07.959
make casting easier.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.899
Others make them much more difficult.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.529
Some of the surges must be lining up

09:11.530 --> 09:14.199
with particularly
favorable Circumstances.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.839
Is there any way to predict them

09:15.840 --> 09:17.519
so we can warn people in advance?

09:17.520 --> 09:21.179
I may know someone who can help you.

09:21.180 --> 09:22.499
Professor Ex.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.039
Wait, like the X-Men?

09:24.040 --> 09:25.919
No, she's my ex-lover.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.479
I like calling her that
because she hates it.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.919
She's a genius at metamath.

09:34.330 --> 09:37.013
- Do you feel that?
- Surge.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.268
Damn it.

09:41.270 --> 09:44.896
That was Professor Ex's
classroom blowing up.

09:44.897 --> 09:47.315
I picked a hell of a
week to quit drinking.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.679
I asked around.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.617
Nobody knows who stole
the Book Depository.

09:56.618 --> 09:58.701
Did you ask David Copperfield?

09:58.702 --> 10:00.199
Yeah.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.419
Oh.

10:01.420 --> 10:03.916
But a job this big,
somebody should have seen it.

10:03.917 --> 10:06.219
All right, look.

10:06.220 --> 10:07.669
My brain is fried, so...

10:07.670 --> 10:09.339
I either need to get some sleep

10:09.340 --> 10:12.499
or to fry it some more recreationally.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.719
Well, club soda is as crazy
as I get these days, so...

10:15.720 --> 10:18.513
- Casual sex, then?
- Good-night, Pete.

10:23.050 --> 10:24.186
Good-night, boss.

10:27.850 --> 10:30.989
Your friend is like if
cocaine was a person.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.639
Well, it's a hedge bar.

10:32.640 --> 10:34.569
That description fits
half the people here.

10:34.570 --> 10:35.614
Not you.

10:37.020 --> 10:38.199
What am I?

10:38.200 --> 10:41.979
A Mossad assassin
undercover as a lumberjack?

10:44.620 --> 10:49.460
And you play bass in a J-pop
hard metal cover band?

10:49.470 --> 10:52.369
Close. K-pop.

10:52.370 --> 10:53.382
Yu-jin.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.410
Kady.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.979
Oh, good morning.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.539
Is it?

11:11.540 --> 11:13.315
Yeah, I know what you mean.

11:13.316 --> 11:15.560
Haven't had a night
like that in a while.

11:15.570 --> 11:17.698
I'll just, um... pants.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.869
Uh, if you, uh... wanna
hang sometime or...

11:26.870 --> 11:29.125
You know, I'm just gonna stop talking.

11:29.126 --> 11:30.836
Yeah, I'll just, uh...

11:37.389 --> 11:39.339
Um...

11:39.340 --> 11:41.305
C-call me.

11:42.740 --> 11:44.579
Finally getting that GED?

11:44.580 --> 11:46.519
Have some respect. I'm a professor.

11:46.520 --> 11:51.680
Oh, "Chapter Seven:
Traveling Against Your Will."

11:51.690 --> 11:53.260
That sounds like a problem.

11:53.270 --> 11:54.984
One of my students was
hearing this signal,

11:54.985 --> 11:57.071
and when I listened
to it, I just traveled.

11:57.072 --> 11:58.979
No idea where, no idea why,

11:58.980 --> 12:02.033
and none of this can explain it.

12:02.034 --> 12:05.529
So just don't listen
to the signal again?

12:05.530 --> 12:08.439
- Wow, thank you.
- Shut up.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.919
Except now I hear it all the time.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.019
This here helps quiet
it down a bit, but...

12:14.020 --> 12:15.999
It's kind of terrifying

12:16.000 --> 12:18.049
to lose control of yourself like that.

12:18.050 --> 12:19.439
Yeah.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.599
Are you okay?

12:21.600 --> 12:24.359
You know, hangover remedies are...

12:24.360 --> 12:25.891
kind of a specialty of mine.

12:25.892 --> 12:28.139
I remember.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.649
No judgment or anything,
but I thought...

12:30.650 --> 12:33.230
I'm sober.

12:33.236 --> 12:34.349
Well, I was.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.299
Almost a year, and here I am,

12:36.300 --> 12:39.529
and my head feels like
it's gonna explode.

12:39.530 --> 12:44.519
And if I remembered deciding
to have that first drink...

12:44.520 --> 12:45.819
I would tell you why I did it.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.871
You're human. Dust yourself off.

12:47.872 --> 12:50.039
Maybe keep searching for leads

12:50.040 --> 12:53.439
on that vanishing Book
Depository or whatever.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.499
What?

12:54.500 --> 12:56.339
That library branch that got heisted.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.507
You spent all day
yesterday looking for it.

13:00.340 --> 13:03.095
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

13:03.096 --> 13:05.556
Are you sure you're just hungover?

13:11.240 --> 13:12.470
Did you get my tacos?

13:14.620 --> 13:16.310
I got one of everything they had.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.060
- Whose house is this?
- My mom's.

13:22.070 --> 13:23.865
Where is she?

13:23.866 --> 13:26.452
She's at a sex... she's camping.

13:27.660 --> 13:29.870
This is a really long dream.

13:29.872 --> 13:31.122
Mm-hmm.

13:34.260 --> 13:35.649
- Hey.
- Oh, God.

13:35.650 --> 13:37.999
- What?
- Oh, hi.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.979
Um, look, I need help
with a metamath problem.

13:39.980 --> 13:42.399
The professor who specializes
in it at Brakebills

13:42.400 --> 13:45.079
blew herself up, so I figured,
uh, next best thing, right?

13:45.080 --> 13:47.264
Yeah, you know, uh,
now's not a good time.

13:48.540 --> 13:50.684
My cousin's here from Canada and, well,

13:50.685 --> 13:52.469
he's Canadian. So anyway,

13:52.470 --> 13:54.770
- I gotta go.
- Alice.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.939
That's... that's Quentin.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.400
What the hell did you do?

14:20.940 --> 14:22.090
Hello.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.920
Shit.

14:27.340 --> 14:29.219
So what do you say?

14:29.220 --> 14:32.559
Wanna go back in time, save my friends,

14:32.560 --> 14:35.359
and unfuck history for old times' sake?

14:35.360 --> 14:38.299
If I change anything,
it could undo every sacrifice

14:38.300 --> 14:39.814
we've all made to stop The Beast.

14:39.815 --> 14:43.579
Why did you build a workshop
full of time travel gadgets

14:43.580 --> 14:44.944
if you aren't willing to use them?

14:44.945 --> 14:46.399
The lesson that I've learned

14:46.400 --> 14:48.160
from a life of trying to change the past

14:48.170 --> 14:51.911
is, well, you almost
always make things worse.

14:51.912 --> 14:55.790
Speaking of, where is my
little volunteer tomato?

14:55.791 --> 14:57.500
Volunteer, um...

14:57.501 --> 14:59.044
Quentin, my dear.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.923
He died saving me.

15:04.174 --> 15:06.218
Saving everybody.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.989
Stiff upper lip, eh?

15:10.990 --> 15:12.969
Positively British of you.

15:12.970 --> 15:14.600
Someone's gotta keep it together.

15:14.601 --> 15:16.353
Is that what you think you're doing?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.769
Back when Quentin first came to Fillory

15:20.770 --> 15:22.760
in the very first timeline,

15:22.770 --> 15:24.309
he was running from grief.

15:24.310 --> 15:27.959
His best friend had died tragically.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.323
Julia.

15:29.324 --> 15:30.993
You.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.619
A victim of your own vices.

15:34.620 --> 15:39.059
I was worried that I was
taking advantage of him,

15:39.060 --> 15:41.019
of his sorrow.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.419
So the first change I
made was to save you

15:43.420 --> 15:46.379
to see if he would still
answer Fillory's call.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.999
And he did.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.299
And then he died...

15:50.300 --> 15:53.259
39 times.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.852
I had hoped this time
would be different.

15:56.853 --> 15:58.919
It still could be.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.599
You saved him 39 times.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.689
Why not 40?

16:02.690 --> 16:04.019
Because he won.

16:04.020 --> 16:06.479
If you took away his sacrifice,

16:06.480 --> 16:08.363
you'd lose everything
that it bought you:

16:08.364 --> 16:11.620
your life and the lives
of everyone around you.

16:11.630 --> 16:15.119
Same with your friends,
Josh and... was it Flen?

16:15.120 --> 16:16.779
It was not.

16:16.780 --> 16:19.499
You have to let go of the past, Eliot.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.879
Let the dead stay dead.

16:30.710 --> 16:33.120
Time is a motherfucker, isn't it?

16:35.650 --> 16:37.930
Ah, tea is ready.

16:49.620 --> 16:51.990
Oh, shit.

17:07.619 --> 17:08.919
Why are you staring at me?

17:08.920 --> 17:11.699
Because...

17:11.700 --> 17:13.010
Holy shit.

17:13.011 --> 17:15.939
You look like somebody I know.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.140
My friend Julia...

17:18.550 --> 17:19.601
her grandma.

17:20.460 --> 17:22.199
Yeah, okay, great.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.499
Um, you know, I actually
have to talk to Alice,

17:24.500 --> 17:26.942
so maybe you could go play
with rocks or something.

17:32.020 --> 17:34.099
So you built a golem out of living clay

17:34.100 --> 17:35.919
and used the book of Quentin's life

17:35.920 --> 17:38.480
to fill it with his memories?

17:38.490 --> 17:39.919
It's not so crazy.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.699
And then you animated the whole thing

17:41.700 --> 17:43.079
with his essence?

17:43.080 --> 17:45.999
No, it's just a tiny grain of Q's soul

17:46.000 --> 17:47.879
that I pulled from the Underworld.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.179
You wouldn't help me with a séance,

17:51.180 --> 17:52.464
and then you go and do this?

17:52.465 --> 17:55.479
Well, I... I knew it was
risky, but it worked.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.439
But it didn't.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.182
That is not the Quentin
you knew. That's...

17:59.183 --> 18:02.519
how could you do something like this?

18:06.340 --> 18:09.960
I found this in Q's stuff at Brakebills.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.519
What is this?

18:14.520 --> 18:17.158
I don't know. It's in a language
I've never seen before.

18:17.159 --> 18:19.452
It could be a... a letter or a diary

18:19.453 --> 18:21.989
or a project he was working on.

18:21.990 --> 18:24.339
I thought maybe he left
it for me to find.

18:24.340 --> 18:27.168
So you built the version of Q
that could read this for you.

18:27.169 --> 18:28.586
Right, but...

18:28.587 --> 18:31.339
He's 12, so he can't.

18:31.340 --> 18:32.959
Get rid of it.

18:32.960 --> 18:34.959
Put back the piece of Q's
essence that you stole

18:34.960 --> 18:36.303
and let him be at rest.

18:36.304 --> 18:38.469
It's not that simple.

18:38.470 --> 18:41.599
The spell keeps the golem alive

18:41.600 --> 18:45.145
until he completes the task
I brought him here to do.

18:45.146 --> 18:47.519
So the spell can never be finished

18:47.520 --> 18:50.519
'cause he can't read Q's letter.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.569
This was so insanely selfish.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.199
I can't sleep.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.709
I can barely breathe.

18:59.710 --> 19:02.679
I... I needed to fix something,

19:02.680 --> 19:03.999
finish something for him.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.332
Yeah, well, you fucked up.

19:05.333 --> 19:08.750
Maybe if we can figure
out how, we can fix it

19:08.756 --> 19:10.962
and you can put back the
piece of Quentin's soul

19:10.963 --> 19:13.700
where it belongs.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.800
I'm glad you called.

19:19.805 --> 19:22.515
Last night was a bit of a blur.

19:22.516 --> 19:24.142
I was hoping for a second chance.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.890
Kind of a blur for me too...

19:27.896 --> 19:29.815
- Mm.
- Which is why I called.

19:29.816 --> 19:31.439
See, I'm sober.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.149
I don't remember drinking last night,

19:34.150 --> 19:36.379
but I've got gaps in my memory,
and not just last night...

19:36.380 --> 19:38.239
I can't remember things
that happened days ago.

19:38.240 --> 19:40.060
What are you saying?

19:40.070 --> 19:42.359
I want to know if you can explain.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.913
Wait, you want to know if I drugged you?

19:44.914 --> 19:46.779
I left you my number.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.659
I... I showed up for a second date,

19:48.660 --> 19:50.859
which is big for me, since I
am terrified of settling down.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.699
Oh, maybe I took a chance on you

19:52.700 --> 19:54.119
because you remind me of my cousin,

19:54.120 --> 19:56.439
who I've been obsessed
with since we were 13.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.879
Yes, my first cousin,
but our moms are twins.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.889
So genetically my half-sister,
which makes it worse.

20:01.890 --> 20:03.222
Why am I saying all this?

20:03.223 --> 20:05.225
Because I "truthied" your drink.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.060
You drugged me to see if I drugged you?

20:10.400 --> 20:12.019
You are insane.

20:12.020 --> 20:15.139
But I swear, whatever happened
to you, I didn't do it.

20:15.140 --> 20:17.152
I... I mean, I did some
stuff to you. O-on you.

20:17.153 --> 20:19.479
I mean, with you! Th-the sex stuff!

20:19.480 --> 20:20.819
Because you asked, for the record.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.367
God, fucking truth serums.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.739
Wait, wait. Kady, Kady.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.699
Um...

20:28.700 --> 20:30.899
I got to my building this morning,

20:30.900 --> 20:33.044
and I couldn't remember
which apartment was mine.

20:33.045 --> 20:37.279
I... I thought, "Hey, crazy night."

20:37.280 --> 20:41.140
But it seems like if
your memory was changed,

20:41.149 --> 20:43.180
so was mine.

20:43.184 --> 20:44.681
I need to know why.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.499
If the beheading didn't kill Josh,

20:56.500 --> 20:57.940
the room service would have.

20:57.950 --> 20:59.779
I'll take your complaint to the manager.

20:59.780 --> 21:02.760
Eliot?

21:02.763 --> 21:04.159
Just in time.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.327
The cell is Margo-proof,

21:05.330 --> 21:08.040
and when the Dark King gets
back from his summer palace,

21:08.042 --> 21:09.919
I'm gonna be executed.

21:09.920 --> 21:10.999
What's that?

21:11.000 --> 21:13.100
The contents of Jane Chatwin's garage,

21:13.110 --> 21:14.819
which we will use to
take back our kingdom.

21:14.820 --> 21:16.599
My kingdom.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.709
But sure.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.759
What is this?

21:19.760 --> 21:21.279
"Permanence,"

21:21.280 --> 21:23.129
for men and women.

21:23.130 --> 21:26.380
Ugh, God, could you ask first?

21:27.980 --> 21:30.720
Says this will protect us
from timey-wimey-whatever.

21:30.730 --> 21:31.889
So we can change the past

21:31.890 --> 21:33.399
and not erase ourselves in the future.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.019
Clutch.

21:35.020 --> 21:37.479
- What's that?
- A smoker.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.640
Beekeepers use them to
calm down their hives.

21:40.650 --> 21:43.660
So that's super applicable
to our current situation.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.399
Wait.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.621
Josh would never shut up

21:49.622 --> 21:51.419
about the Royal Bees of Whitespire.

21:51.420 --> 21:53.659
They make all the honey
for the castle's kitchens.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.659
And they're talking bees.

21:55.660 --> 21:58.879
Okay, all you have to do

21:58.880 --> 22:01.840
is get the bees to deliver a
message to Josh in the past

22:01.850 --> 22:03.217
and then smoke them out.

22:03.218 --> 22:05.469
Huh, time bees.

22:14.020 --> 22:17.060
Hello, there, bees.

22:18.650 --> 22:20.109
Time bees activated.

22:20.110 --> 22:23.000
I'm not sure it feels
like we changed the past.

22:23.001 --> 22:24.609
At least, not yet.

22:24.610 --> 22:25.780
What are you doing?

22:25.790 --> 22:27.659
There used to be a letter in here.

22:27.660 --> 22:29.744
Huh.

22:38.240 --> 22:39.790
It's Fen's.

22:42.210 --> 22:44.479
High King Fen here giving you an update

22:44.480 --> 22:46.509
on life in Castle Whitespire.

22:46.510 --> 22:48.919
Babadook hats and open-toed shoes

22:48.920 --> 22:50.719
are the style this season.

22:50.720 --> 22:51.879
Ooh, hey, Josh.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.189
- Hey, get in my Insta story.
- Uh, no.

22:54.190 --> 22:57.105
- There is no Insta on Fillory, Fen... 
- But...

22:57.106 --> 22:58.309
So this is...

22:58.310 --> 23:00.419
- I have three bars.
- We're on a different planet.

23:00.420 --> 23:03.999
That's not even po...
how do you have three bars?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.821
This is... what phone is this?

23:05.822 --> 23:07.699
- The time bees.
- Oh, God, do you hear that?

23:07.700 --> 23:09.560
Well played, sister.

23:09.570 --> 23:11.619
- Oh, they're saying something.
- Fen, I'm allergic to bees!

23:11.620 --> 23:13.270
Or maybe not.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.179
- Oh, God!
- Please help me!

23:15.180 --> 23:17.584
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- I'm being killed...

23:17.585 --> 23:19.819
by so many bees!

23:19.820 --> 23:22.380
Did Josh say he was allergic?

23:22.385 --> 23:24.329
Right.

23:24.330 --> 23:28.009
That's why Josh would never
shut up about the bees.

23:28.010 --> 23:29.790
Oops.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.950
I had a friend who used to do that.

23:53.580 --> 23:55.959
Once he got to the end
of his favorite book,

23:55.960 --> 23:57.666
he'd go back to the beginning again.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.839
Endings are the worst part.

23:59.840 --> 24:03.460
Characters grow up, they move on.

24:03.467 --> 24:04.672
Some of them die.

24:04.673 --> 24:07.059
- It feels like...
- Your best friend in the whole world's

24:07.060 --> 24:08.800
abandoned you.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.389
- I've had this conversation before.
- So have I.

24:13.390 --> 24:15.199
The therapist my mom sends me to

24:15.200 --> 24:17.939
says I have transition anxiety.

24:17.940 --> 24:20.479
As if it's too much to ask
that nothing ever change.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.599
Well, your real friends
won't abandon you.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.359
That will never change.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.619
My best friend will start
dating skeevy guys

24:28.620 --> 24:33.819
who smoke and spit, and
she'll forget I ever existed.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.249
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this one,

24:36.250 --> 24:38.930
but the "skeevy guys" thing?

24:38.937 --> 24:40.708
It's just a phase.

24:40.709 --> 24:43.500
She needs you just as
much as you need her.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.670
Um, excuse me.

24:53.280 --> 24:56.460
I tried to find a flaw in the casting,

24:56.470 --> 24:57.599
but I couldn't.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.769
That's him.

25:00.560 --> 25:01.979
It's Q.

25:01.980 --> 25:04.819
The one I knew at that age.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.149
But the spell...

25:06.150 --> 25:09.999
I've been doing a lot of
reading on Circumstances.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.864
Not all of them are astrological.

25:11.865 --> 25:14.242
- Some of them...
- Are inside you.

25:17.328 --> 25:18.953
I think you did that spell perfectly.

25:18.954 --> 25:21.339
Your brain might have asked
for the version of Q

25:21.340 --> 25:23.779
that could his letter, but...

25:23.780 --> 25:27.160
your internal Circumstances
asked for something different.

25:27.170 --> 25:30.550
Maybe you need to ask him
a different question.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.439
What's that?

25:42.440 --> 25:45.272
"A History of Fillory,"
from the Royal Library.

25:45.273 --> 25:47.230
What does it say?

25:51.640 --> 25:54.569
"After the Fresh Prince
was stung to death

25:54.570 --> 25:57.940
"by a swarm of honey-drunk assassins,

25:57.950 --> 25:59.259
High King Fen... "

25:59.260 --> 26:01.869
My God, she listened to the bees.

26:01.870 --> 26:05.539
"She sent an army of soldiers
to hunt down the Dark King,

26:05.540 --> 26:07.959
"a massive manhunt that was viewed

26:07.960 --> 26:10.699
"as tyrannical overreach
by the people of Fillory.

26:10.700 --> 26:13.939
She was overthrown and executed."

26:13.940 --> 26:16.979
The Takers invaded,
the Dark King still rose.

26:19.265 --> 26:22.509
So... that's it, then?

26:22.510 --> 26:27.809
I-in what conceivable
universe is that it?

26:27.810 --> 26:30.319
I'm just saying, we're doing all of this

26:30.320 --> 26:32.760
to save a man you ostensibly love

26:32.770 --> 26:36.439
who died of a bee sting because
you forgot he was allergic.

26:36.440 --> 26:37.679
What is your fucking point?

26:37.680 --> 26:41.439
I was gone, you were alone...
and you hate being alone...

26:41.440 --> 26:43.779
and so you grabbed the first
dick that crossed your desk,

26:43.780 --> 26:45.707
and you're having a
hard time letting go.

26:45.708 --> 26:49.249
You think I should let go
of our friends' lives?

26:49.250 --> 26:52.299
I think you have a textbook case

26:52.300 --> 26:54.249
of cock blindness.

26:54.250 --> 26:58.012
You are Margo the Destroyer,
not Margo the Pining Girlfriend.

27:00.980 --> 27:02.679
I'm gonna let your bullshit slide

27:02.680 --> 27:04.819
on account of you so
recently being possessed

27:04.820 --> 27:06.855
by a homicidal monster...

27:08.320 --> 27:10.899
But I'm not changing my plan.

27:10.900 --> 27:12.527
Okay. Okay.

27:14.450 --> 27:15.650
Go for it.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.160
Wait.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.130
I recognize these.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.060
The first time Jane came
to Fillory by herself,

27:38.070 --> 27:40.479
she was homesick and
missed her brothers.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.973
A forest crone gave her these stamps.

27:41.974 --> 27:45.299
Put them on a letter,
address it whoever,

27:45.300 --> 27:47.779
wherever, whenever, and it gets to them.

27:47.780 --> 27:49.062
This could be our chance.

27:49.063 --> 27:51.649
I can just tell Josh how to fix things.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.159
Find an envelope!

27:55.160 --> 27:58.299
Address it to "Josh Hoberman,
Castle Whitespire,

27:58.300 --> 28:00.070
before he was killed by bees."

28:03.800 --> 28:06.139
"Dear Josh, hello from your friends

28:06.140 --> 28:07.539
"300 years in the future.

28:07.540 --> 28:09.559
"The bad news is, we can't
come back to get you.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.619
"The good news: if you
do exactly what I say,

28:11.620 --> 28:13.179
you won't be overthrown and executed."

28:13.180 --> 28:15.539
Uh, Fen, you're gonna want to see this!

28:15.540 --> 28:17.019
"Those reports you've been ignoring

28:17.020 --> 28:18.379
"about an invasion of creatures

28:18.380 --> 28:19.761
"in the Northern Marsh?

28:19.762 --> 28:22.929
Stop ignoring them.
Send an army, today."

28:22.930 --> 28:25.379
- I told you we should have.
- Just shush!

28:25.380 --> 28:27.099
Summon the guards!

28:27.100 --> 28:29.679
Everyone, we did it!

28:29.680 --> 28:31.279
We scared The Takers back

28:31.280 --> 28:32.773
to wherever the hell they came from.

28:32.774 --> 28:33.950
Go us!

28:33.955 --> 28:36.439
"And somehow, when we fix the past... "

28:37.650 --> 28:40.740
"I hope we can see each other again.

28:40.744 --> 28:42.080
Love, Margo."

28:48.260 --> 28:50.679
The letter disappeared the
moment I closed the mailbox.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.180
It worked.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.479
Josh and Fen did a banishment spell

28:55.480 --> 28:58.359
to scare off The Takers... they thought.

28:58.360 --> 28:59.801
Then the creatures came back

28:59.802 --> 29:01.119
and killed Josh and Fen

29:01.120 --> 29:02.470
and everyone in Whitespire.

29:05.519 --> 29:06.889
Don't say anything.

29:16.980 --> 29:18.879
Okay, it's working.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.339
So how does a homemade
psychic amplifier help

29:22.340 --> 29:23.657
if I'm not a psychic?

29:23.658 --> 29:25.529
Lowers the bar just
enough for the two of you

29:25.530 --> 29:26.899
to be able to connect your minds.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.409
We're both missing memories.

29:28.410 --> 29:29.469
If we combine the ones we have,

29:29.470 --> 29:30.789
it might be enough to give us an answer.

29:30.790 --> 29:33.750
Huh, so it's like, uh, memory VR.

29:33.751 --> 29:36.249
- No.
- So you're sure about this?

29:36.250 --> 29:39.759
I'm sure I need to know
what happened to me.

29:39.760 --> 29:40.879
You?

29:40.880 --> 29:43.470
- Same.
- Don't touch.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.680
Hands together, please.

29:54.340 --> 29:56.350
So where should we start?

29:56.357 --> 29:58.943
Last night, the bar.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.519
Your friend is like if
cocaine was a person.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.299
Well, it's a hedge bar.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.599
That description fits
half the people here.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.340
Not you.

30:17.350 --> 30:21.179
Oh, come on, this is totally memory VR.

30:21.180 --> 30:23.219
Shh.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.540
All right, now what?

30:24.550 --> 30:26.959
A Mossad assassin undercover as...

30:26.960 --> 30:31.239
Now we watch.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.599
And you...

30:33.600 --> 30:37.065
play bass in a J-pop
hard metal cover band?

30:42.860 --> 30:44.230
I could look away.

30:44.238 --> 30:46.820
You clearly already remember it.

30:52.780 --> 30:53.989
I don't know.

30:53.990 --> 30:56.180
No drugs slipped into our drinks,

30:56.190 --> 30:58.829
no head injuries.

30:58.830 --> 31:01.880
Whatever happened to us,
it seems like we both forgot.

31:23.940 --> 31:25.059
Whoa, what the hell?

31:29.296 --> 31:30.700
Stop! What are you doing?

31:39.980 --> 31:43.439
Kady, I... I know that looked bad.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.289
What the hell was that?

31:45.290 --> 31:46.669
What, some kind of memory spell?

31:46.670 --> 31:48.329
I mean, it looked like it,
but I don't know.

31:48.330 --> 31:49.340
I don't remember.

31:49.345 --> 31:51.553
Well, what the hell do
you remember, then?

31:51.554 --> 31:54.039
- Why were you at the bar?
- To drink.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.139
T-to...

31:56.140 --> 31:57.894
to meet a friend.

31:57.895 --> 31:59.604
- Who?
- A... a hedge

31:59.605 --> 32:01.356
I know from my first safe house.

32:01.357 --> 32:02.525
Show me.

32:07.020 --> 32:09.199
That's my friend. She's...

32:09.200 --> 32:10.741
The woman that Pete left with.

32:17.669 --> 32:18.790
What are you?

32:18.791 --> 32:20.709
What, some kind of Manchurian Candidate?

32:20.710 --> 32:22.460
A sleeper agent that gets activated

32:22.470 --> 32:24.439
to attack women in their bedrooms?

32:24.440 --> 32:26.548
This doesn't make any sense.

32:26.549 --> 32:28.008
What's on the card?

32:33.514 --> 32:36.308
I-I can't make it out.

32:36.309 --> 32:37.710
Damn it.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.270
I know what's on the card.

32:40.271 --> 32:42.059
How?

32:42.060 --> 32:43.469
You put your phone number on it...

32:43.470 --> 32:44.760
Whoa, K-Kady, wait...

32:44.770 --> 32:47.530
So show me who you really are.

33:09.490 --> 33:12.719
Someone sent you to
erase my memory. Who?

33:12.720 --> 33:14.119
I have no idea.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.799
I never do.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.599
I get a job, I do it,

33:17.600 --> 33:19.460
and when it's over,

33:19.470 --> 33:21.062
I make sure I don't remember.

33:21.070 --> 33:23.139
You walk around having no idea

33:23.140 --> 33:24.394
what you do for a living?

33:24.395 --> 33:26.540
Why would I want that on my conscience?

33:26.550 --> 33:29.279
Because that's what a conscience is for,

33:29.280 --> 33:31.540
to keep you from doing fucked up shit.

33:31.550 --> 33:35.299
The world is painful.
That's not gonna change.

33:35.300 --> 33:38.179
So I use whatever crutch I have to

33:38.180 --> 33:39.239
to keep going.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.460
The point is,

33:41.470 --> 33:43.199
you can take the shiv from my throat,

33:43.200 --> 33:46.379
because I can't rat out
someone I don't remember.

33:46.380 --> 33:48.679
Well, my friend's a psychic.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.279
Why don't I have him root around

33:50.280 --> 33:52.385
and see what you do and don't remember?

33:54.040 --> 33:56.305
Then you don't leave
me much choice, Kady.

33:56.306 --> 33:58.389
Mortem.

33:58.390 --> 34:01.219
No, no! Damn it!

34:01.220 --> 34:03.500
Who sent... who sent you?

34:03.501 --> 34:05.059
Who...

34:14.880 --> 34:16.242
What the hell happened?

34:16.243 --> 34:19.870
I don't know. He just...
self-destructed.

34:22.440 --> 34:24.000
He's gone.

34:28.004 --> 34:30.422
Telling them to kill the
Dark King was a bust.

34:30.422 --> 34:32.719
Same with going after The Takers.

34:34.010 --> 34:36.639
We need a new plan.
We only have two stamps left.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.259
One stamp. After your
last letter to Josh,

34:39.260 --> 34:40.449
I had an idea.

34:40.449 --> 34:43.998
I gave it a shot. It didn't work, so...

34:44.000 --> 34:45.309
one stamp.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.313
And you didn't tell me?

34:47.315 --> 34:48.989
I'm not your subject.

34:48.996 --> 34:51.018
- I'm your friend.
- Fine.

34:51.020 --> 34:52.945
Then what would you tell Josh to do?

34:52.946 --> 34:56.739
Run to the nearest dive and
drink himself to death?

34:58.160 --> 35:00.079
Yes.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.489
I would run away,

35:01.490 --> 35:04.139
because you try to save your friends

35:04.140 --> 35:06.079
and they die anyway.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.760
You can't stop The Takers,

35:07.770 --> 35:09.252
and you can't stop the Dark King.

35:09.253 --> 35:11.320
And if we don't focus
on getting you out,

35:11.330 --> 35:13.799
you're gonna get decapitated.

35:13.800 --> 35:15.840
Fillory is fucked because it always is,

35:15.850 --> 35:17.899
and I don't get why you keep
trying to fix something

35:17.900 --> 35:19.049
that wants to be broken.

35:19.050 --> 35:22.840
It may be broken, but it's my home.

35:22.850 --> 35:25.019
It hasn't been your home for 300 years.

35:27.180 --> 35:28.769
You are right about one thing.

35:28.770 --> 35:30.941
I have gone soft.

35:30.950 --> 35:32.839
I've been telling myself

35:32.840 --> 35:34.859
that if I can just keep Josh from dying,

35:34.860 --> 35:37.359
somehow I can get him
and my kingdom back.

35:37.360 --> 35:39.617
But that's not possible, is it?

35:45.961 --> 35:47.249
What are you telling him?

35:51.880 --> 35:53.979
I told him he needs to stay here.

35:53.980 --> 35:56.080
He can use the information
from this history book

35:56.090 --> 35:57.659
to fight the Dark King and The Takers

35:57.660 --> 36:00.721
wherever they show up
for the rest of his life.

36:03.740 --> 36:05.680
I told him good-bye.

36:21.900 --> 36:25.200
I'm not dreaming, am I?

36:27.120 --> 36:29.339
I ask because it's been,
like, a full day,

36:29.340 --> 36:32.540
and if you sleep for that long,
it's 'cause you're dead.

36:37.420 --> 36:40.039
I had this friend...

36:40.040 --> 36:43.050
who I loved very much...

36:44.430 --> 36:48.810
And he died, and I didn't
get to say good-bye.

36:49.700 --> 36:52.299
And I honestly don't know

36:52.300 --> 36:54.219
how I'm gonna go on without him.

36:54.220 --> 36:58.070
And he gave me this
gift I can never repay.

37:02.070 --> 37:03.479
What was the gift?

37:03.480 --> 37:05.910
His life.

37:07.760 --> 37:09.990
He gave it up for mine.

37:12.626 --> 37:16.250
I brought you here
'cause I wanted closure.

37:16.259 --> 37:19.169
You know, I just... I wanted to...

37:19.170 --> 37:22.859
fix something or finish
something for him.

37:22.860 --> 37:25.760
But the letter I showed you,

37:25.770 --> 37:27.639
you couldn't read it, so...

37:27.640 --> 37:31.499
You're skipping to the
beginning of the book.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.269
What?

37:33.270 --> 37:35.619
I can't help you

37:35.620 --> 37:37.599
because you don't want me to.

37:37.600 --> 37:41.110
Because then your
friend's story is over.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.640
My dad says when I get
sad about something

37:49.650 --> 37:52.320
that's gonna end...

37:52.330 --> 37:55.460
I should just imagine
this is the first page

37:55.461 --> 37:56.749
in a new book.

38:01.175 --> 38:03.219
The gift your friend gave you...

38:05.170 --> 38:06.969
It wasn't his life.

38:06.970 --> 38:09.979
It was yours.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.950
That story just started.

38:13.470 --> 38:15.389
What?

38:15.390 --> 38:18.939
I just shouldn't be surprised
that, even at age 12,

38:18.940 --> 38:22.610
Quentin Coldwater is still
the smartest person I know.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.790
I'm feeling tired.

38:34.060 --> 38:36.120
Really tired.

38:38.790 --> 38:42.460
Hey, do you want to see a trick?

38:42.470 --> 38:44.010
Sure.

39:02.980 --> 39:04.990
- That was cool.
- Yeah.

39:15.580 --> 39:18.920
There's just one more
thing I wanted to say.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.070
I...

39:24.120 --> 39:26.299
Good-bye, Quentin.

39:36.030 --> 39:37.563
He's gone.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.560
You okay?

39:43.570 --> 39:45.119
I'm sorry he couldn't give you

39:45.120 --> 39:46.822
the answer you wanted.

39:49.540 --> 39:52.570
No, he did.

39:57.880 --> 40:01.120
Maybe I can still help
you with your problem.

40:08.020 --> 40:10.499
My dad had a friend with a...

40:10.500 --> 40:13.119
really rare discipline,

40:13.120 --> 40:15.540
predicting Circumstances.

40:15.550 --> 40:16.859
They lost touch years ago,

40:16.860 --> 40:20.259
but she wrote this.

40:20.260 --> 40:22.439
_

40:22.440 --> 40:26.080
If anyone can find the
pattern you're looking for,

40:26.090 --> 40:27.738
it'll be her.

40:29.336 --> 40:30.574
Thanks.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.069
I don't remember any of it.

40:33.070 --> 40:35.979
The Book Depository,

40:35.980 --> 40:38.957
the mystery woman who
apparently wiped my memory.

40:38.958 --> 40:40.626
All I know is what you told me, which...

40:40.627 --> 40:43.519
Isn't enough to do anything with.

40:43.520 --> 40:44.859
Somebody's out there with enough power

40:44.860 --> 40:47.439
to steal a building,
paranoid enough to send

40:47.440 --> 40:50.511
mind-wiping sleeper agent
assassins after you...

40:50.512 --> 40:51.719
It's not nothing.

40:51.720 --> 40:55.719
Well, I need a drink.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.499
Sorry. Insensitive.

40:58.500 --> 41:00.980
I'll show myself out.

41:06.318 --> 41:08.529
How are you feeling?

41:10.420 --> 41:13.840
You know, I thought that
if I took on more power

41:13.850 --> 41:16.799
and more responsibility...

41:16.800 --> 41:18.949
that I'd want heroin less.

41:18.950 --> 41:21.679
But the truth is,

41:21.680 --> 41:23.459
when I thought I'd relapsed,

41:23.460 --> 41:26.219
I wasn't disappointed.

41:26.220 --> 41:27.959
Wasn't mad at myself.

41:27.960 --> 41:30.970
I was relieved.

41:32.860 --> 41:35.380
It gave me permission
to relapse some more.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.699
And trying to lead the hedges,

41:38.700 --> 41:40.930
it's only gonna get harder.

41:42.160 --> 41:45.689
And I'm not sure I can
do it without a crutch.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.899
Which maybe means
I shouldn't do it at all.

41:57.420 --> 41:59.790
No, don't.

42:10.580 --> 42:12.420
You never quite get used to the smell

42:12.426 --> 42:14.802
of Fillorian plumbing, do you?

42:14.803 --> 42:16.470
Josh...

42:17.880 --> 42:19.339
You're alive.

42:19.340 --> 42:21.894
Thanks to you. I got your letter.

42:23.230 --> 42:25.849
Right. The letter.

42:25.850 --> 42:26.999
Did exactly what you said.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.239
I went to the Clock Dwarf,
brought him a ham sandwich,

42:29.240 --> 42:32.154
and told him to send
me forward 300 years.

42:33.240 --> 42:35.859
- Just you?
- No, Fen came too.

42:35.860 --> 42:37.620
And Tick, and Rafe,

42:37.630 --> 42:39.379
and a few guys from my bowling league...

42:39.380 --> 42:43.139
I started a bowling league...
and a dozen other people.

42:43.140 --> 42:44.859
Nobody cool wanted to stay in the past

42:44.860 --> 42:46.620
once they knew what was coming.

42:47.891 --> 42:49.587
I can't believe it.

42:49.588 --> 42:51.632
Look behind the stone.

42:59.380 --> 43:01.725
I hid it there before I left.

43:07.620 --> 43:10.440
Margo, thank you.

43:14.620 --> 43:16.569
May I present the government

43:16.570 --> 43:20.560
of High King Margo in exile.

43:26.220 --> 43:28.500
Let's get out of here
before we all get killed.
