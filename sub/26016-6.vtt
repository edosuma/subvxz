00:20.846 --> 00:25.056
Oh, Hamnet, you do look lovely.
Every heart will melt.

00:25.096 --> 00:26.216
Oh, Nan!

00:26.256 --> 00:30.296
A proper little English gentleman
on the most important day of his life.

00:30.336 --> 00:32.216
Most important, Mum?
Really?

00:32.256 --> 00:33.896
It's his confirmation, Will.

00:33.936 --> 00:35.976
He's to be welcomed into the Church.

00:36.016 --> 00:38.816
And if you go spoiling it
with your bloomin' scepticism,

00:38.856 --> 00:40.256
I shall never forgive you.

00:40.296 --> 00:42.096
How can you suggest such a thing, Anne?

00:42.136 --> 00:45.936
I will treat the spectacle of our corrupt
and drunken old sot of a vicar

00:45.976 --> 00:47.936
taking a large wodge of my cash

00:47.976 --> 00:51.776
to induct Hamnet
into his mob of murderers, inquisitors,

00:51.816 --> 00:55.216
hypocrites and perverts
with due solemnity.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.896
Now, just you look here,
Will Shakespeare.

00:56.936 --> 00:59.136
I know there's plenty of wrong 'uns
in the clergy,

00:59.176 --> 01:01.296
but Hamnet ain't being
welcomed by them.

01:01.336 --> 01:02.496
Not in <i>my</i> mind.

01:02.536 --> 01:07.176
He's being welcomed by <i>God</i>
and the love that surpasseth all understanding.

01:07.316 --> 01:08.576
Well, you've got that right.

01:08.616 --> 01:11.696
A <i>love</i> that consists principally
of torturing and burning people

01:11.736 --> 01:13.816
who believe in <i>exactly</i>
the same God as you

01:13.856 --> 01:18.136
but use <i>slightly</i> more candles
and wear <i>slightly</i> sillier hats while doing it

01:18.176 --> 01:20.736
<i>is</i> pretty hard
to get your head round.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.656
Don't do this, Will,
I'm warning you!

01:22.696 --> 01:25.096
Hamnet's confirmation means a <i>lot</i> to me,

01:25.136 --> 01:27.536
and you <i>absolutely</i> promised
you'd be there.

01:27.576 --> 01:29.256
I know that, wife, and I will.

01:29.296 --> 01:32.216
Although I can't imagine
<i>God's</i> bothered either way.

01:32.256 --> 01:34.416
What would you know
about what bothers God?

01:34.456 --> 01:36.096
I don't think you even believe in him!

01:36.136 --> 01:38.936
For the avoidance of being burned alive,
Mum, I <i>do</i>.

01:40.536 --> 01:42.536
We have <i>so</i> much to be thankful for!

01:42.576 --> 01:45.696
One in three kids dies
before they're 11, you know.

01:45.736 --> 01:47.256
Ours have all made it.

01:47.296 --> 01:49.776
I'm aware of the child mortality rates,
Anne.

01:49.816 --> 01:54.296
Another aspect of God's love that
<i>definitely</i> surpasseth all understanding.

01:54.336 --> 01:57.936
Life's a mystery, Will,
and you may have a very big brain,

01:57.976 --> 02:00.096
but there are more things
in Heaven and Earth

02:00.136 --> 02:02.256
than are <i>dreamt</i> of in your philosophy.

02:02.296 --> 02:05.976
In faith, she may be an illiterate
milking-slap but she can coin a phrase!

02:08.295 --> 02:09.376
That was a corker!

02:10.616 --> 02:12.656
Discreetly will I jot it down.

02:12.696 --> 02:15.896
Anne's right.
It's time you counted your blessings.

02:15.936 --> 02:19.216
You're richer than your dad <i>ever</i> was,
and he's been thieving all his life.

02:19.256 --> 02:22.576
Not thieving, love, not any more.

02:22.616 --> 02:24.176
<i>Common</i> people are thieves,

02:24.216 --> 02:26.696
and <i>I</i> am a gentleman now.

02:26.736 --> 02:29.016
So it's just creative accounting.

02:30.416 --> 02:33.816
And the more you do of it,
the more likely you'll get a knighthood.

02:33.856 --> 02:37.776
Oh!
Husband, such a giddy prospect!

02:37.816 --> 02:41.176
Do you think you <i>could</i> steal enough
to earn a knighthood?

02:41.216 --> 02:44.856
As an English gentleman,
it is my <i>duty</i> to try.

02:47.096 --> 02:49.536
Dad, you've got a letter
off the London coach.

02:49.576 --> 02:52.216
Oh, thank you, Judith.
Wonder what this could be.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.256
Oh, my giddy, goody godlingtons!

02:54.296 --> 02:56.336
There's to be London theatre awards!

02:56.376 --> 02:57.456
What's that when it's at home?

02:57.496 --> 03:01.896
A glittering, star-studded evening
in which the cream of London's theatre

03:01.936 --> 03:04.816
will compete
for curiously shaped statuettes.

03:06.016 --> 03:09.616
There's to be awards for best play,
best comedy, best revival,

03:09.656 --> 03:12.096
and I am nominated in all categories!

03:12.136 --> 03:14.976
This is absolutely brilliant.
I shall win the lot.

03:15.016 --> 03:16.616
Well, how can you be so sure?

03:16.656 --> 03:18.496
Because I'm the greatest writer
that ever lived.

03:18.536 --> 03:22.936
But also because the last plague forced
most of London's companies on the road.

03:22.976 --> 03:25.896
There's scarcely been any shows in town
but mine all year.

03:25.936 --> 03:27.416
I'll sweep the board.

03:27.456 --> 03:31.136
The ceremony's on the second Tuesday
after Michael-Maundy Thursday.

03:31.176 --> 03:33.376
That's the date of Hamnet's confirmation.

03:33.416 --> 03:34.816
You'll have to change it.

03:34.856 --> 03:38.576
Change it?
Will, this isn't a bloomin' tea party.

03:38.616 --> 03:40.616
Actually, it <i>is</i> a tea party, Mum.

03:40.656 --> 03:43.016
You've invited all the aunties round
for cake.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.896
Snotty, stuck-up bitchingtons.

03:45.936 --> 03:48.496
My sisters are not
snotty, stuck-up bitchingtons.

03:48.536 --> 03:50.496
Gran, they <i>so</i> are!

03:50.536 --> 03:51.896
They are not!

03:51.936 --> 03:54.656
They are as down-to-earth
and as approachable as I am.

03:54.696 --> 03:55.896
Exactly!

03:57.176 --> 04:00.936
Hamnet has an appointment with God,
and <i>you</i> promised you'd be there.

04:00.976 --> 04:04.136
What could be more important
than his spiritual wellbeing?

04:04.176 --> 04:06.616
The London bloomin' Theatre Awards,
that's what!

04:06.656 --> 04:08.816
And, quite frankly, if God considers that

04:08.856 --> 04:11.136
Hamnet's soul
will be of greater spiritual value

04:11.176 --> 04:14.936
because you've dressed him up in a ruffle
and invited the aunties round for cake,

04:14.976 --> 04:18.656
then, for an omniscient deity,
I fear he lacks self-confidence.

04:20.216 --> 04:23.936
I'm <i>going</i> to my bloomin' awards night,
and so if you want me at Hamnet's confirmation

04:23.976 --> 04:26.896
you'll just have to go to the vicar
and change the date!

04:26.936 --> 04:31.016
You're a selfish man, Will Shakespeare!
A horrible, selfish man!

04:31.056 --> 04:35.376
But, wife, a horrible, selfish man
who's been nominated in <i>several</i> categories

04:35.416 --> 04:38.056
at the London Theatre Awards.

04:38.096 --> 04:39.536
Happy in my own skin.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.076
Well, this is <i>most</i> unexpected.

04:45.116 --> 04:47.056
A summons from
the Master of the Inns of Court

04:47.096 --> 04:49.376
to give a private
Sunday-night performance.

04:49.416 --> 04:50.776
Oh, what's the play?

04:50.816 --> 04:53.536
A revival of Robert Greene's
Friar Bacon And Friar Bungay.

04:53.576 --> 04:55.056
Oh, dear God, no.

04:55.096 --> 04:58.216
Oh, worst play ever.
Even <i>I</i> can't make it work, and I'm a genius.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.096
Yes, 'tis a very <i>mystery</i>
why anyone would wish to revive it.

05:01.136 --> 05:03.376
- I'm <i>not</i> interested.
- Nor me.

05:03.416 --> 05:04.896
The money's good
and a fine dinner promised.

05:04.936 --> 05:06.176
- I'll do it.
- Me too.

05:10.646 --> 05:12.416
So dispiriting!

05:12.456 --> 05:14.256
I've been standing
in the market <i>all</i> day,

05:14.296 --> 05:16.976
and not a <i>single</i> mark
be made upon my petition.

05:17.016 --> 05:18.896
- Petition, Kate?
- Yes.

05:18.936 --> 05:22.816
I plan to appeal to the municipal
authorities to ban bear-baiting.

05:22.856 --> 05:25.256
Why would you want to ban bear-baiting?
It's a laugh.

05:25.296 --> 05:28.296
Get a bear, you tie an enraged
and distressed ape to its back,

05:28.336 --> 05:32.776
tether it in an arena and then set
a pack of half-starved dogs on it.

05:33.346 --> 05:34.896
I mean, what's not to like?

05:34.936 --> 05:38.376
That it's sickeningly cruel
and <i>disgustingly</i> savage!

05:38.416 --> 05:39.736
As I say, what's not to like?

05:39.776 --> 05:41.816
Come on, Kate, it's funny.

05:41.856 --> 05:45.336
Watching the big old bear
swatting and clawing at the dogs

05:45.376 --> 05:47.056
as they tear lumps out of its flesh.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.896
Life's brutal and hard, Kate.
Man needs his sport.

05:49.936 --> 05:52.016
Yes, I do understand that,

05:52.056 --> 05:56.176
which is why I'm trying to promote
a <i>meat</i>-free alternative.

05:56.216 --> 05:57.816
Meat-free bear-baiting?

05:58.896 --> 06:00.256
<i>Pear</i>-baiting!

06:01.616 --> 06:05.736
Take a ripe pear,
impale a juicy raspberry upon its stalk

06:05.776 --> 06:09.496
and set a pack of
reasonably hungry gerbils on it.

06:09.536 --> 06:13.856
All will be merry as the furry creatures
nibble ferociously at the juicy fruit.

06:13.896 --> 06:15.736
How long till the pear be eaten?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.456
Who will get the biggest chunk?

06:17.496 --> 06:21.616
It ain't gonna happen, Kate.
Man is cruel. It's a fact of life.

06:21.656 --> 06:23.696
But slowly he improves.

06:23.736 --> 06:26.096
Why, in Roman times, 'twas not animals

06:26.136 --> 06:28.816
but humans who were savaged to death
for entertainment,

06:28.856 --> 06:30.536
so there has been progress.

06:30.576 --> 06:31.696
Which reminds me.

06:31.736 --> 06:34.336
They're disembowelling Catholics at Tyburn
this afternoon, Bottom.

06:34.376 --> 06:36.176
Thought I might mooch along.

06:36.216 --> 06:37.376
Love it!

06:37.416 --> 06:39.736
Amazing how long
them Catholics stay alive.

06:39.776 --> 06:42.376
I mean, even after they've been
disembowelled

06:42.416 --> 06:43.936
and had their privy parts struck

06:43.976 --> 06:46.536
from their bodies
and placed within their screaming mouths.

06:46.576 --> 06:49.656
I'm like,
"Come on, just <i>die</i>, it's getting boring!"

06:50.736 --> 06:52.376
We could take a picnic.

06:52.416 --> 06:55.656
Oh, except... <i>Damn</i>, I keep forgetting!
I'm in hiding.

06:55.696 --> 06:58.136
Zounds!
I really wish I'd thought this plan through.

06:58.176 --> 07:00.096
Being dead really limits your social life.

07:01.376 --> 07:04.976
Bottom! Bring ale, bring pie!
Your master is returned.

07:05.016 --> 07:07.216
"Please" might be nice.
Manners cost nothing.

07:07.256 --> 07:11.056
<i>You</i>, on the other hand, cost a penny a week,
so get my bloomin' ale and pie.

07:12.176 --> 07:13.896
Did you have a good journey,
Mr Shakespeare?

07:13.936 --> 07:16.336
No, Kate.
The natural order remains intact.

07:16.376 --> 07:18.576
Night follows day,
the Queen sits upon the throne,

07:18.616 --> 07:20.976
and I had a truly <i>crapsome</i> journey.

07:21.016 --> 07:22.416
Jam-packed and reeking!

07:22.456 --> 07:26.016
I thought you'd decided to pay
the ha'penny weekend upgrade

07:26.056 --> 07:27.696
to sit on the posh bench,

07:27.736 --> 07:30.896
so, despite the coach being packed,
you'd still have space and comfort.

07:30.936 --> 07:32.736
I did, Bottom, but mark this.

07:32.776 --> 07:35.696
When the coach <i>was</i> packed,
those who had <i>not</i> paid the ha'penny upgrade

07:35.736 --> 07:39.216
to sit on the posh bench
simply thrust themselves upon it anyway.

07:40.136 --> 07:44.456
But did not the coach guard inspect
<i>each</i> ticket with stern, unflinching gaze

07:44.496 --> 07:48.016
and order those with <i>standard</i> tickets
to <i>vacate</i> the posh bench <i>at once</i>

07:48.056 --> 07:49.776
or suffer a <i>heavy</i> fine?

07:49.816 --> 07:52.176
Yes, Kate, he <i>absolutely</i> did.

07:52.216 --> 07:54.496
Except, <i>hang on</i>...
<i>No</i>, he didn't.

07:54.536 --> 07:59.576
He <i>sat</i> atop his distant perch muttering
a series of semi-comprehensible remarks

07:59.616 --> 08:01.616
about not stopping at Watford,

08:01.656 --> 08:05.496
whilst beneath him
all order was forsaken and chaos ruled.

08:05.536 --> 08:09.376
Funny how when the coach be but
half-filled with blameless gentlefolk,

08:09.416 --> 08:10.776
the guard is ever-diligent,

08:10.816 --> 08:14.016
forcing sweet old ladies
to fossick deep in their satchels

08:14.056 --> 08:17.176
and nursing mothers
to lay aside their suckling infants

08:17.216 --> 08:19.256
that they may reach
the pockets of their gowns.

08:19.296 --> 08:22.496
But when the coach is ram-packed
with strutting hooligans

08:22.536 --> 08:26.576
and their gobbly,
over-entitled tarting-slaps,

08:26.616 --> 08:29.656
this same knight of the road
be nowhere to be seen.

08:29.696 --> 08:34.096
Thus did I end up paying an upgrade
to be forced flat against a window

08:34.135 --> 08:36.696
by three snotsome teenage grotlings

08:36.736 --> 08:39.376
who I <i>knew</i>
had not paid the upgrade,

08:39.416 --> 08:43.176
but for <i>27</i> hours
I had not the <i>gutlings</i> to challenge them!

08:45.176 --> 08:46.776
Harrowing story, master.

08:46.816 --> 08:49.296
You should tell it to a leper
or a plaguey some time.

08:49.336 --> 08:52.376
Might help them take their minds off
their running sores.

08:52.416 --> 08:54.096
You need to count your blessings.

08:54.136 --> 08:57.896
Yes, Bottom, like having a servant
to put my problems into perspective.

08:57.936 --> 09:01.096
So much handier than
having one that can cook an edible pie.

09:02.976 --> 09:07.136
However, I shan't allow anything to dent
my mood today because, guess what,

09:07.176 --> 09:09.336
I am returned with <i>amazing</i> news.

09:09.376 --> 09:11.376
There's to be a theatre awards night!

09:11.416 --> 09:14.176
And since my plays
are currently the only ones running,

09:14.216 --> 09:16.016
I'm bound to scoop the lot!

09:16.056 --> 09:18.656
Goodness!
Congratulations, Mr Shakespeare!

09:18.696 --> 09:21.856
All but one award, actually,
because, believe it or not,

09:21.896 --> 09:24.896
they're going to honour you, Kit,
posthumously,

09:24.936 --> 09:27.976
which, ironically, I also win
because I wrote all your plays.

09:29.016 --> 09:31.056
Clean sweep for me.
Amazing!

09:31.096 --> 09:33.496
Me?
Nominated at an awards ceremony!

09:33.536 --> 09:35.056
<i>Such</i> larks!

09:35.096 --> 09:36.816
Yet I can't go, cos I'm dead.

09:37.816 --> 09:39.696
Curse this ruse of mine.

09:39.736 --> 09:41.096
I wonder who they'll get
to collect it.

09:41.136 --> 09:43.976
Oh, they'll try and get in touch with
some member of your family, I suppose.

09:44.016 --> 09:46.696
No luck there.
All gone to Hell years ago.

09:46.736 --> 09:47.776
Unless...

09:48.976 --> 09:50.016
Unless...

09:50.056 --> 09:53.656
Gadzungles!
I begin to see a way out of my current fix

09:53.696 --> 09:55.976
and enter society once more!

09:56.016 --> 09:59.776
Will Mrs Shakespeare be accompanying you
to the ceremony, Mr Shakespeare?

09:59.816 --> 10:01.696
I'm sure she'd be <i>thrilled</i>.

10:01.736 --> 10:04.536
Well, I...
I know I <i>should</i> ask her, but...

10:04.576 --> 10:08.416
Well, these awards will be
London's most <i>glamorous</i> night in years.

10:08.456 --> 10:11.176
Sophisticated men, beautiful women...

10:11.216 --> 10:13.816
Are you saying you don't think
your <i>wife</i> would be fitting company

10:13.856 --> 10:14.936
for such an occasion?

10:14.976 --> 10:16.976
Duh!
She's a milkmaid.

10:18.216 --> 10:21.456
Mr Shakespeare,
she is your loyal and <i>loving</i> wife!

10:21.496 --> 10:23.016
I <i>cannot</i> believe that you would

10:23.056 --> 10:25.856
<i>not</i> want her on your arm
at your moment of triumph

10:25.896 --> 10:28.496
but would instead seek out
some young tarting-slap.

10:28.536 --> 10:30.136
Have you no decency?

10:30.176 --> 10:31.496
No loyalty?

10:31.536 --> 10:33.936
Come on, Kate,
this is a work night for me,

10:33.976 --> 10:36.176
a chance to get in with the pamperloins

10:36.216 --> 10:39.136
who despise me
as an upstart country bum-shankle.

10:40.136 --> 10:44.296
Having a bit of beautiful, refined
and intelligent young totty on my arm

10:44.336 --> 10:46.016
would really help.

10:46.056 --> 10:48.136
So, what I was wondering, Kate, is...

10:48.176 --> 10:49.616
Oh, my goodly godlingtons!

10:49.656 --> 10:52.536
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

10:52.576 --> 10:54.696
Of course I'll be your tarting-slap!

10:54.736 --> 10:57.616
I can't believe it.
<i>Me</i> going to the theatre awards

10:57.656 --> 10:59.536
with London's <i>leading</i> playwright!

11:00.496 --> 11:02.136
You... You didn't let me finish, Kate.
I...

11:03.136 --> 11:06.536
I was wondering if you'd take a letter
of invitation to Emelia Lanier.

11:06.576 --> 11:10.576
Uh-oh, watch out!
He's back on the gorgeous, sultry Emelia.

11:10.616 --> 11:12.456
The "dark lady" of his smutty poems.

11:12.496 --> 11:13.816
They were not smutty!

11:13.856 --> 11:15.136
Excuse me.

11:15.176 --> 11:17.296
"Wilt thou,
whose will is large and spacious,

11:17.336 --> 11:20.456
"not once vouchsafe
to hide <i>my will</i> in thine?"

11:20.496 --> 11:22.776
Eh?
We all know what you meant.

11:24.776 --> 11:28.776
Yes. Although I still can't believe
you thought a girl would be flattered

11:28.816 --> 11:31.856
to be told she has
a large and spacious lady grotto.

11:33.496 --> 11:37.096
And I <i>also</i> can't believe
you want <i>me</i> to take your invitation round!

11:37.136 --> 11:39.616
Just thought it was a bit classier
than sending Bottom.

11:39.656 --> 11:42.176
I mean, you shouldn't be inviting a woman
<i>other</i> than your wife.

11:42.216 --> 11:44.056
Unless, it seems,
that woman happens to be <i>you</i>.

11:44.096 --> 11:47.136
Yes. Because you don't <i>want</i>
to hide your will in mine,

11:47.176 --> 11:50.536
but you are on record as wanting
to hide it in Emelia Lanier's

11:50.576 --> 11:51.856
large and spacious one.

11:53.616 --> 11:55.296
I thought you were over this "dark lady",
master.

11:55.336 --> 11:57.496
Only by necessity, Botsky.

11:57.536 --> 11:59.656
She hinted that I desired her in vain.

11:59.696 --> 12:01.856
You mean she told you
she wouldn't want to be seen dead

12:01.896 --> 12:04.656
with a fartsome old baldy-boots
from the Midlands like you.

12:04.696 --> 12:06.496
Yes.
That's right.

12:06.536 --> 12:08.416
But she <i>might</i> be prepared
to be seen with me

12:08.456 --> 12:11.416
at the most <i>glamorous</i> night
of London's social calendar.

12:11.456 --> 12:14.496
Right, I'm off to Lucy's
for a celebratory quaff.

12:14.536 --> 12:16.296
Wish I could invite you, Kit, but...

12:16.336 --> 12:18.296
Yes.
I know. I'm <i>dead</i>.

12:18.336 --> 12:19.896
But watch this space, i' faith,

12:19.936 --> 12:22.816
because I've been nominated
for a posthumous theatre award.

12:22.856 --> 12:24.616
This bad boy's back in the game.

12:29.096 --> 12:30.936
Mr Burbage not here, Miss Lucy?

12:30.976 --> 12:32.816
Nor Condell or Kempe?

12:32.856 --> 12:35.136
They rarely miss their Sunday-night quaff.

12:35.176 --> 12:38.816
They have a gig, Mr Shakespeare.
Private function at the Inns of Court.

12:38.856 --> 12:42.216
Oh, I see.
Some spoilt little girl's 21st, no doubt,

12:42.256 --> 12:44.816
and doting Daddy has booked
the big London stars

12:44.856 --> 12:46.976
to do the arse-kicking routine
at midnight.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.456
Personally, I think that sort of gig
is <i>totally</i> selling out.

12:50.496 --> 12:52.016
You mean, being the writer,

12:52.056 --> 12:54.536
nobody ever pays you a fortune
to do a celebrity gig

12:54.576 --> 12:57.176
and you are eaten up
with resentment and jealousy.

12:57.216 --> 12:59.016
Yes, that's it, exactly.

12:59.056 --> 13:02.296
Anyway, ale, if you please, Miss Lucy,
and pie.

13:02.336 --> 13:06.536
I'm celebrating being nominated in
<i>all</i> categories at the London Theatre Awards,

13:06.576 --> 13:09.936
which I'm <i>certain</i> to win,
as there appear to be <i>no</i> rival contenders.

13:11.756 --> 13:13.136
No rivals?

13:13.406 --> 13:14.736
Where is the <i>fun</i> in that?

13:14.776 --> 13:17.536
In my village,
the winner of any contest

13:17.576 --> 13:22.936
was expected to <i>cut</i> off the head
of his rival and boil the brains for soup.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.576
Goodness, Lucy.
Can such savagery be true?

13:25.916 --> 13:28.496
Of course not.
I make up that stuff for the tourists.

13:28.536 --> 13:31.736
It is actually customary
for the victor to say to the rival,

13:31.776 --> 13:34.416
"No, really, you should have won,
you were much better.

13:34.456 --> 13:36.136
"I was just lucky, really."

13:37.076 --> 13:38.896
I can see that
is a less interesting anecdote.

13:43.246 --> 13:45.456
Can't believe Emelia's actually coming!

13:45.496 --> 13:46.496
First time I've met her

13:46.536 --> 13:50.136
since the unfortunate misunderstanding
over sonnet number 130.

13:50.176 --> 13:52.776
When you mentioned her eyes
were dull, her hair like wire,

13:52.816 --> 13:55.856
her skin a dullish grey
and her breath reeked?

13:55.896 --> 13:58.376
Yes.
And, <i>amazingly</i>, she failed to spot

13:58.416 --> 14:01.016
that I was <i>satirising</i>
traditional romantic poetry.

14:01.056 --> 14:02.576
You've asked her round pretty early.

14:02.616 --> 14:04.576
The awards aren't for hours.

14:04.616 --> 14:07.536
Are you hoping to grab a chance
to hide your will in hers?

14:07.576 --> 14:10.896
No!
I... I'm taking her to supper at Lucy's.

14:10.936 --> 14:12.096
What a night!

14:12.136 --> 14:14.536
Dinner with
a beautiful, sophisticated girl,

14:14.576 --> 14:18.696
then showing her off during my triumph
at a star-studded awards ceremony.

14:18.736 --> 14:20.816
It <i>does</i> not get any <i>better</i> than this!

14:20.856 --> 14:25.376
Mr Shakespeare, I <i>really</i> think you need
to remember that you are a <i>married man</i>!

14:25.416 --> 14:26.936
Look, I'm just taking her to dinner.

14:26.976 --> 14:29.256
You can tell yourself that if you like,
Mr Shakespeare,

14:29.296 --> 14:32.616
but you and I <i>both</i> know that,
given half the chance, you'd be <i>in</i> there

14:32.656 --> 14:35.016
like the eager rodent
up the proverbial piping drain!

14:37.416 --> 14:39.736
Oh, God, she's here!
This is it!

14:39.776 --> 14:42.896
I'm actually going to take Emelia Lanier
on a glamorous night out.

14:42.936 --> 14:44.136
Master...

14:44.176 --> 14:47.056
Madam,
this is the <i>greatest</i> moment of my life.

14:47.096 --> 14:51.496
Well, that's nice, love,
because I <i>have</i> made a bit of an effort.

14:52.006 --> 14:53.156
Anne!

14:53.536 --> 14:55.596
- You're in London?
- Yes.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.096
Well, I was sorry that I've been
so cross about your big night,

14:59.136 --> 15:01.696
and when you made me change the date
of Hamnet's confirmation

15:01.736 --> 15:04.176
I decided I'd come and support you.

15:04.216 --> 15:07.576
Like you said,
it's the greatest moment of your life.

15:08.096 --> 15:09.136
What?

15:09.176 --> 15:11.376
Oh, yes, of course.
Yeah.

15:11.416 --> 15:15.656
In fact, it's <i>almost</i> like
you were expecting somebody.

15:15.696 --> 15:17.776
Are you expecting somebody, Will?

15:17.816 --> 15:19.416
No!
Of <i>course</i> not.

15:21.416 --> 15:22.536
Who's <i>that</i>, then?

15:22.576 --> 15:26.816
Nobody! Kate, run and tell Bottom
to make sure there's nobody at the door,

15:26.856 --> 15:29.056
and if there is,
tell them I've got the plague.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.176
You stay <i>right</i> where you are, Kate!

15:31.216 --> 15:35.096
If there's nobody there, then it won't
matter if we find out who it is, will it?

15:35.136 --> 15:37.456
Master...
It... It... It's...

15:37.496 --> 15:39.296
Mr Shakespeare!

15:39.606 --> 15:43.176
I'm so looking forward
to coming to the awards ceremony.

15:45.616 --> 15:49.496
Oh, my God, it's that tart
you wrote them smutty poems for!

15:50.536 --> 15:52.376
I <i>beg</i> your pardon?!

15:52.416 --> 15:53.576
William?

15:53.616 --> 15:55.776
Who is this oikish milking-slap?

15:57.256 --> 15:58.896
It's Mr Shakespeare's wife, Emelia.

15:58.936 --> 16:01.176
No doubt come to accompany him
to tonight's awards.

16:01.216 --> 16:05.736
Perhaps you and Mrs S would like
to join me and Emelia for dinner.

16:05.776 --> 16:07.216
Kit Marlowe!

16:08.836 --> 16:10.896
I thought you were dead!

16:10.936 --> 16:14.736
The resemblance is <i>shocking</i>, I know,
but <i>not</i> Kit...

16:15.016 --> 16:16.156
Kurt.

16:17.496 --> 16:21.296
His ravishing blond twin invited to the
awards ceremony to collect Kit's award,

16:21.336 --> 16:24.936
which was why I asked Will
to invite you on my behalf.

16:24.976 --> 16:27.936
You meant so much to Kit, after all.

16:27.976 --> 16:30.416
Well, yes.
I remember his poem.

16:30.456 --> 16:34.496
"Emelia, Emelia,
by <i>God</i>, I'd like to feel ya."

16:36.016 --> 16:39.136
<i>So</i> much better
than Mr Shakespeare's disgusting sonnet

16:39.176 --> 16:41.416
about putting his <i>will</i> in my...

16:41.456 --> 16:43.256
Well, <i>exactly</i>.

16:43.296 --> 16:47.496
Will and I were hoping that
you would be <i>my</i> date in memory of Kit.

16:48.496 --> 16:51.136
- Isn't that right, Will?
- Yes, absolutely.

16:51.176 --> 16:55.016
I'd thought to go alone,
but now you are here, my darling Anne,

16:55.056 --> 16:57.256
things <i>couldn't</i> be merrier.

17:01.306 --> 17:07.175
I'm having a lovely time <i>quaffing</i> ale
and <i>gorging</i> pie in a London tavern!

17:07.215 --> 17:09.016
Who'd have thought it, eh?

17:09.056 --> 17:12.576
Me, a <i>common</i> milk-slap from Stratford?

17:15.496 --> 17:19.415
D'you know, I think I'll spend
some more time with you in town, Will,

17:19.455 --> 17:20.896
now that the kids are getting older.

17:21.126 --> 17:23.976
- Won't that be wonderful?
- Yes, my love.

17:26.056 --> 17:27.656
Wonderful.

17:29.346 --> 17:32.296
Will and...
<i>Good God</i>, it's a ghost!

17:32.336 --> 17:34.376
No ghost, Mr Burbage.

17:34.416 --> 17:37.616
I'm Kit's brother, Kurt,
come to collect his posthumous award.

17:37.656 --> 17:39.456
Well, you've certainly got
the better hair.

17:39.496 --> 17:41.456
Well...

17:41.496 --> 17:45.856
Welcome, Kurt, and an exciting night
of awards ahead, I think.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.376
Exciting?
Don't think so.

17:48.416 --> 17:51.496
Not Italian, is it?
It's just London, so...

17:51.536 --> 17:53.616
Shut up, Kempe.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.536
Are you nervous, Mr Shakespeare?

17:55.576 --> 17:59.496
Like the tired antelope who thought
his wife nodded at a leafy glade

17:59.536 --> 18:01.216
and said,
"Lie down there,"

18:01.256 --> 18:04.336
only to discover she said,
"<i>Lion</i> down there."

18:04.376 --> 18:06.736
'Tis <i>I</i> who am the lion tonight,
Miss Lucy.

18:06.776 --> 18:09.096
All the other companies left town
during the last plague

18:09.136 --> 18:10.456
and are still touring.

18:10.496 --> 18:13.056
I can't see that there's actually going to be
<i>any</i> other nominations at all.

18:13.096 --> 18:15.616
Can you think of any
<i>recent</i> productions, Burbage?

18:15.656 --> 18:18.656
Any <i>one-off</i> Sunday-night revivals?

18:21.556 --> 18:24.096
Mrs Shakespeare!
<i>So</i> glad I caught you.

18:24.136 --> 18:26.416
I'm afraid a letter has followed you
from Stratford.

18:26.456 --> 18:30.656
Nothing <i>serious</i>, it says,
but Susanna and Judith are both a bit feverish.

18:30.696 --> 18:32.056
Your mother-in-law says not to worry

18:32.096 --> 18:34.216
but that she'd feel <i>better</i>
if you were to come home.

18:34.256 --> 18:35.536
Oh, dear.

18:35.576 --> 18:37.736
Oh, how disappointing!

18:37.776 --> 18:39.216
Who'd be a mum, eh?

18:39.256 --> 18:41.296
Oh, I'm sorry, Will.

18:41.336 --> 18:45.736
I <i>so</i> wanted to support you
on your big night, but <i>good</i> luck.

18:45.776 --> 18:49.896
And don't forget Hamnet's confirmation,
and you come home just as soon as you can.

18:49.936 --> 18:51.096
Of course, wife.

18:51.136 --> 18:54.696
Burdened down by many an
interestingly shaped statuette, no doubt.

18:57.376 --> 18:59.936
Well, now,
<i>very</i> sorry to see her go.

18:59.976 --> 19:01.336
Very sorry indeed.

19:01.376 --> 19:03.536
But it occurs to me, Emelia,

19:03.576 --> 19:06.496
that it <i>does</i> mean that you can now
be my guest, as <i>planned</i>.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.616
I kind of think I'll stick where I am.

19:10.976 --> 19:12.376
Oh, right.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.876
<i>So</i>, Mr Shakespeare...

19:16.016 --> 19:18.376
<i>One</i> spare ticket, eh?

19:18.416 --> 19:20.816
<i>If</i> you were in need
of some highly attractive

19:20.856 --> 19:22.816
and sophisticated young totty...

19:22.856 --> 19:24.496
Yes, I am, Kate.
Do you know any?

19:25.656 --> 19:26.776
I mean <i>me</i>!

19:26.816 --> 19:29.216
Oh! Yes, right.
Of course.

19:33.656 --> 19:35.376
Yeah, all right, hello.

19:35.416 --> 19:39.616
Welcome to the famous Red Lion Theatre for
the first annual London Theatre Awards.

19:39.656 --> 19:40.896
I'm Will Kempe, yeah?

19:40.936 --> 19:42.696
I'm brilliant, by the way.
Just saying.

19:43.636 --> 19:44.856
Oh, look at you all!

19:44.896 --> 19:47.056
All thinking,
"Ooh, I really hope I win!"

19:47.096 --> 19:49.536
What for?
For being rubbish at acting?

19:51.136 --> 19:54.216
What's the difference between you lot
and Mary Queen of Scots?

19:54.256 --> 19:56.936
She only died horribly
in front of a large crowd <i>once</i>.

19:59.056 --> 20:02.096
I see Sir Francis Drake's just been
buried at sea off Cádiz in full armour.

20:02.136 --> 20:03.936
I bet he went down
better than most of you lot.

20:05.776 --> 20:07.936
I think he's misjudged
the mood of the room.

20:07.976 --> 20:10.136
I think he's <i>brilliant</i>.
<i>So</i> dry.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.296
So <i>edgy</i>.

20:11.336 --> 20:12.576
He's just being rude.

20:12.616 --> 20:15.056
Anyway, lovely to be here.

20:15.096 --> 20:17.576
Well, what I mean is,
lovely to be <i>paid</i> to be here.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.336
I can't think of any other reason.

20:19.376 --> 20:21.016
Unless you're some desperate
old luvvie-kissie

20:21.056 --> 20:23.376
who'll go anywhere for a free drink,
like most of you lot.

20:26.296 --> 20:28.696
Why are they laughing?
He's saying they're all desperate.

20:28.736 --> 20:30.256
He's just so <i>out there</i>.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.696
Just <i>doesn't</i> care.
Such a cooling dude.

20:32.736 --> 20:34.976
He's just being
arrogant and unpleasant.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.496
He's just so dry and edgy.

20:36.536 --> 20:37.856
He's <i>not</i> dry and edgy.

20:37.896 --> 20:40.776
He's just slagging everyone off
for being a pampered luvvie-kissie,

20:40.816 --> 20:44.456
even though beneath the thin veneer
of post-Renaissance ironic cool

20:44.496 --> 20:47.096
<i>he's</i> the biggest pampered
luvvie-kissie of the <i>lot</i>.

20:47.136 --> 20:50.496
And if there's <i>one</i> thing more irritating
than being a pampered luvvie-kissie

20:50.536 --> 20:53.496
attending a gala evening
<i>for</i> pampered luvvie-kissies,

20:53.536 --> 20:56.056
being slagged off
<i>by</i> a pampered luvvie-kissie,

20:56.096 --> 20:58.536
it's having all the <i>other</i> pampered
luvvie-kissies in the room

20:58.576 --> 21:01.616
pretending to be <i>wryly</i> amused
and <i>in</i> on the joke

21:01.656 --> 21:06.056
in the <i>desperate</i> hope that it'll make them
look <i>less</i> like pampered luvvie-kissies.

21:06.096 --> 21:08.176
Well, I <i>like</i>
being a pampered luvvie-kissie.

21:08.216 --> 21:11.496
I amuse people for a living
and never killed anyone,

21:11.536 --> 21:14.616
and when I win all my interestingly shaped
statuettes tonight,

21:14.656 --> 21:17.736
I'm not going to pretend that I think
that everyone else is as good as me,

21:17.776 --> 21:19.096
because I <i>don't</i>.

21:19.136 --> 21:21.976
And I'm not going to <i>bang on</i>
about suffering and poverty,

21:22.016 --> 21:25.136
because it's neither my <i>fault</i>
nor in my power to change!

21:25.176 --> 21:28.896
I'm going to whoop and cheer
and <i>possibly</i> do a little victory dance,

21:28.936 --> 21:31.576
because I'm bloomin' best
and I want a prize.

21:32.736 --> 21:36.456
So...
First bit of pointless self-congratulation...

21:36.496 --> 21:38.256
Sorry, I meant <i>award</i>...

21:38.296 --> 21:39.816
is the best revival.

21:39.856 --> 21:42.016
And to present it, we've got an actor

21:42.056 --> 21:44.616
who has done a lot to stop starvation.
Yeah?

21:44.656 --> 21:46.216
By eating all the pies!

21:47.336 --> 21:49.696
Please welcome Dickie Burbage.

21:56.376 --> 21:59.976
And the nominations
for best revival are...

22:01.136 --> 22:04.056
Richard III, by Will Shakespeare,
currently enjoying

22:04.096 --> 22:06.816
its fifth triumphant season
in London repertory.

22:06.856 --> 22:09.416
Oh, God, I <i>so</i> didn't expect to win this,

22:09.456 --> 22:11.096
I haven't prepared a speech <i>at all</i>.

22:11.136 --> 22:14.096
...and Friar Bacon And Friar Bungay
by Robert Greene,

22:14.136 --> 22:17.656
performed for one night only
at the refectory in the Inns of Court.

22:18.256 --> 22:20.496
- What?!
- And the winner is...

22:20.536 --> 22:23.336
Robert Greene,
Friar Bacon And Friar Bungay!

22:27.176 --> 22:30.376
So sorry, Mr Shakespeare.
I know you wanted to win so much.

22:30.416 --> 22:34.096
Nonsense. Like it matters. As if.
It's all crappage anyway.

22:34.136 --> 22:37.096
Besides, that was only for a revival.
I'll win everything else.

22:37.136 --> 22:39.576
The nominations for best tragedy are...

22:39.616 --> 22:42.216
Julius Caesar, by Will Shakespeare...

22:42.256 --> 22:43.496
And the winner is...

22:44.576 --> 22:47.736
Robert Greene,
Friar Bacon And Friar Bungay.

22:48.996 --> 22:52.496
Nominations for best comedy...
Much Ado About Nothing, by Will Shakespeare...

22:52.536 --> 22:53.976
The winner is...

22:54.016 --> 22:56.256
Robert Greene,
Friar Bacon And Friar Bungay.

22:58.616 --> 23:00.216
Best actor in a male role...

23:00.256 --> 23:01.696
Richard Burbage

23:01.736 --> 23:05.136
for Friar Bacon in Robert Greene's
Friar Bacon And Friar Bungay.

23:05.176 --> 23:09.016
Will Kempe as Ralph Simnel
in Robert Greene's Friar Bacon...

23:10.936 --> 23:16.536
...and I intend to make an absolute
<i>beast</i> of myself at the afterparty

23:16.576 --> 23:17.696
in his honour!

23:18.776 --> 23:21.456
Henry Condell
for the Fair Maid of Fressingfield

23:21.496 --> 23:23.736
in Robert Greene's
Friar Bacon And Friar...

23:23.776 --> 23:26.776
As an actor who plays female roles,

23:26.816 --> 23:31.736
I would like to accept this on behalf
of <i>all</i> actors who play female roles.

23:31.776 --> 23:35.176
Their courage, their strength,
their passion.

23:35.216 --> 23:39.856
We need <i>more</i> and <i>better</i> roles
for actors who play female roles.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.736
We are <i>not</i> just the totty.

23:41.776 --> 23:44.776
We are <i>not</i> just eccentric old ladies.

23:44.816 --> 23:47.456
We are strong, we are passionate,

23:47.496 --> 23:50.256
and we demand an <i>equal</i> voice
in this industry.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.601
<i>Be</i> angry!

23:51.641 --> 23:52.886
<i>Be</i> fierce!

23:52.926 --> 23:54.856
<i>Dare</i> to dream!

23:54.896 --> 23:56.096
Thank you.

24:05.516 --> 24:07.096
Yes, it's me.

24:07.136 --> 24:10.496
I'm home, and, no, since you ask,
I did <i>not</i> have a good journey.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.616
My coach was <i>massively</i> delayed
out of Long Compton because of,

24:13.656 --> 24:17.656
and I quote,
"the <i>late</i> arrival of the <i>incoming</i> service".

24:17.696 --> 24:20.136
And this, mark you,
was offered as an excuse,

24:20.176 --> 24:22.336
as if <i>somehow</i>
that made everything all right.

24:22.376 --> 24:23.936
"The <i>incoming</i> service was late.

24:23.976 --> 24:25.376
"Whoopee!
We're off the hook.

24:25.416 --> 24:27.336
"All guilt be absolved."

24:27.376 --> 24:31.096
Except, hang on, who exactly
was <i>running</i> this incoming service?

24:31.136 --> 24:33.936
Genghis Khan,
the Bishop of Bath and Wells,

24:33.976 --> 24:36.576
the recently encountered
Cherokee and Mohawk tribes

24:36.616 --> 24:38.416
of the North American Seaboard?

24:38.456 --> 24:41.776
No! The <i>same</i> people who are running
my <i>outgoing</i> coach.

24:41.816 --> 24:44.256
<i>Two</i> late coaches
does <i>not</i> make it better.

24:44.296 --> 24:46.056
Imagine if I tried that
in the theatre.

24:46.096 --> 24:47.976
"Sorry, no play tonight,
I haven't written it.

24:48.016 --> 24:50.456
"But don't worry,
I haven't written the <i>previous</i> one either."

24:51.476 --> 24:53.576
Well, hello to you lot, too,
thanks very much.

24:53.616 --> 24:56.056
And since you asked,
no, I didn't win any prizes,

24:56.096 --> 24:59.416
because Robert Greene got
all his Oxbridge mates to vote for him.

24:59.456 --> 25:00.936
Well, Bolingbrokes to the lot of them!

25:00.976 --> 25:04.373
I am returned, as promised,
for Hamnet's confirmation, so let us...

25:04.413 --> 25:05.596
Dad!

25:06.336 --> 25:07.440
Daughter?

25:08.896 --> 25:10.576
Hamnet's dead.

25:12.176 --> 25:14.056
Dead?

25:15.296 --> 25:17.536
Plague, husband.

25:17.576 --> 25:18.856
Our one in three.

25:20.376 --> 25:25.936
I thank a merciful God that he left us
Susanna and Judith to be our comfort.

25:25.976 --> 25:27.096
Merciful God?

25:28.136 --> 25:31.096
- <i>Merciful</i> God?
- Don't, husband.

25:31.136 --> 25:33.016
Don't hate God,
nor, worse, deny him.

25:33.056 --> 25:34.656
I owe God nothing.

25:35.736 --> 25:37.256
Our son is <i>lost</i> to us!

25:37.296 --> 25:39.576
Not lost, never lost.

25:39.616 --> 25:41.216
Just gone before.

25:41.256 --> 25:44.736
I have to believe that, Will,
and that God is merciful.

25:46.176 --> 25:47.536
Otherwise I can't...

25:49.056 --> 25:50.256
I can't...

25:50.696 --> 25:52.496
He didn't suffer long, William.

25:52.536 --> 25:53.996
A single night.

25:54.736 --> 25:57.856
It began...
<i>just</i> before sunset.

25:57.896 --> 25:59.896
And he left us as the sun rose.

26:01.846 --> 26:04.336
He said he'd see you in Heaven, Dad.

26:04.376 --> 26:07.856
But that you weren't to rush,
cos he knew how busy you are.

26:08.816 --> 26:11.296
He said we could have
his confirmation then.

26:11.336 --> 26:14.056
So just you tell me you believe, husband.

26:14.096 --> 26:16.256
Tell me you believe we'll see him again,

26:16.296 --> 26:20.376
that God took him for a purpose
and that one day we'll be reunited!

26:21.536 --> 26:23.096
You're the clever one.

26:23.136 --> 26:26.416
You always know the answers,
so tell me you believe!

26:28.896 --> 26:30.256
Yes, Anne.

26:31.416 --> 26:32.936
Yes, of <i>course</i> I believe.

26:34.496 --> 26:39.176
Such a light as shone in our son
couldn't be extinguished in an instant.

26:39.216 --> 26:42.376
It shines bright and clear in Heaven.

26:42.416 --> 26:44.536
We'll see it in the stars tonight.

26:44.576 --> 26:46.656
And they will guide us to him

26:46.696 --> 26:48.656
when our <i>own</i> time comes.

26:50.056 --> 26:51.256
Yes.

26:51.296 --> 26:52.416
Yes, they will.

26:54.936 --> 26:58.056
In the meantime, in the morning
there'll be the cow to milk

26:58.096 --> 27:00.736
and maize to grind and fires to set.

27:02.096 --> 27:06.056
There isn't a family in England
that hasn't got empty places at the table.

27:06.596 --> 27:08.656
And we have only <i>one</i>.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.008
Like I said...

27:11.048 --> 27:12.736
God <i>is</i> merciful.

27:18.936 --> 27:20.176
<i>Do</i> you, Dad?

27:20.616 --> 27:21.856
Daughter?

27:22.326 --> 27:25.616
Do you <i>really</i> believe
that Hamnet's light still shines?

27:25.656 --> 27:27.096
Yes, Sue.

27:27.136 --> 27:31.896
In you, in Judith,
in his mother's heart, and in mine.

27:31.936 --> 27:35.256
In... In every thought we have
and breath we take,

27:35.296 --> 27:37.296
as long as we live.

27:38.036 --> 27:40.116
But in <i>Heaven</i>, Dad?

27:40.456 --> 27:42.776
Do you believe we'll <i>see</i> him again?

27:43.026 --> 27:47.256
To <i>hold</i> him and <i>kiss</i> him,
to <i>shout</i> at him and <i>scold</i> him?

27:49.176 --> 27:50.896
No, daughter, I don't.

27:52.576 --> 27:54.576
But your mother does.

27:55.536 --> 27:58.096
And for all that she says
<i>I'm</i> the clever one,

27:58.136 --> 28:01.336
in <i>my</i> experience,
she's right about most things.

28:08.696 --> 28:13.256
Grief fills the room up
of my absent child.

28:13.296 --> 28:17.896
Lies in his bed,
walks up and down with me,

28:17.936 --> 28:21.736
puts on his pretty looks,
repeats his words,

28:21.816 --> 28:25.416
remembers me
of all his gracious parts,

28:25.456 --> 28:29.056
stuffs out his vacant garments
with his form.

28:30.466 --> 28:34.106
<i>Then</i>, have I reason to be fond of grief?
