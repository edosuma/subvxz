{\an1}Are these guys ever
going to give up?

01:39.098 --> 01:40.350
The police are just
spinning their wheels.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.019
{\an6}There's no way
they're gonna figure out
who hit that computer

01:43.102 --> 01:44.521
{\an3}just like they're not gonna
figure out who hit me.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.189
You don't think so?

01:46.272 --> 01:48.024
Come on. The big interrogation

01:48.107 --> 01:49.692
of the computer class
was a total bust.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.694
And me trying to track down
a legacy key

01:51.778 --> 01:53.029
that probably didn't even exist.

01:53.112 --> 01:55.031
Mm, a legacy key?

01:55.114 --> 01:57.534
Sounds very James Bond.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.369
There's supposed
to be a master key

01:59.452 --> 02:00.870
that's been passed down
through the decades,

02:00.954 --> 02:02.372
but since all the locks
have been changed this year,

02:02.455 --> 02:04.999
there goes that theory.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.793
Oh, well.

02:06.876 --> 02:09.211
Easy come, easy go, right?

02:09.294 --> 02:12.173
I didn't expect Dylan
to send me a postcard.

02:12.257 --> 02:13.716
{\an1}After all, we did
not break up

02:13.800 --> 02:14.843
on the best of terms,

02:14.926 --> 02:16.845
{\an1}but nobody's heard anything
from him in three days.

02:16.928 --> 02:17.554
Well, he did seem
ready to explode

02:17.637 --> 02:19.389
{\an3}when he stormed
out of here.

02:19.472 --> 02:20.849
Yeah, and when Dylan gets
like that,

02:20.932 --> 02:22.350
his first impulse is to go
straight for the bottle.

02:23.768 --> 02:24.894
So are you still up

02:24.978 --> 02:26.271
{\an1}for going
to David's showcase tonight?

02:26.354 --> 02:28.273
{\an1}I think it might take
your mind off everything.

02:28.356 --> 02:30.358
Is Kelly going?

02:30.441 --> 02:33.403
{\an1}You know, Bren,
Dylan or no Dylan,

02:33.486 --> 02:35.738
{\an1}I think you two
are acting very juvenile.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.740
Donna, if Kelly's going,

02:37.824 --> 02:41.119
{\an3}wild horses
couldn't drag me there.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.580
(sighs)

02:43.663 --> 02:45.081
Damn.

03:12.483 --> 03:16.446
(horse whinnies)

03:22.619 --> 03:25.079
{\an3}Nice car.

03:25.163 --> 03:25.622
Nice horse.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.749
Borrowed or stolen?

03:27.832 --> 03:28.625
Doesn't really matter.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.210
{\an1}I mean, it's not going
anywhere either way.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.756
Is there a phone
around here somewhere?

03:34.839 --> 03:37.467
There's one back at the ranch.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.468
I'm Anne.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.761
I'm Dylan.

03:44.849 --> 03:45.475
Climb on up.

04:00.698 --> 04:01.532
(horse whinnies)

04:01.616 --> 04:03.493
Didn't I tell you not to worry?

04:03.576 --> 04:04.494
Didn't I tell you

04:04.577 --> 04:06.537
this whole thing
would blow over?

04:06.621 --> 04:08.122
{\an3}Well, why are
the cops still here?

04:08.206 --> 04:09.123
It's a dog-and-pony show.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.000
We are home free, okay?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.669
{\an1}Just like your good
old senior buddy promised.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.087
{\an3}Thank God.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.005
{\an3}This has been the
worst week of my life.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.548
I'll talk to you later.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.386
Andrea told me the whole legacy
key thing's a dead issue.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.972
Big surprise.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.515
Well, the only thing
surprising to me

04:25.598 --> 04:28.226
is how I got a foot that big
into a mouth this small.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.560
Brandon, if you're trying
to apologize

04:29.644 --> 04:30.561
for calling me a liar
and a thief,

04:30.645 --> 04:33.356
don't you think you could grovel
a little more?

04:33.439 --> 04:34.524
Don't press

04:34.607 --> 04:36.025
your luck, pal.

04:36.109 --> 04:36.985
Hey, stranger.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.486
{\an3}Hey, Nikki, when are you
gonna dump this bum

04:38.569 --> 04:39.445
and get a real man?

04:39.529 --> 04:41.823
Oh, is Mel Gibson available?

04:41.906 --> 04:43.783
See why I like this girl?

04:45.576 --> 04:47.578
(chuckles)

04:47.662 --> 04:48.705
{\an3}Hey, guys.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.164
{\an1}David, Brandon
and I are gonna be

04:50.248 --> 04:51.207
at the showcase tonight.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.542
Yeah, so you better
not choke.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.544
Gee, thanks for the
vote of confidence.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.045
{\an1}You're bigger
than huge, babe.

04:56.129 --> 04:56.546
{\an3}Hey, back
at you, babe.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.547
(Brandon laughs)

04:57.630 --> 05:00.425
{\an3}Sanders, I just called
the promoter

05:00.508 --> 05:01.551
to find out what time

05:01.634 --> 05:03.886
we have to be in
for sound check

05:03.970 --> 05:05.096
{\an3}and they hadn't
even heard

05:05.179 --> 05:06.139
{\an3}of David Silver
and The Commotions.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.558
{\an3}Would you relax and let me
handle your career?

05:08.641 --> 05:09.851
{\an3}When you called
these guys,

05:09.934 --> 05:10.560
did you identify
yourself as a member

05:10.643 --> 05:13.438
{\an3}of the Sanders
Management Team?

05:13.521 --> 05:14.897
Are you jerking me around here?

05:14.981 --> 05:17.358
You wanna stand here while I
call them and straighten it out?

05:17.442 --> 05:18.401
Just take care of it, okay?

05:18.484 --> 05:19.569
{\an3}I will.
Trust me.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.759
Hi. I'm Steve Sanders from
the Sanders Management Team.

05:42.842 --> 05:43.801
Look, I know I'm calling
kind of late,

05:43.885 --> 05:46.929
but is there any way
I can book one of my acts

05:47.013 --> 05:49.057
into your showcase tonight?

05:49.140 --> 05:50.641
How much is this
gonna set me back?

05:57.774 --> 06:01.778
{\an5}DYLAN:
<i>No, no, listen, I don't need</i>
<i>you to install it. I...</i>

06:01.861 --> 06:06.240
Okay, If that's the best you can
do, I'll see you tomorrow.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.867
{\an1}He doesn't sound
very accommodating.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.452
Well, he's not.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.621
{\an3}He told me ten times
that he only stocks parts

06:11.704 --> 06:13.748
for American cars.

06:13.831 --> 06:14.791
Welcome to the sticks.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.627
Is there someplace I could stay
around here?

06:17.710 --> 06:20.630
There's a motel down the road.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.260
Or you could, uh, stay
in the guest house.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.683
You sure that
wouldn't be any trouble?

06:32.767 --> 06:35.812
I don't think the cook
or the ranch hands would mind,

06:35.895 --> 06:38.523
so if you want permission
from the owner, you just got it.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.693
Okay.

06:47.740 --> 06:48.616
(car horn blares)

06:52.703 --> 06:53.412
There are a lot
of heavyweights

06:53.496 --> 06:54.789
{\an3}from the music biz
here tonight.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.082
How can you tell?

06:56.165 --> 06:58.167
They're the short bald guys
with sunglasses.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.836
No, this is really
an industry crowd.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.171
{\an6}The business
is always looking
for new talent.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.549
God, David must be so excited!

07:04.632 --> 07:06.926
That's just great. You didn't
tell me we'd be up first.

07:07.009 --> 07:08.553
We didn't even get
a sound check yet!

07:08.636 --> 07:09.846
David, it's a dirty business,
all right?

07:09.929 --> 07:10.638
{\an1}Look, I had to pay
through the nose

07:10.721 --> 07:12.807
{\an1}to get you on the bill
to begin with.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.058
Just be glad you're here.

07:14.142 --> 07:16.018
{\an5}Yeah, well, that's
more than I can say
for my equipment.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.395
It's not even
set up right!

07:17.478 --> 07:18.604
{\an1}It's gonna happen,
all right?!

07:18.688 --> 07:21.524
Wasn't this gig supposed to
start like half an hour ago?

07:21.607 --> 07:23.484
You know Hollywood.
Everything's fashionably late.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.695
{\an1}I know it's probably
not a good time,

07:25.778 --> 07:27.029
{\an1}but have you heard
from Dylan?

07:27.113 --> 07:28.739
No, not since he split.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.699
I'm worried about him.

07:29.782 --> 07:33.536
Yeah, me, too.

07:33.619 --> 07:35.538
{\an3}I'm also worried
about you and Bren.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.499
There's nothing to worry about.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.543
We decided that if we never talk
to each other again,

07:40.626 --> 07:41.544
it'll be too soon.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.880
That's funny.
That's exactly what she said.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.674
Really?
What else did she say?

07:48.843 --> 07:50.428
Kel...

07:50.511 --> 07:51.929
{\an3}you know I love you
like a sister,

07:52.013 --> 07:55.016
{\an3}but I also love my sister
like a sister.

07:55.099 --> 07:57.018
That's okay.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.519
I won't hold it against you.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.938
{\an5}EMCEE:
Are you ready
to have some fun, huh?

08:01.022 --> 08:03.065
All right,
let's get things underway.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.109
Right now we're gonna bring on
our first act.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.863

08:58.704 --> 09:01.249
So, you all alone here
at the Ponderosa?

09:01.332 --> 09:02.541
No, I'm not married,

09:02.625 --> 09:04.460
{\an1}if that's what
you're asking, Dylan.

09:04.543 --> 09:07.129
{\an3}That's not what
I'm asking.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.840
What are you asking?

09:09.924 --> 09:12.468
{\an3}I just thought you might get
a little lonely out here.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.678
I like the quiet.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.763
Where are you from?

09:15.846 --> 09:17.765
Why?

09:17.848 --> 09:21.560
I'm just curious.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.771
Sorry.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.857
How old are you anyway?

09:27.858 --> 09:30.695
Why?

09:30.945 --> 09:33.864
(laughing)

09:33.948 --> 09:36.867
{\an1}Two points for the guy
with the "borrowed" car.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.996
You think I stole that car?

09:40.079 --> 09:42.790
I don't know.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.876
{\an3}Well, then what exactly
is your take on me,

09:45.960 --> 09:47.920
Ms. Beresford?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.672
{\an1}I think you're
misunderstood...

09:49.755 --> 09:51.674
unappreciated.

09:51.757 --> 09:54.176
A little bored.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.678
A little angry.

09:55.761 --> 09:59.515
Like me, you don't like
being told what to do.

09:59.598 --> 10:01.851
Good read.

10:01.934 --> 10:02.852
I'm very literate, Dylan.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.563
And I'll bet

10:05.646 --> 10:07.023
{\an1}whatever you left
back there deserved

10:07.106 --> 10:08.232
to be left back there.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.692
{\an1}You knew it was time
to get out

10:09.775 --> 10:11.360
{\an1}and taste what you want
from life.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.653
Which is?

10:12.737 --> 10:14.655
Freedom...

10:14.739 --> 10:17.908
the one thing money can buy.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.788
Well, at least
he looked good.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.666
Are you sure they weren't
making those noises on purpose?

10:25.750 --> 10:27.376
{\an1}I mean, what's,
what's that thing they do?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.210
{\an3}Sampling?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.671
No, I've been around
enough bands

10:30.755 --> 10:31.881
{\an3}to know that nobody
samples feedback.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.884
So, uh, what do we tell him
when he gets back to the table?

10:34.967 --> 10:37.845
{\an1}I think we should
tell him the truth.

10:37.928 --> 10:38.971
{\an1}I mean, we're not helping
David as an artist

10:39.055 --> 10:42.058
{\an1}by letting him think this was
one of his better efforts.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.101
{\an3}I'm never gonna
forgive you for this!

10:44.185 --> 10:45.895
{\an3}Or we could lie
through our teeth.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.271
{\an1}STEVE:
David, it's not my fault

10:47.355 --> 10:48.439
they put you on first!

10:48.522 --> 10:48.898
It was the pits.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.775
No, it wasn't.

10:50.858 --> 10:51.776
That's solid.

10:51.859 --> 10:53.736
{\an3}Definitely.
Killer song, bro.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.570
Yeah, you were great.

10:54.653 --> 10:55.738
{\an3}You see.

10:55.821 --> 10:57.281
Look, an artist is always
his toughest critic.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.033
Listen, I love you guys, okay,

10:59.116 --> 11:00.951
{\an1}but you've gotta be
the worst group of liars

11:01.035 --> 11:01.744
{\an1}I've ever met
in my entire life.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.080
David,

11:04.163 --> 11:05.289
you're overreacting.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.749
Oh, yeah?

11:06.832 --> 11:08.292
Well, read my lips.
You're fired.

11:12.004 --> 11:12.922
{\an1}EMCEE:
So, you help me out

11:13.005 --> 11:14.799
right now, in welcoming
from San Francisco,

11:14.882 --> 11:17.301
California,

11:17.385 --> 11:20.304
{\an1}Diesel Stone
and the Waste Management!

11:20.388 --> 11:22.348
(cheering and applause)

11:22.431 --> 11:24.850
I don't believe it.

11:27.436 --> 11:27.895
I think she used to date

11:27.978 --> 11:29.939
the keyboard player.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.981
I haven't.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.943
Did you hear the new song?

12:16.026 --> 12:17.695
"Different Eyes"?

12:17.778 --> 12:18.988
Loved it.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.907
{\an1}I wrote that song
for you, Nikki.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.829
And having you out there
when we were doing it...

12:26.912 --> 12:28.164
was incredible.

12:28.247 --> 12:30.166
Seeing you now,

12:30.249 --> 12:31.959
I can't believe it.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.336
{\an3}So listen,

12:34.420 --> 12:37.173
we're gonna be hanging out
at this dump

12:37.256 --> 12:38.674
a little later.

12:38.757 --> 12:41.218
{\an1}It'd mean a lot if
you'd go there with me.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.012
I can't, uh, not tonight--
but if you tell me

12:43.095 --> 12:45.681
where it is, I'll
drop by tomorrow.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.016
It's only tonight, baby.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.727
{\an1}Tomorrow
it's adios, La-La Land.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.229
{\an1}Dennis...
Shh.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.190
Don't let anyone hear you
call me that.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.524
It'll ruin my image.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.860
(Nikki laughs)

12:58.903 --> 13:00.988
Come on, Nikki, please?

13:01.071 --> 13:03.532
{\an1}I can't. It's a school night.
School night?

13:03.616 --> 13:06.202
I haven't seen you
in six months.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.871
I'm here with my boyfriend.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.373
Oh.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.376
{\an3}Brandon?

13:16.295 --> 13:17.213
The Beav.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.965
{\an1}Brandon, uh, I want you
to meet Diesel Stone.

13:20.049 --> 13:23.093
{\an3}You guys were the best
band out there, man.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.513
{\an1}That's not saying
a whole hell of a lot.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.723
{\an1}Everyone else was auditioning
for amateur hour.

13:27.806 --> 13:29.725
{\an1}Did you see that
Vanilla Ice rip-off?

13:29.808 --> 13:32.061
{\an1}Couldn't even get his mike
to work. What a joke.

13:32.144 --> 13:33.938
That joke happens to be
a close friend of ours.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.316
Eh, don't take it
personally, man.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.568
{\an1}He's young-- he's
bound to get better...

13:39.652 --> 13:42.029
someday with practice...

13:42.112 --> 13:44.782
maybe.
All right, Axl.

13:44.865 --> 13:45.908
Axl Rose is a sell-out.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.494
I'll see you, Nikki.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.581
Wait a minute.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.753
That loser was
your boyfriend?

13:57.836 --> 13:59.004
He's not a loser.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.423
You don't know the music biz.
It's very competitive.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.926
{\an4}You're right, I don't.
Can we leave now?
Actually, the band's

14:04.009 --> 14:06.053
having a party
that they've invited us to.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.764
Well, we told everybody
we'd meet them at The Peach Pit.

14:08.847 --> 14:10.808
(groans):
We always go to The Peach Pit.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.561
Come on, these guys used
to be my best buddies.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.771
Nikki, don't you think
David could use the company

14:15.854 --> 14:17.815
of <i> his</i> best buddies
right about now?

14:17.898 --> 14:19.733
Fine, let's go to The Peach Pit.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.735
Hey, no one's holding
a gun to your head, Nikki.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.571
If you'd rather stay here
with Weasel

14:23.654 --> 14:26.407
{\an6}and his little bunch of
cronies, go right ahead.
His name is Diesel.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.157
I really don't give a rat's ass
what his name is!

14:27.241 --> 14:29.535
I just want to
know one thing:

14:29.618 --> 14:30.327
who are you gonna be with
tonight: him or me?

14:30.411 --> 14:33.581
He is only gonna be here
one night!

14:33.664 --> 14:35.124
{\an1}Bye, Nikki.
Brandon!

14:35.207 --> 14:36.625
{\an3}Brandon!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.919
♪ And cover up my ears ♪

14:39.003 --> 14:41.964
♪ I won't be wasting
my best years, years, years ♪

14:42.047 --> 14:44.049
♪ Years, years... ♪

14:49.054 --> 14:50.973
{\an5}BRANDON:
<i>Well, what was</i>
<i>I supposed to do, Bren?</i>

14:51.056 --> 14:53.309
I mean, clearly,
Nikki is still into this guy.

14:53.392 --> 14:54.643
I wasn't about
to hang around

14:54.727 --> 14:56.604
for the privilege
of being humiliated.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.148
Brandon, wouldn't it have been
easier to put in an appearance

14:59.231 --> 15:02.359
for 15 minutes than to make
such a big deal out of it?

15:02.443 --> 15:04.320
Yeah, but that whole rock star,

15:04.403 --> 15:06.822
"I want to be a rock star"
groupie scene,

15:06.905 --> 15:09.491
it's, it's weak.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.412
You know, Brandon, when you're
jealous, you're so judgmental.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.204
And look who's talking.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.332
Need I remind you
that last night,

15:16.415 --> 15:19.460
you couldn't bring yourself
to be within a five-mile radius

15:19.543 --> 15:21.378
{\an1}of a certain
Miss Kelly Taylor?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.339
One thing has nothing
to do with the other.

15:23.422 --> 15:26.008
{\an3}Besides, I have no desire
to spend my free time

15:26.091 --> 15:28.344
{\an3}with a lying, conniving
you-know-what.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.345
{\an1}And I'm being
judgmental.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.512
No, Brandon,

15:30.596 --> 15:32.723
you're being petty
over some guy

15:32.806 --> 15:34.725
that Nikki went out with
in another lifetime.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.811
{\an3}You're her
boyfriend, Brandon.

15:37.895 --> 15:40.314
And if you want to keep it
that way, I suggest you call her

15:40.397 --> 15:42.483
{\an3}and apologize for
walking out on her.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.194
I hate it
when you're morally superior.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.034
Hi, Mrs. Weinstein, yeah.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.703
Is, uh, is Nikki there?

15:54.787 --> 15:57.206
Oh, really?

15:57.289 --> 16:00.834
Well, I'll try her over there.
Thank you very much.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.086
Let me tell you how it is.

16:02.169 --> 16:04.421
It seems Nikki

16:04.505 --> 16:05.506
didn't come home last night.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.423
She called her aunt and told her

16:06.507 --> 16:09.093
she'd be spending the night
at Donna's.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.761
Isn't that nice?

16:12.638 --> 16:13.681
(neighing)

16:13.764 --> 16:15.391
{\an5}DYLAN:
<i>Well, if he wasn't</i>
<i>such a great jumper,</i>

16:15.474 --> 16:16.558
<i>he'd be great to rope off of.</i>

16:16.642 --> 16:18.560
How do you know about horses?

16:18.644 --> 16:21.271
Well, I used to ride some
when I was a kid.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.400
Yesterday, you acted like
you've never been on one before.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.528
So, maybe I'm not
such an easy read after all.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.408
I'm gonna take you out
for a ride after breakfast

16:32.491 --> 16:34.076
so I can get to know you better.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.995
I think I should be here
when the mechanic comes.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.207
You could ride Shadowcaster.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.252
He's my favorite horse.

16:43.335 --> 16:47.256
{\an3}He won the Oaks Classic
last month.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.092
So why do I get
special treatment?

16:50.175 --> 16:52.261
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for him.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.138
Right.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.932
(chuckles):
No. I'm serious.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.767
{\an3}Horses get bored
if they're always ridden

16:58.851 --> 17:00.436
by the same person.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.401
DAVID:
Good morning, West Beverly.

17:07.483 --> 17:08.736
Before we start off
the music today,

17:08.819 --> 17:10.237
I'd like to thank everyone
who rooted for me last night

17:10.319 --> 17:12.740
on getting a record deal.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.282
However, because of
my inept former manager,

17:14.366 --> 17:16.326
who will remain nameless--

17:16.410 --> 17:18.119
Steve Sanders,
that's S-A-N-D-E-R-S--

17:18.203 --> 17:20.955
it appears I will be
your morning DJ

17:21.039 --> 17:22.165
for the rest of my life.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.291
So long, Steve-o.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.460
Well, not too bitter.

17:24.542 --> 17:27.838
Well, at least he hasn't
lost his sense of humor.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.970
{\an3}You're the one who's lost
your sense of humor.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.806
This avoidance thing with Brenda
is really getting ridiculous.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.974
Tell it to her.

17:39.057 --> 17:41.101
{\an1}She's the one
who drove Dylan out of here.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.985
{\an3}You want
to open up?

17:50.068 --> 17:51.820
Do I know you?

17:51.904 --> 17:54.490
You don't have to embarrass me
in front of the whole school.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.575
{\an1}You ain't seen
nothing yet.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.079
(mouthing)

18:07.711 --> 18:09.505
What's the matter, Hutch?

18:09.588 --> 18:10.506
{\an1}Now that this investigation
is almost over,

18:10.589 --> 18:12.341
{\an1}you want to squeeze
one more payment out of me?

18:12.424 --> 18:14.676
You don't have enough
money to buy your way

18:14.760 --> 18:16.011
out of this one, son.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.012
Buy my way out of what?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.223
{\an1}I know for a fact
the cops don't have any clues.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.350
Yeah, but what they
do have is a janitor

18:21.433 --> 18:23.477
{\an3}with one more year on his
pension and set of keys

18:23.560 --> 18:25.312
that opens up every door
to this building.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.232
Are they accusing you
of masterminding this break-in?

18:28.315 --> 18:31.026
Son, they grilled me
for three hours yesterday

18:31.109 --> 18:33.320
over a lot more than
your piddly little break-in.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.363
Now, tomorrow,
we go another round,

18:34.446 --> 18:35.405
and I got to give them
something,

18:35.489 --> 18:36.824
and I'm afraid
it's gonna be you.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.367
Hey, you can't do that.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.326
Sorry, son, I got a lot to lose.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.370
Hey, man, I paid you!

18:41.453 --> 18:44.998
Well, money can't buy you
everything, now, can it?

18:52.631 --> 18:53.632
{\an3}Brandon!

18:53.715 --> 18:55.384
Brandon, wait!

18:55.467 --> 18:57.427
I want to talk to you
about what happened last night.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.679
{\an3}There's really not to much
to say, is there, Nikki?

18:58.762 --> 19:01.348
{\an3}You're basically a groupie,
and that's just the way it is.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.392
Is that what you think of me?

19:03.475 --> 19:05.269
{\an3}Well, tell me what
I'm supposed to think,

19:05.352 --> 19:07.604
especially after I called to
apologize to you this morning

19:07.688 --> 19:09.398
{\an3}and I find out that you
spent the night at Donna's.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.067
Will you please let me
tell you what happened.

19:12.150 --> 19:13.569
I'm listening.

19:13.652 --> 19:17.114
By the time I got to the house,

19:17.197 --> 19:18.574
{\an1}everyone was
partying hard,

19:18.657 --> 19:20.409
and I had a couple
of shots of tequila

19:20.492 --> 19:21.618
and I passed out
on the bathroom floor.

19:21.702 --> 19:25.080
Uh-huh, and was that before
or after you made it with him?

19:25.163 --> 19:28.041
Diesel is not
my boyfriend anymore.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.042
I thought you were.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.168
Yeah, I thought I was too.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.545
And all of a sudden we get
around the band last night

19:31.628 --> 19:32.629
and I become invisible.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.547
That's not true.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.924
That's exactly
what happened, Nikki.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.509
And when you finally
deemed me worthy

19:37.593 --> 19:38.594
to meet your little pal,

19:38.677 --> 19:40.220
you didn't bat an eye

19:40.304 --> 19:41.346
{\an3}when he started
dumping all over David.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.599
I told you,
musicians are very competitive.

19:43.682 --> 19:47.102
Yes, and they're also
very full of themselves.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.562
Nikki, Weasel is a loser.

19:48.645 --> 19:51.440
I don't get what
you see in him.

19:51.523 --> 19:55.319
When I get around him, he has
this thing over me, you know?

19:55.402 --> 19:58.697
No, I don't know.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.826
I just can't deal
with this right now.

20:02.910 --> 20:03.452
I'm sorry, Brandon.

20:03.535 --> 20:06.288
Yeah, me, too.

20:25.182 --> 20:25.807
Well, you were right.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.435
{\an1}The countryside's
spectacular.

20:28.518 --> 20:30.020
I wouldn't lie to you.

20:30.103 --> 20:30.646
Ha. Yeah.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.481
You would, if you had to.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.525
I happen to be the most
brutally honest person

20:35.609 --> 20:37.527
you'll ever meet.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.821
{\an1}Until the conversation
turns to you.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.406
{\an1}At which point,
you become brutally vague.

20:41.490 --> 20:46.244
So, what do you want
to know about me?

20:46.328 --> 20:48.246
What do you want to tell me?

20:50.540 --> 20:55.462
I got tossed out
of boarding school...

20:55.545 --> 20:58.382
for sleeping
with the headmaster.

20:58.465 --> 21:02.928
{\an3}My parents decided the
only way I'd survive to 19

21:03.011 --> 21:05.681
{\an3}was to marry
someone with a...

21:05.764 --> 21:06.515
{\an3}(chuckles)

21:06.598 --> 21:10.519
with a trust fund
bigger than mine.

21:10.602 --> 21:15.357
When you have real money,
it's hard to trust anybody,

21:15.440 --> 21:18.485
especially the people
you think you should love.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.914
What do you want from me, Anne?

21:35.419 --> 21:38.380
Stay with me at the ranch
for a while.

21:38.463 --> 21:41.925
You can work
Shadowcaster.

21:43.927 --> 21:45.929
{\an3}I'll pay you whatever
you think's fair.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.853
I'm tempted.

21:52.936 --> 21:55.897
No pressure,

21:55.981 --> 21:58.483
no strings, for either of us.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.631
{\an5}NIKKI:
I'm sorry I didn't join you guys
at the Peach Pit last night.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.633
It's just that I hadn't
seen Diesel and the band

22:23.717 --> 22:25.427
since I left San Francisco.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.637
Was David really bummed?

22:27.721 --> 22:28.555
More like suicidal.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.266
{\an3}I'm sorry I
didn't make it.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.268
I really planned
to be there for him.

22:33.351 --> 22:34.936
It's okay.
I understand.

22:35.020 --> 22:35.979
And I'm sure David does too.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.523
Too bad Brandon's not as
understanding as you are.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.112
Diesel, what are
you doing here?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.448
Is that any way to greet
the next Eddie Van Halen?

22:46.531 --> 22:47.532
What are you talking about?

22:47.616 --> 22:49.618
We clinched it, babe!

22:49.701 --> 22:52.120
Waste Management got itself
a record deal.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.164
Diesel, that's great!

22:54.247 --> 22:56.583
Diesel, um, this is Donna.

22:56.666 --> 22:57.667
{\an3}She was at the showcase
last night.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.628
How ya doin'?

22:59.711 --> 23:01.671
Congratulations.

23:01.755 --> 23:05.425
So, there's a celebration
going on.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.345
{\an3}I need my sweet little
inspiration right by my side.

23:08.428 --> 23:10.597
{\an3}Um, I can't. I've got
a history test fifth period.

23:10.680 --> 23:12.641
Maybe you didn't hear me,

23:12.724 --> 23:16.311
but I drove straight here after
signing on the dotted line.

23:16.394 --> 23:17.604
I'll tell you what.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.523
{\an3}I'll come by
right after school.

23:19.606 --> 23:22.359
{\an1}And if I know you, the party
will still be happening.

23:22.442 --> 23:23.485
Will you excuse us a sec?

23:23.568 --> 23:24.111
Sure.

23:25.695 --> 23:26.655
Baby, what's wrong with you?

23:26.738 --> 23:29.032
I finally get my big break

23:29.116 --> 23:29.825
{\an1}and you're, like, talking
about history tests?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.910
I am, but...
Well, then come on.

23:31.993 --> 23:33.370
Get in the car.
Dennis, please.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.079
Come on!
Hey, hey!

23:34.162 --> 23:34.663
Is everything all right here?

23:34.746 --> 23:36.623
Get lost, chump.

23:36.706 --> 23:37.666
Am I talking to you, son?

23:37.749 --> 23:40.001
Well, I'm talking to you!
Disappear!

23:40.085 --> 23:41.795
Is everything all right, Nikki?

23:41.878 --> 23:43.672
I'm fine, Brandon.

23:43.755 --> 23:44.673
You sure?

23:44.756 --> 23:46.466
I said I'm okay.

23:46.550 --> 23:47.467
I can handle this.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.136
{\an3}Just please
stay out of it.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.012
Fine. I'm out of it.

23:51.096 --> 23:51.638
Stay out of it, Brandy.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.101
You left me for that geek?

23:56.184 --> 23:58.270
{\an1}You know why
I left you. Don't...

23:58.353 --> 23:59.688
Just get in the car.

23:59.771 --> 24:00.522
{\an1}You've been drinking
all morning, haven't you?

24:00.605 --> 24:04.401
Just get in the car, Nikki! Man!

24:07.779 --> 24:10.782
(tires squealing)

24:21.751 --> 24:25.213
Yeah, yeah,
what a senior year, huh?

24:25.297 --> 24:28.049
{\an3}Scorned by our lovers,
abandoned by our best friends.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.385
It's a regular Elizabethan
tragedy around this place.

24:30.468 --> 24:31.553
What is going on, Brandon?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.889
{\an1}I mean, it's like everybody
has something to hide.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.223
{\an1}I don't know
who to trust anymore.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.725
{\an1}I thought I had
everything with Dylan.

24:36.808 --> 24:37.809
{\an5}I don't even
know where he is.
Wait a minute.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.228
{\an3}I thought we were talking
about my problem here.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.230
{\an6}Sorry.
Right, like
I was saying,

24:42.314 --> 24:43.732
{\an3}I give Nikki the
benefit of the doubt,

24:43.815 --> 24:44.733
{\an3}now she's going around acting
like I'm the bad guy.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.402
{\an1}Brandon, do you think
that she was lying to you

24:47.485 --> 24:48.570
{\an5}about passing out from
too much tequila last night?
I don't know, Bren,

24:48.653 --> 24:52.115
{\an3}and at this point and time,
I really don't care.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.075
You know, at least
we have each other.

24:54.159 --> 24:54.743
{\an3}That we do,
little sister.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.245
{\an3}That we do.
Chin, chin.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.622
Oh, chow, chow.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.040
{\an1}Hi, Bren.

25:00.123 --> 25:01.208
Hi, Donna.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.251
Why, hello, Kelly.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.169
Hey, Bren.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.255
Donna, we're gonna be late
for art class.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.924
Don't let me hold you up.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.259
{\an3}Bye, Donna.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.803
{\an3}You know, this is
really getting obnoxious.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.430
Yeah, it is.

25:27.525 --> 25:28.151
How'd you like
Shadowcaster?

25:28.235 --> 25:30.737
He rides better
than this car.

25:30.820 --> 25:31.780
He's worth more
than this car.

25:31.863 --> 25:34.741
{\an1}I don't know about that man.
This thing's a classic.

25:34.824 --> 25:37.911
{\an3}The horse you were on:
priceless.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.792
{\an3}You told me you were
a top-flight mechanic.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.711
{\an3}You've been working
on this car for hours.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.881
Well, I'm very thorough.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.801
{\an3}Uh-huh. I have some neighbors
coming over for dinner.

25:52.884 --> 25:53.802
I want you to join us.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.428
Are you sure?

25:55.512 --> 25:56.805
{\an3}Yeah, I had Raymond
put out a shirt for you.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.475
This isn't the proper fashion
statement for your neighbors?

26:00.558 --> 26:01.810
Suit yourself.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.813
Anne.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.607
I'll wear whatever you want.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.858
No big deal.

26:14.698 --> 26:17.200
Herby, I was just
thinking about you.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.369
Yeah, what's going on?

26:19.452 --> 26:21.830
Well, it seems we have ourselves
a little situation.

26:21.913 --> 26:25.625
Situation?

26:26.584 --> 26:27.335
HERBERT:
<i>You want me to what?</i>

26:27.419 --> 26:29.838
{\an3}Yeah, I know this
sounds insane,

26:29.921 --> 26:30.839
{\an3}but let me put this
in perspective, okay?

26:30.922 --> 26:34.509
Look, I'm a senior.
You are a freshman.

26:34.592 --> 26:37.470
If you take the rap for me,

26:37.554 --> 26:39.514
{\an3}they'll figure
you're immature,

26:39.597 --> 26:40.056
you're misguided.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.891
You are rehabilitatible.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.519
But me, I'm a senior.

26:44.602 --> 26:47.689
If I get busted,
I get expelled.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.816
{\an3}Boom, my life
is over.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.818
So, you... you want me
to be the fall guy.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.778
Is that it?

26:53.862 --> 26:55.572
Look...

26:55.655 --> 26:56.698
I know this break-in thing

26:56.781 --> 26:58.825
didn't go exactly
as we had planned.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.202
I'm not blaming anybody
for that.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.912
These things happen.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.706
But you know I wouldn't
ask you to help me out

27:04.789 --> 27:07.751
of this mess unless it was
really, really important to me.

27:07.834 --> 27:12.714
Herbert, if you do this,
I'll be eternally grateful.

27:12.797 --> 27:17.552
You know,
during my freshman orientation,

27:17.635 --> 27:21.556
when I signed up
for a senior buddy...

27:21.639 --> 27:22.891
I could've never imagined
I'd be paired up

27:22.974 --> 27:25.727
with as disgusting
a human being as you are.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.771
{\an1}You're a cheater,
a liar, a screw-up...

27:27.854 --> 27:30.231
and you're so conceited,

27:30.315 --> 27:32.192
you think you can buy your way
out of anything or use anyone,

27:32.275 --> 27:33.902
{\an1}as long as it's good
for Steve Sanders.

27:33.985 --> 27:37.030
And the truth is...

27:37.113 --> 27:39.783
I don't know how you
can stand being you.

27:52.796 --> 27:54.547
I'll tell you what you have
to do with people like that.

27:54.631 --> 27:58.593
{\an1}Somebody's gotta tell them,
it's work or no pay,

27:58.676 --> 27:59.552
and if they don't like it,

27:59.636 --> 28:01.596
{\an1}they can go back
where they came from.

28:01.679 --> 28:04.974
I prefer your idea of
indentured servitude.

28:05.058 --> 28:06.267
Would you two stop?

28:06.351 --> 28:08.770
Dylan and I are
getting bored.

28:08.853 --> 28:10.855
{\an1}Are you sure you
don't want a taste?

28:10.939 --> 28:14.943
'85 was a very good year.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.487
{\an3}Dylan was probably
in Little League

28:17.570 --> 28:19.239
{\an1}in '85.

28:19.322 --> 28:21.783
{\an3}Actually, Dylan was
stealing cars in '85.

28:21.866 --> 28:22.951
A self-made man.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.286
How unusual.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.539
{\an1}Oh, believe me,
Dylan is very unusual.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.291
{\an1}I think that horse of yours
is very unusual.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.168
{\an1}I told you
Shadowcaster is not for sale.

28:32.252 --> 28:34.629
Not even for $600,000?

28:34.712 --> 28:37.424
Keenan, the last thing we need
is another show jumper.

28:37.507 --> 28:38.800
That is beside the point.

28:38.883 --> 28:43.430
I like that horse.

28:43.513 --> 28:44.639
Too bad, 'cause I'm never
going to sell him.

28:44.722 --> 28:46.850
Never is such
a finite term.

28:46.933 --> 28:47.851
{\an1}$700,000.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.854
What should I do, Dylan?

28:50.937 --> 28:53.022
How much do you think
Shadowcaster is worth?

28:53.106 --> 28:55.942
You've ridden him.

28:56.025 --> 28:56.943
I thought he
wasn't for sale.

28:57.026 --> 29:00.155
Everything is for sale, kid.

29:01.281 --> 29:04.075
One million dollars, cash.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.618
{\an1}It's take it
or leave it time.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.328
Don't do it, Anne.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.163
One million four.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.832
{\an5}Million two.
Anne!
Million three.

29:10.915 --> 29:11.416
Done.

29:13.585 --> 29:14.961
Congratulations, Keenan.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.589
{\an3}You just bought
yourself a champ.

29:20.758 --> 29:22.927
Everything is for sale, kid.

29:27.432 --> 29:28.975
Here you go, Bren.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.018
(phone ringing)

29:30.101 --> 29:33.188
Why is it customers always
call us on the pay phone?

29:33.271 --> 29:36.107
{\an3}I'll get back to you
on that one...

29:36.191 --> 29:37.192
{\an5}Hi, Donna.
!
Hi, Kel.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.026
Where is everybody?

29:38.109 --> 29:40.028
Uh, Brandon went
to answer the phone,

29:40.111 --> 29:42.238
and David's in
the little boy's room.

29:42.322 --> 29:45.200
Oh, and you do remember
Brenda Walsh here.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.368
{\an1}Remember she used
to be your best friend?

29:47.452 --> 29:48.953
Well, we all have
our crosses to bear.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.788
Or our legs to uncross.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.081
See ya later.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.042
{\an3}Hold it!

29:54.125 --> 29:56.211
You know, I've had it up to here
with both of you!

29:56.294 --> 29:58.338
You're my best friends and
you're making my life miserable,

29:58.421 --> 29:59.589
and I'm sick and tired of it.

29:59.672 --> 30:01.049
Donna, are you finished?

30:01.132 --> 30:04.552
No, Bren, I'm not finished!

30:04.636 --> 30:06.054
{\an3}And you're the one who
started this whole thing.

30:06.137 --> 30:07.430
What do you mean, I started it?

30:07.514 --> 30:09.724
Well, you said you wanted
to see other people.

30:09.807 --> 30:11.059
So then when Dylan did,
you suddenly decided

30:11.142 --> 30:12.519
"other people"
didn't include Kelly.

30:12.602 --> 30:13.228
Thank you, Donna.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.356
Get off your high horse, Kelly.

30:16.439 --> 30:18.566
You know, I think that was
incredibly insensitive

30:18.650 --> 30:19.901
to go out with Dylan
without even discussing it

30:19.984 --> 30:21.152
with Brenda first.

30:21.236 --> 30:23.029
{\an1}How did you
expect her to feel?

30:24.155 --> 30:25.782
You know, if the two of you
don't stop fighting,

30:25.865 --> 30:26.699
you're gonna lose something

30:26.783 --> 30:27.742
that's a whole lot
more important

30:27.825 --> 30:28.993
than some guy
who walked out on everybody.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.081
Now, I'm finished.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.082
Are you finished?

30:34.165 --> 30:35.708
Yeah.

30:35.792 --> 30:36.042
Good. Let's go.

30:43.174 --> 30:46.261
Brandon, what's the matter?

30:46.344 --> 30:49.097
That was Nikki's aunt
on the phone.

30:49.180 --> 30:51.057
She was checking to see
if she's here.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.225
I guess she didn't come home
from school today.

30:52.308 --> 30:54.936
Her parents have been trying
to get in touch with her,

30:55.019 --> 30:55.603
warn her that Diesel's in town.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.272
What do you mean, "warn her?"

30:57.355 --> 30:59.607
It seems Diesel has a slight
problem with women.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.984
Occasionally, he likes
to beat them up.

31:11.202 --> 31:12.120
Oh, righteous song.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.956
Is that done by
anyone we know?

31:15.039 --> 31:16.082
Where have you been?

31:16.165 --> 31:18.126
{\an3}I told you I was going out
to get a pack of smokes.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.794
That was over two hours ago.

31:19.877 --> 31:22.589
Yeah, where are Blade
and the boys?

31:22.672 --> 31:24.507
They went to get
something to eat.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.759
{\an3}Well, you should've gone
with them, baby.

31:26.843 --> 31:27.969
I wasn't hungry.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.138
Oh, where are my manners?

31:30.221 --> 31:31.306
Amy, this is Nikki.

31:31.389 --> 31:34.434
{\an1}She's the girl who inspired me
to write "Different Eyes."

31:34.517 --> 31:35.393
Dennis, um...

31:36.060 --> 31:38.813
Can I talk to you
a minute alone, please?

31:38.896 --> 31:41.899
(whispering):
I'll be there in a minute.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.112
What's going on?

31:46.195 --> 31:47.947
Who is this Amy?

31:48.031 --> 31:51.034
{\an1}What the hell difference
does it make?

31:51.117 --> 31:52.994
{\an1}Listen, you know how
I feel about you, Nikki.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.495
I'm crazy about you,

31:54.579 --> 31:55.204
{\an1}but when you get
on this possessive trip,

31:55.288 --> 31:59.000
I don't know how
to deal with it.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.127
Then don't deal with it.

32:01.210 --> 32:03.129
W-wait, where do you
think you're going?

32:03.212 --> 32:04.464
{\an3}Come here.

32:04.547 --> 32:07.592
{\an3}You can't expect a guy like me
to be faithful to one woman.

32:07.675 --> 32:09.552
You're hurting me.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.179
It's the best day of my life,
and you're gonna bring me down?

32:11.262 --> 32:13.473
Let go of me, Dennis.

32:13.556 --> 32:16.142
I told you not to call me that,
didn't I?

32:16.225 --> 32:17.226
Stop it! Just let go of me!

32:39.248 --> 32:41.125
(knocking)

32:41.209 --> 32:43.544
Yeah?

32:43.628 --> 32:44.253
I want to talk to Nikki.

32:44.337 --> 32:45.213
{\an4}Get lost, Jack.
NIKKI:
Brandon.

32:45.296 --> 32:47.423
{\an1}Brandon!

32:51.969 --> 32:52.762
You okay?

32:52.845 --> 32:53.304
{\an3}Listen, this is
between me and her.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.682
Please take me home.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.057
{\an3}You're not going
anywhere.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.102
Yes, I am.

32:59.185 --> 33:00.103
Nikki!
Hey, you heard her.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.938
She's leaving.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.189
Fine, take her.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.066
You two make a real cute couple.

33:05.149 --> 33:06.401
{\an3}But you better
be careful.

33:06.484 --> 33:09.779
{\an3}She's jailbait,
you know.

33:09.862 --> 33:12.031
{\an1}Did you ever slap
any guys around, Weasel,

33:12.115 --> 33:13.866
or is beating up young
girls more your style?

33:13.950 --> 33:15.868
You wanna take me on?

33:15.952 --> 33:17.245
{\an1}Well, I ain't got nothing
to prove, but, uh,

33:17.328 --> 33:21.916
if you wanna take a shot,
why don't you go ahead, Dennis?

33:25.002 --> 33:26.170
{\an1}Brandon!

33:29.215 --> 33:32.301
Let's get out of here.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.944
{\an6}BRANDON:
You sure ice is all
you want on that?

33:50.027 --> 33:51.612
I can't get you
anything else?

33:52.655 --> 33:55.867
No, I'm fine.

33:55.950 --> 33:59.620
{\an1}Well, um...
actually, I'm not fine,

33:59.704 --> 34:03.833
{\an1}but, uh, I'm better off
than I was 40 minutes ago.

34:03.916 --> 34:07.003
How's your hand?

34:07.086 --> 34:09.589
It's a little tender.

34:09.672 --> 34:10.672
{\an1}Um...

34:11.674 --> 34:14.260
Listen, Brandon...

34:14.342 --> 34:17.679
{\an3}Y-You don't have to explain
anything to me, really.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.724
I want to. Um...

34:23.060 --> 34:26.647
{\an1}I never told this
to you before, but...

34:26.731 --> 34:29.442
Diesel was the main reason
why I left San Francisco.

34:29.525 --> 34:30.275
I thought it was because
you weren't getting along

34:30.359 --> 34:32.320
with your parents.

34:32.402 --> 34:34.447
{\an1}He was the reason
why we weren't getting along.

34:34.530 --> 34:36.491
Well, I can see why.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.492
{\an1}No.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.952
No, he's really a great guy.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.289
When he's into his music
and he's not drinking,

34:43.371 --> 34:46.542
he can be the...

34:48.585 --> 34:50.463
There I go again...

34:50.545 --> 34:52.297
making excuses for him.

34:52.380 --> 34:55.134
{\an5}(sobbing):
He hits me
and I make excuses for him.

34:55.217 --> 35:00.848
I don't want to seem naive
or anything, but, uh...

35:00.932 --> 35:03.601
why would you want to hang
around with a guy like that?

35:05.686 --> 35:08.523
Because I never thought
I deserved any better.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.692
Because until I met you,

35:11.776 --> 35:14.320
{\an1}I never knew what a good
relationship could be.

35:14.403 --> 35:15.321
You're kidding, right?

35:15.404 --> 35:16.531
No.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.783
{\an3}I thought I
could change him.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.370
Is there anything

35:22.453 --> 35:24.539
{\an1}I can do?

35:24.622 --> 35:26.374
{\an1}No... I'm fine.
Thank you.

35:26.457 --> 35:29.544
{\an1}Um, my aunt should be here
any minute.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.046
Oh, there's no rush.

35:32.129 --> 35:34.340
You're welcome to stay
as long as you want to.

35:34.423 --> 35:37.885
{\an1}Thank you.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.224
Your mom is real sweet.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.476
Yeah, well, we've
trained her well.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.355
{\an1}Being here makes me
really miss my family.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.066
Are things really so bad

35:52.149 --> 35:53.568
{\an3}that you can't even
talk to them anymore?

35:53.651 --> 35:56.779
Actually, I'm supposed to be
going home for Thanksgiving.

35:57.822 --> 36:02.076
{\an3}Well, look, that's
next week...

36:02.159 --> 36:05.371
and, uh...

36:05.454 --> 36:08.791
when you get back...

36:08.875 --> 36:09.250
I'll still be here.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.044
Really?

36:12.128 --> 36:14.213
Yeah.

36:17.508 --> 36:20.219
(doorbell rings)

36:20.303 --> 36:21.304
{\an3}Must be
Nikki's aunt.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.933
{\an3}Hi, Mrs. Walsh,
Mr. Walsh.

36:26.017 --> 36:26.934
Kelly.

36:27.018 --> 36:27.977
{\an1}It's good
to see you.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.186
Come on in.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.106
{\an3}Do you think it'll
be okay with Brenda?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.192
{\an1}Well, there's only one way
to find out.

36:38.571 --> 36:40.364
(walking upstairs)

36:42.366 --> 36:43.284
{\an1}(knocking)

36:43.367 --> 36:43.576
Hold on a sec.

36:43.659 --> 36:44.493
{\an3}Come in.

36:48.664 --> 36:50.499
Hi.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.460
Never mind, David.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.128
You don't need
to leave her a message.

36:54.211 --> 36:55.463
{\an3}Bye.

36:55.546 --> 36:56.464
You were just calling me?

36:56.547 --> 36:59.634
Yeah.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.970
Bren, I'm sorry...
I'm sorry, Kelly.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.472
I said some terrible...

37:05.765 --> 37:08.726
Let's start over.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.022
Look, Donna was right.

37:13.105 --> 37:16.442
It was my decision
to break up with Dylan.

37:16.525 --> 37:18.486
It was just a shock
seeing you two together,

37:18.569 --> 37:19.654
{\an3}but it wasn't
your fault.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.531
No, it, it <i> was</i> my fault.

37:22.615 --> 37:25.034
What Donna said is true.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.495
{\an1}It was really
inconsiderate of me

37:27.578 --> 37:30.164
{\an1}not to talk to you
about it first.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.500
(sighs)

37:32.583 --> 37:33.501
We used to talk
about everything.

37:33.584 --> 37:37.672
Yeah, and we let a guy
come in between us.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.508
{\an3}(laughs)

37:40.591 --> 37:43.678
It's so '50s.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.014
I missed you.

37:47.098 --> 37:50.309
I missed you, too.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.185
Poor Donna.

37:51.268 --> 37:53.354
{\an3}We really put her
through the wringer.

37:53.437 --> 37:54.355
(laughs)

37:54.438 --> 37:56.649
Yeah.

37:56.732 --> 38:01.070
{\an3}Look, Kelly... I have
to ask you something...

38:01.153 --> 38:04.323
{\an3}not because I'm accusing
you of anything,

38:04.407 --> 38:06.450
{\an3}but, uh, you haven't heard
from him, have you?

38:08.452 --> 38:09.370
No.

38:09.453 --> 38:11.789
Have you?

38:16.585 --> 38:20.548
You taking that bag
on our morning ride?

38:20.631 --> 38:25.177
{\an3}I think it's time
I hit the road, Anne.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.220
{\an1}I figured
something was up

38:26.303 --> 38:28.389
{\an1}when you disappeared
last night.

38:28.472 --> 38:29.557
{\an3}How could you sell
Shadowcaster?

38:29.640 --> 38:33.394
{\an3}I thought you loved
that horse.

38:33.477 --> 38:37.898
{\an1}Dylan, it's a game...
and I won.

38:37.982 --> 38:38.899
It's not a game.

38:38.983 --> 38:39.900
You didn't win anything.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.068
Look around you, Anne.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.945
The last thing you
need is more money.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.573
Oh, you're going to teach me
about the ways of the world?

38:45.656 --> 38:47.575
{\an1}When you have money, Dylan,
nothing is irreplaceable.

38:47.658 --> 38:49.410
(scoffs)

38:49.493 --> 38:50.578
Thanks for putting me up.

38:50.661 --> 38:51.537
So that's it?

38:51.620 --> 38:52.580
{\an1}Wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.582
{\an5}All because I sold
a horse?
No.

38:54.665 --> 38:55.583
It's because I had a flash

38:55.666 --> 38:58.544
of what my life could be
like 20 years from now.

38:58.627 --> 38:59.920
I don't want to
end up like you.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.047
{\an1}What is that supposed
to mean?

39:01.130 --> 39:04.550
{\an3}It means I didn't steal
the car, Anne. It's mine.

39:04.633 --> 39:06.635
{\an3}When I turn 21, I'll
come into a trust fund

39:06.719 --> 39:08.888
{\an3}worth hundreds of millions
of dollars, just like you did.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.639
{\an1}Am I supposed
to believe you?

39:10.723 --> 39:12.475
You can believe anything
you want, but I left L.A.

39:12.558 --> 39:15.311
because there was too much
pressure, too many people,

39:15.394 --> 39:17.605
{\an3}too many strings pulling me
all these different ways,

39:17.688 --> 39:19.148
and you know
what I realized?

39:19.231 --> 39:20.441
Without the strings,

39:20.524 --> 39:21.901
{\an3}you're not tied
to anything.

39:21.984 --> 39:24.653
{\an3}You might as well
be dead inside.

39:27.531 --> 39:29.784
Take care of yourself, Anne.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.262
(horse neighing)

39:56.685 --> 39:58.604
(school bell rings)

39:58.687 --> 40:00.689
{\an3}You know, Donna, if
this art school thing

40:00.773 --> 40:02.108
doesn't work
out for you,

40:02.191 --> 40:03.776
maybe you should consider
being a group therapist.

40:03.859 --> 40:05.653
I'm just glad you two are
on speaking terms again.

40:05.736 --> 40:07.530
Me, too.
I'm afraid

40:07.613 --> 40:09.615
this little lovefest
is about to end.

40:09.698 --> 40:12.618
David, I've got
some great news.

40:12.701 --> 40:15.454
Listen, Steve,
give it up, all right?

40:15.538 --> 40:15.830
You're not my manager.

40:15.913 --> 40:18.165
Case closed.

40:21.293 --> 40:22.002
What's this?

40:22.086 --> 40:24.046
{\an3}It's a list of the
top ten managers

40:24.130 --> 40:25.464
{\an3}in the music
business,

40:25.548 --> 40:27.341
who are probably flipping
out over your demo tapes

40:27.424 --> 40:28.676
that I had messengered
to them this morning.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.512
So if a Bernie
or a Marty call you

40:31.595 --> 40:34.515
and tell you they want
to represent you, it's legit.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.017
You have real
talent, David.

40:37.101 --> 40:39.520
You deserve the best.

40:39.603 --> 40:40.646
{\an1}Thanks.
Yeah,

40:40.729 --> 40:42.648
{\an3}and how much do you get
for a finder's fee, Steve?

40:42.731 --> 40:44.525
Is that how you think of me,
Kelly?

40:44.608 --> 40:47.653
{\an3}That all I care about is what
I'm going to get out of it?

40:47.736 --> 40:49.864
Well, it's part
of your charm.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.407
Kelly, remember when I said

40:51.490 --> 40:54.285
I never told Lenny Horowitz
how sexy you were in bed?

40:55.286 --> 40:58.205
{\an3}I did.

40:58.289 --> 41:02.001
I did because I thought it would
make me sound like a stud.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.502
I'm sorry.

41:03.586 --> 41:04.712
You're a very special
person to me, Kelly.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.798
I hope you can find it in your
heart to someday forgive me.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.177
Excuse me.

41:11.260 --> 41:12.261
{\an3}Brandon.

41:14.638 --> 41:18.058
Brandon, I want to
show you something

41:18.142 --> 41:21.645
{\an3}and if you never talk to me
again, I'll understand.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.401
Is this what I think it is?

41:27.484 --> 41:27.985
{\an3}Yeah.

41:28.694 --> 41:33.282
A real live legacy key.

41:33.365 --> 41:35.451
{\an3}I thought it would
be so simple.

41:35.534 --> 41:37.244
{\an3}No one would know.
No one would get hurt.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.579
{\an3}In my own twisted
little brain,

41:38.662 --> 41:41.040
{\an3}I actually thought I was doing
something for a good cause:

41:41.123 --> 41:45.586
to get into a great school.

41:45.669 --> 41:48.088
{\an3}I screwed up royally
this time.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.757
I lied.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.842
I lied to you, man.

41:53.844 --> 41:57.264
{\an3}I stepped so far
over the line,

41:57.348 --> 41:58.599
I don't know if I can
ever find my way back.

41:58.682 --> 42:02.353
{\an3}I'm gonna go find Ms. Teasley
and cop to the whole thing.

42:02.436 --> 42:04.063
What do you think
is going to happen?

42:04.146 --> 42:04.855
I don't know
what's going to happen,

42:04.939 --> 42:06.815
{\an3}but if I don't
have any friends,

42:06.899 --> 42:09.276
what the hell does
it matter, right?

42:09.360 --> 42:09.777
I think you underrate us, Steve.

42:09.860 --> 42:10.778
{\an3}No,

42:10.861 --> 42:13.656
I never underrated you, Brandon,

42:13.739 --> 42:17.451
but you... you all...

42:17.534 --> 42:19.328
overrated me.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.622
Now, if you'll excuse me,

42:21.705 --> 42:23.749
I think there's a story <i> The</i>
<i>Blaze</i> might be interested in.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.794
ANDREA:
<i>So, wait a minute.</i>

42:26.877 --> 42:28.796
{\an3}you're telling me
that this was all a scam?

42:28.879 --> 42:32.424
{\an3}You were being nice to me
just to keep me off the trail?

42:32.508 --> 42:33.717
{\an1}Andrea, of all the lowest,
dirtiest things

42:33.801 --> 42:36.720
{\an1}I've ever done
in my life,

42:36.804 --> 42:39.473
breaking into the school
is definitely the worst.

42:39.556 --> 42:42.393
But I've never needed a reason
to be nice to you.

42:44.853 --> 42:47.481
{\an3}This is a very
serious matter, Steve.

42:47.564 --> 42:49.817
{\an3}What you've done
is against the law.

42:49.900 --> 42:50.985
{\an1}I know.

42:51.068 --> 42:54.655
And personally, I'm very,
very disappointed in you.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.783
{\an1}That makes two of us,
Mrs. Teasley.

42:57.866 --> 42:58.784
{\an6}Don't make
light of this.
I'm not.

42:58.867 --> 43:01.495
{\an5}I just don't know
what else to say.
Oh,

43:01.578 --> 43:03.580
I think there's a lot more
for you to say.

43:03.664 --> 43:04.456
You mean to the police?

43:04.540 --> 43:07.001
We'll get around to that,
but first

43:07.084 --> 43:09.712
I have an interrogation
of my own I'd like to do.

43:09.795 --> 43:12.631
You know, Steve,

43:12.715 --> 43:16.468
you don't know a megabyte
from a megaburger,

43:16.552 --> 43:17.511
which would seem to indicate

43:17.594 --> 43:20.472
someone helped you break
into that computer system.

43:21.557 --> 43:23.684
Talk to me, Steve.

43:23.767 --> 43:25.311
{\an3}You're in very
serious trouble.

43:25.394 --> 43:27.354
{\an3}Now, either you tell me
the name of your accomplice

43:27.438 --> 43:28.355
or I'm going
to be forced

43:28.439 --> 43:30.858
to recommend expulsion
rather than suspension.

43:30.941 --> 43:35.362
It could be the difference
between graduating on time

43:35.446 --> 43:36.905
or not graduating at all.

43:38.907 --> 43:41.702
It was...

43:43.120 --> 43:45.664
It was a solo operation.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.792
I did it all by myself.

43:51.295 --> 43:54.214
Then I'm sorry to say that
as of today, you are no longer

43:54.298 --> 43:56.967
{\an3}a student at
West Beverly High.
