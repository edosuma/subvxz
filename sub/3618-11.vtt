WEBVTT

00:07.120 --> 00:08.951
Come on, let's go skiing.

00:09.206 --> 00:11.197
I want to, but...

00:11.458 --> 00:14.495
But what?
What's holding you back?

00:14.795 --> 00:16.274
<i>Mama, Mama.</i>

00:16.505 --> 00:18.143
Wyatt?

00:20.299 --> 00:24.895
He must be pretty special
for you to give up everything.

00:27.391 --> 00:30.030
<i>Mama. Mama. Mama.</i>

00:33.231 --> 00:35.267
<i>- Mama.
- Wyatt.</i>

00:40.572 --> 00:41.800
Wyatt.

00:48.453 --> 00:50.205
- Mama.
- Okay.

00:51.208 --> 00:55.201
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:12.563 --> 01:16.397
At last we have found him.

03:12.689 --> 03:15.044
Okay, I think she's upstairs.

03:15.316 --> 03:17.910
- I just got a neck spasm.
- Don't drop the bags, she'll hear you.

03:18.195 --> 03:20.663
- Thanks for your concern.
- You okay?

03:20.946 --> 03:23.460
Yeah, just sometimes it flares up
under stress.

03:23.742 --> 03:26.575
Yeah, and you got enough stress
in your life, that's for damn sure.

03:26.870 --> 03:30.021
With what you guys do, I'm surprised
it doesn't flare up all the time.

03:30.374 --> 03:32.046
It's not demons,
it's this birthday stuff.

03:32.334 --> 03:35.849
Especially Piper's.
I always screw up the surprise.

03:36.214 --> 03:38.967
- I'll take these to the kitchen.
- Oh, thanks.

03:39.926 --> 03:41.598
Plus, I have no idea
what I'm gonna get her,

03:41.846 --> 03:43.518
and, obviously, time is running out.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.640
Paige, I told you you could come in on
the dinner with me. I don't mind.

03:46.974 --> 03:49.442
I appreciate that, but I don't want to
jump on your bandwagon.

03:49.728 --> 03:51.480
I wanna do my own thing.

03:51.771 --> 03:54.160
Well, being a mom, I can tell you
that a nice, normal dinner

03:54.441 --> 03:56.397
with friends and family
is a perfect gift.

03:56.693 --> 03:58.968
Especially since you guys
don't live here anymore.

03:59.238 --> 04:03.117
No, the perfect gift actually
doesn't exist anymore.

04:04.243 --> 04:07.121
- Do tell.
- Hey, do these go?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.132
- Oh, no, grab those two.
- Okay.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.930
It's a charm bracelet
that mom gave Piper.

04:12.209 --> 04:14.200
And Piper loved it,
but then Prue lost it.

04:14.461 --> 04:16.372
- Why don't we cast a...?
- A lost-and-found spell?

04:16.630 --> 04:17.949
I tried. It didn't work.

04:18.882 --> 04:20.952
Is Jason coming to the party?

04:21.260 --> 04:24.969
No, he's in some faraway land,
like Zimbabwe or something.

04:25.349 --> 04:28.147
That must be fun, you guys travelling
all around the world together.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.630
Yeah, it's... It's nice.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.409
I just... I really miss home.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.001
I'm happy to be here right now.

04:34.233 --> 04:36.110
What about your beau,
is he coming?

04:36.359 --> 04:40.477
Richard? No. He's kind of got
a bit of a problem with magic.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.016
Or it has a problem with him.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.399
- He doesn't like it?
- No, magic just doesn't like him.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.454
It's a long story.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.499
- So it's just us then?
- What about Leo?

04:50.792 --> 04:53.465
Yeah, we kind of thought that
that was inappropriate.

04:56.214 --> 04:58.409
- That's her. Out, out. Hurry.
- We'll see you tomorrow.

04:58.675 --> 05:00.074
Okay.

05:01.804 --> 05:03.601
Go! Paige, the groceries.

05:06.766 --> 05:08.165
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:08.393 --> 05:10.748
How's that surprise party going?

05:19.447 --> 05:21.642
What do you...? What do you mean,
surprise party?

05:21.949 --> 05:23.098
There's no surprise party.

05:23.326 --> 05:25.362
Just do me a favour
and don't invite Greg.

05:25.620 --> 05:28.373
Or any other guys, for that matter,
because I'm done with them.

05:28.664 --> 05:32.100
- I'm sorry?
- It's kind of an epiphany I had.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.979
Right after I vanquished a demon
in Wyatt's room.

05:35.296 --> 05:36.729
Wait, excuse me?

05:37.299 --> 05:40.097
- You know, an epiphany, a revelation.
- No, I know about the epiphany.

05:40.385 --> 05:41.579
What do you mean, a demon?

05:41.845 --> 05:44.996
- Okay, why didn't you call us?
- Well, I didn't wanna bother you.

05:45.308 --> 05:47.026
It's no big deal.
I blew him up, he's gone.

05:47.435 --> 05:50.029
You know every time you say that
they come back with a vengeance.

05:50.355 --> 05:52.186
- Kiss of death.
- It doesn't matter,

05:52.482 --> 05:53.756
because I'm on it full-time now.

05:53.982 --> 05:57.611
I'm actually thinking of selling the club
because I have a new mission in life.

05:57.945 --> 05:59.936
And it's all become very clear to me.

06:00.197 --> 06:01.391
Would you care to elaborate?

06:03.910 --> 06:06.060
Do you guys know that Wyatt
called me "Mama"?

06:06.621 --> 06:11.092
- He did? Oh, his first word.
- Right after he was attacked.

06:11.459 --> 06:14.337
I don't think I'm gonna be putting that
in his baby book.

06:16.049 --> 06:17.448
Back to giving up guys...

06:18.259 --> 06:19.738
It's kind of freeing, actually.

06:19.967 --> 06:21.719
You know, not having to play
the dating game.

06:21.970 --> 06:24.438
It was just a big waste of time
for me, anyway.

06:24.722 --> 06:29.079
I mean, I gave it my best shot, I did,
but it just didn't work out for me.

06:29.436 --> 06:33.190
Okay, that is completely ridiculous.
You've been single for six months.

06:33.524 --> 06:37.312
No, that's fate.
It's my fate, and I accept it.

06:37.653 --> 06:41.851
Apparently, you get one soul mate
in a lifetime, so I guess Leo was mine.

06:42.534 --> 06:46.527
And now I'm ready to devote my life
to protecting and raising Wyatt.

06:47.579 --> 06:48.932
What about sex?

06:49.206 --> 06:51.436
Well, you know, I'm the mother,

06:51.709 --> 06:53.745
of one of the most magical
creatures ever.

06:54.002 --> 06:57.039
Sex rather pales in comparison,
don't you think?

07:00.343 --> 07:04.256
She doesn't need a party,
she needs an intervention.

07:07.559 --> 07:09.868
He led us long ago.

07:10.144 --> 07:12.704
And once he returns,
he will lead us again

07:12.980 --> 07:17.496
and will reward you
for your unwavering faith.

07:21.073 --> 07:25.783
Help us to cleanse him of the poison
that has corrupted him.

07:26.203 --> 07:29.275
Turn him,
that he might lower his guard,

07:29.582 --> 07:32.380
so that we may return him
to the fold.

07:33.253 --> 07:35.084
To his destiny.

07:53.983 --> 07:56.258
<i>Okay, Piper couldn't find the demon
in the Book.</i>

07:56.527 --> 07:57.642
Any luck up here?

07:57.863 --> 07:59.581
Actually, I'm working on
something else.

07:59.824 --> 08:04.102
- A vanquishing potion?
- No, a birthday present.

08:04.869 --> 08:06.063
A birthday present?

08:06.288 --> 08:08.563
Paige, you're not gonna be able
to find the charm bracelet.

08:08.998 --> 08:12.468
Trust me, this will be even better.
The perfect gift.

08:13.503 --> 08:14.777
Okay, what are you talking about?

08:15.005 --> 08:16.916
I figure Piper has no love
in her life right now,

08:17.175 --> 08:19.484
so I think she needs
a little love back in her life.

08:19.802 --> 08:22.270
- Okay, so you're making a love potion?
- No.

08:22.597 --> 08:23.996
I'm making a love machine.

08:25.141 --> 08:28.770
I am making the perfect man.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.511
Are you kidding me?
Are you out of your mind?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.645
No, I don't think I am.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.494
Listen, we've conjured
magical beings before,

08:37.820 --> 08:39.299
so, you know, hey,
what's the big deal?

08:39.530 --> 08:41.839
The big deal is they always
come back to bite us in the ass.

08:42.116 --> 08:43.914
No, this one won't.
He's just gonna be around

08:44.159 --> 08:45.991
for her birthday
from midnight to midnight.

08:46.288 --> 08:48.597
Paige, we can't just conjure up
a sex toy.

08:48.916 --> 08:52.306
Listen, I figure magic owes Piper.

08:52.628 --> 08:54.141
It has taken away
the love of her life,

08:54.378 --> 08:57.211
and now it's threatening to take away
love from the rest of her life?

08:57.548 --> 09:01.427
Look, I get Wyatt is super important.
All right, I do get that.

09:01.761 --> 09:05.117
But I think this could be
for the greater good.

09:06.308 --> 09:08.981
Okay, let's write down
some qualities.

09:09.311 --> 09:11.188
Qualities?
What do you mean, qualities?

09:11.481 --> 09:13.711
You know, qualities
for the perfect man.

09:13.983 --> 09:18.420
Oh, okay, well, I think she would
want someone that lives nearby,

09:18.778 --> 09:20.257
you know, and doesn't travel a lot.

09:20.488 --> 09:22.524
Yeah, well, I would write down
something about

09:22.784 --> 09:24.900
somebody who I could do magic
in front of.

09:25.162 --> 09:26.641
But these are qualities
you and I want,

09:26.913 --> 09:29.222
not qualities that Piper
would necessarily want.

09:29.541 --> 09:31.418
Right, okay.

09:31.669 --> 09:33.785
I think she wants, you know,

09:34.046 --> 09:38.005
a strong man, but someone that's
not afraid to show his sensitive side.

09:38.384 --> 09:40.944
Sensitive but not a wuss-bag.

09:41.262 --> 09:44.572
And someone that is a good listener.

09:44.890 --> 09:48.360
- Okay, good cook.
- Handy around the house.

09:48.728 --> 09:52.801
- Good with kids.
- Gets the whole normal-life thing.

09:53.275 --> 09:56.426
- Has a really big...
- Paige.

09:56.736 --> 09:58.294
Is this the perfect guy or what?

09:59.698 --> 10:01.017
All right, throw it in.

10:04.912 --> 10:06.265
How am I supposed to protect Wyatt

10:06.498 --> 10:09.058
if you don't tell me when a demon
attacks until hours later?

10:09.584 --> 10:12.496
Because, Chris, I'm taking care of it.

10:12.794 --> 10:15.262
That's fine, but what happens
if this demon was the one?

10:15.547 --> 10:18.220
The one who was after Wyatt,
the reason why I came back?

10:18.551 --> 10:21.702
Well, then you're in luck,
because I blew him up.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.555
Not to mention, how many demons
have you said that about so far?

10:25.892 --> 10:28.690
Piper, I've just got Wyatt's
best interest in mind.

10:28.979 --> 10:31.288
So do I. Demon's not in here.

10:32.149 --> 10:34.026
Well, what does it look like?

10:34.401 --> 10:37.757
Tall, robed, with a metal-rod thingy.

10:38.112 --> 10:40.990
Really? Well, that narrows it down.

10:41.324 --> 10:43.280
If another one shows up, I'll be here.

10:43.577 --> 10:45.533
That's just my point, Piper.
What if you're not?

10:45.828 --> 10:47.739
What happens if you're on a date
with a fireman

10:47.998 --> 10:49.556
or whoever else
you're seeing this week?

10:49.834 --> 10:52.268
Look, Chris, I don't wanna
go into it,

10:52.544 --> 10:55.581
but I'm not gonna be out on a date
with a fireman.

10:55.924 --> 10:58.392
Or anybody else, for that matter,
anytime soon,

10:58.718 --> 11:00.470
so that I can focus more on Wyatt.

11:01.553 --> 11:03.623
- What?
- Did I stutter?

11:04.264 --> 11:07.939
Piper, you can't give up
on love. Ever.

11:08.269 --> 11:11.818
- Why not?
- Because you just can't, that's why.

11:12.148 --> 11:13.820
It's not natural.

11:14.943 --> 11:18.697
All I'm saying is you don't have to make
that type of sacrifice to protect Wyatt.

11:19.030 --> 11:23.467
- That's why I'm here.
- You weren't here earlier, were you?

11:23.827 --> 11:26.625
But the only thing that matters
right now is what's best for Wyatt.

11:26.912 --> 11:28.664
This is not what's best for Wyatt,
Piper.

11:28.914 --> 11:29.903
How do you know?

11:30.124 --> 11:32.354
I've seen the future, and this isn't
supposed to happen.

11:32.669 --> 11:34.421
So, what is supposed to happen?

11:34.712 --> 11:36.270
Come on, you know I can't
answer that.

11:36.506 --> 11:38.098
Since you're from the future
to change it,

11:38.342 --> 11:40.412
maybe this one of the things
that needs to be changed.

11:40.719 --> 11:44.678
No, it's not. Believe me, it's not.

11:47.434 --> 11:49.311
Who left this?

11:49.562 --> 11:51.359
If you're so concerned
about protecting Wyatt,

11:51.648 --> 11:54.082
- there's other ways to go about it.
- Like what?

11:54.358 --> 11:57.077
Like letting Leo take him up there
for a while.

11:57.904 --> 11:59.417
Or...

12:02.909 --> 12:04.979
You could always bind his powers.

12:05.453 --> 12:09.207
Leo left me a birthday present.
How sweet.

12:11.502 --> 12:13.140
What do you think
about what I said?

12:13.379 --> 12:14.414
About what?

12:14.632 --> 12:17.305
- About binding Wyatt's powers.
- No way.

12:17.593 --> 12:21.188
Why not? Nobody would ever be
after him and you'd have your life back.

12:23.556 --> 12:25.706
But that would be selfish of me,
wouldn't it?

12:25.975 --> 12:28.409
To put my needs before his destiny?

12:29.395 --> 12:32.910
I'm not being a martyr, Chris.
Really, I'm not. I just get it now.

12:33.234 --> 12:36.749
I'm the mother of a very special child,
that if I do my job right,

12:37.113 --> 12:39.263
he's gonna grow up to do
very special things.

12:39.574 --> 12:41.610
What could possibly be
more important than that?

12:45.954 --> 12:48.991
Sweetie, you go back to sleep.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.963
And I will be right back.

12:57.467 --> 13:00.265
Okay, I can't think of anything else.

13:00.553 --> 13:03.989
One more thing.
Magical pheromones.

13:04.308 --> 13:06.139
Magical pheromones?

13:06.393 --> 13:09.226
Yeah, see, it's just one thing
to give him an extra shot.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.432
To help Piper be a little bit more
receptive since he's only got a day.

13:12.731 --> 13:15.723
I hope we're doing the right thing.
I hope this doesn't backfire.

13:16.027 --> 13:17.380
I don't think it will.

13:17.611 --> 13:21.160
If this were a date, honey,
this would be the martini.

13:21.491 --> 13:23.004
Okay.

13:23.536 --> 13:27.415
<i>A perfect man, we summon now
Another way we don't know how</i>

13:27.748 --> 13:33.106
<i>To make our sister see the light
Somewhere out there is Mr. Right</i>

13:56.112 --> 13:57.181
Hello.

13:58.156 --> 13:59.635
- Perfect.
- Perfect.

14:08.291 --> 14:11.249
- Okay, remember, she's gonna freak.
- Big-time.

14:11.545 --> 14:14.537
- So just get close as you can to her...
- Yeah, really, really close.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.990
- and you just let those pheromones
do their magic.

14:17.259 --> 14:21.093
- So you could do your magic.
- Ladies, ladies, please.

14:21.430 --> 14:24.069
You created me to know
exactly what Piper wants.

14:24.351 --> 14:26.182
Don't worry.

14:33.609 --> 14:35.520
I have a question for you.

14:35.778 --> 14:37.848
Since when is Piper into
hot Latin types?

14:38.113 --> 14:40.263
Since I put in
the hot-Latin-type ingredient.

14:40.533 --> 14:43.445
- Oh, Phoebe.
- What, are you complaining?

14:49.376 --> 14:52.607
Happy birthday, Piper.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.659
Eggs Benedict, easy yolk.

14:56.924 --> 15:01.395
Steamed asparagus, fresh fruit.
Orange juice, no pulp.

15:01.804 --> 15:03.442
How did I do?

15:04.766 --> 15:06.438
Phoebe! Paige!

15:06.685 --> 15:08.118
Yeah?

15:09.146 --> 15:11.137
What's going on? Who is this?

15:11.649 --> 15:15.437
Well, this is your birthday present.

15:17.071 --> 15:19.266
From me, although, you know,
Phoebe helped.

15:19.573 --> 15:23.691
<i>- The breakfast?
- No, the muchacho.</i>

15:26.079 --> 15:32.268
Wait, you...? You hired
a guy for my birthday?

15:32.711 --> 15:35.748
No, we would never hire a guy
for your birthday.

15:36.049 --> 15:39.519
We made him, magically.

15:44.097 --> 15:46.406
You know what,
this is Paige's present for you.

15:46.683 --> 15:48.514
Mine's the surprise birthday party.

15:48.769 --> 15:51.124
I know you're pretty mad,
aren't you?

15:57.529 --> 15:58.564
Traitor.

15:58.780 --> 16:00.418
I knew we should have
used more pheromones.

16:00.658 --> 16:02.649
Hey, you.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.718
- Okay.
- Piper, wait.

16:04.954 --> 16:08.344
No, not until you send him back
to wherever you conjured him from.

16:08.665 --> 16:10.462
We can't, not until
your birthday is over.

16:10.709 --> 16:13.177
Yeah, so why not take advantage
of him while you can?

16:13.504 --> 16:15.495
I mean, figuratively speaking,
of course.

16:15.798 --> 16:17.754
Oh, hell, literally, it is your birthday.

16:18.009 --> 16:21.638
I can't believe you guys did this.
Did you not hear me yesterday?

16:22.013 --> 16:23.082
No, we did, loud and clear.

16:23.306 --> 16:25.900
Yeah, we just wanted you
to change your mind.

16:26.227 --> 16:28.661
So you whipped up a magical gigolo?

16:28.937 --> 16:31.007
Oh, criminy, just give him a chance.

16:31.275 --> 16:33.994
How could you resist him?
Did you look at him?

16:34.317 --> 16:38.105
This is like something we would do
years ago, before we knew better.

16:38.489 --> 16:40.878
But now we do know better,
at least we're supposed to.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.192
You know what? Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

16:44.538 --> 16:46.608
I'm sorry, are you all right?

16:46.915 --> 16:51.545
Yeah, no, I'm pissed, remember?
Are you wearing cologne?

16:51.962 --> 16:56.592
- No, you don't like cologne.
- No, I don't, do I?

16:57.010 --> 16:58.489
But what does she like?

16:58.719 --> 17:02.837
Well, she likes long walks
on the beach,

17:03.223 --> 17:04.941
shopping at the Embarcadero,

17:06.226 --> 17:10.219
lunching at Zuni,
deep-dish moussakas.

17:12.023 --> 17:15.733
Well, that...
Yeah, that sounds great but...

17:16.654 --> 17:18.484
So, what are we waiting for?

17:18.781 --> 17:21.376
No, I can't, because the demon.

17:21.702 --> 17:23.374
We'll take care of the demon.
It's done.

17:23.662 --> 17:25.573
Well, what about Wyatt?
I can't just leave him.

17:25.871 --> 17:27.065
Can't we take him with us?

17:27.665 --> 17:29.860
You know, maybe go to the fair?

17:30.125 --> 17:32.593
Or perhaps the zoo?

17:35.381 --> 17:36.370
I'll get dressed.

17:36.841 --> 17:40.550
I'll get him.
Unless you don't want me to.

17:40.887 --> 17:42.320
No, no, you can get him.

17:42.597 --> 17:45.236
- Okay. Excuse me, girls.
- Yeah.

17:45.518 --> 17:47.588
- Bye.
- Bye.

17:48.521 --> 17:50.876
- Cool your jets, lady, it's for Piper.
- Right.

17:51.147 --> 17:52.216
- Stay on target.
- Yeah.

17:55.486 --> 17:58.398
Oh, finally. I've been calling you for
hours, man. Where have you been?

17:58.739 --> 18:00.138
- What's up?
- What's up?

18:00.366 --> 18:02.357
- Your son was attacked yesterday.
- What?

18:02.619 --> 18:03.938
Don't worry, he's fine.

18:04.163 --> 18:06.040
- Piper vanquished the demon.
- Who was he?

18:06.665 --> 18:08.257
<i>That's the problem,
he's not in the Book.</i>

18:09.168 --> 18:11.682
We have to figure out who he is
in case there's another attempt.

18:11.962 --> 18:13.600
On that point,
I have a radical suggestion,

18:13.839 --> 18:16.307
a way of protecting Wyatt
from any and all future attempts.

18:16.593 --> 18:17.582
I'm listening.

18:17.801 --> 18:19.996
We get the sisters
to bind Wyatt's powers.

18:21.889 --> 18:23.402
- No way.
- Come on, Leo.

18:23.682 --> 18:27.072
Binding Wyatt's powers solves
all our problems, believe me.

18:27.395 --> 18:30.228
No, Wyatt wasn't brought
into this world to be bound.

18:30.523 --> 18:32.115
I can't condone that.

18:32.359 --> 18:34.953
Unless there's something
you're not telling me.

18:35.946 --> 18:38.380
All right, then we need to figure out
who's after Wyatt.

18:38.658 --> 18:40.694
Okay. How?

18:40.994 --> 18:43.952
Right here, above the din of the city.

18:46.456 --> 18:48.287
It's why I come up here.

18:49.209 --> 18:50.483
Just close your eyes.

18:50.752 --> 18:53.061
Rely on your inner senses.

18:54.464 --> 18:55.943
Listen to the wind.

19:18.823 --> 19:20.700
We're running out of volunteers.

19:20.950 --> 19:24.067
If we can't turn the model,
if we can't get it to lower its guard,

19:24.370 --> 19:26.088
we won't be able
to turn the child, either.

19:27.166 --> 19:31.239
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.938
It's because of my faith I raise
the concern, your eminence.

19:34.213 --> 19:36.852
The acolytes grow restless,
the search has been long.

19:37.174 --> 19:38.971
Without reassurance
that he can be converted,

19:39.219 --> 19:41.096
their evil may splinter off or scatter.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.582
What do you suggest?

19:42.806 --> 19:44.762
Another encounter with the child.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.327
To read his mind again, to better see
how his morals have been twisted.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.794
I offer myself to the cause.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.306
Your sacrifice will be rewarded.

19:58.949 --> 20:00.780
But the witches will be
prepared this time,

20:01.074 --> 20:03.508
which means you'll have to go in
as someone they know.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.381
Trust.

20:20.637 --> 20:21.865
Him.

20:27.519 --> 20:29.794
Fly to New York right now, Jason?

20:30.064 --> 20:31.497
You're so cute.
I would love to, but...

20:31.732 --> 20:35.122
But she's busy setting
a demonic alarm system.

20:35.945 --> 20:41.497
No, she said we're busy watching
a mechanic set up an alarm system.

20:41.910 --> 20:44.822
You know us girls
can never be too careful.

20:45.122 --> 20:46.714
Baby, can I call you back later?

20:46.958 --> 20:48.710
Okay, I love you too. Bye.

20:48.961 --> 20:50.917
- Cute, very cute.
- Just trying to help out.

20:51.169 --> 20:52.522
What, you trying to blow my secret?

20:52.754 --> 20:55.029
You said you're gonna have
to tell him sooner or later.

20:55.299 --> 20:58.450
Yeah, but I wanna be the one
to tell him, not AT&T.

20:58.803 --> 21:01.317
Hey, why are you in such
a good mood?

21:01.597 --> 21:05.749
Well, it's nice to practice magic
without feeling guilty.

21:07.021 --> 21:10.457
I guess we all have guy problems,
right?

21:13.152 --> 21:14.551
Where's Piper?

21:15.571 --> 21:16.686
She's out, why?

21:16.946 --> 21:19.380
We know who attacked Wyatt,
and they're gonna attack again.

21:19.699 --> 21:21.655
- Who?
- A demonic cult called the Order.

21:21.910 --> 21:24.629
Used to be the most powerful force
until their leader was vanquished.

21:24.913 --> 21:27.950
And guess what?
They think he's been reincarnated.

21:29.209 --> 21:30.528
Wyatt?

21:30.753 --> 21:33.028
He's young enough
to be turned evil, especially by them.

21:33.964 --> 21:35.443
Where is Wyatt, is he with Piper?

21:36.885 --> 21:40.275
Anybody home? A little help here.

21:40.806 --> 21:42.558
Where have you been?

21:42.806 --> 21:45.240
Well, everywhere, actually.

21:45.517 --> 21:48.668
First we went shopping,
and then we went for a boat ride,

21:48.980 --> 21:53.531
and then we had a picnic in the park,
and then we stopped at the fair.

21:53.902 --> 21:55.221
Piper?

21:55.487 --> 21:57.682
- Where's Wyatt?
- Oh, he's coming.

21:57.989 --> 22:00.742
<i>If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands</i>

22:01.076 --> 22:03.670
<i>If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands</i>

22:05.289 --> 22:06.324
Hello.

22:08.707 --> 22:10.060
Who are you?

22:11.627 --> 22:14.061
He's... He's, you know, just a date.

22:14.632 --> 22:16.065
A guy.

22:16.342 --> 22:18.697
You know, you don't
have a name yet, do you?

22:19.471 --> 22:21.268
What does that mean,
he doesn't have a name?

22:22.307 --> 22:25.424
Why not call me David?
You've always liked that name, no?

22:25.769 --> 22:30.001
No. I mean, yes. Isn't he perfect?

22:31.526 --> 22:32.515
What the hell is going on?

22:32.777 --> 22:34.608
You don't have to feel
threatened by me, Leo.

22:34.903 --> 22:37.019
No one could ever replace you
in Wyatt's eyes.

22:37.448 --> 22:40.281
And Piper wouldn't want anyone to.

22:41.827 --> 22:43.977
- Phoebe?
- Yeah, okay.

22:44.247 --> 22:46.477
Why don't you guys
put Wyatt down for a nap.

22:46.791 --> 22:50.227
I'm sure he's really tired
from all this excitement. Come on

22:50.588 --> 22:51.782
Okay.

22:52.005 --> 22:55.520
<i>If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands</i>

22:57.720 --> 23:01.076
And don't forget to turn off
the demonic alarm system.

23:01.389 --> 23:05.621
You know, in case the baby
mistakes him for a...

23:07.062 --> 23:08.051
...demon.

23:10.273 --> 23:12.707
All right, fine. So I made him
out of my own little brew.

23:13.027 --> 23:14.142
You what?

23:14.403 --> 23:17.281
Piper was gonna give up on love,
on her birthday, nonetheless.

23:17.615 --> 23:19.651
- So you conjured a man?
- No.

23:19.951 --> 23:22.260
Not just a man, the perfect man.

23:22.996 --> 23:25.590
See, he's somebody who knows
exactly what she wants,

23:25.914 --> 23:29.065
and he's just gonna be here
long enough to straighten her out.

23:29.418 --> 23:31.010
Twenty-four hours.
It's great, right?

23:31.295 --> 23:35.527
Yeah, not even 24, more like eight.
And then, sadly, he goes poof.

23:35.925 --> 23:39.964
Yeah. You don't want her to live life
without love, do you, Leo?

23:41.431 --> 23:44.025
We'll talk about this later,
after we deal with the Order.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.549
Okay.

23:46.603 --> 23:48.992
Is this a bad time?
I just wanted to drop this off.

23:49.315 --> 23:52.352
Darryl, why didn't you
just wait till dinner?

23:52.900 --> 23:53.889
Dinner?

23:55.904 --> 23:57.622
Actually, this is for Wyatt.

23:57.864 --> 23:59.536
So he has a little something
to open up too.

23:59.824 --> 24:01.382
Oh, that's so sweet.

24:04.704 --> 24:07.172
Sheila's idea, actually.
Mind if I give it to him?

24:07.458 --> 24:09.335
Oh, sure, yeah. They're upstairs.

24:09.586 --> 24:10.735
Thanks.

24:12.255 --> 24:14.405
Don't you think maybe we should
cancel the dinner party?

24:14.716 --> 24:16.229
No.

24:40.409 --> 24:42.877
- Darryl, right?
- Right.

24:44.538 --> 24:46.130
How's it going?

24:47.624 --> 24:49.137
Hi, what are you doing here?

24:49.627 --> 24:52.585
Oh, I just bought the little guy
a present.

24:52.922 --> 24:56.835
Oh, that's really sweet,
but we just put him down for a nap.

24:57.385 --> 24:59.945
I'll sneak it in so he can see it
when he wakes up.

25:00.221 --> 25:02.894
- He'll never know I was here.
- Okay.

25:03.894 --> 25:05.612
No problem.

25:28.753 --> 25:30.072
- What's up?
- We need to talk.

25:30.295 --> 25:32.013
Wyatt may be in danger.

25:33.881 --> 25:35.599
Why is it doing that?

25:37.176 --> 25:39.167
You stay here.

25:48.647 --> 25:49.966
- You're okay.
- Is he okay?

25:50.190 --> 25:51.179
You're okay.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.482
Did he hurt him?

25:55.363 --> 25:58.036
No, I think he's okay.

26:03.578 --> 26:05.296
Success.

26:05.539 --> 26:07.609
We shall see.

26:23.059 --> 26:25.527
He's ready to come home.

26:35.154 --> 26:36.428
- Darryl?
- He's okay.

26:36.656 --> 26:38.294
He said they didn't get
anywhere near him.

26:38.533 --> 26:39.682
Oh, thank God.

26:39.909 --> 26:42.264
Yeah, my question is how they
even know to impersonate him.

26:42.579 --> 26:45.616
They must have been watching you,
who you trusted and let near him.

26:45.958 --> 26:47.232
That's really creepy.

26:47.460 --> 26:50.179
It's gonna get a lot creepier if we don't
stop them getting to Wyatt.

26:50.503 --> 26:51.982
Well, we have a thought about that.

26:52.714 --> 26:56.229
- "We"?
- Yeah, well, we've been talking,

26:56.551 --> 26:59.190
and I think we need to give Chris'
idea another chance.

26:59.514 --> 27:03.063
- What idea?
- About binding Wyatt's powers.

27:03.393 --> 27:04.746
- What?
- What?

27:05.020 --> 27:06.499
I'm just saying
we should consider it.

27:06.730 --> 27:09.847
- If you think about it, it makes sense.
- You can't be serious.

27:10.192 --> 27:11.910
Actually, she's never been
more serious.

27:12.486 --> 27:13.919
Excuse me, I was talking to her.

27:14.738 --> 27:16.729
This doesn't sound like you, Piper.

27:17.031 --> 27:19.704
Doesn't it?
Piper wants to protect her son.

27:20.034 --> 27:23.424
She wants a normal life.
This way she can have both.

27:23.955 --> 27:25.593
Hey, that was my argument.

27:25.874 --> 27:26.989
Well, that's a good one.

27:27.250 --> 27:30.367
No, that's not a good one.
That's a bad one, a very bad one.

27:30.671 --> 27:33.060
One that's been discussed
and discarded already.

27:33.382 --> 27:35.691
But that was before demonic cults
started targeting him.

27:36.010 --> 27:37.238
- This could be...
- Oh, what?

27:37.512 --> 27:39.821
Just another big, bad evil thing
that's coming after him?

27:40.098 --> 27:41.087
Yeah, yeah, we got it.

27:41.306 --> 27:44.059
- That still isn't a good enough reason.
- Well, Piper thinks it is.

27:44.434 --> 27:46.345
Hey, buddy,
don't forget who made you.

27:47.354 --> 27:48.992
That's right, you did make him,
didn't you?

27:49.231 --> 27:50.630
Piper, I don't understand.

27:50.899 --> 27:53.572
Yesterday you were willing to give up
everything for Wyatt's future.

27:53.861 --> 27:56.136
- Why this now?
- Well, you should know.

27:56.406 --> 28:01.355
You're the one that showed me
what I really wanted and really need.

28:01.787 --> 28:03.220
She's got us there.

28:03.455 --> 28:06.015
Well, it doesn't matter because
it's gonna take the power of three

28:06.292 --> 28:08.203
to bind someone
as powerful as Wyatt,

28:08.917 --> 28:10.066
and I'm not gonna support it.

28:10.336 --> 28:11.405
Neither am I.

28:11.671 --> 28:13.901
Well, then we have a problem,
because I am.

28:14.716 --> 28:18.550
All right, why don't we all
just take a deep breath, okay?

28:18.929 --> 28:21.648
Leo, why don't you orb Wyatt
up there until we can figure this out?

28:22.307 --> 28:24.025
Gladly. Do you mind?

28:24.310 --> 28:25.948
No, please.

28:35.904 --> 28:37.895
All right, and why don't we...

28:38.157 --> 28:39.670
- David, right?
- David.

28:39.908 --> 28:42.980
Why don't you come with me
and let the girls talk alone for a minute.

28:47.792 --> 28:49.703
So you got quite an influence
on Piper, don't you?

28:49.961 --> 28:51.997
Well, I just reflect what she wants.

28:53.214 --> 28:54.442
Interesting.

28:54.716 --> 28:56.866
They just wrote down what
she wanted, and that was that?

28:57.386 --> 28:59.946
I don't know. I guess.

29:01.556 --> 29:03.114
Let's see.

29:12.109 --> 29:13.781
What were we just talking about?

29:14.863 --> 29:17.331
Paige, and what she looks for
in a man.

29:17.615 --> 29:18.604
Paige?

29:20.328 --> 29:22.967
She wants a man who she can
openly practice magic around.

29:25.081 --> 29:26.833
One she won't feel suppressed by.

29:27.126 --> 29:28.354
Good, very good.

29:29.961 --> 29:35.240
And what about Phoebe?

29:38.221 --> 29:41.497
Phoebe? She wants the same thing.

29:42.434 --> 29:45.949
Plus she wants him to be available
to live near her home.

29:46.272 --> 29:47.387
That's what she wants.

29:47.648 --> 29:50.003
This potion packs a hell of a punch,
doesn't it?

29:50.274 --> 29:52.504
Of course, in order for them to be
with the perfect man,

29:52.818 --> 29:54.729
is if they're happy
with each other first.

29:54.987 --> 29:58.024
And the only way they can be
happy with each other first

29:58.325 --> 30:01.715
is agreeing to bind Wyatt's powers.

30:10.755 --> 30:14.065
Pheromones? What the hell.

30:16.635 --> 30:18.034
This is my son we're talking about.

30:18.261 --> 30:19.774
Piper, you're not listening to reason.

30:20.013 --> 30:21.605
Phoebe, his life is in jeopardy.

30:21.849 --> 30:24.443
And binding his powers may be
the only way to save him.

30:24.726 --> 30:27.638
That's all that saved him.
Paige, please help me.

30:27.939 --> 30:30.089
Well, I think that...

30:31.484 --> 30:34.157
Oh, here, allow me.

30:35.989 --> 30:38.184
Just relax, okay?

30:40.951 --> 30:43.101
You keep all the tension
in your shoulders.

30:43.370 --> 30:44.485
You're right.

30:45.958 --> 30:47.516
I love your cologne.

30:48.543 --> 30:50.420
Hey, that's my birthday present.

30:50.713 --> 30:52.385
All day and all night.

30:55.217 --> 30:57.811
Hey, what's going on? I thought you
were gonna keep him occupied?

30:58.096 --> 31:01.406
I was, but I figured I had to break
the impasse between you three, so...

31:01.725 --> 31:03.602
Really, how?

31:05.730 --> 31:07.004
Hey.

31:14.655 --> 31:17.533
Don't worry.
I'm here for you, Phoebe.

31:18.993 --> 31:22.906
Not off taking care of business
in some faraway land.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.284
Yeah, I like the sound of that.

31:25.875 --> 31:28.867
So, what do we think about
binding Wyatt's powers?

31:29.171 --> 31:30.650
Knock, knock.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.151
Surprise.

31:32.714 --> 31:36.423
Oh, hey. You guys need this?
Found this by the door.

31:36.802 --> 31:39.714
Yes, we need it by the door.
Don't touch our crystals.

31:40.056 --> 31:42.445
At least we know it's really Darryl.

31:43.768 --> 31:47.522
- Hey.
- Oh, and who's he?

31:47.857 --> 31:52.248
- Oh, this is David.
- Hi.

31:53.488 --> 31:55.763
Actually, guys, the dinner has
been cancelled, sorry.

31:56.366 --> 32:00.564
Why? The girls still want to party,
don't you?

32:00.910 --> 32:02.468
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.135
But the dinner isn't even made.

32:05.416 --> 32:07.611
Oh, I can fix that.

32:07.876 --> 32:13.553
<i>On Piper's day, set this table
With all the favours you are able</i>

32:24.810 --> 32:25.799
Not bad, huh?

32:26.019 --> 32:28.579
No, no, this isn't right.
This isn't what they want.

32:28.856 --> 32:31.211
Hey, if it makes them happy,
it's all I want.

32:31.525 --> 32:33.163
Come on, have a seat.

32:33.444 --> 32:36.959
What about Wyatt? Anyone?

32:39.284 --> 32:41.798
The child, he's gone.

32:42.079 --> 32:45.276
- Can you sense him?
- No.

32:45.583 --> 32:50.020
But they won't keep him away
for long. We'll wait.

32:55.509 --> 32:59.946
So how long have you known
the girls?

33:00.306 --> 33:02.866
Fourteen, 15 hours, I guess.

33:03.517 --> 33:04.870
Did you say hours?

33:05.103 --> 33:08.812
Oh, yeah, I made him, magically.

33:09.566 --> 33:11.602
Actually, we both made him.

33:11.902 --> 33:12.937
For my birthday.

33:14.236 --> 33:15.874
- Hell of a gift.
- Yeah.

33:16.114 --> 33:18.867
We just wanted to remind Piper
of the importance of love.

33:19.409 --> 33:20.398
Love?

33:20.618 --> 33:24.657
Spiritual, emotional,
deep-in-your-heart love.

33:25.041 --> 33:28.477
The kind you should never,
ever stop searching for, Piper.

33:28.836 --> 33:31.555
I know, you're right, I know.

33:31.840 --> 33:33.034
You're going to have it too.

33:34.092 --> 33:35.684
I promise.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.005
Your normal life.

33:39.223 --> 33:40.258
What about me?

33:40.723 --> 33:43.317
You shouldn't have to hide
your secret anymore.

33:43.852 --> 33:46.924
- I understand you.
- I know you do.

33:48.482 --> 33:54.239
- What about my dinner?
- Magical, Paige, just the way I like it.

33:55.991 --> 33:57.743
They're really good peas.

34:00.829 --> 34:03.866
- Excuse me. Wyatt, anyone?
- Later.

34:09.168 --> 34:11.637
Is this some kind of demonic thing?

34:11.964 --> 34:13.761
No, it's some sort of
messed-up thing.

34:17.594 --> 34:19.585
- Maybe we should go.
- Good idea.

34:20.975 --> 34:24.092
Hey, y'all need to make
your own present.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.692
Hey, off of the lap.

34:39.118 --> 34:40.187
I see.

34:41.203 --> 34:44.320
- You're gonna play with cake now.
- Cake!

34:48.795 --> 34:51.467
Girls, girls. Come on,
there's plenty of me to go around.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.222
Well, thanks for dinner.

34:59.513 --> 35:01.151
Happy birthday.

35:03.519 --> 35:05.475
How are you making them happy
if they're fighting?

35:05.729 --> 35:07.526
Get them to
bind Wyatt's powers now.

35:11.277 --> 35:12.630
Are you sure about this?

35:12.862 --> 35:15.695
What you want more than anything
is to get along.

35:15.991 --> 35:17.344
And this will help you do that.

35:17.575 --> 35:21.011
I'm pretty sure what we want more
than anything is a good dry cleaner.

35:21.330 --> 35:22.763
Leo.

35:30.631 --> 35:32.781
- What happened?
- You don't wanna know.

35:33.092 --> 35:34.844
We're binding Wyatt's powers.

35:35.135 --> 35:38.047
- What?
- We already decided.

35:39.391 --> 35:40.380
You can't be serious.

35:49.232 --> 35:51.302
He is one of us now.

36:01.663 --> 36:03.062
Listen to me, what are you doing?

36:03.290 --> 36:07.920
The pheromones wore off,
right after they took my son.

36:08.295 --> 36:10.445
You don't seriously
believe this is my fault, do you?

36:10.757 --> 36:13.476
So it's just a big coincidence
we all fell under Mr. Right's spell?

36:13.758 --> 36:16.591
And then suddenly we all wanna
bind Wyatt's powers?

36:16.928 --> 36:18.964
You see, Chris, what they really
want is for you...

36:19.222 --> 36:20.450
For you to leave.

36:21.558 --> 36:22.593
I knew that.

36:25.729 --> 36:28.197
- This is crazy. Leo, tell them.
- Tell them what?

36:28.524 --> 36:30.037
I'm wondering
the same thing myself.

36:30.526 --> 36:34.519
Okay, so what if I did?
I was only trying to protect Wyatt.

36:34.865 --> 36:36.981
- By tricking us?
- I had to.

36:37.242 --> 36:39.119
- Why?
- Because the only reason I came here

36:39.368 --> 36:40.767
is to keep Wyatt from turning evil.

36:42.037 --> 36:43.026
Turning evil?

36:43.246 --> 36:45.476
Don't you mean "stopping evil
from hurting him"?

36:46.626 --> 36:48.582
I didn't think you'd help me
if you knew the truth.

36:49.128 --> 36:51.005
I knew you wouldn't.

36:51.506 --> 36:55.021
The evil from the future
I came back to stop isn't a demon.

36:56.845 --> 36:58.642
- It's Wyatt.
- You're lying.

36:58.889 --> 37:00.288
No, I'm not.

37:00.515 --> 37:02.824
He's gonna grow up
and terrorize people with his powers.

37:03.144 --> 37:04.463
Take over.

37:04.729 --> 37:06.401
Kill, even.

37:08.648 --> 37:10.604
Why should we believe you
after all the lies?

37:10.901 --> 37:13.461
- Because you have to.
- No, Chris, we don't, actually.

37:13.778 --> 37:15.734
Fine, don't. Either way,
we need to save Wyatt now.

37:15.989 --> 37:17.468
And I'm the one who
knows how to do it.

37:17.700 --> 37:19.452
- Oh, really? How?
- The Order.

37:19.701 --> 37:22.499
They used their powers to turn him,
to reverse his morality.

37:22.830 --> 37:25.344
See, he thinks bad is good now
and good is bad.

37:25.625 --> 37:27.820
- That's why his shield repelled you.
- So?

37:28.086 --> 37:30.884
So Wyatt brings his shield up
around me.

37:31.171 --> 37:33.287
- He thinks I'm a threat.
- Yeah, so do I.

37:34.342 --> 37:37.334
Listen to me. They reversed
his sense of morality.

37:37.679 --> 37:41.638
That means his shield will protect him
from you, but not from me.

37:42.435 --> 37:44.824
Please, I'm the only one
who can save him.

37:46.647 --> 37:49.525
- Let me help.
- Chris, we don't need your help.

37:49.817 --> 37:53.093
I will get my son back, and when I do,
I don't wanna see you anymore.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.718
I'm sorry.

38:17.681 --> 38:21.913
Behold, he has returned to us,

38:22.267 --> 38:25.862
to his rightful place,
to one day lead us back to...

38:45.417 --> 38:47.453
He protects me now,

38:47.960 --> 38:49.313
not you.

39:08.774 --> 39:10.492
Pick up the sceptre
and point it at Wyatt.

39:15.321 --> 39:16.879
Trust me.

39:31.341 --> 39:33.980
How come he didn't raise his shield
back up for you?

39:34.260 --> 39:35.932
I don't know.

39:36.722 --> 39:38.872
Looks like he trusts me now,
at least.

40:01.582 --> 40:03.015
Good place to think, isn't it?

40:03.625 --> 40:06.014
- What do you want?
- Just to talk.

40:07.252 --> 40:10.449
You know, Chris,
trust is a precious commodity.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.873
Once you lose it,
it's pretty hard to get it back.

40:14.803 --> 40:16.361
Where'd you read that,
a fortune cookie?

40:16.637 --> 40:18.548
Don't be a smart-ass.
It doesn't help your cause.

40:18.807 --> 40:21.605
My cause? Pretty much
screwed that up, don't you think?

40:22.519 --> 40:23.668
I don't know.

40:24.313 --> 40:25.666
Are you saying you still trust me?

40:25.940 --> 40:27.851
It's not my trust that matters,
it's the sisters'.

40:30.693 --> 40:32.172
I know.

40:34.989 --> 40:35.978
So, what do I do?

40:36.574 --> 40:38.132
Just be straight with them, that's all.

40:38.744 --> 40:40.097
Don't manipulate them.

40:40.370 --> 40:42.167
Even if it is for the right reason.

40:45.001 --> 40:47.595
And for what it's worth,
yes, I do trust you.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.458
After all, you saved my son
from turning evil, didn't you?

40:54.094 --> 40:55.527
For now.

41:05.563 --> 41:08.282
Hi, I was just coming up to find you.

41:08.566 --> 41:10.238
I know.

41:11.152 --> 41:13.825
Yeah, see that's still
kind of weird to me.

41:14.156 --> 41:15.475
I know that too.

41:17.284 --> 41:19.673
Listen, thanks for cleaning up
the mess.

41:19.954 --> 41:22.104
You really are a perfect guy.

41:22.955 --> 41:23.944
My pleasure.

41:26.167 --> 41:27.646
Well...

41:29.003 --> 41:32.359
...I already said goodbye
to your sisters.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.431
Now it's your turn.

41:36.303 --> 41:39.261
I feel like I should apologize
or something.

41:39.557 --> 41:40.626
Why?

41:41.016 --> 41:42.768
I'm okay
with what's about to happen.

41:43.686 --> 41:46.325
Really. I was made that way.

41:47.689 --> 41:48.838
Weird.

41:49.108 --> 41:50.905
Did you at least
have a good birthday?

41:52.654 --> 41:56.203
It was interesting, to say the least.

41:57.409 --> 41:59.320
You can't live without love, Piper.

41:59.619 --> 42:01.257
We both know that.

42:01.538 --> 42:03.529
That's all your sisters
were trying to tell you.

42:11.216 --> 42:13.127
Don't ever stop dreaming about me.

42:13.384 --> 42:15.500
And never stop looking for love.

42:29.068 --> 42:30.467
Happy birthday, Piper.

42:50.840 --> 42:52.956
You go to sleep.
