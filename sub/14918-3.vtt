00:01.074 --> 00:02.274
Radius...
Mm-hmm.

00:02.342 --> 00:03.976
Ulna...
Mm-hmm.

00:04.043 --> 00:05.444
Olecranon...

00:05.511 --> 00:07.713
It's like dating a french guy.

00:07.780 --> 00:09.014
Bonjour.

00:09.082 --> 00:12.084
It's latin, and by the way,
we are way past dating.

00:12.151 --> 00:15.220
Mm. That's why I'm going wedding
dress shopping with Kitty today.

00:15.288 --> 00:18.190
With Kitty?
Mm-hmm. Well, I helped her find her dress.

00:18.257 --> 00:21.226
I figured we could be
each other's good luck charms

00:21.294 --> 00:23.228
In the dress department.
Mm. Oh, that's sweet.

00:23.296 --> 00:24.629
Mm-hmm.

00:24.697 --> 00:26.598
Mmm. Can I tell you my fantasy?

00:26.666 --> 00:29.234
No, I won't be a slutty bride.

00:29.302 --> 00:30.769
Damn it.

00:30.837 --> 00:33.705
Well, maybe you can just buy
a dress that shows your...

00:33.773 --> 00:35.340
Yes?
Humerus...

00:35.408 --> 00:37.209
Your acromion...

00:37.276 --> 00:38.810
Mm.

00:38.878 --> 00:41.079
And your... mm...

00:41.147 --> 00:42.748
Cheek.

00:42.815 --> 00:45.884
You don't know the medical term for cheekbone?

00:45.952 --> 00:48.653
Oh, you know what? You are
shattering a guy's confidence

00:48.721 --> 00:52.457
On the first day of gross anatomy.
Me on. Nothing ever happens
on the first day anyways.

00:52.525 --> 00:55.327
You get your textbooks and the syllabus.
Yeah, and apparently a lab partner.

00:55.395 --> 00:57.462
It better not be a hot girl.

00:59.098 --> 01:01.033
I just hope it's not someone stupid

01:01.100 --> 01:04.503
who doesn't know what he's doing.
Mm, seems like you're getting
your confidence back.

01:04.569 --> 01:05.871
Mm.

01:05.938 --> 01:07.939
Now where were we... Doctor?

01:08.007 --> 01:09.474
Doctor?

01:14.914 --> 01:17.716
I have a real good feeling about this, Kitty.

01:20.920 --> 01:23.321
Hey, guys. Whatever happens,
I'm sorry about the wait.Th it.

01:23.389 --> 01:26.324
You know, you can go right ahead and... and tell me.

01:26.392 --> 01:29.294
I need to talk to you about your CT scan.

01:29.362 --> 01:32.764
Oh. Now thankfully, your bone marrow is clean,

01:32.832 --> 01:35.667
but this bright area here is an enlarged lymph node

01:35.735 --> 01:38.503
in the hila of your lung.

01:38.571 --> 01:40.906
There's another cluster in your bowel,

01:40.973 --> 01:43.275
and there's some more
in your retroperitoneum...

01:43.342 --> 01:47.312
that's the area behind
your abdominal cavity.

01:47.380 --> 01:48.814
So...

01:48.881 --> 01:50.882
s... so it's spread.

01:50.950 --> 01:52.417
Yeah, unfortunately,

01:52.485 --> 01:55.353
which, um, puts it at stage III.

02:00.426 --> 02:03.428
Look, I know that this sounds scary,

02:03.496 --> 02:05.931
but compared to other
cancers, stage III lymphoma

02:05.998 --> 02:08.900
can have a good outcome
with proper treatment.

02:08.967 --> 02:11.903
What is the proper treatment?

02:11.971 --> 02:13.872
Well, there are basically two options.

02:13.940 --> 02:16.041
Um, one... the standard of care, is r-chop.

02:16.109 --> 02:17.809
That's a chemotherapy cocktail.

02:17.877 --> 02:20.579
And what's the other option?

02:20.646 --> 02:22.848
Well, there's a drug
that was developed in Europe

02:22.915 --> 02:24.349
called rapamycin.

02:24.417 --> 02:26.785
Um, a hospital in Boston
is conducting clinical trials,

02:26.853 --> 02:28.820
and Kitty may be eligible.

02:28.888 --> 02:31.556
But you have to go there for treatment,

02:31.624 --> 02:33.558
and it could last six months.

02:33.626 --> 02:36.194
Now they are showing
a somewhat better prognosis,

02:36.262 --> 02:39.131
but the risks of complications are also higher.

02:39.198 --> 02:40.599
Um, heart damage,

02:40.666 --> 02:42.601
it could jeopardize your immune system,

02:42.668 --> 02:45.871
which would already be
compromised by the chemo.

02:48.074 --> 02:51.309
I wish that there was a clear-cut choice,

02:51.377 --> 02:54.045
but there are pros and cons to both.

02:54.113 --> 02:56.548
I only do the standard regimen.

02:56.616 --> 02:58.783
Because you think it's a better treatment?

02:58.851 --> 03:00.986
No, because she practices here,

03:01.053 --> 03:03.989
and the... the... the trial's in Boston.

03:04.056 --> 03:09.127
You know what? Why don't
I give you the research?

03:09.195 --> 03:11.796
You can take it home, read it over

03:11.864 --> 03:13.765
and then you can discuss your options.

03:13.833 --> 03:15.200
Okay?

03:15.268 --> 03:19.037
But, um, I have to stress, Kitty,

03:19.105 --> 03:22.440
That the sooner you make
a decision, the better.

03:22.508 --> 03:25.877
Okay.

03:25.945 --> 03:28.446
Okay.

03:28.514 --> 03:30.248
Thank you.

03:30.316 --> 03:33.084
Travis, I don't care that
you work for governor kern.

03:33.152 --> 03:34.553
You know the protocol.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.254
The senator's the ranking official

03:36.322 --> 03:38.757
when it comes to greeting international guests.
Nice try,

03:38.824 --> 03:40.692
but the governor of California is gonna be

03:40.760 --> 03:43.461
At the bottom of those stairs
ahen the Prince of Wales

03:43.529 --> 03:47.098
sets his pretty royal toe on California soil.
Really? Well, then I'd hate to see your face

03:47.166 --> 03:49.100
when his royal highness
walks straight past her

03:49.168 --> 03:51.636
and says hi to the senator
because they played golf

03:51.704 --> 03:53.371
together in Scotland.

03:53.439 --> 03:55.874
I didn't know you had a baby.

03:55.942 --> 03:59.511
You know, maybe... maybe we can,
uh, you know, set up...

03:59.579 --> 04:02.447
something with the prince
at the hotel, like a photo-op.
Do I need to call 9-1-1?

04:02.515 --> 04:05.016
I think he's hungry.
Or maybe he's just wet.

04:05.084 --> 04:06.985
Scotty! Uh, it's... it's not a baby.

04:07.053 --> 04:09.187
Yeah, well, whatever it is, deal with it.

04:09.255 --> 04:11.423
Look, I'm glad we settled this issue.

04:11.490 --> 04:14.092
Uh, you know what? We didn't settle any...

04:14.160 --> 04:17.963
What are you doing? That was important.
You keep insisting we can manage
a baby with two careers,

04:18.029 --> 04:20.332
so I thought we'd have
a little dress rehearsal.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.367
Well, you know what?
Your timing sucks.

04:22.435 --> 04:25.303
I have this visit and two
press releases to get out today.
Yeah, well, you know what?

04:25.371 --> 04:27.305
I have tonight's menu to prepare.

04:27.373 --> 04:30.041
And that crying baby? Someone
needs to change his diaper.

04:30.109 --> 04:35.847
Uh-oh. It's... it's a poopy one.
You made your point.
We'll talk about this later.

04:35.915 --> 04:37.682
Yeah, well, it's always later,
Kevin, that's the problem.

04:41.687 --> 04:43.021
Nice balance.

04:43.089 --> 04:44.889
Fruit forward.

04:44.957 --> 04:46.891
A little smoke in the finish, huh?

04:46.959 --> 04:48.927
All done? Thank you so much.

04:48.995 --> 04:51.196
You're very welcome.
Thank you.

04:51.264 --> 04:53.665
So tell me something...
that's what we're bidding on?

04:53.733 --> 04:56.134
Mm. 10,000 gallons,

04:56.202 --> 04:58.637
if the price stays under $5.25 a gallon.

04:58.704 --> 05:02.173
Oh! $5.25? Nobody's gonna bid $5.25 for that swill.

05:02.241 --> 05:05.277
Trust me. You take that swill
and you add it to our grapes,

05:05.344 --> 05:07.812
and you will get a nice bottle of wine.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.781
Oh, holly, that's short-term thinking.

05:09.849 --> 05:11.783
I don't care how cheaply you're gonna sell it.

05:11.851 --> 05:13.752
In the long run, it's gonna ruin our brand.

05:13.819 --> 05:16.688
You know, how many
times do I have to tell you,

05:16.756 --> 05:19.924
Saul, that we are gonna market
under a fferent label?

05:21.627 --> 05:23.628
What, old flame?

05:23.696 --> 05:26.331
No, just a business acquaintance.

05:26.399 --> 05:28.600
Saul?

05:28.668 --> 05:32.270
I heard a rumor your family had
expanded into the wine business.

05:32.338 --> 05:34.039
Yeah, well, how about that?

05:34.106 --> 05:36.074
What about you? How's the cattle business, hmm?

05:36.142 --> 05:40.011
It runs itself, Saul.
This is my new hobby now.
Great.

05:40.079 --> 05:44.215
You know, at our age, it's good
to keep, uh, your mind fresh.
Yeah. Oh, sorry. This is Holly Harper.

05:44.283 --> 05:46.217
She's the President of Ojai Foods.
Hi.

05:46.285 --> 05:49.254
And this gentleman is Dennis York.
A woman in charge.

05:49.322 --> 05:52.457
Well, well. William certainly would have approved.

05:52.525 --> 05:55.694
Sorry to hear of his passing, by the way.

05:55.761 --> 05:57.228
It's a terrible loss.

05:57.296 --> 06:00.098
Your concern is touching, Dennis.

06:02.435 --> 06:04.569
Well, good luck with the bidding.

06:04.637 --> 06:07.105
Nice to meet you, Holly Harper.

06:07.173 --> 06:10.041
Let's do it.

06:10.109 --> 06:13.044
Wow. This is inspiring.
There is a whole community

06:13.112 --> 06:14.979
of people that have been through this,

06:15.047 --> 06:17.315
and they're all really positive.

06:17.383 --> 06:19.317
Listen, there's a Febbie Feelwell from Florida,

06:19.385 --> 06:21.353
and she says the r-chop was "very doable."

06:21.420 --> 06:24.456
She was diagnoseth stage IV lymphoma,

06:24.523 --> 06:27.359
and now she's n.E.D....
No evidence of disease.

06:27.426 --> 06:29.928
Oh, wow. Look at this.

06:29.995 --> 06:32.130
What?
Look at this.

06:32.198 --> 06:36.000
That's a wedding dress.
Can you imagine how good
that would look on Rebecca?

06:36.068 --> 06:37.502
Honey, I thought we were...

06:37.570 --> 06:40.238
We were researching treatment options, Kitty.

06:40.306 --> 06:43.441
Well, we were, but now I'm
researching wedding dresses.

06:43.509 --> 06:47.212
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look at this one. Look at that.

06:47.279 --> 06:50.415
I mean, that almost makes me
want to get married again.
It's really beaut...

06:50.483 --> 06:53.518
Honey, you heard the doctor.
You have to make a decision now.

06:53.586 --> 06:56.054
I will, but... but, um, we're going shopping,

06:56.122 --> 06:58.957
and I need to help Rebecca find a wedding dress.
All right. All right.

06:59.024 --> 07:01.693
Well, are you gonna tell her what's going on?

07:01.761 --> 07:03.762
Yes. Yes, of course,

07:03.829 --> 07:06.231
right when she's zipping up
her Carolina Herrera.

07:06.298 --> 07:09.701
I know you don't want anyone
to know about this yet, Kitty,

07:09.769 --> 07:12.303
but everyone here talks about how important it is

07:12.371 --> 07:14.806
to have a strong support system.

07:14.874 --> 07:17.809
Mom, you need to get offline.
I will figure this out.

07:17.877 --> 07:20.712
I... I will make the right
decision, and I promise you,

07:20.780 --> 07:23.214
I will be N.E.D. no evidence of disease.

07:23.282 --> 07:24.716
Yes, never enough doughnuts,

07:24.784 --> 07:28.953
never enough dresses, never...

07:29.021 --> 07:31.356
I love you.

07:31.424 --> 07:33.658
Mm.

07:35.661 --> 07:37.595
Ha ha!

07:39.398 --> 07:41.332
She went shopping?

07:41.400 --> 07:42.667
Yes.

07:42.735 --> 07:45.570
Look, I... I understand she...
she needs a distraction,

07:45.638 --> 07:48.072
but, Robert, there really isn't time for that.

07:48.140 --> 07:51.342
Do you know what her prognosis is? 55%.

07:51.410 --> 07:53.478
Yeah, with r-chop, but I just got off the phone

07:53.546 --> 07:55.513
with the head researcher in Boston,

07:55.581 --> 07:58.349
and he says his treatment will
give her an extra 5% chance.

07:58.417 --> 08:00.385
Yes, I read the study, but the...

08:00.453 --> 08:03.321
but the sample population was
only a few hundred patients.

08:03.389 --> 08:05.323
That's really not enough
to tell,

08:05.391 --> 08:07.859
and the side effects, there's heart damage...

08:07.927 --> 08:09.861
That was a woman who was 65 years old

08:09.929 --> 08:12.096
with a history of diabetes and smoked.

08:12.164 --> 08:15.099
Kitty's young and healthy.
Blood clots, it can devastate
her immune system.

08:15.167 --> 08:18.002
Now if the r-chop doesn't work
or... or she has a relapse...

08:18.070 --> 08:20.472
I'm not waiting for a relapse.
And I don't care

08:20.539 --> 08:23.475
what the side effects are as long as she lives.
I just don't think this is

08:23.542 --> 08:25.844
right for her at this time,
and she'd be 3,000 miles away.

08:25.911 --> 08:28.112
Well, I'd go with her, obviously.

08:28.180 --> 08:30.482
Oh, and... and when would
you be there, exactly?

08:30.549 --> 08:33.618
You're running for governor.
Who would take care of Evan?

08:33.686 --> 08:36.453
Her family is here. I am here.
But if the best treatment is there,

08:36.522 --> 08:39.890
then that's where she needs to be.
If I though that were true,

08:39.958 --> 08:41.926
I would be helping her pack right now.

08:41.994 --> 08:44.762
I don't think it's right for her.
Look, she is my wife.

08:44.830 --> 08:47.632
Okay? We're gonna do
whatever's best for both of us.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.568
Oh, no, no. What, are you gonna
play the husband card, Robert?
I don't even know
what that means.

08:50.636 --> 08:53.438
Up until recently, you
have been completely M.I.A.

08:53.506 --> 08:56.808
What, you're gonna swoop in now
and save the day? Is that it?
I just want her well.

08:56.876 --> 08:58.710
Listen to me, Robert. I
don't care if you're senator

08:58.777 --> 09:00.712
or governor or the King of Siam.

09:00.779 --> 09:03.648
You've not shown me that
her life is safe in your hands.

09:03.716 --> 09:06.584
You don't get
to call the shots.
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

09:06.652 --> 09:08.753
But you are right about one thing...

09:08.821 --> 09:11.789
The only person that's gonna be
calling the shots is Kitty.

09:11.857 --> 09:13.424
Yes.

09:13.492 --> 09:16.227
She is.

This is it... gross anatomy.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.769
My name is Professor Madsen,

09:30.836 --> 09:34.039
and I'm here to tell you that
whatever you told yourself,

09:34.106 --> 09:36.608
getting in was not the hard part.

09:36.676 --> 09:41.012
Here, there will be many opportunities to fail...

09:41.080 --> 09:44.182
you're not smart enough,
the work isn't good enough

09:44.250 --> 09:46.718
or you simply can't handle the pressure.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.287
Wow.
Inspirational, isn't he?
There are three people

09:49.355 --> 09:51.756
who will determine your fate in this class...

09:51.824 --> 09:53.191
one of them is me,

09:53.259 --> 09:55.160
yhe other, your cadaver,

09:55.228 --> 09:57.162
and the third is your lab partner.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.431
Now in this class, as in life,

09:59.498 --> 10:03.802
you don't get to choose your coworkers.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.837
You might not like them,

10:05.905 --> 10:09.975
so you have to find a way
to work with them.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.743
Okay?

10:11.811 --> 10:15.013
So the next time we'll begin
with the upper limb.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.715
Be familiar with it.

10:21.220 --> 10:24.356
So I've drawn up a study schedule

10:24.423 --> 10:26.524
for the first half of the year.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.126
Oh, great.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.995
It's, uh, it's color-coded.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.429
By body part.

10:31.497 --> 10:34.065
You've already acquainted
yourself with the upper limb,

10:34.133 --> 10:37.035
right?
Yeah, uh, the, uh, bones
and muscles, I'm good to go.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.037
It's the, uh, tendons and ligaments

10:39.105 --> 10:41.072
I'm a little uneasy... wait, wait. What?

10:41.140 --> 10:44.809
The majority of arm injuries...
lateral epicondylitis,

10:44.877 --> 10:46.811
adhesive capsulitis,
inflammatory impingement...

10:46.879 --> 10:48.546
all are tendon-related.

10:48.614 --> 10:50.515
But we... we weren't supposed to know those

10:50.583 --> 10:52.517
for today, though, right?

10:52.585 --> 10:54.653
No. You see, I volunteered in an orthopedic lab

10:54.720 --> 10:56.955
to help patent a synthetic bone paste.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.924
I mean, you can't expect to know
everything I'm gonna know,

10:59.992 --> 11:02.961
but you will need to keep up with the basics.

11:04.630 --> 11:07.299
I... I'm sorry. How old are you?

11:07.366 --> 11:09.501
16, graduated with honors,

11:09.568 --> 11:11.770
and yes, my social maturity has been tested.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.139
I was gonna mine tested tomorrow.

11:14.206 --> 11:17.142
Look, I have us going over
the musculature of the torso

11:17.209 --> 11:19.778
by early next week.
Is that gonna be a problem?

11:19.845 --> 11:22.314
Uh, no. No, no. I'll, uh, I'll... I'll catch up.

11:22.381 --> 11:24.282
You better, because you heard what he said...

11:24.350 --> 11:25.750
Our fates are tied,

11:25.818 --> 11:29.254
and I will be acing this class.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.324
And no doogie howser jokes.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.693
No.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.097
Oh, my gosh. This is definitely the best one so far.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.534
What... what do you think, Monique?
She looks good in everything.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.604
I don't know about that.
How do you feel about feathers?

11:45.172 --> 11:47.240
Like they belong on birds.
Monique. Yeah.

11:47.307 --> 11:50.543
The symphony gown with the ostrich skirt... I got it.
Are you serious?

11:51.610 --> 11:53.878
Kitty, I can't wear a feathered dress.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.848
I'm gonna feel like big bird. Come on.
You h... you have to at least try it on.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.883
Rebecca, you are the bride.

11:58.951 --> 12:01.419
You have got to embrace your inner princess.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.621
I don't have an inner princess.

12:03.689 --> 12:05.124
You are gonna have to get one.

12:05.192 --> 12:08.326
You are... you are young, and you are beautiful.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.794
Are you drunk?

12:09.862 --> 12:12.063
No. No, I am not drunk. I am...

12:12.131 --> 12:13.598
I'm... excited.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.001
Well, can I remind you that
when you were getting married,

12:16.069 --> 12:19.971
I couldn't get you to even try on one dress?
Well, I was stupid and I was an idiot.

12:20.039 --> 12:23.274
I mean, look at us, Rebecca.
We are surrounded by tulle

12:23.342 --> 12:25.077
and lace and feathers.
I mean, we have to enjoy this.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.546
You never know what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.450
We could all get hit by a bus.
We're not gonna get hit by a bus.

12:29.518 --> 12:30.952
You don't know that.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.654
Things can change in a blink of an eye.

12:39.424 --> 12:40.525
Are you sure you're okay?

12:40.593 --> 12:41.760
Mm-hmm.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.528
I am drinking champagne,

12:43.596 --> 12:46.798
and I am watching my
beautiful future sister-in-law

12:46.866 --> 12:49.901
try on the most gorgeous dresses
I have ever seen in my life.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.903
I mean, I am more than okay.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.339
I'm... I'm great.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.341
I never want to leave.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.743
I mean, I... I love you,

12:58.811 --> 13:02.213
and I... I honestly... I could
stay in this store forever.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.215
Okay, fine.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.284
I will try on the feathers.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.919
Good idea.

13:07.987 --> 13:11.356
Okay, be careful. Be careful.

13:11.424 --> 13:12.859
Okay. Oh.

13:13.227 --> 13:13.961
Hmm.

13:17.029 --> 13:19.464
Our next lot up for bid is 10,000 gallons

13:19.531 --> 13:21.499
of a 2008 Cabernet from Vittarelli Estates.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.435
We'll start the bidding today, $2 a gallon.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.704
Do I have 2$? $2 right here.
Looking for $2.25.

13:26.772 --> 13:30.041
Thank you. $2.25. Do I have
$2.50? $2.50. Looking for $2.75.

13:30.109 --> 13:33.177
$2.75. Do I have $3?
$2.75. Do I have $3?

13:33.245 --> 13:35.480
$2.75 going once, going twice...

13:35.547 --> 13:37.982
$6.

13:38.050 --> 13:42.053
$6. Going once at $6.

13:43.922 --> 13:45.523
$6 going twice...

13:45.591 --> 13:47.892
We can't go that high.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.228
Sold at $6. Up next, we have a 2006 Cabernet...

13:50.295 --> 13:52.563
who is he and what the hell is he doing?

13:52.631 --> 13:54.599
$1.25. Looking for $1.50.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.201
Hey.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.203
I already called the state department,

13:59.271 --> 14:01.739
told them the senator
will be meeting the plane,

14:01.807 --> 14:04.909
so you can save your breath.
No, I'm here about Kitty.
I'm sorry, by the way.

14:04.977 --> 14:08.646
Uh, when are you doing
the press conference?

14:08.714 --> 14:12.316
What are you talking about?
Look, we know.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.586
Uh, we're telling everyone
on the campaign hands off,

14:14.594 --> 14:15.888
leave it alone completely.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.758
And if you give us a day,
we can have the governor cancel

14:17.826 --> 14:21.995
any appearances she has, out of respect.
Out of respect for what?

14:23.062 --> 14:25.963
Look, I'm in this thing to win,

14:26.031 --> 14:30.001
but even I wouldn't use a
wife's cancer to score points.

14:31.870 --> 14:35.506
Are you... Oh.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.708
You didn't know?

14:40.813 --> 14:41.113
It's kev.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.115
Oh, hey. You are not gonna believe

14:43.183 --> 14:45.083
what Travis tried to do to me today.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.085
He tried to tell me that you have...

14:47.153 --> 14:50.956
That you're sick, but I mean, like, really sick.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.826
That's... that's insane, right?
I mean, come on.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.728
Tell me that's insane.
Yeah, he's gonna try to spin this into a reason

14:55.796 --> 14:57.598
that Robert can't run for governor.
Kitty.

14:57.635 --> 14:58.604
You're gonna try to get on top of this.

14:58.605 --> 14:59.605
What?

15:02.606 --> 15:05.106
I'm... I'm sorry. Is... is... is this true?

15:08.507 --> 15:10.208
Oh, God.

15:10.275 --> 15:12.076
Oh, God. Oh, God.

15:12.144 --> 15:13.744
I'm... I'm... I'm...

15:13.812 --> 15:16.347
I... I'm gonna have to figure this out.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.550
Um...

15:19.618 --> 15:21.185
Um...

15:21.253 --> 15:23.621
Uh...

15:25.424 --> 15:27.358
Kit, it's me.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.228
It's your little brother. You can...

15:30.295 --> 15:31.662
Please talk to me.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.197
Yeah, yeah.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.067
Please... Tell me.

15:37.769 --> 15:40.037
Tell me. What... what...
what... what do you have?

15:40.105 --> 15:42.840
Where is it? I mean, how...
how long have you known?

15:42.908 --> 15:44.842
It's lymphoma, and, Kevin, I... I am so sorry

15:44.910 --> 15:47.645
that you had to find out this way.
No, no, no. That's okay.

15:47.713 --> 15:49.081
Oh, God. I'm gonna have
to tell everybody now.

15:49.148 --> 15:51.049
No. No, you don't. You absolutely don't.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.952
Look, I c... I can keep this
a secret as long as you want.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.922
I know you don't think I can. I... I will. I promise.
No. No, you know what?

15:56.990 --> 15:57.957
I think it's actually better

15:58.025 --> 16:00.959
if I just tell everybody at once,

16:01.027 --> 16:02.328
you know, just to... just to get it out there.

16:02.396 --> 16:04.697
Y... y... you know what...
you know what I can do?

16:04.765 --> 16:08.101
Is I can call mom, and I'll...
I'll just have her arrange

16:08.168 --> 16:11.204
one of her... one of her dinners,
but... but it's like...

16:15.641 --> 16:16.909
Kev.

16:17.976 --> 16:18.611
Kev, it's okay.

16:18.679 --> 16:21.713
It's gonna be okay.

16:29.681 --> 16:32.283
Yes, Nora. Of course I'm gonna be there. Yeah.

16:32.351 --> 16:35.720
Uh, I'll leave as soon as I can.
Okay, dear. Bye.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.723
So that guy that just stole
10,000 gallons of wine

16:38.790 --> 16:41.025
right out from under us?

16:41.093 --> 16:43.961
Well, it turns out he was
indicted on felony charges

16:44.029 --> 16:47.231
years ago for price fixing at Voley Foods.

16:47.299 --> 16:50.434
Didn't william work at voley back then?

16:50.502 --> 16:52.937
So what are you getting at?

16:53.004 --> 16:55.940
Come on, Saul. Don't be cagey with me.

16:56.007 --> 16:58.943
This guy just sabotaged

16:59.010 --> 17:01.379
a major component of my business plan.

17:01.446 --> 17:04.482
Right.
He knew William, he's undermining us.

17:04.549 --> 17:08.051
So what are we dealing with
here, hmm? What do you know?

17:08.119 --> 17:10.221
Yes, they worked together at Voley Foods.

17:10.288 --> 17:11.923
They started together,
they shared accounts.

17:11.991 --> 17:12.992
Obviously, they were very good at it

17:13.060 --> 17:14.361
and decided they wanted to be on their own,

17:14.429 --> 17:18.364
and they needed capital.
Let me guess... they stole from the company.

17:18.432 --> 17:19.832
There was an investigation.

17:19.900 --> 17:23.069
Maybe William kept his hands
clean, maybe he saw it coming.

17:23.137 --> 17:25.972
I don't know.
But he ended up testifying,

17:26.039 --> 17:31.308
and Dennis ended up doing five years.
Why does this not surprise me?

17:31.376 --> 17:34.745
That's all I know, and right now
I have to be somewhere.
Where are you going?

17:34.813 --> 17:36.747
I mean, if this is some ancient grudge match,

17:36.815 --> 17:39.617
then we've gotta talk about this.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.051
That can wait. This can't.

17:43.222 --> 17:47.326
Maybe this is about Sarah.

17:49.394 --> 17:51.395
Okay, everyone, here she is.

17:51.463 --> 17:52.897
Hey. Hi, guys.

17:52.964 --> 17:56.400
I'm, um, I'm so sorry to... to keep you waiting.

17:56.468 --> 17:58.769
What's going on?

17:58.837 --> 18:02.907
Oh, no. Are you guys getting a divorce?
No, no.

18:02.974 --> 18:05.509
No, no, no, no.
No, look, I'm so sorry.
I-I have gross anatomy class

18:05.577 --> 18:08.512
tomorrow morning, and my
lab partner has a patent, so...

18:08.580 --> 18:11.382
Well, um, it... it's... it's about me.

18:11.450 --> 18:14.251
Oh, God.
Kevin.

18:14.319 --> 18:16.787
Kevin, are you crying?
Oh, Kevin, don't.

18:19.859 --> 18:22.327
Saul. Saul?

18:22.395 --> 18:25.464
Saul, why are... why are you crying?

18:25.531 --> 18:27.599
I had to tell someone.

18:27.667 --> 18:31.236
Well, somebody better tell us.
I'm starting to panic here.
Uh, yeah.

18:31.304 --> 18:31.305
It's okay. It's... it's... it's...

18:31.372 --> 18:35.874
I... I... I have cancer.

18:36.942 --> 18:38.843
It's, uh, it's lymphoma.

18:38.910 --> 18:42.213
It's in... it's in stage III,
which... which isn't the worst.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.483
Kitty. Um, it just... it just means
that it... it's spread a little bit.

18:45.550 --> 18:49.353
But it's not in her bone marrow.
No, and... and my oncologist is...

18:49.421 --> 18:51.423
is very positive about the prognosis.

18:51.491 --> 18:54.626
It's just a matter now of
deciding what treatment to do.
Chemo or radiation?

18:55.694 --> 18:57.628
Well, R-chop probably, which is chemo.

18:57.696 --> 18:59.597
It's the standard of care.
Well, maybe. I...

18:59.664 --> 19:03.467
She's also been accepted into
a clinical trial in Boston.
I have?

19:03.535 --> 19:06.104
Yeah, I made a call.
Robert, I asked you not to make that call.

19:06.172 --> 19:09.107
You may be going to Boston?
Wh... no. I... I... well, I may...
I don't know. I don't...

19:09.175 --> 19:12.210
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Mom, can you please sit down?
I'm sorry.

19:12.278 --> 19:14.179
I'm... I'm just gonna take some time

19:14.247 --> 19:17.449
and... and, uh, figure out what to do.

19:17.517 --> 19:21.286
Um, but, you know, l... let's just have a normal night.
Yeah.

19:21.354 --> 19:23.655
Right. Yeah. It's gonna be... it's gonna be fine,

19:23.723 --> 19:26.658
and... and mom made
some turkey meat loaf, and...
Yeah.

19:26.726 --> 19:28.994
Come on. Let's... let's all sit down and eat.

19:29.061 --> 19:32.197
Um, Robert, I could, uh,
use your help in the kitchen.

19:36.434 --> 19:38.335
I can't believe you made that call.

19:38.403 --> 19:41.305
I asked you not to start
throwing your weight around.

19:41.373 --> 19:43.807
Hey, I'm gonna keep our options open.

19:43.875 --> 19:46.410
They are Kitty's options to decide.

19:46.478 --> 19:50.314
You just told everybody she was doing r-chop.
I did not. I said probably.

19:50.382 --> 19:53.784
Crap. Nora, look, she wasn't
accepted into this trial

19:53.852 --> 19:56.320
because I made a call. She...
You don't know that.

19:56.388 --> 19:59.857
You would only know that had you not made the call.
She was accepted because they
think it's gonna save her life.

19:59.925 --> 20:01.859
Well, of course they would say that.

20:01.927 --> 20:04.094
They're the ones running the study.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.096
Look, I started a cancer center.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.065
I happen to know the politics of clinical trials.

20:08.133 --> 20:10.401
And I know the politics of this family,

20:10.468 --> 20:12.037
And you don't want her
in Boston

20:12.104 --> 20:14.873
because you want her here with you.
Oh, God, do you think I would jeopardize

20:14.941 --> 20:17.475
the health of my daughter for geography? Jeez!

20:17.543 --> 20:19.644
Don't touch those buns.

20:19.712 --> 20:21.980
So how's the, uh, surrogacy going?

20:22.048 --> 20:24.416
Well, you know...
Coming along.

20:24.483 --> 20:26.618
Mm.
Good.

20:26.686 --> 20:29.654
I've got garlic rolls. A few fell on the ground,
Mmm.

20:29.722 --> 20:32.824
But 10-second rule. They'll be fine. They'll be fine.
Oh, no, thanks. Thanks, mom.

20:32.892 --> 20:35.293
Oh, so you're reading it,
huh? See?

20:35.361 --> 20:37.862
I better go into the kitchen
and see what's going on.

20:37.930 --> 20:40.398
I think she needs some help.
She practically threw up

20:40.466 --> 20:42.767
the lining of her stomach.
Well, that's a hell of a lot better

20:42.835 --> 20:45.770
than what might happen to her
if she decides to be a lab rat.

20:45.838 --> 20:48.139
Guys... rolls.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.141
Stage III... h... how bad is that?

20:51.209 --> 20:55.079
I mean, will she have to be hospitalized?
I know nothing about oncology.

20:55.146 --> 20:57.948
You're a med student. In basic anatomy.

20:58.016 --> 21:00.584
Oh, God. I dragged her dress shopping today.

21:00.652 --> 21:04.088
You know what she kept talking about?

21:04.155 --> 21:07.725
How we could all be hit by a bus tomorrow.

21:09.227 --> 21:12.262
I mean, she was right. We all have been.

21:12.330 --> 21:15.633
Your poor mom.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.301
Oh, my mom.

21:16.369 --> 21:20.171
Look, uh, why don't we go
help her with dinner, okay?
Yeah.

21:23.641 --> 21:26.176
Blood clots in the lungs and heart failure

21:26.244 --> 21:29.813
or nausea and hair loss... pick one.
I... I can't pick one, Nora. It's impossible to...

21:29.881 --> 21:32.483
Pick one, Saul. Pick one.
Saul. Saul. Saul, the study we're talking about

21:32.551 --> 21:35.786
increases her chances of beating this, period.
She can beat it with R-chop without jeopardizing

21:35.854 --> 21:38.188
her health any further. And besides that,

21:38.256 --> 21:40.290
her family is here. Her support system is here.

21:40.358 --> 21:42.793
Right. Right. I agree with Nora on this, Robert.
Of course you do,

21:42.861 --> 21:44.862
because it's always a package deal with you guys...
What?

21:44.929 --> 21:46.798
That's crazy, Robert. Everybody
together, no matter what.

21:46.866 --> 21:47.800
But this isn't Thanksgiving
that we're talking about.

21:47.868 --> 21:50.169
Don't you dare to talk to me
like... don't patronize me.
All right, all right...

21:52.237 --> 21:53.272
I'm not patronizing you. There is an agenda...
I'm not talking about Thanksgiving. We're talking...

21:54.340 --> 21:57.108
You know what I just thought of?
I mean, I... I could cook for you.

21:57.176 --> 21:59.211
I could leave a big cooler outside your door

21:59.279 --> 22:00.547
with fresh meals in it every day,

22:00.615 --> 22:04.317
and you wouldn't have to worry about that.
That's really sweet, Scotty, but you know what?

22:04.385 --> 22:06.320
I'm not gonna be an invalid.
I'm gonna be able to cook.

22:06.388 --> 22:09.991
But I... I have, um, I have
the answer for you guys...

22:11.859 --> 22:15.360
live-in nanny.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
Look, I know you want to talk

22:15.428 --> 22:16.495
about meat loaf and babies,

22:17.563 --> 22:19.298
but I... I can't sit here and
pretend everything's normal.

22:19.366 --> 22:20.467
I'm so sorry.

22:26.338 --> 22:29.807
I'm sorry. I... I feel like I should talk to him.

22:29.874 --> 22:30.842
Yeah, it's okay.

22:31.910 --> 22:34.378
I... I understand. Y... you should go get him.

22:34.446 --> 22:35.114
Okay.

22:37.682 --> 22:40.116
Look, mom's right. That's all
they talk about in rehab,

22:40.184 --> 22:41.619
is your support system.
Kitty doesn't have an addiction.

22:41.687 --> 22:45.822
You know what? Kitty's alone out there.
You know, Robert, if it is such a good treatment,

22:45.890 --> 22:47.024
why is it not the standard of care?
That's right.

22:47.092 --> 22:49.394
And... and tell me, why hasn't
the American cancer association

22:49.462 --> 22:54.264
come out and supported it
or the F.D.A. approved it? Why?
Because the f.D.A. won't update its protocols

22:54.332 --> 22:55.500
and streamline their approvals.
Oh, for goodness sakes.

22:55.568 --> 22:58.170
You have no idea how many drugs
that could save people's lives

22:58.238 --> 23:01.706
are just stuck in bureaucratic red tape.
You don't know which one is which.

23:01.773 --> 23:03.375
But what about A.Z.T.? They
approved that in seven days.
Exactly. Exactly.

23:03.443 --> 23:04.143
After huge political pressure.

23:04.211 --> 23:07.780
No one's marching on capitol hill for lymphoma.
Thank you, Kevin.

23:07.848 --> 23:11.750
She should have the most
aggressive treatment possible.
Kevin, aggressive could kill her.

23:11.818 --> 23:14.653
No, no, cancer could kill her.
Aggressive could kill...

23:14.721 --> 23:15.922
Mom. Mom. Guys.
What? Wh...

23:16.490 --> 23:17.891
Oh, Kitty.

23:21.959 --> 23:22.860
I'm sorry.

23:22.927 --> 23:24.961
I'm... I'm so sorry.

23:24.969 --> 23:28.866
I mean, I know... I know this
was just such a... a... a shock,

23:28.933 --> 23:30.868
but, you know, all this... all this fighting

23:30.935 --> 23:32.836
is... is... is not gonna help me,

23:32.904 --> 23:35.339
and it's... it's not gonna help anything.

23:35.406 --> 23:38.008
You know, I just, um,

23:38.076 --> 23:41.078
I just really wanted to have
a... a normal dinner, you know?

23:41.146 --> 23:44.114
And it was so... it was so crazy of me to think

23:44.182 --> 23:47.050
That we could just eat and
talk and... and be normal,

23:47.118 --> 23:49.119
because, of course, y... you're right.

23:49.187 --> 23:50.854
You're right, Kev.

23:50.922 --> 23:54.024
There's... there's nothing normal about...

23:54.092 --> 23:56.059
Are you all right?

23:56.127 --> 23:57.628
Yeah. Yeah.

23:57.695 --> 24:00.764
I just...
Oh, God. I'm tired.

24:00.832 --> 24:03.700
I'm gonna get your things.
Yeah, I think I... I think I need to...

24:03.768 --> 24:05.736
I need to go home.
And, mom, I'm so sorry.

24:05.804 --> 24:08.739
This was just such a bad idea.

24:08.807 --> 24:10.040
Sorry.

24:10.108 --> 24:15.078
It's okay. I'll see you soon.

24:23.586 --> 24:26.454
Can I say something
that's wildly inappropriate?

24:26.522 --> 24:29.424
If it has anything to do
with death, dying or cancer,

24:29.491 --> 24:31.959
I don't think I can take it.

24:32.027 --> 24:34.228
Actually, it's about the opposite.

24:34.296 --> 24:37.031
Okay.

24:37.099 --> 24:39.200
Let's have a baby.

24:43.772 --> 24:48.042
I warned you it was inappropriate.

24:48.110 --> 24:52.180
I'm touched that you want
to do this for me,

24:52.247 --> 24:55.550
but having a baby, it...

24:55.617 --> 24:57.618
it's just not gonna help.

24:57.686 --> 25:00.154
I'm not trying to help.

25:00.222 --> 25:02.690
You know, ever since
this surrogacy idea came up,

25:02.758 --> 25:04.192
I've been obsessed

25:04.259 --> 25:06.727
with what a huge obligation a baby would be,

25:06.795 --> 25:10.364
and all the precious time I'd lose.

25:10.432 --> 25:13.935
And then tonight...

25:14.002 --> 25:15.837
I don't want to wait

25:15.904 --> 25:20.041
until the "right time" to have a baby.

25:20.109 --> 25:21.909
There is no right time.

25:21.977 --> 25:24.045
But there is a wrong time.

25:25.914 --> 25:28.850
All I can do right now is think about Kitty,

25:28.917 --> 25:33.154
and that wouldn't be fair
to a... to a baby or to you.

25:35.591 --> 25:37.692
Maybe in a couple of months?

25:39.595 --> 25:41.696
Now you sound like me.

25:43.298 --> 25:44.832
I'm sorry.

25:44.900 --> 25:47.268
No.

25:47.336 --> 25:49.203
We'll wait.

25:52.641 --> 25:54.442
I love you.

25:54.510 --> 25:57.545
I love you, too.

26:02.084 --> 26:05.586
Wow. Those textbooks must be really boring.

26:05.654 --> 26:07.588
All right, so what are we gonna go with?

26:07.656 --> 26:10.491
Are you gonna go with, uh,
are you gonna go with strapless

26:10.559 --> 26:11.659
or...

26:11.727 --> 26:14.128
Oh, what's this one called? This one?

26:14.196 --> 26:15.730
Halter.
Halter.

26:15.797 --> 26:18.399
You don't have to do this.

26:18.467 --> 26:22.336
Listen to me.

26:22.404 --> 26:25.573
There is nothing more

26:25.641 --> 26:27.542
that I want in this world

26:27.609 --> 26:30.278
than to walk down that aisle with you,

26:30.345 --> 26:33.314
but the thought of Kitty
forcing herself to celebrate...

26:33.382 --> 26:35.883
She wouldn't be forcing herself.

26:35.951 --> 26:38.853
Then everyone else would be.

26:38.921 --> 26:41.656
Justin, you didn't want to elope

26:41.723 --> 26:43.724
because you wanted our entire families

26:43.792 --> 26:46.961
to be there to celebrate.

26:47.029 --> 26:49.997
But it's not a celebration,

26:50.065 --> 26:52.033
not if Kitty's sick.

26:54.269 --> 26:56.170
I mean, halter or strapless, whatever,

26:56.238 --> 26:58.272
it just...

26:58.340 --> 27:00.575
doesn't feel right, does it?

27:03.345 --> 27:04.545
No.

27:04.613 --> 27:06.747
I know that at our engagement party

27:06.815 --> 27:08.316
I said...

27:08.383 --> 27:10.918
I wanted our wedding to be a priority.

27:12.487 --> 27:15.523
But right now I think that Kitty
should be the priority.

27:17.793 --> 27:20.428
So I was thinkin'...

27:20.495 --> 27:24.498
maybe we should postpone.

27:28.070 --> 27:30.371
Come here.

27:35.077 --> 27:36.844
I would have called,

27:36.912 --> 27:40.147
but I think you would have hung up on me.
Robert, it's late.

27:40.215 --> 27:43.317
I'm not here to argue. I think
we need to get on the same page.

27:43.385 --> 27:46.687
I don't know that we'll ever
be on the same page.
Well, we both love Kitty.

27:46.755 --> 27:50.324
I don't think we'd be fighting
as much if we didn't.

27:53.328 --> 27:54.895
Come in.

27:56.531 --> 27:59.934
Have you talked to, um, Tommy or Sarah?

28:00.002 --> 28:02.536
No. I've left messages for both of them.

28:02.604 --> 28:04.905
I haven't heard back.

28:04.973 --> 28:07.208
But that's not why you're here, Robert.

28:07.276 --> 28:09.510
Kitty's mad.

28:09.578 --> 28:11.979
She's mad at me. She's mad at you.

28:14.383 --> 28:15.516
Yes.

28:15.584 --> 28:18.619
And we've both been
making this about ourselves,

28:18.687 --> 28:19.954
and it's not fair to her.

28:20.022 --> 28:23.758
She needs to know that
we're gonna support her...

28:23.825 --> 28:27.662
whatever decision she makes...
both of us she knows I'll support her.

28:27.729 --> 28:31.132
No. No, she knows you want her here with you.

28:31.199 --> 28:34.135
Well, if she decides to go to
Boston, I'll go with her there.

28:34.202 --> 28:36.404
Well, then tell her.

28:36.471 --> 28:38.939
Nora, she...

28:39.007 --> 28:41.108
She needs you in...

28:41.176 --> 28:43.744
a lot of ways more than she needs me.

28:45.881 --> 28:48.249
Look, you said that you didn't feel

28:48.317 --> 28:51.485
her life was safe in my hands.

28:51.553 --> 28:52.753
Robert...

28:52.821 --> 28:54.455
No, it's okay.

28:54.523 --> 28:58.726
I mean, I know you've been angry.

28:58.794 --> 29:00.194
I've been angry.

29:00.262 --> 29:04.765
I'm angry at everything.

29:04.833 --> 29:07.134
And Kitty and I were just beginning

29:07.202 --> 29:10.171
to try to rebuild our marriage, and now this.

29:10.238 --> 29:13.240
Oh.
Robert, Kitty's right.

29:13.308 --> 29:15.710
You... you can't stop living
just because she's sick,

29:15.777 --> 29:18.679
and you certainly can't stop
working on your relationship.

29:18.747 --> 29:21.882
As a matter of fact, it's a
very good time to start.

29:21.950 --> 29:25.186
What if there's not enough time?
Stop. Don't do that. Kitty's going to be fine.

29:25.253 --> 29:28.889
I'm sorry.

29:28.957 --> 29:31.592
I... I just can't imagine what it would be like

29:31.660 --> 29:34.662
if it were one of my kids.
Well, you would probably fight like hell

29:34.730 --> 29:36.630
with their spouse, too.

29:39.234 --> 29:41.836
I don't want to fight.

29:41.903 --> 29:46.006
Good. Because I think we're
gonna need each other.

29:52.494 --> 29:54.629
The people on these tables
donated themselves

29:54.696 --> 29:56.597
to become a vital part
of your education.

29:56.665 --> 29:59.901
Treat them with the respect
that they deserve.

29:59.968 --> 30:02.470
Yes? Let's begin.

30:05.274 --> 30:08.876
Okay, what's his name?

30:11.547 --> 30:15.550
"Douglas, 47, died of pancreatic cancer."

30:19.221 --> 30:21.355
You want the honors?

30:24.326 --> 30:26.694
You all right?

30:26.762 --> 30:29.530
Um, I'm... a... I'm... a be right back.

30:29.598 --> 30:31.666
Carter, you...

30:33.268 --> 30:35.903
I... I think he actually forgot
his glasses somewhere.

30:35.971 --> 30:38.506
Excuse me.

30:40.776 --> 30:43.044
What, is this your first dead body?

30:43.111 --> 30:46.314
Can you just... can you
just give me a moment, please?

30:46.381 --> 30:49.283
No, I can't. Look, I was
really intimidated by you,

30:49.351 --> 30:51.786
but right now, you're the
one in the fetal position.

30:51.854 --> 30:54.989
Yeah, you're making that
real easy. Thanks.

30:55.057 --> 30:57.024
All right, look...

30:57.092 --> 30:58.960
I know how to do this.

30:59.027 --> 31:01.996
Okay? I've been in war,
and I've seen dead bodies.

31:02.064 --> 31:05.433
And let me tell you something...
patients are a lot scarier.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.869
All right? Douglas in
there... he... he can't cry,

31:07.936 --> 31:10.738
he can't scream in pain, he can't die.

31:10.806 --> 31:15.176
So you're telling me
you're not freaked out at all?
Oh, no, I'm freaked out.

31:15.244 --> 31:17.445
I'm freaked out by the index card in there

31:17.512 --> 31:20.181
that says he died of
pancreatic cancer at age 47.

31:20.249 --> 31:23.718
You see, my sister, who's
a little younger than that,

31:23.785 --> 31:25.853
was just diagnosed with lymphoma, okay?

31:25.921 --> 31:27.355
And I bet that it's

31:27.422 --> 31:29.924
some boy genius like you
who's gonna find a cure.

31:29.992 --> 31:32.493
All right, you're terrified of Douglas?

31:32.561 --> 31:34.528
I'm terrified I'm not gonna learn

31:34.596 --> 31:36.964
what I need to learn
in order to be a doctor.

31:37.032 --> 31:39.667
And I know you know the
tendons like your a-b-c's,

31:39.735 --> 31:43.004
but last night I was busy, so I
didn't get a chance to review.

31:43.071 --> 31:45.006
I need this,

31:45.073 --> 31:47.541
and I'm not gonna let you screw this up.

31:47.609 --> 31:50.611
So let's get in there
and dissect the upper limb.

31:50.679 --> 31:52.747
Come on.

31:55.751 --> 31:57.451
Hey.

31:57.519 --> 31:59.387
Will you do the cutting?

31:59.454 --> 32:02.590
Yeah. You bet.

32:02.658 --> 32:05.993
Here, look. Put these on.

32:06.061 --> 32:07.528
Makes you look older.

32:07.596 --> 32:09.230
Come on.

32:13.602 --> 32:15.870
Um, listen. I've been
going over my research,

32:15.938 --> 32:18.572
and I find that there's some
very compelling arguments

32:18.640 --> 32:21.008
toward doing the clinical trial.

32:21.076 --> 32:23.778
Oh, God, mom. I...
I'm just saying...

32:23.845 --> 32:27.248
Whatever you decide, I... I'm with you,

32:27.316 --> 32:30.618
150%... 500%.

32:30.686 --> 32:32.753
Robert and I both are.

32:32.821 --> 32:35.790
Did he talk to you?

32:35.857 --> 32:38.092
He didn't tell you?

32:38.160 --> 32:41.996
Well, he showed up on my doorstep last night.

32:42.064 --> 32:44.031
He did?
Yes, and, Kitty,

32:44.099 --> 32:46.500
I'm sorry if it seemed like
I was pressuring you.

32:46.568 --> 32:49.437
And, you know, Boston is
really not that far away,

32:49.504 --> 32:50.905
and it's a wonderful city.

32:50.973 --> 32:54.508
There's Quincy market and Newbury Street.
Mom, it's not like

32:54.576 --> 32:57.111
I would exactly be there to sightsee, okay?

32:57.179 --> 33:00.281
No. No, but we could make it work.

33:00.349 --> 33:03.384
I would go with you,
and I could take care of Evan.

33:03.452 --> 33:05.252
And who knows? Maybe we would go sightseeing.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.254
You don't... you don't know how you'd feel.

33:07.322 --> 33:09.924
Everybody responds differently to chemo.
Okay. Fine.

33:09.992 --> 33:11.425
You know what?

33:11.493 --> 33:14.395
Maybe even Rebecca and Justin
can have their honeymoon there.

33:14.463 --> 33:17.164
Um, honey...

33:17.232 --> 33:19.200
I... I think their wedding plans

33:19.267 --> 33:21.202
are kind of in flux right now.

33:21.269 --> 33:22.837
Well, why?

33:22.904 --> 33:24.839
W... w... why? Because of me?

33:24.906 --> 33:29.844
Kitty, everyone needs time
to process their own reaction.

33:29.911 --> 33:31.746
Just... just look at Robert and me.

33:31.813 --> 33:33.681
First we're gonna kill each other,

33:33.749 --> 33:35.750
and then we're having tea together

33:35.817 --> 33:38.619
in the middle of the night,
which we could do in Boston.

33:38.687 --> 33:42.490
We could have our own little Boston tea party.
All right. All right. You know what? Sure.

33:42.557 --> 33:44.158
We'll see. We'll see.

33:44.226 --> 33:47.895
Just... thank you.

33:52.133 --> 33:54.067
You're not going to believe

33:54.135 --> 33:56.303
who wants to meet me for lunch.

33:57.871 --> 33:58.405
Dennis York.

33:58.573 --> 34:01.041
Tell me you hung up on him.

34:01.109 --> 34:02.242
No.

34:02.310 --> 34:05.445
I told him I'd meet him
at McDonnelly's at 1:00.

34:05.513 --> 34:08.782
Better to keep your enemies close.

34:08.850 --> 34:11.018
Good idea.

34:17.725 --> 34:20.427
Saul. I didn't realize you'd be joining us.

34:22.697 --> 34:25.632
Okay. Uh, what are you drinking?

34:25.699 --> 34:28.936
Uh, nothing. Thank you.
I don't have much time.

34:29.003 --> 34:32.406
Holly's not coming?
No, you just get me.
So what do you want?

34:32.473 --> 34:35.409
I want those five years I spent in prison back.
Ah.

34:35.476 --> 34:37.678
But I'll settle for a good investment.

34:37.745 --> 34:39.913
I still know one when I see one.

34:39.981 --> 34:43.516
Yeah, well, even if William
screwed you, he's gone, Dennis.

34:43.585 --> 34:45.619
Yeah, but his company's still alive and kicking.

34:45.687 --> 34:47.855
Where do you think he got
the idea to start one

34:47.922 --> 34:50.925
in the first place?
Are you suggesting
that Ojai was your idea?

34:50.993 --> 34:53.928
I'm not suggesting.
Whatever proprietary claims
you think you have on Ojai

34:53.996 --> 34:58.166
ran out a long time ago.
Then you won't mind a little,
uh, healthy competition?

34:58.167 --> 35:02.503
Keep away from the company...

35:02.571 --> 35:04.806
and stay away from my family?

35:04.873 --> 35:07.008
See you around, Saul.

35:14.582 --> 35:15.782
Hey.

35:15.850 --> 35:17.651
Hey.

35:17.719 --> 35:19.653
What are you doing home?

35:19.721 --> 35:22.889
Uh, I finished my royal duties,
and I took the afternoon off.

35:22.957 --> 35:25.959
Okay, so you went to my mother's
in the middle of the night,

35:26.027 --> 35:28.895
and now you're home in the middle of the day?

35:28.963 --> 35:32.599
Who are you, and what have you
done with my husband?
Let's take Evan to the zoo.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.167
Wow.

35:34.235 --> 35:36.570
Wow. Cancer has done wonders for you.

35:36.638 --> 35:40.107
It's not the cancer. I know you think it is.

35:40.174 --> 35:41.608
I am here

35:41.676 --> 35:44.378
because there's nowhere else I'd rather be.

35:47.315 --> 35:48.949
Okay.

35:52.053 --> 35:53.887
I've made a decision.

35:56.991 --> 35:59.493
I'm gonna do r-chop.

35:59.560 --> 36:01.695
Okay.

36:01.763 --> 36:03.697
I've been looking at these web sites,

36:03.765 --> 36:05.666
I've spoken with a couple of other doctors,

36:05.733 --> 36:08.201
and they all agree that the
prognosis is actually better

36:08.269 --> 36:09.736
in younger patients,

36:09.804 --> 36:12.005
and they all stress the importance

36:12.073 --> 36:14.775
of a support system.
I'm with you.

36:14.842 --> 36:17.678
Well, good. Good.
Because I also think that

36:17.745 --> 36:20.681
we should stay at my mother's
during my treatments.

36:20.748 --> 36:22.849
At your mother's?

36:22.917 --> 36:24.618
Yeah, my... my mother's.

36:24.686 --> 36:26.987
I know. I know. But... but
you're not gonna be able

36:27.055 --> 36:28.989
to have every afternoon off,

36:29.057 --> 36:31.958
and this way we'll know
that Evan is taken care of,

36:32.026 --> 36:34.461
and we'll definitely have our meals.
Okay.

36:34.529 --> 36:37.397
Really?

36:37.465 --> 36:39.833
Are... are... are you sure?

36:39.901 --> 36:42.135
Look, if this is what you want to do,

36:42.203 --> 36:44.838
then this is what we are gonna do, period.

36:44.906 --> 36:48.809
Cancer isn't some magical reset button,

36:48.876 --> 36:50.811
and I just want to make sure

36:50.878 --> 36:56.283
that we're still working on our marriage,

36:56.350 --> 36:58.085
whether you're sick or not.

36:58.152 --> 37:01.254
You know, I remember when
you had your heart attack,

37:01.322 --> 37:03.590
and you didn't let it define you.

37:05.626 --> 37:08.528
I didn't understand it then,
but I understand it now,

37:08.866 --> 37:10.955
and I am not gonna let this define me.

37:12.000 --> 37:18.074

37:19.086 --> 37:20.686
Edwaldo?
Yeah. Yeah.

37:20.754 --> 37:22.155
He's the, you know, he's
the major duomo gorilla

37:22.223 --> 37:25.292
at the zoo, but... but they were
setting up for this wedding,

37:25.360 --> 37:28.061
and they have the most incredible site

37:28.129 --> 37:31.598
right by the lions.
Well, actually, that's, um,
that's why we're here. Um...

37:31.666 --> 37:34.434
Yeah. We were thinking about,
you know, the... the wedding,

37:34.502 --> 37:37.204
and we're just thinking about
postponing it a little bit,

37:37.272 --> 37:39.172
you know, until it's a good time.

37:39.240 --> 37:43.309
Uh, I... you know, look, I know
why you guys are doing this,

37:43.377 --> 37:46.312
and the thing is, is that
it is a really good time.

37:46.380 --> 37:49.149
I... I... I need something to look
forward to. I mean, we all do.

37:48.317 --> 37:50.051
I mean, think about it.

37:50.119 --> 37:52.653
If mom doesn't have flowers
and caterers to obsess over,

37:52.721 --> 37:56.190
she's going to start obsessing about me.
We just want you to be able to enjoy yourself.

37:56.258 --> 37:58.193
Well, why the hell wouldn't I
be able to enjoy it, Rebecca?

37:58.261 --> 38:00.696
Come on. If you guys want
to do something for me,

38:00.764 --> 38:04.165
you won't postpone. You'll have
showers and bachelor parties,

38:04.233 --> 38:06.101
and you'll let me help you register.

38:06.168 --> 38:09.469
And I... I... I j... I just can't think

38:09.537 --> 38:13.539
that life is... is... is gonna stop now.

38:13.607 --> 38:16.275
I mean, does that make any sense?

38:16.343 --> 38:17.577
Yeah. Yeah.

38:17.645 --> 38:20.247
Uh, it's like the, uh, you
know, that camping trip.

38:20.314 --> 38:23.250
Yeah. Remember?
And guess what. I was fine.

38:23.317 --> 38:25.585
Yes, her appendix burst, and it was, like,

38:25.653 --> 38:27.120
Wednesday, you got your appendectomy,

38:27.188 --> 38:30.090
what, Sunday, you were,
like, fine, pitching a tent,

38:30.158 --> 38:32.058
and, you know, spearing fish.

38:32.126 --> 38:36.062
Yeah, right. So no more...
no more, uh, "in flux." Okay?

38:36.130 --> 38:38.965
But this... it's under one condition.

38:39.033 --> 38:42.436
Kitty, I would really love for
you to be my matron of honor.

38:42.503 --> 38:45.405
Oh, R... Rebecca...
No, no, I was gonna ask you anyway.

38:45.473 --> 38:48.408
She was, yeah. I was.
When you asked me to be your bridesmaid,

38:48.476 --> 38:50.377
it made me feel like your sister.

38:50.445 --> 38:52.746
And I don't have a sister, so...

38:52.814 --> 38:54.548
Oh.

38:54.615 --> 38:57.451
Well, yes. I mean, of course.

38:57.518 --> 38:58.919
Yeah?
Yes.

38:58.986 --> 39:01.888
Thank you.
All right. Is the wedding back on?

39:01.956 --> 39:04.825
Uh, yes.
So tell them that this is

39:04.892 --> 39:07.260
the most incredible place to get married.
Where?

39:07.328 --> 39:11.031
The zoo.
Well, Justin will fit right in.

39:11.098 --> 39:14.734
Come on. Let's eat.

39:14.802 --> 39:17.637
Wow. If that's the pizza
guy, I'm joining politics.

39:17.705 --> 39:19.072
Nora.
Mom.

39:19.140 --> 39:21.074
I don't have to stay mom.

39:21.142 --> 39:23.109
I just thought I'd swing by

39:23.177 --> 39:25.412
and bring last night's leftovers.

39:25.480 --> 39:28.982
Oh, pl... please tell me that that
is the turkey meat loaf.
It's the turkey meat loaf

39:29.050 --> 39:31.918
and the mashed potatoes
and creamed spinach.

39:31.986 --> 39:35.489
And I stopped by... I got a cheesecake.
See? That's why we're gonna stay with her.

39:35.556 --> 39:37.457
Wait, Robert, too?
We're like two peas in a pod.

39:37.525 --> 39:40.994
Wait. I... I can't tell. Are they kidding?

39:41.062 --> 39:42.963
No, no, no. They... they've already had, like,

39:43.030 --> 39:45.365
these nighttime tea parties.
Hi.

39:45.433 --> 39:48.368
We were just in your incredibly
remote neighborhood...
Carrying a 4-course meal...

39:48.436 --> 39:50.670
So we thought we'd stop by...
'cause that's how we roll.

39:50.738 --> 39:53.707
Did you rehearse that in the car?
Yeah, a little bit. Hi.

39:53.774 --> 39:56.176
Hi. I can't believe this.
I can't believe you're here.

39:56.244 --> 39:58.778
Wow. Well, thank you.
Whoa! Hold the door!

39:58.846 --> 40:00.881
Saul! Wow. Wow! There's a party.

40:00.948 --> 40:03.817
Oh, I'm so glad I brought a whole case.
Was that you on the road behind us?

40:03.885 --> 40:06.820
Was it me? Who else is gonna
shine their brights on you...

40:06.888 --> 40:09.122
Oh, you guys should have communicated.

40:09.190 --> 40:11.625
You should have carpooled.
Is this too much for you, all of us here?

40:11.692 --> 40:14.361
No, no, this is great.
I'm... I'm... I'm very happy.

40:14.428 --> 40:18.665
Let... let's... let's eat.
Yes, move outside. Come on. Everybody outside.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.543
I hope that our wedding is this easy to cater.
Oh, the best thing

40:29.610 --> 40:32.812
about planning a wedding is all the tastings.
Tastings?

40:32.880 --> 40:35.782
Yes.
My husband's the best chef in town.

40:35.850 --> 40:38.685
Oh, Kevin.
Oh, that's why you came today.
You're auditioning for the job.

40:38.753 --> 40:41.988
Scotty, we would love for you to do it.
Yeah, we just didn't want to assume you'd be...

40:42.056 --> 40:44.824
No, no, no. Assume away. I would love to.
I'm warning you now... he's not cheap.

40:46.127 --> 40:48.428
Okay, where were we?
Another one?

40:57.838 --> 41:00.307
Are you all right?

41:00.374 --> 41:02.409
Oh, yeah.

41:02.476 --> 41:05.579
Yeah. I'm... I'm just... I'm... I'm happy.

41:08.583 --> 41:10.517
No, I'll get it.
Who is that?

41:10.585 --> 41:12.819
I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.

41:17.124 --> 41:19.626
What's with the traffic jam
in your driveway?

41:19.694 --> 41:21.628
Sarah.

41:21.696 --> 41:22.896
Oh, Kitty.

41:22.964 --> 41:26.700
Oh! I'm so happy you're here.
