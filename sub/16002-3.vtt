00:02.041 --> 00:03.792
He won't tell me
who he did it with!

00:03.792 --> 00:05.917
I'm just
gonna miss seeing you.

00:07.750 --> 00:09.959
Mostly what I feel
is just afraid.

00:09.959 --> 00:13.250
Afraid that I'm gonna hurt it,
or be the wrong sort of mother.

00:13.250 --> 00:15.291
You are gonna be
a great mother.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.458
You're my best friend,
always have been.

00:17.458 --> 00:20.709
And you know the rules. Never
let a girl come between us.

00:20.709 --> 00:22.333
I know about you and Marjorie.

00:22.333 --> 00:24.625
You think I wanted
to fall in love with her,

00:24.625 --> 00:26.709
wanted to kiss her?
It just happened!

00:26.709 --> 00:28.625
You guys shouldn't get married.

00:28.625 --> 00:32.291
You can't marry Adam,
because I want you to marry me.

00:32.291 --> 00:34.709
If you love me,
then you need to let me go.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.834

02:19.083 --> 02:22.417
Honestly, I can't believe
all this is about Marjorie.

02:24.667 --> 02:28.792
- These people are her friends.

You saw Adam's face.

Orange, please.

02:37.125 --> 02:39.834
- This is the last orange.
- Should've gone through with it

02:39.834 --> 02:41.417

- Yes.

She didn't want to get married,
save him trouble.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.583
I don't know why she said yes.
She's a coward.

It takes a lot of courage
to do what she did.

02:48.959 --> 02:50.542
No, no, I... Dave's right.

02:50.542 --> 02:53.875
Why go through with it just to
get a divorce two weeks later?

02:53.875 --> 02:57.458
I think, actually, she just
kind of got really overwhelmed.

02:57.458 --> 03:01.250
She saw Brian and then
freaked out and left.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.291

- No one has.

Not a baby person?
Then what's this?

Well, I mean... Well, honey,
of course you're a baby person.

I'm not gonna let
you and Adam screw it up.

12:20.166 --> 12:23.542
Dave? You're my ride!

12:27.458 --> 12:31.500
Mr. Campbell, why was
your accountant giving you
investment advice?

12:31.500 --> 12:34.083
Talked me into this
partnership deal in Arizona.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.542
Son of a bitch cost me
two mil and change.

12:36.542 --> 12:40.000
Mr. Roberts wasn't licensed
as an investment counselor,
was he?

12:40.000 --> 12:43.875
No, he's my...
He was also a friend.

12:43.875 --> 12:46.083
Was he advising you
as your accountant?

12:46.083 --> 12:49.166
Listen, Mr. L.A. Law, I'm not
on trial here. All right?

12:49.166 --> 12:51.500
So just stop grilling me
and do your job.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.291
Unless you wanna try
for a matched set.

12:55.208 --> 13:00.500
- I am doing my job.
- [chuckles]

13:00.500 --> 13:05.458
But if I'm gonna take your
stupid case into open court,

13:05.458 --> 13:07.625
I need more than
a fight between friends.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.291
- Excuse me?
- You've got crap for a case.

13:10.291 --> 13:13.166
The jury's gonna take one look
at your fat ass and say,

13:13.166 --> 13:14.917
"This idiot's not starving,

13:14.917 --> 13:17.458
and he's blaming a friend
for his own mistakes."

13:17.458 --> 13:20.250
Good luck finding a lawyer
dumb enough to take you on.

13:20.250 --> 13:22.917
We all need a moment.
Mr. Campbell, I apologize...

13:22.917 --> 13:25.041
Looks like I found one
dumb enough not to.

13:25.041 --> 13:28.125
Mr. Campbell, I think
if you just sit down again,

13:28.125 --> 13:30.125
I think that we could all...

13:33.041 --> 13:34.875
What the hell
are you doing, man?

13:34.875 --> 13:36.083
He doesn't have a case.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.333
Maybe, maybe not.
But he's the client.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.875
He was pushing my buttons.

13:39.875 --> 13:42.250
I don't care if he
punched you in the face.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.458
We're both trying
to make partner, Adam.

13:44.458 --> 13:47.917
I haven't said anything to you
because it was none of my
business.

13:47.917 --> 13:50.917
You're making it my business
because it's affecting me.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.291
- Your point?
- We both know
what this is about.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.667
You and Brian.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.750
Now, you don't wanna talk to me?
That's fine.

13:58.750 --> 14:02.375
But talk to somebody... before
you ruin both of our careers.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.417
- [doorbell rings]
- Just a minute! I'm coming!

14:09.417 --> 14:11.750
- [Nicole] It's me!
- Thank God you're here.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.125
I have no idea what to wear,
and...

14:14.125 --> 14:17.125
- Hi. Did you read my mind?
- No.

14:17.125 --> 14:20.000
These are just the maternity
clothes that you lent me.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.208
Well, I don't need 'em back.

14:23.208 --> 14:27.417
I'm not gonna have a baby
any time... ever.

14:27.417 --> 14:30.792
I don't need them.

14:30.792 --> 14:35.083
- I'm going for a classic look.
- Classic?

14:35.083 --> 14:37.500
I have the money
to spend on the nice stuff,

14:37.500 --> 14:39.667
so I don't need to
wear things

14:39.667 --> 14:42.000
that you bought at a
garage sale for a dollar.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.500
So you're still mad at me?

14:43.500 --> 14:46.291
I don't need you to tell me
that I should hire a nanny

14:46.291 --> 14:49.333
- because I'm incompetent.
- I never said that.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.333
You implied it.
It was your tone.

14:51.333 --> 14:54.083
It was judgmental
and superior.

14:54.083 --> 14:58.250
If I said something that you
took too personally, I am sorry.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.917
That's the tone
I'm talking about.

14:59.917 --> 15:04.000
You know, can we please, please,
please just go to the concert?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.917
We can argue in the car.
It's what Dave and I do.

15:10.417 --> 15:13.375
You know, this is...
work for me tonight.

15:14.834 --> 15:16.041
Thank you.

with the game...

15:19.208 --> 15:21.291

15:45.375 --> 15:48.208
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am sensitive because...

15:48.208 --> 15:51.125
...I don't know
much about babies.

15:51.125 --> 15:53.375
Every time I hold one,
they start crying.

15:53.375 --> 15:57.834
I mean, it's like they...
can sense my fear.

15:57.834 --> 16:01.625
Well, it's not gonna be that way
with your own baby, I swear.

You'll be amazed.

like I recognized her, you know?

16:09.333 --> 16:15.166
I mean, she had Dave's smile
and she had my eyes and...

16:15.166 --> 16:18.166
- What is it?
- I can't say
anything right with Dave.

16:18.166 --> 16:19.834
I thought things
were better.

16:19.834 --> 16:22.750
We haven't slept
in the same bed in months.

the wedding, it's...

distant, you know? It's like...

16:30.250 --> 16:31.583
I don't understand.

or he's pulling away.

16:42.458 --> 16:43.959
You still love him, right?

16:43.959 --> 16:47.625
If I didn't, would I be crying
at this stupid chick song?

16:50.375 --> 16:52.583
Look.

16:52.583 --> 16:55.083
Your marriage is worth saving.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.458
You've gotta stop talking
and start doing.

16:57.458 --> 17:00.208
- Doing what, though?
- Being there for him.

17:00.208 --> 17:03.041
Being involved in what
he likes and what he's doing.

17:03.041 --> 17:06.375
If it's work that's
absorbing his time, get into it.

17:06.375 --> 17:10.125
If it's something he cares about
it, you gotta care about it.

17:10.125 --> 17:14.333

- Don't tell me. Show him.

37:54.333 --> 37:56.208
I didn't mean tonight.

37:56.208 --> 37:58.875
I mean, if you'd just
stayed away from Marjorie.

37:58.875 --> 38:00.333
I couldn't, Adam.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.041
And I know that's not...
cool,

38:04.041 --> 38:06.291
but if anyone should
understand, it's you.

38:08.667 --> 38:11.875
Besides, I'm sick of everybody
telling me what a wuss I am.

38:11.875 --> 38:14.333
You sure picked
a hell of a time to grow a set!

38:14.333 --> 38:16.041
She left me, too.

38:17.542 --> 38:20.834
If anybody knows what you're
going through now, it's me.

38:20.834 --> 38:22.000
Yeah.

38:23.583 --> 38:25.375
Yeah, I know.

38:30.959 --> 38:32.750
I'm sorry, man.

38:36.417 --> 38:39.375
I'm sorry all this happened.
Really. I...

38:39.375 --> 38:42.083
...don't know
how else to say it.

39:05.375 --> 39:08.542
[laughing]

39:09.166 --> 39:10.750
I don't know.

39:11.834 --> 39:14.417
Maybe we just go
for the crazy girls.

39:14.417 --> 39:16.750
Yeah. Yeah, maybe we do.

39:19.041 --> 39:21.750
Marjorie tell you about
the time I met her mother?

39:21.750 --> 39:25.208
- No.
- Oh, man,
that woman was insane.

39:25.208 --> 39:27.250
I should've known then.

39:28.625 --> 39:32.875
Man, we were driving up
to that... that place,

39:32.875 --> 39:35.083
- the garlic capital of...
- Gilroy.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.417
Gilroy.

39:36.417 --> 39:39.500
On that road
with the Casa de Burger...

39:39.500 --> 39:41.166
- Casa de Fruta...
- Yeah.

39:43.291 --> 39:46.041
Where were we that one time
when it was, like...?

39:46.041 --> 39:47.834
We were driving a big car

39:47.834 --> 39:49.583
and there was
that smell in the car,

39:49.583 --> 39:51.500
and we didn't
know what it was...?

39:53.667 --> 39:56.959
