00:34.534 --> 00:35.869
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:36.369 --> 00:38.038
- Move it.
- Let's get out of here!

00:50.884 --> 00:52.218
Headed down Poplar, toward Main.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.153
- Get 'em off of us, Mick!
- I'm working on it!

01:12.947 --> 01:15.825
- The alley. To your right.
- Okay.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.414
Shit!

01:22.082 --> 01:23.917
Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:24.959 --> 01:25.877
Shit!

01:41.392 --> 01:44.187
Okay. Okay.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.735
- Son of a bitch! We got more!
- Oh, shit!

01:52.570 --> 01:53.571
They're headed down 7th.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.618
Do something, Kali. Do something!

01:58.701 --> 02:01.996
Next right. There's a tunnel. Take it.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.755
We got these bastards now!

02:26.020 --> 02:26.855
Boom.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.691
Holy shit!

02:32.235 --> 02:34.320
Shit! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

02:37.282 --> 02:40.535
What the hell is wrong with you, Adams?
The hell are you doing?

02:40.618 --> 02:43.788
Adams! Come on.
What the hell? Why'd you stop?

02:43.872 --> 02:46.166
Adams! Adams!

02:46.249 --> 02:47.834
Adams, I'm talkin' to you!

02:51.004 --> 02:53.923
Adams! Adams!

04:32.272 --> 04:35.858
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

04:36.734 --> 04:40.488
A police chase rocked downtown Pittsburgh
earlier this evening...

04:40.571 --> 04:44.242
- Another stupid penny!
- Dusty, watch it! You almost hit Mews.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.369
- Can I please check under your cushions?
- Dusty.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.247
Mom, please? It's an emergency!

04:50.832 --> 04:52.917
Who's your buddy? Who's your buddy?

04:55.169 --> 04:56.421
Love you, Mom.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.799
Lucas, you copy? I've got four quarters.
What's your haul?

04:59.882 --> 05:02.802
Take your puny haul
and multiply it by five.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.887
- How?
- While you were scrounging around

05:04.971 --> 05:07.432
like a homeless bum,
I mowed Old Man Humphrey's lawn.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.934
Old Man Humphrey's got that kinda cash?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.894
- Just call Mike already.
- You call Mike.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.939
I have to go take a shower
from doing real work, like a man.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.190
Over and out.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.736
Mike, do you copy? Mike, do you copy?

05:20.570 --> 05:22.113
Yeah. Yeah, I copy.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.490
- What are you doing on this channel?
- Nothing.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.992
Lucas and I have six bucks total.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.453
- What's your haul?
- Shit! I don't know yet.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.539
- What do you mean you don't know yet?
- Hold on. Call Will.

05:41.799 --> 05:43.259
What the hell are you doing?

05:43.801 --> 05:44.677
I'll pay you back!

05:47.346 --> 05:49.265
- Bye!
- Mike!

05:50.016 --> 05:54.103
- Mike! Get back here!
- Hey. No running in the house.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.772
What is going on?

05:55.855 --> 05:58.357
Mike! Mike!

06:02.904 --> 06:04.072
Asshole!

06:25.134 --> 06:27.762
- Hey!
- Okay. So, I'll pick you up in two hours.

06:27.845 --> 06:30.181
- That's 9:00 on the dot, okay?
- Okay.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.058
If anything happens,
if you need to come home,

06:32.141 --> 06:34.352
just ask them to use their phone
and call home. Okay?

06:34.435 --> 06:36.896
- Don't...
- Don't walk or bike home. I know.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.190
- Okay, but, sweetie...
- Mom, I have to go.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.608
Have fun.

06:48.574 --> 06:52.411
To slay the dragon, use the magic sword.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.956
Oh, Jesus!
I'm in unchartered territory here, guys.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.792
- Down! Down! Down!
- I'm going! I'm going!

07:02.964 --> 07:05.049
I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!

07:06.634 --> 07:09.262
Okay. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!

07:11.305 --> 07:13.641
No. No. No!

07:13.724 --> 07:16.811
No! No! No!
I hate this overpriced bullshit!

07:16.894 --> 07:18.980
Son of a bitch! Piece of shit!

07:19.063 --> 07:21.524
You're not nimble enough.
But you'll get there one day.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.610
But until then,
Princess Daphne is still mine.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.197
Whatever. I'm still tops
on Centipede and Dig Dug.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.490
You sure about that?

07:30.867 --> 07:31.951
Sure about what?

07:35.246 --> 07:36.622
You're kidding me. No, no, no.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.834
Move! Move! No, no, no, no, no.
Hey, no! No! No!

07:41.335 --> 07:45.381
- 751,300 points!
- That's impossible.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.884
- Who is Mad Max?
- Better than you.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.970
- Is it you?
- You know I despise Dig Dug.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.930
- Then who is it?
- Yeah, spill it, Keith.

07:53.014 --> 07:57.310
You want information,
then I need something in return.

07:59.937 --> 08:03.357
No, no, no. No way.
You're not getting a date with her.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.026
Mike, come on. Just get him the date.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.861
I'm not prostituting my sister!

08:06.944 --> 08:09.530
- But it's for a good cause.
- No, don't get him the date. Know what?

08:09.614 --> 08:12.450
He's gonna spread his nasty-ass rash
to your whole family.

08:12.533 --> 08:15.953
Acne isn't a rash and it isn't contagious,
you prepubescent wastoid.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.165
Oh, I'm a wastoid?
She wouldn't go on a date with you.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.667
You make, like, what? $2.50 an hour?

08:21.751 --> 08:23.628
- Nice perm.
- Gonna make fun of my hair?

08:27.507 --> 08:30.051
Hey. Hey, guys, do you see the...

09:08.756 --> 09:11.217
Will! Are you okay?

09:15.471 --> 09:17.265
Yeah. I just...

09:18.766 --> 09:21.811
- I needed some air.
- Come on. You're up on Dig Dug.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.021
Let's take that top score back, huh?

09:53.217 --> 09:54.302
Good morning, Jim.

09:55.761 --> 09:59.640
- Jim. Hold on a second. We need to talk.
- Get away from me.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.934
Okay, no... I think you really
wanna hear this.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.229
- Get away from me.
- Trust me. I only want five minutes!

10:05.313 --> 10:08.816
Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek.
We all want things.

10:08.899 --> 10:10.651
This isn't a laughing matter, Jim.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.278
This is serious, okay?

10:12.361 --> 10:14.280
I really got something here.
I'm telling you!

10:14.363 --> 10:15.698
- Hey. Mornin', Chief.
- Morning.

10:15.781 --> 10:16.866
Morning, Murray.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.493
Got any proof
on your butt-probin' aliens yet, Murray?

10:19.577 --> 10:22.913
I believe there was, and may still be,

10:22.997 --> 10:24.832
a Russian spy presence in Hawkins.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.375
Russian spies!

10:26.459 --> 10:32.048
Are the spies in cahoots with the aliens?
Or how do they fit in here? I'm confused.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.925
I'm talking multiple reports now.
Multiple reports, okay?

10:35.009 --> 10:36.510
Of a Russian child in Hawkins.

10:36.594 --> 10:40.681
- A child? What are you talking about?
- A girl who may have psionic abilities.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.183
- "Psionic"?
- Psychic.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.352
What about that girl
that made that kid pee himself?

10:44.435 --> 10:45.311
- A prank.
- What girl?

10:45.394 --> 10:46.687
Wasn't a prank.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.648
You got five minutes. Not a second more.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.734
I talked to a Big Buy ex-employee

10:51.817 --> 10:55.613
who said some little girl
shattered the door with her mind.

10:55.696 --> 10:56.572
I heard that story.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.784
Did you hear the one about the fat man
with the beard who climbs down chimneys?

10:59.867 --> 11:02.370
Then last month,
a co-worker of Ted Wheeler's claims

11:02.453 --> 11:05.915
some Russian girl with a shaved head
was hiding in his basement.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.249
Ted now denies this.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.877
- Oh, wow. That's a surprise.
- But it connects.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.379
- Enlighten me.
- This girl,

11:11.462 --> 11:14.048
she's some kind
of a Russian weapon, right?

11:14.131 --> 11:16.175
Barbara sees this girl,
tries to help her, perhaps.

11:16.258 --> 11:19.136
But before she can,
the Russians find them, take them...

11:19.220 --> 11:23.265
Wait. You're telling me Barbara Holland
was kidnapped by Russian spies.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.893
- Kidnapped. Killed.
- Killed?

11:25.976 --> 11:27.395
- Don't you get it, Jim?
- No.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.523
This has potentially
international implications.

11:30.606 --> 11:34.151
I'm talking a full-on Russian invasion
right here in Hawkins.

11:37.113 --> 11:40.324
Do you have any proof of this girl?
I mean, has anybody seen her recently?

11:40.408 --> 11:41.534
These are separate...

11:41.617 --> 11:42.827
Excuse me. Sorry.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.036
- Okay.
- Hello?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.747
Merrill called,
wants you to check out his pumpkins.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.291
- Says they've been contaminated...
- All right.

11:49.375 --> 11:53.003
By his vengeful neighbor, Eugene.
You're welcome.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.090
I'm sorry. I really hate to do this,
but I gotta run.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.551
- It's an emergency.
- You gave me five minutes.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.262
Yeah, listen, you know what?
I liked your alien theory a lot better.

12:01.345 --> 12:02.930
And you want my advice?

12:03.013 --> 12:06.100
Why don't you stop bleeding
those people dry and go home? All right?

12:06.183 --> 12:09.103
- I am not bleeding anyone... dry.
- Listen to me. Go home.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.739
It's crap, I know.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.367
No, it's not crap.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.413
- It's not good.
- It's going to be.

12:27.496 --> 12:31.250
Just... It needs some reorganizing.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.169
- Can I mark on it?
- Yeah, I guess.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.879
So, in the first paragraph,

12:34.962 --> 12:37.965
you used the basketball game
versus Northern

12:38.048 --> 12:40.676
as a metaphor for your life,
which is great.

12:40.759 --> 12:43.304
But then, around here,

12:43.387 --> 12:46.432
you start talking about your granddad's
experiences in the war.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.728
And I...
I don't see how they're connected.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.229
It connects because...

12:53.063 --> 12:54.648
because, you know, we both won.

12:58.235 --> 13:01.113
- Do you think I should start from scratch?
- No. I mean...

13:02.948 --> 13:03.991
When's the deadline?

13:04.074 --> 13:05.910
It's tomorrow for early application.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.245
Can you come and help me tonight?

13:08.329 --> 13:10.623
We have our dinner tonight, remember?

13:10.706 --> 13:13.167
- Oh, my God!
- We already canceled last week.

13:14.335 --> 13:18.631
- You don't have to go. Just work on this.
- No, no, no. What's the point?

13:19.673 --> 13:21.967
- Hey, calm down.
- I'm calm. I'm calm.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.761
I'm just being honest. You know, I mean...

13:24.970 --> 13:27.389
- I'll end up working for my dad anyway.
- That's not true.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.266
I don't know, Nance.
Is that such a bad thing?

13:29.350 --> 13:33.062
There's insurance and benefits
and all that adult stuff.

13:35.314 --> 13:39.485
And if I took it, you know,
I could be around for your senior year.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.695
- Steve...
- Just to look after you a little bit.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.781
Make sure you don't forget
about this pretty face.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.742
Nance, I'm serious.

13:52.748 --> 13:55.167
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.419
Who is that?

14:38.502 --> 14:40.671
I have no idea.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.132
But would you check out that ass?

14:43.841 --> 14:45.593
Just look at it go.

15:09.491 --> 15:11.201
Meet the human brain.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.621
I know. I know, it doesn't look like much.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.540
A little gross even, right?
But consider this.

15:16.624 --> 15:21.086
There are a hundred billion cells
inside of this miracle of evolution.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.588
All working as one.

15:22.671 --> 15:26.383
No, no, I did not misspeak.
I did not stutter.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.886
A hundred billion.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.139
Ah, this must be our new student.

15:32.222 --> 15:33.599
Indeed. All yours.

15:33.682 --> 15:36.143
All right. Hold up.
You don't get away that easy.

15:36.226 --> 15:37.770
Come on up. Don't be shy.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.897
Dustin, drum roll.

15:41.315 --> 15:45.110
Class, please welcome,
all the way from sunny California,

15:45.194 --> 15:50.115
the latest passenger to join us
on our curiosity voyage, Maxine.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.326
- It's Max.
- Sorry?

15:52.409 --> 15:55.037
Nobody calls me Maxine. It's Max.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.957
- Mad Max.
- Well, all aboard, Max.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.229
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.774
Do you have these in any other colors?
I'm not a big fan of orange.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.234
Hmm...

16:25.317 --> 16:26.527
I'll have to check in back.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.618
Oh, shit!

16:35.744 --> 16:38.122
- You're gonna get me fired.
- That's my master plan.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.833
Get you fired so I can hire you
and we won't have to hide back here.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.963
Bob? Bob, I have to get back to work.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.841
I know. I'm sorry.
I can't stop thinking about you.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.343
- It's crazy. I feel like a teenager.
- Me, too.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.929
You know, in high school,
you didn't know who I was.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.889
Come on.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.851
Bob, I have to get back to work.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.185
Okay.

17:00.269 --> 17:05.607
Go sell your electronic thingamajiggies,
and I'll see you tonight for movie night.

17:05.691 --> 17:06.942
Jonathan's night to pick?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.318
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.329
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

17:20.955 --> 17:22.207
Hey, look, a green one.

17:23.584 --> 17:27.546
Tell Jonathan not to pick anything scary.
I hate scary movies.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.232
You're saying
this was fine yesterday?

17:47.316 --> 17:48.317
Fine?

17:48.400 --> 17:51.278
These were prize winners, Chief.
You should've seen 'em.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.739
For the life of me,
I couldn't figure out what happened.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.033
And then I remembered... Eugene.

17:57.242 --> 17:58.243
What about him?

17:58.327 --> 18:00.913
He's been complaining about me
to just about anyone who'll listen.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.664
Why's that?

18:02.748 --> 18:05.876
Well, he started this
"Pick Your Pumpkin" thing.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.503
Acted like it was trademarked.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.714
I said, "Hire yourself a damn lawyer.
See how far that gets you."

18:10.798 --> 18:13.759
You're telling me that nice old Eugene

18:14.218 --> 18:18.430
came out here after dark
and doused your field with poison?

18:18.514 --> 18:19.640
Not Eugene himself.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.684
- I'm thinking one of his field hands.
- Uh-huh.

18:22.768 --> 18:27.231
Listen, Chief, I don't go throwing around
accusations lightly. You know me.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.609
This happening the day before Halloween,
when sales are peaking?

18:30.692 --> 18:32.194
That's a hell of a coincidence.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.530
Hell of a coincidence.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.075
You got somebody working on that field?

19:23.036 --> 19:24.538
Yeah, screw you, too.

19:25.080 --> 19:28.417
Hey. Be there.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.254
- Hey, Nancy.
- Hey! Thanks.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.715
- Oh, could I get one more?
- Yeah, sure.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.178
You're coming to this.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.097
"Come and get sheet faced."

19:43.265 --> 19:44.474
No, I'm not.

19:44.558 --> 19:49.313
I can't let you sit all alone Halloween.
That's just not acceptable.

19:49.396 --> 19:52.107
Well, you can relax.
I'm not gonna be alone.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.860
I'm going trick-or-treating with Will.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.737
- All night?
- Yeah.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.490
No, no way. You're gonna be home by 8:00,

20:01.200 --> 20:06.997
listening to the Talking Heads
and reading Vonnegut or something.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.624
Sounds like a nice night.

20:08.707 --> 20:13.086
Jonathan, just come. I mean, who knows,
you might even, like, meet someone.

20:15.839 --> 20:20.052
- Oh, my God! Take those stupid things off.
- I missed you.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.471
- It's been like an hour.
- Tell me about it.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.102
Okay. Okay, okay. God.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.521
Sorry.

20:40.030 --> 20:43.951
- There's no way that's Mad Max.
- Yeah. Girls don't play video games.

20:44.034 --> 20:47.537
And even if they did,
you can't get 750,000 points on Dig Dug.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.790
- It's impossible.
- But her name is Max.

20:49.873 --> 20:52.668
- So what?
- So, how many Maxes do you know?

20:52.751 --> 20:54.962
- I don't know.
- Zero. That's how many.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.213
She shows up at school

20:56.296 --> 20:59.174
the day after someone with her same name
breaks our top score.

20:59.258 --> 21:03.136
- I mean, you kidding me?
- Exactly. So she's gotta be Mad Max.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.555
And plus she skateboards,
so she's pretty awesome.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.100
Awesome?
You haven't even spoken a word to her.

21:08.183 --> 21:12.187
I don't have to. I mean, look at her.
Shit, I've lost the target.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.814
Oh! There.

21:30.497 --> 21:32.499
Got it. There we go.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.671
"Stop spying on me, creeps."

21:37.754 --> 21:38.964
Well, shit.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.090
William Byers.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.843
Your mother's here.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.076
You guys think he's okay?

22:08.160 --> 22:10.412
He's always weird
when he has to go in.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.165
I don't know. He's quiet today.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.167
He's always quiet.

22:34.311 --> 22:35.812
You feeling any better?

22:37.481 --> 22:38.315
Will?

22:38.398 --> 22:40.525
Huh?

22:40.609 --> 22:43.070
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.532
Hey. What did we talk about, huh?
You've got to stop it with the sorries.

22:48.116 --> 22:52.287
Sorry. I mean, yeah, I know.

22:53.205 --> 22:58.043
And listen, you know, there's nothing
to be nervous about, you know.

22:58.126 --> 23:01.922
Just tell 'em what you felt last night
and what you saw.

23:02.506 --> 23:07.552
Hey, I'm gonna be there the whole time.
So it's gonna be okay. Okay?

23:09.638 --> 23:10.639
Okay.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.369
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.830
Hey.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.043
Sir Will, how are you?

24:22.127 --> 24:23.837
Mom. Pop.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.548
Let's take a look,
see what's going on here.

24:26.631 --> 24:30.177
I see you shaved off a pound
since we saw you last.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.013
Must be making room
for all that Halloween candy.

24:33.096 --> 24:34.222
What's your favorite candy?

24:34.306 --> 24:36.850
Desert island candy,
if you had to pick one?

24:36.933 --> 24:38.393
- I don't know.
- Come on.

24:38.476 --> 24:40.395
Life or death situation,
what would you pick?

24:40.478 --> 24:42.981
- I guess... Reese's Pieces.
- Reese's Pieces.

24:43.064 --> 24:45.817
Good call. Good call.

24:45.901 --> 24:47.194
I'm more of a Mounds guy,

24:47.277 --> 24:51.490
but I gotta say, peanut butter
and chocolate, come on, hard to beat that.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.408
All right, tell me
what's going on with you.

24:53.491 --> 24:55.160
Tell me about this episode you had.

24:56.745 --> 25:01.666
Well, my friends were there
and then they just weren't,

25:01.750 --> 25:03.418
and I was back there again.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.295
In the Upside Down?

25:06.671 --> 25:08.423
All right, so what happened next?

25:08.506 --> 25:15.013
I heard this noise, and so I went outside,
and it was worse.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.348
How was it worse?

25:17.015 --> 25:18.308
There was this storm.

25:22.270 --> 25:25.023
Okay. So how did you feel
when you saw the storm?

25:25.106 --> 25:26.107
I felt...

25:27.150 --> 25:28.026
frozen.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.324
- Heart racing?
- Just frozen.

25:34.407 --> 25:37.410
Frozen, cold frozen? Frozen to the touch?

25:37.494 --> 25:40.497
No. Like how you feel when you're scared,

25:40.580 --> 25:44.960
and you can't breathe or talk
or do anything.

25:45.043 --> 25:49.047
I felt... felt this evil,
like it was looking at me.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.801
It was evil?

25:52.884 --> 25:56.096
Well...
What do you think the evil wanted?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.430
To kill.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.809
To kill you?

26:01.434 --> 26:02.435
Not me.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.314
Everyone else.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.371
All right,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

26:21.454 --> 26:24.374
It's probably gonna get worse
before it gets better.

26:24.457 --> 26:28.169
Worse? He's already had
two episodes this month.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.797
He'll likely have more
before the month is out.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.592
It's called the Anniversary Effect.
And we've seen this with soldiers.

26:34.676 --> 26:38.096
The anniversary of an event brings back
traumatic memories.

26:38.179 --> 26:40.640
Sort of opens up
the neurological floodgates, so to speak.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.350
So what does this mean for the kid?

26:42.434 --> 26:44.311
He's gonna have more episodes, nightmares?

26:44.394 --> 26:47.314
Yeah, that.
Maybe some personality changes.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.066
He might get irritable. He might lash out.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.568
What do we do when that happens?

26:51.651 --> 26:56.031
Okay. Well, from what we know
about post-traumatic stress...

26:56.114 --> 26:59.909
And we're still learning, okay?
Just treat him normally.

26:59.993 --> 27:03.496
Be patient with him.
Don't pressure him to talk.

27:03.580 --> 27:04.998
Just let him lead the way.

27:05.081 --> 27:08.293
I'm sorry, what you're saying
is it's gonna get worse and worse

27:08.376 --> 27:10.587
and we're just supposed to pretend
it's not happening?

27:10.670 --> 27:12.339
It sounds counterintuitive, I know.

27:12.422 --> 27:15.800
But I assure you that is really
the best thing you can do for him.

27:19.888 --> 27:23.600
Listen. I understand what you went through
last year. I get it.

27:23.683 --> 27:27.312
But those people are gone.
They're gone. Okay?

27:27.937 --> 27:29.522
So if we're gonna get through this,

27:30.398 --> 27:33.818
I just... I need you to realize
I'm on your side.

27:36.237 --> 27:37.614
I need you to trust me.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.242
"Trust me"?

27:41.326 --> 27:43.328
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah, I know.

27:43.411 --> 27:47.165
But, you know, university gives out
a degree, this guy's got it.

27:47.248 --> 27:51.252
And look, that post-traumatic stuff
he's talking about, that stuff is real.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.839
He's gonna be okay. All right?

27:56.299 --> 27:58.134
How's Bob the Brain?

27:58.968 --> 28:00.303
Don't call him that.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.888
Sorry. Old habit.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.516
He's good. We're good.

28:04.599 --> 28:06.684
Good. I'm happy for you.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.853
Really. Hey...

28:09.521 --> 28:11.856
Things get worse, you call me first.

28:13.441 --> 28:14.442
You call me.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.069
Okay.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.176
They're ready for you, sir.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.193
- Patty.
- Sam.

28:58.653 --> 28:59.612
Afternoon, sir.

28:59.696 --> 29:03.074
- Looks like another hot one today, huh?
- Never gets old, sir.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.040
Still no sign?

29:52.123 --> 29:53.166
Jack shit.

29:53.249 --> 29:58.379
- Oh! Damn it. My mom's gonna murder me.
- So go home. I'll radio if she comes.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.674
Oh, yeah, nice try. You just want me
out of here so you can make your move.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.676
- Oh, 'cause you're such a threat.
- That's right.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.221
She will not be able to resist
these pearls.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.850
- Ten o'clock. Ten o'clock.
- What?

30:18.775 --> 30:20.652
- They're arguing. They're arguing.
- Oh, my God.

30:20.735 --> 30:23.029
I see that. I don't even know
why you need those.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.489
God. You're so stupid.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.423
She's incredible.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.510
She's...

30:46.344 --> 30:47.679
Mad Max.

30:51.891 --> 30:55.311
After dinner, I want you to pick out
your toys for the yard sale.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.146
- Fine.
- Two boxes' worth.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.023
- Two boxes?
- You heard me.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.900
I'm fine with you giving away a couple,

31:00.984 --> 31:03.069
but the other ones have
way too much emotional value.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.738
- Emotional value?
- They're hunks of plastic, Michael.

31:05.822 --> 31:07.073
You already took away my Atari.

31:07.156 --> 31:09.701
Didn't wanna lose more toys,
you shouldn't have stolen from Nancy.

31:09.784 --> 31:11.244
I didn't steal. I borrowed.

31:11.327 --> 31:13.913
Oh, and you didn't curse out Mr. Kowalski
last week either, right?

31:13.997 --> 31:16.541
Or plagiarize that essay?
Or graffiti the bathroom stall?

31:16.624 --> 31:18.334
Everyone graffitis the bathroom stall.

31:18.418 --> 31:22.005
So if your friend jumps off a cliff,
you're gonna jump, too?

31:22.088 --> 31:25.884
We know you've had a hard year, Michael.
But we've been patient.

31:25.967 --> 31:28.678
This isn't strike one.
This isn't even strike three.

31:28.761 --> 31:31.306
It's strike 20. You're on the bench, son.

31:31.389 --> 31:35.143
And if it'd been my coach,
you'd be lucky to still be on the team.

31:35.226 --> 31:38.313
Two boxes. Two.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.363
Okay. Ready?

31:48.281 --> 31:49.407
Yeah.

31:50.658 --> 31:52.201
Okay.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.668
I'm so sorry
I didn't get to cook.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.671
I was gonna make that baked ziti
you guys like so much,

32:03.755 --> 32:06.049
but I just forgot about the time,
and before you know it,

32:06.132 --> 32:07.717
"Oh, my God, it's five o'clock."

32:07.800 --> 32:10.762
- It's fine. It's great.
- Right. I love KFC.

32:12.388 --> 32:16.601
So, I noticed a "For Sale" sign
out in your yard.

32:16.684 --> 32:19.228
Is that the neighbors', or...

32:19.312 --> 32:21.814
- You wanna tell them?
- Go ahead.

32:24.233 --> 32:27.946
We hired a man named Murray Bauman.
Have either of you heard of him?

32:29.155 --> 32:31.199
- No.
- No, I don't think so.

32:31.282 --> 32:34.827
He was an investigative journalist
for the Chicago Sun-Times.

32:34.911 --> 32:36.204
He's pretty well known.

32:36.287 --> 32:40.833
Anyway, he's freelance now,
and he agreed to take the case.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.878
That's... That's great.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.881
No, that's really... That's great, right?

32:46.965 --> 32:50.426
Um, what exactly does that mean?

32:50.510 --> 32:53.471
Means he's gonna do
what that lazy son of a bitch Jim Hop...

32:55.807 --> 32:56.808
Sorry.

32:59.018 --> 33:01.521
What the Hawkins police haven't been
capable of doing.

33:02.313 --> 33:05.483
Means we have a real detective
on the case.

33:05.566 --> 33:06.567
It means...

33:07.777 --> 33:09.445
we're going to find our Barb.

33:10.071 --> 33:13.116
If anyone can find her, it's this man.

33:14.158 --> 33:18.621
He already has leads.
By God, he's worth every last penny.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.958
Is that why you're selling the house?

33:22.041 --> 33:24.460
Don't worry about us, sweetie. We're fine.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.337
More than fine.

33:26.421 --> 33:30.258
For the first time in a long time,
we're hopeful.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.347
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

33:46.649 --> 33:49.027
- It's finger-lickin' good.
- Mmm.

35:16.697 --> 35:19.325
El, are you there? El?

35:22.537 --> 35:24.872
It's me. It's Mike.

35:25.623 --> 35:29.627
It's day 352, 7:40 p. m.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.213
I'm still here.

35:36.759 --> 35:39.637
If you're out there, say something.
Or give me a sign.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.474
I won't even say anything.
Just... I wanna know if you're okay.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.647
I'm so stupid.

35:52.567 --> 35:53.568
Mike.

35:55.611 --> 35:58.030
- Mike?
- Hello, is that you?

35:58.114 --> 36:01.200
Yeah, it's me, Dustin.
What're you doing on this channel again?

36:01.284 --> 36:04.704
I've been trying to reach you all day.
We were right. Max is Mad Max.

36:04.787 --> 36:06.247
- Yeah, I'm busy.
- But...

36:08.624 --> 36:10.793
- What do we do now?
- We stick to the plan.

36:10.877 --> 36:11.878
Mike's not gonna like it.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.088
Last time I checked,
our party is not a dictatorship.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.215
- It's a democracy.
- What if Max says no?

36:16.299 --> 36:19.093
How can Max say no to these?

36:19.177 --> 36:20.720
I told you to stop that.

36:20.803 --> 36:22.430
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Later.

36:41.490 --> 36:42.366
Mews!

36:48.581 --> 36:49.582
Mews.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.682
- Stop. Stop!
- What?

37:06.766 --> 37:09.060
Come on, you gotta get used to it.
This is the future.

37:09.143 --> 37:11.145
Well, put the future down
and get me a clean bowl.

37:18.027 --> 37:22.573
Hey, bud. I didn't know
what you'd like, so I got a variety.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.660
- Take your pick.
- Whatever you want.

37:26.911 --> 37:27.787
All right.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.540
What are you working on?

37:33.042 --> 37:36.128
Zombie Boy? Who's Zombie Boy?

37:37.755 --> 37:40.508
- Me.
- Did someone call you that?

37:41.717 --> 37:45.763
Hey. You can talk to me.
You know that, right?

37:45.846 --> 37:48.599
Whatever happened.
Will, come on, talk to me.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.643
- Stop treating me like that.
- What? Like what?

37:50.726 --> 37:53.104
Like everyone else.
Like there's something wrong with me.

37:53.187 --> 37:54.939
What are you talking about?

37:55.022 --> 37:57.275
Mom, Dustin, Lucas. Everyone.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.402
They all treat me like I'm gonna break.

37:59.485 --> 38:02.071
Like I'm a baby.
Like I can't handle things on my own.

38:03.197 --> 38:06.409
It doesn't help. It just makes me feel
like more of a freak.

38:06.492 --> 38:09.662
- You're not a freak.
- Yeah, I am.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.580
I am.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.586
You know what? You're right.

38:19.213 --> 38:20.506
You are a freak.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.801
- What?
- No, I'm serious. You're a freak.

38:23.884 --> 38:28.514
But what? Do you wanna be normal?
Do you wanna be just like everyone else?

38:28.597 --> 38:30.725
Being a freak is the best. I'm a freak.

38:30.808 --> 38:33.019
Is that why you don't have any friends?

38:33.644 --> 38:36.230
I have friends, Will.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.441
Then why are you
always hanging out with me?

38:39.734 --> 38:42.111
Because you're my best friend, all right?

38:42.194 --> 38:46.282
And I would rather be best friends
with Zombie Boy than with a boring nobody.

38:46.365 --> 38:47.700
You know what I mean?

38:48.409 --> 38:49.910
Okay, look...

38:50.828 --> 38:54.415
Who would you rather be friends with?
Bowie or Kenny Rogers?

38:54.498 --> 38:55.708
Ugh.

38:55.791 --> 38:57.960
Exactly. It's no contest.

38:58.669 --> 39:01.213
The thing is, nobody normal

39:01.297 --> 39:03.758
ever accomplished anything meaningful
in this world.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.427
- You got it?
- Well...

39:07.303 --> 39:10.014
- some people like Kenny Rogers.
- Kenny Rogers.

39:10.097 --> 39:12.725
I love Kenny Rogers.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.311
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

39:16.062 --> 39:19.482
Mr. Mom. Perfect!

39:24.862 --> 39:26.530
Where's Mommy keep the extra diapers?

39:31.660 --> 39:34.205
Hey! Cowards.

39:42.630 --> 39:43.631
Hey.

39:44.757 --> 39:47.259
It's okay. Let it go.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.719
Probably just a crank call.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.806
- Okay.
- Holy mackerel!

39:51.889 --> 39:53.933
- Let it go.
- Aw, man!

43:55.591 --> 43:58.385
Hey, what'd we talk about?

44:00.471 --> 44:01.639
No signal.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.935
- What?
- No signal.

44:07.019 --> 44:09.313
It's 8-1-5. You're late.

44:10.564 --> 44:13.901
Yeah, I lost track of time.
I'll signal next time, all right?

44:14.068 --> 44:18.781
Uh, and it's 8:15. It's not 8-1-5.

44:21.325 --> 44:22.951
Eight-fifteen.

44:23.535 --> 44:24.828
Now, what did we talk about?

44:26.538 --> 44:29.958
Dinner first, then dessert. Always.

44:30.668 --> 44:31.960
That's a rule.

44:33.962 --> 44:34.963
Yeah?

44:36.423 --> 44:37.424
Yes.
