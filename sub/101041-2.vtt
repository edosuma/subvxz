10:28.294 --> 10:30.696
I thought Penn and Teller
knew every trick in the book,

10:30.730 --> 10:32.999
but looks like
they skipped a page.

10:33.032 --> 10:35.001
We'll let them
study up during the break.

10:35.034 --> 10:36.769
Stay close.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.605
[cheers and applause]

10:44.644 --> 10:46.846
[jazz music]

10:46.879 --> 10:49.582
[cheers and applause]

10:49.615 --> 10:50.916
- Welcome back.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.385
If you're just joining us,

10:52.418 --> 10:54.887
you missed Penn and Teller
getting fooled.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.590
Maybe you can see it
happen again with our next act.

11:00.226 --> 11:02.028
- I started doing magic
to get girls.

11:02.061 --> 11:06.699
As a teenager,
I was bedeviled by insecurity,

11:06.732 --> 11:10.302
and I wondered what would make
the opposite sex admire me.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.672
Then a friend of mine
made a toothpick disappear,

11:12.705 --> 11:15.341
and it totally freaked me out.

11:15.374 --> 11:17.543
He showed me the method,
and it seemed doable.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.679
Playing around
with illusions changed me.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.213
To perform takes confidence,

11:21.247 --> 11:23.049
so I had to find
some inside me.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.483
I tried out for "Fool Us"

11:24.517 --> 11:26.419
because I met
a famous magician,

11:26.452 --> 11:29.855
and he told me that I wasn't
good enough to be on the show.

11:29.889 --> 11:31.424
So I worked hard

11:31.457 --> 11:34.860
on an original illusion,
and, amazingly...

11:34.894 --> 11:36.429
I'm here.

11:36.462 --> 11:38.230
I'm still
terribly afraid at times.

11:38.264 --> 11:41.667
I constantly move
between joy and self-doubt.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.035
Which will win out?

11:43.069 --> 11:44.704
[chuckles]
I guess we're about to see.

11:44.737 --> 11:47.606
Tonight on "Fool Us," I will
hurl myself into the abyss,

11:47.640 --> 11:50.076
and hopefully my magic
will catch me.

11:50.109 --> 11:52.011
[applause]

11:52.044 --> 11:55.381
- Here with a randomly
pre-selected host of the show

11:55.414 --> 11:57.717
is Dev Sherman!

11:57.750 --> 12:00.553
[cheers and applause]

12:03.022 --> 12:06.859
- I feel like
I'm standing in a dream...

12:06.892 --> 12:09.562
an absolutely incredible dream.

12:09.595 --> 12:11.864
I can't believe that
I get to show a magic trick

12:11.897 --> 12:14.667
in front of two of the greatest
magicians alive.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.469
I can't--I can't believe it.

12:16.502 --> 12:17.970
- Aw.
- [laughs]

12:18.003 --> 12:21.841
[cheers and applause]

12:21.874 --> 12:23.476
I never thought
that I was actually good enough

12:23.509 --> 12:25.044
to be here.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.046
Never.
[dramatic tone]

12:27.079 --> 12:29.482
- That's because
you're not good enough.

12:29.515 --> 12:32.084
You're just an average,
ordinary magician.

12:32.118 --> 12:33.385
Look at your suit.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.056
There's a stain
on your pocket square.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.324
- [sighs]
Sorry about that.

12:38.357 --> 12:42.528
That's the voice
of my inner critic.

12:42.561 --> 12:46.198
Um, he gets really
annoying and loud,

12:46.232 --> 12:47.867
especially when
I'm about to do magic, right?

12:47.900 --> 12:50.102
And sometimes--
Hold on.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.704
If I just...

12:51.737 --> 12:54.106
do that.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.674
No more stain.
- Ahh.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.277
- Thank you.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.880
Yeah, sometimes
I can't keep him quiet.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.515
So what I do is I draw.

13:02.548 --> 13:03.849
- Oh.
- I draw symbols

13:03.883 --> 13:06.786
that have a magical effect
on me, right?

13:06.819 --> 13:09.121
First I draw waves.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.658
Let me show you.
Let me show you what I draw.

13:12.691 --> 13:13.959
First, I draw waves.
Can you see that?

13:13.993 --> 13:15.961
Yeah, perfect.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.396
[exhales sharply]

13:17.429 --> 13:19.865
Waves because they remind me
to breathe, right?

13:19.899 --> 13:21.634
Like, they rise and fall.
They remind me to breathe in...

13:21.667 --> 13:23.569
[inhales deeply]

13:23.602 --> 13:27.306
- [breathing deeply]

13:27.339 --> 13:28.407
- And breathe out.
[exhales deeply]

13:28.440 --> 13:30.810
- Oh.
- [laughs]

13:30.843 --> 13:32.478
That's fine.
- Okay.

13:32.511 --> 13:33.913
- It calms me down, right?

13:33.946 --> 13:37.249
And then we draw a fish hook.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.551
[exhales sharply]
Fish hook.

13:38.584 --> 13:39.752
- Oh.
- A fish hook

13:39.785 --> 13:42.188
signifies strength
and determination.

13:42.221 --> 13:43.489
So every time I draw it,

13:43.522 --> 13:45.925
I feel stronger
and more determined.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.693
- Okay.
- And then finally

13:47.726 --> 13:51.831
I draw the lotus.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.265
The lotus...
[exhales sharply]

13:53.299 --> 13:55.201
Signifies purity.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.203
[exhales sharply]
Purity because it grows

13:57.236 --> 14:00.406
in these dark, dirty,
muddy conditions,

14:00.439 --> 14:02.341
but it blooms
into this beautiful flower.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.043
So it makes me feel like,

14:04.076 --> 14:07.780
even though my inner critic
is clearly not very nice to me,

14:07.813 --> 14:10.049
I can still do
beautiful magic...

14:10.082 --> 14:11.517
like this.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.954
So we have one,
two, three, four cards,

14:14.987 --> 14:17.323
and one of them
has symbols on them.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.159
But if I wave...

14:21.493 --> 14:24.129
This printed to two cards.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.633
If I wave again...

14:27.666 --> 14:30.369
now they're on three.

14:30.402 --> 14:32.304
And one more time...

14:32.338 --> 14:34.874
One, two, three, four.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.508
Every card.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.843
One, two, three--
[dramatic tone]

14:37.877 --> 14:40.546
- That's not beautiful magic.

14:40.579 --> 14:43.115
It's only four cards.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.219
- Let's do more, then.
Let's do more.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.355
Why not, right?
If not four, then more.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.224
Right, all it takes,
all I have to do...

14:52.258 --> 14:56.662
is spread,
take one of these,

14:56.695 --> 14:58.697
do a fancy thing,

14:58.731 --> 15:01.133
and wave.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.269
Do you want to wave as well?
- Hey.

15:03.302 --> 15:04.470
- Very magical.
- Nice.

15:04.503 --> 15:05.604
- Good job.
[laughs]

15:05.638 --> 15:07.606
All right, everybody,
breathe in.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.175
[inhales deeply]

15:10.209 --> 15:12.378
[exhales deeply]

15:12.411 --> 15:14.313
- Wow!

15:14.346 --> 15:17.149
[cheers and applause]

15:20.519 --> 15:21.820
- Let's try--
let's try one more thing.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.889
Can you make a cup
with your hands?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.124
All right, see,
if I give the symbols--

15:25.157 --> 15:26.225
It doesn't work every time,

15:26.258 --> 15:29.028
but if I give
the symbols a rub...

15:29.061 --> 15:32.464
they come off.

15:32.498 --> 15:34.466
Give them a shake.
Shake them in your hands.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.668
Shake them.
Yeah, nice.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.036
Good shaking.
Well done.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.971
All right, so you've got
the symbols in your hand,

15:39.004 --> 15:41.540
and I have a few more cards
without any symbols on them.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.809
Right? Have a look
and just name any one of these.

15:43.842 --> 15:46.245
- Uh, five of diamonds.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.546
- Five of diamonds?
Perfect, all right.

15:47.579 --> 15:49.248
Think about the fish hook.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.050
With strength
and determination,

15:51.083 --> 15:53.085
throw the symbols
onto the five of diamonds.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.653
One, two, three.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.022
[magical whoosh]

15:57.056 --> 15:59.725
[exhales sharply]

15:59.758 --> 16:02.828
Only one card.

16:02.861 --> 16:05.197
Only one card
has the symbols on them.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.966
And you named a specific card.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.200
What was it,
the five of diamonds?

16:08.233 --> 16:09.835
- Mm-hmm.
- And you just named it, right?

16:09.868 --> 16:11.203
- Just named it.
- Yeah.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.172
- Yeah.
- The five of--

16:14.573 --> 16:17.443
[dramatic tone]
- I told you.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.145
I told you
you couldn't do it.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.115
You don't belong here.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.652
- [panting]

16:26.685 --> 16:27.886
[sighs]

16:27.920 --> 16:30.522
Five of diamonds?

16:30.556 --> 16:32.024
Five of diamonds.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.726
- Wow.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.861
[cheers and applause]

16:35.894 --> 16:40.232
Dev Sherman,
ladies and gentlemen!

16:40.265 --> 16:42.167
Wow.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.036
Aw. I don't think
you should ever listen

16:44.069 --> 16:45.304
to that voice again.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.872
- Okay, thank you.
- I was really touched

16:46.905 --> 16:49.208
by how excited you are

16:49.241 --> 16:50.843
to perform
in front of Penn and Teller.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.679
- Yeah, I didn't ever imagine
I'd be here.

16:53.712 --> 16:56.081
My God, I can't believe it,
so--I still can't believe it.

16:56.115 --> 16:58.484
[both laughing]

16:58.517 --> 17:00.686
- So what is your favorite
performance ever,

17:00.719 --> 17:01.520
besides this one?

17:01.553 --> 17:02.788
- Oh, okay.

17:02.821 --> 17:04.522
So, when I was in university,

17:04.556 --> 17:07.626
I went to Nepal
with a bunch of other students,

17:07.659 --> 17:09.028
and I started showing magic

17:09.060 --> 17:11.964
to, like, a few kids
over there, and they loved it.

17:11.997 --> 17:13.665
And I couldn't speak
a word of theirs,

17:13.699 --> 17:16.035
and they couldn't speak, like,
a word of mine--of my language.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.470
And yet everyone loved it.
Everyone reacted.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.271
It was a really
special performance.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.441
- Oh, I can only imagine.
- Yeah.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.777
- All right, it's time
to find out if Penn and Teller

17:24.810 --> 17:27.311
know how you did your trick.
- All right, great.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.614
- Hey, Dev.
- Hi.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.449
- Boy, really nice.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.217
You did that thing
we love in magic

17:32.251 --> 17:36.288
where you do three sections
that look like

17:36.321 --> 17:39.458
they're the same subject,
same plot, same ideas,

17:39.491 --> 17:41.193
but totally different methods,

17:41.226 --> 17:43.028
and that's always
a really good way to fool.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.464
- Yeah.
- And there's a--

17:45.497 --> 17:47.199
I think you are familiar

17:47.232 --> 17:50.369
with our good friends
Count Elmsley--

17:50.402 --> 17:51.570
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
- I think you've heard of him.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.906
And Señor Asconio,
I think you've also--

17:53.939 --> 17:55.374
- Yeah, I know him as well.

17:55.407 --> 17:56.742
- You probably--
two of our friends

17:56.775 --> 17:58.577
you've bumped into
now and again.

17:58.610 --> 18:02.481
- Lovely people.
- And there was a symmetry

18:02.514 --> 18:04.450
to your act and the way
things were laid out

18:04.483 --> 18:07.419
that was really beautiful,
the way it comes back in,

18:07.453 --> 18:11.290
and the idea of the inner
critic was very good.

18:11.323 --> 18:13.492
You're very rough on yourself
with the inner critic.

18:13.525 --> 18:14.760
- [laughs]
- But then it was

18:14.793 --> 18:16.428
a smooth performance
all the way through.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.797
- Cool, thank you.
- Really, really, really nice

18:18.831 --> 18:20.299
and a really nice idea.

18:20.332 --> 18:21.967
And we hope in all of that

18:22.000 --> 18:24.036
that we gave you enough
slid in there.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.270
I don't want to give away--
- Oh, yeah, totally.

18:25.304 --> 18:26.672
- Oh, good, good, good.
- Absolutely.

18:26.705 --> 18:28.674
- So you didn't fool them.
- Nah, I didn't fool them.

18:28.707 --> 18:31.477
- Oh, well, thank you so much.
Dev Sherman!

18:31.510 --> 18:33.011
- Thank you.

18:33.045 --> 18:36.849
[cheers and applause]

18:36.882 --> 18:40.185
- Up next, Penn and Teller
take on more magic tricks.

18:40.219 --> 18:43.222
And later, Penn and Teller
perform one of their very own.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.490
Stick around.

18:44.523 --> 18:47.326
[applause]

18:52.364 --> 18:54.399
[jazz music]

18:54.433 --> 18:57.236
[cheers and applause]

18:57.269 --> 18:58.704
- Welcome back.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.839
It's time
for another amazing magician.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.040
Take a look.

19:28.367 --> 19:29.568
[laughs]

19:51.089 --> 19:55.794
[cheers and applause]

19:55.827 --> 19:58.897
Please welcome Conan Liu!

19:58.931 --> 20:02.000
[cheers and applause]

20:03.202 --> 20:04.469
- Hello, guys.

20:04.503 --> 20:07.339
My name is Conan Liu,
and I'm from China.

20:07.372 --> 20:09.508
Growing up,
my dad always tells me,

20:09.541 --> 20:12.177
"A cup of tea a day
keeps the doctor away."

20:12.211 --> 20:15.380
China's tea
is very good for health

20:15.414 --> 20:19.718
because it's originated
from the natural tea leaves.

20:19.751 --> 20:22.054
But modern people
will also mix in...

20:22.087 --> 20:23.488
a tea bag,

20:23.522 --> 20:25.357
which is convenient
and portable.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.758
Alyson,
do you want to check it out?

20:26.792 --> 20:28.327
- Sure.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Alyson!

20:28.360 --> 20:29.728
- Oh, thanks.

of those situations

a gimmick teapot.

something with the teapot,

was completely innocent.

as little as possible,

the East Indian trick

magicians in history--

31:53.211 --> 31:54.946

- Aw.

32:00.151 --> 32:01.486
- Swallowed the needles.

32:01.519 --> 32:04.455
But fish hooks
is a really good idea.

32:04.489 --> 32:08.159

that you did.

[laughs]

32:12.263 --> 32:15.133
It really--
the way the geometry works

32:15.166 --> 32:17.502
makes it much more deceptive
with fish hooks,

32:17.535 --> 32:19.337
not more deceptive than you,
of course.

32:19.370 --> 32:20.738
I wouldn't say that,

32:20.772 --> 32:23.408
but more deceptive than other
people doing the needles.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.475
That was great.

32:24.509 --> 32:28.313
So we know
how the needles is done,

32:28.346 --> 32:31.082
and we can map that
onto the fish hooks.

32:31.115 --> 32:32.483
Now, this is part of this thing

32:32.517 --> 32:35.186

gets rather esoteric

is not what everybody else

swallowing the thread

32:55.640 --> 32:57.675

32:57.709 --> 33:01.045
There's a part there with
the thread that does not fit

33:01.079 --> 33:03.715
in the way that we knew
this is done normally.

33:03.748 --> 33:05.817
That was the part
that blew our minds.

33:05.850 --> 33:07.218
And that made us think,

33:07.251 --> 33:09.287
"What do you need
to go fishing?"

33:09.320 --> 33:11.823
Well, you need
very unfashionable pants,

33:11.856 --> 33:13.157
and you need boots,

33:13.191 --> 33:16.127
and then you need
a rod and a reel.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.229
You need all those things
to go fishing.

33:18.262 --> 33:20.198
And as soon
as we thought about this

33:20.231 --> 33:22.166
with the fish hooks
and fishing,

33:22.200 --> 33:25.737
we thought we might
have a slight inkling

33:25.770 --> 33:27.839
as to how you did
the part of the trick

33:27.872 --> 33:29.340
that blew our minds,

33:29.374 --> 33:32.910
which was how you took it
right onto that reel of thread,

33:32.944 --> 33:34.679
the spool of thread.
- Yep.

33:34.712 --> 33:37.582
[laughter]

33:37.615 --> 33:40.485
[applause]

33:40.518 --> 33:42.220
- Well, I guess
you didn't fool them,

33:42.253 --> 33:44.389
but you certainly
entertained them.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.824
- Thank you!
- Thank you, Ruben Vilagrand!

33:46.858 --> 33:50.928
[cheers and applause]

33:50.962 --> 33:52.897
Don't go anywhere,
because if you do,

33:52.930 --> 33:54.766
you'll miss
something spectacular.

33:54.799 --> 33:56.768
More "Fool Us" in a moment.

33:56.801 --> 33:59.604
[cheers and applause]

34:04.675 --> 34:06.844
[jazz music]

34:06.878 --> 34:09.047
[cheers and applause]

34:09.080 --> 34:10.947
- Welcome back to "Fool Us."

34:10.982 --> 34:14.018
We've got something
very special for you up next.

34:14.052 --> 34:18.121
This magician normally performs
as part of a magic duo,

34:18.156 --> 34:20.291
but tonight
he thought it would be fun

34:20.324 --> 34:23.327
to surprise his partner
by performing alone.

34:23.360 --> 34:27.532
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Penn Jillette!

34:27.565 --> 34:30.400
[cheers and applause]
- Me?

34:30.435 --> 34:33.670
Well, I-I do happen to have
a deck of cards.

34:33.704 --> 34:35.706
Uh, I...

34:35.739 --> 34:37.675
I happen to have
a deck of card--

34:37.708 --> 34:40.844
I guess I could give it a try
to fool you.

34:40.878 --> 34:44.081
Just kind of one-on-one.
Would you like that?

34:44.114 --> 34:47.051
Why don't you come up here
and have a sit-down right here?

34:47.085 --> 34:49.152
Would you, please?
And I'm...

34:49.187 --> 34:51.255
[applause]

34:51.289 --> 34:54.324
Have yourself--have yourself
a seat right there.

34:54.358 --> 34:57.161
I have a deck of cards
right here,

34:57.195 --> 34:59.497
and I'm gonna do
a couple things.

34:59.530 --> 35:03.434
This shuffle
is for the people at home.

35:03.468 --> 35:06.804
And this cut
is for the people at home.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.373
But you, what I'd like you
to do is now very carefully--

35:09.407 --> 35:11.342
follow the directions
very carefully.

35:11.375 --> 35:14.445
Just give those cards
a cut wherever you want

35:14.479 --> 35:17.648
and then complete the cut.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.217
And then complete the cut.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.952
Now, here's what I'm gonna do--

35:20.985 --> 35:23.387
it's a little procedural
on this, okay?

35:23.421 --> 35:25.857
I'm gonna take the cards
that you just cut,

35:25.890 --> 35:27.024
and I'm gonna turn my back.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.626
And I really won't look
at anything.

35:28.659 --> 35:30.128
I'll spread them out like this.

35:30.161 --> 35:34.031
And then just take one card,
look at it yourself,

35:34.065 --> 35:36.367
Don't show it to anyone.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.870
Memorize it,
put it in your vest pocket,

35:38.903 --> 35:40.738
the left vest pocket.

35:40.771 --> 35:44.475
And then gather them up again
nice and cleanly.

35:44.509 --> 35:47.245
And give them one cut
and complete the cut.

35:47.278 --> 35:51.315
And when you've done that,
give me a couple knocks there.

35:51.349 --> 35:52.750
Oh, good, good, good.

35:52.783 --> 35:54.585
Now, what you're gonna do

35:54.619 --> 35:56.921
is you're gonna take
your jacket off, please.

35:56.954 --> 35:58.322
Take your jacket off.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.825
And then you're gonna lay
that jacket

36:00.858 --> 36:02.927
right over my hands here.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.163
This way, just like that.

36:05.196 --> 36:09.700
Now, I'll tell you the premise
of this trick right now, okay?

36:09.734 --> 36:13.004
The premise of this trick
is based on exaggeration.

36:13.037 --> 36:14.872
You know that
I exaggerate an awful lot.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.275
I exaggerate
more than anybody in the world.

36:17.308 --> 36:20.978
So I'm kind of rounding up
our experiences on this show

36:21.012 --> 36:23.314
because you are the brains
of the outfit.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.482
As a matter of fact,
with everything we do,

36:24.515 --> 36:25.683
you're always right.

36:25.716 --> 36:27.318
And that means therefore,

36:27.351 --> 36:30.388
I am...

36:30.421 --> 36:31.689
always wrong.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.558
So I'm telling you
right up front, Teller.

36:33.591 --> 36:35.293
I'm gonna tell you
right to your face.

36:35.326 --> 36:37.195
This trick

36:37.228 --> 36:40.464
will go wrong.

36:40.498 --> 36:41.999
It really will.
It's gonna wrong.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.034
It's not gonna go well.

36:43.067 --> 36:47.538
But so perfectly

36:47.572 --> 36:49.473
wrong...

36:49.507 --> 36:52.043
that I might

36:52.076 --> 36:54.679
fool you.

36:54.712 --> 36:57.481
Now, you've got one card.
It's either black or red.

36:57.515 --> 36:59.483
There's no magic in that.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.353
And I am gonna take
and show you one card.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.122
Now, if you were doing this,
the card that I showed you

37:05.156 --> 37:08.025
would match the color
of the card you have.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.694
But I do everything wrong.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.597
So, when I pull this card out
and show it to you like this,

37:12.630 --> 37:14.532
and I see that
that's a black card,

37:14.565 --> 37:17.368
that means,
because I'm always wrong,

37:17.401 --> 37:19.503
that you picked a red card,
is that right?

37:19.537 --> 37:20.638
You picked a red card.

37:20.671 --> 37:22.607
So that is

37:22.640 --> 37:26.210
the wrong color.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.980
And this is

37:29.013 --> 37:32.450
the wrong suit.

37:32.483 --> 37:34.218
So I know
it's a heart or a diamond.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.388
Now, you would pull out
the suit that matched yours.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.023
But I don't do that.
I do everything wrong,

37:39.056 --> 37:40.224
so that's a heart,

37:40.258 --> 37:43.294
which means
you have picked a diamond.

37:43.327 --> 37:46.364
Now, to see if it's a face card
or a number card,

37:46.397 --> 37:47.498
I do this.

37:47.531 --> 37:49.634
And that shows me
that it is a number card

37:49.667 --> 37:50.968
'cause that's a face card,

37:51.002 --> 37:53.137
'cause I'm doing
everything wrong, Teller.

37:53.170 --> 37:56.674
Everything wrong.
[laughter]

37:56.707 --> 37:59.210
Now, this one tells me
if it's odd or even.

37:59.243 --> 38:00.478
And I see that that's even,

38:00.511 --> 38:02.413
so I know
that your card is odd.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.914
Is that correct?

38:03.948 --> 38:06.651
And I know it's not
any of these odd cards,

38:06.684 --> 38:08.753
ace, three, five, nine.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.921
So you have picked
the seven of diamonds.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.123
Is that correct?

38:12.156 --> 38:13.357
Picked the seven of diamonds.

38:13.391 --> 38:15.359
Pull out the seven of diamonds,

38:15.393 --> 38:18.095
and show it to the audience.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.764
Show it
to the audience triumphantly.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.766
The seven of diamonds.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.167
Now you're gonna go over there,
and you're gonna sit down,

38:23.200 --> 38:25.269
and you're gonna do this alone.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.372
It's just me versus you,
one-on-one.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.641
Mano a mano,
Penn versus Teller.

38:30.675 --> 38:33.544
But you need a mouthpiece.

38:33.577 --> 38:36.480
You need someone
to speak for you.

38:36.514 --> 38:39.216
So we are gonna have
a mutual friend of ours,

38:39.250 --> 38:42.520
Piff the Magic Dragon,
a friend to us all.

38:42.553 --> 38:46.857
Now Piff will sit in my seat,

38:46.891 --> 38:48.826
and Piff will do
the talking for you.

38:48.859 --> 38:49.827
Good luck.

38:49.860 --> 38:52.530
- Penn Jillette, everyone!

38:52.563 --> 38:54.832
[cheers and applause]

38:56.534 --> 38:59.403
Well, that was very impressive.
- Well, thank you, thank you.

38:59.437 --> 39:01.238
- How long
have you been doing magic?

39:01.272 --> 39:03.174
- Uh...
[laughter]

39:03.207 --> 39:06.644
I've been doing magic
for about 45 years.

39:06.677 --> 39:08.079
- Okay, all right.

39:08.112 --> 39:09.747
- Since I met Teller.
- So still relatively new.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.916
- Yeah.
[laughter]

39:11.949 --> 39:13.484
- This is such a surprise
for Teller.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.252
Did you see his face?
- Teller had no idea.

39:15.286 --> 39:16.754
- No clue.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.323
- Teller just thought
we were doing an extra fooler.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.125
- So, technically,
you've already fooled him.

39:21.158 --> 39:22.593
- If nothing else,

39:22.626 --> 39:23.961
I think we may not
have fooled him,

39:23.994 --> 39:25.596
but we certainly surprised him.

39:25.629 --> 39:27.331
- Definitely. I think if you
don't get the trophy,

39:27.365 --> 39:29.133
you at least deserve a plaque.

39:29.166 --> 39:30.701
- I deserve
some sort of plaque.

39:30.735 --> 39:32.670
- Right. Yeah.
Oh, are you ready already?

39:32.703 --> 39:34.038
- We are ready.
- [gasps]

39:34.071 --> 39:35.306
- Okay.
- I'm ready.

39:35.339 --> 39:37.341
- Here we go.
- Let's go to Piff and see

39:37.375 --> 39:40.778
if Teller knows
how you did your trick.

39:40.811 --> 39:43.514
- All right.

39:43.547 --> 39:47.518
Well, Teller has given it
his best shot,

39:47.551 --> 39:51.021
and he says that Penn has
completely fooled him, so...

39:51.055 --> 39:53.524
- Well, thank you so much.
Let's bring down the--

39:53.557 --> 39:55.326
[laughter]

39:55.359 --> 39:56.827
- I feel like
that's not what happened.

39:56.861 --> 39:58.996
- Is that not correct?

39:59.029 --> 40:00.064
I think
I might've misunderstood.

40:00.097 --> 40:01.232
Hang on a second.

40:01.265 --> 40:02.833
Can you just run that
by me one more time?

40:02.867 --> 40:05.669
Just whisper--
just one more time.

40:07.772 --> 40:10.975
He says, "Fool me once,
shame on you."

40:11.008 --> 40:12.476
[Alyson laughs]

40:12.510 --> 40:13.577
That's it,
just shame on you.

40:13.611 --> 40:15.579
[laughter]

40:15.613 --> 40:18.048
Teller also said to me
that Piff and Teller

40:18.082 --> 40:20.050
has a much stronger ring to it.

40:20.084 --> 40:22.386
[mutters]

40:22.420 --> 40:26.223
- But if nothing else, Teller,
I did surprise you, didn't I?

40:26.257 --> 40:28.225
- He says,
"No, he knew it all along."

40:28.259 --> 40:30.928
[laughter]

40:30.961 --> 40:32.563
- Piff, thank you so much.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.031
Thank you
for being in my corner,

40:34.064 --> 40:37.067
but I believe
that we have to do this

40:37.101 --> 40:39.069
very specially,
just one-on-one.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.071
Teller, come up here.
We'll have a little discussion

40:41.105 --> 40:42.840
right here
in front of everybody.

40:42.873 --> 40:45.242
Okay, what do you got?

40:49.747 --> 40:52.082
We never--Teller knew nothing
about this till we did this.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.584
It really was
a complete surprise.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.586
We pretended we were just
shooting a regular fooler,

40:55.619 --> 40:57.588
and there's
no precedent for this,

40:57.621 --> 41:01.659
and Teller thinks
that I half-fooled him

41:01.692 --> 41:04.462
and maybe
we bring down the trophy

41:04.495 --> 41:06.030
and split it in half.
What do you think?

41:06.063 --> 41:07.898
Can we bring down the trophy?
- Yeah!

41:07.932 --> 41:10.000
[cheers and applause]

41:10.034 --> 41:14.138
- You can hold that.

41:14.171 --> 41:16.373
And we share
that trophy together.

41:16.407 --> 41:17.842
- Aw.

41:17.875 --> 41:21.011
[cheers and applause continue]

41:21.045 --> 41:24.148
We all just witnessed
Penn versus Teller.

41:24.181 --> 41:25.649
Penn even found a way to earn

41:25.683 --> 41:28.219
a fooler trophy
on his own show.

41:28.252 --> 41:30.354
Come back next week
for the reunion

41:30.387 --> 41:31.755
of Penn and Teller

41:31.789 --> 41:33.757
and more amazing magic.

41:33.791 --> 41:34.992
We'll see you soon.

41:35.025 --> 41:37.561
[cheers and applause continue]
