Max, don't let life get you down.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.868
Just yesterday,
life punched me in the gut.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.369
And you know what I did?

13:07.453 --> 13:09.830
I said, "Life, what else you got?"

13:10.289 --> 13:12.374
Mom said we had to use the other bathroom

13:12.458 --> 13:14.460
because you were crying in the shower.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.714
That is not true at all.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.382
I was crying in the bathtub.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.553
But then this morning,
Becky and I went down to the station,

13:24.637 --> 13:26.138
and we asked for our jobs back.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.266
And how does that help me with Rose?

13:31.060 --> 13:33.103
It doesn't. I just needed to tell someone.

13:35.397 --> 13:38.484
Well... Thanks for the pep talk.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.278
I feel so much better.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.196
You do?

13:42.279 --> 13:43.364
No!

13:43.447 --> 13:45.533
I just want this conversation to be over.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.121
Danny, the station called.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.206
Already?

13:52.706 --> 13:54.124
What did they say?

13:54.583 --> 13:56.710
-Hey, guys. We got great news.
-Great news.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.962
We got great news, too.

13:58.045 --> 14:00.130
-What did the station say?
-They want me back.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.632
I knew it! I knew it.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.093
They want me back!
Danny Tanner is back on top.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.135
No, Danny. They...

14:05.636 --> 14:06.554
They want me back.

14:07.596 --> 14:08.430
Oh.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.308
They want me to co-host a new
women's talk show called  The Gab.

14:13.852 --> 14:16.230
Whoo-hoo! My wife's working again.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.565
We're back on the gravy train.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.191

14:20.901 --> 14:21.986

14:22.069 --> 14:23.571
I'm happy for you, Becky.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.906
And I'll just follow my own advice and...

14:25.990 --> 14:27.408
drink some chocolate milk,

14:27.491 --> 14:29.076
over here all by myself.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.371
[Jesse] Great.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.455
Guess what.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.165
We bought back the Smash Club.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.334
-Isn't that fantastic?
-[scoffs]

14:37.960 --> 14:41.547
Don't you think that this is something
you and I should have discussed first?

14:44.091 --> 14:45.342
Yes, I do!

14:45.426 --> 14:46.802
I do think that.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.928
So, let's discuss it.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.390
What do you think about Joey and I
buying the Smash Club?

14:52.850 --> 14:55.311
-That we already bought.
-That we already bought.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.440
I guess I think it's a great idea,
because we all have jobs.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.275
We all have jobs!

15:01.358 --> 15:02.902
We all have jobs!

-Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

15:09.825 --> 15:10.951
Oh. Sorry, Danny.

15:12.286 --> 15:15.372
Most of us have jobs!
Most of us have jobs!

15:15.456 --> 15:18.000
Most of us have jobs!
Most of us have jobs!

15:18.083 --> 15:19.418
What's with the screaming?

15:19.501 --> 15:20.878
-Most of us have jobs.
-Yeah.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.756
Joey and I bought the Smash Club back.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.133
-Oh, congratulations.
-That's amazing!

15:26.216 --> 15:27.801
Why don't we have the party there?

15:28.385 --> 15:31.764
Oh. Yeah, that would be great.
I won't have to do the dishes!

15:33.390 --> 15:34.266
Yeah.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.394
Then I won't have to hide in the
bathroom until DJ's done with the dishes.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.981
And let's everybody Wang Chung tonight

15:41.065 --> 15:43.525
by wearing their best outfits
from the '80s.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.740
That's great. An '80s costume party.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.201
Just when I thought today
couldn't get better.

15:54.536 --> 15:58.290
Well, we do have a special mystery guest
waiting for you in the living room.

16:01.001 --> 16:01.919
The Beach Boys?

16:03.629 --> 16:04.838
Even better.

-[Jesse] Who's better than the Beach Boys?
-I don't know.

Hi, Danny.

16:11.804 --> 16:12.888

This is better than the Beach Boys.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.487
Well, looks like our work here is done.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.240
I wonder who else we can track down?

-Aw.
-Aw.

It's so good to see you. You look great.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.166
You look great, too.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.794
Thank you.
It's unanimous. We both look great.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.170
[laughs]

16:45.254 --> 16:46.213
How did you find me?

16:46.755 --> 16:49.717
Well, it wasn't that hard.
You're still in the same old house.

16:51.343 --> 16:53.429
Would you like a seat
on the same old couch?

16:53.512 --> 16:55.014
Absolutely. [chuckles]

16:56.140 --> 16:57.224
[sighs]

16:58.100 --> 17:00.102
We had some great times.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.729
You were so funny.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.939
Do you still vacuum your fridge every day?

17:06.483 --> 17:08.736
No, I'm not that neurotic anymore.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.863
It's every other day.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.241
So what are you up to now?

17:14.825 --> 17:18.370
Well, I'm divorced and unemployed,

17:18.871 --> 17:21.790
and this morning I woke up in bed
with Jesse and Joey

17:21.874 --> 17:23.459
and some guy named Fernando.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.672
Wait.
You're still living with Jesse and Joey?

17:28.756 --> 17:30.215
No, it was just a slumber party

17:30.299 --> 17:32.760
with three or four or five guys,

17:32.843 --> 17:33.677
um...

17:34.344 --> 17:37.181
just trying to stay warm
on a cold, foggy night.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.058
Anyway,

17:39.475 --> 17:40.434
this evening,

17:40.517 --> 17:43.437
the girls are throwing
a "Dad-iversary" party for us

17:43.520 --> 17:44.772
at the Smash Club,

17:44.855 --> 17:45.773
if you'd like to go.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.525
You guys are still naming your parties?

17:50.736 --> 17:52.946
And there's still a Smash Club?

17:53.989 --> 17:56.241
Don't tell me Jesse and the Rippers
are playing.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.411
No, I doubt those guys are still alive.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.373
FYI, it's '80s themed.

18:03.707 --> 18:05.000
Just like your furniture.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.135

dogs and babies,

18:15.219 --> 18:16.345
may I present...

18:16.428 --> 18:17.429

18:39.034 --> 18:40.828
Man, you tell this family to dress up,

18:40.911 --> 18:42.329
and they don't mess around.

18:43.705 --> 18:46.166
Well, is the Smash Club still radical
or what?

18:46.250 --> 18:49.253
At the risk of bursting your bubble,
this is a laundromat.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.588
Yes, I know that. It is now,

18:51.672 --> 18:54.007
but Joey and I are gonna restore it
to its former glory.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.927
Wouldn't it have been easier
to buy a nightclub and rename it?

18:57.010 --> 19:00.556
No, it wouldn't have been easier, huh,
because it's too late. We paid cash.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.476
That's how we got an eight-hour escrow.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.521
Who are those guys?

19:08.105 --> 19:09.273
Hey, it's the Rippers.

19:15.529 --> 19:19.324
-What are you guys doing here?
-It's Saturday night. We're doing laundry.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.870
Hey, Ramona. Look...

19:22.953 --> 19:24.830
I'm sorry I called you a friend-snatcher.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.290
That's OK.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.458
I'm sorry I called you a big fat baby.

19:29.668 --> 19:32.838
-When did you call me a big fat baby?
-Just now. To get even.

19:34.256 --> 19:36.592
Rocki, I'm sorry
for going off on you, too.

19:37.384 --> 19:40.137
If you don't wanna be my girlfriend,
then, that's cool.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.097
I'm just not really into labels,

19:42.181 --> 19:43.515
so, let's just be friends.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.641
OK.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.728
But can we be friends
who make out once in a while?

19:49.438 --> 19:50.397
Sure, why not?

19:51.773 --> 19:53.692
In that case, let the friendship begin!

for one Don Johnson,

20:16.298 --> 20:17.132

about your job offer,

20:35.525 --> 20:37.152

20:37.819 --> 20:40.989
Wait. But, Deej, we're finally getting
our big chance to be together.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.908
Yeah, but I don't want you to miss out.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.952
Which is why I called the Lakers,

20:45.035 --> 20:47.037
and told them you're taking the job.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.550
Who are you?

21:41.633 --> 21:43.176
Some lady named Madonna.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.469
She wore a lot of crosses,

21:44.553 --> 21:47.347
so I'm guessing
she was a religious leader.

And...

24:10.824 --> 24:14.244
I am also moving back to San Francisco.

24:16.037 --> 24:16.997
[Kimmy] Hey!

24:18.290 --> 24:21.585
With my four incredible children.

24:24.671 --> 24:27.591
Boo!

24:29.426 --> 24:31.720
Oh, come on.
You know you're all thinking it.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.807
Well, I'm not gonna live in LA
all by myself,

24:35.891 --> 24:37.642
so I'm moving back here, too.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.024
Right back in my old house.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.028
You're-- You're moving back in with us?

24:48.111 --> 24:49.237
[Danny] I sure am.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.239
I'll just move back into my old bedroom,

24:51.323 --> 24:54.451
and then, you can bunk with DJ,
just like the good old days.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.455
[both] Yeah!

25:00.123 --> 25:03.668
Anyway, um, I wrote a song
for my three dads,

25:03.752 --> 25:06.129
but really, it applies to all of you.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.882
It's about how you bring me luck.

25:08.965 --> 25:11.218
And it's called "You Bring Me Luck."

25:14.554 --> 25:15.764
[Stephanie] Thanks, Jess.

Kimmy,
