I missed you, man!

12:32.543 --> 12:35.212
Ah, that's the B.O. I like to smell.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.965
Yo! [laughs]

12:38.382 --> 12:40.009
Good to have you back, Frostee.

12:44.221 --> 12:45.681
Now, get out of the car.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.142
I don't take commands anymore.

12:48.225 --> 12:51.395
You guys don't seem to get it.
I'm better as a lone wolf.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.981
Kiss your last key goodbye, Shashi.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.275
[engine revving]

12:57.109 --> 12:59.612
Layla Gray, you are fun.

12:59.695 --> 13:01.614
-[tires squeal]
-[grunts]

13:01.989 --> 13:03.657
[panting]

13:04.617 --> 13:06.327
[rumbling]

13:06.577 --> 13:08.370
What the...? [gasps]

13:15.586 --> 13:16.795
[car beeps]

13:16.879 --> 13:19.340
[rumbling continues]

13:19.423 --> 13:21.008
[panting]

13:37.066 --> 13:38.108
[Frostee gasps]

13:38.192 --> 13:40.194
[panting]

13:46.659 --> 13:48.035
This doesn't seem good.

13:48.244 --> 13:52.164
I never thought I'd say this, but I hope
this is a government weather machine.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.250
The cars are keys,

13:54.542 --> 13:56.961
and this is what they unlock.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.839
What is this place?

14:01.131 --> 14:02.132
A tomb.

14:05.302 --> 14:08.973
My mother and father believed that if they
came to America and worked hard,

14:09.056 --> 14:13.018
they could use their talents to create
a better life and a better world.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.436
They were geniuses,

14:14.687 --> 14:15.854
but they were naive.

14:15.938 --> 14:20.985
They trusted five rich men who used
their minds to create Skeleton Key.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.238
It was technology
decades ahead of its time,

14:24.321 --> 14:26.740
able to control anything computerized.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.910
The men knew they had discovered
something invaluable.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.413
They also knew
they couldn't trust each other.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.957
So they built this vault to lock it away,

14:35.040 --> 14:36.834
made five keys to keep it safe,

14:37.042 --> 14:40.296
and then killed the only other people
who knew about it.

14:41.463 --> 14:42.506
Your parents.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.885
[Shashi] They buried them here,
along with their dream.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.094
[rumbling ends]

14:47.177 --> 14:49.054
Now I'm digging that dream up,

14:49.138 --> 14:51.765
and it's going to become
those billionaires' nightmare.

14:53.726 --> 14:57.730
They've been using it to build
the greatest fortune in the world.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.482
But all it has built...

15:01.734 --> 15:03.611
it can also destroy.

15:04.194 --> 15:06.989
You only robbed four of them.
That means there's one left.

15:07.197 --> 15:09.992
Cleve Kelso,
the one who pulled the trigger,

15:10.075 --> 15:12.077
he's about to see a ghost.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.787
[rumbling resumes]

15:13.871 --> 15:16.040
I know you understand family, Tony.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.833
You understand justice.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.335
Help me.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.670
Help you what?
I can't bring your parents back.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.341
But you can make sure that
the next generation of people like them

15:25.424 --> 15:26.675
has a fair shot.

15:26.842 --> 15:29.470
Today, we can level the playing field.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.015
Help me use Skeleton Key
to unlock all the vaults in the world

15:33.098 --> 15:34.850
and give everything away.

15:35.059 --> 15:37.645
I'm about to create a world without rules.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.940
In a world like that,
I'm going to need some real outlaws.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.358
I need a Toretto.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.363
You're not made for a life
on a government leash.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.906
Come with me, Tony.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.492
Help me destroy this entire corrupt system

15:51.575 --> 15:54.078
and take out the man
who murdered my parents.

15:55.037 --> 15:55.871
[Tony] No.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.247
I can't.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.250
You've got it all wrong, Shashi.
Family isn't about revenge.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.670
It's about helping each other.
It's about healing.

16:02.753 --> 16:05.547
Destroy Skeleton Key
and walk away from all this.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.257
I won't stop you.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.302
I'm disappointed, Tony.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.846
I thought you,
of all people, would understand.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.057
But I guess I'll have to do this myself.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.017
You're not getting out with that key!

16:17.101 --> 16:18.602
[grunting continues]

16:42.209 --> 16:43.377
[yells]

16:45.337 --> 16:46.922
[cackling]

16:48.632 --> 16:49.758
[yells]

17:03.147 --> 17:04.690
[laughs and yells]

17:06.817 --> 17:07.818
You ready?

17:08.318 --> 17:09.403
Born.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.655
Let's... do this!

17:13.782 --> 17:16.326
[skull cackling]

17:16.410 --> 17:18.662
[video games beeping]

17:21.999 --> 17:24.918
Bet you didn't expect my mage
to level so quickly.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.462
Watch out for my trap.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.130
Aw! [grunts]

17:28.213 --> 17:30.549
That's it! It's mana-drain time.

17:30.632 --> 17:31.633
[Tony] Cisco!

17:33.260 --> 17:35.429
-You got to stop this elevator.
-How?

17:37.014 --> 17:38.348
You'll think of something.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.108
Yo, Cisco!

17:48.192 --> 17:51.070
The key cars,
they could jam up the elevator!

17:51.153 --> 17:52.654
[grunting continues]

18:03.749 --> 18:04.583
[gasps]

18:08.545 --> 18:12.091
-Forgot to level your minions, I see.
-Shut up! It's oblique warfare!

18:12.382 --> 18:14.635
It's  dumb  warfare!

18:14.718 --> 18:16.011
[laughs]

18:17.137 --> 18:18.138
[Shashi] Come on!

18:23.268 --> 18:25.270
We could have ruled the world,
like a family!

18:26.939 --> 18:29.525
Stop, Shashi!
It's not too late to end this.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.735
It's 16 years too late!

18:32.027 --> 18:33.612
Sixteen years I spent alone!

18:37.991 --> 18:39.993
[helicopters whirring]

18:41.370 --> 18:42.371
[both gasp]

19:11.650 --> 19:13.152
We have you surrounded!

19:13.235 --> 19:15.487
Drop Skeleton Key and back away,

19:15.821 --> 19:18.198
or you will be met with lethal force!

19:18.699 --> 19:21.201
It's over, man. The government's here.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.329
They won't be the government for long.

19:28.041 --> 19:32.838
Not when every tank and every plane
gets ripped from their control!

19:33.839 --> 19:35.465
[beeping]

19:39.303 --> 19:40.804
[alarm beeping]

[grunts]

19:43.182 --> 19:45.225
[indistinct radio chatter]

19:48.604 --> 19:50.564
I can feel my parents with me,

19:50.647 --> 19:52.858
their code racing through my mind!

19:53.108 --> 19:54.318
[yelling]

20:00.824 --> 20:02.409
[screams and grunts]

20:03.452 --> 20:05.078
He's got the key! Take him out!

[Dudley gasps]

20:48.830 --> 20:50.249
I've got to warn Cleve.

20:56.838 --> 21:01.218
[Shashi] It's time we paid a visit
to the man who killed my parents.

21:01.301 --> 21:05.639
And he's in the perfect place
for the whole world to go bust -

21:06.014 --> 21:07.432
Las Vegas.

21:11.353 --> 21:14.564
This was going to be your car,
but you've ruined it.

21:14.982 --> 21:15.983
[snaps fingers]

21:19.278 --> 21:20.279
Hey!

21:20.362 --> 21:21.488
[all gasp]

21:31.164 --> 21:32.791
I can't believe he blew up my car.

21:32.874 --> 21:35.085
What are you talking about?
That was my car.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.295
What?

21:36.378 --> 21:38.505
You were going to drive off and leave him.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.383
He wanted  me  to help him
get his revenge, OK, not you.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.510
I was literally on his team!

21:43.593 --> 21:46.596
There was a plan where
I was supposed to drive that car away.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.015
Agree to disagree.

21:48.098 --> 21:50.017
All right. So, what do we do now?

21:50.309 --> 21:53.520
We still have the spy plane and our cars.
We head him off and stop him.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.564
Didn't you see what just happened?

21:55.647 --> 21:59.026
He can control all of our stuff
with Skeleton Key.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.777
And when that thing gets to Vegas,

22:00.861 --> 22:03.613
he's going to be able to tap into
the main electrical grid,

22:03.697 --> 22:05.032
amplify his power,

22:05.115 --> 22:08.285
and control the whole world.
