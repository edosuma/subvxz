00:03.128 --> 00:06.173
<i>Here's the deal:
Turk and Elliot wrote a paper</i>

00:06.256 --> 00:08.050
<i>on peripheral vascular disease.</i>

00:08.132 --> 00:11.220
<i>They're upset because they
have to present it at a conference.</i>

00:11.303 --> 00:14.473
Do you know how many interns
would die to do that?

00:14.556 --> 00:18.268
Not me, l don't care. l know my paper
was a trillion times better.

00:18.352 --> 00:22.773
lt's so political. Surprise! They went
with the black guy and the girl.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.025
- Bambi.
- What?

00:25.108 --> 00:27.736
What right do they have to be mopey?

00:27.819 --> 00:31.114
<i>That's when Elliot said
something that explained everything.</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:33.242
Our parents are coming.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.327
Oh, l am so sorry.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.538
<i>I could tell my friends were upset.</i>

00:37.621 --> 00:40.332
<i>- Still, there was a bright side.
- lt's all right.</i>

00:40.415 --> 00:42.417
<i>I knew I could make it worse.</i>

00:42.501 --> 00:44.253
- Missed a spot!
- You could help!

00:44.336 --> 00:47.297
- You can't even hear the TV!
- l like the pictures.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.674
<i>If I believed in karma,</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:51.802
<i>I'd be more cautious
about giving these guys a hard time.</i>

00:51.885 --> 00:54.721
Hey, Dad.
No, no, nothing.

00:54.805 --> 00:58.350
Turk and Elliot are freaking out
because their parents are coming.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.935
<i>But karma doesn't scare me.</i>

01:00.018 --> 01:03.188
No. lt hasn't been that long
since you and l saw each other.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.482
- Dad?
- Hey, Mr Dorian.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.276
Hey, boys, what's shakin'?

01:07.359 --> 01:09.278
- Who needs a beer?
- Who doesn't?

01:10.737 --> 01:13.031
You see, JD,
this is what goes around.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.200
But this?
This is what comes around.

01:15.284 --> 01:17.327
- Get out of here.
- Only two left.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.747
- That's all right. JD'll go out.
- Oh, get some chips.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.601
Wowser, Rowdy's a boy dog.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.270
<i>My mom and dad
got divorced when I was seven.</i>

01:43.353 --> 01:46.481
<i>That's not unusual, but though
everybody's relationship</i>

01:46.565 --> 01:50.861
<i>with their father is different, mine has
always seemed very different.</i>

01:50.944 --> 01:54.364
God, l'd like to take a run at her.
Look at that rack.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.701
- Dad, please.
- l'm sorry, Johnny. l'm just a man.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.704
- You know what they say about men.
- They love boobies.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.581
That's is correct, Christopher.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.083
OK, you know, l think
l'm gonna hit the sack

02:05.167 --> 02:07.211
before l get
even more uncomfortable.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.295
Your mother had a beautiful bosom.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.590
- There it is.
- Would you stay?

02:11.673 --> 02:13.926
We've got a lot of catching up
to do. Please.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.053
OK.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.847
You guys have a policy on farting?

02:18.931 --> 02:20.224
No, let 'er rip.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.560
Fire in the hole.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.062
Oh, my God, Dad.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.773
Count it!

02:27.856 --> 02:29.858
That was a nice moment.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.821
<i>I guess everyone's parents
drive them crazy.</i>

02:34.905 --> 02:37.991
So this is my hospital.

02:38.075 --> 02:40.410
lt's stunning.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.790
Honey, is there a rule against
looking pretty here?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.251
Nothing official.

02:47.334 --> 02:51.296
l just think you would look
so much more handsome in blue scrubs.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.422
Thank you, Mommy,

02:52.506 --> 02:55.259
but l like my green scrubs better.

02:55.342 --> 02:58.887
<i>Parents have a way of making
their children regress.</i>

02:58.971 --> 03:01.682
l don't want to wear blue scrubs!

03:01.765 --> 03:04.810
Come on. Boy, you better
watch your manners.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.645
Come on, now.

03:06.728 --> 03:10.732
You can't have one, sweetheart.
Perms are for trailer trash.

03:10.816 --> 03:14.027
What in the hell is this,
parents' weekend?

03:14.111 --> 03:16.321
Sort of.
Elliot and Turk wrote this paper,

03:16.405 --> 03:18.824
then my dad decided
''l wanna come too,'' so...

03:18.907 --> 03:21.493
Look, Reba, if l ask you a question

03:21.577 --> 03:24.496
that doesn't specifically deal
with a medical issue,

03:24.580 --> 03:27.833
you can bet your powdered bottom
l don't want you to answer.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.668
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.421
lt's like working with a monkey.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.385
- What?
- Nothing.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.888
Why didn't you introduce me
to your mother?

03:40.971 --> 03:44.683
Because she just came by to say ''hey''
before she checked into her hotel.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.977
She's coming back
later to look around.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.813
OK. l was worried you thought
she might not like me.

03:49.897 --> 03:53.025
She's not gonna like you.
Baby, look.

03:53.108 --> 03:56.570
My mother's never called any girl
l've been with by her name.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.031
She called my college
girlfriend The Big Easy.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.617
Well, was she fat and slutty?

04:01.700 --> 04:03.452
She had beautiful skin.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.579
Don't smile, woman. She did.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.539
Just beautiful.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.083
So, what do you guys think?

04:10.167 --> 04:13.170
l think it's time to get back
to the suite and get in a bath.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.881
This place makes me feel dirty.

04:15.964 --> 04:19.927
Dr Kelso? Dr Kelso,
these are my parents.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.637
Ah, well!

04:21.720 --> 04:25.474
lt's a pleasure to meet the trees
from which our little acorns fall.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.476
- Bob Kelso.
- Simon Reid.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.853
l'm chief of medicine
at St Augustine's.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.689
lt's a private hospital in Greenwich.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.526
l know what you're thinking.
You didn't ask.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.861
Nobody ever does.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.739
So, how long
are you guys staying?

04:44.576 --> 04:47.120
Can l help you, sir?

04:47.204 --> 04:49.164
- Sir?
- You can help me

04:49.248 --> 04:51.708
by minding your own damn business.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.920
Excuse me?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.130
Oh, aggressive, huh?

04:57.214 --> 05:00.551
Do you really want to
get it on with me, pipsqueak?

05:00.634 --> 05:03.011
Because if you do, l guarantee

05:03.095 --> 05:07.224
it'll be the last stupid thing
you ever do on God's green earth.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.810
Nice meeting you.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.271
<i>What the hell was that all about?</i>

05:14.231 --> 05:17.025
Dad. Don't wander off like that.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.488
This is your basic
arthrocentesis there.

05:21.572 --> 05:24.575
Your resident should've
shown you how to do this.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.076
<i>He can't be that mad.</i>

05:26.159 --> 05:28.787
<i>Even though residents
are supposed to teach you,</i>

05:28.871 --> 05:31.123
<i>they only show up
when they want something.</i>

05:31.206 --> 05:33.917
l have to give the students
a lecture on heart murmurs.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.752
- Could you do it?
- Actually...

05:35.836 --> 05:37.212
Thanks, man.

05:39.131 --> 05:43.260
That sucks. l totally wanted to spend
some time with my dad tomorrow.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.262
Then take him.

05:45.345 --> 05:47.431
- What do you mean?
- l don't know?

05:47.514 --> 05:50.350
Secure some kind of vehicle,
car, balloon, tricycle,

05:50.434 --> 05:53.937
and transport your father from where
he is to where you're going.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.772
l don't think you get my dad.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.525
He's not interested in my work.
He's more of like a buddy.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.612
OK. That was my mistake.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.324
Here, l engaged you and gave you
the impression that l actually care,

06:05.407 --> 06:08.535
which is just so wrong! God!

06:08.619 --> 06:10.871
The thing is,
l don't need a buddy.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.664
What l need is a father.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.708
You definitely need something.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.086
Maybe a backbone.
Or perhaps some testicles.

06:18.170 --> 06:21.757
At the very least, a pillow that
you could carry around the hospital

06:21.840 --> 06:26.428
and just cry your sad eyes out
into whenever trauma...

06:26.512 --> 06:29.014
l have testicles.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.849
He's a kidder.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.769
All right, this is it.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.855
Brace yourself and let me handle
this nice and smooth.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.525
All right?
Hey, Mom, guess what.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.152
Hi, Mrs Turk,
l'm gonna cut to the chase.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.405
l'm Carla. l apologise if your
son hasn't told you about me.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.450
l don't know how you've
put up with him as long as you did.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.869
Still, you should know
he loves me very much,

06:50.953 --> 06:53.664
l feel the same
and we're really good together.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.999
- Are you two sharing a bed?
- No!

06:56.083 --> 06:57.584
Yes, ma'am, we are.

06:57.668 --> 07:01.964
But if you're a good judge of character,
you can tell l'm not messing around.

07:02.047 --> 07:05.342
- Carla. lt's a nice name.
- Thank you.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.804
- Yes, it is, Mother.
- Oh, please. Not telling me about her.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.807
Dear, do me a favour.
Don't give him any for a month or so.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.393
- Done.
- lt can't go down like that.

07:14.476 --> 07:16.728
lt just can't go down like that.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.940
After you, sir.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.275
Well, l'll be.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.069
l haven't seen a ward
like this since Vietnam.

07:24.152 --> 07:27.531
So where in Connecticut
was your National Guard unit stationed?

07:27.614 --> 07:29.616
- Amusing.
- l thought so.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.911
l think they're totally
getting along, don't you?

07:34.037 --> 07:37.332
l'm about to open
a fat can of whup-ass on you.

07:37.416 --> 07:39.793
Bring it on, bitch.

07:40.377 --> 07:45.090
All right, sports fans,
we have a guest today at rounds,

07:45.174 --> 07:47.509
so let's try and be sharp.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.636
Why don't we begin with,

07:49.720 --> 07:51.972
l don't know, Dr Reid.

07:52.055 --> 07:55.767
What is the nutritional cause
of high output cardiac failure?

07:55.851 --> 07:58.061
Wet beriberi
from thiamine deficiency.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.064
Yes, it is. Next question.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.066
Why don't we try...

08:05.611 --> 08:07.237
...Dr Reid.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.489
l already went, sir.

08:09.573 --> 08:13.493
- Oh, are you done for the day?
- No.

08:13.577 --> 08:17.664
What's the mechanism of Cheyne-Stokes
respiration in systolic dysfunction?

08:17.748 --> 08:19.416
<i>What? Nobody knows that.</i>

08:19.500 --> 08:21.919
Prolongation of circulation time
from lung to brain

08:22.002 --> 08:24.630
causing diminished sensitivity
of the respiratory centre

08:24.713 --> 08:26.798
to arterial partial pressure
of carbon dioxide?

08:26.882 --> 08:28.884
Yes.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.308
My dad winked at me!

08:37.392 --> 08:40.102
lf that's not saying,
''l love you, l'm proud of you,''

08:40.187 --> 08:41.813
- l'm not sure what is.
- l know!

08:41.897 --> 08:45.234
There are no gratuitous winks
in the Reid household.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.694
<i>And that's when I decided
to take a chance.</i>

08:47.778 --> 08:52.491
l'd love to come to your heart murmur
lecture. l'm a big fan of those things.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.159
That means a lot, Dad.

08:54.243 --> 08:56.245
<i>Absolutely. Please.</i>

08:56.328 --> 08:58.705
Oh, dear Lord,
please make it stop.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.751
- lt's stunning.
- Thank you.

09:02.835 --> 09:05.212
- And l understand that you...
- l make these.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.882
Like two wolves gabbing about
which sheep to eat.

09:08.966 --> 09:12.970
Unfortunately for them, l'm a man.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.848
- Turk.
- Coming.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.975
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.893
Hi, Mrs Turk.

09:19.977 --> 09:22.312
John Dorian, get over here.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.401
After all these years,
are you still afraid of me?

09:27.484 --> 09:31.822
On Thanksgiving, l said your turkey was
dry, and you picked me up and shook me.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.074
- Then don't say that.
- Silly Bambi.

09:34.157 --> 09:35.534
You guys, leave him alone.

09:35.617 --> 09:39.204
l've had enough of you two
conspiring and whatnot. lt ends now!

09:39.288 --> 09:42.332
lt is so cute when he
thinks he's in charge.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.544
<i>- l know. lt kills me.
- And that's when it happened.</i>

09:45.627 --> 09:49.298
You should see him when l pretend
to let him...make a decision!

09:51.842 --> 09:56.638
<i>That's when Carla realised
she was exactly like Turk's mom.</i>

10:02.436 --> 10:04.521
Great job at rounds today, Dr Reid.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.649
- Thank you, sir.
- Your dad must've been very impressed.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.234
Yeah, l think so.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.695
l could tell that
he respected you, sir.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.114
Well, that's very nice,
but lucky for me,

10:14.198 --> 10:17.409
my self-esteem isn't tied up
in that kind of poppycock.

10:17.492 --> 10:20.662
l didn't become a doctor
to impress my daddy or anyone else.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.498
l did it for me.

10:22.581 --> 10:25.751
l've seen lots of doctors
get into this for the wrong reason.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.420
- You know what happens to them?
- No.

10:28.504 --> 10:31.256
They quit and get
their real estate licence.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.551
You look upset, sweetheart.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.136
You shouldn't be.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.805
l think you'd look super
in a gold blazer.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.933
Thank you?

10:42.768 --> 10:45.020
This is almost too easy.

10:47.523 --> 10:49.441
Well, work is great, Johnny.

10:49.525 --> 10:52.277
l like to believe
that l'm selling dreams.

10:52.361 --> 10:56.949
- But, Dad, you sell office supplies.
- Yeah, l prefer to call them dreams.

10:57.032 --> 11:00.369
l'm gonna steal another Jell-O.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.580
<i>I always thought parents
were like tornadoes.</i>

11:03.664 --> 11:07.668
<i>They blow into town
and devastate everything in their path.</i>

11:07.751 --> 11:10.254
- Hi.
- There's no food on your tray.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.422
Oh.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.550
<i>But it's different for me.</i>

11:16.510 --> 11:18.512
How you doing, Elliot?

11:20.180 --> 11:23.183
Great talk. Anyway, Johnny,

11:23.267 --> 11:26.103
l was talking to my buddy, Jake,
this afternoon.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.064
- You remember Jake?
- No.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.859
Jake's my buddy,
and he's leaving the country

11:31.942 --> 11:34.236
for who knows how long.
So l thought l might

11:34.319 --> 11:37.072
get out of here tomorrow
and go catch up with him.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.615
l'd miss your thing,

11:38.699 --> 11:41.201
but l wouldn't know
what l was hearing anyway.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.245
- Right?
- Right.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.330
<i>I think what surprised me the most</i>

11:45.414 --> 11:47.791
<i>is that I was actually surprised.</i>

11:47.875 --> 11:49.710
You still talking to yourself?

11:49.793 --> 11:51.795
l thought you'd outgrow that by now.

11:57.968 --> 12:00.721
<i>I probably should've
woken him up to say goodbye</i>

12:00.804 --> 12:03.265
<i>considering he'd be gone
before I got home.</i>

12:03.348 --> 12:06.268
<i>I told myself I wanted to let
the old guy get some sleep,</i>

12:06.351 --> 12:09.354
<i>but even I didn't believe that.</i>

12:13.609 --> 12:15.068
You keep eating that,

12:15.152 --> 12:17.821
there'll be nothing left
for a man to put a ring on.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.907
Mom...

12:19.990 --> 12:21.950
...l started therapy.

12:22.034 --> 12:24.870
Do you know that Amy Swanson's
marrying Drew Gertson?

12:24.953 --> 12:26.997
Drew is such a nice boy.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.750
Drew used to hold people down
and spit in their mouths.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.418
He doesn't do that anymore.

12:31.502 --> 12:34.505
Mom, when l was a little girl,
did l want to be a doctor?

12:34.588 --> 12:37.382
Maybe l used a toy stethoscope
on one of my dolls?

12:37.466 --> 12:40.928
Oh, honey,
you'd have to ask the nanny.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.305
Have you ever reached
a point in your life

12:43.388 --> 12:46.058
when you really wished
you knew how you got there?

12:46.141 --> 12:48.393
Are you trying to tell me
you're a lesbian?

12:48.477 --> 12:50.187
Yes, l am.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.022
Yep.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.816
That's exactly...
exactly what l'm saying, Mom.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.572
Yo, JD. You want to grab
a bite to eat with us tonight

13:00.656 --> 13:02.699
after we do our presentation?

13:02.783 --> 13:04.326
Yeah, l'm not that busy.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.871
lf you're not busy, you have time
to do this discharge summary.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.833
- l meant that later l'm not that busy.
- Fantastic.

13:10.916 --> 13:14.628
l told my mom you like that Cuban
restaurant. She loves Cuban food...

13:14.711 --> 13:16.588
l hate that restaurant.

13:16.672 --> 13:20.759
<i>You said you loved it and wanted
to be buried in a vat of plátanos</i>

13:20.843 --> 13:22.344
so you could eat your way out.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.472
See? That's our problem.
You don't get me.

13:25.556 --> 13:27.015
No argument there.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.271
Hey, hey, hey!
You missed a spot, right there.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.106
Well, lucky for me, Dad,

13:34.189 --> 13:38.235
l spend my life going in a circle around
this place cleaning up after the sick.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.821
Tomorrow l'll probably
be here at the same time.

13:40.904 --> 13:44.908
You know that l hate sass, so
drop right down and give me 20.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.744
- That could be faecal matter.
- Make it 30.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.997
Fine.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.665
<i>What is it with parents?</i>

13:51.748 --> 13:54.418
<i>Why is it so easy for them
to make us feel bad?</i>

13:54.501 --> 13:57.462
- ...three...
- Sound off like you've got a pair!

13:57.546 --> 13:59.464
Dad, l don't gotta put up with...

13:59.548 --> 14:02.092
You've got to at least try
and pace yourself.

14:02.176 --> 14:04.928
Otherwise, sure as shooting,
you're gonna burn out.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.306
Come.

14:08.182 --> 14:11.351
l heard the sad sigh,
l see your shoulders are slumped,

14:11.435 --> 14:13.812
and l'm aware that
you have some problem

14:13.896 --> 14:15.439
you want to talk to me about.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.901
You probably think it'll be
cathartic to get it off your chest,

14:18.984 --> 14:20.986
but believe me, it won't be.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.864
What you've got to do,
for me, is the healthy thing.

14:23.947 --> 14:28.368
Keep all of your feelings bottled up
inside where they so belong.

14:28.452 --> 14:31.121
My dad flaked on me again.

14:31.205 --> 14:34.291
l'm sorry. You're not
on drugs, are you?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.751
What? No.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.962
Are you in jail? Have you been beaten?
Are you malnourished?

14:39.046 --> 14:41.465
l skipped lunch,
but l've been snacking.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.718
You are, in fact, a perfectly
healthy 26-year-old doctor

14:44.801 --> 14:48.138
who keeps crying about
how horrible his father was.

14:48.222 --> 14:51.308
Well, he did some considerable
emotional damage, so...

14:51.391 --> 14:55.020
Every one of our parents does
considerable emotional damage,

14:55.103 --> 14:57.022
and from what l've heard,

14:57.105 --> 15:00.442
it just might be the best part
of being a parent.

15:00.526 --> 15:02.903
lf some guy ever does put
a ring on your finger,

15:02.986 --> 15:06.990
and you're lucky enough to pop out a
youngster, l'm sure you'll understand.

15:07.074 --> 15:10.619
But for now, trust me when
l tell you that l wouldn't care

15:10.702 --> 15:13.997
if today was the first time
you ever even met your daddy.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.209
Because in reality,

15:17.292 --> 15:20.128
well, he could've done
a much, much worse job.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.797
OK.

15:23.674 --> 15:26.093
All right, look, at the presentation,

15:26.176 --> 15:30.097
could l do the ending?
l really love the end of our paper.

15:30.180 --> 15:32.516
Do you think that l'm
cut out to be a doctor?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.768
OK, fine.
You can do the ending.

15:34.852 --> 15:37.521
l just want to say,
''Thanks, folks. We've been great.''

15:37.604 --> 15:41.191
l'm serious. Do you think this
is what l really want to do?

15:41.275 --> 15:43.277
Elliot, l don't know.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.404
You can tell me. l can take it.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.949
No, l'm saying ''l don't know''
because l really don't know.

15:49.032 --> 15:52.369
What the hell is going on here?

15:52.452 --> 15:54.454
Why have all women gone crazy?

15:56.248 --> 15:58.375
l'm not crazy. Am l?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.586
No. Shh.

16:00.669 --> 16:04.381
lt's OK, Elliot.
You're normal. You're normal.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.467
- Turk?
- He's not here.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.052
Turk.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.723
l do like that Cuban restaurant.

16:12.806 --> 16:16.476
l think the important thing
is that we got through this together.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.730
l'm freaked out because your mom
and l have lots in common.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.357
- So?
- l don't know.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.860
l got this crazy idea
that you only fell for me

16:24.943 --> 16:27.905
because l'm just like your mom.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.406
Baby...

16:31.491 --> 16:34.453
That's exactly why l fell for you.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.331
OK. l'll probably have
a friend pick up my stuff.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.000
Wait. Sit down.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.252
What's wrong with wanting someone

16:42.336 --> 16:46.131
because they're smart, independent
and always looking out for you?

16:48.592 --> 16:49.885
OK?

16:49.968 --> 16:55.766
Yeah. But if we ever get married, we'll
have to talk about this in therapy.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.977
Relax. l don't do this with my mama.

17:00.229 --> 17:02.189
l hope not.

17:03.899 --> 17:07.027
- Oh, yeah, Mama.
- Oh, that's just wrong.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.154
Oh, Mama.

17:10.531 --> 17:12.449
<i>Part of me
thought Cox was wrong.</i>

17:12.532 --> 17:14.701
<i>I had every reason
to be angry with my father.</i>

17:14.785 --> 17:17.204
So, how's it going down there?

17:17.287 --> 17:20.290
lf it's OK with you,
we just won't talk right now.

17:20.374 --> 17:23.126
Got a needle. Need to focus.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.503
<i>Then I stopped
thinking of my dad as a father</i>

17:25.587 --> 17:28.006
<i>and started thinking of him as a man.</i>

17:28.089 --> 17:32.302
<i>And I realised some things that
deep down I probably always knew.</i>

17:32.386 --> 17:36.390
<i>Like, maybe he wasn't crashing on my
couch to spend more quality time with me</i>

17:36.473 --> 17:39.184
<i>but because he couldn't
afford a hotel room.</i>

17:39.268 --> 17:42.396
<i>And maybe he wasn't going
to see his buddy Jake to catch up,</i>

17:42.479 --> 17:46.233
<i>but because Jake was someone
he might be able to sell something to,</i>

17:46.316 --> 17:48.652
<i>and he really needs a sale.</i>

17:48.735 --> 17:51.655
<i>Maybe the truth is he's
just a middle-aged, lonely guy</i>

17:51.738 --> 17:54.199
<i>struggling to get by,
and it sure would be nice</i>

17:54.283 --> 17:56.702
<i>if someone gave him
a break once in a while.</i>

17:56.785 --> 17:58.078
Hey, Dad.

17:58.162 --> 18:00.330
Hey, there he is.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.666
l thought you had to work all day.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.043
l did, but l got someone
to cover for me.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.963
l wanted to make sure
l caught you and let you know

18:08.046 --> 18:09.798
how cool it was to see you.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.384
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.553
Wow, l...

18:15.512 --> 18:18.140
Well, listen, l'm, you know,

18:18.223 --> 18:20.475
l have to travel a lot lately, so...

18:20.559 --> 18:24.438
...l'm sure l'll be back
in this region again soon.

18:24.521 --> 18:28.483
So l could swing back out
and see you.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.111
- That'd be great.
- Great.

18:31.195 --> 18:34.740
- Great.
- Great. l'd be happy to see you.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.158
Yeah, we could do that.

18:36.241 --> 18:39.036
You've been taking advantage
of the farting policy.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.288
Hey. Pull my finger.

18:41.371 --> 18:44.500
- l'm not gonna pull your finger.
- See what happens.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.295
l pooed a little.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.214
Dr Kelso.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.299
Well, if it isn't Daddy's little girl.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.468
l wanted to tell you
what happened to me.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.803
l'm going to keep eating my soup,

18:56.887 --> 18:59.932
but you rest assured
l'm holding my breath on the inside.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.601
First, l came out to my mother.

19:02.684 --> 19:03.769
Well, then,

19:03.852 --> 19:07.898
it appears the boys in radiology
owe me quite a bit of money.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.650
But this afternoon...

19:09.733 --> 19:12.569
<i>...a patient puked on me.</i>

19:12.653 --> 19:15.322
<i>And I smiled.</i>

19:15.405 --> 19:17.282
Do you know why l was smiling?

19:17.366 --> 19:19.243
Because l really like what l do.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.037
You were right. l got into this
for the wrong reasons.

19:22.120 --> 19:25.207
But now that l'm here, l can't
imagine being anywhere else.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.960
l still don't like your father.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.170
Oh, me neither, sir.

19:30.254 --> 19:33.549
Oh. They were all out.

19:36.426 --> 19:40.264
Placement of the stent in haemodynamic
results of PTA are inadequate.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.308
Or primary stent placement
at the initial time of PTA...

19:43.392 --> 19:46.937
<i>Maybe the mistake we make
is thinking our parents will change.</i>

19:47.020 --> 19:49.898
<i>And maybe they did a betterjob
than we give them credit for.</i>

19:49.982 --> 19:52.568
<i>Maybe there,
amid all the crap they dumped on us,</i>

19:52.651 --> 19:54.278
<i>are some things worth keeping.</i>

19:54.361 --> 19:57.030
<i>Like a passion for something
you never knew you had.</i>

19:57.114 --> 19:59.116
...recent trial of 283 patients...

19:59.199 --> 20:02.536
<i>Or the ability to surround
yourself with people who love you.</i>

20:02.619 --> 20:06.707
...subsequent stent placement
only increases... ln conclusion,

20:06.790 --> 20:09.293
the difference between the strategies

20:09.376 --> 20:13.672
is not significant at either
short-term or long-term follow-up.

20:13.755 --> 20:16.550
Thank you very much, folks,
we've been great.

20:29.104 --> 20:31.857
And ''Z'' is for the Zs
that you'll be getting

20:31.940 --> 20:35.235
cos you now know
heart murmurs from A to Z.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.905
Thank you.

20:40.991 --> 20:44.703
- What are you doing here?
- l just figured l'd come, check it out.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.289
You know, see how you're doing.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.416
And for the record,
that was atrocious.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.043
l mean, downright abysmal.

20:51.126 --> 20:53.045
l know, but did you
see A through K?

20:53.128 --> 20:55.047
l did a cool thing with A through K.

20:55.130 --> 20:58.133
l showed up at Y,
as in ''Why, dear God? Why?''

20:59.676 --> 21:01.637
You know, this has got to be

21:01.720 --> 21:04.348
the most piss-poor,
sorry excuse for a hospital

21:04.431 --> 21:06.642
that l have ever set foot in.

21:06.725 --> 21:10.896
Well, Dad, in that case, feel free
not to stop by every day you're in town.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.023
Goodbye, Son.

21:14.358 --> 21:16.527
l'll see you tomorrow.

21:16.610 --> 21:18.111
Yeah.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.949
Parents, huh?

21:22.032 --> 21:23.617
Tell me about it.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.119
Yeah. What's that,
a shot at my dad?

21:26.203 --> 21:28.121
That's stepping
over the line, pal.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.541
l missed this.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.293
Yeah.
