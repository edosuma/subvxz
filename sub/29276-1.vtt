00:18.950 --> 00:21.499
So you claim to categorically know

00:21.500 --> 00:23.199
that there is no afterlife.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.035
I base my believes

00:24.036 --> 00:26.559
on scientific evidence over many,

00:26.560 --> 00:29.909
many years of experiments
I conduct with my camera

00:29.910 --> 00:32.609
and the visual proof that my
three million followers get

00:32.610 --> 00:34.379
to see every week is more than enough

00:34.380 --> 00:37.429
to disprove your theories
of pooky afterlife...

00:37.430 --> 00:38.849
Three million followers,

00:38.850 --> 00:43.099
80% of the people on this earth
have faith and have belief.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.349
80% of people
on this earth have fear

00:45.350 --> 00:46.769
because of all the nonsense start as

00:46.770 --> 00:47.909
them, are people like you.

00:47.910 --> 00:49.849
You arrogant young man.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.269
You are the arrogant
pompous old prick, mate

00:52.270 --> 00:53.127
and try to tell me how to do my job.

00:53.128 --> 00:54.842
Okay, now you just insult me.

00:54.843 --> 00:58.099
You are not talking issues here,
you are not talking belief.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.769
And I'm a man of
science and reality and realism.

01:01.770 --> 01:05.149
In which case
science requires proof.

01:05.150 --> 01:07.539
You can't prove this.

01:07.540 --> 01:10.969
Now look, the only way you
could irrefutable prove it,

01:10.970 --> 01:15.079
would be for yourself to
die and then resurrect again

01:15.080 --> 01:17.229
and I'm sure as heaven and hell that

01:17.230 --> 01:18.927
that won't be happening will it?

02:51.480 --> 02:53.860
Wow, look at that.

02:55.280 --> 02:56.379
What do you think, kiddo?

02:56.380 --> 02:57.473
It's great.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.699
Hey, do you
know how to put up a tent?

03:00.700 --> 03:03.699
How about you
show me and I film you?

03:03.700 --> 03:06.059
Ha-ha, nice try.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.109
You're not getting out of this one kiddo.

03:08.110 --> 03:09.479
Uncle Frank,
you're a slave driver.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.317
Yeah, yeah stop your whining.

03:11.318 --> 03:12.959
Always worth a shot.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.099
Think there are any aliens out there?

03:32.100 --> 03:33.666
Well if there are, we
never wanna meet them.

03:33.667 --> 03:34.500
Why?

03:34.501 --> 03:35.819
Be's if they can find us,

03:35.820 --> 03:37.262
that means that they're super intelligent

03:37.263 --> 03:38.559
and you know what that means?

03:38.560 --> 03:39.609
What?

03:39.610 --> 03:40.610
Armageddon.

03:41.770 --> 03:43.009
Think about it.

03:43.010 --> 03:45.999
Those aliens got big guns,
you've seen the movies, right?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.203
Big guns, big heads, shiny coats.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.013
Uncle Frank.
Yeah.

03:52.940 --> 03:54.959
Can you prove that God doesn't exist?

03:54.960 --> 03:56.729
No one's ever proven
that God does exist,

03:56.730 --> 03:59.809
so I don't see the point.

03:59.810 --> 04:00.919
And you know what else?

04:00.920 --> 04:01.753
What?

04:01.754 --> 04:03.179
No one ever will prove that God exist

04:03.180 --> 04:04.380
so don't worry about it.

04:05.449 --> 04:07.332
What about ghosts?

04:07.333 --> 04:10.099
Ghosts, where did you hear about ghost?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.629
Well, I mean I've seen
lots of ghosts on YouTube.

04:12.630 --> 04:13.999
YouTube?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.699
It's like the number one
hangout for fraudsters.

04:16.700 --> 04:19.399
Don't believe any of the
stuff you see on there.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.809
You see now, if you believe in ghosts.

04:33.810 --> 04:34.969
Maybe I'd say that that's a ghost

04:34.970 --> 04:37.913
but I guarantee you that is a koala.

04:40.770 --> 04:42.929
None of that stuff, God,
paranormal activity,

04:42.930 --> 04:45.303
it's all fake Daniel, you
don't have to believe it.

04:47.206 --> 04:48.717
Are you tired?

04:48.718 --> 04:50.699
Me too.
So tired.

04:50.700 --> 04:51.879
Let's go.
Let's go to bed.

04:51.880 --> 04:52.880
Bed time.

04:57.159 --> 04:59.479
And don't forget to set up
that camera, okay on the dash.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.630
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

05:12.450 --> 05:13.450
Check this.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.589
Baa!

05:19.020 --> 05:21.059
You scared, you warmed
for the night, Buddy.

05:21.060 --> 05:22.114
Okay.

05:45.409 --> 05:48.319
There's something outside.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.750
It's nothing, Daniel.

05:51.950 --> 05:53.367
Go back to sleep.

06:13.295 --> 06:14.128
Uncle Frank.

06:14.129 --> 06:15.878
Ah for Christ sake.

06:17.890 --> 06:18.890
Fine.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.267
I'm telling you there's nothing.

06:49.049 --> 06:50.644
It's nothing.

06:50.645 --> 06:52.024
Probably just a kangaroo.

06:56.251 --> 06:58.004
But uncle Frank, I'm scared.

06:58.005 --> 06:59.613
No I don't wanna hear anymore, okay.

06:59.614 --> 07:01.031
Go back to sleep.

07:27.851 --> 07:29.170
Look.

07:29.171 --> 07:30.338
Get out.

07:32.458 --> 07:33.693
Stay here.

07:37.110 --> 07:38.543
Hey, who's there?

07:39.400 --> 07:41.203
Come on show yourself you pranksters.

07:43.730 --> 07:44.608
Daniel, get in the car.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.110
Keep still.

08:00.300 --> 08:01.133
Uncle Frank.

08:01.133 --> 08:02.131
Yeah.

08:02.132 --> 08:03.493
I wanna go home.

08:04.950 --> 08:07.949
When I find the son of
a bitch that's doing this.

08:07.950 --> 08:09.249
That was a ghost.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.083
That was proof.

08:10.084 --> 08:11.599
Don't be ridiculous.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.956
Daniel, we will make a
atheist out of you one day.

08:15.540 --> 08:16.387
You have nothing to worry about, okay.

08:16.388 --> 08:17.959
I'm telling you, this is just pranksters.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.643
They wanna through me off the trail okay.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.663
Yeah, all right gimme that camera.

08:25.550 --> 08:27.043
Let's have a look at the footage.

08:28.370 --> 08:29.979
What's going on?

08:29.980 --> 08:31.719
Shit, it didn't record.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.673
I did, I did.

08:32.673 --> 08:33.506
Daniel, what did I say?

08:33.506 --> 08:34.990
I did record.

08:34.991 --> 08:38.110
I pressed the button, please I promise.

08:41.740 --> 08:43.890
All right, I'm gonna
set the camera here.

08:44.780 --> 08:46.129
We'll spend the night in the car

08:46.130 --> 08:48.311
and if anything happens
we will see it, okay.

08:48.312 --> 08:49.395
Yeah, okay.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.530
Yellow.

09:14.530 --> 09:15.363
Frank, where are you?

09:15.364 --> 09:17.309
I need you here yesterday.

09:17.310 --> 09:18.509
What's happened?

09:18.510 --> 09:21.172
I've had a major
breakthrough and I mean major.

09:21.173 --> 09:22.919
When can you be here?

09:22.920 --> 09:24.399
About three hours.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.233
Don't be late.

09:25.233 --> 09:26.233
Okay, all right.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.579
All right, orders away, let's go.

09:29.580 --> 09:30.580
Uncle Frank.

09:33.020 --> 09:35.719
Nothing Daniel, it's just bug bites.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.553
That's what happens when you camp.

09:36.554 --> 09:38.649
There's all kinds of
creepy crawlies out there.

09:38.650 --> 09:40.069
Look, I've got bug bites too.

09:40.070 --> 09:41.070
All of me.

09:44.957 --> 09:46.059
Can we just get out of here?

09:46.060 --> 09:47.060
Yeah.

10:17.988 --> 10:20.659
Well, well only 30 minutes late,

10:20.660 --> 10:21.809
you're getting better.

10:21.810 --> 10:23.179
Yeah, blow me Clint.

10:23.180 --> 10:24.879
You wanna know something,
you're gonna lose your job

10:24.880 --> 10:26.939
Hello man, how do you
work for this loser?

10:26.940 --> 10:29.249
I don't, he takes direction from me.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.683
Keep the telling a lie.

10:31.670 --> 10:33.539
What are we doing here?

10:33.540 --> 10:35.009
Some kind of breakthrough.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.349
Hey three amigos,

10:36.350 --> 10:38.900
think you could join me
inside some time this year.

10:40.643 --> 10:42.560
Ariba, ariba.

10:45.571 --> 10:48.925
Okay, everyone agree we
have one healthy guinea pig.

10:48.926 --> 10:49.759
Yeah, sure.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.459
Yep.

10:51.460 --> 10:52.378
Show time.

10:54.754 --> 10:57.441
Death will occur in 10 seconds.

10:57.442 --> 10:59.775
10, nine, eight, seven, six,

11:02.480 --> 11:06.430
five, four, three, two, one,

11:07.650 --> 11:11.790
zero decease now,
decease now, decease now.

11:17.184 --> 11:18.819
Subject is deceased.

11:18.820 --> 11:21.569
Okay, so you euthanized the guinea pig.

11:21.570 --> 11:23.176
Einstein would be very proud.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.293
Okay, patience 10 minutes.

11:28.430 --> 11:29.709
Want a quickie?

11:29.710 --> 11:31.609
Seriously, Daniel.

11:31.610 --> 11:33.257
What's a quickie?

11:33.258 --> 11:36.679
You know, when you have ice
cream in between your meal.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.830
Okay let's
concentrate, shall we?

11:41.660 --> 11:44.143
Yep, one dead guinea pig.

11:52.190 --> 11:55.229
Resurrection
will occur in 10 seconds.

11:55.230 --> 11:56.429
Okay boys, you ready?

11:56.430 --> 11:57.942
Yeah sure, let's do this...

11:57.943 --> 12:03.670
10, nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four,

12:05.356 --> 12:07.189
three, two, one, zero.

12:10.056 --> 12:12.305
Resurrect now,

12:14.294 --> 12:17.654
the subject has been resurrected.

12:20.318 --> 12:21.151
One healthy guinea pig.

12:21.152 --> 12:23.169
The subject has been revived.

12:23.170 --> 12:24.499
How many times have this worked?

12:24.500 --> 12:27.409
Like eight times, I've
even bought one back after

12:27.410 --> 12:28.757
an hour of death.

12:28.758 --> 12:30.199
Any side effects?

12:30.200 --> 12:31.146
None.

12:35.779 --> 12:37.519
You recon you can do this on a human?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.809
What do you think a human guinea pig?

12:39.810 --> 12:41.142
Daniel, you wanna have a go?

12:41.143 --> 12:42.811
No thanks, miss McKenna.

12:42.812 --> 12:44.199
Just kidding.

12:44.200 --> 12:45.140
No, I'm serious.

12:45.141 --> 12:48.669
What if we could actually
do this on a person.

12:48.670 --> 12:50.029
Kill them and bring them back to life.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.579
We'd finally have
definitive scientific proof

12:52.580 --> 12:55.119
that there is no
afterlife, no God, nothing.

12:55.120 --> 12:55.953
Yeah, yeah I recon we could have

12:55.954 --> 12:57.889
a 100 000 people watching live.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.529
Hey, we can have a
million watching live,

12:59.530 --> 13:00.599
this would be huge.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.299
And we will be the
biggest vlog in the world,

13:02.300 --> 13:03.614
everyone would know us.
I can believe this.

13:03.615 --> 13:08.379
Stop, stop I'm not gonna kill somebody.

13:08.380 --> 13:09.509
You wouldn't have to kill anyone

13:09.510 --> 13:11.209
because you would be
bringing them back to life,

13:11.210 --> 13:12.043
Hello, Clint speaking.

13:12.043 --> 13:12.923
That's the point.

13:12.924 --> 13:17.109
Hey listen, I gotta go take
Daniel back to his mom's place

13:17.110 --> 13:19.469
but maybe we could talk
about this later at my place.

13:19.470 --> 13:20.368
Maybe.

13:20.369 --> 13:22.612
Over ice cream?

13:22.613 --> 13:24.529
You not gonna believe who just called.

13:24.530 --> 13:25.366
Who?

13:25.367 --> 13:27.039
number one target.

13:27.040 --> 13:27.873
Who?

13:27.874 --> 13:29.774
Meredith Palin.

13:29.775 --> 13:30.775
Where?

13:31.490 --> 13:33.193
Her place, tomorrow in Ralston.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.819
Why would she
let us slaughter her?

13:36.820 --> 13:37.653
Who cares?

13:37.653 --> 13:38.530
Daniel, we gotta go.

13:38.531 --> 13:40.687
Baby, amazing, thank you.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.505
Come on, let's go.

13:43.506 --> 13:44.506
Bye.

13:47.179 --> 13:49.843
Hey, best not tell your mom
about what happened, okay.

13:51.940 --> 13:53.379
Hey Sis.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.830
Go inside Daniel, I need
to talk to your uncle.

13:56.870 --> 13:57.999
See you uncle Frank.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.039
We'll go in free next week.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.611
Yeah, cool.

14:00.612 --> 14:01.819
Hi.

14:01.820 --> 14:04.269
You were suppose to
take him for the weekend.

14:04.270 --> 14:06.109
Ah, you know kids, science experience,

14:06.110 --> 14:07.132
not his kind of thing.

14:07.133 --> 14:09.149
I've got company tonight.

14:09.150 --> 14:10.356
A date?

14:10.357 --> 14:11.459
Reckon you'd get lucky?

14:11.460 --> 14:12.789
Yeah well, I would have

14:12.790 --> 14:14.349
if you kept your end of the bargain.

14:14.350 --> 14:16.650
I'll take him
again soon, I promise.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.030
Baby,

14:29.310 --> 14:30.891
I wanna do it.

14:30.892 --> 14:32.137
We are.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.138
No,

14:34.470 --> 14:36.049
you're experiment.

14:36.050 --> 14:37.729
I wanna crossover to the other side.

14:37.730 --> 14:41.530
Frank, I'm not risking my
career, or your life on it.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.800
Oh no wait, listen to me.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.570
I wanna die for one hour

14:51.936 --> 14:52.931
and be revived.

14:52.931 --> 14:53.764
You're kidding, right?

14:53.765 --> 14:54.924
No.

14:54.925 --> 14:56.129
Frank, don't be ridiculous.

14:56.130 --> 14:58.199
Come on Babe, think about it.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.968
Definitive, scientific proof
Oh Jesus, Frank.

14:59.969 --> 15:01.369
That there is no afterlife.

15:01.370 --> 15:02.203
Are you serious?
There is no God.

15:02.203 --> 15:03.036
Where you're going, come on.

15:03.037 --> 15:05.579
Hey listen, thought you
were gonna stay the night.

15:05.580 --> 15:07.430
No, it's too hard to get laid here.

15:09.096 --> 15:10.392
See you later.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.723
Yeah, all right.

15:18.260 --> 15:20.699
Somebody's got to be the first.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.999
This is Frank Benetti
from scepticsbust.com.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.139
Today I'm going to interview Australia's

15:25.140 --> 15:27.919
most well known medium and
spiritual TV personality.

15:27.920 --> 15:29.239
Her name is Meredith Palin.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.889
Now Meredith claims that
she can speak to spirits

15:31.890 --> 15:34.449
from beyond the grave and wait for this,

15:34.450 --> 15:37.239
astral travel through astral planes.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.479
She sounds like a total cook,

15:38.480 --> 15:40.449
I can't wait to interview this one,

15:40.450 --> 15:41.779
let's bust her.

15:43.660 --> 15:45.879
So tell us Meredith, little
bit about what you do

15:45.880 --> 15:47.209
and how you do it.

15:47.210 --> 15:50.009
On the other side, I can
visit different dimensions

15:50.010 --> 15:52.609
such as the astral plane
and other higher planes.

15:52.610 --> 15:55.969
Who do you meet when your
on these other dimensions?

15:55.970 --> 15:57.429
Many different souls and beings.

15:57.430 --> 15:58.263
Oh, really?

15:58.264 --> 16:00.629
My personal favorite would
have to be the lightbeings.

16:00.630 --> 16:01.463
Oh really.

16:01.464 --> 16:05.179
Yeah, they're pure form of
loving angelic consciousness.

16:05.180 --> 16:07.252
How do you spelt such utter nonsense,

16:07.253 --> 16:09.079
keeping a straight face?

16:09.080 --> 16:09.930
I don't know how you do it.

16:09.931 --> 16:11.649
I don't think you're
taking this seriously.

16:11.650 --> 16:12.560
Okay, you're right.

16:12.560 --> 16:13.393
I'm not taking this seriously

16:13.394 --> 16:15.479
but I'm actually very excited to be here

16:15.480 --> 16:17.699
because I love talking to mediums.

16:17.700 --> 16:21.049
I find you fascinating
so I'm very impressed.

16:21.050 --> 16:22.950
How do you feel about lying to people?

16:25.020 --> 16:27.269
Question five, how do
you live with yourself,

16:27.270 --> 16:28.899
taking money from gullible people?

16:28.900 --> 16:31.669
Question six, when are you going to admit

16:31.670 --> 16:33.363
that what you do is wrong?

16:34.310 --> 16:36.510
Honestly Frank, you can
do better than this.

16:43.030 --> 16:44.669
Very funny, Meredith.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.493
Can I have my questions back please?

16:51.040 --> 16:53.119
Why did you camp in the
Glen Davis Ghost Town?

16:53.120 --> 16:56.039
So you followed us, so
much for psychic powers.

16:56.040 --> 16:58.179
You pissed off a lot of dead miners.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.349
Very disrespectful.

16:59.350 --> 17:01.359
It was you, playing
hocus pocus in the middle

17:01.360 --> 17:02.340
of the night, I knew it.

17:02.341 --> 17:04.219
Now let me tell you something, lady.

17:04.220 --> 17:05.378
I bet you think that was really funny

17:05.380 --> 17:06.608
except I had my nephew with me

17:06.609 --> 17:07.819
and you scared him half to death.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.469
Frank, they wanted me to warn you.

17:09.470 --> 17:11.096
They wanted you to warn me.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.019
Are you getting this,
this is fucking hilarious.

17:15.020 --> 17:19.279
Frank Benetti, you're going
to listen to me right now.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.979
They wanted me to warn you.

17:20.980 --> 17:24.929
If you do your little death
stunt which you're planning,

17:24.930 --> 17:26.534
you're going to bring trouble.

17:31.011 --> 17:33.553
Don't do it, do it, do it.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.520
This interview is over.

17:43.590 --> 17:45.939
Shut the cameras off, let's go.

17:45.940 --> 17:46.800
Frank.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.633
Let's go.

17:47.634 --> 17:48.979
Frank.

18:25.820 --> 18:27.003
Yeah.

18:27.004 --> 18:28.959
Our sign full
immunity contracts for Clinton

18:28.960 --> 18:31.319
and I, you've gotta administer
the chemicals yourself.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.763
Sure, I can do that.

18:34.966 --> 18:36.469
It's gotta be hell and we know.

18:36.470 --> 18:38.073
You're certifiably insane.

18:39.630 --> 18:42.596
But if this experiments
succeeds, Whines wins.

18:42.597 --> 18:43.782
Okay, I'm recording this conversation

18:43.783 --> 18:44.909
and I wanna go on the record

18:44.910 --> 18:46.729
as having advised you against this.

19:10.796 --> 19:12.399
Happy Halloween, ladies and gentlemen.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.329
Tonight we welcome the one and only,

19:14.330 --> 19:17.513
the dead man walking, Frank Benetti.

19:22.090 --> 19:26.549
Tonight I, Frank Benetti,
will tell you exactly

19:26.550 --> 19:28.513
what happens when you die.

19:29.660 --> 19:34.660
So tell your friends because
in exactly 30 minutes,

19:35.130 --> 19:38.609
I will lethally inject myself right here

19:38.610 --> 19:39.919
on scepticsbust.com.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.923
Sound cut, perfect.

19:43.633 --> 19:46.219
Yo mate, come on.

19:46.220 --> 19:48.379
Ah, let's get the shot of the timer.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.290
There, is this good?

19:49.291 --> 19:50.378
Yeah, yeah it's good.

19:50.379 --> 19:51.463
Yes.

20:02.433 --> 20:04.219
You're sure you can
bring me back, right?

20:04.220 --> 20:06.989
Haven't done it on a human
before, you're the test pilot.

20:06.990 --> 20:10.510
Sarah, I really need
some confidence right now.

20:14.710 --> 20:18.269
Calculations and
projections say it will work.

20:18.270 --> 20:19.270
You will be revived.

20:20.943 --> 20:21.931
Okay.

20:27.070 --> 20:28.270
What's the latest Megan?

20:31.860 --> 20:34.009
Five million watching.

20:34.010 --> 20:36.073
Five million, holy shit.

21:02.770 --> 21:05.649
Megan, how're those stat coming along?

21:05.650 --> 21:08.689
Right now, we have 13
million people watching.

21:08.690 --> 21:09.523
Wow, that's amazing.

21:09.524 --> 21:10.713
Jesus, guys.

21:13.196 --> 21:15.041
Okay, let's go I'm ready.

21:17.210 --> 21:19.360
This is gonna make
you so fucking famous.

21:20.330 --> 21:21.943
All right, back to broadcasting.

21:23.080 --> 21:26.573
Five, four, three, two.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.799
Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.363
My name is Frank Benetti,
I'm 29 years old.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.113
As you can see, my time is up.

21:37.813 --> 21:39.063
Enjoy the show.

22:18.342 --> 22:19.425
Bon voyage.

22:26.761 --> 22:29.132
Death will occur in 10 seconds.

22:31.226 --> 22:34.643
10, nine, eight, seven, six,

22:36.609 --> 22:38.109
five, four, three.

22:41.076 --> 22:44.409
Two, one, zero decease now, decease now.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.349
Subject is deceased.

23:20.350 --> 23:21.633
Decease complete.

23:22.870 --> 23:25.643
Subject is deceased, decease complete.

23:38.370 --> 23:40.669
Frank Benneti is officially deceased.

23:40.670 --> 23:44.879
Death occurred at 10:01p.m.
on the 31st of October.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.703
Cause, self inflicted lethal injection.

24:03.581 --> 24:08.581
In 15 seconds we will resurrect
Frank Benneti from the dead.

24:11.367 --> 24:14.060
Three, two, one, zero.

24:16.301 --> 24:20.141
Resurrect now, resurrect now,

24:20.142 --> 24:20.975
resurrect now.

24:40.380 --> 24:41.582
Shouldn't
this have worked by now?

24:41.583 --> 24:42.809
Yeah, well it's taking
a little bit longer

24:42.810 --> 24:44.683
than the guinea pigs.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.222
Resurrection has failed,

24:47.223 --> 24:49.405
subject is still deceased.

24:49.406 --> 24:51.464
Get the defibrillator!

25:00.251 --> 25:01.251
Clear.

25:02.535 --> 25:03.493
Come on, Frank.

25:11.705 --> 25:13.288
It's not working.

25:28.843 --> 25:30.289
He's dead,
he's like totally dead.

25:30.290 --> 25:32.379
Well stop stating the fucking obvious.

25:32.380 --> 25:33.779
Those papers he signed better cover us,

25:33.780 --> 25:35.130
I'm not gonna fuck in jail.

25:36.690 --> 25:38.069
Uncle Frank, please come back.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.229
Wake up, come on uncle
Frank you can do it.

25:40.230 --> 25:42.132
Just come back, please
you promised me it...

25:47.903 --> 25:48.736
O, my God.

25:48.737 --> 25:50.053
Subject has been revived,

25:51.410 --> 25:52.663
subject has been revived.

25:57.344 --> 26:00.649
It's working, it's finally working.

26:00.650 --> 26:02.500
Where are those lights coming from?

26:03.353 --> 26:04.953
Such a weird response.

26:05.950 --> 26:06.791
Are you getting this.

26:06.791 --> 26:07.624
Of course I'm getting this.

26:07.625 --> 26:08.961
This is fucking amazing.

26:13.755 --> 26:15.700
Welcome back stranger.

26:15.701 --> 26:19.542
How long was I gone?

26:19.543 --> 26:21.169
An hour three.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.980
Nice to see you again uncle Frank.

26:27.180 --> 26:30.012
So everyone wants to know,

26:30.013 --> 26:32.419
what did you see in afterlife?

26:32.420 --> 26:34.170
Absolutely nothing.

26:36.258 --> 26:39.929
And what did it feel like to die?

26:39.930 --> 26:42.393
I felt the chemicals
going through my body

26:45.248 --> 26:46.665
and then nothing.

26:50.417 --> 26:52.599
Can I help you officers?

26:52.600 --> 26:53.750
Whose in charge here?

26:55.100 --> 26:56.100
I am.

26:59.828 --> 27:00.828
I am.

27:44.333 --> 27:46.619
Hell of a stunt you pulled off tonight.

27:46.620 --> 27:48.569
Had our switchboard in meltdown.

27:48.570 --> 27:50.719
Wasting police resources
on bullshit like this

27:50.720 --> 27:54.359
and on our busiest night, not fun.

27:54.360 --> 27:55.759
I was proving a point all right

27:55.760 --> 27:58.069
and now you and I both know
that there is no afterlife

27:58.070 --> 27:59.759
and there is no life after death.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.829
All those religious quacks
and all those new age weirdos,

28:02.830 --> 28:05.389
they gonna go out of
business, thanks to me.

28:05.390 --> 28:06.809
Can we stop with all the bullshit.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.199
We all know it's all pretend.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.529
Geez, why would I pretend
if I'm from scepticsbusts.com

28:10.530 --> 28:11.510
for God's sake.

28:11.511 --> 28:13.710
Sarah has all ready
told us it was a hoax.

28:14.800 --> 28:15.939
Sarah wouldn't do that.

28:15.940 --> 28:16.940
She did.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.669
Frank Benetti, we are
charging you and your partner,

28:21.670 --> 28:23.869
Sarah McKenna, with public mischief.

28:23.870 --> 28:25.069
Public mischief?

28:25.070 --> 28:28.489
Wasting police resources
on hoaxes like this.

28:28.490 --> 28:29.770
Do you understand your rights?

28:36.420 --> 28:38.173
Who the hell was that?

28:39.590 --> 28:41.453
No geez, we have a wild one here.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.263
Can we go get breakfast?

29:03.160 --> 29:04.509
Sarah, why did you
tell them it was a hoax?

29:04.510 --> 29:06.159
If I hadn't we'd be
in a lot more trouble.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.113
But don't you see that makes me look

29:07.114 --> 29:09.999
like a complete fake, a fraudster.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.759
It's over every news
outlet in the world.

29:12.760 --> 29:13.593
Yeah, until they find out

29:13.594 --> 29:14.829
it's all a complete hoax according

29:14.830 --> 29:16.248
to the chief architect, Sarah McKenna.

29:16.249 --> 29:17.319
Okay, can you just let it calm down

29:17.320 --> 29:19.259
with the police, please.

29:19.260 --> 29:21.160
Then we'll show everyone the evidence.

29:22.750 --> 29:23.701
Sarah, I've been seeing things

29:23.702 --> 29:26.299
that just don't make any sense.

29:26.300 --> 29:27.439
Like hallucinations?

29:27.440 --> 29:28.743
Yeah, exactly.

29:30.170 --> 29:31.520
What do you think it means?

29:33.459 --> 29:35.269
You might get them for a couple of days.

29:35.270 --> 29:36.318
Just as the chemicals...

29:36.319 --> 29:37.919
And now you tell me.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.149
Okay, you know, I was
the one who told you

29:39.150 --> 29:40.850
in the first place not to do this.

29:41.933 --> 29:42.933
You need to rest.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.450
Couple of days, you'll be good as gold.

29:53.350 --> 29:54.870
I'll come over tomorrow.

30:04.029 --> 30:06.872
Clint, slow down mate I can't understand

30:06.873 --> 30:07.873
what you're saying.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.360
All right, look I'll be over
at seven p.m. tonight okay?

30:38.130 --> 30:40.449
You're on the blacklist.

30:40.450 --> 30:42.469
What, Kathryn?

30:42.470 --> 30:44.009
I'm just teaching him about science, okay.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.919
He witnessed a really important
experiment last night.

30:46.920 --> 30:47.900
No more camping trips,

30:47.901 --> 30:49.650
no more science lessons, okay.

30:49.651 --> 30:50.966
Don't be like that Kathryn, okay.

30:50.967 --> 30:52.949
The kid is almost 14 years old.

30:52.950 --> 30:54.619
When are you gonna let
him grow up and be a man?

30:54.620 --> 30:58.559
He's sick, he's
vomiting, he's not himself.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.530
I just have one request.

30:59.531 --> 31:02.039
I really need his video footage.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.679
He's asked me to ban you from the house.

31:03.680 --> 31:04.560
Ban?

31:04.561 --> 31:05.849
And so have I.

31:05.850 --> 31:07.629
Kathryn, please I need
to see his video footage.

31:07.630 --> 31:09.810
It's really important.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.449
Right, what do you got for me?

31:58.450 --> 31:59.873
All right, check this out.

32:02.090 --> 32:03.386
It's freaky, right.

32:05.287 --> 32:06.552
Do you know who that is?

32:06.553 --> 32:07.520
I don't know.

32:07.521 --> 32:09.359
As from the whole time I
didn't see a single thing.

32:09.360 --> 32:10.461
And you never saw any one come in?

32:10.462 --> 32:11.839
I didn't see a single thing, no.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.899
We're all there.

32:12.900 --> 32:13.733
Locked the doors, right?

32:13.733 --> 32:14.733
Of course.

32:16.350 --> 32:18.225
Somebody is playing us.

32:37.345 --> 32:41.716
You have the power to heal.

32:42.618 --> 32:46.533
Hey Frank,
Frank what's the matter?

32:48.820 --> 32:49.820
Frank!

32:51.050 --> 32:52.311
What's up, man?

32:52.312 --> 32:54.423
Nothing, nothing.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.848
Yeah, I'll catch you later.

32:58.849 --> 33:00.154
All right.

34:01.019 --> 34:02.109
You had to be scared.

34:02.110 --> 34:04.359
You know three managers
before you died for me

34:04.360 --> 34:05.206
from poisoned food.

34:05.207 --> 34:06.529
This food
doesn't make any more poison

34:06.530 --> 34:07.869
than any other hotel food.

34:07.870 --> 34:09.569
Gimme that.

34:09.570 --> 34:10.402
Oh no Boss,

34:10.404 --> 34:11.558
look you gotta have
somebody that test the food.

34:12.391 --> 34:13.225
What you need is a guinea pig.

34:13.226 --> 34:14.603
You eat the guinea
pig, I'll stick to this.

34:50.080 --> 34:54.080
Hey Boss wait,
don't touch it, don't!

34:55.407 --> 34:59.093
I just wanted to
take a little shot, that's all.

35:53.073 --> 35:54.079
Since my death,

35:54.080 --> 35:57.409
I've been experiencing
intense paranormal activity

35:57.410 --> 36:01.870
as you can see,
this is not fake

36:01.871 --> 36:04.573
this is not hallucination, this is real.

36:34.370 --> 36:35.310
What's up?

36:35.311 --> 36:37.549
Sarah, I gotta stay at
your place tonight, okay.

36:37.550 --> 36:38.833
I'm on my way.

36:41.980 --> 36:43.086
What do you think?

36:43.087 --> 36:44.489
Meredith.

36:44.490 --> 36:45.819
It's obviously her.

36:45.820 --> 36:47.149
What would she got to do with it?

36:47.150 --> 36:49.049
Oh come on, think about the interview.

36:49.050 --> 36:50.539
She's a highly skilled trickster.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.869
This is more than tricks
and hallucinations, Sarah.

36:52.870 --> 36:54.239
This is real, I experienced this.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.569
She is your spook, Frank.

36:56.570 --> 36:57.570
I'm telling you.

36:59.810 --> 37:03.383
Something is stalking
me and I need your help.

37:04.600 --> 37:05.600
Something?

37:07.080 --> 37:08.730
You know what I mean.

37:11.100 --> 37:13.200
I'm sorry I let you do this to yourself.

37:14.270 --> 37:15.493
We need to get you help.

37:16.830 --> 37:19.079
What if we were wrong, Sarah.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.430
About everything.

37:22.524 --> 37:23.759
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.

37:23.760 --> 37:26.589
But if something
happened to me, didn't it?

37:26.590 --> 37:27.633
After I died.

37:30.510 --> 37:31.960
You can sleep on the couch.

37:32.850 --> 37:33.850
Good night.

38:20.787 --> 38:21.787
What?

38:26.390 --> 38:27.390
That's weird.

38:36.852 --> 38:38.289
What's up?

38:38.290 --> 38:39.989
Hey Clint, listen.

38:39.990 --> 38:42.759
I'm having some trouble
getting into the website.

38:42.760 --> 38:44.853
Sarah asked me
to change the password.

38:46.070 --> 38:47.569
Sarah asked you.

38:47.570 --> 38:48.490
Did she say why?

38:48.491 --> 38:50.824
Sarah, is the major
shareholder in the company.

38:50.825 --> 38:54.037
She owns scepticsbust.com
and she wants you out.

38:55.230 --> 38:56.063
What are you talking about,

38:56.063 --> 38:56.896
I'm the front man.

38:56.896 --> 38:57.740
There is no blog without me.

38:57.741 --> 38:58.759
You're fired.

38:58.760 --> 38:59.660
Read the new post.

38:59.661 --> 39:00.999
What new post?

39:01.000 --> 39:02.009
Clint!

39:02.010 --> 39:03.010
Hey, Clint.

39:07.890 --> 39:09.893
Sarah McKenna, your new presenter.

39:12.540 --> 39:15.319
Frank Benetti will be taking
an extended leave of absence

39:15.320 --> 39:16.449
to rest and recuperate

39:16.450 --> 39:18.949
from his recent death experiment hoax.

39:18.950 --> 39:20.559
We wish him well.

39:20.560 --> 39:23.133
I, Sarah McKenna, will
be your new presenter.

39:24.040 --> 39:25.489
More of the same,

39:25.490 --> 39:27.449
busting the cooks who
trick you in believing

39:27.450 --> 39:30.729
in their psychic ability
and paranormal activity.

39:30.730 --> 39:32.433
This is scepticsbust.com.

39:34.752 --> 39:36.113
Unbelievable.

39:39.991 --> 39:41.403
Sarah, it's Frank.

39:42.330 --> 39:43.260
Don't hang up, Sarah.

39:43.260 --> 39:44.260
Sarah!

39:52.533 --> 39:53.533
Oh, come on.

39:57.142 --> 39:58.660
What the hell?

40:25.908 --> 40:26.908
Hello?

42:30.057 --> 42:31.640
Meredith, Meredith.

42:43.292 --> 42:44.709
I really need your help.

42:44.710 --> 42:45.905
I'm busy, I'll meet you in there.

42:45.906 --> 42:47.939
Meredith please, I really,
really need your help.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.819
I will meet you in the other room.

42:50.820 --> 42:52.409
Sorry love, did you want to take those?

42:52.410 --> 42:53.243
Yes, thanks.

42:53.244 --> 42:54.329
Of course, would you like a bag?

42:54.330 --> 42:55.330
Yes, please.

43:20.030 --> 43:22.923
Life on the other
side by Meredith Palin.

43:27.145 --> 43:28.679
Jesus Christ, Meredith.

43:28.680 --> 43:31.530
Can you just walk into a room
like everyone else, please.

43:32.770 --> 43:34.259
Something happened to
me in our last meeting.

43:34.260 --> 43:36.529
Something that I've never felt before.

43:36.530 --> 43:38.699
Well, they do say that opposites attract

43:38.700 --> 43:40.539
but don't get any ideas.

43:40.540 --> 43:43.999
No, it started when you
grabbed my arm, Meredith.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.963
I have three date minimum
rule and I'm into Kamasutra.

43:48.580 --> 43:50.899
No, look just stop just stop okay.

43:50.900 --> 43:52.669
Something is following me, some kind of,

43:52.670 --> 43:55.133
I don't know, entity is following me.

43:56.010 --> 43:57.371
Well, you're now under
my protection as long

43:57.372 --> 43:58.667
as you're near me.

43:58.668 --> 44:00.069
First I thought it was hallucinations,

44:00.070 --> 44:01.047
I don't know quite how to
explain it to you but...

44:01.048 --> 44:03.179
Come on, I'll shut the shop.

44:03.180 --> 44:04.330
Are you coming?

44:09.860 --> 44:10.959
Okay, now I'm very impressed

44:10.960 --> 44:12.469
but can we get to the point please?

44:12.470 --> 44:14.499
You and Sarah had fun.

44:14.500 --> 44:16.639
Oh and date night, very naughty, Frank.

44:16.640 --> 44:18.999
Okay, that's enough of that, just stop.

44:19.000 --> 44:20.450
Can we stick on topic please.

44:21.650 --> 44:22.650
So?

44:23.750 --> 44:25.099
Well, do you want the bad news first

44:25.100 --> 44:27.123
and then the bad news?

44:27.124 --> 44:28.689
Yeah, I love bad news.

44:28.690 --> 44:30.299
Hit me.

44:30.300 --> 44:31.439
Traveling to the astral plane

44:31.440 --> 44:34.339
with your little death stunt
was a really, really bad idea.

44:34.340 --> 44:35.609
How was I suppose to know?

44:35.610 --> 44:37.579
I specifically warned you.

44:37.580 --> 44:39.263
All right, I know you did.

44:41.712 --> 44:42.545
What do you want me to do?

44:42.545 --> 44:43.378
Get on my knees and grovel?

44:43.379 --> 44:44.751
I'm here for your help Meredith.

44:44.752 --> 44:46.097
Are you gonna help me or not?

44:47.950 --> 44:50.450
You have a demonic entity
embedded into your soul.

44:51.580 --> 44:52.413
Meaning?

44:52.414 --> 44:53.749
Slowly over the next few days,

44:53.750 --> 44:56.049
it's going to start
spreading like an infection.

44:56.050 --> 44:58.573
It's going to poison your spirit body.

45:00.870 --> 45:03.120
Let's say I believe
you, just for a second.

45:04.010 --> 45:07.913
How would I get rid of
this, demonic entity?

45:08.961 --> 45:11.733
You can't, eventually
there'll be no return.

45:16.110 --> 45:18.230
All right, what's the good news then?

45:19.659 --> 45:22.149
Well, as long as you're in
my presence, you're protected.

45:22.150 --> 45:24.139
I hope you're joking.

45:24.140 --> 45:25.789
24/7.

45:25.790 --> 45:26.790
Come on.

45:28.099 --> 45:29.090
Where you going?

45:29.091 --> 45:30.990
Come on I wanna see what you can do.

45:32.410 --> 45:33.243
Where?

45:33.244 --> 45:35.013
Come on, we don't have much time.

45:44.240 --> 45:46.079
What are we doing here?

45:46.080 --> 45:47.203
You'll see.

45:48.386 --> 45:50.857
I don't think we're allowed to be here.

45:59.740 --> 46:01.240
What are we doing?

46:04.177 --> 46:05.177
Pam.

46:07.581 --> 46:09.446
Who are you?

46:09.447 --> 46:11.367
I'm Meredith, this is Frank.

46:11.368 --> 46:13.035
We are here to help.

46:20.878 --> 46:23.193
Frank, come on.

46:39.288 --> 46:43.205
You have the power to heal.

47:01.092 --> 47:02.092
Pam.

47:02.801 --> 47:04.968
I thought you were gone.

47:07.910 --> 47:09.736
What are you doing here?

47:09.737 --> 47:11.119
I'm sorry, wrong room.

47:11.120 --> 47:11.953
Frank, come on.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.769
What the hell just happened here?

47:13.770 --> 47:15.489
They helped him.

47:15.490 --> 47:17.113
Thank you, thank you.

47:19.492 --> 47:22.461
Hey, hey you
guys, come back here.

47:22.462 --> 47:23.660
I'm calling the police.

47:29.339 --> 47:30.339
See, I told you.

47:32.420 --> 47:33.469
That felt really good.

47:33.470 --> 47:35.279
You did a good thing today.

47:35.280 --> 47:36.299
Thanks Meredith.

47:36.300 --> 47:37.350
You're all right too.

47:38.550 --> 47:41.353
Frank Benetti, did you just
say something nice about me?

47:42.200 --> 47:43.200
Come on.

47:45.490 --> 47:48.823
Starting to get through to you, Frank.

47:53.870 --> 47:55.516
So this is what a
witch's house look like.

47:55.517 --> 47:57.153
I never said I was a witch.

47:58.152 --> 48:00.701
Well, it's kinda obvious.

48:00.702 --> 48:03.360
Well, then you'll be
in for a real treat.

48:06.069 --> 48:07.169
Wipe your feet please.

48:19.127 --> 48:20.127
Sit.

48:35.970 --> 48:37.419
Bottoms up.

48:37.420 --> 48:38.719
What vintage is this?

48:38.720 --> 48:40.379
I hear 2013 is a pretty good year.

48:40.380 --> 48:41.883
Just drink it.

48:50.740 --> 48:54.381
Just relax, go with the flow.

48:54.382 --> 48:56.116
It's kinda weird.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.433
Frank, do you hear me.

49:02.428 --> 49:03.261
Yes.

49:03.262 --> 49:04.391
When we're in astral plane,

49:04.392 --> 49:07.617
you cannot see me, only him.

49:22.142 --> 49:25.142
You are now, at the highest plane.

49:28.516 --> 49:31.849
You have opened up a portal to the earth

49:33.170 --> 49:34.837
and let darkness in.

49:36.536 --> 49:38.119
I hope you succeed.

49:43.498 --> 49:46.532
They found a way to break
through the astral plane.

49:46.533 --> 49:47.883
Who is?

49:47.884 --> 49:48.967
The demons.

49:53.750 --> 49:54.750
I need some air.

50:09.408 --> 50:10.883
Please don't do that again.

50:12.970 --> 50:14.349
You have been chosen.

50:14.350 --> 50:15.190
Chosen?

50:15.191 --> 50:16.779
By the Lightbeing.

50:16.780 --> 50:19.449
Meredith, can we just deal
with facts here, please?

50:19.450 --> 50:21.419
You met a Lightbeing, fact.

50:21.420 --> 50:22.956
Yeah, and a couple
of really scary demons

50:22.957 --> 50:25.199
that is scaring the hell out of me.

50:25.200 --> 50:27.629
We need to transform you into a avatar.

50:27.630 --> 50:30.003
Okay, it's time for me to go.

50:31.100 --> 50:33.336
Only then will you be clean.

50:33.337 --> 50:35.839
Meredith, you're a
little too crazy for me

50:35.840 --> 50:38.749
and honestly I think you
need help more than I do.

50:38.750 --> 50:42.159
But, you have zero chance without me.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.259
Save it for the cooks Meredith.

50:44.260 --> 50:48.094
Frank, when you leave my
protection, they will attack you.

50:48.095 --> 50:50.123
I'll tell them you said, hi.

50:51.310 --> 50:52.700
Don't give into them.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.361
Had a hard day?

51:14.494 --> 51:16.244
You could say that.

53:00.646 --> 53:01.646
No, no!

54:07.466 --> 54:09.549
What do you want from me?

55:30.275 --> 55:31.740
You survived.

55:31.741 --> 55:33.689
What a surprise.

55:33.690 --> 55:34.523
You were right.

55:34.524 --> 55:36.549
These demons or what ever they are,

55:36.550 --> 55:37.759
they mean serious business

55:37.760 --> 55:40.089
and I can't fight them alone.

55:40.090 --> 55:42.090
Sorry, what was that first part again?

55:43.670 --> 55:45.339
I need your help.

55:45.340 --> 55:47.673
Splendid, first day
of school starts now.

55:56.000 --> 55:58.459
When you died, you accessed
a power of healing.

55:58.460 --> 56:00.399
Today we're gonna learn mind reading,

56:00.400 --> 56:02.463
psychokinesis and protection.

56:04.690 --> 56:06.763
Frank Benetti, what did I just say?

56:08.090 --> 56:10.339
Oh, healing?

56:10.340 --> 56:12.409
If you don't learn
these, you're a dead man.

56:12.410 --> 56:13.499
Okay, all right, you're right.

56:13.500 --> 56:14.949
Do you understand?

56:14.950 --> 56:16.013
Yes, miss Palin.

56:17.400 --> 56:18.750
Let's get some fresh air.

56:20.450 --> 56:22.199
Relax and hear their voices.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.363
Like you do with me.

56:33.757 --> 56:35.223
You'll get the hang of it.

56:38.870 --> 56:39.953
You have to let go.

56:44.180 --> 56:45.263
Feel their minds.

56:53.550 --> 56:55.203
Let their thoughts reach you.

57:03.670 --> 57:06.599
Frank, here's someone here suffering.

57:06.600 --> 57:07.683
They need your help.

57:08.520 --> 57:10.057
I want you to find him.

57:13.677 --> 57:15.559
This can't be true.

57:18.940 --> 57:20.532
Why me?

57:20.533 --> 57:23.656
It's working, I can hear her.

57:23.657 --> 57:25.733
Please God, help me.

57:26.970 --> 57:27.970
Michelle,

57:31.060 --> 57:34.809
there's no easy way to tell you this.

57:34.810 --> 57:39.393
You have advanced ovarian
cancer, it's terminal.

57:42.540 --> 57:44.133
I know what she's going through.

57:47.602 --> 57:51.019
Advanced ovarian cancer.

57:51.020 --> 57:52.187
It's all over.

58:05.700 --> 58:07.253
My mom had ovarian cancer.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.649
There was nothing they could do for her

58:12.650 --> 58:15.863
and she didn't make it.

58:19.160 --> 58:21.250
I'd like to help you, Michelle.

58:23.070 --> 58:25.446
Who told you?

58:25.447 --> 58:27.257
You don't need to be afraid.

58:30.496 --> 58:33.296
It's
okay Michelle, let him help.

59:05.220 --> 59:07.887
It's God, check with your doctor.

59:31.121 --> 59:33.038
Okay, here we go spoon.

59:41.207 --> 59:43.927
See it clearly moving
in your minds eye.

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:08.993
Ah, I had enough!

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.479
There's only 10 of those
books left in the whole world.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.580
I want you to read it.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:27.743
Ha, I did it!

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:39.912
I want that book in one
piece or you're toast.

01:02:09.837 --> 01:02:14.837
You have the power of
light, it destroys demons.

01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:16.633
Use it.

01:02:19.734 --> 01:02:20.984
Fight darkness.

01:02:22.628 --> 01:02:24.878
You have avatar power, now.

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:55.919
Good morning, Meredith.

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.470
Good morning, how was the book?

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.139
So mister Benneti, do you
know this book backwards,

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.423
sideways and can you
recite it in your sleep?

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.671
All ready here.

01:03:15.505 --> 01:03:17.705
Now you're just showing off.

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.740
Good read.

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:31.387
Okay, point it at me and record.

01:03:31.388 --> 01:03:33.349
A please would be nice.

01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:35.533
Pretty please with sugar on top.

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:37.899
All right.

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.547
Zoch one tabernacle101.com.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:42.029
This is Frank Benneti.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:43.809
Last week I died for one hour

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:46.519
and I can tell you
categorically that there is life

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.669
after death or more specifically
a spiritual consciousness

01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:52.539
that lives on after death.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.229
Now, if it took a fundamentalist
atheist like myself

01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:56.070
to tell you the truth,

01:03:56.071 --> 01:03:59.309
well dying for one hour was well worth it.

01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:01.519
Tune in tonight and tell your friends

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:04.019
because I'm gonna show
you something spectacular

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:05.020
in vlog two.

01:04:09.476 --> 01:04:13.393
Well, from our persecuted
to one of our best.

01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:19.363
Frank Benneti, I am so proud.

01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:22.589
Wow.

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:24.029
It's a graduation present.

01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:26.804
Ha-ha, no way.

01:04:26.805 --> 01:04:27.805
I love it.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.600
Watch.

01:04:43.508 --> 01:04:44.508
Hey!

01:04:45.369 --> 01:04:46.503
Oh my God!

01:04:46.504 --> 01:04:47.346
Wow!

01:04:47.347 --> 01:04:48.391
Fat out!

01:04:48.392 --> 01:04:49.330
How did he do that?

01:04:49.331 --> 01:04:51.019
That's amazing.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:53.819
Okay ladies and gentlemen,
get your phones out.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:54.929
Now on the count of three,

01:04:54.930 --> 01:04:57.419
I want you to answer them on speaker.

01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:00.650
Okay, one, two, three.

01:05:02.997 --> 01:05:03.830
Hey, hey folks.

01:05:03.831 --> 01:05:05.163
This is Frank Benneti.

01:05:05.164 --> 01:05:06.497
Have a nice day.

01:05:08.964 --> 01:05:09.797
What?

01:05:11.655 --> 01:05:12.655
No way,

01:05:14.065 --> 01:05:15.148
that's weird.

01:05:17.989 --> 01:05:19.471
I don't believe it.

01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:36.169
Vlog two is going out
to my old subscriber list.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:38.589
Clint and Sarah can't
stop me accessing it.

01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:39.809
How many?

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:40.969
Millions.

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:42.089
Impressive.

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:44.309
Yeah, this is going global.

01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:47.059
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.189
Ask me no secrets and
I'll tell you no lies.

01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:52.690
How did you go out with
her for so long, I mean?

01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:56.623
Ooh, I think you're
a little bit jealous.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:01.193
No, it's just what was the upside?

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:11.623
You're defense shields are exceptional.

01:06:11.624 --> 01:06:14.659
Well, I learned from the best.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.417
Well, she's about to
call you, right now.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:20.810
Yeah, right.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:27.399
To what do I owe the intense
pleasure of this call?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:28.729
How could you, Frank?

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:31.283
Evidence, any good scientist knows that.

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:40.009
Thanks dude, Sarah and I
are the fuck of the century.

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.970
Mate, you're welcome.

01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:43.969
Glad to see you're recycling my old trash.

01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:45.999
Oh please, please.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.753
I can not handle bad porn.

01:06:49.054 --> 01:06:49.887
You know what Frank,

01:06:49.888 --> 01:06:51.806
I liked you better when you were dead.

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.889
Well I'd love to sit here
trading insults to you guys

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:57.519
but I got more important work to do.

01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:59.929
So why did you call?

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:04.409
Well Frank, I think we
wanna have you on the show.

01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:06.089
Give you a guest spot.

01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:08.759
Well, what an offer?

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.979
Think of the audience numbers, Frank.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.609
Well, I'm honored that you
guys wanna do a hatchet job

01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:17.563
on me but I'm gonna have
to respectfully decline.

01:07:31.042 --> 01:07:33.459
They will attack this time.

01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:37.799
As long as you willingly
don't give them your soul,

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.550
they cannot keep you.

01:07:42.277 --> 01:07:43.893
But no matter what pain,

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:51.735
no matter what they do
to you, never surrender.

01:07:51.736 --> 01:07:53.749
Remember that, Frank.

01:07:55.845 --> 01:07:57.012
Let's do it.

01:08:02.594 --> 01:08:04.511
This time we'll know.

01:08:17.743 --> 01:08:18.932
It was honestly a mistake.

01:08:37.795 --> 01:08:42.462
Ignore
him, hence the ones to come.

01:08:52.585 --> 01:08:53.585
Let's go.

01:08:54.777 --> 01:08:57.529
Follow him.

01:08:57.531 --> 01:08:58.678
Daniel.

01:09:08.153 --> 01:09:10.509
I gotta say, I'm not a
fan of astral travel.

01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:14.439
Two days, we've got two days
until all hell breaks loose.

01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:16.269
What about that computer code,

01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:17.103
all over the screen, what did that mean?

01:09:17.104 --> 01:09:18.133
I'm not sure.

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:20.988
I think it's being
controlled by the demons.

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.189
That street that Daniel
was on, I know that street.

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:24.639
It's just around the corner
from Kathryn's house.

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:25.550
We can go there.

01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:27.412
We need to go meet your nephew.

01:09:28.321 --> 01:09:29.788
It's impossible, I've been blacklisted,

01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:30.622
I can't see him.

01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:32.473
Frank, he is in serious trouble.

01:09:37.154 --> 01:09:37.987
What?

01:09:37.987 --> 01:09:38.987
It's my sister.

01:09:41.884 --> 01:09:42.716
Yeah.

01:09:42.716 --> 01:09:43.550
I need you to come

01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:45.238
to Daniel's birthday tomorrow.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.219
He's acting very strange.

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:48.259
Strange?

01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.629
Yeah, he made a doll called Frank

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:52.693
and started placing pins in it.

01:09:53.528 --> 01:09:54.659
Very strange.

01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:55.500
Then out of the blue,

01:09:55.501 --> 01:09:57.633
he demands to see you at his birthday.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.309
Hey listen, can I bring a friend along.

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:03.819
Yes, of course.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:04.653
Okay, what time.

01:10:04.654 --> 01:10:06.169
Three tomorrow afternoon.

01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:07.003
We'll be there.

01:10:07.003 --> 01:10:08.003
Okay, bye.

01:10:11.298 --> 01:10:13.668
That wasn't an coincidence.

01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:15.632
Tomorrow's gonna be very interesting.

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:33.699
Hey little buddy, happy birthday.

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.700
How are you?

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.530
So you believe in
ghosts now, uncle Frank?

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.159
This is my new friend, Meredith.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.160
Hello.

01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:54.869
Tell me what you've
noticed about Daniel.

01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:56.919
Have you spoken to him?

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.383
No, he's been avoiding me.

01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:01.480
Exactly, he would
never do that normally.

01:11:02.581 --> 01:11:03.919
Kathryn, what's going on?

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.129
You said something about dolls
and pins, I don't understand.

01:11:06.130 --> 01:11:07.777
I told you all ready, I'm...

01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:12.259
I don't wanna say it again,
I feel like I'm going crazy.

01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.399
You're not going crazy Kathryn.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.079
Based on the things I've
seen the last few days,

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:18.159
you wouldn't believe me if I told you.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.949
Can uncle Frank take me camping again?

01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:21.179
I think that's a great idea.

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.279
Ah, no.

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.780
Charles takes you from now on.

01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:26.879
Wait a minute, who's Charles?

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.969
He's my new boyfriend.

01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:29.729
Complete douchebag.

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:30.969
New boyfriend.

01:11:30.970 --> 01:11:32.759
Kathryn, do you really
think that's a good idea?

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:33.690
How long is this been going on for?

01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:35.509
With all this stuff going on.
What do you care?

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:37.759
I care, I care about
my nephew's wellbeing,

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:38.843
that's what I care.

01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:41.089
Where is he anyway?

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:42.599
He's in Melbourne on business.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.433
Oh, that's convenient,

01:11:43.434 --> 01:11:45.129
on the day of your son's birthday.

01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:46.909
Anyway, look who's talking.

01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:47.820
Where's Sarah?

01:11:47.821 --> 01:11:49.539
Sarah and I are
no longer together, okay.

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:52.259
Ah, I really liked her.

01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:57.329
She seems nice.

01:11:57.330 --> 01:11:58.699
Meredith is just a friend, okay.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.669
She's helping me with
extra curricular project.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:04.569
What?

01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.519
Extra curricular
project, sounds like fun.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.169
Don't start, Kathryn.

01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:12.563
I want uncle Frank to
take me camping, bitch.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.309
Right, this is what I've been dealing

01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:18.599
with since your death stunt.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:19.929
Thanks a lot.

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:20.930
Kathryn.

01:14:05.677 --> 01:14:08.094
Daniel, what are you doing?

01:14:09.697 --> 01:14:11.732
She was in my room, snooping Mom.

01:14:11.733 --> 01:14:14.469
I was looking for the bathroom.

01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:15.970
Let me show you where it is.

01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:42.780
He's just a kid.

01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:49.356
I should have been there for him.

01:14:49.357 --> 01:14:51.093
I'm so sorry Frank.

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.823
Have you heard of the dark web?

01:14:58.733 --> 01:14:59.610
No.

01:14:59.611 --> 01:15:02.449
It's off limits, no
search engine can index it,

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:03.649
no law can shut it down.

01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:07.509
It's where they sell drugs,
illegal pornography even slaves.

01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:08.709
Why are you telling me this?

01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:11.029
The demons have created a computer virus

01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:13.129
and planted it on the dark web.

01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:15.963
It's designed to shut down
all online systems on earth.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:22.479
When this hits zero, the virus
will spread exponentially

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:24.030
and it will leave the dark web.

01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:39.649
Vlog three, tabernacle 101.

01:15:39.650 --> 01:15:41.669
This is going out to everybody.

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:42.909
We don't have a lot of time.

01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:45.659
15 hours and 15 minutes to be precise.

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.729
Dark forces have breached the astral plane

01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:49.136
and are now physically on our world.

01:15:49.137 --> 01:15:51.219
They've find a portal.

01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:53.539
This occurred when I died
and came back to life.

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.189
They plan to take control of the internet

01:15:55.190 --> 01:15:57.629
at 12 noon tomorrow.

01:15:57.630 --> 01:16:00.259
Please, get rid of your
mobile phones, laptops,

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:02.749
computers, everything that
is connected to the internet.

01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:04.409
We don't know exactly what will happen

01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:07.112
but we do know that they will
take control of everything

01:16:07.113 --> 01:16:08.809
and I mean everything

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:11.389
including all the world's nuclear arsenal.

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:12.779
This is real.

01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:16.419
This is not fake, get ready for a fight

01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:17.720
and may light be with you.

01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:21.530
I'll post it now.

01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:28.910
Where you going?

01:16:29.816 --> 01:16:30.956
To the liquor store,

01:16:30.957 --> 01:16:33.307
I want their best red while I still can.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:35.820
Hold on, I'll come with you.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.019
No offense Meredith

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:42.329
but I can take care of myself
in case you haven't noticed.

01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:43.968
Frank, if you leave this tabernacle...

01:16:44.803 --> 01:16:47.094
Frank!

01:16:49.868 --> 01:16:50.868
Frank!

01:17:05.309 --> 01:17:06.309
Frank!

01:19:02.457 --> 01:19:04.705
You'll never possess my soul.

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:09.319
The power of Satan now possesses you.

01:19:16.307 --> 01:19:18.143
Repeat after me Frank.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:40.173
You must do
the death experiment again.

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.603
Crossover, deceased.

01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:47.889
You must

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:49.743
destroy the demons.

01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:58.416
You know, I could really miss you.

01:19:58.417 --> 01:19:59.823
How long was I gone?

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:02.963
Way too long.

01:20:05.070 --> 01:20:06.449
Come on, I need your help.

01:20:06.450 --> 01:20:08.309
Frank, do you have any idea

01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:10.729
how hard I worked to rescue you?

01:20:10.730 --> 01:20:11.730
Trust me.

01:20:18.051 --> 01:20:19.412
Hey, what's up?

01:20:19.413 --> 01:20:23.209
Hey Clint, get your camera
ready, we're on our way.

01:20:23.210 --> 01:20:26.813
It's about time, 22
Garden Boulevard, five doc.

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:29.939
Do you mind telling me why we need

01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.299
to meet Sarah and Clint?

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:32.300
Read me.

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:35.563
Need to die again.

01:20:48.737 --> 01:20:49.570
Where's Sarah?

01:20:49.571 --> 01:20:51.119
She's on her way.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:51.953
Is she crazy?

01:20:51.954 --> 01:20:53.373
Chill man, she'll be here.

01:21:02.315 --> 01:21:04.090
Never thought you'd
have the guts, Frank.

01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:06.949
Sarah, do you see this?

01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:08.629
Ah yes, that's a phone.

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:10.719
This is how long we have, Sarah.

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:13.052
Tell me that one about Goldilocks again.

01:21:13.053 --> 01:21:16.129
I'm gonna love watching your
terrified face in a minute.

01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:18.279
Okay, this freak doesn't
stay for the interview.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:21.109
We're gonna ask you
nicely to retract that.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:22.110
Or what?

01:21:24.261 --> 01:21:25.983
Hey, stop please.

01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:30.369
This is how long we have, okay.

01:21:30.370 --> 01:21:31.203
When this hits zero,

01:21:31.204 --> 01:21:34.289
you're gonna see why we need
your help so bad right now.

01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:36.049
I'm so gonna enjoy this.
I need that phone back.

01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:37.699
Sarah, really please, listen.

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:40.179
Clint, you need to turn
that phone off now.

01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:41.429
Clint, are you getting this?

01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:42.689
Yep.
Priceless.

01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:45.973
Five, four three, two.

01:21:57.170 --> 01:21:58.187
Do you see now?

01:22:07.685 --> 01:22:08.685
Clint.

01:22:09.454 --> 01:22:11.537
Better go check on her.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.739
Their controlling every hoax
coming to bust in the city,

01:22:20.740 --> 01:22:22.869
soon the virus is gonna
spread beyond Sydney

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:24.143
to the rest of the world.

01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:27.280
Sarah, we need your help.

01:22:33.137 --> 01:22:34.998
Who are they?

01:22:34.999 --> 01:22:35.999
Darkness.

01:22:38.110 --> 01:22:39.610
Come on, we gotta keep moving.

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.381
Careful, watch your step.

01:22:53.249 --> 01:22:54.082
What do I have to do?

01:22:54.083 --> 01:22:56.199
We need to get back to your lab.

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.009
I need to decease again.

01:22:58.010 --> 01:23:00.872
We started this, you have to finish it.

01:23:00.873 --> 01:23:02.505
How?

01:23:02.506 --> 01:23:05.809
The death experiment
had open up a portal.

01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:08.543
Frank needs to close
it from the other side.

01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.630
We've gotta
go, it's not save here.

01:23:24.144 --> 01:23:26.029
Jesus Christ.

01:23:29.447 --> 01:23:30.447
Come on.

01:23:57.531 --> 01:23:58.531
Hurry!

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:22.029
Frank, if ever I can get you back.

01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:23.853
If I succeed, you will.

01:24:29.649 --> 01:24:32.449
On the other side, your
powers will be magnified.

01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:34.964
You'll be able to fight them.

01:24:34.965 --> 01:24:36.798
Thank you, Meredith.

01:24:38.123 --> 01:24:40.453
It's really touching, are you ready?

01:24:46.233 --> 01:24:48.918
Death will occur in 10 seconds.

01:24:48.919 --> 01:24:51.252
10, nine, eight, seven, six,

01:24:55.477 --> 01:24:58.309
five, four, three, two, one, zero.

01:25:04.353 --> 01:25:07.439
Subject is deceased, decease complete.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.327
Subject is deceased, decease complete.

01:25:58.252 --> 01:26:00.175
What took you so long?

01:26:00.176 --> 01:26:02.176
You proud of yourself?

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.670
Clint, Clint, get out of there.

01:26:16.945 --> 01:26:18.538
What?

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:22.903
Clint, please!

01:27:32.676 --> 01:27:33.676
Shut up!

01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:49.863
Ah, thank you
Sarah for everything you did.

01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:55.903
Don't you dare.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.319
Meredith!

01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.670
Oh, I have a more
fitting end for you, witch.

01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:03.393
Walk witch,

01:28:04.797 --> 01:28:05.797
I said walk.

01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:42.140
What do you think Frank?

01:28:53.284 --> 01:28:54.284
You!

01:29:11.993 --> 01:29:14.841
No Frank, don't listen to...

01:29:14.842 --> 01:29:18.206
Frank,
listen to me, concentrate.

01:29:18.207 --> 01:29:20.272
Use your strength.

01:29:20.273 --> 01:29:21.983
You can do it Frank.

01:29:21.984 --> 01:29:23.484
Come to the light.

01:29:24.735 --> 01:29:25.985
Just reach out.

01:29:26.853 --> 01:29:29.686
Take my hand, you're almost there.

01:29:30.626 --> 01:29:31.626
Keep going.

01:29:50.022 --> 01:29:53.439
Meredith, I hear you,

01:29:56.029 --> 01:29:57.446
I feel the light.

01:29:58.311 --> 01:29:59.644
I feel serenity.

01:30:02.755 --> 01:30:03.755
I see.

01:30:13.632 --> 01:30:15.890
How did you find me?

01:30:15.891 --> 01:30:17.905
The medallion I gave you,

01:30:17.906 --> 01:30:18.993
it traced your soul.

01:30:20.150 --> 01:30:21.800
When you died I could follow you.

01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:25.441
We need your help.

01:30:25.442 --> 01:30:26.783
She knows.

01:30:30.438 --> 01:30:32.540
Wait, be in me.

01:30:41.592 --> 01:30:45.175
You have work to do.

01:31:59.186 --> 01:32:01.103
Uncle Frank?

01:32:10.612 --> 01:32:12.791
Stay here.

01:33:52.354 --> 01:33:53.411
The world is recovering

01:33:53.412 --> 01:33:55.669
from the worst ever cult virus.

01:33:55.670 --> 01:33:58.749
The virus originated in Sydney
and spread around the globe.

01:33:58.750 --> 01:34:02.539
It placed millions of people
into a coma for two hours.

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:04.209
Prime minister Dawkins has said

01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:05.989
that there will be full
investigations into

01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:08.289
what happened and that
the people who perpetrated

01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:12.023
this crime will be arrested
and dealt with in due process.

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:38.809
Sir, would you like to pick any sentence

01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:40.599
from your guidebook, on any page

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.079
but read it out loud.

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:43.080
Okay.

01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:45.250
Have you got one?

01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:46.083
Yeah.

01:34:46.083 --> 01:34:47.083
Great.

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:54.250
Okay, it's one page 266

01:34:55.290 --> 01:34:56.829
and it reads like this,

01:34:56.830 --> 01:35:00.629
for Aboriginals, the concept
of landownership is tied

01:35:00.630 --> 01:35:04.009
to a belief system that
instructs them to care

01:35:04.010 --> 01:35:07.039
for their ancestral land, am I correct?

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:08.393
No way!

01:35:10.142 --> 01:35:11.649
Thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen.

01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:13.740
My name is Frank Benetti.

01:36:05.730 --> 01:36:07.399
Just what I need,

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.803
another stalking spirit
following me around.

01:36:14.319 --> 01:36:15.999
I liked your show.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.850
Man's got to earn a living somehow.

01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:21.029
I don't know if I ever told you this

01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:25.203
but thank you for believing in me.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:31.359
Well, mister Benetti.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.558
I hate to burst the bubble,

01:36:33.559 --> 01:36:35.318
you got work to do.

01:36:35.319 --> 01:36:36.319
Work?

01:36:38.735 --> 01:36:40.479
We got a huge problem this time.

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.299
Wait, what are you talking about?

01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:43.913
It's causing havoc everywhere.

01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:46.551
Who?

01:36:46.552 --> 01:36:47.552
Clint.
