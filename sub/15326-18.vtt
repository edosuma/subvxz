09:15.763 --> 09:16.806
I SMELL A GROUP HUG.

09:16.889 --> 09:20.101
- DIBS ON KYLE.

09:20.184 --> 09:23.312
- HI, HI, HI!

09:23.396 --> 09:27.149
LOOK WHAT I SNATCHED FROM THOSE

09:27.233 --> 09:30.736
LOUSY EBNUTTER'S FRONT YARD.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.407
SOMEBODY TAKE A PICTURE, PLEASE.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.951
- ALLOW ME.
- YES.

09:37.034 --> 09:37.618
- ALL RIGHT.

09:37.702 --> 09:42.665
EVERYONE SAY, "LAWSUIT."

09:42.748 --> 09:45.668
- MOM, MEET THE EBNETTERS.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.338
- MAGGIE TURNER.

09:49.422 --> 09:54.093
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A NEW MAILBOX.

09:54.176 --> 09:57.513
- WE'RE LEAVING.
KYLE, GET THE GNOME.

09:57.596 --> 10:00.349
- SO STEPHANIE, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR EVERYTHING.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.101
AND I REALLY NEED TO GET
YOUR RECIPE FOR THOSE PASTRIES.

10:02.184 --> 10:05.938
- JUST GO TO THE STORE, BUY
SOME, AND HAVE AARON LICK 'EM.

10:07.523 --> 10:10.443
- OKAY.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.527
- BYE, KYLE.

10:11.610 --> 10:15.698
PARTING IS SUCH A BUMMER.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.743
- RIGHT.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.536
- THIS IS JUST LIKE
<i>ROMEO AND JULIET.</i>

10:20.620 --> 10:23.539
I FINALLY FOUND MY SOUL MATE,

10:23.622 --> 10:27.710
AND NOW OUR FAMILIES ARE AT WAR.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.045
- DID YOU LICK THIS ONE?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.547
- YOU KNOW I LICKED ALL OF THEM.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.217
[funky music]

10:35.301 --> 10:37.470
- IT'S TIME TO MAKE PEACE.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.056
ON A COUNT OF THREE,
WE YELL,

10:40.139 --> 10:41.390
"WE'RE SORRY, EBNETTERS."

10:41.474 --> 10:44.602
- THEY DON'T HAVE EMAIL?

10:44.685 --> 10:47.480
- OKAY, ONE, TWO THREE.

10:47.563 --> 10:50.691
all: WE'RE SORRY, EBNETTERS!

10:52.068 --> 10:53.069
- [gasps]

10:53.152 --> 10:54.070
WHAT WAS THAT?

10:54.153 --> 10:56.405
- A TOMATO.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.408
HOW IRONIC.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.576
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME,
EBNETTER?

11:00.659 --> 11:03.079
THAT'S MY WIFE YOU TOMATO-ED!

11:03.162 --> 11:05.414
AND THIS IS WAR!

11:07.500 --> 11:10.461
DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW WAR WORKS?

11:10.544 --> 11:11.712
GET BACK IN THERE!

11:11.796 --> 11:12.797
GET IN THERE!
MOVE IT, MOVE IT, MOVE IT!

11:16.050 --> 11:17.468
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

11:17.551 --> 11:18.928
THINK BIG.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.597
- WHAT IF WE ATTACH BALLOONS
TO THEIR HOUSE

11:21.680 --> 11:25.059
SO IT GETS LIFTED INTO SPACE?

11:25.142 --> 11:26.852
- THINK LESS BIG.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.522
- YOU HAVE TO STOP FIGHTING
WITH THE EBNETTERS.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.941
YOU'RE TEARING
KYLE AND ME APART.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.986
STEPHANIE, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
YOU'LL END THIS FEUD.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.738
FOR ME.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.532
- ALL RIGHT.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.033
I'LL END IT.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.868
FOR YOU.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.412
- THANK YOU.

11:46.872 --> 11:49.708
- BUT I'LL PICK IT
RIGHT BACK UP FOR ME.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.544
OKAY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

11:51.627 --> 11:55.381
ALL WE'LL NEED IS A FLASHLIGHT
AND SOME PLIERS.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.383
- GOOD, YOU'RE HERE.

11:57.466 --> 12:00.052
SWEETHEART,
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE

12:00.136 --> 12:02.721
ABOUT THE WHOLE GNOME FIASCO.

12:02.805 --> 12:03.973
YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:04.056 --> 12:04.974
IT WASN'T MY FIGHT.
I JUST MADE THINGS--

12:05.057 --> 12:07.017
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
CHANGE OF PLANS:

12:07.101 --> 12:08.602
WE'RE GONNA RE-ADJUST
THE EBNETTER'S SPRINKLER SYSTEM.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.397
- YES!

12:11.480 --> 12:14.692
OOH!
MAYBE THEY'LL GET BLACK MOLD.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.904
- OH, YEAH.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.197
I GOT EBNETTER GOOD.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.491
GET THIS:

12:22.575 --> 12:25.077
HIS NEWSPAPER BILL
WAS OUTSIDE ON THE SIDEWALK.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.745
SO I PAID IT.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.500
IN FULL.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.836
FOR ALL NEXT MONTH.

12:33.919 --> 12:37.548
- BUH-BAM!

12:37.631 --> 12:40.009
- SEE, WHEN THEY TRY TO PAY,

12:40.092 --> 12:43.721
THEY'LL THINK
THEY FORGOT TO RECORD A CHECK.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.055
IT'S AN ACCOUNTING NIGHTMARE,

12:45.139 --> 12:50.436
CONFUSION ALL OVER THE PLACE.

12:50.519 --> 12:54.940
- I'M TRYING TO THINK OF A WORD
BELOW LAME.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.775
- OH, OKAY, OKAY,
MAYBE I DIDN'T SAY IT RIGHT.

12:56.859 --> 12:57.693
NEWSPAPER BILL--

12:57.776 --> 12:59.570
- NO, WE GET IT.
WE GET IT.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.572
IT'S JUST NOT QUITE
THE DEVASTATING PAYBACK

13:01.655 --> 13:03.532
WE WERE GOING FOR.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.912
- CHARLIE, I SURE HOPE
YOU NEVER GET MAD AT ME.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.831
I MIGHT END UP
WITH MY MORTGAGE PAID OFF.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.085
- OH, I SEE.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.545
YOU'RE THE EXPERTS ON PAYBACK.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.130
THAT'S FINE.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.841
BUT YOU JUST WAIT TILL
EBNETTER'S SCRATCHING HIS HEAD,

13:20.925 --> 13:23.719
TRYING TO BALANCE HIS CHECKBOOK.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.179
JUST WAIT!

13:34.104 --> 13:35.147
- KYLE.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.732
KYLE.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.572
[thumping and clanking]

13:46.909 --> 13:48.285
- OW!

13:49.745 --> 13:50.579
WHAT THE HECK?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.873
DID YOU THROW A ROCK AT ME?

13:52.957 --> 13:55.125
- I WAS TRYING
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.920
- THAT'S GONNA LEAVE A MARK,
DEBBIE.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.047
- IT'S GABBY.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.549
AND I WANT TO READ YOU SOMETHING

14:01.632 --> 14:04.051
THAT I'VE RECENTLY DECIDED
WASN'T STUPID.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.344
IT'S POETRY.

14:05.427 --> 14:09.807
- I'M MORE OF A FAN FICTION GUY,
BUT WHATEVER.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.101
- "IT IS NOR HAND, NOR FOOT,

14:12.184 --> 14:13.769
"NOR ARM, NOR FACE,

14:13.852 --> 14:16.230
NOR ANY OTHER PART
BELONGING TO A MAN--"

14:16.313 --> 14:21.277
- SO, OKAY,
THIS IS ABOUT DISMEMBERMENT?

14:21.360 --> 14:23.445
- NO, IT'S ABOUT LOVE.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.949
"OH, BE SOME OTHER NAME.

14:27.032 --> 14:27.992
"WHAT'S IN A NAME?

14:28.075 --> 14:30.077
"THAT WHICH WE CALL A ROSE,

14:30.160 --> 14:33.289
BY ANY OTHER NAME
WOULD SMELL AS SWEET."

14:33.372 --> 14:34.540
- OKAY.

14:34.623 --> 14:38.544
WELL, YOU WROTE
A REAL SOLID POEM THERE.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.546
- I-I DIDN'T--

14:40.629 --> 14:41.797
THANKS.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.090
GOOD NIGHT, KYLE.

14:43.173 --> 14:44.550
- NIGHT, DEBBIE.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.263
- OKAY, WE MOVE FAST.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.514
GET IN,

14:50.598 --> 14:52.349
RE-ADJUST THEIR SPRINKLERS,
AND RUN.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.559
- STEPH, I'M TELLING YOU.

14:53.642 --> 14:54.935
A LITTLE DETERGENT
IN THEIR FOUNTAIN

14:55.019 --> 14:57.313
WOULD MAKE A NICE BUBBLE PARTY.

14:57.396 --> 14:58.147
- I SAID, "NO."

14:58.230 --> 15:00.357
IT WOULD BE TOO BIG OF A MESS.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.984
LISTEN, WITH REVENGE,

15:02.067 --> 15:04.320
THERE'S A CERTAIN LINE
YOU DON'T CROSS.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.571
- ANOTHER REVENGE RULE?

15:05.654 --> 15:08.490
REVENGE IS STARTING
TO SOUND LIKE SCHOOL.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.950
- I'M HERE!

15:10.034 --> 15:12.119
- HONEY,
WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT?

15:12.202 --> 15:13.996
YOU SAID I NEED TO WEAR
BRIGHT CLOTHING AT NIGHT

15:14.079 --> 15:16.123
SO CARS CAN SEE ME.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.542
- YES,
BUT THERE WON'T BE ANY CARS

15:18.626 --> 15:21.462
AND WE DON'T WANT ANYONE
TO SEE US, OKAY?

15:21.545 --> 15:22.504
HERE.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.714
OKAY.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.007
TIME FOR OPERATION
"CHANGE THE EBNETTER'S

15:25.090 --> 15:28.927
SPRINKLER SYSTEM
SO IT SPRAYS THEIR HOUSE."

15:29.011 --> 15:31.513
WE'LL COME UP
WITH A COOL NAME LATER.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.224
- I THOUGHT WE WERE PUTTING SOAP
IN THEIR FOUNTAIN.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.060
- NO, THAT'S CROSSING A LINE.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.856
[sprinkler sputtering]

15:41.857 --> 15:42.691
- UGH.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.361
I THINK THE LINE JUST MOVED.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.488
- GET THE SOAP.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.574
[funky music]

15:50.658 --> 15:51.742
[laughing]

15:51.825 --> 15:53.702
HONEY, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THAT FOUNTAIN.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.288
IT WAS ALL BUBBLY AND FOAMY.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.998
IT LOOKED LIKE THEIR YARD
HAD RABIES.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.583
[both laugh]

15:59.667 --> 16:01.502
OH, IX-NAY ON THE OUNTAIN-FAY.

16:01.585 --> 16:02.503
- YEAH.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.004
- REALLY?

16:04.088 --> 16:06.382
PIG LATIN?
DO YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT-FAY?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.594
I KNOW YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE EBNETTERS.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.846
BUT I'M OVER KYLE.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.056
- WHAT BROUGHT THIS ABOUT?

16:14.139 --> 16:15.724
- I GOT TO THE END
OF <i> ROMEO AND JULIET.</i>

16:15.808 --> 16:18.310
IT'S ONE THING TO BE INTO A GUY,

16:18.394 --> 16:22.064
BUT SERIOUSLY,
MUTUAL SUICIDE?

16:22.147 --> 16:23.649
- SPOILER ALERT.

16:25.943 --> 16:27.903
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
I THINK THE WHOLE STORY

16:27.986 --> 16:30.614
BORDERS ON TRAGEDY.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.911
- SO HOW 'BOUT I MAKE US
SOME BREAKFAST?

16:35.994 --> 16:37.371
- IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR EGGS,
THEY'RE GONE.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.622
THEY'VE BEEN PUT TO GOOD USE.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.749
- WAIT.
WAIT A MINUTE.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.750
WHAT DID YOU TWO DO?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.044
- WE EGGED A BUNCH OF HOUSES.

16:46.004 --> 16:49.174
- HOUSES? PLURAL?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.301
- YEP.
WE SETTLED SCORES.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.010
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.349
- REMEMBER HOW MAD YOU WERE
WHEN THE CAMPBELLS

16:57.433 --> 16:59.435
STARTED THEIR LEAF-BLOWER
AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING?

16:59.518 --> 17:03.313
- AND THE TAYLORS LET THEIR DOG
POOP ON OUR LAWN?

17:03.397 --> 17:05.523
- AND YOU SAID THE KIRKLANDS
WERE JUST WEIRD?

17:05.607 --> 17:08.902
- THEY GOT TWO EGGS.

17:08.986 --> 17:12.656
- BOYS, WHAT YOU DID
WAS NOT RIGHT.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.741
- WHY NOT?

17:13.824 --> 17:15.075
YOU DID.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.579
- WELL, THAT WAS DIFFERENT
BECAUSE...

17:18.662 --> 17:19.496
CHARLIE?

17:19.579 --> 17:21.957
- BECAUSE IT SERVED 'EM RIGHT.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.666
- YOU GUYS ARE PATHETIC.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.294
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE CHILDREN.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.296
- NUH-UH.

17:27.378 --> 17:30.007
- YOU NEED TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY
TO THE NEIGHBORS.

17:30.090 --> 17:30.924
[both scoff]

17:31.008 --> 17:33.844
- YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS OF US.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.138
- WELL, I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO WAS MATURE ENOUGH

17:36.221 --> 17:38.474
TO STAY OUT OF THESE
SHENANIGANS.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.102
NOW, YOU TWO MARCH NEXT DOOR
AND APOLOGIZE.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.063
SHOW THEM THAT YOU'RE
THE BIGGER PEOPLE.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.732
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

17:46.815 --> 17:47.983
I'M NEEDED ON TWITTER.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.738
[knocking]

17:56.700 --> 17:58.494
- OH, EUNICE.
HOYT.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.162
- HI, STEPHANIE.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.371
UM, LISTEN, HOYT AND I--

18:01.455 --> 18:04.416
WE--WE THOUGHT WE'D COME BY
AND APOLOGIZE

18:04.500 --> 18:05.793
FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,

18:05.876 --> 18:08.003
YOU KNOW, BEFORE THINGS
GOT ANY MORE OUT OF HAND.

18:08.086 --> 18:10.005
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, HOYT?

18:10.088 --> 18:11.882
HOYT!

18:11.965 --> 18:15.719
- UH, YEAH, WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.846
- ANYWAY, I MADE A NICE PIE

18:17.930 --> 18:20.224
JUST TO SHOW YOU
HOW SORRY WE ARE.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.475
- A PIE?

18:21.558 --> 18:22.768
- THAT'S NOT ENOUGH?
YOU WANT A LITTLE SONG?

18:22.851 --> 18:26.188
WE'RE NOT THAT SORRY.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.858
- ARE YOU SORRY ENOUGH
TO GIVE US OUR GARDEN BACK?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.568
- FINE, HAVE YOUR GARDEN.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.070
ARE WE DONE?

18:33.153 --> 18:34.696
I HAVE TO GET HOME
AND WORK ON MY CHECKBOOK.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.907
THERE'S SOMETHING
ALL SCREWED UP WITH IT!

18:40.285 --> 18:43.247
- HA!
I KNEW IT WOULD BREAK 'EM!

18:43.330 --> 18:44.373
- HA-HA!

18:44.456 --> 18:47.501
YES, SWEETIE.
YOU ARE AN EVIL GENIUS.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.210
[both laugh]

18:48.293 --> 18:50.170
NOW LET'S HAVE SOME PIE.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.549
- PIE FOR BREAKFAST?
YES!

18:53.632 --> 18:55.509
- AH.

18:55.592 --> 18:56.969
WHAT'S WRONG?

18:57.052 --> 18:58.595
- I GUESS THIS MEANS THE
EBNETTERS ARE THE BIGGER PEOPLE.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.139
- YEAH.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.057
BIGGER.

19:02.140 --> 19:02.641
- YEAH, BIGGER.
PIE TIME!

19:02.724 --> 19:06.520
CUTTY CUT CUT.

19:06.603 --> 19:11.024
- UNLESS THEY DID THIS
JUST TO MAKE US FEEL SMALL.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.694
THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE BIGGER.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.070
THEY'D BE SMALLER.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.321
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.073
THEY'D BE SMALL, SMALL PEOPLE.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.741
- MM-HMM.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.742
ALL RIGHT.

19:20.826 --> 19:25.455
UH, UNLESS...

19:25.539 --> 19:26.915
SOMETHING'S UP WITH THE PIE.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.168
- FOOD FROM OUR SWORN ENEMIES.

19:30.252 --> 19:34.089
COULD BE A TROJAN PIE.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.426
- HI, HI, HI!

19:37.509 --> 19:40.804
OOH, PIE, PIE, PIE!

19:40.888 --> 19:42.931
- MOM, BEFORE YOU EAT THAT--

19:43.015 --> 19:43.974
- OH, OH, OH, OH,
OH, WHOA, WHOA.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.810
CANARY IN A COAL MINE.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.855
LET'S SEE HOW THIS GOES.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.025
- MMM.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.153
- OKAY, YOU GUYS.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.614
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE APOLOGIZED
TO EVERYONE ON THIS LIST

19:58.697 --> 20:00.449
EXCEPT FOR THE HENSELS.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.159
- WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
TO THE HENSELS.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.827
- WELL, SOMEBODY REPAINTED
THEIR HOUSE NUMBER

20:03.911 --> 20:05.829
FROM 1403 TO 1408.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.206
- WE LOVE THE HENSELS.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.334
MRS. HENSEL IS ALWAYS TELLING
THE FUNNIEST JOKES

20:10.417 --> 20:11.585
ABOUT GRANDMA MAGGIE.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.548
- WELL, I GOT A JOKE FOR HER.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.132
KNOCK, KNOCK.

20:17.215 --> 20:17.799
WHO'S THERE?

20:17.883 --> 20:20.302
NOT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,

20:20.385 --> 20:23.931
BECAUSE THEY'RE CIRCLING
THE BLOCK LOOKING FOR 1403.

20:26.683 --> 20:30.187
AND THAT'S HOW WE DO THAT.
