02:12.424 --> 02:14.008
Well?

02:24.520 --> 02:28.773
Zeus, king of the gods
of the Greeks...

02:29.650 --> 02:33.736
...write in the ashes
so that I may read the future.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.115
I see...

02:39.076 --> 02:42.788
...a great tree
at the end of the world.

02:42.956 --> 02:47.417
And in its branches there hang
the skull and the skin of a ram.

02:47.585 --> 02:49.545
They gleam and shine...

02:49.712 --> 02:53.423
...for it is a prize of the gods,
a Golden Fleece.

02:53.591 --> 02:57.719
We've no time for riddles
and mysteries. Tell me of tonight.

03:01.599 --> 03:05.686
Pelias, you will conquer tonight.

03:05.854 --> 03:08.438
You will overthrow
the kingdom of Thessaly.

03:08.606 --> 03:11.900
You will kill the king, Aristo,
and wear his crown.

03:12.068 --> 03:14.903
You will do all these things
without fear or wound...

03:15.071 --> 03:16.738
...because Zeus commands it.

03:16.906 --> 03:21.785
If I'm protected by Zeus,
I will have no need of this.

03:21.953 --> 03:25.247
I will lay it on the fire
as a thank offering to the gods.

03:25.415 --> 03:27.291
Pelias...

03:27.458 --> 03:32.462
...it is also foretold that although
you will win the throne of Aristo...

03:32.630 --> 03:36.633
...you will, when Zeus ordains,
lose it...

03:36.801 --> 03:39.469
...to one of Aristo's children.

03:41.973 --> 03:45.518
- Then Aristo will have no children.
- He has three, Pelias.

03:45.686 --> 03:49.272
Two daughters,
Philomela and Briseis...

03:49.440 --> 03:51.566
...and a son, Jason.

03:52.401 --> 03:55.904
Then two daughters and a son
will die with their father tonight.

05:09.062 --> 05:13.399
Hera, queen of gods, protect
this child, my sister Philomela.

05:13.566 --> 05:16.068
And if I, Briseis, am worthy...

05:16.236 --> 05:18.404
...take me into your protection.

05:44.556 --> 05:46.766
Are you Briseis,
the daughter of Aristo?

05:46.934 --> 05:50.061
Be silent. She is praying.

05:52.231 --> 05:55.859
For her sister
and for her murdered father, Aristo.

05:56.944 --> 05:58.194
Are you a priestess?

05:58.362 --> 05:59.863
I serve the gods.

06:00.031 --> 06:03.825
Then tell me, has Briseis
called upon the goddess Hera?

06:03.993 --> 06:05.035
She has.

06:05.453 --> 06:07.871
And has the goddess
heard her prayer?

06:08.039 --> 06:09.622
Yes.

06:10.624 --> 06:12.959
Then pray for me.

06:17.465 --> 06:19.507
It is the will of Zeus.

06:19.675 --> 06:22.761
It is not the will of Zeus.
It is your will.

06:22.928 --> 06:25.305
Zeus has given you a kingdom.

06:25.473 --> 06:28.475
The rest will be your own doing.

06:33.022 --> 06:35.648
The gods abandon you, Pelias.

06:35.816 --> 06:37.984
A one-sandaled man shall come...

06:38.152 --> 06:41.488
...and no god shall protect you
from him.

06:41.655 --> 06:43.782
A one-sandaled man?

06:44.450 --> 06:47.453
The child who has escaped you:
Jason.

06:52.709 --> 06:55.628
Then why was I not told
the whole prophecy?

06:56.671 --> 06:59.507
Why did Zeus drive me
to kill this girl...

06:59.674 --> 07:02.468
...when the only one I needed to kill
was Jason?

07:02.636 --> 07:05.429
Zeus cannot drive men
to do what you have done.

07:05.597 --> 07:07.848
Men drive themselves
to do such things...

07:08.016 --> 07:09.767
...that the gods may know them...

07:09.935 --> 07:13.145
...and that men
may understand themselves.

07:13.313 --> 07:16.690
The killing of Jason
would do you no good.

07:18.401 --> 07:22.029
Kill Jason and you kill yourself.

07:41.341 --> 07:44.093
Zeus, my godly husband,
did you, for some reason...

07:44.261 --> 07:46.763
...order the profanation
of my temple in Thessaly?

07:46.931 --> 07:49.266
That was entirely
the thought of Pelias.

07:49.433 --> 07:52.394
Not content with winning the throne
of Thessaly, as I wished...

07:52.562 --> 07:56.148
...he tried to avoid losing it
as I have commanded.

08:00.069 --> 08:03.155
I know that you've
been insulted, my dear.

08:03.322 --> 08:06.408
But be content.
The boy, Jason, has escaped.

08:06.576 --> 08:08.910
- He will avenge you.
- How?

08:09.078 --> 08:12.664
You must know by now I never arrange
exact and precise details...

08:12.832 --> 08:16.376
And because you are neither exact
nor precise, a young girl was killed...

08:16.544 --> 08:19.171
...and my temple was profaned.

08:20.923 --> 08:23.675
- I want to help Jason.
- No.

08:23.843 --> 08:26.761
You may help the infant, Philomela,
if you wish. She's a girl.

08:26.929 --> 08:28.471
The rest is man's work.

08:28.639 --> 08:32.308
No. I want to help Jason.

08:32.643 --> 08:34.477
As you wish.

08:35.104 --> 08:38.690
How many times did Aristo's daughter
Briseis call upon you?

08:38.857 --> 08:42.027
- By name?
- Five.

08:42.195 --> 08:45.155
Well, then you can help
her brother five times.

08:45.323 --> 08:49.452
Five times only you can help him
to overthrow Pelias.

08:49.620 --> 08:52.246
And that is my final word.

08:52.873 --> 08:55.708
It will be 20 years
before Jason becomes a man.

08:55.876 --> 08:59.337
Oh, an instant of time
here on Mount Olympus...

08:59.504 --> 09:03.466
...but a long 20 years
for King Pelias.

09:06.386 --> 09:09.305
He cautiously travels
the roads of Thessaly.

09:09.473 --> 09:13.768
Yes, Pelias, you have had years
of watching and waiting...

09:13.936 --> 09:16.145
...for the man
who must come to kill you.

09:17.105 --> 09:19.482
The man with one sandal.

10:33.224 --> 10:34.516
I owe you my life.

10:34.892 --> 10:37.019
That was as good a way
to ford a river as any.

10:37.186 --> 10:39.730
But I seem to have lost a sandal
in doing it.

10:40.606 --> 10:41.732
Where are you traveling?

10:41.899 --> 10:43.317
To the palace of the king.

10:43.985 --> 10:46.361
- Pelias?
- Pelias of Thessaly.

10:47.155 --> 10:49.824
Then I can put you on your way.

10:52.077 --> 10:55.663
But first, you must accept
the hospitality of my camp.

10:55.831 --> 10:57.457
Come.

11:25.778 --> 11:27.612
Be seated.

11:52.639 --> 11:54.431
You have not yet
told me your name.

11:54.599 --> 11:57.726
I am Jason,
the lawful king of Thessaly.

11:58.978 --> 12:02.398
One of my father's soldiers rescued
me and brought me up in exile.

12:02.565 --> 12:04.483
Now I've returned
to claim my kingdom.

12:04.901 --> 12:07.903
I have waited for you for 20 years.

12:08.071 --> 12:10.489
And in that 20 years,
Pelias has turned my kingdom...

12:10.657 --> 12:14.326
...from the pride of Greece
to a savage, evil land.

12:14.494 --> 12:15.828
I shall need your help.

12:15.995 --> 12:20.916
When your father defended his throne,
no man fought harder than I.

12:21.084 --> 12:23.627
This time it will not
be enough to fight.

12:23.795 --> 12:25.129
I could fight.

12:25.296 --> 12:27.756
I could find Pelias and kill him.

12:27.924 --> 12:29.758
But the people need more
than a leader.

12:29.926 --> 12:33.262
They must believe
the gods have not deserted them.

12:33.763 --> 12:36.640
- They need a miracle.
- And where will you find this miracle?

12:36.808 --> 12:39.351
I have heard there is a tree
at the end of the world...

12:39.519 --> 12:42.020
...with a fleece of gold
hanging in its branches.

12:42.188 --> 12:43.689
I have heard this too.

12:44.441 --> 12:45.941
So have many men.

12:46.109 --> 12:48.569
They say it is a gift of the gods.

12:48.736 --> 12:53.199
It has the power to heal, bring peace
and rid the land of plague and famine.

12:53.659 --> 12:56.369
If I could find this prize
and bring it home to Thessaly...

12:56.537 --> 13:00.665
...then it would inspire the people,
wipe out the years of misrule.

13:00.833 --> 13:03.084
They would know the gods
have not abandoned them.

13:03.252 --> 13:05.044
My land would be
rich and strong again...

13:05.504 --> 13:09.090
...as it was before this tyrant, Pelias,
murdered my father.

13:09.258 --> 13:10.383
Jason...

13:11.051 --> 13:13.094
...be advised by me.

13:13.262 --> 13:15.555
First, search for this Golden Fleece.

13:15.723 --> 13:18.892
Do not reveal yourself to Pelias,
but build a ship...

13:19.059 --> 13:21.561
...and find a crew,
and when you have this prize...

13:21.729 --> 13:23.396
...then and only then...

13:24.356 --> 13:26.858
...return and kill Pelias.

13:34.116 --> 13:36.367
And now rest yourself.

13:37.036 --> 13:39.913
My companions are yours
to command.

13:45.586 --> 13:49.047
Father, why do you let him live?

13:49.215 --> 13:54.011
If I destroy him, Acastus,
I destroy myself.

13:54.179 --> 13:56.263
While he is searching
for the Golden Fleece...

13:56.431 --> 14:00.100
...he is at the ends of the earth
and I am safe.

14:00.268 --> 14:02.436
And if he finds it?

14:04.314 --> 14:05.940
You will be there.

14:15.534 --> 14:18.911
Have you come to pray
to the gods, Jason?

14:19.663 --> 14:23.290
If I had, I wouldn't
have chosen a fallen one.

14:24.125 --> 14:26.126
Only a statue.

14:27.295 --> 14:30.256
Sometimes the gods argue
amongst themselves.

14:30.423 --> 14:31.966
Then great winds blow...

14:32.133 --> 14:33.801
...and temples fall.

14:34.469 --> 14:36.637
- Hermes.
- Yes?

14:37.556 --> 14:41.767
No, I said the statue
was the god Hermes.

14:43.103 --> 14:45.688
- Hermes.
- Yes.

14:46.022 --> 14:50.150
A bringer of dreams
and a prowler of the night.

14:51.112 --> 14:52.821
Jason.

14:58.411 --> 15:00.620
No man can tell you
how to find the fleece.

15:02.331 --> 15:05.375
Is it not time you asked the gods?

15:05.960 --> 15:08.670
They will not answer
those who believe in them.

15:08.838 --> 15:10.797
Why should they answer one
who doesn't?

15:13.134 --> 15:15.302
Come with me.

15:16.554 --> 15:18.179
Why?

15:19.348 --> 15:21.850
So that you will believe...

15:22.018 --> 15:24.519
...and be answered.

16:47.229 --> 16:48.979
You win, my lord.

16:49.147 --> 16:53.652
That is, the battle, not the war.

16:56.197 --> 16:59.491
Oh, those waters
are far too shallow for galleys.

16:59.659 --> 17:03.286
Hera, my dear, you really must learn
to win without cheating.

17:03.454 --> 17:06.455
Or at least to lose gracefully.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.636
- Greetings, Hermes.
- Greetings, my lord Zeus.

17:20.972 --> 17:22.723
There seems to be a piece missing.

17:22.890 --> 17:25.058
Perhaps I can help.

17:33.484 --> 17:36.486
Welcome to Olympus, Jason.

17:42.744 --> 17:45.954
Jason come to Mount Olympus
at last.

17:46.122 --> 17:49.833
No man calls upon the gods
unless he wants something.

17:50.001 --> 17:53.337
We arranged for you
to be brought here by Hermes.

17:53.505 --> 17:57.133
I wouldn't have believed a mortal
could ask the help of the gods...

17:58.135 --> 18:00.344
...much less visit them.

18:00.512 --> 18:03.222
Well, at least you're honest.

18:03.390 --> 18:06.517
Which is more than I can say
for most other mortals.

18:07.102 --> 18:09.020
What is it you want?

18:09.188 --> 18:11.564
A ship? A crew?

18:11.732 --> 18:14.776
No. Those I can find myself.

18:16.153 --> 18:18.613
And what are you going to use
in place of gold?

18:18.781 --> 18:20.364
The hearts of men.

18:20.532 --> 18:24.535
I am Hera, queen of the gods
and your protector on this voyage.

18:24.703 --> 18:27.789
But my lord Zeus has decreed a limit
to the number of times...

18:27.956 --> 18:31.209
...I may help you when you call
upon me. Do not speak now.

18:31.376 --> 18:32.877
I know what you must ask of me.

18:33.045 --> 18:36.923
Does the Golden Fleece exist?
And if so, where is it?

18:37.090 --> 18:38.549
That's two questions.

18:38.717 --> 18:41.594
And I shall help him
with only one answer.

18:41.762 --> 18:43.554
Search in the land of Colchis.

18:44.848 --> 18:46.891
Then it does exist.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.602
But Colchis...

18:49.770 --> 18:52.980
That's the end of the world.
No Greek has ever sailed there.

18:53.148 --> 18:54.691
Now that you've heard that...

18:54.859 --> 18:58.237
...are you so sure
that you will not need my help?

18:58.988 --> 19:00.906
Think carefully.

19:01.950 --> 19:04.201
I offered him a ship.

19:04.369 --> 19:07.120
A ship and a crew.

19:07.455 --> 19:10.082
And he refused me.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.417
Refused the help of the gods?

19:17.090 --> 19:21.343
What ship is strong enough
to reach to the edge of the world?

19:21.511 --> 19:24.263
What crew brave enough
to sail in her?

19:24.889 --> 19:26.765
I shall tell
the shipbuilders of Greece...

19:26.933 --> 19:29.726
...that the richest cargo in the world
waits in Colchis.

19:29.894 --> 19:31.645
The Golden Fleece
is worth a kingdom.

19:31.813 --> 19:35.941
I shall say that only the strongest ship
ever built will survive the voyage.

19:36.109 --> 19:38.527
The athletes of Greece are proud.

19:38.695 --> 19:40.946
I'll tell them only the best
can expect a place...

19:41.114 --> 19:43.490
...in the most perilous voyage
in history.

19:43.658 --> 19:44.950
I shall announce a games...

19:45.118 --> 19:47.786
...invite the strongest
and bravest of the Greeks.

19:48.705 --> 19:50.956
No greater games
shall ever be held...

19:51.124 --> 19:53.458
...unless the gods decree otherwise.

19:57.298 --> 20:00.174
I did well to choose you, Jason.

20:00.342 --> 20:05.138
The gods are best served
by those who want their help least.

20:09.518 --> 20:11.978
Welcome, Polydeuces.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.523
Castor of Sparta.

20:19.653 --> 20:23.031
Acastus of Thessaly.

20:30.122 --> 20:31.915
Well done, Acastus.

20:32.082 --> 20:36.461
Phalerus of Athens,
champion archer of Greece.

20:36.629 --> 20:39.130
Euphemus of Taenarum.

20:39.298 --> 20:41.716
Spyros of Syracuse.

20:41.884 --> 20:43.509
Hercules!

20:43.677 --> 20:45.428
He's here!

20:57.859 --> 21:01.528
I mean to sail with you, Jason. Tell me
which champion you want me to beat.

21:02.530 --> 21:06.283
No one. I know you can beat us all.
Your place is reserved.

21:06.785 --> 21:09.870
Hercules. Yes.

21:12.374 --> 21:14.917
- Hercules?
- Yes.

21:15.085 --> 21:16.710
My name is Hylas.

21:16.878 --> 21:20.089
Like you, I came too late
to compete in the games.

21:20.256 --> 21:23.050
But it occurs to me that
if I can beat you at something...

21:23.218 --> 21:25.803
...Jason couldn't refuse me
a place on the ship either.

21:28.932 --> 21:34.687
After all, he might need brains
as well as brawn.

21:36.272 --> 21:38.440
Shall we compete?

21:42.612 --> 21:44.488
Discus?

21:49.160 --> 21:50.869
Come on.

21:56.836 --> 21:59.087
- See that rock?
- Yes.

21:59.255 --> 22:01.756
No thrower has ever reached it.

22:01.924 --> 22:05.385
And is the contest to hit it
or pass it?

22:09.849 --> 22:11.891
You'll be lucky if you get halfway.

22:12.059 --> 22:14.144
- Now, go on.
- No, after you, Hercules.

22:14.311 --> 22:17.188
I've never thrown a discus before.

22:17.356 --> 22:20.316
I'd like to see how it's done.

22:58.148 --> 23:01.984
Let Hylas have his moment of triumph
while he may.

23:02.903 --> 23:05.112
You shall have your place, Hylas.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.198
Hail Hylas!

23:07.365 --> 23:10.493
I have found the finest crew
in all Greece.

23:10.660 --> 23:13.829
Now for a ship
that is worthy of them.

23:20.712 --> 23:21.796
Argos.

23:23.548 --> 23:25.883
- Argos.
- Hello?

23:26.051 --> 23:27.927
Is that you, Argos?

23:29.054 --> 23:31.347
- Who's there?
- It's Jason.

23:32.015 --> 23:33.891
Come aboard.

23:54.871 --> 23:56.455
So you've come back again.

23:56.623 --> 23:58.792
She's a fine ship.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.710
Yes.

24:02.046 --> 24:05.173
She is a fine ship.
She's ready to sail.

24:05.341 --> 24:07.008
We've yet to give her a name.

24:07.552 --> 24:11.304
I'll call her the Argo,
after her builder.

24:12.765 --> 24:14.724
The Argo?

24:15.893 --> 24:18.728
Well, you'd better have a look
at the figurehead.

24:18.896 --> 24:22.649
It might make you change your mind.
No, this way.

24:22.817 --> 24:25.443
- Is it forward?
- No, it's astern.

24:25.611 --> 24:26.903
We'll have to move it.

24:27.071 --> 24:29.781
It's supposed to watch over
the water ahead of the vessel.

24:29.949 --> 24:34.911
I can't help that.
Something made me put it here.

24:40.918 --> 24:43.545
Hera, queen of the gods.

24:44.005 --> 24:47.007
- What?
- Nothing.

24:47.592 --> 24:49.050
You don't object to it here?

24:50.469 --> 24:53.096
- No.
- Nor do I.

24:53.264 --> 24:57.642
It makes me feel someone friendly
is watching over us.

24:59.688 --> 25:02.648
- When do we sail?
- Tomorrow.

26:36.286 --> 26:37.411
Don't waste it.

26:37.578 --> 26:40.289
There isn't enough left
to make any difference, Jason.

26:40.456 --> 26:42.124
Oh, let him rest.

26:42.292 --> 26:45.585
But the sooner we find some island
with water, the better.

26:45.753 --> 26:48.297
We can't row much longer
on three sips a day.

26:48.464 --> 26:51.258
Take my advice. Put back to Icos.

26:51.426 --> 26:53.593
But we'd lose five days' sailing.

26:53.761 --> 26:55.554
We haven't water enough
for tomorrow...

26:55.722 --> 26:58.015
...let alone the time it would take
to reach Icos.

26:58.182 --> 27:01.936
Don't worry, Hylas.
I don't expect him to take my advice.

27:02.104 --> 27:04.564
But I wish he'd listen to someone.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.201
Still grumbling?

27:18.495 --> 27:20.705
Sailors always grumble.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.499
These sailors have something
to grumble about.

27:23.667 --> 27:25.960
Hardly any water. Blistered hands.

27:26.128 --> 27:28.463
- They should use brine.
- Brine?

27:28.630 --> 27:30.506
It toughens the skin.

27:30.674 --> 27:33.593
Well, go down and treat them.
I'll steer.

27:42.728 --> 27:44.270
Hera.

27:46.440 --> 27:49.525
You said you could help me
a certain number of times.

27:49.943 --> 27:51.611
So far, you've told me of Colchis.

27:52.321 --> 27:55.948
And I threw Pelias from his horse
and dragged him beneath the water.

27:56.116 --> 27:57.700
Pelias?

27:59.161 --> 28:01.413
So that was King Pelias.

28:01.581 --> 28:04.875
I know your need.
Set sail and steer north.

28:05.043 --> 28:07.294
- You will reach land at noon.
- Where?

28:07.462 --> 28:09.129
The Isle of Bronze.

28:09.798 --> 28:11.507
I've never heard of it.

28:11.674 --> 28:14.676
No mortal has.
It was the foundry of the gods.

28:14.844 --> 28:18.430
Hephaestus labored there,
making armor and weapons for Zeus.

28:18.598 --> 28:22.643
Oh, do not fear. Hephaestus himself
has long departed.

28:22.811 --> 28:25.479
I will see that you reach
the Isle of Bronze.

28:25.647 --> 28:28.816
But listen to me, Jason.
Listen very carefully.

28:39.953 --> 28:42.287
- Take the helm.
- Yes, sir.

28:43.123 --> 28:45.082
Set sail.

28:53.967 --> 28:55.801
We reach land at noon.

28:55.969 --> 28:59.388
Then you can fill your bellies until they
grumble as much as your tongues.

28:59.556 --> 29:00.682
Now, mark this.

29:01.267 --> 29:03.476
It will be safe to take
food and water.

29:03.644 --> 29:08.022
But nothing else.
Absolutely nothing else.

29:08.816 --> 29:10.733
That doesn't include women?

29:10.901 --> 29:13.319
If there are any on the island,
yes, it does.

29:13.487 --> 29:16.823
If I meet a girl with a firm leg,
a full bosom and a warm heart...

29:16.991 --> 29:19.492
...let no man try and stop me.

29:19.660 --> 29:22.287
- Talos will.
- Who's Talos?

29:22.705 --> 29:24.998
You do mean there's a man there
who wants a fight?

29:25.166 --> 29:26.499
I spoke of no man.

29:26.667 --> 29:30.378
Food and water, Hercules.
That's all.

29:31.922 --> 29:34.966
Jason, who told you of this island?

29:35.676 --> 29:38.553
The goddess Hera.

30:08.418 --> 30:10.336
Port helm.

30:11.713 --> 30:13.631
Steady as you go.

30:14.174 --> 30:16.383
Furl the sail.

30:44.704 --> 30:47.414
Ashore for food and water.

30:59.219 --> 31:02.722
- Are goats good sailors?
- Goats? What are you talking about?

31:02.890 --> 31:05.058
What do you want with goats
onboard ship?

31:05.226 --> 31:07.978
Well, some of us might be hungry...

31:08.145 --> 31:10.188
...or thirsty.

31:11.023 --> 31:12.732
Come on.

31:21.534 --> 31:23.201
Here's one for the pot.

31:31.085 --> 31:33.086
Hercules.

31:53.691 --> 31:55.650
Isn't he one of the Titans?

31:55.818 --> 31:58.528
He might be. He's big enough.

32:02.366 --> 32:06.203
Didn't Jason say something
about Talos?

32:16.131 --> 32:19.800
This must be where Hephaestus
molded the statues of the gods.

32:19.968 --> 32:24.722
Yes. And set them up
for all the world to see.

32:43.116 --> 32:44.992
Hercules.

33:23.032 --> 33:25.158
It's a treasure chamber.

33:25.743 --> 33:28.704
The treasure chamber of the gods.

33:33.126 --> 33:34.793
Look at this.

33:34.961 --> 33:37.003
And this.

33:37.171 --> 33:38.797
A pearl.

33:38.965 --> 33:40.298
It's a javelin.

33:40.466 --> 33:43.301
Don't be silly. In a jewel box?

33:43.469 --> 33:45.721
It's a brooch pin.

33:45.930 --> 33:48.807
Well, whatever it is,
it'll make a useful weapon.

33:48.975 --> 33:50.434
Let's get back to the ship.

33:50.601 --> 33:53.812
- Hercules.
- Well, what is it?

33:53.980 --> 33:56.231
- You'd better put it back.
- Why?

33:56.941 --> 34:00.819
- Remember what Jason said?
- It won't be missed.

34:02.155 --> 34:05.158
Anyway, if the gods leave all this
lying about unguarded...

34:05.325 --> 34:08.119
...they obviously don't want it.
Come on.

34:56.210 --> 34:58.544
It must have been the wind.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.889
And you saw nothing of them
after that?

35:52.016 --> 35:54.017
Perhaps Hercules found a woman
after all.

36:03.611 --> 36:05.112
Talos.

37:59.229 --> 38:02.731
- Back water.
- Back. Back water.

38:02.899 --> 38:04.358
Back.

39:39.539 --> 39:43.334
I warned you, Jason.
This is Hercules' doing.

39:43.502 --> 39:46.504
Talos will try to kill all of you.

39:46.671 --> 39:47.713
How can I fight him?

39:47.881 --> 39:50.800
Think before you waste
the gift of the gods.

39:50.967 --> 39:53.594
Against a man of bronze,
our weapons are useless.

39:53.762 --> 39:55.262
I repeat that question.

39:55.430 --> 39:57.014
Then I must answer it.

39:57.182 --> 40:01.018
Fight Talos with your wits
rather than your courage.

40:01.186 --> 40:03.395
And look to his ankles.

40:03.563 --> 40:04.772
His ankles?

40:05.273 --> 40:08.360
There is nothing else I can tell you.

40:56.242 --> 40:57.784
Jason.

40:57.952 --> 40:59.870
You disobeyed my order.

41:13.927 --> 41:16.596
Lure him to these rocks,
but stay out of reach.

41:16.763 --> 41:19.056
- And what will you do?
- I shall hide here, Acastus.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.560
I shall do my very best
to send him to you, Jason.

41:22.728 --> 41:24.061
My very best.

42:40.390 --> 42:42.266
Mind his foot!

44:32.545 --> 44:34.671
Quick, get back to the rocks.

44:41.846 --> 44:43.430
Hylas.

44:47.310 --> 44:49.520
Hercules, you've left your...

46:04.763 --> 46:08.016
- Well?
- We searched, Argos.

46:08.184 --> 46:10.268
And I will search again.

46:10.436 --> 46:14.106
Hylas was with us.
We saw him running.

46:14.274 --> 46:17.067
But then he disappeared.

46:17.235 --> 46:20.529
He could've been hurt,
not able to get back to the ship.

46:20.697 --> 46:24.158
Like Palinuros.
We had to carry him aboard.

46:25.827 --> 46:28.037
Hercules, Hylas is dead.

46:31.166 --> 46:32.541
The gods decided it.

46:34.419 --> 46:37.213
Why kill a boy for my grave fault?

46:39.257 --> 46:41.592
But I should have stayed with him.

46:41.760 --> 46:45.513
Search until nightfall.
We won't sail till then.

46:54.022 --> 46:56.232
Sail when you please, Jason.

46:56.399 --> 46:59.777
I cannot leave this island
till I've found Hylas.

47:18.589 --> 47:20.632
Jason.

47:20.800 --> 47:24.553
Will you abandon Hercules,
the best man among us?

47:24.720 --> 47:28.181
- I, for one, won't sail without him.
- Nor shall I.

47:28.349 --> 47:30.600
Nor I.

47:31.978 --> 47:32.978
Come with me.

47:33.145 --> 47:36.314
Hylas!

47:47.159 --> 47:49.452
Is there any man here
who does not obey the gods?

47:51.664 --> 47:56.626
We will do as the goddess Hera
commands, if she will speak to us.

48:01.340 --> 48:03.341
This is your last chance, Jason.

48:09.765 --> 48:12.517
The last time that I can help you.

48:12.685 --> 48:14.145
I understand.

48:15.105 --> 48:16.939
Then know this, Argonauts.

48:17.107 --> 48:19.483
- Hylas is dead.
- Hylas is dead.

48:19.651 --> 48:23.362
As for Hercules, he is not fated
to go further with the Argo.

48:23.530 --> 48:25.531
Zeus has other tasks for him.

48:25.991 --> 48:28.075
And for us, Hera?

48:28.243 --> 48:32.371
Sail to Phrygia.
Seek out Phineas, the blinded man.

48:32.539 --> 48:34.832
Only he can guide you now.

48:38.879 --> 48:40.046
We set sail.

48:43.967 --> 48:47.219
Come on, back to your places.

48:50.557 --> 48:53.893
Back to your places.
Get forward there.

50:28.490 --> 50:30.908
Go away!

50:33.454 --> 51:14.035
Devils! Demons!

51:43.858 --> 51:47.611
Lord Zeus, I was a sinner.

51:47.779 --> 51:50.989
I've never tried to deny it.

51:51.157 --> 51:54.576
But I didn't sin every day.

51:55.578 --> 51:58.914
Why, then,
do you punish me every day?

52:17.977 --> 52:20.478
What in the name of the gods
are they?

52:37.955 --> 52:39.539
Jason.

52:48.340 --> 52:50.675
- Are you Phineas?
- Yes.

52:50.843 --> 52:53.011
Take my arm. I can't see yours.

52:53.178 --> 52:54.971
Don't flinch.

52:58.309 --> 53:01.978
Zeus gave me the gift of prophecy,
but I misused it...

53:02.146 --> 53:04.272
...so I was blinded.

53:04.440 --> 53:07.817
Zeus ordered the Harpies
to torment me.

53:08.402 --> 53:12.155
You, Jason, now listen to me.

53:12.489 --> 53:16.701
The gods have ordered me to tell you
whatever you want to know.

53:17.245 --> 53:19.997
But the gods have gone
too far with me.

53:20.165 --> 53:25.002
They can punish a man so much,
and then one day he abandons them.

53:25.170 --> 53:26.921
He says, "All right, Zeus.

53:27.088 --> 53:30.841
Throw a thunderbolt.
Let the earth swallow me.

53:31.009 --> 53:32.092
I defy you."

53:35.764 --> 53:38.766
You growl away all you like, Zeus.

53:38.934 --> 53:42.186
I mean what I say. Jason.

53:42.354 --> 53:44.730
I'll tell you
what you want to know...

53:44.898 --> 53:47.399
...only if you'll meet my price.

53:47.567 --> 53:49.318
What is your price then?

53:49.486 --> 53:51.904
Free me from these
tormenting Harpies.

53:52.072 --> 53:54.239
If Zeus sent those creatures
to plague him...

53:54.407 --> 53:56.283
...we'd be unwise to interfere.

53:56.451 --> 53:58.619
That's my price.

53:58.787 --> 54:00.871
Then we'll meet it, Phineas.

54:01.039 --> 54:03.749
We'll make you
the master of the Harpies.

56:29.732 --> 56:31.858
Get to the ropes!

56:41.536 --> 56:42.828
Now.

57:00.721 --> 57:02.305
Castor. Phalerus.

57:02.849 --> 57:04.391
Find some wood to build a cage.

57:14.152 --> 57:15.986
Here you are, you hungry fellow.

57:16.154 --> 57:19.156
A big fish for you
and some more wine.

57:22.286 --> 57:25.872
Well, Phineas, we've completed
our part of the bargain.

57:26.039 --> 57:28.583
- What is it you want to know?
- The way to Colchis.

57:29.293 --> 57:32.128
The way to Colchis
is through the Clashing Rocks.

57:32.296 --> 57:34.964
Steer northwest
and you'll reach them in five days.

57:35.132 --> 57:36.174
Northwest, eh?

57:36.967 --> 57:39.302
After the Clashing Rocks,
you turn northeast.

57:39.469 --> 57:42.305
Before long, you'll sight
the shores of Colchis.

57:42.472 --> 57:44.932
But tell me, what gods protect you?

57:45.475 --> 57:47.351
None now.

57:48.228 --> 57:50.605
Then you won't pass
the Clashing Rocks.

57:50.772 --> 57:54.775
- What are the Clashing Rocks?
- They speak for themselves, don't they?

57:56.028 --> 57:58.571
All I can offer you is this.

57:58.780 --> 58:01.574
It's not much reward
for what you've done...

58:01.867 --> 58:03.951
...but it's all I have.

58:07.873 --> 58:11.167
If that's all you can tell us,
then goodbye.

58:12.294 --> 58:14.462
The gods be merciful to you.

58:25.308 --> 58:28.727
Phineas, from now on, they'll witness
a banquet every night...

58:28.895 --> 58:31.313
...and eat the scraps you leave.

58:34.817 --> 58:36.777
Good appetite.

59:13.231 --> 59:15.565
There's not much water here.

59:42.553 --> 59:45.930
Steady as you go. Row easy.

59:53.897 --> 59:55.398
Easy, all.

59:55.899 --> 59:57.608
Easy, all!

01:00:30.143 --> 01:00:31.769
It's a narrow channel...

01:00:31.936 --> 01:00:34.396
...but I can't see what
made Phineas so frightened.

01:00:34.564 --> 01:00:36.440
It looks calm enough.

01:00:36.775 --> 01:00:38.442
Too calm.

01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:40.694
Acastus!

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:48.243
I know the sea god's moods.

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:51.789
But most of them are dangerous.

01:00:51.956 --> 01:00:54.625
Acastus, take a sounding.

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:58.462
The rest of you, be prepared to row
when I give the word.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:02.424
But an easy stroke.
Save your strength.

01:01:04.386 --> 01:01:06.512
They may need it later.

01:01:10.016 --> 01:01:15.896
Ship ahoy!

01:01:16.815 --> 01:01:19.024
There she is.

01:01:20.068 --> 01:01:22.236
She doesn't seem to be
in any great difficulty.

01:03:21.274 --> 01:03:23.150
A whole ship's crew.

01:03:23.318 --> 01:03:24.778
And Lynceus from the masthead.

01:03:25.196 --> 01:03:28.740
There was no hope of saving him,
not in that sea.

01:03:29.325 --> 01:03:31.284
Are we going through?

01:03:33.412 --> 01:03:36.206
- Yes.
- But it's...

01:03:36.749 --> 01:03:39.876
All right, we're going through.

01:03:40.044 --> 01:03:42.170
Back to your places.

01:03:47.343 --> 01:03:49.469
There's no turning back now.

01:03:49.637 --> 01:03:51.179
No, Acastus.

01:03:51.347 --> 01:03:53.348
There's no turning back
on this voyage.

01:03:53.516 --> 01:03:56.351
Drummer, beat out the stroke...

01:03:57.144 --> 01:03:59.521
...but keep it easy.

01:04:02.066 --> 01:04:03.817
The gods want their entertainment.

01:04:05.361 --> 01:04:06.778
Jason goes too far.

01:04:06.946 --> 01:04:11.199
Because he speaks the truth
when the gods themselves go too far?

01:04:58.248 --> 01:05:01.292
Turn back, Jason. We're trapped.

01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:05.463
- Trapped, Hera.
- It seems so.

01:05:06.548 --> 01:05:09.383
You've left me only one move.

01:05:18.393 --> 01:05:20.353
Pray to the gods, Jason.

01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.313
The gods of Greece are cruel.

01:05:24.566 --> 01:05:27.903
In time, all men
shall learn to do without them.

01:06:36.014 --> 01:06:39.183
Pull! Pull!

01:06:40.018 --> 01:06:42.186
Get back to your place.

01:06:59.371 --> 01:07:00.580
Pull!

01:07:00.748 --> 01:07:05.251
Pull till your hides crack
and your backs break.

01:07:05.419 --> 01:07:09.964
Pull!

01:07:50.423 --> 01:07:52.966
Keep the stroke going.

01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:17.323
Jason dared to speak
of the end of the gods...

01:08:17.492 --> 01:08:19.243
...and yet you let him live.

01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:24.665
If I were to punish every blasphemy,
I'd soon lose all loyalty and respect.

01:08:24.832 --> 01:08:26.917
You are the god of many men.

01:08:27.086 --> 01:08:29.254
Yet when those men
no longer believe in you...

01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:31.046
...then you'll return to nothing.

01:08:31.215 --> 01:08:35.551
You understand that,
and yet you remain with me.

01:08:35.719 --> 01:08:38.179
You think it weak of me, my lord?

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:40.430
Not weak.

01:08:40.599 --> 01:08:42.767
Almost human.

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:01.786
Whichever god or goddess
helped us...

01:09:01.953 --> 01:09:03.580
...is to be thanked.

01:09:03.747 --> 01:09:05.832
Those others weren't so fortunate.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.167
What's that?

01:09:49.461 --> 01:09:51.170
Who are you?

01:09:51.337 --> 01:09:52.837
Your ship was lost.

01:09:53.006 --> 01:09:55.966
We found only two other survivors.
They're being looked after.

01:09:56.134 --> 01:09:58.385
Here. Drink this.

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:03.390
When did you sail from Colchis?

01:10:03.558 --> 01:10:05.601
Dawn, this morning.

01:10:05.769 --> 01:10:07.436
Dawn?

01:10:08.355 --> 01:10:10.564
Then our journey is nearly over.

01:10:10.732 --> 01:10:13.275
- Where have you come from?
- Thessaly.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:15.611
But that's the other side
of the world.

01:10:16.905 --> 01:10:19.365
You don't look like a merchant.

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:23.035
Your vessel's a fighting ship.

01:10:23.203 --> 01:10:25.204
We'd be foolish to sail unarmed.

01:10:26.331 --> 01:10:30.168
By all accounts, your king, Aeetes,
fears the gods...

01:10:30.336 --> 01:10:32.879
...and we were sent by the gods.

01:10:33.047 --> 01:10:35.674
But I'm gonna talk to him alone,
peacefully.

01:10:36.092 --> 01:10:37.634
Now you answer a question.

01:10:37.802 --> 01:10:40.178
What was your ship doing
in such dangerous waters?

01:10:40.346 --> 01:10:43.556
We came to sacrifice
to the gods of the rocks...

01:10:43.724 --> 01:10:46.768
...to throw flowers onto the sea
to make it safe for our ships.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.564
I'm afraid our gods were angry,
not so powerful as yours.

01:10:51.732 --> 01:10:52.983
Are you a priestess?

01:10:54.318 --> 01:10:56.319
I serve in the temple of Hecate.

01:10:56.487 --> 01:10:58.571
A dancer.

01:10:58.739 --> 01:11:00.949
Is Hecate the god of the Colchians?

01:11:01.117 --> 01:11:02.242
The goddess.

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:05.078
But I'd heard they worship
some strange idol...

01:11:05.246 --> 01:11:06.871
...the skull and skin of a ram.

01:11:07.039 --> 01:11:08.415
No ordinary ram.

01:11:08.582 --> 01:11:12.127
Its fleece is of gold.
A gift of the gods themselves...

01:11:12.294 --> 01:11:15.547
...and it's brought our city
great peace and prosperity.

01:11:15.715 --> 01:11:18.425
We'll put you ashore
at dawn tomorrow.

01:11:18.592 --> 01:11:21.469
Perhaps you will show me
the way to the city.

01:11:21.637 --> 01:11:24.472
Now, tell me your name.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.391
Medea.

01:11:26.559 --> 01:11:28.810
And you can answer
my first question.

01:11:29.604 --> 01:11:31.647
- Who are you?
- My name is Jason.

01:11:41.616 --> 01:11:44.452
Within a few hours,
we shall sight Colchis.

01:11:44.619 --> 01:11:46.829
I'm coming in quietly by night.

01:11:46.997 --> 01:11:49.749
Now the voyage is over,
I don't want the trouble to begin.

01:11:49.916 --> 01:11:51.834
Won't be any trouble, Jason.

01:11:52.002 --> 01:11:54.587
Just tell us where the city is
and when we attack.

01:11:55.005 --> 01:11:56.422
We don't attack.

01:11:56.590 --> 01:12:00.134
But that's foolish. You have
the finest fighting men in the world.

01:12:00.302 --> 01:12:02.094
Forty fighting men against a nation?

01:12:02.262 --> 01:12:04.013
Better 40 than one, Jason.

01:12:04.181 --> 01:12:05.723
We're not pirates, Phalerus.

01:12:05.891 --> 01:12:09.018
What's that girl done to you?
We thought you were a fighting man.

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.938
I'm going up alone in the morning
to see what the situation is.

01:12:13.106 --> 01:12:17.151
Oh, you mean spy out the land.
Well, why alone?

01:12:17.319 --> 01:12:19.070
Why not take a few of us scouting?

01:12:19.237 --> 01:12:22.323
The fewer who go,
the less can get caught.

01:12:22.491 --> 01:12:25.117
- What's the fewest you can think of?
- One, of course.

01:12:25.285 --> 01:12:27.119
Right. I accept your advice.

01:12:27.287 --> 01:12:28.829
But I don't.

01:12:28.997 --> 01:12:32.000
Having sailed this far together,
we're free to speak our minds.

01:12:32.168 --> 01:12:34.127
And what's on yours, Acastus?

01:12:34.295 --> 01:12:37.214
We nose our way upstream,
rush the guards and seize the fleece.

01:12:37.381 --> 01:12:40.467
We'd be out into the open sea
while Aeetes is still asleep.

01:12:40.635 --> 01:12:42.427
- A night attack?
- Yes.

01:12:42.595 --> 01:12:45.847
And in the dark, during the attack,
a man will die.

01:12:46.015 --> 01:12:47.099
That man will be me.

01:12:47.642 --> 01:12:48.975
A javelin in my back.

01:12:49.143 --> 01:12:52.020
A Greek javelin, Acastus.
Maybe your javelin.

01:12:52.188 --> 01:12:54.773
- You'll die for that, Jason.
- Keep back.

01:14:10.726 --> 01:14:13.019
Euphemus.

01:14:34.584 --> 01:14:37.628
It's Euphemus. He's dead.

01:14:41.466 --> 01:14:45.219
Look at this. Slashed and bloody.

01:14:46.471 --> 01:14:48.805
Acastus must be
at the bottom of the sea.

01:14:48.973 --> 01:14:50.515
I wonder.

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:53.435
- Make sail.
- And Euphemus?

01:14:53.603 --> 01:14:56.355
The sea was his kingdom
while he was alive.

01:14:56.522 --> 01:14:58.273
Let it take his body now he's dead.

01:14:58.441 --> 01:15:00.484
Make sail.

01:15:00.944 --> 01:15:03.028
Make sail!

01:15:08.409 --> 01:15:10.327
You're wounded.

01:15:11.371 --> 01:15:15.165
We have a flower in Colchis
which heals and soothes.

01:15:15.667 --> 01:15:17.292
Tomorrow, I'll show you.

01:15:27.345 --> 01:15:28.762
What do you call the flower?

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:31.682
It has no name.
It grows on a double stalk.

01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:34.519
They say it sprang
from the blood of Prometheus.

01:15:34.687 --> 01:15:39.440
And it has been used over the years
for its soothing and curing powers.

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.529
The sun's getting higher.
We must be on our way.

01:15:44.697 --> 01:15:46.364
Follow the road to the east.

01:15:46.532 --> 01:15:48.199
You're not coming further?

01:15:48.367 --> 01:15:50.535
I go another way.

01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.166
The goddess Hecate has spoken.

01:18:41.501 --> 01:18:44.378
There will be one among us today...

01:18:44.546 --> 01:18:47.715
...from the ends of the world.

01:18:48.383 --> 01:18:50.801
His name is Jason.

01:18:50.969 --> 01:18:54.472
Any man of whom he asks his way...

01:18:54.639 --> 01:18:55.806
...shall say this:

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:59.393
"Aeetes, king of Colchis...

01:18:59.561 --> 01:19:02.563
...awaits him
in the temple of Hecate."

01:19:03.899 --> 01:19:07.610
And that is all
any man shall say to him.

01:19:13.074 --> 01:19:14.283
Come forward, Jason.

01:19:30.425 --> 01:19:33.219
You have done all of us
a great service.

01:19:33.386 --> 01:19:35.013
Tonight, we shall feast you.

01:19:35.681 --> 01:19:39.184
We know of your great heroism,
and it deserves celebration.

01:19:39.352 --> 01:19:42.354
Return, then, to your companions
and bring them to my palace.

01:19:42.522 --> 01:19:44.523
I thank you, my lord...

01:19:44.982 --> 01:19:47.359
...but I do not understand.

01:19:51.072 --> 01:19:54.282
- Medea?
- Welcome to Colchis.

01:20:15.846 --> 01:20:20.100
I give you Jason and the Argonauts.

01:20:20.268 --> 01:20:23.144
Jason and the Argonauts!

01:20:28.317 --> 01:20:31.403
Tell me, Jason,
why did you come to Colchis?

01:20:32.029 --> 01:20:33.947
In peace.

01:20:34.115 --> 01:20:36.993
I said "why," not "how."

01:20:37.578 --> 01:20:39.954
Altogether,
how many men have you?

01:20:40.122 --> 01:20:41.581
Enough.

01:20:41.748 --> 01:20:44.166
And you say you do not
threaten us?

01:20:44.334 --> 01:20:47.336
Envoys who come to me in deceit
remain in death.

01:20:48.714 --> 01:20:51.132
I know you've come for the fleece.

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:54.760
I know, too, that if you cannot win it
by bargaining, you plan to steal it.

01:20:55.429 --> 01:20:57.513
But we'll never part with it, Jason.

01:20:57.681 --> 01:21:00.182
It is a gift of the gods.

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:02.643
It has brought wealth and peace
to Colchis.

01:21:02.811 --> 01:21:05.646
Should we ever let it go,
it would mean plague and famine...

01:21:05.814 --> 01:21:07.523
...and the destruction
of our country!

01:21:08.025 --> 01:21:10.526
We can no longer welcome
or entertain you...

01:21:10.694 --> 01:21:12.528
...but treat you as you deserve.

01:21:12.696 --> 01:21:14.655
As thieves...

01:21:14.823 --> 01:21:16.991
...as pirates...

01:21:17.576 --> 01:21:20.411
...as murderers.

01:21:26.043 --> 01:21:29.211
We give our thanks to one person.

01:21:30.339 --> 01:21:34.800
The person who exposed
a criminal attempt on our kingdom:

01:21:35.928 --> 01:21:39.723
The son of King Pelias
of Thessaly...

01:21:39.891 --> 01:21:42.017
...Acastus.

01:21:44.479 --> 01:21:46.229
Hail!

01:22:12.882 --> 01:22:15.926
Hecate, queen of darkness...

01:22:16.094 --> 01:22:17.969
...you've always helped me.

01:22:18.137 --> 01:22:20.555
Tell me now what I must do.

01:22:21.265 --> 01:22:25.268
You, who gave me
the gift of foresight...

01:22:25.436 --> 01:22:28.939
...why didn't you reveal to me
Acastus' treachery?

01:22:29.774 --> 01:22:32.943
He who sits drinking with Aeetes...

01:22:33.111 --> 01:22:35.237
...while Jason...

01:22:35.405 --> 01:22:39.784
...imprisoned, condemned to death.

01:22:40.369 --> 01:22:44.038
If I help him now
in the quest for the fleece...

01:22:45.416 --> 01:22:48.626
...I shall be a traitor to my country...

01:22:49.294 --> 01:22:52.255
...and to you, Hecate.

01:22:55.426 --> 01:22:57.385
And if not...

01:22:59.638 --> 01:23:01.597
...to myself.

01:23:05.185 --> 01:23:07.979
Help me, Hecate.

01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:45.350
Medea.

01:23:45.518 --> 01:23:48.520
Why did you come here?
Was it Aeetes who sent you?

01:23:48.688 --> 01:23:50.814
I came to ask you
to give up your quest...

01:23:50.982 --> 01:23:53.817
...and sail away
with the Argonauts in peace.

01:23:54.569 --> 01:23:55.736
Never return.

01:23:55.904 --> 01:23:57.654
Never to think
of the Golden Fleece?

01:23:57.822 --> 01:23:59.364
Never to think of the fleece.

01:23:59.532 --> 01:24:01.158
Then it was Aeetes.

01:24:01.785 --> 01:24:04.703
You tell him I will fulfill the task
the gods have sent me...

01:24:04.871 --> 01:24:08.749
...and never betray the Argonauts,
whatever he offers me.

01:24:09.542 --> 01:24:12.544
Even if it's Medea,
high priestess of Hecate.

01:24:12.712 --> 01:24:13.796
Please...

01:24:14.839 --> 01:24:19.718
...forget the Golden Fleece.
I fear for your safety.

01:24:21.721 --> 01:24:24.890
If you're set on carrying it away...

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:27.559
...I must come with you.

01:24:28.895 --> 01:24:30.145
I'll go alone.

01:24:31.397 --> 01:24:32.898
No.

01:24:33.566 --> 01:24:36.777
I have to go with you.
I have no country now.

01:24:38.823 --> 01:24:40.740
And I love you.

01:24:57.716 --> 01:25:00.802
Castor, Phalerus, Dmitrius,
get to the door.

01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:03.429
The rest of you,
back to your places.

01:25:08.435 --> 01:25:10.937
- The priestess.
- Argos, listen to Medea.

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:14.148
When you're clear of the palace,
go to the ship and row downstream.

01:25:14.316 --> 01:25:17.026
There's a break in the cliff
and a path through the woods.

01:25:17.194 --> 01:25:19.737
Anchor there. We'll join you.

01:25:37.798 --> 01:25:39.341
Well, what is it?

01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:42.344
- Jason has escaped.
- And his men?

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:45.973
They were all gone. I was making
my rounds, found the guards drugged.

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:49.351
Drugged?
Then there's an accomplice.

01:25:49.519 --> 01:25:52.313
- Where's Acastus?
- He's not in his quarters.

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.357
Acastus help Jason?

01:25:55.525 --> 01:25:58.152
But there's no reason to it.

01:25:59.362 --> 01:26:01.989
Unless it was Medea
who mixed the drug.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:03.991
The high priestess of Hecate?

01:26:04.159 --> 01:26:07.161
I saw how Medea looked at Jason.

01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:12.666
If Medea's helping them, then she's
guiding them to the Golden Fleece...

01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:15.336
...and the Argonauts will take ship.

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:17.212
The landward way is shorter.

01:26:17.380 --> 01:26:20.007
Muster your men, captain.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:57.212
Listen.

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:01.216
Soldiers.

01:27:01.968 --> 01:27:04.386
Phalerus, Castor,
you come with me.

01:27:04.553 --> 01:27:06.346
- No, not you, Polydeuces.
- But, Argos...

01:27:06.514 --> 01:27:09.557
You stay aboard with the rest
of the men and guard the ship.

01:31:04.672 --> 01:31:10.594
Jason.

01:31:14.098 --> 01:31:15.807
Aeetes and the Colchians.

01:31:16.434 --> 01:31:19.436
We heard them from the ship.
They must be somewhere near.

01:31:22.315 --> 01:31:24.024
Get the fleece.

01:32:22.084 --> 01:32:24.210
Guards, follow them up there
and that way.

01:32:27.381 --> 01:32:29.007
Wait.

01:32:40.728 --> 01:32:42.812
Hecate, queen of darkness...

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.941
...revenge yourself
against the Thessalians.

01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:49.403
Deliver to me the children
of the Hydra's teeth...

01:32:49.571 --> 01:32:51.572
...the children of the night.

01:33:37.702 --> 01:33:41.663
The teeth.
Fetch me the Hydra's teeth, quickly.

01:34:07.316 --> 01:34:09.984
Against the children
of the Hydra's teeth...

01:34:10.152 --> 01:34:12.946
...there is no protection.

01:35:05.083 --> 01:35:08.377
The fleece. Give me the fleece.

01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:12.089
It has the power to heal.

01:35:41.411 --> 01:35:44.246
It's true.
It does have the power to heal.

01:36:06.938 --> 01:36:09.022
Jason!

01:36:10.233 --> 01:36:13.860
Hold the guards back, captain,
or they may die...

01:36:14.028 --> 01:36:15.904
...killed with Jason and his pirates.

01:36:39.136 --> 01:36:42.472
Rise up, you dead,
slain of the Hydra.

01:36:43.599 --> 01:36:47.186
Rise from your graves
and avenge us.

01:36:47.354 --> 01:36:52.149
Those who steal the Golden Fleece
must die.

01:37:26.351 --> 01:37:28.144
Argos, get down to the ship.

01:37:28.312 --> 01:37:30.771
- Take Medea.
- Come with me.

01:37:48.541 --> 01:37:50.042
There.

01:37:57.216 --> 01:37:58.759
And there.

01:38:04.057 --> 01:38:05.807
And still another.

01:38:07.894 --> 01:38:09.561
Wait.

01:38:13.733 --> 01:38:15.359
And more.

01:38:40.259 --> 01:38:42.761
Destroy them!

01:38:45.056 --> 01:38:47.265
Kill!

01:38:47.893 --> 01:38:51.396
Kill, kill, kill them all!

01:39:56.421 --> 01:39:58.172
Get back.

01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:45.591
I think that proves at last
that I'm a worthy opponent, my lord.

01:42:45.759 --> 01:42:46.926
Where are you going?

01:42:47.093 --> 01:42:50.847
- To clear the board. The game is over.
- It certainly is not.

01:43:01.567 --> 01:43:04.861
For the moment
let them enjoy a calm sea...

01:43:05.029 --> 01:43:07.614
...a fresh breeze and each other.

01:43:07.782 --> 01:43:11.284
The girl is pretty,
and I was always sentimental.

01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:16.790
But for Jason
there are other adventures.

01:43:16.958 --> 01:43:18.917
I have not yet finished with Jason.

01:43:20.544 --> 01:43:24.381
Let us continue the game
another day.
