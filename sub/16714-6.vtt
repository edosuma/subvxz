00:00.915 --> 00:02.214
[Girl grunts]

00:02.969 --> 00:05.403
Like that, ok?

00:05.405 --> 00:08.173
First you want to go under...

00:08.175 --> 00:09.641
Yeah.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.142
And then kind of hold it up

00:11.144 --> 00:12.644
so they get back to us.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.679
Right.

00:14.681 --> 00:19.851
Older boy: Guys, guys, you
should have been home an hour ago.

00:19.853 --> 00:24.189
Now Mom's sitting there
with Dad waiting on you.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.458
Did you forget Dad was coming?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.293
Boy: We don't want to go
to his place this weekend.

00:28.295 --> 00:31.095
Well, we don't get a say in it.

00:31.097 --> 00:33.565
Girl: Is Shelley with them?

00:34.601 --> 00:38.203
No, she's not.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.538
You know she's gonna
show up at some point.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.173
Girl: She says mean things about mom.

00:42.175 --> 00:44.108
[Sighs] I know.

00:44.110 --> 00:47.045
I know.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.181
But it's his weekend.

00:53.854 --> 00:59.224
Maybe we'll go to the
movies like we did last time.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.493
That wasn't so bad.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.801
Come on.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.376
You want to race?

01:18.378 --> 01:20.845
Boy: You're on a bike. You'll win.

01:20.847 --> 01:23.915
You guys got a head start
if you cut through the corn.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.550
Unless you two are chicken.

01:25.552 --> 01:28.119
Bawk bawk bawk bawk!

01:28.121 --> 01:29.754
Girl: Come on, let's go!

01:29.756 --> 01:33.024
Last one home's a loser!

01:56.283 --> 01:58.049
Allie!

01:58.051 --> 02:00.151
Where are you?!

02:00.153 --> 02:02.921
I'm over here!

02:07.794 --> 02:10.562
Allie!

02:10.564 --> 02:12.096
Allie, where are you?!

02:12.098 --> 02:14.032
I'm over here!

02:17.170 --> 02:19.337
Ale: Look, he's hurt!

02:21.308 --> 02:24.242
Watch his little leg.

02:37.424 --> 02:39.290
Stop it.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.659
Dude, seriously, stop it.

02:41.661 --> 02:44.662
Come on, man, I'm
trying to tell a story.

02:45.975 --> 02:48.676
And then, that's when
the aliens snatched them.

02:48.676 --> 02:50.546
Ignore him. It wasn't aliens,

02:50.675 --> 02:53.409
it was the lunatic from the asylum.

02:53.411 --> 02:55.678
P.K., I said quit it.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.881
Then the oxen hill maniac kept
the twins chained up for days.

02:58.883 --> 03:01.784
He needed to fatten them
up before he ate them.

03:01.786 --> 03:03.986
I thought their older
brother killed them.

03:03.988 --> 03:05.188
Or that freak Jimmy Ridley.

03:05.190 --> 03:08.925
Tonight we solve the mystery.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.159
No backing out?

03:10.161 --> 03:12.895
P.K. and Bones: No backing out.

03:12.897 --> 03:15.732
So, uh, no phones, right?

03:15.734 --> 03:18.201
That was the point. Old school.

03:18.203 --> 03:19.168
No lifelines.

03:19.170 --> 03:22.071
Yeah, but you chickened out last year.

03:22.073 --> 03:23.172
Bones, what's your story?

03:23.174 --> 03:25.108
I said I was sleeping at your house.

03:25.110 --> 03:26.709
That's why the phone's there.

03:26.711 --> 03:28.344
My phone and I are at P.K.'s.

03:28.346 --> 03:30.313
So we're covered.

03:32.384 --> 03:35.184
As long as we're at my house
for pancakes in the morning.

03:35.186 --> 03:37.887
Ok, P.K., serious question...
Why are you always eating?

03:37.889 --> 03:40.556
'Cause I'm fracking hungry.

03:40.558 --> 03:42.358
Nutter butter, anyone?

03:42.360 --> 03:45.995
Sure. How long is this gonna take?

03:45.997 --> 03:49.265
Who cares? We got all night.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.408
Watch out for snakes.

03:58.410 --> 04:00.443
It's right here.

04:05.950 --> 04:07.216
Alvez: I'm dead serious.

04:07.218 --> 04:08.151
JJ: There's no way.

04:08.153 --> 04:10.186
The probability of that happening to you

04:10.188 --> 04:11.254
more than once is astounding.

04:11.256 --> 04:12.221
I know. I know.

04:12.223 --> 04:13.689
But I was there, ok,

04:13.691 --> 04:15.858
and I'm telling you, it was crazy.

04:15.860 --> 04:18.194
Thank God you guys are
here. What do you know?

04:18.196 --> 04:19.195
Nothing.

04:19.197 --> 04:20.663
Ok. Rossi got here

04:20.665 --> 04:22.130
crazy early, and then
right when Prentiss came in

04:22.132 --> 04:24.200
he pulled her in there.

04:26.838 --> 04:29.505
We need to talk.

04:33.912 --> 04:34.977
Ok, ok.

04:34.979 --> 04:37.013
What's going on?

04:38.249 --> 04:39.449
It's Hotch.

04:39.451 --> 04:41.384
Oh, my God. Is he ok?

04:41.386 --> 04:42.318
He's ok.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.487
But he has not been away

04:44.489 --> 04:45.955
on special assignment.

04:45.957 --> 04:47.390
That's something we had to say

04:47.392 --> 04:48.825
as a cover for the investigation.

04:48.827 --> 04:50.193
What investigation?

04:50.195 --> 04:51.861
Hotch saw Peter Lewis

04:51.863 --> 04:53.830
watching one of Jack's soccer games.

04:53.832 --> 04:57.233
By the time Hotch reacted,
Lewis had taken off.

04:57.235 --> 04:59.335
The Bureau searched the
area, but he disappeared.

04:59.337 --> 05:00.837
When was this?

05:00.839 --> 05:04.307
Days after Mr. Scratch
resurfaced in Arizona.

05:04.309 --> 05:07.844
One of the victims was chanting
his name when we found her.

05:07.846 --> 05:10.146
She had "Hotch" carved
into her forehead.

05:10.148 --> 05:11.581
It really got to him.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.182
Why didn't he tell us?
We could have focused

05:13.184 --> 05:14.517
on finding Mr. Scratch.

05:14.519 --> 05:16.018
He knows we can't drop everything.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.954
Also, he didn't want to worry everyone.

05:17.956 --> 05:20.990
So now what? They have
around-the-clock surveillance?

05:20.992 --> 05:22.258
Initially, yes.

05:22.260 --> 05:25.461
Agents were assigned to watch Jack 24/7.

05:25.463 --> 05:27.230
But when we were all in L.A.

05:27.232 --> 05:29.065
On the John David Bates case,

05:29.067 --> 05:31.234
Scratch surfaced again,

05:31.236 --> 05:33.736
this time at Jack's school.

05:33.738 --> 05:36.105
Going after Jack takes
this to a whole new level.

05:36.107 --> 05:38.140
Peter Lewis is not going to stop.

05:38.142 --> 05:39.876
Which is why Hotch and Jack

05:39.878 --> 05:41.344
have now entered the program.

05:41.346 --> 05:46.115
Witness Protection. Oh, ok, uh, wow.

05:46.117 --> 05:47.750
But now that this happened,

05:47.752 --> 05:51.187
we can drop everything and
focus on catching Mr. Scratch,

05:51.189 --> 05:52.388
and then Hotch can come back, right?

05:52.390 --> 05:55.491
He went away believing
that could happen.

05:55.493 --> 05:57.126
But things have changed.

05:57.128 --> 06:00.129
He's now decided that
he can't put himself

06:00.131 --> 06:02.632
and Jack in danger again.

06:02.634 --> 06:06.802
He just sent in his resignation.

06:06.804 --> 06:09.939
I know this is a lot to process.

06:09.941 --> 06:12.141
I mean, yeah, he's a great dad,

06:12.143 --> 06:14.677
and this is an impossible job,

06:14.679 --> 06:16.779
and we know how much tragedy he's had.

06:16.781 --> 06:20.149
He's had enough tragedy. But...

06:20.151 --> 06:23.185
Does this mean we're never going
to be able to talk to him again?

06:23.187 --> 06:24.754
We don't have a choice.

06:24.756 --> 06:26.822
It's not ideal, obviously.

06:26.824 --> 06:30.426
But as his friends, we have
to support his decision.

06:30.428 --> 06:32.995
The only way for Hotch
to guarantee Jack's safety

06:32.997 --> 06:34.630
is if they both stay off the grid.

06:34.632 --> 06:36.165
Rossi: And one more thing.

06:36.167 --> 06:40.136
Hotch spoke to the director
as to who should replace him.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.204
Don't worry, it won't be me.

06:42.206 --> 06:44.440
You know I'm allergic to paperwork.

06:45.543 --> 06:49.412
But Hotch's final request

06:49.414 --> 06:52.982
was that Emily Prentiss becomes

06:52.984 --> 06:54.584
the BAU's new bureau chief.

06:54.586 --> 06:56.719
Thank the universe for silver linings.

06:56.721 --> 07:01.324
Ok, I just heard about all of
this myself a few minutes ago.

07:01.326 --> 07:02.792
Congratulations, Emily.

07:02.794 --> 07:04.160
This'll be good, right?

07:04.162 --> 07:05.861
You kidding me? This'll be great.

07:05.863 --> 07:07.863
I am really happy for you.

07:07.865 --> 07:08.998
Thank you, guys,

07:09.000 --> 07:11.300
but I haven't exactly signed on yet.

07:11.302 --> 07:13.235
Everyone knows you
have a lot to consider,

07:13.237 --> 07:15.671
but the brass needs
an answer by tomorrow.

07:15.673 --> 07:16.806
Understood.

07:16.808 --> 07:18.507
I hate to interrupt
the bad news/good news

07:18.509 --> 07:19.842
with bad news/bad news,

07:19.844 --> 07:23.312
but we've got 3 missing
kids in Delaware.

07:52.477 --> 07:53.743
P.K.?

07:53.745 --> 07:55.945
Bones?

08:27.478 --> 08:29.779
- [Clank]
- [Josh gasps]

08:32.150 --> 08:34.350
No! Aah!

Rossi: "The strength of a family",

09:07.209 --> 09:08.708
"like the strength of an army,

09:08.710 --> 09:11.378
is in its loyalty to each other."

09:11.380 --> 09:13.513
Mario Puzo.

09:14.783 --> 09:17.617
There's a lot to process
before my first cup.

09:17.619 --> 09:18.952
Thank you.

09:18.954 --> 09:20.086
I can't believe he's
been dealing with this

09:20.088 --> 09:21.254
for weeks and we never knew.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.856
That part really doesn't surprise me.

09:22.858 --> 09:23.924
He's always kept things to himself.

09:23.926 --> 09:26.426
I guess it was just his
way of protecting us.

09:26.428 --> 09:28.094
If anyone targeted my boys,

09:28.096 --> 09:29.763
I'd do anything to keep them safe.

09:29.765 --> 09:30.931
I know.

09:30.933 --> 09:33.099
Are you ready to take
this for a test drive?

09:33.101 --> 09:34.401
Sure.

09:34.403 --> 09:37.204
It's a quick flight.
We should get started.

09:37.206 --> 09:39.606
Ok, my brain's a little lunky
from that intel earlier today.

09:39.608 --> 09:40.707
Is that just me?

09:40.709 --> 09:42.776
No? Good. Not good, but you know.

09:42.778 --> 09:45.212
Anyway, if you all
follow along on your, uh,

09:45.214 --> 09:46.580
what-you-call-it, your tablets.

09:46.582 --> 09:49.783
Uh, 3 missing teenage
Clayton, Delaware, boys

09:49.785 --> 09:52.652
are Bones Jarvis, Josh Harmon,

09:52.654 --> 09:54.354
and P.K. Riggins.

09:54.356 --> 09:55.422
Did you say Bones?

09:55.424 --> 09:56.790
Yeah. Coolest name ever, huh?

09:56.792 --> 09:58.458
Technically it's William,
but the Police chief says

09:58.460 --> 09:59.759
everyone calls him Bones.

09:59.761 --> 10:00.827
Lewis: When were they last seen?

10:00.829 --> 10:02.128
Around 9 p.m.

10:02.130 --> 10:03.163
That was over 12 hours ago.

10:03.165 --> 10:04.731
That gives the unsub
a massive head start.

10:04.733 --> 10:07.100
Yeah. And we've got
like a barrel of nothing.

10:07.102 --> 10:08.268
The boys took off on their bikes,

10:08.270 --> 10:09.636
but they left their cell phones at home,

10:09.638 --> 10:10.837
so there's no way to track them.

10:10.839 --> 10:12.839
Any prior history with these kids?

10:12.841 --> 10:14.174
No, nothing.

10:14.176 --> 10:15.942
They've never even been gone overnight.

10:15.944 --> 10:18.078
And apparently they spend
every weekend together

10:18.080 --> 10:20.080
either making or watching movies.

10:20.082 --> 10:21.615
There's a bit of a
haunted history in Clayton.

10:21.617 --> 10:24.918
Years ago a mental institution
burned down and inmates escaped.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.720
Legend has it those
that were never found

10:26.722 --> 10:28.288
moved into abandoned houses.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.423
Garcia, you should locate
some of those properties.

10:30.425 --> 10:32.125
Maybe the boys were
looking for inspiration.

10:32.127 --> 10:34.427
Also check into any
history of criminal activity

10:34.429 --> 10:36.162
focusing on crimes against children.

10:36.652 --> 10:38.953
Ok. But for the record,
I prefer getting spooked

10:38.953 --> 10:40.367
doing research on ghost stories.

10:40.721 --> 10:41.518
We all know the stats.

10:41.664 --> 10:43.970
If we don't find these kids
within the next 24 hours,

10:43.972 --> 10:46.373
we could be looking at body recovery.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.008
We can't let that happen.

10:53.808 --> 10:55.007
Thanks for coming.

10:55.009 --> 10:57.677
And, please, call me
Coop. Everybody here does.

10:57.679 --> 10:59.812
Rossi: Tell us about your town, Coop.

10:59.814 --> 11:02.448
Mm, good people, hard-working.

11:02.450 --> 11:04.691
I gotta tell you, it's a quiet place.

11:05.148 --> 11:08.141
It looks like we're just a few miles
from the old Oxen Hill mental asylum.

11:08.713 --> 11:11.113
Well, you know, that
place burned down in 1956.

11:11.115 --> 11:14.750
Ghosts are long gone.
There's a Walmart there now.

11:14.752 --> 11:16.185
Let me ask you this.
Do you think it's possible

11:16.187 --> 11:17.519
the boys were following the legend

11:17.521 --> 11:18.754
of what happened to all the inmates?

11:18.756 --> 11:20.856
It could be. The parents told me

11:20.858 --> 11:23.158
that the boys were into scary movies.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.593
My officers are taking
statements right now.

11:24.595 --> 11:26.395
Have your officers ever dealt with

11:26.397 --> 11:28.597
a missing children's
investigation before?

11:28.599 --> 11:30.933
I'm the only one that's
been here long enough.

11:30.935 --> 11:35.137
The last time anything like
this happened was back in 1983.

11:35.139 --> 11:37.139
That's when the Henson
twins went missing.

11:37.141 --> 11:38.974
How'd that turn out?

11:38.976 --> 11:40.109
We found some clothes.

11:40.111 --> 11:42.377
There were traces of blood.

11:42.379 --> 11:44.313
Um, we never found the bodies.

11:44.315 --> 11:46.648
How old were they when they disappeared?

11:46.650 --> 11:48.484
13.

11:48.486 --> 11:51.386
Is it possible this is the
same offender 33 years later?

11:51.388 --> 11:52.921
I thought the same thing.

11:52.923 --> 11:57.259
But all the suspects I
had back in '83 are dead.

11:57.261 --> 12:00.295
Yes, but two children
were abducted back then,

12:00.297 --> 12:02.231
3 now, in the same town?

12:02.233 --> 12:04.099
It's too similar to dismiss.

12:04.101 --> 12:06.168
The question is, if it
is the same offender,

12:06.170 --> 12:09.471
would he be strong enough
to kidnap 3 young boys?

12:09.473 --> 12:11.440
Maybe he has help.

12:11.442 --> 12:13.709
Or he could have been a young
offender when he struck before

12:13.711 --> 12:15.210
and he's just not as old as we think.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.246
Where were the Henson twins last seen?

12:17.248 --> 12:19.381
Off Route 7. I'll take you there,

12:19.383 --> 12:22.351
but somebody's gotta stay
here with the parents.

12:22.353 --> 12:23.552
They haven't left since I called you.

12:23.554 --> 12:27.055
Lewis and I will talk to them.

12:27.057 --> 12:29.992
Have your sons ever run off before?

12:29.994 --> 12:31.126
No.

12:31.128 --> 12:32.227
They're good kids.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.396
I don't know who would do this to them.

12:34.398 --> 12:35.664
Where might the boys have gone?

12:35.666 --> 12:37.900
It had to be some kind of adventure,

12:37.902 --> 12:41.737
because P.K., he shoved a bunch of
snacks in his bag before he left.

12:41.739 --> 12:44.840
He'd just had a growth spurt,
so I just thought he was hungry.

12:44.842 --> 12:47.409
My first guess was that
he lost track of time

12:47.411 --> 12:48.811
and got into making a movie.

12:48.813 --> 12:51.613
But then after we all talked
and found their cell phones,

12:51.615 --> 12:52.915
we knew that wasn't happening.

12:52.917 --> 12:55.484
Can we see their movies?

12:58.722 --> 13:00.756
Here you go.

13:00.758 --> 13:02.191
That's their latest one.

13:02.193 --> 13:04.226
Gonna be some kind of alien invasion

13:04.228 --> 13:05.863
when they're done with the effects.

13:07.665 --> 13:09.331
Josh, narrating: Aliens are among us.

13:09.333 --> 13:12.234
Careful. The aliens are nearby.

13:14.338 --> 13:17.306
Who knows who they are.

13:17.308 --> 13:21.710
They are lurking in plain sight.

13:21.712 --> 13:24.012
Run!

13:24.014 --> 13:27.416
Who's this guy at the
end, with the blue truck?

13:27.418 --> 13:31.253
Jimmy Ridley. He's been around forever.

13:31.255 --> 13:34.723
Do you think he has
something to do with it?

13:34.725 --> 13:36.325
We'll look into it.

13:40.197 --> 13:41.763
- [Line rings]
- Hello.

13:41.765 --> 13:44.900
Garcia, I need you to run a name for me.

13:44.902 --> 13:46.301
Jimmy Ridley.

13:47.137 --> 13:49.938
I have a James Edward Ridley

13:49.940 --> 13:52.207
of Clayton, actually 3 of them,

13:52.209 --> 13:54.209
uh, all from the same family tree.

13:54.211 --> 13:56.178
Senior and junior have passed on,

13:56.180 --> 13:58.680
but the third is still there.
He lives and works on the family farm.

13:58.682 --> 13:59.915
No priors.

13:59.917 --> 14:01.650
Ok. Thanks.

14:01.652 --> 14:05.821
So, um, how are you holding up?

14:06.757 --> 14:09.791
Well, you know how I am with change.

14:09.793 --> 14:12.027
Yeah. That's why I asked.

14:12.029 --> 14:14.630
[Chuckles]

14:14.632 --> 14:18.700
I keep trying to think of
the last thing I said to him,

14:18.702 --> 14:22.004
and I can't remember.

14:22.006 --> 14:24.106
It was probably something boring,

14:24.108 --> 14:27.009
like "yes, sir."

14:27.011 --> 14:31.079
But I don't know. I hope
it was more clever and kind,

14:31.081 --> 14:34.116
and I keep thinking, is that what
we're supposed to learn from this,

14:34.118 --> 14:36.485
like every time you get
off the phone with someone,

14:36.487 --> 14:38.887
you should say something
clever and connected?

14:38.889 --> 14:40.422
Is that what I'm supposed to learn?

14:40.424 --> 14:42.891
Because... 'cause you don't
know if it's the last thing

14:42.893 --> 14:44.459
you're ever going to
be able so say to them.

14:44.461 --> 14:46.595
I don't know. Maybe.

14:46.597 --> 14:49.031
Well, that's impossible and exhausting.

14:49.033 --> 14:51.466
And, you know, I'm pretty good with
the salutations and the signing off,

14:51.468 --> 14:53.635
but I cannot think of
something meaningful to say

14:53.637 --> 14:55.637
every time I get off
the phone with someone.

14:55.639 --> 14:58.006
That cannot be the lesson in this.

14:58.008 --> 14:59.341
I don't think we're gonna know

14:59.343 --> 15:01.543
what we're supposed
to learn for a while.

15:01.545 --> 15:03.011
That doesn't work for
me, Sir. I'm sorry,

15:03.013 --> 15:04.379
but, you know, I cross-check

15:04.381 --> 15:06.748
and I figure it out quickly.
That's my thing.

15:06.750 --> 15:07.916
I know.

15:07.918 --> 15:09.284
It's gonna get better.

15:09.286 --> 15:11.987
Well, I wish it would
hurry up and do that

15:11.989 --> 15:13.789
because this feels really rotten.

15:13.791 --> 15:15.357
Of course it does.

15:15.359 --> 15:16.825
Because it should.

15:16.827 --> 15:18.593
And right now you're thinking

15:18.595 --> 15:19.728
it's never gonna get better

15:19.730 --> 15:22.464
and that this is your new normal.

15:22.466 --> 15:24.066
But you'll adapt.

15:24.068 --> 15:25.867
We all will.

15:25.869 --> 15:28.136
Trust me, kiddo.

15:28.138 --> 15:30.038
I've been here before.

15:31.208 --> 15:32.507
Thanks.

15:32.509 --> 15:35.544
And I know you could have
found out from the locals

15:35.546 --> 15:38.280
about Jimmy Ridley.
I appreciate you checking up on me.

15:38.282 --> 15:39.614
You bet.

15:39.616 --> 15:40.882
Sir, one more thing.

15:40.884 --> 15:42.951
I love you.

15:44.888 --> 15:46.955
I love you, too, Penelope.

15:49.493 --> 15:51.526
[Breaks connection]

15:58.600 --> 16:02.256
Well, the story is that the twins
were racing their big brother home.

16:02.256 --> 16:05.915
And they split up and
the twins just vanished.

16:05.915 --> 16:08.649
And, uh, we searched this
whole area until winter.

16:09.439 --> 16:11.706
You know, a blizzard's the only thing

16:11.708 --> 16:13.527
that could stop the
diehards from looking.

16:13.789 --> 16:15.533
This town can't afford
another heartbreak.

16:15.996 --> 16:17.296
What's goin' on?

16:17.298 --> 16:20.532
There are 3 missing kids.

16:20.534 --> 16:23.502
We don't want any trouble.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.270
Looks like you got it anyhow.

16:27.007 --> 16:28.607
You need a ride home?

16:31.579 --> 16:34.213
No, sir, I do not need a ride home.

16:34.215 --> 16:36.014
I've been getting plenty of exercise

16:36.016 --> 16:37.883
since you took away my license.

16:37.885 --> 16:39.751
What are you guys, are
you FBI or something?

16:39.753 --> 16:41.520
Yeah.

16:42.856 --> 16:45.791
Coop, why didn't you
bring them in before?

16:47.027 --> 16:50.762
Oh, that's right. Because
you were too cocky back then.

16:50.764 --> 16:52.798
Now you're just lazy.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.932
Go home, Deeley.

16:53.934 --> 16:55.934
Deeley Henson?

16:57.438 --> 16:58.503
Yes.

16:58.505 --> 17:00.272
You were with your siblings that night.

17:01.875 --> 17:03.141
Sure was.

17:03.143 --> 17:05.042
Could we possibly ask
you a few questions?

17:05.045 --> 17:08.512
Nope. I'm done talkin'.

17:08.515 --> 17:11.016
Johnny and Allie are gone.

17:11.018 --> 17:12.384
Nothing's gonna change that.

17:12.386 --> 17:14.685
If this case has anything to
do with your brother and sister,

17:14.688 --> 17:15.686
you could really help us.

17:15.689 --> 17:18.157
Sorry, I just got nothin' left.

17:19.859 --> 17:22.493
That's the downside of
living in a small town.

17:22.496 --> 17:25.763
You know, rumors flew, people
accused Deeley of killing them.

17:25.766 --> 17:28.032
He became an outcast,
dropped out of school,

17:28.035 --> 17:30.902
started drinking to cover up the guilt.

17:30.904 --> 17:33.805
Surprised he's still standing.

17:33.807 --> 17:35.807
JJ: This was the boys last night.

17:35.809 --> 17:38.010
Security camera across from
the cornfield picked it up.

17:38.012 --> 17:40.112
If they were moving in that direction,

17:40.114 --> 17:43.415
it probably means they were tracking
the Henson twins' disappearance.

17:43.417 --> 17:44.850
It's kind of a local legend.

17:44.852 --> 17:47.219
Lewis: Anyone else see them?

17:47.221 --> 17:49.921
Alvez: It's hard to say,
but about two minutes later

17:49.923 --> 17:52.257
this pickup truck drove by.

17:52.259 --> 17:54.092
Coop: That's Jimmy Ridley.

17:54.094 --> 17:56.695
He's in a film the kids were making.

17:56.697 --> 17:57.896
What's his story?

17:57.898 --> 17:59.898
A hermit, mostly.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.633
Has a few run-ins now and then.

18:01.635 --> 18:05.537
We need to find out what he was
doing on that road last night.

18:15.282 --> 18:18.517
Josh! Get up, come on.

18:20.020 --> 18:24.022
Something flew right at me.
I think it was a ghost.

18:24.024 --> 18:25.757
Shut up. Someone's here.

18:25.759 --> 18:28.627
Listen.

19:25.519 --> 19:30.255
[Indistinct sound]

19:46.640 --> 19:49.408
[Whimpering]

20:09.854 --> 20:11.820
He's been stalking these kids.

20:11.822 --> 20:13.522
It shows a lot of patience.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.863
Reid: And intent to do harm.

20:14.863 --> 20:16.592
He has a lot of weapons at his disposal.

20:16.594 --> 20:19.695
Add extreme isolation to that and
we've got ourselves a time bomb.

20:19.697 --> 20:21.602
Looks like he was raised in this house.

20:21.602 --> 20:23.666
Yeah. By a hoarder.

20:23.668 --> 20:27.029
There are old photos of
the Henson twins, too.

20:27.582 --> 20:29.549
He could be involved
in the first abduction.

20:29.731 --> 20:31.940
He would have been 15 when
the Henson twins disappeared,

20:31.942 --> 20:33.776
the same exact age as
their brother Deeley.

20:33.778 --> 20:35.344
I wonder if the two of
them were friends back then.

20:35.346 --> 20:37.379
You think that brother's
ever gonna talk to us?

20:37.381 --> 20:40.115
I don't know. Look at this.

20:43.093 --> 20:46.628
Those kids are awful.

20:46.630 --> 20:48.296
Jimmy, what did you do?

20:49.399 --> 20:51.733
I taught them a lesson.

20:51.735 --> 20:53.336
Where are they?

20:54.438 --> 20:59.074
Why do you have pictures of these kids?

20:59.076 --> 21:01.810
They take pictures of me...

21:01.812 --> 21:05.080
So I started doing it back.

21:05.082 --> 21:07.048
What about the Henson kids?

21:07.050 --> 21:11.086
They used to cut through our property.

21:11.088 --> 21:18.259
We got them signs up, but no one cares.

21:18.261 --> 21:22.530
My dad used to take pictures
of everyone who trespassed.

21:23.834 --> 21:26.935
Since Coop don't do nothin' about it,

21:26.937 --> 21:28.435
we had to prove it ourselves.

21:28.648 --> 21:31.306
What about the Jarvis boy's helmet?

21:31.408 --> 21:32.741
Why was that inside your house?

21:32.743 --> 21:34.776
He left it there.

21:34.778 --> 21:36.378
When? When was this?

21:36.380 --> 21:37.279
Last night.

21:37.957 --> 21:39.548
Was he with his friends?

21:39.950 --> 21:40.917
Yeah.

21:41.846 --> 21:43.345
No one went inside your house?

No. No!

I'm sorry, Jimmy. I need
you to walk me through this.

Because I want to help you.

22:00.498 --> 22:02.731
Those boys, they were on your property,

22:02.733 --> 22:05.301
but no one came inside your house?

22:05.303 --> 22:07.803
That's right.

22:10.441 --> 22:14.109
I shot off a firecracker.

22:14.111 --> 22:19.748
I scared 'em so bad, his hat fell off.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.483
And I kept it.

22:24.155 --> 22:27.223

22:27.225 --> 22:29.258
No.

22:31.462 --> 22:34.029

enough to take 3 kids.

left our phones at home.

some freak was gonna grab us?

be in this frackin' hobbit hole.

have found this place.

23:44.135 --> 23:45.834
we couldn't find any sign of the kids.

23:45.836 --> 23:48.637
I think this guy's too simple
to be who we're looking for.

23:48.639 --> 23:50.572
We should take a closer
look at the Henson case.

23:50.574 --> 23:52.107
Who called it in back then?

23:52.109 --> 23:53.942
Their mom did, but she
died a few years ago.

23:53.944 --> 23:56.745
Their older brother Deeley
was with them that night.

23:56.747 --> 23:58.714
Yeah, we met him on the roadside.

23:58.716 --> 24:00.516
According to Coop, he lives across town

24:00.518 --> 24:03.218
and he went out of his
way to find us on Route 7.

24:03.220 --> 24:06.655
Sounds like he's trying to insert
himself into our investigation.

24:06.657 --> 24:08.924
Except when we asked
him to talk, he refused.

24:08.926 --> 24:10.426
Maybe it's time to give it another try.

24:10.428 --> 24:11.694
You want to take a ride?

24:11.696 --> 24:13.796
Sure.

24:13.798 --> 24:16.598
If Jimmy really I isn't our
unsub, we're back to one.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.767
Let's go dig up the Henson files.

24:18.769 --> 24:20.936
I'll buy you a cup of coffee on the way.

24:26.610 --> 24:27.976
What are you thinking?

24:27.978 --> 24:32.247
A lot of circumstantial
evidence against Jimmy Ridley,

24:32.249 --> 24:33.916
but I wanted to go over...

24:33.918 --> 24:35.417
I was actually wondering

24:35.419 --> 24:37.519
what you were thinking about staying.

24:37.521 --> 24:39.221
Oh. Right.

24:39.223 --> 24:43.659
Well, uh, more pros than cons.

24:43.661 --> 24:46.028
I love this group and the job, but...

24:46.030 --> 24:49.832
But you've got a life back
in London and a boyfriend.

24:49.834 --> 24:51.667
Yeah.

24:51.669 --> 24:52.801
Have you told him yet?

24:52.803 --> 24:54.403
Oh, I haven't had the chance.

24:54.405 --> 24:55.571
We jumped on the jet.

24:55.573 --> 24:57.306
You should call him.

24:57.308 --> 24:59.208
I will.

25:01.045 --> 25:04.246
You mean right this second.

25:04.248 --> 25:05.514
Yeah.

25:05.516 --> 25:07.716
[Chuckles]

25:12.123 --> 25:14.690
Hey. I hope I didn't wake you.

25:14.692 --> 25:16.191
Mr. Henson?

25:16.193 --> 25:18.360
Hi, we met earlier.

25:18.362 --> 25:20.396
My name is Dr. Spencer Reid.

25:20.398 --> 25:22.398
This is SSA Luke Alvez.

25:22.400 --> 25:26.168
Ah, pleasure to meet you, amigos.

25:26.170 --> 25:29.838
[Chuckles]

25:31.242 --> 25:32.908
[Cans rattle]

25:32.910 --> 25:34.777
How much have you had to drink today?

25:34.779 --> 25:37.880
A free man in my own
house. Why does that matter?

25:37.882 --> 25:40.215
I'm just thinking now is
not a great time to talk.

25:40.217 --> 25:42.017
I mean, you might not be yourself.

25:49.693 --> 25:51.693
What do you want to know?

25:52.596 --> 25:54.530
Tell us about 1983.

25:56.567 --> 25:58.033
What the hell does that matter now?

25:58.035 --> 26:00.536
It might help us figure out
who took those kids last night.

26:00.538 --> 26:02.805
It wasn't me.

26:02.807 --> 26:06.275
The factory's got cameras.
I work graveyard.

26:06.277 --> 26:07.309
We're not saying you did it.

26:07.311 --> 26:09.978
Well...

26:09.980 --> 26:11.914
You'd be the first.

26:11.916 --> 26:16.251
I mean, everyone in this place
thought I killed Johnny and Allie.

26:16.253 --> 26:18.287
Killed them.

26:18.289 --> 26:21.523
Just 'cause I got in trouble sometimes.

26:21.525 --> 26:25.160
And then, uh...

26:25.162 --> 26:30.232
My folks, they blamed me
for losing them that night.

26:31.502 --> 26:33.669
Never said I hurt 'em.

26:34.738 --> 26:39.374
But it was my fault that they were gone.

26:39.376 --> 26:42.277
You know what that does to a kid?

26:43.347 --> 26:44.913
It does this.

26:48.786 --> 26:52.287
When you rode by us earlier, we
thought maybe you wanted to help.

26:54.291 --> 26:59.862
Let me ask you this... what way
did Allie and Johnny go that night?

27:01.532 --> 27:05.767
They cut through the corn
and past the Ridley farm.

27:05.769 --> 27:07.369
But I found them that
night and Elliott's pond.

27:07.371 --> 27:09.938
And I told Coop that back then.

27:09.940 --> 27:12.341
They dragged it.

27:14.078 --> 27:16.578
They never found them.

27:18.482 --> 27:21.483
Then it froze over that winter.

27:26.190 --> 27:28.290
Thank you.

27:29.293 --> 27:32.828
Appreciate your help.

27:41.939 --> 27:44.273
That was the quietest
car ride we've ever had.

27:44.275 --> 27:46.942
I can't stop thinking
about that guy, you know?

27:46.944 --> 27:48.810
I don't know what I would
have done if I was him.

27:48.812 --> 27:49.878
All that guilt.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.713
How do you deal with that?

27:51.715 --> 27:53.248
He obviously never did.

27:53.250 --> 27:55.784
It's going to be dark soon.
There's a lot of area to cover.

27:55.786 --> 27:57.686
We might want to call in a search party.

27:57.688 --> 28:00.989
Yeah, that's before anybody knew
we had to search the pond again.

28:04.061 --> 28:05.761
Hey.

28:05.763 --> 28:08.363
Look at this.

28:08.365 --> 28:10.899
This can't be good.

28:16.907 --> 28:19.207
Guys, look.

28:19.209 --> 28:21.843
Are we gonna fit through it?

28:25.616 --> 28:27.449
No, there's no way.

28:27.451 --> 28:29.084
Shh.

28:32.289 --> 28:35.557
[Footsteps]

28:35.559 --> 28:38.260
[Door closes]

28:39.096 --> 28:42.130
[Banging]

28:58.649 --> 29:00.115
Aah!

29:05.958 --> 29:07.930
_

29:08.315 --> 29:11.917
Reid: So if you guys want to go
over to the sort of white lake area.

29:11.919 --> 29:14.719
Can I help you?

29:14.721 --> 29:18.290
I don't know. Uh, are you
in any condition to do that?

29:18.292 --> 29:19.524
I switched to coffee.

29:19.526 --> 29:22.294
At this rate, I won't sleep for days.

29:22.296 --> 29:25.997
Ok. We found one of the
boys' bags in a hunting trap,

29:25.999 --> 29:27.032
no other signs of them yet.

29:27.077 --> 29:29.177
Old man Clements used to
have hunting traps out here.

29:29.277 --> 29:30.141
Who's he?

29:30.141 --> 29:32.483
Geezer who got himself
off the grid long time ago.

29:32.483 --> 29:33.633
Survivalist type.

29:33.633 --> 29:36.541
- [Man screaming]
- [Trap snaps]

29:36.543 --> 29:39.110
Aah. Help me.

29:39.112 --> 29:40.612
[Groaning]

29:40.614 --> 29:42.581
Help me. Ohh!

29:42.583 --> 29:43.615
Man: Get a medic!

29:43.617 --> 29:44.983
Son of a bitch!

29:44.985 --> 29:45.651
Aah!

29:46.029 --> 29:47.095
This is fresh bait.

29:47.097 --> 29:48.196
Someone set this recently.

29:48.198 --> 29:49.664
Yeah, look. Somebody tried to fire

29:49.666 --> 29:51.466
some tranquilizer darts and missed.

29:51.468 --> 29:55.570
[Clanking]

30:20.464 --> 30:22.264
This Clements guy used to hunt out here

30:22.266 --> 30:24.065
and someone still using his traps.

30:24.067 --> 30:25.433
I'll patch in Garcia.

30:25.435 --> 30:27.102
[Ring]

30:27.104 --> 30:28.403
I was feeling forgotten.

30:28.405 --> 30:30.772
Never. What do you have on a local man

30:30.774 --> 30:32.274
named Reginald Clements?

30:32.276 --> 30:34.009
Uh, Reginald Clements.

30:34.011 --> 30:37.145
Uh... He's lived there all his life.

30:37.147 --> 30:38.914
He, uh, appears to be,

30:38.916 --> 30:41.449
I think the words for
it are "off his rocker."

30:41.451 --> 30:43.685
Lot of bats in the
belfry. B-a-n-a-n-a-s.

30:43.687 --> 30:46.188
I am going to send you
what I find as I find it

30:46.190 --> 30:47.556
so you can follow along at home.

30:47.558 --> 30:49.491
He's from one of the founding families,

30:49.493 --> 30:52.494
but this Reginald has quite the past.

30:52.496 --> 30:55.463
He did time at that mental
hospital that burned down,

30:55.465 --> 30:57.199
but he was there before the fire.

30:57.201 --> 30:58.600
JJ: For what?

30:58.602 --> 31:00.202
Assault with a deadly weapon.

31:00.281 --> 31:03.582
But it was the bodily harm he
did to himself that put him away.

31:03.607 --> 31:06.241
He claimed he needed
protection from aliens.

31:06.243 --> 31:10.111
His delusions ranged from the
world ending to major conspiracies,

31:10.113 --> 31:12.781
cag him to live entirely off the grid.

31:12.783 --> 31:15.717
And, you know, I'm all for solar
panels and making your own kombucha,

31:15.719 --> 31:18.119
but this guy took it to the extreme.

31:18.121 --> 31:21.423
And when he was 18, he got in trouble

31:21.425 --> 31:23.091
for abduction of a minor.

31:23.093 --> 31:24.259
And get this.

31:24.261 --> 31:25.894
His defense was loneliness.

31:25.896 --> 31:27.195
Reid: When was he released?

31:27.197 --> 31:28.697
Winter of 1982.

31:28.699 --> 31:30.732
So if it was him, he was out for a year

31:30.734 --> 31:33.235
before the Hensons disappeared.

31:33.237 --> 31:35.003
It could have been for a dual purpose...

31:35.005 --> 31:36.705
Survival and companionship.

31:36.707 --> 31:38.640
Is Clements dead, Garcia?

31:38.642 --> 31:40.175
I don't have a death certificate,

31:40.177 --> 31:42.043
but if he's alive, he'd be 82.

31:42.045 --> 31:44.546
Could he have been strong
enough to hold the boys

31:44.548 --> 31:46.381
and set hunting traps?

31:46.383 --> 31:47.382
Doubtful.

31:47.384 --> 31:49.084
What are you thinking, Luke?

31:49.086 --> 31:52.587
I'm thinking the next logical step...

31:52.589 --> 31:54.789
He didn't kill the Hensons.

31:54.791 --> 31:56.691
He's had them this whole time.

31:56.693 --> 31:58.326
How would he maintain control,

31:58.328 --> 32:00.295
especially once they were
strong enough to escape?

32:00.297 --> 32:01.930
He's already got them isolated,

32:01.932 --> 32:03.632
and their home life wasn't great.

32:03.634 --> 32:06.234
He believes that the
world is coming to an end.

32:06.236 --> 32:09.604
He could have convinced
them of his own delusions.

32:09.606 --> 32:11.706
So one paranoid
survivalist bred two more.

32:11.708 --> 32:14.075
And if the Henson twins
have taken our 3 boys,

32:14.077 --> 32:15.977
who knows what they're
gonna do with them.

33:01.692 --> 33:03.792
Go ahead...

33:03.794 --> 33:06.094
Eat.

33:13.203 --> 33:14.703
Don't be afraid.

33:14.705 --> 33:17.706
No one will ever find us here.

33:21.217 --> 33:24.017
[Siren]

33:25.255 --> 33:27.889
Someone with Clements' delusions
would have gone all in.

33:27.891 --> 33:30.292
He could have built a bomb
shelter to hide the Hensons.

33:30.294 --> 33:32.160
And that's where the boys would be now.

33:32.162 --> 33:33.895
Well, we found those tranquilizer darts.

33:33.897 --> 33:36.898
They could have been dosed
and dragged back to the house.

33:36.900 --> 33:39.248
They couldn't be too far
from where P.K.'s bag was.

33:39.248 --> 33:40.780
The boys were looking for adventure.

33:40.782 --> 33:42.449
My gut tells me they'll
keep the unsubs talking

33:42.451 --> 33:43.568
so they can work on a plan to escape.

33:43.568 --> 33:45.368
That isn't what worries me.
We don't know if the Hensons

33:45.370 --> 33:46.969
would want to hurt
them, but if they've been

33:46.971 --> 33:49.072
isolated and tortured this whole time,

33:49.074 --> 33:50.340
who knows what they'll do.

33:53.111 --> 33:54.544
Ah, man, we gotta get out of here.

33:54.546 --> 33:56.779
Do you have a plan?

33:58.483 --> 34:01.951
If we fake sickness and
tell them we need help.

34:01.953 --> 34:04.220
You two can take them.

34:04.222 --> 34:06.656
Get the keys, get the
hell outside and run.

34:06.658 --> 34:08.891
And what? You stay here and get killed?

34:08.893 --> 34:11.828
I stay here until you
guys get back with help.

34:11.830 --> 34:15.630
Well, I mean, unless
you got a better idea.

34:16.801 --> 34:18.467
No backing out.

34:20.472 --> 34:22.538
[Both] No backing out.

34:26.578 --> 34:28.744
Please, you gotta help!

34:28.746 --> 34:31.614
There's something wrong with Josh!

34:31.616 --> 34:34.382
[Door opening]

34:39.991 --> 34:43.659
He gets seizures. If you
don't help him, he'll die.

[Shouts]

34:47.532 --> 34:50.733

34:50.735 --> 34:52.534
Run, Bones!

34:52.536 --> 34:54.504
[Grunting]

35:12.957 --> 35:14.991
No!

35:14.993 --> 35:17.126
Why are you trying to hurt us?

35:17.128 --> 35:19.362
I-I'm not.

35:19.364 --> 35:23.299
I swear, I'm trying to
get help for... for Josh.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.313
Drop the weapon.

35:37.315 --> 35:40.116
Allie.

35:40.118 --> 35:41.951
It's me. Jim Cooper.

35:41.953 --> 35:43.219
You remember?

35:43.221 --> 35:45.488
We need for you to drop the gun.

35:49.460 --> 35:52.828
We need for you to drop the gun.

35:52.830 --> 35:55.031
Go on.

35:55.033 --> 35:57.233
Promise you won't hurt us.

35:57.235 --> 35:59.835
Oh, I promise.

35:59.837 --> 36:01.103
I promise.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.719
It's ok.

36:16.721 --> 36:19.789
It's ok. All right? Ok.

36:24.329 --> 36:26.362
It's all right.

36:37.041 --> 36:40.109
Hey. You guys ok?

36:40.111 --> 36:41.344
- You guys ok?
- Yeah.

36:41.346 --> 36:42.812
Let's go. Let's get you out of here.

36:42.814 --> 36:44.947
Let's go. Come on.

36:46.317 --> 36:47.950
Watch it.

36:52.390 --> 36:55.324
[Music, no audible dialogue]

38:57.448 --> 39:01.417
[Gasping, crying]

39:01.419 --> 39:04.120
[Sobbing]

39:06.624 --> 39:09.258
[Allie sobbing]

39:19.437 --> 39:21.404
You ok?

39:21.406 --> 39:24.540
Yeah. I'm just glad we found those kids.

39:24.542 --> 39:26.942
Oh, yeah, me, too.

39:26.944 --> 39:29.745
But, uh, I was talking
about that other thing.

39:29.747 --> 39:32.782
I haven't had a chance to talk
to you guys. What do you think?

39:32.784 --> 39:34.817
I think we've been
through a lot of changes

39:34.819 --> 39:37.686
and we always figure it out, you know?

39:37.688 --> 39:40.489
Morgan left, and now Hotch,

39:40.491 --> 39:43.659
but if you stay, it'll be ok.

39:45.196 --> 39:48.197
Well, I talked to Mark.

39:48.199 --> 39:49.331
And?

39:49.333 --> 39:51.801
He's gonna be here
next week for a visit.

39:51.803 --> 39:55.171
Well, that's a good start.

39:55.173 --> 39:58.207
But they need an answer
in the morning, right?

39:58.209 --> 39:59.708
I know.

39:59.710 --> 40:01.844
Here's the truth. If you
don't take the position,

40:01.846 --> 40:03.312
they're gonna bring in some stranger

40:03.314 --> 40:04.447
to be the Unit chief.

40:04.449 --> 40:05.815
And I don't know how that'll turn out,

40:05.817 --> 40:08.451
but the learning curve could be brutal.

40:08.453 --> 40:11.620
It'll probably stink for us, but...

40:11.622 --> 40:14.790
Look, we're your friends
and we'll support you

40:14.792 --> 40:18.160
no matter what you decide.

40:20.064 --> 40:21.330
I'm gonna stay.

40:21.332 --> 40:23.499
Oh, thank God!

40:23.501 --> 40:24.533
Are you serious?

40:24.535 --> 40:25.534
Yes.

40:25.536 --> 40:27.236
I love being here,

40:27.238 --> 40:28.671
and I've really missed you guys.

40:28.673 --> 40:30.906
We have missed you, too.

40:30.908 --> 40:33.542
Honestly, you have no idea how much.

40:33.544 --> 40:35.578
[Laughs]

40:37.048 --> 40:38.848
[Indistinct chatter]

40:38.850 --> 40:40.516
We need to talk.

40:47.124 --> 40:49.024
Surprise!

40:49.026 --> 40:51.060
Ha ha! News travels fast.

40:51.062 --> 40:53.362
Oh, good news does.
I'm so happy you're here.

40:53.364 --> 40:54.363
We all are.

40:54.365 --> 40:56.398
And I've got some big shoes to fill.

40:56.400 --> 40:59.235
Well, I'm not worried. Besides,
you'd never let us all down.

40:59.237 --> 41:01.504
[Laughs] Oh, great. No pressure.

41:01.506 --> 41:04.306
Well, let me just say
something to everyone.

41:04.308 --> 41:07.042
I, um...

41:07.044 --> 41:12.915
I've been in and out of here since 1978,

41:12.917 --> 41:16.018
but I know this is where I belong.

41:16.020 --> 41:21.090
I've seen a lot of great
agents pass through those doors,

41:21.092 --> 41:23.859
and a lot of them have moved on.

41:23.861 --> 41:28.063
Now, most of this team has been together

41:28.065 --> 41:30.966
for over a decade.

41:30.968 --> 41:35.304
But I promise you, that
doesn't happen often.

41:35.306 --> 41:38.307
Now, I've heard the rumblings
about how lucky we are,

41:38.309 --> 41:40.543
and it's true, but the truth is,

41:40.545 --> 41:44.713
it's what happens...

41:44.715 --> 41:47.082
When we're not on a case

41:47.084 --> 41:50.920
that has defined who we are.

41:50.922 --> 41:53.689
We stand beside one another,

41:53.691 --> 41:56.992
through good, through bad,

41:56.994 --> 41:59.361
because we're family.

41:59.363 --> 42:02.097
So...

42:02.099 --> 42:04.900
To Aaron and Jack,

42:04.902 --> 42:08.203
I don't know who's luckier,
but it warms my heart

42:08.205 --> 42:11.173
to know that they'll be together

42:11.175 --> 42:13.676
every day and safe.

42:13.678 --> 42:15.277
Hear, hear.

42:15.279 --> 42:17.513
And to Emily,

42:17.515 --> 42:21.216
our friend and new Unit Chief.

42:21.218 --> 42:22.918
Welcome home.

42:22.920 --> 42:24.453
Cheers! Cheers!

42:24.455 --> 42:25.487
Cheers! Cheers!

42:25.489 --> 42:27.022
Whoo!

42:27.024 --> 42:29.792
[Indistinct chatter and laughter]

42:33.831 --> 42:36.765
Garcia: "So long as the memory
of certain beloved friends"

42:36.767 --> 42:38.167
"lives in my heart,

42:38.169 --> 42:40.536
I shall say that life is good."

42:40.538 --> 42:41.971
Helen Keller.
