01:05.857 --> 01:08.526
Referee, why don't you stop the fight?

01:15.861 --> 01:17.785
Let's go! Let's go!

01:21.455 --> 01:24.750
Come on! Get him!

01:26.210 --> 01:28.421
Come on! Hit him! Hit him!

01:51.903 --> 01:54.906
You're waltzing.
Give the sucker some action.

01:55.489 --> 01:58.409
You're fighting like a bum.
Want some advice?

01:58.492 --> 01:59.577
Water.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.579
Cold beer here!

02:03.414 --> 02:06.250
Should I bet the fight don't go
three rounds? You feel strong?

02:06.334 --> 02:08.752
- Absolutely.
- Cold beer!

02:08.836 --> 02:11.756
- You want some good advice?
- Mouthpiece.

02:22.975 --> 02:24.519
Come on, Rock!

03:33.462 --> 03:35.631
All right. All right.

03:36.048 --> 03:40.636
Next a six-rounder
between local lightweights Kid Brooks

03:40.803 --> 03:42.513
and Sugar Johnson.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.398
Good going, champ.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.818
- Hey.
- Say what?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.988
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah, you can have this one.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.407
You're a bum.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.660
You're a bum, you know that?
You're a bum!

04:33.439 --> 04:35.566
You really got lucky tonight.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.193
Spider, here's loser's share.

04:37.276 --> 04:39.862
$40, less $15 locker and cornerman,

04:39.946 --> 04:42.782
$5 shower and towel, 7 percent tax.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.867
Comes to 17.20.

04:44.951 --> 04:47.370
You fought a good fight, Spider.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.747
Balboa, you get winner's share, $65.

04:49.830 --> 04:54.710
Less $15 locker and cornerman,
$5 shower and towel and 7 percent tax.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.255
Comes to 40.55.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.008
- When do I fight again?
- Maybe two weeks.

05:01.217 --> 05:04.971
Give me a call. The doctor should be in
in about 20 minutes.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.925
Hey, boy.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.234
You guys are getting better every year.
You know that?

06:41.859 --> 06:42.985
Yeah.

07:55.057 --> 07:58.060
Hey, your old man did pretty good tonight.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.979
Why weren't you there?

08:00.062 --> 08:02.773
You should've seen me. You guys hungry?

08:05.234 --> 08:06.694
Here you go.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.280
Here you go.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.577
You wanna see
your friend Moby Dick, huh?

08:17.872 --> 08:20.791
How you doing, Moby Dick?
You miss me today?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.088
Here you go. Say hi.

08:26.172 --> 08:29.842
If you guys could sing or dance,
I wouldn't be doing this.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.029
And this turtle food I got here, it's...

08:51.405 --> 08:53.407
This turtle food I got here
has more flies in it...

08:53.491 --> 08:55.368
There are more moths in it than flies.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.621
More flies... More moths...
Who the hell cares?

10:19.410 --> 10:22.079
How you feeling this morning? Full of life?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.539
Fine.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.541
How you doing, killer?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.586
- How's the turtle food this week?
- Fine.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.339
I'm kind of aggravated.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.632
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.343
Ain't your fault.
You don't wanna hear about it?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.220
I'll tell you somebody
who don't wanna hear about it.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.263
- How you doing, Gloria?
- Good.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.518
The last turtle food I got here
had more moths in it than flies, Adrian.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.394
These moths get caught
in the turtle's throat

10:45.478 --> 10:48.439
and they cough, and I gotta smack them
on the back of the shell

10:48.523 --> 10:50.399
and what do you think they get?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.026
They get what?

10:54.278 --> 10:56.364
Come on. Shell shock.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.407
They get shell-shocked.
What do you think?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.576
You're starting with
the bad jokes early, huh?

11:00.660 --> 11:03.204
Well, no.
Inventing jokes ain't so easy sometimes.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.164
No, that wasn't no joke.

11:05.248 --> 11:08.376
Hey, how's my buddy doing today?
Yo, Butkus.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.086
Yo, Butkus!

11:11.170 --> 11:12.547
What is it?

11:16.259 --> 11:18.719
Hey, give me a kiss.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.890
Adrian, go downstairs and clean
all the cat cages. They're a mess.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.032
You gotta pay for that turtle food,
rock head.

11:40.449 --> 11:43.369
Hey, crime don't pay.
You know that, Gloria.

12:07.935 --> 12:10.313
- Yo, Rock, how's your boss?
- Real good.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.356
Hey, Rock, you fighting again?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.400
- Here and there.
- We'll make some money real soon, huh?

12:14.483 --> 12:16.444
Yeah, a million dollars.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.280
Hey, you. Where are you going?

12:24.619 --> 12:27.371
Where are you going? Where you running?

12:27.914 --> 12:29.957
- Where you running?
- Hey! Hey!

12:30.041 --> 12:32.627
- Hey! Don't hit the face!
- Shut up!

12:32.710 --> 12:35.004
- Not the face!
- Mr. Gazzo wants the 200 now.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.297
I'm broke!

12:36.380 --> 12:39.550
Mr. Gazzo says I should get the 200
or break your thumb. You understand?

12:39.634 --> 12:42.470
- Please, don't...
- What's your name again?

12:43.304 --> 12:46.307
- Bob!
- Bob. Listen, Bob.

12:47.350 --> 12:50.019
You wanna dance, you gotta pay the band.
You understand?

12:50.102 --> 12:52.355
You wanna borrow,
you gotta pay the man.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.816
Hey, I ain't emotionally involved, Bob.
You understand?

12:55.900 --> 12:58.528
Give me some money.
Give me some money.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.742
There's 130 here.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.786
That's it. I'm broke.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.289
Hey, Bob, you're still $70 light.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.709
You don't have to break nothing.
Take my coat.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.837
It's worth $50, $60.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.964
Take the coat!

13:19.549 --> 13:21.050
You know, you should've planned ahead.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.261
You know that?
You should've planned ahead.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.680
We'll fake it. I'll tape up the hand
like you broke the thumb!

13:25.763 --> 13:28.349
- Should've planned ahead.
- Gazzo don't have to know!

13:28.432 --> 13:31.477
He won't be wise to nothing!
Gazzo won't be wise to nothing!

13:31.561 --> 13:34.355
Keep the coat! Keep the...

14:03.384 --> 14:07.513
He only had 130, but I think he's good
for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.891
Sure, Rocky. Bob's good for it.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.935
That's it for today.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.315
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio.
He's late three weeks. I don't like it.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.734
Tomorrow, three weeks. Del Rio?

14:20.151 --> 14:22.361
All right, I got it.
How do you spell Del Rio?

14:22.445 --> 14:24.739
- How'd you do last night?
- I did real good.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.240
- Hey.
- What?

14:26.741 --> 14:29.160
- Did you get the license number?
- Of what?

14:29.243 --> 14:31.078
The truck that run over your face.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.247
Relax, Buddy. Pull it over here.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.792
I wanna let Rocky out.
I'm gonna talk to him for a few seconds.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.526
Why didn't you break this guy's thumb?

15:01.609 --> 15:03.903
- How do you know I didn't?
- You don't think I hear things?

15:03.986 --> 15:05.780
Didn't I give you a job this morning?

15:05.863 --> 15:08.741
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you break his thumb?

15:08.824 --> 15:12.662
When you don't do what I tell you to do,
you make me look bad.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.790
I figured... Look.
I figured if I break the guy's thumb,

15:15.873 --> 15:17.208
he gets laid off.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.169
- He can't make money.
- Let me do the figuring.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.630
From here on in, let me do the figuring.

15:22.713 --> 15:26.759
These guys think we're running a charity,
they'll get off light.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.345
From here on in, do what I tell you to do,

15:29.428 --> 15:30.930
because it's bad for my reputation.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.766
You understand? You got it, Rock?

15:34.809 --> 15:36.102
I got it.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.982
How do you spell Del Rio?

15:41.315 --> 15:43.818
- Look it up in a dictionary.
- Come on!

15:43.901 --> 15:47.071
I won't let that happen no more,
about the thumb.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.241
You know?

15:51.367 --> 15:53.077
So long, meat bag.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.166
I should've broke your thumbs!

16:27.862 --> 16:29.989
Hey, Rock. Heard you did good last night.

16:30.072 --> 16:33.117
- Absolutely. Should've seen me.
- Shouldn't you take a rest?

16:33.201 --> 16:35.077
- No, my back is hurt.
- Your back?

16:35.161 --> 16:37.246
My back is hurt. You deaf?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.873
No, I'm short.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.022
Hey, yo, Mike.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.067
Where's my lock?
Whose stuff is this in my locker?

17:48.150 --> 17:51.362
It's Dipper's stuff.
It ain't your locker no more.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.617
What you talking about?
It's been my locker for six years.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.077
Where's my gear?

17:58.161 --> 18:00.788
Mickey told me to bag it and hang it.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.628
You put my stuff on skid row.

18:07.712 --> 18:11.799
I been in that locker for six years,
and you put my stuff on skid row?

18:11.883 --> 18:14.302
Mickey tells me what to do, I gotta do it.

18:14.385 --> 18:15.803
Where is he?

18:15.887 --> 18:18.306
He's outside working with Dipper.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.766
- He's in a bad mood.
- So am I.

18:31.152 --> 18:32.653
Keep your hands up.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.489
Keep your hands up. Watch the right.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.241
- Hey, Mick.
- Shut up!

18:37.325 --> 18:39.494
To the body. Attaboy.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.624
Time. Time!

18:46.584 --> 18:48.252
What do you want?

18:48.503 --> 18:50.671
- How you feeling today?
- What?

18:50.755 --> 18:52.840
- How you feeling?
- Are you a doctor?

18:52.924 --> 18:55.885
- You have problems today?
- Never mind. What's your problem?

18:55.968 --> 18:59.972
I been talking to Michael.
How come I been put out of my locker?

19:00.056 --> 19:03.434
Because Dipper needed it.
Dipper's a contender.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.728
He's a climber.
Do you know what you are?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.105
- You're a tomato.
- Tomato?

19:08.189 --> 19:11.359
I run a business here,
not a goddamn soup kitchen.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.402
- Did you fight last night?
- Yeah.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.489
- Did you win?
- Yeah, I won K.O. In the second.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.282
Yeah? Who'd you fight?

19:18.366 --> 19:19.784
Spider Rico.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.536
He's a bum!

19:22.245 --> 19:25.706
- You think everybody I fight is a bum.
- Well, ain't they?

19:25.790 --> 19:28.918
You got heart,
but you fight like a goddamn ape.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.213
The only thing special about you,
you never got your nose busted.

19:32.296 --> 19:36.008
Leave it that way. Nice and pretty
and what's left of your mind.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.803
I think I'm gonna go take a steam.
You know why?

19:38.886 --> 19:41.556
Because I did good last night,
and you should've seen me.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.183
- Big deal.
- You should've seen me too.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.560
Hey, kid.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.479
- You ever think about retiring?
- No.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.231
- You think about it.
- Yeah.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.899
All right, time.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.568
- Time!
- What?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.778
I dig your locker, man.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.241
Dig your locker.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.744
Attaboy.

20:34.442 --> 20:35.860
Cold night.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.864
Whew! Good night to catch pneumonia,
you know?

20:43.618 --> 20:45.620
You need some help?

20:46.454 --> 20:49.373
There's a good game
at the Spectrum tonight.

20:51.876 --> 20:54.337
You wanna go to a basketball game?

20:57.465 --> 20:59.258
Hi, Butkus. Hi, kid.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.805
Tough day today.
They took my locker away.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.683
I had that locker for six years.
It don't bother me.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.310
Lockers are bad, anyway, after a while.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.645
People get the combination.

21:10.728 --> 21:14.607
I must've had 20 bucks
taken out of there in the past 6 years.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.735
Don't sound like much, but it adds up.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.862
Doesn't matter. Who cares?

21:21.781 --> 21:24.075
Yeah, cold night. Hey, birds.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.828
Hey, look who's here. Look who's here.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.454
The giant worm.

21:29.664 --> 21:33.876
Look at these birds.
Don't these birds look like flying candy?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.795
Bird, you wanna fly me home?

21:35.878 --> 21:38.381
You need somebody to walk you home?

21:38.631 --> 21:39.799
- No.
- No?

21:40.550 --> 21:44.428
It's a cold night.
If you got the money, take a cab.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.639
Too many creeps around here.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.809
Every other block, there's a creep.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.311
You can always tell a creep.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.190
Listen. I'm gonna go now, okay?

21:56.274 --> 21:57.984
I'll see you later, all right?

21:58.067 --> 22:01.863
None of you guys get up.
I know you had a hard day in the cage.

22:01.946 --> 22:03.155
So,

22:03.406 --> 22:06.159
I'm gonna go home, make up a joke.
I'll tell you a new joke tomorrow.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.994
Okay? Good night, Adrian.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.787
Good night, Rocky.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.892
Don't know what happened.

22:32.143 --> 22:35.062
Hey, there, Lefty. Got a friend for you here.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.356
- Hello, Rock.
- How you doing?

22:37.440 --> 22:39.650
- You seen Paulie?
- Yeah, he's in the steam room.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.570
- Yeah.
- Hey, Rocky. What's with the eye?

22:42.653 --> 22:44.614
- Been fighting.
- Hope you won it, at least.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.532
Oh, yeah, did real good.
You should've seen me.

22:46.616 --> 22:49.577
<i>... heavyweight champion of the world</i>
<i>Apollo Creed at Kennedy Airport...</i>

22:49.660 --> 22:51.787
Hey, Rock, who'd you fight?

22:51.871 --> 22:53.289
Spider Rico.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.625
Jesus. Is he still around?

22:55.708 --> 22:58.878
Yeah, he's doing real good.
He's doing better than you are.

22:58.961 --> 23:02.590
Hey, Paulie. What, do you lock the door?
Yo, Paulie.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.718
I'd like to kill the freaking moron
who broke the mirror.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.428
Hey, yo, Paulie.

23:08.137 --> 23:12.558
Every day, every night, I pass by.
Your sister's giving me the shoulder.

23:12.642 --> 23:14.310
- Forget her.
- What do you mean?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.395
- You can do better than her.
- I don't forget nothing.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.523
Every night I pass by, I tell a joke.

23:18.606 --> 23:21.234
Every morning I pass by, I tell a joke.

23:21.317 --> 23:23.402
She just looks at me,
you know what I mean?

23:23.486 --> 23:26.405
- Looks?
- Yeah, like I'm a plate of leftovers.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.241
I need a Cadillac
to connect with your sister?

23:28.324 --> 23:30.576
Something wrong with my face?

23:31.327 --> 23:33.246
She's a freaking loser.

23:33.329 --> 23:36.582
Sometimes she gets me so crazy,
I could split her head with a razor.

23:36.666 --> 23:39.585
- Don't get mental.
- You caught me in a bad mood.

23:39.669 --> 23:42.505
- You're always in a bad mood.
- Adrian ain't sharp.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.465
Adrian is a loser.

23:44.549 --> 23:46.926
She's pushing 30 freaking years old.

23:47.009 --> 23:49.345
If she don't watch out,
she's gonna die alone.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.056
- I'm 30 myself.
- And you'll die alone.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.100
I don't see no crowd around you neither.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.435
I'd like to kill the freaking moron
who broke the mirror.

23:56.519 --> 23:59.146
Come on. Let's get out of this stink.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.900
- I wanna talk to you anyway.
- About what?

24:02.984 --> 24:05.403
- You still work for Gazzo?
- Yeah, sure.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.989
Why don't you talk to him about me?

24:08.239 --> 24:11.200
I just don't think Gazzo's hiring right now.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.828
You know? Come on.

24:17.999 --> 24:20.168
- The girl's drying up.
- Who?

24:20.251 --> 24:23.838
My sister. If she don't start living,
her body's gonna dry up.

24:23.921 --> 24:26.299
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving, you know that?

24:26.382 --> 24:29.260
- Come over and talk to her.
- Sure. Beer.

24:29.677 --> 24:31.637
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?

24:31.721 --> 24:33.973
Absolutely. You got it.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.435
I gotta go. If I'm ten minutes late,
she calls the hospital.

24:37.518 --> 24:38.811
- Paulie!
- I got it.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.521
<i>... Bicentennial fight with Mac Lee Green</i>

24:40.605 --> 24:43.482
<i>here in Philadelphia</i>
<i>at the fabulous Spectrum.</i>

24:43.566 --> 24:44.734
<i>Larry.</i>

24:44.817 --> 24:47.278
<i>You're speaking now of your</i>
<i>much-publicized Bicentennial fight.</i>

24:47.361 --> 24:50.573
<i>Right. This is gonna be the greatest</i>
<i>sporting event in the country's history.</i>

24:50.656 --> 24:53.784
<i>A gala occurrence with me beating Green</i>
<i>like he committed a crime.</i>

24:53.868 --> 24:56.454
Would you take a look at that guy?

24:56.537 --> 24:59.707
I mean, where are the real fighters
gonna come from? The pros.

24:59.790 --> 25:02.168
All we got today are jig clowns.

25:02.251 --> 25:04.629
<i>... on January 1st.</i>
<i>The first major event in the country's...</i>

25:04.712 --> 25:06.839
- Clown?
- That's right, clown.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.384
<i>And in keeping with great events</i>
<i>throughout the country's history,</i>

25:10.468 --> 25:14.472
<i>Apollo Creed will duplicate the cracking</i>
<i>of the Liberty Bell by cracking Green.</i>

25:14.555 --> 25:17.058
You're calling Apollo Creed a clown?

25:17.141 --> 25:19.060
What else? Look at him.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.521
<i>Stay in school and use your brain.</i>

25:21.604 --> 25:24.565
<i>Be a doctor, be a lawyer,</i>
<i>carry a leather briefcase.</i>

25:24.649 --> 25:28.152
<i>Forget about sports as a profession.</i>
<i>Sports make you grunt and smell.</i>

25:28.236 --> 25:31.864
<i>- Be a thinker, not a stinker.</i>
<i>- Thanks a lot, champ.</i>

25:31.948 --> 25:34.158
You crazy?
This man is champion of the world.

25:34.242 --> 25:36.911
He took his best shot and become champ.

25:37.578 --> 25:39.580
What shot did you ever take?

25:39.664 --> 25:42.875
Hey, Rocky,
you're not happy with your life, that's nice.

25:42.959 --> 25:46.254
But me, I got a business going.
I don't have to take no shots.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.339
<i>... no one having gone</i>
<i>more than 12 rounds with him...</i>

25:48.422 --> 25:51.133
- That's right.
<i>...and that was Jake Dale last June...</i>

25:51.217 --> 25:54.929
- Stick that up your business.
- Why you getting so insulted?

25:55.471 --> 25:58.099
You want me to take a shot? All right.

25:58.307 --> 25:59.892
I'll take a shot.

26:13.531 --> 26:16.033
- Hey, Rocky, how about a bottle?
- No wine, man.

26:16.117 --> 26:19.328
- Come on. Just a little.
- Buy us some Thunderbird.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.957
Marie, does your brother know
you're hanging out so late?

26:23.040 --> 26:25.209
- Get lost, creep.
- Screw you, yo-yo!

26:25.293 --> 26:27.336
These guys teach you to talk like that?

26:27.420 --> 26:30.256
- Stuff it!
- Don't you never say that to me.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.509
You stink up the neighborhood!

26:35.094 --> 26:36.929
You know, you can...

26:37.054 --> 26:41.309
When I was your age, only one girl in
the whole neighborhood talked like that.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.269
That was it. Just one.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.564
What are you doing?
It'll make your teeth yellow. Don't do that.

26:46.647 --> 26:47.940
I like yellow teeth!

26:48.024 --> 26:50.401
- It'll make your breath like garbage.
- Maybe I like garbage.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.278
Nobody likes garbage.

26:52.695 --> 26:55.198
Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth
wasn't bad looking,

26:55.281 --> 26:57.783
but none of the guys ever took her serious.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.702
They never took her out
for any serious date.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.329
- Why?
- 'Cause that's the way guys are.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.456
They laugh when you talk dirty.
They think you're cute.

27:03.539 --> 27:06.209
After a while, you get a reputation.
You get no respect.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.628
You understand? You get no respect.

27:08.711 --> 27:11.422
I gotta use a bad word, whore.

27:11.506 --> 27:13.424
You understand? Whore.

27:13.508 --> 27:17.470
See? You use dirty words,
and maybe you end up becoming a whore.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.472
Come on, Rocky. I'm 12.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.933
That don't matter.

27:22.016 --> 27:25.102
You don't really have to be one.
Just act like one and that's it.

27:25.186 --> 27:28.856
Boom! Bing! You get a bad rep.
You understand?

27:29.190 --> 27:32.485
Twenty years from now,
people are gonna say,

27:32.568 --> 27:34.904
"Do you remember Marie?"
"No. Who was she?"

27:34.987 --> 27:37.573
"She was the little whore who hung down
at the Atomic Hoagie Shop."

27:37.657 --> 27:39.951
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember her."

27:40.034 --> 27:43.538
You see, they don't remember you.
They remember the rep.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.164
You understand?

27:46.165 --> 27:49.460
You got a boyfriend?
No, you ain't got a boyfriend.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.588
You know why?
Why don't you think you have a boyfriend?

27:52.672 --> 27:55.466
'Cause you're hanging out with them
coconuts on the corner.

27:55.550 --> 27:57.343
You hang around coconuts,
you get nowhere.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.178
They're lemons. Lemons.

27:59.262 --> 28:02.306
You hang out with nice people,
you get nice friends. You understand?

28:02.390 --> 28:04.851
You hang out with smart people,
you get smart friends.

28:04.934 --> 28:07.478
You hang out with yo-yo people,
you get yo-yo friends.

28:07.562 --> 28:09.981
You see, it's simple mathematics.

28:10.815 --> 28:12.316
- I hope you ain't...
- I won't.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.484
What was I gonna say?

28:13.568 --> 28:16.612
You hope I don't keep acting
like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?

28:16.696 --> 28:17.780
Yeah, something like that.

28:17.864 --> 28:18.990
Good night, Rocky.

28:19.073 --> 28:21.367
- Good night. Take care.
- Hey, Rocky.

28:21.450 --> 28:24.078
- Yo.
- Screw you, creep-o!

28:32.003 --> 28:34.797
Yeah, who are you to give advice, creep-o?

28:34.881 --> 28:36.299
Who are you?

28:55.151 --> 28:58.362
- Are the doctor's reports confirmed?
- Definitely.

28:58.613 --> 29:00.490
Says here Mac Lee Green has suffered

29:00.573 --> 29:04.076
"a severely cracked third metacarpal
in his left hand."

29:04.577 --> 29:05.912
Damn!

29:06.078 --> 29:10.082
We can cancel the fight indefinitely
if you're set on fighting Green.

29:10.166 --> 29:12.210
Hey, it ain't just Green.

29:12.502 --> 29:14.837
What about all the time
Apollo has invested?

29:14.921 --> 29:16.589
We can find a solution.

29:16.672 --> 29:17.757
Solution nothing.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.551
Find me another ranked contender
in a flash, Jergens.

29:20.635 --> 29:22.595
Don't play games with my client.

29:22.678 --> 29:25.264
Apollo's already done a million dollars'
worth of publicity,

29:25.348 --> 29:28.267
has made contractual obligations
with 20 different organizations.

29:28.351 --> 29:30.061
He's not going to be embarrassed!

29:30.144 --> 29:32.522
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.565
Ernie's fighting in France that same week.

29:34.649 --> 29:36.776
Then get me Buddy Shaw.
He's ranked fifth.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.695
Went to California and gained 50 pounds.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.156
I called every worthwhile contender.

29:42.240 --> 29:46.202
They all say five weeks isn't enough time
to get into shape.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.788
Shape nothing, man. They're afraid.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.915
They know everybody
is gonna see this fight.

29:50.998 --> 29:52.792
None of them's got
a prayer of whipping me.

29:52.875 --> 29:56.921
They're making excuses so they don't
have to be the chump who gets whipped.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.632
All I can say is I'm a good promoter.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.302
I've promoted fights
in every goddamn country in the world

30:03.386 --> 30:05.555
and I've broken my ass over this one.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.849
I don't know what else to do!

30:13.437 --> 30:14.605
I do.

30:16.941 --> 30:20.903
Without a ranked contender,
what this fight needs is a novelty.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.781
This is the land of opportunity, right?

30:23.865 --> 30:26.284
So, Apollo Creed, on January 1st,

30:26.367 --> 30:29.453
gives a local underdog fighter
an opportunity.

30:30.163 --> 30:34.500
A snow-white underdog, and I'm gonna
put his face on this poster with me.

30:34.584 --> 30:36.460
And I'll tell you why.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.546
Because I'm sentimental.

30:38.880 --> 30:41.632
A lot of other people in this country
are just as sentimental

30:41.716 --> 30:44.510
and there's nothing they'd like better
than to see Apollo Creed

30:44.594 --> 30:47.722
give a local Philadelphia boy
a shot at the greatest title in the world

30:47.805 --> 30:50.141
on this country's biggest birthday.

30:50.224 --> 30:52.310
Now that's the way I see it

30:52.643 --> 30:54.896
and that's the way it's gonna be.

30:54.979 --> 30:56.647
Apollo, I like it.

30:57.148 --> 30:58.900
It's very American.

30:59.609 --> 31:02.612
No, Jergens. It's very smart.

31:27.178 --> 31:29.347
- What is it?
- I wanna check this thing out.

31:29.430 --> 31:33.184
You said pick up two yards from Snyder
and a grand from Cappoli, right?

31:33.267 --> 31:37.355
No, no. Two yards from Cappoli
and a grand from Snyder.

31:37.438 --> 31:39.190
- Two yards.
- Write it down, okay?

31:39.273 --> 31:40.858
Yeah, I got it.

31:40.942 --> 31:44.362
Who's this girl you're going out with
tomorrow night?

31:44.529 --> 31:46.697
- How'd you know?
- I know.

31:46.781 --> 31:49.909
Don't you think I hear things?
Lot of canaries flying around the docks.

31:49.992 --> 31:52.203
- I'm going out with Paulie's sister.
- Hey, Rocky.

31:52.286 --> 31:54.497
- What?
- I hear she's retarded.

31:54.705 --> 31:56.749
She ain't retarded. She's shy, you know?

31:56.833 --> 32:01.379
Tell you what to do. Take her to the zoo.
I hear retards like the zoo.

32:01.462 --> 32:03.339
- This bum gotta say that?
- Who you calling a bum?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.216
- Back it up, Buddy.
- I'm calling you a bum!

32:05.299 --> 32:08.594
Relax, relax. Buddy's in a bad mood.
It's his prostate.

32:08.678 --> 32:11.764
He's always in a bad mood.
You ought to count your blessings.

32:11.848 --> 32:13.516
You're still a healthy person.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.810
- I don't like your face.
- I don't like yours either!

32:15.893 --> 32:17.937
- Kiss my ass!
- Come out here!

32:18.020 --> 32:20.565
Relax! Relax. My ears.

32:20.648 --> 32:23.276
Are you driving me crazy? Both of you.

32:23.484 --> 32:26.070
Look. Buddy doesn't like you.

32:26.571 --> 32:29.407
Some guys, they just hate for no reason.
<i>Capisce?</i>

32:29.490 --> 32:31.159
- Yeah.
- Come here.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.997
Here's 50 bucks. You and your girl Adrian,
you have a nice time.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.290
Thanks.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.543
How'd you know her name?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.879
You don't think I hear things?

32:43.588 --> 32:44.964
- Hey, Rock.
- What?

32:45.047 --> 32:46.382
- Remember what I told you?
- What'd you tell me?

32:46.465 --> 32:47.592
Take her to the zoo.

32:47.675 --> 32:49.594
Come on out of the car!

32:56.100 --> 32:59.395
- Some more coffee, Mr. Creed?
- No, thanks, Shirley.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.856
What do you think about Billy Snow?

33:01.939 --> 33:03.107
Fouls.

33:04.609 --> 33:06.485
How about Big Chuck Smith?

33:06.569 --> 33:08.613
No, he's too old and dull.

33:08.779 --> 33:10.698
Hey, that Bobby Judge, he's a good boy.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.492
No. I don't feel no heat from that name.

33:12.575 --> 33:14.702
Joe Zack's a good prospect.

33:15.953 --> 33:18.789
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?

33:19.874 --> 33:22.126
This is what I'm looking for.

33:22.293 --> 33:24.378
The Italian Stallion.

33:24.795 --> 33:27.215
Rocky Balboa? Never heard of him.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.717
Look, it's the name, man.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.802
The Italian Stallion.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.388
The media will eat it up.

33:34.472 --> 33:37.308
Who discovered America?
An Italian, right?

33:37.642 --> 33:41.145
What would be better than to get it on
with one of his descendants?

33:41.229 --> 33:42.688
He's a southpaw.

33:42.772 --> 33:44.482
I don't want you messing around
with southpaws.

33:44.565 --> 33:46.651
- They do everything backwards.
- Southpaw nothing.

33:46.734 --> 33:48.653
I'll drop him in three.

33:49.737 --> 33:53.491
Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.370
Sounds like a damn monster movie.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.747
What are you doing with that bat?

33:59.831 --> 34:01.499
I used to be deadly at stickball.

34:01.582 --> 34:04.418
- Your sister knows I'm coming?
- She's very excited.

34:04.794 --> 34:06.879
- Look at these swollen hands.
- Yeah.

34:06.963 --> 34:10.382
The joints from carrying meat
in and out of the freezer.

34:10.466 --> 34:13.678
- Plays hell on the joints.
- Maybe you ought to see a doctor.

34:13.761 --> 34:15.679
I don't need a doctor.
I need a different job.

34:15.763 --> 34:18.181
Different job. What kind of turkey?
Big? Small?

34:18.266 --> 34:21.643
Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a good man.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.772
Nothing bothers me.
I'd make a great collector.

34:24.856 --> 34:26.858
Busting bones don't bother me.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.318
Don't bother you. Big turkey, right?

34:29.402 --> 34:32.405
Gazzo's gotta give me... Forget Gazzo.
It's a bad job.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.031
You got a match?

34:34.114 --> 34:36.033
Go to him for me. As a favor.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.870
Yeah, yeah. Last time I had a turkey

34:38.953 --> 34:42.456
was when they had a two-dollar special
at Horn and Hardart's three years ago.

34:42.540 --> 34:45.042
Last year, me and the turtles had Spam.

34:53.301 --> 34:57.221
- Your sister knows I'm coming?
- Yeah, yeah. She's very excited.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.977
Will you forget about Gazzo?

35:03.644 --> 35:05.146
I don't ask nobody twice.

35:05.229 --> 35:07.148
Don't ask nobody twice.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.614
You're sure your sister knows I'm coming?

35:14.697 --> 35:16.741
Yeah. She's very excited.

35:20.411 --> 35:22.163
Paulie, you're late.

35:23.206 --> 35:24.499
You call the hospital?

35:24.582 --> 35:27.668
She calls the hospital
if I'm ten minutes late.

35:28.586 --> 35:30.296
Yo, how you doing?

35:31.380 --> 35:33.758
I told you, she's very excited.

35:36.344 --> 35:38.679
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him here?

35:38.763 --> 35:40.348
I'm not ready for this.

35:40.431 --> 35:42.850
Would it make a difference if you were?

35:42.934 --> 35:45.394
- He's taking you out.
- No, I can't.

35:46.687 --> 35:49.440
I want you out of the kitchen right now.

35:50.107 --> 35:51.359
I won't.

35:56.239 --> 35:58.783
I want you out of here instamatically!

35:58.866 --> 36:01.494
I'm sick of seeing you
hanging around like a freaking spider.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.746
Go out and live. Enjoy life!

36:03.955 --> 36:05.581
I can't go!

36:05.665 --> 36:07.583
Don't get wise with me now.

36:07.667 --> 36:09.377
I'm tired of you being a loser.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.629
Don't call me that, Paulie!

36:11.712 --> 36:14.632
<i>Apollo Creed says he'll be shopping</i>
<i>for another victim</i>

36:14.715 --> 36:18.469
<i>to fill Green's vacancy</i>
<i>for the Bicentennial championship fight...</i>

36:18.553 --> 36:20.263
Why didn't you tell me
you were bringing him home?

36:20.346 --> 36:21.639
How do you know I didn't?

36:21.722 --> 36:24.559
I can't go, Paulie. I won't go!

36:24.642 --> 36:25.726
Why?

36:26.727 --> 36:30.189
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
I got a turkey in the oven.

36:30.898 --> 36:32.942
Oh, a turkey in the oven.

36:39.657 --> 36:41.409
Turkey in the oven.

36:48.499 --> 36:52.211
You want the bird?
Go in the alley and eat the bird!

36:52.837 --> 36:54.297
Aw, Paulie!

36:55.298 --> 36:58.259
I want you out of here!
Get out of the house!

36:58.509 --> 37:01.053
Go out and enjoy your freaking life!

37:05.266 --> 37:06.934
You hungry, Rock?

37:13.608 --> 37:17.320
Hey, yo, Paulie, maybe we better
forget all this, you know?

37:17.820 --> 37:20.948
Forget nothing. Go ahead.
Tell her something funny.

37:21.032 --> 37:24.202
Ain't nothing to talk about.
She's in a bad mood. I'm in a bad mood.

37:24.285 --> 37:27.038
You can do funny things.
You wanna go out with my sister?

37:27.121 --> 37:28.664
- Yeah.
- Well...

37:32.877 --> 37:34.504
I don't know what to say.

37:34.587 --> 37:35.755
Funny.

37:47.391 --> 37:49.519
Yo, Adrian. It's me, Rocky.

37:49.894 --> 37:51.562
Rocky, you know?

37:52.230 --> 37:53.439
Listen,

37:55.733 --> 38:00.196
I don't know what to say, 'cause I ain't
never talked to no door before.

38:01.364 --> 38:04.575
What do I say to a door?
We better forget this.

38:04.909 --> 38:06.077
You're doing fine.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.496
I ain't doing fine. I look like an idiot.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.581
Keep doing what you're doing. Funny.

38:10.665 --> 38:12.875
I know all about these things.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.710
I feel like a jerk.

38:20.716 --> 38:23.135
Yo, Adrian, it's Rocky again.

38:23.219 --> 38:27.807
Listen, I know you ain't too happy
at this moment.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.017
But could you do me a favor?

38:30.101 --> 38:33.104
I ain't got nobody
to spend Thanksgiving with.

38:33.271 --> 38:36.607
So, how about maybe you and I

38:36.691 --> 38:38.484
go out together, get something to eat.

38:38.568 --> 38:41.112
Maybe laugh a little bit.
Who knows, you know?

38:41.195 --> 38:42.947
Would you like to...

38:44.782 --> 38:47.618
Would you like to, maybe,
you and me go out together?

38:47.702 --> 38:50.288
What do you think? Would you like to?

38:55.293 --> 38:57.503
We're gonna have a good time.

38:57.879 --> 39:00.047
We'll have a real good time.

39:04.594 --> 39:06.387
Thanks for the bird.

39:10.016 --> 39:12.935
I'm gonna turn the TV off.
I got a headache.

39:25.281 --> 39:27.700
- What's your sister like to do?
- Ice-skate.

39:27.783 --> 39:29.785
Adrian, come on.
You're letting the heat out.

39:29.869 --> 39:32.163
Who pays the bills around here?

39:37.752 --> 39:40.880
Listen, I don't want no turkey anyway,
you know?

39:42.465 --> 39:44.467
But it was Thanksgiving.

39:45.301 --> 39:46.427
What?

39:46.511 --> 39:48.471
- It was Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, to you.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.848
But to me it's Thursday, right?

40:15.206 --> 40:17.875
- It looks kind of quiet.
- I think it's closed.

40:17.959 --> 40:21.087
No, I think we're just early
or something like that.

40:22.505 --> 40:24.340
- We're closed.
- What?

40:24.674 --> 40:27.635
- I said we're closed.
- Yeah. Hey, listen.

40:27.718 --> 40:31.055
I'm gonna smooth this guy out. Wait here.
I'll be right back.

40:31.264 --> 40:33.057
- We could go someplace else.
- No, it's okay.

40:33.140 --> 40:37.103
Are you closed to the general public,
or are you just closed to everybody?

40:37.186 --> 40:41.357
It's after 6:00. It's Thanksgiving.
That's why there's nobody here.

40:41.691 --> 40:43.734
Besides, you ain't supposed to be in here.

40:43.818 --> 40:46.320
So do me a favor and not stay here.

40:46.404 --> 40:49.949
- Could you do me a favor?
- Come on. We're not operating.

40:50.199 --> 40:53.035
Look. This girl here ain't feeling well.

40:53.119 --> 40:55.663
Doctors say she should go out
and exercise.

40:55.746 --> 40:57.874
Ice-skating's probably the best thing.

40:57.957 --> 40:59.208
So what do you want from me?

40:59.292 --> 41:01.169
Well, hey, I want you to do me a favor.

41:01.252 --> 41:02.837
You can see she ain't feeling too good.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.923
If you can let her on the ice
for a few minutes, I'd appreciate it.

41:06.007 --> 41:07.800
Ten minutes, ten bucks.

41:07.884 --> 41:10.052
Ten bucks? How about eight bucks?

41:10.136 --> 41:12.263
Come on. It's Thanksgiving.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.390
All right. Nine bucks, you got a deal.

41:14.473 --> 41:17.226
You have the ice to yourself. Ten bucks.

41:19.353 --> 41:21.105
Give her the blades.

41:21.898 --> 41:23.191
Aren't you skating?

41:23.274 --> 41:25.234
No, I ain't skated since I was 15.

41:25.318 --> 41:27.612
That's when I started fighting.

41:27.904 --> 41:30.573
Skating's kind of bad for the ankles,
you know?

41:31.532 --> 41:34.285
You're a pretty good skater, aren't you?

41:35.077 --> 41:37.580
Like I was saying
before on the way over here,

41:37.663 --> 41:40.833
fighting used to be tops with me,
but no more.

41:40.917 --> 41:43.419
All I wanted to do out of fighting
was prove I was no bum,

41:43.503 --> 41:45.922
that I had the stuff to make a good pro.

41:46.005 --> 41:49.008
- You never got the chance?
- I ain't crying about it.

41:49.091 --> 41:51.344
I still fight. I do it like a hobby.

41:51.427 --> 41:53.596
The trouble is I'm a southpaw.

41:53.679 --> 41:56.599
- What's a southpaw?
- A southpaw means you're left-handed.

41:56.682 --> 41:59.060
A southpaw throws your timing off.

41:59.143 --> 42:01.437
It throws other guys' timing off,
makes them look awkward.

42:01.521 --> 42:03.105
Nobody wants to look awkward.

42:03.189 --> 42:06.359
- You know where "southpaw" came from?
- Nine minutes!

42:06.442 --> 42:09.487
A long time ago, there was this guy,
maybe a couple hundred years ago,

42:09.570 --> 42:13.032
he was fighting in the...
I think it was around Philadelphia.

42:13.115 --> 42:17.078
His arm... He was left-handed.
His arm was facing towards New Jersey.

42:17.161 --> 42:20.998
And that's south. So naturally
they called him "south paw." You see?

42:21.082 --> 42:24.377
Southpaw, South Jersey, South Camden.

42:24.836 --> 42:26.671
Southpaw. You know what I mean?

42:28.172 --> 42:30.299
Things probably worked out for the best,
don't you think?

42:30.383 --> 42:33.052
Never got a chance
because you're left-handed, huh?

42:33.135 --> 42:35.221
That's absolutely true, you know?

42:35.304 --> 42:36.556
Watch out.

42:38.558 --> 42:41.602
Ah! Ah! I just dislocated my finger.

42:41.936 --> 42:43.479
Ah! Look at that.

42:44.230 --> 42:46.023
Wait. It ain't your fault. Look.

42:46.107 --> 42:48.484
See? I had it... It's an old wound.

42:48.568 --> 42:50.820
You see that? Look. See?

42:50.903 --> 42:52.321
Nothing. It bends like that.

42:52.405 --> 42:55.366
I originally done it... Push the button.
Bong. It works.

42:55.449 --> 42:58.327
- It ain't your fault. Look.
- Seven minutes!

42:59.078 --> 43:02.081
I originally done it...
I carry pictures of all my fights.

43:02.165 --> 43:04.917
I originally done it
in the Baby Crenshaw fight.

43:05.001 --> 43:08.045
Baby's about the size of an airplane.
I broke both hands on his face.

43:08.129 --> 43:11.507
I lost that fight, but that's a nice picture,
don't you think?

43:11.591 --> 43:12.925
Real nice.

43:14.385 --> 43:16.762
Come on. You having a good time?

43:17.471 --> 43:19.390
You can see I ain't too graceful.

43:19.473 --> 43:23.853
I don't move well, but I can really swat.
I can really hit hard.

43:23.936 --> 43:27.607
But I'm a southpaw,
and nobody wants to fight no southpaw.

43:32.820 --> 43:35.573
You know how I got started in fighting?

43:35.656 --> 43:36.741
No.

43:37.533 --> 43:39.452
Am I talking too loud?

43:39.744 --> 43:41.329
Three minutes!

43:41.412 --> 43:45.958
My father, he's a...
My old man, he was never too smart.

43:46.042 --> 43:48.127
He says to me,
"You weren't born with much of a brain,

43:48.211 --> 43:50.713
"so you better start using your body."

43:50.796 --> 43:52.715
So I become a fighter.

43:53.382 --> 43:55.134
You know what I mean?

43:55.218 --> 43:57.053
Why you laughing?

43:58.387 --> 44:01.307
My mother, she said the opposite thing.

44:01.390 --> 44:03.643
What did she say the opposite?

44:04.268 --> 44:06.562
She said,
"You weren't born with much of a body,

44:06.646 --> 44:08.397
"so you better develop your brain."

44:08.481 --> 44:11.234
- Did she say that?
- Yo, time!

44:12.527 --> 44:15.404
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

44:16.656 --> 44:20.076
- Why do you wanna fight?
- 'Cause I can't sing or dance.

44:21.744 --> 44:23.454
Don't fall!

44:24.705 --> 44:27.124
That was terrific. I'm pretty good at this.

44:27.208 --> 44:28.459
You like the way I skate?

44:28.543 --> 44:31.587
Last fight I had,
I had with this guy named Spider Rico.

44:31.671 --> 44:34.382
He busted my head up there.
You see that scar?

44:34.465 --> 44:37.468
I'll tell you,
things get pretty rough in the ring.

44:46.936 --> 44:49.897
You know,
some people are very shy by nature.

44:50.815 --> 44:52.191
I suppose.

44:55.111 --> 44:57.989
I say you're very shy by nature, you know?

44:59.240 --> 45:00.616
I suppose.

45:03.286 --> 45:05.037
The bum from the dark.

45:05.121 --> 45:06.789
Get a job, you bum!

45:07.623 --> 45:10.501
Some people think
that being shy is a disease,

45:10.585 --> 45:12.545
but it don't bother me none.

45:12.628 --> 45:14.547
Don't bother me either.

45:15.882 --> 45:18.009
So why'd I bother bringing it up?

45:18.092 --> 45:20.261
'Cause I'm dumb, that's why.

45:21.512 --> 45:23.556
I think we make
a sharp couple of coconuts.

45:23.639 --> 45:26.475
I'm dumb and you're shy.
What do you think?

45:28.728 --> 45:32.315
I don't understand
why anybody would wanna be a fighter.

45:32.648 --> 45:37.945
You gotta be a moron to wanna
be a fighter, you know what I mean?

45:38.488 --> 45:41.991
It's a racket where you're
almost guaranteed to end up a bum.

45:42.074 --> 45:45.495
- I don't think you're a bum.
- I'm at least half a bum.

45:45.703 --> 45:47.872
But I'll tell you something.

45:48.748 --> 45:51.334
Worst thing about fighting
is the morning after.

45:51.417 --> 45:52.793
- You know?
- Morning after.

45:52.877 --> 45:54.754
Yeah, the morning after a fight,

45:54.837 --> 45:57.381
you're like a large wound,
you know what I mean?

45:57.465 --> 45:59.509
Sometimes I got pains all over me.

45:59.592 --> 46:03.304
I feel like calling a taxi to take me
from the bed into the bathroom.

46:03.387 --> 46:05.264
Your hair hurts, your eyes hurt.

46:05.348 --> 46:08.226
Your face is busted up.
Your hands are swollen.

46:08.309 --> 46:11.395
Look at this face. Sixty-four fights.
Look at that nose.

46:11.479 --> 46:14.232
You see that nose?
That nose ain't never been broken.

46:14.315 --> 46:16.651
I had guys busting on it.

46:16.734 --> 46:19.779
I had guys chewing on it,
twisting and punching it.

46:19.862 --> 46:21.447
I mean, whack, boom.

46:21.531 --> 46:24.033
These guys are hitting my nose
all the time.

46:24.116 --> 46:26.077
Never broke it. I'm very proud of that.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.745
That's rare.

46:27.829 --> 46:30.873
- Why do you do it if it hurts?
- Why you think?

46:32.291 --> 46:34.919
'Cause you can't sing and dance?

46:35.211 --> 46:37.713
Yeah, something like that.

46:37.797 --> 46:39.924
Hey, you wanna come inside?

46:42.260 --> 46:43.511
No, I gotta go.

46:43.594 --> 46:45.555
Hey, come on. I got some animals.

46:45.638 --> 46:48.057
I got these very rare animals inside.

46:48.140 --> 46:49.725
Come on in.

46:49.809 --> 46:51.227
No, I gotta go.

46:51.310 --> 46:54.146
I gotta go, too, to the bathroom. Come on.

46:54.730 --> 46:55.898
Come on.

46:55.982 --> 46:57.733
No, I gotta go.

46:57.817 --> 47:01.445
Look at this face.
Is that a face you could trust or what?

47:01.737 --> 47:05.908
Is it? They ought to stick this face
on a stamp. What do you think?

47:06.492 --> 47:08.077
Come on in.

47:13.666 --> 47:15.084
Yo, come on.

47:35.813 --> 47:37.023
Click.

47:42.653 --> 47:44.447
Yo, Adrian, you hungry?

47:44.530 --> 47:45.907
No.

47:45.990 --> 47:47.658
I got some things in there.

47:47.742 --> 47:50.620
If you like sodas, doughnuts or something.

47:50.786 --> 47:52.955
Got a couple cupcakes. Huh?

47:53.164 --> 47:54.248
No?

47:54.582 --> 47:57.126
I got some chocolate in there. No?

48:05.801 --> 48:07.720
Hot in here, you know?

48:09.805 --> 48:11.933
I could go for some music.

48:17.563 --> 48:18.981
Yo, Adrian.

48:19.398 --> 48:22.235
These are the exotic animals
I was telling you about.

48:22.318 --> 48:24.445
These are my friends, Cuff and Link.

48:24.529 --> 48:27.281
- I sold them to you.
- I know you sold them to me.

48:27.365 --> 48:29.867
Remember you were working
at that pet shop?

48:29.951 --> 48:33.412
First day you was there, and I came in
and bought both these animals?

48:33.496 --> 48:34.622
I remember that.

48:34.705 --> 48:38.417
I bought this bowl
and the animals themselves.

48:38.501 --> 48:41.087
Some food,
the marbles that go on the bottom there.

48:41.170 --> 48:43.130
Remember that mountain?

48:43.214 --> 48:47.385
I had to get rid of that mountain.
They kept fall over and flipping.

48:50.805 --> 48:53.641
Why don't you come over here
and sit down?

48:55.852 --> 48:58.229
It's a nice couch. I don't know.

49:00.398 --> 49:03.484
There's big bugs in there.
It's safer over here.

49:06.070 --> 49:07.822
You wanna sit down?

49:14.537 --> 49:16.080
These your parents?

49:16.164 --> 49:18.416
Yeah, that's both of them there.

49:18.499 --> 49:21.169
- Is this you?
- Yeah. I was eight years old.

49:21.252 --> 49:24.338
That's the Italian Stallion
when he was a baby.

49:26.507 --> 49:29.719
Come on over.
Make yourself comfortable. Relax.

49:35.183 --> 49:36.475
Do you have a phone?

49:36.559 --> 49:38.436
No, I had it pulled.

49:38.519 --> 49:40.354
'Cause people calling all the time,

49:40.438 --> 49:43.149
and who needs the aggravation, right?

49:43.232 --> 49:44.734
Interruptions.

49:45.109 --> 49:46.861
Who'd you wanna call?

49:46.944 --> 49:49.655
I wanna let my brother know where I am.

49:50.448 --> 49:51.532
Why?

49:53.201 --> 49:54.869
I think he might be worried.

49:54.952 --> 49:58.039
I'll call your brother, if that's the problem.

50:00.500 --> 50:02.752
Yo, Paulie! Your sister's with me!

50:02.835 --> 50:05.463
I'll call you back later! See you!

50:12.094 --> 50:14.388
You don't like the room, do you?

50:14.472 --> 50:17.391
- It's fine.
- It's only temporary.

50:18.059 --> 50:19.602
It's not that.

50:24.524 --> 50:27.568
What's the problem? You don't like me?

50:27.652 --> 50:29.862
You don't like the turtles?
What's the problem?

50:29.946 --> 50:32.698
- I don't think I belong here.
- It's okay.

50:35.493 --> 50:37.286
I don't belong here.

50:37.954 --> 50:41.249
Well, you know, it's okay,
'cause you're my guest.

50:42.375 --> 50:45.378
I don't know you well enough.

50:45.461 --> 50:48.756
I've never been
in a man's apartment alone.

50:50.591 --> 50:53.427
Well, they're all the same, you know?

50:58.599 --> 51:01.185
I'm not sure I know you well enough.

51:02.562 --> 51:04.605
I don't feel comfortable.

51:04.772 --> 51:07.650
Yo, Adrian, I ain't so comfortable either.

51:10.069 --> 51:11.612
I should go.

51:11.696 --> 51:13.990
Don't go, please. Don't go.

51:16.033 --> 51:17.326
Don't go.

51:20.913 --> 51:22.540
Do me a favor.

51:22.623 --> 51:23.833
What?

51:23.916 --> 51:25.835
Take off these glasses.

51:29.505 --> 51:31.799
You have nice eyes, you know?

51:33.634 --> 51:35.428
Do me another favor?

51:36.429 --> 51:38.806
Why don't you take off that hat?

51:45.104 --> 51:47.315
I always knew you was pretty.

51:48.858 --> 51:51.486
- Don't tease me.
- I'm not teasing you.

51:54.864 --> 51:56.657
I ain't teasing you.

51:57.742 --> 52:00.369
I just wanna... I wanna kiss you.

52:02.997 --> 52:06.042
You don't have to kiss me back
if you don't wanna,

52:06.125 --> 52:07.960
but I wanna kiss you.

53:20.366 --> 53:23.411
- Heard you had a fight coming up.
- Next month.

53:23.494 --> 53:25.246
January 27, right?

53:25.329 --> 53:27.248
That's good. Come down to the gym.

53:27.331 --> 53:29.625
We'll get you in shape.
How's your weight?

53:29.709 --> 53:32.587
- 175.
- Hey, Rock. How you doing?

53:32.670 --> 53:34.839
Mick was looking for you up there, man.

53:34.922 --> 53:37.133
- For me? You're sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

53:37.216 --> 53:39.343
He's looking for you.
Get up there and see him.

53:39.427 --> 53:41.846
- He wanted me?
- Yeah. Your name's Rock, right?

53:41.929 --> 53:43.848
- Yeah.
- All right. Go on, babe.

53:58.154 --> 53:59.989
You got something for me?

54:00.072 --> 54:02.909
Yeah, there was some guy
from Miles Jergens looking for you.

54:02.992 --> 54:06.454
They need sparring partners
for Apollo Creed. There's the card.

54:06.537 --> 54:08.247
- When was he here?
- About an hour ago.

54:08.331 --> 54:11.626
They're probably looking
for sparring partners for Creed.

54:11.709 --> 54:14.128
I said that before, you dumb Dago!

54:15.671 --> 54:18.883
I been coming here for six years,
and six years you been sticking it to me.

54:18.966 --> 54:21.469
- How come?
- You don't wanna know!

54:21.552 --> 54:23.304
Yeah, I wanna know how come.

54:23.387 --> 54:25.431
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know now!

54:25.515 --> 54:27.558
Okay, I'm gonna tell you!

54:27.642 --> 54:31.687
You had the talent to become
a good fighter, and instead of that,

54:31.771 --> 54:35.900
you became a leg breaker
for some cheap, second-rate loan shark!

54:36.818 --> 54:37.985
It's a living.

54:38.069 --> 54:39.904
It's a waste of life!

54:58.506 --> 55:00.299
Yes. May I help you?

55:05.555 --> 55:08.099
Oh, you must be Mr. Rocky Balboa.

55:08.182 --> 55:11.018
Mr. Jergens's expecting you.
Just a moment.

55:16.190 --> 55:18.609
Mr. Rocky Balboa to see you, sir.

55:19.152 --> 55:20.278
Fine.

55:21.028 --> 55:23.531
- Please go in, Mr. Balboa.
- Can I have that?

55:23.614 --> 55:26.033
- Oh, certainly.
- Thanks.

55:30.830 --> 55:32.206
Mr. Balboa.

55:32.957 --> 55:34.750
How are you? George Jergens.

55:34.834 --> 55:36.460
Take a chair, please.

55:36.544 --> 55:37.753
Thanks.

55:39.589 --> 55:41.007
Mr. Balboa.

55:41.549 --> 55:43.426
Call me Rocky.

55:43.509 --> 55:45.553
Rocky, you got any representation?

55:45.636 --> 55:47.138
You have a manager?

55:47.221 --> 55:48.639
No, just me.

55:50.266 --> 55:54.061
Rocky, I've got a proposition
I'd like to make to you.

55:54.520 --> 55:57.690
- About sparring?
- Beg your pardon?

55:57.773 --> 56:02.236
I know you're looking for
sparring partners, and I'm very available.

56:02.445 --> 56:04.280
- I'm sure you are.
- Absolutely.

56:04.363 --> 56:05.865
Sparring with the champ
would be an honor,

56:05.948 --> 56:07.200
and you know what, Mr. Jergens?

56:07.283 --> 56:09.160
- What?
- I wouldn't take no cheap shots.

56:09.243 --> 56:11.412
I'd really be a good sparring partner.

56:11.496 --> 56:13.789
You don't understand me, Rocky.

56:14.207 --> 56:16.083
My proposition's this.

56:16.918 --> 56:19.337
Would you be interested
in fighting Apollo Creed

56:19.420 --> 56:22.131
for the world heavyweight championship?

56:26.719 --> 56:27.887
No.

56:27.970 --> 56:29.514
Listen, Rocky.

56:30.431 --> 56:32.433
Apollo's seen you fight.

56:33.267 --> 56:34.894
He likes you.

56:34.977 --> 56:36.729
He wants to fight you.

56:36.813 --> 56:38.606
Well, it's just that, you see,

56:38.689 --> 56:41.818
I fight in clubs, you know,
and I'm really a ham-and-egger.

56:41.901 --> 56:43.778
This guy, he's the best, and

56:43.861 --> 56:47.448
it wouldn't be such a good fight,
but thank you very much.

56:47.990 --> 56:49.408
I appreciate it.

56:49.492 --> 56:53.830
Rocky, do you believe that America
is the land of opportunity?

56:55.289 --> 56:56.374
Yeah.

56:57.208 --> 56:58.918
Apollo Creed does,

56:59.293 --> 57:01.254
and he's gonna prove it to the whole world

57:01.337 --> 57:04.048
by giving an unknown a shot at the title.

57:04.549 --> 57:06.551
And that unknown is you.

57:07.301 --> 57:09.136
He picked you, Rocky.

57:10.304 --> 57:12.598
It's the chance of a lifetime.

57:13.724 --> 57:15.643
You can't pass it by.

57:16.936 --> 57:18.563
What do you say?

57:24.443 --> 57:25.528
<i>All right, fellas. That's enough pictures.</i>

57:25.611 --> 57:27.446
<i>We wanna ask Apollo a few questions.</i>

57:27.530 --> 57:30.074
<i>Apollo, how do you like</i>
<i>the City of Brotherly Love?</i>

57:30.158 --> 57:33.578
<i>Well, just being in Philadelphia</i>
<i>makes me feel patriotic.</i>

57:33.661 --> 57:36.372
<i>Beautiful people in a beautiful city</i>
<i>coming up to me on the street,</i>

57:36.455 --> 57:37.623
<i>wishing me the best.</i>

57:37.707 --> 57:40.459
<i>I love my Philadelphia brothers,</i>
<i>and I'm proud to be an American.</i>

57:40.543 --> 57:42.086
<i>Apollo? Champ?</i>

57:42.170 --> 57:46.007
<i>Why did you agree to fight a man</i>
<i>who has virtually no chance of winning?</i>

57:46.090 --> 57:48.384
<i>If history proves one thing,</i>

57:48.467 --> 57:52.221
<i>American history proves that</i>
<i>everybody's got a chance to win.</i>

57:52.305 --> 57:55.433
<i>Didn't you guys ever hear</i>
<i>of Valley Forge or Bunker Hill?</i>

57:55.516 --> 57:57.018
<i>Apollo?</i>

57:57.101 --> 57:59.645
<i>It is a coincidence</i>
<i>that you're fighting a white man</i>

57:59.729 --> 58:01.689
<i>on the most celebrated day</i>
<i>in the country's history?</i>

58:01.772 --> 58:04.984
<i>I don't know. Is it a coincidence</i>
<i>that he's fighting a black man</i>

58:05.067 --> 58:07.403
<i>on the most celebrated day</i>
<i>in the country's history?</i>

58:07.487 --> 58:09.489
<i>- Right on, Apollo!</i>
<i>- Tell the truth, brother!</i>

58:09.572 --> 58:12.158
<i>Listen, Apollo.</i>
<i>How do you feel about your challenger?</i>

58:12.241 --> 58:14.994
<i>How do I feel about him? Come here, Rock.</i>

58:15.453 --> 58:16.787
<i>My main man.</i>

58:16.871 --> 58:19.540
<i>- Rocky, ain't you Italian?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm Italian.</i>

58:19.624 --> 58:21.334
<i>Now what does that mean?</i>

58:21.417 --> 58:24.295
<i>That means, if he can't fight,</i>
<i>I'll bet he can cook.</i>

58:26.005 --> 58:28.549
Do me a favor. His lungs, punch out.

58:28.633 --> 58:30.051
Paulie.

58:30.134 --> 58:33.346
<i>Rocky, how do you expect</i>
<i>to fight Apollo Creed?</i>

58:33.888 --> 58:36.140
<i>Oh, jeez, you know, Creed's the best.</i>

58:36.224 --> 58:37.892
<i>I guess I'll have to do the best I can.</i>

58:37.975 --> 58:40.645
<i>Tell me, Rocky, just between us,</i>

58:40.728 --> 58:43.773
<i>where did you get</i>
<i>the name "Italian Stallion"?</i>

58:43.856 --> 58:48.277
<i>Oh, I invented that about eight years ago</i>
<i>when I was eating dinner.</i>

58:48.361 --> 58:53.157
<i>Rocky, now your payday will be $150,000.</i>

58:53.282 --> 58:54.700
<i>Any comment?</i>

58:56.911 --> 58:59.831
<i>- You got no comment, Rocky, right?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

58:59.914 --> 59:01.374
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

59:01.457 --> 59:04.377
<i>I just wanna say hi to my girlfriend, okay?</i>

59:04.460 --> 59:06.546
<i>Yo, Adrian, it's me, Rocky.</i>

59:07.672 --> 59:10.424
<i>You believe all this?</i>
<i>Microphones and all that stuff.</i>

59:10.508 --> 59:11.634
You didn't.

59:11.717 --> 59:14.053
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>
<i>- Who you pushing, man?</i>

59:14.136 --> 59:16.472
<i>- Smack you in the mouth!</i>
<i>- Thank you, Rocky.</i>

59:16.556 --> 59:18.432
Don't it matter he making you out a fool?

59:18.516 --> 59:20.101
I'd break his lips.

59:20.226 --> 59:23.855
- He's taking cheap shots.
- Don't bother me none.

59:23.938 --> 59:28.776
Yo, Rocky, I guess you'll be looking
for people to help you out.

59:28.860 --> 59:30.153
Help what?

59:30.236 --> 59:31.445
You know,

59:31.529 --> 59:33.447
keep you living the clean life.

59:33.531 --> 59:35.783
I do okay, you know.

59:35.867 --> 59:37.827
You need someone
to help with the exercise

59:37.910 --> 59:41.747
and someone standing by with a towel
or running errands?

59:41.831 --> 59:44.584
Hey, yo, Paulie,
who cared about me yesterday? Nobody.

59:44.667 --> 59:47.253
So I just think I'm gonna train myself,
you know?

59:47.336 --> 59:49.505
Without such good people around
to help you,

59:49.589 --> 59:52.049
you don't have such a good chance.

59:52.175 --> 59:54.760
Einstein flunked out of school twice.

59:55.094 --> 59:56.304
That so?

59:56.470 --> 01:00:00.349
Yeah. Beethoven was deaf.
Helen Keller was blind.

01:00:00.933 --> 01:00:03.352
I think Rocky's got a good chance.

01:00:09.066 --> 01:00:11.152
Want me to get you a beer, Paulie?

01:00:11.235 --> 01:00:14.989
You looking to do a good deed?
Keep out of my freaking life!

01:00:15.907 --> 01:00:17.783
- What'd I do?
- Nothing.

01:00:17.867 --> 01:00:19.452
Did I say something wrong?

01:00:19.535 --> 01:00:21.287
You didn't say nothing. It's all right.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:23.372
That's right! You didn't say nothing!

01:00:23.456 --> 01:00:24.999
Nothing at all!

01:00:27.001 --> 01:00:28.419
I gotta go.

01:00:29.587 --> 01:00:31.964
Where are the freaking pretzels?

01:00:35.009 --> 01:00:36.969
I'd like to have a pretzel.

01:00:37.053 --> 01:00:39.138
Hey, we ain't got any beer?

01:00:40.014 --> 01:00:43.184
I thought you were supposed to
pick up some beer!

01:00:51.025 --> 01:00:53.653
How'd you like hearing your name
on TV tonight?

01:00:55.404 --> 01:00:56.906
I was shocked.

01:00:56.989 --> 01:00:58.407
Why'd you do that?

01:00:58.491 --> 01:01:00.243
You're putting me on, right?

01:01:00.326 --> 01:01:01.702
Absolutely.

01:01:02.495 --> 01:01:05.248
- What time should I expect you?
- About 7:00.

01:01:05.331 --> 01:01:07.250
- Okay.
- Hey.

01:01:24.767 --> 01:01:28.229
You know how I said
that stuff on TV didn't bother me?

01:01:28.646 --> 01:01:29.772
Yeah.

01:01:32.233 --> 01:01:33.526
It did.

01:01:44.162 --> 01:01:47.748
Listen, the reason I brought you here
is because

01:01:47.832 --> 01:01:50.168
I wanna know if you got any money
for training expenses.

01:01:50.251 --> 01:01:52.003
I got a few dollars.

01:01:52.086 --> 01:01:54.338
A few bucks? Here. Put this in your glove.

01:01:54.422 --> 01:01:57.466
- What's this?
- $500. Don't worry about it.

01:01:58.718 --> 01:02:00.636
You know, you ain't never had any luck,

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.222
but I think this time Lady Luck
may be in your corner.

01:02:03.306 --> 01:02:06.225
- What do you think?
- Maybe.

01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:08.227
Thanks for the money, Tony.

01:02:08.311 --> 01:02:11.397
It's okay. Don't worry about it. I'll see you.

01:02:11.689 --> 01:02:13.483
- Wait a minute.
- What?

01:02:13.566 --> 01:02:15.693
You're in training. Come on.

01:02:23.826 --> 01:02:25.453
- Yo, Tony.
- What?

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:28.581
You gonna show up at the fight?

01:02:28.664 --> 01:02:29.957
Ringside.

01:02:32.376 --> 01:02:33.878
I'll see you.

01:03:09.121 --> 01:03:10.248
Yeah.

01:03:15.753 --> 01:03:19.257
Hello, kid. I seen your light. Can I come in?

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:21.634
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Good.

01:03:21.717 --> 01:03:23.803
Hey, it's a nice place here.

01:03:24.637 --> 01:03:27.431
Anyway, what I come to tell you is that,

01:03:28.808 --> 01:03:32.061
that what happened to you is freak luck.

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:34.063
- Yeah, freak luck.
- Ain't it true?

01:03:34.147 --> 01:03:36.649
Look at the other guys.
They're good fighters, right?

01:03:36.732 --> 01:03:39.443
They're colorful. They got good records.

01:03:39.527 --> 01:03:41.821
They fight their guts out for peanuts.

01:03:41.904 --> 01:03:45.867
But you, you got a shot at the title!

01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:48.411
Freak luck is a strange thing, you know?

01:03:48.494 --> 01:03:50.997
- Sure is. Can I sit down?
- Yeah, sure.

01:03:52.623 --> 01:03:55.710
- What the hell are those?
- Domestic turtles.

01:03:55.793 --> 01:03:58.337
The one on the top is Cuff
and the other guy's Link.

01:03:58.421 --> 01:03:59.630
The rest are marbles.

01:03:59.714 --> 01:04:02.049
Yeah? They make good soup.

01:04:02.758 --> 01:04:03.968
Anyway.

01:04:04.051 --> 01:04:06.929
Look, I'm here to warn you.

01:04:07.013 --> 01:04:11.517
You gotta be very careful
about this shot that you got at the title.

01:04:11.601 --> 01:04:14.395
Because, like the Bible says,

01:04:14.479 --> 01:04:16.647
you ain't gonna get a second chance.

01:04:16.731 --> 01:04:18.858
Yeah. All right.

01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:20.860
You thought of that, huh?

01:04:20.943 --> 01:04:24.363
Well, what you need is a manager.

01:04:25.281 --> 01:04:27.366
A manager. Listen to me.

01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:31.204
I know, because I been in this racket
for 50 years.

01:04:31.287 --> 01:04:34.540
- 50 years, huh?
- 50 years. I've seen it all.

01:04:34.624 --> 01:04:37.960
- All of it. You know what I done?
- What?

01:04:38.044 --> 01:04:40.046
I have done it all.

01:04:40.129 --> 01:04:43.883
You should've seen me when I knocked
that guinea Russo out of the ring.

01:04:43.966 --> 01:04:45.885
Out of the goddamn ring, I tell you.

01:04:45.968 --> 01:04:48.012
September 14, 1923,

01:04:48.095 --> 01:04:52.433
and it was the same night
that Firpo knocks Dempsey out of the ring.

01:04:52.517 --> 01:04:54.894
So who gets the publicity? Figure that out.

01:04:54.977 --> 01:04:56.896
- Dempsey.
- That's right. But why?

01:04:56.979 --> 01:05:00.817
- 'Cause he was champ.
- No! Because he had a manager.

01:05:00.983 --> 01:05:02.527
I had nothing.

01:05:03.903 --> 01:05:06.405
I wanna show you something.
I want you to look at my face.

01:05:06.489 --> 01:05:09.784
Look at this.
I got 21 stitches over this left eye.

01:05:09.867 --> 01:05:12.328
I got 34 stitches over this eye.

01:05:12.411 --> 01:05:15.832
You know I had my nose busted 17 times.

01:05:15.915 --> 01:05:20.503
The last time
was in that fight with Sailor Mike.

01:05:20.586 --> 01:05:23.506
I got that clipping here.
It was a good fight.

01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:25.508
Wanna read that?

01:05:25.591 --> 01:05:27.718
Well, it doesn't matter.

01:05:27.802 --> 01:05:31.264
Anyway, he put this vegetation on my ear.

01:05:36.769 --> 01:05:40.690
You kind of remind me of the Rock,
you know that?

01:05:40.773 --> 01:05:42.817
- You really think so?
- That's right.

01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:46.279
You move like him,
and you got heart like he did.

01:05:46.362 --> 01:05:49.949
Yeah, I got heart,
but I ain't got no locker, do I, Mick?

01:05:53.786 --> 01:05:55.538
Anyway.

01:05:55.621 --> 01:05:58.708
You know, when I begun
in this business, kid...

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.964
I wanna make a suggestion.
Don't drink that piss before a fight.

01:06:05.047 --> 01:06:07.175
It's no good for you.

01:06:07.842 --> 01:06:09.635
If you don't mind my saying.

01:06:09.719 --> 01:06:11.971
Anyway, you know,
when I started in this racket,

01:06:12.054 --> 01:06:14.265
pugs like us, we was treated like dogs.

01:06:14.348 --> 01:06:16.767
For $10, you got to
tear somebody's throat out.

01:06:16.851 --> 01:06:19.103
But I never had no management.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.483
One time, this son of a bitch that I fought,

01:06:23.566 --> 01:06:25.485
he put a nail right there.

01:06:25.568 --> 01:06:27.904
- In his thumb.
- In the thumb of the glove.

01:06:27.987 --> 01:06:33.117
He punched so many holes in my face,
I had spit shooting out of my cheeks.

01:06:33.659 --> 01:06:35.495
Can you imagine that?

01:06:35.578 --> 01:06:39.123
Anyway, when I tell you what I looked like
when I was in my prime.

01:06:39.207 --> 01:06:40.958
I want you to look at something.

01:06:41.042 --> 01:06:43.669
Look at that. That's the way I looked

01:06:44.587 --> 01:06:46.714
before these guys got at me.

01:06:46.797 --> 01:06:50.551
That's nice. You didn't take very good care
of the picture, though.

01:06:50.635 --> 01:06:53.846
Well, I never had no management.

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:56.182
That's the trouble,
but now I got all this knowledge.

01:06:56.265 --> 01:06:59.018
I got it up here.
Now I wanna give it to you.

01:06:59.101 --> 01:07:01.771
I wanna give you this knowledge.
I wanna take care of you.

01:07:01.854 --> 01:07:05.066
I wanna make sure that what happened
to me doesn't happen to you.

01:07:05.149 --> 01:07:06.943
You know what I mean?

01:07:07.026 --> 01:07:08.861
Mick, the fight's set.

01:07:08.945 --> 01:07:11.531
Listen to me. I wanna be your manager.

01:07:11.614 --> 01:07:13.032
You follow that?

01:07:13.115 --> 01:07:15.326
Fight's set. I don't need no manager.

01:07:15.409 --> 01:07:17.745
But you can't buy
what I'm gonna give you.

01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:20.206
I got pain and I got experience.

01:07:20.289 --> 01:07:22.834
I got pain and I got experience too.

01:07:23.543 --> 01:07:24.961
Listen, kid.

01:07:25.169 --> 01:07:26.712
Hey, Mick.

01:07:26.796 --> 01:07:29.382
I needed your help
about 10 years ago, right?

01:07:29.465 --> 01:07:32.468
Ten years ago. You never helped me none.
You didn't care.

01:07:32.552 --> 01:07:34.387
If you wanted help...

01:07:35.012 --> 01:07:39.058
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you just ask me, kid?

01:07:39.142 --> 01:07:41.727
I asked, but you never heard nothing!

01:07:42.645 --> 01:07:44.021
Well, I...

01:07:47.275 --> 01:07:48.651
I know I...

01:07:48.734 --> 01:07:50.403
I'm 76 years old.

01:07:55.116 --> 01:07:56.325
And...

01:08:31.819 --> 01:08:34.279
Took you long enough to get here.

01:08:34.988 --> 01:08:37.200
Took 10 years to come to my house.

01:08:37.283 --> 01:08:39.285
You don't like my house?

01:08:39.993 --> 01:08:41.578
My house stink?

01:08:42.705 --> 01:08:44.707
That's right, it stinks!

01:08:44.790 --> 01:08:47.126
I didn't ask no favors from you!

01:08:50.212 --> 01:08:52.048
Talk about your prime.

01:08:52.548 --> 01:08:54.466
What about my prime, Mick?

01:08:54.716 --> 01:08:56.676
At least you had a prime!

01:08:57.428 --> 01:08:59.639
I ain't had no prime. I ain't had nothing.

01:08:59.721 --> 01:09:02.683
Legs are going, everything is going.
Nobody's giving me nothing.

01:09:02.767 --> 01:09:04.977
Guy comes up, offers me a fight. Big deal.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.522
Wanna fight the fight?
Yeah, I'll fight the big fight.

01:09:07.604 --> 01:09:11.192
I'm gonna go fight that big fight
and I'm gonna get that!

01:09:11.609 --> 01:09:13.361
I'm gonna get that!

01:09:14.569 --> 01:09:16.697
And you wanna be ringside and see?

01:09:16.781 --> 01:09:18.825
Do you? You wanna help me out?

01:09:18.908 --> 01:09:21.661
Do you wanna see me
get my face kicked in?

01:09:21.743 --> 01:09:23.746
Legs ain't working, nothing's working.

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:26.290
Think I'll go and fight the champ.

01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:28.542
Yeah, I'll fight him.

01:09:30.962 --> 01:09:32.839
Get my face kicked in.

01:09:33.714 --> 01:09:36.300
And you come around here.
You wanna move in with me?

01:09:36.384 --> 01:09:38.594
Come on in. It's a nice house!

01:09:39.178 --> 01:09:41.930
Real nice! Come on in! It stinks!

01:09:43.224 --> 01:09:45.225
This whole place stinks.

01:09:45.685 --> 01:09:47.562
You wanna help me out?

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:51.774
Well, help me out! Come on. Help me out.
I'm standing here!

01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:54.545
<i>It's only about 28 degrees.</i>
<i>We'll check that forecast.</i>

01:10:54.629 --> 01:10:57.548
<i>I feel very mischievous, very weird, very...</i>

01:10:58.883 --> 01:11:01.135
<i>I got vinyl seats in my car.</i>

01:11:01.219 --> 01:11:04.305
<i>When I hit those seats this morning,</i>
<i>I just went, "Whoo!"</i>

01:11:04.388 --> 01:11:08.643
<i>I figure if I'm up, everybody</i>
<i>in the Delaware Valley should be up.</i>

01:11:08.726 --> 01:11:10.061
<i>You agree with me?</i>

01:11:10.144 --> 01:11:13.981
<i>At three minutes past 4:00 in the morning,</i>
<i>what else you gonna do?</i>

01:11:15.483 --> 01:11:16.651
<i>Hello?</i>

01:11:16.734 --> 01:11:20.279
<i>Good morning, Mrs. Kramer.</i>
<i>This is Don Cabot, WYBG Philadelphia?</i>

01:11:20.363 --> 01:11:22.615
<i>- How are you this morning?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

01:11:22.698 --> 01:11:26.577
<i>You have a lot of nerve</i>
<i>calling me at this hour of the morning!</i>

01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:27.954
<i>Good-bye!</i>

01:11:41.133 --> 01:11:43.803
<i>Me and Mrs. Kramer are up,</i>
<i>and it's a good morning.</i>

01:11:43.886 --> 01:11:46.514
<i>I tell you, I need someone</i>
<i>to snuggle with. 28 degrees.</i>

01:11:46.597 --> 01:11:48.641
<i>It's cold out there. We deserve it.</i>

01:11:48.724 --> 01:11:51.185
<i>We've been getting away with murder</i>
<i>the last couple of weeks.</i>

01:11:51.269 --> 01:11:53.354
<i>Our high today could be...</i>

01:11:53.437 --> 01:11:56.315
<i>Tonight we're back down</i>
<i>in the 20-degree range.</i>

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:57.900
<i>A little colder in the suburbs.</i>

01:11:57.984 --> 01:12:01.195
<i>Tomorrow, with a little bit of luck,</i>
<i>we may hit 40.</i>

01:12:01.279 --> 01:12:03.197
<i>But it's 28. It's awfully chilly.</i>

01:12:03.281 --> 01:12:06.033
<i>Make sure you have it bundled up</i>
<i>before you bring it out.</i>

01:14:28.176 --> 01:14:29.427
Come on.

01:14:30.386 --> 01:14:32.972
It stinks in here, you know?

01:14:33.055 --> 01:14:34.849
Yeah. I know.

01:14:36.684 --> 01:14:38.895
Did you kill all these things?

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.439
No, across the street.

01:14:43.399 --> 01:14:46.194
It's like an animal morgue.

01:14:46.694 --> 01:14:48.529
It's a little cold in here, ain't it?

01:14:48.613 --> 01:14:49.697
Yeah.

01:14:54.202 --> 01:14:56.370
Who killed all these things?

01:14:56.871 --> 01:14:58.539
Are you crazy, Paulie?

01:14:58.623 --> 01:15:00.875
If you don't pay Gazzo,
you end up on a hook.

01:15:00.958 --> 01:15:03.127
Gazzo's a good man. You know that.

01:15:03.211 --> 01:15:05.004
Don't get excited. I know that.

01:15:05.087 --> 01:15:09.008
That's why I wanted you to talk to him
about me and the collecting job.

01:15:09.091 --> 01:15:11.594
And can get me out of
this stinking freezer.

01:15:11.677 --> 01:15:15.681
Why don't you do yourself a favor?
Keep this job. You eat better.

01:15:17.058 --> 01:15:18.142
Moo.

01:15:18.726 --> 01:15:20.853
Does it ever snow in here?

01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:25.817
You and my sister,
how you getting along together?

01:15:26.734 --> 01:15:28.402
How do you think?

01:15:28.945 --> 01:15:31.572
I'm not sure, Rock. What's the story?

01:15:32.573 --> 01:15:33.950
About what?

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.868
What's happening?

01:15:36.702 --> 01:15:38.412
You really like her?

01:15:38.496 --> 01:15:40.122
Sure, I like her.

01:15:42.208 --> 01:15:44.877
I don't see it. What's the attraction?

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.714
I don't know. Fills gaps, I guess.

01:15:49.423 --> 01:15:50.925
What's "gaps"?

01:15:51.259 --> 01:15:55.263
I don't know. She's got gaps.
I got gaps. Together we fill gaps.

01:15:57.765 --> 01:15:59.392
You balling her?

01:16:01.561 --> 01:16:04.272
You don't talk dirty about your sister.

01:16:06.107 --> 01:16:08.276
Are you screwing my sister?

01:16:10.736 --> 01:16:14.198
You see?
That's why I can't connect you with Gazzo.

01:16:14.282 --> 01:16:17.618
Because you got a big mouth.
You just talk too much.

01:16:18.619 --> 01:16:21.539
- It's cold in here. I'm going home.
- Cold in here?

01:16:21.622 --> 01:16:23.207
It is cold in here!

01:16:23.291 --> 01:16:25.710
It stinks in here, and you stink!

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.324
You're breaking the ribs.

01:17:15.676 --> 01:17:19.722
If you do that to Apollo Creed,
they'll put us in jail for murder.

01:17:21.516 --> 01:17:24.101
I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?

01:17:36.823 --> 01:17:39.075
- I turned the heat up.
- Thanks.

01:17:39.492 --> 01:17:43.412
Your brother's a good man,
but he's awful pushy, you know?

01:17:53.714 --> 01:17:56.759
- You want me to rub you down?
- No, I'm just sore, okay?

01:17:56.843 --> 01:17:59.095
- I'm gonna just sit here.
- You sure?

01:17:59.178 --> 01:18:00.596
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:18:04.267 --> 01:18:07.145
Hey, come on. No fooling around, all right?

01:18:07.478 --> 01:18:08.813
I'm tired.

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:11.649
Adrian, I'm serious now.

01:18:11.732 --> 01:18:13.609
There's no fooling around during training.

01:18:13.693 --> 01:18:15.444
I wanna stay strong.

01:18:15.778 --> 01:18:18.614
- You're not kidding.
- No, I ain't kidding.

01:18:21.617 --> 01:18:23.578
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:18:23.661 --> 01:18:26.372
Why don't you just make the meat, okay?

01:18:28.249 --> 01:18:30.251
Okay, I'll make the meat.

01:18:56.861 --> 01:18:58.779
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

01:19:31.479 --> 01:19:34.440
Underneath! Underneath!
Knock him out! Come on!

01:19:34.524 --> 01:19:36.609
Hold it. Hold it, Rock!

01:19:36.692 --> 01:19:40.696
You're driving me crazy. You're so sloppy
because you're off balance.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:42.698
Let's try this. Take this string.

01:19:42.782 --> 01:19:44.367
Tie it to both ankles.

01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:47.537
- Leave about two feet of slack.
- I never had good footwork.

01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:50.206
Never mind footwork.
Now you're all balanced.

01:19:50.289 --> 01:19:52.792
Marciano had the same problem

01:19:52.875 --> 01:19:55.044
and this string cured it.

01:19:55.545 --> 01:20:00.466
If you can move and hit without
breaking the string, you got balance!

01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:02.844
You become a dangerous person.

01:20:02.927 --> 01:20:04.887
- You follow me?
- Looking good, Rock.

01:20:04.971 --> 01:20:07.014
- Thanks.
- Let's go. That's it.

01:20:07.098 --> 01:20:09.016
- Underneath it.
- Hey, Rock.

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.185
- What?
- How about an autograph?

01:20:11.269 --> 01:20:12.687
Get out of here!

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:15.565
Don't interrupt me
while I'm conducting business.

01:20:15.648 --> 01:20:17.900
Move your little chicken asses out.

01:20:17.984 --> 01:20:22.196
Hey, listen, kid.
You lay off that pet shop dame.

01:20:22.613 --> 01:20:24.991
Women weaken legs.

01:20:26.242 --> 01:20:28.536
Yeah, but I really like this girl, you know?

01:20:28.619 --> 01:20:30.538
Then let her train you!

01:20:33.166 --> 01:20:35.126
Okay, no more fooling around.

01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:36.878
Okay. Now hit it.

01:20:38.546 --> 01:20:40.798
Women weaken legs, huh?

01:20:45.386 --> 01:20:46.929
- Yo, Rock.
- Yo, Rocky.

01:20:57.565 --> 01:20:59.108
You look great.

01:21:00.234 --> 01:21:02.069
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:21:02.278 --> 01:21:04.780
Terrific. I mean, you could be a heartbreak.

01:21:04.864 --> 01:21:07.658
You'll walk down the street
breaking hearts the way you're looking.

01:21:07.742 --> 01:21:08.826
Very sharp.

01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:11.496
I got another surprise for you.

01:21:11.579 --> 01:21:12.747
What?

01:21:13.372 --> 01:21:15.917
Butkus! Hey, Butkus.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.919
Come here, kid.

01:21:18.002 --> 01:21:20.379
To keep you company when you run.

01:21:25.384 --> 01:21:28.387
Come in and meet the family.
The owner never come back?

01:21:28.471 --> 01:21:30.431
Gloria says he's yours if you want him.

01:21:30.515 --> 01:21:33.226
Do I want him? What's he eat?

01:21:33.309 --> 01:21:35.186
He eats little turtles.

01:21:59.877 --> 01:22:01.587
What's that, Butkus?

01:22:01.671 --> 01:22:03.631
Whose truck is this? Come on.

01:22:06.092 --> 01:22:08.678
One call from me, you're a celebrity.

01:22:10.805 --> 01:22:12.265
You got... Need exposure.

01:22:12.348 --> 01:22:14.600
- Don't breathe on me.
- That's the big time.

01:22:14.684 --> 01:22:16.310
Don't I know about these things?

01:22:16.394 --> 01:22:18.563
You don't know nothing.
What do they want from me?

01:22:18.646 --> 01:22:20.314
To watch you train.

01:22:20.398 --> 01:22:23.109
What is the matter with you?
This is supposed to be private.

01:22:23.192 --> 01:22:25.611
- I'm doing you a favor.
- You ain't doing me no favors!

01:22:25.695 --> 01:22:27.613
You're embarrassing me
in front of everybody.

01:22:27.697 --> 01:22:29.657
You'll make me look bad
in front of your sis...

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:32.034
See this cigar?
I'm gonna stick it in your ear.

01:22:32.118 --> 01:22:35.246
Don't do these things to me.
You should've called me.

01:22:35.329 --> 01:22:37.665
Leave a message. Don't do that.

01:22:38.332 --> 01:22:40.459
My sister really likes you.

01:22:41.752 --> 01:22:44.005
I'm gonna kill you one of these days!

01:22:44.088 --> 01:22:45.339
Come on.

01:22:45.423 --> 01:22:47.133
- Baby!
- Baby.

01:22:47.758 --> 01:22:51.471
Here he is, the next heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

01:22:51.554 --> 01:22:53.473
Hello there. Rocky Balboa.

01:22:53.556 --> 01:22:55.475
We wanna get a brief interview with you.

01:22:55.558 --> 01:22:57.393
- What about me?
- What about you?

01:22:57.477 --> 01:22:59.812
- I'm in charge of the meat.
- Fine. Stand behind it.

01:22:59.896 --> 01:23:01.898
Settle yourself down. Relax.

01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:04.859
What we're going to do
is ask you a few questions.

01:23:04.942 --> 01:23:07.487
Just a few questions
about your unique training method.

01:23:07.570 --> 01:23:09.363
Talk to the folks at home.

01:23:09.447 --> 01:23:11.491
They really wanna know
how you got into this.

01:23:11.574 --> 01:23:14.202
This isn't an everyday thing.
Jimmy, you guys ready?

01:23:14.285 --> 01:23:16.412
Let's roll it. Rocky, turn around here.

01:23:16.496 --> 01:23:18.372
Just don't take no cheap shots, you know?

01:23:18.456 --> 01:23:20.374
No, I won't do that. Just relax.

01:23:20.458 --> 01:23:23.920
Today we're here with
heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.

01:23:24.003 --> 01:23:28.257
- The reason we're standing in this...
- The meat guy's sticking his face in.

01:23:28.341 --> 01:23:30.384
Let's try it again, Rocky.

01:23:31.219 --> 01:23:34.305
<i>Today we're here with</i>
<i>heavyweight challenger Rocky Balboa.</i>

01:23:34.388 --> 01:23:36.933
<i>The reason we're standing</i>
<i>in this refrigerated box</i>

01:23:37.016 --> 01:23:40.228
<i>is that Mr. Balboa</i>
<i>has an unusual method of training.</i>

01:23:40.311 --> 01:23:43.773
<i>In a moment, he'll demonstrate that</i>
<i>for the viewing audience at home.</i>

01:23:43.856 --> 01:23:47.443
<i>But first, Rocky,</i>
<i>how did you come to train in an icebox?</i>

01:23:48.069 --> 01:23:50.905
<i>Well, my friend, the guy over there,</i>

01:23:50.988 --> 01:23:53.825
<i>he let me in one day,</i>
<i>and I hit the beef here and liked it,</i>

01:23:53.908 --> 01:23:57.286
<i>and since I've become a challenger,</i>
<i>the owner don't mind that I come in.</i>

01:23:57.370 --> 01:24:01.249
<i>Is this a common training method?</i>
<i>Do other fighters pound raw meat?</i>

01:24:01.332 --> 01:24:03.292
<i>No, I think I invented it.</i>

01:24:03.376 --> 01:24:06.128
<i>- Would you give us a demonstration?</i>
- Confirm the reservation

01:24:06.212 --> 01:24:09.632
for my people at ringside,
and fly my barber to Philly.

01:24:13.094 --> 01:24:16.139
How much is being channeled
into West Coast closed-circuit advertising?

01:24:16.222 --> 01:24:18.474
- 300,000.
- Make it 450.

01:24:18.558 --> 01:24:20.977
And send the mayor's wife
200 roses from me,

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:23.813
and make sure we get a picture of it
for all the newspapers.

01:24:23.896 --> 01:24:26.983
Do you want to run the 15 radio spots
in the Midwest?

01:24:27.066 --> 01:24:29.652
You can spend your money better
in Canadian publicity.

01:24:29.735 --> 01:24:32.446
By the way, Apollo,
I've got friends in Toronto

01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:34.490
who can get you a good tax break.

01:24:34.574 --> 01:24:36.701
George, I like your friends.

01:24:44.667 --> 01:24:49.088
Hey, Champ. You ought to come
look at this boy you're gonna fight on TV.

01:24:49.755 --> 01:24:52.967
- Looks like he means business.
- Yeah, I mean business too.

01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:55.178
Shirley, we got any more coffee out there?

01:24:55.261 --> 01:24:57.889
Certainly, Mr. Creed.
I'll get you some right away.

01:24:57.972 --> 01:25:01.184
After the fight,
I may retire and run for emperor.

01:25:15.698 --> 01:25:18.034
<i>Diana Lewis in the meat house</i>

01:25:18.117 --> 01:25:20.578
<i>with southpaw Rocky Balboa.</i>

01:26:07.083 --> 01:26:09.043
And he called the reporters?

01:26:09.126 --> 01:26:11.712
Yeah. Threw my training schedule off.

01:26:11.796 --> 01:26:13.923
Don't be mad at him. He's trying to help.

01:26:14.006 --> 01:26:15.800
Adrian, I ain't mad,

01:26:15.883 --> 01:26:19.095
it's just that when reporters are
around, I get out of joint

01:26:19.178 --> 01:26:22.473
'cause they take cheap shots,
and Paulie knows that.

01:26:22.765 --> 01:26:25.893
And Paulie keeps asking me
for a job all the time

01:26:25.977 --> 01:26:28.729
but he don't know nothing about fighting.

01:26:28.813 --> 01:26:31.274
Are you gonna say anything to him?

01:26:32.066 --> 01:26:35.528
What's to say?
I just don't know what he wants from me.

01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:40.032
I don't want nothing from you.

01:26:40.783 --> 01:26:43.077
I don't want nothing from you.

01:26:43.953 --> 01:26:47.790
This ain't no charity case.
Get out of my house.

01:26:47.874 --> 01:26:49.876
It's not just your house.

01:26:50.835 --> 01:26:52.837
You're no friend no more.

01:26:53.212 --> 01:26:56.299
- Get out of my house, I just says.
- Don't talk to him like that.

01:26:56.382 --> 01:26:58.676
Both of you get out of my house!

01:27:00.678 --> 01:27:02.722
It's cold outside, Paulie.

01:27:12.732 --> 01:27:14.817
I don't want you messing her

01:27:14.901 --> 01:27:17.487
and I don't raise you
to go with this scum bum!

01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:19.322
Yeah? Come on! You wanna hit on me?

01:27:19.405 --> 01:27:23.242
Come on! I'll break both your arms
so they don't work for you.

01:27:25.578 --> 01:27:26.662
Stop it!

01:27:26.746 --> 01:27:30.041
I'm not good enough to meet with Gazzo?
That's what I think of Gazzo!

01:27:30.124 --> 01:27:34.670
Now you're a big shot fighter, you
don't even throw a crumb to your friend.

01:27:34.754 --> 01:27:37.006
When I go and get your meat
every morning!

01:27:37.089 --> 01:27:39.592
You forgot that?
And then I even give you my sister too!

01:27:39.675 --> 01:27:42.303
- Only a pig would say that!
- I'm a pig?

01:27:43.054 --> 01:27:45.056
A pig gets you the best?

01:27:45.848 --> 01:27:49.060
You're such a loser!
I don't get married because of you!

01:27:49.435 --> 01:27:51.562
You can't live by yourself!

01:27:51.979 --> 01:27:55.650
I put you two together,
and don't you forget it!

01:27:55.733 --> 01:27:57.109
You owe me!

01:27:59.612 --> 01:28:01.739
- You owe me!
- What do I owe you?

01:28:01.823 --> 01:28:04.242
You're supposed to be good to me!

01:28:04.325 --> 01:28:07.870
What do I owe you, Paulie?

01:28:07.954 --> 01:28:09.539
I treat you good!

01:28:09.622 --> 01:28:13.042
I cook for you, I clean for you,
I pick up your dirty clothes!

01:28:13.125 --> 01:28:16.379
I take care of you, Paulie!
I don't owe you nothing!

01:28:17.129 --> 01:28:19.590
And you made me feel like a loser!

01:28:20.716 --> 01:28:22.426
I'm not a loser!

01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:24.345
- You're busted!
- What?

01:28:24.428 --> 01:28:26.222
You're not a virgin!

01:28:26.639 --> 01:28:28.933
You let a man take down your pants!

01:28:29.016 --> 01:28:30.476
She's busted!

01:28:33.563 --> 01:28:35.648
I can't haul meat no more!

01:29:06.095 --> 01:29:07.889
You want a roommate?

01:29:12.852 --> 01:29:14.187
Absolutely.

01:29:16.063 --> 01:29:18.357
Okay, now when you walk into the ring

01:29:18.441 --> 01:29:21.194
with the number one
heavyweight of the world

01:29:21.277 --> 01:29:22.945
you'll be ready, won't you?

01:29:23.029 --> 01:29:26.449
Why? Because I waited for 50 years

01:29:26.532 --> 01:29:28.159
to make you ready.

01:29:28.242 --> 01:29:30.661
You'll be able to spit nails, kid!

01:29:30.745 --> 01:29:33.372
Like the guy says,
you're gonna eat lightning

01:29:33.456 --> 01:29:35.333
and you're gonna crap thunder!

01:29:35.416 --> 01:29:38.169
You're gonna become
a very dangerous person.

01:29:38.252 --> 01:29:39.545
Yo, Mickey.

01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:41.714
Hey, how are you? Oh, Rock.

01:29:41.798 --> 01:29:44.884
I want you to meet our cut man here.
Al Salvani.

01:29:44.967 --> 01:29:46.969
- Take a look at his eye.
- How you doing, Al?

01:29:47.053 --> 01:29:49.472
- That's right.
- It ain't bad. Seen worse.

01:29:49.555 --> 01:29:52.350
- You ain't so bad yourself.
- Cover up. Things will be okay.

01:29:52.433 --> 01:29:53.643
You cover up.

01:29:53.726 --> 01:29:55.478
Go and take a shower.

01:29:55.561 --> 01:29:57.980
Okay, Mick. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:29:58.981 --> 01:30:02.109
You covered that Whitmore fight?

01:30:02.193 --> 01:30:04.946
- That's why he won.
- Listen. We got a winner here.

01:30:05.029 --> 01:30:09.075
We got a chance. He goes to the body
like nobody you've ever seen.

01:30:09.158 --> 01:30:11.994
You just stand by. We're gonna win.

01:30:19.001 --> 01:30:21.504
Hey, Rock. It's okay I talk to you?

01:30:22.088 --> 01:30:24.841
Okay you talk to me? Sure.

01:30:25.633 --> 01:30:28.511
I figured some angle
to make some money off your name.

01:30:28.594 --> 01:30:31.222
My name? How's that?

01:30:31.389 --> 01:30:34.016
Advertising. I know about that stuff.

01:30:35.852 --> 01:30:38.354
What do you know about advertising?

01:30:41.649 --> 01:30:44.569
Hey, you can make money off my name,
make it, okay?

01:30:44.652 --> 01:30:46.654
I'm gonna take a shower.

01:30:47.613 --> 01:30:50.158
- Wanna help me off with these?
- Sure.

01:32:25.461 --> 01:32:27.338
You're gonna kill him!

01:35:18.217 --> 01:35:21.721
Rocky. What brings you here tonight?

01:35:23.306 --> 01:35:25.266
Mr. Jergens, the poster's wrong.

01:35:25.808 --> 01:35:27.477
What do you mean?

01:35:27.643 --> 01:35:30.480
I'm wearing white pants with a red stripe.

01:35:34.317 --> 01:35:36.736
It doesn't really matter, does it?

01:35:36.819 --> 01:35:39.655
I'm sure you're gonna give us
a great show.

01:35:40.656 --> 01:35:42.742
Try to get some rest, kid.

01:35:43.576 --> 01:35:44.952
Good night.

01:37:16.294 --> 01:37:17.837
I can't do it.

01:37:20.923 --> 01:37:22.008
What?

01:37:23.134 --> 01:37:24.760
I can't beat him.

01:37:26.345 --> 01:37:27.597
Apollo?

01:37:28.306 --> 01:37:29.474
Yeah.

01:37:30.892 --> 01:37:33.811
I been out there, walking around, thinking.

01:37:35.730 --> 01:37:38.983
Who am I kidding?
I ain't even in the guy's league.

01:37:44.363 --> 01:37:46.199
What are we gonna do?

01:37:57.794 --> 01:37:59.212
I don't know.

01:38:05.593 --> 01:38:07.345
You worked so hard.

01:38:09.222 --> 01:38:12.433
Yeah, it don't matter,
'cause I was nobody before.

01:38:14.769 --> 01:38:16.354
Don't say that.

01:38:17.063 --> 01:38:19.357
Oh, come on, Adrian. It's true.

01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.942
I was nobody.

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:25.530
But that don't matter either, you know?

01:38:26.572 --> 01:38:28.491
'Cause I was thinking,

01:38:29.742 --> 01:38:32.662
it really don't matter if I lose this fight.

01:38:34.747 --> 01:38:38.334
It really don't matter
if this guy opens my head either.

01:38:39.627 --> 01:38:42.421
'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance.

01:38:47.343 --> 01:38:50.221
Nobody's ever gone the distance
with Creed,

01:38:51.055 --> 01:38:53.307
and if I can go that distance,

01:38:54.725 --> 01:38:57.728
and that bell rings, and I'm still standing,

01:39:03.025 --> 01:39:06.362
I'm gonna know
for the first time in my life, see,

01:39:08.239 --> 01:39:11.742
that I weren't just another bum
from the neighborhood.

01:40:19.227 --> 01:40:21.020
Time, kid. Let's go.

01:40:24.065 --> 01:40:25.983
I'll wait for you here.

01:40:28.319 --> 01:40:31.113
How about I wait here and you fight, huh?

01:40:31.989 --> 01:40:35.076
You're looking very great today,
you know that?

01:40:37.078 --> 01:40:40.164
I gotta go now,
but don't you leave town, huh?

01:40:41.582 --> 01:40:43.960
Wish me luck. I'm gonna need it.

01:40:44.710 --> 01:40:46.045
Good luck.

01:40:46.838 --> 01:40:50.133
Adrian, you don't think
this robe is too baggy, huh?

01:40:50.341 --> 01:40:51.676
Good luck.

01:40:51.759 --> 01:40:53.386
Don't leave town.

01:40:55.763 --> 01:40:59.392
<i>I'd like you to meet my colleague,</i>
<i>Stu Nahan.</i>

01:40:59.475 --> 01:41:00.852
<i>Thank you, Bill Baldwin.</i>

01:41:00.935 --> 01:41:03.688
<i>The electricity is all over the place tonight,</i>
<i>as Rocky Balboa...</i>

01:41:05.606 --> 01:41:07.441
What is that?

01:41:07.525 --> 01:41:09.861
I trained you to be a fighter,
not a billboard.

01:41:09.944 --> 01:41:12.530
- I'm doing it for a friend.
- What do you get out of it?

01:41:12.613 --> 01:41:14.532
Paulie gets $3,000. I get the robe.

01:41:14.615 --> 01:41:15.825
Shrewd.

01:41:16.409 --> 01:41:19.078
<i>The story about tonight's fight,</i>
<i>their difference in style,</i>

01:41:19.162 --> 01:41:21.414
<i>you can quote</i>
<i>a recent sports magazine which said,</i>

01:41:21.497 --> 01:41:23.541
<i>it could be</i>
<i>"the caveman against the cavalier."</i>

01:41:23.624 --> 01:41:25.543
<i>I notice a buzzing in the background.</i>

01:41:25.626 --> 01:41:28.212
<i>Could be the challenger</i>
<i>is getting ready to get into the ring.</i>

01:41:28.296 --> 01:41:30.465
Rocky, look at my date.

01:41:30.548 --> 01:41:32.550
- Cost me $200.
- $250.

01:41:32.633 --> 01:41:34.302
I gotta go. I gotta work.

01:41:34.385 --> 01:41:36.721
- How's the robe?
- A little baggy.

01:41:36.804 --> 01:41:39.724
<i>A 50-to-1 underdog</i>
<i>living a Cinderella story,</i>

01:41:39.807 --> 01:41:43.519
<i>and he's captured people's imaginations</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

01:41:48.065 --> 01:41:49.817
We love you, Rocky!

01:41:50.151 --> 01:41:52.987
- Good luck, champ.
- Thanks for showing up.

01:41:53.488 --> 01:41:55.406
<i>And his record, 44 victories.</i>

01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:58.075
<i>He's had 38 by knockout,</i>
<i>and he's lost 20 fights.</i>

01:41:58.159 --> 01:42:00.536
<i>Which makes me wonder, can he stand it?</i>

01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:03.247
<i>You know, the stamina and the skill</i>
<i>to last three rounds.</i>

01:42:03.331 --> 01:42:05.291
<i>Because Las Vegas odds say no.</i>

01:42:05.374 --> 01:42:08.211
<i>Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring now.</i>

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.421
<i>"The Italian Stallion."</i>

01:42:10.505 --> 01:42:14.425
<i>Some meat sign on the back of his robe.</i>
<i>You seen what that was?</i>

01:42:14.509 --> 01:42:16.511
<i>Shamrock Meat...</i>

01:42:16.594 --> 01:42:19.764
<i>There's a lot of noise</i>
<i>coming from the background.</i>

01:42:20.264 --> 01:42:22.934
<i>- They have spotlights.</i>
<i>- Am I seeing right back there?</i>

01:42:23.017 --> 01:42:26.479
<i>Is that the world heavyweight champion,</i>
<i>Apollo Creed?</i>

01:42:26.562 --> 01:42:30.608
<i>He's riding in a boat.</i>
<i>Is he supposed to be George Washington?</i>

01:42:30.691 --> 01:42:33.945
<i>Obviously so.</i>
<i>He's got the hat on, the whole thing.</i>

01:42:35.446 --> 01:42:38.032
<i>The world champion, Apollo Creed</i>

01:42:38.115 --> 01:42:40.952
<i>is doing an imitation</i>
<i>of George Washington.</i>

01:42:41.911 --> 01:42:43.621
<i>He's throwing money.</i>

01:42:43.704 --> 01:42:47.125
<i>Remember when we were growing up,</i>
<i>we were taught about George Washington</i>

01:42:47.208 --> 01:42:48.626
<i>throwing a dollar.</i>

01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:51.462
<i>If you threw a dollar in those days,</i>
<i>it went a lot farther.</i>

01:42:51.546 --> 01:42:54.257
<i>Now he's taking his...</i>
<i>Blonde wig came off.</i>

01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.967
<i>The hat came off.</i>

01:42:57.301 --> 01:42:58.719
I want you!

01:42:59.971 --> 01:43:02.473
<i>The crowd is loving every minute of it.</i>

01:43:02.557 --> 01:43:05.601
<i>- Here is the world heavyweight champion.</i>
<i>- Apollo Creed.</i>

01:43:05.685 --> 01:43:07.103
<i>For you around the world</i>

01:43:07.186 --> 01:43:10.106
<i>he was dressed as George Washington,</i>
<i>the father of our country.</i>

01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:11.566
I want you!

01:43:14.318 --> 01:43:17.822
<i>I don't believe what I'm seeing.</i>
<i>Uncle Sam himself!</i>

01:43:17.905 --> 01:43:19.448
I want you!

01:43:19.532 --> 01:43:22.368
I want all of you!

01:43:22.952 --> 01:43:24.829
He looks like a big flag.

01:43:24.912 --> 01:43:26.956
I want you!

01:43:28.124 --> 01:43:30.418
- Is he talking to me?
- He's talking to you.

01:43:30.501 --> 01:43:32.670
- Is he talking to me?
- Let him talk.

01:43:32.753 --> 01:43:34.547
I want the Stallion!

01:43:35.214 --> 01:43:37.508
<i>He says, "I want the Stallion."</i>

01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:42.013
<i>For you in foreign countries,</i>

<i>the picture of Uncle Sam</i>

01:43:45.099 --> 01:43:47.518
<i>was a recruiting poster</i>
<i>for our fellows in the service,</i>

<i>the army and the navy. "I want you."</i>

01:43:49.896 --> 01:43:51.981
<i>That's what he's doing a take on.</i>

01:43:52.064 --> 01:43:55.318
<i>He's yelling, "Creed in three."</i>

01:43:55.401 --> 01:43:57.528
What do you think that outfit cost?

01:44:07.914 --> 01:44:10.082
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

Don't hurt him, okay?

01:45:01.968 --> 01:45:03.594
I'll try not to.

01:45:03.678 --> 01:45:06.055
<i>What a credit he's been</i>
<i>in his career as a fighter.</i>

01:45:06.139 --> 01:45:08.266
<i>Now he's coming over</i>
<i>to talk to the champ.</i>

01:45:08.349 --> 01:45:10.768
- Hey, Joe.
- You been ducking me a long time.

01:45:10.852 --> 01:45:12.520
No, Joe. You're next.

01:45:12.603 --> 01:45:14.814
- You're next.
- You understand?

01:45:15.356 --> 01:45:16.941
They must be friends.

Joe Frazier!

<i>- Fight fans, get settled down.</i>
- Go home!

01:45:29.537 --> 01:45:32.665
- Don't stay in the arena!
<i>- It won't be long now.</i>

01:45:34.125 --> 01:45:37.587
<i>Now for the main event.</i>

01:45:41.299 --> 01:45:42.925

You've both fought in Philadelphia before.
You know the rules.

01:46:37.438 --> 01:46:40.566
No low blows,
watch your heads, no butting.

01:46:40.650 --> 01:46:42.401
Shake hands and come out fighting.

01:46:42.485 --> 01:46:44.153
Put your hands up there, chump.

01:46:44.237 --> 01:46:46.364

<i>zipping in those left-handed jabs.</i>

01:47:22.942 --> 01:47:24.861
<i>Right there. Bang.</i>

01:47:26.487 --> 01:47:29.699
<i>The champ stinging the slower challenger</i>
<i>with jabs at will.</i>

01:47:29.782 --> 01:47:33.744
<i>In fact, it looks like Rocky</i>
<i>is blocking the blows with his face.</i>

01:47:33.828 --> 01:47:38.249
<i>The champion doesn't look the best</i>
<i>he's ever been, but he's moving now.</i>

01:47:38.332 --> 01:47:42.253
<i>The champion's smiling now.</i>
<i>He's toying with him.</i>

01:47:43.087 --> 01:47:46.007
<i>Trying to give the fans</i>
<i>their money's worth.</i>

01:47:47.675 --> 01:47:51.137
<i>He's very clearly outclassed</i>
<i>the challenger right now.</i>

01:47:53.306 --> 01:47:57.268
<i>He's trying to make his man miss like that.</i>

01:47:58.769 --> 01:48:01.397
<i>The champ is just taunting him.</i>

01:48:04.275 --> 01:48:06.110
<i>Creed dancing around.</i>

01:48:07.528 --> 01:48:09.363
<i>I don't believe this!</i>

01:48:09.447 --> 01:48:11.824
<i>The champ is down!</i>

01:48:17.955 --> 01:48:19.165
<i>Creed is down!</i>

01:48:19.248 --> 01:48:21.209
<i>What a surprise this is!</i>

01:48:22.376 --> 01:48:25.713
<i>This is the first time the champion</i>
<i>has ever been knocked down.</i>

01:48:25.797 --> 01:48:28.007
<i>The referee is giving him the count.</i>

01:48:28.090 --> 01:48:30.927
Six, seven, eight.

01:48:31.010 --> 01:48:33.888
<i>He appears to be all right.</i>
<i>Glassy-eyed but okay.</i>

01:48:34.263 --> 01:48:37.475
Go to the ribs! Go to work, Rock!

01:48:37.558 --> 01:48:39.060
Come on!

01:48:40.353 --> 01:48:43.564
<i>Rocky coming back out,</i>
<i>and he's like a bull in a china closet.</i>

01:48:43.648 --> 01:48:46.567
<i>He really wants it. Apollo, left to the head.</i>

01:48:46.692 --> 01:48:50.363
<i>The champion's coming off the floor</i>

01:48:50.446 --> 01:48:52.532
<i>and he's trying to put him away.</i>

01:48:52.615 --> 01:48:54.158
<i>A left, a right.</i>

01:48:54.242 --> 01:48:57.703
<i>Combinations into the face!</i>
<i>That's the Apollo we know.</i>

01:49:01.791 --> 01:49:05.169
<i>Now the champ is taunting Rocky</i>
<i>to come and get some more.</i>

01:49:05.253 --> 01:49:06.879
<i>A left. Another.</i>

01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:08.881
<i>Another left.</i>

01:49:10.341 --> 01:49:12.135
<i>Rocky's coming back!</i>

01:49:13.594 --> 01:49:16.514
<i>Rocky's got him on the ropes!</i>

01:49:17.306 --> 01:49:18.808
Let's break it.

01:49:20.309 --> 01:49:21.853
You're holding.

01:49:21.936 --> 01:49:23.729
You're posing as a boxer.

01:49:23.813 --> 01:49:26.899
<i>There's no way we expected</i>
<i>this kind of hitting.</i>

01:49:29.986 --> 01:49:32.071
Do your best. Do your best.

01:49:34.448 --> 01:49:38.202
<i>Apollo unloading a left.</i>
<i>He's got him up against the ropes.</i>

01:49:45.918 --> 01:49:50.047
<i>They're leading him to his corner.</i>
<i>Rocky can't find his way.</i>

01:49:50.756 --> 01:49:52.133
I called it!

01:49:52.216 --> 01:49:54.760
- Your nose is broke.
- How's it look?

01:49:54.844 --> 01:49:56.345
It's an improvement.

01:49:56.429 --> 01:49:59.682
Quit shucking and jiving! Stick and move!

01:49:59.765 --> 01:50:03.269
Go for the ribs.
Don't let that bastard breathe.

01:50:03.352 --> 01:50:04.770
The guy's quick.

01:50:04.854 --> 01:50:08.649
He doesn't know it's a damn show.
He thinks it's a damn fight.

01:50:08.733 --> 01:50:11.444
Finish this bum, and let's go home.

01:50:12.445 --> 01:50:14.822
Stay to the body. You're doing great!

01:50:14.906 --> 01:50:18.117
<i>Round two.</i>
<i>Creed predicted he'd win in it in three.</i>

01:50:18.201 --> 01:50:21.788
<i>Creed got knocked down in the first.</i>
<i>He came back strong.</i>

01:50:22.121 --> 01:50:23.790
<i>He's working now.</i>

01:50:24.207 --> 01:50:26.959
<i>A sharp left. Again, a hard right.</i>

01:50:27.043 --> 01:50:29.545
<i>Now coming in.</i>
<i>He's knocked him into the corner again.</i>

01:50:29.629 --> 01:50:32.131
<i>The champion's got him</i>
<i>backed into the corner.</i>

01:50:32.215 --> 01:50:36.135
<i>Pummeling him left and right,</i>
<i>his head bouncing against the ropes.</i>

01:50:37.011 --> 01:50:40.097
<i>Balboa 's taking</i>
<i>a tremendous beating here.</i>

01:50:40.181 --> 01:50:43.768
<i>Battering him like a punching bag.</i>
<i>What's keeping him up?</i>

01:50:46.103 --> 01:50:47.563
Can't you fight?

01:50:47.647 --> 01:50:50.900
Stop clowning around
and give the people something!

01:50:51.567 --> 01:50:53.903
- Come on!
<i>- He says he wants more!</i>

01:50:53.986 --> 01:50:56.781
<i>He wants more. You folks</i>
<i>watching television around the world</i>

01:50:56.864 --> 01:50:58.908
<i>you're watching a battle.</i>

01:51:03.663 --> 01:51:06.999
<i>Balboa trying to fight back.</i>
<i>Oh, he tagged the champ!</i>

01:51:07.083 --> 01:51:10.586
<i>The champion is trying to get out of there,</i>
<i>but he can't do it.</i>

01:51:10.670 --> 01:51:14.549
<i>He is being barraged with lefts and rights</i>
<i>to the head and body.</i>

01:51:14.632 --> 01:51:17.927
<i>Balboa is tagging the champion</i>
<i>right on the kisser!</i>

01:51:18.928 --> 01:51:22.181
<i>The referee steps in.</i>
<i>They're ready to keep going.</i>

01:51:22.723 --> 01:51:24.559
Back to your corners!

01:51:25.184 --> 01:51:27.103
Come on, Creed!

01:51:27.854 --> 01:51:30.106
<i>This is gonna be a tough one.</i>

01:52:24.744 --> 01:52:27.079
<i>- Back with a left!</i>
<i>- He got tagged!</i>

01:52:28.706 --> 01:52:31.250
<i>The referee's wiping off the gloves.</i>

01:52:36.464 --> 01:52:38.800
<i>Hard left and right combination!</i>

01:52:38.883 --> 01:52:41.803
<i>- What is keeping him up, Bill?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

01:52:43.763 --> 01:52:47.058
<i>He can't even get his gloves up</i>
<i>to protect himself.</i>

01:52:54.482 --> 01:52:56.567
Down! Stay down!

01:52:56.651 --> 01:52:58.945
<i>Apollo has his arms in the air!</i>

01:53:09.997 --> 01:53:11.124
Five.

01:53:12.416 --> 01:53:13.501
Six.

01:53:14.085 --> 01:53:15.294
Seven.

01:53:15.378 --> 01:53:16.546
Eight.

01:53:16.963 --> 01:53:18.047
Nine.

01:53:24.929 --> 01:53:26.180
Come on!

01:53:27.473 --> 01:53:29.475
<i>Apollo can't believe it.</i>

01:53:46.242 --> 01:53:49.454
<i>The champion got a left to his right ribs.</i>

01:53:49.829 --> 01:53:52.039
<i>This has been a tremendous...</i>

01:53:57.837 --> 01:53:59.005
Okay, champ?

01:53:59.088 --> 01:54:00.381
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:54:00.465 --> 01:54:03.092
I may have broke my ribs.

01:54:03.176 --> 01:54:05.636
I can't see nothing. Gotta open my eye.

01:54:05.720 --> 01:54:07.638
- Cut me.
- Don't wanna do it.

01:54:07.722 --> 01:54:10.224
- Go ahead. Cut me.
- Okay.

01:54:10.308 --> 01:54:11.851
Try it. Cut it.

01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:14.187
Creed! Creed!

01:54:16.147 --> 01:54:17.356
Oh, God.

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:20.234
You're bleeding inside.
I'm gonna stop the fight.

01:54:20.318 --> 01:54:23.613
You ain't stopping nothing, man.

01:54:23.821 --> 01:54:26.282
You stop this fight, I'll kill you!

01:54:27.658 --> 01:54:29.827
- I'm going.
- If you wanna go.

01:54:31.037 --> 01:54:33.372
You gotta give it all!

01:54:33.498 --> 01:54:35.416
You gotta get him!

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.840
<i>The 15th and final round.</i>

01:54:42.924 --> 01:54:45.927
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

01:54:51.766 --> 01:54:54.393
<i>They look like they've been in a war.</i>

01:55:02.026 --> 01:55:05.404
<i>A hard right.</i>
<i>The champion really tagged him.</i>

01:55:05.488 --> 01:55:09.450
<i>Apollo clearly protecting</i>
<i>his right side, his ribs.</i>

01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:14.664
<i>Body punches!</i>

01:55:14.747 --> 01:55:18.167
<i>Hard lefts and rights. Look at the blood</i>
<i>coming out of his mouth!</i>

01:55:18.251 --> 01:55:20.378
<i>He's spitting up blood now.</i>

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.342
<i>A tremendous right hand by Rocky.</i>

01:55:26.425 --> 01:55:27.802
Go for it, Rock!

01:55:27.885 --> 01:55:30.930
<i>- Listen to this crowd!</i>
<i>- Right to the ribs.</i>

01:55:31.013 --> 01:55:33.307
<i>Another to the ribs. That left hand again.</i>

01:55:33.391 --> 01:55:36.644
<i>Right to the jaw!</i>
<i>He's got him up against the ropes!</i>

01:55:36.727 --> 01:55:38.813
<i>Apollo the champ...</i>

01:55:42.275 --> 01:55:45.027
Ain't gonna be no rematch.

01:55:45.653 --> 01:55:47.196
Don't want one.

01:55:57.707 --> 01:56:00.668
Rocky, you went the distance, 15 rounds.
How do you feel?

01:56:00.751 --> 01:56:03.254
- All right.
- What were you thinking about...

01:56:03.337 --> 01:56:05.965
- Adrian!
...coming out for the 15th round?

01:56:06.048 --> 01:56:07.300
Adrian!

01:56:09.302 --> 01:56:10.470
Rocky!

01:56:14.807 --> 01:56:16.642
<i>- Tonight...</i>
- Rocky!

01:56:16.726 --> 01:56:19.770
<i>... we have had the privilege of witnessing</i>

01:56:19.854 --> 01:56:23.483
<i>the greatest exhibition of boxing stamina</i>

01:56:23.566 --> 01:56:25.651
<i>in the history of the ring.</i>

01:56:25.735 --> 01:56:27.320
Adrian!

01:56:28.112 --> 01:56:29.322
Rocky!

01:56:30.156 --> 01:56:32.283
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:56:32.366 --> 01:56:35.161
<i>we have a split decision.</i>

01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:37.830
<i>Judge Walker</i>

01:56:41.292 --> 01:56:42.668
<i>for Creed!</i>

01:56:45.338 --> 01:56:46.506
Adrian!

01:56:46.631 --> 01:56:50.134
- Your fans want a rematch.
- Ain't gonna be no rematch!

01:56:51.928 --> 01:56:53.679
- Adrian!
- You heard him...

01:56:53.763 --> 01:56:56.891
- You can't go in there!
- That's my friend. Let go!

01:56:56.974 --> 01:56:59.477
- You're wrecking the jacket!
- Rocky!

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:02.188
- Paulie.
- Adrian!

01:57:03.898 --> 01:57:06.234
- Adrian! Where's your hat?
- Rocky!

01:57:06.317 --> 01:57:07.568
I love you!

01:57:07.652 --> 01:57:09.028
I love you!

01:57:12.698 --> 01:57:15.201

- I love you!

01:57:15.284 --> 01:57:16.869
I love you!
