WEBVTT

00:06.423 --> 00:10.843
To all your friends,
you're delirious

00:11.095 --> 00:16.057
So consumed in all your doom

00:18.018 --> 00:22.980
Trying hard
to fill your emptiness

00:23.816 --> 00:26.651
The piece is gone

00:26.777 --> 00:28.403
Ten-minute warning.
I'm fine.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.030
- What about your meds?
- Got it, Mom.

00:32.032 --> 00:36.703
You are beautiful
no matter what they say

01:49.234 --> 01:50.485
House!

01:51.445 --> 01:54.781
- Need you.
- Forget it. I'm going home.

01:54.907 --> 01:58.326
- Hay fever?
- You must be a doctor and everything.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.660
- Two minutes.
- No.

01:59.787 --> 02:03.706
The purple thingie on the file means
that whoever is one of yours

02:03.832 --> 02:06.292
which means cancer,
which means no way it's two minutes.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.503
Fine, I'm lying.
30 minutes.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.095
- Mystery of life.
- Benadryl might help.

02:18.222 --> 02:22.266
- Already did 1,000 milligrams.
- Steam room?

02:23.560 --> 02:26.395
Why, Jimmy. We'll talk about this
in the morning.

02:26.522 --> 02:30.358
I got a 9-year-old with cancer.
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.820
- Terminal kid trumps your stuffy nose.
- Not yet.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.655
She's hallucinating.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.574
So the rhabdo's in her brain.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.576
Make her comfortable.
She's got about a week.

02:40.702 --> 02:44.163
Yeah, except there is
no cancer in her brain.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.375
Pristine CT scan, blood tests,
protein markers, all negative.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.502
The cancer's in remission.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.381
Which means
the hallucinations
are unconnected.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.383
Fascinating, huh?

02:55.509 --> 02:58.386
And not that it matters,
but if you fix whatever's
going on in her head,

02:58.512 --> 03:02.515
you give her
maybe another year.
Long time for a 9-year-old.

03:04.268 --> 03:07.353
No. It'll just fly by.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.524
Five major surgeries,
a bone marrow transplant,

03:11.650 --> 03:13.568
fourteen rounds of chemo
and blast radiation.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.487
If it was me, I'd just stay home
and watch TV or something,

03:16.613 --> 03:18.364
not lie here
under a microscope.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.996
Don't worry. Anything happens to you,
nobody's gonna lift a finger.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.291
Differential diagnosis.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.377
- On your marks, get set...
- Hallucinations could be caused by...

03:31.503 --> 03:34.505
Whoa! Wait for it.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.258
And go.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.511
...latent neurotoxicity
from the chemo treatments.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.972
No, patient's last round
of chemo was two months ago.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.807
We would've seen it by now.
Genetic component?

03:44.933 --> 03:48.394
Nothing on mom.
Dad split
when she was pregnant.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.647
- His medical history's also clean.
- What a guy.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.359
What about graft versus host disease
from the bone marrow transplant?

03:55.485 --> 03:58.362
Infection travels to her brain,
she has hallucinations.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.614
Blood work and LP were clean.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.950
But where there's infection,
there's meningeal swelling.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.370
- CT shows no meningeal involvement.
- True.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.372
Get a tox screen and an MRI.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.875
We can do that, if you wanna ignore
what we just discussed.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.043
Sounds good.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.337
Toxic exposure doesn't make
any chronological sense.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.631
I guess there is a third option.
She's making it all up

04:16.757 --> 04:19.383
because she doesn't
wanna get in trouble
for breaking a mirror.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.846
Unfortunately
we can't test for that,
so tox screen, MRI,

04:24.514 --> 04:26.849
- and you stay away from the patient.
- What'd I do?

04:26.975 --> 04:30.978
Oh, well, you'll just get
all warm and cuddly
around the dying girl,

04:31.104 --> 04:34.815
and insinuate yourself.
Probably end up
in a custody battle.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.192
Chase, you handle the mom.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.569
Tell her that you'd just sit home
and watch TV and die,

04:38.695 --> 04:40.154
but you've got
to go through the motions

04:40.280 --> 04:43.491
and try to save
her daughter's life.
It's a doctor thing.

04:45.327 --> 04:49.497
- What the hell is this?
- Black walnut and ginger.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.500
It's nice.

04:52.626 --> 04:56.379
I'll just lay you down
and I'll attach
this thingamajiggy.

04:56.505 --> 05:00.424
- Sat monitor.
- A pro. Don't have to explain anything.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.635
I like it.

05:07.808 --> 05:11.394
- Central line for the chemo.
- Yeah. Doesn't hurt, does it?

05:11.520 --> 05:12.395
No, it's awesome.

05:12.521 --> 05:16.482
Instead of an IV, it saves me a lot
of time and a bunch of needle sticks.

05:16.608 --> 05:20.820
Oh, I don't think I've ever heard anyone
say they like their central line before.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.991
All right, can I interest you
in a walk in the park?

05:26.576 --> 05:28.160
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.706
Don't want
any butterflies, either.

05:31.832 --> 05:35.543
Doesn't matter what the walls
look like, you're still
looking for cancer.

05:35.669 --> 05:39.505
Not today. We're looking
for an infection.
But I get your point.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.132
- You comfortable?
- Yup.

05:41.258 --> 05:46.345
- All right. Let's get this over with.
- A pro. I like it.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.308
Whoa! Look at the time.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.144
I should've been out of here
20 minutes ago.

05:53.270 --> 05:57.314
- You've only been here 20 minutes.
- I can't slip anything by you, can I?

05:57.441 --> 05:59.734
- There's a patient in One.
- Nah, I'm taking a sick day.

05:59.860 --> 06:03.237
- Take some Claritin.
- Everyone's a doctor suddenly.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.698
Patient in One
requested a male doctor.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.117
- Balls are in your court, doctor.
- Union rules.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.537
I can't check out
this guy's seeping gonorrhea
this close to lunch.

06:11.663 --> 06:12.830
Exam Room One.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.709
Well, it's sexist, and
a very dangerous precedent.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.544
If people could choose
the sex of their doctors,

06:18.670 --> 06:21.255
- you gals would be out of business.
- Exam Room One!

06:25.635 --> 06:26.886
Sore throat?

06:31.641 --> 06:35.478
Well, it's not lupus.
Well, not everyone
can operate a zipper.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.481
You know, the up, down,
what comes next?

06:38.607 --> 06:41.901
My new girlfriend
never been with a guy

06:42.027 --> 06:44.445
who wasn't circumcised.

06:45.363 --> 06:47.531
- So she freaked, and...
- Ah-ha.

06:47.657 --> 06:51.702
And you wanted Rivkah
to feel all gemutlicht.
I get it.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.537
It's a shandah.

07:00.170 --> 07:04.131
- I got some box cutters and...
- Just like Abraham did it.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.843
I sterilized them,
which I was told...

07:07.969 --> 07:09.261
Stop talking.

07:11.098 --> 07:15.434
I'm gonna get a plastic
surgeon. Get the Twinkie
back in the wrapper.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.111
House. Hey, House.

07:26.321 --> 07:30.574
Andie's MRI
and tox screen were clean.
No infection, no neurotoxins.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.797
Oxygen saturation is 94%.
Check her heart.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.674
Her oxygen saturation
is normal.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.802
It's off
by one percentage point.
It's within range, it's normal.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.889
If her DNA was off
by one percentage point,
she'd be a dolphin.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.559
We've got a patient
who for no obvious reason
is hallucinating.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.145
Since it's not obvious,
I thought we'd go with subtle.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.522
It doesn't matter.
If her sat percentage is off,

08:01.648 --> 08:03.399
that means her blood
isn't getting enough oxygen.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.151
That's a problem
with her lungs, not her heart.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.944
And a lung problem
isn't causing hallucinations.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.946
But the lungs could
lead us somewhere that is.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.739
Welcome to the end
of the thought process.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.533
Primary pulmonary hypertension?

08:12.659 --> 08:14.535
Maybe PE
or pulmonary fibrosis.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.663
Could be some bizarre case
of kyphoscoliosis.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.874
I'm going home.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.877
While I'm resting, you guys
get some arterial blood gases,

08:23.003 --> 08:25.838
once you confirm
that she is hypoxic,
I want a plethysmography,

08:25.964 --> 08:28.007
chest x-ray, CT and V-Q.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.511
But if all that comes back
negative, then snake
a catheter into her lungs.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.807
Don't worry,
if I don't sleep in,
I'll get bagels.

08:37.934 --> 08:41.020
- You ever had this test before?
- What's it for?

08:42.439 --> 08:46.275
This goes
all the way up the vein
by your hip, into your lung.

08:46.401 --> 08:49.570
If I find something up there
blocking anything,
I pull it out. Simple.

08:49.696 --> 08:54.408
It's gonna be easy.
The doctor at Sloan told me
I had a great aorta.

08:54.534 --> 08:58.871
- Oh, you have had this test before.
- Sorry. I just like hearing you talk.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.963
I've never kissed a boy.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.259
There's time yet for that.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.679
There was a boy last summer.

09:16.723 --> 09:21.227
I was at one of those
cancer camps. I just never
had the guts to ask him.

09:24.648 --> 09:29.151
You know, there's
a good chance I'm not gonna
walk out of this hospital.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.111
Even if I do, I'm nine.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.031
Not a lot of kissing going on
in the third grade.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.952
You will walk
out of here, all right?
And you will kiss a boy.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.665
There you go. A smile.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.461
Will you kiss me?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.676
- No.
- No one will ever know.

09:55.553 --> 09:59.139
I'm sorry.
I can't.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.685
- I won't tell anyone.
- Listen, you're nine years old.

10:03.395 --> 10:04.812
I'm 30.

10:05.689 --> 10:09.275
I just wanna know
what it feels like. Once.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.778
This isn't
your last chance for that.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.614
What if it is?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.078
Please kiss me?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.989
- Bagels.
- You didn't sleep in.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.326
Didn't sleep, didn't breathe.
I'm dying.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.579
Pulmonary angiogram
of Andie's lungs was clean.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.999
Arterial blood gases
and CT scan were also normal.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.418
Her heart and lungs are fine.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.713
Which gives us no explanation
for the diminished
sat percentage.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.923
Yeah, oddly enough,
sometimes normal is normal.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.552
Sometimes we can't see
why normal isn't normal.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.805
Get her symptoms on the board.
You're letting me touch the markers?

11:21.931 --> 11:24.183
It's written out
in my advanced
health care directive.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.727
Should I be
incapacitated in any way,
you run the board.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.356
Then Foreman.
Chase, you're just
not ready yet.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.942
- What else?
- I know we sort of ruled out infection,

11:34.069 --> 11:36.737
but if we forget the labs
for a minute,

11:36.863 --> 11:39.698
there is one infection
we didn't test for
because of her age.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.700
- Neurosyphilis.
- There's no way.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.702
If the infection dipped into
her cerebral cortex,

11:43.828 --> 11:45.537
all peripheral functions
could be compromised.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.040
No. She hasn't had sex.
She's nine.

11:48.166 --> 11:52.419
Maybe it wasn't her idea.
I mean, she's been around
a lot of adults.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.381
All the hospital visits,
the counselors
at the cancer camps.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.715
You think
she's been molested?

11:56.841 --> 11:58.842
And hiding it pretty well
if there's any of that
going on.

11:58.968 --> 12:02.137
Yeah. All girls
who've been molested
wanna talk about it.

12:02.263 --> 12:05.224
- Break out the rape kit.
- She hasn't had sex.

12:05.350 --> 12:09.520
- Why are you so sure?
- She told me she'd never kissed a boy.

12:09.646 --> 12:13.857
- You read her diary, too?
- She asked me to kiss her.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.901
I rest my case.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.737
A regular 9-year-old girl
does not have sex
on the brain,

12:18.863 --> 12:21.198
not when a doctor's
threading a catheter
through her vein.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.826
But she's not
a regular 9-year-old.
She's got terminal cancer.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.286
Cancer doesn't
make you special.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.290
- Molestation on the other hand...
- She wanted one kiss, before she dies.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.253
If she's never kissed a boy,
it's a fair bet
she's never had sex.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.923
Tell that to all the hookers
who won't kiss me
on the mouth.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.717
Hey, here's a theory.
She has been molested,

12:40.844 --> 12:44.847
seeks refuge
in romantic fantasies with
older men with great hair,

12:44.973 --> 12:48.142
and I think
you left out the punchline.

12:48.268 --> 12:52.020
Victims of molestation
learn to work the angles,
manipulate people.

12:54.858 --> 12:58.068
You did it, didn't you?
You kissed her.

13:00.113 --> 13:04.658
It wasn't sick.
It was one kiss
for a dying girl.

13:04.784 --> 13:08.245
One small...
One small kiss
before she dies.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.413
Thank you. Thanks.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.708
This is exactly why
you can't touch my markers.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.085
- Go see if she's had sex.
- Okay.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.216
- No one's ever touched me.
- We just need to be sure.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.679
I like your hair.

13:26.764 --> 13:31.518
I used to have
really curly hair. I always
wanted it to be like yours is.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.023
Thank you.

13:36.691 --> 13:40.068
All right, that's it.
You're fine.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.855
- With a patient.
- She dying?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.858
- No.
- Then she can wait.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.738
Will you excuse me
just two minutes?

14:26.991 --> 14:31.286
If only she'd been molested.
Then we'd have
something to go on.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.872
- No forced entry.
- One hallucination.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.417
Maybe it was just bad pork,
maybe there's nothing...

14:37.544 --> 14:39.002
She's not fine.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.756
Her sat percentage
dropped another point.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.300
Which could suggest a tumor in her lung.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.177
Lung wouldn't explain
the hallucination.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.930
CT scans showed
both lungs were clean.

14:50.056 --> 14:53.850
- So there's a tumor in her heart.
- Not a chance! Give me that.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.813
- I loosened it.
- I opened it.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.275
We've got an MRI
and an echo of her heart.
There's nothing there.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.654
Give me one other explanation
for low oxygen saturation.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.740
I can't.
There's only one condition
that simultaneously affects

15:08.866 --> 15:11.702
- the heart and brain, but she...
- Perfect, let's go with that.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.747
Tuberous sclerosis in a kid
that also has
alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma?

15:15.873 --> 15:19.751
Two different unrelated
cancers at the same time
is a statistical no-no.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.504
What's the rate of cancer
in the general population?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.591
- One in 10,000?
- Don't. Don't start with the numbers.

15:25.717 --> 15:29.761
Way I figure it,
one in 10,000 of them
should have another cancer.

15:29.887 --> 15:32.139
Little girl
won the lottery twice.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.726
- It happens.
- So you're gonna cut her open?

15:35.852 --> 15:38.937
Exploratory surgery.
I gotta find this thing.

15:39.063 --> 15:42.482
You're just gonna grope around
inside an immunocompromised
9-year-old?

15:42.609 --> 15:45.152
- She could die on the table.
- I know it's somewhere near the heart.

15:45.278 --> 15:49.031
House... you've got to do
better than that.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.301
Why are we here?

16:13.139 --> 16:16.433
Better acoustics.
Now listen to this.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.858
- It's a mitral heart valve.
- No. Get the wax out of your ears.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.152
This is the patient's
aortic valve.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.155
I downloaded the audio
of her echocardiogram.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.574
- What are we trying to hear?
- Tumor.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.661
They tend to keep quiet
on account of them
not having any mouths.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.455
But we could hear
an abnormality
in the sound of the valve,

16:38.581 --> 16:40.832
which would indicate
the presence of something.

16:40.958 --> 16:45.295
The tumor, for example.
If we could tell the surgeon
where to look,

16:45.421 --> 16:48.674
this is no longer
an exploratory surgery,
it's a precision strike.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.677
- Her aortic valve sounds normal.
- Too bad.

16:51.803 --> 16:55.514
Now listen to the dulcet tones
of Andie's tricuspid valve.

16:58.059 --> 17:01.687
- Normal.
- And this is her mitral valve.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.776
I don't hear anything weird.

17:08.778 --> 17:12.322
You guys make me sad.
Listen again.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.784
She's had one hallucination.
Why are we operating on her?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.160
Why are we risking her life?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.663
Because Wilson thinks
it'd be nice
to give the girl a year

17:19.789 --> 17:22.124
to say goodbye to her mommy.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.752
Guess maybe she stutters
or something.
Now shut up and listen.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.254
Tricuspid.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.925
Mitral.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.513
- Again.
- Wait.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.474
There.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.686
There's an extra flap.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.899
I'm gonna ask
the surgeon to look
at the mitral valve first.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.109
Chase, I want you there.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.862
I don't like
reading surgeon's reports,
they're boring.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.656
I'm not really sure
I should be spending
more time with her.

17:54.782 --> 17:57.367
She'll be unconscious.
You'll be safe.

18:13.801 --> 18:17.471
- I'll be there when you wake up.
- I'm gonna be fine, Mom.

18:22.935 --> 18:26.688
Brave kid.
She even gave her mom
a pep talk.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.733
Mature, brave. She's a wonder.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.360
What's your problem?

18:32.487 --> 18:35.697
These cancer kids,
you can't put them all
on a pedestal.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.659
It's basic statistics.
Some of them have got to be
whiny little fraidy-cats.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.744
You're unbelievable.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.788
If there's not
one yellow-belly
in the whole group,

18:42.914 --> 18:45.373
then being brave
doesn't have any meaning.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.168
Andie handles
an impossible situation
with grace.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.377
That's not to be admired?

18:49.504 --> 18:50.837
You see grace
because you wanna see grace.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.215
You don't see grace
because you won't go
anywhere near her.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.675
Idolizing is
pathological with you people.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.886
You see things to admire
where there's nothing.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.554
Yeah, well, we're evil.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.057
You find things to admire
where you shouldn't
be sniffing at all.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.560
- Like Debbie in Accounting.
- She's nice.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.145
You shouldn't know that.
You're married.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.232
So, the little kid
dying of cancer,
I shouldn't like her?

19:10.358 --> 19:12.692
If you're dying,
suddenly everybody loves you.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.361
You have a cane, nobody even likes you.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.239
I'm not terminal, merely pathetic.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.158
You wouldn't believe the crap
people let me get away with.

20:12.336 --> 20:16.590
They found a tumor.
It's in her lung,
extending into her heart.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.468
It wasn't visible on the MRI
because it's growing
along the heart wall.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.220
Now, because of the placement,

20:22.346 --> 20:25.682
the surgeon
has to temporarily remove
Andie's heart.

20:25.808 --> 20:29.227
It's called an explant.
They cut out the tumor,

20:29.353 --> 20:32.731
replace any damaged
heart muscle
with bovine patches.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.651
That's a patch made
from the cow's pericardium.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.070
It's a sac
that encloses the heart.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.697
What are her chances?

20:40.823 --> 20:44.451
The problem is,
there might not be
enough heart left

20:44.577 --> 20:46.703
once they remove
all of the tumor.

20:47.622 --> 20:51.541
And if the tumor's
metastasized,
there's nothing we can do.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.981
- Dr. Murphy.
- Just let me tie this off.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.691
- Doctor!
- What?

21:16.817 --> 21:19.069
She's got a bleed in her eye.

21:24.408 --> 21:28.370
They got the tumor,
repaired her heart,
but she bled out of her eye.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.413
She didn't
bleed out of her eye
from a heart tumor.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.291
- True. The cardiac tumor was benign.
- That's impossible!

21:33.417 --> 21:35.293
- Statistically...
- Oh, shut up.

21:35.419 --> 21:38.964
If the tumor's benign,
that means it didn't cause
her hallucinations.

21:39.090 --> 21:42.842
- That's why I'm mentioning it.
- So, the tumor's a coincidence?

21:43.719 --> 21:46.054
This is bad.
You're starting
to state the obvious.

21:46.180 --> 21:49.766
No, you said it would be there
and it was there.
It can't be a coincidence.

21:49.892 --> 21:52.102
A 9-year-old
with terminal cancer

21:52.228 --> 21:54.729
gets an unrelated benign tumor
growing in her heart.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.273
- Why?
- It's benign? That's impossible.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.526
- Talk to Wilson.
- The retinal bleed, also coincidence?

21:59.652 --> 22:02.195
A clot could create pressure
behind the eye,
cause the bleeding.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.823
A clot could explain the eye,
but doesn't explain
the hallucinations.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.116
A clot could cause
mini seizures.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.284
Great. Another thing
that's not causing
the hallucinations.

22:08.411 --> 22:09.411
Post-seizure
psychosis.

22:09.537 --> 22:12.288
The brain sort of
corrects itself after
the seizure by hallucinating.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.332
The clot
could explain the eye
and the hallucinations,

22:14.458 --> 22:15.500
but what about the tumor?

22:15.626 --> 22:18.294
Tumors the size of an octopus
wrapped around
a little girl's heart

22:18.421 --> 22:19.504
are not just a coincidence.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.297
She's not healthy,
she's never been healthy.

22:21.424 --> 22:23.633
What's the theory
here? This girl's body's
a lemon?

22:23.759 --> 22:26.428
Faulty manufacturing,
everything's falling apart?

22:27.430 --> 22:32.392
The tumor is Afghanistan,
the clot is Buffalo.

22:34.145 --> 22:37.147
Does that need
more explanation? Okay.

22:37.273 --> 22:40.233
The tumor is Al-Qaeda,
the big bad guy, the brains.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.278
We went in, wiped it out,
but it had already
sent out a splinter cell.

22:43.404 --> 22:47.532
A small team of low-level
terrorists quietly living
in some suburb of Buffalo,

22:47.658 --> 22:48.742
waiting to kill us all.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.912
Are you trying to say
the tumor threw a clot
before we removed it?

22:53.039 --> 22:55.373
It was an excellent metaphor.

22:55.499 --> 22:59.794
Angio her brain
before this clot
straps on an explosive vest.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.067
Angio was clean.

23:22.693 --> 23:26.696
- There's no clot?
- There is, we just can't find it.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.449
You can't do
exploratory surgery
on her brain.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.202
Are you sure
you're not a neurologist?

23:35.372 --> 23:36.414
Okay.

23:38.292 --> 23:41.628
- She's gonna die.
- The clot's not gonna go away quietly.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.380
It could blow at any time.

23:45.424 --> 23:49.427
- Are you gonna let them know?
- I guess so.

23:50.221 --> 23:53.765
- Can I come with?
- To tell Andie she's gonna die?

23:53.891 --> 23:57.644
- That's very un-you.
- She's such a brave girl.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.106
I wanna see how brave she is
when you tell her
she's gonna die.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.401
Go to hell.

24:33.931 --> 24:36.891
What would you do
if you were told
you were gonna die?

24:37.643 --> 24:41.312
- I don't know, I'd be devastated.
- You'd cry like a baby.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.314
Everybody would.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.067
She's not doing anything.
She's a rock.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.277
She's brave.

24:47.403 --> 24:48.903
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Why?

24:49.029 --> 24:51.281
She's gone through
more than most people do
in a lifetime.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.409
So what?
Does that mean
she's ready to die?

24:54.535 --> 24:57.370
What if her bravery
is a symptom?

24:57.496 --> 25:00.373
The clot is causing
hallucinations and messing
with her emotions.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.750
You think her bravery
is chemically based?

25:02.877 --> 25:05.753
It would tell us
where to look for the clot.
Where's the fear center?

25:05.880 --> 25:09.841
The amygdala, near the
hippocampus. It's a big area
and a busy one.

25:09.967 --> 25:12.886
You blindly cut in there,
you'll kill her.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.972
Only time you're gonna
see this clot is at autopsy.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.728
Then let's do that.

25:24.607 --> 25:27.901
Is it still illegal
to perform an autopsy
on a living person?

25:28.027 --> 25:31.279
- Are you high?
- If it's Tuesday, I'm wasted.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.822
It's Wednesday.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.491
I want to induce
a hypothermic cardiac arrest.

25:35.618 --> 25:38.786
Once the patient's on bypass,
we siphon off
two liters of blood,

25:38.913 --> 25:40.538
perfuse the brain
while she's in an MRI.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.248
You're actually
talking about killing her.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.292
Just for a little while.
I'll bring her right back.

25:44.418 --> 25:47.295
Oh, well, in that case,
go ahead. Why are we
even talking?

25:47.421 --> 25:50.506
If we do nothing,
she's dead in a day,
maybe a week.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.425
The kind that lasts.

25:55.179 --> 25:57.096
We need FDA approval
for any surgical technique

25:57.223 --> 25:59.140
- that's used for diagnostic purposes.
- Absolutely.

25:59.266 --> 26:02.435
If we were doing
anything invasive. But
there's nothing invasive...

26:05.439 --> 26:08.149
You know,
I'm not cutting into her head.
I'm just looking for a clot.

26:08.275 --> 26:11.527
Not invasive?
You're killing her.

26:11.654 --> 26:14.447
Don't split hairs.
If it works, she lives.

26:21.372 --> 26:25.375
Make sure the mom understands
that this is
a million-to-one shot.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.296
I'll see that Wilson
passes that along.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.465
The plan is

26:32.591 --> 26:36.261
basically
to reboot your daughter.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.765
Like a computer.
We shut her down.
Then restart her.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.352
How do you restart
a 9-year-old girl?

26:44.478 --> 26:47.814
We cool
her core body temperature
to 21 degree Celsius.

26:47.940 --> 26:52.318
- Use blankets, ice.
- Sort of like hibernation?

26:52.444 --> 26:55.947
Not quite. In hibernation,
a bear's heartbeat
is just very slow.

26:56.073 --> 26:58.950
In cardiac arrest,
there is no heartbeat.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.410
So she's dead.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.412
Temporarily, yes.

27:02.538 --> 27:07.625
By cooling her,
we limit the risk of damage
when we remove her blood.

27:07.751 --> 27:11.421
- Not all of it, two to three liters.
- Half her blood?

27:12.589 --> 27:16.426
Then we put it back.
It's called
perfusing the circuit.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.303
In this case, her brain.

27:18.429 --> 27:21.180
And using an MRI,
we'd have a very brief window

27:21.307 --> 27:24.058
to hopefully see
the outline of the clot.

27:26.020 --> 27:30.148
If it's there,
and it's operable,
we go get it.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.651
And Andie walks out of here.

27:48.459 --> 27:52.170
- Signed consent forms.
- Great, thanks.

27:52.963 --> 27:54.797
You sound better.

27:54.923 --> 27:58.551
I stacked a combo
of Mentholatum, a few Vicodin,

27:58.677 --> 28:01.596
and something else
which I can't remember.

28:01.722 --> 28:04.432
Should be able
to ride the high
for a couple hours.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.979
- What did Andie say?
- About what?

28:10.814 --> 28:13.441
- About this?
- I didn't talk to her.

28:14.401 --> 28:17.278
She doesn't need to know
the specifics
of this procedure.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.074
What if you're right
about her?

28:22.493 --> 28:25.328
What if
she just is that brave?

28:25.454 --> 28:28.456
That doesn't mean
she's mature enough to handle
this kind of decision.

28:28.582 --> 28:32.377
Either she understands,
or she's not brave.
You can't have it both ways.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.671
If she does understand,

28:36.924 --> 28:39.675
then she deserves to know
what's going on.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.791
- I'm Dr. House.
- I've seen you around.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.419
Your mom tell you
what we're gonna try?

29:14.545 --> 29:15.670
Sort of.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.846
Tomorrow's test
could take 10 hours.

29:26.181 --> 29:30.184
Given your present condition,
you might not even
make it through.

29:31.937 --> 29:35.648
- My mom's done a lot of research.
- How do you feel about it?

29:37.025 --> 29:40.486
If we figured maturity came
from how much time
you've got left

29:40.612 --> 29:43.656
instead of how long
you've been here,
this would be your call.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.993
I don't have a choice, right?

29:48.454 --> 29:50.455
I could give you one.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.168
I wanna get better.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.753
You've got cancer.

29:58.881 --> 30:00.882
- If I fix this...
- I have a year.

30:02.468 --> 30:03.885
A year of this.

30:05.762 --> 30:08.389
A lot of people
wouldn't want that.

30:09.766 --> 30:12.852
A lot of people
would just want it to be over.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.690
Are you asking if I wanna die?

30:17.816 --> 30:19.525
Nobody wants to die.

30:22.112 --> 30:23.779
But you're going to.

30:26.074 --> 30:30.036
The question is, how?
How much
you're gonna suffer, and

30:31.705 --> 30:33.456
how long.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.709
I'm asking
if you want this to be over.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.427
What would you tell my mom?

30:48.805 --> 30:51.182
I would give her
10 excellent medical reasons

30:51.308 --> 30:53.476
why we can't
do this procedure.

30:54.645 --> 30:57.438
I can't just leave her
'cause I'm tired.

31:01.735 --> 31:04.403
But you can't stay for her,
either.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.281
But she needs me here.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.286
This is your life.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.705
You can't do this
just for her.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.794
I love her.

31:29.930 --> 31:32.723
Thank you for joining me
for tonight's dress rehearsal.

31:32.849 --> 31:35.476
Playing the part of Andie
is Morty Randolph.

31:35.602 --> 31:38.354
For his donation to science,
we give our thanks.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.856
Once Andie is cooled
and goes off bypass,

31:40.983 --> 31:44.610
we have 60 seconds
to get two liters of blood
out of her body,

31:44.736 --> 31:47.822
back into her for the pictures
to find the clot in her head.

31:47.948 --> 31:50.825
If our star
is bumped tomorrow,

31:51.785 --> 31:56.080
while my MRI is on,
these red lights will go off.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.124
Which will mean we have
no usable test results.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.710
No test results,
it's goodbye Broadway.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.504
You guys'll be wearing
bad cat suits in Des Moines.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.840
We'll have neurosurgeons here
with a view of the monitors,

32:05.966 --> 32:07.967
cardiac surgeon there
in case we need
to open her up.

32:08.093 --> 32:11.095
Anesthesiologists, one by
the cardiac bypass machine,

32:11.221 --> 32:13.431
one by the cooling apparatus.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.058
Girls in the chorus,
if you're over 5'10",
stick with me.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.853
Okay, give me 60 seconds
on the clock.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.732
Show time.
A five, six, seven, eight!

32:23.900 --> 32:25.860
Siphon off the blood
through the arterial line.

32:26.653 --> 32:27.737
Whoosh.

32:27.863 --> 32:30.489
Sound of blood draining.
More whoosh.

32:32.826 --> 32:36.704
And we kill her.

32:36.830 --> 32:37.955
Again.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.710
Sorry, my hand
slipped.
How hard can this be?

32:42.836 --> 32:45.046
- It's a little busy down here.
- Again!

32:46.840 --> 32:48.716
If we didn't
have to lavage
her gastrointestinal...

32:48.842 --> 32:52.678
Again!

32:54.473 --> 32:56.557
We could bolt it to the table.

32:58.060 --> 33:01.562
Gruesome and low-tech.
Kiss me, I love it.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.523
A five, six, seven, eight!

33:07.277 --> 33:09.028
Here you go, Doctor.

33:11.281 --> 33:13.199
This'll make you sleep.

33:14.868 --> 33:18.371
- A lot of people.
- Big musical number, kiddo.

33:19.456 --> 33:21.832
A lot of people here
to make you look good.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.709
You're kind of
freaking me out.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.836
He gets that sometimes.

33:27.631 --> 33:29.006
Deep breath, honey.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.806
Okay, go!

33:37.599 --> 33:38.933
Intubate her.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.561
Is that one
okay?

33:56.284 --> 33:57.576
Charge.

34:01.665 --> 34:02.832
Here.

34:11.717 --> 34:14.427
Body temperature
37 degrees Celsius.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.178
Start the cooling.

34:19.850 --> 34:21.267
You, go.

34:26.857 --> 34:29.316
She's shivering.
200 milligrams of Vecuronium.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.198
24 degrees
Celsius.

34:44.458 --> 34:45.875
We have afib.

34:50.046 --> 34:52.757
What?
She's dead,
that's the whole idea.

34:52.883 --> 34:53.966
Go!

34:58.054 --> 34:59.680
One liter out.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.354
Two liters.

35:07.481 --> 35:09.982
Okay, put the blood back in.
Reperfuse the circuit.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.404
Anything, people,
anything at all.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.323
Internal
carotid artery in cavernous
sinus is fine.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.742
- Ten seconds!
- Vestibulocochlear nerve intact.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.411
- Middle meningeal artery clear.
- Five seconds!

35:22.537 --> 35:23.871
Nothing.

35:27.584 --> 35:29.710
We're over the limit. We've
got to start rewarming her

35:29.836 --> 35:30.753
or there'll be
permanent damage.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.379
Keep looking!

35:33.632 --> 35:35.132
There!

35:35.842 --> 35:38.219
- I didn't see anything.
- It was there.

35:38.345 --> 35:39.386
You sure?

35:39.513 --> 35:41.722
Four millimeters
lateral to the hippocampus,
I saw it.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.183
House,
she's out of time,
she's gonna be a vegetable.

35:44.309 --> 35:45.684
I saw it!

35:47.521 --> 35:49.104
That's good enough for me.

36:02.410 --> 36:06.956
They were able to restart
her heart. She's doing as well
as could be hoped.

36:07.082 --> 36:10.334
- So they found the clot?
- We think so.

36:10.460 --> 36:13.587
The neurosurgeons
are attempting to remove it
right now.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.798
And when will we know
if there was any damage?

36:15.924 --> 36:17.424
A few hours.

36:55.297 --> 36:57.715
Four millimeters
lateral to the hippocampus.

36:57.841 --> 37:00.885
That's where I am.
There's nothing there.

37:01.970 --> 37:06.432
- You're not there yet, keep going.
- I'm there.

37:07.934 --> 37:11.145
Are you sure you saw...
There it is.

37:12.272 --> 37:14.356
I think I can get it.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.296
Hi, Mom.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.674
Oh, hi.

37:57.984 --> 38:01.904
You're treating
your stuffy nose with cocaine.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.952
Diphenhydramine.
Antihistamine.

38:09.704 --> 38:13.332
New delivery system.
It's a blood-brain
barrier thing.

38:13.458 --> 38:17.962
It's all about speed,
isn't it? One thing to
another, never standing still.

38:20.590 --> 38:24.510
- You're pretty good at that.
- I know my way around a razor blade.

38:26.721 --> 38:27.888
It's time.

38:29.182 --> 38:32.893
- Just a couple more rocks.
- Andie's going home.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.771
Right.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.899
The parade
of the small bald
circus freaks.

38:39.901 --> 38:44.947
- Sorry, I've got a thing.
- I read her surgeon's report.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.866
The clot was nowhere near her amygdala.

38:47.993 --> 38:52.287
Means her fear emotions
were working perfectly.

38:52.956 --> 38:55.457
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.629
So her bravery
was not a symptom.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.884
Yeah. I was wrong.

39:07.804 --> 39:11.473
She genuinely is
a self-sacrificing saint,

39:11.599 --> 39:13.726
whose life will bring her
nothing but pain.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.562
Which she will
stoically withstand

39:16.688 --> 39:19.231
just so that her mom
doesn't have to cry
quite so soon.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.483
I'm beside myself with joy.

39:27.449 --> 39:30.492
- She enjoys life more than you do.
- Right.

39:30.618 --> 39:33.704
She stole that kiss
from Chase.
What have you done lately?

39:33.830 --> 39:37.332
I'm pacing myself.
Unlike her, I have
the luxury of time.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.378
She could outlive you.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.743
In case you wanna see
real butterflies.

40:40.647 --> 40:43.732
I'm not gonna kiss you.
No matter what you say.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.174
It's sunny outside.
You should go for a walk.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.889
Not much for the long walks
in the park.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.182
Now get.

42:02.896 --> 42:05.606
0 to 60
in 2.8 seconds.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.650
Four-stroke, four cylinder,
liquid cooled.

42:09.319 --> 42:11.904
You gain a lot of torque
according to...

42:14.115 --> 42:15.574
Right leg?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.786
Your right leg?
You can still ride.

42:20.747 --> 42:23.790
We got excellent financing
right now.
It lists for ten-eight.

42:23.917 --> 42:26.793
I'll let you steal it
out the door for ten-three.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.212
No, thanks.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.553
Could I test drive
one of these things?
