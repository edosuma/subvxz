WEBVTT

00:00.171 --> 00:02.079
Previously on...

00:02.103 --> 00:04.656
I'm going to be a
stay-at-home dad. Huh?

00:04.680 --> 00:06.983
Some reversed roles...
I've been thinkin' about you.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.056
So you came to ask me out?

00:09.080 --> 00:11.058
Some were welcomed in...
'Cause I'll say yes.

00:11.082 --> 00:13.460
I've moved on.
You should do the same.

00:13.484 --> 00:15.292
Some were shown the door...

00:15.316 --> 00:17.764
Will you marry me?

00:17.788 --> 00:19.496
And some... Huh?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.390
Never got the chance... Aah!

00:26.057 --> 00:29.127
To find out
what they really wanted.

00:30.661 --> 00:33.440
Betty applewhite
was a gifted woman.

00:33.464 --> 00:38.014
Everyone had always said so
ever since she was a child.

00:38.038 --> 00:42.049
Her first piano teacher
praised her dexterity.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.022
Her first college professor

00:46.046 --> 00:48.525
applauded her sense of rhythm...

00:50.251 --> 00:55.102
Her first symphony conductor
hailed her dramatic flair...

00:57.428 --> 01:00.407
But Betty was no longer
a concert pianist.

01:00.431 --> 01:03.270
She was now just a woman
with a secret,

01:03.294 --> 01:06.321
one she was determined to keep
by any means necessary.

01:06.345 --> 01:08.215
I'm not a bit surprised

01:08.239 --> 01:10.447
that somebody broke
into Gabrielle's house.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.449
Wisteria Lane is an easy target.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.626
It's not like the police
patrol around here.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.323
We still have
the neighborhood watch.

01:16.347 --> 01:18.325
Oh, the neighborhood watch
is a joke.

01:18.349 --> 01:22.129
When was the last time
any of you went on patrol, huh?

01:22.153 --> 01:24.761
Now I put security lights
on my house.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.464
I say it's time that we hire
professional security.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.266
Well, that sounds expensive.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.268
Could you really put a price
on your kids' safety?

01:31.292 --> 01:33.670
Well, you probably could.
Look, mcclusky, I am as worried

01:33.694 --> 01:36.208
as everybody else in this
neighborhood, but I just...

01:36.232 --> 01:38.205
We've got to stop this.

01:38.229 --> 01:40.207
And say what,
we're against security?

01:40.231 --> 01:42.209
But if they find Caleb first... hush,
Matthew. I'm trying to think.

01:42.233 --> 01:43.450
I'm not talking about
a bunch of vigilantes,

01:43.474 --> 01:45.752
I'm talking about trained men
who know when to shoot.

01:45.776 --> 01:47.254
Do we really need
professional security?

01:47.278 --> 01:49.085
Are you all gonna wait

01:49.109 --> 01:50.587
until somebody else is attacked?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.859
I think it's time to take a vote
on armed security.

01:52.883 --> 01:55.197
Let's vote now.

01:55.221 --> 01:57.194
I've had enough.
All those in favor...

02:01.552 --> 02:05.732
Oh, sorry. Things were
just getting so dramatic.

02:05.756 --> 02:07.103
Wow, you're really good.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.607
We were taking a vote here.
She was a concert pianist.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.110
Well, I dabbled a bit.

02:19.410 --> 02:23.620
Yes, Betty applewhite
was a gifted woman...

02:23.644 --> 02:25.654
And the greatest
of all her gifts...

02:28.649 --> 02:36.649
Was her timing.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.538
Once they've suffered
a miscarriage,

02:41.562 --> 02:45.542
some women sit alone
in the dark for hours.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.914
They refuse to go out
in the light of day,

02:47.938 --> 02:52.719
afraid to face the possibility
that life will go on.

02:52.743 --> 02:56.323
They hold onto reminders
of their unborn child

02:56.347 --> 02:59.486
and dream
of what might have been.

02:59.510 --> 03:02.729
Yes, this is how
some women react

03:02.753 --> 03:04.763
when they've suffered
such a loss.

03:06.417 --> 03:10.817
Gabrielle solis
was not one of those women.

03:15.766 --> 03:18.345
Hi, guys.

03:18.369 --> 03:20.307
Hi, honey. Hi.

03:20.331 --> 03:21.808
How are you?

03:21.832 --> 03:23.650
I'm fine. Thank you
for the messages.

03:23.674 --> 03:25.661
I'm... I'm sorry I haven't
had time to return calls.

03:25.685 --> 03:27.354
We all cleared our schedules.

03:27.378 --> 03:28.855
We thought maybe
you could use some company.

03:28.879 --> 03:30.757
So we're going to
go to my house.

03:30.781 --> 03:33.860
I made banana bread,
and we'll put on a fresh pot,

03:33.884 --> 03:36.863
and just talk about anything.

03:36.887 --> 03:39.896
That sounds so nice.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.198
It's just
I'm booked solid today.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.670
My head's gonna explode.

03:43.694 --> 03:45.372
Can I take a rain check?

03:45.396 --> 03:47.396
Sure.

03:48.359 --> 03:49.336
Thanks.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.208
Thanks for understanding.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.210
Okay, well, uh,
I will call you tonight

03:54.234 --> 03:55.949
and we'll figure out a time later
in the week. Well, I'll tell you what,

03:55.973 --> 03:57.944
since it's my schedule
that seems to be the problem,

03:57.968 --> 04:00.387
why don't I just figure out
a time and call you?

04:00.411 --> 04:01.948
Okay.

04:01.972 --> 04:03.950
I just... I have so many
errands to run

04:03.974 --> 04:07.254
and a million things to return.

04:07.278 --> 04:11.858
Oh, honey, there's no reason why
you and Carlos can't try again.

04:11.882 --> 04:13.260
You'd be an amazing mother.

04:13.284 --> 04:15.971
You should hold onto
that stuff for a while.

04:15.995 --> 04:18.233
Yeah, you know, I would,

04:18.257 --> 04:23.288
but the store has this strict
30-day return policy.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.622
Carlos, what happened?

04:35.646 --> 04:37.884
I've had a rough couple days.

04:37.908 --> 04:39.786
After you told me about the...

04:39.810 --> 04:43.259
The baby...

04:43.283 --> 04:45.532
I kind of lost it.

04:45.556 --> 04:48.034
Carlos, your hands.

04:48.058 --> 04:49.996
I ripped my mattress open.

04:50.020 --> 04:51.668
Jeez, how are you feeling today?

04:51.692 --> 04:55.672
They're injecting me
with this tranquilizer thing.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.696
I think it's doing the trick.

04:59.530 --> 05:04.411
We never even
talked about names.

05:04.435 --> 05:06.453
I had my top five
all picked out.

05:06.477 --> 05:07.554
Honey.

05:07.578 --> 05:10.557
You want to hear 'em?
No, I'm good.

05:10.581 --> 05:13.460
But you never
thought about names?

05:13.484 --> 05:16.468
Oh, well, it was a little soon
for that, don't you think?

05:16.492 --> 05:19.687
I mean, how can you name
something the size of a walnut?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.831
Is this new?

05:24.855 --> 05:28.335
Do you like it?
I picked it up on the way here.

05:28.359 --> 05:31.838
You just lost a baby.

05:31.862 --> 05:33.410
We all grieve differently.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.747
You seem to be
takin' it pretty well.

05:35.771 --> 05:38.314
I go shopping, you rip toilets
out of the wall...

05:38.338 --> 05:39.816
Different strokes.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.018
Are you even sad?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.990
Oh, please. What do you think?

05:44.014 --> 05:46.393
Honestly? I don't know.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.395
Of course, I'm sad.
It's a sad situation.

05:48.419 --> 05:49.619
Now let go of me.

05:52.483 --> 05:56.002
Oh, man. Honey, are you okay?

05:56.026 --> 05:58.334
I think my tranquilizer's
wearing off.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.828
Well, let's
get you another round.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.379
Hey, Mike.

06:12.403 --> 06:16.453
So my mom's wedding's
in a couple days,

06:16.477 --> 06:18.425
and I know you sent back
that little card

06:18.449 --> 06:20.427
saying you were coming
and that you preferred beef,

06:20.451 --> 06:22.429
which, actually,
I changed to fish for you

06:22.453 --> 06:24.431
'cause I tasted the beef.

06:24.455 --> 06:27.415
Anyways, I know that was
before we, you know.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.738
Send your mom my apologies,

06:31.762 --> 06:34.502
but I won't be attending. Oh.

06:36.567 --> 06:40.507
I hope that's not just because
of us not being us anymore.

06:40.531 --> 06:42.509
I mean, we could be together
at a wedding,

06:42.533 --> 06:44.520
and it wouldn't
have to be weird.

06:44.544 --> 06:46.653
It'd be weird.

06:46.677 --> 06:50.817
Of course. Yeah, I see that.

06:50.841 --> 06:54.861
Oh. Uh, heh.

06:54.885 --> 06:57.494
So what have you been
doing lately?

06:57.518 --> 06:58.725
Oh, just the usual.

06:58.749 --> 07:01.728
Well, I've been writing a book.

07:01.752 --> 07:03.730
It's sort of autobiographical.

07:03.754 --> 07:05.741
It's really been forcing me
to reexamine

07:05.765 --> 07:09.506
some of the different things
that have made me me,

07:09.530 --> 07:12.509
like the fact that
my mother had me so young,

07:12.533 --> 07:16.543
and I never knew my dad.
Big stuff like that.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.585
I told you about my dad, right?

07:18.609 --> 07:20.517
He... he was a merchant marine,

07:20.541 --> 07:22.519
and his platoon was killed
in the battle of Hanoi?

07:22.543 --> 07:25.492
That's strange. Why?

07:25.516 --> 07:27.494
Well,
Hanoi wasn't enemy territory.

07:27.518 --> 07:29.656
There wasn't a battle there.
Are you sure?

07:29.680 --> 07:32.829
That's what my mom said.
I'm pretty sure, yeah.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.840
The merchant marines
don't fight.

07:34.864 --> 07:37.433
They deliver supplies on ships.

07:37.457 --> 07:42.438
Oh. Well, clearly I have
more research to do.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.611
So what do you think?

07:44.635 --> 07:48.114
My life story... would you
rush out and buy a copy?

07:48.138 --> 07:51.047
Susan... Yeah?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.779
You really need to step back.

07:52.803 --> 07:54.853
Ooh! Ah.

08:11.021 --> 08:13.640
Porter, Preston,
what have I told you

08:13.664 --> 08:18.004
about playing outside
after dark? It's not dark.

08:18.028 --> 08:21.578
Does your dad know you're out here?
Don't worry, I've been watching 'em.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.610
They keep setting off
my motion sensors.

08:23.634 --> 08:25.961
I ought to send you
half my electric bill.

08:25.985 --> 08:29.485
You do that.
Okay, guys, come on over here.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.117
On the sidewalk.

08:31.141 --> 08:33.690
Stay there.
Not on the street. Thank you.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.863
Hey.

08:36.886 --> 08:38.865
Hi, babe.

08:38.889 --> 08:39.866
I'm home.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.599
Could you come here a sec?

08:42.623 --> 08:44.633
Sure. What's up?

08:46.997 --> 08:49.035
Block me, come on!

08:49.059 --> 08:51.538
Damn, they must have
snuck out again.

08:51.562 --> 08:54.510
Again? How often
does this happen?

08:54.534 --> 08:56.012
Boys, get in here now!

08:56.036 --> 08:57.844
Honey, you know
how slippery they are.

08:57.868 --> 08:59.586
It's like trying to herd cats.

08:59.610 --> 09:02.789
Tom, it's 9:00 at night.

09:02.813 --> 09:04.791
Guys, upstairs now. Let's go.

09:04.815 --> 09:08.625
Into pj's, into bed.
Honey, they're fine.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.627
You just... you worry too much.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.629
And for good reason.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.636
Someone could have
driven off with them,

09:14.660 --> 09:16.633
and you wouldn't have
even noticed.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.635
They were in the front yard.
God, when I was their age,

09:18.659 --> 09:20.637
I used to hop on my bike,
disappear for hours.

09:20.661 --> 09:21.938
My mom never batted an eye.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.770
Yeah, well,
that was a different time.

09:23.794 --> 09:25.617
You have to be more vigilant.

09:25.641 --> 09:27.113
There was a break-in
on this street.

09:27.137 --> 09:29.816
I was at the neighborhood
watch meeting, remember?

09:29.840 --> 09:31.578
I'm sorry. I've been
doing this for seven years.

09:31.602 --> 09:34.320
Trust me. You have to have eyes
in the back of your head.

09:34.344 --> 09:36.688
The two in front work just fine,
thanks. Really?

09:36.712 --> 09:38.207
Mm-hmm. Where's penny?

09:44.354 --> 09:48.594
See? Right where I left her.

10:08.679 --> 10:10.016
How did this get in the paper?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.188
I-I was going to call you.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.191
We discussed this.
We agreed to go slowly.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.193
I-I was going to call
and cancel after our talk,

10:17.217 --> 10:19.866
but things just got so hectic,
I-I forgot.

10:19.890 --> 10:22.068
Rex has only been dead
for seven weeks.

10:22.092 --> 10:23.369
So?

10:23.393 --> 10:25.380
So I don't want
every woman in this town

10:25.404 --> 10:27.674
talking about me behind my back.

10:27.698 --> 10:30.907
I'm sorry,
but isn't the damage done?

10:30.931 --> 10:33.980
Well, fortunately, people only
read the announcements

10:34.004 --> 10:35.991
when there's nothing
in the front page,

10:36.015 --> 10:38.685
and the headline today was about

10:38.709 --> 10:41.818
some catastrophic flood in Sri Lanka. Oh,
so we lucked out.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.319
Yes, we did.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.722
Now when the time comes

10:45.746 --> 10:48.354
to go public
with our relationship,

10:48.378 --> 10:51.397
I need you to discuss it
with me first.

10:51.421 --> 10:54.260
I'm the bride, after all.
It's only...

10:54.284 --> 10:55.261
Appropriate.

10:55.285 --> 10:57.125
Okay.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.237
Hmm.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.670
I will need you
to wear that ring, though.

11:03.694 --> 11:04.711
The ring?

11:04.735 --> 11:06.673
You're not wearing it.
Where is it?

11:06.697 --> 11:08.715
It's in my purse. Oh, good.

11:08.739 --> 11:10.199
Please put it on.

11:11.972 --> 11:14.180
But if people see it...

11:14.204 --> 11:15.791
They'll assume that you're
wearing your wedding ring.

11:15.815 --> 11:18.785
Oh. Maybe, but why risk it?

11:18.809 --> 11:22.759
Because a ring tells would-be
suitors a woman is spoken for.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.793
A naked hand
invites unwanted attention.

11:28.358 --> 11:31.288
Here. Let me.

11:38.769 --> 11:40.807
Uh, will that be all,
Mrs. Van De Kamp?

11:40.831 --> 11:42.678
Uh, yes, I think so,
Mr. Williams.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.132
Hi.

12:23.914 --> 12:26.254
Uhh.

12:29.479 --> 12:30.757
Aah!

12:30.781 --> 12:32.221
Oh, my god!

12:36.787 --> 12:38.905
What do you want?!

12:38.929 --> 12:40.136
Hey, hey, it's cool!

12:40.160 --> 12:42.308
No, it's not cool!
Who the hell are you?!

12:42.332 --> 12:45.176
Carlos sent me!
I'm gonna call the police!

12:45.200 --> 12:47.173
Name's Hector.
I met Carlos inside.

12:47.197 --> 12:48.767
Inside what?

12:50.040 --> 12:51.848
You mean... you mean, in prison?

12:51.872 --> 12:54.480
He told me what happened,
asked me to come by

12:54.504 --> 12:56.491
and keep an eye on you.
Can I come in?

12:56.515 --> 12:58.855
No! No, you can't come in!

12:58.879 --> 13:02.088
I brought a cooler. I'll
camp out here. No! Unh-unh!

13:02.112 --> 13:04.360
I can take care of myself, okay?

13:04.384 --> 13:07.433
Okay.

13:07.457 --> 13:09.235
Okay?

13:09.259 --> 13:11.497
Yeah, I-I get it.
You need your space.

13:11.521 --> 13:15.871
Yes. Yes, I do.
I need my space. Thank you.

13:31.581 --> 13:33.559
Come here. I want to
show you something. Okay.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.191
Come here. Hi, guys.

13:35.215 --> 13:37.023
I thought about what you said.

13:37.047 --> 13:39.025
Don't want you to worry.

13:39.049 --> 13:41.898
So I had a little talk
with the boys. Oh.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.399
Okay, guys, what do we do

13:43.423 --> 13:47.904
if a stranger asks us
to take a ride in their car?

13:47.928 --> 13:49.936
Porter.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.478
We run away and
call 9-1-1. Good man.

13:52.502 --> 13:55.281
Right, but what
if that stranger says,

13:55.305 --> 13:57.143
"hey, I know
your mommy and daddy"?

13:57.167 --> 13:59.886
What, Preston? Still run away.

13:59.910 --> 14:02.048
Yes. Okay...

14:02.072 --> 14:04.550
Can I ask a question?
Yeah, by all means.

14:04.574 --> 14:08.194
What if the stranger
is nice and not scary?

14:08.218 --> 14:09.195
Yes?

14:09.219 --> 14:11.079
Run away and call 9-1-1.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.401
So what if the stranger says

14:15.425 --> 14:18.304
they're going to take you
to the circus

14:18.328 --> 14:23.539
for pizza and elephant rides?

14:23.563 --> 14:25.872
Don't look at your dad.

14:25.896 --> 14:27.543
Eyes on me.
What are you gonna do?

14:27.567 --> 14:29.916
What are you gonna do?

14:29.940 --> 14:31.347
We...

14:31.371 --> 14:32.548
Run away?

14:32.572 --> 14:34.550
Yes! Snap.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.982
Okay, to the kitchen.

14:36.006 --> 14:39.176
We are havin' ice cream tonight.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.529
Your smiling like that
actually meant something.

14:43.553 --> 14:46.367
Lynette, come on. We worked on
this all afternoon. They get it.

14:46.391 --> 14:49.465
Give me a break. You know
our kids. I love them dearly,

14:49.489 --> 14:51.867
but that goes in one ear
and out the other.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.941
I'm gonna have some ice cream.

14:54.965 --> 14:56.172
Tom, you're not
off the hook here.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.174
Lynette, I can
keep my children alive.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.176
When you left this morning,
there were four.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.178
When you came home,
there were still four.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.080
When you come home
and there are only three,

15:04.104 --> 15:06.644
then you get to lecture me.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.889
Excuse me.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.297
Are you Bree Van De Kamp?
Uh, yes, I am.

15:16.321 --> 15:19.025
My name is Leila mitzman.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

15:19.049 --> 15:20.326
Can I help you?

15:20.350 --> 15:23.469
This may sound odd,
but I felt I should see you.

15:23.493 --> 15:26.337
I read in the paper that you're
engaged to George Williams.

15:26.361 --> 15:29.535
Oh, well, that announcement
was a bit premature.

15:29.559 --> 15:33.179
But you and George
are involved...

15:33.203 --> 15:35.311
In a romantic relationship?

15:35.335 --> 15:38.484
Yes.

15:38.508 --> 15:40.486
Then we need to talk.

15:40.510 --> 15:43.089
We'd been dating for six months

15:43.113 --> 15:45.096
when he asked me to marry him.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.024
From the moment I said "yes,"
George got so possessive,

15:48.048 --> 15:50.496
and when he found out

15:50.520 --> 15:52.498
my ex lived
just down the street,

15:52.522 --> 15:55.501
George accused me of seeing him
behind his back.

15:55.525 --> 15:57.503
And then one night,
I got a call from the police.

15:57.527 --> 16:00.606
Someone had set
my ex's car on fire.

16:00.630 --> 16:02.268
I could never prove anything,

16:02.292 --> 16:04.940
but I knew it was George.
I left him the next day.

16:04.964 --> 16:09.075
Well, I don't know what to say.

16:09.099 --> 16:10.476
I know. It's upsetting.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.079
Yes, it is...

16:13.103 --> 16:15.690
To have a complete stranger
come into my home,

16:15.714 --> 16:17.123
drink my tea,

16:17.147 --> 16:18.985
and then try to turn me against

16:19.009 --> 16:21.087
one of the sweetest men
I have ever known.

16:21.111 --> 16:23.659
Honey, you got to trust me.
George is a whack job,

16:23.683 --> 16:25.970
and you should get
while the getting's good.

16:25.994 --> 16:28.464
I think it's time
for you to leave.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.497
One time, I was talking
to a guy at a bar,

16:31.521 --> 16:33.699
and when we got home,
George slapped me.

16:33.723 --> 16:35.341
What do you say to that?

16:35.365 --> 16:37.343
I say, given
your overall demeanor

16:37.367 --> 16:39.345
and your freewheeling
use of epithets,

16:39.369 --> 16:41.577
I'm willing to bet
that he was provoked.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.749
Oh.

16:43.773 --> 16:46.487
When I read that
you were engaged to George,

16:46.511 --> 16:49.155
I felt it was my duty
to let you know he's crazy.

16:49.179 --> 16:51.157
But now that I've met you,

16:51.181 --> 16:54.041
I can see
it's a match made in heaven.

17:04.094 --> 17:08.174
I'm here. Hi, morty,
reverend Hopkins.

17:08.198 --> 17:10.076
I'm sorry I'm late
to your rehearsal.

17:10.099 --> 17:13.079
Oh, it's okay. It's all right.
You're here now.

17:13.103 --> 17:15.111
It's fine. Go in front of me.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.084
Okay, reverend,
hit it!

17:18.108 --> 17:19.785
Mom, can I ask you a question?

17:19.809 --> 17:21.787
You've got to march,
susie. Got to march. Oh.

17:21.810 --> 17:25.121
Oh. I was just
researching my book,

17:25.145 --> 17:27.123
and I found the strangest thing.

17:27.146 --> 17:30.056
No one with my father's name
was ever a merchant marine.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.129
Oh, did I say merchant?

17:33.153 --> 17:35.136
Well, I just meant
the regular marines.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.133
Oh, well, yeah, I thought
you probably did.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.304
So I checked that, too,
and he wasn't there,

17:38.328 --> 17:40.436
and so I called the v.A.,

17:40.460 --> 17:42.108
and there is not a single record

17:42.132 --> 17:45.071
of anyone named Harrison Ross
in Vietnam.

17:45.095 --> 17:48.074
This is not the time, susie.

17:48.098 --> 17:50.246
What's... what's the holdup,
ladies?

17:50.270 --> 17:53.048
Well, I'm sorry
to upset you, mom, I just...

17:53.072 --> 17:54.450
Don't you think that's weird?

17:54.474 --> 17:56.152
What's... what's weird?

17:56.176 --> 17:58.154
Well, there's no record

17:58.178 --> 18:01.157
of anyone with my dad's name
in the armed services.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.181
Oh, well, there it is.

18:05.215 --> 18:06.232
There what is?

18:06.256 --> 18:09.095
Morty, just go on back up there.

18:09.119 --> 18:11.097
Look, I'm... I'm not
gonna say that

18:11.121 --> 18:17.231
I knew this would happen,
but I knew this would happen.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.747
Mom, I need answers.

18:21.771 --> 18:23.749
Do you have to do this now?

18:23.773 --> 18:26.117
You are ruining
my wedding rehearsal.

18:26.141 --> 18:28.114
Well, you've been married
four times.

18:28.138 --> 18:30.156
I think you got it down.

18:30.180 --> 18:34.190
I will not stand here
and be attacked!

18:34.214 --> 18:37.154
Mom,
don't walk away from me. Ow!

18:38.288 --> 18:40.196
What do you want me to say?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.268
You want me
to say I'm a bad mother?

18:42.292 --> 18:47.573
Fine! I'm a bad mother!
Are you happy now?

18:49.429 --> 18:51.607
Mom! Mom.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.109
Mom.

18:54.133 --> 18:58.173
Yes, yes, I-I know
what I'm getting into.

19:07.617 --> 19:09.825
Morty? Morty,
have you seen my mom?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.827
Yeah. Yeah, she seemed, uh,

19:11.851 --> 19:14.830
she seemed pretty upset.
I-I think...

19:14.854 --> 19:17.163
I think she took a cab home.

19:17.187 --> 19:19.365
You need... you need a ride?

19:19.389 --> 19:22.168
I need to you tell me
the truth about my father.

19:22.192 --> 19:24.832
Hop in.

19:27.897 --> 19:30.876
When, uh, when I was in Korea,

19:30.900 --> 19:33.519
I was stationed
outside of, uh, Pusan,

19:33.543 --> 19:35.481
and we'd, uh,

19:35.505 --> 19:38.384
we'd... we'd get these...
These passes, you know,

19:38.408 --> 19:40.386
and we'd...
And we'd go into town,

19:40.410 --> 19:43.158
and, you know, we'd have a...
Have a few beers,

19:43.182 --> 19:45.691
and we used to call it r and r

19:45.715 --> 19:47.863
in... in military lingo.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.365
Yeah, well, I know
what r and r means.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.166
So what does this
have to do with my father?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.168
Well, that's...
That's what I'm getting to.

19:53.192 --> 19:57.172
Um, a-anyway, there were
these... these young ladies.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.674
Professional...

19:58.698 --> 20:00.806
Ladies if... if you know
what I mean.

20:00.830 --> 20:03.879
Morty... can... can we just
move this along?

20:03.903 --> 20:07.813
O-Okay. Long story short,
I... it's just I never figured

20:07.837 --> 20:12.558
that my first time with a woman
would... would be in an alley...

20:12.582 --> 20:18.424
Behind a Korean noodle stand
with... with my fatigues

20:18.448 --> 20:20.396
down around my... my ankles.

20:20.420 --> 20:23.399
Okay, again, w-what does this
have to do with my father?

20:23.423 --> 20:26.410
We... we've all done things
that, uh, you know,

20:26.434 --> 20:27.903
that we're ashamed of.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.905
I mean, you know, we all...

20:29.929 --> 20:31.499
We all have secrets.

20:34.804 --> 20:38.714
Your... your... your father
wasn't a war hero.

20:38.738 --> 20:43.989
And he... he wasn't
in viet... Vietnam.

20:44.013 --> 20:46.460
Well, why would
my mother tell me that?

20:46.484 --> 20:52.398
Uh, Sophie wasn't...
Wasn't married to your father.

20:52.422 --> 20:54.400
I'm... I'm not... I'm not sure

20:54.424 --> 20:56.471
she even...
She even knew his name.

20:56.495 --> 20:58.864
Are you saying
that I'm the result

20:58.888 --> 21:01.537
of my mother having
a one-night stand?

21:01.561 --> 21:04.440
Well, like I... like I said,
we've all, you know,

21:04.464 --> 21:07.443
we've... we've all done things

21:07.467 --> 21:10.497
that we're...
That we're ashamed of.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.558
George.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.530
Bree. This is a surprise.

21:24.554 --> 21:26.537
I'm sorry to drop by
unannounced,

21:26.561 --> 21:28.894
but I just had
this disturbing visit

21:28.918 --> 21:32.868
from an old friend of yours,
a Leila mitzman.

21:32.892 --> 21:37.803
She, uh, shouldn't have
contacted you.

21:37.827 --> 21:41.847
Well, she did, and she said

21:41.871 --> 21:44.510
some pretty horrible things
about you.

21:44.534 --> 21:46.521
You should know that
she's a renowned liar.

21:46.545 --> 21:48.684
That's what I thought at first,

21:48.708 --> 21:50.686
but then having had time
to think about it,

21:50.710 --> 21:52.718
I can't understand
why she'd go to so much trouble.

21:52.742 --> 21:54.690
I mean, what would
her motive be?

21:54.714 --> 21:57.923
She's obsessed with me.
She still wants me.

21:57.947 --> 21:59.825
Wasn't it obvious?

21:59.849 --> 22:02.398
No.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.370
The woman is absolutely
certifiable.

22:04.394 --> 22:07.473
What's more, I can prove it.

22:07.497 --> 22:08.634
Leila was a customer here.

22:08.658 --> 22:10.636
Even though
she's no longer welcome,

22:10.660 --> 22:12.900
we still keep
her prescriptions on file.

22:18.107 --> 22:20.085
"Fluoxetine, 100 milligrams."

22:20.109 --> 22:25.320
"Risperidone, 250 mil"...
I'm sorry. What is this?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.661
One is an antidepressant
for mood swings.

22:27.685 --> 22:29.655
One is an antipsychotic

22:29.679 --> 22:32.498
to control hallucinations.

22:32.522 --> 22:34.500
Like I said,
she's a very troubled lady.

22:34.524 --> 22:38.704
Well, then why did you
date her in the first place?

22:38.728 --> 22:41.428
In the beginning, you're blind
to the flaws, right?

22:43.433 --> 22:47.473
That's true... In the beginning.

22:47.497 --> 22:49.945
So we're good?

22:49.969 --> 22:55.369
Yeah, of course we are.

23:24.734 --> 23:25.711
Oh!

23:25.735 --> 23:26.812
Your mail came.

23:26.836 --> 23:29.084
You said you were leaving.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.086
No, I said
I was giving you space.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.459
I did. I was watchin' you
from my car.

23:33.483 --> 23:36.892
Look, the guy who broke in
stole ice cream.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.894
I don't think I'm in any danger.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.826
So you can go. I don't need you.

23:40.850 --> 23:42.598
Carlos says you do.

23:45.495 --> 23:47.673
Where are you going?

23:47.697 --> 23:49.404
Shopping... not that it's
any of your business.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.938
You sure like to shop.
Yes, I do.

23:52.962 --> 23:55.489
That's all I've seen you do
the past day and a half.

23:55.513 --> 23:57.443
Uh-huh.

23:57.467 --> 23:59.645
All that shopping must be
making up for something.

23:59.669 --> 24:01.647
Excuse me?

24:01.671 --> 24:03.489
You know,
Carlos has your number.

24:03.513 --> 24:05.491
He says you're one tough cookie.

24:05.515 --> 24:07.493
So tough, you don't have to
deal with your feelings.

24:07.517 --> 24:09.455
He's a perceptive man.

24:09.479 --> 24:11.457
He thought I was cheating
with two gay guys.

24:11.481 --> 24:13.559
Are you sure you want to go
with perceptive? Well, let's see.

24:13.583 --> 24:15.910
It's been what, a week
since you lost your baby?

24:15.934 --> 24:17.663
Yeah, so?

24:17.687 --> 24:20.566
So I never heard
of shopping out the pain.

24:20.590 --> 24:22.568
Why is everyone
on my back about this?

24:22.592 --> 24:26.542
I will deal
with my loss my way, okay?!

24:33.643 --> 24:36.021
Where are you going?

24:36.045 --> 24:37.523
Ah, I, uh, I just thought

24:37.547 --> 24:39.454
I would go out
and look some more...

24:39.478 --> 24:42.457
I'm gonna try the park.
In the middle of the night?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.459
Well, yeah. Well, he hasn't
really been showing his face

24:44.483 --> 24:46.461
in the daylight, has he?

24:46.485 --> 24:49.695
Or would you rather
we just let Caleb run loose?

24:49.719 --> 24:51.697
He could be in trouble...

24:51.721 --> 24:53.869
Or hurting another girl.

24:53.893 --> 24:57.573
He didn't hurt
Mrs. Solis, Matthew.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.605
He was just hungry.

24:59.629 --> 25:03.549
Yeah, well, I wasn't
talking about Mrs. Solis,

25:03.573 --> 25:05.883
but you know that.

25:50.620 --> 25:53.528
So are you still going to be
my matron of honor?

25:53.552 --> 25:56.201
Of course I am.

25:56.225 --> 25:58.203
I'm not gonna pretend like

25:58.227 --> 26:00.666
I'm not still
a little freaked out. I am.

26:00.690 --> 26:03.168
But I did a lot of thinking
about it this morning,

26:03.192 --> 26:05.641
and I-I think I understand.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.113
You wanted to protect me,

26:08.137 --> 26:10.816
and you thought I needed a hero.

26:10.840 --> 26:15.951
I had one. You.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.675
Oh.

26:19.849 --> 26:23.158
I was always so worried
I would screw you up.

26:23.182 --> 26:26.762
Well, I am screwed up,
but it wasn't your fault...

26:26.786 --> 26:28.986
Entirely. Oh.

26:41.771 --> 26:43.679
Hey, st...

26:43.703 --> 26:44.880
You busy?

26:44.904 --> 26:47.713
No, just updating my blog.

26:47.737 --> 26:50.315
'Cause I've got an important
assignment for you.

26:50.339 --> 26:51.817
Great. I'm really ready

26:51.841 --> 26:54.760
to take on more
responsibility around here.

26:54.784 --> 26:57.031
Yeah, I applaud that,
but what I need

26:57.055 --> 27:00.025
is for you to help me
to prove a point...

27:00.049 --> 27:01.867
To my husband.

27:01.891 --> 27:05.300
Oh. You want
to make him jealous.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.803
Uh, no.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.676
Actually...

27:10.700 --> 27:14.660
I need you to kidnap
my children.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.983
Stop hitting me!

27:18.007 --> 27:20.986
Okay, so what am I
supposed to be lookin' at?

27:21.010 --> 27:22.670
Just wait for it.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.654
Okay, here he comes.

27:28.678 --> 27:30.048
Ow!

27:31.821 --> 27:33.799
What's goin' on?

27:33.823 --> 27:36.401
I'm just trying
to prove a point.

27:36.425 --> 27:39.234
Hi...

27:39.258 --> 27:40.666
Little boys.

27:40.690 --> 27:41.667
Hell, who is that?

27:41.691 --> 27:43.669
It's... it's just stu
from our office.

27:43.693 --> 27:47.172
You guys want to go for a ride?

27:47.196 --> 27:49.344
And is he abducting our kids?

27:49.368 --> 27:50.345
Maybe.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.848
This is crazy.

27:52.872 --> 27:56.852
Why? Are you worried
they might get in?

27:56.876 --> 27:59.685
We can go to the, uh, carnival.

27:59.709 --> 28:01.026
You like carnivals?

28:01.050 --> 28:03.158
We're not allowed
to talk to strangers.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.359
Run, boys.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.061
So, uh,

28:06.085 --> 28:07.733
why don't you boys
get in the car...

28:07.757 --> 28:10.696
Run away. Run.

28:10.720 --> 28:12.197
Get in the car,
and I'll give you some candy.

28:12.221 --> 28:13.238
Yeah! Candy!

28:13.262 --> 28:16.742
Why aren't they running away?

28:16.766 --> 28:17.743
Well...

28:17.767 --> 28:19.745
This is not the time to be smug.

28:19.769 --> 28:21.747
Clearly our sons are...

28:21.771 --> 28:23.248
Idiots.

28:23.272 --> 28:25.132
Okay, okay, jeez.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.716
Hi.

28:30.740 --> 28:32.758
Hi.

28:32.782 --> 28:33.759
Ow!

28:33.783 --> 28:36.261
Oh, my god! Ow!

28:36.285 --> 28:39.224
Run, kids, run! Run!
No, you don't.

28:39.248 --> 28:41.797
Ow! Ow!

28:41.821 --> 28:45.370
You pervert! Oh, no,
you're not goin' anywhere!

28:45.394 --> 28:47.202
Oh! Aah!

28:47.226 --> 28:50.035
Oh! Oh!

28:50.059 --> 28:52.077
Ow! Ow!

28:56.235 --> 29:01.346
Um, a-anyway, after...
After we... we wrap this shindig,

29:01.370 --> 29:05.490
I'm whisking my new bride,
uh, away

29:05.514 --> 29:08.053
on a 4-month cruise
around the world.

29:13.923 --> 29:16.310
I-I would have been happy
with a-a weekend in Vegas,

29:16.334 --> 29:20.305
but you know...

29:20.329 --> 29:21.867
Anyway, here... here she is.

29:21.891 --> 29:25.431
My, um, my beautiful bride.

29:29.398 --> 29:31.746
I want to thank everyone
for coming,

29:31.770 --> 29:35.851
and especially my morty,

29:35.875 --> 29:37.752
who's helped me

29:37.776 --> 29:39.224
be a better person.

29:39.248 --> 29:41.787
And I want to thank...

29:41.811 --> 29:47.863
My amazing daughter Susan,
and tell her

29:47.887 --> 29:54.817
how much I appreciate
her love and respect...

29:57.526 --> 30:00.475
Because I'm a horrible person,

30:00.499 --> 30:03.879
and she deserves
so much better than me.

30:06.235 --> 30:07.835
Honey, honey.
No, no, no, no, no.

30:10.409 --> 30:12.409
Susan needs to know the truth.

30:15.915 --> 30:19.224
Your father...

30:19.248 --> 30:22.318
Was not a one-night stand.

30:25.824 --> 30:31.837
He was 33, and he was married...

30:31.861 --> 30:34.109
And he was my boss.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.443
When I told him I was pregnant,

30:38.467 --> 30:45.050
he broke it off, and he never
spoke to me again.

30:45.074 --> 30:51.096
But he gave me my beautiful,
incredible daughter,

30:51.120 --> 30:56.061
and for that,
I want to thank Addison prudy.

30:56.085 --> 31:00.335
Oh, my god.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.967
Do you know where he is?

31:01.991 --> 31:06.972
I have no idea. I swear,
if I knew, I-I would tell you.

31:06.996 --> 31:08.914
Uh, I know Addison prudy.

31:08.938 --> 31:12.517
He runs the feed and supply
store at third and sutherland.

31:14.173 --> 31:20.383
Uh, prudy's
a fairly common name of... so.

31:21.550 --> 31:23.380
Is that him?

31:25.484 --> 31:27.262
Yes.

31:27.286 --> 31:31.436
Are you saying
that all this time

31:31.460 --> 31:33.568
my father has been alive,
and just

31:33.592 --> 31:37.402
right across town running
the supply and feed store?

31:37.426 --> 31:39.044
Susan...

31:39.068 --> 31:41.468
I can't believe this!

31:52.041 --> 31:57.021
You're not... you're not still...
Still seeing him, are you?

32:10.299 --> 32:12.477
Is something wrong?

32:12.501 --> 32:14.940
You've been so quiet
all evening.

32:14.964 --> 32:18.183
No, no, I'm just tired,
that's all.

32:18.207 --> 32:20.445
Care to dance?
It might pep you up.

32:20.469 --> 32:22.939
I don't think so.
But thank you, though.

32:26.515 --> 32:28.293
Bree, where is your ring?

32:28.317 --> 32:30.295
Oh, um, the...
The stone is loose.

32:30.319 --> 32:32.998
So I'm gonna take it
to the jewelers.

32:33.022 --> 32:34.629
But don't worry, it's safe.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.002
This isn't about Leila, is it?

32:37.026 --> 32:39.004
No. No. It's like I told you,

32:39.028 --> 32:42.137
the stone could just pop off
at any second.

32:42.161 --> 32:45.040
Well, I don't care.
Please put it on.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.341
What?

32:46.365 --> 32:48.043
I want you to wear it.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.315
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm not going to.

32:50.339 --> 32:51.676
Why not?

32:51.700 --> 32:53.678
Because I don't feel like it.

32:53.702 --> 32:56.429
And this is the last time we're
gonna talk about this, okay?

32:56.453 --> 32:58.183
Excuse me, ma'am.

32:58.207 --> 33:01.277
We don't allow members
of zeta beta kappa in here.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.730
Ty! Ty Grant.

33:05.754 --> 33:08.071
Oh, hi!
What are you doing in town?

33:08.095 --> 33:10.095
Visiting my folks.

33:10.119 --> 33:12.437
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, George, this is Ty Grant.

33:12.461 --> 33:15.140
We used to date in college.

33:15.164 --> 33:17.442
Ty, this is George, um...

33:17.466 --> 33:19.144
He's a good friend of mine.

33:19.168 --> 33:20.975
Actually, we're engaged.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.399
Ah.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.590
Bree, you look fantastic.
You haven't aged a day.

33:26.614 --> 33:29.054
Ty, would you like to dance?

33:29.078 --> 33:31.486
Sure. I'd love to.

33:31.510 --> 33:34.080
Let me take your coat.

33:43.692 --> 33:46.732
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

34:12.481 --> 34:14.159
I need to cut in.

34:14.183 --> 34:16.170
George, would you please
sit down?

34:16.194 --> 34:17.462
You're being rude.

34:17.485 --> 34:19.134
Am I in the middle of something?

34:19.158 --> 34:21.136
Well, at least put on the ring.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.068
No. George, I don't want to.

34:23.092 --> 34:25.370
We are engaged.
You have to wear it!

34:25.393 --> 34:28.103
Hey, knock it off, man.
George, stop it.

34:34.703 --> 34:36.551
I'm sorry.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.574
I just...

34:40.779 --> 34:42.257
We're engaged.

34:42.281 --> 34:46.491
See, the thing is,
I don't think we are anymore.

34:46.514 --> 34:48.263
Bree.

34:48.286 --> 34:49.857
Please... You should go.

34:58.197 --> 35:00.197
I'm really sorry.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.317
Oh, hi.

35:22.291 --> 35:23.568
Right over there, sir.

35:23.592 --> 35:26.122
Management likes us to keep
the nice cars out front.

35:53.922 --> 35:55.230
Afternoon.

35:55.254 --> 35:57.702
New hairdo? So what if it is?

35:57.726 --> 35:59.204
It looks nice, that's all.

35:59.228 --> 36:01.206
You know, I also got a facial,

36:01.230 --> 36:03.208
and later on I'm gonna get
a pedicure

36:03.232 --> 36:05.170
and an eyebrow wax, so there.

36:05.194 --> 36:06.711
It's fine with me.

36:06.735 --> 36:08.343
No, it's not, because I know
what you're thinking.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.445
Yeah? You know what?

36:10.469 --> 36:12.617
I am tired of you judging me.

36:12.641 --> 36:15.320
What is it gonna take
to get rid of you, hmm?

36:15.344 --> 36:17.282
What's your last name?

36:17.306 --> 36:18.683
Ramos.

36:18.707 --> 36:22.627
Ramos. Here is $1,000.

36:22.651 --> 36:24.659
I won't tell Carlos
you didn't stick around.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.562
It'll be our little secret.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.264
I just got out of prison.

36:29.288 --> 36:31.266
I'm not exactly set up
with a bank account.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.268
Can we go to your bank
and cash this?

36:33.292 --> 36:35.270
And then you'll leave?

36:35.294 --> 36:37.774
Hey, it's a grand.

36:39.668 --> 36:42.328
Buckle up.

36:43.932 --> 36:46.481
You don't have
a-a window thingy.

36:46.505 --> 36:48.205
Nope.

36:50.339 --> 36:54.259
You don't have
a door handle either.

36:54.283 --> 36:56.493
Nope.

36:58.287 --> 37:01.466
But I do have
a confession to make.

37:01.490 --> 37:06.300
Carlos didn't really send me
to protect you.

37:23.612 --> 37:25.990
Go figure.

37:26.014 --> 37:27.992
No one else in the park.

37:28.016 --> 37:30.224
We got it all to ourselves.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.248
Perfect.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.440
Why don't you go find us
a good spot?

37:45.464 --> 37:48.344
I gotta get something
out of the trunk.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.648
Hey, where the hell you goin'?

38:06.655 --> 38:08.293
You're not gonna kill me?

38:08.317 --> 38:11.866
I hadn't planned on it.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.299
Besides, if I was
gonna kill you,

38:14.323 --> 38:15.800
I wouldn't use a balloon.

38:15.824 --> 38:17.442
It would take too long.

38:17.466 --> 38:19.944
What am I supposed to think?
You lie about protecting me

38:19.968 --> 38:22.407
and then you lock me in that
heap without door handles

38:22.431 --> 38:23.908
so I can't get out.

38:23.932 --> 38:26.359
Carlos sent me
to help you with your grief.

38:26.383 --> 38:28.453
You're kidding, right?

38:28.477 --> 38:29.584
No.

38:29.608 --> 38:32.587
Look, I know
a little somethin' about loss.

38:32.611 --> 38:35.320
It can take you
to some real dark places,

38:35.344 --> 38:37.301
especially if you don't
face it head-on,

38:37.325 --> 38:41.466
like 17 years
in a 6x10 prison cell.

38:41.490 --> 38:43.320
Dark.

38:45.093 --> 38:47.432
What's this for?

38:47.456 --> 38:51.376
The balloon represents
the spirit of the life lost.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.677
By lettin' it go,

38:52.701 --> 38:54.679
you're acknowledging
the pain you feel

38:54.703 --> 38:57.442
and releasin' it
at the same time.

38:57.466 --> 38:59.884
Okay, that's ridiculous.

38:59.908 --> 39:03.648
Besides, I don't feel
what you think I'm feeling.

39:03.672 --> 39:05.420
Then it should be real easy.

39:05.444 --> 39:08.393
Fine, if I do this, will you go?

39:08.417 --> 39:09.677
Yeah.

39:13.722 --> 39:16.401
Okay... Should I say something?

39:16.425 --> 39:17.702
If you want to.

39:17.726 --> 39:19.033
Not really, no.

39:19.057 --> 39:21.387
It's cool.

39:29.738 --> 39:32.138
Anytime.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.077
This is stupid.

39:42.711 --> 39:45.530
I didn't even want this baby.

39:45.554 --> 39:47.164
Yeah.

39:49.858 --> 39:52.937
And I would've been
a terrible mother.

39:52.961 --> 39:54.991
If you say so.

40:00.068 --> 40:03.678
If it was a boy,
I was gonna name it Charlie.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.632
Yeah?

40:08.477 --> 40:10.855
And a girl, Aurora.

40:10.879 --> 40:14.058
Those are nice names.

40:14.082 --> 40:15.982
Yeah.

40:24.993 --> 40:27.133
Thank you.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.030
What is it, boy?

41:21.710 --> 41:23.010
Aah! Ugh!

41:24.653 --> 41:26.531
What's goin' on out here?

41:26.555 --> 41:28.793
Call the police.
You need me to zap him?

41:28.817 --> 41:30.617
Just call the police.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.876
Is that the guy
who broke into your house?

41:41.900 --> 41:43.930
Uh, I don't know.
I can't see him.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.615
Yeah, that's him.

41:50.639 --> 41:53.117
In a world filled with darkness,

41:53.141 --> 41:57.822
we all need some kind of light.

41:57.846 --> 42:01.125
Whether it's a great flame
that shows us

42:01.149 --> 42:03.798
how to win back what we've lost,

42:03.822 --> 42:05.499
or a powerful beacon

42:05.523 --> 42:10.174
intended to scare away
potential monsters...

42:10.198 --> 42:12.577
Two, four, six, eight...

42:12.601 --> 42:17.542
Or a few glowing bulbs
that reveal to us

42:17.566 --> 42:20.636
the hidden truth of our past...

42:23.211 --> 42:24.689
We all need something

42:24.713 --> 42:28.053
to help us
get through the night...

42:30.218 --> 42:37.228
Even if it's just
the tiniest glimmer of hope.
