WEBVTT

00:02.753 --> 00:05.335
Crais, come in. This is Aeryn.

00:05.423 --> 00:07.209
Pilot, there's no answer
from Crais.

00:07.300 --> 00:11.259
Nor is Moya getting any
answer from Talyn.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.256
Stark:
Aeryn, what can you see?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.554
He's been hit hard.

00:17.268 --> 00:18.633
Crais.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.558
Where's Talyn?
I can barely sense him.

00:22.648 --> 00:26.061
He is alive, but unresponsive.

00:26.152 --> 00:28.188
Moya is supplying nutrients.

00:28.279 --> 00:33.945
Talyn destroyed one Prowler but
their attack was merely
a diversion.

00:34.035 --> 00:37.448
Peacekeepers...
They want Talyn back.

00:37.538 --> 00:41.326
A Vigilante with an
immobilizer pulse.

00:42.877 --> 00:47.120
What attacked Talyn was
a Retrieval Squad.

00:47.215 --> 00:50.173
You do know, John, that if
we can revive Talyn,

00:50.259 --> 00:53.342
we have to Starburst away
immediately and we
can't go back.

00:53.429 --> 00:56.637
Crais:
There is something I deeply
wish to share with you.

00:57.892 --> 00:59.302
Xhalax:
Wake up, Aeryn.

01:00.269 --> 01:01.304
I'm your mother.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.727
I came to tell you something.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.977
You were conceived in love.

01:07.068 --> 01:08.228
Our love.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.059
We wanted you.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.520
My mother.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.571
Yes.

01:14.659 --> 01:19.278
The Retrieval Squad.
She is somehow part of it.

01:19.372 --> 01:24.867
The Squad is under the command
of Senior Officer Xhalax Sun.

01:27.588 --> 01:31.376
Pilot:
They're out of the bionisphere
and Moya's sensing a Peacekeeper scan.

01:31.467 --> 01:34.254
Talyn, Starburst immediately.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.255
Talyn's done it. He's escaped.

01:38.349 --> 01:41.091
There will be no contact
with Moya

01:41.185 --> 01:43.722
until the threat of the
Retrieval Squad is resolved.

01:43.813 --> 01:47.476
They are hoping that my
mother's presence will divide
my loyalties.

01:47.566 --> 01:51.229
But I will not let them
get Talyn back.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.811
Even if it means I have
to kill her.

01:55.491 --> 01:58.278
And now on Farscape...

02:18.180 --> 02:21.593
Kama-nak, kama-nak, kama-nak...
Kama-nak, kama-nak, kama-nak...

02:21.684 --> 02:23.549
Kama-nak, kama-nak, kama-nak...

02:23.644 --> 02:25.054
Rygel!

02:25.313 --> 02:26.519
Oh...

02:26.605 --> 02:30.223
I may be small, but allow me
to remind you:

02:30.318 --> 02:34.607
that only serves to put me
at castration level!

02:34.697 --> 02:36.062
What's the matter?
Didn't sleep well?

02:36.157 --> 02:37.442
How could I?

02:37.533 --> 02:41.742
With them on the other side
of this very thin bulkhead.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.989
A bit noisy, were they?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.787
She was bad enough,
but Crichton!

02:45.875 --> 02:47.581
He was louder than she was.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.331
He actually sounded like he
was exerting himself.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.663
What kind of a male
is he anyway?

02:53.758 --> 02:55.874
Oh, they're between bouts.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.345
Give them a few microts.

02:59.764 --> 03:02.005
(yawning)

03:17.698 --> 03:19.154
Hang on.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.368
(banging and moaning)
There's another!

03:21.452 --> 03:23.238
Oh, God.

03:23.329 --> 03:24.944
(Crichton groaning )

03:25.039 --> 03:27.325
You were louder than that,
believe it or not.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.917
(laughing)

03:35.841 --> 03:38.002
How much longer?

03:38.969 --> 03:40.960
How much longer what?

03:42.890 --> 03:46.098
Does Talyn have to stay
on board this planet?

03:46.185 --> 03:49.348
Oh well, the heavy gravity's
letting him sleep.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.939
Mm-hmm.

03:51.023 --> 03:54.186
Stark said the vegetation
has restorative power,
so it's our one...

03:54.276 --> 03:56.141
Hmm?

03:56.237 --> 03:59.104
quick-stop chance to get him
back to full fighting strength.

03:59.198 --> 04:01.234
| suggest you all get up
here immediately.

04:01.325 --> 04:04.863
Talyn's senses have picked up
another ship entering the
planet's atmosphere.

04:04.954 --> 04:06.535
Dangerously close.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.988
Damn.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.289
Friend or foe? Friend or foe?
Friend or..

04:10.376 --> 04:12.241
Talyn's laboring to
discern that.

04:12.336 --> 04:16.124
If it's a Retrieval Squad, are
we going to be able to blast
our way out of here?

04:16.215 --> 04:21.130
Talyn has powered down to
stasis level on all systems
to facilitating the recuperation process.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.006
We all agreed to take
that chance.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.213
So your answer is no.
We can't move.

04:25.307 --> 04:27.969
Friend or foe? Friend or...
-Will you shut the frell up!

04:28.060 --> 04:29.641
Of course it's a foe!

04:29.728 --> 04:31.229
We have no friends!

04:31.313 --> 04:33.144
Talk to us. What do you got?

04:33.232 --> 04:37.225
Crais:
Talyn has identified it as the
Vigilante, the Peacekeeper ship pursuing us.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.571
We've got to do something.
There's nothing we can do.

04:39.655 --> 04:41.862
Crichton, you always have
a plan. Or sometimes.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.450
How close?
-It has just landed.

04:43.534 --> 04:47.072
It's your mother who's running
the frelling Retrieval Squad.

04:47.163 --> 04:48.573
Maybe we can use that.

04:48.664 --> 04:50.200
Yo! Not now, Rygel.

04:50.291 --> 04:53.328
Not now?! They're here,
Crichton, on the planet.

04:53.419 --> 04:55.626
They're going to be knocking
down that door at any microt.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.954
And our ship is sound asleep.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.304
Xhalax.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.551
Heavy gravity.

05:11.645 --> 05:15.934
Two... two and a half times
what my species is used to.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.273
How is your wound?

05:18.360 --> 05:21.272
I will earn my share.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.737
Good news.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.698
Your shares have just
increased.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.637
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost...
an astronaut.

05:45.721 --> 05:49.430
I got shot through
a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...

05:49.517 --> 05:51.098
I'm trying to stay alive...

05:51.185 --> 05:53.096
Aboard this ship...
This living ship...

05:53.187 --> 05:55.929
Of escaped prisoners.
My friends.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.479
If you can hear me...
Beware.

05:57.566 --> 05:59.522
lfl make it back...
Will they follow?

05:59.610 --> 06:02.317
If I open the door...
Are you ready?

06:02.404 --> 06:06.864
Earth is unprepared...
Helpless,
for the nightmares I've seen.

06:06.951 --> 06:09.283
Or should I stay...
Protect my home...

06:09.370 --> 06:11.827
Not show them...
You exist...

06:11.914 --> 06:15.623
But then you will never know
the wonders I've seen.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.076
Decoys? This is an
awfully big ship.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.119
You really, really, really
think the three of you...

06:55.207 --> 06:58.449
Stark, if you have any other
ideas, we'll be thrilled to
hear 'em before we go out.

06:58.544 --> 07:00.876
The Peacekeeper ship set down
some distance from here.

07:00.963 --> 07:04.547
Clearly the planet's vegetation
is masking Talyn's whereabouts,
as we were hoping.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.248
That's not gonna last forever.

07:06.343 --> 07:08.834
We've gotta get these guys away
from Talyn, give him a chance
to recuperate.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.885
Then we got a shot. Maybe.

07:10.973 --> 07:14.090
Talyn's restoration is nearly
complete. We need only buy him
a little more time.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.345
What about me? Hmm? What about
me? Why can't I go out?

07:16.437 --> 07:18.473
I agree. I am the logical
choice to stay here with Talyn.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.179
Logical, yes. But it ain't
gonna happen, boys.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.230
Listen to me. They're here
to take Talyn.

07:22.318 --> 07:24.183
We can't let them anywhere
near him when he's vulnerable
like this.

07:24.278 --> 07:28.066
Crichton, Crais and I will go
down. You will stay here
and keep him calm.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.148
Xhalax:
Wake up, Aeryn.

07:31.243 --> 07:32.949
Ahh! I've been watching this.

07:33.037 --> 07:36.575
The night your mother came
and saw you.
-My name is Xhalax Sun.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.656
I'm your mother.
-Rygel! What are you doing?!

07:38.751 --> 07:41.117
She sounds like she likes you.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.587
Maybe we can use that to...

07:42.671 --> 07:44.286
This is Aeryn's stuff.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.168
Keep your hands off and your
nose out of other people's
business.

07:47.259 --> 07:50.092
Well, er, what are we supposed
to do when you're out there

07:50.179 --> 07:52.215
and dear old mother
comes blasting in?

07:52.306 --> 07:54.638
Crichton:
Buckwheat, we're going to keep
the Retrieval Squad away

07:54.725 --> 07:57.842
and you're going to keep your
hands off Aeryn's stuff.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.096
Is that clear?

07:59.188 --> 08:00.303
( groans )

08:03.859 --> 08:06.271
I don't give a ropey dren
about heavy gravity.

08:06.362 --> 08:09.274
Our targets are near.
Keep moving.

08:09.365 --> 08:11.026
How many missions have
you been on?

08:11.116 --> 08:12.071
Six.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.023
Nine.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.324
Nine and out, right?

08:14.411 --> 08:16.663
This is your last mission
as a mercenary.

08:16.747 --> 08:19.989
You complete this one and
you can buy your freedom.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.332
You have a mate? Offspring?

08:22.419 --> 08:24.125
gees/Ag?

08:24.213 --> 08:27.125
It'd be a frelling shame if you
and your mate here screwed up

08:27.216 --> 08:30.424
and you were to start your
mission count back at zero.

08:31.220 --> 08:33.006
So frell the gravity.

08:33.097 --> 08:36.339
Cinch up your mivonks
and keep moving.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.468
( gunshots )

08:37.559 --> 08:38.719
Pulse Rifles.

08:38.811 --> 08:40.972
Definitely Peacekeeper.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.933
This way.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.730
( rifle beeping )

08:45.818 --> 08:47.149
What the hell's wrong
with this gun?

08:47.236 --> 08:48.601
I don't know.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.857
Maybe chakan mist is ruining
the pulse deploy.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.030
Well, they're either
after us or not.

08:53.117 --> 08:55.950
We've left a trail Stevie
Wonder could follow.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.151
Oh, wow. Wait.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.486
What?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.665
Oarusk fruit.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.368
Remind me not to put that
on my Cocoa Puffs.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.919
(humming)

09:08.006 --> 09:11.339
Oh, stop that ( hic)
incessant ( hic ) humming.

09:11.427 --> 09:12.382
When you stop that hiccuping.

09:12.469 --> 09:15.302
|(hic ) hiccup when
I'm ( hic) nervous.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.799
Well, I hum when I'm nervous.

09:16.890 --> 09:21.350
A ( hic ) hiccup is involuntary
you pellish ( hic ) venker!

09:21.437 --> 09:22.847
Humming isn't!

09:24.523 --> 09:25.433
Rygel.

09:25.524 --> 09:26.855
What?

09:26.942 --> 09:28.273
(gasps )

09:28.360 --> 09:31.318
Stark:
Vines from outside
growing inside.

09:31.405 --> 09:34.317
(nervous groaning)

09:36.827 --> 09:38.988
Fresh trail, that way!

09:39.079 --> 09:40.034
Indigenous?

09:40.122 --> 09:42.363
No. Sebacean.

09:45.461 --> 09:46.871
(coughing)

09:46.962 --> 09:49.544
Okay, welcome to the
butthole of the universe.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.337
(coughing)

10:01.643 --> 10:03.770
Very close.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.469
Three point vector.

10:05.564 --> 10:06.929
Are you up to this?

10:07.024 --> 10:09.231
We are ready.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.653
This can't be good.

10:18.744 --> 10:20.109
It can't be bad.

10:20.204 --> 10:23.321
It's the same vegetation that's
helping to heal Talyn.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.497
It's rooted to the planet.

10:25.584 --> 10:30.169
How's Talyn supposed to take
off with this stuff laced
through him?

10:30.255 --> 10:36.797
Once Talyn's back to full
strength, I'm sure he'll be
able to tear himself away.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.548
Easily.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.464
Come on. Pull!

10:56.031 --> 10:58.272
How far have we gone?

10:58.367 --> 11:01.154
Aeryn:
Not quite one full metra.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.736
One more metra, we should
circle back.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.037
Right.

11:06.708 --> 11:07.914
Oh...

11:09.419 --> 11:10.795
What you got?

11:13.257 --> 11:15.293
( rifle charges )

11:16.552 --> 11:17.917
That way.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.217
There!

11:31.358 --> 11:32.393
Cover me.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.492
( rifle beeping )

12:33.587 --> 12:36.875
( screaming )

12:38.508 --> 12:39.714
Aeryn?!

12:40.385 --> 12:41.420
John?

12:41.511 --> 12:43.047
Aeryn?!

12:43.138 --> 12:44.344
John.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.429
Damn.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.695
Move and you die.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.272
(coughing)

13:08.121 --> 13:09.236
( choking )

13:09.331 --> 13:10.195
Where is he?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.076
Are you Xhalax...

13:12.167 --> 13:13.452
Are you Xhalax Sun?

13:13.543 --> 13:14.498
Where is he?

13:14.586 --> 13:15.962
( coughs )

13:17.172 --> 13:18.708
(gasps )

13:26.723 --> 13:27.929
Stop!

13:33.563 --> 13:35.940
Nice to see you again, Mother.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.767
Aeryn?! Aeryn?

13:40.862 --> 13:45.196
Crais:
Crichton! Crichton!
Stop making noise or they'll find us.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.367
I've been hit.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.123
Oh hell, that's ugly.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.451
I got to find Aeryn.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.252
Crichton, don't you
leave me here.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.204
The Retrieval Squad.
They are using Colartas.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.288
They're using what?

14:02.384 --> 14:03.590
Expert trackers.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.838
You leave me here bleeding,
they will find me and kill me.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.339
And?

14:10.225 --> 14:12.011
(gasping)

14:13.228 --> 14:14.468
Are you shot?

14:14.563 --> 14:16.849
No. The gravity.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.352
One of my hearts, it has burst.

14:19.443 --> 14:20.808
Can you move?

14:20.902 --> 14:23.063
Won't slow you down.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.895
I can still track.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.150
Have you seen Xhalax?

14:26.241 --> 14:28.778
No. I can locate her.

14:28.869 --> 14:29.733
No.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.364
But she might be wounded.

14:31.455 --> 14:33.616
We pursue and retrieve
our target.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.197
That is our mission.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.375
We don't get paid for
finding Xhalax.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.369
Move.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.838
What are you doing?
-You want to bleed to death?

14:50.932 --> 14:53.890
What do you think?
-Then shut up.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.217
This might sting a little.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.428
( screams )

15:00.650 --> 15:02.936
Okay, maybe more than a little.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.065
(grunts)

15:33.391 --> 15:34.972
(grunts)

15:39.147 --> 15:41.354
This should slow the bleeding.

15:41.441 --> 15:45.400
Stop any bone from working its
way out, at least temporarily.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.436
You knew who I was.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.397
Who are you?

15:52.702 --> 15:54.363
I'm Aeryn.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.366
Aeryn Sun.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.789
I'm your daughter.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.299
If you are my daughter,
you are a Peacekeeper.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.091
I'm not a Peacekeeper anymore.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.391
Then you are with Crais.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.436
Where the hezmana have
you been?
-On the bridge.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.108
Comfortable up there?
-Listen...

16:27.195 --> 16:29.186
'Cause while you've been
frotzing around,

16:29.281 --> 16:31.988
I've been trying to keep this
dren from taking over...

16:32.075 --> 16:33.531
Rygel, shut up!

16:33.618 --> 16:35.154
Talyn, he's almost healed.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.201
What? Completely?

16:37.289 --> 16:38.620
It's a... yes...

16:38.707 --> 16:41.244
Well, can we blast ourselves
free of this yotz?

16:41.334 --> 16:43.165
Soon.

16:43.253 --> 16:46.370
If... if we can keep these
under control,

16:46.464 --> 16:49.752
then I think Talyn will be
strong enough to break free.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.255
( both chuckle )

16:53.847 --> 16:56.338
But what if the others
aren't back by then?

16:56.433 --> 17:00.176
They're up against a Peacekeeper
Retrieval Squad out there.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.261
Don't delude yourself, fahrbot.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.188
They're probably never
coming back.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.733
What do you smell?

17:12.824 --> 17:14.405
Two of them.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.357
One is unknown to me.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.660
The other is a... ( sniffs)

17:18.747 --> 17:21.409
a Sebacean. Wounded.

17:21.499 --> 17:25.833
At least with this gravity, the
Colartas will be in more
trouble than...

17:25.921 --> 17:27.582
(groans)
we are.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.537
That's a comfort.
Get up. Get up!

17:29.633 --> 17:31.123
We got to get out of here.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.300
Aeryn had the positioning
device.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.718
So she'll be able to find
her way back to Talyn.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.261
If she's still alive.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.340
(groans)
She is still alive.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.217
She is alive.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.176
Where are you taking me?

17:43.271 --> 17:44.727
Back to the gunship.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.645
Which I named Talyn,
by the way.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.018
( chuckles )

17:48.109 --> 17:50.942
Yes, I thought you'd find
that amusing.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.144
Naming it after Daddy?

17:52.239 --> 17:55.402
It's not amusing.
It's sentimental and weak.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.074
Is that why you're sparing me?

17:58.161 --> 18:00.026
Because I'm your Mummy?

18:02.123 --> 18:06.412
No. Because with that wound,
out here, you will die.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.210
Alive, you're potential
leverage.

18:09.297 --> 18:11.333
Regulation Field Op Procedure
insists you

18:11.424 --> 18:13.915
terminate all hostile personnel
on point of contact.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.171
Eliminate the threat.

18:16.263 --> 18:19.130
And when I'm dead, you can name
your Prowler after me.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.135
Oh yes, that's very funny.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.512
Well, I no long follow
Regulation Field Op Procedures,

18:23.603 --> 18:27.187
and I know it's not by chance
that you ended up out here on
this assignment.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.435
High Command knew I was out
here with Talyn and Crais.

18:29.526 --> 18:31.312
They probably thought,
"Send her mother."

18:31.403 --> 18:34.236
Or perhaps you even volunteered
for the pleasure. Did you?

18:34.322 --> 18:36.904
Thought, you know, things go
wrong, we end up face to face,

18:36.992 --> 18:39.358
perhaps the daughter
will flinch.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.410
I'm not flinching.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.203
We have no idea where
we are going.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.159
We could be going around
in circles.

18:49.254 --> 18:53.293
We're not going in circles,
nimrod, because we've never
been here before.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.919
We're completely lost.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.546
(grunts)

19:01.266 --> 19:03.598
Oh, God!

19:03.685 --> 19:06.301
I hate mazes.

19:06.396 --> 19:09.888
Oh, my first girlfriend,
Julie, she loved 'em.

19:09.983 --> 19:14.352
Oh, boy, did she. "Hey, Johnny,
let's go in the mirror maze
together, huh?"

19:14.446 --> 19:17.688
Hey, Jules! Is this makin'
you horny?

19:17.782 --> 19:21.149
Our size and weight will give
us a slight advantage
over the Colartas.

19:21.244 --> 19:24.236
But our sweat and blood
will continue to lead
them right to us.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.117
Shut up.
-You shut up.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.823
No, you shut up.
I've got an idea.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.539
What are you doing?

19:31.629 --> 19:33.130
Here, smell that.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.000
Oh! Oh!

19:35.091 --> 19:39.960
Geez! If this doesn't cover
our scent, or kill us,
I don't know what will.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.421
Camol!

19:42.515 --> 19:45.302
Yep, that's good. There you go.
Spread it around.

19:45.393 --> 19:48.226
Don't forget to cover
your private bits.

19:48.313 --> 19:55.025
How much... longer...
till Talyn is fully healed?

19:55.111 --> 19:57.067
Look, I'm still not sure we
should leave. But...

19:57.155 --> 20:01.148
We're leaving. Soon as Talyn's
ready we're leaving whether
they're here or not.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.197
You got that?

20:02.285 --> 20:04.697
Rygel, the hero.

20:04.788 --> 20:08.030
Aeryn, I always knew you'd
make it back.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.239
( chuckles )

20:09.334 --> 20:11.040
The others aren't as
capable as you.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.539
Not as strong. Not nearly...
-Shut up.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.621
Ah... this... this is
your mother?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.251
Aren't you going to
introduce us?

20:17.342 --> 20:19.674
No. What's the news on
Crichton and Crais?

20:19.761 --> 20:21.922
No news. You're the first back.

20:33.817 --> 20:36.399
Hmm, no scent.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.783
Body heat.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.251
This way.

20:58.425 --> 20:59.790
Here.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.546
Crais.

21:03.471 --> 21:04.756
Crais!

21:15.984 --> 21:18.566
All right, come on, John.
Come on, man. Concentrate.

21:18.653 --> 21:21.360
Find Aeryn, get the hell
out of here alive.

21:24.033 --> 21:27.070
Oh, poor baby.
Poor, poor, Johnny.

21:28.204 --> 21:30.160
Now is not a good time, Scorpy.
Go away.

21:30.248 --> 21:32.113
On the contrary.
You summoned me.

21:32.208 --> 21:36.121
You know what? You are really
becoming annoying. Go away!

21:36.212 --> 21:39.830
But your subconscious did and
that's where I reside, remember?

21:42.302 --> 21:44.634
This point.

21:44.721 --> 21:49.306
It needs to be sharp, but not
so spindly that it is weak.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.641
As long as you're here.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.564
These pina colada things
chasing us.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.312
Are they everything Crais has
cracked them up to be?

22:00.403 --> 22:04.942
Oh, yes. In that, at least,
Crais has been completely
forthright.

22:06.534 --> 22:10.322
Where has he not
been forthright?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.051
(grunts)

22:33.311 --> 22:36.053
As far as I could tell,
Talyn's systems are almost
back to normal.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.432
Then it's time to wake
him up and get aloft.

22:37.524 --> 22:41.108
We use Talyn's senses to locate
Crichton and Crais.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.402
( sniffs )

22:50.703 --> 22:52.659
(yells)

22:56.501 --> 22:58.082
(yelling)

22:59.212 --> 23:00.793
( knife slashes)

23:02.757 --> 23:04.839
(groaning)

23:30.368 --> 23:32.324
Talyn, activate the intruder...

23:36.416 --> 23:39.283
Let us out of here,
you snarking dellot!

23:39.377 --> 23:41.368
Let us out!

23:42.422 --> 23:44.378
Ah, you murderous little beast.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.001
You're going to be dead meat.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.879
Dead meat, dead meat,
dead meat.

23:53.391 --> 23:58.226
Oh, you really do have
three stomachs.

23:58.313 --> 24:01.601
And the smallest little heart
I've ever seen.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.113
Help... me.

24:11.284 --> 24:14.822
Please, Stark.

24:14.912 --> 24:19.246
Help... me.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.190
This is a remarkable vessel.

24:44.359 --> 24:46.270
High Command could never
have anticipated

24:46.361 --> 24:49.228
that their hybrid genetic would
evolve so successfully.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.108
What are you doing?

24:51.199 --> 24:54.566
Can't fire the ship up while he
still has the capacity for
independent thought.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.822
You're severing his
higher functions?

24:56.913 --> 25:00.030
After which, I can fly
him home manually.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.410
Techs are standing by to
bring him back to life,

25:02.502 --> 25:05.335
once he's got a
Control Collar on.

25:05.421 --> 25:06.957
Talyn is not like other
Leviathans.

25:07.048 --> 25:10.256
He will die before accepting
a Control Collar.

25:10.343 --> 25:14.552
My mission is to subdue the
Leviathan hybrid for easy
transport.

25:14.639 --> 25:17.346
Then track and deliver the
second target.

25:26.275 --> 25:30.063
Captains are the elite.

25:30.154 --> 25:34.989
The most trusted jarheads in
all the Peacekeeper ranks.

25:35.076 --> 25:40.821
'Cause, you make Captain,
you're on the A-Iist, for
all the top parties,

25:40.915 --> 25:42.701
all the heavy-duty crap that
the Peacekeepers

25:42.792 --> 25:45.283
sure as hell don't want
floating free in the universe.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.458
Crichton, listen to me.

25:46.546 --> 25:49.333
You know, I always wondered why
a swinging cat like you

25:49.424 --> 25:51.836
would be way out here
in the boondocks.

25:51.926 --> 25:57.262
Why you wanted so bad to be
Talyn's prom date and
then suddenly...

25:58.808 --> 26:01.299
it all came very clear to me.

26:03.396 --> 26:06.513
You need us.

26:06.607 --> 26:09.690
You knew we wouldn't lift
a finger to help you,

26:09.777 --> 26:13.941
but we would do anything
to protect Talyn.

26:14.031 --> 26:15.612
The Peacekeepers,

26:15.700 --> 26:18.157
they're not only after Talyn,

26:19.454 --> 26:21.445
they're after you.

26:21.539 --> 26:27.956
From the moment you set foot
on Moya, you knew that
this day was coming.

26:28.045 --> 26:31.879
And you kept us as allies
when they came gunnin'.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.040
That's not true.

26:34.135 --> 26:37.127
That's not the only reason
I wanted help you.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.303
Crichton, you can't leave
me here like this.

26:39.390 --> 26:40.596
Yes, I can.

26:40.683 --> 26:43.550
What are you going to do?

26:43.644 --> 26:49.605
If you're what the Retrieval
Squad wants, brother,
this is their lucky day.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.602
Hey, boys!

26:54.697 --> 26:56.653
Can you smell him now?!

26:56.741 --> 26:59.983
Oh, pina coladas!
-Crichton!

27:00.077 --> 27:02.204
No! Come back!

27:02.288 --> 27:03.994
Crichton!

27:04.749 --> 27:06.410
Crichton!

27:10.755 --> 27:13.622
Even in his dormant state,
he still struggles against me.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.081
Don't do this.

27:15.176 --> 27:17.337
He won't struggle when I've
finished crippling him.

27:19.472 --> 27:23.385
My entire life, on every
assignment, every
transport ship,

27:23.476 --> 27:27.139
I scanned the soldiers,
looking for a face I'd
only ever seen once.

27:31.275 --> 27:34.984
Officer Sun, do you actually
believe I care what you think?

27:35.071 --> 27:37.187
Your sentiment disgusts me.

27:37.281 --> 27:41.320
I have not wasted a microt of
my life thinking about you.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.366
You're ashamed of me?

27:43.454 --> 27:44.569
You, a traitor?

27:44.664 --> 27:46.655
An enemy to everything you
were bred for?

27:46.749 --> 27:49.661
The Peacekeepers made me
the enemy that I am.

27:51.379 --> 27:52.835
Look at what you are doing.

27:52.922 --> 27:56.289
You are butchering this
magnificent creature
in its sleep.

27:56.384 --> 27:57.794
When it wakes,
it will be a slave

27:57.885 --> 28:01.127
and there is no guarantee it
will survive the procedure.

28:01.222 --> 28:03.634
You are pathetic.
You are not my daughter.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.339
lam.

28:05.434 --> 28:08.050
You made me very aware of that
the night you came to me
when l was a child

28:08.145 --> 28:10.136
and you told me what
you'd done.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.768
Which, may I remind you,
was not regulation.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.817
I never came to you.
You only dreamt it.

28:15.903 --> 28:18.861
Oh well, for many cycles
I believed that.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.859
But you see, I now have
a vid recording,

28:20.950 --> 28:24.238
which I would be happy to show
you if you'd like to see it.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.114
Or are you ashamed of
your sentiment?

28:26.205 --> 28:28.617
Yes I am, and I paid for it.

28:29.876 --> 28:33.334
My superior officers knew I
visited you that night.

28:33.421 --> 28:36.208
They interrogated me and
l professed my...

28:36.299 --> 28:38.915
attraction for a certain
Peacekeeper officer.

28:39.010 --> 28:39.965
My father.

28:40.052 --> 28:42.259
Yes. Talyn.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.132
He was older than I was.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.885
No longer as effective
in battle.

28:46.976 --> 28:49.638
But my superiors didn't
want to lose me.

28:49.729 --> 28:53.347
So, they gave me a chance
to redeem myself.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.565
What did you do to
redeem yourself?

29:00.323 --> 29:03.235
How did you redeem yourself?

29:03.326 --> 29:05.658
By killing your father.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.419
( sniffing )

29:22.428 --> 29:24.339
I found the scent again.

29:28.476 --> 29:31.468
Ah... At last.

29:34.607 --> 29:36.017
Wait.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.973
This could be a trap.

29:38.069 --> 29:39.900
The other might still be near.

29:39.987 --> 29:41.852
Do you smell him?

29:41.948 --> 29:44.439
( sniffing )

29:46.953 --> 29:48.489
No.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.580
Captain Bialar Crais.

29:52.667 --> 29:55.750
Or should I say,
former Captain Crais?

29:55.836 --> 30:02.833
Do you have any idea how many
Inquisitors want you back
in High Command?

30:02.927 --> 30:08.047
Our orders are to take
you in alive,

30:08.140 --> 30:10.597
but half alive is still...

30:10.685 --> 30:13.392
Wait! There's...
| smell something.

30:14.271 --> 30:15.260
Yes.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.401
( screaming )

30:26.450 --> 30:28.361
( screams )

30:31.706 --> 30:33.367
Hey, hey, Crais!

30:33.457 --> 30:35.368
Couldn't have done it
without ya.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.704
Why didn't you tell me?

30:37.795 --> 30:40.628
Needed your fear, homeboy.
I needed the sweat.

30:40.715 --> 30:43.297
I've served my purpose as your
lure. Now untie me.

30:43.384 --> 30:45.420
You don't get it, do you?

30:46.220 --> 30:48.586
Ain't no way, son.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.093
You stuck the knife in
one time too many.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.390
What, are you just going to
leave me like this?

30:53.477 --> 30:55.342
Well, you earned it.

30:55.438 --> 30:58.680
If you're going to
execute me, execute me.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.310
Kill me.

31:00.401 --> 31:02.562
But don't leave me here to die!

31:02.653 --> 31:04.189
You lied to us!

31:04.280 --> 31:05.895
You betrayed us and
you used us!

31:05.990 --> 31:10.450
I used all my assets to stay
alive, and those assets
were you.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.369
You think of your own
survival now.

31:13.456 --> 31:14.536
What if Aeryn is dead?

31:14.623 --> 31:15.658
She's not.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.160
What if she is?

31:17.251 --> 31:19.207
How are you going to
command Talyn?

31:19.295 --> 31:22.332
How are you going to get off
this planet without me?

31:22.423 --> 31:25.130
And what if Aeryn isn't back at
Talyn when you get there?

31:25.217 --> 31:27.048
What are you going to do then?

31:35.061 --> 31:36.551
(grunting)

31:48.407 --> 31:50.147
What about Rygel. Is he dead?

31:50.242 --> 31:53.734
He died for several microts,
but I managed to get his little
heart beating again.

31:53.829 --> 31:57.492
Then I sewed the wound
closed with the vines.
The restorative vines.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.791
But... I'm no diagnosan.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.914
I don't know what else to do.

32:07.510 --> 32:11.423
She doesn't know it yet,
but Talyn is almost recovered.

32:11.514 --> 32:14.221
All we have to do is wait
till he wakes up.

32:14.308 --> 32:16.390
He's not going to wake up.

32:25.319 --> 32:26.934
Aeryn.

32:27.029 --> 32:28.565
Wake up, Aeryn.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.281
Aeryn...

32:35.496 --> 32:38.078
My name is Xhalax Sun.

32:38.165 --> 32:40.998
The night you've so
conveniently forgotten.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.079
I'm your mother.

32:43.170 --> 32:47.755
You mustn't reveal to anyone
that I was here.
Do you understand?

32:47.842 --> 32:50.174
I came to tell you something.

32:50.427 --> 32:52.509
Aeryn,

32:52.596 --> 32:55.759
your life was not an accident.

32:55.850 --> 33:02.267
You cared enough then to risk
everything, to meet the child
that you had conceived.

33:02.356 --> 33:06.474
You can't have burned that
love away completely.

33:06.569 --> 33:10.653
Talyn, that's your
father's name.

33:12.241 --> 33:15.199
He and I chose to have you.

33:15.286 --> 33:18.244
You were conceived in love.

33:19.123 --> 33:21.239
Our love.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.994
lam that child.

33:23.085 --> 33:24.450
I am part of you.

33:24.545 --> 33:26.251
I am part of Talyn.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.715
I wanted you to know this.

33:28.799 --> 33:32.257
Peacekeeper way isn't
the only way.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.130
It's not too late for you.

33:34.221 --> 33:36.382
It makes you special.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.511
We wanted you.

33:40.603 --> 33:42.093
No!

33:49.486 --> 33:51.738
This is dead history!

33:51.822 --> 33:54.063
Your father is dead!

33:54.867 --> 33:56.198
And you...

33:56.285 --> 33:59.243
you will face a
Peacekeeper Tribunal,

33:59.330 --> 34:02.242
on a charge of high treason.

34:16.931 --> 34:18.467
( growls softly )

34:20.517 --> 34:21.973
( groans )

34:22.061 --> 34:23.722
(grunts)

34:39.828 --> 34:41.034
Rygel!

34:42.331 --> 34:45.164
I've been filleted.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.912
The restorative vines.
They're working!

34:47.002 --> 34:49.163
Rygel, come over here
now and untie us!

34:49.713 --> 34:51.089
Get over there?

34:51.173 --> 34:55.382
I need bed rest for at least
the next 50 arns!

34:56.845 --> 34:59.552
Oh! Oh!

34:59.640 --> 35:02.302
Have you seen these
so-called stitches?

35:02.393 --> 35:03.929
Who did this to me?

35:04.019 --> 35:05.179
Idid.

35:05.271 --> 35:09.856
Oh, great. A one-eyed hingmot
with no 3-D vision.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.148
Oh! Oh!

35:11.235 --> 35:15.194
How many of my vital organs
did you puncture?!

35:15.281 --> 35:17.192
I saved your life!

35:17.283 --> 35:19.114
Saved my life!

35:19.827 --> 35:21.192
Look!

35:22.830 --> 35:25.242
You sewed this to me!

35:25.332 --> 35:26.037
Rygel...

35:26.125 --> 35:27.581
My robes!

35:27.668 --> 35:30.626
You sewed my robes to my chest!

35:30.713 --> 35:32.328
Get over here, now!

35:43.976 --> 35:45.591
Is this thing working?

35:47.271 --> 35:48.511
It had better be.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.812
We'll never find Talyn
without it.

35:54.028 --> 35:57.987
Oh, for frell's sake, Rygel.
Use two hands. Two hands.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.450
I'm going as fast as I can!

36:00.534 --> 36:03.492
My robes are stitched inside
my chest cavity.

36:03.579 --> 36:05.444
You are so ungrateful.

36:05.539 --> 36:11.000
And I'm trying to keep my guts
from spilling out all over
this frelling floor!

36:21.221 --> 36:23.132
Right. See if you
can wake Talyn.

36:23.223 --> 36:26.636
If he's up to it, when I get
back, we're going.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.680
Come on.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.352
Come on!

36:32.274 --> 36:34.185
C-come on!

36:48.624 --> 36:50.364
( hissing softly)

37:02.262 --> 37:05.345
We've been here.
That's old faithful.
We must be near Talyn.

37:05.432 --> 37:06.842
(yells)

37:38.841 --> 37:40.377
Aeryn?

37:49.435 --> 37:53.269
I would take you back, attempt
to redeem you if it
was possible.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.392
But your corruption is
too advanced!

37:56.483 --> 37:58.860
My corruption began the moment
I was conceived!

37:58.944 --> 37:59.694
No!

37:59.778 --> 38:01.359
Watch the teeth!

38:03.198 --> 38:05.780
Don't you see my independence
comes from you anyway?

38:05.868 --> 38:08.484
I grew up wanting to be just
like a woman I'd only seen once.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.160
You are a traitor!

38:10.247 --> 38:12.283
(roaring)

38:15.294 --> 38:18.252
I am the part of you that
wanted to be a rebel,

38:18.338 --> 38:21.125
the part of you that knew deep
down inside what was right.
-Shut up!

38:21.216 --> 38:23.548
You've resisted Peacekeeper
doctrine before.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.420
Shut up!

38:24.511 --> 38:26.126
Why can't you do it again now?

38:26.221 --> 38:29.179
You are an aberration!

38:29.266 --> 38:30.221
lam your child!

38:30.309 --> 38:31.890
(grunts)

38:37.608 --> 38:40.065
Right, John, get out
of the way.

38:41.361 --> 38:42.817
Let her do it.
Let her shoot me!

38:42.905 --> 38:44.236
No, Aeryn, don't kill her!

38:44.323 --> 38:45.733
We have to.
-You can't.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.610
There's been too much killing!

38:47.701 --> 38:50.613
No. We let her live, she comes,
she hunts us down again.

38:50.704 --> 38:52.990
Aeryn, you should not be
the one to do this!

38:53.081 --> 38:54.696
She can't do it!

38:55.209 --> 38:57.370
She's afraid.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.539
Aeryn, please.
Put the gun away.

39:00.631 --> 39:01.996
Crais:
You're wrong.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.341
Aeryn is right.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.507
We must not let Xhalax live.

39:05.594 --> 39:08.256
Officer Sun knows Peacekeeper
regulations.

39:08.347 --> 39:11.214
If we don't kill Xhalax,
she will come after us again.

39:11.308 --> 39:14.596
Aeryn is not going to be the
one to kill her mother!

39:17.814 --> 39:19.896
You want her dead?

39:19.983 --> 39:21.234
Fine, you do it!

39:21.318 --> 39:22.558
As you wish.

39:22.653 --> 39:24.814
Somebody must do it.

39:24.905 --> 39:27.271
Go. Go now. You must not
witness this.

39:28.367 --> 39:31.200
Coward! She can't kill me.

39:36.917 --> 39:39.249
I am right, aren't I?

39:39.336 --> 39:43.045
We let you live, you come
and you find us again.

39:43.757 --> 39:46.214
What, do you expect me to lie?

39:50.097 --> 39:52.179
Crais is right.

39:52.266 --> 39:54.928
I will hunt you down and
I will kill you.

40:08.824 --> 40:10.564
Goodbye, Mother.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.076
Aeryn, you have to go.

40:31.722 --> 40:33.758
Go on. Do it.

40:35.350 --> 40:36.965
Do it.

41:02.294 --> 41:03.955
No.

41:05.339 --> 41:08.422
( gunshots )

41:51.009 --> 41:53.250
Your recovery is truly
a miracle.

41:53.345 --> 41:57.008
If I don't die of hekpus from
these threads in my chest!

41:57.099 --> 41:58.384
Don't move!

41:58.475 --> 41:59.715
Let me see!

41:59.810 --> 42:02.847
(groaning)

42:02.938 --> 42:04.894
That's done it.

42:04.981 --> 42:06.266
Does it look all right?

42:06.358 --> 42:09.100
You're... you're as handsome
as you ever were.

42:09.194 --> 42:13.733
And, all things considered, you
know, Rygel, you're luckyjust
to be alive again.

42:13.824 --> 42:15.610
Alive again?

42:15.701 --> 42:18.192
Yes. For a while there,
you were dead.

42:18.286 --> 42:19.537
No!

42:19.621 --> 42:21.486
Yes.

42:21.581 --> 42:26.996
And when I joined with you,
to bring you back,
I met with Zhaan.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.202
Zhaan?

42:28.296 --> 42:30.127
Yes.

42:30.215 --> 42:33.298
That's why you stitched the
frelling tunic to my chest.

42:33.385 --> 42:35.296
You were busy hallucinating.

42:35.387 --> 42:39.221
She looked contented.

42:40.392 --> 42:41.723
She whispered to me.

42:41.810 --> 42:44.643
Kala... Kalash atir...

42:44.730 --> 42:47.346
Kalash atir maz.

42:47.441 --> 42:48.226
What?

42:48.316 --> 42:50.181
It is a prayer of guardianship.

42:50.277 --> 42:53.269
It means she is
watching over us.

42:54.281 --> 42:56.442
Kala... Kalash atir...

42:56.533 --> 42:59.195
Kalash atir maz.

43:00.704 --> 43:03.195
( squeaking softly )

43:03.290 --> 43:05.121
Mmm.

43:06.251 --> 43:08.333
( chuckles )

43:21.433 --> 43:23.344
How is he?

43:25.562 --> 43:29.475
Aeryn:
Crais is attempting to splice
his neural engrams with Talyn's.

43:29.566 --> 43:35.732
And if he can, then Talyn
will be able to navigate
on his own once again

43:35.822 --> 43:38.279
and we can get some sleep.

43:40.994 --> 43:42.655
Or not.

43:44.790 --> 43:47.122
You don't have to wait up for
me if you don't want to.

43:47.209 --> 43:49.291
No, I don't mind.

43:52.839 --> 43:55.251
It is all we can do.

43:56.384 --> 43:58.170
Yeah.

43:58.261 --> 44:02.800
It's just a large part of
Crais's psyche will now
reside in Talyn.

44:06.603 --> 44:09.640
It's the only way to bring
Talyn back to life.

44:12.359 --> 44:14.395
My...

44:14.486 --> 44:19.480
Xhalax was my last connection
to the Peacekeepers.

44:23.620 --> 44:27.204
All my ties to them are now
completely severed.

44:35.924 --> 44:37.664
I know.
