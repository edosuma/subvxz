WEBVTT

00:03.009 --> 00:05.019
[theme music]

00:07.089 --> 00:10.119
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:10.140 --> 00:13.220
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.210
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:16.230 --> 00:18.230
They were good.

00:19.010 --> 00:21.140
[theme music]

00:24.120 --> 00:28.129
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:28.149 --> 00:29.219
He was bad.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.049
Oh, I hate Smurfs.

00:33.140 --> 00:36.020
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:36.039 --> 00:38.119
if it's the last thing
I ever do!

00:38.140 --> 00:40.140
[evil laughter]

00:40.159 --> 00:41.140
Unh!

00:41.159 --> 00:43.109
Oh, I'll get you.

00:43.130 --> 00:46.200
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:46.219 --> 00:49.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there

00:49.049 --> 00:53.079
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.200
And if you are good,
you may just

00:55.219 --> 00:59.000
catch a glimpse of the Smurfs.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.170
[theme music]

01:12.150 --> 01:15.010
Uh, I reckon
this be the worst drought

01:15.030 --> 01:17.129
in a smurfy long time.

01:19.090 --> 01:22.140
The heat be wilting my brain
as well as my cabbage.

01:29.060 --> 01:31.210
[sighs]
At least it can't get any worse.

01:36.099 --> 01:37.159
What a day.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.079
I'm ready to...melt.

01:40.099 --> 01:44.229
[sighs]
Yeah, and it's even
too hot to sleep.

01:45.009 --> 01:46.090
[snores]

01:46.109 --> 01:50.129
Worst of all,
it's too hot to eat...almost.

01:52.039 --> 01:55.000
I know how to beat this heat.

01:55.020 --> 01:57.210
I'll make a big pitcher
of smurfberry juice

01:57.229 --> 02:00.090
and I won't share it
with anybody.

02:00.109 --> 02:02.030
[Brainy giggles]

02:02.049 --> 02:04.030
Oh, no.

02:04.049 --> 02:06.040
'No smurfberries?'

02:06.060 --> 02:09.169
And no smurfberries
means no smurfberry juice.

02:09.189 --> 02:12.169
If this formula works,
it will enlarge

02:12.189 --> 02:14.210
little clouds
into big clouds.

02:14.229 --> 02:17.170
Then we'll have rain at last.

02:17.189 --> 02:18.219
Oops.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.139
[crackling]

02:22.150 --> 02:24.229
[spider screeches]

02:25.009 --> 02:26.030
Uh-oh.

02:26.050 --> 02:30.050
Easy, fella. He he he.
Uh, down boy.

02:30.069 --> 02:32.210
Wait. Uh, hold it. Stop!

02:32.229 --> 02:36.050
If I can just reach
the elfin root, I..

02:36.069 --> 02:38.020
[Papa Smurf grunts]

02:40.030 --> 02:41.090
[slurping]

02:44.110 --> 02:47.219
Well, my enlarging mixture
certainly works.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.129
Now to use it on the clouds.

02:49.150 --> 02:52.139
Wow! I'll bet that mixture
would smurf up

02:52.159 --> 02:55.189
some big fat
smurfberries real fast.

02:58.090 --> 03:01.219
I'll just mix up
a teeny, tiny bit.

03:02.000 --> 03:06.180
Ooh, Hefty, you sure are nice
to carry all these heavy rocks

03:06.199 --> 03:10.060
out of my garden,
especially in this heat.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.120
[Hefty grunts]

03:11.139 --> 03:14.219
- There.
- Ooh, you're so strong.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.069
If I had done that,
I'd just collapse.

03:18.090 --> 03:19.150
Bye now.

03:19.170 --> 03:21.050
[groans]

03:24.189 --> 03:27.189
[giggles]
Smurfberry juice
will soon be a reality

03:27.210 --> 03:30.000
and it will all be mine.

03:30.020 --> 03:31.069
Oh!

03:31.090 --> 03:32.099
Oof.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.189
Now I'll have to go
and mix up some more.

03:41.129 --> 03:43.189
Hey, what happened?

03:43.210 --> 03:46.189
Uh, maybe it's the heat,
and I'm just dreaming.

03:47.180 --> 03:48.150
Ohh!

03:48.170 --> 03:50.099
[stammers]
It's no dream.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.039
[gasps]
Papa Smurf!

03:53.060 --> 03:55.099
Now, how did I do this?

03:55.120 --> 03:57.129
"A dash of dandelion dust.

03:57.150 --> 04:00.030
A touch of tree-toad sweat."

04:00.050 --> 04:01.129
[rumbling]

04:01.150 --> 04:04.069
[all yelling]

04:04.090 --> 04:05.189
Papa Smurf!

04:05.210 --> 04:07.050
'Papa Smurf!'

04:07.069 --> 04:09.129
Uh-oh, somebody's coming.

04:09.150 --> 04:12.080
(Hefty Smurf)
'Papa Smurf, it's me, Hefty.'

04:12.099 --> 04:14.000
'Please open up.'

04:14.020 --> 04:17.189
Ahem. Hefty, there is no need
to make such a big..

04:17.209 --> 04:20.160
Big. Big. Big!

04:20.180 --> 04:22.209
[screams]

04:22.230 --> 04:25.029
He's a m-monster.

04:25.050 --> 04:27.120
Quick, Brainy,
where's Papa Smurf?

04:27.139 --> 04:30.000
He's gotta help me.

04:30.019 --> 04:34.139
I was just resting at the bottom
of Smurfberry Hill and--

04:34.159 --> 04:36.110
Smurfberry Hill?

04:36.129 --> 04:40.040
Yeah, and all of a sudden
this stuff fell on me and--

04:40.060 --> 04:43.000
Stuff? Like p-p-powder?

04:43.019 --> 04:45.060
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

04:45.079 --> 04:47.110
And I have to tell Papa Smurf

04:47.129 --> 04:50.120
so he can shrink me
back to normal.

04:50.139 --> 04:53.129
Wait. There's no need
to tell P-Papa Smurf.

04:53.149 --> 04:55.189
- Huh?
- I mean, uh..

04:55.209 --> 04:58.050
Look around you.

04:58.069 --> 05:01.000
'Now you can do things the rest
of us can only dream of.'

05:01.019 --> 05:02.209
'Right, Smurfs? Hee-hee.'

05:02.230 --> 05:04.160
- Uh, yeah.
- He's right.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.170
Why, you're the strongest smurf
in the world.

05:07.189 --> 05:11.040
Hey, that's true.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.199
I'll bet I can clean
all the rocks

05:12.220 --> 05:15.129
out of Smurfette's garden
in a flash.

05:17.060 --> 05:19.170
No, Hefty. Wait. My garden.

05:19.189 --> 05:22.009
Oh, don't worry, Smurfette.

05:22.029 --> 05:25.170
It's no big thing
when you're a big Smurf.

05:25.189 --> 05:28.170
Brainy, how did
all this get started?

05:28.189 --> 05:32.029
It, um, does pose
a mystery, doesn't it?

05:32.050 --> 05:33.100
Ha, ha.. Ouch!

05:33.120 --> 05:37.139
There, Smurfette.
How's that?

05:37.159 --> 05:39.220
Hey, that's my house.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.180
Oops. Ha!

05:41.199 --> 05:44.100
I guess I don't
know my own strength.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.009
[laughs]

05:46.029 --> 05:47.050
[crying]

05:49.090 --> 05:52.000
Ooh. We better
go get Papa Smurf.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.220
Wait. Um, um..

05:54.000 --> 05:56.100
Papa Smurf's off
on important business

05:56.120 --> 05:59.199
and we shouldn't bother him
with our little problems.

05:59.220 --> 06:01.220
Little problems?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.060
And now..

06:03.079 --> 06:06.209
...I'm gonna do something
I always wanted to do.

06:06.230 --> 06:09.129
I'm gonna capture Gargamel.

06:09.149 --> 06:11.230
(Smurfs)
'Oh, no.'

06:12.009 --> 06:14.060
Hefty, wait.

06:14.079 --> 06:16.040
Oh, please don't do this, Hefty.

06:16.060 --> 06:19.069
- Gargamel's dangerous.
- Not anymore.

06:19.089 --> 06:21.139
'He's about to meet his match.'

06:21.160 --> 06:23.089
'Me.'

06:25.050 --> 06:27.110
(Brainy Smurf)
Oh!

06:27.129 --> 06:30.110
So don't you Smurfs worry
about a thing.

06:30.129 --> 06:32.129
I know exactly what I'm doing.

06:32.149 --> 06:35.230
That does it.
I'm going to get Papa Smurf.

06:36.009 --> 06:38.100
[all clamoring]

06:38.120 --> 06:42.149
[gulps]
I've created a monster.

06:42.170 --> 06:44.230
(Gargamel)
'Oh, I hate
this kind of weather.'

06:45.009 --> 06:48.079
'Sunny, bright, cheerful.'

06:48.100 --> 06:50.120
The kind of day
when those rotten Smurfs

06:50.139 --> 06:53.069
have lots of fun. Yuck!

06:53.090 --> 06:56.079
'If I could get my hands
on just one of those vile'

06:56.100 --> 06:58.050
despicable little creatures

06:58.069 --> 07:01.079
I'd wipe the grin
off his little blue face.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.110
[Azrael yowling]

07:02.129 --> 07:04.060
Oh, let go, fur brain.

07:04.079 --> 07:05.189
I've told you
not to interrupt me

07:05.209 --> 07:08.100
when I'm feeling
sorry for myself.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.160
[gasps]

07:10.180 --> 07:13.060
What's this?
I must be dreaming.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.189
[instrumental music]

07:18.009 --> 07:20.000
[Azrael mews]

07:20.019 --> 07:22.129
End of the line, Gargamel.

07:22.149 --> 07:27.120
Smurf, you may be big,
but I'm still bigger.

07:27.139 --> 07:28.209
[laughs]

07:28.230 --> 07:30.060
So what?

07:30.079 --> 07:32.199
I gotcha.

07:32.220 --> 07:35.000
[giggles]

07:35.019 --> 07:37.019
Why, you impudent little--

07:37.040 --> 07:40.009
Crying won't help,
so save your breath.

07:40.029 --> 07:44.009
I'm taking you back
to the village as my prisoner.

07:44.029 --> 07:45.100
That's what you..

07:45.120 --> 07:47.180
[stammers]
Your.. Your village?

07:47.199 --> 07:50.139
You heard me. Now march.

07:50.159 --> 07:53.209
Hmm. Oh. Oh, you've got me.

07:53.230 --> 07:56.060
Oh, please,
please don't hurt me.

07:56.079 --> 07:57.100
Huh?

07:57.120 --> 07:59.009
Oh, I hope I can free myself

07:59.029 --> 08:03.029
before he grabs that even
bigger net on the wall.

08:06.089 --> 08:07.230
Now I got you both.

08:08.009 --> 08:11.000
(Gargamel)
Oh, you certainly do.

08:11.019 --> 08:12.189
[Azrael mewing]

08:12.209 --> 08:15.050
Psst! Azrael, play along.

08:15.069 --> 08:18.120
This is our free ticket
into the Smurf Village.

08:18.139 --> 08:19.199
Huh?

08:22.079 --> 08:24.069
- Oh!
- Oh!

08:24.089 --> 08:26.060
[both laughing]

08:28.029 --> 08:29.149
The catapult's ready,
Papa Smurf.

08:29.170 --> 08:33.049
Alright, Handy. Now let's see
if we can enlarge these clouds

08:33.070 --> 08:35.039
enough to bring some rain.

08:35.058 --> 08:37.070
(Smurfette)
Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

08:37.090 --> 08:39.070
Oh, Papa Smurf, come quick.

08:39.090 --> 08:41.029
Smurfette, what's wrong?

08:41.049 --> 08:43.090
Hefty's grown into a giant and--

08:43.110 --> 08:44.230
- A giant?
- Yes.

08:45.009 --> 08:47.100
And now he's gone
to capture Gargamel.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.129
It sounds like someone's
been smurfing

08:49.149 --> 08:51.110
with my enlarging formula.

08:51.129 --> 08:53.129
Quickly, to the village.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.220
Oh, smurf is me.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.230
This is terrible.
And it's all my fault.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.230
Your fault?

09:04.009 --> 09:06.070
- 'So that's it.'
- 'I should've known.'

09:06.090 --> 09:08.169
Wait till Papa Smurf finds out.

09:08.190 --> 09:10.080
(Hefty Smurf)
'Hey, Smurfs.'

09:10.100 --> 09:13.210
'Your problems are over.
Look what I got.'

09:15.009 --> 09:16.039
[all gasp]

09:16.059 --> 09:19.110
(Smurfs)
Gargamel. Azrael.

09:19.129 --> 09:21.080
(Hefty Smurf)
'There's nothing to fear.'

09:21.100 --> 09:25.039
I've single-handedly captured
them, once and for all.

09:25.059 --> 09:26.220
(Gargamel)
'That's what you think.'

09:27.000 --> 09:29.070
Oh, gonna be difficult, huh?

09:29.090 --> 09:31.149
Well, I'm gonna smurf you
a lesson you'll never..

09:31.169 --> 09:32.200
[Hefty gulps]

09:32.220 --> 09:36.059
'Hey, no fair.
Put me down, buster.'

09:36.080 --> 09:38.059
[laughs]

09:38.080 --> 09:40.129
Now to get the rest
of them, Azrael.

09:40.149 --> 09:41.200
[Gargamel laughs]

09:41.220 --> 09:43.169
[Azrael mews]

09:46.220 --> 09:49.159
Oh, Papa Smurf,
what are we gonna do?

09:49.179 --> 09:52.009
This mixture caused
our problems

09:52.029 --> 09:54.029
but maybe it can
also solve them.

09:54.049 --> 09:56.070
My little smurfs,
we'll have to work fast.

09:56.090 --> 09:57.210
Here's what I want you to do.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.210
[laughs]

09:59.230 --> 10:02.179
At last you're mine.
All of you!

10:02.200 --> 10:04.059
[laughs]

10:04.080 --> 10:07.029
(Clumsy Smurf)
Uh.. Oh, Azrael.

10:07.049 --> 10:09.090
Nah, nah-nah, nah-nah, nah.

10:09.110 --> 10:11.039
[snarls]

10:11.059 --> 10:12.129
[growling]

10:14.070 --> 10:17.179
Yoo-hoo, over here.
Bet you can't catch us.

10:18.080 --> 10:19.149
[hissing]

10:20.059 --> 10:22.120
[snarling]

10:25.159 --> 10:27.029
[panting]

10:27.049 --> 10:29.149
Ooh, they're making
a fool of you, Azrael.

10:29.169 --> 10:32.179
'Can't you catch
those puny little pea brains?'

10:32.200 --> 10:35.110
[panting]

10:37.090 --> 10:40.190
Azrael. Here we are.

10:40.210 --> 10:43.059
[snarling]

10:43.080 --> 10:45.049
Ready, smurfs? Jump.

10:45.070 --> 10:47.139
[snarling]

10:47.159 --> 10:50.169
Azrael! You let them
outsmart you.

10:50.190 --> 10:53.190
You're a miserable
fur-brained failure.

10:55.230 --> 10:59.110
Such clumsy incompetence
will not go unpunished, Azrael.

10:59.129 --> 11:01.169
Therefore, I have
decided to keep

11:01.190 --> 11:03.159
all of these smurfs for myself.

11:03.179 --> 11:06.029
[Azrael growling]

11:06.049 --> 11:08.179
[gasps]
Azrael, wh-wh-what..

11:08.200 --> 11:10.139
[growling]

11:12.210 --> 11:15.200
Now, now, Azrael.
Ha-ha, I was only joking.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.100
[chuckles]
I'll-I'll..

11:17.120 --> 11:18.220
I'll let you have
a few of the Smurfs.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.169
Uh-uh, lots of the Smurfs.

11:22.190 --> 11:25.039
Uh, heh, all of the Smurfs?

11:25.059 --> 11:27.019
- Yipe!
- Whoa!

11:27.039 --> 11:29.000
[Azrael growling]

11:29.019 --> 11:30.080
[all laughing]

11:30.100 --> 11:32.009
(Gargamel)
'Ouch. Yike. Ooh.'

11:32.029 --> 11:35.019
Oh, I didn't mean it, Azrael.
I didn't. I was only joking.

11:35.039 --> 11:38.049
Ha-ha-ha!
See, I-I'm laughing.

11:38.070 --> 11:40.049
[Azrael growling]

11:40.070 --> 11:43.009
But I may start crying soon.

11:46.220 --> 11:49.009
[all cheering]

11:49.029 --> 11:51.200
Hefty, a little
of this elfin root

11:51.220 --> 11:54.090
should bring things
back to normal.

11:54.110 --> 11:56.120
Phew! Thanks, Papa Smurf.

11:56.139 --> 11:58.139
Being big was okay for a while.

11:58.159 --> 12:00.210
But it can get lonely
at the top.

12:00.230 --> 12:03.149
[all laughing]

12:03.169 --> 12:07.080
As for Azrael, in time
the mixture will wear off

12:07.100 --> 12:09.080
but not before
he's chased Gargamel

12:09.100 --> 12:12.139
too far away to ever
find the village again.

12:12.159 --> 12:16.059
And now it's time
to clean up this mess.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.220
Brainy?

12:18.000 --> 12:22.009
Yes, sir, Papa Smurf.
Right here, Papa Smurf.

12:22.029 --> 12:23.169
Um, er, uh..

12:23.190 --> 12:26.080
Papa Smurf, being
cleverly brilliant

12:26.100 --> 12:29.029
couldn't you just sort of
whip up a cleaning potion

12:29.049 --> 12:31.000
that I could use instead?

12:31.019 --> 12:32.210
Another potion?

12:32.230 --> 12:35.080
- Oh, no.
- No potions.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.120
(Hefty Smurf)
'How dare you, Brainy Smurf?'

12:37.139 --> 12:39.090
J-j-just kidding.

12:39.110 --> 12:42.169
Help. Papa Smurf. Help!

12:42.190 --> 12:47.159
[giggles]
I think the first thing Brainy
has to clean up is his act.

12:47.179 --> 12:49.019
[giggles]

12:49.039 --> 12:50.080
Smurfette, heh

12:50.100 --> 12:53.120
I think
you're absosmurfly right.

12:53.139 --> 12:56.100
(Brainy Smurf)
Help! Help!

12:56.120 --> 12:58.100
Help!

13:00.120 --> 13:02.120
[theme music]
