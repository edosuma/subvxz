00:00.106 --> 00:01.881
_

00:01.882 --> 00:03.286
I love you.

00:04.006 --> 00:06.603
How do you know which one is the one?

00:06.603 --> 00:08.748
It's simple. It's the kiss.

00:08.748 --> 00:09.829
(Gasps)

00:11.513 --> 00:14.205
Cooper moved in upstairs,
and now I'm starting

00:14.206 --> 00:16.488
to feel things for Josh downstairs.

00:16.488 --> 00:17.659
Oh, my damn.

00:17.659 --> 00:20.642
Josh... it's you.

00:20.642 --> 00:23.825
Gabi, before you fall for
Josh's big "I love you,"

00:23.859 --> 00:26.337
you should know that he thought
he loved you three months ago.

00:26.337 --> 00:29.564
And then when he changed his mind,
convinced everyone to lie to you about it.

00:29.598 --> 00:30.578
Is that true?

00:30.579 --> 00:32.603
- Gabi, I can explain everything.
- Oh, my God, it is true.

00:32.604 --> 00:34.869
- Gabi, wait.
- No, get the hell away from me.

00:39.149 --> 00:41.309
Gabi, are you in here?

00:46.448 --> 00:49.984
- Damn it. Oh, my God!
- (Screams)

00:50.019 --> 00:53.288
Don't scare me like that! I
almost went lil' so-so on your ass.

00:55.891 --> 00:59.192
Gabi, we need to talk. I sent
you, like, a thousand texts.

00:59.192 --> 01:01.002
Well, then you added insult to injury

01:01.002 --> 01:02.802
because I don't have unlimited texting.

01:03.421 --> 01:06.359
Gabi, I wanted to tell you about
Josh the second that I found out.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.529
But you seemed so happy with Cooper,
I just... I didn't have the heart.

01:09.535 --> 01:12.753
Oh, so you admit you have no heart.

01:13.464 --> 01:16.063
Look, you have every right
to be mad at me. Okay?

01:16.063 --> 01:17.534
Even though my intentions were good,

01:17.534 --> 01:20.106
it was stupid and I
take full responsibility.

01:20.107 --> 01:22.903
And maybe you should take some
responsibility for how you've been acting.

01:22.903 --> 01:23.751
What?

01:24.181 --> 01:26.118
You should take some responsibility

01:26.118 --> 01:27.689
for how you've been acting.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.762
How I've been acting?

01:30.480 --> 01:32.882
"I love Josh. No, I love Cooper.

01:32.882 --> 01:34.667
"He's the one. No, he's the one.

01:34.668 --> 01:36.239
I have two ones."

01:37.365 --> 01:39.367
Okay, first of all, that
sounds nothing like me.

01:39.368 --> 01:40.699
- And second of all...
- (Knock on door)

01:40.700 --> 01:42.439
You need to get rid of
whoever is at that door.

01:42.439 --> 01:44.764
Okay. From now on, I got your back.

01:47.033 --> 01:48.207
- Is she here?
- Nope!

01:48.207 --> 01:49.864
- I know she's here.
- How?

01:49.864 --> 01:51.179
I see her.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.649
- Gabi, we need to talk.
- No. No more talking, no more drama.

01:54.649 --> 01:56.764
- What I need is for this night to end.
- (Knock on door)

01:56.765 --> 01:58.564
That is not the sound of ending!

02:00.374 --> 02:02.713
- Gabi, we need to talk.
- For three months,

02:02.713 --> 02:05.700
none of you said a word to me.
And now none of you can shut up!

02:06.523 --> 02:07.712
You hear that, Cooper?

02:08.181 --> 02:10.773
She doesn't want to talk
to you. So buh-bye now.

02:10.773 --> 02:12.367
Don't buh-bye me. Buh-bye you.

02:12.403 --> 02:13.219
(Gabi Gasps)

02:13.469 --> 02:15.114
- Hey, back off.
- You back off.

02:15.115 --> 02:17.340
Hey! What is wrong with you two?

02:18.440 --> 02:20.108
I'm sorry, that was out of line.

02:20.142 --> 02:21.316
It was.

02:22.077 --> 02:23.911
- So is this.
- What the hell?

02:23.946 --> 02:26.080
(Gabi) Josh, stop!

02:26.115 --> 02:28.015
- Ow! Oh!
- (Gasps)

02:28.050 --> 02:30.242
Ow! Okay, that's it.

02:30.243 --> 02:32.432
(Gabi gasps) Oh my God, you guys, stop!

02:32.432 --> 02:34.324
- Not the blender!
- Oh, my God!

02:34.325 --> 02:36.362
- (Screaming)
- Ah!

02:36.363 --> 02:39.660
- (Screaming)
- Stop! Stop! Stop!

02:39.695 --> 02:41.948
- (All shouting)
- (Sofia) Not the votives!

02:42.161 --> 02:44.980
Hey! Hey! Stop!

02:45.636 --> 02:48.468
Oh, my God! Okay, you need
to stop fighting, all right?

02:48.468 --> 02:50.798
Because you're bad at
it, and it's embarrassing!

02:52.141 --> 02:53.737
I can't take this anymore. Okay?

02:53.737 --> 02:55.945
I'm... I'm done. I'm done with both of you.

02:55.946 --> 02:57.465
All right? You need to get out.

03:04.244 --> 03:05.945
So I'll see you at work tomorrow?

03:05.979 --> 03:07.146
Yes, but I will be late.

Wake up, Gabi, 'cause your best
friend is taking you to breakfast at...

03:34.307 --> 03:36.208
- Good morning!
- Aah!

03:37.562 --> 03:39.969
You seem peppy. Why?

03:40.561 --> 03:43.560
Well, thanks to all the lies
and betrayal, I couldn't sleep.

03:43.561 --> 03:46.459
So I took one of those "What
am I doing with my life" walks,

03:46.460 --> 03:48.627
and I realized you were right.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.390
I've been acting like some
lovesick girl in a rom-com

03:50.390 --> 03:51.568
instead of following my dreams.

03:51.568 --> 03:54.059
I'm not Julia Roberts, I'm Julia Child.

03:54.094 --> 03:55.928
And then it hit me. D'Arby.

03:56.254 --> 03:58.446
The homeless guy with the
really high-pitched voice?

03:58.446 --> 04:00.332
No, no, no, that's Dabney.

04:00.367 --> 04:01.967
I'm talking about Charles D'Arby, he's

04:02.002 --> 04:03.649
one of the most famous
chefs in San Francisco.

04:03.650 --> 04:06.138
And every year, he has a contest
to find an apprentice to work

04:06.173 --> 04:09.308
at his Michelin-starred restaurant
in Switzerland, and I applied!

04:09.342 --> 04:12.111
(Laughs) "What about your
job with Josh," you ask?

04:12.145 --> 04:14.947
Well, I'm keeping it until
I get the apprenticeship,

04:14.981 --> 04:16.148
and I am getting it.

04:16.183 --> 04:17.950
I already submitted three original recipes,

04:17.983 --> 04:18.983
a personal statement,

04:19.019 --> 04:21.320
and three fake references.

04:21.353 --> 04:24.190
All I have left to do is make
a video of my knife skills.

04:24.224 --> 04:27.480
(Laughs) Man, I've had
a lot of coffee. Whoo!

04:33.300 --> 04:36.135
- Baby, I am so sorry.
- Not necessary.

04:36.169 --> 04:39.373
I am no longer angry with you
for lying to me about Josh.

04:39.373 --> 04:42.341
Because you were coerced
by him into deceiving me.

04:42.871 --> 04:44.944
And Elliot, I forgive you

04:44.978 --> 04:47.053
because you didn't really
betray me as a friend

04:47.054 --> 04:49.065
since you never really
liked me in the first place.

04:49.578 --> 04:51.083
That is so true.

04:52.572 --> 04:54.286
But the important thing is...

04:54.321 --> 04:57.690
I'm getting married,
and you're not invited.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.807
Yay!

05:01.628 --> 05:02.761
Did I hear Gabi?

05:05.174 --> 05:08.274
Hey, Yolanda, um, would
you mind giving us a minute?

05:08.275 --> 05:09.501
Josh, no, I don't want to talk.

05:09.536 --> 05:11.604
Yolanda, as my friend,
I'm asking you to stay.

05:11.638 --> 05:12.249
Oh, sure.

05:12.250 --> 05:13.781
Yolanda, as your boss,
I'm asking you to leave.

05:13.782 --> 05:15.692
- Yep.
- You owe me.

05:15.692 --> 05:17.409
(Clicks tongue)

05:17.444 --> 05:19.239
I pay you.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.308
Sorry, Gabi, monies before honeys.

05:25.111 --> 05:26.886
Gabi, we need to talk.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.088
Yes, we do. What would
you like for breakfast?

05:29.122 --> 05:31.942
I would like a delicious plate of
please sit down and listen to this.

05:31.942 --> 05:33.199
- Josh!
- Look, it's just a voice mail

05:33.200 --> 05:34.406
I want you to hear. That's it.

05:34.549 --> 05:35.556
Fine.

05:41.568 --> 05:43.502
(Josh on computer) <i>Last night
after I called off my wedding,</i>

05:43.536 --> 05:45.060
<i>you're the person that I wanted to see.</i>

05:45.060 --> 05:47.373
<i>I even ran up your fire escape with roses.</i>

05:47.407 --> 05:50.651
<i>Um, I don't know what I was gonna say,
but I knew that I needed to see you</i>

05:50.652 --> 05:54.079
<i>and then I saw Cooper and you, and
look, if you're happy with Cooper,</i>

05:54.114 --> 05:56.048
<i>just disregard this whole message.</i>

05:56.082 --> 05:59.718
<i>But if you think you might,
like, be happier with me,</i>

05:59.753 --> 06:01.553
<i>call me back. This is Josh, by the way.</i>

06:02.923 --> 06:05.058
Oh, my God. Josh.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.427
I know. Pretty intense.

06:10.111 --> 06:11.699
Did you really leave me that message?

06:12.351 --> 06:13.465
Sure did.

06:13.805 --> 06:17.002
Huh. Can I ask you something?

06:17.037 --> 06:20.973
- Anything.
- How come I never got it?

06:24.210 --> 06:27.281
Oh. Well, good question.

06:27.281 --> 06:31.019
And, uh, how come my
message is on your computer?

06:32.788 --> 06:35.876
Another good question.

06:36.247 --> 06:38.524
Hmm... is it possible

06:38.558 --> 06:40.485
that you tricked me
into giving you my phone,

06:40.486 --> 06:42.428
so that you could delete
the message before I got it

06:42.449 --> 06:43.939
because you started dating someone new?

06:43.953 --> 06:45.431
What? (Coughs)

06:47.500 --> 06:49.534
That's a little bit of a reach.

06:50.403 --> 06:54.039
Gabi, I... I saw you with Cooper.
I didn't want to screw up your life.

06:54.074 --> 06:55.207
Yeah, well, you were with Jilly,

06:55.241 --> 06:57.743
so maybe you just didn't want
to screw up your own life.

06:58.430 --> 06:59.870
Now, what do you want for breakfast?

06:59.871 --> 07:01.443
W-what I want is to hear you
say we're gonna be together.

07:01.444 --> 07:03.275
- No!
- Why, you're staying with Cooper?

07:03.276 --> 07:05.218
Oh, my God! No, Josh...

07:05.652 --> 07:07.619
I can't take this. Okay? I quit.

07:08.163 --> 07:10.971
- What?
- I can't do this anymore.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.693
Okay? I can't come to work and go
through this with you every single day!

07:15.221 --> 07:17.538
Gabi, you can't quit.
What are you gonna do?

07:18.862 --> 07:21.792
Well, for your information,

07:22.168 --> 07:25.971
I have an apprenticeship
with the very famous

07:26.006 --> 07:27.891
Chef Charles D'Arby.

07:28.571 --> 07:29.602
You do?

07:30.977 --> 07:33.158
Well, it's... it's not
so much an apprenticeship

07:33.158 --> 07:35.881
as... as it is an audition
for an apprenticeship.

07:37.617 --> 07:41.169
- It is?
- Well, it's... it's not so much

07:41.169 --> 07:43.438
an audition as it is an
application for an audition

07:43.438 --> 07:45.797
that could lead to an apprenticeship.

07:48.270 --> 07:49.470
So you have nothing?

07:50.032 --> 07:51.991
Well, I could've lied
and said I had something,

07:51.992 --> 07:53.460
but I'm not you, Josh.

07:54.434 --> 07:55.803
Goodbye.

07:59.155 --> 08:01.940
Waffles. I should have said I
wanted waffles for breakfast.

08:07.047 --> 08:09.715
Gabi, what are you doing out here?

08:09.749 --> 08:11.884
I'm waiting to hear if I got the audition.

08:11.918 --> 08:14.486
And this is the only place
where I get full bars.

08:14.521 --> 08:19.591
- Oh! Hey, Dabney!
- (Dabney) Hi!

08:19.626 --> 08:22.361
So, you know, I was reading
about that apprenticeship online.

08:22.395 --> 08:25.130
And I didn't realize how hard
it was to get an audition.

08:25.165 --> 08:27.478
- Sofia, I'm going to get this.
- Oh, no, of course. No.

08:27.479 --> 08:29.911
I 1000% believe you will get this.

08:29.911 --> 08:32.905
But, um, in case you don't,
it's not the end of the world.

08:32.938 --> 08:35.293
You know? You... you still
have your job at Josh's.

08:35.293 --> 08:37.490
- I quit Josh's.
- What?

08:37.490 --> 08:38.943
I know, it seems crazy.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.472
But the thought of working
for him after everything

08:41.472 --> 08:42.933
we've been though seems just as crazy.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.716
O-okay, are you sure?
Because you have, like,

08:44.751 --> 08:46.985
zero percent chance of getting
that fancy apprenticeship.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.388
Hey! You just said that you believed in me!

08:49.422 --> 08:52.265
Oh, my God, we're gonna have
to sell our hair to pay rent!

08:53.293 --> 08:55.160
- (Phone rings)
- (Both) It's ringing!

08:55.195 --> 08:57.162
- It's them.
- Put it on speaker.

08:57.197 --> 09:00.065
Okay. Hello?

09:00.100 --> 09:02.935
(Man) <i>Miss Diamond, this is Chef D'Arby.</i>

09:02.969 --> 09:05.704
Chef D'Arby, this is Miss Diamond.

09:05.738 --> 09:08.774
<i>You have been chosen to
audition for my apprenticeship.</i>

09:08.808 --> 09:11.643
<i>We'll expect to see you
tomorrow at 9:00 A.M. sharp.</i>

09:11.678 --> 09:15.121
Oh, my God. I... I will be
there. Thank you so much!

09:15.122 --> 09:17.549
- (Screams)
- I knew you'd get it!

09:19.133 --> 09:21.110
(Dabney) Congratulations!

09:21.588 --> 09:23.555
Thanks, Dabney!

09:26.887 --> 09:29.094
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

09:29.129 --> 09:31.130
Okay, settle down. It's time to focus.

09:31.164 --> 09:33.984
I am focused. Sofia, look at this place.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.902
- That's Chef D'Arby.
- Whoa!

09:36.903 --> 09:38.428
They sure know how to grow them in England.

09:38.429 --> 09:39.187
(Both laugh)

09:39.188 --> 09:42.103
(British accent) Please
sir, can I have some more?

09:42.976 --> 09:45.335
- Look, you can do this.
- Okay.

09:45.336 --> 09:47.546
- Good luck.
- Thanks. (Laughs)

09:49.616 --> 09:51.270
Oh, Chef D'Arby, I'm Gabi Diamond.

09:51.271 --> 09:53.101
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

09:53.102 --> 09:55.387
The opportunity to
touch me inappropriately?

09:55.421 --> 09:58.290
Oh, sorry. Uh, listen, I
just had a quick question.

09:58.291 --> 10:00.392
What... what was it that
actually got me the audition?

10:00.426 --> 10:03.328
Was it my recipes? Was it
my knife skills? (Laughs)

10:03.996 --> 10:06.763
Actually, it was Mr. Kaminski.

10:16.109 --> 10:19.148
- You got me this audition?
- You're welcome.

10:19.148 --> 10:22.375
- How could you?
- I thought that's what you wanted.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.576
No! What I wanted was to do it myself.

10:24.610 --> 10:26.478
Look, I was just trying
to help you get your dream.

10:26.512 --> 10:28.919
Yeah, exactly, Josh. My dream. Mine.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.151
I thought I was doing something nice.

10:30.152 --> 10:32.317
Oh please, you were just
trying to win me back!

10:32.351 --> 10:34.219
Really? Does that sound like a good plan?

10:34.253 --> 10:35.809
To help you get an
internship in Switzerland

10:35.810 --> 10:37.155
that takes you away from me for six months?

10:37.190 --> 10:39.510
- How is that getting you back?
- I don't know, Josh.

10:39.510 --> 10:42.351
But all you've done is made me realize
that I'm not supposed to be here.

10:43.796 --> 10:46.832
Everybody, take your places.

10:46.866 --> 10:48.160
We are about to begin.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.338
Look, all I did was get you the audition.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.636
It's up to you to win it.

10:52.672 --> 10:55.731
And the dish you will be preparing is...

10:56.209 --> 11:00.722
[Speaking French]

11:02.348 --> 11:06.077
- You have two hours.
- I need two hours to translate that.

11:07.019 --> 11:09.721
Now, Ms. Renard, the <i>Bordelaise</i> ?

11:14.300 --> 11:16.167
You, Mr. Harper.

11:19.281 --> 11:21.082
On to you, Miss Diamond.

11:29.408 --> 11:32.144
Bit of a consistency problem there.

11:32.178 --> 11:34.179
Well, I-I can fix it, I can fix it.

11:34.614 --> 11:37.579
It's over, Miss Diamond. Off you go!

11:37.580 --> 11:39.985
What? Off I go? Off I go?

11:42.054 --> 11:43.054
(Quietly) Off I go...

11:48.776 --> 11:51.696
- (Knock on door)
- Go away!

11:54.029 --> 11:55.897
Oh. Cooper.

11:55.931 --> 11:57.927
Hey. Don't be upset.

11:57.928 --> 12:00.529
I just came to grab my
stuff, drop off your key.

12:01.765 --> 12:05.401
Not to be judgey, but what is
the white stuff under your nose?

12:05.435 --> 12:10.239
Oh. Um... it's my drug of choice: Frosting.

12:11.014 --> 12:15.231
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah. Never worse.

12:16.684 --> 12:19.608
- How are you?
- Well, I lost my girlfriend

12:19.608 --> 12:21.075
and my best friend.

12:21.352 --> 12:23.111
Those are both you, by the way.

12:23.421 --> 12:26.323
Cooper, I'm... I'm so sorry
for the way things ended.

12:26.324 --> 12:28.391
No, Gabi, I'm sorry.

12:29.988 --> 12:31.856
You're amazing.

12:31.890 --> 12:34.125
You know, you're, like, up here.

12:34.159 --> 12:36.994
And I'm down here.

12:37.029 --> 12:40.531
And a guy down here never
gets the girl up here.

12:40.565 --> 12:43.190
So when I found out Josh
had feelings for you,

12:43.902 --> 12:45.808
I panicked.

12:46.405 --> 12:49.219
I thought if you found out, I'd lose you.

12:49.220 --> 12:51.022
Cooper, you don't have to tell me all this.

12:51.023 --> 12:52.126
Yes, I do.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.571
I can accept us not being together,

12:54.572 --> 12:58.100
what I can't accept is the
way I acted at the karaoke bar.

12:59.051 --> 13:00.680
I need you to know that
I'm better than that.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.446
Of course you are.

13:02.888 --> 13:06.339
If you weren't, then I wouldn't
have fallen in love with you.

13:06.825 --> 13:09.086
And I never meant to hurt you.

13:10.009 --> 13:11.126
I know.

13:18.525 --> 13:20.238
(Smacking lips)

13:20.238 --> 13:21.623
Frosting's up there, too.

13:29.110 --> 13:30.603
Why?

13:31.085 --> 13:33.019
Oh! Hey, Sofia.

13:33.054 --> 13:34.829
I'm just whipping up
a little midnight snack

13:34.829 --> 13:37.312
of <i>filet de boeuf forestiere</i>
with <i>Bordelaise</i> sauce

13:37.313 --> 13:39.059
and <i>petit gratin dauphinois.</i>

13:40.761 --> 13:42.062
Why?

13:42.708 --> 13:44.613
Because I'm better than
that audition, Sofia.

13:44.614 --> 13:47.315
I mean, it's because of Cooper. Even though
he knew we weren't gonna get back together,

13:47.315 --> 13:48.818
he still wanted to redeem himself.

13:48.818 --> 13:50.561
And that's what I have
to do with Chef D'Arby.

13:50.561 --> 13:52.626
You know, I'm fine with not
getting the apprenticeship.

13:52.627 --> 13:55.107
You know, what I'm not fine with
is Chef D'Arby only remembering me

13:55.107 --> 13:57.767
- for my ploppy sauce.
- (Yawns) Oh, sweetie.

13:58.110 --> 14:00.512
I'm sure he's barely
thought about you at all.

14:00.749 --> 14:03.193
Well, he's going to remember me, okay?

14:03.194 --> 14:05.785
I-I didn't get the job, but
I can get my reputation back.

14:05.785 --> 14:08.234
And this time, my <i>boeuf</i>
will raise the roof.

14:09.868 --> 14:11.960
Well, if you're gonna see
him again, give him my number.

14:11.961 --> 14:14.500
I'd like a bite of his <i>boeuf</i>. (Laughs)

14:23.537 --> 14:26.779
Chef D'Arby, I'm really sorry to interrupt.

14:27.010 --> 14:30.223
Oh, may I ask what amazing
dish the maestro is preparing?

14:30.223 --> 14:32.809
- Eggs.
- Oh.

14:32.897 --> 14:36.609
Well, listen, I know
my sauce went plop-plop

14:36.609 --> 14:38.595
when it should have gone whoosh.

14:38.595 --> 14:40.467
And I don't expect you to change your mind,

14:40.467 --> 14:42.889
but I couldn't live with myself
knowing I didn't do my best work.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.805
So, may I now present...

14:44.805 --> 14:47.322
<i>Filet de boeuf forestiere</i>

14:47.323 --> 14:49.284
with <i>Bordelaise</i> sauce

14:49.285 --> 14:51.965
and <i>petit gratin dauphinois.</i>

14:52.368 --> 14:53.435
Whoosh.

14:57.538 --> 15:00.116
I hope this cow was
slaughtered more humanely

15:00.116 --> 15:02.575
than you just slaughtered
the French language.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.644
Oh, it's French!

15:11.322 --> 15:12.385
Well done.

15:12.811 --> 15:15.955
In the ten years since
I've had this competition,

15:15.990 --> 15:17.891
not a single contestant has had the courage

15:17.925 --> 15:19.449
to try and redeem themselves with me.

15:19.449 --> 15:21.439
Well, honestly, Chef D'Arby,
I didn't do it for you.

15:21.440 --> 15:24.122
- I did it for me.
- Well, I'm impressed.

15:24.359 --> 15:27.358
I hope to see you again
next year, Chef Diamond.

15:31.327 --> 15:32.895
Did you just call me chef?

15:33.708 --> 15:35.756
I'm a chef, I'm a chef!

15:35.756 --> 15:38.578
- No hugging.
- Disagree to disagree.

15:40.844 --> 15:42.678
(Knock on door)

15:44.956 --> 15:47.554
- Gabi.
- Thank you.

15:48.294 --> 15:48.998
What?

15:48.999 --> 15:51.306
I was so mad at you
for meddling in my life,

15:51.307 --> 15:53.938
and I should've just said thank you.

15:55.393 --> 15:57.394
So, you got the apprenticeship?

15:57.500 --> 15:58.520
Not even close.

15:58.999 --> 16:01.045
But thanks to you, I
got the chance to fail,

16:01.045 --> 16:04.274
which gave me the chance to pick
myself up and prove to Charles D'Arby

16:04.274 --> 16:06.015
that I'm worthy of the title chef.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.561
Good for you.

16:08.562 --> 16:10.477
It was nice of you to
come by and say thanks...

16:10.478 --> 16:12.938
Wait. Wait, wait. There's more.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.785
In the spirit of second chances,
how about you give me one?

16:17.213 --> 16:19.001
Josh, I really wanna be your...

16:19.002 --> 16:20.038
- Chef.
- Girlfriend. Chef.

16:20.039 --> 16:21.563
Yes, Chef.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.426
I would love to have you as my chef again.

16:23.427 --> 16:25.646
- I think I heard "girlfriend."
- Did you hear that?

16:26.305 --> 16:29.186
I was hoping you said chef loud enough
so all you heard was "chef-friend."

16:31.006 --> 16:34.324
Listen, Josh, what we have
between us is undeniable.

16:34.325 --> 16:36.530
But it's also crazy and
messy and confusing...

16:36.530 --> 16:38.011
- Go on a date with me.
- What?

16:38.651 --> 16:40.187
Gabi, you and I have been through so much,

16:40.188 --> 16:42.927
but the one thing we've never
done is go on a simple date.

16:43.678 --> 16:46.376
So... will you?

16:47.481 --> 16:49.215
Uh...

16:50.283 --> 16:52.473
Look, you're still gonna
have a job even if you say no.

16:52.473 --> 16:55.566
But I think you and I
deserve a second chance, too.

16:57.291 --> 17:01.392
- Huh.
- Is that a yes or...?

17:01.899 --> 17:05.902
It's a "huh" with "yes" tendencies.

17:06.867 --> 17:10.413
Okay. I'll see you tonight at
Elliot and Alan's engagement party?

17:10.414 --> 17:12.275
- Absolutely.
- Take you to dinner afterwards?

17:12.276 --> 17:13.760
I will think about it.

17:14.541 --> 17:15.875
I'll see you tonight.

17:21.974 --> 17:24.143
She's gonna think about it!

17:28.934 --> 17:31.703
- How do I look?
- Amazing!

17:31.704 --> 17:35.407
I'm pretty sure we're gonna be the two
cutest girls at that gay engagement party.

17:35.441 --> 17:38.643
(Laughs) You know, I'm really happy
about the way this all turned out.

17:38.678 --> 17:42.247
I think it's really true, when God
closes a door, he opens a window.

17:42.281 --> 17:43.964
(Phone rings)

17:45.284 --> 17:48.548
- Hello?
- <i>Miss Diamond, this is Chef D'Arby.</i>

17:48.841 --> 17:51.593
Chef D'Arby? Oh, hello,
what can I do for you?

17:52.011 --> 17:55.680
<i>It has come to my attention that the
winner of the competition cheated.</i>

17:55.715 --> 17:57.582
<i>She found out the audition dish in advance.</i>

17:57.616 --> 17:59.484
<i>Normally, I'd offer the
position to the first runner-up,</i>

17:59.518 --> 18:01.486
<i>but I was so impressed by you,</i>

18:01.520 --> 18:03.881
<i>I've decided to offer
you the apprenticeship.</i>

18:04.623 --> 18:06.835
- Really?
- <i>I know this is short notice,</i>

18:06.835 --> 18:09.425
<i>but we need you on the
red eye to Zurich tonight.</i>

18:09.718 --> 18:12.230
<i>I'm expecting you in the
kitchen Monday morning.</i>

18:12.701 --> 18:14.432
<i>Congratulations, Chef.</i>

18:14.467 --> 18:16.586
Oh! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

18:16.586 --> 18:18.578
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God! You did it!

18:18.579 --> 18:20.338
- I did it!
- Oh!

18:20.372 --> 18:22.442
Wait, wait, wait. What about Josh?

18:22.790 --> 18:25.971
- What about the apprenticeship?
- Oh! Josh, the apprenticeship.

18:25.971 --> 18:28.980
Josh, the apprenticeship. How do
I suddenly have so many options?

18:29.227 --> 18:32.618
God opened too many windows.
Why did you open so many windows?

18:33.886 --> 18:35.653
What am I gonna do, Sofia?

18:39.425 --> 18:40.625
What would Julia do?

18:40.659 --> 18:41.856
Uh...

18:42.661 --> 18:44.124
Roberts or child?

18:45.297 --> 18:46.897
Child. Child! The one who cooks!

18:46.897 --> 18:47.825
Oh!

18:51.403 --> 18:54.172
I must really love this man
'cause I'm wearing a bow tie.

18:54.206 --> 18:55.373
(Laughter)

18:55.407 --> 18:57.142
And I must really love this man

18:57.176 --> 19:00.528
because I'm having my engagement
party at a karaoke bar.

19:00.529 --> 19:02.090
(Laughter)

19:02.114 --> 19:05.139
Oh, damn, baby, who ordered the fajitas?

19:05.140 --> 19:08.753
- 'Cause you are sizzling hot.
- Thank you.

19:08.788 --> 19:10.989
Oh, you... I never thought I'd see the day.

19:11.023 --> 19:13.091
You may be going on a date with Gabi,

19:13.125 --> 19:14.793
Elliot getting married,

19:14.827 --> 19:18.897
and here I am... with nothing.

19:18.964 --> 19:20.632
I have a tab open at the bar.

19:20.666 --> 19:22.267
Except that.

19:23.469 --> 19:26.410
(Phone vibrating)

19:26.410 --> 19:27.428
_

19:27.439 --> 19:30.608
(Gabi) <i>Hey, Josh. I'm calling
because I have some news.</i>

19:30.643 --> 19:33.478
<i>Some really amazing news.</i>

19:33.512 --> 19:35.580
<i>I got the apprenticeship.</i>

19:35.614 --> 19:37.382
<i>I hate to tell you this over the phone,</i>

19:37.416 --> 19:39.384
<i>but if I saw you in person,
I'm not sure I'd be able</i>

19:39.418 --> 19:41.252
<i>to make the same decision.</i>

19:41.287 --> 19:43.354
<i>After this crazy week of deciding</i>

19:43.389 --> 19:47.009
<i>whether I should choose
Cooper or choose you,</i>

19:47.359 --> 19:50.909
<i>I decided to choose me.</i>

19:51.163 --> 19:54.960
<i>And it's the hardest decision
that I've ever had to make.</i>

19:55.301 --> 19:58.908
<i>I'm really sorry we didn't get a
second chance. I hope you understand.</i>

19:59.238 --> 20:02.061
<i>You've always been there for
me, so I know that you will.</i>

20:02.341 --> 20:05.210
<i>Okay, I'll send you guys a postcard. Bye!</i>

20:05.244 --> 20:07.412
<i>Oh, this is Gabi, by the way.</i>

20:09.461 --> 20:11.263
It's just sad, Dabney.

20:12.529 --> 20:16.183
Gabi's only been gone a few
days and it's just really hard.

20:16.184 --> 20:19.602
You know, I rattle around
the apartment, eat cereal.

20:19.603 --> 20:21.470
We used to do everything together.

20:21.505 --> 20:24.673
Shop, get pedicures, order takeout.

20:24.708 --> 20:26.048
You know what the worst part is?

20:26.049 --> 20:29.402
She took the tablet so
I'm stuck using the laptop.

20:30.255 --> 20:33.324
It just really sucks. You know what I mean?

20:33.583 --> 20:36.604
(Dabney) My dog tells me to burn stuff.

20:41.625 --> 20:44.029
Oh. (Clears throat)

20:44.257 --> 20:45.431
Good talk.
