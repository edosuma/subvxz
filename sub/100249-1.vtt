01:50.276 --> 01:52.446
Haw, Togo! Haw! Haw!

01:55.657 --> 01:57.827
Good dog! Good dog!

02:04.791 --> 02:05.791
Leave it!

02:11.965 --> 02:13.675
Leave it alone!

02:30.358 --> 02:31.358
Good dog.

02:42.078 --> 02:43.198
Well done, Togo!

02:44.164 --> 02:45.174
Well done, all!

02:45.749 --> 02:48.629
There'll be full bellies
and warm beds tonight.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.049
All right, Togo! Hike!

03:21.826 --> 03:24.786
Whoa!

03:28.041 --> 03:29.961
There's been a diphtheria outbreak.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.043
How long?

03:31.127 --> 03:33.167
- More than a week.
- Constance?

03:33.254 --> 03:34.264
Fine. She's fine.

03:35.173 --> 03:36.383
It's mostly children.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.394
Five have died.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.140
Bless them.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.930
Twenty more sick here in Nome.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.929
And no telling how many
in the Inuit villages.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.769
They found serum in Fairbanks.

03:47.852 --> 03:50.612
They just don't know how
to get it from there to here.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.649
Anyway, everybody's at Dexter's,
and they're asking for you.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.119
Hike!

04:04.369 --> 04:06.829
What we have in our children
is an epidemic.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.746
And without antitoxin,
it's a death sentence to most,

04:10.834 --> 04:12.174
if not all those infected.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.165
The good news is,

04:16.255 --> 04:19.755
they've located antitoxin
at the Fairbanks Railroad Hospital,

04:20.260 --> 04:23.430
and they're ready
to put it on the next train to Nenana.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.143
A round trip from here to Nenana
is still 600 miles.

04:26.224 --> 04:30.524
They have aeroplanes in Fairbanks,
and we could fly it here.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.753
Did you see those clouds on the horizon
when you came over?

04:32.772 --> 04:35.402
Of course I did,
but maybe it's not as bad as it looks.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.659
Seppala, you were out there.
What do you think?

04:41.823 --> 04:42.993
It's going to be bad.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.913
How bad?

04:46.494 --> 04:48.004
Memorable, I think.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.998
What makes you think?

04:50.457 --> 04:52.577
Well, it looks biblical enough,

04:52.667 --> 04:56.797
and the barometer's falling
in a pretty disturbing way but...

04:57.922 --> 04:59.012
But what?

04:59.716 --> 05:01.626
We came up on caribou this morning.

05:01.718 --> 05:04.548
About 200 yards to our right, he saw them.

05:04.637 --> 05:08.767
My foot was ready on the brake,
and he ignored them and kept running.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.524
That's when I knew this storm was special.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.153
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.441
Togo's a caribou chaser of some renown.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.859
I still don't understand.

05:19.944 --> 05:23.374
Never in 12 years
had he not at least turned for them.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.485
When an animal denies his nature

05:26.576 --> 05:29.326
and runs for the barn
because he fears the storm...

05:29.954 --> 05:31.834
man better fear the storm.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.673
I see.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.801
In a storm like this,
how quickly could you get there and back?

05:37.879 --> 05:39.299
Not "how quickly,"

05:39.381 --> 05:40.381
"if."

05:41.883 --> 05:43.223
Then I say aeroplane.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.847
Open cockpit aeroplane?

05:47.347 --> 05:50.137
Water-cooled engines?
Did you call that airfield in Fairbanks?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.555
They're making an assessment.

05:51.643 --> 05:52.733
I'll bet they are.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.483
I seriously don't think
flying's an option.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.818
But, in answer to your question,
"how quick?"

05:59.651 --> 06:02.401
Seppala once ran for me,
all the way to Nenana, in four days.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.992
For factual reference only.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.794
Personally I never cared
for the notion that sled dogs

06:08.868 --> 06:10.618
should be replaced by machines,

06:11.246 --> 06:14.076
but today I'm a champion of progress.

06:17.669 --> 06:18.799
Come on, pup.

06:42.277 --> 06:45.107
Seppala, you going by the hospital?

06:46.114 --> 06:47.124
Climb on.

06:52.871 --> 06:53.871
Hike!

07:06.009 --> 07:07.719
Whoa! Whoa!

07:14.601 --> 07:15.601
Much obliged.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.821
Good luck, doctor.

07:25.528 --> 07:29.488
Towns are, uh,
usually founded by topography...

07:30.617 --> 07:33.037
proximity to roads and rivers.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.250
Nome was founded by luck.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.711
The gold at Anvil Creek?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.455
You could see it with your naked eye,

07:43.380 --> 07:45.550
pick it up with your fingers
from the sand.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.514
Gold dries up.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.104
Luck dries up.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.932
Where does he find the energy?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.977
By his reckoning,
he's still ten weeks old.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.573
So, you'll go?

09:35.241 --> 09:38.871
I just got home.
You're anxious to be rid of me?

09:38.953 --> 09:40.253
Hmm. Could be.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.290
Have reason for me to be gone, do you?

09:43.375 --> 09:44.825
- I have lovers.
- Ah?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.168
Too many to count.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.302
I have no one but myself to blame.

09:48.797 --> 09:52.377
I was warned
not to marry someone so beautiful.

09:52.467 --> 09:53.797
Warned by whom?

09:54.719 --> 09:56.139
Everyone with eyesight.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.229
So, you will go?

10:03.812 --> 10:05.612
I have no such inclination.

10:05.689 --> 10:07.519
Then why are you waxing sled runners?

10:10.318 --> 10:11.488
They need wax.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.750
Can it even be done in this weather?

10:27.252 --> 10:28.462
Anything can be done.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.625
Well, let them choose
someone else for once.

10:31.381 --> 10:33.511
- The room was full of mushers.
- Right.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.431
But it's always my husband they come for.

10:36.511 --> 10:38.301
Pick someone with more at stake in this.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.187
I stopped at the hospital.
All those children, we know them.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.024
I know.

10:47.105 --> 10:51.065
That little girl that lives next to Mallon
and always runs out to pet the dogs.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.491
Sally, who pets everyone's dogs,
not just yours.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.316
We know those children.
We know their parents.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.197
I understand this.
And tomorrow I'll be ashamed.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.327
But right now, I'm sorry, I'm afraid.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.048
It's not the first storm to hit Alaska.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.418
Don't patronize me.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.014
You're right.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.962
Don't take Togo. Fritz could lead.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.131
I'll cross that bridge when and if.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.800
He's 12 years old.
You said he's too old to go to Elwald,

11:52.879 --> 11:54.959
and that isn't even
a quarter of this distance.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.798
You're upsetting yourself for nothing.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.012
Let's go to sleep.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.748
I must say this before you make a decision
you'll forever regret.

12:14.943 --> 12:18.573
You're more attached to him than you know,
and you're about to run him to his death.

12:19.030 --> 12:22.620
And you're not prepared for what
it's going to do to you, I promise you.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.250
Is that all?

12:26.705 --> 12:30.165
He is, of course, your dog,
and a working dog.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.250
And, were I more pragmatic,
I wouldn't love him, but I do.

12:34.087 --> 12:39.177
And I'm just so heartsick
that these are my last hours with him.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.141
Two things.

12:42.637 --> 12:48.097
One: if I were to try for Nenana
in these conditions without him,

12:48.184 --> 12:51.234
these would be your last hours with me.

12:51.312 --> 12:56.532
And two: at this hour, nothing's decided.

13:01.698 --> 13:02.818
You were saying?

13:09.247 --> 13:10.247
George?

13:10.874 --> 13:12.674
Evening, George.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.961
It appears your forecast is correct,

13:15.420 --> 13:17.300
if my journey out here is any evidence.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.549
The wind almost stopped me dead
a couple times.

13:24.387 --> 13:29.347
Oh, I... I talked with Fairbanks.
There will be no airborne rescue of Nome.

13:30.643 --> 13:36.523
So, the time of the dog,
not only continues, it's at hand.

13:36.608 --> 13:39.438
So, you felt the need to come
all the way out here to share this news?

13:39.527 --> 13:41.357
Some things you need to say
to a man's face,

13:41.446 --> 13:42.816
isn't that right, Mr. Mayor?

13:44.199 --> 13:45.199
Yeah.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.289
Coffee or whiskey?

13:47.911 --> 13:50.211
Whiskey. If it's no trouble.

13:50.288 --> 13:53.248
No. No trouble. I'm having both.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.721
We have to be smart about this.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.892
You're going to ride in the sled
when I tell you.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.518
No squirming. No arguments, for once.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.910
Got one more in ya, pup?

14:30.954 --> 14:32.044
Almost there.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.539
Good dogs.

14:44.676 --> 14:45.756
I've seen worse.

14:46.678 --> 14:47.848
We could have a picnic.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.860
I'll be back before you know it.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.859
I won't even make the bed.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.581
Hey. Hey.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.457
You bring him back to me, okay?

15:21.212 --> 15:22.712
And you come back to me.

15:25.717 --> 15:26.887
Good boy.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.150
All right, Togo!

15:47.697 --> 15:48.777
Hike!

16:31.116 --> 16:32.406
Come on, Togo!

16:32.492 --> 16:34.082
Come on, Togo!

16:35.912 --> 16:38.962
Come on! There you go.

16:39.708 --> 16:40.708
Hike!

17:07.694 --> 17:08.704
Here it comes.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.004
You tend to your business,
I'll tend to mine.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.205
How can it not be my business?
No dogs in the bedroom.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.836
He's in such pain.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.093
And in our bedroom.

18:13.385 --> 18:16.345
A runt has more imperfections
than just size, you know.

18:17.055 --> 18:20.425
Nature has its ways of sorting things out.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.017
Oh, should I just drown him
and speed up the process?

18:23.520 --> 18:30.150
I'm just saying that Alaska
can be particularly cruel to the weak.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.025
I don't need to be reminded.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.279
What does it cost you
to give this life a chance?

18:39.619 --> 18:42.829
What does he bring
to the breed if he survives?

18:46.960 --> 18:48.380
The heart of a survivor.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.628
You're too softhearted.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.799
You're too Norwegian.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.446
Get!

19:18.867 --> 19:20.697
Why don't you put him back in the kennel?

19:20.785 --> 19:23.405
Every time I do, he digs his way out.

19:23.997 --> 19:28.747
I'm spending more daylight filling holes
than doing the work I should be doing.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.917
I catch you, you'll be sorry.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.551
It's all your fault.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.017
I thought you were supposed to be
a great trainer of dogs.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.518
He's a devil.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.600
Saint Francis of Assisi
would shoot this dog.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.395
Hey!

19:49.731 --> 19:51.901
- He's fast.
- He's mentally deficient.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.322
He's undersized,
unintelligent, untrainable.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.363
Yeah, but he's fast.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.567
I think you ought to give him
a chance on the sled.

19:59.657 --> 20:02.577
Stop, stop. That is not a sled dog.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.790
Never ever.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.540
Well, you won't know until you try.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.292
I won't know, period.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.584
Victor Anderson wants one of my pups.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.497
Well, I have the dog to give him.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.719
Every year we go through this.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.264
Not like this.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.517
How many times do I have to remind you?

20:24.599 --> 20:28.139
They're not pets. They're not our friends.
They're not our children.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.690
They're animals.

20:30.772 --> 20:31.942
Work animals.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.158
Serves you right.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.179
Here you go.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.868
Here's your damn dog back!

22:21.549 --> 22:25.469
Well, shame on you, Victor Anderson.
If you didn't want a dog, why bother us?

22:25.553 --> 22:27.433
He's more trouble than he's worth.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.729
I think I'll go down now.

22:35.313 --> 22:36.483
I would.

22:58.753 --> 22:59.753
Hike up!

23:17.772 --> 23:19.022
The easy part is over.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.035
Easy! Easy!

23:55.352 --> 23:57.852
Whoa. Whoa!

23:58.855 --> 23:59.855
Haw!

24:04.611 --> 24:05.951
Whoa!

24:35.392 --> 24:39.272
Togo! Hike up! Hike up!

24:45.110 --> 24:50.070
Togo! Togo! Hike up!
Hike up!

25:01.209 --> 25:02.499
Pull, Togo!

25:02.585 --> 25:03.835
Pull!

25:05.171 --> 25:06.171
Pull up!

25:13.346 --> 25:14.346
Pull!

25:14.431 --> 25:17.141
Togo! Pull up!

25:26.693 --> 25:27.693
Yes!

25:28.236 --> 25:29.236
Yes!

25:35.994 --> 25:37.004
Good dog!

25:42.959 --> 25:44.629
Yes! Pull.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.428
Good dog!

25:56.514 --> 25:59.434
Next time I go the wrong way,
you tell me to go to hell.

26:00.894 --> 26:02.024
Good dog.

26:03.188 --> 26:04.648
Good dogs, all!

26:11.112 --> 26:13.072
We have to take care of this
at the roadhouse.

26:31.758 --> 26:32.838
Thank you.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.834
Her name, Atiqtalik,

26:56.908 --> 26:59.948
means "polar bear mother."

27:01.204 --> 27:03.674
Your dog is her cub now.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.345
She can fix.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.640
What does her song say?

27:25.937 --> 27:27.977
"Don't worry, young one...

27:29.441 --> 27:32.361
soon it'll be warm again."

27:38.908 --> 27:42.828
When I finish,
you'll start serving life in prison.

27:43.747 --> 27:45.867
All because I married a Belgian.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.094
Belgium is a soft country.

27:49.794 --> 27:52.964
Norway, on the other hand,
is a harsh country.

27:53.965 --> 27:57.335
In Brussels,
you'd sleep in a feathered bed

27:58.011 --> 27:59.931
and have salmon roe for breakfast.

28:00.764 --> 28:03.644
In Storfjord, your days would be numbered.

28:05.226 --> 28:08.976
Lesson number one: never marry a Belgian.

28:09.606 --> 28:11.316
They're sentimental.

28:11.399 --> 28:13.229
And you end up doing days of hard work

28:13.318 --> 28:16.448
for a problem that a bullet
solves in seconds.

28:17.614 --> 28:22.704
Lesson number two: for you, Satan,
or whatever your name is...

28:25.080 --> 28:26.750
try digging out now.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.137
Okay!

28:48.186 --> 28:50.686
Hike! Hike! Good job!

31:10.286 --> 31:11.956
Hey! Stop that!

31:12.831 --> 31:14.081
Hey!

31:14.165 --> 31:17.535
Hey, stop that! Hey!

31:17.627 --> 31:20.167
Whoa!

31:21.297 --> 31:22.757
No! No!

31:23.925 --> 31:24.925
You.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.773
Oh, no.

31:32.851 --> 31:35.101
Easy now. Leave it!

31:35.186 --> 31:36.226
Leave it!

31:37.105 --> 31:38.765
No! No!

31:39.691 --> 31:42.191
Leave it! No!

31:45.989 --> 31:47.319
On by!

31:50.660 --> 31:51.660
Leave it!

31:57.917 --> 31:59.207
Leave it alone!

32:01.838 --> 32:02.838
No!

32:07.177 --> 32:08.597
Whoa!

32:12.557 --> 32:13.887
Haw! Haw!

32:44.381 --> 32:45.471
Go! Get!

32:48.426 --> 32:51.716
Since when did you start worrying about
keeping people out of the tack room?

32:51.805 --> 32:53.425
This isn't for keeping people out.

32:55.850 --> 32:59.190
You're taking him out of the kennel
and putting him in here?

32:59.270 --> 33:00.690
The kennel won't hold him.

33:01.231 --> 33:03.361
- Apparently your dog...
- Not my dog.

33:03.441 --> 33:06.111
Your dog, who disrupts my team.

33:06.194 --> 33:08.204
Your dog, who jumps on me

33:08.279 --> 33:10.779
no matter how many knees
I put to his chest.

33:10.865 --> 33:13.985
Your dog,
who violates the rules of the pack

33:14.077 --> 33:17.537
and upsets the hierarchy
I've worked years to establish.

33:18.373 --> 33:22.753
Your cur,
who rewards your kind nature with anarchy.

33:24.754 --> 33:26.134
This is for keeping him in.

33:31.511 --> 33:33.141
Was that a piece of our house?

34:08.130 --> 34:09.261
Hey!

34:09.341 --> 34:10.380
Hike!

34:14.512 --> 34:15.512
Good dogs!

36:39.407 --> 36:40.867
Well, good afternoon.

36:52.337 --> 36:53.587
Good luck, little one.

36:58.593 --> 37:00.973
Hey! You again?

37:01.054 --> 37:02.974
Just leave it. Leave it!

37:03.848 --> 37:05.978
Stop! No!

37:07.268 --> 37:11.108
Stop! Let... You little devil.

37:13.024 --> 37:14.614
Hey! Stop that!

37:25.870 --> 37:27.750
When you see Oki, say hello.

37:27.831 --> 37:29.291
Not going to see Oki.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.581
You're gonna cut across the Sound?

37:31.668 --> 37:32.918
It'll save me a day.

37:33.003 --> 37:34.173
It'll cost you your life.

37:34.254 --> 37:35.384
I've done it before.

37:36.297 --> 37:37.667
The ice is unpredictable now.

37:37.757 --> 37:39.547
We'll make it. Listen to me,

37:40.301 --> 37:44.141
stay away from contact with people
until I come back with the medicine.

37:45.765 --> 37:48.175
Who would be foolish enough
to come here in this weather?

38:37.650 --> 38:38.690
All right, Togo.

38:41.905 --> 38:42.905
Hike!

39:31.746 --> 39:33.916
Good dog! On by!

39:46.720 --> 39:49.640
What, my pups, are we to fear ice now?

39:50.557 --> 39:53.307
He which hath no stomach to this fight.

39:54.185 --> 39:57.475
Let him depart.
His passport shall be made.

39:57.564 --> 40:00.574
We will not die in that dog's company.

40:01.234 --> 40:06.454
Old dogs forget
but he will remember, with advantages,

40:06.531 --> 40:08.371
the feats he did that day.

40:09.200 --> 40:14.580
Then shall our names familiar in his mouth
as household words,

40:14.664 --> 40:16.464
Seppala, the driver,

40:17.167 --> 40:21.047
Fritz and Sally, Molly and Red and Togo,

40:21.421 --> 40:23.761
the great Togo in lead,

40:23.840 --> 40:28.220
be all in their flowing water bowls
freshly remembered.

40:29.012 --> 40:34.562
And dogs in Nome, now abed, shall think
themselves accursed they were not here.

40:35.852 --> 40:42.532
We few, we happy few,
we band of champions.

40:43.568 --> 40:47.278
Now, run, my pups. Run!

41:18.895 --> 41:21.015
Max, get this out to the Associated Press.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.230
People should know what's happening here.

41:24.901 --> 41:26.441
This is all you want to write?

41:28.029 --> 41:29.239
It's all I have in me.

41:59.269 --> 42:01.769
"Temperatures
of almost 60 degrees below zero

42:01.855 --> 42:04.475
and winds topping 50 miles an hour."

42:04.566 --> 42:06.816
"Man and dog risk all

42:07.318 --> 42:10.568
on a 640-mile round trip."

42:10.655 --> 42:12.155
With lives in the balance,

42:12.240 --> 42:15.490
a heroic race runs through conditions
so terrible we can scarcely imagine.

42:15.577 --> 42:18.257
The question on everyone's lips is not
"can they get there and back in time?"

42:18.288 --> 42:20.208
but "can they get there and back at all?"

42:36.681 --> 42:39.931
Well done, pups. Well done!

43:06.836 --> 43:07.996
You're trail weary.

43:09.047 --> 43:10.167
I've been worse.

43:12.342 --> 43:13.802
So, to Nulato next?

43:14.344 --> 43:15.804
In an hour.

43:15.887 --> 43:17.677
Why? We bothering you?

43:18.264 --> 43:20.314
Only the white man bothers me.

43:21.685 --> 43:24.055
I only tolerate you
because I like your little dog.

43:24.604 --> 43:26.404
You like to bet on my little dog.

43:27.816 --> 43:30.856
There are advantages
to being at this roadhouse on race days.

43:32.112 --> 43:36.832
Most dogs, when they reach Shaktoolik,
have worry in their eyes.

43:37.867 --> 43:40.037
This one, never.

43:40.745 --> 43:42.245
This one wants to hurry up and win

43:42.330 --> 43:44.920
so he can chase caribou
and fight polar bear.

43:47.252 --> 43:48.802
I tried to give him away, you know.

43:52.590 --> 43:53.590
Twice.

44:21.536 --> 44:22.746
Whoa!

44:30.712 --> 44:33.342
When I told my father
I was leaving for Alaska,

44:33.965 --> 44:36.045
he laughed at me.
He thought it was a joke.

44:36.801 --> 44:38.851
Only an idiot would be foolish enough

44:38.928 --> 44:42.468
to give up an apprenticeship in Norway
to be unemployed in America.

44:44.351 --> 44:47.811
When I said the word "gold,"
he slapped me.

44:48.813 --> 44:52.153
And he promised me
that the only gold I would find in Alaska

44:52.233 --> 44:53.993
was what I'd brought in my own teeth.

44:56.029 --> 44:57.529
He was right.

44:59.324 --> 45:01.624
I've dug so many holes in this country.

45:02.577 --> 45:06.747
The law of averages would say that,
at least, I'd find some gold but...

45:08.875 --> 45:09.875
no.

45:13.254 --> 45:16.554
My business is dogs, not pets.
Working dogs.

45:16.633 --> 45:18.803
And hard decisions have to be made.

45:19.552 --> 45:21.892
If this is the hardest decision
we ever have to make,

45:21.971 --> 45:24.221
then you can consider us lucky.

45:26.935 --> 45:29.395
You see spirit and something lovable.

45:30.355 --> 45:34.605
All I see is trouble,
waste of time, and failure.

45:37.028 --> 45:38.028
Step up!

45:48.415 --> 45:51.745
Oh, he's just perfect.

45:51.835 --> 45:54.745
He's an escape artist, though,
as I told you before.

45:54.838 --> 45:58.588
Oh. Don't worry about that.
I want him to be an inside dog.

45:58.675 --> 45:59.965
Well, inside might not...

46:00.051 --> 46:02.101
Last winter I had wolves at the door.

46:02.178 --> 46:04.848
They would jump up at the window
and stare at me.

46:05.598 --> 46:09.268
Trust me. There were no wolves
where I was raised in Ireland.

46:09.352 --> 46:13.732
But with this lad by my side,
no wolf would dare enter.

46:13.815 --> 46:15.475
Unless he opens the door for them.

46:16.526 --> 46:17.736
I beg pardon?

46:17.819 --> 46:21.819
Uh, my wife was just reminding me that
we must be going.

46:21.906 --> 46:25.076
So, please, enjoy your puppy.

46:25.160 --> 46:26.240
Thank you.

46:32.584 --> 46:36.634
It's okay, sweetheart.
This is your new home.

46:41.051 --> 46:42.091
He'll be fine.

47:02.489 --> 47:03.569
Okay, hike!

47:11.081 --> 47:12.871
That's enough now, you daft mongrel.

47:13.875 --> 47:15.745
You're no dog, you're the Devil himself.

47:16.586 --> 47:19.916
That's it. You go ahead and run.

47:20.006 --> 47:21.626
There's no way out.

47:22.842 --> 47:24.592
All the time in the world.

47:24.678 --> 47:27.758
You'll run till you're tired,
then we can start working on your manners.

47:28.848 --> 47:32.308
Oi! This isn't Little Creek anymore,
you little hooligan.

47:41.027 --> 47:42.947
Ah, that's better.

47:43.613 --> 47:45.033
There you are.

47:45.115 --> 47:46.445
Now, you be a good boy

47:47.117 --> 47:49.367
and I'll fix you a nice beef steak
for your lunch.

47:53.957 --> 47:55.497
Oh, no! No. No!

48:13.893 --> 48:15.603
Hike! Hike!

48:20.567 --> 48:21.567
Whoa!

48:55.352 --> 48:56.602
Whoa!

49:08.156 --> 49:09.156
Hey!

49:10.492 --> 49:13.202
Every predator for miles
smells that blood.

49:13.995 --> 49:15.285
I'm trying to save your life.

49:16.331 --> 49:18.291
Okay, Russky, come with me.

49:19.250 --> 49:21.750
Come on, up. Up.

49:24.339 --> 49:25.339
Good dog.

49:27.217 --> 49:29.757
Oh, no. Don't even think about it.

49:37.811 --> 49:40.941
All right. Last row for you.

49:44.067 --> 49:50.447
Meet Ilsa. Try something with her
and I promise you, you'll regret it.

50:12.971 --> 50:14.721
All right, hike!

50:50.008 --> 50:52.888
Well, you outran Ilsa.
Let's see how you do on point.

50:54.971 --> 50:55.971
Good.

50:57.682 --> 50:58.732
Come on.

51:02.062 --> 51:03.312
Good dog, Jens.

51:58.284 --> 51:59.374
Haw!

52:10.380 --> 52:11.800
Good pups.

52:47.959 --> 52:51.669
Good dogs! Good dogs! Good dogs!

53:02.098 --> 53:05.058
Whoa!

53:05.143 --> 53:07.443
It's the most extraordinary thing
I've ever seen.

53:07.520 --> 53:09.610
He's not a sled dog, he's a lead dog.

53:09.689 --> 53:12.479
You should have seen him.
He outran every single one of them.

53:13.360 --> 53:16.860
- He's magnificent. A future champion.
- There's blood.

53:16.946 --> 53:20.906
You were right.
He's got the heart of a survivor.

53:22.869 --> 53:24.999
I'm going to name him Togo.

53:25.789 --> 53:29.919
After the admiral.
An underdog named for an underdog.

53:31.211 --> 53:32.301
It's fitting.

53:44.641 --> 53:47.561
Honey! Come here, please?

53:52.148 --> 53:54.438
Come. Step around him, he won't move.

53:54.526 --> 53:57.736
- I have things to do.
- Over here. Next to me.

53:58.697 --> 53:59.697
Please.

54:07.330 --> 54:10.920
Okay, now, call him.
Ask him to come into the bedroom.

54:11.793 --> 54:12.793
Do it.

54:14.087 --> 54:15.167
Togo, come.

54:15.797 --> 54:16.837
Again.

54:16.923 --> 54:20.013
- This isn't fair.
- Of course it is. Again, more demanding.

54:21.636 --> 54:24.506
Togo, you come in this room!

54:24.597 --> 54:26.977
My husband is trying to prove
a point of some kind.

54:28.143 --> 54:30.443
No dogs in the bedroom.

54:31.646 --> 54:33.816
Good boy, Togo. Good boy.

54:34.357 --> 54:36.647
Outstanding!

54:37.736 --> 54:38.736
Good dog.

54:39.446 --> 54:41.486
I don't care what the governor says,
he's wrong.

54:41.573 --> 54:44.083
Irrespective of how you feel, Jafet...

54:44.159 --> 54:45.579
Well, Mrs. Seppala.

54:45.660 --> 54:48.660
Any musher would be lucky
to survive 30 miles in this weather.

54:48.747 --> 54:51.327
Seppala's the only one
who can survive a longer run!

54:51.416 --> 54:53.336
What's this nonsense about a relay?

54:53.710 --> 54:56.550
Uh, now, Constance, this is a good thing.

54:56.629 --> 54:58.049
- Is this it?
- It is.

54:58.131 --> 55:00.341
Fourteen teams stationed
at these roadhouses

55:00.425 --> 55:02.215
between Nenana and Shaktoolik.

55:02.302 --> 55:04.392
Even as we speak,
they're running short legs

55:04.471 --> 55:06.471
passing the serum
from one sled to the next.

55:06.556 --> 55:10.556
And on our end, two teams will go out
to these roadhouses and wait for Seppala.

55:11.895 --> 55:14.055
We'll need another sled
for the relay on our end.

55:14.147 --> 55:15.997
Is it possible you can
put together a team for us?

55:16.024 --> 55:17.034
Of course.

55:17.108 --> 55:18.538
Do you think your man, Gunnar,
would drive them?

55:18.568 --> 55:19.988
- Of course.
- Good.

55:20.070 --> 55:21.610
The governor came up with this when?

55:21.696 --> 55:23.406
Twelve hours after Seppala departed.

55:24.657 --> 55:27.537
Leave it to a politician to change
the rules after the game's begun.

55:27.619 --> 55:29.999
No. This is a good thing.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.540
Seppala won't have to go as far.

55:31.623 --> 55:34.173
- But he has no idea there's a relay.
- Exactly.

55:34.250 --> 55:36.290
Just... Please.

55:38.046 --> 55:40.296
Now, by best estimate,

55:40.382 --> 55:44.142
the relay should be at the roadhouse
in Shaktoolik tomorrow.

55:44.219 --> 55:46.259
Now the governor's people
have worked this all out.

55:46.346 --> 55:49.516
And by all accounts, when Seppala arrives
at Shaktoolik tomorrow,

55:49.599 --> 55:51.429
the serum will be there waiting for him.

55:51.518 --> 55:52.888
He's in Shaktoolik now.

55:54.020 --> 55:56.900
- Or past it.
- What? No. No, that's not possible.

55:56.981 --> 56:00.321
I know my husband, if there's ice
on Norton Sound, he's crossed it.

56:00.402 --> 56:02.702
In this storm?
Surely he's not going to try and cross...

56:02.779 --> 56:03.859
Of course he would.

56:04.656 --> 56:07.656
Going around the Sound
is 90 miles, crossing it is 20.

56:07.742 --> 56:08.992
He saves a day each way.

56:09.077 --> 56:12.537
George, if there's ice on the Sound,
he's crossed it.

56:13.373 --> 56:14.933
And if they don't meet at the roadhouse...

56:14.958 --> 56:18.208
Then they'll just hook up on the trail.

56:18.294 --> 56:21.214
There are 1,000 ways a driver
can miss another on the trail.

56:21.297 --> 56:23.217
A thousand ways in good weather.

56:24.092 --> 56:26.012
- You know this.
- I do.

56:26.094 --> 56:29.474
So, if my husband doesn't magically run
into your relay team,

56:29.556 --> 56:30.656
the one he is not even looking for,

56:30.682 --> 56:32.392
he and his dogs will drive on for Nenana.

56:32.475 --> 56:35.725
And your relay driver,
when he realizes he's missed them,

56:35.812 --> 56:37.232
he will set out on his own.

56:37.313 --> 56:38.673
But he wouldn't do that, would he?

56:38.732 --> 56:41.072
- Who is it? Who's the driver?
- Henry Ivanoff.

56:41.151 --> 56:43.031
Well, Henry is tough and brave,

56:43.111 --> 56:46.161
and he's not going to sit in front
of a warm fire while children die.

56:46.239 --> 56:47.659
I promise you that. He'll set out.

56:50.285 --> 56:51.405
Well, can he make it?

56:54.122 --> 56:55.962
I won't speculate on the life of a musher.

56:58.585 --> 56:59.585
Can he?

57:01.588 --> 57:04.048
My guess is
we don't find Henry until the spring.

57:05.050 --> 57:08.600
Not him, not his dogs,
not the serum, until the thaw.

57:09.512 --> 57:10.512
But, uh...

57:10.597 --> 57:12.137
Four days ago, in this very room,

57:12.223 --> 57:15.563
we concluded only one man and one dog
could make that run.

57:16.269 --> 57:18.019
And nothing has changed but the weather.

57:20.106 --> 57:21.226
It's worse.

57:21.858 --> 57:24.438
All those children... lost.

57:29.449 --> 57:30.619
Pray they meet.

57:53.515 --> 57:55.055
Gee! Gee!

57:58.770 --> 58:01.560
Gee! Gee! Round.

58:10.824 --> 58:13.244
Hike! Gee! Gee!

58:22.669 --> 58:24.549
Leave it. Leave it!

58:25.171 --> 58:27.261
Haw! Haw!

58:30.176 --> 58:31.176
Leave it!

58:33.304 --> 58:34.314
Haw!

59:09.007 --> 59:10.007
No, no, no, no, no.

59:10.842 --> 59:12.052
Sepp, no!

59:12.802 --> 59:13.802
Don't!

59:15.680 --> 59:17.220
Sepp! Sepp!

59:19.059 --> 59:20.309
I have the serum!

59:21.936 --> 59:24.686
No! I have the serum.

59:25.857 --> 59:26.857
Sepp!

59:28.026 --> 59:29.066
Sepp!

59:30.320 --> 59:31.320
No!

01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:37.682
Bill Shannon took the first leg.
Ran through the night.

01:00:38.513 --> 01:00:39.973
Fifty below, easy.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.734
He arrived in Tolovana
with his face black from frostbite.

01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:47.151
He passed on to Ed Kallands.

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:50.981
They had to pour hot water on his hands
'cause they were frozen to the sled.

01:00:52.819 --> 01:00:54.199
Then went Tommy Patsy.

01:00:56.197 --> 01:00:57.317
Then Jackscrew.

01:00:58.199 --> 01:01:00.699
But none of us are as tough as you, Sepp.

01:01:07.167 --> 01:01:08.877
- Sepp?
- Yeah, what?

01:01:10.211 --> 01:01:11.211
You okay?

01:01:12.797 --> 01:01:15.427
Of course. Never better.

01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:22.024
What about him?

01:01:22.098 --> 01:01:23.138
What about him?

01:01:24.559 --> 01:01:26.269
Please take this the right way, okay?

01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:31.229
That, right there,
is the best dog I've ever known...

01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:35.236
but what I'm looking at is a spent animal.

01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:40.123
He is.
This storm just about broke all my pups.

01:01:42.118 --> 01:01:44.698
I wouldn't be a true friend
if I didn't speak my mind and...

01:01:50.043 --> 01:01:52.923
Leave him here. I'll take good care of him
till the weather breaks.

01:01:53.004 --> 01:01:54.094
He's my lead!

01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:58.757
Now do yourself a favor
and tend to your own.

01:02:04.474 --> 01:02:05.484
Sure, Sepp.

01:02:13.066 --> 01:02:14.106
I'm sorry.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:17.780
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

01:02:17.862 --> 01:02:19.492
Yeah, don't give it a second thought.

01:02:19.572 --> 01:02:22.492
No, that was shameful of me.

01:02:23.368 --> 01:02:25.948
Especially since what you said
was out of kindness.

01:02:28.206 --> 01:02:29.456
Whatever happens tomorrow,

01:02:29.541 --> 01:02:32.591
fortune or fault,
is mine and mine to reconcile.

01:02:33.586 --> 01:02:36.126
But I thank you, Henry,
for thinking of the dog.

01:02:38.508 --> 01:02:39.678
Not many do.

01:02:45.724 --> 01:02:48.144
"To sleep, to sleep."

01:02:49.144 --> 01:02:50.984
The long bright day is done.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:54.520
And darkness rises
from the fall of the sun.

01:02:56.067 --> 01:02:58.487
To sleep, to sleep.

01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:02.906
Whate'er thy joys,
they vanish with the day.

01:03:04.034 --> 01:03:08.204
Whate'er thy griefs,
in sleep they fade away.

01:03:09.164 --> 01:03:11.424
To sleep, to sleep.

01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:16.548
Sleep mournful heart
and let the past be past.

01:03:17.172 --> 01:03:19.262
Sleep, happy soul.

01:03:20.216 --> 01:03:22.796
All life will sleep at last.

01:03:24.846 --> 01:03:25.846
To sleep.

01:03:27.515 --> 01:03:28.765
"To sleep."

01:03:32.729 --> 01:03:34.649
Still time for me to place a bet?

01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:36.571
Thanks for your hospitality.

01:03:36.649 --> 01:03:37.939
Looks like I was wrong.

01:03:38.026 --> 01:03:41.696
You weren't wrong.
The die is cast. We'll make it.

01:03:52.415 --> 01:03:54.785
All right, Togo! Hike!

01:03:59.547 --> 01:04:01.047
He's going across the Sound again.

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.585
Seppala, no!

01:04:04.761 --> 01:04:06.471
He knows what his dogs have left.

01:04:07.639 --> 01:04:10.019
For him, it's the Sound or nothing.

01:04:48.388 --> 01:04:49.388
Hike!

01:05:04.237 --> 01:05:05.237
Gee! Gee!

01:05:18.209 --> 01:05:19.339
Haw! Haw!

01:05:22.797 --> 01:05:24.167
Good puppies!

01:05:25.508 --> 01:05:26.678
Good dogs!

01:05:27.635 --> 01:05:29.505
Good dog! Go puppies!

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:31.180
Go!

01:05:32.515 --> 01:05:33.925
Hold up, Togo!

01:05:36.353 --> 01:05:37.563
Good dog.

01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:40.022
Run!

01:05:42.275 --> 01:05:43.275
Run!

01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:46.203
On straight.

01:05:49.074 --> 01:05:50.454
Run, puppies!

01:06:02.253 --> 01:06:04.513
- Come on! Come on!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

01:06:09.636 --> 01:06:12.636
Twenty more dollars on Leonhard Seppala.

01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:15.925
Twenty dollars on those itty-bitty dogs.

01:06:16.017 --> 01:06:17.887
Scotty Allan,
the greatest musher of all time,

01:06:17.977 --> 01:06:20.017
left the last roadhouse in the lead.

01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:21.225
Friend, this race is over.

01:06:35.662 --> 01:06:36.962
You see that?

01:06:37.038 --> 01:06:39.288
That's the best dog team
in the world, right there.

01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:42.915
- Hike! Hike!
- They know who they are,

01:06:43.003 --> 01:06:45.013
time for us to find out who we are.

01:06:46.965 --> 01:06:50.635
Go! Come on, puppies!

01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:53.219
Haw! Haw!

01:06:53.304 --> 01:06:58.234
Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!

01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:59.729
Hike! Good dog!

01:07:07.235 --> 01:07:09.355
Come on, dogs! Come on, dogs!

01:07:09.446 --> 01:07:12.816
Hike! Hike! Hike! Hike!

01:07:12.907 --> 01:07:17.947
Good dogs! Good dogs! Good dogs!

01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:19.038
Hike, doggy!

01:07:24.294 --> 01:07:25.504
Whoo-hoo!

01:07:27.756 --> 01:07:28.966
Wait a minute.

01:07:29.049 --> 01:07:30.379
That's not Scotty.

01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:33.966
Who is that?

01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:38.814
That, my friends, is Leonhard Seppala
and his itty-bitty dogs.

01:07:38.892 --> 01:07:42.152
Whoo!

01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:55.951
Whoa!

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.960
Congratulations, Sepp.

01:08:08.797 --> 01:08:10.507
Togo. Hi.

01:08:10.924 --> 01:08:13.934
Well done. You did it.

01:08:14.552 --> 01:08:15.762
Good boy.

01:08:29.818 --> 01:08:32.148
Did you ever think we'd have
such a thing on our wall?

01:08:32.237 --> 01:08:35.657
I never thought we'd have
$5,000 in prize money.

01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.700
Prize money you can't hang on a wall.

01:08:37.783 --> 01:08:40.754
Actually, you can if you have enough pins.

01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:44.460
All thanks to this troublemaker.

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:49.046
The only one
who never underestimated you, was you.

01:08:49.129 --> 01:08:52.339
And my genius wife.

01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:54.974
My beautiful, genius wife.

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:26.457
Haw!

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:29.710
Haw!

01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:49.019
Hike up!

01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:25.516
Hike up!

01:10:30.188 --> 01:10:31.518
Up! Up! Up!

01:11:00.301 --> 01:11:01.301
Run!

01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:11.475
Hike up!

01:11:38.882 --> 01:11:40.882
Togo! Hike up! Go!

01:11:48.975 --> 01:11:49.975
Good dog!

01:11:51.519 --> 01:11:53.019
Good dog!

01:11:54.564 --> 01:11:55.944
Run puppies!

01:12:05.992 --> 01:12:06.992
We made it.

01:12:09.954 --> 01:12:11.414
We made it!

01:12:14.876 --> 01:12:16.586
Whoa! Whoa!

01:13:09.973 --> 01:13:12.643
No matter what happens, forgive me.

01:13:18.481 --> 01:13:21.191
Hike up, Togo! Hike!

01:13:26.781 --> 01:13:28.621
Hike up! Hike up!

01:13:37.334 --> 01:13:38.544
Pull up, Togo!

01:13:39.461 --> 01:13:40.631
Pull!

01:13:41.671 --> 01:13:42.841
Pull!

01:13:43.256 --> 01:13:45.216
No, Fritz. Wait! Wait!

01:13:57.062 --> 01:13:58.062
Yes!

01:14:01.483 --> 01:14:02.573
Yes! Hike!

01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:38.521
Good boy, Togo! Good dog.

01:14:41.314 --> 01:14:42.574
Good dogs, all!

01:14:49.155 --> 01:14:50.485
Get up there, puppies.

01:15:00.041 --> 01:15:01.381
You know, I can do that.

01:15:01.918 --> 01:15:04.048
I'll do it. Drink that.

01:15:27.485 --> 01:15:28.485
Why?

01:15:40.498 --> 01:15:42.328
The pine stings her eyes.

01:15:52.594 --> 01:15:54.304
Thank you for doing this, Gunnar.

01:15:54.387 --> 01:15:55.717
Anything I can do to help.

01:15:56.139 --> 01:15:58.309
My greatest worry is that
he'd be within miles and...

01:15:58.391 --> 01:16:00.231
No such thing is going to happen.

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:04.150
Sepp is the best musher I know.
Nothing will stop him from getting home.

01:16:04.230 --> 01:16:06.440
If you'll outfit the sled,
I'll start pulling dogs.

01:16:06.524 --> 01:16:08.194
No, no, Mrs. Seppala. I can do both.

01:16:08.276 --> 01:16:09.436
You should sleep.

01:16:09.527 --> 01:16:11.197
I've had my fill of time in the house.

01:16:11.279 --> 01:16:14.819
If it's all the same to you,
I'd prefer to fetch dogs.

01:16:14.908 --> 01:16:17.908
Sure. And who do you think
I should have in lead?

01:16:17.994 --> 01:16:21.414
Fox is the best dog left.
Paired with Balto.

01:16:22.415 --> 01:16:23.535
They won't win any races,

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:25.785
but they'll plow through snow
and run home for dinner.

01:16:37.347 --> 01:16:38.347
Thank you.

01:16:47.148 --> 01:16:48.148
Hike up!

01:16:49.359 --> 01:16:50.569
Good dogs.

01:16:57.117 --> 01:16:59.327
Pass the word
there's chores waiting for him.

01:17:00.203 --> 01:17:01.203
Gladly.

01:17:06.751 --> 01:17:08.841
Fox, Balto. Hike!

01:17:25.478 --> 01:17:26.478
Come with me.

01:17:27.105 --> 01:17:28.305
I haven't the time.

01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:30.074
Come.

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:31.440
I need to go.

01:17:40.201 --> 01:17:41.951
Last night I was worried about you.

01:17:43.997 --> 01:17:46.247
Thought you'd bit off
more than you could chew.

01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:49.206
Then I saw that.

01:17:50.837 --> 01:17:52.167
And asked myself...

01:17:53.256 --> 01:17:56.756
"Why should Amituk worry about any man...

01:17:58.136 --> 01:18:00.756
who cheats death like this?"

01:18:17.655 --> 01:18:19.445
Now, you're gonna ride in the sled.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.330
Even if it's just for 20 miles.

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:31.125
Come now, for once ride in the sled.

01:18:33.672 --> 01:18:34.672
Stay.

01:18:58.071 --> 01:18:59.071
Hike!

01:19:44.034 --> 01:19:45.044
Whoa!

01:20:03.136 --> 01:20:07.216
Togo! I'm sorry. I can't help you.

01:20:08.016 --> 01:20:09.016
I can't see.

01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:11.726
We need to get to the next roadhouse.

01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:14.437
Take us to Big Joe. I know you can.

01:20:16.024 --> 01:20:17.194
I know you can.

01:20:18.068 --> 01:20:20.238
Good dog. Good dog.

01:20:21.738 --> 01:20:22.738
Hike up!

01:21:46.322 --> 01:21:47.572
Oh, no.

01:21:58.835 --> 01:21:59.955
Togo?

01:22:05.175 --> 01:22:06.175
Togo?

01:22:15.143 --> 01:22:18.153
We can't stop. We must keep going.

01:22:18.855 --> 01:22:23.775
Do you understand? We stop, we die.

01:22:24.569 --> 01:22:29.989
Listen to me, if you stop, you die.

01:22:40.335 --> 01:22:41.745
- Seppala?
- Oh!

01:22:43.421 --> 01:22:45.301
- Seppala, is that you?
- Oh, God.

01:22:45.382 --> 01:22:47.092
Joe, we're here.

01:22:47.175 --> 01:22:48.465
Oh, God.

01:22:48.551 --> 01:22:50.391
The serum's in the sled.

01:22:54.974 --> 01:22:57.194
You go inside.
I'll get the dogs in the barn.

01:22:57.268 --> 01:22:58.808
Thank you. But not him.

01:23:02.816 --> 01:23:04.776
You're magnificent.

01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:15.701
Magnificent. Magnificent.

01:23:16.746 --> 01:23:18.456
Seppala! Inside.

01:24:01.207 --> 01:24:02.917
Now, Leonhard, your race is over.

01:24:03.752 --> 01:24:04.922
Just have a drink with me.

01:24:11.843 --> 01:24:14.513
This one, this one here.

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:18.390
All those miles in this storm,
12 years old.

01:24:19.517 --> 01:24:21.307
That's just incredible.

01:24:21.394 --> 01:24:22.404
Wish me luck.

01:24:54.469 --> 01:24:56.139
Charlie, you made it.

01:24:56.221 --> 01:24:58.061
- Here.
- Is this the serum?

01:24:58.139 --> 01:24:59.929
- Warm this.
- Aye.

01:25:00.016 --> 01:25:01.726
- Good luck, Gunnar.
- Thanks.

01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:04.650
My dogs, my dogs, they're... I need help.

01:25:52.068 --> 01:25:53.398
There is a sled coming to town.

01:26:04.205 --> 01:26:05.535
Here.

01:26:05.623 --> 01:26:06.713
Thank you.

01:26:13.465 --> 01:26:17.755
Sir, I need your name,
for the record, sir.

01:26:18.345 --> 01:26:19.635
Gunnar Kaasen.

01:26:20.263 --> 01:26:23.023
"Gunnar Kaasen." Excellent.

01:26:23.099 --> 01:26:26.189
Now, the lead dog. What's its name?

01:26:26.269 --> 01:26:27.899
One's called Fox.

01:26:27.979 --> 01:26:29.229
"Fox"?

01:26:29.314 --> 01:26:32.654
People will think it's a real fox.
The other one, what's its name?

01:26:33.401 --> 01:26:34.531
Balto.

01:26:34.611 --> 01:26:37.111
"Balto." Yeah. Perfect.

01:26:37.822 --> 01:26:40.372
Hey! Get that dog's photo there.

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:44.200
That's Balto. Champion savior of Nome.

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:38.220
You ought to stay another week, at least.

01:27:38.299 --> 01:27:39.469
Look at this.

01:27:39.551 --> 01:27:43.511
I know, I just wish
you would allow yourself more...

01:27:43.596 --> 01:27:45.556
You've been a fine host, Joe.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:47.890
You treated me and my dogs like family.

01:27:47.976 --> 01:27:49.016
Thank you.

01:27:54.566 --> 01:27:55.646
He up to it?

01:28:01.573 --> 01:28:02.573
We'll make it.

01:29:21.736 --> 01:29:23.026
There's a dog in our bedroom.

01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:24.860
Yes, there is.

01:29:26.991 --> 01:29:28.371
There's a dog on our bed.

01:29:29.369 --> 01:29:32.209
Yes. There is.

01:30:11.828 --> 01:30:12.908
You should've woke me.

01:30:13.997 --> 01:30:16.077
You had him to yourself long enough.

01:30:17.042 --> 01:30:18.882
Then again,
to hear the newspapers tell it,

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:21.880
you never left the house.
It was all Balto and Gunnar.

01:30:21.963 --> 01:30:23.053
We have company.

01:30:35.185 --> 01:30:37.805
If you like pears, these'll put
a smile on your face, I think.

01:30:37.896 --> 01:30:39.186
Thank you, Eileen. Come in.

01:30:40.315 --> 01:30:43.815
Ah, bacon.
It's the best I ever made right here.

01:30:43.902 --> 01:30:45.362
Thank you, Bill.

01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:48.030
Hey, Sepp!

01:30:48.656 --> 01:30:49.866
Really, this is too much.

01:30:50.658 --> 01:30:52.038
Oh, it's not nearly enough.

01:30:55.455 --> 01:30:56.655
Good morning, Dan.

01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.753
Morning, Constance.

01:30:59.834 --> 01:31:00.884
Sepp.

01:31:01.503 --> 01:31:06.633
So, I had some furs laying around
and I stuffed them with straw.

01:31:06.716 --> 01:31:09.716
You know, something for between him
and the cold floor.

01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:11.720
Hey, Togo.

01:31:11.805 --> 01:31:13.215
I made something for you.

01:31:15.558 --> 01:31:16.938
Well, go on. Give it a try.

01:31:19.104 --> 01:31:20.114
Go on.

01:31:32.242 --> 01:31:34.702
Thank you, Dan.
Have a seat. I'll bring you some coffee.

01:31:35.662 --> 01:31:38.672
Uh, no. No, I mean, I'd love to,

01:31:38.748 --> 01:31:42.668
but I have my own dogs to attend,

01:31:42.752 --> 01:31:44.632
so thank you.

01:31:47.257 --> 01:31:48.257
Sepp.

01:31:52.762 --> 01:31:53.762
Morning, Dan.

01:31:54.597 --> 01:31:56.427
- Knock-knock.
- Hello, Mayor. Come in.

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:00.100
That all right, then?

01:32:00.186 --> 01:32:01.686
Sepp, thank you so much.

01:32:02.856 --> 01:32:04.646
We appreciate
everything you've done for us.

01:32:05.734 --> 01:32:07.194
Ever so grateful, Mr. Seppala.

01:32:07.277 --> 01:32:08.737
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

01:32:23.293 --> 01:32:24.673
No, it's too much.

01:32:38.058 --> 01:32:41.558
Hi, Sally. Hello, Dev.
Won't you please come in?

01:32:48.485 --> 01:32:50.105
- For me?
- Mm-hmm.

01:32:55.658 --> 01:32:56.868
It's Togo.

01:32:57.285 --> 01:32:58.365
Thank you.

01:32:59.579 --> 01:33:02.079
Father carved it, but I painted it.

01:33:02.832 --> 01:33:05.592
Well, it's a brilliant likeness, Sally.
Thank you.

01:33:13.635 --> 01:33:15.005
He likes his ears.

01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:21.140
Another man would be enjoying all this
but not a private man like yourself.

01:33:21.226 --> 01:33:22.476
Am I right?

01:33:22.894 --> 01:33:24.774
Do you think he stayed warm outside?

01:33:24.854 --> 01:33:27.774
I wouldn't have come myself
if not for her insistence.

01:33:27.857 --> 01:33:30.527
But she wanted to see him...

01:33:32.195 --> 01:33:36.825
and I want to be with her at every moment.

01:33:36.908 --> 01:33:37.908
Around the side.

01:33:37.992 --> 01:33:40.622
- Top?
- The top.

01:33:40.704 --> 01:33:44.624
It's strange. You know, I...
I see her and yet...

01:33:45.792 --> 01:33:49.052
I don't know how to describe it,
it's unworldly.

01:33:49.671 --> 01:33:50.761
Does that make sense?

01:33:52.173 --> 01:33:56.553
Kinda like every moment I'm with her
seems impossible yet...

01:33:58.054 --> 01:33:59.144
yet there she is.

01:34:05.311 --> 01:34:06.311
Mr. Seppala...

01:34:07.564 --> 01:34:08.984
is Togo going to die?

01:34:16.406 --> 01:34:18.196
Leonhard. Leonhard.

01:34:21.619 --> 01:34:24.659
Um, excuse me.
I have cake for you both so please stay.

01:34:24.748 --> 01:34:26.248
- Okay.
- Please.

01:34:28.793 --> 01:34:30.803
Leonhard, come back inside and apologize.

01:34:30.879 --> 01:34:32.209
They're guests in our home.

01:34:32.297 --> 01:34:34.167
Apologize for me.

01:34:34.257 --> 01:34:36.797
She meant no ill by it.
She's just a child.

01:34:36.885 --> 01:34:38.795
I know. She spoke the truth.

01:34:38.887 --> 01:34:40.927
No, don't say that. He's on the mend.

01:34:41.014 --> 01:34:43.984
It's not winter lameness.
He doesn't have a bad paw.

01:34:44.059 --> 01:34:46.849
You know. You've seen it before.

01:34:50.148 --> 01:34:51.648
Well, could another dog have lead?

01:34:51.733 --> 01:34:53.153
We'll never know.

01:34:53.234 --> 01:34:56.074
Well, I think you should consider a world
where Dev has no child

01:34:56.154 --> 01:34:57.494
and I have no husband.

01:34:57.572 --> 01:35:00.952
Everything you ever tried to warn me about
has come true.

01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:05.250
I have run him to death.

01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:07.961
I have.

01:35:10.085 --> 01:35:12.085
And I'm not at all prepared.

01:36:32.167 --> 01:36:33.287
Be safe.

01:36:59.778 --> 01:37:00.898
I have to go.

01:37:02.655 --> 01:37:03.865
I have to go to work.

01:37:06.326 --> 01:37:07.406
Forgive me.

01:37:26.054 --> 01:37:28.644
Togo. Togo! Hey. Come.

01:37:42.153 --> 01:37:43.993
Togo! Hey! Come.

01:37:44.072 --> 01:37:46.372
Come now.
Togo, come now. Come.

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.910
Togo! Come. Calm down.

01:37:51.287 --> 01:37:52.287
Hike up!

01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:58.460
Quiet!

01:38:12.308 --> 01:38:15.148
Okay. Hike!

01:38:41.338 --> 01:38:42.628
Togo, you want some bacon?

01:38:45.091 --> 01:38:46.681
Good boy. Tog...

01:38:48.553 --> 01:38:51.063
No! No, no, no, no.
No! Togo! Hey!

01:38:51.139 --> 01:38:52.769
Hey! Togo!

01:38:55.435 --> 01:38:57.265
Togo! Togo, come!

01:39:19.626 --> 01:39:20.786
Togo!

01:39:22.921 --> 01:39:24.051
Togo!

01:39:35.892 --> 01:39:36.892
Togo!

01:39:46.069 --> 01:39:47.359
Whoa!

01:40:41.082 --> 01:40:44.042
It was foolish of me
to think Togo would ever be denied.

01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:49.129
I always thought he lived for the sled.

01:40:50.133 --> 01:40:54.893
When all along, what he lived for was me.

01:41:00.769 --> 01:41:02.769
We resumed the trail.

01:41:02.854 --> 01:41:05.694
We discovered a walk was as good as a run.

01:41:11.196 --> 01:41:14.236
As always, Constance was right.

01:41:14.991 --> 01:41:17.451
Togo had the heart of a survivor.

01:41:18.578 --> 01:41:21.038
Not the storm of the century,

01:41:21.122 --> 01:41:23.582
nor a harrowing serum run could stop him.

01:41:26.878 --> 01:41:29.508
He lived out his golden years
with a new job...

01:41:31.132 --> 01:41:32.432
father.

01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:41.850
For two years he sired pups.

01:41:45.522 --> 01:41:48.442
While the lower 48 celebrated Balto,

01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:53.660
mushers from all over the world
elbowed to get one of Togo's line.

01:41:54.781 --> 01:41:56.871
Kennels from Fairbanks to Maine

01:41:56.950 --> 01:42:00.160
bred what came to be known
as Seppala Siberians.

01:42:01.287 --> 01:42:05.287
A breed valued for their intelligence,
stamina, courage,

01:42:05.375 --> 01:42:10.205
but most of all, their good nature
and uncommon bond with humans.

01:42:19.764 --> 01:42:22.274
He left us on a Thursday in December.

01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:31.230
Constance and I continued
working with dogs

01:42:31.317 --> 01:42:34.237
because if you're around them
long enough...

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.320
Whoa!

01:42:35.405 --> 01:42:36.985
They tend to get under your skin.

01:42:38.908 --> 01:42:41.748
And if you're lucky enough
to have known a great one,

01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:44.120
they never really leave.

01:42:45.749 --> 01:42:48.629
They stay with you as long as you live.

01:42:50.003 --> 01:42:51.763
Harnessed to your heart,

01:42:51.838 --> 01:42:53.548
giving their all...

01:42:59.888 --> 01:43:00.888
Hike!

01:43:04.017 --> 01:43:05.267
Always.
