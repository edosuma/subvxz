science officer training

06:58.513 --> 07:01.385

about learning to be, ooh,

07:01.429 --> 07:03.909

07:03.953 --> 07:05.868

Go find Leah Brahms. Shut up.

09:54.471 --> 09:56.125
Ooh, somebody's blushing.

09:56.168 --> 09:58.867
[chuckles] I think she is.
I'm detecting an elevated

09:58.910 --> 10:00.695
-heart rate.
-Stop looking at my heart rate.

10:00.738 --> 10:02.610
Okay, we have to ignore these
totally inaccurate fantasies

10:02.653 --> 10:04.220
at all costs.

10:04.263 --> 10:05.743
Come and look at the warp core
with me and Leah.

10:05.787 --> 10:06.831
[groans]

10:08.572 --> 10:10.966
Huh, I had no idea
that Captain Maier

10:11.009 --> 10:12.794
was going to be so fresh-faced.

10:12.837 --> 10:14.839
What, he just graduate
from the Academy yesterday?

10:14.883 --> 10:16.536
I don't know, but word
around the fleet is that

10:16.580 --> 10:18.626
he's on the fast track
to a Galaxy-class.

10:18.669 --> 10:20.192
Uh, Captain. [chuckles]
I've been researching

10:20.236 --> 10:21.846
Captain Murakami's logs
about the Scrubble,

10:21.890 --> 10:23.369
and I think they are...

10:23.413 --> 10:24.762
-[grunts]
-Captain Maier,

10:24.806 --> 10:26.764
your reputation precedes you.

10:26.808 --> 10:29.114
As does yours, Captain Freeman.

10:29.158 --> 10:31.464
I'm excited to learn from
how you close this deal today.

10:31.508 --> 10:34.076
[chuckles] Well, most of
the work's already been done.

10:34.119 --> 10:36.687
We just need to get everyone
to sign off on final points.

10:36.731 --> 10:37.862
Should only take
a minute or two.

10:37.906 --> 10:39.690
Still, it'll be good to see how

10:39.734 --> 10:41.300
the old school knocks this out.

10:41.344 --> 10:43.563
I'm sure we can do--
Wait, old school?

10:43.607 --> 10:45.609
Now hold on, hold on.
That is totally unfair.

10:45.653 --> 10:47.089
We had no idea that
the rocks we were studying

10:47.132 --> 10:48.873
had any silicate life.

10:48.917 --> 10:51.702
Well, what you call "silicate"
life, we just call "life."

10:51.746 --> 10:53.965
You do not seem alive to us.

10:54.009 --> 10:55.401
[clears throat]
Everyone, everyone, please.

10:55.445 --> 10:57.142
Welcome to the Cerritos.

10:57.186 --> 10:59.623
We have the treaty details
you've agreed to right here.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.929
Perhaps some refreshments?

11:00.972 --> 11:02.626
The Scrubble
thanks you, Captains.

11:02.670 --> 11:04.193
We appreciate the respect

11:04.236 --> 11:06.238
you both show the Scrubble,
unlike these

11:06.282 --> 11:08.023
-insolent scientists.
-Hey.

11:08.066 --> 11:10.286
May we present you
with a sacred

11:10.329 --> 11:12.418
-Scrubble totem?
-FREEMAN: Oh, thank you so much.

11:12.462 --> 11:15.247
It's-it's lovely.
Captain Maier, please feel free

11:15.291 --> 11:17.859
to take this token of respect
for your collection.

11:17.902 --> 11:19.730
Oh, I couldn't possibly,
Captain Freeman.

11:19.774 --> 11:22.124
As the more senior officer,
the statue's all yours.

11:22.167 --> 11:24.866
[laughs]
Take the statue, young man.

11:24.909 --> 11:26.563
[chuckles]
No, I couldn't impose.

11:26.606 --> 11:27.782
-Take it.
-No, you.

11:27.825 --> 11:29.348
-No, please. It's yours.
-Get it away.

11:29.392 --> 11:32.177
-[grunts, panting]
-Please let me help.

11:32.221 --> 11:34.310
I can make you
a captain, Boimler.

11:34.353 --> 11:37.661
-[both grunt]
-Can you triple-check my math?

11:37.705 --> 11:39.968
[grunting]

11:40.011 --> 11:41.534
[cheers]

11:41.578 --> 11:44.624
[gasps] Nailed it, babe.
Let's make out.

11:44.668 --> 11:46.888
Yo, Kearns.
Five more, and we're done.

11:46.931 --> 11:48.411
Looks like you guys
have a ways to go, huh?

11:48.454 --> 11:51.153
-[growls]
-[screams, groans]

11:51.196 --> 11:53.198
What are you doing?
Come on,

11:53.242 --> 11:54.373
-pick it up.
-I think I pulled

11:54.417 --> 11:55.940
my dominant groin.

11:55.984 --> 11:58.377
[laughs] This is great.
It's totally working.

11:58.421 --> 12:00.858
-[grunts]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:00.902 --> 12:02.904
Did you just dunk
that fantasy rock?

12:02.947 --> 12:04.383
The hell were you thinking?

12:04.427 --> 12:06.124
Moving fast, sir.
Getting the job done.

12:06.168 --> 12:08.257
Well, slow it down.
These things are dangerous.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.172
They're not a bunch
of dang basketballs.

12:10.215 --> 12:12.174
Well, we just wanted
to make sure these Carlsbadguys

12:12.217 --> 12:14.959
didn't outpace us and make
Commander Ransom look like

12:15.003 --> 12:16.178
an ineffectual leader.

12:16.221 --> 12:18.310
Ineffectual?
Why would they say that?

12:18.354 --> 12:20.312
Yeah, we overheard them saying
Ransom was a joke, and that

12:20.356 --> 12:22.488
his-his teams are slow,
and his core is weak.

12:22.532 --> 12:24.447
Bull[bleep]. He's got
the strongest core in the fleet.

12:24.490 --> 12:26.884
Now, hurry up. Let's move
some friggin' rocks.

12:26.928 --> 12:28.103
Let me show you how a pro

12:28.146 --> 12:29.844
does it. Whoa. Ooh!

12:31.454 --> 12:33.848
Uh, sir, what happens
if these things break?

12:33.891 --> 12:35.501
I'm sure it's fine.
It probably just makes

12:35.545 --> 12:37.155
a real big fantasy, right?

12:37.199 --> 12:40.289
[chuckles] Watch out,
giant ham sandwich incoming.

12:40.332 --> 12:42.900
[screeching]

12:42.944 --> 12:44.946
Oh, my God. Kukulkan.

12:44.989 --> 12:46.817
-[screams] Whoa!
-[roars]

12:46.861 --> 12:50.081
My beautiful arms. [screams]

12:51.430 --> 12:52.823
[roars]

12:52.867 --> 12:54.433
[all scream]

12:54.477 --> 12:55.870
What was that thing?

12:55.913 --> 12:57.654
Guys, I don't think
that was a fantasy.

12:57.697 --> 12:58.829
I think these broken rocks
are reading our nightmares.

12:58.873 --> 13:00.004
But I don't like my nightmares.

13:00.048 --> 13:02.050
What is that?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.533
[laughs]

13:07.577 --> 13:09.492
[all scream]

13:15.585 --> 13:17.239
-[panting]
-[clowns cackling]

13:17.282 --> 13:19.067
In here, quick.

13:21.591 --> 13:22.897
-[gasps]
-Wow.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.682
Good aim is hot. [screaming]

13:27.162 --> 13:29.860
JENNIFER'S VOICE: I want
to be exclusive! I want us

13:29.904 --> 13:32.036
to grow old and boring and grow

13:32.080 --> 13:33.951
orchids together, babe.

13:33.995 --> 13:36.301
-[snarls]
-[Boimler and Mariner grunting]

13:39.696 --> 13:42.612
Settle down with me!

13:42.655 --> 13:43.961
-Whew.
-Mariner,

13:44.005 --> 13:45.571
you might want
to go back to therapy.

13:45.615 --> 13:47.312
[screams]

13:47.356 --> 13:48.792
[growls]

13:48.836 --> 13:51.012
-Cerritos,come in.
-[static]

13:51.055 --> 13:53.362
Of course. It's not
a real day in Starfleet

13:53.405 --> 13:54.929
till comms get blocked.

13:54.972 --> 13:56.278
Okay, how long before
these things dissipate?

13:56.321 --> 13:58.541
With those psychic mines broken,
who knows?

13:58.584 --> 13:59.847
We'll have to wait it out.

13:59.890 --> 14:01.413
[sighs] We are trapped
in a cave,

14:01.457 --> 14:03.111
and your commander is armless.

14:03.154 --> 14:04.895
I fear we will be
penalized for this.

14:04.939 --> 14:07.028
No, I will. I made us rush.

14:07.071 --> 14:08.377
Why? We had all day.

14:08.420 --> 14:09.813
You guys were going so fast,

14:09.857 --> 14:11.684
we-we were trying
to speed up to beat you.

14:11.728 --> 14:14.339
[sighs] It's clear the Cerritos
has a bad reputation.

14:14.383 --> 14:15.950
We didn't want to live up to it.

14:15.993 --> 14:18.909
Wow. I'm speechless.

14:18.953 --> 14:21.216
Come on, don't pile on.
Look, the Cerritosis actually

14:21.259 --> 14:23.000
a really great place to serve...

14:23.044 --> 14:24.697
No, no, I mean, we were
the ones who were rushing.

14:24.741 --> 14:25.698
What?

14:25.742 --> 14:27.309
You guys are so cool,

14:27.352 --> 14:29.006
and we were just
trying to impress you.

14:29.050 --> 14:30.834
Wait, you think we're cool?

14:30.878 --> 14:33.881
Yes. The tales of your exploits
are widely shared.

14:33.924 --> 14:37.101
The Cerritosis,
in fact, the coolest.

14:37.145 --> 14:38.624
MAIER:
Collecting stuff isn't really

14:38.668 --> 14:40.278
a thing with my generation.

14:40.322 --> 14:43.020
No disrespect, I just don't need
flashy trinkets to...

14:43.064 --> 14:44.848
It's a normal rock.

14:44.892 --> 14:47.329
Ensign, come here, scan this
thing and tell Captain Maier

14:47.372 --> 14:48.983
-it's not flashy.
-[tricorder beeps]

14:49.026 --> 14:50.593
TENDI:
Hmm, it has an anomalous

14:50.636 --> 14:52.116
molecular composition.
I'm actually

14:52.160 --> 14:53.770
getting some pretty
interesting readings...

14:53.813 --> 14:55.076
Stop talking.
It's clearly not fancy.

14:55.119 --> 14:57.469
Ah-ha-ha, see, there you go.

14:57.513 --> 14:59.210
A "pretty interesting" object

14:59.254 --> 15:00.646
for a pretty
experienced captain.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.170
Captains, captains,

15:02.213 --> 15:04.389
maybe we should get to business,
what do you say?

15:04.433 --> 15:06.130
-Take the rock. No, no.
-You take it.

15:06.174 --> 15:07.784
-MAIER: Don't you dare. No, no.
-FREEMAN: It's a gift.

15:07.827 --> 15:10.265
-Just take it. Take it!
-Just take the rock!

15:11.744 --> 15:14.573
Oh, yeah, all the Cali-class
crews talk about the Cerritos.

15:14.617 --> 15:16.619
You guys are famous.

15:16.662 --> 15:18.708
Famous? Us? [chuckles] No way.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.797
Come on, the Cerritosis like

15:20.840 --> 15:22.712
the Enterprise
of the support ships.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.844
You have survived battles
with the Pakleds.

15:24.888 --> 15:27.847
You four stood strong
in an alien trial.

15:27.891 --> 15:29.893
Eh, it was more of a party,
but thanks.

15:29.937 --> 15:32.504
All the other Cali-class ships
just do what they're told,

15:32.548 --> 15:34.550
but the Cerritoskicks ass.

15:34.593 --> 15:36.856
[sighs] We kind of freaked out
when we got this mission.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.989
We just wanted to show you
that we could keep up.

15:39.033 --> 15:41.861
[scoffs] You did more than keep
up. You guys were crushing it.

15:41.905 --> 15:44.038
-[screaming]
-[hissing]

15:45.387 --> 15:48.564
Give us your distinctiveness.
[coughs]

15:49.739 --> 15:50.958
What?

15:55.005 --> 15:57.529
-You're scared of basketballs?
-I'm not.

15:57.573 --> 15:59.662
So, your greatest fantasy
is basketball?

15:59.705 --> 16:01.881
No, I hadn't heard the word
"basketball" in years

16:01.925 --> 16:04.536
until Stevens said it just
before the nightmares showed up.

16:04.580 --> 16:07.191
I guess the stones must've
pulled that from my mind, too?

16:07.235 --> 16:08.627
Fantasies and fears I get,

16:08.671 --> 16:10.629
but why access that part
of your brain?

16:10.673 --> 16:13.284
Uh, there's a bunch of stuff out
there that doesn't make sense.

16:13.328 --> 16:15.678
Hey, babe. [laughs]

16:15.721 --> 16:17.027
BOIMLER:
Does Jennifer wear hats?

16:17.071 --> 16:18.681
No, her antennae
are too sensitive.

16:18.724 --> 16:21.379
[gasps] But I did overhear
Levy mansplaining

16:21.423 --> 16:23.033
the difference between
a pork pie and a fedora

16:23.077 --> 16:24.730
to some poor cadet
the other day.

16:24.774 --> 16:26.994
These stones are recording
way more than we thought.

16:27.037 --> 16:29.997
Something in here is streaming
a ton of data.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.563
Whatever's receiving it

16:31.607 --> 16:33.609
is back there.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.485
[groans] Give it to me straight,
Doc, is it bad?

16:40.529 --> 16:43.662
You're fine, just relax.
I need a sedative over here.

16:43.706 --> 16:45.055
Here you go, Doctor.

16:45.099 --> 16:46.100
What the [bleep]
are you doing here?

16:46.143 --> 16:47.492
Weren't you supposed to start

16:47.536 --> 16:48.667
science officer stuff
with Migleemo?

16:48.711 --> 16:51.061
Yup, first day.
It's going great.

16:51.105 --> 16:53.455
-[bleep] the bed, huh?
-Yes, I think that's accurate.

16:53.498 --> 16:55.370
-Aw, geez, are you about to cry?
-[sniffles]

16:55.413 --> 16:57.546
This guy's not even crying, and
his toes are getting digested.

16:57.589 --> 16:58.547
They are?

16:58.590 --> 17:00.157
Shut up, don't move.

17:00.201 --> 17:02.594
I just don't know if I'm cut out
to be a science officer.

17:02.638 --> 17:04.422
I can't get the captain
to listen to me.

17:04.466 --> 17:06.337
[sighs] Okay,
guess we're doing this.

17:06.381 --> 17:08.426
Tendi, of course
you're cut out for it.

17:08.470 --> 17:09.732
That's why I recommended you.

17:09.775 --> 17:11.125
Then why am I blowing it?

17:11.168 --> 17:12.865
All my studying
hasn't helped at all.

17:12.909 --> 17:14.780
No, no, studying's good,
but in real life

17:14.824 --> 17:16.869
there's gonna be times when you
need to make a mess of things

17:16.913 --> 17:18.567
before you can fix them.

17:18.610 --> 17:20.264
Like how I'm gonna have
to cut this guy's foot off,

17:20.308 --> 17:22.092
-so we can grow him a new one.
-Wait, what was that?

17:22.136 --> 17:24.573
You'll be a great officer on
the bridge one day, but you're

17:24.616 --> 17:26.705
gonna have to risk
screwing things up to get there.

17:26.749 --> 17:29.186
-You understand?
-I do. Thanks, Doc.

17:29.230 --> 17:31.319
-Good luck growing it back.
-Hey,

17:31.362 --> 17:32.624
so you were just kidding
about my foot

17:32.668 --> 17:34.061
to make a point, right? [crying]

17:34.104 --> 17:36.541
-[yowls]
-[screams]

17:39.718 --> 17:42.156
[screams] Cave bug.
We've got cave bugs in here.

17:42.199 --> 17:44.680
Wait, look,
I think this is a door.

17:44.723 --> 17:47.074
Huh, that's not a usual thing
for a cave.

17:47.117 --> 17:49.119
Hey, there's an access panel
over here.

17:50.599 --> 17:52.557
[all gasp]

17:52.601 --> 17:55.212
YOUNG:
Whoa, what is this place?

17:55.256 --> 17:57.519
Don't know, but this
is definitely the receiver.

17:57.562 --> 18:00.087
And some kind of storage device.

18:01.305 --> 18:03.264
-Look.
-It's storing all our thoughts.

18:03.307 --> 18:05.701
It has our security clearances,
passwords,

18:05.744 --> 18:07.398
personal information.

18:07.442 --> 18:10.358
My Uncle Trent drunk-dancing
at my cousin's wedding.

18:10.401 --> 18:11.707
Damn. Get it, Trent.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.230
This thing is
a literal data mine.

18:13.274 --> 18:14.884
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
but look at the equipment.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.451
It's all Federation tech.

18:16.494 --> 18:18.888
The outpost scientists
must have installed it. But why?

18:18.931 --> 18:20.585
Unless they
and the Scrubble are...

18:20.629 --> 18:22.892
-Working together.
-We should probably

18:22.935 --> 18:24.807
-report this, huh?
-Big-time.

18:24.850 --> 18:27.201
Hey, you think there's any
chance the crazy crystal cavern

18:27.244 --> 18:28.898
is maybe boosting comms?
I don't know.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.552
-[static]
-Yeah, no, of course not.

18:30.595 --> 18:32.206
Well, you guys lucked out.

18:32.249 --> 18:34.512
You're getting the full
Cerritosexperience today.

18:34.556 --> 18:35.600
[grunts]

18:38.516 --> 18:41.780
[all whooping, shouting]

18:41.824 --> 18:43.347
[laughter]

18:46.481 --> 18:48.570
[grunting]

18:48.613 --> 18:49.919
[screams]

18:49.962 --> 18:51.312
[grunts]

18:51.355 --> 18:53.009
-[roars]
-Die!

18:53.052 --> 18:54.880
-Kearns to Carlsbad.
-Boimler to Cerritos.

18:54.924 --> 18:56.708
-Oh, I'm sorry, do you want...
-I'm sorry, did I step on...?

18:56.752 --> 18:58.493
-We need emergency-- Wow.
-Requesting immediate-- O-Okay.

18:58.536 --> 18:59.842
-I can, I can walk over there.
-[stammers] Are you sure?

18:59.885 --> 19:01.017
It's okay.
No, no, it's-it's fine.

19:06.849 --> 19:08.459
-MAIER: Just take it!
-FREEMAN: No, you take it!

19:08.503 --> 19:10.461
How about if we split it? Shaxs,
phaser this thing in half.

19:10.505 --> 19:11.897
-Now we're talking.
-How dare you?

19:11.941 --> 19:13.421
This is a sacred gift.

19:13.464 --> 19:15.031
Why don't we just
go back down to the planet

19:15.074 --> 19:16.206
and get another one?

19:16.250 --> 19:17.903
No. I'm running
the negotiations,

19:17.947 --> 19:20.602
-and I say Maier gets the rock.
-And as your guest,

19:20.645 --> 19:22.691
-I decline.
-What is wrong with you?

19:22.734 --> 19:24.040
Just take the thing and stick it

19:24.083 --> 19:25.868
in the closet
like everybody else.

19:25.911 --> 19:26.782
I'm not gonna be the captain
who wouldn't let Carol Freeman

19:26.825 --> 19:28.523
have a peace treaty gift.

19:28.566 --> 19:29.698
-FREEMAN: I don't need it.
-If someone doesn't take it,

19:29.741 --> 19:31.178
we're not signing the treaty.

19:31.221 --> 19:32.440
Someone just take
the damn thing,

19:32.483 --> 19:33.528
so we can get this over with!

19:33.571 --> 19:35.051
Everybody stop yelling!

19:35.094 --> 19:36.574
-I'm having flashbacks.
-MARINER: Hold on.

19:36.618 --> 19:38.010
Everyone, stop, stop, stop.
We just got back

19:38.054 --> 19:39.360
from the planet.
You have to stop this.

19:39.403 --> 19:40.752
Mariner,
what the hell are you doing?

19:40.796 --> 19:42.101
It's true, Commander,
we scanned...

19:42.145 --> 19:42.624
Just take the rock,
take the rock.

19:42.667 --> 19:43.277
Shut up!

19:43.320 --> 19:44.495
[all gasp]

19:44.539 --> 19:46.280
Ensign, have you lost your mind?

19:46.323 --> 19:48.282
Look at the damn rock.

19:48.325 --> 19:51.676
RANSOM:
Is that... Federation tech?

19:51.720 --> 19:53.461
Those anomalous readings?

19:53.504 --> 19:55.245
-It's an internal power source.
-MARINER: Tendi's right.

19:55.289 --> 19:56.507
These guys are working together.

19:56.551 --> 19:57.856
They have
a whole system down there

19:57.900 --> 19:59.162
where they read minds
using rocks

19:59.206 --> 20:01.120
and store it
with Federation systems.

20:01.164 --> 20:02.818
A spy device?

20:02.861 --> 20:04.907
And you both wanted it planted
in a captain's office.

20:04.950 --> 20:08.389
They would have heard top secret
communications, deployments.

20:08.432 --> 20:11.000
Well, this is, uh, preposterous.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.784
I-I want to go back to my cave
this instant.

20:12.828 --> 20:16.179
Yes, yes, and I have important
work to do at the outpost,

20:16.223 --> 20:17.702
-groundbreaking stuff.
-[gasps]

20:17.746 --> 20:19.400
-[growls]
-FREEMAN: Actually,

20:19.443 --> 20:21.793
I think I'm finally ready
to start this meeting.

20:21.837 --> 20:23.578
[groans]

20:23.621 --> 20:25.928
Great plan, genius.

20:27.582 --> 20:29.279
FREEMAN:
Captain's log, supplemental.

20:29.323 --> 20:30.933
The animosity
between the Scrubble

20:30.976 --> 20:32.804
and Outpost 76 scientists

20:32.848 --> 20:34.763
was a manufactured deception,

20:34.806 --> 20:37.592
designed to distract from
their plan to collect and sell

20:37.635 --> 20:40.899
sensitive Starfleet intelligence
on the black market.

20:40.943 --> 20:42.249
Apparently,
the scientists wanted

20:42.292 --> 20:43.772
to purchase better equipment,

20:43.815 --> 20:46.688
and the Scrubble
wanted more... rocks?

20:46.731 --> 20:49.386
[sighs] I don't get how that
would-- Whatever. Anyway,

20:49.430 --> 20:51.867
they'll both be answering
to a Federation tribunal.

20:51.910 --> 20:54.173
In recognition of their
excellent teamwork,

20:54.217 --> 20:57.264
Captain Maier and I have
authorized a small celebration

20:57.307 --> 20:58.961
for our combined crews.

20:59.004 --> 21:00.702
[chuckles] I was, like,
"Okay, Doc,

21:00.745 --> 21:02.617
"if I was brain dead
for ten minutes,

21:02.660 --> 21:04.401
"then how come I saw a koala

21:04.445 --> 21:06.229
sitting on a black mount...?"
Wait. Where are you going?

21:06.273 --> 21:07.970
Okay.

21:08.013 --> 21:09.885
Looks like it's just
you and me, old friend.

21:09.928 --> 21:12.540
[screams]
Gah, cinnamon schnapps.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.194
Innkeeper,
two Grimpari Sun Storms,

21:15.238 --> 21:17.675
one for me
and one for my mentee,

21:17.719 --> 21:19.329
who made sure she was heard.

21:19.373 --> 21:22.680
I couldn't have done it
without a great mentor.

21:22.724 --> 21:24.334
Why, thank you, Tendi.

21:24.378 --> 21:27.163
I must admit, this new role
rather suits me.

21:27.206 --> 21:28.904
A toast, to me.

21:28.947 --> 21:31.515
And, to a lesser extent,
but also worth noting, Tendi.

21:32.734 --> 21:36.128
[clears throat] Carol, I need to
apologize for my behavior today.

21:36.172 --> 21:37.608
I-I hope you don't
think less of me.

21:37.652 --> 21:39.218
Well, you and the Carlsbadteam

21:39.262 --> 21:40.524
impressed the hell out of me.

21:40.568 --> 21:42.570
In fact, I got you something.

21:42.613 --> 21:43.919
But this is gonna record my...

21:43.962 --> 21:45.747
Don't worry,
it's been neutralized.

21:45.790 --> 21:48.053
I know you think collecting
trinkets is old-school, but...

21:48.097 --> 21:51.100
I would be honored.
Are you sure you don't want it?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.667
Please, that's the little half.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.582
I kept the big one for myself.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.410
[both laugh]

21:56.453 --> 21:59.413
You guys really lived up
to your reputations today.

21:59.456 --> 22:01.763
Wow, we had no idea anyone
talked about the Cerritos.

22:01.806 --> 22:03.547
Oh, maybe not across the fleet,

22:03.591 --> 22:05.941
but you're definitely
Cali-class famous.

22:05.984 --> 22:07.246
Really? What do they say?

22:07.290 --> 22:09.379
Mariner's an unstoppable
force of nature.

22:09.423 --> 22:10.728
-Truth.
-Rutherford's a genius

22:10.772 --> 22:12.034
with crazy implant powers.

22:12.077 --> 22:13.165
-Okey dokey.
-Tendi's a ray

22:13.209 --> 22:14.732
-of optimistic sunshine.
-Aw.

22:14.776 --> 22:17.169
The only thing people
get wrong is Boimler.

22:17.213 --> 22:19.563
Let me guess, everyone thinks
I'm older, right?

22:19.607 --> 22:22.653
No, in stories you're described
as a tiny comedic robot

22:22.697 --> 22:24.046
that is always
getting into trouble.

22:24.089 --> 22:25.439
Wait, wait, wait,
what do they say?

22:25.482 --> 22:27.005
-[laughter]
-Yes, that is so accurate.

22:27.049 --> 22:28.833
-No, it's not.
-I expected you to be, like,

22:28.877 --> 22:30.357
a hovering cube or something.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.054
Guys, you got to tell people
I'm a man.

22:32.097 --> 22:33.490
Oh, no, no. Please keep telling
people he's a cube.

22:33.534 --> 22:35.144
Mariner, no. Don't do that.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.015
[robotic voice]:
Aw, Boimler wants to be people.

22:37.059 --> 22:39.366
BOIMLER: Guys, please,
please tell them I'm people.

22:39.409 --> 22:41.629
Guys, I'm people!

23:37.598 --> 23:39.121
[man imitates weapons firing]

23:41.079 --> 23:45.079
Chirp.
