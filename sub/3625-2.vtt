Good morning,
Upper East Siders.

00:02.959 --> 00:03.960
Gossip Girl here.

00:04.047 --> 00:05.788
Your one and only source

00:05.875 --> 00:09.661

of Manhattan's elite.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.620
Top story on my home page

00:11.707 --> 00:15.145
Serena van der Woodsen,
everybody's favorite "it girl"

00:15.232 --> 00:17.408
has just returned
from a mysterious absence.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.193
You'll never believe
what's on "Gossip Girl."

00:19.280 --> 00:21.586
Someone saw Serena getting off
a train at Grand Central.

00:21.673 --> 00:26.504
Everyone knows Serena,
and everyone is talking.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.767
[female #1]
'Blair, it's Serena!'

00:28.854 --> 00:29.812
Serena?

00:29.899 --> 00:31.683
And B's boyfriend Nate

00:31.770 --> 00:34.773
rumor has it, he's always
had a thing for Serena.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.949
- But you're back now.
- I didn't come back for you.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.343
Look, Blair's my best friend,
and you're her boyfriend

00:39.430 --> 00:40.910
and she loves you.

00:40.997 --> 00:43.956
Why did she leave?
Why did she return?

00:44.044 --> 00:45.567
Must be a lot of rumors
why you're back.

00:45.654 --> 00:48.265
Yeah, but none
of them mention you.

00:48.352 --> 00:49.875
He tries to take his own life

00:49.962 --> 00:51.486
and you're worried
it's gonna cost you, mom--

00:51.573 --> 00:53.749
You have no idea
what it's been like.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.925
[Chuck]
The best friend
and the boyfriend

00:56.012 --> 00:57.492
that's pretty classy, S.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.363
[Gossip Girl]
And Nate's friend Chuck

00:59.450 --> 01:01.496
won't let Serena forget
about her past.

01:01.583 --> 01:02.932
I'm trying to change.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.586
I liked you better before.

01:04.673 --> 01:06.805
And then there's Dan,
the outsider.

01:06.892 --> 01:09.156
Looks like his childhood crush
has returned.

01:09.243 --> 01:11.767
She doesn't know me.
Nobody knows me. It's cool.

01:11.854 --> 01:13.029
- Uh, Serena,
- No. No, no.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.379
Um, do you know this young man?

01:15.466 --> 01:18.078
- Oh, from last night.
- You remember me?

01:18.165 --> 01:19.775
You'd really go out
with some guy you don't know?

01:19.862 --> 01:21.777
Well, you can't be worse
than the guys I do know.

01:21.864 --> 01:24.084
- Guess whose dad is cool?
- It's a trick question.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.389
Yeah, 'cause it can't be ours.

01:25.476 --> 01:28.262
"Top ten forgotten bands
of the '90s."

01:28.349 --> 01:29.306
Yeah, check out
who's number nine.

01:29.393 --> 01:30.438
He's very proud.

01:30.525 --> 01:32.614
Hey! Hey, way to be forgotten.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.311
[Lily]
Why is my daughter going
to one of your concerts?

01:34.398 --> 01:36.792
Well, our kids were bound
to meet. It's a small island.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.186
Are you sure it's not some ploy,
you're using my daughter

01:39.273 --> 01:41.144
to get to me
now that your wife left you?

01:41.231 --> 01:42.667
[Gossip Girl]
Serena and her mystery man

01:42.754 --> 01:44.191
made a surprise appearance

01:44.278 --> 01:45.714
at Blair's
Kiss on the Lips party.

01:45.801 --> 01:48.282
[both]
Serena's here?

01:48.369 --> 01:50.501
What is she doing here?
She wasn't invited.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.764
But Serena wasn't the only one
who made an impression.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.070
Who's the newbie?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.333
Jenny made
an impression on Chuck.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.292
Let's go
and talk somewhere quieter.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.642
- Get off. Stop.
- Hey.

02:00.729 --> 02:02.731
That is my little sister!

02:02.818 --> 02:04.602
Don't you ever touch her again!

02:04.689 --> 02:06.126
Hey, your life is over, slut!

02:07.866 --> 02:10.304
She better not show
her face again.

02:10.391 --> 02:12.480
I'm actually hoping she will.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.090
You think I got a shot
at a second date?

02:14.177 --> 02:16.005
We'll talk about it in the cab.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.789
And now that S is back

02:17.876 --> 02:20.444
will the Upper East Side
ever be the same?

02:20.531 --> 02:23.621
We're all just dying
to see what happens next.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.494
[mumbling]

02:26.581 --> 02:28.060
[Gossip Girl]
And who am I?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.888
That's one secret
I'll never tell.

02:29.975 --> 02:31.499

02:31.586 --> 02:33.196
You know you love me.

02:38.070 --> 02:40.421
[instrumental music]

02:45.034 --> 02:46.644
I bet you're wondering
what Gossip Girl

02:46.731 --> 02:48.124
is doing up so early.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.213
Truth is, I never went to bed.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.997
Why waste precious time
dreaming

02:52.084 --> 02:54.130

Reading the paper in bed

03:05.010 --> 03:07.448
sipping coffee,
scrambling an egg or two.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.842
Yeah, right. We Upper East
Siders don't do lazy.

03:10.929 --> 03:13.454
Breakfast is brunch,
and it comes with champagne

03:13.541 --> 03:15.151

for his foundation.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.338
Everyone is invited.

Well, not everyone.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.606
Oh, hey. You're up.

03:35.693 --> 03:36.955
And you're checking up on me.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.178
I'm okay. Really, I'm okay.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.353
You know, I was okay
when you asked me

03:43.440 --> 03:45.137
at the party, and in the cab

03:45.225 --> 03:47.966
'when we got home, before
and after I brushed my teeth.'

03:49.272 --> 03:51.579
Look, I just feel really stupid.

03:53.102 --> 03:54.364
I mean, how could I have
actually thought

03:54.451 --> 03:56.105
that Chuck Bass
just wanted to talk to me?

03:58.629 --> 04:01.153
Because you trust people,
which is normally a good thing.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.373
Yeah, except
when it involves Chuck.

04:03.460 --> 04:04.809
Yeah, pretty much.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.943
So the real question
is, uh, how are you?

04:08.030 --> 04:09.031

04:10.946 --> 04:11.947
Why wouldn't I be okay?

of the night

04:13.078 --> 04:14.993
with Serena and the-the..

04:17.300 --> 04:18.519
Was it really that bad?

04:22.871 --> 04:24.264
This is me.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.791
So...goodnight.

Yeah. Yeah.

Um, yeah, goodnight.

Oh, I think I have brain damage.

04:47.548 --> 04:48.810
You know what, Dan,
if you had brain damage

04:48.897 --> 04:50.290
you wouldn't even know
if you had brain damage.

No, let's go, please.
Uh, Wi-Williamsburg.

H-hi.

05:04.042 --> 05:06.306
So he waved?

05:06.393 --> 05:07.611
I wouldn't have taken him
for a waver.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.004
No, he was just trying
to be funny.

05:09.091 --> 05:11.746
- 'Maybe he's shy.'
- Or he hated me.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.444
No guy in the history
of the world has ever hated you.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.228
She probably thinks
I hate her now.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.753
I've waited my entire adolescent
life for a date with this girl

05:18.840 --> 05:21.103
you know,
Serena van der Woodsen.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.713
And I decide to close
the evening with a wave.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.715
- It was a nice wave.
- 'At the end of a date?'

05:24.802 --> 05:26.195
Come on, there's no such thing.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.371
And you only get one shot
with a girl like Serena.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.242
I got mine, and I blew it.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.114
Which means
you have nothing to lose.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.681
No, nothing except
my last shred of dignity.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.552
Oh, no. I think that's gone.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.471
You're right.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.517
You know what? I'm just,
I'm gonna go talk to her.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.128
I'm gonna apologize
for the wave.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.217
I'm gonna tell her
how much I like her

05:48.304 --> 05:49.958
and I'm gonna ask
for a second shot.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.438
No, I'm gonna get a second shot.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.353
- Yeah, you are.
- Yeah.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.050
Wait, wait, wait.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.182
I love the plan, but, uh,
you need a better outfit.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.882
And maybe a shower.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.583
Whatever.
It's probably for the best.

06:06.670 --> 06:10.282
The last thing I need
in my life is a new guy.

06:10.370 --> 06:14.199
He was just so smart, though,
and-and funny.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.592
It sounds like you like him.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.768
And really nice.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.599
God, Blair was so mean
to me last night.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.253
I don't even know why. Whatever.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.429
I'm sure if we talk
about it, we can work it out.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.824

go over there.

just stay away.'

06:35.699 --> 06:37.092
I don't want
to see Serena at school

06:37.179 --> 06:38.876
and she better not show
at brunch today.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.356
You're really mad at Serena.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.966
Yeah, I hope you never get
that mad at us.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.446
Well, you would never do
what Serena did.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.622
- No, never.
- Of course not.

06:45.709 --> 06:47.711
I wonder
if Nate remembered brunch.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.713
It would be so wrong for me
to show up without my boyfriend

have a reason to be here
