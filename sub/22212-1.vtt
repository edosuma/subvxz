[narrator] Previously on Riverdale:

00:09.884 --> 00:12.637
If we don't face the reality
of who and what we are,

00:12.721 --> 00:15.098
what happened to Jason
could happen again.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.933
Or something even worse.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.562
"I'm gonna be with Jason"?
Where would Cheryl go to be with Jason?

00:20.645 --> 00:21.855
[ice cracks]

00:21.938 --> 00:22.981
-No! Cheryl!
-Cheryl!

00:23.982 --> 00:27.277
It's the only way we can truly
start over. Be purified.

00:29.029 --> 00:33.575
Your father's facing serious jail time.
Your mom's overextended and out of state.

00:33.658 --> 00:36.661
[tall boy] Serpents take care
of their own. We got your back.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.330
Juggie?
He's moving in with a foster family.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.083
Why are you trying to push Fred
out of this deal?

00:42.167 --> 00:45.545
Your father is coming back.
He and Fred will not get along.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.380
I'm not selling, Hermione.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.673
[man] Give me your wallet!

00:50.550 --> 00:51.968
[gunshot]

00:55.722 --> 00:58.016
[Jughead] Our story continues.

00:59.225 --> 01:02.479
The mayor's jubilee was supposed
to change everything,

01:03.271 --> 01:04.439
be a new start.

01:05.565 --> 01:09.861
But when we woke up the next morning,
Riverdale was still, at its heart,

01:10.695 --> 01:11.780
a haunted town.

01:13.364 --> 01:15.575
Meanwhile, Archie Andrews,

01:16.159 --> 01:18.661
who doesn't even have
a driver's license yet,

01:19.454 --> 01:23.166
is at this very moment careening
down the streets of Riverdale,

01:23.249 --> 01:25.752
-trying to outrace death.
-[Fred groaning]

01:25.835 --> 01:27.670
[Archie] Hold on, Dad. Hold on.

01:29.964 --> 01:32.175
Dad, we're almost there.
They're gonna fix you up.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.052
Stay with me, Dad. Stay with me.

01:36.304 --> 01:40.266
[Jughead]
Now, I don't believe in miracles, usually.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.978
But it was a miracle that Archie
got his dad to Riverdale General

01:44.062 --> 01:45.438
without wrecking the truck.

01:46.481 --> 01:47.524
[Archie] Help, please.

01:48.024 --> 01:48.983
Help! Hey!

01:49.067 --> 01:50.902
Someone help me and my dad!

01:50.985 --> 01:51.861
[nurse] Gurney!

01:51.945 --> 01:54.364
-[Masters] What happened to him?
-[Archie] He was shot.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.200
Does he have medical problems?
Any conditions?

01:57.283 --> 01:59.661
[Fred wheezes]

02:00.286 --> 02:02.497
[nurse]
Can you hear me? Tell me your name.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.124
His name's Fred Andrews.

02:04.707 --> 02:08.128
-One bullet hole, no exit wound.
-[nurse] Massive blood loss.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.172
Sir, I'm sorry. I need you to stay here.

02:16.469 --> 02:19.806

[monitor beeping]

02:27.480 --> 02:30.608
I'm right here, Dad. I'm right here. Okay.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.110
I'm right here.

02:33.444 --> 02:34.404
Right here.

02:34.487 --> 02:38.575
-Dad? What gives? Take the picture.
-The ceremony starts in ten minutes.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.577
Yeah, Dad, what's taking so long?

02:40.660 --> 02:43.246
I-- I just can't believe we're here.

02:43.830 --> 02:49.294
Archie. We're at your graduation. I--
I didn't think I'd live to see this day.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.462
Yeah, except you didn't, Mr. A.

02:52.171 --> 02:53.006
What?

02:53.089 --> 02:55.383
You didn't live to see this day.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.427
Don't you remember? In Pop's?

02:58.219 --> 02:59.679
[door bell jingles]

03:04.601 --> 03:05.852
[Veronica giggling]

03:07.478 --> 03:08.688
Everybody, down!

03:09.439 --> 03:10.273
[gunshot]

03:16.654 --> 03:20.491
Good morning. What did you
and your friends do after the jubilee?

03:20.575 --> 03:21.743
We went to Pop's.

03:22.118 --> 03:26.080
And then Jughead and I went back
to FP's trailer.

03:28.082 --> 03:33.796
Oh. Betty. If that beanie-wearing cad
defiled you, at least,

03:33.880 --> 03:38.509
-please tell me that you were safe.
-What? No, Mom, we didn't.

03:38.593 --> 03:42.805
I mean, we almost did,
but then we were interrupted.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.974
-Thank God.
-By the Southside Serpents.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.019
-Excuse me? By those thugs? Oh, see?
-[clears throat]

03:48.102 --> 03:51.898
I knew that Jughead was gonna follow
in FP's criminal footsteps.

03:51.981 --> 03:56.110
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree,
not when there's a snake in its limbs.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.737
[cell phone ringing]

03:57.820 --> 03:59.572
If that's Snake Plissken,
I want him blocked.

03:59.656 --> 04:01.407
-It's Archie.
-Block him, too.

04:01.991 --> 04:02.909
Hey.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.165
What is that?

04:09.749 --> 04:12.627
Uh, a chocolate almond croissant
from Bean &amp; Beluga.

04:13.127 --> 04:16.005
-I only have the one.
-The other thing, Veronica.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.549
Oh, this. A mimosa.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.302
There was a bottle of champagne
in the fridge.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.680
Okay, that was a bottle of Cristal
for your father.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.598
[cell phone ringing]

04:25.682 --> 04:26.641
I have to take this.

04:26.724 --> 04:30.353
-If that's your guest from last night--
-It's Betty. Hello?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.356
[cell phone rings]

04:33.439 --> 04:34.274
Hey, Betty.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.369
[engine revs]

05:06.889 --> 05:07.765
[Veronica] Arch?

05:08.516 --> 05:09.517
Oh, my God.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.353
My God.

05:19.235 --> 05:23.990
I came out of the bathroom
and there was this man, a thief...

05:26.159 --> 05:28.453
wearing this hood,
with a gun on Pop Tate.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.830
He pointed it at my dad and he fired.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.708
-[Veronica] Oh, my God, Archie.
-And then he--

05:38.087 --> 05:40.339
-And then he what?
-And then he bolted.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.009
And I was holding my dad.

05:43.092 --> 05:47.055
Pop Tate called an ambulance,
and it didn't come so I drove here--

05:47.138 --> 05:49.265
I should've waited. I made it worse.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.184
No, dude. Are you kidding me?

05:51.726 --> 05:55.480
You saved your dad's life.
First Cheryl, and now your dad.

05:55.563 --> 05:59.901
Keep this up, you'll need a superhero
name. Like Pureheart the Powerful.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.195
There isn't any new information.

06:02.278 --> 06:05.198
Your dad's in surgery.
He'll be there for a while.

06:05.782 --> 06:09.410
Archie, have you spoken
to your mother about any of this yet?

06:10.161 --> 06:12.080
No. No, I haven't called her.

06:12.663 --> 06:13.790
I'll be right back.

06:16.834 --> 06:17.668
[sighs]

06:20.379 --> 06:23.758
-What?
-Mom, do not start this.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.677
-Start what?
-Of course, I can't help but wonder

06:26.761 --> 06:30.681
if your Southside associates had
anything to do with what happened.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.600
-Do not do this.
-[Jughead] Unbelievable.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.937
At least you can't accuse my father.
He's in jail.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.939
Oh, my God. I can't handle this.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.528
Hey, Mom, how are you?

06:45.863 --> 06:47.824
Good. Yeah, good. We're, uh-- We--

06:52.245 --> 06:55.039
Actually, Mom, we're not.
We're in trouble here.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.000
Dad's in the hospital.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.087
There was a robbery.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.047
And he was shot.

07:05.967 --> 07:10.263
I don't know what's gonna happen,
but you should come here, in case...

07:12.265 --> 07:14.100
In case we have to say goodbye.

07:31.742 --> 07:33.578
-Sheriff.
-How's your dad doing?

07:33.661 --> 07:34.996
He's still in surgery.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.124
I know this is a hell of a time for you.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.960
Perhaps we could go somewhere
and talk.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.753
Is it cool if I tag along?

07:42.837 --> 07:45.256
-If you don't mind--
-That would be great.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.511
[Archie]
He was maybe 5'10", 160 pounds or so.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.974
And he was wearing dark pants
and a dark jacket?

07:55.975 --> 07:59.145
Anything on that jacket?
Symbol or insignia?

07:59.228 --> 08:02.482
-You mean like a snake?
-It was just a jacket. No snake.

08:03.065 --> 08:06.360
-And this ski mask he had on--
-No, it's not a ski mask.

08:06.903 --> 08:10.364
It's a hood. Homemade,
like he'd cut the eyes out himself.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.408
And the guy's eyes were green.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.578
[Keller] Now, Pop Tate had a fairly
good idea of what happened

08:15.661 --> 08:20.583
up until when your father was shot.
And then, well, there are some gaps.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.877
And I need you to help me fill those.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.838
So, what did he do? Our masked man?

08:28.508 --> 08:29.759
After he shot my dad?

08:32.720 --> 08:33.554
He--

08:33.638 --> 08:35.306
[door bell jingles]

08:39.477 --> 08:41.896
Nothing. He shot my dad and ran out.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.566
Who did this, sheriff?

08:46.651 --> 08:48.778
Archie, it's too early to speculate.

08:48.861 --> 08:52.782
But he was probably out of his head
on meth or the jingle-jangle,

08:52.865 --> 08:56.786
some Southside lowlife
that was just looking for a cash grab.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.038
How much did he get?
How much cash?

08:59.121 --> 09:01.165
We're waiting to hear from Pop Tate.

09:01.541 --> 09:06.420
Since this is Riverdale, I have to ask,
what if robbery wasn't the motive?

09:06.504 --> 09:09.257
-What else could it be?
-[Keller] I suppose it could be

09:09.340 --> 09:11.676
someone who has a grudge
against your dad,

09:11.759 --> 09:14.136
wanted to make it look like a robbery.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.597
I mean, it's just too early to tell.

09:16.681 --> 09:20.309
[Veronica] There are things no one
does better than Veronica Lodge.

09:20.393 --> 09:24.063
Makeovers, party planning, dance-offs,

09:24.647 --> 09:27.149
dropping vintage bon mots
as if they were bonbons.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.067
[chuckles]

09:28.568 --> 09:31.779
Conversely,
there are things that I'm not good at.

09:32.738 --> 09:36.826
Grief, bedside vigils,
comforting boyfriends.

09:36.909 --> 09:41.122
-That's the old Veronica talking.
-Old Veronica would've bolted by now,

09:41.205 --> 09:44.375
but new Veronica doesn't want
to let Archie down.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.668
And you won't.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.713
Oh, and speaking of...

09:50.464 --> 09:54.385
Archie. Hey, were you not telling
Sheriff Keller something?

09:55.511 --> 09:59.348
My dad told me he and Mrs. Lodge
fired the Serpents on their crew.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.267
I know your dad vouches for them,

10:01.350 --> 10:04.312
but what if one was pissed off
enough to do something?

10:05.313 --> 10:07.148
Let me see what I can find out.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.358
[Archie] Thanks, bro.

10:12.570 --> 10:15.448
Archie? I'm Steven Masters,
your father's doctor.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.825
-[Archie] How is he?
-Well, we got the bullet out

10:17.908 --> 10:19.619
and stopped the internal bleeding.

10:20.244 --> 10:24.248
But what's most worrisome
is he's not breathing on his own yet.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.166
I need to see him.

10:25.249 --> 10:28.419
And you will.
Soon as we've got him set in a room.

10:28.502 --> 10:31.464
-An hour or two, at most.
-Until then, what am I to do? Nothing?

10:31.547 --> 10:36.052
Maybe-- Maybe you should go home
and get changed.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.553
No. I'm not leaving.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.847
No, Archie, wait. Veronica's right.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.434
Your dad's clothes and belongings.
Everything he had on him.

10:43.517 --> 10:47.188
Another reason to go. You can get
your dad a change of clothes.

10:47.271 --> 10:51.192
-Veronica will go with you. Right, Vee?
-We'll hold the fort down here.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.362
Archie, try not to worry.
Your dad is strong stock.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.155
He's a fighter.

10:56.697 --> 11:00.034
Fred Andrews isn't one
to leave unfinished business.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.162
[Archie] Dad, the car's waiting.
You're gonna be late.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.914
I'm not ready to go, Archie.

11:05.373 --> 11:07.208
Something doesn't feel right.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.919
I'm gonna be fine, Dad.
Don't worry about me.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.838
It's what I do, son.
It's what I've always done.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.634
Yeah, and you deserve a break.
Okay? I'll handle things for now.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.389
It doesn't feel right. It's...

11:23.099 --> 11:24.308
It's too soon.

11:26.018 --> 11:29.688
You can't change your mind now, Dad.
They're waiting for you.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.316
-Who's waiting?
-Uncle Oscar. Grandpa Artie.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.405
What are you talking about, son?
They're dead.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.489
[banging on door]

11:39.031 --> 11:39.949
That's them.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.117
[banging continues]

11:46.497 --> 11:48.499
[monitor beeping]

12:00.719 --> 12:01.846
[Vegas barks, then whines]

12:04.515 --> 12:05.724
Hey, Vegas.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.436
Nobody's walked you, have they?

12:09.562 --> 12:12.356
I bet you must be wondering
what the hell happened.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.817
Come on. Let's go for a walk.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.946
-Wait, Archie. What are you doing?
-I have to walk Vegas.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.325
Like that? You look like
you're auditioning for The Shining.

12:23.409 --> 12:28.080
-No, take your shower. I'll walk him.
-Veronica. You ever walked a dog?

12:29.790 --> 12:32.543
I've had dogs walked for me.
Does that count?

12:34.086 --> 12:38.466
Before we got Vegas, my dad was like,
"He's gonna be your dog, little Archie.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.386
Your responsibility.
Are you ready to walk him,

12:42.470 --> 12:46.891
give him his food, fill his water bowl,
take care of him when he gets sick?"

12:47.892 --> 12:52.646
I wanted him so bad, I was like,
"Yes, Dad, I'm ready. I'm so ready."

12:52.730 --> 12:55.649
Cutest origin story ever. And?

12:56.192 --> 12:59.528
And now, when I get home late
from football practice...

13:01.572 --> 13:03.240
my dad's already walked him.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.119
Saturday mornings,
Dad takes him out so I can sleep in.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.915
Every time Vegas gets sick,
Dad always goes with us to the vet.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.502
The truth is, no one loves Vegas
more than my Dad.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.267
[tall boy] Got nervous when you said
to meet at the hospital.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.480
Wondering about when you said
the Serpents had my back.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.067
Does that extend
to a guy who's like my brother?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.653
And a man
who's like a second father to me?

13:41.362 --> 13:45.324
-What do you need?
-Fred, my buddy's dad, was shot...

13:46.325 --> 13:49.620
during a robbery at Pop's.
The guy was in a black hood.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.455
Serpents don't wear masks.

13:51.539 --> 13:55.292
Yeah, I get it. But some Serpents
were working for Fred Andrews

13:55.376 --> 14:00.005
when he decided to let them go.
Maybe someone took it personally?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.508
You guys know every hidey-hole
in town.

14:03.592 --> 14:06.595
Someone has to have heard
about what went down.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.513
All right.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.267
We'll knock some heads. Let you know.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.499
[shower running]

14:40.296 --> 14:41.130
Archie?

14:42.089 --> 14:42.923
You okay?

14:43.674 --> 14:44.550
I'm okay.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.677
I'm fine.

Of course, all any of us can think about
is Mr. Andrews.

15:56.413 --> 15:59.416
But if we weren't so focused
on his well-being,

15:59.500 --> 16:01.543
-I'd be asking if you--
-We didn't.

16:02.127 --> 16:05.339
Jughead and I didn't do it,
if that's what you were asking.

16:05.422 --> 16:08.759
-But, wait, like, heh, nothing?
-He told me he loved me.

16:08.842 --> 16:12.262
Wait, what?
Jughead Jones said "I love you"?

16:12.346 --> 16:16.308
-Mr. I'm-Weird-I'm-a-Weirdo--?
-And I told him I loved him back.

16:17.017 --> 16:17.851
Wow.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.855
-And then things got complicated--
-Weird?

16:21.939 --> 16:25.901
In a "my boyfriend may be joining
the Serpents" kind of way.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.780
Betty, no. No way. Did you learn
nothing from me and Joaquin?

16:29.863 --> 16:32.116
Oh, come on. Joaquin was... nice.

16:32.199 --> 16:36.537
When he wasn't dumping bodies in
Sweetwater River or mopping up blood.

16:40.207 --> 16:41.250
What the hell?

16:49.216 --> 16:50.050
Cheryl?

16:56.682 --> 16:57.933
[Betty] Cheryl?

16:58.892 --> 17:01.145
What's going on? Is that your mom?
What happened?

17:01.228 --> 17:05.733
Oh. Haven't you heard? There was
a terrible fire at Thornhill last night.

17:06.734 --> 17:09.069
I might've perished
if not for Mommy's heroics.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.739
Oh, my God, is this the apocalypse?

17:11.822 --> 17:17.244
After my... ordeal at Sweetwater River,
I was asleep when the fire started.

17:17.786 --> 17:20.456
They think it was a breeze
knocking over a lit candle.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.792
Mommy got home
and rushed headlong into the blaze,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.669
risking her life to save mine.

17:26.628 --> 17:30.049
She suffered third-degree burns
and acute smoke inhalation.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.802
What are you two doing here?

17:41.226 --> 17:42.102
[sighs]

17:43.145 --> 17:44.271
What's going on?

17:44.354 --> 17:48.233
I took your dad's things out of the bag.
I hope that's okay.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.281
Where's, uh--? Where's his wallet?

17:55.657 --> 18:00.370
I'm... not sure.
That's all that was in there.

18:00.454 --> 18:04.374
Well, it would've been in his coat.
Are you sure you didn't see it?

18:04.458 --> 18:09.254
I didn't. Maybe it was in the truck?
Or back at the hospital?

18:09.338 --> 18:11.715
No, this is everything they had.
You heard the nurse.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.385
Okay, well, worst-case scenario,
it's just a wallet.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.554
Everything important is in that wallet.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.724
-He doesn't go anywhere without it.
-For all we know, it's at Pop's.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.102
-Why did you even open the bag?
-I thought--

18:24.269 --> 18:27.147
-I wanted to help--
-No, seriously. Why are we here?

18:27.731 --> 18:31.110
Veronica, I didn't ask you to come.
I didn't want to come here and--

18:32.528 --> 18:34.404
[sighs] Just forget it.

18:35.572 --> 18:39.910
Just go. I'll take care of this.
I'll see you at the hospital or call you.

18:43.831 --> 18:46.125
-You really want me to go?
-I do. Yeah.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.186
-I'm sorry, no.
-What?

19:07.062 --> 19:09.773
I'm sorry, but I'm not going.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.735
Archie,
you shouldn't be alone right now.

19:14.319 --> 19:18.157
You're angry and hurting
and probably terrified.

19:18.240 --> 19:19.324
I know I am.

19:20.826 --> 19:21.910
So, go ahead.

19:21.994 --> 19:26.415
Yell at me and try to push me away,
but I'm not going anywhere.

19:31.962 --> 19:32.963
[whispering] Okay?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.883
-Come here.
-[sobs]

19:35.966 --> 19:37.509
Come here.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.269
[ringing]

19:49.855 --> 19:52.274
-Is it the hospital?
-It's Sheriff Keller.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.194
Hi, sheriff?

19:57.070 --> 19:58.322
What, right now?

19:59.406 --> 20:00.657
Come on in, guys.

20:00.741 --> 20:04.077
So, this is who we've picked up so far.

20:05.245 --> 20:08.957
All have a history of armed robbery
or some other violent crime.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.959
So, you feeling up for this?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.045
Yeah.

20:13.587 --> 20:14.421
All right.

20:15.964 --> 20:16.882
Put them on.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.684
One, step forward.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.693
No.

20:36.777 --> 20:37.819
[Keller] Step back.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.989
Number 2, step forward.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.121
No.

20:50.165 --> 20:51.124
[Keller] Step back.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.793
Three, step forward.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.213
No.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.845
-[jingles]
-No.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.892
-Archie's where?
-[Veronica] At the station,

21:08.976 --> 21:12.062
doing a lineup.
He asked me to be here with Fred.

21:12.145 --> 21:15.065
That's gonna be traumatizing.
We should go there.

21:15.148 --> 21:18.568
Can you do me a favor?
Mr. Andrews' wallet is missing.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.153
We're thinking it might be at Pop's.

21:20.237 --> 21:24.032
That,
or the guy who shot Fred might have it.

21:24.116 --> 21:28.203
If it's just some rando robbing Pop's, he
probably took the money and got rid of it.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.915
Unless it wasn't just some rando.
Unless it was premeditated.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.459
What? Is that an actual theory?

21:35.085 --> 21:37.004
Not according to Sheriff Keller.

21:37.087 --> 21:41.174
But if you ask me, people have grudges,
people have enemies.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.969
Think of where we live.
Fathers are killing sons.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.971
It's conceivable this was a hit.

21:46.054 --> 21:50.100
Okay. Or the wallet's just at Pop's,
so, we'll check it out, Vee.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.359
-[Betty] A motorcycle?
-Hop on.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.736
Without a helmet?

22:01.486 --> 22:03.697
You can use mine. Or we can walk.

22:04.448 --> 22:08.118
We can take a bus or...
Or we can call your mom.

22:08.201 --> 22:11.997
Oh, no, just... go slow, okay?

22:12.581 --> 22:13.749
Oh.

22:13.832 --> 22:17.961
No, no, no. It's actually
much more dangerous if we go slow.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.881
You are gonna need to hold tight.

22:20.964 --> 22:22.507
[engine revs]

22:27.429 --> 22:28.472
[door closes]

22:33.393 --> 22:36.146
[speaking in Latin]

22:41.610 --> 22:43.028
What are we praying for?

22:43.945 --> 22:46.615
Fred's speedy recovery
or a quick death?

22:47.949 --> 22:50.035
Veronica,
why on earth would I pray for that?

22:50.702 --> 22:55.415
Jughead said that what happened
to Mr. Andrews may have been... a hit.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.753
But who would be evil enough to do that?
And why?

23:00.295 --> 23:04.841
I remembered how you wanted Fred
to sell his share back to you and Daddy.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.385
Because he and Daddy
wouldn't get along.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.013
Which is a threat if I ever heard one.

23:10.097 --> 23:13.183
You are so determined
to paint your father as a villain,

23:13.266 --> 23:17.729
you assume he must've put a hit
on Fred Andrews. Brilliant.

23:19.815 --> 23:20.649
Not him.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.484
You.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.571
I don't think you're an innocent pawn,
Mom.

23:27.155 --> 23:31.243
I think you're Daddy's eyes and ears
on the ground, calling the shots.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.829
You genuinely believe that.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.206
If the Manolo Blahnik fits.

23:44.756 --> 23:48.718
Mija, your disrespect
will no longer be tolerated.

23:48.802 --> 23:52.556
Not by me, and certainly not
by your father when he comes home.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.182
So, a word of advice?

23:54.724 --> 23:56.810
Get back in line with this family.

23:57.352 --> 24:00.313
Because you are a Lodge
before anything else.

24:03.775 --> 24:06.736
Now, I should slap you
for what you're insinuating...

24:07.654 --> 24:09.364
but I'm not a violent person.

24:18.665 --> 24:19.833
[Archie] Thanks, Reggie.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.960
Bulldogs are here for you.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.629
And so are the Pussycats.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.424
We're sending your dad our prayers,

24:27.507 --> 24:29.676
giving him as many
of our nine lives as he needs.

24:29.759 --> 24:30.844
Thanks, Josie.

24:30.927 --> 24:34.306
Veronica said that you were down
at the sheriff's station?

24:34.389 --> 24:36.183
That maybe they got the guy?

24:37.058 --> 24:39.186
Yeah, but it wasn't him.
He's still out there.

24:39.811 --> 24:40.854
[Masters] Archie.

24:42.230 --> 24:45.400
-He's in Room 12. You can see him.
-Okay, great.

24:46.109 --> 24:49.404
Listen, he hasn't woken up yet.
But talk to him.

24:49.487 --> 24:53.325
Coax him back. Keep it positive.
That can make all the difference.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.002
[monitor beeping]

25:04.961 --> 25:05.795
[Archie] Dad?

25:06.922 --> 25:09.925
I don't know if you can hear me.
Hopefully, you can.

25:11.218 --> 25:16.514
I'm only supposed to talk about good
things, which limits my options, but--

25:21.102 --> 25:22.354
What can I tell you?

25:24.356 --> 25:26.858
I'm doing it, Dad.
I'm asking her tonight.

25:27.442 --> 25:30.946
Would you look at that?
You know, Veronica's gonna love it.

25:31.029 --> 25:33.365
Well, she better. She picked it out.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.533
Yeah, that sounds about right.

25:36.117 --> 25:39.913
Pop, you are not gonna believe this.
Archie is getting married.

25:40.497 --> 25:44.459
Is that right? Well, well, well.
Time dies.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.169
What?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.140
[bell jingles]

26:00.517 --> 26:01.476
[bell jingles]

26:02.519 --> 26:03.395
Oh, my God.

26:07.148 --> 26:08.692
[clattering]

26:09.567 --> 26:12.529
Sorry, kids, we, uh-- We're closed today.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.655
-There was--
-Pop.

26:14.614 --> 26:16.324
We heard about what happened.

26:16.408 --> 26:20.078
We got back from the hospital,
to look for Mr. Andrews' wallet.

26:20.161 --> 26:22.247
-Is he--?
-He's out of surgery.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.125
We'll know more when he wakes up.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.460
The police have already looked,

26:27.544 --> 26:30.964
but if you wanna double-check,
he was in that booth there.

26:34.384 --> 26:39.180
So, uh... what happened, Pop?
From your point of view?

26:39.264 --> 26:40.974
[Pop] I wish I knew.

26:41.683 --> 26:44.561
As soon as that gun turned off of me, I--

26:44.644 --> 26:49.065
God help me, I dove.
I don't even remember calling the police.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.233
But I guess I did.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.736
How much cash did the creep
end up taking?

26:52.819 --> 26:53.737
Not a penny.

26:55.238 --> 26:56.740
[snaps fingers] I knew it.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.950
What kind of thief shoots up a joint,

26:59.034 --> 27:02.537
-then doesn't take a single dollar bill?
-[Pop] He wasn't a thief.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.707
This place has been robbed
many times.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.460
Bricks through the windows, even,
during the riots.

27:09.002 --> 27:12.297
I've looked plenty of thugs in the eye.
But this man?

27:13.590 --> 27:15.425
His goal was something else.

27:16.926 --> 27:17.886
Darker.

27:20.347 --> 27:23.433
It was like the angel of death
had come to Riverdale.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.063
Jeez, Pop, lighten up.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.441
You sound like the cranky old guy
in the Friday the 13th movies.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.486
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

27:35.236 --> 27:36.738
The wallet's not here.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.324
Hey. You kids hungry?

27:39.407 --> 27:41.201
-Always.
-No, we're good, Pop.

27:52.837 --> 27:56.800
In times of crisis...
some people lose their appetite.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.218
But me?

27:59.177 --> 28:00.720
Mine increases tenfold.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.017
I haven't eaten since last night.

28:07.560 --> 28:12.982
I don't want to be thinking about this
while Mr. Andrews is how he is...

28:14.442 --> 28:17.987
but last night,
when you put on the Serpent jacket...

28:19.322 --> 28:20.865
-[sighs]
-it meant something, Jug.

28:20.949 --> 28:24.369
It meant there were ten biker dudes
standing in front of me

28:24.452 --> 28:28.456
-and I didn't think I could say no.
-It fit you like a glove, Jug.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.584
Like a second skin.
And the look on your face?

28:31.668 --> 28:33.711
You weren't acting for the Serpents.

28:33.795 --> 28:37.006
Now you're riding a motorcycle,
which you've never done.

28:37.090 --> 28:40.885
Betty, I'm not a Serpent, okay? That's--

28:41.261 --> 28:43.096
Might be my dad's life,
but it's not mine.

28:43.179 --> 28:46.224
What about your foster family?
They're from the Southside.

28:46.307 --> 28:49.269
If they have ties to the Serpents,
they could try to--

28:49.352 --> 28:50.311
Indoctrinate me?

28:52.480 --> 28:54.899
Don't worry.
I've made a decision about that.

28:54.983 --> 28:58.820
They'll cover for me with my social
worker, but I'm not staying with them.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.322
-I'm gonna be at the trailer.
-What? Why?

29:01.406 --> 29:02.449
Betty.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.327

29:06.411 --> 29:08.997
Archie almost lost his dad.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.039
He may still.

29:10.582 --> 29:15.044
Facing facts, my dad is going away
for a long-ass time.

29:15.628 --> 29:20.258
Wearing that jacket and riding his bike,
living in the trailer...

29:23.762 --> 29:25.138
It does mean something.

29:26.723 --> 29:30.310
I was hoping that it means I'll always
be close to him, no matter what.

29:30.977 --> 29:34.981
I don't wanna see you get hurt.
Or hurting someone else.

29:35.064 --> 29:39.611
Not because you did it on purpose,
but because that's the Serpents' world.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.197
That's how they live. Isn't it?

29:49.204 --> 29:50.038
[Betty sighs]

29:52.123 --> 29:54.125
[Cheryl] Good. You're awake.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.128
Now here's the reals, Baby Jane.

29:58.421 --> 30:02.091
I'm telling everyone you ran back
into that inferno to save me,

30:02.175 --> 30:04.719
not that hideous family portrait you love.

30:04.803 --> 30:10.809
And that what happened at Thornhill
was a terrible, tragic accident.

30:12.143 --> 30:16.481
If you tell anyone the truth
about what happened with the fire,

30:16.564 --> 30:20.985
I'll tell everyone about what really
happened in the barn with Daddy.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.655
[grunting]

30:24.781 --> 30:29.869
You were cruel to me, Mother.
It was abuse, plain and simple.

30:31.663 --> 30:34.040
So, henceforth...

30:35.041 --> 30:38.503
if you breathe,
it is because I give you air.

30:39.379 --> 30:43.007
If you drink, it is because
I've poured your cup myself.

30:43.967 --> 30:49.264
And if you move, it is quietly,
and with my blessing.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.766
[gasping, then breathing deeply]

30:54.978 --> 30:58.147
Things are going to be different now,
Mommy. Better.

31:00.525 --> 31:01.693
You'll see.

31:11.870 --> 31:16.708
For your dad, when he wakes up,
which he will. Very, very soon.

31:19.669 --> 31:20.712

-I didn't. I sent Smithers.

31:31.806 --> 31:35.977
You are the best girlfriend ever.

31:37.687 --> 31:40.148

-Why do you say that?

31:44.819 --> 31:47.322
Can I, uh--? Can I tell you about this--?

31:48.740 --> 31:51.743

with my dad?

31:51.826 --> 31:53.286
-Yes.
-[Jughead] Who's hungry?

and onion rings.

-[woman] Excuse me.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.425
Your dad would be so proud of you, Arch.

32:07.967 --> 32:12.221
Yeah, you've really been
just a rock-star god through all of this.

32:13.514 --> 32:15.391
Archie, what is it?

32:15.934 --> 32:17.101
Talk to us.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.020
Maybe we can help.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.485
[Archie sighs]

32:25.568 --> 32:29.197
Guys, there's something
I haven't told you, because I'm so...

32:29.864 --> 32:30.740
I'm so ashamed.

32:33.826 --> 32:37.413
After the guy fired, I should've rushed
to my dad straightaway.

32:37.497 --> 32:41.000
Or I should have tackled the guy,
but I was-- I was paralyzed.

32:46.589 --> 32:49.717
I didn't move,
not even when the guy walked up to me.

32:49.801 --> 32:53.554
And he held his gun to my head,
and I just closed my eyes.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.015
I don't know how long. Long enough

32:56.099 --> 32:58.643
for the guy
to have taken my dad's wallet, I guess.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.398
But I didn't open them
until I heard the bell.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.108
-[bell jingles]
-[Archie] Pop's bell.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.944
Which meant he was gone.

33:16.327 --> 33:19.122
-There was nothing you could've done.
-Not true.

33:19.205 --> 33:23.751
I could've done anything, to comfort
my dad, to get the gun away from the guy.

33:24.752 --> 33:25.920
I was a coward.

33:27.505 --> 33:30.717
And now me and my dad,
we're witnesses. Pop Tate, too.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.470
This guy may have my dad's wallet.
All his information.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.267
What if he comes back?

34:02.582 --> 34:04.333
Cheryl? What are you doing?

34:05.334 --> 34:08.087
Paying you back for saving me
at Sweetwater River.

34:09.464 --> 34:12.175
You gave me the kiss of life,
Archie Andrews.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.136
Now I've given it to your dad.

34:19.015 --> 34:20.808
He's going to be just fine.

34:24.979 --> 34:25.813
Toodles.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.119
I've been thinking
about what I can say to you.

34:40.203 --> 34:43.289
I started imagining
what we would've talked about at Pop's

34:43.372 --> 34:45.124
if things hadn't gone to hell.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.668
You would've asked me about Veronica.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.379
I would've told you
how crazy I am about her.

34:54.008 --> 34:55.593
You would've said, "That's great,

34:56.385 --> 35:00.098
but take it slow, Archie.
No one's getting married."

-Archie.
-Whether or not Sheriff Keller

don't worry.

36:42.783 --> 36:46.913

is ever gonna happen again. I swear it.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.835

To protect you.

-You sure I can't give you a ride home?
-I think if my mom saw me

she'd come out with a shotgun.

was gonna let Hiram Lodge's bitch

-fire his crew, it's good he was gutshot.
-We thought we might press him.

38:11.247 --> 38:13.332
-See if it was all just talk.
-And?

38:13.416 --> 38:17.086
And after a lengthy
cross-examination,

38:17.169 --> 38:20.006
yeah, we've concluded,
he was just being a loudmouth.

If he didn't do anything?
