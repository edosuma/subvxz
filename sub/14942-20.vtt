00:16.487 --> 00:18.688

(Squeaks)

01:09.840 --> 01:11.201
(Megan laughs)

01:11.202 --> 01:13.643
Making friends?

01:13.644 --> 01:15.245
Filthy creatures.

01:15.246 --> 01:17.607
Oh, it's all part of
the food chain, bud.

01:17.608 --> 01:20.610
Just be glad you're at the top,

01:20.611 --> 01:22.752
right below me.

01:22.753 --> 01:24.314
Her name is Niki shumaker.

01:24.315 --> 01:26.116
She's 18 years old.

01:26.117 --> 01:28.218
Her student I.D. Tells me she's
a freshman at hoyt university

01:28.219 --> 01:30.590
and her credit card
and cash tells me

01:30.591 --> 01:32.192
this wasn't a robbery.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.463
The bartender
discovered the body

01:33.464 --> 01:34.824
just after closing
time, called it in.

01:34.825 --> 01:38.828
Immediate cause of death
appears to be exsanguination.

01:38.829 --> 01:40.370
Killer slashed her throat.

01:40.371 --> 01:41.871
We searched the dumpsters,

01:41.872 --> 01:43.333
canvassed the area for a knife.

01:43.334 --> 01:45.175
Nothing turned up.

01:45.176 --> 01:46.606
I don't think we're
looking for a knife.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.239
The edges of the
wound are too jagged.

01:49.240 --> 01:51.141
The neck was
somehow ripped open.

01:51.142 --> 01:53.743
Skirt's torn and no underwear.

01:53.744 --> 01:55.545
Possible sexual assault.

01:55.546 --> 01:57.547
I'm afraid that's likely.

01:57.548 --> 01:59.249
Bartender says our victim

01:59.250 --> 02:00.850
made quite a
splash here last night.

02:00.851 --> 02:02.792
Apparently, she
walked around the bar

02:02.793 --> 02:04.894
kissing one random
guy after another.

02:04.895 --> 02:06.696
(Peter) Well, maybe someone
wanted more than just a kiss

02:06.697 --> 02:08.127
and followed her out.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.129
Which means there was a bar
full of suspects here last night

02:10.130 --> 02:12.131
who are now long gone.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.164
We have their faces.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.307
(Megan) Yeah, but was the killer

02:17.308 --> 02:20.240
in front of the
camera or behind it?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.411
Tox screen was negative.

02:21.412 --> 02:22.572
(Camera shutter clicking)

02:22.573 --> 02:24.574
But her blood alcohol was .1.

02:24.575 --> 02:27.417
No apparent signs
of sexual assault.

02:27.418 --> 02:28.748
Huh.

02:28.749 --> 02:31.751
In fact, no signs of
sexual activity ever.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.823
Sounds like Niki
wasn't the wild child

02:33.824 --> 02:35.255
we saw in the photographs.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.586
You know, I'm amazed...
(Camera shutter clicking)

02:36.587 --> 02:38.288
Anybody gets out
of college alive.

02:38.289 --> 02:41.491
I mean, I know I had some times

02:41.492 --> 02:43.733
that I am legally
forbidden to speak of.

02:43.734 --> 02:45.765
Did things get crazy
in the game room?

02:45.766 --> 02:48.198
(Laughs)

02:48.199 --> 02:49.570
Yeah.

02:51.302 --> 02:52.472
Okay. (Sighs)

02:52.473 --> 02:53.803
(Clicking)

02:53.804 --> 02:56.346
Someone has drawn
circles on her abdomen...

02:56.347 --> 02:57.677
And hips,

02:57.678 --> 02:58.848
both sides.

02:58.849 --> 03:00.210
(Click)

03:00.211 --> 03:02.181
(Sighs)

03:02.182 --> 03:04.754
A chunk of hair
has been cut away,

03:04.755 --> 03:06.756
and there is trace

03:06.757 --> 03:08.758
on the remaining shafts... red.

03:08.759 --> 03:09.889
(Peter) What? Is it blood?

03:09.890 --> 03:11.661
No. It's powder.

03:11.662 --> 03:14.495
Could be transfer from
the murder weapon.

03:15.826 --> 03:18.368
Oh, and we've got a white paste

03:18.369 --> 03:19.529
right below the hairline.

03:19.530 --> 03:22.232
Yep. (Clears throat)

03:22.233 --> 03:24.834
You know, these markings,

03:24.835 --> 03:27.437
they might be ritualistic,

03:27.438 --> 03:28.838
like wiccan or satanic.

03:28.839 --> 03:30.280
(Kate) Or Greek.

03:30.281 --> 03:32.682
I think your college student
here was pledging a sorority.

03:32.683 --> 03:33.943
What makes you say that?

03:33.944 --> 03:36.386
Those blue circles
are a hazing ritual

03:36.387 --> 03:37.587
where the pledges
have to strip naked

03:37.588 --> 03:40.790
so the members can
Mark fat spots with a pen.

03:40.791 --> 03:42.892
Oh. People wonder why
we have eating disorders.

03:42.893 --> 03:45.925
I'll call bud and tell him to
get over to hoyt university.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.257
You know what? I'll go with him.

03:47.258 --> 03:48.528
He's gonna need a translator.

03:48.529 --> 03:51.401
I was zeta theta kappa.

03:51.402 --> 03:53.403
Of course you were.

03:53.404 --> 03:54.934
So, Jazmin, could
you check these over?

03:54.935 --> 03:56.936
We found them on Niki's phone.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.309
(Sighs) Yeah. I took these.

03:59.310 --> 04:01.371
(Lmfao) ♪ I'm sexy and I
know it ♪ (Camera shutter clicks)

04:01.372 --> 04:02.512
(Jazmin) Niki was
on a kissing spree.

04:02.513 --> 04:03.973
What?

04:03.974 --> 04:05.315
You have to kiss as many
boys as you can inside an hour.

04:05.316 --> 04:06.476
It's hazing.

04:06.477 --> 04:08.017
Uh, it's tradition.

04:08.018 --> 04:10.480
It bonds us to the
sisterhood for life.

04:10.481 --> 04:11.751
(Scoffs) You use all the lingo,

04:11.752 --> 04:13.283
but you completely
miss the point.

04:13.284 --> 04:15.285
My sorority sisters never put
each others' lives in danger.

04:15.286 --> 04:16.656
We actually looked
out for each other.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.828
Um, were there any
other, uh, traditions

04:18.829 --> 04:20.430
that Niki endured?

04:20.431 --> 04:22.261
Uh, she had to go
commando for a week.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.262
No underwear.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.435
Yeah, I got that one.

04:25.436 --> 04:28.838
Was Niki forced to cut
off a clump of her hair, too?

04:28.839 --> 04:30.700
What? No.

04:30.701 --> 04:31.971
Look, I liked Niki.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.743
I was trying to help her
come out of her shell.

04:33.744 --> 04:35.705
She had a rough life.

04:35.706 --> 04:37.407
She lost both of her parents.

04:37.408 --> 04:39.579
She was shy, looking
for a place to belong,

04:39.580 --> 04:41.280
a family.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.413
Family? You left her in a bar.

04:43.414 --> 04:45.515
Because she asked me
to. She wanted to hook up.

04:45.516 --> 04:47.286
Yeah, well, she died
in an alley instead.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.518
Jazmin,

04:48.519 --> 04:50.560
pictures?

04:50.561 --> 04:51.861
(People speaking indistinctly)

04:51.862 --> 04:54.324
I don't know any of these guys.

04:54.325 --> 04:55.325
Wait.

04:55.326 --> 04:56.966
I didn't take this last one.

04:56.967 --> 04:59.068
Niki took this
herself after I left.

04:59.069 --> 05:00.470
I know that guy.

05:00.471 --> 05:01.901
Who is he?

05:01.902 --> 05:03.302
Jack Gordon.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.434
He was in Niki's biology class.

05:04.435 --> 05:06.075
He was obsessed with her.

05:06.076 --> 05:07.837
Total stalker material.

05:07.838 --> 05:10.381
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

05:12.383 --> 05:14.444
Want to die.

05:14.445 --> 05:15.985
Okay.

05:15.986 --> 05:17.316
So you refill the reservoir

05:17.317 --> 05:18.418
from the Insulin vial...

05:18.419 --> 05:19.589
Program the pump,

05:19.590 --> 05:21.621
and change the batteries
every two weeks. I know.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.322
Okay. Now I know that you know.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.654
(Exhales deeply)

05:24.655 --> 05:26.456
It's too much, mom.

05:26.457 --> 05:28.458
I mean, keeping a food diary

05:28.459 --> 05:30.760
and carb counting
and Insulin levels...

05:30.761 --> 05:32.362
And now I have to check
in with you every few hours?

05:32.363 --> 05:33.533
Yes. What if you're all alone,

05:33.534 --> 05:34.864
you go into diabetic
shock again?

05:34.865 --> 05:36.335
I need to know where
you are at all times.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.837
You said I'd be able to do

05:37.838 --> 05:39.369
all the things I've always done.

05:39.370 --> 05:40.640
You can, you can,

05:40.641 --> 05:42.341
but it's just gonna be
a period of adjustment.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.013
It's not gonna happen
overnight, okay?

05:44.014 --> 05:45.745
(Lowered voice) I can't
wait till Aidan gets back

05:45.746 --> 05:47.477
so you can leave me alone.

05:47.478 --> 05:49.380
I heard that.

05:52.553 --> 05:55.725
We found 31 photos
of Niki kissing 31 guys,

05:55.726 --> 05:57.627
and you know
what I find curious?

05:57.628 --> 05:59.429
Yours was the very last photo.

05:59.430 --> 06:00.790
The very last
person to kiss her,

06:00.791 --> 06:02.392
probably the last
person to see her alive.

06:02.393 --> 06:03.633
Niki's dead?

06:03.634 --> 06:05.094
Murdered, actually.

06:05.095 --> 06:08.638
Did you wait for Jazmin to
leave so you could get Niki alone?

06:08.639 --> 06:10.640
N-N-No. Niki kissed me and left.

06:10.641 --> 06:12.542
Did she go out the back,
'cause we found her in the alley?

06:12.543 --> 06:15.074
You cornered her, didn't you?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.046
Things got out of hand.
(Kate) Makes sense.

06:17.047 --> 06:18.648
Jazmin said you were
obsessed with Niki.

06:18.649 --> 06:21.150
Said you'd followed her
around like a little lost puppy.

06:21.151 --> 06:23.112
Jazmin is a stuck-up bitch.

06:23.113 --> 06:25.084
Wow. That's quite a temper.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.086
Jack, you knew Niki was gonna be

06:27.087 --> 06:28.918
at that bar last
night, didn't you?

06:28.919 --> 06:31.390
I overheard her telling friends.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.663
And you wanted to kiss her.

06:33.664 --> 06:35.164
Yeah, I mean...

06:35.165 --> 06:36.996
It... it was, like,
my only chance.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.668
She... she wouldn't
do it otherwise.

06:38.669 --> 06:40.570
Not with someone like me anyway.

06:40.571 --> 06:43.604
I'm not buying
the martyr act kid.

06:44.735 --> 06:46.436
Stay local.

06:46.437 --> 06:48.708
I got a feeling we're gonna
see each other again real soon.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.712
(Indistinct conversations)

06:54.515 --> 06:55.645
Help me out, bud.
(Camera shutter clicking)

06:55.646 --> 06:57.487
I mean, the baby shower's
only a few days away.

06:57.488 --> 06:58.988
How am I supposed
to get the perfect gift

06:58.989 --> 07:00.550
if I don't know the
sex of the baby?

07:00.551 --> 07:03.422
What's the big mystery? Jeannie
had horrible morning sickness.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.024
She's having a boy.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.826
Actually, my gut
tells me it's a girl.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.758
You're never gonna break me.

07:08.759 --> 07:10.059
We ready to get started?

07:10.060 --> 07:11.430
Uh, yeah.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.203
First you need
to check this out.

07:14.204 --> 07:17.737
Frontal and ethmoid nasal
bones are completely shattered.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.438
Maybe the suspect punched her.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.541
Well, if that were the
case, we'd usually see

07:21.542 --> 07:22.912
a cleaner fracture pattern.

07:22.913 --> 07:24.474
I mean, this looks like somebody

07:24.475 --> 07:25.775
stuck a screwdriver up her nose

07:25.776 --> 07:27.477
and started
spinning it in circles.

07:27.478 --> 07:29.218
Ethan.

07:29.219 --> 07:30.620
Yeah?

07:30.621 --> 07:33.222
I think I'm gonna
need the stryker saw.

07:33.223 --> 07:34.854
Oh, no. I know that look.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.857
You want to tell us what's
going on in that brain of yours?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.630
It's not my brain
I'm worried about.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.533
(Peter) Goggles.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.537
Thank you.

07:47.538 --> 07:50.541
(Tearing)

07:53.774 --> 07:56.046
(Tearing)

07:57.708 --> 07:59.049
Shield.

08:01.011 --> 08:02.713
Saw.

08:04.515 --> 08:07.588
(Whirring)

08:15.666 --> 08:17.668
(Whirring stops)

08:20.170 --> 08:23.674
(Cracking)

08:33.143 --> 08:34.744
Oh, my god.

08:34.745 --> 08:37.517
That is just what
I was afraid of.

08:38.719 --> 08:42.692
Someone has removed her brain.

08:42.693 --> 08:46.597
(Fabric snaps)

08:50.661 --> 08:51.831
You knew what
you were gonna find

08:51.832 --> 08:52.803
before you cut into the skull.

08:52.804 --> 08:54.664
I suspected it.

08:54.665 --> 08:56.866
How? I mean, who
suspects a missing brain?

08:56.867 --> 08:59.709
Because I've seen it
before, three years ago.

08:59.710 --> 09:02.041
It was my very first case when
I was a fellow in fox county.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.744
The victim's name
was Jennifer Marshall.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.045
She was the third woman found

09:06.046 --> 09:08.948
with throat slashed,
nose battered,

09:08.949 --> 09:10.219
brain removed.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.581
Your first case
was a serial killer?

09:11.582 --> 09:12.952
That's a tough break.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.083
Yes, I remember this.

09:14.084 --> 09:15.625
The... the guy was a-a
wealthy video game designer.

09:15.626 --> 09:17.757
Oh, that "pyramid invaders" guy.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.960
Wilson polley.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.261
Back in the good old days,

09:22.262 --> 09:24.764
during mummification,
the Egyptians,

09:24.765 --> 09:27.797
they would shove
an embalming hook

09:27.798 --> 09:29.098
up a corpse's nose,

09:29.099 --> 09:31.270
then punch right
through the nasal cavity,

09:31.271 --> 09:32.872
and churn the brain into a soup

09:32.873 --> 09:35.775
and pour it out
through the nostrils.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.206
He described his
entire methodology

09:37.207 --> 09:38.908
in a TV interview?

09:38.909 --> 09:41.580
One year before
the first murder.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.982
That is very ballsy.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.283
Wilson thought he was
too smart to get caught.

09:44.284 --> 09:45.985
Big mistake.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.818
All of his victims were
members of the p.T.A.

09:48.819 --> 09:50.790
At the high school that
Wilson's daughter attended.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.793
They were all women
that he had asked out.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.094
I remember hearing about
this. It was all over the news.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.226
Rejection was his trigger.

09:57.227 --> 10:00.630
Okay, so Wilson polley
is serving a life sentence.

10:00.631 --> 10:02.601
So who killed Niki shumaker?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.903
Copycat killer, obviously.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.705
With intimate
knowledge of the crimes.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.807
We don't normally release
these kind of details.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.938
No, we don't. But
you know who did?

10:08.939 --> 10:10.780
The original suspect
in the killings...

10:10.781 --> 10:11.941
Daniel grubstick.

10:11.942 --> 10:14.784
He wrote a tell-all
book clearing his name.

10:14.785 --> 10:16.916
Original suspect?

10:16.917 --> 10:18.919
Try new suspect.

10:22.693 --> 10:25.195
A copycat killer?
You're kidding.

10:26.857 --> 10:28.027
You're not kidding.

10:28.028 --> 10:29.328
Would you mind taking a look

10:29.329 --> 10:32.201
at some crime scene
photos of the new victim?

10:32.202 --> 10:33.733
Why'd you bring 'em to me?

10:33.734 --> 10:36.035
Well, you are the world's
self-proclaimed expert

10:36.036 --> 10:38.738
on all things Wilson polley.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.741
Maybe you'll see
something that we missed.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.744
Ah. Flattery will get you
everywhere with me, Dr. Hunt.

10:44.745 --> 10:47.046
But I think this is more
about due diligence.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.979
I was a suspect before
so I'm a suspect again.

10:49.980 --> 10:51.681
Right?

10:51.682 --> 10:53.753
Smart man.

10:53.754 --> 10:54.985
Yeah, I am.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.030
Oh, no.

11:01.031 --> 11:02.431
No, no, no.

11:02.432 --> 11:03.933
Not Niki?

11:03.934 --> 11:06.295
Wait. Uh, you knew
Niki shumaker?

11:06.296 --> 11:08.667
Of course. I was her high
school English teacher.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.771
But her real name
is Niki Marshall.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.203
Wait.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.746
Jennifer Marshall's daughter?

11:16.747 --> 11:18.948
That was Wilson's last victim.

11:18.949 --> 11:22.281
She must have changed her
name to get a fresh start in college.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.813
So this wasn't random.

11:23.814 --> 11:25.915
The killer knew
exactly who she was.

11:25.916 --> 11:28.457
Niki was a good
kid. What a tragedy.

11:28.458 --> 11:31.020
Tragedy has been good to you.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.122
Good to me?

11:33.123 --> 11:34.423
My life was turned upside down

11:34.424 --> 11:36.395
because I happen to
be in Jennifer's house

11:36.396 --> 11:39.068
three hours before
Wilson murdered her.

11:39.069 --> 11:40.770
Um, I didn't read your book.

11:40.771 --> 11:42.772
Why exactly were you there?

11:42.773 --> 11:44.874
Niki left her backpack
in the classroom.

11:44.875 --> 11:46.175
I dropped it off.

11:46.176 --> 11:48.177
You did that a lot,

11:48.178 --> 11:51.111
make house calls for
your female students?

11:57.447 --> 11:59.048
Hey, lace. Where's your mom?

11:59.049 --> 12:01.020
Off thinking up new ways
to torture me, I'm sure.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.051
Oh, come on. It
can't be that bad.

12:02.052 --> 12:03.222
It's worse.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.754
Ever since I was
diagnosed with diabetes,

12:04.755 --> 12:07.126
she's become, like,
the enemy of fun.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.328
Lacey, your mom's just
worried about you. It's her job.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.861
It's okay. I've accepted it.

12:11.862 --> 12:14.033
I'm never going
to have fun again.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.005
(People speaking indistinctly)

12:16.006 --> 12:18.267
Between you and me, if
I've learned one thing lately,

12:18.268 --> 12:21.040
it's that life is too
short to play it safe.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.042
Live fast, die young?

12:23.043 --> 12:25.044
No. Live smart, die old.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.876
You control the diabetes.

12:26.877 --> 12:28.747
Don't let the
diabetes control you.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.881
You're the most mature
13 year old I know, Lacey.

12:31.882 --> 12:33.452
You can handle it.

12:33.453 --> 12:37.156
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

12:37.157 --> 12:38.128
(Ethan) So the lab

12:38.129 --> 12:39.458
identified the white substance

12:39.459 --> 12:41.190
on Niki shumaker's forehead.

12:41.191 --> 12:43.192
It's doxepin skin cream.

12:43.193 --> 12:45.795
Doxepin? She didn't have
a chronic skin condition.

12:45.796 --> 12:47.797
No, but maybe the killer does.

12:47.798 --> 12:50.169
Oh, can I ask you a
personal question?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.942
What do you think bud's
having, a boy or a girl?

12:52.943 --> 12:54.243
How am I supposed to know?

12:54.244 --> 12:55.774
Seriously?

12:55.775 --> 12:58.147
You don't have some
super-secret scientific insight?

12:58.148 --> 13:01.510
Okay, there is a way
to tell just by looking.

13:01.511 --> 13:02.812
Please tell me.

13:02.813 --> 13:04.153
(Whispers) Ultrasound.

13:04.154 --> 13:05.115
(Curtis laughs)

13:05.116 --> 13:06.455
Oh, my god. What a nerd.

13:06.456 --> 13:07.987
(Laughs) Thank you for that.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.558
Are you all still talking
about that baby shower?

13:09.559 --> 13:12.061
Haven't you ever heard
of a gender-neutral gift?

13:12.062 --> 13:14.393
Yes, I have. It just... It
leaves me uninspired.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.866
Well, this ought
to inspire your ass.

13:16.867 --> 13:19.298
That red trace you
found on Niki's hair shaft,

13:19.299 --> 13:20.830
it's conga red.

13:20.831 --> 13:22.471
What is a biochemical marker

13:22.472 --> 13:25.474
doing in a sorority girl's hair?

13:25.475 --> 13:27.076
Not sure yet, but
it got me thinking.

13:27.077 --> 13:29.508
What if Wilson's
copy cat took a trophy,

13:29.509 --> 13:32.081
something Wilson never did.

13:32.082 --> 13:33.943
But why perfectly
recreate Wilson's crime

13:33.944 --> 13:36.415
only to use a distinct
signature to set yourself apart?

13:36.416 --> 13:38.547
To impress Wilson.

13:38.548 --> 13:40.089
Mm-hmm.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.491
So I went online,
found this site...

13:42.492 --> 13:44.023
"Wilson's posse."

13:44.024 --> 13:46.055
It's where Wilson
groupies go to play.

13:46.056 --> 13:47.957
And since fans
write fan letters,

13:47.958 --> 13:51.331
why don't we find out who's
been writing Wilson polley?

13:53.163 --> 13:54.864
(Buzzer sounds)

13:54.865 --> 13:56.505
(Megan) I gotta say,

13:56.506 --> 13:59.038
orange is definitely your color.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.211
Now what brings you
here? What do you want?

14:02.212 --> 14:04.073
Jennifer Marshall.

14:04.074 --> 14:07.146
Her daughter was
killed two nights ago.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.878
Who, n...

14:08.879 --> 14:10.049
Niki?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.250
Throat slashed,

14:11.251 --> 14:12.581
brain removed.

14:12.582 --> 14:14.183
Sound familiar?

14:14.184 --> 14:16.225
The real killer is back.

14:16.226 --> 14:17.586
Not a moment too soon.

14:17.587 --> 14:20.129
I've grown tired of
doing time for his crimes.

14:20.130 --> 14:21.290
(Laughs)

14:21.291 --> 14:23.062
You're really not gonna
sing that same old song again,

14:23.063 --> 14:24.233
are you?

14:24.234 --> 14:26.335
You came here to see me,

14:26.336 --> 14:29.638
not the other way around.

14:29.639 --> 14:31.640
What about Wilson's posse?

14:31.641 --> 14:34.203
You don't think one
of your many admirers

14:34.204 --> 14:35.644
killed Niki to impress you,

14:35.645 --> 14:37.546
their big hero?

14:37.547 --> 14:39.308
I despise that little cult.

14:39.309 --> 14:40.980
It's despicable.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.511
You see, their admiration

14:42.512 --> 14:46.155
is predicated on the
assumption that I'm guilty.

14:46.156 --> 14:48.217
They think it's so cool
to idolize a monster,

14:48.218 --> 14:50.189
and thanks to you,

14:50.190 --> 14:52.321
that's exactly how
they see me now.

14:52.322 --> 14:55.564
Then, Wilson, we
want the same thing.

14:55.565 --> 14:58.197
If you are innocent,

14:58.198 --> 15:01.230
helping me find the real
killer will only help you.

15:01.231 --> 15:04.273
Even if it proves you wrong?

15:04.274 --> 15:05.304
Sure.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.176
I follow the evidence
wherever it leads.

15:07.177 --> 15:08.637
But...

15:08.638 --> 15:11.640
Sometimes evidence lies.

15:11.641 --> 15:14.483
Your d.N.A. Was on Jennifer...

15:14.484 --> 15:15.645
Fact.

15:19.349 --> 15:22.491
I licked her ear.

15:22.492 --> 15:24.954
Doesn't mean that I killed her.

15:24.955 --> 15:26.956
(Laughs) We both know you did.

15:26.957 --> 15:28.157
Do we?

15:28.158 --> 15:30.029
(People speaking indistinctly)

15:30.030 --> 15:33.432
Now this is what your mistake

15:33.433 --> 15:36.506
has cost me.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.309
That's your daughter Sophia.

15:40.310 --> 15:42.711
Can you imagine what all this

15:42.712 --> 15:44.473
has put her through?

15:44.474 --> 15:46.615
You see, I don't have a
problem with the world

15:46.616 --> 15:50.349
believing I'm evil incarnate.

15:50.350 --> 15:52.681
But not my little daughter.

15:52.682 --> 15:54.623
Are you gonna help me or not?

15:54.624 --> 15:55.954
Ah...

15:55.955 --> 15:58.157
Gotta think about it.

15:58.158 --> 16:01.030
Think fast.

16:01.031 --> 16:04.034
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

16:07.237 --> 16:09.299
From my fans.

16:11.271 --> 16:14.303
No. You have to
promise me one thing first.

16:14.304 --> 16:16.375
When you realize I'm innocent,

16:16.376 --> 16:21.081
I want an apology for the
years you stole from my life.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.362
Here's the thing about
apologies, Wilson...

16:34.394 --> 16:38.468
They don't come naturally to me.

16:49.279 --> 16:50.339
"Wilson,

16:50.340 --> 16:51.640
"you are my inspiration.

16:51.641 --> 16:54.513
"You never explain yourself
to the masses of sheep

16:54.514 --> 16:56.085
"that inhabit this world,

16:56.086 --> 16:59.448
but the more they judge
you, the freer you become."

16:59.449 --> 17:00.619
I didn't write that.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.591
Are you sure?

17:01.592 --> 17:04.593
Because it's signed
"Gordon Jackson,"

17:04.594 --> 17:07.126
and you're... Jack Gordon.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.697
It's quite clever.

17:08.698 --> 17:12.201
We could do a
handwriting comparison.

17:12.202 --> 17:15.404
Okay. Maybe I... Did write it.

17:15.405 --> 17:18.337
Well, thanks for
owning up, uh, Jack.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.370
Uh, so a serial killer
is your inspiration.

17:21.371 --> 17:23.112
How far do you take that?

17:23.113 --> 17:26.075
Enough to kill Niki
and rip out her brain

17:26.076 --> 17:28.317
to show Wilson how much
you're worthy of his attention?

17:28.318 --> 17:30.449
No, no, I-I would
never hurt Niki.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.620
Level with me, Jack.

17:31.621 --> 17:33.152
When did you figure out

17:33.153 --> 17:35.254
that Niki was Jennifer
Marshall's daughter?

17:35.255 --> 17:36.725
I recognized her on the quad

17:36.726 --> 17:39.428
from pictures in "mind games."

17:39.429 --> 17:41.630
We became friends.

17:41.631 --> 17:42.761
Oh, you made sure of that.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.393
Did you tell her you knew
exactly who she was?

17:44.394 --> 17:46.595
Friends are honest
with each other, right?

17:46.596 --> 17:48.667
All I ever tried to
do was protect her.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.640
Do you know how many
crazies there are in the world?

17:51.641 --> 17:53.842
Uh, yeah, I-I think I do.

17:53.843 --> 17:57.246
You're an organic
chemistry major, are you?

17:57.247 --> 17:59.248
(Inhales deeply) Yeah.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.650
Why were you working with...

18:01.651 --> 18:04.653
Conga red?

18:04.654 --> 18:06.615
I was making
conga red indicators

18:06.616 --> 18:08.787
and testing them
against acids and lye.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.359
So what?

18:10.360 --> 18:12.361
Because the killer cut
off a clump of Niki's hair.

18:12.362 --> 18:15.264
The remaining shafts
had transfer on them...

18:15.265 --> 18:16.625
Conga red.

18:16.626 --> 18:19.729
You took a trophy.

18:23.533 --> 18:26.606
Yes.

18:31.381 --> 18:34.543
(Inhales deeply)

18:34.544 --> 18:36.345
Ohh.

18:36.346 --> 18:39.848
Niki always smelled so sweet.

18:39.849 --> 18:42.120
I knew I'd never be
that close to her again,

18:42.121 --> 18:44.753
so... I-I cut off
some of her hair

18:44.754 --> 18:46.525
when she kissed me.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.696
Mm.

18:47.697 --> 18:50.230
Just to remember
her by, you know?

18:51.731 --> 18:55.304
But I swear, I never hurt her.

18:55.305 --> 18:57.606
Okay, freak show.
You're under arrest.

18:57.607 --> 18:58.837
(Grunts)

18:58.838 --> 19:01.810
(Singsongy) Come on. Let's go.

19:01.811 --> 19:03.172
(Footsteps approach)

19:03.173 --> 19:04.513
(Peter) Hey.

19:04.514 --> 19:05.644
Hey.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.177
Is that for the Niki
shumaker case?

19:08.178 --> 19:09.518
Yeah. I'm casting the tool marks

19:09.519 --> 19:10.779
inside her calvarium

19:10.780 --> 19:11.820
to compare 'em to
the original victims'.

19:11.821 --> 19:13.352
Fox county is
sending over the casts.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.623
I've already got 'em.

19:14.624 --> 19:15.724
I was gonna do this,

19:15.725 --> 19:17.226
but you kinda beat
me to the punch.

19:17.227 --> 19:19.358
Yeah, I just felt
like I should do it.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.560
You know, as a
sorority girl, too.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.662
So...

19:23.663 --> 19:25.664
Uh, these all have

19:25.665 --> 19:28.797
the same unique
groove imperfections,

19:28.798 --> 19:30.669
uh, from the tip of the hook

19:30.670 --> 19:31.770
and all linked to
the same killer...

19:31.771 --> 19:33.242
Wilson.

19:33.243 --> 19:35.505
Let's compare 'em to Niki's.

19:45.415 --> 19:47.716
Perfect match.

19:47.717 --> 19:49.418
You know what this means, right?

19:49.419 --> 19:50.719
(Scoffs)

19:50.720 --> 19:53.963
Yeah. Megan is
not gonna be happy.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.368
I didn't make a mistake.

19:59.369 --> 20:00.669
All four victims had
their brains extracted

20:00.670 --> 20:01.830
with the same hook.

20:01.831 --> 20:03.602
That suggests a single killer.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.774
Since Wilson was in prison
when Niki shumaker was murdered,

20:05.775 --> 20:07.336
he probably didn't kill

20:07.337 --> 20:08.677
the original three
victims either.

20:08.678 --> 20:09.838
You cannot be serious.

20:09.839 --> 20:11.340
I think we need to
consider the possibility

20:11.341 --> 20:12.741
that Wilson is innocent.

20:12.742 --> 20:15.213
What about the d.N.A. That
I found on Jennifer Marshall?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.915
It doesn't prove
murder. All right?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.517
He was never even tied
to the first two victims.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.818
He knew every one of
them through the p.T.A.

20:19.819 --> 20:20.989
So did Daniel grubstick.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.791
He was a teacher
at the same high...

20:22.792 --> 20:23.753
Look, Megan,

20:23.754 --> 20:25.454
I get it, okay?

20:25.455 --> 20:26.695
I do. It was your first case.

20:26.696 --> 20:28.397
You were eager
to prove yourself.

20:28.398 --> 20:29.758
Oh, my g... mistakes happen.

20:29.759 --> 20:31.661
Not to me.

20:32.962 --> 20:34.563
Wow. Y...

20:34.564 --> 20:36.004
(chuckles) You know what?

20:36.005 --> 20:38.767
I am really sorry, but a
falsely imprisoned man

20:38.768 --> 20:41.570
takes precedence
over your ego, okay?

20:41.571 --> 20:42.871
Wait. No. We're done.

20:42.872 --> 20:44.573
No, wait a minute.

20:44.574 --> 20:46.745
(Chuckles) I know exactly
what Wilson is doing,

20:46.746 --> 20:51.680
and it's brilliant, and you
are playing right into it.

20:51.681 --> 20:53.852
You convinced Jack Gordon
to kill Niki on your behalf.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.384
I helped you, Dr. Hunt,

20:55.385 --> 20:57.726
and this is the way you
show me your gratitude?

20:57.727 --> 20:58.857
You told him where
to find your brain hook.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.559
Oh, can you even
conceive of a world

21:00.560 --> 21:01.830
where you might be wrong?

21:01.831 --> 21:03.692
And you knew that if
he used it to kill Niki,

21:03.693 --> 21:05.694
it would look like one
person killed all four women,

21:05.695 --> 21:08.297
and then you would get
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

21:08.298 --> 21:09.738
What's the matter, Dr. Hunt?

21:09.739 --> 21:10.939
Is the evidence
proving I'm innocent?

21:10.940 --> 21:13.342
Don't pack your bags just yet.

21:13.343 --> 21:15.844
Oh, your bravado
seems a little bit forced.

21:15.845 --> 21:17.546
But I know why.

21:17.547 --> 21:20.549
Because you're all alone
on this at work, aren't you?

21:20.550 --> 21:22.651
Oh, it's gotta
be so frustrating.

21:22.652 --> 21:25.314
They underestimate you. I don't.

21:25.315 --> 21:28.317
Well, then I believe
this conversation is over.

21:28.318 --> 21:31.920
I'll just sit here and wait
for the truth to set me free.

21:31.921 --> 21:32.991
Fine.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.693
Nothing you can say
will ever change the fact

21:34.694 --> 21:36.895
that I know you're a killer.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.027
You know what
the great irony is?

21:39.028 --> 21:41.029
The only one of us

21:41.030 --> 21:44.433
who's taken a life is you.

21:44.434 --> 21:46.535
You killed a patient.

21:46.536 --> 21:48.607
Have you forgotten?

21:48.608 --> 21:51.780
You knowingly
performed neurosurgery

21:51.781 --> 21:54.883
with paresthesia.

21:54.884 --> 21:57.846
I mean, come on, a
surgeon with shaky hands.

21:57.847 --> 21:59.748
But you went ahead anyway.

21:59.749 --> 22:01.350
I know why.

22:01.351 --> 22:04.493
Because you didn't
care. You're so arrogant.

22:04.494 --> 22:06.695
Your arrogance has driven away

22:06.696 --> 22:08.927
every person you
love in your life.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.430
You see, that's why your
husband divorced you

22:11.431 --> 22:14.633
and shut you out from
your daughter's life.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.865
Who knows? Maybe that's
why your daddy shot himself.

22:16.866 --> 22:19.067
That was probably easier
for him than to spend

22:19.068 --> 22:21.040
another waking
moment... Shut up! Shut up!

22:26.916 --> 22:28.777
Yeah?

22:28.778 --> 22:30.849
What about your victims, Wilson?

22:30.850 --> 22:33.722
All those women dead

22:33.723 --> 22:35.854
because they dared to prick

22:35.855 --> 22:37.956
your fragile little male ego.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.759
What was it that Jennifer's
sister testified on the stand?

22:40.760 --> 22:41.990
Remind me.

22:41.991 --> 22:43.992
No, wait. I remember.

22:43.993 --> 22:46.965
You're a big bore in bed.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.097
And when Jennifer told you that,

22:49.098 --> 22:50.699
you lost it, didn't you?

22:50.700 --> 22:53.101
Is that why you killed
all those women,

22:53.102 --> 22:56.074
because they knew
you're not a real man?

22:56.075 --> 22:59.979
Best be on your way, Dr. Hunt.

23:02.111 --> 23:04.082
(Cell phone rings)

23:04.083 --> 23:07.886
(Ring)

23:07.887 --> 23:09.958
Yeah.

23:09.959 --> 23:11.960
I cross-referenced the evidence
we found on Niki shumaker's body

23:11.961 --> 23:13.562
with suspects from
the original case.

23:13.563 --> 23:15.564
And?

23:15.565 --> 23:16.865
Remember the doxepin cream
we found on Niki's forehead?

23:16.866 --> 23:18.497
It turns out that
Daniel grubstick

23:18.498 --> 23:20.499
has a prescription for it,

23:20.500 --> 23:22.220
and we've got a warrant
to search his house.

23:40.490 --> 23:41.950
What did you find?

23:41.951 --> 23:43.452
An Egyptian embalming hook.

23:43.453 --> 23:45.024
It looks like the real thing.

23:53.563 --> 23:55.033
(Sam) You want to explain
why you were in possession

23:55.034 --> 23:58.106
of the weapon used to
remove the brains of four girls?

23:58.107 --> 24:00.669
Three mornings ago, I
found a box on my porch.

24:00.670 --> 24:01.810
I found the hook inside.

24:01.811 --> 24:04.773
Hmm. Same day
Niki shumaker died.

24:04.774 --> 24:06.675
Which I didn't know at the time.

24:06.676 --> 24:08.747
You know, I'm gonna
let you keep talking,

24:08.748 --> 24:11.520
'cause I can't wait to
hear what you say next.

24:11.521 --> 24:12.921
Look...

24:12.922 --> 24:15.754
I wrote the definitive book

24:15.755 --> 24:17.055
on the Wilson polley murders.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.057
Crazy fans are always
sending me crap

24:19.058 --> 24:20.789
they claim is new evidence.

24:20.790 --> 24:23.061
I'm gonna have to stop you
there to ask one question.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.763
Why didn't you tell
me about the hook

24:24.764 --> 24:26.064
the first time we spoke?!

24:26.065 --> 24:27.696
I wanted to
authenticate it first

24:27.697 --> 24:29.668
so I wouldn't waste your time.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.640
But the lab matched
the hook to all four girls,

24:31.641 --> 24:32.671
so consider it authenticated

24:32.672 --> 24:34.743
and your ass in serious peril.

24:34.744 --> 24:36.174
It's a clever plan,
Mr. Grubstick.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.846
You kill three girls,

24:37.847 --> 24:40.108
frame Wilson, write
a book, and get rich.

24:40.109 --> 24:42.751
Even if that were
true, and it's not,

24:42.752 --> 24:44.783
why would I kill Niki now?

24:44.784 --> 24:46.685
Because your 15
minutes of fame were up.

24:46.686 --> 24:48.817
Another dead girl
buys you 15 more.

24:48.818 --> 24:50.118
Why do you use doxepin cream,

24:50.119 --> 24:52.561
Mr. Grubstick?

24:52.562 --> 24:54.693
I...

24:54.694 --> 24:56.165
I have eczema.

24:57.827 --> 24:59.528
He has eczema.

24:59.529 --> 25:01.870
Really? Niki didn't.

25:01.871 --> 25:04.803
But we still found
doxepin on her forehead.

25:04.804 --> 25:06.104
That and the murder weapon

25:06.105 --> 25:09.638
puts you on the
hook for four murders.

25:09.639 --> 25:11.710
I'm sorry. Just... i
couldn't resist that one.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.182
(Chuckles)

25:16.215 --> 25:18.847
(Sighs)

25:18.848 --> 25:20.849
I don't want to talk about it.

25:20.850 --> 25:22.190
Well, that is just too bad,

25:22.191 --> 25:23.993
because I'm not
leaving until we do.

25:25.294 --> 25:27.155
So you may have put
an innocent man in jail.

25:27.156 --> 25:29.558
That could have
happened to any of us.

25:29.559 --> 25:31.900
What if my ego blinded me?

25:31.901 --> 25:33.562
Is that what Wilson told you?

25:33.563 --> 25:35.804
Don't let that guy rent a
room in your head, okay?

25:35.805 --> 25:37.105
Kate said it, too.

25:37.106 --> 25:38.767
(People speaking indistinctly)

25:38.768 --> 25:41.770
Do you have an ego? Absolutely.

25:41.771 --> 25:43.271
But you always do your job,

25:43.272 --> 25:45.273
and the evidence that you
found against Wilson is very real.

25:45.274 --> 25:46.845
It's just...

25:46.846 --> 25:48.276
It's just the interpretation
that's in question.

25:48.277 --> 25:49.749
Do you think I was wrong?

25:52.051 --> 25:53.822
Megan, we don't have time

25:53.823 --> 25:55.784
for you to feel
sorry for yourself.

25:55.785 --> 25:57.986
(Chuckles)

25:57.987 --> 26:00.258
Okay, that was blunt. (Chuckles)

26:00.259 --> 26:03.632
Where do you think
I learned that from?

26:03.633 --> 26:06.995
Forensics lifted a
partial print off the hook.

26:06.996 --> 26:08.697
We just got a hit.

26:08.698 --> 26:09.798
Daniel grubstick?

26:09.799 --> 26:10.899
Nope.

26:10.900 --> 26:13.972
Sophia polley,
Wilson's daughter.

26:13.973 --> 26:17.345
So the real killer
strikes again,

26:17.346 --> 26:18.847
and you don't admit
you were wrong

26:18.848 --> 26:20.208
and release my dad?

26:20.209 --> 26:22.210
Hey, Sophia, we're
on the same page.

26:22.211 --> 26:23.952
Wilson is innocent.

26:23.953 --> 26:26.084
We were wrong. I'm sorry.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.616
Don't mess with me.

26:27.617 --> 26:28.857
I'm not.

26:28.858 --> 26:30.959
All four women were
murdered by the same killer.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.692
And since Wilson was
in prison when Niki died,

26:33.693 --> 26:34.793
he's no longer a suspect.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.795
So now he's just a genius

26:36.796 --> 26:38.326
who works in a
prison laundry room

26:38.327 --> 26:39.828
because you guys screwed up.

26:39.829 --> 26:41.169
Well, that won't be for long.

26:41.170 --> 26:43.802
The new evidence
will exonerate him.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.303
What new evidence?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.706
The murder weapon.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.839
The one with your prints on it.

26:53.883 --> 26:56.014
(Scoffs)

26:56.015 --> 26:58.116
I can explain that.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.249
I think you'd better.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.251
Daniel grubstick

27:03.252 --> 27:05.153
showed up at my
house three nights ago,

27:05.154 --> 27:06.855
out of the blue.

27:06.856 --> 27:08.196
Said he was writing a new book

27:08.197 --> 27:09.928
to help prove my
dad's innocence.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.960
But he thinks that
Wilson is guilty.

27:11.961 --> 27:12.932
Yeah.

27:12.933 --> 27:14.963
When he pulled out the
hook, I knew he was lying.

27:14.964 --> 27:17.936
He handed it to me
and asked if it was real.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.107
Was it?

27:19.108 --> 27:20.809
How would I know?

27:20.810 --> 27:22.871
(Sighs) Come on, Sophia.

27:22.872 --> 27:25.143
The hook was yours all along.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.075
You'd used it to
kill four women.

27:27.076 --> 27:30.418
I had no reason to hurt
those women. (Laughs)

27:30.419 --> 27:32.250
They... they were all mothers
of girls who went to my school.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.952
Niki and I were friends.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.653
You had every reason.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.026
Your father was so lonely
after your mother died,

27:38.027 --> 27:40.859
and these mothers
had just rejected him.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.691
I mean, how dare they.

27:42.692 --> 27:43.892
So you killed them,

27:43.893 --> 27:45.994
and Wilson took the
rap for his little girl.

27:45.995 --> 27:48.166
No, that's crazy. But your
life's gone down the drain

27:48.167 --> 27:49.667
since daddy went
away, hasn't it?

27:49.668 --> 27:50.839
So you killed
Niki... Please stop.

27:50.840 --> 27:52.000
To set him free

27:52.001 --> 27:53.441
and dropped the hook
on grubstick's porch

27:53.442 --> 27:54.943
to frame him,

27:54.944 --> 27:57.876
all the while, not knowing
that you'd left a print behind.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.048
I didn't kill anyone!

28:00.049 --> 28:02.180
(Telephone rings)

28:02.181 --> 28:04.012
Megan hunt.

28:04.013 --> 28:05.714
(Wilson) Hey, you stay the hell

28:05.715 --> 28:07.185
away from my
daughter. You hear that?

28:07.186 --> 28:09.187
Not when the evidence
leads me right to her.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.189
The only thing the
evidence has proven so far

28:11.190 --> 28:12.761
is my innocence.

28:12.762 --> 28:13.892
I'm hanging up now.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.924
Well, I wonder how
you'd feel if someone

28:15.925 --> 28:18.026
went after your
precious daughter...

28:18.027 --> 28:20.298
Lacey. Don't you
dare threaten me.

28:20.299 --> 28:21.830
Oh, no, no. Of course not.

28:21.831 --> 28:23.231
I just hope that none of

28:23.232 --> 28:25.734
my misguided followers
try to impress me for real.

28:25.735 --> 28:27.776
What a shame that would be.

28:27.777 --> 28:29.438
(Line disconnects,
dial tone drones)

28:36.045 --> 28:38.146
(Phone rings)

28:38.147 --> 28:40.048
(Lacey) Hi. I'm Lacey's phone.

28:40.049 --> 28:42.050
Be nice to me and I'll
give her your message.

28:42.051 --> 28:44.022
(Lock clicks)

28:44.023 --> 28:46.054
Lacey?

28:46.055 --> 28:48.027
Are you here?

28:51.030 --> 28:52.330
Oh, thank god.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.263
Lace.

29:09.018 --> 29:10.178
(Voice breaking)
Bud, listen to me.

29:10.179 --> 29:11.519
Something is wrong.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.121
I have called Lacey a hundred
times. She doesn't answer.

29:13.122 --> 29:14.883
I have called Todd. He
doesn't know where she is.

29:14.884 --> 29:16.054
What if Wilson...

29:16.055 --> 29:17.225
No, forget Wilson.

29:17.226 --> 29:18.526
Here's what we're gonna do...

29:18.527 --> 29:22.030
I'm gonna send a patrol
car out to you right now,

29:22.031 --> 29:23.291
and you are going to stay put.

29:23.292 --> 29:25.033
No, I need to go
out and find her.

29:25.034 --> 29:27.896
No, you need to stay put
in case Lacey comes home.

29:27.897 --> 29:29.167
(Lowered voice) Get
out there right now.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.468
(Sighs)

29:30.469 --> 29:32.170
I can't lose her, bud.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.042
You won't. Megan...

29:34.043 --> 29:35.373
She is going to show up.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.875
I promise.

29:36.876 --> 29:40.909
Now hang up and keep calling
her until you get through, okay?

29:40.910 --> 29:43.181
(Sniffles) Okay.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.414
(Exhales)

29:48.017 --> 29:50.288
(Cell phone rings)

29:50.289 --> 29:51.289
(Line clicks)

29:51.290 --> 29:53.391
Mom, don't freak.
Lacey, where are you?

29:53.392 --> 29:55.063
I'm at a party.

29:55.064 --> 29:56.524
Give me the address.

29:56.525 --> 29:58.166
I'm totally fine.

29:58.167 --> 29:59.398
Give it to me right now.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.906
(Brakes squeal)

30:07.907 --> 30:10.008
(Turns engine off)
I said I was sorry.

30:10.009 --> 30:13.311
Well, we're still
gonna go over it again.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.343
You defied me on purpose
by going to that party.

30:15.344 --> 30:17.045
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

30:17.046 --> 30:19.087
Yes, because you
wouldn't have let me go.

30:19.088 --> 30:20.418
You don't let me
do anything anymore

30:20.419 --> 30:21.990
because you're scared of
everyone and everything,

30:21.991 --> 30:23.551
and I'm tired of it!

30:23.552 --> 30:25.453
I can take care of myself.

30:25.454 --> 30:27.095
(Inhales deeply)

30:27.096 --> 30:29.327
Peter thinks I'm mature enough
to make my own decisions.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.328
Why don't you?

30:32.601 --> 30:34.302
Okay.

30:34.303 --> 30:36.104
You want me to
treat you like an adult?

30:36.105 --> 30:37.265
Yes.

30:37.266 --> 30:38.466
All right.

30:38.467 --> 30:40.468
A very dangerous man
who I helped put in jail

30:40.469 --> 30:43.071
made serious threats today.

30:43.072 --> 30:44.913
Against you?

30:44.914 --> 30:47.315
No. Against you.

30:47.316 --> 30:51.419
That's why you're staying
with your father tonight...

30:51.420 --> 30:54.283
Because if anything
ever happened to you, I...

30:57.186 --> 31:00.429
(Crying)

31:06.095 --> 31:08.937
(People speaking indistinctly)

31:08.938 --> 31:11.499
What's up?

31:11.500 --> 31:14.072
Do me a favor. Don't
parent my daughter.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.573
What are you talking about?

31:15.574 --> 31:17.345
Wilson polley made
a threat against Lacey,

31:17.346 --> 31:19.077
and I couldn't find her
for an hour last night

31:19.078 --> 31:21.279
because she was at a
party living in the moment

31:21.280 --> 31:23.081
or whatever it is
you told her to do.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.383
I told her not to let the
diabetes hold her back.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.185
I don't know anything
about a party.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.516
You are an adult figure.

31:28.517 --> 31:29.887
You gave her
permission to defy me.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.120
You're overreacting.

31:32.121 --> 31:34.122
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

31:34.123 --> 31:35.423
I'm sorry.

31:35.424 --> 31:38.196
I'm sorry that you've had
a rough time lately. I am.

31:38.197 --> 31:40.568
And you had a horrible,
horrible thing happen to you.

31:40.569 --> 31:42.370
But please...

31:42.371 --> 31:44.532
Don't put it on my child.

31:44.533 --> 31:46.534
Wow. You know
what? I'm surprised that

31:46.535 --> 31:49.407
you're even capable of
recognizing someone else's pain.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.480
Good for you.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.189
Nah. Don't really recognize 'em.

32:01.190 --> 32:02.290
Doesn't mean they weren't here.

32:02.291 --> 32:04.092
All right. Thanks for your time.

32:04.093 --> 32:05.493
Hey.

32:05.494 --> 32:07.695
The uniforms haven't
cleared the crime scene tape?

32:07.696 --> 32:09.527
Are you kidding? I
told 'em to leave it up.

32:09.528 --> 32:12.430
This just became the
hottest bar in Philly.

32:12.431 --> 32:14.132
People think murder's cool.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.065
They should spend
the day with us.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.238
Hold on a sec.

32:20.970 --> 32:23.471
One dead rat is
natural selection.

32:23.472 --> 32:25.473
Three is a clue.
We need to bag 'em.

32:25.474 --> 32:27.715
How do you think it's
related to the crime?

32:27.716 --> 32:30.718
You see the iridescent film
layer on the puddle surface?

32:30.719 --> 32:32.650
I bet it's a toxin that
the rats ingested.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.482
What if it came from
the killer's shoes?

32:34.483 --> 32:36.084
Wait a second. You're
thinking of Jack Gordon.

32:36.085 --> 32:37.485
He's a chem major.

32:37.486 --> 32:42.131
I mean, it's a long shot, but
what have we got to lose?

32:45.064 --> 32:48.997
And there you have it.

32:48.998 --> 32:51.439
The g.I. Tracts
of all three rats

32:51.440 --> 32:53.441
are inflamed with
caustic damage.

32:53.442 --> 32:55.443
That, with the lack of
internal hemorrhaging,

32:55.444 --> 32:57.275
suggests...

32:57.276 --> 32:59.307
Toxic ingestion.

32:59.308 --> 33:02.410
So what toxins did they
ingest from the puddle water?

33:02.411 --> 33:04.312
Surfactant chemicals.

33:04.313 --> 33:07.185
Sodium sulfate,
optical brighteners,

33:07.186 --> 33:08.356
sodium hypochlorite.

33:08.357 --> 33:09.517
Bleach.

33:09.518 --> 33:11.619
Industrial grade bleach...
Not sold in stores,

33:11.620 --> 33:13.321
not used by the bar.

33:13.322 --> 33:14.462
The most common buyers...

33:14.463 --> 33:17.365
Hotels, hospitals, and prisons.

33:17.366 --> 33:19.398
Wilson works in
the prison laundry.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.100
Oh, my god.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.133
He killed Niki shumaker himself.

33:25.534 --> 33:28.376
I hate to poke a hole
in your theory, Dr. Hunt,

33:28.377 --> 33:30.538
but Wilson's in prison.

33:30.539 --> 33:32.610
Exactly.

33:32.611 --> 33:36.744
It's the perfect alibi
for the perfect murder.

33:36.745 --> 33:38.446
(Indistinct conversations)

33:38.447 --> 33:39.747
(Megan) Listen, warden,

33:39.748 --> 33:41.349
it's pretty simple.

33:41.350 --> 33:43.221
Somebody let Wilson polley
out of jail four nights ago

33:43.222 --> 33:44.552
to kill Niki shumaker

33:44.553 --> 33:46.194
and then let him back in.

33:46.195 --> 33:47.355
In my experience,

33:47.356 --> 33:49.197
escaped convicts
don't come back.

33:49.198 --> 33:52.230
They do if they need
an alibi for murder.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.531
Do you know who the C.O. was

33:53.532 --> 33:55.233
on Wilson's
cellblock Friday night?

33:55.234 --> 33:56.664
Yes, Evan Arnold.

33:56.665 --> 34:00.539
In fact, I just asked him to
bring Wilson up to my office.

34:04.213 --> 34:05.373
Clear.

34:05.374 --> 34:07.645
My god.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.247
Alert security. Code red.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.549
Lock it down. Lock it down now!

34:11.550 --> 34:13.381
I need an a.P.B...

34:13.382 --> 34:15.223
(Alarm blaring) On
an escaped convict

34:15.224 --> 34:16.554
wearing a guard's uniform

34:16.555 --> 34:18.586
from Pennsylvania
state penitentiary.

34:18.587 --> 34:21.159
(Cell phone rings) (Man over
P.A.) We are on level-4 lockdown...

34:21.160 --> 34:23.531
Catch me if you can, detective.

34:23.532 --> 34:27.496
(Blaring continues)

34:36.605 --> 34:39.477
Wilson used a new
cell phone to call bud.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.648
We're tracking the GPS,

34:40.649 --> 34:42.810
and he's heading to
the Canadian border.

34:42.811 --> 34:44.352
That's out of our jurisdiction.

34:44.353 --> 34:46.684
Yeah. The U.S. marshals
are taking it from here.

34:46.685 --> 34:49.587
Did you find anything
at Evan Arnold's house?

34:49.588 --> 34:51.719
50 grand in cash stuffed
under the mattress.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.621
The going price
for a prison break.

34:53.622 --> 34:55.493
(Sighs)

34:55.494 --> 34:57.495
Listen, about this morning...

34:57.496 --> 34:59.667
It's fine.

34:59.668 --> 35:02.170
But I am done looking
out for you, Megan.

35:02.171 --> 35:03.331
(Knocks on door)

35:03.332 --> 35:04.832
Uh, you guys ready
to head over to bud's?

35:04.833 --> 35:06.374
Yes, let's go.

35:06.375 --> 35:07.635
(People speaking indistinctly)

35:07.636 --> 35:09.577
Are you coming to
the baby shower?

35:09.578 --> 35:11.509
Yeah. Yeah. I'll meet you there.

35:11.510 --> 35:14.643
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

35:16.785 --> 35:19.447
(Man) ♪ but it's all
right, it's all right ♪

35:19.448 --> 35:20.618
(Chuckles)

35:20.619 --> 35:21.789
(Sam) Nice wrapping paper.

35:21.790 --> 35:23.551
Are you laughing at me?

35:23.552 --> 35:25.153
Um... (Curtis) Unh-unh.

35:25.154 --> 35:27.225
It's the best he could
do with no information.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.557
You will never break bud
Morris, my friend. Never.

35:29.558 --> 35:31.299
And bud's a Teddy
bear compared to me.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.460
(Doorbell rings) That's true.

35:32.461 --> 35:34.532
I got it. I got it.
Gotta keep moving.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.634
Let her go. Don't want to get
in a pregnant woman's way.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.135
That's good advice. (Chuckles)

35:38.136 --> 35:39.867
Hey, guys. (Peter and Kate) Hi.

35:39.868 --> 35:41.469
Thanks for coming. (Ethan) Hey!

35:41.470 --> 35:42.640
Aw. Where's Megan?

35:42.641 --> 35:43.811
Oh, she was on her
way out when we left.

35:43.812 --> 35:45.173
Nice to see you.

35:45.174 --> 35:47.245
Well, come on in. Come in.

35:47.246 --> 35:48.416
(Telephone rings)

35:48.417 --> 35:49.577
(Sighs)

35:49.578 --> 35:51.679
(Ring)

35:51.680 --> 35:54.652
Kate, I swear. I am on my way.

35:54.653 --> 35:56.554
(Wilson) Hats off
to you, Dr. Hunt,

35:56.555 --> 35:59.156
for foiling my little plan.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.658
I underestimated you.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.789
Where are you?

36:01.790 --> 36:03.331
Beyond your reach.

36:03.332 --> 36:04.662
But don't worry.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.665
I won't be coming after
you or your precious Lacey.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.467
You've earned that,

36:09.468 --> 36:11.239
and my respect.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.740
You never had me fooled, Wilson.

36:12.741 --> 36:14.442
I got close,

36:14.443 --> 36:16.374
didn't I?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.376
You know, I think this is

36:18.377 --> 36:20.548
the first honest
conversation we've ever had.

36:20.549 --> 36:23.912
I agree. I don't want it to end.

36:38.627 --> 36:40.728
(Gasps and pants)

36:40.729 --> 36:42.900
(Grunts)

36:42.901 --> 36:44.272
(Chair clatters)

36:44.273 --> 36:47.876
I'm afraid it's gonna
be a long good-bye.

36:56.685 --> 36:58.616
Oops.

36:58.617 --> 37:01.218
Look what I found

37:01.219 --> 37:03.821
in the lab.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.693
It's almost

37:05.694 --> 37:07.855
like you left it there...

37:07.856 --> 37:10.728
Just for me.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.801
My friends are
gonna be here soon.

37:13.802 --> 37:16.764
Oh, you mean Peter?

37:16.765 --> 37:19.507
Well, he actually texted you.

37:19.508 --> 37:21.609
He was wondering where you were.

37:21.610 --> 37:24.572
So I took the Liberty

37:24.573 --> 37:26.774
to text him back.

37:26.775 --> 37:29.947
I told him you got held up.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.319
(Laughs)

37:31.320 --> 37:32.880
So you and I, we have

37:32.881 --> 37:36.485
all the time in the world.

37:38.727 --> 37:41.689
I'm not gonna beg.

37:41.690 --> 37:42.960
Well...

37:42.961 --> 37:46.033
You won't be able to.

37:46.034 --> 37:47.635
Mm.

37:47.636 --> 37:50.368
From now on...

37:50.369 --> 37:52.640
I'll be doing all the talking.

37:52.641 --> 37:55.473
You're so much more
interesting than the others.

37:55.474 --> 37:58.005
You should've heard their crying

37:58.006 --> 38:00.748
and their pleading
and the bargaining.

38:00.749 --> 38:04.612
Each of 'em too dumb to realize

38:04.613 --> 38:06.614
it was already over.

38:06.615 --> 38:07.755
(Laughs)

38:07.756 --> 38:09.857
But you...

38:09.858 --> 38:11.489
You're different.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.562
That's why this is
so special to me.

38:14.563 --> 38:16.994
For over three years...

38:16.995 --> 38:21.699
I've been dreaming of
ripping out your brain.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.901
Special treat...

38:23.902 --> 38:25.433
I'm gonna do this

38:25.434 --> 38:27.975
while you're still alive.

38:27.976 --> 38:29.607
Mm.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.710
(Elevator bell dings) Mm. Mm.

38:45.854 --> 38:48.897
(Both grunting)

38:51.500 --> 38:52.600
Ooh!

38:52.601 --> 38:54.532
(Grunts)

38:54.533 --> 38:55.803
Aah!

38:55.804 --> 38:57.865
(Grunts)

38:57.866 --> 38:58.767
Mm. Ugh!

38:58.768 --> 39:02.871
(Both grunting)

39:10.779 --> 39:13.652
(Grunts)

39:16.525 --> 39:17.926
(Both grunt)

39:21.029 --> 39:23.432
Mm. (Grunts)

39:26.965 --> 39:30.799
(Both grunting)

39:32.401 --> 39:33.872
(Gunshot) Oh!

39:38.877 --> 39:40.548
(Pants) (Wilson thuds)

39:40.549 --> 39:41.810
(Peter exhales)

39:44.913 --> 39:46.414
Oh, my god.

39:46.415 --> 39:47.585
Ooh.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.756
Oh, my god. Peter!

39:48.757 --> 39:49.887
Peter, c-come on.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.159
I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

39:52.160 --> 39:55.923
(Panting)

39:55.924 --> 39:57.465
(Voice breaking) Peter.

39:57.466 --> 39:59.927
Come on. It's gonna be okay.

39:59.928 --> 40:02.900
It's okay. It's okay.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.031
You hear me?

40:04.032 --> 40:05.773
(Sighs)

40:05.774 --> 40:07.836
Peter?
