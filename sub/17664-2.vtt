-That's impossible.

in such treachery.

I'd assumed that, following the death
of His late Majesty,

you would,
at the earliest appropriate moment,

49:01.106 --> 49:03.893

with the Royal Air Force.

49:03.983 --> 49:05.189
Yes, sir.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.527
I mentioned this to the Queen...

49:11.157 --> 49:14.570
The Queen Mother, this morning,
who then asked me,

49:14.661 --> 49:17.619
quite unusually,
to ask you whether you might like

49:17.705 --> 49:20.868
-to reconsider such a departure.
-Oh, sir?

49:20.959 --> 49:24.668
She felt that you had enjoyed
an uncommonly close association

49:24.754 --> 49:28.463
with her late husband
and earned notjust his trust,

49:28.550 --> 49:30.791
but the trust and affection
of the whole family.

49:30.885 --> 49:32.136
Thank you, sir.

49:32.220 --> 49:35.553
In the light of this, she wondered
whether you might consider

49:35.640 --> 49:37.221
staying on in a new role,

49:37.725 --> 49:41.058
as comptroller of

49:47.986 --> 49:49.692

But while I'm sure you're greatly flattered,
I don't expect you to accept the post,

49:55.535 --> 49:57.696
hence my discouragement of the offer.

49:57.787 --> 50:00.995
I didn't want Her Majesty to suffer
the embarrassment of a refusal.

50:01.124 --> 50:03.035
Why would I not accept, sir?

50:03.918 --> 50:06.330
Well, you're asking
the wrong question, Townsend.

50:06.421 --> 50:08.161
Why would you?

50:08.256 --> 50:10.872
You're a decorated war hero,

50:15.096 --> 50:17.303
It would take you away
from your wife and children.

more attractive.

that because no one has confronted you
about it that no one can know.

Allow me to disabuse you of that delusion.

I regret to tell you, that talk, ugly talk,
