WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:03.961
Mills, get me
a 35-foot ladder.
Got it.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.214
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:07.216 --> 00:09.509
I'm only seeing you.
I only want to see you.

00:09.927 --> 00:12.261
Treat her right.
I will.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.056
I'm over
being the grieving widow.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.724
You have always
been there for me, Matt.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.559
It's my pleasure.

00:19.395 --> 00:20.603
Hey, Lieutenant,
I was looking at the list

00:20.771 --> 00:22.438
of the up and coming
classes at the Academy

00:22.606 --> 00:23.773
and I'm trying to figure out
which ones to take

00:23.941 --> 00:25.400
to make the move to squad.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.026
I'm gonna be
artificially inseminated.

00:27.194 --> 00:30.363
And now I'm going
to browse through
potential sperm donors,

00:30.823 --> 00:33.157
and continue to look
for the perfect applicant.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.160
Fire department,
is there anybody in here?

00:37.830 --> 00:39.997
Hey, is your dad
gonna come back
to the house at all?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.959
He worked with my dad
and I just wanted to hear...

00:43.127 --> 00:44.711
I need to know
how my dad died.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.587
Henry was trying to prove
himself to you that night,

00:46.755 --> 00:48.589
and he took unnecessary
risks because of it.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.299
He was doing his job.
My ass!

00:50.467 --> 00:51.426
He was trying
to prove himself

00:51.593 --> 00:53.177
to the guy who slept
with his wife.

01:06.024 --> 01:07.692
Hey, Chief.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.902
I just thought
I'd catch you
before shift started.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.154
You caught me.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.322
Uh, good morning,
first of all.

01:13.907 --> 01:14.782
Morning.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.410
So, obviously I heard
what I heard last night.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.996
And I guess I'm just
trying to figure out

01:20.164 --> 01:21.956
what to do about it
now that it's kind of
out in the open.

01:22.124 --> 01:23.499
It's not out in the open.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.752
Well, I mean,
it's out in the open for me,

01:25.919 --> 01:27.545
because I don't know
if you're aware or not,

01:27.713 --> 01:29.422
but Pete and I are dating.

01:30.466 --> 01:31.799
I'm aware.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.802
So, you may also be aware
that Pete's become

01:34.970 --> 01:38.222
increasingly convinced
that people are keeping
secrets from him

01:38.724 --> 01:39.974
about his dad,
vis a vis...

01:43.520 --> 01:44.771
Are you gonna
tell him what's going on

01:44.938 --> 01:46.355
before he hears it
from Kelly's dad?

01:46.815 --> 01:49.609
Benny Severide is
not gonna be coming
around 51 anymore.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.695
Still, Pete is gonna keep
digging until he finds out.

01:52.863 --> 01:56.949
Gabby,
your dogged inquisitiveness

01:57.659 --> 01:58.826
is one of the qualities
that makes you

01:58.994 --> 02:01.496
such an effective paramedic.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.331
But it is of no use
to you in this matter,

02:03.499 --> 02:05.374
which is a private one.

02:08.420 --> 02:11.714
If you care about Mills
like I think you do...

02:11.882 --> 02:13.049
Drop it.

02:16.720 --> 02:17.887
I'll see you
back at the house.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.938
Hey.
Morning.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.689
Morning.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.526
We got scrapple
and we got eggs.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.902
Grab a seat.

02:34.029 --> 02:34.904
There you go.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.450
Thanks.

02:40.452 --> 02:44.330
So, um, Whoritsky's
offered me a teaching post,

02:44.498 --> 02:45.832
and I'm thinking
about doing it.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.460
Figured I could
come down and see you
every couple of weeks,

02:49.628 --> 02:51.003
hang out.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.798
What do you think?
Sounds good.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.759
Will probably have to
spend one more shift
at the house.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.178
Kind of re-familiarize myself
with a couple of things.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.597
So, why don't you tell Boden
I'll be there about noon?

03:02.349 --> 03:03.641
What the hell's going on
with you and Boden?

03:05.060 --> 03:07.353
Look, Wally and me,
we go way back.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.898
He and I,
one minute we're at
each other's throats

03:11.066 --> 03:13.901
and the next
I'm helping to put
a new deck on his house.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.112
Okay?
This is nothing new.

03:18.699 --> 03:23.703
Look, I promise you,
I'll be a choir boy, okay?

03:23.871 --> 03:25.162
A mute choir boy.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.000
Keep that
two and a half
on the roof line.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.377
I don't want
a flare-up spreading
to the other buildings.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.547
Oh, hey, sir, sir.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.048
You're gonna want
to stand back, okay?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.926
It's my restaurant,
are my employees safe?

03:41.597 --> 03:43.139
Hey, Casey,
you got a search status?

03:43.599 --> 03:46.100
Building's clear,
just opening up the ceiling.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.352
Pop a couple
of these tiles.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.980
Building was empty,
your people are out.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.565
Son of a bitch
said I'd pay,

03:52.733 --> 03:54.275
I never thought
he'd go this far.

03:54.443 --> 03:56.569
Yeah?
Ten years without
a grease fire.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.571
I opened four restaurants
in the union,

03:58.739 --> 04:00.114
suddenly he sees money.

04:00.282 --> 04:03.034
I refused to sign.
They send this thug!

04:03.994 --> 04:05.745
Sounds like you're gonna
want to talk to CPD.

04:05.913 --> 04:06.787
What good would that do?

04:06.955 --> 04:11.876
This guy's not gonna stop
until I'm ruined or dead.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.723
Okay, Chief,
we're almost done.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.683
Send in the engine
for the wash down.

04:30.145 --> 04:31.228
Whoa!

04:32.189 --> 04:33.606
Casey!

04:45.953 --> 04:46.953
Lieutenant!

04:50.165 --> 04:51.999
Mills, get out of here!

04:57.214 --> 04:59.006
Hit him with the hose!
Come on!

05:07.182 --> 05:08.557
Lieutenant!

05:13.105 --> 05:14.438
I'm okay.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.277
Thanks, Cruz.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.663
Seriously, it's fine.
It didn't burn
through my gear.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.790
Then what's this?

05:33.417 --> 05:35.042
Ow.
Hold still.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.752
It's just
a first-degree burn.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.754
Will you give me
that bandage?

05:44.261 --> 05:45.678
Couple more seconds
of whatever that was

05:45.846 --> 05:47.888
that dumped down on you,
it wouldn't have stopped
at the jacket.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.307
It smells like fuel.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.517
That's 'cause it was.

05:52.644 --> 05:54.979
Homemade gasoline
fire bombs in the ceiling.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.529
Back door was kicked in.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.281
It's not like whoever did it
was making an attempt

06:05.449 --> 06:06.574
to hide it was arson.

06:06.742 --> 06:09.410
CPD said they'd back seat
to my office on this one.

06:09.578 --> 06:10.870
On that union rep
who was threatened

06:11.038 --> 06:12.246
by the owner of the diner?

06:12.414 --> 06:14.040
Yeah, your owner,
Stuart Tuxhorn,

06:14.499 --> 06:17.251
filed a complaint
against a Lou Krinsky
last month.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.462
We're checking it out,
but with a case like this,

06:19.629 --> 06:21.130
the evidence is
circumstantial at best.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.841
Yeah.
Did I say something funny?

06:24.009 --> 06:26.927
Yeah, this union guy,
if he's connected
to city politics,

06:27.095 --> 06:29.847
you can't tell me that
someone isn't already
trying to get this buried.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.975
Look, we're good here.
Just keep us posted.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.481
Can I talk to you a sec?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.902
My old man wants to
come by the house again.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.404
Kelly, I don't think
that's a good idea.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.783
Whatever business
you guys got,
that's your business.

06:48.950 --> 06:52.286
But he said he'll
be a choir boy,
and it's one more shift.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.663
Here's the deal, Kelly.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.415
I don't know
what your dad has told you...

06:58.460 --> 06:59.835
He hasn't told me dick.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.129
Some guys when they retire

07:02.297 --> 07:03.881
and they come back
around the job,

07:04.424 --> 07:05.841
for some reason
they gotta tear it down.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.804
I'm no psychologist,
but your dad,

07:09.971 --> 07:13.057
he's always been
really adept at
tearing things down.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.435
So, that he's the only one
left standing.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.774
He has a take on how
Peter Mills' father died.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.944
And it is untrue.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.740
And that would hurt Pete if
that were thrown in his face.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.617
I will not allow
your father to do it.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.620
So, it would be in
everybody's best interest

07:34.788 --> 07:36.956
if you were to
meet your father
in another house.

07:38.333 --> 07:41.544
So, you could tell him.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.338
Or I could tell him.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.386
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.805
Uh, my buddy Jason Baseden
over at Squad 1,

07:52.973 --> 07:53.764
you remember him?

07:53.932 --> 07:55.432
Yeah, sure,
I remember Jason.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.686
Well, he heard
you were in town
and he was like,

07:58.854 --> 07:59.687
"Get your old man over here!"

07:59.855 --> 08:00.980
It's a newer house,

08:01.148 --> 08:03.023
all the latest bells
and whistles and,
you know,

08:03.191 --> 08:04.817
I can stop by later
if we don't get a call.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.654
So, stop over there, okay?
Jason's expecting you.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.614
Yeah, sure, of course.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.199
No problem.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.290
Hey.
Hey.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.667
Um, hey, don't be jealous,

08:21.835 --> 08:24.879
but Dolores
down at the records
department of the Academy...

08:25.046 --> 08:26.797
I sent her a gift basket
of cookies and brownies,

08:26.965 --> 08:28.757
just trying to
butter her up to try
and get information

08:28.925 --> 08:30.759
on the fire my dad died in,

08:30.927 --> 08:33.137
and it worked.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.807
She sent me over
the battalion Chief's
original report.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.727
And I am starting to see
why Boden and Kelly's dad

08:39.895 --> 08:40.895
don't want to talk about it.

08:41.980 --> 08:44.857
Two firefighters dying
and the other
firefighter's wife

08:45.275 --> 08:47.443
was pregnant
with her first child.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.445
Tough to relive through,
you know?

08:50.113 --> 08:51.280
Yeah.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.618
Well,
Dolores is still searching,

08:55.785 --> 08:57.369
she's gonna send me
anything that she finds.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.835
Hey, guys, what does
"ebullient" mean again?

09:05.003 --> 09:05.711
No idea.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.422
Bull-like.
To resemble a bull.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.674
Means cheerful
and energetic.

09:10.842 --> 09:11.800
Or that.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.469
All right, thanks.
Why?

09:13.637 --> 09:15.763
One of these guys used it
to describe himself.

09:15.931 --> 09:18.682
Any guy that
describes himself
as ebullient,

09:19.517 --> 09:20.809
you don't want his sperm.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.937
Yeah, right. Thanks.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.899
How much longer
you gonna be on
this donor kick?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.359
Until I find the right guy.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.862
And you can just
look at 'em on
your computer.

09:32.030 --> 09:34.156
Mmm-hmm.
Like I'm doing right now.
Correct.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.116
I admire your gumption.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.994
Most other people would,
you know,

09:39.579 --> 09:41.080
keep that behind closed doors.

09:41.957 --> 09:43.374
Every time
Cindy gets pregnant,

09:43.541 --> 09:46.835
Herrmann plasters
her sonogram images
all over the fridge.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.964
And what?
I'm supposed to
hide in a corner?

09:50.507 --> 09:52.967
I said
I admire your gumption.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.426
Well, thanks.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.349
Hey, Heather.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.185
I was in the neighborhood.
Great.

10:04.521 --> 10:08.107
Hey, um, did you notice
an earring in your truck?

10:08.275 --> 10:09.608
I'm missing one.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.070
Uh, I didn't see it, but I...
I can take a look.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.281
Thank you.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.866
Oh, and by the way,
Saturday the kids are

10:18.034 --> 10:19.868
staying with my parents,
and I was planning

10:20.036 --> 10:21.829
on having dinner
with one of my girlfriends,

10:21.997 --> 10:23.122
but her dad's
not doing so hot,

10:23.290 --> 10:24.832
so she had to fly out
to Jacksonville.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.917
But I've already
got that night free

10:27.085 --> 10:29.378
so I was thinking,
why don't we grab dinner?

10:37.220 --> 10:39.054
Smoke eater in the house!

10:40.598 --> 10:42.141
God damn it!

10:42.600 --> 10:44.435
Donut man in the house!

10:45.186 --> 10:46.812
Donuts, everybody!

10:46.980 --> 10:48.272
Donuts!

10:48.440 --> 10:49.481
Come and get it!

10:49.899 --> 10:52.067
Hey, what happened to
going to Squad 1?

10:52.736 --> 10:54.111
I didn't want to.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.031
Come on, you guys,
let's get a donut.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.032
Hi, Wally.

11:09.627 --> 11:12.504
You know, I used to
bring those to the ladies
in Arson all the time.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.173
One of them, Ruthie,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.425
she didn't have anything
personal in her office.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.428
I mean, nothing.
Not a family photo, nothing.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.430
All she had
behind her desk,
right in the middle

11:21.598 --> 11:23.682
of her tack board
was this quote,

11:24.142 --> 11:26.185
"If you can't
do anything about it,

11:26.353 --> 11:27.561
"don't worry about it."

11:27.729 --> 11:30.606
And I am, like, "Man, this
Ruthie is locked into some

11:30.774 --> 11:32.524
"higher level stuff," right?

11:32.692 --> 11:33.734
Benny,
can I talk to you real quick?

11:34.736 --> 11:35.611
Yeah, just a second.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.114
So anyway, Ruthie retires
and I go in to say good-bye

11:39.282 --> 11:41.325
and I look at the board,
and the quote is still there.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.494
And I say, "Hey, Ruthie,
you forgot your quote."

11:43.661 --> 11:44.953
And she says,
"That's not mine,
that was here when

11:45.121 --> 11:46.413
"I moved into the office."

11:46.581 --> 11:48.415
All this time I thought

11:48.583 --> 11:50.751
she was like this oracle
or something, you know?

11:50.919 --> 11:52.586
Anyway, I kept the quote.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.380
What the hell?
Couldn't hurt.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.340
Lead the way, boss.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.473
You're not welcome here.
Yeah?

12:04.641 --> 12:06.558
Is that why you had my son
hustle me down the road?

12:06.726 --> 12:07.976
You are not welcome here.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.521
Twenty-five years on the job,
15 of them in this house,

12:10.688 --> 12:12.940
nobody tells me
when I can come and go!

12:13.441 --> 12:15.067
Whatever you two are trying
not to bring attention to,

12:15.235 --> 12:16.235
guess what?

12:16.403 --> 12:17.403
You're bringing
attention to it.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.029
We got this, Kelly.
No, you don't.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.492
He wants to stay here
one more shift, that's it.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.619
Can you keep
your mouth shut
while you're here?

12:25.787 --> 12:26.829
Who the hell are you
to tell me to...

12:26.996 --> 12:29.039
It's a yes or no question!

12:30.458 --> 12:33.460
Lou Krinsky,
restaurant workers
local 553 is here.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.462
Looking to talk to us.
We'll be right there.

12:35.630 --> 12:37.923
Do I need to turn
the hose on you guys?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.633
We're good. We're fine.

12:39.801 --> 12:40.592
We'll be right out.

12:47.183 --> 12:49.226
You always had
all the answers.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.314
But I'm gonna tell you,

12:55.024 --> 12:56.733
this is your only shift.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.068
You try and show up
again for a second,

12:58.236 --> 13:00.737
I will put an ass-kicking on
you 20 years in the making.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.865
Ooh! You still got it, Wally.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.575
I was starting to think
all those bugles

13:04.742 --> 13:06.368
had turned you into
a big marshmallow.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.212
That's the way
it's always been
with me and him.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.508
You didn't own this house.
You rented it.

13:21.676 --> 13:24.261
And I'm here now,
so show me some respect.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.393
Just curious why a report
coming from this house

13:31.561 --> 13:33.061
has the Arson department
trying to finger me

13:33.229 --> 13:34.354
for burning down
a restaurant.

13:34.522 --> 13:37.524
That report conveyed
the owner's statement
to us, that's all.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.484
Oh, okay.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.486
Well, then I would like
to make a report.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.613
Tuxhorn...

13:42.780 --> 13:43.739
Rapes baby seals.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.407
Put that in the report,
have him have to defend it.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.159
This is between you
and the fire investigations.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.828
Yeah, and it got that far
because you guys took the word

13:49.996 --> 13:51.288
of some sweatshop owner

13:51.456 --> 13:52.915
over that of a fellow
union brother.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.042
Why don't you
show some courtesy,
talk to me first?

13:55.210 --> 13:57.711
We're not talking
about a busboy
who got fired, Lou...

13:57.879 --> 13:59.171
This is serious business.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.089
I know.
I'm being accused
of starting it!

14:01.508 --> 14:03.175
We just wrote down
what we saw and heard.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.639
Guy's a skull-cracker.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.150
You're awfully quiet.
Everything all right?

14:22.737 --> 14:24.071
All right, let's...

14:24.239 --> 14:25.864
Let's say that if
you knew something...

14:28.535 --> 14:29.868
What?
Nothing.

14:30.620 --> 14:31.662
No, no, no.
Don't give me that.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.288
What? What is it?

14:34.582 --> 14:35.791
Um...

14:46.928 --> 14:49.888
Oh... Oh!

14:54.310 --> 14:56.144
Oh, goodness gracious.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.063
I'm not here to judge you.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.314
I didn't... See, that...

14:59.482 --> 15:03.151
When... When the... What?

15:03.861 --> 15:05.904
I'm not here to judge you.
I just want to
know how it works.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.198
Who else knows?
No one.

15:08.783 --> 15:09.866
Dawson?

15:10.451 --> 15:11.493
Just Dawson.

15:11.661 --> 15:12.703
Oh, Shay.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.121
Don't worry.
She's sworn to secrecy.

15:14.539 --> 15:15.956
But, Mouch, I gotta ask.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.000
Six foot? 175?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.293
I aged out.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.754
It was my understanding
they were gonna
take that down.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.424
Fine. Look, I got
a million questions
I wanna ask you.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.758
Can I? Please?

15:28.469 --> 15:29.761
Okay, I'm ready.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.139
Great.
First off, the sperm...

15:32.307 --> 15:33.432
Oh!

15:33.600 --> 15:35.601
Truck 81,
Ambulance 61, restaurant fire.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.114
Mr. Tuxhorn.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.117
I never should have told you
'cause he's gonna bury me now.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.369
Stay back.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.997
I'm the one who called.

15:57.165 --> 15:58.790
I was making my stop
and I saw a man on fire

15:58.958 --> 16:00.042
running through
the restaurant.

16:04.088 --> 16:06.256
Okay, no one goes in.
Hit it from the window.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.674
Quick takedown.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.843
If that driver's right,
this is gonna be a recovery.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.773
Cleared the dining
room and bathrooms.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.484
No bodies.
Moving into the kitchen.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.823
Guess I don't need to
remind you to keep your
eyes on the ceiling.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.950
That's exactly
what I'm doing.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.963
Hey...

16:48.091 --> 16:50.008
It's the same entry point
as the last fire.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.138
Wherever he is,
he's long gone.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.350
This is Casey.
Building's clear.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.031
Uh, Casey...

17:16.202 --> 17:17.953
We need a medic.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.629
Let's turn him over.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.177
Agonal breathing.
Fire may have
scorched his lungs.

17:34.345 --> 17:35.595
How bad?
I don't know.

17:35.763 --> 17:36.847
Airway looks pretty fried.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.891
His arms are burned.
Can't get a line in.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.351
He's got minutes at best.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.811
We move him or lose him.
Give us a hand?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.771
On three. Very gentle.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.274
One, two, three.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.610
61 to Main,
let Lakeshore know
we are two minutes out

17:50.778 --> 17:52.320
with a burn victim.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.989
Dawson...

18:00.163 --> 18:01.955
61 to Main.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.958
Cancel that.
Victim is DOA.

18:05.126 --> 18:06.877
We will transport
from scene for safety.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.427
Well, we verified it.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.763
Krinsky's alibi clears him
from the second fire.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.639
Come on,
he's union muscle.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.225
He could have had
one of his knuckleheads
torch both places.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.769
I'm not arguing with that.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.938
But as of now we don't
have actionable evidence.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.565
I got a drawer
in the morgue
full of evidence.

18:28.733 --> 18:30.400
I don't care if the man
inside is homeless or a CEO,

18:30.568 --> 18:31.693
he didn't deserve
the death he got.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.738
Oh, and I think he did?
Come on, give me a break.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.866
The guy who owns
these restaurants
is fearing for his life.

18:38.034 --> 18:38.950
We need proof.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.078
Do I really need to explain
arson investigation
to you guys?

18:42.538 --> 18:44.039
It takes a while.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.045
Let's go back to that
second fire and look around.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.672
Yeah. All right.
Cool?

18:52.840 --> 18:55.050
Yeah.
Take your dad with you.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.553
Chief, he gave his word
that he'd keep his
mouth shut around here...

18:58.721 --> 18:59.721
I know he's
a pain in the ass,

18:59.889 --> 19:01.139
but he's a hell of
an arson investigator.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.475
Oh, yeah.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.363
You know, I could cook you
up something if you'd like.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.074
Oh, that's all right.
Thanks, though.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.537
I didn't know
that you and my dad
were on Squad together.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.622
And, uh...

19:26.249 --> 19:28.083
The other firefighter
who died with him.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.210
That's right.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.962
Ross McGowan.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.214
Two years on the job.
About your age.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.967
Had his whole
life ahead of him.

19:38.052 --> 19:41.471
Never got to meet his
daughter. A real shame.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.933
Yeah,
I'm sorry to bring it up.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.810
I know it must be
really hard to relive.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.979
Yeah.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.648
Never should have happened.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.610
How do you mean?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.364
Well, like you said...

19:59.532 --> 20:01.074
It's hard to relive.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.954
Respectfully,
Mr. Severide, I get the sense

20:06.122 --> 20:08.540
that there's something
you really want to tell me.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.045
Hey.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.047
Let's take a ride.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.974
So, like the pamphlet says,

20:26.142 --> 20:28.560
you just do it in a cup?

20:29.270 --> 20:30.687
No, uh,

20:30.855 --> 20:34.399
a gossamer-winged
stork flies down and...

20:36.027 --> 20:37.235
Yes.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.988
And have you had
contact with any of the...

20:40.156 --> 20:42.282
With the kids?
God, no!

20:43.075 --> 20:45.076
Because...
I'm Father Flanagan?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.328
No way!

20:47.163 --> 20:49.706
I treasure my privacy.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.876
Damn. It just...

20:54.170 --> 20:55.128
It seems so impersonal.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.005
Let me just stop
you right there.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.050
My cousin Ted
and his wife Patty,

21:00.217 --> 21:02.886
they tried for a long time,
couldn't conceive.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.888
They decided
to go the A.I. Route.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.806
That's shorthand
for artificial...

21:06.974 --> 21:08.141
I got it.
Okay.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.812
So, now they have
a lovely daughter, Elsa,

21:12.980 --> 21:14.814
who is the light
of their lives.

21:14.982 --> 21:18.777
And that family
is filled with
nothing but love,

21:18.945 --> 21:21.446
despite the clinical origins.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.406
That's beautiful.

21:23.574 --> 21:26.034
Is that why you
became a donor?
Because of them?

21:26.744 --> 21:27.869
No. The cash.

21:28.454 --> 21:32.457
125 a pop.
That's what they call
a renewable resource.

21:34.085 --> 21:36.252
I don't know, man.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.338
Might have to figure
something else out.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.977
So, Matt, was that
Andy Darden's widow

21:52.144 --> 21:53.853
I saw you with at
the Academy dinner?

21:56.941 --> 21:59.234
Yeah. Heather.
That was her.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.194
She just needed a ride.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.905
It's good to see
you guys haven't
turned your back on her.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.116
That's important.
Yeah. Absolutely.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.826
I'll take the back.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.754
Both buildings
were broken into
from the rear entry.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.381
Gas accelerants were used.

22:21.549 --> 22:22.674
Okay.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.931
I don't know about
this teaching gig.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.600
Why not?

22:32.768 --> 22:34.185
Job's changed too much.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.647
It's almost exactly
the same.
It's just better gear.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.442
Well, the people
have changed
is what I'm saying.

22:41.110 --> 22:44.571
Back when I came up,
you fought a war at 18.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.698
You had kids by
the time you were 22.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.159
You'd lived a life.
You were a man.

22:50.661 --> 22:51.870
Now these kids are
coming straight out

22:52.038 --> 22:53.455
of their parents
basements to the firehouse.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.665
What the hell can I teach
somebody like that?

22:56.542 --> 22:57.584
Like him.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.628
What? Hadley? He's fine.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.422
Yeah. Okay.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.426
They still have wars.
People still pop out kids.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.553
I don't know why you
gotta piss on everything.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.769
Rubber.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.395
From the sole of a sneaker.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.147
That bus driver was right.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.149
Somebody was on fire
and running through here.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.485
What was
the homeless guy wearing?

23:24.153 --> 23:25.111
He had boots on.

23:25.279 --> 23:27.280
Then we're looking
for somebody else.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.199
It wouldn't be him.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.534
So, this thing collapses...

23:38.167 --> 23:39.626
Hadley.
Yeah.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.172
Quit playing grab ass,
would you?

23:48.302 --> 23:49.886
Look at this.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.973
You see that?
Pry marks.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.101
This door wasn't
breached from the outside.

23:57.311 --> 24:00.814
Somebody had a key.
The owner
or somebody he hired.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.482
They let themselves
in the front door

24:02.650 --> 24:04.192
and then they
pried this open.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.444
Make it look like
it was broken in
from the outside.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.029
You gotta be kidding me.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.614
Inside job.

24:15.538 --> 24:16.913
Thank you. Appreciate it.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.791
Fifteen minutes after the
second fire was called in.

24:20.334 --> 24:22.544
An 18-year-old kid walked
into an urgent care unit

24:22.711 --> 24:23.711
five blocks from the scene.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.505
He had second-
and third-degree burns.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.006
Claimed it was
a barbecue mishap.

24:28.259 --> 24:29.884
Memorial went
and picked him up.
He's there now.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.596
I want to head down there
and check it out.
Kelly...

24:33.764 --> 24:35.640
I don't like getting lied to.
I don't like getting worked.

24:35.808 --> 24:36.975
And if someone other
than that union guy

24:37.143 --> 24:38.810
got that homeless man killed,
I want to know.

24:42.815 --> 24:43.898
Yeah, I'm covered.

24:45.651 --> 24:46.901
Hit it.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.207
What's up, Omar?

25:02.459 --> 25:04.460
Lieutenant Severide, CFD.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.212
Oh, geez.

25:06.797 --> 25:10.216
Damn barbecue. Didn't know
the gas was on, and boom.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.093
Lucky I'm alive.

25:12.261 --> 25:13.595
Where were you standing?

25:14.638 --> 25:16.222
Right in front of the grill,
trying to light it.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.766
Then how'd you
burn your legs?

25:19.852 --> 25:21.060
I don't know.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.062
It was a big ol
fireball, though.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.607
Those aren't
barbecue burns, Omar.
I'd know.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.358
I've responded to 20 of them.

25:27.860 --> 25:28.568
I swear to God...

25:28.736 --> 25:29.986
Then they're gonna test
the shoes you were wearing

25:30.154 --> 25:31.654
against the rubber fixed
to the floor in that diner,

25:31.822 --> 25:32.906
and it's all gonna go south.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.158
Why? For what?
I didn't do nothing.

25:36.285 --> 25:37.869
A guy was killed
in that second fire.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.956
No. No, no, no, man.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.833
Look, I'm not a cop.

25:44.919 --> 25:45.835
I just want to know
what happened,

25:46.003 --> 25:47.670
and I'll help you
any way I can before
the cops get involved.

25:47.838 --> 25:49.589
And they're gonna
get involved soon.

25:52.718 --> 25:53.843
Okay.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.054
All right, maybe...

25:56.597 --> 25:58.348
There's one thing
maybe you can help me with.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.183
I'll try.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.606
It was an insurance scam.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.026
Tuxhorn and his wife wanted
two of the diners to go down

26:10.194 --> 26:12.070
and they was gonna lay
it off on some union dude

26:12.238 --> 26:13.529
who he was beefing with.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.241
And he asked my dad
to help him do it.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.660
My dad owes him
a lot of money,

26:18.827 --> 26:20.870
so he said
he was in to settle up.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.666
But my dad, he got a knee
replacement surgery last year

26:24.833 --> 26:26.626
and he ain't too quick.

26:27.795 --> 26:28.962
So, I said I'd do it.

26:29.964 --> 26:31.547
I was pouring the gas...

26:32.132 --> 26:33.716
I don't know.

26:35.302 --> 26:37.470
Maybe the fumes hit
a pilot light or something.

26:39.056 --> 26:41.724
And I was just running
through the restaurant
all on fire,

26:42.434 --> 26:44.352
and Tuxhorn put me
out and he took me here

26:44.520 --> 26:47.814
and he said to say
it was a barbecue accident.

26:49.066 --> 26:51.526
Look, man,
I'll take the rap for it.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.070
I just gotta leave
my dad out of it.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.907
Can I do that?

26:58.909 --> 27:00.910
Can I leave my dad
out of it with the cops?

27:06.083 --> 27:07.542
Don't bring up his name.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.087
Okay.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.007
Thank you.

27:22.391 --> 27:24.684
Did somebody
change his food?

27:24.852 --> 27:26.644
'Cause there is
something going on here.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.271
Where's Herrmann?

27:29.023 --> 27:30.690
Bar management seminar.

27:31.734 --> 27:32.775
You guys close to opening?

27:32.943 --> 27:35.069
Uh, a few weeks...
Hopefully.

27:35.237 --> 27:36.404
Hey, Shay,
where's your iPad?

27:36.905 --> 27:38.990
Put it away for a bit.
Did you find a donor?

27:39.158 --> 27:40.408
Regrouping.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.452
So, you're not going
the whole sperm donor
route anymore?

27:42.619 --> 27:43.661
What is this,
an interrogation?

27:43.829 --> 27:45.580
I told you,
I'm regrouping.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.756
So, uh, who asked who out?
I'm just curious.

27:56.759 --> 27:59.594
Um, wait.
You did, right?

27:59.762 --> 28:00.803
What?

28:00.971 --> 28:02.805
Yeah, you asked me to
dinner that one night.

28:03.307 --> 28:04.849
Oh, no, that wasn't a date.

28:16.570 --> 28:17.987
Damn.
What's up?

28:18.405 --> 28:20.239
Dolores from Records,
she sent me
an email earlier.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.200
I just...
I can't open it on my phone.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.869
I'm...
I'm gonna try it in there.

28:44.973 --> 28:47.016
Hey, Kelly, great job.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.477
Hey, thanks, Chief.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.105
You too, Benny.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.690
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

28:59.613 --> 29:00.905
How about I get
a cup of coffee
before I take off?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.365
All right.

29:03.700 --> 29:06.035
Hey, you got a second?
Yeah.

29:13.961 --> 29:14.919
What?

29:15.087 --> 29:15.920
So, how are you?

29:17.798 --> 29:19.090
Um, what's going on?

29:19.591 --> 29:20.716
So, here's the deal.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.468
You know I've done
thorough research

29:22.636 --> 29:24.846
on this whole
insemination thing.

29:25.472 --> 29:28.933
And today I got...
Well, I guess
an accidental window

29:29.101 --> 29:30.935
into how
the whole process works,

29:31.103 --> 29:33.646
and it really
left me feeling...

29:35.107 --> 29:36.357
Hollow.
Okay.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.651
And, you know,
I've been searching
for the perfect guy

29:38.819 --> 29:40.027
to be the father
of my baby.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.322
Someone honorable,
strong, good-looking.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.366
I mean, sue me. And...

29:45.534 --> 29:48.744
And maybe even
someone who would
want to be

29:48.912 --> 29:50.955
part of the child's life.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.791
And someone who would
want to celebrate, you know,

29:53.959 --> 29:55.543
how beautiful it could be.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.503
With me...

29:57.671 --> 30:01.048
A cool chick who's
not gonna freak out

30:01.216 --> 30:04.427
and they'll never have
to worry about, you know,

30:04.595 --> 30:07.096
me wanting a divorce
or trying to take
all their money,

30:07.264 --> 30:09.223
or be a bitch, or...

30:18.901 --> 30:21.110
Kelly, I want to know
if you'd like to
have a baby with me.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.156
Look, Shay, I...

30:25.324 --> 30:26.449
No, no, no.
Let me finish.

30:26.617 --> 30:29.827
And we'd go through
the insemination process...

30:29.995 --> 30:32.705
Um...
And... And, yeah.

30:32.873 --> 30:34.499
Okay, that's it. I'm done.

30:37.127 --> 30:38.461
I don't...
I don't know what to say.

30:38.629 --> 30:39.921
That's okay.

30:40.088 --> 30:43.299
I just... I just want
you to think about it.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.176
I...
Thank you.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.762
And listen,
if the answer's no,

30:50.182 --> 30:52.934
I mean, there won't even
be a hiccup between us.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.144
It... It's okay.
It'll be solid.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.146
Always, you and me.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.439
Okay?

31:00.067 --> 31:01.400
Uh...

31:07.824 --> 31:10.076
Okay, that's it.
I'm outta here.

31:10.244 --> 31:11.244
Great to meet you, Ben.

31:11.411 --> 31:12.411
Nice seeing you again.

31:12.579 --> 31:13.704
Such a pleasure.
Real pleasure.
Good to see you.

31:13.872 --> 31:14.830
Thanks for the donuts.

31:14.998 --> 31:15.998
Yup.
Take care, Benny.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.917
Hey. Mr. Severide,
can I talk to you
in private?

31:18.085 --> 31:20.294
Actually, I'm just
taking off.
It was nice meeting you.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.129
Yeah, please...

31:23.423 --> 31:24.799
I really need
to talk to you.

31:26.176 --> 31:27.385
Can you make it quick?

31:29.012 --> 31:30.221
Sure.

31:30.389 --> 31:33.307
Um, the Lambert Tree Award.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.811
It's the highest award
awarded to a firefighter.

31:38.814 --> 31:42.608
My father was nominated,
and everyone up the line
signed off on it...

31:43.610 --> 31:44.694
Except for you.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.238
Just curious to why.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.996
Some other time, kid, okay?

31:55.706 --> 31:57.206
Is this what you're
trying to say to me?

31:58.208 --> 32:00.042
Do you feel bad about
not signing off for it?

32:00.210 --> 32:01.627
That even though my
father was a hero...

32:01.795 --> 32:03.087
And even though
he gave his life...

32:03.255 --> 32:05.172
It's an award for valor!
Benny.

32:11.638 --> 32:12.888
He wants to hear it.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.683
I'm gonna tell him.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.190
In the middle of that fire,
your father panicked

32:23.609 --> 32:24.650
and pulled off his mask,

32:24.818 --> 32:26.152
which would have
been his business,

32:26.320 --> 32:28.654
except another guy died
trying to save him.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.241
So, no, I didn't sign it.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.493
Because I could not
in good faith
reward someone

32:34.661 --> 32:36.203
for demonstrating
cowardice...

32:53.388 --> 32:56.015
You want to know
why Boden thinks
your father wasn't at fault?

32:57.434 --> 32:58.893
Do you?

33:11.782 --> 33:13.491
'Cause he's an optimist,
I guess.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.208
I'll see you
back at your house.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.003
Mills...

33:26.838 --> 33:28.589
You are off duty
until further notice.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.634
Get your gear.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.761
Wait for Benny
to get off site,

33:33.929 --> 33:35.930
and you go home
and you'll wait
to hear from me.

33:40.936 --> 33:43.020
Rest of you,
get back to work.

33:57.619 --> 33:59.870
Hey, you okay?

34:00.372 --> 34:01.747
No.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.252
Look, I totally get
what led up to that
and I am so sorry,

34:06.420 --> 34:08.295
but you can't just go
around punching people.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.382
My dad wasn't able
to defend himself.
So I did.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.807
We were all real close.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.475
Henry and me.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.853
Benny. Our wives.

34:25.522 --> 34:26.772
Then Ingrid and Henry,
they separated.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.691
My wife left me.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.193
It was during that time.

34:33.029 --> 34:33.863
It just happened.

34:35.407 --> 34:37.116
Then I realized
that Henry might have

34:37.284 --> 34:39.034
still had feelings for her,

34:40.662 --> 34:42.538
and I may have
moved too quick,

34:42.706 --> 34:44.415
so I stepped back
just to see...

34:46.251 --> 34:47.710
And I was right.

34:50.046 --> 34:51.797
Henry moved back
in after a month.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.925
Ingrid always says
I broke her heart.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.055
So, if you think that
that's something that

35:01.057 --> 35:03.142
Peter needs
or wants to know,

35:04.311 --> 35:05.978
I'll go to his
place after shift.

35:07.022 --> 35:08.272
I'll tell him.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.650
Is what Benny said true?

35:13.820 --> 35:15.321
Not from
where I was standing.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.161
Matt.
Mmm?

35:22.579 --> 35:24.455
You have, like,
two utensils
in this kitchen.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.415
Yeah, it's on
my to-do list.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.918
You've been busy, huh?

35:29.753 --> 35:32.338
Yeah, it's been one
thing after another lately.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.633
Have you been dating?

35:36.259 --> 35:37.760
Since Hallie?

35:40.388 --> 35:43.933
Uh, there was someone
for a minute, maybe less.

35:45.352 --> 35:46.393
Wasn't the right time.

35:47.854 --> 35:48.938
Sorry to hear that.

35:49.523 --> 35:50.856
What are you gonna do?

35:51.274 --> 35:53.025
Damn that smells good.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.946
First home-cooked
meal I've had since...

35:58.031 --> 35:59.490
I don't even know.

36:00.408 --> 36:01.992
It sucks having to
come home to
an empty house,

36:02.160 --> 36:03.160
doesn't it?

36:04.412 --> 36:05.579
Yeah.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.793
We don't have to be alone.
We don't deserve to be.

36:10.961 --> 36:12.628
We're good people.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.089
Why can't we be happy?

36:24.140 --> 36:25.307
Heather...

36:27.561 --> 36:29.019
I'm really glad
you're here.

36:29.646 --> 36:32.147
And if it was under
different circumstances,

36:32.315 --> 36:33.941
believe me...

36:36.361 --> 36:38.153
But Andy was one
of my best friends.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.447
And he was your husband,
and...

36:45.161 --> 36:46.704
I think
we should honor that.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.917
You know what?
You're right.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.253
Let's just
count our blessings.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.090
Dinner and a movie.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.135
Let's get the movie ready.

37:23.116 --> 37:24.617
Hey, Bruiser.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.214
What's the word?
You heard anything?

37:41.051 --> 37:42.885
Yeah. I, um...

37:43.720 --> 37:45.012
I spoke to Boden briefly.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.555
What did he say?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.892
Well,
he hasn't heard from Benny,

37:50.060 --> 37:52.144
so the hope is that
he doesn't raise a stink.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.941
If that's the case,
then hopefully this thing
will stay in house.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.277
Boden says to just
sit tight for now.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.571
That's all he said?

38:03.531 --> 38:05.824
That's all he said to me.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.206
Okay, look...

38:13.416 --> 38:15.668
Can I just say
that even though I'm

38:15.835 --> 38:18.170
maybe in a jam
right now, I feel...

38:19.839 --> 38:21.256
I feel lighter.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.177
'Cause since forever

38:25.345 --> 38:27.805
I've been carrying around
this weight of not knowing.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.682
And I could always
just tell that there was

38:29.849 --> 38:33.268
something out there that
wasn't being told to me.

38:36.439 --> 38:39.525
At least now I can...
I can move on.

38:46.116 --> 38:47.282
Hey...

38:47.450 --> 38:49.451
What Benny said
isn't true.

38:49.619 --> 38:51.412
Look, I don't want to talk
about it anymore, okay?

38:51.579 --> 38:52.705
Baby, it's not true...

38:52.872 --> 38:55.249
Look, I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.052
Heather.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.586
He's just like his old man.

39:40.754 --> 39:42.755
It was Henry Mills
against the world.

39:43.173 --> 39:44.882
The guy always
had a problem.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.217
So, if people
want to knock me
for being arrogant

39:47.385 --> 39:48.469
or whatever, let them.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.846
At least
I was un-conflicted.

39:51.014 --> 39:52.639
And in this job,
you better damn well

39:52.807 --> 39:55.142
have that going for you,
or you and your
buddies' badges

39:55.310 --> 39:57.269
will end up on the wall
at the Academy.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.646
Well, I didn't know
his old man,
but I know Peter.

39:59.814 --> 40:03.150
And from what I've seen,
the kid has heart.

40:03.860 --> 40:04.902
He has courage.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.779
Yeah,
well I've seen your squad.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.822
Maybe you're not
the best judge of character.

40:19.501 --> 40:20.751
Look, Kelly, I...

40:21.878 --> 40:24.213
I really did come down here
to spend time with you.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.423
I didn't mean for
any of this to happen.

40:27.509 --> 40:29.635
And if anything I did
reflects poorly on you,

40:29.803 --> 40:31.095
I'm sorry about that.

40:35.725 --> 40:38.685
I guess your old man
is just a guy who's
stuck in his ways.

40:39.813 --> 40:40.813
But hey...

40:42.482 --> 40:44.441
If you can't do
anything about it,

40:44.901 --> 40:46.527
don't worry about it.

41:13.930 --> 41:14.888
Hey.

41:15.056 --> 41:16.140
Hey.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.725
Listen,

41:19.602 --> 41:20.602
I know it's been
on your mind

41:20.770 --> 41:23.480
and I think you'd be
a really great addition
to squad.

41:27.277 --> 41:28.777
You're gonna want to
take Hazmat Tech A,

41:28.945 --> 41:31.405
Vertical Rescue and
Building Collapse One.

41:31.906 --> 41:34.074
If any of them are full,
you let me know.
I can...

41:34.826 --> 41:36.368
I can pull some strings.

41:36.536 --> 41:37.995
Really?
Really.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.831
Let's push it,
see what happens.

41:41.833 --> 41:42.916
Okay.

41:43.668 --> 41:44.877
Great.
