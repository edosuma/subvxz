WEBVTT

00:04.755 --> 00:06.923
I ought to
have this framed.

00:07.049 --> 00:09.884
My last bill from Princeton.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.470
And I thought
we were celebrating

00:12.596 --> 00:14.263
the fact
that I actually graduated.

00:14.390 --> 00:15.890
I always knew
you'd be able to graduate.

00:16.016 --> 00:20.269
What I didn't know
was whether I would
be able to pay for it.

00:20.396 --> 00:23.898
Your mom,
she'd be so proud of you.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.901
You always say that.

00:27.027 --> 00:30.029
I'm so proud of you.
Always was.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.451
Come on, Dad,
you're gonna cry.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.163
You wanna be embarrassed?
You got it!

00:48.215 --> 00:50.466
Look, don't party
too hard tonight.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.885
Your grandmother
wants a picture of you
getting that sheepskin,

00:53.011 --> 00:55.221
and it'd be nice
if you didn't look
completely hung over.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.639
Oh, no, don't worry,

00:56.765 --> 00:58.391
I've had enough alcohol
in the past week

00:58.517 --> 01:02.019
- to last me another four years.
- Good, I think.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.906
Drink! Drink! Drink!

01:14.032 --> 01:17.326
More! More!
Drink! Drink! Drink!

01:23.041 --> 01:24.834
12:55!

01:27.463 --> 01:28.671
Man!

01:29.798 --> 01:33.050
- You are the man!
- Tell me something I don't know!

01:36.013 --> 01:37.889
- Hey, that's not funny, man.
- What?

01:38.015 --> 01:41.017
- Yeah, right, you shocked me.
- With what? I got nothing.

01:46.064 --> 01:48.775
Well, hey, whoever's
doing that better cut it out!

01:55.657 --> 01:57.283
What the hell's going on?

01:57.409 --> 01:59.827
Maybe
there's a short somewhere,
the floor's covered with beer.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.953
No way, no,
the outlets are GFI,

02:01.079 --> 02:02.663
plus he's got
rubber-soled shoes on.

02:04.416 --> 02:07.043
- Oh, my God!
- Somebody call 911!

02:50.671 --> 02:53.464
Patient experiences
shock-like sensations

02:53.590 --> 02:57.718
as well as headaches, nausea,
and drowsiness.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.136
Shocks?

02:59.263 --> 03:01.138
Excruciatingly
painful shocks.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.140
ER docs referred him
to a neurologist,

03:03.267 --> 03:05.643
who referred him
to five other doctors
in the last seven days.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.354
Shocks could be
Lhermitte's sign.
Early symptom of MS.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.648
No. MRI showed
no white matter lesions,

03:10.774 --> 03:13.150
and the shocks aren't
accompanied by neck flexing.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.319
- Good morning!
- It's almost noon.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.613
Really? That must be
why I'm so hungry.

03:17.739 --> 03:18.781
Who's up for lunch?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.199
What's with the jacket?

03:20.325 --> 03:23.870
It keeps me warm and cool.
How does it know?

03:23.996 --> 03:25.288
We're discussing
your new patient.

03:25.414 --> 03:28.124
Must be a boring discussion,
seeing as I haven't accepted
a new patient.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.419
You accepted him the moment
I loaned you 5 grand.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.045
Oh, wait, wait.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.715
When I said I'd do anything for the
money, obviously I didn't mean it.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.551
You're gonna like this.
The kid's getting shocked
every few minutes.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.136
Why would you need $5,000?

03:40.262 --> 03:43.139
Bad night at poker,
or great night with a hooker?

03:43.265 --> 03:44.640
Thank you for saving me
the trouble

03:44.766 --> 03:48.227
of deflecting that
personal question
with a joke.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.146
College student?

03:50.272 --> 03:52.148
Nitrous oxide's
fun at parties.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.483
Caused the shocks, and drinking
till we puke every night

03:54.610 --> 03:55.693
can cause everything else.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.236
- Give him some B12.
- Been there, done that.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.364
Also ruled out cancer,
MS, pyridoxine toxicity,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.617
and all the popular
neuropathies.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.162
- Cervical spondylosis.
- Doesn't explain the low white count.

04:06.288 --> 04:07.622
He's black.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.750
I'm assuming
he's not just really dirty,
but is of African descent,

04:10.876 --> 04:12.209
which means he'd have
a lower white count.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.545
- Not this low.
- He's a wrestler.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.839
Probably uses diuretics
to cut weight.

04:16.965 --> 04:17.965
That can also cause
low white count.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.884
Not this low.
"Not this low."

04:20.010 --> 04:21.510
Behcet's.
No skin lesions.

04:21.637 --> 04:24.931
- Cervical herpes zoster, myelitis...
- No external outbreak.

04:27.893 --> 04:31.103
Something's missing.
Find out what it is.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.190
- I don't even know what that means.
- Well, figure it out.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.234
Find it out, and then find me.
I'll be at lunch.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.821
- No ideas?
- Lots of ideas.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.282
Too many ideas,
that's why so many tests.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.494
Have you used
any recreational drugs?

04:49.581 --> 04:53.042
What? I'm gonna get
mad at you for getting stoned?

04:53.168 --> 04:54.877
Not today, not here.

04:57.965 --> 05:01.133
At Christmas,
one of the guys
had some ecstasy,

05:01.259 --> 05:02.134
I mean, I... It was...

05:07.265 --> 05:08.933
Son of a bitch!

05:14.398 --> 05:16.941
ANA is negative for lupus,
again.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.695
House wants more information, not the
same information done over again.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.862
"Find what's missing."

05:21.989 --> 05:24.448
For all we know, the kid is dying
and he's giving us riddles?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.993
Did a more detailed history,
went back three generations.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.703
- And?
- His mom died in a car accident,

05:28.829 --> 05:30.871
his mom's mom had arthritis,
and his mom's mom's dad

05:30.998 --> 05:33.374
served in an all-black
tank battalion under Patton.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.085
Fascinating.
If it's not a tumor,
it has to be MS.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.128
Wilson already ruled out...

05:37.254 --> 05:39.588
MRI can't rule out
MS 100% of the time.

05:39.715 --> 05:42.842
- Doesn't explain the low white count.
- Alcoholism does.

05:42.968 --> 05:46.387
On admission,
his BAC was 2.0,
liver enzymes off the chart.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.390
It was graduation weekend.
He barely drank
in the weeks before that,

05:49.516 --> 05:51.892
and he didn't drink at all
during his wrestling season.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.936
- If you believe him.
- I did a tox screen...

05:54.062 --> 05:56.814
It doesn't matter
if she believes him or not,
it's already in the chart.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.400
We're supposed to find out
what's missing.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.702
Well, this...
This is perfect.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.121
Invite me to dinner
on Thursday night.

06:12.247 --> 06:15.124
Come on, we haven't had
a nice meal together since...

06:15.250 --> 06:18.836
Yesterday, when I loaned you
$5,000 to buy a new car.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.254
My treat.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.134
Two-wheeled vehicles
that travel 150 miles an hour

06:25.260 --> 06:28.387
don't really go well with crippled,
irresponsible drug addicts.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.349
Actually, two-wheeled vehicles that go
180 miles an hour do not go well

06:32.476 --> 06:34.435
with healthy,
responsible architects

06:34.561 --> 06:36.645
who don't know how to
separate braking and turning.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.148
Good news is, it brings
the price right down.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.942
- You're taking it back.
- Mom!

06:42.736 --> 06:44.487
How about we talk
about this over dinner?

06:44.613 --> 06:46.614
Forget dinner,
you're gonna kill yourself!

06:46.740 --> 06:49.283
- Nice bike!
- Thank you.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.496
See, that's how you do it.
Compliments, dinner.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.498
What do you do
with your cane?

06:55.624 --> 06:57.458
If he buys me dinner,
he'll find out.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.131
Evel Knievel
had the same setup.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.966
And he broke every bone
in his body.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.386
We went through
all the imaging studies
and redid the blood cultures.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.139
I don't want hand-me-downs,
I want brand-new stuff.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.476
Well, there's nothing...
There's nothing missing!

07:15.602 --> 07:18.270
Sorry, I didn't
catch that last part!

07:19.314 --> 07:21.816
There's... There's...

07:27.280 --> 07:29.156
There's nothing else
we can do.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.242
- Did you check the police report?
- On what?

07:31.368 --> 07:32.827
On his mom's car accident.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.162
That was 15 years ago.
The kid wasn't even
in the car.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.873
She veered off a straight,
dry road in broad daylight.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.041
That doesn't seem odd to you?

07:39.167 --> 07:41.710
She probably got distracted
changing radio stations
or something.

07:41.837 --> 07:43.003
That's what
the police thought.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.131
Of course, they didn't know
that she has a family member

07:45.257 --> 07:48.134
who is
frequently incapacitated
by shock-like sensations.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.345
- A genetic component seems unlikely.
- But it's interesting.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.848
Type II neurofibromatosis
could cause the shocks.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.266
You knew this was missing?

07:55.392 --> 07:58.144
I knew something was missing,
maybe this,
maybe something else.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.438
Get a DNA analysis
of the long arm
of chromosome 22.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.028
You'd rather have dinner with your wife?

08:08.155 --> 08:11.740
Yes, I would.
If she were speaking to me.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.536
Unlike her,
I could make it
worth your while.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.497
Fine.

08:19.291 --> 08:20.749
Shall I drive?

08:21.877 --> 08:23.169
No.

08:23.295 --> 08:26.547
And I'm not
letting you in my car
until I see your wallet.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.594
NF2.
It's an inherited disease.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.139
It could cause
abnormal growths
on the cranial nerves.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.016
It would explain the shocks
and other symptoms.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.059
DNA analysis will show
whether your son

08:39.186 --> 08:40.936
has the specific
chromosome mutation

08:41.062 --> 08:42.146
which causes the disease.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.232
But if it's inherited,
that means someone else
in our family would have it.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.942
We think your wife
may have had it.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.445
No. She never had
any sort of health problems.

08:49.571 --> 08:52.031
No odd-looking freckles,
nodules in the iris?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.241
Nothing. I mean,
why would you think
she was sick?

08:54.367 --> 08:57.494
We think it may have been
what caused her car accident.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.247
Wait, what do you mean?
My mom's car was hit
by a drunk driver.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.125
That's not what
the police report indicated.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.254
Well, you must have gotten
the wrong report.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.715
No. They didn't.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.225
When you started driving...

09:19.351 --> 09:20.351
I...

09:22.187 --> 09:23.938
You lied about how Mom died?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.273
I figured if her death
could somehow mean something,
it...

09:26.399 --> 09:29.235
How does lying about it
mean something?

09:29.361 --> 09:31.820
How could you use her
like that, Dad? Her death?

09:31.947 --> 09:35.032
- I was just trying to protect you.
- What else isn't true?

09:35.158 --> 09:37.243
She wasn't a teacher,
you just wanted me to read?

09:37.369 --> 09:38.744
What's that smell?

09:39.371 --> 09:41.372
I don't smell...

09:46.044 --> 09:47.127
We're gonna need a nurse.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.589
- What the hell?
- It's okay. We'll take care of it.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.258
You didn't feel anything?

09:52.384 --> 09:53.384
No.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.055
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.890
But you didn't feel
any of this?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.016
No.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.364
Sphincter paralysis
plus shocks equals
Miller Fisher Syndrome.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.865
Not if you add
the stool sample,

10:16.992 --> 10:18.242
which is negative
for C. jejuni.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.495
He lied to his son
about how his mom died?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.247
He was just
protecting him.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.707
Manipulating him.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.418
- That's what parents do.
- They lie to us because they love us.

10:27.544 --> 10:28.752
Who's getting teary?

10:28.878 --> 10:30.254
Mom's death is irrelevant.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.089
DNA revealed no NF2 markers

10:32.215 --> 10:33.632
or any other
inherited disease.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.343
Apparently, she really did
fall asleep at the wheel.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.138
So, what exactly
are we talking about here?

10:39.264 --> 10:43.100
A little peeker,
or did the prairie dog
actually come out to play?

10:43.226 --> 10:45.561
- Excuse me?
- Are we talking explosive?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.856
The hemoccult
was negative for blood,

10:48.982 --> 10:53.861
and I wouldn't say
he actually exploded.
More like gushed?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.071
Good, then we're
getting somewhere.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.239
Yeah? Where?

10:57.365 --> 10:59.241
I have no idea.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.367
- Of course.
- Hello?

11:00.493 --> 11:02.828
- Love the riddles.
- Hi, Mom.

11:02.954 --> 11:06.874
Look, I have a business
dinner on Thursday night.
I can't get out of it.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.377
I know, I really
wanted to see you, too.

11:12.380 --> 11:15.257
Actually, can I call you back?
I'm in a meeting right now.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.759
Okay, thanks.

11:18.636 --> 11:19.720
Who was that?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.263
Angelina Jolie.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.558
I call her "Mom".
Who thinks that's sexy?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.685
So, explosive or gushing...

11:26.811 --> 11:29.021
She never calls here,
is everything okay?

11:30.440 --> 11:32.274
Great, yeah.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.360
My dad's taking her to Europe.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.904
They got a nine-hour layover
in Newark on Thursday.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.282
- If it's gastrointestinal...
- You lied to avoid seeing your own mom.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.660
Are you kidding?
I can't lie to my mom.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.162
Seriously, I can't.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.497
Wilson's invited me to dinner.

11:46.623 --> 11:49.166
It'd be rude to stand up a guy
who just loaned me 5 grand.

11:49.292 --> 11:51.085
Transverse myelitis.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.420
Could cause numbness,
anal sphincter dysfunction,

11:53.546 --> 11:54.546
and the shocks.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.299
Thank you for taking
no interest in my mother.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.801
But that begs the question,

11:58.927 --> 12:01.178
what caused
the transverse myelitis?

12:01.304 --> 12:03.555
Well, we've ruled out
cancer and MS.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.848
Leaves infection.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.350
If there was infection,
there'd be a fever.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.310
And his blood and CSF cultures
are all negative.

12:08.436 --> 12:11.688
Maybe the infection's gone
but the memory remains.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.274
Molecular mimicry.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.776
Nice.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.405
Okay,
get an immunoglobulin level
and electrophoresis.

12:23.368 --> 12:26.870
You're good, my friend.
I'm sure we'll meet again.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.249
Do you really think
that was his mom on the phone?

12:30.375 --> 12:33.168
Probably, don't know
why he'd lie about that.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.253
Who cares?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.880
You're not
the least bit curious
what his parents are like?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.257
I'm sure his mom's
a piece of work.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.134
Only a mother
could do that much damage.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.885
My bet's he was born
the way he is.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.263
Probably
tormented his parents,
not the other way around.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.765
Yeah, he was
either a fast runner
or one hell of a fighter.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.809
Where are you going?

12:48.935 --> 12:51.270
You guys can handle
the tests, right?

12:57.402 --> 13:00.654
Is there something important
that you and House need
to discuss over dinner?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.573
Other than
the skyrocketing

13:02.699 --> 13:04.491
interest rates
on personal loans?

13:04.617 --> 13:07.286
You know,
this is the fourth time
I've loaned him money.

13:07.412 --> 13:09.496
Not lunch money, money-money.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.706
House's parents.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.876
They have a layover
in Newark Thursday evening.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.006
- I'm canceling dinner.
- No.

13:20.383 --> 13:23.719
I thought maybe
you could just invite
a few more people.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.180
An infectious agent's
molecular structure

13:26.306 --> 13:27.848
can resemble
the spinal cord's.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.850
And when the immune system
attacks the infection,

13:29.976 --> 13:32.519
it ends up attacking
the spinal cord's as well.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.271
So he has an infection?

13:34.397 --> 13:35.355
They just said I don't.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.275
Even after
the infection is gone,
it goes right on attacking

13:38.401 --> 13:39.526
because the spinal cord
is still there.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.652
Is there a treatment?

13:40.778 --> 13:42.946
Depends on what
the original infection was.

13:43.072 --> 13:43.947
All right, you're done.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.451
You need to lay flat
after a lumbar puncture
for about an hour.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.495
I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.080
Hey, Dad, can you get me
a Coke, please?

13:52.207 --> 13:54.208
Yeah, that usually helps.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.127
You're done.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.463
If you're nauseous...

13:59.589 --> 14:02.257
No, I'm not nauseous.
I just want him out of here.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.093
He's your dad.
He's gonna be around.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.428
Yeah, I know.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.389
It's not that, it's...

14:10.683 --> 14:12.976
Are these people
completely incapable

14:13.102 --> 14:14.269
of telling the truth
to each other?

14:14.395 --> 14:16.855
He went to Jamaica
with his friends.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.273
No wonder he lied.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.442
Children aren't supposed
to have good times.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.319
One of his friends
flew them down.

14:22.445 --> 14:25.572
Carnell's dad has this thing
about him accepting stuff
from rich friends.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.742
He wants him to
remember who he is,
where he came from.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.993
Where have you been?

14:30.119 --> 14:32.538
Making dinner plans.
What's up?

14:32.664 --> 14:34.831
The boys have uncovered
the shocking fact

14:34.958 --> 14:37.918
that the patient has
a crappy relationship
with his dad.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.128
- They seem to actually care.
- Well, I don't.

14:40.255 --> 14:42.548
There's only one reason
any kid with a plane
flies to Jamaica.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.092
It wasn't for marijuana.
He doesn't do anything
but drink.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.385
He said that to you
or his pops?

14:46.511 --> 14:48.554
Tox screen was negative
for THC.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.139
Spring break was over
a month ago.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.391
Even pot would have
washed out by now.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.934
Even if he'd smoked,

14:54.060 --> 14:56.395
no way marijuana
causes transverse myelitis.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.606
True. But the stuff
they put on it does.

14:59.732 --> 15:00.816
Pesticides.

15:00.942 --> 15:04.027
Well, why would he
come clean about the trip
but lie about smoking pot?

15:04.153 --> 15:06.655
He wouldn't
necessarily have to smoke
to get pesticide poisoning.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.657
He could have eaten fruit
that'd been sprayed,

15:08.783 --> 15:10.826
or been exposed
through his skin on a hike.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.453
Or he could have smoked it.
A lot of it.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.248
Then lied about it
because that's what
this family does.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.584
Start him on IV pralidoxime.
Two grams per liter,

15:18.710 --> 15:21.420
and then one gram
every eight hours until
you see some improvement.

15:21.546 --> 15:24.298
You have no evidence
to support
a poisoning diagnosis.

15:24.424 --> 15:28.010
Which is why
it's gonna be so cool
when I turn out to be right.

15:30.638 --> 15:31.930
Cameron.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.100
Who are you making
dinner plans with?

15:35.226 --> 15:36.310
No one.

15:41.399 --> 15:42.816
You bastard.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.404
You invited my parents
to dinner.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.365
Cameron's got a big mouth.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.533
Not as big as yours.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.745
Hey! You used me
to avoid seeing your parents.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.079
- Well, what do you care?
- I don't.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.206
I just thought
it might be interesting
to find out why.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.876
- You could've just asked.
- You would've lied.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.544
And you would've believed me.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.379
Which would've kept us
both happy.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.258
You want your money back?
Is that what this is about?

16:08.384 --> 16:09.426
No!

16:10.470 --> 16:13.305
Wait, have you got the money?

16:18.269 --> 16:20.562
If you have the money,
then why did you need
the loan?

16:20.688 --> 16:23.148
I didn't.
I just wanted to see
if you'd give it to me.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.067
I've been borrowing
increasing amounts

16:25.193 --> 16:27.527
ever since you lent me
$40 a year ago.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.737
A little experiment,

16:28.863 --> 16:30.781
to see
where you draw the line.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.952
You're trying
to objectively measure

16:36.079 --> 16:38.205
how much
I value our friendship?

16:38.331 --> 16:40.957
Hey, it's 5 grand.
You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

16:41.084 --> 16:45.170
So, what do you say?
One little phone call,
one big check?

16:47.465 --> 16:48.590
Fine.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.426
Thanks.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.095
Now, be a grownup

16:53.221 --> 16:55.263
and either
tell Mommy and Daddy
you don't wanna see them,

16:55.390 --> 16:58.058
or I'm picking you up
at 7:00 for dinner.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.143
What do you mean?
You just said that...

17:00.269 --> 17:01.645
I lied.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.855
I've been lying to you
in increasing amounts

17:03.981 --> 17:06.983
ever since I told you
you looked good unshaved
a year ago.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.652
It's a little experiment,
you know,

17:08.778 --> 17:10.529
to see
where you draw the line.

17:16.119 --> 17:16.993
How's the patient?

17:17.120 --> 17:18.620
Haven't been in yet, today.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.123
As long as he hasn't gotten
any worse.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.000
We're treating him
for pesticide poisoning

17:24.127 --> 17:25.961
without any proof
of pesticides.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.129
I'm gonna have
a hell of a time

17:27.255 --> 17:28.755
explaining that
to our lawyer.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.924
I told House not to...

17:34.470 --> 17:35.595
Wow.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.390
Lawyer's not gonna
believe this.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.017
He's got his appetite back.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.145
Whatever you did,
it's working.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.398
He's healthy,
so all is forgiven.

17:46.524 --> 17:47.983
Now I'm feeling nauseous.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.735
He is not healthy.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.987
Nausea and diarrhea
were not his only symptoms.

17:52.113 --> 17:53.447
The shocks
have also decreased.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.990
But not disappeared.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.074
And he's out of the diaper,

17:56.200 --> 17:57.492
which is good news
for everyone.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.286
What about
his low white count?

17:59.412 --> 18:02.539
Well, the little buggers
need time to grow.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.667
Don't worry,
our wrestling Rastafarian
will be back on his feet

18:05.793 --> 18:08.795
and sneaking around
behind Pop's back again
in no time.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.256
Yeah.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.135
Check it again.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.430
I'll be right there.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.931
What happened?

18:20.057 --> 18:21.183
Apparently I can save money

18:21.309 --> 18:24.019
by switching to another
long-distance carrier.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.312
Oh, I was right, wasn't I?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.148
Oh, yeah, it's always
about you, isn't it?

18:29.150 --> 18:31.026
He has the chills
and his temperature's spiking.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.028
- It's nearly 106.
- What's that mean?

18:33.154 --> 18:34.613
I mean, what's happening?

18:34.739 --> 18:35.906
You want the truth,

18:36.032 --> 18:37.991
or you want me to make
something up to protect you?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.993
We think a drunk driver
broke into his room...

18:40.119 --> 18:41.953
What's happening to my son?

18:44.165 --> 18:46.750
The truth is I have no idea.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.179
There's the fever
that Cameron was looking for.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.515
We knew if it was myelitis,
there had to be an "-itis".

19:01.641 --> 19:03.433
This must be the infection
that set it off.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.645
Yeah. Except in this universe,
effect follows cause.

19:06.771 --> 19:07.938
I've complained about it,
but...

19:08.064 --> 19:09.022
Maybe the tests were wrong.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.317
No. The tests were right.
Yesterday he had no fever,
no infection.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.736
So he just happened
to catch a bug
while he was here?

19:14.862 --> 19:15.862
That's all this is?

19:15.988 --> 19:16.863
Yeah.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.282
Because his white blood cell
count was down,
he was vulnerable.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.744
Because it's really down,
it might kill him.
That's all this is.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.538
Is he still pooping his pants?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.039
It just started again.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.123
Again?

19:27.250 --> 19:29.125
It stopped
when he was getting better.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.213
When he was feeling better.
He was never getting better.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.758
So, all we have to answer is,
what causes a 22-year-old kid

19:36.884 --> 19:38.218
to become immunocompromised

19:38.344 --> 19:40.011
with GI involvement
and shocks?

19:40.137 --> 19:41.930
Just stop and start
for no apparent reason.

19:42.056 --> 19:43.014
And we need
to find an answer

19:43.140 --> 19:44.391
before this infection
kills him.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.393
That would be the ideal.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.812
You. Intravenous
broad spectrum antibiotics.

19:48.938 --> 19:52.691
You get a cervical, thoracic,
and lumbar T2-weighted
fast spin-echo MRI.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.861
And you, track down
all those Richie Rich's
who went to Jamaica,

19:55.987 --> 19:59.322
see if any of them
have got the shocks,
the trots or the hots.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.200
The hots, it's the fever.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.955
You guys gonna join us
for dinner Thursday?

20:07.081 --> 20:08.623
Gotta do my laundry.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.417
You're not curious?

20:10.543 --> 20:13.712
I'm curious about crocs,
but I don't stick my head
in their mouths.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.464
I'm out, too.
Look, House is a freak!

20:16.591 --> 20:19.259
There's no virus
that causes that,
no DNA mutation.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.011
You're gonna have
one dinner with two people.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.097
Sixty minutes,
most of it spent chewing
or talking about the weather.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.682
Unless they say
something like,

20:25.808 --> 20:27.684
"Do you prefer
the chardonnay
or the merlot?"

20:27.810 --> 20:30.437
and, "Oh, we kept Greg
locked in a closet
for 17 years".

20:30.563 --> 20:32.105
You're not gonna
learn anything.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.648
Okay.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.692
We'd like to talk
to some of your friends,

20:35.818 --> 20:37.402
see if they have
any similar symptoms.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.988
The doctors in the ER
already asked me that.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.031
We understand,

20:41.157 --> 20:43.366
but they didn't have
all the information
that we have now.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.160
What kind of information?

20:47.705 --> 20:50.999
Would you mind
if I spoke with Carnell
alone for a minute?

20:52.001 --> 20:53.043
Is this bad news?

20:53.169 --> 20:55.128
No. It's just confidential.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.506
Why is something
suddenly confidential?

20:58.633 --> 21:00.550
I mean, if you know
something about my son,

21:00.676 --> 21:02.010
I need to know
what's going on.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.512
I'm sorry, I have to insist.

21:04.639 --> 21:06.014
I'm his father,

21:06.140 --> 21:08.600
and if I'm going
to take care of him,
I need to know the truth.

21:08.726 --> 21:09.851
Dad.

21:11.604 --> 21:14.397
She wants to know
who I went to Jamaica with.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.024
You've never been
to Jamaica.

21:16.150 --> 21:19.152
Taddy's dad flew
a bunch of us down
over spring break.

21:22.156 --> 21:25.200
You told me you had
two papers to write
over the break.

21:25.326 --> 21:29.037
'Cause I didn't
want to come home
and work my ass off.

21:29.163 --> 21:32.374
I wanted an actual break
during a break for once.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.045
I shouldn't have lied to you.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.464
No, what you should have done
is come home

21:39.590 --> 21:42.008
instead of partying
with your rich friends.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.302
I'm sorry,
we need those names.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.393
What do you want?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.478
To apologize.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.399
I realize that
my attention to the clinic
has been somewhat lax of late,

21:57.525 --> 21:59.651
and I wanna make amends.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.028
How about tomorrow night?
I take the night shift.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.738
The clinic's closed at night.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.366
Yeah, but I'm sure
there's plenty of things
to be done,

22:06.492 --> 22:09.035
there's charts to be reviewed,
supplies inventoried...

22:09.161 --> 22:11.037
Dinners avoided.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.038
You're going, too?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.748
I love their Cobb Salad.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.043
Give me a reason
to get out of this,

22:17.169 --> 22:18.878
and I'll tell you
who started the rumor

22:19.005 --> 22:21.339
about you
being a transsexual.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.383
- There is no such rumor.
- There will be,

22:23.509 --> 22:25.093
unless you get me
out of this dinner.

22:25.219 --> 22:26.761
No one's making you
do this, House.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.263
Just do what
everybody else does.

22:28.389 --> 22:29.514
Lie to them.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.765
You lie to your mother?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.142
Only since I was 12!

22:32.268 --> 22:34.436
My mom's a human polygraph.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.938
My dad should be
taking her to Vegas,
not the Louvre.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.441
Trust me, your mom
would much rather think

22:39.567 --> 22:42.318
you have a business meeting
than you hate her.

22:42.445 --> 22:45.238
I don't hate her.
I hate him.

22:47.450 --> 22:50.618
We all had headaches,
nausea, vomiting.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.078
You know,
we figured it was connected

22:52.204 --> 22:54.039
to the massive amounts
of drinking.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.041
What, you think
what happened to Carnell

22:56.167 --> 22:57.042
has something
to do with the trip?

22:57.168 --> 22:58.293
Don't know.

22:58.419 --> 23:00.045
You haven't had
any unexplained pain

23:00.171 --> 23:01.546
or strange feelings
since you got back?

23:01.672 --> 23:04.632
No, except for a little
athlete's foot, I'm fine.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.176
Can I see it?

23:06.927 --> 23:08.428
- See what?
- Your feet.

23:08.554 --> 23:12.057
There's a common parasite
in Jamaica

23:12.183 --> 23:14.476
that can resemble
foot fungus.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.687
It's not really my feet.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.899
You know,
I figured fungus is fungus.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.985
It's my groin.

23:25.738 --> 23:28.031
I'm going to need
to take a look at that.

23:28.157 --> 23:29.032
Now?

23:29.158 --> 23:31.034
Unless you wanna come down
to the hospital with me.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.036
No, no, I can't. I mean,
I just started two days ago.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.829
We're right in the middle
of a big merger...

23:34.955 --> 23:36.372
Then drop your pants.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.849
Reilly, I need the...
What the hell's going on here?

23:54.975 --> 23:55.975
She's a doctor.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.061
I'm a doctor,
he has a rash,
and a friend of his is...

23:58.187 --> 24:00.897
Right. Well, as soon as
she's done treating your rash,

24:01.023 --> 24:02.273
I need the numbers
on D-Port Technology.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.566
Yes, sir.

24:03.692 --> 24:07.195
And, Doctor,
why don't you leave
a card on your way out?

24:15.371 --> 24:17.038
Except for one guy
with a rash,

24:17.164 --> 24:19.124
no one else on the trip
has any health issues.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.250
What kind of rash?

24:20.376 --> 24:22.001
I don't know,
I took some scrapings,

24:22.128 --> 24:23.586
it doesn't
appear to be ringworm.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.464
What did it look like,
aside from "not ringworm"?

24:26.590 --> 24:28.049
Basically like diaper rash.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.342
He's been working
around the clock,

24:29.468 --> 24:31.427
he said he hasn't changed
his clothes in three days.

24:31.554 --> 24:33.346
Kaposi's Sarcoma
can look like diaper rash.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.056
Any discoloration
around the edges?

24:35.182 --> 24:37.058
Get him in here.
We all wanna take a look.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.185
Even if it is Kaposi's,
it's not related.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.812
Our patient doesn't
have any skin symptoms

24:40.938 --> 24:42.313
and we've already
ruled out cancer.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.065
What are the odds
of two friends

24:44.191 --> 24:46.025
who just
returned from a trip
outside the country

24:46.152 --> 24:48.611
coming down with unexplained
but unrelated illnesses?

24:48.737 --> 24:50.029
- Get him in here.
- He won't come.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.573
Just started a new job
after graduation,

24:51.699 --> 24:53.032
they're working
on some big merger.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.993
Tell him his friend's life
hangs in the balance.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.870
That's what I told him
the first time.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.539
Still wound up
driving into Manhattan.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.916
Tell him his life
hangs in the balance.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.668
Tell him the rash
is flesh-eating,

25:03.794 --> 25:06.963
and the next
course on the menu
is his frank and beans.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.260
Where's Stacy?

25:12.386 --> 25:14.971
Speaking at a conference
in Baltimore.
Why, what do you need?

25:15.097 --> 25:16.097
Can I subpoena a patient?

25:16.223 --> 25:18.474
House wants me
to lie to the kid
to get him in here.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.602
Well, then you'll be the one
getting the subpoena.

25:20.728 --> 25:23.062
Well, we do need him
to diagnose his friend.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.355
Take the test to the kid.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.066
There is no test,
House just wants
to look at it.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.693
Then take House to it.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.403
Yeah,
like that's gonna happen.

25:32.323 --> 25:34.032
Tell House his parents called.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.742
Said they were
coming in early.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.161
He'll go anywhere
just to avoid them.

25:40.331 --> 25:43.666
So, it's okay to lie to House
but not to a patient?

25:43.792 --> 25:44.918
Yup.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.591
- What's wrong?
- His stomach's getting a lot worse.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.384
It's rigid!

25:58.098 --> 25:59.891
He's bleeding
into his abdomen!

26:00.017 --> 26:00.975
What's going on?

26:01.101 --> 26:03.978
- We need a surgeon and an OR, stat!
- On it.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.106
Try to hang in there, Carnell.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.952
The infection
caused a perforation
in his sigmoid colon.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.119
It's repairable.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.121
But it means
the antibiotics
aren't working.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.624
Double the dose,
and add Tygacil to the list.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.042
Soon as he's out of surgery.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.418
Where's Richie Rich?

26:27.544 --> 26:29.379
He said he can't leave work.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.339
Yeah, you told me that
two hours ago.

26:31.465 --> 26:32.924
I'm not gonna lie.

26:33.050 --> 26:35.969
Why, 'cause it's wrong?
Or because you're a coward?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.178
Tough choice.

26:37.304 --> 26:40.098
You'd be wasting two hours
of the kid's time.

26:40.224 --> 26:43.142
Is that deeply
and unforgivably
morally wrong? No.

26:43.269 --> 26:46.688
Because it's not
a waste of his time.
Unless we're wrong.

26:46.814 --> 26:50.275
Unless his condition's
got nothing to do
with his friend's.

26:50.401 --> 26:52.944
You're just afraid
of being wrong.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.366
Your parents called.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.704
- They had to catch an earlier...
- You don't have to lie to him.

27:02.830 --> 27:03.830
Kid's on his way here.

27:03.956 --> 27:04.956
He got off work?

27:05.082 --> 27:09.085
Yeah, by vomiting blood.
Ambulance is 10 minutes out.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.136
- You Taddy?
- Why?

27:18.846 --> 27:21.055
Love the name.
If I ever had a dog.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.307
Take off his pants.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.433
Hey.

27:23.559 --> 27:24.976
Don't talk to her,
listen to me.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.978
He's vomited in excess
of three units of blood.

27:27.104 --> 27:29.147
- He needs to be admitted before...
- If you wanted to be a doctor,

27:29.273 --> 27:31.774
maybe you should
have buckled down
a little more in high school.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.067
- Bite me.
- What are you doing?

27:33.193 --> 27:34.986
Exactly how close
were you and Carnell?

27:35.112 --> 27:35.987
Not so close.

27:36.113 --> 27:37.864
Spend a lot of time together
in Jamaica?

27:37.990 --> 27:38.990
Share a room?

27:39.116 --> 27:41.993
Wait, you don't think...
Look, we're not gay.

27:42.119 --> 27:45.246
- I'm not saying you're gay.
- I'm saying you had sex.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.290
Look, we're not gay.
We hardly even hung out.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.083
Right. Guess you just
flew him down to Jamaica

27:49.209 --> 27:50.209
'cause he won a contest.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.753
No, he's in my frat.

27:51.879 --> 27:53.171
All right,
between school and wrestling

27:53.297 --> 27:55.965
and going home
every break to work
in his father's junkyard,

27:56.091 --> 27:58.217
Carnell didn't have any time
to hang out with anybody.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.552
It's not fungus.

27:59.678 --> 28:00.970
I already
told you that.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.681
There's no pustules,
it's not staph.

28:06.435 --> 28:07.393
His dad's what?

28:07.519 --> 28:09.937
His dad owns a scrap metal
salvage yard.

28:10.064 --> 28:12.106
Carnell worked there
during breaks.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.655
You lied.

28:19.782 --> 28:20.990
What are you talking about?

28:21.116 --> 28:23.242
Oh, yeah, of course,
in this family,

28:23.369 --> 28:25.453
you probably
need more specifics.

28:25.579 --> 28:28.748
You told us you owned
a construction company,
not a salvage yard.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.166
I know the way things work.

28:30.292 --> 28:32.794
The better my job,
the better my son
gets treated.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.462
Right, that's why I'm mad,

28:34.588 --> 28:36.964
we wasted all that
filet mignon on you.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.801
Did your kid find anything
unusual the last time
he worked for you?

28:39.927 --> 28:40.927
No.

28:41.053 --> 28:41.969
Braided wire?

28:42.096 --> 28:44.555
Metal weights on each end,
a lead canister,
maybe just a lid.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.641
Probably used it as a doorstop
or a paperweight.

28:46.767 --> 28:48.309
Why would he wanna...

28:50.104 --> 28:52.146
Okay, here it comes.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.981
I gave him
an early graduation gift,

28:54.108 --> 28:56.401
an old plumb I found,
looks like a fishing weight.

28:56.527 --> 28:59.987
Put it on a keychain,
so he'd always remember
where he came from.

29:00.114 --> 29:01.989
So he could lie
about it later?

29:02.116 --> 29:04.867
- Where's the keychain?
- I don't know, he never used it.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.327
Just kept it
as a good luck charm.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.038
- Kept it where?
- I don't know.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.999
Why? Why does it matter?

29:13.127 --> 29:14.210
Where are the kid's clothes?

29:14.336 --> 29:16.129
In the bureau
back in his regular room.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.714
- You two, get it to radiology.
- His clothes?

29:18.841 --> 29:20.800
The bureau. Don't open it.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.510
You, come with me.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.892
Set it down there.

29:32.855 --> 29:35.565
Now get out of here,
this thing's radioactive.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.985
The chances of radiation
causing CNS symptoms?

29:43.157 --> 29:45.074
Whoa.

29:50.038 --> 29:52.582
Call the boys
in the lead pajamas.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.638
The radiation measurements
weren't high enough

30:07.764 --> 30:10.057
to cause central
nervous system damage.

30:10.184 --> 30:11.559
It mightn't have caused
nerve damage,

30:11.685 --> 30:13.769
but it definitely destroyed
his immune system.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.229
And caused tumors.

30:15.355 --> 30:18.733
We don't know that.
None of the MRIs
showed anything.

30:20.194 --> 30:23.446
Do a PET scan.
Check his cervical spine.

30:24.948 --> 30:26.991
It's not gonna be good news.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.747
Mr. Hall,
it's not good news.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.708
The piece of metal
you gave Carnell

30:35.834 --> 30:38.920
was from an industrial device
used to test wells.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.631
People aren't supposed to just
dump radioactive material.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.007
But they do.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.640
So, what now?
I mean, what do you do?

30:50.766 --> 30:52.767
Anyone who's had
contact with the source

30:52.893 --> 30:56.062
will have to immediately
get treatment
for radiation sickness.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.105
Taddy carried it
on his lap on the flight.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.982
So there is a treatment?

31:00.651 --> 31:02.318
Transfusions.

31:02.444 --> 31:05.446
And we try to get the fluids
and electrolytes balanced.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.739
Carnell,

31:08.325 --> 31:10.243
he's had much more exposure.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.496
The equivalent of about
70,000 chest X rays.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.917
His ability
to create white blood cells
has been completely destroyed.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.587
And that's why he can't
fight off this infection?

31:21.713 --> 31:24.674
Yeah. He's gonna need
a bone marrow transplant.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.720
And we did
another PET scan.

31:29.846 --> 31:33.975
There's a cavernous angioma
within his spinal cord,
it's a tumor.

31:34.101 --> 31:38.020
That's what's been causing
the shocks and CNS symptoms.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.607
He has a tumor
inside of his spinal cord?

31:42.734 --> 31:46.487
The cord is made of strands

31:46.613 --> 31:49.365
put together,
sort of like a kite string.

31:49.491 --> 31:54.036
The surgeon should be able
to pull the strands apart
and excise the tumor.

31:54.162 --> 31:58.749
But surgery on someone
who's as hemopoetically
compromised as your son

31:59.960 --> 32:01.669
is extremely risky.

32:11.638 --> 32:12.763
And,

32:14.975 --> 32:17.643
if you don't do the surgery?
I mean...

32:17.769 --> 32:20.771
The tumor could cause
his breathing to stop.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.232
Possibly his heart as well.

32:27.112 --> 32:29.739
There's no way
you could have known.

32:41.752 --> 32:43.502
Now, you're gonna
have to come with us.

32:43.629 --> 32:44.712
You need to start
treatment yourself.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.505
No. No, no.

32:47.758 --> 32:49.634
I can start
my treatment later.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.052
But he can't.

32:51.762 --> 32:55.848
He needs to be
in a sterile isolation room
to prevent further infections.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.774
- Mom.
- We're early.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.402
- It's great to see you.
- Oh, Greg, don't lie.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.366
We came at a bad time,
didn't we?

33:13.492 --> 33:17.370
Actually, yeah, I think
I have to take a rain check.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.373
Oh, plans have been made.
Wilson made them.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.458
I asked him to cancel.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.752
I'm dealing with a kind
of a complicated case
right now so...

33:24.878 --> 33:26.587
Well, we'll just come back

33:26.713 --> 33:28.756
when things aren't
so out of control.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.175
My team is busy.

33:31.301 --> 33:32.468
You don't wanna see us.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.053
Mom, don't make me
feel guilty.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.055
No, no, of course not.
Sorry.

33:36.181 --> 33:39.266
I've got a patient
who's probably gonna
die of radiation poisoning.

33:39.393 --> 33:41.560
So that means you can't eat?

33:43.063 --> 33:45.690
Come on,
let's grab a bite
in the cafeteria.

33:45.816 --> 33:47.566
I'll buy you a Reuben.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.655
Well, I guess
I got time for a sandwich.

33:52.781 --> 33:53.781
Good.

33:57.786 --> 33:58.661
Yeah?

33:58.787 --> 34:00.121
I just wanted
to let you know

34:00.247 --> 34:01.622
that Carnell's prepped
for surgery.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.124
Thank you.

34:04.751 --> 34:09.171
Hi, I'm Allison Cameron.
I work with your son.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.840
Greg's told us
all about you.

34:10.966 --> 34:11.966
Really?

34:13.677 --> 34:14.635
New, huh?

34:14.761 --> 34:16.220
Nope, just gullible.

34:16.346 --> 34:19.056
I'm sorry, I was just
making fun of my son,

34:19.182 --> 34:20.641
not of you.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.852
We were just about to go
to get something to eat,

34:22.978 --> 34:24.645
would you care to join us?

34:28.316 --> 34:30.651
You don't have
a lot of time with your son.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.778
Maybe another time.

34:41.997 --> 34:45.040
- Do you like the Beatles?
- They're all right.

34:46.334 --> 34:49.295
My 12-year-old
just turned me
back on to them.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.717
McCartney's gotta have
more money than God.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.929
I think that's all of it.
Reverse him.

35:00.056 --> 35:01.724
How's he doing?

35:03.059 --> 35:06.353
- Looks pretty good down here.
- Do I rock, or what?

35:07.314 --> 35:08.939
His pressure's dropping!

35:09.065 --> 35:10.941
- Give him another two units.
- I did already!

35:11.067 --> 35:12.818
His heart rate's falling.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.779
He's hemorrhaging.

35:22.871 --> 35:25.831
They're talking about Mom's
last trip to the dentist.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.667
Grown children
talking to their parents,

35:28.794 --> 35:30.377
nothing gets talked about.

35:30.504 --> 35:32.797
Trust me,
you're not missing anything.

35:34.716 --> 35:36.884
So, besides work,
what you been up to?

35:37.010 --> 35:38.052
Not much.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.679
You always say that,
"Not much".

35:41.306 --> 35:42.681
It's always the answer.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.309
Any new babes
you might wanna tell me about?

35:45.435 --> 35:47.311
Leave him alone, John.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.772
Got a new motorcycle.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.400
Might have seen it out front,

35:53.527 --> 35:55.694
it's orange
with a gigantic scrape.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.030
Is it the one
in the handicapped parking?

35:58.156 --> 35:59.240
Yeah.

35:59.991 --> 36:01.700
Looks like crap,
but it drives great.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.036
Well, you'll be careful,
right?

36:04.162 --> 36:06.664
Last I checked,
you still have two legs.

36:06.790 --> 36:08.040
Actually, three.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.960
You know what
your problem is, Greg?

36:11.086 --> 36:12.461
Shifting gears?

36:12.587 --> 36:15.130
You just don't know
how lucky you are.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.678
Where's the head?

36:27.769 --> 36:29.770
Well, good thing
we got that cleared up.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.897
Oh, he was just
trying to help.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.566
I don't need help.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.942
I know.

36:35.068 --> 36:38.153
You're absolutely perfect
just the way you are.

36:55.672 --> 36:56.755
Thank you.

37:02.804 --> 37:05.806
So, how much longer
do you think
he'll be in surgery?

37:05.932 --> 37:07.641
It's hard to say.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.655
You know, he just
started school when Ann died.

37:22.324 --> 37:23.699
I was a mess.

37:27.162 --> 37:30.623
Still adjusting
to being a parent,
much less a single parent.

37:32.208 --> 37:36.378
You know,
I used to put cold pancakes
in his lunch box.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.632
I mean,
that was the only thing

37:39.758 --> 37:41.592
I could make
that he would eat.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.429
- You did okay, he's a good kid.
- Yeah.

37:50.185 --> 37:53.312
Hey. So, how is he?

37:54.648 --> 37:57.316
Well, the surgeon
has removed the tumor

37:57.442 --> 37:59.485
without damaging
the spinal cord.

37:59.611 --> 38:02.154
But, the infection has caused

38:02.280 --> 38:04.490
another
intestinal perforation.

38:05.659 --> 38:06.617
We stopped the bleeding,

38:06.743 --> 38:08.744
but his white count
keeps falling.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.037
Okay.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.502
So what now? Another drug,
antibiotics, what?

38:19.214 --> 38:20.631
I'm sorry.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.968
The reality is,
no matter what we give him,

38:24.094 --> 38:27.888
it's unlikely
he's gonna be able
to fight off the infections.

38:52.956 --> 38:54.415
Okay, okay.

39:01.381 --> 39:04.091
The father and the friend
are responding well
to treatment.

39:04.217 --> 39:07.011
Things aren't looking
so good for Carnell.

39:08.388 --> 39:09.680
Thank you,

39:10.515 --> 39:11.974
for not eating.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.687
It was none of my business.

39:18.732 --> 39:20.983
They seem perfectly pleasant,
don't they?

39:21.693 --> 39:22.693
They are.

39:23.695 --> 39:26.780
He was a marine pilot.
She was a housewife.

39:27.782 --> 39:31.201
Married 47 years,
they had one child.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.663
Mom is just
like everyone else,

39:35.707 --> 39:37.249
she's nice enough,

39:37.375 --> 39:40.335
no great sense of humor,
hates confrontation.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.672
My dad's just like you.

39:44.424 --> 39:47.342
Not the caring
till your eyes
pop out part,

39:48.261 --> 39:50.054
just the insane moral compass

39:50.180 --> 39:52.556
that won't let you lie
to anybody about anything.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.558
It's a great quality
for Boy Scouts

39:54.684 --> 39:56.143
and police witnesses.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.147
Crappy quality for a dad.

40:15.288 --> 40:16.413
Hey.

40:17.499 --> 40:18.665
How you doing?

40:19.292 --> 40:20.709
I'm hanging in there.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.675
I'm sorry
I lied to you about Mom.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.805
I'm sorry I lied to you,
too.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.560
There was nothing good
that came out of her dying.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.020
I'm not mad.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.649
I know why you did it.

40:45.693 --> 40:46.902
It worked.

40:48.738 --> 40:50.697
I never drink and drive.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.705
I'm scared, Dad.

41:03.336 --> 41:04.670
Come on.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.674
There's nothing
to be scared of.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.176
You're gonna be just fine.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.469
Don't play me.

41:14.264 --> 41:16.140
I wanna know the truth.

41:17.517 --> 41:19.560
I'm telling you the truth.

41:21.062 --> 41:23.689
You're gonna be fine, I swear.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.322
I love you, Dad.

41:34.701 --> 41:36.410
I love you, too.

41:51.801 --> 41:54.928
Why does he hate
seeing his parents?

41:55.054 --> 41:58.724
So his dad tells the truth,
he can't handle that?

41:58.850 --> 42:01.351
He hates
being a disappointment.

42:01.477 --> 42:03.854
He's a doctor, world famous.

42:04.981 --> 42:07.274
How disappointed
can they be?

42:08.693 --> 42:10.068
You know what I figure
is worse

42:10.195 --> 42:12.446
than watching your son
become crippled?

42:13.448 --> 42:15.532
Watching him be miserable.
