02:14.540 --> 02:16.420
Come on. Get your coat.
We gotta go.

02:18.940 --> 02:22.180
- You have everything?
- Yeah.

02:22.340 --> 02:24.260
Hurry up, sweetie. We're late.

02:28.300 --> 02:31.500
Ty. Today, papi.

02:32.860 --> 02:35.460
You're killing me, Ty.
Right now, you're killing Mommy.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.900
- Okay, les go.
- Is not my fault, Mom.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.780
All right. You want to do
your speech for me?

02:43.940 --> 02:46.180
Ty! Hello? Thas better.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.380
You don't have to listen
to that 24 hours a day.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.340
Wait. Is Simon and Garfunkel.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.540
Thas why I tell you to tie your shoes.
I know. I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

02:53.700 --> 02:56.780
- You can't just turn them off, Mom.
- I understand, baby. Come on.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.060
- Careful of the puddle.
- Why'd they break up?

03:07.220 --> 03:09.220
- Who?
- Simon and Garfunkel.

03:09.420 --> 03:13.020
You got me.
You can Google it at school.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.780
Les go.

03:26.820 --> 03:29.300
Will I get in trouble
if I didn't give my speech?

03:29.460 --> 03:30.940
Because I'm not really feeling it.

03:31.100 --> 03:34.020
What do you mean? You've been
working all summer on that speech.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.500
- I can't wait to hear it.
- Is boring.

03:36.660 --> 03:40.100
Not to me or to abuela
or to your dad.

03:40.260 --> 03:42.260
I thought we were meeting him after.

03:42.420 --> 03:46.580
No way. He's coming, and then you
guys are going camping. Remember?

03:46.740 --> 03:49.340
He's gonna be late,
and then everyone will see.

03:51.780 --> 03:55.220
Look, he knows what time it starts.
Don't worry, he'll be there.

03:58.380 --> 04:00.300
- Hey, look at me.
- What?

04:00.460 --> 04:02.900
- You got something on your face there.
- Where?

04:03.060 --> 04:05.460
- Right there.
- Ma! Mom! Mom, no! Stop!

04:05.620 --> 04:07.620
There it is. I got it!

04:13.340 --> 04:16.339
- Hey, guys. How's it going?
- Hey, Ty.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.860
Whas up?
The speech thing is at 4:00.

04:20.019 --> 04:22.820
I know. Come here.
You got something on your face.

04:22.980 --> 04:24.500
- Mom!
- What?

04:24.660 --> 04:28.900
- Please.
- I'm sorry. Mr. Cool Guy.

04:30.180 --> 04:31.860
I love you.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.100
Have a good day.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.780
- Morning, Marisa.
- Whas up, Cora? How my diamonds?

05:31.940 --> 05:35.700
- They're hanging with your rubies.
- I like the sound of that.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.780
- Just made it, Marisa.
- I always do.

06:02.420 --> 06:06.220
- Good morning, Marisa.
- Whas up, Keef?

06:06.380 --> 06:10.260
How's the weather?
Sunshine. Thas nice.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.940
Anything good on?

06:16.140 --> 06:19.140
He opened the door for the paper.
The wife just pushed him out.

06:19.340 --> 06:22.540
That nasty butt first thing
in the morning, I'd kick him out too.

06:23.180 --> 06:26.100
Oh, my God. Wait a minute. He's
one of mine, the lactose intolerant.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.980
I like how you name the people.

06:28.140 --> 06:31.020
What do you call me
behind my back, I wonder.

06:32.380 --> 06:37.100
Yeah. Can I get a robe to the
Charles Suite ASAP? Thank you.

06:37.260 --> 06:40.100
I call you God because you see
everything and you still smile.

06:40.260 --> 06:45.140
- I'm cool with that. I surely am.
- I'll see you later, Keef.

06:48.420 --> 06:51.620
A Beresford maid is expedient.
A Beresford maid is thorough.

06:51.780 --> 06:53.700
A Beresford maid serves with a smile.

06:53.860 --> 06:56.940
And above all, a Beresford maid
strives to be invisible.

06:57.100 --> 07:00.300
Maybe we can disappear
one day altogether.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.100
You know what I just heard?

07:05.260 --> 07:08.140
Christina? History after the 1 st.

07:08.700 --> 07:10.740
Christina kitchen or
Christina assistant manager?

07:10.900 --> 07:12.820
Assistant manager.
You know what that means?

07:12.980 --> 07:15.340
Somebody else is gonna be
busting my ass on the 2nd.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.860
Wrong. It means we're gonna
need an assistant manager.

07:18.020 --> 07:22.780
- Yo, Barb, we still on for happy hour?
- Ten hours and counting.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.140
Hey, Marisa, you here?

07:24.300 --> 07:26.380
Can I finish getting dressed,
please? Thank you.

07:26.540 --> 07:28.900
You're the one who keeps
talking about being a manager.

07:29.060 --> 07:32.180
All I'm saying is, it could be you.

07:32.340 --> 07:34.060
They're not gonna make
a maid a manager.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.420
Why not? Today's a new day.
Anything's possible.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.300
You know what I'm saying?

07:47.900 --> 07:51.540
Friday morning, people!
Lots to do. Heads up.

07:52.140 --> 07:56.820
Mr. Bextrum has an announcement
to make. Mr. Bextrum.

07:56.980 --> 08:00.900
Christina Howarďs promotion created
a vacancy that we've decided to fill...

08:01.060 --> 08:03.700
...with in-house personnel.

08:03.860 --> 08:07.020
- Perhaps one of our butlers.
- Excuse me, Mr. Bextrum, sir?

08:07.180 --> 08:11.420
- Yes, Miss Kehoe?
- Can a maid apply?

08:11.580 --> 08:15.580
Technically, if an employee's been
here for three consecutive years...

08:15.740 --> 08:19.140
...he or, indeed, she,
is qualified to apply.

08:19.300 --> 08:23.620
So yes. Sure. Absolutely.
Why not? Anything is possible.

08:23.820 --> 08:26.700
You hear that?
The man said anything's possible.

08:26.860 --> 08:28.980
Yeah, I guess he did.

08:29.420 --> 08:31.580
On to new business.

08:31.820 --> 08:36.940
Mr. Radcliff is checking out of 709.
Mr. Greenwald is checking in.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.380
He's back on the wagon,
so les clear out the minibar.

08:40.659 --> 08:43.780
Kanga CFO, Mr. Fukimoro,
is checking into 814.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.860
Stock Evian, shampoo the rugs
and extra slippers for his guests.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.620
Marisa, heads up
on the Madison Suite.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.260
Housekeeping.

08:52.460 --> 08:54.540
Mrs. Sage is arriving
with the children...

08:54.700 --> 08:57.900
...preferably after Mr. Sage's
girlfriend departs.

08:58.060 --> 09:00.100
You son of a bitch!

09:00.260 --> 09:02.860
Les make sure is
a smooth transition.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.740
The Guedj sisters are back.
We'll track them on surveillance...

09:05.900 --> 09:09.700
...but do keep an eye on all
bathrobes, cutlery and light fixtures.

09:10.060 --> 09:13.420
Sotheby's director, Caroline Lane,
has switched from the Four Seasons.

09:13.580 --> 09:15.220
She requested a park view...

09:15.380 --> 09:18.940
...and favors purple orchids
and lavender scents.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.020
Assemblyman Chris Marshall
arrives today.

09:22.180 --> 09:23.540
He's gearing up his campaign...

09:23.700 --> 09:26.180
...so his suite will be doubling
as a conference center...

09:26.340 --> 09:29.860
...with the liquor and coffee bars
turning over every four hours.

09:30.020 --> 09:34.220
And he's bringing his large dog,
so we'll need proper accouterments.

09:34.380 --> 09:38.060
And finally, Mr. Newman is back
in the Sherman Suite.

09:38.220 --> 09:41.900
Careful, ladies, he's a full Monty.

09:44.620 --> 09:48.380
- I had no idea anyone was here.
- Don't worry about it, Mr. Monty.

09:48.540 --> 09:50.140
No big deal.

09:50.300 --> 09:54.140
- And I do mean no big deal.
- No big deal.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.540
Lavender!

10:03.180 --> 10:05.940
- You're very creative, Marisa.
- Thank you, ma'am.

10:06.180 --> 10:10.340
Since you have to leave at 3:00,
go find Lionel and have him sign off.

10:12.620 --> 10:16.780
- Sir, I need you to sign off on the...
- Damn!

10:16.940 --> 10:20.220
Oh, good Lord. Here, let me.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.860
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.300
Oh, God. Your hanďs bleeding.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.980
Here. Squeeze tight.

10:35.020 --> 10:38.660
Damn. He's checked in.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.580
Quote, "Sentimental favorite
Chris Marshall...

10:41.740 --> 10:42.740
...blah, blah, blah...

10:42.900 --> 10:45.540
...son of late Senator
Graham Marshall, blah, blah...

10:45.700 --> 10:48.740
...is expected to run for his father's
seat in the next election."

10:48.900 --> 10:51.300
- End quote.
- Let me see that. Let me see it, Jerry.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.340
You don't need to see it. No.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.420
- Give it here.
- Fine. But I hadn't finished it yet.

10:56.780 --> 10:59.380
"Sentimental favorite
and playboy politico...

10:59.540 --> 11:02.740
...Assemblyman Chris Marshall..."
Guess you missed a few words, Jer.

11:02.900 --> 11:04.420
What, "playboy"?
Thas a compliment.

11:04.620 --> 11:08.300
"Who called off his engagement
to? Ber babe Daniella Van Graas...

11:08.460 --> 11:11.540
...arrives in town solo."
Respectful, huh?

11:12.220 --> 11:15.700
Well, listen, you know, you're
a public figure. Is news. So what?

11:15.860 --> 11:18.060
We were never engaged.
Whose side are you on?

11:18.220 --> 11:20.700
Yours. Thas why sometimes
you have to listen to me.

11:20.860 --> 11:23.060
- Every now and again it might be nice.
- Here.

11:23.220 --> 11:24.940
Welcome to the Beresford,
Mr. Marshall.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.140
- Hello.
- My name is Lionel.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.580
- Lionel?
- I'm the floor butler.

11:27.740 --> 11:29.900
If there's anything you need,
please call me.

11:30.060 --> 11:33.740
Thank you. This is Jerry,
and this is Dan, and the dog is Rufus.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.860
Thank you, Lionel.
Nice to meet you. Thanks.

11:36.020 --> 11:39.340
We'll call you if we need you. Chris,
will you look at me, please? Chris?

11:39.500 --> 11:42.060
- Can you look at me for a minute?
- What? I am looking at you.

11:42.220 --> 11:44.460
We're going to Maddox's thing
on Monday night.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.620
No, Jerry, we're not.

11:45.780 --> 11:48.740
See, this is when I wish your
old man were here to back me up.

11:48.940 --> 11:50.460
- What?
- I said, I wish your old man...

11:50.620 --> 11:53.420
...were here to back me up.
- My father had no use for that man.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.620
Your father knew how
to use that man.

11:57.140 --> 11:58.740
- Where are you going?
- What?

11:58.900 --> 12:01.860
- That depends. Where are you going?
- Bathroom. Alone.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.980
- Yeah. Fine. Go. Great. Yeah. Sure.
- Thank you.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.180
Call me if you need anything.

12:10.780 --> 12:13.100
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, sir.

12:17.260 --> 12:18.940
Thank you.

12:32.220 --> 12:33.820
Sir.

12:34.900 --> 12:37.620
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm so clumsy.

12:37.780 --> 12:40.180
- Happens to all of us. Here.
- Thank you.

12:40.340 --> 12:42.260
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

12:43.340 --> 12:46.260
- Where do those go?
- Caroline Lane. Park Suite.

12:46.420 --> 12:49.700
She just checked in with a request
for immediate unpack and press.

12:49.860 --> 12:52.740
Here. Blood and Dolce:

12:54.100 --> 12:57.900
Thank you. Thank you.

12:59.020 --> 13:01.380
I mean, there are limits.

13:02.700 --> 13:06.940
You're so bad. You really are, Rach.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.660
Yes, just hold on a second.

13:09.820 --> 13:12.500
Thank you. Anything, I mean,
is up and down.

13:12.660 --> 13:15.620
One day, we're looking at rings,
and the next day, we're breaking up.

13:15.780 --> 13:18.380
Yeah. No way.

13:18.540 --> 13:20.300
So I...

13:20.460 --> 13:25.900
...had my assistant accidentally forward
my calendar for the week to his e-mail.

13:26.380 --> 13:31.340
Of course, I added a few extra lunch
dates and dinner parties with my ex.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.740
Fantastic, right?

13:34.260 --> 13:37.540
Eric will be furious.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.580
- That needs pressing.
- Okay.

13:41.100 --> 13:44.180
But les not forget Eric trades
commodities for a living.

13:44.340 --> 13:48.700
A little competition right now
might increase my market value.

13:49.980 --> 13:53.740
Listen, my darling, I'm going
to be late. I'll call you later, okay?

13:54.980 --> 13:56.300
Excuse me. Sorry.

13:56.460 --> 14:00.140
Could you just hold up those two
outfits that Dolce sent over earlier?

14:01.660 --> 14:03.460
These two?

14:04.300 --> 14:08.340
Well, I just simply can't tell
without the stockings.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.380
Could I ask you an enormous favor?

14:12.660 --> 14:17.420
I mean, I know this isn't your job,
and I'd never normally ask, but I'm so...

14:17.580 --> 14:20.620
- Is okay.
- You're such a doll.

14:20.780 --> 14:23.700
Would you run down to Madison
and get me three pairs of pantyhose?

14:23.860 --> 14:27.380
- The concierge usually does that.
- Yes, but it will get lost in translation.

14:27.540 --> 14:29.820
Please. You look like
you're someone...

14:29.980 --> 14:32.900
...who knows the difference
between taupe and caramel.

14:34.220 --> 14:37.060
- Okay.
- Thanks.

14:38.620 --> 14:40.580
Here. Thank you so much.

14:40.740 --> 14:42.700
- Okay.
- Oh, and sorry.

14:42.860 --> 14:45.740
Can you send someone else
to finish the unpacking, please?

14:45.900 --> 14:47.940
- Right away.
- Thanks.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.660
Bye.

14:49.820 --> 14:52.300
Attention! Somebody's coming!

14:54.860 --> 14:57.220
- You think is gonna rain?
- Maybe. Is possible.

14:57.420 --> 14:58.700
- Hi, where's the fire?
- Nowhere.

14:58.860 --> 15:00.860
I just got sent on an errand.
I'm already late.

15:01.020 --> 15:03.220
- Get these pressed for me?
- Sure, in my spare time.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.140
By the way, two poodles
raiding your cart.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.500
- What?
- Can't be late for Ty!

15:14.500 --> 15:17.420
Mary Anne, if you don't wear
that dress, I'm gonna come over.

15:17.580 --> 15:20.780
I'm gonna go in your closet.
I'm gonna put it on for you.

15:21.740 --> 15:23.260
Wait. Hold on a sec.

15:23.580 --> 15:25.700
Excuse me, miss?
Where are you going?

15:25.860 --> 15:28.100
- In back to see if Carrie's here.
- Carrie's not here.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.860
So could you just step away?

15:30.020 --> 15:31.140
Away.

15:31.340 --> 15:34.180
Away. Away from there.
Thank you.

15:34.420 --> 15:37.660
Hi. Sorry. Okay, so you go first.

15:37.820 --> 15:40.940
No, you! No, you.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.700
Get out.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.140
- Get out.
- Excuse me, just a moment.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.340
You know what? I have customers,
so go on quick.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.580
Yeah. Then what?

15:51.740 --> 15:53.180
No, he didn't.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.460
- No, he didn't.
- Can I just ask you one question?

15:55.620 --> 16:00.300
You know what, ma'am?
You have to wait. Okay?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.900
What? No, a maid.

16:04.260 --> 16:05.620
- I don't know.
- Yo.

16:05.780 --> 16:07.820
- You can't be back here.
- Leezette?

16:07.980 --> 16:09.500
What are you doing?

16:09.660 --> 16:12.100
Being that we're sisters
in the service business...

16:12.260 --> 16:13.340
...and I'm in a rush...

16:13.500 --> 16:16.020
...l'd say you start serving
your low-end customers...

16:16.180 --> 16:18.060
...because thas
the reason you're here.

16:18.220 --> 16:20.900
Unless we're not good enough
for you to service.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.380
In which case,
I'm sure your manager is.

16:23.540 --> 16:25.660
What do you say, ladies?
Am I right or am I right?

16:25.820 --> 16:28.020
- You're right.
- Oh, yes.

16:31.180 --> 16:33.340
- Sorry, Mom.
- Baby, where were you?

16:33.500 --> 16:34.580
Keef, do me a favor.

16:34.740 --> 16:36.460
These go to the goddess
in the Park Suite.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.780
- I got you. Don't forget the bags.
- Thank you.

16:39.940 --> 16:41.140
Are you ready?

16:41.300 --> 16:44.180
- I'm not gonna have time to change.
- Sure you do. We'll be a little late.

16:44.340 --> 16:47.020
No, Ma, we cannot be late, okay?

16:47.180 --> 16:48.700
- Come on.
- I was on time.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.860
Are they here yet?

17:09.579 --> 17:10.540
- Hello?
- Marisa?

17:10.700 --> 17:13.700
Yeah. Marcus. Yeah.

17:13.859 --> 17:15.339
No, I can't hear you.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.380
- When's Ty's speech again?
- I'll get it.

17:18.540 --> 17:20.700
In 20 minutes, at 4:00.

17:20.859 --> 17:23.300
- And you cannot be late.
- Well...

17:23.500 --> 17:24.980
Marcus!

17:25.900 --> 17:28.780
- You're just breaking up. What?
- I can't be there. I'm in Miami.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.500
- Please tell me you're kidding.
- I'm in Miami with Mugsy.

17:31.660 --> 17:33.820
Don't do this to me, Marcus.

17:33.980 --> 17:36.900
Don't let him get away with it.
Be strong, Marisa.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.260
What am I supposed
to tell him this time?

17:39.420 --> 17:41.140
- This weekend is the holiday.
- I know.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.420
- He's counting on it.
- He'll get over it.

17:43.580 --> 17:46.780
- I'll take him at Christmas, okay?
- Tell somebody who believes you.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.900
I gotta go.

17:50.660 --> 17:52.420
That shit.

17:54.060 --> 17:55.900
This fell out of your bag. Is it yours?

17:57.260 --> 17:59.620
Yeah, thanks.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.980
Management, huh?

18:03.660 --> 18:05.060
Que fancy.

18:08.140 --> 18:09.420
What?

18:10.220 --> 18:11.620
I'm not saying a word.

18:11.820 --> 18:14.660
Can you not say a word
somewhere else?

18:16.300 --> 18:19.900
And our next speaker
will be Ty Ventura.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.100
Richard Milhous Nixon...

18:48.780 --> 18:51.780
...was a man
of many contradictions.

18:53.420 --> 18:56.420
Even though
he is remembered in history...

18:56.620 --> 18:59.900
...as the only president
to ever resign...

19:03.660 --> 19:07.940
...his foreign policies
and his relations with China...

19:08.140 --> 19:12.220
...opened up the Western door
to Eastern...

19:12.380 --> 19:16.220
I mean, Eastern door
to Western ties.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.180
Thas enough.

19:18.660 --> 19:22.780
Born a Quaker,
he was nevertheless...

19:23.740 --> 19:27.340
He was responsible for bombing...

19:27.500 --> 19:31.300
...for the violent bombing of...

19:32.660 --> 19:37.060
Richard Nixon was born in...

20:01.100 --> 20:03.140
Hey, baby.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.700
They were all laughing at me,
and then I lost my words.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.740
You know, it happens
sometimes, honey.

20:12.940 --> 20:16.020
I never want to do that again, okay?

20:18.340 --> 20:20.860
You're going to do better next time.

20:21.020 --> 20:22.660
No.

20:25.380 --> 20:28.020
All right, we'll talk about it later...

20:28.180 --> 20:32.860
...because I got something for you.
The new Nixon tapes.

20:36.140 --> 20:39.460
Come on, you know
you wanna open it.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.340
Mom.

20:46.140 --> 20:47.820
Oh, papi.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.340
I'm sorry.

20:52.820 --> 20:54.820
Where's Dad?

20:56.900 --> 20:59.180
He had a construction job
in Poughkeepsie.

20:59.340 --> 21:02.140
It was paying time and a half,
and he had to do it, baby.

21:03.540 --> 21:04.780
Is okay.

21:04.940 --> 21:08.780
So you'll hang out with me
at the hotel this weekend, okay?

21:19.300 --> 21:21.060
A married guy was buying
clothes for his girlfriend.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.300
I know. He gave me
his number yesterday.

21:23.460 --> 21:25.380
- Whas up, Frannie, Michelle?
- Good morning.

21:25.540 --> 21:28.580
- Hey, Ty, how are you?
- Whas up, Ty?

21:31.340 --> 21:32.780
Lily?

21:32.940 --> 21:34.860
We're here.

21:35.020 --> 21:38.900
Hey, are you going to keep me
company today, Ty?

21:39.060 --> 21:40.860
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:41.020 --> 21:46.060
Now, he's got books and puzzles
and all kinds of fun stuff. Right, baby?

21:48.460 --> 21:51.580
- I'm on 22 if you need me, okay?
- Okay.

21:51.940 --> 21:54.300
So I'll see you at lunchtime.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.540
You all right?

21:59.380 --> 22:00.580
I'm cool.

22:04.700 --> 22:07.100
You know, I am really sorry
about all this.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.180
Is not your fault.

22:13.580 --> 22:16.660
- See you later. Thank you.
- Sure.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.020
Whas with the face?

22:22.180 --> 22:25.340
He's a kid. He has
a whole hotel to play with.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.780
- We come here every day.
- He'll have a ball.

22:27.940 --> 22:29.020
You said it.

22:29.700 --> 22:32.820
- You need to loosen up.
- I'm not interested.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.620
- Why are you stealing my tissues?
- I need them.

22:34.780 --> 22:39.260
While you're there, get me soap,
shower caps, some Kiehl's.

22:39.420 --> 22:43.740
We need some fun in our lives.
Be spontaneous, kick up our skirts.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.940
- The expression is "heels."
- Maybe for you.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.980
- I'm with you, girl.
- You only live once.

22:49.140 --> 22:51.500
- You know. Come on.
- No.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.020
Live it, girl.

22:55.180 --> 22:56.980
I'm living.

22:57.140 --> 22:58.140
I'm living.

22:59.020 --> 23:02.260
Come on, help me clean the
Park Suite. You're not doing nothing.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.980
Oh, sorry. Aren't you
the maid I had yesterday?

23:08.140 --> 23:10.940
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, fantastic. I need another favor.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.780
I'm late for lunch,
otherwise I'd do it.

23:12.940 --> 23:16.740
Would you run down to the boutique
and return the outfits in the closet?

23:16.940 --> 23:19.460
- Sure, I'll take care of it.
- Thank you. You're the best.

23:19.620 --> 23:21.060
Okay.

23:21.260 --> 23:23.300
- Who's she?
- She's the goddess.

23:23.460 --> 23:26.180
She's staying in the Park Suite.
You two have a lot in common.

23:26.340 --> 23:28.660
Yeah? Then why am I the one
wearing the uniform?

23:28.820 --> 23:31.180
What I meant was
that she also has a boyfriend...

23:31.340 --> 23:34.100
...who she's been with for a while,
who still has not popped...

23:34.260 --> 23:36.780
Her cherry?
Because then we'd be identical.

23:36.940 --> 23:40.740
- What are you looking at?
- I meant the question.

23:40.900 --> 23:43.140
My God, is your mind always...

23:43.300 --> 23:45.380
...on the pepperoni?

23:45.580 --> 23:47.700
Thas right, baby.

23:57.620 --> 24:00.700
All right, here's the difference
between me and the goddess.

24:00.860 --> 24:03.300
She's playing games
to trick him into wanting her...

24:03.460 --> 24:06.060
- And you're what?
- I'm working hard for the money.

24:06.220 --> 24:09.940
Speaking of which, you hand
in your application? Management?

24:10.100 --> 24:11.540
Yeah.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.300
What are you doing?

24:16.140 --> 24:19.620
- Dolce, nice.
- No, no, come on, get out of there.

24:19.780 --> 24:22.620
I'm just taking a little peek.
They're going back anyway.

24:22.780 --> 24:24.340
You're gonna get us in trouble.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.660
Hello, ladies.

24:26.860 --> 24:28.540
Leave that stuff alone. Come on.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.660
You're supposed to be
helping me out in here.

24:30.860 --> 24:33.020
Feel this material.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.980
I mean, is like butter.

24:38.180 --> 24:40.220
Oh, my God.

24:40.380 --> 24:43.180
This stuff is $5000.

24:43.340 --> 24:46.820
For one white outfit?
How do you keep it clean?

24:47.020 --> 24:48.100
Scotchgard.

24:48.300 --> 24:50.140
Oh, yeah.
They're a 6, you're a 6.

24:50.300 --> 24:52.420
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

24:52.580 --> 24:54.500
And shoes too.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.900
Shoes. Size 9. Perfect.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.660
- I'm a 71 l2.
- Which means you're an 8.

24:58.820 --> 25:01.700
Just put on some gym socks,
you're good to go.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.820
Thas it. Put this stuff back.
What are you doing?

25:04.980 --> 25:06.300
Not until you try it on.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.380
I can't try on her clothes!

25:08.860 --> 25:12.820
They're not hers. They're not Dolce's.
Technically, they've been abandoned.

25:12.980 --> 25:14.900
Les not let them hear us.

25:15.060 --> 25:16.020
Who, the clothes?

25:16.180 --> 25:17.580
Marisa Ave Maria Ventura...

25:17.740 --> 25:21.700
...when will you or I ever get
to try on a $5000 anything?

25:21.860 --> 25:27.420
Come on, feel how
the other half feels, huh?

25:30.020 --> 25:31.700
Hey, Lily, what are you doing?

25:31.860 --> 25:35.460
Hey. I'm sewing on a button.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.900
Whas the cook making for lunch?

25:38.060 --> 25:41.620
Saturday, you'll have
mac and cheese.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.900
Where you going?

25:49.060 --> 25:51.020
Around. I'll be right back.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.380
- Stay close, okay?
- Okay.

25:54.860 --> 25:55.820
Rufus.

25:55.980 --> 25:58.340
Rufus, come here.
Come here. Sit.

25:58.500 --> 25:59.780
- Where are you going?
- For a walk.

25:59.940 --> 26:02.380
No, there's a League of Women Voters
lunch downstairs.

26:02.540 --> 26:04.540
- We should do a drive-by.
- A quick pit stop?

26:04.700 --> 26:06.140
Yeah, in and out.
Leave them laughing.

26:06.300 --> 26:08.740
- Hey, Jer, quick question. Be honest.
- Sure thing.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.740
Do I look as stupid
as you think I am?

26:10.900 --> 26:13.500
No. I mean, you're not stupid.
What are you talking about?

26:13.660 --> 26:15.340
- Come on.
- Where are you going? No.

26:15.500 --> 26:17.380
You have a problem
with the ladies' lunch?

26:17.540 --> 26:19.940
I have a problem trying to upstage
Victor Delgado. Remember him?

26:20.140 --> 26:23.980
The guy running against me for Senate,
scheduled to speak downstairs?

26:24.140 --> 26:25.660
He's not speaking until 1:30.

26:32.620 --> 26:35.700
I know this offends your sense
of fairness, but I'd like to win.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.780
- You don't give up.
- No, of course not.

26:37.940 --> 26:40.860
Thas why you hired me.
Look, you go to the luncheon, okay?

26:41.020 --> 26:44.340
You go to Maddox's thing on Monday.
"Hello," "goodbye," you're home free.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.620
Define "free."

26:48.060 --> 26:51.820
Look, they have people who will
walk your dog for you.

26:51.980 --> 26:54.740
- I mean, I know thas a crazy idea.
- I want to walk my own dog.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.820
Relax. You're starting
to lose your hair.

26:58.860 --> 27:00.380
He's friendly.

27:00.540 --> 27:02.980
- His name is Rufus.
- Hey, Rufus.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.220
So, what are you listening to?

27:06.900 --> 27:11.460
- The Best of Bread.
- Best of Bread? Interesting.

27:11.780 --> 27:13.380
Whas your name?

27:13.660 --> 27:17.220
- Ty.
- Nice to meet you, Ty. I'm Chris.

27:17.420 --> 27:19.220
I'm bald and no one in particular.

27:19.380 --> 27:20.500
I know who you are.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.260
Yeah? What do you know?

27:24.460 --> 27:26.340
I know that you're
the state assemblyman.

27:26.540 --> 27:28.780
I know you're thinking
of running for senator.

27:28.940 --> 27:32.180
I know your voting record and
your stand on environmental causes.

27:32.620 --> 27:33.860
Great.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.020
- Look, I hate to interrupt, but...
- Are you Republican?

27:38.220 --> 27:39.700
Yes.

27:39.860 --> 27:40.980
Why?

27:41.140 --> 27:42.860
Richard Nixon was Republican.

27:43.020 --> 27:44.260
So what?

27:44.420 --> 27:46.140
- He lied.
- So, what does that mean?

27:46.300 --> 27:47.780
Nothing.

27:48.580 --> 27:50.380
Who told you to ask
these questions?

27:50.780 --> 27:51.860
Nobody.

27:52.180 --> 27:54.660
What press are you affiliated with?

27:55.140 --> 27:56.100
I'm 10.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.940
Your parents?
Democrat or Republican?

27:58.100 --> 28:00.540
- Whas the difference these days?
- I love this kid.

28:00.700 --> 28:02.540
Well, whas not to love?

28:02.860 --> 28:05.020
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna walk Rufus.

28:05.180 --> 28:08.740
What, are you writing a book?
In 10 minutes, okay?

28:08.900 --> 28:10.740
- One pee.
- Lf Mom says okay, can I come?

28:10.900 --> 28:12.780
- What?
- Lf my mom says okay, can I come?

28:12.940 --> 28:16.020
- Sure. Where's your mom?
- Back on 22. Park Suite.

28:16.180 --> 28:18.100
No, you know what, Chris?
You're in a hurry.

28:18.260 --> 28:21.460
- He doesn't have time.
- No, he's in a hurry. I'm fine.

28:21.620 --> 28:22.780
- You take him.
- What?

28:22.940 --> 28:24.900
I'll go up with you.
I forgot his ball anyway.

28:25.060 --> 28:27.260
I don't want to... Wait!

28:30.860 --> 28:32.820
Hold on!

28:37.420 --> 28:39.180
Hi, honey. Is Ty!

28:39.340 --> 28:41.260
What are you doing up here?

28:41.420 --> 28:42.420
Where's Mom?

28:46.060 --> 28:47.780
Is for you, ma'am.

28:47.940 --> 28:49.540
What are you talking about?
Ty, don't you...?

28:49.700 --> 28:52.860
Hey, Ma, this is Chris. He's got
a giant gray dog named Rufus.

28:53.020 --> 28:56.580
And if you say okay,
I'm gonna go walk with him, okay?

28:56.780 --> 28:58.660
- Hello.
- Hi.

28:58.820 --> 29:02.660
Les not forget. I'm a kid and I need
fresh air. Please, can I go, Mom?

29:02.860 --> 29:04.660
I'm Chris Marshall.

29:04.980 --> 29:06.460
Caroline...

29:07.340 --> 29:08.540
...you want your coat?

29:08.700 --> 29:11.380
- What?
- The weather can be so tricky here.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.380
Weren't you saying
what a beautiful day it was?

29:13.740 --> 29:15.100
Oh, you're going out?

29:15.260 --> 29:18.060
Weren't you saying how you
wanted to stretch your legs?

29:18.220 --> 29:20.420
Well, if your husband
wouldn't mind...

29:20.580 --> 29:22.740
She doesn't have a husband.

29:23.340 --> 29:25.220
- I don't have a husband.
- I insist, then.

29:25.420 --> 29:27.180
- Come with us, if you're free.
- Yeah.

29:27.340 --> 29:29.180
- Come on, Mom.
- Here we go.

29:29.340 --> 29:31.060
I can't.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.780
- Put these on.
- The shoes are too big.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.220
Have a good time. Have fun.

29:38.020 --> 29:41.540
- Come on, Ty, les go find Rufus.
- Come on, Mom.

29:41.740 --> 29:44.220
Mr. Marshall, John Bextrum,
hotel manager.

29:44.380 --> 29:45.500
This is fun.

29:45.660 --> 29:48.220
- So be cool, okay?
- Okay.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.260
Whas this?

29:50.420 --> 29:52.380
If that slips out again,
tuck it in for me.

29:52.540 --> 29:54.980
And the night before.
You're not answering your pager.

29:55.140 --> 29:57.140
- Really? I never got the message.
- Really?

29:57.300 --> 29:58.540
You said you'd take us to Niketown.

29:58.700 --> 30:01.020
Well, here, I'll go down with you.

30:11.740 --> 30:12.900
Scotchgard?

30:23.420 --> 30:24.580
Au revoir.

30:25.020 --> 30:26.180
Bye-Bye.

30:26.340 --> 30:27.900
Bye.

30:31.500 --> 30:34.700
Come on, Rufus, just pee
because I have stuff to do.

30:34.860 --> 30:38.340
- Pee! Lift your leg.
- Jerry Siegel, is that you?

30:38.540 --> 30:40.380
Hey, Maddox, how are you?
Small world.

30:40.540 --> 30:41.740
You know Victor Delgado.

30:41.900 --> 30:44.460
Victor, Jerry Siegel,
Chris Marshall's right-hand.

30:44.620 --> 30:48.020
- You groom also?
- Thas good.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.940
I was showing Victor our new
building on 57th. Wanna join us?

30:52.100 --> 30:53.900
No, I can't. I'm jammed.
I've got...

30:54.060 --> 30:56.180
- I can see that.
- Well, I mean...

30:56.340 --> 30:58.340
Don't forget to scoop.

31:01.540 --> 31:03.740
Kill! Kill! Rufus! Kill!

31:03.900 --> 31:06.780
Les go. You're gonna
have to hold it. Come on!

31:08.420 --> 31:10.700
Okay, I'll handle it.
Walk to the park.

31:10.860 --> 31:13.540
I'll get Rufus and Jerry,
and we'll catch up. Go ahead.

31:13.700 --> 31:16.540
Guys, there's nothing here.
Just an old friend and her son.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.340
- She got a name?
- Yeah, "Unidentified Old Friend."

31:20.060 --> 31:22.700
You give me this,
I'll give you 15 minutes...

31:22.860 --> 31:24.620
...inside the benefit,
Monday night.

31:24.780 --> 31:26.180
You'll get us in at the Met?

31:26.340 --> 31:27.660
- You got it.
- Open bar?

31:27.820 --> 31:30.460
- Don't push it.
- Thank you.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.340
Come on, Rufus.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.380
Did you have fun
with mean, old Jerry?

31:35.540 --> 31:37.500
A great time!
It was perfect timing.

31:37.660 --> 31:41.220
Both Delgado and Maddox
saw me walking your goddamn dog.

31:41.420 --> 31:44.260
See, you should get out more.
Come on, Rufus.

31:44.420 --> 31:46.820
He's gonna be there.
He's gonna be there at 1:30.

31:46.980 --> 31:50.060
I want you there at 1:00, okay?
All right? Okay?

31:50.220 --> 31:52.460
Bye. I'm going to shower.

31:53.260 --> 31:54.320
I just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

31:54.420 --> 31:56.300
I just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

31:56.460 --> 31:58.500
- Wait up!
- Don't say anything. Just act...

32:00.820 --> 32:03.500
I couldn't do it.
All those photographers all the time.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.980
You don't know what you can do
until you have to.

32:06.140 --> 32:08.900
There's not a lot of choice.
You get used to it.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.060
- Can I take him?
- Sure. Go ahead.

32:11.220 --> 32:12.900
- Be careful. He's strong.
- Come on.

32:13.060 --> 32:15.500
- Be careful and stay close.
- I will.

32:16.820 --> 32:18.420
Hang on!

32:21.420 --> 32:25.260
Thanks for this.
He's been a little down lately.

32:25.420 --> 32:28.820
Then yesterday, he gave a speech
at school, and he messed it up.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.020
It was bad.

32:30.220 --> 32:33.540
Speeches can be tricky.
What happened?

32:33.740 --> 32:36.100
I don't know.
He just froze and ran off-stage.

32:36.300 --> 32:39.620
Now he has this thing about speaking
in public. He's all freaked out.

32:39.820 --> 32:42.620
I always get nervous
before I go on.

32:43.020 --> 32:45.860
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.860
Well, not always.
Just sometimes.

32:50.380 --> 32:52.020
- Mr. Marshall?
- Look at the dogs.

32:52.180 --> 32:55.620
What a surprise, a dog walker.
Let me guess. Jerry sent you.

32:55.820 --> 32:57.660
Yeah, to get Rufus.

32:57.820 --> 32:59.180
- Is that Rufus?
- Thas him.

32:59.340 --> 33:00.700
He's beautiful.

33:00.860 --> 33:02.500
- Can I?
- Sure.

33:02.660 --> 33:04.020
- Hey, buddy!
- Can I have him?

33:04.180 --> 33:06.180
- Okay.
- Thank you.

33:06.460 --> 33:08.780
- Ma, can I go play?
- Yeah, go ahead.

33:09.700 --> 33:10.860
This is for you.

33:11.420 --> 33:14.180
- Thank you.
- Bye. Les go.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.380
Is from my nanny.

33:18.620 --> 33:20.300
Do you want to sit down?

33:20.620 --> 33:23.260
- Sure.
- Over here.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.740
Cool, I won't get dirty.

33:32.300 --> 33:35.980
Oh, Lord! I almost sat on your face.
Right there.

33:48.140 --> 33:50.740
Ty seems like a terrific kid.

33:51.180 --> 33:53.900
Thanks. I'm kind of crazy
about him.

33:54.060 --> 33:58.460
I've never met a 10-year-old
Nixon aficionado.

33:58.620 --> 34:02.660
Yeah, I know. Last year,
they studied the '70s at school...

34:02.820 --> 34:05.580
...and he's become obsessed
with the politics, the music.

34:05.740 --> 34:07.660
He was reading
the Kissinger biography.

34:07.820 --> 34:09.500
- You're kidding!
- No.

34:09.659 --> 34:13.739
I'm waiting for him to discover another
decade. Until then, I'm learning a lot.

34:14.020 --> 34:16.900
Well, I think is great.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.860
- You do?
- I do.

34:21.580 --> 34:24.500
Guess what? I threw a stick
in the air, and Rufus caught it!

34:24.659 --> 34:27.900
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm gonna go do it again.

34:28.340 --> 34:32.139
So how long are you
in town for?

34:34.100 --> 34:35.620
I'm not sure.

34:35.820 --> 34:37.500
You always stay at the Beresford?

34:39.620 --> 34:42.500
Sometimes I feel like I live there.

34:43.020 --> 34:45.060
So, what brings you here?

34:46.060 --> 34:48.940
- Work.
- What do you do?

34:51.380 --> 34:54.699
- Oh, my God! 11:00, by the tree.
- What?

34:54.860 --> 34:56.739
Check it, 11:00.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.540
Thas Eddie Yatter.

34:58.700 --> 35:01.580
- What does he want?
- He's paparazzi. I can't shake him.

35:01.740 --> 35:04.060
He works for Blanton Maddox...

35:04.220 --> 35:07.020
...whose goal lately is
to catch me with another woman...

35:07.180 --> 35:11.820
...so his sleazy tabloid can say
that I've broken up with...

35:11.980 --> 35:14.380
Your supermodel fiancée?

35:14.540 --> 35:16.060
Oh, God! Ty!

35:16.220 --> 35:18.260
- What?
- Come on!

35:19.020 --> 35:21.860
- I just realized that you...
- Excuse me?

35:22.020 --> 35:24.420
- Sorry, is just that my face is...
- What?

35:24.580 --> 35:27.060
- Whas wrong with your face?
- Is stuck to your...

35:27.220 --> 35:28.700
Whas that?

35:28.860 --> 35:33.380
- Oh, God. Oh, God! Get it off.
- Here, let me. Is okay.

35:33.580 --> 35:36.740
Oh, my God! Did I get
anything on it? Is it okay?

35:36.900 --> 35:38.500
Is perfect.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.700
- So...
- Okay.

35:42.860 --> 35:45.060
Don't believe everything you read.

35:45.220 --> 35:47.940
- Any of it true?
- No.

35:48.100 --> 35:52.780
Well, we were seeing each other.
Now we're seeing less of each other.

35:52.940 --> 35:54.980
Is complicated.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.540
I want to show you something.
Follow me.

36:04.700 --> 36:05.860
Oh, God.

36:06.060 --> 36:10.380
- Let me help you.
- I got it. Is fine. I'm good.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.420
Don't worry about me.

36:13.580 --> 36:15.580
Look at that.

36:18.620 --> 36:20.940
Is like two different worlds.

36:21.340 --> 36:24.260
- Interesting perspective, huh?
- Yeah.

36:24.460 --> 36:27.180
And I'd like to point out
is paparazzi-free.

36:28.580 --> 36:31.940
You know when I come here most
is when I have to make a speech...

36:32.140 --> 36:33.420
...and I get nervous.

36:33.580 --> 36:34.860
- You get nervous?
- Sure.

36:35.020 --> 36:35.980
See that?

36:36.140 --> 36:39.100
Sometimes when I have
to stand up in front of people...

36:39.260 --> 36:43.020
...my heart kind of races,
and I can't remember my words.

36:43.180 --> 36:46.500
- Same here. I know.
- Really? Same with you?

36:46.660 --> 36:49.700
Wow. Well, in my business,
is not a good thing.

36:50.060 --> 36:52.620
- What do you do?
- What do I do?

36:53.220 --> 36:54.940
I want to show you something.

36:56.100 --> 36:59.500
I hold on to this.

37:00.300 --> 37:02.340
A paper clip?
Was that a paper clip?

37:02.540 --> 37:04.180
It was.
I had to find something...

37:04.340 --> 37:06.740
...to draw the nervous energy
away from my heart.

37:06.900 --> 37:08.540
Like a...

37:08.700 --> 37:11.780
- Like a lightning rod?
- Like a lightning rod. Exactly.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.860
All the energy
goes into the paper clip.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.060
And then whas left is...

37:16.260 --> 37:17.660
Your speech.

37:17.820 --> 37:20.580
Yeah, a smooth,
and I'd like to think...

37:20.740 --> 37:23.260
...very compelling speech.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.940
Some of the best speakers
in history...

37:28.140 --> 37:29.900
...a paper clip.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.500
Let me see, Henry Kissinger.

37:33.020 --> 37:35.060
He wasn't known
for his speaking abilities.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.580
No, he wasn't, was he?

37:39.820 --> 37:43.060
Well, imagine what he woulďve
been like without the:

37:44.060 --> 37:46.780
- He woulďve really sucked.
- He woulďve what?

37:46.940 --> 37:48.540
- Really sucked.
- Right.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.300
So maybe you'll try again?

37:54.620 --> 37:56.940
Hey, Ma,
can we go see the penguins?

37:58.900 --> 38:02.060
- Les go see penguins.
- Five minutes.

38:04.220 --> 38:06.460
- You're a bad influence.
- I am?

38:06.620 --> 38:08.060
Hurry up!

38:14.540 --> 38:15.900
Look at this guy go.

38:18.700 --> 38:19.980
They're so funny.

38:20.140 --> 38:23.460
They look like little, fat,
short guys with tuxedos.

38:23.660 --> 38:26.860
Speaking of fat guys in tuxedos,
there's this thing Monday night.

38:27.020 --> 38:31.380
Is a black-tie.
Is a $2500-a-plate dinner.

38:31.540 --> 38:35.500
- Oh, my God. $2500 per plate?
- $2500 a plate.

38:35.660 --> 38:38.980
- I hope you get to keep the plate.
- You can if you want.

38:39.820 --> 38:40.900
What is it for?

38:41.060 --> 38:44.060
For the inner-city literacy campaign,
something I support.

38:44.220 --> 38:47.140
Is a big benefit that Maddox
throws every year.

38:47.300 --> 38:51.460
Is not quite as boring as it sounds.
I don't know, are you interested?

38:52.540 --> 38:56.580
Wait a minute. Isn't that the guy who
hired Yatter to get pictures of you?

38:56.780 --> 38:58.060
Yes, it is.

38:58.620 --> 39:00.260
I don't get it.
Why would you go?

39:00.420 --> 39:04.740
I go because... I go...
Is exposure.

39:05.380 --> 39:08.140
Won't everyone know you're there
just to expose yourself?

39:08.300 --> 39:11.300
Well, I kind of
have to expose myself.

39:11.460 --> 39:14.500
- When you put it that way...
- I didn't. You put it that way.

39:15.060 --> 39:17.140
I don't care how much
you pay for dinner.

39:17.300 --> 39:20.380
You shouldn't serve yourself up,
no matter what the cause.

39:20.540 --> 39:23.020
So why don't you tell me
what you really think.

39:23.180 --> 39:25.660
You really want me
to tell you what I think?

39:25.820 --> 39:30.300
If Mr. Wanton Maddox, or whatever
his name is, really wants to help...

39:30.460 --> 39:33.820
...why doesn't he give the $2500
per plate to the inner-city schools?

39:33.980 --> 39:36.780
And eat a little bit lighter that night,
you know?

39:37.340 --> 39:40.660
So why don't you come with me
and tell him yourself.

39:41.660 --> 39:43.220
Monday...

39:43.380 --> 39:45.380
...l'm busy. Sorry.

39:45.660 --> 39:49.900
You're busy, you can't?
What? Can you change it?

39:50.100 --> 39:52.060
Is complicated.

39:52.940 --> 39:56.460
Which reminds me, I gotta get
out of here. Come on, we gotta go.

39:56.620 --> 39:59.940
- We gotta go. We're gonna be late.
- Do we have to?

40:01.740 --> 40:04.100
- I gotta get back.
- Caroline.

40:04.620 --> 40:08.300
This can't be it. Come on,
we haven't seen the snakes.

40:08.460 --> 40:10.380
Except for Yatter.

40:11.620 --> 40:15.220
It was nice meeting you,
Chris Marshall.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.900
We're late. We gotta go.
Come on.

40:23.060 --> 40:24.780
Here, Ty...

40:25.700 --> 40:28.660
- Don't use them all on one speech.
- I won't.

40:29.660 --> 40:33.100
- Keep up the good voting record.
- I'll do my best.

40:38.580 --> 40:40.940
"Is complicated."
What kind of answer is that?

40:41.100 --> 40:42.340
Honest.

40:42.500 --> 40:46.020
The only thing complicated between
me and him would be my bra strap.

40:46.180 --> 40:49.780
Look, what am I supposed to do?
Make his bed with me in it?

40:49.940 --> 40:50.980
Get real!

40:51.180 --> 40:54.020
- He thinks I'm a guest here.
- All right. All right.

40:54.180 --> 40:56.580
But just tell me what he was like.

40:57.260 --> 40:59.780
Sexy eyes.

40:59.980 --> 41:01.860
And nice lips.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.900
What about the hands?
Were they big?

41:10.060 --> 41:13.500
- They were perfect.
- Perfect works.

41:13.660 --> 41:15.340
- Marisa!
- Who? What?

41:15.500 --> 41:18.820
- Marisa Ventura, are you back there?
- Oh, my God, is Paula!

41:29.660 --> 41:31.780
What are you doing?

41:31.980 --> 41:34.580
I just...
I spilled something on my apron...

41:34.740 --> 41:37.820
...so I was cleaning it,
and she was helping me tie it.

41:37.980 --> 41:40.540
Mr. Bextrum wants to see you
in his office right now.

41:47.180 --> 41:48.660
Oh, shit!

41:51.980 --> 41:55.340
Look who's here.
Les review the last hour, okay?

41:55.500 --> 41:59.180
Delgado killed while you were
out walking that goddamn dog.

41:59.340 --> 42:02.340
- You got a pen that works?
- Sure. Here you go.

42:02.540 --> 42:05.380
- Anything else I can do for you?
- No, thas good, thanks.

42:05.540 --> 42:07.900
Get this note to the woman
in the Park Suite.

42:08.060 --> 42:10.540
Her name is Caroline.

42:10.700 --> 42:12.620
- Can you handle that for me?
- Certainly.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.620
- Thank you.
- Who's Caroline in the Park Suite?

42:15.780 --> 42:18.180
Someone I met.
You wanted me to have an escort...

42:18.340 --> 42:20.540
...for that Maddox literacy thing
on Monday night.

42:20.700 --> 42:24.620
But I was thinking more of a blind,
ex-illiterate senior citizen who learned...

42:24.780 --> 42:28.140
...to read while fighting Nazis.
- I thought your mother was in Florida.

42:28.300 --> 42:31.620
Just make sure she's not married,
on medication...

42:31.780 --> 42:33.700
...or a Democrat.
Did you check, or...?

42:33.900 --> 42:34.820
Rufus.

42:35.020 --> 42:38.100
Sure, okay, great.
Can I talk to you for a second?

42:38.260 --> 42:41.500
I want you to find out who
Caroline is in the Park Suite.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.780
Don't write it down.
Just remember it.

42:43.940 --> 42:45.260
Thanks. Good job.

42:54.860 --> 42:57.060
Come in, Miss Ventura.

42:59.940 --> 43:03.460
I assume you know the reason
you've been called here.

43:03.620 --> 43:05.740
I think so. Yes, sir.

43:06.700 --> 43:10.780
Do you know what the foundation
of a great hotel is?

43:13.940 --> 43:15.260
Location?

43:15.580 --> 43:18.660
Loyalty and trust.

43:18.860 --> 43:22.220
Would you say those are qualities
that you possess?

43:22.380 --> 43:23.860
I would. Yes, sir.

43:26.540 --> 43:28.660
Miss Burns agrees.

43:28.820 --> 43:30.860
And she's urged me
to consider you.

43:31.340 --> 43:33.740
We had no idea you were
interested in management...

43:33.900 --> 43:36.780
...until Miss Kehoe brought us
your application.

43:37.500 --> 43:41.020
By the way, you forgot
your social security number...

43:41.180 --> 43:43.500
...and your mother's maiden name.

43:43.660 --> 43:47.820
If you just fill them in
and sign right there. Perfect.

43:47.980 --> 43:52.060
Normally, you'd go through the program
and train for a year as a butler, but...

43:52.220 --> 43:55.500
- Given the circumstances...
- Due to overbooking and understaffing...

43:55.660 --> 43:57.860
...we decided to accelerate
your application.

43:58.020 --> 44:01.060
And move you into management
after the six-week training.

44:01.260 --> 44:03.540
With the proviso that you
pass the practical exam...

44:03.700 --> 44:06.380
...and fulfill each requirement
for every station.

44:06.540 --> 44:09.220
So you see, Miss Ventura,
sometimes...

44:09.380 --> 44:13.740
...when life shuts one door,
it opens a window.

44:14.620 --> 44:16.260
So jump.

44:19.820 --> 44:22.620
Steph, where are you?
I know you're in here.

44:23.620 --> 44:26.700
- Don't tell me you're busted.
- No, you are.

44:26.860 --> 44:29.340
You know what?
You had no right!

44:29.500 --> 44:30.820
What are you talking about?

44:31.100 --> 44:33.060
You filled out
an application for me?

44:34.180 --> 44:36.860
- They're considering you.
- Do you know what you've done?

44:37.020 --> 44:39.780
- I did you a favor.
- No. If you wanna do me a favor...

44:39.940 --> 44:42.260
...then mind your own business
once in a while.

44:42.420 --> 44:45.580
For two years, you've yapped
about getting out of uniform...

44:45.740 --> 44:47.180
...and what ideas you got.

44:47.340 --> 44:50.660
This morning, I'm having coffee
with Rosalie from personnel...

44:50.820 --> 44:53.100
...and I ask her.
I go, "Marisa got a shot?"

44:53.260 --> 44:56.020
She goes, "Marisa who?"
I go, "Marisa Ventura. She's applied."

44:56.180 --> 44:59.220
She goes, "If she applied,
I'd slip it to the top of the pile."

44:59.380 --> 45:02.700
So I just act real nonchalantlike
and I go, "Are you sure?"

45:02.860 --> 45:05.420
So she goes, she double-checks,
and she tells me:

45:05.580 --> 45:09.940
"Marisa Ventura ain't never applied
for no management program ever."

45:10.100 --> 45:12.900
Lmagine my shock and dismay.

45:13.060 --> 45:14.860
My own partner,
lying to me like that.

45:15.020 --> 45:18.540
Then I figured maybe you were
too chickenshit, so I did it myself.

45:18.700 --> 45:20.260
If they took you,
you'd be happy.

45:20.420 --> 45:23.660
And if they didn't, you wouldn't know
the difference. So sue me!

45:23.820 --> 45:26.740
These are the golden years.
We gotta prove our mothers wrong.

45:26.900 --> 45:28.820
Don't waste them.

45:43.180 --> 45:45.260
What we did today was wrong.

45:45.420 --> 45:48.220
But you didn't really lie.
Not technically.

45:48.380 --> 45:50.260
Now you're starting
to sound like Nixon.

45:50.420 --> 45:52.380
Letting someone believe
something's true when is not...

45:52.540 --> 45:54.260
...is just as much
a lie as a lie is.

45:54.420 --> 45:58.020
I let him think I was staying in the
suite, not cleaning it. I'm the maid.

45:58.180 --> 46:01.900
I hate to break it to you,
but I don't think he's after your money.

46:02.540 --> 46:05.100
I can't believe you just said that!

46:06.180 --> 46:09.540
Just get my keys in my pocket,
please. This is hot.

46:33.140 --> 46:34.660
Good job.

46:35.220 --> 46:38.860
All right, sweetie.
Behave yourself, okay?

46:39.340 --> 46:41.700
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

46:45.380 --> 46:46.700
Can I borrow this?

46:46.860 --> 46:48.540
- Of course.
- Thank you.

46:48.700 --> 46:50.180
Baby, bye.

46:50.380 --> 46:52.220
And remember,
all security IDs...

46:52.380 --> 46:54.980
...will need to be rephotographed
starting next week.

46:55.140 --> 46:57.460
I think thas all.
Thank you very much.

46:57.620 --> 47:00.460
Barbara, Clarice,
come with me, please.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.700
- Have you seen this?
- No. What?

47:09.860 --> 47:11.580
Well, let me show you.

47:11.740 --> 47:13.220
Give me this.

47:13.780 --> 47:16.300
Yeah. So?

47:16.460 --> 47:19.820
What do you mean, "so"? What if
somebody from the hotel sees it?

47:19.980 --> 47:22.660
I hate to break the bubble.
You can't tell is you.

47:22.820 --> 47:25.860
- Don't worry about it.
- Is the front page of the paper today.

47:26.020 --> 47:29.700
Stop. You do one spontaneous thing,
you think you're going to hell.

47:29.860 --> 47:31.820
Do you understand
this could be bad?

47:31.980 --> 47:34.980
Don't be such a Catholic. Please.
Come on.

47:40.580 --> 47:42.260
Good morning.
Nice to see you.

47:42.420 --> 47:44.420
- Can I steal him away for a second?
- Sure.

47:44.620 --> 47:47.340
- Let me steal you away.
- Excuse me.

47:47.940 --> 47:50.180
- I want to talk to you.
- Whas the problem?

47:50.660 --> 47:53.100
This! Do you know
what this is gonna cost me?

47:53.260 --> 47:56.300
An entire day of doing nothing
but covering your ass.

47:56.460 --> 47:59.420
I'm getting calls from The London
Times, The Washington Post...

47:59.580 --> 48:02.660
...the Chicago Sun, asking
about her identity, her background...

48:02.820 --> 48:05.500
...who the kid is. A kid!

48:07.020 --> 48:10.500
Just when I get them to focus on your
assets, they're focusing on hers.

48:10.660 --> 48:11.780
Thanks.

48:11.980 --> 48:15.740
Yeah, well, they're fantastic assets,
don't you think?

48:21.740 --> 48:27.460
Squeezing the circle
tighter and tighter and tighter...

48:27.620 --> 48:30.660
...and release.
Les try that again.

48:30.860 --> 48:35.140
And squeeze the circle
tighter, tighter...

48:35.300 --> 48:38.820
...and relax.
- Sorry, I'll come back.

48:39.860 --> 48:41.860
Thas okay.
You can work around us.

48:42.060 --> 48:45.100
We could use some more towels,
por favor. Rapido.

48:45.260 --> 48:48.340
Squeezing the circle tighter...

48:48.500 --> 48:51.300
...and tighter and tighter.

48:51.460 --> 48:53.580
Radiating from the pelvis.

48:53.780 --> 48:56.700
Good. Breathe.

48:56.860 --> 48:58.580
Exhale.

48:58.740 --> 49:00.300
Are you all right?

49:01.100 --> 49:04.780
Twinkles, is it Eric?
I knew it.

49:07.180 --> 49:09.220
He hasn't called once.

49:09.420 --> 49:12.020
Not my cell, not the service,
not the hotel.

49:12.340 --> 49:17.740
So last night I called him, and...
Rach, he was with...

49:17.900 --> 49:20.940
I can't. Is like cheap wine.

49:21.100 --> 49:24.260
- Shall we do some band work, ladies?
- Go on, I'm listening.

49:24.420 --> 49:27.060
- I heard her in the background.
- The cheap wine?

49:27.220 --> 49:30.540
His ex, in midlaugh.

49:30.780 --> 49:32.060
Butler service, Miss Lane.

49:33.260 --> 49:36.380
I have a message
from Mr. Christopher Marshall.

49:36.540 --> 49:38.620
Christopher Marshall?

49:38.780 --> 49:41.100
As in, Christopher Marshall?

49:42.220 --> 49:45.180
He's staying in the York Suite
and was wondering...

49:45.340 --> 49:47.580
...if you had a response
to the luncheon invitation...

49:47.740 --> 49:50.140
...I placed in your room yesterday.

49:50.340 --> 49:52.900
- We're through. Thank you.
- In my room?

49:53.100 --> 49:55.180
- I have to charge the full hour.
- Yesterday.

49:55.340 --> 49:56.420
- Fine.
- For lunch?

49:56.580 --> 49:58.020
- For two.
- Get out!

49:58.180 --> 49:59.900
- Where?
- In his suite.

50:00.700 --> 50:02.500
This is a miracle.

50:03.660 --> 50:07.260
- Shall I give him an answer?
- Yes. Tell him yes. What time?

50:07.420 --> 50:09.940
- 1 p.m.
- She'll be there. Thank you.

50:10.100 --> 50:11.620
When did this go down?

50:11.780 --> 50:14.740
We met at this thing
in Southampton last summer.

50:14.900 --> 50:17.540
I thought we had a moment.

50:17.740 --> 50:19.700
"Can you steal away an hour,
please?"

50:19.860 --> 50:23.900
- You think he saw you in the hall?
- Who cares? What should I wear?

50:24.060 --> 50:26.020
You look good in anything.

50:26.180 --> 50:28.180
But I didn't bring a thing!

50:28.340 --> 50:29.540
Les see.

50:33.100 --> 50:36.340
Maria, thank goodness.
I need a favor. Is urgent.

50:36.500 --> 50:39.700
Could you get those outfits
you returned for me yesterday?

50:39.860 --> 50:42.580
There's this divine
Dolce cashmere coat. Is just...

50:42.740 --> 50:47.060
Actually, they're still in the closet.
I thought you might want a second look.

50:47.620 --> 50:50.500
You are so good.
Thank God!

50:50.700 --> 50:53.900
- You should be a personal assistant.
- She's a maid.

50:54.060 --> 50:58.820
- So are they, with better titles.
- Actually, I'm up for a position.

50:58.980 --> 51:00.660
What do you think?

51:01.140 --> 51:03.100
Dolce coat, Gucci pants...

51:03.260 --> 51:06.020
...or Ralph Lauren skirt,
Manolo pumps?

51:06.180 --> 51:08.260
They're both divine!
Les see.

51:08.460 --> 51:11.140
How about the pants, open sandals,
see-through blouse...

51:11.300 --> 51:13.780
...colored bra and carry
the Dolce coat for effect.

51:14.100 --> 51:17.580
- Maria?
- She barely speaks English.

51:19.420 --> 51:21.540
- What?
- Excuse me?

51:21.700 --> 51:24.460
Maria, what do you think?

51:25.340 --> 51:27.460
What about the beaded skirt
with that beige...

51:27.620 --> 51:29.900
...crocheted halter
you have in the closet?

51:30.060 --> 51:32.300
You know, casual sexy.
No stockings.

51:32.460 --> 51:34.980
Definitely eighty-six the coat.
It sends the wrong message.

51:35.140 --> 51:36.700
Like you're going someplace.

51:36.860 --> 51:40.660
Besides, that whole see-through
blouse, colored-bra thing...

51:40.820 --> 51:45.700
...reads a little desperate, older gal,
trying too hard. Don't you think?

51:47.460 --> 51:49.740
You want to make him work for it.

51:50.060 --> 51:52.700
Who does she think she is
to talk to me like that?

51:52.860 --> 51:54.500
Thank you, Maria.

51:54.660 --> 51:58.660
I have two words for you,
Rachel Hoffberg: Eric who?

52:00.220 --> 52:02.700
Excuse me. Sorry.

52:05.020 --> 52:06.700
Yes, thas it.

52:06.860 --> 52:10.380
All handles parallel
with the right elbow.

52:14.260 --> 52:17.900
Review your protocols
for table setting and wine service.

52:18.060 --> 52:21.140
We're serving lunch
at the York Suite today.

52:32.860 --> 52:35.180
Butler service, Mr. Marshall.

52:35.340 --> 52:36.580
Come on in.

52:36.740 --> 52:39.420
Rufus, is okay.
Thank you.

53:15.660 --> 53:18.740
Water glasses 3 inches east
of the wine goblets.

53:18.900 --> 53:21.420
- Make a perfect triangle.
- Yes, sir.

53:31.820 --> 53:33.700
Hold on, I'm coming.

53:37.740 --> 53:41.220
You're an animal lover too!
So am I.

53:41.900 --> 53:44.900
I just can't get enough of them.

53:46.140 --> 53:49.700
What a wonderful idea.
Lunch ř deux. Lovely!

53:50.780 --> 53:54.660
I just knew that we made
a connection at the...

53:54.820 --> 53:57.180
...Feathered Friends Tournament.

53:59.980 --> 54:01.940
Look!

54:04.060 --> 54:06.660
How sweet of you to remember.

54:07.780 --> 54:11.500
But I hope you didn't think
I needed reminding.

54:13.820 --> 54:16.580
Teddy Parrish sends you his best.

54:16.740 --> 54:17.820
Oh, Teddy.

54:18.100 --> 54:20.100
Right. Yeah.

54:20.780 --> 54:21.740
How is Teddy?

54:21.900 --> 54:24.460
Drinking again,
but you didn't hear it from me.

54:24.620 --> 54:26.500
Excuse me,
I gotta check on something.

54:26.660 --> 54:28.300
Of course.

54:31.980 --> 54:34.820
Who is that over there?

54:35.420 --> 54:37.300
Caroline Lane.

54:38.700 --> 54:41.140
No. No, is not her.

54:41.300 --> 54:42.780
- Is not her?
- No.

54:44.500 --> 54:46.180
The Maddox thing.

54:47.260 --> 54:50.020
- Are you going?
- Of course.

54:50.500 --> 54:53.620
You know who I can't figure out
where I know them from?

54:53.780 --> 54:55.660
The woman visiting you
the other day...

54:55.820 --> 54:59.620
...kind of Mediterranean,
with a little boy about 10.

54:59.780 --> 55:03.260
Rachel Hoffberg, Mediterranean?
She's from Westport.

55:03.580 --> 55:07.740
She's premenopausal,
but don't tell her I said so.

55:08.620 --> 55:11.700
You're staying in the Park Suite,
right, Caroline?

55:11.860 --> 55:14.740
Yes. Yes, I am.

55:15.900 --> 55:17.140
Good.

55:17.300 --> 55:20.420
Well, is the damnedest thing.

55:31.140 --> 55:33.540
This salmon is perfect.

55:33.820 --> 55:37.980
Your whole presentation today
has been excellent. Well done.

55:38.140 --> 55:39.620
Thank you.

55:39.820 --> 55:42.140
Make sure you tuck it in tightly.

55:42.620 --> 55:46.020
She's about 5'6", dark hair,
really beautiful, has a kid named Ty.

55:46.180 --> 55:47.900
What the hell happened?

55:48.060 --> 55:51.140
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't be sorry. Just find her.

55:51.340 --> 55:53.780
Chris, I loved your quote
in The Times.

55:53.940 --> 55:55.700
Please!

56:06.940 --> 56:10.460
We're all here to try to land
the Rothford Estate. Is worth zillions.

56:10.820 --> 56:14.220
And Sotheby's are counting on me
to lock the whole thing up.

56:14.380 --> 56:16.500
- Thank you so much.
- Really?

56:16.660 --> 56:18.540
Rufus, come here.

56:18.700 --> 56:19.980
Thank you.

56:20.140 --> 56:21.300
Sit. Sit.

56:21.460 --> 56:24.780
Maria, could I have a little water,
please?

56:25.340 --> 56:27.940
- Good boy.
- Such a sweet dog.

56:28.100 --> 56:29.060
Allow me.

56:29.860 --> 56:32.380
- That will be all.
- You know Nettie Rothford.

56:32.540 --> 56:33.740
Sure.

56:33.940 --> 56:35.740
She and I virtually grew up together.

56:35.900 --> 56:39.300
Her place was bang
next to Daddy's on the Vineyard.

56:44.540 --> 56:46.460
- Right there.
- Good evening.

56:46.620 --> 56:48.900
Another interesting day now,
huh, Marisa?

56:49.060 --> 56:52.380
- I don't know. Was it?
- You tell me.

56:52.540 --> 56:54.100
Nice lunch?

56:55.180 --> 56:57.300
All right, whas up, mystery man?

56:57.460 --> 57:00.140
How many times you watched
the monitors with me?

57:00.300 --> 57:03.900
How many times we enjoyed
the comings and goings?

57:04.060 --> 57:05.020
Thousands.

57:05.180 --> 57:08.940
You know what?
You over there, nosy body.

57:09.100 --> 57:12.500
You know I'm beholden
to report employees misbehaving.

57:13.820 --> 57:18.780
And there's only one thing
could make me shut my mouth.

57:24.940 --> 57:26.980
You dirty old man.

57:29.580 --> 57:32.260
You're in trouble.
What are you laughing at?

57:32.660 --> 57:35.740
About the silver soap dishes...

57:35.900 --> 57:37.660
Rach, darling, I'll just be a sec.

57:37.820 --> 57:40.820
- Hi, I'm Caroline Lane...
- In the Park Suite, yes.

57:40.980 --> 57:44.100
- I called about a ticket to the...
- Benefit. Monday night.

57:44.300 --> 57:48.700
We were able to procure you a single
at a table adjacent to Mr. Marshall's.

57:48.860 --> 57:51.300
Fantastic! And how much will that be?

57:51.500 --> 57:53.540
- Three thousand dollars.
- What?

57:53.740 --> 57:56.140
The rates are raised
when a couple is split.

57:56.300 --> 57:58.260
Singles are always harder to place.

57:58.420 --> 58:02.420
Well, I mean what is it?
Is it on the Internet I'm an ex-couple?

58:02.580 --> 58:05.020
I mean, does the whole hotel know?

58:05.180 --> 58:09.220
Is there a Biblical sign on my forehead?
"Unmarried, unclean"?

58:09.380 --> 58:13.220
Do I bear the scarlet letter? I'm...

58:13.420 --> 58:14.340
I'm...

58:14.540 --> 58:17.340
I'm just...
Sorry. I...

58:17.500 --> 58:19.340
I'm better now.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.780
Just charge it to my room.

58:21.940 --> 58:23.180
Yes, ma'am.

58:23.340 --> 58:26.180
Come on, Rach. Ghastly man!

58:26.340 --> 58:28.700
I am terrified to ask
what that was about.

58:28.860 --> 58:30.980
I think, being dumped.

58:31.180 --> 58:34.180
- Can I get your autograph?
- Amber? Is that your name?

58:34.340 --> 58:36.420
- Amber's your name.
- How you doing?

58:36.620 --> 58:40.340
Get in the car! Get in the car!

58:41.620 --> 58:44.940
- Did she see us?
- Yeah. No. You're fine. All's clear.

58:45.100 --> 58:47.020
- Is fine.
- How did this happen?

58:47.180 --> 58:49.260
I think she's very attractive.

58:49.420 --> 58:52.420
I had her checked out.
She comes from a family with money...

58:52.580 --> 58:54.940
...politically neutral and
has no naked pictures.

58:55.100 --> 58:57.100
That woman wasn't
the woman I wanted.

58:57.260 --> 59:00.180
I don't know what to say.
I talked to the hotel manager.

59:00.340 --> 59:03.860
Thas the only Caroline Lane
staying in the Park Suite.

59:04.020 --> 59:06.260
Wait. There she is.

59:06.660 --> 59:08.500
Thas her. Cordell, pull over.

59:12.740 --> 59:15.620
- Hey, wait! Ty! Caroline!
- Hey, Chris!

59:15.820 --> 59:18.220
- Hey. How's it going, Ty?
- Okay.

59:18.380 --> 59:19.660
- How you doing?
- Good.

59:19.820 --> 59:23.660
You want to hear something strange?
I invited you to lunch, and you came...

59:23.820 --> 59:25.020
...only it wasn't you.

59:25.540 --> 59:27.460
So, what happened?

59:27.660 --> 59:32.020
- I don't know what you mean.
- Are you still staying at the Beresford?

59:32.180 --> 59:36.020
No, we actually moved uptown.
You know, uptown.

59:36.180 --> 59:38.820
Hop in. We're going
to the Tremont Housing Projects.

59:38.980 --> 59:41.860
- We can drop you at the Upper East?
- Yeah, Mom!

59:42.060 --> 59:46.340
No. Remember, we're going to a party
just a few blocks away, so we'll walk.

59:46.540 --> 59:49.020
- So how do I get ahold of you?
- Her cell's 9-1-7...

59:49.660 --> 59:51.260
How about I call you?

59:51.420 --> 59:54.460
If you want to get in touch with him,
call this number.

59:54.620 --> 59:57.300
Thas my card.
Whas your last name, hon?

59:57.460 --> 59:59.860
- Ventura. Whas yours?
- Spanish?

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:03.220
- Jerry Spanish?
- No, Siegel. We have to go.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.820
- So do we.
- Use that number. Call anytime.

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:07.300
- All right.
- Don't be shy.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:11.380
- You're late. You have to give a speech.
- In the Bronx?

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.540
- On what?
- Housing projects.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:14.660
Really?

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.300
You're telling people
in the Bronx about the projects?

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.620
No, I'm just gonna
take the press up there...

01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.020
...and shine light
on the living conditions.

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:26.700
- Interesting.
- Yeah, we think so. Shall we? Okay?

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.660
- Bye.
- What are you not saying?

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.980
- Nothing.
- Tell me.

01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:36.740
Maybe you should spend
real time in the projects...

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:40.540
...and then you wouldn't have to make up
speeches and memorize them.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.940
You know, it would be coming
from someplace real.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.500
And how would you know? I mean...

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:49.060
Because I grew up there.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:52.100
I lived in a four-block radius
my whole life.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.180
Bye.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.140
Okay, les go. Come on.

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:02.860
- Chris!
- What?

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:07.140
Shall we? Okay? Les go.
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.380
Who the hell is she?

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:16.220
I'll tell you who she isn't. She isn't like
anyone I've met. And she isn't a phony.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:20.740
I'll make you a deal. You want me
at the benefit? Then get her to go.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.820
I swear to God, I'll shake any
part of Maddox's body you want.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.900
Deal?

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.460
Deal. All right, sure. Okay.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.260
Okay, get in.

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.820
So for right now, with the review
and everything going on...

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.180
...we need to be extra careful,
all right?

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.980
That means no coming up
in the elevator to see me.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.260
And no Chris Marshall.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:58.540
- Is not like you're breaking some law.
- Hey, I mean it.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.020
If you see him...

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:04.780
- I'll make like a baby and head out first.
- Thank you. Go to bed, okay?

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.700
- Good night, Ma.
- Bye, baby.

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.220
Heads up!

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.380
The Chinese delegation will be
checking into the Lexington Suite.

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:21.260
Please note the television channel
needs to be set to one of the Chinese...

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.940
Oh, my God. Hide me.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.700
The Shapiros have requested
an early check-in.

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.980
So we'll put them in the Dior Suite.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:30.580
Yes, sir?

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:32.580
- They're in the hall.
- What are they doing?

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:35.300
- He's got something in his hands.
- Does it look serious?

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.260
Calm down, is just a letter.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.300
- Find that girl.
- Certainly.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.420
- He's coming.
- Be cool.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:43.900
He's walking. Get out of here.
He's out of here.

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.940
Thank you very much. That will be all.

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.500
Now...

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:07.060
Are you truly interested
in management?

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:09.540
Yes, very much, sir.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:15.060
Then I suggest that you go
to the Met tonight...

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:20.060
...and end all association
with Chris Marshall.

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:22.740
At least until you're a manager.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.140
Then you can make your own rules.

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.780
I'll make sure your shift is covered.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.700
- Mari.
- What happened?

01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:48.380
- You can still be a manager, right?
- Yeah, if I break it off with Chris.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.620
Break what off? No offense,
sweetheart. What planet are you on?

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.380
You don't get it. None of you.

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.540
There was something
different about him.

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:56.900
Yeah, is called money.

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:58.980
- No, is called...
- Don't say, "love."

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.060
- Don't let her say it.
- She's going to.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.180
We connected, you know...

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.500
- I felt it. Ty felt it too.
- Snap out of it, all right?

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.380
You are not in love with this man.
He is not in love with you.

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.700
You have no connections,
affiliations or loyalties.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:14.740
You're from two different worlds.
Do you hear me?

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.020
- I hear you.
- Me too.

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.700
I don't know.

01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:21.780
Come on, Maris, you...

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.820
You could be manager!

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:26.660
Think of it, girl. One of us...

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:28.740
...out there!

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.300
In a blazer.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:32.460
Yeah.

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.500
I don't have anything
to wear to this thing.

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.220
- Honey, look, is not what you got.
- Baby, is who you know.

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:41.980
- And what they got.
- You got it?

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:45.300
When you're a manager, your first
order of business is to get us...

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:47.940
Raises!

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.460
All right, Ty, focus.

01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.020
Eyes forward.

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:15.060
Once more.
This is the Harry Winston...

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:17.820
Wreath necklace. Worth more
than I'll see in 10 lifetimes.

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.540
Good. And if it leaves her neck
at any time, you'll...

01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.900
Be put up for adoption
while my mom...

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:28.460
- Rots in prison!
- Excellent.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:34.580
- You want to say hi to Harry?
- Harry.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.740
What do you need?
Tell me what you need.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.180
Just your support, Harry.

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.460
What about a cameo
on Saturday Night Live?

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.580
- Les wait on that.
- I'm calling Lorne.

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.820
- Is nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.220
- There they are. See them?
- I see them.

01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.820
We're going to line up Maddox's
support and get Grey's endorsement.

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:02.460
Just go and get it over with.

01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.060
- Is she here?
- She'll be here. She'll be here.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:10.500
- Have fun, Ma.
- Thanks.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:14.860
Listen, be good. Go to bed when
Steph tells you. No negotiating. Okay?

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.300
Oh, God.

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:18.580
I can't breathe.

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:21.620
What am I doing here, Steph?
This is all a lie.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:24.300
No, honey.
Is more like a dream, you know?

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.660
For one night,
you're living it for all of us.

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.580
Don't think about tomorrow.
Just think about tonight.

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.580
Tonight, the maid is a lie.

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:35.860
And this, this is who you really are.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.420
What do you think?

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.060
I think we have a lot
of issues to talk about.

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:04.900
- Les get together.
- Good.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:08.420
Excuse me. I think now's
the perfect time if you'd like to...

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.940
Oh, my God, Jerry.
Look who's here.

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.980
Lovely of you,
but I don't think I'll be in town.

01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.979
I'm gonna bring him over here.

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.460
No. She should be here by now.
She's not coming.

01:08:19.620 --> 01:08:22.620
- She'll be here. She'll be here.
- She'd better be, Jerry.

01:08:58.859 --> 01:09:00.740
You're beautiful.

01:09:01.899 --> 01:09:04.020
So are you.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.819
Thank you for being here.

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:16.500
I only came to tell you that this...

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:19.580
...you and me, can't go
anywhere beyond this evening.

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.300
It just can't.

01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.340
Well, then, you shoulďve
worn a different dress.

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.060
Want to dance?

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.820
You have to listen.
I know you're used to getting your way.

01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.300
Yeah, until I met you.

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.980
There's millions of women who are
dying for you to look their way.

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.540
Yeah? Then why are you
making me work so hard?

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:11.260
Chris? Hi.
Maddox is open.

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.460
So why don't you go over,
two minutes.

01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:15.940
- Jerry. I'm here...
- I'll take over. I know.

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.860
- Oh, Chris. Hi.
- Hello.

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:27.260
- What a night. I mean, who isn't here?
- Right.

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:31.660
Do I need to know something
that I don't know already?

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:36.140
Well, that sounds like something
between you and your God, Jerry.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.420
I like a good mystery, you know.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.100
But not where his girlfriends
are concerned.

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.700
I'm not his girlfriend.

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.300
Well, whatever.
I just need him focused.

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.140
- Sorry about that.
- Not at all.

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.900
- May I cut in?
- You certainly may.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:52.980
Where were we?
Right about here, wasn't it?

01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:57.220
You better do what you're supposed
to because Jerry thinks I distract you.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:02.900
Wait, wait. Never, never start
a sentence with "Jerry thinks."

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.300
No, but you should do the right thing.

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.860
Why are you smiling?

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:15.580
Nothing, just until this minute,
I didn't know what that was.

01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:17.580
- But I do now.
- You do what?

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:19.900
- Don't go anywhere.
- Chris, I didn't mean...

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:22.940
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:45.740
Excuse me.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.860
Excuse me.
Haven't we met?

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:51.380
- I'm Caroline Lane and you're?
- Sotheby's Caroline Lane?

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.420
- Yes.
- Is wonderful to see you again.

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.580
I just knew we knew each other.
I never forget a face. Wow!

01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:00.140
Is that a Harry Winston wreath?

01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:02.980
They haven't made
that design since the late '60s.

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:05.660
You're very good.
Excuse me, I have to go.

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:08.660
Listen, just between us girls.

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:11.660
Are you here with Chris?

01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:14.020
- Can you keep a secret?
- Of course.

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:16.940
Good. So can I.

01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.980
Caroline.

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:31.660
Caroline.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.780
Caroline.

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:38.540
- Do you have somewhere else to be?
- I have to leave.

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.260
You're not leaving. You're running.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:43.300
What I can't figure out is, are you
running towards something you want?

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.860
Or are you running away from
something you're afraid to want?

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.580
Look, I've made
so many mistakes already.

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:53.940
- I just don't want to make it worse.
- You won't. I promise.

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:57.140
There's something
you don't know, okay?

01:12:57.980 --> 01:12:59.540
Oh, God. How do I tell you this?

01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:04.620
- The first time you saw me, I was...
- You were mesmerizing.

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:19.700
If tonight is all we have...

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:23.380
...stay. Please.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.980
Is over, baby.

01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:19.460
Hi, honey.

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.860
I'm good.

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:24.100
At work.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:28.740
Listen, abuela's gonna be there in about
10 minutes, and I'll be home at 6.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.300
Did you and Steph have a good time?

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.020
Yeah?

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.460
What are you gonna do in Buffalo?

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:51.700
Well, my plan is to sort of
accidentally bump into him.

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:54.940
- I mean, do you think thas too obvious?
- No.

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:02.060
- A Harry Winston wreath?
- Morning.

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:05.380
Isn't that that maid?

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:10.180
I mean, where would a maid get
that necklace? I thought maybe...

01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:13.860
I'll fast-forward through this, and you
just point her out if you see her.

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:18.740
Oh, wait, could you just
go back on that bit?

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:25.540
I mean, it could be her.

01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.180
Les just...
Can we just go forward?

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:35.620
Wait! Thas my Dolce coat!

01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:38.980
- How could you have missed that?
- I'm sorry, sir.

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.780
I'll have maintenance
get there with a plunger.

01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:47.220
And I'll call the pharmacy to see
if they have something for that.

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:52.260
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Bextrum wants
to see both of you in the Park Suite.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.260
Lionel. Marisa.

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:19.340
Oh. Well, thas interesting.
She told me her name was Maria.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:22.180
I thought it would be impolite
to correct you.

01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:25.500
And I suppose you think
is polite to steal people's clothes?

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:30.020
- I didn't steal...
- Miss Ventura, Mr. Bextrum has spent...

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.300
...30 minutes trying to persuade
Miss Lane not to press charges.

01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.580
I suggest you say as little as possible.

01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:37.500
We have it all on video.

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:39.260
Was everything returned?

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:42.900
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, Chris, I'm terribly sorry...

01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:46.260
...to interrupt you. We thought you
should know what was going on.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:48.980
- What is going on?
- The woman you thought was a guest...

01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:51.340
...on this floor is the maid on this floor.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.700
Aren't you, Marisa?

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.980
No. Wait, her name is Caroline.

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:59.100
No, Chris, darling, thas my name.
She steals clothes, identities...

01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:02.980
What the hell's happening here?
Why are you dressed that way?

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:05.980
Caroline?

01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:09.540
Is this true?

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.780
Yeah, it is.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:22.020
Jesus Christ! The press is gonna
have a field day with this one.

01:18:22.220 --> 01:18:23.980
There's no reason to involve the press.

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:26.180
How will you prevent her
from speaking?

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:28.220
This would never happen
at the Four Seasons.

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:31.300
I can assure you it has never
happened here before either.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:35.380
Lionel, you are slipping. You shoulďve
noticed something. I am disappointed.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:38.100
Please, Mr. Bextrum,
he had nothing to do with this.

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:40.660
Of course, sir. I understand.

01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:44.060
We'll talk about this later.
Miss Ventura, you no longer work here.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.060
Go to security,
hand in your passes...

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.420
...and you'll be escorted
from the building.

01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:52.540
- Yes, sir.
- Is that really necessary?

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:55.140
Chris, let the man do his job, okay?

01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:57.380
Oh, Chris.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:02.020
Oh, Chris. I can't help but feel
that this is partly my fault.

01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:04.060
It isn't. Spare yourself.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:05.820
At least let me buy you lunch.

01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:09.700
After all, we've only got each other
to get through this humiliation.

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:14.620
Caroline, the first lunch was a mistake.
A second would be complete torture.

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.060
Drinks, then?

01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:21.020
I need your nametag, passkey
and your ID card.

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:24.780
- Sorry, Marisa, but I have to.
- I understand.

01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.260
God, don't tell me
they fired you over this too.

01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:29.940
No.

01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:33.780
Actually, I made a decision
a moment ago.

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:35.780
It was long overdue.

01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.140
You quit?

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:41.220
Sometimes...

01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:46.180
...we're forced in directions that we
ought to have found for ourselves.

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:48.580
Thank you.

01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.900
Thanks, Keef. Bye.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.980
To serve people...

01:19:55.180 --> 01:19:57.700
...takes dignity and intelligence.

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:01.580
But remember,
they're only people with money.

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:06.340
And although we serve them,
we are not their servants.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:11.780
What we do, Miss Ventura,
does not define who we are.

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:17.060
What defines us is how
well we rise after falling.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.620
I think you'll make a wonderful
manager someday.

01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:30.020
And is been my great honor
to have worked with you.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.220
Marisa?

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:52.300
Marisa! Caroline! Marisa!
I don't know which name to use.

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:54.340
Marisa.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.220
I don't get it. What just happened?

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:57.980
What don't you get? I'm the maid.

01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:00.940
What was all this, some kind of bet?

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.940
A little game of what, get-the-guests?

01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.460
I was trying on her clothes,
and you were there...

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:07.740
...and you invited
me out, and everything...

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:10.460
And you thought you had to lie
to keep me interested?

01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.820
Who's kidding who here?

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.780
Think you woulďve looked at me
if you knew I was the maid?

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:15.900
- Well...
- Come on.

01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:17.900
With respect for
your big-hearted politics...

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:21.340
...I don't think so, Mr. Assemblyman.
- You didn't give me a chance.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:25.500
You stand on your soapbox, judging
everyone, so sure they're judging you.

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:27.300
And you think they're not?

01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:30.260
Come on. Half the time, I'm
a stereotype they make fun of.

01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:33.740
The other half of the time, I'm
invisible. Maybe thas the point.

01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:37.460
The first time you saw me, I was cleaning
your bathroom, only you didn't see me.

01:21:37.620 --> 01:21:40.220
Was I supposed to introduce
myself while taking a leak?

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:42.700
- You can't nail me for that.
- What are you doing?

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:43.940
Not now, Jerry. Just...

01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.540
- Go.
- You might as well sell tickets.

01:21:45.740 --> 01:21:46.980
- I don't care.
- You care.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.620
- No. No. No. No.
- Marisa.

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:53.220
I just want the truth.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:59.580
All right, you want the truth?

01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.260
There was a part of me
that wanted to see what it felt like...

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:09.220
...to have someone like you look
at me the way you did, just once.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:13.660
And I'm sorry.

01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.340
Truly.

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:18.980
If I could rewind the past week,
I would.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.740
Was any of it real?

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.940
Yeah, it was real.

01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:32.740
It was so real it made me wonder
how I was ever gonna give you up.

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:40.060
But I had to give you up.
That was the plan.

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.980
And then...

01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:47.460
Last night...

01:22:48.740 --> 01:22:50.740
...I couldn't.

01:24:37.220 --> 01:24:41.500
Rosalie from personnel called.
We expected you hours ago.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:42.860
Hi, baby.

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:44.940
She told me what happened.

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:47.820
Hey, Ma. You okay?

01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:50.020
Scoot over, let me see your homework.

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.580
I don't know what to say.

01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:54.500
What are we gonna do for dinner?
You hungry, sweetie?

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:56.700
Will you look at me?

01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:00.020
No. I'm gonna take a bath.

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:07.540
Don't, Mom.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:11.060
What were you thinking,
going out with someone like that?

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:12.700
Someone like what?

01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.940
Chris Marshall.

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:18.780
You had to pretend to be somebody
so he'd go out with you?

01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:21.820
Where is your pride, Marisa?

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.300
People like you make people
like him a God.

01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:27.380
Why, because he's rich? White?
He has things we don't have...

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.380
...that we don't want to dream about?

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:33.060
It must really burn you that I think
I have the right to go out with him.

01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:35.620
You don't.

01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:38.980
Ty, go to your room
and finish your homework, please.

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:44.260
- What happened to you?
- Don't speak to me like that.

01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:47.140
I am not the one
who lost her job today.

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:49.460
No, I did. I messed up.

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:53.580
Okay? Is all my fault. You know what?
Is all right. I'll be fine.

01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:56.180
You will because
we'll call Seńora Rodriguez.

01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:00.540
- She owes me a favor. She has...
- I'm not calling Mrs. Rodriguez.

01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:03.300
I love you, okay? I do.

01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:06.220
But I don't want to clean houses.

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.420
There's nowhere to go from there.

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:14.820
Hasn't this taught you anything? Wake
up, little girl, you have responsibilities.

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:18.260
And they come every month
like clockwork.

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:20.420
You want to end up
back in the projects?

01:26:20.620 --> 01:26:24.260
Keep dreaming dreams
that will never happen.

01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:27.740
You want to put food on the table?
Call Seńora Rodriguez.

01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:34.180
You're right, Ma.

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:36.780
I'm a good cleaning lady.

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:40.060
I'll start over.

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:42.140
But not with Mrs. Rodriguez.

01:26:44.140 --> 01:26:47.180
I'm gonna find a job
as a maid in some hotel.

01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:51.540
After some time passes, I'm gonna
apply for the management program.

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:54.500
And when I get the chance
to be a manager...

01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:58.020
And I will, Ma. I know I will.

01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.820
I'm going to take
that chance without any fear.

01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:04.580
Without your voice
in my head telling me that I can't.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.140
Did you see this?

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:14.500
- How did it start?
- Did he know you were a maid?

01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:17.380
- Are you a Beresford perk?
- How long were you involved?

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:18.820
How did they find you out?

01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:21.300
Any advice to other maids
looking to trade up?

01:27:21.460 --> 01:27:24.060
- Did Democrats put you up to this?
- Does he tip well?

01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:26.340
Is it true you're booked
on Larry King Live?

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:28.900
I'm at the Beresford Hotel,
where yesterday...

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:32.740
...Senate hopeful Chris Marshall was
captured on video in a lovers' spat...

01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:35.700
...with a woman now identified
as a hotel maid.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:37.340
Who's kidding who here?

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.380
Think you woulďve looked
at me if you knew I was the maid?

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:42.660
- With respect...
- Oh, shit.

01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:44.940
Oh, my God.

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.580
We won't...
We will not be answering...

01:27:47.740 --> 01:27:50.460
We will not be taking
any questions right now.

01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:53.460
Mr. Marshall will make a statement.

01:27:58.260 --> 01:27:59.940
Morning.

01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:02.140
I'd like to make a short statement.

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.860
And it will be all
that I have to say about this...

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:09.220
This invasion of my privacy.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:14.260
I happened to meet
Miss Ventura and her son...

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:20.140
...during my stay
at a hotel in New York.

01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.300
And we became friends.

01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:29.620
There are people from all walks
of life who I count as friends.

01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:33.540
And my only regret in this instance
is that one of them, Miss Ventura...

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:39.300
...was subjected to the scrutiny
and innuendo of the media...

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:43.020
...as a result of that friendship with me.

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:55.980
I need these numbers
to be plus 10 percent.

01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:18.980
Welcome to the employee cafeteria.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:24.540
Is open 24 hours a day...

01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.780
Please.

01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:45.860
Is today the 19th?

01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:48.100
Six more shopping days.

01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:49.820
He's here. He's back!

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:53.940
- Who? What are you reading?
- Yesterday's paper. Chris is in town.

01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.420
So? Go put your clothes on.
Is late.

01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:58.860
So? He's giving a press conference.
Guess where?

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:02.500
I don't care. Okay? Come on.
Put your turtleneck on too. Is cold.

01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:04.140
At your hotel.

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:05.420
- Ma!
- What?

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:06.660
At your hotel!

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.900
I heard you, bubba!

01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:12.860
Don't you think is weird?
You'll be there, he'll be there.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.380
So will a thousand other people.
We talked about this.

01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:18.900
You have your
turtleneck on backwards.

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:20.740
I thought we talked about this.

01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.820
I know, but is like fate.

01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:27.420
No, is like New York City
and an available conference room.

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:29.220
You knew, didn't you?

01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:32.300
You weren't gonna tell me.
You knew he was coming.

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:36.380
Remember, bubba, what I told you?
We talked about this.

01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:40.660
He's not part of our lives,
but we wish him luck with his, right?

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.820
You think he misses us?

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:50.420
Well, he'd be crazy not to.

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:15.660
Mr. Marshall, if elected,
you'll be the third Marshall...

01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:18.820
...to serve New York in the Senate.
How does it feel?

01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:21.220
If I get elected, I'll let you know.

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:24.820
Did your father
leave you any advice?

01:31:24.980 --> 01:31:28.220
Yeah, he said, "Don't run."

01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:31.460
We have time
for one more question, folks.

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:33.980
Then we have
a meet-and-greet in the Green Room.

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:36.020
I have a question.

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:41.660
- What? Who said that?
- Mr. Marshall, down here.

01:31:42.980 --> 01:31:44.380
Sure.

01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:46.820
Whas your question?

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.340
I was wondering...

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:52.660
- Chris, don't do this.
- No. Wait. I'm listening. Go ahead.

01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:53.860
Well...

01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:57.500
I know everyone makes mistakes.

01:31:57.660 --> 01:32:01.980
And is a sign of character to give
a person a second chance, right?

01:32:02.140 --> 01:32:04.740
Right. I'm with you.

01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:09.940
Even if someone lied,
they should be forgiven.

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:13.220
Otherwise, we'd never have
any congressmen or presidents.

01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:17.340
Thanks very much.
We have to wrap this up.

01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.900
Jerry, he's not done. Go on.

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:25.460
Well, what if you're not a politician
trying to do good for everybody?

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:28.860
What if you're just a regular person,
like a maid or something?

01:32:30.940 --> 01:32:33.460
And she made a mistake.

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.380
Do you think she should
get a second chance?

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.300
I mean, nobody's perfect, right?

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.660
No. Nobody's perfect.

01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:46.740
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
take a look at a future candidate.

01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:51.140
All right, thanks very much, folks.
We'll see you all in Buffalo.

01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:56.340
- Don't do this. Don't throw it all...
- I'm just trusting my instincts here.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:02.300
- Great speech.
- Really?

01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:05.020
- Eating out of your hands.
- Thanks.

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:11.300
Cool.

01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:14.180
Where is she?

01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:18.020
This way!

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:30.140
- Have you seen Marisa Ventura?
- No, I haven't seen Marisa.

01:33:45.940 --> 01:33:47.980
We haven't had this
kind of story in a while.

01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.220
It will kill his career.

01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:51.980
Will this hurt your
announcement for senator?

01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:57.340
Mr. Marshall, are you still seeing her?
Was it love at first sight, Mr. Marshall?

01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:00.480
- Marisa?
- Hey, Ma.

01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:01.700
- Marisa?
- Hey, Ma.

01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:06.700
Ty? What are you both
doing down here? Whas...?

01:34:18.380 --> 01:34:20.060
Hello.

01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:25.380
Look...

01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:29.140
Can we start over?

01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.660
Second chance, second date?

01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:34.060
You as you, me as me.

01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.340
No secrets.

01:34:37.140 --> 01:34:38.820
What do you think?

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:43.380
- We know you're in there!
- Open up! Only one way out.

01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.420
Marisa Ventura.

01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.020
Housekeeping.

01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:03.460
Chris Marshall. Candidate for Senate.

01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:05.500
I'd appreciate your vote.

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:08.700
We'll see.

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.940
We're in!

01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.180
Mr. Marshall, over here!

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:17.260
Mr. Marshall.

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.740
Mira.

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:30.420
Esa es mi hija.

01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:32.740
Whas your relationship...

01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:36.500
...with the Latin community?
- Excellent. He speaks Latin... Spanish.

01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:42.420
Miss Ventura, will you
clean up the Senate?

01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:46.700
What do you think, sir?
You two got a chance? Sir?

01:35:47.305 --> 01:35:53.333
