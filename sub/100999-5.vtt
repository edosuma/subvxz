00:00.167 --> 00:01.501
Previously on Condor...

00:01.718 --> 00:02.949
Why are you spending
so much time with Gordon?

00:02.973 --> 00:05.273
I like him.
He's a nice guy.

00:05.319 --> 00:07.058
I know you too well to believe that.

00:07.092 --> 00:08.302
I am sorry...I'm sorry

00:08.327 --> 00:11.373
Pull up a chair.
The breakfast was Piper's.

00:11.537 --> 00:13.326
We are about to run out of money.

00:13.351 --> 00:14.663
I'll get the money.

00:15.083 --> 00:17.918
Down! Drop the gun!
Drop the weapons!

00:18.083 --> 00:20.097
I sent a SWAT team
to Reuel Abbott's house.

00:20.122 --> 00:21.239
What?

00:21.417 --> 00:23.127
He threatened me and my family.

00:23.151 --> 00:24.401
Reuel Abbott?

00:25.268 --> 00:27.292
Talk to Sidney Thrush.

00:27.346 --> 00:29.459
Vasili Sirin jumped.

00:29.564 --> 00:32.134
He reportedly knew
Volk's agent in the CIA.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.985
I was going to be killed.

00:34.009 --> 00:36.009
Now we're both dead.

00:36.157 --> 00:40.016
We should have a plan to
meet up on the other side.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.750
Union Station.
Track 11.

00:42.314 --> 00:43.907
Everyone has something to hide.

00:43.932 --> 00:46.556
As long as you don't hide Sirin.

00:46.724 --> 00:50.417
You got Gordon served to you by
a single source inside the SVR

00:50.442 --> 00:53.459
whose identity is known only to you.

00:53.584 --> 00:55.521
Maybe you were the one
who was approached.

00:55.545 --> 00:57.545
Gordon fits the mold of a double agent.

00:57.709 --> 01:01.250
Career stalled out
money problems, marital problems

01:01.417 --> 01:04.042
That is exactly why they would set him up.

01:04.209 --> 01:06.466
Fuck, man. You really
came through for me.

01:08.380 --> 01:09.642
To you, my friend.

01:09.667 --> 01:13.167
You said something to me at the hospital.

01:13.334 --> 01:16.000
I asked you to kill the men
that killed your uncle

03:13.732 --> 03:18.471
I work a lot so it's just
easier to crash on the couch.

03:18.541 --> 03:20.110
And my husband and I
are recently divorced...

03:20.135 --> 03:22.081
...so there's that.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.432
I'm choosing to trust you, Joe.

03:26.987 --> 03:27.690
Okay.

03:27.768 --> 03:31.959
I have an asset inside
the SVR's DC rezidentsiya.

03:32.007 --> 03:34.350
A week ago he passed me a file

03:34.428 --> 03:38.876
indicating that Gordon Piper
was working for the Russians.

03:39.876 --> 03:42.125
Who is your asset there?

03:42.292 --> 03:44.284
The only people that know
my source exists

03:44.308 --> 03:46.308
are me, Tracy,
and now you.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.909
But the identity of my source
is only known to me.

03:49.987 --> 03:52.081
The translation's in the blue folder.

03:52.417 --> 03:56.375
Gordon met with this guy last night
and took a bunch of money from him.

03:56.501 --> 03:58.219
Who is he?
- We don't know.

03:58.243 --> 04:00.243
We had a team on him
but he lost us.

04:00.501 --> 04:04.000
Clearly knows what he's doing
which means he's probably not a civilian.

04:04.167 --> 04:05.752
I don't want to move
until we know who he is

04:05.776 --> 04:07.124
and we can't wait too long

04:07.125 --> 04:09.834
'cos once Gordon gets wind
he's under suspicion

04:09.859 --> 04:11.876
then his handlers will take
him out of the US

04:11.937 --> 04:12.679
and the next time we see him

04:12.703 --> 04:14.703
his face will be on a
Russian postage stamp.

04:17.834 --> 04:19.240
Why did you come back here?

04:19.264 --> 04:21.264
I thought you said you were
out of your element.

04:22.299 --> 04:24.440
I was. I'm non-operative,

04:24.464 --> 04:27.854
but I am a very good analyst.

04:29.071 --> 04:31.876
I mean, why do you suddenly care?

04:35.883 --> 04:39.382
I agreed to help Vasili Sirin.

04:39.501 --> 04:43.876
and so his blood is on my hands.

04:45.209 --> 04:47.375
I just need to see this through.

04:49.501 --> 04:51.099
Welcome back.

05:54.334 --> 05:59.375
You saved my life. Thank you.

05:59.501 --> 06:04.584
I saved my own life.
You just happened to be there.

06:04.751 --> 06:07.375
We have to go.

07:19.959 --> 07:21.918
I'm Tim. I'm your driver.
- Hey, Tim.

07:22.083 --> 07:26.083
- Just the one bag?
- Traveling light. I'll be right there.

07:30.501 --> 07:35.042
Hi, it's me. I'm going to be
leaving town for a while.

07:35.209 --> 07:40.250
Who knows, maybe I'll find
my way to Budapest after all.

07:40.417 --> 07:44.792
You know where the key is if you need
a place to stay. I love you.

08:17.253 --> 08:24.000
Is this your boyfriend's house?
The one I can thank for my clothes.

08:24.167 --> 08:26.834
No. Someone the
station doesn't know about.

08:27.000 --> 08:33.125
My occasional lover. A professor,
who is on sabbatical in Spain.

08:33.292 --> 08:36.626
The station knows
more than you think.

08:36.792 --> 08:42.667
I was very careful.
I have to protect my reputation.

08:42.833 --> 08:48.167
Who does your professor think you are?

08:48.334 --> 08:52.959
Richard knows me as Kathy, a
traveling pharmaceutical rep from Virginia.

08:53.125 --> 08:59.709
Peter the Great organized parties where
someone else played the role of Tsar.

08:59.876 --> 09:04.501
You may be protecting your reputation

09:04.626 --> 09:07.667
but you also enjoy acting.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.501
I am obviously very convincing.

09:10.667 --> 09:15.250
Maybe because there's a grain
of truth in your performance.

09:17.209 --> 09:20.375
If you're trying to prove
that I still care about you...

09:20.501 --> 09:24.042
the fact that you're still alive
should be enough.

09:24.209 --> 09:28.292
But if I was taken in,
I would be foolish

09:28.459 --> 09:32.876
and you know I'm not a fool.

09:34.292 --> 09:40.584
When you contact the CIA,
you must not tell them that I helped you.

09:41.792 --> 09:45.167
I would like one more favour.

09:48.209 --> 09:51.802
I had a date with someone...
Who?

09:52.232 --> 09:53.208
A friend

09:53.209 --> 09:54.974
Does your friend work for the CIA?

09:57.669 --> 09:58.919
Not anymore.

10:07.375 --> 10:09.626
Shit!

10:09.792 --> 10:12.213
Want to take a shower with me?

10:12.635 --> 10:15.463
I showered last night.

10:16.125 --> 10:19.459
What?
- I showered last night.

10:19.584 --> 10:24.375
You don't know what you're missing out on.
- I'm sure I've got a pretty good idea.

10:25.395 --> 10:29.959
Good morning.
- Morning.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.039
Did you get any sleep?

10:32.063 --> 10:34.063
No

10:35.336 --> 10:37.023
But I think I figured something out.

10:38.083 --> 10:43.250
I need coffee first. Do you want some?
- Yeah, thanks.

10:51.459 --> 10:52.459
Hey...

10:52.711 --> 10:57.419
Where did you sleep last night?
- I'm sorry, I should have called.

10:57.505 --> 11:00.046
Milk and sugar?
- Just black, thank you.

11:00.292 --> 11:04.417
-Did you meet someone?
Can we talk about this later?

11:04.542 --> 11:07.642
Yes, we are definitely talking
about this later.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.666
Okay, bye.

11:15.959 --> 11:19.667
Why are you in such a good mood?
- I am taking a sick day.

11:21.167 --> 11:25.042
Are you feeling okay?
- I feel incredible.

11:25.209 --> 11:27.044
You should call in sick, too.
We can play hookey.

11:27.068 --> 11:28.500
I have a meeting.

11:28.501 --> 11:32.501
Well, reschedule.
- Jesus, Gordon. Come on, stop it...

11:32.626 --> 11:37.209
Let's get a hotel suite,
order room service..

11:37.375 --> 11:41.000
And fuck and drink and eat and fuck.
What do you say?

11:41.167 --> 11:45.409
I say that we can't afford a hotel suite.

11:45.433 --> 11:46.229
Yes we can.

11:46.254 --> 11:50.042
And as the person in this household
most familiar with our personal finances...

11:50.209 --> 11:52.626
I got a little money.

11:53.969 --> 11:57.375
How much is a little money?
How much... a lot.

11:57.501 --> 12:00.959
You just said a little.
- Size is relative...

12:02.083 --> 12:04.129
Where did this money come from, Gordon?

12:04.590 --> 12:08.723
It's kind of like an advance
for my new job.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.359
You're leaving the agency?
- Yeah.

12:13.501 --> 12:16.375
When did you decide this?
- Oh God, I've wanted to for years.

12:16.501 --> 12:19.899
I was just afraid to hop off my lily pad

12:19.915 --> 12:21.508
without knowing where I
was going to land first.

12:21.834 --> 12:24.334
And where are you landing?
Where are we landing?

12:24.501 --> 12:26.782
I don't want to bore you with the
details right now. Come on

12:26.798 --> 12:28.865
Gordon, I don't find details boring.

12:29.250 --> 12:32.876
Remember what I said about you trusting me?

12:47.327 --> 12:51.608
Hi, Arlene.I need to move today's meeting.

12:51.624 --> 12:53.304
I'm taking a day off.

12:56.131 --> 12:59.083
Okay. Let's see what you got.

13:08.459 --> 13:11.130
That is a surveillance photo
I've seen it before.

13:11.155 --> 13:15.334
Yeah, so have I. In Bob's office
the morning I was attacked.

13:17.417 --> 13:20.501
Okay. What's your theory?

13:26.873 --> 13:28.388
What happened to your lip?

13:28.763 --> 13:30.123
I cut it shaving.

13:31.083 --> 13:34.542
When did you start shaving?
- I don't know.. a couple of months ago.

13:34.717 --> 13:37.509
Who taught you?
- I found a video on YouTube,

13:37.667 --> 13:39.409
You can learn a lot online.

13:39.433 --> 13:41.620
Yeah, there's also a lot of things
on there that aren't true

13:44.971 --> 13:48.083
Do you ever read any of
the stuff about Dad?

13:49.709 --> 13:54.417
I think it would be too painful.
I don't know if I want to know.

13:54.542 --> 13:58.209
I'd like to preserve what good memories
I still have left of your father.

13:58.375 --> 14:02.292
Yeah. Once you've been down that
route it's a hard thing to do.

14:02.459 --> 14:05.083
But at least I'm not living a lie.

14:06.736 --> 14:10.918
You think I'm living a lie?
- I was just talking about me.

14:11.744 --> 14:13.459
I'm going go get ready for school.

14:50.501 --> 14:52.188
Fuck!

14:55.529 --> 15:00.375
No no no no no!
That is bullshit!

15:05.974 --> 15:08.451
Saved by the bell.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.341
I prefer not to make my big comeback.

15:10.667 --> 15:12.876
Grab your stuff.

15:19.584 --> 15:21.810
I'll just grab my things.
- Great.

15:21.873 --> 15:24.232
Can I get you a coffee? Pop-Tart?

15:24.311 --> 15:25.991
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

15:26.802 --> 15:28.918
Don't forget your boots.
- Okay!

15:30.834 --> 15:32.185
Are you going somewhere
this weekend?

15:32.272 --> 15:34.472
Cal is taking him camping.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.451
Yeah? Just the two of them?

15:37.375 --> 15:40.709
No, they're going with some of
Cal's friends and their sons.

15:42.610 --> 15:45.149
Cal and I have been married for  10 years.

15:45.149 --> 15:46.735
Cal is like a second father to him.

15:46.760 --> 15:47.853
Yeah. No, of course.

15:48.791 --> 15:51.455
Hey! You're going camping...
- Yeah

15:51.584 --> 15:54.271
Have fun and be safe, eh?
Okay. Bye, dad.

15:54.295 --> 15:57.021
Love you, Bye.
- Bye

16:49.584 --> 16:54.334
Hey. Missed anything?
- Piper's taking the day off.

16:55.501 --> 16:58.876
Anything else?
He showed up last night.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.022
Changed his mind - wants to help.
- Help how?

17:02.346 --> 17:04.212
He's going over the files.

17:04.334 --> 17:08.278
Is that a good idea?
-You might think so.

17:08.426 --> 17:11.626
He's taking your side.
- What's my side?

17:11.651 --> 17:14.834
He thinks Gordon's been set up.

17:27.791 --> 17:29.870
It's the same photo.
From Bob's office.

17:29.894 --> 17:30.963
You're sure

17:31.159 --> 17:32.401
I assumed that the file was Bob's

17:32.426 --> 17:35.440
and that the Russians were trying to
make it disappear to protect their mole

17:35.487 --> 17:38.000
but what if...?
- It was put there as a plant

17:38.167 --> 17:40.417
In the hopes that someone
would eventually find it

17:40.425 --> 17:42.685
to falsely frame Gordon as the mole.
- Yes.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.751
The only question would be how
no-one else found it before I did.

17:45.918 --> 17:47.646
That's hardly the only question.

17:47.904 --> 17:50.185
So your source set you up?

17:50.584 --> 17:52.318
Or he was used.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.627
I have a stupid question.

17:54.636 --> 17:58.028
Why couldn't the Russians and
Bob have the same photo?

17:58.167 --> 18:00.751
Maybe Bob had his own
source inside the SVR.

18:00.918 --> 18:02.800
If it was leaked to you, why
couldn't it be leaked to him?

18:02.816 --> 18:03.856
Right. Err...

18:05.991 --> 18:10.667
You okay?
- Yeah. It only hurts when I think.

18:10.731 --> 18:15.250
Look, I would love to believe all of this.

18:15.417 --> 18:16.870
And up until last night when
Gordon took the money

18:16.894 --> 18:19.104
I thought he was being set up.

18:19.979 --> 18:24.160
And you can plant fake files but how do you
make an innocent man take a pay-off?

18:25.027 --> 18:27.175
Taking money isn't the same as treason.

18:27.230 --> 18:31.262
We still don't know what the money's
for or who gave it to him.

18:31.584 --> 18:35.292
I'm going to set up a meet with my
source and find out what he knows.

19:27.334 --> 19:33.042
You've been a naughty girl.
- What evil deed has come to light?

19:33.209 --> 19:35.876
You and Volk never came
back yesterday.

19:36.260 --> 19:40.448
He has been watching you since you arrived.
- We ran a case yesterday.

19:40.501 --> 19:43.878
What case?
- The kind you don't talk about.

19:44.667 --> 19:48.250
Where did you go afterwards?
-Home to my place.

19:48.417 --> 19:53.542
Did you invite him in?
- He invited himself.

19:58.834 --> 20:02.459
I'd fuck him.
He's handsome.

20:02.584 --> 20:07.375
But maybe you are looking for someone else?
- Or maybe I'm not gossiping.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.167
I knew it.

20:16.959 --> 20:19.626
I am glad you called.
- Me too.

20:19.792 --> 20:22.626
This is a beautiful home.
-Thank you.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.083
It's not at all what I was expecting.

20:25.250 --> 20:29.501
Really? So what were you expecting?

20:29.626 --> 20:33.000
Modern American government salary.

20:36.626 --> 20:39.626
Did you come from money?

20:39.792 --> 20:43.222
You know, I really love the
way that you just

20:43.245 --> 20:45.727
say anything that comes
into your mind.

20:45.751 --> 20:48.501
I don't know any other way.
- Okay

20:48.626 --> 20:54.344
Well, yes.
I inherited a lot of money. Yes.

20:54.369 --> 20:57.959
Since we began dating I've been reading
a lot about the history of the CIA.

20:58.125 --> 21:02.000
How they would recruit people
from elite families.

21:02.167 --> 21:04.000
Are we dating?

21:04.167 --> 21:09.542
Would you like us to be dating?
- Yes.

21:18.959 --> 21:23.042
What are you doing?
-Rico.

21:23.209 --> 21:25.667
Who is Rico?
-Rico.

21:25.834 --> 21:27.709
I have no idea who you're talking about.

21:27.725 --> 21:30.733
- The bartender from our honeymoon.
C'mon. Rico.

21:30.918 --> 21:34.959
Come on!
You're so making this up!

21:35.125 --> 21:37.265
Y'know, I don't like to be too
critical of your bad memory because...

21:37.281 --> 21:39.189
it's one of my favourite
things about you...

21:39.213 --> 21:40.458
It serves me so well

21:40.459 --> 21:44.167
But it's a little worrisome at times.
- Fuck you...

21:44.334 --> 21:47.787
He tended the bar at that
shack on the beach.

21:47.865 --> 21:50.537
There's a photo of him in
our wedding album.

21:50.568 --> 21:53.083
Now I know you're lying.
- Okay, where is the wedding album?

21:53.233 --> 21:54.522
I've no idea.

21:54.483 --> 21:57.189
What, now you have no idea
where wedding album is?

21:57.268 --> 22:00.096
That thing should be in
a climate-controlled vault

22:00.127 --> 22:02.101
with a state-of-the-art alarm system.

22:02.125 --> 22:05.436
It is. But the location is unknown.

22:05.468 --> 22:06.468
Even to us.

22:07.667 --> 22:11.501
Rico! Okay. That's enough.

22:11.626 --> 22:15.459
Maybe you were on your honeymoon
with your other wife.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.918
There's only ever been you.

22:19.599 --> 22:23.876
Yeah. Try this on.

22:28.393 --> 22:31.584
It's true, you know.
- What is?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.805
There's only ever been you.

22:35.977 --> 22:37.584
I know.

22:39.250 --> 22:41.249
Thanks.

22:42.093 --> 22:46.167
You already know
I feel the exact same way

22:47.669 --> 22:52.459
Thank you for staying home with me
for no good reason than that I asked you to

22:52.934 --> 22:55.375
You also know that I cannot
say no to you, Gordon

22:55.473 --> 22:57.834
Well, cheers to that.

23:01.501 --> 23:04.376
If just wish I knew
what we are celebrating.

23:07.459 --> 23:10.209
Everything.
All of it.

23:10.375 --> 23:12.580
We were so young when we got married.

23:12.605 --> 23:15.011
You know what a colossal fucking
mistake that could have been?

23:15.042 --> 23:17.334
Yeah, my mother certainly made the case.

23:17.501 --> 23:20.709
But your mother was wrong.
It was the exact right thing to do.

23:20.876 --> 23:23.167
Somehow we both knew it.

23:23.334 --> 23:28.417
Somewhere deep inside where
you know things before you know them.

23:30.125 --> 23:32.667
I have so many regrets

23:32.834 --> 23:38.459
but none of them are on the same
continent as you and the kids.

23:41.125 --> 23:45.918
I'm sorry. I better shut up.
- No no.

23:47.709 --> 23:50.125
Come here.

23:50.292 --> 23:53.125
I love you so much.

24:00.501 --> 24:03.167
I'll do something just for you, baby.

24:18.709 --> 24:21.865
I'm have to head out for a couple of hours.
- Okay

24:21.951 --> 24:23.908
Keep an eye on encyclopaedia ??

24:24.417 --> 24:27.834
Make sure he doesn't eat
your pad Thai leftovers.

24:52.584 --> 24:55.626
Dance with me.
-No, I have two left feet.

24:55.792 --> 24:57.427
I don't believe that for a second.

24:57.433 --> 25:00.889
Come on. This way we can break the ice
instead of going straight to kissing.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.911
Can I put my hand this way?

25:13.927 --> 25:15.607
That's good.
- Thank you.

25:46.083 --> 25:47.590
What is that?

25:55.751 --> 25:59.000
Shall we go see?

26:01.626 --> 26:05.501
It's a songbird.
He's confused. He thinks he's outside.

26:05.667 --> 26:07.417
What do we do?

26:10.501 --> 26:11.962
Is it dead?

26:30.918 --> 26:33.167
I'm hungry.

26:33.334 --> 26:35.342
How do you feed yourself?

26:35.365 --> 26:37.765
I'm pretty handy with a microwave.

26:37.925 --> 26:39.348
We're going to the supermarket.

26:39.371 --> 26:41.971
I'm making you lunch.
And maybe dinner.

26:42.751 --> 26:47.000
The reason rumors have persisted about
the near-plague epidemic of 2018...

26:47.167 --> 26:52.167
...is the Special Commission's report
exonerating the CIA was..well..unconvincing

26:52.334 --> 26:54.216
We are expected to believe
that nobody above

26:54.255 --> 26:56.623
middle management was
involved in this thing

26:56.667 --> 26:59.542
Not to mention anyone lucky
enough to still be alive.

26:59.709 --> 27:01.145
Shall we examine the body count?

27:01.159 --> 27:02.839
Elden Loramer, CIA. Dead.

27:04.071 --> 27:07.253
His wife Iris. Dead.

27:07.278 --> 27:10.575
Sam Barber, CIA. Dead.

27:10.751 --> 27:13.375
Marty Frost, retired CIA. Dead.

27:13.501 --> 27:16.501
Gareth Minor, White Sands CEO. Dead.

27:16.667 --> 27:19.667
Caleb Wolfe,
Information activist. Dead.

27:19.834 --> 27:24.584
And let’s not forget the 11 dead
CIA analysts in Georgetown.

28:01.501 --> 28:05.876
Oh my God!
You scared the shit out of me!

28:06.042 --> 28:09.459
Sorry to scare you. I am so sorry.
I didn't think you were home.

28:09.584 --> 28:14.250
No, no, no. it's my fault.
It's Thursday. I'm Sorry.

28:14.417 --> 28:19.501
I think I need to get out of the house.
I was feeling all cooped-up.

28:19.667 --> 28:24.209
You're out of detergent.
-Okay. I'll get some.

28:47.250 --> 28:48.876
Thanks.

29:29.167 --> 29:30.480
Are you hungry?.

29:30.519 --> 29:35.682
-What? Yeah

29:37.916 --> 29:43.959
We use reflective surfaces.
Windows, puddles, cars.

29:44.125 --> 29:46.709
It's the part of the brain that
never stops working.

29:46.876 --> 29:49.626
It is always uneasy, searching, scanning.

29:49.792 --> 29:52.000
When I was a young man
it was drilled into me

29:52.167 --> 29:56.584
that if I lowered my defenses,
I might die - or worse.

29:56.751 --> 29:59.584
It's what we call "tradecraft"

29:59.751 --> 30:03.165
So, when you're driving...

30:03.204 --> 30:07.918
...are you checking to see if you're being
- what's the word? - tailed?

30:08.083 --> 30:10.459
If I'm driving or walking uh huh.

30:10.584 --> 30:13.412
Have you ever spotted a tail?

30:13.553 --> 30:14.993
Not in decades.

30:16.209 --> 30:21.375
But you have spotted them? These tails?
- Yes, many times.

30:23.834 --> 30:27.318
Are you just trying to turn me on?
-Is it working?

30:28.459 --> 30:30.751
I hope so.

30:32.083 --> 30:33.864
I want to believe that
Gordon is innocent, but...

30:33.864 --> 30:36.262
...it's getting really difficult.

30:36.974 --> 30:38.647
I've been where you are.

30:38.740 --> 30:42.966
Facing a possibility that a
good friend is a traitor.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.122
You know someone for as
long as I've known Gordon

30:46.177 --> 30:48.567
you believe what your eyes see,
trust your own judgment

30:48.591 --> 30:51.305
Which is not always easy

30:51.349 --> 30:54.544
when you feel like you've missed
something sitting right in front of you

30:55.834 --> 31:00.209
Are you talking about Sam Barber?
-Yeah.

31:01.375 --> 31:06.292
You two are close, huh?
- Yeah, he was my best friend.

31:10.459 --> 31:12.826
It's a weird feeling
I'm dating Mae

31:14.751 --> 31:19.086
No. I'm happy for you both.

31:19.584 --> 31:24.375
She needed to get over Sam...

31:25.792 --> 31:28.834
...and you're good for each other.

31:30.501 --> 31:33.918
Do me a favour and
tell her that, huh?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.375
It's Eva. You know what to do.

31:38.501 --> 31:39.914
Hey, it's Mae.

31:40.124 --> 31:43.726
I thought about your offer and I
don't want to pursue it.

31:44.187 --> 31:45.992
I need to try and get past this.

31:46.139 --> 31:51.515
I think talking to Senator Thrush would
just reopen old wounds at this point...

31:52.083 --> 31:57.709
Thanks anyway.
I really appreciate it. Bye.

32:46.501 --> 32:49.083
It's Eva.
You know what to do.

32:49.250 --> 32:52.709
It's me again.
Forget my last message.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.876
The ambulance.
- What ambulance?

33:31.933 --> 33:35.083
How'd they get it?
- How'd who get it?

33:38.717 --> 33:40.279
You need to set up a database..

33:40.310 --> 33:42.193
...stolen ambulances and
ambulance rentals

33:42.193 --> 33:45.969
in DC, Maryland, Virginia,
West Virginia and the Carolinas.

33:48.501 --> 33:50.584
Do it now.

33:51.709 --> 33:55.918
You all right?
- Yeah. It's just a headache.

33:56.083 --> 33:58.417
When was the last time you got some sleep?

33:58.558 --> 34:02.433
It's been a while. I could probably
do with a nap but I'm fine.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.237
I'll drop you off at Mae's.
You can get some rest.

34:04.253 --> 34:06.253
I'll call you if we get a hit.
- Fine

34:49.333 --> 34:51.501
I'm going home.

35:09.959 --> 35:12.834
Where are you trying to sneak in?

35:16.292 --> 35:23.042
I'm going home to sleep.
Someone was watching me yesterday.

35:23.209 --> 35:27.125
Do you want to keep me company?
- I have a meeting.

35:27.292 --> 35:31.709
It's your loss.
- Maybe I'll come later.

35:31.876 --> 35:34.918
Maybe I'll already be asleep.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.584
I can't do this anymore.

36:11.751 --> 36:17.125
I don't feel safe. I can't sleep
at night. I feel like they know.

36:17.299 --> 36:19.894
You are safe Not even my own
people know who you are.

36:19.933 --> 36:21.866
It's not your people that
I'm worried about.

36:24.596 --> 36:26.784
Surely I have repaid
my debt to you by now.

36:26.959 --> 36:30.501
We can cool it off for a couple of weeks.
- No, I can't...

36:30.626 --> 36:34.292
I didn't put you in
this situation, Polina.

36:36.584 --> 36:39.751
I'm scared.

36:39.918 --> 36:44.709
Here. You look cold.
This'll warm you up.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.667
Now tell me...
do you know who this is?

37:11.432 --> 37:15.292
The guy who made the pay-off to Piper
was Lior Lishkott. He's ex-Mossad.

37:15.459 --> 37:18.959
He has his own private security
company in Tyson's Corner.

37:19.125 --> 37:22.349
Okay. Maybe Gordon's going to work for him
in the private sector and that was just...

37:22.375 --> 37:24.175
...advancing him some cash.

37:24.287 --> 37:26.685
The Israelis couldn't prove
it but they suspected

37:26.685 --> 37:29.285
that Lishkott was
doubling for the SVR.

37:29.501 --> 37:32.375
So they shit Candon for it.

37:33.709 --> 37:37.918
I got a warrant and the FBI wants...
- Wait.

37:38.083 --> 37:42.626
C'mon, Tracy. Gordon took money
from a Russian intelligence agent.

37:42.792 --> 37:46.918
No more waiting.
- I agree...

37:48.334 --> 37:50.542
Would you do me a favour?

37:52.250 --> 37:54.417
There you go. See?

37:54.542 --> 37:58.375
Who's that?
- That, son, is Rico.

37:58.501 --> 38:04.459
That is so weird, seeing yourself in a
photograph you do not remember taking.

38:04.584 --> 38:06.125
Pizza's here.

38:13.334 --> 38:15.792
Hey. This is a surprise.
Come on in.

38:15.959 --> 38:18.501
I'm here for work.
- What does that mean?

38:18.665 --> 38:21.025
I asked them to let me be the
one to come and get you.

38:21.050 --> 38:22.170
You asked who?

38:23.334 --> 38:26.667
I thought it would be less
invasive, less embarrassing.

38:26.834 --> 38:30.042
What the fuck are you talking about?
– Lior Lishkott.

38:33.083 --> 38:35.706
What about him?
- You took money from him.

38:35.761 --> 38:39.667
I can explain that.
- Yeah, you'll get a chance to.

38:39.834 --> 38:44.459
He offered me a job.
- You have a job. At least you had one.

38:46.083 --> 38:50.292
Are you fucking serious?
- You think I'd joke about this

39:01.579 --> 39:04.318
Oh, yeah, that was in the winter last...

39:04.501 --> 39:08.042
We were hiking.
- You've got your dad's eyes.

39:11.167 --> 39:14.918
I have to go. It's work.

39:15.083 --> 39:19.876
I'll see you... I'm not sure...

39:20.042 --> 39:21.417
Gordon?
- Yup.

39:21.542 --> 39:26.334
Gordon. What is going on?

39:31.042 --> 39:36.000
They want to ask me some questions.
- Who wants to ask you some questions?

39:38.918 --> 39:41.542
About the money.

39:42.501 --> 39:46.918
Tracy, what is going on?
- Don't ask him. He's not here as a friend.

39:47.083 --> 39:51.375
Come here. Look, it's gonna be okay.

39:53.125 --> 39:54.953
What did you do, Gordon?

39:55.468 --> 39:58.208
Gordon, what the fuck did you do?

39:58.375 --> 40:00.751
Don't fucking touch me, man.
- Tracy, what...

40:18.584 --> 40:22.459
You did this to yourself
- Fuck you!

40:29.876 --> 40:31.876
You did that to yourself, too.

41:50.250 --> 41:52.492
What the hell happened to you
earlier? I waited an hour.

41:52.523 --> 41:53.643
I was followed.

41:53.667 --> 41:56.918
By whom?
- The Americans.

41:57.083 --> 42:01.209
They were at the marina when I
met with Piper. What's going on?

42:01.375 --> 42:03.292
Did you lose them?
- Eventually.

42:03.459 --> 42:07.375
Did you use me to set Piper up?
- Yes.

42:07.672 --> 42:08.626
Why didn't you tell me?

42:08.649 --> 42:12.105
It wasn't of operational significance
for you to know.

42:14.501 --> 42:17.068
You are going to have to
go away for a while.

42:17.068 --> 42:17.976
Fuck.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.336
The Americans will be looking for you.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.453
What am I supposed
to tell my wife?

42:24.334 --> 42:26.876
How long do I have to go away for?

43:08.250 --> 43:10.501
I was trying to get in touch with you.

43:10.667 --> 43:16.167
Sorry. I couldn't get away until now.
Is it safe to talk?

43:16.334 --> 43:19.459
Yeah. We're alone.

43:19.584 --> 43:21.501
Is your arm okay?
- Yeah, I'm gonna live.

43:21.626 --> 43:25.083
Two of my guys didn't make it.
You know that? They have families.

43:25.250 --> 43:27.009
They'll be taken care of.
There's an Agency slush fund.

43:27.017 --> 43:29.683
That was a very dirty job,
even for the Agency.

43:29.751 --> 43:33.667
We need to stay focused and
just wipe everything down.

43:33.849 --> 43:36.006
Where did you get the ambulance?
- Rented it.

43:36.029 --> 43:39.293
You rented it?
- I told them we were making a movie.

43:39.501 --> 43:42.306
Did you use your real name?
- You said to go fast.

43:42.329 --> 43:44.376
It was too fast.
I told you that.

43:44.626 --> 43:46.829
And that boy of yours,
he had real skills

43:46.853 --> 43:49.142
You said it was an easy job.
That was not an easy job.

43:49.167 --> 43:52.584
I got bad intel.
- Who the fuck was that guy?

43:53.959 --> 43:56.375
Russian intelligence officer.

43:58.834 --> 44:02.834
Your friend. The one who's alive.
- Letts.

44:03.000 --> 44:07.542
Do you trust him?
Is he gonna tell anyone my name?

44:07.709 --> 44:10.250
He doesn't know your name.
