02:35.823 --> 02:39.558
<i> One. Which we did.</i>
<i> All right? We did that.</i>

02:39.560 --> 02:41.627
[man 1] <i> Do not think about...</i>

02:41.629 --> 02:43.462
[man 2] <i> And yeah,</i>
<i> I didn't think about...</i>

02:43.464 --> 02:45.931
[man 1] <i> He might come home!</i>

02:47.835 --> 02:50.119
<i> I mean, you just casually</i>
<i> walked upstairs</i>

02:50.120 --> 02:52.404

02:52.406 --> 02:55.407
[men arguing indistinctly on TV]

03:02.550 --> 03:04.583
<i> Because you're stomping around</i>

03:04.584 --> 03:06.617

[telephone solicitors

03:42.489 --> 03:44.489
[woman] Great, we'll put you
down for three.

03:44.491 --> 03:47.492
Uh-huh. Thank you so much.
I got another one.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.328
[man] Bedrooms, bathrooms,
dungeons, you name it.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.413
Whatever you need.

03:51.414 --> 03:53.497
[man] Let me tell you about
a special promotion. Hello?

03:53.500 --> 03:56.635
I <i> will</i> go fuck myself,
thank you.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.974
Yo, take nothing personal.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.959
[man sighs]

04:03.960 --> 04:05.943
Oh, tight, dude,
you're trying to get fired?

04:05.946 --> 04:08.130
Cool.

04:08.131 --> 04:10.315
[man] All right, this is where
all the magic happens.

04:10.317 --> 04:13.352
The main floor,
the headquarters.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.988
Let's say hi to, um,
Will and Martin.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.656
What's up, guys?
How you doing?

04:17.658 --> 04:19.524
Excellent decorations.
Sweet office.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.392
-Oh, sweet air.
-[guide] Let's, uh...

04:21.394 --> 04:22.995
let's keep moving.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.898
Hi, is this Rick?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.268
Hi, Rick, this is Martin
from JT Renov--

04:29.270 --> 04:31.871
Excuse me?

04:31.872 --> 04:34.473
What the fuck did you just say
to me, you little fuck boy?

04:34.475 --> 04:37.342
Listen here, Rick,
I got your address
right in front of me, dawg.

04:37.344 --> 04:40.279
Why don't I come to your house
and skull-fuck your wife
until she loves me?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.948
How would you like that?
I'll adopt your children
and make them my own.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.950
Fuck you, fuck you!

04:44.952 --> 04:46.752
I thought you said
don't take it personal.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.088
[Martin] Oh, I didn't take
that personal.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.423
No. I'm just gonna skull-fuck
his wife and raise his children.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.692
[dispenser gurgling]

04:55.763 --> 04:57.296
Cheap-ass Daniels.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.331
[man] Willie?

04:59.333 --> 05:01.867
[Will sighs] Hey, Jason.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.835
How's the tour
with the newbies going?

05:03.837 --> 05:06.705
[Jason] Have you even seen
the numbers the past month?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.740
We're running on fumes. No!

05:08.742 --> 05:12.477
Just keeps hiring more idiots
to replace the other idiots.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.646
[woman] Hey.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.814
-[Jason and Will] Hey.
-Jesus, where did you come from?

05:16.817 --> 05:18.984
I'm a ninja.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.953
Fuck, I need a cigarette.
You guys want one?

05:21.955 --> 05:24.456
I can't, they give me
the squirts.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.459
Well, thank you
for sharing that, Jason.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.860
Will?

05:30.497 --> 05:34.433
-Yeah.
-Come on.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.502
-That was gross.
-Be careful.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.570
They give you the squirts.
Hey listen, Saturday night.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.672
I'm doing a party.
It's a Halloween party.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.609
It's gonna be huge!
Tell it to your friends.

05:44.611 --> 05:47.813
I'm going to... I just did.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.617
[woman humming softly]

05:52.619 --> 05:54.986
[loud rock music on car radio]

05:54.988 --> 05:57.022
-Kelly?
-Yeah.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.395
[rock music on earbuds]

06:03.397 --> 06:05.764
[driver] Nice day today, huh?

06:06.533 --> 06:08.300
Sorry, what?

06:08.301 --> 06:10.068
I said, "Nice day today, huh?"

06:10.070 --> 06:13.438
Oh, yeah. I guess.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.607
[driver] How's it going?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.043
Fine.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.381
[driver]
You go to school around here?

06:23.851 --> 06:27.085
I bet a lot of guys
hit on you at school, huh?

06:31.492 --> 06:33.792
When everything
is said and done,

06:33.794 --> 06:38.764
I'll have... $12 left over.

06:38.766 --> 06:42.534
We could just man up and ask
Daniels for higher commission.

06:42.536 --> 06:46.037
Amber, he won't even
replace the coffee pot.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.606
The coffee pot, Amber.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.408
Point made.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.545
OK.

06:53.547 --> 06:57.115
Hey, you can still give me
a ride to work tomorrow
again, right?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.184
When are you going
to get your car back?

06:59.186 --> 07:01.953
When are you going to start
buying your own weed?

07:01.955 --> 07:05.757
[Will] Oh, great, it was
so nice to speak with you, uh...

07:05.759 --> 07:07.793
Thanks so much
for your business.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.995
You have a good day.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.097
Yes!

07:13.133 --> 07:15.067
Where's everyone going?

07:15.068 --> 07:17.002
Check your email.
Daniels is calling
a floor meeting.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.838
-[whispering stops]
-[man] Shh!

07:19.840 --> 07:23.708
You all know this year
has been less than moderate.

07:23.710 --> 07:27.779
The result had nothing to do
with your work ethic.

07:27.781 --> 07:31.049
The company is going to be
taking a new direction.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.853
Unfortunately that does mean
closing down both branches
in our district.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.722
-[employees murmuring]
-Listen. I commend all of you,

07:37.724 --> 07:40.592
all of you, for the time
you've given to the firm

07:40.594 --> 07:42.727
and I wish you all
the best of luck.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.463
So we'll finish out this week

07:44.465 --> 07:46.031
with the payroll ending
on Friday.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.567
-That's it.
-[man] He just fired us.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.602
-[man 2] I think so.
-[man 3] Oh, no!

07:50.604 --> 07:51.803
That's it!

07:51.805 --> 07:53.605
[woman 1] It's always something.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.741
[woman 2] This is awful,
what am I gonna do?

07:59.980 --> 08:04.182
-[lawnmower running]
-[squirrel chittering]

08:07.621 --> 08:10.155
-[man 1] Why do you do that?
-[man 2] Do what?

08:10.157 --> 08:13.225
[man 1] What? You always compare
our kids to Ryan and Bethann's.

08:13.227 --> 08:15.978
-[man 2] No, I don't.
-[man 1] You just did it.

08:15.979 --> 08:18.730
I just did it
in that situation because
I just think it's a good idea

08:18.732 --> 08:21.500
if Billy and Asher would
play some kind of sport.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.969
Our kids do play sports.
They play softball
and they hate it, OK?

08:23.971 --> 08:26.822
-Well--
-And it's a girly sport.

08:26.823 --> 08:29.674
It's not a girly sport,
it's the same thing as baseball,
it's just the ball is soft.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.109
It's not even soft,
it's just bigger...

08:31.111 --> 08:33.111
[man 1] I know the shape
of the ball, Marty!

08:33.113 --> 08:35.614
-[rock music playing]
-I go to the games, you don't.

08:35.615 --> 08:38.116
Softball is a good thing
for them to mingle
with other children.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.951
Sir, could you please turn
the music down?

08:39.953 --> 08:43.221
I'm trying to have
a discussion with my husband.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.056
Someone's getting one star.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.892
Great. You know what,
I'm sorry.

08:46.894 --> 08:48.905
Don't ever get married,
and if you do,

08:48.906 --> 08:50.917
don't get married to this guy
'cause he's an ass--

08:50.918 --> 08:52.929
Leave the driver out of this.
Don't bring my relationship--

08:52.933 --> 08:56.034
We're in his car!
Leave him out of it?

08:56.035 --> 08:59.136
Pay for a therapist,
don't use the ride driver
as our therapist!

08:59.139 --> 09:02.140
You are not the man
I married.

09:04.211 --> 09:08.079
Hundred bucks says Daniels
has a nice comfy chair

09:08.081 --> 09:11.182
and comfy desk just waiting
for him at the new branch.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.219
<i> You think they care about us?</i>
<i> Hell no.</i>

09:14.221 --> 09:16.187
<i> They don't care if we have</i>
<i> student loans,</i>

09:16.189 --> 09:19.157
rent to pay,
they don't give a shit.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.892
What was that that Daniels
said again?

09:20.894 --> 09:22.377
[mimicking Daniels]
"I commend you

09:22.378 --> 09:23.861
<i> on your hard work;</i>
<i> unfortunately,</i>

09:23.864 --> 09:25.664
we're a piece of shit company--"

09:25.666 --> 09:28.099
Listen, Amber...

09:28.101 --> 09:32.037
I'm just gonna say...
this is making my balls tingle,

09:32.039 --> 09:34.706
<i> but it's highly illegal.</i>

09:34.708 --> 09:37.576
The company stores a list
of every client

09:37.578 --> 09:39.110
we've done business with, right?

09:39.112 --> 09:41.346
-OK.
<i> -If I were able to get</i>

09:41.348 --> 09:42.981
a copy of the list,

09:42.983 --> 09:47.586
we could technically use
those clients ourselves.

09:47.588 --> 09:51.723
<i> I mean, we already have</i>
<i> the manufacturer's contacts</i>
<i> and they don't care</i>

09:51.725 --> 09:54.826
where the business
is coming from, just as long
as they're getting paid.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.696
We just need to set up
an LLC for the invoice.

09:57.698 --> 10:01.866
Yeah, but then we would need
to get into Daniels' computer

10:01.868 --> 10:03.935
and for that we would
need his password, so...

10:03.937 --> 10:06.271
-[Will groaning]
-[water splashing]

10:06.273 --> 10:07.606
-No!
<i> -What?</i>

10:07.608 --> 10:10.809
Nothing. Fuck.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.010
I gotta go.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.745
I just thought of something.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.747
Let's just talk
about this later.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.016
Hey, Amber...

10:18.018 --> 10:21.319
everything's gonna be all right.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.232
[man] That wasn't
the worst part, though.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.236
It wasn't even the fact
that I got arrested

10:38.238 --> 10:41.940
for possession of crack
and heroin.

10:41.941 --> 10:45.643
The worst part wasn't even
that the judge gave me
two to three years.

10:45.646 --> 10:49.681
The worst part was that when
I crashed through the table,

10:49.683 --> 10:52.050
I killed my neighbor's dog.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.386
I guess they'd been
sleeping underneath there.

10:54.388 --> 10:58.990
It's one of those little
furry terrier types.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.128
Hell...

11:04.297 --> 11:08.066
I feel bad because it was
the only dog she had, right?

11:08.068 --> 11:10.201
You know, she loved that thing.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.938
It hadn't done anything
to anybody, you know?

11:13.940 --> 11:16.207
Just goes to show you that

11:16.209 --> 11:18.443
it's usually
the most innocent ones

11:18.445 --> 11:21.413
that hurt the worst, right?

11:21.415 --> 11:25.684
Well, that was 321 days ago.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.853
I was sober for 320 days.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.855
[man] Yeah.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.091
[applause]

11:41.234 --> 11:43.301
[man moaning, panting]

11:51.411 --> 11:52.744
[zipper zips]

11:52.746 --> 11:54.846
[car approaches]

11:54.848 --> 11:57.248
[driver] Jessica, right?

12:08.328 --> 12:11.129
[liquid spurting]

12:20.874 --> 12:22.407
Ta-da!

12:24.111 --> 12:26.010
[chuckles]

12:30.917 --> 12:33.151
[woman] Mm.

12:35.889 --> 12:39.157
[Amber] How's your shoulder
been?

12:39.159 --> 12:42.293
Been worse this week.
They put me in stocking.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.529
You know how heavy
those boxes are?

12:44.531 --> 12:46.965
But, you know,
everything's a give and take.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.968
-You still upset about the car?
-Nah, I'm good.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.170
I mean, Will's
helping me out, so...

12:52.172 --> 12:57.275
That Will is a great boy.
You need more friends like him.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.446
Um, by the way,
I forgot to tell you,

13:01.448 --> 13:06.251
I got some really great leads
this week, so this is for you.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.487
No, honey.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.990
We'll be OK.

13:13.193 --> 13:14.492
We'll be OK.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.061
I promise.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.135
[cell phone buzzing]

13:26.339 --> 13:30.175
-Hey.
-[Will] <i> Hey. So I was thinking</i>
<i> about the plan,</i>

13:30.176 --> 13:34.012
<i> and it's a cool idea,</i>
<i> but it's probably an A1,</i>
<i> probably A2 felony.</i>

13:34.014 --> 13:35.847
<i>Are you sure we should do this?</i>

13:35.849 --> 13:37.315
Yeah, let's do it.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.193
[Will] It's best if we wait
till lunch.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.996
Nine times out of ten,
Daniels orders from the deli

14:24.998 --> 14:26.564
across the street;
usually preorders it

14:26.566 --> 14:29.133
so it won't take him long
to leave and come back.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.352
That's when I'll do it.

14:31.353 --> 14:33.570
All I need you to do
is wait for my cue.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.875
-[Amber] Right.
-From there, just let me know

14:36.877 --> 14:39.010
if you see Daniels coming.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.144
-[Amber] OK.
-Let's get this money.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.088
A footlong.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.291
Extra cheese, no avocado,
no onions.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.027
Yes, ma'am, we do renovations...

14:56.029 --> 14:57.629
Oh, it's not for you
at this time?

14:57.631 --> 15:00.665
Well, thank you so much
for being nice to me.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.367
Goodbye.

15:05.438 --> 15:09.574
"Let's burn
this mother fucker down."

15:11.044 --> 15:14.579
No avocado, no onions.
I hate onion.

15:14.581 --> 15:18.082
I'm a nice guy; you wouldn't
like me when I'm angry.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.568
[laughs] Thanks, baby.

15:20.569 --> 15:23.053
Little lunch or something?
Little sliced turkey and Swiss?

15:23.056 --> 15:24.455
Little Subweezy?

15:24.457 --> 15:26.424
Maybe some human flesh,
some virgins?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.993
[Will chuckles]
No, I'm good, man.

15:28.995 --> 15:31.362
I brought my own lunch today,
but thanks, Martin.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.332
All right, man, good for you.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.060
[Daniels] I'm gonna pick up
my lunch.

15:45.061 --> 15:47.078
Why don't you call payroll
before three o'clock?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.513
Got it.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.173
What?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.410
Come on!

16:23.183 --> 16:25.383
What the...

16:28.521 --> 16:30.288
What are you doing?

16:31.524 --> 16:36.627
Uh... Mr. Daniels asked me
to do a system restore.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.663
He was having problems
with his email.

16:38.665 --> 16:43.201
I took an IT course,
so I'm qualified for this.

16:43.203 --> 16:45.436
Will, are you lying?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.743
I'm kidding. [laughs]

16:51.745 --> 16:53.277
God. [laughs]

16:53.279 --> 16:55.413
[Will chuckles]

16:55.414 --> 16:57.548
He needs to figure
shit out for himself.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.619
Thanks, Marion.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.226
What are you doing?

17:08.228 --> 17:11.095
[whispering] The password
isn't working.

17:11.097 --> 17:14.499
I know, I'm sorry,
I forgot the numerical.
It's "DirtyDaniels69."

17:14.501 --> 17:16.300
Yeah, he's
a dirty little fucker.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.603
Make sure to swallow that
when you're finished.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.348
All right, now try to print it.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.154
Oh, come on!

17:36.156 --> 17:37.822
[mouthing words]

17:37.824 --> 17:40.324
[whispering] It's not printing!

17:48.835 --> 17:51.803
[mouthing words]

18:02.449 --> 18:04.582
-Hey, boss.
-Not now, Jason.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.551
I was just wondering if our
checks are gonna be mailed--

18:06.553 --> 18:08.553
Talk to Marion, she handles
the payroll, OK?

18:08.555 --> 18:11.122
[Jason] Yeah, I was just
wondering, are we gonna
get our checks--

18:11.124 --> 18:12.190
Jason, just talk to Marion.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.492
[Amber] Oh, my God!

18:14.494 --> 18:18.629
-[Daniels] God damnit!
-[Amber] I'm so sorry!

18:18.631 --> 18:20.498
Damn it!

18:26.639 --> 18:31.209
[exhales] It's OK.
Uh, just clean up the mess.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.412
Oh, uh, if you'd get me
another sandwich,

18:34.414 --> 18:36.114
but no onion, OK?

18:36.116 --> 18:37.882
Mm-hmm.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.624
Fuck you, Daniels,
fuck you, JT Renovations!

18:46.626 --> 18:49.393
-Let's go out.
-You know I don't
really drink like that.

18:49.395 --> 18:52.830
-Just one, just one.
-One means three, Amber.

18:52.831 --> 18:56.266
Oh, my God, you know what,
I'm gonna text Jason
and he'll meet us there. Oooh!

18:56.269 --> 18:58.402
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo...

18:58.404 --> 19:01.772
OK! OK, I'm gonna
drink tonight!

19:01.774 --> 19:05.643
[Kaleigh Baker playing
"Travel'n On"]

19:07.714 --> 19:09.547
[man] There you go.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.632
[Jason] All right...

19:27.634 --> 19:30.301
So...

19:30.303 --> 19:32.270
Run it by me again.

19:32.272 --> 19:35.806
OK, so we print
a hard copy of the list,

19:35.808 --> 19:38.576
then we start making calls,
setting ourselves up

19:38.578 --> 19:40.811
as independent contractors,
offer rates that

19:40.813 --> 19:43.648
none of the other
local renovating firms can.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.617
We just need a place
to operate out of.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.953
My brother has a house
up in North Hills.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.856
He's always traveling for work,
there's never anyone there.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.193
[Will] There's just under
3,000 potential clients

19:55.195 --> 19:57.078
on this list.

19:57.079 --> 19:58.962
If we're able to snag
even half of them,

19:58.965 --> 20:01.299
we'll be able to generate--

20:01.300 --> 20:03.634
-A shitload of money.
-In layman's terms,

20:03.635 --> 20:05.969
we just have to convince each
potential client to buy from us.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.505
And that's where I come in.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.373
Wait, wait, I can convince.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.609
Will, you are way too nice.

20:11.611 --> 20:15.446
Jason. Jason, tell her
I can convince.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.682
-Jason?
-We're going to have to
talk about this,

20:17.684 --> 20:22.486
but in the meantime,
let's toast to a...

20:22.488 --> 20:24.889
no-boss future...

20:24.891 --> 20:26.357
No bosses!

20:26.358 --> 20:27.824
-No bosses!
-Fuck Daniels.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.927
Mr. Daniels.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.938
Ooh, yeah.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.824
All right.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.709
Wait, wait, where are you going?
You leaving already?

20:44.711 --> 20:47.011
Yeah, I'm meeting
this girl I met online.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.880
Well, I hope she's a girl,
but, uh, she, uh...

20:49.882 --> 20:51.816
wants to have sex with me.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.252
[billiard balls collide]

20:54.254 --> 20:56.020
That's not funny.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.787
Anyway, she only fucks
guys in their 20s.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.757

you don't like blond guys?

-Just put your arm around me,
it's just for social media.

[driver] Sounds like, um,
a rough day, huh?

28:33.946 --> 28:35.979
Well, my buddy here
lost his phone last night,

28:35.981 --> 28:39.149
so we are tracking it there.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.485
[Will] Tell everybody.
Scream it out the window.

28:41.487 --> 28:42.953
[Amber] Well, he asked.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.288
[phone chimes]

28:44.290 --> 28:45.789
Oh, shit.

28:45.791 --> 28:48.108
[Will] What's wrong?

28:48.109 --> 28:50.426
-Jason just texted.
-Should we tell him?

28:50.429 --> 28:52.863
I don't want him to freak out.

28:52.864 --> 28:55.298
Let's just wait and see
what happens, OK?

28:55.301 --> 28:57.000
[Will] OK.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.386
[Amber] Come on,
stop overthinking it.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.155
Get out of the car.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.291
Thanks for the ride.

29:24.396 --> 29:27.030
You know, for the record,
I am not overthinking.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.967
Can you just give me
a minute, please?

29:29.969 --> 29:32.035
You've had all day.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.439
[knocking on door]

30:09.441 --> 30:11.208
[Will] No one.

30:17.950 --> 30:21.285
[doorbell rings]

30:34.934 --> 30:36.600
I don't think anyone's home.

30:36.601 --> 30:38.267
Are you sure we're in
the right place?

30:38.270 --> 30:40.037
Yeah, I mean,
that's what my phone said.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.572
Let me look.

30:43.242 --> 30:46.109
-My phone's dead.
-Oh, shit.

30:46.111 --> 30:48.095
Do you know what, Amber,

30:48.096 --> 30:50.080
I think we should just
call the cops.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.481
[Amber] The cops? What?

30:51.483 --> 30:54.284
-I would--
-I'll go check around back, OK?

30:54.285 --> 30:57.086
Amber, I don't think that's
a good idea; Amber, I don't
think that's...

30:57.089 --> 30:59.857
-Amber!
-We need this phone.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.593
-Amber--
-Just chill right here.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.864
OK, you're doing it.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.313
Oh, this is a bad idea.

31:23.315 --> 31:27.017
[Amber, deep voice] What you
doin' outside my house, boy?

31:27.019 --> 31:28.418
-Oh, my gosh.
-[chuckles]

31:28.420 --> 31:30.220
Oh, you're eating
their food now?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.990
-You want some?
-No.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.491
Come on!

32:09.261 --> 32:11.194
Uggh.

32:11.196 --> 32:14.064
[Amber] Hello?
Anybody home?

32:14.066 --> 32:15.399
Anybody?

32:15.401 --> 32:18.602
Smells like old person's
breath in here.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.938
God, it does.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.073
I'm gonna go this way.

32:23.075 --> 32:24.574
I'm gonna go
this way.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.352
[Amber] Hello?
Anybody home?

32:52.237 --> 32:54.604
[TV playing softly]

33:37.016 --> 33:38.382
[Will] Jeez!

33:38.384 --> 33:39.783
Got ya.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.735
[Will] Don't do that.

33:41.736 --> 33:43.686
-Did you find it?
-No, nothing.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.288
Do you think anybody's here?

33:45.290 --> 33:48.091
No. TV was on.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.526
How about I go look upstairs?

33:49.528 --> 33:52.462
OK. I'll keep looking around.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.618
Hello?

34:14.620 --> 34:16.786
Anybody home?

35:17.182 --> 35:19.349
Amber!

35:23.789 --> 35:25.755
Amber!

35:30.129 --> 35:31.161
What?

35:31.163 --> 35:33.463
The fucker sold it.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.884
Wait, no, no, that can't be.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.602
The notification said
that it was here.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.804
Well, maybe he hasn't
shipped it out yet.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.507
Yeah, no, it's gotta be here
somewhere.

35:48.680 --> 35:52.849
Will. I mean, it wasn't anywhere
up here, right?

36:02.561 --> 36:04.394
Whoa.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.830
[Will coughs]

36:06.832 --> 36:09.733
[Amber coughs]

36:09.735 --> 36:11.501
[Will] Filthy.

36:22.848 --> 36:24.848
Look, come here.

36:27.719 --> 36:28.919
Isn't that...

36:28.921 --> 36:31.288
[Will] What the fuck?

36:31.290 --> 36:33.741
[footsteps]

36:33.742 --> 36:36.193
[Will] Hey! Hey, hey,
someone's here!

36:36.195 --> 36:37.727
Hey!

36:38.931 --> 36:40.630
-Hey, hey!
-[Amber] Hey!

36:40.632 --> 36:42.632
-[Amber] Open up!
-[Will] Hey!

36:42.634 --> 36:46.870
[Amber] No, let us out! No!

36:46.872 --> 36:48.538
[banging on door]

36:48.540 --> 36:51.208
-[Will] Open up!
-[Amber] No!

36:51.210 --> 36:53.677
[door rattling]

37:01.820 --> 37:04.754
Got so close, he probably...
Oh, my God!

37:04.756 --> 37:06.990
Please!

37:06.992 --> 37:10.227
[Will] Hey!

37:51.970 --> 37:54.804
H-Hello?

37:55.707 --> 37:58.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, listen, please!

37:58.944 --> 38:00.610
Open the door!

38:00.612 --> 38:04.080
[Amber] Please, just give us
the phone and we'll leave!

38:04.081 --> 38:07.549
-Yeah.
-[man] No. How do I know
you won't call the cops?

38:07.552 --> 38:10.320
-We won't call the cops!
-No, please, just let us out!

38:10.322 --> 38:12.055
You can trust us, please!

38:12.057 --> 38:14.691
Open the door!

Hello? Hello!

38:19.498 --> 38:23.433
-[hard rock music playing]
-Hello!

-[Will groaning]
-[metal clanging]

38:37.015 --> 38:39.232
[Amber pounding on door]

38:39.233 --> 38:41.450
Amber! You've been hitting
that door for over an hour.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.653
He's not gonna open it.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.855
Did you get a window
open at least?

38:45.857 --> 38:46.956
[sighs]

38:46.958 --> 38:48.992
Of course.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.727
Ow!

38:52.864 --> 38:55.365
[Will] Great, we're dealing
with a junkie.

38:55.367 --> 38:56.800
[Amber] Ohh!

38:58.737 --> 39:02.339
Did you notice that
that was the guy that...

39:02.341 --> 39:05.008
Driver? Yeah, I know.

39:06.445 --> 39:08.662
[coughs]

39:08.663 --> 39:10.880
-I need some water.
-Oh, shit, are you OK?

39:10.882 --> 39:13.750
Is it like your...
your hypo-- the hyp--

39:13.752 --> 39:16.453
Hyperglycemia.
I'll be all right.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.588
I just wish I had
my weed on me.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.523
Does that really work?
You know, like the weed.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.126
Does that actually help
your condition?

39:25.130 --> 39:26.496
[sighs]

39:26.498 --> 39:28.598
Well, put it this way.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.468
I went from having
three seizures a day

39:31.470 --> 39:34.037
to three seizures a year.

39:37.642 --> 39:40.009
Gonna try to open
this freezer again.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.480
I don't know what he...

39:43.482 --> 39:45.782
Come on, you...
[straining]

39:46.485 --> 39:48.017
[straining]

39:48.019 --> 39:50.620
Come on, you...

39:50.622 --> 39:53.623
[straining] Come on!

39:53.625 --> 39:55.091
Son of...

39:55.093 --> 39:56.726
God damn it!

39:57.863 --> 40:01.498
I always get put
in these situations.

40:01.500 --> 40:05.034
Wait, you're saying this isn't
the first time you've been held
captive in a basement?

40:05.036 --> 40:10.440
I mean the phone, Amanda,
JT Renovations, my disability.

40:10.442 --> 40:13.543
It's like... fuck my phone,
I don't give a shit
about anything.

40:13.545 --> 40:16.413
Don't say that.
I mean...

40:16.415 --> 40:18.882
Don't you know how important
this is to all of us?

40:18.884 --> 40:21.084
-Even with Amanda...
-Ah, the girl from the bar.

40:21.086 --> 40:22.952
Yeah, the girl from the bar,
it looks like

40:22.954 --> 40:25.088
she used me as a decoy
or something.

40:25.090 --> 40:28.024
Like she noticed I was
this nice guy

40:28.026 --> 40:32.962
who was a fucking pushover,
and so she used me.

40:32.964 --> 40:36.699
I think you are probably
the only man ever

40:36.701 --> 40:39.702
to complain about being
used for sex, but...

40:39.704 --> 40:41.638
just sayin'.

40:45.544 --> 40:46.943
Come...

40:46.945 --> 40:52.115
What if... How do you know
that that girl didn't
actually like you?

40:52.117 --> 40:55.618
I mean, come on,
you are like the nicest...

40:55.620 --> 40:58.188
most charming guy
I've ever met.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.027
You know what I think?

41:04.029 --> 41:07.997
I think you just need
a little more willpower.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.135
That's cute, Amber, very cute.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.837
Thank you.

41:17.075 --> 41:19.075
Gonna try this again.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.083
Aaah!

-Yes!
-Hah! Look!

41:30.922 --> 41:32.889
-Ice!
-Frozen water.

41:40.899 --> 41:44.033
There's pizza, vegetables...

41:47.906 --> 41:49.172

42:56.007 --> 42:58.041
I know your mother's
been under the weather

42:58.043 --> 43:00.143
and we bought her
some get-well presents.

43:00.145 --> 43:01.811
Can we just pop in
for a second?

43:01.813 --> 43:03.747
I haven't seen her
in at least a month.

43:03.748 --> 43:05.682
[man] She's been under
the weather the last few days,

43:05.684 --> 43:07.850
so she's kind of sleeping.

43:07.852 --> 43:10.853
I understand.
Well, tell her that we came by

43:10.855 --> 43:14.057
and that we hope she gets
better in time for mah jongg,
this Thursday.

43:14.059 --> 43:16.593
Oh, absolutely.
Thank you so much.

One more thing.
I was hoping--

43:23.902 --> 43:26.169
Let us out, you fuck!

That's your name?

43:32.110 --> 43:34.611
Eh... Jacob.

43:34.613 --> 43:37.046
If you just give us the phone,

43:37.048 --> 43:39.616
I swear to you
we won't call the cops.

43:39.618 --> 43:42.785
We'll just go on our merry way,
we'll just go home.

43:42.787 --> 43:45.822
It's not here! I...

43:47.125 --> 43:48.891
I gotta go get it.

43:55.900 --> 43:59.168
I'm sorry.
I'm not a bad person, I--

No, no, no, we get it, yeah.
You're not a bad person.

44:02.774 --> 44:04.307
You're not a bad person at all.

46:47.338 --> 46:49.071
[Jacob] Come on.

46:54.045 --> 46:55.578
What's wrong?

46:59.083 --> 47:01.317
All right, just piss.

47:04.222 --> 47:05.922
You could close the door.

47:05.924 --> 47:07.824
No, no, I can't.
I don't trust you, just...

47:07.826 --> 47:08.958
[Amber] Oh, my God.

47:08.960 --> 47:10.459
I won't look.

47:10.461 --> 47:12.295
Thank you.

47:28.913 --> 47:30.146
Keep going.

47:30.148 --> 47:31.614
Wh-What are you doing?

47:31.616 --> 47:33.616
Just-- Just give me one.

47:33.618 --> 47:35.868
What?

47:35.869 --> 47:38.119
Come on, look, if you're
gonna fucking lock me
in that basement,

47:38.122 --> 47:40.590
the least you can do is just
give me a hit, man.

47:40.592 --> 47:43.109
What are you talking about?

47:43.110 --> 47:45.627
I smelled it the minute that
I walked in the living room.

47:46.931 --> 47:49.131
Just, please...

47:50.602 --> 47:52.568
Just sit down.

48:06.918 --> 48:08.985
No, you can't hold it so close.

Listen, I know what I'm doing.

[coughs]

48:37.582 --> 48:40.616
[Jacob] Does the guy
downstairs do this shit?

48:40.618 --> 48:43.219
He doesn't know shit.

48:43.221 --> 48:46.689
He thinks I got arrested
for weed.

48:46.691 --> 48:49.659
Wait... you got arrested?

48:49.661 --> 48:52.194
And they took my car.

48:52.196 --> 48:54.463
It's very expensive.

48:54.465 --> 48:57.166
You know, but I'm dealing
with it, I am.

48:57.168 --> 48:59.502
What were the charges?

49:11.449 --> 49:15.518
Damn.
That's some serious shit.

49:24.629 --> 49:27.596
All right, now, come on.

49:29.033 --> 49:30.850
-Come on.
-No, no, no, no no.

49:30.851 --> 49:32.668
I just wanna lay here,
just for like...

49:32.670 --> 49:34.337
just a little bit longer.

49:34.339 --> 49:36.305
Do you wanna lay with me?

49:36.307 --> 49:39.008
-Come on.
-No, no, you can't, come on.

49:39.010 --> 49:41.010

-We gotta go, let's go.

49:41.012 --> 49:43.379

-Shh! It's OK.

49:45.383 --> 49:46.649

-Come on!

Don't make any noise, all right?

49:58.262 --> 50:01.497
If you do, I'll have
to shoot you, just go!

50:03.267 --> 50:07.670
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
What happened?

50:09.707 --> 50:13.542
[doorbell ringing]

50:16.514 --> 50:20.049
[Jacob] I'm not a fucking
candy man, read the sign.

50:20.051 --> 50:22.151
[man] Trick or treat, bitch!

50:22.153 --> 50:24.453
-Yeah.
-Yo, Damian.

50:24.455 --> 50:28.040
I thought I'd stop by,
heard you got some candy, kid.

50:28.041 --> 50:31.626
-Get in here, man.
-Took your sweet ass time
answering the door, homey.

50:31.629 --> 50:33.429
What the fuck's up
with your phone, dude?

50:33.431 --> 50:35.698
I tried calling you like
three times on the way here.

50:35.700 --> 50:39.101
[TV playing softly]

50:39.103 --> 50:40.770
Fuck.

50:40.771 --> 50:42.438
What the fuck got you acting
like a scared little girl?

50:42.440 --> 50:46.042
Yo, man, I need your help.

50:46.044 --> 50:48.644
-No.
-What do you mean no?

50:48.646 --> 50:50.413
You said if I ever needed
your help

50:50.415 --> 50:52.615
with something I couldn't
handle, you'd help me.

50:52.617 --> 50:54.583
[Damian] I'm gonna need
a little taste of something...

50:54.585 --> 50:57.353
-Just fucking listen, Damian.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

50:57.355 --> 50:59.722
I said already,
just put her in the freezer.

50:59.724 --> 51:01.724
No, dude, that's not what
I'm fucking talking about.

51:01.726 --> 51:04.427
-I already fucking did that.
-Then what?

51:04.429 --> 51:07.163
I needed some extra cash
the other night, right?

51:07.165 --> 51:09.732
Aren't you still getting your
mom's social security checks?

51:09.734 --> 51:12.301
-Yeah, I'm fucking
getting those, but--
-You've been getting greedy.

51:12.303 --> 51:14.437
No, it's not fucking
greed, Damian.

51:14.438 --> 51:16.572
-You're getting greedy.
-Shut up, it's not
greed, Damian.

51:16.574 --> 51:19.608
The mortgage, the taxes,
car insurance.

51:19.610 --> 51:21.844
Not to mention
those fucking pills.

51:21.846 --> 51:25.314
I'm sick and tired of dressing
up as a fucking woman.

51:25.316 --> 51:27.383
[Damian] You're not playing.

51:27.385 --> 51:31.353
All right.
So, what the hell happened?

51:33.624 --> 51:36.492
I was at the bar
the other night, man.

51:36.494 --> 51:38.761
I took some dude's phone.

51:38.763 --> 51:42.364
Next thing I know, he's doing
that thing that finds it--

51:42.366 --> 51:45.201
-Fucking tracker.
-Yeah, and get this.

51:45.203 --> 51:47.436
I fucking drove them.

51:47.438 --> 51:50.773
Hold up, hold up, let me
make sure I'm getting this.

51:50.775 --> 51:55.277
You stole this dude's phone,
and it just so happened

51:55.279 --> 51:57.847
that he was the guy
you were picking up?

51:57.849 --> 52:02.118
-Yeah.
-And then you bring him
back here...

52:02.120 --> 52:05.721
to help him find his
stolen phone that you took?

52:08.726 --> 52:10.860
[laughs]

52:10.862 --> 52:14.797
Holy shit!
You can't make
that shit up, man.

52:14.799 --> 52:17.566
It's not fucking funny.
I don't know what to fuckin' do.

52:17.568 --> 52:21.570
-Tell them to fuck off.
-Yeah, it's a little more
fucking complicated than that.

52:21.572 --> 52:24.206
No, it's not, I do it
all the time: fuck off!

52:24.208 --> 52:27.143
No, dude, they're
in my basement!

52:27.145 --> 52:29.578
You're not playing with me.

52:29.580 --> 52:31.280
I'm fucked.

52:31.282 --> 52:33.382
I'm gonna need a drink.

52:33.384 --> 52:36.218
The guy, how much he weigh?

52:36.220 --> 52:40.189
150. Maybe like 160.

52:40.191 --> 52:41.524
And the girl?

52:41.526 --> 52:42.858
I don't know, she's tight.

52:42.860 --> 52:44.560
Tight?

52:44.562 --> 52:46.729
Yeah, like petite-ish.

52:46.731 --> 52:49.449
She cute?

52:49.450 --> 52:52.168
Yeah, I guess, but that's
not the point, Damian.

52:52.170 --> 52:55.171
All right, we're gonna need
some lime and a shovel.

52:55.173 --> 52:57.940
Why do you need a lime?

52:57.941 --> 53:00.708
Lime. Not limes, lime.
Like quicklime, it's a thing.

53:00.711 --> 53:02.845
Joe Pesci uses it
in <i> Goodfellas.</i>

53:02.847 --> 53:05.231
Gonna help dissolve the body.

53:05.232 --> 53:07.616
Take them out to the desert,
like Palm Springs or something?

53:07.618 --> 53:09.919
I don't know,
maybe that's too far.

53:09.921 --> 53:11.787
I can't fucking do that, Damian.

53:11.789 --> 53:13.856
[Damian] Well, then, I guess
I can't help you.

53:13.858 --> 53:16.375
No, no, stop, I'm listening.

53:16.376 --> 53:18.893
I mean, they saw
the body, right?
And if they saw the body,

53:18.896 --> 53:22.765
then that means
they're gonna tell the police
and then we can't get our fix.

53:24.602 --> 53:26.869
Before you do anything,
you still owe me.

53:28.873 --> 53:31.190
The hundo.

53:31.191 --> 53:33.508
I don't forget shit, kid,
I'm a fuckin' encyclopedia.

53:33.511 --> 53:36.545
Hey, can I get one
of your mom's oxy's?

53:36.547 --> 53:38.347

some weird shit, kid.

you liked my Halloween mask.

been holding out on me.

Yo, Damian.
I do have another oxy.

55:13.377 --> 55:15.678
I'll just split it.

killed him with bleach?

55:55.820 --> 55:59.855

You killed Damian.

Well, that was meant
for you, actually.

When you're a little kid,

you think
you're gonna live forever.
