01:25.040 --> 01:29.680
- Ice cream for the grownups!
- No, it's for us!

01:29.840 --> 01:34.520
Then I need a big hug.
Come here, you!

01:34.680 --> 01:37.040
Oh, you're just the best!

01:41.560 --> 01:46.800
Hey!
Say goodbye to your aunt and uncle.

01:46.960 --> 01:49.520
- No ice cream! Come on.
- We want ice cream!

01:49.680 --> 01:53.000
See you, my darling.

01:53.160 --> 01:56.040
See you soon, okay?
Bye.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.560
Did you eat a lot of sugar?

02:15.120 --> 02:17.840
I don't know how you do it.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.600
I'm just helping his little body
release some tension.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.960
It must be so great
to be able to do that.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.240
You must be a wonderful mum.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.640
Don't you have any children yet?

02:44.640 --> 02:47.200
Honey, it's time!

03:02.280 --> 03:04.920
Malte, I'm ready.

03:09.560 --> 03:13.720
That baby is going to have
the hottest mum ever!

03:15.520 --> 03:19.520
Oh, honey...
Rose petals. How pretty!

03:19.680 --> 03:23.040
- Are they real?
- Yes.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.160
Wait, honey...
I just want to move my leg over here.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.440
Yes... That's it.

03:47.320 --> 03:53.240
No, wait. Don't forget the angle.
We need to adjust by 45 degrees.

03:55.280 --> 03:57.320
There... Whoops!

03:57.480 --> 04:01.840
That's it. Yes.
Okay, honey. Let's make that baby.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.880
Yes!

04:06.840 --> 04:16.680
MAYBE BABY

04:16.839 --> 04:20.160
Let's move those up there...

04:24.200 --> 04:27.360
- It's that one over there.
- Yes.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.160
- Well, I bought wheat.
- I told you to get whole grain...

04:32.320 --> 04:34.680
Hello.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.760
- Hello.
- Welcome.

04:41.320 --> 04:46.280
The last stragglers have arrived.
My name is ThorbjÃ¸rn SÃ¸rensen.

04:46.440 --> 04:52.760
I'm the head doctor here at the
TopsÃ¸e & Dichmann Fertility Clinic.

04:54.280 --> 04:58.560
I'll spend an hour explaining
the process you'll be going through.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.440
- Please ask questions afterwards.
- I've a question.

05:02.600 --> 05:08.840
Do you use follitropin alpha
or follitropin beta hormone?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.560
Let's start at the beginning
so everyone can keep up.

05:12.720 --> 05:16.320
- Yes, of course.
- Yes...?

05:16.480 --> 05:20.720
Are there any statistics
on how often your attempts fail?

05:20.880 --> 05:24.960
No, but we have the highest
success rate in the country.

05:25.120 --> 05:30.040
Is there anything you can do
if you'd rather have a boy?

05:31.120 --> 05:35.440
No.
Some people find that idea unethical.

05:35.600 --> 05:41.800
Hi, I'm Liv. Can you replace the
hormones with something more natural?

05:41.960 --> 05:47.160
Natural? You realise this is called
"artificial insemination," right?

05:47.320 --> 05:50.960
- That was rather good, eh?
- Shouldn't we just adopt?

05:51.120 --> 05:55.320
- We should have our own.
- Why don't we move on?

05:55.480 --> 05:57.000
I refer you to Appendix 8...

05:57.160 --> 06:00.280
<i>The initial treatment
integrates easily into your lives</i>

06:00.440 --> 06:04.520
<i>but you have to take the hormones
at exact times.</i>

06:04.680 --> 06:09.200
...as per section 36, clause 2.
Can we take a short break?

06:09.360 --> 06:11.360
Thank you.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.200
<i>You can inject the needle
into your belly yourself.</i>

06:19.360 --> 06:23.120
<i>Don't worry.
It's completely painless.</i>

06:23.280 --> 06:25.240
Ow!

06:25.400 --> 06:27.440
Ow!

06:27.600 --> 06:29.560
Love you.

06:31.280 --> 06:35.800
<i>Most of you won't notice
any changes from the hormones.</i>

06:45.880 --> 06:48.800
<i>Egg retrieval can be a bit painful.</i>

06:48.960 --> 06:54.240
<i>So it's a good idea to bring
your partner along for support.</i>

06:55.680 --> 07:00.080
<i>The embryo transfer is a quick
and mostly pain-free procedure.</i>

07:00.960 --> 07:03.600
Ow, ow, ow...!

07:07.960 --> 07:13.040
<i>Then all you have to do is wait,
while science does the work for you.</i>

07:17.480 --> 07:20.520
<i>We use a very efficient
treatment method</i>

07:20.680 --> 07:25.880
<i>so most of you
will soon see positive results.</i>

07:47.120 --> 07:50.600
<i>For those of you who aren't so lucky</i>

07:50.760 --> 07:53.080
<i>just get back on the horse!</i>

08:11.360 --> 08:16.320
Honey? I think it wants you to do it.

08:17.440 --> 08:21.280
We have to be there
in 20 minutes, all right?

08:24.000 --> 08:29.160
It's more romantic
when we do it together, right?

08:30.560 --> 08:32.120
Okay.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.760
Okay, honey!

08:51.280 --> 08:53.000
SOLVING INVOLUNTARY CHILDLESSNESS

08:55.320 --> 09:00.280
- Hello.
- Hello. We brought one of these.

09:00.440 --> 09:06.120
- All right. Please have a seat.
- Take care of it!

09:06.280 --> 09:09.640
- Hello.
- Hello.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.160
- Peppermint cracker?
- No, thank you.

09:17.320 --> 09:20.880
- They're great when you're bloated.
- I'm not.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.240
- Would you like a cracker?
- Yes. Thank you.

09:25.400 --> 09:28.880
- Are they home-made?
- Yes.

09:29.040 --> 09:33.680
I'm sorry, Malte.
There wasn't quite enough.

09:35.040 --> 09:40.800
- But there was plenty.
- It's not always about the quantity.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.280
All yours.

10:16.960 --> 10:20.280
- Liv? Can you come in here?
- Sure.

10:20.440 --> 10:24.840
No, you have to do it alone to keep
the penis free of saliva and bacteria.

10:25.000 --> 10:30.560
- It can contaminate the sperm sample.
- Okay. We don't want that.

10:36.680 --> 10:42.080
How perverted of you to help out
without checking the consequences.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.200
- There must be a manual.
- It didn't mention that.

10:45.360 --> 10:49.200
Well, you've probably
messed this one up too, then.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.000
That's too high!

10:52.160 --> 10:55.400
- Not so high!
- Good Lord...

10:57.120 --> 11:01.320
- Hey, darling.
- Auntie gets to practice a bit.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.960
No, no... Be careful!

11:05.920 --> 11:08.000
That looks too dangerous.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.320
If your body isn't suited for pregnancy
then focus on your job.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.920
You're successful in that area.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.440
For me?

11:24.160 --> 11:28.480
Oh, did you hear...
Cousin Karen is pregnant again.

11:28.640 --> 11:34.240
They didn't want any more, but that's
what happens when you're not careful.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.000
That's nice for them.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.560
Just relax, honey.
Think positive thoughts.

11:41.720 --> 11:46.640
- The egg has divided. That's good.
- Yes, but where are they?

11:46.800 --> 11:52.200
I'm sorry for the delay.
May I have your identification number?

11:52.360 --> 11:56.240
- Yes, it's 120680...
- I need them now! Oops.

11:56.400 --> 12:01.840
- I thought you were done.
- I'll be there in a second.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.680
- Could you...?
- Yeah, I'll just close it.

12:14.840 --> 12:18.760
- The cake is in the oven.
- Are we done already?

12:18.920 --> 12:25.400
Yes, we finished without you.
I'm almost like a stepdad!

12:25.560 --> 12:28.880
Come on. Please, come on!

12:52.920 --> 12:56.400
Malte? I'm pregnant.

12:56.560 --> 13:00.640
- What? You're sure?
- Yes.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.280
- I'm pregnant!
- Yes!

13:05.440 --> 13:09.480
- You have to... One second.
- What is it?

13:09.640 --> 13:12.680
Yes! All right!

13:17.840 --> 13:21.320
I got it on a dumpster-dive last week.
It's okay, right?

13:21.480 --> 13:25.200
- Sure, one glass is okay.
- Here you go.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.960
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

13:32.840 --> 13:35.440
I guess not.
I need to show you this.

13:37.640 --> 13:43.720
This app scans our faces,
and then it makes our baby.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.560
Oh...!

13:48.320 --> 13:53.160
Oh, it's so cute.
So cute!

13:53.320 --> 13:56.960
It looks just like you.
It has your eyebrows and nose.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.880
Yes...

14:06.160 --> 14:09.600
- We have a winner.
- Yes! I told you.

14:09.760 --> 14:14.480
- Eight home tests can't be wrong.
- Well, let's not jinx it.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.440
- Honey, we're pregnant!
- Careful!

14:17.600 --> 14:20.800
Andreas, put me down.
Put me down.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.840
Well.

14:29.320 --> 14:35.040
Excuse us. She's worried it won't last.
We've been unlucky before.

14:35.200 --> 14:40.880
Now you have me to lead the charge.
Keep calm and everything will work out.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.680
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.360
I have a present for you, Mum.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.840
Darling, finally!

14:57.120 --> 14:59.600
I'm so happy.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.040
Have you known long?

15:03.200 --> 15:06.520
No. We wanted to be sure
before we shared the news.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.760
You forget how nervous I've been.

15:08.920 --> 15:13.760
I've been waiting since you were 19.
You're taking Zimmermann's herbal shots?

15:13.920 --> 15:18.000
- No. Where do I buy those?
- "Buy"? If you want something done...

15:18.160 --> 15:21.320
- Are you feeling nauseous?
- Not really...

15:21.480 --> 15:26.720
I felt amazing when I was pregnant.
Beautiful! Not that your dad noticed.

15:26.880 --> 15:31.360
Did I mention Mary-Ann's daughter
made all her baby clothes herself?

15:31.520 --> 15:36.880
Well, no one with any self-respect
would buy that factory-made junk.

15:39.960 --> 15:43.280
- Hey.
- Hello. Hey, Ulla.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.920
- Congratulations, Malte.
- Oh yeah. Thanks.

15:47.080 --> 15:52.080
I'm glad you finally sent
your little soldiers off.

15:52.240 --> 15:57.000
- Take care of our beautiful girl.
- I'm pretty sure it'll be a boy.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.280
Grandmas know these things.

16:05.720 --> 16:10.280
Be sure to keep your strength up.
It's going to be a long day.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.560
HEALTHY BABY FOOD
STRAIGHT TO YOUR DOOR

16:29.360 --> 16:31.560
Just a minute.

16:34.640 --> 16:38.240
- Everything okay?
- Yes. I'm just hungover.

16:38.400 --> 16:42.240
On a Tuesday?
You're a busy bee, eh?

16:43.360 --> 16:47.560
The goal is to get
a 5.5 million euro compensation.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.400
This case is of the utmost importance.
We have to win it.

16:51.560 --> 16:55.280
- We will.
- Yes, of course.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.760
Be prepared for a hard year.

16:57.920 --> 17:02.800
But with Cecilie leading the charge,
we're in safe hands.

17:02.960 --> 17:06.560
Okay? Shall we get started?

17:15.400 --> 17:20.040
- Jan, do you have a minute?
- I have a half.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.400
I just have to tell you that I...
I'm pregnant.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.920
Pregnant?
Aren't you much too old for that?

17:31.080 --> 17:36.080
I mean... I didn't think you were
the maternal type. But congratulations.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.760
Thank you.

17:37.920 --> 17:42.800
I hope you know what you're doing.
Nappies don't mix well with this job.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.720
Andreas is taking half the leave.
I'll be back before you know it.

17:46.880 --> 17:52.040
Okay...
A heads-up would have been nice.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.440
Yes... But this was a whoopsie.

17:55.600 --> 18:00.640
My two youngest were whoopsies, too.
Just stay focused on the case.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.280
Yes. I will.

18:03.440 --> 18:10.280
Excuse me... I'll be focused...
I have to take this.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.560
This is Cecilie.

18:17.240 --> 18:21.480
This will be the herb garden.
Basil and mint.

18:21.640 --> 18:25.280
- Thyme.
- Of course. All the good things.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.760
And set up the spare room

18:27.920 --> 18:32.160
so I can move in and help out
the first couple of months.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.760
Malte and I think it would be better
to expand the living room.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.040
You can be here during the day.

18:39.200 --> 18:44.000
Trust me, you'll be needing help 24/7.
Men are no help at night.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.920
Right.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.960
This is Liv.

18:51.120 --> 18:56.360
- What's this about?
- Let's go in here and close the door.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.640
Please, have a seat.

18:59.800 --> 19:05.200
- This is Mogens. He owns the clinic.
- Is something wrong with the baby?

19:05.360 --> 19:09.400
No, no. Your baby is doing fine.

19:09.560 --> 19:15.520
But there's been an administrative
error. It's never happened before.

19:15.680 --> 19:21.080
Your egg has unfortunately been swapped
with that of another couple.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.200
What?

19:23.360 --> 19:28.600
- Mogens, would you elaborate?
- They've been swapped. The eggs.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.560
How can that happen?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.720
We don't know.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.760
You have to know
how the hell this happened!

19:37.920 --> 19:42.640
It shouldn't have been possible.
We don't really understand.

19:42.800 --> 19:48.480
- But it...
- Easy. There must be an explanation.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.800
Mogens?

19:51.960 --> 19:54.920
They've simply been swapped.

19:55.080 --> 19:58.920
We paid for a private clinic
to make sure we'd be in safe hands.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.680
Yes, the public sector
can be very messy.

20:01.840 --> 20:07.880
But it's my sperm in the egg?
Or is that swapped too?

20:08.040 --> 20:11.920
It's not just the sperm,
it's the whole lot.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.360
But what do we do now?

20:15.520 --> 20:20.400
- We can terminate the pregnancy.
- That's not happening.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.480
Do you realise what we've
been through to get here?

20:24.640 --> 20:30.840
- We'll terminate and try again.
- No. I have a little person in here.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.880
It would be selfish to kill
an innocent being. I can't do it.

20:36.040 --> 20:41.560
You told me I don't have a lot of eggs,
and then you go and mess it up.

20:41.720 --> 20:46.520
Calm down. There's no reason
you can't have a happy ending.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.360
Who has our child, then?

20:50.800 --> 20:55.520
- Honey, mind the baby.
- It's not even my baby!

20:55.680 --> 20:59.760
They've impregnated me
with another couple's baby.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.560
Kim and Helle, you're up.

21:09.800 --> 21:14.480
- I'll press charges.
- Honey, settle down.

21:14.640 --> 21:18.200
Why don't you terminate?

21:18.360 --> 21:19.920
Come on, Dad!

21:20.080 --> 21:25.800
Lars, look at her. She's 42.
If she wants a baby, it has to be now.

21:25.960 --> 21:31.840
- Just swap them once they're born.
- Are we sure that's the right approach?

21:32.000 --> 21:37.600
- Of course. What else can we do?
- I don't know.

21:37.760 --> 21:44.440
What if one day you spot a mini Andreas
who has your eyes and sweet smile?

21:44.600 --> 21:49.160
We don't know their genetics. We've
never had a disability in our family.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.200
- Irene!
- Mental disorders are hereditary.

21:52.360 --> 21:55.320
Yes, what if that baby is super sick?

21:55.480 --> 21:59.120
Or a redhead.
I'm just saying.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.160
Liv, I think it's up here.
It's right up here.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.120
There.

22:18.400 --> 22:23.400
It's huge.
Are you sure it's the right address?

22:23.560 --> 22:26.080
You like that, don't you?

22:26.240 --> 22:29.880
Bloody hell. It's a Model S.
Does it have a sunroof?

22:30.040 --> 22:33.160
Hello. Welcome.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.280
We're glad you could make it.

22:36.440 --> 22:39.880
- Thanks for having us. Hello.
- Hello.

22:40.040 --> 22:45.320
- Hey.
- Oh. Hello.

22:45.480 --> 22:49.800
- What a mess. We're beside ourselves.
- We're still in shock.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.200
We'll figure out a solution.

22:52.360 --> 22:55.240
Bloody hell! It's gigantic!

22:55.400 --> 22:59.440
I can give you a tour?
This is our living room...

22:59.600 --> 23:03.400
- Beautiful wallpaper.
- Thank you. Should I open it?

23:03.560 --> 23:05.440
Please.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.040
- Wow...
- It sends out healing energy.

23:10.200 --> 23:15.680
- I made it myself. It's a bracelet.
- It's very nice.

23:15.840 --> 23:22.520
- I have a gift for you, too.
- Wow. Okay. What's this?

23:22.680 --> 23:27.080
It's a heart rate monitor. Then you
can always keep track of the baby.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.760
That's clever.
I probably won't need it though.

23:30.920 --> 23:35.520
My body is really good at sensing
how the baby is doing. But thanks.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.640
It's good to have, just in case.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.440
Wow. You have more rooms
than you know what to do with.

23:43.600 --> 23:47.320
Yes, there are lots of possibilities.
This will be the nursery.

23:47.480 --> 23:52.320
We're waiting a bit.
Just in case...

23:52.480 --> 23:56.840
You have a lot of books about fertility.
Have you been trying long?

23:57.000 --> 23:59.640
May I offer you a drink?

23:59.800 --> 24:04.000
- I wouldn't mind a beer.
- Do you have kombucha?

24:04.160 --> 24:07.880
- I think we're all out of...
- Yes, I believe so.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.320
Oh, okay. Sparkling water, then?

24:10.480 --> 24:15.040
We drink a lot of that here,
now that we're pregnant.

24:15.200 --> 24:19.520
- I'll go get that.
- I'll help out.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.760
"We" are pregnant?

24:23.800 --> 24:28.480
- So sorry I'm late.
- What are you doing here?

24:28.640 --> 24:33.080
- Isn't the baby-swap meeting today?
- You're not invited.

24:33.240 --> 24:36.800
Oh. But I have really good news.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.480
We've decided to give you a refund

24:40.640 --> 24:44.920
if you agree to keep
this little incident quiet.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.480
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

24:48.640 --> 24:51.920
We've been looking forward
to getting to know you.

24:52.080 --> 24:56.200
- Us, too.
- What do you do for work?

24:56.360 --> 25:00.960
I work as a body SDS therapist
in the Holistic House.

25:01.120 --> 25:05.240
- Body... what?
- Self Development System.

25:05.400 --> 25:11.720
- Malte is an electrician.
- And I work on our own project.

25:11.880 --> 25:17.160
- We've bought a great allotment house.
- It's nice to have a hobby.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.960
It's not just a hobby.
We're having water and heating put in

25:21.120 --> 25:24.200
and then we're moving in
when the baby comes.

25:24.360 --> 25:29.800
- It sounds a bit cold.
- Not at all. What do you do?

25:31.400 --> 25:34.880
Andreas owns a real estate business
and I'm an attorney.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.960
Sounds like you keep busy.
We're saving up

25:38.120 --> 25:41.840
so we can work less
once the baby's here.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.200
On that subject, maybe we should
talk about how to handle the swap?

25:46.280 --> 25:51.960
- Yes, on a practical level.
- Right. But...

25:53.080 --> 25:58.160
Are we sure we even want to swap?

25:58.320 --> 26:01.320
Of course we are.
We've talked about this.

26:01.480 --> 26:04.920
- It's not a matter of course.
- Yes, it is.

26:05.080 --> 26:08.120
But you can't avoid
feeling a connection

26:08.280 --> 26:12.320
when you give life to a baby.
Don't you feel the same way?

26:12.480 --> 26:16.200
It's also about genetics.
Eye colour, smile, personality.

26:16.360 --> 26:20.320
Love isn't just based on genetics.
What about the symbiosis?

26:20.480 --> 26:24.920
I need to stop you right there
and ask for clarification.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.520
- You're saying you don't want to swap?
- No.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.480
Oh, okay. For a minute I thought...

26:31.640 --> 26:34.720
I just don't know yet.

26:38.400 --> 26:44.000
Liv, you can't give this guy away.
Look how cute he'll be.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.680
- Wow...
- Oh.

26:46.840 --> 26:52.600
I just don't think I can know
until I've really felt it in my body.

26:52.760 --> 26:54.960
That's just how I feel.

26:56.880 --> 27:01.320
I refuse to have their hippie baby!
Good grief, it was ugly.

27:01.480 --> 27:04.960
- We're three against one.
- Some genes shouldn't reproduce.

27:05.120 --> 27:09.280
She's probably the type
to not believe in medical science.

27:09.440 --> 27:14.680
- She's a double dipper, honey!
- Double-dipping? Isn't that allowed?

27:14.840 --> 27:20.160
No! It's dangerous when you're
pregnant. It spreads germs!

27:20.320 --> 27:24.040
Honey, I'm sure you and I
can get through this together.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.920
This is an absurd situation!

27:27.080 --> 27:31.440
I think you'll feel much calmer
once you've come to know her.

27:31.600 --> 27:35.800
And you need
to stay friendly with her, okay?

27:37.080 --> 27:41.520
- There, honey. It'll be all right.
- Yeah.

27:41.680 --> 27:46.120
Thank you. There won't be a settlement.
Because I'm not done...

27:56.480 --> 28:00.400
No, I'm still here.
They'll pay the full damages.

28:00.560 --> 28:05.640
- Here are some cigarettes for you.
- Thank you. How kind.

28:05.800 --> 28:09.040
<i>When you're pregnant, your baby
is shaped by what you do.</i>

28:09.200 --> 28:13.200
<i>Everything makes a mark
on your body, mind and soul.</i>

28:13.360 --> 28:16.600
<i>Every tiny imbalance affects the foetus.</i>

28:16.760 --> 28:22.760
- Hey, gorgeous.
<i>- Holistic well-being is crucial.</i>

28:22.920 --> 28:25.280
<i>Learning how to breathe...</i>

28:25.440 --> 28:29.480
Whoa, amazing!
It's not all caffeine-free, is it?

28:29.640 --> 28:33.120
No, I'm not that selfish,
Come here.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.640
Yuck. What did you...?

28:36.800 --> 28:38.760
It's an herbal drink.

28:38.920 --> 28:42.760
My mum says it helps balance the body.
I made some for Cecilie, too.

28:42.920 --> 28:47.520
- You can't force her to drink it.
- I assume she'll do it voluntarily.

28:47.680 --> 28:52.400
She seemed incredibly tense.
It's really not good for her baby.

28:52.560 --> 28:57.120
- Our baby, right?
- What? Yes, sure.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.480
Yes?

29:00.640 --> 29:06.000
Hello, Jan. May I? We've been
approached by a possible client.

29:06.160 --> 29:10.880
A woman undergoing fertility treatment
who had her eggs swapped.

29:11.040 --> 29:14.400
She is now pregnant with another
woman's baby and vice versa.

29:14.560 --> 29:19.920
She wants to know if it's possible
to draw up a form of swapping contract.

29:20.080 --> 29:25.240
That sounds far out. Good thing
you did it the old-fashioned way.

29:25.400 --> 29:29.760
Yeah... It's not my area of expertise,
but as far as I can tell

29:29.920 --> 29:36.120
nothing in the legislation deals
with this exact problem. Right?

29:39.280 --> 29:43.600
- What about Mirabella?
- We're not discussing names.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.480
- Isabella?
- Not yet, honey.

29:46.640 --> 29:51.600
We need to get this contract done
to make sure we get our own child.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.800
Unless she manages
to damage it before then.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.960
She smokes.
She probably drinks, too.

29:58.120 --> 30:03.760
Honey... I think you need to focus
on something very different.

30:05.360 --> 30:07.680
A bit harder there. Higher up.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.080
My thumbs are cramping!

30:10.240 --> 30:13.720
Why don't you try the Body PMS stuff
Liv works with?

30:13.880 --> 30:16.560
No way am I going
to that hocus pocus house.

30:29.880 --> 30:34.640
- Can I help you?
- No, I'm just having a look.

30:42.240 --> 30:46.160
We've really loosened up
some of that pent-up tension.

30:46.320 --> 30:50.400
Drink plenty of water
and take it easy the rest of the day.

30:50.560 --> 30:53.160
I will. It was a pleasure as always.

30:53.320 --> 30:57.040
- See you Monday, Jacob.
- See you.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.920
Cecilie?

31:02.880 --> 31:06.720
- What? Liv?
- What are you doing here?

31:06.880 --> 31:10.680
- So this is Cecilie?
- Hello.

31:10.840 --> 31:14.400
- Hello, little darling.
- This is my mum.

31:14.560 --> 31:20.080
Okay... I was in the neighbourhood
and thought I'd see where you work.

31:20.240 --> 31:23.480
That's so sweet of you.
I really appreciate that.

31:23.640 --> 31:29.240
Oh yes, and if I may...
I have this for you as well.

31:29.400 --> 31:34.080
- Thank you. What is it?
- It's our swapping contract.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.760
Liv isn't even sure
if she wants to swap yet!

31:37.920 --> 31:41.520
Maybe Liv and I
should keep this between ourselves.

31:41.680 --> 31:46.160
But I'm the grandma, and
I've been waiting a long time for this.

31:46.320 --> 31:50.680
- Mum, there's a customer.
- Yes, yes.

31:50.840 --> 31:56.280
It's legally sound. I had it drawn up
for everyone's benefit.

31:56.440 --> 31:59.400
Malte will probably
like the idea as well.

31:59.560 --> 32:06.400
Perhaps, but I can't sign this
until I know it feels right for me.

32:10.200 --> 32:13.920
- When will you know?
- When I know.

32:14.080 --> 32:18.400
When you know.
How about this:

32:19.560 --> 32:24.040
Give it a read. Then we can meet
when we're halfway there.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.720
We'll have a cup of tea.

32:26.880 --> 32:31.680
Then maybe you and your gut
will have reached the right decision.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.800
I have a much better idea.

32:36.840 --> 32:40.400
Ow! Does it have to be so rough?

32:40.560 --> 32:47.360
I'm applying very little pressure,
but your body is on high alert. Breathe.

32:51.400 --> 32:55.800
- That's very ticklish!
- Your body is defending itself.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.680
- What is your body feeling now?
- Pass.

32:59.840 --> 33:04.640
- Should it feel something?
- The body always feels something.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.760
Ow!

33:06.920 --> 33:11.840
I know, I feel it too. What's your
relationship with your mother like?

33:20.800 --> 33:23.000
Tough day?

33:24.760 --> 33:28.440
- A hot dog with chili dressing.
- You got it. 5 euro.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.120
Lovely.

33:31.280 --> 33:36.400
Should you be eating all that processed
meat when you're pregnant?

33:36.560 --> 33:39.680
Can I have a coke, too?

33:41.880 --> 33:44.400
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.600
- Hello, Liv.
- Hello, Andreas.

34:04.840 --> 34:08.760
- Hey. I was just...
- Thirsty?

34:08.920 --> 34:14.239
Yes. I really don't drink a lot,
but my body wanted wine

34:14.400 --> 34:20.199
and as long as it's sulphite-free,
one glass can't hurt.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.199
- What are you knitting?
- Nursing pads.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.679
May I sit down? Nursing pads?

34:26.840 --> 34:31.480
- I thought those were disposable.
- It's better to re-use.

34:31.639 --> 34:37.600
Look what I bought.
I think it's organic. Take a look...

34:37.760 --> 34:42.320
- Isn't it adorable?
- Oh yes, it's so cute.

34:42.480 --> 34:47.159
- I'm so excited about it.
- Me, too.

34:47.320 --> 34:51.400
I'm sorry. Now my hormones
are just rushing through my body.

34:51.560 --> 34:56.760
It's okay. Cecilie is excited, too.
She's just a bit...

34:56.920 --> 35:00.200
- Tense?
- Yes. She's nervous.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.760
She has always wanted a child.

35:02.920 --> 35:07.560
We're not exactly young anymore.
She just wants it all to go well.

35:07.720 --> 35:12.960
I can understand that.
I'm glad you told me.

35:13.120 --> 35:18.120
I should be getting home. Please,
don't tell Cecilie about the dress.

35:18.280 --> 35:21.000
I'm not supposed
to buy anything for the baby until...

35:21.160 --> 35:26.080
- Of course. It was lovely to see you.
- You, too.

35:27.200 --> 35:31.920
Oh, can I just...?
Hello, darling. It's Dad.

35:32.080 --> 35:37.160
There's the lucky dad, eh?
Congratulations.

35:40.240 --> 35:42.560
Honey?

35:47.360 --> 35:49.640
- She has a cat.
- Who?

35:49.800 --> 35:53.280
- Liv. That's a no-no.
- How come?

35:53.440 --> 35:57.560
Litter boxes are full of germs!
It's dangerous for the foetus.

35:57.720 --> 36:02.880
- She's so irresponsible.
- She's nice. I just ran into her.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.120
- Oh? Where?
- Downtown.

36:06.280 --> 36:08.560
Where downtown?

36:09.760 --> 36:13.600
- At CafÃ© Karma.
- What was she doing?

36:15.280 --> 36:18.160
- Having a glass of wine.
- I knew it!

36:18.320 --> 36:21.960
Don't say anything about the wine.
It was sulphite-free!

36:22.120 --> 36:27.200
- Dinner's served.
- Malte dumpster-dived all of it.

36:27.360 --> 36:31.520
- Is it organic, then?
- Yes, all of it. Almost.

36:31.680 --> 36:35.920
It's not a good place to save.
Pesticides are poison for a foetus.

36:36.080 --> 36:38.120
I think it's kicking.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.760
How freaky that another man's
baby is hanging out in there.

36:41.920 --> 36:46.200
- It's the most beautiful thing.
- This is crazy.

36:46.360 --> 36:50.240
It's coursing through my whole body.
Can you feel it, Mum?

36:50.400 --> 36:56.000
You're growing another person.
We women are magical.

36:58.040 --> 37:03.440
That was a big one. It's crazy that
a small person is growing inside me

37:03.600 --> 37:08.200
and causing me to feel that.
I'm so glad you're here, Mum.

37:08.360 --> 37:13.160
It means so much to me
to share this experience with you.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.880
So! We're halfway there.

37:17.040 --> 37:20.400
Maybe we could all go out
and celebrate afterwards?

37:20.560 --> 37:26.440
- Yes, then we can sign the contract.
- What contract?

37:26.600 --> 37:31.800
- Oh... I thought Liv had told you.
- No...

37:31.960 --> 37:37.960
We just thought it might be nice
to formalise this whole baby swap.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.120
Why didn't you tell me?

37:42.280 --> 37:46.800
Because I needed to find out
how I feel about it.

37:46.960 --> 37:50.800
Yes, but you need
to tell me things like that.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.240
You're not back to wanting
to keep their child?

37:55.400 --> 37:58.640
No. Yes. Maybe.
I'm not sure.

37:58.800 --> 38:04.000
Well, I am 100% sure.
I want our child to look like me.

38:04.160 --> 38:09.960
- No offence. It means a lot to me.
- Yes, I understand.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.840
But what if their pregnancy goes wrong?

38:13.000 --> 38:17.240
Why would something go wrong
with me? It might as well be you.

38:17.400 --> 38:23.080
I'm not saying it will.
But you're just... a bit old.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.560
That doesn't necessarily matter.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.680
If you lose your child,
then I won't have one.

38:28.840 --> 38:34.480
Let me just say something. I think
things will go great for both of you.

38:34.640 --> 38:39.840
Of course they will.
I know it's not a perfect situation

38:40.000 --> 38:44.800
but you're taking all of us hostage
just because you have some doubts.

38:44.960 --> 38:49.120
Can we please sign that contract?
Please?

38:50.560 --> 38:53.840
Yes, all right. Let's sign it.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.400
- Okay. Thank you, honey.
- Yes!

38:57.560 --> 39:00.880
- Thank you.
- Okay, we're doing it now?

39:02.000 --> 39:05.640
- Okay, there...
- Yeah.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.040
Here.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.840
- All right. Thank you.
- Here you go.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.920
- It's kicking again.
- Can I feel it?

39:17.080 --> 39:20.520
- Oh, it's so crazy.
- "Again"?

39:20.680 --> 39:24.280
Yes. Isn't yours doing it yet?

39:24.440 --> 39:28.840
Wait, haven't you felt
any movement yet?

39:29.000 --> 39:31.960
Not...

39:32.120 --> 39:36.080
It might be because
the baby is feeling stressed.

39:36.240 --> 39:41.440
- Cecilie and Andreas Sonne.
- That's us.

39:41.600 --> 39:45.240
- Hello.
- Hello.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.480
- And hello.
- Your brought your family?

39:49.640 --> 39:53.840
So, you plan to swap
your babies after they're born?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.920
Yes, so we get our own child.

39:57.080 --> 40:01.080
So you don't feel that the baby
in your belly is really yours?

40:01.240 --> 40:03.800
We want our biological child.

40:03.960 --> 40:09.000
Is that what matters? A lot of
adopted kids would be sad to hear that.

40:09.160 --> 40:13.600
I agree completely.
No child is right or wrong.

40:13.760 --> 40:17.480
- You love the child you have.
- Well, we've signed the contract.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.960
I think you'll love the child
Cecilie gives birth to.

40:21.120 --> 40:25.480
Well, it's your choice.
Let's make sure both babies are healthy.

40:36.040 --> 40:39.640
- Would the father like to see?
- Of course.

40:39.800 --> 40:43.560
- The other one.
- Oh, right...

40:46.920 --> 40:48.680
Hello, hello.

40:48.840 --> 40:52.960
It all looks good.
Would you like to know the sex?

40:53.120 --> 40:58.280
- Yes.
- You're having a little girl.

40:58.440 --> 41:04.400
No, wait. I'm sorry.
There's a tiny little penis here.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.480
Everything looks good here.

41:07.640 --> 41:11.840
We have a little arm and a tiny hand...

41:12.000 --> 41:16.080
- And you're having a girl.
- A girl? You're sure?

41:16.240 --> 41:20.320
Some believe girls can turn out
to be decent human beings.

41:20.480 --> 41:27.000
Yes, but can you check again?
Maybe there's a tiny penis somewhere?

41:27.160 --> 41:30.760
- You could consider not swapping.
- No, it's fine.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.960
We're not so superficial
that we care about the sex.

41:34.120 --> 41:39.200
- Everything looks good this time.
- That's great. Wonderful!

41:39.360 --> 41:43.560
Then everything is just as it should be.

41:46.320 --> 41:50.520
- 10 euro for a pint...
- Hello there.

41:50.680 --> 41:56.280
It's the parents to-be.
Riesling, I assume?

41:56.440 --> 42:01.760
Riesling? No, thank you.
We're just having tap water.

42:01.920 --> 42:06.440
We're pregnant, so it would be
a bit irresponsible to drink alcohol.

42:06.600 --> 42:10.080
- A sparkling water, please.
- A cappuccino.

42:11.280 --> 42:16.080
What did he mean when he said
everything looks good this time?

42:17.040 --> 42:20.640
I don't know.
I guess it's just something you say.

42:20.800 --> 42:25.920
I thought it sounded like
you've been unlucky before.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.880
Okay. Many times before?

42:30.040 --> 42:34.640
It hasn't been an easy journey.

42:34.800 --> 42:38.800
Why didn't you tell us before we signed?

42:38.960 --> 42:41.960
What happened before?

42:42.960 --> 42:48.240
It's not very pleasant to talk about,
so let's focus on the positive now.

42:48.400 --> 42:52.680
But you can see why I might
feel very uncertain now, right?

42:52.840 --> 42:57.520
I would like to withdraw my signature.

42:57.680 --> 43:01.000
- Liv, come on...
- I do.

43:02.120 --> 43:06.480
Is there something we can do
to make you feel less uncertain?

43:06.640 --> 43:10.040
How about this. Liv, you're very...

43:10.200 --> 43:12.840
- And I'm a bit more...
- Uptight?

43:13.000 --> 43:18.280
Okay.
What if I try to live more holistically?

43:18.440 --> 43:22.920
- Would that make you feel better?
- Yes. How would you do that?

43:23.080 --> 43:28.040
Write me a list that details
what I can and can't do and eat.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.760
A list that puts me in charge?

43:30.920 --> 43:34.920
Yes. As long as we stick
to the contract, you're in charge.

43:42.320 --> 43:47.520
- Okay, that's a good idea.
- Then that's what we'll do.

43:47.680 --> 43:51.440
- That's a good plan.
- I'll make one for you, too.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.560
That's fair, isn't it?

44:02.920 --> 44:05.360
There.

44:07.320 --> 44:10.280
- Are you almost ready?
- Just a moment.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.240
There.

44:13.400 --> 44:16.800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:18.440 --> 44:21.440
Wow...
I didn't know it had to be this long.

44:21.600 --> 44:25.800
- Just put some more on there.
- I'm getting heartburn.

44:25.960 --> 44:29.960
- Would you like some almonds?
- That would be nice.

44:30.120 --> 44:35.000
"Clean the house twice a week."
We clean when it's needed.

44:35.160 --> 44:39.800
- Why does it say it's a no-go to...
- To skin a hare. It's dangerous.

44:39.960 --> 44:44.280
I would never do that.
I'm vegan.

44:44.440 --> 44:49.680
You're vegan?
Well... My baby needs meat!

44:49.840 --> 44:55.240
Then you should only eat vegan.
To maintain the balance.

44:55.400 --> 45:01.240
- It could be fun to be a vegetarian.
- I can have meat again. Yes!

45:03.600 --> 45:08.400
- "Home birth with no pain medicine"?
- The pain of childbirth is natural.

45:08.560 --> 45:14.400
- Not when it's someone else's child.
- Relax. It's not like kidney stones.

45:14.560 --> 45:18.440
You've had kidney stones, too?
They're the worst.

45:18.600 --> 45:24.760
Hey! Are you two comparing your
little kidney stones with giving birth?

45:24.920 --> 45:30.120
The natural home birth is out.
We're having our baby in the hospital.

45:30.280 --> 45:34.160
Fine, Cecilie,
then I'll veto the cleaning.

45:34.320 --> 45:40.240
- And I'm not getting rid of my cat.
- Cat poop bacteria is dangerous.

45:40.400 --> 45:43.600
- Can't your mum take him?
- She's not allowed to keep pets

45:43.760 --> 45:47.400
- Figure it out! Fix it!
- Why don't you just take him?

45:47.560 --> 45:51.680
He would love scratching up
your designer furniture.

45:51.840 --> 45:54.400
It might be fun with a practice baby.

45:54.560 --> 45:58.520
Liv doesn't want to expose
her baby to cat poop bacteria.

45:58.680 --> 46:02.120
I'd be okay with that.

46:02.280 --> 46:05.760
- That's what we'll do.
- Fine, we'll take it.

46:05.920 --> 46:08.960
- Fine.
- Yeah, great.

46:09.120 --> 46:16.080
Come here, love. Oh, Houdini...
You're just going on holiday, okay?

46:22.720 --> 46:27.240
My whole nervous system
is off balance now.

46:27.400 --> 46:31.400
What if Cecilie's genes
are stressing me from the inside?

46:31.560 --> 46:33.520
Honey...

46:33.680 --> 46:38.480
First I couldn't get pregnant,
now I can't even carry my own child.

46:38.640 --> 46:42.800
Why is this happening to me?

46:42.960 --> 46:48.280
What if we tried
to cheer your body up together?

46:50.800 --> 46:53.640
I don't want to, Malte!

46:53.800 --> 46:58.760
If you want to help, let's make
a list of all the allotment projects.

46:58.920 --> 47:04.000
- I'm working as fast as I can.
- We need to be done in time.

47:04.160 --> 47:09.200
I've got a lot to do before the baby
comes. A list for each of us seems fair.

47:09.360 --> 47:13.440
We're equals, right?
Move over.

47:21.120 --> 47:23.560
No...!

47:30.160 --> 47:34.120
- What's going on?
- I'm so tired of this hippie baby.

47:34.280 --> 47:38.200
I can't do this anymore.
It's making me ugly and huge.

47:38.360 --> 47:41.840
Don't say that. You're beautiful
just the way you are.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.720
- No.
- Yes, you are.

47:44.880 --> 47:50.000
And now we know for sure
that we'll be getting our own child.

47:50.160 --> 47:55.720
I have something that'll cheer you up.
I found Malte's app.

47:57.240 --> 48:01.280
Look how cute it's going to be.

48:01.440 --> 48:04.480
Aw...

48:19.880 --> 48:22.840
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

48:28.760 --> 48:30.680
Shoo!

48:57.440 --> 49:00.640
Hello.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.360
<i>Honey? Where are you?</i>

49:44.680 --> 49:46.640
Hey, gorgeous.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.560
Come on...

50:43.200 --> 50:47.080
- Cecilie, do you have a minute?
- Of course, Jan.

50:47.240 --> 50:50.720
I was wondering...
What's that smell?

50:50.880 --> 50:53.520
I'm sorry. I'm not using
perfume at the moment.

50:53.680 --> 50:58.120
Some believe it's unhealthy
to do so when you're pregnant.

50:58.280 --> 51:04.600
- Should Max take over your tasks?
- No. I'm not leaving for a while yet.

51:04.760 --> 51:08.240
But can you stay focused
with that big belly?

51:08.400 --> 51:12.360
Yes, it's not a problem at all.

51:13.480 --> 51:17.200
Okay.
We'll see how it goes.

51:17.360 --> 51:19.160
For a bit longer.

51:33.560 --> 51:37.520
You're right. There's a lot
I don't know about pregnancy.

51:37.680 --> 51:41.000
- Hey! What about the list?
- Who's going to tell?

51:41.160 --> 51:44.080
- The frying pan?
- You have to respect the rules.

51:49.720 --> 51:53.400
- Happy now? Or did you want it?
- No, I'm showing solidarity.

51:53.560 --> 51:59.080
Actually, the one who carries the child
determines the genetic composition.

51:59.240 --> 52:02.280
So we deliver the keys for the piano

52:02.440 --> 52:06.240
but Liv's body decides
how the melody should sound.

52:06.400 --> 52:11.320
Honey, this is just the sort of thing
I don't need to know about.

52:11.480 --> 52:17.600
Of course. I'm sorry.
We should get ready to go anyway.

52:17.760 --> 52:20.400
Let's cancel. I'm nauseous.

52:20.560 --> 52:25.480
We have to do some of the things
Liv wants to do.

52:25.640 --> 52:31.520
But... we could also do
some of the things that I want to do.

52:31.680 --> 52:34.080
Couldn't we?

52:42.480 --> 52:45.840
Liv? Can't you take a break
while we're eating?

52:46.000 --> 52:48.320
No. I need to finish
three more sets of bedding.

52:48.480 --> 52:53.160
And my mum just sent
two new knitting patterns.

52:53.320 --> 52:57.600
- Someone listed two free cupboards.
- Great. Can you reserve them?

52:57.760 --> 53:00.560
- Yes.
- Then you can install them tomorrow.

53:00.720 --> 53:05.880
I can't, it's Sunday.
I'm watching football with the boys.

53:06.040 --> 53:09.080
I'm pregnant even on Sundays.

53:09.240 --> 53:12.680
I need to pick 10,000 berries,
make baby food and bottle it.

53:12.840 --> 53:15.560
Doesn't it just need milk at first?

53:15.720 --> 53:20.800
Yes, but I need to pick berries in
summer if I want baby food for winter.

53:20.960 --> 53:24.640
Jesus,
there's a lot men don't understand.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.400
- Hello.
- Sorry we're late.

53:28.560 --> 53:32.920
- Andreas had to take care of something.
- No problem. Come on in.

53:33.080 --> 53:37.520
- Welcome.
- This place has a lot of potential.

53:37.680 --> 53:44.000
- Okay. Would you like to go first?
- No, you should. This was your idea.

53:46.040 --> 53:50.120
That looks a bit saucy, eh?
Or is it just me?

53:50.280 --> 53:54.760
- Malte, should I do this alone?
- No, no.

53:58.920 --> 54:03.560
- Hello, baby. This is your mum.
- Yes. And your dad.

54:03.720 --> 54:08.600
Yes. We're really looking forward
to meeting you.

54:08.760 --> 54:14.400
I promise to do everything I can
to be the best mum possible for you.

54:14.560 --> 54:18.280
You'll have a very harmonious childhood.

54:18.440 --> 54:24.400
We're filling up a whole allotment
house with nothing but love for you.

54:25.920 --> 54:31.080
We hope you'll be as hot as your mum
and as good at football as your dad.

54:31.240 --> 54:35.600
- Yes. And your name will be Gunilla.
- It definitely will not.

54:35.760 --> 54:38.640
Yes. That's your grandma's middle name.

54:38.800 --> 54:41.880
Liv, that sounds like an STD.

54:42.040 --> 54:46.320
- Okay. Your turn.
- Oh. Right...

54:46.480 --> 54:50.680
Give me a hand, honey.
Thank you.

54:54.440 --> 54:58.440
- All right.
- Oh, it's gorgeous.

54:58.600 --> 55:02.880
- Honey, would you like to start?
- Sure...

55:08.040 --> 55:10.280
Okay, then...

55:14.240 --> 55:17.600
Hello... baby.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.720
- Should I just...?
- Just say what you feel.

55:21.880 --> 55:26.200
Right... What I'm feeling...

55:26.360 --> 55:29.760
I'm feeling a bit of heartburn.

55:29.920 --> 55:32.040
That's probably what I feel.

55:35.000 --> 55:39.680
Right. Andreas, would you like to...
You can take over if you like?

55:39.840 --> 55:45.320
Yes. Hello. It's me, your dad.

55:45.480 --> 55:48.120
Hello, baby.

55:48.280 --> 55:53.320
I can promise you one thing. You'll be
well cared for when you come out.

55:53.480 --> 55:56.080
You'll get the best room in the house.

55:56.240 --> 55:59.400
20 square metres.
Great natural light.

55:59.560 --> 56:01.600
Access to outdoor areas.

56:01.760 --> 56:06.160
You'll be able to come and go
as you please. I mean, once you're...

56:06.320 --> 56:11.920
I just want to tell you that I look
forward to getting to know you.

56:12.080 --> 56:18.480
And it doesn't matter if you become
an astrophysicist or an ambassador.

56:19.440 --> 56:24.440
Because... You're my little darling.

56:25.840 --> 56:31.760
- Andreas, you'll be the best dad ever.
- Thank you. That's really sweet.

56:31.920 --> 56:35.280
That was really good.

56:35.440 --> 56:38.920
Can I help you?

56:39.880 --> 56:42.600
What the hell are you doing?

56:44.640 --> 56:49.120
Your ketchup
is going to expire in one week.

56:49.280 --> 56:52.600
- Are you snooping?
- She's eating our roast beef.

56:52.760 --> 56:57.720
- You're not eating meat, are you?
- Should we call it a day?

56:57.880 --> 57:01.560
- Thank you for having us.
- May I use the bathroom?

57:05.680 --> 57:11.000
This is a very authentic hallway.
Very patinated.

57:11.160 --> 57:14.800
- All right, honey...
- These are not the pills from the list.

57:14.960 --> 57:17.640
Did you smell my used underwear, too?

57:17.800 --> 57:21.840
Take it easy.
Cecilie, I get all the vitamins I need.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.840
- These don't contain vitamin D.
- It's summer. I get it from the sun.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.080
- Folate?
- Dried bananas.

57:29.240 --> 57:31.440
- Iron?
- You're making me eat meat.

57:31.600 --> 57:36.000
Liv, I want us to stick
to the agreement and the lists.

57:36.160 --> 57:42.560
Getting so worked up is not good
for the baby. Take a deep breath...

57:50.120 --> 57:52.440
That wasn't very smart, honey.

57:52.600 --> 57:56.040
How about we cut out
these babies now, then?!

57:56.200 --> 57:59.760
Caesareans aren't ideal.
It's much better for the baby

57:59.920 --> 58:03.560
to be covered in the mum's
vagina grease... or the vernix.

58:03.720 --> 58:07.840
So the first thing my baby will see
is her greasy hippie vagina?

58:08.000 --> 58:09.280
Calm down...

58:09.440 --> 58:12.000
Tell me to calm down
and I'll break your face.

58:15.120 --> 58:17.040
I thought we were going to a bar.

58:17.200 --> 58:20.520
We'll have a quick look
while they're at the baby shower.

58:20.680 --> 58:24.200
If you insist on contributing
to overconsumption.

58:24.360 --> 58:28.560
Look at that.
I love unicorns.

58:33.960 --> 58:39.000
Malte, is Liv also initiating a lot?

58:39.160 --> 58:42.920
- In bed.
- You mean is she horny?

58:43.080 --> 58:46.520
No. That would be an overstatement.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.400
- Why? Is Cecilie?
- Yes.

58:49.560 --> 58:55.000
- Okay. So you're doing it all the time?
- Yeah. She wants me all the time.

58:55.160 --> 59:00.240
It's a bit awkward with
the big belly and all, but it's just...

59:00.400 --> 59:02.800
Let me make sure I understand...

59:02.960 --> 59:07.280
You're pumping your penis straight
into my baby's face every day?

59:08.240 --> 59:11.600
No, my penis isn't nearly that long.

59:11.760 --> 59:14.240
And the baby's bum is still facing down.

59:14.400 --> 59:17.960
That's even worse!
Bloody hell, it's my little girl!

59:18.120 --> 59:21.080
- But isn't it normal?
- Hell no!

59:21.240 --> 59:24.400
It's the most grotesque threesome
in the world!

59:24.560 --> 59:27.880
- Disgusting!
- I didn't think about it like that.

59:28.040 --> 59:31.880
- So you'd like us to stop?
- Yes, please!

59:32.040 --> 59:36.080
- Cecilie might be a bit upset.
- I don't care!

59:36.240 --> 59:39.600
We don't fuck and you don't fuck. Period.

59:39.760 --> 59:44.840
- So just fingering?
- No! No fingering!

59:47.560 --> 59:51.680
- I'm getting this one.
- I'm sorry I yelled.

59:54.680 --> 59:59.040
Hello.
You're here on a Saturday, too?

59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.760
- Of course. Always.
- Right.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:24.240
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.160
Hello.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.280
Hello, Liv.
Oh, you've brought your mum.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.920
Of course! Grandma should be here.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.560
This is quite the elaborate circus show
you've set up here, eh?

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.280
That looks beautiful, Mette-Line.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:49.920
Oh yes. We've brought a cake, too.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.080
Oh. What do we have here?

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.720
It's a vagina cake.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.520
Aha...

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.760
Looks like someone's missed you.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.480
Hello, little love.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.920
- This one is nice.
- Can I help you?

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:18.320
I'm looking for a pram. Do you have
the test winner from Stokke?

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:25.160
Yes, but let me show you another one.
This one from Bugaboo is very popular.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:29.880
- Bugaboo?
- This little bag is nice.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:35.520
Then you can bring some nappies
and snacks along.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.840
What does your husband think?

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.920
Husband?

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.800
Oh, you're not married?

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.280
No, his wife is just...

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.720
Pregnant with his baby.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.880
Yes.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.920
- Maybe it's time to call it a day?
- No.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:21.680
- I'm doing an all-nighter.
- Right.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:34.560
- You're leaving after all?
- I'm babysitting my niece.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:38.560
- That sounds nice. Enjoy your day.
- You too.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.040
I need to...

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.160
<i>- Welcome to Safe Start Clinic.</i>
- I need to talk to...

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.160
<i>You're on hold as number... 37.</i>

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:27.240
<i>Spotting during pregnancy is normal.
There's no need to worry.</i>

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.000
Surprise!

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.280
- I didn't want a baby shower.
- Of course you did.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.520
Mette-Line went through so much trouble.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.680
Ta-da!

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.960
- Come on.
- Yeah.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.720
You'll be blindfolded and then
you have to guess the baby food.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.680
- What's that?
- Peach.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.120
One point! You're doing great!

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.000
- Something with peas?
- No. Boo!

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:09.960
No, thank you. I'll skip it.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.520
- I just need to...
- Stay here. We need a picture.

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:23.280
Can you turn around?
Here we go.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.880
Go, Cecilie! Go, Cecilie!

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.560
You'll need your looks back
at some point.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.200
Start working out right after
the birth or everything will stay saggy.

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.080
- Here you go.
- Another one.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.320
It's a swaddle.
It's the only way to avoid colic.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.480
Yes, and it reduces the risk of SIDS.

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.800
- I read it increases the risk.
- No, Irene is right.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.960
Of course I am.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.760
And remember:
Don't feed the baby whole grapes.

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:21.560
- Or nuts for the first two years.
- Or cinnamon. Or honey.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.920
- My turn. Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.360
You're welcome.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.680
- They're self-cleaning.
- What are those?

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:37.080
- Nursing pads. I made them myself
- It's the only way to do it.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.880
- Cecilie won't be breast feeding.
- What?

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.560
Mastitis is very common.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:47.080
My second cousin's friend
got sores and a fungal infection.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:52.000
But... you should nurse if you can.
It's best for the baby.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:57.640
- Formula is just as good.
- But you miss out on the intimacy.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.800
Andreas will appreciate his wife
having firm breasts after giving birth.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.960
I breastfed Liv until she was four.
My breasts are fine.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.920
What if you give birth before me?
Won't you breastfeed my baby?

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.320
No! If she won't breastfeed her own,
why would she breastfeed yours?

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.400
It's a bit nasty to watch your child
munching on someone else's breasts.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.160
- It's almost paedophilia.
- Nonsense!

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:29.160
If my milk could come in,
I'd love to offer a breast.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.440
Oh God...

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.400
I need to use the bathroom.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.880
<i>This is Andreas Sonne.
Leave a message.</i>

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.120
Hey.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.160
Are you okay?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
I told them
I didn't want this baby shower.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:16.120
They were inconsiderate, then.
You've been through enough.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.600
I'm tired of people's opinions
about what I can and can't do.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.360
I know what you mean.
It's really stressful.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:30.560
But we're almost there, right?

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.360
Liv, I...

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.720
Is she kicking?

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.880
Oh!

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:56.920
Wow!

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:05.640
It's starting over here now, too.
It's the craziest sensation, right?

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:11.200
Don't you feel more connected to it
now that you can feel it's alive?

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:15.880
- Don't you?
- It was just a little kick.

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:20.720
- But Cecilie...
- I won't change my mind.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:31.880
Can't we agree to keep seeing
each other after the babies are born?

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:37.359
- Maybe they'll be friends.
- They won't have much in common.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.279
- What are you doing?
- The baby kicked.

01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:48.640
Finally! Oh, how wonderful!

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:55.240
Imagine how wonderful it would feel
if it were actually your own!

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.399
Hello.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.800
Hey, honey. I was thinking we
should start working on the nursery.

01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:24.720
- Let's decide on colours...
- Not now.

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:33.319
Could you...?

01:09:33.479 --> 01:09:38.640
- So?
- Honey? I'm not really in the mood.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:45.800
- Aren't you attracted to me anymore?
- Yes.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:51.040
Do you realise how hard it is
to be so damn horny all the time?

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:54.120
- What happened?
- I think my water broke.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:57.000
- But it's much too early.
- Yes.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.560
Good morning.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.840
Good morning, Ulla.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.200
- Good morning, love.
- Good morning.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:19.680
- Weren't we taking a day off?
- Yes, but...

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.960
Can't you go to the allotment?
You need to work on the deck.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.880
Oh yes, how is that deck coming along?

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.840
It's coming along fine. Thanks, Ulla.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.320
- See you.
- See you...

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.360
- Is something wrong?
- I don't know if I want to swap.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.840
It feels like Cecilie
gets to decide everything.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.520
I wish I hadn't signed that contract.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.800
- Yes, that was silly.
- Well, I did it for Malte.

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.680
I wish I could be allowed to choose

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:09.520
which baby feels most like mine
once they're born.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.160
You deserve that.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.120
We'll figure out a solution together.
You and me. All right?

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.720
- This is Liv.
<i>- My water broke!</i>

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.120
- What's up, Cecilie?
- It's too early!

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:34.400
Let's have a look at it.
Aren't you missing a dad?

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:38.560
- Yes, but grandma is here.
- Jakob, will you take a look?

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.960
What's your assessment?
Are we in the latent phase?

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.280
- No, it's a false alarm.
- Her water broke.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:54.400
It's not water.
Have you had issues with incontinence?

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.560
You've wet yourself.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:03.520
Mum...

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.280
- Take it easy going forward.
- I feel fine.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.400
Just take care of yourself.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.800
You want to have a baby to swap, right?

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.960
Honey? Honey!

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.160
Andreas, I can't...
There's no heartbeat.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.240
I can't...

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:48.040
Honey, the battery died.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.400
Hey! The baby is fine, okay?

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:58.000
Come back to bed.
There. Everything is okay.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.320
We're doing rebozo exercises soon.
You can start revising.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.680
It's not working. Take it back.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.400
You're such a wriggly little rascal.
Aren't you done in there yet?

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.160
Now I have a cramp!

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.880
- Would you like my pine ointment?
- No, thank you.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.720
- It's important to listen to your body.
- I'm listening.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:33.200
It's saying it feels great.
It's wonderful to be pregnant!

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.560
- It looks like you're struggling a bit.
- Yes, it does.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.760
Well, I'm not. I'm completely relaxed.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.320
Everyone tells me I'm glowing.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:50.320
Okay. I actually also think
it's wonderful to be pregnant.

01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:53.280
Especially since I haven't
gained any weight.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:57.520
Well, you were on the larger side
to begin with.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:00.640
Now it's the other way around.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.680
- I have no stretch marks!
- I haven't been sick at all.

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.800
- My hair is so thick!
- I'm happy all the time.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:11.280
This little angel is getting
more attached to me every day.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.920
Everyone tells me that I'm glowing!
I'm glowing!

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.400
You just said that!
You can't say it again!

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:23.160
Hey, all this yelling
isn't good for the babies.

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.920
- Wow, she's so uptight.
- What the hell is her problem?

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.560
Hey, honey!

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.680
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:48.680
- The deck is finished. Want to see it?
- I have too many things I need to do.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.800
Ow, ow...

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.560
It's lucky
that I took care of this, then.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:01.560
- You're so sweet.
- Unwrap it.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.560
- These are flat.
- Yes. They're supposed to be the best.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.760
No, the round ones are best. Everyone
knows that. They aren't even organic.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:19.360
Organic? But...

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.720
- Would you like one?
- No, thanks.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:35.040
Anders, take one of these.
I know you're busy.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.960
- Charlotte?
- Sorry, I don't have time.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.840
- Hey! I have strawberries, too.
- Hello, Cecilie.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.120
- How exciting.
- Did you get my e-mail?

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.680
- Yes.
- Good. All the documents are filed.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:55.080
- I've got it under control.
- Just enjoy your mummy holiday.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.280
- Thank you. Would you like one?
- No, thanks.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.960
- Max, do you have a minute?
- Yes. Enjoy your holiday.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.680
Everything looks good.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:23.880
The baby is being
a bit of an arse over here.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.000
He is breach.
How do you feel about a caesarean?

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:34.040
I don't want a caesarean. I want
a natural birth like a primal woman.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.520
But if a caesarean is necessary...

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.160
You are not taking this
experience away from me.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.840
- A breech delivery is possible.
- No!

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.960
You are not endangering my child's life
for some stone age fantasy!

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:53.360
There's another option.
We can try to turn him over.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.080
Yes.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:03.080
Okay, Liv. Let's try.
Say the word if it's too much.

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:06.240
Let's lift the baby off the pelvis.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.520
Hanne, I need a hand here.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.760
- If something happens to my baby...
- They have it under control.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:17.880
- This might hurt. Are you okay?
- Yes.

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.560
I'll take it from here.
Come on. Yes!

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.960
The head is down, Liv!
We've turned him over.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:33.600
- It worked!
- Well done. You were amazing.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.640
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:43.560
- Now you can have a natural birth.
- Thank you.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.800
Are you okay? You want to sit up?

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.800
She got her way again. Typical.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.720
That's enough!

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.320
My whole pregnancy has revolved
around your insane Nazi rules!

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.640
The only insanity is all
your alternative hocus pocus.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:08.880
Fuck you! You're the least
harmonic person I have ever met.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.880
I don't want a child that you made.
I'll keep this one.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.440
You can't. We've signed a contract.

01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:21.640
In this country you have a legal right
to the child you give birth to.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.920
You have no say in this!

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:30.200
My mum's friend's daughter is a lawyer,
too. She specialises in family law.

01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:36.600
She's been through the whole thing.
I'm keeping this child if I want to!

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:39.360
What the hell is happening? Liv!

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:44.640
- Isn't the contract legally binding?
- Yes... No.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:49.000
- Are you lying?
- She just ran off with our baby!

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:53.640
I actually empathise with her.
You're pushing everyone away.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.080
You've pushed me away. I've done
everything to make you comfortable.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.680
But you have no consideration
for others. It's all about you!

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.800
Congratulations. You've taken away
all the joy of our pregnancy!

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:17.120
Liv. Liv! Hey!

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.160
- You're really breaking the contract?
- Yes.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.840
- She doesn't get to be in charge.
- Doesn't my opinion matter?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.080
It's important to me that our child
will be a combination of you and me.

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:37.720
I have no relationship with that child.
You can't make this decision alone.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.120
- I'm the one who's pregnant!
- Yes, you've made that clear.

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:46.800
- You're not letting me be a part of it.
- You can't do anything right!

01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:52.880
Are you even interested in this?
My mum is more dedicated than you are.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:58.480
You and your mum! You didn't even
bother to tell me about the contract!

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.480
She's all over the place!
There isn't room for me.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:06.320
So now I should feel sorry for you?
This is so typical of men.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.880
You know what?
I'm going to the allotment.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.920
I can assemble
your 5,000 plant boxes, right?

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:22.320
You can think about whether
you even want your child to have a dad.

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.880
So we risk getting
an ergonomic hippie baby?

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.400
- This is insane!
- This can't happen.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.840
- Hi, Auntie!
- Hey, Jose!

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.240
Be careful, Josefine!

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:52.320
Don't bump into your aunt's belly.
There's actually a baby in there.

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.320
It's all right.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:00.320
I told her to be more careful.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:31.080
- She's impossible to put to sleep.
- Aw...

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:35.280
<i>Mummy! Mummy!</i>

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.080
You can't keep running
back and forth like that.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.400
You can't give in.
They just want attention.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.600
I certainly didn't give in to you two.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.840
<i>Mummy, can you please come in here?</i>

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.920
- What's wrong, darling?
- What if the baby died?

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:25.320
- Why would it have died?
- Because I hugged your belly so hard.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:33.280
Darling, it's all right. The baby
just had a bit of a roller coaster ride.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:37.560
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm sure.

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:44.040
Wait here a minute.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.680
Okay. Put this in your ear.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.080
- Is that the baby?
- Yes. It's crazy, isn't it?

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:28.280
Auntie, may I hold the baby when it
gets here? I promise to be careful.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:32.480
Yes, you may. Of course.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:38.840
- I'm really excited about it.
- You know what? Me, too.

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:45.480
I'm really excited, too.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:59.440
- She's not prepared for the baby.
- Is the house even child proof?

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.440
- They haven't secured the stairs yet.
- It could end in disaster!

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:09.200
Even small children get hurt.
They get burnt, drown, fall down stairs.

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.800
- I've told her. She doesn't listen.
- She doesn't listen to me either.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:39.040
No! Fucking...!

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.960
Malte?

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:55.200
Oh, you're home.
I've just found this amazing fabric.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:58.040
It's perfect for a onesie.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:02.520
- Sweetie, this place needs cleaning.
- Mum, I don't have the energy...

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:07.000
What is it? Hormones?
Or is it Malte?

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.400
Don't put up with anything, okay?

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:15.120
Stop criticising Malte! He's my partner,
and he'll be a great dad.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:20.680
You do it because you love me, but
you need to stop meddling in everything.

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.240
I don't want to stress about being a
perfect mum before I've even started.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:32.840
Malte and I will do this our way,
and it'll just have to work out, okay?

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.760
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:45.080
Andreas?

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.640
Andreas!

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.600
Hey.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:21.520
- Hello?
- Hey.

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.320
Oh...

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:28.520
I just wanted to drop off some paint.
No point in wasting it.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:33.520
Thanks. I think that contains
too many chemicals for Liv.

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.240
She's probably already mixed her own
shit brown herbal paint. But thanks.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.080
Is your woman
in charge of everything, too?

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.880
<i>This is Andreas Sonne.
Leave a message.</i>

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.040
Hey, honey. I'm really sorry.
Where are you?

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.360
Can you give me a call?

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:02.560
Come on...

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.200
It's just elderflower juice,
so the pregnancy police can lay off.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.280
May I?

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:31.560
Sure.

01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.840
- May we have two glasses of Riesling?
- You bet.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.360
- Small glasses, please.
- Of course.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:59.280
Before we did fertility treatment,
I got pregnant.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.560
The natural way.

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:10.040
Andreas was over the moon. But...

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.560
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.600
But then I miscarried.

01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:25.200
The doctors said it was normal
and that we should just try again.

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:32.360
Then I miscarried again...
and again and again.

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.440
The last time
I made it halfway.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.720
After that I couldn't get pregnant.

01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.240
No one could tell me what was wrong.

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:03.240
But, I mean... You're right.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.840
I'm a bit old.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.120
And I should have started sooner.

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:17.400
You couldn't have known ahead of time
that it would be so difficult.

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:24.520
Sometimes I think that maybe
I just don't deserve to be a mum.

01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:27.520
Of course you deserve it.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.040
Okay?

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:34.520
I mean...
Maybe you just needed some help

01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:39.360
from my fresh, young,
hocus pocus uterus.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.680
You might become a much better mum
precisely because you're older.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:52.520
My mum was 22 when she had me.
She never knew what she was doing.

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:55.760
What about your dad?

01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:00.120
I've never really known him.
He left when I was two.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.320
She's never been
very good at relationships.

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:08.760
I didn't think I was either.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.280
But now you have Malte.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.040
Yes... I hope so anyway.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:26.000
I've lost myself in this chaos.
I almost can't stand to be in my body.

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.840
Want to swap?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.160
I'm tired of being
such a hysterical...

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.440
- Bitch?
- Should we really call it that?

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.400
Some might.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.360
No, you're not a bitch.
You're just behaving like one.

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:50.520
I think I've just been scared.
No one understands how hard this is.

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:54.720
My sister has probably had sex twice,
and she got two children out of it.

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:59.400
I've been through a fertility treatment
from hell and a fucked up pregnancy.

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:02.120
- I just feel so...
- Cheated.

01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:05.160
Yes, cheated. And alone.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:10.280
Andreas is wonderful.
And he does what he can, but...

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:14.880
You probably can't understand
unless you've tried it.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.640
- Oh. I think my water broke.
- Now?

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:11.720
Is it Cecilie's or your fault
you can't do it naturally?

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:15.680
It's not anyone's fault.
Is that how you see it?

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:17.600
I don't know.

01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:22.840
I've just always felt
like a failure in all of this.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.280
I've always thought I could do anything.

01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:35.000
But I couldn't even get my girlfriend
pregnant. What am I good for, then?

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:40.240
It's not fair for Liv to exclude you.
She's not the only one who's pregnant.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:46.080
- You both are.
- You're still on your own on that one.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:53.680
- This is really good.
- Yeah. It's a regular Tuborg.

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:03.560
You're only dilated five cm and we have
three acute cases. I'll be back later.

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.400
You're leaving?

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.240
- Where is Andreas?
- He's not answering his phone.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.480
- What is your body feeling right now?
- It's feeling...

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.080
Like it's about to take a huge shit!

01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:24.000
Do you hear a wailing note, too?

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.400
- No.
- Listen...

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:32.080
<i>- Malte!</i>
- Aren't you just drunk?

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:34.920
Malte! Malte!

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:39.600
Malte, don't you answer your phone?
She's in labour!

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:43.160
- She's in labour?
- Come on!

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:48.120
But... which one?
Which one is in labour?

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.520
Yes. Oh, that's it.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.960
No, I don't want that!

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:14.080
No, take it off.
I feel a contraction coming.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:17.680
Okay, come on. That's good.

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:23.520
Okay. Breathe in.
And... breathe out.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:28.160
How are we doing here?
I'll get some laughing gas for the pain.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.840
I want an epidural!

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:36.280
- Let's start with the laughing gas.
- Breathe. Three, four, five...

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.160
- Look up.
- Stop it! Yuck!

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:44.320
- If feels nice.
- Help her take a big breath of this.

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:50.520
- You're doing great. I'll be back.
- You're leaving? I don't want that!

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:54.320
It's good. Relax.
Look, I'm taking some.

01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:58.600
That's really nice.

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:07.800
- We're taking my car.
- You're not coming.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:12.280
Of course I am.
Liv needs her mum.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:15.880
Liv needs her partner.
Come on. Get in.

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:18.800
- In that?
- Yes, come on.

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:25.240
Ulla, I promise I'll call you
as soon as you're a grandma, okay?

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.200
Yeah...

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.880
Let's go! It's happening!
We're going to be a dad!

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.560
I can't believe I wet myself.

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:50.560
I can't believe I ate half a pig!

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.160
- I can't believe I did, too, in secret!
- No way!

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.640
You didn't...

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.880
You know who you look like
during contractions? Your mum!

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:05.200
You're so mean.

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.840
You're so annoyingly perfect!

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.880
Do perfect people get
gigantic haemorrhoids?

01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:22.000
- Why did no one tell us about that?
- Because then no one would do this.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.400
There's a head down there.

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:29.040
- I need a grownup now!
- Calm down.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.400
Your body is made to give birth.
You're a warrior. A primal woman!

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:39.560
Yes, I'm a ninja, and...
Ow, there's so much pressure!

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.520
- Hurry.
- We're here.

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:48.760
Push. The head is almost out.

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:52.400
One more contraction.
Well done.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:56.480
There you go.
Great job. Breathe, breathe...

01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.880
All right...

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.280
And there we go.

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:07.640
You did it. Congratulations.
It's a little girl. I'll get her ready.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.640
Is it in here?

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.720
Hey.

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.640
Honey, wow...
You're amazing.

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:26.600
Wow.

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.480
- Here you go.
- Hey, darling.

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.720
There you are, my little love.

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:45.200
I'm your mum.

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.680
Are you sure?

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:56.040
Yes.

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.680
Hello.

01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:03.760
That's your dad.

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:07.840
The best dad in the world.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:14.640
- Incredible needlework.
- Thank you.

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:19.840
Hello, darling. Hello.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.160
Hey, gorgeous.

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.560
- Hello, Gunilla.
- Seriously?

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:30.440
I think we'll go with something else.
How about...

01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.400
Sille?

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.800
We may as well go all in
and embrace the chaos.

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:44.600
Have you discussed
what to do about feeding?

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:51.200
I think we'll go all in.

01:38:51.360 --> 01:38:54.840
Okay, darling. Here we go.

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:03.680
- Come here...
- Try letting her root on her own.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:09.600
Come on. There...

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:16.160
We'll be coming to the allotment
to make sure you take good care of her.

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.800
We'd love that.

01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:21.560
Sille could use a bonus mum.

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:26.040
- You can be her god mother.
- She's not getting baptised.

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:29.880
- Of course she is.
- Yes. My whole family is baptised.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:33.880
- My son is not getting baptised.
- I agree with Andreas.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:37.080
- We don't believe in God.
- It's just a ritual.

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.280
You can't force a religion on a child.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.200
I don't see it as a religious ritual...

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.320
Come to the table.
Let's have some cake.

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.320
- High five.
- Cake is served.

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:07.760
Oh, cake!

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.800
Oh, no...

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:40.400
There, there, darling!

01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.920
Is that for me?
Thank you.

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:50.440
Very nice...
How about some whipped cream?

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:19.840
ID number 061290.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:23.480
Cecilie was the nice one, right?

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:28.280
If you like hysterical women, then yes.

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:30.400
0612...

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:33.960
120680... Should we check this again?

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.640
It's too late now. We'll assume they
love the children they ended up with.
