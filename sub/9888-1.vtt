02:50.440 --> 02:52.476
Richard, don't go out too far.

02:52.859 --> 02:54.531
Em's a fraidy cat!

02:54.695 --> 02:56.413
Richard! Emmeline!

02:58.156 --> 03:00.272
Come back here this minute.

03:00.450 --> 03:01.963
And be careful.

03:03.203 --> 03:05.512
What's gotten into you, Richard?

03:05.706 --> 03:08.618
Bad enough to endanger yourself,
but to encourage Emmeline...

03:08.834 --> 03:10.347
I'm sorry, Father.

03:10.502 --> 03:12.652
I know you want to have fun.

03:13.464 --> 03:17.457
All I'm trying to do is get us all
to San Francisco in one piece.

03:17.759 --> 03:20.398
Will Mommy be coming to San Fr'isco?

03:21.138 --> 03:22.776
I don't believe so, Richard.

03:22.932 --> 03:25.241
I told you. Once they go to heaven...

03:25.434 --> 03:28.392
they don't come back.
Isn't that right, Uncle Arthur?

03:28.604 --> 03:30.720
My mommy and daddy haven't come back.

03:30.899 --> 03:33.288
Because God wants them to stay...

03:33.485 --> 03:35.715
and do his work and wait for the day...

03:35.903 --> 03:38.975
when you will take
the long voyage to see them.

03:39.198 --> 03:40.870
When will that be?

03:41.409 --> 03:43.081
When you've lived a full life...

03:43.244 --> 03:45.394
and experienced all
that it has to offer.

03:45.580 --> 03:46.695
Look!

03:51.544 --> 03:53.455
Father, what are they called?

03:53.630 --> 03:54.619
Sharks.

03:54.756 --> 03:58.795
I wish I had a hook. I'd pull 'em aboard
and the cook would fry 'em for dinner.

04:27.415 --> 04:30.612
Captain, do you know
there's a fog bank coming in?

04:31.251 --> 04:33.003
I'm aware of that fact, sir.

04:33.171 --> 04:36.208
I heard one of the men say
those storms rounding the cape...

04:36.424 --> 04:38.335
pushed us far west of our course.

04:38.509 --> 04:42.263
That's right, sir.
Last night's celestial puts us about here.

04:51.981 --> 04:54.370
Richard, what are you looking at?

04:58.572 --> 05:00.847
They don't have any clothes on.

05:04.077 --> 05:08.309
What the hell are you two doing here?
I'll teach you, bucko!

05:09.291 --> 05:10.440
Come here.

05:12.127 --> 05:13.765
Don't you dare hurt him.

05:15.339 --> 05:17.136
You want a hiding, too, do you?

05:17.299 --> 05:19.494
- Fire!
- Fire?

05:20.470 --> 05:21.903
Did somebody say "fire"?

05:24.806 --> 05:27.240
Man the pumps.

05:29.646 --> 05:30.920
- Button.
- Yes, sir?

05:31.064 --> 05:34.420
Take the children and Mr. Lestrange
and row them away from the ship.

05:34.651 --> 05:35.401
Come on.

05:36.445 --> 05:37.798
Mr. Lestrange.

05:38.153 --> 05:41.225
There's blasting powder in that hold.
I saw them load it.

05:44.452 --> 05:46.488
Keep moving!

05:51.042 --> 05:52.680
Come on, will you?

05:56.923 --> 05:57.719
Come on, you.

05:57.841 --> 05:58.671
Uncle Arthur!

05:59.843 --> 06:01.276
Richard! Emmeline!

06:01.470 --> 06:03.301
- This way, Lestrange.
- The children!

06:03.471 --> 06:06.269
They've already taken their leave.
Follow me, sir.

06:09.519 --> 06:11.350
No, there is no more room.

06:11.521 --> 06:12.874
Lower away!

06:15.274 --> 06:16.707
Abandon ship!

06:23.867 --> 06:25.346
Don't explode yet!

06:30.207 --> 06:31.276
Further.

06:31.792 --> 06:34.067
What's happening? I can't see.

06:35.213 --> 06:37.727
- What was that?
- The ship. Cover your faces.

06:40.592 --> 06:41.820
Richard!

06:43.012 --> 06:44.286
Emmeline!

06:45.097 --> 06:46.530
Uncle Arthur!

06:47.059 --> 06:48.128
There they are!

06:48.268 --> 06:49.417
Where?

06:49.602 --> 06:50.796
Captain, over here.

06:50.937 --> 06:51.972
Richard!

06:52.563 --> 06:54.235
Hello.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.594
Father!

06:57.234 --> 06:59.304
Don't go shouting both at once.

06:59.988 --> 07:02.058
I won't know which way to steer.

07:02.741 --> 07:05.255
Longboat, ahoy! Where are you?

07:11.416 --> 07:13.646
Hello!

07:17.673 --> 07:18.867
Father!

07:27.766 --> 07:28.881
Gone.

07:35.983 --> 07:37.416
Lord, help us.

08:18.985 --> 08:20.179
Where is Father?

08:22.280 --> 08:23.679
What is your name?

08:23.823 --> 08:27.338
Paddy Button. Now, belay your questions.
Can't you see I'm busy?

08:28.953 --> 08:30.989
Damn it. No food or water.

08:33.542 --> 08:36.419
That's Chopin. I can play it on the piano.

08:41.926 --> 08:44.394
Mr. Button, can I ask you a question?

08:44.844 --> 08:45.833
Yes.

08:45.971 --> 08:47.609
Are you a pirate?

08:54.939 --> 08:56.338
I'm thirsty.

08:57.775 --> 08:59.003
Me, too.

09:00.236 --> 09:01.510
Listen...

09:02.154 --> 09:04.952
you'll hear it hiss
when it touches the water.

09:07.035 --> 09:09.265
- You hear it?
- I think so.

09:09.454 --> 09:11.285
I don't hear anything.

09:11.914 --> 09:15.270
Listen harder.
It must be fairly boilin' by now.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.773
There. Do you hear it?

09:17.921 --> 09:20.515
I hear it. Don't you hear it now, Em?

09:20.715 --> 09:22.546
I think so.

09:23.343 --> 09:24.662
Yes, I hear it.

09:57.587 --> 09:59.145
I smell flowers.

10:00.798 --> 10:02.311
Flowers?

10:09.349 --> 10:11.704
Mr. Button! Richard! Look!

10:15.730 --> 10:17.049
It's land!

10:17.565 --> 10:18.793
Land!

10:19.192 --> 10:22.184
We're saved.
I would never have believed it.

11:41.276 --> 11:42.470
Where are we?

11:43.737 --> 11:48.288
Nirvana, that's where we are. No more
"yes, sir," "no, sir," for Paddy Button.

11:49.410 --> 11:52.447
No more breaking my back
over a stinkin' stove.

11:54.456 --> 11:56.412
Will Father be coming to fetch us?

11:56.584 --> 11:57.983
Come on, let's look around.

12:23.237 --> 12:24.875
Listen.

12:27.490 --> 12:28.809
Come on.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.399
I knew it.

12:38.293 --> 12:39.612
It's lovely.

12:40.170 --> 12:42.525
Water.

12:51.056 --> 12:53.047
Down there! Look out below!

13:26.051 --> 13:29.009
Mr. Button, there's a barrel over here...

13:29.220 --> 13:32.815
with funny stuff in it
that smells like the Captain's breath.

13:33.391 --> 13:35.188
The Captain's breath?

13:40.524 --> 13:42.082
It's rum.

13:43.110 --> 13:44.828
Sweet Jesus.

13:48.448 --> 13:51.440
Look what a funny thing I found.
It's got holes in it.

13:52.035 --> 13:54.754
Give me that. Where did you get it?

13:58.751 --> 14:00.901
- What was it?
- We'd better get out of here.

14:01.086 --> 14:02.678
There's a bunch of them up there.

14:02.838 --> 14:04.954
Come on, let's get out of here.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.853
Hurry it up, will you?

14:17.562 --> 14:19.632
I don't see Father's boat.

14:21.273 --> 14:24.743
No, not yet. Maybe he'll be along later.

14:26.487 --> 14:27.806
Maybe not.

14:33.161 --> 14:34.992
Take them things out of your mouth!

14:35.164 --> 14:37.883
Open your mouth!
Take them out of your mouth!

14:38.083 --> 14:39.880
Spit them out! Go on!

14:42.378 --> 14:45.097
Don't cry. I ain't mad at you.

14:45.507 --> 14:49.102
If you eat them berries, you'll go to sleep.
You'll never wake up again.

14:49.344 --> 14:52.222
They're never-wake-up berries, you see?

14:55.851 --> 14:58.604
Just leave them berries alone. Come on.

15:00.897 --> 15:04.890
We had a cat once
that went to sleep and never woke up.

15:05.987 --> 15:08.376
Uncle Arthur said she was dead and buried.

15:08.573 --> 15:12.088
Mr. Button, do you think she ate
some of those berries?

15:12.576 --> 15:13.725
Maybe.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.828
What does it really mean, Paddy,
"dead and buried"?

15:18.708 --> 15:22.018
It means that they put you in the ground
and they cover you up.

15:22.253 --> 15:24.926
And you're dead and buried, do you see?

15:25.506 --> 15:28.100
Like Mrs. Jones' baby. Remember, Em?

15:28.593 --> 15:31.471
The doctor dug it out of the cabbage patch.

15:31.846 --> 15:32.961
The cabbage patch?

15:33.097 --> 15:36.567
That's right.
But he took it back and planted it again.

15:36.809 --> 15:39.562
So it could grow and turn into an angel.

15:39.896 --> 15:42.729
I got a trowel
and dug our cabbage patch all up.

15:42.941 --> 15:45.819
But there weren't any babies or any angels.

15:46.778 --> 15:48.131
Only worms.

15:55.745 --> 15:57.975
What's in them pictures, Richard?

15:58.164 --> 16:01.600
It's a story about these funny people
who get married.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.114
There is a saying under each one.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.101
Give us a look.

16:13.096 --> 16:14.211
Yeah.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.850
Were you ever married, Paddy?

16:20.020 --> 16:21.373
Seven times.

16:21.522 --> 16:25.754
Kids in every port from Callao to Macao.
Seventeen at the last count.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.969
Never set eyes on a single of them.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.634
Slanted-eyed little devils...

16:30.781 --> 16:34.535
black little devils,
even a couple of pink ones like you.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.583
And all with my eyes.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.078
Paddy, what's "subjugation"?

16:43.753 --> 16:46.472
Something I've been trying to avoid
all my life.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.436
Come back here. This ain't gonna hurt you.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.924
We don't want to go swimming!
We don't have our bathing costumes!

16:56.141 --> 16:57.893
To hell with your bathing costumes!

16:58.060 --> 17:00.449
You don't wear them
when you have a bath, do you?

17:00.646 --> 17:02.955
This isn't a bathtub. This is the ocean!

17:16.828 --> 17:19.626
Ready, go. That's it.

17:23.794 --> 17:26.752
Whenever you see a ship,
you run down quick...

17:27.006 --> 17:29.998
and you light the signal fire.
Do you hear me?

17:32.303 --> 17:35.773
There's the rabbit hole...

17:37.976 --> 17:41.605
There's a fox, see. Pull it tight.
There's a knot. Do it.

17:52.616 --> 17:56.404
Run your finger up like that.
You shove that around under there.

18:07.631 --> 18:10.065
There you are. Put it there, shipmate.

18:17.307 --> 18:18.979
Where'd you find that?

18:19.184 --> 18:22.301
I didn't find it.
I made it from the knots you taught me.

18:22.521 --> 18:24.637
You made it? Well...

18:25.900 --> 18:27.731
pity it's not a bit bigger.

18:27.902 --> 18:29.460
Let's go swimming.

18:29.612 --> 18:30.727
Yeah.

18:54.554 --> 18:58.103
Come back here and put your clothes on!

18:58.350 --> 19:00.989
I don't want to wear my old britches.

19:02.562 --> 19:06.953
It ain't proper to be
running around naked all the time.

20:38.660 --> 20:40.139
Alone at last.

20:44.876 --> 20:48.664
Richard, Emmeline,
I want you both to promise me something.

20:49.756 --> 20:52.828
I want you to promise me
that you will never, ever go over...

20:53.050 --> 20:55.120
to the other side of the island.

20:55.303 --> 20:56.656
Why, Paddy?

20:58.014 --> 21:00.733
Why? Because I tell you, that's why!

21:01.225 --> 21:03.739
There's nasty things go on over there, see?

21:04.145 --> 21:06.215
Vile, evil, sinister things.

21:06.773 --> 21:08.092
Like what?

21:08.233 --> 21:10.110
Yes, Mr. Button, like what?

21:10.277 --> 21:13.235
Well, for a start,
that's where the bogeyman lives.

21:13.446 --> 21:14.799
The bogeyman?

21:14.948 --> 21:17.985
That's right. And you know what happens
when the bogeyman...

21:18.202 --> 21:21.080
gets his hands on little people
like yourselves?

21:22.081 --> 21:23.594
Why, he just eats them.

21:23.831 --> 21:25.901
He pops them into his mouth like candy...

21:26.085 --> 21:29.714
and he chews them up
and he swallows them, bones and all.

21:34.801 --> 21:36.712
Do you know what "law" is?

21:38.138 --> 21:41.255
Good. From now on, that's the law, see?

21:41.934 --> 21:45.085
No one goes over to the other side.

21:50.568 --> 21:51.921
You look funny.

21:52.653 --> 21:55.486
Children, where are you?

21:57.951 --> 21:59.304
Look at me.

22:01.454 --> 22:02.807
Look at me.

22:29.733 --> 22:32.452
You're silly
when you drink out of that barrel.

22:33.153 --> 22:34.825
This is a serious dance.

22:35.030 --> 22:37.339
Sing the one
about the Hoochie Coochie girls.

22:37.533 --> 22:39.603
Come on. Are you ready?

24:06.791 --> 24:08.270
Where's Paddy?

24:23.933 --> 24:25.252
He's gone.

24:26.853 --> 24:28.252
There he is.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.950
He must have swum over there
and gone to sleep. Come on.

24:40.993 --> 24:42.870
What are you doing that for?

24:43.245 --> 24:47.397
I'm going to put it on Mr. Button's head,
so when you say "boo" into his ear...

24:47.916 --> 24:50.066
he'll jump up with it on.

25:15.152 --> 25:17.108
Paddy, wake up, it's us.

25:19.824 --> 25:21.860
Wake up!

26:04.454 --> 26:06.968
Don't worry, Em, we'll be all right.

26:07.956 --> 26:10.595
Take me away from this place, Richard.

26:51.918 --> 26:53.067
Look!

27:03.055 --> 27:06.491
This looks like a good place
to stay for awhile.

30:27.181 --> 30:29.615
Wake up. It's Christmas morning.

30:30.018 --> 30:31.053
Christmas?

30:31.185 --> 30:34.461
Yesterday, I counted 52 big marks
on the tree and last night he came.

30:34.688 --> 30:36.087
What are you talking about?

30:36.231 --> 30:40.110
Santa Claus. I saw all his reindeer
right there on the beach.

30:40.361 --> 30:42.272
Let's see if he brought us anything.

30:42.447 --> 30:43.721
Come on, Em, hurry.

30:49.245 --> 30:51.759
That's where the reindeer were, see?

30:53.458 --> 30:55.255
Look at our stockings.

30:55.460 --> 30:57.291
And there's something in them!

31:12.352 --> 31:14.229
Look, just what I always wanted.

31:14.438 --> 31:15.666
What are they?

31:15.856 --> 31:17.926
What do they look like? They're marbles.

31:18.108 --> 31:21.100
See, these are your Jaspers
and these are your Peewees.

31:24.782 --> 31:26.295
You did it all.

31:26.783 --> 31:27.579
But...

31:33.875 --> 31:35.627
Fooled ya, didn't I?

31:38.754 --> 31:39.823
You!

31:50.057 --> 31:51.615
Why are we always fighting so much?

31:53.686 --> 31:54.880
I don't know.

31:55.689 --> 31:58.965
That should be our New Year's revolution:
To stop fighting so much.

32:00.068 --> 32:02.263
- I'll try, but...
- But, what?

32:03.906 --> 32:07.216
I don't know what's wrong with me
when I say the things I say.

32:07.909 --> 32:10.298
I just keep on having
all these strange thoughts.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.172
What kind of thoughts?

32:13.665 --> 32:16.418
Just thoughts.
Funny thoughts about you and me.

32:19.213 --> 32:20.328
Tell me.

32:20.464 --> 32:21.817
I couldn't.

32:22.216 --> 32:25.094
They're just thoughts.
They don't mean anything.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.657
Where did you find these?

32:27.846 --> 32:29.882
I found them in those little shells.

32:31.266 --> 32:32.984
They're beautiful. Thank you.

32:45.323 --> 32:48.315
"O come, all ye faithful"

32:51.621 --> 32:55.170
"O little town of Bethlehem"

32:58.587 --> 33:02.102
"Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh"

33:02.507 --> 33:03.906
"All the"

34:08.783 --> 34:09.772
Help!

34:21.337 --> 34:22.326
What's wrong?

34:26.177 --> 34:27.246
You're bleeding.

34:29.179 --> 34:30.498
Don't! I'm all right.

34:30.804 --> 34:31.998
But you're bleeding.

34:32.431 --> 34:34.070
Go away! Don't look at me.

34:37.272 --> 34:38.500
Go away!

35:06.926 --> 35:08.439
What was it, Em?

35:08.803 --> 35:11.636
- Why were you bleeding like that?
- I don't know.

35:11.932 --> 35:13.047
Liar!

35:13.309 --> 35:15.265
It's true, I don't know.

35:19.273 --> 35:22.663
People don't bleed like that
unless they've cut themselves.

35:23.444 --> 35:26.163
Maybe you're hurt real bad
and you just don't know it.

35:26.447 --> 35:28.836
- Let me look.
- No! I don't want you to look.

35:29.158 --> 35:31.547
- But, why?
- Just because.

35:32.285 --> 35:33.843
That is not fair.

35:34.079 --> 35:37.276
I don't keep any secrets from you.
I tell you everything.

35:37.792 --> 35:39.145
Everything.

36:24.130 --> 36:25.882
What are you looking at?

36:26.049 --> 36:27.004
Your muscles.

36:27.592 --> 36:28.786
What about them?

36:31.012 --> 36:34.368
You're really acting silly lately.
Always saying dumb things like that.

36:34.642 --> 36:36.234
Always looking at me funny.

36:36.726 --> 36:39.115
You're not coming down with something,
are you?

36:41.148 --> 36:42.866
Well, don't give it to me.

38:02.232 --> 38:03.221
Tell me again.

38:03.608 --> 38:06.281
- Where are your mother and father?
- In heaven.

38:06.777 --> 38:08.369
But where's heaven?

38:08.989 --> 38:10.547
You know, up there.

38:11.282 --> 38:14.399
- Your father might be there, too.
- No, he's not.

38:14.869 --> 38:17.337
He's coming on a ship someday
to take us home.

38:22.001 --> 38:23.354
Do you hear it?

38:24.004 --> 38:25.039
No.

38:25.255 --> 38:26.927
Do you ever hear it?

38:27.090 --> 38:29.001
Sometimes I think I do.

38:29.592 --> 38:31.184
I think Paddy was a liar.

38:31.845 --> 38:35.121
He told us there was a pot of gold
at the end of every rainbow...

38:35.390 --> 38:36.948
and that was a lie.

38:37.435 --> 38:40.347
He told us if we dug far enough
we'd reach China.

38:40.896 --> 38:42.966
And Santa Claus never came.

38:49.322 --> 38:51.916
Do you ever think about him?

38:55.035 --> 38:56.150
I do.

38:58.830 --> 39:01.298
I know you don't like to
talk about it, but...

39:02.043 --> 39:05.080
don't you ever wonder
what really happened?

39:07.924 --> 39:10.154
I don't want to know what happened.

39:13.263 --> 39:14.252
I do.

39:15.723 --> 39:18.237
There are so many things
I don't understand.

39:18.435 --> 39:22.872
Why do fish stop swimming and lie on top
of the tide pools after it rains?

39:24.482 --> 39:26.916
Why do you hear the waves
inside the big shells?

39:27.152 --> 39:29.586
Why are all these funny hairs
growing on me?

39:33.658 --> 39:37.014
I wish a big book with all the answers
to every question in the world...

39:37.246 --> 39:40.204
would drop out of the sky
and land in my hand right now.

39:40.415 --> 39:44.090
- I'd read it till I knew everything.
- You can't know everything.

39:45.379 --> 39:47.210
Only God knows everything.

39:47.631 --> 39:48.700
God?

39:48.924 --> 39:51.722
He can't find us
any better than Santa Claus.

40:24.543 --> 40:26.534
I wonder what fish think about?

40:31.760 --> 40:33.239
What are you doing?

40:33.470 --> 40:36.303
Trying to cheer you up. Come on, laugh.

40:38.224 --> 40:39.816
It's not going to work.

40:41.602 --> 40:43.274
There it is again.

40:46.734 --> 40:48.770
Do you think it's the bogeyman?

40:50.820 --> 40:52.697
Maybe it's another person.

40:56.201 --> 40:56.951
No...

40:57.411 --> 41:00.369
or he would have come over
to meet us and say hello.

41:00.914 --> 41:02.552
That's the proper thing to do.

41:02.708 --> 41:05.541
What if he's not nice?
What if he wants to hurt us?

41:08.006 --> 41:09.405
Then I'll spear him.

41:31.488 --> 41:34.127
Look! I'm the greatest fisherman
who ever lived.

41:34.949 --> 41:37.019
I'm the greatest fisherman who ever lived.

41:37.202 --> 41:40.000
While you scare them off,
I catch as many as I want to.

41:40.329 --> 41:42.684
That's my fish dance!
It doesn't scare them off.

41:42.873 --> 41:45.785
It brings them up to the surface
where I can spear them.

41:46.002 --> 41:47.515
Who cares what you say?

41:47.670 --> 41:50.389
It's not how many you catch.
It's how you do it.

42:08.275 --> 42:09.594
Stop that!

42:11.319 --> 42:13.549
Please play something else.

42:14.698 --> 42:17.770
Why must you do that
when you know it makes me angry?

42:33.092 --> 42:35.652
"It doesn't scare them away.
It brings 'em to the top..."

42:35.845 --> 42:37.437
"...where I can spear them."

42:38.097 --> 42:39.246
I'll spear you.

42:57.826 --> 42:59.145
Here I am.

42:59.745 --> 43:00.973
Come back here...

43:01.205 --> 43:04.163
or I'll pull your britches down
and take a switch to you.

43:05.667 --> 43:08.056
Don't you dare try to spank me. I mean it.

43:08.253 --> 43:11.051
I'll put never-wake-up berries
in your food! I mean it.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.611
Say, "Richard is the smartest person
on the island."

43:14.218 --> 43:17.130
- Say it!
- Stop it, Richard. I'm getting angry.

43:17.556 --> 43:19.433
- Stop it! Now get off.
- Say it!

43:20.223 --> 43:22.532
Richard is the smartest person
on the island.

43:22.727 --> 43:24.877
- The fastest swimmer.
- The fastest swimmer.

43:25.063 --> 43:27.133
- The fastest runner.
- The fastest runner.

43:27.314 --> 43:30.351
- The best hut builder.
- You're the best everything. Now get off!

43:30.819 --> 43:31.854
It's true.

43:33.154 --> 43:35.622
Just you wait.
You'll never know when it'll happen.

43:35.824 --> 43:38.418
Just one little bite
and you'll never wake up again.

48:11.356 --> 48:13.267
- What is it? What happened?
- I saw him.

48:13.442 --> 48:15.876
- Who?
- The face Paddy thought was a bogeyman.

48:16.194 --> 48:18.754
- You went to the other side?
- He's not the bogeyman.

48:18.947 --> 48:20.585
I think he's God.

48:20.824 --> 48:21.415
God?

48:21.533 --> 48:23.763
He looks like Pastor Logan said
he looked like:

48:23.952 --> 48:26.750
"You'd better be good or else."
And he was bleeding.

48:27.038 --> 48:28.915
- I don't believe you.
- Just like Jesus.

48:29.083 --> 48:31.039
Don't go there again. It's the law.

48:31.209 --> 48:33.564
What if he really is God?
Shouldn't we go and pray?

48:33.753 --> 48:36.313
Or won't he be mad
and not let us go to heaven?

48:36.506 --> 48:38.462
I don't want to talk about it.

49:57.923 --> 49:59.242
What is it?

50:00.425 --> 50:01.221
I'm here.

50:06.265 --> 50:09.257
- You ate the "dead and berries"...
- No, I'm fine.

50:09.478 --> 50:12.231
- You just had a bad dream.
- Don't ever leave me.

50:12.938 --> 50:15.498
Promise you won't.
Promise you'll always be with me.

50:15.984 --> 50:16.894
I promise.

50:29.206 --> 50:30.480
Don't.

51:32.229 --> 51:33.947
What are you doing?

51:35.482 --> 51:36.710
Go away!

52:01.801 --> 52:03.393
Where are you going?

52:10.059 --> 52:12.050
Wait. What's the matter?

52:31.373 --> 52:33.648
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?

52:34.835 --> 52:36.393
Why won't you talk to me?

52:36.836 --> 52:39.225
Just leave me alone.

54:02.424 --> 54:04.142
A ship, Emmeline!

54:07.013 --> 54:11.211
The signal fire, you didn't light it.
Why didn't you light it?

54:11.475 --> 54:15.468
You know how much I want to leave.
It's the most important thing to me.

54:15.771 --> 54:16.965
I know.

54:17.940 --> 54:20.408
First you cry for help,
then you throw sticks at me.

54:20.610 --> 54:21.884
A ship comes, a ship!

54:22.111 --> 54:26.548
The first ship we've seen
since we've been here and you let it go by.

54:26.866 --> 54:29.096
Well, that's it. I've had it.

54:29.285 --> 54:31.719
I'm sick and tired
of waiting for you to get better.

54:31.954 --> 54:34.070
I'm going to San Fr'isco without you.

55:33.560 --> 55:36.791
You'll never build a boat strong enough
to get to San Fr'isco.

55:37.063 --> 55:39.941
That's the fourth time you've tried
and they've all sunk.

55:40.150 --> 55:41.060
Shut up!

55:41.192 --> 55:42.511
Why don't you give up?

55:42.652 --> 55:45.212
You don't even know where San Fr'isco is.

55:47.991 --> 55:50.983
You're such a silly dodo.
We're never getting off this island.

55:51.203 --> 55:52.636
Thanks to you.

55:52.871 --> 55:55.749
This is where we live.
This is our home, now and forever.

55:55.957 --> 55:56.992
No!

55:57.167 --> 55:59.397
I could never live here forever
with just you.

55:59.628 --> 56:02.188
I don't even like you.
You never used to laugh at me.

56:02.381 --> 56:04.053
You never used to have secrets.

56:04.216 --> 56:06.889
You're not so perfect either,
Mr. Richard Lestrange.

56:07.094 --> 56:08.686
I've seen you playing with it.

56:08.845 --> 56:11.234
And I'll tell your father
if he ever gets here.

56:11.431 --> 56:13.069
You. I hate you.

56:15.144 --> 56:16.463
You almost hit me.

56:16.603 --> 56:19.356
- Take back what you said.
- I've seen it all.

56:19.565 --> 56:21.521
What happens after you do it a long time.

56:21.693 --> 56:23.649
Shut up! That isn't fair, peeking.

56:23.819 --> 56:25.377
- I don't peek on you.
- That's a lie.

56:25.530 --> 56:27.361
You're always staring at my buppies.

56:27.532 --> 56:30.569
Only because they look so funny.
You know what you look like now?

56:30.785 --> 56:32.901
You look like
one of those pictures Paddy had.

56:33.079 --> 56:34.797
One of his Hoochie Coochie girls.

56:34.956 --> 56:35.991
I do not!

56:39.044 --> 56:41.512
Stop that, or I'll never talk to you again.

56:43.173 --> 56:45.164
See them jiggle, wiggle and shake.

56:47.677 --> 56:50.475
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.

56:52.391 --> 56:54.621
I wish you were dead and buried.

57:02.902 --> 57:04.335
What are you doing?

57:10.493 --> 57:12.404
It's my hut. I built it.

57:12.578 --> 57:14.614
That's not true. I helped you.

57:14.789 --> 57:17.542
I did most of it.
You can find some other place to live.

57:17.750 --> 57:21.220
I said I was sorry, Richard.
What more do you want me to say?

57:21.462 --> 57:23.851
I don't want you to say anything.

57:26.801 --> 57:29.269
I don't ever want to see you again.

57:30.471 --> 57:33.747
You just wait, Richard Lestrange.
I'll get you for this!

58:42.336 --> 58:44.167
What's wrong with you?

58:45.840 --> 58:47.068
Go away.

58:52.639 --> 58:54.311
What happened?

58:55.016 --> 58:58.531
I stepped on one of those fish
that looks like a rock.

59:05.193 --> 59:06.592
Don't go to sleep.

59:09.280 --> 59:10.918
Oh, no. Please wake up.

59:12.284 --> 59:13.353
God.

59:16.205 --> 59:17.718
Take me to God.

59:18.832 --> 59:20.231
But the law...

01:00:24.233 --> 01:00:25.302
God...

01:00:26.819 --> 01:00:29.287
please don't make Em never wake up.

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:33.045
I didn't mean it when I said
I wanted her dead and buried.

01:00:35.578 --> 01:00:38.217
I forgot most of my prayers, God...

01:00:40.583 --> 01:00:41.572
But...

01:00:46.046 --> 01:00:47.638
Our Father...

01:00:50.259 --> 01:00:51.897
who art in heaven...

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.539
kingdom come...

01:01:08.736 --> 01:01:10.886
with liberty and justice for all.

01:01:11.323 --> 01:01:12.312
Amen.

01:01:38.267 --> 01:01:39.939
Em, are you all right?

01:01:42.354 --> 01:01:43.992
I've been so worried.

01:01:46.859 --> 01:01:49.293
You mean, you're not mad at me anymore?

01:01:49.612 --> 01:01:51.091
Of course not.

01:01:53.449 --> 01:01:55.041
I was so scared.

01:02:00.499 --> 01:02:02.251
All I could think of was:

01:02:05.044 --> 01:02:06.762
What if I lost my Em?

01:02:10.925 --> 01:02:12.517
What would I do?

01:02:47.504 --> 01:02:50.814
Here's some food
to help you get your strength back.

01:02:55.055 --> 01:02:57.444
Do you see that island out there?

01:02:58.307 --> 01:02:59.376
Yes.

01:03:00.227 --> 01:03:03.299
I've been thinking, maybe the person
who makes the drum noise...

01:03:03.521 --> 01:03:06.274
lives there and then comes here to pray.

01:03:07.776 --> 01:03:08.925
Maybe.

01:03:10.278 --> 01:03:12.508
Would you like to try to walk?

01:03:27.921 --> 01:03:29.115
You all right?

01:03:29.674 --> 01:03:30.743
Yes.

01:05:15.739 --> 01:05:16.967
Kiss me.

01:05:17.533 --> 01:05:19.205
You're all sticky.

01:05:19.535 --> 01:05:21.412
So what? Kiss me.

01:05:26.334 --> 01:05:28.052
Stop it, I can't breath.

01:05:28.252 --> 01:05:30.243
But I don't want to stop.

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:34.518
What are you doing?

01:05:42.476 --> 01:05:43.704
Stop it.

01:06:01.328 --> 01:06:03.558
I feel so funny in my stomach.

01:06:07.502 --> 01:06:08.730
Me, too.

01:06:14.134 --> 01:06:16.204
My heart is beating so fast.

01:06:19.097 --> 01:06:20.416
Mine, too.

01:12:43.324 --> 01:12:45.792
Will you stop eating? You're getting fat.

01:12:49.831 --> 01:12:51.981
Come on up, keep me warm?

01:13:13.772 --> 01:13:15.410
Where's Em, Coco?

01:13:53.938 --> 01:13:55.656
I'm sorry, Richard.

01:13:55.857 --> 01:13:58.325
You didn't want it all
day yesterday either.

01:13:58.525 --> 01:14:01.085
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?

01:14:01.279 --> 01:14:04.032
Yes, I love you more than ever, Richard.

01:14:04.532 --> 01:14:06.602
Then why don't you want to do it?

01:14:07.411 --> 01:14:09.925
It just hurts right now, that's all.

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:13.442
When it stops hurting, we'll do it.

01:14:13.625 --> 01:14:15.456
When is that going to be?

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:21.303
I don't understand. Why does it hurt?

01:14:22.259 --> 01:14:23.692
I don't know.

01:14:24.177 --> 01:14:26.008
I don't know anything.

01:14:29.683 --> 01:14:32.641
But if you touch my tummy right now,
you can feel it.

01:14:35.273 --> 01:14:36.422
Feel what?

01:14:41.946 --> 01:14:44.255
How did you make
your tummy move like that?

01:14:44.449 --> 01:14:46.087
I'm not doing it.

01:14:47.118 --> 01:14:49.268
It's not doing it by itself.

01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:51.223
Yes, it is.

01:14:53.123 --> 01:14:55.079
There. I felt it again.

01:14:55.751 --> 01:14:57.742
What's making it do that?

01:14:59.088 --> 01:15:00.521
I don't know.

01:15:35.501 --> 01:15:36.980
Where are you?

01:17:44.425 --> 01:17:46.177
Where are you?

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:05.849
What's wrong? Did they hurt you?

01:18:06.572 --> 01:18:07.687
They?

01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:25.270
What is it? Tell me what to do.

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:26.820
What is it?

01:18:28.136 --> 01:18:29.455
Answer me.

01:19:35.038 --> 01:19:36.676
Why did you have a baby?

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:38.973
I don't know.

01:19:43.714 --> 01:19:45.113
Hello, baby.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.596
Look, I think he's hungry.

01:19:58.896 --> 01:20:00.693
What do you feed him?

01:20:00.981 --> 01:20:02.539
Try some fruit.

01:20:04.109 --> 01:20:05.508
Here you go.

01:20:08.239 --> 01:20:09.831
Good food. Fruit.

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.292
It doesn't like it.

01:20:12.827 --> 01:20:14.624
Here, let me try this.

01:20:24.172 --> 01:20:25.605
What do I do?

01:21:07.049 --> 01:21:08.607
Why are you doing that?

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.159
The drum people.

01:21:10.387 --> 01:21:11.502
What?

01:21:13.222 --> 01:21:14.291
I saw them.

01:21:14.765 --> 01:21:15.834
When?

01:21:15.974 --> 01:21:17.646
The night he came.

01:21:18.728 --> 01:21:20.320
What did they look like?

01:21:20.604 --> 01:21:23.072
I don't want to talk about it.
Paddy was right.

01:21:23.274 --> 01:21:25.151
We shouldn't have gone to the other side.

01:21:25.318 --> 01:21:27.354
We should have never broken the law.

01:21:27.528 --> 01:21:29.917
- Do they know we're here?
- I don't think so.

01:21:30.114 --> 01:21:32.469
If they come,
I'll do to them what I do to the fish.

01:21:32.659 --> 01:21:34.297
I'll stick it through their eyes!

01:21:34.453 --> 01:21:38.571
I'll stick it through their bellies
and watch their guts come out!

01:22:05.442 --> 01:22:08.912
Remember on the ship
when we tried to get to the dinghy...

01:22:09.529 --> 01:22:12.282
how the men
pushed and shoved each other?

01:22:13.993 --> 01:22:15.824
How their eyes looked?

01:22:17.079 --> 01:22:19.673
It was the same with the drum people.

01:22:23.127 --> 01:22:27.723
I don't understand. Why do people
have to be so bad to each other?

01:25:49.172 --> 01:25:50.605
Come here, hurry.

01:25:51.132 --> 01:25:52.770
I'm busy keeping watch.

01:25:53.051 --> 01:25:55.201
Come on, you have to see this.

01:26:20.496 --> 01:26:22.407
You taught him to swim.

01:27:25.188 --> 01:27:27.258
Water.

01:27:31.193 --> 01:27:32.672
Look at the fishies.

01:27:34.363 --> 01:27:36.240
Around the tree and back down the hole.

01:27:41.162 --> 01:27:42.595
Get the boat.

01:28:33.924 --> 01:28:37.041
Look at the bird. Look, Paddy.

01:28:43.809 --> 01:28:46.164
Do you see some fishies?
What do you see?

01:28:46.771 --> 01:28:48.443
Tell me, do you see a ship?

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.593
Paddy, fan.

01:29:02.995 --> 01:29:04.223
Richard.

01:29:05.332 --> 01:29:06.845
He said my name.

01:29:13.298 --> 01:29:15.892
Look, Paddy, we're making footprints.

01:29:16.259 --> 01:29:18.011
Like Boston in the winter.

01:29:18.178 --> 01:29:21.773
Remember the snowball fights we had
every time it snowed?

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.232
See, it's freezing.

01:29:29.273 --> 01:29:30.592
It's cold.

01:29:36.447 --> 01:29:38.517
The bogeyman.

01:29:53.131 --> 01:29:56.601
You better bring him up to see
or he'll hear about it from the crew...

01:29:56.842 --> 01:29:59.436
and we'll have to sail back tomorrow.

01:30:00.429 --> 01:30:01.657
Excuse me, sir.

01:30:01.847 --> 01:30:03.644
We sighted something.

01:30:09.397 --> 01:30:10.625
There.

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.992
What do you think?

01:30:14.194 --> 01:30:15.832
Can we go closer?

01:30:16.822 --> 01:30:19.973
I'll see,
but we have to be careful of that reef.

01:30:29.084 --> 01:30:30.483
Look at that face.

01:30:33.297 --> 01:30:34.412
Boat.

01:31:12.171 --> 01:31:14.207
No, that couldn't be them.

01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.015
Do you know how to get to
the place where we lived with Paddy?

01:31:53.254 --> 01:31:55.643
Sure. I go there for bananas.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.273
Take me there?

01:31:57.925 --> 01:31:59.517
I thought you were afraid.

01:31:59.677 --> 01:32:01.588
I want to see it again.

01:32:04.432 --> 01:32:05.751
In you go.

01:32:42.471 --> 01:32:43.824
You coming?

01:35:31.561 --> 01:35:32.710
Shark!

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.638
I have to get the oars.

01:36:00.382 --> 01:36:02.293
Help me, Em, we're drifting.

01:36:06.931 --> 01:36:08.364
Go away.

01:36:17.150 --> 01:36:19.186
Look how far out we are!

01:36:37.837 --> 01:36:39.509
I can't stop this.

01:37:21.423 --> 01:37:22.651
Paddy, look.

01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:25.366
When it hits the water,
you can hear it hiss.

01:37:25.554 --> 01:37:26.873
Look, see?

01:37:27.013 --> 01:37:28.241
Hear it?

01:37:42.946 --> 01:37:43.822
I'm thirsty.

01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:46.294
I wish we had some water.

01:38:05.093 --> 01:38:06.287
Fishies.

01:38:10.057 --> 01:38:12.173
No, Paddy!

01:38:12.643 --> 01:38:15.362
- Where did you get those?
- Get those out of your mouth.

01:38:15.562 --> 01:38:19.680
What are you doing?
Get those out of your mouth.

01:38:26.574 --> 01:38:28.246
He swallowed some.

01:38:44.259 --> 01:38:45.578
Come here.

01:38:56.562 --> 01:38:58.314
Don't close your eyes, Paddy.

01:38:58.482 --> 01:39:00.473
Please don't go to sleep.

01:39:11.036 --> 01:39:12.025
Please.

01:40:53.475 --> 01:40:57.434
Three points to port, sir.
Looks to be a small craft.

01:40:58.104 --> 01:40:59.457
See anyone in it?

01:40:59.898 --> 01:41:01.650
I can't make it out.

01:41:04.152 --> 01:41:07.064
Captain, three points to port.

01:42:14.349 --> 01:42:15.828
Are they dead?

01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:20.431
No, sir. They're asleep.
