WEBVTT

00:20.709 --> 00:23.042
(soft, dramatic music)

01:04.375 --> 01:07.167
- Hey! I'm not gonna kill you!

01:08.125 --> 01:10.083
I'm just here for information.

01:10.125 --> 01:11.584
- Don't do it.

01:11.626 --> 01:13.334
Don't...

01:11.626 --> 01:13.334
(exclaiming)

01:14.667 --> 01:17.000
- You're gonna tell me

01:14.667 --> 01:17.000
everything you know about Lord

01:14.667 --> 01:17.000
Benton,

01:17.042 --> 01:18.500
where he's going,

01:17.042 --> 01:18.500
how many men he's with.

01:18.542 --> 01:19.959
I want to know everything.

01:21.876 --> 01:24.876
(McTaggart): Ha-ha!

01:21.876 --> 01:24.876
Look at that silly fucker go.

01:24.918 --> 01:28.209
You havin' a laugh, Harp!

01:24.918 --> 01:28.209
You'll never pop him from there.

01:31.083 --> 01:32.042
(exclaiming)

01:35.417 --> 01:37.709
- You were saying?

01:35.417 --> 01:37.709
(soldier groaning)

01:40.542 --> 01:41.959
(groaning)

01:43.500 --> 01:45.209
That's not possible.

01:45.250 --> 01:48.584
- And yet, there he goes.

01:45.250 --> 01:48.584
At top speed, no less.

01:45.250 --> 01:48.584
- Let's go.

01:48.626 --> 01:50.876
We need to stop him

01:48.626 --> 01:50.876
before he gets to Moose Fort.

01:50.918 --> 01:54.125
- Nah, no way, no way.

01:50.918 --> 01:54.125
I gotta get back to the outpost.

01:55.292 --> 01:57.375
- For what?

01:55.292 --> 01:57.375
- Supplies.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.459
- What supplies?

01:57.417 --> 01:59.459
We're gonna use these guns,

01:59.500 --> 02:01.459
and we'll make due

01:59.500 --> 02:01.459
when we get to the fort.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.542
- No way. I'll tell ya what.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.542
I'll meet you up. How's that?

02:05.209 --> 02:07.792
- Goddammit, McTaggart.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.792
I need you.

02:08.751 --> 02:11.709
Charlie, don't waste any time.

02:08.751 --> 02:11.709
In and out.

02:28.209 --> 02:31.292
(theme music)

03:28.250 --> 03:30.834
(wind whistling forcefully)

05:06.042 --> 05:09.125
- It's colder than a

05:06.042 --> 05:09.125
witch's quim-whisker out there.

05:06.042 --> 05:09.125
- Yeah...

05:09.709 --> 05:11.667
Where's the powder and shot?

05:11.709 --> 05:13.626
- Trap door to the larder's

05:11.709 --> 05:13.626
behind the bar,

05:13.667 --> 05:15.792
straight in, boom.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.792
Then we're the fuck outta here.

05:15.834 --> 05:19.876
- Hey, McTaggart, do you

05:15.834 --> 05:19.876
really feel like this

05:15.834 --> 05:19.876
is necessary?

05:19.918 --> 05:22.167
I mean, you walked us

05:19.918 --> 05:22.167
into the lion's den.

05:22.918 --> 05:26.250
I reckon your plan

05:22.918 --> 05:26.250
could use a little more time

05:22.918 --> 05:26.250
in the cookery.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.876
You know what I mean?

05:26.292 --> 05:27.876
- No, Charlie,

05:27.918 --> 05:30.000
I don't know what you mean.

05:27.918 --> 05:30.000
Now, I'm hungry.

05:30.042 --> 05:34.500
Hello, chief.

05:30.042 --> 05:34.500
What would you recommend

05:30.042 --> 05:34.500
for two thirsty travelers?

05:34.542 --> 05:37.709
And preferably something

05:34.542 --> 05:37.709
that don't taste

05:34.542 --> 05:37.709
like donkey piss.

05:37.751 --> 05:39.918
- What'd you say?

05:37.751 --> 05:39.918
- Ah, my friend here,

05:39.959 --> 05:41.709
he was raised by wolves.

05:41.751 --> 05:44.918
He's got a...

05:41.751 --> 05:44.918
crooked sense of humour.

05:41.751 --> 05:44.918
(chuckling)

05:44.959 --> 05:46.500
- You know what?

05:46.542 --> 05:50.292
This place was once cared for,

05:46.542 --> 05:50.292
you know? Looked after.

05:50.334 --> 05:54.500
Why don't you take

05:50.334 --> 05:54.500
a fucking cloth to it,

05:50.334 --> 05:54.500
sweep up from time to time?

05:54.542 --> 05:58.500
Hire a barkeep that's not

05:54.542 --> 05:58.500
half as daft as you look.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.918
(Charlie): He's a special one.

06:00.959 --> 06:03.918
We've been walking outside

06:00.959 --> 06:03.918
for... days.

06:03.959 --> 06:05.918
Yeah, we just really would like

06:03.959 --> 06:05.918
something to drink,

06:05.959 --> 06:08.167
and we have coin.

06:10.959 --> 06:12.292
(coin tinkling)

06:19.584 --> 06:22.542
Keep it together. Remember,

06:19.584 --> 06:22.542
Harp said "in and out."

06:22.584 --> 06:26.167
Keep your mind on the target.

06:22.584 --> 06:26.167
You could get us both killed!

06:26.209 --> 06:28.834
- Alright, alright, alright.

06:26.209 --> 06:28.834
Alright.

06:30.292 --> 06:31.626
Fuck this.

06:33.209 --> 06:34.834
Alright, here we go.

06:34.876 --> 06:37.250
Yeah. Yes.

06:37.584 --> 06:40.250
- You and your slave

06:37.584 --> 06:40.250
best be moving on.

06:40.292 --> 06:42.542
- What's that?

06:40.292 --> 06:42.542
Hey, don't be rude.

06:42.584 --> 06:45.167
He's not my slave,

06:42.584 --> 06:45.167
he's my accountant.

06:45.209 --> 06:47.542
- Would a slave

06:45.209 --> 06:47.542
have teeth like this?

06:47.584 --> 06:49.042
- What's this?

06:51.209 --> 06:52.417
What's all this?

06:52.459 --> 06:54.959
- Ah, that would be mine,

06:52.459 --> 06:54.959
you wee wetback.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.459
You see,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.459
this is my establishment.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.792
These are all my belongings.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.792
There ya go, nice and cozy.

07:02.626 --> 07:05.876
Now, if you're not mad keen

07:02.626 --> 07:05.876
on being brutally murdered,

07:05.918 --> 07:07.959
you'll give me

07:05.918 --> 07:07.959
that fucking bottle.

07:10.083 --> 07:12.083
No? Alright.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.751
- Hey!

07:13.500 --> 07:14.751
(groaning)

07:17.375 --> 07:21.042
- Stab! Stab! Stab! Stab!!!

07:21.083 --> 07:22.792
(all exclaiming)

07:22.834 --> 07:25.584
- Whoo!

07:22.834 --> 07:25.584
- Aaargh!

07:26.959 --> 07:28.375
(McTaggart sighing

07:26.959 --> 07:28.375
contentedly)

07:28.417 --> 07:29.626
Ooh.

07:28.417 --> 07:29.626
- Hey!

07:29.667 --> 07:30.709
(Charlie roaring)

07:33.250 --> 07:35.667
- Yeah! Ooh!

07:33.250 --> 07:35.667
(Charlie chuckling)

07:35.959 --> 07:38.209
(door opening, gun cocking)

07:38.250 --> 07:39.667
(exclamation)

07:41.292 --> 07:42.334
- Schooh!

07:43.792 --> 07:45.417
- Well, that works.

07:45.459 --> 07:47.834
- Now, that there

07:45.459 --> 07:47.834
was a decent shot.

07:48.459 --> 07:52.083
- Well done, Charles the Bold.

07:48.459 --> 07:52.083
Right over here. Ah...

07:52.125 --> 07:53.626
Aye.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.626
- Hey. Yeah!

07:53.667 --> 07:55.417
- Here you go, butterfingers.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.417
- Ah!

07:55.459 --> 07:56.834
- Catch.

07:55.459 --> 07:56.834
- Yes!

07:56.876 --> 07:59.042
- Right, go get the guns,

07:56.876 --> 07:59.042
Charlie.

07:59.876 --> 08:02.417
I'll get the whiskey.

07:59.876 --> 08:02.417
Ah!

08:02.959 --> 08:05.125
Ah, shhh...

08:06.459 --> 08:08.125
Papa's got you now.

08:15.292 --> 08:17.125
- Chaulk. Wait.

08:17.792 --> 08:18.834
Listen.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.167
They're not coming.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.792
We'd hear the dogs,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.792
or... or voices at least.

08:26.584 --> 08:30.042
- No, I don't trust it.

08:26.584 --> 08:30.042
He's not gonna let us get away.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.542
- Well, we got a head start.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.542
We should keep moving.

08:35.125 --> 08:36.834
- What...

08:35.125 --> 08:36.834
what are you looking for?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.626
- Landmarks.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.626
So we don't get lost.

08:59.876 --> 09:03.292
- We have to find Miss Emberly

08:59.876 --> 09:03.292
before he does.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.334
You've disappointed me, Wadlow.

09:05.959 --> 09:08.083
If a couple of silly girls

09:05.959 --> 09:08.083
can elude you,

09:08.125 --> 09:10.000
what chance do you have

09:08.125 --> 09:10.000
of capturing Harp?

09:10.042 --> 09:12.209
- They are silly girls,

09:10.042 --> 09:12.209
but it's a little bit

09:12.250 --> 09:14.918
like trying to find a black cat

09:12.250 --> 09:14.918
in a coal cellar.

09:14.959 --> 09:16.459
Whereas, with Harp,

09:16.500 --> 09:19.209
he'll be walking straight

09:16.500 --> 09:19.209
into our trap.

09:20.542 --> 09:21.876
We will not fail.

09:21.918 --> 09:24.584
- Unless she finds him

09:21.918 --> 09:24.584
out in those woods.

09:25.125 --> 09:28.459
I don't care

09:25.125 --> 09:28.459
if she's a black cat

09:25.125 --> 09:28.459
in a coal cellar,

09:28.500 --> 09:30.417
a white cat in a snowstorm,

09:30.459 --> 09:33.125
or a green cat

09:30.459 --> 09:33.125
in a field of grass.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.918
You find her

09:33.167 --> 09:35.918
and bring her to me.

10:00.334 --> 10:01.709
- Douglas Brown?

10:05.709 --> 10:06.959
- Who are you?

10:07.417 --> 10:09.918
- I'm Michael Smyth

10:07.417 --> 10:09.918
of the Black Wolf Company.

10:10.334 --> 10:13.459
- Ah, you're Declan Harp's boy.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.375
- I need to speak business

10:14.417 --> 10:16.375
with you.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.375
- Business? With me?

10:19.417 --> 10:21.959
Our business concluded...

10:22.000 --> 10:26.292
when you reneged on that deal,

10:22.000 --> 10:26.292
you and Harp, with my wife.

10:26.334 --> 10:29.334
- Douglas... we delivered.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.626
It was Carruthers

10:29.375 --> 10:31.626
who didn't come to collect.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.292
- She couldn't collect.

10:35.459 --> 10:37.000
- You must understand,

10:35.459 --> 10:37.000
I had no other option

10:37.042 --> 10:38.918
but to sell

10:37.042 --> 10:38.918
to the next buyer in line.

10:38.959 --> 10:42.000
- Who just happened to be

10:38.959 --> 10:42.000
the man who killed her.

10:44.626 --> 10:45.959
- What?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.334
- There's an efficiency

10:46.000 --> 10:49.334
in his evil, Grant.

10:49.375 --> 10:51.167
I'll have to give him that.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.918
- I'm sorry, Douglas.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.918
I really am.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.250
What happened to

10:59.959 --> 11:02.250
Mrs. Carruthers is... is awful.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.792
But I'm not here

11:02.959 --> 11:04.792
to talk about that,

11:04.834 --> 11:07.500
I'm here to talk

11:04.834 --> 11:07.500
about the future,

11:04.834 --> 11:07.500
a better future.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.500
Because none of us

11:07.542 --> 11:09.500
have much of one

11:09.542 --> 11:12.125
as long as we're separately

11:09.542 --> 11:12.125
trying to fend off

11:09.542 --> 11:12.125
the Hudson's Bay Company.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.918
If I can prove

11:12.167 --> 11:13.918
to the Lake Walkers

11:13.959 --> 11:15.876
that I have reliable buyers

11:13.959 --> 11:15.876
here in Montreal,

11:15.918 --> 11:19.000
then we all together

11:15.918 --> 11:19.000
stand a chance

11:15.918 --> 11:19.000
of taking on the company.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.292
(Douglas chuckling)

11:20.500 --> 11:23.292
I could've went to Grant,

11:20.500 --> 11:23.292
Douglas.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.584
But I came to you instead.

11:25.626 --> 11:27.626
- That was a mistake.

11:28.167 --> 11:30.667
- We can't beat the HBC

11:28.167 --> 11:30.667
as fractured independents.

11:30.709 --> 11:34.250
We must form an alliance

11:30.709 --> 11:34.250
to stand up

11:30.709 --> 11:34.250
against their tyranny.

11:34.292 --> 11:38.459
- You sold out

11:34.292 --> 11:38.459
to Samuel Grant and Cobbs Pond.

11:39.667 --> 11:43.334
And for that, I never want

11:39.667 --> 11:43.334
to see your face again.

11:54.292 --> 11:55.542
(Josephette):

11:54.292 --> 11:55.542
What were you thinking?

11:57.918 --> 11:59.751
- I was thinking...

12:00.334 --> 12:01.834
about Elizabeth.

12:03.792 --> 12:06.500
- You have to learn

12:03.792 --> 12:06.500
to separate your emotions

12:03.792 --> 12:06.500
from your business decisions.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.083
(Douglas laughing)

12:09.334 --> 12:13.292
- My instinct is the secret

12:09.334 --> 12:13.292
to my business.

12:13.334 --> 12:16.417
- Oh, really?

12:13.334 --> 12:16.417
How has that fared for you?

12:16.459 --> 12:18.500
- Now, you wait just a minute.

12:18.542 --> 12:22.167
I dinnae bring the storm

12:18.542 --> 12:22.167
that sunk my ship.

12:22.209 --> 12:25.042
I dinnae start the war

12:22.209 --> 12:25.042
with the Lake Walkers.

12:26.459 --> 12:28.751
I dinnae kill my wife.

12:29.542 --> 12:30.751
(chuckling ruefully)

12:31.584 --> 12:33.876
I dinnae... write the will...

12:34.584 --> 12:38.542
...bequeathing all the benefits

12:34.584 --> 12:38.542
of this great company

12:34.584 --> 12:38.542
to a slave.

12:38.584 --> 12:40.417
- I am not a slave!

12:47.834 --> 12:51.292
- Bless me Father,

12:47.834 --> 12:51.292
for I might have sinned,

12:47.834 --> 12:51.292
but I'm not quite sure.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.876
I feel terrible about

12:52.125 --> 12:54.876
some things that have occurred.

12:56.584 --> 12:58.083
I took a man's life.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.876
I thought it was self-defence,

12:58.125 --> 13:00.876
truly I did.

13:01.584 --> 13:04.542
And so I tell myself

13:01.584 --> 13:04.542
I don't need forgiveness

13:01.584 --> 13:04.542
for this.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.209
I am not a bad person.

13:07.334 --> 13:10.125
- If you're not sure

13:07.334 --> 13:10.125
if you've sinned,

13:10.167 --> 13:11.959
why are you speaking to me?

13:12.626 --> 13:15.584
- I want permission

13:12.626 --> 13:15.584
not to feel guilt, Father.

13:17.209 --> 13:19.751
Because I want to survive.

13:20.542 --> 13:22.042
I need to survive.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.834
(Clenna sighing)

13:26.792 --> 13:28.834
(whispering)

13:30.792 --> 13:32.250
(whistling)

13:35.792 --> 13:37.334
- Michael.

13:40.626 --> 13:42.751
- You look

13:40.626 --> 13:42.751
like you're doing well.

13:43.792 --> 13:46.167
- Yes, I... I am. Very well.

13:48.417 --> 13:50.209
- Are you still

13:48.417 --> 13:50.209
with Grant and Pond?

13:50.250 --> 13:51.626
- I'm not<i> with</i> them.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.918
I... I'm a part

13:51.667 --> 13:53.918
of Grant's household.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.542
- What does that mean?

13:55.584 --> 13:57.876
- I live there and such.

14:02.250 --> 14:03.876
- I need to see Grant.

14:03.918 --> 14:06.083
Can you get me a meeting

14:03.918 --> 14:06.083
with him?

14:06.834 --> 14:09.584
- I doubt he's available.

14:06.834 --> 14:09.584
Mr. Grant is headed to New York.

14:09.626 --> 14:11.709
- I have a proposition for him

14:09.626 --> 14:11.709
that won't take long.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.292
- I don't think

14:11.751 --> 14:13.292
that's a good idea.

14:17.584 --> 14:19.167
- Why's that?

14:19.209 --> 14:22.083
- A military man

14:19.209 --> 14:22.083
named Vinnicombe came to Grant's

14:22.125 --> 14:26.375
and offered to pay favour

14:22.125 --> 14:26.375
to his business

14:22.125 --> 14:26.375
if Grant helped capture you.

14:26.918 --> 14:28.751
- Me? And do what?

14:28.792 --> 14:31.125
- And take you back to England

14:28.792 --> 14:31.125
to face trial.

14:31.167 --> 14:33.959
- I'm not going back to England.

14:31.167 --> 14:33.959
- Your connection

14:31.167 --> 14:33.959
with Declan Harp

14:34.000 --> 14:36.459
and the Black Wolf Company

14:34.000 --> 14:36.459
is no secret.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.918
- Samuel Grant doesn't seem

14:37.500 --> 14:40.918
like the kind of man

14:37.500 --> 14:40.918
who would follow English law.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.709
- I don't suppose he is.

14:42.751 --> 14:46.584
He'll do... whatever gets him

14:42.751 --> 14:46.584
what he wants.

14:47.292 --> 14:50.751
- In that case,

14:47.292 --> 14:50.751
I'll take me chances. Please.

14:51.709 --> 14:55.250
- Mr. Grant is not taking

14:51.709 --> 14:55.250
business meetings at the moment.

14:55.292 --> 14:57.792
He's not in the right

14:55.292 --> 14:57.792
state of mind.

14:57.834 --> 14:59.500
He's taking a little time off.

14:59.542 --> 15:02.375
- Pond must be running things

14:59.542 --> 15:02.375
while he's away, right?

15:03.792 --> 15:05.292
Come on, Clenna.

15:06.125 --> 15:08.834
Whatever offer I make,

15:06.125 --> 15:08.834
it's gonna benefit you as well.

15:10.459 --> 15:12.334
- I can see

15:10.459 --> 15:12.334
if he'll meet with you.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.918
But I can't promise

15:12.375 --> 15:14.918
he'll be civilized.

15:25.834 --> 15:29.500
Michael Smyth is in Montreal,

15:25.834 --> 15:29.500
and he's looking

15:25.834 --> 15:29.500
to form an alliance.

15:29.542 --> 15:30.876
- He wants to speak with<i> me?</i>

15:30.918 --> 15:32.959
- Well, he asked for Grant.

15:35.667 --> 15:38.334
- We would do very well to

15:35.667 --> 15:38.334
turn him in to Major Vinnicombe.

15:39.042 --> 15:40.709
It would guarantee our immunity.

15:40.751 --> 15:42.209
- I'll not set a trap

15:40.751 --> 15:42.209
for Michael.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.167
- You don't have to. I will.

15:45.125 --> 15:47.250
It might turn Samuel's mood.

15:47.292 --> 15:50.709
- Do you want the world to know

15:47.292 --> 15:50.709
that Elizabeth Carruthers died

15:47.292 --> 15:50.709
by Grant's hand?!

15:50.751 --> 15:52.876
- Are you threatening me,

15:50.751 --> 15:52.876
Clenna?

15:53.751 --> 15:55.709
- I'm bargaining with you.

15:56.334 --> 15:59.918
- You should give

15:56.334 --> 15:59.918
a little more thought

15:56.334 --> 15:59.918
to your negotiation tactics.

16:00.792 --> 16:02.918
- If you align yourself

16:00.792 --> 16:02.918
with the HBC,

16:02.959 --> 16:05.125
you will always be beholden

16:02.959 --> 16:05.125
to them.

16:06.042 --> 16:07.918
In an alliance

16:06.042 --> 16:07.918
with the Independents,

16:07.959 --> 16:10.500
there'd be room

16:07.959 --> 16:10.500
for you to rise to the top.

16:11.792 --> 16:14.834
Do you really think the major

16:11.792 --> 16:14.834
can be taken at his word?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.417
- Fine, fine, fine.

16:21.042 --> 16:23.334
We'll meet

16:21.042 --> 16:23.334
with your little friend Michael.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.417
But Clenna...

16:28.167 --> 16:30.000
Don't ever threaten me again.

16:35.167 --> 16:36.834
- Jesus Christ.

16:37.250 --> 16:39.292
Ah.

16:37.250 --> 16:39.292
(clatter)

16:39.334 --> 16:43.042
I don't know which is worse -

16:39.334 --> 16:43.042
the fact that you cannae hold

16:39.334 --> 16:43.042
your liquor,

16:43.083 --> 16:45.209
or that you seem to be hell-bent

16:45.250 --> 16:48.125
on making business

16:45.250 --> 16:48.125
even more difficult

16:45.250 --> 16:48.125
than it's been.

16:48.792 --> 16:51.459
Sit down before you fall down.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.375
- I... I broke my...

16:53.000 --> 16:56.375
broke my glasses.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.375
(Malcolm chuckling)

16:56.417 --> 16:58.375
- You're a bloody wee fool.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.250
- Aye, aye.

17:01.751 --> 17:04.417
Because I rejected the wee boy?

17:04.459 --> 17:06.042
And Michael Smyth?

17:07.918 --> 17:09.959
What would you have me do?

17:12.417 --> 17:14.125
- Michael Smyth...

17:14.167 --> 17:17.000
offered us an alliance

17:14.167 --> 17:17.000
that is the key to our survival.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.375
- All ye can think about

17:18.000 --> 17:21.375
is the company.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.834
And all I care about

17:23.584 --> 17:26.834
is Elizabeth.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.834
(chuckling)

17:27.876 --> 17:29.876
- Then don't dishonour

17:27.876 --> 17:29.876
her memory

17:29.918 --> 17:32.000
by running her legacy

17:29.918 --> 17:32.000
into the ground!

17:32.042 --> 17:34.709
She deserves better from you,

17:32.042 --> 17:34.709
Douglas!

17:35.209 --> 17:37.709
If you love her

17:35.209 --> 17:37.709
the way you claim you do,

17:37.751 --> 17:39.459
then you will

17:37.751 --> 17:39.459
pull yourself together.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.834
- Alright.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.167
Brother.

17:52.167 --> 17:54.500
I think you need to go

17:52.167 --> 17:54.500
and sleep this off, eh?

17:56.459 --> 17:57.584
- Aye.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.459
- Malcolm, we don't have time

18:12.500 --> 18:15.876
to wait for him to dry out

18:12.500 --> 18:15.876
and smarten up.

18:16.709 --> 18:18.125
We need a deal.

18:20.709 --> 18:22.500
(Michael):<i> Clenna and I</i>

18:20.709 --> 18:22.500
<i>spent our lives</i>

18:22.542 --> 18:24.417
<i>running from big men</i>

18:22.542 --> 18:24.417
<i>with small minds.</i>

18:24.918 --> 18:27.167
But we always got

18:24.918 --> 18:27.167
the best of 'em,

18:27.209 --> 18:28.959
because we learned

18:27.209 --> 18:28.959
to work together.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.250
Now with all of Montreal

18:29.000 --> 18:31.250
in step with Samuel Grant,

18:31.292 --> 18:34.042
we'll have enough manpower

18:31.292 --> 18:34.042
to beat the HBC

18:31.292 --> 18:34.042
at their own game.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.459
- I'm sure you were adorable

18:34.083 --> 18:36.459
little children.

18:37.292 --> 18:39.876
But the New World is hardly

18:37.292 --> 18:39.876
the East End of London.

18:40.292 --> 18:42.584
Or Gravesend, for that matter.

18:42.626 --> 18:44.167
- Oh, I understand.

18:44.709 --> 18:46.709
But join my alliance,

18:46.751 --> 18:49.375
and do right by the Lake Walkers

18:46.751 --> 18:49.375
and the Voyageurs

18:46.751 --> 18:49.375
and your partners here,

18:49.417 --> 18:52.584
and we'll start to bring about

18:49.417 --> 18:52.584
the demise of the HBC -

18:49.417 --> 18:52.584
with incredible profits.

18:52.626 --> 18:55.292
- And I assume

18:52.626 --> 18:55.292
you'll be at the head

18:52.626 --> 18:55.292
of this little alliance?

18:58.542 --> 18:59.834
- That's right.

19:01.459 --> 19:04.584
- Forgive me, but the truth is

19:01.459 --> 19:04.584
that you're a thief, a con man.

19:04.626 --> 19:07.918
- And I have direct access

19:04.626 --> 19:07.918
to the Lake Walker trade.

19:08.500 --> 19:12.959
They will stop working

19:08.500 --> 19:12.959
with the HBC if I have

19:08.500 --> 19:12.959
assurances of Montreal buyers.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.709
Now, the Voyageurs,

19:13.000 --> 19:14.709
the coureurs-de-bois,

19:14.751 --> 19:16.709
they've been undermining

19:14.751 --> 19:16.709
the Company for years now,

19:16.751 --> 19:19.292
pushing further inland

19:16.751 --> 19:19.292
towards Lake Walker territory.

19:19.334 --> 19:21.292
But the problem

19:19.334 --> 19:21.292
with building an empire

19:21.334 --> 19:24.334
is wasting time and resources

19:21.334 --> 19:24.334
on defending it

19:21.334 --> 19:24.334
against your enemies.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.000
- You can bring them

19:24.375 --> 19:26.000
all together?

19:26.542 --> 19:28.751
- We all share a common hatred

19:26.542 --> 19:28.751
for the HBC.

19:29.250 --> 19:32.751
- Hmm.

19:29.250 --> 19:32.751
- The only thing the company's

19:29.250 --> 19:32.751
had on us until now

19:32.792 --> 19:36.083
is structure and organization,

19:32.792 --> 19:36.083
and that's where I come in.

19:37.167 --> 19:39.083
- It's a very ambitious plan.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.125
- All I need now is a partner

19:40.250 --> 19:43.125
who's equally as ambitious

19:43.167 --> 19:45.042
and clear-eyed

19:43.167 --> 19:45.042
to see the future.

19:46.500 --> 19:47.709
- That's cheeky.

19:50.083 --> 19:53.584
I hope you realize that

19:50.083 --> 19:53.584
you have a very loyal friend

19:50.083 --> 19:53.584
here in Clenna.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.417
- I'd like

19:54.250 --> 19:56.417
to see you both succeed.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.751
- So would I.

20:03.918 --> 20:06.292
We will make a deal

20:03.918 --> 20:06.292
on one condition.

20:07.375 --> 20:09.042
No Brown Brothers.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.375
We just don't play well

20:10.083 --> 20:12.375
together.

20:12.417 --> 20:14.876
I'm not gonna share power

20:12.417 --> 20:14.876
with them.

20:16.209 --> 20:19.000
You'll give me your word

20:16.209 --> 20:19.000
that you will not become

20:19.042 --> 20:20.834
partners with Carruthers

20:19.042 --> 20:20.834
and Company.

20:27.542 --> 20:30.250
- I'm gonna need to see

20:27.542 --> 20:30.250
some of that capital up front.

20:30.292 --> 20:32.000
As a show of faith.

20:34.042 --> 20:35.167
- Hmm.

20:36.709 --> 20:39.375
Give me a little bit of time

20:36.709 --> 20:39.375
to speak to the banker.

20:39.417 --> 20:42.000
You come back tonight,

20:39.417 --> 20:42.000
you'll have your investment.

20:56.334 --> 20:58.250
(in Cree):

20:56.334 --> 20:58.250
<i>- May we speak?</i>

20:59.083 --> 21:00.375
<i>- Of course.</i>

21:01.667 --> 21:03.250
<i>You are troubled.</i>

21:05.667 --> 21:08.834
<i>These are troubling times.</i>

21:12.125 --> 21:15.626
<i>- I feel like I know</i>

21:12.125 --> 21:15.626
<i>what my mission should be,</i>

21:15.667 --> 21:18.209
<i>but every step I take</i>

21:15.667 --> 21:18.209
<i>moves me farther from my goal.</i>

21:18.876 --> 21:22.042
<i>- Sokanon, you have lost</i>

21:18.876 --> 21:22.042
<i>someone dear to you.</i>

21:22.792 --> 21:26.500
<i>Have you properly mourned</i>

21:22.792 --> 21:26.500
<i>his death?</i>

21:28.250 --> 21:33.500
<i>- Wahush was killed</i>

21:28.250 --> 21:33.500
<i>by the carelessness</i>

21:28.250 --> 21:33.500
<i>of the white people.</i>

21:38.500 --> 21:40.918
<i>I brought them to him.</i>

21:44.375 --> 21:46.751
<i>I am to blame</i>

21:44.375 --> 21:46.751
<i>for Wahush's death.</i>

21:51.042 --> 21:54.792
<i>- Have you listened</i>

21:51.042 --> 21:54.792
<i>for his voice?</i>

21:59.667 --> 22:02.250
<i>What about the voice</i>

21:59.667 --> 22:02.250
<i>of your sister,</i>

22:02.292 --> 22:05.834
<i>Declan Harp's wife.</i>

22:02.292 --> 22:05.834
<i>Have you listened for her?</i>

22:08.500 --> 22:10.667
<i>And the mothers</i>

22:08.500 --> 22:10.667
<i>and the fathers</i>

22:08.500 --> 22:10.667
<i>long since gone?</i>

22:10.709 --> 22:13.876
<i>I have always sought guidance</i>

22:10.709 --> 22:13.876
<i>from my ancestors.</i>

22:13.918 --> 22:17.751
<i>- It's hard to stop</i>

22:13.918 --> 22:17.751
<i>and listen to my ancestors,</i>

22:19.292 --> 22:25.334
<i>when our girls and women</i>

22:19.292 --> 22:25.334
<i>are being so mistreated now.</i>

22:26.167 --> 22:28.417
<i>- This is nonsense.</i>

22:26.167 --> 22:28.417
<i>What can you do?</i>

22:28.459 --> 22:33.792
<i>- I don't know,</i>

22:28.459 --> 22:33.792
<i>that's why I came</i>

22:28.459 --> 22:33.792
<i>to seek your guidance.</i>

22:34.292 --> 22:39.792
<i>- If you cannot</i>

22:34.292 --> 22:39.792
<i>help the girls</i>

22:34.292 --> 22:39.792
<i>further north,</i>

22:41.959 --> 22:45.459
<i>where are there girls</i>

22:41.959 --> 22:45.459
<i>that you can help?</i>

22:47.000 --> 22:51.375
<i>Remember to take time</i>

22:47.000 --> 22:51.375
<i>to listen to nature.</i>

22:54.500 --> 22:56.042
<i>You'll know...</i>

22:57.500 --> 22:59.042
<i>when you listen.</i>

23:02.709 --> 23:04.292
-<i> Aha.</i>

23:07.209 --> 23:09.751
- Well, if we get caught,

23:07.209 --> 23:09.751
I'll say I took you

23:07.209 --> 23:09.751
as my prisoner.

23:09.792 --> 23:12.417
- Ah! I've seen what he can do.

23:12.876 --> 23:15.834
He's gonna cut me

23:12.876 --> 23:15.834
from me belly to me chin.

23:16.375 --> 23:18.667
- Put that out of your mind,

23:16.375 --> 23:18.667
Chaulk.

23:18.709 --> 23:20.834
- I can't!

23:18.709 --> 23:20.834
(crying)

23:20.876 --> 23:24.167
- Look, if we keep moving

23:20.876 --> 23:24.167
and you stay close,

23:20.876 --> 23:24.167
we'll be safe.

23:24.209 --> 23:27.417
Just stay close to me,

23:24.209 --> 23:27.417
you understand?

23:24.209 --> 23:27.417
- Okay, okay.

23:27.459 --> 23:29.918
- It's important you know

23:27.459 --> 23:29.918
who's on your side.

23:32.626 --> 23:34.167
Shit.

23:38.918 --> 23:43.000
-Thank God you found us!

23:38.918 --> 23:43.000
I've been trying to get away

23:38.918 --> 23:43.000
this whole time!

23:45.042 --> 23:48.667
- I took him as my prisoner.

23:45.042 --> 23:48.667
Don't hurt him.

23:51.834 --> 23:54.459
- Well, at least we know

23:51.834 --> 23:54.459
he's on his way.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.918
- Do I let this man live?

23:57.417 --> 23:59.083
- Of course not.

24:00.292 --> 24:01.709
(groaning)

24:07.000 --> 24:10.167
- This isn't her fault.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.167
I forced her into it.

24:10.209 --> 24:13.959
- Don't you worry

24:10.209 --> 24:13.959
your pretty head

24:10.209 --> 24:13.959
about our friend Chaulk.

24:14.667 --> 24:18.292
You can find a safe place

24:14.667 --> 24:18.292
to hold our guest

24:14.667 --> 24:18.292
until she is required.

24:18.334 --> 24:21.626
- What will I be required for?

24:18.334 --> 24:21.626
- Don't take your eyes off her.

24:28.083 --> 24:31.250
You, my dear Chaulk,

24:28.083 --> 24:31.250
have greatly disappointed me.

24:31.292 --> 24:33.626
- Listen, I'm sorry, sir.

24:31.292 --> 24:33.626
I'm really--

24:33.667 --> 24:38.334
- No, you're not sorry. Not yet.

24:33.667 --> 24:38.334
But you will be.

25:02.709 --> 25:03.959
- Michael.

25:08.250 --> 25:09.542
- Malcolm.

25:10.334 --> 25:11.709
How are you?

25:12.292 --> 25:13.542
- We want in.

25:14.918 --> 25:16.626
- What prompted Douglas

25:14.918 --> 25:16.626
to change his mind?

25:16.667 --> 25:18.751
He was adamant

25:16.667 --> 25:18.751
about not dealing with me.

25:21.334 --> 25:23.792
- Don't judge my brother

25:21.334 --> 25:23.792
because he's a crybaby.

25:23.834 --> 25:25.751
(chuckling)

25:23.834 --> 25:25.751
It's just in his nature.

25:27.918 --> 25:31.292
- I'm serious. I've no desire

25:27.918 --> 25:31.292
to go into business with people

25:27.918 --> 25:31.292
who want to throttle me.

25:31.334 --> 25:33.876
- Look...

25:31.334 --> 25:33.876
I talked some sense into him.

25:33.918 --> 25:38.042
Told him that this'd be a good

25:33.918 --> 25:38.042
business opportunity for us.

25:39.375 --> 25:41.792
- Well,

25:39.375 --> 25:41.792
circumstances have changed.

25:41.834 --> 25:44.125
- Since this morning?

25:41.834 --> 25:44.125
- Your brother said no,

25:44.167 --> 25:47.125
very clearly,

25:44.167 --> 25:47.125
so the offer came off the table.

25:47.167 --> 25:49.209
- Right, well, I'm putting it

25:47.167 --> 25:49.209
back on the table now,

25:49.250 --> 25:51.834
because the way I see it

25:49.250 --> 25:51.834
is you owe us this, Michael.

25:53.167 --> 25:56.417
- I've made a deal

25:53.167 --> 25:56.417
with Samuel Grant.

25:53.167 --> 25:56.417
It's exclusive.

25:56.459 --> 25:59.751
And I see no reason why

25:56.459 --> 25:59.751
he'd want to go into business

25:56.459 --> 25:59.751
with you.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.334
- I don't care a shite about

25:59.792 --> 26:02.334
Samuel Grant or what he wants.

26:02.375 --> 26:05.334
This is about you and me,

26:02.375 --> 26:05.334
Carruthers and Black Wolf,

26:05.375 --> 26:07.000
doing business together.

26:07.751 --> 26:09.709
We all need this, Michael.

26:15.876 --> 26:19.500
- If you can get your brother

26:15.876 --> 26:19.500
to sign an agreement,

26:15.876 --> 26:19.500
then maybe we can talk.

26:19.542 --> 26:22.918
Otherwise, this conversation's

26:19.542 --> 26:22.918
a waste of time

26:19.542 --> 26:22.918
without a contract.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.250
- I'll have it sorted before

26:25.417 --> 26:28.250
you leave for the frontier.

26:57.209 --> 27:01.959
(in Cree):

26:57.209 --> 27:01.959
<i>Omaciw and I said we would stay</i>

26:57.209 --> 27:01.959
<i>by your side, and we will.</i>

27:02.417 --> 27:04.125
<i>- I am impressed</i>

27:04.167 --> 27:10.042
<i>that you have</i>

27:04.167 --> 27:10.042
<i>taken up the cause</i>

27:04.167 --> 27:10.042
<i>so sincerely.</i>

27:10.083 --> 27:13.000
<i>- This is nonsense.</i>

27:10.083 --> 27:13.000
<i>We believe in what you believe.</i>

27:13.042 --> 27:16.459
<i>For too long, the injustices</i>

27:13.042 --> 27:16.459
<i>to the People have continued.</i>

27:16.500 --> 27:20.500
<i>If it means</i>

27:16.500 --> 27:20.500
<i>we have to fight for justice,</i>

27:16.500 --> 27:20.500
<i>then so be it.</i>

27:20.542 --> 27:24.834
<i>If it means we have to die</i>

27:20.542 --> 27:24.834
<i>for justice, then so be it.</i>

27:26.042 --> 27:30.250
<i>- Kamenna needs</i>

27:26.042 --> 27:30.250
<i>your protection.</i>

27:26.042 --> 27:30.250
<i>This time I go alone.</i>

27:30.292 --> 27:31.834
<i>- Where are you going?</i>

27:32.542 --> 27:34.000
- Fort James.

27:34.042 --> 27:36.042
- Ah.

27:36.083 --> 27:39.167
<i>This is nonsense.</i>

27:36.083 --> 27:39.167
<i>Beware the Irishman</i>

27:36.083 --> 27:39.167
<i>with the Haudenosaunee wife.</i>

27:40.167 --> 27:41.209
<i>- Yes.</i>

27:53.125 --> 27:57.459
- So there's me,

27:53.125 --> 27:57.459
giving her a quick knee trim

27:53.125 --> 27:57.459
while up against a white tree.

27:57.500 --> 28:00.042
- That certainly sounds like

27:57.500 --> 28:00.042
one hell of a first impression.

28:00.083 --> 28:03.125
- Ah, but she was a good 50

28:00.083 --> 28:03.125
pounds heavier than me, Charlie.

28:03.167 --> 28:05.834
So I'm the one

28:03.167 --> 28:05.834
being tossed about

28:03.167 --> 28:05.834
like a rag doll, so I am--

28:06.500 --> 28:07.709
What the fuck?!

28:07.751 --> 28:10.083
- Shhh! Get over here!

28:10.125 --> 28:11.334
- Ah...

28:18.667 --> 28:21.042
- Did you go back to get this?

28:18.667 --> 28:21.042
- No!

28:22.292 --> 28:24.292
Well... aye!

28:24.334 --> 28:25.709
- Unbelievable.

28:26.751 --> 28:28.459
Come on, Charlie. Let's go.

28:33.918 --> 28:34.959
(groaning)

28:54.167 --> 28:57.000
- Thank you.

28:54.167 --> 28:57.000
This will be put to good use.

28:57.042 --> 28:59.751
- The future of this deal

28:57.042 --> 28:59.751
depends on our being able

28:57.042 --> 28:59.751
to trust one another.

28:59.792 --> 29:01.751
- As do all deals, I suppose.

29:01.792 --> 29:04.792
- Mr. Grant and I

29:01.792 --> 29:04.792
will be the best partners

29:01.792 --> 29:04.792
that you've ever had.

29:04.834 --> 29:08.375
But if you betray us, Michael?

29:04.834 --> 29:08.375
We will be unforgiving.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.250
- Then you better remember

29:09.542 --> 29:11.250
that Grant's only access

29:11.292 --> 29:13.250
to the Lake Walker trade

29:11.292 --> 29:13.250
is through me,

29:13.292 --> 29:16.626
and that this deal only works

29:13.292 --> 29:16.626
if you and Grant

29:13.292 --> 29:16.626
hold up your end.

29:17.584 --> 29:22.500
- Mr. Grant and I are both

29:17.584 --> 29:22.500
steadfast in our desire to see

29:17.584 --> 29:22.500
the HBC brought to its knees.

29:25.167 --> 29:27.042
- Good. Let's get started.

29:29.584 --> 29:31.876
- Michael.

29:29.584 --> 29:31.876
- I'll walk you out.

29:37.375 --> 29:40.292
Look at you, acting like

29:37.375 --> 29:40.292
a real man of business.

29:41.959 --> 29:43.626
- Thank you for trusting me.

29:45.375 --> 29:49.542
- You're dying

29:45.375 --> 29:49.542
to get back out there,

29:45.375 --> 29:49.542
aren't you? To the frontier.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.209
- It's my kind of business.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.167
- Will I see you again

29:55.000 --> 29:57.167
when you come back?

29:58.000 --> 30:00.584
Or were you just using me

29:58.000 --> 30:00.584
to get your business deal?

30:00.626 --> 30:02.709
- I'm not using you.

30:00.626 --> 30:02.709
- Yes, you are.

30:07.209 --> 30:09.459
But... be assured...

30:10.792 --> 30:13.417
...I'm using you just as much.

30:15.125 --> 30:16.626
- Is that so?

30:18.500 --> 30:21.584
- I suppose you're going to see

30:18.500 --> 30:21.584
that Native woman

30:18.500 --> 30:21.584
who wants to kill me?

30:21.626 --> 30:23.959
- She doesn't want much to do

30:21.626 --> 30:23.959
with me right now.

30:24.542 --> 30:26.250
- Because of me?

30:33.292 --> 30:34.834
- I have to go.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.834
- Was that a bittersweet

30:48.834 --> 30:50.834
goodbye?

30:58.459 --> 31:00.584
Do you think

30:58.459 --> 31:00.584
Michael's lying to me

31:00.626 --> 31:02.709
about his dealings

31:00.626 --> 31:02.709
with the Browns?

31:03.459 --> 31:06.792
- Some time ago, I would've been

31:03.459 --> 31:06.792
certain of Michael's word.

31:06.834 --> 31:08.751
But now I'm not so sure.

31:09.667 --> 31:13.876
His word means far less to him

31:09.667 --> 31:13.876
than his business, it seems.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.334
- Good night.

31:28.709 --> 31:31.834
- I'm surprised.

31:28.709 --> 31:31.834
I thought there was no chance

31:28.709 --> 31:31.834
of Douglas giving in.

31:31.876 --> 31:34.125
- Oh, I set him straight.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.751
A new partnership

31:34.626 --> 31:36.751
calls for a wee celebration.

31:36.792 --> 31:38.667
Would you like a glass

31:36.792 --> 31:38.667
of something?

31:38.709 --> 31:40.792
I'm sure we have a bottle

31:38.709 --> 31:40.792
of Madeira hidden in the cellar.

31:40.834 --> 31:44.417
- No. Thank you,

31:40.834 --> 31:44.417
but I best be going.

32:01.751 --> 32:03.167
- You should go with him.

32:20.667 --> 32:21.876
- Michael!

32:26.751 --> 32:29.584
- What now?

32:26.751 --> 32:29.584
- I'm going with you.

32:29.626 --> 32:31.834
I need to make sure

32:29.626 --> 32:31.834
the Carruthers Company's

32:31.876 --> 32:34.626
best interests

32:31.876 --> 32:34.626
are being secured.

32:35.334 --> 32:37.959
- I gave you me word, didn't I?

32:35.334 --> 32:37.959
- Oh, aye.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.626
Just like you gave Samuel Grant

32:38.000 --> 32:41.626
your word that you wouldn't

32:38.000 --> 32:41.626
do business with us.

32:41.667 --> 32:43.209
And see how that turned out.

32:45.959 --> 32:48.918
- Well, that just proves

32:45.959 --> 32:48.918
I'm willing to tell a white lie

32:45.959 --> 32:48.918
for the greater good.

32:48.959 --> 32:52.125
How are we supposed

32:48.959 --> 32:52.125
to be business partners

32:48.959 --> 32:52.125
if you can't trust me?

32:52.167 --> 32:56.751
- By me keeping one eye on you

32:52.167 --> 32:56.751
all the fucking time.

32:58.167 --> 32:59.542
Now let's go.

33:10.042 --> 33:14.125
- Now, my dear, are you ready?

33:10.042 --> 33:14.125
- Ready for what?

33:14.167 --> 33:17.626
- For your long-awaited reunion

33:14.167 --> 33:17.626
with Declan Harp, of course.

33:18.459 --> 33:20.626
- I know it's not that simple.

33:20.667 --> 33:25.459
- No. Perhaps more ships

33:20.667 --> 33:25.459
passing in the night, eh?

33:20.667 --> 33:25.459
(chuckling)

33:25.500 --> 33:27.709
- Where is this all leading,

33:25.500 --> 33:27.709
Lord Benton?

33:27.751 --> 33:29.542
Do you really think

33:27.751 --> 33:29.542
your mutual desire

33:29.584 --> 33:32.250
to annihilate one another

33:29.584 --> 33:32.250
ends in some sort of salvation?

33:32.751 --> 33:36.667
- Mr. Harp has long since

33:32.751 --> 33:36.667
thrown down a gauntlet.

33:37.876 --> 33:40.334
I am a lord, a gentleman,

33:40.375 --> 33:43.792
and it is my duty

33:40.375 --> 33:43.792
to answer that call.

33:43.834 --> 33:46.334
Anything less

33:43.834 --> 33:46.334
would be irredeemable.

33:47.334 --> 33:50.209
- I will not help you

33:47.334 --> 33:50.209
to kill Declan Harp.

33:50.250 --> 33:52.500
- Who said anything

33:50.250 --> 33:52.500
about killing?

33:54.000 --> 33:56.250
Despite what notions

33:54.000 --> 33:56.250
you may have of me,

33:56.292 --> 33:58.584
I am an honourable man.

33:58.626 --> 34:02.876
And so I shall promise Harp

33:58.626 --> 34:02.876
a fair trial in London.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.626
I cannot say what may

34:03.542 --> 34:06.626
become of him thereafter.

34:06.667 --> 34:10.918
- Putting Declan Harp on trial

34:06.667 --> 34:10.918
in London will be worse

34:06.667 --> 34:10.918
than trying to cage a bear.

34:14.959 --> 34:19.083
- When I took Harp into my home,

34:14.959 --> 34:19.083
he was but a mongrel pup.

34:19.876 --> 34:21.834
He was barely house-trained.

34:22.542 --> 34:25.083
I made him into the man

34:22.542 --> 34:25.083
he is today.

34:26.542 --> 34:30.083
But Declan Harp is the architect

34:26.542 --> 34:30.083
of his own demise.

34:30.667 --> 34:33.918
He sealed his own fate

34:30.667 --> 34:33.918
a long time ago.

34:35.250 --> 34:41.000
However, since I can't have you

34:35.250 --> 34:41.000
alerting him to my intentions,

34:41.042 --> 34:44.500
I'm afraid Wadlow

34:41.042 --> 34:44.500
may have to fetch a muzzle.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.334
- He will kill you first.

34:49.584 --> 34:50.959
- We shall see.

34:51.918 --> 34:53.876
(Wadlow):

34:51.918 --> 34:53.876
Make sure your men are ready!

34:53.918 --> 34:57.250
Once he knows she's here,

34:53.918 --> 34:57.250
he'll make his move!

34:57.292 --> 35:02.209
We're gonna let him get

34:57.292 --> 35:02.209
within sniffing distance of her

34:57.292 --> 35:02.209
before we make our move.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.667
- They're all gonna jump

35:18.083 --> 35:20.667
at the chance to kill you.

35:20.709 --> 35:23.584
- Yeah, which means

35:20.709 --> 35:23.584
they're gonna jump at the chance

35:20.709 --> 35:23.584
to kill us, too.

35:23.626 --> 35:25.667
- Aye,

35:23.626 --> 35:25.667
once they're done killin' Harp.

35:25.709 --> 35:28.626
- You two aren't going in.

35:25.709 --> 35:28.626
- Alright,

35:25.709 --> 35:28.626
you're going on your own?

35:28.667 --> 35:30.292
It makes no sense,

35:28.667 --> 35:30.292
that sort of thing.

35:30.334 --> 35:32.667
- I'm just gonna go down there

35:30.334 --> 35:32.667
and have a quick chat.

35:33.334 --> 35:35.292
You're gonna stay here

35:33.334 --> 35:35.292
and try not to be you.

35:35.334 --> 35:37.375
Charlie, cover my ass, 'cause...

35:37.751 --> 35:39.709
you're the best shot

35:37.751 --> 35:39.709
out of all three of us.

35:39.751 --> 35:41.584
- Much obliged.

35:41.626 --> 35:44.375
- Now, had he said that

35:41.626 --> 35:44.375
when that English prick

35:41.626 --> 35:44.375
was on our way,

35:44.417 --> 35:47.667
we wouldn't be rushing around

35:44.417 --> 35:47.667
trying to cobble

35:44.417 --> 35:47.667
this plan together, would we?

35:47.709 --> 35:50.292
- Maybe you can try

35:47.709 --> 35:50.292
doing something constructive

35:47.709 --> 35:50.292
with your mouth.

35:50.334 --> 35:52.918
- I've been known to listen

35:50.334 --> 35:52.918
to some critical feedback

35:50.334 --> 35:52.918
now and then.

35:52.959 --> 35:54.167
- Shut up.

35:58.209 --> 36:00.584
- You sure you don't want

35:58.209 --> 36:00.584
a wee dram?

36:01.334 --> 36:03.667
Could be your last,

36:01.334 --> 36:03.667
you mad bastard.

36:07.042 --> 36:09.918
- I'm gonna rip open

36:07.042 --> 36:09.918
the gates of hell

36:07.042 --> 36:09.918
with the death I bring.

36:13.584 --> 36:14.834
(satisfied sigh)

36:15.375 --> 36:18.417
The devil can't hold 'em.

36:15.375 --> 36:18.417
Benton's mine.

36:20.584 --> 36:22.959
- Well... you heard that.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.751
- I think what he's trying

36:23.000 --> 36:24.751
to say is,

36:24.792 --> 36:26.417
he wants me to follow him.

36:38.542 --> 36:39.834
(Grace moaning)

36:41.209 --> 36:42.292
- Argh...

36:41.209 --> 36:42.292
(Grace exclaiming)

36:55.042 --> 36:57.292
(Grace whimpering)

37:08.709 --> 37:11.209
- Any of you

37:08.709 --> 37:11.209
don't know who I am,

37:11.250 --> 37:13.250
I'm Declan Harp.

37:14.709 --> 37:16.667
Any of you who don't want

37:14.709 --> 37:16.667
to die tonight...

37:18.459 --> 37:19.876
...leave now.

37:20.209 --> 37:23.083
- Hold your ground!

37:23.417 --> 37:28.083
Any one of you moves

37:23.417 --> 37:28.083
to leave his post...

37:28.125 --> 37:30.876
(growling)

37:28.125 --> 37:30.876
(grunting)

37:30.918 --> 37:32.584
(groaning)

37:34.334 --> 37:36.542
- What'd you say your name was?

37:40.250 --> 37:41.876
- Wadlow.

37:43.042 --> 37:44.542
- Rough childhood.

37:44.584 --> 37:47.709
- You've made a grave mistake

37:44.584 --> 37:47.709
coming here, Mr. Harp.

37:48.667 --> 37:53.542
I've dedicated my life

37:48.667 --> 37:53.542
to huntin' filthy beasts

37:53.584 --> 37:55.292
such as yourself.

37:56.250 --> 38:00.792
I look forward to adding

37:56.250 --> 38:00.792
your head to my wall.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.125
- Let Grace go.

38:05.167 --> 38:07.125
- You're in no position

38:05.167 --> 38:07.125
to make demands.

38:07.584 --> 38:10.709
I'm under orders to execute you

38:07.584 --> 38:10.709
if you don't come quietly.

38:11.459 --> 38:13.292
- I tell you what, Wad-blow.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.500
I'll come quietly...

38:16.292 --> 38:18.250
if you let my Grace go

38:18.292 --> 38:20.667
and you have your men

38:18.292 --> 38:20.667
fire off their weapons

38:18.292 --> 38:20.667
so I know that she's safe.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.334
- Alright.

38:24.709 --> 38:26.083
Men...

38:26.918 --> 38:28.417
Ready...

38:28.959 --> 38:30.000
aim...

38:30.709 --> 38:31.792
fire!

38:37.125 --> 38:38.542
(moaning)

38:40.083 --> 38:41.542
- That's enough.

38:50.792 --> 38:51.959
Grace.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.584
(muffled scream)

38:58.459 --> 39:00.125
No!!!

39:01.167 --> 39:03.000
Where is she?!

39:25.626 --> 39:26.500
- Ugh!

39:28.667 --> 39:29.876
(man exclaiming)

39:29.918 --> 39:31.375
(shouting)

39:34.542 --> 39:35.959
- Who the fuck are you?!

39:36.459 --> 39:37.459
- Aaah...!

39:57.000 --> 39:58.417
- Shit.

39:58.459 --> 40:01.042
(struggle grunts and shouts)

40:08.584 --> 40:10.125
(Charlie): Aaah!

40:25.834 --> 40:28.834
(dramatic music)

40:36.250 --> 40:37.709
(Charlie exclaiming)

40:39.042 --> 40:40.250
(McTaggart shouting)

40:51.834 --> 40:52.959
Argh!

41:01.667 --> 41:04.125
- Get up. Up, dog!

41:07.667 --> 41:10.125
(grunting, choking)

41:11.959 --> 41:15.584
(dramatic music)

42:03.125 --> 42:06.125
(roaring)
