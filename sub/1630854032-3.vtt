WEBVTT

00:06.881 --> 00:10.635
Oh my god, I cannot fucking believe this,
here we fucking go!

00:11.720 --> 00:12.637
Jeez!

00:14.389 --> 00:17.642
Pardon the interruption.
We are once again in the federal clear.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.270
Rick what the hell?
Are you a Turkey Dracula now?

00:20.353 --> 00:21.688
Morty, is that a Pooplickian GamePod?

00:22.063 --> 00:23.523
Actually it’s the GamePod XL.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.692
They say it’s the most realistic
video game console ever.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.694
-I never got you that.
-Space Mom did.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.612
She’s in for the holiday weekend.
Remember?

00:29.696 --> 00:31.364
Shit, in that case, let’s go,

00:31.448 --> 00:33.241
-let’s get out of h...
-I heard you smack the glass, Dad,

00:33.324 --> 00:35.702
-if you bail, I’ll disown you!
-I’d say don’t hop through a portal.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.328
But wait, you can’t.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.414
Look at it this way, Morty.

00:39.497 --> 00:42.542
Life is a subscription and Thanksgiving
is your family’s yearly charge.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.169
Wow Dad, good job.

00:44.586 --> 00:49.132
Rick, put some pants on.
Today has so few rules.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.258
Yes, Patriarch.

00:52.969 --> 00:58.600
I’d like to make a toast.
Today is a day for thanks. And for family.

00:58.683 --> 01:01.436
And for remembering
all of those that have less.

01:01.519 --> 01:03.438
-Okay, pick a scope.
-Pick a scope?

01:03.521 --> 01:07.150
-Can we please have a normal Thanksgiving?
-Well seems like all the ones I remember.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.276
Good point.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.529
Baby, you, it’s a toast.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.572
-Sorry!
-Sorry!

01:14.449 --> 01:18.912
Anyway, I’m thankful for my wife.
Beth. The Beth that chose me.

01:19.412 --> 01:23.583
I’m so grateful to you, and I literally
could not live without you.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.586
I really mean that.
If something were to happen to you,

01:26.961 --> 01:29.506
or if you were to leave me,
or be unfaithful, I would die.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.300
Literally. Probably by my own hand.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.511
-Okay.
-I know how I’d do it.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.387
Our first blender has an extra long cord

01:36.471 --> 01:39.641
and it was manufactured before
safety fuses, so I’d draw a warm bath...

01:40.016 --> 01:42.602
And blend some stuff, good toast, honey.
To thankfulness.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.481
-To... America?
-To ending the toast?

01:46.564 --> 01:48.525
-To ending the toast.
-To ending the toast.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.653
Just to, be clear,
I was saying I’d kill myself.

01:51.986 --> 01:53.321
-God.
-God, we know.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.649
-Sorry Jerry got all husband-y.
-Yeah. Do not miss that.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.193
So I was thinking we could set you up
in Jerry’s man cave?

02:32.277 --> 02:34.654
That’s okay, I’ll sleep in my car.
It’s got a Tardis thing going on,

02:34.737 --> 02:39.200
bigger on the inside. Dad calls it hack,
but my soaking tub begs to differ.

02:39.617 --> 02:43.371
Maybe I’ll trade you... my lower back.

02:43.454 --> 02:47.333
-I got this.
-Jesus, that was great.

02:47.417 --> 02:52.380
Well, you’re me.
I find this is usually the biggest help.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.385
I just love... the Venusian stuff.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.679
It’s cool, I get insecure trying
to pronounce this crap too

02:59.762 --> 03:01.681
but I got just the thing for that. Here.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.699
Okay shoot that asteroid.
Now shoot that one.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.327
Now shoot me in the face.
This game’s trash.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.412
I didn’t want to say anything
but this does seem lame.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.706
I thought it was maybe cause
we’ve shot so many real asteroids

03:26.789 --> 03:27.707
let’s look at the menu

03:28.291 --> 03:29.667
There’s the realism setting.

03:29.751 --> 03:32.587
Cool. Also stupid.
The factory setting is 4?

03:32.670 --> 03:33.630
What do we want, 10?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.673
No, do 9, I’m kidding.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.634
-Shut up, Summer.
-Shut up Summer. Put ten.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.181
-This is the same.
-It’s worse. It’s...

03:43.681 --> 03:47.352
I get it. Okay. It’s more real.
The vast majority of space is empty.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.729
What? Who cares?
Then what am I doing?

03:50.688 --> 03:53.441
Looks like you can record a video
for your kid in case you die.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.652
Not a bad idea, you’re gonna be
in space for a while.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.279
May as well.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.616
Son. If you’re seeing this,

04:01.699 --> 04:04.619
I starved to death while
looking for an asteroid.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.331
This is stupid. You guys are obviously
just trying to convince yourselves

04:08.414 --> 04:10.208
it’s cool because you feel lame about it.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.251
Summer you know nothing
about gamer culture.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.711
Bro, tell your son you love
the shit out of him.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.088
I’m gonna!

04:24.222 --> 04:26.307
Of course we both can’t sleep
at the same time.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.393
We do share a shitty back.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.645
-Turn around. At least let me...
-Yes please.

04:31.562 --> 04:34.399
-My God.
-Okay I know we’re not massage people

04:34.482 --> 04:37.610
but you need this. See you act
like this bad ass space cowboy

04:37.694 --> 04:42.615
but I know you’re just a scared little
overachiever that keeps all her OCD right.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.492
-My God.
-Yeah.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.786
By the way you better
be taking notes, I’m next.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.330
-It’s my back you dumb bitch.
-Nice.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.165
What?

04:59.549 --> 05:01.467
-Well I better get back to bed.
-Same

05:06.723 --> 05:09.350
So now you’re into highly
realistic video games?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.686
Maybe I decided real life
was too much right now

05:11.769 --> 05:13.730
or maybe I’m not afraid to change
my mind about stuff,

05:14.230 --> 05:17.275
maybe mental flexibility is
stronger than stubbornness.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.528
Nice manip’, Sum-Sum.
Okay, I’m in the alley behind the library.

05:20.611 --> 05:22.613
-Uptown or downtown?
-Shit, there’s one uptown, too?

05:22.697 --> 05:24.532
It’s okay, stay there,
I think I’m near the red line.

05:24.615 --> 05:27.326
-Is this Street Fighter?
-Street Fighter where you start

05:27.410 --> 05:30.329
at the beginning of each fighter’s day
and have to find each other to fight.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.665
It’s very realistic.
Not even guaranteed a fight will happen.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.501
That meter filling up is us forgetting
what made us so mad.

05:35.585 --> 05:39.714
If anyone’s interested in a higher level
of realism, I’m “booting up” the O.G.

05:40.381 --> 05:44.552
That’s Original Game,
called a jigsaw puzzle, in the den.

05:45.762 --> 05:48.723
Hey, gang! Me and my space self are gonna
make a run to the Gloppy Drop System

05:48.806 --> 05:51.225
for ice cream. Any flavor requests?

05:51.309 --> 05:51.768
-Vanilla!
-Vanilla!

05:51.851 --> 05:55.313
Why do you guys have to go all the way
to deep space just for ice cream?

05:55.396 --> 05:57.565
Gloppy Dropulites have less
taste buds than humans,

05:57.648 --> 05:59.400
their ice cream is like a hospital bed,

05:59.484 --> 06:01.569
it’s designed for you to do less
so it does more.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.237
Okay see ya in a bit.

06:03.613 --> 06:07.325
I’ll get started sorting all the obvious
sky pieces. Secret technique.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.659
-Oh fuck it’s ON, bitch!
-Oh shit there you are!

06:08.743 --> 06:11.370
-I’m gonna eat your ass.
-You will die in the street like a dog!

06:14.707 --> 06:15.708
Stunning.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.253
Thank you. This is incredible.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.173
Just glad I had something in your size.

06:24.383 --> 06:28.262
How far is Gloppy Drop? And why
do I always think I’m wearing a watch?

06:28.346 --> 06:31.474
I actually have a pint of Gloppy Drop
on a little apartment orbiting Earth.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.477
-So we have time.
-You have your own space station?

06:34.811 --> 06:37.605
We have our own space station.
We’re the same person.

06:37.688 --> 06:41.692
There’s differences. Like, one of us
has no idea who she really is.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.611
Wrong. But let’s make a deal.

06:43.694 --> 06:47.406
Let’s trust ourselves enough to stop
wondering who we are when we’re together.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.950
We get to say anything to each other.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.953
Things we’d never say to anyone else,
even ourselves.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.788
What don’t we say to ourselves?

06:54.288 --> 06:57.500
How about my ass looks good
in that space suit.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.585
I mean it. I’m a good looking woman.

06:59.669 --> 07:00.920
Well that’s nice of you to say.

07:01.420 --> 07:05.967
I also... find myself...
quite attractive.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.229
We forgot the ice cream.

07:20.314 --> 07:23.276
I want you back in my guts like
I’m one of your sick little fillies.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.328
Goddammit, Morty!
You can’t just take my controller.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.496
Yes I can! It’s mine.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.541
-Okay, Sum-Sum, gimme.
-Make your own controller,

07:38.624 --> 07:40.293
some of us need
all the control we can get.

07:40.710 --> 07:41.627
Fuck you!

07:42.712 --> 07:45.423
So why are you so suddenly
into realistic video games?

07:45.506 --> 07:48.426
-I already was.
-But now you’re into them the way I am.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.511
You mean like staring at them
in a numb trance.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.805
Not judging, just noticing.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.600
You tend to notice stuff
a little before I do.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.018
But eventually you do notice.

07:57.101 --> 07:59.520
And now we can both
not notice together, yes.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.688
My god, Beth?!

08:01.522 --> 08:02.940
I thought you said you got ice cream?

08:03.816 --> 08:07.695
-I. It must be in the...
-The car! We left it in the car.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.573
Okay, good,
because that would have been weird!

08:10.656 --> 08:12.700
I worry things might become
more and more noticeable.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.036
And if he kills himself
we’re gonna have to get a new dad

08:15.411 --> 08:16.704
Jesus Christ, Summer!

08:20.708 --> 08:24.003
-Dad. What’s this?
-Making a controller.

08:24.378 --> 08:27.715
This species of bionic space whale has
carbon wiring, great for smooth gameplay.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.717
I’m not killing it, for the record.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.678
I’m just replacing its esophagus
with a better one. For free.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.556
It should thank me.
And it will, with its mind.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.725
These things are telepathic, Beth,
they talk to you in dreams.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.771
Does your replicator thing make ice cream
from the Gloppy Drop system?

08:42.104 --> 08:44.982
Why would you want replicated
Gloppy Drop ice cream, poser?

08:45.066 --> 08:48.736
Crazy thing, I went with Space Beth
to get some and we had such a great time

08:48.819 --> 08:51.614
we forgot the ice cream. Crazy right?

08:51.697 --> 08:54.492
-That’s a real question?
-Maybe?

08:54.575 --> 08:55.534
Come here, hold the pup down.

08:56.452 --> 08:57.745
You’re talking about an infinite father.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.789
I’ve met myself out
there infinite times...

08:59.872 --> 09:03.668
Infinite shit happens. Including,
as you put it, forgetting the ice cream.

09:03.751 --> 09:07.505
-You’ve... forgotten the ice cream?
-Drill me for details when I’m drunker.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.757
In the meantime,
don’t worry about what’s crazy.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.761
-I’know, as the kids say, you do you.
-Thanks. Thank you so much, Dad.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.096
One thing to keep in mind, though.

09:15.471 --> 09:18.099
It’s not just your own ice cream
you’re forgetting. It’s your family’s.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.643
If you forget it too much,
you start having to keep secrets.

09:20.726 --> 09:24.063
-And you’re against secrets.
-Against? Hell no. Secrets are great.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.067
For instance, I’ve had a pint of vanilla
Gloppy Drop in my fridge this whole time.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.069
Take it. I’m just saying, lies pile up.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.114
Like credit card debt. You retain
an advantage by staying liquid.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.702
Gotcha. Well. I’d call this
a simple cash transaction.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.079
Fun. And. Done.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.463
Favorite Culkin?

09:49.547 --> 09:50.464
-Kieran!
-Kieran!

09:51.048 --> 09:52.008
Favorite song by Britney?

09:52.091 --> 09:53.009
-Work Bitch!
-Work Bitch!

09:53.092 --> 09:54.093
Favorite hangover cure?

09:54.176 --> 09:55.052
-Hair of the dog
-Hair of the dog

09:55.136 --> 09:56.679
with a guilty pleasure like
Humans Weekly.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.812
I told Dad.
I mean I didn’t have to. He knew.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.523
I guess that’s one reason
you didn’t have to tell him.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.152
What’d he say?

10:11.235 --> 10:13.571
We kind of talked in code,
I think he said it’s fine

10:13.654 --> 10:16.157
until it makes us feel
indebted to our lessers.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.658
That sounds like Dad.

10:17.742 --> 10:21.037
Do... we... owe...
the family an explanation?

10:21.120 --> 10:24.081
Do we have to spend our time together
figuring out how to please others?

10:24.165 --> 10:28.127
I’m married.
We both are but I’m in our marriage.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.129
It’s the defining difference between us.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.506
Well there’s no rule book
that says you have to be.

10:34.091 --> 10:39.180
What’s gonna happen? What is this?
Are we in love? With ourself?

10:39.263 --> 10:42.767
I mean, does that make us the most or
the least healthy woman in the universe?

10:42.850 --> 10:46.729
Anybody ever tell you you’re
overly analytical? Which I do love?

10:47.188 --> 10:49.857
-If that’s what you need to call it?
-I don’t need to call it anything.

10:50.733 --> 10:56.072
-I would like to know... its shelf life.
-I might know a way to gather that data.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.740
-The Holodeck!
-Motel Room!

10:57.823 --> 10:58.783
I like yours better.

11:06.832 --> 11:12.171
Beth! My Beth! Well, not “my”
Beth, but... I finished! It’s done!

11:13.172 --> 11:16.759
Kids do you know where your moms are?
Oh you’re busy with your GamePod,

11:16.842 --> 11:19.053
don’t worry about it,
I’ll find those two somewhere

11:19.136 --> 11:23.724
No!
No, dad, come play videogames with us.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.143
Okay Dad here’s the infinite menu screen.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.728
-I dunno.
-Here, here,

11:27.812 --> 11:29.563
I’ll have the console choose a game!

11:31.565 --> 11:32.650
Maybe let’s skip this one?

11:32.733 --> 11:34.110
Really? Why? Looks fun!

11:37.279 --> 11:41.659
So we are a woman married to a man but
having a sexual affair with another woman!

11:42.159 --> 11:45.663
-Very spicy.
-Very spicy, Jer. Good job.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.665
Looks pretty single player, kids?

11:54.255 --> 11:58.092
Seriously you two?! What the hell
did you do in my holodeck?!

11:59.176 --> 12:02.096
Holy shit, you did a full
‘San Junipero’ in here?

12:02.179 --> 12:05.599
My god, Beth, there’s masturbating
and then there’s masturbating.

12:05.683 --> 12:07.685
-Dad stop, I’m sorry!
-You’d know, old man.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.271
Look, this isn’t my business
and by all means

12:10.646 --> 12:14.150
enjoy being sapphic horse girls together.
But you suck at doing it secretly.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.610
-We all know.
-Including Jerry?!

12:16.694 --> 12:18.779
No, Dad’s so in the dark
that he’s enjoying a video game

12:18.863 --> 12:20.239
about being in an affair right now.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.158
If you guys are doing this,
you gotta tell him.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.702
-Okay, little man, back off.
-Take it easy. They’re right.

12:24.785 --> 12:27.288
Right about what, that we
have to be twice as considerate

12:27.371 --> 12:30.666
and twice as repressed because
some dick split us in two?

12:30.750 --> 12:34.044
This is the shit I left.
This isn’t. This is me.

12:34.128 --> 12:38.132
This is the me that doesn’t tell you all
to fuck off. So allow me. Fuck off.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.718
She’ll tell her husband what she wants
when she feels like it.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.720
And you can deal with it
or you can deal with me.

12:42.803 --> 12:45.181
But you should know
I have all the Predator weapons.

12:46.807 --> 12:47.808
-Works for me.
-That’s cool.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.768
-Fair enough.
-I guess it’s time for ice cream.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.271
Come on, kids, you’re inhaling this stuff.

12:52.688 --> 12:56.066
Your Moms went to space,
did you even thank them for doing it?

12:57.693 --> 13:00.070
Thanks for... doing it, Moms.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.322
Very selfless of you.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.325
Eat your ice cream however you want.
Nothing good lasts forever.

13:10.247 --> 13:14.710
Okay, c’mon, it’s Thanksgiving,
the least we can do is speak English.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.296
Jerry, I had sex with your wife.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.758
Or, I’m your wife and had sex
with the clone you sleep with.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.259
Your pick. We had sex. We loved it.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.181
Beth Sanchez sure is something?

13:28.432 --> 13:31.143
-I think I’ll ask her to prom.
-Jerry. For your own sake.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.853
Stay away from Beth Sanchez.

13:32.937 --> 13:36.357
-Worst case, she says “no”.
-No, Jerry. Worst case she says “yes”.

13:36.732 --> 13:41.195
She’s too much woman for you. Maybe
she’d find your simple naïveté endearing

13:41.278 --> 13:44.198
but she’s intense.
Sooner or later, she’d tear you apart.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.160
I’d be lucky to be torn apart
by Beth Sanchez.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.169
-What the fuck?!
-Dad’s a bug! Dad rolled into a bug!

13:57.253 --> 14:00.089
Forgot I installed that.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.386
-Why does Jerry have a Pill Bug Protocol?
-It’s an emotional defense system.

14:05.469 --> 14:06.720
I got drunk with Jerry one night

14:06.804 --> 14:08.055
and he said it’s what he wanted
most in the world.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.474
Don’t blame me, I wanted tattoos

14:10.558 --> 14:13.060
Anyway, he’s in perfect health in there
and he can unroll when he chooses to

14:13.143 --> 14:16.063
but can also stay in metabolic
hibernation pretty much indefinitely.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.065
It’s a cool power to have,
like if you have to fly coach

14:18.440 --> 14:20.985
or if Summer asks you what you thought
of ‘Wonder Woman 1984

14:21.068 --> 14:22.778
-How do we undo it?
-Only he can.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.739
That’s the point. It’s total safety.
Even I can’t reverse it.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.410
If you try to pry him out and hit a nerve,
he’ll literally turn into a Shrek.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.537
In his own sad way,
he’s taken control.

14:31.620 --> 14:35.040
This is classic Jerry. He’d rather
be a bug than have a conversation.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.418
Have you heard the way
you start conversations?

14:37.501 --> 14:39.503
You ladies discuss responsibility
while I get stoned

14:39.587 --> 14:40.921
and play video games with your kids.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.766
-Fuck! More forest!
-Look around!

14:56.812 --> 14:57.730
Try heading North?

15:01.609 --> 15:02.901
-Oh shit.
-Wait, what the fuck.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.778
Maybe keep heading North?

15:10.993 --> 15:13.954
-What the hell?!
-God, what happens in the shadows?

15:14.038 --> 15:14.997
Jerry, sweetie?

15:15.080 --> 15:18.709
-If you can hear me, please, unroll.
-He doesn’t want to.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.794
It’s a little late to worry
about what he wants.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.006
Jesus, Beth, don’t fall for this.
This isn’t love, it’s a tantrum.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.968
Yeah but his tantrum is self destructive.
Yours is destructive.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.471
Maybe that’s why I’m the one
that loves him. He worries.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.057
He wants to do right.
He’s ashamed when he fails.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.476
Aren’t those things you love about me?

15:35.559 --> 15:39.146
You want me to be like him? You want
me to propose? Threaten to kill myself?

15:39.229 --> 15:43.150
No. I love you the way you are.
And I did it forever in a video game.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.486
But in life, things go wrong.
Things stop working.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.489
I like to fix those things,
and when I can’t, I’m pretty useless.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.783
-Like my husband.
-I don’t get it.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.826
You’re the house wife and
I’m the space lady

15:52.910 --> 15:54.995
but you’re the one that chewed me up
and spit me out.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.830
I don’t want to just forget about you.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.376
Me neither. It’s a problem.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.420
But we know someone
that owes us a solution.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.007
Shit, we’re out of the forest!
We found a clearing!

16:07.091 --> 16:08.842
Go check it out!
Go check out the clearing!

16:14.098 --> 16:16.517
Vampires?! Oh, come on!
That’s not realistic!

16:16.600 --> 16:19.186
Morty, it’s obviously set in a world
where vampires hunt in clearings.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.020
How did you...

16:20.104 --> 16:21.897
I’m working with
the same information you are.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.858
No more screen time until
your homework’s done, Dad.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.528
-What did that mean?
-We refuse to care

16:27.861 --> 16:30.030
Damn. You really came of age
this Thanksgiving.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.033
How old are we?
We’ve had a million Thanksgivings.

16:33.117 --> 16:36.912
-Can I explain how irrational this is?
-Asked the guy that cloned his daughter.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.163
Will I ever live that down?

16:38.247 --> 16:38.914
-No
-No

16:38.997 --> 16:40.499
You guys are having
me Eternal Sunshine

16:40.582 --> 16:42.835
all the Multiplicity porn scenes
from your minds?

16:42.918 --> 16:43.961
-Yep. Basically.
-Sounds right.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.964
Meanwhile, everyone around you,
your father, your cuckhold husband,

16:47.047 --> 16:50.175
your jaded children will just happily
and silently bear the burden

16:50.259 --> 16:52.219
because it’s more practical
for them than the truth

16:52.302 --> 16:54.221
and you don’t care becausei
t won’t be your problem.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.890
-Solid repipe, Dad.
-It’s like he has a lifetime of experience

16:56.974 --> 16:57.975
as a selfish ass.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.231
When this fails and the two of you
fall in love again

17:04.606 --> 17:06.066
and you attack me for taking part in this,

17:06.150 --> 17:08.235
I’m gonna lie and say I tried
to talk you out of it for hours.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.236
In truth, I don’t care.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.740
-Three, two...
-For God’s sake, all of you, grow up.

17:12.823 --> 17:13.949
-Jerry! You un rolled!
-What the hell?

17:14.032 --> 17:15.784
Plot twist, Deus Ex Husbanda.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.078
Don’t lobotomize yourselves
for my comfort.

17:18.162 --> 17:21.874
I may be a man but I’m also a baby
and babies don’t take responsibility

17:21.957 --> 17:24.918
for other people’s suffering. I should
never have said I’d kill myself

17:25.002 --> 17:26.253
if you left me. It’s not true.

17:26.837 --> 17:30.090
All I’d do is pack my shit and cry while
I look for a job on Starbuck’s wifi.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.842
And that’s what I’m gonna do.

17:31.925 --> 17:35.763
So the two of you can get
clone lesbian married by a robot

17:35.846 --> 17:38.891
and finger yourselves on the moon while
laughing in Martian French

17:38.974 --> 17:41.935
-about my weird little dick!
-Jerry, wait.

17:47.274 --> 17:51.278
-Jerry, don’t leave angry.
-Should I float out on a lotus leaf?

17:51.361 --> 17:55.032
I have to be twice as confident because
my wife cheated on me with herself?

17:55.115 --> 17:57.910
-It’s not even cheating.
-You here to help? You suck.

17:57.993 --> 17:59.995
You don’t even know
which one is your real wife.

18:00.078 --> 18:02.122
If it’s me, have you been
cheating with a clone?

18:02.206 --> 18:03.791
I’m not the clone but she has a point.

18:03.874 --> 18:07.294
what a provocative conversation
it would’ve been great to have before

18:07.377 --> 18:09.963
the two of you, and I am counting two,

18:10.047 --> 18:14.134
gave each other unfairly expert orgasms
while mocking my weird little dick!

18:14.218 --> 18:16.720
Jerry, you’re the only one
who keeps saying weird and little.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.972
Well you’ve both seen it!
And you’ve both seen each other

18:19.056 --> 18:21.308
and now you want to tell me
all about it but it’s a little late.

18:21.850 --> 18:25.938
My God. You’re not mad that it was
about you. You’re mad that it wasn’t.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.065
He wanted to permit our love.

18:28.148 --> 18:31.026
Okay it’s not "Handmaid’s Tale"
to loop in your husband.

18:31.109 --> 18:32.986
I agree for the record, we made a mistake.

18:33.070 --> 18:37.324
because we should’ve noticed ourselves
losing control and gone to Sexmaster Jerry

18:37.407 --> 18:40.911
and said oh pretty please,
Jerry, can I make out with myself?

18:40.994 --> 18:41.954
Yes you may.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.958
See. Not so hot when it’s
above board. Homewreckers.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.336
-So we won’t enjoy this?
-Well hold on hold on, this is weird.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.004
Weird and permitted.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.173
-Wait, you like this?
-Who cares what he likes.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.008
-I do.
-I might like it

18:55.092 --> 18:58.011
-and if she likes it I permit it.
-You little pervert.

18:58.095 --> 19:01.139
-You like a little pervert.
-I like humiliating a little pervert.

19:01.223 --> 19:05.185
-I approve. Carry on.
-I’m freaked out by how hot this is.

19:05.269 --> 19:08.313
-Am I permitted to do this?
-Until further notice.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.899
-I love it.
-Then it’s permitted from now on.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.319
Because you like whatever she likes.
Because you’re a worm.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.029
I will allow that assessment.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.782
-Pass the salt?
-Dammit.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.201
-I allow this.
-Well then it’s required.

19:21.285 --> 19:22.870
I approve the requirement.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.329
-You get over there.
-Good idea

19:24.413 --> 19:27.833
-Okay. Honey?
-I’m fine if you are.

19:27.916 --> 19:31.336
-You’re never fine, shut up.
-Okay but... Okay.

19:31.962 --> 19:35.048
-This is not how I pictured this but...
-I have zero complaints so far.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.926
-Because I know what you want.
-I do not disagree with that.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.221
-Can I make a pitch? What if we...
-Are you serious?

19:41.305 --> 19:44.182
-Is this making fun of me?
-Well is that bad?

19:44.266 --> 19:45.225
I’ll allow it.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.814
Jesus Christ, you need to fix
the portal gun, Rick.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.941
Morty, you asking makes me
wanna do it less.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.944
Okay, Thanksgiving!
Let’s talk about Thanksgiving!

19:56.028 --> 19:58.363
Who’s thankful for what?
Go, Summer, you first.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.993
I guess I’m thankful, for like, water?

20:03.076 --> 20:04.912
Perfect! Wonderful! Morty, what about you?

20:04.995 --> 20:08.290
Fucking. Are you fucking
kidding me? Why? Why?

20:08.373 --> 20:11.168
Discovery Channel!
Discovery Channel, why?!

20:11.501 --> 20:14.963
Okay. Just, eat your food.
Everyone eat the food.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.089
Sorry, I'm... this...

20:18.050 --> 20:21.303
Well, bye kids! I’ll keep an eye
out for my grandkid in space.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.389
Your what? Oh! Right. Naruto.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.266
Thanks for visiting, Space Beth.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.983
Well, seems like we all learned
a little lesson this weekend!

20:35.067 --> 20:38.195
-At least, I know I did!
-Me too, Jerry. Me too.

21:21.905 --> 21:24.825
Hello there, Jerry!
How can I help you today?

21:24.908 --> 21:28.036
Howdy! Just, just here to hang!

21:28.120 --> 21:31.373
I’m sorry, sweetie.
You can’t come here by yourself.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.291
Why not? It’s just me in there!

21:33.375 --> 21:38.171
Well, not that this is something you’d do,
but sometimes we have Jerries come here

21:38.255 --> 21:40.382
and try to touch other Jerries.

21:40.465 --> 21:44.344
No, that’s, that’s not good.
Well, see you later!

21:51.476 --> 21:52.394
-Okay.
-Thank you!
