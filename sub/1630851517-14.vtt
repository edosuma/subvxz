00:01.349 --> 00:02.436
ADULT SHELDON:
Scientific rivalries

00:02.480 --> 00:03.915
are a fact of life.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.354
When two competing scientists
work on a project,

00:06.397 --> 00:09.573
it can devolve into
an intellectual boxing match.

00:09.618 --> 00:12.272
Over the years, there's been
a few classic heavyweight bouts.

00:12.316 --> 00:14.404
Newton and Leibniz.[bell ringing]

00:14.448 --> 00:15.884
Tesla and Edison.

00:15.928 --> 00:19.280
And in a lesser-known
but equally brutal bout...

00:19.323 --> 00:21.803
ANNOUNCER:
Linkletter versus Sturgis,

00:21.847 --> 00:24.067
The Tussle with No Muscle.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.591
Let's see how they stack up

00:26.635 --> 00:28.289
in a tale of the tape.

00:28.332 --> 00:32.597
In the wire frame glasses,
the Eureka from Topeka,

00:32.640 --> 00:34.947
Grant Linkletter.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.603
IQ: 159.

00:38.646 --> 00:40.996
Papers published: 272.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.304
Bedtime: 8:30.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.609
And his opponent,

00:45.654 --> 00:47.872
in his favorite sensible shoes,

00:47.917 --> 00:50.398
The Brain from Maine,

00:50.441 --> 00:54.357
John Burgess Sturgis!

00:54.402 --> 00:57.448
IQ: 162.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.060
Papers published: 221.

01:00.103 --> 01:02.670
Bedtime: 7:45 on weekdays,

01:02.713 --> 01:05.281
9:00 on Saturday night.

01:05.325 --> 01:09.981
Fasten your thinking caps
and let's get it on.

01:10.025 --> 01:12.593
The free-streaming length
of the axion is too long.

01:12.637 --> 01:14.986
It'll erase the fluctuations.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.293
You're completely forgetting

01:16.337 --> 01:18.426
that it is nonrelativistic
dark matter.

01:18.468 --> 01:19.992
You'll never have the resolution

01:20.036 --> 01:21.864
to see microkelvin features.

01:21.906 --> 01:24.605
I think your brain is as smooth
as the top of your head.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.433
Low blow, Grant.

01:26.477 --> 01:28.870
He's right, gentlemen,
let's keep it to science.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.700
You'll never have the resolution

01:31.742 --> 01:33.701
to see microkelvin features.

01:33.745 --> 01:36.661
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:36.704 --> 01:39.533
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

01:39.576 --> 01:42.014
♪ I bet I could be your hero

01:42.057 --> 01:44.495
♪ I am a mighty little man

01:44.539 --> 01:48.716
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

01:54.418 --> 01:58.727
I cannot work with that creepy
little know-it-all one more day.

01:58.770 --> 02:01.947
I-I'm sorry, but are we talking
about Sheldon or Sturgis?

02:01.990 --> 02:05.560
Sturgis.
Well, both, but mostly Sturgis.

02:05.602 --> 02:08.431
He's not interested
in anyone else's input.

02:08.475 --> 02:10.564
I-I'm sorry,
Sheldon or Linkletter?

02:10.608 --> 02:11.566
Linkletter.

02:11.609 --> 02:13.872
Ah, got it. Continue.

02:13.915 --> 02:14.872
Well?

02:14.917 --> 02:16.265
But I thought you wanted

02:16.310 --> 02:18.354
Dr. Sturgis on this project.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.662
I'll admit John
has been useful, but now

02:20.704 --> 02:22.359
he's just slowing us down.

02:22.402 --> 02:24.405
Well, he keeps Sheldon happy,

02:24.448 --> 02:27.058
and when Sheldon's happy,
he's not in this office.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.713
Well, but when he's not in
your office, he's in my office.

02:29.758 --> 02:31.847
Eh, "dem's da breaks."
[chuckles]

02:31.889 --> 02:33.543
I was brought in to help

02:33.587 --> 02:36.372
but Dr. Linkletter
doesn't value my input.

02:36.417 --> 02:39.376
Oh, I hear you.
That must be tough.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.901
Ever since he was brought back,
he contradicts everything I say.

02:42.944 --> 02:45.860
I hear you. That must be tough.

02:45.903 --> 02:47.384
There was a time when
their arguing brought out

02:47.427 --> 02:49.865
the best in them, but now
it's just hindering our work.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.997
I hear you. That must be tough.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.477
Thank you for understanding.

02:53.521 --> 02:55.740
And between us,

02:55.783 --> 02:58.787
I am counting on you
being in charge.

02:58.829 --> 03:00.049
Excellent.

03:00.092 --> 03:02.530
You're the alpha dog
on this project.

03:02.573 --> 03:03.878
Very good.

03:03.921 --> 03:06.402
But shouldn't we tell everyone?

03:06.447 --> 03:09.580
Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't
be seen as playing favorites.

03:09.623 --> 03:13.454
But what's important
is that I know and you know.

03:13.497 --> 03:14.455
Smart.

03:14.497 --> 03:15.586
But not as smart as you.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.240
Oh. [laughs]

03:17.283 --> 03:20.373
Which is why, uh,
just between us,

03:20.417 --> 03:24.028
I am counting on you to keep
the train on the tracks.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.901
Well, I appreciate
the vote of confidence.

03:25.943 --> 03:28.033
And the sweet train metaphor.Well, good.

03:28.076 --> 03:29.948
You know, I just
want you to be happy.

03:29.991 --> 03:32.603
I guess in a way I'm kind
of like the son you never had.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.257
Sure.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.389
Which is nice,
because you're far too old

03:35.432 --> 03:36.694
to have children now.

03:36.737 --> 03:38.086
[laughs softly]

03:38.129 --> 03:40.002
And you make me feel okay
about that.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.611
Wait.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.834
$20 on pump four, please.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.704
You got it.

03:48.750 --> 03:49.881
Here you go.

03:51.491 --> 03:52.449
What's this?

03:52.492 --> 03:53.972
Promotion for the new lottery.

03:54.015 --> 03:55.973
Every ten gallons,
you get a free scratcher.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.975
Oh, I don't believe in gambling.

03:58.020 --> 03:59.063
Great, I'll take it.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.109
Oh, I don't believe

04:00.151 --> 04:01.414
you should be gambling, either.

04:01.457 --> 04:02.545
So, you don't want it?

04:02.590 --> 04:04.373
No.Then I'm scratching it.

04:04.418 --> 04:06.723
Sorry. Not on my watch.

04:07.985 --> 04:09.813
You can thank me in heaven.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.602
[stammers]

04:14.645 --> 04:16.298
What's this formula?

04:16.343 --> 04:17.952
This wasn't here yesterday.

04:17.995 --> 04:20.302
Dr. Linkletter added it
after you left.

04:20.346 --> 04:21.956
Was he trying to be funny?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.654
He was giggling
at your "feebleminded math."

04:24.699 --> 04:25.656
His words.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.961
He's trying to approximate

04:27.004 --> 04:30.312
the cosmic background radiation
by setting it

04:30.356 --> 04:35.622
at one Rydberg over Z,
and mymath is feebleminded?

04:35.665 --> 04:37.581
[laughs]

04:38.625 --> 04:39.887
What do you think you're doing?

04:39.930 --> 04:42.543
I'm changing the estimate

04:42.586 --> 04:45.632
to Robert Dicke's value
of 45 kelvin.

04:45.675 --> 04:48.331
I wasn't here the last time
he went off his rocker.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.723
Is this what it looked like?

04:49.766 --> 04:52.334
I'm perfectly sane,
and I'm telling you,

04:52.379 --> 04:54.858
Dicke's estimate
is the way to go.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.338
And I'm telling you
we need to use

04:56.382 --> 04:58.776
one Rydberg over Z,
and that is final.

04:58.819 --> 05:02.432
Oh, is it, you albino beanpole?

05:02.475 --> 05:03.519
Dr. Sturgis.

05:03.564 --> 05:06.523
He impugned my mental stability.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.959
Fair enough. Your insult stands.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.440
Thank you. Beanpole.

05:25.411 --> 05:26.586
Ooh.

05:28.588 --> 05:29.677
Oh, man.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.678
God, I swear I'll never ask

05:31.721 --> 05:34.290
for anything again,
just one more 500.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.899
Thank you.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.946
Melissa Cooper,
what are you doing with that?

05:37.988 --> 05:39.468
I found it.

05:39.512 --> 05:42.558
Well, it is mine, and
I threw it away for a reason.

05:42.603 --> 05:45.432
It's mine now,
and I might win 500 bucks.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.476
Oh, no, you won't.

05:47.521 --> 05:48.913
I'll split it with you.No.

05:48.956 --> 05:50.567
Why are you being so lame?

05:50.610 --> 05:52.569
Because money
does not buy happiness.

05:52.612 --> 05:55.832
[sighs]
Fresh Prince seems pretty happy.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.879
It is not his money,
it's his Uncle Phil's!

05:59.923 --> 06:01.577
[sighs]

06:13.459 --> 06:14.809
[exhales]

06:19.596 --> 06:20.641
[gasps]

06:20.684 --> 06:22.773
Half of that's mine.
I prayed for it.

06:22.817 --> 06:23.992
Go to your room.

06:26.036 --> 06:28.518
You're wasting valuable time.

06:28.562 --> 06:29.779
I'm not, you are.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.042
Gentlemen,
if we could please keep

06:31.086 --> 06:32.521
this train on the tracks...

06:32.566 --> 06:33.957
We'll be on track
if we follow my plan,

06:34.002 --> 06:35.872
so I'm afraid I'm going
to have to insist.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.004
Insist?

06:37.048 --> 06:38.963
You're not the alpha dog
around here.

06:39.007 --> 06:39.963
I agree.

06:40.007 --> 06:41.487
This may be hard for both of you

06:41.531 --> 06:44.752
to hear, but President Hagemeyer
put me in charge.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.927
I know for a fact
that isn't true,

06:46.971 --> 06:49.495
because she put me in charge.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.411
We may have a problem.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.500
What can I say?

06:54.543 --> 06:56.024
I tried something.
[laughs softly]

07:01.115 --> 07:02.290
So you really thought

07:02.334 --> 07:03.204
you could tell us
we were all in charge

07:03.247 --> 07:04.379
and we wouldn't
figure it out?

07:04.423 --> 07:07.470
Well, in my defense,
I said to each of you,

07:07.514 --> 07:09.471
"Let's keep this
between us."

07:09.516 --> 07:12.779
I'm a little disappointed
that you broke my trust.

07:12.822 --> 07:15.478
That is true. We're sorry.

07:15.521 --> 07:18.088
Don't apologize for that.
We were being manipulated.

07:18.132 --> 07:19.481
You were the one
who blabbed first.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.483
That's because you kept
slowing us down

07:21.528 --> 07:22.790
with your outmoded ideas.

07:22.832 --> 07:24.834
Gentlemen, if we could
just follow my plan...

07:24.879 --> 07:26.184
No.
No.

07:26.228 --> 07:27.795
Well, I hope
that you're starting

07:27.838 --> 07:31.319
to see the challenge I faced
putting any of you in charge.

07:31.362 --> 07:32.408
You're right, we're sorry.

07:32.451 --> 07:34.497
Stop that.Sorry.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.846
Well, we can't move forward

07:35.889 --> 07:37.848
until a project leader
is chosen.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.502
He's right, I'll do it.

07:39.545 --> 07:41.329
You're a child. You'rea child.

07:41.372 --> 07:42.504
Oh, you're all children.

07:42.548 --> 07:44.420
Sorry. Sorry.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.596
Well, who's it gonna be?

07:47.641 --> 07:49.598
Gentlemen, I'm Dr. Carol Lee,

07:49.643 --> 07:52.733
director of the new
experimental cosmology center.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.343
What makes you qualified
to lead our project?

07:55.387 --> 07:56.867
Yeah.Yeah.

07:56.911 --> 08:00.348
Well, I have a PhD in physics
from Berkeley,

08:00.391 --> 08:02.569
I worked at IBM's
Watson Research Center

08:02.612 --> 08:04.526
as lead of the materials
research group,

08:04.571 --> 08:06.615
and I raised
three little boys,

08:06.660 --> 08:08.182
which I understand

08:08.225 --> 08:09.879
you've been acting like.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.579
Sounds like she can handle it.

08:13.622 --> 08:15.581
Dear Lord, please forgive me.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.365
I shouldn't have
finished that scratcher.

08:17.408 --> 08:19.194
That was wrong.

08:19.237 --> 08:24.547
But now that I have the money,
my family could really use it.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.331
I know. Gambling is a sin.

08:27.375 --> 08:30.334
Although, I didn't buy
the scratcher,

08:30.379 --> 08:32.554
so is that even gambling?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.557
Why is Missy saying we're rich?

08:35.950 --> 08:39.909
I suggest we mount a radio
telescope on the roof

08:39.953 --> 08:41.563
so that we can get a good read

08:41.607 --> 08:43.610
on the fluctuations
in radiation.

08:43.653 --> 08:45.088
Excellent.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.875
We'll pick a small region
of the sky and drill down.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.876
Whoa, whoa, pump your brakes.

08:49.919 --> 08:52.749
We need at least
a 45-square-degree sector

08:52.793 --> 08:55.796
of the sky in order to take
any meaningful readings.

08:55.838 --> 08:57.537
That's ridiculous.
What we need to do is cut

08:57.580 --> 08:59.799
a single linear section
across the horizon.

08:59.842 --> 09:02.192
No, if we don't focus,
we won't get any useful data.

09:02.236 --> 09:03.673
I suggest 20
arc minutes max.

09:03.716 --> 09:06.283
The trick is to pick
a good spot.

09:06.327 --> 09:09.461
You want a trick?
Go see David Copperfield.

09:09.504 --> 09:10.592
How about I make youdisappear?

09:11.855 --> 09:13.509
Do I need to separate you?

09:13.552 --> 09:17.513
Or can we try to put
our minds together

09:17.557 --> 09:20.168
for the advancement of science?

09:20.211 --> 09:22.474
The second one.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.912
I know you're new here, ma'am,
but this is our process.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.826
They argue, I swoop in
and save the day.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.871
It may seem unorthodox
to you, however...

09:30.874 --> 09:32.484
The-the second one.

09:33.834 --> 09:36.313
I'm gonna tell you right now,
we can't keep it.

09:36.357 --> 09:39.447
It's not a puppy, Mary,
it's 500 bucks.

09:39.490 --> 09:40.841
It is gambling.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.538
Then why'd you buy the ticket?

09:42.581 --> 09:45.496
I didn't buy it. They gave it
to me at the gas station.

09:45.540 --> 09:48.892
Okay, well, that sounds
like a gift from God.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.371
You don't want to make Him mad.

09:50.414 --> 09:52.634
That is not how God
works, George.

09:52.678 --> 09:55.245
What if he wanted you to have it
to give to the Church?

09:55.289 --> 09:56.856
Well...

09:56.899 --> 09:59.336
Well, uh, based on that,
what if he wanted you to have it

09:59.380 --> 10:01.470
so we could buy stuff?George.

10:01.513 --> 10:04.298
All I'm saying is, we work hard,
we're good people.

10:04.341 --> 10:05.822
Maybe we deserve this.

10:09.433 --> 10:11.480
I guess a dishwasher
might be nice.

10:11.523 --> 10:13.655
There you go. Get a dishwasher.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.745
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

10:15.788 --> 10:18.529
What's to think about?
Have some fun for once.

10:18.573 --> 10:20.489
Ooh, we getting something
fun with the money?

10:20.532 --> 10:21.881
We're talking about
a dishwasher.

10:21.924 --> 10:23.971
When did your dreams die?

10:25.014 --> 10:26.886
When we had kids.George.

10:26.929 --> 10:31.239
I was carrying pulsers
75 feet up

10:31.282 --> 10:33.240
a wet metal ladder

10:33.283 --> 10:34.590
when there was an earthquake.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.548
[chuckles] So, I am hanging on
for dear life...

10:37.592 --> 10:40.290
Ooh, we should set up
several radio telescopes

10:40.335 --> 10:42.597
on different rooftops
in an array.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.211
You speak Mandarin.

10:56.524 --> 10:58.875
I heard my name.
What are they saying?

10:58.918 --> 11:01.138
I don't speak Mandarin.
Just a little French.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.923
Oh, really?

11:06.621 --> 11:07.623
Ha!

11:10.147 --> 11:11.845
[laughter]

11:11.888 --> 11:14.107
Well, does anyone here
speak Klingon?

11:24.466 --> 11:26.380
Dr. Lee?Sheldon.

11:26.423 --> 11:28.164
May I have a moment
of your time?

11:28.208 --> 11:30.124
Of course, come in.

11:30.167 --> 11:31.865
Sit.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.128
How can I help you?

11:34.171 --> 11:37.434
I feel like my contributions
aren't being taken seriously.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.611
Oh, well, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

11:40.655 --> 11:43.528
but I'm listening
to everyone's contributions.

11:43.572 --> 11:45.399
But you're not taking
any of mine.

11:45.442 --> 11:48.316
No. But Drs. Linkletter
and Sturgis

11:48.359 --> 11:50.578
seem happy with the
direction we're headed.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.190
Well, I think it's because

11:53.234 --> 11:56.149
you're using
your feminine wiles.

11:56.192 --> 11:58.847
And what exactly
do you think that means?

11:58.892 --> 12:00.544
I'm not sure,
but you are wearing lip gloss

12:00.589 --> 12:02.808
and seem to have good hygiene.

12:02.851 --> 12:04.985
And if you're trying to use them
on me, it's not going to work.

12:06.115 --> 12:08.466
Sheldon, I assure you

12:08.509 --> 12:09.336
that I'm just trying to do

12:09.379 --> 12:10.554
what's best for the project.

12:10.599 --> 12:12.383
Excellent,
then you'll want to set up

12:12.427 --> 12:14.168
several telescopes in an array.

12:14.211 --> 12:17.171
I hear you, but... ghobe'.

12:17.213 --> 12:20.434
Wait, that's "no" in Klingon.
Do you speak Klingon?

12:20.477 --> 12:21.914
I looked up that one word.

12:21.957 --> 12:24.918
I had a feeling it
would come in handy.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.919
[grunts]

12:29.356 --> 12:32.360
Ooh, look
at the Ultra-Clean Two.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.404
It's got five washing cycles.

12:34.448 --> 12:37.234
I don't know, George,
these are really expensive.

12:37.278 --> 12:40.498
You won the money.
Spend it.

12:40.542 --> 12:43.587
Maybe we should just
get a more affordable one.

12:43.631 --> 12:47.331
Everything we do is affordable.
Uh... splurge for once.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.072
It's so extravagant.

12:49.115 --> 12:50.290
[laughs] You'd think
we were talking about

12:50.334 --> 12:51.422
buying a party boat.

12:51.466 --> 12:53.990
It's a dishwasher,
for crying out loud.

12:54.033 --> 12:57.601
But the way we got the money,
it just doesn't feel right.

12:57.645 --> 13:00.082
So you're telling me
you're never okay

13:00.126 --> 13:01.868
with bending the rules
once in a while?

13:01.910 --> 13:04.173
That's not how being
a Christian works.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.221
Good to know.

13:08.961 --> 13:10.049
What are you doing?

13:10.092 --> 13:12.182
Oh, just helping you
be a good Christian.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.360
[door closes]

13:16.403 --> 13:18.405
ADULT SHELDON:
Dr. Lee had commandeered
the project,

13:18.448 --> 13:21.104
and Drs. Linkletter
and Sturgis were okay with it.

13:21.148 --> 13:24.629
Everyone was being mean,
and I was out of my depth.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.327
I needed advice
on how to proceed.

13:27.370 --> 13:29.286
Thankfully, I was mere feet away

13:29.330 --> 13:31.027
from the person
who had been mean to me

13:31.071 --> 13:33.595
since she tried strangling me
with her umbilical cord.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.292
What?

13:35.336 --> 13:37.903
So, this Dr. Lee is turning
your friends against you?

13:37.947 --> 13:39.209
Essentially.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.644
Classic move.

13:40.688 --> 13:42.255
Most girls you find crying
in the school bathroom,

13:42.298 --> 13:43.386
that was it.

13:43.431 --> 13:44.649
What do I do?

13:44.692 --> 13:46.086
Well, you're in a tough spot

13:46.129 --> 13:48.349
'cause your personality is ugh.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.177
There's enough people
being mean to me right now.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.177
Sorry.

13:51.221 --> 13:52.527
Can you help me or not?

13:52.570 --> 13:54.963
It's you against a bunch
of college professors.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.530
I don't think
you can win this one.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.404
Oh. Do any of them have pimples?

14:01.448 --> 14:02.971
No.

14:03.015 --> 14:05.452
Too bad, I've done a lot
of damage with "pizza face."

14:07.455 --> 14:09.152
He just took the ticket

14:09.196 --> 14:10.587
and stormed off.

14:10.631 --> 14:13.155
I don't know why he cares
so much about a dishwasher.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.897
Maybe it ain't
about the dishwasher.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.899
Well, what is it, then?

14:16.942 --> 14:18.988
Mary, I love you,
but sometimes it's kind of like

14:19.032 --> 14:21.511
you're waging a war on fun.

14:21.556 --> 14:24.907
Why? Because I have values?

14:24.951 --> 14:27.213
Well, too bad because
they're not going away.

14:27.256 --> 14:29.650
Oh, and fun is down
for the count.

14:29.693 --> 14:31.913
500 bucks?

14:31.957 --> 14:34.003
I guess drinks are on you.

14:34.047 --> 14:37.311
Fine, but is that all
you got from my story?

14:37.354 --> 14:39.355
It's called lightening
the mood, George.

14:39.399 --> 14:41.315
Sorry.

14:41.357 --> 14:43.664
But I do think
you're overreacting.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.407
Come on.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.975
I... Would it kill her
to loosen up once in a while?

14:49.018 --> 14:51.193
Maybe that's just
not who she is.

14:51.238 --> 14:54.676
What if it is, just not with me?

14:54.719 --> 14:56.068
Well, what does that mean?

14:57.244 --> 14:58.941
The other night I
drove by the church

14:58.985 --> 15:01.029
and I saw Mary
and that new youth pastor

15:01.073 --> 15:04.554
just hanging out on the curb,
laughing and smoking cigarettes.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.384
Yeah? And?

15:08.428 --> 15:09.908
Well, that's not enough?

15:09.951 --> 15:12.172
Well, is smoking even a sin?

15:12.215 --> 15:14.609
'Cause I still light up
after a roll in the hay.

15:14.652 --> 15:19.395
The point is, she's capable
of being fun, just...

15:19.440 --> 15:21.181
not with me.

15:21.224 --> 15:23.356
It's not like
I don't want to be fun,

15:23.399 --> 15:24.706
but I feel like

15:24.749 --> 15:27.230
I am the only one holding
the family together.

15:27.274 --> 15:30.232
Mary, can I point out that you
weren't exactly like this

15:30.277 --> 15:32.061
when y'all got married?

15:32.105 --> 15:34.062
So? I'm not allowed to grow?

15:34.106 --> 15:36.630
Apart? Okay.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.287
What made you and your wife
call it quits?

15:40.330 --> 15:41.941
George, let me
tell you something.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.942
Getting divorced sucks.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.249
I know.You don't.

15:46.293 --> 15:49.034
If you think you're upset
about a $500 scratcher,

15:49.077 --> 15:52.211
try sitting home alone
with half your money gone.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.431
I thought you were
gonna say something

15:54.475 --> 15:55.605
about love and vows.

15:55.649 --> 15:57.390
Half, George.

15:57.433 --> 15:59.261
And it wasn't a lot
when it was a whole.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.177
I said I'd buy your drinks.

16:01.221 --> 16:02.482
Well, thank you.

16:03.484 --> 16:04.919
Wings wouldn't hurt, either.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.182
ADULT SHELDON:
My sister thought I was in

16:06.225 --> 16:07.488
an unwinnable situation,

16:07.530 --> 16:09.272
but I knew someone else
who faced

16:09.316 --> 16:13.145
a no-win scenario and prevailed:
one James Tiberius Kirk.

16:13.188 --> 16:15.625
The Kobayashi Maru
was a simulation

16:15.669 --> 16:18.455
designed to be unbeatable,
but Kirk snuck in

16:18.499 --> 16:20.326
and reprogrammed it
so he could win.

16:20.370 --> 16:23.155
All I needed to do
was put my scanning coordinates

16:23.198 --> 16:26.462
into Dr. Lee's radio telescope
to prove I was correct.

16:26.506 --> 16:29.336
It was time for my sneaky face.

16:31.076 --> 16:32.513
[door closes]

16:35.124 --> 16:36.211
Hey.

16:36.255 --> 16:37.648
Hi.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.433
This is yours.

16:40.476 --> 16:42.392
And if you don't feel
right spending it,

16:42.436 --> 16:44.567
then you should do
whatever you want with it.

16:44.611 --> 16:46.657
Thank you.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.013
You know,
I've been thinking that

16:54.056 --> 16:55.448
maybe it isn't

16:55.491 --> 16:58.581
the end of the world
if we spend it on something fun.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.149
Really?

17:00.192 --> 17:03.109
Yeah, something
the family could enjoy.

17:03.152 --> 17:04.980
Well...

17:05.023 --> 17:06.502
we haven't been on vacation
in a long time.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.375
Oh...

17:08.417 --> 17:10.028
Oh.
[gasps]

17:10.071 --> 17:12.161
We could go to Houston,
see the Ice Capades.

17:13.336 --> 17:14.597
Let's keep thinking.

17:16.425 --> 17:19.864
ADULT SHELDON:
The next evening,
I put my plan into action.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.518
I was just like Captain Kirk,

17:21.561 --> 17:24.433
if Captain Kirk had to bum
a ride from his meemaw.

17:24.478 --> 17:27.133
All I needed to do was
get into Dr. Lee's office

17:27.175 --> 17:29.221
and swap the coordinates.

17:29.265 --> 17:30.396
Nothing could stop me.

17:32.050 --> 17:34.530
Dang it.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.619
Well, here's to male egos

17:36.663 --> 17:38.317
and all the fun
that comes with them.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.580
[chuckles][sighs]

17:40.624 --> 17:42.799
You've had to deal
with that a lot, huh?

17:42.844 --> 17:44.801
The first month I was here,
people kept assuming

17:44.846 --> 17:46.847
I was the president's secretary.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.849
Did you correct them?

17:48.893 --> 17:51.808
No, I just told them
that the president was too busy

17:51.853 --> 17:54.247
to see them and then
I cut their funding.

17:54.289 --> 17:56.596
[laughs]
That must have felt good.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.903
Ah, it was like taking off
my bra at the end of a long day.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.516
Mm-hmm.But I don't have to tell you.

18:02.558 --> 18:06.214
Can you believe there were only
three women in my major?

18:06.259 --> 18:07.868
Oh, at least you had each other.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.784
Those bitches? Pass.

18:09.826 --> 18:11.612
What about the guys?

18:11.654 --> 18:13.353
Either too scared to talk to me

18:13.395 --> 18:15.484
or trying to talk me
into being horizontal.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.704
Oh, yeah, I hear that. Mm-hmm.Mm.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.837
I've even had projects sabotaged
just to make me look bad.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.752
You're kidding.Nope.

18:37.768 --> 18:38.900
Well, what did you do?

18:38.942 --> 18:40.815
Well, eventually I realized,

18:40.857 --> 18:43.425
[chuckles]:
I'm an experimental physicist.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.820
I can build anything I want
to protect my work.

18:46.864 --> 18:49.432
[alarm sounding]

18:51.304 --> 18:52.653
[coughs]

18:52.695 --> 18:54.654
And thanks to my kids,

18:54.698 --> 18:58.659
I am very familiar with
the movie Home Alone.

18:58.701 --> 19:01.227
[both laugh]

19:01.269 --> 19:03.707
ADULT SHELDON:
After a lot of apologizing,
a little begging

19:03.750 --> 19:05.361
and a note from my mother,

19:05.404 --> 19:08.277
I was allowed to keep
my role on the team.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.973
When Captain Kirk
faced the no-win scenario,

19:10.018 --> 19:11.759
he didn't have blue
and yellow snot for a week.

19:11.801 --> 19:13.630
[sneezes]Ew.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.636
[low humming]

19:20.681 --> 19:22.335
Sounds like the ocean.

19:22.377 --> 19:23.465
Oh, it is very relaxing.

19:23.509 --> 19:24.641
GEORGE JR.:
Kind of makes

19:24.684 --> 19:26.773
the rest of the kitchen
look trashy.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.950
Ooh, it has
a temperature boost sensor.

19:28.992 --> 19:30.256
What's that?

19:30.298 --> 19:31.778
It makes sure
the water is heated

19:31.821 --> 19:33.606
to the correct temperature
for ideal cleaning

19:33.650 --> 19:35.608
and drying results.ALL:
Ooh.

19:35.652 --> 19:36.871
[scoffs]

19:36.913 --> 19:38.001
Where are you going?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.742
You're gonna miss
the rinse cycle.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.222
I'm not missing anything.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.876
[dishwasher beeps]

19:42.920 --> 19:44.443
Oh, it beeped. Look up "beep."
