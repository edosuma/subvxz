00:36.955 --> 00:39.041
Swords! Yeah, swords!

00:39.580 --> 00:41.595
Oh, men and their swords...

00:41.721 --> 00:45.010
You boys, stop horsing
around with my apples!

00:45.049 --> 00:46.994
Aw, Tree Trunks!

00:46.994 --> 00:48.479
Now, come on over!

00:48.487 --> 00:50.807
I baked y'all an apple pie.

00:52.026 --> 00:53.128
Yeah, apple pie!

00:53.143 --> 00:55.503
I'm gonna eat it all before
you even <i>get</i> there!

01:00.263 --> 01:01.185
Apple pie!

01:01.201 --> 01:02.576
Don't let him eat it all!

01:03.458 --> 01:06.154
Now, you boys sit down
and behave yourselves.

01:06.303 --> 01:06.920
OH!

01:07.685 --> 01:10.076
Shoo, fly! Get off my apple pie!

01:10.646 --> 01:14.576
A fly landed on my pie.
That's no good.

01:15.099 --> 01:16.356
Bye, pie!

01:16.411 --> 01:18.013
Why are you throwing the pie away?

01:19.864 --> 01:21.622
Flies wanted it?

01:21.638 --> 01:23.653
They can have it.

01:23.724 --> 01:25.911
Anyways, don't y'all worry

01:25.937 --> 01:29.444
'cause the new pie is coming
in the wag of a lamb's tail.

01:29.591 --> 01:30.826
New pie?

01:31.896 --> 01:32.911
Pie, yeah!

01:33.294 --> 01:34.396
Here you are.

01:35.568 --> 01:36.833
Come on, go ahead.

01:41.274 --> 01:42.586
What you think?

01:42.632 --> 01:44.828
Best apple pie ever!

01:44.860 --> 01:46.164
Oh, Jake...

01:46.180 --> 01:49.578
Thank you, but that
ain't the <i>best</i> apple pie.

01:49.719 --> 01:51.695
What are you talking 'bout,
Tree Trunks?

01:51.711 --> 01:53.626
What can be better than your apple pie?

01:53.672 --> 01:55.007
You ate all the pie...

01:55.054 --> 01:58.399
Finn, what would you do
if you could do anything?

01:58.515 --> 01:59.429
Anything?

01:59.483 --> 02:02.374
Well, I'd catch a shooting star,
travel to outer space

02:02.400 --> 02:04.212
and fight space monsters!

02:04.298 --> 02:06.447
I'd carve my face on the moon...

02:06.486 --> 02:07.345
...so the moon...

02:07.369 --> 02:08.400
...would look like my face!

02:08.423 --> 02:09.713
What would <i>you</i> do, Tree Trunks?

02:09.821 --> 02:12.665
I would go pick an apple.

02:13.321 --> 02:14.032
...lame.

02:14.236 --> 02:16.329
I'm sorry. I mean...

02:16.384 --> 02:18.853
It's just you pick apples every day.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.338
This apple ain't like
the apples that I pick.

02:21.751 --> 02:25.384
They say it's the apple of apples;

02:25.509 --> 02:27.790
rarest kind of all.

02:27.907 --> 02:32.126
Legends call it the Crystal Gem Apple.

02:33.719 --> 02:35.359
That sounds awesome!

02:35.390 --> 02:36.039
Where is it?

02:36.054 --> 02:40.407
I've heard that it grows at the
deepest end of the Evil Dark Forest.

02:41.281 --> 02:43.671
Tree Trunks you <i>gotta</i> go pick that apple!

02:44.429 --> 02:45.898
What? Me?

02:45.929 --> 02:48.812
Oh, no I'm just a cute little elephant.

02:48.851 --> 02:51.398
I'm not cut out for adventuring.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.554
Tree Trunks! This is your dream!

02:53.577 --> 02:55.280
Think about eating that apple...

02:55.374 --> 02:56.827
...with your own...

02:56.843 --> 02:57.827
...mouth!

02:57.905 --> 02:59.062
Or your trunk.

02:59.101 --> 03:01.163
Imagine the flavor.

03:01.195 --> 03:03.085
And your satisfied face.

03:03.132 --> 03:03.945
Really?

03:03.992 --> 03:07.640
You think I can handle
the Scary Dark Forest?

03:07.664 --> 03:08.398
Yeah!

03:08.406 --> 03:09.351
And we'll help you.

03:09.351 --> 03:10.836
We love you, Tree Trunks.

03:10.953 --> 03:12.312
Okay. I'll do it.

03:12.398 --> 03:13.703
Call me...

03:13.734 --> 03:16.367
...Adventurer Tree Trunks.

03:17.624 --> 03:18.780
Tree Trunks!!!

03:20.116 --> 03:23.687
I love being so high up
from the ground!

03:25.179 --> 03:28.538
I can take you even higher
on <i>my</i> shoulders, Tree Trunks.

03:28.569 --> 03:30.617
No, Jake. She has a weak heart.

03:30.764 --> 03:31.897
Oh, yeah...

03:35.436 --> 03:37.327
Why is this ground all squishy?

03:37.663 --> 03:40.202
Whatever it is, I'm liking it.
Oh, yeah!

03:40.202 --> 03:41.334
I wanna try!

03:41.350 --> 03:43.545
Okay! I'm cool with you letting you
do whatever you want.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.217
It's like some cookie dough!

03:49.928 --> 03:51.842
Oh, hello there.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.014
Uhh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that.

03:57.741 --> 03:59.866
Ugh! You're gonna get it,
wall of flesh.

04:01.983 --> 04:03.491
An eye...

04:03.655 --> 04:05.248
...and a mouth!

04:05.389 --> 04:09.920
Well, I think I got the perfect
thing for him or her:

04:10.139 --> 04:11.037
stickers!

04:11.702 --> 04:12.685
Careful, Tree Trunks,

04:12.701 --> 04:13.905
this thing is evil!

04:13.983 --> 04:15.827
Here's a rainbow sticker.

04:16.873 --> 04:19.139
And here's a scratch-and-sniff sticker,

04:19.178 --> 04:20.904
smells just like a pickle.

04:21.232 --> 04:25.396
Oh, and this one
is a holographic unicorn,

04:25.732 --> 04:27.834
but it doesn't have a horn

04:29.349 --> 04:31.364
Oh, now, whatcha doing?

04:32.084 --> 04:33.341
Huh? Tree Trunks!!!

04:41.053 --> 04:43.131
You better stay in that tree, baby.

04:43.342 --> 04:46.467
Tree Trunks were you putting <i>stickers</i>
 on that evil monster?

04:46.663 --> 04:51.420
Yes, I thought it needed some
tender love and affection.

04:51.772 --> 04:55.452
Oh, what a pretty butterfly!

04:56.693 --> 04:57.779
Tree Trunks?

04:58.794 --> 05:03.123
Jake, I just realized that Tree Trunks
is old and bonkers.

05:03.146 --> 05:05.357
We can't take her through
this Evil Dark Forest.

05:05.536 --> 05:08.263
Nah, she'll be fine. Everything's fine.

05:08.286 --> 05:09.216
But the monsters?

05:09.239 --> 05:11.106
It's fine. It's fine!

05:11.130 --> 05:14.278
Are you sure? 'Cause she has zero
adventurer training.

05:14.302 --> 05:16.622
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
It's fine, she'll be fine!

05:16.646 --> 05:18.114
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

05:18.888 --> 05:19.833
Maybe it <i>is</i> fine.

05:20.302 --> 05:21.036
Tree Trunks?

05:21.060 --> 05:21.661
Where'd she go?

05:21.685 --> 05:22.919
Tree Trunks!!!

05:27.669 --> 05:28.951
We gotta find her, Jake!

05:29.255 --> 05:31.309
Where are you, Tree Trunks?

05:31.333 --> 05:33.458
And here's your teacup...

05:33.466 --> 05:36.435
...and here's <i>my</i> teacup.

05:36.763 --> 05:38.357
Tree Trun...Oh!!!

05:39.091 --> 05:40.724
And here's your sandwich.

05:41.387 --> 05:42.638
Oops, you dropped it.

05:42.653 --> 05:44.137
Tree Trunks, run!

05:44.317 --> 05:45.410
Oh, hey, Finn.

05:47.144 --> 05:50.098
Time to call your mamas,
evil sign posts.

05:54.613 --> 05:58.410
Patience, boys.
There's enough tea for everyone.

06:00.644 --> 06:01.449
No!!!

06:01.824 --> 06:03.621
Oh, what a nice hug.

06:04.354 --> 06:05.535
I'm not hugging you...Ugh.

06:05.652 --> 06:06.597
I'm trying to...Ugh!

06:06.644 --> 06:07.753
save your life!

06:08.261 --> 06:09.363
There's too many!!!

06:09.488 --> 06:10.206
Finn?!?

06:18.987 --> 06:19.948
Oh, Finn...

06:20.127 --> 06:23.119
That tea party was crummier
than a big old biscuit.

06:24.979 --> 06:27.448
Tree Trunks, I'm all jacked up
because of you.

06:27.572 --> 06:29.948
Look at my jacked up face!

06:29.979 --> 06:31.385
Are you mad at me?

06:32.127 --> 06:34.057
No, I'm not mad.

06:34.104 --> 06:36.346
You're too super-cute for me
to be mad at you,

06:36.385 --> 06:38.346
and you're a top notch adventurer!

06:38.369 --> 06:43.252
Now, let's go find and eat the heck out
of that crystal gem apple together.

06:46.307 --> 06:47.072
Dang it!

06:47.159 --> 06:49.784
You go fight.
I'll keep Tree Trunks out of trouble.

06:50.166 --> 06:50.861
Awesome!

06:54.471 --> 06:57.971
J-Jake I think Finn is getting
jacked up again.

06:57.995 --> 06:59.698
Yeah, Finn can handle it.

06:59.713 --> 07:00.534
He's 12!

07:00.580 --> 07:03.158
I think I know a way to help him out.

07:03.213 --> 07:05.666
Uhh, you should stay here, Tree Trunks.

07:05.713 --> 07:08.924
But Finn said that
I was a top notch adventurer.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.978
And my adventurer instincts

07:11.009 --> 07:13.902
tell me to seduce that tentacle critter

07:13.931 --> 07:17.189
with my womanly charms
and elephant prowess.

07:17.212 --> 07:18.751
Uhh, no way.

07:26.267 --> 07:27.775
Uh, what are you doing here,
Tree Trunks?

07:28.743 --> 07:32.305
I'm helping you by tempting
this guy with <i>my body</i>.

07:32.666 --> 07:34.236
It's not a <i>guy</i>, Tree Trunks!

07:34.267 --> 07:36.674
It's a Snake Armed Ruby Brain Beast!

07:36.790 --> 07:39.501
Even brain beasts get lonely, Finn!

07:39.555 --> 07:42.118
Jake! You were supposed to watch her!

07:42.189 --> 07:43.915
She got passed me, man.

07:43.946 --> 07:46.712
I tried to stop her,
but she overpowered me.

07:46.774 --> 07:48.149
Get her <i>out</i> of here!

07:52.556 --> 07:54.274
Finn, kill it!

07:54.297 --> 07:56.196
I can't find it's magic gem weak spot!

07:56.949 --> 07:58.176
Oh, there it is.

08:01.926 --> 08:03.332
I did it! I helped!

08:03.379 --> 08:06.598
I'm the sexiest adventurer in the world!

08:06.707 --> 08:09.113
Tree Trunks! You're <i>not</i> an adventurer!

08:09.183 --> 08:10.699
You nearly got yourself killed,

08:10.715 --> 08:11.356
<i>again!</i>

08:11.387 --> 08:12.887
Do you wanna die, Tree Trunks?!?

08:12.934 --> 08:14.613
Is that what you think adventurers do?!?

08:14.621 --> 08:17.762
Die and make all their friends feel
terrible 'cause they couldn't save you?!?

08:19.441 --> 08:20.535
Whoa, man.

08:21.316 --> 08:23.402
I'm going home now.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.470
Tree Trunks...

08:27.830 --> 08:29.166
Tree Trunks!

08:29.283 --> 08:30.744
Don't follow me.

08:32.455 --> 08:33.556
Oh, Finn...

08:33.798 --> 08:37.736
You shouldn't yell at cuties that
just wanna help you.

08:38.876 --> 08:41.251
Man, I feel horrible.

08:41.298 --> 08:43.751
I was only yelling because
I care about her safety.

08:43.884 --> 08:46.399
That's what happens when you care
too much, dude.

08:47.923 --> 08:49.486
Tree Trunks!

08:50.055 --> 08:53.282
Finn, I found the Crystal Gem Apple.

08:55.735 --> 08:57.289
You're the man, Tree Trunks!

08:57.297 --> 09:00.524
Tree Trunks, I'm a huge butt guy
for getting mad at you.

09:00.564 --> 09:01.884
I'm a huge fart.

09:01.907 --> 09:04.821
I was only upset because I love you and
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

09:04.899 --> 09:06.376
That's precious, Finn.

09:06.415 --> 09:10.930
And I'll accept your apology 
if you let me kiss your cheek.

09:12.437 --> 09:13.733
I don't know, I…

09:13.765 --> 09:16.358
Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man.

09:16.421 --> 09:18.874
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

09:18.898 --> 09:21.991
<i>Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man.</i>

09:22.019 --> 09:25.285
<i>It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. </i>

09:26.092 --> 09:28.006
<i>I don't know, I…</i>

09:28.045 --> 09:29.709
A crystal guardian!

09:29.756 --> 09:33.100
Tree Trunks, stay out of the
monster battle this time.

09:33.123 --> 09:34.787
I don't want you getting hurt.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.849
Alright, I promise I will.

09:37.123 --> 09:37.982
Radical!

09:38.326 --> 09:39.302
Back off you!

09:39.380 --> 09:40.553
<i>Back off you! </i>

09:40.584 --> 09:42.162
Stop copying me!

09:42.919 --> 09:44.436
<i>Stop copying me!</i>

09:50.458 --> 09:51.232
Finn!

09:56.502 --> 09:58.651
He's copying everything we do.

10:00.776 --> 10:03.565
Hey! It's my butterfly-friend.

10:03.589 --> 10:05.159
That's precious.

10:12.717 --> 10:14.834
Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks!

10:14.857 --> 10:17.232
<i>Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks! </i>

10:20.334 --> 10:23.498
Gem-clam! Let's beat it up while
it's copying Tree Trunks!

10:26.146 --> 10:28.427
Crud, this is barf dude.

10:29.857 --> 10:32.271
Oh, man, I'm a total moron!

10:32.310 --> 10:34.709
We gotta fight this one Tree Trunks style.

10:34.748 --> 10:35.896
I'll get the make up.

10:47.411 --> 10:48.865
Hey! Crystal Guardian!

10:48.895 --> 10:51.762
Are you okay with Tree Trunks
taking a bite of that apple?

10:51.817 --> 10:52.849
I'm okay with it.

10:52.871 --> 10:53.878
<i>I'm okay with it. </i>

10:53.919 --> 10:55.021
And I'm stupid.

10:55.068 --> 10:56.036
<i>And I'm stupid. </i>

10:56.895 --> 10:59.638
You heard the guardian, TT.
Bite that thing.

10:59.661 --> 11:00.786
Okay!

11:02.339 --> 11:03.956
Whoo! How's it taste, Tree Trunks?

11:03.971 --> 11:05.019
Yeah! How is it?
