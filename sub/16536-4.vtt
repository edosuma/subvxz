WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:03.045
<i>Previously on Designated Survivor...</i>

00:03.170 --> 00:05.923
I was sitting in my seat,
and then everything went black.

00:06.048 --> 00:07.758
And Congressman MacLeish
in his seat.

00:07.883 --> 00:10.302
This photo was taken six seconds later.
MacLeish survived...

00:10.428 --> 00:11.387
Because he wasn't there.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.889
Governor Royce, I am ordering
you to have your police

00:14.015 --> 00:16.475
stop harassing
the Muslim community in Dearborn.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.102
I've been thinking
about my Chief of Staff.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.812
I have decided to go with Aaron.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.440
I would like to appoint you
as my Special Adviser.

00:22.565 --> 00:23.441
I am Majid Nassar.

00:23.566 --> 00:26.068
Al-Sakar annihilated your government.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.237
Whatever cave, cavern,
or hole he's hiding in,

00:28.362 --> 00:29.989
I want you to find me Majid Nassar.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.263
Come on, come on... Come on.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.631
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- Morning.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.800
Anything happen
during the three hours I slept?

01:30.925 --> 01:34.095
Per your orders, Pentagon's working
around the clock to find Majid Nassar.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.513
Schools have reopened.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.348
The Dow and the NASDAQ
have both resumed trading.

01:37.473 --> 01:38.516
They're both down sharply.

01:38.641 --> 01:40.976
Well, I guess today's not the day
to check on your IRA.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.269
Where are we at with security?

01:42.394 --> 01:44.105
Law enforcement's still on high alert.

01:44.230 --> 01:47.525
Ports, nuclear plants,
soft targets like malls and sports arenas.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.193
Here's a long shot: any good news?

01:49.318 --> 01:50.861
Well, you slept three hours
last night, sir.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.530
Ah, the little things.

01:52.655 --> 01:54.198
Oh, there's one more thing.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.367
Hookstraten insisted
on being the first meeting of the day.

01:56.492 --> 01:58.369
My God, doesn't she ever sleep?

01:59.286 --> 02:00.788
- Morning, Wyatt.
- Morning, Mr. President.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.833
Congresswoman, what a pleasant surprise.

02:03.958 --> 02:06.001
Sir, it's been a whole week
since Majid Nassar

02:06.127 --> 02:07.837
confessed to the Capitol bombing.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.714
The entire country is on pins and needles.
Where are we on our search?

02:10.840 --> 02:12.299
We're working around the clock
to find him.

02:12.424 --> 02:15.427
As 50% of Congress,
I think I deserve more than a sound bite.

02:15.553 --> 02:18.305
Well, unfortunately, you don't have
clearance for more than that.

02:18.430 --> 02:21.142
Sir, every moment that passes
without finding Nassar

02:21.267 --> 02:24.478
is a moment for the American people
to doubt your mettle for this job.

02:24.603 --> 02:27.273
I think this is
when you offer me your full support.

02:27.398 --> 02:30.151
Your boyish sincerity
is your best quality, sir.

02:30.276 --> 02:31.485
I hope you don't lose it.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.154
I'm sorry to interrupt.

02:34.572 --> 02:35.656
If you don't mind, excuse us.

02:35.781 --> 02:36.740
Sir.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.703
What is it?

02:40.828 --> 02:41.829
It's Michigan.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.247
More violence against Muslims?

02:43.372 --> 02:44.707
No, but there's about to be.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.668
Governor Royce
is using your Elizabeth Vargas interview

02:47.793 --> 02:49.628
as justification
to start arresting Muslims again.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.922
He claims that your admission
that you were asked to resign

02:52.047 --> 02:53.674
makes you an illegitimate president.

02:53.799 --> 02:56.343
He's re-imposed the curfew
and banned public gatherings.

02:56.468 --> 02:59.930
I'm guessing the Bill of Rights wasn't
on the Governor's summer reading list.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.098
The IAC--

03:01.223 --> 03:02.391
- The Islamic American Coalition.
- Uh-huh.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.519
They're planning a peaceful protest
outside City Hall in Dearborn,

03:05.644 --> 03:07.688
but they have obvious concerns.
The first time,

03:07.813 --> 03:09.732
the violence was Royce's fault.
We let it happen again--

03:09.857 --> 03:10.649
It'll be ours.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.402
I think it's time to tell the Governor
in no uncertain terms that--

03:13.527 --> 03:16.030
With another phone call?
We tried that. Look how much good it did.

03:16.155 --> 03:17.406
What if we send a legal observer,

03:17.531 --> 03:18.908
monitor the demonstrations,

03:19.033 --> 03:20.743
make sure the Governor
doesn't overstep his bounds?

03:20.868 --> 03:21.702
That's smart.

03:21.827 --> 03:22.912
Straight out of the Kennedy playbook.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.955
We don't have many friends
in the state, but...

03:25.080 --> 03:27.249
I'm sure I can get someone
from the AG's Office--

03:27.374 --> 03:28.250
I can do it.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.086
It has to be someone we can trust,

03:31.212 --> 03:33.839
and who better
than your newly appointed Special Adviser?

03:36.342 --> 03:37.134
You sure?

03:37.259 --> 03:38.510
Absolutely.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.014
General Cochrane says he needs to see you.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.600
Fine. Send him in.
Let's get you on a plane now.

03:48.479 --> 03:49.939
General, it's barely 7:00 a.m.,

03:50.064 --> 03:51.899
and I've already been ambushed
by the presumptive Speaker,

03:52.024 --> 03:54.151
and I am facing
a potential domestic crisis,

03:54.276 --> 03:56.403
so, please, choose your words wisely.

03:56.528 --> 03:58.948
I don't need to, sir.
We found Majid Nassar.

04:16.464 --> 04:20.594
<i>We consider ourselves blessed
and ask only for privacy at this time.</i>

04:21.803 --> 04:24.765
<i>This was the scene earlier today,
as Congressman MacLeish,</i>

04:24.890 --> 04:27.559
<i>the sole survivor of the Capitol attack,
returned...</i>

04:27.685 --> 04:29.353
- Hey, you got a sec?
- Yeah.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.648
<i>...accompanied by his wife Beth.
And in other news...</i>

04:32.773 --> 04:34.775
This is what you want to show me?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.944
MacLeish's empty seat
at the State of the Union?

04:37.069 --> 04:40.072
He lied to me! He told me he was
in his seat when the Capitol blew up.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.158
The man spent his entire adult life
in service to his country.

04:43.284 --> 04:47.663
You were supposed to get a statement,
not turn him into a suspect.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.541
He got up at the exact right moment,
like he knew what was coming.

04:50.666 --> 04:53.335
Hannah, there are a thousand reasons
he could have gotten up:

04:53.460 --> 04:55.796
he was bored, he was thirsty,
he needed to take a leak.

04:55.921 --> 05:00.134
But conspiring with an international
terrorist network to blow up the Capitol?

05:00.259 --> 05:01.802
It's likely not one of them.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.512
Or here's another theory.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.806
Maybe he's not the golden boy
everyone thinks he is.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.728
Have I made a mistake
keeping you on this investigation?

05:10.853 --> 05:12.146
What?

05:12.271 --> 05:15.816
Look, I understand.
If you need time to grieve, if you--

05:15.941 --> 05:16.984
No.

05:17.735 --> 05:18.736
I'm fine.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.739
I hope so.

05:23.532 --> 05:26.618
Because impugning
a congressman's reputation,

05:26.744 --> 05:29.204
it's not gonna bring your boyfriend back.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.378
Mr. Essaway, my name is Emily Rhodes.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.172
I'm Special Adviser to the President.

05:38.297 --> 05:41.342
<i>I wanted to let you know I'm on my way
to Dearborn to monitor your protest.</i>

05:41.467 --> 05:44.303
Ms. Rhodes, I can't tell you
how much we appreciate that.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.222
<i>Governor Royce can't get away
with criminalizing innocent people.</i>

05:47.348 --> 05:49.058
And the President
has no intention of letting him.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.268
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

05:53.228 --> 05:55.147
Hey. Public Engagement
said you're headed to Michigan?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.482
- Yeah.
- Kick Royce's ass for me.

05:56.607 --> 05:57.900
I'll do my best.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.737
Sammy Serafian is an American operative
who has been in Algeria six years

06:01.862 --> 06:03.322
working under nonofficial cover.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.658
16 months ago, he infiltrated Al-Sakar.
This morning,

06:06.784 --> 06:09.036
we received a message from him
confirming a direct link

06:09.161 --> 06:10.829
between Al-Sakar and the attack.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.956
It says he found an unexploded ordnance

06:13.082 --> 06:15.167
with the same unique signature
as the bomb from the Capitol site?

06:15.292 --> 06:18.420
Yes, sir, confirming without a doubt
that Al-Sakar was behind the attack.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.463
Do we have a location?

06:19.588 --> 06:21.882
Serafian was able
to pinpoint Nassar's position:

06:22.007 --> 06:25.219
a compound in the tri-border region
between Mali and Niger.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.805
Satellite surveillance confirms
multiple vehicles

06:27.930 --> 06:29.056
and a heavy perimeter.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.683
- And we think that's Nassar's security.
- Yes, Mr. President.

06:32.309 --> 06:35.312
On your order, F-18s can be deployed
from the USS Eisenhower.

06:35.437 --> 06:36.772
We'll disable their air defense

06:36.897 --> 06:38.565
and reduce them to a stain in the sand

06:38.690 --> 06:39.650
within a matter of seconds.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.360
Where's Agent Serafian now?

06:41.485 --> 06:44.113
- We've lost contact with him, sir.
- We gave him 24 hours to evacuate.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.781
That was six hours ago.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.449
Sir, if we wait for him to surface,

06:47.574 --> 06:49.660
we may lose our window
to take out the enemy.

06:49.785 --> 06:52.037
And what's the probability
that he's in the compound with him now?

06:52.162 --> 06:54.748
- It's high, sir.
- So, in all likelihood,

06:54.873 --> 06:57.084
if we bomb the compound,
we'd be killing an American agent.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.127
He knew the risks, sir.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.045
I have to believe, General,
that he's in Algeria

07:00.170 --> 07:02.506
trying to help his country,
not get killed by it.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.133
We have the enemy in our sights,

07:04.258 --> 07:06.593
the man who destroyed
all three branches of our government,

07:06.718 --> 07:09.263
a thousand Americans.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.474
Are we gonna let one man
stand in the way of retribution?

07:13.267 --> 07:15.018
I need your orders, sir.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.398
What's it gonna be?

07:21.692 --> 07:23.152
Mr. President?

07:31.076 --> 07:31.910
Sir...

07:32.870 --> 07:33.829
Your orders?

07:36.457 --> 07:38.417
We're not bombing one of our own.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.170
Maintain surveillance on Nassar
and keep me informed.

07:41.295 --> 07:44.047
Until Serafian makes contact,
we do nothing.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.924
Understood?

07:47.176 --> 07:48.760
General, understood?

07:48.886 --> 07:50.345
Yes, sir.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.681
Thank you all.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.975
Algeria's agreed to support us
after the bombing, right?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.185
Yes, sir, they did.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.604
Okay, I want you to get President Bishara
on the phone.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.772
- Sure it's a good idea?
- I wanna try a diplomatic approach.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.358
If we can get them to arrest Nassar
and everyone at the compound,

08:03.484 --> 08:04.568
we won't need our military.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.945
We can pull our men out
as soon as he's in custody.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.114
Yes, sir. Excuse me a moment.
I'll be right there. Hey.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.992
<i>I missed three calls
from you while I was in the air.</i>

08:12.117 --> 08:14.203
<i>Yeah, I just wanted to say,
about Michigan...</i>

08:14.328 --> 08:15.204
What about it?

08:15.329 --> 08:16.872
<i>Well, it's a situation out there,</i>

08:16.997 --> 08:20.584
and people should be... careful
when they're in a situation, you know?

08:21.919 --> 08:23.295
Aaron, are you worried about me?

08:23.420 --> 08:24.796
<i>What? No, no...</i>

08:24.922 --> 08:28.759
Look, I'm just saying...
good luck out there, all right?

08:30.719 --> 08:32.304
All right, clear! Let's go!

08:32.429 --> 08:33.804
Let them through!

09:08.966 --> 09:09.758
Governor Royce!

09:09.883 --> 09:11.510
This is quite the welcome committee.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.179
Emily Rhodes,
Special Adviser to President Kirkman.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.557
I am here to observe the IAC's protest.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.850
I know why you're here.
I suggest you and your staff

09:18.976 --> 09:21.019
get back on that plane
and return to Washington.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.564
Um, we're here to help, sir.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.983
Yeah, well, as President Reagan said,

09:26.108 --> 09:28.735
the nine scariest words
in the English language are,

09:28.860 --> 09:31.113
"I'm with the government,
and I'm here to help."

09:31.238 --> 09:32.281
Hmm...

09:32.406 --> 09:34.741
I got enough to worry about
without you people interfering.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.076
Well, I'm sorry, sir,

09:36.201 --> 09:38.328
but that's not really
a decision for you to make.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.914
I'm here by orders of the President.

09:41.039 --> 09:44.668
Let me explain this again
in a way that you'll understand.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.795
The state of Michigan is off-limits

09:46.920 --> 09:51.258
to Tom Kirkman, his staff, his plane,
and, most of all, his presidency.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.676
Understood?

10:08.609 --> 10:09.860
Um, I'm sorry,

10:09.985 --> 10:12.112
I was very clear:
my husband's not up to interviews.

10:12.237 --> 10:14.781
Mrs. MacLeish,
I'm Special Agent Hannah Wells, FBI.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.367
Your husband wanted me
to keep him updated on the case.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.411
Yeah. Come in.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.625
They keep coming every day from all over.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.252
Kindness of strangers.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.713
Yeah, well, he's a symbol of hope.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.131
I was lucky, that's all.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.468
- Morning.
- Morning, Congressman.

10:34.593 --> 10:37.346
Last time I saw you,
you told us to keep you updated,

10:37.471 --> 10:39.389
so... I'd like to show you
a couple things.

10:40.932 --> 10:43.226
This was taken
during the State of the Union.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.397
This was taken seconds before the blast.

10:54.071 --> 10:55.739
I don't understand. Where was I?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.240
Well, that's my question, Congressman.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.203
Maybe you were right.

11:02.204 --> 11:03.372
Maybe that is why I survived.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.582
Peter, the whole world
doesn't have to hear that story.

11:05.707 --> 11:07.459
Not the whole world, Mrs. MacLeish.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.211
Just me.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.921
- Oh, God. It's embarrassing.
- It's all right.

11:11.046 --> 11:14.966
Um, but I was at home in Eugene
with the girls.

11:15.092 --> 11:18.845
We'd gone to the mall to get my oldest
a dress for her winter recital.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.973
I just took my eyes off Lexy -
that's our little one -

11:22.099 --> 11:24.184
for a second, but...
when I turned around, she was gone.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.436
I... I lost my mind.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.106
I must have sent Peter 30 texts.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.774
But 10 minutes later,

11:30.899 --> 11:33.777
a kind woman dropped her
at the security station

11:33.902 --> 11:36.238
and Lexy was eating an ice cream,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.073
not a care in the world.

11:38.949 --> 11:41.910
Uh, that's when I heard about the Capitol.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.454
So you think he was trying to call you?

11:44.579 --> 11:46.415
There's no way
he would have ignored my texts.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.500
I'm sorry. Agent Wells, is there a reason

11:48.625 --> 11:51.253
you're asking all these questions?
Have I done something wrong?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.462
Well, you are the only survivor

11:52.587 --> 11:54.715
of an attack that killed
a thousand people.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.800
So I'm just trying
to find out what happened.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.344
All right.

12:00.721 --> 12:03.640
Hey, Chuck, it's me.
I need you to do me a favor.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.228
Yeah, it's about Peter MacLeish.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.573
<i>Hello?</i>

12:19.698 --> 12:21.074
Ma'am, this is Agent Ritter.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.743
Switchboard just notified me

12:22.868 --> 12:25.245
that there's a call
from an Immigration Detention Center.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.497
<i>A woman named Maria Serrano
claims you're her lawyer.</i>

12:27.622 --> 12:30.792
Yes. Um, okay, well,
have them put her through.

12:30.917 --> 12:31.752
Yes, ma'am.

12:31.877 --> 12:33.420
<i>Mrs. Kirkman, it's Maria.</i>

12:33.545 --> 12:35.964
Hey. Maria, what's... How are you?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.925
ICE got me arrested.
I'm going to be deported.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.094
<i>Deported? What? My office--</i>

12:41.219 --> 12:43.221
<i>Well, it's not really my office anymore.</i>

12:43.346 --> 12:46.183
Duncan is now handling your case.
Have you spoken with him?

12:46.308 --> 12:49.394
Yes. He said there's nothing he can do.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.606
Please help me. They took my kids away.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.191
<i>We cannot go back to Honduras.</i>

12:54.316 --> 12:56.193
No, I know. I know you can't.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.195
Um, okay. You got to stay calm,

12:58.320 --> 13:02.532
and I'm gonna get into this right now,
okay, Maria?

13:02.657 --> 13:05.327
Does the President expect
the Governor to just bow down?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.912
Carter, it's been seven days
since Al-Sakar

13:07.037 --> 13:08.288
took credit for bombing the Capitol.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.749
When can the American people
expect a response?

13:10.874 --> 13:13.168
Uh, the President is busy
meeting with his advisers,

13:13.293 --> 13:15.420
and, um... working up a strategy.

13:15.545 --> 13:16.671
Can you be more specific?

13:16.797 --> 13:18.632
Uh... not really.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.592
- But the President does have a strategy.
- Of course he does.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.844
I mean, he's the President, isn't he?

13:22.969 --> 13:24.346
- So, how's it going here?
- That depends.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.348
Does Kirkman want a second term?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.058
Please, just, uh,
let me answer the question.

13:28.183 --> 13:31.895
I can assure you that the White House
takes the situation most seriously.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.730
"Most seriously"? Who is this guy, anyway?

13:33.855 --> 13:37.108
Carter Dunne, third Deputy Assistant
to the Press Secretary.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.151
Before the bombing.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.862
Now, as the kids say, The Man.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.114
The Prime Minister
of Great Britain and France

13:43.240 --> 13:45.116
have, uh... pledged their support,

13:45.242 --> 13:47.828
should we need it, and there are others
who reached out as well.

13:47.953 --> 13:50.455
- Well, you're gonna have to handle this.
- Why me?

13:50.580 --> 13:51.706
Because you're in communications,

13:51.832 --> 13:54.876
and you can form complete sentences.
You're standing next to me, so go fix it.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.586
- What's the magic word?
- Now.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.339
Not even close.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.008
Not only is Michigan
under attack from radicals,

14:02.133 --> 14:03.593
but our very democracy

14:03.718 --> 14:06.137
<i>is being threatened
by a man who has no right</i>

14:06.263 --> 14:08.181
<i>to call himself President.</i>

14:08.306 --> 14:11.142
<i>Does the man have no shame?</i>

14:11.268 --> 14:12.936
Well, he's got some nerve,
I'll give him that.

14:13.061 --> 14:16.273
<i>As the</i> elected <i>Governor</i>

14:16.398 --> 14:19.317
<i>of this great state,
it's my duty to protect its citizens.</i>

14:19.442 --> 14:22.237
Why should I trust the federal government
to protect us

14:22.362 --> 14:25.907
while a fraudulent President
holds its highest office hostage?

14:26.032 --> 14:27.826
<i>Emily,
you're on with the President.</i>

14:30.287 --> 14:32.289
I'm watching Royce now.
What did he say to you?

14:32.414 --> 14:33.248
<i>For starters,</i>

14:33.373 --> 14:36.001
he's refusing to let me leave the airport
to observe the protest.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.168
Son of a bitch.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.129
<i>And he's making sure
the cameras capture every moment.</i>

14:39.254 --> 14:41.339
<i>I think it's best
if I come back to D.C.</i>

14:42.299 --> 14:44.843
Every minute this plays out
on national TV weakens your position.

14:44.968 --> 14:48.221
No, how weak will our position be
if I don't put up a fight?

14:48.346 --> 14:50.390
If I come back now,
we can rethink our approach and--

14:50.515 --> 14:51.600
No, no, wait. Hold on.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.476
- Wyatt?!
- Coming, sir.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.145
I got an idea.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.355
Just sit tight. I'll get back to you.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.609
Now, I'm sending you with a full detail.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.277
Keep this with you at all times.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.280
You press it and six agents
will be surrounding you in seconds.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.282
Mike, a panic button? Seriously?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.950
I'm going to my firm!

15:09.910 --> 15:10.785
You don't need to worry.

15:10.911 --> 15:14.456
The only thing I'll be in danger of
is a few bad lawyer jokes.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.207
Mrs. Kirkman, it's my job to worry.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.876
You're too good.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.753
Hold on, ma'am.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.839
Copy that.
Ma'am, the President needs you.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.090
He said it's urgent.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.008
Really?

15:25.133 --> 15:26.301
<i>Federalize the Guard?</i>

15:26.426 --> 15:29.095
I thought we'd decided
that that was a nuclear option.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.681
It was. Governor Royce went there first.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.059
Now, is he within his legal rights?

15:34.184 --> 15:36.811
U.S. Code 12406:

15:36.937 --> 15:39.147
the President
can federalize the National Guard

15:39.272 --> 15:41.566
whenever there is a rebellion
or threat of a rebellion

15:41.691 --> 15:43.401
against the U.S. government.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.863
I think this qualifies.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.782
I thought you were
an immigration attorney.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.659
She aced Constitutional Law, too.

15:50.784 --> 15:51.618
Okay...

15:52.369 --> 15:53.453
How do I do this?

15:53.578 --> 15:56.373
You start by declaring
a state of emergency in Michigan.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.708
Yeah, then you notify General Hammond.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.336
He's the Joint Chiefs Chairman
of the National Guard Bureau.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.004
Get me General Hammond.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.673
All right.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.383
Tom...

16:07.968 --> 16:09.135
Forcing a sitting Governor

16:09.260 --> 16:10.470
to cede power to the feds

16:10.595 --> 16:14.015
creates a monumental precedent.

16:14.641 --> 16:15.475
I know.

16:16.393 --> 16:17.811
But this is a tipping point.

16:18.603 --> 16:21.147
If I let Governor Royce
set up a police state...

16:22.190 --> 16:24.734
how can I stop the other 49 Governors
from doing the same thing?

16:26.111 --> 16:27.529
It's time.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.156
Got General Hammond
on the line for you, sir.

16:41.209 --> 16:42.252
General Hammond.

16:42.377 --> 16:43.586
This is the President.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.924
By my command, I am ordering you
to federalize the Michigan National Guard.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.886
The poor men and women

16:52.012 --> 16:54.472
who attended
the State of the Union address

16:54.597 --> 16:57.934
trusted the federal government
to keep them safe.

16:58.059 --> 16:58.935
You federalized the Guard?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.562
<i>Royce doesn't know yet.</i>

17:00.687 --> 17:03.523
He may have won the battle,
but we'll win the war.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.192
Lucky for us we have a standing army
at our disposal.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.193
<i>Okay.</i>

17:07.318 --> 17:09.279
- What's the next step?
<i>- General Muñoz</i>

17:09.404 --> 17:10.696
will be the man you'll deal with.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.406
His troops will escort you
past state police.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.534
He'll stay with you
the entire time you're in Michigan.

17:14.659 --> 17:16.578
<i>This will all be over soon.</i>

17:17.746 --> 17:18.997
Thank you for doing this.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.330
Goodbye.

17:23.667 --> 17:24.836
Sir?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.130
They're waiting for you
in the Cabinet room.

17:27.255 --> 17:29.340
- Has the CIA found Serafian?
- No.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.551
But I have the President of Algeria
on the line.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.970
Okay.

17:37.849 --> 17:40.268
My domestic intelligence
is certain:

17:40.393 --> 17:42.729
Majid Nassar is not in our country.

17:42.854 --> 17:46.900
With all due respect, Mr. President,
our friends on the ground say otherwise.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.276
We need you to arrest Nassar

17:48.401 --> 17:50.403
and any other members
of the Al-Sakar terrorist group

17:50.528 --> 17:51.738
from the compound.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.995
Your friends must be mistaken.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.497
I'm sorry.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.873
I can't be of more help.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.085
Okay, Mr. President.

18:05.210 --> 18:08.046
We expect you'll notify us
if the situation changes.

18:08.171 --> 18:10.673
- Thank you.
- He's lying, sir.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.927
Well, General,
we finally agree on something.

18:14.302 --> 18:16.387
Bishara's own army has radical elements.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.432
They could be feeding him false intel,
telling him Nassar is not there.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.518
- Maybe.
- Our window to act is closing,

18:21.643 --> 18:23.603
especially now we've tipped off Algeria.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.189
Until we know
Agent Serafian is safe, we do nothing.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.607
There's still no word, sir.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.150
But he has 12 hours to make contact.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.944
If we don't hear from him
within that time,

18:31.069 --> 18:32.529
then we have to assume the worst.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.446
Meaning?

18:33.571 --> 18:35.448
No matter what, in 12 hours,
we pull the trigger.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.616
I understand.

18:36.741 --> 18:37.659
Thank you.

18:40.370 --> 18:41.996
It's about taking control.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.582
They're like a pack of wild dogs.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.168
Exactly.
If they sense fear in you, they attack.

18:47.293 --> 18:50.130
You can't let them intimidate you, Carter.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.965
Look, there are three surefire ways

18:52.090 --> 18:54.551
for a Press Secretary
to die a quick death.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.637
You get hostile, you lie, or you guess.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.681
You do any one of those three things,
you're done.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.850
When I get a question
I don't know the answer to?

19:01.975 --> 19:03.309
You deflect.
"We're looking into it."

19:03.434 --> 19:05.478
"We don't have a statement at this time."

19:05.603 --> 19:07.063
"We'll get back to you."

19:07.188 --> 19:08.356
"The President shares your concerns

19:08.481 --> 19:10.817
and is working diligently
to find a solution."

19:10.942 --> 19:11.734
Bingo.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.903
Now go tame those beasts.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.160
<i>As the</i> elected <i>Governor
of this great state...</i>

19:20.285 --> 19:21.744
Congresswoman Hookstraten.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.497
Twice in a day. This is a treat.

19:25.373 --> 19:27.208
Still a standoff in Michigan.

19:28.710 --> 19:31.504
The President hasn't forgotten
that Royce and I are old friends, has he?

19:31.629 --> 19:34.007
Or do I need code-word clearance
for that, too?

19:34.132 --> 19:35.842
We have it under control.

19:36.634 --> 19:40.096
It's just you and I now, Aaron.
We can speak freely.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.391
You first.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.144
The truth is,

19:46.269 --> 19:47.395
your man is flailing,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.480
and it's not just
with this debacle in Michigan,

19:49.606 --> 19:51.816
it's on the Al-Sakar front as well.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.109
That's not very generous, now.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.360
Spare me.

19:54.485 --> 19:57.363
The only reason he's doing anything
is because you leaked that video.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.199
Don't deny it.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.743
I know a political operator
when I see one.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.622
He needed to be pushed
and you gave him a shove.

20:05.747 --> 20:09.125
- Smart man.
- So you came here to compliment me?

20:09.250 --> 20:11.544
And to remind you
that there are people in this town

20:11.669 --> 20:14.339
who might appreciate
what an asset you are...

20:15.215 --> 20:17.300
in ways that Tom Kirkman never will.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.386
You hitched your wagon to a footnote.

20:21.679 --> 20:23.348
Always a pleasure, Congresswoman.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.558
Aaron.

20:29.896 --> 20:30.813
Duncan...

20:30.939 --> 20:32.565
Duncan, when we spoke,

20:32.690 --> 20:35.068
you said that you could handle
the heavy lifting on my cases.

20:35.193 --> 20:36.486
And I am.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.238
Plus, I've got Parker
doing depositions for you.

20:38.363 --> 20:39.530
Veda's filing your appeals--

20:39.656 --> 20:43.409
So why is Maria Serrano calling me
from an ICE detention center?

20:43.534 --> 20:45.245
Because Homeland Security
is taking advantage of the fact

20:45.370 --> 20:47.580
that the courts have been closed.

20:49.207 --> 20:51.376
So they're arresting anyone
without a pending appeal.

20:51.501 --> 20:54.963
And, right, when the courts reopen,
it'll be too late for us to file.

20:55.088 --> 20:55.922
Got it.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.298
Our hands are tied.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.133
You know what kills me about this?

20:59.259 --> 21:02.387
If she'd just applied for refugee status
instead of asylum,

21:02.512 --> 21:04.889
ICE wouldn't have even
looked at her twice.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.267
If I'd just been here,
if I'd been in front of this,

21:07.392 --> 21:09.185
- none of this would have happened.
- Alex!

21:09.310 --> 21:10.186
You didn't abandon them.

21:10.311 --> 21:14.649
You had a change in circumstance
in a summer-blockbuster kind of way.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.567
Okay,
but that doesn't mean I'm gonna give up.

21:16.693 --> 21:19.612
Alex, you've spent a career
fighting for victims,

21:19.737 --> 21:21.281
but you're the First Lady now.

21:21.406 --> 21:22.490
So?

21:26.369 --> 21:28.830
And that has to count for something,
right?

22:21.799 --> 22:24.135
Mr. President,
Ms. Rhodes is on the phone for you.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.012
Thank you.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.180
Em?

22:27.305 --> 22:28.848
Yes, I'm walking to meet Muñoz now.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.350
Would you like to speak with him?

22:30.475 --> 22:32.435
Yes, please, put him on the line.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.606
General, Emily Rhodes,

22:36.731 --> 22:38.399
Special Adviser to the President.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.692
I have President Kirkman for you.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.364
This is General Muñoz.

22:44.489 --> 22:46.115
General,
I wanted to thank you for taking--

22:46.240 --> 22:48.493
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Kirkman,
but as the commanding officer</i>

22:48.618 --> 22:50.036
of the Michigan National Guard,

22:50.161 --> 22:53.915
it is my duty to inform you
we refuse the order to federalize.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.458
You... you can't do that.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.584
The President has a right--

22:56.709 --> 22:58.127
The Michigan State Guard stands behind

22:58.252 --> 23:01.547
its true Commander in Chief,
Governor James Royce.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.804
Unbelievable.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.850
<i>Is it as bad as it looks?</i>

23:12.975 --> 23:15.395
Worse.
Michigan's on the verge of anarchy.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.648
General Cochrane's pushing me to launch
an attack that could kill an American.

23:18.773 --> 23:20.400
And I'm actually considering it.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.237
My God.

23:26.614 --> 23:29.826
I never thought I'd be in a position
to decide who lives or dies.

23:29.951 --> 23:32.203
Oh, Tom, come here. Come here.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.791
Do you remember
the first night that we were here,

23:36.916 --> 23:38.501
when we thought about running away?

23:39.877 --> 23:41.129
And you said no?

23:41.254 --> 23:43.631
That you felt that this was something
you needed to do?

23:43.756 --> 23:45.133
And I think you were right.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.343
There's too much at stake.

23:47.468 --> 23:50.847
If you listen to your instincts,
you will do the right thing.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.558
Well, all I'm saying is,

23:53.683 --> 23:55.852
it'd be a lot easier
if someone left behind a manual.

23:55.977 --> 23:59.772
I guarantee you, past presidents

23:59.897 --> 24:01.899
didn't have it all figured out, either.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.235
They were just people like you

24:04.360 --> 24:06.362
trying to do their best.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.202
Thank you.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.874
Hey, you came to me.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.294
Did you need my help with Maria Serrano?

24:23.296 --> 24:26.883
I'm not sure that using executive
privilege to do your wife a favor

24:27.008 --> 24:29.969
is exactly what our Founding Fathers
had in mind.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.596
What other choices do you have?

24:31.721 --> 24:34.140
I thought of going to Kimble Hookstraten.

24:34.265 --> 24:35.349
Watch your back.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.601
I know.

24:37.685 --> 24:38.811
Ma'am.

24:39.479 --> 24:40.897
Sir, Emily's still waiting.

24:41.022 --> 24:42.607
What would you like to do?

24:45.776 --> 24:47.069
She's on speaker, sir.

24:47.195 --> 24:49.739
Em, it's time for you
to get on a plane and come home.

24:49.864 --> 24:50.990
<i>What? No.</i>

24:51.115 --> 24:53.701
I sent you there to observe a protest,
not intervene in a coup.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.786
Wait, just... hear me out.

24:56.621 --> 24:59.081
Royce is a bully, right?
And how do you beat a bully?

24:59.207 --> 25:00.124
By standing up to him.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.042
We tried that.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.670
Well, what if we try it differently,
change the rules of engagement?

25:04.795 --> 25:07.507
- Offer him a sit-down with you.
<i>- He'll never go for it.</i>

25:07.632 --> 25:09.800
He's made it abundantly clear
what he thinks about my presidency.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.636
He will if it's presented
as his best option.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.638
I'm not willing
to try and win a political fight

25:13.763 --> 25:15.681
if it puts you at risk. It's not worth it.

25:15.806 --> 25:18.809
<i>I appreciate that, but I think
I know a way to get him to D.C.</i>

25:18.935 --> 25:20.728
I just need you to trust me.

25:26.067 --> 25:27.401
You promise you'll be careful.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.028
Yes, sir.

25:34.534 --> 25:35.618
<i>I can assure you the President</i>

25:35.743 --> 25:38.621
is deeply committed
to seeing the standoff in Michigan

25:38.746 --> 25:39.830
come to a peaceful end.

25:39.956 --> 25:42.083
Is the President worried
his standoff with Governor Royce

25:42.208 --> 25:44.835
will damage his already tenuous
relationship with the American people?

25:44.961 --> 25:47.088
No, the President
has more important things to worry about.

25:47.213 --> 25:50.132
President Kirkman doesn't care about
earning the country's confidence?

25:50.258 --> 25:51.175
No, what I mean is...

25:51.926 --> 25:55.012
it's more important to get rid of Royce
than worry whether people like him or not.

25:55.137 --> 25:56.597
The President wants to get rid of Royce?

25:56.722 --> 25:58.808
Is Kirkman planning
to remove a sitting Governor?

25:58.933 --> 26:01.185
Does the President expect the Governor
to bow down?

26:02.228 --> 26:03.688
...gonna get rid of an elected Governor?

26:03.813 --> 26:04.855
I don't think that's gonna happen.

26:04.981 --> 26:07.066
Is the President planning
an armed response?

26:07.191 --> 26:09.068
- Is there any indication--
- Is he leaving?

26:09.193 --> 26:10.319
The Kirkman White House, everyone.

26:10.444 --> 26:11.571
Wow.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.494
Sorry about that, everybody. Carter, uh...
Carter wasn't feeling very well.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.162
Uh, who are you?

26:20.288 --> 26:22.415
My name is Seth Wright.

26:22.540 --> 26:24.500
I'm a speech writer.
I work for the President.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.669
To be clear, the top news story today

26:26.794 --> 26:29.255
has nothing to do with
President Kirkman's standing in the polls

26:29.380 --> 26:32.008
and everything to do with the Islamophobia

26:32.133 --> 26:35.595
jeopardizing the fundamental rights
of American citizens.

26:35.720 --> 26:39.307
But I'm perfectly happy to answer
any relevant questions one at a time.

26:40.641 --> 26:41.934
Yes.

26:44.478 --> 26:45.771
<i>Isaac.</i>

26:45.896 --> 26:48.274
Ms. Rhodes,
the police revoked our permit to protest.

26:48.399 --> 26:49.900
They're threatening to make arrests.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.653
<i>I have a hundred people
ready to march on City Hall,</i>

26:52.778 --> 26:54.697
but they're afraid
of what will happen if they do.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.158
Forget about City Hall.
The local police aren't worth the fight.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.200
<i>Ms. Rhodes, no.</i>

26:59.035 --> 27:01.579
- No, we can't back down now.
<i>- I'm not asking you to.</i>

27:01.704 --> 27:04.165
I'm asking you to take the fight
directly to Royce.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.958
How quickly can you get to the airport?

27:51.754 --> 27:53.756
If you people
don't have a permit to be here,

27:53.881 --> 27:55.925
you need to leave immediately!

28:01.305 --> 28:03.099
I want to speak to the Governor!

28:03.224 --> 28:04.684
So this is it?

28:05.226 --> 28:07.228
This is Emily's master plan?

28:07.937 --> 28:10.523
How long before it turns
into a Selma or Kent State?

28:10.648 --> 28:12.066
Come on, Aaron, you of all people

28:12.191 --> 28:14.068
should acknowledge
this is a brilliant move.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.529
Governor Royce can't incite violence
on national television.

28:16.654 --> 28:17.780
He'll lose the moral high ground.

28:17.905 --> 28:20.366
Well, that's assuming that bigot
cares about the moral high ground.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.493
Governor, let's go.

28:23.994 --> 28:27.164
Is this really how you want today to end?
With heavily armed soldiers

28:27.289 --> 28:31.043
dragging peaceful protestors
off to jail while the nation watches?

28:31.168 --> 28:33.212
You won't be the hero of that story.

28:33.337 --> 28:34.630
You think you're pretty clever, don't you?

28:34.755 --> 28:36.257
I have an offer for you.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.760
Send them home and fly with me
to D.C. for a sit-down with the President.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.430
Claim his attention as a victory.
Spin it however you want.

28:42.555 --> 28:44.014
Why the hell should I go with you?

28:44.140 --> 28:45.224
Because standing
in the schoolhouse doorway

28:45.349 --> 28:48.352
didn't work for George Wallace,
and it isn't gonna work for you.

28:50.730 --> 28:53.149
History will remember you for this.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.446
Come on, Governor. What are you gonna do?

29:00.740 --> 29:01.949
Sir...

29:02.074 --> 29:04.994
I'm afraid we have a second mutiny
on our hands.

29:08.038 --> 29:10.583
We have the F-18s in...

29:11.375 --> 29:12.835
Mr. President,
I wasn't expecting you, sir.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.503
That's pretty obvious, General.

29:14.628 --> 29:18.132
Is it true that you gave the order
to take the Algerian air defenses offline?

29:18.257 --> 29:21.844
Yes, sir.
I ordered Cyb-Command at Fort Meade

29:21.969 --> 29:24.054
to set a glide path
through Algerian airspace.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.683
Without clearing it through me or Algeria,
which happens to be one of our allies.

29:27.808 --> 29:30.394
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but is that not an act of war?

29:30.519 --> 29:31.479
It was necessary preparation.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.272
For an attack I have not authorized yet.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.107
You tried diplomacy. It failed.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.485
And now you're risking the entire country
to protect one person?

29:37.610 --> 29:39.278
I did what needed to be done.

29:39.403 --> 29:40.237
Well, General...

29:40.362 --> 29:43.574
One day, if you become President,
you can make that call.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.535
But as long as I am
and one of our own is unaccounted for,

29:46.660 --> 29:47.995
we do nothing

29:48.120 --> 29:50.289
that will jeopardize their safety
any further.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.249
I agreed to 12 hours.

29:52.374 --> 29:55.044
These terrorists came to our home.
They killed our people.

29:55.169 --> 29:56.962
Any sacrifices we make

29:57.087 --> 29:58.756
to eradicate them
from the face of the Earth

29:58.881 --> 30:00.132
are sacrifices worth making.

30:00.257 --> 30:02.051
When a snake's in your kitchen,

30:02.176 --> 30:04.970
you don't invite it to dinner,
you cut off its head.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.349
You make a good point, General.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.729
And seeing that this is my kitchen...

30:14.855 --> 30:17.483
I am relieving you of your command,
effective immediately.

30:17.608 --> 30:20.027
- What?
- General, you are fired.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.797
The President is grateful
you've agreed to speak with him.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.173
Didn't have much of a choice.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.219
Look, I know you think
I'm a bad man, Ms. Rhodes,

30:45.344 --> 30:47.513
but the Christians and the Jews
didn't blow up the Capitol

30:47.638 --> 30:50.641
or run planes into the Twin Towers.
Muslims did.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.601
No, sir, extremists did.

30:53.477 --> 30:56.564
And persecuting innocent people
won't make any of us safer.

30:56.689 --> 30:58.607
You're just like your boss, aren't you?

30:58.732 --> 31:01.819
You think you know better than
those of us with decades of experience.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.654
In the years that I've known Tom Kirkman,

31:03.779 --> 31:06.740
I have found him
to be thoughtful and reasonable.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.993
If you give him a chance,
I think you will, too.

31:12.162 --> 31:15.165
Rest looks great. Just get rid
of those two paragraphs, move that up.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.084
You hear the rumor?
There's a rising star

31:17.209 --> 31:18.919
in the White House Communications Office.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.796
That's cold, man.

31:20.921 --> 31:24.550
Thank you. That poor guy is probably
halfway to Dubuque by now.

31:24.675 --> 31:25.759
I was talking about you.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.012
You know, half the press corps
just threatened to forfeit

31:28.137 --> 31:30.806
their credentials
if I didn't hire you as his replacement.

31:30.931 --> 31:32.266
You want me to be Press Secretary?

31:33.267 --> 31:34.768
Don't look so surprised.

31:34.894 --> 31:37.438
This administration
can use someone like you

31:37.563 --> 31:39.398
standing up there at the podium every day.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.358
What do you mean, someone like me?

31:41.483 --> 31:43.777
What, you're gonna make me say it?

31:45.112 --> 31:46.447
You're smart. You're likable.

31:46.572 --> 31:49.241
- You're quick on your feet.
- Okay.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.535
By that definition, so is a Dalmatian.
Why me?

31:53.162 --> 31:55.414
You're also the son of Muslim immigrants

31:55.539 --> 31:58.959
at a time when American people
associate the word Islam with terrorism.

31:59.084 --> 32:02.129
Now, as Press Secretary,
you can help change that perception.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.924
You want to parade me around
as the President's friendly Muslim?

32:05.049 --> 32:07.426
If that's what it takes
to start changing hearts and minds, yes.

32:07.551 --> 32:08.636
- Unbelievable.
- Hey, this is Washington.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.763
You seize opportunity
when it presents itself,

32:10.888 --> 32:13.641
whether you like
the motives behind it or not.

32:17.061 --> 32:18.395
- Just take the job, man.
- Or what?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.814
You're gonna find somebody else
who looks like me to do it?

32:20.940 --> 32:22.024
Get out of my office.

32:23.817 --> 32:24.985
All right.

32:29.782 --> 32:31.200
<i>I'm moved by Maria's story,</i>

32:31.325 --> 32:33.035
but I don't know what I can do.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.329
Congress is comprised of two people now,

32:35.454 --> 32:38.248
one of whom's barely out of the hospital.

32:38.374 --> 32:42.503
Even if we could change policy,
it would take months, if not years.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.838
But you were on the Subcommittee
of Immigration and Border Security.

32:44.964 --> 32:46.674
Why don't you just
come out and ask me

32:46.799 --> 32:50.010
what you came here to ask me,
Mrs. Kirkman?

32:50.135 --> 32:52.888
If you call Maria as a witness
before your subcommittee

32:53.013 --> 32:54.306
when the new Congress is seated--

32:54.431 --> 32:56.350
And she would be granted immunity,

32:56.475 --> 32:59.019
as long as she's expected to testify.

32:59.144 --> 33:03.065
If I call her
to this hypothetical hearing...

33:03.774 --> 33:06.193
I would be doing so
as a favor to you, ma'am.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.153
- And I'd be very grateful.
- A favor

33:08.278 --> 33:10.531
that I hope you would return one day,

33:10.656 --> 33:11.824
should I need it.

33:11.949 --> 33:14.118
So you're saying I'd owe you.

33:14.243 --> 33:16.370
We all want to do the right thing,
Mrs. Kirkman.

33:16.954 --> 33:19.707
But the right thing is seldom free.

33:25.004 --> 33:26.547
So, I got your e-mail.

33:27.297 --> 33:29.883
So this morning, you were obsessed
with the Capitol bombing,

33:30.009 --> 33:31.719
and now you want to be reassigned?

33:31.844 --> 33:34.179
I went back to MacLeish.
You were right.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.140
Everything he said checked out.

33:36.265 --> 33:39.351
He had a good reason for not being
in his seat when the bomb went off.

33:41.103 --> 33:42.396
I tried to tear his story apart.

33:42.521 --> 33:46.567
I talked to mall security in Oregon.
I got phone records.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.695
I wanted him to be guilty of something

33:49.820 --> 33:52.114
so I could blame him for surviving
when no one else did!

34:04.251 --> 34:06.170
You know what the truth is?

34:08.672 --> 34:12.592
The truth is that Peter MacLeish
is just a lucky guy.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.554
He survived, and Scott didn't,

34:15.679 --> 34:17.848
and I need to start dealing with that.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.100
That's fair.

34:20.976 --> 34:25.773
You know, you... are a pain in my ass
more often than you're not.

34:27.190 --> 34:30.694
But you are also passionate...
and persistent.

34:30.819 --> 34:33.072
And that's what makes you
one of the best agents I have.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.322
I could be just as passionate...

34:35.491 --> 34:36.784
working Cyber Crimes,

34:36.909 --> 34:38.911
or Healthcare Fraud.

34:39.036 --> 34:40.036
Send me to Michigan.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.206
I'll work
on civil-rights violations there.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.626
All right.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.628
If you want the transfer,
I'll put in the request.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.670
But do me a favor: you sleep on this.

34:49.797 --> 34:52.591
Because I know you,
and you're gonna hate yourself

34:52.716 --> 34:55.636
if you quit just because it got hard.

35:15.739 --> 35:18.158
President Kirkman, Governor Royce.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.952
Welcome to Washington, D.C.

35:20.077 --> 35:21.161
Thank you.

35:21.286 --> 35:24.623
Took some doing, but I had a very nice
conversation with your Special Advisor.

35:25.541 --> 35:28.335
And I welcome this chance
for an honest and open dialogue.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.796
I think you'll find
I'm not gonna be very flexible on this.

35:30.921 --> 35:33.173
You see, I believe that all Americans,

35:33.298 --> 35:34.967
regardless of race or religion,

35:35.092 --> 35:38.387
should be afforded and protected
by the same inalienable rights.

35:38.512 --> 35:40.222
- If I may--
- You may not.

35:40.347 --> 35:41.598
Governor, you violated the rights

35:41.723 --> 35:43.684
of the citizens of Michigan,
and today,

35:43.809 --> 35:46.812
you conspired with the National Guard
to defy a direct order from the President.

35:47.521 --> 35:48.313
James Royce,

35:48.438 --> 35:51.150
I'm placing you under arrest for treason
against the United States of America.

35:51.275 --> 35:52.401
Marshals.

35:55.279 --> 35:56.989
Reasonable and thoughtful, huh?

36:08.458 --> 36:11.879
Mr. President, you lied to me.
You said

36:12.004 --> 36:15.048
you'd trust me to fix this, and I did.
He was ready to talk to you.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.676
The Governor was using a national tragedy
to further his own agenda.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.469
He broke the law, he's going to jail.

36:19.595 --> 36:23.265
I told him he could count on you
to be reasonable and just.

36:24.766 --> 36:26.935
Did you know that during the Civil War,

36:27.060 --> 36:29.313
President Lincoln suspended habeas corpus

36:29.438 --> 36:32.524
and arrested a legislator
for trying to block Union troops

36:32.649 --> 36:33.734
from going south?

36:33.859 --> 36:35.736
I did what I thought was best.

36:35.861 --> 36:36.862
For yourself.

36:36.987 --> 36:38.780
No, for the country.

36:38.906 --> 36:40.949
And I sent a message
to every other Governor who thinks

36:41.074 --> 36:42.868
they can question
the legitimacy of this presidency.

36:42.993 --> 36:45.037
And anyone who thinks
that they can usurp that

36:45.162 --> 36:47.748
needs to know
that they will face the consequences.

36:47.873 --> 36:51.168
You did a great job, and I'm proud of you.

36:51.293 --> 36:53.295
I'm starting to realize
more than I ever wanted to

36:53.420 --> 36:56.423
that doing the right thing
doesn't always make you feel good.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.136
Mr. President.

37:03.055 --> 37:04.932
Sir, I have an update on Serafian.

37:05.057 --> 37:05.974
Good, so he's safe.

37:06.099 --> 37:08.310
A body was just delivered
on the embassy steps in Algiers.

37:08.435 --> 37:09.645
We're awaiting an ID.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.856
- Ride with me.
- Sir.

37:22.616 --> 37:25.577
Mr. President! You're here late.

37:25.702 --> 37:27.454
Well, technically, I live here, so...

37:27.579 --> 37:29.456
it appears you're the one who's here late.
Please, sit.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.291
Thank you, sir.

37:33.543 --> 37:36.171
Aaron told me that you turned down
the job of Press Secretary.

37:36.296 --> 37:37.714
I did, sir.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.133
It's a shame.
I was the one who offered it.

37:41.093 --> 37:43.220
Sir... with all due respect,

37:43.345 --> 37:45.722
I felt there were other people
far more qualified than I was.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.349
Rosemary Jones, for example,

37:47.474 --> 37:49.142
has three years experience
on Senator Ford's staff--

37:49.268 --> 37:52.145
Carter had a pretty good résumé, too,
and look how that turned out.

37:54.022 --> 37:57.317
Aaron's motivations were political,
but mine were simple.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.945
I was just looking
for the right person for the job.

38:00.988 --> 38:03.699
Today's crisis was racially motivated.

38:05.075 --> 38:07.119
Tomorrow's could be gun control,
a women's issue.

38:07.244 --> 38:10.080
I just wanted to have someone
on the podium that I respected.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.626
Come on, Seth, don't make me beg.

38:15.585 --> 38:17.129
Can I count on you?

38:17.254 --> 38:19.464
It would be my honor, Mr. President.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.550
Good.

38:22.592 --> 38:25.012
'Cause if you thought today was intense,
I'm gonna need you tomorrow.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.471
Why? What's going on tomorrow?

38:27.306 --> 38:29.349
I can't tell you, 'cause it's classified.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.935
But I'll let you know when it happens.

38:35.314 --> 38:36.690
Get some rest.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.650
Thank you, sir. Good night.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.360
Thank you.

38:47.743 --> 38:49.286
I need you to be straight with me.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.496
Arresting Governor Royce,

38:51.621 --> 38:52.664
tell me that was your idea.

38:52.789 --> 38:56.209
I wish I could take the credit for that,
but that was all Kirkman.

38:56.335 --> 38:59.421
Look, honestly,
I didn't think he had it in him.

39:00.964 --> 39:03.008
Still got that bottle?

39:03.133 --> 39:04.343
Yeah.

39:05.344 --> 39:07.346
He's turning into a different person.

39:07.971 --> 39:10.057
I mean, unless I didn't
really know him before.

39:10.182 --> 39:11.058
Look, Emily...

39:11.183 --> 39:13.226
This isn't HUD anymore.

39:13.352 --> 39:16.355
Your boss is the most powerful man
in the world.

39:16.480 --> 39:19.316
And he's gonna do things
that you might not agree with.

39:19.441 --> 39:23.320
And you need to be ready for that,
because it is your job,

39:23.445 --> 39:27.199
which, if I haven't said before,
you happen to be pretty damn good at.

39:29.576 --> 39:32.496
Sorry, I didn't realize you were capable
of giving compliments.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.289
Guess I'm learning a lot
about people today.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.333
And to think I was worried about you.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.251
You were!

39:38.377 --> 39:39.252
I knew it.

39:39.378 --> 39:40.295
Not that worried.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.923
Just... mildly concerned, is all.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.550
Shut up and pour me a drink.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.268
Good evening. Thank you all
for, uh, staying so late tonight.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.270
I know we've called you in
a few times today.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.815
Uh, just a reminder,
my name is Seth Wright.

39:59.940 --> 40:03.360
Uh, earlier tonight,
I was named White House Press Secretary.

40:04.528 --> 40:07.781
You were very tough on my predecessor,
so I know you're gonna take it easy on me.

40:10.492 --> 40:13.620
Uh, to be honest, I didn't want this job.

40:14.413 --> 40:15.831
But we live in a time

40:15.956 --> 40:19.835
in which we're called upon
to serve in ways we didn't anticipate.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.878
<i>None of us is perfect.</i>

40:23.046 --> 40:27.050
<i>But we do our best
because this House is worthy of our best.</i>

40:29.052 --> 40:32.597
<i>We trust our instincts
as we fight our daily fights.</i>

40:33.765 --> 40:34.891
<i>Some we'll win.</i>

40:35.976 --> 40:37.436
<i>Some we won't.</i>

40:39.146 --> 40:41.273
<i>And some we'll only know in time.</i>

40:45.402 --> 40:47.112
<i>But we leave each night</i>

40:47.237 --> 40:50.782
<i>hopeful that today's sacrifices
have been worth it,</i>

40:50.907 --> 40:53.660
<i>that our instincts have not led us astray,</i>

40:55.662 --> 40:58.707
<i>and that our best...
has been good enough.</i>

41:00.083 --> 41:01.126
Thanks for indulging me.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.170
While I have you here,
a couple of quick announcements,

41:03.295 --> 41:04.796
and then you can get some sleep.

41:24.316 --> 41:25.817
This is Agent Wells.

41:26.902 --> 41:28.195
<i>Find room 105.</i>

41:28.320 --> 41:30.030
Wait, who is this?

41:30.155 --> 41:31.698
<i>Find room 105</i>

41:31.823 --> 41:34.868
<i>and you'll understand more
about Peter MacLeish.</i>

41:34.993 --> 41:36.870
Hello?

41:36.995 --> 41:38.872
Wait, hello?!

41:52.135 --> 41:54.679
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

41:54.804 --> 41:55.722
Sir!

41:59.559 --> 42:02.103
Did we get a positive ID
on Serafian's body yet?

42:02.229 --> 42:03.980
Yes, sir, it's been confirmed.

42:07.651 --> 42:10.028
That tragedy lands at my door.

42:11.112 --> 42:12.280
I'm sorry.

42:13.365 --> 42:14.157
Admiral Chernow,

42:14.282 --> 42:15.575
you are in command.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.245
I would like to proceed
with the attack in Algeria as planned.

42:18.370 --> 42:19.704
Sir?

42:20.664 --> 42:22.958
Admiral... prepare us for war.
