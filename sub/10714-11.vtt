00:03.029 --> 00:04.392
Hey, honey. What's up?

00:04.432 --> 00:05.664
I'm on with The Gooch.

00:05.666 --> 00:07.233
Oh, I love The Gooch!

00:07.235 --> 00:09.362
Give me a Pearl Jam
trivia question. I...

00:09.387 --> 00:11.965
You're... you're talking to
Seattle's number one Pearl Jam fan.

00:11.990 --> 00:15.193
If you don't believe me, ask any one
of the four message boards I moderate.

00:16.511 --> 00:19.195
Mike, I lost your rake.
Can I borrow another one?

00:19.220 --> 00:20.601
He's on with The Gooch!

00:20.626 --> 00:25.084
Ooh, I love The Gooch. I love it
when he says, "You got Gooched," eh?

00:25.086 --> 00:28.201
Shh, shh, shh. Name two
ex-Pearl Jam drummers.

00:28.226 --> 00:31.513
How about four? Ah, Dave
Krusen, Matt Chamberlain,

00:31.538 --> 00:34.742
Dave Abbruzzese, Jack
Irons. (mouths) Slam!

00:37.134 --> 00:39.937
- I won? I won! I'm going to Pearl Jam!
- Oh!

00:39.962 --> 00:41.200
That's awesome.

00:41.202 --> 00:42.765
Yeah, I'm in a room full of people.

00:42.790 --> 00:44.316
He wants me to turn the radio up.

00:44.819 --> 00:46.835
<i>So, caller, are you happy?</i>

00:46.860 --> 00:48.743
- Ecstatic.
- <i>That's great.</i>

00:48.768 --> 00:52.272
<i>Well, it would be great if this
weren't The Prank of the Week!</i>

00:52.297 --> 00:54.447

00:54.449 --> 00:56.345
<i>We don't really have Pearl Jam tickets.</i>

00:56.370 --> 00:58.002
<i>You just got Gooched.</i>

00:58.027 --> 01:00.389
Ha-hah! That's what I was talking about.

01:01.888 --> 01:03.408
Well, it's official.

01:04.092 --> 01:05.692
There is no God.

01:06.861 --> 01:08.780
What's wrong with Dad? Did someone die?

01:08.805 --> 01:10.229
In a way, yes.

01:10.746 --> 01:13.291
He just lost out on Pearl Jam Tickets.

01:13.316 --> 01:14.588
Oh, I can get you those.

01:14.613 --> 01:18.261
Stella, you better not be joking,
and that goes for all of you.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.784
Do not [bleep] with me right now.

01:22.009 --> 01:24.142
I'm serious, Dad.

01:24.445 --> 01:27.518
My new boyfriend, Hashtag,
he's the drummer of Riptide,

01:27.815 --> 01:29.782
They're the band that's
opening for Pearl Jam.

01:30.351 --> 01:33.511
There is a God, and He rocks.

01:33.536 --> 01:36.183
That is awesome. Can you
get another ticket for Shea?

01:36.208 --> 01:37.910
Can't it be just a you and me thing?

01:37.935 --> 01:40.317
It could be a Daddy-Stella
date like when I was little.

01:40.342 --> 01:41.995
You know what? We'll
fly there in my chopper

01:42.020 --> 01:43.782
just like we did in the old days.

01:43.807 --> 01:45.641
Ah! I love you, Stella.

01:45.666 --> 01:47.381
I love all of you right now.

01:48.468 --> 01:49.692
Dad...

01:50.271 --> 01:52.477
have your eyes always been so blue?

01:55.408 --> 01:57.476
They're green, but thank you.

02:01.014 --> 02:02.433
Good morning, all.

02:02.592 --> 02:05.434
Shea, are you wearing the
same thing you wore last night?

02:05.459 --> 02:08.643
I am. And we all know
what that indicates.

02:09.389 --> 02:13.476
Oh, my God. You're doing the
walk of shame. That's my thing.

02:13.528 --> 02:16.792
Is it a walk of shame if
I'm proud of it? I think not.

02:17.832 --> 02:20.232
All I can think of now
is when can I text him?

02:20.234 --> 02:22.401
Or should I wait for him to text me?

02:22.403 --> 02:24.832
What's the proper postcoital protocol?

02:25.072 --> 02:27.072
You know what? No biggie. Whatever.

02:27.074 --> 02:28.666
Somebody tell me what to do.

02:29.510 --> 02:30.976
Do not text him.

02:30.978 --> 02:33.390
- You'll look desperate.
- They're right.

02:33.415 --> 02:35.093
You need a distraction.

02:35.118 --> 02:38.063
You should come to my poker game.
It's just me and a few other guards.

02:38.088 --> 02:39.289
Thanks, Grandma.

02:39.314 --> 02:43.179
Well, while you hens are clucking over
the cards, I'll be at the gun range.

02:43.204 --> 02:46.585
I gotta stay sharp in case they
call me back in for one last case.

02:46.610 --> 02:49.958
Oh, would that be the case
of the delusional old man?

02:54.668 --> 02:56.803
You know, I used to
shoot when I was a kid.

02:56.904 --> 02:59.371
Going out back with my Pa.

02:59.373 --> 03:02.808
Target practice with cans and bottles.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.777
The rusted out El Camino,

03:04.779 --> 03:07.209
the other rusted out El Camino.

03:07.281 --> 03:09.293
I didn't know you could shoot.

03:09.318 --> 03:12.468
Once shot a possum without
even slowing the tractor down.

03:12.553 --> 03:15.068
I love when Mom gets all "Duck Dynasty."

03:16.190 --> 03:18.357
Hey, why don't I come with you, Bob?

03:18.359 --> 03:20.633
Ah, I like to shoot alone, Martina.

03:20.799 --> 03:22.228
Yeah, I understand.

03:22.230 --> 03:25.370
I mean, what guy likes
being shown up by a woman?

03:25.907 --> 03:29.041
Passive aggressive challenge, eh?

03:29.066 --> 03:30.724
Accepted.

Don't finish that sentence, Martina.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.984
I know that whatever you're about to say

- Resist.
- But it's important.

Fight it. Fight it!

04:23.750 --> 04:27.131
I Googled Stella's boyfriend, Hashtag,
just to see what he looked like,

04:27.133 --> 04:28.866
and there was a link to a blog,

04:28.868 --> 04:31.780
and it's all very hush-hush
so the fans won't know,

04:31.805 --> 04:33.280

04:33.305 --> 04:37.183
Ugh! You and that Google! Geez.

04:37.208 --> 04:38.541

04:38.544 --> 04:40.845
No. I'm sure she doesn't.

04:40.847 --> 04:42.780
I mean, Stella does a lot of bad things,

04:42.782 --> 04:45.467
but I don't think she would
want to ruin a marriage.

04:45.492 --> 04:46.984
We have to tell her.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.886
All right, in situations like this,

04:48.888 --> 04:51.914
I like to ask myself: W.W.E.V.D?

04:52.492 --> 04:53.921
What would Eddie Vedder do?

04:55.862 --> 05:00.364
Any chance he'd sit down with
his daughter and open a dialogue?

05:00.366 --> 05:05.067
No, he'd grab his ax and head off to
East Java with surf god Laird Hamilton;

05:05.571 --> 05:08.021
drop in on some major tubular action.

05:08.908 --> 05:11.435
And how does that help us?

05:11.766 --> 05:13.931
It doesn't. It's just
fun to think about.

05:17.749 --> 05:19.250
Mike, come back. (snapping)

05:19.252 --> 05:21.782
Okay, fine. You know
what? I'm gonna tell her.

05:21.807 --> 05:24.667
She'll break up with Hashtag,
and I won't go to the concert.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.658
And it's the right thing to
do, and we'll all be happy.

05:27.660 --> 05:32.924
So if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna
take a sad nap in my Pearl Jammies.

05:37.069 --> 05:40.337
So, you spent last night with him,
and he still hasn't texted you?

05:40.339 --> 05:41.772
- No.
- Called you?

05:41.774 --> 05:43.184
- No.
- Sent flowers?

05:43.209 --> 05:45.342
Flowers? Guys don't send flowers

05:47.138 --> 05:49.095

Oh, I did it right.

05:52.618 --> 05:53.837
I'm pretty sure.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.054
I'm sure you did, sweetie.

Your breadstick body can be just

06:02.149 --> 06:05.663
Shea, the bottom line is
you can't text him first.

06:05.665 --> 06:09.133
Yeah, I hear what you're saying,
but what if I really, really want to?

06:09.135 --> 06:12.303
So, you just came in here to
get permission to text this guy?

06:12.305 --> 06:15.681
Shea, nobody's gonna tell you
to do that. It's a bad idea.

06:15.706 --> 06:17.575
You got to play the game.

06:17.577 --> 06:21.045
Oh, Grandma, Nate's not like other guys.
He said he doesn't want to play games.

Oh, honey, that's a classic
first move in the game.

06:23.944 --> 06:26.784
That's like the traditional
kickoff of the game.

That's what someone who's good at
playing the game says about the game.

about our relationship.

06:55.981 --> 06:58.549
Yeah. My dad taught me.

He also taught me how to clean a fish,

dress a deer, and open

- Mm.
- Mm.

10:35.664 --> 10:36.964
You're just trying to scare me.

10:36.966 --> 10:38.471
It's the truth.

10:38.496 --> 10:41.669
There was this one inmate...
good, church-going woman...

10:41.671 --> 10:43.637
her boyfriend didn't
call her the next day,

10:43.639 --> 10:45.544
she chased him, he pulled away...

10:45.569 --> 10:46.987
- As men do.
- Mm-hm.

10:47.012 --> 10:49.810
And she got so mad, she took a knife...

10:49.812 --> 10:51.178
My God, did she kill him?

10:51.180 --> 10:55.485
No! Didn't you hear me say she
was a good, church-going woman?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.386
She just cut off his [bleep].

11:00.195 --> 11:02.490
I saw the file. It had pictures.

11:02.492 --> 11:03.732
- Mm.
- Oh, me too.

11:03.757 --> 11:05.659
You know, when they're off the body,

11:05.661 --> 11:08.521
- they just don't look right.
- (all) Mm-mm.

11:08.546 --> 11:11.702
It's like seeing your junior
high teacher at the supermarket.

11:11.727 --> 11:14.000
- You don't belong here.
- Mm-hm.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.653
Agreed. They should be attached.

11:18.441 --> 11:21.221
And I get it. And thank you.

11:21.563 --> 11:24.145
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go for a walk.

11:24.147 --> 11:26.370
Nobody's gonna tell
you to text that boy.

11:26.382 --> 11:27.683
You don't know that!

11:27.708 --> 11:28.997

11:29.022 --> 11:31.385
(gunshots)

11:31.387 --> 11:34.896
- Ugh.
- Well... one of those hit the target.

11:34.921 --> 11:36.262
My target.

11:38.226 --> 11:40.103
Less talkin'. More shootin'.

11:40.128 --> 11:42.454
Whatever you say, Annie Choke-ly.

11:43.821 --> 11:45.863
How long did it take you
to come up with that one?

11:45.888 --> 11:47.349
Not as long as you think.

11:48.371 --> 11:50.271
Let's just get to it, old man.

11:50.273 --> 11:52.994
Ooh, tough talk for someone
who shoots like a girl.

11:53.309 --> 11:54.818
I don't shoot like a girl.

11:54.843 --> 11:58.088
I shoot like a country-ass
redneck, and don't you forget it.

11:58.815 --> 12:03.392
And women shoot great, you grumpy,
stubborn, misogynistic, pig-headed...

12:03.417 --> 12:05.530
Just shut up and let me shoot, Linda.

12:07.289 --> 12:08.489
Linda?

12:10.583 --> 12:12.321
Oh...

12:12.346 --> 12:14.295
That's what's happening here.

12:14.297 --> 12:15.904
Nothing's happening here.

12:16.232 --> 12:19.834
You just called me by your ex-wife's
name, who you never talk about.

12:19.836 --> 12:21.540
Something's happening.

12:21.565 --> 12:24.448
Don't talk to me like
I'm one of your patients.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.274
You just threw a fish at a
fisherman. I'm gonna catch it.

12:27.276 --> 12:29.040
Just like your pappy taught you?

12:29.145 --> 12:30.644
What's that supposed to mean?

12:30.646 --> 12:33.110
You have got daddy issues.

12:33.427 --> 12:35.547
See? I can be a therapist, too.

12:36.466 --> 12:39.810
I've slept with enough younger women
to know what a daddy issue looks like.

12:41.923 --> 12:44.358
So, sleeping around after
your wife left you...

12:44.360 --> 12:46.848
yeah, nothing sad or
transparent about that.

12:47.263 --> 12:48.896
All right, that's it. I've had enough.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.655
Oh, wait, Bob. I...

12:51.000 --> 12:52.253
I'm sorry.

12:53.088 --> 12:55.582
I'm sorry if I crossed
the line there. Ah...

12:55.806 --> 12:58.883
maybe calling me Linda was
just a slip of the tongue.

12:58.908 --> 13:00.395
No, it wasn't.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.310
The truth is,

13:03.500 --> 13:05.218
you do remind me of her.

13:06.524 --> 13:09.514
Maybe that's why I didn't
like you right off the bat.

13:09.785 --> 13:11.246
You didn't?

13:11.354 --> 13:13.818
But I'm so great right off the bat.

13:14.657 --> 13:16.739
Off the bat's where I shine.

13:18.062 --> 13:20.753
I liked you, but I
was worried about Mike.

13:20.997 --> 13:24.589
I was afraid you'd grow tired of
him the way my ex grew tired of me.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.672
Hey...

13:26.697 --> 13:30.219
there's no way I'm ever leaving
Mike. He's too good looking.

13:31.509 --> 13:34.076
And he's aging very well.
I'm not giving that up.

13:34.101 --> 13:35.016
(laughs)

13:35.041 --> 13:36.726
Takes after his old man. Huh?

13:36.751 --> 13:38.258
Yes, he does.

13:39.173 --> 13:41.480
And I do have some daddy issues.

13:41.684 --> 13:43.584
He did want a boy.

13:43.586 --> 13:45.238
But I'm glad I was a girl,

13:45.321 --> 13:49.890
because that meant I'd never be what
he wanted, and I liked pissing him off.

13:49.892 --> 13:51.492
(both laughs)

13:51.494 --> 13:53.832
That may be my favorite
thing you've ever said.

13:54.212 --> 13:58.226
Still angry at the old man, not gonna
let it go. You're my kind of gal.

13:58.534 --> 13:59.799
That may be my favorite thing

13:59.824 --> 14:01.511
- you've ever said.
- Mm.

14:02.391 --> 14:05.934
You know, I don't understand a
man who doesn't want a daughter.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.682
I kind of wish I had one.

14:08.044 --> 14:11.151
Well, you have a daughter-in-law.

14:12.943 --> 14:16.667
A daughter-in-law who can
whoop your ass in shootin'.

14:17.186 --> 14:20.264
Well, we'll see about
that, Bitch Cassidy.

14:22.223 --> 14:23.524
That's the other one I had.

14:23.526 --> 14:24.858
(laughs, unamused)

14:24.860 --> 14:26.215
(gunshot)

14:26.720 --> 14:27.962
Bull's-eye.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.008
Wow, this brings back memories.

14:35.838 --> 14:38.345
How old were you on our
last helicopter date?

14:38.370 --> 14:39.870
Nine, maybe?

14:39.895 --> 14:44.057
You seemed like this magical
man who could make things fly.

14:44.393 --> 14:47.454
And there you were in
that seat looking up at me,

14:47.984 --> 14:50.159
biggest eyes I'd ever seen.

14:50.586 --> 14:53.641
So sweet and small and...

14:54.388 --> 14:57.317
- How could you be dating a married man?
- Oh, here we go.

14:57.342 --> 14:59.051
Well, didn't I raise
you better than that?

14:59.076 --> 15:00.469
Apparently not.

15:02.418 --> 15:04.031
Look, what do you want me to do?

15:04.033 --> 15:05.656
End things with him right now?

15:05.681 --> 15:08.114
Not go to the Pearl Jam
concert? Not meet Eddie?

15:08.139 --> 15:09.339
Well...

15:10.385 --> 15:11.874
let's not be hasty.

15:15.001 --> 15:17.311
It's just that, Stell,
your choices in men...

15:17.313 --> 15:19.680
losers, druggies, guys named Hashtag...

15:19.682 --> 15:22.742
do you ever think any of this
through? I mean, look at how Shea

15:22.767 --> 15:24.523
- analyzes everything...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:24.548 --> 15:27.410
I'm the screwup, but perfect
Shea does everything right.

15:27.435 --> 15:30.872
- I bet you wish she was here right now.
- I do not wish she was here right now.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.097
- Well, that's unfortunate.
- Oh, my

15:32.114 --> 15:33.683
- God!
- Good Lord.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.964
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?

15:36.966 --> 15:39.292
I came here, but then I
felt dumb for coming here,

15:39.317 --> 15:42.603
so I hid, hoping to come up
with a plan to leave unnoticed.

15:42.605 --> 15:46.399
But then you started talking about
me, and, well, now you're up to speed.

15:47.109 --> 15:49.509
But why did you come
here in the first place?

15:49.534 --> 15:50.962
It's too embarrassing.

15:50.987 --> 15:53.347
Oh, this can't still be
whether to text that guy.

15:53.349 --> 15:56.036
Of course not. But I should, right?

15:57.656 --> 16:00.344
Oh, my God. Even your
problems are adorable.

16:00.369 --> 16:03.691
Well, they're certainly more adorable
than sleeping with a married man.

16:03.693 --> 16:06.411
You know what? Why don't you
and Shea just go to the concert.

16:06.436 --> 16:08.075
It's probably what you wanted.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.564
Just admit it. You
like her better than me.

16:10.566 --> 16:13.233
Just stop that. I do
not like Shea better.

16:13.258 --> 16:14.537
Yes, you do.

16:15.971 --> 16:17.889
But not in the way you think.

16:18.007 --> 16:21.555
It just appears that Mom and Dad
like me better because I'm no trouble.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.807
But you're brave,

16:23.832 --> 16:27.689
and brave people make more
mistakes and get into more trouble.

16:27.714 --> 16:30.018
But I admire your fearlessness.

16:30.219 --> 16:33.637
People like you wouldn't waste a
whole day scared to send a text.

16:33.870 --> 16:35.296
Thank you, Shea.

16:35.321 --> 16:36.557
So I should send it?

16:36.559 --> 16:38.616
- (both) No.
- Okay, okay.

16:39.946 --> 16:41.146
There.

16:44.165 --> 16:46.767
Oh, Stella, how could you
think I love Shea more than you?

16:46.769 --> 16:48.469
You call her "the good one."

16:48.471 --> 16:50.537
(scoffs) It's practically her nickname.

16:50.539 --> 16:53.885
Well, look, it's hard not to
give extra points to the easy one.

16:53.910 --> 16:56.364
But, ah, Shea's right.

16:56.530 --> 16:57.946
You're brave.

16:58.247 --> 16:59.625
And that's great.

16:59.749 --> 17:01.666
But it scares me.

17:01.849 --> 17:03.717
Now, when you were little,
I could protect you,

17:03.719 --> 17:06.730
but when you became a
teenager, everything changed.

17:06.755 --> 17:07.954
Why?

17:07.980 --> 17:10.233
Well, the way you looked,
the way you dressed,

17:10.265 --> 17:13.093
all those boys grabbing
at you like horny zombies.

17:13.095 --> 17:14.539
Yeah. Good times.

17:15.830 --> 17:18.224
I mean, that must
have been hard for you.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.549
It was,

17:19.574 --> 17:23.159
and, ah, maybe I pulled
back from you a little bit.

17:23.487 --> 17:25.596
Yeah, maybe I did, too.

17:25.621 --> 17:27.153
Well, I'm sorry.

17:27.309 --> 17:29.443
And it's something that we can work on.

17:29.445 --> 17:30.790
I'd like that.

17:32.183 --> 17:36.917
Look, Stell, I don't like either one
of you best, but I did love you first.

17:38.286 --> 17:41.790
And don't tell your sister, but
that will always make you special.

17:41.924 --> 17:43.620
Aw, Dad.

17:43.893 --> 17:45.726
Just don't date married men.

17:45.751 --> 17:48.616
Brave, I'll acknowledge,
but stupid, I put a stop to.

17:49.266 --> 17:51.284
Okay. I hear you.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.151
I will break up with him.

17:53.922 --> 17:55.461
But what about the concert?

17:55.787 --> 17:58.022
There are more important
things than getting to hang out

17:58.047 --> 17:59.645
(struggles to say) with Pearl Jam.

18:00.009 --> 18:01.684
Wow, Dad.

18:02.411 --> 18:03.759
I have an idea.

18:03.784 --> 18:07.529
How about we go to the concert
and I break up with him after?

18:08.252 --> 18:09.721
I like that plan.

18:09.729 --> 18:10.929
(laughs)

18:10.947 --> 18:13.896
- Who says Shea's the smart one?
- Not me.

18:13.921 --> 18:15.275
She's not here, right?

18:15.576 --> 18:18.017
<i>♪</i>

18:18.505 --> 18:21.629
<i>♪</i>

18:21.654 --> 18:23.610
Best Daddy-Stella date ever.

18:23.635 --> 18:26.431
- (yelling) What an amazing night!
- Where were your seats?

18:26.456 --> 18:28.288
(yelling) Right next to the speakers.

18:28.354 --> 18:31.077
So close, when Eddie spit
out his gum, I caught it.

18:33.057 --> 18:35.006
Is that the gum you're chewing now?

18:36.708 --> 18:38.042
No.

18:40.131 --> 18:44.158
Shea, I'm sorry that Nate didn't
text you, but you should be proud.

18:44.183 --> 18:46.857
You got through the whole
day without texting him.

18:47.247 --> 18:50.136
Yeah, about that... I thought to myself,

18:50.161 --> 18:51.884
- "What would Stella do?"
- (scoffs)

18:51.909 --> 18:54.637
(yelling) How many times do I have
to tell you? I'm not a role model.

18:54.662 --> 18:56.699
Look somewhere else for your heroes.

18:59.217 --> 19:01.690
I tried to be brave, so I texted him.

19:01.787 --> 19:03.787
And he hasn't texted me back.

19:03.812 --> 19:07.630
So here I am: a sad,
lonely little breadstick.

19:09.294 --> 19:11.528
- Good-bye, Nate Johnson.
- Aw.

19:11.530 --> 19:13.428
Bummer. Your only option now

19:13.453 --> 19:16.934
is to pretend you died and
re-meet him as your twin sister.

19:22.847 --> 19:24.047
Shea!

19:24.616 --> 19:25.834
Nate?

19:26.545 --> 19:28.078
I'm so glad I found you.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.965
You are? This sounds promising. Go on.

19:31.547 --> 19:33.245
Hey, look, I know you
think of Nate Johnson

19:33.270 --> 19:35.852
as this bad boy who
plays by his own rules.

19:35.854 --> 19:38.619
You know, the guy who flipped the
script on the astrophysics game.

19:38.857 --> 19:40.457
Of course I think that.

19:40.459 --> 19:43.329
Why do you think I broke my rules
and slept with you on our eighth date?

19:44.295 --> 19:47.731
Well, look. The thing is, I wanted
to text you or call you all day.

19:47.733 --> 19:52.042
You know, or send flowers, or
fruit, or mini muffins, or something.

19:52.705 --> 19:55.487
You know, to thank you
for all the stuff you did.

19:57.809 --> 19:59.226
So, I did well?

19:59.251 --> 20:02.041
I thought so. I'm very task-oriented.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.980
What do you think they're talking about?

20:06.005 --> 20:08.426
Shea just said she's good at doing it.

20:12.364 --> 20:14.164
So, my friend took my phone away,

20:14.166 --> 20:17.312
'cause he was scared that you'd be
turned off if I contacted you too soon.

20:17.337 --> 20:19.177
I wanted to text you all day, too.

20:19.666 --> 20:23.124
So, if you could've texted
me, what would've you said?

20:23.275 --> 20:24.663
That I missed you.

20:24.688 --> 20:26.290
I couldn't wait to see you again.

20:26.455 --> 20:28.744
Look, Shea, I'm just an astrophysicist,

20:28.746 --> 20:31.266
standing in front of
another astrophysicist...

20:31.950 --> 20:33.663
except I also have an MD.

20:34.438 --> 20:36.236
I'm just asking you to...

20:36.508 --> 20:37.887
like me, or whatever.

20:37.889 --> 20:39.692
That kind of fizzed
out at the end there.

20:39.860 --> 20:42.024
Oh, Nate. I do like you or whatever.

20:42.026 --> 20:43.492
(all) Aww.

20:43.494 --> 20:44.777
Privacy!

20:45.029 --> 20:46.496
