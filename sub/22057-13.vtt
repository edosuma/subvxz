say the same thing about you.

You believe him?

09:55.540 --> 09:57.500
Hell, I don’t know, man.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.250
Maybe he did,
maybe he didn’t,

09:59.250 --> 10:01.990
but I promised him
that we would look into this.

10:01.990 --> 10:03.910
And if looking into the evidence
of this guy’s case

10:03.910 --> 10:06.540
makes him put that gun down,
I think it’s worth it.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.990
Then we will. Hang tight.

10:08.990 --> 10:10.580
Okay. All right.

10:10.580 --> 10:11.160
All right.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.990
Okay, guys, listen to me.
I need you to go

10:12.990 --> 10:14.080
and get everything
HPD has on this case.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.950
We need to see if there’s any
truth to what Brad’s saying.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.120
Okay, on it. Let’s go.
Okay, thank you.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.540
Whoa, whoa. What, uh...
what are we doing?

10:19.540 --> 10:20.790
We’re doing
everything we can

10:20.790 --> 10:21.990
to get this guy
to stand down.

10:21.990 --> 10:23.200
That’s a very
dangerous precedent

10:23.200 --> 10:25.540
we’re setting by dealing
with this guy like this.

10:25.540 --> 10:26.370
Okay.
MAN: Commander McGarrett.

10:26.370 --> 10:30.160
Yes, sir.
I’m Detective Keegan with
the HPD Crisis Negotiation Unit.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.990
All right, what can I do
for you, Detective?

10:31.990 --> 10:34.370
I’m gonna work with my team
on getting your man out

10:34.370 --> 10:35.990
so we can take over
and hopefully

10:35.990 --> 10:36.790
get Mr. Woodward
to stand down.

10:36.790 --> 10:38.080
Appreciate that,
but that won’t be necessary.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.910
Captain Grover has
the situation under control.

10:39.910 --> 10:42.160
Besides, I think any kind
of transition right now

10:42.160 --> 10:43.160
could be detrimental.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.290
I know it’s
your instinct

10:44.290 --> 10:46.540
to take the lead
on this, Commander.

10:46.540 --> 10:47.120
This is what I do.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.000
I’ve been doing it
a long time.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.330
Captain Grover’s been
doing it a long time, too.

10:50.330 --> 10:52.200
Okay, he ran SWAT here,
ran SWAT in Chicago.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.950
He’s been trained to handle
situations just like this.

10:54.950 --> 10:56.080
Also, he was the
first responder.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.660
He was the first
person on the scene,

10:57.660 --> 10:59.750
and he’s establishing
a relationship.

10:59.750 --> 11:00.990
We’re not gonna
pull him off that.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.990
Establishing
a relationship?
That’s right.

11:02.990 --> 11:05.620
How long has the man
been holding a gun to his head

11:05.620 --> 11:07.040
while your guy’s been
establishing a relationship?

11:07.040 --> 11:08.370
Captain Grover
has got this guy talking.

11:08.370 --> 11:10.410
You and I both know
that’s the most important thing.

11:10.410 --> 11:13.120
He’s also just promised him
we’ll look into his case.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.700
Now, for all we know,
that could be the only thing

11:15.700 --> 11:17.830
stopping this guy
pulling the trigger.

11:17.830 --> 11:18.990
KEEGAN:
All right.

11:18.990 --> 11:20.660
You want the job, fine.

11:20.660 --> 11:22.000
If that man kills himself,

11:22.000 --> 11:25.910
you’re denying justice
for his wife and her family.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.370
♪ ♪

12:19.870 --> 12:22.700
How does this happen?

12:23.540 --> 12:25.540
GROVER:
I want you to think

12:25.540 --> 12:27.990
about all the people
that care about you,

12:27.990 --> 12:29.500
all the people
that love you.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.660
Because those
are the people

12:30.660 --> 12:32.580
you’re gonna hurt if
you do this thing.

12:32.580 --> 12:35.290
You got family,
people that love you.

12:35.290 --> 12:38.950
You don’t want to
leave them like this.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.330
They gotta live
with that.

12:42.660 --> 12:46.990
Maybe there’s someone else
who... who loves you.

12:46.990 --> 12:47.830
Maybe...

12:47.830 --> 12:50.120
maybe somebody
you’ve been seeing.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.120
There was nobody else.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.120
I loved my wife.
Okay, I’m glad.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.830
I’m glad to
hear that, man.

12:55.830 --> 12:57.160
Why don’t you tell
me about her.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.750
Tell me about your wife.
What’s her name?

12:59.750 --> 13:01.000
Tell me her name.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.540
Her name is Tracy.
Okay.

13:03.540 --> 13:06.120
Okay, let’s talk
about Tracy.

13:06.120 --> 13:06.990
All right, here it is--

13:06.990 --> 13:09.870
everything we got
on Brad and Tracy so far.

13:09.870 --> 13:10.830
Definitely looked like there was

13:10.830 --> 13:11.990
a struggle
the night that she died.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.990
So we have Noelani going over
the physical evidence

13:13.990 --> 13:16.950
to make sure that there was no
other DNA found on the vic.

13:16.950 --> 13:19.040
We also went through Brad’s
phone records, e-mails, texts.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.660
Nothing to indicate
there was an affair.

13:20.660 --> 13:23.700
What about bank records?
Yeah, we checked ’em.
Their finances were solid.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.990
Like, no life insurance
taken out on Tracy.

13:26.990 --> 13:28.120
What were they fighting about?
HPD know?

13:28.120 --> 13:29.000
JUNIOR:
No, but in the statement,

13:29.000 --> 13:31.790
he said that he left
straight after the argument

13:31.790 --> 13:34.120
and he wasn’t even there
when she died, so...

13:34.120 --> 13:35.200
but no one can corroborate that.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.500
TANI: So here’s the
interesting thing:

13:37.500 --> 13:39.870
Tracy sent Brad
multiple text messages

13:39.870 --> 13:43.660
that Brad deleted before HPD
got a hold of the phone.

13:43.660 --> 13:46.290
Also, Tracy placed
a number of calls to Brad

13:46.290 --> 13:47.290
that went unreturned.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.990
Well, clearly something
had Tracy upset.

13:48.990 --> 13:51.990
Yeah, and Brad didn’t want
anyone to know about it.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.290
So, if you
didn’t do it,

13:54.290 --> 13:56.910
something had to make
her jump, right?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.370
Don’t worry about them.
Don’t worry about them.

14:00.370 --> 14:01.990
It’s just you and me.
It’s just...

14:01.990 --> 14:03.370
Brad, Brad, look
at me, look at me.

14:03.370 --> 14:04.540
They’ll do whatever
I tell ’em.

14:04.540 --> 14:06.040
You want me to tell
’em to stay back?

14:06.040 --> 14:07.160
Huh? Is that
what you want?
Back. Back.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.990
Okay, I’ll take care of it.
I’ll take care of it.
All of ’em.

14:09.990 --> 14:11.500
I got you.
Hold on a second.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.910
Everybody, get back!

14:13.910 --> 14:15.990
Brad wants everybody back!

14:15.990 --> 14:18.370
Everybody back!

14:22.990 --> 14:23.990
Okay.

14:23.990 --> 14:24.990
See that?
They’re all back.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.870
Let’s forget all about them.
It’s just you and me.

14:27.870 --> 14:30.410
Just you and me, okay?

14:30.410 --> 14:33.160
So...

14:33.990 --> 14:36.990
Let’s talk about Tracy.

14:36.990 --> 14:39.870
How long were you
guys married?

14:41.700 --> 14:42.750
Ten years.

14:42.750 --> 14:43.910
Yeah, I’ve been
married almost 25.

14:43.910 --> 14:47.990
I’m telling you, you have your
ups and downs in marriage.

14:47.990 --> 14:48.910
Marriage is...

14:48.910 --> 14:50.870
I don’t want
to talk about this.

14:50.870 --> 14:52.450
I just want this to be over.

14:52.450 --> 14:55.910
I know that suicide
is not a rehearsal

14:55.910 --> 14:56.990
and death is final.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.040
You pull that trigger...

14:58.040 --> 14:59.990
and there’s no
rewind, man.

14:59.990 --> 15:03.370
You will have thrown
away your whole life

15:03.370 --> 15:05.660
in one split-second mistake.

15:05.660 --> 15:07.990
You understand?
You just lose everything.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.000
Everything goes black.

15:09.000 --> 15:09.990
I don’t have anything anymore!

15:09.990 --> 15:11.250
Don’t say that.
That’s not true.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.160
That’s not true.
That’s not true.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.250
I know you’re
scared, Brad.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.790
And you know what?

15:17.790 --> 15:20.990
I’m done asking you
to put away your gun.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.450
Okay? Don’t...

15:22.450 --> 15:24.990
I’m gonna put my gun away.

15:25.990 --> 15:28.200
I don’t like
where this is going.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.990
I got nothing now.

15:29.990 --> 15:30.990
Okay?

15:30.990 --> 15:33.990
I just want us to talk.

15:33.990 --> 15:35.370
I put my gun away,

15:35.370 --> 15:36.870
and we can just talk.

15:36.870 --> 15:38.200
Can’t we just talk, man?

15:38.200 --> 15:41.660
Why don’t you let me get
in the car with you?

15:42.750 --> 15:45.120
That’s the biggest mistake
he can make.

15:45.120 --> 15:48.290
Isolating yourself
with a subject who’s armed?

15:48.290 --> 15:51.580
He’s practically signing
his own death warrant.

15:51.580 --> 15:52.990
Captain Grover knows
what he’s doing.

15:52.990 --> 15:54.990
If he thinks this
is the only way,

15:54.990 --> 15:56.990
we follow his lead.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.330
Who were you trying
to convince just now?

16:06.580 --> 16:08.120
Look, when Lou was
running SWAT in Chicago,

16:08.120 --> 16:10.700
he had a situation that
was similar to this one.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.990
He was called
to a house

16:11.990 --> 16:13.750
that he’d responded to before.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.990
But this time
with a suicidal gunman

16:15.990 --> 16:17.870
holding his
two-year-old son inside.

16:17.870 --> 16:20.120
I know... I know
for a fact that...

16:20.120 --> 16:21.750
Lou wishes he handled
it differently.

16:21.750 --> 16:24.370
He feels like he made
a mistake that night.

16:24.370 --> 16:26.950
What happened?
The guy killed himself

16:26.950 --> 16:30.790
while he was still
on the phone with Grover.

16:33.990 --> 16:36.750
And what happened to the son?

16:45.990 --> 16:47.000
Brad...

16:47.000 --> 16:49.620
I’ve been a cop
a long time.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.990
I’ve known a lot
of guilty men.

16:51.990 --> 16:56.660
And I know what a guilty man
looks like, and that ain’t you.

16:56.830 --> 17:00.120
You’re just telling me
what you think I want to hear.

17:01.660 --> 17:04.000
You don’t believe me.

17:04.410 --> 17:06.370
You just want me
to put the gun down.

17:06.370 --> 17:08.620
You want me to keep
it real with you?

17:08.620 --> 17:09.990
Okay, I’ll tell
you the truth.

17:09.990 --> 17:12.000
When I first came over
here to talk to you,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.200
that’s exactly
what I wanted.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.870
I didn’t give a
damn about you.

17:14.870 --> 17:16.990
I just wanted you to
get out of the car,

17:16.990 --> 17:18.990
get out here and
get on your knees.

17:18.990 --> 17:20.870
And look at us now.

17:20.990 --> 17:24.200
I got nothing
in my hand.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.500
My gun is on my belt

17:25.500 --> 17:27.990
because I’ve been
doing this long enough

17:27.990 --> 17:31.330
to know when I’m talking
to an innocent man.

17:31.330 --> 17:33.830
Brad, please.

17:35.830 --> 17:38.700
Let me come in there
with you, buddy.

17:38.700 --> 17:39.330
Okay?

17:39.330 --> 17:42.660
If you take your life, you
take the truth with you,

17:42.660 --> 17:45.250
and-and I don’t want
that to happen to you.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.750
And Tracy and
your family

17:47.750 --> 17:50.160
and your friends
and your loved ones.

17:50.160 --> 17:50.990
They don’t deserve that.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.990
Everybody deserves to know
what really happened.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.370
Don’t take
that with you.

17:56.370 --> 18:00.080
Can I come in
there with you?

18:01.200 --> 18:06.410
I’m gonna take your
silence as a yes.

18:07.830 --> 18:09.160
TANI:
Guys, that was Noelani.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.660
She confirmed that Tracy
had defensive bruising

18:11.660 --> 18:13.250
on her wrists,
her right shoulder,

18:13.250 --> 18:14.410
and DNA under her fingernails.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.990
So she most likely
fought off her attacker.

18:16.990 --> 18:18.950
Yeah.
DNA was Brad’s?

18:18.950 --> 18:19.910
Mm-hmm.
He was the only hit.

18:19.910 --> 18:22.000
They got enough evidence
to lock this guy up

18:22.000 --> 18:23.990
for the rest
of his life.

18:28.990 --> 18:30.950
What is he doing?

18:32.990 --> 18:35.410
Lou, answer your phone.
Answer your phone.

18:35.410 --> 18:37.080
He’s not answering his phone.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.830
You’re gonna get through this,

18:38.830 --> 18:40.580
and I’m gonna help you, okay?

18:40.580 --> 18:43.990
And I just want to talk.

18:44.370 --> 18:46.990
I’m coming in now, okay?

18:46.990 --> 18:48.990
Okay.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.000
Lou...

18:58.000 --> 19:00.500
The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.000
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures;

19:04.000 --> 19:07.540
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

19:07.540 --> 19:09.620
He restoreth my soul;

19:09.620 --> 19:12.790
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness

19:12.790 --> 19:14.790
for His name’s sake.

19:14.790 --> 19:16.370
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

19:16.370 --> 19:19.910
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil;

19:19.910 --> 19:23.490
for Thou art with me;
Thy rod and Thy staff...

19:23.490 --> 19:25.500
BRAD:My wife’s family,

19:25.500 --> 19:29.120
my friends,

19:29.120 --> 19:30.450
everyone we knew,

19:30.450 --> 19:35.700
they all looked at me
like I put her in that box.

19:36.330 --> 19:39.330
Press was there, too.

19:39.330 --> 19:41.620
And the cops.

19:42.620 --> 19:46.490
They were all watching
every move I made.

19:47.290 --> 19:49.580
Everybody came to
see the murderer.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.750
I knew nobody
wanted me there.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.540
But I had to go.

19:56.540 --> 19:59.330
That was my wife.

19:59.950 --> 20:02.490
I deserved the chance
to say good-bye.

20:02.490 --> 20:05.700
You had every right to be there.

20:08.410 --> 20:10.080
Brad... you know,
when people

20:10.080 --> 20:13.700
are in mourning, they-they’re
looking for answers.

20:13.700 --> 20:17.750
It’s part of
the grieving process, and...

20:17.750 --> 20:19.490
you know?

20:19.490 --> 20:23.200
But Tracy’s family, you know,
it-it’s just easier

20:23.200 --> 20:26.580
to point the finger at somebody,
point the finger at you,

20:26.580 --> 20:28.830
than to just walk away
with no answers.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.000
Why not look at me

20:30.000 --> 20:31.490
like the guy
that tried to save her?

20:31.490 --> 20:33.790
Why not look at me
like the guy that...

20:33.790 --> 20:34.790
that kept her safe?

20:34.790 --> 20:37.160
What do you mean,
"kept her safe"?

20:37.160 --> 20:38.200
Safe from what?

20:38.200 --> 20:40.490
From herself.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.200
Tracy had severe depression.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.490
Nobody else knew.

20:49.490 --> 20:51.500
Outside her family,
you mean.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.790
Nobody knew.
Nobody knew.

20:52.790 --> 20:53.870
Just me.
What?

20:53.870 --> 20:57.370
I guess I thought it was
gonna go away or something.

20:57.370 --> 21:00.450
: I guess I was
embarrassed to talk about it.

21:00.450 --> 21:01.000
I don’t know.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.490
She needed help,
and I didn’t give it to her.

21:09.990 --> 21:11.580
Is your man
getting anywhere?

21:11.580 --> 21:14.700
Uh, they’re talking
at the moment.

21:14.700 --> 21:15.990
Talking is good,

21:15.990 --> 21:18.410
but Captain Grover
gave up all his power

21:18.410 --> 21:20.200
the moment he stepped
into that car.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.990
The subject has leverage
and authority over us

21:22.990 --> 21:24.950
that he previously
didn’t have.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.870
Let’s just hope Brad doesn’t
get tired of talking

21:27.870 --> 21:28.830
and turns the gun on your man.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.250
Yeah, well, I got snipers in
position if that happens.

21:31.250 --> 21:34.080
Thank you for
your concern.

21:35.950 --> 21:37.990
So, building manager thinks
he may have seen Brad

21:37.990 --> 21:39.990
exit from this door the
night that Tracy died,

21:39.990 --> 21:41.540
but he couldn’t
give me a time.

21:41.540 --> 21:44.450
All right, well, that means
that Brad’s claim that he left

21:44.450 --> 21:45.410
is still unsubstantiated.

21:45.410 --> 21:47.500
Yeah. Meanwhile, none of the
neighbors that I spoke to

21:47.500 --> 21:48.790
knew what they were
fighting about.

21:48.790 --> 21:51.410
Yeah, I know. The ones I
spoke to, it was the same thing.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.990
Like, neighbors minding
their own business?

21:52.990 --> 21:53.990
I mean, that’s gotta

21:53.990 --> 21:55.700
be a first, right?

21:55.700 --> 21:56.990
What?

21:56.990 --> 21:59.160
What are you looking at?

21:59.410 --> 22:02.990
I might have found a witness
that saw Brad leave.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.990
Well, let’s hope this camera
caught something.

22:37.410 --> 22:39.000
Sir?

22:39.000 --> 22:40.160
Sir.

22:40.160 --> 22:42.750
Gun!

22:45.330 --> 22:46.200
Stop!

22:46.200 --> 22:48.830
I’ll break your shoulder.
You understand?

22:48.830 --> 22:50.540
You’re trying to save him?

22:50.540 --> 22:51.990
After what
that bastard

22:51.990 --> 22:53.410
did to my daughter.

22:53.410 --> 22:54.700
He should die
for what he did.

22:54.700 --> 22:56.830
If he’s not gonna pull
the trigger himself...

22:56.830 --> 22:58.580
Then what
You

22:58.580 --> 22:59.990
Huh? Where’d you
get that gun?

22:59.990 --> 23:01.620
It’s mine.

23:01.620 --> 23:03.540
I have a concealed-weapons
permit.

23:03.540 --> 23:05.290
Not anymore.

23:05.290 --> 23:06.330
It’s Tracy’s father.

23:06.330 --> 23:08.990
I’m gonna let you go.
You gonna behave yourself?

23:09.660 --> 23:11.160
Are you gonna
behave yourself?

23:11.160 --> 23:12.950
Yes.

23:12.950 --> 23:15.040
Easy, easy, easy.

23:15.040 --> 23:18.330
Turn around.
Turn around.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.910
What’s your name?

23:19.910 --> 23:21.540
John.
John?

23:21.540 --> 23:23.080
Look at me, John.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.990
I’m Steve, all right, John?

23:24.990 --> 23:26.500
You gotta let me do my job.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.990
DANNY: John, listen to me.
I

23:28.990 --> 23:30.540
I cannot imagine
what you’ve been through.

23:30.540 --> 23:33.910
All right, but if you want this
guy to get what he deserves,

23:33.910 --> 23:35.910
you need to let us
get him into custody.

23:35.910 --> 23:37.950
STEVE: John, you gotta
trust us, all right?

23:37.950 --> 23:38.500
This is what we do.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.410
You need to go home
and be with your family.

23:40.410 --> 23:42.990
No, my family needs
me here right now.

23:42.990 --> 23:45.990
My daughter needs me here.

23:45.990 --> 23:48.080
I’m not leaving.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.410
All right, Duke,
he can stay

23:52.410 --> 23:54.410
under your supervision,
all right? Go with Duke.

23:54.410 --> 23:57.990
Come on, John.
Go on. Go on.

24:03.160 --> 24:06.620
I don’t know why
I left that night.

24:06.990 --> 24:10.870
Guess I just needed
to get out of there.

24:11.410 --> 24:13.990
You don’t understand,
the mood swings, man--

24:13.990 --> 24:17.160
they happened every single day.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.620
Sometimes I thought
I would go crazy

24:20.620 --> 24:21.500
if I didn’t get out of there.

24:21.500 --> 24:26.660
But, Brad, why didn’t you try
to get her professional help?

24:27.410 --> 24:29.290
I tried.

24:30.990 --> 24:33.830
Just got tired of asking.

24:35.870 --> 24:37.660
I should have
insisted.

24:37.660 --> 24:40.450
That’s where I failed.

24:41.910 --> 24:42.750
Brad.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.910
Stay with me,
now, Brad.

24:44.910 --> 24:46.870
Brad, stay with me.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.160
You and me are walking
out of here.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.910
There’s more life
ahead for you.

24:55.910 --> 24:58.830
You’ll have
your day in court.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.540
You’ll be able
to tell your story,

25:00.540 --> 25:03.750
your side of things,
and be heard.

25:04.790 --> 25:06.250
It’s too late.

25:06.250 --> 25:08.290
Don’t say that.

25:12.990 --> 25:15.200
It’s too late, man.

25:28.290 --> 25:29.620
Looks like he’s losing him.

25:29.620 --> 25:30.200
Steve.
Yeah?

25:30.200 --> 25:32.040
Both snipers say
they have a clean shot.

25:32.040 --> 25:34.250
We can end this
on your command.

25:35.330 --> 25:37.990
Snipers, go weapons hot.

25:41.990 --> 25:42.990
It’s Lou.

25:42.990 --> 25:44.620
Yeah, Lou, you okay in there?

25:44.620 --> 25:45.620
Yeah, we’re good.

25:45.620 --> 25:47.450
We’re good.
There’s, uh...

25:47.450 --> 25:49.120
one problem-- we’re hungry.

25:49.120 --> 25:52.330
Why don’t you get us
a couple of pizzas.

25:53.160 --> 25:53.910
You say pizzas?

25:53.910 --> 25:55.500
Yeah, man. We’re thinking JJ’s.

25:55.500 --> 25:59.370
How about a-a pepperoni
and sausage

25:59.370 --> 26:01.250
and one pineapple and cheese.

26:01.250 --> 26:03.410
I’ll take care of that,
but listen, I think it’s time

26:03.410 --> 26:05.000
to pull you out of there, pal.

26:05.000 --> 26:05.910
Is that right?

26:05.910 --> 26:08.500
Yeah, Noelani found defensive
bruising on the victim.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.950
DNA matches Brad’s.

26:10.950 --> 26:13.080
If you’re not getting anywhere,
I gotta make a call.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.290
Yeah, well...
that sounds tempting,

26:15.290 --> 26:17.620
but I don’t think we need
any calamari.

26:17.620 --> 26:19.290
The pizzas will be enough.

26:19.290 --> 26:22.160
Hey, hey, don’t forget
the pineapple, okay?

26:22.160 --> 26:23.540
I’ll do that.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.410
All right.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.080
Sniper teams, stand by.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.200
All teams, stand by.

26:29.700 --> 26:32.200
Why you doing this for me?

26:32.200 --> 26:33.540
The truth is, Brad,

26:33.540 --> 26:35.910
I’ve been where you are.

26:35.910 --> 26:37.990
So I know that...

26:37.990 --> 26:39.160
when you’re feeling like this,

26:39.160 --> 26:42.120
the most important thing
in the world is to have

26:42.120 --> 26:45.080
somebody in your corner.

27:23.990 --> 27:24.500
Hey.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.040
GROVER:When someone’s hurting...

27:27.040 --> 27:29.000
Give me another one.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.990
When you’re suffering...

27:33.660 --> 27:37.040
...it also affects
the people that love you.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.870
They suffer, too.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.990
Lou?

27:46.990 --> 27:48.290
Lou, open the door.

27:48.290 --> 27:48.990
Lou, let...

27:48.990 --> 27:51.080
Open this door.
Why is it locked, baby?

27:51.080 --> 27:52.950
Lou, baby, come on.
Let’s talk.

27:52.950 --> 27:54.990
We never talk anymore.
Can’t open my safe.

27:54.990 --> 27:57.370
No, baby, I didn’t do anything
to the safe.

27:57.370 --> 27:59.160
Come on, honey. Open this door.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.120
You changed my safe, Renee!

28:01.120 --> 28:04.040
I didn’t change
anything.
Yes, you did!

28:04.040 --> 28:06.790
Baby, I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

28:06.790 --> 28:08.330
Open the door, honey.
Yes, you did!

28:08.330 --> 28:10.580
Please. Baby, you’re scaring me.
Please...

28:10.580 --> 28:12.540
I want to get
in my safe!

28:12.540 --> 28:15.000
Baby, open the door,
open the door.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.290
Baby, we got kids upstairs.

28:16.290 --> 28:19.330
All they want to do is see
their dad in the morning, baby.

28:19.330 --> 28:22.910
Baby, why are you crying?

28:27.870 --> 28:28.830
You know, Brad, I believe you

28:28.830 --> 28:32.370
when you said you really tried
to help your wife.

28:33.580 --> 28:34.990
I believe you.

28:34.990 --> 28:37.700
Brad...

28:39.580 --> 28:42.290
What really happened that night?

28:43.250 --> 28:45.330
BRAD :
I messed up.

28:45.330 --> 28:46.370
That’s what happened.

28:46.370 --> 28:49.410
GROVER: Why don’t you
walk me through it?

28:49.410 --> 28:51.410
Just start at the beginning.

28:51.750 --> 28:54.950
And tell me everything
that happened that day.

28:54.950 --> 28:57.540
Food’s here, Steve.

28:57.540 --> 28:59.990
Okay, I’ll walk it over.

28:59.990 --> 29:00.830
You sure?
Yeah.

29:00.830 --> 29:02.330
Don’t tell me
that’s for him.

29:02.330 --> 29:04.830
You’re kidding me.
You’re gonna feed him?

29:04.830 --> 29:06.620
He’s not the victim here.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.040
Hey, hey, hey, hey, John,
just take it easy.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.700
He doesn’t deserve
your kindness.
John, I know
how this must feel.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.250
Okay?
Oh, do you?

29:13.250 --> 29:13.990
Really?

29:13.990 --> 29:15.990
He kills Tracy, and
then he gives everyone

29:15.990 --> 29:18.290
some bull about
how she jumped?

29:18.290 --> 29:19.450
That was my daughter.

29:19.450 --> 29:20.250
If there was
something wrong,

29:20.250 --> 29:22.790
don’t you think I
would have known?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.990
So I get out of my meeting,
and I check my phone,

29:26.990 --> 29:29.790
and she left me
four messages.

29:29.950 --> 29:34.750
I didn’t have to listen to them
to know what was going on.

29:34.750 --> 29:36.410
She had done this before.

29:36.410 --> 29:37.990
So I race home,
and there’s Tracy.

29:37.990 --> 29:41.500
She’s... she’s hysterical
and screaming.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.290
She found a bottle
of my sleeping pills

29:43.290 --> 29:46.160
that I hid in my luggage
for long flights.

29:47.330 --> 29:51.580
Said it wouldn’t hurt at all
if she just took them all.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.000
No, no, let me go!
Hey, hey.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.990
Please let me... Please!
Hey, hey. Hey.

29:54.990 --> 29:56.410
Hey, hey.

29:56.870 --> 29:58.950
You’re not doing this.

29:58.950 --> 29:59.540
Get off!

29:59.540 --> 30:02.450
She’s scratching me,
and she’s screaming

30:02.450 --> 30:04.250
to let her go.

30:08.990 --> 30:10.000
It’s the kids.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.580
Yeah, what do you got, Tani?
TANI: Brad didn’t do it.

30:12.580 --> 30:14.990
He was out of the
building before she fell.

30:14.990 --> 30:17.330
There’s no way that he
could have pushed her.

30:17.330 --> 30:18.830
You sure about that?

30:18.830 --> 30:19.450
Yeah, we pulled footage

30:19.450 --> 30:21.910
from an ATM camera
across the street.

30:21.910 --> 30:22.870
It shows Brad leaving,

30:22.870 --> 30:25.990
getting into a car,
and the time stamp

30:25.990 --> 30:29.410
proves that he was out
of the building before she died.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.990
Brad’s telling the truth.
She jumped.

30:32.990 --> 30:35.660
All right, copy that.
Thank you.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.750
All right,
I’m going over.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.120
Just be careful.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.250
I will.

30:44.290 --> 30:45.700
SWAT teams.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.040
SWAT, moving in.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.450
She just keeps hitting me,
and...

31:03.750 --> 31:04.290
Tell him to stop.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.200
Brad, Brad, that’s just...
I don’t want him coming closer.

31:06.200 --> 31:07.700
That’s just the pizza.
Tell him to get back!

31:07.700 --> 31:09.450
That’s just the pizza.
Tell him to get back, Lou.

31:09.450 --> 31:10.990
All right, I-I got it.
Okay, I got you.
Lou.

31:10.990 --> 31:12.990
Tell him to get back!
I got you. All right.

31:12.990 --> 31:14.120
I’m dialing him now.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.910
I got you.
Hold on.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.990
John. John!

31:25.540 --> 31:27.660
LUKELA:
John, stop it! John!

31:35.410 --> 31:37.160
Lou!

31:39.660 --> 31:40.750
GROVER: Brad?
Lou!
Stop!

31:40.750 --> 31:42.830
Okay. I’m fine.
I’m not hit.
Stop! Get back!

31:42.830 --> 31:44.870
We need the paramedics, Steve.
He’s hit.

31:44.870 --> 31:45.660
We need to get some paramedics.

31:45.660 --> 31:47.500
EMS. EMS right here,
right now. Come on.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.120
Let me see, Brad.
Let me see.
No! No!

31:49.120 --> 31:50.080
Brad, you’re hurt.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.870
Brad, we know you didn’t do it.

31:51.870 --> 31:52.990
We know you
didn’t hurt Tracy.

31:52.990 --> 31:53.830
You don’t know anything.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.620
Yeah, we do. We got proof.
Lou, he’s telling the truth.

31:55.620 --> 31:57.990
We got proof.
Listen, didn’t I tell you
we were gonna get out of here?

31:57.990 --> 32:01.660
You hear that? Everybody here
knows you’re innocent, Brad.

32:01.660 --> 32:03.990
I’m not!
You don’t understand.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.990
It’s my fault.

32:05.990 --> 32:08.790
I couldn’t take it anymore.

32:08.790 --> 32:10.660
The constant threats.

32:10.660 --> 32:14.370
Worrying about
what she’d do to herself.

32:14.370 --> 32:16.990
Not knowing how to help her.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.500
I tried.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.580
I tried so hard.

32:24.580 --> 32:26.990
But nothing I did
mattered.

32:28.370 --> 32:30.200
I was done.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.990
You know?

32:31.990 --> 32:33.620
I was done fighting
for her.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.950
I was done
fighting for us.

32:35.950 --> 32:38.540
I told her,
"Go ahead and do it.

32:38.540 --> 32:39.990
Go ahead."

32:39.990 --> 32:44.370
I didn’t have the strength
to stop her, you know?

32:44.370 --> 32:46.200
Brad, no!

32:46.200 --> 32:48.790
I killed her.
No! No, Brad. Brad, wait.

32:48.790 --> 32:50.450
I killed her.
Brad, wait!

32:50.450 --> 32:51.250
Wait, wait. Stop.

32:51.250 --> 32:54.160
Please, Brad.
Get out, Brad!
Please just get out!

32:54.160 --> 32:56.330
Get out!
Damn it, if you really
want to do this,

32:56.330 --> 32:58.160
I can’t do
a damn thing about it,

32:58.160 --> 32:59.580
but before you do
anything else,

32:59.580 --> 33:02.410
please, for God’s sake,
Brad, just listen to me.

33:02.410 --> 33:04.120
Just listen to me, okay?

33:04.120 --> 33:08.410
I got one more thing
to say, okay?

33:08.410 --> 33:10.250
Just listen.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.660
RENEE:
All right.

33:11.660 --> 33:13.410
The kids are off
to school,

33:13.410 --> 33:17.250
and I’m gonna do a grocery run.

33:17.250 --> 33:17.990
You want anything?

33:17.990 --> 33:21.790
No, sweetheart. You don’t have
to get me anything.

33:21.790 --> 33:22.830
Really?

33:22.830 --> 33:23.330
Mmm, all right.

33:23.330 --> 33:26.290
Well, then I guess it’s all
green vegetables.

33:27.660 --> 33:29.990
Nene.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.660
Baby, you haven’t
called me that in years.

33:36.990 --> 33:38.830
Hey.

33:39.160 --> 33:42.120
What’s going on, sweetheart?

33:43.990 --> 33:46.450
Nene, I love you.

33:54.990 --> 33:58.290
I love you, too, baby.

33:59.250 --> 34:01.290
You be careful, now.

34:01.830 --> 34:04.580
You’re so silly.

34:05.450 --> 34:06.950
All right.

34:06.950 --> 34:09.870
I’ll see you later.

36:05.910 --> 36:09.330
I thought you were supposed
to be at school.

36:13.120 --> 36:17.160
Brad, these days,
I like to tell myself that...

36:17.160 --> 36:19.410
if my son wouldn’t
have cut school that day,

36:19.410 --> 36:21.990
that I wouldn’t have gone
through with it, but...

36:21.990 --> 36:24.750
listening to you today...

36:26.200 --> 36:27.990
I remember...

36:27.990 --> 36:30.620
how that hurt felt.

36:30.620 --> 36:35.410
That hurt and that pain, and...

36:35.410 --> 36:37.950
I just wanted it to end, and...

36:37.950 --> 36:43.160
I thought that there was
no other way to make it stop.

36:43.160 --> 36:47.410
And then I could find peace.

36:47.410 --> 36:48.990
Just like you.

36:48.990 --> 36:52.200
Your guilt
can consume you, man.

36:52.200 --> 36:55.290
I know that you’ve
been reliving this thing

36:55.290 --> 36:58.990
over and over,
and you see Tracy

36:58.990 --> 37:00.290
everywhere you look.

37:00.290 --> 37:02.990
I know that because,
when this happened to me,

37:02.990 --> 37:07.990
I couldn’t look at my son Will
and not see Christian,

37:07.990 --> 37:12.990
that little boy who never
had a chance at life

37:12.990 --> 37:15.990
because I failed him.

37:16.830 --> 37:19.620
And I didn’t save him.

37:21.250 --> 37:24.080
And you think
that it’s not fair,

37:24.080 --> 37:29.080
it’s not fair that you
get to keep living.

37:30.660 --> 37:33.000
But you do.

37:33.410 --> 37:38.160
But because my boy
came home that day,

37:38.160 --> 37:39.620
I made it through that day.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.330
And you know
what happened after that?

37:42.330 --> 37:45.500
I made it through the next one

37:45.500 --> 37:49.700
and the one after that
and the one after that

37:49.700 --> 37:55.410
until eventually I found help.

37:55.910 --> 37:59.540
And with that help,
eventually...

37:59.540 --> 38:01.700
I found peace.

38:06.250 --> 38:08.700
It just...

38:09.990 --> 38:13.990
It just doesn’t
go away, man, but...

38:13.990 --> 38:18.540
you can learn to live with it.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.450
And, Brad, you’re never
gonna know what it’s like

38:22.450 --> 38:25.410
to be able to finally
be able to live with it

38:25.410 --> 38:28.990
unless you put
that gun down, man.

38:28.990 --> 38:32.580
If you put that gun down...

38:34.950 --> 38:36.700
I will help you.

38:36.700 --> 38:38.990
Because I know what it’s like,

38:38.990 --> 38:42.080
and if you just
put that gun down,

38:42.080 --> 38:44.830
I promise you
I will stay in touch with you,

38:44.830 --> 38:47.990
I will stay in touch with you,
and I will help you,

38:47.990 --> 38:50.990
but please just...

38:50.990 --> 38:53.540
just give me the gun.

38:54.950 --> 38:56.910
There you go.

39:01.410 --> 39:02.790

Come on.

39:29.990 --> 39:31.660
Yeah, I’m cool.

39:31.660 --> 39:33.200
I’m just tired.

39:34.910 --> 39:35.990
A long day.

39:35.990 --> 39:37.410
Look, um...

39:37.410 --> 39:40.080
