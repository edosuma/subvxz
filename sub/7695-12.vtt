WEBVTT

00:09.630 --> 00:13.804
Guess who I just got
off the phone with?

00:13.804 --> 00:16.187
Giselle Vickers.

00:16.187 --> 00:18.349
The big Hollywood
filmmaker?

00:18.349 --> 00:20.191
She is legendary!

00:20.191 --> 00:22.273
She made all the Killer
Zombie Trucker movies.

00:22.273 --> 00:24.605
Because of her,
I can't be at a truck stop.

00:26.277 --> 00:28.319
That's right.
And get this.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.821
Her next blockbuster
is gonna be called

00:30.821 --> 00:32.913
Bionic Action Hero.

00:32.913 --> 00:34.785
Awesome!

00:34.785 --> 00:35.706
What's it about?

00:35.706 --> 00:39.540
A bionic action hero.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.583
Huh. Save your money.
It sounds like a flop.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.546
The best part,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.718
it's based on
you guys.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.550
( all exclaiming )

00:49.550 --> 00:51.302
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.674
The same person that makes
those lame zombie movies

00:53.674 --> 00:55.226
is gonna make our movie?

00:55.226 --> 00:56.937
( scoffs )
No way.

00:56.937 --> 01:00.811
Must you ruin everything?

01:02.773 --> 01:04.735
Relax, Chase.

01:04.735 --> 01:06.897
Giselle's an old
college friend.

01:06.897 --> 01:10.531
We spent a lot of time
in the robotics lab together

01:10.531 --> 01:12.072
before she switched
careers.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.034
We even dated a bit.

01:14.034 --> 01:16.197
What happened?

01:16.197 --> 01:17.788
Sometimes people
grow apart.

01:17.788 --> 01:19.079
She dumped you,
didn't she?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.911
Worst day of my life!

01:22.203 --> 01:25.045
And I've been to
prison four times.

01:26.917 --> 01:31.632
Anyway, she wants the film
to portray bionics accurately,

01:31.632 --> 01:34.054
so she's coming here

01:34.054 --> 01:36.517
to research with the actor
that's playing you guys.

01:36.517 --> 01:39.270
I think you mean actors.

01:39.270 --> 01:43.434
No. In the film, there aren't
three bionic superheroes.

01:43.434 --> 01:45.146
To simplify it,
there's just one

01:45.146 --> 01:46.857
with all of
your abilities.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.028
So who's the actor?

01:48.028 --> 01:50.731
Ooh, I bet it's
Dame Judi Dench.

01:50.731 --> 01:52.112
( bad British accent )
Look at me.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.114
I'm bionic.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.036
No.

01:56.036 --> 01:58.949
It's some new
up-and-comer named Troy West.

01:58.949 --> 02:01.872
So they're just gonna
throw some rookie
in the leading role?

02:01.872 --> 02:04.044
I don't want
any part of this.

02:05.246 --> 02:07.378
I hate to say it,

02:07.378 --> 02:09.008
but I agree with Chase.

02:09.008 --> 02:10.751
You only have one chance
to have your life

02:10.751 --> 02:12.633
turned into a movie.
It should be done right.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.215
Exactly.

02:14.215 --> 02:15.806
So who's playing me?

02:15.806 --> 02:18.679
Denzel, Will Smith?

02:18.679 --> 02:20.431
Oh, who am I kidding?

02:20.431 --> 02:22.853
Those guys can't bring
the Dooley.

02:22.853 --> 02:24.765
Sorry, Leo.

02:24.765 --> 02:26.857
There is no character
based on you.

02:26.857 --> 02:28.899
What?

02:28.899 --> 02:31.232
It's called
 Bionic Action Hero,

02:31.232 --> 02:34.825
not Kind Of Bionic
Sort Of Action Hero.

02:36.827 --> 02:38.949
Look, if they want someone
to play a bionic hero,

02:38.949 --> 02:40.581
why don't they use me?

02:40.581 --> 02:41.832
I'm an actor.

02:41.832 --> 02:43.454
I starred in
a school play.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.246
You had one line.

02:45.246 --> 02:46.877
And you forgot it.

02:46.877 --> 02:48.999
Just because it's
in the script

02:48.999 --> 02:51.001
doesn't mean
you have to say it.

02:51.001 --> 02:53.424
Plus, I can do
my own stunts.

02:53.424 --> 02:55.846
The guy who played Superman
can't stop a real locomotive,

02:55.846 --> 02:58.098
but I can.

02:58.098 --> 03:00.010
Oh, yeah? Well,
the hydra loop is closing.

03:00.010 --> 03:02.303
I bet you can't
stop that.

03:04.725 --> 03:06.977
Hah! I did it.

03:06.977 --> 03:09.360
Uh-uh. You stopped
the doors,

03:09.360 --> 03:11.151
but you didn't stop
the hydra loop.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.409
Did it stop?

03:20.701 --> 03:23.874
The world's first
bionic superhumans...

03:23.874 --> 03:25.496
they're stronger than us,

03:25.496 --> 03:27.918
faster, smarter.

03:27.918 --> 03:31.041
The next generation
of the human race is...

03:31.041 --> 03:32.923
living on a bionic island.

04:11.081 --> 04:12.503
Is everybody ready?

04:12.503 --> 04:14.875
Troy and Giselle
will be here any minute.

04:14.875 --> 04:17.838
You seem kinda nervous.
If I didn't know any better,

04:17.838 --> 04:19.339
I'd think you were trying
to get your old girlfriend back.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.432
That's ridiculous.

04:21.432 --> 04:23.223
How's my hair?

04:23.223 --> 04:24.975
Too spiky,
not enough spiky?

04:24.975 --> 04:26.347
Just the right amount
of spike?

04:26.347 --> 04:28.729
Never mind the spike.

04:28.729 --> 04:30.100
What are you gonna do
about the grays?

04:30.100 --> 04:31.061
Grays?!

04:35.275 --> 04:37.318
Whoa. Look at
this place.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.949
Hey, Troy.

04:38.949 --> 04:40.901
Welcome to
the Bionic Academy.

04:40.901 --> 04:43.704
- Thanks, I'm really happy--
- Giselle.

04:43.704 --> 04:46.537
Douglas.
Nice to see you.

04:49.119 --> 04:51.752
Still rockin'
the same old spikes, huh?

04:51.752 --> 04:53.334
I can change.
What do you like?

04:53.334 --> 04:55.546
Side part,
middle part, mullet?

04:56.547 --> 04:59.089
Hi. I'm Giselle.

04:59.089 --> 05:00.971
So honored to be telling
your story.

05:00.971 --> 05:03.804
And this is Troy West,
the actor who'll be
playing you in the movie.

05:03.804 --> 05:07.598
- Hi.
- What's up, guys?
It's really nice to meet you.

05:07.598 --> 05:08.979
I get it now.

05:08.979 --> 05:10.641
You got my body,
Bree's hair,

05:10.641 --> 05:12.353
but I'm not seeing
the Chase.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.024
He's perfect.

05:15.856 --> 05:17.988
Oh, come on.

05:17.988 --> 05:20.611
You seriously buy that
this guy's bionic?
I mean, compared to me--

05:20.611 --> 05:23.994
Dude, you really don't
wanna go there.

05:23.994 --> 05:26.497
Hey, thanks for
letting us come here
to do our research.

05:26.497 --> 05:28.499
I can't believe I'm
actually standing here

05:28.499 --> 05:30.160
with three bionic heroes.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.623
I'm not seeing anyone.

05:32.623 --> 05:35.295
Uh... that's not normally
what I lead with,

05:35.295 --> 05:37.508
but I'm not
seeing anyone.

05:38.629 --> 05:41.171
We won't get
in your way.

05:41.171 --> 05:43.053
I'm just here to
check out the academy

05:43.053 --> 05:45.095
so I can make the movie
as real as possible.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.306
And I'm just here to
learn about your bionics

05:46.306 --> 05:48.058
so my performance
will feel authentic.

05:48.058 --> 05:50.020
Totally get where
you're coming from, Troy.

05:50.020 --> 05:52.393
I'm a big-time actor
myself.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.395
Really? Movies?

05:54.395 --> 05:56.106
Uh, school plays.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.648
But I did see a mom
filming it on her phone,

05:57.648 --> 05:59.440
so it's only
a matter of time

05:59.440 --> 06:01.442
before it hits
theaters.

06:01.442 --> 06:04.154
I see.

06:04.154 --> 06:06.987
So what did you feel
was the key to your
character's inner life?

06:06.987 --> 06:08.789
I got to wear
a cowboy hat,

06:08.789 --> 06:10.621
and ride a wooden pony.

06:14.585 --> 06:18.128
And that's all you need
to know about Adam.

06:18.128 --> 06:22.052
Why, hello.
You must be Giselle.

06:22.052 --> 06:24.054
I'm Leo, the fourth
and most important member

06:24.054 --> 06:25.596
of the team.

06:25.596 --> 06:28.098
Of course. I know
all about you, Leo.

06:28.098 --> 06:30.431
Then you also know that
my fascinating life

06:30.431 --> 06:32.312
would make
a fantastic sequel.

06:32.312 --> 06:34.815
Or we can just forget about
the little cocktail weenies,

06:34.815 --> 06:37.187
and focus on
the main course. Me.

06:37.187 --> 06:39.229
Why...

06:39.229 --> 06:43.984
don't you guys go show
Troy some bionic moves?

06:43.984 --> 06:47.448
That'll give Giselle
a chance to walk around
this place,

06:47.448 --> 06:51.832
and remember how
adorable I am.

06:51.832 --> 06:54.955
We are gonna be walking
for a very long time.

06:57.207 --> 06:58.799
So you really think
you have what it takes

06:58.799 --> 07:00.541
to be a bionic
superhero?

07:00.541 --> 07:04.094
I hope so. Hey, I've been
training really hard.

07:04.094 --> 07:05.846
Check this out.
It's one of
Chase's abilities.

07:09.970 --> 07:12.723
- What was that?
- It was your bionic
eye scan.

07:12.723 --> 07:15.145
Hey, don't worry. Once they add
some special effects,

07:15.145 --> 07:16.266
it'll look really cool.

07:16.266 --> 07:18.148
No, it won't,

07:18.148 --> 07:19.940
'cause you're
doing it wrong.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.061
It goes like this.

07:24.865 --> 07:26.657
Oh, thanks, man.

07:26.657 --> 07:28.659
Yeah, I totally get
how that's different.

07:30.991 --> 07:34.875
Okay, so now who's
helping out with
the cheesy movie?

07:34.875 --> 07:37.998
I am not helping,
I am critiquing
his mediocre performance.

07:42.923 --> 07:45.085
Now the T-shirts,

07:45.085 --> 07:48.348
they would say
"Leo Dooley's bionic army."

07:48.348 --> 07:49.800
Get it?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.351
Army.

07:53.353 --> 07:56.186
'Cause I have
a bionic arm.

07:56.186 --> 08:01.231
Leo, would you please
give this lovely woman
her space?

08:01.231 --> 08:03.153
If you need someone
to write me into the script,

08:03.153 --> 08:05.315
I am your man,
I'm a born typist.

08:05.315 --> 08:07.237
Best hunt and pecker
in the business.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.448
Thirteen words
a minute.

08:08.448 --> 08:10.280
I also direct.

08:15.616 --> 08:17.117
That kid.

08:17.117 --> 08:21.211
He would do anything
to impress you.

08:21.211 --> 08:23.714
You know, Giselle,

08:23.714 --> 08:26.587
it's too bad that
you couldn't see

08:26.587 --> 08:28.258
all the other
brilliant things

08:28.258 --> 08:30.010
that I created
outside of here.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.682
You could make
a whole movie

08:31.682 --> 08:33.594
just about Marcus.

08:33.594 --> 08:35.135
Marcus.

08:35.135 --> 08:38.138
My greatest invention.
An advanced android

08:38.138 --> 08:41.311
with all of Adam, Bree,
and Chase's bionic abilities.

08:41.311 --> 08:44.444
Believe it or not,
he was even more
powerful than they are.

08:44.444 --> 08:48.068
Well, where is he?
I'd love to see him.

08:48.068 --> 08:49.820
You can see
parts of him.

08:51.201 --> 08:53.744
They're buried in
a huge pile of rubble

08:53.744 --> 08:55.245
in my old lair.

08:55.245 --> 08:57.828
I'm sorry.
Your lair?

08:57.828 --> 09:00.540
Yeah. Technically,
it's a suburban basement,

09:00.540 --> 09:03.123
but by law, you
have to call it a lair

09:03.123 --> 09:05.005
if you use it
to torture people.

09:12.382 --> 09:14.384
That is so cool.

09:14.384 --> 09:15.636
If you like
that ability,

09:15.636 --> 09:17.177
you're really
gonna like my...

09:18.348 --> 09:20.641
...invisibility app.

09:20.641 --> 09:22.232
No way.

09:22.232 --> 09:24.234
- How do you do that?
- It's not...

09:25.235 --> 09:27.688
...that...

09:28.779 --> 09:29.990
...hard.

09:29.990 --> 09:31.782
Awesome.

09:31.782 --> 09:33.363
Uh, thanks for
helping me out.

09:33.363 --> 09:34.615
Sure.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.326
I just wish Chase
was as open about

09:36.326 --> 09:37.958
his abilities
as you are.

09:37.958 --> 09:39.539
Don't take it personally.

09:39.539 --> 09:41.912
He's just really protective
of his image.

09:41.912 --> 09:43.664
He does know on
the fan boards,

09:43.664 --> 09:46.006
they call him
the bionic fun killer.

09:46.006 --> 09:48.468
Yeah, but to be fair,

09:48.468 --> 09:49.970
most of those posts
were mine.

09:53.213 --> 09:54.344
The thing is,

09:54.344 --> 09:57.177
I'm running out of time.

09:57.177 --> 09:58.849
I have to figure him out.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.601
If I don't,
Giselle might fire me.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.774
I really don't wanna
lose this role.

10:03.774 --> 10:06.647
Maybe I can help.
What do you need?

10:06.647 --> 10:07.728
I don't know.

10:07.728 --> 10:09.730
Stuff like, uh,

10:09.730 --> 10:11.441
how his chip was designed,

10:11.441 --> 10:13.613
and where his
super intelligence comes from.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.235
All the things
that make him

10:15.235 --> 10:16.827
the smartest
person in the world.

10:16.827 --> 10:18.789
Sorry. All I know is
what makes him

10:18.789 --> 10:22.002
the most annoying
person in the world.

10:22.002 --> 10:24.665
I mean, if all you need
is a bionic owner's manual,

10:24.665 --> 10:26.667
we can access
Mr. Davenport's
files from here.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.249
Really?

10:29.249 --> 10:31.511
Yeah, that would
be great.

10:31.511 --> 10:34.634
I mean, just a bunch
of boring schematics
and formulas, but...

10:34.634 --> 10:37.217
here you go.

10:37.217 --> 10:40.430
Everything there is
to know about Chase's chip.

10:40.430 --> 10:42.262
Thanks, Bree.

10:42.262 --> 10:44.224
You're pretty.

10:44.224 --> 10:46.476
I know.

10:48.438 --> 10:50.440
So now that
we're done working,

10:50.440 --> 10:51.862
do you wanna go
hit the pool?

10:51.862 --> 10:55.275
Sounds great.
I'll go change.

10:55.275 --> 10:56.616
Don't be too long.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.830
I mean,
take your time.

10:59.830 --> 11:01.331
I'm not desperate.

11:07.207 --> 11:10.170
Mission accomplished.
Here it is.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.291
Perfect.

11:11.291 --> 11:13.213
Now we can finally
take them out,

11:13.213 --> 11:15.716
and rid the world
of bionic humans forever.

11:26.646 --> 11:28.729
I'm so glad you guys
could come by the stage

11:28.729 --> 11:30.440
and watch us film.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.772
Just so you know,

11:31.772 --> 11:33.113
I tried keeping
the hair flat,

11:33.113 --> 11:35.776
but it won't stay down.

11:35.776 --> 11:38.909
And this is
our Hollywood version

11:38.909 --> 11:41.581
of the Bionic Academy.

11:41.581 --> 11:43.533
Looks awesome.

11:43.533 --> 11:45.625
No, it doesn't.

11:45.625 --> 11:46.787
The walls look fake.

11:46.787 --> 11:48.538
The floor
looks fake.

11:48.538 --> 11:50.881
Nothing in here looks
like the real academy.

11:50.881 --> 11:53.754
But your complaining
is very authentic.

11:56.426 --> 11:57.798
I gotta take this call
from my other movie,

11:57.798 --> 12:00.140
Killer Zombie
Orthodontists.

12:00.140 --> 12:02.052
Orthodontists?

12:02.052 --> 12:03.894
Yeah, I know.

12:03.894 --> 12:05.685
We're pretty much
out of ideas.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.561
Hey, Troy.

12:11.561 --> 12:12.943
Oh, hey.

12:12.943 --> 12:14.905
Hey, so, what happened?

12:14.905 --> 12:16.857
You said you were
gonna meet me at the pool

12:16.857 --> 12:19.529
and then you left
the island without
even saying good-bye.

12:19.529 --> 12:22.783
What do you
want me to say?

12:22.783 --> 12:24.865
Not much of
a water person.

12:27.918 --> 12:29.920
Great news.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.582
Since you were all
so helpful,

12:32.582 --> 12:35.295
I'm putting you in the scene
we're about to shoot.

12:35.295 --> 12:37.377
You want us
to be in the movie?

12:37.377 --> 12:40.380
Yep. But instead of
playing bionic heroes,

12:40.380 --> 12:41.932
you get to play
the bad guys.

12:41.932 --> 12:43.183
What do you think?

12:43.183 --> 12:46.306
I think Leo Dooley
better have a line.

12:46.306 --> 12:47.978
Cool. We're gonna be
in a movie!

12:47.978 --> 12:51.812
We're gonna be in a movie
we're gonna be in a movie!

12:51.812 --> 12:54.104
So now you're on board.

12:54.104 --> 12:58.198
Hey, Troy starring in
a bionic movie, lame.

12:58.198 --> 13:02.903
Me starring in
a bionic movie, awesome!

13:02.903 --> 13:04.865
Great. So then,
it's all settled.

13:04.865 --> 13:06.496
Any questions?

13:06.496 --> 13:09.499
Just one. What time
will this be on tonight?

13:14.004 --> 13:16.416
This is so cool.

13:16.416 --> 13:19.880
I finally get
to play a bad guy.

13:19.880 --> 13:26.056
Chase Davenport,
international bad boy.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.890
Settle down, bad boy.
Your mascara's running.

13:32.432 --> 13:34.194
I don't get it.

13:34.194 --> 13:36.987
Troy won't even talk to me.
It's so weird.

13:36.987 --> 13:38.318
Not really.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.280
Boys blow you off
all the time.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.072
( gasps )
What if he's got

13:42.072 --> 13:43.533
another girl
on set?

13:43.533 --> 13:45.825
So what?
You just met the guy.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.948
We had a connection.
I'm not crazy!

13:49.749 --> 13:51.251
Okay, look,
all I'm saying

13:51.251 --> 13:53.333
is that if he is
seeing someone else,

13:53.333 --> 13:54.955
I need to know about it,

13:54.955 --> 13:57.297
so I can go
sabotage it.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.050
Girls.

14:00.050 --> 14:02.883
Always going to
that desperate place.

14:04.634 --> 14:07.387
I hope Giselle's
not seeing someone else.

14:10.931 --> 14:13.563
- ( knocking on door )
- Troy?

14:23.323 --> 14:26.116
Self-absorbed much?

14:26.116 --> 14:29.539
Wow. Even his pictures
smell good.

14:31.201 --> 14:33.253
( computer chiming )

14:35.045 --> 14:37.127
Aha.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.000
Let's see who Mr. Popular
is getting messages from.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.002
GISELLE:
This won't take long.

14:42.002 --> 14:44.054
TROY: Hurry up.
I gotta be on set.

14:46.967 --> 14:49.429
This is what
I wanted to show you.

14:49.429 --> 14:54.014
I finally finished
analyzing Chase's
chip schematics.

14:54.014 --> 14:55.565
Then we're good.

14:55.565 --> 14:57.067
As soon as
they're ready to film,

14:57.067 --> 14:59.019
we'll do it.

14:59.019 --> 15:01.231
My pictures!

15:03.573 --> 15:06.076
Help me.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.707
Come on, let's
get outta here.

15:20.710 --> 15:22.712
I think I need
more pictures of me.

15:35.015 --> 15:39.479
( doing vocal exercises )

15:43.023 --> 15:45.405
Okay. Everybody,
we're about to start filming.

15:45.405 --> 15:46.987
Positions, please.

15:49.909 --> 15:51.121
Where's Bree?

15:51.121 --> 15:53.413
We'll take care
of her later.

15:54.744 --> 15:57.037
Just make sure you use
the real weapon

15:57.037 --> 15:58.288
on them.

15:58.288 --> 15:59.789
My pleasure.

15:59.789 --> 16:01.131
( bell rings )

16:01.131 --> 16:04.214
Okay.
Just like we rehearsed.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.506
Douglas, you and the kids
will say your lines,

16:06.506 --> 16:08.298
then Troy will
shoot you.

16:08.298 --> 16:10.010
Lights.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.051
Camera.

16:11.051 --> 16:13.053
Action!

16:16.896 --> 16:19.019
Any sign of
the bionic superhuman?

16:19.019 --> 16:20.480
I think we lost him.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.104
Told you we'd...

16:24.104 --> 16:26.526
get away with it.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.409
Great work,
everyone.

16:31.411 --> 16:34.164
I agree.

16:35.615 --> 16:38.248
Thanks for making it
so easy.

16:40.670 --> 16:43.123
No!

16:43.123 --> 16:44.544
What are you doing?

16:44.544 --> 16:45.925
She just ruined
the scene.

16:45.925 --> 16:48.428
And my take
was perfect.

16:48.428 --> 16:51.891
This is all a trap.

16:51.891 --> 16:54.344
Giselle lured us here
so that Troy could
take us out with this.

16:54.344 --> 16:56.556
Bree, that's
a prop.

16:56.556 --> 16:58.058
Really?

17:00.060 --> 17:02.692
- Whoa! What just
happened?
- Wait!

17:02.692 --> 17:05.194
I'm lost. Are we still
doing the scene?

17:05.194 --> 17:07.107
No.

17:07.107 --> 17:08.647
This isn't even
a real movie.

17:08.647 --> 17:11.411
What? Giselle,
what is going on?

17:11.411 --> 17:14.243
Go ahead.
Tell them.

17:14.243 --> 17:17.577
( chuckles )
With pleasure.

17:17.577 --> 17:19.868
The only reason I've been
making movies all these years

17:19.868 --> 17:22.832
is to fund my army
of advanced android
fighting machines.

17:22.832 --> 17:25.375
And just when I was
about to unveil

17:25.375 --> 17:27.046
my brilliant creations,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.589
along came Adam, Chase and Bree
to steal my thunder.

17:29.589 --> 17:33.343
And Leo. Why do people always
forget about Leo?

17:35.385 --> 17:37.887
I gave my androids
all of your abilities.

17:37.887 --> 17:40.059
The only one I couldn't crack
was super intelligence.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.103
Why didn't you just
ask me for it?

17:43.103 --> 17:44.894
We could've
worked together.

17:44.894 --> 17:47.066
I don't wanna
work with you.

17:48.688 --> 17:51.030
My technology
is far superior.

17:51.030 --> 17:53.193
You're my competition,

17:53.193 --> 17:55.455
and the first rule
in business is to
eliminate the competition.

17:55.455 --> 18:00.290
Really? I thought it was
location, location, location.

18:00.290 --> 18:01.581
This is crazy.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.254
There is no way that
your android technology

18:04.254 --> 18:05.755
is that advanced.

18:05.755 --> 18:07.707
( laughs )
Oh, really?

18:07.707 --> 18:10.260
Troy, why don't
we show them?

18:18.808 --> 18:20.600
Troy's a killer android?

18:20.600 --> 18:24.724
You really know
how to pick 'em, Bree.

18:24.724 --> 18:27.106
Now that I have
the schematics for
Chase's chip,

18:27.106 --> 18:30.280
I can give all my androids
his intelligence.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.112
Wait. How do you have
my schematics?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.364
Bree gave them to me.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.496
What?

18:36.496 --> 18:38.238
I'm sorry.
He tricked me.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.913
Nice work, Troy.

18:43.913 --> 18:45.165
Finish them off.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.167
Wait.

18:47.167 --> 18:51.130
If you destroy me,
you destroy Giselle's laptop,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.343
with Chase's schematics.

18:53.343 --> 18:55.595
That's right.
I switched them.

18:55.595 --> 18:57.347
Oh, who cares?

18:57.347 --> 18:59.259
I've got backups
all over my servers.

18:59.259 --> 19:01.060
Not if we create a virus
that takes out

19:01.060 --> 19:03.142
your entire network.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.355
Quick, hand me
the laptop.

19:05.355 --> 19:06.396
We need time
to field the virus.

19:06.396 --> 19:08.027
- Cover us.
- Take them out.

19:11.691 --> 19:14.404
Ow.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.866
Just wait for it.
It's gonna hurt
any second now.

19:18.738 --> 19:20.490
No? Okay then.

19:22.702 --> 19:24.204
Hey!

19:25.455 --> 19:27.377
That's not in the script.

19:46.306 --> 19:49.229
Easy. We're trying
to work here.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.271
Sorry.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.409
Adam.

20:03.122 --> 20:05.325
Got it.

20:05.325 --> 20:07.247
The virus is out.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.249
We just fried
all your servers,

20:09.249 --> 20:12.382
just like you fried
my heart.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.257
Surround them.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.016
Hey, where you
taking him?

20:28.308 --> 20:30.730
Since you destroyed
my network,

20:30.730 --> 20:32.982
there's only one way
to get Chase's chip.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.814
I'll have to rip it
out of him myself.

20:34.814 --> 20:36.115
Not if we stop you.

20:36.115 --> 20:37.817
That's not gonna happen.

20:37.817 --> 20:40.360
This entire set
is rigged with explosives.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.825
And once they detonate,

20:45.825 --> 20:49.208
the world will think
it's an unfortunate accident

20:49.208 --> 20:51.501
that claimed the lives
of the bionic

20:51.501 --> 20:53.333
not-so-superhumans.

20:56.215 --> 20:58.588
Good-bye, Douglas.

20:58.588 --> 21:00.800
And thanks for giving me
the last piece of the puzzle.

21:19.198 --> 21:20.900
Lock him up.

21:26.115 --> 21:27.537
Where am I?

21:27.537 --> 21:29.459
My robotics lab.

21:29.459 --> 21:31.461
Can I get you anything?

21:31.461 --> 21:33.833
Water, tea, sharp pain
in your neck

21:33.833 --> 21:35.675
as we rip out
your bionic chip?

21:37.417 --> 21:40.049
You know, I was built
on this very table.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.721
Kind of funny.

21:41.721 --> 21:44.013
It's where I had
my first day,

21:44.013 --> 21:46.015
and you're having
your last.

21:46.015 --> 21:48.348
( evil cackling )

21:48.348 --> 21:50.139
All this technology,

21:50.139 --> 21:52.812
and you couldn't give
him a sense of humor app?

21:54.734 --> 21:57.437
With your chip,
I can finally give my androids

21:57.437 --> 21:59.359
superior intelligence.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.361
And unlike bionic humans,

22:01.361 --> 22:03.783
they won't be vulnerable
to things like pain,

22:03.783 --> 22:07.036
or emotion,
or their lives ending.

22:07.036 --> 22:09.208
My family
will come for me.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.661
I'm sure they would

22:11.661 --> 22:14.123
if they weren't about
to be involved in

22:14.123 --> 22:15.835
a terrible accident.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.668
Accident?
What are you talking about?

22:23.763 --> 22:26.015
- BREE: Ten seconds.
- Wait. Something's weird.

22:26.015 --> 22:28.888
Why would Giselle leave
all her androids behind
to blow up with us?

22:31.931 --> 22:33.893
Good question. You should
probably ask them

22:33.893 --> 22:36.476
before they all
geo-leap away.

22:36.476 --> 22:37.647
Three seconds.

22:45.074 --> 22:46.786
Nooo!

22:46.786 --> 22:50.159
Well, that's a wrap
on your family.

22:50.159 --> 22:52.582
Wait. What is that?

22:55.164 --> 22:56.666
They escaped.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.998
But that's impossible.

22:58.998 --> 23:00.670
Not really.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.422
Looks like you need
my bionic intelligence

23:02.422 --> 23:04.674
more than your
stupid robots do.

23:04.674 --> 23:06.886
I was kidding.
Please don't take it out.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.387
Please don't
take it out!

23:14.273 --> 23:16.476
Great idea, Leo.

23:16.476 --> 23:18.608
How did you know that
grabbing onto an android

23:18.608 --> 23:20.780
while they were
geo-leaping would
geo-leap us out, too?

23:20.780 --> 23:22.191
I didn't.

23:22.191 --> 23:23.783
I just figured if I'm
getting blown up

23:23.783 --> 23:26.155
I'm taking
one of them with me.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.577
Come on.

23:27.577 --> 23:28.948
We gotta find Chase.

23:28.948 --> 23:30.700
I'll check
his GPS locator.

23:30.700 --> 23:32.331
Poor Chase.

23:32.331 --> 23:34.584
This is all my fault.

23:36.205 --> 23:39.298
Notice nobody's
saying no, it's not.

23:41.090 --> 23:42.882
I'm serious.

23:42.882 --> 23:45.925
I trusted Troy,
and now Chase may
die because of it.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.008
That's what you get
for falling in love
with an android.

23:49.008 --> 23:51.310
Hey, compared to some of
the other guys she's dated,

23:51.310 --> 23:53.012
a robot's
an improvement.

23:53.012 --> 23:56.355
His GPS signal's
not coming up.

23:56.355 --> 23:58.397
Giselle must've
deactivated it.

23:58.397 --> 24:00.980
Great. So now Chase's fate
lies in the hands

24:00.980 --> 24:02.862
of your evil
ex-girlfriend.

24:02.862 --> 24:05.735
Hey, at least she's human.

24:10.119 --> 24:12.031
I bet my family is tracking
me down as we speak.

24:12.031 --> 24:14.534
And when they do,
I'll take them out.

24:14.534 --> 24:15.915
Forget about them.

24:15.915 --> 24:18.708
It's time to remove
Mr. Know-it-all's chip.

24:18.708 --> 24:21.751
See, you think
you're insulting me with that,

24:21.751 --> 24:23.342
but it's actually
a compliment.

24:25.004 --> 24:26.886
How is it that
you're the one
strapped down,

24:26.886 --> 24:28.548
and I'm the one
being tortured?

24:28.548 --> 24:30.720
I'm gonna go find
something sharp

24:30.720 --> 24:32.722
to rip you open with.

24:33.933 --> 24:36.055
Ugh. Sounds messy.

24:36.055 --> 24:37.096
Better go get
my hairnet.

24:49.529 --> 24:51.531
Oh, come on.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.573
Why does the release have to be
all the way over there?

24:55.074 --> 24:56.245
Doesn't matter.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.708
Mr. Know-it-all
has molecular kinesis.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.379
It's go time, boys.

25:10.179 --> 25:12.762
Oh, yes.
Come on, come on.

25:12.762 --> 25:15.224
Come on, come on.

25:22.692 --> 25:24.023
How'd you get out?

25:24.023 --> 25:28.447
I'd tell you, but then
I'd have to destroy you.

25:28.447 --> 25:29.909
I'm gonna destroy you
anyway.

25:29.909 --> 25:31.701
It was molecular kinesis.

25:34.073 --> 25:35.825
Hold my hairnet.

25:38.658 --> 25:40.499
Good luck.

25:40.499 --> 25:42.291
Troy's programmed with
every form of martial arts,

25:42.291 --> 25:44.293
and if that doesn't work,
he's a biter.

26:06.946 --> 26:09.148
Abs of steel, brah.

26:09.148 --> 26:10.489
Literally.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.330
What is happening?

26:21.330 --> 26:23.703
It's called
a magnetism app.

26:23.703 --> 26:28.547
And this is called
reversing polarity... brah.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.175
Were you really gonna waste
my super intelligence

26:36.175 --> 26:38.557
on that hunk of junk?

26:38.557 --> 26:40.099
Even his ponytail
is dated.

26:41.811 --> 26:43.562
Of course not.

26:43.562 --> 26:45.104
Troy is the old model.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.226
It took me 20 years
to get him programmed

26:47.226 --> 26:49.859
to this level,
and he's still unreliable.

26:49.859 --> 26:52.862
Your intellect's going into
my new fleet of androids.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.153
What?

26:57.997 --> 27:00.830
Say hello to the future.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.294
Each android takes
the appearance

27:05.294 --> 27:08.297
of whatever human
I program it to be.

27:08.297 --> 27:10.049
That way,
they can blend in

27:10.049 --> 27:11.841
with the rest of
the population.

27:11.841 --> 27:13.673
This is my Uncle Jerry.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.966
A 50-year-old
with a gut?

27:16.966 --> 27:19.889
No offense, but the only thing
Uncle Jerry could destroy

27:19.889 --> 27:22.141
is a hoagie.

27:26.355 --> 27:28.317
If you think that hurt,

27:28.317 --> 27:30.319
wait till you meet
my Aunt Betty.

27:34.113 --> 27:36.275
Chase could be anywhere.

27:36.275 --> 27:39.699
And if he's in pieces,
he could be everywhere.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.451
Wait a second.

27:42.451 --> 27:45.204
I do have
Giselle's phone number.

27:45.204 --> 27:48.748
Would it be weird to just
call her?

27:48.748 --> 27:50.790
You don't wanna
seem too eager.

27:50.790 --> 27:52.551
Wait two days until
you ask her out again.

27:52.551 --> 27:54.293
Yeah. Good idea.

27:54.293 --> 27:57.887
Are you insane?!
Call her!

28:00.059 --> 28:02.101
( phone chiming )

28:04.643 --> 28:06.065
Hello.

28:06.065 --> 28:07.686
Hey, Giselle.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.569
It's Dougie.

28:10.569 --> 28:13.272
You called my cell phone?

28:13.272 --> 28:15.074
I abduct one of
your bionic kids,

28:15.074 --> 28:17.236
and you called
my cell phone?

28:18.447 --> 28:20.279
I told you it was
a bad idea.

28:20.279 --> 28:22.621
- I'm hanging up.
- You keep her on the line.

28:22.621 --> 28:24.033
I can trace
her location.

28:24.033 --> 28:26.035
I do it all the time
to spy on you guy...

28:26.035 --> 28:27.286
the enemy.

28:30.089 --> 28:34.673
So, just calling
to say hey.

28:34.673 --> 28:36.595
Quick question.

28:36.595 --> 28:38.798
I know it's been
about 20 years,

28:38.798 --> 28:41.801
but have you seen
my gray hoodie?

28:41.801 --> 28:43.933
Give it up, Douglas.

28:43.933 --> 28:45.724
I know you're trying
to trace me.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.226
You're too late.

28:50.479 --> 28:53.232
Hey, is that
Uncle Jerry?

28:53.232 --> 28:55.024
Where have you been, man?

28:55.024 --> 28:57.276
You dropped out of
our fantasy football league.

28:58.948 --> 29:01.320
Uncle Jerry is one of
my new androids.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.323
I can give him whatever
human form I want. See?

29:13.712 --> 29:14.753
Hurry.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.045
I got her location.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.376
Come on,
I'll super speed us.

29:17.376 --> 29:19.338
You can't leave now.

29:19.338 --> 29:21.300
You have company.

29:32.351 --> 29:33.983
Oh, not a good
time, dude.

29:33.983 --> 29:35.564
Can you come
back later?

29:51.410 --> 29:53.212
BREE: We have to protect
the academy.

30:10.429 --> 30:12.431
Am I close?
Talk me through it.

30:19.198 --> 30:22.241
Giselle's built the most
powerful android I've ever seen.

30:24.033 --> 30:25.654
How are we gonna
get past him?

30:25.654 --> 30:26.946
We have to get to Chase.

30:26.946 --> 30:28.948
I just sent you
Giselle's location.

30:28.948 --> 30:30.659
Take Adam and go get him.
We'll cover you.

30:30.659 --> 30:32.872
All right, Adam,
let's go get our mission suits.

30:32.872 --> 30:35.584
Good idea. We wanna
look our best when
we're being killed.

30:38.257 --> 30:40.169
You guys take the injured
to the infirmary.

30:40.169 --> 30:42.381
Douglas and I will lure the
android into the training room.

30:42.381 --> 30:43.762
You know what?

30:43.762 --> 30:45.424
I'm gonna leave that
to you.

30:45.424 --> 30:46.886
I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.889
Well, today,
you're a victim.

31:06.745 --> 31:08.908
Adam and Bree are here.

31:08.908 --> 31:10.869
I knew they'd
come for me.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.411
How'd I know?

31:12.411 --> 31:14.703
Because I'm...

31:14.703 --> 31:16.165
Well, if my hands
were free,

31:16.165 --> 31:18.877
I'd be pointing at
my head saying brilliant!

31:18.877 --> 31:21.800
Maybe we should
sedate him.

31:21.800 --> 31:24.843
Not for the pain,
I'm just sick of
hearing him talk.

31:24.843 --> 31:27.636
They may have gotten
past one android,

31:27.636 --> 31:29.678
but let's see how they do
with ten of 'em.

31:29.678 --> 31:31.640
No.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.771
I may be one of
your older models,

31:32.771 --> 31:34.683
but I can easily
take those two.

31:34.683 --> 31:35.975
Then do it.

31:38.978 --> 31:42.021
And you, get cutting.

31:43.362 --> 31:46.905
No, please. Wait. Stop.
Please!

31:46.905 --> 31:51.951
( loud, echoing
shriek )

32:02.751 --> 32:05.804
You know, I created a team
of bionic superhumans

32:05.804 --> 32:08.427
specifically so others
would fight my battles.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.549
These things aren't human,
they're machines.

32:10.549 --> 32:12.851
There's gotta be
some sort of internal

32:12.851 --> 32:15.554
power source we can take out
so they'll deactivate.

32:15.554 --> 32:18.057
When Giselle and I
built androids in school,

32:18.057 --> 32:20.769
we always fought about
where to store
the power source.

32:20.769 --> 32:22.861
I said in the neck
for easy access,

32:22.861 --> 32:26.365
she said in the nose
so it's not exposed.

32:26.365 --> 32:28.697
It's actually
why we broke up.

32:28.697 --> 32:31.660
Trust me, that is not
why you broke up.

32:32.911 --> 32:35.874
The point is, I bet
his power source is
in his nose.

32:35.874 --> 32:38.127
We just gotta
get in there
and shut it down.

32:38.127 --> 32:40.709
I am not sticking
my fingers in his nose.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.791
You can get in there
other ways.

32:42.791 --> 32:44.753
Just gonna take you
longer to get there.

32:47.546 --> 32:49.588
You go.
I'll cover you.

32:49.588 --> 32:51.850
Or you could be
the victim.

32:59.688 --> 33:01.810
I can't find him
anywhere.

33:01.810 --> 33:03.152
Me neither.

33:03.152 --> 33:05.024
- ( Chase shrieking )
- That's Chase.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.775
He must really
be in pain.

33:06.775 --> 33:08.777
Normally, I find
his screams soothing.

33:08.777 --> 33:11.490
Let's go.

33:12.701 --> 33:14.823
Oh, look.
Troy's here.

33:14.823 --> 33:17.376
I should give you two
some alone time.

33:17.376 --> 33:18.577
Adam.

33:18.577 --> 33:20.999
Which one of you should
I take out first?

33:22.421 --> 33:24.833
Giselle?

33:32.761 --> 33:34.763
Okay.

33:36.225 --> 33:39.438
So you have
heat vision, huh?

33:39.438 --> 33:41.310
How about
super strength?

33:44.943 --> 33:47.606
Boys.

33:50.949 --> 33:52.531
Wait.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.783
You make movies,
build robots,

33:54.783 --> 33:56.455
and you can fight?

33:56.455 --> 33:57.866
I know I'm supposed
to hate you,

33:57.866 --> 34:00.829
but can I just say,
you go, girl.

34:21.389 --> 34:22.731
This isn't working.

34:22.731 --> 34:23.891
One of us has to
distract him

34:23.891 --> 34:25.524
so the other one
can get in that nose,

34:25.524 --> 34:27.025
flip his switch
and shut him down.

34:27.025 --> 34:29.148
You pushed me out
the first time.

34:29.148 --> 34:30.819
You pushed me out
the second,

34:30.819 --> 34:32.951
so by my count,
you're up again.

34:46.255 --> 34:47.755
Come on, buddy.

34:47.755 --> 34:50.379
You gotta dig.
Get in there!

34:53.051 --> 34:55.214
Come on,
this is disgusting.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.639
Got it!

35:02.981 --> 35:05.103
( disgusted shriek )

35:07.776 --> 35:10.939
Did she really have to give
those things robo snot?

35:10.939 --> 35:15.033
Actually, that was
my idea.

35:34.803 --> 35:36.805
Whoa. Hey, you tell me
how to do that,

35:36.805 --> 35:38.887
I'll give you
Chase's chip.

35:51.690 --> 35:52.901
Giselle.

35:58.367 --> 36:00.329
You may have
cool abilities,

36:00.329 --> 36:02.120
but there's one thing
you haven't learned.

36:02.120 --> 36:06.245
Real heroes hit people
when their backs are turned.

36:10.209 --> 36:12.130
Chase!

36:13.171 --> 36:15.594
He's not breathing.

36:15.594 --> 36:17.676
There's no pulse.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.258
Oh, no.
This isn't happening.

36:19.258 --> 36:20.849
Come on, Chase.
Chase, come on.

36:20.849 --> 36:23.602
Adam, Adam.

36:23.602 --> 36:25.013
Adam!

36:26.805 --> 36:28.607
It's over.

36:28.607 --> 36:31.069
He's gone.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.734
And it's all my fault.

36:38.737 --> 36:40.949
I'm the worst
brother ever.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.451
All I ever did
was punch him

36:42.451 --> 36:44.162
and make fun of him.

36:45.914 --> 36:47.996
I never even told him
I loved him.

36:54.002 --> 36:56.134
Oh, ho.

36:56.134 --> 36:58.096
What a shame.

36:58.096 --> 36:59.928
You arrived too late.

36:59.928 --> 37:03.011
I will destroy you
for what you did to him.

37:03.011 --> 37:07.346
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

37:07.346 --> 37:11.059
But why mourn your brother
when you can join him?

37:17.195 --> 37:18.317
Yeah.

37:18.317 --> 37:22.411
Join me in kicking
your butt.

37:22.411 --> 37:25.784
- Chase!
- You're alive!

37:25.784 --> 37:27.366
Wait, there's
two of you.

37:29.668 --> 37:32.461
I'm having very mixed
emotions right now.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.004
How is this possible?

37:36.004 --> 37:39.087
After you were gone,
I used my molecular kinesis

37:39.087 --> 37:41.680
to redirect the android's
blade to cut me free.

37:43.051 --> 37:44.763
Wait, then who's
on the table?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.685
My android replica.

37:46.685 --> 37:49.438
Giselle was foolish enough
to show me how she makes them.

37:49.438 --> 37:51.350
So I distracted
her android,

37:51.350 --> 37:53.482
and I made one
that looks like me.

37:53.482 --> 37:55.984
When he tried to take
my chip out,

37:55.984 --> 37:57.195
I took him out.

37:57.195 --> 37:59.107
Well done.

37:59.107 --> 38:02.240
But there's plenty more
where he came from.

38:23.051 --> 38:26.094
I guess androids
aren't immortal after all.

38:26.094 --> 38:27.926
Technically,
they're not dead,
just deactivated.

38:27.926 --> 38:29.928
It's a good line,
just go with it.

38:31.690 --> 38:33.892
I am so glad that worked,

38:33.892 --> 38:36.485
because I did not want
to pick 20 noses.

38:38.146 --> 38:40.939
I thought I'd seen
the last of you, Douglas.

38:40.939 --> 38:43.532
Yeah? Well, this time,

38:43.532 --> 38:46.705
I'm breakin' up
with you.

38:46.705 --> 38:48.326
Hey!

38:48.326 --> 38:51.329
Troy, it's about time
you got here.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.832
What are you waiting for?

38:53.832 --> 38:55.253
Take them out.

38:55.253 --> 38:57.125
Oh, I will.

38:57.125 --> 38:59.127
But I'm taking
you out first.

39:00.218 --> 39:02.421
What?

39:02.421 --> 39:03.802
What are you doing?

39:03.802 --> 39:05.634
Surviving.

39:05.634 --> 39:07.676
You were gonna
get rid of me,

39:07.676 --> 39:09.428
so I'm gonna
get rid of you.

39:09.428 --> 39:11.269
And once I do,

39:11.269 --> 39:13.021
I'll be in charge
of all your androids.

39:14.433 --> 39:16.605
You?

39:16.605 --> 39:19.277
Please. No one's gonna
take you seriously.

39:19.277 --> 39:21.650
Then I'll make them
take me seriously.

39:23.031 --> 39:25.113
We won't just take out
bionic humans.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.246
We'll take out
all humans.

39:29.618 --> 39:32.250
Good-bye, Giselle.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.708
Save me, and I'll
get coffee with you.

39:42.340 --> 39:47.135
Douglas!

39:47.135 --> 39:50.719
Maybe now you'll take me
seriously, human.

39:50.719 --> 39:52.471
Get him!

39:52.471 --> 39:53.972
One more step
and I'll waste her.

39:53.972 --> 39:55.854
Adam, use your blast wave.

39:55.854 --> 39:58.356
No, it'll take you
out, too.

39:58.356 --> 40:00.899
Troy has no regard
for human life.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.652
If taking me out
means saving others,
then do it.

40:05.323 --> 40:07.075
I can't.

40:07.075 --> 40:08.737
He's gonna take
me out anyway.

40:08.737 --> 40:10.699
You might as well
take him out, too.

40:12.791 --> 40:15.744
She's right.

40:15.744 --> 40:17.375
( laughing )

40:17.375 --> 40:18.797
They don't
have the guts.

40:20.378 --> 40:22.300
It's okay.

40:48.947 --> 40:53.331
( heart pounding )

41:08.216 --> 41:10.138
Not much of
a water person.

41:29.027 --> 41:31.279
You owe me a swim.

41:31.279 --> 41:32.490
No!

41:39.958 --> 41:41.169
Adam!

41:41.169 --> 41:43.672
What? I thought
we were doing this.

41:48.887 --> 41:50.428
That was amazing.

41:50.428 --> 41:52.300
How did you know
to do that?

41:52.300 --> 41:55.053
I finally realized
why Troy didn't like water.

41:55.053 --> 41:57.305
Old androids must be
like cell phones.

41:57.305 --> 41:59.347
Sophisticated
technology,

41:59.347 --> 42:01.349
but if you drop it
in water, it's ruined.

42:01.349 --> 42:03.521
Wait, so does this mean
the role in Bionic Action Hero

42:03.521 --> 42:05.564
is up for grabs?

42:05.564 --> 42:08.987
Wait. Where did
Giselle go?

42:10.358 --> 42:11.780
Oh, man.

42:11.780 --> 42:14.362
The good ones
always get away.

42:15.363 --> 42:16.865
I mean...

42:16.865 --> 42:18.416
Oh, no.

42:20.208 --> 42:21.580
Come on, let's go.

42:24.542 --> 42:25.794
Hey, Adam.

42:28.006 --> 42:29.377
Just so you know,

42:29.377 --> 42:31.760
I love you, too.

42:31.760 --> 42:33.762
( scoffs )

42:33.762 --> 42:35.764
Uh, I never said that.

42:36.885 --> 42:38.386
You misheard me.

42:54.032 --> 42:57.365
I can't believe there's not
gonna be a movie made about us.

42:57.365 --> 42:59.908
You know, I do have
a friend from high school

42:59.908 --> 43:02.080
- who produces--
ALL: No!

43:03.461 --> 43:06.084
Chase, I'm sorry.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.876
I can't believe
I trusted Troy

43:07.876 --> 43:09.587
just because he was cute.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.419
And tall.

43:11.419 --> 43:14.512
And ripped.

43:14.512 --> 43:17.135
Yeah, well, now he's
mangled, melted and dead.

43:19.387 --> 43:23.521
Hey, what's important
is that everyone's okay.

43:23.521 --> 43:25.774
Yeah, Giselle is still
out there,

43:25.774 --> 43:29.147
but without her androids,
she's powerless.

43:29.147 --> 43:30.899
She's got nothin' left.

43:33.992 --> 43:35.994
Come on.

43:35.994 --> 43:38.286
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

43:38.286 --> 43:40.498
( instrument beeping )

43:42.500 --> 43:44.002
( beeping intensifies )

43:44.002 --> 43:45.744
There we go.

43:48.416 --> 43:51.710
Troy was such
a disappointment.

43:51.710 --> 43:55.804
But you won't be.

43:58.927 --> 44:01.760
Hello, Marcus.
