00:05.296 --> 00:07.257
Reba: This is the last day
of the battles.

00:07.298 --> 00:10.010
We're wrapping it up, and
we've been having so much fun.

00:10.051 --> 00:11.845
I'm the only coach
with a steal left.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.179
Who's got
the better team?

00:13.221 --> 00:14.848
* Team Gwen *
* Team Niall *

00:14.889 --> 00:17.183
Next, we go to the
knockout rounds. I can't wait.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.853
There's nothing here.
Only the winner right here.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.521
Daly: Tonight...
Look good together!

00:21.563 --> 00:23.023
...the artists take the stage

00:23.064 --> 00:24.941
for their final
battle performances.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.902
* Hold my hand *

00:27.944 --> 00:30.864
* Anything you want *

00:30.905 --> 00:35.285
* I'm gonna love you
the best that I can *

00:35.326 --> 00:37.912
Daly: And as the battles
come to an end,

00:37.954 --> 00:39.581
we're just getting started,

00:39.622 --> 00:42.167
because the three-way knockouts
start tonight.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.376
Give it up for your coaches!

00:43.418 --> 00:44.794
John:
The stakes are pretty high.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.088
Three artists,
only one can win the knockout.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.299
Gwen: No matter
which way you slice it,

00:49.341 --> 00:51.217
the three-way knockout
is brutal.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.053
The queen is here.
Reba: It's competitive.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.055
We get to steal.
We can save one.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.723
Daly:
With everything on the line,

00:56.765 --> 00:59.559
our coaches enlist help
from an iconic legend.
Yes!

00:59.601 --> 01:01.102
Oh, my God.
I'm freaking out.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.729
We've got our queen,
Ms. Reba,

01:02.771 --> 01:05.106
and we've got
another country queen.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.900
Queen in the house!

01:06.941 --> 01:08.234
I just felt really excited.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.320
I just know that she has
so much experience

01:10.362 --> 01:11.821
from such a young age.

01:11.863 --> 01:15.408
She's someone that can really be
just such a great mentor.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.203
Daly:
Country superstar Wynonna Judd.

01:18.244 --> 01:19.913
John: We've got Wynonna!

01:19.954 --> 01:23.083
At "The Voice,"
I want to instill in others

01:23.124 --> 01:24.668
what people like Loretta Lynn,

01:24.709 --> 01:27.504
Tammy Wynette,
Johnny Cash instilled in me,

01:27.545 --> 01:29.297
and I want to do that
for somebody.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.925
It's too much of a good thing,
and I like it.

01:31.966 --> 01:32.884
[ Laughter ]

01:32.926 --> 01:34.094
She got quotes.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.387
Pretend you're not
on "The Voice",

01:35.428 --> 01:36.763
and you're singing it for me.
Yeah.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.598
And we're hanging out
and we're in the car.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.435
Wynonna and I first started
working together early '80s.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.105
They told me The Judds
are gonna open the show.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.692
They did so well that everybody
fell in love with them.

01:48.733 --> 01:51.861
Wynonna is the most soulful
singing country artist

01:51.903 --> 01:53.113
in our business.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.364
The legend herself.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.282
John:
Wynonna is on tour right now,

01:56.324 --> 01:58.618
playing her first two
solo albums.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.787
She's been in this business
for decades.

02:00.829 --> 02:03.456
Squeeze your butt.
I do that when I hit high notes.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.417
[ Laughs ]
We're getting gems
over here.

02:05.458 --> 02:09.337
Daly: But first,
the battles continue right now.

02:09.379 --> 02:12.132
Next Team Niall
battle pairing --

02:12.173 --> 02:13.341
Brailey Lenderman

02:13.383 --> 02:15.135
battling Huntley.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.637
[ All shouting ]

02:17.679 --> 02:19.889
* Yeah, take us to the top *

02:19.931 --> 02:22.934
I was dreading if I was gonna
get paired with Huntley.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.645
Brailey: Huntley is one of
the most powerful singers

02:25.687 --> 02:26.813
I've ever heard.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.231
Niall!
[ Laughter ]

02:28.273 --> 02:29.691
He was like,
"They both have long hair."

02:29.733 --> 02:31.985
We're the hairiest
people here.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.528
She gave me
the littlest...

02:33.570 --> 02:35.071
Like, look at all that hair
in that brush, Huntley.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.322
Look at it.

02:36.364 --> 02:39.325
Aww.
Okay, we're going.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.036
[ Laughs ]

02:41.077 --> 02:44.330
I'm nervous. I got, like,
the first-day-of-school jitters.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.042
Yo, what's up, man?

02:47.083 --> 02:48.626
Niall: I paired Brailey
and Huntley together

02:48.668 --> 02:50.920
because they're my two soulful
pop rockers.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.131
They both have huge voices,
and I just felt like

02:53.173 --> 02:56.176
it was made for a big moment
on the battle stage.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.510
So, what have you
been up to?

02:57.552 --> 02:58.887
My daughter
turned seven, so...

02:58.928 --> 03:00.847
Dude, she's been
talking about you.

03:00.889 --> 03:01.848
She was so cute.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.100
* ...tell you
she's an orphan *

03:04.142 --> 03:06.519
What I love about Huntley is
his little daughter Stella,

03:06.561 --> 03:08.271
because she chose me.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.856
Niall.
* She talks to angels *

03:09.898 --> 03:11.024
Yes!

03:11.066 --> 03:12.692
I'm so happy to have Huntley
on my team.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.612
He has so much
unique character and tone

03:15.653 --> 03:18.198
that is basically unlike
anyone else in the competition.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.699
Heard my mom actually
bought tickets

03:19.741 --> 03:20.950
to your June show
in D.C.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.119
No way.
Yeah,
she's a super fan.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.371
I'll get you a refund.

03:24.412 --> 03:25.622
Hey. Oh, thanks.
I appreciate it.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.540
[ Laughter ]
You guys are both 33?

03:27.582 --> 03:29.209
Yeah.
We are.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.835
We've been chasing
this dream for a while.
We're excited.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.545
Both of you had
really special auditions.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.715
* If it makes you happy *

03:35.757 --> 03:38.176
I've been living in Nashville.
I work two jobs.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.719
I work in retail,

03:39.761 --> 03:41.930
and then I also work for this,
like, luggage service

03:41.971 --> 03:44.349
where I pick up people's luggage
from the airport.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.393
To pick a Sheryl Crow song,
it's huge.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.769
Like, that's a --
that's a big moment.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.729
Brailey: I've been
playing shows every week,

03:49.771 --> 03:51.731
doing what I can to be heard,

03:51.773 --> 03:53.483
'cause everybody says
it takes one moment.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.361
I mean, this could be it.
I'll take it if it is.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.696
* With a little love *

03:57.737 --> 03:59.531
Niall gave us "Hold My Hand"

03:59.572 --> 04:01.032
by Hootie & the Blowfish.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.867
When my daughter was born,

04:02.909 --> 04:04.577
she had an emergency
and her umbilical cord

04:04.619 --> 04:05.995
was actually wrapped
around her neck

04:06.037 --> 04:08.373
and they started trying
to get her to breathe.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.916
* With a little peace *

04:09.958 --> 04:12.419
So I mean...

04:12.460 --> 04:13.878
it was, like, terrifying.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.630
* We'll take
the world together *

04:15.672 --> 04:18.341
And I actually gave her
my finger and I held her hand,

04:18.383 --> 04:19.759
and then she came to.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.886
So every time
I hear this song,

04:21.928 --> 04:24.222
I think, she can come
and find her dad's hand

04:24.264 --> 04:25.890
and that everything
is gonna be okay.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.977
* Hold my hand *

04:29.019 --> 04:31.021
* I want you to
hold my hand *

04:31.062 --> 04:34.024
Last year, I went through
one of the worst depressions

04:34.065 --> 04:36.443
I've ever had in my life.
* I'll take you to a place *

04:36.484 --> 04:38.278
Then my husband,
he was very good

04:38.319 --> 04:41.614
about, um,
always finding my hand.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.616
Kind of like in the song,
how it says, like,

04:43.658 --> 04:45.452
"I'm gonna love you
the best I can."

04:45.493 --> 04:47.078
I was never by myself and...

04:47.120 --> 04:49.122
he was just that person.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.874
[ Laughter ]

04:50.915 --> 04:52.459
You see that?
That was awesome, guys.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.169
That's how you do it.
It's so good.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.378
And you can give it
even more.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.588
Get on your side!
Okay, sorry.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.631
The way you sung
the very last line,

04:58.673 --> 05:00.508
I would sing the verse
like that.
Okay.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.926
'Cause it had dynamic to it.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.845
But don't be afraid
to reach out

05:03.887 --> 05:06.056
and give a bit of grit
on some of the ends of notes,

05:06.097 --> 05:07.682
'cause it's very easy
to get all in your head

05:07.724 --> 05:08.933
about this note
and that note.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.810
That's what
I'm having trouble with.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.479
I just get nervous easily.
You've got
no reason to be nervous.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.855
You're hitting all the notes.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.024
Just hit them
with more determination.
Dope.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.484
I love Brailey's tone.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.194
I love the attitude
that she's got in her voice,

05:19.235 --> 05:23.448
but I don't think
she fully trusts her voice yet,

05:23.490 --> 05:25.700
and I don't think she's got
any reason to think that way.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.119
Have confidence
and go and show it off.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.704
She's like --

05:29.746 --> 05:31.206
Why'd you have to give her
confidence right before battles?

05:31.247 --> 05:33.416
Geez.
[ Laughter ]

05:33.458 --> 05:34.751
I think this battle
comes down

05:34.793 --> 05:37.629
to whoever holds their nerve
on the day.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.172
The votes
have been counted and verified,

05:39.214 --> 05:41.841

the winner is from Team Niall...

05:43.802 --> 05:45.762
This song and these two singers
have the ability

05:45.804 --> 05:47.430

the thing with you

08:38.059 --> 08:39.519
is I felt like
it wasn't until like,

08:39.561 --> 08:41.187

it was like,

09:01.249 --> 09:03.668
That was so fun
for us to watch.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.920
You even matched
your braids up there.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.505
I know, it's so cute.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.425
Brailey,
you were powerful.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.677
You made musical choices

09:12.719 --> 09:14.512
that were really appropriate
to the song,

09:14.554 --> 09:16.681
but still made it
feel fresh.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.224
The challenge is
you were against Huntley,

09:18.266 --> 09:22.395
and the magnetism and the energy
that you convey,

09:22.437 --> 09:26.149
it's just very attractive
and it connects people to you.
Thank you.

09:26.191 --> 09:29.903
There's something special about
that crackle in your voice,

09:29.944 --> 09:33.406

[ Laughter ]
Thank you so much, man.
I appreciate that.

09:35.617 --> 09:39.662
Well, Brailey and Huntley, I
think y'all did a wonderful job.

09:39.704 --> 09:43.583
Being a solo artist,
I miss the duets so much.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.293
It kind of made me
a little envious

09:45.335 --> 09:47.170
that I didn't get to be up there
and singing with y'all.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.172
You should have came
up here with us.
We could be a trio.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.340
Next time, alright?

09:50.382 --> 09:53.343
But, Brailey,
I think your tone is great.

09:53.385 --> 09:54.886
Your voice is gorgeous.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.931
I did hear a few pitchy things
every once in a while,

09:57.972 --> 10:01.351
but I'd probably be on the floor
if I was in your position.

10:01.393 --> 10:05.271
And, Huntley, I do like your
stage presence, your look.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.274
You're a force
of nature on stage.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.151
Thank you, Coaches.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.112
Alright, Niall, this is gonna be
a tough one for you, I know,

10:12.153 --> 10:14.364
but give us some thoughts first
on the battle.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.658
Wow. That is by far the best
you've done it, guys.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.368
Unbelievable singing
from both of you.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.121
Huntley, your stage presence
is just insane to watch.

10:21.162 --> 10:25.083
You prowl around that stage
whilst also singing that well.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
Thank you so much, brother.
I appreciate that.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.755
And I know Brailey kind of gets
nervous for most performances.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.173
Didn't look like it today,
Brailey.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.967
You were absolutely
on fire up there.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.301
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.469
As always, these are

10:36.511 --> 10:39.222
ridiculously
tough decisions that, sadly,

10:39.264 --> 10:41.683
I'm the stupid one
that has to make them.

Niall:
I genuinely think that Huntley

11:01.202 --> 11:02.787
could win
this competition outright.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.165
The way he sings and the power
that he gives on stage,

11:05.206 --> 11:06.833
he had the room
on the edge of their seat.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.752
I just can't wait to see what
he does in the knockouts now.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.005
A little shocked right now.
Sorry. Um...

11:12.047 --> 11:14.841
I'm so excited
to call my daughter.

I'm gonna tell her,
unfortunately,

you want to say to Niall?

11:25.935 --> 11:28.021
I've been doing this
for nine years

11:28.063 --> 11:30.023
and I've never gotten
a "yes,"

11:30.065 --> 11:34.027
and you gave me my first one,
so I really appreciate it.

so proud of yourself.

the decision so tough,

to go for Huntley.

That Huntley,
he's something else.
He's a beast.

How you doing?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.290
I paired Crystal and Caitlin
together

12:29.332 --> 12:32.627
because Crystal is more R&B
and Caitlin's more country.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.213
Opposites attract,

it'd have been redundant.

about breathing.

of the song I've written.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.422
Now let's add to it.
Yes.

14:40.463 --> 14:44.676
When you're listening to
this song, listen to the words,

14:44.718 --> 14:48.263
take the lyrics
and really dissect them.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.474
Where are you nostalgic?
Where are you sad?

Where are you happy?
When it's happy, sparkle.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.022
When it's sad,
it's not any sparkle at all.

Yeah.

This song is tagged
to a lot of memory now.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.029
"The Song Remembers When"
is all about,

15:04.070 --> 15:05.321
the song carries memory,

15:05.363 --> 15:06.948
and that's the beautiful thing
about music.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.201
It carries with it memory.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.287
And for me,
it means so much more,

15:12.328 --> 15:14.664
because my mom
passed away to cancer,

15:14.706 --> 15:17.542
so when I hear
certain types of music,

15:17.584 --> 15:19.961
it's like
she's kind of with me.

15:20.003 --> 15:24.674
It was probably the most
devastating thing in my life.

15:24.716 --> 15:29.179
She was a fan of "The Voice."
She absolutely loved Reba.

15:31.681 --> 15:36.561
It's good to know that she would
approve of me being here

15:36.603 --> 15:39.939
and of Reba choosing me.

15:39.981 --> 15:41.941

that I wrote.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.038
I'm a singer-songwriter
in the music industry.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.332
I've been that for
20-plus years now,

15:57.374 --> 15:59.334
and I've never actually
sang it myself

15:59.376 --> 16:02.295
outside of just recording
the demo for Rihanna.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.464
And Rihanna does such
an amazing job with it,

16:04.506 --> 16:06.257
so I was
absolutely terrified.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.009
And thankfully,
Reba heard something

16:08.051 --> 16:10.178
that nobody else
heard that day.

and I am thrilled to death

16:16.059 --> 16:17.769

your coach.

I haven't had that
in a few years, so...

16:23.858 --> 16:25.110

songwriter and singer.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.252

Reba: They're just
both great singers.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.009
That one's gonna be
really tough,

16:49.050 --> 16:52.178

to progress.

Oh, my gosh. That was
absolutely breathtaking.

out of the ballpark,

* Underneath
the bridge I've burned *

19:15.822 --> 19:19.200
* And there's no use
in backtracking around *

* Still, I guess
some things we bury *

* Are just bound
to rise again *

20:02.827 --> 20:05.580
That's all the comment
it needed.

20:05.622 --> 20:08.291
Your voice, Crystal,
is just so round,

20:08.333 --> 20:11.127
and you have one of those voices
that just like, fill up the room

20:11.169 --> 20:14.297
and make people feel warm and --
and fuzzy inside.

20:14.339 --> 20:17.884
And, Caitlin, "familiarity"
is the word that comes to mind.

20:17.926 --> 20:20.637
I'm really sad
that I didn't get to turn.

20:20.679 --> 20:23.264
You had a chance to turn.
Like, you could have turned.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.392
True. Um...
[ Laughter ]

20:25.433 --> 20:26.726
It's okay.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.561
I think leaning
towards Caitlin for me,

20:28.603 --> 20:31.356
because just
the storytelling of it

20:31.398 --> 20:33.608
and you gave across
a flawless vocal.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.318
Not that Crystal didn't,
to be honest, by the way.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.153
This is like a 50/50 battle.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.280
[ Applause ]
Thank you.

20:39.322 --> 20:43.993
Caitlin, you're very memorable
in your style that you sing,

20:44.035 --> 20:46.871
and it's just kind of
a rare-sounding voice.

20:46.913 --> 20:51.376
And, Crystal, you just have
this strength in your voice.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.586
It's hard for you to
not turn up,

20:53.628 --> 20:56.047
because you're just
naturally so strong.

20:56.089 --> 21:00.093
I thought you both handled
the emotion of the song well.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.678
Both amazing.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.470
Okay.

21:02.512 --> 21:04.431
John: Crystal, your voice

21:04.472 --> 21:06.808
really takes up space
in a really nice way.

21:06.850 --> 21:11.396
It has, like,
presence and clarity.

21:11.438 --> 21:14.524
You just seem so, like,
in command

21:14.566 --> 21:16.234
of who you were
as a vocalist.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.944
And, Caitlin,

21:17.986 --> 21:21.239
your tone felt like it was
a bit more at home in the song.

21:21.281 --> 21:22.866
I think in
this particular moment,

21:22.907 --> 21:25.994
it felt like Caitlin
won this battle

21:26.036 --> 21:27.662
just for that reason.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.205
Mm-hmm.
Daly: Thank you, Coaches.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.498
Alright, Queen Reba,

21:30.540 --> 21:31.958
what'd you think about
that battle?

21:32.000 --> 21:33.168
I loved it.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.420
Thank y'all very much
for working so hard

21:35.462 --> 21:37.589
and making that song
so good.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.050
I know Trisha would be
thrilled to death.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.885
Crystal, you knocked it
out of the ballpark.

21:41.926 --> 21:44.554
It was
absolutely wonderful.

21:44.596 --> 21:46.097
And, Caitlin,
you gave it all.

21:46.139 --> 21:50.226
You gave the vocal, the emotion.
I'm so proud of both of you.

21:50.268 --> 21:54.689
You stood out and you
complemented each other.

21:54.731 --> 21:58.193
It was good.
I don't know what to do now.

21:58.234 --> 22:00.278
Oh, gosh.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.696
You ready?
No.

Okay.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.007
Caitlin, congratulations!

22:21.049 --> 22:23.259
You're moving on to the
knockouts for Team Reba!

22:23.301 --> 22:27.347
Oh, Caitlin and Crystal
were really hard for me.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.224
Crystal is so good,

22:29.265 --> 22:32.310
but Caitlin,
the way she expresses herself,

22:32.352 --> 22:35.855
she's not only country, she's
kind of a country-pop artist,

22:35.897 --> 22:39.734
so I think it'll be a lot of fun
to get to pick songs for her.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.112
I don't like this.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.072
Crystal, anything you want
to say to your coach?

22:44.114 --> 22:47.534
Coach Reba, don't feel bad.
That was a great choice.
I do!

22:47.575 --> 22:49.411
I've gained so much
from this experience,

22:49.452 --> 22:50.787
so thank you so much.

22:50.829 --> 22:53.164
Give it up for Crystal Nicole,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.791
Oh, man.

22:54.833 --> 22:58.128
The competition in the battles
is so good this season.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.546
I don't like that.

22:59.587 --> 23:00.964
See, why couldn't she be
a horrible person

23:01.006 --> 23:02.424
and take that really badly?

23:02.465 --> 23:04.134
I know it.
Do you know what I mean?

23:04.175 --> 23:05.802
Everybody has stepped up
to the plate,

23:05.844 --> 23:08.096
but the decisions
have been so hard.

23:08.138 --> 23:11.558

that hard, but it did.

with a steal left.

they're all about redemption.

the first time,

to finally come home.

that we were paired,

but I was very excited...
I know.

24:04.527 --> 24:07.906
...that it was you, because both
of us have similar tones.
Right.

because I feel like

24:10.283 --> 24:12.660
they, genre-wise,
are in the same lane.

a little soul.

The blinds were surreal.
It was a beautiful moment.

of background singing.

your performance was gorgeous.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.288
Walking in rehearsal today,
I was just in awe,

because I'm literally in here
with Gwen Stefani,

who I've watched
since I was a kid.

25:02.502 --> 25:05.130
Where did you grow up?
In Riverside, California.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.798
We used to play out there
all the time.

a Cali girl like me.

25:08.299 --> 25:09.259
Yes, yeah.
So, yes.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.969
We used to
play at Spanky's Cafe.

25:11.011 --> 25:13.304
I've performed there
before.
You have?

25:13.346 --> 25:14.514

25:14.556 --> 25:15.974
Oh, my God.
That's so dope.

of your guys' voices.

And we love it.

25:21.312 --> 25:24.441
Gwen gave us
"Have You Ever" by Brandy,

25:24.482 --> 25:29.195
and her choosing that shows
how much of a genius she is.

25:29.237 --> 25:30.697
This is my roots
right here.

25:30.739 --> 25:31.990
My sister Mikala and I,

25:32.032 --> 25:34.617
we literally would stand
in front of the TV

25:34.659 --> 25:37.162
and just be mesmerized
by the song.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.998
She's always been
very supportive of my career,

25:40.040 --> 25:43.168
so when I was going through
the process of blinds,

25:43.209 --> 25:45.920
it was just really exciting that
I could share that with her.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.714

wrap my head around it.

Gwen: Brandy was huge when
I was coming up in No Doubt,

so it was fun to relive
that time period.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.028
* Have you ever? *

26:10.070 --> 26:13.073
Gwen: Kara, she has
that classic '90s R&B vibe,

26:13.114 --> 26:15.825
and she is really dynamic
with her voice.

26:15.867 --> 26:18.870
And I loveBrandon's voice.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.164
* What do I gotta do
to get you in my arms? *

26:21.206 --> 26:24.459
The rasp, the whisper,
and then he can do all the runs.

26:24.501 --> 26:27.045
Let it be known --
he was a four-chair turn.

26:27.087 --> 26:30.465
Reba blocked John,
so hello, Team Gwen.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.217

26:32.258 --> 26:34.469
They are actually quite equal

their abilities.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.014
Pretty!
Thank you.

26:38.056 --> 26:40.767
This is where I always
get kind of nitpicky,

26:40.809 --> 26:46.898
just because the genre is, like,
all about runs and acrobatics,

26:46.940 --> 26:49.567
but that has to come
from the lyric.

26:49.609 --> 26:52.153
Yes.
Individuality comes through

26:52.195 --> 26:54.072
when it's coming truly
from the heart.

I've never performed

27:05.041 --> 27:07.460
Really hits on
a different level for me.

27:07.502 --> 27:09.963
I lost my grandfather
a year ago.

27:10.005 --> 27:11.965
He was one of
my closest friends,

27:12.007 --> 27:15.844

it just didn't feel real.

27:15.885 --> 27:17.262
[ Sighs ]

27:17.303 --> 27:20.515
My grandfather
was a gospel producer,

27:20.557 --> 27:21.766
and it's because of him,

27:21.808 --> 27:24.352
the reason
why I am singing today.

27:24.394 --> 27:25.645
Getting to the knockouts

27:25.687 --> 27:28.356
would just be another step
closer to the dreams

27:28.398 --> 27:31.276
that my grandfather
had always envisioned for me.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.111
The singing was ridiculous.
Thank you.

27:33.153 --> 27:36.406
But I think you can bring
more of that character out.

27:36.448 --> 27:39.909
Okay. Yes.
You're gonna be on TV,
and they're gonna cut

27:39.951 --> 27:41.953
from some person
in the audience to her,

27:41.995 --> 27:43.204
to you, this and that.
Yes.

27:43.246 --> 27:44.622
You want to make them cry.

27:44.664 --> 27:45.999
Yes.
Right?

27:46.041 --> 27:47.459
They're gonna cut in
and you just got to be,

27:47.500 --> 27:48.585
* Have you *

27:48.626 --> 27:50.045
You know what I'm saying?
Gotcha. Yeah.

27:50.086 --> 27:51.296
A little more animated,
a little extreme.

27:51.338 --> 27:52.630
And then for you,
on a first chorus,

27:52.672 --> 27:55.133
try to blend
a little bit better with him

27:55.175 --> 27:56.926
when you're doing
the more background part.

27:56.968 --> 28:00.638
I'm losing you a little bit,
and it's not just volume.
Gotcha.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.807
You're too sharp
and too intense,

28:02.849 --> 28:04.267
and you're too soft
and round,

28:04.309 --> 28:06.644
and it's not gelling together
in the choruses.

28:06.686 --> 28:09.230
Working with Gwen,
I'm learning so much.

28:09.272 --> 28:11.066
I think next time,
I'd love to see you

28:11.107 --> 28:15.028
even give me a little bit more,
just a little bit more body.
Okay.

28:15.070 --> 28:16.988
It's really about,
how do you stand out so that

28:17.030 --> 28:18.239
when you walk off the stage,
they're like,

28:18.281 --> 28:20.367
"Oh, my gosh,"
they can't forget you.

28:20.408 --> 28:23.787
These gems that she's giving me,
you don't get these every day,

28:23.828 --> 28:27.207
so it's very important
that I make it to knockouts,

28:27.248 --> 28:29.292
'cause I don't want it to end.

28:29.334 --> 28:32.462

I never had a baby doll.
I never had a teddy bear.

38:25.221 --> 38:26.931
We had canned goods.
Pots and pans
and canned goods.

38:26.973 --> 38:28.516
Pots and pans.
You bet.

38:28.558 --> 38:29.934
[ Laughing ]
That's what we had.

38:29.976 --> 38:31.353
Wynonna: It was really
important to be here,

38:31.394 --> 38:32.729
because Reba is like family.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.606
Oh, I'm glad
you're here.

38:34.647 --> 38:36.316
I'm so glad to
be here with you.

38:36.358 --> 38:37.734
I needed this to connect

38:37.776 --> 38:40.236
with the next generation
of greatness,

38:40.278 --> 38:43.281
so they get the same wisdom
that I got from Tammy Wynette,

38:43.323 --> 38:46.534
Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash,
Merle Haggard,

38:46.576 --> 38:47.869
and so I'm passing it on.

38:47.911 --> 38:50.205
Walking in that door
is three great singers.

38:50.246 --> 38:52.874
Jacquie, I wanted her
from the very beginning,

38:52.916 --> 38:54.376
but Gwen got her.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.336
Well, that hussy.
I told her.

38:56.378 --> 38:58.713
Reba: Boy, when I had a chance
to steal her, I did.

38:58.755 --> 39:00.048
She has stage presence.

39:00.090 --> 39:02.175
She sings with a band,
and a great range.

39:02.217 --> 39:07.597
And Tom has that Chris Stapleton
gravelly voice that I love.

39:07.639 --> 39:09.432
And Alison, I turned for her

39:09.474 --> 39:12.560
because I did hear something
sweet in her voice.

39:12.602 --> 39:15.855
So all three of these artists
are totally different.

39:15.897 --> 39:19.067
Bring 'em on in.
Here they come.

Oh, my God.
Wynonna?

39:24.364 --> 39:25.740
Tom: Heck, yeah.

39:25.782 --> 39:27.117
I'm freaking out.

39:27.158 --> 39:29.369
Her hair is even more red
than I thought it was.

39:29.411 --> 39:30.829
When I walked in today

39:30.870 --> 39:32.664
and I saw that Wynonna
was on the stage,

39:32.706 --> 39:34.416
I was like, okay, there's red

39:34.457 --> 39:35.625
and then there's big red.

39:35.667 --> 39:37.877
Two redheaded beauties.
I'm dying.

39:37.919 --> 39:40.088
Wynonna is
the perfect mega mentor

39:40.130 --> 39:43.550
because she has
that longevity in her career.

39:43.591 --> 39:44.968
I'm very glad that she's here.

39:45.010 --> 39:46.177
Who wants to go first?

39:46.219 --> 39:48.263
I'll go first.
Okay. Alright.

39:48.304 --> 39:50.473
You guys can
sit right over here.
Will do.

39:50.515 --> 39:52.100
This is gonna be
very interesting.

39:52.142 --> 39:55.311
They built the stage
and the rehearsal hall,

39:55.353 --> 39:57.022
like it is on the main stage

39:57.063 --> 39:59.816
so the contestants
can get used to it,

39:59.858 --> 40:02.902
and I am so excited
for Team Reba.

40:02.944 --> 40:05.155
Alison, what are you
singing for us today?

40:05.196 --> 40:06.781
"It's Too Late"
by Carole King.

40:06.823 --> 40:08.450
Ohh.
Oh, wow.

40:08.491 --> 40:09.951
I love Carole King.

40:09.993 --> 40:11.703
She's one of my greatest
songwriting inspirations.

40:11.745 --> 40:13.121
Thank you
for choosing that,

40:13.163 --> 40:15.248
because it reminds us
of where music comes from.

40:15.290 --> 40:19.836
* Stayed in bed all morning
just to pass the time *

40:19.878 --> 40:22.130
I started writing songs
when I was 13.

40:22.172 --> 40:24.758
Carole King
is an incredible storyteller.

40:24.799 --> 40:27.802
I'm 23, so I'm in
the baby stages of my career,

40:27.844 --> 40:31.973
and I'm really looking not just
for a moment, but for longevity.

40:32.015 --> 40:35.810
* And it's too late, baby,
now it's too late *

40:35.852 --> 40:37.645
I love Alison's voice so much.

40:37.687 --> 40:40.940
I think we need the storytellers
more and more and more and more,

40:40.982 --> 40:43.485
and these classics
are so important

40:43.526 --> 40:44.778
for the next generation to hear.

40:44.819 --> 40:46.363
* And I can't hide *

40:46.404 --> 40:48.865
Reba: Alison has grown
tremendously on the show.

40:48.907 --> 40:50.825
She's having a blast, too,

40:50.867 --> 40:52.869
so her confidence level
has come up.

40:52.911 --> 40:55.663
But I think Alison's
biggest challenge

40:55.705 --> 40:58.875
is that it's a very sad song,

40:58.917 --> 41:01.044
so that needs to come out more.

41:01.086 --> 41:04.005
I see a high-speed chase
in your brain right now.

41:04.047 --> 41:05.548
You're thinking,
"Should I close my eyes?

41:05.590 --> 41:07.342
Should I open my eyes?
Should I move my right arm?

41:07.384 --> 41:09.094
Should I --
Should I dance a little bit?"

41:09.135 --> 41:11.721
Relax. Be still.
You don't have to conduct.

41:11.763 --> 41:13.765
All you have to do
is tell the story.

41:13.807 --> 41:15.308
And pretend you're not
on "The Voice"

41:15.350 --> 41:17.018

singing it for me

and we're in the car.

of relaxing into the low notes.

from Wynonna was so affirming.

long-standing career,

to her and Reba

interactions together,

just a half a step,

a little bit lost

43:27.524 --> 43:29.317

the strongest team possible

47:11.915 --> 47:13.375

are really important.

that two of the people

47:19.839 --> 47:21.466
are not gonna continue on

unless they get stolen by
another coach or it's a save.

the exact right song,

nailed that lane.

slightly leaned toward Jacquie

the execution

01:05:24.966 --> 01:05:27.177
I'm usually telling artists
to go higher,

01:05:27.218 --> 01:05:30.263
but in her case....
[ Laughter ]

01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:34.476
* It ain't no way *

01:05:34.517 --> 01:05:35.852
Her vibrato
is so nice.

01:05:35.894 --> 01:05:39.105
* For me to give you
all of me *

01:05:39.147 --> 01:05:40.899
That's what
I wanted more of.
Yeah.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.943
I want to show them
that I can take in advice

01:05:43.985 --> 01:05:45.945
and, you know, use it,
get better at it,

01:05:45.987 --> 01:05:48.198
and show them
in my next performance.

01:05:48.239 --> 01:05:50.241
Good job.
How did that feel?
Oh!

01:05:50.283 --> 01:05:51.701
That felt very comfortable.

01:05:51.743 --> 01:05:53.411
Good.
You're wonderful.

01:05:53.453 --> 01:05:54.996
Thank you! I love you guys.
I love you guys.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.164
Thank you.
So good.

01:05:56.206 --> 01:05:57.791
All right, Caleb,
talk to me.

01:05:57.832 --> 01:05:59.459
What song
did you choose?

01:05:59.501 --> 01:06:01.461
I'm singing "Jealous"
by Nick Jonas.

01:06:01.503 --> 01:06:03.046
Oh, cool.
And I chose this song --

01:06:03.088 --> 01:06:05.465
I feel like it fits my range
and it fits my voice well.

01:06:05.507 --> 01:06:07.342
And I think I can bring
some life to it.

01:06:07.384 --> 01:06:08.968
Oh, fun.

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:11.262
We actually covered
that song as coaches...
Yeah?

01:06:11.304 --> 01:06:14.808
...during Nick's first season
as a coach on "The Voice."

01:06:14.849 --> 01:06:16.309
I'm ready.
I'm excited for this.

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:20.563
* I don't like the way
he's looking at you *

01:06:20.605 --> 01:06:22.357
John:
Caleb has a beautiful voice.

01:06:22.399 --> 01:06:23.650
He has a great falsetto.

01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:25.318
I love that the artists
get to choose

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.320
their own song
in the knockouts.

01:06:27.362 --> 01:06:29.030
I get to know them better
as an artist,

01:06:29.072 --> 01:06:30.490
and our audience does, too.

01:06:30.532 --> 01:06:33.159
* You love me,
can't help it, hey *

01:06:33.201 --> 01:06:35.578
John: This is something
I didn't expect from him.

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.706
He's been doing songs
that are more mellow

01:06:37.747 --> 01:06:40.667
and a little slow to mid-tempo,
and I want to make sure

01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:42.711
he embraces
the energy of the song

01:06:42.752 --> 01:06:44.421
and really connects
with the audience.

01:06:44.462 --> 01:06:47.507
* I still get jealous *

01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:49.509
Kaylee: This man can sing!

01:06:49.551 --> 01:06:52.429
He has such
a silky, smooth voice.

01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:53.805
His runs are
just like a waterfall.

01:06:53.847 --> 01:06:56.141
You know what I mean?
Just like...

01:06:56.182 --> 01:06:57.350
He's so good.

01:06:57.392 --> 01:06:59.019
I was like, "Oh, my God."

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:02.063
* Jealous, ooh *

01:07:02.105 --> 01:07:03.690
Yeah!

01:07:03.732 --> 01:07:05.316
Thank you.
Yay!

01:07:05.358 --> 01:07:06.401
* Jealous *

01:07:06.443 --> 01:07:08.987
Yes!
Your voice sounds so good.

01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:10.447
You're quite the package.

01:07:10.488 --> 01:07:12.532
You've got such
a big spirit.
Thank you.

01:07:12.574 --> 01:07:14.034
You know, there were
a few technical things,

01:07:14.075 --> 01:07:16.161
but I'm not a technical person.
I'm more from the heart.

01:07:16.202 --> 01:07:19.622
Yes.
I really want you
to talk to me.

01:07:19.664 --> 01:07:22.417
I want to feel more
of a connection with you.

01:07:22.459 --> 01:07:25.462
Yes. It felt like
you were singing it,

01:07:25.503 --> 01:07:27.297
but you weren't
feeling it yet.

01:07:27.339 --> 01:07:30.550
Find somebody in the audience.
Give them eye contact.

01:07:30.592 --> 01:07:32.927
You're telling them
a story.
Okay.

01:07:32.969 --> 01:07:37.807
* I turn my chin music up
and I'm puffing my chest *

01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:40.643
The story of "Jealous" is
there's this beautiful woman

01:07:40.685 --> 01:07:42.395
who I'm seeing,
but every time we're, like,

01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:44.731
walking in a room, people are,
like, looking at her.

01:07:44.773 --> 01:07:46.524
And I'm kind of
getting jealous at that.

01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:48.151
My girlfriend is beautiful.

01:07:48.193 --> 01:07:50.070
I met DeAndrea in college.

01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:51.905
I always see, like,
people are looking

01:07:51.946 --> 01:07:53.907
and people are, like, staring,
so that would always make me

01:07:53.948 --> 01:07:55.742
feel some type of way,
but then I realized

01:07:55.784 --> 01:07:56.993
I'm the one who got the prize.

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:59.120
I'm gonna definitely
think about her.

01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:00.997
* Still get jealous *

01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:02.916
Yes!
Yeah!

01:08:02.957 --> 01:08:04.167
Fire!
Yay!

01:08:04.209 --> 01:08:05.710
Thank you, Caleb.
That was great.
Whoo!

01:08:05.752 --> 01:08:07.253
All right, Mara.

01:08:07.295 --> 01:08:08.922
* Hello *

01:08:08.963 --> 01:08:11.257
We sang together,
actually, in the blind.
Oh, wow.

01:08:11.299 --> 01:08:16.596
* I give you all of me *

01:08:16.638 --> 01:08:18.807
Get away, get away.
[ Laughter ]

01:08:18.848 --> 01:08:20.225
Niall was very jealous.

01:08:20.266 --> 01:08:21.935
He really wanted her
on his team.

01:08:21.976 --> 01:08:24.437
So we're very excited
to hear from Mara.

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:26.940
What did you choose
to sing, Mara?

01:08:26.981 --> 01:08:30.235
I chose to sing "Without You"
by Harry Nilsson,

01:08:30.276 --> 01:08:31.695
the Mariah Carey version.

01:08:31.736 --> 01:08:33.780
That's a serious song,
too.
Wow.

01:08:33.822 --> 01:08:35.615
I know.
You are not shy.

01:08:35.657 --> 01:08:38.702
One of my earliest memories
growing up

01:08:38.743 --> 01:08:41.579
was my mom,
when she would cook,

01:08:41.621 --> 01:08:43.540
she would always have music on,

01:08:43.581 --> 01:08:45.834
and this song came on.

01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:49.629
* No, I can't
forget this evening *

01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:52.465
I would literally watch
Mariah Carey's version

01:08:52.507 --> 01:08:56.302
over and over and over again,
and I would see, like,

01:08:56.344 --> 01:08:59.222
the crowd at the end,
and they would go crazy.

01:08:59.264 --> 01:09:03.560
And I just remember being
like -- like "I want that."

01:09:03.601 --> 01:09:06.479
To think that I'm finally
getting that moment,

01:09:06.521 --> 01:09:08.023
it makes me emotional.

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:11.151
John: Mara has such a great
voice, such a great tone.

01:09:11.192 --> 01:09:13.528
I love how she's so tethered
to the classics

01:09:13.570 --> 01:09:15.405
and some of those great songs

01:09:15.447 --> 01:09:17.032
that have endured
for a long time.

01:09:17.073 --> 01:09:21.036
* I can't live *

01:09:21.077 --> 01:09:22.662
* If living is without you *

01:09:22.704 --> 01:09:24.831
It gives her a chance
to wail and sing

01:09:24.873 --> 01:09:26.207
with passion and emotion.

01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:29.502
And I think she'll be great
with this song.

01:09:29.544 --> 01:09:31.421
Wow.

01:09:31.463 --> 01:09:33.965
Ooh!
John: Beautiful.

01:09:34.007 --> 01:09:37.010
I think it's really hard
to sing that low

01:09:37.052 --> 01:09:38.553
and that high
all in the same song.

01:09:38.595 --> 01:09:40.680
Uh-huh. It's so hard.
I'm so with you.

01:09:40.722 --> 01:09:43.767
I'm a mom and a grandmother,
so I want to come up there

01:09:43.808 --> 01:09:46.436
and just take you
and just do this.

01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:49.814
My life coach does this to me
and just says, "Breathe."

01:09:49.856 --> 01:09:52.108
It was a little strained
at times.
Mm-hmm.

01:09:52.150 --> 01:09:53.860
And you have to
take your time, too.

01:09:53.902 --> 01:09:56.613
I think even fewer runs
than what you were doing.

01:09:56.654 --> 01:09:58.406
I'm always like,
less is more with runs.

01:09:58.448 --> 01:10:01.201
And squeeze your butt.
I do that when I hit high notes.

01:10:01.242 --> 01:10:02.535
Yeah, honestly.
Squeeze your butt.

01:10:02.577 --> 01:10:03.870
It actually helps.

01:10:03.912 --> 01:10:05.663
My coach says do front
and back support,

01:10:05.705 --> 01:10:07.207
and back support
is your butt.
Yes.

01:10:07.248 --> 01:10:08.750
Hup!
[ Laughter ]

01:10:08.792 --> 01:10:10.335
We're getting gems
over here.

01:10:10.377 --> 01:10:13.338
The thing that I need to focus
on in order to win this

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:17.133
is really taking my coach's
and Wynonna's advice

01:10:17.175 --> 01:10:22.389
and really, like, soaking that
in and then delivering it.

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.848
What a great group.

01:10:23.890 --> 01:10:25.225
Wynonna: I don't know how John
is gonna choose

01:10:25.266 --> 01:10:26.393
the one out of three.

01:10:26.434 --> 01:10:28.478
I don't envy him at all.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.522
I'm speechless, which is rare.

01:10:30.563 --> 01:10:32.691

01:23:08.488 --> 01:23:10.407
Niall, are you
a trained actor?

01:23:10.448 --> 01:23:13.243
Yea-- Yes.
[ Laughter ]

01:23:13.284 --> 01:23:14.911
Mara, day one,

01:23:14.953 --> 01:23:18.123
maybe apart from one other,
I'd say my favorite audition.

01:23:18.164 --> 01:23:20.750
I'll never forget it.
And John will tell you

01:23:20.792 --> 01:23:23.545
I hounded him
with text messages going,

01:23:23.586 --> 01:23:26.548
"I'm gonna
get you back for this."

01:23:26.589 --> 01:23:29.092
He was in mourning
for a day at least, yeah.

01:23:29.134 --> 01:23:32.679
When I think of who's great
on "The Voice" this season,

01:23:32.721 --> 01:23:34.389
you're the first one
that comes to mind.

01:23:34.431 --> 01:23:35.765
I'm telling you...
Thank you.

01:23:35.807 --> 01:23:37.559
...you've got something
serious about you.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:40.520
Daly: Wow.
You now have all the power.

01:23:40.562 --> 01:23:43.273
Mara, who do you pick
as your coach?

01:23:43.314 --> 01:23:44.566
[ Audience shouting ]

01:23:44.607 --> 01:23:47.527
Mara!
I got you!

01:23:50.989 --> 01:23:53.533
Uh...

01:23:53.575 --> 01:23:56.786
Ohhh, man.
All right.

01:23:56.828 --> 01:23:59.080
Um...

01:23:59.122 --> 01:24:01.916
