WEBVTT

00:04.270 --> 00:06.205
- Hey, brian,
you got a sec?

00:06.207 --> 00:08.173
- Yeah. I know
what you're gonna say.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.441
It's--it's all right.

00:09.443 --> 00:11.310
- No, I heard
you got in trouble.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.112
I feel awful.
- It's fine.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.413
It was my first slipup

00:14.415 --> 00:16.448
In nine years of miking you.
[phone rings]

00:16.450 --> 00:18.350
- Dunder mifflin.
This is erin.

00:18.352 --> 00:22.187
- Sure, anytime.
Uh, how about you and jim?

00:22.189 --> 00:26.425
Everything squared away?
- Yeah, mostly.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.394
- Pam, phone call.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.430
- Um, hey, say hi
to alyssa.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.332
- Will do.
- Okay. Thank you.

00:33.334 --> 00:35.367
- Sure.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.637
- Hey, boom guy.
- Oh, hey, meredith.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.105
- When are you
gonna boom me?

00:40.107 --> 00:41.573
- Listen,
they're cracking down on us

00:41.575 --> 00:43.108
Talking to the subjects.

00:43.110 --> 00:45.244
It's a lame rule,
but, you know, I wanna--

00:45.246 --> 00:48.313
I'll see you later.
- Got it.

00:56.189 --> 00:59.191
[cheerful music]

00:59.193 --> 01:07.332
â™ª

01:19.212 --> 01:22.181
- Hey, so I hear
you're bringing in some people

01:22.183 --> 01:24.216
To interview
for the sales job?

01:24.218 --> 01:26.218
- That's right,
a couple of old friends.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.553
Ballers only.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.089
Must be this cool
to ride.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.591
- Well, uh,
see, you raised it.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.759
- Oh, did I?

01:33.761 --> 01:35.394
Oh, yes, I did.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.663
Wallace is letting me hire
a junior sales associate

01:37.665 --> 01:39.832
To sit at jim's desk
while he's away in philly.

01:39.834 --> 01:43.168
Finally I'll have someone
at my desk clump who gets me.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.437
It's like, "really, jim?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.139
"you don't understand
the difference

01:47.141 --> 01:49.208
"between a slaughterhouse
and a rendering plant?

01:49.210 --> 01:50.843
"uh, remind me
not to lend you

01:50.845 --> 01:52.778
Any dead cows or horses."

01:52.780 --> 01:54.246
Wow.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.681
- You know what, man?
I deserve this job.

01:55.683 --> 01:58.183
- I scored
stone and son suit warehouse

01:58.185 --> 01:59.451
With you,
and god knows,

01:59.453 --> 02:01.186
To get the scranton white pages
with jan,

02:01.188 --> 02:02.721
I went above and beyond--

02:02.723 --> 02:04.256
And under.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.724
- You know what?

02:05.726 --> 02:08.160
You're gonna get
your interview, okay?

02:08.162 --> 02:09.428
I know
that you're going head-to-head

02:09.430 --> 02:10.562
Against some real superstars,

02:10.564 --> 02:12.531
But you got
a really good chance.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.366
Clark has no chance.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.202
I mean, he's up against
my buddy rolf, for god's sake.

02:17.204 --> 02:19.204
Guy goes fishing
with hand grenades.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.206
And trevor--
he'll make you laugh so hard,

02:21.208 --> 02:22.841
You'll puke your pants.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.276
- This sucks, you know?

02:24.278 --> 02:25.744
You put in
12 grueling weeks at a company,

02:25.746 --> 02:26.879
And what do they do?

02:26.881 --> 02:28.580
They make you compete
for a promotion,

02:28.582 --> 02:29.781
Like an animal.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.216
You know, I thought
this was an office,

02:31.218 --> 02:33.585
Not the thunderdome.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.754
- Big changes coming
to the old desk clump.

02:35.756 --> 02:39.258
No longer a pam-jim alliance
against dwight.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.861
Now it is dwight
and a friend axis against pam.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.830
- You could've just called that
an alliance too, right?

02:44.832 --> 02:47.432
- I chose my words
very carefully.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.802
- Things are a little delicate
with me and pam right now.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.671
And if my working
in philly

02:52.673 --> 02:54.540
Is gonna end up
doubling the dwight in her life,

02:54.542 --> 02:57.309
That's only gonna make
things worse.

02:57.311 --> 03:00.179
- [sighs]

03:02.415 --> 03:04.216
You interviewing
for the sales job too?

03:04.218 --> 03:06.218
- No. You're interviewing
for it.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.519
I'm getting it.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.887
- Well, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.422
I mean, I've been working here
12 weeks.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.324
That's a full season
of <i>homeland.</i>

03:12.326 --> 03:14.326
A ton of things can happen
in that amount of time,

03:14.328 --> 03:15.427
As we've seen.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.695
- I'm rolf.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.197
Rolf ahl.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.698
- Rolf ahl?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.700
Sounds kinda like
roald dahl.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.868
- Go to hell.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.269
- There he is.

03:24.271 --> 03:25.671
- Hey.
- Come on, buddy.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.373
Let's do this.
Sorry, rolf goes first.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.508
You don't compare.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.243
When you're
with the r-o-l-f

03:31.245 --> 03:34.546
You're literally
rolling on the laughing floor.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.315
- [laughs]
nice.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.450
- Rolf is my best friend,

03:38.452 --> 03:40.786
And he is the man.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.689
Cool, calm,
and collected 24/7.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.258
Just try and rattle rolf.
I dare you.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.260
Such a sweet guy.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.595
- When are you talking
to david wallace?

03:49.597 --> 03:50.762
- I'm talking to him
this afternoon,

03:50.764 --> 03:52.297
But don't get
your hopes up.

03:52.299 --> 03:53.699
- Too late.
My hopes are up.

03:53.701 --> 03:54.900
- Last week,
my company in philly

03:54.902 --> 03:56.335
Lost a big investor,
so we're scrambling

03:56.337 --> 03:59.705
Luckily, my partners
have a fix--

03:59.707 --> 04:02.708
Me asking the boss
of the company I'm abandoning

04:02.710 --> 04:05.644
To give us
a gigantic influx of cash.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.847
So...Problem solved.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.315
Thanks, guys.

04:10.317 --> 04:11.650
- And this chair's
gonna be yours.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.985
And this desk.
Ha!

04:12.987 --> 04:14.386
- I'm on the phone.
I'm on the phone.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.687
- No doy!

04:15.689 --> 04:18.657
- I'm just gonna
call you back. Thanks.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.025
[dwight knocking on desk]

04:20.027 --> 04:22.261
- I hope you like
norwegian black metal,

04:22.263 --> 04:24.329
Because I don't do earbuds.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.398
- [laughs]
no earbuds!

04:26.400 --> 04:29.768
[both laugh]

04:29.770 --> 04:31.336
- I'm sure
he's just nervous.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.305
- [sighs]
it's fine.

04:33.307 --> 04:36.308
It's just a seating arrangement.
Doesn't matter.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.346
- So I've got
your resume here,

04:41.348 --> 04:43.015
But it's not
telling me everything.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.916
- Well, a lot
of that information is private.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.386
How do I know you're qualified
to evaluate me?

04:47.388 --> 04:48.854
- Well, I'm the one
offering the job.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.289
- What are your credentials?

04:50.291 --> 04:51.590
- I've worked here
for 12 years.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.891
I won
salesman of the year.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.761
- I think I've heard
everything I need to hear.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.729
- Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean,
if you need to know more,

04:57.731 --> 04:59.631
You can call david wallace.
I'm sure he'd give a reference.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.068
- Thank you, dwight.
I'll be in touch.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.038
- Well, they can't
all be winners.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.041
But trevor's next,
and he's a real professional.

05:09.043 --> 05:12.044
You say, "jump,"
and he says, "on who?"

05:12.046 --> 05:15.747
He loves to jump on people,
that trevor.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.349
What makes you think
you'd be

05:17.351 --> 05:18.850
An effective paper salesman?

05:18.852 --> 05:20.752
- Ooh, okay.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.988
Didn't see
that one coming.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.489
Can I take a 20 on that?

05:24.491 --> 05:26.358
Maybe we can circle
back around to it.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.926
- Well,
it's a pretty basic question

05:27.928 --> 05:29.761
For a potential
paper salesman.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.763
- Pass.
Next one.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.098
- All right.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.067
Do you see yourself
as more of a team player

05:35.069 --> 05:36.668
Or a self-starter?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.438
- No, no, and no.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.074
- There were
only two options.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.409
- Checkmate.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.346
You win this one,
my friend.

05:47.348 --> 05:50.849
Do you validate parking?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.017
- This is a bus transfer.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.454
- [chuckles]
nothing gets by this guy.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.958
- Hey, jim,
do you mind

05:59.960 --> 06:01.626
If I look over these price
sheets before my interview?

06:01.628 --> 06:02.661
- Sure, yeah, go ahead.

06:02.663 --> 06:05.364
- Thanks, dude.

06:08.801 --> 06:11.603
You--you sure it's okay?
'cause you're kinda--

06:11.605 --> 06:13.138
- Yeah, absolutely.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.973
Do people like
sitting next to you?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.074
You're clean, right?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.377
- Oh, dove men.
- Nice.

06:18.379 --> 06:21.146
Music. Do you listen to it
in earbuds?

06:21.148 --> 06:23.882
You don't listen to it at all
because we're at work,

06:23.884 --> 06:25.684
Not a florence
and the machine concert, so--

06:25.686 --> 06:29.154
- Yeah, could I just have
a minute to prepare for this?

06:29.156 --> 06:31.089
- Sure, yeah.
Do whatever you need to do.

06:31.091 --> 06:35.794
- Right after you
do one thing for me.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.562
I need you
to breathe in my face.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.133
- I need you to breathe
in my face right now.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.402
- [exhales]

06:43.404 --> 06:45.170
- What are we working with,
peppermint or wintergreen?

06:45.172 --> 06:48.607
- I knew it, I knew it.
- Yeah, good nose.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.608
- I looked at you
coming around,

06:49.610 --> 06:50.842
And I said, "wintergreen."

06:50.844 --> 06:52.411
- I can't hire clark.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.413
Yeah, he looks like
a schrute,

06:54.415 --> 06:55.580
But he thinks like
a halpert

06:55.582 --> 06:58.116
And he acts like a beesly.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.684
Okay, here's one.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.887
A customer who ordered
enough paper to qualify

07:01.889 --> 07:03.054
For a volume discount
now wants

07:03.056 --> 07:04.723
To return half the stock.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.525
You can't rebate
the sales price

07:06.527 --> 07:08.927
Or credit
for future purchases

07:08.929 --> 07:12.531
Because you brokered the deal
for a third party.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.099
- That's just
a classic no-win situation.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.635
- Thank you.
- So I'd kobayashi maru it.

07:16.637 --> 07:19.871
- Damn it!
Perfect answer, again.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.540
- Yep.
- Think, dwight, think.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.742
You have a ream
of 16-bond...

07:23.744 --> 07:25.076
- You know what, dwight?
- And anoth--

07:25.078 --> 07:27.846
- This interview's over,
and I get the job.

07:27.848 --> 07:31.082
I just kobayashi maru'd
the whole process.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.751
- No.
- Yeah.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.019
<i>Star trek</i> rules.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.154
- It does, but still no.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.089
- Come on, man.
I mean, did trevor do that?

07:38.091 --> 07:39.758
Did rolf do that?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.793
- Oh, you think
they're my only friends?

07:41.795 --> 07:45.230
And they're all better
than the losers who work here.

07:45.232 --> 07:51.503
[all murmuring]

07:53.506 --> 07:56.908
- This is not natural.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.814
- Just--I don't wanna
make assumptions

08:02.816 --> 08:04.649
Based on people's
physical appearances.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.184
- Of course not.
But does physical appearance

08:06.186 --> 08:07.219
Include smell?

08:07.221 --> 08:08.954
- They smell so bad.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.590
- If I ever get that bad,
you'd tell me, right?

08:11.592 --> 08:13.692
- Meredith,
I tell you all the time.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.962
- [chuckles]
walked right into that one.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.731
- Next up, my cousin mose.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.500
Mose could make
a great paper salesman.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.834
He's got a natural
fear of paper,

08:22.836 --> 08:24.236
Which would motivate him
to get as much of it

08:24.238 --> 08:25.770
Out of this office
as possible.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.707
I've got big expectations,
mose-wise.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.510
What quality would make you
a good sales associate?

08:31.512 --> 08:32.844
- People person.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.880
- It says here on your resume
that you spent

08:34.882 --> 08:37.949
The last 15 years
as a sales rep for dow chemical.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.117
- That's right.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.719
- You know
we live together, right?

08:40.721 --> 08:42.654
- Yes.
- And I've never seen you

08:42.656 --> 08:44.723
Go to work, ever.

08:44.725 --> 08:45.957
- Okay.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.060
- So why is this
on your resume?

08:53.165 --> 08:54.232
[door slams]

09:12.852 --> 09:14.819
- So how'd you guys
hear about the position?

09:14.821 --> 09:18.557
Dwight called my house,
but he didn't realize

09:18.559 --> 09:20.191
That I had already
moved out,

09:20.193 --> 09:22.227
Because my mom
and I are quarrelling

09:22.229 --> 09:24.896
Because I-I can't
stay out of her stuff.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.598
- Dwight's my cousin,

09:26.600 --> 09:28.266
So I overhead him
telling my brother mose

09:28.268 --> 09:30.735
About the job opportunity
in the shower.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.737
- You were in the shower
or he was in the shower?

09:32.739 --> 09:33.972
- Everyone was in the shower.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.740
It's a cow shower,
so there's, like,

09:35.742 --> 09:37.876
A ton of people in there.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.611
- So you guys
all know dwight already?

09:39.613 --> 09:40.845
- I was his babysitter,

09:40.847 --> 09:42.814
And then we dated
for a while.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.683
He was a passionate lover

09:44.685 --> 09:46.818
And the sweetest
little baby.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.020
- I knew you
looked familiar.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.156
You used to pick up dwight
from school.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.758
- You went to x-men school too?

09:53.760 --> 09:54.893
[exhales]

09:54.895 --> 09:56.628
- X-men school?

09:56.630 --> 09:58.196
- When I was young,
I spent several years

09:58.198 --> 10:00.665
At a private school
where I was told

10:00.667 --> 10:02.968
I would be taught to harness
my mutant abilities.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.669
Turned out it was a conman

10:04.671 --> 10:07.772
Copying charles xavier's
school for gifted youngsters

10:07.774 --> 10:09.674
From the x-men comic books.

10:09.676 --> 10:13.144
Took me years
to figure out that it was con.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.747
Some people
never figured it out.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.082
- Oh, I have a few powers.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.350
Night hearing.

10:18.352 --> 10:20.385
Dogs understand
where I point.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.687
And our training included
picking carrots,

10:22.689 --> 10:26.658
Scrubbing tubs,
sewing imitation levi's.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.193
A lot of telemarketing.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.363
- I don't wanna sit near
any of those people

10:31.365 --> 10:32.764
For the next 20 years.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.265
Someone say something.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.834
- I said something
when they were

10:35.836 --> 10:36.701
Thinking of hiring jim.

10:36.703 --> 10:37.769
Didn't work then.

10:37.771 --> 10:40.071
And now look
what he's doing to us.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.740
- Yeah, jim,
this is all your fault.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.742
- How is it my fault?
- Here's an exercise

10:43.744 --> 10:47.746
Imagine there are
consequences to your actions.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.748
Imagine the whole world
does not

10:49.750 --> 10:51.683
Revolve around this.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.385
There are others.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.754
- But it's dwight who's
bringing in all the weirdos.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.355
- Yeah, but, jim,
dwight's a weirdo.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.724
We can't blame a weirdo
for bringing in weirdos.

10:59.726 --> 11:02.160
We can blame a normal
for creating a situation

11:02.162 --> 11:04.763
Where a weirdo was allowed
to bring in weirdos.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.164
- Hey, I'm the one
who has to sit

11:06.166 --> 11:08.266
Next to this weirdo
when jim's away.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.402
I'm in a position
where I'm rooting for nate,

11:10.404 --> 11:14.139
And that just
feels wrong.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.141
[sighs]
forget it.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.343
I need to work
on my mural.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.713
I have some pointy trees
that I need to round off.

11:29.956 --> 11:33.358
- Yeah, this is actually
about the new sales guy.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.927
Dwight has brought in
a bunch of real weirdos.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.196
And I was wondering
if I could have some input--

11:38.198 --> 11:40.098
- This is dwight schrute.
Who am I speaking to?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.766
And don't lie.
I can tell if you're lying.

11:41.768 --> 11:42.967
- Hey, dwight.
It's david.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.469
- David.
- Jim says he'd like

11:44.471 --> 11:46.971
Some say
in the hiring process.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.107
- Really?
That's interesting.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.109
'cause I was thinking
that since

11:51.111 --> 11:55.080
He might not be as invested
in the decision making process

11:55.082 --> 11:57.015
As someone like me
who's here every day

11:57.017 --> 11:58.717
And, frankly,
killing it lately.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.151
- I was just thinking
that because this person

12:00.153 --> 12:02.821
Is gonna be sitting
at my desk, near my wife--

12:02.823 --> 12:04.022
- Jim, another thing.

12:04.024 --> 12:07.792
This junior sales associate
to cover for you,

12:07.794 --> 12:09.127
I am going to have
to pay you

12:09.129 --> 12:12.497
Only for the days
that you actually work.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.200
- Oh. Um--
- yeah.

12:15.202 --> 12:18.169
- Okay. I can't say
that that's not fair.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.172
- And I know we have
a call scheduled for later--

12:21.174 --> 12:22.774
- Oh, yeah, so we'll just
do that later.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.109
- No. Why not do it now?

12:24.111 --> 12:26.211
- Yeah. What's up, jim?

12:26.213 --> 12:28.179
- Uh--
[clears throat]

12:28.181 --> 12:30.415
Well, it's about athlead.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.750
I'm sorry.
Does dwight have to be

12:31.752 --> 12:32.851
On this part
of the phone call?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.152
- I'd love to be
in the loop, david.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.122
- It's okay.
Go ahead, jim.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.257
- There's a very
exciting opportunity

12:39.259 --> 12:41.192
To be a core investor--
- okay.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.861
Jim, I'm gonna
have to stop you right there.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.830
- Yes, okay. Bye.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.034
- [whispers]
I'd love to invest.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.169
- No, thanks.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.138
- I'd like to give you
$100 million.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.773
[snickers]

12:54.775 --> 12:59.244
[phone ringing]

13:01.480 --> 13:04.916
- Why you make trees
into bushes?

13:04.918 --> 13:07.285
You don't make paper
from bushes.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.088
- Hide, they're giving out
jobs upstairs.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.189
Why don't you go up
and get one?

13:11.191 --> 13:13.124
- Thank you.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.460
- Yeah.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.366
[hand dryer whirring]

13:21.368 --> 13:24.202
- Whoops.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.211
- It's dense,
like bread.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.581
[chip crunches]

13:38.517 --> 13:40.118
- Dwight, you can't
just hire someone

13:40.120 --> 13:42.120
'cause they're your friend.
- I'm not.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.855
These people are the best
of the best.

13:43.857 --> 13:46.224
I find talent an attractive
quality in a friend.

13:46.226 --> 13:47.559
- They're freaks, dwight.

13:47.561 --> 13:50.228
All your friends
are weirdos and freaks.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.030
- You know who else
was a freak?

13:52.032 --> 13:53.464
Spider-man.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.233
And he was also a hero.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.135
- Your friends
are like spider-man,

13:57.137 --> 13:59.070
If he had gotten bitten
by a spider

13:59.072 --> 14:02.173
And then got really into
masturbating.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.409
- Man, how cool is it gonna be
when I start working here?

14:04.411 --> 14:06.010
Paintball fights at lunch.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.946
- Mandatory paintball.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.247
Uh, wolf, please report
to the parking lot

14:09.249 --> 14:11.115
For mandatory paintball
at lunch.

14:11.117 --> 14:12.183
Wolf is hilarious.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.985
He has executed me
over 100 times

14:13.987 --> 14:15.186
At point-blank range.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.021
Half of 'em,
we were on the same team.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.924
Oh, my god.
How I screamed.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.192
Ah, that goof.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.562
Sell me this piece of paper.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.930
Watch this.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.131
- Do you want this paper?

14:27.133 --> 14:28.266
- I sure do.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.235
- It's not very good.

14:30.237 --> 14:31.636
- I will pay you
whatever it takes.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.171
- I think I wanna
keep it now.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.373
It must be pretty special
if you want it so bad.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.975
- No, you have lots
of other pieces of paper

14:36.977 --> 14:38.142
That are just like it.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.244
So here, just take my money.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.646
Okay, read my lips.
It's over.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.248
- Okay, good.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.148
That was great.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.150
So, wow.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.518
You're still at
the 570 number?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.220
- I am.
- Okay.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.655
Good, good, good.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.657
[sighs]

14:52.659 --> 14:55.126
- I have eight years
experience

14:55.128 --> 14:58.162
Selling electronics
in sanyo store

14:58.164 --> 14:59.931
In downtown tokyo.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.099
I was a doctor.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.567
And I have a business degree

15:02.569 --> 15:06.237
From tokyo university.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.307
- This isn't gonna work out.

15:10.910 --> 15:13.478
- Thank you.
[chuckles]

15:16.181 --> 15:20.184
- Nate is a proven entity,
but not without his handicaps:

15:20.186 --> 15:22.453
Hearing, vision,
basic cognition.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.657
Trevor is great,
but I saw no fire in him today.

15:25.659 --> 15:28.192
And this is a guy
who loves to start fires.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.628
Troy is literally
one of a kind.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.230
He's a goblin, or a hobbit,

15:32.232 --> 15:35.099
Or a kobold,
which is a type of gremlin.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.935
And yet I'm hesitant.

15:36.937 --> 15:40.004
Why I can't I pull the trigger
on any of them?

15:40.006 --> 15:43.541
[groaning]
no, no, no.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.643
I just need to tell them.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.245
I just need
to tell them.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.315
[knock at door]

15:50.317 --> 15:52.383
- Do you need to be changed?

15:52.385 --> 15:54.252
- I do that myself now.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.420
- Mm.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.388
Are you going
to make a decision soon?

15:57.390 --> 15:59.324
I've been double-parked
for five hours.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.392
I'm wondering if I should
move my car.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.294
- No, you've been
towed by now.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.530
They tow after
about 45 minutes.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.031
- Well, the joke's on them.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.133
I live right next
to the tow yard.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.303
All they did
was save me some gas.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.706
- Hey, man, we get
how difficult this is.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.140
And no matter
who you choose,

16:16.142 --> 16:17.475
We're still gonna
be your friend.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.243
- Yeah, whether it's me
or troy underbridge,

16:19.245 --> 16:21.045
Or gabor, or melvina--

16:21.047 --> 16:22.180
- Or none of you.
[chuckles]

16:22.182 --> 16:25.183
Put us through the wringer,
and then choose none of us.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.251
- Can you imagine
how insulting that would be?

16:27.253 --> 16:29.354
The contempt
that a person like that

16:29.356 --> 16:31.222
Would have to have for you.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.491
- I wish I could
hire all of you.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.461
- I could start Monday.

16:38.630 --> 16:40.732
- Psst.
Jim.

16:40.734 --> 16:43.701
Jim?

16:43.703 --> 16:46.237
Jim, turn around.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.206
Jim, turn around.
Jim, turn around.

16:48.208 --> 16:51.109
- Ahh, I love staring off
in one direction.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.411
If I'm not looking south,
I'm not livin'.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.179
That's what I always say.

16:57.282 --> 17:00.284
- Just act natural.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.620
[grunts]

17:06.792 --> 17:09.660
And I was thinking
it's only fair that you

17:09.662 --> 17:11.662
Help make this decision
since they'll be sitting

17:11.664 --> 17:14.198
At your desk,
next to your wife.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.300
- But you know I wouldn't hire
any of these all-stars.

17:16.302 --> 17:17.735
- Aah!

17:17.737 --> 17:20.505
God, that sucks!
Aah!

17:20.507 --> 17:21.672
What are you gonna do?

17:21.674 --> 17:23.441
I mean, it's your call.
- Nope.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.777
Your friends not turning out
to be as great as you thought?

17:25.779 --> 17:27.178
Not even gabor?

17:27.180 --> 17:28.546
- I guess I just have
higher standards

17:28.548 --> 17:31.115
For my work colleagues
than for my friends.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.650
I just couldn't
picture any of them

17:32.652 --> 17:34.285
In the old gold and gray.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.188
You designed a uniform
for dunder mifflin.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.158
- Summer. Winter.

17:40.160 --> 17:44.295
Jungle. Formal.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.730
- Well, I, for one,
was amazed

17:45.732 --> 17:47.799
At how qualified
everyone was. You?

17:47.801 --> 17:49.367
- Yes. Thank you.
- Amazed.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.536
And I gotta say,
this was a tough decision.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.572
And we had to go with
none of you.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.275
- I'm sorry?
- What?

17:57.277 --> 18:00.078
This is such bullcrap!

18:00.080 --> 18:01.612
- Well, you know,
wallace put me in charge,

18:01.614 --> 18:02.780
So you have no say.

18:02.782 --> 18:05.183
- Wow.
So much crap.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.351
It's just a load of b.C.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.787
How could you do this
to them?

18:09.789 --> 18:14.192
- Do we get our resumes back
or do you keep them?

18:14.194 --> 18:16.327
Because I only
have the one,

18:16.329 --> 18:18.229
And I have a chili recipe
on the back

18:18.231 --> 18:20.098
That I really wanna keep.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.200
- Okay, this is an outrage.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.168
Ugh!
You know what?

18:24.170 --> 18:25.837
This is jim halpert's
home address,

18:25.839 --> 18:27.171
In case you guys wanna

18:27.173 --> 18:28.372
Toilet paper his house
or whatever.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.208
- That seems inconsiderate.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.343
- No. We get it.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.313
Thanks so much
for the opportunity, dwight.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.249
Don't open any suspicious
packages you may receive.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.184
No, wait.
Do open them.

18:40.186 --> 18:42.186
Totally safe.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.821
- Guys, it wasn't up to me.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.858
Rolf, come on.
Guys, it wasn't my choice!

18:46.860 --> 18:48.326
I would've hired
all of you!

18:48.328 --> 18:50.495
Gabor, gabor.

18:50.497 --> 18:51.896
- Well, my day's shot.

18:51.898 --> 18:55.233
To start a slow roast
and too early for a swanson's.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.535
- I got it.
Paintball.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.636
- Oh, that sounds awesome.

18:58.638 --> 19:02.240
- [yells] and what are we
supposed to do until then?

19:02.242 --> 19:03.808
- Okay.
- Let's just go, you guys.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.145
- Yeah. No limit
on weapons class, right?

19:12.317 --> 19:15.386
- All right.
I think that went well.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.525
So, uh, if you just
take a look at this,

19:20.527 --> 19:22.226
And then that'll print out--
hey.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.494
Meet your new desk mate.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.596
- What's up, good-lookin'?
- Oh, cool.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.165
Hey, clark.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.200
- Trust me, this is the least
of all evils.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.235
It took me all day
to pull this off,

19:31.237 --> 19:32.703
So you should be thrilled,
considering.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.338
- Yeah, I guess.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.241
I mean, I kinda liked
my old desk mate.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.177
- Okay.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.344
I'm really sorry
I told the guys

19:40.346 --> 19:42.380
I'd be there
for the board meeting.

19:42.382 --> 19:43.581
- Of course.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.615
- I'll call you
when I get there.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.750
- All right. Bye.

19:45.752 --> 19:46.784
- All right.
Take care of my wife.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.919
I will be back.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.754
[computer chimes]

19:57.496 --> 19:59.430
- They say that everyone
outgrows their friends

19:59.432 --> 20:01.199
At some point
in their lives.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.634
Well, I just
outgrew them all

20:03.636 --> 20:06.671
In the span of three hours.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.272
- Hey, pam,
I'm going to the kitchen.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.274
You want anything?
- I'm good.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.375
- Oh, hey,
I'll take a coffee.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.610
- Oh, I'm sorry.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.746
You gotta be
this cool for coffee.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.787
- [scoffs]

20:24.923 --> 20:25.990
- Hey, dwight.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.559
Wanna haze the new guy?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.228
- Who, me?

20:30.230 --> 20:31.996
- Us.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.298
- Absolutely, I do.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.300
- [giggles]
okay.

20:36.302 --> 20:39.637
Okay, here.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.306
Okay, so the next time
he goes to the bathroom,

20:42.308 --> 20:43.975
I'll distract him,
you take that.

20:43.977 --> 20:46.277
- Okay, yeah,
I know what to do. Okay.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.679
Oh, that's great.
- [shushes]

20:48.681 --> 20:51.382
- [laughs]

20:55.288 --> 20:58.689
- Welcome to the club, pig!
[laughs]

20:58.691 --> 21:02.426
- No, dwight!
- Aah!

21:02.428 --> 21:03.794
- No, it does matter
who ends up

21:03.796 --> 21:05.596
Sitting next to pam
when I'm gone.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.531
The people around you
are basically

21:07.533 --> 21:09.700
Who you end up
spending your life with.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.636
I mean, because of where
my desk was,

21:11.638 --> 21:13.704
I spent all those years
looking at pam,

21:13.706 --> 21:15.006
And I fell in love.

21:15.008 --> 21:19.277
So, that stuff matters.
Definitely does.
