DISTRIBUTION YEAR 1959

06:10.931 --> 06:12.367
<i>Vera,</i>

06:12.544 --> 06:14.220
<i>my love,</i>

06:15.513 --> 06:18.863
<i>I forgot to send you the letter.</i>

06:19.792 --> 06:23.340
<i>Blame it on the insane spring flooding
of the Siberian rivers.</i>

06:23.843 --> 06:27.511
<i>We landed practically in the water.</i>

06:27.644 --> 06:30.727
<i>In the confusion, I missed the chance,</i>

06:30.860 --> 06:32.733
<i>and then the plane was gone.</i>

06:32.953 --> 06:38.087
<i>I began this letter when still on the plane.</i>

06:40.432 --> 06:45.186
<i>I remembered our parting.</i>

07:05.355 --> 07:07.295
<i>And I remembered</i>

07:07.401 --> 07:11.967
<i>how we sat down in the hallway,</i>

07:12.212 --> 07:19.408
<i>and I saw love and anxiety
in your eyes.</i>

07:25.795 --> 07:29.729
<i>Leaving you always makes me sad.</i>

07:30.393 --> 07:33.361
<i>But some unstoppable force</i>

07:33.568 --> 07:37.068
<i>drives me again and again.</i>

07:43.590 --> 07:46.729
<i>I am even glad that I
didn't send the letter.</i>

07:46.883 --> 07:50.076
<i>Now at every rest stop</i>

07:50.356 --> 07:54.485
<i>I will write to you about everything</i>

07:54.894 --> 07:59.049
<i>that fills our nomadic days
in the taiga.</i>

08:01.424 --> 08:04.108
<i>Sergey is again our guide.</i>

08:04.570 --> 08:07.540
<i>And the geologists are
very young this time.</i>

08:07.673 --> 08:09.375
<i>He and she.</i>

08:10.015 --> 08:12.075
<i>They must be in love,</i>

08:12.441 --> 08:15.257
<i>although they take pains to hide it.</i>

08:15.577 --> 08:18.315
<i>But I can see it.</i>

08:29.632 --> 08:34.757
<i>Some day
I will talk you into going with us.</i>

08:35.656 --> 08:39.094
<i>Because if you were near, my happiness</i>

08:39.234 --> 08:43.299
<i>would have been complete.</i>

08:47.125 --> 08:48.663
<i>Here,</i>

08:48.877 --> 08:51.082
<i>between two rivers,</i>

08:51.195 --> 08:53.722
<i>we'll begin our work.</i>

09:09.759 --> 09:12.192
The first step is the hardest.

09:13.824 --> 09:15.156
Come sit here.

09:15.820 --> 09:19.836
I prefer the saying
"All's well that ends well".

09:20.415 --> 09:23.038
Let's drink to making a start.

09:25.638 --> 09:28.656
- To making a start.
- To making a start.

09:41.483 --> 09:43.089
Kostya...

09:44.662 --> 09:46.991
Shall we finish it?

09:47.265 --> 09:53.849
Guys... the rest of it we'll drink
when we find the diamonds.

09:54.446 --> 09:56.948
- Got it?
- To celebrate.

09:57.081 --> 09:59.472
Or to mourn, if we don't find them.

09:59.555 --> 10:02.484
Any reason for drinking
is a good reason.

10:04.208 --> 10:07.185
Andrey, get Moscow for a few minutes.

10:21.876 --> 10:23.296
Cut it out.

10:25.476 --> 10:27.670
Base will be calling in a moment.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.882
Kostya! Base here.

10:39.662 --> 10:42.775
Octahedron here. Let me.

10:43.648 --> 10:45.743
This is Sabinin.

10:46.211 --> 10:49.797
We have reached search area.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.541
Optimistic and full of hopes.

10:53.796 --> 10:57.254
We're starting the search. Over.

11:17.648 --> 11:20.821
Look, what an interesting sample.

11:30.761 --> 11:32.289
Andrey.

11:32.762 --> 11:35.894
Do you have a feeling
like dreams could come true?

11:36.197 --> 11:37.881
Meaning?

11:38.152 --> 11:40.877
In college, we used to dream

11:41.557 --> 11:45.242
of diamonds, Arizona rubies, ilmenites...

11:45.360 --> 11:48.050
This is my 10th diamond expedition.

11:48.195 --> 11:51.118
They don't exist. A mirage.

11:54.852 --> 11:57.834
The scientists maintain

11:58.024 --> 12:01.353
that the Mid-Siberian plateau

12:01.835 --> 12:07.060
is geologically very similar
to the South African plateau.

12:07.187 --> 12:10.054
And that's where the
richest diamond deposits are.

12:10.164 --> 12:14.991
Give your scientists mosquito nets
and send them into the bogs.

12:15.076 --> 12:18.671
That would put a stop to their theories.

12:31.145 --> 12:33.664
What is it, Sergey Stepanovich?

12:44.261 --> 12:46.194
Why the silence?

12:53.519 --> 12:55.212
A mirage,

12:56.133 --> 12:58.539
Tatiana Nikolayevna.

13:02.307 --> 13:04.688
You think it's all so easy?

13:04.982 --> 13:06.421
No, why?

13:09.964 --> 13:12.765
Nature guards its secrets

13:13.160 --> 13:15.093
rather jealously,

13:15.212 --> 13:19.175
and only perseverance
can wrench them from her grasp.

13:20.226 --> 13:22.245
And bravery, if you like.

13:22.360 --> 13:26.450
But we'll search for them, and search,

13:26.686 --> 13:28.870
and search again...

15:16.199 --> 15:18.112
Hiding?

15:19.102 --> 15:22.237
- No luck.
- That may change.

15:22.406 --> 15:25.737
Great discoveries demand great patience.

15:25.849 --> 15:28.236
What if we do find the diamonds?

15:28.358 --> 15:30.896
An industrial revolution.

15:32.010 --> 15:34.083
- How marvelous.
- It's nice to be in the taiga.

15:34.207 --> 15:37.655
We'll find them and we'll be
happy for the rest of our lives.

15:37.962 --> 15:39.949
You know, Tanya,

15:40.977 --> 15:42.985
I dislike the noise of the big cities.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.832
Everybody running, in a hurry.
What if one could...

15:47.110 --> 15:48.952
live here, always?

15:49.912 --> 15:51.680
No. I don't want to.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.132
I don't want to,

15:54.574 --> 15:56.685
I don't want to!
I don't want to! I don't want to!

15:56.772 --> 15:59.485
I don't want to!
I don't want to! I don't want to!

16:00.110 --> 16:04.719
I love the mad and exuberant Moscow â€“
guests, noise, dancing...

16:04.834 --> 16:08.511
Dancing, dancing, dancing.

16:14.226 --> 16:15.348
Do you love me?

16:15.453 --> 16:18.152
- I love Geology College, Lenin Hills--
- No, <i>me</i>?

16:18.235 --> 16:21.511
- The mad and exuberant Moscow--
- What about <i>me</i>?

16:21.605 --> 16:26.437
Our house, the streets...
Granny and ice-cream!

16:30.272 --> 16:33.146
"Every time I promise myself to tell you,

16:33.229 --> 16:36.689
"and every time I go numb inside from fear."

16:36.791 --> 16:38.715
- Don't, Andrey.
- "You love ano..."

16:38.798 --> 16:41.245
Sergey Stepanovich wrote this.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.902
- He's in love with somebody, imagine that!
- Don't.

16:45.036 --> 16:46.450
Guys.

16:46.584 --> 16:49.830
- Is my map case here?
- Right here.

16:50.070 --> 16:51.867
- Take it.
- Thanks.

16:51.999 --> 16:54.033
And you lost this, too.

16:56.062 --> 16:57.707
Not me.

16:57.993 --> 17:00.487
Wasn't it you who wrote this?

17:00.726 --> 17:02.727
I wrote nothing.

17:02.940 --> 17:07.443
- I thought I knew your handwriting.
- You don't, yet.

17:09.888 --> 17:13.609
I don't get it why you are so annoyed.

17:20.671 --> 17:24.165
I don't want you to get it.

17:29.771 --> 17:31.688
Embarrassing.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.314
You know, Sergey...

17:48.480 --> 17:50.333
you should get married.

17:50.534 --> 17:52.733
You're getting misanthropic.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.125
And what have I seen in life?

17:56.326 --> 17:58.845
The war. The forest.

18:00.163 --> 18:03.378
Walking the taiga, looking for...

18:03.524 --> 18:06.329
other men's treasures.

18:06.817 --> 18:08.799
You're silly.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.838
I know.

18:14.720 --> 18:15.946
So,

18:16.113 --> 18:19.133
love is rarer than diamonds?

18:19.862 --> 18:22.433
Here's another schlich.

18:25.155 --> 18:27.010
Sergey Stepanovich...

18:29.713 --> 18:33.744
somebody promised to take me hunting.

18:38.496 --> 18:40.003
Well, then.

18:51.677 --> 18:53.228
Terrific!

19:00.140 --> 19:01.900
Did you read the note?

19:03.024 --> 19:04.135
Yes.

19:04.255 --> 19:05.589
Figured it out?

19:05.688 --> 19:07.355
I think so.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.339
What do you say?

19:11.529 --> 19:14.201
- Me? It's your business.
- But still.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.301
- You'll get angry again.
- No, let's talk.

19:17.384 --> 19:18.996
Like men?

19:20.609 --> 19:21.681
Like men.

19:21.763 --> 19:22.956
Sergey Stepanovich,

19:23.038 --> 19:27.469
you love a girl who loves another.
And he loves her.

19:27.579 --> 19:30.449
Morally... that's wrong.

19:30.532 --> 19:32.664
I don't give a damn about
your morals from books.

19:32.746 --> 19:35.174
- I care about my feelings.
- That's an egoist talking.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.404
So I'm an egoist.

19:39.925 --> 19:41.488
That's for sure.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.981
What are <i>you</i> going to do?

19:51.673 --> 19:53.258
Not give up.

19:53.652 --> 19:56.438
I waited all my life for this feeling.

19:56.798 --> 19:58.314
I understand.

19:58.628 --> 20:00.552
But that's how man

20:00.654 --> 20:02.654
is different from animal:

20:02.778 --> 20:06.906
he can suppress the wrong feelings.

20:10.816 --> 20:13.848
A fish. A cold large-headed fish.

20:13.950 --> 20:16.771
Why does Tatiana love such a mosquito?

20:31.997 --> 20:33.350
This...

20:34.203 --> 20:36.369
is not the way to behave.

20:36.914 --> 20:40.354
It was you who insisted
on having this conversation.

20:40.484 --> 20:42.348
You asked me questions.

20:42.514 --> 20:45.134
Maybe I talked too much.

20:45.894 --> 20:49.051
I don't know the girl you wrote to.

20:49.444 --> 20:50.834
But...

20:51.527 --> 20:53.928
if you love her,

20:54.201 --> 20:57.375
don't show her this side of you.

21:00.706 --> 21:02.253
Wait!

21:04.841 --> 21:07.205
Did you read the note?

21:10.613 --> 21:12.298
I told you.

21:12.608 --> 21:13.738
Yes.

21:14.081 --> 21:17.027
Don't treat me like an idiot.

21:37.214 --> 21:40.481
Tanya! Grab the trophy.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.136
My heart was aching, like I was afraid.

21:46.068 --> 21:47.471
No reason for that.

21:47.554 --> 21:50.866
We had a great hunt
and talked a lot.

21:51.090 --> 21:53.366
What did you talk about?

21:54.218 --> 21:56.429
Men's stuff.

21:57.517 --> 22:00.259
You know, Sergey Stepanovich...

22:01.726 --> 22:03.629
is a very...

22:04.009 --> 22:05.530
complex man.

22:06.035 --> 22:08.000
Can you take this?

22:13.435 --> 22:15.201
Where's Sabinin?

22:15.534 --> 22:18.338
- Went off somewhere, looking gloomy.
- Why?

22:18.654 --> 22:20.818
All this searching.

22:47.614 --> 22:48.948
Well?

22:52.980 --> 22:54.840
Nothing remotely like it.

22:54.988 --> 22:56.528
Strange.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.383
Very strange.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.885
Summer's over...

23:01.339 --> 23:03.783
and we got nowhere.

23:04.313 --> 23:05.943
Strange.

23:10.536 --> 23:13.689
Maybe there are no diamonds in Siberia.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.712
- You got samples from the flood-lands?
- Yes.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.260
And here?

23:23.589 --> 23:25.078
I did.

23:25.471 --> 23:29.158
- And at the source of Nameless Brook?
- Nothing there.

23:31.416 --> 23:33.535
- Strange.
- What's strange?

23:33.635 --> 23:37.204
No expedition ever found anything.
We're not alone.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.358
Next year we'll go somewhere else.

23:40.646 --> 23:42.352
Konstantin Fedorovich.

23:45.066 --> 23:50.552
Don't you think we should
look for the diamond pipe... elsewhere?

23:51.985 --> 23:55.556
You know the geophysicists
found an anomaly here.

23:55.764 --> 23:57.764
- Yes, we know.
- So--

23:57.867 --> 23:59.852
But they could be wrong.

23:59.996 --> 24:03.099
True, but not a consolation.

24:05.801 --> 24:09.919
Maybe the results from
the old searches were pure chance.

24:14.485 --> 24:18.778
If science, intellect and instinct

24:18.862 --> 24:22.054
are nothing but chance,

24:22.328 --> 24:24.641
what are we doing here?

24:26.493 --> 24:28.386
The pipe is somewhere near.

24:28.526 --> 24:32.049
"Somewhere near", "somewhere near",
how many times I heard this.

24:32.189 --> 24:34.383
You're an obsessed man.

24:39.435 --> 24:43.661
How else can you do
anything in this short life?

24:44.023 --> 24:45.266
Wait.

24:50.088 --> 24:51.408
So, what?

24:51.934 --> 24:53.835
We're calling for the plane?

24:53.984 --> 24:55.736
Going back?

24:57.032 --> 24:58.798
Why no answer?

26:13.533 --> 26:14.908
<i>Vera,</i>

26:15.787 --> 26:17.414
<i>my love.</i>

26:19.880 --> 26:21.720
<i>Autumn is here.</i>

26:24.266 --> 26:27.136
<i>We're straining all our might</i>

26:27.379 --> 26:32.852
<i>to wrench out the secret
hidden in this earth.</i>

26:34.868 --> 26:39.800
<i>We are resolutely on the offensive.</i>

28:34.033 --> 28:36.383
<i>So that's it.</i>

28:39.273 --> 28:42.690
<i>They won't send me here a fourth time.</i>

28:42.799 --> 28:44.826
<i>Nobody.</i>

28:47.126 --> 28:49.045
<i>Ever again.</i>

28:51.157 --> 28:54.369
<i>Now it will be quiet here for a long time.</i>

28:54.879 --> 28:56.557
<i>Five years?</i>

28:57.559 --> 28:58.823
<i>Ten?</i>

29:00.548 --> 29:02.321
<i>A hundred?</i>

29:04.654 --> 29:06.507
<i>A thousand?</i>

29:09.274 --> 29:11.585
<i>I am just unlucky.</i>

29:13.756 --> 29:15.687
<i>And I wore out the others.</i>

29:15.862 --> 29:18.346
<i>Maybe Sergey is right...</i>

29:19.559 --> 29:21.705
<i>and there's nothing here.</i>

29:26.510 --> 29:28.015
<i>No!</i>

29:28.644 --> 29:31.376
<i>It's proved in theory.</i>

29:32.078 --> 29:34.363
<i>And I feel it.</i>

29:34.516 --> 29:37.156
<i>Instinct doesn't lie.</i>

29:37.670 --> 29:40.077
<i>Why doesn't it?</i>

29:40.399 --> 29:43.062
<i>It does, very often.</i>

29:44.178 --> 29:46.358
<i>Or maybe never?</i>

29:46.564 --> 29:48.470
<i>What's instinct?</i>

29:48.871 --> 29:52.225
<i>It means "feeling, but not knowing".</i>

29:52.739 --> 29:55.507
<i>But I both know and feel.</i>

32:13.246 --> 32:15.399
Sergey Stepanovich.

32:16.946 --> 32:18.884
You're tired.

33:35.409 --> 33:37.775
Tanya, darling, what is it?

33:38.610 --> 33:41.190
Andrey, look.

33:41.273 --> 33:44.221
- What's happened?
- Look.

33:46.992 --> 33:48.546
Look.

33:54.303 --> 33:57.623
- Well?
- Wait.

34:05.532 --> 34:07.265
Andrey!

34:08.380 --> 34:10.693
Hurray!

34:11.780 --> 34:14.244
We found them!

34:15.220 --> 34:17.220
Hurray!

35:39.256 --> 35:43.295
The great and courageous
discoverers of Siberian diamonds.

35:44.135 --> 35:46.985
Before an obelisk
is erected in our honor

35:47.093 --> 35:49.988
- of Ural gems...
- In Starokonyushenny, in Moscow.

35:50.071 --> 35:53.190
- In Kalinin Street!
- No, Moscow Avenue in Leningrad.

35:53.278 --> 35:56.857
In Sverdlovsk,
by the Ural Restaurant.

35:57.487 --> 36:00.328
And it will say in gold letters,

36:00.428 --> 36:03.794
"To those who delivered Fatherland
from foreign diamond dependence.

36:03.935 --> 36:08.870
"Without them, modern industry would
have been impossible, and space flights...

36:09.038 --> 36:11.525
"would have been postponed
to the next century."

36:11.621 --> 36:14.418
Hurray!

36:15.408 --> 36:16.953
My dears,

36:17.163 --> 36:20.106
I want to drink our precious brandy...

36:20.827 --> 36:23.806
Nice to hear some sober words.

36:24.399 --> 36:26.356
To our return.

36:27.500 --> 36:30.792
- To our return.
- To our return.

36:50.363 --> 36:52.396
Andrey, let's get Moscow.

37:41.464 --> 37:43.597
Everything ready!

37:46.651 --> 37:51.248
Spot markers in place,
the pipe map done, I think.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.669
A city will be here. Diamond City.

37:55.786 --> 37:57.001
Here.

37:57.364 --> 37:58.493
Yes.

37:58.589 --> 38:00.260
Terrific.

38:06.630 --> 38:08.536
Konstantin Fedorovich.

38:08.810 --> 38:11.103
You're sitting by the fire

38:11.264 --> 38:14.677
and for the first time
not writing to your wife. Amazing.

38:14.779 --> 38:16.057
Yes.

38:16.203 --> 38:18.701
Now I will myself give her a letter

38:18.813 --> 38:22.036
of almost a thousand pages.

38:24.989 --> 38:28.500
We are led by good fortune.

38:29.790 --> 38:32.112
Does it mean that
you, Andrey and I

38:32.285 --> 38:35.580
- have not lived in vain already?
- Certainly.

38:35.778 --> 38:39.095
Good for us!

38:46.946 --> 38:51.117
Good, good, good for us.

38:59.561 --> 39:02.044
I am grateful to you.

39:02.806 --> 39:04.328
For what?

39:05.244 --> 39:06.839
The feelings.

39:07.355 --> 39:09.712
Even if unreciprocated.

39:14.225 --> 39:17.298
Tomorrow at dawn, to the boats.

39:20.583 --> 39:22.641
Then the plane.

39:26.584 --> 39:28.158
Farewell.

39:43.227 --> 39:45.500
<i>Vera, Vera.</i>

39:46.310 --> 39:50.809
<i>What a terrible disaster.</i>

39:51.856 --> 39:54.347
<i>The nature is against us.</i>

40:00.518 --> 40:02.298
Get your things, hurry!

40:03.745 --> 40:05.886
- Get this in the boat!
- Mind the radio!

40:05.969 --> 40:07.376
The instruments!

40:08.370 --> 40:09.626
To the boats!

40:09.708 --> 40:13.120
- We have supplies there.
- And the samples.

40:13.322 --> 40:15.020
I'll catch up.

40:20.862 --> 40:24.455
Damn. The supply boat has
been carried away. Come!

40:33.171 --> 40:35.038
My foot!

41:03.463 --> 41:04.889
We can't go there!

41:04.972 --> 41:07.699
We'll starve,
and lose the samples.

41:50.970 --> 41:53.037
Come back!

41:53.419 --> 41:56.371
Sergey Stepanovich, turn back!

41:59.019 --> 42:03.550
I've got it, I've got the boat!

42:04.057 --> 42:06.150
Grab the stuff!

42:09.643 --> 42:11.788
Get out of the fire!

42:11.961 --> 42:14.058
Grab the stuff!

42:14.259 --> 42:16.760
Tanya, this is for you!

42:44.189 --> 42:45.910
Sergey!

43:24.137 --> 43:26.513
We have to get out of the fire.

43:28.814 --> 43:31.011
How stupid, a falling tree...

43:31.115 --> 43:33.435
- Stop it.
- I can't believe it.

43:33.517 --> 43:35.162
Stop it!

43:39.658 --> 43:41.307
Let's go.

43:56.545 --> 43:59.465
- Where are we?
- Keep cool.

44:03.241 --> 44:05.941
We have to report Sergey's death.

44:06.106 --> 44:08.167
Andrey. Get the base.

44:10.273 --> 44:12.204
- The base.
- I'm getting it.

44:16.459 --> 44:18.997
Fatherland, Fatherland.

44:19.423 --> 44:21.510
Octahedron here.

44:21.776 --> 44:25.951
Why are you silent? Over.

44:27.148 --> 44:30.027
- What's the matter with them?
- Are they deaf?

44:31.181 --> 44:33.373
Get the Petrov party.

44:35.582 --> 44:36.748
Yenisei,

44:38.962 --> 44:40.392
this is Octahedron.

44:40.479 --> 44:42.819
Calling the Petrov party, over.

44:42.991 --> 44:45.059
Why are they not answering?

44:51.803 --> 44:53.230
Andrey.

44:53.395 --> 44:54.756
What is this?

44:54.855 --> 44:57.076
- Moscow?
- Irkutsk.

45:00.859 --> 45:02.477
Turn it off.

45:04.382 --> 45:06.435
They should be calling us
in an hour.

45:06.545 --> 45:08.182
Come, Tanya.

45:18.827 --> 45:23.174
Fatherland, Octahedron calling.

45:24.187 --> 45:26.170
This is base.

45:26.337 --> 45:32.360
<i>Your news of the Soviet diamonds discovery
was sent to Moscow.</i>

45:32.480 --> 45:34.745
Thank God, they've woken up.

45:34.999 --> 45:36.833
This is Octahedron.

45:37.585 --> 45:42.280
Receiving you loud and clear.
Are you receiving? Over.

45:43.207 --> 45:48.009
<i>We congratulate you with all our hearts.</i>

45:48.349 --> 45:52.932
<i>You have raised yet higher
the glorious banner of the Soviet geologists.</i>

45:54.759 --> 45:58.708
- They'll hear us.
- This is Octahedron.

45:59.008 --> 46:00.562
Receiving you
loud and clear.

46:00.669 --> 46:03.841
Listen carefully.

46:05.716 --> 46:09.862
- Making a forced detour around fire area.
- Tell them not to worry.

46:10.075 --> 46:11.817
Over to you.

46:12.350 --> 46:14.313
<i>And with you, we rejoice...</i>

46:14.407 --> 46:19.733
- They're not receiving.
<i>- ...at this extremely important discovery.</i>

46:20.805 --> 46:24.864
<i>We realize what pride and joy...</i>

46:25.024 --> 46:27.377
- What's with the radio?
- I think it's working.

46:27.544 --> 46:30.638
- Why don't they receive?
- I don't get it.

46:31.044 --> 46:35.321
<i>We await your return impatiently.</i>

46:35.449 --> 46:39.138
<i>Each of us wants to embrace the lucky team.</i>

46:39.635 --> 46:40.891
Damn.

46:40.974 --> 46:45.972
<i>The geologists are even now
getting ready to welcome you back.</i>

47:00.245 --> 47:04.347
Fatherland, this is Octahedron.

47:05.087 --> 47:07.786
Saving the scientific samples
from forest fire,

47:07.949 --> 47:11.207
Sergey Voronov died heroically. Over.

47:11.720 --> 47:15.570
<i>Dear friends â€“
Konstantin, Sergei, Tanya, Andrei.</i>

47:16.110 --> 47:20.344
<i>A telegram of congratulations
has just been received from Moscow.</i>

47:20.610 --> 47:23.379
- They are not receiving.
- I tell you, it's the radio.

47:23.468 --> 47:27.553
Cancel the reception,
try to raise them from here.

47:28.158 --> 47:33.623
This is Octahedron.
The pipe map is with us.

47:34.009 --> 47:37.114
We shall take it out
of the fire area. Over.

47:37.416 --> 47:40.953
<i>- Octahedron, why are you not responding?</i>
- Nothing...

47:41.036 --> 47:44.415
<i>- We received a telegram...</i>
- The radio's busted.

47:44.892 --> 47:46.290
Get back!

47:47.039 --> 47:49.311
We have to get to the big river.

47:49.627 --> 47:52.708
- And raft downstream.
- Right.

47:53.319 --> 47:57.258
Never mind. We've been
in tough scrapes before.

48:03.278 --> 48:06.570
I think the diamond field we've found

48:07.170 --> 48:10.570
is not the only one in Siberia.

48:11.714 --> 48:13.812
Why don't we...

48:14.073 --> 48:17.403
come back next year?

48:17.914 --> 48:20.900
And search northwards...

48:21.272 --> 48:23.677
even eastwards...

48:26.829 --> 48:31.938
<i>This is Fatherland, calling Octahedron.</i>

48:32.883 --> 48:35.913
<i>We couldn't raise you for several days.</i>

48:36.111 --> 48:38.656
<i>We assume your radio is faulty.</i>

48:38.936 --> 48:40.331
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

48:40.440 --> 48:45.895
<i>Search parties are looking for you.</i>

48:46.174 --> 48:48.896
<i>We will call you every 6 hours.</i>

48:49.102 --> 48:53.630
We'll make war on you yet,
Mother Nature.

48:53.778 --> 48:56.605
<i>Search parties are looking for you.</i>

48:56.708 --> 49:00.633
<i>We will call you every 6 hours.</i>

49:06.176 --> 49:09.390
<i>To all search parties.</i>

49:10.158 --> 49:15.235
<i>The Sabinin party is in distress.</i>

49:15.448 --> 49:17.891
<i>They couldn't be raised
on radio for several days.</i>

49:18.066 --> 49:23.163
<i>As soon as they are spotted,
report to base immediately.</i>

49:23.656 --> 49:25.933
<i>Octahedron,</i>

49:26.520 --> 49:31.966
<i>special planes and helicopters
have been dispatched to look for you.</i>

49:32.913 --> 49:36.464
<i>Try to reach landing base #3.</i>

49:36.997 --> 49:39.732
<i>Sergey Stepanovich.</i>

49:40.339 --> 49:43.108
<i>You know the spot,
and can lead the party to it.</i>

49:43.329 --> 49:46.702
<i>We'll try raising you every 3 hours.</i>

50:09.608 --> 50:11.068
Tanya.

50:14.744 --> 50:17.440
When we're back in Moscow,

50:17.862 --> 50:20.360
no one will believe this.

50:21.901 --> 50:23.020
Yes.

51:02.153 --> 51:03.406
Quiet!

51:19.792 --> 51:21.319
A plane!

51:23.461 --> 51:24.926
A helicopter!

51:31.367 --> 51:34.674
We're saved!
They found us!

51:37.377 --> 51:39.604
We're here!

52:28.886 --> 52:31.379
Where are you going!

52:31.473 --> 52:33.999
We're here!

52:35.866 --> 52:39.030
Come back!

53:05.379 --> 53:09.899
They'll never find us in this smoke.

53:15.420 --> 53:17.158
Andrey.

53:18.677 --> 53:22.183
Come on up. It's alright.

53:23.388 --> 53:25.386
- We're dumping the radio.
- Never.

53:25.495 --> 53:27.509
We can't transmit.

53:28.137 --> 53:30.681
We'll carry only the essentials.

53:31.033 --> 53:32.676
Well, let's go.

53:34.477 --> 53:35.750
I'll manage.

53:39.302 --> 53:42.255
<i>Comrade Sabinin.</i>

53:43.729 --> 53:48.793
<i>To the northwest of the river Khatenakh,
forest fires are raging.</i>

53:49.213 --> 53:54.222
<i>The fire front is close to 1,000km.</i>

53:56.081 --> 54:00.625
<i>We assume that you have gone off course.</i>

54:00.967 --> 54:04.166
<i>The search area has been widened.</i>

54:04.639 --> 54:07.701
<i>Planes have been sent from Yakutsk,</i>

54:08.341 --> 54:12.624
<i>Kirinsk, Novosibirsk and Irkutsk.</i>

54:13.282 --> 54:16.520
<i>The land parties have been strengthened.</i>

54:16.907 --> 54:21.032
<i>All radio stations
are looking for your signal.</i>

54:21.619 --> 54:23.054
<i>I repeat:</i>

54:23.203 --> 54:27.364
<i>all radio stations
are looking for your signal.</i>

54:29.070 --> 54:32.902
<i>And we are positive
that you will soon be spotted.</i>

54:33.209 --> 54:35.950
<i>Courage, dear comrades.</i>

54:37.097 --> 54:40.729
<i>We will call you every 2 hours.</i>

55:29.337 --> 55:30.903
Comrades.

56:45.274 --> 56:47.080
Lean on me.

57:15.131 --> 57:16.618
<i>Vera,</i>

57:17.498 --> 57:19.232
<i>my love.</i>

57:20.533 --> 57:23.950
<i>We keep walking and walking.</i>

57:25.528 --> 57:28.454
<i>I can write no longer.</i>

57:36.340 --> 57:40.767
<i>Andrey is getting weaker every day.</i>

57:42.978 --> 57:45.485
<i>What is he thinking of?</i>

57:46.548 --> 57:48.472
<i>I don't know.</i>

57:52.312 --> 57:56.105
<i>It probably torments him
that we have to carry him.</i>

57:57.217 --> 58:02.148
<i>But I know
this is harder for him than for us.</i>

59:28.012 --> 59:30.386
Is it too heavy, Tanya?

59:31.064 --> 59:32.980
I... just...

59:33.250 --> 59:35.156
stumbled.

59:47.711 --> 59:49.168
Tanya.

59:50.508 --> 59:52.516
Konstantin Fedorovich.

59:55.197 --> 59:58.639
It's a matter of simple arithmetics.

59:59.163 --> 1:00:01.189
Leave me.

1:00:02.169 --> 1:00:03.858
Please, I beg you.

1:00:03.984 --> 1:00:06.245
Cut it out.
What kind of talk is that?

1:00:06.393 --> 1:00:07.859
Andrey.

1:00:08.192 --> 1:00:10.445
I don't recognize you.

1:00:12.739 --> 1:00:14.459
Talking nonsense.

1:00:18.169 --> 1:00:20.209
Lie down. Go on.

1:01:25.809 --> 1:01:27.682
Konstantin Fedorovich.

1:01:32.452 --> 1:01:35.378
- What is it, Andrey?
- Can you see, there...

1:01:35.639 --> 1:01:37.258
a flower?

1:01:38.941 --> 1:01:41.530
Pick it for me, please.

1:01:42.017 --> 1:01:43.554
Please.

1:01:53.787 --> 1:01:55.227
Tanya.

1:01:59.671 --> 1:02:02.194
Today is your birthday.

1:02:04.229 --> 1:02:07.550
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

1:02:13.592 --> 1:02:15.451
Konstantin Fedorovich.

1:02:18.368 --> 1:02:19.704
You know,

1:02:20.744 --> 1:02:22.981
I love Tanya very much.

1:02:24.802 --> 1:02:27.622
We met in college.

1:02:28.906 --> 1:02:31.096
She was wearing...

1:02:32.218 --> 1:02:34.596
a light blue dress...

1:02:36.007 --> 1:02:38.224
with short sleeves.

1:02:38.378 --> 1:02:40.018
Remember?

1:02:42.426 --> 1:02:43.951
And...

1:02:44.940 --> 1:02:47.272
the moment I saw her,

1:02:47.823 --> 1:02:49.678
right away...

1:02:53.088 --> 1:02:55.352
for the rest of my life...

1:02:58.351 --> 1:03:00.786
For the rest of my life.

1:03:04.958 --> 1:03:07.090
Tanya fills...

1:03:07.972 --> 1:03:09.885
my life.

1:03:12.672 --> 1:03:13.898
She...

1:03:15.825 --> 1:03:18.027
she is joy.

1:03:20.106 --> 1:03:22.416
How grateful I am to you,

1:03:23.368 --> 1:03:24.871
my love...

1:03:25.725 --> 1:03:27.298
my love...

1:03:51.325 --> 1:03:53.265
He's tired.

1:03:54.539 --> 1:03:56.123
Asleep.

1:04:04.737 --> 1:04:07.030
I beg you, save him!

1:04:07.277 --> 1:04:09.930
Save him, Konstantin Fedorovich.

1:04:10.217 --> 1:04:14.248
You must, somehow,
by a miracle, save him.

1:04:14.417 --> 1:04:16.135
You must.

1:04:20.110 --> 1:04:23.303
You... blame me, Tanya?

1:04:28.295 --> 1:04:29.795
What?

1:04:32.096 --> 1:04:34.253
How can I?

1:04:35.952 --> 1:04:39.277
It's not for yourself that you stayed here.

1:04:57.717 --> 1:04:59.577
Go to sleep, too.

1:05:48.895 --> 1:05:51.055
"I must do this.

1:05:51.158 --> 1:05:55.838
"It's simple arithmetics.
Better if one dies than three.

1:05:55.920 --> 1:06:00.106
"Don't look for me,
don't waste your strength. Andrey.

1:06:01.359 --> 1:06:04.340
"And still we found the diamonds. Hurray."

1:06:15.283 --> 1:06:16.843
He's up.

1:07:52.537 --> 1:07:55.330
Andrey!

1:08:23.874 --> 1:08:26.182
Where are you?!

1:08:40.556 --> 1:08:45.237
Why aren't you answering?!
Answer me!

1:08:45.369 --> 1:08:47.547
You have no right!

1:08:47.630 --> 1:08:49.855
Andrey!

1:08:50.605 --> 1:08:53.335
Where are you?!

1:09:09.548 --> 1:09:13.961
Answer! You have no right!

1:09:23.050 --> 1:09:25.050
Why are you silent?

1:09:25.776 --> 1:09:27.963
It's wrong!

1:09:28.970 --> 1:09:30.970
I beg you!

1:09:31.380 --> 1:09:34.420
Come back!
Andrey!

1:09:37.412 --> 1:09:41.340
We'll carry you to the river,
it's no weight at all!

1:09:44.670 --> 1:09:48.050
You mustn't, you have no right!

1:09:48.340 --> 1:09:50.635
I love you!

1:09:50.749 --> 1:09:55.544
I love you! I love you!

1:09:55.690 --> 1:09:58.811
You're wrong!

1:10:00.327 --> 1:10:03.240
Andrey!

1:12:04.855 --> 1:12:06.405
A plane!

1:12:07.379 --> 1:12:08.692
A plane!

1:12:08.834 --> 1:12:10.651
Fire, quick!

1:12:53.177 --> 1:12:55.304
What have you done?!

1:12:56.579 --> 1:12:58.684
The last one...

1:14:44.268 --> 1:14:47.793
Sleep, Tanya.

1:14:48.405 --> 1:14:50.261
Sleep.

1:14:53.935 --> 1:14:56.250
Why aren't you sleeping?

1:14:56.746 --> 1:14:58.550
I'm thinking.

1:15:01.249 --> 1:15:02.662
Don't.

1:15:04.029 --> 1:15:06.021
Thoughts tire you out.

1:15:06.223 --> 1:15:08.713
A living man...

1:15:09.128 --> 1:15:11.853
cannot help thinking.

1:15:12.652 --> 1:15:15.438
And not all thoughts are tiring.

1:15:15.750 --> 1:15:19.920
Some gave strength to people
at the time of the worst ordeal.

1:15:22.967 --> 1:15:25.670
I am thinking of Andrey.

1:15:28.501 --> 1:15:30.905
- Andrey?
- Yes.

1:15:32.354 --> 1:15:33.822
He was wrong?

1:15:33.982 --> 1:15:36.671
It's not for us to judge him.

1:15:37.044 --> 1:15:39.745
Be that as it may,
he acted heroically,

1:15:39.903 --> 1:15:42.735
and made it our duty to save the map.

1:15:42.904 --> 1:15:44.354
We will.

1:15:45.306 --> 1:15:47.983
We certainly will.

1:15:53.034 --> 1:15:55.069
In the future,

1:15:55.749 --> 1:15:59.284
you'll often have to keep your oaths.

1:15:59.624 --> 1:16:01.451
Oaths?

1:16:01.921 --> 1:16:06.566
Didn't you take a pioneer's oath as a child?

1:16:08.029 --> 1:16:12.736
All was so solemn and important.

1:16:16.605 --> 1:16:18.220
"I...

1:16:21.955 --> 1:16:24.079
"a young pioneer...

1:16:24.608 --> 1:16:26.919
"of the Soviet Union...

1:16:29.009 --> 1:16:30.486
"in front...

1:16:31.079 --> 1:16:33.035
of my comrades...

1:16:35.402 --> 1:16:39.260
"do solemnly swear..."

1:16:49.391 --> 1:16:52.101
Sometimes, a man has no occasion

1:16:52.384 --> 1:16:56.767
to remember the words
in the whole of his life.

1:16:58.390 --> 1:17:01.172
There's just no call for it.

1:17:03.125 --> 1:17:05.320
But sometimes...

1:17:07.613 --> 1:17:09.045
Tanya...

1:17:10.563 --> 1:17:12.182
We have...

1:17:12.772 --> 1:17:14.302
no food...

1:17:15.315 --> 1:17:17.392
and we're dead tired.

1:17:18.593 --> 1:17:21.002
But we must say...

1:17:21.272 --> 1:17:22.737
no...

1:17:23.443 --> 1:17:25.243
to weakness.

1:17:26.522 --> 1:17:28.928
No to faintheartedness.

1:17:29.370 --> 1:17:31.881
No... to despair.

1:17:34.413 --> 1:17:37.790
And yes to our boundless faith. Yes!

1:17:38.116 --> 1:17:39.413
Yes!

1:17:40.614 --> 1:17:42.067
Yes!

1:17:42.328 --> 1:17:44.080
Yes!

1:17:48.036 --> 1:17:49.410
Yes.

1:17:52.905 --> 1:17:55.396
There, now sleep.

1:17:56.510 --> 1:17:58.375
And dream...

1:17:58.924 --> 1:18:01.157
of a wide river...

1:18:02.984 --> 1:18:04.444
a raft...

1:18:05.539 --> 1:18:07.070
and us...

1:18:07.943 --> 1:18:11.112
rushing to where people are.
Sleep.

1:18:50.150 --> 1:18:51.990
Winter.

1:18:53.175 --> 1:18:54.970
Never mind.

1:18:56.882 --> 1:18:59.828
The Siberian rivers are fast.

1:19:00.495 --> 1:19:03.057
They don't freeze easily.

1:19:05.594 --> 1:19:06.908
Yes.

1:19:07.600 --> 1:19:09.281
Let's go, Tanya.

1:20:27.064 --> 1:20:28.791
Tanya.

1:20:31.952 --> 1:20:34.114
Why don't you answer?

1:21:45.886 --> 1:21:47.874
Tanya!

1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:42.987
The river!

1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:35.789
<i>Vera,</i>

1:26:36.653 --> 1:26:38.568
<i>my beloved Vera.</i>

1:26:39.669 --> 1:26:42.936
<i>My life does not belong to me.</i>

1:26:44.063 --> 1:26:47.451
<i>I must save the map.</i>

1:26:48.366 --> 1:26:50.242
<i>I cannot die.</i>

1:26:51.395 --> 1:26:53.144
<i>I must live,</i>

1:26:53.791 --> 1:26:56.299
<i>for too much...</i>

1:26:56.874 --> 1:27:00.262
<i>has been... lost.</i>

1:27:01.712 --> 1:27:05.339
<i>Too much has been found.</i>

1:28:44.241 --> 1:28:46.614
Hey, people!

1:28:50.460 --> 1:28:53.723
Comrades, look here!

1:29:03.050 --> 1:29:05.357
Take the map!

1:29:45.222 --> 1:29:49.769
Stop me, or I'll float to the ocean.

1:30:01.218 --> 1:30:03.053
Why can't they hear me?

1:30:03.154 --> 1:30:07.232
You cry in a whisper,
you have no strength to cry.

1:30:08.425 --> 1:30:10.144
I must give them the map.

1:30:11.291 --> 1:30:13.960
Keep calm.

1:30:19.203 --> 1:30:22.650
It's only you who sees them.
They're not here.

1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:26.866
They'll come when they find your map.

1:30:27.217 --> 1:30:29.814
They'll build Diamond City.

1:30:30.620 --> 1:30:32.642
All will be like you dreamed of:

1:30:32.776 --> 1:30:36.663
Andrey, Tanya, Sergey.

1:35:49.866 --> 1:35:54.639
THE END
