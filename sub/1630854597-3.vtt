<i>It's the ultimate cooking competition</i>

01:06.800 --> 01:08.902

<i>This is </i>Cook at all Costs.

01:11.638 --> 01:14.207
What's up, home cooks? You ready?

01:14.274 --> 01:16.309
Yeah! I'm ready.

01:16.376 --> 01:18.845
Justin, Tiff, Leanna,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.980
welcome to <i>Cook At All Costs.</i>

01:21.047 --> 01:22.649
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

01:22.715 --> 01:24.184
-Whoo-whoo!

01:25.885 --> 01:27.854
Home cooks, the good news is

01:27.921 --> 01:29.689
we have ingredient boxes
for you to cook with.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.091
Okay.

01:31.157 --> 01:32.459
Now, the bad news is

01:32.525 --> 01:35.395
you just have to outbid
your fellow home cooks to buy them,

01:36.496 --> 01:39.199
using your bank of $25,000.

01:39.265 --> 01:42.168
-All right!
-Oh!

01:42.235 --> 01:45.138
All of your cooking needs
will be coming to you down the line.

01:45.638 --> 01:48.108
And it leads to our guest chef and judge.

01:48.174 --> 01:50.376
She's the owner of Melba's in Harlem

01:50.443 --> 01:53.980
and the soon-to-open
Melba's 550 in Newark,

01:54.047 --> 01:57.350
specializing in Southern classics
and comfort food,

01:57.417 --> 01:58.651
Chef Melba Wilson.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.590
I am so honored to cook for Chef Wilson,

02:03.656 --> 02:05.692
but I'm also incredibly terrified.

02:05.758 --> 02:08.294
Like, she is the queen
of Southern cooking.

02:08.361 --> 02:12.432
Chef Wilson is preparing
three ingredient boxes just for you.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.200
All right, Chef, fire it up!

02:18.037 --> 02:19.072
Oh my gosh.

02:22.876 --> 02:23.743
Okay.

02:25.545 --> 02:29.115
You'll start by secretly bidding
on these three ingredient boxes

02:29.182 --> 02:31.851
using your bank of $25,000.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.554
The highest bidder gets a Spend Box,

02:34.621 --> 02:36.589
which has premium ingredients

02:36.656 --> 02:38.358
to help you plate a premium dish.

02:38.424 --> 02:39.425
Okay.

02:39.492 --> 02:43.363
Lowest bidder gets the Save Box,
which is made up of simple ingredients

02:43.429 --> 02:47.800
that require your skills
to transform them into winning dishes.

02:47.867 --> 02:51.104
And the remaining cook
will get the Surprise Box,

02:51.171 --> 02:54.774
which is made up of unique ingredients
that'll really keep you on your toes.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.942
I don't know about that.

02:56.543 --> 02:59.112
Remember, only one of you
will win the competition

02:59.179 --> 03:01.881
and walk away
with whatever is left in your bank.

03:02.582 --> 03:06.386
Home cooks, we'll start
with a minimum bid of $2,500

03:06.452 --> 03:08.288
and you can lock in your bids now.

03:10.723 --> 03:13.159
I work in corporate finance,
what that means is I work

03:13.226 --> 03:14.761
looking at investments all day long.

03:14.827 --> 03:18.731
I want that Spend Box.
Anything in there has to be amazing.

03:19.332 --> 03:22.569
I came to play and playing small
never gets you to the finish line.

03:22.635 --> 03:23.636
I want the Spend Box,

03:23.703 --> 03:26.072
because that's gotta be
where the premium ingredients are.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.007
You want the best stuff if you wanna win.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.877
Tiff, let's take a look at your bid.

03:31.377 --> 03:33.780
$3,002.

03:33.846 --> 03:39.152
Justin, you put in a bid of $4,251.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.187
Man's got some money to spend.

03:41.854 --> 03:45.892
And Leanna, let's take a look
at your bid. $3,700.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.494
That means Justin, you had the highest bid

03:48.561 --> 03:50.063
and you get the Spend Box.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.799
-Did Justin just make it rain?
-He did. I saw that too.

03:52.865 --> 03:53.833
Wow.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.638
Tiff, you made the lowest bid,
so it means you get the Save Box.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.207
-Good luck.

04:01.274 --> 04:04.410
I'm okay. I can think on my feet.
Let's see what's in that box.

04:04.477 --> 04:07.814
Which leaves Leanna
with a $3,700 surprise.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.449
All right, let's do it.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.218
You have 60 minutes

04:12.285 --> 04:13.786
to make an out-of-the-box dish

04:13.853 --> 04:15.455
in any style you want,

04:15.521 --> 04:18.524
and watch out for more ingredients
coming down the line

04:18.591 --> 04:22.528
that Chef Melba is preparing for you
to have the opportunity to bid on.

04:23.263 --> 04:27.100
Justin, Tiff, Leanna,
are you ready to cook at all costs?

04:27.166 --> 04:28.534
Yes!

04:28.601 --> 04:31.004
Good, 'cause your time starts now!

04:34.307 --> 04:35.775
Of course, mine is at the end.

04:40.546 --> 04:42.048
Butternut squash,

04:42.715 --> 04:43.950
endive,

04:44.017 --> 04:46.152
smoked pork hock. Okay.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.287
This isn't so bad.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.189
I've got butternut squash
and some smoked pork.

04:50.256 --> 04:53.359
Because it's smoked, I now
that it's going to have a lot of flavor.

04:53.426 --> 04:55.228
Certainly, we can do something with that.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.096
Alfredo.

04:57.163 --> 05:00.033
But powdered Alfredo sauce?

05:00.099 --> 05:01.200
"Sauce mix"?

05:01.267 --> 05:03.136
Like, I don't even have milk,

05:03.202 --> 05:04.504
I don't have butter.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.940
You're asking me to make
Alfredo sauce with no dairy. How?

05:09.375 --> 05:10.810
What you got over there, Tiff?

05:10.877 --> 05:13.112
I got pork cutlet, people.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.114
-Oh!
-I can do something with that.

05:15.181 --> 05:17.684
In the Save Box,
I see pork cutlets.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.386
I got some lettuce, butternut squash.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.090
What?! Spaghetti in a can.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.725
Nonna would kill me.

05:26.292 --> 05:29.095
Canned spaghetti! If my Nonna was here,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.597
she'd say…
"What's the matter for you?"

05:31.664 --> 05:33.666
Chef Melba,
what is this?

05:33.733 --> 05:37.704
These are going away.
My canned spaghetti are going away.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.273
What is this?

05:40.340 --> 05:43.443
This Spend Box means I am going
to have the premium ingredients

05:43.509 --> 05:44.877
and make an incredible dish.

05:44.944 --> 05:46.913
Oh, some goat cheese.

05:46.979 --> 05:48.114
I think this is pear.

05:49.082 --> 05:49.982
Pumpkins,

05:50.049 --> 05:51.384
whatever this thing is.

05:51.451 --> 05:52.685
A whole rack of lamb.

05:53.853 --> 05:56.155
All right, all the boxes
have been revealed,

05:56.222 --> 05:57.557
and for our proteins,

05:57.623 --> 06:00.927
Leanna has smoked pork hock
in the Surprise Box,

06:01.494 --> 06:04.130
Tiff has pork cutlets with her Save Box,

06:04.197 --> 06:07.600
and Justin has crown pork roast
in his Spend Box.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.636
It's pork?
I thought this was lamb. It's pork.

06:13.639 --> 06:15.742
You know what?
I don't want to hear nothing out of you.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.878
You got the premium box. I don't want
to hear no complaints out of you, sir.

06:18.945 --> 06:22.915
Now that I know that it's pork,
I'm thinking apple sauce goes with pork

06:22.982 --> 06:26.919
and pear's kind of like an apple,
so I'm making a pan-seared pork

06:26.986 --> 06:29.188
with a goat-cheese-and-squash purée,

06:29.255 --> 06:31.324
along with a pear and pumpkin spice sauce.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.359
This Spend Box, crazy expensive.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.094
But this is so worth every penny.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.263
So at my job in corporate finance,

06:37.330 --> 06:40.233
most of what I do
is very methodical and precise.

06:40.299 --> 06:43.503
In the kitchen, I can really break
all the rules that I want to.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.908
It's interesting.
I've got some good ingredients.

06:48.975 --> 06:52.645
I'm still trying to figure out exactly
how I'm going to use them together.

06:52.712 --> 06:56.215
So I've got butternut squash spirals,
so the first thing I think is

06:56.282 --> 06:58.551
we're going to use this
as a pasta substitute.

06:58.618 --> 07:01.220
And we've got
this weird Alfredo sauce packet,

07:01.287 --> 07:03.823
so I want to do something carbonara-style.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.726
You've got the smoked meat
that's kind of like pancetta,

07:06.793 --> 07:10.763
so I can get that salt, get that fat,
get that different texture.

07:10.830 --> 07:15.334
So I am making a creamy, smoky
butternut squash pasta

07:15.401 --> 07:16.836
and a frisée salad.

07:16.903 --> 07:20.840
I'm going to get some of this fat
from here to build flavor profile

07:20.907 --> 07:23.743
since I don't really have much
in way of the spice.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.245
Primarily, I cook for my son
and my husband.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.381
You know, grilling out in the backyard.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.917
I like to get their reactions,
get their critiques.

07:30.983 --> 07:32.285
Whoo-whoo!

07:32.351 --> 07:35.455
So I am super excited
to cook for Chef Melba.

07:35.521 --> 07:38.558
She is culinary royalty.
There's no other way to say it.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.528
Ah!

07:42.595 --> 07:45.164
-Chef, how are you?
-Yes, I'm amazing.

07:45.231 --> 07:48.701
-Those boxes are intense.
-They're amazing, right?

07:48.768 --> 07:51.037
I love them. What do you think
is the most challenging

07:51.103 --> 07:52.171
of those three boxes?

07:52.238 --> 07:55.475
I actually think the Surprise Box
is really challenging.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.576
-Really?
-You know…

07:56.642 --> 07:59.178
There are ham hocks in there,
as we call them, right?

07:59.245 --> 08:03.216
Being that space
between the foot and the leg,

08:03.282 --> 08:05.284
that connecting kind of knuckle,
so to speak--

08:05.351 --> 08:07.520
-Yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Packs a lot of flavor.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.856
So are they going to know
what to do with it?

08:09.922 --> 08:10.923
What I would do…

08:10.990 --> 08:11.858
Mm-hmm?

08:12.725 --> 08:14.594
-Nobody's listening, right?
-No, no. You're good.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.162
I'd grab that pressure cooker.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.564
-Come on, now. Come on, now!
-That's what I'm talking about!

08:18.631 --> 08:22.969
Extract that flavor, that smokiness
and that yumminess that's in there.

08:23.035 --> 08:26.539
Going now to the Spend Box,
you put a crown pork roast in there.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.407
You're dealing with the best of the best.

08:28.474 --> 08:32.278
I am expecting
an extremely high-quality dish.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.913
You've really to got to deliver on that.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.582
At the end of the day,
you gotta make Mama happy.

08:36.649 --> 08:40.119
Yeah. All right, Chef, send out
those upgrades whenever you're ready.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.787
-All right, you got it.
-See you in a bit.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.324
All right. I'm gonna taste
some of these pecans here. Mmm!

08:46.926 --> 08:48.294
Let's get this going.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.629
-Whoa!

08:49.695 --> 08:52.298
I'm putting this canned spaghetti
behind me

08:52.365 --> 08:53.966
because today it's about elevation,

08:54.033 --> 08:56.736
so I'm using eggs and flour
from the basic pantry

08:56.802 --> 08:59.472
because I'm 100%
going to make my own pasta.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.974
Oh, my gosh.
You broke out the pasta maker!

09:02.041 --> 09:04.944
-Oh, she's doing it, she's doing it!

09:05.011 --> 09:06.712
Butternut squash is in the oven.

09:06.779 --> 09:08.414
I'm going to do a ravioli.

09:08.481 --> 09:12.251
I'm making a butternut squash ravioli
with a pork cutlet.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.053
Being Italian, I love food.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.657
I love learning from my family
on how to cook traditional dishes.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.993
-There we go, there we go.
-Oh, you going for it, girl.

09:21.961 --> 09:27.366
It takes some serious gumption
to go and make homemade pasta.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.501
Perfect!

09:28.568 --> 09:31.137
If she pulls that off,
she deserves to win.

09:31.671 --> 09:34.106
I'd love some basil right now, you know?

09:34.173 --> 09:35.308
Basil would be good.

09:35.374 --> 09:39.579
I don't have any herbs.
I need some sort of flavor for this dish.

09:44.483 --> 09:46.152
Y'all, we got something coming!

09:46.218 --> 09:48.087
-Something's coming!
-Something's coming!

09:50.256 --> 09:53.559
-Auction time! Let's spend some money!
-Whoo-whoo!

09:53.626 --> 09:56.596
What do we got? What do we got? Show us!

09:56.662 --> 09:58.764
The first item up for bid is…

09:59.432 --> 10:01.767
Ooh, some fresh sage.

10:01.834 --> 10:05.504
The umami of the herb world
works so well with pork.

10:05.571 --> 10:09.175
I want the sage
for my Alfredo butternut squash pasta.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.344
I have no herbs.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.346
I'll start the bidding here at $600.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.581
-Do I have $600? Do I have 700?

10:15.648 --> 10:17.316
-700, 700.
-$700 to Tiff.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.485
-Do I have 800? $800?
-800.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.454
-Do I have $900?
-900.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.122
900 to Tiff. Do I have 1,000?

10:23.189 --> 10:24.190
-$1,000?

10:24.256 --> 10:25.424
Do I have $1,200?

10:25.491 --> 10:26.559
-1,200.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.029
1,200. 1,200 going once,
1,200 going twice…

10:30.096 --> 10:32.865
-Sold to Tiff.
-Whoo!

10:32.932 --> 10:35.234
This sage might be the key to my dish.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.904
I think it's going to be beautiful inside
the ravioli with that butternut squash.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.940
The next item up for auction is…

10:41.841 --> 10:43.075
panko breadcrumbs.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.211
Ooh, I could do some kind of, like,

10:45.277 --> 10:47.880
toasted panko crumb
for additional texture.

10:47.947 --> 10:49.582
I'm gonna start this bidding at $1,000.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.916
-$1,000.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.451
$1,000 going once,

10:52.518 --> 10:54.186
$1,000 going twice.

10:54.253 --> 10:57.790
-Sold for some bread crumbs, AKA panko.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.425
-Well done, well done.
-Thank you.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.762
And the last item up for auction is…

11:03.562 --> 11:05.698
Ooh, lovely, crispy shallots.

11:05.765 --> 11:09.101
Imagine what you can do
with that flavor, that texture.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.670
Great for a garnish.

11:10.736 --> 11:13.506
Crispy shallots would really help.
I really want to use that

11:13.572 --> 11:15.641
as a nice textural element
on top of my pork.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.643
I'm gonna start this off at $700.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.145
-Do I have $800?

11:19.211 --> 11:20.112
-800.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.714
-Do I have $900?

11:21.781 --> 11:23.983
-Do I have 1,000?
-What you making over there?

11:24.050 --> 11:25.885
Don't worry about what I'm making, Justin.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.753
-Focus. Worry about yourself.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.889
-1,100.

11:29.955 --> 11:32.191
-Okay, do I have 1,200? 1,200 to Leanna.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.226
-Justin, why are you playing--
-Do I have 1,300?

11:34.293 --> 11:36.662
-$1,300? Nope. 1,200 going once.
-That's just stupid money.

11:36.729 --> 11:38.130
Going twice.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.799
And sold to Leanna!

11:39.865 --> 11:43.169
-All right. Thank you, thank you.
-Crispy shallots for $1,200.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.905
-Thank you, thank you, thank you.
-Leanna went shopping today.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.473
You know I love to spend some money.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.141
-Apparently!

11:49.208 --> 11:51.143
Can't believe
that I just spent $2,200

11:51.210 --> 11:53.112
on some crispy shallots and panko crumbs,

11:53.179 --> 11:56.716
but it's going down, I'm using them,
and it's going to be great.

11:56.782 --> 11:59.685
So we're going to do
a little bit of the bread crumbs in here.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.455
So I get the panko,
it's going in the salad, that's it.

12:02.521 --> 12:03.789
Then with the shallots,

12:03.856 --> 12:07.593
I'm thinking this is something else
to add to the flavor profile of the pasta,

12:07.660 --> 12:09.962
but it'll also give me
a nice additional crunch.

12:11.697 --> 12:14.033
Okay. Sage, butternut squash.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.635
Now that I have the sage,
I want to mix that

12:16.702 --> 12:19.305
with the butternut squash
and I'm going to stuff that ravioli.

12:19.371 --> 12:22.441
You're all different sizes,
but we're going to fix that.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.277
Making ravioli's a huge risk.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.548
I am really investing
a lot of time to this pasta.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.283
You're gonna be a little smaller. Okay.

12:31.350 --> 12:34.820
But I gotta live with it.
I've started, I have to finish it.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.489
Please stay closed.

12:37.623 --> 12:40.893
-Five minutes left, home cooks.
-Mamma Mia!

12:40.960 --> 12:42.795
-Moving to plating.
-What?

12:42.862 --> 12:44.797
Nobody cooks faster
than a working mama

12:44.864 --> 12:46.732
that got to get dinner
on the table by <i>Jeopardy.</i>

12:49.468 --> 12:51.504
In my squash purée,
I'm adding goat cheese,

12:51.570 --> 12:54.573
and that's going to add
this nice tangy, creamy element to it.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.977
And my pear sauce is going
to add some acidity and sweetness.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.846
Winning this competition
for me is not only about the money.

13:00.913 --> 13:03.382
It's to prove to myself
that I actually am a good cook.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.118
30 seconds left.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.055
Who?! Who's cooking with fire?

13:11.090 --> 13:12.391
Me, I guess.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.661
My dish cost me $4,202 dollars.

13:15.728 --> 13:20.499
This better be the best ravioli
Chef Melba has ever tasted.

13:21.033 --> 13:23.169
You got ten seconds. Ten…

13:23.235 --> 13:26.138
-…nine, eight, seven…

13:26.205 --> 13:29.608
-…six, five, four, three…

13:29.675 --> 13:32.244
-…two, one. Time's up!

13:32.311 --> 13:34.747
-Time's up. Good job, good job.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.048
Oh!

13:38.617 --> 13:39.518
Home cooks,

13:39.585 --> 13:42.955
we're going to send these plates back
for Chef Wilson to sample and judge.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.525
I think the flavors
of my dish are pretty good.

13:46.592 --> 13:48.093
This dish could win,

13:48.160 --> 13:51.630
but it really depends on what…
…my competitors have made.

13:54.767 --> 13:55.935
What up, Chef?

13:56.001 --> 13:58.237
-Oh, my God.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.306
Right on time because I'm hungry.

14:00.372 --> 14:02.408
Okay, Chef, for the first one,

14:02.474 --> 14:04.109
here you have a creamy,

14:04.176 --> 14:06.745
smoky butternut squash pasta

14:06.812 --> 14:08.080
with ham hocks

14:08.147 --> 14:12.117
and a side of frisée salad
topped with panko breadcrumbs.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.887
Mmm! Mmm.

14:15.821 --> 14:20.559
I love the playfulness of using
the butternut squash as a pasta!

14:20.626 --> 14:24.663
And can I tell you, those ham hocks?
I'm getting smoky.

14:24.730 --> 14:27.566
I'm getting delectable.
I'm getting delicious.

14:28.267 --> 14:32.137
I love the way that the home cook
really took the ingredients

14:32.204 --> 14:34.506
in the Surprise Box and incorporated them.

14:34.573 --> 14:37.076
So this home cook purchased
panko bread crumbs

14:37.142 --> 14:38.811
and the crispy shallots.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.147
I am getting the shallots,
however, I'm not getting the panko.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.983
I would not have purchased both.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.619
However, my grandmother
would be right here

14:46.685 --> 14:48.954
sopping this up with a biscuit.

14:49.021 --> 14:49.989
Love that.

14:51.924 --> 14:54.393
-Right, Chef, you're all set. Move on?
-Let's move.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.428
Okay. For this next dish,

14:56.495 --> 14:59.231
this is a butternut squash
and sage ravioli

14:59.298 --> 15:00.733
with a pork cutlet.

15:06.705 --> 15:11.677
Being able to make homemade pasta,
and to make it this beautiful--

15:11.744 --> 15:14.546
-Uh, yeah, that's--
-…it's a feat. Especially for 60 minutes.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.048
-Yeah.
-The ravioli.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.550
-The squash on the inside, lovely.
-Mm-hmm.

15:18.617 --> 15:21.020
However, the ratio was a bit off.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.656
I had to travel to get
to the butternut squash.

15:23.722 --> 15:27.092
-Okay.
-And the pork cutlet lacked seasoning.

15:27.593 --> 15:32.097
This home cook purchased sage for $1,200.

15:32.164 --> 15:34.967
It would have been a good purchase.

15:35.034 --> 15:38.003
However, the sage is not present.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.905
I just wish it had a little more flavor.

15:42.241 --> 15:45.678
All right, Chef. In front of you,
you have a pan-seared pork chop

15:45.744 --> 15:48.714
with a kabocha squash
and goat cheese purée.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.383
And then a pumpkin-spice
pear sauce on the side.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.886
Ooh! The presentation is beautiful.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.324
Looks a little bit overcooked, though.

16:02.027 --> 16:03.629
-Mmm.
-Mmm?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.497
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

16:05.564 --> 16:06.832
Overcooked, definitely.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.001
But well-seasoned.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.269
Okay.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.971
Oh my God, the pear.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.138
Mmm!

16:13.205 --> 16:15.574
Pear always pairs well with a chop, right?

16:15.641 --> 16:16.909
It do-- It really does.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.511
The squash,
cooked really, really well.

16:19.578 --> 16:23.449
Kabocha squash is sort of like a mix
between a potato and a sweet potato,

16:23.515 --> 16:26.752
which is nice, it's almost like having
mashed potatoes and a pork chop, right?

16:26.819 --> 16:29.888
But I'm stuck
with the pork being overcooked.

16:29.955 --> 16:34.426
-On a Spend Box, you got to get it right.
-Yeah.

16:36.295 --> 16:37.896
So, have you come to a decision?

16:37.963 --> 16:42.201
There are so many amazing elements
in each one of these dishes.

16:42.267 --> 16:45.537
However, there is one
that really, really stood out to me.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.644
Home cooks, it's result time.

16:53.145 --> 16:54.980
Okay.

16:55.047 --> 16:57.850
The home cook
with the best out-of-the-box dish is…

17:02.121 --> 17:03.889
-Leanna.
-Oh my gosh!

17:03.956 --> 17:05.624
-All right!

17:06.425 --> 17:09.428
Chef Wilson thought
your use of butternut squash spirals

17:09.495 --> 17:11.430
to be clever and delicious.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.731
Thank you so much!

17:12.798 --> 17:15.534
I won the round! And I am floored.

17:15.601 --> 17:16.969
Holy crap, okay.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.272
I'm the one who's most surprised
by my Surprise Box win.

17:22.341 --> 17:25.444
Now, it's time for your final challenge,
and since we're lucky enough

17:25.511 --> 17:28.747
to have the author
of <i>Melba's American Comfort</i> with us,

17:28.814 --> 17:30.349
the choice was obvious.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.351
-Southern comfort.
-All right.

17:32.418 --> 17:35.888
You'll be working with ingredient boxes
curated by Chef Wilson

17:35.954 --> 17:38.590
to create
your best Southern-inspired dish.

17:39.324 --> 17:42.694
Oh, Chef Wilson,
please send out those ingredient boxes.

17:48.367 --> 17:51.403
Home cooks,
in this round the boxes have set prices.

17:52.371 --> 17:55.574
The Save Box will cost $4,000,

17:55.641 --> 17:58.677
the Spend Box is $8,000,

17:58.744 --> 18:01.480
and the price
of the Surprise Box is $6,000.

18:02.047 --> 18:06.185
Leanna, because you won the first round,
you've earned the power to pick your box.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.458
And assign a box to each
of your fellow home cooks.

18:12.524 --> 18:13.959
-Whoa!

18:14.026 --> 18:15.027
Price tag included.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.528
Oh, man, this is awesome.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.498
We'll make it easy. Let's start with you.
What box do you want to buy?

18:20.165 --> 18:22.034
I'm going for broke. I'm taking the Spend.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.203
Oh, wow! All right, I like that.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.973
I'm picking the Spend Box for myself
because I want to make sure I have

18:28.040 --> 18:29.741
all of the advantages that I can.

18:29.808 --> 18:32.744
Leanna, who would you like
to assign the Save Box to?

18:33.779 --> 18:34.947
To Tiff.

18:35.013 --> 18:36.682
No problemo.

18:36.748 --> 18:40.853
That pasta in round one
showed me that she's coming for it.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.889
I want to make sure
that I kind of tamp that down.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.226
That means, Justin,
you got the Surprise Box,

18:47.292 --> 18:49.261
setting you back $6,000.

18:49.995 --> 18:52.965
In the end, the cook
with the best Southern comfort dish

18:53.031 --> 18:55.634
will win all the cash
remaining in their bank.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.737
There is 45 minutes on the clock

18:59.404 --> 19:00.472
and the time has come

19:00.539 --> 19:02.441
to cook at all costs!

19:09.248 --> 19:11.083
Oh, my goodness.

19:11.150 --> 19:14.286
I have a very methodical approach
to my cooking,

19:14.353 --> 19:16.722
so I do not love surprises.

19:16.788 --> 19:19.158
Condensed milk, cheese.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.592
Condensed milk and fruit?

19:20.659 --> 19:22.394
Leanna, you really did it to me.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.399
Soft-shell crabs. This is…

19:27.466 --> 19:29.401
-This is a surprise.

19:29.468 --> 19:32.037
I have no idea how I'm going
to use these ingredients.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.072
Man, oh, man, oh man.

19:35.073 --> 19:38.443
Okay, pinto beans, evaporated milk.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.780
Oh! Crawfish!

19:41.847 --> 19:44.583
I got the Save Box and I got crawfish?

19:45.284 --> 19:46.285
Hello.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.754
I've never even seen a crawfish.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.455
I think this is collard greens.

19:51.056 --> 19:54.860
I'm Italian, so Southern comfort
is totally out of my element.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.162
Okay, um…

19:57.229 --> 19:59.298
I don't know what I'm doing.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.433
What do you got over there, Leanna?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.302
I got buttermilk, catfish.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.537
I got fried green tomatoes and peaches.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.738
Oh my God!

20:06.805 --> 20:11.610
I've spent $8,000 on the Spend Box,
and it was worth every penny.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.245
Let's do this.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.348
Okay, we have
all our proteins on the table.

20:16.415 --> 20:19.184
Tiff with crawfish from her Save Box,

20:19.251 --> 20:21.853
Justin with his soft-shell crab
from his Surprise Box,

20:21.920 --> 20:24.590
and Leanna with catfish
from her Spend Box.

20:24.656 --> 20:25.657
Get it going.

20:26.925 --> 20:29.194
I have a cornucopia of Southern items,

20:29.261 --> 20:32.864
so I am making fried catfish
with fried green tomatoes.

20:33.498 --> 20:38.136
It is an absolute honor to be cooking
a Southern dish for Chef Melba,

20:38.203 --> 20:41.873
but it's also incredibly intimidating.
This is the queen of Southern food!

20:41.940 --> 20:44.309
Like, you have to come correct.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.912
What up, Chef?

20:47.412 --> 20:48.447
-Now…
-Yes?

20:48.513 --> 20:51.883
Tell me about the origin
of Southern comfort food.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.986
When you're talking
about Southern comfort food,

20:54.052 --> 20:58.257
you're talking about food
with a rich, rich history.

20:58.323 --> 21:00.325
-Back in the days, during slavery--
-Yeah.

21:00.392 --> 21:01.860
-Let's keep it real, okay?
-Yeah.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.161
On the plantation,

21:03.228 --> 21:06.898
the food that the slaves
were given was the worst.

21:06.965 --> 21:09.534
It was the garbage food.
And we had to take that food

21:09.601 --> 21:14.106
and prepare it in a way
so that it was nutritious and delicious.

21:14.172 --> 21:17.542
When I was out there
with the home cooks, I saw catfish,

21:17.609 --> 21:18.877
but in the Spend Box.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.180
Well, because when you're talking
about Southern comfort food--

21:22.247 --> 21:25.284
-Mm-hmm.
-…catfish is our steak.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.053
I noticed, and actually,
I think I smelled,

21:28.120 --> 21:30.122
that you're working
on something delicious.

21:30.188 --> 21:33.358
So there wasn't a time
that my mother had dinner

21:33.425 --> 21:37.396
that she did not enjoy sweet potatoes.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.499
And she would finish them off
with some cinnamon, brown sugar.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.368
-Bye! See you.
-See you soon.

21:45.237 --> 21:48.073
-Leanna, do you have butter?
-No, I-- I don't have butter.

21:48.140 --> 21:52.544
When I hear Southern comfort,
I think biscuits, I think cornbread.

21:52.611 --> 21:55.147
So my dish needs butter.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.982
We're gonna have to make this work.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.885
I don't know how you make
a Southern box with no butter.

22:01.186 --> 22:03.422
With the Surprise Box,
I'm not really sure what to do here.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.590
So I start cutting open these okra

22:05.657 --> 22:08.193
and I'm thinking,
"Oh, these are kind of gummy inside."

22:08.260 --> 22:10.562
"Gummy, gummy…" Gumbo!
That's where I'm heading.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.932
I'm actually going to use some
of these beans as a substitute for rice.

22:13.999 --> 22:17.436
For crunch, I was thinking
of doing tempura on the soft-shell.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.571
Soft-shell crabs,
I know you can eat the shells,

22:19.638 --> 22:21.206
so I'm going to deep-fry them.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.141
It's exotic, it's exciting,

22:23.642 --> 22:26.411
but I need something to flavor my gumbo.

22:26.478 --> 22:28.680
If I don't get anything
in this auction like last time,

22:28.747 --> 22:32.684
my gumbo's just going to taste
like salty soft-shell crab water.

22:35.654 --> 22:38.523
Got to prep these while I'm thinking
about what I'm going to make.

22:38.590 --> 22:41.493
That is step one, I believe.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.329
So the honest truth is
I don't know what I'm gonna make.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.834
I haven't even touched
these ingredients before,

22:49.401 --> 22:51.370
but I got the Save Box,

22:51.436 --> 22:56.074
so I am ready to spend, spend, spend
when those auction ingredients come out.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.510
Go big or go home.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.715
Something's coming, y'all.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.250
Give it to me!

23:08.253 --> 23:11.323
And I'm hoping something under there
is gonna give me some direction.

23:12.257 --> 23:14.860
I see these cloches
coming down the conveyor belt

23:14.926 --> 23:17.295
and all I'm thinking is butter!

23:18.663 --> 23:22.000
-Home cooks, who's up for another auction?
-Yes!

23:22.067 --> 23:25.237
First item is the Holy Trinity.

23:25.303 --> 23:27.472
Celery, onion, and green bell peppers.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.608
The classic Creole combo.

23:30.175 --> 23:32.411
For this gumbo to work,
I need aromatics.

23:32.477 --> 23:35.213
So the Holy Trinity,
this is perfect for my dish.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.848
-Do I have $1,000?
-1,000.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.216
Do I have $1,200?

23:38.283 --> 23:39.718
-$1,200 to Tiff.
-1,200.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.586
-1,400.
-1,400 going to Justin.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.021
-1,600.
-1,600!

23:43.088 --> 23:44.990
-$2,000.
-$2,000.

23:45.056 --> 23:46.758
-Do I have $2,400?
-$2,400!

23:46.825 --> 23:48.059
$2,400!

23:48.126 --> 23:49.828
-2,800.
-$2,800!

23:49.895 --> 23:50.996
-$3,000.

23:51.062 --> 23:51.963
-$3,000.
-Whoo!

23:52.030 --> 23:54.332
-That's 35.
-$3,500 going to Justin!

23:54.399 --> 23:56.268
-Let's go, Justin!
-Justin! Wow!

23:56.334 --> 23:57.436
Do I have $4,000?

23:57.502 --> 24:00.071
-No!
-Going once, $3,500 going twice.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.274
Sold for $3,500 to Justin.

24:02.340 --> 24:03.809
Big money, big money.

24:04.509 --> 24:07.879
I am always on the lookout
for the best investment and this was it.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.482
The next item up for auction is…

24:10.549 --> 24:12.818
buttermilk buns.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.519
-Oh, man.
-Do I have $1,000?

24:14.586 --> 24:16.521
-I'll give you $1,000.

24:16.588 --> 24:18.323
Okay. $1,000 going once,

24:18.390 --> 24:20.625
$1,000 going twice.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.961
-Sold to Tiff.
-Whoo!

24:23.028 --> 24:24.830
Okay, that changes things.

24:24.896 --> 24:27.098
Okay, for this next item up for auction,

24:27.165 --> 24:29.434
this was made personally
by Chef Melba Wilson.

24:29.501 --> 24:30.335
What?!

24:30.402 --> 24:32.337
Roasted sweet potatoes,

24:32.404 --> 24:34.873
and they're here for you at $1,000.

24:34.940 --> 24:37.375
-$1,000, do I have $1,200?

24:37.442 --> 24:38.643
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

24:38.710 --> 24:39.611
Oh, my goodness!

24:39.678 --> 24:40.712
Do I have $1,500?

24:40.779 --> 24:43.248
-$1,500 from Leanna.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.450
-Do I have $1,800? $1,800.
-$1,800.

24:45.517 --> 24:47.786
-All right, I'm out, I'm out.
-$1,800 going once.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.087
Going twice.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.523
-Sold to Tiff.
-Whoo!

24:51.590 --> 24:55.026
Leanna, you thought
you were hurting me with that Save Box,

24:55.093 --> 24:58.897
but I am making it rain
and I'm buying every item I can.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.432
Okay, home cooks,

25:00.499 --> 25:02.934
the next item up for bid,
I'm actually not going to reveal.

25:03.001 --> 25:03.835
What?

25:03.902 --> 25:06.972
It's something that everyone knows
is truly Southern comfort,

25:07.038 --> 25:09.241
and believe me, I'm a chef.
I know what I'm talking about.

25:09.307 --> 25:11.042
I'm gonna start the bid $1,000.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.110
-$1,000.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.712
-Do I have $1,200?
-1,200.

25:13.778 --> 25:15.847
-$1,200 from Justin.
-$1,400.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.449
$1,400 from Tiff. Do I have 16?

25:17.516 --> 25:19.017
-Yeah.
-Oh, 1,600 from Justin.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.118
Do I have $1,800?

25:20.185 --> 25:21.820
-$1,800.
-$1,800 Tiff.

25:21.887 --> 25:22.787
Do I have 2,000?

25:22.854 --> 25:25.991
-You do. 2,000.
-$2,000 going to Justin. Do I have 2,400?

25:26.057 --> 25:27.926
-You do have 2,400.
-2,400 going to Tiff.

25:27.993 --> 25:28.827
-2,800?

25:28.894 --> 25:30.862
-2,800, Leanna! What?

25:30.929 --> 25:34.900
Last minute, I decided to throw my hat
in the ring, because what if it is butter?

25:34.966 --> 25:37.035
-$3,500?
-Yeah.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.404
-$3,500! Let's go, Tiff!

25:39.471 --> 25:41.573
At this point,
I am on a shopping spree.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.476
I am taking, I am picking,
I'm going to use it.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.877
$3,500 going once,

25:45.944 --> 25:49.548
$3,500 going twice, sold!

25:50.048 --> 25:52.250
Tiff, here's what you bought for $3,500.

25:52.884 --> 25:53.985
Butter and grits, baby.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.420
-Oh!
-Baby, baby!

25:55.487 --> 25:58.290
-I told you! I told you it was worth it!

25:58.356 --> 26:00.492
God dang it, it's butter!

26:00.559 --> 26:01.927
I'm so pissed.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.128
She got the butter!

26:03.194 --> 26:04.996
Oh! First time cooking grits.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.798
I'm gonna make this happen.

26:07.365 --> 26:11.102
I just spent $7,800 at this auction.

26:11.169 --> 26:13.104
I need to figure out what I'm going to do.

26:13.171 --> 26:14.339
You got any ideas yet?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.540
And I got these buns.

26:15.607 --> 26:19.711
I see these buttermilk buns
and I think, "I can do crawfish sandwich."

26:19.778 --> 26:23.381
And the beans, I think,
can go with any kind of vegetable.

26:23.448 --> 26:25.483
And the collard greens are pretty soft.

26:25.550 --> 26:28.086
I want to add some substance to it.

26:28.153 --> 26:31.923
So, my sides are beans
and collard greens and grits.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.559
And then with Chef Melba's
beautiful sweet potatoes,

26:34.626 --> 26:36.928
I'm making some chips in the deep fryer.

26:36.995 --> 26:39.230
They're going to add
a whole other texture to this plate.

26:40.065 --> 26:43.034
Picnic in the South
with Tiff this weekend.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.339
I'm pretty comfortable
with Southern flavors.

26:47.405 --> 26:49.407
I've been in the South for 17 years,

26:49.474 --> 26:51.276
and, you know,
I've learned a thing or two.

26:52.177 --> 26:56.247
The secret to perfect fried green tomatoes
is starting with great tomatoes,

26:56.314 --> 26:58.750
well seasoned flour, oil that's to temp.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.059
What is this?

27:08.126 --> 27:09.494
-Oh-ho-ho-ho!
-More stuff?

27:09.561 --> 27:11.363
A bonus auction?

27:14.332 --> 27:16.935
All right, home cooks.
For this bonus auction item,

27:17.002 --> 27:20.739
I have an ingredient for you
that could elevate all of your dishes,

27:20.805 --> 27:22.807
Melba's Cajun Spice Blend.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.743
-Oh!
-Whew!

27:24.809 --> 27:26.444
This is going to be a buy-in,

27:26.511 --> 27:28.413
so each of you can have one of these

27:28.480 --> 27:30.315
for $1,500 if you want to buy.

27:30.382 --> 27:32.384
Go ahead and buzz in if you would like to.

27:34.085 --> 27:35.153
And take it. It's yours.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.957
Ooh, that's spicy. I like it.

27:39.024 --> 27:42.327
I am using Chef Melba's Cajun seasoning
on everything.

27:42.394 --> 27:45.563
I'm putting it in the collard greens,
in the crawfish.

27:45.630 --> 27:48.299
It's good and I need
to season everything up.

27:49.234 --> 27:52.203
Gonna use Melba's spices here
to give it a bit of that Cajun vibe.

27:52.871 --> 27:55.774
This spice blend has some
amazing Cajun flavors.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.809
Chef Melba, this is perfect.

27:59.878 --> 28:01.646
Home cooks, you have five minutes left.

28:03.648 --> 28:06.685
I need to be a little bit more delicate
with this fish before I break it.

28:06.751 --> 28:10.155
The catfish comes out exactly how I want.

28:10.722 --> 28:13.024
When it comes to sticking to the theme,

28:13.091 --> 28:14.392
I know I've nailed that.

28:14.459 --> 28:18.396
Everything about catfish
and fried green tomatoes is Southern.

28:18.463 --> 28:19.330
Come on, now.

28:20.632 --> 28:23.535
Okay, yeah.
You're burning, you're burning.

28:24.836 --> 28:25.837
Yeah, you did that.

28:26.638 --> 28:29.007
Well, my top buns are burning.

28:29.074 --> 28:30.341
Oh, my goodness.

28:30.408 --> 28:32.577
I've spent a lot of money on these buns

28:32.644 --> 28:35.847
and I'm going back and forth.
Should I use them? Should I not?

28:36.581 --> 28:39.150
It's an open-faced sandwich.

28:39.718 --> 28:43.121
I have no regrets on the money
I've spent on these ingredients

28:43.688 --> 28:46.458
and I hope it's elevated enough
for Chef Melba.

28:46.524 --> 28:49.994
Sixty seconds left.
Remember, get your plates on the line

28:50.061 --> 28:52.630
and hit the red button
before time runs out.

28:53.398 --> 28:57.135
This is not your everyday gumbo.
This has soft-shell crab, beans,

28:57.202 --> 29:00.105
but I'm worried Chef Melba's going
to think it's not authentic enough.

29:01.406 --> 29:05.276
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six…

29:05.343 --> 29:07.479
-…five, four…

29:07.545 --> 29:09.848
-…three, two,

29:09.914 --> 29:12.684
one. All done! Good job, home cooks.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.586
-Well done.
-Good job.

29:14.652 --> 29:16.454
We survived, y'all. We survived.

29:23.862 --> 29:27.766
It looks delicious. I am so excited.

29:27.832 --> 29:29.667
-You want to dig in?
-I sure do.

29:29.734 --> 29:32.771
Here we have a fried catfish

29:32.837 --> 29:35.707
and fried green tomatoes
with a peach sauce.

29:40.545 --> 29:43.615
So we have a saying, "So good
makes you want to smack your mama."

29:43.681 --> 29:46.050
-Okay?

29:46.951 --> 29:47.952
Damn!

29:48.019 --> 29:52.724
The catfish and the fried green tomatoes
exudes Southern comfort.

29:52.791 --> 29:56.528
And the catfish, well-seasoned and tender.

29:57.295 --> 29:59.297
But we have fried here, fried there.

29:59.364 --> 30:01.099
Would've been nice
to add a little freshness.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.333
-Mm-hmm.
-I would have loved

30:02.400 --> 30:03.935
something a little citrusy.

30:04.002 --> 30:06.437
You need some vibrancy,
something to lighten up the dish.

30:06.504 --> 30:09.073
And the sauce could have been
a little more presentable.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.742
I think it's just laid on the plate.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.410
-Yes.
-This is a Spend Box.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.413
It's about presentation <i>and</i> flavor.

30:16.848 --> 30:19.484
-Okay. Ready for the next one, Chef?
-I sure am.

30:20.285 --> 30:24.355
In front of you, you have
an open-faced crawfish sandwich,

30:24.422 --> 30:26.891
grits, beans, and collard greens.

30:26.958 --> 30:30.929
And your mother's sweet potatoes
that have been transformed into chips.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.932
Being a Southern girl,
I grew up eating grits all the time.

30:36.701 --> 30:37.535
Darn.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.271
I think the grits, definitely a hit.

30:40.972 --> 30:45.777
And, oh my God!
My mom's roasted sweet potatoes!

30:45.844 --> 30:47.478
Oh, my God. Do you see that crunch?

30:47.545 --> 30:50.448
-A little caramelization on the outside.
-Oh, my God. Beautiful.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.552
It was a good buy.

30:54.619 --> 30:55.653
It was a great buy.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.755
And upgrade on the bun!

30:57.822 --> 31:00.258
-A lot of upgrades was spent on this, huh?
-Yes.

31:00.325 --> 31:03.795
This home cook was a big spender
at the auction.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.597
You think everything
was utilized properly?

31:05.663 --> 31:08.700
I think that the crawfish
should've been the star of this dish.

31:08.766 --> 31:10.969
-Crawfish, there's not a lot of meat.
-Yeah.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.005
So to have a big bun
with a small amount of crawfish?

31:14.072 --> 31:14.906
Mmm.

31:14.973 --> 31:18.276
So I think it's a lot of money spent
and underutilized.

31:20.311 --> 31:22.380
-Are you ready for the next one?
-I am.

31:22.447 --> 31:25.416
This is Southern-style gumbo
with pinto beans

31:25.483 --> 31:27.952
topped with tempura-fried soft-shell crab.

31:33.124 --> 31:34.225
Mmm!

31:34.792 --> 31:37.662
You know what?
These navy beans are hitting home.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.532
I would not have thought
of using the beans instead of rice.

31:41.599 --> 31:42.500
-Mm-hmm.
-Genius.

31:43.368 --> 31:48.006
Also this tempura-style soft-shell crab
was really divine.

31:48.072 --> 31:51.442
The texture is driving me insane,

31:51.509 --> 31:56.381
and the fact that the okra
was stewed into the gumbo.

31:57.782 --> 32:01.352
It's making me real happy,
but everything is heavy.

32:01.419 --> 32:04.722
We have the gumbo, then crab on top.

32:04.789 --> 32:07.692
It would have been really nice
to have some contrast in this dish.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.760
Mm-hmm.

32:08.826 --> 32:13.998
But this dish is delivering
in flavor and creativity.

32:14.065 --> 32:14.933
Great job.

32:17.402 --> 32:20.104
Lot of tough decisions here.
So do you have a winner?

32:20.171 --> 32:21.873
I know which one hit home for me.

32:25.710 --> 32:26.611
Y'all ready?

32:26.678 --> 32:28.413
-Yeah! I think so.
-Ready.

32:28.479 --> 32:32.450
One of you is about to go home
with all the cash left in your bank.

32:33.251 --> 32:36.621
But first, I'd like to introduce you
to our guest chef and judge,

32:36.688 --> 32:40.058
queen of American Southern comfort food,

32:40.124 --> 32:41.659
Chef Melba Wilson.

32:41.726 --> 32:43.194
-Oh, my God!

32:43.261 --> 32:45.863
Ow! Yes! Yes!

32:46.431 --> 32:48.032
-Yes.
-Whoo!

32:48.666 --> 32:50.335
Okay, let's get to the results.

32:55.506 --> 32:58.876
Now, which home cook made the catfish?

32:59.610 --> 33:00.645
That would be me.

33:00.712 --> 33:04.649
The catfish
was cooked to perfection!

33:04.716 --> 33:08.553
But I would have liked
to have seen a better presentation.

33:09.754 --> 33:12.690
And who made
the open face crawfish sandwich?

33:13.658 --> 33:14.492
That was me.

33:14.559 --> 33:18.096
Your plate really had a lot of color
and some great flavor,

33:18.596 --> 33:22.900
but the crawfish should have been
the star of the dish,

33:22.967 --> 33:24.235
and it wasn't.

33:25.536 --> 33:27.505
Justin, that leaves you.

33:27.572 --> 33:31.409
So you must have made the Southern gumbo
with the soft-shell crab.

33:32.410 --> 33:34.979
Your take on gumbo
was really, really creative,

33:35.513 --> 33:39.050
but your plate,
it really needed a bit more contrast.

33:39.650 --> 33:42.120
So now it's time
to find out who's going home

33:42.186 --> 33:44.088
with all the money left in their bank.

33:45.189 --> 33:48.826
Leanna, you have $9,600 left in your bank.

33:49.894 --> 33:52.797
Tiff, you have $8,998.

33:54.599 --> 33:59.737
And Justin, you have the largest amount
remaining with $9,749.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.775
The home cook with the best dish is…

34:07.311 --> 34:08.146
Justin.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.580
-No way!

34:09.647 --> 34:10.915
Let's go!

34:12.483 --> 34:13.918
Thank you for that surprise.

34:15.620 --> 34:20.958
Congratulations, Justin.
You have now won $9,749.

34:21.025 --> 34:21.926
Whoo!

34:21.993 --> 34:23.561
Thank you, thank you.

34:23.628 --> 34:27.999
Justin, your use of the ingredients
were really, really superb.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.635
-The flavors brought me home.
-Thank you.

34:30.701 --> 34:32.937
I don't think there's a better compliment

34:33.004 --> 34:35.339
than somebody telling you
your dish is amazing.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.309
From a professional chef,
that's just next level.

34:38.376 --> 34:42.013
Justin, you took all of the surprises
that came your way today

34:42.080 --> 34:44.449
and proved that you could
cook at all costs.

34:44.515 --> 34:45.716
-Good job, man.
-Thank you.

34:45.783 --> 34:46.751
-Thank you.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.386
I'm really happy for Justin

34:48.453 --> 34:52.623
and I will never go on a real life
shopping spree like I did today,

34:52.690 --> 34:54.225
but it was sure fun to play.

34:54.725 --> 34:56.327
I may not have won today,

34:56.394 --> 35:00.898
but knowing that I cooked
a great meal for Chef Melba Wilson,

35:00.965 --> 35:02.266
that sealed the deal for me.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.936
This whole experience
has helped me realize

35:05.002 --> 35:06.871
that I'm a great cook,
I can develop flavors

35:06.938 --> 35:09.040
and it gave me a lot more confidence
in the kitchen.
