supposed to do?</i>

00:06.226 --> 00:07.997
<i>Just say the first</i>

00:08.722 --> 00:10.123

00:12.145 --> 00:14.274

01:58.661 --> 02:01.490
Chin up!
Back straight!

02:02.353 --> 02:03.494
I should be able
to draw a line

02:03.519 --> 02:06.229
from your earlobe
to your ankle.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.521
Jackie, the seams of your
stockings are a disgrace.

02:13.753 --> 02:16.221
- Mmm!
- Never bend at the waist.

02:16.513 --> 02:17.612
It's graceless.

02:18.269 --> 02:19.516
Remember:

02:19.541 --> 02:24.512
poised, elegant,
confidant.

02:26.377 --> 02:28.679
Don't you just
love their uniforms?

02:28.713 --> 02:30.444
They always look
so perfect.

02:32.470 --> 02:33.850
I'm thinking
about apprenticing.

02:34.423 --> 02:35.352
If spending 6 months

02:35.386 --> 02:37.673
learning to put on lipstick
and talk in a breathy whisper

02:37.698 --> 02:38.898
is your idea of fun.

02:39.314 --> 02:41.648
Not everyone aces
their Apt Test, Nora.

02:41.673 --> 02:44.220
There's no way I'm gonna end
up cutting hair like my mom.

02:44.479 --> 02:47.446
Besides, stewardesses get
all the prettiest clothes.

02:48.831 --> 02:50.165
Have you seen
Lorelei?

02:51.740 --> 02:53.139
She said
she'd be here.

02:54.444 --> 02:56.373
Are you coming to
the party tonight?

02:56.414 --> 02:59.220
To toast the glorious
tin can? No thanks.

03:04.199 --> 03:06.120
Try not to drool on
the decorations, Nora.

03:13.073 --> 03:14.157
Take off.

03:15.682 --> 03:16.777
Hello!

03:28.331 --> 03:29.929
Nixon! Bordeaux!

03:31.998 --> 03:32.999
What's Bordeaux?

03:34.278 --> 03:35.270
Wine.

03:37.615 --> 03:39.750
There's only 25 bottles

03:39.784 --> 03:42.800
of Chateau St-Cloud '59 left.

03:44.522 --> 03:47.691
After tonight, there'll be 24.

03:48.591 --> 03:51.662
So, do you have
what I came for?

03:51.696 --> 03:52.963
Mmm! Yeah!

03:59.925 --> 04:04.207
I'll be in my cabin at 21:00
after your little party.

04:04.242 --> 04:07.177
Your cabin off
the slaughter stalls...

04:07.702 --> 04:08.621
Enticing!

04:10.314 --> 04:11.782
Is that funny to you?

04:12.160 --> 04:13.532
We had an understanding!

04:21.949 --> 04:24.961
It's not funny, Stokes.

04:24.996 --> 04:25.923
It's sad.

09:35.448 --> 09:36.577
Dad!

09:41.363 --> 09:43.598
Why is my father restrained?

09:43.800 --> 09:46.868
Restrained. "The quality
of mercy is not strained.

09:46.902 --> 09:49.604
It droppeth as the
gentle rain from heaven

09:49.638 --> 09:50.615
upon the place..."

09:50.640 --> 09:52.701
He was agitated earlier.
That's why we called.

09:53.375 --> 09:54.876
His visitor seemed...

09:54.910 --> 09:58.732
Visitor? I'm his only visitor,
and he barely knows I'm here.

09:58.757 --> 10:01.636
I don't know the man,
but he's still on the grounds.

10:02.584 --> 10:05.065
I passed him just outside
talking on his phone.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.151
Why are you
harassing my father?

10:09.858 --> 10:12.022
You're the son, Harris.

10:13.734 --> 10:15.135
Look, um...

10:18.000 --> 10:21.508
I'm really sorry about what
your father's going through,

10:22.344 --> 10:24.244
the stroke, and
what it's done to him.

10:25.149 --> 10:26.873
It must be hellish
to see him that way.

10:28.185 --> 10:29.485
I'm Mark Hayes.

10:30.512 --> 10:31.747
And I didn't mean
to upset him.

10:32.681 --> 10:34.850
I've admired
Dr. Enzmann for years.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.706
I'm doing my
dissertation on his work.

10:38.389 --> 10:39.585
You're an academic.

10:40.028 --> 10:40.670
Yeah.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.757
I'm finishing my Ph.D.

10:42.791 --> 10:44.431
on the history of
the early space program.

10:45.429 --> 10:46.265
It's tragic to me

10:46.290 --> 10:48.454
that most people don't
know who your father is. He...

10:49.798 --> 10:51.063
He inspired me.

10:52.175 --> 10:53.742
He inspired me too.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.479
Yeah, I guess it's
kind of hard to top a dad

10:56.504 --> 10:57.804
who escaped from the Nazis,

10:57.829 --> 10:59.888
and then developed
rockets for NASA, huh?

10:59.913 --> 11:00.685
Hmm!

11:03.189 --> 11:04.692
You ever hear of
Project Ascension?

11:06.815 --> 11:08.470
I haven't heard
those words in years.

11:09.319 --> 11:11.787
Your father
was convinced

11:11.915 --> 11:15.351
that the US could launch
an interstellar spacecraft

11:16.004 --> 11:18.467
right then in the '60s
with the technology we had.

11:19.708 --> 11:21.228
I mean, you can't go faster
than the speed of light,

11:21.253 --> 11:23.955
so the original crew
would never see the new world,

11:23.980 --> 11:25.358
but their descendants would.

11:26.159 --> 11:27.860
Quite a dream Dad had!

11:29.167 --> 11:30.402
I think he did it.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.442
I was taking
you seriously.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.906
No, wait a minute! Look! Wait,
wait, wait! Look, look, look!

11:37.179 --> 11:40.413
They had the means, right?
Kennedy was a fan.

11:41.369 --> 11:44.320
Think of what it might be like!
A mission like no other!

11:44.831 --> 11:46.609
And imagine the
people that went:

11:46.820 --> 11:49.188
Hundreds of people
out there in space

11:49.223 --> 11:52.191
in a world that never
knew the summer of love,

11:52.711 --> 11:56.062
Betty Friedan, the autobiography
of Malcolm X, The Clash,

11:56.979 --> 11:59.699
fresh from <i> Father Knows Best</i>
exploring the universe.

11:59.951 --> 12:01.076
I work for
the government.

12:01.802 --> 12:04.331
Do you have any idea
how incompetent it is?

12:04.356 --> 12:06.739
Do you really think that they
could do something like this

12:06.774 --> 12:08.169
and no one would know?

12:08.976 --> 12:11.377
Ascension
was the military.

12:11.411 --> 12:12.259
It was top secret.

12:14.321 --> 12:15.179
What do you do?

12:15.490 --> 12:18.260
I'm an engineer. I evaluate
government contracts.

12:19.033 --> 12:20.106
Look, before
you write me off,

12:21.642 --> 12:23.236
go see one of your
father's old associates,

12:23.271 --> 12:24.286
whoever's still alive.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.106
Maybe they'll talk to you.

12:25.131 --> 12:28.633
Thanks, but I'll skip
humiliating myself.

12:29.911 --> 12:31.807
You could claim your
father's legacy for him.

12:34.594 --> 12:35.739
This is real...

12:37.196 --> 12:38.212
and the world
should know.

12:47.962 --> 12:49.409
<i>Do you have what it takes</i>

12:49.434 --> 12:50.734
<i>to make a difference?</i>

12:51.134 --> 12:54.302
<i>Apply for a Safety Officer
Apprenticeship today.</i>

12:59.307 --> 13:00.707
Good morning, ladies!

13:00.741 --> 13:03.363
<i>On Ascension,</i>
<i>safety is our priority.</i>

13:25.299 --> 13:26.546
XO, sir, I've been
looking for you.

13:26.571 --> 13:27.813
You weren't in your
quarters last night.

13:27.838 --> 13:30.525
I didn't sleep
there, obviously.

13:31.405 --> 13:32.572
Is that an issue?

13:32.607 --> 13:33.819
No, sir, of course not.

13:33.844 --> 13:35.333
It's just, the captain's
been looking for you.

13:37.445 --> 13:38.384
Carry on.

14:08.506 --> 14:09.396
What happened?

14:09.421 --> 14:11.632
It looks like she fell
and hit her head.

14:12.588 --> 14:13.589
I'm sorry, Duke.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.602
How am I gonna tell my wife
her sister's dead?

14:31.074 --> 14:32.429
Every kid on this ship
knows this place

14:32.464 --> 14:33.730
like the back of their hand.

14:34.077 --> 14:35.366
What are you saying?

14:36.586 --> 14:39.002
I'm saying it's hard for me to
believe it was just an accident.

14:41.917 --> 14:44.508
Marks on her wrists...
It could be from a rope.

14:44.542 --> 14:46.920
Wow! Agatha Christie
would be impressed!

14:47.463 --> 14:49.346
Or have you been
reading Raymond Chandler?

14:49.380 --> 14:50.414
All right, then!

14:50.448 --> 14:52.850
You're chief safety officer.
What's your theory?

14:52.884 --> 14:54.918
She had too much to drink
at Launch Day.

14:54.953 --> 14:56.787
She came out here
for a midnight swim

14:56.821 --> 14:58.119
like we all did
when we were kids...

14:58.144 --> 14:59.953
- Hmm!
- Only she slipped.

14:59.978 --> 15:02.113
Like Dr. Bryce said,
an accident.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.027
Take her
to the medical centre.

15:04.508 --> 15:05.996
She's been out here
way too long.

15:10.086 --> 15:11.535
You really believe
this wasn't an accident?

15:12.379 --> 15:13.303
Look, I know it
may sound crazy...

15:13.338 --> 15:14.890
I want you
to look into it.

15:15.139 --> 15:16.773
If there is
the slightest chance,

15:16.808 --> 15:17.875
we need to be sure.

15:17.909 --> 15:20.611
Captain, I don't have any
experience with anything like this.

15:20.645 --> 15:21.414
Nobody does.

15:21.439 --> 15:23.314
Vanderhaus is your
chief safety officer, alright?

15:23.339 --> 15:24.233
Why don't you
get him to do it?

15:24.258 --> 15:25.791
Look, he hasn't handled
anything worse

15:25.816 --> 15:27.650
than petty theft
or a drunken brawl.

15:28.086 --> 15:31.212
Besides, she's family. He can't
even entertain the idea.

15:32.052 --> 15:32.988
He won't be happy.

15:33.013 --> 15:35.314
Look, I can't worry
about his feelings, Gault.

15:35.623 --> 15:37.424
I have to take care
of 600 souls.

15:37.662 --> 15:39.796
- And you don't want a panic.
- Exactly.

15:39.831 --> 15:40.998
Imagine what it would do

15:41.032 --> 15:42.821
if they thought
a neighbour was a killer,

15:42.846 --> 15:44.760
so just keep this under
the radar for the time being.

15:44.785 --> 15:48.090
- Are we clear?
- Clear.

15:48.631 --> 15:49.289
Okay.

15:52.037 --> 15:54.831
Attention, please!
This is Captain Denninger.

15:56.558 --> 15:58.148
It pains me to report this,

15:58.792 --> 16:01.482
but last night, we lost one of
our own in a tragic accident:

16:02.649 --> 16:03.696
Lorelei Wright.

16:04.945 --> 16:05.489
<i>Those who knew her</i>

16:05.523 --> 16:07.991
<i>said she was a beacon
of light and vitality,</i>

16:08.910 --> 16:11.125
<i>a light that has been
extinguished all too soon.</i>

16:13.071 --> 16:17.514
<i>Her passing reminds us all
of the fragility of life.</i>

16:19.771 --> 16:23.873
<i>Our hearts go out
to those she leaves behind.</i>

16:29.496 --> 16:30.410
Thank you.

16:36.727 --> 16:38.455
Is a full autopsy
really necessary?

16:39.358 --> 16:42.059
I'll also need a blood
analysis for alcohol, drugs

16:42.093 --> 16:44.058
and any other tests
you can think of.

16:45.355 --> 16:46.822
Does the captain
really believe

16:46.847 --> 16:47.877
that Lorelei was murdered?

16:48.174 --> 16:48.932
I'm looking into it,

16:48.967 --> 16:51.656
but remember, the official story
is that it was an accident.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.362
What the hell are
you doing, Gault?

16:55.871 --> 16:57.708
I just have a few questions
for Mrs. Wright.

16:57.919 --> 16:59.553
Hasn't my family
been through enough?

17:00.501 --> 17:02.230
It's fine. If it's
important, it's fine.

17:02.902 --> 17:03.981
Thank you, ma'am.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.965
If there is
anything I can do...

17:09.319 --> 17:10.208
Thank you.

17:14.858 --> 17:17.012
Had Lorelei been upset
about anything recently?

17:19.201 --> 17:20.321
Did she have a boyfriend?

17:20.347 --> 17:22.281
All the boys were
interested in her.

17:22.307 --> 17:23.574
That's no secret.

17:24.769 --> 17:26.069
She didn't run around

17:26.104 --> 17:27.838
like some lower-deck trash.

17:31.320 --> 17:31.908
Can you think
of any reason

17:31.943 --> 17:33.677
that someone might
wanna harm her?

17:33.708 --> 17:34.297
Oh!

17:34.322 --> 17:36.687
Of course not!
What are you implying?

17:36.712 --> 17:37.946
Duke, what is this about?

17:37.971 --> 17:39.372
You know what?
That's enough.

17:39.984 --> 17:42.285
My family and I
would like to be alone now.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.366
Of course.

17:45.687 --> 17:46.901
I'm sorry for your loss.

17:52.697 --> 17:54.057
Let me help you.

17:54.628 --> 17:56.214
We told your mom
you're here.

17:57.673 --> 17:58.946
You were in
a state of shock.

17:59.257 --> 18:00.358
We gave you a sedative.

18:03.599 --> 18:04.808
Christa?

18:05.309 --> 18:06.168
Christa?

18:07.744 --> 18:11.046
In the Glau Room,
they're watching.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.432
They're watching!

18:13.457 --> 18:16.629
Nora, chloral hydrate,
500 milligrams!

18:16.654 --> 18:19.389
No, no, no!

18:19.424 --> 18:21.858
The Globus sees all!

18:21.893 --> 18:23.794
Nora, the sedative!

18:32.745 --> 18:33.744
Is she going
to be all right?

18:36.541 --> 18:37.500
Yeah!

18:38.276 --> 18:40.347
I think so.
She just needs to rest.

18:42.688 --> 18:45.291
Nora, could you excuse us
for a moment, please?

18:51.089 --> 18:53.323
I didn't wanna
say anything before,

18:53.942 --> 18:56.493
but when I administered
Lorelei's psych-eval,

18:56.527 --> 18:58.528
I found some troubling things.

18:58.553 --> 18:59.282
Like?

18:59.307 --> 19:02.733
Frustration,
depression, rage...

19:03.342 --> 19:04.901
She felt like her life
wasn't her own.

19:04.936 --> 19:05.973
The crisis.

19:07.572 --> 19:11.174
Usually, the crisis is
a normal part of coming of age.

19:12.115 --> 19:13.186
<i>We all have to deal
with the fact</i>

19:13.211 --> 19:15.564
<i>that we have no control
over our destiny,</i>

19:15.589 --> 19:18.915
that this was chosen for us
before we were born.

19:19.411 --> 19:21.118
It hit me
when I was 14,

19:21.152 --> 19:24.315
the unfairness that I couldn't
be a pro baseball player

19:24.889 --> 19:26.389
or a secret agent.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.371
Back on Earth, you could dream
as big as you wanted.

19:32.287 --> 19:34.839
Your parents could allow
any illusions to die naturally.

19:35.399 --> 19:37.643
There were an infinity
of possibilities to try.

19:37.668 --> 19:40.670
We don't have infinity.
We only have the ship.

19:41.255 --> 19:43.626
We're born in it.
We die in it.

19:43.651 --> 19:47.490
But with Lorelei, the
crisis seemed more intense,

19:48.083 --> 19:51.611
unnerving in a way
I've never seen before.

19:53.584 --> 19:55.786
I was afraid of
what she might do.

19:58.527 --> 19:59.932
<i>So, what's</i>
<i>this test supposed to do?</i>

20:00.438 --> 20:02.360
<i>Just say the first</i>
<i>thing that comes to your mind.</i>

20:03.197 --> 20:04.164
<i>Father.</i>

20:04.189 --> 20:05.026
<i>I was a baby</i>

20:05.051 --> 20:06.114
<i>when he died in that fire.</i>

20:07.498 --> 20:08.669
<i>Rage.</i>

20:09.867 --> 20:10.930
<i>Ancient history.</i>

20:11.781 --> 20:12.928
<i>Ascension.</i>

20:15.088 --> 20:15.872
<i>Trap.</i>

20:16.495 --> 20:19.034
<i>We have a camera at the
entrance to Water Reclamation.</i>

20:19.443 --> 20:21.077
The beach is a blind spot.

20:22.157 --> 20:23.947
There! This is the time-stamp
you asked for,

20:23.981 --> 20:26.149
but as you can see,
nobody enters or exits.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.573
How could she have gotten
down there without being seen?

20:29.808 --> 20:31.254
There has to be another
way to the beach.

20:32.457 --> 20:33.857
Pull video from the Commons,
track her movements,

20:33.891 --> 20:34.962
find out where
we lose her.

20:34.987 --> 20:36.070
Yes, sir.

20:38.137 --> 20:39.029
Mr. Gault?

20:39.647 --> 20:40.743
May I have
a word?

20:43.063 --> 20:45.266
Emily, they already know I
wasn't in my cabin last night.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.670
Coming to me here,
it's too risky.

20:47.695 --> 20:49.029
I had to see you.

20:49.757 --> 20:50.991
But of course!

20:51.962 --> 20:53.391
I'm sorry about
your sister.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.946
There's something
I have to tell you.

20:58.816 --> 21:01.117
Lorelei was seeing
someone: James Toback.

21:01.152 --> 21:02.686
Why didn't your
mother tell me?

21:02.720 --> 21:05.688
He's from the lower decks.
He works in Water Reclamation.

21:05.923 --> 21:07.324
She was embarrassed.

21:07.365 --> 21:09.935
She wants to maintain this
image of Lorelei as a perfect lady,

21:09.960 --> 21:11.313
but it wasn't the truth.

21:11.662 --> 21:13.296
She was with James
the night she died.

21:13.594 --> 21:15.165
I told her she had
to stop seeing him,

21:15.199 --> 21:16.523
but she threatened
to expose us.

21:16.548 --> 21:17.624
You should've told me.

21:17.649 --> 21:19.183
She wouldn't have done it.

21:19.510 --> 21:20.972
Lorelei could be
selfish at times,

21:20.997 --> 21:23.411
but not cruel,
not like that.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.782
The safety officers came by
Water Reclamation today

21:39.807 --> 21:40.652
looking for me.

21:40.677 --> 21:41.579
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Calm down, James!

21:41.604 --> 21:44.678
Lorelei's dead, and
they're looking for me.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.229
What'd you tell them?

21:46.530 --> 21:48.198
Hey, hey!

21:50.318 --> 21:52.406
You need to learn
some manners, Pup!

21:55.109 --> 21:56.122
Get him out of here!

22:08.581 --> 22:10.535
Her blood-alcohol
level was elevated,

22:10.560 --> 22:12.728
but not enough
to incapacitate her.

22:13.090 --> 22:15.725
However, she did have
sexual intercourse

22:15.760 --> 22:17.294
within hours of her death.

22:17.936 --> 22:19.396
What about the
marks on her wrists?

22:19.842 --> 22:22.065
Your XO might've been right
about those rope burns.

22:22.099 --> 22:25.871
She had contusions on her torso
and a broken collarbone.

22:26.637 --> 22:27.877
So it wasn't an accident?

22:30.841 --> 22:32.871
I also found a fibre
strand in her teeth.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.724
There is a good
possibility she was gagged.

22:36.661 --> 22:37.881
And the autopsy

22:37.906 --> 22:40.151
revealed another surprise:

22:41.555 --> 22:44.503
a small puncture wound
in the roof of her mouth.

22:44.528 --> 22:45.778
What caused it?

22:53.264 --> 22:56.399
Let me know if any new
information comes to light, OK?

22:56.434 --> 22:57.434
Thank you.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.592
Why is the good doctor
calling so late?

23:08.437 --> 23:09.541
Should I be jealous?

23:12.301 --> 23:13.053
What's that?

23:14.478 --> 23:17.381
A bullet, which
begs the question:

23:17.848 --> 23:21.017
How did a gun
get on this ship?

23:32.833 --> 23:35.406
It was a .22 Short,
I looked it up,

23:35.827 --> 23:37.861
an uncommon cavalry
even on Earth.

23:37.886 --> 23:39.053
How'd it get
on the ship?

23:39.340 --> 23:40.825
There were no firearms
on the manifest.

23:40.850 --> 23:43.500
- It must've been smuggled aboard.
- And kept hidden for 50 years?

23:43.525 --> 23:45.426
Yet someone knew
what they were doing.

23:45.451 --> 23:47.349
It wasn't powerful
enough to puncture the hole

23:47.374 --> 23:50.565
or damage the hydraulic systems,
just enough to kill.

23:51.381 --> 23:52.981
I put in an official
comment in the log

23:53.006 --> 23:54.531
and made a communication
to Earth.

23:54.822 --> 23:55.896
Why use the gun now?

23:55.921 --> 23:56.988
The Rubicon, maybe?

23:57.791 --> 23:59.492
Once we pass that
point of no return,

23:59.526 --> 24:02.054
we won't have the resources
to be able to go back to Earth.

24:02.863 --> 24:04.989
We're gonna have to continue on
to Proxima no matter what.

24:05.687 --> 24:07.044
People are
getting anxious.

24:07.069 --> 24:08.836
Yeah, I'm ordering
a complete search of the ship.

24:09.242 --> 24:11.605
If Vanderhaus and his
Jackboots start flipping over beds

24:11.630 --> 24:13.807
and rooting through underwear
drawers, it will cause a panic.

24:13.832 --> 24:14.845
What do you think will happen

24:14.870 --> 24:16.859
when the crew finds out
a murderer's on the loose?

24:16.884 --> 24:19.852
If you tip our hand with a scavenger hunt,
the killer will dump the gun.

24:21.539 --> 24:22.728
Give me a chance
to find him.

24:24.568 --> 24:26.645
Anyone else gets hurt,
it's gonna be on you.

24:31.126 --> 24:32.970
<i>Have a friend feeling blue?</i>

24:34.692 --> 24:36.049
<i>Sign them up on...</i>

24:40.824 --> 24:43.225
Lucy, I'm home!

24:44.304 --> 24:45.304
I placed the treasure

24:45.339 --> 24:47.212
of cinema and
literature before you,

24:47.237 --> 24:48.870
and this is all you remember.

24:48.895 --> 24:51.299
I came looking for books
about how police solve crimes.

24:51.547 --> 24:53.148
"The voice of
thy brother's blood

24:53.173 --> 24:55.341
crieth unto me
from the ground."

24:57.252 --> 24:59.362
Or I suppose sister
in this case.

25:00.533 --> 25:03.556
There are no absolute secrets
on board this ship.

25:03.590 --> 25:04.552
Someone always knows,

25:04.577 --> 25:06.451
and someone always
talks in the end.

25:07.628 --> 25:08.851
I heard a rumour about you.

25:09.107 --> 25:10.738
The captain wants me
to investigate Lo...

25:10.763 --> 25:12.264
The rumour about
you and a woman,

25:12.531 --> 25:15.133
a woman not lawful
for you to love.

25:15.158 --> 25:16.086
Who said that?

25:16.290 --> 25:17.631
You know how
these stories end.

25:18.058 --> 25:21.121
Camelot's gone,
the heroes are dead

25:21.951 --> 25:23.952
and the woman enters a nunnery.

25:23.977 --> 25:27.052
It's always stores with you.
I came here to talk nonfiction.

25:27.244 --> 25:29.322
Police manuals were written
for people on Earth

25:30.231 --> 25:31.798
where cops walk the beat,

25:31.823 --> 25:35.439
and there's an infrastructure
in place to deal with criminals.

25:35.464 --> 25:38.043
- Then what do you suggest?
- Try Philip Marlowe.

25:38.654 --> 25:40.405
He walked
the mean streets alone.

25:41.895 --> 25:43.500
Read detective stories?

25:43.657 --> 25:44.624
That's your idea?

25:45.378 --> 25:46.634
They made a
number of movies

25:46.659 --> 25:48.142
if you're too lazy
to turn a page.

25:48.559 --> 25:50.960
There's also Hitchcock,
Fritz Lang...

25:50.985 --> 25:53.721
Okay, movies! I got it!

25:57.395 --> 25:58.542
What did Lorelei watch?

25:58.567 --> 26:01.834
She liked movies like
<i>Beach Party</i> or <i>Gidget,</i>

26:03.083 --> 26:05.574
anything with blue skies
and sandy beaches.

26:07.494 --> 26:08.633
There was something else.

26:13.247 --> 26:15.091
This is the last thing
she checked out.

26:20.259 --> 26:21.492
The night of the fire.

26:21.886 --> 26:23.656
Are you ready
to open old wounds?

26:27.819 --> 26:28.918
I can take it.

26:30.444 --> 26:31.672
I learned from the best.

26:36.370 --> 26:38.555
The video card...
She kept it.

26:40.218 --> 26:41.079
Why?

26:51.892 --> 26:52.995
What are you
doing here?

26:53.610 --> 26:55.882
It's Okay. Don't leave.

26:57.204 --> 26:59.403
Lorelei brought
me here sometimes.

27:05.053 --> 27:06.943
If she brought you here,
she must've liked you.

27:07.354 --> 27:09.845
Or maybe she just wanted
someone to paint the clouds.

27:11.485 --> 27:16.022
You painted those?
She told me she did.

27:23.788 --> 27:25.372
Lorelei said that if
she was born on Earth,

27:25.397 --> 27:28.521
she would've lived on the
beach and surfed all day.

27:29.769 --> 27:31.569
Maybe one day,
we'll see a real one.

27:32.940 --> 27:35.031
We'll never touch the land,
much less see a beach.

27:35.064 --> 27:37.232
That's not true.
We'll get there.

27:37.688 --> 27:40.561
We'll be old,
but we'll see it.

27:41.784 --> 27:44.123
Face it. Our
grandparents screwed us.

27:45.179 --> 27:47.087
They sent us on a
one-way ticket to nowhere.

27:47.112 --> 27:48.212
How can you say that?

27:48.237 --> 27:50.038
This ship was
a trillion-dollar payday.

27:50.858 --> 27:53.293
50 years ago, a bunch
of people lined their pockets,

27:53.318 --> 27:54.895
and then sent us
out here to die.

27:55.465 --> 27:56.340
They sent us here

27:56.365 --> 27:58.566
to ensure life would
go on no matter what.

27:59.199 --> 28:00.379
Read the history books.

28:00.934 --> 28:02.339
People on Earth
weren't saints.

28:03.781 --> 28:05.529
Lorelei told me some
of the lower-deckers

28:05.554 --> 28:06.819
didn't believe
in the mission.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.418
I guess she meant you.

28:09.863 --> 28:11.268
We're all going
to the same place:

28:12.809 --> 28:13.794
nowhere.

28:14.615 --> 28:16.013
And none of us
have a choice.

28:17.022 --> 28:18.646
I think you're
a little crazy.

28:20.531 --> 28:21.432
Probably.

28:26.129 --> 28:27.540
You know how deep
that tank goes?

28:28.042 --> 28:29.443
40 metres, maybe?

28:30.859 --> 28:31.724
That's wrong.

28:34.568 --> 28:35.826
It goes all the way to hell.

28:56.590 --> 28:58.891
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:58.926 --> 29:00.942
Whoa! Where are you going?

29:00.967 --> 29:01.934
I'm finished.

29:01.959 --> 29:03.420
Well, I'm not!
Get back here!

29:04.126 --> 29:06.280
I'm gonna give back those
silk dresses you gave me.

29:06.523 --> 29:08.319
It's not polite
to return a gift.

29:08.344 --> 29:09.411
As the captain's wife,

29:09.436 --> 29:11.871
it wouldn't be proper
to dress too extravagantly.

29:11.896 --> 29:13.330
Yeah, well, when I'm captain,

29:13.355 --> 29:16.259
you can dress as extravagantly
as you like, okay?

29:16.438 --> 29:17.903
Yeah, and when is
that gonna happen?

29:18.947 --> 29:19.802
The council has moved

29:19.827 --> 29:22.725
to unseat my husband 3 times
already, unsuccessfully.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.497
Well, that's
before this girl died.

29:26.453 --> 29:27.853
An accident in
Water Reclamation

29:27.881 --> 29:30.840
isn't gonna change anything,
except to put up guard rails.

29:30.873 --> 29:32.096
It wasn't an accident.

29:32.121 --> 29:33.770
That investigation
into her death?

29:33.795 --> 29:35.595
Strictly covering their ass.

29:35.620 --> 29:38.128
My sources think
the girl was murdered.

29:38.483 --> 29:40.841
Please! Your sources
are paranoid.

29:40.866 --> 29:43.853
They think your husband is
deliberately downplaying this,

29:43.878 --> 29:45.252
making it
seem pro forma,

29:45.284 --> 29:48.267
when, actually,
this is quite serious.

29:48.292 --> 29:50.672
- To prevent a panic.
- Hysteria, fear...

29:50.934 --> 29:51.657
Let me tell you this.

29:51.682 --> 29:53.250
Any man who can't
control his ship,

29:53.275 --> 29:55.476
does not deserve
to have the word "Captain"

29:55.927 --> 29:56.905
in front of his name,

29:56.930 --> 30:00.314
so why don't you come back here
and finish what you started.

30:00.888 --> 30:02.787
It is fun
to keep a man waiting.

30:02.812 --> 30:05.270
You know what else is fun?
Surprises.

30:10.214 --> 30:11.778
Because finishing
what you started

30:11.803 --> 30:14.538
is never as good
as starting something new.

30:16.529 --> 30:18.230
I love the
way you think.

30:35.105 --> 30:36.511
They found her
lying there like that.

30:36.613 --> 30:37.746
She hasn't said a word.

30:38.167 --> 30:40.052
Thank you for calling me.

30:47.823 --> 30:49.694
You know, when
I was pregnant with Nora,

30:49.719 --> 30:51.169
I would come up here

30:51.474 --> 30:54.743
and daydream about
what Proxima was like.

30:55.607 --> 30:59.538
I'd imagine plants and animals
I'd never seen before.

31:00.147 --> 31:01.680
I like your necklace.

31:04.910 --> 31:06.460
It's a seahorse.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.102
There aren't
any in the aquariums.

31:09.127 --> 31:10.570
No, we didn't bring any.

31:11.016 --> 31:13.851
The only ones are back
in the oceans on Earth.

31:13.876 --> 31:14.949
It's beautiful.

31:16.261 --> 31:16.970
Christa,

31:17.979 --> 31:19.467
you see that
star cluster?

31:19.567 --> 31:23.434
Alpha Centauri is binary,
2 suns orbiting each other,

31:24.571 --> 31:26.250
but when we zoom in
a little closer,

31:26.931 --> 31:28.067
we can see a third.

31:28.444 --> 31:30.996
That's Proxima. That's
where we're going to live.

31:32.034 --> 31:34.349
You're wrong.
There's no life there.

31:38.026 --> 31:41.177
There! That's life.
That's where we have to go.

31:43.031 --> 31:44.586
Everything else is death.

32:02.610 --> 32:04.090
You didn't show up
for work last night.

32:04.307 --> 32:06.190
Is that why your
safety officers pulled me in,

32:06.656 --> 32:07.756
for playing hooky?

32:11.952 --> 32:14.036
Where were you the night
of the Launch celebration?

32:14.464 --> 32:16.498
- The hold.
- Drinking?

32:17.062 --> 32:19.443
Actually, I go down there for
the intellectual conversation.

32:23.053 --> 32:24.745
Your girlfriend
was murdered, James.

32:26.806 --> 32:27.999
What are you
talking about?

32:28.024 --> 32:29.291
It was an accident.

32:30.564 --> 32:31.558
Were you with
her that night?

32:31.583 --> 32:34.630
No! Yes, but early.

32:36.130 --> 32:37.942
- We got in an argument.
- About what?

32:38.679 --> 32:40.102
She didn't wanna
go to the party with me.

32:40.127 --> 32:41.160
Did she say why?

32:41.355 --> 32:42.045
No.

32:44.694 --> 32:46.117
That's just who Lorelei was.

32:47.715 --> 32:49.343
She made you feel like
you were living life on edge,

32:49.368 --> 32:51.680
that things would
fly apart any second.

32:53.691 --> 32:54.838
But it was worth it.

32:56.235 --> 32:57.744
She made you feel like
you were truly alive.

33:02.403 --> 33:03.558
On the medical report,

33:03.583 --> 33:06.277
it says that Lorelei had sex
in the hours before death.

33:08.530 --> 33:09.641
Well, I guess
I wasn't the only one

33:09.666 --> 33:10.993
on the edge with her then.

33:16.316 --> 33:18.808
You won't find your courage
in the bottom of a glass.

33:19.208 --> 33:20.842
Are you calling me a coward?

33:21.309 --> 33:22.036
I would never call

33:22.061 --> 33:23.790
a hero of the
inferno a coward.

33:23.815 --> 33:26.516
I should hope not. We owe
these quarters to my courage.

33:26.541 --> 33:29.304
Unless the thought of going back to
the lower decks appeals to you.

33:29.329 --> 33:31.129
William, I'm trying
to be helpful.

33:31.595 --> 33:32.862
Use this distraction

33:33.356 --> 33:36.191
to ensure your place,
our place, going forward.

33:36.216 --> 33:37.749
A girl was murdered, Viandra!

33:37.774 --> 33:39.312
It's an opportunity!

33:39.871 --> 33:41.972
The council is terrified
of insurrection.

33:42.201 --> 33:44.496
Move decisively,
reassert your position.

33:44.530 --> 33:46.775
Callousness is your
least attractive quality.

33:47.608 --> 33:51.857
Yes, terrible, terrible me,
who took my joke of a job

33:51.882 --> 33:54.129
and turned it into something
that will serve us both.

33:54.154 --> 33:55.888
I doubt your girls
are as pleased.

33:55.913 --> 33:58.000
My girls have
made alliances

33:58.025 --> 34:00.097
with nearly every
powerful man on this ship.

34:00.454 --> 34:02.012
They enjoy their privileges,

34:02.037 --> 34:03.872
and we enjoy the
favours they trade

34:03.897 --> 34:05.664
and the information
they bring.

34:07.601 --> 34:10.429
I'd keep your head in the sand
if it makes you feel better.

34:11.371 --> 34:13.293
I'll go on being
the politician,

34:13.319 --> 34:15.331
so you can pretend
to be the statesman.

34:25.806 --> 34:26.777
Christa!

34:28.913 --> 34:30.525
I'm glad to see
you're doing better.

34:31.284 --> 34:34.062
Would it be all right to ask you
some questions about Launch Day?

34:35.040 --> 34:36.476
Lorelei was gonna
teach me how to dance,

34:36.501 --> 34:37.460
but I couldn't find her.

34:37.485 --> 34:39.020
Do you know why
she went to the beach?

34:39.045 --> 34:41.553
- She was afraid of someone.
- Was it James Toback?

34:41.578 --> 34:44.181
- Not James. He was nice to her.
- Then who?

34:44.213 --> 34:47.706
She wouldn't tell me, but
she said he knew the truth.

34:47.732 --> 34:49.001
The truth about what?

34:51.731 --> 34:53.847
Earlier, you told Dr. Bryce
something about Globus.

34:54.455 --> 34:55.335
What does that mean?

34:55.815 --> 34:57.331
Was it something
to do with Lorelei?

34:57.500 --> 34:59.481
Dr. Bryce had me on
some kind of medicine.

35:01.422 --> 35:02.408
Look, you can tell me.

35:04.591 --> 35:05.819
But I'm a weirdo already.

35:08.681 --> 35:12.047
Sometimes, I think
I know things.

35:12.305 --> 35:13.613
What kind of things?

35:13.638 --> 35:14.953
It's hard to explain.

35:16.203 --> 35:19.204
It's like I can
still feel it...

35:20.723 --> 35:22.133
underneath everything,

35:23.667 --> 35:25.376
behind everything,

35:26.931 --> 35:29.801
like a skull
under the skin.

35:36.532 --> 35:38.100
Good morning, Nora!
Good to see you!

35:38.304 --> 35:39.266
What is that?

35:39.291 --> 35:40.101
You like it?

35:41.198 --> 35:44.773
With full life-support system,
completely radiation sealed.

35:45.132 --> 35:46.432
A couple of more tweaks,

35:46.467 --> 35:48.342
it should be ready
to road test in Proxima.

35:49.997 --> 35:51.771
Dr. Choi, I was wondering
if you've selected

35:51.805 --> 35:53.723
all your apprentices
for terraforming yet.

35:59.213 --> 36:00.060
I have now.

36:00.101 --> 36:00.807
Try it now.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.494
Now, I read your report.

36:04.184 --> 36:06.072
You don't think the
boyfriend killed Lorelei?

36:06.530 --> 36:07.630
No, I don't, sir.

36:08.454 --> 36:09.956
This Toback kid's trouble.

36:11.079 --> 36:12.291
Vanderhaus said
he's been detained

36:12.326 --> 36:14.069
for fighting and
drinking in the past.

36:14.420 --> 36:15.942
He's from the lower decks.
He's had it rough.

36:17.352 --> 36:18.827
Find proof that
he didn't do it.

36:19.738 --> 36:20.967
Otherwise, he's our man.

36:21.254 --> 36:21.896
Bullshit!

36:23.890 --> 36:25.454
You put me in charge
of this investigation

36:25.479 --> 36:28.238
'cause I wouldn't be
bullied, not even by you.

36:28.799 --> 36:30.459
You owe me,
Aaron, all right?

36:30.484 --> 36:31.985
If the council
loses confidence,

36:32.010 --> 36:33.510
they're gonna push me
out of the captain's chair,

36:33.535 --> 36:34.500
and you're not
gonna be far behind.

36:34.525 --> 36:35.925
I'm doing this my way, sir.

36:36.321 --> 36:38.351
If you wanna relieve me,
that's your prerogative.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.514
You know, Aaron, if you
and I weren't born on this ship,

36:41.539 --> 36:43.161
we could've
accomplished great things.

36:43.693 --> 36:45.761
We are doing
something great, sir.

36:47.912 --> 36:49.878
The captain who launched
and the captain who lands,

36:49.903 --> 36:51.427
that's who history
will remember.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.600
The guy in the middle,
who gives a shit.

36:55.855 --> 36:57.663
Handle it your
way for now, Aaron.

37:09.717 --> 37:11.613
- There you go, honey.
- Thanks!

37:12.471 --> 37:14.960
Oh, Harris, that light
is still on in the car.

37:15.886 --> 37:18.377
Harris, are you listening?
You said you'd get it fixed.

37:18.402 --> 37:19.669
Uh, it's just a reminder.

37:19.694 --> 37:20.943
I'll take care
of it this weekend.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.777
Yeah, that's what you said
last weekend.

37:25.213 --> 37:26.446
What are you typing?

37:27.059 --> 37:28.788
It's actually
called texting, Dad.

37:28.813 --> 37:31.281
I know that.
What are you texting?

37:31.612 --> 37:34.239
- Nothing.
- I know what DIAF means.

37:35.136 --> 37:36.680
It means: "Die in a fire."

37:38.329 --> 37:39.647
A kid was giving
me a hard time,

37:39.672 --> 37:42.140
no big deal, so
I told him to DIAF.

37:42.363 --> 37:44.264
- Hello!
- It's just words on a screen.

37:44.289 --> 37:45.920
They're not just
words on a screen.

37:46.652 --> 37:49.094
There's a world in here,
and when you type on it,

37:49.119 --> 37:50.453
you become part
of that world.

37:50.918 --> 37:51.863
You change it.

37:52.337 --> 37:54.329
You have to take
responsibility for that.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.410
Harris, something's
happened at work.

38:39.315 --> 38:43.265
Sorry about your shirt.
Your alibi checked out.

38:46.155 --> 38:48.011
I felt the same way
when I was your age,

38:49.583 --> 38:50.862
that I had no choice,

38:52.346 --> 38:54.431
then I realized this is
what we have to work with.

38:55.881 --> 38:57.690
We find meaning
where we can.

39:00.600 --> 39:01.578
You done?

39:08.647 --> 39:09.949
White shirt,
track him.

39:11.095 --> 39:12.861
He's moving down
the central corridor.

39:15.848 --> 39:17.144
Where's he gone?
I don't see him.

39:17.169 --> 39:18.569
We lost him.

39:18.972 --> 39:20.462
There, A-Deck.

39:20.487 --> 39:21.587
Yeah.

39:25.771 --> 39:26.973
He's headed to the beach.

39:37.701 --> 39:39.046
What are you doing
down here, James?

39:40.035 --> 39:40.887
You followed me?

39:40.912 --> 39:42.335
You know more than
you're telling me.

39:42.697 --> 39:44.668
So, where's the Launch Day
tape that Lorelei took?

39:44.935 --> 39:46.195
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:50.375 --> 39:54.019
You know, I saw the movies she
watched: surf, sand and sun.

39:54.754 --> 39:58.520
She loved nature. That's why
she was drawn to this place.

39:58.545 --> 39:59.687
You call this nature?

39:59.712 --> 40:01.023
Did you actually
watch those movies?

40:02.162 --> 40:05.097
They took it all for granted,
the sky, the ocean.

40:05.482 --> 40:07.289
They could run on the beach
for miles

40:07.314 --> 40:08.676
without slamming
into a bulkhead.

40:09.242 --> 40:13.245
This beach represents everything
that's fake about our lives.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.226
For Lorelei to die here,
of all places.

40:17.441 --> 40:18.698
I don't think
she died here.

40:19.034 --> 40:21.814
There's no video of anyone
but Lorelei coming down here.

40:22.058 --> 40:23.925
There wasn't any sign
of a struggle,

40:23.950 --> 40:25.711
and nothing explained
the marks on her wrists.

40:28.169 --> 40:29.507
There's only
one way in or out.

40:29.532 --> 40:30.356
You're wrong.

40:30.678 --> 40:31.956
There's more than one...

40:33.810 --> 40:34.820
right here.

41:11.444 --> 41:12.359
Stop it!

41:13.767 --> 41:15.434
I know you're there!

41:17.269 --> 41:19.483
Stop watching us!

41:19.981 --> 41:21.390
Leave us alone!

41:22.781 --> 41:24.704
I'm not afraid of you!

41:25.486 --> 41:27.174
I'm not afraid of you!

41:33.423 --> 41:34.552
I should tell
you where we're at.

41:34.577 --> 41:35.968
Trust me, I'm up to date.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.560
I'm getting memos
every 10 minutes.

41:37.585 --> 41:39.419
- What if Warren finds out ab...
- She won't.

41:39.444 --> 41:41.838
There's someone interested in my
father's work, a grad student.

41:41.863 --> 41:42.869
He knows about Ascension.

41:42.894 --> 41:43.829
How much
does he know?

41:43.854 --> 41:46.305
He speculated what the
people on board would be like.

41:46.330 --> 41:48.696
He was pretty convinced
a starship has been launched.

41:48.721 --> 41:51.206
- We need to tell director Warren!
- No!

41:51.724 --> 41:53.307
You're holding off telling her
about this guy,

41:53.332 --> 41:54.931
You're holding off telling her
about the anomaly.

41:54.956 --> 41:56.093
This thing could
blow up in her face!

41:56.118 --> 41:59.329
This is my father's legacy.
I won't have it tarnished.

41:59.493 --> 42:02.134
Harris, the crew isn't safe.

42:02.159 --> 42:04.573
These people have
spent the past 51 years

42:04.598 --> 42:06.360
dealing with the
rigours of deep space.

42:08.050 --> 42:09.749
They're used to being unsafe.

42:29.041 --> 42:32.656
This place is a maze.
My father told me about it.

42:37.995 --> 42:39.493
Looks like someone's
been down here.

42:46.043 --> 42:47.210
"N.F."

42:49.537 --> 42:50.709
What do you think it means?

42:50.898 --> 42:51.946
No idea.

42:55.351 --> 42:56.374
What's this?

43:00.082 --> 43:02.717
Rilke. "Love Poems to God."

43:08.029 --> 43:10.697
All these pages are blank.

43:14.141 --> 43:15.134
Here!

43:23.544 --> 43:25.475
This is where
Lorelei was murdered.

43:28.382 --> 43:29.989
Why would they
bleach the pages?

43:30.251 --> 43:31.785
Everything on board
is electronic.

43:32.042 --> 43:33.606
Writing on
a stenotab is a risk.

43:35.220 --> 43:37.144
Well, this is
the water-filtration system,

43:38.964 --> 43:40.794
the nav-computer blueprints.

43:41.460 --> 43:43.196
A month ago,
the nav computer crashed.

43:43.748 --> 43:45.868
Just last week, the water-
filtration system went off line.

43:45.893 --> 43:47.995
- It's not a coincidence, is it?
- It was sabotage.

43:48.890 --> 43:50.321
- Who are they?
- We're not sure.

43:50.346 --> 43:52.782
But we suspect they wanna
force the ship back to Earth.

43:54.251 --> 43:55.924
Sir, I'm the XO.
Why wasn't I told of this?

43:56.151 --> 43:58.619
We believe the saboteurs
have their routes below decks.

43:58.735 --> 43:59.784
So now I'm a
security risk

43:59.809 --> 44:01.161
because I wasn't born
in the upper decks?

44:01.186 --> 44:03.516
Look, if the council knew how
close we were to insurrection,

44:03.541 --> 44:05.776
it'd be Rose sitting
in this chair, not me.

44:05.801 --> 44:08.436
Search the ship. Turn it
upside down. I want answers.

44:08.593 --> 44:09.536
All right, Captain!

44:13.425 --> 44:16.628
Hey, give me a hand here!

44:22.436 --> 44:23.695
Attention!

44:23.720 --> 44:26.689
Place all contraband
on the tables in front of you

44:26.714 --> 44:28.515
and prepare to be searched!

44:30.811 --> 44:31.736
What's a matter, Duke?

44:33.137 --> 44:34.852
Didn't get this month's payoff?

44:34.887 --> 44:36.249
Step aside, Stokes!

44:38.390 --> 44:39.757
This isn't about Lorelei.

44:40.542 --> 44:45.129
It's about the captain denying
the lower deckers a voice.

44:46.665 --> 44:48.958
Stand down, and
prepare to be searched.

44:49.668 --> 44:52.210
Better get your own house in
order before you come into mine.

44:52.950 --> 44:57.277
I have it on good authority
the chief safety officer's wife

44:57.302 --> 44:58.990
is taking another man
into her bed.

45:00.403 --> 45:01.973
which leaves
only one question:

45:02.756 --> 45:04.324
What's he got that you don't?

45:17.739 --> 45:19.508
<i>Radiation alert!</i>

45:19.533 --> 45:22.338
Stand down! Stand down!
Emergency protocols!

45:22.363 --> 45:24.497
We're heading into
a radiation storm!

45:24.522 --> 45:26.113
Hey! This is not over!

45:26.138 --> 45:28.106
<i>Radiation alert!</i>

45:28.902 --> 45:29.941
Let's go!

45:35.005 --> 45:37.910
According to the ship's radar,
we're heading towards a massive

45:37.935 --> 45:39.578
ion cloud, unlike anything we've seen.

45:39.603 --> 45:42.127
Ascension's been hit with cosmic
rays before. How's this different?

45:42.152 --> 45:44.286
That was before we
reached our current speed.

45:44.311 --> 45:46.603
The radiation caused by
our fractional speed-of-light velocity

45:46.628 --> 45:47.761
will cause fireworks.

45:47.793 --> 45:50.999
- How long do we have?
- Half hour, maybe 40 minutes.

45:51.111 --> 45:53.826
Vanderhaus, have your men clear the decks.
Announce radiation protocol.

45:53.951 --> 45:56.086
Captain, the starboard blast
shields are not closing.

45:56.377 --> 45:58.814
Without shields, the radiation
will burn the ship clean through.

45:58.839 --> 46:01.410
Pump the grey water to the
forward tank, they'll act as a buffer.

46:01.435 --> 46:04.095
Gault, assemble a repair team.
Get those shields closed!

46:12.322 --> 46:13.746
Nixon, I need you!

46:15.179 --> 46:17.133
Oh, what brings
our esteemed XO

46:17.158 --> 46:18.224
down to the lower decks?

46:18.444 --> 46:20.183
Run out of people
to kiss your ass up top?

46:20.333 --> 46:22.105
Nixon, you trained
as an electrician?

46:22.130 --> 46:23.397
I need you onto repair.

46:23.422 --> 46:25.829
You can't just start ordering
us around. We got work to do.

46:25.854 --> 46:27.910
Wrong, Stokes! I outrank you.

46:27.935 --> 46:31.046
That's what that means.
Nixon, let's go!

46:37.497 --> 46:40.066
Nora! Come with me to the
beach. I need your help.

46:40.985 --> 46:42.297
Secure the cart.
I'll catch up.

46:42.603 --> 46:44.285
You heard the orders.
We have to go to our cabins.

46:44.310 --> 46:45.880
Now's the perfect time.
No one will be watching.

46:46.158 --> 46:48.851
- Lorelei told me she hid something there.
- Tell the safety officers.

46:48.876 --> 46:51.678
They haven't been telling the truth,
neither is the captain. Come on!

46:51.703 --> 46:53.805
<i>All hands to radiation pods!</i>

46:53.830 --> 46:56.892
Okay, Captain, we're here.
Nixon's checking the electrical.

46:57.762 --> 46:59.430
The converter's out.

46:59.455 --> 47:00.949
We're gonna need
visual confirmation.

47:01.788 --> 47:03.319
<i>I need an ETA, Gault.</i>

47:04.125 --> 47:05.331
Anytime now.

47:09.329 --> 47:13.265
OK, there it is! I see it.
Looks like A12.

47:13.440 --> 47:14.743
A12. Got it!

47:16.978 --> 47:19.763
We're wasting our time.
The safety officers already searched it.

47:20.641 --> 47:21.687
It's here!

47:22.042 --> 47:23.767
If they found the tape, Gault
wouldn't have asked about it.

47:23.792 --> 47:24.992
What are you doing?

47:25.017 --> 47:27.080
There's one place they
didn't look, in there.

47:27.105 --> 47:28.037
I'm coming with you.

47:42.345 --> 47:43.963
I've never seen
anything like it.

47:43.997 --> 47:45.580
<i>No time for sightseeing.</i>

47:48.871 --> 47:50.911
Captain, the shield doors
are closed.

47:50.936 --> 47:51.903
<i>Good job, Gault!</i>

47:55.208 --> 47:56.976
Nixon? Nixon!

47:57.677 --> 47:59.812
- Nixon, can you breathe?
- Yeah!

47:59.837 --> 48:02.505
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah! I'm good.

48:02.920 --> 48:06.722
No tear.
Pressure suit holding.

48:09.500 --> 48:11.171
<i>All right,</i>
<i>get back to quarters.</i>

48:11.196 --> 48:12.469
<i>It's about to get rocky.</i>

48:37.033 --> 48:38.294
They're pumping the tanks!

48:38.319 --> 48:39.074
Move!

48:54.301 --> 48:55.468
What is it?

48:56.594 --> 48:58.731
It's the missing video
card that Lorelei took.

48:59.421 --> 49:00.698
Come on!

49:01.013 --> 49:02.095
Wait!

49:03.343 --> 49:04.743
There's something
you need to know.

49:05.907 --> 49:07.355
The night Lorelei died,

49:08.585 --> 49:10.391
I saw Stokes
give her something.

49:10.981 --> 49:11.941
What?

49:12.586 --> 49:13.721
A gun.

49:16.990 --> 49:18.924
There is nothing
to be afraid of.

49:18.949 --> 49:20.367
I won't be
able to breathe.

49:20.392 --> 49:23.238
Yes, you will.
It's a mild sedative.

49:23.864 --> 49:25.331
It's gonna put
you right to sleep.

49:25.365 --> 49:26.432
Come on! Hop on in!

49:29.136 --> 49:31.001
The seahorse
will guard you.

49:38.588 --> 49:39.675
Where's Nora?

49:40.081 --> 49:41.313
I thought she
was with you.

49:42.450 --> 49:43.928
Robert, they've
sealed the decks!

49:43.953 --> 49:45.358
Nora's a smart
girl, all right?

49:45.383 --> 49:47.190
There are radiation
pods all over the ship.

49:47.875 --> 49:49.343
We should go. Come on!

49:52.793 --> 49:55.550
And when you wake,
it'll seem like a dream.

50:04.655 --> 50:06.589
<i>Radiation protocol!</i>

50:06.614 --> 50:07.914
Where are you going?

50:07.939 --> 50:08.873
Follow me!

50:09.839 --> 50:12.120
<i>All hands to
radiation pods.</i>

50:12.145 --> 50:13.212
Hurry!

50:14.514 --> 50:16.729
<i>Radiation protocol!</i>

50:20.761 --> 50:21.730
What the hell is that?

50:21.755 --> 50:23.355
Get in! It's shielded.

50:33.492 --> 50:36.086
My grandfather told me once
that back on Earth

50:36.127 --> 50:38.637
you couldn't stare at the sun
without hurting your eyes.

50:39.342 --> 50:42.648
We'll have a sun,
someday, three of them.

50:46.623 --> 50:50.333
If we can get
through this, maybe.

50:54.438 --> 50:57.747
This is Captain Denninger.
We are entering the ion cloud.

50:58.569 --> 51:02.538
Make sure your mask is secure.
There's nothing to worry about.

51:02.956 --> 51:04.482
It's just
a little stormy weather.

53:25.084 --> 53:27.572
All right, I want status
reports from every department,

53:27.796 --> 53:30.087
structural integrity analysis
of the reactor's shielding.

53:30.464 --> 53:31.279
Yes, sir!

53:31.304 --> 53:33.121
Captain, a word?

53:38.824 --> 53:40.758
After we fixed the shields,

53:40.783 --> 53:44.296
Nixon confessed something to me
about Lorelei and Stokes.

53:45.676 --> 53:50.256
All right, ladies,
how are we doing, huh?

53:50.281 --> 53:52.081
Yeah? Good?

53:59.668 --> 54:01.803
Huh! Nixon!

54:02.472 --> 54:03.805
Where is it?

54:04.488 --> 54:05.347
Where's what?

54:05.372 --> 54:06.868
We know you gave
Lorelei the gun.

54:06.893 --> 54:09.976
Screw you!
Ah, shit!

54:12.830 --> 54:14.297
Clear?

54:15.047 --> 54:16.164
Nothing up here!

54:17.595 --> 54:18.899
Now look under there!

54:20.146 --> 54:20.929
Sir?

54:21.737 --> 54:23.238
I found something.

54:27.913 --> 54:29.400
You son of a bitch.

54:30.734 --> 54:31.836
You set me up!

54:36.787 --> 54:38.154
Where have you been?

54:38.899 --> 54:41.100
Your father and I
were worried sick.

54:41.125 --> 54:42.848
I waited out the storm
in the terraforming lab.

54:44.412 --> 54:45.912
Alone?

54:48.488 --> 54:49.753
With James Toback.

54:51.729 --> 54:53.959
How do you think Lorelei
would feel about that?

55:03.849 --> 55:05.453
Is Nora all right?

55:07.295 --> 55:09.297
Yeah, honey, she's fine!

55:09.715 --> 55:11.275
Christa, have you
seen my necklace?

55:11.772 --> 55:13.304
I'm sure that I left it
on the dresser.

55:13.708 --> 55:17.837
You did. He took it
while we were sleeping.

55:18.907 --> 55:21.441
Christa, no one was in here.

55:21.708 --> 55:22.940
Everyone was asleep.

55:23.617 --> 55:25.528
The Globus never sleeps.

55:31.216 --> 55:33.968
Why would I give Lorelei
the gun, then kill her?

55:33.993 --> 55:35.213
This is a setup!

55:35.238 --> 55:37.599
Why would anyone frame
a man who shovels pig shit?

55:37.624 --> 55:38.693
You're not
that important.

55:38.725 --> 55:40.825
You chose me 'cause
you don't think I'm important!

55:40.857 --> 55:41.857
You need a scapegoat!

55:42.244 --> 55:43.268
What about after you're gone?

55:45.219 --> 55:48.456
W-w-what do you
mean "after I'm gone"?

55:48.481 --> 55:50.478
Come on, Stokes, you know
we can't even add a baby

55:50.503 --> 55:51.803
without someone dying.

55:52.585 --> 55:54.519
It'd be a luxury
beyond our means.

55:54.544 --> 55:56.214
Nobody's gonna
spend precious resources

55:56.239 --> 55:57.537
on the killer
of a young woman.

55:58.047 --> 56:01.683
Now, we'd have to do what every
small, isolated society does.

56:01.951 --> 56:03.318
Exile you.

56:04.025 --> 56:05.109
To where?

56:08.158 --> 56:09.776
You're talking about spacing me.

56:13.956 --> 56:16.725
Look, I don't know
who killed her. I just...

56:17.189 --> 56:19.494
She asked for the gun.
I gave it to her. That's all!

56:19.519 --> 56:20.986
Who was she afraid of?

56:22.490 --> 56:24.532
Man, you really
didn't know her, did you?

56:26.641 --> 56:29.131
The question isn't
who was she afraid of...

56:30.361 --> 56:31.908
it's who was afraid of her?

56:40.823 --> 56:42.159
So, the bad man
has been caught,

56:42.184 --> 56:44.552
and now the poor girl
can finally be put to rest.

56:45.006 --> 56:46.406
I think a funeral
is just the thing

56:46.431 --> 56:47.512
to bring this
ship together.

56:47.537 --> 56:49.249
Is there something
you're trying to tell me?

56:49.912 --> 56:51.499
Do you remember
when we were paired?

56:52.168 --> 56:54.556
That romantic day
when they told us

56:54.581 --> 56:57.268
we were number one on each
other's genetic hit parade?

56:58.754 --> 57:00.396
My mother was
disappointed.

57:00.421 --> 57:02.260
You didn't seem destined
for great things.

57:03.079 --> 57:05.710
Yeah, she made that
quite clear at the wedding.

57:06.103 --> 57:07.418
I'm glad you remember it.

57:07.992 --> 57:09.593
I think of it often,

57:10.095 --> 57:11.933
and how I told you that
night that I loved you.

57:13.726 --> 57:15.347
I scared the hell
out of you, didn't I?

57:15.499 --> 57:16.290
Poor man,

57:16.315 --> 57:18.109
you were perfectly ready for
a business-like arrangement,

57:18.134 --> 57:19.635
and I went and spoiled it.

57:22.781 --> 57:24.702
I haven't found
Rose's informant.

57:25.157 --> 57:26.934
It will require
further digging.

57:28.466 --> 57:30.779
We are talking about
your girls, aren't we?

57:31.974 --> 57:33.643
Do you really
wanna know, William?

57:46.407 --> 57:47.523
Mr. Gault?

57:48.339 --> 57:49.392
Christa, yes?

57:49.730 --> 57:52.574
I found this in my cabin,
and I thought you might want it.

57:53.649 --> 57:54.849
It was Lorelei's,

57:54.874 --> 57:59.326
and she told me her
boyfriend gave it to her.

58:00.578 --> 58:01.867
Thank you, Christa.

59:20.865 --> 59:23.293
Lorelei Wright's passing
reminds us of our place,

59:24.406 --> 59:25.754
our limitations.

59:27.790 --> 59:29.023
Individually,

59:29.324 --> 59:31.922
we are but a small part
of something far greater,

59:32.753 --> 59:36.004
greater, yet essential
to the survival of the whole,

59:37.322 --> 59:39.083
essential to
this mission...

59:39.702 --> 59:41.287
essential to humanity.

59:43.462 --> 59:45.230
We take great strength
in this...

59:47.302 --> 59:50.448
as we consign her body
to the infinite.

01:00:39.087 --> 01:00:40.554
Director Warren.

01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:43.187
Harris, you think
I wasn't supposed to hear

01:00:43.212 --> 01:00:44.789
that someone brought
a gun on board

01:00:44.814 --> 01:00:46.250
because the ship
is 50 years out?

01:00:46.275 --> 01:00:47.005
Come on!

01:00:48.235 --> 01:00:49.551
Did one of our
space heroes

01:00:49.576 --> 01:00:50.930
actually commit a murder?

01:00:52.167 --> 01:00:54.080
It would appear so.

01:00:55.212 --> 01:00:56.292
Harris...

01:00:59.011 --> 01:01:00.020
take care.

01:01:00.583 --> 01:01:01.750
Your fiefdom is built

01:01:01.775 --> 01:01:03.929
on your being able to
convince me and everyone

01:01:03.954 --> 01:01:05.755
that you have
complete control.

01:01:06.071 --> 01:01:09.602
Once that erodes,
let me put it this way,

01:01:09.627 --> 01:01:11.695
your life and the
life of this project

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.421
have the same expectancy.

01:01:14.824 --> 01:01:17.306
Director Warren.
What a surprise.

01:01:18.223 --> 01:01:21.646
Excuse me!
Harris, a word?

01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:27.573
We've got a problem.

01:01:49.543 --> 01:01:50.999
I've got something of yours.

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:57.895
It probably should be in your
collection, shouldn't it?

01:02:05.003 --> 01:02:06.825
You know, this belonged
to the first captain.

01:02:07.906 --> 01:02:09.568
You know, people had no idea

01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:12.795
how incredibly difficult
a journey like Columbus' was.

01:02:14.534 --> 01:02:17.111
Astrolabes told latitude
but not longitude.

01:02:18.886 --> 01:02:19.890
Reaching a new world

01:02:19.923 --> 01:02:24.009
was like finding
a needle in a haystack:

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.629
pure, blind luck.

01:02:27.325 --> 01:02:29.677
Is that why you had me
investigate Lorelei's murder?

01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:32.215
'Cause you knew
I'd never suspect you?

01:02:32.336 --> 01:02:33.903
I set you
down this course,

01:02:33.928 --> 01:02:37.010
and now you're ready
to distrust anyone.

01:02:37.035 --> 01:02:38.141
You should've told me.

01:02:40.928 --> 01:02:42.815
I couldn't help myself, Gault.

01:02:43.608 --> 01:02:45.516
Lorelei was playing me
for a fool,

01:02:45.541 --> 01:02:46.812
but I didn't kill her.

01:02:48.718 --> 01:02:50.119
You have to believe me.

01:02:56.085 --> 01:02:58.011
Oh, it looks like I'm
a little late for the funeral.

01:02:58.036 --> 01:02:59.884
Just let the girl go, Stokes.

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:02.878
No, I don't think so.
I'm gonna go before the council.

01:03:02.903 --> 01:03:05.329
Listen, you're only making
matters worse for yourself.

01:03:06.573 --> 01:03:09.808
You think my cell door
just opened itself?

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:13.818
It's a lot easier to
kill someone in a manhunt.

01:03:13.843 --> 01:03:15.823
I will get to the
bottom of it, I promise,

01:03:15.848 --> 01:03:17.985
but for right now,
just let her go.

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:21.157
Someone came in the stockyards
during the radiation storm,

01:03:21.182 --> 01:03:25.375
all right, planted this gun
and... and set me up!

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.881
No... no one was there!

01:03:26.906 --> 01:03:28.415
Nobody could survive
the radiation.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.616
Now listen to me.
Please, let her go!

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.476
All I know is
I saw a boot print

01:03:33.805 --> 01:03:36.306
after the storm where
there wasn't one before!

01:03:40.703 --> 01:03:41.578
Stay here!

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:53.269
The control panel's locked!

01:05:05.421 --> 01:05:07.677
You think I don't
have total control?

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.087
Every detail

01:05:10.592 --> 01:05:14.124
from the movement of the stars
to the flushing of the toilets

01:05:14.159 --> 01:05:16.514
is exactly as it would be
on the real journey.

01:05:17.596 --> 01:05:20.428
The minute they doubt the
validity of their environment

01:05:20.453 --> 01:05:23.154
is the minute
the experiment fails.

01:05:23.652 --> 01:05:25.320
It is magnificent.

01:05:25.345 --> 01:05:26.812
It's more than that.

01:05:27.182 --> 01:05:31.096
Ascension is a lifeboat
for humanity.
