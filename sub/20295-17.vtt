"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.333 --> 00:36.400
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.433 --> 00:38.967
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.000 --> 00:41.167
in a court of law.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.667
-I've been
on the Community Action Team

00:43.700 --> 00:45.200
for about a year now.

00:45.233 --> 00:47.033
Basically, what this team is
is we are liaisons

00:47.067 --> 00:49.400
for the sheriff.
We go to meetings, events

00:49.433 --> 00:51.933
in the community, and interact
on a positive basis.

00:51.967 --> 00:54.967
Go into the areas and try
to solve the issues
that they have,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.200
and try to reflect
in a positive manner
for the Sheriff's Department.

00:58.233 --> 01:01.433
We're en route now
to another deputy that got out

01:01.467 --> 01:03.433
with some individuals
that took off on him.

01:03.467 --> 01:05.367
He's in an apartment complex
right here around the corner

01:05.400 --> 01:07.100
from us. We're gonna
try and assist him

01:07.133 --> 01:08.300
in locatin' those individuals.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.733
It's an area known
for narcotics and loitering.

01:10.767 --> 01:12.533
Goin' in on foot.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.367
Comin' around the back corner
of the buildings over here,

01:20.400 --> 01:21.867
I think it's seven and eleven.

01:21.900 --> 01:25.067
What's goin' on?
Come here! Don't move!

01:25.067 --> 01:26.933
You guys stay right there!
Don't you move!

01:30.300 --> 01:33.067
Stop right there,
you're gonna get tased!

01:33.100 --> 01:35.233
Comin' towards the store.

01:35.267 --> 01:37.300
Comin' back towards
the complex.

01:37.333 --> 01:38.700
Towards Building 29.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.467
(indistinct) figures.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.967
Don't you move!

01:42.067 --> 01:43.067
Don't you move!

01:47.500 --> 01:51.633
(breathing heavily)

01:54.933 --> 01:57.067
8-1-5, I'm at 69 (indistinct).

01:57.100 --> 01:58.167
Turn around.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.467
Come on up.
-Yes, sir.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.733
-Yeah, he in shorts, I think
they were gray in color.

02:05.767 --> 02:07.067
Why you runnin'?

02:07.100 --> 02:09.767
-I was just comin'
to my mama house, sir.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.467
I didn't know if--
if I was gettin' robbed
or shot or somethin'.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.833
-Where's the bottle
you had on you?

02:13.867 --> 02:14.867
-I threw the bottle, sir.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.467
-Stand up.
-That's all I had...

02:16.500 --> 02:18.333
-Ho...

02:18.367 --> 02:20.533
-I'm serious...

02:20.567 --> 02:22.300
-That's a lotta cash.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.400
-Yes, sir.

02:23.433 --> 02:25.300
-I work, sir.
-Where do you work?

02:25.333 --> 02:26.333
-Sir, I work at Amazon, sir.

02:26.367 --> 02:29.167
Oh... oh, my God. Whew.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.833
-I'm happy y'all the police.
-Start walkin' this way.

02:32.867 --> 02:34.067
-Yes, sir.

02:34.067 --> 02:37.133
-All right, 10-4.
Where'd you throw the bottle?

02:37.167 --> 02:39.800
-I'm not sure, sir.
-I know you threw it
somewhere over here.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.200
There it is. Well, would you
look at that.

02:49.533 --> 02:51.767
Stay right here, don't move.

02:54.467 --> 02:55.933
You had somethin' else
in your other hand.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.800
-No, sir.
-Yes, you did.

02:57.833 --> 03:00.167
-No, I had a bottle
in one-- one hand.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.433
-You had a bottle in your hand,
you had something
in your other hand.

03:02.467 --> 03:05.800
-Yes, sir.
I had nothin' in my other hand,
sir, and this is all I got.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.433
-Start walkin' this way.

03:07.467 --> 03:10.100
Now, you walk with me.
I'm walkin' the path he took.

03:14.433 --> 03:17.400
Well, here's your ID
and your keys.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.433
Yeah, the other two took off.
They didn't come down back
towards here,

03:23.467 --> 03:25.867
this one kept runnin'
behind the business
but the other two

03:25.900 --> 03:28.433
headed down this way... prior...

03:28.467 --> 03:31.733
-What am I bein' detained for?
-You're bein' detained
for drinkin' in public,

03:31.767 --> 03:33.867
breach of peace,
-All I was doin' was drinkin'
inside my house...

03:33.900 --> 03:35.767
-and resistin' arrest.
-Inside my house.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.900
-You're on public property.
You're on public property
back here.

03:37.933 --> 03:39.833
-This is my-- this--
this is my-- this is
my house, though.

03:39.867 --> 03:42.233
-The apartment is your house,
outside-- once you step
foot out your door,

03:42.267 --> 03:45.167
you're public property.
Keep walkin'.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.100
Yeah, they're gonna be
on this side of the fence.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.733
He's the only one
that took on this side.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.900
Back this way...
-Red shirt?

03:52.933 --> 03:55.667
-Red shirt, and then
the white, like, camel-type
white shirt.

03:55.700 --> 03:59.100
-Camel?
-I know it was offensive
to be drinkin'

03:59.133 --> 04:01.600
outside my apartment, sir.
-And it's also offensive
to resist arrest

04:01.633 --> 04:03.067
when I tell you
you're under arrest.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.200
-I ain't gonna lie, sir,
this is a very hot neighborhood,

04:05.233 --> 04:07.133
I really thought
I was bein' robbed...

04:07.167 --> 04:09.667
-So when I say, "Sheriff's
Department, stop right there,"
then you took off runnin'?

04:09.700 --> 04:10.867
-I didn't-- I didn't
hear that, sir.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.233
-You didn't hear it,
but you were walkin'

04:12.267 --> 04:13.400
before
I said Sheriff's Department.

04:13.433 --> 04:14.667
-I never was walkin'.
-Okay. Okay...

04:14.700 --> 04:16.167
There's somethin' right here
in the road.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.067
Don't touch that, ma'am.
-He can't go to jail...

04:18.100 --> 04:19.633
-Ma'am... just step back there
for me.

04:19.667 --> 04:21.267
-But that's my son.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.800
-Drinkin' a bottle
in front of your house, Ma.

04:23.833 --> 04:26.933
Drinkin' a bottle in public.
-What about all this weed
right here?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.667
-But that had nothin'
to do with me at all.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.833
You seen me runnin'
with a bottle.

04:29.867 --> 04:31.100
-You can't put that
on him, gettin'...

04:31.133 --> 04:32.867
-At all.
-Do you know what is?

04:32.900 --> 04:35.333
-You can't put that on him.
-Nice big bag of marijuana.

04:35.367 --> 04:38.133
Stay back, yeah, that red shirt,
and then the white shirt
right there, them two,

04:38.167 --> 04:40.233
detain both of them,
those are the two other ones
that took off.

04:40.267 --> 04:42.067
-Both that were runnin',
they're standin' there, sir.

04:42.067 --> 04:43.500
-BJ, be quiet.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.700
-Back there, all three of them
took off on me.
-Okay.

04:45.733 --> 04:48.400
-He was one of them?
-He was-- he was the main one,
he had all this.

04:48.433 --> 04:51.833
-No! I did not have all that!
You seen me with a bottle, sir.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.467
-All right, sir.
-It was a bottle.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.433
I had a Hennessey bottle, sir.

04:55.467 --> 04:57.167
-Y'all ain't gonna
put that on him
if that don't...

04:57.200 --> 04:59.367
-Okay, ma'am, we'll--
we'll get to the bottom,
but I need everybody

04:59.400 --> 05:00.600
to step back for me, okay?

05:00.633 --> 05:04.367
-Come on, man.
That's ridiculous.

05:06.667 --> 05:09.900
-What happened?
-I was comin' around the back,
just-- on regular patrol.

05:09.933 --> 05:12.967
Saw about 10 or 12 individuals
standin' by the corner
of the buildings over here,

05:13.067 --> 05:14.167
I think it's, uh,
seven and eleven.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.267
Um, so I decided to come
from the back side,

05:16.300 --> 05:17.967
I let other units know.

05:18.067 --> 05:21.467
When I came up...
when I came up and I explained
to 'em what's goin' on,

05:21.500 --> 05:24.100
I said, Sheriff's Department,
stop, three individuals
took off runnin'.

05:24.133 --> 05:27.800
The individual I detained myself
took off runnin' behind
the business back here.

05:27.833 --> 05:31.200
-Mm-hmm.
-The bottle he threw, along,
his ID and other things,

05:31.233 --> 05:32.900
and this was located
right here in the middle.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.300
When we came back,
there was several individuals
tryin' to go grab the bag...

05:35.333 --> 05:36.333
-Okay.
-full of marijuana.

05:36.367 --> 05:37.767
-All right.
-Um, so...

05:37.800 --> 05:39.600
-But he was
in the same vicinity?
-It was the same vicinity,

05:39.633 --> 05:42.300
he was runnin'.
-That's fine.
Good. Good job. All right.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.067
Let's get 'em loaded up
and get 'em outta here.

05:44.067 --> 05:46.133
-Yeah, we'll get 'em.
-That way we can take this
somewhere else.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.800
No one's gonna
drop three ounces like that.
-Yes.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.967
-So that's a good--
that's a good lick all day long.

05:50.067 --> 05:52.567
-Yes, sir.
-All right, sir.
All right, so you have the right

05:52.600 --> 05:54.767
to remain silent,
anything you say can and will
be used against you

05:54.800 --> 05:56.700
in a court of law.
You have the right
to an attorney.

05:56.733 --> 05:59.400
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you.
Do you understand these rights?

05:59.433 --> 06:01.433
-I can't understand
what am I bein' arrested for,
then, sir?

06:01.467 --> 06:03.067
-I'll explain it,
do you understand these rights?

06:03.100 --> 06:04.633
-Yes, sir.
-Okay. What
you're bein' arrested for

06:04.667 --> 06:06.633
right now, is... the bottle
of Hennessey, drinkin'
in public,

06:06.667 --> 06:08.833
resisting arrest,
and you're also bein' arrested
for the marijuana.

06:08.867 --> 06:11.667
-Marijuana? Okay, what--
-Did you know anything
about the marijuana?

06:11.700 --> 06:14.633
-Nothing at all, when you
was runnin' after me,
why you say I seen a Hennessey

06:14.667 --> 06:16.833
in his hand?
-So you expect-- you expect me
to believe that you ran

06:16.867 --> 06:18.267
just for the alcohol?
-Yes, sir!

06:18.300 --> 06:21.100
-Okay.
-Yes, sir, I promise you
this-- this is a ghetto area.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.800
I thought we was bein' robbed.
-Okay, I understand.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.633
When I tell you
that I'm the Sheriff's
Department, stop,

06:24.667 --> 06:26.333
-Yes, sir.
-And you still think
you're bein' robbed?

06:26.367 --> 06:28.167
-I stopped and got on the ground
for y'all...

06:28.200 --> 06:31.167
-You were hidin'
behind the dumpsters,
what you were doin'.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.667
-I got down!
-Okay. Also, you
have a large amount of cash

06:33.700 --> 06:35.867
in your pocket. And you tell me
you work where?
-Yes, sir!

06:35.900 --> 06:37.667
I work at Amazon, sir!
You can check that
and all that.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.133
-When did you get paid?
-Every Friday I get paid, sir.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.967
Every Friday, sir.
-So how much money
is in your pocket?

06:42.067 --> 06:44.100
-I don't know the exact amount.
-You don't know
the exact amount?

06:44.133 --> 06:46.100
-No, sir. I have no reason
to lie to you.
-I want you to know

06:46.133 --> 06:47.500
what you're bein' arrested for.
-Yes, sir.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.167
-Possession with intent
to distribute marijuana.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.333
-I appreciate it.
-You're also bein' arrested
for drinkin' in public

06:51.367 --> 06:53.067
for the Hennessey
and resisting arrest.
-Crazy, man.

06:53.067 --> 06:54.067
-Those are your three charges.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.500
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

06:55.533 --> 06:59.067
-Okay, we're gonna put you
in the back of the car
over here.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.667
-I've been
with Richmond County
for approximately

07:00.700 --> 07:01.967
about seven years now.

07:02.067 --> 07:04.600
Been an FTO over the past four.

07:04.633 --> 07:08.600
I've trained 10 to 12
new recruits since then.

07:08.633 --> 07:10.900
I really enjoyed
training them, sculptin',

07:10.933 --> 07:12.267
you know, new minds.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.600
It's just been
a great experience,

07:15.633 --> 07:17.200
um, since I've been out here.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.467
We're en route to a disturbance
call, where a subject,

07:22.500 --> 07:25.067
possibly intoxicated,
broke into a residence,

07:25.067 --> 07:28.700
threatening people with a knife.

07:35.633 --> 07:36.633
-No!

07:36.667 --> 07:39.933
-Walk downstairs.
-Walk downstairs.

07:39.967 --> 07:42.200
-I will walk downstairs...

07:42.233 --> 07:44.633
-Hey, how's it goin', man?
-Y'all just gonna hang out...

07:44.667 --> 07:47.100
-All right.
-Got that?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.067
-He done called us (bleep)
all kinda...
-Where's he--

07:50.067 --> 07:51.633
where's he live at?
-He lives two doors down.

07:51.667 --> 07:55.067
-He done called me
a cracker ass cracker.
-All right, stop. Stop, stop,

07:55.067 --> 07:56.900
stop, stop. Stop.
-All right, I'm sorry, guys.

07:56.933 --> 07:58.600
-What's goin' on
with you tonight?

07:58.633 --> 08:00.633
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:00.667 --> 08:05.133
-I'm sorry, man,
I'm a Marine, dude, I'm not--
-Okay.

08:05.167 --> 08:06.533
-(bleep)
-What's goin' on
with you tonight?

08:06.567 --> 08:08.067
-Hey, I'm fine.
I like these guys right here.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.833
They're good guys.
They just get mad.

08:09.867 --> 08:11.933
Know what I'm sayin'?

08:11.967 --> 08:14.533
-Why'd they get mad at you?

08:17.267 --> 08:18.800
-Come on...

08:18.833 --> 08:20.833
-I don't know, man,
you gotta let me know,
why they get mad at ya?

08:20.867 --> 08:21.867
-Gotta be some kinda reason.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.700
People don't just get mad
for no reason.

08:24.733 --> 08:26.300
-Really, guys?
Come on.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.100
-Yeah.

08:28.133 --> 08:32.067
-You know what?
I'm just...

08:35.167 --> 08:37.467
-Did you break in their house?

08:37.500 --> 08:38.700
-Hell, no!

08:38.733 --> 08:41.467
This one, right here,
right here...
-Uh-huh.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.667
-This mother (bleep)
right here...
All right, what, what, what,

08:43.700 --> 08:45.733
what, what?
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna
put you in handcuffs,

08:45.767 --> 08:48.900
just to calm you down.
-Okay, all right, all right.

08:48.933 --> 08:50.867
-Y'all been drinkin'
together tonight?

08:50.900 --> 08:52.333
-No.
-I don't even drink.

08:52.367 --> 08:54.867
-All right.
-Came over here, called me
a (bleep), talkin' about

08:54.900 --> 08:57.100
Ramadan, talkin'
about Muslims and (bleep)
like that.

08:57.133 --> 09:00.500
-Ramadan, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-All right.

09:00.533 --> 09:03.467
-Did he damage your door?
-Oh, yeah, he broke
the door, he hit it with a bat.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.733
-The guy's
a (bleep) Muslim. Ay.
-Watch your language.

09:06.767 --> 09:09.267
There's no sense to be cussin'.
There's no sense in that,

09:09.300 --> 09:10.933
nobody else is cussin' at you.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.800
-I know, but--
you been to Iraq?
-What's that?

09:13.833 --> 09:15.300
-You been to Iraq?
-No.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.100
-No, you haven't.
-No, I haven't.

09:17.133 --> 09:19.667
But that doesn't give you
a right to come over here
and act like this, though.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.400
-It doesn't? I'm sorry.
-Exactly.

09:21.433 --> 09:24.200
-Uh, uh, uh, uh--
Let's go over here
and have a seat, man.

09:24.233 --> 09:26.467
-All right.
-Okay.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.700
I don't give a (bleep)
what y'all do.

09:29.733 --> 09:33.233
I'm not-- take me to jail.

09:33.267 --> 09:36.300
Take me to jail!
-Take you to jail?

09:36.333 --> 09:37.733
-Yeah, thank you!

09:37.767 --> 09:41.333
-You didn't-- you didn't damage
that man's door?

09:41.367 --> 09:44.400
No, I didn't do nothin'
to his door. I mean, come on,

09:44.433 --> 09:48.067
fellas, I'm mean,
I'm-- I'm tryin' to work

09:48.067 --> 09:50.533
-I understand that, man.
-I'm-- I'm-- I'm--
I'm handcuffed,

09:50.567 --> 09:54.067
I'm-- I'm restrained behind,
and you guys

09:54.067 --> 09:58.100
but, uh, the Muslims
over there are, uh...

09:58.133 --> 10:00.300
you know, ready to blow up
the building.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.467
See that (bleep) tattoo
on my arm right there?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.533
-Yeah.
-That means Marine Corps.

10:05.567 --> 10:07.467
-Yes, sir.
-That means I am legit.

10:07.500 --> 10:11.233
Dude, I'm-- I'm legit.
All right?
-Yes, sir, I believe you.

10:11.267 --> 10:14.600
-All right, well...
why are you (bleep) puttin' me
in restraints--

10:14.633 --> 10:17.100
-Just relax. Nuh, uh, uh,
don't kick the door,
you don't wanna

10:17.133 --> 10:18.233
do that.
-All right.

10:18.267 --> 10:21.033
-Just relax.

10:21.067 --> 10:24.067
All right, guys.
Are you gonna tell me
kinda what's goin' on with him?

10:24.100 --> 10:27.467
-I have no idea, like I said,
he was at the gas station...

10:27.500 --> 10:29.633
and I went over there
to get some soda,
and I seen him out there,

10:29.667 --> 10:31.567
he was drunk.
He was startin'
with people over there.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.167
He was like, "Can you give me
a ride back home?"

10:33.200 --> 10:35.167
He live right there,
you know what I'm sayin'?
I do know him.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.233
So I said, okay, fine,
gave him a ride back here,
he was like,

10:37.267 --> 10:39.967
"Can I have some of your soda?"
I said fine, you know
what I'm sayin'?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.500
Came inside, I gave him
some of the soda,
he started drinking,

10:42.533 --> 10:44.600
he was like, "Do you want
a drink?" I said,
"No, I don't drink."

10:44.633 --> 10:47.300
So then he started talkin'
about fightin' and all this,
and he almost kicked me

10:47.333 --> 10:48.867
in the face. I said, "Man,
you gotta leave."

10:48.900 --> 10:51.167
So I kicked him out,
you know what I'm sayin'?
And he acted like

10:51.200 --> 10:53.867
he wanted me to kick him out,
he went back home,
he came back with a bat.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.267
You know what I'm sayin?
He started hittin' the door
with a bat.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.100
It was like, you know
what I'm sayin'?
What do you want?

10:58.133 --> 11:00.167
Opened the door,
he had the bat in his hand,
I was like, man,

11:00.200 --> 11:02.167
"You need to go home."
I'm gonna call Richmond County
on you.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.200
And he was like,
"Oh, blah, blah, this,"
and (bleep)

11:05.233 --> 11:08.100
and all this other stuff,
(bleep). Started talking
about Islam,

11:08.133 --> 11:10.700
'cause I'm Muslim.
Then he hit the door
with the bat.

11:10.733 --> 11:14.067
I pushed him-- I did push him,
push him down there--
I started to feel threatened...

11:14.100 --> 11:16.800
and then he went back
in the house and he grabbed
two knives,

11:16.833 --> 11:18.900
and he came out,
and he was like,
"I'm gonna kill you."

11:18.933 --> 11:22.233
-All right. I'm gonna
go up there and take a look
at your doors real quick, okay?

11:22.267 --> 11:24.433
-He also started
bangin' on their door, too.
-Okay, did they damage

11:24.467 --> 11:27.367
their door?
-I have-- I have no idea.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.800
-There's a thing right here,
there's a little bit,
I mean, that's the other piece.

11:30.833 --> 11:34.600
-Yeah. He did, he knocked--
he knocked the mess
out of it.

11:34.633 --> 11:39.133
-You see where
he was hittin' it up here, too?
-Yeah.

11:39.167 --> 11:41.333
All right, who's apartment
is this?
-It's mine.

11:41.367 --> 11:45.067
-All right. I'm gonna need
to get your information.
You are wantin' to prosecute,

11:45.100 --> 11:47.433
right?
-Right. I-- I can't
be payin' for this.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.533
-Okay.

11:49.567 --> 11:52.667
-Apparently these
are the knives
that he approached

11:52.700 --> 11:55.533
the room with.
Pretty decent size.

11:55.567 --> 11:59.167
-All right. We got, um,
we got criminal trespass,
we got terrorist threats

11:59.200 --> 12:01.967
and acts,
-(yelling from car)

12:02.067 --> 12:04.367
(kicking the door)
-Ooh...

12:04.400 --> 12:09.267
-All right.
All right, stop.
-Stop, stop, stop, dammit.

12:09.300 --> 12:14.233
-No, no, no,
I got him. No...
-Why you grab my legs?

12:14.267 --> 12:17.200
Why are you grabbin'
my legs?

12:17.233 --> 12:23.900
Hey! Help! Help!
Help! Help! (shouting)

12:23.933 --> 12:27.200
-Stop!
-Hey, the next time I see
you guys in public--

12:27.233 --> 12:29.733
-Be careful what you say, man.
-Yeah, I'm gonna murder you.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.267
Both of you.
-There goes another charge.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.100
-Yeah. Yeah.
-He's threatened
to kill us both.

12:35.133 --> 12:36.733
-(laughing)
-Hey, Brian,
you're gonna be charged

12:36.767 --> 12:38.733
with criminal trespassing
for tearing up the door...

12:38.767 --> 12:43.067
-Criminal at what, man,
on my own property?
-Your neighbor's property,

12:43.067 --> 12:47.333
and also terrorist threats
and acts, uh... comin'
at your neighbors with a knife,

12:47.367 --> 12:50.500
and threatenin' to kill them,
and also threatenin'
to kill two police officers.

12:50.533 --> 12:52.267
on our days off, okay?

12:52.300 --> 12:55.433
We found a couple
empty liquor bottles.
Maybe the drinking's

12:55.467 --> 12:57.400
part of the problem, all right?

13:00.067 --> 13:02.633
-He's workin' on--
-(banging on window)

13:02.667 --> 13:05.133
-He's gonna end up
breakin' my window.
-Yeah.

13:05.167 --> 13:08.067
-All right, man.
We can make this a lot tighter.

13:08.100 --> 13:11.100
You need to stop.
-Let's make it tighter.

13:11.133 --> 13:13.433
-All right.
-Are you guys seriously
gonna charge me?

13:13.467 --> 13:16.933
-Yes, sir.
-I'm a goddamn
Vietnam vet, goddammit!

13:16.967 --> 13:18.367
-All right, bring your leg down.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.433
-You know what? Hey...

13:19.467 --> 13:21.567
(incoherent yelling)
-You gonna calm down?

13:21.600 --> 13:24.567
-Yes.
-All right.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.300
-I started my career
with the Greenville County
Sheriff's Office

13:29.333 --> 13:30.867
over 11 years ago.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.467
It's a job I've wanted
since I was about four
or five years old.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.067
When I'm not workin',
usually find me
fishin' somewhere

13:36.067 --> 13:39.700
in the summertime,
or hunting in the wintertime.

13:39.733 --> 13:44.633
There's no better place
to do that than
upstate South Carolina.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.200
Now we're gonna pull over
this white Cadillac right here,

13:47.233 --> 13:51.067
the-- It's got Kentucky tags
that expired
about five years ago.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.633
Let's see what's goin' on
with them.

14:00.267 --> 14:03.233
283 (indistinct) Lane
in the parking lot
of the Marathon.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.600
Good evenin'.
Master Deputy Jones
with the Sheriff's Office.

14:13.633 --> 14:14.867
How we doin' today?
-Good.

14:14.900 --> 14:17.467
-Need to see license,
registration and insurance.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.400
-Do you know
why I'm stoppin' you?
-No.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.233
-Your tag's expired.

14:21.267 --> 14:22.800
-Okay.
-A lot.

14:24.133 --> 14:26.700
So, do you have
your driver's license
with you?

14:26.733 --> 14:32.067
-Um... it's actually suspended.
-Okay. Well, that's fine,
do you have it with you?

14:32.067 --> 14:34.500
Just so I know who you are,
an identification or something?

14:34.533 --> 14:36.800
-I have an ID.
-You have an ID?
Great. Can you get that for me?

14:36.833 --> 14:38.933
-And mine, sir?
-Yeah, you have an ID?

14:38.967 --> 14:41.100
You don't have it with you?

14:41.133 --> 14:43.433
All right. Can you keep
your hand up where I can see it?

14:43.467 --> 14:46.700
-This is my husband
right here, we're separating.
-Okay.

14:46.733 --> 14:48.867
Do you have insurance
on this car?

14:48.900 --> 14:51.533
-It just lapsed.
-Just lapsed.

14:51.567 --> 14:56.233
Okay.
All right. Look here,
y'all hang tight, okay?

14:56.267 --> 14:59.267
I'll be back up here with you
in just a second.

14:59.300 --> 15:02.467
The plates on the car
that are supposed to be on it
are suspended.

15:02.500 --> 15:06.067
She's suspended
and he is suspended also.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.367
So, we're gonna give her
an option to call a tow truck
of her choice,

15:09.400 --> 15:12.900
and then she's gonna
get a citation for drivin'
under suspension.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.433
-(radio) Charlie 37, 10-4.

15:16.467 --> 15:18.933
-All right. Right now,
you're drivin'
under a suspension

15:18.967 --> 15:20.267
because of a traffic accident.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.800
Is there anything illegal
in the car?
-No.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.300
-No drugs are anything
like that?
-No.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.167
-Do you have a problem
if I look in the car?

15:25.200 --> 15:26.867
-No.
-Okay.

15:26.900 --> 15:31.467
Just tryin' to--
-I mean, I--

15:31.500 --> 15:33.733
-You have a right--
-I'd prefer it if you didn't,
I mean, I'm just...

15:33.767 --> 15:36.367
-I know this is just
pure stupidity on my part...
-Have you got a kilo unit?

15:36.400 --> 15:39.333
-I know it's pure stupidity
on my part.

15:39.367 --> 15:41.733
I'm just embarrassed,
that's why I just
wanna go.

15:41.767 --> 15:43.567
-Well, you
have a right to refuse.
-I know I shouldn't

15:43.600 --> 15:47.467
have been out here anyway.
It was dumb of me
to stick this tag on the car.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.367
-All right.
Just have a seat right here.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.200
Just have a seat right here.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.600
All right... you know anything
about this tag and stuff?

15:55.633 --> 15:58.133
No. I just heard something
about Kentucky?

15:58.167 --> 16:00.933
-Okay.
Why are you wearin' a sweater?

16:00.967 --> 16:02.967
-It was rainin' when she--
-It's June.

16:03.067 --> 16:05.433
-It was rainin'
when she picked me up.

16:05.467 --> 16:07.867
-Let me ask you something,
is there anything illegal
in the car?

16:07.900 --> 16:09.900
-To my knowledge, no, sir.
-To your knowledge?

16:09.933 --> 16:12.700
-To my knowledge, no, sir.
-All right. Are you responsible
for everything in the car?

16:12.733 --> 16:14.600
-Uh, no.
-No?

16:14.633 --> 16:18.067
-This is not my car at all.
-Okay. Go ahead and step out
for me.

16:18.067 --> 16:19.900
Just gonna pat you down,
make sure you ain't got
no guns.

16:19.933 --> 16:21.800
Keep your hands
out of your pockets for me.
-All right.

16:21.833 --> 16:24.700
-Put your hands right up there.

16:27.700 --> 16:30.500
All right, do me a favor?
And just stand right back here
with your... wife.

16:31.967 --> 16:34.400
I've got a canine, it's gonna
go sniff the car.

16:34.433 --> 16:37.467
If the canine does not alert,
we'll give you a ticket,

16:37.500 --> 16:39.300
we're gonna start
workin' on that tow truck.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.700
All right?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.633
-We're good?
-Yup.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.067
-Thank you.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.067
The dog alerted,
so now we're good
to search, um...

16:48.367 --> 16:50.967
All righty, now...

16:51.067 --> 16:54.367
Looks like that's gonna
be our methamphetamines
right there.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.833
Ahhh.

16:59.600 --> 17:02.467
A smorgasbord of pills.

17:04.533 --> 17:07.667
Methamphetamine pipe.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.400
Some straws.

17:10.667 --> 17:12.967
A marijuana pipe.

17:15.267 --> 17:20.467
These are baggies, look like
they're... they're clean,
that's what they use to resell.

17:20.500 --> 17:26.267
And this looks like
their... telephone list
for their drug contacts.

17:26.300 --> 17:30.667
The marijuana that's in here...
does it belong to you?

17:32.833 --> 17:35.467
-No, but, I mean,
I'm taking responsibility
for everything in the car,

17:35.500 --> 17:37.400
I said I would.
-Well, let me ask you this...

17:37.433 --> 17:39.667
does this marijuana
belong to him?
-No.

17:39.700 --> 17:44.367
-Okay. Did he have any knowledge
of this marijuana in the car?

17:44.400 --> 17:46.800
Okay.
This stuff was located
in your pocketbook.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.933
It contains
a used methamphetamine pipe,

17:50.967 --> 17:54.067
a quantity of methamphetamines.
When was the last time
you used meth?

17:54.067 --> 17:58.067
-I'm not trying to blame-- Okay.
Um... yesterday?

17:58.067 --> 18:00.833
-Okay.
I want to explain this to you,
all right?

18:00.867 --> 18:05.700
When I pulled you over,
I already knew
you used methamphetamines.

18:05.733 --> 18:06.900
-Okay.
-All right?

18:06.933 --> 18:08.733
Not tryin' to insult you
or anything...
-Okay.

18:08.767 --> 18:11.433
-But you have-- you're--
you're beginning
to get that look.

18:11.467 --> 18:12.800
-All right.
-All right?

18:12.833 --> 18:15.233
Might be time to seek some help
other than the kind of help

18:15.267 --> 18:17.367
that I'm gonna
give you tonight.
All right?

18:17.400 --> 18:20.400
'Cause this
is just a temporary fix
that I'm doin' tonight.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.833
You're
under arrest, possession
of drug paraphernalia,

18:22.867 --> 18:26.133
possession of methamphetamines,
possession of a Schedule II,

18:26.167 --> 18:29.967
Schedule III
controlled substance,
drivin' under suspension.

18:30.067 --> 18:33.967
All right. Turn
and put your hands
behind your back for me.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.167
-I didn't know
she was doin' it.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.767
When I heard you
say methamphetamines,

18:37.800 --> 18:40.733
honestly...
-I did. I knew it as soon
as I walked up to the door.

18:40.767 --> 18:43.267
-I almost threw up.

18:43.300 --> 18:45.267
-You didn't see
all the flashlights in there?

18:45.300 --> 18:49.467
There's like nine flashlights
in the car, dude.
-I never really paid attention.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.100
-Meth addicts think
that there's some kinda
dark apocalypse comin',

18:52.133 --> 18:54.633
because
they collect flashlights.
They're like Smurfs.

18:54.667 --> 18:58.600
All right? Go ahead
and hang out there
for me.

18:58.633 --> 19:01.333
We'll let him say bye to her.

19:03.433 --> 19:07.367
The window's down,
just don't reach inside
the window, okay?

19:07.400 --> 19:09.967
-Hi, baby. I love you,
all right?

19:10.067 --> 19:12.300
I'll s-- I'll see you
in the morning.

19:12.333 --> 19:17.900
Put me on your visitation list
in case I can't bond you out,
okay? And I'll come see you.

19:17.933 --> 19:20.167
I'll come put some money
on your books.
-Thank you.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.100
-I love you.
-Love you too.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.667
-All right.
You know you're wanted
by the Highway Patrol as well?

19:27.700 --> 19:32.600
For a wreck?
-Um, no, but that's
what I'm going to court for.

19:32.633 --> 19:34.767
-Well, apparently,
you were supposed to already
have went to court

19:34.800 --> 19:36.400
because Highway Patrol's
got a warrant for you.

19:36.433 --> 19:38.567
They've already
got an arrest warrant out.
-Oh, my God--

19:38.600 --> 19:41.400
no, it's June 22nd.
-You're already
listed on NCIC,

19:41.433 --> 19:43.200
so they're gonna be comin'
to the jail to talk to you.

19:43.233 --> 19:45.133
The paperwork
is in my purse, though.

19:45.167 --> 19:46.567
-You've wracked up
enough charges tonight

19:46.600 --> 19:49.467
to set you back
thousands of dollars
in fines.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.667
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.700 --> 19:53.633
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.667 --> 19:54.800
Cover is code three.

19:54.833 --> 19:57.800
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.800 --> 20:06.533
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.567 --> 20:07.733
-(theme music playing)
