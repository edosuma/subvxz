Wait. Professor Granville,
what were you gonna say?

03:37.080 --> 03:40.290
I don't want to tell you

-That is not just any case.
-It's temperature controlled.

had to be stored

1.6 degrees Celsius.

10:52.540 --> 10:55.960
Yeah, she "upgraded"
my blades the other day

this annoying buzzing sound.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.380

11:00.380 --> 11:04.580
Maybe one of us could ask her
to take it down a notch.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.460
How about all the notches?

11:06.460 --> 11:10.170
Yeah, someone
with a rebellious,
anti-authority streak.

11:11.210 --> 11:12.540
Don't look at me.

11:12.540 --> 11:14.290
I didn't listen to her
last semester,

11:14.290 --> 11:16.290
and almost destroyed the city.

11:16.290 --> 11:17.500
You know what?

11:17.500 --> 11:20.290
I think I like it
when Professor G
bosses us around.

11:20.290 --> 11:21.500
It's actually relaxing.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.380
I don't have to think,
like, at all.

11:28.170 --> 11:29.620
I've made a decision.

11:29.620 --> 11:32.460
We need to take the fight
to Momakase.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.210
Ah, well, we could try
her old hideout.

11:34.210 --> 11:36.040
Too obvious.
She wouldn't
go back there.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.670
Or maybe she'll think
we'll think it's too obvious.

11:38.670 --> 11:41.120
Or maybe she'll think
that we'll think

11:41.120 --> 11:42.880
that she'll think
that we'll think--

11:42.880 --> 11:45.670
People. It's the only
lead we've got.

11:45.670 --> 11:46.790
Now, here's my plan.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.920
At dawn, you will raid
Momakase's old hideout.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.960
Ooh. Dawn might be
tricky for me.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.170
I have to be up late
for this fancy dinner thing.

11:54.170 --> 11:56.540
I'm meeting my mom
at a super exclusive meal

11:56.540 --> 11:58.540
prepared by a mystery chef.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.500
She paid a fortune.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.750
-What's with the flower?
-The mystery chef
chooses a color

12:02.750 --> 12:06.920
and only uses
the most expensive
ingredients with that color.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.290
Anybody else notice that
everything Momakase stole

12:10.290 --> 12:12.580
has the color white
in it's name?

12:12.580 --> 12:15.210
Freddy, where is
this mystery dinner?

12:15.210 --> 12:16.790
Let me check
the Internet-vite,

12:16.790 --> 12:19.580
or, "invite," as I call it.

12:19.580 --> 12:21.080
Oh, look. We're going
to the same place.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.830
Ohhh.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.500
(heroic music playing)

12:35.120 --> 12:36.420
(blades buzzing loudly)

12:37.500 --> 12:39.380
If we split up,
we can surround Momakase.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.580
Momakase got away
because you split up.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.210
Stick together
this time.

12:43.210 --> 12:46.040
-But together we're
more vulnerable to a--
-Trap?

12:46.040 --> 12:47.460
She doesn't know
you're coming.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.880
She won't be able
to handle all of you
at once.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.290
See? She does
the thinking for us.

12:52.290 --> 12:53.330
Just go with it, guys.

12:53.330 --> 12:55.120
That's how I get through
most of my life.

12:55.120 --> 12:58.380
Okay, I guess we're
going in together.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.000

Richardson Mole.
Big fan of your work
at Sycorax.

13:08.620 --> 13:09.670
Thanks.

13:09.670 --> 13:11.580
Actually, I'm such
a big fan,

13:11.580 --> 13:13.290
I was thinking of making
a big investment--

13:13.290 --> 13:14.960
Okay, stop
twisting my arm,

13:14.960 --> 13:17.120
I'll take a selfie
with you, young man.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.000
-Boy.
-(camera clicking)

13:19.000 --> 13:21.330
Am I supposed to know
who you are?

13:21.330 --> 13:23.330
-Alistair Krei.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.670
-Still nothing.
-(grumbles)

13:29.670 --> 13:31.000
I made your phone!

13:31.000 --> 13:33.460
I invented the Internet-vite!

13:36.830 --> 13:38.540
Remember, we're not
splitting up this time.

13:41.170 --> 13:43.210
Give up, Momakase!
You're outnumbered!

13:43.210 --> 13:45.380
Let me think about it. No.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.040
(grunting)

13:52.670 --> 13:53.670
Where'd she go?

13:54.670 --> 13:55.580
Fred:
There she is!

13:57.670 --> 13:58.710
Oh.

13:58.710 --> 14:00.080
Stand back.

14:04.710 --> 14:06.210
That's weird.

14:06.210 --> 14:09.170
This is a job
for fire breath!

14:10.540 --> 14:11.710
(all groan)

14:11.710 --> 14:14.540
Okay. Apparently
it's fire-breath proof.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.670
Momakase:
Sorry, kids.

14:16.670 --> 14:18.830
This pantry is impenetrable.

14:18.830 --> 14:20.580
You won't get away
with this, Momakase.

14:20.580 --> 14:23.000
Nonsense. I already have.

14:24.250 --> 14:25.170
Hmm.

14:25.170 --> 14:26.380
What are you
thinking, Freddy?

14:26.380 --> 14:27.880
Impenetrable pantry.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.830
Impen-- Impen.
Im-pantry-able!

14:30.830 --> 14:31.830
Yeah!

14:31.830 --> 14:33.830
(sighs) Never ask him
that again.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.170
(crunching)

14:43.120 --> 14:44.080
Now what?

14:44.080 --> 14:45.500
-(beeping)
-Professor Granville?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.000
I don't know if
you'll get this.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.170
Momakase has us trapped
and we need help.

14:50.420 --> 14:53.170
-This is all my fault.
-Baymax: Yes.

14:53.170 --> 14:55.080
No. Yes. No. Yes.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.330
No. Yes, yes.
No, no. Yes.

14:58.330 --> 15:01.080
Laying your emotional baggage
on a broken robot.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.040
(chuckles) You've really
outdone yourself, Grace.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.120
Baymax: Yes.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.080
(air sputtering)

15:14.710 --> 15:16.380
Let's fix this.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.500
(tool ratcheting)

15:20.380 --> 15:21.460
Oh!

(air whooshes)

15:44.330 --> 15:45.790
(speaking in reverse)

15:46.670 --> 15:47.790
Good enough.

15:47.790 --> 15:50.290
Now let's find
some appropriate
dinner wear.

15:50.290 --> 15:53.330

16:03.960 --> 16:05.920

Hmm.

16:08.170 --> 16:09.290
(blows)

16:10.000 --> 16:11.620
Now, what were
you saying?

16:11.620 --> 16:13.540
-Do not look down.
-Got it.

16:14.330 --> 16:18.000
(Granville screams)
I looked down! I looked down!

16:28.170 --> 16:29.330

16:34.830 --> 16:35.960
(ka-ching)

16:38.710 --> 16:39.880
(beeping)

16:45.540 --> 16:47.460
Mmm. This white
chocolate soufflé

16:47.460 --> 16:50.210
could use a pinch
more sea salt,
don't you think?

16:50.210 --> 16:52.120
I actually think
it's perfect as is.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.670
Yeah, I agree with Liv.

16:53.670 --> 16:56.040
Wouldn't change thing,
Mr. Creep.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.830
(grumbles)

17:00.420 --> 17:02.790
Are you able
to locate the students?

17:02.790 --> 17:06.420
Yes. They are in a small room
behind the cooking arena.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.250
That's it?

17:08.250 --> 17:11.540
You'd think for the price
we paid, we'd get a little
entertainment.

17:11.540 --> 17:14.250
-(bars clang)
-Where is Momakase?

17:15.710 --> 17:18.620
Wait. That's the chef
who tried to poison me.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.710
(gagging)

17:23.250 --> 17:24.250
Gross!

17:26.420 --> 17:28.540
(scoffs) You call
that cutting edge?

17:28.540 --> 17:30.580
This is cutting edge.

17:30.580 --> 17:31.580

17:38.380 --> 17:40.380

17:49.920 --> 17:51.210
(groans)

17:58.880 --> 18:00.670
I may be bad
at fighting,

18:00.670 --> 18:03.960
but I'm really good
at running.

18:19.460 --> 18:20.960

18:20.960 --> 18:22.120

These are not even
in the right order.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.500
Cumin before turmeric, people.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.000
Who stocked this pantry?

18:30.750 --> 18:31.790
Baymax:
Hello.

18:31.790 --> 18:33.040
Baymax, rocket fist.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.120
(door clangs)

18:36.120 --> 18:39.290
Im-pantry-able.

18:39.290 --> 18:40.420
Overdrive.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.290
(whirring)

18:49.330 --> 18:51.460
Are you guys for serious?

18:56.580 --> 18:57.670
(grunting)

19:01.920 --> 19:03.500
I could do this all day.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.000
You're out
of your league here.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.380
But don't worry.
I'll make it quick.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.000
(laughs)

19:22.250 --> 19:23.750
Dinner's over, Momakase.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.920
Yeah, you're no match
for us without your sword.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.040
True.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.040
Good thing I have these.

19:31.330 --> 19:32.710
Honey:
How did you do that?

19:32.710 --> 19:34.210
Why would you do that?

19:38.460 --> 19:39.620
(yells)

19:45.620 --> 19:47.880
-(yelps)
-Wasabi!

19:49.330 --> 19:51.170
(both grunting)

20:05.000 --> 20:06.040
Yes!

20:07.500 --> 20:08.920
No. No!

20:33.170 --> 20:34.330
Yes!

20:34.330 --> 20:38.170
I want to apologize
for being so intrusive.

20:38.170 --> 20:42.120
Heroics are your area
of expertise, not mine.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.670
It's all good,
Professor Granville.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.620
Yeah. We know
you meant well.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.000
Guys! Guys! Guys!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.540
I do not have a mouth.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.620
(clattering)

20:54.790 --> 20:57.040
Why didn't you tell me
I was going too far?

20:57.040 --> 20:59.790
I was just trying to learn
from my mistakes

20:59.790 --> 21:01.460
and be less rebellious.

21:01.460 --> 21:05.540
Part of what
makes you Hiro is
questioning authority.

21:05.540 --> 21:08.540
It's okay when it's
in service of helping people.

21:08.540 --> 21:09.960
Just reign it in when I--

21:11.210 --> 21:14.170
(chuckles)
I'm doing it again,
aren't I?

21:14.170 --> 21:16.170
Yeah, just a little.

21:16.170 --> 21:18.330
(screaming)

21:24.620 --> 21:26.170
(hissing)

21:28.080 --> 21:30.040
Can we talk about
those nails now?
