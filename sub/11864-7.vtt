00:05.255 --> 00:08.291
- Here. Take my picture.
- Why?

00:08.425 --> 00:12.672
Happy thoughts. For my beautiful,
young friend. I love you, sweetie.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.377
- What are you doing?
- Piggy-back ride.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.971
Rube said we can't go where they're going.

00:18.101 --> 00:22.051
Open door's an invitation.
Gotta jump while the door's open!

00:27.235 --> 00:32.478
Why do I keep losing all the things
and people that I care about?

00:32.615 --> 00:34.573
Reapers come and go. That's life.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.693
It's Daisy. Daisy Adair.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.663
- Daisy's a reaper.
- I'll call you Georgia.

00:39.789 --> 00:43.075
I hated her instantly.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.744
I hated her a little less.

00:46.880 --> 00:51.209
I died during the making of
Gone With The Wind. I am an actress.

00:51.343 --> 00:54.842
- You miss your sister?
- I was told there would be cookies.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.925
You pick when I'm stressed
to get into this shit.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.473
- Reggie's principal called.
- She's been cutting school?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.010
- Seems so.
- Where the hell's she going?

02:12.298 --> 02:17.174
I remember learning that
the average human head weighs 20 Ibs.

02:17.303 --> 02:22.012
I know a lot of that is skull and flesh
and hair, if you've got hair,

02:22.142 --> 02:26.602
but that still leaves
a couple of pounds of pure grey matter.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.980
And that means
tons of tiny neurons firing away,

02:30.108 --> 02:35.103
sending little messages to each other
like, "I love to do the salsa"...

02:36.906 --> 02:40.525
.. or testing other neurons
with questions like,

02:40.660 --> 02:43.578
"Why am I only having sex with myself?"

02:45.665 --> 02:49.414
And while we work hard
making our brains work for us,

02:49.544 --> 02:52.794
a little war is quietly under way.

02:54.716 --> 02:59.093
Half of those brains cells
are telling the other half to chill.

02:59.220 --> 03:04.013
Too many firings at once
and we'd be having seizures day and night.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.218
I wasn't about to take that risk.

03:13.068 --> 03:17.148
This is Fiona.
She's going to be joining us part-time.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.863
Helping us get a handle
on that mess in data input.

03:21.493 --> 03:24.363
- Welcome aboard, Fiona.
- Thanks.

03:24.496 --> 03:30.036
I was hoping
you could be Fiona's mentor.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.042
Get her up to speed.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.578
- Mentor?
- Mentor.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.415
Mentor.
A promotion without a pay raise.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.837
Basically, all you do
is peel off these edges

03:41.971 --> 03:44.842
so that they fit neatly in the box.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.051
And once you've filled the boxes,

03:47.185 --> 03:50.519
they are to be filed away
and never to be seen again.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.850
Unless people start to eat paper.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.142
No one's ever gonna look at these?

03:56.277 --> 03:59.481
They don't even bother to label the boxes.

03:59.614 --> 04:04.953
At 12.30 you have a 35-minute lunch hour...
Don't even ask.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.870
- Does anyone ever come in here?
- Not a lot. Why?

04:10.000 --> 04:13.997
- Just feels like a good place to do stuff.
- OK. Like what?

04:14.129 --> 04:16.286
Stuff I like to do.

04:16.423 --> 04:20.420
- Do you have any tattoos?
- No. Do you?

04:20.552 --> 04:22.924
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.724
- What are they?
- Flowers. All flowers.

04:28.184 --> 04:32.229
Fiona, I really don't need
to see the flowers just this second.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.147
Cool.

04:35.984 --> 04:39.602
I'm gonna be in this storage room
all the fucking time.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.738
Fiona, I've been at Happy Time
a long time

04:42.866 --> 04:46.698
and if I'm gonna be your mentor,
I'm just saying, you know,

04:46.828 --> 04:49.449
you can really...

04:50.415 --> 04:52.704
.. benefit from my experience...

04:52.834 --> 04:55.669
- What are you doing?
- I'm stealing pens.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.663
- Well, the really good ones are up there.
- Cool.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.551
When you think about it

05:05.680 --> 05:09.512
half your brain is up there
telling you not to do stuff

05:09.642 --> 05:13.058
and for the first 18 years of my life,
I listened.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.187
And then I died.

05:17.275 --> 05:21.059
Truth is, when you finally do
eat it, or bite it,

05:21.196 --> 05:24.362
or get hit by a flaming toilet seat,

05:24.491 --> 05:26.863
it's not the big stuff you regret,

05:26.993 --> 05:29.615
the "live your dreams" crap.

05:29.746 --> 05:32.782
Near as I can tell, it's the small stuff.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.701
Like not reaching out
to those who needed you most.

05:43.468 --> 05:48.177
Imagine yourself journeying
through a world that is deranged, empty

05:48.306 --> 05:50.797
and devoid of anchors to reality.

05:52.143 --> 05:56.770
That is the daily struggle
for those suffering schizophrenia.

05:56.898 --> 06:00.018
I'm Ronnie Dobbs. I'm a Capricorn.

06:00.151 --> 06:03.520
I really like long walks in the rain
and stuff.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.909
That's your boy.

06:09.035 --> 06:13.365
I've seen them.
I aspire to them. I make contact...

06:16.418 --> 06:22.538
They can no longer distinguish
what is real from what is unreal.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.379
He's not quite right, is he?

06:28.805 --> 06:34.641
See, uh... That's for you.
I gotta go in here.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.762
This one's mine over here.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.525
Oh, well.

06:45.530 --> 06:50.690
Occupational hazard, no? That one's
gonna fall on this one. Blah, blah...

06:52.454 --> 06:54.779
- Yeah?
- It sucks.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.405
- George, wait.
- I have to go after him.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.377
- Rube wants to see you.
- Tell him I'm busy.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.205
He said now.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.459
- What do you mean "clerical error"?
- They had the date wrong.

07:09.596 --> 07:13.095
So this guy Ronnie Dobbs
is not supposed to die?

07:13.224 --> 07:15.182
He dies, just not today.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.635
- See anything you like?
- No.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.899
I've never owned a used car.
I just don't see myself starting now.

07:22.025 --> 07:25.109
My first car
was an 1898 "Systeme Panhard".

07:25.236 --> 07:29.697
It was actually more buggy than car
but it had beautiful lines.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.864
It was a little jarring on my nuts.

07:31.993 --> 07:36.785
Used cars are for...
Well, they're for other kinds of people.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.883
Is there a problem there, princess?

07:48.009 --> 07:50.844
This is not small curd cottage cheese.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.259
- It's large curd.
- And?

07:53.390 --> 07:57.850
And it's just too much curd.
I can't eat it and I won't.

07:57.977 --> 08:02.307
- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing. I like things the way I like them

08:02.440 --> 08:06.189
and I despise
big fat globules of cottage cheese.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.893
- Does that make me strange?
- A little bit.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.023
This Ronnie gives me the creeps.

08:11.157 --> 08:16.282
He looked at me as if he knew
what I was up to. He gave me this weird look.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.785
He's schizophrenic. All he has is weird.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.999
I don't think I've ever been in a used car.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.203
One for you and one for you.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.291
I don't think
I've ever used anything used.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.001
Congratulations.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.921
- I have slept with married men.
- How many?

08:32.053 --> 08:35.090
Can I watch the window washer
fall to his death?

08:35.222 --> 08:37.548
- Sure.
- Oh, can I come?

08:38.518 --> 08:41.804
Ronnie, you cannot
go off your meds again.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.565
I'm your psychiatrist.
I have responsibilities here.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.853
Ronnie, are you listening to me?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.773
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you what...

08:53.908 --> 08:59.994
Why don't you let me be the one voice
in your head that you actually listen to?

09:00.123 --> 09:03.409
Since you've proved
that you can't be trusted...

09:03.543 --> 09:06.378
you're going to be tested twice a week.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.874
It's just urine tests.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.316
It's weird
how they always fall butter-side down.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.526
- Come on, man.
- That's for coming to work wasted.

09:38.661 --> 09:42.742
- You mean drunk?
- I got a sweet beer bong, man.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.452
Yeah?

09:44.584 --> 09:48.451
- Now that I'm dead, can I still get high?
- Have you got some?

09:48.588 --> 09:50.581
- Yeah.
- Great.

10:18.535 --> 10:21.204
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.994
Sorry for sticking you with that job.
If you need any help...

10:25.125 --> 10:27.616
No, thanks. It's done.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.994
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.752
Thanks for all your guidance.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.457
Here. Have a pen.

10:52.027 --> 10:56.854
I realised my favourite trainee
was laying down on the job.

11:04.622 --> 11:09.617
I had been a caring and compassionate
mentor and she threw it back in my face.

11:09.753 --> 11:14.711
I checked the boxes.
You can't just stuff the paper in like that.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.921
- The job was to remove the edges.
- How can you be mad?

11:19.054 --> 11:22.220
- You're not doing your job.
- You said it was bullshit.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.679
So?

11:24.809 --> 11:27.561
So I believed you.
You know what you're doing.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.059
I wasn't disappointed.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.681
I was kind of proud of myself.

11:32.817 --> 11:37.230
I'd convinced her, like me, not to care.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.530
I, George Lass, could be a role model.

11:42.035 --> 11:46.080
- Are you reporting me?
- No, Fiona. I don't think I will.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.625
And with that epiphany,

11:52.754 --> 11:56.917
long-ignored neurons went to work
igniting new connections.

12:00.095 --> 12:03.428
And reconnecting old ones.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.144
Like the memory that when I was a kid,

12:09.270 --> 12:11.975
the tooth fairy never came to my house.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.476
Sure, I lost plenty of teeth

12:15.610 --> 12:19.524
and, sure, I stuck them under my pillow
expecting a cool reward

12:19.656 --> 12:21.945
like cash or candy.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.910
But my mom
thought cash and candy were crass,

12:27.038 --> 12:33.123
so tooth after tooth was instead rewarded
with a thoughtful note meant to inspire.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.329
This sucks.

12:36.506 --> 12:39.922
At the time I thought it was a total rip-off.

12:50.395 --> 12:54.606
Like I said, it's the little things you regret.

12:55.650 --> 13:00.857
The next time I lost a tooth,
it was still under my pillow in the morning.

13:02.991 --> 13:07.035
And then my young brain
started putting it all together.

13:07.162 --> 13:10.613
No tooth fairy. No Easter bunny.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.788
No Santa.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.537
And I know my sister Reggie
must have felt the same.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.238
Time to embrace the glory and be free.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.958
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:57.087 --> 14:02.876
I love the park. Especially
all the beautiful things you find in it.

14:03.009 --> 14:08.348
In case I haven't been clear,
I am undead, not dead-dead.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.807
All those biological urges still apply.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.344
I think I've seen you around. I'm Ronnie.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.723
I'm just sitting here.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.559
You know, as in not talking to anyone.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.483
I thought you were sitting here
because I was.

14:25.615 --> 14:29.150
OK. Another regret
was I never learned to flirt.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.785
I guess it had something to do
with the fear of rejection.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.497
Fortunately, fear's grip loosens
when you're already dead.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.117
I'm sorry. That was rude. I'm George.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.000
- What do you do, George?
- Office work. You?

14:43.133 --> 14:46.584
- I talk to pretty girls named George.
- Oh.

14:47.637 --> 14:49.713
That was lame.

14:51.349 --> 14:57.185
I'm sorry. I'm trying to flirt with you.
It's not really my thing.

14:57.313 --> 15:00.018
And with that,
we weirdly bonded.

15:00.150 --> 15:03.400
The only thing standing in the way
of more bonding

15:03.528 --> 15:09.151
was that I may have been his grim reaper.
I was as close as he's ever been to death.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.819
- Do you want some popcorn?
- No. That's OK.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.497
You know what's crazy?

15:15.623 --> 15:19.242
The human body has over two pounds
of living bacteria in it.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.462
Not human cells, but foreign cells, OK?

15:22.589 --> 15:27.630
Like living creatures that set up
entire communities within our bodies.

15:27.761 --> 15:33.217
We house them,
we feed them, carry them around.

15:33.350 --> 15:35.508
It's a pretty sweet deal for germs.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.640
I'm not really a popcorn person.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.812
I have to go do something now.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.111
He's gonna die.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.659
That guy over there.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.739
Death's coming for him.
You know it, don't you?

15:58.792 --> 16:03.501
I admit he'd caught me
off guard, so I played dumb.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.710
I... I don't know... Huh?

16:07.842 --> 16:10.298
Real, real dumb.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.387
Heads up!

16:23.400 --> 16:25.938
I got it!

16:54.681 --> 16:59.010
You got sloppy. He's seen you
on the scene one too many times.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.979
- He knew he was gonna die.
- The guy on the bike died.

17:02.105 --> 17:05.853
- He knew someone was gonna die.
- So you talked to him?

17:05.983 --> 17:11.654
- He talked to me. I... talked back.
- Young fella?

17:11.781 --> 17:13.988
- Young enough.
- Sloppy.

17:15.617 --> 17:19.319
- What the hell was I supposed to do?
- Not be sloppy.

17:19.455 --> 17:24.996
I know this is cliché to hate your boss,
but you're a real dickweed.

17:25.127 --> 17:29.505
What you're feeling right now,
rage and frustration all knotted together

17:29.632 --> 17:33.879
binding everything from your head
to your digestive tract, that's my life with you.

17:34.012 --> 17:38.223
The guy talked to me.
What was I supposed to do?

17:38.350 --> 17:42.846
Steer clear of people.
Undead live on the fringe of the living world.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.731
We're facilitators, not participants.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.822
These are awful.

17:58.036 --> 18:02.116
What I didn't tell Rube
was that I should be good at this

18:02.248 --> 18:05.582
because I'd spent my whole life on the fringe.

18:16.179 --> 18:19.299
I was determined not to waste another.

18:29.275 --> 18:32.276
She's strange, Clancy.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.895
She's a strange 11-year-old.

18:35.031 --> 18:38.151
She's just going through a difficult time.

18:38.284 --> 18:42.496
She's been "going through
a difficult time" for 11 years.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.825
I don't think that changing schools
is the answer.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.794
In fact, it'll only exacerbate things.

18:49.879 --> 18:54.707
I spoke to Hank. He said
we could borrow against your pension.

18:54.843 --> 18:58.887
We have a great public school
and you want to send Reggie to private.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.090
It seems incredibly stupid.

19:02.100 --> 19:06.098
So let's just pretend
that we have a normal child. OK?

19:06.229 --> 19:11.935
Let's pretend that going to a huge public school
is gonna cater to her needs.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.642
She lost her sister.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.439
And she's lost.

19:16.573 --> 19:21.650
She lives in her head! God knows
what's going on in there. She's inscrutable.

19:23.455 --> 19:26.325
- What?
- Nothing.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.534
I'm not disagreeing.

19:31.504 --> 19:36.332
I'd rather you disagree. At least for once
you'd be committing to something.

19:39.721 --> 19:45.806
Let's see how she feels about changing
schools. It may not be what she wants.

19:45.935 --> 19:51.096
She's 11. How about we make the decisions?
Act like the parents?

19:51.232 --> 19:53.106
Hey, honey.

19:55.445 --> 19:58.280
Your dad and I were just talking about you.

19:58.406 --> 20:02.238
About the possibility
of maybe changing schools.

20:02.369 --> 20:06.532
Maybe going to St Theresa's
over on Hillhurst.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.915
I wanna ride a horse.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.915
I was doing my best
to stay on the fringe.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.721
Looked like someone
had followed me there.

20:23.598 --> 20:26.469
- Why are you stalking me?
- Why are you stalking me?

20:26.601 --> 20:27.930
I'm not.

20:28.061 --> 20:31.679
What were you doing
with that window washer the other day?

20:32.607 --> 20:35.228
I don't know what you're talking about.

20:35.360 --> 20:40.651
Yeah. What I say to you now
is probably the last words that I'll ever speak.

20:40.782 --> 20:43.902
It wasn't a pick-up line.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.953
You saw what I saw
climbing on that building.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.156
It's death.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.328
It's been following me around.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.584
It's come to collect me.

20:55.714 --> 20:57.872
I knew better.

20:58.008 --> 21:00.843
I didn't have his Post-it any more

21:00.969 --> 21:05.880
and I sure didn't see any familiar faces
lurking in the shadows.

21:06.016 --> 21:08.767
It just likes to keep an eye on us.

21:09.978 --> 21:13.181
It watches me all the time
and I'm still here.

21:16.401 --> 21:20.019
# And I'm on my knees
'Cause I need some breathing room... #

21:20.155 --> 21:22.112
I love music.

21:24.576 --> 21:27.031
Well, I like listening to it.

21:27.162 --> 21:30.032
World pop, French club scene.

21:30.165 --> 21:33.498
I could burn you a great CD.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.500
Well, uh...

21:36.629 --> 21:40.627
.. how about you?
What do you like listening to?

21:40.759 --> 21:45.800
Except for the fact that
he was mentally ill and I was undead,

21:45.930 --> 21:48.848
it was starting to feel like a date.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.012
I don't know. Lots of stuff.

21:56.107 --> 21:59.891
- So do you have a boyfriend?
- Not really...

22:01.071 --> 22:03.396
- No.
- That's so strange.

22:04.532 --> 22:08.530
- Why is it strange?
- I mean, it's just really cool.

22:13.458 --> 22:17.242
I mean, when you think about it
it's pretty amazing.

22:17.379 --> 22:20.000
The two of us finding each other like this.

22:20.131 --> 22:24.259
How many billions of people
are there in the world?

22:24.386 --> 22:27.340
And only the two of us can see death.

22:29.265 --> 22:34.342
- We share a gift.
- You're not seeing death.

22:35.897 --> 22:41.057
Well, whatever it is, it's a lot easier
knowing that you see it too.

22:41.194 --> 22:44.859
Listen. I have a job.
I can't stay up all night, so...

22:44.989 --> 22:50.613
I can't sleep. I haven't slept in days.
I'm kind of self-unmedicating.

22:50.745 --> 22:53.450
- You're on medication?
- Was.

22:54.499 --> 22:59.375
Voices. Sometimes I see things
that aren't really there.

22:59.504 --> 23:03.917
So do you hear a lot of voices?

23:04.050 --> 23:07.419
No, just one. I call him the Shepherd.

23:07.554 --> 23:12.381
- Does he tell you what to do?
- He doesn't control me.

23:12.517 --> 23:16.681
He spends most of his time yelling at me,
making me feel stupid.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.185
Mm. Maybe it's my mother.

23:21.818 --> 23:26.813
If I gave speed-racer soap
and a toothbrush, this place would shine.

23:27.741 --> 23:31.026
Nothing too gnarly,
just something to help me sleep.

23:31.161 --> 23:35.657
Insomnia goes with the gig.
It's because we breathe in all that death.

23:35.790 --> 23:39.918
Like working around asbestos.
Oh, there you go.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.286
Thank you. One?

23:42.422 --> 23:44.296
Is one enough?

23:44.424 --> 23:47.460
No. You've got that undead metabolism.

23:47.594 --> 23:51.342
Well, how many
would a normal person have to take?

23:54.309 --> 23:57.760
- Have you got a fella in here?
- It says one.

23:57.896 --> 24:02.474
Your perversions are coming
into disturbing focus, Georgie. Just...

24:21.211 --> 24:25.043
There's a thin line
between crazy people and the rest of us.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.746
We all have voices in our heads.

24:34.933 --> 24:40.176
Our parents are in there,
our doubts, our fears, our desires.

24:40.313 --> 24:45.390
And just like crazy people, we all struggle
to know which voice to listen to.

24:46.903 --> 24:49.275
Maybe one trick to sorting it all out

24:49.406 --> 24:53.154
is being careful which voices you let in
in the first place.

24:54.869 --> 24:59.081
- What are you doing?
- Oh. Um...

24:59.207 --> 25:03.039
I didn't feel you up or anything,
I was just looking.

25:04.379 --> 25:08.079
I slept great.
Whatever you gave me was great.

25:08.216 --> 25:10.541
But I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

25:10.677 --> 25:14.212
We could go get some breakfast.
Do you like waffles?

25:14.347 --> 25:17.099
I'm kinda over waffles.
I gotta get to work.

25:17.767 --> 25:22.228
- Can I tag along?
- Uh... It's work.

25:31.406 --> 25:34.111
I was thinking about
looking at hotels today.

25:34.242 --> 25:38.619
- Something in a suite would be nice.
- I think that's a great idea, Daisy.

25:38.747 --> 25:41.913
- I'm sure you do.
- If you need a place to crash...

25:42.042 --> 25:45.624
- Not in that life, not in this one, not ever.
- OK.

25:48.882 --> 25:54.422
Hi. How did I say I wanted my eggs?
I think I said soft-poached.

25:54.554 --> 25:59.761
These are obviously hard-poached,
so I can't eat them and I won't.

25:59.893 --> 26:02.929
- They'll come back runny.
- I think you're right.

26:03.063 --> 26:07.060
- Because she's gonna sneeze on them.
- OK. Here we go, everyone.

26:07.192 --> 26:11.652
I cannot get enough of your company,
so we'll have a group job tomorrow.

26:11.780 --> 26:14.105
- St Michael's?
- It's a wedding.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.277
Does anyone else find this fucked up?

26:17.410 --> 26:20.613
- Are you familiar with Charlie Chaplin?
- The silent movie guy?

26:20.747 --> 26:22.989
I once blew Charlie Chaplin.

26:23.124 --> 26:26.624
Chaplin defined that thin line
between comedy and tragedy.

26:26.753 --> 26:30.453
You see some slob get hit in the head
with a bucket of wet cement.

26:30.590 --> 26:35.548
From 20 feet away it's funny as hell,
but get close enough to see that pain...

26:36.638 --> 26:38.963
.. then it's no longer funny.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.720
- OK.
- It's like that with jobs like this.

26:41.851 --> 26:45.552
You gotta learn to step back
like the rest of us have.

26:45.689 --> 26:49.556
Far enough
to see the funny in everything.

26:49.693 --> 26:52.230
- You wanna come shopping?
- Not really.

26:52.362 --> 26:55.731
- You need to blend in.
- I have to get dressed up?

26:55.865 --> 27:00.243
Yeah. We get to see
what you look like all gussied up.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.410
Do you know this guy?

27:07.085 --> 27:10.418
- No.
- He definitely knows one of us.

27:11.965 --> 27:16.793
- He's cute in a "check the oil" way.
- Excuse me.

27:23.852 --> 27:28.099
- He's sniffed out your boy, Georgie.
- Her boy? Nice.

27:28.231 --> 27:32.015
Georgie girl has had him
stashed away in her flat.

27:32.152 --> 27:34.310
Good for you!

27:35.030 --> 27:39.323
- You work with George?
- She told you that?

27:40.618 --> 27:43.026
She said she was going to work.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.916
Does it look like we're working?

27:52.505 --> 27:55.175
- No.
- We just come here to talk.

27:55.300 --> 27:58.503
We're sort of a group and I sort of lead it.

27:58.636 --> 28:01.044
- You're a doctor?
- Yeah.

28:02.891 --> 28:04.967
Thank you.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.813
I dare you not to love it.

28:18.365 --> 28:21.235
So that's like a group session over there?

28:22.118 --> 28:24.277
Yeah. That's my group.

28:26.414 --> 28:30.198
- How's the bear claw?
- It's good.

28:30.335 --> 28:33.704
- I'm Rube.
- Ronnie.

28:36.341 --> 28:39.508
This is a little hard for me, Ronnie,

28:39.636 --> 28:43.799
and I'm choosing my words carefully,
being George's doctor and all.

28:44.766 --> 28:48.633
Even though she's living on her own
away from the facility,

28:48.770 --> 28:53.432
I try to get a feel for the quality of people
she hangs out with.

28:53.566 --> 28:57.267
I'm just saying whatever
you've got planned, be careful.

28:57.404 --> 29:00.404
She's had a tough row in life.

29:00.532 --> 29:04.481
Frankly, she can be a danger to herself
when stressed.

29:06.162 --> 29:09.163
And others. Follow?

29:09.874 --> 29:12.828
- I think so.
- Good. You seem like a good kid.

29:12.961 --> 29:16.959
I'd appreciate it if you'd leave.
You're making my group anxious.

29:19.884 --> 29:21.794
OK.

29:25.640 --> 29:30.267
Head out. George and I need to talk.
I gotta make a sissy.

29:46.494 --> 29:50.872
Well, she's still on the horse,
so I guess that's a good thing.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.873
I guess.

30:06.139 --> 30:11.382
I didn't pick the guy up. He said he could
see gravelings. You can't get mad at me.

30:11.519 --> 30:14.604
- Do I look mad?
- A little.

30:16.232 --> 30:17.976
Thank you.

30:18.902 --> 30:24.027
Do you know what would happen if the living
knew we were here among them?

30:24.991 --> 30:27.565
It would up-end the world.

30:27.702 --> 30:32.448
Believe me. You do not want to be
responsible for a Biblical panic.

30:32.582 --> 30:34.409
I didn't tell him anything.

30:34.542 --> 30:38.077
You didn't say you were a reaper?
Or talk about gravelings?

30:38.254 --> 30:43.082
I said that I could see them too.
That's all. He thinks they're death.

30:43.218 --> 30:47.927
- He told you he's schizophrenic?
- He said he's on medication for seeing things.

30:50.100 --> 30:55.556
Well, maybe what we really have
is a mentally unstable young man

30:55.689 --> 30:57.811
who thinks you're the cat's meow.

30:57.941 --> 31:02.270
So this is all some plot on his part
to get in my pants?

31:02.404 --> 31:05.855
All men are liars
where pretty girls are implicated.

31:05.990 --> 31:09.656
You can see their noses growing.
Trust me.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.327
So you think I'm pretty.

31:15.417 --> 31:19.746
- Do you like convertibles?
- Yeah. I guess.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.499
I once gave Errol Flynn a hand-job
in a convertible.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.002
That's a nice story.

31:28.930 --> 31:32.133
So tell me about this guy.

31:32.267 --> 31:35.683
What's there to tell?
He's crazy and he sees gravelings.

31:35.812 --> 31:38.979
- That's a first.
- Rube says it's not possible.

31:39.107 --> 31:41.645
- That's Rube.
- What do you mean?

31:41.776 --> 31:46.355
If he can't wrap his brain around
something unexplained it doesn't exist.

31:46.489 --> 31:49.194
It's sad, really. Do you like him?

31:51.411 --> 31:53.902
Did I mention he's crazy?

31:54.998 --> 31:57.074
What kind of car is that?

31:58.752 --> 32:00.958
I am a sucker for platinum.

32:04.007 --> 32:07.423
- What are you doing?
- Getting us a ride.

32:12.265 --> 32:14.803
I love your car.

32:14.934 --> 32:17.770
Thanks. I love your breasts.

32:17.896 --> 32:21.062
Do you have room for two?
We're trying to get downtown.

32:21.191 --> 32:25.188
Sure. I'll just get this out of here.

32:37.791 --> 32:40.364
Hey! What the fuck! Hey!

32:45.882 --> 32:51.173
I thought it was really something
this morning seeing you up on that horse.

32:51.304 --> 32:53.261
Here.

32:55.517 --> 32:58.221
I used to ride when I was young.

32:58.353 --> 33:03.229
There was a stable within walking distance
of Grandma Phyl's house.

33:18.540 --> 33:21.244
I don't want this.

33:21.376 --> 33:26.583
- Excuse me?
- I don't like riding. It makes my hips hurt.

33:27.340 --> 33:29.914
- Oh.
- I want this.

33:31.553 --> 33:34.886
- A drum set?
- Yeah.

33:37.726 --> 33:41.723
Well, my job is not to give you
your every desire.

33:41.855 --> 33:45.021
Especially when you
throw it back in my face.

33:46.776 --> 33:49.563
In future, when someone gives you a gift,

33:49.696 --> 33:54.654
you might want to have the decency
to say thank you, even if you hate it.

33:56.911 --> 33:59.367
Thank you.

33:59.497 --> 34:02.913
Why does everything
always have to be such a struggle?

34:04.961 --> 34:07.203
I don't know.

34:08.297 --> 34:10.206
- Right.
- I don't.

34:15.722 --> 34:19.719
Grandma Phyl was very supportive
of my love of horses.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.469
She bought me lessons.

34:23.605 --> 34:27.103
Even bought me
a handmade saddle from Spain.

34:27.233 --> 34:30.400
I used to ride every day after school
and weekends.

34:30.527 --> 34:35.440
She wanted me to be good enough
to compete... which I hated.

34:35.574 --> 34:39.952
At the time I thought
she was giving me what I wanted.

34:41.831 --> 34:45.876
- I suppose you'll want lessons.
- I figured I'd just teach myself.

34:50.090 --> 34:55.001
I'll have to talk to your father.
You know how he likes a quiet house.

35:01.434 --> 35:05.052
I'm not a big fan of weddings,
but a job is a job.

35:05.855 --> 35:11.016
So I sat there watching those 50 happy people
gathered to celebrate a marriage,

35:11.194 --> 35:13.602
dressed in their Sunday best,

35:14.155 --> 35:16.729
about to hear
some priest's flowery words

35:17.534 --> 35:21.697
about the joining together of two souls,
uniting as one, blah-blah, blah, blah...

35:22.622 --> 35:24.911
Until death do them part...

35:25.458 --> 35:28.625
.. which would be in about 11 minutes.

35:29.379 --> 35:30.956
Hey.

35:33.258 --> 35:36.175
- You gotta get out of here.
- I need to talk.

35:36.302 --> 35:39.885
- Not right now.
- Please.

35:43.727 --> 35:44.841
Come on.

35:48.356 --> 35:50.563
How did you find me?

35:50.692 --> 35:55.520
I waited outside your building
and the rest was pretty easy.

35:55.655 --> 35:59.024
- Did I see your doctor in there?
- Doctor?

35:59.159 --> 36:04.034
- Rube.
- He might be. We run in the same circle.

36:04.164 --> 36:06.737
What is it you have to say?

36:08.168 --> 36:12.545
- I just wanted to kiss you.
- No... No way. I can't...

36:14.883 --> 36:17.837
It was my first post-death kiss.

36:17.969 --> 36:20.377
That alone made it memorable.

36:22.182 --> 36:24.851
Actually, I came to say goodbye.

36:24.976 --> 36:27.847
And my first post-death kiss off.

36:27.979 --> 36:29.853
I'm on the run.

36:29.981 --> 36:31.890
OK.

36:32.025 --> 36:34.730
I've got friends in Boise.

36:34.861 --> 36:37.696
I can't stay in the city.

36:37.822 --> 36:42.568
I'll be tested. I'll have to stay on my meds
and I won't do that.

36:42.702 --> 36:46.154
My eyes have been opened.
I mean, like you.

36:47.540 --> 36:51.123
I've seen death and I can't shut that off.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.328
I don't want to.

37:09.104 --> 37:13.600
- Did you, uh...?
- I don't... I can't really say.

37:16.861 --> 37:18.937
Everybody out!

37:19.072 --> 37:22.655
Everybody needs to get out
or you're all gonna die!

37:22.784 --> 37:25.405
You really shouldn't have done that.

37:28.456 --> 37:31.493
It's the Holy Ghost I'm worried about.

37:31.626 --> 37:36.371
You're not welcome in this church.
Peanut, you are trying my patience.

37:36.506 --> 37:39.044
- We have to warn them.
- Don't. Stop.

37:40.885 --> 37:43.174
Why wouldn't we?

37:44.848 --> 37:48.892
- You want this to happen?
- This has nothing to do with what I want.

37:49.019 --> 37:51.592
- But you're Death.
- No!

37:51.730 --> 37:54.221
This makes perfect sense.

37:54.357 --> 37:58.058
Death taking the form of a beautiful girl,
trying to trick me.

37:58.194 --> 38:02.239
I wasn't getting mushy
because he said I was beautiful.

38:02.365 --> 38:07.608
I'm not all that. I'm just a cog.
I sort of work for Death.

38:07.746 --> 38:10.912
Rube? He's Death?

38:11.041 --> 38:13.117
No. He's...

38:14.336 --> 38:16.873
.. middle management.

38:17.005 --> 38:21.334
But he knows about you, which means
upper management knows about you

38:21.468 --> 38:26.806
and, in this case,
upper management probably is Death.

38:27.432 --> 38:28.463
Oh.

38:28.600 --> 38:32.680
So you may have to run
farther than Idaho.

38:35.774 --> 38:38.561
You may now kiss the bride.

38:50.497 --> 38:54.364
I can't exactly tell you
why I needed to kiss him.

38:54.501 --> 38:58.035
I just knew I'd regret it if I hadn't.

38:58.171 --> 39:01.505
And then... I did my job.

39:06.888 --> 39:08.964
You should stay away from me.

39:39.045 --> 39:42.461
Did you do it? Good girl.

39:43.883 --> 39:47.584
You're not her doctor, are you?
You're not his patient.

39:48.722 --> 39:53.633
No. I'm not her doctor.
She's not my patient.

39:54.978 --> 39:59.474
I thought I saw Death coming for me.
I guess I was right.

40:22.088 --> 40:24.793
- They're not going to Bali, are they?
- No.

40:24.924 --> 40:28.091
That's one of the saddest things
I've ever heard.

40:28.219 --> 40:30.295
They don't seem to mind.

40:41.858 --> 40:44.942
You know, I really liked kissing you.

40:51.368 --> 40:55.033
In Ronnie's head,
maybe he thought he could fly

40:55.163 --> 40:58.034
or that I had some kind of special gift.

40:59.584 --> 41:02.289
I guess he was right.

41:02.420 --> 41:04.496
Maybe I do.

41:06.841 --> 41:12.049
We all create in our heads who we are
and who we want others to be.

41:15.266 --> 41:17.888
And how we view ourselves,

41:18.019 --> 41:21.020
hero, victim, loved, unloved,

41:21.147 --> 41:23.223
changes over time.

41:28.530 --> 41:32.527
Those little neurons spark along,
working overtime,

41:32.659 --> 41:35.232
creating what we believe.

41:41.543 --> 41:45.872
So in that way,
the mind kind of works like magic...

41:46.715 --> 41:49.632
.. making what we desire happen.

41:56.141 --> 42:02.345
And, in the end, maybe the trick
to sorting it all out is trusting your voice

42:02.480 --> 42:04.806
and being true to yourself,

42:04.941 --> 42:06.898
chasing your bliss.

42:15.118 --> 42:18.321
You know, all the clichés-on-parade crap

42:18.455 --> 42:21.372
like marching to the beat of your own...

42:22.751 --> 42:24.542
.. whatever.
