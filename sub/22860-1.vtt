06:12.606 --> 06:16.541
Naveen, when are you
gonna hook us up
with your boss?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.877
Everyone knows
you got the boss's ear.

06:18.879 --> 06:22.547
Richard Reid is
a busy man. I don't like
to waste his time.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.549
Waste his time?
What you talkin' about?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.785
Rough street records
needs a group
like si's finest...

06:26.787 --> 06:29.821
Hip-hop needs
a group like si's finest.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.156
We got somethin'
for everybody.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.791
A strong female rapper.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.793
Undeniable skills.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.528
You guys just won
five grand tonight.
What else do you need?

06:36.530 --> 06:38.029
A record deal. Duh.

06:38.031 --> 06:41.600
Look, you guys
have great potential.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.069
But I need
more than potential
to sell records.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.839
I need songs with structure,
hook, verse.

06:47.841 --> 06:50.041
I'm definitely not bringing
a bunch of battle rappers
in to my boss.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.777
Yo, you don't know
shit about music.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.945
Hangin' around in clubs
trying to scoop up groupies.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.881
Throwin' around
the a&r card.

06:55.883 --> 06:58.750
Yo, man, a&r to this guy
stands for ass
and romance, man.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.853
I'm done with
this conversation.
You guys enjoy your winnings.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.675
Hey, naveen.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.210
You guys aren't done
talking shit tonight?

07:26.712 --> 07:29.214
All I've ever wanted
was to be a rapper.

07:29.216 --> 07:33.185
<i> Rappers delight,</i>
<i> California love,</i>
<i> mind's playing tricks on me.</i>

07:33.187 --> 07:35.554
Those are the songs
people remember.

07:35.556 --> 07:38.223
I get it. That's what
you want from us.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.624
We can do that.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.861
Yeah? Well,
i haven't heard it.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.696
You're in a&r.
You're supposed
to see greatness

07:44.698 --> 07:46.231
before anyone else does.

07:46.233 --> 07:49.067
Anyone could
walk in here today
and discover Jay z.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.471
But it took someone special
to see greatness
in Shawn Carter.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.477
Let me think about it.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.679
Give me your info.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.191
Where's Malik?
Hey...

08:13.193 --> 08:14.960
I dunno. Yo! See Malik?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.094
Nah, man.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.262
Why not?

08:17.264 --> 08:18.730
I think Malik left.

08:20.600 --> 08:21.833
You good?

08:21.835 --> 08:24.102
Yeah. I ain't
trippin' over Malik.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.737
Mmm-hmm.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.939
Really. I just left
my hard drive in his crib.

08:31.677 --> 08:33.545
Come on. Don't start.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.247
Malik doesn't
owe me anything.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.749
And more importantly,
i don't owe him
anything either.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.518
You guys wear me out.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.653
Yo! Uber's here.
Who's coming?

08:41.655 --> 08:42.821
You coming?
I'm coming.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.623
Coco?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.758
You coming?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.660
I think i'ma hang around
a little bit longer.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.562
Okay.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.131
Bye.
Bye.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.679
I can't stand you.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.980
You ready to go?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.181
Get away from me.
Are you ready to go?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.583
Coco!

09:30.636 --> 09:33.271
We killed it last night.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.206
You had the audience
eatin' out ya hand.

09:45.718 --> 09:48.320
Yo, yo,
it's too hot for that, co.
Come on now.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.315
You out?

10:17.317 --> 10:19.851
I gotta work
the breakfast shift.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.153
Get me a number 6

10:22.155 --> 10:26.391
You wanna grub

and come get it, lazy.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.326
Yo, put some cheese

10:42.842 --> 10:44.175
You're late.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.779
Good morning, ma.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.314
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.318
How you ever gonna
find someone to love

10:53.320 --> 10:55.220
if you keep being
Malik's Booty call?

10:56.222 --> 10:57.288
Ma!

10:57.290 --> 10:58.890
Well?

10:58.892 --> 11:00.158
Who says
I'm looking for love?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.160
We all lookin'
for love, baby.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.828
Malik's always had my back.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.664
You remember how good
he was when dad died.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.265
What we have,
we don't need labels.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.367
Yeah? Well where I come from,
it's got a label.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.769
It's called "ho."

11:12.905 --> 11:16.041
I call it like I see it.

11:16.043 --> 11:19.678
What you lookin' at, huh?
This ain't no reality show.
Get back to work.

11:39.198 --> 11:40.932
These goddamn...

11:42.002 --> 11:44.969
Ooh... oh, my god.

11:44.971 --> 11:47.305
What happened?
You look like you
just won the lottery.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.441
It's naveen from
rough street records.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.344
"Good morning.
I thought about what you said

11:53.346 --> 11:55.213
"and I showed your stuff
to Richard last night.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.948
"He liked what he saw.
But he agrees with me

11:56.950 --> 11:59.084
"so here's the deal.
You have three months.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.219
"We have our labor day
weekend showcase
for new talent.

12:01.221 --> 12:05.390
"You send me three songs.
Richard and I like one,
you play it live."

12:05.392 --> 12:08.793
That is the ticket.
We're in.

12:08.795 --> 12:10.829
It sounds like
a whole lot of maybes to me.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.831
Well, you know these
music industry guys.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.165
They're just always
trying to play it cool.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.167
No, I don't know
these record label guys.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.770
All I know is that
he did not just
offer you a contract.

12:18.772 --> 12:21.906
And you know what?
Time's up, baby.
You gotta get back to school.

12:21.908 --> 12:25.310
Ma, can we just
not talk about school
for, like, five minutes?

12:25.312 --> 12:26.978
Coco, we had a deal.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.380
I need to focus on
this demo right now.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.850
I'll go back to school
in the fall, I promise.

12:31.852 --> 12:34.385
You were supposed to
be out one semester.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.488
Baby, it's been
almost a year.

12:36.490 --> 12:40.125
Baby, your father and I,
we have made
ridiculous sacrifices

12:40.127 --> 12:42.260
to make sure that
you got to college.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.196
Well, I'll pay you back
as soon as i
get a record deal.

12:45.198 --> 12:49.134
You wanna pay me back?
Graduate!

12:49.136 --> 12:53.538

You're almost done.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.407

12:56.409 --> 12:59.277
Just do it. It'll be
over before you know it.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.413
I can't be 30,
trying to start
my rap career, ma.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.850
Your not goin' back to school
is not an option with me.

13:05.852 --> 13:08.286
It is not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.

13:08.288 --> 13:12.824
You wanna rap?
Fine. But ya gonna have to
do it between classes.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.438
Yo, what the fuck?
What took so long?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.040

13:33.846 --> 13:35.013

13:35.015 --> 13:36.447
Coco,

13:36.449 --> 13:40.151
You smell like fuckin'
balls and underarms.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.452
You want
somethin' to eat?

13:41.454 --> 13:42.887
As if I would eat
something over here.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.889
Where's Malik?

13:44.891 --> 13:46.457
How we supposed to
know where Malik at?
Matt, you seen Malik?

13:46.459 --> 13:48.860
Nigga, do I look like

13:48.862 --> 13:50.328
Let me go upstairs
and get my bag.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.864
Uh...
What?

13:52.866 --> 13:54.833
You can't just be
goin' in Malik's room
when he not here.

13:54.835 --> 13:55.934
You can't do that.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.335
Since when?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.070
Go grab her!

13:59.072 --> 14:00.405

14:09.449 --> 14:11.182
Guess what.

another chance.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.920
For real?
Yes!

14:15.922 --> 14:18.022

17:58.111 --> 18:01.579
"got angry and kicked poetry."

18:03.683 --> 18:05.116
"I live poetry.

18:05.717 --> 18:08.820
"For I am poetry.

18:08.822 --> 18:13.157
"I do not write poetry.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.126
"Poetry writes me."

18:21.200 --> 18:25.470
Welcome to poetry 101.

18:25.472 --> 18:28.139
I am professor nefari Dixon.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.143
Thank you.

18:32.145 --> 18:35.613
For the next 12 weeks
we will be discussing

18:35.615 --> 18:39.183
the rhythmic
language of experience.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.420
Poetry.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.555
How many of you have
ever written a poem?

18:45.624 --> 18:47.158
Ah.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.728
How many of you
don't even like poetry?

18:52.265 --> 18:54.732
Well, let me give you
a word of warning.

18:56.668 --> 19:00.404
This class is not
for the faint of heart.

19:00.406 --> 19:05.510
You will explore
the limits of your abilities.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.379
You will find those limits

19:08.381 --> 19:10.748
and you will soar
past those limits.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.484
Remember this.

19:14.820 --> 19:20.391
Reading a book will
change what you know.

19:22.928 --> 19:25.463
Reading a poem will
change who you are.

19:30.402 --> 19:34.572
This is
my teaching assistant,
Mr. Derek Morris.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.408
He will run
the study services

19:37.410 --> 19:41.445
as well as be responsible
for the bulk of the grading.

19:42.748 --> 19:43.881
We are fully-booked.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.716
Who's that?
Sorry.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.351
Any students that
aren't registered
in this class

19:47.353 --> 19:49.387
will have to audition
in order to get a place.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.522
The audition
process is simple.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.424
Recite a poem from memory.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.194
No songs. Just poems.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.796
And I will decide
who stays

20:01.466 --> 20:03.467
and who goes.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.936
So, let's get into it.

20:04.938 --> 20:07.305
Who's first?

20:07.307 --> 20:10.741
"How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways."

20:10.743 --> 20:15.580
"If thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love

20:15.582 --> 20:19.483
"and I will no longer
be a capulet."

20:19.485 --> 20:22.820
"Once upon a midnight dreary

20:22.822 --> 20:27.592
"while I pondered
weak and weary." Hi.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.260
Thank you. Chris.

20:31.564 --> 20:32.897
Seat won't go down.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.835
"I pledge
allegiance to the flag..."

20:45.844 --> 20:48.746
And who do we have left?
Who do we have left?

20:52.618 --> 20:53.884
Floor's yours.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.625
"I start to think
and then I sink into the paper

21:00.627 --> 21:02.260
"like I was ink.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.996
"When I'm writin'
I'm trapped in
between the lines.

21:04.998 --> 21:08.399
"I escape when i
finish the rhymes."

21:08.401 --> 21:10.001
Yes!

21:16.508 --> 21:17.842
Rakim, right?

21:19.444 --> 21:21.045
Yeah.

21:21.047 --> 21:24.382
Well that's a rap.
So, I'm gonna
disqualify you.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.651
You said "no songs."
You didn't say
anything about "no raps."

21:26.653 --> 21:29.720
And I think you're
misunderstanding what
the audition process was.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.023
No, I understand what
you're saying. I get it.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.624
What you're
trying to say is that

21:33.626 --> 21:35.393
what some dead dudes
wrote 100 years ago

21:35.395 --> 21:37.762
is more important
than hip-hop is today.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.530
Ooh!

21:39.532 --> 21:40.965
I'm sorry,
what's your name again?

21:41.633 --> 21:43.401
Coco Ford.

21:43.403 --> 21:46.470
Well, I'm sorry, coco Ford,
but you're disqualified.

21:49.841 --> 21:50.941
That's wack.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.343
I'm out of here.

21:56.081 --> 22:00.084
It is not
an assumption that

22:00.086 --> 22:03.354
you need this class
to graduate.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.092
So I suggest
to all of you

22:08.094 --> 22:10.594
who are remaining

22:12.664 --> 22:13.964
to focus.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.769
How can they teach poetry
and leave out rap?

22:18.771 --> 22:20.905
Right?

22:20.907 --> 22:23.341
Where's the
English department?
This ain't right.

22:24.710 --> 22:25.976
Coco!

22:34.519 --> 22:35.686
Next.

22:47.499 --> 22:49.133
The rakim fan.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.701
Have a seat.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.705
A little before
your time, no?

22:54.707 --> 22:56.907
My pops got me open
on rakim.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.043
It's the first rap
i knew by heart.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.579
Oh, you're one of
those, huh?

23:01.581 --> 23:05.015
You think that rap
and poetry are the same.

23:05.017 --> 23:06.817
Yeah.

23:07.786 --> 23:10.521
I grew up on hip-hop, okay?

23:10.523 --> 23:15.626
I was
the shorty running around
all the block parties.

23:15.628 --> 23:19.096
I've forgotten
more about hip-hop
than you will ever know.

23:19.098 --> 23:23.768
And I've watched it
become misogynistic

23:23.770 --> 23:28.906
and small-minded
and uninspiring.

23:28.908 --> 23:32.510
Not all hip-hop
is misogynistic
and small-minded.

23:32.512 --> 23:35.179
Oh. You're talking
about conscious rap.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.848
But no one
listens to it.

23:37.850 --> 23:41.685
They don't play it
on the radio.
And no one buys it.

23:41.687 --> 23:45.022
So you're just
gonna turn your back
on the whole culture?

23:45.024 --> 23:49.927
Oh,
with fantastic lyrics like

23:49.929 --> 23:53.464
"i woke up in the morning
and the girls
were still there."

23:53.466 --> 23:55.900
"They were naked with
their asses in the air"

23:55.902 --> 23:58.669
and, I don't know,
some canonical work

23:58.671 --> 24:01.439
by lfmao or
whatever their names are.

24:01.441 --> 24:05.543
Professor, you and your ta,
Mr. Morris

24:05.545 --> 24:08.546
are in a position
to inspire people
to do better.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.448
You have
a platform and a voice.

24:10.450 --> 24:13.551
I'm not turning
my back on hip-hop.

24:13.553 --> 24:16.454
Hip-hop has already
turned its back on us.

24:17.489 --> 24:20.658
I'm sorry, class is full.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.959
None of this sounds like us.

24:54.961 --> 24:58.562
That's the point.
We're supposed to
make a hit.

24:58.564 --> 25:00.197
But it don't
sound like a hit.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.601
Yo, man,
reasons makes better
beats than this shit.

25:03.603 --> 25:06.036
Thank you, man.
Matt, come on.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.538
Seriously,
you guys, we don't have

25:07.540 --> 25:09.540
that much time to
get this together.

25:09.542 --> 25:12.710
We need to come hard,
all right.
Like east coast style, son.

25:12.712 --> 25:15.679
Coming hard is why
we're still recording
in this dingy-ass basement.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.748
Yo, whatever, man.

25:17.750 --> 25:21.719
I mean, for real.
We are not gangstas.

25:21.721 --> 25:25.022
We have never been to jail.
And we ain't got no guns.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.924
Coco, I got guns.
Where?

25:37.803 --> 25:40.237
That's it.
Let's drop that.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.106
No, that's the shit
I'm talkin' about.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.041
Let me know when
you guys are done.
I'm takin' a nap.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.010
Get that "I'll be sure" line
and all that.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.177
Especially, get that one.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.879
You good?
Yeah, yeah.

25:55.186 --> 25:57.054
Watch your feet.
You know you're wrong.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.989
Co, can you forget
about shorty?

26:05.931 --> 26:07.598
Let me get some.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.135
You ain't gonna
give me none?
Have one.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.876
Why are you so worked up?
Hmm?

26:21.913 --> 26:23.647
You wound up way too tight.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.354
Feel good, right?

26:30.356 --> 26:31.789
It feels okay.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.624
You know it feels good.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.929
Yeah, co, we gonna get it.
All right?

26:40.799 --> 26:42.166
We gonna get it.

26:47.072 --> 26:48.372
We gonna get it.

26:52.377 --> 26:54.311
Guess who's blowin'
you up on Twitter.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.316
Derek Morris at
derekinspace writes,

26:59.318 --> 27:02.019
"students, next time
you can't get your way

27:02.021 --> 27:04.989
"don't go
running to the teacher.
#freshmanfail."

27:04.991 --> 27:07.091
That's not me.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.626
Girl, you know it is.

27:09.861 --> 27:12.096
What's his handle?

27:12.098 --> 27:15.299
They can keep me
out of class, but they
can't keep me off Twitter.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.034
You gotta turn
everything into a battle?

27:31.916 --> 27:33.884
Check this out.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.286
That little hip-hop diva
is putting you on blast.

27:51.202 --> 27:53.070
Let her in.

27:55.740 --> 27:58.308
The iambic pentameter

27:58.310 --> 28:02.846
is the most common way
of writing poetry.

28:02.848 --> 28:04.682
Can you repeat that?

28:04.684 --> 28:07.051
Iambic pentameter.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.019
I want you to know this.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.755
I want you to take her home,
ride her all night
if you will.

28:11.757 --> 28:14.758
But please,
do not marry the bitch.

28:16.729 --> 28:20.230
Well, this week's
assignment was for you
to write something

28:20.232 --> 28:21.932
that scares you.

28:21.934 --> 28:24.001
Who's willing to share
what they've written?

28:25.070 --> 28:28.005
Let's see. Coco Ford?

28:29.908 --> 28:32.076
You only let me
in class today.

28:32.078 --> 28:34.144
I'm aware of that.

28:34.146 --> 28:38.048
But you are responsible
for your assignments.

28:38.050 --> 28:42.052
You did receive the email
with your assignment
and the reading?

28:42.054 --> 28:44.188
Yes?

28:44.190 --> 28:46.857
I did the reading.
I just didn't have time
to finish the assignment.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.892
I only had a few hours.

28:48.894 --> 28:49.960
Oh.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.831
Try to keep up.

28:53.833 --> 28:57.201
As part of your curriculum,
you are expected to attend

28:57.203 --> 29:03.040
at least one of Mr. Morris'
weekly slam poetry
field trips.

29:04.375 --> 29:07.144
Mr. Morris,
where is it this week?

29:07.146 --> 29:10.948
This week,
guys, we're gonna be heading
to the nuyorican poetry slam.

29:14.853 --> 29:18.055
<i> Welcome to the house</i>
<i> Miguel algarin built.</i>

29:19.859 --> 29:25.362
<i> A mix of nuyorican soul</i>
<i> and neighborhood hustle.</i>

29:25.364 --> 29:28.132
Here, you can learn
your love's truest name

29:28.134 --> 29:31.101
and claim
the reign to victory.

29:31.103 --> 29:35.939
Here, you get to be
whoever you want to be.
And more.

29:38.343 --> 29:43.947
Welcome to the house
of smooth lyrics
and slam poetry.

29:45.216 --> 29:48.519
Slick talk
and real heartbeats.

29:50.021 --> 29:53.056
Here time stands still.

29:59.564 --> 30:03.300
The vibe tonight,
we takin' it higher
than we ever been.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.838
Our first poet,
Adam falkner.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.951
I can't believe
all these people
are here for poetry.

30:22.988 --> 30:26.290
The whitest thing.
Owning your own white guilt
isn't cool yet.

30:26.292 --> 30:29.493
Listen, I'd like
to introduce two
of my new students.

30:29.495 --> 30:30.594
This is coco.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.563
Hi.
Hey. How you doin'?

30:32.565 --> 30:34.431
I'm well, thank you.
Nice to meet you.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.099
And this is Julie.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.568
- How you doin', Julie?
- Hi.

30:37.570 --> 30:40.237
This right here, guys,
is the man. Coltrane.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.606
He's a pillar
of New York's
poetry community.

30:42.608 --> 30:45.943
And he knows
professor Dixon pretty well.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.978
Has she made your
life miserable, yet?

30:49.081 --> 30:50.981
I see you know her
very well.

30:50.983 --> 30:54.451
Yes, very, very well.
She's my wife.

30:54.453 --> 30:57.354
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

30:57.356 --> 31:01.458
Of all the street
compliments I get
walking down the street

31:01.460 --> 31:04.628
"ga gless you, ma"
is my favorite.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.163
So what's your thing?

31:06.165 --> 31:08.565
She's a rapper that
doesn't like poetry.

31:08.567 --> 31:09.967
Oh, come on.

31:09.969 --> 31:13.036
Perfect. Perfect, coco.

31:13.038 --> 31:16.173
Because you're
gonna be a judge.

31:17.075 --> 31:19.243
No.
Yes.

31:19.245 --> 31:23.046
You can do it, you can do it.
Don't worry about it.
You got taste?

31:23.048 --> 31:24.114
Mmm.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.916
All right, great.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.285
Clip the keratin armor
until your nails are slick.

31:28.287 --> 31:30.654
Keep each operation uniform.
Rank, file, top, sides.

31:30.656 --> 31:33.557
Push back the enemy cuticles
with oil and lotion.

31:33.559 --> 31:36.994
The chemical arsenal
of a vietnamese
manicurist named chien.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.662
A name that means "war."

31:38.664 --> 31:41.665
Even oceans away,
she carries
the war like a name.

31:41.667 --> 31:44.301
She's bent over,
scrubbing your fingers.

31:44.303 --> 31:47.404
The cuticle foliage remind her

31:47.406 --> 31:51.074
of slaughtered soldiers,
her dead father,
her sister buried alive.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.510
"Tell me what color
you like."

31:53.512 --> 31:55.612
Judges,
let me see those scorecards.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.314
We got an 8.5.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.650
A 9.5.

32:01.519 --> 32:03.420
I see a 10 over there.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.361
We got a 7 right here.

32:17.035 --> 32:19.536
Uh, okay.
Damn!

32:19.538 --> 32:21.305
People take this seriously.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.307
Now perhaps I should
start this poem

32:23.309 --> 32:26.243
by informing you
that I am bilingual.

32:26.245 --> 32:30.113
That the queen's English
that I speak so eloquently
before you now

32:30.115 --> 32:32.115
is not my
first language, no.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.051
My grandmother
never used such diction

32:34.053 --> 32:37.454
when she spoke me up
in the welfare line
amongst the other dwellers.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.991
Or when she called down to me
from the project
window for dinner, no.

32:40.993 --> 32:43.193
We spoke a more
Southern-fried English.

32:45.564 --> 32:49.132
I am a be-hyphen-ginner
and my moves shall
remain inadequate

32:49.134 --> 32:52.336
until these hands
can rip the skull
from out of my lips

32:52.338 --> 32:55.072
and hand deliver
you perfection.

32:55.074 --> 32:58.675
Brown body
collapses like cardboard
across the dance floor.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.377
Sarcophagus unlocked.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.613
Blades reveal,
blades reveal these bones.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.749
My Swiss army skeleton.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.251
Skull, flathead screwdriver,
finger bone,
switch shoulder, switchblade

33:08.253 --> 33:10.320
switch rib cage
keys cords cage.

33:10.322 --> 33:14.491
The b-boy's spinal cord
is key to pandora's
cardboard boom box.

33:14.493 --> 33:18.362
Click and rewind. Click.

33:18.364 --> 33:21.331
They scared o' you,
black boy.

33:21.333 --> 33:25.235
Do you see how they shiver
when you speak, young man?

33:25.237 --> 33:28.505
How they speed up
when you walk behind them
in your crown.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.675
When you become a king
and point your notebooks
at their temples.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.411
When you rob them
of their knowledge.

33:34.413 --> 33:37.481
When you carry your backpack
more than your basketball

33:37.483 --> 33:39.349
and pull your jeans
up off your boxers.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.451
When you put down your gloves
and stop fighting.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.253
When you pick up your gloves
and keep fighting.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.522
When you put
a rod in your spine

33:45.524 --> 33:47.257
and proclaim
you ain't ready to die.

33:47.259 --> 33:50.160
Take your place
as the chosen people.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.397
We have a 9.6.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.165
And we got an 8.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.535
We got a 10.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.174
I want y'all to give it up
for Derek Morris, y'all.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.643
Um...

34:06.645 --> 34:09.212
Sounds of
apologetic hearts breaking

34:09.214 --> 34:12.416
have been my life's anthem
since I was 16 years old.

34:12.418 --> 34:16.753
Cultivating the platform
for this now 21 year old
monument of a man

34:17.789 --> 34:20.157
who's afraid of commitment.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.825
I saw it first
in my father.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.794
When I realized
that he was afraid

34:23.796 --> 34:25.829
of heights midair
of jumping the broom.

34:25.831 --> 34:29.166
Attracted to women
quick to tie knots
like boy scouts.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.535
While simultaneously
making ones in the womb.

34:31.537 --> 34:34.438
These were wavering women.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.373
Willing to
compromise their morals

34:36.375 --> 34:38.775
for the maintenance of morale.

34:38.777 --> 34:43.613
Wailing women who viewed
my father's infidelity
like a crucifixion.

34:44.715 --> 34:47.084
I wonder how god felt

34:47.086 --> 34:51.354
when he saw his own son die
due to a flaw
within his own system.

34:51.356 --> 34:53.824
Or how my father feels

34:53.826 --> 34:56.560
when he sees his own son
strive to be nothing like him

34:56.562 --> 34:58.795
so therefore
resembles his victims.

35:03.668 --> 35:07.871
Do either of them
live vicariously
through their children?

35:07.873 --> 35:11.541
Or look away as they
go through hell and back.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.111
Thank you.

35:15.380 --> 35:18.648
Loved the poem,
hated his delivery.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.784
Are we havin' fun
here tonight or what?

35:27.325 --> 35:29.259
All right,
i wanna see some scores.

35:29.694 --> 35:31.328
8.2.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.299
We got a 9.5.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.135
We got a 9.

35:39.237 --> 35:41.171
And we got a 6.5.

35:43.375 --> 35:44.774
She took him out.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.343
Oh, damn.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.248
Remember,
for the next two months

35:51.250 --> 35:53.250
the winners of
each weekly slam

35:53.252 --> 35:56.853
will compete for a spot
on my 5 boros slam team.

35:56.855 --> 36:00.524
Representing New York City
on labor day weekend

36:00.526 --> 36:02.459
in the national competition.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.729
He didn't mention
anything about that.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.366
And tonight we have
our first finalist.

36:09.368 --> 36:12.435
The winner of
this weekly slam.

36:12.437 --> 36:15.805
I want y'all to give it up
for Vanessa hidary.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.242
Peace, y'all.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.485
Derek.

36:32.223 --> 36:36.293
Hey. I just wanted to say
that your poems
are really good.

36:36.295 --> 36:38.962
So, what,
you gave me low scores
just to mess with me?

36:38.964 --> 36:40.697
No, not at all, I just...

36:40.699 --> 36:44.501
Listen,
this may be a joke to you

36:44.503 --> 36:46.836
but that 5 boros slam team
is important to me.

36:48.439 --> 36:50.707
I just think
your performance
could have been better.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.646
And you know this
because you get up on a stage

36:56.648 --> 37:00.750
and say whatever shit
comes into your mind
and think that's poetry.

37:02.788 --> 37:05.522
You know what?
Save your constructive
bullshit for your homies.

37:06.257 --> 37:07.791
Goodnight.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.326
My homies?

37:12.396 --> 37:14.264
I told ya
you could be a good judge.

37:14.266 --> 37:17.334
But damn,
his students usually
give him a good score.

38:05.650 --> 38:09.019
Very nice,
miss Ford, very nice.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.453
Thank you.

38:10.455 --> 38:14.524
You've got
the voice and the snaps.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.893
A real crowd pleaser.

38:16.895 --> 38:20.497
But is that really
all you have to say?

38:21.832 --> 38:25.402
Really, Mr. Morris,
what was that?

38:26.337 --> 38:28.772
That was a rap.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.507
This nigga.

38:30.509 --> 38:33.543
Precisely.

38:33.545 --> 38:38.615
Miss Ford, please,
care enough to
learn the difference.

38:49.894 --> 38:53.363
It's poetry, not rap.
Poetry, not rap.

38:55.734 --> 38:58.001
Whatever.

39:24.662 --> 39:27.364
Miss Ford, I like the rap.

39:27.366 --> 39:30.767
But I liked it better
when mos def did it
10 years ago.

39:30.769 --> 39:35.405
We are going to keep this up
until you write a poem.

39:35.407 --> 39:37.474
If everybody else
in here can get that,

39:37.476 --> 39:39.809
I don't understand
why you can't.

39:39.811 --> 39:43.680
What is wrong with you?
What is your problem?

39:43.682 --> 39:46.116
Children, please, understand,

39:46.118 --> 39:49.619
this university
already has your money.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.956
I already have your money.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.992
You may as well
learn something.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.130
Dixon's not here.

40:00.132 --> 40:01.564
I came to see you.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.535
I'm looking for some advice.

40:05.537 --> 40:07.470
Yeah, well, my advice to you,

40:07.472 --> 40:10.740
if you don't
respect the curriculum,
drop the class.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.710
I wasn't trying to
be disrespectful.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.578
Poetry is just
harder than I thought.

40:16.781 --> 40:18.748
But I'm gonna get it.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.051
Oh, well, thank you so,
so much for sharing
that with us.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.862
Do you know
what Dixon meant
when she said

40:32.864 --> 40:35.765
I need to learn
the difference between
a rap and a poem?

40:35.767 --> 40:38.668
I mean,
i thought I knew,

40:38.670 --> 40:42.205
but I obviously don't.

40:42.207 --> 40:47.877
Look, rap,
when you break it down,
is 95% bragging and boasting.

40:47.879 --> 40:51.514
Poetry is more about truth
and introspection.

40:51.516 --> 40:54.083
Nas, biggie,
Kendrick Lamar,

40:54.085 --> 40:56.719
plenty of rappers
are truthful
and introspective.

40:56.721 --> 40:58.455
And that's exactly
why they stand out.

40:58.457 --> 41:00.857
Put some real emotion
into it.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.158
Tell me how you really feel.

41:03.627 --> 41:07.163
My feelings. Right.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.699
'Cause that's what
niggas is tryin' to hear
at the strip club?

41:09.701 --> 41:11.234
My feelings?

41:11.236 --> 41:13.503
I should burst into tears
in the middle of a battle.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.238
Then maybe
I'll sell lots of records.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.507
You're never
gonna sell any records

41:17.509 --> 41:20.877
if you don't start
putting more of yourself
into your music. Okay?

41:20.879 --> 41:24.681
So buy a journal and
a separate rhyme book.
Make sure you keep your notes.

41:24.683 --> 41:28.485
You know what?
I'm good. Never mind.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.790
Oh, so you're mad now?

41:34.725 --> 41:37.560
Good. Use it.

41:37.562 --> 41:39.496
Don't push it away.

41:39.498 --> 41:42.866
I'm not mad.
You can't make me mad.

41:42.868 --> 41:46.269
Okay then. So, whatever
this not mad thing
you got going on,

41:46.271 --> 41:48.037
write about it.

41:48.039 --> 41:51.140
You should feel pain
when you write.

41:51.142 --> 41:54.577
Listen coco, if your art
doesn't make you
feel uncomfortable

41:54.579 --> 41:57.947
then you're not
going deep enough.
And that's plain and simple.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.582
You really believe
that shit?

42:00.618 --> 42:03.219
I live that. Okay?

42:08.092 --> 42:10.293
Mmm. I don't
work like that.

42:10.295 --> 42:12.262
Rap is what I escape to.

42:12.264 --> 42:13.963
Well,

42:17.034 --> 42:19.969
that's your problem.

42:19.971 --> 42:22.939
And that's the difference
between a rap and a poem.

43:07.151 --> 43:09.085
Sea, water, body.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.254
Moonlight.

43:11.256 --> 43:14.223
Fresh fish flakes
in my mouth.

43:14.225 --> 43:17.694
Love's words
match love's touch.

43:17.696 --> 43:20.897
How to forget me
and do you.

43:23.968 --> 43:25.602
Let's go, sweetheart.

43:25.604 --> 43:28.071
You can't relate
to what I'm sayin'.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.006
Everybody leave.

43:30.008 --> 43:32.041
Coco got big dreams.

43:32.043 --> 43:34.243
God, hear me, please.

43:56.967 --> 43:58.735
Thanks for
meeting me here.

44:04.008 --> 44:05.241
Okay...

44:09.213 --> 44:12.181
Look, it doesn't
have to rhyme, you know.

44:12.183 --> 44:14.784
Like, rhyming over a beat
is cool and things,

44:14.786 --> 44:18.421
but you've gotta
be really careful
with spoken word poetry.

44:18.423 --> 44:21.758
It can sound
a little bit cheesy.
Like Dr. Seuss.

44:21.760 --> 44:24.761
And distracting you
from what you're
really trying to say.

44:27.064 --> 44:28.331
You just need to
dig deeper.

44:32.269 --> 44:35.905
Okay, let's try something.
Yeah?

44:35.907 --> 44:38.975
Look out the window
and tell me what you see.

44:45.115 --> 44:46.382
I see
the doo-doo brown river.

44:47.184 --> 44:48.785
And some...

44:48.787 --> 44:50.319
Rusty old bridge.

44:50.321 --> 44:52.188
Some dirty projects.

44:52.190 --> 44:56.459
And some big houses
with a bunch of rich people
living in them.

44:56.461 --> 44:59.395
You're looking,
but you're not seeing.

45:02.366 --> 45:05.735
When I look out that window,
i don't see a dirty
doo-doo brown river.

45:06.704 --> 45:09.472
I see the agent of the sea.

45:09.474 --> 45:10.940
That brings life with it.

45:10.942 --> 45:12.975
That separates two worlds.

45:12.977 --> 45:14.277
And that bridge?

45:14.279 --> 45:16.245
That bridge is
the portal between them.

45:16.247 --> 45:19.382
Where it allows people
to grow and come
together and learn.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.850
And this,
where we are right now,

45:20.852 --> 45:23.219
this institution
houses great minds.

45:23.221 --> 45:25.722
Scientists, lawyers,
professors, philanthropists,

45:25.724 --> 45:27.957
and yes, poets.

45:27.959 --> 45:30.059
This is where
rappers come to die.

45:30.961 --> 45:33.096
So when I look at you...

45:33.098 --> 45:37.500
I see a girl who is afraid
to Pierce that veil
on a calculated cool.

45:37.502 --> 45:40.236
What's inside
might hurt her.

45:40.238 --> 45:43.973
When you can go deep enough
inside yourself
your work will be incredible.

45:46.243 --> 45:48.044
And you know what
the best part of it all is?

45:49.980 --> 45:51.180
It doesn't have to rhyme.

46:10.267 --> 46:11.968
"Pick a topic
you believe in.

46:11.970 --> 46:13.336
"Something you're
passionate about..."

46:43.333 --> 46:45.835
Miss coco Ford,
what do you have for us?

47:03.387 --> 47:06.556
"Displacement of
low income residents.

47:06.558 --> 47:10.193
"The poor folk,
the lower class,
the impoverished.

47:10.195 --> 47:12.595
"The blacks and the browns.

47:12.597 --> 47:16.065
"We used to scare 'em.
They used to
think us dangerous.

47:16.067 --> 47:19.335
"Dropped heads, averted gazes.
Clutched bags.

47:19.337 --> 47:22.939
"Walks quicken to a sprint
when we walk past.

47:22.941 --> 47:24.440
"Or they saw us
on the corner,

47:24.442 --> 47:27.543
"god forbid we met eyes
or brushed shoulders.

47:27.545 --> 47:29.178
"Before there
was williamsburg,

47:29.180 --> 47:31.214
"it was the south side
and the north side.

47:31.216 --> 47:34.317
"Before there was
east williamsburg,
it was bushwick.

47:34.319 --> 47:36.219
"Places they
never even thought of
walking through

47:36.221 --> 47:39.155
"before there were
white folk there.

47:39.157 --> 47:41.123
"There were no trash cans
on our street corners.

47:41.125 --> 47:43.326
"No yellow taxis
driving through.

47:43.328 --> 47:45.361
"No bike racks
and no dog parks.

47:45.363 --> 47:48.497
"Even though
we've always had bikes
and we always had dogs.

47:48.499 --> 47:53.269
"And even though we some days
get tired too, we had
no benches to rest on."

48:02.646 --> 48:04.313
Mmm-hmm.

48:09.186 --> 48:10.620
I'm amazed
how amazing that was.

48:13.257 --> 48:15.224
Well, check you out.

48:15.226 --> 48:16.459
You nailed it.

48:17.461 --> 48:19.028
Really?

48:19.030 --> 48:21.664
'Cause all I heard
was, "mmm-hmm."

48:21.666 --> 48:24.533
You kidding me?
That was
the ultimate compliment.

48:24.535 --> 48:26.936
She was digesting it.
You made her think and feel.

48:26.938 --> 48:28.271
Excuse me.

48:30.274 --> 48:32.909
Well, then,
i guess you broke me down.

48:32.911 --> 48:33.976
You know what?

48:35.913 --> 48:38.281
Why don't we go out
and celebrate or something?

48:38.283 --> 48:39.682
Nothin' crazy, just...

48:41.151 --> 48:42.218
A bit of food.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.354
I got somethin' we can do.

48:45.356 --> 48:47.290
Check out
a little bit of my world.

48:47.292 --> 48:49.025
And what does
that mean exactly?

48:49.027 --> 48:51.994
Drop down to
killah hill 10304.

48:51.996 --> 48:54.030
What you know
about killah hill?

48:54.032 --> 48:55.264
Come on.

52:01.751 --> 52:04.520
Now, get ready for
some real hip-hop.

52:41.525 --> 52:43.359
This place
is something else.

52:43.361 --> 52:45.494
They call it the gym.

52:45.496 --> 52:47.763
Whenever I need a workout,
i come out here and
soak up all the flows.

52:49.266 --> 52:52.268
Then afterwards,
we come up here and drink.

52:52.270 --> 52:53.936
Do you drink?

52:53.938 --> 52:55.571
Tip a glass or two.

53:07.785 --> 53:09.518
Peace, peace, kid.

53:09.520 --> 53:10.819
What's your name, man?

53:10.821 --> 53:12.254
I'm Derek, bro.

53:12.256 --> 53:14.790
Oh, Drake,
nice to meet you, bro.

53:14.792 --> 53:16.559
Where you from,
Derek?

53:16.561 --> 53:18.460
Just outside London.

53:18.462 --> 53:21.430
That explains
why dude sounds like
Harry Potter. Right?

53:22.633 --> 53:26.402
So, I mean
what you into, Derek?

53:26.404 --> 53:28.871
Uh... I'd like
to be a poet.

53:30.907 --> 53:32.975
Nah, I mean, it...

53:32.977 --> 53:34.410
Did I say
something funny or...

53:34.412 --> 53:35.878
Real fuckin'
funny, man.

53:35.880 --> 53:38.914
I thought most rappers
consider themselves poets.

53:38.916 --> 53:41.917
Nah, we rap and shit.
We ain't with
that poetry, y'all.

53:44.588 --> 53:46.488
You're a funny dude.

53:47.958 --> 53:50.292
What the fuck was that?

53:50.294 --> 53:53.796
Man, yo, son,
you know what, son?
Definitely drew his beard in.

53:53.798 --> 53:55.331
He drew that shit in.

53:55.333 --> 53:56.699
He painted that shit on.
I don't like it.

53:58.301 --> 53:59.602
Here we go,
here we go.

54:15.652 --> 54:18.254
I think I can do that.

54:18.256 --> 54:20.022
Yo, co, co,
you ready to go?

54:20.024 --> 54:21.590
Listen, mate,
she's with me.

54:21.592 --> 54:23.559
This your new man?

54:24.361 --> 54:25.995
He's a friend.

54:25.997 --> 54:29.632
Friend?
Yeah good, good, good.
We all need friends.

54:29.634 --> 54:31.967
Even poets.

54:31.969 --> 54:33.702
Come on,
we got work to catch up on,
let's go.

54:33.704 --> 54:35.304
Listen, take your hands
off her, bro.

54:35.805 --> 54:37.673
Oh.

54:37.675 --> 54:39.408
Yeah.
Chill out, Malik.

54:39.410 --> 54:41.310
I'll see you tomorrow.

54:41.312 --> 54:43.412
That's a real good idea,
I'll see you tomorrow.

54:43.414 --> 54:44.613
Right.
Gosh.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.720
Look at you.

54:55.492 --> 54:56.892
I got somewhere
i wanna take you.

55:06.736 --> 55:09.471
Back up off me, nigga.
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

55:09.473 --> 55:10.673
You better
watch yourself, son.

55:10.675 --> 55:12.041
What the fuck
are you gonna do?

55:12.043 --> 55:13.442
What you gonna do, huh?
Chill out, all right?

55:13.444 --> 55:14.677
Chill.
What, man, what?

55:14.679 --> 55:15.911
What, what, what?

55:15.913 --> 55:17.313
What, what, what?

55:19.416 --> 55:21.550
What you doin' up
on the rock, Derek?
Hey.

55:21.552 --> 55:23.085
I just am out here...
Yeah?

55:23.087 --> 55:25.487
Coco, this here's
my boy aj and Hassan.
'Sup?

55:25.489 --> 55:27.089
They were in
my class last year.
Are you good?

55:27.091 --> 55:29.091
I'm good, bro,
I'm good, I'm good.
You good?

55:29.093 --> 55:31.360
See you again. All right.
Take it easy.

55:35.065 --> 55:36.965
Was you worried
about me then?

55:36.967 --> 55:38.467
How adorable.

55:38.469 --> 55:40.836
No. I was about to
jump in for you.

55:40.838 --> 55:42.638
Have to save your light skin.

55:44.741 --> 55:47.042
I am Brooklyn, sometimes.

55:47.044 --> 55:50.512
And she is queen.

55:50.514 --> 55:54.583
And we, we're separated by
the cemetery of
sentimentality.

55:56.554 --> 55:59.655
Totally I would
take on a relation,
she gets ill with us.

55:59.657 --> 56:02.624
The thrill with us
is the break up to make up.

56:02.626 --> 56:05.994
Two together define,
yet unrefined and pure.

56:05.996 --> 56:10.032
So, when I'm at her crib,
i leave my timberlands
at the door.

56:10.034 --> 56:13.802
Mint tea and a spliff
and let's hold each other
on the couch.

56:13.804 --> 56:17.373
Tellin' each other
that without, without
knowledge of self,

56:17.375 --> 56:19.141
knowledge is nothing.

56:21.111 --> 56:23.879
I'm Brooklyn, sometimes.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.681
And she is queen.

56:26.583 --> 56:29.485
And she reads a book to me

56:29.487 --> 56:32.388
about a man's invisibility.
Yes, about
a man's invisibility.

56:32.390 --> 56:36.892
But to her I am visible
and perceived with vision.

56:36.894 --> 56:39.161
You are full of
so many surprises.

56:42.499 --> 56:44.700
What are you looking at?

56:44.702 --> 56:46.502
You.

56:46.504 --> 56:48.504
You're freaking me out.

56:48.506 --> 56:50.005
I look that bad?

56:50.007 --> 56:52.875
You know, actually,
you don't look half bad.

56:52.877 --> 56:56.145
It's nothing a little
plastic surgery can't fix.

56:56.147 --> 56:58.981
No, really,
i know a good surgeon.
Mmm.

57:01.485 --> 57:05.020
Well, there's not one thing
I'd change about you.

57:05.022 --> 57:06.655
Unless, maybe I could
get like some

57:06.657 --> 57:08.724
brain surgery to,
like, get it taken out.

57:08.726 --> 57:10.659
Shut up.

57:10.661 --> 57:13.162
You must have been
a real brat
when you was a kid.

57:13.164 --> 57:15.464
I was shy. Very shy.

57:15.466 --> 57:17.933
Yeah, okay, and I was
the prince of wales.

57:17.935 --> 57:21.570
No, really.
I was a runt
when I was a little kid.

57:21.572 --> 57:24.540
And I got picked on a lot.

57:26.476 --> 57:28.010
My dad was my only friend.

57:29.846 --> 57:32.548
And I remember,
we'd have these
little rap battles

57:32.550 --> 57:36.084
and my favorite line
of his was

57:36.086 --> 57:38.954
"I'm the twinkle in your eye,
the tear in your cry,

57:38.956 --> 57:40.556
"the reason for your why.

57:40.558 --> 57:42.157
"So seek me.

57:42.159 --> 57:44.960
"As you learn to
love yourself better,
teach me."

57:44.962 --> 57:47.062
And I remember when
he would say that,

57:47.064 --> 57:50.799
I would just feel like
the most invincible
little kid in the world.

57:52.902 --> 57:55.537
But then he died.

57:55.539 --> 57:59.107
And Malik sort of took over
as my rap partner.

57:59.109 --> 58:02.678
Malik and those fools
have been
the only men in my life.

58:06.649 --> 58:07.716
Until now.

58:11.254 --> 58:13.522
Thank you.
For inviting me tonight.

58:15.258 --> 58:17.659
Thank you for
teaching me poetry.

59:36.306 --> 59:39.074
I had to
get out of there.

59:40.244 --> 59:43.145
Was it good?

59:43.147 --> 59:44.346
I can't explain it.

59:45.014 --> 59:46.949
He was so...

59:48.585 --> 59:49.751
Open.

59:49.753 --> 59:51.219
That kind of
freaked me out.

59:51.221 --> 59:54.222
You're just used to being
ignored and neglected.

59:54.224 --> 59:56.725
I like him for you.
You don't like him?

59:57.961 --> 59:59.962
Suppose he is
the love of your life.

59:59.964 --> 1:00:03.031
But how will you know
if you keep pushing him away?

1:00:03.033 --> 1:00:05.701
Well, if he's the love
of my life,

1:00:05.703 --> 1:00:07.035
then I don't
have to do anything.

1:00:07.037 --> 1:00:08.870
It'll happen, right?

1:00:08.872 --> 1:00:11.373
Speak of the devil.
I'm out of here.

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:24.386
Now look,
i really don't want things
to be weird in class.

1:00:24.388 --> 1:00:28.690
So can we just pretend
nothing happened?

1:00:28.692 --> 1:00:29.825
Yeah?

1:00:32.128 --> 1:00:33.295
Okay.
Cool.

1:00:35.865 --> 1:00:36.932
Cool.

1:00:38.267 --> 1:00:39.401
Cool.

1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:12.367
It still needs to
be mixed properly.
No.

1:01:12.369 --> 1:01:14.903
Mixing won't make
the lyrics better.

1:01:14.905 --> 1:01:17.239
And the song structure sucks.

1:01:17.241 --> 1:01:18.940
We gotta dig
deeper than this.

1:01:18.942 --> 1:01:20.909
Let's just send it to naveen
and see what he says.

1:01:20.911 --> 1:01:22.444
We can't send this to naveen.

1:01:22.446 --> 1:01:24.980
We have one shot
with his ear.

1:01:24.982 --> 1:01:26.882
We don't wanna
fuck that up.

1:01:26.884 --> 1:01:28.817
So, we're just gonna
keep working
until we get it right.

1:01:28.819 --> 1:01:30.452
I'm done with
this demo shit.

1:01:30.454 --> 1:01:32.788
All right,
we damn near broke.

1:01:32.790 --> 1:01:35.724
We ain't battled in a month.
We ain't no snap
crackle pop-ass rappers.

1:01:35.726 --> 1:01:38.093
We ain't
no fuckin' sellouts.

1:01:38.095 --> 1:01:40.328
We need to stick to battles.
That's what we do.

1:01:40.330 --> 1:01:42.264
No, that's what you do.

1:01:42.266 --> 1:01:44.066
We are a group.

1:01:44.068 --> 1:01:45.767
And we made a commitment
to finish this demo,

1:01:45.769 --> 1:01:48.804
so that's what
we're gonna do.

1:01:48.806 --> 1:01:50.806
Reasons,
play the beat, please.

1:01:50.808 --> 1:01:52.240
Nah, nah, reason,
don't play shit.

1:01:52.242 --> 1:01:53.809
Don't play a motherfuckin'
thing, all right?

1:01:53.811 --> 1:01:55.877
Coco, you don't
run shit around here.

1:01:55.879 --> 1:01:57.946
And you don't run
shit around here
but your goddamn mouth.

1:01:57.948 --> 1:01:59.948
Yeah? This mouth
is gettin' us
all fuckin' paid.

1:01:59.950 --> 1:02:02.317
Where? Obviously,
not enough to buy some
fuckin' roach spray

1:02:02.319 --> 1:02:03.985
to spray the booth out.

1:02:08.224 --> 1:02:09.758
- Shut the fuck up!
- Fuck you.

1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:11.026
Exactly.
Talk to her.

1:02:11.028 --> 1:02:12.427
Fuck you.
Talk to her.

1:02:12.429 --> 1:02:14.196
I'm sick o' y'all
bickerin', man, for real.

1:02:14.198 --> 1:02:18.066
Can we please, please,
just focus for once?

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:19.801
Reasons is right, y'all.

1:02:19.803 --> 1:02:21.303
Let's just focus
and get it done.

1:02:22.038 --> 1:02:23.238
Come on.

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:24.773
<i> The sonnet</i>

1:02:24.775 --> 1:02:28.210
depicts love as
both pain and pleasure.

1:02:29.245 --> 1:02:32.214
As joy and anguish.

1:02:32.216 --> 1:02:34.483
As disdain and devotion.

1:02:35.284 --> 1:02:37.385
Relationships equate

1:02:37.387 --> 1:02:39.755
a surrendering of one's self.

1:02:40.523 --> 1:02:41.957
Mmm.

1:02:41.959 --> 1:02:44.159
Well, let's start here
next week.

1:02:48.965 --> 1:02:51.333
Hey, coco.
Wait up a minute.

1:02:54.170 --> 1:02:55.370
So, uh...

1:02:56.405 --> 1:02:57.839
How've you been?

1:02:58.341 --> 1:03:00.308
I'm good.

1:03:00.310 --> 1:03:02.043
Just been busy with my demo.

1:03:02.045 --> 1:03:05.080
Yeah, me, too, but I've been
working on my new poem.

1:03:05.082 --> 1:03:07.916
Still trying to get in
Coltrane's slam team.

1:03:07.918 --> 1:03:10.519
Just haven't got
the moves quite down.

1:03:10.521 --> 1:03:12.354
Don't switch up those moves.

1:03:14.891 --> 1:03:18.560
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said the other day.

1:03:20.196 --> 1:03:22.197
About what?

1:03:22.199 --> 1:03:24.166
About pretending
nothing happened.

1:03:25.301 --> 1:03:27.903
It's okay.

1:03:27.905 --> 1:03:31.840
We both just had
too much to drink and,
you know, shit happens.

1:03:33.509 --> 1:03:34.976
It's cool, though.

1:03:36.212 --> 1:03:37.279
Friends?

1:03:40.049 --> 1:03:41.850
Nah.
No?

1:03:41.852 --> 1:03:43.251
No.

1:03:43.253 --> 1:03:46.388
I want to be
more than friends.

1:03:48.891 --> 1:03:51.927
Coco Ford,
may I speak with you
for a moment, please?

1:04:06.943 --> 1:04:13.048
My husband and I are...
We're having
a salon on Saturday.

1:04:15.184 --> 1:04:16.251
I'd like you to come.

1:04:18.855 --> 1:04:21.122
Really?

1:04:21.124 --> 1:04:22.991
Don't tell anyone.

1:04:22.993 --> 1:04:24.559
But you can bring a date.

1:04:25.494 --> 1:04:26.928
Thanks.

1:04:39.275 --> 1:04:42.878
We have one shot to
get our songs right
for this record label.

1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:45.647
These guys
just don't get it.

1:04:45.649 --> 1:04:47.382
So, when is the showcase?

1:04:47.384 --> 1:04:48.950
Labor day.

1:04:48.952 --> 1:04:50.652
You comin'?

1:04:50.654 --> 1:04:52.921
Is that an invite?
Maybe.

1:04:54.424 --> 1:04:58.193
Look, listen, I have
an important question for you.

1:04:58.195 --> 1:04:59.594
Is it a really
important question or

1:04:59.596 --> 1:05:01.129
like, a dumb
important question?

1:05:01.131 --> 1:05:03.265
Course it's
an important question.

1:05:03.267 --> 1:05:06.067
Fire away.

1:05:06.069 --> 1:05:08.303
Why can't you tell me
what you and
Dixon whispered about?

1:05:08.305 --> 1:05:10.906
Hmm. What's it
worth to you?

1:05:11.974 --> 1:05:13.208
Let me see.

1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:19.347
Well, that's a start.

1:05:19.349 --> 1:05:22.417
But just to let you know
that it wasn't about you.

1:05:22.419 --> 1:05:25.553
Okay, so now you have
secrets with my boss,
i see what's goin' on.

1:05:25.555 --> 1:05:28.089
Fine. She invited me
to a salon.

1:05:29.992 --> 1:05:32.193
Seriously?
Yeah.

1:05:32.195 --> 1:05:33.695
So, is she gonna have a
bunch of hairdressers at
her house or something?

1:05:33.697 --> 1:05:36.298
Nah, nah, nah,
it's a poetry salon.

1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:39.935
It's where people go
and showcase
their work, their art.

1:05:40.636 --> 1:05:42.037
Are you going?

1:05:44.307 --> 1:05:45.507
I wasn't invited.

1:05:45.509 --> 1:05:47.275
She probably forgot.

1:05:47.277 --> 1:05:50.578
I wasn't invited
last year either.

1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:52.480
Just be careful with Dixon.

1:05:52.482 --> 1:05:54.482
She likes to toy with people.

1:05:54.484 --> 1:05:57.385
I do feel like I'm
finally starting to make
progress with her.

1:05:59.355 --> 1:06:03.992
Well, I'm just saying
you should keep an eye out.

1:06:03.994 --> 1:06:07.128
Well, she told me
to bring a date.

1:06:07.130 --> 1:06:09.497
So I'm gonna bring you.

1:06:09.499 --> 1:06:10.966
So you can watch out.

1:06:10.968 --> 1:06:12.600
In case anyone
tries anything tricky.

1:06:12.602 --> 1:06:14.202
Well, I'll be watchin'.

1:06:20.242 --> 1:06:22.277
You look great tonight.
Thank you.

1:06:25.314 --> 1:06:26.414
I think this is us.

1:06:32.521 --> 1:06:34.022
You make me laugh.

1:06:35.558 --> 1:06:37.325
Seriously, though
you are something.

1:06:37.327 --> 1:06:39.361
Coco.

1:06:39.363 --> 1:06:42.664
You've made it.
How are you, Mrs. Dixon?

1:06:42.666 --> 1:06:46.668
Thank you so much
for inviting me here.
Your house is amazing.

1:06:46.670 --> 1:06:49.337
I need to steal
her for a moment.

1:06:49.339 --> 1:06:50.572
I know you won't mind.

1:06:51.173 --> 1:06:53.108
Come.

1:06:53.110 --> 1:06:57.512
Coco, you are
such a good writer.

1:06:57.514 --> 1:07:02.217
You've advanced immeasurably
since your first assignment.

1:07:02.219 --> 1:07:05.420
It's actually miraculous.

1:07:05.422 --> 1:07:07.222
I've been working
like, really hard.

1:07:09.425 --> 1:07:12.460
You have a voice.

1:07:16.232 --> 1:07:17.298
Ah...

1:07:18.401 --> 1:07:20.301
The voice of a poet.

1:07:21.804 --> 1:07:23.071
I just...

1:07:25.808 --> 1:07:29.544
I just worry that
you're wasting your time

1:07:29.546 --> 1:07:32.447
with a lover that'll
never love you back.

1:07:33.382 --> 1:07:36.551
What? I don't understand.

1:07:36.553 --> 1:07:39.220
You're a smart woman, coco.

1:07:39.222 --> 1:07:43.358
Flirting with a ta
for a good grade?

1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:45.660
That's so beneath you.
No. No, no, no.

1:07:45.662 --> 1:07:47.762
It's not like that.

1:07:47.764 --> 1:07:49.664
Okay, well, I'll...

1:07:51.333 --> 1:07:52.734
I take it back.

1:07:53.569 --> 1:07:54.736
Come on.

1:07:55.805 --> 1:07:57.539
Coltrane.

1:07:57.541 --> 1:08:01.743
This is my most
promising student,
coco Ford.

1:08:01.745 --> 1:08:04.579
How you doin'?
I remember you
from the other night.

1:08:04.581 --> 1:08:07.182
Yeah, yeah.
You made your boy here lose.

1:08:08.551 --> 1:08:10.518
Coltrane and his slams.

1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:14.589
Everyone's always
trying to impress him so
they can make the new team.

1:08:14.591 --> 1:08:18.726
Well, baby, you know slam saw
where poetry was messin' up

1:08:18.728 --> 1:08:21.596
and I just wanna
make things right.
Hmm.

1:08:21.598 --> 1:08:24.799
You know,
it's a whole generation
of young poets like coco

1:08:24.801 --> 1:08:27.202
who have been
raised on hip-hop

1:08:27.204 --> 1:08:29.337
and brought up
by poets like us.

1:08:29.339 --> 1:08:31.739
This is our duty.
Yes.

1:08:31.741 --> 1:08:35.243
You do know how to
please young girls.

1:08:38.781 --> 1:08:40.548
Um...

1:08:40.550 --> 1:08:45.420
I'm going to read
in just a moment.

1:08:45.422 --> 1:08:46.821
You should come outside.

1:08:46.823 --> 1:08:48.389
What the fuck?

1:08:51.694 --> 1:08:58.533
Accompanying me is the
amazing and beautiful
Esperanza spalding.

1:09:07.476 --> 1:09:11.479
"I am the kind of
woman who loses things.

1:09:11.481 --> 1:09:16.851
"The kind of
woman who makes room
for a child she lost.

1:09:16.853 --> 1:09:20.655
"I am the kind of woman
who keeps the porch light on.

1:09:20.657 --> 1:09:22.323
"The kitchen light on.

1:09:22.325 --> 1:09:24.559
"The bathroom light on.

1:09:24.561 --> 1:09:27.162
"I am the kind of woman
who keeps the light on.

1:09:27.897 --> 1:09:29.464
"During sex.

1:09:30.299 --> 1:09:31.866
"During naptime.

1:09:31.868 --> 1:09:33.801
"After dark.

1:09:33.803 --> 1:09:36.204
"It is safe that way.

1:09:36.206 --> 1:09:40.808
"I am the kind of woman
who needs to feel safe.

1:09:40.810 --> 1:09:45.446
"The kind of woman
who has needs
that no one can satisfy.

1:09:46.682 --> 1:09:51.819
"I am never satisfied
with things god allows.

1:09:51.821 --> 1:09:55.790
"I am the kind of woman
who sins for entertainment.

1:09:55.792 --> 1:10:01.196
"Who says ugly things
about ugly people.

1:10:01.198 --> 1:10:04.666
"Who says even uglier things
about prettier people

1:10:04.668 --> 1:10:07.802
"who have been ugly to me.

1:10:07.804 --> 1:10:12.974
"I am the kind of woman
who is ugly for fun.

1:10:12.976 --> 1:10:15.910
"And god knows
i could be so much prettier.

1:10:17.379 --> 1:10:20.481
"I am the kind of woman

1:10:20.483 --> 1:10:24.219
"who uses her
vagina as a missile.

1:10:24.221 --> 1:10:30.558
"Who will beg your pardon,
if you ask for it.

1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:34.762
"Who will bust your head,
if you ask for it.

1:10:34.764 --> 1:10:40.268
"Who will help
you bust your nut,
if you ask for it.

1:10:42.438 --> 1:10:46.741
"I am the kind of woman
who says things like,

1:10:46.743 --> 1:10:49.911
"'don't ask me for shit.'

1:10:51.981 --> 1:10:57.885
"but I will give up
anything if you need it.

1:10:57.887 --> 1:10:59.554
"But be cautious.

1:11:00.489 --> 1:11:02.023
"Because I lose things.

1:11:03.859 --> 1:11:05.593
"Like children."

1:11:22.778 --> 1:11:26.381
Does anyone else
want to share tonight?

1:11:26.383 --> 1:11:28.383
I mean,
who wants to follow that?

1:11:31.053 --> 1:11:33.888
Miss Ford,
you wanna share anything?

1:11:33.890 --> 1:11:35.790
I don't have
anything prepared.

1:11:35.792 --> 1:11:37.325
Oh, come on.

1:11:49.638 --> 1:11:51.806
Please, don't make me do this.

1:11:51.808 --> 1:11:54.742
I don't like when
people tell me, "no."

1:11:56.445 --> 1:12:01.316
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is my protege,

1:12:01.318 --> 1:12:06.487
the very
opinionated and talented
hip-hop poet,

1:12:06.489 --> 1:12:07.889
coco Ford.

1:12:15.664 --> 1:12:17.732
I hope you like this.

1:12:55.003 --> 1:12:57.004
That's enough. Thank you.

1:12:58.140 --> 1:12:59.874
Thank you so much.

1:12:59.876 --> 1:13:02.143
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:09.684
She is both
talented and opinionated.

1:13:13.555 --> 1:13:16.157
Well, you can see
how important it is

1:13:16.159 --> 1:13:21.095
for all of us to continue
to uplift the unenlightened.

1:13:25.701 --> 1:13:27.568
Coco.

1:13:27.570 --> 1:13:29.003
Listen, we gotta
talk about this.

1:13:29.005 --> 1:13:30.638
Nothing to
talk about. It's over.

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:32.073
I'm done.
Look, coco, wait.

1:13:32.075 --> 1:13:33.674
Why would she
invite me out just to

1:13:33.676 --> 1:13:35.143
embarrass me in front
of all of her friends?

1:13:35.145 --> 1:13:37.645
Dixon likes to
toy with people.

1:13:37.647 --> 1:13:40.648
It's like her
twisted way of teaching.

1:13:40.650 --> 1:13:43.785
She actually believes that
hard lessons are poetic.

1:13:43.787 --> 1:13:45.453
I'm dropping the course.

1:13:46.688 --> 1:13:49.590
You have a gift.

1:13:53.796 --> 1:13:56.631
But if we're
being perfectly honest
with ourselves.

1:13:56.633 --> 1:13:58.466
What happened in there...
I know.

1:13:58.468 --> 1:14:00.768
It was a rap, not a poem.

1:14:04.072 --> 1:14:05.940
Come on, you.
Let's get out of here.

1:14:09.011 --> 1:14:10.878
"As you learn to
love yourself better."

1:14:11.947 --> 1:14:14.015
"Teach me.

1:14:14.017 --> 1:14:16.017
"As you learn to
forgive yourself for failing."

1:14:16.885 --> 1:14:17.952
"Teach me."

1:14:22.192 --> 1:14:23.458
Ready? Switch.

1:14:27.796 --> 1:14:29.564
"The way
the light shines through

1:14:29.566 --> 1:14:31.566
"your window was
always brighter to me.

1:14:31.568 --> 1:14:33.801
"The way the shadow
falls on your doorstep
is more inviting.

1:14:34.903 --> 1:14:36.671
"You've shaken my world."

1:14:36.673 --> 1:14:38.172
"You've awoken
my dreams."

1:14:39.508 --> 1:14:40.975
"You free my soul."

1:14:40.977 --> 1:14:42.610
"You set my goals."

1:14:43.245 --> 1:14:44.846
"So...

1:14:44.848 --> 1:14:46.614
"Come run with me."
"Come run with me."

1:14:48.250 --> 1:14:50.852
That's beautiful.

1:14:50.854 --> 1:14:53.921
Thank you.
Thank you.

1:14:53.923 --> 1:14:55.490
Read it again.

1:14:57.826 --> 1:14:59.260
I've got a better idea.

1:15:30.292 --> 1:15:33.160
Really blows my mind.

1:15:33.162 --> 1:15:35.563
The way he expresses
love with his words?

1:15:35.565 --> 1:15:36.697
Quite magical.

1:15:41.971 --> 1:15:43.804
Oh, don't get that.

1:15:43.806 --> 1:15:46.073
Si's finest
can't have you today.

1:15:47.309 --> 1:15:49.644
I have to get it.
It's my mom.

1:15:51.046 --> 1:15:52.179
Hi, mom.

1:15:52.181 --> 1:15:53.314
<i> Where are you?</i>

1:15:53.316 --> 1:15:55.216
At my friend Derek's house.

1:15:55.218 --> 1:15:56.784
<i> Honey, I need you.</i>

1:15:56.786 --> 1:15:59.654
<i> Missy canceled.</i>
<i> You gotta come in.</i>

1:15:59.656 --> 1:16:01.188
Really?

1:16:01.190 --> 1:16:02.823
<i> Girl.</i>
Ma...

1:16:03.859 --> 1:16:05.660
I'll be there in 20.

1:16:09.231 --> 1:16:10.965
Sorry. I gotta go to work.

1:16:12.100 --> 1:16:14.769
Couldn't we just
say no today?

1:16:14.771 --> 1:16:17.805
No, I can't say
no to my mom.
I'll come with you.

1:16:17.807 --> 1:16:19.707
What?

1:16:19.709 --> 1:16:22.977
Thanks but no.
Stay and enjoy your weekend.

1:16:22.979 --> 1:16:27.748
No, it's fine, I'm actually,
a specialty dishwasher person.

1:16:29.819 --> 1:16:31.285
Coco, I think it's
time you realized that

1:16:31.287 --> 1:16:33.955
I'm more than just
a poet with a pretty face.

1:16:33.957 --> 1:16:37.224
And I make
a fantastic Shepherd's pie
with Yorkshire pudding.

1:16:42.230 --> 1:16:44.665
Gonna go check in with mom.

1:16:46.635 --> 1:16:47.702
Okay.

1:16:55.744 --> 1:16:57.678
I don't care what you do.

1:16:57.680 --> 1:16:59.847
I just need you to
boil those carrots
until they are mush.

1:16:59.849 --> 1:17:02.383
We do not have
denture insurance
up in here.

1:17:02.385 --> 1:17:04.018
Hi, mom.
Don't you "hi, mom" me.

1:17:04.020 --> 1:17:05.386
Go put that apron on,
get to work.

1:17:05.388 --> 1:17:07.655
And where were you last night?

1:17:07.657 --> 1:17:10.257
And who is this new guy?
And why haven't I met him?

1:17:10.259 --> 1:17:12.026
He's here.
What do you mean, "he here?"

1:17:12.028 --> 1:17:13.928
You brought him here, girl?

1:17:13.930 --> 1:17:16.797
I don't have time to entertain
the hip-hop nation.

1:17:16.799 --> 1:17:19.333
He better not be out there
smoking dope with
old man Johnson.

1:17:19.335 --> 1:17:21.869
Mom, chill.
It's not even like that.

1:17:21.871 --> 1:17:25.039
And besides,
he insisted on helping.

1:17:25.041 --> 1:17:28.142
Helping? Yeah, right.
Helping to eat my food.

1:17:28.144 --> 1:17:31.045
Do I need to remind
you of your priorities,
young lady?

1:17:31.047 --> 1:17:32.780
Where is he?

1:17:36.852 --> 1:17:38.886
You guys all set? Fantastic.

1:17:38.888 --> 1:17:41.122
Ladies, I'm gonna take
this dirty plate away.

1:17:41.124 --> 1:17:43.824
I'll be back in two seconds
if you need anything else.

1:17:43.826 --> 1:17:46.293
Guys, coffee?
Coffee. Coffee.

1:17:46.295 --> 1:17:48.095
I've got you covered, okay?

1:17:51.166 --> 1:17:53.300
Oh, he is a cutie.

1:17:57.773 --> 1:17:59.707
I know that look.

1:17:59.709 --> 1:18:00.941
Yes, I do.

1:18:02.444 --> 1:18:03.711
Uh-huh.

1:18:04.212 --> 1:18:05.780
Oh!

1:18:09.918 --> 1:18:12.286
Mom, you're such a creep.

1:18:12.288 --> 1:18:13.988
I like him.

1:18:15.157 --> 1:18:17.324
Girl, go help that boy.

1:18:17.326 --> 1:18:18.859
I got this.

1:18:48.957 --> 1:18:51.092
You wrote that shit, co?

1:18:51.094 --> 1:18:54.095
I wrote it as a poem,
actually. Play it again.

1:19:08.977 --> 1:19:10.277
What do you think?

1:19:12.514 --> 1:19:14.982
That shit cool, man.

1:19:14.984 --> 1:19:17.251
So you a poet now
like your boy Harry Potter?

1:19:17.253 --> 1:19:21.322
No, I'm a rapper who wants to
better herself with poetry.

1:19:21.324 --> 1:19:25.459
I've written more
in the last month
than I have in years.

1:19:29.531 --> 1:19:33.134
No, I ain't feeling it.
Or your whole new direction.

1:19:33.136 --> 1:19:35.236
I mean, coco, it's cool
and all, but it doesn't

1:19:35.238 --> 1:19:37.872
sound like any of
our other songs.

1:19:37.874 --> 1:19:39.940
Well, this is where
I'm at right now, so...

1:19:39.942 --> 1:19:43.077
I've been busting
my ass writing lyrics
and here you come.

1:19:43.079 --> 1:19:45.146
On some hallmark
greeting card type shit?

1:19:45.148 --> 1:19:49.016
I've had to rap around
your stupid thug fantasy
lyrics for years.

1:19:49.018 --> 1:19:51.118
You could at least
just give me one song.

1:19:56.224 --> 1:19:58.192
Save that shit for
a poetry reading.

1:19:59.828 --> 1:20:01.529
Well, if I can't make
the music I want then

1:20:01.531 --> 1:20:04.298
what's the point of
me being in the group?

1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:06.200
Maybe you don't need
to be in the group.

1:20:10.572 --> 1:20:12.173
Coke...
This is bullshit.

1:20:12.175 --> 1:20:14.208
Coke, he didn't mean that.
Yes, I did.

1:20:14.210 --> 1:20:16.177
Malik,
you didn't mean that shit.

1:20:16.179 --> 1:20:18.145
You better
believe I did.

1:20:25.453 --> 1:20:27.421
Yo, reas, play my shit.

1:20:29.424 --> 1:20:30.858
Play that.

1:20:31.259 --> 1:20:32.326
Yeah.

1:20:42.470 --> 1:20:45.072
<i> Hi, it's Derek.</i>
<i> You've reached my voicemail.</i>

1:20:45.074 --> 1:20:47.174
<i> It's finals time so</i>
<i> I've been pretty busy,</i>

1:20:47.176 --> 1:20:50.044
<i> but please leave</i>
<i> a message after the beep.</i>

1:20:50.046 --> 1:20:53.914
Hey, Derek, it's me, coco.
I know you have
a late class, but...

1:20:53.916 --> 1:20:56.116
I just really need
to hear your voice right now,

1:20:56.118 --> 1:20:58.118
I'm having a terrible day.

1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:01.088
Call me back when
you get this. Bye.

1:21:22.911 --> 1:21:24.511
Things are
different now.

1:21:27.215 --> 1:21:28.482
You what?

1:21:30.619 --> 1:21:33.053
Things are just as
they've always been.

1:21:34.356 --> 1:21:36.323
You're seriously?

1:21:37.659 --> 1:21:40.661
Look, look, look.
I can't do this anymore.

1:21:48.236 --> 1:21:51.171
Hey, don't go.
Don't mess up a good thing.

1:22:03.118 --> 1:22:05.219
Coco! Coco, wait!

1:22:05.221 --> 1:22:07.154
Coco, listen!

1:22:07.156 --> 1:22:10.357
Let me explain to you.
Please, please stop!
Just stop!

1:22:10.359 --> 1:22:13.527
Just let me explain, okay?

1:22:13.529 --> 1:22:18.098
I've been reading
professor Dixon's poetry
since high school.

1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:20.434
She's the whole reason
i came to America.

1:22:20.436 --> 1:22:24.138
I sent her my writing
and she gave me
a full scholarship.

1:22:25.407 --> 1:22:28.676
Coco, I come from nothing.

1:22:30.712 --> 1:22:33.647
No one ever did
anything like that
for me before.

1:22:37.218 --> 1:22:40.454
Listen,
i knew it wasn't right.

1:22:40.456 --> 1:22:43.958
But it started
happening and...

1:22:45.593 --> 1:22:48.195
I didn't know
how to make it stop.

1:22:48.197 --> 1:22:50.698
No, coco! Listen, please.

1:22:50.700 --> 1:22:52.633
Please. Please,
please, please.

1:22:52.635 --> 1:22:55.002
I have one question.

1:22:55.004 --> 1:22:57.538
What was gonna happen
if I didn't walk in?

1:23:03.078 --> 1:23:05.045
You were supposed
to be different.

1:24:44.746 --> 1:24:48.449
Okay, class.
Final exam starts now.

1:24:53.088 --> 1:24:56.256
Coco? Coco. Where are you?

1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:15.175
How'd you find me here?
Talked to your moms.

1:25:15.177 --> 1:25:18.212
She said you had
a lot on your mind.
So where else would you be?

1:25:21.716 --> 1:25:24.718
Damn. Harry Potter really
got up in your head, huh?

1:25:30.458 --> 1:25:34.428
Thinking about
maybe we can get
the group back together?

1:25:34.430 --> 1:25:36.663
Is that your way of
saying you're sorry?

1:25:36.665 --> 1:25:38.665
Sorry for what?

1:25:38.667 --> 1:25:41.835
For giving naveen
our mix demo?

1:25:41.837 --> 1:25:44.571
You sent our demo to naveen?
Yup.

1:25:45.607 --> 1:25:47.774
What did he say?

1:25:47.776 --> 1:25:50.811
What did who say?
Naveen.

1:25:50.813 --> 1:25:53.647
Well, he liked it.
He liked the tracks.
He thinks we got potential.

1:25:53.649 --> 1:25:55.415
Come on, what did he say?

1:25:56.918 --> 1:26:02.189
Nah, he said,
si's finest is headlining

1:26:02.191 --> 1:26:04.558
the rough street
records showcase.
We did it.

1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:06.860
He loved our shit.

1:26:06.862 --> 1:26:08.595
For real?
For real.

1:26:10.632 --> 1:26:12.933
Right? That's crazy, right?

1:26:12.935 --> 1:26:15.536
So you back, right?
You back in the group.

1:26:15.538 --> 1:26:16.803
Yeah.
Yeah?

1:26:16.805 --> 1:26:18.605
Yeah, yeah.
All right.

1:26:20.775 --> 1:26:22.576
The only thing is...

1:26:24.379 --> 1:26:27.281
He didn't accept
your solo track.

1:26:27.283 --> 1:26:29.283
He said it was too
different, too slow.

1:26:30.285 --> 1:26:31.585
It didn't fit.

1:26:38.826 --> 1:26:40.460
Do you agree with him?

1:26:44.299 --> 1:26:45.566
Fellas do.

1:26:46.701 --> 1:26:48.702
We gotta stick
to who we are, co.

1:26:50.438 --> 1:26:51.805
Si's finest, right?

1:26:53.841 --> 1:26:55.309
Right?
Yeah.

1:26:55.311 --> 1:26:56.777
Yeah?

1:26:56.779 --> 1:26:58.412
All right.

1:26:58.414 --> 1:27:00.214
Let's just go out
there and kill it then.

1:27:00.216 --> 1:27:02.382
That's what
I'm talking about.
Let's go kill it.

1:27:02.384 --> 1:27:04.585
Coco! Coco! Coco!

1:27:04.587 --> 1:27:06.753
Shut up. Stupid.

1:27:14.562 --> 1:27:15.963
I have one question.

1:27:20.602 --> 1:27:25.539
Did you really fail my class
as a way to punish me?

1:27:26.941 --> 1:27:29.543
Because I thought
you were smarter than that.

1:27:32.580 --> 1:27:35.816
I expected so much
more from you, coco.

1:27:39.454 --> 1:27:41.421
Today, I emerge as a writer.

1:27:43.358 --> 1:27:45.525
What angels dare to dream.

1:27:45.527 --> 1:27:49.329
Every day tears
fall from my eyes
is a day I survive.

1:27:49.331 --> 1:27:52.466
Conquering
the crumbling mountains
of self-doubt.

1:27:52.468 --> 1:27:55.435
I am no longer
a dream deferred.

1:27:55.437 --> 1:27:57.271
My growth is inevitable.

1:27:58.740 --> 1:28:02.843
Who I am requires you
to see past your ego.

1:28:03.578 --> 1:28:05.479
And see me.

1:28:07.749 --> 1:28:09.650
You can't grade me
like a piece of meat.

1:28:09.652 --> 1:28:12.653
I am the embodiment
of verses and stanzas.

1:28:12.655 --> 1:28:16.023
Of freedom
fighters and poetry slams.
We are no different.

1:28:16.025 --> 1:28:19.993
If you examine the
diameter of hip-hop's
slang and grammar,

1:28:19.995 --> 1:28:23.664
you'll find that
it is very similar
to the iambic pentameter.

1:28:23.666 --> 1:28:25.832
But you're so ignorant.

1:28:25.834 --> 1:28:29.369
Rappers are poets.
And poets are rappers.

1:28:29.371 --> 1:28:32.406
Only academics are
too afraid to admit it.

1:28:32.408 --> 1:28:35.742
And despite what you think,
i did learn one thing.

1:28:35.744 --> 1:28:38.712
That the truth is inevitable.

1:28:38.714 --> 1:28:41.815
Oh. And yeah,
it doesn't have to rhyme.

1:28:49.357 --> 1:28:51.391
For what it's worth,

1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:56.630
Derek came into my office
to tell me that it was over.

1:28:57.598 --> 1:28:59.533
I was the one hanging on.

1:29:02.770 --> 1:29:06.540
He dropped out of
the master's program today.

1:29:07.608 --> 1:29:12.079
He had one week left.

1:29:12.081 --> 1:29:16.783
He said that he didn't want
to earn his degree this way.

1:29:18.486 --> 1:29:20.053
I guess I was wrong then.

1:29:21.856 --> 1:29:23.523
He did love you back.

1:29:26.828 --> 1:29:28.395
That's poetry.

1:29:35.870 --> 1:29:37.738
You ready for tonight?

1:29:37.740 --> 1:29:40.807
Yeah.
I just have to go pick
up my jacket at Malik's.

1:29:43.010 --> 1:29:46.713
Okay now. Don't get nervous
and start talking
too fast, all right?

1:29:46.715 --> 1:29:49.516
Like you do when
you get nervous,
you talk fast.

1:29:49.518 --> 1:29:51.752
See, you got this.
You are so great at it.

1:29:51.754 --> 1:29:54.087
For you, baby,
this is like breathing

1:29:54.089 --> 1:29:57.090
so don't put any extra
pressure on yourself,
all right?

1:29:58.059 --> 1:29:59.893
Are you okay, mom?

1:29:59.895 --> 1:30:02.996
Lord, I'm a wreck.

1:30:02.998 --> 1:30:06.767
I just want you to know
that no matter
what happens tonight,

1:30:06.769 --> 1:30:09.403
baby, I am so proud of you.

1:30:13.741 --> 1:30:15.809
Thanks, mom.

1:30:15.811 --> 1:30:17.477
Just want you to
know that I'm going to

1:30:17.479 --> 1:30:20.680
finish my semester
and get my accounting degree.

1:30:20.682 --> 1:30:23.884
I've still got
plan b in the works.
I haven't forgotten about it.

1:30:23.886 --> 1:30:25.685
To hell with plan b.

1:30:25.687 --> 1:30:29.523
Tonight, I want you
to go out there and
make plan a happen.

1:30:52.079 --> 1:30:54.448
I wanna thank
everyone for supporting

1:30:54.450 --> 1:30:56.950
slam poetry and
the 5 boros team.

1:30:56.952 --> 1:30:59.186
Tonight, we're selecting
four people.

1:30:59.188 --> 1:31:02.856
These are the best
of New York City.

1:31:11.799 --> 1:31:13.733
Coco. Hey, coco.

1:31:15.069 --> 1:31:16.570
Hey, naveen.

1:31:16.572 --> 1:31:17.904
Thanks so much for
letting us do this.

1:31:17.906 --> 1:31:20.807
No, I can't wait to
see your solo song tonight.

1:31:20.809 --> 1:31:23.109
We're not performing
the solo song.
Wait, what?

1:31:23.111 --> 1:31:26.513
Malik and reasons and Matt
said that you guys

1:31:26.515 --> 1:31:28.949
didn't like the solo song,
so we're just not gonna do it.

1:31:28.951 --> 1:31:31.251
That's the only song
that Richard and I even liked.

1:31:31.253 --> 1:31:33.153
We were willing to
tolerate the other songs,

1:31:33.155 --> 1:31:36.122
but I was very
clear with Malik
and the boys about this.

1:31:36.124 --> 1:31:38.825
I need you, okay?
Okay.

1:31:48.870 --> 1:31:50.203
Co...

1:31:50.205 --> 1:31:51.605
Fucking liar.

1:31:51.607 --> 1:31:53.607
No one gives
a damn about naveen,

1:31:53.609 --> 1:31:55.775
what he thinks or
what Richard thinks.

1:31:55.777 --> 1:31:57.744
I think they're
wrong since day one.

1:31:57.746 --> 1:31:59.679
They been wrong
the whole time.

1:31:59.681 --> 1:32:01.081
You all knew about this.

1:32:01.083 --> 1:32:02.582
Your songs just
don't fit, all right?

1:32:02.584 --> 1:32:04.251
They're not who we are.
And you a part of us.

1:32:04.253 --> 1:32:05.919
You really think
rough street records

1:32:05.921 --> 1:32:07.587
is gonna give us
a second chance?

1:32:07.589 --> 1:32:09.055
Look, they're just trying
to make money off us.

1:32:09.057 --> 1:32:10.891
They charging $20,
$30 to get in here.

1:32:10.893 --> 1:32:13.026
And we ain't
even getting paid.

1:32:13.028 --> 1:32:15.228
We're gonna go
out there and we're gonna
make so much noise,

1:32:15.230 --> 1:32:17.898
all of them,
everybody gonna be
wanting to sign us.

1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:21.034
All right,
and gonna do it our way.

1:32:21.036 --> 1:32:23.236
Si's finest way.
From the beginning.

1:32:23.238 --> 1:32:24.571
Let's do this.

1:32:26.908 --> 1:32:28.675
Don't fucking touch me.

1:32:29.310 --> 1:32:30.710
Come on.

1:32:32.914 --> 1:32:34.047
Co...

1:32:35.550 --> 1:32:36.816
You okay?

1:32:52.301 --> 1:32:56.202
What up, yo?
How y'all doing?

1:32:56.204 --> 1:32:58.905
And we can't forget
the female of the group.
Beautiful.

1:32:58.907 --> 1:33:00.607
Coco!

1:33:05.780 --> 1:33:09.349
This is a coco Ford song
that you almost
didn't hear tonight.

1:34:57.793 --> 1:35:00.460
Coming to you
from across the waters.

1:35:00.462 --> 1:35:03.329
All the way from
London, england.

1:35:03.331 --> 1:35:05.331
You all make some noise.

1:35:05.333 --> 1:35:06.766
For Derek Morris.

1:35:10.404 --> 1:35:11.871
Thank you.

1:35:20.381 --> 1:35:23.249
She does to me
what winter does to the trees.

1:35:24.819 --> 1:35:29.322
She strips me bare,
naked and empty.

1:35:29.324 --> 1:35:31.324
I laugh to myself, because...

1:35:31.326 --> 1:35:32.959
I can't sing, it's just...

1:35:35.162 --> 1:35:37.330
She makes me want
to try and harmonize.

1:35:38.499 --> 1:35:40.400
Like...

1:35:40.402 --> 1:35:45.939
Like I've got no worries
bothering me tomorrow.

1:35:45.941 --> 1:35:49.442
Like I've got no
dirty clothes hamper
full of yesterdays...

1:35:49.444 --> 1:35:52.178
Stinking up what
future is left in me.

1:35:53.380 --> 1:35:54.447
But I...

1:35:55.416 --> 1:35:57.117
I really ain't no Saint.

1:36:00.755 --> 1:36:02.355
Never felt love's true bliss.

1:36:06.994 --> 1:36:10.997
A disciple of my father,
i learned to love
with clenched fists.

1:36:10.999 --> 1:36:14.000
I learned to love like
reading braille on skin.

1:36:14.002 --> 1:36:15.902
Tracing the insecurities
of women

1:36:15.904 --> 1:36:17.771
through the palms
of their hands.

1:36:18.305 --> 1:36:20.940
But with her...

1:36:22.810 --> 1:36:24.077
It was different.

1:36:27.948 --> 1:36:33.353
See, she was in every
single word I wrote.

1:36:38.025 --> 1:36:40.927
She walked a poet's refrain.

1:36:40.929 --> 1:36:42.962
Spoke a sweet soliloquy.

1:36:45.900 --> 1:36:49.903
But I recognize
the lack of trust
in my own heart.

1:36:53.841 --> 1:36:56.409
Because only a fool won't
accept the nourishment

1:36:56.411 --> 1:36:58.444
that's
right before their eyes.

1:36:59.446 --> 1:37:01.347
Instead he will starve.

1:37:05.386 --> 1:37:09.055
I look at her and
every time she smiles,

1:37:09.057 --> 1:37:11.424
it reminds me of everything
i stole from myself.

1:37:12.293 --> 1:37:15.195
Every joy...

1:37:15.197 --> 1:37:18.598
Every joy I never had
the courage to taste.

1:37:20.434 --> 1:37:23.069
As you learn to
love yourself better...

1:37:23.071 --> 1:37:24.204
Teach me.

1:37:35.249 --> 1:37:38.017
As you learn to forgive
yourself for failing...

1:37:38.552 --> 1:37:40.086
Teach me.

1:37:44.291 --> 1:37:47.427
As you learn to
accept strength
and vulnerability...

1:37:48.095 --> 1:37:49.495
Teach me.

1:38:03.077 --> 1:38:05.545
Some days I miss
the burn of a love lost.

1:38:07.281 --> 1:38:09.916
Or maybe...
Just maybe.

1:38:12.586 --> 1:38:16.055
I never found true love.
Until right now.

1:38:21.562 --> 1:38:23.062
I love you, coco.

1:38:25.032 --> 1:38:27.066
Like, I loved you.

1:38:59.066 --> 1:39:01.167
Derek Morris.

1:39:01.169 --> 1:39:03.636
