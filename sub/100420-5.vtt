WEBVTT

00:09.467 --> 00:11.511
In my line of work,
I meet a lot of big names.

00:11.594 --> 00:15.181
I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s.
Nick Nolte. Mickey Rourke.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.891
Literally, here we are in the '90s,

00:16.975 --> 00:19.185
and these are the guys
we think are sexy, right?

00:19.269 --> 00:21.271
And my daughter couldn't care less.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.315
But when I told her
I was meeting BoJack Horseman...

00:24.399 --> 00:26.192
Do me a favor. Make her day.

00:26.651 --> 00:27.485
[sighs]

00:27.736 --> 00:29.779
Me? I didn't ask for this gig.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.615
Angela Diaz,
head of the network, calls me,

00:32.699 --> 00:34.451
working schmuck, Danny Bananas,

00:34.534 --> 00:39.080
and says, "Danny, Herb Kazzaz is leavin',
and I want you to run 'Horsin' Around.'"

00:39.164 --> 00:41.624
So, here's me, thinking,
"What an opportunity

00:41.708 --> 00:44.502
to write for the most finely-calibrated
ensemble cast on television!"

00:44.586 --> 00:46.629
It's like a bowling alley
with you people.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.340
Setting up pins and knocking them down.
I should be so lucky.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.092
-Uh.
-I know it's no secret

00:51.176 --> 00:52.552
that you and Herb had some friction,

00:52.635 --> 00:55.430
and he left the show
under not-great circumstances.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.390
Now I'm coming at this from a place of:

00:57.474 --> 01:00.060
This is your house,
and I'm a guest, all right?

01:00.310 --> 01:03.646
The magic of "Horsin' Around"
is not Herb Kazzaz or Danny Bananas.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.941
I know why people buy the Big Mac.
I'm not here to change the recipe.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.235
You're the special sauce, BoJack.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.362
Me? I just wanna be the bun.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.657
And not even the top or the bottom bun.
I'm fine being the middle bun.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.785
-You already told me this story.
-I did?

01:16.868 --> 01:20.080
Yeah. Danny. Sharona. The buns.
We've been over it.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.749
-Well, did I tell you about Gina?
-Yes.

01:22.832 --> 01:25.043
-And Sarah Lynn?
-Multiple times. Yes.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.921
-What about the time I sneezed on Marisa?
-You've told me everything.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.673
You told me about that dream
where you go to a dinner party.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.509
I even went down
that strange detour with you

01:32.592 --> 01:35.720
about the three-nippled woman in
the nudie magazine your uncle showed you.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.098
-Who was she?
-I think we're done here.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.392
-What do you mean, done?
-Well, you've been here six months.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.894
It's time to go home.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.938
[theme music playing]

02:38.116 --> 02:40.201
[Shannon] Oh, sorry. Uh, not this way.

02:40.743 --> 02:41.995
My boss is gonna kill me

02:42.078 --> 02:44.414
if I don't deliver these flowers
to his mistress.

02:44.497 --> 02:47.083
Well, we're filming
an episode of "Birthday Dad,"

02:47.167 --> 02:49.961
and my boss is gonna kill me
if I let anyone through.

02:50.044 --> 02:53.756
Great, when they discover my remains
scattered in the bramble of Griffith Park,

02:53.840 --> 02:55.967
my loved ones will take solace
knowing I died

02:56.050 --> 02:58.803
so they could shoot an episode
of "Birthday Dad."

02:58.887 --> 03:01.514
I'm sorry. It's a really good show!

03:03.141 --> 03:09.063
I know I couldn't always be there for you,
birthday-wise, but I'd like to be.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.733
I'd like to be your Birthday Dad.

03:11.816 --> 03:15.195
You really don't get it, do you?
This is the real world, okay?

03:15.278 --> 03:18.656
And I'm a career gal.
I don't have time for birthdays.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.742
But what about the birthday spirit?

03:20.825 --> 03:23.828
Everyone knows there's no such thing.
This is the real world.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.789
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to drink my coffee.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.708
-Cut. Let's move on.
-[bell rings]

03:28.791 --> 03:30.668
Great take, Melodie. Chills.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.421
Are we Glenn Close,
Jeff Goldblum, Kevin Kline,

03:33.504 --> 03:35.924
and all of the greatest Motown singles
collected on one...

03:36.007 --> 03:37.050
[groans]

03:37.175 --> 03:39.260
-[chuckles] "Big Chills."
-Hot herbal tea?

03:39.344 --> 03:40.970
-Yes, that would be-- Ooh!
-Ha!

03:41.054 --> 03:43.431
-Oops.
-[chuckles] Got me again, Audrey.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.475
Donna, we're gonna need another scarf.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.810
Am I crazy, or has the crew turned on you?

03:47.977 --> 03:50.730
No, what they're turned onto
is hating me...

03:50.813 --> 03:52.357
on account of I cheated on Pickles.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.775
Ever since the story went viral,

03:53.858 --> 03:57.028
the public has really mashed
the thumbs down on old Peanurino.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.322
-Especially young women.
-Oh, no!

03:59.405 --> 04:02.659
"Especially Young Women"
is one of our show's eight target demos.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.868
We gotta juice your Q!

04:04.035 --> 04:06.955
Right now, the only juice
I'm interested in is Pickles' juice

04:07.038 --> 04:11.042
and making things kosher between us,
which is a task I relish.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.253
-So, you wanna have sex with me?
-Yes.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.880
And your fiancé
is gonna be in there watching, or...

04:15.964 --> 04:17.715
Oh, no. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.551
This is not a fetish-based
cuckolding scenario.

04:20.635 --> 04:23.972
He had sex with his ex, so to level
the playing field now, we have to boink,

04:24.055 --> 04:26.891
so Mister and I can be even
and everything can go back to normal.

04:26.975 --> 04:27.809
You understand?

04:27.892 --> 04:29.519
Not really,
but I get to have sex with you?

04:29.602 --> 04:30.561
-Yeah.
-Correct.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.021
Then, cool. I'm in.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.108
-But what about your reputation?
-I'm not too worried about it.

04:35.483 --> 04:38.027
I feel like people
generally want to like me.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.864
And if I just don't do anything,
eventually, the universe will realign

04:41.948 --> 04:44.450
and the public will go back
to loving me again.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.411
-[grunts]
-Ugh.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.833
-Mm, thanks for making breakfast.
-Thanks for calling it breakfast.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.460
Not everyone appreciates
the subtle art of the crispy oatmeal.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.130
-Are you starting your memoir today?
-That was the plan.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.882
But I got these dishes now.
That'll take all morning.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.552
And once the morning's over,
basically the whole day is shot, you know?

05:02.635 --> 05:03.803
Better to start clean tomorrow.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.888
Look, I know it's hard
to start a new thing,

05:05.972 --> 05:08.349
but the hardest part is starting.

05:08.433 --> 05:09.267
You're right.

05:09.350 --> 05:12.478
Also, I'm a freelance cameraman
who pays child support,

05:12.562 --> 05:14.314
so I'd encourage you to get an advance.

05:14.897 --> 05:15.773
Hmm.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.318
[indistinct chattering]

05:18.401 --> 05:20.778
Hey, uh, guys? Uh, excuse me, everyone?

05:20.862 --> 05:24.532
I just wanted to raise
a non-alcoholic toast to Denise.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.451
-[laughter]
-Ha-ha!

05:26.534 --> 05:28.369
[man] Ow! My gluten intolerance!

05:28.453 --> 05:31.873
We've all been through so much together,
and it's never easy to say goodbye.

05:32.206 --> 05:34.459
-Remember when Doug left?
-[all] Hmm?

05:34.542 --> 05:36.210
-Or Jameson?
-[all muttering]

05:36.294 --> 05:37.420
Or sweet, sweet Bongo?

05:37.503 --> 05:40.131
-Sorry, who are we talking about?
-To Denise!

05:40.214 --> 05:41.674
[all] Denise!

05:41.758 --> 05:42.842
[man laughs]

05:43.259 --> 05:45.720
I didn't realize
we're the last of our original group.

05:45.803 --> 05:49.557
-God, we had some good times, huh?
-I mean, no, mostly.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.561
-Yeah. But you're ready, right?
-Ready or not, here I go.

05:53.644 --> 05:54.896
Yeah, you're ready.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.023
Have you given any thought
to what we discussed yesterday?

05:57.106 --> 06:00.234
About you transitioning to a version
of yourself that is no longer here?

06:00.318 --> 06:02.362
I don't know.
Things are kinda working for me.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.364
Staying out of trouble,
got the fancy room,

06:04.447 --> 06:06.282
finally perfected
my egg-white omelet order.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.285
The secret is egg yellows.
I might do another six weeks.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.579
[chuckles] You've already re-upped
three times.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.373
This place is for people in crisis.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.709
In crisis of being too cool, maybe.
Right, Karmen?

06:16.793 --> 06:21.255
-I-If I say yes, I can see my baby?
-Karmen, no.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.883
You sold your baby to a den of leeches
to pay for crack.

06:23.966 --> 06:27.261
-The leeches have your baby now.
-Oh, yeah.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.596
Ah. Classic Karm.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.348
It's natural to be hesitant.

06:30.431 --> 06:33.017
When I first checked out of rehab,
I was terrified.

06:33.101 --> 06:37.063
I knew a single drop of alcohol
would send me down a ruinous path.

06:37.146 --> 06:39.899
-But I found my way.
-Found your way back to rehab.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.610
-Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines.
-"Our?"

06:42.819 --> 06:44.487
A lot of people leave this place,

06:44.570 --> 06:47.907
and I think, "They're not gonna make it."
Like Denise, for example.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.369
But you?
You've done the work, and you're ready.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.621
You're a special case, BoJack.

06:53.704 --> 06:56.749
-I am?
-Of course you are.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.419
Huh.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.713
[Sharona] Oh, boy,
did he do a number on you.

07:04.465 --> 07:07.802
He was actually very nice.
You know, I want things to be easy on set.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.846
And I think Danny
represents a fresh start.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.473
-Is that why you got Herb fired?
-Hey, I'm not the one who...

07:12.557 --> 07:15.059
I can't do your hair
if you're gonna move your head so much.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.853
There was nothing I could do about Herb.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.147
If it wasn't for me,
they would've canceled the whole show.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.314
And then where would you go?

07:20.398 --> 07:22.692
Who's gonna hire
a hair and makeup lady with shaky hands?

07:22.984 --> 07:26.446
-My hands only shake when I don't drink.
-Be sure to put that on your résumé.

07:26.529 --> 07:30.324
You're just bitter because I'm the only
person who can drink as much as you do.

07:36.539 --> 07:37.582
-[giggles]
-Ruthie!

07:37.665 --> 07:39.375
-Here comes the airplane...
-[tires screech]

07:39.459 --> 07:41.836
-[car crashes]
-Oh, a kerfuffle!

07:41.919 --> 07:43.296
[people clamoring]

07:43.379 --> 07:45.131
Hey! What's going on out there?

07:45.423 --> 07:48.468
An ice cream truck
crashed into the root beer factory!

07:48.634 --> 07:51.512
Oh, sounds like a delicious disaster.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.265
-Five people are dead!
-Oh, no!

07:54.474 --> 07:55.850
And there's worse to come,

07:55.933 --> 07:59.437
unless somebody can slurp up
all that ice cream!

07:59.604 --> 08:03.983
Oh, I'd love to help slurp,
but I just started a new nannying job.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.569
I don't care!

08:06.736 --> 08:08.154
Hmm...

08:11.741 --> 08:14.660
Wow, BoJack leaving rehab.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.537
-Truly the end of an era.
-[crying]

08:16.621 --> 08:19.749
Sobby Bobby.
Gonna miss your excessive crying.

08:19.832 --> 08:20.666
Can't believe it.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.252
Last time I'm gonna stop
at this vending machine.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.797
What do you say, B-7?
One more hike down Funyun Canyon?

08:28.007 --> 08:31.177
[inhales] Whew.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.972
Oh, wow. Hello, the public.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.683
Didn't think I'd have to address this
so quickly, but I am not ashamed.

08:37.767 --> 08:41.437
-Yes, I, BoJack Horseman, went to rehab--
-Uh, keep it moving.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.730
We wanna get a clean shot

08:42.813 --> 08:47.902
for when Gen Z pop superstar/fashion
disrupter Joey Pogo shows up.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.571
-Joey Pogo?
-Yeah, he's checking in today.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.616
-We heard he's gettin' the fancy room.
-Fancy room?

08:54.617 --> 08:57.787
He's gettin' the fancy room.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.289
-It's time to go home.
-What?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.582
Ready or not.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.085
I got the fancy room.

09:04.168 --> 09:07.588
He's gettin' the fancy room.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.216
You're a special case, BoJack.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.386
Stay cool, man. Have a good summer.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.054
What does it all mean?

09:15.137 --> 09:17.473
Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.391
Huh?

09:18.474 --> 09:23.646
Sounds like they're kicking you out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.564
Oh, my God.

09:24.647 --> 09:28.109
I think they're kicking me out
to make room for Joey Pogo.

09:28.901 --> 09:32.196
I just feel like if I knew
the source of my addiction,

09:32.280 --> 09:34.699
everything else would just click together.

09:34.782 --> 09:35.908
-Playtime's over.
-BoJack!

09:35.992 --> 09:38.452
-What the hell? This is my time.
-Shut up, Brad.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.996
The source of your addiction

09:40.079 --> 09:43.291
is wanting to impress your old babysitter
who stole beer from your parents' fridge.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.542
She's dead. You're free.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.835
No, that's not...

09:45.918 --> 09:46.752
Oh. Oh...

09:46.836 --> 09:48.462
I thought you were checking out.

09:48.546 --> 09:54.051
-Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?
-Yes. I've been very clear on that matter.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.845
Well, check this out.

09:55.928 --> 10:00.182
BoHo go bye... BoHo go bye-bye for...

10:00.266 --> 10:01.392
What is he doing?

10:01.475 --> 10:03.978
I think he's trying to get out a zinger.
We better let him finish.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.980
You have to imagine that I just said it.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.441
It's only funny
if it feels extemporaneous.

10:08.524 --> 10:11.277
Don't waste your breath setting it up,
just say the thing.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.362
-Why don't you start over?
-Check this out.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.616
BoHo go bye-bye for JoJo Pogo?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.868
That's a no-go, bro.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.661
Worth it.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.204
[car horns blaring]

10:22.288 --> 10:25.082
I'm sorry. Please, go around.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.003
I worked on it all night.
The thing that's gonna save your career.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.838
Ha!

10:30.921 --> 10:33.966
-What is it?
-It's a meme! For posting online!

10:34.050 --> 10:36.552
Teacher gave you too much homework?
"Sad Dog!"

10:36.636 --> 10:39.597
Your favorite sports outfit
lost the match? "Sad Dog!"

10:39.680 --> 10:42.433
People are gonna love it.
And that love will transfer to you.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.603
But I'm not a sad dog.
I'm a happy dog. Everyone knows that.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.229
-So, it needs some massaging.
-[phone rings]

10:47.313 --> 10:48.314
Hold on, I gotta take this.

10:48.397 --> 10:51.901
Conversation over? "Sad Dog!"
See how easy it is?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.362
-[phone beeps]
-Pickles! How was your date with Carl?

10:54.570 --> 10:55.571
I don't know, Mister.

10:55.655 --> 11:00.284
The sex was good, like, really good,
but I didn't feel an emotional connection.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.912
Don't beat yourself up about that.
You just met the guy.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.581
But part of the betrayal
of you sleeping with Diane

11:05.665 --> 11:07.833
is the fact that you share
an intimate history.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.921
If we're really trying to even things out,
I don't think Carl counts.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.675
Okay, well, then I guess you'll just have
to keep having sex with people

11:15.758 --> 11:18.386
until you find someone with whom you have
an emotional connection.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.805
[sighs] That might be a lot of guys,

11:20.888 --> 11:23.849
but if that's what it's gonna take
to save our marriage,

11:23.933 --> 11:28.020
I will keep riding the express train
to bone-town until that happens.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.855
That's my girl.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.608
-Oh! Thank you.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.651

-Hello?

11:33.734 --> 11:34.652
Hey, it's Diane.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.738
Oh, yes, I thought I heard
retired dads in the distance,

11:37.822 --> 11:39.532
praising the '95 Chicago Bulls.

11:39.615 --> 11:41.867
Maybe you could give me some advice.
I'm writing a new book,

11:41.951 --> 11:45.454
but I shouldn't even get started
until I sell it to a publisher, right?

11:45.663 --> 11:47.873
-What is it?
-I'm still in the loose idea phase.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.458
Half essay, half memoir.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.543
The working title is,

11:50.626 --> 11:54.171
"One Last Thing, and Then I Swear to God
I'll Shut Up About This Forever:

11:54.255 --> 11:57.717
A Definitive Retrospective
of the Choices We Make,

11:57.800 --> 12:01.429
People We Hurt,
The Places We Go: Part One."

12:01.512 --> 12:04.598
How could it be part one if it's
definitive? I'm getting another call.

12:04.682 --> 12:05.516
-[phone beeps]
-Hello?

12:05.599 --> 12:07.143
Hi, while you were blabbering on,

12:07.226 --> 12:09.854
I had our lit assistant
take care of everything.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.940
A navel-gazey book of observations.
Sounds fun.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.734
-No, I--
-I sold it. You have six months.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.110
Enjoy the process.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.153
Oh.

12:18.946 --> 12:20.531
[groans]

12:22.700 --> 12:23.534
Wha...

12:25.453 --> 12:27.580
What happened?
You're packing your things backwards.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.665
What happened is you said I was special.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.834
You gave a whole spiel,
just trying to get rid of me

12:31.917 --> 12:33.878
to make room
for a high-profile new client.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.046
I thought we'd made strides
on your jealousy issues.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.673
And also, it's pronounced "shpeel."

12:37.757 --> 12:40.634
I'm not jealous! And I've definitely
seen it written out as "spiel."

12:40.718 --> 12:43.596
I think it's spelled "spiel,"
but it's pronounced "shpeel."

12:43.679 --> 12:44.930
Not now, Joey Pogo.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.726
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?
I was told I was in the fancy room?

12:48.809 --> 12:51.353
We're moving some things around.
Uh, maybe you could come back tomorrow?

12:51.437 --> 12:52.897
Oh, tomorrow is jammed.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.107
I'm shootin' a video
for my new single, "Lace Up,"

12:55.191 --> 12:57.985
which is spon-con
for my sneaker collab with Mister Pibb.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.864
-Could we just do it now, real quick?
-You wanna do rehab real quick?

13:01.947 --> 13:04.825
Life is precious. God is religious,
or merely the idea of human connection.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.285
Don't do drugs. Say you're sorry.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.497
Powerful stuff.
Feels like I just got a new lease on life.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.123
Stay cool, bro. Don't ever change.

13:11.415 --> 13:14.335
That's the problem. When you say it
in here, it all sounds easy.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.796
But I know that out there,
it's hard and confusing.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.173
-And it's just-- I-I don't...
-But you're not alone.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.133
You have a wonderful support system.

13:21.217 --> 13:26.889
Think of all your amazing friends,
just waiting to love you as you love them.

Um, okay. Is Todd there?

You're probably wondering about Georgette,

-Nope.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.124
Since I've started
taking care of Ruthie full-time,

13:54.208 --> 13:57.711
that hasn't given me a lot of time
for regular Todd business,

13:57.795 --> 13:59.672
and stuff's been falling
through the cracks.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.131
So, you hired an assistant?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.884
Well, yes, but assistants
are like Deadpool movies.

I couldn't just stop at one,
even though I probably should have.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.806
Now I have 12.

You hired 12 assistants? To assist you?

14:51.932 --> 14:54.727
can't do this by myself.

-Ah!

I'm Casey, the assistant.
Todd hired me to be your friend.

Okay, that's, uh, you know...
I think I'm good. Thank you.

15:11.994 --> 15:14.705
He said I would be perfect for you
because you could be mean to me

15:14.788 --> 15:16.707
and you wouldn't feel bad
because you're paying me.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.084
Okay, well, that's kind of thoughtful.

15:19.168 --> 15:22.630
I'm a very good assistant, and I can be
very discreet, whatever you need.

It was very therapeutic for him,
and I didn't mind

15:30.012 --> 15:32.598
because he wasn't screaming at me,
he was screaming at death.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.600
Stars really are just like us, huh?

15:34.683 --> 15:36.685
-Do you mind if I have a sip?
-Don't drink that!

15:36.769 --> 15:39.647
Right, of course.
I must earn hydration. So sorry.

15:39.813 --> 15:41.815
No, it's just... That's vodka.

15:41.899 --> 15:45.069
You think it's a good idea
to keep a bottle of vodka in rehab?

15:45.277 --> 15:47.780
Because it is if you think it is.

15:47.863 --> 15:48.906
It's not for drinking.

15:48.989 --> 15:52.952
I just, I... I don't know why I keep it.
As a reminder, I guess.

Why can't you do this
in Sarah Lynn's dressing room?

16:09.259 --> 16:11.679
My stepdad's in there,
and he's being weird.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.473
-Why is that my problem?
-We appreciate your hospitality.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.642
Hey, BoJack,
what do you think of the new guy?

16:16.725 --> 16:18.268
Danny? Yeah, he's okay. Right?

16:18.352 --> 16:20.521
-I miss Herb.
-We all do, sweetie.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.649
Herb. Danny. What difference does it make?
We got a job to do, right?

16:23.732 --> 16:25.109
I'm just saying I miss him.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.653
And I'm just saying
it's not my fault he got fired.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.655
-I dunno why you're complaining to me.
-I'm sorry.

16:29.738 --> 16:31.031
Nobody said it was your fault.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.283

Danny represents an opportunity.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.201
For a new beginning.

16:34.284 --> 16:38.414
You don't think it feels weird
to do the show without Herb?

16:38.497 --> 16:41.041
If Herb really cared about the show,
maybe he shouldn't have...

16:41.125 --> 16:42.126
What? Been gay?

16:42.209 --> 16:44.128
No, that's not-- Obviously...

-I put my ass on the line for you people.
-Ugh. BoJack.

16:46.547 --> 16:49.883
Do you know how lucky we are to have this?
Herb was gonna throw that all away.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.885
I made the tough choice. What did you do?

16:51.969 --> 16:54.930
-I... I don't know.
-BoJack, she's ten!

but don't take it out on a little girl.

[BoJack] I don't feel shitty,
I feel great!

17:10.821 --> 17:13.323
Okay. You know why this is here, Casey?

17:13.407 --> 17:16.702
It's because I think I'm special
and the rules don't apply to me.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.912
And I keep thinking that
over and over again.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.873
-Well, you are special.
-No, shut up.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.916
-[gasps]
-That's the problem. I'm an asshole.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.961
All your bosses are assholes.
And people like you indulge us.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.505
And you soothe our egos,
and you let us abuse you.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.675
-You're right, I'm terrible.
-No, God damn it. That's not my point.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.260
Have some respect for yourself.

17:33.343 --> 17:36.096
Okay, sorry.
I'm just happy to be a part of things.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.432
Yeah, and that's how they get you.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.436
[sighs] I'm sorry. It's not your fault.

17:42.519 --> 17:45.564
Can you run downstairs
and grab me some Funyuns?

17:45.647 --> 17:48.233
-Mm... No.
-What do you mean, no?

17:48.484 --> 17:49.693
Huh.

17:50.110 --> 17:53.739
I don't know. I'm not going to do that.

17:53.822 --> 17:57.409
-Uh, what's happening?
-There's an "I" in assistants.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.579
And this time, the "I" is us.

18:00.662 --> 18:03.207
I like your energy, but what?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.542
And lo and behold,
my sandwich has onions...

18:05.626 --> 18:06.460

18:06.543 --> 18:10.255

to tell you I didn't want onions.

Where are you going?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.884

This is a walk-out.

Mr. Peanutbutter said, "I'm a sad dog,"
and jumped right in front of the car.

19:34.047 --> 19:37.134
I think he's a really sad dog, you guys.
You know, like the meme.

19:37.217 --> 19:40.012
-[all gasping]
-Oh, my God, I had no idea.

19:40.095 --> 19:43.932
Mr. Peanutbutter, life is precious.
That's something you hear a lot in rehab.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.810
Hey, why'd you try to kill yourself,
you stupid idiot?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.478
-Um...
-I'm no psychiatrist,

19:48.562 --> 19:51.273
but it's probably because
he's such a sad dog!

19:51.356 --> 19:52.858
[gasps] Mr. Peanutbutter,

19:52.941 --> 19:55.277
we didn't realize
you have a mental illness.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.654
Thank you for getting the word out
about depression.

19:57.738 --> 20:02.409
You are truly a hero for destigmatizing
this all-too-common affliction.

20:02.492 --> 20:03.952
Yes, a hero!

20:04.036 --> 20:06.079
And to see more of this hero in action,

20:06.163 --> 20:09.291
tune in to "Birthday Dad" this spring
on MBN!

20:09.374 --> 20:10.584
Uh-huh.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.004
Mr. Peanutbutter, I think I sing
for everyone when I say...

20:19.885 --> 20:22.012
Oh, so I guess this all worked out.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.639
-Huh?
-Oh.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.934
-Depressingly, that is.
-[chuckles]

20:27.351 --> 20:28.936
[truck beeping]

20:30.062 --> 20:32.397
I saw your new assistant leave.
Why aren't you packed?

20:32.481 --> 20:34.066
I can't. Please don't make me.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.443
-You don't know what I'm like out there.
-Let's find out.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.570
-Hey, that's--
-I won't coddle this anymore.

20:38.820 --> 20:41.782
You're scared? Good.
Go to AA meetings. Go to a psychiatrist.

20:41.865 --> 20:43.325
But what pisses me off

20:43.408 --> 20:46.370
is when you take a bed that someone else
could be using to get better.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.205
Isn't it possible
I'm one of those people

20:48.288 --> 20:50.457
that would benefit
from staying here indefinitely?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.167
No. You're not that special.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.295
And you don't belong here anymore.
Pack your things.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.505
[huffs]

20:56.588 --> 20:58.924

Wow, look at you go.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.666
-You can't look at it yet!
-Okay, okay!

21:32.749 --> 21:34.876
Sorry. I was just kind of in it, you know?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.003
Yeah? It's going good?

21:36.211 --> 21:39.631
Yeah, you were right.
Once I got started, it was easy.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.926
So much of my career has been
writing for and about other people,

21:43.010 --> 21:44.720
and how terrible everything is.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.347
It's actually really refreshing
to just focus on myself, you know?

21:47.431 --> 21:51.560
Well, I don't want to interrupt your flow.
Please, write on.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.487
[Doctor Champ] Oh, this is a fine
how do you do.

22:02.779 --> 22:07.117
Brad was like, "It's difficult to have
a hot name, but not be that hot."

22:07.200 --> 22:09.619
Can you believe that?
He's extremely attractive, no?

22:09.703 --> 22:12.789
-I don't...
-And honestly, is Brad a hot name?

22:12.873 --> 22:14.207
-Brad Pitt, yes.
-Ugh.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.960
But like, name one other handsome Brad.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.420
-Bradley Cooper.
-Damn it!

22:18.503 --> 22:22.507
Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.
That was vodka you drank, not water.

I forgot how fun this is.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.186
-Just settle down, okay?
-Ah!

22:34.269 --> 22:36.355
You're gonna spend the night here
and sober up.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.566
Oh, so it's easy to be sober
all the sudden.

it's easy sober, hmm?

23:00.045 --> 23:01.671
Settle? Manzanita?

23:01.755 --> 23:05.258
I'd say that's about as likely
as my daughter Sabrina skipping school

in my work luggage!

Slight change of plans, though.

Sarah Lynn had to go home early.
So, we need to change the episode

23:19.689 --> 23:22.692
to being about you
not bringing Sabrina to the office.

23:22.776 --> 23:23.819
Is she okay?

23:23.902 --> 23:27.280
Uh, only reason I'm telling you this
is you're my main guy here,

23:27.364 --> 23:29.157
and I know you want
what's best for everyone.

23:29.241 --> 23:32.702
-Of course.
-Sarah Lynn got her hands on some alcohol.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.704
-Oh, my God.
-Her mother is apoplectic.

23:34.788 --> 23:35.789
She wants to sue.

I think it's just big talk,
but someone needs to be held accountable.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.294
And as the guys in charge here,

23:41.378 --> 23:45.006
we're responsible
for figuring out who that's gonna be.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.175
-What are you...
-I need you to be straight with me.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.053

-Oh, I don't...

23:50.137 --> 23:51.346
It wasn't, right?

-You get what I'm saying.
-Y-Yeah.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.229
So, you don't know
where she got the alcohol from?

23:59.312 --> 24:00.647
Yeah. I have no idea.

24:00.730 --> 24:04.067
Okay. But someone's gotta answer for this.

Well, don't look at me.
