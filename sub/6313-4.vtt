00:04.505 --> 00:05.506
I am proud of you.

00:05.590 --> 00:07.217
You have removed your laser weapon, huh?

00:07.300 --> 00:09.469
Weapon is to kill, disassemble, make dead.

00:09.552 --> 00:10.720
Unacceptable.

00:10.803 --> 00:13.890
You have made many modifications
upon your person, huh?

00:13.973 --> 00:16.768
You have come a long way
from the Defense Department prototype.

00:16.851 --> 00:17.977
You betcha.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.438
It's the all-new Johnny Five.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.939
Just look at these items.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.982
You look, but you do not see.

-I am from India.

-Got you covered, Injun. Ha!
-Oh!

00:33.534 --> 00:35.745
Ooh, somebody's having a party.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.289
Singh, you got any plastic wrap, man?

00:37.372 --> 00:40.083
Yeah, in the back, next to the onions.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.209
Wheeze the juice.

00:41.293 --> 00:43.002
No, no, no wheezing the juice.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.797
- Like I said, it was...
- 7-Eleven.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.217
Just be glad I did not buy
a turkey Slurpee.

02:02.582 --> 02:04.750
Do you recognize the girl
in this photo?

02:04.834 --> 02:08.254
I believe I remember her, yes.

02:08.338 --> 02:11.007
She was wearing a red sweater.

02:11.090 --> 02:12.925
I drove her to Penn Station.

02:13.009 --> 02:14.052
Is something wrong?

02:14.135 --> 02:15.428
Is she okay?

02:15.512 --> 02:16.929
She's dead.

02:17.013 --> 02:18.473
Her body was found in the magazine section

02:18.557 --> 02:19.558
of Barnes & Noble,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.976
propped up to look like she was reading.

My God.

Great job!

02:26.439 --> 02:27.940
Thanks so much for having me.

-What's up, dude?
-What's up, man?

02:33.821 --> 02:34.906
-How's it going?
-Chilling, man.

02:34.989 --> 02:37.534
Yo, watch out for the debris in there

02:37.617 --> 02:39.702
'cause I just destroyed that scene.

02:39.785 --> 02:42.038
Really?
The two lines for "unnamed cab driver"?

02:42.121 --> 02:44.583
Yeah, I crushed it, man.
How you been, dude? You look good.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.459
-Hey, do you work out?
-Not really.

02:46.543 --> 02:48.253
So my buddy Anush and I,

02:48.336 --> 02:50.338
we're really close on this pea protein.

02:50.422 --> 02:54.259
It's all natural, non-GMO, fully organic,

02:54.342 --> 02:57.720
Desi-owned, chickpea-based protein.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.514
It's called...

02:59.598 --> 03:00.723
Mumbai Muscle.

03:00.806 --> 03:04.436
A pea protein marketed just towards
the Indian weight-lifting community?

03:04.519 --> 03:05.520
Seems a little niche.

03:05.604 --> 03:07.606
If you call a billion Indians niche.

03:07.647 --> 03:08.856
Dude, I'm gonna go grab a coffee
at Marlow.

03:08.940 --> 03:09.815
You want to meet up?

03:09.899 --> 03:11.443
-Yeah, I'll come after this.
-Okay.

03:11.526 --> 03:12.818
Dev Shah?

03:12.902 --> 03:14.404
That's me.

03:14.487 --> 03:16.656
Okay, we have Dev Shah reading

03:16.739 --> 03:18.824
for the role of "unnamed cab driver."

03:18.908 --> 03:20.535
You ready to go?

03:20.619 --> 03:22.287
Yeah, I even took a cab over here
to research the role.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.039
I love that.

03:25.123 --> 03:26.416
Okay, let's begin.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.042
Jess?

03:28.126 --> 03:30.420
Do you recognize the girl in this photo?

03:31.671 --> 03:33.256
I believe I remember her, yes.

03:33.339 --> 03:34.382
I drove her to Penn Station.

03:34.466 --> 03:36.050
She had a red sweater.

03:36.134 --> 03:37.469
What's wrong? Is she okay?

03:37.552 --> 03:39.095
- She's dead.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.598
Her body was found in the magazine section
of Barnes & Noble,

03:41.681 --> 03:44.183
propped up to look like she was reading.

03:46.603 --> 03:48.771
My God.

03:48.854 --> 03:50.898
Okay. Thank you, Jess.

03:50.982 --> 03:54.193
I want to try it again, but this time,

03:54.277 --> 03:56.237
we need you to do an accent.

03:56.321 --> 03:57.905
You mean like an Indian accent?

03:57.989 --> 03:58.990
Yeah, yeah.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.617
Uh, you know, I'd rather not.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.201
I just feel kind of weird
doing that voice.

04:02.285 --> 04:03.244
Is that okay?

04:03.328 --> 04:06.038
You know, Ben Kingsley
did an accent in Gandhi,

04:06.122 --> 04:08.416
and he won the Oscar for it, so...

04:08.500 --> 04:11.210
But he didn't win the Oscar
just for doing the accent.

04:11.294 --> 04:15.298
I mean, it wasn't an Oscar
for Best Indian Accent.

04:15.381 --> 04:16.924
Also, might be strange
to play Gandhi

04:17.008 --> 04:19.511
and talk like I'm talking now.

04:19.594 --> 04:22.514
I would argue that the same
could be said of this cab driver.

04:22.597 --> 04:26.643
I would argue that
that's kind of a weird argument to make.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.145
Okay.

04:29.228 --> 04:31.814
We'll be in touch.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.107
Okay,

04:33.191 --> 04:34.859
but sounds like you won't be

04:34.942 --> 04:36.110
'cause of the whole accent thing.

04:36.194 --> 04:37.362
Yeah, no.

04:37.445 --> 04:38.904
Sorry.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.365
All right.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.741
Bye.

04:44.202 --> 04:45.495
So how'd it go?

04:45.578 --> 04:47.413
Um, I didn't get it.

04:47.497 --> 04:49.040
They wanted me to do an accent, so...

04:49.123 --> 04:51.000
What, you don't know how to do it?
It's super easy, man.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.085
I just do an impression
of my Uncle Madu.

04:53.169 --> 04:55.714
No, I know how to do it.
I just feel weird doing that voice.

04:55.796 --> 04:56.964
Do you always just do the accent?

04:57.048 --> 04:59.217
No, I don't always do it,
but it's a cab driver.

04:59.300 --> 05:01.469
I mean, I don't think it's a big deal.

05:01.553 --> 05:02.679
Yeah, but isn't it frustrating,

05:02.762 --> 05:05.640
so much of the stuff we go out for
is just stereotypes?

05:05.724 --> 05:08.476
Cab driver, scientist, IT guy.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.811
Yeah, but it's not all like that.
I mean, look at this.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.772
I just got this one today.

05:15.066 --> 05:17.527
"Pradeep, East Indian man
with a spiritual air,

05:17.610 --> 05:19.945
full of philosophical platitudes.

05:20.029 --> 05:21.531
He runs a convenience store,

05:21.614 --> 05:23.449
has a funny Indian accent."

05:23.533 --> 05:24.992
This is not a good example.

05:25.076 --> 05:26.578
Look, I get it.

05:26.661 --> 05:28.788
There probably is a Pradeep
who runs a convenience store,

05:28.871 --> 05:32.584
and I have nothing against him,
but why can't there be a Pradeep

05:32.667 --> 05:34.419
just once who's, like, an architect,

05:34.502 --> 05:37.422
or he designs mittens
or does one of the jobs

05:37.505 --> 05:39.215
Bradley Cooper's characters do in movies?

05:39.298 --> 05:40.508
Dude, I think about that too.

05:40.592 --> 05:42.719
I just can't wait for that. I got to work.

05:42.802 --> 05:44.596
And, look, in the meantime,
I can do good things

05:44.679 --> 05:46.180
with this Pradeep money.

05:46.264 --> 05:48.849
I mean, I can go donate money to charity.

05:48.933 --> 05:50.476
I can buy cool clothes.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.644
Well, at least they're actually

05:51.728 --> 05:53.396
getting Indian actors
to do those roles now

05:53.479 --> 05:55.147
and not going the Short Circuit 2 route.

05:55.231 --> 05:56.982
What's wrong with Short Circuit 2?

05:57.066 --> 05:59.444
They got a white guy
to play an Indian guy.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.320
What, the rob-- The robot movie?

06:01.404 --> 06:02.405
With Johnny Five?

06:02.488 --> 06:03.864
Wait, you don't know this?

06:03.948 --> 06:05.491
Wait, which Indian guy
are you talking about?

06:05.575 --> 06:06.743
Dude.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.832
-That guy's a white guy.
-The robot or the Indian?

06:12.915 --> 06:15.668
The Indian guy is a white guy.
That's Fisher Stevens.

06:15.752 --> 06:18.546
-They used brownface makeup.
-Wait, what?

06:18.630 --> 06:22.133
Yeah.
They got a real robot and a fake Indian.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.929
I'm sorry, man. I'm just...

06:27.012 --> 06:29.390
Wow, I'm experiencing
a lot of emotions right now.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.727
Man, that's, like,
one of my favorite Indian actors.

06:32.811 --> 06:35.146
Dude, it still happens.
You see The Social Network?

06:35.229 --> 06:37.816
Max Minghella plays an Indian guy.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.777
He's white. They browned him up.

06:40.860 --> 06:42.320
No, no. I read that he's 1/16 Indian.

06:42.403 --> 06:43.488
Who cares?

06:43.571 --> 06:44.905
If you go back far enough,
we're all 1/16 something.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.198
I'm probably 1/16 black.

06:46.282 --> 06:47.867
You think they're gonna let me play Blade?

06:47.950 --> 06:49.828
Did you go out for The Social Network?

06:49.910 --> 06:51.704
Dude, I got the worst agents, man.

06:51.788 --> 06:52.955
I mean, look. Those are extremes, right?

06:53.038 --> 06:54.332
There's stuff out there that's good,

06:54.415 --> 06:55.916
that's not stereotypes, you know.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.168
Are you going out for Three Buddies?

06:57.251 --> 06:58.377
Three Buddies? What is that?

06:58.461 --> 07:00.087
It's this new sitcom. It's open ethnicity.

07:00.171 --> 07:01.547
It's just three guys living in New York.

07:01.631 --> 07:03.633
-No accent, nothing.
-Can you forward that to me?

07:03.716 --> 07:05.718
-Sure.
-I've got to fire my agents.

07:05.802 --> 07:07.679
Oh, I just got a text from Anush.

07:07.762 --> 07:11.223
"I think Mumbai Muscle
might be causing me to lactate."

07:11.307 --> 07:13.017
This is-- Dude, this is, like, a code red.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.769
-I got to call him.
-Sure. Go. Go for it.

07:14.853 --> 07:16.020
Nush.

07:17.730 --> 07:19.148
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. Slow down.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.775
Are you sure it's milk?

07:20.859 --> 07:22.485
Well, dude,
don't worry about the investment.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.904
You got to get to the hospital.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.364
He's lactating.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.752
Hey, man,
is this business casual?

07:39.836 --> 07:41.962
Am I supposed to wear a coat?

07:42.046 --> 07:43.673
Do I look too casual?

07:44.674 --> 07:46.759
Hey, well, that's what you get
when you take a trip to the Bahamas.

07:46.843 --> 07:48.553
That was really great, Dev.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.596
-We'll be in touch.
-Thanks so much.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.473
-Dev.
-What up?

07:52.557 --> 07:54.559
Dude, thank you so much, man.

07:54.642 --> 07:56.728
-Good looking out.
-Of course.

07:56.811 --> 07:59.772
Hey, watch out for the debris in there.

07:59.856 --> 08:00.940
Yeah.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.274
Wait, what?

08:02.358 --> 08:04.694
I'm referencing what you said
the other day.

08:04.777 --> 08:06.195
About destroying the audition.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.739
Oh.

08:07.822 --> 08:09.407
Well, that interaction
didn't go as planned.

08:09.490 --> 08:10.616
Good luck, man.

08:10.700 --> 08:11.743
All right, man.

08:13.870 --> 08:16.205
Yo, so do y'all think we're gonna be
the first generation

08:16.288 --> 08:17.749
to experience the singularity?

08:17.832 --> 08:18.917
What's that?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.668
Carla was telling me about it last night.

08:20.752 --> 08:23.337
It's the idea of your mind
fusing with the Internet

08:23.421 --> 08:25.757
and computers
so man and machine become one.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.091
Oh, fuck!

08:27.174 --> 08:29.719
My agent just emailed me and said
I didn't get Three Buddies.

08:29.802 --> 08:32.012
Oh, man, I'm sorry. What happened?

08:32.096 --> 08:34.014
Okay, so just fuck my interesting topic,
then, I guess.

08:34.098 --> 08:35.349
Whoa.

08:35.433 --> 08:37.602
I think I accidentally got forwarded
an email chain.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.979
I'm not supposed to see this.

08:40.062 --> 08:43.482
The show creator says,
"Dev and Ravi are perfect."

08:43.566 --> 08:45.651
Then this executive Joan writes,
"Totally agree.

08:45.735 --> 08:47.779
Think we just found
our first two buddies!"

08:47.862 --> 08:50.907
Then this guy Jerry Danvers says,
"Both really great,

08:50.990 --> 08:52.199
but there can't be two."

08:52.283 --> 08:53.325
Can't be two?

08:53.409 --> 08:54.702
What, can't be two Indian guys?

08:54.786 --> 08:57.121
Isn't that kind of messed up?

08:57.204 --> 08:59.582
Yes, because of racism.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.459
This other person says,
"Who do you like better, Ravi or Dev?"

09:01.542 --> 09:04.044
He writes, "I don't know.
Let's meet them both

09:04.128 --> 09:06.756
and see who can curry our favor, hahaha."

09:06.839 --> 09:09.300
"Curry our favor"?
Are you fucking serious?

09:09.383 --> 09:12.386
Damn. Man, if that email got leaked,
that person would get fired.

09:12.470 --> 09:14.221
Mm, I don't know. Come on, Denise.

09:14.305 --> 09:17.224
People don't get that fired up
about racist Asian or Indian stuff.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.769
I feel like you only really risk
starting a brouhaha

09:19.852 --> 09:21.854
if you say something bad
about black people or gay people.

09:21.938 --> 09:23.856
I mean, if Paula Deen had said,

09:23.940 --> 09:25.524
"I don't want to serve Indian people,"

09:25.608 --> 09:26.651
no one would really care.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.152
They'd just go back to eating
the biscuits.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.946
Yeah, but Paula Deen
didn't get in trouble anyway.

09:30.029 --> 09:31.363
I mean, she gave some fake-ass apology

09:31.447 --> 09:32.907
and then went back to making fatty foods.

09:32.991 --> 09:35.493
True, but she did have
to apologize, right?

09:35.576 --> 09:37.578
Like, she had to go
meet with Al Sharpton.

09:37.662 --> 09:39.038
I mean, that's kind of
the punishment, right?

09:39.121 --> 09:42.082
You got to find Al Sharpton
and go have tea with him or whatever.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.292
We don't have a person like that.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.961
Like, who are you supposed to meet with?

09:45.044 --> 09:47.505
Deepak Chopra?
The Indian dude from No Doubt?

09:47.588 --> 09:48.714
Yeah, like, who's my guy?

09:48.798 --> 09:50.591
Steve Aoki? George Takei?

09:50.675 --> 09:51.926
He's busy with gay stuff.

09:52.010 --> 09:53.177
Who's my girl?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.637
Like, Oprah?

09:54.720 --> 09:56.055
Or Beyoncé?

09:56.138 --> 09:58.557
Oh, shit, I got the heavy hitters.
Never mind.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.893
You know, "curry our favor"
is pretty bad, though.

10:00.977 --> 10:03.145
I feel like that would be pretty awesome

10:03.228 --> 10:04.939
on a Huffington Post headline.

10:05.023 --> 10:06.315
I mean, I'd be intrigued.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.566
I'd click the shit out of that.

10:07.650 --> 10:08.943
Leak it, dude.

10:09.027 --> 10:11.278
Private racism becoming public racism

10:11.362 --> 10:13.865
that gets fools fired is so bomb.

10:13.948 --> 10:15.616
All right.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.702
I'll talk to my agent, see what we can do.

10:17.785 --> 10:18.995
That's your big idea?

10:19.078 --> 10:21.121
You're just gonna leak the email?

10:21.205 --> 10:23.207
What are you, a dummy?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.459
You've got Danvers by the balls.

10:25.543 --> 10:27.419
They've been calling my office all day

10:27.503 --> 10:30.339
trying to set up a meeting
so that he can sit down

10:30.422 --> 10:32.132
and apologize.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.425
Shannon, I don't want to go there

10:33.509 --> 10:36.220
and be the Indian Al Sharpton
and get some phony apology.

10:36.303 --> 10:39.557
I don't give a shit about the apology.

10:40.599 --> 10:44.144
I mean, I don't care about your feelings.

10:44.228 --> 10:48.440
If this meeting goes well,
you get the job, and it's a hit?

10:48.524 --> 10:51.402
I mean,
I could show you David Schwimmer's house

10:51.485 --> 10:55.364
if you need to see what's at stake here.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.782
I bet it's huge.

10:56.866 --> 10:59.284
He's made so much off Friends.

10:59.368 --> 11:01.161
Well, can't we get him
to cast me and Ravi?

11:01.245 --> 11:03.414
Ravi? Who the fuck is that?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.917
Is that the other Indian dude?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.378
I don't rep him.
Therefore, I don't give a fuck about him.

11:09.461 --> 11:12.172
You need to get your shit straight first.

11:12.256 --> 11:14.383
Don't get pissed about one racist email

11:14.466 --> 11:17.177
and let it ruin your career long-term!

11:17.261 --> 11:23.392
You know how much racist stuff
I've read about black people?

11:23.475 --> 11:25.561
Sexist stuff about women?

11:25.644 --> 11:28.064
If I forwarded all of those emails
and got people fired,

11:28.147 --> 11:29.523
I'd be working here by my damn self.

11:29.607 --> 11:30.733
Don't fuck this up!

11:32.651 --> 11:34.361
I'm trying to get this money, Dev.

11:34.445 --> 11:35.780
I'm trying to get this money,

11:35.863 --> 11:38.323
I'm trying to get this Friends money,
and you fucking it up.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.825
I'm not trying to fuck up
your Friends money.

11:39.909 --> 11:42.578
You better not fuck up my Friends money.

11:42.661 --> 11:44.371
Right over here.

11:44.455 --> 11:45.581
Quite a view.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.166
Yeah, it's a nice office, right?

11:47.249 --> 11:50.502
Much better than the spot I had
when I interned at Nickelodeon.

11:50.586 --> 11:54.506
I was just
watching your audition again this morning.

11:54.590 --> 11:57.051
"Damn!
That's where they put the baseball?"

11:57.135 --> 12:00.763
You, sir, are a funny man.

12:00.846 --> 12:03.348
Thanks. Appreciate it.

12:03.432 --> 12:04.934
All right, let's not beat around the bush.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.395
I am truly sorry for the email.

12:08.479 --> 12:13.109
It was a really stupid joke
I never should have made.

12:13.192 --> 12:15.277
Look, I'm happy to meet with you,

12:15.360 --> 12:17.863
but let's not kid ourselves.

12:17.947 --> 12:19.657
These apologies are always phony.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.867
You wrote that email.
You made your shitty joke.

12:21.951 --> 12:23.786
The only thing that's changed is,
I caught you,

12:23.869 --> 12:25.663
so we don't really need to do this.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.415
This is tough.
I mean, I don't know what to say.

12:28.499 --> 12:30.876
I wish you could just...

12:30.960 --> 12:32.294
get to know me a little bit better.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.131
I'm not who you think I am.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.884
You like the Knicks?

12:41.512 --> 12:42.554
Whoa!

12:47.309 --> 12:48.727
You ever sat courtside before?

12:48.811 --> 12:50.395
No, I do Go-Gurt commercials.

12:50.479 --> 12:51.939
I don't run a TV network.

12:52.023 --> 12:54.900
When I was a kid,
I used to love to go to Knicks games.

12:54.984 --> 12:56.944
Never thought I'd be sitting courtside.

12:57.028 --> 12:58.196
This is insane.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.405
I can't even believe
they let people sit this close.

13:00.489 --> 13:03.951
I mean, what's to stop Jerry Ferrara
from just tackling a player?

13:06.078 --> 13:07.746
-Hey, you hungry?
-Yeah.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.499
I got you. Hey, order of nachos here.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.844
What the fuck? Did you see that?

13:21.927 --> 13:23.846
That kid just ate one of my nachos.

13:23.929 --> 13:24.930
Are you serious?

13:25.014 --> 13:26.682
Yeah! He just ate one.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.559
Ugh, this kid is the worst.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.811
I would have given anything to do
something this cool when I was little.

13:30.895 --> 13:32.980
He's just sitting here on his phone.
Now he's stealing nachos.

13:33.064 --> 13:34.606
They got one of these kids at every game.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.316
-Courtside brats.
-You know what?

13:36.400 --> 13:37.985
-I'm gonna say something.
-Yeah, go get him.

13:38.069 --> 13:39.486
Hey.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.738
You take one of my nachos?

13:40.821 --> 13:41.989
Yeah.

13:42.073 --> 13:43.866
Those are my nachos.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.076
So? I wanted one.

13:45.159 --> 13:47.494
Yeah, but you can't just steal
people's nachos, okay?

13:47.578 --> 13:49.454
You realize how lucky you are?
You're 12 years old.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.040
You're sitting courtside at a Knicks game.

13:51.123 --> 13:52.666
You didn't earn this.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.211
I had to suffer
through a minor racial trauma to get here.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.296
All right, Sam.

13:57.379 --> 14:00.216
Looks like your dad's not gonna make it
to the game after all,

14:00.299 --> 14:02.718
but he says happy birthday,
and he'll see you at home.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.346
Hey, buddy.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.099
He said I can take you
to the toy store afterwards

14:08.182 --> 14:10.475
and buy you anything under $2,000.

14:10.559 --> 14:13.020
No, that's all right.
Let's just go home.

14:13.104 --> 14:15.689
Hey, hey.
Do you want the rest of the nachos?

14:15.773 --> 14:18.442
I'm sorry. Happy birthday.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.402
Oh, wait.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.280
Just one.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.826
I mean, come on.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.495
There's no way I could have known
that was his situation.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.372
You know what?

14:32.456 --> 14:33.999
Let's go check out the VIP suite.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.876
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.962
Hey, what do you say, buddy?

14:38.045 --> 14:39.421
-You thirsty?
-Yeah.

14:39.504 --> 14:41.299
All right, let's get you situated.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.841
Thank you, darling.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.426
-Here you go.
-Nice.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.304
-Oh, are you a seafood guy?
-Yes.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.597
All right, well, you got to
get your hands on this shrimp.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.308
-It's fantastic.
-Jerry Danvers.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.267
-Hey.
-My man.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.977
-There he is, Busta!
-How are you?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.603
-How are you, sir?
-Great. Good to see you.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.356
Hey, this is Dev Shah, hilarious actor.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.358
He's gonna be a big star any day.

14:59.441 --> 15:01.068
-Cool.
-How you doing, brother?

15:01.152 --> 15:02.194
Pleasure to meet you.

15:02.278 --> 15:03.862
Yeah, good to meet you too, Busta Rhymes.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.697
Hey, so what are you up to?

15:05.781 --> 15:08.159
Just finishing the album. Staying busy.

15:08.242 --> 15:10.119
As a matter of fact,
I just recently recorded

15:10.202 --> 15:12.579
a couple of tunes
that I need you to check out.

15:12.663 --> 15:13.998
How about we do some dinner next week?

15:14.081 --> 15:15.291
Yeah, for sure.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.959
-Hey, great to see you.
-Take care.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.210
Pleasure to meet you as well, brother.

15:18.294 --> 15:20.129
-Yeah, you too.
-All right, cool.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.301
All right.
How the fuck do you know Busta Rhymes?

15:25.384 --> 15:26.426
Oh, Trevor?

15:26.510 --> 15:28.220
Oh, I've known him for years.

15:28.304 --> 15:30.055
He and I are invested in the same company.

15:30.139 --> 15:32.850
They make high-end cell phone batteries.

15:32.933 --> 15:36.020
Listen, I got to say hi
to a colleague of mine.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.104
I'll see you in a bit.

15:37.188 --> 15:39.148
-All right. Do your thing.
-Yeah.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.034
Hey, excuse me, Bust.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.702
You mind if I ask you something
real quick?

15:51.785 --> 15:52.911
Yeah, what's up? Sure.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.789
- So you know Jerry a little bit, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.375
I might go into business with him--

15:57.457 --> 15:59.377
Oh, so you're getting ready to invest

15:59.459 --> 16:01.795
in the battery company as well, huh?

16:01.879 --> 16:03.172
I personally think you should,

16:03.255 --> 16:04.882
because you see this phone right here?

16:04.965 --> 16:07.343
I ain't have to charge this bitch
in the last six months.

16:07.426 --> 16:09.387
Shit is incredible.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.971
Yeah, wow, that's really impressive,

16:11.055 --> 16:13.057
but it's actually not
about the battery thing.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.808
It's an acting thing.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.435
He wants me to maybe
be in one of his shows,

16:16.518 --> 16:19.063
but, um, I saw this email he sent

16:19.146 --> 16:21.440
where he said something kind of racist.

16:21.565 --> 16:24.526
He may have been joking,
but I'm not really sure.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.861
What'd he say?

16:25.944 --> 16:30.115
He said that he wanted to see
if I could curry his favor.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.992
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
'Cause Indians eat curry?

16:32.076 --> 16:33.952
-Mm.
-I mean, that's some disrespectful shit.

16:34.036 --> 16:36.288
-Mm.
-Kind of fucked up, bro.

16:36.372 --> 16:37.497
Yeah.

16:37.581 --> 16:40.000
I mean, so he's bringing you to the game

16:40.084 --> 16:41.835
so he can butter you up.

16:41.919 --> 16:44.880
Looks like to me,
he's trying to curry your favor.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.048
That's what's up.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.759
So what do you think I should do?

16:48.842 --> 16:50.302
This is what I think.

16:50.386 --> 16:52.388
You know, you're a minority
trying to coming up in the game.

16:52.471 --> 16:54.348
You know, you got a rare opportunity,

16:54.432 --> 16:57.476
especially because you got the leverage
in this situation.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.020
I don't think
you should play the race card.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.939
Charge it to the race card.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.190
Feel me?

17:03.274 --> 17:05.109
-Yeah.
-Good.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.777
Good luck.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.612
I'm gonna fuck with some of this shrimp.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.613
Nice.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.906
Holla.

17:14.785 --> 17:15.827
So did you have fun?

17:15.911 --> 17:17.246
Oh, that was insane.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.165
Thank you so much for bringing me.

17:20.249 --> 17:23.294
Hey, can we be real for a second?

17:23.377 --> 17:25.504
Your email had a bad joke in it, right?

17:25.587 --> 17:27.005
I get it.

17:27.089 --> 17:28.882
You take anyone's emails or whatever

17:28.966 --> 17:30.134
and you put them under a microscope,

17:30.217 --> 17:32.386
you'll find something offensive.

17:32.470 --> 17:34.138
But, to me, the bigger issue is,

17:34.221 --> 17:37.308
why can't there be two Indian people
in the show?

17:37.391 --> 17:38.850
You know, why is it me or Ravi?

17:38.934 --> 17:40.478
Why can't there be two?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.062
Okay, look, I'll be frank with you.

17:42.146 --> 17:44.982
If I do a show with two Indian guys
on the poster,

17:45.065 --> 17:47.234
everyone's gonna think
it's an Indian show.

17:47.318 --> 17:50.570
It wouldn't be as, you know,
relatable to a large mainstream audience.

17:50.654 --> 17:53.031
Yeah, but you would never say that
about a show with two white people.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.992
Every show has two white people.
People don't say that.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.535
People don't watch True Detective and go,

17:56.618 --> 17:58.829
"Ooh, there's that white detective show."

17:58.912 --> 18:00.164
You know?

18:00.247 --> 18:02.500
But just to be clear, that's not me, okay?

18:02.582 --> 18:03.501
That's the public.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.336
Jerry Danvers, you know,

18:05.419 --> 18:08.422
would love to see two Indian people
on a show.

18:08.506 --> 18:10.841
Who cares? Right?

18:10.924 --> 18:14.845
But, you--
We're just not at that point.

18:14.928 --> 18:16.847
Well, what if we tried, you know,

18:16.930 --> 18:19.850
with me and Ravi,
and we just see what happens?

18:19.933 --> 18:21.143
Or...

18:21.226 --> 18:22.686
let's just put you in the show,

18:22.769 --> 18:25.147
make a hundred episodes,
get a huge syndication deal,

18:25.230 --> 18:27.691
and you make 50 to 75 million dollars

18:29.734 --> 18:31.320
Oh, shit.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.197
That's that Schwimmer money.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.493
-Yo!
-What's up?

18:37.576 --> 18:39.036
What up?

18:39.119 --> 18:41.330
I assume this jacked Indian dude
you brought is Anush?

18:41.413 --> 18:42.747
-'Sup?
-Yeah, man, hope you don't mind.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.666
-Brought Nush with me.
-Of course.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.460
The original Mumbai Muscles? I'm honored.

18:46.544 --> 18:48.504
Hope everything's okay
after the whole lactating scare.

18:48.587 --> 18:49.588
I'm good, man.

18:49.671 --> 18:52.799
So, man,
we got to talk a little business,

18:52.883 --> 18:53.925
if you don't mind giving us a little...

18:54.009 --> 18:55.010
No, that's cool, bro.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.470
I'll just do some burpees
over in the kitchen

18:56.554 --> 18:57.471
till you guys are done.

18:57.555 --> 18:58.638
Perfect.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.353
So talk to me.

19:04.436 --> 19:05.521
You sat down with Danvers?

19:05.604 --> 19:07.981
-Mm-hmm.
-What did he say?

19:08.065 --> 19:10.150
I brought up that whole
"there can't be two" thing,

19:10.234 --> 19:13.320
and honestly,
seems like he just wants one of us.

19:13.404 --> 19:16.532
They just don't want two Indian dudes
starring in a sitcom.

19:16.615 --> 19:18.325
What-- Why?

19:18.409 --> 19:20.118
Look, man,
Indians just aren't at that level yet.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.662
Yeah, there's more Indians popping up
every now and then,

19:22.746 --> 19:24.415
but we're like set decoration.

19:24.498 --> 19:26.083
We're not the ones doing the main stuff.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.792
We're not fucking the girls
and all that stuff.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.127
We're just not there yet.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.213
There can be one, but there can't be two,
you know?

19:31.296 --> 19:33.424
Black people just got
to "there can be two" status,

19:33.507 --> 19:34.674
you know?

19:34.758 --> 19:36.760
Even then, though, there can't be three,

19:36.843 --> 19:38.803
'cause then it's, like, a black show

19:38.887 --> 19:40.097
or a black movie.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.224
Indians, Asians, gays:

19:42.307 --> 19:44.768
there can be one, but there can't be two.

19:44.851 --> 19:48.897
But, you know,
there's two gay dudes in Will & Grace.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.608
No, just Sean Hayes. Jack.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.192
No, there's two gay dudes in that show.

19:52.276 --> 19:53.193
Who?

19:53.277 --> 19:55.028
Will! The lead dude.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.863
The show's about him. He's gay.

19:56.947 --> 19:58.282
Really?

19:58.365 --> 19:59.658
Guess I never saw the show.

19:59.741 --> 20:00.909
Wow, that was in the '90s.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.202
Props to Will & Grace team.

20:02.286 --> 20:03.870
Two gay dudes on Modern Family.

20:03.954 --> 20:05.830
All right, I get it!
There can be two gays, all right?

20:05.914 --> 20:07.791
Progress exists. Shout-out to gays.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.086
I'm sorry,
I got to stress eat or something.

20:11.169 --> 20:13.130
-You got any new pastas in there?
-Yeah, yeah.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.173
Bucatini. It's in the Tupperware.

20:15.257 --> 20:18.051
Watch out for that guanciale.
It's delicious.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.678
Ooh, what about this spaghetti?
Can I have this?

20:19.761 --> 20:20.845
That ain't spaghetti. That's bucatini!

20:20.929 --> 20:22.222
It's a thicker noodle, dummy.

20:22.306 --> 20:23.474
Yo, Nush, you want some spaghetti?

20:23.557 --> 20:24.600
Get those carbs away from me, man.

20:24.683 --> 20:25.725
You know it's my kryptonite.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.188
All right.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.815
Let's talk next steps.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.442
What are we thinking?

20:33.525 --> 20:35.026
Next steps? I don't know.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.778
I don't think
we can leak the email anymore.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.782
I'm just gonna say this:

20:40.865 --> 20:42.618
you're being a bit of an Uncle Taj.

20:42.701 --> 20:43.702
An Uncle Taj?

20:43.785 --> 20:44.911
Yeah, Uncle Tom, Uncle Taj.

20:44.995 --> 20:46.204
Oh, come on.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.665
Why would you be protecting this guy?

20:47.747 --> 20:48.957
Because he took you to a basketball game?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.668
Dude, I'm not protecting him. Look.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.918
He still wants to cast one of us.

20:52.002 --> 20:53.295
That'd be a huge deal.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.046
If one of us was on that show,

20:55.130 --> 20:59.259
playing an Indian character
that was well-rounded and had some depth,

20:59.343 --> 21:03.013
that isn't just some ethnic prop
that they cut to to just go,

21:03.096 --> 21:05.474
"Welcome
to the ," that's huge, okay?

21:05.557 --> 21:07.559
--Hold on.

21:07.643 --> 21:08.727
Oh, it's my agent.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.770
Hello?

21:10.854 --> 21:12.523
Hey, is there any update on Three Buddies?

21:12.606 --> 21:14.692
Yes, that's why I'm calling.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.984
Look, here's the latest.

21:16.067 --> 21:18.529
Danvers loves you, but look,

21:18.612 --> 21:20.071
he's going with somebody else.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.365
What? Who?

21:21.448 --> 21:23.158
Another Indian guy.

21:23.241 --> 21:25.536
Some stand-up comedian named Haymonth.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.912
I guess Danvers hadn't seen
all of the L.A. auditions,

21:27.996 --> 21:29.581
and he changed his mind.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.542
Are you fucking serious?
Another Indian dude?

21:31.625 --> 21:33.711
I'm sorry, man.
We'll find you something.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.671
Oh, I got an audition for you

21:35.754 --> 21:37.881
for a part on Blacklist

21:37.964 --> 21:40.967
for an Indian guy
who runs an Indian buffet

21:41.051 --> 21:42.844
where James Spader eats at.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.429
I don't want to do that shit!

21:44.513 --> 21:46.390
Yeah, I wouldn't do that shit either.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.474
All right, I'll call you later.

21:47.558 --> 21:48.600
All right, holla!

21:49.518 --> 21:51.353
What happened?

21:51.436 --> 21:53.605
They're casting some dude named Haymonth!

21:53.689 --> 21:56.024
Haymonth? Nush, you know a Haymonth?

21:56.107 --> 21:57.735
Nah, I don't know him, bro.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.027
Who the fuck is Haymonth?

21:59.110 --> 22:00.654
I don't know.
Some stand-up comic from L.A.

22:00.738 --> 22:02.489
-God!
-All right, fuck this dude.

22:02.573 --> 22:03.657
We're leaking the email.

22:03.741 --> 22:05.033
You know who we need to call?

22:05.116 --> 22:06.159
Nush's friend Prashanth.

22:06.243 --> 22:07.369
Yo, you remember Prashanth?

22:07.452 --> 22:08.537
Prashanth!

22:08.620 --> 22:10.247
Yo, Prashanth runs all the Indian stuff

22:10.330 --> 22:11.623
for this advocacy group.

22:11.707 --> 22:12.999
You remember that popchips commercial?

22:13.083 --> 22:14.626
Oh, you mean when the Kutch
went brownface?

22:14.710 --> 22:16.086
I remember that shit.

22:16.169 --> 22:17.921
These guys blew that thing wide open.

22:18.004 --> 22:22.342
Not only did the Kutch show up
to their office and apologize,

22:22.426 --> 22:24.428
he gave them a shit ton of popchips.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.763
Oh, popchips are great, man.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.847
They're like little popadams.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.016
Yeah. Let's do it.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.602
Let's get a bunch of Indian people

22:31.685 --> 22:33.437
tweeting all sorts of mean shit
at this dude.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.021
So should I switch to kettlebells,

22:35.105 --> 22:36.774
or are we making moves?

22:40.277 --> 22:41.612
Hey.

22:41.695 --> 22:42.946
You guys Dev and Ravi?

22:43.029 --> 22:44.406
Hey, what's up? Dev.

22:44.489 --> 22:45.490
-Great to meet you guys.
-I'm Ravi.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.701
I'm Rick Romero.
I'm the director here at the center.

22:47.785 --> 22:49.160
I'm so glad you guys got in touch with us.

22:49.244 --> 22:50.829
We'd love to help you out.

22:50.912 --> 22:54.207
But, um, listen, some bad news.

22:54.291 --> 22:57.043
We actually
had to let Prashanth go recently.

22:57.127 --> 22:58.420
Oh, that sucks.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.422
There just wasn't enough Indian stuff
coming in,

23:00.505 --> 23:02.841
and he was just kind of
sitting around a lot.

23:02.924 --> 23:05.885
Good for Indians in general,
bad for that specific Indian.

23:07.929 --> 23:10.014
Still on the to-do list, huh, Redskins?

23:10.098 --> 23:12.643
Oh, yeah, man,
I don't know what else to do.

23:12.726 --> 23:14.603
That's been on the docket since,
like, '94.

23:14.686 --> 23:17.564
Yeah, seems like it should have been
one phone call, right?

23:17.648 --> 23:19.775
"Hey, that's a racial slur.
You mind changing that?"

23:19.858 --> 23:21.610
"No! Not at all."

23:21.693 --> 23:23.903
Yeah, I got pretty cocky last year
when it got some traction.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.323
I even made a mock-up.

23:27.574 --> 23:29.117
Cool.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.661
What is that?

23:30.744 --> 23:32.996
This is my pitch for what
they should change the name to:

23:33.079 --> 23:35.499
the Washington Breadsticks.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.875
Is this real? Are you serious?

23:36.958 --> 23:38.918
Yeah, I mean, it sounds like Redskins.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.546
Listen closely. Breadsticks. Redskins.

23:41.630 --> 23:42.881
Breadsticks. Redskins.

23:42.964 --> 23:44.424
It just makes sense.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.677
Yeah, I don't know if it does.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.011
It doesn't, no.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.890
What is the best way for us
to stir shit up about Danvers?

23:51.973 --> 23:54.267
-Yeah.
-Oh, we've done this kind of thing before.

23:54.351 --> 23:56.978
The first move is a press release from us,

23:57.061 --> 24:00.148
followed by an email blast
to our entire user base.

24:00.231 --> 24:02.192
How many people are in the user base?

24:02.275 --> 24:04.820
Forty thousand, and trust me,

24:04.903 --> 24:07.238
they get pissed about anything.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.574
Can I just say something real quick?

24:12.703 --> 24:16.874
Um... these are baguettes.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.958
These are mozzarella sticks.

24:20.878 --> 24:22.671
Where are the fucking breadsticks?

24:24.339 --> 24:26.800
Hey, cheers, man.

24:26.884 --> 24:28.385
Yeah, to me screwing myself over

24:28.468 --> 24:30.053
and possibly never working again.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.222
No. Hey, you are a hero, man.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.765
You're doing this for the greater good.

24:33.849 --> 24:35.851
To the greater good and to Johnny Five.

24:35.934 --> 24:38.019
-He's alive.
-And to Bobby Jindal.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.563
I think that dude's got a chance.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.357
I disagree
with literally everything he says, but...

24:42.440 --> 24:43.734
nice to see a brown guy out there.

24:43.817 --> 24:45.861
Yeah.

24:50.574 --> 24:52.033
Hey, Shannon. What's up?

24:52.116 --> 24:55.328
So... interesting development.

24:55.412 --> 24:57.372
Danvers is dead.

24:57.455 --> 24:58.373
What?

24:58.456 --> 25:00.083
He had a heart attack.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.335
I don't think you should leak that email.

25:02.419 --> 25:03.628
Are you serious?

25:03.712 --> 25:05.296
Yes, I'm serious.

25:05.380 --> 25:07.632
That would be a very fucked-up
practical joke if I wasn't.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.426
Look, things are happening fast.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.261
Joan Erickson is the new head,

25:11.344 --> 25:13.346
and they're deciding on pilots this week,

25:13.430 --> 25:16.433
and they're wanting to meet with you
tomorrow.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.560
All right, let me call you back later.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.562
It's time to get this Friends money.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.146
Okay? Bye.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.314
Dude, what happened?

25:23.398 --> 25:25.483
You get a callback on that Arby's spot?

25:25.567 --> 25:27.986
Holy shit.

25:28.069 --> 25:29.863
Jerry Danvers is dead.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.783
Wait, but is it the same Jerry Danvers?

25:32.866 --> 25:34.409
Yes, Ravi,

25:34.492 --> 25:38.413
the only Jerry Danvers relevant
to our situation, that one,

25:38.496 --> 25:39.748
is dead.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.499
He had a heart attack.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.084
Damn.

25:46.129 --> 25:47.547
But that's how we roll, dog.

25:47.631 --> 25:50.049
Those racist motherfuckers die,
and we take over!

25:51.635 --> 25:52.552
Yeah.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.137
A guy just died.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.264
I'm not giving you a high five.

25:59.309 --> 26:01.770
First off,
I just want to say I'm so sorry

26:01.853 --> 26:03.521
to hear about Mr. Danvers.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.064
Thank you for saying that.

26:05.148 --> 26:06.274
We all miss him.

26:06.357 --> 26:08.067
It's been a rough couple days.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.903
I can't even imagine.

26:09.987 --> 26:12.906
Now, I wanted to meet with you because,
while we loved Jerry,

26:12.990 --> 26:15.033
he was a little bit more conservative
in his style

26:15.116 --> 26:16.159
than the rest of us.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.368
For example, Three Buddies.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.871
That was his show. He loved it.

26:19.955 --> 26:22.332
The rest of us thought
it was a little bit too traditional,

26:22.415 --> 26:24.167
so we won't be moving forward with it.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.878
Oh, that sucks.

26:26.962 --> 26:29.380
Well, if you didn't want to meet with me
about Three Buddies,

26:29.464 --> 26:30.882
what did you want to chat about?

26:30.966 --> 26:33.176
I'm a huge fan of you and Ravi both.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.762
I saw Jerry's emails,
and I started thinking,

26:35.846 --> 26:37.555
"You know,
why can't there be two Indian actors

26:37.639 --> 26:39.057
on one network show?"

26:39.140 --> 26:41.643
I mean, that's ridiculous and offensive.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.144
I want to do a show
with you and Ravi both.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.646
I think there can be two.

26:44.729 --> 26:46.773
Yes!
That's what I've been screaming, boo!

26:46.857 --> 26:47.983
Let's do it!

26:48.066 --> 26:49.609
Now that I'm in charge,

26:49.693 --> 26:52.904
I want to focus on
fresh and innovative ideas.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.405
I'm all about that.

26:54.489 --> 26:57.200
So I just bought the rights
to Perfect Strangers.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.785
-Huh?
-I want to do a complete reboot.

26:58.869 --> 27:00.453
And I want you and Ravi both.

27:00.537 --> 27:02.706
Think about it:
one character is an Indian man.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.165
He was born and raised in America

27:04.248 --> 27:05.834
and totally assimilated.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.837
And then his cousin comes from India
and has to stay with him.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.463
It's a fish-out-of-water story.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.425
Okay.

27:14.509 --> 27:16.511
Um...

27:16.594 --> 27:18.680
yeah, that could be interesting.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.307
I think you'd be perfect for Srikumar,
the immigrant.

27:21.391 --> 27:23.060
You're willing to do an accent, right?

27:23.142 --> 27:24.102
Wait, what?

27:24.185 --> 27:26.646
Well, we cast Ravi
as the American guy, Darren.

27:26.730 --> 27:28.899
He refused to do an accent
to play Srikumar.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.817
He seemed pretty adamant about it.

27:30.901 --> 27:33.737
So he's Larry,
and you want me to be Balki?

27:33.820 --> 27:35.446
Like, I'm Indian Balki?

27:35.530 --> 27:37.490
Yeah. Isn't this great?

27:37.574 --> 27:39.701
Well, let's reboot another one
of the TGIF shows.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.119
What about Family Matters?

27:41.202 --> 27:42.495
I could be an Indian cop.

27:42.579 --> 27:43.747
You never see an Indian cop

27:43.830 --> 27:45.206
in real life or on TV.

27:45.289 --> 27:47.166
That's groundbreaking.

27:47.250 --> 27:48.752
Why won't you do an accent?

27:48.835 --> 27:50.211
I don't want to play a stereotype.

27:50.294 --> 27:51.504
It's offensive.

27:51.588 --> 27:52.714
But you've done it so many times.

27:52.797 --> 27:56.093
Your IMDb page is a list
of Indian stereotypes:

27:56.175 --> 28:01.098
gas station clerk, IT guy,
guy in crowd with Indian accent.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.141
I get a shot at the Schwimmer money,

28:03.224 --> 28:04.768
and now you get a conscience?

28:04.851 --> 28:06.310
That was the old Ravi, okay?

28:06.394 --> 28:08.772
That was
before the Short Circuit 2 revelation!

28:08.855 --> 28:10.648
What's wrong with Short Circuit 2?

28:16.863 --> 28:18.740
That's a white actor.

28:18.823 --> 28:20.199
They used brownface makeup.

28:20.283 --> 28:22.619
Like the popchips commercial?

28:25.830 --> 28:27.582
Is Mindy Kaling real?

28:30.085 --> 28:37.092
