I'm not happy.

03:04.437 --> 03:06.199
Yeah, I can tell.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.707
You haven't said two flippin' words to me.

03:13.177 --> 03:15.013
Are you still mad?

03:15.047 --> 03:17.481
You know, I'm more disturbed, Keith.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.616
To be fair...

03:20.412 --> 03:22.589
I wasn't even sexually aroused.

03:22.607 --> 03:24.263
What difference does that make, man?

03:24.299 --> 03:25.870
It's a big difference whether or not

03:25.909 --> 03:28.592
- you're regular or sexually aroused.
- Jesus, Keith.

03:28.805 --> 03:31.995
Look, Ryan, I didn't
mean to disrespect you,

way in front of Lisa.

seeing your parents today?

03:49.622 --> 03:50.800
I think...

I think that they're
gonna be happy to see you.

They're gonna want to
visit you all the time.

04:14.674 --> 04:16.541
Your pecker.

04:16.661 --> 04:20.581
See, everybody saw it when
you flashed Ryan's girl.

04:20.882 --> 04:25.045
You know, I heard that it's like...

04:25.165 --> 04:28.401
a baby bird in a nest.

04:28.420 --> 04:31.531
Just a tiny little thing.

04:59.585 --> 05:01.952
[Breathing heavily]

05:02.383 --> 05:05.008
It's because I wasn't aroused.

I didn't tell you to go take a day trip

05:55.464 --> 05:56.616

05:56.643 --> 05:59.058
Do you think this is
what I want to do today?

Do you have any fucking
idea what I'm walking into?

06:01.993 --> 06:04.947
Oh, no, you don't,
because you weren't there.

06:04.981 --> 06:07.234
You wanted me to help him
and this is what he needs,

were living in Huntington.

and we had this cute,
little place on Speedway.

10:24.178 --> 10:29.063
Well, anyway, you were
delivered at Saint Joseph's

because we had to move to North Hollywood

10:31.036 --> 10:32.569
when I was eight months pregnant

10:32.604 --> 10:35.673
so your dad could train some Armenian guy.

- Ooh!

it was Huntington for some reason.

you're from the Valley.

11:33.671 --> 11:35.639
Since I started catching
people in triangles.

You fought with a busted hand,
you went up a weight class.

11:38.054 --> 11:39.159
I mean, that's big-boy shit.

11:39.173 --> 11:40.586
Most of these pros wouldn't do that.

of something big for you.

13:04.793 --> 13:06.549
- In a fight?
- No.

13:06.669 --> 13:09.081
Jay and I were messing around.

13:09.201 --> 13:11.324
He fell back on me,

13:11.358 --> 13:13.393
and now I've got a bone floating around.

13:13.427 --> 13:15.929
Well, are they giving you
something for the pain at least?

13:15.963 --> 13:17.330
I'm fine.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.664
No, you should have something.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.035
Dr. Diaz: All right, Nate. You ready to go?

13:22.069 --> 13:24.183
Hello. I don't think we've met.

13:24.210 --> 13:26.341
Christina. I'm Nate's mother.

13:26.369 --> 13:28.244
Oh. I'm Dr. Diaz.

13:28.289 --> 13:30.108
I'm gonna be taking over for Tatiana.

13:30.704 --> 13:32.241
What happened with Tatiana?

13:32.286 --> 13:33.402
She mess something up?

13:33.522 --> 13:34.698
[Chuckles] No, it's nothing like that.

13:34.727 --> 13:36.008
We rotate our therapists.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.109
And since Nate is nearing
the end of his treatment,

13:38.160 --> 13:40.048
I thought I'd just finish things up myself.

13:40.852 --> 13:43.255
Well, I hope you know
he's in a lot of pain.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.572
He has sciatica, so whatever
you can do for that...

13:45.806 --> 13:47.789
Okay. We'll have a look.

13:53.759 --> 13:55.012
Uh, excuse me, Miss?

13:55.057 --> 13:56.429
I'm looking for something that says

13:56.475 --> 13:58.953
"I just got out of prison,
please stop hating me,"

13:58.981 --> 14:00.636
- but it can't be romantic.
- Ryan.

14:00.663 --> 14:01.790
You have something like that?

14:01.819 --> 14:02.661
I got this.

14:02.690 --> 14:04.797
She's got it. Never
mind. Just keep spritzing.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.083
You're funny.

14:08.537 --> 14:09.641
You smiled.

14:09.846 --> 14:10.893
I said you're funny.

14:10.929 --> 14:13.190
What, do you need me to
shower you with roses?

14:14.244 --> 14:15.759
[Cellphone vibrates]

14:18.262 --> 14:19.462
It's fucking Keith.

14:19.582 --> 14:22.322
He's having trouble with
one of the residents.

14:22.352 --> 14:25.022
You mind if I grab this real quick?

14:25.142 --> 14:26.730
What's up, Keith?

14:26.764 --> 14:28.227
Keith: Hey, um, R... is this a bad time?

14:28.248 --> 14:29.851
It's a very bad time,
Keith, but what's going on?

14:29.873 --> 14:30.714
Everything okay?

14:30.736 --> 14:32.543
Well, not really.

14:32.785 --> 14:35.920
I can't find my flip-flops.

14:37.087 --> 14:39.743
You're calling me because you
can't find your flip-flops?

14:39.777 --> 14:42.187
- I'm... but... yes.
- Okay.

14:42.307 --> 14:44.529
Keith, you remember when
I told you not to call me

14:44.565 --> 14:46.416
unless it was important,
it was an emergency?

14:46.450 --> 14:47.360
Yes.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.620
- This is not a fucking emergency, Keith.
- I know. Right.

14:49.629 --> 14:51.430
But I'm... I fear that

14:51.431 --> 14:56.359
this may be a prelude to
an emergency because if...

14:56.553 --> 14:58.261
you know, what if Michael's behind this

14:58.295 --> 15:00.293
and he's setting me up for something worse,

15:00.331 --> 15:01.664
like, way worse, though?

15:01.784 --> 15:04.684
I think you're looking way too
deeply into this, pal. Just... just

15:05.022 --> 15:06.677
keep looking around for them,

15:06.703 --> 15:09.605
and if... if anything
escalates, then call me, okay?

15:10.107 --> 15:11.822
Okay. Um...

15:11.845 --> 15:13.884
I got to go. Bye. Wait, Keith.

15:14.004 --> 15:15.585
Stay off my fucking bed.

15:15.612 --> 15:17.713
Keith, are you on my bed?

15:18.146 --> 15:20.082
I was earlier, but I'm not now.

15:20.116 --> 15:21.896
Get off my bed.

15:21.924 --> 15:23.936
Ryan, wait.

15:26.241 --> 15:28.557
He always hangs up first.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.341
It's both our beds.

15:36.623 --> 15:38.187
Alvey: Point is, I should have pushed

15:38.307 --> 15:41.461
the police harder to look into
these two Mexicans and I didn't.

15:41.461 --> 15:43.238
We're not gonna let these
motherfuckers slide, though,

15:43.260 --> 15:44.973
but we can't do anything stupid, either.

15:45.007 --> 15:46.955
Okay? You understand?

15:48.077 --> 15:50.767
Cops know about them now
and we'll let them handle it.

15:50.796 --> 15:51.981
Till they don't.

15:52.164 --> 15:53.972
Yeah, you're right. You
know, I don't want Nate

15:54.023 --> 15:55.584
worrying about what I'm gonna do.

15:55.618 --> 15:57.618
Kid needs his peace.

16:01.123 --> 16:01.955
What?

16:02.075 --> 16:05.131
I don't know, man. It's fucking
disturbing when you're so reasonable.

16:05.159 --> 16:06.494
I don't trust you.

16:07.976 --> 16:09.897
I don't trust you, either.

16:11.415 --> 16:12.165
Two more?

16:12.210 --> 16:13.857
- Let's do it.
- Sweetheart.

[Groans]

16:15.046 --> 16:16.190
Dr. Diaz: How's that feel?

16:16.729 --> 16:18.458
- Better.
- You're gonna make him vomit.

16:18.482 --> 16:19.858
- He needs water.
- Mom.

16:19.887 --> 16:20.835
Okay, look. Let's stop.

16:20.876 --> 16:22.298
I got it. Good job.

- Here.
- [Sighs]

16:27.775 --> 16:29.037
Here, drink this.

16:29.157 --> 16:31.809
So, the good news is, his knee is stable.

16:31.929 --> 16:33.775
So right now it's all about
developing his strength

16:33.811 --> 16:35.122
and his lateral movement.

16:35.156 --> 16:36.170
Did he tell you

16:36.189 --> 16:38.339
he has a piece of his
pelvis floating around?

16:38.366 --> 16:40.260
Uh, yes. Yes, ma'am, he did.

16:40.296 --> 16:42.354
And we are looking at that very closely.

16:42.382 --> 16:44.311
Well, it's causing him
a great deal of pain,

16:44.329 --> 16:46.140
and I don't think it's a bad
idea if he has some relief.

16:46.168 --> 16:47.533
He knows.

16:47.567 --> 16:49.517
You know, what always works for me is, uh,

16:49.534 --> 16:50.676
is just a nice, hot bath,

16:50.796 --> 16:52.744
- couple scoops of epsom salts...
- Salt?

16:53.603 --> 16:57.178
We are talking about a
free-floating shard of bone

16:57.215 --> 16:58.869
and you think salt's gonna do the trick?

16:58.905 --> 17:00.980
Can you even write a prescription?

17:02.110 --> 17:03.463
I can.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.220
Got my own pad and everything.

17:05.445 --> 17:07.671
Hey, great job today.
Keep up the good work.

- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

Nah. Joe Daddy's got it under
control, Ryan's with Lisa.

18:09.485 --> 18:12.028
Not much going on.

18:12.672 --> 18:14.452
I saw him leave here earlier.

18:36.696 --> 18:38.296
Let me ask your advice on something.

18:39.477 --> 18:41.965
I got tons of that to give.

18:42.294 --> 18:44.601
What do I got to do to
fix things with Nate?

18:44.636 --> 18:46.054
Give him up for adoption.

18:46.061 --> 18:47.656
Oh, fuck you. I'm asking you for real.

18:47.776 --> 18:49.331
I can't... I can't get through to him.

- I got it. I got it.
- Jay: One thing. No.

- Maybe his favorite food? Favorite color?
- I got it.

- I got it.
- What shirt he likes to wear?

he talks to me, either.

opens up just a fucking crack.

23:36.452 --> 23:40.655
and then meat goes on the bottom

All right. I'll close my eyes.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.659
Ryan, when can I open my eyes?

39:38.694 --> 39:40.064
Open them, man.

39:41.299 --> 39:43.065
Oh.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.741
Thanks.

39:51.039 --> 39:52.778
- [Sighs]
- What, you don't like it?

39:52.898 --> 39:54.508
No, it's...

39:56.199 --> 39:57.717
Last time...

39:58.275 --> 40:00.315
I got a bear from someone,

40:00.435 --> 40:01.915
my mom was murdered.

40:03.681 --> 40:05.346
- Oh...
- Can I...

40:05.386 --> 40:07.349
- I don't need another bear.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:07.469 --> 40:08.922
This is a perfectly good...

40:08.968 --> 40:10.650
- this is a perfectly good bear.
- Totally. I'm sorry.

40:10.686 --> 40:12.653
I don't even know what I was
thinking, man. I'm so sorry.

40:12.893 --> 40:14.960
- It's okay.
- It's stupid, man.

40:14.995 --> 40:17.096
I'll get rid of it, man.

40:30.911 --> 40:33.395
You didn't ever have a bear, did you?

40:34.414 --> 40:36.015
No.

40:45.836 --> 40:47.632
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:51.637 --> 40:53.372
How'd it go?

40:53.720 --> 40:56.144
I don't know. I couldn't tell.

40:56.171 --> 40:58.843
His dad forgave him, whatever that means.

41:00.259 --> 41:02.336
How many of those have you had?

41:02.456 --> 41:04.229
These?

41:04.750 --> 41:06.785
Just one.

41:07.220 --> 41:10.121
[Yawns]

41:10.155 --> 41:12.290
[Shoes thud]

41:13.285 --> 41:15.293
[Sighs]

41:20.966 --> 41:23.734
Christina's back.

41:25.870 --> 41:28.405
I saw her over at the boys' house tonight.

41:31.542 --> 41:33.243
What does she want?

41:36.715 --> 41:38.882
She's gonna stay with them.

41:42.490 --> 41:44.754
I don't know for how long.

41:45.888 --> 41:47.553
Fuck.

41:56.667 --> 41:58.768
<i>[Rock music playing]</i>

[Chuckles]

42:13.379 --> 42:15.518
Sorry I'm late, guys.

42:25.837 --> 42:28.164
Well, you two are awfully quiet.

42:31.267 --> 42:33.935
Are you boys fighting?

42:33.970 --> 42:37.072
Nope. We're cool.

42:41.769 --> 42:43.845
Something's weird.

42:43.965 --> 42:45.529
Gloves.

42:45.566 --> 42:46.874
Say it again?

42:46.994 --> 42:48.616
Gloves.

42:48.651 --> 42:50.852
You have to wear gloves
when you work in the kitchen.

42:50.889 --> 42:52.581
Oh, shit, that's right.

42:52.701 --> 42:54.689
Fah. Bonehead.

43:05.433 --> 43:07.157
So, Ryan,

43:07.431 --> 43:09.718
how's your dad doing?

43:12.834 --> 43:13.923
Yeah.

43:14.043 --> 43:17.144
Heard you guys hung out
earlier, so I was just...

43:17.179 --> 43:19.630
Was that cool? Was that fun?

43:22.200 --> 43:23.334
Yeah.

43:27.222 --> 43:28.455
It was great.

43:33.462 --> 43:35.210

Drop it. Drop it.

43:42.252 --> 43:44.686
- Why'd you do that?
- He was after you.

43:44.806 --> 43:45.784
Jesus.

43:45.829 --> 43:47.348

Do exactly what I say, okay?

Okay.

44:06.902 --> 44:08.923
Don't fucking touch this knife, okay?
