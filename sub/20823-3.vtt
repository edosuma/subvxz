00:16.047 --> 00:18.615
Prescription Goggles over
to Sweaty Headband Guy!

00:18.640 --> 00:20.859
He passes it to Anakin Skywalker

00:20.884 --> 00:23.284
who drives the lane...

00:23.309 --> 00:25.578
Come on, ref! How can you not see that?!

00:25.619 --> 00:27.016
What happened?

00:27.141 --> 00:30.405
- Skywalker got fouled. No call.
- His name's Josh.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.951
What's the matter, ref? Are you blind?!

00:32.976 --> 00:35.726
My god. Jules, I'm so sorry.

00:35.751 --> 00:38.117
- I didn't mean...
- It's OK. Dad, this is.

00:38.142 --> 00:40.866
Miss Sinclair, my social studies
teacher. Mr. Shade, please forgive me.

00:40.890 --> 00:43.304
I get overexcited when we play Hartwell.

00:43.336 --> 00:45.314
In the three years I've been
teaching here, we've never

00:45.338 --> 00:47.858
won against them. I can see why.
These guys are good.

00:47.883 --> 00:49.422
Are you here to support Liam, Jules?

00:49.447 --> 00:52.745
Not just Liam. How's he doing, Dad?

00:52.770 --> 00:55.306
Good job, guys, good job. Let's go!

00:56.291 --> 00:58.726
His effort

00:58.751 --> 01:00.550
is off the charts, honey.

01:00.595 --> 01:02.967
- Mr. Shade.
- Principal Frame!

01:02.992 --> 01:04.941
Nice to see you again.

01:05.343 --> 01:07.988
- Can we speak in private?
- Sure...

01:08.013 --> 01:10.325
- Jules, you'll be OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:10.921 --> 01:13.328
Come on, ref! He's traveling!

01:13.353 --> 01:15.987
Yeah, ref. Even I could see that!

01:17.663 --> 01:19.718
Please take a seat.

01:19.823 --> 01:21.858
Only back at school an hour and already

01:21.883 --> 01:24.022
called in to the
principal's office. Ha ha!

01:24.047 --> 01:26.396
I understand you're now
a private investigator.

01:26.421 --> 01:28.219
A situation has come to my attention

01:28.244 --> 01:29.771
that requires a great
deal of discretion.

01:29.795 --> 01:31.477
Happy to help. Especially

01:31.502 --> 01:34.762
if it means lower tuition for Jules. Ha!

01:36.477 --> 01:39.512
I received this anonymous
email this afternoon.

01:41.734 --> 01:44.459
Studentstud2000! "Miss S",

01:44.484 --> 01:46.527
"I can't stop thinking
about last night."

01:46.701 --> 01:48.851
"That was just the beginning.
Next time"

01:48.876 --> 01:51.677
"we're alone, I'm gonna
teach you how to..." Wow!

01:51.702 --> 01:53.391
It goes on in some detail.

01:53.416 --> 01:56.455
The message indicates this
event took place last Thursday.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.398
Wait, is...
this between a student and a teacher?

02:00.721 --> 02:02.366
Who's Mary?

02:02.391 --> 02:04.679
Mary Sinclair. She
teaches social studies.

02:04.704 --> 02:07.441
- Jules' teacher? From the game?
- She's highly respected.

02:07.466 --> 02:09.757
And a close friend.
She would never do anything like this.

02:09.782 --> 02:12.443
Protocol dictates

02:12.468 --> 02:14.547
that I should report this to
the Ellard board immediately,

02:14.571 --> 02:17.834
but I can't do that to Mary.
An allegation like this...

02:17.859 --> 02:20.226
Even a false one...
Can ruin a teacher's career.

02:20.251 --> 02:22.051
And destroy a school's reputation.

02:22.953 --> 02:24.788
I need you to prove

02:24.813 --> 02:27.624
that this is a prank,
in poor taste, before it turns

02:27.649 --> 02:30.328
into a scandal. But you'll need
to act quickly, and quietly.

02:30.353 --> 02:32.830
Alright, I'm on it, Ms. Frame.

02:32.855 --> 02:34.828
And don't worry,
my partner and I will be in and out

02:34.852 --> 02:37.386
before this thing explodes in your face.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.077
That came out wrong.

03:16.545 --> 03:18.858
All I said was Liam
played a respectable game.

03:18.883 --> 03:20.928
Yeah, and I can tell when
you're fakeliking Liam.

03:20.953 --> 03:23.520
You do that thing where you
laugh while you're talking.

03:23.545 --> 03:26.539
- I don't do that!
- Welcome home, kiddo.

03:26.564 --> 03:29.365
- Grandpa!
- How was school?

03:29.390 --> 03:31.490
Good.
Dad got sent to the principal's office.

03:31.515 --> 03:33.920
That takes me back. What happened?

03:33.945 --> 03:35.983
Principal Frame
just wants me to speak

03:36.008 --> 03:37.983
to some of the students. About what?

03:38.008 --> 03:40.631
Success. Chasing your
dreams. Aiming for the moon,

03:40.656 --> 03:42.850
so when you miss you'll
land amongst the stars.

03:42.875 --> 03:45.810
- Please don't embarrass me.
- I'm sure it'll be brief.

03:45.835 --> 03:49.053
- Dinner's on the table, sweetie.
- Thanks.

03:49.410 --> 03:52.910
- Speak to the students? Really?
- What? It could happen.

03:52.935 --> 03:55.920
OK, fine. Principal
Frame hired me and Angie

03:55.945 --> 03:58.116
- to look into something for her.
- You don't think she'll realize

03:58.140 --> 04:00.022
something's up when you and
Angie start poking around?

04:00.046 --> 04:02.129
It involves her favourite teacher.
I just don't want

04:02.154 --> 04:03.922
anything to ruin how much
she loves that place.

04:03.946 --> 04:06.163
Then just don't be the
one that does the ruining.

04:06.188 --> 04:09.319
- Dad, I got this.
- OK.

04:14.389 --> 04:16.397
Yeah, I'm up. See you in 5, Shade.

04:22.083 --> 04:24.108
Whoever you are...

04:24.133 --> 04:27.476
stand up slowly with
your hands in the air.

04:29.999 --> 04:33.358
- Zoe?
- My god, it's you.

04:33.437 --> 04:35.280
I thought for sure I
was about to get shot.

04:35.305 --> 04:37.816
- What are you doing here?
- I... work for you.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.544
Today's my first day.

04:41.108 --> 04:44.021
- I didn't expect you so early.
- I wanted to get a head start

04:44.046 --> 04:46.420
on things.
I was taking inventory of your kitchen.

04:46.445 --> 04:49.155
Did you know you're using
the wrong coffee filters?

04:49.180 --> 04:51.113
Figures. Shade's job.

04:51.138 --> 04:54.592
Also,
I restocked your desk with new supplies.

04:54.952 --> 04:56.639
And I thought later,

04:56.664 --> 04:58.464
I would take a stab at
organizing your office.

04:58.489 --> 05:00.780
- That will not be necessary.
- You sure?

05:00.805 --> 05:02.896
There's a method to my madness. Listen,

05:02.921 --> 05:04.876
Shade and I are going to be out
a lot over the next few days,

05:04.900 --> 05:07.139
so just sit tight and
leave things as they are.

05:07.164 --> 05:10.295
Got it. No changing things. Except,

05:10.320 --> 05:13.358
Shade emailed me the new case details.

05:14.070 --> 05:15.710
Wow!

05:15.991 --> 05:18.983
Hey, are you uptodate
on new social media sites?

05:19.008 --> 05:22.389
Yeah. It's not Facebook,
Twitter, Insta, Snap, Tumblr,

05:22.414 --> 05:25.452
JDate or Ameechee.
They don't use a purple background.

05:25.477 --> 05:28.319
Morning, partner.
We gotta get to Ellard. Hey Zoe.

05:28.358 --> 05:30.958
Any lingering "todo list"
items I can scratch off

05:30.983 --> 05:32.937
- while you two are out?
- You know what?

05:32.962 --> 05:35.073
The door to Angie's
office sticks a little.

05:35.098 --> 05:36.304
You could try to tackle that.

05:36.329 --> 05:38.256
Don't worry about it,
it's been that way forever.

05:38.281 --> 05:40.905
Which makes the perfect thing
for our new employee to fix.

05:40.930 --> 05:43.263
Or to leave alone and
stick to filing today.

05:43.288 --> 05:46.733
Or not! Come on, we gotta jet.

05:49.396 --> 05:52.295
Copy that.

06:12.276 --> 06:14.277
No.

06:18.079 --> 06:21.447
It's just...

06:21.472 --> 06:24.173
weird knowing there's someone
in the office when we're not.

06:24.198 --> 06:26.719
Kind of comes along with the
territory when you hire someone.

06:26.744 --> 06:28.624
I'm just used to things a certain way.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.570
Come on, this is a good thing.
Now that we've got help,

06:30.594 --> 06:32.890
we can kick this business
into high gear. Did you get

06:32.915 --> 06:35.549
those design ideas I sent you?
We're not redesigning the office.

06:35.574 --> 06:37.674
Do you want to land
the big cases or not?

06:37.699 --> 06:39.108
How about we focus on this case?

06:39.133 --> 06:41.749
Fine. All we have to go
on is Mary's conversation

06:41.774 --> 06:44.491
with "Studentstud2000"
from last Thursday.

06:44.516 --> 06:45.929
We find him, we can put an end

06:45.954 --> 06:48.261
to this character assassination attempt.

06:48.286 --> 06:50.226
Unless it really happened.

06:50.804 --> 06:52.702
You think she actually did this?

06:52.727 --> 06:54.694
It wouldn't be the first
time that a teacher hooked up

06:54.718 --> 06:57.132
- with a student.
- Ellard is

06:57.157 --> 06:59.663
a prestigious institution.
Students are there

06:59.688 --> 07:03.272
hitting the books, not
hitting... you know.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.664
She's young, attractive, and human.

07:05.689 --> 07:07.590
Some of her students are eighteen and,
like it or not,

07:07.614 --> 07:10.108
teenagers have sex.

07:10.133 --> 07:12.304
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

07:22.219 --> 07:24.825
Hold on.

07:25.157 --> 07:27.661
Here you go.

07:28.661 --> 07:31.379
- What's this?
- Frame told me

07:31.404 --> 07:33.060
one of the gym teachers
is out sick this week,

07:33.084 --> 07:35.543
- so you're filling in.
- You want me to go undercover as a sub?

07:35.567 --> 07:37.878
- Yeah.
- Subs are the mall cops

07:37.903 --> 07:39.850
of the teaching world.
Nobody takes them seriously.

07:39.874 --> 07:41.770
Well, you go undercover all the time!

07:41.795 --> 07:43.895
And I can't do it, I'm too famous.

07:44.045 --> 07:46.219
Celebrity can be a curse, you know.

07:46.244 --> 07:49.309
I go undercover to blend in,
not teach a high school class.

07:49.334 --> 07:52.112
What am I supposed to say to
a group of hormonal teenagers?

07:52.137 --> 07:54.981
It's gym!
Make 'em play dodgeball or something.

07:55.006 --> 07:56.672
How does that help the case?

07:56.697 --> 07:58.715
It's gonna give you time
to suss out the mysterious

07:58.740 --> 08:01.675
purple website and look for
signs of social media villainy.

08:01.700 --> 08:04.638
And in the meantime, I'll talk
to Mary and send you some names.

08:04.710 --> 08:07.028
Next time, I come up with the plan.

08:12.864 --> 08:14.575
Wow.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.983
Wish my hockey coaches looked like that.

08:17.008 --> 08:19.473
I sense that wouldn't have
helped your career any.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.403
OK. Frame's on her way.

08:21.428 --> 08:24.176
All we gotta do now is keep
a low profile, try to fit in.

08:24.201 --> 08:27.364
- Mr. Shade?
- I'm sorry, you are?

08:27.389 --> 08:29.520
Brie, from the column
"Briefly with Brie". I write

08:29.545 --> 08:32.208
for "The Ellard Voice".
And you must be the new gym teacher.

08:32.234 --> 08:33.933
How do you know so much about us?

08:33.958 --> 08:36.095
Ear to the ground,
finger on the pulse...

08:36.120 --> 08:38.739
- How about a quote for my readers?
- Sure...

08:38.764 --> 08:41.681
"If you don't know where you're going,
you'll wind up

08:41.706 --> 08:43.392
someplace else."

08:44.246 --> 08:46.079
Great, thank you.

08:46.104 --> 08:48.903
So much for keeping a low profile,
Yogi Berra.

08:48.928 --> 08:51.225
Principal Frame,

08:51.250 --> 08:53.918
this is Angie, my partner,
and your new gym teacher.

08:53.943 --> 08:55.909
- Thank you for coming.
- Which way to the gym?

08:55.934 --> 08:58.501
- Athletics building.
- Your gym has its own building?

08:58.683 --> 09:00.569
Do you have your own restaurant, too?

09:00.594 --> 09:01.843
Yes.

09:02.386 --> 09:05.022
There's a map in there,
plus a list of your students.

09:05.047 --> 09:07.147
You're in classroom 212, down the hall.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.208
Classroom?

09:09.233 --> 09:11.400
I... I thought we were
playing dodgeball.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.931
The current unit is sexual education.

09:13.956 --> 09:15.907
Don't worry, Angie's a pro;

09:15.932 --> 09:18.114
It'll be the best hour
those kids ever had.

09:18.419 --> 09:20.747
Ahem! That came out wrong.

09:21.888 --> 09:24.083
- Sex Ed?!
- I know,

09:24.108 --> 09:26.174
I'm way more qualified to teach that.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.495
Stop it.
Seriously, what am I supposed to do?

09:28.520 --> 09:30.568
You're a sub! Show 'em a video.

09:41.795 --> 09:43.962
Good morning, class. I...

09:43.987 --> 09:46.900
am your substitute, Miss Everett.

09:46.925 --> 09:49.369
Today, for...

09:49.394 --> 09:52.801
sex ed, we're gonna watch a video.

09:53.669 --> 09:56.680
Does anyone know how to
set up the DVD player?

09:57.578 --> 09:59.579
OK!

09:59.604 --> 10:01.999
Miss Sinclair.

10:02.107 --> 10:04.219
Mr. Shade. What are you doing here?

10:04.244 --> 10:06.623
Principal Frame asked
me to stop by and talk

10:06.648 --> 10:08.682
to some of the students
that are falling behind.

10:08.707 --> 10:10.874
That's kind of you.
People give up too easily

10:10.899 --> 10:13.760
on kids these days. I know what
it feels like to lose your way.

10:13.785 --> 10:15.911
- We're all just human.
- According to Jules,

10:15.936 --> 10:18.123
you're superhuman.
She's a really big fan.

10:18.148 --> 10:20.639
- Is she doing OK in your class?
- Absolutely.

10:20.664 --> 10:22.895
Jules is a great student.
She's inquisitive,

10:22.920 --> 10:25.185
- perceptive and engaged.
- I only asked because

10:25.210 --> 10:27.887
she stopped by your office last
Thursday for some extra help.

10:27.958 --> 10:29.717
Last Thursday...

10:30.148 --> 10:32.982
I had a doctor's appointment.

10:33.287 --> 10:36.296
Gotcha.
Well, good to know she's not failing.

10:36.321 --> 10:38.668
Far from it.
Please tell her I'm sorry I missed her.

10:38.693 --> 10:40.583
I will, thanks.

10:41.570 --> 10:43.894
Anyone I should look out for?

10:44.068 --> 10:46.506
- I'm sorry?
- My talk, this afternoon.

10:46.531 --> 10:48.194
Standing up there in
front of all the kids,

10:48.218 --> 10:50.178
I'm sure I'm gonna get eaten alive.

10:50.873 --> 10:53.200
Marty Austin. Class clown.

10:53.225 --> 10:55.740
He likes to make his friends
laugh by embarrassing adults.

10:55.765 --> 10:58.803
- Look for the Bieber hair.
- Gotcha. Thanks.

11:00.677 --> 11:03.162
What happens if you wait until
you're married and then you have

11:03.187 --> 11:05.637
sex for the first time and
discover you don't like it?

11:05.662 --> 11:08.982
You know, there's gotta be great
communication and understanding.

11:11.935 --> 11:13.701
- Hey!
- Hey, how's it going?

11:13.726 --> 11:16.448
Well, the room smells like
bubble gum and Axe body spray.

11:16.473 --> 11:19.787
- Where are you on the suspect?
- Marty Austin.

11:19.812 --> 11:23.247
See if he's in your class.
Mary says he's always on her case.

11:25.730 --> 11:28.140
Got him.

11:28.165 --> 11:30.943
- Might not be that great.
- I find it's hard

11:30.968 --> 11:32.706
to talk about sex. It is very...

11:32.731 --> 11:35.644
Marty, no texting in class.
Can I have that, please?

11:35.683 --> 11:37.112
Only if you put your number in there.

11:37.136 --> 11:39.939
Ha ha ha.
Grow two feet and add fifteen years

11:39.964 --> 11:42.589
and I'll turn you down properly.

11:45.325 --> 11:48.120
We are really united with someone,

11:48.145 --> 11:51.659
- does that have to happen?
- The advice I'd give could be,

11:51.684 --> 11:55.373
not to only focus your
relationship on that because

11:55.398 --> 11:57.462
that's not what it's all about.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.076
Miss Everett?

12:02.101 --> 12:04.501
- Yeah?
- The movie's done. It was quick.

12:04.964 --> 12:07.269
It happens.

12:10.934 --> 12:13.900
O... K, well...

12:14.939 --> 12:16.873
Does... anyone

12:16.898 --> 12:19.072
have any... questions about sex?

12:21.354 --> 12:23.018
Dear...

12:27.067 --> 12:30.266
How can teenagers still
have so many questions

12:30.291 --> 12:32.377
about sex?!
Haven't they heard of the internet?

12:32.402 --> 12:34.620
- Have you been on the internet?
- I've looked through Marty's

12:34.644 --> 12:36.424
phone and I found an
app called PeriWink.

12:36.449 --> 12:38.581
- Never heard of it.
- Basically a private version

12:38.606 --> 12:40.924
of Facebook. You can create an
alias and send secure messages

12:40.948 --> 12:43.884
to other users. And it's purple. Look.

12:43.909 --> 12:46.884
Did you find "Studentstud2000"?

12:46.909 --> 12:49.494
That's the problem, it's members only.
I can't join

12:49.519 --> 12:51.596
unless I'm invited by an existing user.

12:53.534 --> 12:56.054
You want my PeriWink login? Why?

12:56.079 --> 12:58.127
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important,
honey.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.604
Important like sending Angie undercover

12:59.628 --> 13:02.565
- as the hot sex ed teacher?
- You know about that?

13:02.590 --> 13:05.135
Yeah, you're trending.
Hashtag "hoteverett".

13:05.908 --> 13:07.571
Dad, what's going on?

13:07.596 --> 13:09.346
I know you're not here
as a guest speaker.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.264
We're working a case I
couldn't tell you about.

13:11.289 --> 13:12.171
We have to keep it quiet.

13:12.196 --> 13:14.330
So you lied and now you want a favour?

13:14.355 --> 13:16.299
All we can say is that
someone you care about

13:16.324 --> 13:19.674
- at the school is in trouble.
- OK.

13:22.804 --> 13:24.804
Just sent you an invite.

13:24.829 --> 13:27.891
- Thanks, honey.
- Yeah.

13:28.686 --> 13:31.520
OK... StudentStud's
profile is mostly blank;

13:31.545 --> 13:33.623
No photo, no personal information.

13:33.647 --> 13:36.181
If you're a teenager on social media,
isn't the point

13:36.206 --> 13:38.006
- to be seen and known?
- Yeah, absolutely.

13:38.031 --> 13:40.429
- It's like a selfie freeforall.
- Look,

13:40.454 --> 13:42.709
he only has one friend. Mary Sinclair.

13:42.734 --> 13:45.334
Wait a minute, that's not right.

13:45.878 --> 13:48.997
- Mary was set up.
- The message you were sent

13:49.022 --> 13:51.881
is a fake. It's from
an app called PeriWink.

13:51.906 --> 13:54.317
Mary's account,
and the account for Studentstud2000

13:54.342 --> 13:56.233
were both created within
minutes of each other

13:56.258 --> 13:58.584
on the same day they
allegedly slept together.

13:58.609 --> 14:00.768
And, Mary's personal
information is all wrong.

14:00.793 --> 14:03.899
It says she's been teaching here
for five years instead of three.

14:03.924 --> 14:05.998
You think one person
created both accounts

14:06.023 --> 14:07.726
and manufactured the
conversation between them.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.944
Exactly. You're not smiling.

14:09.968 --> 14:10.984
- Why aren't you smiling?
- Because

14:11.008 --> 14:12.884
as much as I'd like to believe you,

14:12.910 --> 14:14.776
the situation has escalated.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.691
- Who's that?
- Josh Remar,

14:19.716 --> 14:22.396
captain of the basketball team.
And he just told me

14:22.421 --> 14:26.902
he was seduced by Mary.

14:29.387 --> 14:31.473
Is this your idea of a
prestigious institution?

14:31.498 --> 14:34.154
He's a teenager.
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

14:34.179 --> 14:35.871
Let's go, son.

14:41.910 --> 14:44.153
That went about as well as I expected.

14:44.178 --> 14:47.668
I don't understand.
How can Josh be "Studentstud2000"

14:47.693 --> 14:49.726
when the accounts are
clearly fabricated?

14:49.751 --> 14:51.451
That's for the police to sort out.

14:51.476 --> 14:54.577
- You're involving the police?
- Josh is sixteen.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.145
Age of consent with a person
of authority is eighteen.

14:57.170 --> 14:59.004
Are you saying Mary could be charged?

14:59.082 --> 15:01.715
I never wanted it to come to this.
But now that I have

15:01.740 --> 15:03.817
an allegation from a living,
breathing student, I have

15:03.841 --> 15:05.841
no choice but to follow protocol.

15:05.866 --> 15:08.464
That means informing the police
and the board of directors.

15:08.489 --> 15:10.990
What, so just when we uncover

15:11.015 --> 15:13.682
that the online messages are fake,
this kid comes forward

15:13.707 --> 15:15.214
with an accusation? You got to admit,

15:15.239 --> 15:17.801
- the timing's a little suspect.
- I agree.

15:17.826 --> 15:19.968
But the only thing that will
exonerate Mary at this point

15:19.992 --> 15:22.860
- is evidence.
- We'll find it.

15:22.885 --> 15:26.003
Well you better do it quickly.
Once the board hears of this,

15:26.028 --> 15:28.195
they'll call an emergency meeting,
at which point

15:28.220 --> 15:30.621
I'll be asked to explain why
I didn't report this incident

15:30.646 --> 15:32.481
immediately. After that,

15:32.506 --> 15:35.406
I suspect I won't be principal anymore.

15:41.650 --> 15:44.252
No, no, no, stop right there.
I can't tell you anything.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.911
You don't even know
what we're gonna ask ya!

15:45.935 --> 15:48.156
The Ellard kid, right?
Getting the horizontal history

15:48.181 --> 15:50.308
- lesson from his teacher?
- Just wanna know what he said!

15:50.332 --> 15:51.629
Can't help you. It's not my case.

15:51.653 --> 15:54.458
His statement was recorded, right?
We just wanna see the footage.

15:54.483 --> 15:57.419
Angie, he's a minor, for
cryin' out loud. Excuse me.

15:57.444 --> 16:00.827
He's also a liar. That
teacher he accused,

16:00.852 --> 16:03.411
she might lose her job.
Not to mention her reputation

16:03.436 --> 16:05.459
- is gonna be destroyed.
- OK, you know what?

16:05.483 --> 16:07.997
I found his story seemed a little fishy,
but...

16:08.022 --> 16:09.544
what can I do? My hands are tied.

16:09.569 --> 16:13.005
- Zoe's gonna be so disappointed.
- Yeah.

16:13.224 --> 16:15.536
- Zoe?
- Yeah! The crazy girl

16:15.561 --> 16:17.708
from the Beach.
We hired her as an office assistant.

16:17.733 --> 16:19.857
- You hired her?
- She remembered how helpful

16:19.882 --> 16:21.716
you were and suggested
we come down here.

16:21.741 --> 16:23.842
- She is going to feel so bad...
- Yeah...

16:23.867 --> 16:26.294
when I tell her that it didn't work out.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.042
OK, you wanna see the video?
I'm gonna need some intel.

16:31.067 --> 16:33.981
Pet names, phobias,
astrology, yay or nay.

16:34.006 --> 16:35.443
I'll give you favourite Starbucks drink,

16:35.467 --> 16:37.867
favourite movie, and any allergies.
Take it or leave it.

16:47.356 --> 16:49.357
Door.

16:53.453 --> 16:56.406
OK now, if anybody catches you in here,
you broke in.

16:56.431 --> 16:59.008
- We get arrested for that?
- Absolutely.

17:01.108 --> 17:03.543
Hey, Gail! How you doin'?

17:06.922 --> 17:10.599
Just relax. Tell me what you
remember about the incident.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.202
We met at this motel on Cawthra.

17:15.656 --> 17:18.123
I made the room romantic.

17:18.500 --> 17:22.015
Tea lights, rose petals.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.175
Orangescented chocolate.
Miss Sinclair met me at five PM.

17:26.201 --> 17:28.375
She wore a silver...

17:28.492 --> 17:30.672
"negligee".

17:30.718 --> 17:32.890
Come on. This kid

17:32.915 --> 17:35.082
doesn't even know what a "negliG" is.

17:35.107 --> 17:37.939
- This is clearly rehearsed.
- Wait, five PM...

17:37.964 --> 17:41.031
Mary told me she was at the
doctor that day after school.

17:41.056 --> 17:43.836
We confirm that alibi
and she's off the hook.

17:44.828 --> 17:47.288
What? Do you have any idea

17:47.313 --> 17:49.508
how damaging an allegation like this is?

17:49.533 --> 17:52.156
It sticks to your record
whether it's true or not.

17:52.181 --> 17:54.682
- Don't give up yet.
- But I tried for years

17:54.707 --> 17:58.750
to get hired at that school.
I loved working there so much,

17:58.775 --> 18:02.069
and now it's just all gone.
Wait, why would Josh

18:02.094 --> 18:05.262
say those things about me?
We need to hear your side of the story.

18:05.287 --> 18:07.476
Your appointment, last Thursday.
Give us the doctor's

18:07.501 --> 18:09.922
name and we'll take that back to Frame.

18:11.578 --> 18:13.929
I didn't go to the doctor's.

18:15.062 --> 18:17.062
So, where were you?

18:17.087 --> 18:19.836
At a protest. Against Pelican Foods.

18:19.861 --> 18:22.524
- The packaged food company?
- Why didn't you say so?

18:22.549 --> 18:24.743
They built Ellard's gymnasium.

18:24.768 --> 18:28.470
They fund the annual European
trip for the graduating class.

18:28.495 --> 18:30.266
If anyone knew that I was protesting

18:30.291 --> 18:33.025
against their genetically modified
foods, I'd be in big trouble.

18:33.050 --> 18:35.016
Bigger trouble than you're in now?

18:35.041 --> 18:36.874
The irony is not lost on me.

18:36.899 --> 18:38.891
Can anyone confirm you
were at the protest?

18:38.916 --> 18:41.249
Someone we can speak to?

18:43.376 --> 18:47.179
Mary, if we can prove you were
somewhere other than a motel

18:47.204 --> 18:49.586
with Josh, this can end.

18:51.149 --> 18:54.376
Cooper Houser. He saw me there.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.727
- Is he another protester?
- No.

18:56.775 --> 19:00.719
He's the Chief Communications
Officer for Pelican Foods.

19:08.202 --> 19:10.607
Cooper Houser?

19:10.905 --> 19:13.866
I... respect whatever religion you are,
but no thank you.

19:13.891 --> 19:16.458
We're private investigators.
Do you have a minute?

19:16.546 --> 19:19.826
- Cooper, what's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right in, Renee.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.505
Do you know this woman?
She says she was at a protest

19:27.530 --> 19:29.295
against your company last Thursday.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.788
Yes, I recognize her.
Her name's Mary Sinclair.

19:31.801 --> 19:33.801
You know the names of
all your protesters?

19:33.826 --> 19:35.975
Miss Sinclair has been very
vocal against my company

19:36.000 --> 19:38.044
for the past year and a half.
She communicates with me

19:38.068 --> 19:40.351
- when she's organizing protests.
- That sounds civil!

19:40.376 --> 19:42.420
Everyone has a right to free speech.

19:42.445 --> 19:44.422
Remember what time the protest ended?

19:44.447 --> 19:47.525
- About 6:30.
- Did you see this kid there?

19:47.550 --> 19:49.960
Nope. Never seen him before.

19:49.985 --> 19:51.389
Thanks.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.577
The protest ended at 6:30,
Josh said he met Mary at 5;

19:55.602 --> 19:58.035
Slam dunk.
The kid's story doesn't hold water.

19:58.060 --> 20:00.732
They could have met up after
the protest. Josh did say

20:00.757 --> 20:02.913
- they were up all night.
- Come on.

20:02.938 --> 20:05.339
That kid doesn't have
that kind of stamina.

20:05.364 --> 20:07.883
We need more proof than a
wonky timeline to get Frame

20:07.908 --> 20:11.449
- and Mary off the hook.
- What about Josh's statement

20:11.474 --> 20:13.717
to the police?
You said yourself it sounded rehearsed.

20:13.742 --> 20:15.117
Maybe somebody's pulling his strings.

20:15.141 --> 20:17.575
Making a false statement is no joke.
I mean, Whoever it is

20:17.600 --> 20:19.117
would need to have something big on him.

20:19.141 --> 20:21.174
Maybe they do.

20:41.146 --> 20:43.514
Hey, Jules! I got ice cream from Ed's!

20:43.539 --> 20:45.298
Jeez! I left my phone in the car.
Can you go?

20:45.322 --> 20:48.345
- Sure.
- Never mind,

20:48.370 --> 20:50.802
- it's... it's right here.
- OK. Well,

20:50.827 --> 20:53.064
check your pocket before
you hit the panic button

20:53.089 --> 20:55.056
- next time.
- Sorry.

20:55.736 --> 20:57.277
Hey, Liam.

20:57.302 --> 20:59.235
Evening, Mr. Shade. Is that a...

20:59.269 --> 21:01.169
is that a new coat?
Looks... it looks sharp.

21:01.194 --> 21:03.721
- You always have sharp coats...
- Stop saying coats, Liam

21:03.746 --> 21:06.599
- and help me scoop ice cream.
- OK!

21:11.663 --> 21:13.697
Yep.

21:14.394 --> 21:17.948
- Hi. Ahem!
- Hey. Where's your grandpa?

21:17.973 --> 21:20.027
He went to bed. I
thought you and Angie

21:20.052 --> 21:22.183
- were still working the case.
- That's actually

21:22.208 --> 21:24.603
why we're here. We need to talk to you.

21:24.628 --> 21:27.636
About Miss Sinclair.
Yeah, the story is all over school.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.254
There's even an article
in The Ellard Voice.

21:29.278 --> 21:32.355
Sorry about that.
We tried to stop that from happening.

21:32.380 --> 21:35.027
Now I get why you couldn't tell me.

21:35.052 --> 21:38.417
Maybe you can help us, honey.
What can you tell me about Josh?

21:38.442 --> 21:40.589
Well, I mean,
no one believes it actually happened.

21:40.614 --> 21:43.386
- Then why is he saying it did?
- Thank you.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.426
Could someone be threatening
Josh with something?

21:47.451 --> 21:49.550
Losing his athletic scholarship maybe?

21:49.575 --> 21:51.925
He literally lives and
breathes basketball.

21:51.950 --> 21:54.217
When you're on scholarship,
you have to keep grades up,

21:54.242 --> 21:56.730
right? How are Josh's?

21:56.755 --> 21:59.948
Calculus is his kryptonite.
He was super worked up

21:59.973 --> 22:02.012
over the midterm a few weeks ago.
But then he scored, like,

22:02.036 --> 22:04.136
a high eighty.

22:05.394 --> 22:08.386
- What?
- When I was Josh's age,

22:08.411 --> 22:11.779
I knew a guy named... Mark.

22:11.804 --> 22:13.870
And Mark wasn't very good at math.

22:13.895 --> 22:16.480
- Mark's whole life was...
- Hockey?

22:16.505 --> 22:19.324
No... Football!

22:19.349 --> 22:22.253
Or something... Anyway,

22:22.278 --> 22:24.180
they wouldn't let you play
if you had crappy grades,

22:24.204 --> 22:26.191
so Mark...

22:26.216 --> 22:29.067
Bought an old test from a former student

22:29.092 --> 22:31.824
- to pass his class.
- Mark is such a cheater!

22:31.849 --> 22:34.198
Hey, Mark was young. Don't judge him.

22:34.223 --> 22:36.791
If Josh did the same thing and
someone found out about it...

22:36.816 --> 22:38.542
They could use that
information as leverage

22:38.567 --> 22:40.777
- to get him to lie about Mary.
- We just need to prove

22:40.802 --> 22:43.102
that Josh bought a test online.

22:46.229 --> 22:48.321
Hey Zoe. Can you go
online and figure out

22:48.347 --> 22:50.111
where someone could
buy an Ellard midterm?

22:50.136 --> 22:53.181
- Yep, I can try.
- Great. How's the filing going?

22:53.206 --> 22:56.240
I filed the crap out of those files.

23:00.922 --> 23:04.269
Yep...

23:11.727 --> 23:15.730
- You're off your game tonight.
- Who are you?

23:15.832 --> 23:18.414
- Hey, Miss Everett.
- Come on.

23:18.448 --> 23:22.143
- He wasn't even in your class!
- What can I say, I'm trending.

23:22.456 --> 23:24.316
I bet you're being
scouted by some pretty

23:24.341 --> 23:27.423
- serious universities?
- Sure am. Why?

23:27.448 --> 23:30.323
Shame to throw it all away
over one stupid mistake.

23:30.431 --> 23:31.721
What's that?

23:31.746 --> 23:35.525
A copy of your calculus midterm.
Well, not yours exactly,

23:35.550 --> 23:38.292
the one you bought online
from a former Ellard student

23:38.317 --> 23:41.948
to cheat off. Exact same answers.
Both right and wrong.

23:41.973 --> 23:44.566
Time to tell the truth
about Miss Sinclair, Josh.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.160
No! They said if I did
this, they wouldn't say

23:46.184 --> 23:48.413
- anything about the test!
- They?

23:48.438 --> 23:51.120
Did someone threaten you?

23:51.666 --> 23:54.152
They hacked my PeriWink account.

23:54.177 --> 23:56.230
They found out I cheated..

23:56.369 --> 23:59.270
And blackmailed you into
claiming you slept with Mary.

23:59.295 --> 24:01.962
I'll deny anything you say about me.

24:02.012 --> 24:03.946
They'll get me expelled if I don't.

24:03.971 --> 24:05.886
Who? You need to tell us.

24:05.911 --> 24:08.066
The ones who control
everything at this school!

24:08.091 --> 24:10.422
The Ellard Eight!

24:18.161 --> 24:21.136
The Ellard Eight? Is this a joke?

24:21.161 --> 24:23.962
- Who are the Ellard Eight?
- An urban legend.

24:23.987 --> 24:26.583
Back when Ellard was first founded,
the eight students

24:26.608 --> 24:28.700
with the highest social
standing supposedly...

24:28.725 --> 24:30.426
formed an elite club.

24:30.451 --> 24:32.818
The idea was to bond them for
life as they went on to become

24:32.843 --> 24:36.036
captains of industry.
But the group doesn't actually exist.

24:36.061 --> 24:38.576
Josh thinks it does.
He said he was contacted

24:38.601 --> 24:40.848
by their leader,
who threatened to expose his cheating

24:40.873 --> 24:43.084
- unless he accused Mary.
- Well,

24:43.109 --> 24:45.008
he's plenty exposed now.

24:45.033 --> 24:46.936
Is he prepared to recant his statement?

24:46.961 --> 24:49.154
He's scared to.

24:49.179 --> 24:51.467
Then there's nothing I can do.

24:51.492 --> 24:54.581
The board meets tomorrow.
I've run out of time.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.685
Ms. Frame...

24:57.710 --> 25:01.318
- You can't give up.
- It's alright, Mr. Shade.

25:01.343 --> 25:05.076
I've had a good run as principal.
I'll land on my feet.

25:05.101 --> 25:07.358
Good day.

25:08.655 --> 25:11.092
We can't let her and Mary
take the fall for this.

25:11.117 --> 25:13.404
How do you find a group
that doesn't exist?

25:13.429 --> 25:15.763
Maybe they do and Frame doesn't know it.

25:15.884 --> 25:18.151
OK, well, they're a student club...

25:18.176 --> 25:20.358
How about we ask the students?

25:21.568 --> 25:23.877
Hey, Zoe,

25:23.902 --> 25:26.334
I think you accidentally
locked the door to my office

25:26.359 --> 25:30.028
- last night. I couldn't get in.
- Sorry. I will look into it.

25:47.273 --> 25:50.105
The Ellard Eight? No way!
I've always wanted to be a member.

25:50.130 --> 25:52.747
- So, they're real?
- Of course they're real,

25:52.772 --> 25:54.842
they just don't want anyone
to know they're real.

25:54.867 --> 25:57.745
- Who runs the group?
- I don't know.

25:57.770 --> 25:59.535
But their leader is called "Number One".

25:59.560 --> 26:00.818
Just like the Skull and Bones.

26:00.843 --> 26:03.200
No, not like the Skull and Bones, Dad.

26:03.225 --> 26:05.859
- It's a glorified fraternity.
- You know what else

26:05.884 --> 26:07.287
- is a fraternity?
- What?

26:07.312 --> 26:08.888
- Don't...
- The Illuminati.

26:08.913 --> 26:12.013
I'll send you some literature.
It'll blow your mind!

26:13.248 --> 26:15.753
Why would The Ellard Eight
target Miss Sinclair?

26:15.778 --> 26:17.998
- What kind of a threat is she?
- Maybe we can find out

26:18.023 --> 26:20.357
if we know where they meet.
Any idea where that is?

26:20.382 --> 26:22.154
No. But I do know someone

26:22.179 --> 26:24.349
who was in consideration to join them...

26:30.224 --> 26:32.012
Mr. Shade!

26:32.037 --> 26:33.568
Thanks for inviting me onto the team.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.826
You're not on the...

26:36.172 --> 26:38.206
Thrilled to have you here, buddy.

26:38.231 --> 26:39.866
- Did you bring the letter?
- Yes.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.810
The Ellard Eight left this in
my locker last term. I followed

26:42.835 --> 26:45.269
all of the instructions on it, but I...
I couldn't find it,

26:45.294 --> 26:48.286
- so I wasn't let into the group.
- "Into the deepest darkness."

26:48.311 --> 26:50.224
Tunnel through to find the light."

26:50.249 --> 26:52.116
There are some service
tunnels under the school

26:52.141 --> 26:54.568
but I got lost in
them. They're this way.

27:11.929 --> 27:14.965
It's pitch black in there.
I couldn't find my way through.

27:17.208 --> 27:19.516
Look.

27:22.515 --> 27:26.024
Let's divide and conquer.
Jules, you come with me.

27:26.049 --> 27:28.602
Actually, can I go with Angie?

27:28.627 --> 27:32.001
Sure.

27:33.543 --> 27:35.915
That means it's you
and me then, Mr. Shade!

27:36.954 --> 27:39.899
Fantastic.

27:49.407 --> 27:52.704
So, how's school? You like it here?

27:52.729 --> 27:54.720
Yeah. Yeah. It was easier

27:54.745 --> 27:57.290
when I was staying at my Dad's.
It's a long commute

27:57.315 --> 27:59.915
from Mom's place,
and she's always running late.

27:59.940 --> 28:01.829
I'm... pretty sure your Dad

28:01.854 --> 28:04.384
would be willing to
pick you up sometimes.

28:04.429 --> 28:07.040
Yeah, but then Mom would get mad, and...
you know.

28:10.427 --> 28:13.328
You alright, sir?
You know, we can rest if you want.

28:13.463 --> 28:16.001
I'm a former professional athlete, Liam.

28:16.026 --> 28:18.026
Let's keep moving.

28:18.360 --> 28:21.571
So, I guess you have to do a lot of...
research

28:21.596 --> 28:24.539
- when you go undercover?
- Yeah, I celebrate

28:24.564 --> 28:27.150
the day Wikipedia was born.

28:27.403 --> 28:29.735
I've never really liked the dark,
I'll be honest.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.415
But it's not like I think
there's monsters or anything...

28:32.440 --> 28:33.954
There aren't any monsters, Liam.

28:33.979 --> 28:37.212
- I know.
- Like when you went undercover

28:37.237 --> 28:39.337
as a sex ed teacher...

28:39.362 --> 28:43.030
did you... practice? Teaching?

28:43.055 --> 28:45.829
- Sex.
- Um...

28:45.854 --> 28:47.820
I mean, do you...

28:47.845 --> 28:50.513
know about sex...

28:50.538 --> 28:53.391
Do you know about teaching sex?

28:53.416 --> 28:56.001
Where is this going, Jules?

28:56.026 --> 28:58.221
How do you know if it's the right time?

28:58.246 --> 29:00.246
- Boy.
- If anything,

29:00.271 --> 29:02.829
this place would have serial
killers or crazy hobos.

29:03.262 --> 29:05.946
If a crazy hobo serial
killer comes after us,

29:05.971 --> 29:08.110
I'll let him kill me first, OK?

29:08.135 --> 29:10.649
- That's nice of you.
- Last time I said the "s" word

29:10.674 --> 29:12.941
in front of Dad,
he pretended to hear rats in the attic

29:12.966 --> 29:16.200
and spent two hours fakesearching
for them to avoid the conversation.

29:16.403 --> 29:18.634
I bet Jules isn't afraid.
You know she isn't afraid

29:18.659 --> 29:20.959
of anything. She says
that comes from you.

29:21.044 --> 29:23.235
- Really?
- Yeah. Whenever she's scared,

29:23.260 --> 29:26.329
she just thinks about what you would do,
and it calms her down.

29:26.354 --> 29:29.255
It's not easy being a
teenager. I remember.

29:29.639 --> 29:32.282
You want everything right
away and it's all...

29:32.307 --> 29:34.242
it's all right there,
in front of you, so there's no reason

29:34.266 --> 29:36.900
why you shouldn't have it, but...

29:37.344 --> 29:39.610
You don't have to rush.

29:39.871 --> 29:41.860
Trust me.

29:41.885 --> 29:44.985
Life'll still be there waiting
when the time is right.

29:45.101 --> 29:48.571
Now I see why everyone was
so stoked for your class.

29:48.622 --> 29:51.595
Me, I babble. Like now.

29:51.778 --> 29:53.626
Would you like to hold
the flashlight, Liam?

29:53.651 --> 29:56.751
- Yes, please.
- Is that your hand on my neck?

29:56.776 --> 29:59.411
- No.
- Something's on me!

29:59.436 --> 30:01.813
I broke the flashlight.

30:01.838 --> 30:04.423
So it happened.

30:04.448 --> 30:07.868
My phone's in the car.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.829
OK, you do realize I'm blind, right?

30:09.854 --> 30:13.422
I'm used to not being able to see.
I'll lead the way.

30:15.631 --> 30:18.630
Wait, there's air
coming out of this wall.

30:18.655 --> 30:20.376
I think there's a door here.

30:21.257 --> 30:23.829
Shade! I think we found it!

30:23.854 --> 30:26.071
Follow my voice!

30:26.096 --> 30:28.462
Alright, I hear you. We're comin'!

30:39.219 --> 30:41.454
So the Ellard Eight do exist.

30:41.479 --> 30:44.347
Yet they seem about as
threatening as One Direction.

30:44.372 --> 30:46.290
Check it out.

30:46.452 --> 30:49.743
These are all pictures
of... Number Ones.

30:49.768 --> 30:52.727
Nothing for this year.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.087
Shade. Isn't that...?

31:03.112 --> 31:05.103
Cooper Houser.

31:05.128 --> 31:08.173
CCO of Pelican Foods.

31:09.917 --> 31:13.353
Mary was protesting against
a former Number One.

31:27.794 --> 31:30.429
Hey, how are you doin'? Is Angie around?

31:30.454 --> 31:33.294
- You're that cop.
- I am cop, yeah, sure.

31:33.319 --> 31:35.519
- She's not here.
- It's too bad!

31:35.544 --> 31:37.944
Yeah, that barista made an
extra one of these by mistake.

31:37.969 --> 31:39.739
Say, you wouldn't want it, would you?

31:39.764 --> 31:41.960
It's a doublesweet,
Venti, caramel macchiato,

31:41.985 --> 31:44.219
- with extra foam.
- Are you kidding me?

31:44.244 --> 31:48.070
- I can't stand that sweet stuff.
- Are you sure?

31:49.637 --> 31:51.772
You're not actually a fan of the films

31:51.797 --> 31:54.130
of JeanClaude Van
Damme either, are you?

31:54.930 --> 31:58.532
Yeah, OK. Well... I'm gonna kill her.

32:00.079 --> 32:02.080
Can you keep a secret?

32:02.105 --> 32:04.187
I think so, yeah. I mean,

32:04.212 --> 32:06.070
do you have a secret
that you wanna tell me?

32:06.095 --> 32:08.894
I'd love to hear it.
OK, what is happening right now?

32:08.919 --> 32:11.211
Where are you taking me?

32:15.852 --> 32:17.796
What the hell happened in there?

32:20.797 --> 32:24.069
Angie's door sticks.
She told me not to fix it,

32:24.094 --> 32:26.304
but you can't tell me stuff like that.

32:26.329 --> 32:28.258
Opening the door made
a hole in the wall.

32:28.283 --> 32:30.296
When I spackled over it,
I had to paint, so I moved the light

32:30.320 --> 32:32.796
sconce, which revealed faulty wiring,
which revealed

32:32.821 --> 32:35.212
two light switches that don't
actually turn anything on.

32:35.236 --> 32:37.625
Hey! It's OK. We can figure this out.

32:37.650 --> 32:40.117
- You know about repairs?
- No. I didn't...

32:40.142 --> 32:42.576
- I didn't mean that.
- What am I going to do?

32:42.600 --> 32:44.773
I need to figure something
out before they come back.

32:44.798 --> 32:47.024
You know what?
My cousin's a contractor. I'm on it.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.586
- My God.
- Yeah.

32:48.611 --> 32:51.612
Tell him, I will do anything.
I will owe him one forever.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.211
You'll owe him one forever? I'm sure,

32:54.236 --> 32:56.670
he'll be thrilled to hear that.

32:56.877 --> 32:58.743
You really think this is gonna work?

32:58.768 --> 33:00.516
Frame's meeting with the
Ellard board in a few hours.

33:00.540 --> 33:02.740
So, if Cooper's using the
influence of The Ellard Eight

33:02.765 --> 33:04.149
to attack Mary, we
need to rattle his cage

33:04.173 --> 33:06.015
before it's too late.

33:06.472 --> 33:08.430
Here he comes.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.149
My goodness!

33:12.174 --> 33:14.367
- I'm so sorry!
- I've warned him

33:14.392 --> 33:16.594
- about walking and texting.
- She has. She says I'm gonna

33:16.618 --> 33:18.891
walk right into traffic.
You're the investigators.

33:18.916 --> 33:21.522
- Matt Shade. Small world.
- How is the case going?

33:21.547 --> 33:22.883
With, Miss Sinclair?

33:22.908 --> 33:24.367
We've had a breakthrough, actually.

33:24.393 --> 33:26.376
We believe someone's trying
to frame her. Have you ever

33:26.400 --> 33:28.280
- heard of The Ellard Eight?
- Can't say I have.

33:28.308 --> 33:30.826
Really? 'Cause you're an Ellard alumnus,
and your wife

33:30.859 --> 33:34.164
- sits on the board.
- We googled you. You know,

33:34.189 --> 33:37.023
I was wondering.
What's a communications officer even

33:37.048 --> 33:39.616
- doing at a protest rally?
- We want the public to feel

33:39.641 --> 33:42.368
free to communicate with Pelican,
even if we don't

33:42.393 --> 33:44.235
- agree with the message.
- Very noble.

33:44.260 --> 33:47.395
Not unlike The Ellard Eight.
A secret student society

33:47.408 --> 33:49.775
at Ellard's, going back generations.
Rumour is

33:49.800 --> 33:52.901
their clubhouse is hidden in the
service tunnels under the school.

33:52.926 --> 33:55.992
We find it, we'll find the
person responsible for this.

33:56.017 --> 33:57.650
Sounds like a wild goose chase.

33:57.675 --> 33:59.822
If that goose fabricated a sex scandal

33:59.847 --> 34:01.493
to slander a teacher's
character, then yes,

34:01.517 --> 34:04.500
that's exactly what this is.
And when we find out who's behind it

34:04.525 --> 34:06.759
their goose is cooked.

34:06.788 --> 34:09.880
Well, I... wish you two the best.

34:12.821 --> 34:14.313
"Their goose is cooked"?

34:14.338 --> 34:16.164
Yeah, I'm sorry, it just popped out.

34:16.188 --> 34:19.108
Besides, looks like it worked.

34:19.132 --> 34:21.516
He's lit up about something.

34:40.648 --> 34:42.835
Let me ask you something,
what's goin' on

34:42.860 --> 34:45.532
- with you and Jules?
- What do you mean?

34:45.556 --> 34:47.556
Don't get me wrong, I'm glad it's you

34:47.581 --> 34:49.382
and not of one of
Becca's friends, but...

34:49.408 --> 34:51.367
What? I just get the feeling

34:51.391 --> 34:54.203
she talks to you about
things she won't say to me.

34:54.654 --> 34:56.524
What kind of things

34:56.549 --> 34:58.539
are you worried she's
talking to me about?

34:58.564 --> 35:01.398
I don't know. Things.

35:01.423 --> 35:05.141
- Personal things.
- She's growing up, Shade.

35:05.166 --> 35:08.219
There's gonna be things that she
doesn't wanna talk about with her Dad.

35:08.244 --> 35:10.836
- Like what?
- He's pulling over.

35:20.777 --> 35:24.001
Look! It's Mary? What's she doing here?

35:24.572 --> 35:27.573
Maybe she figured out
he's behind all this.

35:27.598 --> 35:29.899
That doesn't look good.

35:29.924 --> 35:31.774
No.

35:44.387 --> 35:46.589
Cooper's wife's gonna have
questions if she comes home

35:46.614 --> 35:48.255
- and Mary's inside.
- She's probably already

35:48.279 --> 35:50.247
at Ellard. The board
meeting's in less than an hour,

35:50.271 --> 35:52.838
- we're cutting it close.
- Should we call the cops?

35:54.913 --> 35:57.413
I wouldn't do that just yet.

36:00.469 --> 36:04.191
- Didn't see that coming.
- No.

36:08.750 --> 36:11.316
How long have you been
seeing each other?

36:11.341 --> 36:14.199
We met during a protest
about a year and a half ago.

36:14.224 --> 36:16.566
When Cooper found out I
was a teacher at Ellard,

36:16.591 --> 36:18.824
he wanted to know why
I was against Pelican.

36:19.269 --> 36:21.925
After a few glasses of wine,

36:21.950 --> 36:24.503
we found a connection much deeper.

36:24.719 --> 36:27.394
- Does your wife know?
- Yes. She's... she's known

36:27.419 --> 36:29.628
- for some time.
- Any chance she could be

36:29.653 --> 36:31.319
- behind this?
- Renee isn't vindictive

36:31.344 --> 36:33.830
like that.
We're getting a divorce, she just...

36:33.855 --> 36:35.832
doesn't want to hurt
the family with the news

36:35.857 --> 36:37.792
- until it's finalized.
- You two were together

36:37.817 --> 36:39.248
after the protest.
That's the real reason

36:39.272 --> 36:41.119
you can't admit where
you were last Thursday.

36:41.144 --> 36:44.058
Either I admit to sleeping with Josh,
which didn't happen,

36:44.083 --> 36:46.921
or I expose that Cooper has
been sleeping with a protestor

36:46.946 --> 36:49.722
against the company.
It's his job or mine.

36:49.747 --> 36:51.560
Talk about a rock and a hard place.

36:51.585 --> 36:53.192
I'm not proud of my mistakes.

36:53.217 --> 36:56.753
But, I love that school, and I would
never do what I'm being accused of.

36:56.778 --> 36:59.211
- We believe you.
- So the Ellard Eight

36:59.236 --> 37:01.106
- isn't behind this?
- The Ellard Eight is just

37:01.131 --> 37:03.899
a kids' club.
An excuse to give a few students

37:03.924 --> 37:06.395
a false sense of power.
I haven't spoken to anybody

37:06.420 --> 37:09.207
- in that club for years.
- So, we're right back

37:09.232 --> 37:12.434
at square one and the board is
assembling at Ellard right now.

37:12.459 --> 37:14.659
Mary, I'm sorry.

37:15.785 --> 37:17.950
Shade...

37:21.043 --> 37:22.747
Why do you have

37:22.772 --> 37:25.489
framed articles from the Ellard paper?

37:25.752 --> 37:28.920
My daughter wrote them.
She goes to Ellard.

37:35.298 --> 37:38.072
- Miss Everett. Mr. Shade.
- Miss Sinclair was set up

37:38.097 --> 37:40.307
by The Ellard Eight's leader.
We just didn't know why until now.

37:40.331 --> 37:43.429
- Again with The Ellard Eight.
- They exist. We found their clubhouse.

37:43.454 --> 37:46.398
- You have the one responsible?
- We will in about ten minutes.

37:46.423 --> 37:48.756
- It's a delicate situation.
- It's too late.

37:48.781 --> 37:51.671
- I'm prepared for the board's decision.
- Is that your resignation?

37:51.696 --> 37:54.663
Better to resign gracefully
than trigger an unnecessary war.

37:54.688 --> 37:58.367
- Just give us the time we need.
- Ten minutes.

38:01.773 --> 38:04.106
Good, you're here.

38:04.131 --> 38:05.976
The Ellard Eight were
behind all of this?

38:06.001 --> 38:07.773
Just the current Number
One. We texted her

38:07.798 --> 38:10.687
on the PeriWink app.
She should be arriving any minute.

38:10.712 --> 38:12.783
She?

38:15.735 --> 38:17.836
Daddy?

38:17.861 --> 38:19.839
Brie, what's going on?

38:19.864 --> 38:22.550
They're saying you made
up this story about Mary.

38:23.586 --> 38:25.587
Honey, why?

38:25.612 --> 38:28.064
She's been your favourite
teacher for years!

38:28.089 --> 38:30.422
I'm not stupid, Dad.

38:30.447 --> 38:32.727
I know what's going on.

38:32.752 --> 38:35.054
I saw your texts to her.

38:35.079 --> 38:36.992
How could you do this to Mom?

38:37.025 --> 38:38.999
- God.
- How could you

38:39.024 --> 38:41.789
- do this to my family?
- Hey, it's not her fault, Brie.

38:41.814 --> 38:44.815
It's mine. Your mom and I, we...

38:45.546 --> 38:49.047
- we didn't...
- Does Mom know?

38:49.708 --> 38:51.608
Yes.

38:56.087 --> 38:58.188
We didn't know how to tell you.

38:58.229 --> 39:01.256
We were waiting for you to graduate.

39:02.319 --> 39:05.294
I just thought that...

39:05.319 --> 39:07.976
maybe if she was out of your life...

39:08.001 --> 39:10.765
you and Mom would stay together.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.852
It was stupid!

39:14.466 --> 39:17.188
I'm so sorry, honey.

39:17.476 --> 39:20.443
We should've told you.

39:45.092 --> 39:47.499
Mr. Houser and his wife
explained everything

39:47.524 --> 39:50.321
to the board,
including his relationship with Mary.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.710
The police are dropping
the investigation and Mary

39:52.735 --> 39:55.369
- is staying at the school.
- What about your resignation?

39:55.394 --> 39:58.329
- I didn't offer it.
- Good for you.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.690
What's gonna happen to Josh and Brie?

40:00.715 --> 40:03.930
Josh cheated on his exam,
and Brie blackmailed him for it,

40:03.955 --> 40:06.633
then led a smear campaign
against one of my teachers.

40:06.658 --> 40:08.697
Not exactly model students.

40:08.721 --> 40:12.070
- But Mary asked me to go easy on them.
- That sounds like her.

40:12.096 --> 40:15.149
They'll be suspended, but... officially,

40:15.174 --> 40:17.508
this was an act of The Ellard Eight.
And as we all know,

40:17.533 --> 40:19.860
they don't exist.

40:20.305 --> 40:22.554
Let me know if you'd like to sub again,
Miss Everett.

40:22.579 --> 40:24.255
I know the kids would be thrilled.

40:24.280 --> 40:27.470
Um, I... I could speak to the
students too if you'd like.

40:27.495 --> 40:30.162
That won't be necessary, but...

40:30.187 --> 40:33.607
- Thank you for your help.
- Yeah.

40:38.928 --> 40:41.575
- How is she doing?
- She'll be OK.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.302
- What did you say to her?
- I talked about

40:44.327 --> 40:46.655
what I went through with you and Mom.
When a family breaks apart,

40:46.679 --> 40:49.480
you have to look at the big picture.
Sometimes,

40:49.505 --> 40:51.658
you gain as much as you lose.

40:52.569 --> 40:54.502
She slipped me this.

40:54.527 --> 40:56.155
Looks like the Ellard
Eight is gonna need a new.

40:56.179 --> 40:58.482
- Number One next year.
- Just you,

40:58.507 --> 41:01.520
- not Liam, right?
- Maybe I'll

41:01.545 --> 41:03.772
- make him my Number Two!
- Just like Shade is to me.

41:03.797 --> 41:06.298
Very funny.

41:11.389 --> 41:14.819
- Listen, about Jules...
- It's OK.

41:14.844 --> 41:17.070
I'm glad she feels like she
can talk to you. I don't wanna

41:17.094 --> 41:20.505
get in the way of that.
As long as you're comfortable with it.

41:20.530 --> 41:24.381
Well, it surprised me too, but, also,

41:24.406 --> 41:26.967
- it's pretty cool.
- And I'm not promising

41:26.992 --> 41:29.125
it won't bother me,
but then, I won't ask.

41:29.150 --> 41:31.826
- I would expect nothing less.
- And you gotta promise

41:31.851 --> 41:33.827
to tell me if I should be
worried about something.

41:33.852 --> 41:36.327
You've nothing to worry about, Shade.

41:36.352 --> 41:38.753
You did a good job with her.

41:52.053 --> 41:55.434
What are you still doing here? Go home.

42:00.070 --> 42:03.039
- Zoe...
- I can explain.

42:03.064 --> 42:05.597
You fixed the door.

42:05.608 --> 42:10.037
- It doesn't stick anymore.
- No. No, it doesn't.

42:10.062 --> 42:12.287
I like things the way they are,
even if they're broken.

42:12.312 --> 42:15.035
Especially if they're broken.

42:15.325 --> 42:17.746
But I must say...

42:17.859 --> 42:20.331
an unstuck door isn't that bad.

42:20.356 --> 42:22.950
My God, I totally thought
you were gonna fire me!

42:22.975 --> 42:25.171
You know Shade's been on my
case to redesign this place.

42:25.195 --> 42:28.709
Maybe it's worth considering.
Do not tell him that I said that.

42:28.734 --> 42:30.926
Your secret is safe with me.

42:47.614 --> 42:51.748
So honey,
I was thinking about Brie and her dad.

42:51.938 --> 42:54.982
Is that how you felt when
me and your mom split up?

42:55.572 --> 42:58.452
It's weird. I guess...

42:58.477 --> 43:01.120
I appreciate it, you know. Like I see...

43:01.210 --> 43:03.991
you and Mom are better apart.
And I think the experience

43:04.016 --> 43:06.044
made me stronger.

43:07.186 --> 43:10.046
You're the strongest
person I know, sweetie.

43:10.071 --> 43:12.428
I'm turning on the TV.

43:14.251 --> 43:16.251
Do your thing.

43:16.766 --> 43:20.078
Extra Long Shorts passes
the ball the Buck Tooth.

43:20.197 --> 43:21.657
Buck Tooth heads down the court.

43:21.690 --> 43:23.532
He passes it to Long
Shorts for the lay up.

43:23.557 --> 43:25.478
No wait, he fakes it. He's gonna dunk.

43:25.503 --> 43:26.923
Buck Tooth scores!

43:26.948 --> 43:30.149
Woo!
