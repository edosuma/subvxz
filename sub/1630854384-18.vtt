But did you see him?
He was like...

09:45.537 --> 09:48.140
[Fatima] Hey, look,
Angela, it's all good.

09:48.140 --> 09:50.042
Okay.
Okay.

09:50.042 --> 09:51.176
I mean...

09:51.877 --> 09:54.112
You don't wanna come and stay
by me tonight,

09:54.112 --> 09:55.347
let him cool off?

09:55.781 --> 09:58.083
No, I'm good, I'm good.

09:58.650 --> 10:00.152
Okay.
And you're sure?

10:00.152 --> 10:02.454
-Yes, Angela, you can go home.
-[Angela] Okay.

10:02.454 --> 10:03.789
I mean...

10:03.789 --> 10:05.991
Girl, he was mad as hell.

10:05.991 --> 10:07.092
I know.

10:08.026 --> 10:09.161
It's fine.

10:10.362 --> 10:11.763
All right.

10:13.298 --> 10:15.000
He should be here any second.

10:16.268 --> 10:18.570
[Angela] And you think he's
gon' come straight home?

10:18.837 --> 10:19.905
He better!

10:20.839 --> 10:21.940
All right!

10:23.675 --> 10:25.143
[Fatima]<i> There he is,
right there.</i>

10:25.143 --> 10:27.746
[engine humming]

10:27.746 --> 10:28.880
[Angela]<i> Thank God.</i>

10:31.783 --> 10:33.718
-[Fatima]<i> Be safe gettin' home.
</i>-[Angela]<i> I will.</i>

10:33.718 --> 10:35.087

10:35.087 --> 10:37.089

10:37.089 --> 10:49.034
[music]

11:09.354 --> 11:15.494
[footsteps]

11:20.532 --> 11:22.767
Come here, let me see it.

11:26.571 --> 11:27.839
You happy?

11:29.074 --> 11:30.075
You proud of yourself?

11:31.143 --> 11:32.077
What?

11:33.278 --> 11:35.313
Don't come at me with that.
What are you talkin' about?

11:35.580 --> 11:37.482
Zac, why were you fighting him?

11:37.482 --> 11:39.384
Because he's always talkin'
shit to me!

11:39.384 --> 11:41.086
And he don't mind his business.

11:41.553 --> 11:43.088
No, Zac.

11:43.088 --> 11:45.157
You were fighting him because
you're mad with Karen.

11:45.157 --> 11:46.358
-[Zac] No.
-Yes!

11:46.358 --> 11:47.759
[Zac] No, I don't need
a therapist!

11:47.759 --> 11:49.928
I'm fighting him because he
always says shit to me.

11:49.928 --> 11:51.429
And he don't mind his business.

11:51.763 --> 11:53.498
All right, you make
it about that.

11:53.498 --> 11:54.599
That's what it's about!

11:55.033 --> 11:57.335
She come up in here every day,
causin' trouble.

11:57.335 --> 11:59.070
Bringin' shit to
our relationship.

11:59.070 --> 12:00.071
I'm tired of it.

12:00.071 --> 12:02.274
Zac, I told you.
She didn't do that.

12:02.674 --> 12:04.109
[Zac] Then who was it, Fatima?

12:04.109 --> 12:06.044
I told you, it's somebody
that Angela knows!

12:06.044 --> 12:07.112
Who?!

12:07.112 --> 12:08.480
-[Fatima]Don't worry about that!
-Exactly.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.915
You don't know who
it was, it was her.

12:09.915 --> 12:12.417
She was nice for no reason!
She never that nice to me!

12:12.417 --> 12:13.685
Then a picture pops up, and

12:13.685 --> 12:15.187
I'm supposed to believe
that it's not her?

12:15.187 --> 12:16.388
Come on.
I'm not stupid.

12:16.388 --> 12:17.956
Zac, you have a record!

12:17.956 --> 12:19.558
-He doesn't!
-And, and?!

12:20.125 --> 12:22.260
Okay, then you goin' back
to jail.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.528
Let me ask you a question!

12:23.528 --> 12:25.497
How come every time you
get pissed off,

12:25.497 --> 12:27.032
you get to just
storm outta here,

12:27.032 --> 12:30.135
put bitches' head through walls,
people almost die.

12:30.135 --> 12:32.804
But anytime I do somethin',
I get scolded like a child!

12:33.338 --> 12:35.240
As I said!

12:35.240 --> 12:36.741
You have a record, I don't!

12:36.741 --> 12:39.511
I don't know how!
To be honest, I don't.

12:39.511 --> 12:40.845
'Cause you way worse than me!

12:40.845 --> 12:42.314
-Whatever, Zac.
-[Zac] Whatever!

12:42.314 --> 12:43.548
-You know what?
-What?

12:43.548 --> 12:44.883
I'm goin' to bed.

12:44.883 --> 12:46.785
-I ain't got no time...
-Okay. You do that.

12:46.785 --> 12:48.153
On this couch.

12:50.021 --> 12:50.789
What?!

12:50.789 --> 12:51.923
You heard me!

12:52.490 --> 12:53.892
Fatima, quit playin' with me.

12:53.892 --> 12:55.160
Ain't nobody sittin' on
no couch, like...

12:55.160 --> 12:57.462
I ain't sleepin' on
no couch in my own house.

12:57.462 --> 12:59.197
I'm sorry, in what?

12:59.898 --> 13:02.901
I'm not sleepin' on no couch
in my own house!

13:02.901 --> 13:05.437
"My house".
Got it.

13:05.770 --> 13:06.805
[Zac] You got what?

13:06.805 --> 13:08.440
See, I was waitin' for this day.

13:08.807 --> 13:09.975
Waitin' on what?

13:09.975 --> 13:11.309
[Fatima] For you to start
talkin' all this

13:11.309 --> 13:12.444
"my house" shit.

13:12.444 --> 13:13.979
Come on, Fatima.
Chill out.

13:13.979 --> 13:14.946
No, Zac!

13:15.413 --> 13:16.548
[Zac] No what?

13:16.848 --> 13:18.483
You know what?
Cool.

13:18.483 --> 13:20.218
-I'm out.
-Uh-uh, where you goin'?

13:22.387 --> 13:23.888

13:23.888 --> 13:25.690
If you think I can't
find another bed to sleep in,

13:25.690 --> 13:27.192

13:27.192 --> 13:28.193
Come on, what are you,

13:39.704 --> 13:42.207
Wait, wait, wait, wait,

13:42.207 --> 13:43.475
That's how you feel?

13:43.475 --> 13:45.110
Yes, that's how I feel!

13:45.110 --> 13:46.878
Every time we get into
an argument, you runnin'!

13:46.878 --> 13:48.313
You gon' run every time!

13:48.313 --> 13:50.682

13:50.682 --> 13:52.183

13:52.183 --> 13:53.818

13:53.818 --> 13:55.754
in the same salon

13:55.754 --> 13:57.022
You need to,

13:57.022 --> 13:58.823
You don't tell me what the --
I need to do!

13:58.823 --> 13:59.991
You need to listen!

13:59.991 --> 14:01.359

-Are you?!

14:01.359 --> 14:02.427
Yes, I'm listening!

14:02.694 --> 14:04.296
But you ain't sayin' shit!

Go!

-Okay, it's okay...
-[Karen] What?!

15:02.562 --> 15:04.330
It's okay.
Yes, it's fine.

-What?!

15:16.442 --> 15:22.148
Look, someone took a picture
of you hugging Zac and...

15:23.116 --> 15:24.784
They saw it...

15:25.752 --> 15:27.820
I'm sorry...
What?

15:28.888 --> 15:29.856
Yes.

15:32.492 --> 15:33.826
You knew about this?

15:35.461 --> 15:36.763
Yes, I did.

15:38.131 --> 15:40.233
[Karen] 'Cause Fatima
told you 'bout this.

15:41.434 --> 15:42.735
Yes.

15:42.735 --> 15:44.637
And you didn't think to tell me?

15:45.638 --> 15:47.774
[Andi] No, Karen, I wasn't
gonna tell you...

15:47.774 --> 15:50.977
You weren't gonna tell me about
a picture that I was in?

15:51.411 --> 15:53.146
Why?!
Ain't we friends?!

15:53.146 --> 15:54.948
-[Andi] Karen, of course...
-No, you know what?!

15:54.948 --> 15:57.617
No, this chick gets around you
and all of a sudden...

15:57.617 --> 15:59.452
Okay, Karen,
you need to calm down.

15:59.452 --> 16:00.586
I'ma say it.
'Cause all of a sudden,

16:00.586 --> 16:01.688
you don't know how to act, Andi.

16:01.688 --> 16:04.123
-You don't.
-Karen, she has had my back!

16:04.123 --> 16:05.258
And so have I!

16:06.826 --> 16:09.729
Listen, I don't tell you what
she tells me,

16:09.729 --> 16:11.931
and I don't tell her what
you tell me!

16:11.931 --> 16:13.466
Oh, so there's probably more
I should know about.

16:13.466 --> 16:15.435
No, that is not what I'm saying!

16:15.435 --> 16:17.637
-Aaron, help me out!
-No, no!

16:18.471 --> 16:20.673
This is between me and you.

16:20.673 --> 16:22.308
He ain't got shit to
say about this!

16:22.308 --> 16:25.345
Well, I will talk to you
when you calm down!

16:25.611 --> 16:27.180
You won't talk to me at all.

16:27.180 --> 16:28.214
You don't mean that.

16:28.214 --> 16:30.016
Oh, don't tell me what
I mean, Andi.

16:30.016 --> 16:31.351
Don't.

16:31.351 --> 16:33.486
-Karen, be reasonable, okay?!
-[Karen] You know what?

16:33.486 --> 16:35.021
No, I'm not gonna
be reasonable, Andi!

16:35.021 --> 16:36.456
Because if you had told me
this shit,

16:36.456 --> 16:39.292
I coulda called him and told
him I didn't do that!

16:39.292 --> 16:41.194
Yes, and Karen, I just didn't
want to...

16:41.194 --> 16:42.929
What?!
What?!

16:43.596 --> 16:45.365
What you can do is get
the -- out!

16:45.365 --> 16:46.632
That's what you could do!

16:46.632 --> 16:47.800
-I didn't want to...
-[Karen] Get out!

16:47.800 --> 16:50.103
You betrayed me?!

16:51.204 --> 16:53.606
You don't wanna betray her,
but you betrayed me?!

16:53.606 --> 16:55.208
-[Andi] That's...
-Of all people?!

16:55.208 --> 16:56.376
Just let me speak!

16:56.376 --> 16:57.377
-Get out!
-Let me speak, Karen!

16:57.377 --> 16:58.444
-Just get out.
-Karen...

16:58.444 --> 16:59.345
-Okay.
-[Karen] Andi?

16:59.345 --> 17:01.147
You have to stay calm, okay?

17:01.614 --> 17:02.749
Don't do this.

17:02.749 --> 17:04.384
Get the -- out my house.

17:04.384 --> 17:05.985
Get out.
Get out, now.

17:05.985 --> 17:08.087
Exit my house.

-Hey, I'm sorry about all that.

17:23.603 --> 17:25.071
What the hell was that?

17:25.071 --> 17:26.072
I just...

17:26.072 --> 17:27.573
I just want
her to stay calm.

17:27.573 --> 17:29.075
I didn't want her...
to get upset.

17:29.075 --> 17:30.643
[Andi] You wanted her
to stay calm?

17:30.643 --> 17:31.811
You got words to say now, huh?

17:31.811 --> 17:32.912
No, it's just the baby and
everything,

17:32.912 --> 17:34.180
you know what I mean?

17:35.248 --> 17:37.216
It's okay, look.
I'll, I'll talk to her.

17:37.216 --> 17:38.317
All right?

17:38.317 --> 17:39.352
I know I could have handled
that better.

17:39.352 --> 17:40.353
You think?

17:40.953 --> 17:42.855
-I'll talk to her.
-She's not being reasonable!

17:42.855 --> 17:44.424
Yes, I understand that.
I understand that.

17:44.424 --> 17:46.192
Trust me, I'll talk to her,
I'll calm her down.

17:46.192 --> 17:48.127
And we'll talk about it in
the morning, okay?

17:48.127 --> 17:50.096
-Whatever, Aaron.
-Come on, just...

17:50.096 --> 17:51.931
Go home and get some rest.
All right?

17:51.931 --> 17:54.200
I'll talk to her, I will.
I'll have her call you.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.401
Okay?

17:59.338 --> 18:11.284
[music]

18:11.284 --> 18:12.418
You know I lost my job?

18:12.752 --> 18:14.153
[Danni] You'll get it back.

18:15.254 --> 18:16.189
No.

18:16.989 --> 18:19.158
I mean, once they find out
you didn't do any of this,

18:19.158 --> 18:20.493
yeah, you will.

18:20.493 --> 18:22.095
Mm-mm.

18:22.095 --> 18:24.030
Banking is a different animal.

18:26.132 --> 18:27.400
I lost it.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.935
I'm sorry.

18:32.105 --> 18:33.739
I don't know what
I'm gonna do now.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.441
Well, you do have the savings.

18:37.076 --> 18:38.211
I know.

18:38.678 --> 18:39.846
But that was...

18:39.846 --> 18:41.147
to buy my house.

18:43.249 --> 18:44.283
Yeah, I know.

18:48.087 --> 18:50.389
How did this happen
all of a sudden?

18:51.624 --> 18:54.427
Sabrina...
This is all Maurice.

18:55.428 --> 18:56.896
I know, but...

18:57.763 --> 18:59.966
Just take it one day
at a time, okay?

19:00.399 --> 19:01.734
I'm trying.

19:03.536 --> 19:04.937
[Danni] Yeah.

19:05.605 --> 19:06.772
What?

19:06.772 --> 19:08.141
Hm?

19:08.141 --> 19:09.842
[Sabrina] Why do you keep
lookin' at your phone?

19:09.842 --> 19:12.345
Oh, I...
I did, yeah.

19:12.712 --> 19:14.046
Do you wanna go home?

19:14.046 --> 19:16.115
[Danni] No, no, no.
I'm here to check on you.

19:17.216 --> 19:19.318
Or did you wanna talk
about Preston?

19:20.353 --> 19:23.055
No, we talked about that.

19:23.623 --> 19:24.957
I know we talked about it,

19:24.957 --> 19:26.792
but you don't wanna say
anything else?

19:28.294 --> 19:29.395
No.

19:30.563 --> 19:31.831
Know what?

19:32.598 --> 19:34.333
I will just go home.

19:34.901 --> 19:36.469
How you gonna get there?

19:36.469 --> 19:39.005
[Danni] Oh, that's honestly why
I was lookin' at my phone.

19:39.005 --> 19:40.540
Just tryin' to call a car.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.241
I can give you a ride.

19:42.608 --> 19:43.676
I got it.

19:43.676 --> 19:44.911
[Sabrina] Are you sure?

19:45.478 --> 19:46.445
Yeah.

19:47.446 --> 19:48.447
Okay.

19:49.348 --> 19:51.050
Do you know when you're gonna
get your car back?

19:51.050 --> 19:54.487
Tryin' to see if it's totaled.
<i>It's totaled.</i>

19:54.487 --> 19:55.788
[Sabrina] Sorry.

19:55.788 --> 19:58.191
Yeah...
Well...

19:58.191 --> 19:59.325
I love you.

19:59.325 --> 20:00.326
I love you, too.

20:00.326 --> 20:01.794
[Danni] I will call you
tomorrow.

20:01.794 --> 20:02.929
Thanks for comin' by.

20:02.929 --> 20:03.930
[Danni] Of course.

20:03.930 --> 20:05.565
Oh, and do me a favor...

20:06.232 --> 20:09.235
Don't you dare say anything
about the wine, Danni.

20:09.235 --> 20:12.471
Even I couldn't touch
this cheap shit, so...

20:12.838 --> 20:16.442
Who made it?
Is this a Jim Jones exclusive?

20:16.442 --> 20:17.643
Danni...

20:17.643 --> 20:19.111
That is a horrible tragedy.

20:19.111 --> 20:21.047
You should not be making
fun of that.

20:21.047 --> 20:22.515
I wasn't making fun of it.

20:22.515 --> 20:26.852
I was makin' fun of you.
And this cheap-ass wine.

20:27.820 --> 20:30.289
You can see yourself out,
Danni, thank you.

20:30.289 --> 20:33.859
And I gotta tell you,
I love this Wakanda fashion.

20:33.859 --> 20:35.528
French.

20:37.363 --> 20:41.067
[vocalizing]

20:43.603 --> 20:45.338
I'm sorry, this is bad.

20:46.105 --> 20:47.607
Bye.

20:47.607 --> 20:57.216
[music]

21:01.721 --> 21:05.057
[phone ringing]

21:06.892 --> 21:07.860
Hey.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.195
[Que]<i> What's up?</i>

21:10.796 --> 21:12.865
Can you come over?

21:12.865 --> 21:14.133
[Que]<i> Yeah.</i>

21:14.934 --> 21:16.602
Sure you're not gonna
go to jail?

21:16.602 --> 21:17.937
[Que]<i> No.</i>

21:19.071 --> 21:20.473
Okay, well...

21:20.840 --> 21:22.308
I'm on my way home...

21:23.476 --> 21:24.877
You can come over.

21:25.378 --> 21:26.545
[Que]<i> On my way.</i>

21:26.545 --> 21:28.714
Wait, wait, wait, you got
the address already?

21:29.649 --> 21:32.018
[Que]<i> I assumed you'll text me
the address.</i>

21:32.618 --> 21:35.721
Okay, yeah, I will.
Bye.

21:35.721 --> 21:37.823
[Que]<i> Bye.
See you in a bit.</i>

21:37.823 --> 21:40.760
[music]

21:40.760 --> 21:44.363
[crickets chirping]

21:44.363 --> 21:46.499
Aaron?

21:46.499 --> 21:48.134
Can you come in here?

21:48.567 --> 21:49.568
[Aaron]<i> Yeah.</i>

21:55.675 --> 21:57.009
You okay?

21:57.743 --> 21:59.111
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:00.479 --> 22:01.981
I'm so sorry about that.

22:03.282 --> 22:04.617
It's all right, really.

22:05.318 --> 22:07.553
That much about him
hasn't changed.

22:08.187 --> 22:09.588
Does he always act like that?

22:10.890 --> 22:12.658
When he feels like he's been
wronged.

22:12.925 --> 22:14.160
[Aaron] Yeah, but he wasn't
wronged.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.262
I know.
I didn't do anything to him.

22:16.262 --> 22:18.130
I was just...
bein' nice.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.765
Yeah, I know.

22:19.765 --> 22:22.735
I mean, he came to the salon.
I didn't invite him or nothin'.

22:23.102 --> 22:24.403
[Aaron] It's really okay.

22:25.538 --> 22:26.672
Really.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.208
Did he hurt you?

22:29.208 --> 22:31.377
[Aaron] Nah, it's all right.

22:31.377 --> 22:33.946
Aaron, you don't have to act
all macho.

22:34.914 --> 22:36.082
Karen, it's all right.

22:36.082 --> 22:37.516
I mean, he got
a few licks in,

22:37.516 --> 22:38.784
but I'm fine.

22:38.784 --> 22:40.553
-I'm so sorry, really, I am.
-[Aaron] It's all right.

22:41.187 --> 22:42.988
Trust me, okay?

22:45.324 --> 22:48.394
I should probably apologize
to Andi.

22:49.862 --> 22:50.996
[Aaron] Well...

22:52.598 --> 22:53.566
What?

22:54.500 --> 22:55.735
Yeah, you should.

22:56.369 --> 22:58.938
Okay, I know.
I know.

22:58.938 --> 23:00.373
[Aaron] I mean, she was
really hurt.

23:00.373 --> 23:01.841
Okay, but I was hurt, too!

23:01.841 --> 23:03.008
She didn't tell me about that!

23:03.008 --> 23:04.577
Okay...

23:04.577 --> 23:06.679
You still could've handled that
differently, you know?

23:08.614 --> 23:09.682
I know.

23:10.783 --> 23:12.518
I saw it in her eyes,
I mean...

23:14.453 --> 23:15.988
I'll apologize.

23:16.856 --> 23:18.190
Yeah.

23:18.190 --> 23:20.993
Look, I don't wanna be jealous
of Fatima.

23:20.993 --> 23:22.094
I'm not.

23:22.094 --> 23:23.596
[Aaron] I know.

23:23.596 --> 23:24.630
But...

23:24.630 --> 23:26.932
I mean, she's made
a move with my ex,

23:26.932 --> 23:28.534
and all my friends, I mean...

23:28.534 --> 23:29.568
It's just...

23:29.568 --> 23:31.704
It's a lot, it's a lot, Aaron.
Okay?

23:32.705 --> 23:34.173
Yes, I understand that.

23:36.075 --> 23:37.943
[Karen] Am I bein' unreasonable?

23:37.943 --> 23:39.345
Karen...

23:39.879 --> 23:41.414
Look.

23:41.414 --> 23:43.716
-You're not bein' unreasonable.
-So, what is this, then?

23:44.450 --> 23:47.052
It's just been a lot, okay?
You've been through a lot.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.555
You're just bein'
human right now.

23:49.555 --> 23:50.556
It's okay.

23:53.125 --> 23:54.460
It's okay.

23:56.796 --> 23:58.497
I'll call her in the mornin'.

23:59.899 --> 24:01.534
I think that's a good idea.

24:02.301 --> 24:05.204
Now, I just wanna rest.

24:06.405 --> 24:08.707
I think that's an even
better idea.

24:10.943 --> 24:12.278
[Karen] What a day.

24:13.612 --> 24:14.680
[Aaron] What a day.

24:15.181 --> 24:17.016
Oh, shit!

24:17.016 --> 24:18.217
What?

24:18.217 --> 24:19.819
Pam, she ain't send me
the video.

24:20.286 --> 24:21.787
Karen, it's okay.

24:21.787 --> 24:23.155
No, no, no, I gotta call her.

24:23.155 --> 24:24.924
-Hold on, let me call her.
-I'm sure she got it.

24:24.924 --> 24:25.991
You don't have to
worry about it.

24:25.991 --> 24:27.259
Karen, come...

24:27.259 --> 24:29.762
[phone ringing]

24:30.905 --> 24:32.039
Pam?

24:32.039 --> 24:33.841
[Pam]<i> I knew you'd be calling.</i>

24:33.841 --> 24:35.576
You never sent me the video.

24:35.843 --> 24:37.345
'Cause I'm still here!

24:37.345 --> 24:38.879
[Karen]<i> Why are you still
at the salon?</i>

24:38.879 --> 24:41.182
'Cause Devon is with a client.

24:41.182 --> 24:43.651
Why does he take so long
with 'em?

24:43.651 --> 24:45.986
[Pam]<i> 'Cause he know
he better have that booth rent.</i>

24:45.986 --> 24:47.421
Hm, okay.

24:47.421 --> 24:50.591
I'll send you the video
as soon as they leave!

24:50.591 --> 24:51.625
[Karen]<i> Okay.</i>

24:51.625 --> 24:52.793
Well, hold on!

24:52.793 --> 24:53.828
<i>Karen.</i>

24:53.828 --> 24:55.229
Yes?

24:55.229 --> 24:56.797
[Pam]<i> I heard about
the restaurant...</i>

24:56.797 --> 24:58.265
Pam.

24:58.265 --> 25:00.267
[Pam]<i> You do know Zac
goin' to Hell, right?</i>

25:00.267 --> 25:01.469
Why would you say that?

25:01.469 --> 25:05.005
Hittin' one of
the Lord's messengers?

25:05.005 --> 25:06.974
[Karen]<i> Okay, Pam,
you know what?</i>

25:06.974 --> 25:08.509
That's some bullshit, you know.

25:08.509 --> 25:10.711
Can you just send me the video
before you leave?

25:10.711 --> 25:11.846
[Pam]<i> I got it.</i>

25:11.846 --> 25:13.080
Okay.

25:13.714 --> 25:15.316
I have to go.

25:15.316 --> 25:17.551
[Pam]<i> Sure, and I will be
a little late in the morning.</i>

25:17.852 --> 25:18.886
Why?

25:18.886 --> 25:20.755
Because I'm here this late!

25:20.755 --> 25:21.756
[Karen]<i> Pam!</i>

25:21.756 --> 25:23.758
Why?
You can't come open?

25:23.758 --> 25:25.693
I have to get some rest.

25:25.693 --> 25:27.194
[sighing]

25:27.194 --> 25:29.430
[Pam]<i> Then what am I to do
for my beauty rest?</i>

25:29.430 --> 25:31.599
Fine.
I'll come in.

25:31.599 --> 25:33.067
Thank you.

25:33.067 --> 25:34.502
[Karen]<i> I'll see you at 11.</i>

25:34.502 --> 25:36.003
Okay, I'll see you at four.

25:36.003 --> 25:38.172
-Pam.
-[Pam]<i> I'm just playin', girl.</i>

25:44.812 --> 25:46.380
E-leven.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.048
[Karen]<i> Okay, thank you.</i>

25:48.048 --> 25:49.650
<i>And send the video, okay?</i>

25:49.650 --> 25:50.785
All right, I got it!

25:50.785 --> 25:52.186
All right.
Goodnight.

25:52.186 --> 25:54.622
-[Pam]<i> Bye!
-</i> Shit.

25:54.622 --> 25:57.425
<i>Damn, her ass be micromanaging
the shit outta me!</i>

25:57.792 --> 25:59.794
I'm still on the line!

26:00.828 --> 26:02.196
Sorry, girl!

26:02.797 --> 26:04.098
Just playin'.

26:07.635 --> 26:09.303
This woman...

26:09.303 --> 26:11.105
[Aaron] So, is that all right?

26:11.105 --> 26:13.240
God, I don't even know.

26:13.707 --> 26:15.743
Shit.

26:17.244 --> 26:18.612
Can I get you anything?

26:19.380 --> 26:22.016
A new life.

Thank you.

Hey, girl.

26:42.770 --> 26:43.904
Hey.

26:43.904 --> 26:45.239
[Andi]<i> How are you?</i>

26:45.573 --> 26:46.507
Not good.

26:46.507 --> 26:47.741
[Andi]<i> Of course, um...</i>

26:47.741 --> 26:49.743
-<i> How's Zac?
</i>-Girl, he's mad as hell.

26:50.077 --> 26:52.146
-I know.
-[Fatima]<i> Look...</i>

26:52.146 --> 26:53.781
<i>I'mma stay at a hotel tonight.</i>

26:53.781 --> 26:56.150
<i>So I was just callin' to let yu
know I'm gonna be late tomorrow.</i>

26:56.150 --> 26:57.017
A hotel?

26:57.885 --> 27:00.721
Fatima, come over here!
I have three extra bedrooms!

27:01.589 --> 27:03.691
-You sure, Andi?
-[Andi]<i> I am sure.</i>

27:03.691 --> 27:04.825

I'll have the concierge
let you up, okay?

27:09.730 --> 27:11.532
[Fatima]<i> All right.
I'm on my way.</i>

27:11.532 --> 27:13.534
Okay.
What's your ETA?

27:14.201 --> 27:15.469
Shouldn't be long.

27:15.469 --> 27:17.238
[Andi]<i> Okay, perfect.
I'll see you soon.</i>

27:17.238 --> 27:18.606

Hi.

Hey.

27:26.113 --> 27:28.782
I'm sorry about today.

27:30.117 --> 27:31.552
It's all good.

27:32.853 --> 27:34.388
No, it's not.

Well, I wanted to let you
know...

27:40.594 --> 27:42.596
I saw Gary at the restaurant.

27:43.797 --> 27:44.865
What?

27:45.332 --> 27:46.834
[Robin]<i> </i>Yeah.

27:48.302 --> 27:49.637
What was he doin' there?

27:50.304 --> 27:51.772
I have no idea.

27:54.275 --> 27:55.509
Hmm...

27:55.509 --> 27:57.611
Let me find out
he's following me.

27:58.479 --> 28:00.381
[Robin] I don't know that he is.

28:01.248 --> 28:03.317
I wouldn't put it past him.

28:04.952 --> 28:06.554
And you think that's okay?

28:08.222 --> 28:09.957
I think I can handle it.

28:12.526 --> 28:13.494
Okay.

28:15.296 --> 28:17.698
Well, I talked to him about
what he's up to.

28:18.532 --> 28:20.467
I told him I had the money.

28:22.269 --> 28:23.704
Why'd you do that?

28:24.405 --> 28:25.906
Mess with his head.

28:27.308 --> 28:29.243
And do you think that was wise?

28:30.711 --> 28:32.379
What do you mean?
The money's there.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.548
There's nothing he can do.

28:35.983 --> 28:37.851
I wouldn't underestimate Gary.

28:38.118 --> 28:39.954
He's very cunning.

28:42.122 --> 28:44.592
I know he is.
But I got him.

28:46.060 --> 28:47.027
[Andi] Okay.

29:04.345 --> 29:05.512
Thank you.

29:06.914 --> 29:08.082
[Robin] For what?

29:08.415 --> 29:09.984
For that one drink.

29:12.453 --> 29:14.755
No problem.
You're welcome.

29:14.755 --> 29:16.857
No, seriously, thank you

I don't trust you.

30:46.113 --> 30:48.549
So, what I gotta do to make
you comfortable?

30:49.316 --> 30:50.918
[Danni] Just sit here and talk.

30:51.685 --> 30:52.986
Okay.

30:55.456 --> 30:57.091
So, what happened?

What, what could that even mean?

31:04.298 --> 31:06.934
What makes you don't trust men?

31:08.168 --> 31:09.470
I trust some men.

31:09.470 --> 31:11.405
Mm-hm...

31:11.405 --> 31:13.240

more careful.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.808

31:16.643 --> 31:20.180
As you're sitting here with
an ankle monitor on.

31:23.550 --> 31:25.619
Oh, what am I doing?

31:25.619 --> 31:28.522
I gotta stop smokin'

39:40.697 --> 39:42.132
What happened?

39:42.132 --> 39:43.433
You're safe?
You didn't...?

39:43.433 --> 39:45.369
No, Zac went off.

39:46.236 --> 39:48.038
I wanted him to sleep on
the sofa tonight,

39:48.038 --> 39:50.040
and he started talkin' 'bout
his house this,

39:50.040 --> 39:51.408
and his house that.

39:52.075 --> 39:53.544
Not his house.

39:53.877 --> 39:55.245
[Fatima] Girl, yes.

39:55.779 --> 39:57.247
And you wanna see me walk?

39:57.247 --> 39:58.882
[Andi] I'm already knowin'.

39:58.882 --> 40:00.651
Have a man invite me into
his house,

40:00.651 --> 40:01.919
talkin' 'bout it's for us...

40:01.919 --> 40:04.221
And then start talkin' about
it's his house.

40:06.356 --> 40:08.325
-[Fatima] No, sir.
-No, sir.

40:09.426 --> 40:10.561
Not at all.

40:11.562 --> 40:13.130
I'm sorry.

40:16.567 --> 40:17.568
Okay.

40:18.268 --> 40:19.736
Okay.
It's fine.

40:19.736 --> 40:21.104
Well, you're here now.

40:21.104 --> 40:22.906
Yeah, I'm goin' back to
my apartment tomorrow,

40:22.906 --> 40:24.474
so better square that away.

40:24.841 --> 40:26.076
Okay, just...

40:26.076 --> 40:27.578
Let's think about this
for a second.

40:28.645 --> 40:31.048
Now, was the fight that serious?

40:31.048 --> 40:33.150
Yes, it was.

40:34.818 --> 40:36.086
No, Andi.

40:36.086 --> 40:38.288
No, you guys are...
Listen.

40:38.288 --> 40:39.456
Okay?

40:39.456 --> 40:42.626
You guys are happy together.
Remember that.

40:44.494 --> 40:45.495
No.

40:45.495 --> 40:46.997
This is...

40:52.069 --> 40:53.437
You took the ring off.

40:55.372 --> 40:57.241
Yeah, I left it on
the kitchen counter.

40:57.241 --> 40:59.743
I'm not playin' with him.

40:59.743 --> 41:02.412
Okay. Okay.

41:02.412 --> 41:05.082
Just...
Listen to me for a second.

41:06.116 --> 41:10.387
You cannot let Karen get
between you two.

41:10.387 --> 41:12.322
[Fatima] Just...

41:16.793 --> 41:20.631
Yes...
Please don't.

41:20.631 --> 41:22.599
[music]

41:22.599 --> 41:23.967
Really?

41:28.506 --> 41:29.807
I am sick of it!

41:29.807 --> 41:31.275
[Narrator]<i> Next, on Sistas.</i>

41:31.275 --> 41:33.410
I'm sorry.
I was mad, okay?

41:33.410 --> 41:35.012
Yeah, but that doesn't
give you a reason

41:35.012 --> 41:36.213
to talk to me like that, Zac.

41:36.213 --> 41:37.782
Yeah, he got a loan from
a gangster.

41:37.782 --> 41:38.983
It was a Harry-Wells lend.

41:38.983 --> 41:40.184
I think we wrecked him.

41:40.184 --> 41:41.385
<i>Andi wrecked him.</i>

41:41.385 --> 41:43.254
I can't believe she would
do this to me.

41:43.254 --> 41:44.054
Damn.

41:44.655 --> 41:46.524
You always look
this beautiful in the morning?

41:47.124 --> 41:49.026
Maybe he might give
her the money

41:49.026 --> 41:50.261
to get you out.

41:50.261 --> 41:51.662
What?!

41:52.062 --> 41:53.330
I love you so much.

41:53.898 --> 41:55.032
Do you?
