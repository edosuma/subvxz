>> John: HI, THERE, WELCOME TO

00:30.866 --> 00:33.300
THE SHOW, STILL FOR JUST THREE

00:33.366 --> 00:34.300
MORE WEEKS TAKING PLACE IN THIS

00:34.366 --> 00:36.100
BLANK VOID, WHICH I RECENTLY

00:36.166 --> 00:40.066
LEARNED IS SENTIENT.

00:40.133 --> 00:43.233
IT'S BEEN LISTENING A LOT TO ME,

00:43.300 --> 00:44.133
SO I THOUGHT

00:44.200 --> 00:45.233
I WOULD GIVE IT THE FLOOR FOR A

00:45.300 --> 00:46.133
MOMENT.

00:46.200 --> 00:46.800
VOID, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU

00:46.866 --> 00:48.266
WOULD LIKE TO SAY?

00:48.333 --> 00:49.366
>> REALLY?

00:49.433 --> 00:50.400
I CAN SAY ANYTHING I WANT?

00:50.466 --> 00:51.133
>> John: GO AHEAD, SPEAK YOUR

00:51.200 --> 00:52.000
MIND.

00:52.066 --> 00:52.800
>> OKAY.

00:52.866 --> 00:53.733
WOW.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.600
I WISH CHRIS PRATT WASN'T TRYING

00:54.666 --> 00:55.500
TO MAKE THE ACTION HERO THING

00:55.566 --> 00:59.133
STICK.

00:59.200 --> 00:59.700
YOU KNOW?

00:59.766 --> 01:00.533
>> John: UH-HUH.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.533
>> IT'S HIS CAREER, HE CAN DO

01:01.600 --> 01:02.800
WHATEVER HE WANTS WITH IT.

01:02.866 --> 01:04.133
I JUST FEEL LIKE THE BUFF THING,

01:04.200 --> 01:08.133
IT'S NOT WORKING FOR ME.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.666
>> John: OKAY, I'VE GOT TO BE

01:09.733 --> 01:09.900
HONEST.

01:09.966 --> 01:11.066
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE MORE

01:11.133 --> 01:11.633
INTERESTING THAN THIS.

01:11.700 --> 01:12.666
>> EXCUSE ME?

01:12.733 --> 01:13.600
YOU ASK SOMEONE ON THEIR SHOW

01:13.666 --> 01:15.033
AND TELL THEM TO SAY WHATEVER

01:15.100 --> 01:15.300
THEY WANT.

01:15.366 --> 01:15.933
THEY CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT,

01:16.000 --> 01:16.566
AND THEN YOU TELL THEM THEY ARE

01:16.633 --> 01:17.333
NOT INTERESTING?

01:17.400 --> 01:18.066
WHO DOES THAT?

01:18.133 --> 01:19.466
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER DOES THAT?

01:19.533 --> 01:22.900
>> John: THAT IS FAIR.

01:22.966 --> 01:25.066
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:25.133 --> 01:26.133
I SEE WHY YOU STOPPED HAVING

01:26.200 --> 01:27.133
GUESTS ON ON SEASON ONE.

01:27.200 --> 01:27.766

01:27.833 --> 01:28.800

01:28.866 --> 01:32.333

TUCKER CARLSON CELEBRATED

01:34.466 --> 01:34.733
INTERNATIONAL

01:34.800 --> 01:35.366
AUTHORITARIAN APPRECIATION WEEK

01:35.433 --> 01:36.100
BY DOING A ROAD-SHOW IN HUNGARY,

01:36.166 --> 01:36.933
O.J. SIMPSON URGED PEOPLE TO GET

01:37.000 --> 01:37.933
VACCINATED, PUTTING ME IN THE

01:38.000 --> 01:38.766
STRANGE POSITION OF SAYING "I'M

01:38.833 --> 01:40.533
WITH O.J.," AND NEW YORK'S AG

01:40.600 --> 01:43.800
RELEASED A DEVASTATING REPORT

01:43.866 --> 01:47.166
OF HIS INVESTIGATION INTO

01:47.233 --> 01:47.466
ALLEGATIONS

01:47.533 --> 01:49.433
DEVASTATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT BY

01:49.500 --> 01:51.033
ANDREW CUOMO WHICH, INCREDIBLY,

01:51.100 --> 01:52.133
HE IS TRYING TO RIDE OUT, TRYING

01:52.200 --> 01:53.666
TO DOWNPLAY THE ACCUSATIONS.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.100
>> I DO KISS PEOPLE ON THE

01:55.166 --> 01:56.066
FOREHEAD.

01:56.133 --> 01:57.733
I DO KISS PEOPLE ON THE CHEEK.

01:57.800 --> 01:59.200
I DO KISS PEOPLE ON THE HAND.

01:59.266 --> 02:03.000
I DO EMBRACE PEOPLE.

02:03.066 --> 02:06.000
I DO HUG PEOPLE, MEN AND WOMEN.

02:06.066 --> 02:07.500
>> John: OKAY!

02:07.566 --> 02:10.033
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS

02:10.100 --> 02:10.866
ABOUT.

02:10.933 --> 02:11.733
AND IT'S FRANKLY INCREDIBLE THAT

02:11.800 --> 02:12.733
CUOMO THOUGHT RELEASING AN

02:12.800 --> 02:14.033
IRRELEVANT MONTAGE OF PHOTOS

02:14.100 --> 02:15.133
WOULD SOMEHOW EXONERATE HIM.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.200
APPARENTLY HIS STRATEGY FOR

02:16.266 --> 02:17.400
LITERALLY ANY CRISIS IS

02:17.466 --> 02:19.166
"PUT TOGETHER A POWERPOINT AND

02:19.233 --> 02:20.433
THAT'S IT."

02:20.500 --> 02:22.166
BUT THE REST OF THE WORLD'S

02:22.233 --> 02:22.766
ATTENTION WAS DOMINATED THIS

02:22.833 --> 02:24.500
WEEK BY THE OLYMPICS.

02:24.566 --> 02:26.500
THEY ENDED TONIGHT AND THEY

02:26.566 --> 02:29.766
PROVIDED SOME INCREDIBLE MOMENTS

02:29.833 --> 02:31.500
FROM THE ATHLETES, BUT ALSO SOME

02:31.566 --> 02:32.466
CONTROVERSY FROM THE FACT

02:32.533 --> 02:33.133
THE GAMES WERE EVEN HAPPENING IN

02:33.200 --> 02:33.766
THE FIRST PLACE, IN THE MIDDLE

02:33.833 --> 02:38.833
OF A PANDEMIC, TO A DECISION

02:38.900 --> 02:39.600
TAKEN BEFORE THEY BEGAN

02:39.666 --> 02:40.466
REGARDING ONE OF THE TEAMS

02:40.533 --> 02:41.566
INVOLVED.

02:41.633 --> 02:43.200
>> IN OTHER OLYMPIC NEWS THIS

02:43.266 --> 02:43.966
MORNING, RUSSIA IS COMPETING

02:44.033 --> 02:44.600
UNDER A NEW NAME AT THESE

02:44.666 --> 02:45.533
OLYMPICS FOLLOWING THEIR DOPING

02:45.600 --> 02:46.466
SCANDAL.

02:46.533 --> 02:47.266
THEY'LL BE COMPETING AS THE

02:47.333 --> 02:48.300
"RUSSIAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE."

02:48.366 --> 02:50.533
THE RUSSIAN NAME, FLAG, AND

02:50.600 --> 02:51.633
ANTHEM HAVE ALL BEEN BANNED IF

02:51.700 --> 02:53.166
ATHLETES DO WIN ANY MEDALS.

02:53.233 --> 02:54.433
>> John: YEAH, THOUGH THE

02:54.500 --> 02:55.733
RUSSIAN NAME ISN'T REALLY BANNED

02:55.800 --> 02:58.866
IF THEY'RE COMPETING AS THE

02:58.933 --> 02:59.533
"RUSSIAN" OLYMPIC COMMITTEE, IS

02:59.600 --> 03:00.266
IT?

03:00.333 --> 03:01.433
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "A MONSTER

03:01.500 --> 03:02.366
LIKE HARVEY WEINSTEIN HAS

03:02.433 --> 03:04.533
ABSOLUTELY NO AFFILIATION WITH

03:04.600 --> 03:06.100
THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY."

03:06.166 --> 03:07.466
I DUNNO ABOUT THAT.

03:07.533 --> 03:08.433
THE NAME THERE REALLY IMPLIES

03:08.500 --> 03:10.366
OTHERWISE.

03:10.433 --> 03:11.400
THE NEW DESIGNATION IS DUE TO

03:11.466 --> 03:12.733
THE FACT THAT RUSSIA WAS

03:12.800 --> 03:13.833
TECHNICALLY BANNED FOR OPERATING

03:13.900 --> 03:15.166
A YEARS-LONG, STATE-SPONSORED

03:15.233 --> 03:16.500
DOPING SCHEME, AND THIS ISN'T

03:16.566 --> 03:18.000
THE FIRST TIME THEY'VE BEEN

03:18.066 --> 03:19.566
SANCTIONED.

03:19.633 --> 03:20.833
IN PYEONGCHANG IN 2018, RUSSIAN

03:20.900 --> 03:22.266
ATHLETES HAD TO COMPETE UNDER

03:22.333 --> 03:23.433
THIS NEUTRAL BANNER INSTEAD OF

03:23.500 --> 03:25.666
THEIR FLAG.

03:25.733 --> 03:26.900
BUT BEFORE TOKYO, THE PUNISHMENT

03:26.966 --> 03:28.066
WAS DOWNGRADED, AND THEY WERE

03:28.133 --> 03:29.733
ALLOWED TO COMPETE AS THE

03:29.800 --> 03:31.200
"RUSSIAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE" WITH

03:31.266 --> 03:32.533
UNIFORMS THAT CLEARLY BEAR MORE

03:32.600 --> 03:34.333
THAN A PASSING RESEMBLANCE TO

03:34.400 --> 03:36.266
THE RUSSIAN FLAG.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.266
WE ALL KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON

03:38.333 --> 03:39.666
THERE, IN THE SAME WAY THAT

03:39.733 --> 03:41.100
CALLING THIS A RED PLUMBER

03:41.166 --> 03:42.433
HALLOWEEN COSTUME ISN'T FOOLING

03:42.500 --> 03:43.800
ANYONE.

03:43.866 --> 03:45.033
AND WHILE WINNING RUSSIAN

03:45.100 --> 03:46.366
ATHLETES DIDN'T GET TO HEAR

03:46.433 --> 03:47.966
THEIR NATIONAL ANTHEM ON THE

03:48.033 --> 03:50.033
MEDAL STAND, THEY DID GET THIS:

03:50.100 --> 03:51.700
[TCHAIKOVSKY'S PIANO CONCERTO

03:51.766 --> 03:53.800
NO. 1]

03:53.866 --> 04:06.700
♪ ♪

04:06.766 --> 04:07.900
YEAH, THEY GOT TCHAIKOVSKY.

04:07.966 --> 04:08.900
THAT IS MORE RUSSIAN THAN THE

04:08.966 --> 04:10.866
RUSSIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM.

04:10.933 --> 04:12.400
IN FACT, THERE IS NO SOUND MORE

04:12.466 --> 04:13.866
QUINTESSENTIALLY RUSSIAN, ASIDE

04:13.933 --> 04:15.300
FROM MAYBE AN OLD MAN WEEPING

04:15.366 --> 04:16.833
UNCONTROLLABLY WHILE EATING A

04:16.900 --> 04:18.666
POTATO.

04:18.733 --> 04:20.266
IF ANYTHING, IT SEEMS RUSSIA

04:20.333 --> 04:24.066
EMBRACED THE R.O.C. DESIGNATION

04:24.133 --> 04:24.966
DURING THESE GAMES, WITH THE

04:25.033 --> 04:25.866
OFFICIAL @Russia ACCOUNT EVEN

04:25.933 --> 04:27.133
RUNNING A CAMPAIGN USING THE

04:27.200 --> 04:28.733
HASHTAG #WeWillRocYou.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.433
AND YOU DON'T GET TO USE

04:30.500 --> 04:35.600
"R.O.C." AS A FUN, SASSY NAME!

04:35.666 --> 04:36.900
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR

04:36.966 --> 04:37.433
PUNISHMENT.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.666
IT'S LIKE IF HANNIBAL LECTER

04:38.733 --> 04:40.033
STARTED TWEETING #MuzzleMeDaddy.

04:40.100 --> 04:40.533
NO!

04:40.600 --> 04:41.466
YOU EAT PEOPLE.

04:41.533 --> 04:42.266
YOU DON'T GET TO RECLAIM THE

04:42.333 --> 04:44.400
MUZZLE.

04:44.466 --> 04:45.600
THE THING IS, THESE

04:45.666 --> 04:47.000
DESIGNATIONS WERE PUT IN PLACE

04:47.066 --> 04:48.500
FOR A REASON -- BUT THAT REASON

04:48.566 --> 04:50.133
IS NOT SOMETHING THE R.O.C.'S

04:50.200 --> 04:53.733
BEEN EAGER TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

04:53.800 --> 04:54.333
AFTER A U.S. SWIMMER INITIALLY

04:54.400 --> 04:55.533
SUGGESTED HIS RACE "WAS PROBABLY

04:55.600 --> 04:56.766
NOT CLEAN," THE R.O.C. -- WHOSE

04:56.833 --> 04:58.233
ATHLETE HAD WON THAT RACE --

04:58.300 --> 05:00.566
RESPONDED AGGRESSIVELY:

05:00.633 --> 05:02.333
>> THE RUSSIAN OLYMPIC COMMITTEE

05:02.400 --> 05:03.766
HAVE RESPONDED VIA A STRONGLY

05:03.833 --> 05:05.133
WORDED STATEMENT ON TWITTER

05:05.200 --> 05:06.366
WHICH SAYS, IN PART, "HOW

05:06.433 --> 05:07.500
UNNERVING OUR VICTORIES ARE FOR

05:07.566 --> 05:08.666
SOME.

05:08.733 --> 05:09.800
YES, WE ARE HERE AT THE

05:09.866 --> 05:10.766
OLYMPICS.

05:10.833 --> 05:11.900
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

05:11.966 --> 05:14.533
WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE IT OR NOT."

05:14.600 --> 05:16.166
>> John: WOW.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.000
THAT IS A HARD PUSHBACK.

05:18.066 --> 05:19.333
AND THE R.O.C. WAS VERY MUCH NOT

05:19.400 --> 05:20.566
DONE, CALLING THE COMPLAINTS

05:20.633 --> 05:22.100
"ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PROPAGANDA,

05:22.166 --> 05:23.533
OOZING VERBAL SWEAT IN

05:23.600 --> 05:25.166
THE TOKYO HEAT."

05:25.233 --> 05:27.000
WHICH IS UNDENIABLY POETIC.

05:27.066 --> 05:29.300
"OOZING VERBAL SWEAT IN THE

05:29.366 --> 05:31.566
TOKYO HEAT" SOUNDS LESS LIKE

05:31.633 --> 05:33.033
RUSSIAN TOUGH TALK AND MORE LIKE

05:33.100 --> 05:35.200
A LINE FROM "A STREETCAR NAMED

05:35.266 --> 05:38.600
DESIRE 2: BLANCHE GOES EAST."

05:38.666 --> 05:39.766
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT MAKING

05:39.833 --> 05:40.766
RUSSIA COMPETE UNDER A

05:40.833 --> 05:42.266
SUPPOSEDLY "NEUTRAL" FLAG AND

05:42.333 --> 05:44.633
UNIFORMS, WHEN NEITHER THE FLAG

05:44.700 --> 05:46.133
NOR THE UNIFORMS WERE NEUTRAL,

05:46.200 --> 05:47.566
MEANS THAT THIS PUNISHMENT

05:47.633 --> 05:48.566
WASN'T REALLY A PUNISHMENT AT

05:48.633 --> 05:49.766
ALL.

05:49.833 --> 05:50.933
SO LET'S TRY AND LEARN FROM

05:51.000 --> 05:52.600
THIS, AND NEXT TIME THIS PROBLEM

05:52.666 --> 05:54.333
ARISES, LET'S MAKE SURE BANNED

05:54.400 --> 05:56.100
COUNTRIES HAVE A MUCH CLEARER

05:56.166 --> 05:58.100
ASTERISK ON THEIR PARTICIPATION.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.366
SO INSTEAD OF A OBVIOUSLY

06:00.433 --> 06:02.266
FLAG-THEMED TRACKSUIT, LET'S

06:02.333 --> 06:03.933
PUT THEM IN A SHREK-THEMED

06:04.000 --> 06:05.333
SWEATSHIRT PAIRED WITH

06:05.400 --> 06:06.533
SHIT EMOJI SLIPPERS AND A

06:06.600 --> 06:08.433
LOBSTER HAT.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.533
SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

06:09.600 --> 06:10.433
SEE?

06:10.500 --> 06:12.000
NOW THAT IS A NEUTRAL LOOK.

06:12.066 --> 06:13.033
GOOD LUCK GUESSING WHAT NATION

06:13.100 --> 06:14.533
THAT ATHLETE IS COMPETING FOR

06:14.600 --> 06:16.533
FROM THAT OUTFIT.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.666
AND WHEN THEIR ATHLETES WIN

06:17.733 --> 06:19.500
GOLD, DON'T GIVE THEM SOMETHING

06:19.566 --> 06:21.066
THAT INSPIRES NATIONAL PRIDE

06:21.133 --> 06:22.666
LIKE TCHAIKOVSKY.

06:22.733 --> 06:24.100
INSTEAD, PLAY SOMETHING AWFUL

06:24.166 --> 06:25.566
THAT'S GUARANTEED TO STICK IN

>> IT IS MONDAY.

07:15.366 --> 07:15.666
>> HOLLA!

07:15.733 --> 07:16.266
HELLO.

07:16.333 --> 07:19.566
HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND?

07:19.633 --> 07:20.866
>> BUSY BUT GOOD.

07:20.933 --> 07:22.633
>> HOW ARE YOU?

07:22.700 --> 07:24.033
>> I AM GOOD.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.033
YOURSELF?

07:25.100 --> 07:26.700
>> DOING GOOD.

07:26.766 --> 07:28.433
HOW ARE YOU?

07:28.500 --> 07:29.566
>> GOOD.

07:29.633 --> 07:29.833
CHILLING.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.100
ANOTHER DAY.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.233
>> WHAT IS UP?

07:32.300 --> 07:35.233
HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED HOW SMART

07:35.300 --> 07:37.066
YOUR DOG IS?

07:37.133 --> 07:37.933
>> YEAH.

07:38.000 --> 07:38.733
>> AIRING MOVIES YOU CAN'T

07:38.800 --> 07:40.900
NECESSARILY SEE AT THE THEATERS.

07:40.966 --> 07:42.566
WE ARE READY, WE ARE IN THIS

07:42.633 --> 07:44.300
SPIRIT.

07:44.366 --> 07:44.833
>> YEP.

07:44.900 --> 07:45.400
WE ARE.

07:45.466 --> 07:47.233
>> THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE

07:47.300 --> 07:49.933
SHOWS WE DO EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.366
>> I THINK IT'S...

07:51.433 --> 07:52.566
FUN.

07:52.633 --> 07:53.100
>> DOING GOOD.

07:53.166 --> 07:55.200
DOING REAL GOOD.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.733
>> ALL RIGHTS.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.133
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.366
>> GOOD.

08:00.433 --> 08:01.666
>> NOT A LOT OF CHANGE FROM

08:01.733 --> 08:01.933
YESTERDAY.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.566
IT'S GOOD MORNING.

08:06.633 --> 08:07.900
>> HOW WAS THE DAY?

08:07.966 --> 08:08.100
GOOD?

08:08.166 --> 08:10.666
>> AGAIN, GOOD.

08:10.733 --> 08:11.566
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:11.633 --> 08:12.200
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:12.266 --> 08:12.833
A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT'S

08:12.900 --> 08:13.900
EXPOSED THE FAILURE OF AMERICAN

08:13.966 --> 08:14.533
INSTITUTIONS.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.266
NO, NOT THAT ONE.

08:15.333 --> 08:15.966
NOT THAT ONE EITHER.

08:16.033 --> 08:16.533
THAT'S A GOOD POINT, BUT NOT

08:16.600 --> 08:18.433
ACTUALLY THIS TIME.

08:18.500 --> 08:19.400
YEP, THERE IT IS.

08:19.466 --> 08:19.900
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

08:19.966 --> 08:20.600
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "HOLD

08:20.666 --> 08:21.333
ON, DIDN'T YOU ALREADY DO A SHOW

08:21.400 --> 08:22.166
ABOUT THIS?"

08:22.233 --> 08:23.600
YOU'RE WRONG.

08:23.666 --> 08:24.933
WE'VE ACTUALLY DONE TWO OF THEM,

08:25.000 --> 08:25.833
BUT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WORTH

08:25.900 --> 08:26.833
DOING A THIRD INSTALLMENT

08:26.900 --> 08:29.366
TONIGHT FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.

08:29.433 --> 08:30.766
FIRST, IT'S AN EPIDEMIC THAT'S

08:30.833 --> 08:32.633
STILL VERY MUCH RAGING,

08:32.700 --> 08:34.733
EXACERBATED BY BOTH THE PANDEMIC

08:34.800 --> 08:36.766
AND ILLICIT FENTANYL, TO THE

08:36.833 --> 08:38.266
POINT THAT LAST YEAR, NEARLY

08:38.333 --> 08:39.866
70,000 PEOPLE DIED FROM OPIOID

08:39.933 --> 08:44.000
OVERDOSES.

08:44.066 --> 08:44.733
THAT IS THE HIGHEST ANNUAL DEATH

08:44.800 --> 08:45.766
TOLL EVER.

08:45.833 --> 08:46.533
AND SECOND, YOU MAY HAVE SEEN A

08:46.600 --> 08:47.500
BUNCH OF HEADLINES RECENTLY

08:47.566 --> 08:48.400
ABOUT TRIALS AND SETTLEMENTS

08:48.466 --> 08:49.500
TAKING PLACE AROUND THE COUNTRY.

08:49.566 --> 08:53.266
THERE'VE BEEN SO MANY, IT CAN BE

08:53.333 --> 08:54.500
GENUINELY BE HARD TO KEEP TRACK.

08:54.566 --> 08:56.600
BUT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST ONE

08:56.666 --> 08:58.400
COMPANY TONIGHT: PURDUE PHARMA,

08:58.466 --> 08:59.966
WHOSE ROLLOUT OF OXYCONTIN

09:00.033 --> 09:01.133
ARGUABLY FUELED THE OPIOID

09:01.200 --> 09:02.333
CRISIS.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.933
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THEIR

09:04.000 --> 09:05.100
RELENTLESS PUSH TO SELL

09:05.166 --> 09:06.400
OXYCONTIN BEFORE, BUT MORE

09:06.466 --> 09:07.500
MATERIAL HAS COME OUT IN THE

09:07.566 --> 09:09.066
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS --

09:09.133 --> 09:10.533
INCLUDING THIS SPECTACULAR

09:10.600 --> 09:11.900
GLIMPSE INTO A 1997 MOTIVATIONAL

09:11.966 --> 09:12.966
SALES MEETING FOR THE COMPANY'S

09:13.033 --> 09:14.966
DRUG REPS:

09:15.033 --> 09:15.733

09:40.966 --> 09:42.100
THAT WAS PURDUE'S VP OF SALES

09:42.166 --> 09:43.933
PERFORMING AN OXY-THEMED COVER

09:44.000 --> 09:45.100
OF "SHOUT!"

09:45.166 --> 09:46.466
AND THAT HAS GOT TO BE THE ONE

09:46.533 --> 09:47.633
OF THE MOST UPSETTING DECISIONS

09:47.700 --> 09:49.300
FROM THE LATE '90s, RIGHT UP

09:49.366 --> 09:50.300
THERE WITH, "GIVE EVERY LONELY

09:50.366 --> 09:51.933
CHILD AN ELECTRONIC IMAGINARY

09:52.000 --> 09:53.600
FRIEND THAT WILL IMMEDIATELY

09:53.666 --> 09:54.733
DIE," AND "LET'S SET EVERY

09:54.800 --> 09:55.866
SITCOM IN NEW YORK CITY.

09:55.933 --> 09:57.166
AND MAKE SURE THE TWIN TOWERS

09:57.233 --> 09:58.833
ARE PROMINENTLY FEATURED IN THE

09:58.900 --> 10:00.366
TRANSITION SHOTS, REALLY REMIND

10:00.433 --> 10:03.100
PEOPLE THEY'RE THERE."

10:03.166 --> 10:05.166
PURDUE PHARMA IS OWNED BY THE

10:05.233 --> 10:06.166
SACKLER FAMILY, AND IN RECENT

10:06.233 --> 10:07.400
YEARS, PURDUE AND THE SACKLERS

10:07.466 --> 10:08.900
HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES BEING

10:08.966 --> 10:10.200
INVESTIGATED BY THE DOJ AND

10:10.266 --> 10:12.400
FACING THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS

10:12.466 --> 10:14.033
FILED BY STATE AND LOCAL

10:14.100 --> 10:15.033
GOVERNMENTS, NATIVE AMERICAN

10:15.100 --> 10:16.500
TRIBES, HOSPITALS, AND

10:16.566 --> 10:17.600
INDIVIDUALS.

10:17.666 --> 10:18.733
AND THEY'VE SPENT YEARS WORKING

10:18.800 --> 10:20.066
WITH AN ARMY OF LAWYERS,

10:20.133 --> 10:21.900
ATTEMPTING TO NEGOTIATE THEIR

10:21.966 --> 10:23.200
WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT, WHICH HAS

10:23.266 --> 10:25.200
RESULTED IN TWO MAJOR

10:25.266 --> 10:26.266
RESOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THIS BIG

10:26.333 --> 10:28.366
NEWS FROM LAST OCTOBER.

10:28.433 --> 10:29.933
>> IT'S BEING HAILED BY THE

10:30.000 --> 10:31.600
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A MAJOR

10:31.666 --> 10:33.033
VICTORY AGAINST A COMPANY WHOSE

10:33.100 --> 10:34.800
DRUG OXYCONTIN IS PART OF THE

10:34.866 --> 10:36.033
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS OF OPIOID

10:36.100 --> 10:37.366
ADDICTION THAT HAS LED TO THE

10:37.433 --> 10:38.733
DEATHS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

10:38.800 --> 10:40.300
OF AMERICANS.

10:40.366 --> 10:42.366
>> THE MAKER OF OXYCONTIN

10:42.433 --> 10:43.700
ADMITTED TO DEFRAUDING

10:43.766 --> 10:44.800
REGULATORS AND PAYING ILLEGAL

10:44.866 --> 10:46.566
KICKBACKS TO DOCTORS.

10:46.633 --> 10:47.633
>> John: IT'S TRUE!

10:47.700 --> 10:48.800
PURDUE HAS PLED GUILTY TO

10:48.866 --> 10:51.366
MULTIPLE FELONIES.

10:51.433 --> 10:52.400
AND IT'S WEIRD TO HEAR NEWS THAT

10:52.466 --> 10:57.333
SOUNDS SO GENUINELY GOOD.

10:57.400 --> 10:58.733
IT'D BE REALLY NICE TO GET MORE

10:58.800 --> 11:00.200
OF THAT ONCE IN A WHILE, LIKE

11:00.266 --> 11:01.533
"NO ONCE-IN-A-CENTURY WEATHER

11:01.600 --> 11:02.866
EVENTS FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS,"

11:02.933 --> 11:04.233
OR "BILLIONAIRE GOES TO SPACE

11:04.300 --> 11:05.700
AND DIES THERE."

11:05.766 --> 11:06.866
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING

11:06.933 --> 11:07.500
HEARTWARMING.

11:07.566 --> 11:08.233
THAT GUILTY PLEA WAS ACTUALLY

11:08.300 --> 11:09.000
PART OF A MUCH LARGER PLAN WE'LL

11:09.066 --> 11:10.333
GET INTO LATER, INVOLVING THE

11:10.400 --> 11:11.033
COMPANY ALSO FILING FOR

11:11.100 --> 11:12.266
BANKRUPTCY, AND JUST THIS PAST

11:12.333 --> 11:13.166
MARCH, SUBMITTING A

11:13.233 --> 11:14.200
REORGANIZATION PLAN THAT WOULD

11:14.266 --> 11:15.633
END SACKLER OWNERSHIP.

11:15.700 --> 11:19.900
AND THE THING IS, THIS MIGHT ALL

11:19.966 --> 11:20.500
SOUND LIKE A MAJOR VICTORY --

11:20.566 --> 11:22.933
THAT THE SACKLERS ARE FINALLY

11:23.000 --> 11:24.500
EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT

11:24.566 --> 11:26.366
CONSEQUENCES -- BUT

11:26.433 --> 11:27.566
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT COULDN'T BE

11:27.633 --> 11:28.566
FARTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

11:28.633 --> 11:29.566
SO TONIGHT, WITH THE

11:29.633 --> 11:30.733
BANKRUPTCY'S CONFIRMATION

11:30.800 --> 11:32.500
HEARING SCHEDULED TO BEGIN LATER

11:32.566 --> 11:34.133
THIS WEEK, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

11:34.200 --> 11:35.433
SACKLER FAMILY -- HOW HARD

11:35.500 --> 11:36.600
THEY'VE BEEN FIGHTING TO DEFEND

11:36.666 --> 11:37.933
THEIR NAME, THE DETAILS OF THE

11:38.000 --> 11:39.166
DEAL THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO

11:39.233 --> 11:41.166
STRIKE, AND WHY THE WHOLE THING

11:41.233 --> 11:42.666
IS A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT.

11:42.733 --> 11:44.500
AND LET'S START WITH A BASIC

11:44.566 --> 11:47.466
QUESTION: WHO ARE THE SACKLERS?

11:47.533 --> 11:48.566
WELL, THE SACKLERS ARE THE

11:48.633 --> 11:51.100
DESCENDANTS OF THREE BROTHERS --

11:51.166 --> 11:53.000
ARTHUR, RAYMOND, AND MORTIMER --

11:53.066 --> 11:54.000
WHO IN 1952 BOUGHT THE COMPANY

11:54.066 --> 11:55.266
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BECOME

11:55.333 --> 11:56.833
PURDUE PHARMA.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.566
AND WHILE ARTHUR'S BRANCH OF THE

11:58.633 --> 11:59.833
FAMILY SOLD THEIR STAKE DECADES

11:59.900 --> 12:01.600
AGO, BEFORE OXYCONTIN WAS

12:01.666 --> 12:02.800
DEVELOPED, THE HEIRS OF RAYMOND

12:02.866 --> 12:04.933
AND MORTIMER BOTH BENEFITED

12:05.000 --> 12:07.066
FROM, AND IN SOME CASES ACTIVELY

12:07.133 --> 12:08.300
MANAGED, PURDUE'S BOOM YEARS OF

12:08.366 --> 12:10.733
SELLING OPIOIDS.

12:10.800 --> 12:15.400
MANY SACKLERS EITHER WORKED AT

12:15.466 --> 12:16.400
THE COMPANY OR SERVED ON ITS

12:16.466 --> 12:17.133
BOARD, AND AS THE MASSACHUSETTS

12:17.200 --> 12:18.100
A.G. POINTS OUT, SOME OF THEM

12:18.166 --> 12:20.933
WERE PRETTY HANDS-ON.

12:21.000 --> 12:21.900
>> THEY WERE IN THE BOARDROOM.

12:21.966 --> 12:23.166
THEY OWNED THE COMPANY.

12:23.233 --> 12:24.400
WE HAVE EMAILS AND MEMOS THAT

12:24.466 --> 12:26.100
SHOW THE DIRECT CONTROL THAT

12:26.166 --> 12:27.466
THEY EXERCISED OVER SALES AND

12:27.533 --> 12:29.466
MARKETING.

12:29.533 --> 12:31.066
ONE OF THE SACKLER FAMILY

12:31.133 --> 12:32.366
MEMBERS WENT SO FAR AS TO WANT

12:32.433 --> 12:34.400
TO GET IN THE CAR WITH PURDUE'S

12:34.466 --> 12:36.333
SALES REPS AND DRIVE AROUND TO

12:36.400 --> 12:44.300
VISIT DOCTORS' OFFICES.

12:44.366 --> 12:45.633
>> John: IT'S TRUE, AND DOING A

12:45.700 --> 12:46.766
DRUG REP RIDE-ALONG IS ABOUT AS

12:46.833 --> 12:47.900
HANDS-ON AS YOU CAN GET.

12:48.000 --> 12:48.500
AND QUICK SIDE NOTE, SPARE A

12:48.566 --> 12:49.500
THOUGHT FOR THE SALES REP IN

12:49.566 --> 12:49.866
QUESTION THERE.

12:49.933 --> 12:50.466
SURE, THEY TOO CONTRIBUTED TO

12:50.533 --> 12:51.333
THE OVER-PRESCRIPTION OF AMERICA

12:51.400 --> 12:52.100
AND PROBABLY LED TO THEIR OWN

12:52.166 --> 12:53.500
LOCAL MINI-EPIDEMIC, BUT

12:53.566 --> 12:55.200
NOBODY -- NOT EVEN HITLER --

12:55.266 --> 12:56.733
SHOULD HAVE TO SIT IN A CAR WITH

12:56.800 --> 12:57.766
THEIR BOSS.

12:57.833 --> 12:58.800
AND TALK ABOUT WHAT?

12:58.866 --> 13:00.900
THE WEATHER?

13:00.966 --> 13:01.700
AND THEN, WHEN YOU RUN OUT OF

13:01.766 --> 13:03.533
THINGS TO SAY ABOUT IT, DO WHAT?

13:03.600 --> 13:04.533
SIT IN SILENCE?

13:04.600 --> 13:05.633
AND THEN SAY, "ACTUALLY, I COULD

13:05.700 --> 13:06.600
GO FOR A BATHROOM BREAK RIGHT

13:06.666 --> 13:07.666
NOW," AND HAVE HIM SAY, "I'M

13:07.733 --> 13:09.533
FINE, BUT FEEL FREE TO STOP?"

13:09.600 --> 13:10.566
AND THEN, WHAT -- YOU STOP?

13:10.633 --> 13:12.166
AND HE WAITS IN THE CAR?

13:12.233 --> 13:13.333
AND THEN WHEN YOU GET BACK HE

13:13.400 --> 13:17.900
LOOKS INCONVENIENCED?

13:17.966 --> 13:19.333
I WOULD SOONER THROW MYSELF OUT

13:19.400 --> 13:19.966
OF THE CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

13:20.033 --> 13:20.533
FREEWAY.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.200
NOW, THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR

13:21.266 --> 13:22.166
THAT RIDE-ALONG WAS RICHARD

13:22.233 --> 13:23.100
SACKLER, WHO WAS ACTUALLY

13:23.166 --> 13:24.133
PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY FOR

13:24.200 --> 13:25.633
YEARS.

13:25.700 --> 13:26.566
AND YET, INTERESTINGLY, IT'S

13:26.633 --> 13:27.700
HARD TO FIND IMAGES OF HIM OTHER

13:27.766 --> 13:29.200
THAN THAT ONE.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.000
IN FACT, WHILE THE SACKLERS HAVE

13:31.066 --> 13:33.000
RELISHED SLAPPING THEIR FAMILY

13:33.066 --> 13:34.466
NAME ON INSTITUTIONS, AS

13:34.533 --> 13:35.500
INDIVIDUALS, THEY'VE TRIED TO

13:35.566 --> 13:37.833
STAY OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.133
WHEN RICHARD SACKLER GAVE A

13:39.200 --> 13:41.000
DEPOSITION IN 2015, PURDUE

13:41.066 --> 13:43.533
FOUGHT HARD TO KEEP IT PRIVATE.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.366
THAT'S WHY, IN OUR LAST PIECE,

13:45.433 --> 13:47.200
WE HAD A BUNCH OF ACTORS PLAY

13:47.266 --> 13:48.600
HIM TO CONVEY IMPORTANT THINGS

13:48.666 --> 13:50.000
LIKE THE FACT HE'D SAID "I DON'T

13:50.066 --> 13:52.466
KNOW" MORE THAN 100 TIMES.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.433
THANKFULLY, THAT DEPOSITION HAS

13:54.500 --> 13:55.200
SINCE BEEN RELEASED, SO YOU CAN

13:55.266 --> 13:58.300
FINALLY WATCH THE MAN IN ACTION.

13:58.366 --> 14:00.200
>> HOW MUCH MONEY HAS PURDUE

14:00.266 --> 14:01.200
FREDERICK OR PURDUE PHARMA MADE

14:01.266 --> 14:02.533
OFF THE SALE OF OXYCONTIN?

14:02.600 --> 14:04.333
>> I DON'T KNOW.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.233
I DON'T KNOW.

14:05.300 --> 14:06.633
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.

14:06.700 --> 14:11.500
I DON'T KNOW.

14:11.566 --> 14:12.200
I DON'T KNOW BUT -- I JUST DON'T

14:12.266 --> 14:13.466
KNOW.

14:13.533 --> 14:17.400
>> John: ADMIT IT --

14:17.466 --> 14:18.233
THE GUY JUST OOZES CHARISMA.

14:18.300 --> 14:18.666
ALTHOUGH HONESTLY?

14:18.733 --> 14:19.866
HAVING ACTUALLY SEEN IT, I THINK

14:19.933 --> 14:21.566
I PREFER THE VERSION WE MADE:

14:21.633 --> 14:22.766
>> HOW MUCH MONEY HAS PURDUE

14:22.833 --> 14:23.866
FREDERICK OR PURDUE PHARMA MADE

14:23.933 --> 14:25.600
OFF THE SALE OF OXYCONTIN?

14:25.666 --> 14:26.933
>> I DUNNO.

14:27.000 --> 14:27.700
I DUNNO.

14:27.766 --> 14:28.133
I DON'T KNOW.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.266
I DON'T KNOW.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.500
I DON'T KNOW.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.133
>> HOW MANY PURDUE ENTITIES ARE

14:32.200 --> 14:32.866
THERE?

14:32.933 --> 14:34.100
>> I DUNNO!

14:34.166 --> 14:35.566
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S JUST

14:35.633 --> 14:37.166
OBJECTIVELY BETTER.

14:37.233 --> 14:38.266
NOW, WHILE RICHARD WAS THE MOST

14:38.333 --> 14:40.833
INVOLVED, HE WASN'T ALONE.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.333
HIS COUSIN KATHE SACKLER WAS AN

14:42.400 --> 14:44.033
OFFICER OF THE COMPANY FOR YEARS

14:44.100 --> 14:45.400
AND EVEN CLAIMED IN EMAILS THAT

14:45.466 --> 14:46.633
DEVELOPING OXYCONTIN WAS HER

14:46.700 --> 14:50.133
IDEA.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.433
ALTHOUGH, DESPITE THAT, WHEN

14:51.500 --> 14:52.500
KATHE WAS CALLED BEFORE CONGRESS

14:52.566 --> 14:53.466
LAST YEAR AND ASKED TO APOLOGIZE

14:53.533 --> 14:54.600
FOR HER ROLE IN THE OPIOID

14:54.666 --> 14:55.500
CRISIS, SHE DIDN'T EXACTLY DO

14:55.566 --> 14:58.200
THAT.

14:58.266 --> 15:00.466
>> I HAVE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT,

15:00.533 --> 15:02.333
WAS -- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I

15:02.400 --> 15:04.733
COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY

15:04.800 --> 15:06.766
KNOWING WHAT I KNEW THEN, NOT

15:06.833 --> 15:09.933
WHAT I KNOW NOW.

15:10.000 --> 15:14.266
I HAVE TO SAY, I CAN'T -- THERE

15:14.333 --> 15:16.100
IS NOTHING THAT I CAN FIND THAT

15:16.166 --> 15:20.733
I WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.366
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, THAT'S NOT

15:21.433 --> 15:22.366
AN APOLOGY, KATHE.

15:22.433 --> 15:23.433
AND SECOND, COME ON -- NEARLY A

15:23.500 --> 15:24.766
YEAR INTO A PANDEMIC, THAT'S AN

15:24.833 --> 15:26.366
UNACCEPTABLE AT-HOME SETUP.

15:26.433 --> 15:27.566
PUT YOUR LAPTOP ON A COUPLE

15:27.633 --> 15:28.466
BOOKS.

15:28.533 --> 15:29.466
UPGRADE YOUR ROUTER.

15:29.533 --> 15:30.566
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,

15:30.633 --> 15:34.333
ONE-CLICK A RING LIGHT.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.000
SO, KATHE, THAT'S BOOKS, ROUTER,

15:35.066 --> 15:35.500
RING LIGHT.

15:35.566 --> 15:36.633
IT'S THE LITTLE ZOOM TRICKS

15:36.700 --> 15:37.300
WE'VE ALL LEARNED THAT'LL HELP

15:37.366 --> 15:38.166
YOU LOOK YOUR BEST AS YOU

15:38.233 --> 15:39.100
ABSOLVE YOURSELF OF

15:39.166 --> 15:40.000
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A MASSIVE

15:40.066 --> 15:41.800
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

15:41.866 --> 15:43.000
BUT THE SACKLERS HAVEN'T JUST

15:43.066 --> 15:44.333
BEEN APPEARING AT CONGRESSIONAL

15:44.400 --> 15:45.600
HEARINGS.

15:45.666 --> 15:47.033
SOME HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD TO

15:47.100 --> 15:50.533
REHABILITATE THEIR IMAGE AND

15:50.600 --> 15:51.600
EVEN PAINT THEMSELVES AS

15:51.666 --> 15:54.233
VICTIMS.

15:54.300 --> 15:57.600
TAKE DAVID SACKLER.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.000
HE'S RICHARD'S SON AND A FORMER

15:59.066 --> 15:59.466
BOARD MEMBER HIMSELF.

15:59.533 --> 16:00.266
HE GAVE AN INTERVIEW TO

16:00.333 --> 16:00.966
"VANITY FAIR" FEATURING THIS

16:01.033 --> 16:01.566
PORTRAIT, WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT

16:01.633 --> 16:02.233
SHOULD BE A POSTER FOR

16:02.300 --> 16:03.066
NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING IN A

16:03.133 --> 16:05.133
CHRISTIAN HEALTH CLINIC.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.900
AND IN IT, HE COMPLAINED,

16:06.966 --> 16:08.266
"MY FOUR-YEAR-OLD CAME HOME FROM

16:08.333 --> 16:10.266
NURSERY SCHOOL AND ASKED,

16:10.333 --> 16:11.533
'WHY ARE MY FRIENDS TELLING ME

16:11.600 --> 16:12.766
THAT OUR FAMILY'S WORK IS

16:12.833 --> 16:15.200
KILLING PEOPLE?'" WHICH DOESN'T

16:15.266 --> 16:16.900
SEEM REMOTELY CREDIBLE.

16:16.966 --> 16:18.333
FOR A START, EVERYONE KNOWS

16:18.400 --> 16:19.433
THAT'S NOT HOW FOUR-YEAR-OLDS

16:19.500 --> 16:20.866
TALK.

16:20.933 --> 16:23.633
YOU'RE MISSING 8 "UMS,"

16:23.700 --> 16:24.666
15 "AND, AND, ANDS," 3 TIMES

16:24.733 --> 16:25.900
THEY'RE COMPLETELY OUT OF BREATH

16:25.966 --> 16:26.466
FOR NO REASON, AND 5 COMPLETE

16:26.533 --> 16:27.800
TRAIL-OFFS.

16:27.866 --> 16:29.233
I CALL BULLSHIT ON THAT FAKE

16:29.300 --> 16:31.666
ANECDOTE.

16:31.733 --> 16:33.233
BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

16:33.300 --> 16:36.233
DAVID'S BRANCH OF THE FAMILY WAS

16:36.300 --> 16:37.333
ALSO INVOLVED IN THE LAUNCH OF A

16:37.400 --> 16:38.733
PRO-SACKLER WEBSITE THAT AIMS TO

16:38.800 --> 16:41.200
"CORRECT THE RECORD," CALLED

16:41.266 --> 16:42.333
JudgeForYourselves.info,

16:42.400 --> 16:43.000
WHICH IS SHOCKING FOR A NUMBER

16:43.066 --> 16:44.200
OF REASONS.

16:44.266 --> 16:45.600
FIRST, BECAUSE BILLIONAIRES, FOR

16:45.666 --> 16:46.433
SOME REASON, CHOSE NOT TO

16:46.500 --> 16:49.733
SPLURGE FOR THE DOT-COM, BUT

16:49.800 --> 16:50.366
ALSO BECAUSE OF JUST HOW PETTY

16:50.433 --> 16:52.066
THE WEBSITE IS.

16:52.133 --> 16:53.633
IT FEATURES A LIST OF OUTLETS

16:53.700 --> 16:55.766
THAT MISTAKENLY USED THE BRAND

16:55.833 --> 16:57.233
NAME "OXYCONTIN" WHEN THEY MEANT

16:57.300 --> 16:58.600
THE GENERIC "OXYCODONE,"

16:58.666 --> 17:01.333
INCLUDING A COLLEGE NEWSPAPER,

17:01.400 --> 17:02.600
AND OVER SEVEN HOURS OF VIDEO

17:02.666 --> 17:04.366
PRESENTATIONS IN WHICH A

17:04.433 --> 17:06.200
CATASTROPHICALLY UNCHARISMATIC

17:06.266 --> 17:07.600
LAWYER ATTEMPTS TO DISPROVE

17:07.666 --> 17:09.433
EVERY LEGAL ARGUMENT EVER MADE

17:09.500 --> 17:12.333
AGAINST THE SACKLERS AND PURDUE.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.566
THIS TERRIBLE WEBSITE OF

17:15.633 --> 17:17.000
SELF-SERVING NONSENSE HAS BEEN

17:17.066 --> 17:19.300
PROMOTED BY, AMONG OTHERS,

17:19.366 --> 17:20.766
JOSS SACKLER, DAVID'S WIFE, WHO

17:20.833 --> 17:21.566
YOU MAY REMEMBER FROM HER

17:21.633 --> 17:22.366
FAILURE TO FACE THE CAMERA IN

17:22.433 --> 17:25.400
"VANITY FAIR."

17:25.466 --> 17:30.566
NOW, EVEN THOUGH JOSS ISN'T

17:30.633 --> 17:33.400
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE FAMILY

17:33.466 --> 17:35.433
BUSINESS, SHE ACTUALLY TALKS

17:35.500 --> 17:35.966
PUBLICLY MORE THAN MOST

17:36.033 --> 17:36.733
SACKLERS.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.333
SHE HAS A CLOTHING LINE CALLED

17:37.400 --> 17:38.200
"LBV," OR "LES BOULEDOGUES

17:38.266 --> 17:38.800
VIGNERONNES," WHICH TRANSLATES

17:38.866 --> 17:39.866
TO "THE WINEMAKING BULLDOGS" AND

17:39.933 --> 17:40.333
IS AN OFFSHOOT OF HER

17:40.400 --> 17:40.933
"MEMBERS-ONLY WINE AND SOCIAL

17:41.000 --> 17:41.700
CLUB."

17:41.766 --> 17:43.633
JOSS WAS ALSO ONCE INTERVIEWED

17:43.700 --> 17:44.333
FOR "TOWN & COUNTRY," IN WHICH

17:44.400 --> 17:45.233
SHE COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW

17:45.300 --> 17:46.233
UNFAIRLY THE PRESS TREATS BOTH

17:46.300 --> 17:47.266
HER AND HER FAMILY, NOTING

17:47.333 --> 17:48.633
THAT A PREVIOUS ARTICLE

17:48.700 --> 17:50.533
WOULDN'T REFER TO HER AS

17:50.600 --> 17:52.300
DR. JOSS SACKLER, DESPITE HER

17:52.366 --> 17:53.900
TELLING THEM SHE HAD A Ph.D. IN

17:53.966 --> 17:56.266
LINGUISTICS, GOING ON TO SAY,

17:56.333 --> 17:59.133
"THEY'RE GOING TO REGRET FUCKING

17:59.200 --> 18:00.433
WITH A LINGUIST."

18:00.500 --> 18:01.166
AND THAT'S ONE HELL OF A CLAIM,

18:01.233 --> 18:02.400
JOSS.

18:02.466 --> 18:03.933
BECAUSE NOBODY IS INTIMIDATED BY

18:04.000 --> 18:05.500
LINGUISTS.

18:05.566 --> 18:06.466
YOU'RE BASICALLY AN ENGLISH

18:06.533 --> 18:08.900
MAJOR WHO WASTED MORE TIME.

18:08.966 --> 18:09.700
I'LL FUCK WITH A LINGUIST ALL

18:09.766 --> 18:10.566
DAY LONG.

18:10.633 --> 18:12.066
I'LL SHOW YOU: HOW DO YOU MAKE

18:12.133 --> 18:13.500
TWO PROPER NOUNS INTO A DOUBLE

18:13.566 --> 18:13.966
NEGATIVE?

18:14.033 --> 18:15.666
JOSS AND DAVID.

18:15.733 --> 18:16.666
BOOM!

18:16.733 --> 18:19.533
LINGUIST, FUCKED WITH.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.700
SO TO RECAP, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR:

18:20.766 --> 18:22.133
SOME SACKLERS HAVE BEEN WORKING

18:22.200 --> 18:24.300
EXTREMELY HARD TO TRY AND

18:24.366 --> 18:25.700
ENGENDER PUBLIC SYMPATHY.

18:25.766 --> 18:26.700
BUT THE REAL BATTLE THE FAMILY'S

18:26.766 --> 18:27.800
BEEN FIGHTING HAS BEEN A LEGAL

18:27.866 --> 18:29.433
ONE.

18:29.500 --> 18:30.500
AND THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO SPEND

18:30.566 --> 18:31.666
THE REST OF THIS PIECE TALKING

18:31.733 --> 18:32.533
ABOUT, BECAUSE WHILE THE DETAILS

18:32.600 --> 18:34.433
OF WHAT THE SACKLERS ARE DOING

18:34.500 --> 18:36.133
ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED, THE

18:36.200 --> 18:38.300
END RESULT IS BOTH SIMPLE AND

18:38.366 --> 18:41.700
ABSOLUTELY INFURIATING.

18:41.766 --> 18:44.066
AND LET'S START WITH THAT DEAL

18:44.133 --> 18:45.600
YOU HEARD ABOUT EARLIER, WHERE

18:45.666 --> 18:47.000
PURDUE PLED GUILTY TO THREE

18:47.066 --> 18:48.466
FELONIES.

18:48.533 --> 18:50.266
IT SOUNDED LIKE SOME GOOD NEWS.

18:50.333 --> 18:51.566
BUT THERE ARE SOME MAJOR

18:51.633 --> 18:52.866
ASTERISKS THERE, BECAUSE WHILE

18:52.933 --> 18:54.366
THE COMPANY PLED GUILTY TO THOSE

18:54.433 --> 18:56.100
CHARGES, NO INDIVIDUALS DID --

18:56.166 --> 18:58.000
AND CERTAINLY NO SACKLERS.

18:58.066 --> 19:00.266
AND THAT ALONE IS A BIG DEAL TO

19:00.333 --> 19:01.966
THEM.

19:02.033 --> 19:03.566
IN FACT, JUST WATCH AS KATHE

19:03.633 --> 19:05.033
JUMPED TO REMIND EVERYONE OF

19:05.100 --> 19:06.600
THAT FACT DURING HER

19:06.666 --> 19:08.100
CONGRESSIONAL HEARING.

19:08.166 --> 19:10.133
>> THE SACKLER FAMILY, THROUGH

19:10.200 --> 19:11.566
PURDUE, HAS THREE FELONY

19:11.633 --> 19:13.366
CONVICTIONS, BUT NO ONE'S IN

19:13.433 --> 19:14.166
JAIL AND IT HAS ITS BILLIONS

19:14.233 --> 19:15.366
STILL.

19:15.433 --> 19:16.600
>> EXCUSE ME, THE SACKLER FAMILY

19:16.666 --> 19:18.233
DOESN'T HAVE A FELONY

19:18.300 --> 19:19.766
CONVICTION.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.000
PURDUE PHARMA HAS A FELONY

19:21.066 --> 19:22.766
CONVICTION.

19:22.833 --> 19:28.466
I'M AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON.

19:28.533 --> 19:32.333
>> John: OKAY, HOLD ON.

19:32.400 --> 19:32.966
I DO GET THE POINT SHE'S MAKING,

19:33.033 --> 19:33.600
BUT THE FACT IS, PURDUE IS MADE

19:33.666 --> 19:34.433
UP OF INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE WHO

19:34.500 --> 19:34.800
CONTROL IT.

19:34.866 --> 19:35.966
THINK OF PURDUE LIKE LAMBCHOP.

19:36.033 --> 19:36.833
IF LAMBCHOP THREATENED TO KILL

19:36.900 --> 19:38.433
THE PRESIDENT ON LIVE TV,

19:38.500 --> 19:39.666
LAMBCHOP WOULDN'T GET IN TROUBLE

19:39.733 --> 19:40.766
OR GO TO PRISON.

19:40.833 --> 19:41.833
SHARI LEWIS WOULD.

19:41.900 --> 19:42.633
WHY?

19:42.700 --> 19:46.700
BECAUSE LAMBCHOP IS A PUPPET

19:46.766 --> 19:47.533
WHO DOES WHATEVER THE FUCK

19:47.600 --> 19:48.333
SHARI LEWIS TELLS LAMBCHOP

19:48.400 --> 19:48.733
TO DO.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.000
NOW, THE SACKLERS MIGHT ARGUE

19:50.066 --> 19:50.733
THAT PURDUE WAS CONTROLLED BY

19:50.800 --> 19:52.166
MANY PEOPLE -- INCLUDING

19:52.233 --> 19:53.433
NON-FAMILY MEMBERS -- AND THAT

19:53.500 --> 19:54.233
WHILE THEY'RE NOT FACING

19:54.300 --> 19:55.933
CRIMINAL CHARGES, THEY'RE STILL

19:56.000 --> 19:56.966
FACING CONSEQUENCES.

19:57.033 --> 19:59.000
BUT HERE'S THE THING: ARE THEY?

19:59.066 --> 20:02.066
REALLY?

20:02.133 --> 20:04.166
AND THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE

20:04.233 --> 20:06.066
BANKRUPTCY I MENTIONED EARLIER.

20:06.133 --> 20:07.600
BECAUSE THE BANKRUPTCY DEAL

20:07.666 --> 20:08.566
PURDUE HAS PROPOSED IS THE

20:08.633 --> 20:09.533
VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH THE

20:09.600 --> 20:10.700
SACKLERS ARE LIKELY TO ESCAPE

20:10.766 --> 20:14.733
ANY TRUE ACCOUNTABILITY.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.500
VERY BASICALLY, PURDUE WAS

20:15.566 --> 20:17.133
BURIED IN THOUSANDS OF LAWSUITS,

20:17.200 --> 20:18.200
AND RATHER THAN FIGHTING THEM

20:18.266 --> 20:19.600
ALL SEPARATELY, THE COMPANY

20:19.666 --> 20:21.400
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY,

20:21.466 --> 20:22.000
NEGOTIATING TO RESOLVE ALL ITS

20:22.066 --> 20:23.666
DEBTS IN ONE PLACE.

20:23.733 --> 20:25.300
THIS PROPOSED DEAL REQUIRES,

20:25.366 --> 20:26.866
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SACKLERS

20:26.933 --> 20:28.766
RELINQUISH OWNERSHIP OF PURDUE,

20:28.833 --> 20:29.600
WHICH WILL BE TURNED INTO A

20:29.666 --> 20:30.733
"PUBLIC BENEFIT COMPANY," WHOSE

20:30.800 --> 20:31.866
PROFITS WILL GO TOWARD FIGHTING

20:31.933 --> 20:33.333
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.933
NOW, THE COMPANY CLAIMS THE

20:35.033 --> 20:35.800
BANKRUPTCY WILL DELIVER MORE

20:35.866 --> 20:38.700
THAN $10 BILLION IN VALUE.

20:38.766 --> 20:43.233
BUT A FEW THINGS ABOUT THAT.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.566
FIRST, THE SACKLERS THEMSELVES

20:44.633 --> 20:45.700
ARE ONLY CONTRIBUTING AROUND

20:45.766 --> 20:47.533
$4.3 BILLION TO THAT SETTLEMENT.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.566
WHICH DOES SOUND LIKE A LOT

20:49.633 --> 20:50.900
UNTIL YOU LEARN THE FAMILY HAS

20:50.966 --> 20:52.800
ASSETS OF AROUND $11 BILLION,

20:52.866 --> 20:54.800
WHICH IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF

20:54.866 --> 20:56.666
MONEY, BUT I GUESS THAT'S WHAT

20:56.733 --> 20:58.766
HAPPENS WHEN YOUR COMPANY MAKES

20:58.833 --> 21:00.533
A HIGHLY ADDICTIVE PRODUCT AND

21:00.600 --> 21:01.566
PUSHES ITS EMPLOYEES TO --

21:01.633 --> 21:02.333
>> ♪ SELL OXYCONTIN! ♪

21:02.400 --> 21:03.500
♪ MS CONTIN! ♪

21:03.566 --> 21:14.333
♪ SELL! ♪

21:14.400 --> 21:15.433
>> John: I JUST SAW THAT TEN

21:15.500 --> 21:16.600
MINUTES AGO AND SOMEHOW IT'S

21:16.666 --> 21:17.233
GOTTEN EVEN WORSE.

21:17.300 --> 21:21.200
ALSO, YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW, A

21:21.266 --> 21:22.133
LOT OF THE SACKLER FAMILY'S NET

21:22.200 --> 21:22.800
WORTH WAS BUILT UP IN A

21:22.866 --> 21:23.966
PARTICULAR PERIOD.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.766
BECAUSE FROM 2008 TO 2017, EVEN

21:25.833 --> 21:28.600
AS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC WAS

21:28.666 --> 21:31.000
KICKING INTO HIGH GEAR, MORE

21:31.066 --> 21:33.066
THAN $10 BILLION WAS TRANSFERRED

21:33.133 --> 21:34.866
OUT OF THE COMPANY FOR THE

21:34.933 --> 21:35.966
BENEFIT OF THE FAMILY.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.633
NOW, THE SACKLERS FIERCELY

21:37.700 --> 21:39.000
MAINTAIN THOSE TRANSFERS WERE

21:39.066 --> 21:40.333
PROPER.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.633
BUT THE DOJ ALLEGED THAT THEY

21:41.700 --> 21:42.800
WERE MADE TO HINDER FUTURE

21:42.866 --> 21:43.866
CREDITORS -- IN OTHER WORDS, TO

21:43.933 --> 21:46.933
GET THE MONEY OUT OF THE

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
COMPANY SO THE SACKLERS COULD

21:48.066 --> 21:51.633
PROTECT IT -- AND THEY FOUND

21:51.700 --> 21:53.233
SOME PRETTY DAMNING EVIDENCE,

21:53.300 --> 21:54.600
PARTICULARLY FROM DAVID SACKLER,

21:54.666 --> 22:00.166
WHO SEEMED TO DIRECTLY EXPRESS

22:00.233 --> 22:00.900
FEARS OVER LAWSUITS TAKING THE

22:00.966 --> 22:01.533
FAMILY MONEY BACK IN 2007,

22:01.600 --> 22:02.300
WRITING IN AN EMAIL,

22:02.366 --> 22:03.266
"WE'RE RICH?

22:03.333 --> 22:05.000
FOR HOW LONG?

22:05.066 --> 22:07.133
UNTIL WHICH SUITS GET THROUGH TO

22:07.200 --> 22:08.166
THE FAMILY?"

22:08.233 --> 22:08.766
AND DAVID, BUDDY, DON'T SEND

22:08.833 --> 22:10.133
THAT KIND OF THING OVER EMAIL.

22:10.200 --> 22:10.700
I MEAN, DON'T SEND IT IN THE

22:10.766 --> 22:11.866
MAIL-MAIL, DON'T SPEAK IT, DON'T

22:11.933 --> 22:13.233
THINK IT, DON'T RECEIVE AN

22:13.300 --> 22:15.066
UPBRINGING THAT WOULD PLANT THE

22:15.133 --> 22:16.766
THOUGHT IN YOUR MIND, AND, IF

22:16.833 --> 22:17.433
YOU COULD, JUST TRY AND AVOID

22:17.500 --> 22:18.333
CONCEPTION ALTOGETHER.

22:18.400 --> 22:19.300
BUT BARE MINIMUM, KEEP IT OUT OF

22:19.366 --> 22:21.633
THE PERMANENT LEGAL RECORD.

22:21.700 --> 22:22.533
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "OKAY,

22:22.600 --> 22:23.500
SO, THEY TRANSFERRED MONEY TO

22:23.566 --> 22:24.200
THE FAMILY.

22:24.266 --> 22:24.866
BUT PEOPLE CAN STILL PURSUE

22:24.933 --> 22:26.100
CLAIMS AGAINST THE SACKLERS

22:26.166 --> 22:27.133
DIRECTLY, RIGHT?"

22:27.200 --> 22:28.666
WELL, NO.

22:28.733 --> 22:30.366
BECAUSE HERE'S THE REALLY

22:30.433 --> 22:32.233
INSIDIOUS PART: WHILE THERE ARE

22:32.300 --> 22:34.800
APPROXIMATELY 400 CIVIL SUITS

22:34.866 --> 22:38.033
THAT DO NAME THE SACKLERS

22:38.100 --> 22:39.100
THEMSELVES, THE FAMILY IS

22:39.166 --> 22:40.233
INSISTING THAT THEY WILL ONLY

22:40.300 --> 22:41.200
AGREE TO THIS SETTLEMENT IF THEY

22:41.266 --> 22:42.633
GET WHAT'S CALLED A

22:42.700 --> 22:43.700
NON-CONSENSUAL THIRD-PARTY

22:43.766 --> 22:45.500
RELEASE.

22:45.566 --> 22:47.700
AND THIS THING IS BULLSHIT.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.100
BECAUSE IF THEY GET IT, ALL

22:49.166 --> 22:50.100
CURRENT LAWSUITS AGAINST THE

22:50.166 --> 22:51.500
SACKLERS EVAPORATE AND NO FUTURE

22:51.566 --> 22:54.100
LAWSUITS CAN BE FILED.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.766
MEANING THE SACKLERS --

22:55.833 --> 22:57.333
WHO DIDN'T FILE FOR PERSONAL

22:57.400 --> 22:58.533
BANKRUPTCY THEMSELVES,

22:58.600 --> 23:00.000
REMEMBER -- ARE BASICALLY OFF

23:00.066 --> 23:00.733
THE HOOK.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.133
AND IF IT SOUNDS WEIRD TO YOU

23:02.200 --> 23:04.300
THAT A COMPANY CAN DECLARE

23:04.366 --> 23:06.100
BANKRUPTCY AND THEN A BUNCH OF

23:06.166 --> 23:08.200
INDIVIDUALS GET SHIELDED FROM

23:08.266 --> 23:10.033
LIABILITY, THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS!

23:10.100 --> 23:13.000
IT'S REALLY FUCKING WEIRD!

23:13.066 --> 23:14.066
IN FACT, SOME BANKRUPTCY COURTS

23:14.133 --> 23:15.533
DON'T ALLOW THESE THIRD-PARTY

23:15.600 --> 23:16.933
RELEASES AT ALL.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.733
BUT PURDUE VERY CAREFULLY CHOSE

23:18.800 --> 23:20.233
ONE THAT THEY KNEW PROBABLY

23:20.300 --> 23:21.800
WOULD.

23:21.866 --> 23:22.866
A FEW MONTHS BEFORE FILING FOR

23:22.933 --> 23:24.200
BANKRUPTCY, PURDUE CHANGED ONE

23:24.266 --> 23:25.766
OF ITS OFFICIAL CORPORATE

23:25.833 --> 23:26.966
ADDRESSES TO ONE IN WHITE

23:27.033 --> 23:28.800
PLAINS, NEW YORK, AT WHICH IT'S

23:28.866 --> 23:30.400
NEVER CONDUCTED BUSINESS, AND

23:30.466 --> 23:32.600
WHERE THERE IS ONLY ONE

23:32.666 --> 23:34.266
BANKRUPTCY JUDGE, WHO --

23:34.333 --> 23:36.066
COMPLETELY COINCIDENTALLY -- HAS

23:36.133 --> 23:37.766
SUPPORTED THIRD-PARTY RELEASES

23:37.833 --> 23:39.033
IN THE PAST.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.766
WHICH IS ALL A PRETTY OBVIOUS

23:40.833 --> 23:42.166
TACTIC.

23:42.233 --> 23:43.133
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY MOVED TO

23:43.200 --> 23:44.100
WHITE PLAINS FOR ANY OTHER

23:44.166 --> 23:45.400
REASON.

23:45.466 --> 23:46.766
IF YOU LOOK UP "THINGS TO DO IN

23:46.833 --> 23:49.133
WHITE PLAINS" -- AND THIS IS

23:49.200 --> 23:50.100
TRUE -- THE FIRST RESULT YOU GET

23:50.166 --> 23:51.166
IS A TRIPADVISOR PAGE

23:51.233 --> 23:52.566
RECOMMENDING A HELICOPTER TOUR

23:52.633 --> 23:58.366
OF NEW YORK CITY.

23:58.433 --> 23:59.166
WHICH IS JUST INCREDIBLE.

23:59.233 --> 24:00.000
"COME VISIT WHITE PLAINS, WHERE

24:00.066 --> 24:00.666
YOU CAN IMMEDIATELY LEAVE AND GO

24:00.733 --> 24:03.266
LOOK AT SOMEWHERE MORE

24:03.333 --> 24:03.833
INTERESTING TO LIVE."

24:03.900 --> 24:05.000
AND THE SACKLERS' THIRD-PARTY

24:05.066 --> 24:05.700
RELEASE IS COMPREHENSIVE,

24:05.766 --> 24:07.066
STATING THAT THE RELEASED

24:07.133 --> 24:08.700
PARTIES SHALL BE CONCLUSIVELY,

24:08.766 --> 24:10.266
ABSOLUTELY, UNCONDITIONALLY,

24:10.333 --> 24:11.300
IRREVOCABLY, FULLY, FINALLY,

24:11.366 --> 24:12.533
FOREVER, AND PERMANENTLY

24:12.600 --> 24:13.600
RELEASED FROM ANY AND ALL

24:13.666 --> 24:14.666
CLAIMS, OF ANY KIND, FROM THE

24:14.733 --> 24:17.600
BEGINNING OF TIME.

24:17.666 --> 24:21.000
AND THIS IS THE LIST OF EVERY

24:21.066 --> 24:21.800
PERSON AND ENTITY THEY WANT

24:21.866 --> 24:22.733
COVERED.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.000
IT CONTAINS OVER 200 COMPANIES

24:24.066 --> 24:25.166
AND 200 MORE TRUSTS WHERE THE

24:25.233 --> 24:26.233
SACKLERS HAVE TUCKED THEIR MONEY

24:26.300 --> 24:28.600
AWAY.

24:28.666 --> 24:30.000
THIS RELEASE IS LUDICROUSLY

24:30.066 --> 24:30.933
BROAD, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY

24:31.000 --> 24:32.100
NINE STATE A.G.s ARE STILL

24:32.166 --> 24:33.066
OBJECTING TO IT, AND TWO

24:33.133 --> 24:35.000
BRANCHES OF THE DOJ HAVE SAID IT

24:35.066 --> 24:37.866
VIOLATES THE U.S. CONSTITUTION

24:37.933 --> 24:40.500
AND SPECIFICALLY VIOLATES DUE

24:40.566 --> 24:47.666
PROCESS, BECAUSE IT DENIES

24:47.733 --> 24:49.433
INDIVIDUALS OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO

24:49.500 --> 24:50.166
BE HEARD, AND YET, INCREDIBLY,

24:50.233 --> 24:51.100
DESPITE ALL THIS, IT'S WIDELY

24:51.166 --> 24:52.066
ASSUMED THAT THIS WHOLE DEAL IS

24:52.133 --> 24:53.100
GOING TO GO AHEAD.

24:53.166 --> 24:56.033
AND WHILE IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE TO

24:56.100 --> 24:59.166
ME, I WILL SAY, AT LEAST ONE

24:59.233 --> 25:00.133
PERSON THINKS THAT'S A VERY GOOD

25:00.200 --> 25:03.833
THING.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.533
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THAT ONE

25:05.600 --> 25:06.066
PERSON IS PURDUE'S CURRENT

25:06.133 --> 25:06.733
CHAIRMAN.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.600
>> THIS IS A MILESTONE IN PUBLIC

25:07.666 --> 25:08.533
HEALTH HISTORY.

25:08.600 --> 25:09.533
NEVER BEFORE HAVE YOU SEEN THIS

25:09.600 --> 25:11.000
AMOUNT OF MONEY, $10 BILLION

25:11.066 --> 25:13.300
BEING DEVOTED TO OPIOID

25:13.366 --> 25:16.300
ABATEMENT, AND IT'S ONLY

25:16.366 --> 25:18.066
AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS PLAN,

25:18.133 --> 25:20.166
ASSUMING WE CAN GET IT APPROVED.

25:20.233 --> 25:21.866
AND I THINK WHEN PEOPLE THINK

25:21.933 --> 25:23.166
ABOUT IT, THEY WILL COME AROUND

25:23.233 --> 25:24.333
TO THE NOTION, "WELL, I MIGHT

25:24.400 --> 25:25.866
HAVE LIKED SOMETHING SLIGHTLY

25:25.933 --> 25:27.533
DIFFERENT, BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY

25:27.600 --> 25:30.200
A LOT BETTER THAN GOING INTO

25:30.266 --> 25:31.866
ENDLESS, COSTLY LITIGATION THAT

25:31.933 --> 25:33.700
MAY END UP WITH NO PROCEEDS

25:33.766 --> 25:34.733
GOING TO ANYBODY."

25:34.800 --> 25:36.166
>> John: OKAY, NO.

25:36.233 --> 25:37.300
"I MIGHT HAVE LIKED SOMETHING

25:37.366 --> 25:38.766
DIFFERENT, BUT THIS IS BETTER

25:38.833 --> 25:40.633
THAN NOTHING" IS WHAT YOU SAY

25:40.700 --> 25:42.200
WHEN YOUR DAD INSISTS ON HAVING

25:42.266 --> 25:43.233
DINNER AT CHILI'S, NOT WHEN

25:43.300 --> 25:44.200
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FATE OF

25:44.266 --> 25:45.166
A COMPANY THAT POISONED A

25:45.233 --> 25:46.633
GENERATION.

25:46.700 --> 25:47.466
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, IS, I

25:47.533 --> 25:50.766
BELIEVE, CHILI'S CURRENT SLOGAN.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.633
AND HERE'S THE THING: THAT MAN'S

25:52.700 --> 25:54.766
NOT EVEN ENTIRELY WRONG.

25:54.833 --> 25:56.866
THE LONGER THESE LAWSUITS DRAG

25:56.933 --> 25:58.166
ON, THE MORE MONEY WILL GET

25:58.233 --> 25:59.433
WASTED IN COURT, AND AN

25:59.500 --> 26:00.733
INCREASINGLY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF

26:00.800 --> 26:01.500
IT WILL GO TO LAWYERS RATHER

26:01.566 --> 26:02.766
THAN VICTIMS.

26:02.833 --> 26:03.833
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, UNDER THIS

26:03.900 --> 26:05.733
SETTLEMENT, CLAIMANTS COULD

26:05.800 --> 26:07.100
RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM $3,500 TO

26:07.166 --> 26:09.533
$48,000.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.033
WHICH, YES, FEELS WILDLY

26:11.100 --> 26:12.500
INSUFFICIENT.

26:12.566 --> 26:13.433
BUT SOME FAMILIES ARE

26:13.500 --> 26:16.166
RELUCTANTLY WILLING TO TAKE WHAT

26:16.233 --> 26:17.200
THEY CAN GET.

26:17.266 --> 26:18.366
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY OTHERS, LIKE

26:18.433 --> 26:19.366
THIS WOMAN -- WHOSE SON BECAME

26:19.433 --> 26:20.633
ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS AFTER BEING

26:20.700 --> 26:21.900
PRESCRIBED OXYCONTIN AS A HIGH

26:21.966 --> 26:23.433
SCHOOL STUDENT -- ARE FURIOUS

26:23.500 --> 26:26.933
THAT THIS IS WHAT IT'S COME TO.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.700
>> WE WANT OUR VOICES HEARD, NOT

26:30.766 --> 26:34.066
INTERPRETED BY THE COURT LIKE

26:34.133 --> 26:35.000
THEY HAVE BEEN.

26:35.066 --> 26:36.433
I DON'T WANT SOMEBODY SAYING

26:36.500 --> 26:38.266
THAT I LOVE -- I'M SO HAPPY WITH

26:38.333 --> 26:41.666
THE SETTLEMENT AS I HEAR AT

26:41.733 --> 26:43.333
PRACTICALLY EVERY HEARING.

26:43.400 --> 26:44.433
I'M A MOM, I'M NOT HAPPY WITH

26:44.500 --> 26:45.800
ANY OF THIS, AND I KNOW HUNDREDS

26:45.866 --> 26:46.933
OF MOMS THAT AREN'T EITHER AND

26:47.000 --> 26:48.166
FAMILIES.

26:48.233 --> 26:51.100
>> John: EXACTLY.

26:51.166 --> 26:53.400
FOR SOME FAMILIES OF VICTIMS,

26:53.466 --> 26:54.433
THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR

26:54.500 --> 26:56.100
VOICES HEARD IS PRICELESS, WHICH

26:56.166 --> 26:57.466
IS TO SAY, A FUCK OF A LOT MORE

26:57.533 --> 26:59.900
THAN $48,000.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.400
SOME HAVE EVEN CALLED IN TO

27:01.466 --> 27:02.166
COURT ONLY TO BE TOLD IT WASN'T

27:02.233 --> 27:03.933
THE RIGHT FORUM.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.400
ONE WOMAN CALLED IN TO THE

27:05.466 --> 27:06.800
BANKRUPTCY HEARING AND SAID, "I

27:06.866 --> 27:08.833
LOST MY BROTHER TRAGICALLY AT

27:08.900 --> 27:10.900
THE TIP OF THE EPIDEMIC IN 2012.

27:10.966 --> 27:11.966
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN MEMORY

27:12.033 --> 27:13.700
OF MY BROTHER."

27:13.766 --> 27:15.500
TO WHICH THE JUDGE REPLIED, "I

27:15.566 --> 27:17.166
HOLD HEARINGS ON WHAT IS

27:17.233 --> 27:18.500
SCHEDULED BEFORE ME.

27:18.566 --> 27:19.466
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE

27:19.533 --> 27:20.633
PROPER FORUM TO DO THIS."

27:20.700 --> 27:28.333
AND THE THING IS, HE'S RIGHT.

27:28.400 --> 27:31.500
BUT THIS ALSO MAY BE THE LAST

27:31.566 --> 27:33.700
FORUM THESE FAMILIES HAVE TO BE

27:33.766 --> 27:34.533
HEARD.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.366
LOOK, IT MIGHT BE TRUE THAT THIS

27:35.433 --> 27:36.000
IS THE BEST DEAL WE CAN GET

27:36.066 --> 27:36.700
UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM.

27:36.766 --> 27:37.500
BUT THE FACT THAT'S THE CASE

27:37.566 --> 27:38.266
DOESN'T SPEAK TO WELL TO THIS

27:38.333 --> 27:39.366
DEAL, OR, INDEED, THE SYSTEM

27:39.433 --> 27:39.633
ITSELF.

27:39.700 --> 27:40.433
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "WELL,

27:40.500 --> 27:41.166
THE SACKLERS ARE PAYING SO MUCH

27:41.233 --> 27:42.433
ALREADY, WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?"

27:42.500 --> 27:44.633
I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT

27:44.700 --> 27:45.833
WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.700
BECAUSE I'D ARGUE THAT WHEN YOUR

27:47.766 --> 27:49.433
FAMILY'S COMPANY RECKLESSLY SOLD

27:49.500 --> 27:51.033
A PRODUCT AS DAMAGING AS

27:51.100 --> 27:53.166
OXYCONTIN, THE QUESTION MIGHT

27:53.233 --> 27:54.266
NOT BE, "HOW MANY BILLIONS IS IT

27:54.333 --> 27:56.466
RIGHT FOR YOU TO PAY?"

27:56.533 --> 27:57.700
IT'S "HOW MANY BILLIONS IS IT

27:57.766 --> 27:59.566
RIGHT FOR YOU TO KEEP?"

27:59.633 --> 28:02.066
AND I WOULD ARGUE "NO BILLIONS."

28:02.133 --> 28:05.233
AND I'M AFRAID IT GETS ONE STEP

28:05.300 --> 28:06.700
WORSE, BECAUSE THE WAY THIS

28:06.766 --> 28:08.533
SETTLEMENT IS STRUCTURED, IT'S

28:08.600 --> 28:09.933
ACTUALLY HURTING THE SACKLERS

28:10.000 --> 28:12.266
EVEN LESS THAN YOU MIGHT THINK.

28:12.333 --> 28:13.966
THAT $4.3 BILLION THEY'VE AGREED

28:14.033 --> 28:15.833
TO PAY IS SPREAD OUT OVER NINE

28:15.900 --> 28:17.400
YEARS, WITH THE LARGEST PAYMENTS

28:17.466 --> 28:18.966
COMING TOWARD THE END OF THAT

28:19.033 --> 28:20.466
PERIOD, WHICH MEANS THEY COULD

28:20.533 --> 28:22.066
MAKE THAT MONEY UP IN INTEREST

28:22.133 --> 28:24.033
AND INVESTMENTS AND NEVER HAVE

28:24.100 --> 28:26.166
TO TOUCH THE PRINCIPAL.

28:26.233 --> 28:27.933
IN FACT, WHEN THE SACKLERS ARE

28:28.000 --> 28:29.133
DONE PAYING IN 2030, THEY WILL

28:29.200 --> 28:30.633
PROBABLY BE RICHER THAN THEY ARE

28:30.700 --> 28:31.866
TODAY.

28:31.933 --> 28:33.066
SO I GUESS THE ANSWER TO

28:33.133 --> 28:34.200
"WE'RE RICH?

28:34.266 --> 28:35.933
FOR HOW LONG?" IS "DON'T WORRY,

28:36.000 --> 28:38.833
FOREVER, DAVID, BECAUSE IT SEEMS

28:38.900 --> 28:39.700
THAT'S HOW THE FUCKING SYSTEM

28:39.766 --> 28:41.366
WORKS."

28:41.433 --> 28:43.100
UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN IT COMES TO

28:43.166 --> 28:45.033
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE SACKLERS,

28:45.100 --> 28:46.533
THIS IS PROBABLY IT.

28:46.600 --> 29:01.333
BECAUSE WHILE, TECHNICALLY, THE

29:01.400 --> 29:08.900
COULD STILL BE CRIMINALLY

29:08.966 --> 29:09.566
CHARGED, NOBODY EXPECTS

29:09.633 --> 29:10.166
THAT TO HAPPEN.

29:10.233 --> 29:11.333
AND IT'S JUST INFURIATING THAT

29:11.400 --> 29:11.833
THINGS ARE SET TO END SO

29:11.900 --> 29:12.600
COMFORTABLY FOR A FAMILY THAT'S

29:12.666 --> 29:13.166
MADE SO MUCH AT THE EXPENSE OF

29:13.233 --> 29:13.933
SO MANY.

29:14.000 --> 29:14.533
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, THERE IS

29:14.600 --> 29:15.433
ONE TINY POSITIVE HERE.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.433
AND THAT'S THAT PURDUE AND THE

29:16.500 --> 29:17.633
SACKLERS HAVE ALWAYS HEAVILY

29:17.700 --> 29:18.000
VALUED SECRECY.

29:18.066 --> 29:19.066
BUT THIS DEAL REQUIRES THE

29:19.133 --> 29:19.700
CREATION OF AN ONLINE PUBLIC

29:19.766 --> 29:20.400
REPOSITORY THAT WILL EVENTUALLY

29:20.466 --> 29:21.133
CONTAIN 30 MILLION DOCUMENTS

29:21.200 --> 29:22.033
INCLUDING DEPOSITION VIDEOS AND

29:22.100 --> 29:22.900
THE SACKLERS' COMPANY EMAILS.

29:22.966 --> 29:23.866
WHICH IS UNDENIABLY GOOD.

29:23.933 --> 29:24.500
BUT EVEN WITH THAT, LET'S ADMIT,

29:24.566 --> 29:25.200
WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYTHING

29:25.266 --> 29:26.200
APPROACHING JUSTICE HERE.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.233
AND THE SACKLERS, IN SPARING NO

29:27.300 --> 29:28.200
EXPENSE, HAVE SUCCESSFULLY

29:28.266 --> 29:29.333
BOUGHT THEIR WAY OUT OF THIS

29:29.400 --> 29:31.266
PROBLEM.

29:31.333 --> 29:32.600
WELL, NOT NO EXPENSE.

29:32.666 --> 29:33.900
BECAUSE AGAIN, DESPITE SPENDING

29:33.966 --> 29:35.500
MILLIONS ON LAWYERS, AND EVEN

29:35.566 --> 29:36.600
CREATING A WEBSITE FILLED WITH

29:36.666 --> 29:38.466
LEGAL PROPAGANDA, THEY STILL

29:38.533 --> 29:40.433
SOMEHOW COULDN'T SCRAPE UP THE

29:40.500 --> 29:42.033
$2,500 REQUIRED TO BUY THE

29:42.100 --> 29:43.833
DOT-COM FOR IT.

29:43.900 --> 29:47.066
AND THE REASON I HAPPEN TO KNOW

29:47.133 --> 29:48.600
EXACTLY HOW MUCH IT COSTS IS

29:48.666 --> 29:50.033
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW MUCH WE SPENT

29:50.100 --> 29:50.533
TO BUY IT.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.900
IT'S TRUE: WE BOUGHT

29:51.966 --> 29:52.600
JudgeForYourselves.com,

29:52.666 --> 29:53.733
AND I KNOW THAT IT DOES

29:53.800 --> 29:54.433
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO EVEN THE

29:54.500 --> 29:57.833
SCALES HERE.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.400
BUT IT DOES GIVES ME THE TINIEST

29:59.466 --> 30:00.966
BIT OF COMFORT TO IMAGINE IT

30:01.033 --> 30:03.633
MIGHT IRRITATE THE SACKLERS JUST

30:03.700 --> 30:04.700
A BIT TO KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE

30:04.766 --> 30:05.300
GO TO THAT SITE IN THE FUTURE,

30:05.366 --> 30:07.900
THIS IS WHAT THEY'LL SEE.

30:07.966 --> 30:09.600
>> HI, IT'S ME.

30:23.866 --> 30:30.700
BUT YOU GOTTA GET THE DOT-COM!

30:30.766 --> 30:31.266
[LAUGHS]

30:31.333 --> 30:32.033
WHAT KIND OF FUCKING IDIOT WOULD

30:32.100 --> 30:32.666
SET UP AN IMPORTANT WEBSITE AND

30:32.733 --> 30:34.866
NOT BUY THE DOT-COM?

30:34.933 --> 30:36.766
I DUNNO!

30:36.833 --> 30:38.200
I DUNNO!

30:38.266 --> 30:42.266
ANYWAY, IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH,

30:42.333 --> 30:45.833
YOU'VE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

30:45.900 --> 30:46.366
SO CLICK AROUND, OKAY?

30:46.433 --> 30:47.833
GET A SENSE OF WHAT MY TERRIBLE

30:47.900 --> 30:48.866
FAMILY HAS DONE.

30:48.933 --> 30:49.766
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'LL THROW IN

30:49.833 --> 30:50.766
SOME MAKE-UP TIDBITS.

30:50.833 --> 30:51.733
I DON'T KNOW.

30:51.800 --> 30:52.666
MAYBE HOW TO MAKE A GREAT PESTO

30:52.733 --> 30:54.000
CHICKEN.

30:54.066 --> 30:55.533
ANYWAY, THERE'S SOME GREAT

30:55.600 --> 30:57.366
BUTTONS THAT YOU PRESS AROUND

30:57.433 --> 30:58.600
AND YOU'LL GET THERE SOMEHOW.

30:58.666 --> 30:59.633
ANYWAY, BEST OF LUCK TO YOU.

30:59.700 --> 31:00.900
ALL RIGHT.

31:00.966 --> 31:08.066
BYE-BYE.

31:08.133 --> 31:10.066
>> John: THANK YOU,

31:10.133 --> 31:10.966
RICHARD SACKLER.

31:11.033 --> 31:11.833
THIS NEW WEBSITE LETS

31:11.900 --> 31:12.433
YOU "JUDGE FOR YOURSELVES"

31:12.500 --> 31:13.066
WHETHER THE SACKLERS GOT OFF TOO

31:13.133 --> 31:13.966
EASY -- WHICH THEY DID.

31:14.033 --> 31:14.500
ON IT, YOU CAN SEE RICHARD

31:14.566 --> 31:15.166
SACKLER'S FULL DEPOSITION, ALL

31:15.233 --> 31:16.133
OF OUR EPISODES ABOUT THE

31:16.200 --> 31:17.166
OPIOIDS CRISIS, AND THERE'S EVEN

31:17.233 --> 31:17.966
A LINK THAT WILL EVENTUALLY

31:18.033 --> 31:18.900
DIRECT YOU TO THE DOCUMENT

31:18.966 --> 31:20.433
REPOSITORY THE MOMENT IT'S

31:20.500 --> 31:21.866
LAUNCHED.

31:21.933 --> 31:23.066
ALSO, BECAUSE THE FAMILIES OF

31:23.133 --> 31:24.666
THOSE IMPACTED BY THE SACKLERS

31:24.733 --> 31:25.933
HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN HEARD, THERE

31:26.000 --> 31:27.366
ARE SOME EXCERPTS ON THE WEBSITE

31:27.433 --> 31:28.266
OF WHAT SOME OF THEM WANTED TO

31:28.333 --> 31:29.666
SAY.

31:29.733 --> 31:30.833
ALL OF THIS WILL BE UP AS LONG

31:30.900 --> 31:33.100
AS WE OWN THE DOMAIN.

31:33.166 --> 31:35.500
AND THIS IS AT LEAST SOMETHING

31:35.566 --> 31:37.100
THE SACKLERS CAN'T THROW THEIR

31:37.166 --> 31:39.100
DIRTY MONEY AT AND MAKE GO AWAY.

31:39.166 --> 31:40.266
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT

31:40.333 --> 31:41.266
ISN'T FOR SALE AT ALL,

31:41.333 --> 31:42.533
SACKLER FAMILY.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.700
IT'S AVAILABLE FOR A PRICE.

31:45.766 --> 31:47.466
LET'S SAY $10 BILLION.

31:47.533 --> 31:48.666
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

31:48.733 --> 31:49.766
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

31:49.833 --> 31:50.800
