00:00.553 --> 00:03.220
Reverie, a virtual reality program

00:03.222 --> 00:05.222
where the impossible becomes possible.

00:05.842 --> 00:08.575
Anything you desire you can find here.

00:09.088 --> 00:11.295
But sometimes, people get lost,

00:11.297 --> 00:13.998
caught between fantasy and reality.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.499
That's where she comes in.

00:15.501 --> 00:17.801
Her name is Mara Kint.

00:17.803 --> 00:21.906
Her job, find the lost ones
and bring them home.

00:21.908 --> 00:24.575
And maybe by saving them,

00:24.577 --> 00:28.078
she just might find a way
to save herself.

Previously on "Reverie"...

00:38.805 --> 00:40.539
- I know you're in danger.
- What kind of danger?

00:40.573 --> 00:41.940
Losing your mind.

00:41.974 --> 00:43.975
Is Oliver right? Am I going to go crazy?

00:44.010 --> 00:46.912
Oliver was unstable
long before he got a BCI.

00:46.946 --> 00:49.214
Stop, no!

00:49.248 --> 00:51.483
I got shot. Should I be worried?

00:51.517 --> 00:52.751
I'm really sorry, by the way,

00:52.785 --> 00:54.586
that I didn't return your calls.

00:54.620 --> 00:56.288
The calls I made 19 months ago?

00:56.322 --> 00:57.389
I've been thinking about you.

00:57.423 --> 00:59.424
Can we talk later?

01:24.851 --> 01:27.529
I was wondering
when you'd finally get up.

01:28.121 --> 01:29.588
Good morning.

01:33.526 --> 01:35.954
Okay, out with it.

01:36.829 --> 01:40.298
- No, no, it's nothing.
- Mara.

01:45.037 --> 01:46.471
Okay.

01:47.807 --> 01:50.308
Do you think this was a good idea?

01:50.343 --> 01:53.278
You think I would
still be here if I didn't?

01:53.312 --> 01:55.098
Come on.

01:56.308 --> 01:57.783
- Yeah, I probably would.
- You know.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.605
What about you, do you think
this was a good idea?

02:03.156 --> 02:06.358
You know, okay, all right,
here's the thing, I just...

02:06.392 --> 02:08.126
I feel like, um...

02:08.161 --> 02:12.939
It's been a while since
you and I have been together.

02:12.973 --> 02:14.060
Mm-hmm.

02:14.094 --> 02:18.303
And it's really easy to just
fall into old behaviors,

02:18.337 --> 02:19.805
because they're comfortable,

02:19.839 --> 02:24.253
and I'm really
overthinking this, aren't I?

02:30.416 --> 02:32.094
I'm good.

02:32.385 --> 02:35.854
- I hope you are, too.
- I want to be.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.227
Yes.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.605
Yes, I am.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.774
Then...

02:46.365 --> 02:48.285
Everything's okay?

02:48.320 --> 02:49.534
It is.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.570
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.136
Here you go.

03:15.494 --> 03:16.561
Here you are.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.602
Pilar, Georgie said you were feeling...

03:58.537 --> 04:00.349
What are you doing?

04:02.108 --> 04:03.275
Apertus.

04:16.555 --> 04:19.591
- Pilar!
- Hola, Senor Castillo!

04:32.964 --> 04:36.007
- Mi hijitas.
- Pilar!

04:36.042 --> 04:37.709
Pilar.

04:37.743 --> 04:40.178
I was waiting for the sun to shine.

04:44.750 --> 04:48.019
So, I hear they serve the
best pisco sours in this bar.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.021
Let's find out.

04:55.494 --> 04:58.715
Obviously my staff had no
idea what Pilar was doing.

04:58.749 --> 05:00.465
If we had known
she was using your program,

05:00.499 --> 05:02.133
we would have put a stop to it instantly.

05:02.168 --> 05:05.198
Mara, this is Jack Selve.
He's executive director

05:05.232 --> 05:07.572
- of Shady Pines Assisted Living.
- Hi, how are you?

05:07.606 --> 05:10.542
One of his residents is a client of ours.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.504
Pilar Simonet.

05:13.012 --> 05:15.413
Mr. Selve, you make it sound like

05:15.448 --> 05:17.215
she's doing drugs or something.

05:17.676 --> 05:20.218
We work very hard
to keep our residents engaged

05:20.252 --> 05:23.822
with the outside world,
keep them active, social.

05:23.856 --> 05:25.824
If we gave them Reverie,
all of that would mean nothing.

05:25.858 --> 05:28.259
They'd never come out.
Pilar is a case in point.

05:28.294 --> 05:31.363
Well, you and I may disagree,
but it is her choice.

05:31.397 --> 05:34.266
Pilar has lung cancer.
Thanks to your program,

05:34.301 --> 05:35.834
she's missing a round of treatment today.

05:35.868 --> 05:39.037
And not eating, and not
getting physical therapy.

05:39.071 --> 05:42.407
Mr. Selve, how did Pilar get the program?

05:42.441 --> 05:44.536
It's not like she drove herself here.

05:45.162 --> 05:47.512
Apparently, she bribed one of our aides.

05:47.546 --> 05:49.080
Ex-aides.

05:49.115 --> 05:52.684
And she's been visiting
your facility repeatedly,

05:52.718 --> 05:55.720
under the guise of
hairdressing appointments.

05:55.755 --> 05:57.222
Clever lady.

05:57.256 --> 05:58.923
We think Pilar has been sneaking time

05:58.958 --> 06:00.592
in the Reverie program
for the past two weeks,

06:00.626 --> 06:02.060
Which is probably why her health

06:02.094 --> 06:04.696
has gotten significantly worse.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.131
We can't have it.

06:06.165 --> 06:08.546
Now when I called, Mr. Ventana explained

06:08.580 --> 06:10.702
that you could extract
people from Reveries?

06:11.367 --> 06:12.637
Something like that.

06:12.671 --> 06:15.206
What Pilar is doing
is a danger to herself

06:15.241 --> 06:17.242
and a bad example for our community.

06:17.276 --> 06:20.812
I want her out of the program
by this time tomorrow.

06:20.846 --> 06:24.049
If not, I'll be forced to take action.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.550
What action?

06:25.584 --> 06:26.951
Pilar will have to leave Shady Pines

06:26.986 --> 06:29.120
and be transferred to a state facility.

06:29.581 --> 06:31.656
What's her family have to say about that?

06:31.690 --> 06:35.260
She has no family.
Never married, no children.

06:35.294 --> 06:37.729
Well, wait, so you're
just going to toss her out?

06:37.763 --> 06:39.731
I mean, that seems
a bit harsh, don't you think?

06:39.765 --> 06:42.634
I'm responsible to all of our residents.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.803
What I'm doing is in their best interest.

06:44.837 --> 06:46.771
Now if you'll excuse me.

06:50.676 --> 06:52.644
Okay.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.580
Let's see what you're up to.

06:55.614 --> 06:56.748
Apertus.

07:28.747 --> 07:30.248
Puh-lar?

07:31.750 --> 07:34.385
Puh-lar Simonet?

07:34.420 --> 07:36.788
It's pronounced "Pilar."

07:36.822 --> 07:40.525
Oh, wow, program really
messed up with your outfit.

07:40.559 --> 07:42.160
You don't look period at all.

07:42.194 --> 07:45.363
Oh, well, that's because
I'm not part of the program.

07:45.397 --> 07:48.533
Mara Kint, from Onira-Tech.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.037
Oh...

07:52.205 --> 07:54.749
Did Jack Selve send you in after me?

07:55.458 --> 07:57.342
He tell you I've been a bad girl?

07:59.378 --> 08:01.646
Well, kind of, yeah.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.481
Well, he's just worried about you.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.483
The cancer?

08:05.518 --> 08:09.053
Querida, I've been dying for a while.

08:09.088 --> 08:11.489
Cancer and I are best friends.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.925
Well he also says that
if you don't leave the program,

08:13.959 --> 08:15.860
he's going to move you from Shady Pines

08:15.895 --> 08:18.591
into a state facility, immediately.

08:18.626 --> 08:19.764
What?

08:19.798 --> 08:21.766
No, that place is like
a prison, he can't do that.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.654
He can, and I'm pretty sure that he will.

08:25.237 --> 08:28.940
I can see how much fun
that you're having.

08:28.974 --> 08:31.676
I bet this place is a great
escape from Shady Pines,

08:31.710 --> 08:33.778
but it's time to go home now.

08:33.812 --> 08:35.880
Shh-shh-shh.

08:35.914 --> 08:39.250
- You hear that?
- What?

08:39.284 --> 08:40.919
It's happening.

08:49.962 --> 08:51.229
We've got to get out of here!

08:51.263 --> 08:53.932
Go? No, this is my second chance.

08:53.966 --> 08:55.867
- At what?
- Everything.

08:55.901 --> 08:58.903
I have things to do.
I'm not letting go of that.

09:30.914 --> 09:32.832
Her Reverie is in Latin America?

09:32.866 --> 09:35.083
Yeah, Central or South,
I'm not exactly sure which,

09:35.117 --> 09:36.384
With like a, uh...

09:36.855 --> 09:40.116
a distinct early '70s vibe.

09:40.141 --> 09:41.541
Sounds kind of sexy.

09:41.576 --> 09:43.377
Oh, it was until the shooting started.

09:43.411 --> 09:45.002
This wasn't historical tourism, Paul.

09:45.036 --> 09:47.814
This was something
that she was anticipating.

09:47.849 --> 09:50.450
I mean, she was just
waiting for this to happen.

09:50.485 --> 09:52.786
Okay, I pulled a favor
with a buddy of mine

09:52.820 --> 09:54.121
from the State Department.

09:54.155 --> 09:55.822
Pilar's parents were from Mexico.

09:55.857 --> 09:59.559
She was born in Phoenix.
In 1973, she went on a trip.

09:59.594 --> 10:05.399
Got visas for Bolivia, Brazil,
Chile, Ecuador, and Peru.

10:05.433 --> 10:08.466
That doesn't exactly narrow it down.

10:09.637 --> 10:13.407
There was a poster
in the bar for a concert.

10:13.441 --> 10:16.243
Uh, I think it said Sacros?

10:16.277 --> 10:19.613
Hey, Dylan, can you search Sacros,

10:19.647 --> 10:21.648
along with all the countries
that Charlie named?

10:21.683 --> 10:25.135
Sacros, a psychedelic rock
band from Santiago, Chile.

10:25.169 --> 10:26.820
Their album was set to be released

10:26.854 --> 10:28.789
on September 18, 1973,

10:28.823 --> 10:30.791
but never officially came out.

10:30.825 --> 10:34.394
- Why not?
- Probably because of the coup.

10:36.453 --> 10:38.246
The coup in Chile?

10:38.700 --> 10:40.467
Oh, come on, children, read your history.

10:40.501 --> 10:43.804
In 1973, the Chilean army
engineered a coup d'etat

10:43.838 --> 10:46.306
that forced the president to step down.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.809
So, Pilar's Reverie is watching

10:48.843 --> 10:51.211
a military dictatorship
take over the country?

10:51.245 --> 10:53.113
I'm sure it's all sorts of fun, but why?

10:53.147 --> 10:55.816
Well, that's what
I need to figure out, and fast.

10:55.850 --> 10:58.218
There's nobody else but us
looking out for her.

10:58.252 --> 11:01.321
I have a board meeting. Keep me posted.

11:04.692 --> 11:09.563
Um, are you going to go
back in right away?

11:09.597 --> 11:11.164
I have to.

11:11.199 --> 11:13.834
Pilar's in the street if I
can't get her to come out. Why?

11:13.868 --> 11:17.537
Oh, just wondering about the bruising.

11:18.077 --> 11:20.640
Oh, you mean from when I got shot?

11:20.675 --> 11:24.478
Yeah, it, um, it's getting better.

11:24.512 --> 11:26.880
Are you worried that
it's going to happen again?

11:29.751 --> 11:33.320
The Reverie experience
isn't supposed to leave a mark.

11:33.354 --> 11:34.755
That's sort of the point.

11:34.789 --> 11:37.324
And I can't explain why yours did.

11:37.358 --> 11:39.192
It concerns me.

11:39.227 --> 11:41.561
Well, um, I've decided that

11:41.596 --> 11:43.230
I'm not going to worry about it,

11:43.264 --> 11:44.664
because you and Alexis
are gonna figure it out,

11:44.699 --> 11:46.900
and everything else is going to be fine.

11:48.269 --> 11:49.903
You're in an awfully good mood.

11:49.937 --> 11:51.671
Any particular reason?

11:52.740 --> 11:55.365
All right then.

11:56.444 --> 11:58.211
Apertus.

12:12.593 --> 12:14.259
Pilar.

12:14.829 --> 12:18.698
I had a bad dream, that
the soldiers came and got me.

12:18.733 --> 12:22.135
Oh, honey, they won't.
In here, you're safe.

12:22.170 --> 12:23.904
My friend told me so.

12:23.938 --> 12:25.853
What friend?

12:29.010 --> 12:30.377
Now you just hold on to her,

12:30.411 --> 12:32.679
and everything's going to be okay.

12:34.982 --> 12:36.783
Okay, go to sleep.

12:38.352 --> 12:39.993
Psst. Pilar.

12:47.528 --> 12:49.763
It's past curfew.
You shouldn't be here, Joaquin.

12:57.552 --> 13:00.607
- If things were different...
- I would still be a professor.

13:00.641 --> 13:02.476
And I wouldn't have met you.

13:04.946 --> 13:06.436
Te amo, Pilar.

13:07.482 --> 13:10.350
- Oh, Joaquin.
- Before we go do this,

13:10.384 --> 13:12.275
I will come see you tomorrow.

13:23.297 --> 13:25.131
Pilar!

13:25.166 --> 13:26.873
Ay, que susto!

13:28.124 --> 13:30.136
Shame on you for scaring me like that.

13:30.171 --> 13:31.605
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...

13:31.639 --> 13:33.640
Should never rush up
on an old woman that way.

13:33.674 --> 13:35.141
You're right, you're right.

13:35.176 --> 13:39.012
- What are you doing here?
- I understand now.

13:39.046 --> 13:42.148
You built the Reverie because of Joaquin.

13:42.183 --> 13:45.485
Oh, dios mio, this woman
will be the death of me.

13:45.892 --> 13:49.856
Ms. Kint, stay out of my business.

13:52.940 --> 13:55.962
Oh, God, that hurts.

13:55.997 --> 13:57.664
What is happening to me?

13:57.698 --> 13:59.232
Being in the program
is making you sicker.

13:59.267 --> 14:00.700
It's affecting you out there,

14:00.735 --> 14:02.469
and that is making you
feel worse in here.

14:02.503 --> 14:05.472
- You need to leave now, Pilar.
- No, I need to stay in here.

14:05.506 --> 14:07.374
- Me being here matters more.
- Pilar.

14:07.408 --> 14:08.808
Stay away from me!

14:08.843 --> 14:10.977
Sister! Es Pilar.

14:20.773 --> 14:22.047
It's not possible.

14:22.048 --> 14:24.639
I saw the bruise on her skin
after she came out.

14:25.556 --> 14:28.354
Parasympathetic reactions
to Reverie actions

14:28.388 --> 14:30.055
stop at the Anteroom door.

14:30.090 --> 14:32.525
That's what we always
thought, but not anymore.

14:32.559 --> 14:34.026
Look, there are precedents.

14:34.060 --> 14:36.896
Women with false pregnancy
believe they're pregnant.

14:36.930 --> 14:38.797
So the mind produces hormones,

14:38.832 --> 14:40.733
which produce symptoms of pregnancy.

14:40.767 --> 14:42.668
The mind creates the physical state.

14:42.702 --> 14:45.404
Hmm, you're saying she's pregnant, too?

14:45.438 --> 14:47.706
I am saying

14:47.741 --> 14:50.075
that Reverie is designed
to fool the brain

14:50.110 --> 14:53.712
into thinking that something
that doesn't exist is real.

14:53.747 --> 14:54.914
That may have more profound

14:54.948 --> 14:57.182
physical consequences than we thought.

14:59.753 --> 15:02.187
Somebody we both know
warned us about this.

15:04.090 --> 15:08.227
That was pure conjecture.
We were blue skying "what ifs."

15:08.261 --> 15:11.330
I don't see the worry here.
What happened is a one-off.

15:11.364 --> 15:13.499
- A fluke.
- Unless it isn't.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.268
What if next time, Mara comes
back and it's not a bruise?

15:16.303 --> 15:17.836
It's an open wound.

15:17.871 --> 15:19.672
Are you willing to risk that?
Because I'm not.

15:19.706 --> 15:22.113
Why are you so worried about her?

15:22.642 --> 15:24.109
What... I'm not!

15:24.144 --> 15:26.078
Look, I am concerned

15:26.112 --> 15:29.315
about how this affects
the program moving forward.

15:33.453 --> 15:37.756
You know he understands more
about this than anybody else.

15:38.129 --> 15:39.755
We should talk to him.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.962
I'll make the call if you don't want to.

15:42.996 --> 15:44.427
No!

15:45.999 --> 15:47.967
- I'll look into it.
- Alexis.

15:48.001 --> 15:50.235
I said I'd look into it.

16:23.436 --> 16:25.551
Hey there, stranger.

16:47.193 --> 16:50.996
This, my friends, is a story about love.

16:51.031 --> 16:53.032
- Really.
- Go on.

16:53.066 --> 16:55.100
Pilar never married.

16:55.135 --> 16:58.170
She never had kids. Why?

16:58.204 --> 17:01.707
- Because of Joaquin Alcazar.
- Who's Joaquin Alcazar?

17:01.741 --> 17:03.676
- Dylan?
- Joaquin Alcazar

17:03.710 --> 17:06.612
was a professor of literature
at the University of Chile.

17:06.646 --> 17:09.948
He became a leader
in the revolutionary movement.

17:09.983 --> 17:11.717
He's the man that I saw kissing Pilar.

17:11.751 --> 17:13.519
Are you stalking her in there?

17:13.553 --> 17:16.855
He got killed leading a rebel
group against the military.

17:16.890 --> 17:19.223
She never saw him again after that.

17:19.259 --> 17:22.661
So you think Joaquin's the
reason Pilar built her Reverie?

17:22.695 --> 17:25.297
But you said she'll never see
Joaquin in there again.

17:25.330 --> 17:26.632
If that's why she built the Reverie,

17:26.665 --> 17:28.567
then why isn't she coming out?

17:28.601 --> 17:32.171
She got what she wanted,
but it just... it wasn't enough.

17:32.205 --> 17:35.808
- She needed something else.
- So how do we fix that?

17:35.842 --> 17:37.309
By giving her the opportunity

17:37.343 --> 17:40.312
for a full-on romantic
moment with Joaquin.

17:40.346 --> 17:42.214
She gets to say what she wants to say.

17:42.248 --> 17:44.383
She gets to do what she wants to do.

17:44.417 --> 17:45.718
You give her that,

17:45.752 --> 17:47.720
and I promise she's going to come out.

17:47.754 --> 17:49.254
But remember though.

17:49.289 --> 17:52.224
Even the slightest influence
by you inside the Reverie

17:52.258 --> 17:54.560
can change everything in Pilar's story.

17:54.594 --> 17:56.195
You sure that's all right?

17:56.229 --> 17:58.430
I think it's the best way
to get her out quickly.

17:58.465 --> 18:00.499
I mean, we can't afford
to wait her out, right?

18:00.533 --> 18:03.190
She's stabilized, but who knows
how long that will last?

18:04.191 --> 18:06.839
And I'm going to need a little
something when I go in.

18:07.486 --> 18:10.743
Hello, hi, excuse me?

18:10.777 --> 18:13.479
Can I, what, uh... Hey!

18:15.081 --> 18:16.548
Okay, good, all right.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.184
I am looking for a man
named Joaquin Alcazar.

18:19.219 --> 18:22.354
I am sure that all of you know who he is.

18:22.388 --> 18:25.591
And this...

18:25.625 --> 18:28.427
is for the first person
who can take me to him.

18:32.465 --> 18:33.766
Pilar, hang on.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.300
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

18:35.335 --> 18:37.136
What do you want? I can't be late.

18:37.170 --> 18:38.771
I know what Joaquin means to you.

18:38.805 --> 18:40.372
He said he loved you.

18:40.406 --> 18:43.208
And men say a lot of things
before they go off to war.

18:43.243 --> 18:46.145
- Besides, what's done is done.
- But it doesn't have to be!

18:46.179 --> 18:49.948
Reverie isn't the real world. In here...

18:51.484 --> 18:53.051
Anything can happen!

18:54.075 --> 18:55.654
What is he doing here?

18:55.688 --> 18:57.122
I brought him here for you!

18:57.157 --> 18:58.457
What do you mean
you brought him here for me?

18:58.491 --> 19:00.893
He's supposed to be leading the raid!

19:00.927 --> 19:02.661
You're supposed to be leading the raid!

19:02.695 --> 19:03.796
But I am here for you.

19:04.251 --> 19:05.798
He can't be here.

19:08.935 --> 19:11.503
But I thought that's what you wanted?

19:11.538 --> 19:13.172
And why would I want that?

19:13.206 --> 19:15.107
Because you got it in your bird
brain that this is what I want?

19:15.141 --> 19:18.343
You didn't ask me!
You just decided for me!

19:18.378 --> 19:22.080
Just like everyone else.
The government, Shady Pines.

19:22.115 --> 19:23.849
Everyone's got an opinion about my life.

19:23.883 --> 19:25.284
There's so many, there's no room for me

19:25.318 --> 19:28.192
to have one of my own, not even in here.

19:29.455 --> 19:31.356
What's happening?

19:31.391 --> 19:34.459
What do you mean? You did this.

19:39.065 --> 19:42.301
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

19:46.739 --> 19:48.440
Por favor!

20:07.060 --> 20:09.261
No!

20:10.997 --> 20:13.332
Pilar, help us!

20:27.671 --> 20:30.872
The soldiers are holding the
girls inside of a schoolhouse.

20:31.422 --> 20:32.641
That's where they're taking people

20:32.675 --> 20:34.676
to question them about the rebels.

20:35.217 --> 20:38.447
But why take the girls?
They're just children.

20:40.416 --> 20:43.452
It's easier to force
the truth out of them.

20:44.687 --> 20:46.604
I'm so sorry, Pilar.

20:47.354 --> 20:49.391
When I saw you and Joaquin together,

20:49.425 --> 20:51.727
and then I learned that he died,

20:51.761 --> 20:54.396
I just thought that you
came here because of love.

20:54.653 --> 20:56.071
I did.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.908
For those girls.

21:02.328 --> 21:04.973
Okay, I really messed this up.

21:06.576 --> 21:08.459
I shouldn't have assumed.

21:09.210 --> 21:10.946
But those girls aren't really gone.

21:11.629 --> 21:12.948
If you want to see them again,
all you have to do

21:12.982 --> 21:15.751
is just leave the program and restart it.

21:16.501 --> 21:17.601
Oh.

21:17.626 --> 21:20.622
You really think Jack Selve
is going to let me do that?

21:20.657 --> 21:23.792
- Give me one last ride?
- Well, I could ask.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.978
Pilar, what really happened here?

21:32.769 --> 21:36.038
I was on a cultural homestay in Chile.

21:36.072 --> 21:40.275
And on this exact day, 45 years ago,

21:40.309 --> 21:42.477
I fled town with those girls.

21:42.512 --> 21:44.579
I piled them into
the back of a stolen van,

21:44.614 --> 21:46.948
and I drove them to the border.

21:46.983 --> 21:49.451
Away from the soldiers and the shooting.

21:49.485 --> 21:51.520
You saved them.

21:53.456 --> 21:54.956
The only reason we were able to escape

21:54.991 --> 21:56.458
was because the soldiers were busy

21:56.492 --> 21:58.627
with the resistance fighters.

21:59.635 --> 22:01.428
Joaquin's men.

22:02.331 --> 22:06.301
I had the whole thing
set up here, just like before.

22:06.850 --> 22:09.137
Only this time, the soldiers
aren't busy with the men,

22:09.172 --> 22:11.506
because Joaquin's not there to lead them.

22:12.532 --> 22:15.644
Because I... I brought him to you.

22:15.678 --> 22:18.680
I just wanted that feeling one more time.

22:18.715 --> 22:21.983
That my life had purpose,
that it meant something.

22:22.018 --> 22:25.020
But now, any hope of that is gone.

22:25.054 --> 22:27.122
Thanks to you.

22:35.865 --> 22:38.467
- Thank you for coming.
- It's good to see you.

22:38.882 --> 22:40.676
In this very public place.

22:41.677 --> 22:45.974
No problem, I get it.
So what's the big secret?

22:46.008 --> 22:48.844
- Who said I have a secret?
- Come on, Lex.

22:48.878 --> 22:50.612
Charlie would never let you
come by yourself,

22:50.646 --> 22:52.380
which means you didn't tell him.

22:52.415 --> 22:54.516
Ergo, secret.

22:55.733 --> 22:59.187
The 2.0 prototype crossed
paths with a secondary program.

22:59.695 --> 23:01.823
- East Berlin.
- There was an anomaly.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.993
A physical manifestation
of an injury in Reverie.

23:05.027 --> 23:07.763
- Was it you?
- Mara Kint.

23:08.998 --> 23:10.665
Kint. What happened to her?

23:11.040 --> 23:13.917
Bruising, on the abdomen.

23:14.737 --> 23:17.588
Caused by a virtual gunshot wound.

23:18.922 --> 23:20.342
I warned you this could happen, I said...

23:20.376 --> 23:21.743
Oliver, can we skip this part?

23:21.778 --> 23:23.345
I told you that we needed safeguards.

23:23.379 --> 23:25.380
And now I'm agreeing with you.

23:25.414 --> 23:26.972
Okay?

23:32.436 --> 23:34.723
I could use some help
identifying the glitch.

23:38.567 --> 23:40.228
Please.

23:41.430 --> 23:43.899
You said this wasn't
your main code, what was it?

23:44.323 --> 23:46.001
An experimental Reverie.

23:46.533 --> 23:48.937
The exit function was disabled.

23:48.971 --> 23:50.120
Why?

23:50.773 --> 23:53.041
- Detainment.
- Forced detainment?

23:56.435 --> 23:58.269
Well, as much as I hate to admit it,

23:58.303 --> 23:59.904
It's quite possible
this has nothing to do

23:59.938 --> 24:01.472
with regular 2.0

24:03.275 --> 24:05.242
- Then what?
- Crossed Reveries.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.844
Weakens the bond between the BCI

24:06.878 --> 24:08.412
and the parasympathetic nervous system.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.214
When the bullet hit Kint,
she wasn't in deep enough

24:10.248 --> 24:12.416
for the body to ignore
the signal from her brain.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.352
Tensing up all the muscles
in her abdomen.

24:14.386 --> 24:17.388
An internal injury caused
by an autonomic response.

24:20.492 --> 24:22.626
A bit like getting a bruise

24:22.661 --> 24:26.263
from throwing up after
one too many daiquiris.

24:27.933 --> 24:30.501
Ugh, I remember that.

24:37.309 --> 24:41.946
This is the file name
and the number of the memo.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.781
It outlines safeguards,
and gives suggestions

24:43.815 --> 24:45.549
on where and how to amend the code.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.421
I could do more.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.924
If you let me back in.

25:06.371 --> 25:10.574
"Planet of the Petechia"?
Your titles are so terrible.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.647
But... thank you.

25:16.681 --> 25:18.625
You're welcome.

25:24.762 --> 25:26.329
The military?

25:27.492 --> 25:29.493
- What?
- Forced detainment,

25:29.528 --> 25:31.949
the exit disabled, a gunshot wound.

25:31.984 --> 25:33.796
You've given the source code
to the military.

25:33.830 --> 25:35.053
- Oliver.
- After everything we

25:35.087 --> 25:36.625
talked about, how dangerous this would be

25:36.660 --> 25:38.335
- in the wrong hands...
- It's not what you think.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.504
No, it's worse, it's giving a loaded gun

25:40.539 --> 25:41.940
to a three-year-old!

25:47.679 --> 25:49.413
Don't do this, all right?

25:53.985 --> 25:57.254
You need to stop it, now.

26:01.726 --> 26:04.463
I understand how you feel.

26:05.163 --> 26:08.592
But you don't get to decide
what I do with Onira-Tech.

26:09.367 --> 26:11.135
Not anymore.

26:12.437 --> 26:13.889
No.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.240
You're right.

26:16.274 --> 26:18.075
It's not my company, it's yours.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.104
My bad, as they say.

26:27.018 --> 26:29.019
Take care of yourself, okay?

26:47.015 --> 26:48.068
Absolutely not.

26:48.102 --> 26:50.468
Mr. Selve, if Pilar starts
the program over again,

26:50.502 --> 26:52.647
she can have the experience
she was always looking for

26:52.682 --> 26:54.334
and be done with Reverie for good.

26:54.368 --> 26:56.298
You're asking me to violate policy.

26:56.323 --> 26:59.526
I am asking you to let
an old woman live again.

27:01.061 --> 27:02.795
You said it yourself,
you want these people

27:02.830 --> 27:05.198
to engage in life.
Well, that's what she's doing.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.353
Now more than ever.

27:06.387 --> 27:08.868
Please, this is such
an easy thing to say yes to.

27:08.903 --> 27:12.138
Ms. Kint. I have 116 patients with

27:12.173 --> 27:14.874
complicated, life-threatening
medical issues.

27:14.909 --> 27:17.877
My job is to keep them alive
for as long as I possibly can.

27:17.912 --> 27:21.381
I will not put
a very frail, very sick woman

27:21.415 --> 27:23.316
at unnecessary risk.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.502
The answer remains no.

27:27.546 --> 27:30.223
I asked you to return her
by this afternoon.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.675
Will you be able to?

27:32.426 --> 27:34.094
I'm working on it.

27:44.738 --> 27:46.806
Hey, Pilar.

27:50.010 --> 27:51.511
It's me.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.447
Mara.

28:30.651 --> 28:32.085
Now you just hold on to her,

28:32.119 --> 28:34.220
and everything's going to be okay.

28:40.494 --> 28:42.095
The facility took away Pilar's tablet,

28:42.129 --> 28:43.896
and they won't let her
restart her Reverie,

28:43.931 --> 28:46.532
but she won't leave until
she gets those girls back.

28:46.567 --> 28:47.967
And if she doesn't
get those girls back today,

28:48.002 --> 28:49.369
then they're going to kick her out.

28:49.403 --> 28:52.422
I would like to go back in and help her.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.874
- Paul?
- I'm guessing this involves

28:54.908 --> 28:57.610
engaging with armed military avatars?

28:57.645 --> 28:59.646
Okay, look. I screwed up.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.814
I have to fix it, and if I'm lucky,

29:01.849 --> 29:03.809
maybe I'll get her out in the process.

29:07.041 --> 29:08.397
Well then.

29:08.922 --> 29:11.066
Let's go save some kids, shall we?

29:21.635 --> 29:23.203
What does Selve say?

29:23.971 --> 29:26.239
He said absolutely not.

29:26.273 --> 29:28.007
I told you.

29:28.042 --> 29:29.742
Well, I don't care what he said.

29:29.777 --> 29:31.010
And neither should you.

29:31.045 --> 29:33.179
I am going to do everything that I can

29:33.213 --> 29:34.947
to help you get what you came for.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.983
As long as you're still willing to fight.

29:37.017 --> 29:39.452
I'll do anything for those girls.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.754
I was hoping you'd say that.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.860
There's soldiers everywhere.

29:47.895 --> 29:50.830
- How are we going to get in?
- Okay.

29:50.864 --> 29:54.967
Step one, create a distraction.

29:55.002 --> 29:57.203
- What is that?
- C-4.

29:57.237 --> 30:00.198
- The explosive?
- Oh, yeah.

30:01.375 --> 30:03.326
Okay, let's go.

30:10.317 --> 30:13.619
- I'd say you distracted them.
- Now what?

30:13.654 --> 30:16.522
Step two, follow me.

30:22.529 --> 30:23.980
Let's go.

30:36.860 --> 30:38.544
You see anything?

30:43.170 --> 30:45.538
- Pilar!
- Pilar, you came for us!

30:45.786 --> 30:47.987
I never would have left without you.

30:48.021 --> 30:50.582
Are you okay? Yeah, okay.

30:51.291 --> 30:53.726
- We have to go now.
- Okay, let's go.

30:53.761 --> 30:55.661
- Okay.
- Let's go.

31:08.976 --> 31:11.110
Okay, stay down.

31:11.145 --> 31:14.347
Stay down and follow me.
Let's go, let's go.

31:14.381 --> 31:16.516
Let's go, the van
is just right over there.

31:16.550 --> 31:19.152
You see it? Let's go.

31:22.222 --> 31:25.024
Come on, okay, go, go, go, come on.

31:25.058 --> 31:27.460
Come on, come on.

31:31.265 --> 31:34.367
- What do I do?
- Drive, drive!

31:36.503 --> 31:37.921
Stay down.

31:39.339 --> 31:42.008
Go, go, go!

31:44.445 --> 31:47.180
Stay down, down!

32:03.301 --> 32:05.369
We made it, girls! We're safe!

32:05.404 --> 32:08.205
Yay!

32:20.585 --> 32:23.758
There's the border. We made it, girls.

32:26.191 --> 32:28.793
Okay, come on out, come on out.

32:28.827 --> 32:31.016
Here we go, good job.

32:32.097 --> 32:33.731
Here we go, guys.

32:33.765 --> 32:36.600
There we go, good job.

32:39.004 --> 32:40.504
We pulled it off.

32:40.539 --> 32:43.240
It was even better
than the first time around.

32:43.275 --> 32:45.443
So what happens now?

32:47.179 --> 32:48.700
They cross.

32:49.114 --> 32:52.537
They find people they know.
People from their town.

32:52.984 --> 32:54.873
But, I mean, um...

32:55.901 --> 32:58.251
What happens to them?

33:05.030 --> 33:06.760
You don't know.

33:07.279 --> 33:09.214
I tried to search for them.

33:09.334 --> 33:11.702
For years, I tried, but...

33:11.736 --> 33:15.013
Between the refugee camps
and the foster homes,

33:15.047 --> 33:16.561
I lost them.

33:17.075 --> 33:20.523
This moment, right here,

33:21.480 --> 33:23.902
was the last time I ever saw them.

33:29.688 --> 33:32.452
I know I'm supposed
to say good-bye, but...

33:34.025 --> 33:35.622
I can't.

33:37.362 --> 33:39.463
I'm sorry, Mara.

33:39.498 --> 33:41.336
Girls.

33:41.933 --> 33:44.756
Come on. Let's go.

33:45.437 --> 33:49.511
But you know what'll happen
if you stay here, right?

33:51.176 --> 33:53.723
When you get to my age, you realize

33:54.112 --> 33:56.013
there are things
that are worse than death.

33:56.047 --> 34:00.150
Okay, yes, yes, you're right.
You can stay here.

34:00.185 --> 34:03.821
And you can just
let your body wither away.

34:03.855 --> 34:06.111
But deep down, you know the truth.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.155
These are not the girls that you loved.

34:10.128 --> 34:11.491
These are just...

34:12.030 --> 34:13.618
They're digital ghosts.

34:14.199 --> 34:16.667
They're echoes of real memories.

34:16.701 --> 34:21.000
You said it yourself, you want
to feel like you have purpose.

34:21.806 --> 34:25.295
Pilar, I believe that you still can.

34:26.143 --> 34:27.757
Out there.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.677
And think about the real girls.

34:31.315 --> 34:34.097
Is this what they
would have wanted for you?

34:58.577 --> 35:00.878
Ciao, mis amores.

35:03.782 --> 35:05.549
Elvia.

35:09.921 --> 35:11.593
Adios.

35:13.992 --> 35:15.597
Go to the border.

35:16.194 --> 35:18.057
Gracias.

35:34.045 --> 35:35.909
Exitus.

36:11.483 --> 36:15.619
- You were so brave.
- Are you kidding?

36:15.654 --> 36:17.321
You busted through that barricade

36:17.355 --> 36:18.989
like a bat out of hell.

36:19.024 --> 36:21.792
I don't know too many people
with the guts to pull that off.

36:21.826 --> 36:24.499
I told you, I'd do
anything for those girls.

36:25.697 --> 36:26.964
Well...

36:26.998 --> 36:30.534
I got to say good-bye to them this time.

36:30.568 --> 36:33.737
It's more than I could ever ask for.

36:33.772 --> 36:35.760
I don't know about that.

36:36.374 --> 36:39.510
- What do you mean?
- Charlie?

36:41.466 --> 36:42.892
Hello.

36:43.989 --> 36:45.723
Hello.

36:46.017 --> 36:49.119
Pilar, this is an old friend of yours.

37:07.887 --> 37:09.919
Elvia.

37:10.542 --> 37:12.276
Hello, Ms. Pilar.

37:12.310 --> 37:15.045
Elvia.

37:16.781 --> 37:19.627
I thought I'd never see you again.

37:19.661 --> 37:21.552
I thought...

37:24.903 --> 37:27.478
It is you, isn't it?

37:28.567 --> 37:30.634
You've gotten so old.

37:31.730 --> 37:34.785
Well, that's what happens after 45 years.

37:37.168 --> 37:39.240
How did you do this?

37:40.405 --> 37:42.639
This is my friend, Charlie.

37:42.674 --> 37:47.244
He's the one who found Elvia,
and the others.

37:47.278 --> 37:49.834
- The others.
- Mm-hmm.

37:53.818 --> 37:56.420
And who is this young lady?

37:56.454 --> 37:58.655
This is my granddaughter.

37:58.690 --> 38:00.457
Her name is Pilar.

38:00.492 --> 38:03.060
We brought something to show you.

38:05.497 --> 38:07.798
Ooh, thank you.

38:07.832 --> 38:12.069
- Oh, this is your family.
- They wanted me to thank you.

38:12.482 --> 38:14.071
For what?

38:14.105 --> 38:16.152
Ms. Pilar.

38:16.941 --> 38:19.302
I wouldn't be here without you,

38:19.337 --> 38:21.616
which means they wouldn't be here either.

38:22.380 --> 38:26.583
All these people,
children, grandchildren.

38:26.618 --> 38:28.619
They're all here because of you.

38:45.970 --> 38:49.606
- Everything set your end?
- Sure.

38:49.641 --> 38:51.689
You're sure you understand
what you have to do?

38:51.723 --> 38:54.232
I think so. It's not complicated.

38:55.680 --> 38:58.382
Good, I'll get the money to you after.

38:58.416 --> 38:59.983
20,000 cash.

39:00.018 --> 39:03.687
- Sounds right to me.
- See you then.

39:33.685 --> 39:36.153
Apertus.

39:52.203 --> 39:54.271
Sorry.

39:54.305 --> 39:57.174
Oh, my God, you scared me.

39:57.208 --> 39:58.609
Sorry.

39:58.643 --> 40:00.798
How did you get in?

40:03.114 --> 40:05.553
You never asked for it back.
I took it as a sign of...

40:06.918 --> 40:08.351
Oh.

40:08.376 --> 40:09.929
- For 18 months?
- Yeah, well, you know...

40:09.954 --> 40:11.622
- Oh yeah.
- I'm a very hopeful person.

40:11.656 --> 40:13.857
Oh, really, are you now?

40:13.892 --> 40:16.860
I'm so sorry I was late. Oh, my God.

40:16.895 --> 40:19.463
- It was just such a crazy day.
- Good crazy or bad crazy?

40:19.497 --> 40:21.798
Uh, you know what, I will
tell you in just one second.

40:21.833 --> 40:23.767
But first, I'm starving.
Are you ready for the pasta?

40:23.801 --> 40:26.069
- Mmm, sure.
- Okay, good.

40:31.910 --> 40:34.562
- Yes?
- Are you calling me?

40:34.596 --> 40:37.043
Mmm, no.

40:38.182 --> 40:40.183
This is you.

40:50.461 --> 40:53.096
- Hello?
- Mara.

40:56.701 --> 40:59.069
- Who is this?
- It's me, Chris.

40:59.103 --> 41:02.005
Sorry, I was in session
with patients all day.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.802
I just got your message.
Uh, I saw your text.

41:04.836 --> 41:07.002
Um, dinner.

41:07.036 --> 41:08.866
What do you mean?

41:09.380 --> 41:11.452
Did you send this to the wrong person?

41:12.984 --> 41:14.664
No.

41:15.620 --> 41:17.587
Who is this, seriously?

41:17.622 --> 41:20.044
Mara, it's me. It's Chris.

41:20.692 --> 41:22.890
Mara, are you there?

41:22.924 --> 41:25.329
I'm here, I'm here.

41:25.363 --> 41:28.928
When... when was the last time that...

41:29.968 --> 41:31.806
that we saw each other?

41:32.804 --> 41:35.105
What is going on? Is everything okay?

41:35.139 --> 41:37.808
No Chris, please...
please answer the question.

41:37.842 --> 41:39.676
When was the last time
that we saw each other?

41:39.711 --> 41:41.745
Three days ago, why?

41:45.663 --> 41:48.518
Mara, Mara, what's happening?

41:48.553 --> 41:49.987
Mara, what's happening?

41:50.021 --> 41:52.789
- You're not real.
- Mara?

41:52.824 --> 41:56.126
- You're not real.
- Just calm down.

41:56.160 --> 41:58.161
And everything's going to be...

42:01.699 --> 42:03.467
I'm here for a reason, Mara.
