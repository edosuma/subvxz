WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:09.092
-(bark)
-(easy listening music)

00:09.175 --> 00:10.510
He looked so sad
in the store,

00:10.593 --> 00:13.179
but now he just looks
kind of pissed.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.307
Hm...

00:16.391 --> 00:19.978
I know it's bad to emotionally
impulse-buy a living creature,

00:20.061 --> 00:23.064
-but I just--
-Yeah, I don't condone that.

00:23.148 --> 00:25.692
Uh, those are sterile,
so if you could just not...

00:25.775 --> 00:27.068
-Oh, sorry.
-(replaces lid)

00:28.445 --> 00:31.156
A dog. I should've just
gotten a mani-pedi.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.909
Hey, I dug out my old flute.

00:34.993 --> 00:38.204
I'm working on a song
for choir practice.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.999
It's not gonna be great
but, you know...

00:43.251 --> 00:45.670
-Joel?
-Yeah.

00:47.172 --> 00:50.800
You know,
you don't have to keep him.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.469
But that'd be really terrible.

00:52.552 --> 00:56.014
Take a breath. It's not
like a character judgment.

00:56.097 --> 00:59.100
You just seem like maybe
it's not the right time,
that's all.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.977
If you could foster
for a couple of days,

01:01.060 --> 01:02.520
I'll work on
finding a good home

01:02.604 --> 01:04.856
for this little guy. Okay?

01:04.939 --> 01:07.692
-Okay, I think... Yeah.
-(barking outside)

01:07.776 --> 01:09.611
-Thank you, Tiffani.
-Yeah, no doubt.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.321
(growling)

01:11.404 --> 01:13.156
-Oh god, he hates me.
-Well,

01:13.239 --> 01:15.158
why don't you try smiling
for the little guy?

01:16.159 --> 01:17.535
(dog growls)

01:18.244 --> 01:19.454
Well, not like that!

01:19.537 --> 01:21.873
(bark, growl)

01:21.956 --> 01:25.126
(light theme playing)

01:26.920 --> 01:29.756
-(street chatter)
-(birds chirping)

01:29.839 --> 01:32.967
(cafe chatter)

01:34.469 --> 01:35.470
Hey, Sammy!

01:36.513 --> 01:38.473
-(phone alerts buzzing)
-Oh.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.517
-Hey, how are you?
-Good.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.186
-Fred: Jesus.
-(alerts continue)

01:43.269 --> 01:45.021
I can tell you,
as a man of science,

01:45.104 --> 01:47.357
-meteorologists are
a bunch of ding-dongs.
-(laughs)

01:49.859 --> 01:51.194
Fred, can I ask
you somethin'?

01:51.277 --> 01:52.862
Sure.

01:54.113 --> 01:55.365
You ever feel judged?

01:55.448 --> 01:56.658
In fact, I do,

01:56.741 --> 01:58.493
but we don't have that
kind of time right now.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.869
Why do you ask?

01:59.953 --> 02:02.080
-I don't wanna bore you.
-Ah, bore me.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.082
Sam:
Hm...

02:04.999 --> 02:06.167
(inhales)

02:06.251 --> 02:07.752
(sighs) It's just, my...

02:07.836 --> 02:11.089
My sister and her friends
are all like faith and family

02:11.172 --> 02:13.383
and faith and family
and faith and family,

02:13.466 --> 02:16.302
and they're so judgmental
about my life, right?

02:16.386 --> 02:18.388
But my sister has actually
convinced herself

02:18.471 --> 02:20.682
-that she's only ever slept
with her husband, Rick.
-Mm-hmm.

02:20.765 --> 02:24.477
But by my count, she is skipping
over at least a dozen names.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.646
-But the real kicker
-(laughs) Yeah?

02:26.729 --> 02:29.149
is that her faith and family
best friend Charity

02:29.232 --> 02:31.234
is sucking my sister's
husband's dick.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.735
-Woo! (laughs)
-Are you following?

02:32.819 --> 02:35.113
I follow.
And this is not boring.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.407
But the problem is,
like, if I tell her,

02:37.490 --> 02:39.325
then I'm the asshole that
broke up her marriage, right?

02:39.409 --> 02:42.495
And if I don't say anything,
I mean... I can't win, right?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.582
She is a bitch,

02:45.665 --> 02:47.584
but she's also my sister.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.210
Just fuck.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.630
Sam, you gotta tell her.

02:53.548 --> 02:57.010
(exhales) Yeah...

02:57.093 --> 02:59.721
Would you wanna
know if it was you?

02:59.804 --> 03:00.930
Yes.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.015
Hey...

03:03.182 --> 03:04.517
You know what?

03:06.895 --> 03:09.397
Why don't you try
this for strength?

03:09.480 --> 03:11.941
You just pulled that
out of your pants?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.152
Don't worry about it.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.821
A Pretzel Schmetzel dog?

03:16.905 --> 03:20.199
You know that these just lay
around on the counter all day

03:20.283 --> 03:21.618
-in the temperature danger zone.
-Alright,

03:21.701 --> 03:23.161
you have a good point,
but I wanna tell you

03:23.244 --> 03:25.330
these defy the laws
of food science.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.916
And sometimes, you gotta
roll the dice for flavor.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.584
-(Sam sighs)
-(paper crinkling)

03:29.667 --> 03:31.210
Go ahead!

03:32.128 --> 03:33.296
(sniffs)

03:33.379 --> 03:34.589
I know it smells
a little funny,

03:34.672 --> 03:35.965
-but it's gonna
make you feel great.
-No.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.801
-It smells delicious.
-Alright, well, get in there.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.303
I'm not putting this
in my mouth right now.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.598
Just like your friend's sister
or your sister's friend.

03:43.681 --> 03:47.185
-I wasn't totally following.
There's just so much going on.
-(laughs)

03:47.268 --> 03:48.811
Thanks for listening, Fred.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.647
I really didn't have a choice.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.065
(laughs)

03:52.148 --> 03:55.485
Joel:
Okay, okay. Come on,
come on, come on, come on.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.779
We can do this.
We just gotta get home.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.198
-(phone alert blaring)
-(dog whining)

04:00.281 --> 04:01.532
Yeah, I know, I know.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.242
-(whines)
-No, no, no, no, no.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.453
I know that face.
Please don't do it
on the seat again

04:05.536 --> 04:09.248
-'cause that took
so many paper towels.
-(whines)

04:09.332 --> 04:11.292
(sighs) Can't you just
hold it until we get home?

04:11.376 --> 04:14.462
-It's a freaking tornado watch.
-(whines)

04:14.545 --> 04:17.006
Okay, what is it,
teetee or papaw?

04:17.090 --> 04:19.050
(thunder rumbling)

04:19.133 --> 04:21.761
(birds chirping)

04:21.844 --> 04:23.513
-(rustling)
-(grunts)

04:26.015 --> 04:27.767
-Sam: Hey.
-Hey!

04:27.850 --> 04:30.186
Sorry, I'm late.
I was gonna text,
and then I didn't.

04:30.269 --> 04:33.481
Oh, no, no worries.
I've actually gotten
a ton done.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.275
(sighs)
I'm not even saying that
passive-aggressively either.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.570
Been on a roll. I fixed
that leak on the combine.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.197
-Wow.
-Yup!

04:41.281 --> 04:43.366
And now, I'm just getting
all this cleared out.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.411
-(glass clinking)
-So, where there's--
(sighs, laughs)

04:46.494 --> 04:49.497
-Alright, Mom. (laughs)
-Sam: Oh. (laughs)

04:49.580 --> 04:51.207
-More hidden treasures.
-(sloshing)

04:51.290 --> 04:53.710
-We could open a bar, huh?
-I know, right?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.128
(bottle clatters)

04:55.211 --> 04:57.422
You know, we should probably
do a clean sweep of the house

04:57.505 --> 04:59.090
before she gets back.

04:59.173 --> 05:00.550
Yeah, good idea.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.637
I thought Crazy Dayz
was pretty cool.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.557
-I-I thought you did
a really good job.
-Thanks.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.685
You know, Rick was actually
really helpful, which...

05:10.768 --> 05:14.188
(sighs) I've not been
very nice to him.
Have to be nicer.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.483
-Honestly.
-No, you don't.
You're too nice to that guy.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.776
(laughs)

05:18.860 --> 05:20.319
That's something
I literally never thought

05:20.403 --> 05:21.404
I'd hear you say.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.990
(wind blowing)

05:24.073 --> 05:25.742
What?
What's wrong?

05:27.660 --> 05:29.078
-(phone buzzing)
-Hold on.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.832
-Oh, it's Shannon.
-(answers, typing)

05:32.915 --> 05:34.167
-(window shatters)
-(both scream)

05:34.250 --> 05:35.585
Sam: Are you okay?
I'll close the door.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.128
Shut the door!
Just shut the doors!

05:37.211 --> 05:40.173
(wind howling)

05:40.256 --> 05:41.799
(creaking, bangs)

05:41.883 --> 05:45.136
(wind blowing)

05:45.219 --> 05:47.263
Okay. Go ahead.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.265
-Can you hurry up
your business?
-(whining)

05:49.348 --> 05:51.726
Can you do it quick because...

05:51.809 --> 05:53.352
Okay, if that spot doesn't work,

05:53.436 --> 05:55.229
-how about this one?
-(thunder rumbling)

05:55.313 --> 05:58.483
Make a teetee here. This is
a good spot right here, huh?

05:58.566 --> 06:01.277
-Go ahead. Make your teetees...
-(thunder grows louder)

06:01.360 --> 06:03.488
-(barking)
-...over there?

06:03.571 --> 06:07.325
-Wait, dog! No, come back!
Come back, dog!
-(barking)

06:09.452 --> 06:11.245
-(wind howling)
-Tricia: Alright, Shannon.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.206
Okay, I'll let you go.
Just let her know

06:13.289 --> 06:16.417
that she can call me
anytime she wants to, okay?

06:16.501 --> 06:20.338
Alright.
Okay, love you. Alright.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.176
Okay. Well, so Shannon's safe
in her friend's basement.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.762
Um, Dad's at his PT.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.722
Rick is not answering
his calls though.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.434
(wind blowing)

06:33.518 --> 06:35.478
Why are you being so weird?

06:35.561 --> 06:36.813
Are you scared?
I mean,

06:36.896 --> 06:38.731
you know this tornado is
not gonna hit this barn.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.024
The odds are, like...

06:40.108 --> 06:41.692
No.

06:42.819 --> 06:43.945
(sighs)

06:45.571 --> 06:48.157
(wind blowing)

06:48.241 --> 06:50.785
-What?
-Rick is cheating on you.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.789
-(thunder rumbling)
-(sighs) What are
you talking about?

06:54.872 --> 06:57.250
Rick is cheating on you.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.669
(thunder cracking)

07:02.630 --> 07:05.800
-(hailing)
-(pained grunts)

07:08.594 --> 07:10.638
-(thunder continues)
-Shit! Shit! Shit!

07:10.721 --> 07:12.890
(hail clattering)

07:12.974 --> 07:14.350
Fucking dog!

07:14.433 --> 07:17.145
Literally running
around in a hailstorm!

07:19.272 --> 07:21.524
Fuck. (sighs)

07:25.153 --> 07:28.573
Dog! I'm coming for you!

07:32.994 --> 07:34.078
(grunts)

07:35.788 --> 07:37.415
I'm coming!

07:38.166 --> 07:39.750
Dog!

07:42.753 --> 07:44.088
Dog!

07:47.592 --> 07:49.635
(pained grunting)

07:49.719 --> 07:51.304
You know he's not
very talkative, right?

07:51.387 --> 07:53.389
So any time I would try to,
like, kinda ask or whatever,

07:53.472 --> 07:55.558
I wasn't getting anywhere.
So then,

07:55.641 --> 07:56.976
I decided to stalk him
just a little bit--

07:57.059 --> 07:59.896
Sam, what does any of this
have to do with cheating?

07:59.979 --> 08:01.063
Okay, let me skip ahead.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.857
I was at Mom and Dad's house.
I looked in his jacket,

08:02.940 --> 08:04.233
I found these two
cell phones. I'm like,

08:04.317 --> 08:06.027
-what the fuck is he doing?
-Samantha!

08:06.110 --> 08:07.653
(Sam sighs)

08:09.614 --> 08:11.115
(slaps legs)

08:11.199 --> 08:12.700
Tricia...

08:12.783 --> 08:14.660
-(wind blowing)
-(creaking)

08:14.744 --> 08:16.078
(sighs)

08:17.246 --> 08:19.248
I saw stuff.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.876
(sighs)

08:24.337 --> 08:26.631
(heavy breathing) Stuff?

08:26.714 --> 08:28.382
I mean, not sex,

08:28.466 --> 08:30.051
but stuff.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.098
-And you're sure?
-Oh, I wish I wasn't.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.684
(inhales)

08:40.561 --> 08:42.188
(quiet muttering)

08:44.398 --> 08:45.983
(sniffles)

08:47.777 --> 08:49.570
Well, I'm an idiot.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.948
-(sad laugh)
-You're not.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.824
(sighs)

08:53.908 --> 08:55.451
Who is it?

08:55.534 --> 08:56.911
(groans)

08:56.994 --> 08:59.455
We've already...
I've given you
a lot to process.

08:59.538 --> 09:02.667
I think maybe we should just
save that for another time.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.543
Who is it?

09:04.627 --> 09:07.755
(wind blowing)

09:08.548 --> 09:09.966
It's Charity.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.222
-I'm sorry.
-(gags)

09:19.183 --> 09:21.310
-(louder gag)
-Oh, oh...

09:21.394 --> 09:23.521
(retching)

09:23.604 --> 09:26.649
(retching, coughing)

09:26.732 --> 09:28.192
(vomits)

09:28.276 --> 09:30.486
Oh my god, Sa-- (retch)

09:30.569 --> 09:32.655
You know I can't not throw up
if I see you throw up!

09:32.738 --> 09:35.574
-(both retch)
-But I didn't even throw up!

09:35.658 --> 09:37.868
-(Tricia retching)
-Oh...

09:37.952 --> 09:39.453
-Oh my god, what did you eat?
-Oh...

09:39.537 --> 09:41.914
Oh, one of those Pretzel
Schmetzel fucking dogs...

09:41.998 --> 09:44.667
Oh... (retches)

09:44.750 --> 09:46.085
-Ew!
-(exhales)

09:46.168 --> 09:48.963
-Fred Rococo said
roll the dice.
-(gasping)

09:49.046 --> 09:50.464
-(thunder rumbling)
-Joel: Oh, I gotcha!

09:50.548 --> 09:54.468
-I gotcha!
I gotcha! I gotcha.
-(trees rustling)

09:54.552 --> 09:56.095
-(panting) Okay?
-(thunder rumbling)

09:56.178 --> 09:58.556
Oh, that's not good.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.599
Let's go here.
What's this thing?

10:00.683 --> 10:01.851
(wind picking up)

10:01.934 --> 10:04.603
-We're okay. We're okay.
-(wind howling)

10:04.687 --> 10:07.732
-You okay? We're okay.
-(thunder rumbling)

10:07.815 --> 10:10.651
(chirping, squeaking)

10:10.735 --> 10:13.321
Oh my god, there's
something else in here.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.490
-(squeaking continues)
-Oh, fuck me. Oh, fuck me.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.409
-Fuck me.
-(thunder rumbling)

10:18.492 --> 10:20.578
(wind howling)

10:20.661 --> 10:22.788
I cannot get rabies again.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.211
-(yelling gibberish)
-(squeaking continues)

10:29.295 --> 10:32.381
It's just a mouse.
It's just a mouse.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.592
-We're okay.
-(metal creaking)

10:34.675 --> 10:37.511
I mean, we're fucked,
but we're okay.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.765
(rattling)

10:40.848 --> 10:43.934
-(thunder cracking)
-(panting)

10:44.018 --> 10:45.061
(clank)

10:45.144 --> 10:48.314
(wind blowing)

10:48.397 --> 10:50.566
Part of you must just be
loving this right now.

10:50.649 --> 10:52.610
-What? No.
-This is, like,

10:52.693 --> 10:54.028
so hilarious to you.

10:54.111 --> 10:57.073
My whole life falling apart.
It being me this time.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.657
What do you mean
you this time? What--

10:58.741 --> 11:00.993
-Why are you doing this to me?
-I'm not doing anything!

11:01.077 --> 11:04.330
-I mean, you really just hate
me this much, don't you?
-Tricia, I don't--

11:04.413 --> 11:05.706
-You do!
-I don't hate you!

11:05.790 --> 11:08.584
Then how come you've nothing
better to do with your life

11:08.668 --> 11:11.462
-than to insert it into--
-Oh, Jesus Christ!

11:11.545 --> 11:14.799
What stuff did you see?
Did you see his stupid dick?

11:14.882 --> 11:16.926
Oh, god, no, gross!

11:19.178 --> 11:21.222
Who else have you told?

11:21.305 --> 11:23.057
Who am I gonna tell?
You're my sister.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.600
Like, I-I wasn't even
going to tell you!

11:24.683 --> 11:27.603
-Well, maybe you shouldn't have!
-Maybe I shouldn't have, right?

11:27.686 --> 11:28.854
Maybe I should let him keep on

11:28.938 --> 11:31.107
fucking around behind your back!
Would that be better?

11:32.066 --> 11:34.693
Oh god... (crying)

11:35.319 --> 11:36.904
(sobs)

11:38.489 --> 11:41.200
(sobs) I mean,
I should've known.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.244
-(gate opens)
-(sobs)

11:44.995 --> 11:46.664
-(bottles clink)
-(thunder rumbling)

11:46.747 --> 11:49.875
(Tricia crying)

11:52.795 --> 11:54.296
-(muttering)
-Try this.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.590
(sighs)

12:00.219 --> 12:01.554
(coughing)

12:01.637 --> 12:03.347
God! Mom... (sniffs)

12:03.431 --> 12:05.975
This vodka is so gross.
(coughs)

12:06.058 --> 12:08.644
(both cough)

12:08.727 --> 12:11.355
Oh god.
Well, that's wonderful.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.816
(both laugh)

12:13.899 --> 12:15.818
I think it just burnt
the flesh off my uvula.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.737
-(laughter)
-(thunder)

12:20.364 --> 12:22.700
My insides are rotting.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.870
(laughing)

12:26.537 --> 12:28.038
(sniffles)

12:29.999 --> 12:31.125
(sighs)

12:31.208 --> 12:33.711
(muffled laughter)

12:34.462 --> 12:35.504
(wheezes)

12:35.588 --> 12:37.506
(wind howling)

12:37.590 --> 12:41.385
It's okay. Calm down.
Calm down. There we go.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.846
Okay. I'm just gonna
eat a little something

12:43.929 --> 12:46.223
'cause I'm a little
light-headed.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.559
I forget to eat sometimes.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.896
(thunder cracking)

12:51.979 --> 12:54.482
This has chocolate.
I don't think you can eat that.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.318
Or is that cats?

12:57.401 --> 13:00.154
I'm gonna ask Tiffani.
If we live. (laughs)

13:00.237 --> 13:02.281
Just kidding,
we're totally gonna...
We're gonna be fine.

13:02.364 --> 13:06.160
-(wind continues)
-(metal creaking)

13:06.243 --> 13:08.496
Did you ever make
teetee or papaw?

13:08.579 --> 13:10.039
You must have, right?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.540
(laughs)

13:11.624 --> 13:14.168
Hey, I want you to know,
I'm not mad at you, alright?

13:14.251 --> 13:17.254
I know you were just scared.
Thunder's scary.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.133
I'm scared a lot, too.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.055
Ooh. You feel that?

13:26.138 --> 13:28.224
(wind quiets)

13:28.307 --> 13:32.102
God, the air pressure just
changed. Got goose-pimples.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.688
-(thunder rumbling)
-Oh.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.524
Okay. Alright.

13:37.316 --> 13:40.069
It's okay. You're okay.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.279
-Okay.
-(typing)

13:42.863 --> 13:45.199
(panting)

13:45.282 --> 13:48.619
Hey, babe. Or Michael.
Michael. Hi, hon. Babe.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.704
Um...

13:50.788 --> 13:52.706
Listen, uh,

13:52.790 --> 13:54.208
I hope your tournament
is going well.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.168
I'm sorry it's
really loud here,
but (clears throat)

13:56.252 --> 13:57.211
it's a tornado,

13:57.294 --> 13:59.547
and I'm in a little
tube thing. It's okay.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.091
Anyway, I just wanted
you to know that,

14:02.174 --> 14:03.384
(sighs) um,

14:03.467 --> 14:05.594
I actually do want kids.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.138
And, and a house
and a, a Vitamix

14:08.222 --> 14:10.474
and a Dyson and marriage.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.395
I just do.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.064
I love you.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.566
And I know
I told you this already,

14:18.649 --> 14:20.568
but it's, it's the Vitamix
that heats up,

14:20.651 --> 14:23.112
so you can make soup. Okay.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.823
This isn't a proposal!

14:28.033 --> 14:30.744
Okay. I think
we're okay, aren't we?

14:31.912 --> 14:33.914
Roger?

14:33.998 --> 14:37.209
Is that your name? Roger?
Do you like that name?

14:37.293 --> 14:40.254
I like it, too. Roger.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.006
-Tricia: That's it! (laughs)
-Sam: K-K-Katie!

14:42.089 --> 14:43.966
♪ Beautiful Katie ♪

14:44.049 --> 14:47.803
♪ You're the only
g-g-girl that I adore ♪

14:47.886 --> 14:51.557

-(laughter)
-Oh my god. Classic Mom.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.065
-(laughing)
-So bad...

15:00.149 --> 15:01.442
Oh, do you remember...

15:01.525 --> 15:03.110
Do you remember when
Holly was over there,

15:03.193 --> 15:04.445
singing
"Sentimental Journey,"

15:04.528 --> 15:06.739
and she started
pissing herself?

15:06.822 --> 15:09.491
(laughing)

15:09.575 --> 15:12.661
You were laughing so hard
that she just kept singing,

15:12.745 --> 15:14.330
-and kept pissing herself?
-Yeah!

15:14.413 --> 15:17.333
-(laughter)
-Oh, that's terrible.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.753
(laughter fades)

15:20.836 --> 15:23.505
-(Sam gasps)
-Hm...

15:23.589 --> 15:25.549
Wow, I really miss her.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.886
Yeah.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.472
You...

15:31.555 --> 15:34.850
You still wear
her necklace, huh?

15:34.933 --> 15:37.061
Yep. Every day. (sniffs)

15:38.646 --> 15:39.730
(sighs)

15:41.023 --> 15:43.567
(gasps) Oh my god!

15:44.276 --> 15:45.361
What?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.781
I just realized...

15:48.864 --> 15:51.325
this is why he's
been working out.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.035
Oh, gross!

15:53.118 --> 15:56.914
-(Sam laughs)
-This is so frickin'
embarrassing!

15:57.790 --> 15:59.375
(door opening)

15:59.458 --> 16:02.503
-(grunts) Someone's here...
-Ow. Sam! That's my hair-- Ow!

16:02.586 --> 16:05.547
-(hay rustling)
-Ow... Ah!

16:05.631 --> 16:06.924
Hello?

16:07.007 --> 16:09.259
-Oh, hey.
-Oh, hey!

16:09.343 --> 16:10.886
This is my dog, Roger.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.221
-Hey, Roger!
-Hey, Roger.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.722
-Did I hurt you?
-Mm-hmm.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.059
-(birds chirping)
-Come on, come on.
Pick up, you motherfucker.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.727
Joel:
So wait,

16:18.811 --> 16:21.230
Rick is a drug-dealing
adulterer?

16:21.313 --> 16:23.190
Just an adulterer.
I think the drug-dealing part

16:23.273 --> 16:25.484
-might not have been accurate.
-(laughs)

16:25.567 --> 16:27.277
But wait, what about
the big wad of cash?

16:27.361 --> 16:29.196
I think he just
saved up his allowance,

16:29.279 --> 16:31.740
so he didn't have to use
their credit card at the motel

16:31.824 --> 16:33.784
for the (whistling). Yeah...

16:33.867 --> 16:36.537
What a web of lies.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.955
(burps):
Yep.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.581
Oh...

16:39.665 --> 16:41.458
You ladies been drinkin'?

16:41.542 --> 16:43.460
-Don't worry about it.
-(laughs)

16:44.294 --> 16:46.714
Sam:
(gasps) Oh no!

16:46.797 --> 16:49.258
The cupola's gone!

16:49.341 --> 16:52.761
-Dad's gonna be so sad.
-He's not answering his phone!

16:52.845 --> 16:54.930
She's not answering her phone!

16:55.013 --> 16:57.766
He's not at work!
She's not at the store!

16:57.850 --> 16:58.976
They're together!

16:59.059 --> 17:01.729
Well if they are,
they don't have many options.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.440
-Here! Let's rock-and-roll!
-(keys jingling)

17:04.523 --> 17:06.525
-(laughs)
-We can take my car.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.318
I think that's best.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.238
-You're not drunk, are you?
-No!

17:11.321 --> 17:12.990
-Alright, good.
-I'm high on life.

17:13.073 --> 17:16.201
-(Sam laughs)
-I'm high on being a mother!

17:21.206 --> 17:24.835
Tricia:
Wh-why are we parking here?
Their cars aren't here.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.629
I never knew my daddy.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.965
(birds chirping)

17:30.048 --> 17:33.010
But Mom said he always
parked around back.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.386
Smart.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.060
(baby talk):
Where's she going, Roger?

17:44.813 --> 17:47.232
-(normal voice): Well,
she's doing it, isn't she?
-Joel: Mm.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.110
-Oh, there she goes.
-I look a little wild.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.113
Like, physically,
do you think?

17:53.197 --> 17:55.282
Yeah. I wasn't
gonna say anything,

17:55.365 --> 17:57.409
-but yeah...
-(laughs)

17:57.493 --> 17:59.787
Well, I was stuck in one of
those drainage pipe things

17:59.870 --> 18:01.246
-during a tornado.
-Oh my god!

18:01.330 --> 18:02.498
I'm sorry if
I got a little messy!

18:02.581 --> 18:05.209
-Like the little baby Jessica?
-(laughs)

18:05.292 --> 18:08.295
-No, I think she was
in a well, right?
-Oh shit.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.380
-Whoopsies, Roger.
-But we made it,

18:10.464 --> 18:13.008
didn't we?
We survived, huh, Roger?

18:13.091 --> 18:14.635
We weathered that
fucking storm.

18:14.718 --> 18:17.846
But you could have died,
Roger! You could have died!

18:17.930 --> 18:19.640
They're here!
They're fucking here!

18:19.723 --> 18:21.975
-Oh shit.
-Really? Oh.

18:22.059 --> 18:25.521
-(leaves crunching)
-(birds chirping)

18:25.604 --> 18:27.606
Sam:
Okay, and she's
taking off her shirt.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.900
Joel:
Wow, that's a bold choice.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.486
Oh, got a towel,

18:32.569 --> 18:35.531
walking around like she's
a burglar in a cartoon.

18:35.614 --> 18:39.076
-(plastic thudding)
-(ice dispensing)

18:39.159 --> 18:40.577
-Tricia: Hi!
-Housekeeper: Hey.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.871
-Sam: She's making friends.
-Tricia: How's it going?

18:42.955 --> 18:46.834
-Housekeeper: Fine, how are you?
-She's talking to a gentleman.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.044
Do you have one of those
universal key thingies...

18:49.127 --> 18:50.963
-Joel: Should we
do something?
-...I got locked out!

18:51.046 --> 18:52.548
Housekeeper:
We use real keys...

18:52.631 --> 18:54.383
Hey, about Pastor Deb.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.927
(chatter continues)

18:57.010 --> 19:00.138
-Mm-hmm.
-Tricia: My goddamn husband
got his dick stuck...

19:00.222 --> 19:03.267
-I know you feel bad, but...
-Tricia: ...with
my best friend...

19:03.350 --> 19:05.060
I'm glad you lied.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.729
-About choir practice.
-Tricia: They're right here.
They're right next door.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.314
Housekeeper:
I know, but I don't know...

19:09.398 --> 19:12.234
Just for your information.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.444
-Hey. I can't--
-Give me the keys!

19:14.528 --> 19:17.614
-Um, okay, we need
to go in there.
-Yes, immediately, right now.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.117
-Fuck this ice.
I want those keys, Weber.
-(ice clattering)

19:20.200 --> 19:22.327
-They're my keys.
You're not gonna-- Hey!
-Gimme the keys!

19:22.411 --> 19:24.454
-Weber, gimme the keys!
-This is my job! I'm not gonna--

19:24.538 --> 19:25.664
Tricia!

19:25.747 --> 19:27.124
Okay,
I'll tell you what.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.459
-For $50, I'll tell
you the room number.
-Yeah.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.628
-Weber: For $100,
I'll give you the key.
-Tricia: Done.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.381
-Sam, pay the guy.
-Uh, Joel, pay the guy.

19:34.464 --> 19:36.675
-Joel: What's your Venmo?
-My what?

19:37.718 --> 19:39.595
Oh, for God's sake.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.930
(sighs) I guess we're
just doing cash now?

19:46.310 --> 19:48.937
-Oh, Tricia, are you sure?
-Yep.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.316
-Oh fuck!
-What the heck, Rick!?

19:52.399 --> 19:54.735
You have two hours to get
home and get your crap,

19:54.818 --> 19:56.862
and you better not be
there when I get back!

19:56.945 --> 19:58.155

-Rick: I...

19:58.238 --> 19:59.907

-Who?

19:59.990 --> 20:01.366
You fucking know who!

20:19.301 --> 20:22.721
(Charity coughing, gasping)

20:34.191 --> 20:36.443
Y-you wanna stop
and get some ice cream?

20:49.915 --> 20:52.542
You want me
to come and sit
with you back there...

20:52.626 --> 20:55.170
-No.
-Okay.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.179
