00:06.006 --> 00:09.676
<i>Every being enjoys singing in the shower
or alone in their roll machine.</i>

00:09.676 --> 00:11.887
<i>I'm a dangerous being</i>

00:11.887 --> 00:15.641
<i>But performing in front of a big audience
can stir up other sensations,</i>

00:15.641 --> 00:17.643
<i>usually a delirious cycle of courage...</i>

00:17.643 --> 00:18.894
I can do this.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.479
<i>...extreme overconfidence...</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:22.397
Only I can do this.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.191
<i>...and self-consciousness.</i>

00:24.191 --> 00:25.108
I can't do this.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.027
<i>The thrill of going on stage</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:30.364
<i>is in knowing the performance could be
a spectacular success.</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:33.867
They love me!
They're standing and smacking their hands.

00:34.576 --> 00:36.286
<i>Or a spectacular failure</i>.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.205
This feels like perishing.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.792
<i>Performing for an audience is an emotional
risk that can end in disaster.</i>

00:42.626 --> 00:44.711
<i>But for those who are willing to
cast risk aside</i>

00:44.711 --> 00:46.964
<i>and showcase their vulnerability on stage,</i>

00:46.964 --> 00:49.716
<i>the possibility for
transcendent joy awaits.</i>

00:58.475 --> 01:01.228
<i>Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:03.021
<i>Orbiting a star</i>

01:03.772 --> 01:06.441
<i>We find ways to give life meaning</i>

01:06.441 --> 01:08.068
<i>Some might seem bizarre</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:11.280
<i>All we know is that we exist</i>

01:11.280 --> 01:14.241
<i>And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot tubes on</i>

01:14.241 --> 01:16.577
<i>Joy and sadness, courage and fear</i>

01:16.577 --> 01:19.246
<i>Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger</i>

01:19.246 --> 01:21.456
<i>And it's only getting stranger
From here</i>

01:39.183 --> 01:40.809
Wow! That's a melody.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.728
Are you a professional musician?

01:42.728 --> 01:45.772
No. Were you just waiting to terrify me?

01:45.772 --> 01:47.608
Sometimes I come here during the day

01:47.608 --> 01:50.444
and let the young beings bury me
in the sand.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.863
I find the weight of the sand soothing.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.573
Why are you playing music on the beach?

01:55.157 --> 01:58.243
It is one of the few places
I feel comfortable playing

01:58.243 --> 02:02.080
because I'm unable to perform
in front of other beings.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.250
Well, we both just learned
that isn't true. You're talented.

02:05.250 --> 02:09.338
Why don't you show off those chops
at my restaurant's annual talent show?

02:10.088 --> 02:12.883
If I consider it,
will you promise to stop lurking?

02:12.883 --> 02:18.096
Yes. But if you do see anyone lurking,
it's just a lurk-alike.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.687
Here's your order. I think.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.275
Love it. Cool to see you doing new things.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.903
Are you gonna show off
any hidden talents tonight?

02:33.570 --> 02:34.947
I'm a structural engineer.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.908
My talent is preventing your restaurant
from falling off the cliff.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.410
Tell jokes like that.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.829
It's my goal every revolution

02:42.829 --> 02:45.791
to get a new being
to share their gifts with us.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.335
I'm only helping set up
because you give me free breakfast.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.920
You'll come around some day.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.672
How come I don't get free breakfast?

02:55.467 --> 02:58.053
Why are they so adamant
about beings sharing their talents?

02:58.053 --> 02:59.638
They've been that way since I met them.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.682
They're incessantly trying to prove
I'm a juggler.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.183
You are.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.854
- See?
- So close.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.898
Maybe some beings don't have
a talent to share.

03:10.899 --> 03:15.863
Maybe. If you do have a talent,
it clearly isn't making banners.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.240
I think it's cute.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.120
Hey. There's my favorite lifegiver.

03:23.620 --> 03:25.289
Well, I'm your only lifegiver.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.166
Sorry. That came out
way darker than intended.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.127
I think they would've laughed at that
were they here.

03:30.127 --> 03:33.088
And as you pointed out,
they're not because they perished.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.340
Yikes. I am sorry to hear that.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.510
It has been many revolutions.
This is how we cope.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.761
No judgment here.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.974
I have been thinking about them
a lot recently

03:44.808 --> 03:46.810
and I feel like I owe it to them

03:46.810 --> 03:49.730
and to you
to try to perform for other beings.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.025
They always wanted you to.
I know they'd want you to try it again.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.485
They thought it would make beings happy.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.446
I wouldn't want to
let you both down again.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.824
I did get this invitation to perform
at a talent show though.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.451
Do you think it's a sign?

04:02.451 --> 04:04.953
Where exactly did
this invitation come from?

04:04.953 --> 04:07.748
A sand creeper emerged out of the beach
and handed it to me.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.959
That's probably as much of a sign
as you're ever gonna get.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.798
You're going to overload the whole system
if you do it that way.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.636
Don't tell me how to manage
my own restaurant's stage lights.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.974
Don't worry. I'll fix the mess you made.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.434
I wasn't worried.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.855
Put that there. That's wrong.
Now correct it and that's also wrong.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.899
And, there. This is how you do it.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.651
That looks precarious.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.406
I hope that free breakfast was worth
ruining the show.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.284
If you hadn't averted the power wrong,
this would've never happened.

04:44.284 --> 04:48.455
It looks like your lack of teamwork
plunged our talent show in the darkness.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.582
I'll need you both
to fix this immediately.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.084
- I was fixing the mistake.
- They redid my wiring.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.545
Either you work together
or you work somewhere else.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.547
You're both talented beings.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.798
You'll figure it out.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.008
Management is my identity.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.176
I don't work here.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.971
That's true.
I can always have you reassigned.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.807
No. The mystery of
the crevasse gives me purpose.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.350
Lots to unpack.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.519
- My Lorb. I can't work like this.
- Always a struggle.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.651
How are we gonna do the talent show
if we don't have power?

05:17.651 --> 05:20.654
No problem. We can turn on
the backup generator in my house.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.116
There's a backup generator? Why'd you
send them off to fix the main circuit?

05:24.116 --> 05:26.285
Well, it has to get fixed eventually.

05:26.285 --> 05:29.371
And it's a great opportunity for them
to learn to work together.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.415
Are they the right beings for that?

05:31.415 --> 05:32.666
We'll find out.

05:50.642 --> 05:53.729
- You took my advice!
- Please, stop doing that.

05:53.729 --> 05:57.900
I'm so glad you'll be sharing your talent.
What's the name of your act?

05:57.900 --> 05:59.067
I'm not sure yet.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.862
Interesting name,
but I like its relatability.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.447
No, I mean, I'm--

06:06.950 --> 06:10.078
You know, some beings around here
refer to me as the guide.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.081
I know I come on a little strong,
but given the opportunity,

06:13.081 --> 06:15.501
I do like to push a being
in the right direction.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.127
Hopefully, it's not off this cliff.

06:18.253 --> 06:20.130
I do need a push, don't I?

06:20.130 --> 06:23.425
We all do from time to time.
Let's get started.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.803
I didn't even know this room existed.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.889
I've seen it on some blueprints before.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.307
Of course you have.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.060
Apologies. I know much more about
this place than you do.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.521
Unhelpful, but technically true.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.024
This seems promising.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.527
Good.
I look forward to accomplishing this task.

06:41.527 --> 06:44.571
It's mutual.
This device seems to be in working order.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.406
We must follow the line to its source.

06:49.660 --> 06:50.827
Gratitude for finally helping.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.456
Must I remind you it was your help
that landed us in this situation?

06:57.918 --> 07:00.587
What's with this place and dark crevasses?

07:01.213 --> 07:03.549
- Let's get this over with.
- This wasn't on the blueprints.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.300
- You coming?
- I'm intrigued.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.137
I'm calling deception. You're scared.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.975
Deception called. My job is to
help avoid danger, not embrace it.

07:12.975 --> 07:15.435
If I can venture into this abyss,
you can too.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.274
All right.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.820
Okay, I can do this.

07:25.863 --> 07:26.864
Dingus.

07:33.912 --> 07:34.955
What are we doing here?

07:34.955 --> 07:38.458
I'm giving you the needed push
to perform on stage tonight

07:38.458 --> 07:41.211
by sharpening some necessary skills.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.256
The tasks that follow
will teach you those skills required

07:44.256 --> 07:46.008
to perform for a crowd.

07:46.008 --> 07:52.598
First, you must spray all of these plates
perfectly clean. No residue whatsoever.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.641
What does this have to do with performing?

07:54.641 --> 07:55.934
Everything!

07:58.437 --> 08:00.105
Less talk, more washing.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.191
I gotta plate this meal
before it overcooks.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.532
Wow. Free food.

08:12.993 --> 08:17.080
Focus on the food scraps. Be the sprayer.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.415
I don't understand.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.666
I don't either.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.589
Focus. Focus.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.977
A little too much spraying.

08:42.105 --> 08:46.360
Your second task is calling out
the customers' orders to the chef

08:46.360 --> 08:48.362
when the server drops them off.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.656
Impossible to mess this one up.

08:54.701 --> 08:58.163
I need a starch bowl
with cocoa slab on top-- Gross.

08:58.163 --> 09:02.334
Hey, we don't judge beings
for their strange consumption choices.

09:02.334 --> 09:03.752
Also, speak up.

09:04.586 --> 09:05.754
This is embarrassing.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.841
Embarrassment is
a building block of success.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.637
Leaf bucket. Hold the sauce.

09:13.637 --> 09:14.805
Really project.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.808
Make it sound like this being could perish
without their leaf bucket.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.894
Heat-blasted spud. Extra heat?

09:20.894 --> 09:24.314
Okay, that one is confusing to me too.
But nice job.

09:25.357 --> 09:30.320
<i>Noodle stack with layered stuff</i>

09:32.781 --> 09:35.951
Well, that descent was
as perilous as I expected.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.162
Stunning.

09:39.162 --> 09:42.833
They are, but admiring rocks isn't going
to get us back to Careful Now sooner.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.963
Strangely difficult
to lift off the ground.

09:48.714 --> 09:51.425
So small, yet so heavy. Curious.

09:56.722 --> 09:57.973
Watch out!

10:00.601 --> 10:03.687
I was right. I almost just perished.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.856
My blood pump is racing.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.858
That was terrifying!

10:07.858 --> 10:11.111
And it remains so
as it appears we can't go back that way.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.864
Then we must follow this power line
into the unknown.

10:14.489 --> 10:15.574
Or we will perish.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.832
I have never been more afraid, and yet
I feel more alive than I ever have.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.834
This is sad, but I agree.

10:25.834 --> 10:29.755
I would hope beings could feel they're
most alive without brushes with perishing.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.299
Does this mean we are unhappy?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.384
Maybe it's
because we were almost squashed,

10:34.384 --> 10:38.430
but I can admit that sometimes
I deceive myself about my feelings.

10:39.014 --> 10:41.600
Sometimes I feel as unstable as
the structures I study.

10:42.226 --> 10:44.895
Sometimes I feel like
I'm running through automated motions

10:44.895 --> 10:47.064
and not making decisions for myself.

10:47.064 --> 10:50.567
I always put the restaurant
and work before my own wants and needs.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.988
It's funny how we are raised
for candor with other beings

10:54.988 --> 10:57.407
but have difficulty being honest
with ourselves.

10:57.407 --> 11:01.745
It is. Beings evolved over generations
to prioritize honesty with other beings

11:01.745 --> 11:04.164
to the detriment of
their own self-honesty.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.916
What are your wants and needs?

11:06.458 --> 11:10.170
I'm not sure anymore,
but I know I don't feel fulfilled.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.593
It seems we've both
hit a wall in our lives.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.138
Walls are just floors
you have yet to learn to walk on.

11:21.890 --> 11:26.687
Your third task is to serve the orders
you took on the plates you just cleaned.

11:26.687 --> 11:29.857
However,
I won't be telling you who ordered what,

11:29.857 --> 11:34.653
so you'll have to sing the order to them
to find out. A performance of sorts.

11:34.653 --> 11:37.990
That's-- That seems like a stretch.
But I'll try.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.204
I have an order for...

11:47.249 --> 11:50.669
<i>Did someone get a starch bowl topped
With a cocoa slab?</i>

11:50.669 --> 11:52.796
- That one's not mine.
- I ordered that.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.173
<i>It's pretty gross</i>

11:54.173 --> 11:56.425
Don't slap it till you attempt it.

11:56.425 --> 11:59.428
<i>Okay, I've got some heat-blasted spuds
With extra heat</i>

11:59.428 --> 12:00.512
Now how does that work?

12:00.512 --> 12:01.638
<i>Not sure, beats me</i>

12:01.638 --> 12:03.891
That one was mine! Anybody wanna try?

12:03.891 --> 12:07.311
<i>Well, now I'm kinda tempted
Anybody order a--</i>

12:07.311 --> 12:08.228
Yummy leaf bucket?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.439
<i>Well, here you go, I hope you love it</i>

12:10.439 --> 12:11.440
Does this have sauce?

12:11.440 --> 12:13.066
<i>I double-checked, there's none</i>

12:13.066 --> 12:14.735
Thank you. I'm allergic.

12:18.989 --> 12:21.200
<i>And a noodle stack with layered stuff</i>

12:21.825 --> 12:24.661
Anybody? Please, speak up.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.413
That one's for me.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.040
It is? Thank Lorb.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.750
<i>Now I'm finally done!</i>

12:31.126 --> 12:31.960
You're ready.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.879
You really think
I can perform at the show?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.924
All I feel ready for
is working at Careful Now.

12:36.924 --> 12:41.053
Okay, look, I'd be deceiving you
if I didn't say we were short-staffed

12:41.053 --> 12:42.221
and needed the help today,

12:42.221 --> 12:45.933
but I do think this training
also prepared you for your performance.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.769
I guess I do feel a bit more confident
singing under pressure.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.730
You also aren't half bad
at cleaning plates.

12:51.730 --> 12:52.814
Could be half better.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.121
My Lorb, they're beautiful.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.249
You really have a thing for rocks, huh?

13:15.420 --> 13:16.672
Another dark crevasse.

13:18.215 --> 13:22.135
I'd hypothesize this is the work of
an intellectually superior being.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.929
Like outer-void beings?

13:23.929 --> 13:26.181
There's no proof
that outer-void beings exist.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.266
I like to think they do.

13:28.517 --> 13:32.354
This being-made machine must
convert energy from this gorgeous monolith

13:32.354 --> 13:33.772
and divert it to Careful Now.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.899
Okay, so how do we power it back on?

13:37.109 --> 13:39.111
It seems some of
the wires have been disconnected

13:39.111 --> 13:40.612
from their ports on the monolith.

13:41.113 --> 13:42.990
We should find a way to reattach them.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.491
This squiggly one goes here.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.959
How do we connect the last few?

13:53.959 --> 13:55.544
I can try to climb up there,

13:55.544 --> 13:57.713
but I don't think
I can do it holding the wires.

13:57.713 --> 13:58.964
Give me your foot tubes.

13:58.964 --> 14:02.342
I only take my foot tubes off
for the special beings in my life.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.678
Do you want to accomplish
this task or not?

14:08.891 --> 14:09.892
Here.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.852
And it's a safety harness?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.353
No.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.772
I thought your job is
to help avoid danger.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.525
I'm learning some danger is required
in my line of work.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.123
You're doing great.

14:45.928 --> 14:48.138
I got you. You've got this.

14:59.858 --> 15:03.278
- You did it!
- You saved me. Gratitude.

15:03.862 --> 15:04.905
I owed you one.

15:06.198 --> 15:07.908
That wasn't a machine, was it?

15:16.166 --> 15:20.420
I have a talent for tasting anything.
Give me something to taste.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.297
My foot tubes!

15:22.297 --> 15:23.549
I'll taste it.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.594
Really? Uh-uh.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.183
Salty.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.687
Tough act to follow.

15:36.687 --> 15:37.938
But you'll get through it.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.358
And if you don't, it's not like
there's anyone here to let down.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.110
You're on, friend.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.884
Oh, no.

16:06.884 --> 16:08.260
My ears!

16:09.887 --> 16:12.723
I can't do this.

16:15.893 --> 16:16.977
It's okay.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.729
You want me to taste your guitar?

16:20.022 --> 16:21.440
Let's get out of here.

16:21.940 --> 16:22.774
That's ominous.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.323
Okay, you were right. This is terrifying.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.826
It is. But we're discovering so much.
Like this map.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.579
Are you in shock?

16:35.579 --> 16:38.332
Maybe. But I think I found a way out.
Follow me.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.466
This map says there is another tunnel,
but I'm not seeing it.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.889
I guess walls truly are just floors
we have yet to learn to walk on.

16:55.224 --> 16:56.225
Oh, Lorb, this is wild.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.018
We'll have to be each other's support

16:58.018 --> 17:00.020
in order to properly
scale down that shaft.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.273
- I'm listening.
- Go back-to-back with me

17:04.273 --> 17:05.983
and interlock your arms with mine.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.654
We'll straddle the hole
then walk backwards one foot at a time

17:08.654 --> 17:11.198
using our backs for support
as we walk down the hole.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.578
Step harder.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.166
I've never felt more alive.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.295
Step.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.181
Apologies for pushing you to perform.

17:36.181 --> 17:40.519
My failure is not a reflection of
your kind and unorthodox teachings.

17:40.519 --> 17:42.187
I do like to nudge beings,

17:42.187 --> 17:45.357
but occasionally
I may push a little too hard.

17:45.858 --> 17:48.694
No. It is exactly what my partner
would have done.

17:49.319 --> 17:51.572
They wanted me to share my talent
with other beings.

17:52.322 --> 17:55.367
- Thought I could make them happy.
- That sounds like a wise partner.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.245
Well, they were. After they perished,

17:58.245 --> 18:01.582
I tried honoring their wish
by performing for my offspring's class.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.001
My offspring was so excited

18:04.001 --> 18:06.920
they told all their friends
how amazing I was going to be.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.589
I take it you weren't amazing?

18:08.589 --> 18:10.299
I made all the young beings cry.

18:10.299 --> 18:11.216
How?

18:11.216 --> 18:14.469
I sang the "creatures eating other
creatures eating other creatures" song.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.513
I was trying to be educational.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.433
You choosing that song makes you unique.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.435
I doubt another being
would have chosen it.

18:21.435 --> 18:24.688
It may have been slightly inappropriate
for the audience,

18:24.688 --> 18:26.440
but it did move them to tears.

18:27.191 --> 18:30.235
Look, I'm an old, scrappy, gorgeous being.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.237
I've seen a lot in my lifetime,

18:32.237 --> 18:35.741
and there is always one thing
that continues to surprise me.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.869
<i>How different each of us is
from one another.</i>

18:39.578 --> 18:43.874
<i>I put on this show every rotation to
celebrate the beauty in those differences.</i>

18:44.374 --> 18:47.503
<i>Every year I witness something
I've never seen before.</i>

18:48.003 --> 18:51.673
<i>And when I was buried in the sand
listening to your song,</i>

18:52.257 --> 18:56.762
<i>I felt like a leaf on the wind,
slowly dancing in the night.</i>

18:57.471 --> 18:59.681
Can't say I've ever felt that before.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.850
I wanted to catch that feeling in a bottle

19:01.850 --> 19:04.645
and share it with our friends
here at Careful Now.

19:04.645 --> 19:06.063
I hope you understand.

19:08.857 --> 19:12.569
I do. You helped me get closer to having
that ability to share.

19:13.278 --> 19:16.949
I want to try again.
It gets harder with each failed attempt.

19:16.949 --> 19:19.910
I let my partner and my offspring down,
and now I let you down.

19:19.910 --> 19:22.496
I just can't perform
in front of other beings.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.207
You've been performing for me
this whole time.

19:27.459 --> 19:28.544
I guess I have been.

19:28.544 --> 19:30.629
And for me too, buddy.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.590
Would you mind
taking this pep talk outside?

19:33.590 --> 19:34.675
My apologies.

19:34.675 --> 19:35.926
One second.

19:35.926 --> 19:38.554
It seems you're comfortable performing
around me.

19:38.554 --> 19:40.722
Perhaps I can assist you onstage,

19:40.722 --> 19:45.727
help you perform something that
transports the crowd to the outer void.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.272
What do you have in mind?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.901
- We're going to have to fall.
- Is it gonna hurt?

19:52.901 --> 19:54.403
Most likely, but we just have to do it.

19:54.403 --> 19:56.238
- Okay, one, two, three, go!
- Wait. I didn't agree to this!

19:58.323 --> 20:00.200
It is improbable
that we haven't perished yet.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.119
I don't know how much more I can take.

20:02.119 --> 20:03.787
Don't listen to that voice in your head.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.582
We've accomplished our task
and are going to get out of here.

20:06.582 --> 20:08.792
You and I. We've got this.

20:09.376 --> 20:14.006
Gratitude. I believe this unhelpful map
might show the exit this way.

20:19.344 --> 20:22.097
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

20:22.097 --> 20:26.643
Not many beings have. These could be
some of the earliest being drawings.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.270
I'll study these later.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.105
Amazing how far we've come.

20:30.105 --> 20:33.066
It is. We're almost home.
Let's keep moving.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.778
We made it.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.448
Today was terrifying but also fulfilling.

20:39.448 --> 20:41.074
It was, wasn't it?

20:41.992 --> 20:45.662
There is so much to discover out there.
Even about ourselves.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.332
Like proving you are more in control of
your life than you might think.

20:48.332 --> 20:50.751
Maybe only when faced with perishing.

20:51.919 --> 20:53.170
Shall we?

20:53.170 --> 20:55.839
Yeah. Let's go enjoy
the success of our adventure

20:55.839 --> 20:58.258
by watching beings
do strange things onstage.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.603
Amazing!

21:09.603 --> 21:11.688
- Thank you.
- That was awesome!

21:12.689 --> 21:15.067
Stunning performance, dear.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.151
You ready?

21:17.694 --> 21:19.488
I am.

21:19.488 --> 21:20.781
I know you are.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.492
- What?
- Just follow my lead.

21:23.492 --> 21:26.745
It is my great pleasure
to introduce your ears

21:26.745 --> 21:30.207
and your blood pumps
to my new friend's musical talent.

21:30.207 --> 21:34.044
Please welcome to the stage
I'm Not Sure Yet.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.295
When you're ready.

21:44.388 --> 21:48.392
<i>I never feel that good
When I perform in front of beings</i>

21:48.392 --> 21:51.895
<i>I work best for an audience of one</i>

21:52.855 --> 21:54.648
<i>The pressure makes
My blood pump flutter</i>

21:55.232 --> 21:59.945
<i>Ever since I lost my other half
I thought my music days were done</i>

22:01.363 --> 22:05.158
<i>Just because you're not here
Doesn't mean that you aren't with me</i>

22:05.659 --> 22:08.662
<i>Your voice
Will always be my guiding tone</i>

22:09.788 --> 22:13.709
<i>I'm playing loud so you can hear
Before the crowds I feel no fear</i>

22:13.709 --> 22:17.212
<i>'Cause I know I'm not doing it alone</i>

22:18.755 --> 22:21.049
- We love you!
- That was marvelous.

22:21.049 --> 22:23.135
- It was brilliant.
- Beautiful!

22:24.428 --> 22:26.388
I'm so proud of you.

22:26.388 --> 22:27.848
Thank you for believing in me.

22:27.848 --> 22:32.728
Other lifegiver would be proud of you too.
If they hadn't perished, of course.

22:32.728 --> 22:38.108
Okay. There are two more things you need
to do in order to complete your journey.

22:38.108 --> 22:41.987
You need to bus all the tables
and then clean the toilets.

22:41.987 --> 22:44.239
- I'm not doing that.
- Well, I had to try.

22:48.285 --> 22:49.620
So, did you fix the problem?

22:50.329 --> 22:54.291
What do you mean? Of course we did.
How else would this show be going on?

22:54.791 --> 22:56.376
We flipped on the backup generator.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.503
What?
