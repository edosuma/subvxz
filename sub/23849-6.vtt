WEBVTT

00:17.120 --> 00:18.440
<i>Previously on Berlin Babylon.</i>

00:18.520 --> 00:20.360
What do you know
about the gold on the train?

00:20.440 --> 00:21.800
I don't know anything.

00:22.480 --> 00:27.160
I don't know anything! Please, no!
Please, not back into the cold! No!

00:27.800 --> 00:29.200
<i>April 29.</i>

00:29.280 --> 00:32.600
<i>The cue "Prangertag" for a secret</i>
<i>operation is mentioned several times.</i>

00:32.840 --> 00:37.040
<i>We are hereby pressing charges</i>
<i>against the Reichwehr's general staff.</i>

00:37.400 --> 00:41.520
<i>A modern German shadow army</i>
<i>is being built here on a large scale.</i>

00:41.600 --> 00:45.320
<i>The Black Reichswehr is the biggest</i>
<i>threat to peace in Europe since 1918.</i>

00:45.400 --> 00:46.800
General Seegers, you're under arrest.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.240
<i>We have information that this</i>
<i>organization is preparing for a coup</i>

00:50.320 --> 00:52.480
<i>in the next days,</i>
<i>maybe right this moment.</i> Which one is this, Mr. Wolter? An M-28?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.960
This is something very special.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.120
With this we will be
writing history tomorrow.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.000
-Long live the Emperor!
-Long live the Emperor!

01:04.080 --> 01:07.000
Well then. Operation Prangertag.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.640
I'm about to be forced to release 15
high-ranking officers from custody.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.560
Even though the evidence is overwhelming.

01:13.640 --> 01:17.200
Do you know what you are doing?
You're messing with the state itself.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.720
Mr. Rath, I found this under your bed.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.120
-Fritz!
-Gretchen.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.240
-Let me go.
-We were ratted out.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.200
-Freeze!
-Gretchen, run!

01:29.680 --> 01:31.440
No! Fritz! No! They shot him!

01:49.600 --> 01:52.840
And remember, he's just an engineer,
not a military man.

01:53.800 --> 01:54.640
Him?

02:00.080 --> 02:03.760
If you're too tough on him,
he'll crawl back into his shell.

02:10.960 --> 02:11.880
That's him now.

03:25.560 --> 03:26.680
We didn't stand a chance.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.160
The car was gone as quickly
as it had appeared.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.760
-The man was dead on the spot.
-We'll investigate.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.360
Good morning, everyone.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.240
-And we meet again, Seegers.
-The little brother.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.040
Not the most desirable way to meet again,

03:44.120 --> 03:46.120
but duty is duty.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.120
Major General, you're on
the advisory board of the Nyssen Trust.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.520
In essence, what is your role?

03:52.040 --> 03:56.760
My attention focuses on maintaining
and preserving war monuments

03:56.840 --> 03:59.280
and on the care of officers' widows.

03:59.520 --> 04:02.120
This work binds you closely
to the Nyssen Group.

04:03.040 --> 04:04.600
Yes, you could say that.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.160
Is that why you used
Alfred Nyssen as a front

04:07.240 --> 04:10.400
for the Reichswehr
to import illegal weapons?

04:10.640 --> 04:12.560
Whom are you trying to impress?
Your brother?

04:13.000 --> 04:15.720
Answer the question. Is Nyssen your front?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.800
Like I already said, no.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.840
But Nyssen is the contracting entity

04:21.920 --> 04:25.360
for the delivery of goods
for which he has no use whatsoever.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.200
In contrast to the Reichswehr,
particularly your vision of it.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.840
-Poison gas.
-Vision.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.800
Isn't that something for novelists
or lunatics?

04:35.680 --> 04:37.680
But maybe you meant responsibility.

04:38.880 --> 04:39.720
What is it?

04:43.280 --> 04:45.320
This is the lifting of the arrest warrants

04:45.400 --> 04:48.080
against all ranks of the German Reichswehr

04:48.160 --> 04:50.360
who are in custody
because of Lipetsk and other things.

04:50.440 --> 04:51.760
IMPORT LICENSE

04:53.360 --> 04:54.440
Whose decision is this?

04:57.040 --> 04:58.160
Supreme authority?

04:58.240 --> 05:00.440
The gentlemen
are to be released without delay.

05:01.600 --> 05:02.600
Major General?

05:03.440 --> 05:04.280
Do you know this document?

05:05.840 --> 05:09.440
This is the confirmation of an order
of pesticides from the Soviet Union.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.560
According to the analysis however,
the wagons contain green cross.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.640
Green cross?

05:16.920 --> 05:19.160
It's the code name for pulmonary agents.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.920
Phosgene, diphosgene.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.560
I see your signature, Major General.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.560
Or am I mistaken?

05:29.960 --> 05:31.280
This is unbelievable.

05:37.000 --> 05:37.960
I don't believe this.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.360
Where did you unearth this, Rath?

05:43.440 --> 05:45.680
It literally flew into my arms.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.240
We'll go public with this.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.800
-We'll meet at Zörgiebel's office in ten.
-See you soon.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.920
-And?
-Nothing. No trace.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.400
I don't believe this.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.560
-What does her family say?
-No one is surprised.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.760
Miss Ritter often
doesn't come home at night.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.000
I gave her a clear task to do.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.680
She can't have disappeared.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.600
What about you?

06:08.680 --> 06:12.320
In those places where I know her
to be known, they haven't seen her.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.600
Thank you.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.800
Our kitchen is renowned
for its rich variety.

06:51.360 --> 06:55.680
You have a choice. Either you can make
a unique contribution, or you cooperate.

06:58.240 --> 06:59.080
I cooperate. Didn't hear you.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.520
I cooperate.

07:04.880 --> 07:05.720
Excellent.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.480
Tomorrow, 8 a.m., press conferenc<i>e.</i>
<i>Tabula ra</i>sa.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.080
Thank you, Miss Ackers.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.680
Good work, gentlemen.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.960
Of course you had a bit of luck, too.

07:46.680 --> 07:47.960
<i>-Yes?</i>
-Yes.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.800
I'd like to speak
with the President of the Reich.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.480
<i>-I'll put you through.</i>
-Thank you.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.080
What's the matter?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.360
I have to go.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.280
Yes.

08:45.480 --> 08:46.600
Does it still hurt?

08:57.000 --> 08:58.960
I've been so lucky to have you.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.480
No. Yes.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.320
Yes, I have.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.120
Definitely, Emmi.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.120
Right, duty calls.

09:31.520 --> 09:32.360
See you tonight.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.200
See you tonight.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.200
HOMEOPATHY

09:42.960 --> 09:44.880
CLOSED ON CORPUS CHRISTI
PROPRIETOR JOSEPH DÖHMANN

10:02.640 --> 10:06.440
The boss says you need to change
the application to intravenously.

10:07.760 --> 10:08.880
Where is Mr. Döhmann?

10:09.280 --> 10:10.280
Um, gone.

10:10.920 --> 10:11.760
I see.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.120
Do you know how it works?

10:16.320 --> 10:18.360
No, but my wife does. Thank you.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.680
Tell me.

10:50.200 --> 10:51.760
They gave me this at the hospital.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.320
He didn't make it.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.840
The bastards got him.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.320
It was the political police, Greta.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Your Benda here.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.680
FOR MY BELOVED SON FRITZ

11:14.560 --> 11:16.680
-What?
-The Jewish sow ordered this.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.680
The guys who shot down Fritz,
they were his men.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.120
Tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

11:45.040 --> 11:46.000
No matter what.

11:51.760 --> 11:52.680
We'll be in touch.

12:22.040 --> 12:22.880
Right.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.360
Flex it. Make a fist.

12:30.560 --> 12:33.320
Look, it's been more than ten years.

12:34.760 --> 12:36.720
I could start work
in any hospital tomorrow.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.040
Mull on it.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.160
Bend your arm.

12:44.080 --> 12:45.000
Very simple.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.240
Thank you.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.240
Stop. Service card.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.560
Pass.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.040
Schibulski, 11th precinct.

16:49.240 --> 16:53.600
I thought it was a bit over the top,
a room with a radio, but now I like it.

16:54.920 --> 16:59.200
Listen to the names of the districts,
Schöneberg. Beautiful.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.080
Charlottenburg...

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
If you had been a girl,
you'd be called Charlotte.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.480
But I'm not.

17:06.960 --> 17:07.800
Gereon.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.840
You're back.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.920
Tempelhof.
How do you like the sound of Tempelhof?

17:16.040 --> 17:17.200
Please bear with me.

17:18.840 --> 17:20.040
This stuff is strong.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.600
Yes. You must have been out for an hour.

17:24.880 --> 17:25.720
Really?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.880
<i>You will now hear a commentary</i>

17:30.960 --> 17:34.200
<i>on the visit of the French Foreign</i>
<i>Minister Aristide Briand...</i>

17:34.280 --> 17:35.560
What are you whistling?

17:36.200 --> 17:37.440
Mackie Messer. <i>The Franco-German...</i>

17:38.840 --> 17:40.160
Where did you get that from?

17:40.880 --> 17:41.720
Don't know. Everyone knows it.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.000
<i>Germany has been trying for a while</i>

17:46.080 --> 17:50.440
<i>to shed a different, more favorable</i>
<i>light on the nation of the arch enemy.</i>

17:51.560 --> 17:56.320
<i>So it is no surprise that the two model</i>
<i>foreign ministers of Germany and France,</i>

17:56.400 --> 17:57.840
<i>Stresemann and Briand,</i>

17:57.920 --> 18:02.560
<i>turn to a national-cultural phenomenon</i>
<i>today, on Prangertag,</i>

18:02.640 --> 18:07.000
<i>which almost singlehandedly restored</i>
<i>the world renown of the German theatre,</i>

18:07.080 --> 18:09.960
<i>after it had been deemed irrevocably lost:</i>

18:10.880 --> 18:12.600
<i>Brecht's Threepenny Opera.</i>

18:12.680 --> 18:15.600
<i>It's been running at</i>
<i>Theater am Schiffbauerdamm for a year now</i>

18:15.680 --> 18:20.560
<i>and will be knighted by a visit</i>
<i>of the two Nobel Peace prize laureates.</i>

18:21.280 --> 18:22.480
Prangertag, what's that? Corpus Christi.

18:26.560 --> 18:29.160
-That's...
-Today.

18:34.960 --> 18:35.800
I have to go.

18:36.800 --> 18:41.000
Minister Briand, how do you rate
the political situation in Germany?

18:41.280 --> 18:44.600
Young democracies are always in danger,

18:45.080 --> 18:47.240
but it's worth fighting for democracy.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.520
-Thank you.
-Monsieur Briand, this way.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.720
Well then, Heinrich.

19:10.920 --> 19:15.080
Ladies, gentlemen...
Here's to an entertaining evening.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.440
Yes, cheers.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.240
I have to admit, I haven't been
to the theater in a long time.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.880
To the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm,
quickly.

19:44.120 --> 19:44.960
Thank you.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.960
Can't you go faster?

21:16.520 --> 21:17.440
Service card.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.120
Pass.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.880
I'm sorry, mate.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.440
Security level one.
Only those on the list are allowed in.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.280
-Where is Councillor Benda?
-Upstairs.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.080
-With the ministers.
-Call him down.

21:43.160 --> 21:44.640
-What?
-Get him.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.560
Tell him, Inspector Rath
urgently needs to talk to him.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.280
-No one comes through here. Strict orders.
-I have to go in.

21:49.800 --> 21:53.440
But not today. You may be a big shot
outside, but you won't get in.

22:28.040 --> 22:30.680
<i>And the shark</i>

22:31.160 --> 22:33.520
<i>It has teeth</i>

22:34.000 --> 22:38.040
<i>And he wears them in the face</i>

22:38.840 --> 22:43.360
<i>And Macheath, he has a knife</i>

22:44.000 --> 22:48.680
<i>But the knife can't be seen</i>

24:11.360 --> 24:14.840
In order to counter the increasing
hardening of the people,

24:14.920 --> 24:20.000
businessman Jonathan Jeremiah Peachem
opened a shop

24:20.080 --> 24:22.360
where the most desperate of them all

24:22.440 --> 24:27.080
would get such a look that would speak
to those ever more obdurate hearts.

24:28.280 --> 24:30.400
Something new has to happen.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.640
My business is very tough,

24:32.720 --> 24:35.960
because it's my business
to incite human sympathy.

24:36.040 --> 24:39.640
There are but a few things
which shake people up,

24:39.960 --> 24:42.200
a very few things, but the bad thing is,

24:42.280 --> 24:45.040
that they don't work
if you use them several times.

24:45.680 --> 24:51.720
Man has the dreadful ability
to make himself callous at will.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.240
...another man...

24:59.320 --> 25:01.080
How much longer does this take?

25:01.640 --> 25:03.760
About one hour, Your Excellency.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.360
My God.

25:06.600 --> 25:10.040
...but the second time round
only five pennies.

25:10.120 --> 25:13.800
If he sees him a third time, he will hand
him over to the police in cold blood.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.200
Please don't! No!

25:54.720 --> 25:55.560
Stay calm.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.880
Put your gun down and get up.

26:06.080 --> 26:06.920
Are you alone?

26:47.040 --> 26:50.120
-Minister?
-Time for a little refreshment.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.360
-Certainly.
-An amusing play.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.000
Freeze!

27:21.120 --> 27:22.440
Did a man just pass by here?

27:23.360 --> 27:26.360
-With a bag?
-Yes, an officer has signed out.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.360
Stop! Halt!

27:33.520 --> 27:36.120
Right, stay right where you are.

27:44.520 --> 27:48.080
FRESHLY MILKED
WHOLE MILK

27:49.680 --> 27:50.680
Abort operation.

28:12.920 --> 28:14.600
The body of an assassin
is up on the gallery.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.320
Release the inspector immediately.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.800
-He's at stage right.
-Go on, you heard him.

28:25.400 --> 28:29.080
-Smith, what does he want from me?
-It's good that you waited for me...

28:29.160 --> 28:31.080
Here? Which side did he say?

28:31.160 --> 28:34.640
We want to take him in when we go to him

28:35.240 --> 28:39.200
so that he sees what kind of sentiment
we have against him.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.280
Good evening.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.720
I see you found your bearings.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.120
Please.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.040
Well, I'm listening.

30:30.560 --> 30:31.960
The train will be sent back.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.440
Including the wagon with the gold.

30:35.520 --> 30:37.760
-There is no gold in the wagon.
-There is.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.520
We personally checked.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.440
The wagon numbers were swapped.
You opened the wrong one.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.000
The gold is still in there.
They want to take it out

30:51.400 --> 30:54.400
on the way to Russia,
before the border, with a robbery.

30:54.560 --> 30:55.400
Who?

30:56.480 --> 30:58.080
Men of the Black Reichswehr.

30:58.600 --> 30:59.440
When? Tomorrow.

31:18.680 --> 31:19.920
Apart from Scheer and the second guy

31:20.000 --> 31:24.240
there must have been three or four more
of our men involved. Maybe even more.

31:24.920 --> 31:28.400
Our enemies have been everywhere,
even in the Castle, for a long time.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.040
I'm sure Scheer would have sung.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.320
He was executed, right in front of me.

31:35.800 --> 31:36.960
Do you suspect anyone?

31:39.000 --> 31:39.840
Wolter.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.680
He plays a decisive role
in this conspiracy.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.440
You are probably right.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.840
As you know,
we've been observing him for a while.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.880
But unfortunately
we had no evidence against him.

31:54.120 --> 31:54.960
Not yet. It's here.

32:08.680 --> 32:11.840
Do you realize that you've prevented
a coup d'état, Inspector?

32:14.920 --> 32:16.960
Most importantly,
Stresemann is alive.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.200
And tomorrow morning
we'll present Seegers to the press.

32:20.280 --> 32:21.880
We'll deal with Wolter after that.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.840
Get some rest, Inspector.
See you tomorrow.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.120
Good night.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.280
You can go.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.360
-Yes?
-Come on.

34:00.960 --> 34:03.560
I can imagine why Lotte
wanted to surprise me with this. -Yes? Why?
-Because it's my favorite food.

34:06.680 --> 34:10.000
And because I've never had it
for breakfast. And not so good.

34:11.440 --> 34:12.640
Yes, it is really good.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.760
I like watching our chef when he makes it.

34:17.200 --> 34:20.520
How he separates the yolk from the
egg white, how he whips the whites.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.040
Ten times to the left, ten times
to the right, and very, very fast.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.040
And we always have fresh raspberries
in our cold room.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.160
He'll heat them briefly with sugar,
for the red juice.

34:30.240 --> 34:32.600
-You have a cold room?
-Of course.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.920
-And always raspberries?
-Yes.

34:36.000 --> 34:36.840
Great.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.160
I've never eaten a <i>Berliner Luft </i>dessert
in such a posh restaurant.

34:47.640 --> 34:49.080
Your sister had a free wish.

34:51.040 --> 34:53.080
-Lotte.
-There you are.

34:54.240 --> 34:55.480
What a great surprise.

34:58.040 --> 34:59.680
Would you like to have a seat, miss?

35:00.440 --> 35:02.760
How... did you get here?

35:03.000 --> 35:06.840
They picked me up in a snazzy automobile.
What a show that was.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.720
And your friend here
entertained me very well.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.120
It was the best <i>Berliner Luft </i>ever.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.880
Tell me, what's your name?

35:21.880 --> 35:22.840
My name is Edgar.

35:24.120 --> 35:26.160
Right, we're off now.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.480
-Really?
-Yes.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.040
Alright.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.720
-Thank you, Edgar.
-My pleasure, Toni.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.480
-Come and visit me again, OK?
-Only if the automobile collects me.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.640
But of course. We've got your address.

36:04.720 --> 36:05.880
He's nice, right?

36:09.480 --> 36:10.320
Come on, let's run.

36:23.120 --> 36:25.640
RED CASTLE PRESS CONFERENCE
"REICHSWEHR"

36:26.880 --> 36:28.880
Gentlemen, please keep calm.

36:29.080 --> 36:31.280
You know the deal. You'll all get in.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.080
Gereon, how many have you got?

36:34.600 --> 36:35.640
The most important one.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.440
There is enough room for everyone.

36:49.880 --> 36:50.920
Welcome, Mr. Seegers.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.480
Even for you unpatriotic fellow,
it's still Major General.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.240
Lieutenant Colonel Benda, EK-1.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.720
Let's go, Seegers, the press is waiting.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.320
Here you are, thank you.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.760
Hello, Mr. Martin. Hi.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.000
Attention!

37:24.880 --> 37:27.720
We should start. The hall is packed.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.200
Very well. Let's go.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.000
Stop! Stop.

37:35.720 --> 37:36.880
Wait up.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.360
The President of the Reich,
Paul von Hindenburg is coming.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.640
-What?
-Yes.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.560
But I had no idea.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.480
No one announced this.

38:00.560 --> 38:01.520
Attention!

38:02.520 --> 38:06.280
His Excellency, the President of the Reich
Paul von Hindenburg.

38:07.400 --> 38:08.240
Stand to attention!

38:26.040 --> 38:27.160
Attention!

38:34.080 --> 38:37.000
Karl, how are the stocks?

38:37.880 --> 38:39.120
Mr. President.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.480
Benda. God be with you.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.400
Your Excellency.

38:46.920 --> 38:53.480
Well, let's bring some original
Prussian spirit to this matter.

38:54.080 --> 38:58.280
What I mean is common sense.

39:00.320 --> 39:01.160
Major General...

39:03.200 --> 39:04.320
You'll come with me.

39:08.800 --> 39:09.640
Gentlemen.

39:46.760 --> 39:51.120
Gentlemen, for investigative
and tactical reasons...

39:52.160 --> 39:54.120
in contrast to our previous announcement,

39:54.200 --> 39:58.280
we cannot make any new insights public
at the moment.

39:59.240 --> 40:02.320
The Chief of Police
is asking for your understanding

40:02.400 --> 40:06.720
that this press conference is to be
postponed until further notice. Thank you.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.960
I don't believe this!

40:19.720 --> 40:22.000
That beats everything. Unbelievable.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.520
Let them pass!

40:24.600 --> 40:26.160
Question: Why were you here?

40:26.720 --> 40:28.840
Why were you invited? One answer!

40:28.920 --> 40:31.160
-What's going on?
-Please wait.

40:31.240 --> 40:32.240
Make room!

40:33.080 --> 40:34.200
Let them pass!

40:38.280 --> 40:39.760
Just two questions, please.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.560
The President of the Reich has ordered

40:57.640 --> 41:00.440
that the train be sent back
to the Soviet Union at once.

41:02.680 --> 41:03.720
Without delay.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.240
Without further investigation.

41:12.280 --> 41:13.280
We lost.

41:36.120 --> 41:38.280
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

41:39.760 --> 41:41.600
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

41:43.400 --> 41:45.160
<i>But not yet now</i>

41:47.760 --> 41:50.600
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i>

41:54.240 --> 41:56.880
<i>Ocean of time</i>

41:58.400 --> 42:00.000
<i>Eternal law</i>

42:01.720 --> 42:04.000
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

42:05.440 --> 42:06.720
<i>To ashes</i>

42:07.240 --> 42:10.320
<i>To ashes, to dust</i>

42:10.800 --> 42:13.200
<i>Stolen from the light</i>

42:14.560 --> 42:16.920
<i>But not yet now</i>

42:18.840 --> 42:21.720
<i>Miracles wait until the end</i> <i>It must be just a dream</i>

42:37.400 --> 42:41.800
<i>Trying to snatch the wind</i>

42:42.120 --> 42:45.640
<i>Who really knows?</i>

42:48.400 --> 42:51.520
<i>The clock on your wall</i> <i>It is filled with sand</i>

42:55.760 --> 42:58.800
<i>Put your hand in mine</i>

42:59.320 --> 43:02.520
<i>And let us be forever</i> <i>Now you make your choice</i>

43:06.840 --> 43:11.120
<i>And throw us</i>
<i>in between happiness and agony</i>

43:11.520 --> 43:15.000
<i>But I can forgive you</i>

43:17.760 --> 43:20.640
<i>You are very close to death</i>

43:21.400 --> 43:24.040
<i>But your eye still clear</i>

43:24.120 --> 43:27.840
<i>Does it recognize me? I'm ready</i>

43:27.920 --> 43:32.840
<i>To seek immortality with you</i>
