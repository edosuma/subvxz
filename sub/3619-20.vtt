WEBVTT

00:06.136 --> 00:08.095
Ah! Damn it!

00:08.269 --> 00:09.444
Shh! Keep it down.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.098
I just got
Chris to sleep.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.708
Well, if you were
here to help me,

00:12.882 --> 00:14.057
you know, that
would maybe help.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.754
Yes. And I will do that,

00:15.928 --> 00:17.756
but first I need to make sure
Wyatt's okay at preschool.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.193
Have you seen the phone?

00:19.367 --> 00:21.412
Preschool? Don't
you mean Magic School?

00:21.586 --> 00:23.023
No. I mean preschool.

00:23.197 --> 00:24.807
We enrolled him
last week. Remember?

00:24.981 --> 00:27.375
You didn't tell
me that. Did you?

00:27.549 --> 00:30.073
Yes. And you said
you were worried

00:30.247 --> 00:33.076
about him using
magic in public.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.339
Oh. And what
did you say?

00:35.513 --> 00:36.471
I said I was worried

00:36.645 --> 00:37.907
about him having
a normal life.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.778
Huh. All right. Cool.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.432
I'm all up to speed now.

00:41.606 --> 00:42.694
Just, with
these charges,

00:42.868 --> 00:43.956
and these
demons attacking,

00:44.131 --> 00:45.610
hey, I'm a little
scattered.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.395
And that's different
how exactly?

00:47.569 --> 00:49.745
I just don't know
why the Elders
couldn't see fit

00:49.919 --> 00:50.963
to give me
a local witch

00:51.138 --> 00:52.661
instead of a
New Zealand witch.

00:52.835 --> 00:54.489
I don't know,
but I need the phone.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.143
No.

00:56.317 --> 00:57.666
No.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.015
No using the phone.

00:59.189 --> 01:00.538
Why are all

01:00.712 --> 01:02.018
the handsets up here?

01:02.192 --> 01:04.281
Because I am trying
to prevent a demon attack.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.936
What?
Look, all the attacks
have been different, right?

01:07.110 --> 01:09.199
And all the demons
have had different powers.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.201
The one thing I've noticed
is that,

01:11.375 --> 01:13.725
every time a phone rings,
a demon attacks.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.466
No, they don't.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.903
Phoebe called earlier,
and nothing happened.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.384
Really?[Elder call]

01:20.558 --> 01:22.821
Ugh! Stop the jingling already.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.997
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

01:25.172 --> 01:26.260
Charges.

01:26.434 --> 01:28.784
[ringing]

01:42.102 --> 01:42.885
Piper!

01:43.451 --> 01:44.800
[screams]

01:47.542 --> 01:49.805

WOMAN [on phone]:
Bye-bye.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.576
That was Wyatt's preschool.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.317
I wonder what
they wanted.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.319
Well, I am more interested
in these demons

03:52.493 --> 03:53.755
and what theywanted,

03:53.929 --> 03:55.365
and try to figure out
how to vanquish them.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.367
It just doesn't
sound right.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.500
Why would demons attack
when the phone rings?

03:59.674 --> 04:01.153
And they're all different
demons. Remember?

04:01.328 --> 04:03.852
The last one even
looked kind of human.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.593
Better add some
mandrake root

04:05.767 --> 04:07.464
in case they're
shape-shifters.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.118
Right. The last
attack happened

04:09.292 --> 04:11.120
when the preschool
called, too, didn't it?

04:11.294 --> 04:14.993
Yeah. I think
you're right.

04:15.167 --> 04:18.083
Do you think Wyatt
is creating these demons?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.390
That's ridiculous.

04:20.564 --> 04:21.870
Well, he created
the dragons.

04:22.044 --> 04:23.828
One! One lousy dragon,
and you're going

04:24.002 --> 04:26.135
to hold it against him
for his entire life!

04:26.309 --> 04:27.267
Oh, no!

04:27.441 --> 04:28.442
Let me guess.

04:28.616 --> 04:29.965
Another demon attack?

04:30.139 --> 04:31.401
Or Wyatt's acting up again.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.229
Or Paige is
overreacting again.

04:33.403 --> 04:34.752
Wyatt has been
isolating

04:34.926 --> 04:37.799
himself at preschool,
and only talking to himself.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.889
Who said he's only
talking to himself?

04:41.063 --> 04:42.760
I heard the message.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.719
That's odd.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.198
No. Not odd.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.200
Just because he's
talking to himself

04:48.375 --> 04:50.246
does not mean
he's creating demons.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.727
Except he's kind of quiet
around home.So?

04:52.901 --> 04:54.816
So Wyatt's in his second stage
of development.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.384
I mean, his sense of language
should be maturing,

04:57.558 --> 04:58.907
which means he should be talking

04:59.081 --> 05:00.822
to other people,
not just himself.

05:00.996 --> 05:03.390
I'm very sorry
you went back to college.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.609
I know, but it's really helping
with my column.

05:05.783 --> 05:07.219
And that has absolutely
nothing to do

05:07.394 --> 05:08.525
with why Wyatt
is creating demons?

05:08.699 --> 05:11.572
He's not
creating demons!

05:11.746 --> 05:13.748
Let's see. Maybe it's
a reaction to preschool.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.184
Some kind of

05:15.358 --> 05:17.229
Freudian transference
or something?

05:17.404 --> 05:18.579
Mumbo-jumbo.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.494
Look, all I'm saying is,

05:20.668 --> 05:22.365
if he's talking to himself,

05:22.539 --> 05:25.107
the problems may be normal,
not magical.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.978
Normal problems like what?

05:27.152 --> 05:28.850
I have no idea.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.852
It could
be anything.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.594
I could ask my professor.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.247
She's the expert.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.424
But I... I don't...Be back soon!

05:38.773 --> 05:40.905
Hey, what
are you doing?!

05:41.079 --> 05:42.211
Put the phone down!

05:42.385 --> 05:43.560
I have to call
the preschool.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.954
Well, then use
your cell phone.

05:52.264 --> 05:53.353
Miss Henderson.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.311
Hey. I came as
soon as I could.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.705
Leo, what are
you doing here?

05:57.879 --> 05:59.968
Um... Well, you called
about Wyatt, right?

06:00.142 --> 06:02.579
Yeah, but I said it was
nothing to worry about.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.364
I thought I had
made that clear.

06:04.538 --> 06:05.843
Well, I was
in the area.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.149
Is he all right?

06:07.323 --> 06:08.759
He's just talking
to himself.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.544
I mean, I wouldn't
have even bothered calling

06:10.718 --> 06:12.372
if your wife
hadn't asked me to.

06:12.546 --> 06:13.895
She's very protective.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.244
He's... he's a special kid.

06:15.418 --> 06:16.898
Oh, they're all
special, Leo.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.943
Right, but he
has special needs.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.945
Special needs?

06:21.119 --> 06:23.905
You never said Wyatt
was a special needs child.

06:24.079 --> 06:27.038
Not like that.
He's, uh... gifted.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.736
First child?

06:28.910 --> 06:30.868
Is it that obvious?

06:31.042 --> 06:32.827
Do you want to see him?

06:33.001 --> 06:34.481
Please.

06:39.224 --> 06:41.226
Oh, there he is.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.665
Oh. Uh...
How long has

06:44.839 --> 06:46.884
he been doing that--
talking to himself?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.669
Oh, I don't know.

06:48.843 --> 06:51.280
On and off since he first
started coming here, I guess.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.457
And, uh...
is that normal?

06:54.631 --> 06:56.851
Normal? No.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.288
But I don't think
you should be alarmed.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.768
He's just playing
by himself.

07:00.942 --> 07:03.118
Lots of kids do that.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.469
I really like our
conversations, Wyatt.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.732
But you know I'm
a secret, right?

07:08.906 --> 07:10.821
Nobody else
can see me.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.954
MISS HENDERSON:
You're just not used to letting
him go during the day.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.260
Happens to lots
of first-time parents.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.046
It's more complicated.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.569
I see this every day.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.310
Trust me. It's not.

07:21.484 --> 07:24.879
You know, he wasn't feeling
very well this morning.

07:25.053 --> 07:26.750
Maybe I should just
take him home, you know?

07:26.924 --> 07:28.665
Just... just
to be safe.

07:28.839 --> 07:31.276
Well, okay,

07:31.451 --> 07:32.800
if you really
think that's best.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.279
Now, we won't be able
to talk much longer,

07:34.454 --> 07:35.846
but don't worry.
I'll be back.
Thanks.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.500
I promise.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.155
Okay, buddy, come on. You ready?

07:40.329 --> 07:41.504
Let's go home, okay?

07:41.678 --> 07:42.766
Oh!

07:42.940 --> 07:44.551
See you soon, Wyatt.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.770
I want to hear more
about that special teddy bear.

07:46.944 --> 07:48.772
We'll see you later.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.955
Vicus!

07:59.435 --> 08:00.784
I was getting worried.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.046
You failed me.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.787
We didn't fail.

08:03.961 --> 08:06.007
We've been distracting
the witches for you,

08:06.181 --> 08:07.617
dying relentlessly!

08:07.791 --> 08:08.966
But you haven't sustained
the distractions.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.664
The father

08:10.838 --> 08:12.274
took the boy from school

08:12.448 --> 08:14.232
just as I was starting
to make some progress.

08:14.406 --> 08:17.714
What? Forget him.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.673
We don't need his powers.

08:19.847 --> 08:22.240
Dealing with the Charmed Ones
is too dangerous anyway.

08:22.414 --> 08:24.373
Do you think you
know how to do this

08:24.547 --> 08:26.288
better than I do, Hugo?

08:26.462 --> 08:28.290
That's not what I'm saying.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.119
You've been working at this
for what--

08:31.293 --> 08:32.860
three weeks now?

08:33.034 --> 08:35.340
We're risking everything here,
and for what?!

08:35.515 --> 08:37.821
For us! To add his power
to yours-- to the collective.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.870
Now, didn't I risk everything,

08:43.044 --> 08:45.437
nurturing the evil
within you, Hugo,

08:45.612 --> 08:47.352
just as I did
with all the others?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.661
Yes, of course you did, but...

08:51.835 --> 08:54.185
Well, then you
must trust me.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.144
See, this Wyatt
will grow to become

08:56.318 --> 08:58.189
one of the most
powerful witches to
ever walk the earth.

08:58.363 --> 09:01.279
It's better he walk
withus than against us.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.064
I just worry.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.631
Don't.

09:04.805 --> 09:07.503
I realize that I only
have a small window

09:07.677 --> 09:09.592
at this age in
which to change him,

09:09.766 --> 09:12.029
but I am close.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.466
Very close.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.087
Um... Professor
Slotkin?

09:26.261 --> 09:28.045
Sorry, Miss Halliwell.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.395
I don't have time to discuss
your paper topic right now.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.093
No, no. It's not
about the paper.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.747
It's actually
personal.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.792
Oh?

09:35.966 --> 09:37.751
Yeah, it's about my nephew.
He's two

09:37.925 --> 09:39.491
and a half,
and he's

09:39.666 --> 09:41.319
just going through some stuff,

09:41.493 --> 09:43.234
and I was kind of hoping you
could help me understand it.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.062
Terrible twos?

09:45.236 --> 09:46.150
Well, I think

09:46.324 --> 09:47.761
it started out as that,

09:47.935 --> 09:50.241
and now it's just...

09:50.415 --> 09:53.636
Well, at preschool,
he talks to himself.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.595
And then, at home,
he doesn't talk to anybody.

09:55.769 --> 09:58.075
Well, perhaps he has
an imaginary friend,

09:58.249 --> 10:01.644
although he's a little early
for that developmentally.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.951
Well, he's very
advanced for his age.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.735
And, if it was
an imaginary friend,

10:05.909 --> 10:07.694
is that necessarily
a bad thing?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.130
Well, Freud used to think

10:09.304 --> 10:10.914
it was a sign
of immature thinking.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.786
Of course, nowadays, we know

10:12.960 --> 10:15.527
that kids create imaginary
friends for lots of reasons--

10:15.702 --> 10:18.313
companionship,
conflict resolution,

10:18.487 --> 10:21.359
sometimes as a coping mechanism.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.274
Let me write this down.

10:23.448 --> 10:26.843
Oh, and that's Slotkin
with an "S."

10:28.279 --> 10:29.890
You were planning
on giving me credit?

10:30.064 --> 10:31.413
I'm sorry. What?

10:31.587 --> 10:33.807
Well, last week, we discussed

10:33.981 --> 10:36.157
Lorenz's theory
of imprinting in class

10:36.331 --> 10:38.768
and, this week, I read about him
in your column.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.641
I imagine we're discussing
next week's content. No?

10:41.815 --> 10:44.339
No. No. This is actually
about my nephew.

10:44.513 --> 10:47.429
Please. We both know
why you're taking my class.

10:47.603 --> 10:50.824
I'm taking your class
to be a better columnist,

10:50.998 --> 10:52.477
and to understand
human behavior.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.218
I've spent years

10:54.392 --> 10:55.959
studying and teaching
psychology, Miss Halliwell.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.874
Dedicated my life to it.

10:58.048 --> 11:01.095
But I'll be damned if I'm just
going to let you poach my class

11:01.269 --> 11:03.575
to steal a sound bite or two
for your column.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.881
No, but I...You want to learn

11:05.055 --> 11:06.230
about imaginary friends?

11:06.404 --> 11:08.015
Do the research.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.452
I look forward
to reading your paper on it.

11:13.498 --> 11:15.718
LEO:
The truth is, we don't know
if it's a problem or not.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.807
Well, that's what
has me worried.

11:17.981 --> 11:20.070
You know, maybe putting him
in a normal school

11:20.244 --> 11:21.637
wasn't such a good idea.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.552
But we agreed it was
a good idea,

11:23.726 --> 11:25.380
and when we did that,

11:25.554 --> 11:27.599
we knew there was gonna
be some road bumps like this.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.036
Okay, well,
the problem is

11:29.210 --> 11:30.777
we don't know
if the road bumps are magical

11:30.951 --> 11:33.867
or just a normal part
of development.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.957
I wish we could
just ask him.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.524
Okay, well, I think
we're a few years away

11:39.699 --> 11:41.352
from him giving you an answer.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.920
Well, especially if he just
keeps talking to himself.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.360
Whoa!Exactly.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.493
Okay, I like

11:51.667 --> 11:52.973
the Maori people, but, uh,

11:53.147 --> 11:56.106
I'm pretty okay if
I don't see them again.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.457
I think I found out something
about who's been attacking us.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.416
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

12:01.590 --> 12:03.287
Uh, Leo, why don't you take
Wyatt upstairs

12:03.461 --> 12:05.028
so he doesn't hear
that demon talk?

12:08.292 --> 12:11.078
Okay, buddy, let's go upstairs,
take your teddy with you.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.949
Anyway, as I was saying,

12:13.123 --> 12:15.604
I've been searching
through the library
at Magic School

12:15.778 --> 12:17.867
and I think I found something
out about these demons.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.303
And?
And it seems

12:19.477 --> 12:21.262
as if their various
offensive powers

12:21.436 --> 12:23.699
are traditionally associated
with good magic.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.397
Good magic? I thought these guys
were supposed to be demons.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.225
Yeah, I thought so, too.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.662
But it goes to kind of
support the theory

12:30.837 --> 12:31.663
that Wyatt's creating them.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.927
Oh, for crying out loud!

12:34.101 --> 12:35.058
I'm just saying...

12:35.232 --> 12:36.320
[phone rings]

12:39.759 --> 12:42.457
Oh, this is ridiculous!

12:42.631 --> 12:44.546
We can't live like
this, it's crazy!

12:44.720 --> 12:46.417
Where you going?

12:46.591 --> 12:51.292
I'm going to figure out if Wyatt
is behind this once and for all.

12:54.382 --> 12:58.429
Whoa, big guy.

12:58.603 --> 12:59.735
You okay, buddy?

13:06.873 --> 13:10.964
Hey, Wyatt, I promised
I'd be back, didn't I?

13:11.138 --> 13:12.226
Yeah!

13:14.315 --> 13:16.621
Wyatt?

13:23.280 --> 13:24.891
Sh... Remember.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.241
I'm a secret, right?

13:27.415 --> 13:28.764
[laughs]

13:30.635 --> 13:32.028
Hey, I really like
your teddy bear.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.596
Mm...

13:34.770 --> 13:37.425
Maybe you'll let me hold him
some day, huh?

13:37.599 --> 13:40.384
I've got a great surprise
for both of you.

13:40.558 --> 13:42.430
[laughs]

13:47.870 --> 13:51.613
Shoot. What rhymes
with "communicate"?

13:51.787 --> 13:54.355
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

13:54.529 --> 13:56.096
Of course, I'm sure.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.707
But what about the whole
personal gain thing?

13:58.881 --> 14:01.275
Wyatt created a demon
who kidnapped him

14:01.449 --> 14:03.320
and a dragon that
nearly destroyed the city.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.279
I'm not real worried
about personal gain.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.629
I know, I guess just because
I'm a whitelighter now,

14:07.803 --> 14:09.239
I have to think
of these things, right?

14:09.413 --> 14:11.328
Besides, we're casting
it on ourselves

14:11.502 --> 14:14.766
so we can try to understand
what he's not telling us.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.030
So if I switch this...

14:17.204 --> 14:19.423
and I leave that.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.992
Okay. "Help this mother
understand the thoughts

14:23.166 --> 14:24.907
"inside her little man.

14:25.081 --> 14:28.171
Though his mouth be quiet,
let us hear his inner Wyatt."

14:39.052 --> 14:40.096
Mom?

14:42.490 --> 14:44.927
It's me... Wyatt.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.856
Wow, Mom, look at you,
you look great!

15:01.030 --> 15:03.598
Right. Okay... .

15:03.772 --> 15:05.600
Looks like you're
as surprised to see me

15:05.774 --> 15:06.775
as I am to be back.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.124
Yeah...

15:08.298 --> 15:09.778
Back from where?

15:09.952 --> 15:12.912
The future.Oh, no. No, no, no.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.478
We wanted to communicate
with you.

15:14.652 --> 15:16.176
I mean, the younger you.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.829
The two-and-a-half-year old you.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.744
Well, if there's one thing
you guys taught me,

15:19.919 --> 15:22.399
magic may work in mysterious
ways, but it always works.

15:22.573 --> 15:25.098
Where'd you hear that?
That's nice.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.708
I'm surprised to hear you ask.

15:26.882 --> 15:28.275
In the future,
you're always telling me that.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.886
Huh! Well, that's
the future me.

15:31.060 --> 15:34.324
I'm me now who clearly
doesn't have those kind
of brilliant thoughts.

15:34.498 --> 15:37.023
Right. Look, all
I'm saying is

15:37.197 --> 15:39.895
if your spell brought me here,
there's gotta be a good reason.

15:40.069 --> 15:40.896
Well, I don't know.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.245
Do you remember anything

15:42.419 --> 15:43.377
about what
you were going through

15:43.551 --> 15:44.552
when you were two and a half?

15:44.726 --> 15:46.597
No, not really.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.904
So then we're still looking
for that reason.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.601
But still,

15:50.775 --> 15:54.257
this is a fantastic opportunity
that magic's brought us!

15:54.431 --> 15:55.824
For me to see the past,

15:55.998 --> 15:57.478
for you guys to learn
about the future.

15:57.652 --> 15:59.784
Oh, no, no! No, no, no.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.699
We don't want to know
anything about the future.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.614
We don't want to risk
changing it... again.

16:03.788 --> 16:04.876
Again?

16:05.051 --> 16:07.183
Don't ask.Okay.

16:07.357 --> 16:10.186
But until we find out why
magic brought me back,

16:10.360 --> 16:12.232
we could at least try and enjoy
the moment, right?

16:12.406 --> 16:15.496
How did you become
such an optimist?

16:15.670 --> 16:17.150
From you, Mom.[Paige yelps]

16:17.324 --> 16:20.718
You must have turned
over a new leaf
in the future.

16:20.892 --> 16:22.764
Don't count on it.

16:22.938 --> 16:25.288
So that doesn't help
us with our Wyatt.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.247
No.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.076
PHOEBE:
Piper, you home?!

16:30.250 --> 16:32.600
Okay, the professor gave me
some information

16:32.774 --> 16:33.601
that I think
will be useful

16:33.775 --> 16:34.776
Who is he?

16:34.950 --> 16:35.907
Aunt Phoebe,
it's me,

16:36.082 --> 16:36.996
Wyatt!

16:37.170 --> 16:38.910
Why what? Ooh!

16:39.085 --> 16:41.087
This is so amazing.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.566
Did a spell backfire?

16:42.740 --> 16:43.828
How'd you guess?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.091
Yeah.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.353
Yeah, well, you know.

16:46.527 --> 16:47.702
What did your
professor say?

16:47.876 --> 16:49.051
Well, she said that
he probably

16:49.225 --> 16:50.574
was talking
to an imaginary friend

16:50.748 --> 16:51.619
I mean, that...

16:51.793 --> 16:53.795
Not you, you know.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.797
The, the other you
when you were...

16:55.971 --> 16:57.407
This is gonna be
so confusing.

16:57.581 --> 16:58.495
You'll get used to it.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.193
Okay, imaginary friends,

17:00.367 --> 17:01.368
ring any bells for you?

17:01.542 --> 17:02.412
I'm afraid not.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.066
She also said

17:04.240 --> 17:06.982
that he's a little young
for an imaginary friend.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.070
Again, not you, just...

17:08.244 --> 17:09.854
I got it.Right.

17:10.029 --> 17:10.855
[Elder call]

17:11.030 --> 17:12.292
Ah, a te wa!

17:13.336 --> 17:14.381
Sorry.

17:14.555 --> 17:15.686
What language is that?

17:15.860 --> 17:16.774
Maori, your New Zealand
charge, right?

17:16.948 --> 17:17.862
I remember
hearing about him.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.560
Yes, well, he can wait,

17:19.734 --> 17:21.692
because I think this
a little bit more important.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.085
I thought you said there's
nothing more important

17:23.259 --> 17:24.086
than your charges.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.435
Look, mister,

17:25.609 --> 17:26.784
I'm pulling
double duty here, okay,

17:26.958 --> 17:29.135
so no guilt
from the future for me.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.571
Okay, you know what, can we
focus on helping him please?

17:30.745 --> 17:32.225
Look, all I'm saying

17:32.399 --> 17:33.443
is that someone always told me

17:33.617 --> 17:34.749
that whitelighters are the glue

17:34.923 --> 17:35.750
that keeps
the magic world working.

17:35.924 --> 17:38.753
Oh, Paige told you that?

17:38.927 --> 17:40.233
Don't be so surprised.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.410
Do I ever have a life
in the future?

17:43.584 --> 17:44.889
You should go, really.
We'll figure this out.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.630
A te wa!

17:48.632 --> 17:52.549
Okay. So you guys cast a spell
to communicate with me, right?

17:53.594 --> 17:55.030
So let's go talk to me.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.039
Dad!

18:04.213 --> 18:07.129
Hey! Look at you,
you haven't changed a bit!

18:07.303 --> 18:09.131
Maybe a little less gray
and a few pounds lighter.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.307
What?!
Future son.

18:12.482 --> 18:17.618
Hey, is this Chris?
My gosh, he's so small!

18:17.792 --> 18:19.141
Hey, little brother.

18:19.315 --> 18:20.534
Is this before or after
he swallowed the marble?

18:20.708 --> 18:22.057
Marble? What marble?

18:22.231 --> 18:23.537
Easy on the future
information.

18:23.711 --> 18:24.712
Of course, you're right.

18:24.886 --> 18:26.061
No, but really,
what marble?

18:26.235 --> 18:27.497
You want to explain
what's going on?

18:27.671 --> 18:28.759
Apparently,
they brought me here

18:28.933 --> 18:30.544
to figure out what's
wrong with me.

18:30.718 --> 18:32.459
Is that still my room?

18:32.633 --> 18:33.982
Explain.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.289
If you let me see
Mr. Bear,

18:36.463 --> 18:38.508
I will give him right back,
I promise.

18:38.682 --> 18:41.032
No...
Hey, don't I know you?

18:42.295 --> 18:43.644
You look familiar.

18:43.818 --> 18:46.603
Wait. You can see me?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.214
What do you mean?
Of course, I can.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.912
PIPER:
Wyatt, who are you
talking to?

18:51.086 --> 18:52.131
What's going on?

18:52.305 --> 18:53.697
That man,
you didn't see him?

18:53.871 --> 18:55.177
See who?

18:55.351 --> 18:56.961
He was just there
talking to... me.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.529
Me? What do you mean,
you or him?

18:59.703 --> 19:02.532
Both.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.886
The boy was just starting
to trust me.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.106
He was about to give me
the bear.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.803
Where did this other witch
come from?

19:12.977 --> 19:14.065
What other witch?

19:14.240 --> 19:15.545
The one who saw me.

19:15.719 --> 19:18.940
Now, how is that possible?

19:19.114 --> 19:22.291
It doesn't matter.
They know you now.

19:22.465 --> 19:25.338
I told you this was gonna be
too dangerous.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.731
I made it so that
only Wyatt could see me.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.951
Well, then they must have found
a way through your powers.

19:30.125 --> 19:34.782
No. No, this witch who saw me
seemed surprised.

19:34.956 --> 19:39.961
Still, he thought he knew me.

19:40.135 --> 19:43.791
And his name was Wyatt, too.

19:43.965 --> 19:46.097
We may have an opportunity here.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.925
I don't follow.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.232
Don't you see?

19:50.406 --> 19:51.886
If I made it so that
only Wyatt can see me,

19:52.060 --> 19:54.584
then that means this other witch
must be Wyatt, too.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.238
They conjured him
from the future.

19:56.412 --> 19:59.067
An older Wyatt, a good Wyatt.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.243
But doesn't that make it worse?

20:01.417 --> 20:04.028
If this future Wyatt is good,

20:04.203 --> 20:07.118
then that means you
never infect the boy.

20:07.293 --> 20:08.729
Gather the collective.

20:08.903 --> 20:09.904
We need to attack now!

20:10.078 --> 20:11.210
Distract the sisters

20:11.384 --> 20:12.776
with everything you've got.

20:12.950 --> 20:16.215
What do you plan to do?

20:16.389 --> 20:19.130
I'm gonna get the boy
to give me that bear.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.090
With it, I'll finally
turn him and then,

20:22.264 --> 20:24.962
I'll watch the future change
before my very eyes.

20:33.841 --> 20:36.365
I know a demon when I see one
and that was a demon.

20:36.539 --> 20:37.627
But you didn't
actually see him.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.107
Well, okay, some creepy
invisible guy

20:39.281 --> 20:40.848
standing over my son,
I'd say that's a demon!

20:41.022 --> 20:42.937
I know how it sounds, Mom,
but I'm telling you,

20:43.111 --> 20:44.373
he just didn't seem
like a demon.

20:44.547 --> 20:45.679
He wasn't threatening at all.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.811
Maybe it was an
imaginary friend.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.031
No, imaginary friends are
imaginary, hence the name.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.728
Plus, you said he's too young

20:51.902 --> 20:53.774
to have an imaginary friend,
remember? He's two.

20:53.948 --> 20:54.862
Actually I'm 25.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.864
I... I know what you mean.

20:57.038 --> 20:59.954
Look, you just...
you don't have any idea

21:00.128 --> 21:02.348
how much we've already been
through just to make sure

21:02.522 --> 21:03.784
that you turn out okay.

21:03.958 --> 21:05.089
I know exactly
what you went through.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.830
And it's all gonna work out.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.745
The fact that I'm standing here
in front of you right now

21:08.919 --> 21:09.920
happy and healthy
should tell you that.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.400
Okay, fine.

21:11.574 --> 21:13.272
Then you won't mind ID'ing
the demon

21:13.446 --> 21:15.578
so we can keep you happy
and healthy.

21:16.884 --> 21:17.885
Don't make me ground you.

21:18.059 --> 21:18.929
All right.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.541
PHOEBE:
So...

21:21.715 --> 21:24.108
just out of curiosity,

21:24.283 --> 21:26.633
do you have any cousins
in the future?

21:26.807 --> 21:29.897
No, don't answer that.
Nice try.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.420
Wait a sec.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.248
I think you're right.

21:33.422 --> 21:37.774
He is a demon.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.472
PIPER:
"Vicus is a demon who preys
on children,

21:39.646 --> 21:41.691
turning them down
the path of evil."

21:46.914 --> 21:48.002
[shrieks]

21:50.134 --> 21:53.964
[distant crashing]

21:54.138 --> 21:55.792
Okay.

21:55.966 --> 21:59.013
Okay, buddy, Daddy's
gotta go check on Mommy, okay?

21:59.187 --> 22:00.231
I'll be right back.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.669
All right,
you stay here, okay?

22:09.458 --> 22:10.981
I'll never
leave you, Wyatt.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.681
I'll always
be here, I promise.

22:14.855 --> 22:16.073
Now, show me

22:16.247 --> 22:17.814
that you believe me.

22:17.988 --> 22:21.383
Let me see your teddy bear,
just for a second.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.298
Then I'll give
you both a big surprise.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.349
[fighting, crashing]

22:52.196 --> 22:53.807
Enough!

22:53.981 --> 22:55.939
Leave my family alone!

22:58.159 --> 23:01.815
[demons shrieking]

23:04.426 --> 23:05.427
LEO:
Everything all right up there?

23:05.601 --> 23:08.387
Oh, yeah, we're fine.

23:16.438 --> 23:19.136
Wyatt, what's going on?

23:20.399 --> 23:21.312
Piper!

23:21.487 --> 23:23.097
Good.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.843
Don't touch it!

23:30.017 --> 23:31.497
I like it.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.458
Dad. What happened?

23:41.028 --> 23:43.030
Wyatt?

23:43.204 --> 23:44.031
What happened to you?

23:44.205 --> 23:46.816
Who are you?

23:47.948 --> 23:49.515
Who is who?

23:50.690 --> 23:52.082
Who's he talking to?

23:53.170 --> 23:54.824
The demon.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.480
Follow me.

24:11.101 --> 24:15.105
Ah, I just feel so free.

24:15.279 --> 24:17.368
I can't believe I spent
a whole other lifetime

24:17.543 --> 24:21.155
weighed down by that repressive
morality, by all that good.

24:21.329 --> 24:22.678
Well, I'd like
to give that feeling

24:22.852 --> 24:23.940
to more good witches...

24:24.114 --> 24:25.681
with your help.

24:25.855 --> 24:26.943
One thing I don't
understand, though,

24:27.117 --> 24:28.467
is why do you hole yourselves up

24:28.641 --> 24:29.990
in this dank lair?
It's so depressing.

24:30.164 --> 24:34.037
Perhaps. But it's safer.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.387
Down here,
good doesn't dare attack us.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.389
Yeah, well, the future
of evil is above ground.

24:38.564 --> 24:41.001
Trust me. We shouldn't
be hiding when we've the power

24:41.175 --> 24:42.655
to take over
their world if we wanted.

24:42.829 --> 24:43.743
There'll be
plenty of time

24:43.917 --> 24:45.353
for conquering later.

24:45.527 --> 24:49.357
For now, there's still
the matter of your family.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.098
They'll want
to change you back.

24:51.272 --> 24:53.317
I know. I also know that
soon they'll find a way

24:53.492 --> 24:54.667
to scry for our location.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.930
Then we must attack
them before they do.

24:57.104 --> 24:58.801
No. We want them to find us.

24:58.975 --> 25:00.673
I know them
all too well.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.675
It's too risky
to fight them at the manor,

25:02.849 --> 25:04.285
but here we'll
have the advantage,

25:04.459 --> 25:05.678
because we'll
be waiting for them.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.680
You would kill
your own family?

25:07.854 --> 25:09.899
Watch me.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.910
Are you telling me that
our child is evil?

25:21.084 --> 25:21.911
Again?

25:22.085 --> 25:23.260
Look, all I'm saying

25:23.434 --> 25:24.566
is that however
he changed future Wyatt,

25:24.740 --> 25:25.872
it started
with the bear, okay?

25:26.046 --> 25:27.003
He cursed it somehow.

25:27.177 --> 25:28.570
He-he made it glow.

25:28.744 --> 25:31.617
Okay, then we need to get
that bear away from him.

25:31.791 --> 25:32.748
Can I have this?

25:33.836 --> 25:35.708
Thank you. Okay.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.670
Phoebe, don't
make him angry.

25:41.844 --> 25:42.715
Look, we need

25:42.889 --> 25:44.107
to act fast, okay? We need

25:44.281 --> 25:45.500
to find a way
to reverse the curse

25:45.674 --> 25:46.936
before future Wyatt

25:47.110 --> 25:48.198
does something evil.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.591
I-I think we
should take him

25:49.765 --> 25:50.766
to Magic School.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.202
I think he'd be safer there.

25:52.376 --> 25:53.464
PHOEBE:
That's a good idea.

25:53.639 --> 25:54.988
And take The Bookwith you.

25:55.162 --> 25:55.945
There may be something
in there that can help.

25:56.119 --> 25:56.946
What are you gonna do?

25:57.120 --> 25:58.078
I'm gonna get Paige

25:58.252 --> 25:59.296
and see if we can find Vicus.

25:59.470 --> 26:00.602
Maybe if we
vanquish him,

26:00.776 --> 26:02.299
all of this will go away.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.388
And if neither one
of those works?

26:04.563 --> 26:06.390
Then we're screwed.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.045
Paige!

26:14.050 --> 26:16.966
Luckily, we have
enough demon ash

26:17.140 --> 26:20.100
that we should be able
to scry for Vicus's lair.

26:20.274 --> 26:22.015
Yeah, well, I wish
I was a little bit

26:22.189 --> 26:23.059
more confident
in this potion.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.452
What do you mean?

26:24.626 --> 26:25.671
It's fine
for the demon,

26:25.845 --> 26:26.976
but what about Wyatt?

26:27.150 --> 26:29.239
Well, we're not
gonna fight Wyatt.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.633
We might not have a choice
because he's on the demon side.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.156
I don't think he
tried to kill us.

26:33.330 --> 26:34.593
And how can you be so sure?

26:34.767 --> 26:36.725
I can't. But you know what?

26:36.899 --> 26:38.292
If Piper can't
change Wyatt back,

26:38.466 --> 26:39.859
then we're gonna have
to vanquish the demon

26:40.033 --> 26:41.121
and hope that that does it.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.905
And, of course,
we have

26:43.079 --> 26:45.429
the added problem of not being
able to see the demon.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.388
Only Wyatt can see Vicus.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.303
We're just gonna have
to bring a lot of vials.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.957
And, what? Just
throw them everywhere

26:51.131 --> 26:52.915
and hope we hit something?Yeah.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.177
You have a better idea?

26:54.351 --> 26:55.483
Normally yes, but,
sadly, this time--

26:55.657 --> 26:56.789
no.

26:57.616 --> 26:58.834
Uh! I got him.

26:59.008 --> 27:00.183
Okay.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.794
Better start
filling those vials.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.019
Oh, thank you.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.413
Sweetie, why don't you
let Mommy see the bear?

27:12.587 --> 27:13.893
Come on,
why do you want

27:14.067 --> 27:14.894
that silly bear
anyway?

27:15.068 --> 27:15.938
Look it.

27:16.112 --> 27:17.287
Come on.
I don't think

27:17.461 --> 27:18.419
you're gonna
convince him like that.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.682
I just don't get it. I mean...

27:20.856 --> 27:22.684
he seems as sweet as ever.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.862
Of course he does.

27:27.036 --> 27:29.604
So can you tell me
how this boy

27:29.778 --> 27:32.259
turns into the future
of all evil?

27:32.433 --> 27:34.435
It's not us as parents.

27:34.609 --> 27:37.481
Yeah. You can say that as much
as you want, but it's gotta be.

27:37.656 --> 27:42.051
No, I-I found a reference
on cursed objects

27:42.225 --> 27:44.750
changing children in incremental
degrees over time.

27:44.924 --> 27:47.491
He's two. How much
could he really have changed?

27:47.666 --> 27:49.580
Not much, but if he keeps
in this direction,

27:49.755 --> 27:52.192
in the next 25 years,
he can be pretty far off path.

27:53.497 --> 27:56.065
He will become
the young man we saw.

27:56.239 --> 27:57.806
This is ridiculous.

27:57.980 --> 28:02.768
I mean, if it's all
because of that stupid bear,

28:02.942 --> 28:05.161
then there's got to be
a magical way around it,

28:05.335 --> 28:07.337
a way to change it,
a way to change him.

28:07.511 --> 28:09.296
Right.

28:09.470 --> 28:10.645
Of course.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.429
Right, of course...

28:12.603 --> 28:14.997
but what?

28:15.171 --> 28:18.871
It's just that
curses are difficult.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.917
Often times it's
how it came about

28:22.091 --> 28:23.745
that's more important
than the magic itself.

28:23.919 --> 28:27.009
Okay, well, we'll figure out
the why later, but right now

28:27.183 --> 28:28.489
we need to fix this.

28:35.191 --> 28:37.411
How much longer are
we going to wait?

28:37.585 --> 28:39.979
Patience. Scrying takes time.

28:40.153 --> 28:42.285
And there's the vanquishing
potion to keep my aunts

28:42.459 --> 28:43.547
busy for at
least an hour.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.027
Vanquishing potion?
You never said

28:45.201 --> 28:46.594
anything about that.
Well, you
expect

28:46.768 --> 28:48.074
they're just gonna
show up empty-handed?

28:48.248 --> 28:50.076
Come on, it's not
going to be that easy.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.208
I don't like this.

28:52.382 --> 28:53.949
Stop worrying.

28:54.123 --> 28:56.430
The rest of the collective
is just a shimmer away.

28:56.604 --> 28:59.999
Besides, my aunts won't be able
to see you when you're cloaked.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.831
Wait.

29:06.005 --> 29:06.962
They're coming.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.488
Have any trouble

29:11.662 --> 29:12.489
finding the place?

29:12.663 --> 29:14.100
Where's Vicus?

29:14.274 --> 29:16.450
Around. But you should
be worried about me.

29:16.624 --> 29:17.799
We just want
to help you.

29:17.973 --> 29:19.975
What makes you
think I want your help?

29:20.149 --> 29:22.456
Because we know you
and we know you're good.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.153
That's a lot of
potions you got there.

29:24.327 --> 29:25.851
I thought you
thought I was good.

29:26.025 --> 29:26.982
These are for Vicus.

29:27.156 --> 29:28.114
As soon as we
get rid of him,

29:28.288 --> 29:29.463
all this will be over.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.204
Good luck finding him.

29:41.692 --> 29:44.086
You girls are way off.

29:44.260 --> 29:45.392
We have lots more potions.

29:45.566 --> 29:46.654
Maybe I can help you out.

29:52.268 --> 29:53.095
What are you doing?

29:53.269 --> 29:55.663
Making a point.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.491
Go ahead-- vanquish him.

29:57.665 --> 29:59.232
VICUS:
What?!

30:02.104 --> 30:03.584
So you thought

30:03.758 --> 30:05.281
you'd change me back, did you?

30:05.455 --> 30:06.456
Why didn't that work?

30:06.630 --> 30:08.371
Because I'm not
under any spell.

30:08.545 --> 30:09.808
And you can't
just change me back

30:09.982 --> 30:11.592
by simply vanquishing Vicus,

30:11.766 --> 30:13.159
He still
got to me.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.335
And this is how evil
grows over the years.

30:15.509 --> 30:16.945
I don't plan

30:17.119 --> 30:18.860
on giving you
a chance to change me back.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.557
In fact, I'm gonna
make sure you don't.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.081
But first,

30:22.255 --> 30:24.474
this should keep
you busy for a while.

30:29.610 --> 30:31.090
These are the ones
that killed Vicus.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.395
[demons murmuring]

30:32.569 --> 30:33.832
Have fun.

30:35.268 --> 30:36.356
Oh, and...

30:36.530 --> 30:38.880
no orbing on Paige.

30:53.503 --> 30:54.635
Try it.

30:54.809 --> 30:57.856
"Evil taints what
was once held dear

30:58.030 --> 31:01.772
Remove this curse
away from here."

31:01.947 --> 31:04.210
Well, I guess we'll
just try another one.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.559
It's not gonna work,

31:05.733 --> 31:07.691
just like the last
15 spells didn't work.

31:07.866 --> 31:08.997
Nothing's gonna
change that damn bear.

31:09.171 --> 31:10.825
LEO:
Well, we can't just give up.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.566
What if it's not
just the bear?

31:12.740 --> 31:14.350
What if the problem is Wyatt?

31:14.524 --> 31:16.309
You can't think
like that, Piper.

31:16.483 --> 31:17.745
Why not?

31:17.919 --> 31:20.269
I mean we try and make
the right decisions

31:20.443 --> 31:22.576
and we try and keep him
away from bad influences,

31:22.750 --> 31:24.752
but ultimately he's
his own person.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.493
We can't control him forever.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.974
And we shouldn't try.

31:29.148 --> 31:30.671
All you can do
is try to be

31:30.845 --> 31:32.368
a good influence on him.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.762
And then a demon comes
in right under our noses

31:34.936 --> 31:36.590
and changes him completely.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.809
Okay, well we knew something was
wrong with Wyatt earlier.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.551
We sensed it, we tried
to do something about it.

31:41.725 --> 31:43.902
That's the best you
can hope for as a parent.

31:45.381 --> 31:48.123
Or, we can try another spell.

31:48.297 --> 31:49.777
Yeah, maybe that's the problem.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.258
We're just trying
another spell.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.347
So?

31:54.521 --> 31:56.088
So, why didn't
the demon do that?

31:56.262 --> 31:57.959
He didn't just appear today.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.439
I mean what kept him

31:59.613 --> 32:00.875
from taking the bear
and cursing it,

32:01.049 --> 32:01.963
if it was that simple?

32:02.137 --> 32:03.182
I don't know.

32:03.356 --> 32:06.359
You know, maybe because...

32:06.533 --> 32:08.927
he needed
something else from Wyatt,

32:09.101 --> 32:10.841
and not just
the bear,

32:11.016 --> 32:12.365
but his trust.

32:12.539 --> 32:13.757
[tingly whooshing]

32:13.932 --> 32:15.324
WYATT:
Mom, Dad...

32:16.456 --> 32:17.544
How'd he get in here?

32:17.718 --> 32:19.024
I'm still a Halliwell, aren't I?

32:20.460 --> 32:22.027
I always hated this place.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.071
What do you want?

32:23.245 --> 32:24.768
What do you think I want?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.683
Young me, make sure you don't
screw me up again

32:26.857 --> 32:28.207
and try to turn me good.

32:28.381 --> 32:29.860
Well I hate to break
it to you,

32:30.035 --> 32:30.905
but you don't really have
a choice in that matter.

32:31.079 --> 32:31.993
What are you
gonna do, Mom?

32:32.167 --> 32:34.126
Kill me in order to protect me?

32:34.300 --> 32:35.954
It's a thought.

32:36.128 --> 32:38.782
You always said spanking
was barbaric.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.441
Ouch, that hurt.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.617
Seriously, never had you pegged
as the type of parents

32:47.791 --> 32:49.228
who'd hit your kids.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.454
You stay away from him.

32:58.628 --> 32:59.499
Should I stay away

32:59.673 --> 33:00.674
from this, too?

33:00.848 --> 33:02.719
You can't touch it.

33:02.893 --> 33:04.156
Why not?

33:04.330 --> 33:06.114
It's my magical
inheritance, isn't it?

33:08.682 --> 33:09.857
You're evil now.

33:22.609 --> 33:24.263
Let go of him.

33:27.179 --> 33:29.050
Don't wait up for me.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.234
We were lucky to get out
of there alive.

33:39.408 --> 33:40.453
Ow!

33:40.627 --> 33:41.802
Sorry.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.934
We weren't lucky.

33:44.109 --> 33:47.547
Wyatt wanted us distracted
for long enough to grab Wyatt.

33:47.721 --> 33:50.245
So now that he has him,
what is he gonna do with him?

33:50.419 --> 33:51.942
LEO:
He wants
to take him back

33:52.117 --> 33:54.032
to the future so we can't change
them both back to good.

33:54.206 --> 33:56.208
That's why he wanted
the Book of Shadows.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.471
He's gonna figure out
a way to get that Book.

33:58.645 --> 33:59.689
My nephew is
very resourceful.

33:59.863 --> 34:01.213
Found him, let's go.

34:01.387 --> 34:02.779
You can't just
go right to him.

34:02.953 --> 34:03.867
He's gonna be expecting that.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.217
So?

34:05.391 --> 34:06.392
I can't just sit here

34:06.566 --> 34:07.915
and let my son corrupt himself.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.090
Yeah, but that was
way too easy.

34:09.264 --> 34:10.570
it's gotta be a trap.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.702
PAIGE:
Well, whatever we do,
we have to be

34:12.876 --> 34:14.922
smart about it,
'cause Wyatt is very powerful.

34:15.096 --> 34:17.446
We're going to get
one shot at this.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.796
Well, we know what
his next move is gonna be.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.450
He's gonna go
after the Book.

34:21.624 --> 34:23.365
So maybe we should set
a trap for him.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.411
No, he's not gonna
attack you guys here.

34:25.585 --> 34:27.239
He doesn't want
to have to fight you.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.893
But you said if we go to him,
he'll be expecting it.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.765
He will, which is why

34:31.939 --> 34:33.897
I agree with Phoebe,
we should set a trap.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.291
Only I'll be the one
waiting for him, not you.

34:36.465 --> 34:38.206
Leo, you don't have any powers
to fight him with.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.513
Which is why he won't
sense me as a threat.

34:40.687 --> 34:43.255
Any one of you guys are here,
he's not gonna show up.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.604
Fine, so you get him here.

34:44.778 --> 34:46.388
What exactly are you gonna do?

34:46.562 --> 34:49.261
Well the demon needed Wyatt
to trust him, right?

34:49.435 --> 34:50.653
To hand over
the bear willingly.

34:50.827 --> 34:53.091
I just need him to give it back.Leo...

34:53.265 --> 34:54.831
Look, I may not have any powers,

34:55.005 --> 34:56.224
but I'm not powerless.

34:56.398 --> 34:57.356
I'm his father,
he's not gonna hurt me.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.445
No? Ever read Hamlet?

34:59.619 --> 35:01.055
Hamlet killed his stepfather.

35:01.229 --> 35:02.535
Close enough.

35:02.709 --> 35:03.797
Freud says according to...

35:03.971 --> 35:05.799
PIPER:
Woman, can it!

35:05.973 --> 35:08.584
It's the only way it can
happen, Piper. You know it.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.326
PAIGE:
All right, well,

35:11.500 --> 35:13.415
any sign of trouble,
you call all right,

35:13.589 --> 35:14.938
'cause we're just an orb away.

35:19.073 --> 35:21.771
Be careful.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.425
I will be.

35:45.969 --> 35:47.928
You see that book over there?

35:48.102 --> 35:49.973
I want you to bring it to me.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.584
Understand?

35:57.764 --> 35:58.721
Come on, Dad...

35:59.809 --> 36:01.246
you don't even
have any powers.

36:01.420 --> 36:02.812
That's right, I don't.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.379
So what are you gonna do?

36:04.553 --> 36:05.815
Take away my car keys?

36:05.989 --> 36:07.948
I don't need to do anything.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.558
You're gonna stop yourself.

36:09.732 --> 36:12.431
That's what I always loved
about you, Dad,

36:12.605 --> 36:14.607
you're such a boundless
optimist.

36:14.781 --> 36:16.130
I know you.

36:16.304 --> 36:17.784
I'm your father.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.873
And I know you still have
good in your heart.

36:20.047 --> 36:22.310
Now your optimism
just sounds pathetic.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.399
You know how I know that?

36:24.573 --> 36:25.661
Because this child right here

36:25.835 --> 36:26.967
still has good

36:27.141 --> 36:28.142
in his soul.

36:28.316 --> 36:29.752
Isn't that right, Wyatt?

36:29.926 --> 36:33.016
Get the book, Wyatt... now!

36:33.191 --> 36:34.540
Okay, you don't to, Wyatt.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.585
You can come over here
to me if you want.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.065
Dad, seriously...

36:38.239 --> 36:40.067
I don't want to have
to hurt you,

36:40.241 --> 36:41.590
but if you get in my way...

36:41.764 --> 36:43.766
I don't believe that.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.291
You mind if I come over there
for a second, Wyatt?

36:46.465 --> 36:47.814
Stay away from him.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.337
Is this your woobie?

36:49.511 --> 36:52.297
Could I see him please?

36:52.471 --> 36:53.907
Get away from him now
or I'll kill you.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.301
I don't think you will.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.435
I told you to stop.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.698
I was there when
you were born, Wyatt.

37:02.872 --> 37:03.960
I gave up

37:04.134 --> 37:05.440
my powers for you.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.399
I tried to change
the world for you.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.270
And I would do it again
in a heartbeat,

37:09.444 --> 37:11.098
you know why?

37:11.272 --> 37:12.055
Because I'm your father.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.056
Stop it.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.494
You want to kill me?

37:15.668 --> 37:17.757
Go ahead.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.672
I gave up my life
for you before.

37:19.846 --> 37:20.716
Dad...

37:20.890 --> 37:22.196
please...

37:22.370 --> 37:23.676
Look, I love you.

37:25.025 --> 37:27.114
Do you understand
what that means?

37:30.726 --> 37:33.163
Wyatt, can I see woobie
just for one second?

37:33.338 --> 37:35.078
I promise I'll give him
back to you.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.951
You can trust me.

37:40.910 --> 37:43.304
Thank you.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.438
Here you go.

37:56.230 --> 37:58.319
Dad?

37:58.493 --> 37:59.886
What did you...?

38:01.104 --> 38:02.454
What happened?

38:28.654 --> 38:31.004
Miss Halliwell,
do you have a moment?

38:31.178 --> 38:32.353
Yeah.

38:32.527 --> 38:34.268
I had a chance to look
over your paper

38:34.442 --> 38:35.878
on childhood
imaginary friends.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.403
Yeah, and let me guess.

38:38.577 --> 38:40.709
You found it to be a shallow
pop psyche examination

38:40.883 --> 38:41.841
on the subject?

38:42.015 --> 38:43.277
Hardly.

38:45.366 --> 38:46.585
An A-minus?

38:46.759 --> 38:47.586
Wow, really?

38:47.760 --> 38:49.239
Well, your use

38:49.414 --> 38:52.155
of Kolberg's moral stages
was a bit of a stretch.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.288
But overall, quite insightful.

38:54.462 --> 38:55.594
Thanks.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.683
I especially liked
your supposition

38:57.857 --> 38:59.859
that the impact
of an imaginary friend

39:00.033 --> 39:02.688
can actually last
well into adulthood.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.342
I found that fascinating.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.474
So do I.

39:07.606 --> 39:09.869
Uh, I have to go.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.087
I have to go home

39:11.261 --> 39:12.437
and see me nephew off.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.221
Off? I thought you
said he was two?

39:14.395 --> 39:17.442
No, this is a different nephew.

39:17.616 --> 39:19.444
Actually he's older and
he lives really far away.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.054
But, I'm late.

39:21.228 --> 39:24.405
Um, before you go, I...
I just wanted to apologize.

39:24.579 --> 39:29.932
I prejudged you as a fraud and
you are clearly anything but.

39:30.106 --> 39:32.239
I look forward to reading

39:32.413 --> 39:33.588
your next paper.

39:33.762 --> 39:35.895
And to your next column.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.157
Thanks.

39:37.331 --> 39:38.463
You're welcome.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.430
Please tell me Paige is more
punctual in the future.

39:49.604 --> 39:52.128
I thought you didn't want any
knowledge of the future.

39:52.302 --> 39:53.434
Well a little wouldn't hurt.

39:53.608 --> 39:54.870
Piper...
What?

39:55.044 --> 39:56.611
It's not gonna change anything,

39:56.785 --> 39:59.005
aside from my being
constantly irritated.

40:02.095 --> 40:03.313
Aro ha mai...

40:04.402 --> 40:05.838
that's "sorry" in Maori.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.883
Do I ever get the hang
of this in the future?

40:08.057 --> 40:09.189
[chuckles]

40:09.363 --> 40:10.886
What... what's so funny?

40:11.060 --> 40:12.322
Nothing, it's just...
who do you think

40:12.497 --> 40:13.846
teaches me to be a whitelighter?

40:14.020 --> 40:16.022
Me?

40:18.720 --> 40:19.591
WYATT:
Well, I guess

40:19.765 --> 40:20.809
I'd better get going.

40:22.115 --> 40:24.465
Not that it matters with
time travel at all, but...

40:24.639 --> 40:25.597
just to be safe.

40:27.555 --> 40:29.078
Aunt Paige...

40:29.252 --> 40:30.993
thanks for everything you're
about to do for me.

40:31.167 --> 40:32.125
Oh, well,

40:32.299 --> 40:34.127
you're welcome, I think.

40:36.085 --> 40:39.262
Dad...

40:39.437 --> 40:41.264
thanks for not
giving up on me.

40:41.439 --> 40:42.614
You can count on it.

40:45.181 --> 40:46.835
Aunt Phoebe...

40:47.009 --> 40:48.402
I think you
should hold on

40:48.576 --> 40:50.317
to that imaginary friends
paper of yours.

40:50.491 --> 40:51.318
Why?

40:51.492 --> 40:52.972
For my little cousin.

40:53.146 --> 40:54.147
Mm...

40:55.496 --> 40:56.715
Bye.
Bye.

41:00.588 --> 41:03.461
Don't worry about me
so much, okay, Mom?

41:03.635 --> 41:08.074
Sorry. That's the one
thing that won't change.

41:14.602 --> 41:16.778
I'll see you.
See you.

41:26.396 --> 41:27.310
"A son in the future,

41:27.485 --> 41:28.747
"a son in the past.

41:28.921 --> 41:30.662
"Seeing anew what
once has passed.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.577
"Return him now
to whence he came,

41:32.751 --> 41:34.274
"right when he left

41:34.448 --> 41:36.494
all now the same."

41:44.806 --> 41:46.025
Bye.

41:47.592 --> 41:48.593
Look!

41:49.811 --> 41:52.727
Fire truck!
