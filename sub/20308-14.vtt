WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:04.379
(chattering)

00:04.462 --> 00:05.714
HOWARD: Item five.

00:06.381 --> 00:10.552
Revised arrest guidelines
for Operation Pushover day four.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.053
(all groaning)

00:12.137 --> 00:16.307
PCP. Two or more tinfoil packets
now constitutes possession

00:16.391 --> 00:18.393
with intent to distribute.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.563
All right.
Cannabis, anything over one ounce.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.356
Pills, more than six.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.485
The new regs say
that you have got a felony arrest.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.530
Two tins of... is a PWID?
Used to be ten.

00:30.613 --> 00:31.448
-Told ya.
-Mm-hmm.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.451
Sarge, we really gonna pop these guys
for a heavy ounce of dope?

00:34.534 --> 00:37.620
-(agreeing)
-All right, courage, people.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.330
Michigan Avenue is inundated.

00:39.414 --> 00:43.126
The arraignment courts
are grinding to a stop.

00:43.209 --> 00:46.296
The public defenders' sick outs
are at an all-time high,

00:46.379 --> 00:51.092
but, as gentlemen,
we applaud the council's good intentions.

00:51.843 --> 00:55.221
All right. Back to item six, moonlighting.

00:55.305 --> 00:57.098
(all groan)

00:57.182 --> 01:01.811
In brief, division memo 609 declares,
the experiment is over.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.023
Effective this date,
no more after hours jobs.

01:05.106 --> 01:08.151
-Go home to your dependents and selves.
-You believe this?

01:08.234 --> 01:10.070
Item seven. Assignments.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.864
Malachy, Olmstead, Russo,

01:12.947 --> 01:15.658
the hooker-john operation on Stiveson.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.785
-Uh, Ryan and Sturneck.
-Yo.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.661
-Yeah.
-Abandoned cars.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.916
Detective Belker continues
his produce undercover,

01:22.999 --> 01:27.128
and, by the way,
has excellent yams at 60 cents a bag.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.172
I am all out of yams.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.507
Surely you'll reorder.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.842
I don't know if I'll reorder.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.803
-Well, that's too bad.
-(chattering)

01:34.886 --> 01:36.805
-Well, um...
-WOMAN: Yeah.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.973
Oh, before you go.

01:39.057 --> 01:40.934
Uh, on a personal note.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.310
News, Lieutenant?

01:42.393 --> 01:46.856
Robert, the title "sergeant"
would suit me all my life.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.694
However, it is true that my review

01:51.778 --> 01:56.449
has been given a date certain
five weeks from tomorrow.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.661
Reinstatement to my former lieutenancy

01:59.744 --> 02:03.331
is apparently all but assured.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.959
(all murmur, applaud)

02:06.042 --> 02:07.043
HOWARD: Thank you.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.129
<i>Vaya con dios.</i>

02:09.212 --> 02:11.256
Uh, everybody. Hey, everybody.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.424
Uh, my little cousin's
got a science project.

02:13.508 --> 02:16.928
Need a large to extremely large cockroach.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.389
Gotta be alive. Appreciate your help.

02:19.472 --> 02:23.393
What little cousin is referring to
is the W105 rock-a-roach contest.

02:23.476 --> 02:28.773
Happens to pay $1,005 for
the largest roach apprehended today.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.692
Hey, you know, this dump is roach heaven.

02:30.775 --> 02:35.029
Me and Neal are giving 50 bucks
for anything over three inches.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.157
You know, this moonlighting
situation is ridiculous.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.408
Job tonight's canceled, Renko.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.617
No, they said it's canceled after tonight.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.162
No, no, no, no. As of this date.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.206
Hey. I've been thinking
about the blonde hairs in your sink.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.459
-Spare me. Please.
-Oh, come on. Listen.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.004
I bring my Roto-Rooter,
and it don't cost you nothing.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.634
Salvatore, my man.
The topic is cockroaches.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.928
Now, me and Neal figure,
going from pipe to pipe,

02:59.012 --> 03:02.056
you know where's the main nest,
the big guys, huh?

03:02.140 --> 03:04.309
-Sub basement.
-I told ya.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.978
Sal, I never been down there.
Where is it?

03:07.645 --> 03:10.273
-Hey. Sal.
-She's perfect.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.777
WOMAN (on radio):

And, no offense, but, um, aren't
your locks a little straight, anyway?

05:10.810 --> 05:13.146
This is The Ravers, man.
We're talking about The Ravers here.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.524
Yeah, not only do we get 100 bucks
for checking coats,

05:16.607 --> 05:19.152
but we also get to take part
in guitar history.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.362
The Ravers haven't cut a record
in ten years.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.822
That's because
they've been living in France.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.366
You see, music is like
a circle that is never broken.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.368
Rock and roll. Country.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.538
Music to stare at the wall by,
1,001 strings.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.666
As a matter of fact, The Ravers are very
heavily influenced by Johnny Cash.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.461
Johnny Cash is from Jamaica?

05:36.544 --> 05:39.672
No, but they're influenced by him, and--
Like this. Listen to this.

Hey, look at me.

-Get him up.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.103

-Oh, yeah. Hell, yeah.

06:44.946 --> 06:48.116
-How many dead, Officer?
-Officer... I gotta call in.

06:48.199 --> 06:51.285
Nah, we're too busy re-arresting the ones
the court let out yesterday

06:51.369 --> 06:52.662
in order to run over women and children.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.081
What, you had this Rivera guy yesterday
and you let him go?

06:55.164 --> 06:56.916
No, I didn't let him go.
Some judge let him go.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.251
A judge? Who? Which one?

06:58.334 --> 07:01.129
Some judge. What's his name? I don't know.
In a white tower somewhere.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.673
I just wish he'd come down long enough
to drive to Van Buren and Shaw

07:03.756 --> 07:05.842
and see what his revolving door
of justice looks like

07:05.925 --> 07:07.885
before they scrape it up off the sidewalk.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.680
-(chattering)
-MAN: Officer, a few more questions...

07:10.763 --> 07:11.722
Lieutenant.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.144
Your bad penny's come back,
Miss Davenport.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.646
There's a 263 eye witness report coming.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.023
We're getting some statements
now if you wanna wait.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.157
-You my lawyer again?
-Turn around.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.867
Warm, Norm.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.537
Just give me
and Lieutenant Goldblume a minute,

07:34.620 --> 07:36.289
a minute to make our escape.

07:36.914 --> 07:40.418
What are you, funny today?
Your diaper pins tickle, or what?

07:40.835 --> 07:43.629
You ever think maybe people
got tragedy in their lives?

07:43.713 --> 07:45.715
Hey, I'm sorry I'm alive.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.301
Guy floors it, runs over the grandmother

07:48.384 --> 07:50.428
while the mother
and the nine-year-old son watch.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.512
Oh.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.599
Hey. Hey, come here. Give me that paper.

07:55.224 --> 07:56.225
Give me the paper.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.732
You know why you
don't know anything, Flaherty, huh?

08:02.815 --> 08:04.275
'Cause you ain't lived enough.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.032
Mr. Rivera, did you speak to
any witnesses at the scene?

08:12.825 --> 08:15.077
I, uh... I don't know.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.749
I'm not sure you want to answer this,

08:19.832 --> 08:22.418
but are you under the influence
of any drug at the moment?

08:23.336 --> 08:27.798
Look, I got a problem,
and I request rehabilitation.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.800
Did you tell witnesses at the scene

08:29.884 --> 08:33.888
that "The sign said don't walk,
and they was walking."

08:36.599 --> 08:39.143
-I don't know.
-You do know three people are dead.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.897
No one told me anyone's dead.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.610
The witness says
you continued to accelerate

08:47.693 --> 08:50.404
through the crosswalk
and the sidewalk until your car

08:50.488 --> 08:53.658
was caused to stop by the bus stop bench.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.993
Did you see the lady sitting on the bench?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.164
(heavy breathing)

09:00.831 --> 09:05.378
Mr. Rivera, you didn't deliberately run
those people down, did you?

09:05.878 --> 09:06.879
No, ma'am.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.340
They got hit
'cause it was their own fault.

09:18.474 --> 09:19.976
Did you get the BCI
on your client, Counselor?

09:20.059 --> 09:21.227
Yes, thanks.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.989
Look, before you start,
if there's anything I can do...

09:33.406 --> 09:34.824
Look, it ain't about me.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.827
If it was about me,
the last person I'd ask is you, all right?

09:40.371 --> 09:42.373
(chuckles)

09:42.456 --> 09:46.335
NORMAN:
Say, uh... say there's a regular guy.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.588
He's got this good-looking wife.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.465
Uh, everything's great to the naked eye.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.426
Then suddenly, out of the blue,

09:54.260 --> 09:56.095
she starts whoring around on him.

09:56.178 --> 09:59.473
You mean turning tricks
like the, uh, Lawrenson wife case?

09:59.557 --> 10:01.392
No, no, she's just cheating on him.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.352
So what's the question?

10:05.104 --> 10:07.857
Well, uh, do you tell the guy or not?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.234
What could you say?

10:11.319 --> 10:12.320
The truth.

10:14.071 --> 10:16.282
That, uh, it pains me to tell a man this,

10:16.365 --> 10:18.909
but you got horns.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.081
(clears throat)
Maybe just slip him a note, huh?

10:24.915 --> 10:26.000
Children?

10:26.083 --> 10:28.252
-Not by this union.
-Do I know him?

10:28.336 --> 10:31.339
What is this? You just ask questions back,
and that's supposed to be a big help?

10:31.422 --> 10:34.425
Look, in my opinion,
it depends on what kind of a guy he is.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.011
Maybe he knows already.
Maybe he'd rather not know.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.013
Okay, all right. List-- Uh...

10:39.930 --> 10:41.891
(sighs) Say he's...

10:42.433 --> 10:44.185
say he's a leadership guy.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.437
Uh, he's a regular guy.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.689
Maybe a little underweight.

10:49.398 --> 10:52.401
Uh, and he's got a good-looking wife.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.696
-That kinda guy.
-Who are we talking about here, Norm?

10:56.864 --> 10:58.741
Hey, I don't need this,
Lieutenant, all right?

10:58.824 --> 11:01.827
As far as I'm concerned, we never even
had this conversation, all right?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.372
-Norm, wa-- Hey.
-(Norm clears throat)

11:04.872 --> 11:07.041
J.D.: Ow. Yeah, I lost it.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.252
-Where is it?
-NATE: Over your head, man.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.796
Unless you moved.

11:12.421 --> 11:16.759
-J.D.: Oh, I got it. Ready?
-NATE: Uh-huh.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.762
(grunts)

11:19.845 --> 11:20.846
(sighs)

11:24.684 --> 11:27.478
-They're too quick, babe.
-Yeah, but the size.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.313
We gotta try again.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.315
This time we'll wait
till the queen comes out.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.818
Hey, sport, there's gotta be a better way.

11:39.448 --> 11:40.741
J.D.: Hey, Neal, you there?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.539
NATE: Where would I go?

11:47.373 --> 11:49.250
Charged with three counts
of vehicular homicide

11:49.333 --> 11:50.876
and murder in the first degree.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.462
On for bail application.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.883
-Nice tie.
-Keep your head low, Joyce.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.553
Mr. Bernstein.

12:00.636 --> 12:04.557
Your Honor, three people are dead,
Mr. Rivera failed his urinalysis,

12:04.640 --> 12:07.685
and, given the fact that he was
just in here yesterday--

12:07.768 --> 12:11.105
Yeah. Wondered when we would get to that.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.233
Misdemeanor charge,
wasn't it, Mr. Bernstein?

12:15.693 --> 12:18.237
Under the new prosecution guidelines,
which I happen to support,

12:18.320 --> 12:20.573
I would have thought you
had a felony charge out of that.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.409
-Approach the bench, Your Honor.
-No.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.620
Because if I had known of such a charge,

12:26.704 --> 12:31.417
Mr. Rivera would not have gone
out on $100 bail yesterday.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.754
He would not have gone anywhere.

12:35.671 --> 12:38.924
Apparently, the police did not request
felony offender treatment.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.552
-I don't know why.
-Officer Renko, what about this?

12:42.803 --> 12:45.347
Uh, well, sir, Your Honor,
it's my understanding it's a felony,

12:45.431 --> 12:47.016
and I don't know nothin' more about it.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.184
Oh.

12:49.435 --> 12:50.936
JUDGE: Well, I think I know
a little more about it.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.023
(sighs) Let me just muse a moment on this.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.028
How many times
has the judiciary of this city

12:59.445 --> 13:02.698
been charged with so called
revolving-door justice?

13:02.782 --> 13:05.451
How many times have district attorneys
and the police complained

13:05.534 --> 13:08.204
that we are soft on these, uh, people?

13:08.537 --> 13:09.955
And now we have a crackdown.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.124
Because finally we are, uh, we're fed up.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.544
Nauseated by these repeat offenders.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.715
And lo and behold it is the police

13:19.799 --> 13:22.885
who turn Mr. Rivera loose on the street.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.554
Well, not today, Mr. Rivera.

13:26.472 --> 13:29.141
Remanded. Without bail.

13:30.893 --> 13:31.769
BAILIFF: All rise.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.356
And if inquiring minds
from the press want to know

13:35.439 --> 13:39.109
why a dangerous criminal
only had his wrist slapped,

13:39.944 --> 13:42.530
take it up with
Police Chief Daniels this time.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.323
Not with me.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.037
All right, so how about it, officers?
What's the story now?

13:50.120 --> 13:52.039
How come this guy was let go yesterday?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.585
(chattering)

14:01.173 --> 14:04.677
-Gene.
-What the hell is going on over here?

14:04.760 --> 14:08.889
Rivera's dirty way, way,
way over the new council guidelines,

14:08.973 --> 14:10.683
and somebody throws him back?

14:11.934 --> 14:12.893
No.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.062
Shag time, Frank.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.606
-Who's responsible?
-The precinct commander.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.233
You were at Michigan Avenue yesterday.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.777
Whose watch was it,
and let's get him in here.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.571
That tone carries, Gene.

14:25.322 --> 14:27.658
GENE: Yeah, well, that's the tone
I'm getting from Daniels.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.076
Henry.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.245
Luce, do me a favor?

14:32.955 --> 14:34.331
How are we on Rivera?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.125
Reconstructing.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.669
I've still got people to ask.

14:38.752 --> 14:41.547
We're checking the possibility that maybe
a booking number got switched.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.715
How could that happen?

14:43.632 --> 14:48.470
-I don't know.
-Great. Great, Goldblume. Smooth move.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.349
I'll tell the chief he can go back
to his crossword puzzle.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.105
You better get your act together, Captain.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.240
So they're looking
for the sacrificial goat.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.868
Where's "The slob let Rivera go?"

15:10.951 --> 15:13.203
The incompetent,
turns killers loose on the street

15:13.287 --> 15:16.415
even though if our wonderful city
council's regs had been listened to.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.250
-Henry.
-I went down there. My God.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.086
They had to lift the car
off the old woman with a tow truck.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.255
And Rivera's blood test
was completely crazy.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.214
He was out of his mind.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.550
Henry, if you're protecting somebody,
I won't have it.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.927
We were busy as hell.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.764
Maybe a booking number did get switched.
Maybe the arresting officer or me.

15:31.847 --> 15:33.515
(stuttering)
I'm the most likely candidate.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.225
I make out the grand jury lists.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.312
Frank, come on.
The point is the new regs are bull.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.730
Excuse me. That's not the point.

15:39.813 --> 15:43.609
If I'd come to you-- If I'd said,
"Here's-here's a minor bust."

15:43.692 --> 15:47.029
Now, technically, it's a felony,
but the possession is questionable.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.198
Under normal circumstances,
we'd kick it totally.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.992
I would have said,
"Honor the council's intention."

15:52.076 --> 15:53.160
No discretion.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.622
No cop savvy, just let the whole system
run itself aground.

15:57.247 --> 16:00.125
-Henry, have you been--
-Scuttling the great Operation Pushover?

16:00.209 --> 16:02.336
Uh-uh, Frank. No, I haven't.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.755
I've been trying to live with these regs.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.382
Look, Howard makes out
the transmittal list.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.884
-Have you asked him?
-(sighs)

16:08.968 --> 16:11.053
Ask him, Henry.
We need to know what happened.

16:11.136 --> 16:11.971
Find out, all right?

16:16.642 --> 16:17.559
(door shuts)

16:19.520 --> 16:21.021
Have you seen Sergeant Hunter?

16:21.355 --> 16:22.898
He's around somewhere, Lieutenant.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.608
J.D.: It's almost ready.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.443
Scissors.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.740
Toothpick.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.243
Come on, man. Toothpick.

16:37.121 --> 16:38.789
All right, now. Wait a minute.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.166
Wait a minute.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.877
One-- Here. Got it.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.131
Okay, Neal. Feast your eyes.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.925
The Caesars Palace of roach motels.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.677
Look at that. Huh?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.431
-It's sticky inside.
-Yeah, so?

16:56.557 --> 16:58.684
Oh, death by adhesion, gentlemen.

16:59.268 --> 17:02.354
Remarkably like the killer tar pits
of prehistoric yore.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.232
No, no, no,
the contest rules say it's gotta be alive.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.609
I'll fix it. Thanks, Sarge.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.154
Now, by the by, your assignment today is?

17:10.237 --> 17:12.740
Uh, prepping the Feldbaum case, Sarge.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.158
Howard? A minute?

17:18.412 --> 17:21.707
-Yesterday's charge sheets. You file them?
-Yes, indeed.

17:22.082 --> 17:25.627
As I remember, the felony list
was on an old envelope, sorta ripped.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.630
Ah, yes, blue and gray.

17:29.214 --> 17:34.511
An order envelope for <i>Musketball Magazine,</i>
box 30-Z, Tempe Arizona, 85283.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.679
It's a good outfit.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.139
Any chance you could locate it?

17:37.222 --> 17:40.642
Well, in truth, Henry, I don't remember
this fella Rivera being on it.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.686
Just check, okay?

17:43.562 --> 17:44.688
(speaks Spanish)

17:46.607 --> 17:48.942
-(people grumbling)
-Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.320
-Hey, Jacqueline.
-Hey, hello, Lieutenant Buntz.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.364
Did I ask you hello? So shut up,
all right? Come on. Come here.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.825
Come here. Shut up. Shut-- Hey, hey.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.827
Why don't you just shut up, girls, huh?

18:00.287 --> 18:01.413
Here. Come here.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.749
A freebie, Lieutenant?

18:03.832 --> 18:06.001
-Will you shut up, Jackie, huh?
-Yes, sir.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.213
All right, several years,
this marriage goes all right.

18:09.296 --> 18:12.966
He's paisan, she's yacht club.
Don't ask me how it got started.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.720
But, any event, she is now
sleeping around on him,

18:16.804 --> 18:17.638
and he's a friend of mine--

18:17.721 --> 18:18.847
Who? Is this your Italian captain?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.558
Hey, will you shut up
till I finish, all right?

18:21.642 --> 18:24.269
These are high-class people, Jackie.
You wouldn't know any of 'em.

18:24.812 --> 18:28.899
So, uh, you being a whore,
you got professional experience

18:28.982 --> 18:32.277
in this cheating and lying
and breaking up of happy homes,

18:32.361 --> 18:33.737
and how come it happens?

18:35.155 --> 18:37.032
Hey, whoa. Are you deaf?
I asked you a question.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.450
What question was that?

18:39.576 --> 18:42.704
(sighs)
Why would a woman do that to a man?

18:43.580 --> 18:45.791
I don't know.
Just to get his attention, probably.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.460
-Yeah?
-Hey, look, Lieutenant.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.046
Why do you think we do our toes, huh?
It ain't for our feet.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.217
So, uh, what does he do?

18:56.051 --> 18:59.680
Take her someplace nice, you know?
Spend a little money on her for once.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.685
So, uh, how about it, Lieutenant?
You gonna give me a pass on my pop?

19:04.768 --> 19:07.521
Huh? Nah. For what?

19:07.604 --> 19:10.357
-Oh, come on. You scum, Buntz.
-Come on. Come on.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.948
(humming)

19:18.657 --> 19:19.908
(chuckles)

19:19.992 --> 19:22.286
Precisely where memory placed it.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.046
Hm.

19:36.717 --> 19:40.345
Ma'am, could you not make
fingernails in my eggplant?

19:40.888 --> 19:43.056
-WOMAN: Hey.
-I should eat rotten?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.935
Lady, would you not do that to that dog?

19:49.646 --> 19:52.274
Thirty-eight cents. Some people.

19:54.860 --> 20:00.073
-Hey, my check! I just got paid.
-Come back here, you mutt!

20:07.206 --> 20:09.458
(panting)

20:13.253 --> 20:14.338
Whose dog is that?

20:14.630 --> 20:20.302
I don't know nothin' about nothin',
and that's the secret of my success.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.097
Guy over at the pool hall,
Puerto Rican looking guy.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.933
-What's his name?
-Bud.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.476
Bud?

20:27.851 --> 20:31.271
I call everybody Bud.
That's just the way I am.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.315
Thank you.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.824
First I gotta see the Grand Tetons.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.745
Look, the coat stays closed.
I'm freezing, okay?

20:47.663 --> 20:50.499
-You wanna go to a party or not?
-I don't know.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.293
Bleed to death, would ya?

20:56.421 --> 20:57.756
Yams come in?

20:59.591 --> 21:04.513
Tina, you think you could move
your operation a half a block down my way?

21:04.596 --> 21:08.058
I got this very weird purse snatching
thing down there.

21:08.141 --> 21:09.977
All I'm getting around here
is a runny nose anyhow.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.061
All right.

21:12.562 --> 21:15.899
Hey, Lieutenant. You know,
they're calling you the subversive cop?

21:15.983 --> 21:17.567
What? What are you talking about?

21:17.651 --> 21:19.987
Well, your friend Steve Merkur
shoots a police officer,

21:20.070 --> 21:21.488
you speak out and defend him.

21:21.571 --> 21:24.408
Now there's this thing with letting
the bus stop killer go free.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.912
-You're nuts. Where'd you get that?
-Hey, the clipping's in the morgue.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.122
Your name keeps coming up

21:30.205 --> 21:32.708
like a pattern of a guy
who's bucking the system.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.335
-I think that's pretty subversive.
-Look, why don't we find a place to talk?

21:35.419 --> 21:37.796
Mr. Carnie, what is this?
Feeding time at the shark pool?

21:37.879 --> 21:40.257
You're not supposed to be back here.
Come on. Come on.

21:42.342 --> 21:43.302
Howard.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.849
-You find anything?
-No, I didn't.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.226
Thanks for looking.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.064
Sergeant. Heard about your review.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.859
-Go get 'em.
-Ah, thanks, Chief.

21:59.985 --> 22:03.822
Yeah, well, I'm in the contest.
What's the biggest one you got so far?

22:04.239 --> 22:05.782
I mean, approximately.

22:06.158 --> 22:09.453
Huh? Yeah, okay. Thanks a lot.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.293
-Well, what'd he say?
-Ah, they can't tell me anything.

22:16.376 --> 22:18.420
No bugs accepted before 3:00.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.714
Okay, your independent estimate.

22:21.965 --> 22:24.426
Two and a half. Big roach, J.D.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.763
I'm sorry to tell you this animal
is in a weakened condition.

22:28.180 --> 22:31.266
You're nuts. Look, he's scampering around.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.018
He's got nothing to eat in there.

22:33.101 --> 22:35.937
-Get him some lettuce.
-That's for turtles.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.939
You're absolutely right.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.692
Anyhow, any you guys know who it is

22:40.776 --> 22:43.362
that Captain Furillo's wife
is sleeping around on him with?

22:43.445 --> 22:46.198
-Say what?
-Hey, why don't you shut your face, huh?

22:46.281 --> 22:47.824
Lieutenant, I didn't mean nothin'.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.037
Dumb as a bag full of hammers.
They don't get nothing right.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.919
-Henry.
-What is it, Howard?

23:00.462 --> 23:03.006
The chief would like to see you
in the captain's office.

23:13.850 --> 23:14.851
Hello, Henry.

23:16.686 --> 23:18.522
Chief, I was in station command yesterday.

23:18.605 --> 23:19.940
Sit down, Lieutenant. Relax.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.359
I asked you to be brought in,
and I'm here to listen.

23:23.318 --> 23:25.195
Frankly, I think the press, the TV,

23:25.278 --> 23:27.948
they're bending
this Rivera thing around on us.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.366
But maybe we can straighten them out.

23:29.449 --> 23:31.451
One thing,
we've tripled our arrests this week.

23:31.535 --> 23:34.079
Absolutely,
and I'll make that crystal clear.

23:34.454 --> 23:37.833
Now, on the individual himself,

23:37.916 --> 23:40.001
did we have him, and what happened?

23:41.795 --> 23:42.921
Henry.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.133
You wanna know the truth?

23:46.675 --> 23:47.551
The truth?

23:48.510 --> 23:49.594
Can't fool around on this.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.264
It's the new regs, sir.
They're a bad deal.

23:52.347 --> 23:55.267
Not only are they unenforceable,
they're misleading.

23:56.059 --> 23:56.893
Council worked them out.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.854
They're the whole basis
of Operation Pushover.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.480
I know, but they're just a PR job.

24:00.564 --> 24:02.691
-They're a setup.
-And I signed them, Lieutenant.

24:02.774 --> 24:04.151
You didn't answer the question, Henry.

24:04.484 --> 24:05.819
Why wasn't Rivera held?

24:06.736 --> 24:07.863
Because I let him go.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.197
What?

24:09.698 --> 24:12.742
I checked,
and that's what must have happened.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.829
Facts off the arrest report
suggest officers had no cause to frisk,

24:15.912 --> 24:17.873
so, uh, I must have seen that,

24:17.956 --> 24:20.041
realized we would have lost
to the suppression hearing,

24:20.125 --> 24:21.418
and just charged the misdemeanor.

24:21.501 --> 24:22.461
I'm not hearing this.

24:22.544 --> 24:25.630
Maybe I'm justifying my own behavior
because people got killed...

24:25.714 --> 24:26.882
-Just a second.
-...but I'm not!

24:26.965 --> 24:32.012
I'd probably do it again.
Save three court appearances, two lawyers,

24:32.095 --> 24:35.182
twenty hours cop overtime,
scarce bed in the slam.

24:35.265 --> 24:38.602
The hell with it.
It's always gonna be a judgement call.

24:38.685 --> 24:39.811
It's a lousy call.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.939
We've got a highly publicized operation
out there in full swing.

24:43.023 --> 24:47.402
No, sir. Council doesn't just vote
and suddenly all the warts disappear.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.320
They go poof.

24:48.403 --> 24:50.697
Frank, is this your policy?
Not to enforce guidelines?

24:50.780 --> 24:53.700
I know what Henry's trying to say,
but he's saying it badly.

24:53.783 --> 24:54.868
Very badly.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.786
He's telling me
he's in charge here. Is that it?

24:56.870 --> 24:59.748
He runs the department?
The hell you do, Lieutenant.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.459
Somebody's gotta make the calls,
and it's not city council.

25:02.542 --> 25:04.836
I make the call! You're out of here.
How do you like that?

25:04.920 --> 25:06.755
Suspended pending a review board.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.884
And, Frank, I still want that report.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.147
Take your time.

25:28.068 --> 25:32.656
Uh, this <i>Così fan tutte</i>
is supposed to be funny, huh?

25:33.657 --> 25:34.658
What's it about?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.327
-Infidelity.
-No, no.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.704
That, uh, that other one you mentioned.

25:39.788 --> 25:43.792
Sir, in <i>Fidelio,</i>
she saves her husband's life.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.587
And there's no boys
dressed up as girls, huh?

25:47.671 --> 25:50.382
-Nothing like that.
-That's <i>Rosenkavalier.</i>

25:50.465 --> 25:55.554
And as I explained to you, sir,
<i>Der Rosenkavalier</i> is completely sold out.

25:55.637 --> 25:56.888
(clears throat)

25:57.764 --> 26:01.434
Okay, uh, give me two for,
uh, Friday night there.

26:01.518 --> 26:02.686
Ringside.

26:02.769 --> 26:05.480
The one where she saves him.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.566
Loge or dress circle, sir?

26:07.857 --> 26:08.692
MAN: Loge.

26:09.693 --> 26:14.072
Anyhow, uh,
not behind any posts, all right?

26:17.659 --> 26:18.493
Police discount?

26:19.619 --> 26:21.288
Seventy-six dollars, sir.

26:21.997 --> 26:25.625
-Huh?
-You've, uh, crossed a threshold of taste.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.043
(clears throat)

26:33.383 --> 26:35.135
Yeah, there she is.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.304
I promised her
I'd get the 30 bucks I owe her.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.056
(radio chatter)

26:40.140 --> 26:42.392
Patrick, she's undercover. Is that smart?

26:42.767 --> 26:44.811
It'll just look like a standard roust.

26:48.356 --> 26:52.527
I put on a leash and you walk me.
Like a beagle.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.656
-Why would I wanna do that?
-'Cause I buy you to. That's why.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.033
Oh.

26:58.116 --> 27:01.202
Hey, sister. Get out of here.

27:01.870 --> 27:05.498
-What are you doing here?
-Keeping an eye on you.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.668
Yo, Fido, get back here!
Where the hell'd he go?

27:09.085 --> 27:10.629
Get back here!

27:10.795 --> 27:12.922
Fido, get back here!

27:17.886 --> 27:21.598
Hey, it's the thief. Wait a minute!

27:22.015 --> 27:23.433
Hey. Come on.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.989
Don't he get his biscuit?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.283
Yo, man, who you supposed to be?

27:40.367 --> 27:43.703
I'm a police officer. You're under arrest.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.834
Inspector, we both know
that suspension was unwarranted.

27:51.044 --> 27:54.422
No. No, there aren't fatalities
in the Goldblume case.

27:54.506 --> 27:58.218
The fatalities are in the Rivera case.
Let's not miss that distinction.

27:58.760 --> 27:59.636
Be--

28:00.178 --> 28:01.680
Because what happened this morning

28:01.763 --> 28:03.598
could have happened
to a thousand cops in this city.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.393
It was just one of those freak results
that come back to haunt you, that's all.

28:06.476 --> 28:07.769
And I'm getting a little sick

28:07.852 --> 28:10.355
of downtown's hypocritical
self-righteousness.

28:11.564 --> 28:12.732
(knock at door)

28:14.150 --> 28:15.318
Anything wrong, Captain?

28:16.111 --> 28:18.321
I mean, uh, door being closed.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.532
It's just not the best time, Norman.

28:24.160 --> 28:24.994
Here.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.040
Opera tickets?

28:29.582 --> 28:33.586
Yeah, uh, <i>Fidelio.</i> Friday night.
To seats next to each other.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.422
Awfully nice of you, Norman.

28:36.172 --> 28:39.634
But, uh, actually, I think Miss Davenport
has a law seminar this weekend.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.678
-She's gonna be away.
-She's gonna be away?

28:42.303 --> 28:44.389
-You know with who?
-It's just one of those retreats.

28:44.472 --> 28:45.890
They go to a hotel and yak.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.268
Maybe I can talk her out of it.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.854
Hey, yeah, uh,
talk her out of it, Captain.

28:50.937 --> 28:53.314
I mean, uh,
the lady knows a lot of law already.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.358
I mean, uh, she knows lots of it.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.527
But you have to know right away, no?

28:57.610 --> 29:00.697
No, no, no, no, no.
Talk to her, and, uh, Captain,

29:00.780 --> 29:03.491
maybe be a little, uh, persuasive.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.494
Yes.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.997
You know, like you're really
paying her some attention.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.585
(clears throat)

29:16.087 --> 29:17.005
Coffee?

29:20.967 --> 29:22.802
I'm not gonna let them take your badge,

29:22.886 --> 29:25.096
but I think they're seeing an attitude,
and that doesn't help.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.682
I'm not asking for your support, Captain.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.768
Daniels is up on his high horse,
and you put him there.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.231
Three people got killed,
and people are saying I'm responsible.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.983
And I don't really buy that,

29:37.066 --> 29:39.319
but I can understand
how they might think it.

29:41.029 --> 29:45.617
But, as a cop, I was being
the only cop I can be anymore.

29:47.035 --> 29:49.120
The only kind of cop
I think it's right to be.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.165
Do you accept me that way?

29:53.458 --> 29:56.252
-Do you?
-What way do you mean, exactly?

29:58.296 --> 30:00.298
Not kissing any liars' cheeks.

30:00.381 --> 30:02.842
I just wish you'd come to me
when the guidelines came out.

30:02.926 --> 30:03.885
Maybe I should.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.179
Maybe that's right.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.097
But I didn't.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.767
So I think you'd better keep
your distance on this, Captain.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.229
There's a Miss Dot Walker who says
she's returning your call.

30:18.024 --> 30:21.152
I don't even like dogs.
A dog to me is like a piece of dirt.

30:21.736 --> 30:24.072
Dot? Yeah.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.784
Yeah, that's why I called.

30:27.867 --> 30:30.954
Listen, if there's any interest,
I'd like to go on the <i>Don Chesler Show</i> .

30:32.664 --> 30:34.666
Man, I've never seen this dog in my life.

30:39.420 --> 30:40.255
Okay, Raymond.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.716
Hey. Hey. Hey.

30:44.300 --> 30:46.511
-Get off.
-(growls)

30:46.594 --> 30:47.720
Yo, man. What's the matter with him?

30:47.804 --> 30:49.514
The pound's on its way, Detective.

30:49.597 --> 30:52.517
They said if you could just tie the dog up
in the parking lot.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.186
Pound? What for?

30:55.728 --> 30:57.856
Well, he's gotta get locked up
until his case goes to court.

31:00.608 --> 31:03.319
This dog is allowed
one phone call, isn't he?

31:07.907 --> 31:10.743
Uh, still prepping
the Feldbaum case, Sarge.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.204
It's going crazy, Neal. It feels weird.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.039
Scratching right on my stomach.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.708
Well, at least this way
you know he's still alive.

31:16.791 --> 31:17.917
Thanks a lot.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.590
Henry, could I see you a moment?
Privately.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.012
Just say it's none of their business.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.180
Yeah, but they're all asking me.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.184
Hi, honey.

31:35.518 --> 31:37.228
Uh, listen.

31:37.645 --> 31:40.231
Could we talk about your no dogs policy?

31:41.608 --> 31:43.067
-Captain.
-Yes?

31:43.151 --> 31:45.278
I'm kind of on the spot out here.

31:46.779 --> 31:47.947
What would you want me to tell the people

31:48.031 --> 31:49.908
about you and Miss Davenport
getting a divorce?

31:51.868 --> 31:55.622
You pump iron, you do sit-ups at dawn
with your flak jacket on,

31:55.705 --> 31:57.832
wear your Heavy Hands
right into the shower.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.208
Makes your body hard.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.086
But how do you train for inner strength?

32:02.629 --> 32:04.213
Howard, what's up?

32:04.297 --> 32:06.591
And then the test comes, and you flunk it.

32:06.674 --> 32:09.302
Honor, discretion, loyalty...

32:10.803 --> 32:14.223
flush it right down the commode
like so many gum wrappers.

32:14.307 --> 32:15.767
I've gotta go somewhere, Howard.

32:16.601 --> 32:19.938
As you know, I couldn't find the envelope.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.105
Doesn't matter.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.653
But here it is.

32:28.905 --> 32:30.406
Rivera's name is there.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.451
Yes, I hesitated, Henry.

32:34.243 --> 32:36.037
I saw my Lieutenancy slipping away, and--

32:36.120 --> 32:37.664
That's Rivera J.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.333
The physical therapist
with the hand grenades.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.211
It's Curtis Rivera this is all about.

32:45.713 --> 32:48.132
-It is?
-You didn't do anything wrong.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.970
-I didn't?
-I knocked him down to a misdemeanor.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.101
Hm.

32:59.894 --> 33:01.312
Well... (clears throat)

33:03.272 --> 33:05.483
We do so rely on our memories, don't we?

33:06.818 --> 33:09.195
For a moment,
I thought there that, well... (chuckles)

33:16.160 --> 33:17.662
Well. (sighs)

33:17.745 --> 33:19.580
You can imagine my relief.

33:22.083 --> 33:26.671
There I was,
swinging slowly in my own wind,

33:26.754 --> 33:29.132
and I thought-- Oh, Henry.

33:29.382 --> 33:30.341
Listen.

33:30.883 --> 33:34.012
Forgive my self-absorption.
Is there anything I can do to help?

33:34.095 --> 33:36.806
I know what it's like to have
your back against the wall.

33:37.432 --> 33:38.433
I've been there.

33:39.392 --> 33:42.603
Oh, yes, and it's... it's quite awful.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.523
Not necessarily.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.859
You've got nothing to lose.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.155
W105, home of the rock-a-roach.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.824
Okay, let's see what we got.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.827
Are you kidding? How about you?

33:58.202 --> 34:00.747
(scoffs) Nothing. What about you?

34:01.039 --> 34:04.500
This is nothing either.
Let me show you guys a real cockroach.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.504
Huh? Huh?

34:09.213 --> 34:10.965
Yeah. Bye.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.557
Sir.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.769
I'll show you mine if you
show me yours, huh? What do you say?

34:28.608 --> 34:31.152
Aw, Neal, I'm not seeing this.

34:33.654 --> 34:36.699
(laughs) J.D., look what we got here.

34:36.783 --> 34:37.909
-What?
-Tony Priest.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.202
Wait, who are you, man?

34:39.285 --> 34:41.913
You mean to tell me you don't remember
Detective Washington?

34:41.996 --> 34:42.997
Well, I remember you.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.958
You jumped bail on that robbery
at the train station.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.710
-No way.
-Mm-hmm.

34:47.794 --> 34:49.712
-What you talking--
-Hell yeah, Tony Priest.

34:49.796 --> 34:51.255
There's a warrant out for your arrest.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.757
-Wait, hold up.
-He's out of here, Neal.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.134
-He's busted.
-Oh, be fair, dudes.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.844
Let me enter my roach before we go.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.388
No way. Neal's got to sign
for him at the station.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.557
Personal property at the time of arrest.

35:01.641 --> 35:04.602
-You want somebody to think we stole him?
-It ain't right.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.145
I got that rock-a-roach right here.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.730
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Uh-huh.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.363
Just you and me, huh?

35:16.614 --> 35:20.076
And a great, big, fat,
disgusting cockroach.

35:20.952 --> 35:24.038
And if you're responsible
for letting Mr. Rivera go,

35:24.122 --> 35:26.124
what about the people
he allegedly ran down?

35:26.207 --> 35:28.751
Aren't you responsible
for those deaths, too?

35:30.044 --> 35:31.712
Actually, I think that's too simple.

35:32.088 --> 35:35.007
-I think--
-And it's a cheap shot.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.801
I apologize, Lieutenant.

35:36.884 --> 35:40.930
Nobody can apologize.
Not you or me or city council.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.851
Look, people want things
they won't pay for.

35:45.434 --> 35:46.853
So they're responsible, too.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.146
They pay for police protection,
don't they?

35:48.229 --> 35:50.565
But not enough to keep
the bad guys off the street.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.651
Council announces a drug crackdown.

35:53.734 --> 35:57.321
Sounds great on a piece of paper.
Do more. Do a lot more.

35:57.405 --> 36:01.534
But there's not enough cops or judges
or courtrooms or jail cells

36:01.617 --> 36:03.536
or hours in the day to do a lot more.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.705
So everything's still
gotta be a judgement call.

36:05.788 --> 36:08.416
The cops are in the middle.
We'll always be in the middle.

36:08.499 --> 36:12.253
All I'm saying is the public
gets what it's willing to pay for.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.546
Not what it wishes for.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.506
And anybody who tells 'em any different,

36:15.590 --> 36:17.508
that's who's responsible
for the lives snuffed out

36:17.592 --> 36:19.427
at a Dekker Avenue bus stop this morning.

36:20.386 --> 36:22.221
What I haven't said
is that Lieutenant Goldblume

36:22.305 --> 36:25.349
has been suspended
without pay for speaking his mind.

36:25.433 --> 36:27.310
For his message to city council.

36:27.852 --> 36:29.312
And I think it stinks.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.772
And I wanna shake your hand, Lieutenant.

36:32.732 --> 36:36.277
Next up, Don Gregson with some tough talk
about soft fingernails

36:36.360 --> 36:37.862
and what you can do about them.

36:38.529 --> 36:39.614
And we're clear.

36:40.781 --> 36:42.033
Sensational.

36:42.825 --> 36:44.994
Henry, that was so good.
You gave me chills.

36:45.077 --> 36:48.206
Not only that,
Councilman Kearney just called.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.374
Don, Kearney's people were watching.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.794
They want him to come over and testify
before the subcommittee right now.

36:54.503 --> 36:56.297
Come on. The limo'll run you over.

37:02.094 --> 37:04.722
So she's on the table
and the plastic surgeon says,

37:04.805 --> 37:07.433
"Wait a minute. Who wants this
liposuction, you or him?"

37:07.516 --> 37:09.435
-Uh-oh.
-"Him," she says.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.395
"He's the one who calls me Hippo Hips,

37:11.479 --> 37:14.357
Queen of the Cellulite, and he's the one
who's gonna pay the bill."

37:14.440 --> 37:15.900
-Wrong answer.
-Yeah.

37:15.983 --> 37:19.111
The doctor gets real angry.
It's a serious procedure.

37:19.195 --> 37:22.865
His malpractice is unbelievable,
and he won't do it just for a boyfriend.

37:22.949 --> 37:28.287
(sighs) So. What's new with Joyce
since I was up here yesterday?

37:28.371 --> 37:29.580
You need something, Lieutenant?

37:29.664 --> 37:32.792
You know, Joyce. Come on.
Don't hold me in suspense.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.044
I mean, this is better
than <i>Stella Dallas</i> up here.

37:35.127 --> 37:38.005
We have several Joyce's.
To which one are you referring?

37:38.089 --> 37:40.424
We got Joyce Haydash.
We got Joyce Lipnick.

37:40.716 --> 37:43.302
-We got Joyce Davenport.
-Yeah, sure, right.

37:43.386 --> 37:47.890
The Joyce that's, uh, watchama call it
behind her husband's back

37:47.974 --> 37:51.060
and she can't stop on account
of the smell of the new guy

37:51.143 --> 37:52.728
stays in her nose like a memory.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.315
BOTH: Oh, Joyce Lipnick.

38:03.614 --> 38:08.077
Oh, what grace under pressure.
Jeez, Henry, you looked superb.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.912
I even imagined a tan.

38:11.664 --> 38:13.749
-Forgot to take the makeup off.
-(chuckles)

38:13.833 --> 38:18.254
A guy offered me $15,000 for the book
I'm writing, Howard.

38:18.337 --> 38:23.092
Mm. No doubt to be ghosted
by some bearded white wine liberal,

38:23.175 --> 38:24.969
imposing vacillation on every line.

38:25.052 --> 38:28.139
Have you considered the protection
of co-authorship?

38:28.556 --> 38:29.557
Excuse me.

38:31.017 --> 38:34.520
Uh, he's here, Chief.
Yeah, I should tell him.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.649
Council took a vote after you left.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.234
They approved three new judges,

38:40.318 --> 38:42.069
forty additional cadets
at the police academy,

38:42.153 --> 38:44.155
and a study for a new
reformatory facility.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.532
-Huh?
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

38:47.074 --> 38:51.203
Yeah. I'll tell him to drop by.
Thanks. I agree.

38:51.287 --> 38:52.621
Under the circumstances.

38:54.623 --> 38:58.085
The chief is dropping your suspension.
He says you actually did us a service.

38:59.754 --> 39:00.671
Frank...

39:02.506 --> 39:03.424
Yes, Henry?

39:08.804 --> 39:10.014
All right!

39:10.848 --> 39:13.017
We've been asking for that stuff all year.

39:13.601 --> 39:15.770
Son of a gun. Son of a gun!

39:16.103 --> 39:18.397
You did it. You beat the system.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.066
But I was wrong.
I mean, doesn't it kill ya?

39:20.149 --> 39:21.984
I was wrong, and yet I was right.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.987
I mean, I had nothing to lose,
so I just went ahead.

39:25.571 --> 39:28.783
It had nothing to do with me.
I was detached. I didn't even care.

39:28.866 --> 39:30.701
And we made our point.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.954
I even enjoyed it. Me.

39:34.580 --> 39:38.376
Chief wants to see you this afternoon.
My advice is to listen and nod a lot.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.211
Don't worry. Boy.

39:42.588 --> 39:45.549
Frank, I caused you trouble. It was, uh...

39:46.425 --> 39:48.052
I didn't think there was any other way.

39:48.135 --> 39:50.888
I'll take it the way it came out, Henry.
I couldn't be happier.

39:50.971 --> 39:52.556
-Boy, what a weight off me.
-(knocking)

39:53.682 --> 39:55.309
Lieutenant, uh,
somebody wants to see you out here.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.310
Go.

40:03.067 --> 40:03.984
You've heard?

40:04.068 --> 40:07.363
You have something to tell me?
Confession perhaps?

40:07.446 --> 40:08.989
Never mind the wisecracks.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.575
What are we going to do
about the rumors, Furillo?

40:11.659 --> 40:13.577
Well, I have one idea. Friday night.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.621
I know you have other plans,

40:15.704 --> 40:18.207
but why don't you just drop them
and go out with me?

40:18.707 --> 40:20.459
(laughing)

40:25.089 --> 40:26.257
Ma'am?

40:26.340 --> 40:29.802
-You're Lieutenant Henry Goldblume?
-Yes, ma'am.

40:29.885 --> 40:35.057
You let him go! He killed my mother!
You let him go! You let him go!

40:35.141 --> 40:37.268
Hold on. Hold on.

40:37.351 --> 40:39.145
(woman crying)

40:39.228 --> 40:41.981
-Are you okay, Lieutenant?
-Makeup.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.072
(scoffs)

40:51.323 --> 40:53.784
You know, for a moment there
in the captain's office...

40:55.369 --> 40:56.328
Tell you, Howard,

40:57.413 --> 40:59.707
happiness, it's an elusive commodity.

41:04.086 --> 41:07.298
So, Lieutenant, I've,
uh, canceled my other plans.

41:07.381 --> 41:08.966
She took me up on my offer.

41:09.842 --> 41:11.427
They're wonderful seats, really.

41:11.510 --> 41:13.512
And even if you didn't buy them,
you could have just sold them.

41:13.596 --> 41:15.264
Seventy-six bucks.

41:16.474 --> 41:20.978
-Norman, you didn't buy them, did you?
-Who, me? Hey, Captain...

41:21.061 --> 41:22.438
Then where did they come from?

41:23.397 --> 41:24.565
Frank, we should reimburse him.

41:25.107 --> 41:28.777
Hey, it's no big deal.
I mean, as long as you're gonna use 'em.

41:28.861 --> 41:31.530
Norman, if you paid for these tickets,
there's no way I can take them.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.948
I didn't, all right?

41:33.032 --> 41:35.159
Captain, you want me
to take a polygraph, or what?

41:35.242 --> 41:37.828
I mean, I just happened to have 'em
around, all right? Jeez.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.831
-Okay. Thanks.
-Hey, no big deal.

41:40.915 --> 41:43.042
Just, uh, you two, you know...

41:44.168 --> 41:45.586
enjoy yourselves.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.676
Yes. Uh, excuse me, Captain, sir,
and Mrs. Furillo.

41:52.760 --> 41:55.012
-Can I speak to you for a minute, sir?
-What is it, Andy?

41:55.554 --> 41:58.807
Well, sir, it's about this
moonlighting situation. These new regs.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.768
You see, tonight we're supposed to
work on this party,

42:00.851 --> 42:02.978
this reggae party,
and it's The Ravers and all,

42:03.062 --> 42:05.314
-and we thought that, uh--
-Absolutely not.

42:05.397 --> 42:08.943
-Outside jobs are out as of today.
-Well, see, we interpreted it--

42:09.026 --> 42:10.903
It's a rule that just came down, Andy.

42:10.986 --> 42:12.988
And since it's a rule,
let's just follow it, okay?

42:14.198 --> 42:15.824
Okay. Night, Captain.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.162
(door closed)

42:22.122 --> 42:26.085
By the way, who were you going on
that yak weekend with, anyway?

42:27.711 --> 42:28.921
J.D.: Hey, it's coming on.

42:29.004 --> 42:31.924
-Flaherty, where you sneaking off to?
-I'm not sneaking off.

42:32.758 --> 42:34.510
Hey, quiet, everybody.

42:34.593 --> 42:36.679
J.D., are you gonna buy us
all some cheesesteaks

42:36.762 --> 42:38.514
-after you win this thing?
-Oh, yeah.

42:38.597 --> 42:41.559
-If we win.
<i>-...W105 Rock had a beauty contest...</i>

42:41.642 --> 42:42.476
All right.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.271
<i>...with the winner worth $1,005.</i>

42:45.813 --> 42:47.481
<i>And here she is strutting her stuff.</i>

42:47.565 --> 42:48.899
-J.D.: Hey, look.
<i>-Yeah, it's a cockroach.</i>

42:48.983 --> 42:51.360
-Neal.
<i>-But, more correctly...</i>

42:51.443 --> 42:54.113
Neal. Neal, it's ours.

42:54.196 --> 42:57.241
-We won!
-(laughter)

42:57.324 --> 42:58.826
Look at the size of that.
How much did you win on that thing?

42:58.909 --> 43:01.954
One thousand and five dollars.

43:02.037 --> 43:04.164
Unbelievable.
Look at the size of that thing.

43:04.248 --> 43:07.334
<i>Our congratulations to Mr. Fugilisi's</i>
<i>seventh-grade class...</i>

43:07.418 --> 43:09.420
J.D.: Hey, wait. Wait a minute.

43:09.503 --> 43:12.881
No, no, it's fixed.
They didn't catch it. They grew it.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.800
Now, we got a legitimate protest here.

43:14.883 --> 43:16.760
-Let's go, cowboy.
<i>-</i> REPORTER: <i>And that's tonight's news.</i>

43:16.844 --> 43:18.304
Neal, we gotta fight this.

43:18.762 --> 43:20.139
Some other time, J.D.

43:21.890 --> 43:25.769
So, Sergeant Bates,
is she seeing anybody regular?

43:25.853 --> 43:26.812
Do you think?

43:34.903 --> 43:38.616
Sit. Sit. That's it.

43:38.699 --> 43:42.661
No. No.

43:43.495 --> 43:47.041
That's a good dog.
I'm glad we had that little talk.

43:48.042 --> 43:50.002
Mick, are you coming to bed?

43:50.085 --> 43:52.212
Yeah, I was just walking the dog.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.464
I already let him out.

43:53.547 --> 43:55.049
-You did?
-Yeah, in the back.

43:55.132 --> 43:58.469
(barks)

43:58.552 --> 43:59.762
What's the matter?

44:16.987 --> 44:20.616
I'm thinking I'm gonna make you
a big breakfast tomorrow.

44:22.326 --> 44:23.160
Cooking?

44:24.370 --> 44:26.080
Is that something else you're good at?

44:27.873 --> 44:28.957
(chuckles)

44:29.041 --> 44:30.584
When you're good, you're good.

44:32.002 --> 44:33.003
Patrick...

44:34.838 --> 44:36.632
I don't want you to make me breakfast.

44:38.926 --> 44:39.885
I mean, I don't...

44:41.261 --> 44:43.222
I don't think I want you to stay over.

44:47.309 --> 44:48.394
Do you mind?

44:51.397 --> 44:53.273
It's not a question
do I mind or don't I mind--

44:53.357 --> 44:55.609
It's just that I got this morning routine.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.112
You know, I... I wake up...

44:58.946 --> 44:59.947
it's quiet.

45:00.864 --> 45:01.740
I like it.

45:03.826 --> 45:05.577
I'm kinda funny about it.

45:07.871 --> 45:09.748
You don't think I got a morning routine?

45:14.169 --> 45:15.129
Okay.

45:19.466 --> 45:20.384
Okay.

45:22.970 --> 45:24.680
So do we sleep a little now?

45:25.597 --> 45:29.560
-Or do I hop up--
-Stay a little. Stay a little.

45:32.771 --> 45:33.605
Then go?

45:38.485 --> 45:39.570
Then go.

45:41.405 --> 45:43.449
You were really good on the show today.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.869
-Was a nice dinner.
-Yeah.

45:48.912 --> 45:50.247
Oh, I don't know.

45:52.207 --> 45:56.670
Maybe what attracts me to you is the fact
that you take it all on yourself.

45:57.588 --> 45:58.714
Dot.

46:02.092 --> 46:03.010
Well...

46:05.304 --> 46:06.305
Okay.

46:09.183 --> 46:10.184
Goodnight.

46:18.942 --> 46:21.320
(door shuts, engine starts)

46:39.505 --> 46:42.925
-DOT: I'll wait.
-Don't. Please. Just... Just go, okay?

46:43.008 --> 46:44.051
Please.

46:54.853 --> 46:57.523
(telephone rings)

46:57.815 --> 46:58.816
Hello.

46:59.817 --> 47:00.818
Yeah.

47:03.320 --> 47:06.615
Well, I-I'd forget about it, Henry.
I'd put it right out of my mind.

47:06.698 --> 47:09.576
And you know what else?
I wouldn't come in till noon tomorrow.

47:10.285 --> 47:11.203
Yeah.

47:40.482 --> 47:43.110
(closing theme playing)
