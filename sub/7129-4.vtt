[Ding]

00:11.000 --> 00:13.583
I was not
a good husband.

00:13.583 --> 00:15.625
But I am a very good dad.

00:15.625 --> 00:18.208
I've never actually seen
a "fuck you" finger that tiny.

00:18.208 --> 00:19.625
Pretty cute, huh?

00:19.625 --> 00:22.291
They're the best thing
I've ever done in my life.

00:22.291 --> 00:24.750
What's all this business
about him calling me Betsy?

00:24.750 --> 00:26.667
Ohh, I told him
not to do that.

00:26.667 --> 00:29.417
No, I said it was
your mother's name,
and you'd hate it.

00:29.417 --> 00:33.000
Heh! That's just like
giving him a gift, isn't it?

00:39.000 --> 00:42.959
How old do you think
she is actually?

00:42.959 --> 00:44.250
No one knows.

00:45.917 --> 00:48.291
But I've got a friend
who did a pilot

00:48.291 --> 00:50.709
with her
and William Shatner
back in the '80s.

00:50.709 --> 00:53.041
Mmm, I know.
It's crazy, right?

00:53.041 --> 00:54.834
That girl--

00:54.834 --> 00:57.417
somewhere she's got
a painting of herself,

00:57.417 --> 00:59.875
and it's looking like
all kinds of shit.

Everybody ready?

Camera rolling.

Pucks!  pilot--
14 Delta, take two.

02:03.417 --> 02:05.041
And action!

02:08.125 --> 02:10.083
She's just not
interested in you.

02:10.083 --> 02:11.291
You don't know that.

02:11.291 --> 02:12.834
Everyone knows that.

02:12.834 --> 02:13.917
Tsk.

02:13.917 --> 02:16.625
Look at her.
She's so hot.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.792
Uh...I'm 12.

02:18.792 --> 02:21.834
Should we be having
this conversation?

02:21.834 --> 02:24.250
Shh! Coach Lyman, please.

02:25.625 --> 02:27.375
[Whispering]
You see there?

02:27.375 --> 02:30.041
The way she was touching
her lips with her finger?

02:30.041 --> 02:32.208
And you're saying she's not
interested? Ho ho ho!

02:32.208 --> 02:34.208
She was shushing you.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.458
She's a librarian.
That's what they do.

02:36.458 --> 02:37.917
That's not all they do.

02:37.917 --> 02:39.917
Again...12.

02:41.125 --> 02:42.333
Besides...

02:42.333 --> 02:44.333
I think
she might be gay.

02:44.333 --> 02:48.208
What? She's not--
Why would you--

02:48.208 --> 02:50.166
What do you even know
about gay?

02:50.166 --> 02:52.542
My dads are gay.
Jesus.

02:52.542 --> 02:53.917
Both of them?

02:53.917 --> 02:55.458
What are the odds
of that?

02:57.417 --> 03:00.000
DIRECTOR: And cut!
That's great.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.667
Let's go again.
Morning, this time,

03:01.667 --> 03:04.125
can you make the shush
a little sexier?

03:04.125 --> 03:06.125
Oh, I think
I can do that.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.875
Did I mention
I hate this show?

03:09.875 --> 03:18.291
I believe
it's come up.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.500
That's mysterious.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.166
What?
What?

03:22.667 --> 03:24.333
It's about Morning.

03:24.333 --> 03:26.000
How old
she actually is.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Oh, dear God. Why are you
so obsessed with that?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.500
I'm not obsessed.
It's just mad.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.125
From everything
we've heard,

03:32.125 --> 03:33.875
she was acting
in that play when
Lincoln was shot.

03:33.875 --> 03:36.291
So? She looks great.
Who cares how old she is?

03:36.291 --> 03:38.750
Right. You're not
the least bit curious?

03:38.750 --> 03:40.250
No, I'm not.
[Scoffs]

03:48.583 --> 03:50.500
SEAN: So?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.834
No. You're not curious.
Oh, come on.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.667
She's...old.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.458
How old?
Old.

03:58.458 --> 04:01.542
Ridiculously old.
She must've been made
in a lab.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.834
Let me see.
No.

04:03.834 --> 04:05.458
Oh, my God.

04:05.458 --> 04:06.875
She's even older
than you.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.208
You fucker.

04:08.208 --> 04:10.000
That's what you're
thinking, isn't it?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.542
Well...
of course it is.

04:12.542 --> 04:13.875
Look at her.

04:13.875 --> 04:15.625
I could be
her mother.

04:15.625 --> 04:16.959
Only if you had her
very young.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.333
Don't agree with me.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.500
All right, fine. But you're much
more attractive than she is.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.041
You are.
She's all plastic.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.959
Those boobs.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.834
Yuck.
Mm-hm.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.250
I'm telling you--
I like the real thing.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.792
Give me a woman
who looks her age.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.417
Five years younger
than her age. Seven.

04:36.417 --> 04:38.291
Ten. Ten years younger.
You're a fetus.

04:38.291 --> 04:40.291
Walk away.
Just walk away.

04:45.917 --> 04:47.500
It's--
Bullshit!

04:47.500 --> 04:49.125
No, not bullshit.

04:49.125 --> 04:50.583
Hey, Seanie!

04:50.583 --> 04:52.625
Come here, you gotta
settle something for us.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.000
Hey, look at you,
all spiffy.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.125
Yeah, I got that
custody hearing today.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.625
Oh, Jesus.
Good luck with that.

04:59.625 --> 05:01.458
I'll be fine.
I'll just give the judge

05:01.458 --> 05:03.291
a couple of
"how you doin's".

05:03.291 --> 05:05.041
Hey, are we gonna
have catch phrases?

05:05.041 --> 05:07.625
Catch phrases.
Oh, no, they're--

05:07.625 --> 05:09.000
they're awfully cheesy.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.208
Yeah? Tell that to
my house in Malibu.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.417
Ha ha! So, what is it
you need settling?

05:13.417 --> 05:15.625
Ah. OK, would you
please tell Morning

05:15.625 --> 05:17.083
that she is not
a lesbian anymore.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.500
Right.
You're not.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.333
It doesn't really
affect the pilot,
but we decided

05:20.333 --> 05:22.625
that if this thing goes,
Nicola should be straight.

05:22.625 --> 05:23.917
No way.

05:23.917 --> 05:25.333
It just kind of
gives us more room

05:25.333 --> 05:27.000
for stories
with the two of you
down the road.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.458
All right! My girl
likes the dick!

05:29.458 --> 05:32.083
[Laughs]

05:32.083 --> 05:34.000
What was that?
He can't high-five. I've tried.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.917
I can high-five.
No.

05:35.917 --> 05:38.166
Well, what can I say?
We're more...

05:38.166 --> 05:40.375
firm handshake
kind of people.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.834
Don't even try to
get him to fist-bump.

05:42.834 --> 05:44.166
Oh, come on!
No.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.000
Come on, come on.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.959
No, I can't.
Seriously, I'll hurt you.

05:47.959 --> 05:49.250
SEAN: Seriously.
MORNING: Yes, yes.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.166
Your hand is
gonna meet my fist.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.250
When I do it,
I look like I need--

05:52.250 --> 05:53.500
No, you're cool.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.500
SEAN: OK, all right.
We'll do it. I'm ready, OK?

05:56.500 --> 05:57.500
And.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.542
Hey!
Yes!

05:58.542 --> 05:59.834
[Laughter]

05:59.834 --> 06:02.583
MATT: Aww.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.291
MORNING: Whoo! Good job!

06:04.291 --> 06:05.667
[Laughs loudly]

06:05.667 --> 06:07.458
Ohh!

06:15.542 --> 06:17.000
What?

06:17.000 --> 06:18.166
Nothing.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.542
You have that look.

06:19.542 --> 06:20.667
No look.

06:22.542 --> 06:23.834
All right.

06:25.166 --> 06:26.917
So...

06:26.917 --> 06:28.875
when Morning was
hugging you today...

06:28.875 --> 06:30.417
There we go.

06:30.417 --> 06:31.959
Did she feel 25,

06:31.959 --> 06:34.417
or could you sense
the withered crone
beneath?

06:34.417 --> 06:35.875
Maybe you should
give her a hug.

06:35.875 --> 06:38.041
I'm sure she'd prefer that
over your evil glare.

06:38.041 --> 06:39.250
I don't have
an evil glare.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.041
Oh, please.
You look at her

06:41.041 --> 06:43.375
the way Cruella de Vil
looked at those puppies.

06:43.375 --> 06:45.667
Not at all. Anyway,
I think it's nice

06:45.667 --> 06:47.083
you've made a new
titsy friend.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.709
She's obviously
quite fond of you.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.709
She's an actress
who wants more lines.

06:50.709 --> 06:52.166
Maybe she can
hug them out of you.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.083
I'm not doing this.
I'm not blaming you.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.625
She's gorgeous,
she's young.

06:55.625 --> 06:58.375
She's not that young.
She's older than you.

06:58.375 --> 07:00.291
That's why I didn't
want to do this!

07:00.291 --> 07:03.750
All right, one more
question about her,
then I'll let it go.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.917
If I were dead--
I'm not playing this game.

07:05.917 --> 07:07.291
Please, one round.

07:07.291 --> 07:09.750
[Telephone rings]
Oh, thank God.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.542
[Ring]

07:12.709 --> 07:13.709
Hello?

07:13.709 --> 07:15.542
Hey, Betsy.
Is Seanie there?

07:17.959 --> 07:19.625
Hello?

07:19.625 --> 07:21.250
Hey, can you do me
a big favor?

07:21.250 --> 07:23.083
Can you come
and pick me up?

07:23.083 --> 07:24.250
What's going on?
Where are you?

07:24.250 --> 07:25.917
What's going on?
Where is he?

07:25.917 --> 07:28.750
Right. Oh, my God.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.709
What? Oh, my God what?

07:30.709 --> 07:33.333
I am so sorry.
What?

07:33.333 --> 07:34.917
And he's just sitting
out there waiting?

07:34.917 --> 07:36.083
Who?
Who's sitting where?

07:36.083 --> 07:37.166
Where's Santa Clarita?

07:37.166 --> 07:38.625
Why are you writing
that down?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.667
You're not going
to Santa Clarita!

07:40.667 --> 07:42.667
I'm leaving now.
You're going
to Santa Clarita.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.709
Matt lost his
custody hearing.

07:45.709 --> 07:47.959
Ohh, my God.

07:47.959 --> 07:49.959
Oh, that was
your "Oh, my God".
Right.

07:49.959 --> 07:52.125
Now he's at this bar
by the courthouse,

07:52.125 --> 07:54.291
and there's some
paparazzi guy outside,

07:54.291 --> 07:55.834
waiting for him
so he can take pictures

07:55.834 --> 07:58.291
of Matt
driving home drunk.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.291
He wants me
to pick him up.

07:59.291 --> 08:02.792
Oh, I'm sorry
he lost his children.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.291
But can't he take a cab?

08:04.291 --> 08:06.041
Darling.
I know.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.583
But it's 11 o'clock.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.250
Doesn't he have any friends
he can call to pick him up?

08:09.250 --> 08:10.917
I'm his friend.

08:10.917 --> 08:12.041
I am!

08:12.041 --> 08:13.875
You've known him
five minutes.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.291
That doesn't matter.
There was bonding.

08:15.291 --> 08:16.792
We bonded.
You bonded?

08:16.792 --> 08:18.625
Excuse me. Of all
the people in the world,

08:18.625 --> 08:20.542
who did he call
to come pick him up?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.834
I know.
That makes me sad.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.917
You're just jealous
because you haven't made
any friends out here.

08:24.917 --> 08:26.500
That's not true.
All right, who?

08:28.750 --> 08:31.083
Irene.
Who's Irene?

08:31.083 --> 08:32.583
The girl who takes
our script notes.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.041
Noreen.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.834
Oh, who cares?

08:35.834 --> 08:37.667
She can't spell,
and she nicks my mints.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.125
She thinks I don't
see her, but I do.

08:39.125 --> 08:41.000
Give her the evil glare.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.333
Not me. Her.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.250
Anyway,
my actual friend Matt

08:44.250 --> 08:46.417
sounded really depressed,
and he wants my help,
so I'm going.

08:46.417 --> 08:48.333
Fine, then I'm
coming with you.

08:48.333 --> 08:50.000
Oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.875
I don't want you
to go alone.

08:51.875 --> 08:55.458
Besides, you'll never
find this Santa Clarita
on your own.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.625
I've got the
navigation thingy.

08:56.625 --> 08:59.458
Uh, last week,
it sent us to Pasadena.

08:59.458 --> 09:00.959
Yeah, we had fun.

09:00.959 --> 09:04.250
But we didn't want
to go there.

09:08.750 --> 09:11.500
G.P.S. VOICE: Your route
is being calculated.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.166
Turn right
at the next exit.

09:14.166 --> 09:15.458
We're still
in the driveway,

09:15.458 --> 09:17.500
you lying
sack of shit!

09:27.875 --> 09:29.417
Are you sure
this is the place?

09:29.417 --> 09:30.959
Looks like it.

09:30.959 --> 09:32.041
There's Matt's car.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.667
And there's, uh...

09:49.333 --> 09:51.333
Hello.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.083
Hey!

09:53.083 --> 09:55.542
Ohh! You brought her!

09:55.542 --> 09:56.917
And suddenly
the hour to get here

09:56.917 --> 09:58.667
seems totally worth it.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.375
Ah, well, you're here.
Pull up a chair.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.417
What are you guys
having?

10:01.417 --> 10:03.166
Uh, well, no,
we're not--

10:03.166 --> 10:04.750
I don't think we'll--

10:04.750 --> 10:06.417
No, no. Hey,
don't look at her.
Look at me.

10:06.417 --> 10:08.041
Come on, one drink.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.250
One drink!

10:09.250 --> 10:11.208
This place is great.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.083
There's this guy
over there with
only one eye.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.917
He was showing me.
He can go like this...
[Clicks tongue]

10:14.917 --> 10:17.000
...and make the fake one
shoot across the room.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.625
It's insane.
You gotta see it.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.291
I thought you said
he was depressed.

10:20.291 --> 10:22.208
It would really help me
if he was depressed.

10:22.208 --> 10:24.709
Come on, one drink.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.500
Betsy...

10:26.500 --> 10:29.041
Be-e-etsy.
Beverly.

10:29.041 --> 10:32.041
Look, we all have to be on set
by 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.

10:32.041 --> 10:34.375
So, what do you say
we take a rain check
on the drinks...

10:34.375 --> 10:36.417
and the...
shooting eyeball?

10:36.417 --> 10:39.083
Awww! All right.

10:40.375 --> 10:41.750
We just have
to figure out

10:41.750 --> 10:43.041
how to get past
that prick outside.

10:43.041 --> 10:44.417
How did he even
know you were here?

10:44.417 --> 10:45.834
I don't know
how he does it.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.375
That guy is,
like, my nemesis.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.709
Heh. You have
a nemesis?

10:48.709 --> 10:50.625
Why can't I have
a nemesis?

10:50.625 --> 10:52.250
I usually get along
good with those guys.

10:52.250 --> 10:54.291
But that one--whew!

10:54.291 --> 10:56.375
About 10, 12 years ago,

10:56.375 --> 10:58.125
I was coming out
of some club,

10:58.125 --> 11:00.000
I was totally
hammered.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.875
Really?
What must that be like?

11:01.875 --> 11:04.250
Or you could wait
in the car.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.542
Anyway, he got
all in my face

11:06.542 --> 11:08.375
and started
saying stuff,

11:08.375 --> 11:10.875
and I ended up
smashing his camera.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.709
And, uh, his head

11:12.709 --> 11:15.667
may have been involved
in the smashing.

11:15.667 --> 11:17.083
Oh, my God.

11:17.083 --> 11:18.500
Ever since then,

11:18.500 --> 11:19.959
if any kind of shit
happens to me,

11:19.959 --> 11:21.500
that guy's there,
just waiting.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.542
I don't know
how he does it.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.250
It's like
I'm Captain Hook,

11:24.250 --> 11:26.375
and he's the crocodile

11:26.375 --> 11:28.291
following me with
the ticking clock.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.667
[Laughs]
What?

11:32.875 --> 11:35.000
Nothing.
I just don't expect you

11:35.000 --> 11:36.625
to come out with
the Peter Pan  references.

11:36.625 --> 11:39.667
Oh, yeah, I'm fuckin'
full of whimsy!

11:39.667 --> 11:43.083
Also, as a kid, I did
three years on Broadway

11:43.083 --> 11:45.625
as one of the Lost Boys
in Peter Pan,  with...

11:45.625 --> 11:47.291
Sandy Duncan.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.500
You did not!

11:48.500 --> 11:50.375
Did you get to fly?
I flew!

11:50.375 --> 11:52.875
Oh! Ho ho! Why does that
make me so happy?

11:52.875 --> 11:56.250
Hey! Sandy's only got
one eye, too!

11:56.250 --> 11:58.000
It's crazy one-eye day!

11:58.000 --> 12:00.917
If only Sammy Davis, Jr.
were here!

12:00.917 --> 12:03.542
How awesome
would that be?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.959
Right, so...
us leaving.

12:06.959 --> 12:10.166
OK, how about Matt
slips out the back door

12:10.166 --> 12:11.709
and gets into our car,

12:11.709 --> 12:13.667
and we try and distract
the crocodile?

12:13.667 --> 12:15.208
Distract him how?
I don't know.

12:15.208 --> 12:16.834
We'll ask him
to take our picture.

12:16.834 --> 12:17.875
Oh, no, no.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.625
I look like shit.
What'd she say?

12:19.625 --> 12:21.000
She said she looked
like shit.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.625
I'm sorry, I didn't--
What are you doing?

12:23.625 --> 12:25.750
Are you wearing
your pajamas?

12:25.750 --> 12:28.166
I didn't realize we'd be
going somewhere this elegant.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.709
Can we please...

12:29.709 --> 12:31.917
Fine, all right,
let's do this thing.

12:41.583 --> 12:43.083
Wow. Eurgh.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.041
My liver hurts
from that.

12:52.083 --> 12:54.583
SEAN: Excuse me. Hello.
Gentleman with the camera.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.375
Would you mind very much
coming over here

12:56.375 --> 12:58.458
and taking our picture?
What?

12:58.458 --> 13:01.208
I just proposed to
my girlfriend here,

13:01.208 --> 13:03.583
and it would mean
everything to us

13:03.583 --> 13:06.291
to have a memento
of the occasion.

13:06.291 --> 13:07.583
You proposed
just now?

13:07.583 --> 13:09.291
I know.
Can you believe it?

13:09.291 --> 13:12.250
In this horrible bar,
in this awful
neighborhood.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.583
I so didn't
see it coming.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.291
I wanted to throw her
off the scent.

13:16.291 --> 13:17.792
Oh, was I thrown.

13:17.792 --> 13:19.917
What do you say?
Just one picture?

13:19.917 --> 13:21.917
Oh!

13:21.917 --> 13:23.000
I don't--

13:23.000 --> 13:24.875
Oh, please.
We'll pay anything. $100.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.417
200. 300.

13:26.417 --> 13:27.792
100?
Yeah, anything. 100.

13:27.792 --> 13:29.458
I guess I could
mail it to you.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.208
Great!
That'd be brilliant.

13:31.208 --> 13:34.291
Just so I'll
never forget this
magical night.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.166
OK, stand right there.

13:37.166 --> 13:38.792
[Snapping photos]

13:41.041 --> 13:42.834
Psst!

13:42.834 --> 13:44.458
Which one's your car?

13:44.458 --> 13:46.083
[Snapping rapidly]

13:46.083 --> 13:47.667
Ohh, fuck!

13:56.458 --> 13:58.250
Well, at least
he didn't get
any pictures

13:58.250 --> 13:59.834
of you driving
drunk.

14:00.792 --> 14:03.166
Fucking paparazzi.

14:03.166 --> 14:05.125
What kind of kid says,

14:05.125 --> 14:06.834
"When I grow up,

14:06.834 --> 14:08.667
"I want to be
a scumbag asshole

14:08.667 --> 14:11.166
"with a camera,
who just sits around,

14:11.166 --> 14:13.792
"hoping to catch
some celebrity
hitting their nanny,

14:13.792 --> 14:17.041
"or getting a blowjob
from a tranny hooker"?

14:17.041 --> 14:19.166
Maybe if the celebrities
didn't hit their nannies

14:19.166 --> 14:20.959
or get tranny hooker
blow jobs,

14:20.959 --> 14:23.542
then the scumbag arseholes
would be out of a job.

14:23.542 --> 14:25.625
Why is she here?

14:27.208 --> 14:28.333
No.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.250
It's a convertible.
No!

14:30.250 --> 14:32.875
G.P.S. VOICE: Turn right
at the next exit.

14:34.333 --> 14:37.208
Route 134 east.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.500
We're nowhere near the 134.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.333
It's broken.
So, turn it off.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.291
We don't know how.

14:43.291 --> 14:46.000
So far, I'm not
having fun in this car.

14:47.709 --> 14:49.959
Just stay on this
till we get to Sunset

14:49.959 --> 14:53.000
and, uh, I'll tell you
where to go from there.

14:55.792 --> 14:58.291
I'm sorry about
the custody business.

14:58.291 --> 15:00.041
Yeah.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.709
Such bullshit.

15:01.709 --> 15:03.041
What happened?

15:03.041 --> 15:05.000
I got fucked,
is what happened.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.417
I see.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.333
We had this rule

15:11.333 --> 15:13.083
that I wouldn't have
girls over to the house

15:13.083 --> 15:14.709
if the kids
were there.

15:14.709 --> 15:17.375
Also, the nanny
had to be there

15:17.375 --> 15:19.083
whenever they were,
blah, blah, blah.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.417
Whatever.

15:20.417 --> 15:23.750
Anyway, one night,
they were asleep--

15:23.750 --> 15:26.250
they were asleep!

15:26.250 --> 15:27.917
And--

15:27.917 --> 15:30.208
I don't know.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.750
You had a girl over?

15:31.750 --> 15:34.208
No. I didn't
even do that.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.083
The nanny?

15:41.083 --> 15:42.583
She was already
in the house!

15:42.583 --> 15:44.458
That shouldn't
count!

15:44.458 --> 15:48.250
G.P.S. VOICE: Turn next left
onto the bridge.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.792
That thing's an idiot.

15:50.792 --> 15:53.375
No!
Oh, shit. Right.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.917
So, anyway...

15:54.917 --> 15:57.458
one of the boys woke up
and walked in on us.

15:57.458 --> 15:59.542
Oh, my God!

15:59.542 --> 16:01.500
He didn't see anything...

16:01.500 --> 16:03.542
much.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.458
But he told Diane.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.667
And she went nuts.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.625
It was a whole thing.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.667
And Diane is your...

16:11.667 --> 16:13.000
Ex-wife!

16:13.000 --> 16:15.667
Sorry. I haven't seen
this show before.

16:15.667 --> 16:18.500
So, then her
rat-faced lawyer

16:18.500 --> 16:20.500
brings it up
in court today.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.291
Now I only get
to see my kids

16:23.291 --> 16:25.333
every other weekend.

16:25.333 --> 16:28.792
Every other weekend,
just for screwing
the nanny?

16:28.792 --> 16:30.291
She's not even
that hot!

16:30.291 --> 16:31.583
Did you mention that
in court?

16:31.583 --> 16:33.959
'Cause it's a really
good argument.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.083
You think they should've
taken my kids away?

16:42.083 --> 16:44.000
No.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
I just think you might've
contained your libido
long enough

16:46.000 --> 16:47.625
till your children
were out of the house.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.000
At least
I have a libido.
Ow. Ow.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.333
All right, all right.
Ooh. Ow. Ow.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.083
I only
screwed her once.

16:54.083 --> 16:55.709
[Laughs] You only
got caught once.

16:55.709 --> 16:57.208
Clearly you have
enough of a compulsion

16:57.208 --> 16:59.125
that your wife had to
make rules about it.

16:59.125 --> 17:00.667
I don't have a compulsion.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.166
No, of course not.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.166
It was an informed decision
to shag the nanny,

17:04.166 --> 17:06.834
a brilliant plan that could
only end well, obviously.

17:06.834 --> 17:08.333
Hey, you know what?

17:08.333 --> 17:10.000
All right, all right,
that's enough!

17:10.000 --> 17:11.291
One more word
out of either of you

17:11.291 --> 17:13.458
and I'm gonna turn
this car around.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.625
And go where? Back to the bar?
God help us.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.583
I'd go back to the bar.
We're not going
back to the bar.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.500
Who made you the boss
of everything?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.000
SEAN: Oh, bloody hell.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.083
[All arguing]

17:29.792 --> 17:31.041
MATT: Wait, slow down.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.500
That's it there--
right there.

17:36.291 --> 17:37.333
Oh.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.375
See you tomorrow.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.709
You're welcome.

17:46.041 --> 17:49.166
Well, at least
he sobered up.

17:51.333 --> 17:53.041
What's he doing?

17:53.041 --> 17:55.041
[Dog barking]

17:55.041 --> 17:56.792
Are you sure
this is his house?

17:56.792 --> 17:58.166
I don't know.

17:58.166 --> 18:00.333
Doesn't he live
in Malibu?
Yeah.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.709
[Banging on door]

18:01.709 --> 18:03.542
Well, I'm no shitty
navigation system,

18:03.542 --> 18:04.917
but this isn't Malibu.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.917
Maybe Malibu's
just for weekends,

18:06.917 --> 18:08.417
and he lives
somewhere else.

18:08.417 --> 18:10.208
Does he?
I don't know.

18:10.208 --> 18:13.291
You really are
good friends.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.417
Er, Matt, did you
lose your key?

18:18.417 --> 18:20.166
Is this even
your house?

18:20.166 --> 18:23.083
I paid for it.

18:23.083 --> 18:24.917
Oh, Jesus.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.291
I want to see
the boys.

18:26.291 --> 18:27.625
You know
what time it is?

18:27.625 --> 18:28.750
How drunk are you?

18:28.750 --> 18:29.792
I'm fine.

18:29.792 --> 18:32.208
Yeah, right.
I am!

18:32.208 --> 18:34.458
Fine, like you were
at Donna's christening?

18:34.458 --> 18:36.291
I was at Donna's
christening?

18:36.291 --> 18:38.083
You called her
a little fat fuck.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.417
Well...
have you seen her?

18:40.417 --> 18:42.208
Ohh, God, you are
so hammered.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.959
Hope you didn't
drive here.

18:43.959 --> 18:45.583
Uh, no,
that was us.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.291
We're so sorry.
He told us this was
his house.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.166
Like fools,
we believed him.

18:50.166 --> 18:51.625
You're fancy.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.417
MATT:
Tell me about it.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.375
This is Diane.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.417
This is Sean
and Betsy.

18:57.417 --> 18:58.834
Beverly.
Betsy.

18:58.834 --> 19:00.041
Beverly.
Betsy.

19:00.041 --> 19:02.250
It's Beverly.
Who the fuck cares?

19:02.250 --> 19:03.917
DIANE: I'm going back to bed.

19:03.917 --> 19:04.917
You, I'll see
next weekend.

19:04.917 --> 19:06.834
No, wait. I--

19:06.834 --> 19:08.125
I really want
to see them now.

19:08.125 --> 19:10.709
[Sighs] You heard
what the judge said.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.625
Yeah, I heard
what he said.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.750
But come on.

19:14.750 --> 19:17.125
You won today.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.709
Just give me this.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.000
They're asleep.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.375
I'm not gonna
wake them.

19:22.375 --> 19:25.583
I promise. I just
want to look at them.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.417
I need that tonight.

19:29.417 --> 19:31.750
OK?

19:31.750 --> 19:33.792
Come on.

19:35.083 --> 19:38.333
Just once,
don't be a cunt?

19:39.333 --> 19:40.542
All right.

19:40.542 --> 19:42.542
Just this once.

19:42.542 --> 19:44.000
MATT: Thanks.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.375
If you wake them,
I'll break your
fuckin' arms.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.208
Come see my boys.

19:52.041 --> 19:54.333
If we're ever at
some sort of impasse,

19:54.333 --> 19:56.083
and you want
to win me over,

19:56.083 --> 19:58.917
I would avoid
using the phrase,

19:58.917 --> 20:02.667
"Just once,
don't be a cunt."

20:02.667 --> 20:04.959
I think I knew that.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.834
Aren't they gorgeous?

20:16.959 --> 20:18.500
They really are.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.709
I like
the small one.

20:20.709 --> 20:22.750
The big one--
ehh.

20:24.709 --> 20:26.458
I thought that
might be a moment

20:26.458 --> 20:28.083
for a little
humor.

20:28.083 --> 20:30.000
Clearly not.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.625
What are their
names again?

20:31.625 --> 20:32.959
The older one's
Aiden.

20:32.959 --> 20:34.667
The little monster
is Michael.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.542
You see that trophy?

20:36.542 --> 20:39.750
Aiden just won his
school talent contest.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.583
The whole school.

20:41.583 --> 20:43.000
Wow.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.875
Yeah.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.667
He does this thing

20:46.667 --> 20:48.458
where he stacks cups.

20:48.458 --> 20:49.875
Cups?

20:49.875 --> 20:52.417
I know, it sounds stupid.
But you should see him do it.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.083
He's so fast,
the cups are like
a fuckin' blur.

20:55.083 --> 20:57.208
And he won
over everyone
in the school?

20:57.208 --> 20:58.750
Yeah.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.375
Also, the other kids--

21:01.375 --> 21:03.375
not so talented.

21:07.291 --> 21:08.500
Jesus.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.125
What?

21:11.875 --> 21:14.291
Every other weekend?

21:18.417 --> 21:20.959
I'm such an asshole.

21:20.959 --> 21:22.458
Hmm.

21:35.583 --> 21:38.208
Diane seems nice.

21:38.208 --> 21:39.583
Hmm.

21:42.834 --> 21:45.000
I can really see
you two as a couple.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.750
You trying to make me
more depressed?

21:47.750 --> 21:49.500
Sorry.

21:55.583 --> 21:57.583
It was great to
finally see the boys.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.000
Yeah, they're
even more fun

22:01.000 --> 22:03.041
when they're awake.

22:03.041 --> 22:05.625
Well, they're
definitely cuties.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.291
Sure.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.500
Now I gotta go home and
look at their empty rooms.

22:18.667 --> 22:20.291
Christ.

22:22.083 --> 22:24.542
The house gets
so fuckin' quiet.

22:28.083 --> 22:30.333
Why don't you stay
at our place tonight?

22:32.375 --> 22:35.500
Seriously?
You mean that?

22:35.500 --> 22:37.875
Apparently so.

22:39.667 --> 22:41.125
OK.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.875
Well, who saw
that coming?

22:48.667 --> 22:50.291
Hey.

22:52.083 --> 22:55.166
I just want to say,
you know...

22:55.166 --> 22:57.542
thanks.

22:57.542 --> 23:01.667
Not--Not just for
the room, but...

23:01.667 --> 23:03.834
for coming out
to get me tonight.

23:05.500 --> 23:07.542
Oh, well...

23:07.542 --> 23:09.291
you're welcome.

23:09.291 --> 23:11.375
Hello. Just her?
What about me?

23:11.375 --> 23:13.166
Ahh. Heh.

23:14.375 --> 23:16.250
I knew you'd come.

23:18.417 --> 23:20.709
But I wasn't
expecting...

23:20.709 --> 23:22.333
Beverly.

23:25.667 --> 23:27.750
Blurgh!

23:28.834 --> 23:30.834
Uhh.

23:30.834 --> 23:31.875
Ohh.

23:31.875 --> 23:34.041
Oh, sorry.

23:35.834 --> 23:38.250
[Sighs]

23:38.250 --> 23:41.834
[Snoring]

23:41.834 --> 23:44.917
Oh, they grow up
so fast.

23:44.917 --> 23:47.750
SEAN: That was a nice thing
you did there.

23:47.750 --> 23:49.792
I know.

23:49.792 --> 23:52.000
I think he really
appreciated it.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.959
He vomited on me.

23:53.959 --> 23:55.917
Just a little.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.166
Well, I'm just happy

24:00.166 --> 24:03.500
he got to see
how generous...

24:03.500 --> 24:06.500
and wonderful...

24:06.500 --> 24:09.417
and sexy...
[Laughs]

24:09.417 --> 24:11.125
I repeat--

24:11.125 --> 24:13.667
vomited on me.

24:13.667 --> 24:16.208
Yeah, well, maybe not
the last part.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.208
I think this will really
make the difference

24:20.208 --> 24:21.625
between the two of you.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.959
That'd be nice.

24:26.792 --> 24:29.208
[Moans]

24:29.208 --> 24:31.291
I'm so tired.
Hmm.

24:31.291 --> 24:34.333
I could fall asleep
right here.

24:34.333 --> 24:37.000
Maybe a quick
shower first.

24:38.291 --> 24:39.709
The vomit?
Mm-hm.

24:39.709 --> 24:41.000
Mm.

24:51.959 --> 24:53.792
[Clears throat]

24:53.792 --> 24:54.792
Morning.

24:54.792 --> 24:55.834
Hey, Betsy.

24:57.959 --> 24:58.959
Do you want some tea?

24:58.959 --> 25:00.333
Ugh. No.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.750
Any coffee?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.291
Sorry, no. Just tea.

25:03.291 --> 25:06.166
Seriously? No coffee?
No.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.333
In the whole house?
No coffee?
No.

25:08.333 --> 25:09.709
Wow.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.542
It's not like Colombia
not having coffee.

25:15.375 --> 25:17.250
Morning, Florinda.
Morning, miss.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.959
[Gasps]

25:18.959 --> 25:20.458
Joey!

25:20.458 --> 25:22.792
Uh, hey. Hola.

25:22.792 --> 25:26.417
Dios mÃ­o.
Eres tÃº.  Ohh!

25:26.417 --> 25:28.125
How you doin', eh?

25:28.125 --> 25:29.166
Heh. Good one,
good one.

25:29.166 --> 25:31.792
Â¿Esa es un dolor de cabeza?

25:31.792 --> 25:34.125
Ohh. Un gran
dolor de cabeza.

25:34.125 --> 25:35.709
Es imposible.

25:35.709 --> 25:37.208
Florinda has esto,
Florinda has lo otro.

25:37.208 --> 25:39.041
Ooh. Â¿Recuerdo, eh?

25:39.041 --> 25:40.250
SÃ­, claro, claro.

25:40.250 --> 25:41.875
[Both laughing]

25:41.875 --> 25:43.792
What? What did you
just say?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.166
Nothing.

25:45.166 --> 25:47.750
Just, uh...good morning.

25:51.125 --> 25:52.166
Hello, all.

25:53.125 --> 25:54.250
Hey.

25:56.583 --> 25:59.875
What, did something
happen already?

25:59.875 --> 26:02.083
SEAN: And we're off.

26:02.083 --> 26:04.834
Let the awkward
silence begin.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.125
I thought that would
break the tension,

26:08.125 --> 26:10.291
but clearly it just...

26:10.291 --> 26:12.166
shines a light on it.

26:14.417 --> 26:17.667
Hey.
Hey.

26:17.667 --> 26:18.875
BOTH: Hmm.

26:18.875 --> 26:20.834
Oh.

26:20.834 --> 26:23.041
Heh.
This is Kendra.
Hi.

26:23.041 --> 26:24.917
Hello.
Hello.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.500
Heh.

26:26.500 --> 26:28.125
I woke up in the
middle of the night,

26:28.125 --> 26:29.417
totally awake.

26:29.417 --> 26:30.792
You guys
were out cold.

26:30.792 --> 26:32.709
This one snores,
by the way.

26:32.709 --> 26:35.333
You were in our room?

26:35.333 --> 26:37.792
I was really bored.
Anyways,

26:37.792 --> 26:39.250
I called Kendra.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.542
That's not
compulsive at all.

26:40.542 --> 26:42.250
KENDRA: Is there
any coffee?

26:42.250 --> 26:43.917
No. Just tea.

26:43.917 --> 26:46.125
Eww.

26:46.125 --> 26:47.583
So, how do you guys
know Matt?

26:47.583 --> 26:49.041
We're making
a TV pilot with him.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.083
Cool.
And you?

26:51.083 --> 26:52.417
We met at Jamba Juice.

26:52.417 --> 26:54.625
Jamba Juice?

26:54.625 --> 26:56.250
Jamba Juice.

26:56.250 --> 26:59.750
No? Jamba Juice?

26:59.750 --> 27:01.625
Jamba Juice.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.667
Jamba Juice.

27:03.667 --> 27:05.250
Please make them stop
saying "Jamba Juice".

27:05.250 --> 27:07.917
I assume it's some
sort of juice place.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.333
Right. I can't believe
you guys have never
heard of Jamba Juice.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.000
Not until
the last 15 times.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.417
Anyway--What was I
talking about?

27:14.417 --> 27:15.709
Nothing.

27:15.709 --> 27:17.750
Oh. I know.
So, I was getting

27:17.750 --> 27:19.417
one of those
antioxidant smoothies

27:19.417 --> 27:20.750
with a whey protein
super-boost,

27:20.750 --> 27:23.458
and this guy walks in
and hears me ordering,

27:23.458 --> 27:25.083
and he's, like,
"Uh, gross."

27:25.083 --> 27:26.917
And I'm, like,
"Uh, have you even
tried it?"

27:26.917 --> 27:28.625
And he goes,
"I don't need
to try it."

27:28.625 --> 27:32.166
So I say, "Uh, hello?
I think you do."

27:33.458 --> 27:35.542
Anyway, I made him
taste it,

27:35.542 --> 27:37.291
and, before you know it--
blah, blah, blah,

27:37.291 --> 27:38.750
thank you very much--

27:38.750 --> 27:41.458
someone's got
a new favorite drink.

27:43.208 --> 27:45.583
[Smacking lips]

27:48.291 --> 27:49.959
We fuck
once in a while.

27:51.709 --> 27:54.166
Right. I think
we should be

27:54.166 --> 27:56.208
getting to
the studio.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.959
Darling, you
should get ready.
Matt, pants.

27:57.959 --> 28:00.000
And, Kendra, it was
very nice meeting you.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.792
Oh. You, too.

28:01.792 --> 28:04.125
Let's get on
with the day.

28:06.208 --> 28:09.125
Uh...has anyone
seen my dog?

28:12.166 --> 28:13.125
KENDRA: Hmm.
