WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:02.785
Previously onDynasty...

00:02.828 --> 00:04.091
It worked. The judge
has agreed to grant bail

00:04.134 --> 00:07.050
on the condition
of house arrest.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.834
We need to make Liam remember
that he loves me,

00:08.878 --> 00:09.835
not Trashley.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.663
Kirby, listen...Don't say it.

00:11.707 --> 00:12.969
I'm really sorry.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.927
I spoke to the last cop
at Jeff's crime scene.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.755
No one saw a cuff link.
Seems it was missing

00:16.799 --> 00:18.105
before the police
even showed up.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.845
JEFF:
Which means you took it.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.717
You're a selfish,
spoiled little princess.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.979
I hate you!

00:24.807 --> 00:27.244
As your wife, I should have
a say in the family business.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.681
Well, then, congrats
on your promotion.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.248
I will find a way to see Liam.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.858
Laura said that wedding bells

00:32.902 --> 00:34.773
weren't too far off
for Liam and Ashley.

00:40.562 --> 00:42.129
Good morning, Father.

00:42.172 --> 00:45.828
Sure is.
I am on top of the world.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.656
Sun is shining,

00:47.699 --> 00:49.484
I slept with both eyes closed--

00:49.527 --> 00:51.355
mmm-- and this

00:51.399 --> 00:53.531
looks a hell of a lot better
than breakfast in jail.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.707
He's even been humming
all morning.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.100
The same song.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.667
Well, it's because
it's the truth.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.408
Everybody does want
to rule the world.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.019
And some of us
actually do.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.238
I know.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.675
I still have a trial
ahead of me. Mmm.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.633
Well, you don't need to
worry about the winery.

01:08.677 --> 01:11.245
I know last week's incident
was unfortunate,

01:11.288 --> 01:12.463
but nobody is going to

01:12.507 --> 01:14.378
remember Halloween
after tonight's tasting.

01:14.422 --> 01:16.206
The invitations have
already gone out,

01:16.250 --> 01:17.599
including to
the personal sommelier

01:17.642 --> 01:19.122
to the Swedish royal family.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.125
Well, that makes it the
perfect opportunity to introduce

01:22.169 --> 01:24.040
Blue Belt Vineyard's
new copresident.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.042
It has a nice ring to it.

01:27.391 --> 01:28.392
Tell Adam what
you've been thinking.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.133
It's good.

01:30.177 --> 01:31.830
JENNINGS:
I just thought
we could open the doors

01:31.874 --> 01:33.049
a bit, you know?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.703
There's a whole generation
out there

01:34.746 --> 01:36.835
who couldn't care less
about Bordeaux or Napa.

01:36.879 --> 01:39.011
I didn't know we were aiming for
the Two-Buck Chuck demographic.

01:39.055 --> 01:40.578
We're aiming
for the people who know

01:40.622 --> 01:43.233
that fine wine doesn't have
to mean stuffy and traditional.

01:43.277 --> 01:44.843
We need them here tonight.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.323
Now, like I said,
it's a little late

01:46.367 --> 01:47.890
to be sending out
invitations, isn't it?

01:47.933 --> 01:50.066
Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.285
Mm. Already hitting
the ground running.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.952
Somebody's chipper this morning.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.781
Oh, he's not the only one.
Up before 8:30

02:09.825 --> 02:11.392
and working out?

02:11.435 --> 02:13.045
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.222
I'm a professional now.
A hotelier.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.049
A pillar of my community.

02:17.093 --> 02:19.051
Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.Well, speaking of heads,

02:19.095 --> 02:20.270
where are you going
with that fresh blowout?

02:20.314 --> 02:22.794
A, my hair always
looks this good.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.841
And B, I am going
to talk to Liam.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.321
Yeah, but doesn't...

02:27.364 --> 02:29.453
His mother have a restraining
order against me? Yes.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.847
And isn't...He staying at her house?
Also, yes.

02:31.890 --> 02:35.198
But apparently, he and Ashley
are talking about marriage.

02:35.242 --> 02:38.070
And I can't let that happen.
Okay? Not without a fight.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.463
But you have been fighting.
I mean,

02:39.507 --> 02:40.943
don't you remember
the slideshow?

02:40.986 --> 02:42.597
And the sea bass?

02:42.640 --> 02:45.339
What, you're gonna ambush
him with other fish?

02:45.382 --> 02:48.211
I am going to give him this.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.779
The original manuscript
to Liam's book.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.607
With his notes.

02:52.650 --> 02:55.871
There may be nothing I can say
to bring back his memory,

02:55.914 --> 02:58.047
but maybe his own words will.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.310
I mean, it's basically
the story of our relationship.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.834
I know it's a long shot, but
it's the only shot I have left.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.662
Fallon, this isn't
an '80s movie.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.664
You can't just stand outside
his house with a boom box.

03:06.708 --> 03:07.883
Or, you know,

03:07.926 --> 03:09.363
a manuscript.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.495
Maybe I should bring
a boom box, too.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.976
You know, music is
the purest form of expression.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.847
And a restraining order
is the purest form

03:15.891 --> 03:17.414
of "stay the hell away."

03:17.458 --> 03:20.374
Well, you know what? I have
a plan to get around that.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.601
ADAM:
Mrs. Gunnerson.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.690
I didn't know
you were an artist.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.518
What-what is
this masterpiece?

03:34.562 --> 03:35.954
Mrs. Carrington asked me
to make it.

03:35.998 --> 03:38.827
She's added a few invitations
at the last minute,

03:38.870 --> 03:39.958
and she wants them
to be special.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.569
Of course.

03:41.612 --> 03:43.266
And who is this one for?

03:47.662 --> 03:49.185
Thank you.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.708
Caroline Calloway.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.058
She's, uh, one of those...Influencers?

03:53.102 --> 03:54.625
Mm.Yeah, they all are.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.627
And they're all picky eaters.

03:56.671 --> 04:00.457
Look, I know you have
your plate full, literally.

04:00.501 --> 04:04.113
Uh, why don't I take care
of this invitation.

04:04.156 --> 04:07.725
I'll grab a couple of our best
bottles and have them sent out.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.510
That's all right.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.251
Mrs. Carrington asked me
to see to it personally.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.992
No, I insist.

04:14.036 --> 04:15.690
We're all on the same team here,
aren't we?

04:22.914 --> 04:24.655
MONICA:
I'm glad you're back.

04:24.699 --> 04:26.831
Cheers, to the only
family that matters.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.445
What the hell is this?

04:31.488 --> 04:33.534
An apology.What are you doing here?

04:33.577 --> 04:34.970
I thought I told you
to stay away.

04:35.013 --> 04:36.406
Nobody needs to hear
more of your lies.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.887
I know. Which is why I came
to tell you the truth.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.018
The police didn't find

04:40.062 --> 04:41.846
that cuff link
because it wasn't there.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.631
I took it.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.546
Of course you did.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.069
But I did it
for your own good, Jeff.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.549
If Blake would've
found out

04:48.592 --> 04:50.899
what you were doing, he
would have come for you himself.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.118
Then why pretend to help me?
Why let me leave?

04:53.162 --> 04:54.555
You would have escalated the war

04:54.598 --> 04:55.904
until you did
get yourself killed.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.340
Getting you out of Atlanta

04:57.384 --> 04:59.560
was the only way
to keep you safe.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.126
And what the hell
makes you think I needed you

05:01.170 --> 05:02.127
to keep me safe?

05:02.171 --> 05:03.955
You have been gone

05:03.999 --> 05:05.566
for the last
ten years.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.350
Did you really think you could
just swoop into our lives

05:07.394 --> 05:08.743
and decide what's best for us?

05:08.786 --> 05:10.701
I know there were so many times

05:10.745 --> 05:12.790
I wasn't there for you,
both of you.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.576
That's why I was willing to do
anything to protect you now,

05:15.619 --> 05:18.579
why I'm willing to do
anything to make things right.

05:18.622 --> 05:19.754
You really want
to make things right?

05:20.929 --> 05:21.799
Then leave my house.

05:22.757 --> 05:23.975
Now.

05:31.156 --> 05:33.289
RosÃ© all day. Groundbreaking.

06:04.102 --> 06:05.756
Hey, Laura.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.410
Yeah, I guess
you got my message.

06:07.454 --> 06:10.152
: I know it's crazy,
but I heard it with my own ears.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.328
You know how Fallon can be.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.733
BLAKE :
Bo? Here, boy!

06:36.352 --> 06:39.311
Drywall must be
complete by end of day.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.836
This hotel opens
in one week.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.620
Thank you.Looking good.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.056
As are you.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.841
The Italians cut a better suit
than DeKalb County Jail.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.974
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
What Blake did.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.454
Unforgivable.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.413
Thanks. I appreciate that.

06:53.456 --> 06:56.067
And I'm sorry for the way
things turned out with Kirby.

06:56.111 --> 06:57.504
It was just bad timing.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.810
Oh, no need
for apologies, really.

06:59.854 --> 07:02.204
Um, I'm sure you're both
gonna be fine.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.728
You're right.
No need to dwell on the past.

07:04.772 --> 07:08.036
Mm. And what about the future
for Michael Culhane?

07:08.079 --> 07:10.255
Well, I'm back
to running the Atlantix,

07:10.299 --> 07:12.040
and that's actually
why I'm here.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.042
We got a new midfielder
in from Cuba.

07:14.085 --> 07:16.174
Could take the Atlantix
to the next level.

07:16.218 --> 07:17.524
But he's only been here
a few weeks,

07:17.567 --> 07:19.439
and his place got broken into
the other night.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.441
He's kind of shaken up.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.833
I'm sure he is.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.488
Anyway, I figure
a few days' quiet

07:25.532 --> 07:27.055
could do him a lot of good.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.970
I know you guys
are a little ways out

07:29.013 --> 07:31.755
from opening up, but I thought
you might have a room finished.

07:31.799 --> 07:34.454
You do realize
we're not operational yet.

07:34.497 --> 07:36.760
Which is exactly why no one
will be looking for him here.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.588
And I trust you guys.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.982
The team will pay
well above market rate,

07:41.025 --> 07:44.376
and I see no reason
why this place could not be

07:44.420 --> 07:47.336
the official hotel
for the visiting teams.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.338
I-I'll speak to Sam.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.296
I can't think of a better
partnership for the hotel.

07:52.428 --> 07:53.777
GUNNERSON:
Mrs. Carrington.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.606
Just adjusting the menu
to accommodate our new guests.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.173
Thank you.

07:58.216 --> 08:01.219
Though I don't have
RSVPs from any of them.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.656
Did the invitations
go out all right?

08:02.699 --> 08:05.310
Yes. I think so.You think?

08:05.354 --> 08:07.530
Well, I made them
just the way we talked about,

08:07.574 --> 08:09.184
and then
Mr. Carrington took one.

08:09.227 --> 08:10.533
Blake?

08:10.577 --> 08:13.318
No. Mr. Adam.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.756
He was going to pull a few
bottles to send along with them.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.105
Did he not tell you?

08:18.410 --> 08:19.890
He must have forgotten.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.892
I'm sorry, ma'am.It's not your fault.

08:21.936 --> 08:25.026
You're not gonna tell him,
are you? That I told you.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.681
Don't worry. If I've learned
anything from Fallon,

08:27.724 --> 08:29.334
it's not to pick a fight
with Adam.

08:29.378 --> 08:32.207
I just need to keep him busy
until this tasting is over.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.470
JEFF:
So, you said that you'd do

08:34.514 --> 08:36.472
anything
to make things right?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.343
Of course.JEFF: Well, I got something.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.910
The annual Blue Belt
wine tasting is tonight

08:39.954 --> 08:41.216
at Carrington Manor.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.000
Apparently, Adam's running
the vineyard now.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.567
Prodigal son entrusted with

08:44.611 --> 08:46.569
the last remaining jewel
of the Carrington empire.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.745
It's almost Shakespearean.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.921
It's also an opportunity.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.183
What are you talking about?

08:52.227 --> 08:54.011
I want to put the last nail
in the coffin

08:54.055 --> 08:55.230
of Blake's legacy.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.058
His reputation.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.581
I want to make sure
he can never rebuild.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.583
Well, actually, I want you to.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.932
This is exactly
what I meant, Jeff.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.891
You'll never let it go.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.545
Adam and Blake came for my life,

09:05.588 --> 09:08.025
so now I'm coming for theirs,
in a manner of speaking.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.636
And if you're really Team Colby,

09:09.679 --> 09:12.247
you'll help me.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.640
: I knew
she wouldn't do it.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.860
What do you want me to do?

09:18.906 --> 09:20.560
Get into the manor
and make sure that tasting

09:20.603 --> 09:21.996
is Blue Belt's last.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.911
And then what?
Set the house on fire?

09:23.954 --> 09:25.129
Oaky, don't be melodramatic.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.044
I don't want you
burning down the house.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.873
I just want Adam to get a little
taste of his own medicine.

09:34.356 --> 09:35.879
Oh.

09:38.273 --> 09:41.145
That's inconvenient.

09:41.189 --> 09:44.888
Liam, you better be in here
and you better be alone.

09:44.932 --> 09:46.498
Open the door.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.676
Liam?

09:49.719 --> 09:52.679
Fallon? What are you doing here?

09:52.722 --> 09:55.856
If you remembered me, this
really wouldn't surprise you.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.640
And you should know

09:57.684 --> 10:00.295
that I almost brought a boom
box, but more importantly...

10:00.338 --> 10:02.602
...I brought this.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.300
It's your book, about us.

10:05.343 --> 10:08.172
Oh, there must be a copy
here somewhere.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.174
No, no. I mean,
not the original manuscript,

10:10.218 --> 10:12.394
with your original notes,
inside jokes,

10:12.437 --> 10:14.004
and conversations
we had. I just--

10:14.048 --> 10:15.658
I really, really need you
to read it

10:15.702 --> 10:17.138
before you do
something crazy, because...

10:17.181 --> 10:18.139
MAN:
Freeze!

10:20.097 --> 10:22.665
Hurry. Just take it.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.189
No.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.108
I think Adam may be
a little shaken up

10:31.152 --> 10:32.544
with this whole
winery situation.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.111
What do you mean?

10:34.155 --> 10:35.983
He's had some trouble
finding his footing.

10:36.026 --> 10:37.680
First he had to leave
the soccer team,

10:37.724 --> 10:39.682
and now he's feeling
pushed out of Blue Belt.

10:39.726 --> 10:40.770
I didn't fire him.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.293
I know that,

10:42.337 --> 10:44.513
but you saw how he reacted
at breakfast.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.689
He's insecure.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.691
I think he needs a reminder
that your relationship

10:48.735 --> 10:49.953
is bigger than business.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.914
You are right. Of course.

10:53.957 --> 10:55.829
The two of you could
spend the day together.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.135
Just father and son.
No business allowed.

11:00.181 --> 11:02.574
This reeks of excessive force.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.228
Ma'am, we're private security.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.447
And I haven't
touched you.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.667
You can still expect
a civil suit.
Mm.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.411
So maybe you should
lawyer up.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.239
LAURA:
When I got a tip

11:15.283 --> 11:17.285
that there was an intruder
on the property,

11:17.328 --> 11:19.722
I wondered whether
you were crazy enough

11:19.766 --> 11:21.637
to come here;
a mother's intuition,

11:21.681 --> 11:23.247
that never fails.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.423
The only reason I'm
not calling the police

11:25.467 --> 11:27.774
is because I do not want
to ruin Liam's special day.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.863
Special day?

11:29.906 --> 11:31.908
That's right.

11:31.952 --> 11:33.997
These last
few weeks have

11:34.041 --> 11:36.043
really put things
into perspective.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.958
And when it's true love,
why wait?

11:38.001 --> 11:39.307
So Ashley and Liam

11:39.350 --> 11:41.831
have decided to skip
all the accoutrement

11:41.875 --> 11:43.920
and just go straight to
the courthouse this afternoon.

11:43.964 --> 11:46.488
Ourcourthouse?

11:48.533 --> 11:51.058
You're even more unbalanced
than I thought.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.973
And I'm warning you,
if you step foot

11:53.016 --> 11:54.626
near that courthouse,
you'll lose a lot more than

11:54.670 --> 11:56.716
the one ounce of dignity
you have left.

12:03.244 --> 12:06.813
She thinks that this is a game,
that her son is...

12:06.856 --> 12:09.772
not a real person
with a real fiancÃ©e.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.122
Hey, are you
listening to me?Not really.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.385
Anders was just
texting me 'cause

12:14.429 --> 12:15.822
I was supposed to be
at the hotel

12:15.865 --> 12:18.259
half an hour ago, and Culhane--

12:18.302 --> 12:20.914
Never mind. I am listening.
You wanted to play a game?

12:20.957 --> 12:23.394
There is no game.
This is a war.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.309
I have to get
that manuscript to Liam.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.789
I'm sorry, did we just

12:26.833 --> 12:28.399
travel back in time
to this morning?

12:28.443 --> 12:30.445
Fallon, you've already
tried your Hail Mary.

12:30.488 --> 12:31.925
It's over, honey.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.057
It's not over until that
manuscript is in Liam's hands.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.493
You can't go back there.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.669
You're right.
Yeah.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.497
They will be
looking for me,

12:39.541 --> 12:41.717
but they won't be
looking for you.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.024
Oh, no.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.461
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm already late for work.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.811
What? Sam, you can't be late.
You're the boss.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.726
Plus, Laura doesn't
even know you.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.032
You're the perfect
Trojan horse.

12:52.075 --> 12:54.164
All you have to do is
get onto the property,

12:54.208 --> 12:55.687
grab that manuscript
and give it to Liam

12:55.731 --> 12:56.819
before he heads
to the courthouse.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.039
But I've never even
seen this place.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.389
Oh, that's fine.
I'll talk you through it.
It'll be really easy.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.478
I'll be your Cyrano de Bergerac,
just with a much better nose.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.046
Why do I have to be the horse?

13:06.089 --> 13:08.222
Just go get ready, okay?
We don't have all day.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.571
Fine.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.834
It smells weird in here, anyway.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.194
You take requests?

13:24.238 --> 13:25.717
I was rehearsing
a little Beethoven

13:25.761 --> 13:27.850
for the party tonight.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.417
Though I don't think
it's that kind of party anymore.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.505
What do you mean?

13:32.289 --> 13:36.903
I think Cristal's new vision
is a little trendier,

13:36.946 --> 13:38.208
judging by the
guest list.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.645
I mean, do you know
any of these people?

13:40.689 --> 13:43.170
Yeah. The Carters, right there.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.781
Yeah, that's not Jimmy and
Rosalynn, that's BeyoncÃ©.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.391
Oh.And she sends her regrets.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.828
Okay.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.438
Hey, let's give her
a chance, huh?

13:51.569 --> 13:52.832
Cristal, not BeyoncÃ©.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.748
Besides, Tears For Fears is
a little more my style anyway.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.141
Yes.

13:58.185 --> 13:59.926
I remember when
that song came out.

13:59.969 --> 14:02.798
I was younger than you.
My hair was a little longer.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.321
I think that was called
a mullet.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.454
Well, you should've
seen my moves back then.

14:06.497 --> 14:07.759
Yeah?Few too many of these,

14:07.803 --> 14:08.804
you just might.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.154
You little rat!

14:11.198 --> 14:12.721
Hey!

14:12.764 --> 14:14.201
That was good Scotch.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.116
You called in that tip
to Laura Van Kirk, didn't you?

14:16.159 --> 14:17.682
And if you think
that's the only tip

14:17.726 --> 14:18.901
she's gotten from him...Oh.

14:18.945 --> 14:19.989
I don't know what
you're talking about.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.425
And I don't think
I want to know.

14:21.469 --> 14:23.123
I just needed five minutes
with my fiancÃ©.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.385
Instead, I almost got arrested

14:24.428 --> 14:26.691
because you are sleeping
with Mrs. Robinson.

14:26.735 --> 14:28.084
Well, you violated
a restraining order.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.564
I'm not sure I'm
the crazy one here.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.348
Well, I'm not the one
who tried to change Mom's face.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.915
Kids, stop it, both of you!

14:32.959 --> 14:33.960
We have enough battles
to fight

14:34.003 --> 14:35.352
without turning on
each other, too.

14:35.396 --> 14:38.616
Well, tell that
to Dr. Frankenstein.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.750
Is that the Whitesnake record
you gave me?

14:41.793 --> 14:45.145
Yeah. I was feeling a bit
nostalgic for my 20s.

14:45.188 --> 14:48.322
I wanted to share some good,
classic music with Adam.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.498
But why? We were doing
just fine without him.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.848
Why can't we go back to that?

14:55.982 --> 14:59.942
âª Welcome to your life

14:59.986 --> 15:02.814
âª There's no turning back

15:04.686 --> 15:08.777
âª Even while we sleep

15:08.820 --> 15:10.997
âª We will find you

15:11.040 --> 15:15.175
âª Acting on your best behavior

15:15.218 --> 15:19.919
âª Turn your back
on Mother Nature âª

15:19.962 --> 15:25.185
âª Everybody wants
to rule the world âª

15:30.842 --> 15:34.716
âª It's my own desire

15:34.759 --> 15:37.240
âª It's my own remorse

15:37.284 --> 15:38.807
No.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.156
âª Help me

15:40.200 --> 15:42.985
âª To decide

15:43.029 --> 15:47.337
âª Help me make the most
of freedom âª

15:47.381 --> 15:49.426
âª And of pleasure

15:49.470 --> 15:54.127
âª Nothing ever lasts forever

15:54.170 --> 15:57.434
âª Everybody wants
to rule the world âª

15:57.478 --> 15:59.088
Not funny.

15:59.132 --> 16:02.613
âª There's a room where
the light won't find you âª

16:02.657 --> 16:07.009
âª Holding hands while
the walls come tumbling down âª

16:07.053 --> 16:08.924
No.âª When they do

16:08.968 --> 16:11.100
âª I'll be right behind you

16:11.144 --> 16:15.322
âª So glad we've almost made it

16:15.365 --> 16:19.761
âª So sad they had to fade it

16:19.804 --> 16:25.071
âª Everybody wants
to rule the world. âª

16:27.116 --> 16:28.465
What was that?

16:28.509 --> 16:30.685
Okay, you guys are like
Boyz II Men.

16:30.728 --> 16:31.991
Or is it Men to Boys?

16:32.034 --> 16:33.557
You were a little pitchy
on the second verse.

16:33.601 --> 16:34.558
What verse?

16:34.602 --> 16:36.778
When you were singing.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.040
Just now?

16:38.084 --> 16:41.043
Uh, nobody was singing, Fallon.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.436
Are you feeling okay?

16:42.479 --> 16:45.178
No.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.006
Not anymore.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.103
MICHAEL:
All right, you'll be in 304.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.408
They're still working
on the elevator,

16:58.452 --> 16:59.888
but the stairs
are right there.

16:59.931 --> 17:01.455
And since room service
isn't up and running,

17:01.498 --> 17:02.934
let's get you
a few extra bottles of water

17:02.978 --> 17:04.327
before we head up.Michael?

17:05.807 --> 17:08.244
Kirby. Hey.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.029
What are you doing here?
Are you here to see me?

17:10.072 --> 17:12.074
I'm actually here on business.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.250
What kind of business?

17:14.294 --> 17:16.905
I can't really
talk about it.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.777
I should really be going.

17:19.821 --> 17:21.562
But I hope
everything is good with you.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.564
Just fine.

17:23.607 --> 17:24.826
Let's go.

17:30.571 --> 17:32.529
BLAKE:
How's it going with
the wine tasting?

17:32.573 --> 17:35.010
There was a little mishap
with the invitations today,

17:35.054 --> 17:36.055
but it's all
sorted out now.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.708
I called the guests myself.

17:37.752 --> 17:40.102
Yeah, speaking of
the invitations,

17:40.146 --> 17:42.409
I didn't recognize most
of the names on the guest list.

17:42.452 --> 17:45.107
Let me guess: Adam showed you?

17:45.151 --> 17:47.327
I know you're trying
to pull in a new audience,

17:47.370 --> 17:48.893
but I didn't realize it was
at the expense of the old one.

17:48.937 --> 17:51.287
What about my friends?

17:51.331 --> 17:53.463
Those people aren't going
to keep Blue Belt in business.

17:53.507 --> 17:54.856
After we talked,

17:54.899 --> 17:56.292
I looked at
the vineyard's books.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.598
Sales have

17:57.641 --> 17:59.252
all but evaporated
since Mack and Trixie.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.036
And you didn't
say anything?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.516
I didn't want to
distract you.

18:02.559 --> 18:04.866
It would be a bigger distraction
if my winery went under,

18:04.909 --> 18:05.780
don't you think?

18:05.823 --> 18:07.129
It's all we have left.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.391
Which is why

18:08.435 --> 18:10.959
we need to cultivate
this new customer base.

18:11.002 --> 18:13.135
That's how we're

18:13.179 --> 18:15.137
going to rebuild
the entire Carrington empire.

18:21.622 --> 18:22.623
Good afternoon.

18:22.666 --> 18:24.668
Yeah. How can I help?

18:24.712 --> 18:26.975
I have a delivery from Petals
on Ponce for Mr. Liam Ridley.

18:27.018 --> 18:28.542
Oh, no problem. I'll take those.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.283
Uh, uh, is Mr. Ridley here?

18:30.326 --> 18:31.458
Because I have
specific instructions

18:31.501 --> 18:32.850
to deliver them directly to him.

18:32.894 --> 18:33.895
They're for today's event.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.332
And who's the sender?

18:36.376 --> 18:39.379
Oh, it's Miss Ashley Cunningham.
The bride.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.210
Of course.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.473
Go on through. Someone will
meet you at the front door.

18:46.516 --> 18:47.822
Gracias.

18:47.865 --> 18:49.606
Okay, I'm through the gate.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.523
FALLON :
Now the real mission begins.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.403
There you are.
I was waiting for you.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.100
I thought we should
try the product first

19:05.144 --> 19:06.319
before everyone else
does tonight.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.972
I've been talking with Cristal.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.365
She says wine sales

19:09.409 --> 19:10.888
were basically nonexistent
this month.

19:10.932 --> 19:12.325
Why didn't you say anything?

19:12.368 --> 19:15.980
Well, you know,
it's just a passing phase.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.113
Once the new cycle moves on,

19:18.157 --> 19:19.984
everyone will forget
about the scandals

19:20.028 --> 19:21.725
and remember how much
they love Blue Belt wine.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.511
Starting tonight, I hope.

19:24.554 --> 19:25.599
I'll toast to that.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.383
Want to do the honors?What'd you pick?

19:31.779 --> 19:33.955
What the hell is this?

19:33.998 --> 19:35.174
What?

19:37.524 --> 19:39.526
Oh, I think it's Cristal.Yeah, I know it's Cristal.

19:39.569 --> 19:40.875
What is her face doing
on this wine bottle?

19:40.918 --> 19:42.790
Don't ask me.
Didn't she talk to you about it?

19:42.833 --> 19:44.357
About taking me off
my own label? No.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.446
We didn't talk about this.Wow.

19:46.489 --> 19:48.361
First your friends,
now your face.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.971
If I didn't know
any better, I'd think

19:50.014 --> 19:51.364
she was trying
to erase you from Blue Belt.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.192
JENNINGS:
He said I made those?

19:53.235 --> 19:56.064
Well, that's your face,
isn't it?

19:56.107 --> 19:57.805
Yes, it's my face.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.546
Same as the day we met.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.634
But I have never seen
that label before

20:00.677 --> 20:02.549
in my life.

20:02.592 --> 20:05.247
This is obviously
Adam trying to embarrass me.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.466
I told you this morning,

20:06.509 --> 20:08.381
he doesn't want me
involved in the winery.

20:08.424 --> 20:11.035
Then why would he put
your face on the label?

20:11.079 --> 20:13.081
For the same reason
he showed you that guest list.

20:13.124 --> 20:15.344
To make it look like I'm trying
to take over the company.

20:15.388 --> 20:17.216
Are you?

20:17.259 --> 20:18.956
Adam didn't make
that new guest list. You did.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.481
But only because I...

20:21.524 --> 20:22.786
'Cause I'm a liability
right now?

20:22.830 --> 20:25.093
Blake, you are under
a lot of stress...

20:25.136 --> 20:27.182
Yeah, this is not helping!

20:30.359 --> 20:32.318
Liam's bedroom
is around the back.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.929
First floor, on the corner.

20:34.972 --> 20:36.365
And the manuscript should be
right under his balcony.

20:42.458 --> 20:43.633
Did you find it?

20:43.677 --> 20:45.026
Not yet.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.157
Did you find it now?

20:47.594 --> 20:49.204
Wait, I see it.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.989
It's way under there, though.
I don't know if I can reach it.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.165
Okay, I climbed that building
in heels, Sam.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.211
Suck it up.

21:01.172 --> 21:02.652
There are thorns everywhere.

21:02.696 --> 21:03.740
Got it.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.657
You owe me a facial.

21:13.707 --> 21:16.187
That little troll.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.843
CULHANE:
Here we are.

21:19.887 --> 21:23.543
Home, for the next
few days at least.

21:23.586 --> 21:24.979
Thank you.

21:25.022 --> 21:27.155
This is... it's great.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.244
Well, the team is a family;
that's what family does.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.767
You got my number
if you need me,

21:30.811 --> 21:32.769
and I'll be sure to have
my office reach out to you...

21:32.813 --> 21:35.729
No. Don't.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.252
Well, it'd just be easier if you
can't get in contact with me.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.341
It's safer if no one knows.

21:39.385 --> 21:40.908
I know you're shaken up
by what happened,

21:40.951 --> 21:42.344
but the police will find
whoever broke in.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.041
I already know who it was.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.913
What? Who?

21:48.394 --> 21:51.179
Things in Cuba were... bad.

21:51.222 --> 21:53.573
It wasn't safe.

21:53.616 --> 21:56.793
I was trying to get out for
a long time, and I needed help.

21:56.837 --> 21:59.796
And these guys,
that's what they do.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.451
They're very expensive,
and I didn't have the money.

22:02.495 --> 22:04.366
What do they want?To get paid.

22:04.410 --> 22:06.542
And did you pay them?Yes.

22:06.586 --> 22:09.110
But now they want more,
and every time I say no, they...

22:09.153 --> 22:11.068
They sent you a message.No one should know I'm here.

22:11.112 --> 22:13.375
You're telling me.

22:13.419 --> 22:16.639
She said she'd never seen
those labels before,

22:16.683 --> 22:18.162
that you must've made them.When?

22:18.206 --> 22:20.730
I've been with you
most of the day.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.210
Why would I put Cristal's face
on anything?

22:22.253 --> 22:23.516
I asked her the same thing.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.647
She said that you want her
out of the winery.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.910
I want what's best
for the winery,

22:26.954 --> 22:29.391
which is why I managed to find
some of the old labels.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.827
We'll switch them out
before tonight.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.394
No. This whole thing
was a mistake.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.614
I thought it would bring
the family closer together.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.311
It's caused nothing but strife.
I'm canceling the tasting.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.791
No, no, you can't do that.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.793
Look, I don't know
what's happening with Cristal,

22:39.836 --> 22:42.273
but it's not about her tonight;
it's about your winery.

22:42.317 --> 22:43.492
Everything's
already in motion.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.015
We may as well just
make the best of it.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.409
I'll-I'll call Bob Channing
and the Carters.

22:49.193 --> 22:50.412
Just give me a chance.

22:52.109 --> 22:53.197
Fine.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.504
All right. You won't regret it.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.986
Dominique.

22:59.029 --> 23:01.423
What a surprise.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.512
Don't worry, I'm not here
for your little wine party.

23:03.556 --> 23:05.688
I'm sure my invitation
was lost in the mail.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.951
Yeah, I'll go check on that.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.259
So what are you
doing here, hmm?

23:11.302 --> 23:12.521
Haven't seen enough
of me lately?

23:12.565 --> 23:14.610
Or did you already
go through that million?

23:14.654 --> 23:17.439
I'm here to ask for your word
that you'll leave Jeff alone.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.572
Oh, really?

23:19.615 --> 23:22.444
'Cause I seem to recall
you giving me your word

23:22.488 --> 23:23.837
that he'd be
out of my hair.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.621
All of a sudden,
he's back in Atlanta.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.797
I said I would handle it,
and I will.

23:27.841 --> 23:30.496
Nothing needs to change,
including my payments.

23:30.539 --> 23:31.758
So are we good?

23:34.325 --> 23:36.153
Luckily for you,
I've got my hands full

23:36.197 --> 23:37.720
with these
Georgia state prosecutors

23:37.764 --> 23:40.723
right now, so, yeah, I'll
stand down as long as he does.

23:40.767 --> 23:41.768
You can
see yourself out.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.467
FALLON :
Okay, when you get in,

23:45.511 --> 23:47.338
you should see
a tacky spiral staircase.

23:47.382 --> 23:48.383
You want to go left there

23:48.427 --> 23:50.124
and then down that hall.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.779
You're gonna walk by, like,
four big oil portraits of Laura,

23:52.822 --> 23:54.650
which seems a little
on the nose to me, but...

23:54.694 --> 23:56.609
Uh, can we save
the running commentary?

23:56.652 --> 23:58.132
Okay, so left at the staircase.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.655
Uh, right.

23:59.699 --> 24:01.091
You said left.

24:01.135 --> 24:02.702
FALLON: No, no, no, no.
Yeah, but it actually...

24:02.745 --> 24:04.965
it actually is a right.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.749
Are you trying to confuse me?

24:06.793 --> 24:08.185
No, no.
Okay, I have a headache.

24:08.229 --> 24:09.622
I mean, it must be
from all this stress.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.754
You're stressed?
I'm the one trespassing

24:11.798 --> 24:13.539
in a stranger's home
wearing a polo shirt.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.239
Can I help you?

25:03.589 --> 25:04.764
SAM:
Ma'am,

25:04.807 --> 25:06.548
like I told the guard,

25:06.592 --> 25:09.333
I specific instructions
to hand deliver these

25:09.377 --> 25:10.683
directly to Mr. Ridley.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.380
I will sign for them
and make sure

25:12.423 --> 25:13.686
he gets them.SAM: No, no, no.

25:13.729 --> 25:15.775
But isn't that
technically fraud, hmm?

25:15.818 --> 25:18.125
If my boss finds out,
I could get fired.

25:18.168 --> 25:21.345
I am sure you can understand,
as a fellow employee.

25:21.389 --> 25:22.956
Yes, and I'm sure you understand

25:22.999 --> 25:24.784
that I can't just let a stranger
waltz into the house.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.089
We've already had
a security breach today.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.351
My bad.

25:27.395 --> 25:28.744
Yeah. Thanks a lot.Pardon me?

25:30.398 --> 25:32.443
I was just, um...

25:32.487 --> 25:35.751
I was saying a little prayer
for my... cat.

25:35.795 --> 25:37.100
Really? Your cat?

25:37.144 --> 25:38.841
She's very sick,

25:38.885 --> 25:42.366
and the medicine
are very expensive.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.977
And that's why
I really,

25:44.020 --> 25:45.544
really, really have to
keep this job.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.589
So if you would just please
show me to Mr. Ridley.

25:47.633 --> 25:48.721
Please.What about Mr. Ridley?

25:50.070 --> 25:51.898
No, no!Here you go.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.377
Liam.

25:53.421 --> 25:55.292
Liam?

25:55.336 --> 25:56.380
You look great.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.991
LIAM:
I'm sorry.

25:58.034 --> 26:00.602
My memory's not what it
used to be. Have-have we met?

26:00.646 --> 26:03.170
It's just me, Sam,
arguably Fallon's best friend.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.651
Fallon Carrington?Just give him the book, Sam!

26:05.694 --> 26:07.478
She tried to give you
this earlier.

26:07.522 --> 26:10.220
It's your book about her.
If you just read it,

26:10.264 --> 26:12.222
you might remember the truth,
that you guys are in love.

26:12.266 --> 26:13.746
I'm getting security.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.053
LIAM:
I'm-I'm really flattered,

26:17.097 --> 26:19.490
but I'm on kind of
a tight schedule at the moment.

26:19.534 --> 26:21.449
I'm getting married today.Just let me talk to Liam.

26:21.492 --> 26:24.104
Uh, this is Fallon.
She's on the phone.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.541
Okay, Fallon,
you're on speaker.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.804
And security is probably
on their way,

26:28.848 --> 26:30.937
so skip the small talk.FALLON: Liam,

26:30.980 --> 26:32.547
I know this is crazy,

26:32.591 --> 26:34.549
and I know that you're supposed
to be getting married today,

26:34.593 --> 26:35.811
but that is why I really,

26:35.855 --> 26:37.770
really need you
to read this book first,

26:37.813 --> 26:39.206
because even if
you can't remember yet,

26:39.249 --> 26:41.338
what we had was magical.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.079
It was epic, even.

26:43.123 --> 26:44.472
And I know
I can't just forget it.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.126
Oh, that's beautiful.

26:46.169 --> 26:49.564
âª How can I just
let you walk away âª

26:49.608 --> 26:54.090
âª Just let you leave
without a trace âª

26:54.134 --> 26:55.875
âª When I stand here

26:55.918 --> 27:00.183
âª Taking every breath with you

27:00.227 --> 27:02.533
âª Ooh, ooh

27:02.577 --> 27:06.146
âª You're the only one
who really knew me âª

27:06.189 --> 27:08.409
âª At all

27:08.452 --> 27:10.890
Okay. She's had a bit of a day.

27:10.933 --> 27:14.676
âª How can you just
walk away from me âª

27:14.720 --> 27:18.854
âª When all I can do
is watch you leave âª

27:18.898 --> 27:23.119
âª 'Cause we shared
the laughter and the pain âª

27:23.163 --> 27:26.775
âª And even shared the tears

27:26.819 --> 27:28.603
âª You're the only one

27:28.647 --> 27:31.780
âª Who really knew me at all

27:31.824 --> 27:34.217
I won't take that personally.

27:34.261 --> 27:38.265
âª So take a look at me now

27:38.308 --> 27:42.791
âª Well, there's just
an empty space âª

27:42.835 --> 27:45.402
âª And there's nothing
left here âª

27:45.446 --> 27:47.274
âª To remind me

27:47.317 --> 27:50.625
âª Just the memory of your face

27:50.669 --> 27:54.934
âª Take a look at me now

27:54.977 --> 27:58.677
âª Well, there's just
an empty space âª

27:58.720 --> 28:01.592
âª And you coming back to me

28:01.636 --> 28:03.812
âª Is against the odds

28:03.856 --> 28:09.383
âª But it's what
I've got to face... âª

28:09.426 --> 28:12.299
Okay then, um...

28:14.649 --> 28:18.740
âª I wish I could just
make you turn around âª

28:18.784 --> 28:22.657
âª Turn around and see me cry

28:22.701 --> 28:26.443
âª There's so much
I need to say to you âª

28:26.487 --> 28:30.970
âª So many reasons why

28:31.013 --> 28:34.930
âª You're the only one
who really knew me at all âª

28:34.974 --> 28:37.324
You have a great voice.Thank you.

28:37.367 --> 28:40.588
âª So take a look at me now

28:42.459 --> 28:45.636
âª There's just an empty space

28:45.680 --> 28:48.291
âª And there's nothing
left here... âª

28:48.335 --> 28:50.641
And that's all the time we have.

28:50.685 --> 28:51.555
Uh, Liam, it was
great seeing you.

28:51.599 --> 28:54.471
Fallon, that was special.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.256
Wait, I'm not done.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.440
Caroline. Adam Carrington,
co-president of Blue Belt.

29:06.483 --> 29:07.441
This is Bob. Bob.

29:07.484 --> 29:08.790
Uh-huh?This is Caroline.

29:08.834 --> 29:10.661
I think you two
have a lot in common.

29:10.705 --> 29:13.664
See? We got this.Yeah, I hope you're right.

29:13.708 --> 29:16.929
Wouldn't be a wine tasting
without the wine, would it?

29:16.972 --> 29:18.147
I didn't think
you'd be joining us.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.802
Yes. Sorry I'm late.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.717
Just had to make
a few final adjustments.

29:25.111 --> 29:27.156
Maybe you'd like
to do the honors?

29:31.900 --> 29:32.858
BLAKE:
Who did this?

29:32.901 --> 29:34.555
I commissioned them

29:34.598 --> 29:36.818
after our first conversation
about the winery,

29:36.862 --> 29:38.515
when you told me

29:38.559 --> 29:40.300
about the hummingbird
that flew by

29:40.343 --> 29:42.389
when you were signing
to buy the property,

29:42.432 --> 29:44.739
and how you thought
it must be a good omen.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.262
Or the bluebells

29:46.306 --> 29:50.440
that grow
all over the vineyard,

29:50.484 --> 29:52.355
and how Fallon used to pick them
to make bouquets

29:52.399 --> 29:54.096
when she was
a little girl,

29:54.140 --> 29:56.577
how it was the first place
you ever drove a tractor.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.319
And the last.

29:59.362 --> 30:02.365
You remembered all that?Of course.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.237
I'm sorry I ever
made you feel

30:04.280 --> 30:06.195
like I'd forgotten you
in all of this.

30:06.239 --> 30:09.851
You are the heart and soul
of Blue Belt.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.071
That's why I want
to be a part of it,

30:12.114 --> 30:14.116
because of you.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.514
Well, I'll toast to that.

30:27.608 --> 30:28.827
FALLON:
There you are.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.872
I can't believe
you hung up on me.

30:30.916 --> 30:32.004
What is the matter with you?

30:32.047 --> 30:33.483
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

30:33.527 --> 30:35.572
You burst into song
on the phone, Fallon.

30:35.616 --> 30:38.880
And it really does smell weird
in here, kind of like cheese.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.708
So I sang, okay?

30:40.751 --> 30:43.406
I told you, music is the
purest form of expression.

30:43.450 --> 30:45.669
And he took the book, right?Yeah, he did.

30:45.713 --> 30:48.150
Do you think he'll read it?
I mean, did he seem interested?

30:48.194 --> 30:49.456
Should I text him?
Maybe I'll text him.

30:49.499 --> 30:51.850
Fallon, we broke into
his house twice.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.634
Okay? I'd let it breathe.

30:53.677 --> 30:56.419
For how long?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.249
âª You can't hurry love

31:00.293 --> 31:03.252
âª No, you'll just
have to wait, she said âª

31:03.296 --> 31:05.341
âª Love don't come easy

31:05.385 --> 31:08.692
âª But it's a game
of give and take âª

31:08.736 --> 31:10.694
âª You can't hurry love No.

31:10.738 --> 31:12.740
âª No, you'll just have to wait

31:12.783 --> 31:14.698
âª Just trust in a good time

31:14.742 --> 31:17.919
âª No matter how long it takes

31:17.963 --> 31:21.967
âª But how many heartaches
must I stand âª

31:22.010 --> 31:24.012
âª Before I find the love

31:24.056 --> 31:26.449
âª To let me live again

31:26.493 --> 31:28.712
âª Right now the only thing

31:28.756 --> 31:31.933
âª That keeps me
hanging on âª

31:31.977 --> 31:33.892
âª When I feel my strength

31:33.935 --> 31:35.284
âª Oh, no, it's almost gone

31:35.328 --> 31:37.112
âª I remember Mama said

31:37.156 --> 31:38.809
âª You can't hurry love

31:38.853 --> 31:41.290
âª No, you'll just
have to wait âª

31:41.334 --> 31:44.032
âª She said love
don't come easy âª

31:44.076 --> 31:46.252
âª But it's a game
of give and take âª

31:46.295 --> 31:48.210
âª How long must I wait?

31:48.254 --> 31:51.213
âª Ooh, how much more
must I take? âª

31:51.257 --> 31:55.826
âª Before loneliness will cause
my heart, heart to break? âª

31:55.870 --> 31:59.961
âª Now I can't bear
to live my life alone âª

32:00.005 --> 32:03.269
âª I grow impatient for a love

32:03.312 --> 32:05.010
âª To call my own

32:05.053 --> 32:07.012
âª But when I feel that I

32:07.055 --> 32:10.015
âª No, I can't go on

32:10.058 --> 32:12.365
âª Well, these
precious words âª

32:12.408 --> 32:13.975
âª Keep me hanging on

32:14.019 --> 32:15.063
âª I remember Mama said

32:15.107 --> 32:17.326
âª You can't hurry love

32:17.370 --> 32:19.589
âª No, you'll just have to wait

32:19.633 --> 32:22.810
âª She said
love don't come easy âª

32:22.853 --> 32:24.855
âª It's a game of give and take

32:24.899 --> 32:26.814
âª You can't hurry love

32:26.857 --> 32:29.164
âª No, you'll just have to wait

32:29.208 --> 32:32.602
âª Just trust in a good time

32:32.646 --> 32:33.995
âª No matter how long it takes

32:35.518 --> 32:37.651
Well... I guess
The Supremes were right.

32:37.694 --> 32:39.566
Huh?

32:39.609 --> 32:41.481
The song.
You were just singing.

32:41.524 --> 32:43.483
"You Can't Hurry Love."
It's by The Supremes.

32:43.526 --> 32:44.919
I always thought
that was Phil Collins,

32:44.963 --> 32:46.094
but I wasn't singing.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.010
Are you sure you're okay?

32:49.054 --> 32:51.970
Honestly? No.

32:52.013 --> 32:54.581
Yeah, I don't think
you should be alone.

32:54.624 --> 32:57.192
So, why don't we
go downstairs? Hmm?

32:57.236 --> 32:59.499
Where there's people and wine.

32:59.542 --> 33:02.197
I could use a drink.

33:06.897 --> 33:08.290
KIRBY:
Did you know

33:08.334 --> 33:09.726
Culhane was here?I did.

33:09.770 --> 33:12.207
The Atlantix were exploring
a partnership of sorts

33:12.251 --> 33:13.904
with the hotel after we open.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.994
Could be a very lucrative
arrangement for La Mirage.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.083
Oh. Of course.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.389
'Cause money is more important
than feelings,

33:20.433 --> 33:22.783
especially when
they're mine.

33:22.826 --> 33:24.524
I'm sorry your personal
partnership didn't work out.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.047
But I've known him
for years.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.528
Yeah. You've known me
for a few years, too, Dad.

33:28.571 --> 33:29.833
Doesn't seem to
mean much, though.

33:29.877 --> 33:33.141
You know, just once it'd
be nice if you chose me.

33:33.185 --> 33:35.926
This is not about you, Kirby.
It's not even about me.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.798
I have a responsibility
to Sam

33:37.841 --> 33:40.322
to look after the best interests
of this hotel.

33:40.366 --> 33:41.758
If you don't like the deal,

33:41.802 --> 33:43.673
perhaps you should
take it up with him.

33:43.717 --> 33:46.024
And I think
it's probably for the best

33:46.067 --> 33:47.547
that things didn't work out
with Michael.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.375
What do you mean?

33:49.418 --> 33:53.422
I mean that you and Michael
dated for all of five minutes.

33:53.466 --> 33:54.989
If this is how
you're reacting,

33:55.033 --> 33:56.817
then obviously you still have
a lot of growing up to do.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.736
Cab or pinot?

34:02.779 --> 34:04.912
Yes.

34:04.955 --> 34:07.001
Uh, maybe we should
pace ourselves?

34:07.045 --> 34:10.135
Why don't we take
a selfie? Mm?

34:10.178 --> 34:11.484
Here.

34:11.527 --> 34:13.355
Okay, ready?

34:16.315 --> 34:18.012
Oh. Adam.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.927
There you are.

34:19.970 --> 34:21.494
I think it all turned out
pretty well, don't you?

34:21.537 --> 34:23.322
Thanks for holding
down the fort

34:23.365 --> 34:25.411
while I finished up
those new labels.

34:25.454 --> 34:27.065
I think your dad
seemed to like them.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.631
Everyone loves things
when they're shiny and new.

34:28.675 --> 34:30.242
But you know
my father these days.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.766
He changes wives
like he changes companies.

34:32.809 --> 34:35.377
I haven't known him
that long actually,

34:35.421 --> 34:37.249
but, um, then again,
neither have you.

34:37.292 --> 34:38.772
I'm his flesh and blood.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.730
His one and only son, his heir.

34:40.774 --> 34:42.689
SAM:
You look like

34:42.732 --> 34:45.344
someone killed your dog in
every single one of these.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.694
Fallon, there must be something
that'll cheer you up.

34:47.737 --> 34:48.999
Come on.

34:49.043 --> 34:51.089
There might be
one little thing.

34:51.132 --> 34:54.179
I know you stole that invitation
and made those other labels.

34:54.222 --> 34:56.659
And I told Blake. So I wouldn't
get too cocky if I were you.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.139
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.749
And I'm guessing
you have no evidence

34:59.793 --> 35:01.969
for any of these
accusations.

35:02.012 --> 35:03.884
This time.

35:03.927 --> 35:06.278
But something tells me
it won't be the last.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.760
âª Ah, watch out

35:10.804 --> 35:13.502
âª You might get
what you're after âª

35:13.546 --> 35:15.635
âª Cool babies

35:15.678 --> 35:18.377
âª Strange but not a stranger

35:18.420 --> 35:22.555
âª I'm an ordinary gal

35:22.598 --> 35:24.165
âª Burning down the house

35:24.209 --> 35:25.993
Are you hearing this?

35:26.036 --> 35:27.168
I'm trying.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.170
âª Hold tight

35:29.214 --> 35:31.303
âª Wait till the party's over

35:31.346 --> 35:33.696
âª Hold tight

35:33.740 --> 35:36.656
âª We're in for nasty weather

35:36.699 --> 35:41.574
âª There has got to be a way

35:41.617 --> 35:43.141
âª Burning down the house

35:44.664 --> 35:46.796
âª Here's your ticket,
pack your bags âª

35:46.840 --> 35:49.408
âª Time for jumping overboard

35:49.451 --> 35:52.541
âª The transportation is here

35:54.021 --> 35:56.328
âª Close enough,
but not too far âª

35:56.371 --> 35:58.678
âª Maybe you know where you are

35:58.721 --> 36:01.507
âª Fighting fire with fire

36:03.291 --> 36:05.859
âª Mm, all wet

36:05.902 --> 36:08.078
âª Yeah, you might
need a raincoat âª

36:08.122 --> 36:10.168
âª Shakedown

36:10.211 --> 36:13.083
âª Dreams walking
in broad daylight âª

36:13.127 --> 36:14.781
âª Three hundred

36:14.824 --> 36:18.132
âª And sixty-five degrees

36:18.176 --> 36:19.525
âª Burning down the house

36:21.962 --> 36:24.225
âª My house

36:24.269 --> 36:26.967
âª Out of the ordinary

36:27.010 --> 36:28.708
âª That's right

36:28.751 --> 36:31.232
âª Don't want to
hurt nobody âª

36:31.276 --> 36:35.584
âª Some things sure can
sweep me off my feet âª

36:35.628 --> 36:37.499
âª Burning down the house

36:37.543 --> 36:39.588
What is he even talking about?

36:39.632 --> 36:41.895
âª No visible means of support

36:41.938 --> 36:45.638
âª And you have not seen
nothing yet âª

36:45.681 --> 36:46.987
âª Everything's stuck together

36:48.858 --> 36:51.165
âª And I don't know
what you expect âª

36:51.209 --> 36:54.037
âª Staring into the TV set

36:54.081 --> 36:56.518
âª Fighting fire with fire

37:00.957 --> 37:04.526
âª Burning down the house.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.703
ADAM: Bo. Bo,
where'd you get that?

37:10.445 --> 37:11.794
Huh?

37:15.102 --> 37:16.625
It's been a long time.Probably doesn't remember.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.171
Oh! I got it.

37:41.215 --> 37:42.695
I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

37:53.488 --> 37:55.708
Liam? Are you real?

37:59.233 --> 38:01.366
Oh, my God,
you arereal.

38:01.409 --> 38:02.584
And you're not
wearing a ring.

38:02.628 --> 38:05.283
Yeah. I didn't get married.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.610
Oh, my God.What the hell
happened in here?

38:28.654 --> 38:29.916
Why the hell are you in my room?

38:29.959 --> 38:31.700
Why does it smell
like melted cheese?

38:31.744 --> 38:33.311
Someone call 911!

38:38.968 --> 38:40.100
Hang in there, okay?I'm so sorry.

38:40.143 --> 38:42.624
You have nothing
to apologize for.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.887
You probably saved
all of our lives.

38:44.931 --> 38:46.280
If you hadn't caught
that gas leak when you did,

38:46.324 --> 38:47.847
who knows how much worse
it would have been.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.979
What if I can never see again?

38:50.023 --> 38:52.939
Let's just...
see what the doctor says.

38:52.982 --> 38:55.115
I'm a doctor; I've seen
injuries like this before.

38:55.158 --> 38:56.116
Some people...

38:56.159 --> 38:58.248
You are not "some people."

38:58.292 --> 38:59.641
You are my son.

38:59.685 --> 39:02.470
No matter what happens,
I'm gonna be here.

39:02.514 --> 39:05.125
I'm gonna take care of you.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.561
PARAMEDIC:
Time to go, Mr. Carrington.

39:12.959 --> 39:15.091
LIAM: Is he okay? FALLON: I'm sure he will be.

39:15.135 --> 39:16.789
I can't say the same
for my fireplace,

39:16.832 --> 39:20.270
and I basically spent the entire
day hallucinating from gas,

39:20.314 --> 39:22.838
but... none of that matters.

39:22.882 --> 39:25.406
Because you're here.

39:25.450 --> 39:26.494
Did you read the book?

39:26.538 --> 39:29.149
I read it.You did?

39:29.192 --> 39:31.369
That's great.
I knew that once you read it,

39:31.412 --> 39:32.892
you would remember
what we had.

39:32.935 --> 39:34.372
You know, you and me,
not Trashley...

39:34.415 --> 39:36.199
Fallon. You were right.

39:36.243 --> 39:38.637
I didn't marry Ashley
because of the book.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.204
Obviously, there's way more
to this than I can remember.

39:41.248 --> 39:42.641
Mm-hmm.And I...

39:42.684 --> 39:45.905
I shouldn't marry anyone
until I can fill in those holes.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.560
Or course.
We can take it slow.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.780
No. That's not what I mean.

39:51.824 --> 39:54.261
The book didn't
make me fall in love

39:54.304 --> 39:56.219
with you again.

39:56.263 --> 39:57.830
Or at all.

39:57.873 --> 39:59.745
What?

39:59.788 --> 40:03.052
Look, if I wrote that book, and
if that's how I feel about you--

40:03.096 --> 40:07.448
The girl in that book
is selfish, callous.

40:07.492 --> 40:08.536
I mean, she's definitely
a narcissist.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.364
Okay, okay, I get it.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.279
I'm sorry.

40:12.322 --> 40:14.890
I just... I think I need
to be on my own for a while.

40:16.762 --> 40:18.416
Okay.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.214
I saw you downstairs.

40:34.257 --> 40:35.520
Yeah, you did.

40:35.563 --> 40:36.782
I'm sorry we didn't get
a proper introduction.

40:36.825 --> 40:38.000
I'm Kirby.

40:38.044 --> 40:39.611
Victor.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.569
I'd shake your hand,
but...

40:41.613 --> 40:43.179
My dad runs the hotel,

40:43.223 --> 40:45.747
so I wanted to come and give you
a proper welcome.

40:45.791 --> 40:46.879
Would you like a drink?

40:50.883 --> 40:52.624
Hey, what if something
happened to her?

40:52.667 --> 40:53.799
Or she's gone.

40:55.235 --> 40:56.105
It wouldn't be the first time.

41:00.109 --> 41:02.198
I could use one of those.

41:02.242 --> 41:03.461
Where have you been?

41:03.504 --> 41:05.419
We heard something about
some sort of explosion

41:05.463 --> 41:07.247
at the Carrington Manor.MONICA:
Is everyone okay?

41:07.290 --> 41:08.901
I asked Fallon, but she
hasn't texted me back.

41:08.944 --> 41:10.555
It was a gas leak.
Fallon's fine.

41:10.598 --> 41:13.383
Adam Carrington got
the brunt of it.

41:13.427 --> 41:14.820
What happened?

41:14.863 --> 41:16.952
I was planning on
spoiling the wine,

41:16.996 --> 41:18.867
but let's just say
a better opportunity came along.

41:18.911 --> 41:20.695
Adam hurt you.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.784
He tried to do more than that.

41:24.438 --> 41:26.135
An eye for an eye, isn't it?

41:26.179 --> 41:28.007
I'm gonna go freshen up.

41:31.401 --> 41:33.186
You don't think... she...

41:33.229 --> 41:34.404
I think she did.

41:37.582 --> 41:38.583
VANESSA:
Hello?

41:38.626 --> 41:40.454
Vanessa? Hi, sweetheart.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.065
Sorry to call you so late,
but I know you've been worried.

41:43.109 --> 41:44.980
Things have been
a little delicate here,

41:45.024 --> 41:46.852
but I'm getting it all
back on track.

41:46.895 --> 41:50.595
We are going to get everything
we've always talked about.

41:50.638 --> 41:52.248
When?

41:52.292 --> 41:55.600
Soon. I just need you to
sit tight a little while longer.

41:55.643 --> 41:57.253
Okay?

41:57.297 --> 41:59.908
