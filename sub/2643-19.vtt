WEBVTT

00:02.192 --> 00:06.512
Why hast thou forsaken me,
O deity whose existence I doubt?

00:07.846 --> 00:10.849
Here. Breathe
into this bag.

00:12.135 --> 00:13.335
What's going on?

00:13.336 --> 00:16.004
They stole everything, Leonard!

00:16.006 --> 00:17.439
Everything.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.191
Are you the roommate?

00:19.192 --> 00:21.276
Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter.
What happened?

00:21.277 --> 00:23.512
Your friend here called 911
to report a robbery.

00:23.513 --> 00:25.447
Oh, my God, what did they get?

00:25.448 --> 00:26.732
What didn't they get?

00:26.733 --> 00:28.684
They got my enchanted weapons,

00:28.685 --> 00:30.653
my vicious gladiator armor,

00:30.654 --> 00:32.988
my wand of untainted power,

00:32.989 --> 00:35.958
and all my gold!

00:35.959 --> 00:37.760
You called the police

00:37.761 --> 00:40.529
because someone hacked your
World of Warcraft account?

00:40.530 --> 00:42.965
What choice did I have?

00:42.966 --> 00:46.168
The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf,

00:46.169 --> 00:47.970
hero of the Eastern kingdoms,

00:47.971 --> 00:52.174
has been picked clean, like
a carcass in the desert sun.

00:53.443 --> 00:55.044
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

00:56.780 --> 00:58.981
Into the bag.

00:59.649 --> 01:02.985
They took my battle ostrich!

01:02.986 --> 01:05.319
Oh, no, not Glenn!
Yes!

01:05.321 --> 01:06.655
Glenn!

01:06.656 --> 01:08.857
The only bird I ever loved.

01:10.360 --> 01:12.161
Good luck, fellas.

01:12.162 --> 01:13.862
Oh. Well, thank you, officer.

01:13.863 --> 01:15.130
Wait a minute!

01:15.131 --> 01:16.632
You're not going to do anything?

01:16.633 --> 01:17.800
Mr. Cooper,
there's nothing...

01:17.801 --> 01:19.301
Dr. Cooper.

01:20.170 --> 01:21.870
Seriously?

01:22.972 --> 01:25.741
Not the kind with
access to drugs.

01:26.676 --> 01:28.711
Fine. Dr. Cooper.

01:28.712 --> 01:30.145
I'm sorry for your loss,

01:30.146 --> 01:31.680
but the Pasadena
Police Department

01:31.681 --> 01:33.916
doesn't have jurisdiction in...

01:33.917 --> 01:35.818
Pandora.

01:35.819 --> 01:38.487
<i>That's from Avatar!</i>

01:39.789 --> 01:41.824
World of Warcraft
takes place in Azeroth.

01:41.825 --> 01:44.693
Goodness gracious, how are you
allowed to carry a gun?

01:45.795 --> 01:49.832
Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

01:49.833 --> 01:51.166
What?

01:51.167 --> 01:53.969
Wh... you know, one who was
drummed off the force

01:53.970 --> 01:55.804
because he refused
to play by the rules,

01:55.805 --> 01:57.506
and now he hires himself out

01:57.507 --> 02:00.709
to impose his own brand
of rough justice?

02:01.578 --> 02:03.445
No.

02:04.831 --> 02:06.498
Thank you, officer.

02:07.383 --> 02:10.018
<i>It's all gone. All gone.</i>

02:10.019 --> 02:11.887
I'm really sorry, Sheldon.

02:11.888 --> 02:13.555
What kind of world
do we live in,

02:13.556 --> 02:17.493
where a man would take
another man's battle ostrich?

02:17.494 --> 02:19.394
I don't know.

02:20.196 --> 02:21.764
This act of aggression
must be met

02:21.765 --> 02:24.133
with swift and cruel ferocity.

02:24.134 --> 02:28.771
It is time to cry havoc,
and let slip the dogs of war.

02:28.772 --> 02:30.939
I'm on it.

02:34.177 --> 02:37.045
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz.
Is, is Howard there?

02:38.348 --> 02:40.215
Okay, thanks.

02:40.216 --> 02:41.717
That particular dog of war

02:41.718 --> 02:43.819
will have to call you back
after his bath.

02:47.257 --> 02:49.558
See if Raj is done with Pilates.

Three thousand hours
clicking on that mouse,

03:20.370 --> 03:22.338
collecting weapons and gold.

03:22.339 --> 03:27.210
It's almost as if it was
a huge waste of time.

03:27.211 --> 03:28.845
Whoever did this
knew what they were doing.

03:28.846 --> 03:30.880
He got in and out
of your account in under

03:30.881 --> 03:33.382
15 minutes, transferred
all your stuff,

03:33.383 --> 03:34.617
and didn't leave
a digital fingerprint.

03:35.853 --> 03:38.421
There isn't enough
chamomile tea in the world

03:38.422 --> 03:41.324
to quell the rage in my heart.

03:42.459 --> 03:44.026
Hold on. I'm talking to an orc

03:44.027 --> 03:45.595
under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff

03:45.596 --> 03:48.431
who says if we pay him, he'll
help us track down your things.

03:48.432 --> 03:49.932
Can we trust him?

03:49.933 --> 03:52.235
I should say so;
He appears to be a member

03:52.236 --> 03:54.771
of the Nigerian royal family.

03:56.573 --> 03:59.642
Whoa! Somebody's auctioning off
a jeweled ostrich bridle!

03:59.643 --> 04:01.277
No. Glenn's was leather.

04:02.146 --> 04:04.313
He was a simple ostrich.

04:04.314 --> 04:07.316
Is! Is, I haven't given up hope.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.086
Hey.

04:10.087 --> 04:12.321
Hey, Penny. We're kind of in
the middle of a crisis, here.

04:12.322 --> 04:14.690
Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

04:14.691 --> 04:18.027
Sorry, Sheldon. I know
that game meant a lot to you.

04:18.028 --> 04:20.096
What... "that game"?

04:21.197 --> 04:25.034
Excuse me, Penny, but
Doodle Jump is a game.

04:25.035 --> 04:27.703
Angry Birds is a game.

04:27.704 --> 04:29.172
World of Warcraft is a

04:29.173 --> 04:33.342
massively multi-player
online role-playing...

04:33.343 --> 04:35.278
all right,
technically it's a game.

04:36.613 --> 04:40.316
Bad news, the Nigerian prince
may be a fraud.

04:40.317 --> 04:42.551
Okay, well, anyways,
I brought you

04:42.552 --> 04:44.103
a day-old cheesecake
to cheer you up!

04:44.104 --> 04:46.689
Stale pastry is hollow succor

04:46.690 --> 04:49.158
to a man who is
bereft of ostrich.

04:50.027 --> 04:51.460
Just say "thank you."

04:51.461 --> 04:54.030
I thought I just did.

04:54.031 --> 04:57.867
All right. See you later.

04:57.868 --> 04:58.968
Oh! Hello.

04:58.969 --> 05:01.204
Oh, hi! I was just
dropping off a cheesecake

05:01.205 --> 05:04.373
to Sheldon. He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap

05:04.374 --> 05:06.976
that's useful in
a make-believe place.

05:07.845 --> 05:09.312
I don't know what that means.

05:09.313 --> 05:12.148
Yeah, well, sadly, I do.

05:14.384 --> 05:16.352
Did you know last weekend
Priya took Leonard

05:16.353 --> 05:17.753
rollerblading at the beach?

05:17.754 --> 05:19.522
Can you believe that?

05:19.523 --> 05:22.475
I feel like I'm supposed
to say "that bitch,"

05:22.476 --> 05:25.027
but I don't have
enough information.

05:25.028 --> 05:27.396
I am the one who
spent two years

05:27.397 --> 05:28.598
trying to get him to even

05:28.599 --> 05:30.233
go to the beach
in the first place.

05:30.234 --> 05:32.285
And he was so phobic about
stepping on medical waste,

05:32.286 --> 05:34.203
I had to carry him
to the water.

05:34.204 --> 05:36.906
I took Howard to the beach once.

05:36.907 --> 05:39.976
He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

05:41.044 --> 05:44.130
So what's the thanks
I get for turning Leonard

05:44.131 --> 05:45.831
into quality boyfriend material?

05:45.832 --> 05:48.017
I have to tiptoe around
his new girlfriend.

05:48.018 --> 05:50.670
I think you're on.
Oh.

05:50.671 --> 05:53.923
That bitch!

05:53.924 --> 05:56.692
Want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

05:56.693 --> 05:59.595
Ah, here's the alcohol
and drug peer pressure

05:59.596 --> 06:01.097
Mother warned me about.

06:02.199 --> 06:04.934
I was starting to think
it was never going to happen.

06:04.935 --> 06:07.670
Yes, please.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.372
You guys should've seen Leonard
when I first met him.

06:09.373 --> 06:10.373
There was no eye contact.

06:10.374 --> 06:11.774
He was either looking
up at the ceiling,

06:11.775 --> 06:13.442
or down at his shoes.

06:13.443 --> 06:15.378
I'm drunk.

06:17.147 --> 06:19.165
You know, for the
first couple of months,

06:19.166 --> 06:20.983
whenever I would
take off my bra,

06:20.984 --> 06:25.821
he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends!"

06:25.822 --> 06:28.057
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

06:28.058 --> 06:30.026
I'm never speaking
to Priya again.

06:30.027 --> 06:31.093
No, don't do that.

06:31.094 --> 06:32.645
No reason to be mean to her.

06:32.646 --> 06:36.065
This may be the
alcohol talking...

06:36.066 --> 06:37.300
but I believe there is.

06:37.301 --> 06:39.468
Are you familiar
with the recent study

06:39.469 --> 06:41.904
of Tanzanian chimpanzees
by Nishida and Hosaka

06:41.905 --> 06:44.140
out of Kyoto University?

06:44.141 --> 06:47.376
No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

06:47.377 --> 06:50.279
Primates, such as ourselves,
have a natural instinct

06:50.280 --> 06:52.882
to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

06:52.883 --> 06:54.216
Bernadette's urge to

06:54.217 --> 06:57.053
shun, scowl or
fling her waste at Priya

06:57.054 --> 06:59.288
is hard-wired into her DNA.

06:59.289 --> 07:03.192
I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

07:03.193 --> 07:05.528
Believe me, it's there,
we all have it.

07:05.529 --> 07:08.698
Hit me with some more booze,
and I'll show you.

07:10.884 --> 07:13.135
All right, here we are...
this is the tavern

07:13.136 --> 07:16.806
where all the black-market
weapon trades go down.

07:16.807 --> 07:19.608
I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

07:19.609 --> 07:21.811
Everyone's undressing
her with their eyes.

07:21.812 --> 07:23.980
Maybe if you stop
dropping your sword

07:23.981 --> 07:26.215
and bending over to pick it up.

07:27.634 --> 07:29.268
Okay, what exactly
are we looking for?

07:29.269 --> 07:31.354
Redheaded troll,
goes by the name of Glumly.

07:31.355 --> 07:32.388
According to the
message boards,

07:32.389 --> 07:33.923
if you want to
move stolen goods

07:33.924 --> 07:36.058
and it's after school
hours, he's your guy.

07:36.059 --> 07:37.326
Leonard, is this going

07:37.327 --> 07:39.128
to take much longer?
I thought we were

07:39.129 --> 07:40.529
going to spend
some time together.

07:40.530 --> 07:41.964
Uh, we are.
In the meantime,

07:41.965 --> 07:44.767
you're welcome to whip up
a quick character and join us.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.335
Seriously?

07:46.336 --> 07:48.938
Well, you have to put
in a credit card number,

07:48.939 --> 07:50.906
but it's fun.

07:50.907 --> 07:52.675
Maybe I should just go home.

07:52.676 --> 07:54.176
Our troll just walked
in! I got him!

07:54.177 --> 07:56.012
We got him.
We're almost done.

07:56.013 --> 07:57.013
So, how do

07:57.014 --> 07:58.297
you guys want to play this?

07:58.298 --> 07:59.849
Be ruthless.
You tell him

07:59.850 --> 08:02.151
if he doesn't start talking,
we'll register a complaint

08:02.152 --> 08:05.054
with his Internet
service provider.

08:05.055 --> 08:08.524
<i>Sheldon, what if he gets his
Internet from his cable company?</i>

08:08.525 --> 08:13.462
He could lose his HBO and all their
delightful original programming.

08:13.463 --> 08:16.799
I don't care!
I'm losin' it, man!

08:16.800 --> 08:18.267
Why don't we play this smart?

08:18.268 --> 08:20.569
Try a little
"good goblin, bad goblin."

08:20.570 --> 08:22.638
Oh, dear Lord.

08:22.639 --> 08:24.907
Nah, I think we have
to be more subtle.

08:24.908 --> 08:27.877
Okay, I see where
this is going.

08:27.878 --> 08:30.446
Fine, I'll have sex with him.

08:32.349 --> 08:35.551
That's not where it was going.

08:35.552 --> 08:38.788
Good, because
I would hate that.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.759
Leonard, you're busy... let's
talk tomorrow. Oh, wait.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.345
Hang on. Are you upset?
No, no, I think

08:46.346 --> 08:48.864
it's sexy to date a boy
trapped in a man's body.

08:49.866 --> 08:50.866
Good, good.

08:50.867 --> 08:53.569
I'll tell you what happens.

08:54.738 --> 08:57.473
<i>And people think I
don't get sarcasm.</i>

09:00.610 --> 09:03.612
Well, well, well.

09:04.915 --> 09:06.165
Look who it is.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.249
Okay, be nice.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.451
Hello.

09:08.452 --> 09:10.369
Hi. We're just
heading out for a drink.

09:10.370 --> 09:13.389
Because I do that now.

09:14.324 --> 09:15.424
Count your blessings

09:15.425 --> 09:17.593
you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

09:18.728 --> 09:19.762
What?

09:19.763 --> 09:20.713
Don't listen to her...

09:20.714 --> 09:22.631
she's had a lot of ice cream.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.567
Do you want to join us?

09:24.568 --> 09:27.236
Oh, thank you,
but I have work to do.

09:29.339 --> 09:31.807
Four women walk
down the stairs...

09:31.808 --> 09:34.393
how many reach the lobby?

09:39.679 --> 09:42.314
Did your sister say anything
when you got home last night?

09:42.315 --> 09:44.666
Oh, no, don't put me
in the middle of this.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.334
I'm not going to
be your go-between.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.502
Come on, help me out.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.903
Am I in trouble?

09:48.904 --> 09:50.855
There's no reason to worry.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.007
That's a relief.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.208
I'm sure many women

09:53.209 --> 09:55.143
in happy relationships
spend their nights

09:55.144 --> 09:57.545
Skyping with their
ex-boyfriend Sanjay.

10:00.916 --> 10:03.118
Good news, gentlemen...
I found our hacker.

10:03.119 --> 10:04.452
What?
Really?

10:04.453 --> 10:06.320
Yeah. No one can hide from me,

10:06.321 --> 10:08.006
not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego,

10:08.007 --> 10:10.225
not even topless
Natalie Portman.

10:11.260 --> 10:13.061
I've never said
these words before,

10:13.062 --> 10:15.463
but good job, Howard!

10:16.532 --> 10:20.969
Thanks. Our culprit
is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711

10:20.970 --> 10:22.170
Ocean View Road,

10:22.171 --> 10:23.738
Carlsbad, California.

10:23.739 --> 10:26.741
The name and the address
drip with evil.

10:26.742 --> 10:28.076
What else do we know about him?

10:28.077 --> 10:29.894
Why, quite a bit, actually.

10:29.895 --> 10:33.114
I'll bet he's some loser
who lives with his parents.

10:37.620 --> 10:40.288
Yes, he does live
with his parents.

10:40.289 --> 10:44.592
Here's a Google Earth
shot of their house.

10:44.593 --> 10:46.561
Excellent!
It's in a cul-de-sac.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.729
We can box him in.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.632
Hold on, you're thinking
of going there?

10:50.633 --> 10:52.967
Carlsbad is only
a couple of hours away.

10:52.968 --> 10:54.085
Fine.

10:54.086 --> 10:56.037
You walk up to the house,
knock on the door

10:56.038 --> 10:58.039
and demand your stuff back.
What if he says no?

10:58.040 --> 11:00.275
I don't know if you've been
following the news, Leonard,

11:00.276 --> 11:02.077
but there have been
some terrific advancements

11:02.078 --> 11:03.678
in the field of torture.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.148
No one's getting tortured.

11:07.149 --> 11:09.384
Fine, we'll abide by
the Geneva Convention.

11:09.385 --> 11:10.819
But ask yourself this,

11:10.820 --> 11:12.854
in the course of our lives,

11:12.855 --> 11:15.190
how much lunch money
has been taken from us?

11:15.191 --> 11:16.941
How many kites?

11:16.942 --> 11:19.694
How many Scooby-Doo
Trapper Keepers?

11:20.362 --> 11:21.830
I totally had one of those.

11:21.831 --> 11:23.231
Of course you did.

11:23.232 --> 11:25.767
It was a fun and practical way
of organizing your school work.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.119
But the bullies
took it from us.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.104
Well, no more.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.272
Tonight, we take back
our dignity,

11:31.273 --> 11:33.374
our birthright and our pride.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.542
What do you say?

11:34.543 --> 11:36.044
Who's with me?

11:40.149 --> 11:43.918
I have a hip-hop aerobics class
at 5:00; could we go after?

11:43.919 --> 11:45.887
Sure.

11:46.722 --> 11:47.755
Also, tonight's the Sabbath

11:47.756 --> 11:49.324
and my mother and I
have a tradition of

11:49.325 --> 11:51.526
<i>lighting the candles and
watching Wheel of Fortune, so...</i>

11:51.527 --> 11:52.560
If we could leave

11:52.561 --> 11:53.862
at 8:00, we'd still be able to

11:53.863 --> 11:55.463
regain our birthright
at 10:00, 10:30 latest.

11:55.464 --> 11:57.565
Fine.

11:57.566 --> 11:59.868
Leonard?

11:59.869 --> 12:02.537
Oh, geez, I-I don't know
if I can ditch Priya

12:02.538 --> 12:03.872
two nights in a row.

12:03.873 --> 12:05.039
Oh, come on, man.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.709
Bros before...

12:11.046 --> 12:12.313
my sister.

12:13.282 --> 12:14.816
Aw, screw it.

12:14.817 --> 12:15.950
I'm in.
Me, too.

12:15.951 --> 12:17.819
And me.

12:18.637 --> 12:20.839
One moment.

12:24.293 --> 12:26.561
I'm hell-bent on catching
a cyber criminal,

12:26.562 --> 12:28.813
not the common cold.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.802
I'm sorry, I thought
this delay was

12:34.803 --> 12:37.405
<i>so you could watch Wheel of
Fortune with your mother.</i>

12:37.406 --> 12:38.640
I am.

12:38.641 --> 12:40.275
She's just bleaching
her mustache.

12:41.143 --> 12:42.477
Check it out.

12:42.478 --> 12:44.646
Hey, Ma!
"Before and After!"

12:44.647 --> 12:48.082
Four words, 17 letters,
two N's, one V!

12:48.083 --> 12:50.518
"Fanny pack of wolves!"

12:52.922 --> 12:53.988
That's incredible.

12:53.989 --> 12:55.657
<i>Yeah, she's kind of
a Wheel savant.</i>

12:56.992 --> 12:59.594
Uh-oh, that's Priya.

13:00.729 --> 13:04.265
Sitar music for her ringtone
is not cool, dude.

13:04.266 --> 13:05.934
Hit the...

13:06.936 --> 13:09.804
Hey, sweetie.

13:09.805 --> 13:11.072
Yeah, I'm sorry.

13:11.073 --> 13:12.974
I'm gonna be working late.

13:14.243 --> 13:16.277
Yeah, I-I miss you, too.

13:17.279 --> 13:19.280
Okay, sure, I'll call you
when I get home.

13:19.281 --> 13:20.782
Okay, bye-bye.

13:20.783 --> 13:22.050
Very nice.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.851
You lie to my sister.

13:25.187 --> 13:27.455
That's the nicest thing
he does to your sister.

13:34.797 --> 13:36.297
Oh, guess who.

13:36.298 --> 13:37.832
Cover for me.

13:39.768 --> 13:41.169
Hello, Priya. What's up?

13:41.170 --> 13:43.538
How would I know
if Leonard's at work or not?

13:43.539 --> 13:46.074
Don't be suspicious.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.842
Look, if you want your
relationship with Leonard

13:47.843 --> 13:49.510
to continue,
you're going to have to believe

13:49.511 --> 13:51.279
whatever wild-eyed,
cockamamie excuse

13:51.280 --> 13:53.514
the white devil
has the nerve to offer you.

13:55.317 --> 13:58.253
Okay? Yeah, bye-bye.

13:59.221 --> 14:01.089
You owe me.

14:01.890 --> 14:03.825
New puzzle, Ma!

14:03.826 --> 14:05.126
"Same name"!

14:05.127 --> 14:06.828
One N, two D's, three O's!

14:06.829 --> 14:09.530
Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!

14:09.531 --> 14:10.865
That's uncanny.

14:10.866 --> 14:12.700
I know.
It's her superpower.

14:12.701 --> 14:14.769
Well, that and jiggling
her arm fat.

14:17.539 --> 14:20.174
I can't believe we're going
all the way to San Diego

14:20.175 --> 14:21.943
to confront this guy.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.579
Yeah, we're kind of
bad-asses, aren't we?

14:24.580 --> 14:25.947
Totally.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.815
Hey, how about
we stay the night

14:27.816 --> 14:30.285
and hit Legoland
in the morning?

14:30.286 --> 14:31.886
Sea World is better.

14:31.887 --> 14:35.923
It has Shamu, who is
literally tons of fun.

14:35.924 --> 14:39.193
But for the moment, let's stay
focused on Todd Zarnecki.

14:39.194 --> 14:41.863
Yeah, we're coming for you,
Todd Zarnecki.

14:41.864 --> 14:45.366
And for the record, Legoland
is more interactive.

14:46.035 --> 14:47.435
I almost feel sorry

14:47.436 --> 14:51.039
for the poor fool, sitting in
his split-level suburban ranch,

14:51.040 --> 14:52.373
unaware that

14:52.374 --> 14:56.077
a vengeful horde is barreling
down the San Diego Freeway

14:56.078 --> 14:58.313
at 71 miles an hour.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.780
Ease up there, lead foot.

14:59.781 --> 15:01.249
You trying to get us killed?

15:02.885 --> 15:05.486
I took the liberty
of burning us

15:05.487 --> 15:07.588
a mix of heroic questing music.

15:09.091 --> 15:12.860
This says "Beyonce
Bootylicious Dance Mix."

15:12.861 --> 15:14.529
It's a
re-writable CD.

15:14.530 --> 15:16.464
Just put it in.

15:16.465 --> 15:18.182
Beyonce? Really?

15:18.183 --> 15:20.034
She's curvy and she owns it.

15:20.035 --> 15:21.569
I like that.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.979
Oh, yeah, I'm feeling it.

15:31.980 --> 15:34.815
We are winged fury!

15:34.816 --> 15:36.217
Which is still no excuse

15:36.218 --> 15:38.119
for going over
the posted speed limit.

15:43.392 --> 15:45.927
Next time we go to
kick someone's ass,

15:45.928 --> 15:47.528
we take the train.

15:47.529 --> 15:50.965
I always prefer the train.

15:52.184 --> 15:54.185
Sheldon, let's go.

15:55.170 --> 15:56.771
Coming.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.709
Why did you bring that?

16:01.710 --> 16:04.729
No weapon strikes more fear
into a man's heart

16:04.730 --> 16:06.748
than a Klingon bat'leth.

16:06.749 --> 16:09.901
Okay, let's get
clear on something.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.986
We're just going to tell
this guy to transfer all of

16:11.987 --> 16:14.789
your stuff back into your
account and then be on our way.

16:14.790 --> 16:17.325
No one's bat'lething anybody.

16:18.260 --> 16:21.195
So my blade shall not
taste blood tonight?

16:21.196 --> 16:23.731
No.

16:23.732 --> 16:27.335
Well, now I just feel silly
holding it.

16:27.336 --> 16:29.003
Come on.

16:29.004 --> 16:31.839
Can I at least
kick down the door?

16:31.840 --> 16:34.308
You're welcome to try, but
the other day, it took you

16:34.309 --> 16:37.245
15 minutes to get
into a FedEx box.

16:40.616 --> 16:41.783
Who is it?

16:41.784 --> 16:43.584
Your doom!

16:43.585 --> 16:44.886
Don't say "your doom."

16:44.887 --> 16:47.288
Who opens the door
for their doom?

16:47.289 --> 16:48.656
Good point.

16:48.657 --> 16:50.658
Basket of puppies.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.395
What?

16:56.999 --> 16:58.933
Sheldon?

17:00.736 --> 17:03.104
Are you Todd Zarnecki?

17:03.105 --> 17:04.739
Yeah. Who are you?

17:04.740 --> 17:06.941
I am Sheldor of Azeroth.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.576
I want my things back.

17:08.577 --> 17:09.710
I don't think so.

17:09.711 --> 17:10.912
Let me see that.

17:10.913 --> 17:12.213
Careful.
That's a collectible.

17:12.214 --> 17:13.297
I know.

17:13.298 --> 17:16.884
I've always wanted one.

17:23.976 --> 17:27.094
Well, he's even more cunning
than we thought.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.367
You know, the joke's on him.

17:33.368 --> 17:35.703
Without the certificate of
authenticity,

17:35.704 --> 17:38.339
that bat'leth is worthless.

17:38.340 --> 17:41.609
Yeah, he walked
right into our trap.

17:42.878 --> 17:46.581
Legoland seems like
a hollow dream now.

17:50.135 --> 17:51.836
What's the matter?
Something's wrong.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.488
I'm not getting any gas.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.964
Anybody know anything about
internal combustion engines?

18:02.965 --> 18:03.931
Of course.

18:03.932 --> 18:05.433
19th-century technology.
Very basic.

18:05.434 --> 18:07.802
Does anybody know how to fix
an internal combustion engine?

18:07.803 --> 18:10.238
No. No.
Not a clue.

18:10.239 --> 18:13.374
Well, we'd better call somebody
to come pick us up.

18:13.375 --> 18:16.244
It'd be swell
if they had a train.

18:21.650 --> 18:23.451
Thank you, Penny.

18:23.452 --> 18:25.820
No problem.

18:25.821 --> 18:27.355
So, Leonard,

18:27.356 --> 18:29.423
I think it's interesting
you didn't call your girlfriend

18:29.424 --> 18:30.625
to come get you.

18:30.626 --> 18:33.094
Uh, I kind of
told her I was working.

18:33.095 --> 18:34.929
So you lied to her.

18:34.930 --> 18:36.797
Also interesting.

18:36.798 --> 18:38.549
Yeah, she doesn't really
understand

18:38.550 --> 18:41.502
the whole Warcraft
adventure-role-playing thing.

18:41.503 --> 18:45.172
Well, doesn't matter if she gets
it, as long as she's pretty.

18:46.341 --> 18:48.843
This one's funny, Leonard.

18:48.844 --> 18:51.279
How come you couldn't
make it work with her?

18:52.447 --> 18:55.049
So did you at least get
Sheldon's fake stuff back?

18:55.050 --> 18:58.352
No. We failed
in our noble quest.

18:58.353 --> 18:59.403
How come?

18:59.404 --> 19:02.957
Todd Zarnecki was mean.

19:02.958 --> 19:04.492
All right. Hang on.

19:04.493 --> 19:05.927
What are you doing?

19:05.928 --> 19:08.963
I'm gonna show you how we
finish a quest in Nebraska.

19:10.699 --> 19:13.668
Oh. Beyonce.

19:20.676 --> 19:22.476
This ain't no Beyonce.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.482
Now what?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.285
Give my friend his stuff back.

19:31.286 --> 19:33.154
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:33.155 --> 19:34.622
Well, then, good news.

19:34.623 --> 19:36.657
Today's the day a girl's
finally going to touch you

19:36.658 --> 19:38.058
in your little special place.

19:41.330 --> 19:43.831
Now give him his stuff back.

19:43.832 --> 19:45.366
Okay.

19:45.367 --> 19:46.834
We did it!

19:48.570 --> 19:51.255
I said, "we."

19:57.481 --> 19:59.649
Oh, hold the door.

19:59.650 --> 20:01.317
Oh, hi.
Hi.

20:02.486 --> 20:03.719
Going to see Leonard?

20:03.720 --> 20:05.688
Yes.

20:05.689 --> 20:07.039
How have you been?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.424
Fine. You?

20:08.425 --> 20:10.626
Very well, thank you.
