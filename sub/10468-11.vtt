09:49.371 --> 09:51.547
I MUST SAY, I THINK
IT'S AMAZING THAT YOU
WROTE THAT BOOK

09:51.547 --> 09:53.636
ABOUT THAT HORRIBLE
RELATIONSHIP YOU HAD.
WHEN'S IT BEING PUBLISHED?

09:53.636 --> 09:55.507
OH, ACTUALLY,
IT'S KIND OF NOT.

09:55.507 --> 09:58.293
OH. WELL, I GUESS
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IS YOU WROTE IT, RIGHT?

09:58.293 --> 10:01.296

10:11.349 --> 10:13.264
HOW CAN YOU TELL?
I'M NOT EVEN
CONSCIOUS YET.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.179
OH, HEY, WHILE YOU'RE UP,
WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH US?

10:15.179 --> 10:17.878
WE'RE GONNA DO A QUICK
8 MILES, THEN GRAB

8 MILES?

10:19.836 --> 10:21.969
YEAH! LAURA'S GOT ME
HOOKED ON THIS.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.101

10:33.981 --> 10:35.199
OK. BYE-BYE.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.027
OK, LISTEN.
I MADE RESERVATIONS

10:37.027 --> 10:38.681
AT THIS AMAZING
MANDARIN PLACE.

10:38.681 --> 10:39.900
YOU AND I HAVE SO MUCH
TO TALK ABOUT.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.293

TOTALLY--

10:51.389 --> 10:53.740
WELL, DO THE BEST YOU CAN

HOW'S IT GOING?

10:58.570 --> 11:01.356
WELL, 3 GUYS
ON THE EARLY SHIFT

11:01.356 --> 11:03.227
JUST CALLED IN
WITH THE FLU,

11:03.227 --> 11:05.273
SO I GOT TO FIND
REPLACEMENTS.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.144
I MEAN THE DESIGNS.
ANY PROGRESS?

11:07.144 --> 11:10.582
WELL, I FOUND OUT
A FEW WAYS TO SAVE
SOME MONEY,

11:10.582 --> 11:14.108
BUT I'M NOWHERE NEAR
FIGURING OUT HOW
TO PRODUCE THIS STUFF

11:14.108 --> 11:15.849
ON THE MONEY
WE HAVE TO SPEND.

11:15.849 --> 11:17.285
YOU'LL MAKE IT WORK,
CHARLIE.

11:17.285 --> 11:19.069
I GUESS.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.985
SURE DOESN'T HELP
I WAS UP HALF
THE NIGHT

11:21.985 --> 11:24.205
STRESSING ABOUT
THIS DAPHNE THING.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.381
LOOK, DAPHNE'S A BIG GIRL.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.470
IF SHE WANTS
TO MOVE IN WITH LUKE--

11:28.470 --> 11:30.733
WHAT ABOUT DIANA?

11:30.733 --> 11:32.692
DAPHNE JUST MET
THIS GUY.

11:32.692 --> 11:37.348
HE SEEMS GREAT,
BUT WHAT'S IT BEEN,
A FEW WEEKS?

11:37.348 --> 11:38.654
CHARLIE--

11:38.654 --> 11:40.134
THEN I STARTED
READING THESE.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.831
THOSE RISK DISCLOSURE
THINGS?

11:41.831 --> 11:43.703
THOSE ARE ALL
WORST CASE SCENARIOS.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.357
IT SAYS IN HERE THAT
THE SURGERY CAN DAMAGE
YOUR BOWEL,

11:46.357 --> 11:48.055
YOUR BLADDER.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.883
YEAH, WELL, BUT THAT'S
INCREDIBLY RARE.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.972
THERE'S ALSO
A BIGGER CHANCE
OF ECTOPIC PREGNANCY.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.714
CHARLIE, WE KNEW THAT.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.455
THAT'S PART OF WHY WE WENT
FOR THE IVF.

11:57.455 --> 12:00.807
BUT THEN, AFTER THE OPERATION,
FOR AS LONG AS WE'RE TRYING,

12:00.807 --> 12:03.244
THEY'RE GOING TO CHECK UP
ON ME EVERY MONTH,

12:03.244 --> 12:04.898
SO PLEASE STOP WORRYING.

12:04.898 --> 12:09.293
YOU CAN'T STOP SOMEONE
FROM WORRYING, KIRSTEN.

12:09.293 --> 12:12.166
WELL, TRY. OK?

12:12.166 --> 12:14.342
YOU'VE GOT TO FOCUS.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.866
THIS PROJECT
COULD LAUNCH YOU, CHARLIE,

12:16.866 --> 12:18.389

[TELEPHONE RINGS]

12:19.608 --> 12:22.219

FOR CALLING BACK.

12:24.134 --> 12:28.748

WITH MORGAN TWOMBLEY?

12:34.405 --> 12:37.278
GOT MY SHOES BACK.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.280

DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

12:39.280 --> 12:42.544

IS STAND UP FOR Y--

ABOUT THE FLOOD BEING OVER.

THE VICTOR KRISPIES
AS A PEACE OFFERING?

CAME WITH ME,

BUT SHE'S HANGING OUT
WITH HER EX-BOYFRIEND.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.362
YOU'RE LUCKY.
MY DAD'S AN ALUM, RIGHT,

13:18.362 --> 13:20.277
SO HE JUST HAD TO COME ALONG
WHEN I VISITED.

13:20.277 --> 13:23.715
I GOT TO HEAR ABOUT
EVERY LAMPPOST HE KISSED
SOME DEBUTANTE UNDER.

13:23.715 --> 13:27.110
ANYWAY, THESE ARE
THE PLACES THAT I
REALLY WANTED TO VISIT.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.720
I MARKED THEM ON THE MAP.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.592

LINSLEY-CHIT.

IF THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANT TO SEE.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.556
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THOSE ARE
THE RECOMMENDED PLACES.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.732
YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S THE STANDARD

13:44.519 --> 13:45.955
IT'S JUST IT REALLY
WON'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.435
IT WON'T?

13:47.435 --> 13:50.133
WHY DON'T I GIVE YOU
THE INSIDER'S TOUR?

13:50.133 --> 13:52.396
YOU KNOW, ALL THE STUFF
THEY DON'T PUT
IN THE BROCHURES.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.922
AT LEAST THAT WAY,
YOU'LL KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELF INTO.

WITH YOUR BANANA SPLIT?

14:08.543 --> 14:10.153

14:10.153 --> 14:11.763
I WANT BANANA SOUP.

14:14.592 --> 14:18.379
YOU KNOW, YOU SPENT
THE WHOLE AFTERNOON
WITH OWEN.

14:18.379 --> 14:21.338
IF YOU WANT TO GO SEE HER,
I CAN TAKE HIM BOWLING.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.558
GO SEE WHO?

14:24.820 --> 14:26.300
HOLLY?

14:26.300 --> 14:28.084
WHY?
WHY WOULD YOU ASSUME--

14:28.084 --> 14:30.913
OH, MAYBE BECAUSE
EVERY OTHER WORD YOU SAY
THESE DAYS

14:30.913 --> 14:32.436
STARTS WITH "H"
AND ENDS WITH OLLY.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.612

JUST GO SEE HER?

14:34.612 --> 14:36.788

OUR NIGHT OFF.

14:36.788 --> 14:37.964
SO MAKE FRIDAY
YOUR NIGHT OFF.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.357
CAN'T DO THAT.
WHY NOT?

14:40.357 --> 14:43.143
BECAUSE--BECAUSE I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

14:43.143 --> 14:44.884
WE'D JUST TURN FRIDAY
INTO SATURDAY,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.798
THEN SUNDAY WE'D COME UP
WITH SOME OTHER EXCUSE,

14:46.798 --> 14:48.539
AND PRETTY SOON,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE
A NIGHT OFF AT ALL.

14:48.539 --> 14:51.107
AND THIS WOULD BE BAD
BECAUSE...

14:51.107 --> 14:52.326
BECAUSE WE'RE
KEEPING THINGS CASUAL.

14:52.326 --> 14:55.633
NONEXCLUSIVE,
NO COMMITMENT.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.114
YOU CAN'T GET TOGETHER
AN EXTRA NIGHT OR 2

14:58.114 --> 14:59.594
AND STILL KEEP THINGS
CASUAL?

14:59.594 --> 15:01.030
THIS IS OUR SYSTEM.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.553
THURSDAYS OFF,
FRIDAYS ON,

15:02.553 --> 15:05.556
AND SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS
WE ALTERNATE.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.558
OHH, I SEE. CASUAL.

15:07.558 --> 15:08.777
MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

15:08.777 --> 15:11.998
HEY, I'M FLEXIBLE.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.217
I CAN CALL HER
WHENEVER I WANT
TO CALL HER.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.785
I'M GOING TO CALL HER
RIGHT NOW.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.964
OK, THAT'S IT.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.879
FOOD IS NOT A TOY.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.837
CLEAR YOUR TRAY,
GO GET CLEANED UP,

15:25.837 --> 15:28.318
OR YOU CAN KISS
THE BOWLING ALLEY
GOOD-BYE.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.019
Man: WHOA!

15:33.019 --> 15:34.542
SORRY.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.153
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

15:37.153 --> 15:38.459
HEY, IS THIS YOUR KID?

15:38.459 --> 15:40.852
YEAH. LOOK, UH,
I'M SORRY.

15:40.852 --> 15:43.594
NO, I LIKE GETTING
ICE CREAM DUMPED
ALL OVER ME.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.509
I SAID I'M SORRY.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.381
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME PAY TO HAVE
THAT CLEANED?

15:47.381 --> 15:50.166
STUPID KID.
SOMEBODY SHOULD SMACK HIM.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.212
HE SAID HE WAS SORRY.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.127
SO JUST LET IT GO
AT THAT.

15:54.127 --> 15:58.479
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I'M WRONG.
MAYBE SOMEBODY NEEDS
TO SMACK YOU.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.003
WE APOLOGIZED,

16:01.003 --> 16:03.484
AND I OFFERED TO MAKE
THINGS RIGHT.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.007
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU FEEL YOU NEED?

16:05.007 --> 16:07.227
NO, FORGET IT.
I'M GOOD.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.750
GREAT.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.144
COME ON.
COME ON.

16:11.144 --> 16:14.669
LET'S GET BAILEY
AND GO BOWLING.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.801
WHO CARES ABOUT BOWLING?

16:16.801 --> 16:19.848
I WANT TO LEARN
HOW TO DO THAT
WRIST THING.

16:27.508 --> 16:30.076
HERE HE IS. SURPRISE.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.426
HEY, UH, I NEED
TO CALL YOU BACK.

16:32.426 --> 16:33.818
OK.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.255
HEY.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.299
HI!

16:36.299 --> 16:38.301
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?

16:38.301 --> 16:40.956
WELL, ME AND MISS DIANA
WERE ON OUR WAY BACK
FROM THE PARK,

16:40.956 --> 16:43.611
AND WE THOUGHT
WE'D SAY HI TO DADDY.

16:43.611 --> 16:48.094
GREAT. IT'S JUST,
UH, IT'S KIND OF CRAZY
AROUND HERE RIGHT NOW.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.052
YEAH, I KNEW THAT
ACTUALLY.

16:50.052 --> 16:54.491
IT'S ALWAYS
SORT OF JUST BEEN
THE ARRANGEMENT

16:54.491 --> 16:57.668
THAT, YOU KNOW,
SHE SLEEPS OVER
AT YOUR GUYS' PLACE,

16:57.668 --> 16:59.540
BUT I WAS THINKING,
YOU KNOW,

16:59.540 --> 17:01.498
BOTH OF YOU ARE
WORKING YOUR BUTTS OFF
SO MUCH THAT

17:01.498 --> 17:05.328
MAYBE IT WOULD
MAKE SENSE, YOU KNOW,
IF SHE WERE TO STAY

17:05.328 --> 17:07.504
A FEW NIGHTS
IN THE WEEK WITH ME.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.115
YOU KNOW, WHAT?

17:09.115 --> 17:11.334
UH, WE'RE OK WITH THE WAY
IT'S WORKING.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.641
IT'S NO PROBLEM FOR US.YEAH, I KNOW.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.382
IT JUST--YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS
SILLY TO WAKE HER UP

17:15.382 --> 17:17.079
SO THAT SHE CAN GO
SLEEP AT YOUR PLACE.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.689
WELL, I JUST FEEL BETTER

17:18.689 --> 17:20.996
KNOWING THE KIND
OF ENVIRONMENT SHE'S IN.

17:26.393 --> 17:29.396
WHAT, UH, WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

17:29.396 --> 17:34.270
DAPH, LOOK, I--
IT'S NOTHING AGAINST HIM.

17:34.270 --> 17:37.447
IT ISN'T, BUT I MEAN,
HOW WELL DO YOU REALLY
KNOW LUKE?

17:37.447 --> 17:39.058
WHAT?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.320
YOU LIKE HIM.
I GET THAT.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.235
I LIKE HIM, TOO,
BUT I MEAN,

17:42.235 --> 17:43.497
WHAT ABOUT LUKE
AND DIANA?

17:43.497 --> 17:44.628
WHAT ABOUT IT?

17:44.628 --> 17:46.456
LUKE IS NOT
HER FATHER.

17:46.456 --> 17:47.805
HE'S LIVING WITH YOU NOW.

17:47.805 --> 17:50.460
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
GO TAKE A SHOWER

17:50.460 --> 17:52.941
OR RUN SOME ERRANDS
AND SHE'S WITH HIM ALONE?

17:52.941 --> 17:56.031
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW HOW HE'S
GOING TO HANDLE A DISCIPLINE
SITUATION?

17:56.031 --> 17:57.554
OR--OR WHAT IF SHE CHOKES?

17:57.554 --> 17:59.643
I MEAN, HAS HE TAKEN
BABY CPR LIKE WE HAVE?

17:59.643 --> 18:01.689
CHARLIE, LUKE IS
SO GREAT WITH HER.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.605
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW GOOD HE IS.

18:04.605 --> 18:08.304
THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT.
I HAVE NO IDEA.

18:08.304 --> 18:12.569
I MEAN, LOOK, YOU'RE ALWAYS
SAYING HOW YOU WANT TO BE
THIS RESPONSIBLE PARENT,

18:12.569 --> 18:16.312
AND MOST OF THE TIME
YOU ARE, BUT THIS TIME,
I'M SORRY, I JUST--

18:16.312 --> 18:19.837
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE MOST
RESPONSIBLE MOVE.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.581
BUT THE MOST AMAZING THING
ABOUT KENYA WAS THE PEOPLE.

18:24.581 --> 18:27.758
I LIVED WITH THE MASAI TRIBE
FOR 6 WEEKS.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.673
I HELPED THEM BUILD HUTS
MADE OF COW DUNG.

18:29.673 --> 18:32.154
I WATCHED THEM
SACRIFICE GOATS.

18:32.154 --> 18:33.286
WOW, THAT MUST'VE BEEN--

18:33.286 --> 18:34.896
INCREDIBLE!
IT WAS. IT WAS.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.464
I MEAN, THESE PEOPLE--
THEY HAVE NO MALL
TO SHOP IN.

18:37.464 --> 18:40.206
THEY ARE COMPLETELY
SELF-SUFFICIENT!

18:40.206 --> 18:43.296
I HAVE TO USE THE REST ROOM,
BUT REMIND ME TO SHOW YOU
MY PHOTO ALBUMS LATER.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.819
AND I HAVE SLIDES, TOO.

18:45.776 --> 18:46.908
MISS ME.

18:46.908 --> 18:49.171
YEAH.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.520
I TELL YOU SHE'S AMAZING?

18:50.520 --> 18:51.695
YOU TOLD ME.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.001
SHE'S REALLY--

18:53.001 --> 18:55.221
I KNOW.
SHE'S A FORCE OF NATURE.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.787
I MEAN, JUST BEING AROUND HER'S
LIKE BEING ON A DRUG.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.267
MM-HMM.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.574
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD TRY CLAUD AGAIN

19:00.574 --> 19:02.402
BEFORE LAURA
COMES BACK.

19:02.402 --> 19:07.755
ACTUALLY, JULIA, I KIND OF
WANTED TO TALK TO YOU...
ABOUT LAURA.

19:07.755 --> 19:10.366
YOU DO?
WHAT ABOUT HER?

19:10.366 --> 19:15.632
WELL, SEE, THE THING IS
IS THAT, I MEAN, SHE HAS
CHANGED MY LIFE.

19:15.632 --> 19:16.720
REALLY.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.548
AND BEING WITH HER,

19:18.548 --> 19:21.769
MY GPA HAS GONE UP.
I'M FINALLY HEADED
IN ONE DIRECTION.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.685
WELL, THAT'S GREAT,
BUT GIVE YOURSELF
SOME CREDIT.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.382
I MEAN,
IT'S NOT ALL HER.

19:26.382 --> 19:30.647
SEE, THE THING THAT I LOVE
MOST ABOUT LAURA IS

19:30.647 --> 19:34.869
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE
OF THESE 5-YEAR PLAN THINGS.

19:34.869 --> 19:37.306
SHE HAS A PLAN
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.699
I BELIEVE IT.

19:38.699 --> 19:40.831
AND I'VE SEEN IT, TOO.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.399
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE HAS
PENCILED IN THERE
AFTER GRADUATION?

19:43.399 --> 19:44.574
WHAT?

19:44.574 --> 19:45.836
ME.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.490
AS IN ME AND HER.

19:47.490 --> 19:48.709
WOW!

19:48.709 --> 19:49.884
I KNOW, SO I'M THINKING,

19:49.884 --> 19:51.320
YOU KNOW, WHY WAIT?

19:51.320 --> 19:53.931
WHY SIT AROUND
AND TALK ABOUT SOMETHING?

19:53.931 --> 19:55.759
YOU JUST GO AHEAD
AND YOU DO IT.

19:55.759 --> 20:00.634
SO YOU'RE SAYING WHAT,
THAT YOU MIGHT
PROPOSE?

20:01.635 --> 20:03.245
I MIGHT.

20:03.245 --> 20:04.942
YEAH.

20:04.942 --> 20:06.944
BUT I WANTED TO SEE
WHAT YOU THOUGHT FIRST.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.164
I WANT TO SEE
IF I'M CRAZY.

20:09.164 --> 20:10.731
BUT YOU GET IT, DON'T YOU?

20:10.731 --> 20:12.950
I MEAN, YOU SEE WHY
I LOVE HER SO MUCH.

20:12.950 --> 20:16.302
WELL, YEAH.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.868
I MEAN, YEAH.
I MEAN, JUSTIN,

20:17.868 --> 20:19.479
HOW COULD I--
HOW COULD I NOT

20:19.479 --> 20:22.873
WHEN SHE'S JUST
SO--HA HA--WELL, YOU KNOW.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.135
SHE'S--YEAH.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.878
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO ME

20:27.878 --> 20:29.184
THAT--HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.056
REALLY.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.147
CHARLIE.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.325
HEY.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.241
HEY.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.592
MUST'VE JUST
DOZED OFF.

21:29.592 --> 21:33.074
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
TRYING TO WORK
THESE NUMBERS.

21:33.074 --> 21:34.989
WHERE'S DIANA?

21:39.210 --> 21:40.995
SHE WAS JUST
PLAYING ON THAT RUG.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.128
DIANA?

21:44.912 --> 21:46.043
DIANA?

21:46.043 --> 21:49.264
SWEETIE,
WHERE ARE YOU?

21:49.264 --> 21:52.049
THERE YOU ARE,
YOU SILLY GIRL.

21:53.790 --> 21:58.621
OK, YOU'VE MADE
QUITE A MESS HERE,
HAVEN'T YOU?

21:58.621 --> 22:00.667
I WAS ONLY ASLEEP
FOR A SECOND.

22:00.667 --> 22:04.279
WELL, SHE'S WAY
INTO TOILET PAPER
THESE DAYS.

22:04.279 --> 22:07.978
AREN'T YOU, BOO?
AREN'T YOU?
YES!

22:07.978 --> 22:10.590
OK, WAVE GOOD-BYE
TO DADDY.

22:10.590 --> 22:14.420
LOOK, DAPH,
THIS--THIS NEVER
HAPPENS, OK?

22:14.420 --> 22:16.247
I MEAN, I'VE JUST
BEEN SO EXHAUSTED

22:16.247 --> 22:18.380
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
THIS PROBLEM WITH
WORK AND...

22:18.380 --> 22:20.948
YEAH, I KNOW.
STUFF HAPPENS.

22:20.948 --> 22:23.516
EVEN TO RESPONSIBLE
PARENTS.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.521
SO, YOU ALL CLEAR
ON THE SOCIAL LANDSCAPE?

22:28.521 --> 22:30.349
I THINK SO.
LET'S SEE,

22:30.349 --> 22:32.220
DURFEE'S IS WHERE
THE SUGAR AND CAFFEINE
ADDICTS HANG OUT.

22:32.220 --> 22:33.700
CHECK.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.354
AND FOR YOUR SALT
AND FAT FIENDS?

22:35.354 --> 22:36.833
UH...
NAPLES? RIGHT?

22:36.833 --> 22:39.140
HEY, THERE'S HOPE
FOR YOU, SALINGER.

22:39.140 --> 22:42.012
SO, ARE YOU SURE
IT'S NO HASSLE IF I
TAG ALONG TO YOUR CLASS?

22:42.012 --> 22:43.971
NOT AS LONG
AS YOU PROMISE
TO TAKE GOOD NOTES.

22:43.971 --> 22:46.495
OH, OK, SO THAT'S WHY
YOU GIVE THESE TOURS, HUH?

22:46.495 --> 22:48.497
TO FIND GOOD
NOTE-TAKING SLAVES?

22:48.497 --> 22:49.803
WHAT SLAVE?

22:49.803 --> 22:52.458
I JUST BOUGHT YOU
A DOUBLE-MINT LATTE.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.329
OOH, WE GOTTA GO.

22:54.329 --> 22:55.678
OH, OK.
HERE.

22:55.678 --> 22:58.159
PUT THIS ON.
NO, I'M OK.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.595
TRUST ME, WE GOTTA
WALK ALL THE WAY
TO SCIENCE HILL.

22:59.595 --> 23:00.814
THAT BLAZER ALONE
WON'T CUT IT.

23:00.814 --> 23:02.859
THANK YOU, BUT--COME ON, TAKE IT.

23:02.859 --> 23:05.166
I GET IN BIG TROUBLE
IF VISITORS DIE
OF PNEUMONIA

23:05.166 --> 23:06.472
BEFORE THEY FILL OUT
AN APPLICATION.

23:07.995 --> 23:09.866
IT'S A LONG WALK,
YOU SAID?
YEAH.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.259
I SHOULD JUST USE
THE REST ROOM.

23:11.259 --> 23:12.434
YEAH, THERE'S ONE
ON THE WAY.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.874
SEE, IT'S NOT
ABOUT KICKING
AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

23:17.874 --> 23:19.310
IT'S ABOUT
FOOT PLACEMENT.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.573
LIKE BALLET.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.358
OK, FORGET BALLET.

23:23.358 --> 23:24.533
YOU TRY.

23:28.102 --> 23:29.930
YEAH!
NOT BAD.

23:29.930 --> 23:31.366
YOU'RE GETTIN' IT.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.759
NOW, WHAT'S
RULE NUMBER ONE?

23:32.759 --> 23:35.326
ONLY USE SELF-DEFENSE
TO DEFEND YOURSELF.

23:35.326 --> 23:36.632
THAT'S RIGHT.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.373
VIOLENCE IS ALWAYS
THE LAST RESORT.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.114
YOU USE YOUR WORDS,
AND YOU USE THEM AGAIN,

23:40.114 --> 23:41.507
AND THEN,
AND ONLY THEN--

23:41.507 --> 23:43.030
CAN YOU SHOW ME
A FLYING SCISSOR-LOCK?

23:43.030 --> 23:45.467
EXCUSE ME?

23:45.467 --> 23:47.600
WILL AND I SAW
THE ASIAN ASSASSIN

23:47.600 --> 23:49.602
DO IT ON
THE WRESTLING DEATH MATCH.

23:49.602 --> 23:52.039
JUST IN CASE
MY WORDS DON'T WORK.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.353
WHOA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

24:02.353 --> 24:03.964
I WAS WAITING
FOR YOU.

24:03.964 --> 24:05.444
WHY?

24:05.444 --> 24:08.621
WELL, CLASS
IS AN HOUR

24:08.621 --> 24:10.927
AND I JUST
COULDN'T WAIT TO--

24:10.927 --> 24:12.799
WHOA, WAIT.

24:12.799 --> 24:16.150
I SMILE AT YOUR JOKES
AND I TAKE YOUR SCARF

24:16.150 --> 24:17.499
AND SUDDENLY
I'M YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

24:17.499 --> 24:20.328
NO! NO, CLAUDIA,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I--

24:20.328 --> 24:22.678
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T
A GIRL JUST BE
FRIENDLY WITH A GUY

24:22.678 --> 24:24.288
WITHOUT ASKING HIM
TO COME AFTER HER?

24:24.288 --> 24:25.464
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU--?

24:25.464 --> 24:29.555
THIS IS A CO-ED
BATHROOM.

24:31.426 --> 24:33.994
I CAME IN HERE TO PEE.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.563
OH, MAN, WHAT IS
THE MATTER WITH ME?

24:37.563 --> 24:38.912
NO, IT--IT'S OK.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.696
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF GIRLS
GET FREAKED OUT

24:40.696 --> 24:41.915
WHEN THEY SEE
GUYS IN HERE.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.265
I HAVE TO GO.

24:44.265 --> 24:45.484
CLAUDIA...

24:51.054 --> 24:54.101
HEY,
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

24:54.101 --> 25:00.063
YEAH. BEEN MISSING
MY 2 BEST GIRLS LATELY.

25:00.063 --> 25:02.065
WELL, GIVE ME
A COUPLE OF MINUTES
TO EAT SOME DINNER

25:02.065 --> 25:03.937
AND THEN I'LL TAKE HER
SO THAT YOU CAN WORK, OK?

25:03.937 --> 25:06.592
THERE'S NO RUSH.
I'M NOT GONNA
WORK TONIGHT.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.115
REALLY?

25:08.115 --> 25:09.464
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU FIGURED OUT
HOW TO BUILD IT?

25:09.464 --> 25:14.077
UM, NO, ACTUALLY,
I DIDN'T,

25:14.077 --> 25:17.385
SO I, UH, TOLD GUS
TO PUT IT ON HOLD
FOR A WHILE.

25:17.385 --> 25:18.821
ON HOLD?

25:18.821 --> 25:20.606
TILL WHEN?

25:20.606 --> 25:23.217
JUST TILL, UH,
THINGS SETTLE DOWN
A LITTLE BIT.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.001
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:25.001 --> 25:26.829
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TAKING THIS STUFF
TO THE EXPO.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.265
THE EXPO'S NEXT WEEK,
RIGHT?

25:28.265 --> 25:29.484
YEAH.

25:29.484 --> 25:31.704
WELL, I TRIED
TO FIND A WAY

25:31.704 --> 25:33.009
TO MAKE THIS THING WORK

25:33.009 --> 25:34.707
WITHOUT MACHINING
THE HEADBOARDS

25:34.707 --> 25:36.491
OR BUYING
PREWELDED FRAMES

25:36.491 --> 25:38.580
OR A HUNDRED
OF OTHER SHORTCUTS.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.060
I'M JUST...

25:40.060 --> 25:42.410
OUT OF IDEAS.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.020
SO YOU'RE JUST
GIVING UP?

25:44.020 --> 25:46.066
NO, I'M NOT
GIVING UP.

25:46.066 --> 25:49.896
I JUST, UH,
I JUST DON'T HAVE
THE TIME RIGHT NOW.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.898
I MEAN, I'VE ALREADY GOT
A FULL-TIME JOB

25:51.898 --> 25:53.900
AND THEN THERE'S
YOUR SURGERY TOMORROW

25:53.900 --> 25:56.163
AND THERE'S DIANA
TO THINK ABOUT.

25:56.163 --> 25:59.558
BUT THOSE THINGS CAN ALL
BE WORKED OUT, CHARLIE.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.995
I MEAN, OK,
SO IT'S A CHALLENGE.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.605
SO WHAT?

26:03.605 --> 26:06.434
YOU CAN'T
JUST DROP OUT

26:06.434 --> 26:08.697
THE FIRST TIME
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT MIGHT NOT WORK.

26:08.697 --> 26:11.395
KIRSTEN, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

26:11.395 --> 26:13.615
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN ON MY CASE
ABOUT THIS FOR WEEKS NOW.

26:13.615 --> 26:16.531
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DREAMING
ABOUT THIS?

26:16.531 --> 26:18.359
YEARS.

26:18.359 --> 26:20.056
SINCE BEFORE
YOUR COMPANY
WENT TO SEATTLE.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.797
AND HOW MANY CHANCES
HAVE YOU HAD SINCE THEN?

26:21.797 --> 26:24.278
JUST THIS ONE.
AM I RIGHT?

26:24.278 --> 26:28.021
LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING
TO TELL YOU HOW
TO LIVE YOUR LIFE.

26:28.021 --> 26:30.458
I JUST...

26:30.458 --> 26:33.983
I HATE TO WATCH YOU
LET THIS OPPORTUNITY
GO BY.

26:33.983 --> 26:35.681
IF YOU'RE GIVING UP
ON THIS ONE,

26:35.681 --> 26:38.031
I HOPE IT'S
FOR A GOOD REASON.

26:38.031 --> 26:42.252
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

26:42.252 --> 26:44.428
YOU KNOW WHAT, CHARLIE?

26:44.428 --> 26:46.692
YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

26:58.094 --> 27:00.096
HEY. READY
TO HIT THE TOWN?

27:00.096 --> 27:02.533
UH, JUST ABOUT.
JUST FINISHING UP HERE.

27:02.533 --> 27:05.058
MMM. SO HOW WAS
YOUR DAY?

27:05.058 --> 27:06.407
WELL, GOOD.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.583
I HAVE TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

27:08.583 --> 27:12.152
WHAT EXACTLY IS
OUR POLICY ON DATING?

27:12.152 --> 27:18.506
OH, AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE
UP TO THE MAXIMUM
PERMITTED WITHIN

27:18.506 --> 27:21.901
A CASUAL,
NONEXCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIP.

27:21.901 --> 27:24.599
REALLY?
IT'S THAT OPEN?

27:24.599 --> 27:27.123
OH, YEAH.
OPEN BETWEEN
EACH OTHER.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.125
OH, RIGHT, YEAH.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.910
OF COURSE.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.912
YOU MEANT BETWEEN
OTHER PEOPLE.

27:32.912 --> 27:34.783
NO, I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T.

27:34.783 --> 27:37.220
I JUST--I COULDN'T REMEMBER
WHAT WE HAD SAID.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.527
DO YOU WANT TO ASK
SOMEONE ELSE OUT, BAILEY?

27:39.527 --> 27:42.312
NO, NOT AT ALL.
I DON'T.

27:42.312 --> 27:44.271
WHY, DO YOU?

27:44.271 --> 27:46.273
NO. I'M SORRY TO SAY
THAT YOU'RE THE BEST

27:46.273 --> 27:48.144
I'VE COME UP WITH
SO FAR.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.495
BUT IF YOU DID,

27:51.495 --> 27:55.108
IF YOU DID WANT TO ASK
SOMEBODY ELSE OUT,
WOULD YOU TELL ME?

27:55.108 --> 27:56.675
WELL, WOULD YOU
WANT ME TO?

27:58.198 --> 28:00.113
YEAH, I WOULD.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.028
WELL, THEN I WILL.

28:02.028 --> 28:03.812
OK.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.120
WHAT?

28:07.120 --> 28:10.340
HOLLY, WHERE WERE YOU
LAST NIGHT?

28:10.340 --> 28:13.126
I TRIED CALLING
3 TIMES.

28:13.126 --> 28:16.172
I WAS OUT
WITH A FRIEND FROM WORK.

28:16.172 --> 28:19.175
A C-T RESIDENT ACTUALLY.
WHY?

28:19.175 --> 28:21.090
SO YOU WORK WITH HIM?

28:21.090 --> 28:24.833
WHO SAYS THAT HE
IS A HIM?

28:27.314 --> 28:29.533
HOLLY, I SAW HIM.

28:29.533 --> 28:32.928
OK. HEY, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT.

28:32.928 --> 28:34.408
IT WAS WITHIN OUR
AGREEMENT, BUT YOU JUST
GOT FINISHED SAYING

28:34.408 --> 28:36.236
THAT YOU WOULD TELL ME
THE TRUTH--

28:36.236 --> 28:37.846
YOU WERE SPYING ON ME?

28:37.846 --> 28:39.065
NO, I WASN'T SPYING
ON YOU.

28:39.065 --> 28:40.283
I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

28:40.283 --> 28:42.546
AND I CALLED
AND I GOT YOUR MACHINE,

28:42.546 --> 28:44.287
SO I FIGURED I WOULD
JUST COME BY AND SURPRISE YOU.

28:44.287 --> 28:46.637
YOU WERE LURKING AROUND
OUTSIDE MY HOUSE?

28:46.637 --> 28:49.031
HOLLY, RELAX.AND WHAT?

28:49.031 --> 28:51.947
I MEAN, I KISSED A COLLEAGUE
GOOD NIGHT ON THE CHEEK,

28:51.947 --> 28:53.601
AND NOW I GET ALL
THESE WEIRD INNUENDOS.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.081
HOLLY, I'M ONLY S--

28:55.081 --> 28:57.561
NO. GOD, THIS IS--
THIS IS JUST FANTASTIC.

28:57.561 --> 28:59.215
I MEAN, IT'S SO NICE
TO KNOW YOU HAVE

28:59.215 --> 29:01.609
ALL THIS DEEP, INVESTED
FAITH IN ME.

29:01.609 --> 29:05.004
NO. GOD, I'M GOING
TO LEAVE BEFORE I SAY
SOMETHING I DON'T REGRET.

29:05.004 --> 29:06.745
HOLLY, WAIT. HOLLY.

29:13.099 --> 29:15.362
SO I'M SITTING THERE
THINKING, "NO,
DON'T DO IT.

29:15.362 --> 29:16.972
PLEASE DON'T
PROPOSE TO HER."

29:16.972 --> 29:18.626
I MEAN, GOD, HE ONLY
JUST MET HER.

29:18.626 --> 29:19.845
AND LAURA, I MEAN,
SHE'S FINE.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.498
SHE'S JUST
A LITTLE PUSHY.

29:21.498 --> 29:22.891
BUT IT'S LIKE HE'S OBSESSED
WITH HER OR SOMETHING.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.371
NOT THAT I'M JEALOUS.
I'M TOTALLY NOT.

29:24.371 --> 29:25.938
I MEAN, IF HE'S HAPPY,
THAT'S GREAT,

29:25.938 --> 29:27.548
BUT THE THING IS

29:27.548 --> 29:29.506
I STILL FEEL LIKE I SHOULD'VE
BEEN HONEST WITH HIM.

29:29.506 --> 29:30.899
YOU KNOW?

29:30.899 --> 29:32.596
I FEEL LIKE
HE'S RUSHING INTO IT,

29:32.596 --> 29:34.555
AND BECAUSE I JUST SAT THERE
AND I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING--

29:34.555 --> 29:36.905
JULIA, I REALLY DON'T CARE.

29:36.905 --> 29:38.385
WHAT?

29:38.385 --> 29:40.909
I'VE HAD A VERY BAD DAY,

29:40.909 --> 29:43.172
AND I JUST...

29:43.172 --> 29:45.044
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I'M HERE.

29:45.044 --> 29:48.003
OH, HEY, I'M SORRY,
WHAT HAPPENED?

29:48.003 --> 29:49.265
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.701
WELL, OF COURSE I DO.

29:50.701 --> 29:54.053
WELL, ANYWAY, I JUST FIGURED
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT

29:54.053 --> 29:55.837
I'M FLYING BACK
TOMORROW MORNING.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.708
WHAT? CLAUDIA, TOMORROW?
WHAT ABOUT COLUMBIA?

29:57.708 --> 29:59.058
WHAT ABOUT NYU?

29:59.058 --> 30:00.842
I CHANGED MY MIND.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.191
I JUST--

30:02.191 --> 30:04.672
I WANT TO GO BACK,
SO YOU CAN COME

30:04.672 --> 30:06.239
OR YOU CAN STAY
WITH JUSTIN, WHATEVER.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.632
WAIT. HOLD ON. I DON'T
UNDERSTAND. WHAT HAPPENED?

30:08.632 --> 30:10.286
COULD WE NOT?

30:10.286 --> 30:14.073
OK? I'M TIRED AND I JUST WANT
TO GO BACK TO MY ROOM.

30:14.073 --> 30:18.425
CLAUDIA, TALK TO ME.
TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO
AND I'LL DO IT.

30:18.425 --> 30:21.384
CAN YOU TRAVEL BACK IN TIME

30:21.384 --> 30:24.518
AND STOP ME FROM GOING
INTO THAT ROOM WITH DERRICK?

30:26.259 --> 30:28.914
CAN YOU DO THAT, JULIA?

30:30.350 --> 30:32.265
NO, I CAN'T.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.748
THEN YOU CAN'T HELP ME.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.379
HEY.
HEY.

30:59.379 --> 31:01.033
UM, DAPHNE'S AT THE STORE,

31:01.033 --> 31:02.034
BUT SHE'S GOING
TO BE RIGHT BACK.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.122
OK.

31:03.122 --> 31:05.254
HEY, THERE, LADY BUG.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.952
HI.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.695
HI. HI.

31:11.695 --> 31:14.655
SO, UH,
HOW'S IT GOING?

31:14.655 --> 31:17.440
NOT BAD. OK.
NO COMPLAINTS.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.443
WHAT'S THAT?

31:20.443 --> 31:23.011
WELL, UM, I GUESS I
SHOULD GET GOING THEN.

31:23.011 --> 31:26.275
OH, UM, KIRSTEN LEFT
HER DIAPER BAG HERE,

31:26.275 --> 31:28.234
SO YOU WANT TO
COME GET IT?

31:28.234 --> 31:29.888
OK.

31:31.193 --> 31:32.716
IT'S RIGHT--
HERE WE ARE.

31:32.716 --> 31:35.023
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.420
WOW.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.812
DID YOU DO ALL THIS?

31:41.812 --> 31:43.684
OH, YEAH. I WAS GOING
TO GET SOME OF THEM

31:43.684 --> 31:46.208
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK
STICKERS, BUT, YEAH,
IT'S GETTING THERE, HUH?

31:46.208 --> 31:48.863
THIS MUST'VE TAKEN
SOME TIME.

31:48.863 --> 31:51.300
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

31:51.300 --> 31:52.867
SO, LISTEN, IF IT'S EASIER,

31:52.867 --> 31:55.130
I CAN JUST DROP DIANA
BY YOUR PLACE TONIGHT.

31:55.130 --> 31:56.610
SAVE YOU A TRIP.

31:56.610 --> 31:59.221
UH...

31:59.221 --> 32:01.136
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ACTUALLY KIRSTEN

32:01.136 --> 32:03.269
COULD PROBABLY USE
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
TONIGHT,

32:03.269 --> 32:07.273
SO, UH, WOULD
YOU AND DAPHNE MIND
TAKING HER OVERNIGHT?

32:07.273 --> 32:10.058
SURE YOU'RE OK WITH THAT?

32:10.058 --> 32:13.670
YEAH. YEAH, THAT'D
HELP US OUT A LOT.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.456
YEAH, SURE. YEAH.

32:16.456 --> 32:20.155
OK.

32:20.155 --> 32:23.289
SO IF YOU COULD
JUST TELL DAPH, UH...

32:24.986 --> 32:27.467
JUST TELL HER THAT
I SAID THANKS.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.599
OK.

32:35.214 --> 32:38.391
SHE TOOK OFF FOR HER
INFORMATIONAL
INTERVIEW.

32:38.391 --> 32:40.175
SHE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?

32:40.175 --> 32:42.177
HOW WOULD I KNOW?
SHE WON'T TALK TO ME.

32:42.177 --> 32:44.788
IF YOU WANT TO GO FIND HER,
LAURA WON'T MIND.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.486
WE CAN HAVE LUNCH LATER
OR WE CAN JUST MEET
FOR DINNER.

32:46.486 --> 32:49.054
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE I SHOULD
DO THAT. OK?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.446
OK.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.231
OH, JULIA.

32:52.231 --> 32:54.537
UM, THANK YOU.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.061
WHY? WHAT FOR?

32:56.061 --> 32:57.714
WELL, FOR WHAT
YOU SAID LAST NIGHT.

32:57.714 --> 33:00.674
IT REALLY HELPED ME
MAKE A DECISION.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.023
IT DID?

33:02.023 --> 33:04.765
YEAH, I THINK
I MADE UP MY MIND.

33:04.765 --> 33:08.116
I'M GOING TO ASK LAURA
TO MARRY ME.

33:10.292 --> 33:11.815
WOW, JUSTIN.

33:13.034 --> 33:14.383
WHEN?

33:14.383 --> 33:16.298
WHO KNOWS?
MAYBE AT LUNCH.

33:16.298 --> 33:19.258
NO TIME LIKE
THE PRESENT, HUH?

33:22.087 --> 33:24.002
CONGRATULATIONS.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.655
THANK YOU.

33:28.745 --> 33:29.877
I LOVE YOU.

33:29.877 --> 33:32.184
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

33:38.146 --> 33:39.234
HEY.

33:39.234 --> 33:40.496
HEY.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.063
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.630
THAT'S BECAUSE I HAD TO PICK
OWEN UP FROM SCHOOL.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.327
FROM THE PRINCIPAL'S
OFFICE.

33:45.327 --> 33:46.894
SEEMS HE KICKED
ANOTHER KID
IN THE CHEST

33:46.894 --> 33:48.417
ON THE PLAYGROUND
TODAY.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.028
OH. UM...

33:50.028 --> 33:52.204
THAT WOULD BE
MORGAN TWOMBLEY.

33:52.204 --> 33:55.294
IF THERE WAS
A PROBLEM AT SCHOOL,
VICTOR,

33:55.294 --> 33:57.339
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT IT?

33:57.339 --> 33:59.298
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
A LITTLE DISTRACTED LATELY.

33:59.298 --> 34:03.432
PLUS WHICH,
OWEN ASKED ME NOT TO.

34:03.432 --> 34:05.478
HE DIDN'T WANT YOU
CALLING THE SCHOOL.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.262
GREAT. SO INSTEAD
THE SCHOOL CALLS ME.

34:07.262 --> 34:09.525
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING ANYWAY,

34:09.525 --> 34:11.136
TEACHING HIM
HOW TO FIGHT?

34:11.136 --> 34:13.181
I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST FELT RIGHT.

34:13.181 --> 34:16.532
IT FELT RIGHT TO TELL HIM
THAT IT'S OK TO SOLVE
HIS PROBLEMS THAT WAY?

34:16.532 --> 34:18.230
YEAH, IF HE'S TRIED
EVERYTHING ELSE,

34:18.230 --> 34:20.058
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S OK.WELL, I DON'T.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.972
IT JUST
I'VE BEEN THERE, YOU KNOW?

34:21.972 --> 34:25.454
I MEAN, I LOOK AT A KID
LIKE OWN WALKING AROUND
AFRAID...

34:25.454 --> 34:29.632
I SPENT TOO MANY YEARS
THAT WAY,

34:29.632 --> 34:32.200
SCARED TO LOOK
AT OTHER KIDS IN THE EYE,

34:32.200 --> 34:34.376
ASHAMED.

34:34.376 --> 34:38.641
I MEAN, MAYBE YOU DON'T
SEE IT THAT WAY,

34:38.641 --> 34:41.470
BUT I THINK A PERSON
SHOULD FACE THEIR FEARS,

34:41.470 --> 34:44.125
NO MATTER WHAT.

34:46.693 --> 34:49.957
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
I MADE IT THROUGH.

34:58.444 --> 35:01.969
THEY TOLD ME
YOU CANCELED YOUR
MEETING WITH THE DEAN.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.450
YEAH.

35:04.450 --> 35:07.366
LISTEN, CLAUD,
LAST NIGHT YOU LEFT

35:07.366 --> 35:09.629
WITHOUT TELLING ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

35:09.629 --> 35:11.500
NOW, I DON'T KNOW,

35:11.500 --> 35:14.938
MAYBE--MAYBE IF YOU
EXPLAIN IT TO ME,

35:14.938 --> 35:16.026
THEN--

35:16.026 --> 35:17.376
I CAN'T.

35:17.376 --> 35:18.986
WHY NOT?

35:19.943 --> 35:21.336
'CAUSE I CAN'T,

35:21.336 --> 35:22.903
SO PLEASE STOP ASKING ME.

35:22.903 --> 35:24.252
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

35:24.252 --> 35:26.254
NO, I WON'T
LEAVE YOU ALONE.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.734
I WON'T LET YOU
SAY NOTHING.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.388
YOU HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING,
CLAUDIA.

35:29.388 --> 35:31.216
JUST GO AWAY.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.218
CLAUDIA, WILL YOU STOP?
JUST STOP FOR A MINUTE.

35:33.218 --> 35:36.786
DON'T YOU THINK
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU?

35:36.786 --> 35:41.400
OK, SO TALK TO ME THEN.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.141
I CAN'T.

35:45.317 --> 35:48.102
I CAN'T TALK
TO YOU BECAUSE--

35:49.973 --> 35:52.454
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.804
I'M A MESS.

35:54.804 --> 35:58.982
AND I'M SO CONFUSED.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.376
OK, SO DON'T--DON'T TALK.

36:01.376 --> 36:04.205
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

36:04.205 --> 36:07.121
IT'S OK.

36:07.121 --> 36:09.428
[CRYING]

36:24.921 --> 36:26.140
HEY.

36:26.140 --> 36:27.620
HI.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.189
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

36:31.189 --> 36:36.194
KINDA TIRED. OK.

36:37.717 --> 36:39.371
I SPOKE WITH DR. VASQUEZ,

36:39.371 --> 36:41.329
AND HE SAID THE PROCEDURE
WENT REALLY WELL.

36:41.329 --> 36:46.160
DOES HE THINK THAT
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET PREGNANT?

36:46.160 --> 36:48.554
HE DIDN'T MAKE
ANY PROMISES,

36:48.554 --> 36:51.470
BUT HE THINKS
WE'VE GOT A REAL SHOT.

36:51.470 --> 36:54.255
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WEIRD?

36:54.255 --> 37:00.000
FOR SOME REASON,
THAT SCARES ME.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.220
IT DOES? WHY?

37:02.220 --> 37:08.182
WELL,THE DOCTORS
HAVE DONE THEIR THING.

37:08.182 --> 37:11.446
THERE'S NO MORE
EXCUSES.

37:11.446 --> 37:14.536
IT'S ALL UP TO ME NOW.

37:14.536 --> 37:17.626
KIRSTEN, YOU SHOULDN'T
FEEL THAT WAY,

37:17.626 --> 37:19.802
LIKE YOU NEED EXCUSES.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.978
COME ON. YOU'VE DONE
EVERYTHING YOU POSSIBLY CAN

37:21.978 --> 37:23.676
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN FOR US.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.765
YOU'VE BEEN SO BRAVE.

37:27.767 --> 37:31.901
IN FACT, I COULD STAND
TO TAKE A LESSON FROM YOU.

37:31.901 --> 37:34.774
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:36.297 --> 37:40.214
WELL, LAST NIGHT
YOU WERE RIGHT.

37:40.214 --> 37:43.739
IT'S BEEN 5 YEARS
SINCE I'VE HAD THE SHOT
THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW,

37:43.739 --> 37:47.961
AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE,
I STARTED TO WONDER
IF I COULD DO IT,

37:47.961 --> 37:51.530
IF THE LUCK I HAD
BACK THEN WAS JUST--

37:51.530 --> 37:53.009
LUCK.

37:53.009 --> 37:55.098
DON'T START DOUBTING.

37:55.098 --> 37:57.840
ALWAYS HAVING ALL THESE
HUGE OBLIGATIONS--
THIS FAMILY TO TAKE CARE OF--

37:57.840 --> 38:00.930
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
THE PERFECT REASON
NOT TO TRY.

38:00.930 --> 38:03.237
BUT NOW THERE'S NOTHING
KEEPING ME FROM THIS.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.673
I HAVE NO MORE EXCUSES.

38:04.673 --> 38:06.893
YOU DON'T NEED
EXCUSES, CHARLIE.

38:06.893 --> 38:08.808
YOU JUST NEED
TO DO IT.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.026
I KNOW THAT.

38:11.898 --> 38:14.466
WHAT IF I CAN'T?

38:27.392 --> 38:30.699
HEY. I'M NOT
SPYING ON YOU.

38:30.699 --> 38:33.093
OK? I JUST CAME HERE
TO TALK TO YOU.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.225
OK?

38:35.225 --> 38:38.359
I'VE BEEN THINKING
A LOT ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

38:38.359 --> 38:39.665
YEAH, ME, TOO.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.406
OK. WELL,
LET ME GO FIRST.

38:41.406 --> 38:42.755
PLEASE.

38:42.755 --> 38:44.670
I'VE BEEN ACTING
LIKE AN IDIOT.

38:44.670 --> 38:48.151
OK? I KNOW THAT,
BUT THERE'S THE REASON
THAT I HAVE.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.981
I'VE BEEN SCARED,

38:51.981 --> 38:54.288
HOLLY, THAT'S ALL.

38:54.288 --> 38:56.377
I'VE BEEN SCARED
OF LOSING YOU.

38:56.377 --> 38:58.292
LISTEN, BAILEY--

38:58.292 --> 39:00.120
WHICH IS HARDER FOR ME
THAT IT IS FOR SOME
OTHER PEOPLE

39:00.120 --> 39:02.035
FOR A LOT OF REASONS,
BUT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

39:02.035 --> 39:04.037
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT,

39:04.037 --> 39:07.257
I'M JUST GETTING OVER
THE LAST RELATIONSHIP
THAT I LOST.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.650
YEAH.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.609
I'VE BEEN AWARE OF THAT.

39:10.609 --> 39:13.438
WHICH IS WHY I KNOW NOW
THAT I WANT TO CHANGE
ALL OF THAT.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.135
OK? JUST FACE THAT FEAR.

39:15.135 --> 39:18.443
I WANT US TO BE
EXCLUSIVE NOW.

39:18.443 --> 39:22.360
HOLLY, I DON'T WANT US
TO BE CASUAL ANYMORE.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.493
OK? BECAUSE WHATEVER
IT IS THAT I HAVE BEEN
HIDING FROM,

39:25.493 --> 39:28.322
HIDING FROM IT
IS NOT GOING TO FIX
ANYTHING.

39:28.322 --> 39:30.977
NEITHER IS THIS.

39:30.977 --> 39:34.459
YOU JUST SAID IT
A SECOND AGO.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.156
YOU'RE NOT OVER HER.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.549
I KNOW,
BUT I'M GETTING THERE.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.159
OK? WHICH IS WHY
I WANT US TO DO THIS.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.421
DO WHAT?

39:40.421 --> 39:44.077
WE'LL HAVE
A REBOUND RELATIONSHIP

39:44.077 --> 39:45.905
TO DULL THE PAIN?

39:45.905 --> 39:47.689
HOLLY, WAIT.

39:47.689 --> 39:50.431
IT'S OK. I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN
AS NAIVE AS YOU HAVE.

39:50.431 --> 39:54.348
I MEAN, I HONESTLY BELIEVED
THAT IF I STUCK AROUND
LONG ENOUGH,

39:54.348 --> 39:56.350
THAT TIME WOULD
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

39:56.350 --> 39:58.265
AND IT WILL.

39:58.265 --> 40:00.310
YEAH, EVENTUALLY, MAYBE.

40:01.747 --> 40:05.925
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

40:05.925 --> 40:11.670
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN
STOPPING AND STARTING
FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

40:11.670 --> 40:15.717
AND IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT...

40:15.717 --> 40:18.067
BUT IT'S BREAKING MY HEART.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.242
HOLLY, LISTEN TO ME--

40:19.242 --> 40:20.330
NO.

40:20.330 --> 40:23.856
PLEASE, DON'T.

40:23.856 --> 40:26.598
'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
THAT I WANT MORE

40:26.598 --> 40:29.427
THAN TO BELIEVE
WHATEVER IT IS THAT
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY.

40:33.387 --> 40:36.172
WE'RE BREAKING UP,
AREN'T WE?

40:40.742 --> 40:42.527
YOU NEED TIME.

40:45.486 --> 40:47.575
SO TAKE IT.

40:49.838 --> 40:53.146
AND WHEN YOU'RE READY

40:53.146 --> 40:55.322
TO FALL FOR SOMEONE,

40:55.322 --> 40:58.760
REALLY READY...

40:58.760 --> 41:03.286
I JUST HOPE
I'LL STILL BE AROUND.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.572
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

41:30.183 --> 41:34.056
I WAS JUST HAVING
THIS--THIS DREAM--
THIS FACTORY DREAM,

41:34.056 --> 41:36.363
AND...
AND?

41:36.363 --> 41:38.408
WELL, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO FIND A WAY

41:38.408 --> 41:40.280
TO AFFORD THIS FINISH

41:40.280 --> 41:42.282
THAT'LL MAKE
THIS STUFF FEEL
HIGH-END, RIGHT?

41:42.282 --> 41:45.720
AND IN MY DREAM,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I JUST--

41:45.720 --> 41:47.417
I JUST SAW IT.

41:47.417 --> 41:50.159
FRANK GEHRY LEFT HIS STUFF
UNFINISHED ALL THE TIME

41:50.159 --> 41:52.205
AS A CHOICE, SO...

41:52.205 --> 41:53.598
WHY CAN'T I?

41:53.598 --> 41:56.775
HMM.

41:56.775 --> 41:58.864
THAT'S GREAT, CHARLIE.

41:58.864 --> 42:00.953
YEAH, THAT'S REALLY...

42:02.607 --> 42:04.086
THAT'S REALLY...

42:10.702 --> 42:11.877
JUL?

42:11.877 --> 42:13.052
YEAH?

42:13.052 --> 42:15.924
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

42:15.924 --> 42:17.099
OF COURSE.

42:19.841 --> 42:22.452
AFTER NED...

42:22.452 --> 42:24.629
DID IT TAKE YOU
A LONG TIME

42:24.629 --> 42:27.283
BEFORE YOU FELT LIKE
YOU COULD REALLY
TRUST SOMEONE?

42:28.502 --> 42:31.592
YEAH, IT DID.

42:31.592 --> 42:33.115
THAT'S THE THING.

42:33.115 --> 42:36.292
I FEEL LIKE I DON'T REALLY
KNOW ANYONE.

42:36.292 --> 42:38.251
YOU KNOW?

42:38.251 --> 42:42.037
I THINK I DO,
BUT I CAN'T REALLY
TRUST MY FEELINGS.

42:42.037 --> 42:45.258
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

42:45.258 --> 42:47.434
I KNOW.

42:53.919 --> 42:56.312
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

42:58.837 --> 43:00.403
YEAH.

43:00.403 --> 43:02.101
HE WAS JUST THIS BOY,

43:02.101 --> 43:07.193
THIS VERY FRIENDLY BOY,
LIKE I THOUGHT DEREK WAS.

43:07.193 --> 43:12.372
ANYWAY, THE FIRST DAY HE SHOWED
ME ALL THE COOL STUFF...

43:12.372 --> 43:14.766
HE SOUNDS REALLY NICE.
