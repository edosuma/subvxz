00:09.551 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:14.014


00:14.097 --> 00:15.265


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:32.323 --> 00:34.284


00:34.367 --> 00:37.454


00:38.163 --> 00:40.957


00:43.460 --> 00:45.045


00:46.254 --> 00:48.673
Hmm. I think one
more piece ought to do it.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.677


00:52.761 --> 00:55.305
Sorry, Chuck old buddy,
but this is for your own good.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.766
No, no, that's fine, Red,
I completely understand.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.351
Hey, one quick thing, though.
Could you let me out of here?

01:00.435 --> 01:03.188
I can't do another rainy day
watching <i>Saving Private Flyin'.</i>

01:03.271 --> 01:05.148
I won't do it. You can't make me.

01:05.231 --> 01:09.027
But, Chuck, it's a classic tale
of sacrifice and friendship.

01:09.110 --> 01:11.237
Yeah, the first ten times you see it,

01:11.321 --> 01:13.782
but the next 190 times not so much.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.992
Everyone on your tail feathers.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.744
The movie is starting and, Chuck--

01:18.953 --> 01:21.581
you're on your final warning.
Any nonsense and I'll--

01:21.664 --> 01:24.084
Be a little teensy bit
slightly disappointed?

01:24.167 --> 01:27.170
Send you home without a refund.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.047
And that goes for the rest of you.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.304
Psst! Red, you sure this'll work?

01:36.387 --> 01:38.056
Bomb, of course.

01:38.139 --> 01:41.142
Look, it might seem over-the-top
to tape our friend to the floor,

01:41.226 --> 01:43.812
-but trust me. This is foolproof.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.104
He's gone, isn't he?

01:45.188 --> 01:46.147
Uh-huh.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.276
Chuck better hope that Lynette
finds him first

01:50.360 --> 01:52.445
because when I see him, I'm gonna--

01:52.529 --> 01:56.074
Yeah, let's just get him back before
Lynette realizes he flew the coop.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.742
Whoa! Ack!

01:57.826 --> 01:58.660
Found him!

01:59.786 --> 02:02.497
Come on, Chuck.
We gotta get you back inside.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.375
If Lynette catches you out here,
you're in deep trouble.

02:05.458 --> 02:09.254
Oh, I can't go back in there yet.
I've got a case of the jimmy legs.

02:10.630 --> 02:11.714
The antsies?

02:12.423 --> 02:13.341
Fidget feet!

02:17.846 --> 02:20.557
You know I can't sit still
for hours and hours and hours.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.600
I just need to blow off
a little steam.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.436
I don't think that's a good idea.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.109
Whoo-hoo!

02:31.192 --> 02:33.987
How is he getting up
and down the slide so fast?

02:34.070 --> 02:36.156
Usually, the line takes forever.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.533
Ohh! Because there's no one there!

02:41.953 --> 02:43.413
Hello, anybody?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.249
We have the whole camp to ourselves.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.836
-Good thing too.
-Whoo-hoo!

02:49.919 --> 02:52.714
No one to catch us
before we get Chuck back inside--

02:52.797 --> 02:55.633
Well, yeah, sure, we could do that. Or…

02:57.427 --> 02:58.344
I don't know.

02:58.428 --> 03:02.223
Come on, Red. When are we ever
gonna have this chance again?

03:02.307 --> 03:06.936
It would be a crime against birdmanity
not to enjoy it, just a little.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.731
Can we, Red? Can we please?

03:11.608 --> 03:13.735
Waterslide!

03:18.031 --> 03:19.616
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

03:27.582 --> 03:29.292
Okay, Bomb, do your thing!

03:39.802 --> 03:42.805
This has been great,
but we really have to get back.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.934
So, if there's one thing
you've dreamed of doing

03:46.017 --> 03:47.936
while no one's around do it now.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.562
There is one thing.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.486
That was beautiful.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.199
Chuck, sometimes you're
a splinter in the butt feathers,

04:01.282 --> 04:02.659
but this ain't half bad.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.327
You are welcome.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.205
And whoever came up
with dojo froyos is a genius.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.748
Oh, yeah. That was me, too.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.420
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

04:15.672 --> 04:16.881
Uh, Chuck?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.471
I'm sure that's not going
to be a problem.

04:46.077 --> 04:49.080
Ooh! We're alive! I think.

04:49.163 --> 04:50.164
Phew!

04:57.088 --> 04:58.256
Where are we?

04:58.339 --> 05:00.049
I don't recognize anything.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.259
Hmm.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.511
I see a pig dock and a pig boat…

05:04.721 --> 05:07.223
and that pig sign on that post over there.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.767
So, I got nothing.

05:09.851 --> 05:14.856
Ahh! Birdfeed!
We're at… The Pig Camp!

05:16.357 --> 05:17.900
Really? What makes you say that?

05:17.984 --> 05:20.194
Well, this is just great.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.363
Now, we're all gonna get
chucked out of camp.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.866
I don't want to get chucked out of camp!

05:24.949 --> 05:27.118
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

05:27.201 --> 05:29.287
No more chanting "chuck," Chuck.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.415
We're in big trouble.
It couldn't get any worse.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.295
The heck is that?

05:42.842 --> 05:45.678
It's literally the sound
of things getting worse.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.858
Ugh! There's something
I'll never unsee.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.819
Ugh! My eyes! My eyes!

06:01.903 --> 06:03.571
Get a hold of yourself.

06:03.654 --> 06:07.950
Come on, Chuck. We're trapped behind
enemy lines and we need you to focus.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.744
Okay.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.333
The only way out is through those pigs
and to that dock.

06:15.416 --> 06:19.712
And if there's one thing 200 viewings
of <i>Saving Private Flyin</i>' has taught me--

06:19.796 --> 06:22.006
That Lynette has never heard
of streaming movies?

06:22.090 --> 06:27.595
That too, but also, to evade the enemy,
we must become invisible.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.202
I'm hit! I'm hit!

06:51.285 --> 06:52.703
I'm done for!

06:52.787 --> 06:54.080
This is the end!

06:55.915 --> 07:00.253
Bomb, I never told you,
but I borrowed your underwear.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.296
I don't wear underwear.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.882
Neither do I!

07:04.966 --> 07:06.801
Chuck. It's just mud.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.720
You're right. Sorry.

07:09.804 --> 07:13.057
I just gotta keep a lid on things
and everything will be fine.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.225
No problem.

07:14.308 --> 07:17.478
Come on lid, stay on.
Stay on, stay on.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.608
Nope! Lid's coming off.
We're not gonna make it!

07:24.735 --> 07:25.903
Oopsie.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.114
And now we're gonna end up pig chow.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.243
Ohh! The sun's coming out!

07:32.326 --> 07:34.829
If it stops raining, everyone will
come out of the dining hall

07:34.912 --> 07:36.414
and realize we're missing.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.291
We gotta get back to camp now!

07:38.374 --> 07:41.127
-Ahh!

07:41.210 --> 07:43.588
We'll never get past these pigs in time.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.506
Not with that attitude.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.343
This is all my fault.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.678
You were trying to save me

07:50.761 --> 07:53.431
'cause I couldn't sit still
through a movie I hate.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.850
Now you'll all get kicked out of camp.

07:55.933 --> 08:00.438
Or worse, eaten by mud-frenzied pigs,
and that's why--

08:01.272 --> 08:04.108
Couldn't even sit still
long enough to finish his speech.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.194
Classic Chuck.

08:06.277 --> 08:09.405
-How could he abandon us like this?
-Uh, that's how.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.160
Chuck?

08:14.243 --> 08:17.288
-Chuck! What the heck are you doing?

08:17.371 --> 08:20.958
I got you into this mess,
so it's my job to get you out.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.336
Chuck, no!

08:25.421 --> 08:28.716
I am Num Chuck, ruler of the Mud Kingdom.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.927
Kneel before me.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.262
I think it's working.

08:34.931 --> 08:35.765
Uh-oh.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.227
-No, they're totally gonna eat him.

08:39.310 --> 08:41.437
Chuck, there's gotta be another way.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.147
You gotta let him go, Bomb.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.316
He's making the ultimate sacrifice.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.570
Let's make it count. Come on.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.793
Hey, that tickles. Hey, come on, quit it.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.588
Forget everything I ever said about him.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.174
He was the best friend a bird could have.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.761
Do you think we'll ever
see his weird, goofy face again?

09:13.844 --> 09:14.845
Maybe next summer,

09:14.929 --> 09:16.931
because even if he gets out alive,

09:17.014 --> 09:18.891
he's definitely
getting kicked out of camp.

09:19.475 --> 09:23.521
Chuck. Chuck. Chuck.
Chuck. Chuck.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.400
We made it.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.611
-Keisha. Diane.
-They're already taking attendance.

09:30.695 --> 09:36.784
Isabella. Rufus. Red. Stella. Bomb.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.204
Isn't there someone else
who's usually with you?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.790
Yellow, drools a lot. Chuck!

09:42.873 --> 09:45.251
Yeah. That's his name.
Where's he at?

09:45.334 --> 09:49.046
Harold, let me tell you a story
about sacrifice and friendship.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.798
The story of a total idiot

09:50.881 --> 09:53.593
who was the best friend
a bird could ever have.

09:53.676 --> 09:57.346
I must say, Lynette, that movie
is even better the 201st time.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.974
Really? How many brothers
does Private Flyin' have?

10:00.057 --> 10:01.642
-Three.
-What was his favorite food?

10:01.726 --> 10:02.685
Trick question.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.813
He didn't have a favorite food
'cause he has no taste buds.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.023
Hmm.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.276
Chuck, you made it.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.361
I told you guys I got fidget feet.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.656
Those pigs couldn't outrun me.
Although they do know where we live now.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.241
I'm glad you got back in time.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.161
Honestly, I can't believe
we didn't get busted today.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.955
I know, right?
We totally got away with it.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.082
Nothing to worry about at all.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.001
The Dojo! It's gone!

10:27.084 --> 10:29.170
When I find out who is responsible

10:29.253 --> 10:32.089
they are getting
kicked out of Camp Splinterwood!

10:32.673 --> 10:35.426
Oh, yeah, the Dojo.

10:35.509 --> 10:38.721
Uh, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck…
