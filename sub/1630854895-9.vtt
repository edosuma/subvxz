00:10.301 --> 00:12.721
<i>Could've been
a faulty electrical wire.</i>

00:14.764 --> 00:16.141
Place was all wood.

00:16.141 --> 00:17.851
A tinderbox.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.562
Thing just went up.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.106
Boom.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.275
Verdict's in, bro.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.068
Whoever's up there

00:28.737 --> 00:29.863
does not like you.

00:33.241 --> 00:34.159
Sorry.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.923
Sarah, when did you say
the pilot was getting in?

00:48.923 --> 00:50.633
Probably like an hour?

00:50.633 --> 00:53.887
I mean, once he's here,
my dad says we can leave whenever we want.

00:54.679 --> 00:59.434
Okay, well, as much as I would love
to ghost my parents again, I can't.

00:59.434 --> 01:03.646
Pope, we're talking El Dorado here.
Can you just slip out the back maybe?

01:03.646 --> 01:06.066
- Great advice.
-  It always worked for me.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.401
How to avoid unpleasant circumstances 101.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.403
If there's a problem,
you don't wanna face it,

01:10.403 --> 01:12.822
turn that face and keister around
and walk the other way.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.449
I'm not doing that, okay?

01:15.784 --> 01:18.078
I just want you to be there, dog.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.456
I'm gonna be there.
I'll meet you at the airstrip in an hour?

01:22.040 --> 01:25.418
- Yeah, we'll see you there.
-  One hour, Pope. Not a second later.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.797
Think you should let me talk, Pope.
Think your mom kinda likes me.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.049
I don't think it's gonna be pleasant
for either of us.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.259
I'm gonna take a stroll back to the shack.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.636
For old time's sake.

01:35.386 --> 01:38.723
I always wanted to go to South America.
Great surf, cheap weed.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.433
- Yeah.
-  See you guys on the tarmac.

01:40.433 --> 01:45.355
I guess I'll go pack some stuff
and break the news to my parents.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.150
Hey, Jayj, wait.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.402
Hey. Um...

01:54.697 --> 01:59.869
Just, uh, last night, you were...
you were saying something

01:59.869 --> 02:01.788
before the fire.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.665
I'll tell you what.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.210
- I'll tell you on the plane.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.920
Just to make sure you get on.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.088
- Right.
- Right.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.549
I'm gonna hold you to that.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.510
I'm sure you will.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.262
So glad you're not stalling.

02:34.279 --> 02:38.032
<i>It's something that,
once it's done, cannot be undone.</i>

02:39.409 --> 02:40.994
<i>There's no going back.</i>

02:44.747 --> 02:47.375
<i>Talking about your pops,
talking about your blood.</i>

03:12.942 --> 03:14.319
You're not gonna shoot me, are you?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.405
I need you to leave.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.575
Oh, yeah?
We talked about this already, Rafe.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.789
I need you to go live
your life in Guadeloupe,

03:27.540 --> 03:29.542
and you can let me live mine here.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.088
I'm not gonna do that, okay?

03:39.844 --> 03:40.762
You realize...

03:43.890 --> 03:46.392
Hey, you realize
what could happen if you stay?

03:46.392 --> 03:48.978
- What could happen, Rafe?
- What could happen?

03:48.978 --> 03:51.439
The police could find you here. Easy.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.399
And then, it's... it's done.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.734
You're gone forever.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.570
Or something much worse.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.657
Much worse.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.996
What have you done, son?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.751
It's not gonna be good if you stay.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.464
I'm asking you for a favor, okay?
You'd do anything in the world for Sarah.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.757
Anything.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.468
Now I'm asking, okay? Son to father.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.554
I'm not sure
you get to play that card anymore.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.559
I'm staying.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.197
Then whatever happens is on you.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.283
Yep, it's on me.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.786
Whatever you've done is on me, Rafe.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.676
<i>Pope, you've always known
your own mind. I appreciate that.</i>

05:02.719 --> 05:04.679
I know you're smarter than me,

05:05.179 --> 05:08.433
but... there is no way in hell

05:08.433 --> 05:11.352
we're letting you run off
to the jungles of South America

05:11.352 --> 05:13.187
with your hoodlum friends.

05:14.355 --> 05:15.356
Pop, please.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.818
I know Denmark Tanny
would want me to do this. Please!

05:18.818 --> 05:22.613
And you, Miss Cleo? You're free
to do whatever you want to do.

05:22.613 --> 05:26.159
But this one right here,
he is not on his own.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.369
I get it. You want to protect him.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.538
Keep him safe because you love him.

05:30.538 --> 05:31.914
Yes, I love him.

05:31.914 --> 05:35.251
Mr. Heyward, you've taught him
everything he needs to know.

05:35.251 --> 05:38.921
But what I've seen from your baby boy
is he's ready to fly the nest. He's right.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.674
This is about Denmark Tanny
and your family's legacy.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.969
I've gotta do this.
It's the real thing. Dad, Mom.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.095
This is it.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.097
Plus, I'm going.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.684
I'm gonna take care of him. Keep him safe.

Shit. Shit.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.224
JJ! Your ol' buddy, Mike.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.477
- You lost my load. Time to pay up!

06:34.477 --> 06:36.604
All right, we're gonna do this your way.

06:36.604 --> 06:37.563
Hmm?

06:38.064 --> 06:41.192
I'm coming in, JJ!
Yeah, I know you're in there.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.278
We're gonna do this your way.

06:48.324 --> 06:50.827
It's gonna be a lot easier
if you do it now.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.039
- JJ!

06:55.039 --> 06:58.000
Damn it. Where are you?

07:00.253 --> 07:01.254
JJ!

07:02.588 --> 07:03.673
I'm gonna find you!

07:07.218 --> 07:08.344
I want my money.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.809
- You're sure the pilot's gonna be there?
- Yes.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.728
Your dad's not playing some trick on us?
I mean, why would he help us?

07:18.229 --> 07:21.232
John B, the plane's gonna be there.
The pilot's gonna be there.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.860
He promised it's gonna take us
straight down to Orinoco.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.572
I believe him.

07:31.367 --> 07:33.411
I mean, I'm practically an adult.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.497
I'll never ask for anything again.

07:36.497 --> 07:38.458
No, I cannot promise that.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.878
I'm gonna write an essay
about my experiences

07:41.878 --> 07:44.505
with the Indigenous tribes
in South America,

07:44.505 --> 07:46.591
and then I will use that
to apply for college.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.385
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:49.385 --> 07:50.803
That dog's gonna hunt.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.808
Hey, Kiara.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.060
- Hey, come back.

07:58.060 --> 08:01.731
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just want to talk to you.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.109
- Uh, no, thanks.
-  Kiara, it'll just take a second.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.194
Stranger danger.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.160
Hey!

08:15.244 --> 08:16.245
Dad.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.039
Uh, Mom.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.082
- Who are you?
-  Look.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.168
This can go one of two ways.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.586
No, no, no.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.049
I'm sorry, honey.
We're sending you away for a while.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.885
- They say that Kitty Hawk's the best.
-  Wait, what?

08:30.885 --> 08:33.763
We just need to try this, okay?
We're just trying to help you.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.764
- No.
-  Stay calm.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.350
-  It's not forever. I love you.
- Mom. Mom.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.227
-  I'm sorry.
- I can't do this right now.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.229
- We're trying to help you.
-  Mom, Mom, Mom!

08:41.229 --> 08:42.230
You have to try.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.273
You can't send me
to wilderness cuckoo's nest!

08:44.273 --> 08:46.776
They're not gonna hurt you.
They're good. They'll help you out.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.320
Don't fight it. Just go, baby.
It's best for you right now.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.906
I said I don't wanna go. I don't want to!

08:51.906 --> 08:53.533
-  Kiara.
-  I don't want to!

08:53.533 --> 08:55.535
I have somewhere to be. No!

08:56.160 --> 08:56.994
No!

08:58.663 --> 09:01.207

09:02.792 --> 09:05.920
No. No. No. No.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.422
Mom!

09:08.422 --> 09:10.967
Dad! Please! No!

09:16.055 --> 09:17.974
-  Dude, where is everybody?
- I don't know.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.810
We should get in the Twinkie,
and we should just get 'em.

09:20.810 --> 09:24.564
- Just give 'em five minutes, all right?
- Guys, there's Pope and Cleo.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.443
- God!
-  Were you guys waiting for us?

09:29.443 --> 09:31.237
Yes, we were. You're late.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.532
Did you actually convince
your pops this time or...

09:34.532 --> 09:35.741
Cleo convinced him.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.119
My girl. That's what I'm talking about.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.288
- I thank you for being a part of my crew.
- Anytime.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.123
Hey, where's, uh... where's Kie?

09:42.957 --> 09:43.874
I don't know.

09:43.874 --> 09:46.335
It's gotta be her parents, dude.
They've been up her ass.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.087
They must've said
she couldn't come.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.714
We're gonna have to do this without her.

09:51.048 --> 09:51.966
No.

09:52.633 --> 09:53.759
Give me the keys.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.678
- No, dude. No, no, no, no, no.
- Gimme the keys.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.014
- It doesn't seem like a good idea now, JJ.
- Look.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.683
Her parents already hate me. All right?

10:00.683 --> 10:03.352
- Just give me an hour.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.521
It'll be like a black ops mission,
in and out.

10:05.521 --> 10:07.982
-  You gotta be...
- Surgical removal type shit.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.818
Plus... I kind of owe her.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.571
- Gimme the keys.
- Oh.

10:13.571 --> 10:15.698
Stop making that face and gimme the keys.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.869
Okay. Well, yeah,
you owe her, right? You owe her.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.455
I get it. I just appreciate the honesty.
Okay? Hurry back.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.749
- Hurry. Hurry.
-  Just give me an hour.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.626
No, no. Don't, don't. No.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.502
That door opens, bro.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.796
Feather, feather,
feather the throttle, you know?

10:30.796 --> 10:32.423
You got 59 minutes, JJ.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.151
Howdy, y'all.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.861
- Lovely afternoon.
-  JJ.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.864
Do not come on my property.
Not even a little bit.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.407
Yeah. Right. Um...

11:00.451 --> 11:01.661
- Well...

11:03.079 --> 11:04.205
Yeah, you know why I'm here.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.792
To see Kiara, and, uh...
well, we were supposed to hear from her,

11:07.792 --> 11:09.794
uh, but we haven't yet, so that's why--

11:09.794 --> 11:11.295
JJ, she's not here.

11:11.295 --> 11:15.216
Like I'm supposed to believe that?
All right, um, well, then where is she?

11:15.216 --> 11:18.511
Let's just say you're not gonna see her
for a while. All right?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.306
We sent her someplace
where she can try and rebuild

11:22.306 --> 11:24.141
what you and your friends destroyed.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.979
You sent her to that wilderness camp?

11:30.564 --> 11:32.066
- Yep.
-  God.

11:33.484 --> 11:34.568
You know,

11:35.903 --> 11:37.405
y'all really are some Kooks.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.658
- No! Just--
-  You gooned her.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.494
- You gooned your own daughter?
-  Hey! You gave us no choice.

11:43.494 --> 11:47.873
You gave us no choice, JJ! I don't wanna
see you around my family again!

12:52.438 --> 12:55.024
- Like I had a choice.

12:55.024 --> 12:59.361
Well, now the good news is,
we have a name for your condition.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.781
- Great.
- ODD.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.824
Oppositional defiant disorder.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.867
What is that?

13:04.867 --> 13:07.661
It's consistent opposition to authority.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.664
Did you just make that up?
Sounds like bullshit.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.292
As I was saying, consistent opposition.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.921
Now, fortunately,
it's very treatable with medication.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.631
I'm not taking medication.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.674
See that? That right there? Your reaction.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.052
You just confirmed my diagnosis.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.638
- Now, we can help with this.
- Your professional diagnosis.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.681
- You just have to work with us.
- Right.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.142
Um, do you mind if I use the restroom?

13:30.142 --> 13:31.477
It was a long drive.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.020
Of course. Right there.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.375
Open the door.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.628
- Come on! Open it!

13:59.088 --> 14:01.632
No! No, no, no, no. No. Get off me!

14:02.132 --> 14:04.468
Get off me!

14:04.468 --> 14:07.137
- You people are crazy!

14:11.559 --> 14:14.144
<i>At Kitty Hawk,
patients will not be allowed</i>

14:14.144 --> 14:17.565
<i>to contact the outside world
for the first six weeks of their stay.</i>

14:18.148 --> 14:20.943
<i>Patients will not be able
to use their phones.</i>

14:20.943 --> 14:23.904
<i>Patients will work
to be diligent and polite.</i>

14:23.904 --> 14:26.824
<i>Patients will be expected
to get to work on time.</i>

14:27.366 --> 14:30.536
<i>Be awake by 6:00 a.m.
and asleep by 9:00 p.m.</i>

14:31.745 --> 14:36.125
<i>Failure to adhere to the rules will result
in time in the reflection cabin.</i>

14:38.836 --> 14:41.547
<i>This is all
in the patient's best interest.</i>

14:57.104 --> 14:59.398
He left me. He left me with nothing.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.275
No other freaking option, you know.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.152
-  Hey.
- I'm gonna--

15:04.236 --> 15:05.154
Hey.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.280
You okay?

15:06.280 --> 15:07.865
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.409
All right.
Um, well, thanks for letting me crash.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.994
Yeah, yeah, of course.

15:17.374 --> 15:18.834
Actually, um,

15:19.752 --> 15:20.753
do you ever, uh...

15:22.796 --> 15:25.925
Do you ever feel like every move
is the wrong one or something?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.676
I don't know if that makes sense.

15:28.552 --> 15:29.470
All the time.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.639
- Really?
-  Yes.

15:31.639 --> 15:36.769
For example, I could've had a degree,
but, um, instead, I am a bartender,

15:36.769 --> 15:40.481
and that's all I'm ever gonna be,
so, yeah, trust me, I get it.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.524
Yeah, so...

15:45.527 --> 15:46.528
I'm just...

15:49.531 --> 15:53.577
I'm in a position right now
where, uh, if I do what's good for me...

15:55.579 --> 15:58.791
like, the smart thing,
then I gotta be really hard on...

16:00.125 --> 16:01.251
...someone else.

16:01.251 --> 16:04.505
You gotta look out for yourself, right?
No one else is going to.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.299
Yeah. No, I... I hear that. I'm just...

16:10.344 --> 16:14.515
Help... helping me
is gonna hurt someone that I care about.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.395
A lot.

16:19.395 --> 16:22.815
Well, um, the way I see it is,
when you've got

16:22.815 --> 16:25.401
a really, really, really tough choice
to make,

16:25.401 --> 16:28.404
the trick is to do the thing
that you'll regret the least.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.656
I learned that the hard way.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.993
You'll come to it.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.331
- You don't even know me.
- I know enough, Rafe.

16:39.331 --> 16:42.376
You're not like everyone else
from the club with their golf shoes

16:42.376 --> 16:43.919
and their shiny watches.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.587
Yeah, I don't care about any of that.

16:49.425 --> 16:50.509
You're different.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.678
I like that.

16:53.470 --> 16:56.181
You'll do the right thing.
I'm sure you will.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.457
It's all there.

17:22.249 --> 17:26.086
I got what you need.
Make it a clean job. Untraceable.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.590
And we ain't never gonna
see each other again.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.570
-  <i>Hey, cuz.</i>
-  Ricky.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.656
What was the name of that wilderness camp
that Uncle Larry sent you to?

17:54.656 --> 17:56.700
- Remember the one?
-  <i>It's kinda my day off.</i>

17:56.700 --> 17:59.828
I got a whole to-do list
to get ready for Cluckingham Palace.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.246
<i>Ricky, screw your chickens!</i>

18:01.246 --> 18:03.332
I need to know
what's the name of the wilderness camp

18:03.332 --> 18:06.043
that you got sent to
in ninth grade for being a perv?

18:06.043 --> 18:08.962
I wasn't being a perv, dude.
That shit was taken out of context.

18:08.962 --> 18:12.424
My bad, all right?
All I need to know is, what's the name?

18:13.008 --> 18:15.969
Kitty Hawk.
There's a girls' half and a boys' half.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.554
<i>It's like this reeducation camp</i>

18:17.554 --> 18:20.099
<i>run by the Moonies
outside the city near the coastal swamp.</i>

18:20.099 --> 18:21.100
Kitty Hawk Camp.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.936
Hey, why you asking? That's not
where they're sending you, is it?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.980
Funny. All right, that's all I need.
Thank you for the information, cuz.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.691
- I'll talk to you soon.
-  <i>You owe me for what I did with--</i>

18:30.275 --> 18:31.944
- JJ?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.324
- Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.243
- Yo. JJ?

18:39.243 --> 18:42.663
<i>Little change of plans. They did it.
They sent Kiara to the wilderness camp.</i>

18:42.663 --> 18:43.580
<i>Oh no.</i>

18:43.580 --> 18:46.458
So, uh, I'm gonna need
about eight hours for liberation.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.671
Eight hours? I don't have eight hours!
We've got a jet here. We're all waiting.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.631
I know, dog. I know the clock is ticking.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.717
Just hold out as long as you can.
If you gotta go, we'll meet you there.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.929
No, we can't... we can't...
No, JJ, listen, we can't wait for you.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.807
I know. I'm working on it, dude.
Luckily, I'm a problem solver.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.643
- Just stay in the Matrix, okay? I repeat--

19:09.523 --> 19:10.816
- JJ?
<i>-</i> <i>Damn!</i>

19:12.776 --> 19:15.821
- Son of a bitch.
- Yo, what's going on?

19:15.821 --> 19:17.197
What'd he say?

19:17.197 --> 19:18.657
I'm gonna kill him.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.075
You gotta be kidding me!

19:20.576 --> 19:21.743
Piece of shit.

19:22.870 --> 19:23.745
God!

19:52.733 --> 19:53.984
Okay, fine.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.039
Really?

20:12.127 --> 20:16.215
After everything you just put me through,
and you shoot out my... my friend's tire!

20:16.215 --> 20:17.674
That's not even my van!

20:18.175 --> 20:20.302
You lost the load, JJ.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.095
Now instead of me getting paid,

20:22.095 --> 20:23.430
I owe them.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.225
- Which I guess means you owe me, right?
-  I know, Barr--

20:26.225 --> 20:27.267
Get in the car!

20:29.978 --> 20:31.605
As much as I would like to,

20:32.898 --> 20:34.900
I kinda got a date, so...

20:34.900 --> 20:37.194
You heard him. Get in the car.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.116
Okay.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.869
If that's how it's gonna be.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.206
Look, I know you've heard the stories.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.583
About me and my friends,

20:51.583 --> 20:53.961
a little something
called the Royal Merchant.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.089
A pile of gold. Is that ringing any bells?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.548
I heard some bullshit.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.634
-  Well, that bullshit's real.
- Yeah?

21:00.634 --> 21:02.719
And yeah, we found it.

21:02.719 --> 21:06.390
Yeah, I saw. That's why you got
a bunch of dudes throwing your furniture

21:06.390 --> 21:09.268
in a dumpster out back your house?
You're living high off the hog, bro.

21:09.268 --> 21:13.355
Yeah, you're talking about the house
that's being foreclosed? The cover?

21:14.982 --> 21:16.233
The one to throw off the scent?

21:16.984 --> 21:20.195
Rule number one, don't do flashy shit,
like pay off a mortgage

21:20.195 --> 21:21.446
when you're cashing in.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.448
Stop. Let me guess.

21:23.448 --> 21:27.661
You, uh... you got that gold.
It's buried somewhere in a barn, right?

21:27.661 --> 21:30.038
And if I just let you go right now,

21:30.038 --> 21:33.083
you'll run right there,
you'll get it, we'll split it, right?

21:35.210 --> 21:37.838
Not exactly.
Actually, it's a little sweeter than that.

21:40.632 --> 21:41.717
May I?

21:42.217 --> 21:44.678
Look, let's just forget
about the Merchant gold.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.847
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

21:46.847 --> 21:49.641
We're going after the main course
right now. All right?

21:51.435 --> 21:53.228
We're going after the mother lode.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.439
And that's the truth

21:55.439 --> 21:57.983
of why we need
to get down to South America.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.526
Okay?

22:00.027 --> 22:02.237
Mike, come on, man,
I'm trying to help you.

22:02.237 --> 22:05.449
By giving you the opportunity
to make ten times more.

22:06.325 --> 22:09.077
No skin off your nose.
Just a lottery ticket.

22:14.166 --> 22:18.086
So, in this hand, you can get the pleasure
of beating my ass right here, right now.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.589
I honestly get that temptation.
I really do.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.633
All right? But in this hand,
in this hand, Mike,

22:24.634 --> 22:26.261
you got a pile of gold

22:26.928 --> 22:28.764
sitting and waiting for you,

22:28.764 --> 22:30.474
and all you need to have

22:30.474 --> 22:33.977
is just a little bit of patience, okay?

22:36.021 --> 22:37.814
And a flight to South America.

22:41.360 --> 22:45.781
Did you hear about John B?
His house burnt down last night.

22:46.448 --> 22:47.407
Wow.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.203
That... that's rough. I can't imagine.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.747
Yeah. Well, karma.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.208
Yeah. Yeah. It is, isn't it?

22:56.208 --> 23:00.962
Yeah. And it looks like Rose is back.
I saw the Cameron plane on the airstrip.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.549
You know, I really need to get her
something nice to welcome her back.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.426
She has had such a tough time.

23:19.272 --> 23:21.983
- What's good, big killer?
-  I'm calling it off.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.902
I'm calling it off. It's over.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.488
I don't want to do that thing anymore.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.031
- Um...
-  Hey.

23:28.782 --> 23:31.701
- You didn't do it, right?
- Do what, Rafe?

23:31.701 --> 23:35.330
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't do illegal things.

23:51.888 --> 23:53.098
What does that mean?

23:53.807 --> 23:55.684
Layers of protection, Rafe.

23:56.393 --> 24:00.981
- Safety lies in the layers of protection.
- I don't want it done anymore.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.400
Okay? I'm done.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.612
That sounds like a problem, but it's
out of my hands now, Country Club.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.823
Wait, out of your... out of your hands? Hey.

24:11.408 --> 24:14.327
Hey, explain, what does that mean?
What does that mean, "Out of your hands."

24:14.327 --> 24:16.121
I'm not the roofer, Rafe.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.081
I'm just a contractor.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.294
I wanted you to do it, Barry.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.880
- I wanted you to do it.
- You didn't say nothing about me doing it.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.882
- We talked about it.
- You just gave me money.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.009
- That's all you did.
- Is it done already, man?

24:29.551 --> 24:32.012
Hey, I need to know, is it done already?
Barry, is it done?

24:32.012 --> 24:33.180
No!

24:34.598 --> 24:36.725
You're wasting
your damn time with me right now.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.144
- All right.
- I told you I'm not the one doing it.

24:58.079 --> 24:58.997
Oh God.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.583
- Oh God.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.551
Hey, Sarah.

25:12.594 --> 25:15.805
What are you doing?
You just seeing John B off or what?

25:19.184 --> 25:22.771
I'm sorry I, uh... I didn't call.

25:23.730 --> 25:27.150
- I meant to call you last night.
- Oh, you meant to call me last night?

25:27.150 --> 25:28.568
Okay. No, it's all good.

25:29.277 --> 25:32.906
I was actually asking around myself
and heard your dad's plane was here.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.408
And I was like,
"Oh, that's... that's interesting."

25:38.662 --> 25:39.496
Yeah.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.165
So are you leaving with him?

25:49.756 --> 25:51.758
Are you leaving with him?
Yes or no, Sarah.

26:00.475 --> 26:04.354
You're just... you're just a f...
a damn liar, Sarah Cameron.

26:04.854 --> 26:08.441
You've always been a liar.
After everything we've been through?

26:08.441 --> 26:10.819
This... this is what you're gonna do to me?

26:10.819 --> 26:11.820
I'm done. Okay?

26:11.820 --> 26:16.032
You literally just promised John B
would go away, you'd stay here with me.

26:16.032 --> 26:18.159
I can't keep doing this
to myself anymore, man.

26:18.159 --> 26:20.996
Hey, Top. You got
a little something right here, man.

26:20.996 --> 26:23.456
Why don't you shut up? How about that?

26:23.456 --> 26:24.916
And oh, buddy, John B,

26:24.916 --> 26:27.877
you better be glad I didn't swing back
at you at the Wreck

26:27.877 --> 26:29.754
'cause I think you know
what would've happened.

26:29.754 --> 26:31.339
I'm not taking the bait, Top.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.467
You're right.

26:35.635 --> 26:37.262
You would've kicked my ass.

26:42.809 --> 26:46.438
I, um, heard
they're remodeling the Chateau.

26:47.230 --> 26:49.190
That's tough, man. How'd that happen?

26:51.067 --> 26:53.778
What did you just say?
No, Topper, what'd you just say?

26:54.904 --> 26:57.157
Hey, you guys have a nice life, all right?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.374
That's what you call a Kook?

27:06.374 --> 27:09.044
- Oh yeah. Big-time.

27:10.920 --> 27:14.341
Hi. Uh, yeah, the, uh...
the district attorney's office, please.

27:15.091 --> 27:17.886
Right, yeah. Yes, it's...
it's, uh... it's Topper Thornton.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.639
Right, Judge Thornton's grandson.

27:20.639 --> 27:25.560
Hey, listen, I would, um...
I'd like to formally file charges, okay?

27:29.189 --> 27:30.523
Ah, shit.

27:31.524 --> 27:32.942
Hold it right there, please.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.613
-  How are y'all doing?
-  Can I help you?

27:36.613 --> 27:38.365
Hey there, uh, sir. I...

27:39.074 --> 27:41.576
Camp counselor Laura,
I'm her... I'm her brother.

27:41.576 --> 27:44.871
I was gonna drop off one of these packages
back here for her, if that's okay.

27:44.871 --> 27:47.207
It's real quick.
I promise, just in and out.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.169
- That all right?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

27:51.169 --> 27:54.214
Thank you so much. All right.
Y'all have a good day.

28:15.276 --> 28:18.446
Hi there, sir, uh, I'm looking for...
I'm looking for the office.

28:18.446 --> 28:21.157
-  Yeah?
- Uh, is there a main lodge or something?

28:21.157 --> 28:23.827
Like a main lodge? Right down there?

28:23.827 --> 28:25.870
- Appreciate it.
-  Right down there.

28:29.249 --> 28:31.459
- How's it going, ma'am? Um...
-  Uh...

28:31.459 --> 28:32.877
Can I help you, son?

28:34.546 --> 28:37.507
I have a message
for one of your campers here. Um...

28:37.507 --> 28:40.927
Uh, her name is Kiara, uh, Carrera.
She's here, right?

28:40.927 --> 28:43.555
Unfortunately,
we're not allowed to do that.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.682
You're not even supposed
to be here on campus.

28:45.682 --> 28:48.935
Okay. It's... it's just
that it's a very important... May I sit?

28:48.935 --> 28:51.104
- Uh...
- A very important matter, ma'am.

28:51.104 --> 28:54.065
Oh, I'm sure it is, sweetie,
but we have a policy.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.402
No contact from the outside world
for the first six weeks.

28:57.986 --> 28:58.903
Right.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.447
Ma'am.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.575
It's actually a family matter, and, uh...

29:03.575 --> 29:06.035
I'm... I'm related to her. I'm her cousin.

29:07.203 --> 29:09.622
So, look, I know you got a policy and all,

29:09.622 --> 29:12.167
but there's just been something
that happened recently that...

29:12.167 --> 29:14.127
You know what?
I'm getting a little emotional.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.795
So I think I should go. I'm sorry.

29:15.795 --> 29:18.631
I shouldn't even be here,
like you said, so I'll leave you alone.

29:18.631 --> 29:21.509
But before I leave,
could you just let her know, um...

29:23.678 --> 29:26.765
just that, uh...
...Marley didn't make it?

29:28.475 --> 29:31.144
- Who's Marley?
- Marley's her best friend.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.814
A Siamese mix,
and, um, yeah, it was really sudden.

29:34.814 --> 29:39.903
And, you know, uh... the mailman
was coming at 40 miles per hour so...

29:39.903 --> 29:41.946
- He's in a better place now.

29:41.946 --> 29:45.825
But, um, could you just let her know
for me? I'd really appreciate that.

29:45.825 --> 29:49.078
- Thank you, ma'am. You have a great one.

30:21.903 --> 30:22.779
What happened?

30:22.779 --> 30:25.448
Well, your cousin was here a minute ago.

30:26.908 --> 30:28.159
Wait, what cousin?

30:28.159 --> 30:29.994
A young man, blond.

30:30.870 --> 30:34.666
He asked me to tell you that Marley,
well, he passed away.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.878

Are you okay?
You want me to call the police?

32:45.254 --> 32:48.132
No, no, no, we're good.
We don't need the police. We're good.

32:48.132 --> 32:49.717
Are you sure you're...

32:50.218 --> 32:51.928
- Ward?

32:51.928 --> 32:53.179
Is that you?

32:53.179 --> 32:54.722
Ward Cameron?

32:54.722 --> 32:57.392
- Holy shit, Ward!
-  No. Hey, we're good!

32:57.392 --> 33:00.144
Go, get out of here! Go!

33:05.942 --> 33:06.901
Let's go.

33:10.905 --> 33:12.699
-  Hey. Come on.

33:14.534 --> 33:17.203
I need a helmet. I can't be seen.
I gotta have a helmet.

33:17.203 --> 33:18.705
I think we gotta go.

33:18.705 --> 33:19.956
- Right?
-  Yeah.

33:39.267 --> 33:43.312
We know you're grieving and feel
you're best supported by your peers.

33:43.312 --> 33:45.481
So we're going to relocate you.

33:47.817 --> 33:51.904
I really feel like I need
some more time to reflect.

33:51.904 --> 33:54.991
No stalling. Come on.
We're putting you in a dorm.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.118
Cabin six. Let's go.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.625
Hey, uh, just hang on one sec.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.244
Girls, this is Kiara.

34:40.828 --> 34:43.206
She's had some tough family news.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.958
Let's show her
some empathy and love, okay?

34:47.001 --> 34:48.002
Can we do that?

34:51.172 --> 34:52.131
No? Okay.

34:59.680 --> 35:00.598
On top.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.742
-  <i>One-nine. Do you copy?</i>
- Victor one-nine.

35:19.742 --> 35:21.661
<i>We got a call
from the DA's office.</i>

35:21.661 --> 35:24.997
<i>Topper Thornton has officially pressed
charges against John B Routledge.</i>

35:24.997 --> 35:28.042
<i>- Thought you'd want to know.</i>
- Wondered when that was going down.

35:28.042 --> 35:31.254
<i>The Thornton kid says
that John B is out at the private airstrip</i>

35:31.254 --> 35:32.255
<i>on Bohicket,</i>

35:32.255 --> 35:34.799
<i>getting ready to take off
on the Camerons' private jet.</i>

35:34.799 --> 35:38.261
John B Routledge?
On the Camerons' jet?

35:38.261 --> 35:40.805
<i>That's what he said.
And something else.</i>

35:40.805 --> 35:42.515
<i>Locky Machart called.</i>

35:42.515 --> 35:44.976
<i>He says there was a dispute
out on the Skinners Landing,</i>

35:44.976 --> 35:48.020
<i>and get this, he says he saw Ward Cameron.</i>

35:52.692 --> 35:55.695
Locky's telling you
he saw Ward Cameron at Skinners?

35:55.695 --> 35:59.115
<i>He said that this guy
who he thinks was Ward was injured</i>

35:59.115 --> 36:01.993
<i>and he was heading out
in the direction of the airstrip.</i>

36:06.789 --> 36:11.711
Send a unit out to Skinners.
Put me on "en route" to the airstrip.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.671
And get me some backup, will you?

36:13.671 --> 36:15.214
<i>You got it, Shoupe.</i>

36:19.218 --> 36:20.928
- Has he called?
- Have you heard from him?

36:20.928 --> 36:23.890
- No. Nothing.
- We have to go. We don't have eight hours.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.641
Topper might've already called the police.

36:25.641 --> 36:27.185
Okay. Okay, I'll call him.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.187
Okay.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.522
Wait. That might be JJ right there.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.615
Hey. You're okay, Dad.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.034
You're okay, Dad. Come on. You're good.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.246
Hey. Hey, Dad.
Hey, come on. You're okay.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.456
You're okay.

36:48.456 --> 36:49.999
Come on, help! Help!

36:49.999 --> 36:52.543
Hey.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.339
Don't just stand there.
I need some help, please, come on.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.174
-  You got it. Keep coming.

36:58.174 --> 37:00.885
-  Come on. Come on, you got it.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.262
Please! Please! Come on.

37:04.347 --> 37:06.098
- What happened?
-  Let's go on the plane.

37:06.098 --> 37:07.683
-  Come on.
-  You're good.

37:10.478 --> 37:13.189
A fisherman spotted him, all right?
They know he's alive.

37:13.689 --> 37:15.691
We gotta get him off the island right now.

37:16.275 --> 37:17.693
- I got you. I got you.

37:18.277 --> 37:19.612
I got you, come on.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.161
Shit, this cannot be happening.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.623
- No. Hell, no.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.876
We can't. We're not getting
on a plane with him. No way!

37:34.794 --> 37:35.878
Hell, no!

37:38.923 --> 37:40.049
Are we still going?

37:44.220 --> 37:46.222
"Don't worry, he's not coming"?

37:46.222 --> 37:48.808
He wasn't supposed to.

37:48.808 --> 37:49.767
I told you.

37:56.857 --> 37:59.485
He stays on this island, he gets arrested.

37:59.485 --> 38:02.655
I don't think you understand. I don't know
if I can get on a plane with that guy.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.574
This is his plane.
I can't stop him from leaving.

38:05.574 --> 38:07.493
But he will still give us
a ride to Orinoco,

38:07.493 --> 38:09.578
so if you don't wanna get
on the plane, I get it.

38:09.578 --> 38:12.290
We'll find another way.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.875
There's no other way.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.049
Let's go.

38:26.053 --> 38:27.680
If you're going, I'm going.

38:28.347 --> 38:29.724
It's you and me.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.893
Let's get on the plane.
Come on, we're getting on the plane.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.562
- We gotta go.
- With them?

38:34.562 --> 38:38.190
- Yes. We don't have any other choice.
- Just stick to the plan. Come on.

38:38.691 --> 38:41.319
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

38:53.247 --> 38:54.248
We're not done.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.921
Hey. Don't let the devil tempt you.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.842
- Go.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.563
Please take care of him.

39:30.242 --> 39:34.538
You do anything to him,
anything, I swear to God I'll find you.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.306
Wait, Rafe.

39:52.306 --> 39:53.599
Rafe!

39:53.599 --> 39:55.935
Dad, hey! Get back on the plane.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.479
- They're coming now.
- I gotta talk to you. Come here quick.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.940
- Dad, you gotta... you gotta go!
- Rafe, now!

40:01.524 --> 40:02.650
-  Shit.

40:05.986 --> 40:07.488
- Go on, go.
- Shh.

40:08.864 --> 40:10.074
Thank you.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.326
- Yeah, thank you.
- Don't thank me.

40:12.326 --> 40:14.578
- Yep, yep, you're a good boy.
- I'm not.

40:14.578 --> 40:15.746
Yes, you are. Look.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.916
Doesn't matter what happens in the middle.
It's how you come out in the end.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.626
Look at me! Look at me!

40:21.752 --> 40:23.629
I know what you did, okay?

40:23.629 --> 40:26.841
I don't care,
'cause you came back for me, right?

40:26.841 --> 40:30.886
You're in control now. You're the man.
All of it is yours, everything here.

40:31.470 --> 40:34.849
It's yours, son. You're the man now.
You proved yourself, okay?

40:34.849 --> 40:37.143
- You're the man.

40:38.727 --> 40:39.979
I love you, buddy.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.773
Oh God. All right, come on!

40:43.357 --> 40:44.650
- I got it.
-  You good?

40:46.277 --> 40:47.653
Goodbye, son.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.867
Well... shit, Rafe.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.162
You look like you got a story to tell.

41:54.845 --> 41:57.640
-  Oh God.

42:21.163 --> 42:22.081
Kiara?

42:23.749 --> 42:24.875
Where are you, Kie?

42:25.376 --> 42:27.127
You were just here.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.855
Wait, no.

42:48.524 --> 42:50.067
Okay.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.210
Kie.

43:09.837 --> 43:10.838
Kie.

43:12.756 --> 43:13.841
Kiara?

43:16.385 --> 43:17.636
Kiara?

43:20.848 --> 43:24.935
- What are you doing in here?
- Hi there. Uh, evening, miss. Uh...

43:25.603 --> 43:28.606
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry to bother y'all. Okay.

43:28.606 --> 43:32.067
Hello, everyone. Uh... Shit.
I know this looks bad. I come in peace.

43:32.067 --> 43:35.529
But I'm just looking for someone.
I'm looking... looking for...

43:35.529 --> 43:36.905
Me.

43:36.905 --> 43:39.199
Kie.

43:57.718 --> 43:59.887
- How did... How?
- I know. Okay, yeah.

43:59.887 --> 44:02.181
It's a long story.
No time to explain though.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.974
Wait, there's one thing though.

44:04.558 --> 44:08.145
You know how you asked me
what I was going to say last night,

44:08.145 --> 44:11.106
and, um, Kie, I just...

44:13.150 --> 44:14.777
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

44:16.695 --> 44:17.821
I'm sorry, Kie.

44:22.826 --> 44:23.786
I love you.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.498
I love you too.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.380
Why did you park so far?

45:16.380 --> 45:18.799
Kind of a long story,

45:18.799 --> 45:21.885
but, um, because there's
only one road into Kitty Hawk.

45:21.885 --> 45:24.847
And with the camp and your mom
knowing what the Twinkie looks like,

45:25.472 --> 45:27.224
I thought it'd be best
to leave it as a decoy.

45:27.891 --> 45:30.686
There should be-- That's a cop.
Go. Cop! Cop! Cop! Cop!

45:31.395 --> 45:32.855
-  Go.

45:37.109 --> 45:39.737
- That's what the decoy's for.
-  Okay.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.530
- So are we hitchhiking?
- Not quite.

45:41.530 --> 45:43.699
We missed Ward's plane,
but I got another plan.

45:43.699 --> 45:47.369
Come on, man.
Where you at, dude?

45:51.707 --> 45:53.542
Here he comes. Dude, come on!

45:56.295 --> 45:58.797
- Hurry up, man, come on!
- Who the hell is that?

45:59.298 --> 46:02.259
- Kiara, I want you to meet someone.
- Is that Barracuda Mike?

46:02.885 --> 46:05.095
- Yep.
- Bus is waiting. All aboard.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.930
Mike, Kiara. Kiara, Barracuda Mike.

46:06.930 --> 46:09.141
-  Hop on in there.
- Let me get the seat.

46:09.141 --> 46:10.768
-  Nice to meet you.
-  That bar's for safety.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.227
- Plane's ready, right?
- Plane is ready.

46:12.227 --> 46:13.729
It's been ready, dude. Let's go.

46:13.729 --> 46:17.274
That's what I'm talking about.
I did it good! I'm a hustler, baby!

46:20.736 --> 46:23.530
Direct flight to South America
on Barracuda Airlines.

46:23.530 --> 46:24.907
What more could you ask for?

46:25.991 --> 46:26.950
Are you sure?

46:29.787 --> 46:31.497
You got somewhere else to be?

46:34.750 --> 46:36.001
Not anymore!

46:36.001 --> 46:37.169
Me neither!

46:39.087 --> 46:40.339
Next stop,

46:40.923 --> 46:41.965
El Dorado.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.218
Let's go.

46:44.718 --> 46:48.388
Come on, let's get
the hell out of here. Go, go, go!

46:48.388 --> 46:49.556
Going down.

46:53.143 --> 46:54.686
- Let's go!

46:56.104 --> 46:57.022
Let's go!

47:17.835 --> 47:18.836
That's good.

47:19.670 --> 47:20.838
Thank you, baby.

47:21.338 --> 47:22.214
God bless you.

47:24.967 --> 47:25.968
Thank you.

47:32.432 --> 47:34.643
John.

47:35.519 --> 47:36.520
Thank you too.

47:37.896 --> 47:42.401
I know you won't believe it, but...
you have nothing to worry about from me.

47:43.610 --> 47:46.405
Not anymore. I'm just here to help you.

47:47.364 --> 47:48.198
All of you.

47:49.908 --> 47:53.203
I have a lot to make up for.

47:53.954 --> 47:55.163
For what it's worth...

47:58.292 --> 48:00.002
I'm glad your father's alive.

48:25.736 --> 48:28.280
 <i>Look at how far we've come, John.</i>

48:28.280 --> 48:30.115
A day's ride upriver,

48:30.616 --> 48:33.744
and then all that's left is
a single track through the jungle.

48:35.579 --> 48:38.373
You know, John,
all the men who have held this idol

48:39.124 --> 48:40.334
have come to grief.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.295
Every single one.

48:44.671 --> 48:46.548
Many say it's cursed, you know.

48:49.551 --> 48:52.262
Well, at this point,
it'd be hard to argue with them.

48:52.262 --> 48:55.182
You see,
John, I don't see it as a curse.

48:55.891 --> 48:56.892
It's a test

48:57.392 --> 48:59.269
to prove yourself worthy

48:59.269 --> 49:01.396
of being the true heir to the gold.

49:01.396 --> 49:04.775
That, John,
is what the idol is looking for.

49:06.026 --> 49:06.985
The true heir.

49:07.486 --> 49:10.197
The man
who can pull the sword from the stone.

49:10.822 --> 49:13.241
The other ones,
you know, they weren't the ones.

49:14.326 --> 49:16.662
Yeah, but you've got no doubt, do you?

49:22.125 --> 49:23.168
No.

49:23.794 --> 49:26.797
Of course not.
Because I was born to do it, you know.

49:26.797 --> 49:28.298
That is my destiny.

49:29.883 --> 49:32.594
In fact, the only thing
that can stop me now

49:33.345 --> 49:34.346
is you.

49:35.138 --> 49:37.391
You have two days until the full moon.
