She's an Olympian so I mean,let's be honest, she's fine.

07:47.052 --> 07:48.122
I never had to learn to cook.

07:48.226 --> 07:50.124
I spent my life in the gym.

07:50.228 --> 07:51.505
Exactly, so here
now is your chance.

07:51.609 --> 07:53.921
I am just as nervous
for this competition--

07:54.025 --> 07:54.853
No.

07:54.957 --> 07:56.130
As I am the Olympics.

07:56.234 --> 07:57.753

07:57.856 --> 07:59.513
Yeah, you gotta like
really get in there.

07:59.617 --> 08:02.654
I would rather do back flipson a four inch balance beam

08:02.758 --> 08:04.380
than test out my cooking skills.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.381
I'm like shaking right now.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.347
No, don't be.

08:30.544 --> 08:31.407
I don't think they can do it.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.236

Ricky Williams.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.342

08:44.489 --> 08:46.905
That's a fucking quarter man.

08:47.009 --> 08:48.424
You can win achampionship in that time.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.253
I'm a huge NFL fan,
so it's an honor

08:50.357 --> 08:51.738
to cook next to one
of the most prolific

08:51.841 --> 08:53.291
linebackers in NFL history.

08:53.394 --> 08:54.948
This guy is a monster.

08:55.051 --> 08:58.123
So we need to chop up somebutter, so take the butter out.

08:58.227 --> 08:59.780
Shawn Merriman, he was
checking himself out.

08:59.884 --> 09:01.437
He was making sure he stilllooked good, you know.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.438
You're doing perfect.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.370
Yeah you're sweating.

09:03.473 --> 09:04.682
You're working a sweat.

09:04.785 --> 09:06.753
He is a good looking guy,so it's kind of distracting.

09:06.856 --> 09:08.168
- Shawn, we good?
- We're good.

09:08.271 --> 09:09.134
You're looking good.

09:09.238 --> 09:11.447
We've worked up
a sweat down here.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.174
I mean Nick was
checking them out.

09:14.277 --> 09:15.382
I don't know who
Benjamin's cooking

09:15.485 --> 09:18.972
with but damn, that ass though.

09:19.075 --> 09:20.283
Eight minutes, guys.

09:20.387 --> 09:21.630
Always say walking
through the kitchen.

09:22.665 --> 09:23.597
Hot, hot.

09:23.701 --> 09:25.150
Walking through the
kitchen, hot, hot.

09:25.254 --> 09:26.324
Hot, hot.

09:27.808 --> 09:29.292
It's getting hot in here!

09:29.396 --> 09:30.190
You're distracting me.

09:30.293 --> 09:31.122
Right here.

09:31.225 --> 09:32.675
Come on don't focus on them.

09:32.779 --> 09:33.745
That's what we're gonna do.

09:33.849 --> 09:34.712
Psyche them out.

09:34.815 --> 09:35.644
Fade!

09:35.747 --> 09:38.301
[chanting]

09:38.405 --> 09:40.303
I've only been in the kitchenwith Reggie for five minutes,

09:40.407 --> 09:41.615
and it feels like I've beenin the kitchen with him

09:41.719 --> 09:42.858
for 10 years.

09:42.961 --> 09:44.894
We're just vibing.

09:44.998 --> 09:46.931
That's called
making them blister.

09:47.034 --> 09:48.760
We're making
them blister, baby.

09:48.864 --> 09:49.761
Oh, my.

09:49.865 --> 09:51.383
We're making them
blister over here.

09:51.487 --> 09:52.799
Making our tomatoes
blister over here.

09:52.902 --> 09:54.007
I'm sorry.

09:54.110 --> 09:55.387
So a score is like you'rejust barely marking it.

09:55.491 --> 09:56.354
See they're so focused.

09:56.457 --> 09:57.597
I know.

09:57.700 --> 10:00.116
All those other athletes,you're all going down.

10:00.220 --> 10:01.635
This is the team right here.

10:01.739 --> 10:02.602
There's no comparison.

10:02.705 --> 10:04.189
You can't even touch us.

10:04.293 --> 10:06.675
High and y.

10:06.778 --> 10:07.917
High and why.

10:08.021 --> 10:09.091
Excellent.

10:09.194 --> 10:10.299
12 o'clock.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.645
One o'clock.

10:11.749 --> 10:12.957
Give each of them a tap, tap.

10:13.060 --> 10:17.617
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.826
Robin and Reggie, maybe
you should focus more

10:19.929 --> 10:22.829
on the searing of the scallopsas opposed to your dance moves,

10:22.932 --> 10:24.554
because we're focused
on our sea bass.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.108
We're focused on
everything right now.

10:26.211 --> 10:27.247
That's what we're doing.Focusing on the whole plate.

10:27.350 --> 10:28.317
We'll dance later when we win.

10:28.420 --> 10:29.249
Yes.

10:29.352 --> 10:30.664
So use the fish
spatula to kind

10:30.768 --> 10:32.183
of press it down, but lightly,don't press it down too hard.

10:32.286 --> 10:33.494
- So, like that?
- Yeah.

10:33.598 --> 10:35.427
We're going to dribble aroundthis kitchen right now.

10:37.222 --> 10:38.051
And hit threes.

10:39.362 --> 10:40.398
And half court shots.

10:40.501 --> 10:42.434
Whatever that means.

10:42.538 --> 10:44.160
See that one's
getting golden brown.

10:44.264 --> 10:45.886
So let's put that one first.

10:45.990 --> 10:47.025
Ooo, that's hot, hot, hot.

10:47.129 --> 10:47.923
Don't be scared.

10:48.026 --> 10:48.993
You're not going to get burnt.

10:49.096 --> 10:50.063
All right.

10:50.166 --> 10:51.167
- Oh we doing it over here.- Oh yeah?

10:51.271 --> 10:52.168
We doing it.

10:52.272 --> 10:53.549
We're not even
sweating over here.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.446
We're not even nervous.

10:54.550 --> 10:55.551
Flip it.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.898
Just like that.

10:58.002 --> 10:58.796
It is so hot.

10:58.899 --> 10:59.693
Oh he's sweating.

10:59.797 --> 11:01.384
Sweating over here, girl.

11:01.488 --> 11:02.972
GORDON RAMSAY: Just over
three minutes, guys.

11:03.076 --> 11:04.387
Now we're going to

11:04.491 --> 11:05.906
Look at that shit.

11:06.010 --> 11:07.287
Look at that.

12:11.247 --> 12:12.524
I'm going to taste

12:12.628 --> 12:15.355
and that all-star team will thentake a place in those chairs

12:15.458 --> 12:16.770

12:20.118 --> 12:21.292
will win this challenge.

12:21.395 --> 12:22.224
Right.

12:22.327 --> 12:23.812
First up, Nick and Jordan.

12:23.915 --> 12:24.709
Let's go.

12:24.813 --> 12:25.641
Wanna bring it?

12:25.745 --> 12:26.780
Good luck y'all.

12:26.884 --> 12:29.093
I'm super nervous to
go approach Chef Ramsay.

12:29.196 --> 12:30.853
I know he's a little
bit intimidating,

12:30.957 --> 12:33.718
and I don't know if he'sgoing to yell at me or not.

12:33.822 --> 12:34.754
Right.

12:34.857 --> 12:36.617
Jordyn, describe
your dish, please.

12:36.721 --> 12:39.448
So we have the--

12:39.551 --> 12:41.139
You got it.

12:41.243 --> 12:46.110
Celery root puree, and we havepeppercorn crusted scallops.

12:46.213 --> 12:50.217
The actual cook on the
scallops is delicious.

12:50.321 --> 12:51.598
Good job, Jordyn.

12:51.701 --> 12:53.117
I just wish we would
get cook on the scallop

12:53.220 --> 12:54.083
like that with the service.

12:54.187 --> 12:55.636
Do you cook often?

12:55.740 --> 12:56.983
- I do not, no.
- Really?

12:57.086 --> 12:58.743
I'm pretty good at scrambledeggs, but that's about it.

12:58.847 --> 13:00.469
You may want to consideranother career here.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.573
Great start.
Both of you.

13:01.677 --> 13:02.505
Well done.
- Thank you.

13:02.609 --> 13:05.336
Please take a seat.

13:05.439 --> 13:06.613
Good job, Jordyn.

13:06.716 --> 13:09.064
That was nerve-wracking.

13:09.167 --> 13:10.272
Next up, Robin and Reggie.

13:10.375 --> 13:11.169
Let's go.

Good luck y'all.

13:12.722 --> 13:13.689
We look good.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.106
We look good, we
cook well, and we're

13:17.210 --> 13:18.521
going to win this thing.

13:18.625 --> 13:19.902
Reggie, describe
the dish please.

13:20.006 --> 13:23.699
This is seared
scallops in a uni sauce.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.390
Pasta's cooked excellent.

13:25.494 --> 13:27.841
It's fresh, it's clean,
and it's vibrant.

13:27.945 --> 13:30.602
But for me, the hero of
this is the scallops.

13:30.706 --> 13:32.432
Each and every one of themhas been seared beautifully.

13:32.535 --> 13:33.951
You said it.
You said it.

13:34.054 --> 13:35.676
You said it.GORDON RAMSAY: Tough one.

13:35.780 --> 13:36.816
We had more scallops.

13:36.919 --> 13:38.887
They only had three
or four scallops, so.

13:38.990 --> 13:41.406
I mean I can do four
scallops in my sleep.

13:41.510 --> 13:43.995
I love the competitive
spirit, Reggie.

13:44.099 --> 13:45.859
Does it outshine
Nick and Jordan?

13:48.862 --> 13:49.690
Yes, it does outshine.

13:49.794 --> 13:50.588
Yeah!

13:50.691 --> 13:52.003
OK.

13:52.107 --> 13:54.109
Please, take a seat.

13:54.212 --> 13:55.351
Oh my goodness.

13:55.455 --> 13:59.114
Sorry Nick and Jordan,but this throne is now ours.

13:59.217 --> 14:00.253
Are you kidding me?

14:00.356 --> 14:03.428
We are now the
King of the hill.

14:03.532 --> 14:06.017
Bye bye.

14:06.121 --> 14:07.432
Nice job, boss.

14:07.536 --> 14:08.364
Right.

14:08.468 --> 14:10.332
Next up, Millie and Ricky.

14:10.435 --> 14:11.436
Let's go.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.266
We got sea bass three ways.

14:13.369 --> 14:14.405
Three delicious ways.

14:14.508 --> 14:16.441
I mean I'm telling you,
when you taste each one,

14:16.545 --> 14:17.649
taste buds explode.

14:17.753 --> 14:18.823
I don't see how we can lose.

14:18.927 --> 14:19.720
At all.

14:19.824 --> 14:21.032
So describe the dish please.

14:21.136 --> 14:22.758
We wanted to take sea bassand do it different ways.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.932
So here we have a fritter.

14:24.035 --> 14:26.589
We have the pan searedsea bass with the risotto.

14:26.693 --> 14:28.212
And over here, we
have poached sea bass

14:28.315 --> 14:29.592
on a fennel and apple salad.

14:32.837 --> 14:33.838
Right.

14:33.942 --> 14:35.426
Love the risotto
and the sea bass.

14:35.529 --> 14:36.530
Love the fritter.

14:36.634 --> 14:39.499
So does it beat
Robin and Reggie?

14:42.364 --> 14:43.503
Yes, it does.

14:43.606 --> 14:44.538

14:48.094 --> 14:49.405
Get up out of here
Robin and Reggie.

14:49.509 --> 14:50.855
Bye bye.

14:50.959 --> 14:52.892
And you can't put your leg outon this one, Reggie, no fouls.

14:57.966 --> 14:58.898
OK.

14:59.001 --> 15:01.245

15:04.800 --> 15:06.698
She just straight elbowed me.

15:06.802 --> 15:07.837
All right.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.806
We have pasta tossed in
uni sauce, seared sea

15:10.910 --> 15:13.636
bass, and miso beet puree.

15:13.740 --> 15:16.708
Great color on the
skin here, love that.

15:16.812 --> 15:18.503
Sea bass is cooked
to perfection.

15:18.607 --> 15:19.435
That's beautiful.

15:19.539 --> 15:22.369
But does it beat Millie's?

15:22.473 --> 15:23.267
It's a tough one.

15:26.201 --> 15:28.928
I'd like Michelle and Candaceto take a seat please.

15:29.031 --> 15:30.377
Yes!

15:38.351 --> 15:39.559

15:39.662 --> 15:40.732
I mean, I know
Shawn wants to win.

15:40.836 --> 15:41.630

15:47.291 --> 15:49.155
Shawn, what was it likecooking in Hell's Kitchen?

15:49.258 --> 15:50.156
It was a workout.

15:50.259 --> 15:51.295
I was in there sweating
the whole time,

15:51.398 --> 15:52.882
and I looked over I seen
Reggie and I said, OK,

15:52.986 --> 15:55.230
he's sweating more than me, soI'm not that bad out of shape.

15:55.333 --> 15:56.507
Describe the dish please.

15:56.610 --> 16:00.821
So we got a smoked lambloin and roasted cauliflower.

16:00.925 --> 16:01.719
Oh wow.

16:01.822 --> 16:02.823
The lamb is cooked beautifully.

16:02.927 --> 16:03.721
Let's get that right.

16:03.824 --> 16:06.517
The inside is pink.

16:06.620 --> 16:08.415
Sean's nickname, as you
know, is lights out.

16:08.519 --> 16:11.591
Is it going to be lights outfor Michelle and Candace?

16:11.694 --> 16:13.489
That's a really tough one.

16:13.593 --> 16:15.836
[tense music]

The dish--

30:32.658 --> 30:33.486
Take it over Nick, please.

30:33.590 --> 30:35.661
Yes, chef.

30:35.764 --> 30:36.869
Here's this New
York Strip for you.

30:36.973 --> 30:37.836
I'm sorry about that.

30:37.939 --> 30:38.975
I hope this is
better for you, OK.

30:39.078 --> 30:39.907
All right.
- Thank you so much.

30:40.010 --> 30:40.631
How was everything
else so far?

30:40.735 --> 30:41.632
Incredible.
- Good.

30:41.736 --> 30:43.427
Good to hear.

30:43.531 --> 30:46.051
Everybody enjoy your meal.

30:46.154 --> 30:47.328
An order.
Hey.

30:47.431 --> 30:48.501
One six top.

30:48.605 --> 30:50.883
It's two pork, two beef
wellington, two lamb.

30:50.987 --> 30:52.160
Yes, chef.

30:52.264 --> 30:53.610
Robin, that means you'refour minutes in the past.

30:53.713 --> 30:55.267
Hold on.
NICK: How long?

30:55.370 --> 30:56.199
One second.

30:56.302 --> 30:58.063
I need more pots and pans guys.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.065
You need to get-- you needto get that table going.

31:00.168 --> 31:01.998
Benjamin, are you slowingdown because of her?

31:02.101 --> 31:03.171
Yes or no.
- No.

31:03.275 --> 31:04.069
Yes, chef.

31:04.172 --> 31:05.173
Yes?

31:05.277 --> 31:06.968
Fucking hell.

31:07.072 --> 31:07.866
I'm sorry guys.

31:07.969 --> 31:08.763
I'm in the weeds right now.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.798
I apologize.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.352
Don't apologize,
just bounce back.

31:11.455 --> 31:12.387
Just bounce back.

31:12.491 --> 31:14.320
The fennel's
heating up right now.

31:14.424 --> 31:17.427
Robin, get up salmon
and garnish first.

31:17.530 --> 31:19.049
Would you stop
calling stuff at me.

31:19.153 --> 31:20.982
Let me focus real quick.

31:21.086 --> 31:21.880
Please.

31:21.983 --> 31:22.846
Take a breath.

31:22.950 --> 31:24.848
I am getting my
ass pounded tonight.

31:24.952 --> 31:29.508
Like pounded, pounded,
pounded, pounded.

31:29.611 --> 31:31.303
Robin, can you
walk garnish please.

31:31.406 --> 31:32.545
Hold on.
BENJAMIN: I'm ready now.

31:32.649 --> 31:33.512
We're ready to go.
ROBIN: OK.

31:33.615 --> 31:35.134
Behind you.

31:35.238 --> 31:36.066
Pork.

31:36.170 --> 31:37.309
Chef, this is--

31:37.412 --> 31:39.138
Just stop talking to megive me the fucking garnish.

31:39.242 --> 31:40.657
I don't like this.I want to put new ones down.

31:40.760 --> 31:43.522
Oh my God.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.317
I don't want to send that.

31:45.420 --> 31:46.697
Just come here.

31:46.801 --> 31:48.216
I told him I didn't
want to sent this.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.046
All of you, come here.

31:50.149 --> 31:51.737
ROBIN: Chef, I told you Ididn't want to send that.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.049
I'm sorry if you
misunderstood me.

31:53.152 --> 31:54.705
What did you just say to me?

31:57.191 --> 31:57.950
Where did they go?

32:02.058 --> 32:04.715
[dramatic music]

32:04.819 --> 32:06.027
I told you I didn't
want to send that.

32:06.131 --> 32:07.615
I'm sorry if you
misunderstood me.

32:07.718 --> 32:10.066
What did you just say to me?

32:10.169 --> 32:12.378
Robin, you do not want toget in Chef Ramsay's way.

32:12.482 --> 32:13.793
If you get in his
way, it's going

32:13.897 --> 32:17.521
to be like running at the bullsin Spain, and you gonna lose.

32:17.625 --> 32:18.695
I said I didn't
want to send that.

32:18.798 --> 32:19.938
What is this?

32:20.041 --> 32:22.216
MICHELLE: Overcooked
Brussels sprouts.

32:22.319 --> 32:25.529
Chef Ramsay is pissed,
because Robin's Brussels

32:25.633 --> 32:27.635
sprouts look like rabbit turds.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.396
Sorry chef, I must have
changed the wrong pan.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.328
Come on Robin.

32:31.432 --> 32:32.329
NICK: Bounce back Robin.

32:32.433 --> 32:33.468
Refire it, OK?

32:33.572 --> 32:35.263
I feel like I just
got a beat down,

32:35.367 --> 32:37.645
but you know what, I amnot going down like this.

32:37.748 --> 32:39.578
Robin you're good, come on.

32:40.579 --> 32:41.683
I got it.

32:41.787 --> 32:43.685
Behind, there you go chef.

32:43.789 --> 32:46.447
[dramatic music]

32:46.550 --> 32:47.758
Where's this go?

32:47.862 --> 32:48.828
You know where we're going, yes?

32:48.932 --> 32:49.726
It's really good.

32:49.829 --> 32:50.969
It's great.

32:51.072 --> 32:52.418
Fabulous.

32:52.522 --> 32:53.833
Last table. let's go.

32:53.937 --> 32:56.457
One pork, one New York strip,one halibut, one crispy salmon.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.596
Yes, chef.

32:57.699 --> 33:01.427
MICHELLE: I can get this
up in 4 minutes, OK.

33:01.531 --> 33:03.360
Let me know when I can run

33:03.464 --> 33:04.913
MICHELLE: Walk now,
go with garnish.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.881
Garnish coming to
the window chefs.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.434
Walking right now.

33:08.538 --> 33:10.091
Behind you.

33:10.195 --> 33:11.644
Service please.

33:11.748 --> 33:13.612
Oh my God.

33:13.715 --> 33:15.441
I'm full.

33:15.545 --> 33:16.546
Stoves off please, Nick.

33:16.649 --> 33:17.478
Well done.

33:17.581 --> 33:21.033
Man, I'mma sleep like a baby.

33:21.137 --> 33:23.587
Line up, let's go.

33:23.691 --> 33:24.588
Right.

33:24.692 --> 33:26.349
First of all, well done.

33:26.452 --> 33:28.765
You served the
entire dining room

33:28.868 --> 33:31.043
faster and with more
quality than we have

33:31.147 --> 33:32.907
with both kitchens all year.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.357
But there were bumps
and problems on station.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.289
Yes?

33:35.392 --> 33:36.669
Yes, chef.

33:36.773 --> 33:39.396
So Michelle, you're the onlyone with a flawless service.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.606
What I want you to do right nowis to have a one on one chat

33:42.710 --> 33:45.816
and decide on two nominees.

33:45.920 --> 33:46.748
Get out of here.

33:46.852 --> 33:47.749
Yes chef.

33:47.853 --> 33:49.820
I was not expecting that.

33:49.924 --> 33:51.132
Oh my God.

33:51.236 --> 33:53.100
It's a tough position forme, but I have to decide who

33:53.203 --> 33:54.791
would we be stronger without.

33:54.894 --> 33:56.862
Just get your spiels
ready I guess.

33:56.965 --> 33:58.174
I don't know what else to say.

33:58.277 --> 33:59.520
I'll go talk to
you, come on let's go.

33:59.623 --> 34:00.762
OK.

34:00.866 --> 34:03.524
So I'm just going to askeach of you two questions.

34:03.627 --> 34:05.077
Why do you deserve to
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

34:05.181 --> 34:07.769
So I didn't make
any mistakes tonight.

34:07.873 --> 34:09.668
I think it's really importantto be able to acknowledge

34:09.771 --> 34:11.152
your own weaknesses.

34:11.256 --> 34:12.429
Chef Ramsay had to push you.

34:12.533 --> 34:13.327
You know what I mean?

34:13.430 --> 34:14.811
And that's what I saw.

34:14.914 --> 34:16.502
Michelle, the only reasonyou'd want to put me up

34:16.606 --> 34:18.401
for elimination right
now is because you don't

34:18.504 --> 34:19.402
want to compete against me.

34:19.505 --> 34:20.886
It'd be purely a strategy thing.

34:20.989 --> 34:22.336
But you know I'm
hoping that you want

34:22.439 --> 34:23.785
to compete against the best.

34:23.889 --> 34:25.235
What's the next question.

34:25.339 --> 34:26.650
So what do you think
your weaknesses are?

34:26.754 --> 34:28.445
Well, I don't know.

34:28.549 --> 34:30.827
I'm one of the best cooks here.

34:30.930 --> 34:33.450
Benjamin is not
being completely honest

34:33.554 --> 34:34.693
with his weaknesses.

34:34.796 --> 34:35.590
OK.

34:35.694 --> 34:36.729
Thank you.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.524
I think he can be a
little bit cocky so he

34:38.628 --> 34:39.732
should have been more vocal.

34:39.836 --> 34:41.217
He should have beendriving from the beginning.

34:41.320 --> 34:44.151
And he should have stepped upto the plate, and he didn't.

34:44.254 --> 34:45.635
Millie, you want to go?

34:45.738 --> 34:46.739
You already know.

34:46.843 --> 34:49.259
Sorry Benjamin, sorry
Robin, sorry Nick.

34:49.363 --> 34:51.261
Nobody was perfecttonight on their station.

34:51.365 --> 34:52.711
It comes down to
the least mistakes.

34:52.814 --> 34:54.057
And I had the least.

34:54.161 --> 34:57.888
So it's only right that
I don't get picked.

34:57.992 --> 34:59.856
I really don't care what
nobody say about me.

34:59.959 --> 35:01.202
I really think I
deserve to be here.

35:01.306 --> 35:03.687
And you've been
seeing great finesse.

35:03.791 --> 35:05.206
So what do you think
your weaknesses are?

35:05.310 --> 35:08.175
I need to learn moretechnique in certain areas.

35:08.278 --> 35:10.246
You had like a burned
pan too, didn't you?

35:10.349 --> 35:11.661
That was my biggest
mistake tonight.

35:11.764 --> 35:15.768
Not changing my Carbonara froma dirty pan to a clean pan.

35:15.872 --> 35:17.149
Did you see his
station tonight?

35:18.150 --> 35:19.289
That's bad.

35:19.393 --> 35:21.049
Basically all he cookedtonight was fucking risotto

35:21.153 --> 35:22.050
and fucking Carbonara.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.638
I did all the cured salmon.

35:23.742 --> 35:25.261
I did the fucking
four tartares.

35:25.364 --> 35:27.711
We were doing his cold apps.

35:27.815 --> 35:30.611
[ambient music]

35:30.714 --> 35:31.784
You ready, girl?

35:31.888 --> 35:33.752
I am not the
weakest person here,

35:33.855 --> 35:36.306
and I don't want anotherfucking repeat of season 10

35:36.410 --> 35:38.860
when I get my black jacketfor one day then I go home.

35:38.964 --> 35:39.758
I don't want that.

35:39.861 --> 35:40.690
I'm asking around.

35:40.793 --> 35:41.898
What are your weaknesses?

35:42.001 --> 35:44.211
Sometimes when I getfrazzled I get in my head.

35:44.314 --> 35:45.764
Like when everyone was
screaming at me today,

35:45.867 --> 35:47.041
I need everyone to
shut the fuck up

35:47.145 --> 35:48.560
and I have to focus
on one person.

35:48.663 --> 35:49.699
Yeah.

35:49.802 --> 35:51.149
I don't even know
why Robin would have

35:51.252 --> 35:53.185
showed Chef Ramsay that pan.

35:53.289 --> 35:56.361
She's like I'm not theweakest one here and I'm like--

35:56.464 --> 35:58.259
You're trying to
convince yourself,

35:58.363 --> 35:59.467
you're not the tightest one.

35:59.571 --> 36:01.538
I feel like Millie isdefinitely weaker than me,

36:01.642 --> 36:02.781
and Benjamin, who
doesn't communicate.

36:02.884 --> 36:03.678
Yeah

36:03.782 --> 36:04.921
That's my spiel.

36:05.024 --> 36:06.578
All right.

36:06.681 --> 36:07.717
I don't know.

36:07.820 --> 36:09.443
Everyone is fighting
for their life for sure.

36:09.546 --> 36:12.722
There's three really goodchoices for me right now.

36:12.825 --> 36:13.688
What up.

36:13.792 --> 36:14.586
This is awkward.

36:14.689 --> 36:17.140
Yeah.

36:17.244 --> 36:20.557
What are your strengthsand what are your weaknesses?

36:20.661 --> 36:21.903
I know this is a
competition Michelle,

36:22.007 --> 36:23.836
but you better not fuckingput me up you little bitch,

36:23.940 --> 36:26.287
I'll be so pissed at you.

36:26.391 --> 36:27.185
I'm just kidding.

36:33.121 --> 36:35.434
[steady music]

36:40.370 --> 36:41.164
What a night.

36:41.268 --> 36:42.234
[tense music]

36:42.338 --> 36:43.235
Michelle.

36:43.339 --> 36:44.719
First nominee and why, please.

36:44.823 --> 36:46.859
So first nominee is Robin.

36:46.963 --> 36:49.483
I think Robin should have beenmore comfortable with herself

36:49.586 --> 36:51.001
today on the garnish station.

36:51.105 --> 36:53.349
She should have been
more familiar with it.

36:53.452 --> 36:56.628
Second nomination and why.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.293
[tense music]

37:06.396 --> 37:07.190
Michelle.

37:07.294 --> 37:08.191
First nominee.

37:08.295 --> 37:11.021
Chef, the first
nominee is Robin.

37:11.125 --> 37:14.197
Second nomination, and why.

37:14.301 --> 37:16.786
The second nomination
is Millie, chef.

37:16.889 --> 37:18.166
Millie had a lot
of help tonight.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.030
He should have been more
confident and familiar

37:20.134 --> 37:22.585
in his station.

37:22.688 --> 37:24.380
Robin, Millie,
step forward, please.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.662
Millie, why should you
stay in Hell's Kitchen.

37:30.765 --> 37:33.975
I've improved on finesseand breaking out of my mold.

37:34.079 --> 37:36.184
I'mma turn up every
time I'm on the station.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.600
I've turned up garnish.

37:37.703 --> 37:40.844
I turned up meat Asian night,I turned up hot apps two times.

37:40.948 --> 37:42.294
Tell me when I went
down on the station.

37:42.398 --> 37:44.986
Everyone holds you
up like a team, that's

37:45.090 --> 37:46.678
why you're not going down.- Shut up.

37:46.781 --> 37:48.058
You're a better chef than me?

37:48.162 --> 37:51.717
You went down on garnish, youwent down on meat last time.

37:51.821 --> 37:52.684
You're tripping.

37:52.787 --> 37:54.064
I'm tripping.

37:54.168 --> 37:55.652
The first time you were onthe station, you went down.

37:55.756 --> 37:57.378
Every time you were on astation with somebody else,

37:57.482 --> 38:00.208
you'll did good.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.590
Robin, why should you
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:02.694 --> 38:03.522
I have not given up.

38:03.626 --> 38:05.352
I have more to show you.

38:05.455 --> 38:07.181
No matter what, when Iwas crashing and burning,

38:07.285 --> 38:09.666
I was fighting throughout thewhole time, I didn't give up.

38:09.770 --> 38:10.909
And the biggest
thing in the kitchen

38:11.012 --> 38:12.462
is admitting when
you can ask for help.

38:12.566 --> 38:14.361
I said I was drowning,
I needed help.

38:14.464 --> 38:16.570
But Millie, you don't helpout when people ask help.

38:16.673 --> 38:17.778
You're a liar.

38:17.881 --> 38:19.124
I'm not a liar.

38:19.227 --> 38:20.884
Everybody never even saidthat about me ever in life.

38:20.988 --> 38:22.023
- Really?
- You're a liar.

38:22.127 --> 38:23.370
I'm a liar.

38:23.473 --> 38:24.474
I see how it is when you'resitting there eating lamb

38:24.578 --> 38:25.786
chops, getting
sparkling water, I'm

38:25.889 --> 38:26.959
sitting there busting shit out.

38:27.063 --> 38:28.271
Get out my face.

38:28.375 --> 38:29.928
Y'all judging me on somethingelse and it ain't got

38:30.031 --> 38:30.894
nothing to do with cooking.

38:30.998 --> 38:31.930
You tripping.

38:32.033 --> 38:33.380
Don't say nothing else to me.

38:33.483 --> 38:35.105
But this is why I don'tever want to speak to you,

38:35.209 --> 38:36.348
because you get so angry.

38:36.452 --> 38:37.315
Millie, calm down.

38:37.418 --> 38:38.212
You're a liar.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.178
Don't say nothing else to me.

38:39.282 --> 38:40.387
I ain't judging
you on nothing.

38:40.490 --> 38:41.595
Don't say nothing else to me.

38:41.698 --> 38:42.768
Enough, enough, enough.

38:42.872 --> 38:43.700
Both of you.

38:43.804 --> 38:45.184
Millie, Robin, stop it.

38:45.288 --> 38:48.222
They should hand you
your red jacket back.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.845
Enough, right there.

38:50.949 --> 38:53.261
My decision is

38:53.365 --> 38:56.126
[dramatic music]

39:00.821 --> 39:01.649
Yes, chef.

39:01.753 --> 39:04.307
Listen carefully.

39:04.411 --> 39:07.517
Get back in line.

39:07.621 --> 39:08.932
Robin.
Come here.

39:09.036 --> 39:09.830
Yes, chef.

39:13.109 --> 39:15.180
At the beginning of thiscompetition, you almost left.

39:15.283 --> 39:16.319
Yes, chef.

39:16.423 --> 39:18.977
And since that moment
you turned it around.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.979
You found your voice.

39:21.082 --> 39:23.430
But you're not ready tobe my head chef in Vegas.

39:23.533 --> 39:24.431
All right chef.

39:24.534 --> 39:25.846
I appreciate the
opportunity to come back

39:25.949 --> 39:26.916
here in Hell's Kitchen again.

39:27.019 --> 39:27.917
I don't want your jacket.

39:28.020 --> 39:28.883
Keep hold of it.

39:28.987 --> 39:29.781
Thank you chef.

39:29.884 --> 39:31.438
[soft music]

39:33.198 --> 39:34.337
- Thank you.
- Get out of here.

39:34.441 --> 39:35.821
- Robin.
- Robin.

39:35.925 --> 39:36.719
Come here.

39:36.822 --> 39:37.616
Bye guys.

39:40.688 --> 39:41.896

- Love you too.

39:42.000 --> 39:42.794
Keep your head up.

39:42.897 --> 39:45.106
Always

39:45.210 --> 39:47.799
I'll see you on
the street Millie.

39:47.902 --> 39:52.666
[ambient music]

39:52.769 --> 39:54.668
I did not think this is howit was going to end for me,

39:54.771 --> 39:55.910
but you know what?

39:56.014 --> 39:57.429
I have absolutely no regretsleaving Hell's Kitchen

39:57.533 --> 39:58.741
tonight I gave it my all.

39:59.845 --> 40:01.364
Who cooked the
lobster Wellington?

40:01.468 --> 40:02.261
Robin did, chef.

40:02.365 --> 40:03.297
Yeah, beautiful.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.229
Fuck yeah!

40:04.332 --> 40:05.955
I was rocky when I started.

40:06.058 --> 40:09.786
One out of five,
it was disgusting.

40:09.890 --> 40:10.787
Wake up!

40:10.891 --> 40:11.685
Yes, chef.

40:11.788 --> 40:13.100
Get out.

40:13.203 --> 40:14.998
But no matter what,
at least I know I

40:15.102 --> 40:16.379
put my heart on the plate.

40:16.483 --> 40:19.451
The winner of this challengewould be I think Robin.

40:19.555 --> 40:21.522
Robin three for
four, great job.

40:21.626 --> 40:23.938
At least I know I
went down fighting.

40:24.042 --> 40:25.319
Who does this belong to?

40:25.423 --> 40:26.493
Congratulations.

40:26.596 --> 40:28.046
Well done.

40:28.149 --> 40:31.429
Yes, Robin!

40:31.532 --> 40:33.603
I know I'm a
strong personality.

40:33.707 --> 40:35.881
Way to bounce back aftertwo shitty challenges.

40:35.985 --> 40:37.124
Thank you, that's
right, because I'm

40:37.227 --> 40:38.401
the bounce back queen.

40:38.505 --> 40:39.678
But in that kitchen?

40:39.782 --> 40:43.337
Strip, cod, so, lamb,
strip, cod, so, lamb.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.683
You should always have fun.

40:44.787 --> 40:45.546
GORDON RAMSAY: Fire.

40:47.928 --> 40:49.308
ROBIN: It's not the end of me.

40:49.412 --> 40:50.551
We're free!

40:50.655 --> 40:53.692
Me and my pet rock, Herbie.

40:53.796 --> 40:57.075
We're going to be just fine.

40:57.178 --> 41:00.354
One thing I do know forsure is I definitely have

41:00.458 --> 41:03.426
the right final four chefs.

41:03.530 --> 41:05.773
Now it's going to
get even harder.

41:05.877 --> 41:07.188
Get some rest.
- Yes, chef.

41:07.292 --> 41:08.086
Yes, chef.

41:08.189 --> 41:08.983
Thank you chef.

41:11.296 --> 41:12.262
MICHELLE: Oh my
gosh, it feels so

41:12.366 --> 41:13.919
good to be in the final four.

41:14.023 --> 41:16.094
Last girl standing!

41:16.197 --> 41:19.200
Focus is definitely the
key word moving forward.

41:19.304 --> 41:21.306
I just need to keep
my eye on that prize.

41:21.409 --> 41:23.411
I hope Millie brushes thatoff my shoulders because--

41:23.515 --> 41:24.896
That was too much man.

41:24.999 --> 41:26.242
I think it's super
unprofessional the way

41:26.345 --> 41:27.588
Millie is acting.

41:27.692 --> 41:30.488
You can't run a kitchen ora business acting like that.

41:30.591 --> 41:32.144
If tonight is any
indication of how

41:32.248 --> 41:33.974
the rest of thiscompetition is going to go.

41:34.077 --> 41:35.665
I definitely have
this in the bag.

41:35.769 --> 41:38.185
Robin, you'll see
me in the street?

41:38.288 --> 41:39.635
If you do something
to me in the street

41:39.738 --> 41:42.051
I'm calling the cops
on your crazy ass.

41:42.154 --> 41:43.431
That's what you
want to take it to?

41:43.535 --> 41:46.538
Oh I know why, because you can'tsee me in a fucking kitchen.

41:46.642 --> 41:47.539
Bye girl.

41:47.643 --> 41:48.782
GORDON RAMSAY
[VOICEOVER]: I've always

41:48.885 --> 41:50.887
admired Robin's no
nonsense attitude,

41:50.991 --> 41:53.096
but tonight she had
the wrong attitude

41:53.200 --> 41:54.650
and served up a lot of nonsense.

42:30.720 --> 42:31.514
What is this?

The egg is fucked.

42:32.653 --> 42:33.447

42:45.977 --> 42:46.771
