00:07.741 --> 00:13.114
Wow. This is so much
better than the carnival
Dad took us to last year.

00:13.147 --> 00:16.084
That wasn't a carnival.
He just sold us
popcorn in the back yard

00:16.117 --> 00:17.418
while they tented
our house for termites.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.788
Well, the snacks
are better here.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.557
They even have
deep fried milkshakes!

00:27.495 --> 00:29.430
Uh, how much was that?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.132
Because Mom
only gave us
100 dollars,

00:31.165 --> 00:33.134
and she's expecting
change back.

00:33.167 --> 00:36.337
No, she gave me
100 dollars
and put me in charge

00:36.370 --> 00:39.207
because I'm older
and more responsible.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.476
You're responsible?
Last week,
you lost your keys.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.511
While playing
on the roof.

00:44.845 --> 00:46.380
Of a fireworks factory.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.318
Hey, Chyna.

00:50.351 --> 00:53.187
Don't be sad, Olive.
I know it's summer,
but don't worry,

00:53.221 --> 00:55.389
school will start up again
in seven and a half weeks.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.690
That's not why I'm upset.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.228
My mom's making me
donate all my old dolls
to the toy drive.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.129
Oh, that's nice.

01:01.162 --> 01:05.099
No, it's not nice!
These are my babies!

01:08.302 --> 01:11.439
Wow. Your babies
are ugly.

01:11.472 --> 01:14.342
Don't you talk about
Eleanor Roosevelt
that way!

01:15.243 --> 01:16.510
It's all right, Ellie.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.412
She's just jealous
because she was never

01:18.446 --> 01:19.847
chairman of
the Presidential
Commission

01:19.880 --> 01:21.882
on the Status of Women.

You've had

I don't know
the Death Spiral.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.473
I wasn't even scared
for a second.

in the doll beauty pageant.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.651
A pageant for dolls?

03:37.685 --> 03:39.353
Well, maybe if one of
my dolls won,

03:39.387 --> 03:41.389
my mom would see
that they really
aren't worthless.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.756
Which obviously they aren't,

03:42.790 --> 03:44.558

from polyvinyl chloride,

trades at 7,200

03:48.662 --> 03:50.398

in her evening gown.

Well, into her doll girdle,
then her evening gown.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.120
Here you go,
little girl.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.255
If you want,
you can stand
a little closer.

13:42.289 --> 13:45.425
Nah, I'm good.
Now, let's do this thing!

13:46.126 --> 13:48.028
Orphan style!

13:48.061 --> 13:49.062
Uh-oh.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.033
(WHIMPERING)

13:54.201 --> 13:57.104
Oh, wow! You have
really good aim.

13:57.137 --> 14:01.041
But I bet this last penguin
will be very hard
to knock down!

14:03.176 --> 14:04.177
(GRUNTS)

14:06.146 --> 14:09.316
I win! I win! Doll me!

14:12.152 --> 14:13.887
Oh, uh...

14:13.921 --> 14:16.323
You don't want
these dolls because

14:18.091 --> 14:19.192
they're possessed.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.430
They're about to
be possessed...

14:23.463 --> 14:24.464
By me.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.469
Set 'em up again!
Come on,
while I'm still five!

14:33.673 --> 14:36.109
I'm sorry,
but we're closed.

14:36.143 --> 14:41.481
Nice try.
I can play this game
as long as I got the green.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.222
Oh!

14:52.960 --> 14:53.961
Ow!

14:57.497 --> 14:58.498
(GROANS)

15:01.268 --> 15:02.269
(SIGHS)

15:03.236 --> 15:04.237
Ow!

15:08.741 --> 15:12.145
Here you go.
Our last doll.

15:12.179 --> 15:13.947
How am I gonna
tell Olive?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.315
Just throw it on top.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.252
Today, old lady!

15:27.227 --> 15:31.198
Welcome to the final
portion of the pageant,
the talent event!

15:31.231 --> 15:35.135
And just a reminder,
I'll be signing photos
after the show.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.172
Huh! I did not age well.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.544
All right!
One of you dames go first.
I don't care which.

15:47.314 --> 15:52.119
For Little Lexi's talent,
I made a video of her
doing her favorite hobby.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.221
Martial arts.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.235
(GRUNTING)

16:17.177 --> 16:18.178
(NINJA SCREAMING)

16:19.579 --> 16:22.415
Thank you!

16:22.449 --> 16:25.452
And you should know that
Little Lexi dedicates
this performance

16:25.485 --> 16:29.089
to her fiance,
who's currently
serving overseas.

16:33.593 --> 16:38.165
I also served.
Two years in prison,
for assault and puppetry.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.435
Belinda's talent is...

16:42.469 --> 16:45.072
Let me guess.
Boxing?

16:45.105 --> 16:48.075
Putting things in boxes
is not a talent.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.582
Belinda and I will be
dancing the tango.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.223
(TANGO MUSIC PLAYING)

17:09.362 --> 17:11.098
(AIR HISSING)

17:13.366 --> 17:15.335
If you're looking
for somewhere
to dump that body,

17:15.367 --> 17:17.503
I might know
a few places.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.507
Don't worry,
I know mouth to valve!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.082
(GROANS)
Let's move this along.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.451
I gotta get
to a red carpet
in Hollywood.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.453
Yes, I'm dating
a piece of red carpet.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.521
Don't judge me!

17:37.390 --> 17:39.492
My doll's talent
is chemistry.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.328
Now, these are
volatile chemicals.

17:41.361 --> 17:44.297
So, when you handle them,
you should always wear
protective gear.

17:49.302 --> 17:52.505
We look forward
to seeing your reaction
to this reaction.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.541
(CHUCKLING)
It's chemistry humor.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.384
(EXPLOSION)

18:04.417 --> 18:05.418
(SHRIEKS)

18:10.657 --> 18:14.427
See? I told you
protective gear
was important.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.566
Wow, I haven't seen
a bomb like that

18:19.599 --> 18:22.202
since I went to see
Cookie Monster
on Broadway

18:22.235 --> 18:23.370
in The Color Purple.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.305
The guy's blue
for Pete's sake!

18:25.338 --> 18:26.306
It made no sense!

18:29.176 --> 18:30.577
Look what you did
to Little Lexi!

18:30.610 --> 18:32.412
She used to be
smoking hot.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.681
Now, she's just smoking.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.152
(CROWD BOOING)

18:39.186 --> 18:42.689
Okay, okay, yes.
I destroyed
the entire pageant,

18:42.722 --> 18:46.293
but the fact is,
it deserves
to be destroyed!

18:46.326 --> 18:48.928
Pageants like this
just celebrate
superficial things,

18:48.961 --> 18:50.330
like beauty
and clothing!

18:51.564 --> 18:53.333
This pageant is
disgusting

18:53.366 --> 18:55.702
and I am humiliated
to be a part of it!

18:55.735 --> 18:59.372
Well, since
all the other dolls
are out of commission,

18:59.406 --> 19:00.540
you win by default.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.210
I won! I won!

19:03.243 --> 19:05.612
It is the happiest
moment of my life.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.447
Thank you so much!

19:07.480 --> 19:10.583
I love you! I love you all!

19:10.617 --> 19:11.618
(SOBBING)

19:13.453 --> 19:16.423
We have to find
that orphan and
get those dolls back,

19:16.456 --> 19:18.191
or Olive will
never forgive me.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.626
(GRUNTS)

19:20.760 --> 19:22.495
I think she's nearby.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.633
There she is!

19:32.639 --> 19:33.640
Yes!

19:38.778 --> 19:42.449
Hey there, you...
Cute little ragamuffin.

19:44.251 --> 19:47.420
Listen, those dolls belong
to a friend of mine

19:47.454 --> 19:48.621
and I really need them.

19:48.655 --> 19:51.358
Boo-hoo!
Take a hike.

19:53.793 --> 19:56.963
Please? We'll give you
all your money back.

19:56.996 --> 20:00.367
Did you look closely
at that money?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.469
Is Little Orphan Annie
supposed to be
on the 20?

20:04.437 --> 20:06.373
You can't use fake money!

20:06.406 --> 20:08.408
At a fake game?
Sure I can!

20:10.277 --> 20:13.246
Please. I really
need those dolls.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.647
I don't think
you want them anymore.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.284
I melted them down.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.722
Did you know that
polyvinyl chloride

20:22.755 --> 20:26.359
trades at 7,200
Chinese yuan per ton?

20:28.461 --> 20:30.730
Hey, look! I think
this one's real.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.832
Oliver Twist was one of
our presidents, right?

20:37.470 --> 20:41.274
Olive! I have
really bad news.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.675
I know
this sounds crazy,

20:42.709 --> 20:47.814
but there's a wild pack
of criminal orphans
roaming the fairgrounds.

20:47.847 --> 20:51.784
And they took your dolls,
which I was holding
for safekeeping.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.320
YNo.?

20:55.555 --> 20:59.659
I'm sorry, Olive.
I know how much
those dolls meant to you.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.561
Eh. I don't care
about those rejects.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.563
Momma's got a winner!

21:08.801 --> 21:11.471
It's nice that the carnival
has healthy food choices.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.606
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Just hurry up and finish
your deep fried salad!

21:15.642 --> 21:17.844
Come on!
going to close.ter's

21:17.877 --> 21:20.380
We are not going
on that thing again!

21:20.413 --> 21:22.449
I promise!

21:22.482 --> 21:25.452
A wise man taught me
by slowing my breathing.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.586
What wise man?

21:26.619 --> 21:28.421
The guy who cleans
the porta-potties.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.057
He can hold his breath
for 25 minutes.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.425
This picture is
going to be perfect.
