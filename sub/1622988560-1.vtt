24:56.245 --> 24:58.080
Las Palmas 13.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.208
You get a statement from
the manager before he passed?

25:00.249 --> 25:03.419
No. "La Mayorista" ring a bell?

25:03.461 --> 25:05.254
Ah, Gladys Rodriguez.

25:05.296 --> 25:06.964
She controls the drug trade
on that block.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.342
Buys her dope
from Las Palmas, pays rent,

25:09.383 --> 25:11.093
protection to them, too.

25:11.135 --> 25:13.512
A woman. That's unusual.

25:13.554 --> 25:16.015
Yeah, she's an unusual woman.

25:16.057 --> 25:17.642
Looks like a banker.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.436
Kind of a female Stringer Bell.
Watch "The Wire"?

25:20.478 --> 25:21.854
[chuckles] Yeah, I binged it.

25:21.896 --> 25:23.314
Then you know
what I'm talking about.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.192
All business.
Not to be underestimated.

25:26.234 --> 25:28.778
- Who runs Las Palmas?
- Good question.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.780
Shot caller's a lifer,
Pelican Bay.

25:30.821 --> 25:32.823
Still calling the shots?

25:32.865 --> 25:35.534
Yes, but leaves
a power vacuum on the street.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.662
Couple youngbloods
vying for the crown.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.580
Emmanuel Trejo, Mickey Peña.

25:39.622 --> 25:41.207
I'll work up a file.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.626
They were sending a message
to the manager.

25:43.668 --> 25:45.419
Residents, too.

25:45.461 --> 25:46.963
Business has been slow lately.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.632
Beefed up police presence.
More arrests, more patrols.

25:49.674 --> 25:51.467
Less profits.

25:51.509 --> 25:53.678
La Mayorista can't
be happy about that.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.514
I hear more than unhappy.
Fit to be tied.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.766
You'll get us
what you got on her, yeah?

25:58.808 --> 26:01.143
Will do. How's your burrito?

26:02.228 --> 26:03.854
- Delicious.
- Good, right?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.690
This is one of my favorites.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.692
You know, all these taco trucks
and lunch wagons

26:07.733 --> 26:10.361
- pay a mordida to the gangs.
- A bite.

26:10.403 --> 26:13.322
A bite, right.
The gangs kick up to eMe.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.783
It's an ecosystem.
And you can't change it.

26:15.825 --> 26:17.618
You can nibble around
the edges, but in the end,

26:17.660 --> 26:19.245
eMe endures.

26:19.287 --> 26:21.539
Makes you wonder, don't it?

26:21.580 --> 26:23.958
Every day.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.335
[Lopez] Our brothers and sisters
are in mourning.

26:26.377 --> 26:29.005
This is a crushing tragedy
to happen to our community,

26:29.046 --> 26:31.632
and our thoughts and prayers
are with the families.

26:31.674 --> 26:33.634
And now I'll turn things
over to Chief Irving

26:33.676 --> 26:37.096
who will say a few words
and take a few questions.

26:37.138 --> 26:40.308
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.852
We're just in the initial phase
of our investigation.

26:42.893 --> 26:45.855
We're interviewing witnesses,
pursuing leads

26:45.896 --> 26:48.065
and bringing the full resources

26:48.107 --> 26:50.109
of the Los Angeles
Police Department to bear.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.902
- [car door closes]
- [engine starts]

26:51.944 --> 26:53.154
Questions?

26:54.196 --> 26:55.406
[Barrel] Hmm.

26:56.741 --> 26:59.493
- Mm.
- Thunder road.

26:59.535 --> 27:02.330
- Ha. Hey, stop.
Hold it right there.
- Mm-hmm.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.207
Okay, back it up. There.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.001
Eureka.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.671
Last three digits.

27:10.713 --> 27:13.215
It's a start.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.343
One last question.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.637
Is it true that the body
of the Little Tamale Girl

27:18.679 --> 27:20.014
- was found...
- I'm sorry?

27:20.056 --> 27:22.641
Sonia Hernandez,
the Little Tamale Girl.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.770
That's what they're calling her.
It's trending online.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.605
Your question?

27:27.646 --> 27:30.524
Is it true she was found
in front of a locked fire door?

27:30.566 --> 27:32.526
That's under investigation.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.570
If it proves true,
we'll refer the matter

27:34.612 --> 27:36.697
to the district attorney.

27:36.739 --> 27:38.741
- Thank you.
- [camera shutters clicking]

27:40.368 --> 27:42.203
Jen.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.288
Irv.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.541
Now, tell me something.
What's with Lopez?

27:47.583 --> 27:49.960
The cold shoulder.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.588
Well, maybe
she doesn't trust you.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.757
Oh, Jen. Still?

27:55.966 --> 27:58.094
You should've given me
a heads-up.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.679
[sighs] Well, you landed
on your feet.

28:00.721 --> 28:02.306
And as for your boss,

28:02.348 --> 28:04.058
my endorsement
put her over the top.

28:05.393 --> 28:08.270
We would have carried
South L.A. without you.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.815
I beg to differ.

28:12.066 --> 28:14.485
I'll convey that to the mayor.

28:22.284 --> 28:23.994
Hey. Come in.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.579
[Edgar] Wanted to see me, L.T.?

28:25.621 --> 28:27.915
Yeah. Harry said
you were sick as a dog.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.084
[laughs softly] I'm good.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.128
Got it out of my system.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.799
Is everything all right, Jerry?

28:36.841 --> 28:38.467
Why do you ask?

28:38.509 --> 28:41.220
Well, I'm concerned about you.

28:41.262 --> 28:43.013
Your performance.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.808
Uh, what about my performance?

28:45.850 --> 28:48.686
It's been a little lackluster
lately.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.397
- You're not yourself.
- Harry put you up to this?

28:51.439 --> 28:53.816
Absolutely not.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.818
I haven't spoken to Bosch
about you.

28:55.860 --> 28:58.446
- He wouldn't tell me
anything anyway.
- Hmm.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.448
I'm fine.

29:01.490 --> 29:02.992
That's all I needed to hear.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.997
[door opens]

29:08.038 --> 29:10.040
[door closes]

29:13.752 --> 29:15.754
- Join you?
- Please.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.931
Scott Anderson has an article
in the paper today.

29:25.973 --> 29:29.351
He's calling the little girl...
what's her name, Sonia?

29:29.393 --> 29:30.936
Sonia Hernandez.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.105
He's calling her
the Little Tamale Girl.

29:33.147 --> 29:34.857
Yeah.

29:34.899 --> 29:38.277
She and her mother
and the other woman who died...

29:38.319 --> 29:41.655
- The pregnant woman?
- Yeah. They were making tamales

29:41.697 --> 29:43.407
for their neighbors
for New Year's.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.076
For good luck.

29:50.206 --> 29:52.374
You know, at my desk at work,

29:52.416 --> 29:56.795
I have pictures
of three young women.

29:56.837 --> 30:01.592
One's Filipina, one's Chinese,
one's Latina.

30:03.511 --> 30:07.973
Undocumented, illegal,
whatever you want to call them.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.642
Immigrants.

30:12.686 --> 30:15.022
And I don't know
their real names.

30:17.024 --> 30:19.235
They've never been identified.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.364
Their bodies have never
been claimed.

30:23.405 --> 30:26.825
No one ever
reported them missing.

30:29.954 --> 30:32.164
Their murders
have never been solved, and...

30:34.166 --> 30:36.126
...probably never will be.

30:38.254 --> 30:41.006
- That's so sad.
- It is.

30:44.969 --> 30:47.137
Why do you keep them?

30:47.179 --> 30:49.014
The pictures?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.726
To remind me.

30:52.768 --> 30:55.813
Everybody counts
or nobody counts.

31:02.736 --> 31:05.531
[car horns honking]

31:07.741 --> 31:09.743
[exhales]

31:12.329 --> 31:14.623
- They're gonna fire me.
- Not gonna happen.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.875
You might get dinged
for tactics, that's it.

31:16.917 --> 31:20.421
The department responds
to external pressure.

31:20.462 --> 31:22.923
There hasn't been any,
not even a lawsuit.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.592
Who's gonna sue?

31:24.633 --> 31:26.176
Avril had a gun.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.928
Good shoot, end of story.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.308
They're ready for you,
Detective.

31:32.349 --> 31:34.351
After you.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.832
[Sales] Detective Edgar,
the board has reviewed

31:56.874 --> 31:58.334
the FID investigation

31:58.375 --> 32:00.336
of the officer-involved
shooting that resulted

32:00.377 --> 32:02.338
in the death of Jacques Avril.

32:02.379 --> 32:05.215
As to the tactics,

32:05.257 --> 32:07.301
the board finds that
the tactics you employed

32:07.343 --> 32:09.678
to be out of policy

32:09.720 --> 32:11.639
and subject
to disciplinary review.

32:13.349 --> 32:17.811
As to the drawing, exhibiting
and discharging of your firearm,

32:17.853 --> 32:19.730
the board finds

32:19.772 --> 32:22.358
that you acted within policy.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.528
As to the disciplinary review,

32:26.570 --> 32:29.323
the board has determined that
you displayed poor judgment.

32:29.365 --> 32:33.077
Your failure to notify
communications of your location,

32:33.118 --> 32:35.371
and your decision
to enter that location

32:35.412 --> 32:38.874
without requesting
or waiting for backup officers,

32:38.916 --> 32:42.252
directly contributed
to the adverse outcome.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.799
You are hereby ordered
to schedule a tactical

32:46.840 --> 32:49.093
remediation session
at the Police Academy

32:49.134 --> 32:51.637
to be completed not more
than 90 days from now.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.724
[indistinct chatter]

33:01.814 --> 33:04.316
Hey. I'll take those.

33:04.358 --> 33:06.068
She's been on the phone
all morning.

33:06.110 --> 33:07.361
What's going on?

33:08.404 --> 33:10.280
Hush-hush. New client.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.449
Big case brewing.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.160
So, how'd you like the party?

33:16.495 --> 33:17.871
Party?

33:17.913 --> 33:20.582
Chandler's party.
New Year's Eve.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.252
It was okay.

33:23.293 --> 33:24.962
We left early.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.006
I didn't get invited.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.591
Oh.

33:29.633 --> 33:30.926
What'd you do?

33:30.968 --> 33:34.012
I stayed in, streamed.

33:34.054 --> 33:36.807
Well, you didn't miss anything.

33:36.849 --> 33:39.852
- Mm.
- See you later.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.022
Tactical remediation?

33:44.064 --> 33:45.566
I'd rather take days.

33:45.607 --> 33:48.026
It's one morning at the Academy.
No big deal.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.820
You got 90 days to get it done.

33:49.862 --> 33:51.905
Stuck with a bunch of baby cops

33:51.947 --> 33:54.366
shooting at paper targets.
It's humiliating.

33:54.408 --> 33:56.660
Congratulations.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.203
Lang.

33:58.245 --> 33:59.705
Got off easy.

33:59.747 --> 34:02.082
You heard the man.
It was a good shooting.

34:02.124 --> 34:03.333
Was it?

34:03.375 --> 34:05.169
Or was it an execution?

34:05.210 --> 34:07.087
Fuck off.

34:07.129 --> 34:10.132
- I still have questions.
- Get in line.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.721
So, how do you want
to play this?

34:15.763 --> 34:17.431
Hold back the fire door

34:17.473 --> 34:19.558
till we get their story
locked in.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.393
All right.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.440
Must feel relieved.

34:27.858 --> 34:30.444
I guess.

34:30.486 --> 34:32.654
So, we all good now?

34:32.696 --> 34:34.239
Everything copacetic?

34:34.281 --> 34:36.116
Get our shit together?

34:36.158 --> 34:39.870
Like the old song says,
straighten up, fly right?

34:39.912 --> 34:41.872
I've moved on.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.124
You're the one needs to move on.

34:44.166 --> 34:46.043
Partner.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.507
Right.

34:52.674 --> 34:55.135
[Hines] ...the indictment
and arrest of Vincent Franzen,

34:55.177 --> 34:58.055
millionaire hedge fund manager,

34:58.096 --> 35:01.391
in a $200 million
phony gold bullion Ponzi scheme.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.977
Damn. Look at that.

35:04.019 --> 35:06.480
Fort fucking Knox.

35:06.522 --> 35:10.526
This pyramid that you see here
is not a stack of gold bars.

35:12.528 --> 35:15.322
- It's not?
- [Hines] It's a pile
of balsa wood

35:15.364 --> 35:17.574
spray-painted gold to lure

35:17.616 --> 35:21.078
hundreds of credulous investors
into a massive Ponzi scheme.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.412
Could've fooled me.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.289
[Hines] So,
let's start the new year right

35:24.331 --> 35:26.917
by prosecuting
some real criminals,

35:26.959 --> 35:29.419
crooks who steal
people's life savings,

35:29.461 --> 35:31.505
their pensions, who prey

35:31.547 --> 35:33.131
upon the elderly and gullible.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.008
Amen, sister.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.010
[Evans] The company purchased
the building nine months ago

35:37.052 --> 35:38.720
and has been trying
to bring it up to code.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.389
By running the dealers off.

35:40.430 --> 35:43.058
First and foremost, yes.
Getting rid of the drugs.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.102
And that's why
we brought in Mr. Rojas.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.771
Must have known there'd be
pushback from the gangbangers.

35:47.813 --> 35:50.566
We never expected this.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.277
A terrible tragedy.

35:53.318 --> 35:56.113
What about the locked fire door?

35:56.154 --> 35:59.616
That's on the tenants.
We had nothing to do

35:59.658 --> 36:01.785
with that
unfortunate circumstance.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.454
District attorney
might feel otherwise.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.583
We passed every city inspection
with flying colors.

36:07.624 --> 36:09.835
No, I'm sure your attorneys
are standing by.

36:09.877 --> 36:12.588
Some of your tenants are worried
about gentrification.

36:12.629 --> 36:14.798
We're not trying
to push anyone out.

36:14.840 --> 36:18.468
But the fact of the matter is
this neighborhood's changing.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.846
It's only a matter of time.

36:23.891 --> 36:26.560
"Unfortunate circumstance"
my ass.

36:26.602 --> 36:28.020
If that door hadn't been locked,

36:28.061 --> 36:29.396
that little girl
would still be alive.

36:29.438 --> 36:30.772
You don't think
they ordered up a hit

36:30.814 --> 36:32.149
on their own property, do you?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.026
Easier ways
to gentrify a building.

36:34.067 --> 36:37.404
I think they aren't above using
the gangs to their own ends.

36:37.446 --> 36:40.574
- Too cynical?
- Probably not.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.415
There he is.

36:48.457 --> 36:49.917
Man of the hour.

36:49.958 --> 36:52.210
[Crate] Congratulations, buddy.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.630
- We knew it was a good shoot.
- Never in doubt.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.215
You guys getting anywhere
on the car?

36:57.257 --> 36:59.092
Changing the subject.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.886
Modest to a fault, this guy.

37:00.928 --> 37:04.306
Mm-hmm. We got the partial.
We're working it.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.934
Just a matter of time
before the dominoes fall.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.810
Cool. Let me know.

37:08.852 --> 37:10.437
[Crate] Mm-hmm.

37:13.857 --> 37:15.817
- [door opens]
- Hmm.

37:15.859 --> 37:19.404
For a guy who just got
a "pass go, collect 200 bucks,"

37:19.446 --> 37:21.782
he seems strangely blasé.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.660
It just hasn't sunk in yet.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.079
Must be it.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.082
I saw the press conference.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.125
What is her problem?

37:32.167 --> 37:34.294
Oh, the mayor?

37:34.336 --> 37:36.296
So disrespectful
to leave like that

37:36.338 --> 37:37.506
as soon as you started speaking.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.633
I think she may be having
second thoughts

37:39.675 --> 37:40.926
about my second term.

37:40.968 --> 37:42.761
You helped get her elected.

37:42.803 --> 37:44.846
Well, she seems
to think otherwise.

37:44.888 --> 37:47.140
Why would she not want you
to have a second term?

37:47.182 --> 37:49.643
[sighs] Maybe she wants
to bring in someone new,

37:49.685 --> 37:53.021
someone not associated
with the Ramos administration.

37:53.063 --> 37:55.482
An outsider,
a-a woman, a Latino.

37:55.524 --> 37:57.985
What about the Commission?
Aren't they on your side?

37:58.026 --> 38:00.153
Right now they are.
Three to two in my favor.

38:00.195 --> 38:01.655
Well, there you go.

38:01.697 --> 38:03.448
I think you're worrying
about nothing.

38:03.490 --> 38:05.033
I have to get to the hospital.

38:05.075 --> 38:07.285
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, no, it's my turn.

38:07.327 --> 38:09.788
You sure? I don't mind.

38:09.830 --> 38:11.999
You stay here and brood.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.584
What I do best.

38:14.626 --> 38:18.088
[sighs]

38:18.130 --> 38:20.090
[operator] 911. What's
the nature of your emergency?

38:20.132 --> 38:21.967
[Rojas] I want to report
drugs being sold

38:22.009 --> 38:23.844
- at my apartment complex.
- [operator] Your name?

38:23.885 --> 38:25.303
[Rojas] Eduardo Rojas.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.930
[operator] Tell me
exactly what's going on.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.890
[Rojas] This is all
Las Palmas 13.

38:28.932 --> 38:31.476
Mickey Peña, the dealers,
they work for La Mayorista.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.186
[operator] What's
the location, sir?

38:34.730 --> 38:36.648
Mr. Franzen.

38:36.690 --> 38:40.027
Ms. Chandler.
Am I glad to see you.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.445
How are you faring?

38:41.486 --> 38:43.780
I-I'm not.
When can you get me out of here?

38:43.822 --> 38:46.742
Well, tomorrow morning,
we'll have a bail hearing.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.535
Wait, I have
to stay here tonight?

38:48.577 --> 38:50.120
I'm afraid so.

38:50.162 --> 38:52.497
Jesus.

38:52.539 --> 38:55.042
You don't understand. I'm...

38:55.083 --> 38:57.127
You'll be on keep away status.

38:57.169 --> 38:59.671
A cell to yourself.
You'll be safe.

39:00.714 --> 39:03.008
All right. Great.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.593
Thank God for that.

39:04.634 --> 39:07.012
Uh, D.A. wants to make
an example of you.

39:07.054 --> 39:09.473
She's gonna ask
for pie-in-the-sky bail.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.183
I know the judge.

39:11.224 --> 39:13.143
We'll counter. Hondle a little.

39:13.185 --> 39:14.311
"Hondle"?

39:14.352 --> 39:16.688
Haggle. Bargain. Negotiate.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.607
No, I-I know what it means.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.484
I'm just a little surprised
that you do.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.110
Why?

39:22.152 --> 39:23.737
Well, I mean, come on,
you're just a...

39:23.779 --> 39:25.155
I mean, look at you.
You're such a...

39:25.197 --> 39:27.407
- Shiksa?
- Yeah.

39:27.449 --> 39:30.243
My first husband was Jewish.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.621
That's good to know.

39:32.662 --> 39:35.791
So, ballpark?

39:36.833 --> 39:38.418
Under two.

39:38.460 --> 39:40.420
[sighs]

39:40.462 --> 39:42.380
I can do that.

39:42.422 --> 39:44.007
Oh, I know you can.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.218
I made sure of it.

39:46.259 --> 39:49.137
Try to get some rest.
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:49.179 --> 39:51.932
- Okay.
- Chin up. Don't talk to anyone,

39:51.973 --> 39:53.225
even your wife.

39:53.266 --> 39:56.478
And remember,
all calls are recorded.

39:57.521 --> 39:59.356
Okay.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.404
Yes, sir.

40:06.446 --> 40:09.282
Someone will reach out to you.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.245
You're welcome.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.872
Again, I'm very sorry
for your loss.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.309

40:38.353 --> 40:39.896
