WEBVTT

00:05.120 --> 00:06.709
When we get sick,

00:06.710 --> 00:09.079
our bodies launch
a coordinated defense.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.620
It's called the immune response.

00:15.670 --> 00:17.460
They scheduled my hearing.

00:19.210 --> 00:21.749
"The medical commission will
gladly expedite your process

00:21.750 --> 00:23.039
and give you the date of..."

00:23.040 --> 00:25.039
That's in three months!

00:25.040 --> 00:26.960
Okay, well, that's...
That's not that bad.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.209
I'll have to go
to the Department of Corrections

00:30.210 --> 00:32.249
to get a day off
to see if I'm still a doctor.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.039
You should go
dressed like this when you go.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.119
It's good, right?!

00:35.120 --> 00:36.419
It's an impressive
fashion statement.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.879
It's my disguise.
Once a germ's detected...

00:38.880 --> 00:40.619
Have a nice day. Oh, look out for needles.
Thanks. Yeah.

00:40.620 --> 00:43.459
A team of white blood cells,
proteins, and chemicals

00:43.460 --> 00:44.749
swarm to mount an attack.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.169
You a doctor?

00:46.170 --> 00:47.539
For the moment.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.289
I was wondering if maybe
you could take a look at this.

00:49.290 --> 00:51.209
Time to go, people.

00:51.210 --> 00:53.379
Steam burn from an iron.
I work at a dry cleaner's.

00:53.380 --> 00:54.789
They told me to run it
under cold water,

00:54.790 --> 00:56.539
but it blistered.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.169
They should've sent you
to the doctor.

00:58.170 --> 00:59.170
Is it bad?

00:59.171 --> 01:00.499
Well, it's definitely infected.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.619
It needs debridement
and antibiotics.

01:02.620 --> 01:05.419
So, are you gonna give me
that stuff or what?

01:05.420 --> 01:07.039
These cells catch up
to the invaders and latch on,

01:07.040 --> 01:09.119
destroying them in their wake.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.460
People, let's go!

01:12.040 --> 01:14.459
Or at least that's
what they're supposed to do.

01:14.460 --> 01:15.829
Mm-hmm.

01:15.830 --> 01:18.169
Okay, I, uh... I don't know
what the special occasion is,

01:18.170 --> 01:20.209
but, uh, I want it noted

01:20.210 --> 01:23.039
I do not miss
the green smoothies.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.919
The occasion is that
I have no joy.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.209
My best surgeons work elsewhere,

01:28.210 --> 01:29.919
and Catherine gave away my job.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.539
Oh, but you still have a job.

01:31.540 --> 01:33.289
Mm, I have a job,

01:33.290 --> 01:37.619
but then a man,
a man who I can't stand,

01:37.620 --> 01:41.789
has another job,
and he has a title above my job.

01:41.790 --> 01:43.329
Where's my joy, Ben?

01:43.330 --> 01:46.079
Let me tell you something
about the woman I married.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.419
She don't let anything stop her.

01:50.420 --> 01:55.459
No surgery, no intern,
and certainly no man.

01:55.460 --> 01:57.919
Now, you go back in there,

01:57.920 --> 02:00.789
and you take your joy back.

02:00.790 --> 02:02.419
The body's ability to come back

02:02.420 --> 02:04.020
depends on
what you have to fight with...

02:05.290 --> 02:07.580
and how strong you are.

02:10.210 --> 02:13.789
You don't have to go back
to work if you're not ready.

02:13.790 --> 02:16.579
Mm, it's time.

02:16.580 --> 02:19.209
It's time for me to go back
and let everyone stare at me

02:19.210 --> 02:21.209
like I'm some rare,
delicate bird

02:21.210 --> 02:22.669
that might shed all my feathers

02:22.670 --> 02:24.999
and fly naked through
the hospital at any moment.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.790
I would definitely
like to see that.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.119
You know, you can always
come work for me.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.669
Nobody knows who you are
or what happened.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.619
You could run
your own fellowship,

02:34.620 --> 02:36.290
be your own boss,
keep all your feathers.

02:37.620 --> 02:39.829
My therapist, Michelle,
says it's important

02:39.830 --> 02:43.619
that I try to return
to the life I left, you know,

02:43.620 --> 02:46.579
revisit my routine without
changing things up too much.

02:46.580 --> 02:48.379
You just don't want to work
at Pac-North.

02:48.380 --> 02:49.789
Mm.

02:49.790 --> 02:53.789
Is it appropriate for me
to tell Link in a text?

02:53.790 --> 02:56.619
So I can avoid having to
look him in the eye while I say,

02:56.620 --> 02:58.709
"Hey, remember
how careful we were?

02:58.710 --> 03:00.330
Not careful enough, Daddy!"

03:03.170 --> 03:05.829
You kept medical textbooks here?

03:05.830 --> 03:07.539
I like to study.

03:07.540 --> 03:09.170
It was a sex thing, wasn't it?

03:10.170 --> 03:12.249
Look, you're a decent person,

03:12.250 --> 03:13.539
and Link is a decent person.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.750
He deserves a face-to-face.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.829
Is it poor form for me
to steal all the toilet paper

03:18.830 --> 03:20.499
since I'm the one
who always bought it?

03:20.500 --> 03:23.579
Mm, I already stole
two protein bars.

03:23.580 --> 03:25.209
Ew, yikes.

03:25.210 --> 03:27.709
"Yikes"? What, "Yikes"?

03:27.710 --> 03:28.749
Nothing.

03:28.750 --> 03:32.039
I... Jackson posted
a sunset photo

03:32.040 --> 03:33.709
from his balcony last night.

03:33.710 --> 03:35.580
Oh, let me see it.

03:40.420 --> 03:43.329
"#Freedom"?

03:43.330 --> 03:46.710
I said, "Ew."

03:49.330 --> 03:51.000
Dr. Emma Griggs, report...

03:52.750 --> 03:54.289
Hey. Hey.

03:54.290 --> 03:56.289
First day back, right?

03:56.290 --> 03:58.039
Yeah. Morning, Tom.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.499
Oh, shoot.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.119
Is this weird for you?

04:01.120 --> 04:03.619
We've all shared the same,
mm, how should I say it?

04:03.620 --> 04:04.749
You shouldn't. Pastimes?

04:04.750 --> 04:05.829
Lady friends?

04:05.830 --> 04:06.999
You have poo on your collar.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.379
What? Where? Made you look.

04:08.380 --> 04:10.879
Oh, you are such a stand-up guy.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.879
Leaving Teddy all alone
in a motel with a new baby.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.249
What are you
still doing here, Tom? Hmm?

04:15.250 --> 04:16.829
Don't you have a job
back in Baltimore,

04:16.829 --> 04:18.249
or did you lose that, too?

04:18.250 --> 04:20.170
That's a funny way
to talk to your boss.

04:21.209 --> 04:22.539
What, Teddy didn't tell you?

04:22.540 --> 04:24.039
Tell me what?

04:24.040 --> 04:25.419
Oh, since your friends
went rogue,

04:25.420 --> 04:27.209
Catherine made me God
of this place.

04:27.210 --> 04:28.749
So, practice kneeling.

04:28.750 --> 04:30.459
Maybe throw in a few prayers.

04:30.460 --> 04:31.670
Hmm.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.379
Oh. Oh, no.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.170
After me.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:51.750 --> 04:53.619
Nice of you all
to finally show up.

04:53.620 --> 04:55.459
We're gonna do things
differently today.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.419
Keep up or get out of my sight.

04:57.420 --> 05:01.379
55-year-old male, presents with

05:01.380 --> 05:04.249
weakness of the hips
after walking short distances

05:04.250 --> 05:06.379
and erectile dysfunction.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.499
Who do you think's gonna have to
clean the window after this?

05:08.500 --> 05:09.709
Whoever asked that question.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.919
Now, someone tell me
what to do first.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.749
Check distal pulses, ABIs.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.209
And if needed,
proceed with CT Angio.

05:15.210 --> 05:17.669
Who is he? Who are you?

05:17.670 --> 05:18.919
He's Koracick's protÃ©gÃ©.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.419
Fifth year from Hopkins.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.459
We are rounding, not talking.

05:22.460 --> 05:28.460
Now, physical exam revealed
non-palpable femoral pulses,

05:28.830 --> 05:33.789
low ABIs, and the angio shows

05:33.790 --> 05:36.499
near-complete blockage of
blood flow in the distal aorta.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.329
Diagnosis?
Together: Leriche syndrome.

05:38.330 --> 05:39.420
Leriche syndrome.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.920
Little late, Qadri.

05:41.921 --> 05:43.201
They're three years ahead of us.

05:44.540 --> 05:47.829
See, uh, you all have been
sulking around

05:47.830 --> 05:49.459
for the last month

05:49.460 --> 05:52.459
since I made changes
to the attending staff.

05:52.460 --> 05:56.209
But Alex Karev and Meredith Grey
are my creations.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.829
I made them
the surgeons they are.

05:58.830 --> 06:00.249
And I will make new ones.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.619
So, do you want to be
the new Grey and Karev,

06:02.620 --> 06:04.789
or do you want
to keep making excuses?

06:04.790 --> 06:06.789
I want to be Grey. Karev!

06:06.790 --> 06:08.749
Grey and Karev would have been
studying the case by now.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.209
Go.

06:10.210 --> 06:12.420
Ah!

06:14.790 --> 06:16.789
I want it noted
that I would never

06:16.790 --> 06:18.789
send a message through Instagram
because I am mature.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.079
Very mature.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.619
But if I did,
it would be "#Happier,"

06:22.620 --> 06:23.919
"#INoLongerHaveToPlaySmall-

06:23.920 --> 06:25.749
ToThreatenMenAndTheir-
ThreatenedEgoes."

06:25.750 --> 06:28.539
Mine would be "#JokesOnMe."

06:28.540 --> 06:29.829
I just told Link

06:29.830 --> 06:32.289
I didn't want
to fast-track our relationship.

06:32.290 --> 06:33.999
You're sure I have to tell him?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.959
Whoa!

06:36.960 --> 06:39.039
You're right.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.749
I know. I have to.

06:40.750 --> 06:41.750
Go, go, go, go! Aah!

06:46.040 --> 06:48.539
The hits just keep coming.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.620
I'll page Hunt.

06:50.670 --> 06:53.380
Sir? Sir? Lay still.

06:58.170 --> 06:59.329
Dr. Richie to Peds.

06:59.330 --> 07:00.669
Dr. Nancy Richie,
report to Peds.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.539
Hey, happy first day!

07:02.540 --> 07:04.039
Is it?

07:04.040 --> 07:07.119
You hired me as general
surgery residency director.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.999
I've met only two residents.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.499
Where are the rest of them?

07:10.500 --> 07:13.249
There are only two in
the entire program. Huh?

07:13.250 --> 07:14.539
And none of the attendings

07:14.540 --> 07:16.459
want to put those two residents
on their service.

07:16.460 --> 07:18.039
What was the word
they used to describe them?

07:18.040 --> 07:19.879
Oh, right. "Incompetent."

07:19.880 --> 07:21.919
And would you like to know
what the residents said?

07:21.920 --> 07:23.209
I feel like
you're gonna tell me.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.459
They are so overworked with scut

07:25.460 --> 07:28.039
they don't have time
to hone their mediocre skills.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.619
Alright, isn't this why
I hired you?

07:29.620 --> 07:32.829
I need a class of more than
two residents, Karev!

07:32.830 --> 07:34.379
I need a skills lab for them,

07:34.380 --> 07:35.999
a core curriculum,
visiting professors.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.419
Chief Karev? You know what...

07:37.420 --> 07:38.829
There's an inspector upstairs

07:38.830 --> 07:41.250
who says the helipad elevator
isn't up to code.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.579
Did you know this hospital
was ranked number one?

07:44.580 --> 07:46.209
What decade? This one.

07:46.210 --> 07:47.959
It's number one
in mortality rates,

07:47.960 --> 07:49.959
physician burn-out,
patient dissatisfaction,

07:49.960 --> 07:51.499
and malpractice claims.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.999
A bunch of suits
gave me a big pile of money,

07:53.000 --> 07:54.379
and you said
I could turn it around.

07:54.380 --> 07:57.000
This was your idea. So help.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.500
You said I'd have an office!

08:05.120 --> 08:07.000
Sir? Sir, I'm Dr. Hunt.

08:08.210 --> 08:09.329
Do you have any pain
in your neck?

08:09.330 --> 08:11.039
A little, but more in my chest.

08:11.040 --> 08:11.960
It's fine. I'm okay.

08:11.961 --> 08:13.039
C-collar's secured.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.499
Okay.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.249
The scooter... Is it totaled?

08:17.250 --> 08:19.079
I'm gonna say yes.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.039
Ohh, I stole my girlfriend's
credit card for the rental.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.539
Well, she bought it now.

08:23.540 --> 08:24.999
We ready to move? Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.079
On "three." One, two, three.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.829
Let's go.

08:28.830 --> 08:30.620
Don't embarrass me.

08:33.460 --> 08:37.419
Um, W-Wade Foltz,
suffers from Leriche syndrome.

08:37.419 --> 08:39.249
Due to a build-up of plaque
in his arteries,

08:39.250 --> 08:41.119
he no longer has sufficient
blood flow to his legs

08:41.120 --> 08:45.380
and his, um... Gentleman parts?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.379
Sure.

08:48.380 --> 08:51.789
History includes a pack-a-day
smoker for 25 years,

08:51.790 --> 08:54.039
elevated BP for 10,

08:54.040 --> 08:56.209
and adhesions
from a sigmoid resection

08:56.210 --> 08:58.919
due to repeated bouts
of diverticulitis.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.209
Hmm.

09:00.210 --> 09:01.620
How long
have you been symptomatic?

09:02.620 --> 09:04.379
Well, I went to my, uh, doctor

09:04.380 --> 09:07.249
about a Viagra prescription
about nine months ago.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.539
Schmitt?
Something you'd like to share?

09:09.540 --> 09:14.039
Um... patient emergency.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.460
Then what are you
still doing here?

09:19.040 --> 09:20.619
DeLuca?

09:20.620 --> 09:21.620
Right.

09:21.621 --> 09:24.039
Uh, today we'll be doing
a surgery called

09:24.040 --> 09:25.619
an axillary bi-femoral-bypass.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.829
We will essentially
be creating a tunnel

09:27.830 --> 09:30.119
from your armpit
down to your groin with a graft,

09:30.120 --> 09:32.459
which will then redirect
blood flow to all of those,

09:32.460 --> 09:35.119
uh, poorly perfused areas.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.619
Okay, trauma one's free.

09:36.620 --> 09:38.289
- Be right there.
- Yeah.

09:38.290 --> 09:39.829
I heard about the parking lot.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.919
Everyone okay? Uh, we are fine.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.619
He is hemodynamically stable

09:43.620 --> 09:45.039
with no neurological deficits.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.209
Hey, how's freedom?

09:46.210 --> 09:47.829
You enjoying it? What's that?

09:47.830 --> 09:49.039
Oh, no. The sexy firefighter.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.379
She's freedom, right?

09:50.380 --> 09:52.079
Freedom from having to
live with someone

09:52.080 --> 09:54.079
who intellectually
challenges you?

09:54.080 --> 09:56.249
A surgeon dating a firefighter.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.379
You get to feel superior
all the time.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.789
Nice.

09:59.790 --> 10:02.709
It wasn't. That was the point.

10:02.710 --> 10:04.119
- Hey.
- Ah.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.669
Maggie, I should...

10:05.670 --> 10:06.959
Yeah. If you or Owen need
me, just page.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.619
Go.

10:08.620 --> 10:09.829
- Dr. Wendy Bliss to Oncology.
- Dr. Wendy Bliss to Oncology.

10:09.830 --> 10:10.880
Let's call X-ray.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.249
Hi.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.039
Hey!

10:16.040 --> 10:18.790
Uh, uh, could we go
somewhere private?

10:20.080 --> 10:22.040
Uh, not that kind of private.

10:23.040 --> 10:25.579
Oh. Oh! Bad private?

10:25.580 --> 10:26.580
No. No. I just...

10:26.581 --> 10:27.999
You-met-someone-else
kind of private?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.380
Pregnant, actually.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.959
I know! It's absurd!

10:32.960 --> 10:34.419
But it's also true.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.619
Uh, judging from my last period,

10:36.620 --> 10:38.670
I'm thinking eight weeks or so.

10:40.290 --> 10:43.379
And, um, I'm not
asking you for anything.

10:43.380 --> 10:44.789
I just want to avoid

10:44.790 --> 10:47.539
any kind of secret-keeping
or hand-wringing.

10:47.540 --> 10:49.249
Uh, also, I don't have

10:49.250 --> 10:51.289
the best track record
with pregnancy,

10:51.290 --> 10:53.249
which is a story
I should probably tell you.

10:53.250 --> 10:57.249
Um... Head trauma coming in.
I got to go.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.530
Can... Can we finish this later?

10:59.710 --> 11:02.210
Okay.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.289
Dr. Bailey! Chief! Hi. Hi.

11:12.290 --> 11:13.419
Karev?

11:13.420 --> 11:16.419
I didn't know
you were coming back today.

11:16.420 --> 11:19.329
I didn't know
if you were coming back at all.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.119
Thank you,
for all of your help last month.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.829
I was in bad shape,
but I am better now.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.249
I'm rested,

11:25.250 --> 11:26.879
and I'm seeing someone
on a regular basis and...

11:26.880 --> 11:28.919
I mean I didn't know if you were
coming back to Grey-Sloan.

11:28.920 --> 11:32.959
I thought you might join
the other Dr. Karev

11:32.960 --> 11:35.669
in his new... endeavor.

11:35.670 --> 11:38.579
Oh, well, he did offer me
my own fellowship,

11:38.580 --> 11:41.039
with no oversight,
but, um... Did he?

11:41.040 --> 11:42.419
Well, as it happens,

11:42.420 --> 11:44.539
my plate is fuller than ever

11:44.540 --> 11:47.669
with all the groundbreaking
things we do here.

11:47.670 --> 11:51.249
So, um, I will need to take
a step back from the fellowship,

11:51.250 --> 11:55.079
and give you more free rein
to pursue and develop

11:55.080 --> 11:56.249
as you see fit.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.460
Does that sound appealing?

11:59.380 --> 12:03.119
Um... I-I... Take the day.
Think about it.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.120
Let me know.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.169
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

12:09.170 --> 12:10.499
How... How...
How do you know Meredith?

12:10.500 --> 12:11.789
Community work crew.

12:11.790 --> 12:14.119
She said to come here,
ask for Dr. Webber.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.209
He would get a CT of my head.

12:16.210 --> 12:18.379
Uh, what's wrong with your head?

12:18.380 --> 12:19.829
I was running really fast,
away from these people,

12:19.830 --> 12:21.419
because they thought that
I had stolen someone's car.

12:21.420 --> 12:23.999
But I... Uh, you
know, n-never mind.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.920
Uh, uh, hang tight.

12:26.920 --> 12:27.959
- Dr. Brown to Imaging.
- Dr. Brown to Imaging.

12:27.960 --> 12:28.999
I need a pen.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.079
Uh, where are the CT orders?

12:31.080 --> 12:33.579
Uh, CT's out.
What do you mean, "out"?

12:33.580 --> 12:35.169
Broken, I guess.

12:35.170 --> 12:37.209
Well, shouldn't we close
to trauma, then?

12:37.210 --> 12:38.249
What?

12:38.250 --> 12:40.039
Should we close to trauma?

12:40.040 --> 12:42.039
Look, I asked an hour ago,

12:42.040 --> 12:44.919
but, uh, rigs keep showing up
with some more patients.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.419
Oh, man. Do we have pens?!

12:46.420 --> 12:49.039
- Any pens that work?!
- Oh, my God.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.999
Hey, are you Dr. Webber?

12:51.000 --> 12:53.419
Um, can I help you?

12:53.420 --> 12:55.079
I'm friends with Meredith Grey.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.459
Dear God.

12:57.460 --> 13:00.039
So, what you want
to do is go to Pac-North.

13:00.040 --> 13:03.289
You want to see either
Alex Karev or Richard Webber.

13:03.290 --> 13:05.459
Tell them you're a friend
of Meredith Grey's

13:05.460 --> 13:08.039
and you want to get
an ultrasound on that leg.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.459
Okay. Okay.

13:10.460 --> 13:11.829
You got my stuff?

13:11.830 --> 13:14.619
Lidocaine, gauze, uh,
scalpels, bandages, saline.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.079
Am I gonna get arrested?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.959
I feel like
I'm gonna get arrested.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.329
For what?
I just stole from the hospital.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.039
I own the hospital.
That's my stuff.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.419
You just brought me my stuff.

13:23.420 --> 13:24.579
Go set it up.

13:24.580 --> 13:26.079
Who's next? Hey!

13:26.080 --> 13:28.959
So, not only are you not
picking up trash,

13:28.960 --> 13:31.379
but these "patients"
aren't, either.

13:31.380 --> 13:32.879
Who are you?

13:32.880 --> 13:35.829
I don't want to answer.

13:35.830 --> 13:38.999
This isn't
a walk-in clinic, Grey!

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Get back to work.

13:40.001 --> 13:41.499
Come on, let's go, guys.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.829
Get back to work.

13:42.830 --> 13:44.749
People, let's go!

13:44.750 --> 13:46.290
Get back to work!

13:48.460 --> 13:51.209
How long have you had
that lump on your neck?

13:51.210 --> 13:52.879
I noticed it
while you were swallowing.

13:52.880 --> 13:53.880
It's a nodule.

13:53.881 --> 13:55.829
It's oval-shaped.

13:55.830 --> 13:58.379
I could take a look at it
for you if you want.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.170
Or I could get back to work.

14:07.750 --> 14:11.419
Who can tell me
the most difficult part

14:11.420 --> 14:13.249
of an ax-bi-fem bypass?

14:13.250 --> 14:15.709
Subcutaneously tunneling
the graft?

14:15.710 --> 14:17.039
Wrong.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.079
Your prize...
Rectals for the week.

14:19.080 --> 14:23.079
Next incorrect answer gets
to empty bed pans in the ICU.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.669
Helm?

14:24.670 --> 14:28.419
Uh, is it anastomosing the graft
to the axillary artery?

14:28.420 --> 14:30.289
Congratulations.

14:30.290 --> 14:33.209
And that is why you see
vascular instruments

14:33.210 --> 14:35.749
and PTFE grafts in front of you.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.789
Dr. Bailey.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.249
D... What?

14:38.250 --> 14:39.919
Dr. Grey uses Dacron grafts.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.289
And I don't.

14:41.290 --> 14:42.669
Is there a question?
I didn't think so.

14:42.670 --> 14:45.709
For the rest of you,
studies have shown

14:45.710 --> 14:49.289
that one synthetic material
is not superior to another

14:49.290 --> 14:50.789
in this procedure.

14:50.790 --> 14:54.829
Now, the first person
to complete perfect anastomoses

14:54.830 --> 14:56.670
gets to do it in the OR.

14:58.710 --> 15:00.119
You just confirmed

15:00.120 --> 15:02.209
that it was the hardest part
of the surgery.

15:02.210 --> 15:03.810
Then if I were you,
I'd start practicing.

15:07.580 --> 15:10.670
Joy.

15:11.830 --> 15:12.919
Well, Reid, it looks like
you've gotten away

15:12.920 --> 15:14.169
with a few fractures
near your sternum.

15:14.170 --> 15:16.079
You are extremely lucky.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.329
I mean, so is she.

15:17.330 --> 15:19.169
You're the one who hit me.

15:19.170 --> 15:21.169
Hit you?

15:21.170 --> 15:22.379
I could have died.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.999
You were the one
who ran him over?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.459
I-I was sitting still.

15:25.460 --> 15:27.579
You were the one who recklessly
scootered into my car,

15:27.580 --> 15:28.960
like a squirrel
with a death wish.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.329
Okay. No pulse.

15:33.330 --> 15:34.879
What the hell happened?

15:34.880 --> 15:36.959
Ultrasound. He was just stable.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.999
Show me the films.
And did you do an EKG?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.419
No, I just saw rib fractures.

15:40.420 --> 15:42.919
Okay. Let me see that.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.789
Okay, cardiac tamponade.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.039
Let's get a chest rig.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.580
We need to open him up
right away.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.999
Link.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.209
I am being treated
like a commodity.

15:56.210 --> 15:59.379
Like, I-I came back expecting
rare-bird looks,

15:59.380 --> 16:01.119
and instead, I am being offered

16:01.120 --> 16:03.789
total creative control
over my fellowship

16:03.790 --> 16:05.499
by two different hospitals.

16:05.500 --> 16:08.579
I mean,
this doesn't make any sense.

16:08.580 --> 16:11.039
Link? Hey. Are you okay?

16:11.040 --> 16:13.330
Pregnant.

16:14.830 --> 16:16.539
Amelia's pregnant.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.169
From me.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.419
Whoa.

16:20.420 --> 16:21.420
Okay.

16:21.421 --> 16:24.959
Have you two decided
what you want to do?

16:24.960 --> 16:26.379
We didn't get that far.

16:26.380 --> 16:30.290
She, uh...
She got paged to a case.

16:31.580 --> 16:34.789
I guess she's got
some bad history with pregnancy,

16:34.790 --> 16:37.750
so maybe she wants to keep it?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.169
Turn your head.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.709
I noticed it
at my dad's birthday dinner,

16:45.710 --> 16:47.789
which was about
a few months ago.

16:47.790 --> 16:49.289
It hurt to cough.

16:49.290 --> 16:51.879
My primary care physician
looked at it.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.249
You need to see an ENT.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.209
That's exactly what she said.

16:55.210 --> 16:57.289
But insurance took two weeks
to authorize a specialist.

16:57.290 --> 16:58.579
And when I called,

16:58.580 --> 17:00.789
the soonest they could fit me in
was November.

17:00.790 --> 17:03.619
Okay, well, I know someone
who can see you right now.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.789
The crew has two hours left
in the day.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.169
You have two hours left.

17:07.170 --> 17:08.919
Who's gonna know if we leave?

17:08.920 --> 17:10.709
I could lose my job!

17:10.710 --> 17:12.579
Cancer, Robin.

17:12.579 --> 17:14.290
This could be cancer.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.378
Yep.

17:17.380 --> 17:19.118
O-Okay.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.169
L-Let's go.

17:20.170 --> 17:21.618
Schmitt, you're driving.

17:21.619 --> 17:23.460
On my bike?

17:27.960 --> 17:30.209
This is why I don't have
a resident today?

17:30.210 --> 17:32.079
Bailey's holding boot camp?
Mm-hmm.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.749
Uh, without Grey,
Karev, and Webber,

17:33.750 --> 17:34.959
the pressure is on

17:34.960 --> 17:36.959
to improve the caliber
of the surgical department.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.119
Sounds like a lot of work.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.579
I prefer not firing people.

17:39.580 --> 17:42.079
Also, I don't trust bottom
feeders to touch patients.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.329
That's why I don't teach.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.169
Hmm. It's a teaching hospital.

17:45.170 --> 17:48.459
Oh. ER. Good. This is boring.

17:48.460 --> 17:51.499
What does that man have
over your mother?

17:51.500 --> 17:53.459
Probably just saving her life.

17:53.460 --> 17:54.460
Hmm.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.669
Done!

17:57.670 --> 18:00.080
Done! So done!

18:07.380 --> 18:10.169
Alright, Helm will do
the anastomosis this afternoon.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.879
What? I am so Meredith Grey.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.419
Dr. DeLuca, you'll still join us
in the surgery.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.040
Prep the patient
and transport to OR 1.

18:22.210 --> 18:23.919
The patient has a fever...

18:23.920 --> 18:25.789
Okay... No abdominal pain,

18:25.790 --> 18:28.209
the labs are normal,
and a negative CT.

18:28.210 --> 18:30.289
Yet you paged me, a surgeon.

18:30.290 --> 18:31.789
Who should I page?

18:31.790 --> 18:33.999
Anyone but me.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.209
Mer, my ER's over capacity.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.790
You need to send your street
clinic to a different hospital.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.579
Hey. Hey.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.249
Everything okay? How's your day?

18:43.250 --> 18:46.789
Uh, it's weird,
for a couple reasons.

18:46.790 --> 18:49.379
Um, Bailey made me
the same offer you did...

18:49.380 --> 18:51.539
Complete control
over my fellowship.

18:51.540 --> 18:52.999
Did you ask her to do that?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.579
Is that, like,
another pity offer?

18:54.580 --> 18:55.709
What? No way.

18:55.710 --> 18:57.619
Bailey hates me right now.

18:57.620 --> 18:59.169
Look, nobody's giving
you any... Excuse me.

18:59.170 --> 19:00.669
Hi.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.329
Uh, you need to wait
in the chairs.

19:02.330 --> 19:04.209
Look, Jo, if you don't want
to do the fellowship,

19:04.210 --> 19:06.619
um, I will make you full general
surgery attending right now.

19:06.620 --> 19:09.289
The only pity
that needs to be shown

19:09.290 --> 19:10.619
is you coming here to help me.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.749
I'm really sorry
to bother you again,

19:12.750 --> 19:14.669
but the guy
sitting next to me...

19:14.670 --> 19:15.670
I think he's dead.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.210
I got to call you back.

19:28.170 --> 19:30.619
Damn it!

19:30.620 --> 19:33.209
Why is a rib fracture
in a trauma room?

19:33.210 --> 19:35.209
And furthermore,
why is a rib fracture filleted?

19:35.210 --> 19:36.919
Turns out the rib hit the heart.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.919
Suture. We need
to temporize the bleeding.

19:38.920 --> 19:39.999
We still don't have
good pressure.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.919
Just give it a second.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.039
V-Fib. Paddles.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.579
Simms, come to trauma two.

19:44.580 --> 19:47.579
See someone save a life without
turning him into a sautÃ©.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.749
This guy can't die.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.919
I could be charged
with manslaughter

19:51.920 --> 19:52.999
or vehicular homicide.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.709
Clear!

19:54.710 --> 19:56.619
You didn't hit him. He hit you.

19:56.620 --> 19:58.209
I can't go to jail right now.

19:58.210 --> 19:59.619
Mer's already on the verge,

19:59.620 --> 20:01.289
and if I'm in jail
and she's in jail,

20:01.290 --> 20:02.579
then Amelia has the kids

20:02.580 --> 20:04.209
and she cannot handle that
right now.

20:04.210 --> 20:05.249
What's wrong with Amelia?

20:05.250 --> 20:06.709
Uh, nothing.

20:06.710 --> 20:07.919
Charge to 20.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.210
Clear.

20:12.330 --> 20:13.539
So, he was just
half dead in the ER?

20:13.540 --> 20:14.959
Mm-hmm.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.619
Left gastric artery's
compromised.

20:17.620 --> 20:20.039
There's a small area
of necrosis here.

20:20.040 --> 20:21.959
Karev, careful.
You're using too much traction.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.119
If I go any slower, the entire
stomach won't be viable.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.539
And if you perforate it,
he'll be more septic and die.

20:26.540 --> 20:28.119
Do you want me to get someone
else in here?

20:28.120 --> 20:29.999
Because I'd be happy to tag out
and get you another assist.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.619
With one of your subpar
residents? No, thank you.

20:31.620 --> 20:32.919
My subpar residents?

20:32.920 --> 20:34.619
I'm only here because you told
me to come get this job.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.669
I know this, Karev.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.379
That doesn't mean
I want to work here.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.119
You told me to hire you.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.329
I was 15 minutes late
for work this morning,

20:42.330 --> 20:44.249
and I'm never late.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.999
I find it to be an indicator
of laziness.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.329
But I got into my car
this morning,

20:49.330 --> 20:52.119
and I drove to Grey-Sloan
because for the past 35 years,

20:52.120 --> 20:54.289
that's where I've
driven every day.

20:54.290 --> 20:57.169
I spent more of my life in that
building than in my own home.

20:57.170 --> 20:59.169
It's where I was called
"Dr. Webber"

20:59.170 --> 21:00.999
for the very first time.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.959
I figured one day I would just
drop dead in OR 2,

21:03.960 --> 21:05.619
and the thought of that
made me happy.

21:05.620 --> 21:07.829
So, no, Karev,
I don't want to work here.

21:07.830 --> 21:10.039
I want to work at my hospital!

21:10.040 --> 21:11.580
That is no longer an option.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.999
I started chemo when I was 10,
then radiation,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.329
then more chemo, and so on.

21:20.330 --> 21:22.459
I spent my entire childhood
getting poked and prodded

21:22.460 --> 21:23.879
and listening
to my parents fight.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.959
Link, that's not gonna
happen to your kid.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.539
Your cancer wasn't even genetic.

21:28.540 --> 21:31.709
It was random, which is...
I swear to God it's worse.

21:31.710 --> 21:34.119
There's no way to prepare.
I mean, forget cancer.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.579
What sane person turns on
the news and thinks,

21:36.580 --> 21:39.499
"Oh, great, the...
The polar ice caps are melting."

21:39.500 --> 21:42.379
The planet is on fire,
and all of humanity is whining

21:42.380 --> 21:45.169
on Twitter while doing exactly
nothing to prevent any of it.

21:45.170 --> 21:48.669
So, yeah, yeah, I should bring
a baby into this world"?

21:48.670 --> 21:52.459
Sometimes I forget how dark
your dark streak is.

21:52.460 --> 21:57.419
It's her choice, so, uh

21:57.420 --> 22:00.539
if she wants to have this kid,
do I say any of this?

22:00.540 --> 22:02.459
It's her body, her choice, yes.

22:02.460 --> 22:05.790
But you're a person, too.
You get to weigh in.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.920
It's Amelia.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.040
Wait, Link.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.459
You're an excellent friend.

22:27.460 --> 22:30.790
And if it comes down to it,
you will be an excellent dad.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.079
Jo, if people are treating you
like a commodity,

22:37.080 --> 22:38.290
it's because you are.

22:45.580 --> 22:49.079
Don't get fired, don't get
fired, don't get fired.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.289
Why are we in the parking lot?

22:51.290 --> 22:52.749
It's a long story.

22:52.750 --> 22:53.999
But don't you work here?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.829
She used to work here.

22:55.830 --> 22:57.669
It was a whole thing.
Very dramatic.

22:57.670 --> 22:59.079
Why do I think
this must be related

22:59.080 --> 23:01.379
to why you're on my work crew?

23:01.380 --> 23:03.670
It's not unrelated.
Can you hold still, please?

23:05.420 --> 23:07.749
Are you trying to lose your
medical license or what? Oh.

23:07.750 --> 23:09.419
So, Robin, this is Dr. Avery,

23:09.420 --> 23:12.459
the ENT specialist I told you about.
Yeah.

23:12.460 --> 23:15.169
Hey, so, Robin has an enlarging
mass in her neck.

23:15.170 --> 23:17.169
Ultrasound is showing
some concerning features.

23:17.170 --> 23:18.959
You think you could do
a biopsy for me?

23:18.960 --> 23:21.079
Now? It'll take you 20 minutes.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.539
I have surgeries scheduled.

23:22.540 --> 23:25.209
She's got an appointment in two
months with Clark at County.

23:25.210 --> 23:27.329
Clark's an idiot. Right.

23:27.330 --> 23:29.120
Please.

23:30.540 --> 23:32.329
I'll see if I can move
some stuff around.

23:32.330 --> 23:34.119
Will you not practice medicine
in the damn parking lot?

23:34.120 --> 23:36.040
Bailey's gonna see you.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.209
Okay.
Alright, let's start heparin,

23:41.210 --> 23:45.380
and then let's prepare
for anastomoses.

23:47.790 --> 23:49.500
Angled DeBakey, please.

23:52.540 --> 23:54.789
I'll obtain proximal
and distal control

23:54.790 --> 23:57.169
before performing
the arteriotomy.

23:57.170 --> 23:59.079
Alright, now, remember,
the artery is fragile, okay?

23:59.080 --> 24:00.499
So don't be too... Aggressive.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.209
Right. I know.

24:02.210 --> 24:03.709
If anyone's gonna operate
from the sidelines,

24:03.710 --> 24:04.670
DeLuca, it'll be me.

24:04.671 --> 24:06.249
Dr. Bailey! Yes?

24:06.250 --> 24:08.039
I beat her. I beat her time.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.919
Should have beaten her by more
than one second, DeLuca.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.620
Helm, let's get to it.

24:18.420 --> 24:19.919
Oh, God.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.289
How many times
have we shocked him?

24:21.290 --> 24:22.829
18 and multiple rounds of meds.
Come on. Come on.

24:22.830 --> 24:25.249
Another 50 joules.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.710
Clear.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.669
If I wasn't blaming
myself for this,

24:30.670 --> 24:31.789
I would have called it by now,
wouldn't I?

24:31.790 --> 24:33.419
You would and you should.

24:33.420 --> 24:34.499
Not only is he dead,
but you've charred his heart.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.619
- Give it up.
- Oh, God.

24:35.620 --> 24:37.039
Let me try, Pierce.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.039
Let's charge to 50, okay?

24:39.040 --> 24:41.119
And... clear!

24:41.120 --> 24:43.079
You know,
if you two get off on this,

24:43.080 --> 24:44.669
take a set of paddles
down to the morgue,

24:44.670 --> 24:46.879
but at least free up my trauma
room. You hear me, Hunt?

24:46.880 --> 24:49.039
Charge again, and, clear.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.669
We got a rhythm! Ohh!

24:50.670 --> 24:52.289
Let's push epi, and let's get
him up to the OR now!

24:52.290 --> 24:54.379
Aah!

24:54.380 --> 24:55.789
Oh!

24:55.790 --> 24:59.079
Aaaah!

24:59.080 --> 25:00.379
Oh! Crap.

25:00.380 --> 25:01.919
No, no, no, no.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.500
No. Mnh!

25:09.330 --> 25:11.209
That son of a bitch
tried to kill me!

25:11.210 --> 25:12.040
Tom, you should really sit down.

25:12.041 --> 25:13.329
I physically can't!

25:13.330 --> 25:14.789
I had no idea
you were behind me, Tom,

25:14.790 --> 25:16.329
and the paddles
were still charged.

25:16.330 --> 25:18.119
I was just trying
to resuscitate the patient.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.329
You hit him with 50 joules
of electricity.

25:19.330 --> 25:20.579
What the hell is wrong with you?

25:20.580 --> 25:22.499
Simms, go find him a bed
and page urology.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.619
Page Catherine Fox.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.249
I'm not letting
incompetence touch me.

25:25.250 --> 25:27.079
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.540
Aah.

25:29.750 --> 25:33.999
Also, 25 disposable scalpels,
12 bulk packages of bandages,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.499
a lot of 4x4s, bags of saline.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.500
Why are you telling me all this?

25:37.501 --> 25:39.459
I'm a Gryffindor. I'm brave.

25:39.460 --> 25:40.709
I'm scared all the time,

25:40.710 --> 25:43.209
but I am brave
and sometimes stupid.

25:43.210 --> 25:45.379
So, when Dr. Grey called,
I went.

25:45.380 --> 25:49.419
I just do not want to lose
my license or go to jail.

25:49.420 --> 25:52.499
So, when Chief Bailey asks me
why I took those supplies,

25:52.500 --> 25:57.880
I'm hoping maybe you could say
you asked me for them.

26:00.380 --> 26:01.829
Fine.

26:01.830 --> 26:03.789
Here's a sample.

26:03.790 --> 26:06.619
Fine? Really?

26:06.620 --> 26:09.499
Meredith Grey's a good friend
and the best doctor I know.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.039
I'm not scared of getting in
a little bit of trouble

26:11.040 --> 26:12.580
if that means
she's helping someone.

26:14.420 --> 26:15.620
Also a Gryffindor.

26:20.290 --> 26:22.039
I named him Christopher.

26:22.040 --> 26:26.709
I, uh, donated his organs,

26:26.710 --> 26:30.289
and it was the hardest thing
I've ever gone through.

26:30.290 --> 26:35.209
So, the thought of being
pregnant again, um,

26:35.210 --> 26:38.459
the idea of reliving it,
it just, um...

26:38.460 --> 26:42.499
It was always paralyzing.

26:42.500 --> 26:46.079
That is why I am militant
about birth control.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.669
I mean, I've honestly
been on it for so long

26:48.670 --> 26:51.829
I barely get a period anymore,
which is why

26:51.830 --> 26:56.330
it took me a while
to notice... this.

27:00.580 --> 27:05.499
And I've had a long time
to process it,

27:05.500 --> 27:09.249
to grieve him.

27:09.250 --> 27:14.619
But... even though I, uh...

27:14.620 --> 27:17.709
I'm in a privileged
situation now, I'm...

27:17.710 --> 27:21.459
With my sobriety
and with my career,

27:21.460 --> 27:27.460
and even though I could
give a kid a good life,

27:28.960 --> 27:32.619
I just don't think that's
a reason to have a child.

27:32.620 --> 27:35.709
And, um...

27:35.710 --> 27:39.499
And even though the odds of
what happened with Christopher

27:39.500 --> 27:42.419
ever happening again
are like a million to one,

27:42.420 --> 27:47.209
I... I just...

27:47.210 --> 27:48.619
I know I wouldn't survive it.

27:48.620 --> 27:49.920
So, um...

27:58.620 --> 28:00.580
Sorry.

28:11.170 --> 28:13.709
And, uh, I know it's my body,

28:13.710 --> 28:16.670
but, uh, you are free
to have feelings.

28:20.920 --> 28:27.460
Um... Um...

28:29.170 --> 28:35.170
I've spent the day trying to
wrap my head around this, um,

28:35.250 --> 28:39.119
imagining worst-case scenarios

28:39.120 --> 28:42.079
if we actually
went through with this,

28:42.080 --> 28:43.419
a-and I've got about
a million of them.

28:43.420 --> 28:46.709
Cancer, uh, global warming,

28:46.710 --> 28:50.249
gun violence,
antibiotic resistant superbugs.

28:50.250 --> 28:56.290
But, um, talking to you now,
looking at you,

28:56.830 --> 29:00.619
listening to you, and hearing
what you have survived, I...

29:00.620 --> 29:05.119
What I know I don't want

29:05.120 --> 29:08.459
is for anything to hurt you.

29:08.460 --> 29:12.209
That feels real to me.
That feels tangible.

29:12.210 --> 29:16.249
And everything that scares me
suddenly feels irrelevant.

29:16.250 --> 29:21.959
So... if you want
to have this kid,

29:21.960 --> 29:25.749
I-I will suck up my fears and
I'll be a dad because

29:25.750 --> 29:28.749
well, I mean, let's be honest.
Kids love me.

29:28.750 --> 29:30.999
And, um, if you don't want it,

29:31.000 --> 29:34.709
I-I, um... I'll drive you
to the appointment.

29:34.710 --> 29:39.959
I will be there for you
in every way I possibly can.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.039
That's what I know.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.210
That's... That's my feelings.

29:53.670 --> 29:55.620
Damn it, Link!

30:04.120 --> 30:07.209
And... done.

30:07.210 --> 30:08.670
Ready to tie.

30:10.210 --> 30:11.170
Awesome.

30:11.171 --> 30:14.119
Time to remove the first clamp.

30:14.120 --> 30:17.749
And flush the graft.

30:17.750 --> 30:21.330
The graft is...

30:23.120 --> 30:25.499
good.

30:25.500 --> 30:26.749
Mm-hmm.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.079
Air's out.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.000
Now for the second one.

30:31.620 --> 30:32.669
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why... Why's he bleeding?

30:32.670 --> 30:33.999
Where's it from?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.709
Uh, seems to be coming
from your suture line.

30:35.710 --> 30:36.829
Suction. What?!

30:36.830 --> 30:37.959
There's so much blood.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.209
Do something. Fix it.

30:39.210 --> 30:40.749
Why aren't you fixing it?!

30:40.750 --> 30:41.959
Can you fix it?!

30:41.960 --> 30:43.669
I don't know. Can I?

30:43.670 --> 30:46.289
Oh, God. Ohh.

30:46.290 --> 30:47.379
DeLuca.

30:47.380 --> 30:48.709
He's bleeding out too fast,
Bailey.

30:48.710 --> 30:51.289
So, what do you do?

30:51.290 --> 30:54.709
Aah... Clamps.

30:54.710 --> 30:57.039
I'll get proximal
and distal control.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.919
Alright. Ahh.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.999
Alright, coming around.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.790
6-0 Prolene. Right now. Come on.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.919
Thyroid cancer?
Papillary thyroid cancer.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.499
It's the most common
and the most treatable.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.499
You'll need surgery,
possible iodine treatments,

31:22.500 --> 31:26.289
but all of it's
perfectly doable.

31:26.290 --> 31:27.999
If it wasn't for you,
I'd still be waiting

31:28.000 --> 31:30.039
two months to get checked.

31:30.040 --> 31:33.289
And that's if I could
afford the time off.

31:33.290 --> 31:36.119
If I miss work,
I don't get paid.

31:36.120 --> 31:40.249
And if I don't get paid,
I can't pay rent

31:40.250 --> 31:42.539
or I can't pay
for my asthma medication.

31:42.540 --> 31:44.789
Insurance doesn't cover
the cost of the inhaler?

31:44.790 --> 31:47.379
They'll cover one per month.

31:47.380 --> 31:50.999
I shell out $500 a month
if I need another one,

31:51.000 --> 31:53.249
which I'm guessing may be cheap

31:53.250 --> 31:55.619
compared to what it costs
to treat cancer.

31:55.620 --> 31:58.379
We'll make sure you're given
options to consider.

31:58.380 --> 32:00.039
Yeah.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.879
Bankruptcy or death.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.459
Dr. Grey? Are you back?

32:05.460 --> 32:07.079
Is she back?

32:07.080 --> 32:08.539
I'm visiting a friend, Helm.

32:08.540 --> 32:10.250
Walk, Helm.

32:12.880 --> 32:16.329
So, we were able to repair
the hole in his heart,

32:16.330 --> 32:20.249
but it'll be a long road
to recovery.

32:20.250 --> 32:22.079
He steals my credit cards.

32:22.080 --> 32:25.499
He lives in my apartment
and eats my food.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.669
Why do I stay with him?

32:27.670 --> 32:30.499
Because at one point,
things were good.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.579
He made you laugh.
You were attracted to him.

32:32.580 --> 32:36.039
And maybe a quiet part
inside of you raised a red flag

32:36.040 --> 32:37.249
here or there,
but you ignored it because

32:37.250 --> 32:39.579
dating in today's world
is miserable.

32:39.580 --> 32:41.919
It's digital and terrifying,
and, let's be honest,

32:41.920 --> 32:44.289
the pickings are slim for an
educated, independent woman.

32:44.290 --> 32:45.379
So you stayed.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.039
But, Tara, the longer you stay,

32:48.040 --> 32:49.499
the harder it will be to leave.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.379
And maybe you think
that he will leave first,

32:51.380 --> 32:53.209
but if he does that,
then you'll just feel like

32:53.210 --> 32:55.419
a victim, which I think is worse

32:55.420 --> 32:58.080
than just ripping off
the Band-Aid yourself.

33:03.790 --> 33:05.169
Thanks.

33:05.170 --> 33:07.669
Hey. Our guy's stable.
His wife's on the way.

33:07.670 --> 33:10.879
Well, it's nice that one
thing went right today. Yeah.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.079
Hey, Dr. Webber.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.709
I-I didn't want to work here,
either.

33:14.710 --> 33:17.829
You know, at Grey-Sloan,
I inherited a-a legacy.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.539
Bailey's legacy, your legacy.

33:19.540 --> 33:20.959
You know, I mean,
every choice I made,

33:20.960 --> 33:23.959
I heard your voice in my head...
"Don't settle. Do better."

33:23.960 --> 33:26.079
At Grey-Sloan,
failing was our last option.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.919
But here, failure's the culture.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.419
But we can change that.

33:30.420 --> 33:32.289
I mean, dying in an OR
at Grey-Sloan is one plan,

33:32.290 --> 33:35.289
but maybe there is a better plan
for you here.

33:35.290 --> 33:37.209
A new legacy.

33:37.210 --> 33:38.919
Help me turn this place around.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.879
Help me do the impossible.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.620
H-Help me prove Bailey wrong.

33:47.620 --> 33:50.419
Yeah.

33:50.420 --> 33:52.039
Oh, I, uh... I almost forgot.

33:52.040 --> 33:56.289
I had to pull some strings with
maintenance, but, uh, ta-da!

33:56.290 --> 33:57.330
Your office.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.080
Karev! Do better!

34:18.540 --> 34:19.540
You're wrong, you know?

34:22.920 --> 34:26.458
Excuse me?

34:26.460 --> 34:27.920
What you said about Vic.

34:29.330 --> 34:32.789
She's really smart, Maggie,
and she's brave.

34:32.790 --> 34:34.708
And you're right.

34:34.710 --> 34:36.880
She is different from me.

34:38.250 --> 34:41.460
I don't think
that's a bad thing.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.620
Unconsciously, then?

35:01.170 --> 35:02.379
You hear that, Wade?

35:02.380 --> 35:04.419
It's the sound of blood
flowing through your body.

35:04.420 --> 35:06.210
That's good. That's right.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.619
Monitor proximal
and distal pulses every hour.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.709
Really? That's it?

35:18.710 --> 35:19.879
Nothing else to say?

35:19.880 --> 35:22.879
What? Oh, you want praise?

35:22.880 --> 35:25.619
Um, good work, Dr. DeLuca.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.169
You did your job.

35:27.170 --> 35:28.709
You let someone who wasn't ready

35:28.710 --> 35:30.789
do the most critical part
of his surgery.

35:30.790 --> 35:32.879
I should have been doing that
anastomosis from the beginning.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.209
But instead, you sidelined me

35:35.210 --> 35:36.999
because of my relationship
with Meredith Grey.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.119
Excuse me?

35:39.120 --> 35:41.619
I aced that skills lab, Bailey.

35:41.620 --> 35:43.499
My suture technique
was far more advanced...

35:43.500 --> 35:45.289
Helm needed the practice!

35:45.290 --> 35:47.749
She needed the adrenaline
and the fear because all of that

35:47.750 --> 35:49.209
is what makes you a surgeon!

35:49.210 --> 35:50.879
And don't you dare question
my methods!

35:50.880 --> 35:54.619
This is not personal, DeLuca!
Unless you make it personal.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.669
If I were you, I'd start
thinking about my career

35:57.670 --> 36:00.380
and let go
of certain... loyalties.

36:07.790 --> 36:10.039
Dr. Lawson, extension 2290.

36:10.040 --> 36:11.579
Dr. Lawson, extension 2290.

36:11.580 --> 36:13.879
Dr. Bailey?
Hi, um, can you talk?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.209
Is now a bad time?

36:15.210 --> 36:18.289
I no longer have good times.
What?

36:18.290 --> 36:22.079
I've taken the day,
and I've made my decision.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.079
I want to be a general
surgery attending.

36:25.080 --> 36:27.039
I don't recall
giving you that option.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.119
Did Tom Koracick... No one did.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.249
Well, no one here did.

36:32.250 --> 36:33.789
So, you're going to Pac-North?

36:33.790 --> 36:35.249
That's up to you.

36:35.250 --> 36:36.669
They've made me
a tempting offer.

36:36.670 --> 36:37.749
Your husband.

36:37.750 --> 36:39.499
Their chief.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.749
They believe that I'm ready.

36:40.750 --> 36:42.669
I've trained under the best,
and most of whom

36:42.670 --> 36:44.249
no longer work here.

36:44.250 --> 36:46.919
I know how this place works.
I know how you work.

36:46.920 --> 36:48.289
And I'm ready.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.459
I would be an asset
to any hospital.

36:50.460 --> 36:54.380
The question is... do you want
that hospital to be yours?

37:04.880 --> 37:06.540
Let's go to my office.

37:07.460 --> 37:08.500
Yes.

37:16.500 --> 37:20.880
Uh, hey.
I wanted to apologize for the...

37:23.880 --> 37:26.539
I'm sorry, Tom,
for the incident.

37:26.540 --> 37:27.879
Incident? Yeah.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.579
You deep-fried my nads.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.499
It was
an unfortunate accident, Tom,

37:32.500 --> 37:35.619
and I am very sorry, so...

37:35.620 --> 37:38.620
Actually, champ, I'm gonna need
you to step back a few feet.

37:39.710 --> 37:42.919
500 feet, if we're gonna be
sticklers about it.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.749
Court orders. What?

37:44.750 --> 37:47.499
I've obtained an emergency
restraining order against you,

37:47.500 --> 37:49.789
Hunt, due to acute emotional
and physical distress.

37:49.790 --> 37:52.419
Restraining order?
If you need any clarification,

37:52.420 --> 37:55.419
feel free to reach out
to my attorney, Ron Brickman.

37:55.420 --> 37:56.999
He can answer
any questions you have.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.379
He's a good friend, hell
of a tennis player, actually.

37:59.380 --> 38:01.789
Tom, we work together.

38:01.790 --> 38:05.619
Shut the door on your way out,
would you?

38:05.620 --> 38:08.080
Ohh.

38:14.670 --> 38:15.710
Ahh.

38:18.250 --> 38:21.289
Which is just a long-winded
way of saying thank you

38:21.290 --> 38:23.669
for the offer,
but I'm afraid I have to pass.

38:23.670 --> 38:26.459
Wait. You took my offer
to Bailey to get a better one?

38:26.460 --> 38:29.829
It didn't feel that calculated
in the moment, but basically.

38:29.830 --> 38:32.119
I feel used.
I know! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.619
But it's the smart choice.
The facility's better.

38:34.620 --> 38:37.379
The tech is cutting-edge.
Higher-profile patients.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.459
Look,
you're making it sound like

38:38.460 --> 38:40.119
I'm the chief of a burger joint.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.329
Someone died
in your waiting room.

38:41.330 --> 38:42.749
Nobody died.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.379
Webber and I got to him in time.
He's fine.

38:44.380 --> 38:45.579
Okay, you're basically making

38:45.580 --> 38:47.669
my argument for me.

38:47.670 --> 38:49.419
Alright, just make sure
you get a parking spot.

38:49.420 --> 38:52.999
Bailey's really tight with them,
so demand one.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.539
She gave me yours.

38:55.540 --> 38:58.120
After we've been sick or hurt,
our bodies remember.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.750
So, he had them in... His nuts?!

39:03.500 --> 39:06.880
Look, it's only funny
because he's okay. Yep!

39:11.920 --> 39:13.829
Basically, the more we go
through something,

39:13.830 --> 39:15.710
the better we can handle it
if it happens again.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.580
Hi! Hey.

39:31.210 --> 39:33.330
Now, I heard a rumor you were
at the hospital today.

39:39.290 --> 39:41.920
I actually have stumbled across.

39:44.330 --> 39:46.119
I know I got fired
for trying to help a kid

39:46.120 --> 39:47.669
who fell through the cracks.

39:47.670 --> 39:50.829
And as much as I try to keep
my head down and lay low

39:50.830 --> 39:54.789
and just get through my hours,
I keep coming across people

39:54.790 --> 39:58.619
who can't get the help they need
because of the same crap.

39:58.620 --> 40:00.499
They keep falling
through the same cracks.

40:00.500 --> 40:03.169
Okay, look, before you decide to
do whatever it is you're doing,

40:03.170 --> 40:05.619
okay, jail sucks. It's not fun.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.829
You're not gonna be able to see
your kids or pee in private.

40:07.830 --> 40:09.209
The water tastes like feet.
Should I go on?

40:09.210 --> 40:11.329
Okay, I'm not planning
on going to jail.

40:11.330 --> 40:13.650
But what I'm planning to do
is write about what I'm seeing.

40:14.790 --> 40:17.210
I do. You're about to
face the medical board.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.879
Didn't the lawyer
say to lay low?

40:19.880 --> 40:22.040
Yes, but I-I-I don't think
I'm capable of that.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.290
What?

40:31.540 --> 40:33.209
Nothing. Nothing.

40:33.210 --> 40:36.209
You're just very, very sexy

40:36.210 --> 40:37.789
when you're about to burn
your whole life down.

40:37.790 --> 40:39.419
You know that?

40:39.420 --> 40:42.169
Our bodies are prepared
to bounce back.

40:42.170 --> 40:44.500
Or so we think.

40:58.120 --> 41:01.920
Did I... say the wrong thing?

41:13.500 --> 41:16.170
Of what happened with
Christopher, and, um...

41:17.830 --> 41:19.460
of doing this alone.

41:27.750 --> 41:29.540
I was scared.

41:44.750 --> 41:46.330
It's probably just the hormones.

41:48.250 --> 41:49.250
Probably.

41:49.251 --> 41:51.580
- Please don't say it back.
- Okay.

42:02.460 --> 42:03.960
And now I kinda want
to meet that kid.

42:05.290 --> 42:08.210
Well...

42:09.670 --> 42:12.080
Sometimes an unknown
throws the whole thing off.
