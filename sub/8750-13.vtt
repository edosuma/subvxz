Subs created by: David Coleman.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.573
She was lost and scared.

00:08.707 --> 00:10.545
I'll hear my name being called.

00:10.546 --> 00:12.629
I got grabbed.

00:12.630 --> 00:15.358
Her head's, like, just..

00:15.359 --> 00:17.572
If you came under her
spell, you did what she said.

00:17.573 --> 00:19.420
These people were absolutely terrified

00:19.421 --> 00:20.421
and desperate to get out.

00:20.422 --> 00:22.093
And she was up there.

00:22.094 --> 00:24.240
- It's a horrible death.
- Not a good way to die.

00:24.241 --> 00:25.829
I can't help you unless
you tell me the truth.

00:25.830 --> 00:29.060
They're collecting the dead.

00:29.061 --> 00:32.601
Oh, my God, it's so awful.

00:34.225 --> 00:36.191
There's something down there.

00:36.192 --> 00:39.312
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.123 --> 00:42.376
A lot of dead people are here.

00:42.377 --> 00:43.627
I see dead people.

00:43.628 --> 00:45.333
This is not good.

00:45.334 --> 00:47.381
I speak to dead people..

00:47.382 --> 00:49.027
He is very pissed off.

00:49.028 --> 00:50.551
And they speak to me..

00:50.552 --> 00:51.969
The house is angry.

00:51.970 --> 00:55.396
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:55.397 --> 00:57.167
He's killed people.

00:57.168 --> 00:58.726
I rely on my partner.

00:58.727 --> 01:00.076
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:00.077 --> 01:02.179
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective..

01:02.180 --> 01:03.568
He got shot at his house?

01:03.569 --> 01:06.521
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

01:06.522 --> 01:07.873
Aren't you terrified, being here?

01:07.874 --> 01:09.337
It's my job to reveal 'em.

01:09.338 --> 01:11.424
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist".

01:11.425 --> 01:13.422
But Steve and I never speak..

01:13.423 --> 01:15.492
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.493 --> 01:16.761
Until the very end.

01:16.762 --> 01:18.162
It's bad.

01:18.163 --> 01:20.297
And we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:20.298 --> 01:21.631
I'd like some answers.

01:21.632 --> 01:24.632
Or time to get out.

01:47.581 --> 01:51.766
Amy and I never cross paths
during our investigations.

01:51.767 --> 01:57.511
I focus on research, interview witnesses,
and uncover secrets from the past.

02:05.502 --> 02:09.213
I'm in Olalla, Washington,
about an hour out of Seattle.

02:09.214 --> 02:11.749
I'm headed over to meet
a teenager named Logan.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.451
He says there's a lot of strange
stuff going on in this house,

02:14.452 --> 02:16.953
and he thinks his family's in danger.

02:16.954 --> 02:18.355
He sounds pretty shaken up,

02:18.356 --> 02:23.936
so we're gonna see if we
can figure this out for him.

02:41.145 --> 02:42.914
Before Amy enters a location,

02:42.915 --> 02:48.785
I have to clear the area of anything
that could influence her findings.

02:48.786 --> 02:52.691
This home has a lot
of family photographs,

02:52.692 --> 02:58.592
so it's important that I take my
time to cover or remove them all.

03:33.263 --> 03:37.463
There's this lady who wanders around.

03:43.965 --> 03:49.065
Her face and all her
teeth are, like, bashed in.

03:49.413 --> 03:52.593
Oh, it's such a mess.

03:52.617 --> 03:56.440
Like, it's all nasty
and bloody and, like..

03:56.441 --> 03:58.841
It's awful.

04:19.387 --> 04:21.522
So, Logan, it's rare
that Amy and I get called

04:21.523 --> 04:23.378
in by somebody so
young. How old are you?

04:23.379 --> 04:24.375
I'm 18.

04:24.376 --> 04:27.581
Okay. Um, what's going on that you
need us to come in and investigate?

04:27.582 --> 04:30.314
Well, I've heard whispering,
and I've been seeing things

04:30.315 --> 04:33.924
since I've been young and lived
here, over in the other house.

04:33.925 --> 04:36.326
Okay, so that other house
I passed when I drove up

04:36.327 --> 04:38.438
- is.. You used to live there?
- Yes.

04:38.439 --> 04:41.478
I had some friends over, and we went
to the other house and did a séance,

04:41.479 --> 04:45.986
and we tried to communicate with the
spirits and kind of talk to 'em, but..

04:45.987 --> 04:48.289
I'm afraid that I set
something in motion

04:48.290 --> 04:50.317
that I don't understand,
and I called you guys here

04:50.318 --> 04:52.294
because I'm hoping you
can put a stop to it.

04:52.295 --> 04:54.754
Okay, is there anyplace in this
house you can show me in particular?

04:54.755 --> 04:58.955
Downstairs, if you want to follow me.

05:06.574 --> 05:09.644
This is where I hear
a lot of the whispers.

05:09.645 --> 05:11.512
Okay, explain the whispers to me.

05:11.513 --> 05:13.748
The whispers sound
like a crowd of people.

05:13.749 --> 05:15.515
It sounds like it's really up close,

05:15.516 --> 05:17.386
and they're all trying
to talk to you at once,

05:17.387 --> 05:20.010
and then sometimes, while I'm
laying here trying to sleep,

05:20.011 --> 05:23.413
I'll hear my name being called.

05:23.414 --> 05:25.382
- So does it keep you up?
- Yes.

05:25.383 --> 05:28.623
It just goes all night.

05:43.801 --> 05:49.701
There's a lot of yelling, and I also
see a lot of bodies on the ground.

05:50.928 --> 05:54.528
I feel like a lot of death.

05:56.847 --> 06:01.584
Dead people are attracted
here and kept here.

06:01.585 --> 06:06.256
This person gets fixated,
like a collector gets..

06:06.257 --> 06:11.237
It's kind of like they're
collecting the dead.

06:17.201 --> 06:19.342
So, Logan, this is the
house you used to live in?

06:19.343 --> 06:21.203
Yes.

06:21.445 --> 06:24.374
This is the room where I did the séance.

06:24.375 --> 06:25.615
What'd you guys do?

06:25.616 --> 06:27.978
For our séance, I had a
couple of my friends over,

06:27.979 --> 06:30.914
and we.. We came in here
and just sat in a circle,

06:30.915 --> 06:33.450
and it was night, so it was
really dark. We couldn't see.

06:33.451 --> 06:36.325
We started asking questions
and tried to communicate

06:36.326 --> 06:39.037
with the spirits and see if we
could get some sort of a response.

06:39.038 --> 06:40.090
Anything happen?

06:40.091 --> 06:42.867
We got scratching on the
floor. We heard footsteps.

06:42.868 --> 06:44.594
One of my friends had gotten shaken.

06:44.595 --> 06:45.886
What happened?

06:45.887 --> 06:47.729
She shook and just fell to the ground,

06:47.730 --> 06:49.371
and she was crying, and we
were trying to figure out

06:49.372 --> 06:50.682
what happened to her, and just..

06:50.683 --> 06:52.936
She said that she had
gotten shaken from behind.

06:52.937 --> 06:55.601
And there was nobody else around to
do that, like, to play a joke on her?

06:55.602 --> 06:56.515
No.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.555
And this was the first
time you did a séance?

06:58.556 --> 06:59.737
Yes.

06:59.738 --> 07:02.618
- You sure?
- Yes.

07:03.541 --> 07:05.849
I did have a couple
more after that, though.

07:05.850 --> 07:08.051
How many more?

07:08.052 --> 07:11.536
I kind of lost track. I think I did ten.

07:11.537 --> 07:13.823
As a former NYPD Detective,

07:13.824 --> 07:17.177
I can tell when a witness
is withholding information.

07:17.178 --> 07:19.729
So, Logan, let me get
this straight. You did ten?

07:19.730 --> 07:22.540
Somewhere around 10, 15 séances.

07:22.541 --> 07:24.938
Logan, you told me you did one séance.

07:24.939 --> 07:26.514
Then you told me you did ten.

07:26.515 --> 07:28.516
Now I got you to tell me you did 15.

07:28.517 --> 07:30.885
I can't help you unless
you tell me the truth.

07:30.886 --> 07:34.006
So what's the number?

07:35.704 --> 07:37.892
I've done 17 séances.

07:37.893 --> 07:39.961
- You're sure about that?
- Yes.

07:39.962 --> 07:42.797
You might have bit off
more than you could chew.

07:42.798 --> 07:47.658
- You understand that, right?
- I do now, yes.

07:52.455 --> 07:55.176
You said someone is collecting the dead.

07:55.177 --> 07:57.278
How would they do that?

07:57.279 --> 07:59.373
I think that.. That if they are,

07:59.374 --> 08:04.115
then it'd probably be, like,
some form of communications..

08:04.116 --> 08:08.856
And this is inadvertently
holding them there.

08:11.537 --> 08:14.774
This is the (Bleep) that
(Bleep) pisses me off.

08:14.775 --> 08:17.885
I get very angry when the
living communicate with the dead

08:17.886 --> 08:21.126
for their own amusement.

08:21.391 --> 08:24.511
How do you like that?

08:24.947 --> 08:26.814
You like that, huh?

08:26.815 --> 08:29.134
Oh, why don't you talk to
me, why don't you talk to me?

08:29.135 --> 08:30.984
Come on in. Talk to me.

08:30.985 --> 08:34.153
I feel like someone is
tormenting the dead here

08:34.154 --> 08:38.534
and the dead are trapped because of it.

08:39.359 --> 08:43.919
Bad. I get very angry
about this (Bleep).

08:44.174 --> 08:47.455
I'm just (Bleep) sick
of it. I'm disgusted.

08:47.456 --> 08:49.676
Disgusted.

08:51.604 --> 08:54.964
It's not a (Bleep) game.

08:58.369 --> 09:02.749
They should just tear this (Bleep) down.

09:08.128 --> 09:12.508
They should just tear this (Bleep) down.

09:17.007 --> 09:19.218
- That's what they should do.
- Why?

09:19.219 --> 09:23.556
Because this is like a
place for dead squatters,

09:23.557 --> 09:27.667
and this is inadvertently
holding them there.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.696
So it's trapping them?

09:30.697 --> 09:34.117
Yeah, but it's not just..

09:35.701 --> 09:37.981
The house.

09:38.371 --> 09:42.511
The living people are doing it, too.

09:55.341 --> 09:57.814
So, Shane, I spoke to Logan,
and, um, I was wondering,

09:57.815 --> 09:59.546
have you had any experiences here?

09:59.547 --> 10:03.008
I never did, no. I really haven't
experienced anything out here.

10:03.009 --> 10:05.426
- Do you believe Logan and his friends?
- I do.

10:05.427 --> 10:07.818
You can tell, when something
happens, they're upset about it.

10:07.819 --> 10:10.425
- Okay.
- You know, and it.. It affects them.

10:10.426 --> 10:11.935
All right, so you don't think
they're making any of this up?

10:11.936 --> 10:13.685
- No, no.
- Okay.

10:13.686 --> 10:16.290
What do you know about the property?

10:16.291 --> 10:19.888
We've heard that, uh, that
there was a Dr. Hazzard

10:19.889 --> 10:22.873
that set up shop out here,
and that she had, uh, done

10:22.874 --> 10:27.074
some pretty terrible things to people.

10:41.152 --> 10:44.929
Uh, there's these, like, victims.

10:44.930 --> 10:48.227
Uh, victims of.. Of terrible people.

10:48.228 --> 10:52.564
And then, like, back here, there's,
like, this space that's, like..

10:52.565 --> 10:58.145
Like, for.. For the bad people
who, like, killed people.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.406
It's awful.

11:14.053 --> 11:16.143
So did you build this
place or did somebody else?

11:16.144 --> 11:17.903
My wife and I built this house,

11:17.904 --> 11:20.887
and we wanted to incorporate
some of the old house into it,

11:20.888 --> 11:24.157
and so we took pieces like
the bannister from next door

11:24.158 --> 11:29.095
and brought it all over here as
one unit to put in the new house.

11:29.096 --> 11:32.933
Did Logan stop having
experiences when you guys moved?

11:32.934 --> 11:37.184
At first, nothing really
happened, but as time went on,

11:37.185 --> 11:39.639
it seems like more events have occurred.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.347
Shane, I gotta ask you, as a Father
myself, I mean, how do you feel

11:42.348 --> 11:45.344
about what Logan did as
far as the séances go?

11:45.345 --> 11:47.773
All right, you know he did 17?

11:47.774 --> 11:51.322
I had no idea that it was that many.

11:51.323 --> 11:53.119
How do you feel about the paranormal?

11:53.120 --> 11:55.565
You know, I'm a skeptic, but certainly,

11:55.566 --> 12:01.026
there's something going on
that's affecting my family.

12:02.762 --> 12:06.662
There's, like, somebody screaming.

12:08.022 --> 12:09.703
- Male or female?
- Female.

12:09.704 --> 12:13.139
She's screaming, and
there's, like, chaos.

12:13.140 --> 12:17.100
Aah! What the (Bleep)'s going on?

12:19.778 --> 12:21.347
It's, like, so much pain.

12:21.348 --> 12:24.183
It's so much pain. It's
so much (Bleep) pain.

12:24.184 --> 12:25.952
What is?

12:25.953 --> 12:28.293
This dying.

12:32.633 --> 12:36.573
And I'm hearing crackle,
pop, crackle, pop,

12:36.574 --> 12:40.894
and then it.. Her head's, like, just..

12:44.537 --> 12:48.377
She's going higher to get away.

13:03.556 --> 13:06.196
She fell down..

13:06.994 --> 13:10.294
And broke her face open.

13:11.430 --> 13:17.330
She does the face thing, like, her
face is all busted and bloody and nasty.

13:31.406 --> 13:33.619
And she was up there.

13:33.620 --> 13:38.060
She goes in and out of the wall a lot.

13:45.732 --> 13:47.884
So, Lori, I spoke with
your husband and Logan.

13:47.885 --> 13:51.975
Logan, in particular, seems to think
he might have stirred some things up

13:51.976 --> 13:54.083
- that might not be so good.
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.691
Sometimes he does feel that way,

13:55.692 --> 14:01.081
and when he's got a whole group of..
Of teenagers together, they get scared.

14:01.082 --> 14:03.516
Now one of his friends, he told me,

14:03.517 --> 14:05.578
uh, had an incident where she got..

14:05.579 --> 14:06.586
- Touched.
- Mm-hmm.

14:06.587 --> 14:11.384
Yeah, that did concern me, and
so I told him that maybe he was

14:11.385 --> 14:15.028
bothering spirits or ghosts, and
maybe he should stop doing that.

14:15.029 --> 14:16.896
What about you? Have you seen anything?

14:16.897 --> 14:18.965
I have had experiences, yeah.

14:18.966 --> 14:21.434
Okay, so do you think anything
here could cause you guys any harm?

14:21.435 --> 14:26.775
I think the boys think
that sometimes, but I don't.

14:50.986 --> 14:56.886
The dead lady from the other house,
who likes to show her blood and gore..

14:57.875 --> 15:00.220
She does have a plan.

15:00.221 --> 15:04.721
Her plan is, make her jump or fall down.

15:06.027 --> 15:09.496
The angry woman with the
broken face is out for blood.

15:09.497 --> 15:12.887
I think she's plotting against
a woman who lives in this house.

15:12.888 --> 15:15.348
Serious, uh..

15:18.305 --> 15:23.519
I don't know how she exactly
wants to execute this plan.

15:23.520 --> 15:28.507
I think she wants to do her the
same way that she did herself.

15:28.508 --> 15:30.959
Make the.. The living person..

15:30.960 --> 15:33.540
F.. Fall down.

15:39.518 --> 15:41.320
Why? Why does she want to do that?

15:41.321 --> 15:47.221
She feels that this living
person is her obstacle to leaving.

15:48.288 --> 15:50.243
Is she right?

15:50.244 --> 15:52.104
Yes.

15:52.926 --> 15:56.166
This is a freaking war.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.281
Both Logan and his Mom Lori

16:07.282 --> 16:09.710
mentioned a girl who had a
pretty frightening experience

16:09.711 --> 16:13.191
during one of the séances..

16:14.016 --> 16:19.916
So I'm going to meet with her and get
a firsthand account of what went down.

16:27.860 --> 16:30.398
Logan was telling me you
attended a séance with him.

16:30.399 --> 16:31.898
Yeah.

16:31.899 --> 16:35.653
He has friends come over every once in
awhile, and we turn off all the lights

16:35.654 --> 16:39.407
and we wait until we hear something.

16:39.408 --> 16:40.722
All right, but something
happened one night.

16:40.723 --> 16:43.400
Oh, yeah. I got grabbed in my back.

16:43.401 --> 16:46.429
Immediately, I blacked
out and fell to the ground

16:46.430 --> 16:49.556
and almost hit one of the kids
who was laying on the ground.

16:49.557 --> 16:52.441
They all picked me up.
I don't remember walking.

16:52.442 --> 16:54.370
I think they all carried me outside.

16:54.371 --> 16:56.030
Somebody wasn't playing
a joke, I hope.

16:56.031 --> 17:00.559
No. There was no one
behind me at all.

17:12.828 --> 17:15.904
Getting pushed. I'm getting pushed.

17:15.905 --> 17:18.194
It hurts, it hurts.

17:18.194 --> 17:19.290
I'm getting..

17:19.290 --> 17:22.171
Shoved in my back.

17:29.433 --> 17:30.907
Logan's done a lot of séances there.

17:30.908 --> 17:33.457
Do you think he's playing with fire?

17:33.458 --> 17:34.894
Yeah.

17:34.895 --> 17:37.057
The mood changes every time we go there.

17:37.058 --> 17:39.093
Some days, it's very, very dark

17:39.094 --> 17:41.830
and you can feel it's heavy
the moment you walk in.

17:41.831 --> 17:45.636
You're sad and you..
You don't feel hope.

17:45.637 --> 17:48.969
- Would you ever go back there?
- No, never.

17:48.970 --> 17:50.770
Ok.

17:53.609 --> 17:57.929
- Careful, careful, careful.
- Oh, jeez.

17:59.516 --> 18:01.748
Weird, I thought this went further back.

18:01.749 --> 18:03.061
I'm seeing a room here.

18:03.062 --> 18:06.945
It's kind of feeling like it might
be, like, a doorway, like, a vortex.

18:06.946 --> 18:08.866
Okay.

18:10.225 --> 18:12.895
Whoever's been attempting
to contact the dead here

18:12.896 --> 18:16.053
may have opened a
gateway to the other side,

18:16.054 --> 18:18.634
and this can be very dangerous.

18:18.635 --> 18:21.685
It's drawing more, um..

18:21.686 --> 18:23.906
Bad, uh..

18:24.783 --> 18:27.183
Dead people.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.632
Shane mentioned a Dr. Hazzard

18:37.633 --> 18:42.853
who did terrible things
to people on his property..

18:42.925 --> 18:45.371
So I'm going back to his house
to meet with a local author

18:45.372 --> 18:50.172
who says he's gonna
give me the real story.

18:53.335 --> 18:57.175
This place was known
as starvation heights.

18:57.176 --> 19:00.141
Dr. Linda Burfield Hazzard
lived here about a century ago.

19:00.142 --> 19:04.312
She had this theory that
if she could fast you down,

19:04.313 --> 19:06.515
that's taking you
down to skin and bones,

19:06.516 --> 19:08.984
she could then build you
back up to perfect health.

19:08.985 --> 19:13.065
Basically, uh, she was starving you.

19:15.803 --> 19:18.596
Did she, like, feed them at first, and
then just cut 'em off? How'd she do it?

19:18.597 --> 19:23.180
She started them on this fast immediately,
which was asparagus broth, water.

19:23.181 --> 19:27.203
They didn't get any
food for about 40 days.

19:27.204 --> 19:30.138
Lots of people died here, and a
lot of people tried to get away.

19:30.139 --> 19:32.841
I mean, people that lived
in Olalla at the time

19:32.842 --> 19:34.810
talked about seeing
these starving people..

19:34.811 --> 19:36.378
They called 'em skeletons..

19:36.379 --> 19:39.019
That were walking
out, um, into the woods

19:39.020 --> 19:40.672
or to a neighbor's
house to try to get food.

19:40.673 --> 19:42.787
I mean, these people that came here

19:42.788 --> 19:45.857
were absolutely terrified
and desperate to get out.

19:45.858 --> 19:48.794
Okay, so how many people
wound up dying under her care?

19:48.795 --> 19:51.675
Between 20 and 40.

20:00.126 --> 20:04.940
There's just too many people here that
are just straight up in their death state.

20:04.941 --> 20:08.276
When someone dies in a
traumatic or violent way,

20:08.277 --> 20:11.279
they can be trapped in
what's called the death state.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.082
It's too much (Bleep) pain.

20:14.083 --> 20:17.683
A lot of pain, these people.

20:24.699 --> 20:28.645
So, Gregg, what did
Dr. Hazzard do up here?

20:28.646 --> 20:30.511
There's three things to her treatment.

20:30.512 --> 20:35.737
The fast, she's doing a massage so
vigorous that it hurts you, okay?

20:35.738 --> 20:38.581
You're getting pummeled, and
the last thing is the enema.

20:38.582 --> 20:42.641
She's giving you an enema that's
gonna last you eight hours.

20:42.642 --> 20:45.131
Is this where she kept patients?

20:45.132 --> 20:48.937
This bedroom up here is where she
kept her two most famous patients.

20:48.938 --> 20:51.787
Claire and Dora Williamson were
these spinsters from England

20:51.788 --> 20:54.589
that had a lot of money, so
they came here for the treatment.

20:54.590 --> 20:56.191
Okay, so what would wind up happening?

20:56.192 --> 21:00.842
One was able to smuggle out a cable
through a staff person or somebody

21:00.843 --> 21:04.119
to get their nurse from when
they grew up to rescue them.

21:04.120 --> 21:06.468
- Somebody finally came?
- Somebody came, but they came too late.

21:06.469 --> 21:08.535
- Claire had already died.
- Okay.

21:08.536 --> 21:11.306
That's how they were able to
try Dr. Hazzard for murder.

21:11.307 --> 21:13.909
- What did she do with the sister's body?
- She did the autopsy here.

21:13.910 --> 21:17.267
She marked down that Claire had
died of cirrhosis of the liver,

21:17.268 --> 21:22.391
like she did on a lot of cases, and then
she shipped her over on a private boat

21:22.392 --> 21:24.776
over to Seattle, to the mortuary.

21:24.777 --> 21:28.977
Here's what Dora looked like before..

21:30.766 --> 21:33.213
And here's what she looked like
by the time she was rescued.

21:33.214 --> 21:34.067
Oh, my God.

21:34.068 --> 21:37.188
She weighed 38 pounds.

21:38.389 --> 21:42.894
Dora talked about how Dr. Hazzard
suggested that she kill herself,

21:42.895 --> 21:46.326
so there's also the idea that maybe
she hastened a few people to the grave

21:46.327 --> 21:49.387
by suggesting suicide.

21:53.271 --> 21:57.275
Where's the woman who
fell down the stairs?

21:57.276 --> 22:00.447
She, like, walks back and
forth and back and forth.

22:00.448 --> 22:05.669
She comes all the way over,
and then she just.. Pfft.

22:05.670 --> 22:08.550
She felt pressured.

22:08.653 --> 22:11.653
She felt intimidated.

22:11.723 --> 22:14.658
She might have jumped off the stairs.

22:14.659 --> 22:16.254
She was..

22:16.255 --> 22:18.705
Lost and scared and..

22:18.706 --> 22:21.226
Confused and..

22:23.189 --> 22:26.129
She jumped because..

22:27.242 --> 22:31.322
Somebody was gonna kill her anyways.

22:37.688 --> 22:40.487
I'm heading over to the old
funeral parlor in Seattle

22:40.488 --> 22:43.420
where this quack Doctor
took her dead patients.

22:43.421 --> 22:46.300
I'm meeting with a forensic pathologist
to find out what kind of suffering

22:46.301 --> 22:51.881
these poor people went through
as they starved to death.

23:01.153 --> 23:03.322
So, Doc, what is this place?

23:03.323 --> 23:05.891
We're in what was the
original funeral parlor

23:05.892 --> 23:11.352
where Linda Hazzard would
bring the bodies from Olalla.

23:13.566 --> 23:16.249
Now she had patients that
eventually starved to death.

23:16.250 --> 23:17.531
I don't know a lot about starvation.

23:17.532 --> 23:19.049
I didn't deal with it
a lot as a Detective.

23:19.050 --> 23:21.084
I was hoping you could take me
through what a body would go through

23:21.085 --> 23:22.146
when they're starved to death.

23:22.147 --> 23:26.796
The first phase is kind of where you
become disoriented, delirious, weak.

23:26.797 --> 23:31.183
You may actually have to hold onto a
wall while you're walking up stairs.

23:31.184 --> 23:36.864
The second phase is going to be your
heart rate is gonna drop dramatically.

23:36.865 --> 23:39.166
As things progress, there is a point

23:39.167 --> 23:44.567
where your organs are actually
cannibalizing themselves.

23:44.938 --> 23:48.409
Man, this is some kind of pain.

23:48.410 --> 23:50.919
I feel like I'm gonna explode,

23:50.920 --> 23:54.641
like your head and your face and chest

23:54.642 --> 23:56.896
are going to explode.

23:56.897 --> 23:59.697
Your heart weight can actually
decrease by a third of its weight.

23:59.698 --> 24:02.165
Your liver can decrease by half.

24:02.166 --> 24:05.584
I feel like my ribs are
collapsing, or my lungs.

24:05.585 --> 24:07.060
Oh, my God, it hurts.

24:07.061 --> 24:10.870
The muscles between your
ribs and your diaphragm..

24:10.871 --> 24:13.691
They're shrinking.

24:13.926 --> 24:16.063
Well, there's this pressure..

24:16.064 --> 24:20.216
Aah! You know, and then he's
fighting to breathe, to live.

24:20.217 --> 24:25.178
In the end, you actually asphyxiate,
because those muscles just stop working.

24:25.179 --> 24:28.839
Just feels like I'm drowning.

24:28.945 --> 24:32.151
This pain is running
through me everywhere.

24:32.152 --> 24:34.547
I've never felt anything like it..

24:34.548 --> 24:39.228
Almost like drowning,
but without the water.

24:43.138 --> 24:46.918
From here up, it's just like..

24:47.944 --> 24:53.044
And it hurts so (Bleep)
bad. It hurts, it hurts.

24:54.450 --> 24:59.187
People will actually, um, let out
these primitive, uttural screams.

24:59.188 --> 25:02.224
Just the act of breathing
becomes a tremendous effort.

25:02.225 --> 25:05.405
It's a horrible death.

25:05.437 --> 25:08.692
I don't think that's the
way I would want to die.

25:08.693 --> 25:11.933
That was really, really horrible.

25:11.934 --> 25:15.529
Definitely not a good way to die.

25:15.530 --> 25:18.650
Why did they do this?

25:21.810 --> 25:25.881
Linda Hazzard was obviously
a sick woman by any standards.

25:25.882 --> 25:28.651
Her treatments were
unscientific torture sessions

25:28.652 --> 25:30.819
where dozens of people died in agony.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.822
I need to know what happened
to her once she got arrested.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.325
I'm meeting with a legal expert
who's familiar with the case

25:36.326 --> 25:39.746
to find out what happened.

25:45.182 --> 25:47.503
Linda Hazzard was charged
with first-degree murder

25:47.504 --> 25:50.890
by the Kitsap County,
um, District Attorney.

25:50.891 --> 25:54.581
She was a very strong woman who could
control and influence anyone around her.

25:54.582 --> 25:57.970
If you came under her
spell, you did what she said.

25:57.971 --> 25:59.948
So, Ron, she's charged
with first-degree murder

25:59.949 --> 26:01.817
and she goes to trial. What happened?

26:01.818 --> 26:05.220
Uh, the jury convicted her
of second-degree murder,

26:05.221 --> 26:07.996
and the reason they couldn't
find her guilty of first degree

26:07.997 --> 26:11.427
is the jury did not find
that it was premeditated.

26:11.428 --> 26:13.895
Linda Hazzard was ultimately
pardoned by the governor

26:13.896 --> 26:15.864
on a deal that she
had to leave the state.

26:15.865 --> 26:20.221
Theoretically, she wasn't supposed to have
patients any more, but she came back here,

26:20.222 --> 26:22.663
started a health school of some kind.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.873
She sets up shop again, basically,

26:24.874 --> 26:27.498
- and nobody says nothing?
- It was in the wilderness, okay?

26:27.499 --> 26:29.869
No one knows what's going on
there, but several people died

26:29.870 --> 26:32.103
over the next, uh, decade or so.

26:32.104 --> 26:34.088
And she was never brought
to trial again for anything?

26:34.089 --> 26:35.083
Never charged.

26:35.084 --> 26:37.609
- What ended up happening to her?
- That's kind of ironic.

26:37.610 --> 26:39.830
In 1938..

26:39.955 --> 26:44.006
She, uh, died of her own treatment.

26:44.007 --> 26:46.161
Was that the cause of death
for her? Was it starvation?

26:46.162 --> 26:48.802
Starvation, yes.

26:57.005 --> 27:00.158
I'm having a little bit of a hard time..

27:00.159 --> 27:03.706
Wanting to connect with this person.

27:03.707 --> 27:07.376
Their body feels small to
me, smallish, like, fragile,

27:07.377 --> 27:11.157
like, small-boned, like, small..

27:11.163 --> 27:13.327
Like a small frame.

27:13.328 --> 27:16.568
(Bleep) this hurts, man.

27:16.883 --> 27:20.423
Oh, my God, it's so awful.

27:27.603 --> 27:30.272
I would like to sketch
a lady that I met.

27:30.273 --> 27:33.552
She is very, very angry.

27:33.553 --> 27:38.173
- Depressed, and in a lot of pain.
- Okay.

27:40.972 --> 27:44.332
How about under the eyes?

27:45.109 --> 27:47.693
A little, like, fuller and rounder.

27:47.694 --> 27:51.654
- Lower lip, very thin?
- Mm-hmm.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.902
And how about her neck?

27:56.903 --> 28:00.083
It was short and thin.

28:04.091 --> 28:07.631
Is this the person you saw?

28:07.814 --> 28:09.674
Yes.

28:29.083 --> 28:31.835
After completing each of our
investigations separately,

28:31.836 --> 28:36.038
Amy and I are meeting in the house
where Linda Hazzard kept her victims.

28:36.039 --> 28:38.341
Here, we'll reveal our
findings to our clients

28:38.342 --> 28:40.929
and each other for the first time.

28:40.930 --> 28:45.782
Logan is 18 years old, and he's been
having some weird encounters here.

28:45.783 --> 28:47.984
This is Logan's Dad, Shane.

28:47.985 --> 28:49.552
Hi, nice to meet you.

28:49.553 --> 28:55.453
So with that, Amy, can you tell
us a little bit about your walk?

28:56.911 --> 29:00.296
One of the initial things that I got was

29:00.297 --> 29:04.834
there are a lot of dead people
in this house, in a lot of pain.

29:04.835 --> 29:10.115
A lot of victims were,
like, touching base with me.

29:11.165 --> 29:15.202
And I was looking at the
house, and it reminded me of

29:15.203 --> 29:19.114
when homeless living people
will squat at a location.

29:19.115 --> 29:22.318
This is, like, a place
for dead squatters,

29:22.319 --> 29:24.888
and this is inadvertently
holding them there.

29:24.889 --> 29:28.246
They should just tear this (Bleep) down.

29:28.247 --> 29:31.193
- You.. You got that all here?
- Yes.

29:31.194 --> 29:36.553
Do me a favor. Logan, explain
to her what you hear at night.

29:36.554 --> 29:37.466
Yes.

29:37.467 --> 29:41.004
Um, down in my room, as
well as over in this house,

29:41.005 --> 29:43.940
it sounds like there's
a group of people,

29:43.941 --> 29:47.109
and they're all trying to
say something at one time,

29:47.110 --> 29:52.381
and I can't make out what they're saying
because they're all talking at once.

29:52.382 --> 29:55.117
You guys know some of the history here.

29:55.118 --> 29:57.853
There was a quack Doctor that
actually lived in this house

29:57.854 --> 30:01.090
by the name of Linda Hazzard.

30:01.091 --> 30:06.262
There was 20 to 40 people that we
know of that were murdered here.

30:06.263 --> 30:09.632
She ran an alternative
medicine type of a place

30:09.633 --> 30:14.637
where she used different therapies
instead of modern medicine

30:14.638 --> 30:17.406
to try to cure people of
whatever disease they had.

30:17.407 --> 30:20.577
In her process, she killed quite a few.

30:20.578 --> 30:22.311
She starved her patients to death.

30:22.312 --> 30:23.112
What?

30:23.113 --> 30:29.013
Well, that's how she thought she
was gonna cure whatever ailed them.

30:29.732 --> 30:32.012
Wow, okay.

30:32.100 --> 30:34.624
She killed a lot. She
had hundreds of patients.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.492
Some of them were kids.

30:36.493 --> 30:38.901
So this.. There was a lot
of death in this house.

30:38.902 --> 30:43.365
There's so many people,
and they're still dying.

30:43.366 --> 30:44.465
What do you mean by that?

30:44.466 --> 30:46.368
They're stuck in their death state.

30:46.369 --> 30:50.671
So they're constantly
feeling how they died.

30:50.672 --> 30:54.632
They just feel that all the time.

30:59.835 --> 31:01.203
What else were you getting on your walk?

31:01.204 --> 31:05.458
I kept getting the
sensation of drowning.

31:05.459 --> 31:06.471
Drowning?

31:06.472 --> 31:10.526
Yeah. I felt like I couldn't breathe.

31:10.527 --> 31:15.927
I felt like my head and my
chest were gonna explode.

31:16.363 --> 31:20.247
What you're describing
sounds like starvation.

31:20.248 --> 31:23.873
I interviewed a.. A pathologist,
and a lot of what you're saying

31:23.874 --> 31:25.146
are the same symptoms.

31:25.147 --> 31:27.719
Your organs cannibalize themselves.

31:27.720 --> 31:30.847
What happens is the muscles
around your ribcage shrink

31:30.848 --> 31:33.016
- and your diaphragm..
- Contracts.

31:33.017 --> 31:34.289
You can't breathe.

31:34.290 --> 31:37.678
He said, also, your
esophagus shuts down.

31:37.679 --> 31:39.719
- You can't swallow.
- Oh, my gosh.

31:39.720 --> 31:43.508
So that could sound like
drowning because of the symptoms,

31:43.509 --> 31:47.863
like, you can't breathe and
you can't catch your breath.

31:47.864 --> 31:51.365
Well, there's this pressure.

31:51.366 --> 31:55.386
He's fighting to breathe, to live.

31:56.338 --> 31:59.153
One of the people that..

31:59.154 --> 32:02.812
I actually got to
really communicate with..

32:02.813 --> 32:04.380
Was this woman.

32:04.381 --> 32:07.650
Um, she's really, really angry.

32:07.651 --> 32:10.570
I felt like she had
fallen down the stairs

32:10.571 --> 32:14.951
and she felt, like, pressured to do it.

32:15.140 --> 32:19.736
Um, so there was some kind of
weird situation going on there.

32:19.737 --> 32:24.734
You know, it sounds like
two sisters that were here.

32:24.735 --> 32:27.520
Claire and Dora Williamson.
They were two sisters.

32:27.521 --> 32:30.372
That came in around 1911..

32:30.373 --> 32:32.462
For treatment.

32:32.463 --> 32:35.144
Which entailed starvation.

32:35.145 --> 32:40.005
This was Dora just prior
to coming out here..

32:40.564 --> 32:45.120
And this is what she looked like
when they came and rescued her.

32:45.121 --> 32:47.521
Oh, my God.

32:51.955 --> 32:54.432
Claire wind up not making it.

32:54.433 --> 32:58.148
Linda Hazzard separated them, uh,
so they wouldn't see each other.

32:58.149 --> 33:01.170
Uh, she tried to manipulate them for
their money, because they were wealthy.

33:01.171 --> 33:03.976
They were British heiresses.

33:03.977 --> 33:07.443
Matter of fact, even at the trial,
when Linda Hazzard was arrested,

33:07.444 --> 33:13.344
Dora had said that Linda and the staff
here tried to tell her to commit suicide.

33:13.387 --> 33:18.254
So Claire, the older
sister, dies of starvation.

33:18.255 --> 33:19.956
Well, you know what?

33:19.957 --> 33:22.159
- She did her own autopsies, this woman.
- What?

33:22.160 --> 33:27.603
Yeah, they'd have every kind of disease
but starvation as cause of death.

33:27.604 --> 33:33.484
Cirrhosis of the liver was what
was written down for Claire.

33:33.588 --> 33:35.429
She called herself a Doctor.

33:35.430 --> 33:37.640
She was a frickin' psycho murderer..

33:37.641 --> 33:40.492
- Yeah.
- Is what she was.

33:40.493 --> 33:46.133
She was getting off on, you
know, torturing these people.

33:46.189 --> 33:49.731
A lot of the victims are out front..

33:49.732 --> 33:52.492
And you feel it.

33:52.547 --> 33:56.362
I did do a sketch of
the woman that I saw.

33:56.363 --> 34:00.203
Okay, let's take a look at it.

34:26.003 --> 34:28.190
I did do a sketch of

34:28.192 --> 34:30.199
- the woman that I saw, who fell..
- Oh, so it was a woman

34:30.201 --> 34:32.666
- you did the sketch of?
- Fell down the stairs, yeah.

34:32.667 --> 34:36.507
Okay, let's take a look at it.

35:00.656 --> 35:03.980
According to Amy, she sketched
the woman who fell down the stairs,

35:03.981 --> 35:06.991
which sounds a lot like
the sister who died here,

35:06.992 --> 35:11.390
but to me, this sketch
looks just like someone else.

35:11.391 --> 35:16.311
I know it sounds like
it may be Claire, but..

35:17.477 --> 35:20.260
I don't know. It looks..
This is Linda Hazzard.

35:20.261 --> 35:23.681
This is the psycho Doctor.

35:24.612 --> 35:28.632
- Oh.
- I mean, look at the nose.

35:29.183 --> 35:33.203
I think it's.. It's really close.

35:33.569 --> 35:37.289
To me, that's pretty spot-on.

35:37.544 --> 35:42.916
So why would it look like Linda,
but act like one of the victims?

35:42.917 --> 35:46.769
So there's two possibilities
as to why she's taking on

35:46.770 --> 35:50.091
characteristics of one of her victims.

35:50.092 --> 35:53.898
In one scenario, she
could be doing penance.

35:53.899 --> 35:56.965
Um, in having to experience

35:56.966 --> 35:59.970
all of the pain and..

35:59.971 --> 36:04.531
Emotions and, to some
extent, their lives.

36:05.434 --> 36:10.174
The other possibility
is that she's feeding.

36:12.981 --> 36:18.441
And she feeds off of them,
so she pulls their energy.

36:18.520 --> 36:22.420
And.. So she can sustain herself.

36:25.059 --> 36:27.528
This person feels trapped.

36:27.529 --> 36:30.431
She blames the living
for being trapped here.

36:30.432 --> 36:35.302
I think she's trying to do
harm to someone who's here.

36:35.303 --> 36:39.083
She has targeted, um, a female.

36:39.124 --> 36:41.676
In the other house.

36:41.677 --> 36:46.038
She's trying to figure
out the best method to..

36:46.039 --> 36:48.349
Inducing this person

36:48.350 --> 36:51.650
to fall down the stairs.

36:52.015 --> 36:54.789
This is what always amazes me about Amy.

36:54.790 --> 37:00.690
No one's told her that Logan's Mother
lives here, but she knew anyway.

37:01.034 --> 37:02.964
What else happened during the walk?

37:02.965 --> 37:05.633
I got very upset at one point.

37:05.634 --> 37:11.534
I got the information that someone was
trying to communicate with the dead here,

37:11.540 --> 37:17.060
and in doing so, had contributed
to trapping them here.

37:19.247 --> 37:22.142
This is the (Bleep) that
(Bleep) pisses me off.

37:22.143 --> 37:24.352
Oh, why don't you talk to
me, why don't you talk to me?

37:24.353 --> 37:25.609
Come on and talk to me.

37:25.610 --> 37:28.430
I get very angry.

37:29.668 --> 37:34.168
Logan conducted 17
séances in this house.

37:34.489 --> 37:38.632
He thinks he might have caused this,
so he thinks he inadvertently started

37:38.633 --> 37:42.053
something he can't finish.

37:43.569 --> 37:46.569
I feel bad that I..

37:46.808 --> 37:48.528
That I sort of stirred things up,

37:48.529 --> 37:52.181
because I had no idea what
it would.. What it would do.

37:52.182 --> 37:55.340
I feel.. I feel guilty for..

37:55.341 --> 37:58.268
Maybe setting these things in motion.

37:58.269 --> 38:02.556
You have to understand, like,
when you're doing things like that,

38:02.557 --> 38:06.441
it actually puts them in
more physical pain. So..

38:06.442 --> 38:08.703
Maybe you're communicating with,

38:08.704 --> 38:10.265
you know, these people,

38:10.266 --> 38:13.725
um, and yeah, we want to get
rid of them and all of that.

38:13.726 --> 38:19.366
Um, but the victims are in
already a state of confusion,

38:19.781 --> 38:25.681
and when you do that, it causes
them more pain, like, physical pain.

38:29.661 --> 38:34.045
The victims are still in their
death state, and they died here.

38:34.046 --> 38:36.476
They're not going anywhere.

38:36.477 --> 38:41.592
She's feeding off of them
so that she can become mobile

38:41.593 --> 38:44.221
and do whatever the
heck she wants to do,

38:44.222 --> 38:48.474
and what does she want
to do more than anything?

38:48.475 --> 38:51.355
She wants to kill.

38:51.378 --> 38:53.298
Yeah.

38:53.391 --> 38:58.548
And she feels, for whatever
reason, the attraction to..

38:58.549 --> 39:03.635
Your wife and your Mother
is her intended victim.

39:03.636 --> 39:05.971
And that's her goal right now.

39:05.972 --> 39:10.412
This is her path, and she's a murderer.

39:15.393 --> 39:19.383
Listen, it's clear how
serious this situation is.

39:19.384 --> 39:24.178
Um, the question is now,
is how do you undo it?

39:24.179 --> 39:29.159
Um, for that, Amy's
gonna have to answer that.

39:31.651 --> 39:35.377
So there's a lot of
different things here.

39:35.378 --> 39:37.445
The house..

39:37.446 --> 39:39.862
Why is it still here?

39:39.863 --> 39:42.651
Um, because I've been
taking pieces from it

39:42.652 --> 39:46.912
to use to finish the house next door.

39:47.803 --> 39:50.022
By getting rid of this house..

39:50.023 --> 39:53.128
You will be releasing,

39:53.129 --> 39:55.082
so many people.

39:55.083 --> 39:57.026
The victims..

39:57.027 --> 39:59.553
Will be able to..

39:59.554 --> 40:01.205
Detach.

40:01.206 --> 40:04.653
And, granted, it's not gonna
be a wonderful process for them,

40:04.654 --> 40:06.755
but it's a process that
they've needed to go through

40:06.756 --> 40:09.658
for, like, a hundred years or something.

40:09.659 --> 40:14.397
So they'll detach from the
house, they'll detach from her,

40:14.398 --> 40:18.234
and they'll start to go
through their death process,

40:18.235 --> 40:24.135
so they'll actually go beyond just being
in that physical pain of just dying.

40:24.641 --> 40:28.456
I've encountered a lot of dead who
attach themselves to a property,

40:28.457 --> 40:31.794
or a part of a house, but
this case is different.

40:31.795 --> 40:34.533
The dead are connected
to the structure itself.

40:34.534 --> 40:38.588
Tearing it down should help
most of them to move on.

40:38.589 --> 40:41.598
As far as you're concerned..

40:41.599 --> 40:46.534
You need to step out of
the paranormal for now.

40:46.535 --> 40:50.813
So I'm getting from what you're
saying that you think he's a sensitive.

40:50.814 --> 40:52.734
Yeah.

40:53.551 --> 40:57.524
I think we've thought that he's
been sensitive for a long time.

40:57.525 --> 41:00.143
You know, because so much
of this has happened to him

41:00.144 --> 41:03.412
- more than anybody else.
- Anybody else, right.

41:03.413 --> 41:06.310
- Knocking off the séance nonsense..
- Yes.

41:06.311 --> 41:07.549
Is the first step.

41:07.550 --> 41:09.968
I mean, this is not a game,
especially when she's talking

41:09.969 --> 41:12.288
- about your Mom maybe being in danger.
- Yeah.

41:12.289 --> 41:16.969
- Do not play games with this.
- Definitely.

41:18.033 --> 41:19.154
Shane, tell me the truth.

41:19.155 --> 41:22.521
Are you gonna listen to Amy
and tear this structure down?

41:22.522 --> 41:25.311
Well, I'm gonna tear it down, for sure.

41:25.312 --> 41:27.242
It's definitely coming down.

41:27.243 --> 41:29.278
How do you feel about that?

41:29.279 --> 41:33.571
N.. Now that I know what is
happening, I think it should go.

41:33.572 --> 41:35.492
Okay.

41:35.948 --> 41:38.269
Although the solution may sound extreme,

41:38.270 --> 41:40.672
Logan and his family
face a lot of obstacles

41:40.673 --> 41:43.041
if they want to keep living here.

41:43.042 --> 41:47.656
I really hope they follow my advice
so that both they and the dead

41:47.657 --> 41:50.538
can find some peace.
