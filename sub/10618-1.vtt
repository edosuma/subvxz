WEBVTT

00:03.780 --> 00:06.977
...that a force darker
than jealousy...

00:10.700 --> 00:13.214
...and stronger than love...

00:13.420 --> 00:16.730
...had begun to take hold...

00:17.140 --> 00:18.368
...of Satine?

00:25.140 --> 00:27.176
Where is she?

00:35.380 --> 00:38.736
-Will she be up by tonight?
-Tomorrow at the earliest.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.492
The Duke's leaving!

00:46.980 --> 00:50.370
She's confessing!

00:50.900 --> 00:54.654
Confessing? Do you take me for
an imbecile, Zidler?

00:54.860 --> 00:57.932
She suddenly had a terrible desire...

00:58.140 --> 01:00.574
...to go to a priest and...

01:01.100 --> 01:02.977
...confess her sins.

01:03.940 --> 01:07.171
She wanted to be cleansed
of her former life.

01:07.940 --> 01:11.171
She looks upon tonight
as her wedding night.

01:11.380 --> 01:12.369
Wedding night?

01:12.660 --> 01:15.128
She's like a blushing bride.

01:15.340 --> 01:18.138
She says you make her feel like a...

01:19.460 --> 01:20.654
...virgin.

01:22.180 --> 01:23.169
Virgin?

01:23.380 --> 01:25.450
You know. Touched...

01:25.860 --> 01:28.215
...for the very first time.

01:29.860 --> 01:33.853
She says it feels so good inside...

01:34.660 --> 01:36.730
...when you hold her...

01:37.100 --> 01:39.614
...and you touch her.

01:40.580 --> 01:42.650
Like a virgin.

01:42.980 --> 01:47.178
She's made it through the wilderness
somehow. She's made it through.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.412
She didn't know how lost she was

01:50.620 --> 01:53.851
Until she found you

01:54.500 --> 01:57.651
She was beat
Incomplete

01:58.020 --> 02:02.172
She'd been had
She was sad and blue

02:03.380 --> 02:06.178
But you made her feel

02:06.340 --> 02:09.332
Yes, you made her feel

02:10.180 --> 02:12.410
Shiny and new

02:14.780 --> 02:16.452
Like a virgin

02:17.260 --> 02:19.728
Touched for the very first time

02:20.300 --> 02:22.609
Like a virgin

02:23.060 --> 02:25.449
When your hearts beat
Both in time

02:25.660 --> 02:28.094
Gonna give you all her love

02:28.420 --> 02:30.934
Her fear is fading fast

02:31.740 --> 02:35.050
Been saving it all for you
Only love can last

02:36.220 --> 02:38.859
She's so fine
And she's thine

02:39.140 --> 02:41.779
She'll be yours
Till the end of time

02:42.020 --> 02:44.250
'Cause you made her feel

02:44.580 --> 02:49.335
Yes, you made her feel
She has nothing to hide

02:49.900 --> 02:51.379
Like a virgin

02:52.220 --> 02:54.450
Touched for the very first time

02:55.460 --> 02:57.530
Like a virgin

02:58.380 --> 03:00.735
When your hearts beat
Both in time

03:01.020 --> 03:02.738
Like a virgin

03:03.460 --> 03:05.849
Feels so good inside

03:06.340 --> 03:09.537
When you hold her and you touch her

03:44.940 --> 03:47.932
She's so fine
And she's mine

03:48.300 --> 03:49.574
Makes me strong

03:49.860 --> 03:54.058
Yes, she makes me bold
Now her love thawed out

03:54.460 --> 03:57.020
Yes, her love thawed out

03:57.300 --> 04:00.098
What was scared and cold

04:03.460 --> 04:05.530
Like a virgin

04:05.780 --> 04:08.010
Touched for the very first time

04:08.940 --> 04:11.135
Like a virgin

04:11.460 --> 04:14.133
When your hearts beat
Both in time

04:14.340 --> 04:16.375
Like a virgin

04:16.700 --> 04:18.611
Feels so good inside

04:19.740 --> 04:22.095
When you hold her
And you touch her

04:22.340 --> 04:25.173
When you hold her
And you touch her

04:35.620 --> 04:40.250
Like a virgin

04:52.860 --> 04:56.614
Harold Zidler's brilliant lies
had once again averted disaster.

04:59.300 --> 05:04.055
But no lie, however brilliant,
could save Satine.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.092
Monsieur Zidler...

05:12.260 --> 05:15.536
...Mademoiselle Satine is dying.
She has consumption.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.291
My little sparrow is dying?

05:25.660 --> 05:27.412
She mustn't know, Marie.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.811
The show must go on.

05:33.060 --> 05:36.769
All night, the penniless sitar player
had waited.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.490
And now, for the first time...

05:39.900 --> 05:43.256
...he felt the cold stab of jealousy.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.292
Where were you last night?

05:52.940 --> 05:54.009
l told you...

05:55.220 --> 05:56.619
...l was sick.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.816
You don't have to lie to me.

06:06.940 --> 06:08.612
We have to end it.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.332
Everyone knows.

06:14.620 --> 06:15.939
Harold knows.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.939
Sooner or later,
the Duke will find out too.

06:27.460 --> 06:30.452
On opening night,
l have to sleep with the Duke.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.939
And the jealousy will drive you mad.

06:44.020 --> 06:46.215
-Christian--
-Then l'll write a song.

06:46.420 --> 06:49.537
We'll put it in the show
and whatever happens...

06:49.740 --> 06:52.777
...when you hear it or sing it
or hum it...

06:53.020 --> 06:56.456
...it'll mean we love each other.
l won't get jealous.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.260
Things don't work that way, Christian.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.894
We have to end it.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.416
Never knew...

07:21.940 --> 07:24.818
...I could feel like this

07:28.700 --> 07:32.010
Like I've never seen the sky...

07:34.580 --> 07:36.218
...before

07:37.460 --> 07:39.291
Want to vanish...

07:39.660 --> 07:42.572
...inside your kiss

07:45.460 --> 07:48.418
This new scene is where
the sitar player...

07:48.620 --> 07:52.408
...writes a secret song for
the courtesan, so whatever happens...

07:52.620 --> 07:57.136
...however bad things are,
they remember their love.

07:57.380 --> 08:01.373
We could take it from your line, Satine.
Let's take it from there.

08:01.580 --> 08:02.854
We must be careful.

08:03.100 --> 08:07.491
Fear not. We will conduct our love
affair under the maharajah's--

08:07.700 --> 08:10.578
Seasons may change

08:11.220 --> 08:13.893
Winter to spring

08:14.860 --> 08:17.215
Honestly, amigo, this is impossible!

08:17.740 --> 08:19.014
But I love you

08:20.380 --> 08:22.894
Until the end...

08:23.380 --> 08:26.099
...of time

08:26.740 --> 08:31.256
Come what may

08:33.460 --> 08:37.931
Come what may

08:40.220 --> 08:43.256
I will love you

08:43.860 --> 08:49.457
Until my dying day

08:56.660 --> 08:58.571
Suddenly, the world

08:58.780 --> 09:01.692
Seems such a perfect place

09:01.940 --> 09:03.532
My dear, a little frog!

09:03.820 --> 09:05.776
Suddenly it moves

09:06.020 --> 09:09.012
With such a perfect grace

09:10.260 --> 09:13.616
Suddenly my life doesn't...

09:13.900 --> 09:16.334
...seem such a waste

09:17.940 --> 09:21.012
It all revolves around you

09:23.020 --> 09:24.897
And there's no mountain

09:25.180 --> 09:27.091
Too high

09:27.460 --> 09:30.975
No river too wide

09:31.260 --> 09:34.297
Sing out this song
And I'll be...

09:34.620 --> 09:37.373
...there by your side

09:38.500 --> 09:40.695
Storm clouds may gather

09:41.060 --> 09:44.257
And stars may collide

09:47.900 --> 09:49.219
But I love you

09:49.820 --> 09:51.253
I love you

09:51.460 --> 09:53.371
Until the end...

09:54.220 --> 09:56.131
...of time

09:57.100 --> 10:00.410
Come what may

10:02.940 --> 10:07.456
Come what may

10:10.380 --> 10:13.497
I will love you

10:34.740 --> 10:37.618
The magical sitar falls from the roof
and says:

10:37.820 --> 10:40.209
"The greatest thing you'll
ever learn...

10:40.700 --> 10:44.932
...is just to love and be loved
in return."

10:45.180 --> 10:47.057
This ending is silly.

10:47.260 --> 10:50.332
Why would the courtesan
go for the penniless writer?

10:50.540 --> 10:54.294
Whoops. l mean, sitar player.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.934
Come what may

11:04.820 --> 11:07.288
I will love you

11:08.100 --> 11:10.614
Come what may

11:11.740 --> 11:14.937
Yes, I will love you

11:15.860 --> 11:18.897
Come what may

11:19.740 --> 11:21.970
I will love you

11:23.420 --> 11:28.494
Till my dying day

11:35.540 --> 11:37.132
l don't like this ending.

11:42.180 --> 11:43.932
Don't like the ending?

11:44.140 --> 11:46.529
Why would the courtesan choose...

11:46.740 --> 11:49.937
...a penniless sitar player
over the maharajah...

11:50.180 --> 11:55.049
...who is offering a lifetime of
security? That's real love.

11:55.260 --> 11:58.536
Once the sitar player
has satisfied his lust...

11:58.740 --> 12:00.935
...he will leave her with nothing.

12:01.180 --> 12:04.889
l suggest that in the end,
the courtesan choose the maharajah.

12:05.140 --> 12:06.937
But, but.... Sorry.

12:08.180 --> 12:11.616
That ending does not uphold
the Bohemian ideals of...

12:11.900 --> 12:13.572
...truth, beauty, freedom--

12:13.780 --> 12:16.135
l don't care about
your ridiculous dogma!

12:16.860 --> 12:19.454
Why shouldn't the courtesan
choose the maharajah?

12:19.660 --> 12:21.730
Because she doesn't love you!

12:27.580 --> 12:28.569
Him.

12:30.820 --> 12:32.936
Him. She doesn't love...

12:33.260 --> 12:34.852
...she doesn't love him.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.452
Now l see.

12:49.860 --> 12:50.975
Monsieur Zidler.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.768
This ending will be rewritten...

12:54.580 --> 12:57.777
...with the courtesan choosing
the maharajah...

12:58.900 --> 13:02.415
...and without the lovers' secret song.

13:04.580 --> 13:08.971
lt will be rehearsed in the morning,
ready for the opening tomorrow night.

13:09.180 --> 13:12.377
My dear Duke,
that will be quite impossible.

13:12.580 --> 13:13.899
Harold.

13:15.700 --> 13:19.329
The poor Duke is
being treated appallingly.

13:20.820 --> 13:24.733
These silly writers let their
imaginations run away with them.

13:30.260 --> 13:32.216
Why don't you and l...

13:33.340 --> 13:35.092
...have a little supper?

13:37.460 --> 13:39.530
Then afterwards...

13:40.660 --> 13:45.097
...we can let Monsieur Zidler know
how we would prefer the story to end.

13:53.580 --> 13:55.332
Thank you, Elizabeth.

13:57.140 --> 13:59.176
l don't want you to sleep with him.

14:01.580 --> 14:03.616
He could destroy everything.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.290
lt's for us.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.092
You promised.

14:16.700 --> 14:20.613
You promised me
you wouldn't be jealous.

14:26.020 --> 14:27.817
lt will be all right.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.898
Yes, it will.

14:31.820 --> 14:33.378
He's waiting.

14:47.660 --> 14:48.934
Come...

14:50.260 --> 14:53.457
... what may

15:08.180 --> 15:09.738
Come what may.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.339
She had gone to the tower
to save us all.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.538
And for our part...

15:27.260 --> 15:30.297
... we could do nothing but wait.

15:34.820 --> 15:38.699
My dear Duke. l hope l have not
kept you waiting.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.537
Don't worry, Shakespeare.
You'll get your ending.

16:02.740 --> 16:04.651
Once the Duke gets his...

16:04.980 --> 16:07.096
...end in.

16:08.140 --> 16:09.289
Nini. No, no.

16:10.420 --> 16:12.251
Keep your hands off me!

16:18.620 --> 16:22.374
Never fall in love with a woman
who sells herself.

16:22.580 --> 16:24.650
lt always ends bad!

16:32.060 --> 16:34.858
The boy has a ridiculous obsession
with me.

16:35.700 --> 16:39.534
l indulge his fantasy
because he's talented.

16:39.860 --> 16:44.092
We need him...but only
until tomorrow night.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.336
We have a dance...

16:53.740 --> 16:56.379
...in the brothels of Buenos Aires.

17:11.980 --> 17:13.299
lt tells the story...

17:18.579 --> 17:20.172
...of a prostitute...

17:36.580 --> 17:38.536
...and a man...

17:40.540 --> 17:43.054
...who falls in love...

17:44.980 --> 17:46.538
...with her.

18:02.060 --> 18:03.288
First...

18:03.500 --> 18:05.252
...there is desire!

18:11.540 --> 18:13.292
Then...passion!

18:20.500 --> 18:22.536
Then suspicion!

18:27.260 --> 18:30.138
Jealousy! Anger! Betrayal!

18:30.900 --> 18:33.778
When love is for the highest bidder,
there is no trust.

18:34.140 --> 18:36.176
Without trust, there is no love!

18:37.860 --> 18:38.975
Jealousy--

18:39.700 --> 18:41.452
--yes, jealousy--

18:42.500 --> 18:45.298
--will drive you mad!

18:48.820 --> 18:50.731
Roxanne

18:52.220 --> 18:56.054
You don't have to
Put on that red light

18:58.100 --> 19:00.614
Walk the streets for money

19:00.980 --> 19:04.893
You don't care if it's wrong
Or if it's right

19:05.580 --> 19:07.571
Roxanne

19:08.980 --> 19:12.973
You don't have to
Wear that dress tonight

19:13.620 --> 19:15.850
Roxanne

19:17.620 --> 19:22.136
You don't have to
Sell your body to the night

19:23.420 --> 19:26.730
His eyes upon your face

19:27.620 --> 19:31.249
His hand upon your hand

19:31.860 --> 19:34.579
His lips caress your skin

19:36.060 --> 19:41.214
It's more than I can stand

19:43.220 --> 19:45.290
Roxanne

19:45.580 --> 19:50.415
Why does my heart cry

19:51.380 --> 19:53.291
Roxanne

19:53.940 --> 19:55.851
Feelings...

19:56.220 --> 19:59.417
...I can't fight

20:00.100 --> 20:03.536
You're free to leave me

20:03.860 --> 20:07.535
But just don't deceive me

20:07.860 --> 20:11.250
And please believe me

20:11.660 --> 20:13.173
When I say

20:13.500 --> 20:15.855
I love you

20:17.180 --> 20:19.535
When this production succeeds...

20:20.460 --> 20:23.054
...you will no longer be
a cancan dancer...

20:23.940 --> 20:25.134
...but an actress.

20:26.900 --> 20:28.333
l will make you...

20:30.140 --> 20:31.414
...a star.

20:40.060 --> 20:41.618
Accept it...

20:42.140 --> 20:45.928
...as a gift from this maharajah
to his courtesan.

20:49.420 --> 20:50.614
And....

20:52.580 --> 20:54.218
And the ending?

20:57.460 --> 21:01.419
Let Zidler keep his fairy-tale ending.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.258
Roxanne

21:03.540 --> 21:06.134
Why does my...

21:06.620 --> 21:09.293
...heart cry?

21:10.460 --> 21:12.212
Feelings...

21:13.740 --> 21:17.289
...I can't fight

21:18.260 --> 21:21.332
You're free to leave me

21:21.620 --> 21:25.215
But just don't deceive me

21:25.420 --> 21:28.810
And please believe me

21:29.220 --> 21:31.415
When I say

21:32.060 --> 21:34.255
I love you

21:39.380 --> 21:41.769
Come what...

21:42.500 --> 21:44.809
...may

21:46.740 --> 21:48.970
I will love you

21:52.260 --> 21:54.899
Till my dying...

21:59.380 --> 22:01.132
...day

22:01.940 --> 22:02.736
No.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.253
No?

22:07.980 --> 22:08.969
l see.

22:10.740 --> 22:13.777
lt's our very own
penniless sitar player.

22:17.260 --> 22:19.615
-My dear Duke--
-Silence!

22:23.220 --> 22:25.256
You made me...

22:25.460 --> 22:27.530
...believe that you loved me!

22:41.460 --> 22:44.816
Why does my...

22:45.180 --> 22:47.694
...heart cry?

22:48.820 --> 22:51.095
Feelings...

22:52.060 --> 22:55.416
...I can't fight

24:08.980 --> 24:12.370
l couldn't.
l couldn't go through with it.

24:12.580 --> 24:17.449
l saw you there, and l felt
differently and l couldn't pretend.

24:18.140 --> 24:20.370
And the Duke, he saw!

24:20.820 --> 24:22.458
He saw and he--

24:25.780 --> 24:27.691
Christian, l love you.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.857
lt's okay.

24:30.140 --> 24:33.337
l couldn't do it. l didn't want to
pretend anymore.

24:33.620 --> 24:36.054
l didn't want to lie. l don't.

24:36.660 --> 24:39.220
And he knows. He knows and he--

24:39.540 --> 24:42.293
You don't have to pretend anymore.
We'll leave.

24:42.820 --> 24:44.492
We'll leave tonight.

24:44.820 --> 24:46.253
Leave?

24:48.180 --> 24:49.613
But the show--

24:50.300 --> 24:51.858
l don't care.

24:52.060 --> 24:54.051
l don't care about the show.

24:56.060 --> 24:59.689
We have each other.
That's all that matters.

25:01.180 --> 25:02.579
Yes.

25:02.940 --> 25:05.170
As long as we have each other.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.258
We have each other.

25:10.420 --> 25:13.298
Chocolat, take Satine to
her dressing room to pack.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.333
-No one must see you.
-l understand.

25:16.660 --> 25:19.697
Darling, you go and pack.
l'll be waiting.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.009
lt's the boy.

25:25.220 --> 25:28.849
He has bewitched her with words.

25:29.060 --> 25:32.336
l want her back, Zidler. Find her.

25:34.380 --> 25:35.369
Tell her...

25:36.820 --> 25:40.210
...that the show will end my way...

25:40.540 --> 25:44.215
...and she will come to me
when the curtain falls...

25:46.580 --> 25:48.810
...or l'll have the boy killed.

25:49.620 --> 25:50.735
Killed?

25:56.660 --> 25:57.934
Killed.

26:08.660 --> 26:10.730
Forgive the intrusion, cherub.

26:11.620 --> 26:12.973
You're wasting your time.

26:13.220 --> 26:14.653
You don't understand.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.779
The Duke is going to kill Christian.

26:20.300 --> 26:22.256
He is insanely jealous.

26:22.580 --> 26:25.572
Do his ending and sleep with him
tomorrow night...

26:25.860 --> 26:28.897
...or the Duke will
have Christian killed.

26:41.780 --> 26:42.815
He can't scare us.

26:43.300 --> 26:46.372
He's a powerful man.
You know he can do it.

26:51.580 --> 26:54.378
-What are you doing?
-l don't need you anymore!

26:54.660 --> 26:59.211
You always made me believe l was only
worth what someone would pay for me!

26:59.420 --> 27:01.695
But Christian loves me.

27:02.740 --> 27:03.809
He loves me.

27:04.660 --> 27:06.571
He loves me.

27:06.900 --> 27:08.458
And that is worth everything.

27:09.500 --> 27:14.699
We're going away from you, away from
the Duke, away from the Moulin Rouge!

27:15.380 --> 27:16.972
Goodbye, Harold.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.052
You're dying, Satine.

27:24.300 --> 27:25.858
You're dying.

27:35.860 --> 27:36.929
Another trick?

27:37.140 --> 27:40.496
No, my love.
The doctor told us.

27:42.620 --> 27:43.609
Marie?

27:59.780 --> 28:01.372
l'm dying.

28:08.060 --> 28:10.210
I was a fool...

28:10.980 --> 28:12.254
...to...

28:13.540 --> 28:15.178
...believe

28:17.700 --> 28:19.611
A fool...

28:21.100 --> 28:24.888
...to believe

28:27.180 --> 28:28.738
It all...

28:29.100 --> 28:33.378
...ends today

28:34.380 --> 28:36.735
Yes, it all...

28:37.100 --> 28:39.136
...ends...

28:41.580 --> 28:44.572
...today

28:47.740 --> 28:49.856
Send Christian away.

28:50.900 --> 28:52.731
Only you can save him.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.092
He'll fight for me.

29:02.060 --> 29:04.858
Unless he believes you don't love him.

29:07.500 --> 29:12.574
You're a great actress, Satine.
Make him believe you don't love him.

29:15.740 --> 29:17.617
Use your talent to save him.

29:18.980 --> 29:20.413
Hurt him.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.611
Hurt him to save him.

29:25.220 --> 29:27.131
There is no other way.

29:28.380 --> 29:31.577
The show must go on, Satine.

29:32.660 --> 29:35.254
We're creatures of the underworld.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.215
We can't afford to love.

29:40.900 --> 29:44.575
Today's...

29:44.900 --> 29:47.619
...the day...

29:48.580 --> 29:53.096
... when dreaming...

29:54.980 --> 29:59.610
...ends

30:06.820 --> 30:09.095
Another hero...

30:10.220 --> 30:12.893
...another mindless crime

30:13.700 --> 30:15.770
Behind the curtain...

30:16.740 --> 30:19.174
...in the pantomime

30:20.900 --> 30:23.334
On and on

30:24.180 --> 30:29.095
Does anybody know
What we are living for?

30:29.380 --> 30:32.133
Whatever happens

30:32.820 --> 30:35.698
We leave it all to chance

30:35.940 --> 30:37.851
Another heartache

30:38.980 --> 30:42.211
Another failed romance

30:43.300 --> 30:45.860
On and on

30:46.220 --> 30:48.415
Does anybody know

30:48.740 --> 30:51.618
What we are living for?

30:53.940 --> 30:56.738
The show must go on

30:59.300 --> 31:01.689
The show must go on

31:06.220 --> 31:10.054
Outside, the dawn is breaking
On the stage

31:10.340 --> 31:14.049
That holds our final destiny

31:15.620 --> 31:19.135
The show must go on

31:21.220 --> 31:24.212
The show must go on

31:28.060 --> 31:30.654
Inside, my heart is breaking

31:32.140 --> 31:35.610
My makeup may be flaking

31:37.220 --> 31:39.336
But my smile...

31:39.860 --> 31:43.375
...still stays on

31:43.580 --> 31:47.937
The show must go on

31:49.300 --> 31:52.417
The show must go on

31:56.060 --> 31:58.733
I'll top the bill
I'll earn the kill

31:59.100 --> 32:02.888
I have to find the will to carry

32:03.260 --> 32:06.536
On with the
On with the

32:07.380 --> 32:11.851
On with the show

32:18.140 --> 32:21.291
On with the show!

32:26.420 --> 32:28.456
The show...

32:29.500 --> 32:32.060
...must go...

32:32.580 --> 32:35.333
...on

32:55.860 --> 32:57.134
What's wrong?

32:57.860 --> 32:59.816
l'm staying with the Duke.

33:01.260 --> 33:05.173
After l left, the Duke came to see me
and he offered me everything.

33:05.460 --> 33:07.451
Everything l've ever dreamed of.

33:08.380 --> 33:09.859
He has one condition.

33:11.700 --> 33:13.895
l must never see you again.

33:15.780 --> 33:16.849
l'm sorry.

33:17.100 --> 33:18.692
What are you talking about?

33:18.900 --> 33:21.573
-You knew who l was.
-What about last night?

33:21.780 --> 33:26.456
The difference between you and l is
that you can leave anytime you choose.

33:27.620 --> 33:29.451
But this is my home.

33:32.820 --> 33:35.254
The Moulin Rouge is my home.

33:36.780 --> 33:39.852
There must be something else.
This can't be real.

33:41.460 --> 33:45.135
Something's wrong. Tell me what it is.
Tell me the truth.

33:45.340 --> 33:47.092
Tell me the truth!

33:48.500 --> 33:49.933
The truth?

33:53.460 --> 33:55.178
The truth is...

33:55.780 --> 33:58.294
...l am the Hindi courtesan.

33:59.860 --> 34:02.897
And l choose the maharajah.

34:05.260 --> 34:07.820
That's how the story really ends.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.498
Jealousy has driven him mad!

34:37.340 --> 34:39.251
Satine!

34:42.139 --> 34:44.210
Satine!

34:48.139 --> 34:49.458
Satine!

35:22.740 --> 35:25.129
Things aren't always as they seem.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.535
Things are exactly as they seem.

35:28.660 --> 35:33.290
Christian, you may see me only as
a drunken, vice-ridden gnome...

35:33.620 --> 35:36.657
...whose friends are just pimps
and prostitutes.

35:37.460 --> 35:40.054
But l know about art and love...

35:40.940 --> 35:45.456
...if only because l long for it
with every fiber of my being.

35:46.140 --> 35:49.610
She loves you. l know it.
l know she loves you.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.374
Go away, Toulouse. Leave me alone.

35:56.060 --> 35:57.937
Go away.

36:00.980 --> 36:02.538
Go away!

36:12.780 --> 36:16.295
I wanted to shut out
what Toulouse had said...

36:16.660 --> 36:19.379
...but he had filled me with doubt.

36:19.580 --> 36:22.219
There was only one way to be sure.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.730
I had to know.

36:27.580 --> 36:30.731
So I returned to the Moulin Rouge...

36:31.700 --> 36:35.090
...one last time.

36:50.620 --> 36:53.453
She is mine!

37:00.420 --> 37:02.217
I only speak the truth

37:02.420 --> 37:04.172
I only speak the truth

38:23.540 --> 38:25.178
Kiss

38:25.460 --> 38:27.257
Hand

38:27.540 --> 38:28.814
Diamonds

38:29.180 --> 38:31.216
Best friend

38:31.860 --> 38:33.612
Kiss

38:33.940 --> 38:35.692
Grand

38:36.060 --> 38:37.334
Diamonds

38:37.620 --> 38:39.531
Best friend

38:40.180 --> 38:41.454
Men

38:42.060 --> 38:44.051
Cold

38:44.540 --> 38:46.132
Girls

38:46.460 --> 38:47.859
Old

38:48.220 --> 38:51.849
And we all lose our charms

38:52.340 --> 38:54.251
In the end

39:05.340 --> 39:06.819
Diamonds are a

39:07.420 --> 39:09.217
Diamonds are a

39:09.540 --> 39:11.610
Diamonds are a

39:18.140 --> 39:20.654
Diamonds are a...

39:28.260 --> 39:29.932
...girl's...

39:31.260 --> 39:34.297
...best...

39:35.220 --> 39:37.780
...friend

39:39.940 --> 39:41.498
She is mine.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.851
She is mine.

40:00.660 --> 40:03.333
l know she still loves him.
There must be a reason.

40:03.540 --> 40:05.929
How about one of them
is a duke and--

40:06.140 --> 40:10.292
Then you agree something is wrong.
But what? What?

40:13.780 --> 40:17.329
l raise high
my ceremonial wedding sword...

40:17.620 --> 40:21.249
...and welcome my loyal subjects
to join with us...

40:21.460 --> 40:23.178
...in celebration....

40:26.860 --> 40:29.169
What a magnificent performance.

40:29.500 --> 40:32.492
A little bit more for me, lovey.
That's a girl.

40:36.220 --> 40:37.448
The boy is here.

40:37.740 --> 40:40.459
l told Satine if he came near her,
he'd be killed!

40:40.660 --> 40:42.378
He very soon will be.

40:52.540 --> 40:54.132
He will be killed.

40:54.460 --> 40:57.770
That's why she's pushing him away.
To save him.

40:58.140 --> 40:59.414
That's it.

40:59.700 --> 41:00.815
Christian!

41:04.140 --> 41:05.892
Oh, God, this is high up.

41:06.460 --> 41:08.655
l've come to pay my bill.

41:10.620 --> 41:12.656
You shouldn't be here, Christian.

41:14.420 --> 41:15.694
Just leave.

41:19.260 --> 41:20.818
Killed. Killed.

41:22.300 --> 41:23.369
l must warn him!

41:27.660 --> 41:31.050
You made me believe you loved me.
l should pay you.

41:32.180 --> 41:33.408
She has to go on-stage!

41:33.620 --> 41:36.532
Jealousy has driven the sitar player
into hiding.

41:37.180 --> 41:38.772
You did your job very well.

41:39.060 --> 41:40.459
Persian army, go!

41:40.980 --> 41:42.413
The boy's taken Satine.

41:43.060 --> 41:45.494
l should pay you
like everyone else does!

41:45.700 --> 41:47.691
Don't, Christian. There's no point.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.652
Just leave.

41:50.940 --> 41:53.579
They're going to kill the poor boy!

41:53.780 --> 41:55.930
l have found them.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.295
Stop him.

42:01.460 --> 42:05.248
lf you don't love me and it wasn't real,
why can't l pay you?

42:05.460 --> 42:08.020
Let the palace doors be opened!

42:08.220 --> 42:09.255
Christian!

42:09.460 --> 42:12.054
Open the doors!

42:13.820 --> 42:15.970
Let me pay! Let me pay!

42:16.820 --> 42:17.889
Open the doors.

42:18.140 --> 42:20.415
Tell me you don't love me!

42:20.620 --> 42:21.939
Open the doors!

42:22.780 --> 42:24.054
Christian!

42:24.260 --> 42:25.852
Tell me you don't love me!

42:48.060 --> 42:50.255
l am not fooled!

42:50.460 --> 42:54.897
Though he has shaved off his beard
and adopts a disguise...

42:55.260 --> 42:57.615
...my eyes do not lie!

42:58.740 --> 43:00.173
For it is he!

43:00.380 --> 43:03.531
The same penniless sitar player!

43:04.820 --> 43:07.095
Driven mad by jealousy!

43:11.260 --> 43:12.898
Oh, God, no.

43:30.100 --> 43:31.294
She is yours now.

43:35.580 --> 43:37.457
l've paid my whore!

43:41.220 --> 43:42.938
l owe you nothing.

43:45.820 --> 43:47.890
And you are nothing to me.

43:52.260 --> 43:56.776
Thank you for curing me of
my ridiculous obsession with love.

44:08.420 --> 44:10.331
l can't remember my line.

44:18.220 --> 44:20.336
This sitar player...

44:20.540 --> 44:22.178
...doesn't love you.

44:22.500 --> 44:24.809
See? He flees the kingdom!

44:25.980 --> 44:27.971
Pumpkin, it's for the best.

44:28.780 --> 44:31.738
You know it is.
The show must go on.

44:33.820 --> 44:35.811
And now, my bride...

44:36.100 --> 44:40.173
...it is time for you to raise
your voice to the heavens...

44:40.380 --> 44:43.452
...and say your wedding vows.

44:44.260 --> 44:45.409
l've got it!

44:45.620 --> 44:46.735
Christian!

44:50.100 --> 44:52.853
The greatest thing you'll
ever learn...

44:53.220 --> 44:54.619
...is just to love...

44:55.380 --> 44:57.655
...and be loved...

44:57.980 --> 45:01.256
...in return!

45:16.740 --> 45:18.617
Never knew...

45:20.860 --> 45:22.339
...I could...

45:24.420 --> 45:25.978
...feel...

45:26.620 --> 45:28.690
...like this

45:32.300 --> 45:35.451
It's like I've never seen

45:37.300 --> 45:41.816
The sky before

45:43.380 --> 45:45.814
Want to vanish...

45:46.380 --> 45:48.291
...inside...

45:48.500 --> 45:50.775
...your kiss

45:52.540 --> 45:56.249
Every day I'm loving you

45:56.580 --> 45:59.572
More and more

46:00.500 --> 46:02.570
Listen to my heart

46:04.100 --> 46:06.773
Can you hear it sing?

46:08.940 --> 46:11.295
Come back to me

46:11.740 --> 46:14.618
And forgive...

46:14.940 --> 46:17.977
...everything

46:24.500 --> 46:27.458
Seasons may change

46:29.220 --> 46:32.417
Winter to spring

46:40.300 --> 46:41.938
l love you.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.377
Till the end...

46:46.180 --> 46:47.408
...of...

46:48.660 --> 46:50.332
...time

46:56.220 --> 47:01.294
Come what may

47:07.780 --> 47:12.251
Come what may

47:17.300 --> 47:21.088
Come what may

47:24.620 --> 47:28.090
Come what may

47:33.380 --> 47:35.291
I will love you

47:36.580 --> 47:39.174
I will love you

47:39.620 --> 47:42.498
Until my dying...

47:46.380 --> 47:47.779
...day

47:48.140 --> 47:52.577
Come what may

47:54.340 --> 47:57.093
Come what may

48:03.700 --> 48:07.295
I will love you

48:08.740 --> 48:10.651
Until my dying--

48:11.420 --> 48:13.251
Christian, he's got a gun!

48:22.300 --> 48:24.495
They're trying to kill you!

48:26.380 --> 48:27.369
Shut up!

48:27.620 --> 48:28.848
He has a gun!

48:29.100 --> 48:30.658
Guards, seize them!

48:30.860 --> 48:32.498
Vive la vie de boheme!

48:43.580 --> 48:45.457
No problem. Go back to work!

48:46.500 --> 48:47.899
No matter what you say

48:49.260 --> 48:51.615
The show is ending our way

48:53.220 --> 48:56.132
Come on and stand your ground

48:57.060 --> 49:00.575
For freedom

49:01.260 --> 49:02.773
Beauty

49:03.100 --> 49:05.534
Truth and love

49:09.340 --> 49:13.379
One day I'll fly away

49:13.820 --> 49:17.415
My gift is my song

49:41.540 --> 49:44.259
I will love you

49:48.540 --> 49:51.930
Yes, I will love you

49:56.740 --> 49:59.300
I will love you

50:01.220 --> 50:02.494
My way!

50:02.980 --> 50:04.049
My way!

50:05.260 --> 50:07.330
My way! My way!

50:30.460 --> 50:32.735
Stand by for curtain call.

50:33.860 --> 50:36.135
Dancers, positions, please.

51:08.980 --> 51:10.936
Satine? What's the matter?

51:12.900 --> 51:17.098
What is it?
Tell me. What's the matter?

51:17.380 --> 51:20.417
Tell me. Satine?
What's the matter?

51:24.420 --> 51:26.172
Oh, my God.

51:36.580 --> 51:38.491
Somebody get some help!

51:39.100 --> 51:41.295
Hold the curtain. Fetch the doctor.

51:41.500 --> 51:43.616

51:50.460 --> 51:52.132

Hold me.

52:20.460 --> 52:21.779

52:25.940 --> 52:28.408
You've got to go on, Christian.

52:28.620 --> 52:30.690
l can't go on without you.

52:31.700 --> 52:34.817
You've got so much to give.

52:43.780 --> 52:46.169
Tell our story, Christian.

52:52.900 --> 52:54.492
Promise me.

52:57.700 --> 52:58.974

53:04.420 --> 53:05.853
That way...

53:07.300 --> 53:10.212
...l'll always be with you.

55:09.500 --> 55:12.094
There was...

55:12.900 --> 55:15.778
...a boy

55:17.540 --> 55:21.135
A very strange...

55:21.460 --> 55:24.258
...enchanted...

55:26.340 --> 55:27.693
...boy

55:38.580 --> 55:43.415
Days turned into weeks.
Weeks turned into months.

55:43.660 --> 55:47.494
And then,
one not so very special day...

55:47.700 --> 55:51.454
...I went to my typewriter,
I sat down...

55:52.420 --> 55:54.490
...and I wrote our story.

55:56.300 --> 55:58.655
A story about a time...

55:59.100 --> 56:01.250
...a story about a place...

56:02.300 --> 56:04.291
...a story about the people.

56:05.460 --> 56:07.928
But above all things...

56:08.460 --> 56:11.770
...a story about love.

56:13.180 --> 56:17.856
A love that will live forever.

56:20.580 --> 56:21.854
The...

56:23.060 --> 56:24.413
...end.

56:28.740 --> 56:32.176
The greatest thing

56:33.540 --> 56:37.374
You'll ever learn

56:39.340 --> 56:42.969
Is just to love

56:44.980 --> 56:47.619
And be loved...

56:50.540 --> 56:54.453
...in return
