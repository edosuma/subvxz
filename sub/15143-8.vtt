So you guys finally agreed

It better say

00:49.000 --> 00:50.542
his name is, "Chip."

00:50.583 --> 00:52.291
- You mean, "Tiny Elvis."

00:52.333 --> 00:54.875
- The tag should say, "Gary."

00:54.917 --> 00:56.208
- Too late, fellas.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.750
The tag has spoken.

His name is, "Squishy Paws."

All your arguing

Look, he's even doing

01:10.125 --> 01:12.917
his sad-tail thing.

And, yes.

Yes, I was.

Does it look a little something

01:46.834 --> 01:50.417

They weren't supposed to put me

08:14.000 --> 08:16.625
- Yeah, we adopted him

08:14.000 --> 08:16.625
from the pound.

08:16.667 --> 08:19.291
That's good, right?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.583
- Wow.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.625
I just took an open-eyed nap.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.583
Sorry, kids, but that's not

08:23.667 --> 08:26.583
newsworthy.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.834
That's snooze-worthy.

08:28.875 --> 08:33.000
Veronica Miller,

08:28.875 --> 08:33.000
Channel 6 News.

08:33.041 --> 08:34.667
- Wait.

08:34.709 --> 08:36.709
We shouldn't be punished

08:34.709 --> 08:36.709
just because we couldn't decide

08:36.750 --> 08:39.333
between Chip, Gary,

08:36.750 --> 08:39.333
Squishy Paws, and Tiny Elvis.

08:39.375 --> 08:43.333
- His name is none

08:39.375 --> 08:43.333
of those ridiculous things.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.417
It's Lord Timothy.

08:46.458 --> 08:49.166
All:

08:46.458 --> 08:49.166
"Lord Timothy"?

08:49.208 --> 08:50.792
- Who are you?

08:50.834 --> 08:52.917
- I am the dog's

08:50.834 --> 08:52.917
rightful owner,

08:52.959 --> 08:55.208
and I've come to retrieve him

08:55.250 --> 08:57.875
from The Horrible Harpers.

08:59.375 --> 09:01.291
- Now, that's newsworthy.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.291
Okay.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.542
Veronica Miller,

09:03.333 --> 09:06.542
Channel 6 News.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.542
Hero dog update.

09:08.583 --> 09:10.542
Someone

09:08.583 --> 09:10.542
has just stepped forward

09:10.583 --> 09:12.792
claiming to be

09:10.583 --> 09:12.792
his rightful owner.

09:12.834 --> 09:13.917
Your name?

09:13.959 --> 09:16.000
- Eleanor Dumont.

09:16.041 --> 09:19.625
Lord Timothy

09:16.041 --> 09:19.625
disappeared after a fire

09:19.667 --> 09:22.875
at my country home

09:19.667 --> 09:22.875
during the high lake season.

09:22.917 --> 09:25.792
So you can imagine my surprise

09:25.834 --> 09:29.709
when I saw him

09:25.834 --> 09:29.709
on your news program.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.333
- She's lying!

09:29.750 --> 09:31.333
- [gasps]

09:31.375 --> 09:33.458
- Yeah, she just wants

09:31.375 --> 09:33.458
our hero dog.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.166
- Hey, everybody calm down.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.166
We'll handle this.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.000
- I'm sorry, ma'am, but you

09:36.208 --> 09:38.000
can't just walk out of here

09:38.041 --> 09:39.667
with our kids' dog.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.291
But you can walk out of here

09:39.709 --> 09:42.291
with his adorable face

09:42.333 --> 09:46.583
on this handsome T-shirt!

09:46.625 --> 09:48.083
- Naturally, I have come

09:48.125 --> 09:51.375
with the appropriate

09:48.125 --> 09:51.375
documentation.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.458
- Paperwork, really?

09:53.500 --> 09:55.125
Anyone can fake paperwork.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.458
- Yeah.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.792
I fake paperwork all the time.

09:58.834 --> 10:00.542
I'm not

09:58.834 --> 10:00.542
an actual real estate agent.

10:00.583 --> 10:04.208
I just use my fake card

10:00.583 --> 10:04.208
to impress the ladies.

10:07.709 --> 10:12.917
- You spelled "real"

10:07.709 --> 10:12.917
and "estate" incorrectly.

10:13.917 --> 10:17.500
- But I spelled

10:13.917 --> 10:17.500
my number right.

10:17.542 --> 10:19.000
Call me.

10:19.041 --> 10:21.125
- If you're really his owner,

10:21.166 --> 10:24.458
then what does the birthmark

10:21.166 --> 10:24.458
on his stomach look like?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.333
- The Mona Lisa.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.583
- She's right.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.583
- Of course I'm right.

10:34.625 --> 10:37.458
- Kids, I'm sorry, but he does

10:34.625 --> 10:37.458
seem to be her dog.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.417
- Of course he's my dog.

10:39.458 --> 10:43.083
- Lord Timothy!

10:39.458 --> 10:43.083
<i>Andiamo!</i>

10:43.125 --> 10:44.583
- He's fluent in Italian.

10:48.709 --> 10:52.500
Oh, I can't thank

10:48.709 --> 10:52.500
you children enough.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.792
If it hadn't been

10:52.542 --> 10:54.792
for your bickering,

10:54.834 --> 10:58.250
I never would have seen

10:54.834 --> 10:58.250
Lord Timothy on the news,

10:58.291 --> 11:02.125
and he wouldn't be going home

10:58.291 --> 11:02.125
with me right now.

11:05.417 --> 11:06.625
Ta.

11:10.792 --> 11:13.041
- Well, there you have it.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.083
Guess every dog

11:13.083 --> 11:16.083
does have his day.

11:16.125 --> 11:18.000
- [laughs]

11:16.125 --> 11:18.000
That was good.

11:20.208 --> 11:25.041
- Veronica Miller,

11:20.208 --> 11:25.041
Channel 6 News.

11:25.083 --> 11:28.333
Huh, turned out to be big

11:25.083 --> 11:28.333
and juicy after all.

11:28.375 --> 11:29.917
Ta.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.291
- Now I know

11:33.000 --> 11:35.291
what sad tail feels like.

11:45.125 --> 11:47.667
- I miss petting Chip.

11:47.709 --> 11:51.125
- I miss playing

11:47.709 --> 11:51.125
with Tiny Elvis.

11:51.166 --> 11:53.917
- [whimpering]

11:53.959 --> 11:55.583
- Guys! Help!

11:55.625 --> 11:57.375
Does--does any of this match?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.208
Squishy used

11:57.417 --> 11:59.208
to help me get dressed.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.333
One bark meant,

11:59.250 --> 12:01.333
"You are rocking that."

12:01.375 --> 12:04.333
two meant,

12:01.375 --> 12:04.333
"Total fashion disaster."

12:04.375 --> 12:07.500
- In that case,

12:04.375 --> 12:07.500
woof, woof.

12:07.542 --> 12:08.750
- I knew it.

12:08.792 --> 12:11.375
I'm lost without him.

12:11.417 --> 12:12.917
- Hey, guys.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.417
Tough morning?

12:14.458 --> 12:16.333
- We really miss the dog, Dad.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.458
- Yeah, it's not the same

12:16.375 --> 12:18.458
without him.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.917
- I wish we hadn't fought

12:18.500 --> 12:20.917
so much.

12:20.959 --> 12:24.458
- Look, I know this is hard,

12:20.959 --> 12:24.458
but you got to figure out a way

12:20.959 --> 12:24.458
to put the dog

12:20.959 --> 12:24.458
out of your mind.

12:24.500 --> 12:28.875
Now, I'm not going

12:24.500 --> 12:28.875
to hound you, but--

12:24.500 --> 12:28.875
- "Hound"?

12:24.500 --> 12:28.875
Too soon, Dad.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.667
- Sorry, kiddo.

12:28.917 --> 12:30.667
It just slipped out.

12:30.709 --> 12:32.542
I'm gonna fetch you up

12:30.709 --> 12:32.542
some "barkfast."

12:32.583 --> 12:34.375
Breakfast.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.250
It's the leash I can do.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.250
Wow!

12:36.291 --> 12:37.709
What is wrong with me?

12:37.750 --> 12:39.083
Who wants beagles?

12:37.750 --> 12:39.083
Bagels!

12:39.125 --> 12:40.583
Doggone it.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.583
Ah!

12:40.625 --> 12:42.375
I'm just going to walk out

12:40.625 --> 12:42.375
with my tail between my legs.

12:42.417 --> 12:43.291
Stop it!

12:42.417 --> 12:43.291
"Fleas" forgive me!

12:43.333 --> 12:44.375
I said "fleas"!

12:44.417 --> 12:46.125
Bad Tom! Bad Tom!

12:46.166 --> 12:50.792
- Oh, hey. Care to explain

12:46.166 --> 12:50.792
our new bath towels, Tom?

12:50.834 --> 12:54.500
- Oh, well, I figured why take

12:50.834 --> 12:54.500
a bath on the shirts when we can

12:50.834 --> 12:54.500
take a bath with the shirts.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.709
See where you see failure,

12:54.542 --> 12:56.709
I see opportunity.

12:56.750 --> 13:01.333
- Well, at least it wasn't

12:56.750 --> 13:01.333
a bedspread or curtains.

13:01.375 --> 13:05.542
Ugh.

13:01.375 --> 13:05.542
Bad Tom. Bad Tom.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.375
- Maybe it will help take

13:05.583 --> 13:07.375
our minds off the dog

13:07.417 --> 13:10.208
if we watch TV.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.500
- Veronica Miller,

13:10.250 --> 13:13.500
Channel 6 News.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.458
Hero dog update.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.750
- Not cool, TV.

13:17.792 --> 13:19.875
- At least we get

13:17.792 --> 13:19.875
to see him again.

13:19.917 --> 13:21.750
- We're here

13:19.917 --> 13:21.750
at the Dumont Mansion

13:21.792 --> 13:23.667
checking in with Lord Timothy

13:23.709 --> 13:29.041
after his rescue

13:23.709 --> 13:29.041
from The Horrible Harpers.

13:29.083 --> 13:33.125
And rest assured,

13:29.083 --> 13:33.125
our hero dog is now living

13:33.166 --> 13:37.542
the life of luxury

13:33.166 --> 13:37.542
he so richly deserves.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.542
- Hey, look,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.542
he has his sad tail.

13:47.917 --> 13:51.125
- And there.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.959
- Maybe he misses us

13:51.166 --> 13:53.959
as much as we miss him.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.250
- We need to visit him

13:54.000 --> 13:56.250
and try to cheer him up.

13:56.291 --> 13:58.250
- She lives by the golf course

13:56.291 --> 13:58.250
in Boulderly Hills.

13:58.291 --> 14:00.083
We can walk there.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.375
- Let's go.

14:01.417 --> 14:03.291
- Boulderly Hills

14:01.417 --> 14:03.291
is pretty fancy.

14:03.333 --> 14:07.000
You sure you want to go out

14:03.333 --> 14:07.000
looking all "woof, woof"?

14:07.041 --> 14:08.542
- Just let's go.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.834
[doorbell rings]

14:18.333 --> 14:20.000
- Oh.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.917
Well, if it isn't

14:20.041 --> 14:21.917
Nicky, Ricky, Dicky,

14:21.959 --> 14:24.625
and the one that doesn't rhyme.

14:24.667 --> 14:27.667
- Hi. We're sorry

14:24.667 --> 14:27.667
to bother you.

14:27.709 --> 14:31.125
We were wondering

14:27.709 --> 14:31.125
if we could visit Lord Timothy?

14:31.166 --> 14:32.208
- Very well.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.834
Walk this way.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.375
Wait in here while I inform

14:50.000 --> 14:53.375
Ms. Dumont of your visit.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.542
- This place is awesome.

14:58.583 --> 15:01.458
At least Tiny Elvis

14:58.583 --> 15:01.458
is living large.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.333
- Wow.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.333
Guess she really likes dogs.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.667
- Guys?

15:09.709 --> 15:13.125
Why would Ms. Dumont have

15:09.709 --> 15:13.125
a dog fur on the wall?

15:15.333 --> 15:17.375
- And a dog skeleton?

15:20.208 --> 15:22.417
- And a doggie cookbook?

15:22.458 --> 15:24.000
- Aah!

15:24.041 --> 15:28.041
The horror!

15:28.083 --> 15:31.542
Ah, there he is.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.709
- Ms. Dumont is a real-life

15:31.583 --> 15:33.709
Cruella de Vil.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.917
- She's gonna turn Chip

15:33.750 --> 15:35.917
into a fur coat.

15:35.959 --> 15:38.667
- And then she's going to serve

15:35.959 --> 15:38.667
Gary for dinner.

15:38.709 --> 15:40.583
- Someone's coming.

15:38.709 --> 15:40.583
Act normal.

15:43.667 --> 15:47.375
- Presenting Lord Timothy,

15:43.667 --> 15:47.375
fresh from the bath.

15:47.417 --> 15:49.291
- Squishy Paws.

15:47.417 --> 15:49.291
- Chip.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.875
- Tiny Elvis.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.875
- Gary.

15:51.917 --> 15:54.458
- Ms. Dumont is granting you

15:51.917 --> 15:54.458
five minutes alone.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.667
- [barking]

I'm a total fashion disaster.

16:04.417 --> 16:05.917
"Quaddle" up!

16:04.417 --> 16:05.917
- Wait.

16:05.959 --> 16:07.625
Is the a real "quaddle"?

16:07.667 --> 16:11.625
- Because "quaddle" me once...

16:07.667 --> 16:11.625
- Just get in here.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.083
We need to sneak Squishy Paws

16:11.667 --> 16:13.083
out of here

16:13.125 --> 16:15.208
before he ends up on a wall.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.709
- Or on a menu.

16:27.875 --> 16:30.875
- Where do you think you're

16:27.875 --> 16:30.875
going with Lord Timothy?

16:30.917 --> 16:32.208
All: Aah!

16:32.250 --> 16:34.208

All: Aah!

17:52.625 --> 17:54.417
- Squishy, do you know a way?

18:02.250 --> 18:04.333
- [barks]

18:02.250 --> 18:04.333
- Sweet, Tiny Elvis.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.667
- Come on, come on.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.667
Go, go, go, go.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.375
- Whoa.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.375
- Yes!

18:12.417 --> 18:16.875
We did it.

18:12.417 --> 18:16.875
We saved him.

18:16.917 --> 18:20.375
All: Aah!

18:20.417 --> 18:22.208
- How did she get here?

18:22.250 --> 18:23.709
- I bet the butler did it!

18:23.750 --> 18:26.542
- I did.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.542
I drove her here.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.500
- What were you kids thinking?

18:28.542 --> 18:30.291
You can't just take her dog.

18:30.333 --> 18:33.041
- She was going to turn

18:30.333 --> 18:33.041
Squishy Paws into a fur coat.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.709
- Oh, come on, he's barely big

18:33.083 --> 18:35.709
enough for a vest.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.000
Earmuffs, maybe.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.000
- It's true, Dad!

18:38.041 --> 18:40.333
She has dog furs

18:38.041 --> 18:40.333
and dog skeletons at her house!

18:40.375 --> 18:41.834
- And a dog cookbook!

18:41.875 --> 18:44.166
She was gonna make mutt-loaf

18:41.875 --> 18:44.166
out of Gary.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.959
- And she was dressed like

18:44.208 --> 18:45.959
a butcher.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.583
- Oh. I was only dressed

18:46.000 --> 18:48.583
that way

18:48.625 --> 18:51.834
because I was bathing

18:48.625 --> 18:51.834
Lord Timothy.

18:51.875 --> 18:55.792
- Then what about your little

18:51.875 --> 18:55.792
doggy chamber of doom?

18:55.834 --> 18:58.500
- I can see why you might think

18:55.834 --> 18:58.500
these things.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.583
But I would never hurt a dog.

19:00.625 --> 19:03.417
I am a canine historian.

19:03.458 --> 19:07.458
And the things that you saw

19:03.458 --> 19:07.458
were ancient artifacts--

19:07.500 --> 19:10.000
wolf pelts worn by hunters,

19:10.041 --> 19:13.709
the skeleton

19:10.041 --> 19:13.709
of an extinct species,

19:13.750 --> 19:17.333
and a cookbook of recipes

19:17.375 --> 19:19.166
made for dogs,

19:19.208 --> 19:21.625
not out of dogs.

19:23.417 --> 19:25.583
- I think you kids owe

19:23.417 --> 19:25.583
Ms. Dumont an apology.

19:25.625 --> 19:28.500
- Do we? Do we?

19:28.542 --> 19:30.792
- Pretty sure we do, Dicky.

19:30.834 --> 19:34.375
- Oh.

19:30.834 --> 19:34.375
Then sorry, Ms. Dumont.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.291
- Yeah, we're really sorry.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.250
- It's all right.

19:38.291 --> 19:40.667
I know that you were just

19:38.291 --> 19:40.667
looking out

19:40.709 --> 19:44.166
for Lord Timothy's welfare.

19:44.208 --> 19:47.667
And as much as it pains me,

19:44.208 --> 19:47.667
it's time to say good-bye.

19:50.917 --> 19:52.917
- Guess this is it,

19:50.917 --> 19:52.917
Squishy Paws.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.500
- Good-bye, Chip.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.500
- I'm gonna miss you, Gary.

19:55.542 --> 19:56.709
- High paw, Tiny Elvis.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.291
- I meant it's time for me

20:01.083 --> 20:03.291
to say good-bye.

20:03.333 --> 20:05.875
All: What?

20:05.917 --> 20:08.000
- When I first saw

20:05.917 --> 20:08.000
the news report,

20:08.041 --> 20:11.333
I thought that you didn't care

20:08.041 --> 20:11.333
about him.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.125
But when you thought

20:11.375 --> 20:14.125
that he was in danger

20:14.166 --> 20:17.667
and you risked so much

20:14.166 --> 20:17.667
to save him,

20:17.709 --> 20:20.709
well, now I know

20:17.709 --> 20:20.709
that I was wrong.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.625
And judging

20:20.750 --> 20:23.625
from his happy tail,

20:23.667 --> 20:25.750
he cares about you too.

20:25.792 --> 20:28.125
This is his new home now.

20:28.166 --> 20:30.208
- Yes.

20:28.166 --> 20:30.208
- Thank you so much, Ms. Dumont!

20:30.250 --> 20:32.667
- Thank you!

20:30.250 --> 20:32.667
- Thank you so much!

20:32.709 --> 20:34.500
- Yes!

20:32.709 --> 20:34.500
- Thank you, Ms. Dumont.

20:34.542 --> 20:37.959
- Oh, you're so welcome.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.166
- I'm really sorry I poked

20:38.000 --> 20:40.166
holes in your painting.

20:40.208 --> 20:41.208
- What?

20:41.250 --> 20:44.041
- Nothing.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.583
- We promise to give

20:44.083 --> 20:46.583
this little guy a good home.

20:46.625 --> 20:48.333
- Oh.

20:48.375 --> 20:50.417
- Maybe we should start

20:48.375 --> 20:50.417
by finally agreeing on his name.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.834
- And no fighting this time.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.709
- How are we gonna do that?

20:58.208 --> 21:02.250
- Veronica Miller,

Channel 6 News,

21:02.291 --> 21:04.834
reporting live

21:02.291 --> 21:04.834
on the final chapter

21:04.875 --> 21:08.291
in our hero dog story.

21:08.333 --> 21:11.917
Yesterday the quibbling quads

21:08.333 --> 21:11.917
couldn't decide on a name.

21:11.959 --> 21:14.834
But today they came to a...

21:14.875 --> 21:17.250
Quad-promise.

21:17.291 --> 21:22.667
They will let the dog decide!

21:22.709 --> 21:24.834
Five bowls, five names,

21:24.875 --> 21:27.875
one decision.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.417
- Okay, buddy.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.667
Go pick your name!

21:31.709 --> 21:35.333
[cheers and applause]

21:50.834 --> 21:53.208
[cheers and applause]

21:56.208 --> 21:59.542
- Ladies and gentlemen,

21:56.208 --> 21:59.542
presenting...

21:59.583 --> 22:01.041
All: Squishy Paws!
