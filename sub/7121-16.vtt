Huh?

00:49.716 --> 00:52.515
You got a lot of meat,
Wildberry Princess.

00:52.585 --> 00:53.609
Yeah, you know.

00:53.686 --> 00:56.087
Thanks for
cook-a-looking for us.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.022
Oh, you're welcome, Finn,

00:58.091 --> 01:01.084
and thank you for answering
my urgent summons.

01:01.161 --> 01:02.094
Hey, yeah.

01:02.162 --> 01:03.562
How can we aid thee?

01:04.531 --> 01:05.897
Oh, it's nothing, really.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.991
Someone's trying to kill me.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.832
Pbbbbbbht!

01:12.105 --> 01:13.004
Still tastes good.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.632
It's no big deal.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.232
Finish your pie.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.972
It <i>is</i> a big deal,
and I demand deets.

01:19.045 --> 01:20.045
Okay.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.139
I'm listening, but I'm
gonna keep eating.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.927
I suspect that I've
been targeted by

01:24.951 --> 01:27.352
the guild of assassins.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.446
Whoa! How do you know?

01:29.522 --> 01:32.981
I found this note stabbed
to my door... man.

01:34.994 --> 01:38.590
Princess, we vow to
protect your juice.

01:38.665 --> 01:39.665
Right, Jake?

01:42.235 --> 01:44.033
Sometimes I think
there's a monster who

01:44.104 --> 01:46.903
lives in my stomach, and that's
why I'm hungry all the time.

01:51.511 --> 01:55.141
Uh... princess, let's continue
this briefing outside.

01:55.215 --> 01:58.049
I can't look at his mouth
when he gets like this.

02:02.322 --> 02:05.952
Mmm!

02:06.025 --> 02:09.792
Princess, want me to
finish off your pie?

02:09.863 --> 02:12.731
Yes, Jake... <i>all</i> my pies.

02:17.537 --> 02:20.132
Hmm?

02:20.206 --> 02:22.607
Hmm.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.203
A tiny cat.

02:25.278 --> 02:26.712
Whoa!

02:27.680 --> 02:29.478
Quiet, or you die!

02:30.517 --> 02:31.541
You're the assassin!

02:31.618 --> 02:34.213
Me-mow... assassin,
second class.

02:34.287 --> 02:37.223
But once I take
out a Princess...

02:37.290 --> 02:40.260
I "gadruate" to full membership!

02:40.326 --> 02:42.591
Well, I'm no Princess, sister!

02:42.662 --> 02:45.564
Yes, I know, but since
you've blown my cover,

02:45.632 --> 02:48.329
<i>you</i> will slay
Wildberry Princess!

02:48.401 --> 02:49.596
What?!

02:49.669 --> 02:51.797
I'd rather be
injected with poison!

02:51.871 --> 02:53.601
Oh. Uh...

02:53.673 --> 02:54.834
Okay.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.103
Um... I mean...

02:56.176 --> 02:58.441
I will assassinate
Wildberry Princess!

02:58.511 --> 02:59.604
Good.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.945
Oh, and if you try to trick
me, I'll poison you.

03:05.552 --> 03:06.952
My nose!

03:07.020 --> 03:09.854
Wow, it's like warm
garbage up in here!

03:09.923 --> 03:12.415
You... you done in there, Jake?

03:12.492 --> 03:14.085
Oh! Uh, yeah!

03:14.160 --> 03:16.823
So, um, Wildberry Princess...

03:16.896 --> 03:20.264
So, maybe it wouldn't be
so bad to be... killed.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.701
W-w-why would you say that?

03:23.770 --> 03:24.863
Dude!

03:24.938 --> 03:26.115
Are you trying to freak her out?

03:26.139 --> 03:27.139
I don't know.

03:27.207 --> 03:28.505
I'm just thinking out loud here.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.134
Are you trying to freak <i>me</i> out?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.770
Aw, I'm sorry, Wildberry Prin...
cess.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.247
Uh, you should... let me...
do something.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.981
And... it will be... good.

03:42.689 --> 03:48.185
What's going on out there?

03:48.261 --> 03:49.388
Take... this!

03:49.462 --> 03:50.555
And... that!

03:50.630 --> 03:51.840
Ooh, how do you like
this, Princess?

03:51.864 --> 03:52.888
Ooh!

03:52.966 --> 03:55.936
Uh, that's... very... good?

03:56.002 --> 03:59.939
I'm gonna pick you up
now and carry you...

04:00.006 --> 04:01.099
to the window!

04:01.174 --> 04:02.073
Jake, what are you...?

04:02.141 --> 04:04.406
No! Stop! Please!

04:10.450 --> 04:13.181
Wildberry Princess is dead!

04:13.253 --> 04:14.253
Shh.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.387
You did it! Well done!

04:18.458 --> 04:20.358
I guess I'll be on my way.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.395
Princess! Oh, princess!

04:22.462 --> 04:23.521
You're alive!

04:23.596 --> 04:27.033
We saw your crown next
to a pile of dirty meat.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.762
Then we slipped on the meat!

04:28.835 --> 04:30.360
And I thought I
tasted your juice.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.337
But it was just blood
from the meat!

04:32.405 --> 04:35.170
We're so glad it
wasn't actually you!

04:36.743 --> 04:37.802
You liar!

04:40.046 --> 04:40.877
Jake?

04:40.947 --> 04:42.347
Okay, Jake.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.441
I've injected you
with <i>half</i> the poison,

04:44.517 --> 04:46.509
and you'll be dead
in 30 minutes,

04:46.586 --> 04:48.145
unless you kill the Princess,

04:48.221 --> 04:50.622
which is when I'll
give you the antidote.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.125
Finn! Help me!

04:53.192 --> 04:54.192
What's wrong?

04:54.260 --> 04:56.729
If you say anything, I'll
stab you in the brain!

04:56.796 --> 04:58.389
Uh...

04:58.464 --> 05:01.298
Finn! Sing mom's lullaby!

05:01.367 --> 05:04.201
I'm so tired, Finn...
from the meat.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.636
Please?

05:05.705 --> 05:07.765
You have to lull me to sleep.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.240
Uh...

05:09.309 --> 05:12.336
I know you carry mom's music
box around in your backpack!

05:12.412 --> 05:14.813
Dude, I'm not gonna sing
mom's lullaby in front of

05:14.881 --> 05:15.974
other people!

05:16.049 --> 05:18.484

06:34.694 --> 06:35.694
Sorry.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.299
Me-mow, still asleep?

06:41.501 --> 06:42.541
Gonna double-cross Jake...

06:43.369 --> 06:44.369
and leave him to die.

Phew!

06:58.284 --> 06:59.980

that antidote...

Aha!

07:04.257 --> 07:06.954
Puppy... hoodies...

07:07.960 --> 07:09.360
I did it.

07:10.329 --> 07:11.991
What the flop, Jake?!

07:13.566 --> 07:15.728
Treachery!

07:15.802 --> 07:17.134
Hyaaaah!

07:17.203 --> 07:18.227
Ooh!

07:18.304 --> 07:19.772
Time's running out, Jake.

07:19.839 --> 07:22.365
Do you want the antidote or not?

07:24.110 --> 07:25.578
What is <i>wrong</i> with you?

07:25.645 --> 07:26.645
Hey, everybody.

07:26.712 --> 07:27.907
Everything's cool.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.278
Everything's <i>not</i> cool!

07:29.348 --> 07:30.907
Wildberry Princess
is still in danger!

07:30.983 --> 07:32.212
Right. Right.

07:33.419 --> 07:35.320
Well, we should take
her somewhere safer.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.789
Do not make me
give you the rest!

07:37.857 --> 07:40.452
I know where to stash
you, Princess.

07:40.526 --> 07:41.960
Follow me!

07:42.028 --> 07:43.052
Ooh.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.830
Here, nobody can
take us by surprise.

07:50.903 --> 07:53.737
Finn, stand here with
your back to the cliff.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.241
I'll stay with W.B.!

07:56.309 --> 07:58.869
Then do what must be done.

08:00.746 --> 08:01.941
Oh, my!

08:02.014 --> 08:04.415
Look at how close
to the edge I am.

08:05.852 --> 08:06.785
Do it, Jake.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.378
Do it!

08:09.522 --> 08:11.115
I... I...

08:11.190 --> 08:15.685
I probably shouldn't!

08:17.363 --> 08:18.456
Ugh!

08:19.465 --> 08:20.558
Jake!

08:20.633 --> 08:22.693

08:22.768 --> 08:24.896
The assassin!

08:24.971 --> 08:26.940
The name's Me-mow.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.874
If you let Jake die, so help
me, I will kill you, too!

08:29.942 --> 08:31.035
Try it, oaf!

08:31.110 --> 08:32.110
Give me the antidote!

08:39.217 --> 08:40.846
Face me, cat!

08:51.163 --> 08:52.163
Ugh!

08:58.771 --> 09:00.706
