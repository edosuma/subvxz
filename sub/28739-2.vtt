<i> Now, once more return</i>
<i>your attention to the breath.</i>

00:42.925 --> 00:45.365
<i>Notice how your breathing continues...</i>

00:47.365 --> 00:49.325
<i>all by itself.</i>

00:58.005 --> 00:59.725
<i>Your mind may wander.</i>

01:01.405 --> 01:03.325
<i>Simply watch it go.</i>

01:06.285 --> 01:07.125
<i>Calmly.</i>

01:09.805 --> 01:11.245
<i>And without judgment.</i>

01:38.605 --> 01:39.605
- Hiya.
- Hi.

01:40.605 --> 01:44.245
God, that was so fast. I didn't realize
you'd be parked right here.

01:44.325 --> 01:47.845
- Yeah, just dropped somebody off.
- Oh, it's my lucky day then.

01:47.925 --> 01:50.685
I'm going to Old Street...
Oh, you've got the details.

01:57.765 --> 01:59.165
So you work in that place?

02:00.205 --> 02:01.205
Hmm?

02:01.645 --> 02:03.965
Sorry, miles away, I didn't catch that.

02:04.045 --> 02:06.445
Is that where you work,
where I picked you up?

02:06.525 --> 02:08.085
At Smithereen? No.

02:09.565 --> 02:10.565
Just visiting.

02:11.405 --> 02:13.325
I mean, I wish I worked there.

02:13.565 --> 02:16.965
The facilities they've got in there,
they've got their own spa. It's madness.

02:18.445 --> 02:20.405
That's Billy Bauer money for you.

02:24.525 --> 02:25.605
Anyway.

03:21.725 --> 03:24.165
My daughter's name
was Kristin

03:24.885 --> 03:25.885
Krissie.

03:26.965 --> 03:29.445
Twenty years old. She was at university.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.205
She killed herself, took her own life,
whatever you wanna call it,

03:35.365 --> 03:36.805
18 months ago now.

03:39.325 --> 03:40.885
And it was out of the blue.

03:42.485 --> 03:44.725
One of her flatmates called me.

03:47.525 --> 03:49.085
They'd found her in the bathroom.

03:52.965 --> 03:54.285
And I'm furious with her!

03:54.365 --> 03:58.565
I'm so fucking angry with her
for not telling me.

03:58.645 --> 04:00.765
I thought I knew, I...

04:02.805 --> 04:04.525
I didn't know.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.725
Last time I spoke, she was happy...

04:08.925 --> 04:11.165
and just like that, she ended everything.

04:12.365 --> 04:14.325
And I don't know why she did it.

04:14.405 --> 04:16.964
I've asked myself why a million times.

04:17.045 --> 04:21.445
Was it over some boy or her course
or the state of the world or me?

04:21.524 --> 04:22.845
Was it something I did?

04:25.925 --> 04:29.285
Round and round in my head
but there's no answer, there's nothing.

04:32.285 --> 04:33.845
She's not here to say, so...

04:36.205 --> 04:37.925
it's never gonna stop, this...

04:39.525 --> 04:41.125
needing to know.

04:41.565 --> 04:43.245
It's never gonna stop.

04:57.285 --> 04:59.045
Talk about nerve-racking.

05:00.245 --> 05:01.525
That was my first time speaking.

05:01.605 --> 05:04.085
I mean, in front of everyone. Tough crowd.

05:04.365 --> 05:05.685
Oh, you did really well.

05:05.765 --> 05:07.045
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.965
First time, though, shit scary, isn't it?

05:10.045 --> 05:11.805
Well, to be honest, I don't know.

05:12.085 --> 05:13.085
Have you...

05:13.405 --> 05:16.485
You haven't spoken while I've been here.
I mean, is it...

05:16.565 --> 05:18.205
I just haven't found the right moment yet.

05:19.045 --> 05:20.445
Waiting for the right moment.

05:23.645 --> 05:27.125
- Anyway.
- Hey, um, do you fancy a drink?

05:28.045 --> 05:30.085
Oh, I've got a bit of a long day tomorrow.

05:30.165 --> 05:32.485
Come on. Might die tomorrow.

05:32.845 --> 05:34.285
Joke.

05:38.685 --> 05:41.245
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

05:44.925 --> 05:48.245
Oh, my God. I needed that.

05:57.765 --> 06:00.205
It's okay. It's okay.

06:01.765 --> 06:04.605
- I wanna make you cum, too.
- In a bit maybe.

06:07.245 --> 06:09.885
- Just need a bit... bit of a breather.
- It's been ages.

06:10.525 --> 06:12.245
Can't even remember the last time.

06:14.925 --> 06:17.005
- Sorry, do you mind if I...?
- No, no, no.

06:18.405 --> 06:20.565
I know these things are undignified.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.725
Went on a date about four months back
with a guy off an app.

06:31.005 --> 06:33.485
Halfway through the starter,
I tell him about Kristin.

06:33.565 --> 06:35.085
He reacted like I said I'd got cancer.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.765
That's her.

06:41.725 --> 06:42.605
Ah.

06:42.685 --> 06:45.805
Her flatmate sent that to me.
It was in her room.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.125
Shit. Okay, give me a minute.

06:52.085 --> 06:55.365
I'm trying
to get into Kristin's Persona account.

06:57.525 --> 07:00.245
I try logging in every day.
It gives you three wrong guesses,

07:00.325 --> 07:01.845
then locks you out for hours.

07:01.925 --> 07:04.125
Every time I think of a guess,
I write it in here.

07:04.205 --> 07:07.325
This week I'm into places
we went on holiday.

07:07.965 --> 07:09.525
I'm her mum. You'd think they'd give me

07:09.605 --> 07:12.005
the password to my own daughter's account,
but, no.

07:13.525 --> 07:15.685
Violates their privacy policy.

07:16.285 --> 07:19.245
They'll memorialize it
if you prove you're next of kin.

07:19.925 --> 07:22.205
Makes it sort of sepia
with a tribute photo,

07:22.285 --> 07:23.605
but that deletes the inbox.

07:23.685 --> 07:25.085
I just want the inbox.

07:25.165 --> 07:27.725
I don't know,
see if there's a reason, an answer.

07:28.245 --> 07:30.245
I don't know what I want. Okay.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.485
Right.

08:05.445 --> 08:06.285
Okay.

08:08.725 --> 08:10.245
Well, there's tomorrow.

08:36.605 --> 08:39.005
<i>Notice how your breathing continues...</i>

08:40.605 --> 08:42.605

08:54.685 --> 08:57.245

09:02.725 --> 09:03.965
I'm on my way now.

09:10.645 --> 09:12.285
Yeah. Uh-huh.

09:13.245 --> 09:17.125
My first-class check-in San Francisco
flight's not for another three hours,

09:17.205 --> 09:18.485
so there should be time.

09:19.645 --> 09:21.565
Yeah, yeah, I'm hopping in the car now.

09:22.965 --> 09:25.285
Okay. Okay, bye.

09:26.565 --> 09:28.965
Uh, uh, airport, yeah?

09:29.045 --> 09:30.165
Terminal Three.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.045
- Do you work in that place?
- Smithereen? Yeah.

10:10.365 --> 10:12.125
The sat nav's showing an accident
coming up.

10:12.205 --> 10:14.805
Do you mind if I follow an alternate route
it's showing me?

10:14.965 --> 10:16.845
It's actually quicker
than the normal way.

10:17.405 --> 10:19.605
- Uh, yeah, that's fine.
- Might be a bit twisty

10:19.685 --> 10:21.925
but this thing always seems to know
what it's doing.

10:22.365 --> 10:23.365
Mm-hmm.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.325
Uh...

11:04.565 --> 11:06.805
Put this on. Put it on.

11:07.565 --> 11:08.565
Put it on!

11:11.245 --> 11:14.085
Round your wrists.
Loop it round your wrists.

11:14.165 --> 11:15.845
- Uh, why are you...
- Just shut up and do it.

11:17.125 --> 11:20.165
- Come on. Pull it tight.
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

11:20.245 --> 11:22.485
Use your teeth. Pull it with your teeth!

11:24.565 --> 11:25.405
- Uh, what...
- Shut up!

11:26.685 --> 11:29.525
Nothing's gonna happen to you
if you just do what I say. Okay?

11:30.885 --> 11:33.405
You're okay. Just do what I say.
Stay there.

11:34.805 --> 11:35.645
Fucking...

11:51.645 --> 11:53.045
Is this about money?

11:53.125 --> 11:55.925
I know I work for Smithereen
but that doesn't mean I've got money!

11:57.045 --> 11:58.925
Don't need to...

11:59.005 --> 12:01.445
What... What are you doing, man?
I'm just an intern.

12:01.525 --> 12:03.125
- What are you doing?
- What did you say?

12:06.045 --> 12:08.165
- What did you say?
- I'm just an intern.

12:11.565 --> 12:15.925
With a suit, the luggage, the... suitcase?
Why are you going to the airport?

12:16.005 --> 12:18.445
It's outfits.
Clothes are in there for Vanessa.

12:18.525 --> 12:20.165
- Who the fuck is Vanessa?
- Vanessa Lampton.

12:20.245 --> 12:21.685
She's an exec at Smithereen.

12:21.765 --> 12:23.685
Her stylist told me
that I need to go to Heathrow.

12:23.765 --> 12:25.845
She's got a bunch of outfits
and she's gotta pick one.

12:25.925 --> 12:28.285
That's my job, man. I'm just an intern.

12:28.365 --> 12:30.245
So why are you dressed like that?
That's a suit.

12:30.325 --> 12:32.845
- You're wearing a fucking suit.
- It's my first week.

12:41.685 --> 12:42.805
Oh, fuck!

12:43.805 --> 12:45.845
Fuck! Fuck!

12:45.925 --> 12:47.645
Okay.

12:47.725 --> 12:48.725
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

12:49.485 --> 12:53.485
Modern fucking companies!
Everyone looks so fucking young!

12:53.565 --> 12:58.525
How is anybody looking in supposed
to have a sense of the fucking hierarchy?!

12:58.605 --> 13:01.885
Jesus Christ! Half of you cunts
coming out of the building

13:01.965 --> 13:03.845
are dressed
like fucking gap-year students.

13:03.925 --> 13:04.925
I mean, what...?

13:05.805 --> 13:07.125
Fuck! Children.

13:07.205 --> 13:08.805
The whole Smithereen building

13:08.885 --> 13:12.605
is a box full of fucking children
getting their fingers everywhere.

13:12.685 --> 13:15.085
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep...
Wiping your shit.

13:15.165 --> 13:18.685
Your fucking app shit up
on everybody's phone.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.245
Everywhere you look,
people are hooked on the things!

13:22.485 --> 13:26.085
It's like chain-smoking. Did you make
a lot of cash out of that, did you?

13:26.165 --> 13:27.685
And you lot are hooked on them as well.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.365
Every single person that comes out
of that building's going...

13:30.445 --> 13:31.845
People don't even look up anymore.

13:31.925 --> 13:35.485
The sky could turn fucking purple
and you cunts wouldn't notice for a month.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.445
You didn't look up
and look where that got you,

13:37.525 --> 13:38.965
sitting in the back like that.

13:44.005 --> 13:48.485
An intern. Why didn't you dress
like a fucking intern?! Jesus!

13:52.285 --> 13:54.925
All right, work with it, work with it.
Work with...

13:55.005 --> 13:56.045
Fuck.

13:58.285 --> 13:59.925
- Stop! Stop!
- Don't kill me.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.565
- I'll shoot you!
- No, no!

14:03.485 --> 14:04.605
Don't move.

14:06.165 --> 14:08.725
- I'm trying to breathe! I'm sorry.
- Shut up.

14:09.885 --> 14:12.325
- I'm sorry. I won't run again.
- Get up, move.

14:12.405 --> 14:14.885
- I won't run. I won't run.
- Move. Shut up!

14:16.005 --> 14:17.885
- Get in. Get in the car.
- Please!

14:17.965 --> 14:19.165
- Get in the car.
- No, no!

14:19.245 --> 14:20.565
- Don't put me...
- Get in!

14:20.765 --> 14:22.685
- Look, I can't go in there.
- Get in, get in.

14:22.765 --> 14:24.845
I can't go in there.
I've got claustrophobia, man.

14:24.925 --> 14:26.885
I'm claustrophobic.
Please, please, please!

14:26.965 --> 14:28.445
- Get in.
- Please don't put me in there.

14:28.525 --> 14:30.565
Just get in. Just do as I say.

14:30.685 --> 14:31.965
- Please.
- Stay fucking quiet.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.885
- All right?
- Please, please, don't put...

14:33.965 --> 14:37.285
No! I can't be in small places!

14:38.085 --> 14:40.045
Please! Please!

14:40.125 --> 14:42.045
- I just can't be in small...
- Oh, fucking hell.

14:42.125 --> 14:44.085
Help! Please.

14:44.165 --> 14:47.165
- Okay. Shut up, shut up, shut up.
- Please, please.

14:47.245 --> 14:48.565
Okay, okay.

14:48.645 --> 14:50.045
Look at me.

14:50.125 --> 14:52.725
You can sit in the back seat
if you put this on and you don't move.

14:52.805 --> 14:55.885
- Okay? Okay?
- I won't, I won't, I won't move.

14:55.965 --> 14:57.445
- Okay.
- Do I have to put it on?

14:57.525 --> 14:58.405
Yeah.

14:59.005 --> 15:00.885
I'll fucking kill you
if you don't keep down.

15:01.885 --> 15:02.885
Fucking hell.

15:05.005 --> 15:05.845
Okay. Lie down.

15:23.405 --> 15:24.885
I'm gonna be sick.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.005
Be quiet. You're okay.

15:28.565 --> 15:30.685
I'm gonna... I'm gonna be sick, please.

15:30.765 --> 15:32.405
- Get down!
- Please, I'm gonna be sick.

15:32.485 --> 15:34.205
- I'm gonna throw up. Please.
- Get down!

15:40.605 --> 15:41.445
What are these?

15:41.525 --> 15:43.245
They didn't have cheese and onion.

15:44.365 --> 15:45.325
Fuck's sake.

15:46.445 --> 15:49.005
- I'm gonna throw up.
- Oh, God! Fucking down or I'll shoot you!

15:53.165 --> 15:55.085
- Did you see that?
- See what?

15:56.125 --> 15:57.525
Something in that car.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.845
It looked like someone
with a bag on their head.

16:02.925 --> 16:03.925
What?

16:04.765 --> 16:05.965
No, let's check it out.

16:15.525 --> 16:16.845
Just get fucking down!

16:27.125 --> 16:30.165
Yeah, look, that one up ahead.
See it? The blue one?

16:30.605 --> 16:33.045
- I can't see anyone in the back.
- I'm sure there was.

16:39.885 --> 16:40.885
Oh, fuck.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.165
Okay.

16:44.845 --> 16:47.045
There you go. Off he goes.

16:51.605 --> 16:53.485
There's fuck all down that way.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.285
Stay down.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.085
Don't fucking move.

17:23.045 --> 17:24.765
- Stay down.
- What's happening?

17:24.845 --> 17:26.005
Just stay down.

17:34.805 --> 17:38.605
Whiskey, Lima, six, zero,
Hotel, Foxtrot, X-ray.

17:38.685 --> 17:40.125
<i> Control, received.</i>

17:40.765 --> 17:44.765
- He's not getting out.
- No. He's gonna be a runner.

17:46.925 --> 17:49.245
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.

18:03.485 --> 18:05.885
<i> Control,</i>
<i>in pursuit of vehicle registration...</i>

18:10.325 --> 18:13.085
What's happening? What's...

18:14.005 --> 18:15.405
Jesus fucking Christ.

18:33.805 --> 18:34.685
Oh, my God. Oh, fuck!

18:52.165 --> 18:53.005
Stay down.

18:55.605 --> 18:56.805
- Out of the car!
- Boys!

18:56.885 --> 18:58.685
- Stay back!
- Out of the car now!

18:59.605 --> 19:01.045
- Out of the car!
- I've got a gun!

19:01.125 --> 19:03.605
- Help!
- I'll shoot him. I've got a gun.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.165
I'll shoot him in the face!

19:05.725 --> 19:08.285
Get back! Move further back! Move back!

19:09.005 --> 19:11.805
- Get back. Back.
- Get in the car! Move your car right back!

19:12.725 --> 19:14.165
- Move your car back!
- Status zero.

19:14.245 --> 19:16.925
- I'll shoot him in the face!
- Armed suspect. Hostage taken.

19:17.005 --> 19:19.645
Get behind the car. Heads down.
Leave the bikes. Over here.

19:19.725 --> 19:20.765
I'll fucking shoot him!

19:23.005 --> 19:25.445
Stay down. Stay down.

19:26.125 --> 19:29.645
Since she left, you won't, please, don't.
Please, whatever you want, don't...

19:29.725 --> 19:30.685
Shh! Shh!

19:31.765 --> 19:35.085
Heads down, heads down,
stay behind the car. Stay low.

19:43.765 --> 19:44.965
I need to think.

19:57.365 --> 19:59.245
- Lads, go home.
- My bike's down there.

19:59.325 --> 20:01.605
Lads, go home! Go!

20:04.965 --> 20:07.245
- Wait. What?
- We can get the bikes later.

20:07.325 --> 20:09.925
<i>Reference, Sierra Juliet,</i>
<i>other patrols are en route.</i>

20:10.005 --> 20:13.085
Sierra Juliet, received. What's he doing?

20:13.165 --> 20:14.925
I don't know. He's just sitting there.

20:52.045 --> 20:53.165
Billy Bauer.

20:54.445 --> 20:56.285
I want to speak to Billy Bauer.

20:56.525 --> 20:57.765
Your boss.

20:59.245 --> 21:01.085
I know who he is but I don't know him.

21:01.165 --> 21:02.445
I'm just an intern, remember?

21:02.525 --> 21:05.125
- I know, I know.
- He's probably in America or...

21:05.205 --> 21:07.485
Look, how do I...
I don't know Billy Bauer.

21:07.565 --> 21:08.965
I know, I know you don't know him,

21:09.045 --> 21:11.645
but you'll know someone
who knows someone who knows him.

21:11.805 --> 21:14.125
- From your company.
- I've only been there one week.

21:14.205 --> 21:15.845
I don't even know anyone's name.

21:15.925 --> 21:18.165
Okay, so who's the highest-ranking person
that you do know?

21:18.245 --> 21:19.245
Uh, Hannah.

21:20.085 --> 21:23.765
Yeah, Hannah Kent in HR.
She's sort of in charge of me.

21:23.845 --> 21:26.565
Okay. Okay. Hannah Kent in HR.

21:26.645 --> 21:29.485
- So can you phone her?
- What?

21:29.685 --> 21:32.605
- Have you got her number in your phone?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

21:33.525 --> 21:34.525
So can I have it?

21:34.605 --> 21:36.125
Your phone, where's your phone?

21:39.405 --> 21:40.845
It's in the other car.

21:48.605 --> 21:50.005
<i> Control 535C...</i>

21:50.085 --> 21:52.325
- Fucking hell.
<i>- Status update.</i>

22:00.165 --> 22:02.045
Can you remember, um...

22:05.285 --> 22:08.645
The HR woman, Hannah,
can you remember her number?

22:11.325 --> 22:12.965
- What's her number?
- Um, I don't know.

22:13.045 --> 22:15.205
I'd tell you,
I'd totally tell you if I knew it.

22:15.285 --> 22:17.285
Would Hannah recognize your voice
on the phone?

22:17.365 --> 22:19.925
- Yeah, probably, yeah.
- Right, so you could call reception

22:20.005 --> 22:21.845
or the front desk or whatever,
ask for Hannah?

22:21.925 --> 22:23.925
I don't know.
I've never had to do that yet.

22:24.005 --> 22:25.765
- That's okay.
- But I don't have my phone.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.005
I've got one. I've got one.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.205
Don't fucking try anything.

22:33.605 --> 22:35.005
I'm not gonna try anything.

22:41.845 --> 22:43.285
Uh, what's the number for reception?

22:43.365 --> 22:44.445
I don't know.

22:44.525 --> 22:46.605
- I've never had to do that.
- Fuck it. I'll Google it.

23:09.325 --> 23:13.165
- You see the gun?
- Yeah, automatic. Yeah, it looked real.

23:16.285 --> 23:18.045
Over there, over there.

23:30.565 --> 23:32.285
Smithereen London,
how can I help you today?

23:32.365 --> 23:35.125
<i>Hannah?</i>
<i>Hi, can I speak to Hannah, please?</i>

23:35.205 --> 23:37.525
Hannah Kent? From HR?

23:37.605 --> 23:39.445
<i>- Putting you through.</i>
- Thank you.

23:40.445 --> 23:43.045
When she answers, say you're in a car
and there's a man with a gun,

23:43.125 --> 23:45.365
he's gonna shoot you
unless he speaks to Billy Bauer. Okay?

23:46.085 --> 23:47.085
Okay.

23:58.805 --> 24:01.565
<i>This is Hannah Kent at Smithereen.</i>
<i>I'm not at my desk right now.</i>

24:01.645 --> 24:03.365
<i>Leave a message and I'll get back to you,</i>

24:03.445 --> 24:06.325
<i>or if it's urgent,</i>
<i>you can reach me on 07700...</i>

24:06.405 --> 24:08.525
- Should I talk to her voicemail?
- Shut up.

24:08.605 --> 24:13.845
<i>That's 07700900866.</i>

24:13.925 --> 24:16.485
07700900866...

24:17.405 --> 24:18.725
- There you go.
- Thank you.

24:22.405 --> 24:24.445
- Hello?
- Hannah?

24:24.525 --> 24:26.885
Uh, Mrs. Kent, it's, uh, Jaden.

24:26.965 --> 24:30.485
What... What, are you at the airport?
You've not found Vanessa?

24:30.565 --> 24:33.205
<i>No, no, no, listen.</i>
<i>I'm in a car with a man</i>

24:33.285 --> 24:36.085
<i>and he's got a gun</i>
<i>and he needs to speak to Billy Bauer.</i>

24:36.845 --> 24:40.085
<i>- Hello? He needs to speak to Billy Bauer.</i>
- Who needs to speak to Billy Bauer?

24:40.165 --> 24:41.565
The man does, the gunman.

24:41.645 --> 24:44.245
Okay, Jaden,
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:44.325 --> 24:47.085
Can you slow down?
I don't understand what...

24:47.165 --> 24:49.525
- Look, I'm...
- Listen carefully. I've got a gun.

24:49.605 --> 24:51.605
I've got your employee.
And I'm going to shoot him

24:51.685 --> 24:56.045
unless you get me Billy Bauer
on the phone right now. I'm serious.

24:56.125 --> 24:58.085
The police are here.
They're looking at me.

24:58.165 --> 25:00.525
I'm stuck here, I've got a fucking gun.
There's not much time.

25:00.605 --> 25:03.125
I didn't want to do it like this
but I need to speak to Bauer now.

25:03.205 --> 25:05.485
Okay. Is this a joke?

25:05.565 --> 25:07.005
- No.
- No!

25:10.085 --> 25:11.605
I think he just took a photo.

25:17.125 --> 25:17.965
<i>Did you get that?</i>

25:18.605 --> 25:19.445
Yes.

25:20.445 --> 25:22.725
<i>- That's your guy Jaden, yeah?</i>
- Yes.

25:24.165 --> 25:25.565
Don't hurt him.

25:25.645 --> 25:27.885
<i>If you get me Billy Bauer on the phone,</i>
<i>no one gets hurt.</i>

25:27.965 --> 25:31.125
I just wanna speak with Billy Bauer on...
on the phone.

25:32.125 --> 25:36.525
- Okay, I don't know how to get to Billy.
<i>- But you can find out.</i>

25:36.765 --> 25:38.005
I can try to.

25:38.085 --> 25:40.445
Can you stay on the line?

25:40.525 --> 25:41.405
Now.

25:41.485 --> 25:43.885
Oh, I'm staying on the line.

26:00.205 --> 26:02.525
- You sure it's not a prank?
- I can't be a hundred percent,

26:02.605 --> 26:05.325
but I don't wanna call the US
if this is bullshit.

26:07.285 --> 26:09.165
It's still bloody morning over there.

26:14.805 --> 26:15.805
Oh, God.

26:24.205 --> 26:26.845
Hey, Maryam, this is early even for you.

26:28.525 --> 26:29.485
Uh-huh.

26:31.445 --> 26:32.325
Uh-huh.

26:38.445 --> 26:39.725
Holy shit.

26:42.605 --> 26:43.685
Okay.

26:47.165 --> 26:49.685
Have Don and Shonelle meet me
in the boardroom in ten.

27:36.885 --> 27:38.245
Here comes the hotstepper.

27:44.685 --> 27:46.645
- Get a cordon going.
- Come on, lads.

27:50.565 --> 27:53.765
- Did you get a look at the hostage yet?
- Yeah. Hood's off, he's in the back.

27:53.845 --> 27:55.525
Early twenties, by the looks of him.

27:56.045 --> 27:59.365
- This is David Gilkes, negotiator.
- Either of you speak to the suspect?

27:59.445 --> 28:01.045
For like a second when he pulled the gun.

28:01.125 --> 28:04.005
- He seem pissed up? On something?
- No, just angry.

28:09.525 --> 28:11.325
Let's cut back on the razzmatazz.

28:12.845 --> 28:15.285
I know it's tense
but we're not risking a shit storm

28:15.365 --> 28:18.365
like the whole Stretton thing
with poor old Mr. Starter Pistol.

28:18.525 --> 28:20.245
- Ma'am, I...
- Yes, I know but he was unarmed

28:20.325 --> 28:22.925
and it was less than a month ago.
Memories aren't that short yet.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.605
So no critical shot

28:24.685 --> 28:26.525
unless there's absolutely no choice.

28:26.605 --> 28:27.925
- Okay?
- Ma'am.

28:29.165 --> 28:32.005
- Your lace is undone.
- Ma'am, they've ID'd the car.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.085
It's registered
to an Eleanor Kathleen Gillhaney,

28:34.165 --> 28:38.205
sixty-seven years old,
listed under an address in Ewelme.

28:38.285 --> 28:40.525
- That's, what, couple of miles from here?
- Yeah.

28:40.605 --> 28:43.685
- I know Ewelme.
- Okay, you two go and give it a knock.

28:43.965 --> 28:45.565
- See if she's okay.
- Yes, ma'am.

28:46.805 --> 28:48.965
Ma'am,
I'm gonna get these cars out of the way.

28:50.085 --> 28:50.925
Right.

29:02.965 --> 29:04.965
Pen, we have to tell Billy
what's happening.

29:06.845 --> 29:08.485
If this thing ends in a shoot-out,

29:08.565 --> 29:10.645
he should at least be aware
of the situation.

29:10.725 --> 29:12.805
- Got a hit.
- He could start making other demands.

29:12.885 --> 29:15.885
- One moment, Don. What is it?
- Okay, the cell he's calling from,

29:15.965 --> 29:17.805
I ran it through everything
and got a match.

29:17.885 --> 29:21.165
It's registered as a two-step
verification number on this account.

29:24.165 --> 29:26.805
Pull out whatever we can get on this guy.
He's still on hold, right?

29:26.885 --> 29:28.325
Got him listening to a playlist.

29:31.165 --> 29:33.645

He doesn't even know who I am.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.645
We know who the hostage is.
He's from Smithereen.

30:15.725 --> 30:18.845
- The social whatever company?
- Yeah. They contacted the Met

30:18.925 --> 30:21.645
to say one of their interns
is being held at gunpoint.

30:21.925 --> 30:24.725
Jaden Tommins. The gunman sent a photo.

30:28.965 --> 30:29.965
Shit.

30:30.725 --> 30:33.565
He'd been sent on an errand.
They booked a cab through the Hitcher app.

30:33.645 --> 30:36.405
He's not in a cab now. Call Hitcher,
get what we can on the driver.

30:36.485 --> 30:38.445
- We got the number that sent that photo?
- Yep.

30:38.525 --> 30:40.685
Run the call data through intel.
What did he say to them?

30:40.765 --> 30:42.765
- Did he give a name?
- He wouldn't tell them anything

30:42.845 --> 30:46.165
but he did say he needs to speak
to Billy Bauer on the phone.

30:47.125 --> 30:49.365
Billy Bauer as in Billy Bauer?

30:55.685 --> 30:57.645
- <i> Hello.</i>
- I'm here.

30:59.245 --> 31:01.205
<i>This is Penelope Wu from Smithereen.</i>

31:01.285 --> 31:03.645
<i>I understand</i>
<i>you've asked to speak with Mr. Bauer.</i>

31:04.605 --> 31:06.845
That's right.
So have you got Billy Bauer on the line?

31:08.365 --> 31:10.525
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Sorry. Uh, yes.

31:10.605 --> 31:12.565
We're doing everything we can.

31:13.445 --> 31:15.005
May I speak to Jaden?

31:16.245 --> 31:18.965
- He's fine.
- I just need to check he's okay.

31:19.765 --> 31:22.045
- Tell them you're okay.
- Uh, I'm okay.

31:22.125 --> 31:24.645
There. So you'd better hurry up
and get Billy Bauer on the phone.

31:24.725 --> 31:26.325
<i>It's still very early where he is.</i>

31:26.405 --> 31:29.205
<i>- We're having difficulty reaching him.</i>
- That's not my problem.

31:30.045 --> 31:32.725
Well, meantime could you maybe outline
what this is regarding?

31:32.805 --> 31:34.645
<i>No. I'm only speaking to him.</i>

31:35.485 --> 31:39.445
Sure, it's just... I'm actually the COO.

31:39.525 --> 31:41.285
Okay. And?

31:41.365 --> 31:43.925
<i>Well, it might be quicker</i>
<i>if I can present him with a...</i>

31:44.005 --> 31:46.485
Just fucking get Billy Bauer
on the phone right now.

31:46.565 --> 31:47.925
I'm not fucking around here.

31:48.005 --> 31:49.285
<i>I will blow his fucking head off!</i>

31:49.365 --> 31:52.365
<i>- Do you understand?</i>
- I'm sorry, of course, I apologize.

31:52.445 --> 31:55.325
I'm gonna put you back on hold.
I promise you we are working on it.

31:55.405 --> 31:56.765
Don't be long!

32:01.725 --> 32:02.725
Well, he's not stable.

32:02.805 --> 32:04.245
Oh, in what way, Don?

32:04.325 --> 32:05.885
Jesus Christ.

32:07.565 --> 32:09.245
I don't think that music helped him any.

32:09.325 --> 32:12.085
But I switched the line
so now while he's hearing that,

32:12.205 --> 32:14.205
we can listen in
to see what's happening at his end.

He moved in when she died.

34:40.885 --> 34:42.525
Well, couple of months at any rate.

34:42.605 --> 34:44.764
- On his own?
- Yeah, keeps to himself.

34:45.045 --> 34:48.725
Drives to work each morning,
think he works somewhere in London.

34:49.445 --> 34:50.645
Has something happened to him?

34:51.284 --> 34:54.405
Got a positive ID on the suspect.
Name's Christopher Gillhaney.

34:54.485 --> 34:55.525
Okay.

34:55.605 --> 34:57.485
<i>He seems to be staying</i>
<i>at his late mum's place.</i>

34:57.565 --> 35:00.445
<i>Lots of red bills,</i>
<i>and it's up for repossession.</i>

35:00.525 --> 35:01.965
What have you got on the suspect?

35:02.045 --> 35:03.165
Former teacher.

35:03.245 --> 35:06.805
<i>- Sorry? He's a teacher?</i>
- Well, he was a teacher. IT.

35:06.885 --> 35:09.845
<i>He's been registered unemployed</i>
<i>going on two years.</i>

35:09.925 --> 35:12.965
- How's his record?
<i>- Fully DBS checked, he's squeaky clean.</i>

35:13.045 --> 35:15.205
Only place he shows up is as a victim

35:15.805 --> 35:18.845
<i>in a road traffic accident,</i>
<i>November 2015.</i>

35:18.925 --> 35:22.685
Drunk driver plowed right into him.
Two dead, including the drunk.

35:22.765 --> 35:24.845
- Okay, good work, Najma.
<i>- Ma'am.</i>

35:26.645 --> 35:28.005
Teacher with a real gun?

35:28.645 --> 35:33.005
- Not impossible, but not likely.
- Ma'am, it's the FBI.

35:34.805 --> 35:37.565
- What?
- It's the FBI. Urgent call.

35:41.525 --> 35:43.085
Chief Superintendent Grace.

35:43.885 --> 35:47.765
Hi, Chief Superintendent.
This is Ernesto Cruz from the FBI.

35:48.725 --> 35:50.485
Right. Sorry, what's this regarding?

35:50.565 --> 35:53.845
We're liaising with Smithereen,
Silicon Valley. They're also on this call.

35:53.925 --> 35:56.005
What, they're on the line as well?

35:56.085 --> 35:58.565
Yes, hi,
this is Penelope Wu from Smithereen.

35:58.645 --> 36:01.085
With me is Don from legal
and Shonelle from analytics.

36:01.605 --> 36:03.565
Uh, David Gilkes, negotiator.

36:03.645 --> 36:06.205
Listen, Ms. Wu,
we've identified the suspect.

36:06.285 --> 36:08.805
<i>Christopher Michael Gillhaney,</i>
<i>former schoolteacher,</i>

36:08.885 --> 36:12.165
thirty-three years old.
He has a Smithereen profile.

36:12.245 --> 36:14.805
<i>- Right.</i>
<i>- So first off, Christopher's on hold</i>

36:14.885 --> 36:17.045
but we are able to listen in
to his end of the line

36:17.125 --> 36:19.245
so we'll share live feed of that
with you guys.

36:19.325 --> 36:20.885
Yeah. That's useful.

36:20.965 --> 36:23.565
<i>In addition, we figure</i>
<i>we could share the data we have on him</i>

36:23.645 --> 36:25.925
<i>to assist negotiations at your end,</i>
<i>but first,</i>

36:26.045 --> 36:29.165
perhaps you could share with us
your perception of what he's doing.

36:29.245 --> 36:32.805
Probably extortion, whether it's targeted
at your company is something we don't...

36:32.885 --> 36:34.405
Oh, it's targeted.

36:35.565 --> 36:37.765
- Sorry?
<i>- We're looking into who Christopher is.</i>

36:37.845 --> 36:41.085
Group-wise we'd slot him
into high intellect, low income.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.925
Often angry people.

36:43.005 --> 36:44.925
<i>Right, well, we checked to see</i>

36:45.005 --> 36:48.165
if he'd ever expressed hostile sentiments
towards Smithereen as an entity

36:48.245 --> 36:50.045
but nothing shows up on his social.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.285
In fact, there's been nothing there at all
for some time.

36:52.365 --> 36:55.565
<i>- His whole account is dormant.</i>
- I don't see how this is relevant.

36:55.645 --> 36:57.885
<i>But then we checked in</i>
<i>with the Hitcher guys.</i>

36:58.165 --> 37:00.365
- Right.
<i>- So the cab that picked Jaden up</i>

37:00.445 --> 37:03.285
is registered to an Omar Masimbalu.

37:03.405 --> 37:05.565
<i>And a name like that,</i>
<i>I think you'll agree,</i>

37:05.645 --> 37:07.805
<i>does not exactly match Mr. Gillhaney.</i>

37:08.085 --> 37:11.125
- No.
<i>- Turns out it was a compromised account.</i>

37:11.205 --> 37:12.685
People trade them on the dark web.

37:12.765 --> 37:14.925
Seems likely Chris got a hold of it
that way.

37:19.765 --> 37:21.165
You appreciate what I'm saying?

37:22.005 --> 37:24.205
- He's been covering his tracks.
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

37:24.285 --> 37:27.605
<i>So we asked Hitcher</i>
<i>to share his account activity</i>

37:27.685 --> 37:29.365
<i>and it seems for weeks,</i>

37:29.445 --> 37:31.525
he'd been only accepting jobs

37:31.605 --> 37:35.165
specifically outside
the Smithereen London address.

37:35.245 --> 37:38.325
Just parked up each day waiting
until he got a job from someone

37:38.405 --> 37:39.525
<i>inside the building.</i>

37:39.605 --> 37:42.085
<i>This... This is a whole plan</i>
<i>he's had going on here.</i>

37:42.165 --> 37:45.045
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>this is sophisticated criminal behavior.</i>

37:45.125 --> 37:46.365
<i>I find it hard to believe</i>

37:46.445 --> 37:48.165
<i>he's never raised red flags before.</i>

37:48.245 --> 37:50.085
His record's totally clean.

37:50.165 --> 37:53.845
- I mean, he was the victim in...
<i>- The auto accident in 2015.</i>

37:53.925 --> 37:56.925
He lost his fiancée in that crash.
Were you aware of that?

37:59.885 --> 38:00.725
No.

38:02.005 --> 38:03.005
But you are.

38:03.085 --> 38:05.045
<i>There were historical posts</i>
<i>inside his network,</i>

38:05.125 --> 38:09.165
condolences, memorials,
and that's when Chris disengages, in fact,

38:09.245 --> 38:12.645
not interacting with friends
even though he's expressing grief.

38:13.645 --> 38:14.765
You've done your homework.

38:14.845 --> 38:16.645
Okay, I'm thinking this isn't about money.

38:16.725 --> 38:18.765
- <i> David.</i>
- Go on.

38:18.845 --> 38:21.005
Chris is about the same age as Bauer,
right?

38:21.085 --> 38:23.205
They've both got geeky backgrounds,
computers.

38:23.285 --> 38:26.885
- David.
- Maybe even Chris thinks it's about money

38:26.965 --> 38:29.485
but it's actually about status.

38:30.325 --> 38:32.925
Bauer's got money, power, respect.

38:33.005 --> 38:35.885
<i>What's Christopher got? He's skint.</i>
<i>He's driving a hookie cab.</i>

38:35.965 --> 38:38.285
<i>He's just lost his fiancée,</i>
<i>his mum as well.</i>

38:38.485 --> 38:41.645
What if Christopher
thinks he wants what Bauer's got?

38:44.005 --> 38:46.245
But really,
it's just about getting his attention.

38:47.365 --> 38:48.885
What if that's what's going on?

38:51.725 --> 38:53.925
Is that gonna help you
talk him out of that car?

38:57.605 --> 38:59.085
If he'll listen to me, yeah.

39:05.245 --> 39:07.165
Christopher!

39:12.005 --> 39:13.325
Hello, Christopher?

39:15.125 --> 39:17.725
Christopher, my name is David Gilkes.

39:18.365 --> 39:19.765
I'm David, okay?

39:20.565 --> 39:23.605
If you can see me, I'm the berk
waving his arm in the air, okay?

39:23.685 --> 39:25.365
The one in the cheap suit.

39:26.645 --> 39:29.645
Listen,
there's a whole load of police here

39:29.725 --> 39:32.445
and to be honest,
they're just doing their jobs

39:32.525 --> 39:35.885
but I think they're worried you're gonna
hurt yourself or someone else.

39:36.805 --> 39:40.605
I don't think you will, Christopher,
but I'm not sure that they think that.

39:40.685 --> 39:42.085
You know how they get.

39:48.925 --> 39:52.365
- Chris, that's me calling you, Chris.
- Oh, leave me alone.

39:52.685 --> 39:54.285
I just wanna talk to you for a moment.

39:54.965 --> 39:56.965
<i>Harris, if we need you,</i>
<i>you got a clear shot?</i>

39:57.525 --> 40:01.125
No clear shot yet.
Hostage is directly behind the gunman.

40:05.325 --> 40:06.365
Can you shut up, please?

40:07.845 --> 40:09.045
, can you hand me that?

40:09.525 --> 40:11.485
<i>Chris, I know you're pretty stressed</i>
<i>at the moment.</i>

40:11.565 --> 40:14.245
- <i> Are you the negotiator?</i>
- My name is David...

40:14.325 --> 40:16.165
Thanks for that, David.
Are you the negotiator?

40:17.325 --> 40:21.245
Well, some people call me that,
but really I'm just a...

40:21.325 --> 40:24.045
I've read up about negotiators.
You'll pretend to be my friend

40:24.125 --> 40:27.685
and then you'll slowly try to convince me
to give myself up.

40:28.485 --> 40:30.765
Chris, you're obviously a smart guy
so I won't bullsh...

40:30.845 --> 40:34.365
And if gentle persuasion doesn't work,
you'll keep me distracted on the phone

40:34.445 --> 40:36.805
long enough for one of your snipers
to get a good head shot.

40:36.885 --> 40:37.725
Is that right, David?

40:38.685 --> 40:40.565
Well, look, let's just try to...

40:40.645 --> 40:42.925
No, no, let's just you fuck off.

40:43.005 --> 40:44.765
Get off the line.
I'm waiting for Billy Bauer.

40:48.405 --> 40:51.485
Okay,
you're the guy in the cheap suit, yeah?

40:51.565 --> 40:53.445
- That's what you said?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

40:53.525 --> 40:55.005
Okay, so here's what's gonna happen.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.565
I'm gonna count to a hundred.

40:57.445 --> 40:59.365
- Chris.
<i>- Okay. I'm gonna count to 50.</i>

40:59.445 --> 41:03.045
And if I don't see you get in your car
and fuck off right away,

41:03.125 --> 41:04.725
I'll blow his fucking head off!

41:04.805 --> 41:07.405
<i>- Chris, we don't need to do like that.</i>
- One, two...

41:07.485 --> 41:09.005
<i>Harris, have you got a shot?</i>

41:09.085 --> 41:11.445
- No, if I shoot, I'll kill them both.
- four, five...

41:12.205 --> 41:16.525
- six, seven, eight, nine...
- He's bluffing.

41:16.605 --> 41:18.925
David, we can't risk it.
You know we can't.

41:19.005 --> 41:22.885
I will blow his fucking head off. 12, 13,

41:22.965 --> 41:24.125
- 14...
- Fucking shift then.

41:24.205 --> 41:26.405
15, 16...

41:26.485 --> 41:30.765
- David, I'm ordering you to go.
- 17, 18, 19, 20...

41:30.845 --> 41:33.005
- Keys. Who's got the fucking keys?!
- 21,

41:33.085 --> 41:36.045
22, 23, 24,

41:36.485 --> 41:38.965
- 25, 26...
- That's it, keep going.

41:39.045 --> 41:43.725
- Give me a clear shot.
- 27, 28, 29, 30,

41:43.805 --> 41:45.525
- 31, 32.
- Chris, he's going.

41:45.605 --> 41:47.285
- He's gone.
<i>- Good.</i>

41:47.365 --> 41:49.445
No one gets hurt if I get my call.

41:50.445 --> 41:51.845
Don't call this number again.

41:56.805 --> 41:59.165
- Stop shifting about.
- Sorry, I've got cramp.

41:59.765 --> 42:01.005
Fucker.

42:03.245 --> 42:04.885
<i> I'm hearing from the British cops</i>

42:04.965 --> 42:07.165
<i>he's failed to engage</i>
<i>with their negotiator.</i>

42:07.365 --> 42:09.325
Agent Cruz,
could you give us a moment please?

42:10.285 --> 42:12.645
Sure. Yep.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.925
We have to tell Billy what's happening.

42:18.005 --> 42:20.925
Billy's not here, okay?
I can't just call him up.

42:21.605 --> 42:22.685
Where is he?

42:23.525 --> 42:27.125
He's six days
into a ten-day silent retreat.

42:28.005 --> 42:29.845
- A silent retreat?
- Just him alone,

42:29.925 --> 42:31.805
not speaking to anyone, total isolation.

42:31.885 --> 42:35.485
He's done tech detox weekends
here and there, but ten days.

42:35.565 --> 42:38.245
And I'm very reluctant to step into that.

42:39.045 --> 42:41.245
But you do know where he is, right?

42:41.325 --> 42:43.845
Well, he doesn't know it
but of course I do.

43:26.045 --> 43:27.165
Mr. Bauer?

43:28.805 --> 43:29.765
Hello?

43:32.285 --> 43:33.285
Hello?

43:45.325 --> 43:46.325
Mr. Bauer?

43:57.645 --> 44:01.045
I'm so sorry to interrupt

44:01.125 --> 44:03.525
but there's a situation
you need to know about.

44:05.565 --> 44:09.405
Someone in the United Kingdom
has taken one of our interns hostage

44:09.565 --> 44:12.925
and they're threatening to kill him
unless they can speak to you on the phone.

44:25.525 --> 44:26.725
Oh, fuck.

44:32.845 --> 44:36.085
And he nearly hit us and then, he just
crashed into that field over there.

44:36.165 --> 44:37.525
That's when they shouted, "Gun."

44:49.005 --> 44:50.405
Stay back, ladies and gents.

45:05.565 --> 45:08.445

45:35.365 --> 45:38.565
- Or a boyfriend? Partner? Whatever?
- Not at the moment.

46:04.725 --> 46:08.165
You know, if you give yourself in,
they might go easy on you.

46:09.005 --> 46:10.685
I can't do that.

What do you do
if he asks for a million dollars?

46:56.125 --> 46:57.125
<i>Tell him he can have it.</i>

46:59.045 --> 47:01.685
- We cannot give money...
<i>- I'm not talking about giving him money.</i>

47:01.765 --> 47:03.685
I'm talking about buying us
some more time.

47:04.165 --> 47:06.765
The moment any kind of transaction
gets mentioned...

47:06.845 --> 47:09.925
Jesus, fuck the fucking money! Holy shit!

47:12.765 --> 47:14.685
To be blunt, Mr. Bauer, for all we know,

47:14.765 --> 47:16.845
this guy's planning
on executing the hostage

47:16.925 --> 47:18.525
the moment he has you on the line.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.085
I don't get that feeling.

47:25.845 --> 47:28.685
I don't think
we can trust feelings on this.

47:31.085 --> 47:33.325
Well, maybe that's part of the problem.

47:44.845 --> 47:46.005
I wanna talk to him.

47:47.405 --> 47:49.125
They've got a news van as well.

47:53.005 --> 47:54.885
My mum will be terrified.

47:55.445 --> 47:58.245
She worries about me all the time
and this is...

47:58.325 --> 48:00.245
Your mum's got nothing to worry about.

48:01.405 --> 48:03.125
- Yes, she does, she...
- It's not real.

48:04.085 --> 48:05.325
The gun, it's not real.

48:07.645 --> 48:09.565
- What?
<i>- It's a replica.</i>

48:09.645 --> 48:11.765
- Fuck!
- Stand by, stand by.

48:11.845 --> 48:14.125
We don't wanna spook him.
We want him getting bored.

48:14.205 --> 48:15.525
Ma'am. It's not real.

48:15.605 --> 48:17.165
- What?
- His gun, he's just told Jaden

48:17.245 --> 48:18.525
it's not real, it's a replica.

48:18.605 --> 48:20.605
Guys, I've just been told
the gun's not real.

48:20.685 --> 48:22.525
The gun's not real.
We heard that at our end.

48:22.605 --> 48:24.805
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

48:24.885 --> 48:27.605
We'll deal with him now,
if you'll excuse me.

48:27.685 --> 48:28.565
Thank you.

48:28.645 --> 48:30.685
- Simon, I'll need a vest.
- Ma'am?

48:31.885 --> 48:35.285
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't move.
Don't try to get out.

48:36.165 --> 48:38.685
I've got the child lock on
and they've got real guns out there.

48:38.765 --> 48:41.885
We start struggling about,
they could hit either one of us.

48:42.005 --> 48:45.565
Billy, this is a live feed
from the gunman's cell.

48:46.165 --> 48:49.125
<i>- He can't hear you, okay?</i>
- Okay, uh...

48:49.525 --> 48:52.005
<i>- Patch his phone through.</i>
- Jesus. Okay.

48:52.085 --> 48:54.965
- <i> At least untie my hands.</i>
<i>-  Listen, I can't do it yet.</i>

48:55.045 --> 48:57.885
<i>Just got to make them believe it</i>
<i>a little bit longer, all right?</i>

48:58.205 --> 48:59.165
<i>Until I speak to Bauer.</i>

49:00.805 --> 49:02.245
Looks like the gun is not real.

49:02.965 --> 49:04.925
<i>We just heard him tell the hostage</i>
<i>it's a replica.</i>

49:05.005 --> 49:06.525
<i>He was spinning the wheel.</i>

49:07.285 --> 49:09.405
- What did he say?
- Well, it's not a real gun.

49:09.485 --> 49:12.125
<i>All units,</i>
<i>weapon is a non-firing replica...</i>

49:17.805 --> 49:19.845

49:21.445 --> 49:25.165
<i>♪ But if you feel like I feel ♪</i>

49:25.245 --> 49:28.085
<i>♪ Please let me know that is real ♪</i>

49:37.125 --> 49:39.285
Uh, someone's coming, someone's coming.

49:45.805 --> 49:46.805
What the fuck...?

50:03.645 --> 50:06.325
The gun is real! Get back! Get back!

50:06.405 --> 50:09.165
- The gun is real!
- Got a clear view for critical shot.

50:09.245 --> 50:12.685
- Get back over there!
- Chris, we need to stop this now.

50:12.765 --> 50:15.445
It'll stop when I speak to Billy Bauer!

50:15.525 --> 50:17.125
- Then it'll stop!
- He's in America.

50:18.005 --> 50:19.965
They can't contact him yet.

50:20.325 --> 50:23.485
Fuck off. They must have told him by now.
You're just biding time.

50:23.565 --> 50:26.365
No one's biding time.
We're taking this all very seriously.

50:26.845 --> 50:28.405
Now why don't you let Jade...

50:30.125 --> 50:31.725
Shot authorized.

50:31.805 --> 50:33.125
Ah!

50:33.205 --> 50:36.045
Fuck! Can't see.
No clear view for a critical shot.

50:36.125 --> 50:38.165
Everyone back behind cover, now.

50:41.485 --> 50:43.325
You're okay. You're okay.

50:46.525 --> 50:49.365
You are listening in, so listen to this.

50:49.445 --> 50:51.845
<i>He only fucking clipped me.</i>
<i>I'm still here.</i>

50:52.565 --> 50:56.165
<i>If you don't phone back with Billy Bauer</i>
<i>in the next five minutes,</i>

50:56.325 --> 50:57.485
<i>it all kicks off.</i>

50:57.605 --> 50:59.805
<i>I mean it. I am hanging up this phone</i>

50:59.885 --> 51:03.325
<i>and if you don't call me back</i>
<i>within the next five minutes,</i>

51:03.405 --> 51:05.205
I'm fucking doing it.

51:05.285 --> 51:08.285
That's final. Okay? It's final.

51:14.405 --> 51:15.885
I lied about the gun.

51:18.965 --> 51:19.805
I'm sorry.

51:25.725 --> 51:29.325
- Pen? Pen, are you still there?
<i>- Bill, I'm here.</i>

51:29.405 --> 51:31.205
Put me through.
Put me through to this guy.

51:31.285 --> 51:32.925
Sir, you... you can't do that.

51:33.005 --> 51:35.405
Excuse me, please don't tell me
what I can and can't do, okay?

51:35.485 --> 51:38.245
<i>- Mr. Bauer, this is an extortion attempt.</i>
- Pen, cut him off.

51:38.325 --> 51:40.765
<i>- Cut Agent FBI Douchebag off.</i>
- Billy...

51:40.845 --> 51:42.405
<i> In the strongest possible terms,</i>

51:42.485 --> 51:44.605
I suggest you do not engage
with this individual.

51:44.685 --> 51:46.365
- Cut him off now!
- Bill, don't...

51:49.165 --> 51:50.725
All right, Pen, give me his number.

51:51.885 --> 51:53.365
- Bill.
<i>- We got his number?</i>

51:53.445 --> 51:54.965
<i>What's his name? Uh...</i>

51:55.285 --> 51:57.365
<i>Christopher Gillhaney?</i>
<i>Give me his number.</i>

51:57.445 --> 51:58.845
Bill, I'm not gonna give you that.

52:00.445 --> 52:03.845
Did everyone catch the same disease today?
I didn't ask you.

52:03.925 --> 52:06.205
<i>You cannot expose yourself to that.</i>

52:06.605 --> 52:08.525
Uh... My laptop in there?

52:08.605 --> 52:09.645
<i>- Bill?</i>
- Yeah.

52:09.725 --> 52:11.405
- And a sat link?
- Yes.

52:12.365 --> 52:13.445
Fuck it. I'll get it myself.

52:13.525 --> 52:14.765
<i>- Bill.</i>
- Peace.

52:14.845 --> 52:15.845
Bill.

52:32.085 --> 52:34.445
Uh, what did Penelope say?
Can you make a note for me?

52:35.125 --> 52:37.165
Christopher Michael Gillhaney.

52:40.645 --> 52:43.445
- Christopher Michael Gillhaney.
- UK,

52:44.085 --> 52:46.885
user since '08,
didn't log on for 18 months.

52:46.965 --> 52:47.965
Uh-huh.

52:50.365 --> 52:51.645
Sorry, what's your name?

52:52.485 --> 52:53.405
Tipi.

52:53.485 --> 52:54.925
Hi, I'm Billy.

52:55.965 --> 52:57.365
Oh.

52:57.445 --> 53:00.965
Tipi, really the only good thing
about my position

53:01.245 --> 53:03.085
is every once in a while
I get to invoke...

53:04.245 --> 53:05.165
God-mode.

53:29.205 --> 53:32.045
<i> Christopher? Is that Christopher?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

53:32.885 --> 53:33.885
Yeah, I'm here.

53:35.085 --> 53:36.045
It's me.

53:38.685 --> 53:39.525
<i>Hi.</i>

53:40.285 --> 53:41.565
<i>I'm Billy Bauer.</i>

53:43.565 --> 53:46.805
<i>- You wanted to talk to me?</i>
- I did. I did, yeah. I do.

53:48.165 --> 53:51.125
Okay, well, uh... you got me on the line.

53:52.365 --> 53:57.125
Tell you what, why don't you let
our guy Jaden there go and, uh...

53:58.005 --> 53:59.845
<i>you and I can just, you know, chat?</i>

53:59.925 --> 54:02.805
<i>We can talk about...</i>
<i>whatever it is you want.</i>

54:02.965 --> 54:05.645
- If I let him go, you'll hang up.
- I'm not gonna hang up, Christopher.

54:05.725 --> 54:08.085
<i>- I want you to listen to me!</i>
- I'm listening.

54:08.165 --> 54:11.285
Let's just not... blow up, okay?

54:12.085 --> 54:14.565
Let's just, you know, be calm

54:15.405 --> 54:18.245
<i>and you'll just kind of tell me</i>
<i>what it is that you want.</i>

54:18.325 --> 54:20.685
I just told you.
I want you to listen to me.

54:20.765 --> 54:23.885
<i>- Just fucking listen to me.</i>
- I'm listening.

54:29.485 --> 54:30.685
There's no one else here.

54:31.685 --> 54:34.485
Okay, Chris? It's just... it's you and me.

54:38.565 --> 54:39.645
<i>You have my attention.</i>

54:45.525 --> 54:47.085
- Chris?
<i>- Yeah, I'm just...</i>

54:48.045 --> 54:50.285
<i>I'm just...</i>
<i>it's hard to get my thoughts in order.</i>

54:50.365 --> 54:52.405
I've rehearsed this though, and I just...

54:52.485 --> 54:54.325
<i>That's okay. Take your time, man. Just...</i>

54:55.965 --> 54:57.165
<i>Take your time.</i>

54:58.085 --> 54:59.125
You run Smithereen.

54:59.605 --> 55:00.765
Uh-huh.

55:01.125 --> 55:02.365
Since 2008.

55:03.005 --> 55:04.965
<i>I used to use Smithereen all the time.</i>

55:06.325 --> 55:08.565
- Okay.
<i>- I mean, constantly.</i>

55:09.045 --> 55:11.325
<i>Like, my phone was glued to my hand.</i>

55:12.765 --> 55:14.605
I was the whole cliché, you know,

55:14.965 --> 55:17.805
first thing I saw in the morning,
last thing I saw at night.

55:22.205 --> 55:23.285
Tamsin was...

55:28.285 --> 55:30.285
<i>Chris? I'm here.</i>

55:31.845 --> 55:34.645
Tamsin was the same. She was my fiancée.

55:39.165 --> 55:40.365
Three years ago...

55:42.725 --> 55:44.485
I was driving home with her.

55:44.805 --> 55:46.245
We'd been visiting my mum.

55:47.165 --> 55:50.045
My mum was sick
and we'd been visiting my mum

55:50.125 --> 55:53.165
and I was driving Tamsin back to our flat.

55:55.485 --> 55:56.325
She was asleep.

56:02.205 --> 56:04.285
<i>She was tired</i>
<i>and I'm just driving her home.</i>

56:06.165 --> 56:07.885
<i>And it was boring.</i>

56:10.365 --> 56:11.685
<i>I got bored.</i>

56:13.005 --> 56:16.005
<i>I got bored every ten seconds back then,</i>
<i>I think,</i>

56:16.085 --> 56:19.645
<i>and I'm on this A road.</i>

56:21.085 --> 56:23.245
<i>It was very quiet, straight...</i>

56:24.005 --> 56:26.205
<i>And my phone lights up and I check it.</i>

56:28.405 --> 56:30.045
<i>I just glanced at it, you know.</i>

56:30.845 --> 56:35.165
There's this little notification thing
saying someone liked a comment

56:35.245 --> 56:37.685
that I made about some photo of theirs.

56:38.805 --> 56:40.685
I just glanced at it, you know.

56:45.565 --> 56:47.005
That's all the time it took.

57:12.085 --> 57:13.445
It took her two months to die.

57:15.245 --> 57:17.725
I was at her bedside. It was no use.

57:19.565 --> 57:21.285
The man in the other car died, too.

57:23.365 --> 57:27.045
<i>He was drunk. He got the blame.</i>
<i>They said it was him.</i>

57:28.005 --> 57:30.285
Everyone felt sorry for me. Mr. Tragic.

57:31.565 --> 57:33.005
Even her parents.

57:36.965 --> 57:39.565
At her funeral, you know,
her mum was comforting me.

57:40.245 --> 57:41.605
Her fucking mum.

57:43.285 --> 57:44.485
What could I say to her?

57:44.685 --> 57:47.765
Nobody wants to hear
that their daughter's dead

57:47.845 --> 57:50.445
because I was looking at me fucking phone.

57:52.205 --> 57:55.885
<i>Afterwards, everyone tried to get me</i>
<i>to go to grief counseling.</i>

57:55.965 --> 57:57.525
- It's Pen.
<i>- Talk about it.</i>

57:57.605 --> 57:59.365
<i>Just say... say how you feel.</i>

58:02.565 --> 58:03.565
<i>And I'm thinking...</i>

58:05.485 --> 58:07.045
<i>I can't say a fucking thing.</i>

58:07.925 --> 58:10.965
Because how I feel
is that I fucking killed her.

58:16.285 --> 58:17.285
I killed her.

58:21.685 --> 58:22.965
Me.

58:25.045 --> 58:28.525
I killed her over a fucking... dog photo.

58:31.125 --> 58:32.565
I killed her over that.

58:40.565 --> 58:41.605
I hear you.

58:44.125 --> 58:45.125
What?

58:45.365 --> 58:48.445
<i>I said... "I hear you."</i>

58:49.325 --> 58:50.565
Of course you fucking hear me.

58:53.245 --> 58:54.765
You sound like you're in a lot of pain.

58:54.845 --> 58:58.405
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!
Speak like a fucking human being!

58:59.045 --> 59:00.845
You said you hear me so fucking hear me.

59:00.925 --> 59:03.805
I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
They gave me bullshit advice.

59:03.885 --> 59:06.005
- Fucking talking points.
<i>- Talking points.</i>

59:06.085 --> 59:07.405
<i>- Fucking hell.</i>
- I know.

59:08.685 --> 59:09.965
Fuck! I'm...

59:19.965 --> 59:21.325
I don't know what to say to you.

59:22.965 --> 59:23.885
Okay?

59:25.325 --> 59:26.525
That's the truth.

59:28.285 --> 59:30.965
I don't know what to say.
I don't know what you want me to say.

59:31.885 --> 59:33.205
I know it was me.

59:35.485 --> 59:37.645
It was me. I was driving. It was my fault.

59:38.845 --> 59:41.645
<i>I never told anyone before</i>
<i>because what good would that do,</i>

59:41.725 --> 59:46.765
or I could write it all down
and leave a... a note, shoot myself,

59:46.845 --> 59:48.445
but what good would that do?

59:49.845 --> 59:51.525
But I thought I could tell you.

59:52.445 --> 59:53.885
If I could get you to listen.

59:55.565 --> 59:57.245
<i>It was your thing, you built it.</i>

59:58.765 --> 01:00:01.485
I heard that that you make these things
that way.

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:03.605
Addictive.

01:00:04.445 --> 01:00:07.445
<i>So that you can't take your eyes</i>
<i>off them.</i>

01:00:10.445 --> 01:00:11.605
Well, job done.

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:16.485
Bit of user feedback for you there.

01:00:17.565 --> 01:00:20.205
Maybe factor that into your next update.

01:00:21.485 --> 01:00:24.565
I'm so sorry about your girl.

01:00:25.725 --> 01:00:27.245
Truly. I'm, uh...

01:00:31.925 --> 01:00:33.685
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

01:00:35.085 --> 01:00:36.605
Our whole platform, I swear to God.

01:00:36.685 --> 01:00:40.965
It was... like, it was one thing
when I started it

01:00:41.045 --> 01:00:43.445
and then it just... I don't know,

01:00:43.525 --> 01:00:46.925
it just became
this whole other fucking thing.

01:00:48.485 --> 01:00:50.965
<i>I mean, it got there by degrees,</i>
<i>you know, they said...</i>

01:00:52.085 --> 01:00:55.085
<i>"Bill, you gotta keep optimizing,</i>
<i>you gotta keep people engaged."</i>

01:00:55.165 --> 01:00:57.805
Until it was more like a crack pipe.

01:00:57.885 --> 01:01:01.045
It was like
some kind of fucking Vegas casino where...

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:03.685
And we'd sealed off all the fucking doors.

01:01:03.765 --> 01:01:07.405
They've got a department... All they do
is tweak it like that on purpose.

01:01:07.485 --> 01:01:10.525
They've got dopamine targets
and there's nothing I can do to stop it.

01:01:10.605 --> 01:01:13.805
I started it. There's nothing I can do
to fucking stop it.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:18.045
I'm like some kind of...
fucking bullshit front-man now.

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:25.725
I swear to God, I've been on this retreat,
supposed to be for ten days...

01:01:25.805 --> 01:01:27.325
After, like, day two,

01:01:27.405 --> 01:01:29.085
<i>- I decided, fuck it.</i>
- Hey.

01:01:29.165 --> 01:01:31.285
<i>- I quit Smithereen. That's it, I'm out.</i>
- Hey. Shut up!

01:01:31.365 --> 01:01:32.805
- No way I'm...
<i>- Shut up.</i>

01:01:32.885 --> 01:01:34.685
<i>I don't give a fuck what you do now.</i>

01:01:34.765 --> 01:01:38.965
Beat yourself up or fucking run
a victory lap, I don't care.

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:43.885
I just wanted to say my piece.

01:01:48.405 --> 01:01:49.805
<i>I'm gonna go now.</i>

01:01:50.365 --> 01:01:51.445
Chris...

01:01:54.365 --> 01:01:55.645
you gonna let our guy go?

01:01:55.725 --> 01:01:58.085
- Of course I am.
<i>- Oh, thank God.</i>

01:01:59.125 --> 01:02:01.885
I'm going to. I always was, all along.

01:02:04.565 --> 01:02:05.805
And now I'm out of here.

01:02:07.645 --> 01:02:09.925
<i>Wait, Chris, um, out of here</i>

01:02:10.045 --> 01:02:12.205
- as in...
<i>- As in out of here.</i>

01:02:12.285 --> 01:02:14.805
<i>- What do you think I fucking mean?</i>
- No. No, what? Don't...

01:02:16.005 --> 01:02:17.445
You don't have to do that.

01:02:17.965 --> 01:02:19.485
<i>Chris, you do not have to do that.</i>

01:02:19.565 --> 01:02:22.805
I can't stay here,
not after what I did to her.

01:02:22.885 --> 01:02:25.565
- I have to.
<i>- No, you don't have to do anything!</i>

01:02:25.645 --> 01:02:27.405
You don't have to waste your life.

01:02:29.925 --> 01:02:31.045
It is wasted.

01:02:35.765 --> 01:02:38.565
If there's anything that I can do, Chris,

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.725
<i>you gotta give me a shot here, okay?</i>

01:02:41.805 --> 01:02:45.045
There's gotta be something that I can do,
even if it's something small.

01:02:46.445 --> 01:02:49.565
There's gotta be one small thing
that I can do for you.

01:02:49.645 --> 01:02:51.045
<i>Please, Chris, just...</i>

01:02:52.525 --> 01:02:54.685
<i>Chris, anything.</i>

01:03:07.085 --> 01:03:09.165
Do you know the guy who owns Persona?

01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:13.645
Yeah, I know Curtis. Sure.

01:03:25.365 --> 01:03:27.285
- Hello?
<i>- Hayley Blackwood?</i>

01:03:27.605 --> 01:03:28.765
Speaking.

01:03:29.045 --> 01:03:31.485
<i>I'm calling from Persona</i>
<i>in San Francisco.</i>

01:03:31.565 --> 01:03:34.205
<i>I've been asked</i>
<i>to pass on some information to you.</i>

01:03:35.165 --> 01:03:36.005
You have?

01:03:40.805 --> 01:03:42.085
He's spoken to him.

01:03:58.645 --> 01:04:01.565
I'm gonna let you go now, Jaden. Okay?

01:04:04.045 --> 01:04:04.965
Thanks.

01:04:09.485 --> 01:04:10.645
You can get up.

01:04:12.085 --> 01:04:14.885
Careful, careful.
No sudden movements now.

01:04:14.965 --> 01:04:16.645
We don't wanna spook them, okay?

01:04:21.245 --> 01:04:22.565
Hold out your wrists.

01:04:24.765 --> 01:04:25.845
He's cutting him free.

01:04:39.205 --> 01:04:41.245
I'm sorry
for putting you through all of this.

01:04:45.045 --> 01:04:47.045
It's okay.

01:05:07.765 --> 01:05:09.845
Come on, come on, what's taking...

01:05:11.045 --> 01:05:12.725
Don't kill yourself, man.

01:05:17.765 --> 01:05:22.205
Seriously, my uncle killed hisself
and it fucked my whole family up.

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:25.205
My mum's still a mess.
I'll go out there right now

01:05:25.285 --> 01:05:28.405
and then I'll tell all of them,
I'll tell them that you didn't hurt me.

01:05:28.485 --> 01:05:30.845
That's very good of you.
That's very kind of you.

01:05:31.405 --> 01:05:33.485
But I don't wanna be here anymore.

01:05:38.965 --> 01:05:40.685
I won't do it
until you're away from the car.

01:05:40.765 --> 01:05:43.965
- Seriously, you don't wanna do this...
- I know you mean well,

01:05:44.045 --> 01:05:46.725
but, please,
just please get out of the car.

01:05:47.525 --> 01:05:48.445
Please.

01:05:50.405 --> 01:05:52.965
Oh, I can't get out the car,
you left the child lock on.

01:06:01.285 --> 01:06:03.645
Oh, no, no, no. Please, don't.

01:06:03.725 --> 01:06:05.685
- Just leave me to it.
- You don't have to do this!

01:06:05.765 --> 01:06:07.725
They're struggling.
Have you got a clear shot?

01:06:09.405 --> 01:06:10.245
Affirmative.

01:06:12.005 --> 01:06:13.285
Shot authorized.

01:06:24.205 --> 01:06:25.685
Fuck.

01:06:49.205 --> 01:06:51.165
Fuck.

01:06:51.685 --> 01:06:54.405
- Just drop it, man!
- No.

01:06:54.485 --> 01:06:55.565
Target missed.

01:06:56.725 --> 01:06:57.925
