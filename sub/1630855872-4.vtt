WEBVTT

01:00.478 --> 01:02.188
Hey, Jang Tae-chun.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.982
How dare you bring this to light
without reporting it to me?

01:05.608 --> 01:09.528
Actually, Mr. Hwang
suddenly called for me, and--

01:09.612 --> 01:12.656
You little bastard. Hey!

01:12.740 --> 01:13.908
Great work.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.536
Thanks to you,
our department's reputation has improved.

01:17.620 --> 01:21.040
That bastard, Hwang Gi-seok,
is great at sly things like this.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.793
Man, that sneaky son of a bitch.

01:24.794 --> 01:27.004
Will you be questioning Kim Seong-tae
this morning?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.924
At least he turned himself in.
So don't be too harsh on him.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.468
I won't summon him.

01:32.551 --> 01:35.721
I have everything I need anyway.
Plus I've got a pile of other cases.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.809
I bet Gi-seok is going to treat you
to a feast.

01:39.892 --> 01:41.352
Keep up the good work.

01:42.228 --> 01:43.437
Goodbye, sir.

01:43.521 --> 01:44.563
Oh, Mr. Nam.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.732
-Good morning.
-Yes, good morning.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.239
Have you decided to accept
Mr. Hwang's drink?

02:08.462 --> 02:09.547
Mr. Nam.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.215
Yes?

02:11.298 --> 02:13.217
If a rookie like me captures
Chairman Myeong,

02:13.300 --> 02:15.302
the loan shark king,
it'd be unbelievable, right?

02:20.182 --> 02:21.350
Only if you get him.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.021
-If you fail, you'll die.
-I'm aware.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.443
I'm too young to die, you know.

02:38.742 --> 02:42.246
I'm going to step out for a bit.
Meeting at 9:00 about Chairman Myeong.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.925
Work with me.

02:56.552 --> 03:01.557
I'll make you the most powerful prosecutor
in the country.

03:05.311 --> 03:06.312
Come on.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.696
Careful.

03:26.457 --> 03:27.458
Wow!

03:28.083 --> 03:31.879
Only when you're standing up this high
can you see far ahead

03:33.130 --> 03:34.673
and broaden your horizons.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.467
Got it?

03:39.887 --> 03:40.888
So,

03:42.556 --> 03:46.268
what's your plan with Major Park?

03:49.146 --> 03:51.023
The law serves no purpose for them.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.194
Doing time in prison
will only affect their health.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.573
If they still have everything
even after they get released,

04:00.324 --> 04:02.451
this cycle will just repeat itself.

04:04.411 --> 04:08.999
We need to take away what Chairman Myeong
cherishes more than his life: money.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.670
As for Hwang Gi-seok,
we'll take away his power.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.842
Connecting them to CEO Oh
won't be enough to make that happen.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.555
I'm a businessman.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.059
My weapon is money, not the law.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.520
Money?

04:29.603 --> 04:30.604
Money.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.858
I'm going to buy the entire
prosecution service of South Korea.

04:34.942 --> 04:35.943
You hear me?

04:44.410 --> 04:45.536
This feels great!

05:16.483 --> 05:17.609
ATTACHED FILE
JANG TAE-CHUN

05:21.238 --> 05:22.865
SEND

05:33.751 --> 05:35.461
Hey, Jang Tae-chun!

05:35.544 --> 05:38.213
-I just sent it.
-Okay.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.383
All right. Great.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.054
Let's see.

05:48.265 --> 05:51.226
You know leaking confidential information
is illegal, right?

05:51.310 --> 05:54.813
Of course.
All investments come with a risk.

05:55.481 --> 05:58.150
I'm risking my life here, not my money.

05:58.776 --> 06:01.904
I don't need deposit guarantees.
Just make sure you get results.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.281
Hey, Tae-chun--

06:06.408 --> 06:08.368
He sure does take after me.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.331
All right.

06:33.811 --> 06:36.063
Hello, Mr. Oh. Nice to meet you.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.856
Yes, nice to meet you too.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.193
The view here is amazing.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.988
I thought it'd be best to talk
in a relaxed environment.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.825
Of course. I've had it rough lately,
so this is great.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.118
Please take a seat.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.331
My name is Eun Yong.
I'm in the moneylending business.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.415
Ah, yes.

06:57.668 --> 07:01.004
I was trained under
Chairman Myeong In-ju in the past.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.841
Yes, I've heard a lot about you.

07:03.924 --> 07:08.011
You're the only one that extorted money
from Chairman Myeong in Myeong-dong.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.807
Yeah, we go way back.

07:12.641 --> 07:17.437
I'm sure you know about my relationship
with Chairman Myeong, so why call me here?

07:19.481 --> 07:24.153
I want to invest in your company
instead of Chairman Myeong.

07:24.987 --> 07:28.907
If I want to do business in Korea, isn't
it critical to have connections like you?

07:30.909 --> 07:33.287
Gosh, I'm flattered by your words.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.582
But loyalty is of great value to me.

07:36.665 --> 07:38.625
You've had two elections
since you retired.

07:38.709 --> 07:41.170
But Chairman Myeong
couldn't make you a congressman.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.882
I think you have a better chance with me.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.801
He's over the hill now.
So cut your ties with that old fox

07:49.219 --> 07:50.679
and accept my offer.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.975
There are tons of rich people out there.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.770
But you know who Chairman Myeong's
son-in-law is, right?

07:59.479 --> 08:02.733
You mean Chief Hwang Gi-seok?
The so-called Chef Hwang?

08:02.816 --> 08:04.026
Yes, you're right.

08:04.109 --> 08:08.614
I know I trained him,
but he's going to make it big.

08:13.410 --> 08:15.454
Take a look at this.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.374
STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

08:21.460 --> 08:25.172
This is a document you signed saying
you earned cash from stock manipulation.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.966
I got it from Dongdaemun.

08:30.636 --> 08:34.014
So? Are you trying to
blackmail me with this?

08:34.097 --> 08:37.643
What do you mean by blackmail?
I'm proposing an investment.

08:38.227 --> 08:40.354
How dare you try to fool me?

08:43.357 --> 08:44.983
Hey, you loan shark.

08:45.067 --> 08:49.029
You think you are on par with me
because you have some money?

08:50.364 --> 08:54.284
You should've brought gifts
if you wanted to build connections.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.328
How dare you shove this in my face?

09:01.500 --> 09:05.921
I wonder what will happen
if this goes into Chef Hwang's hands.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.632
What if this cripples his success?

09:09.591 --> 09:11.426
With what he can cook up,

09:12.427 --> 09:15.180
I'm sure he'll boil you in hot water.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.563
For your sake, I'm safely keeping
evidence from the prosecution.

09:24.481 --> 09:26.733
We'll just call it collateral
for our trust.

09:27.442 --> 09:31.446
And I think you misunderstood me.
I asked you to meet me today

09:31.530 --> 09:34.199
not because I wanted to beg
for your connections

09:35.158 --> 09:37.244
but because I want to buy them.

09:38.537 --> 09:39.830
Buy my connections?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.915
What will you do with them?

09:42.874 --> 09:45.335
With investment comes restructuring.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.212
I'm sure you're feeling uneasy

09:48.630 --> 09:50.799
because the dog you trained
has grown too big.

09:53.719 --> 09:55.971
They won't budge that easily.

09:57.806 --> 10:01.018
Chairman Myeong and his son-in-law
committed a crime together.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.939
Current GMI Bank, former Bluenet.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.275
Do you remember CEO Yoon?

10:08.358 --> 10:11.695
There's nothing you can do
with a past incident.

10:11.778 --> 10:16.491
That case has been closed
with CEO Yoon's death.

10:16.575 --> 10:20.078
The accomplice is still here
to reveal the truth.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.372
An accomplice?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.292
Come in.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.760
I'm Park Joon-gyeong.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.734
CERTIFICATE OF ENTRY & EXIT

10:51.943 --> 10:54.821
I've contacted the immigration office
at the airport,

10:54.905 --> 10:58.950
and it turns out that he recently flew in
on a private plane from Mongolia.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.745
He has a private plane?

11:06.708 --> 11:08.293
My father-in-law was right.

11:14.049 --> 11:17.177
-Who's the girl next to him?
-Her real name is Hong Han-na.

11:17.260 --> 11:20.472
In the capital market, she's known
as Butterfly Hong or Teacher Hong.

11:20.555 --> 11:23.475
-A butterfly?
-No, not a butterfly in the wild.

11:23.558 --> 11:25.644
She's the "social butterfly" Hong.

11:26.561 --> 11:30.065
She has global and domestic connections
to the financial and political world.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.151
She's also the co-owner of the hedge fund
Eun Yong runs.

11:33.235 --> 11:34.945
She manages the investors.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.407
But there's never any return without risk.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.701
Why would a global hedge fund owner
come to Korea?

11:41.785 --> 11:44.162
If you want, we can call her in and ask.

11:44.246 --> 11:47.124
I'm sure we can find something
in her foreign exchange records.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.627
No, no. It would look suspicious
if we make the first move.

11:58.468 --> 12:01.221
Put me through to Director Choi
from Financial Supervisory Service.

12:01.304 --> 12:06.476
Minimizing risk. Wouldn't you agree
this is the role of a hedge fund?

12:06.560 --> 12:11.982
Are you sure? I hear that the investment
is to Korea and not Mongolian real estate.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.985
Where did he hear that news?

12:20.323 --> 12:22.534
Don't you think that profits matter?

12:22.617 --> 12:24.619
I'll be back here on the payment dates

12:24.703 --> 12:28.165
with a large amount of money
to make you happy.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.749
Inshallah.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.713
These good-for-nothing rich wimps.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.674
They keep whining like little kids.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.553
You have the campaign funds
for CEO Oh all prepared, right?

12:41.636 --> 12:45.640
I've been making excuses in six different
languages because of that.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.018
Oh, a very good job.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.606
-How did it go with CEO Oh?
-Yeah.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.816
How is he as a person?

12:56.526 --> 13:00.238
Decent. He's quite ambitious.
But he's also a coward.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.785
-You saw the files I sent you, right?
-No. What is it?

13:05.869 --> 13:09.039
Information from the prosecution
acquired by seize-and-search.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.715
What the-- Damn it!

13:19.299 --> 13:20.467
Goddamn it!

13:20.967 --> 13:25.680
Are you unaware of the consequences
if I get caught with these files on my PC?

13:26.264 --> 13:27.724
Trying to put us out of business?

13:27.807 --> 13:30.936
We're giving money to CEO Oh
so he can stop that from happening.

13:31.019 --> 13:33.563
Isn't this how you do business in Korea?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.859
Take a look.
The information on there is all money.

13:39.027 --> 13:42.864
You found something that's worth something
in here while all this was happening?

13:42.948 --> 13:45.867
Isn't money the only thing that moves
those like you, me, Chairman Myeong,

13:45.951 --> 13:48.119
and everyone else in the capital market?

13:51.748 --> 13:54.334
Come on. Just take a look. Please?

14:19.317 --> 14:22.153
Will CEO Oh take care of
the core members of the prosecution?

14:22.696 --> 14:23.697
Yes.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.742
Is your friend Eun Yong
a person you can trust?

14:30.328 --> 14:31.371
He's family.

14:33.248 --> 14:36.042
We will finalize everything
with the party leader this evening.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.546
If the investigation starts
after you turn yourself in,

14:39.629 --> 14:42.424
the party will initiate their attack too.

14:44.134 --> 14:47.262
-Okay.
-There's no turning back after that.

14:48.305 --> 14:51.391
There's no limit as to what kind
of dirty tricks they'll play on you.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.728
My military uniform
probably can't protect me this time.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.896
Even If they find a tiny flaw,

14:56.980 --> 15:00.317
Hwang Gi-seok will stab me to death
with the power he wields.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.027
If you are willing to stop here--

15:02.110 --> 15:04.404
Revealing the truth,
punishing the culprit.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.449
My mom always told me

15:08.491 --> 15:12.203
those two things never happened,
although she protested with all her might.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.792
I'm going to do it right this time.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.056
If your mom were here,
she'd never forgive me.

15:32.974 --> 15:33.975
No.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.061
I'm sure…

15:37.687 --> 15:39.189
Mom would've supported us.

15:49.616 --> 15:53.453
The chairman of the board wants to see you
after the reception.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.833
It's about the rebate case in the Seoul
western prosecutors' office.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.669
The accused won't be in custody.

16:00.752 --> 16:01.920
Good job.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.464
Your father told you, right?

16:05.256 --> 16:07.300
He's going to delist GMI Bank

16:07.384 --> 16:09.761
and transfer your shares
to Myeongin Holdings.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.138
Yes, I heard. Attorney Lee dropped by.

16:12.764 --> 16:16.267
I'll transfer more shares
under our kids' names this time.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.188
It's better to come into an inheritance
when they are younger.

16:21.815 --> 16:22.941
Sounds good.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.820
When should I arrange a meal

16:26.903 --> 16:29.906
with the young prosecutor
you took the picture with?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.409
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun?

16:33.451 --> 16:34.828
He's out.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.623
Have you heard of someone named Eun Yong?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.418
He used to work for your father.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.503
Manager Eun?

16:45.046 --> 16:47.298
Prosecutor Jang is his nephew.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.927
Those two were going behind my back.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.513
He was up to no good, so I cut him off.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.393
Manager Eun came back to Korea?

17:01.229 --> 17:02.564
Are you close with him?

17:05.734 --> 17:09.028
He's toxic in many ways.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.949
You won't see him again.

17:17.912 --> 17:21.124
You should trim your sides.

17:22.459 --> 17:23.585
Should I?

17:23.668 --> 17:26.921
You shouldn't wear a tie for your next
briefing on Assemblyman Baek.

17:28.965 --> 17:32.802
Everyone keeps an eye on the color
of the tie right before an election.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.231
How was your meeting with Minister Son?

18:27.357 --> 18:28.566
What's all this?

18:38.493 --> 18:41.746
It's nice and neat, right?
I did some cleaning.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.710
You're not alone anymore.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.047
Let's eat.

18:57.512 --> 18:59.347
Wow. Looks good.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.350
This is called khorkhog.

19:02.433 --> 19:06.271
It's Mongolian cuisine,
and it goes so well with kimchi.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.608
Here. Try some.

19:17.240 --> 19:18.700
Back in Mongolia,

19:19.409 --> 19:21.369
you'd cook this with a wild rat,

19:21.452 --> 19:23.830
but finding a wild rat in Korea
wasn't easy.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.082
I had to jump through hoops to get this.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.879
So I made this with beef.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.673
The meat is Hanwoo from Hoengseong.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.843
No need to worry. Just dig in.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.891
Gosh, this is delicious.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.898
-It's a bit salty.
-It's supposed to be salty.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.610
Your mom taught me how to cook.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.279
Want to drink some soju?

20:04.287 --> 20:05.663
It's been a while.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.001
Gosh, this is good.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.548
Why didn't my mom leave me any messages
before her death?

20:16.174 --> 20:18.635
She left one for Minister Son.

20:21.012 --> 20:23.640
She must not have wanted to
burden you any longer.

20:24.974 --> 20:28.728
I understand her,
but it makes me bitter at times.

20:28.811 --> 20:32.148
Ms. Yoon always felt sorry for you.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.651
-My mom?
-Yeah.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.611
That's not true.

20:36.694 --> 20:40.281
She always said I was dull and reserved.
That made her disappointed.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.034
That's why she adored you.

20:43.117 --> 20:46.412
You made her laugh
and got the house all rowdy.

20:48.539 --> 20:51.334
They say family and close friends
don't know each other well.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.628
You and your mom are just like that.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.930
But still, it's your birthday.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.933
I said I'd buy you something good.
You even said no to seaweed soup.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.559
-You always want this soup.
-I mean it.

21:08.643 --> 21:11.854
Your soup is the best of the best.
This soup is magical.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.816
It's salty, but so delicious.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.567
It's the best!

21:19.278 --> 21:20.863
Thank you for the food.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.537
Gosh. Salty and delicious.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.957
It'd be great if Joon-gyeong
eats well like you do.

21:31.040 --> 21:34.210
Tell me about it. I'm much better
than your daughter, aren't I?

21:34.293 --> 21:37.797
Definitely not.
No matter what, my daughter is the best.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.639
I'm always sorry and thankful.

21:47.724 --> 21:52.145
Her dad passed away when she was young,
so she matured very early on.

21:52.228 --> 21:54.188
I hoped she'd stay as my baby girl.

21:58.192 --> 22:00.445
I'm sorry to talk about this
when you're alone.

22:01.112 --> 22:04.032
Not at all. You made me realize something.

22:05.283 --> 22:08.619
I realized my parents would've felt
the same way as you.

22:10.580 --> 22:11.748
Thank you!

22:12.999 --> 22:17.086
I think Ms. Yoon hoped that
you'd live a relaxed and happy life

22:17.920 --> 22:20.256
without trying too hard.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.511
What are your plans after this job?

22:26.763 --> 22:28.431
-My plans?
-Yeah.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.266
Nothing on your mind, right?

22:30.933 --> 22:33.561
Gosh, you're still such a big nerd.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.354
For starters,

22:35.438 --> 22:38.274
you should travel around
and have some fun.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.902
I've been to many countries,
so I know the best places.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.445
Have you been to Mongolia?

22:42.528 --> 22:46.574
Words can't describe the stars
in the night sky in Mongolia.

22:46.657 --> 22:50.411
It's incredible. It literally looks like
the stars are falling from the sky.

22:51.329 --> 22:53.206
No, wait a minute.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.249
Iceland is great too.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.586
The northern lights there are amazing.

22:58.669 --> 23:01.589
It's unbelievable.
Actually, you should go to Switzerland.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.884
Eating instant noodles while enjoying

23:05.468 --> 23:07.929
the snowy landscape of the Alps
is also fantastic.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.348
Anyway, I'll let you use my private plane,

23:11.057 --> 23:12.225
so you can go wherever.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.853
-Will you be okay?
-Of course.

23:15.937 --> 23:18.731
I prefer horseback riding
over flying my plane.

23:19.941 --> 23:21.442
This fight--

23:22.985 --> 23:25.696
You might end up losing
everything you have.

23:28.491 --> 23:32.120
That's a good thing. Because now…

23:33.913 --> 23:35.706
I have something to fight for.

23:44.382 --> 23:46.926
I understand that you feel wronged.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.971
But that case was closed four years ago.

23:51.556 --> 23:53.432
The election is around the corner.

23:54.142 --> 23:57.186
I can't just sit back
and watch those beasts run wild

23:57.270 --> 23:58.729
in the election again.

24:00.314 --> 24:03.025
You're right.
We can't let them get to us again.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.486
But, Minister Son,

24:06.654 --> 24:10.533
Hwang Gi-seok from Special Investigations
is practically on our side this election.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.870
Thanks to their harsh investigation
of Assemblyman Baek,

24:13.953 --> 24:16.706
the ruling party's ratings took a dive.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.544
All they are doing is hunting down
a powerless old man who once had power.

24:25.381 --> 24:27.800
In the end, they'll hunt us down again.

24:30.261 --> 24:31.429
All right, then.

24:33.890 --> 24:36.058
Is the accomplice certain
about her decision?

24:37.101 --> 24:39.896
If she changes her mind,
we'll have to face a backlash.

24:39.979 --> 24:43.191
I assure you that will never happen.

24:43.941 --> 24:47.069
I'll put everything on the line
and take full responsibility.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.154
All right.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.460
Ms. Kim! Look what you've done!

25:03.336 --> 25:05.755
How could you stab me in the back?

25:08.382 --> 25:11.135
Mr. Myeong, I must've lost my mind.

25:11.219 --> 25:14.013
I'm such a crazy bitch. You crazy bitch!

25:15.348 --> 25:18.935
I'm sorry. Please let it slide this once.
I'll never do it again.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.728
What's the point, after all this time?

25:22.772 --> 25:25.733
Should I sew your lips?

25:27.860 --> 25:29.070
Or…

25:40.164 --> 25:42.875
-should I burn them?
-Please save me!

25:43.751 --> 25:46.295
I beg you, spare me!

25:46.379 --> 25:48.673
People must think
I'm a gang leader or something.

25:50.091 --> 25:53.636
We've been friends for a long time,
so we can solve this with money.

25:53.719 --> 25:54.720
But,

25:55.680 --> 25:59.392
to remind you of your wrongdoings
and as a sign of self-reflection…

26:02.270 --> 26:04.480
let's get you a nice tattoo!

26:07.024 --> 26:10.152
Didn't you say you became friends
with Eun Yong in juvie?

26:10.987 --> 26:12.780
You didn't know he was in Korea?

26:13.656 --> 26:15.741
When I went to prison,

26:15.825 --> 26:18.786
we lost touch, so I haven't heard
from him for a long time.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.121
Is that so?

26:20.204 --> 26:21.205
Yes, sir.

26:30.172 --> 26:32.383
Transfer Ms. Kim's assets under your name.

26:32.466 --> 26:33.843
My name?

26:33.926 --> 26:37.805
Seong-tae isn't here anymore,
so someone has to do his work.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.603
I'll serve you well, sir.

27:25.227 --> 27:28.189
JUDGE ADVOCATE
PARK JOON-GYEONG

27:32.485 --> 27:35.654
-Have you arrived?
-Thanks. I'm here.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.324
I'll call after I finish my deal
with CEO Oh.

27:39.116 --> 27:41.118
Yeah. Bye.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.800
APPLICANT PARK JOON-GYEONG

28:51.522 --> 28:52.690
Did you call for me, sir?

28:52.773 --> 28:55.609
I heard from Chief Park
you're wrapping up the Kim Seong-tae case.

28:56.193 --> 28:59.947
Yes. I finished it up nicely,
just like you ordered, sir.

29:00.573 --> 29:01.574
Really?

29:02.450 --> 29:03.742
It doesn't look that way.

29:04.535 --> 29:05.786
Sorry?

29:05.870 --> 29:07.746
The name is Eun Yong.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.166
He's your uncle, right?

29:20.301 --> 29:21.594
What are you doing?

29:30.352 --> 29:32.354
Financial Supervisory Service is here.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.569
I checked, and he flew
into the country a few days ago.

29:38.652 --> 29:41.822
And as soon as he arrived,
he's been on the move to buy shares.

29:42.323 --> 29:44.408
But coincidentally, he's buying

29:45.826 --> 29:49.330
GMI Bank shares,
the case in which his nephew is in charge.

29:49.413 --> 29:50.581
GMI SHARES REPORT

29:51.916 --> 29:54.210
-I had no idea--
-Did you, as a prosecutor,

29:54.293 --> 29:56.086
use confidential information

29:56.170 --> 29:58.672
to conspire with a concert party
for your own gain?

30:01.467 --> 30:03.844
Put that down! What are you doing?

30:03.928 --> 30:06.889
-I'll sue you for obstruction of business!
-Go ahead!

30:06.972 --> 30:09.892
We'll sue you for obstruction of justice!
Out of our way!

30:23.989 --> 30:27.201
I think I can take on three,
don't you think?

30:28.619 --> 30:30.037
Did Chairman Myeong send you?

30:39.838 --> 30:43.050
We're from Financial Supervisory Service.
Step away from the computer.

30:54.311 --> 30:55.396
Oh, my!

30:57.856 --> 31:00.025
Abuse of power, bribery,

31:00.109 --> 31:02.361
insider trading
using confidential information.

31:02.444 --> 31:06.615
If I take this case, you'll become
a corrupt prosecutor in less than a week.

31:06.699 --> 31:09.910
You'll be standing before the press
in cuffs.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.420
Why did you do this?

31:40.190 --> 31:43.444
I was planning on training you properly
because you seemed useful.

31:44.528 --> 31:45.779
Why?

31:49.325 --> 31:52.995
Why would you rack your dumb brain
and ruin your life?

31:57.916 --> 31:58.917
Hey.

32:00.586 --> 32:01.920
You're done now.

32:14.558 --> 32:15.684
It's been a while.

32:17.186 --> 32:18.312
How have you been?

32:30.199 --> 32:32.868
I knew you'd take care of a few guys.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.580
I'm sorry I couldn't come visit

32:37.998 --> 32:39.750
when your grandmother passed.

32:46.840 --> 32:47.966
Hey, Jin-ho.

32:48.926 --> 32:50.094
Work with me now.

32:51.261 --> 32:53.055
Working for Chairman Myeong--

33:13.200 --> 33:14.451
Prosecutor Jang.

33:15.369 --> 33:17.329
He asked for you to return
your entry card.

33:34.638 --> 33:36.807
UNCLE EUN YONG

33:40.269 --> 33:43.856
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
At the tone, please record your…

33:51.697 --> 33:54.450
We have a problem.
Call me as soon as possible.

34:17.973 --> 34:21.268
-What's going on?
-The inspection team is here for a check.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.994
Did something happen
between you and Mr. Hwang?

34:52.007 --> 34:53.634
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

34:53.717 --> 34:56.595
-Take the bag to the chairman.
-Right away, sir.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.482
You may speak.

35:08.565 --> 35:11.443
-I've sent over the contract first.
-What about him?

35:22.579 --> 35:25.207
It's a shame I didn't get to say
a proper goodbye.

35:28.335 --> 35:30.003
Wrap it up nicely, got it?

35:34.216 --> 35:35.217
Yes, sir.

35:47.688 --> 35:50.440
My kid studied hard on his own

35:50.524 --> 35:53.151
and got into a good company
after taking an exam.

35:53.235 --> 35:55.737
There's nothing I can do about that.

35:55.821 --> 35:58.866
Is an assemblyman's son forbidden
from getting a job?

35:58.949 --> 36:00.659
Gosh, these people…

36:02.244 --> 36:07.291
Weren't you going to train Jang Tae-chun?
That's what I thought because of the news.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.334
He's got the guts.

36:10.627 --> 36:11.837
But he's tactless.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.590
After all, he's from a lousy university.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.427
I'll reassign the case on Kim Seong-tae
to Prosecutor Choi.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.891
Your actions against me right now

36:23.974 --> 36:27.519
are an attack against Korean democracy!

36:27.603 --> 36:32.608
Sir, we don't have any cameras here.
You don't need to exaggerate anymore.

36:36.570 --> 36:39.323
Make sure you write that on the report.

36:39.406 --> 36:40.407
Yes, sir.

36:41.909 --> 36:45.495
Hey, Lee Yeong-jin.
You used to be in Supreme Office, huh?

36:45.579 --> 36:46.580
Yes, sir.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.083
The deputy chief prosecutor there
was Cho Jang-hun, right?

36:50.167 --> 36:51.293
The half-bald guy.

36:51.376 --> 36:54.504
He got a hair transplant,
but, yes, he was deputy chief prosecutor.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.715
Did you know?

36:56.798 --> 36:58.717
He used to work right under me.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.762
He told me a lot about you.
That you are smart.

37:02.971 --> 37:06.516
Hey, but don't you have anything to drink?

37:10.771 --> 37:12.481
What would you like to drink?

37:16.944 --> 37:19.613
Hey, Gi-seok! Are you there?

37:19.696 --> 37:21.782
I'm thirsty.

37:21.865 --> 37:24.701
Bring me a bottle of beer, will you?

37:26.703 --> 37:29.831
Investigator, go grab us some beer.

37:29.915 --> 37:30.916
Yes, sir.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.379
Sir, we're getting beer right now.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.673
Prosecutor Lee,
let's take a 20-minute break.

37:39.424 --> 37:42.469
Okay! Thank you, thank you!

37:44.680 --> 37:47.516
Gosh, Mr. Baek is so obnoxious.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.268
How far are you going to take this?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.858
-You went to the same high school as him?
-Yeah.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.362
-I mean, he's way older than me, but--
-He's a goner now.

38:00.988 --> 38:04.700
It's about his son's unfair recruitment.
He has no hope for the next term.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.369
It seems like his party abandoned him too.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.453
Yeah.

38:09.538 --> 38:14.167
Still, we don't want the opposing party
to spread their wings before the election.

38:14.251 --> 38:17.713
After all, he's a senior prosecutor,
so we should protect his digni--

38:17.796 --> 38:19.548
If you made a deal with him, let me know.

38:19.631 --> 38:23.427
-Don't whine about it after it blows up.
-What did you say?

38:24.469 --> 38:26.346
You're out of line here.

38:29.516 --> 38:30.517
Out of line?

38:32.310 --> 38:33.603
I guess I was.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.153
So what?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.074
Hey, Jeong-su.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.785
Stop meddling in business…

38:50.829 --> 38:53.749
you can't even handle, all right?

38:55.000 --> 38:57.669
Just prepare well for your transfer
to the district office.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.880
Don't you want your promotion?

39:06.136 --> 39:07.179
Yes, sir.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.014
Yes.

39:11.183 --> 39:14.019
I've taken care of Minister Son.

39:15.771 --> 39:19.149
I'll look forward to your investigation
based on law and order

39:19.232 --> 39:20.692
in the future as well.

39:23.195 --> 39:24.237
Of course, sir.

39:24.321 --> 39:27.657
I promise to bring results
you'll be satisfied with.

39:32.662 --> 39:36.249
-The press conference got canceled.
-What? All of a sudden?

39:36.333 --> 39:38.752
Thanks to the investigation,
our party rating is on the rise.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.129
The party thinks holding back
Special Investigations

39:41.213 --> 39:42.631
won't help with the election.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.092
Isn't the prosecution influencing
a past election

39:45.175 --> 39:46.885
much bigger news than that?

39:46.968 --> 39:48.512
That's still only a possibility.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.556
But Assemblyman Baek's investigation
ensures our votes.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.100
Nothing has changed.

39:53.183 --> 39:56.228
I will turn myself in to the prosecution
and testify, as we planned.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.816
The prosecution won't cooperate either.

40:01.733 --> 40:05.362
I think CEO Oh met with our party leader
and persuaded him last night.

40:07.781 --> 40:08.949
CEO Oh?

40:33.515 --> 40:35.350
Are you feeling better now?

40:36.726 --> 40:39.437
I'm dying here.
I've had one too many drinks.

40:41.189 --> 40:44.484
You heard that the opposing party
has been taken care of, right?

40:44.568 --> 40:46.194
Great work, sir.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.824
So, did you get the contract
from Dongdaemun?

40:50.907 --> 40:53.451
Of course. I'm close with everyone there.

41:01.334 --> 41:02.544
Is this the right one?

41:02.627 --> 41:07.174
Gosh, if you needed money,
you should've come to me.

41:08.717 --> 41:11.178
What happened to the guy
who blackmailed me with this?

41:11.261 --> 41:13.013
He didn't seem like a pushover.

41:15.432 --> 41:18.977
Financial Supervisory Service raided
his fund, so there's nothing he could do.

41:19.060 --> 41:23.106
He left the country
before they issued his travel ban.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.499
Prepare the money before the election,
like you promised yesterday.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.793
I always keep my word.

41:45.045 --> 41:47.214
So, Mr. Oh,

41:47.297 --> 41:50.258
stop leaving evidence behind
by moving independently.

41:50.342 --> 41:53.220
Be sure to discuss everything with me
before you do anything.

41:54.387 --> 41:57.682
-Gosh, that hurts!
-Hey, you prick.

41:57.766 --> 42:00.769
Hey, Myeong In-ju.

42:02.729 --> 42:04.773
Do you think I'm at a level

42:05.607 --> 42:06.900
where I have to

42:07.567 --> 42:09.152
discuss everything with you?

42:10.362 --> 42:11.613
Not at all, sir.

42:13.490 --> 42:15.367
It was a slip of the tongue, sir.

42:18.036 --> 42:22.666
Make sure this doesn't happen ever again.
Behave like a real cartel leader.

42:22.749 --> 42:25.043
-Got that?
-Yes, sir.

42:25.126 --> 42:26.836
I'll serve you well, sir.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.464
Since you are four years older now,

42:29.547 --> 42:33.927
make sure you do everything properly
this election, all right?

42:34.511 --> 42:36.054
Yes, sir.

43:00.620 --> 43:01.621
Yong!

43:09.421 --> 43:10.755
Why can't I reach--

43:11.464 --> 43:13.091
You can't reach him either?

43:32.527 --> 43:33.903
Where are we?

43:37.032 --> 43:38.533
On the way to the airport.

43:41.786 --> 43:42.871
What happened?

43:44.748 --> 43:47.459
This is for the hospital bill
you paid for my grandma.

43:48.877 --> 43:52.464
Thank you for taking care of her
while I was behind bars.

43:53.882 --> 43:56.176
Your grandma is family.
No need to thank me.

43:57.427 --> 43:59.554
This is as far as I can help you.

44:00.347 --> 44:02.474
Don't ever come back to Korea.

44:03.683 --> 44:05.894
If you do,
it's the end for the both of us.

44:13.693 --> 44:14.694
Jin-ho.

44:17.113 --> 44:18.365
Just come with me.

44:20.033 --> 44:22.452
Stop this ridiculous work
and work with me.

44:22.535 --> 44:23.787
You never change.

44:23.870 --> 44:27.290
I know you made a fortune.
But your ways don't work here.

44:28.500 --> 44:31.127
Do you know the kind of people
that visit Chairman Myeong's villa?

44:31.211 --> 44:33.088
I'm doing this because I know.

44:39.010 --> 44:40.678
Have you been doing drugs?

44:42.347 --> 44:45.433
Don't you know what happened
to the guys that got hooked on drugs?

44:45.517 --> 44:47.685
You're not the only one who changed.

44:48.812 --> 44:50.063
Our lives…

44:50.939 --> 44:53.274
were over the moment we got sent to juvie.

44:53.358 --> 44:55.026
Still, doing drugs?

44:57.862 --> 44:59.739
It's fine, as long as you control it.

44:59.823 --> 45:01.533
It enhances your concentration too.

45:12.377 --> 45:14.212
My car is nice, right?

45:14.796 --> 45:17.507
Hey, I'm going to make it big now.

45:19.134 --> 45:20.885
Thanks to you, I got my chance.

45:23.555 --> 45:25.306
You wearing your seat belt?

45:25.390 --> 45:27.142
Why? You scared?

45:28.268 --> 45:29.561
The car is nice indeed.

45:33.982 --> 45:34.983
Fuck!

45:54.752 --> 45:56.337
Let go!

46:24.365 --> 46:25.366
Damn.

46:36.085 --> 46:37.086
Fuck.

46:39.964 --> 46:41.674
Is this 911?

46:41.758 --> 46:43.927
There's been a car accident here.

46:44.010 --> 46:46.095
Please track my phone and come quickly.

46:47.180 --> 46:48.640
Yes, thank you.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.313
Gosh.

47:26.469 --> 47:28.012
GENERAL SURGERY CLINIC

47:44.529 --> 47:47.407
I think you can sell Orland Bio
at 14,000 won.

47:47.490 --> 47:50.952
The guy who told me to buy it said
it'll go over 20,000 won a share.

47:51.035 --> 47:53.621
Those who profit from stocks
spread rumors like that.

47:54.330 --> 47:56.040
They'll sell and run.

47:57.041 --> 48:01.546
Looking at the volume, I'd say
they are aiming for… about 14,000 won.

48:01.629 --> 48:04.173
Really? That could've been a disaster.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.556
-What? You two came together?
-What happened to you?

48:11.639 --> 48:14.309
What do you mean, what happened?
I almost died.

48:14.392 --> 48:16.060
You think this is funny?

48:16.811 --> 48:18.062
Are you badly hurt?

48:19.981 --> 48:21.941
Fortunately, the guy had a nice car.

48:22.025 --> 48:23.735
He got lucky.

48:23.818 --> 48:26.738
-But still, make sure to have a checkup.
-Okay.

48:26.821 --> 48:29.240
I'll prescribe you some pills for today.

48:29.324 --> 48:31.576
Thank you. Here. Best of luck.

48:35.955 --> 48:39.167
Why are you guys brooding?
I'm the one who got injured.

48:41.544 --> 48:43.129
I'm fine.

48:45.465 --> 48:49.010
The opposing party pulled out,
and Hwang Gi-seok started cornering us.

48:49.844 --> 48:51.346
It's just like Chairman Myeong.

48:51.971 --> 48:54.349
He found out our moves
and played his cards.

48:54.432 --> 48:56.100
He even attempted to murder you.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.854
-I'll get a warrant issued for murder.
-There's no need.

49:00.605 --> 49:02.231
It's time to pay him back.

49:02.315 --> 49:04.525
How will you get payback
when CEO Oh betrayed you?

49:06.444 --> 49:09.405
I have just the right card
for this dirty dogfight.

49:09.489 --> 49:11.074
Who?

49:11.157 --> 49:12.241
The enemy's enemy.

49:13.826 --> 49:16.412
It means we're on the same team.
Doesn't it?

49:34.514 --> 49:36.140
Hello, sir.

49:38.935 --> 49:42.522
Hey! I told you not to let anyone in here!

49:44.732 --> 49:46.776
I have nothing to say to a reporter.

49:51.030 --> 49:53.991
Seriously?
I said I have nothing to tell you!

49:55.827 --> 49:57.745
I'm not a reporter.

50:06.879 --> 50:09.590
What brings a vice president
of a hedge fund here?

50:10.383 --> 50:13.469
Our company was raided by
Financial Supervisory Service today.

50:14.303 --> 50:17.515
The one behind it seems to be
Hwang Gi-seok from Special Investigations.

50:17.598 --> 50:20.268
Gosh, those dirty bastards.

50:24.605 --> 50:26.357
Why don't you pour me one?

50:29.527 --> 50:33.531
I'm sure you're not here to drink
out of sympathy.

50:37.452 --> 50:39.203
I'm just a powerless assemblyman.

50:39.287 --> 50:42.123
I'm sure you know I'm in no position
to grant you any favors,

50:42.206 --> 50:44.375
as I can't pull strings anymore.

50:46.502 --> 50:50.214
That powerless string of yours--
I'm here to offer you a fortune for it.

50:52.884 --> 50:55.011
On top of that, you'll get your revenge.

50:57.138 --> 50:59.432
I can't trust Assemblyman Baek.

50:59.515 --> 51:00.516
Same here.

51:02.894 --> 51:04.896
You two seem to be hitting it off.

51:05.563 --> 51:08.149
He's a nastier snake than CEO Oh
and does politics for business.

51:08.232 --> 51:10.943
I've dug into him for months
night and day.

51:11.027 --> 51:12.445
He's a piece of garbage.

51:12.528 --> 51:15.114
Why would you trust a person?

51:15.198 --> 51:18.826
Business is about what each party wants.
It's about giving and taking.

51:18.910 --> 51:20.244
By the way, you two…

51:21.537 --> 51:23.915
really said you don't want any ramyeon?

51:24.665 --> 51:27.585
I hate it when people ask for a bite
after saying they won't have any.

51:27.668 --> 51:29.086
Enjoy your ramyeon.

51:29.670 --> 51:30.713
Okay.

51:37.053 --> 51:39.931
-Hey, Han-na.
-Are you sure you're okay?

51:40.014 --> 51:43.226
The investors will throw a fit
when they find out about the car crash.

51:43.309 --> 51:46.145
-You haven't been introduced yet, right?
-This is my partner, Hong--

51:46.229 --> 51:47.522
-I'm Hong Han-na.
-Right.

51:47.605 --> 51:48.856
Except for the number game,

51:48.940 --> 51:51.984
I'm in charge of everything
at the hedge fund called Change.

51:52.068 --> 51:53.986
Especially taking care of him.

51:54.070 --> 51:58.825
I called your doctor, so drop by tomorrow
and get a whole MRI body scan.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.451
I'm Park Joon-gyeong.

52:01.494 --> 52:04.914
Major, you look much prettier in real life
than in your photos.

52:04.997 --> 52:09.126
-Hello. I'm a prosecutor from--
-Oh, you must be Jang Tae-chun.

52:09.752 --> 52:12.380
If Yong is your uncle, am I your aunt?

52:12.463 --> 52:14.173
Nice to meet you.

52:14.257 --> 52:16.467
How did the meeting go
with Assemblyman Baek?

52:19.262 --> 52:20.555
Hey!

52:22.932 --> 52:26.936
Assemblyman Baek?
Gosh, that bastard is a heavy drinker.

52:27.019 --> 52:29.230
Gosh, this is delicious.

52:29.313 --> 52:30.439
Please!

52:30.523 --> 52:32.859
Why are you screaming? Just a bite.

52:32.942 --> 52:35.528
You never stop with just one bite.

52:38.322 --> 52:40.449
-By the way--
-Why? What's wrong?

52:40.533 --> 52:42.451
Will Chairman Myeong take the bait?

52:42.535 --> 52:44.370
Of course, the smell of ramyeon--

52:45.538 --> 52:48.666
The smell of money will lure him in.
He just can't help it.

52:49.458 --> 52:50.877
What kind of bait?

52:52.378 --> 52:54.922
You know the confidential information
you sent me last time?

52:55.006 --> 52:57.300
I found something
that's worth money in there.

53:01.012 --> 53:02.013
Can you move?

53:04.223 --> 53:05.892
Seriously…

53:14.525 --> 53:17.486
Oh, right! Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun!

53:17.570 --> 53:22.450
I knew I'd heard that name somewhere.
I guess he's Manager Eun's nephew.

53:22.533 --> 53:24.702
But that Manager Eun

53:24.785 --> 53:26.537
came to Korea…

53:28.539 --> 53:29.707
and left?

53:29.790 --> 53:30.958
He left.

53:31.918 --> 53:33.794
He left for good this time.

53:37.006 --> 53:39.967
That's why I have a job for you.

53:40.718 --> 53:41.719
What is it?

53:43.596 --> 53:45.681
It's obviously about money.

53:45.765 --> 53:50.853
When you were laundering money,
you left out some of GMI Bank's assets.

53:52.021 --> 53:56.108
That can't be. I laundered and pocketed
everything that was worth money.

53:57.652 --> 54:00.029
You didn't take the patent
that CEO Yoon had

54:01.238 --> 54:03.324
back when she owned Bluenet.

54:04.200 --> 54:08.245
My goodness. That's a patent from
the '70s and '80s that no one uses now.

54:08.329 --> 54:09.872
It's a useless antique.

54:09.956 --> 54:12.291
Gosh, you prick.

54:13.334 --> 54:15.461
Of course it's a piece of junk to us.

54:15.544 --> 54:18.297
But in developing countries like
South America and South East Asia,

54:18.381 --> 54:19.590
it's worth money!

54:23.344 --> 54:26.472
Make sure you register
CEO Yoon's patent for profit.

54:26.555 --> 54:30.351
Then we'll find an overseas IT company
for backdoor listing!

54:30.434 --> 54:34.230
Wow! The charts for this
will look beautiful.

54:34.313 --> 54:36.732
This plan is grand and global.

54:37.566 --> 54:38.943
This feels optimistic!

54:43.239 --> 54:45.199
This is Manager Eun's idea, isn't it?

54:50.913 --> 54:52.957
This is the manipulation plan

54:53.040 --> 54:55.793
the Financial Supervisory Service
seized from his hedge fund.

54:55.876 --> 54:57.920
Geez, that bastard.

54:58.546 --> 55:01.507
He has a knack for finding
where gold is stashed.

55:03.968 --> 55:05.344
But, sir,

55:06.053 --> 55:09.140
ever since we delisted GMI Bank,
it's been on a special watch list,

55:09.849 --> 55:11.809
so we can't get the patent rights.

55:13.102 --> 55:14.437
What did you say?

55:16.731 --> 55:18.774
Well, that's what usually happens.

55:19.942 --> 55:23.863
You can even get confidential data
from the Financial Supervisory Service.

55:23.946 --> 55:25.698
So anything is possible for you.

55:29.618 --> 55:30.745
You punk.

55:33.789 --> 55:36.250
It's been a while.

55:36.333 --> 55:37.501
Please take a look.

55:38.753 --> 55:40.212
What's this?

55:43.007 --> 55:45.801
Oh, Prosecutor Jang. It's been a while.

55:47.720 --> 55:50.181
You don't need to stand up. It's fine.

55:55.311 --> 55:56.520
Enjoy your meal, sir.

55:57.354 --> 55:58.355
Thanks.

55:59.607 --> 56:02.568
You look like you have a lot on your mind.
Is something worrying you?

56:04.070 --> 56:05.696
Gosh, Mr. Hwang. It's been a while.

56:05.780 --> 56:08.282
Oh, Mr. Nam. I hope you are well.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.242
Of course I'm well.

56:10.326 --> 56:12.703
I'll come and visit you
after my retirement.

56:12.787 --> 56:15.664
The door to my office is always open
for you, Mr. Nam.

56:15.748 --> 56:17.249
Please do call me.

56:18.459 --> 56:21.295
-I'll make sure you have a good time.
-Oh, my.

56:21.378 --> 56:23.881
-It's a promise, then.
-All right.

56:23.964 --> 56:25.674
-Enjoy your meal.
-You too.

56:25.758 --> 56:26.926
Enjoy.

56:38.270 --> 56:41.023
Why do you have to make it so obvious
that you hate him?

56:41.607 --> 56:43.734
You deserve to win an Oscar, Mr. Nam.

56:44.360 --> 56:46.278
I almost thought
you two were best friends.

56:48.823 --> 56:51.325
I guess I deserve an Oscar then.
I especially hate him.

56:55.788 --> 56:58.874
But… do you think
my uncle's plan will work?

56:58.958 --> 57:02.086
If he's the only player who beat
Chairman Myeong at his own game,

57:02.169 --> 57:03.712
I'd put my money on him.

57:11.887 --> 57:13.013
Prosecutor Jang.

57:13.597 --> 57:14.682
Yes?

57:14.765 --> 57:16.642
The whale took the bait.

57:28.779 --> 57:30.197
Hey, hey, hey.

57:30.781 --> 57:34.410
Take a look. I've taken care of the dates
to last week and the patent transfer.

57:38.497 --> 57:39.832
Thank you.

57:39.915 --> 57:41.750
I got you a large-sized coffee.

57:48.007 --> 57:49.925
Thank you for the coffee, sir.

58:00.102 --> 58:03.439
Hello, Chairman.
I've transferred the patent rights.

58:04.106 --> 58:06.483
All right. Good work. Come to my office.

58:06.567 --> 58:07.735
Yes, sir.

58:14.116 --> 58:15.993
-A car accident?
-Yes, sir.

58:16.076 --> 58:17.745
Was Jin-ho high again?

58:17.828 --> 58:20.873
I'm not sure of the details, sir.

58:20.956 --> 58:23.459
He's breathing through a ventilator
at the moment.

58:24.418 --> 58:26.545
Gosh, that little brat.

58:28.422 --> 58:30.382
Something feels off here.

58:42.561 --> 58:47.358
-I didn't expect to see you here, Mr. Lee.
-Oh, my. Look who this is. Mr. Nam.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.402
What brings you here, Mr. Nam?

58:53.239 --> 58:55.074
My goodness.

58:55.157 --> 58:57.159
I'm here to arrest you, Mr. Lee.

59:07.503 --> 59:09.046
I have Mr. Lee secured.

59:09.129 --> 59:11.590
Okay. Time to go whale hunting.

59:13.217 --> 59:14.301
Let's go.

59:25.562 --> 59:26.563
Mom,

59:27.815 --> 59:30.776
today is the last day I'm visiting you
in my military uniform.

59:31.944 --> 59:34.280
Although I won't
have dignity as a soldier,

59:34.989 --> 59:38.742
I'll make sure to retrieve
the dignity that you once lost.

59:42.496 --> 59:43.789
I love you, Mom.

1:00:24.913 --> 1:00:26.623
-What's going on?
-First of all,

1:00:26.707 --> 1:00:30.294
please tell us why
you have requested a press conference.

1:00:31.420 --> 1:00:34.340
I would like to confess a crime
that was committed

1:00:34.423 --> 1:00:36.925
three years ago during an investigation.

1:00:37.843 --> 1:00:40.512
As a former prosecutor,
I have to inform you that

1:00:40.596 --> 1:00:42.514
you may have to face charges

1:00:42.598 --> 1:00:46.310
such as defamation and libel
as consequence of this press conference.

1:00:46.393 --> 1:00:49.396
There is no law that can punish me
for revealing the truth.

1:00:50.689 --> 1:00:54.735
Then please, can you introduce yourself?

1:01:15.089 --> 1:01:16.340
I am…

1:01:16.924 --> 1:01:19.718
the daughter of CEO Yoon Hye-rin,
who faced an unfair death

1:01:19.802 --> 1:01:22.179
as a result of insider trading
by those in power.

1:01:22.262 --> 1:01:26.392
And I'm one of the culprits
in the bribery-and-manipulation case

1:01:26.475 --> 1:01:28.310
that led to CEO Yoon's death.

1:01:29.978 --> 1:01:32.439
Please cancel
all his afternoon appointments.

1:01:33.690 --> 1:01:36.652
I ask this question to the accomplice
of the crime I committed,

1:01:37.486 --> 1:01:39.738
Hwang Gi-seok of Special Investigations:

1:01:40.697 --> 1:01:42.032
What is justice…

1:01:43.033 --> 1:01:44.201
to you?
