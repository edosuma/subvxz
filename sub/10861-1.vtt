WEBVTT

00:03.440 --> 00:06.680
We're called 
 the Midnight Society.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.800
[COYOTE HOWLING]

00:11.240 --> 00:15.360
Separately, we're very different. 
 We like different things,

00:15.360 --> 00:20.160
We go to different schools, 
 and we have different friends.

00:20.160 --> 00:23.160
But one thing draws us together--

00:23.160 --> 00:25.880
The dark.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.800
Each week, 
 we gather around this fire

00:28.800 --> 00:33.680
To share our fears 
 and our strange and scary tales.

00:33.680 --> 00:36.280
It's what got us together,

00:36.280 --> 00:39.840
and it's what keeps 
 bringing us back.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.920
This is a warning to all who join us--

00:42.920 --> 00:45.840
you're going to leave 
 the comfort of the light...

00:47.720 --> 00:51.760
And step into the world 
 of the supernatural.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.160
Watch your step.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.720
- Hey, watch it, man! 
 - I'm sorry.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.520
Frank Moore, 
 you're here to be considered

01:01.520 --> 01:03.280
as a new member of 
 the Midnight Society.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.560
Yeah, what's with the blindford?

01:04.560 --> 01:06.680
This meeting place is a secret.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.720
Yeah, and you're not in yet.

01:08.720 --> 01:11.920
- [FRANK] Swell. 
 - Who sponsors, Frank?

01:11.920 --> 01:13.840
I do. 
 He's a good guy.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.880
Yeah, but can he tell a good story?

01:15.880 --> 01:18.400
Who said that?

01:18.400 --> 01:20.280
To be a member, you have 
 to tell us a scary tale.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.400
Then we vote, and it has 
 to be unanimous or you're not in.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.960
- You ready? 
 - Yeah. I'm ready.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.400
- Are you guys ready? 
 - Ohh!  - Ohh!

01:29.400 --> 01:31.600
I'm scared now. Ooh!

01:37.080 --> 01:38.960
Yo, take this thing off.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.640
Sorry. 
 Not unless you get in.

01:41.640 --> 01:45.360
You're the sponsor, Dave. 
 You got to start it.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.440
Remember how to do it?

01:49.440 --> 01:52.480
[FRANK] 
 Just say the word.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.640
Anytime. 
 OK, let's do it.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.680
Submitted for the approval, 
 of the Midnight Society,

01:59.680 --> 02:01.840
I call this story...

02:14.480 --> 02:16.640
[FRANK] 
 Denny and Buzz were brothers.

02:16.640 --> 02:19.760
Denny was big, strong, and smart.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.760
Buzz was, well, kind of a geek

02:22.760 --> 02:26.560
who wanted to prove himself 
 to his big brother.

02:32.040 --> 02:36.800
What neither guy knew was 
 that on this hiking trap,

02:36.800 --> 02:40.000
Buzz was going to get the chance.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.520
So where are we, Tonto?

02:57.520 --> 03:00.160
This is strange.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.680
We're lost, aren't we? 
 "Don't sweat, Denny.

03:03.680 --> 03:06.840
I know how to plot a course. 
 You never trust me."

03:06.840 --> 03:09.840
I did trust you, and you 
 got us lost, Cheeseball.

03:09.840 --> 03:12.280
- We're not lost. 
 - Watch it!

03:12.280 --> 03:13.920
Great, Lame-wad!

03:13.920 --> 03:16.320
Now we're lost, 
 and we can't read the map.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.720
You are such a loser.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.240
I'm not a loser, 
 and we're not lost.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.440
Look. 
 There's the ridge we came up on.

03:23.440 --> 03:26.560
We can circle back 
 and take the red trail.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.000
Man, this is whacked.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.160
Watch the edge.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.400
Whoa!

03:35.080 --> 03:38.520
- Grab my hand. 
 - I can't! I'll fall!

03:38.520 --> 03:41.400
Grab me you jerk!

03:53.360 --> 03:56.160
Hey, I saved the compass.

03:57.800 --> 04:00.680
I should have let you fall.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.600
[FRANK] 
 The guys really were lost.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.280
It was just a pain at first,

04:07.280 --> 04:11.440
but nighttime was coming up fast, 
 and It was getting cold.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.760
It doesn't make sense.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.440
Do you even know 
 how to use this?

04:23.440 --> 04:26.360
Give me a break. 
 We've been going South for hours.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.920
We should have been in town by now.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.840
Look, the needle points North, 
 and we're headed South.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.440
What can I say?

04:33.440 --> 04:35.240
That the way you always hold it?

04:35.240 --> 04:36.840
Yeah. So?

04:36.840 --> 04:39.080
Your belt buckle, genius. 
 It's metal.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.720
The needle's always going to point to it, 
 because it's a magnet.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.800
- Uh-oh. 
 - Yeah. Uh-Oh.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.680
We've been going 
 the wrong way all day.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.560
Now we're lost, 
 and its freezing.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.720
- You are worthless! 
 - No! No! I know this place.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.160
We've got to be close to town!

04:56.480 --> 04:58.760
[DENNY] 
 Slow down!

05:03.480 --> 05:06.480
This trail up here! 
 Come on!

05:16.880 --> 05:19.080
I should pound you!

05:20.480 --> 05:22.240
Look!

05:23.360 --> 05:25.760
Someone's coming.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.520
- [DENNY] Maybe it's a Ranger. 
 - Or maybe it's a hiker

05:29.520 --> 05:31.480
that knows his way back to town.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.400
I hope he's got a blanket. 
 I'm freezing!

05:33.400 --> 05:36.720
- Me, too! 
 - Forget it! You can freeze.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.520
Maybe it's a maniac killer 
 in a hockey mask

05:39.520 --> 05:41.640
who's going to slash us.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.760
Or maybe you should stay here, 
 and let me do the talking.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.720
Uh, hey, hello, who's there?

05:47.720 --> 05:50.080
Whoa! Turn off the brights.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.800
Hello. 
 What have we here?

05:53.800 --> 05:56.040
I'm Buzz, and this is Denny.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.680
We got lost, we can't 
 find the trail back to town.

05:59.680 --> 06:00.760
Easy, Toad.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.480
- You're not a Ranger, are you? 
 - Ha ha ha!

06:03.480 --> 06:05.440
Ranger? No, not me.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.280
I'm a traveler, same as you.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.320
Flynn's the name. 
 Ha ha ha!

06:09.320 --> 06:13.200
So, what are you doing up here? 
 Are you lost, too?

06:13.200 --> 06:16.760
Lost-- me? 
 Oh, you might say that,

06:16.760 --> 06:19.680
though I suppose 
 I couldn't be truly lost.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.680
I know these woods too well.

06:21.680 --> 06:25.040
We far from town? 
 Farther than you know, my friends.

06:25.040 --> 06:28.760
- Farther than you know. 
 - So, can you help us get back?

06:28.760 --> 06:29.960
Me?

06:29.960 --> 06:32.160
Yeah, you. 
 I don't see anybody else here.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.960
You guys look half-frozen. 
 Tell you what.

06:34.960 --> 06:40.360
You follow me, and I'll lead you 
 to someone who can help you.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.160
Wait.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.680
I wouldn't go with him. 
 He gives me the creeps.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.520
You got a better idea?

06:51.520 --> 06:54.480
Don't worry. 
 I can handle this dude.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.600
[BUZZ] Why don't you just 
 tell us how to get back?

07:12.600 --> 07:15.760
Too far. You'd never find 
 your way in the dark.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.720
So who's this guy 
 you're taking us to?

07:17.720 --> 07:20.800
The Good Doctor. He's got a 
 cottage little ways up here.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.040
In the woods?

07:22.040 --> 07:23.440
What kind of a doctor 
 lives in the woods?

07:23.440 --> 07:26.960
Patience, boys. You'll see. 
 By the way--

07:26.960 --> 07:29.280
How are you guys at solving riddles?

07:29.280 --> 07:30.920
Riddles? Why?

07:30.920 --> 07:33.840
Just asking. Just asking.

07:36.840 --> 07:41.320
There you go, boys-- 
 the home of the Good Doctor,

07:41.320 --> 07:43.160
just like I promised.

07:43.160 --> 07:46.680
You guys thought 
 I was joking, didn't you?

07:49.160 --> 07:51.760
[DENNY] Who lives here, 
 the seven dwarves?

07:51.760 --> 07:53.600
There's just one thing, guys.

07:53.600 --> 07:56.280
Before you go asking 
 the doctor for help,

07:56.280 --> 07:58.240
you make sure you really need it.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.440
Why?

07:59.440 --> 08:03.480
Well, sometimes the price 
 he charges is a little, uh... steep.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.880
Ha ha ha ha!

08:04.880 --> 08:08.080
So, why don't you tell us how--

08:10.120 --> 08:13.240
- Yo, Flynn! 
 - This is creepy. Let's bolt.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.880
To where? 
 We're lost, remember?

08:17.200 --> 08:19.080
You're not going in there!

08:19.080 --> 08:22.800
What else are we going to do? 
 It's freezing.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.920
Maybe he's got a phone.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.039
Back off, would you?

08:34.039 --> 08:36.280
I'm sorry I got us lost, Denny.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.039
Don't worry. I'll smack 
 you when we get home.

08:39.039 --> 08:42.360
- [TWIG SNAPS] 
 - [SOBBING]

08:44.080 --> 08:45.320
What's that?

08:45.320 --> 08:48.680
Flynn, I know it's you. 
 He's trying to scare us.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.320
- He's doing a good job. 
 - [TWIG SNAPS]

08:51.320 --> 08:55.000
That can't be him, too. 
 Probably a raccoon.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.360
- That's no raccoon! 
 - [HIGH-PITCHED WAILING]

08:58.360 --> 09:01.240
- Denny, what's going on? 
 - [WICKED LAUGHTER]

09:01.240 --> 09:03.280
Denny-- come on!

09:03.280 --> 09:05.640
- What's there? 
 - I don't know.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.160
Open up!

09:10.640 --> 09:15.080
[MAN] You boys have made 
 a very grave mistake.

09:17.720 --> 09:22.640
I don't suppose either of you 
 are any good at riddles?

09:22.640 --> 09:26.440
Ha ha ha ha!

09:29.960 --> 09:33.800
The wrong house. 
 Bye.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.920
Boys, boys. 
 You've made a mistake.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.920
If you're at my door at 
 this time of night,

09:38.920 --> 09:42.000
you've taken a wrong turn 
 and lost your way. Correct?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.560
- Yeah. 
 - Happens all the time.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.640
Come in, come in. 
 Get warm.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.520
Vink's the name-- Dr. Vink.

10:17.520 --> 10:21.360
- Dr. Fink? 
 - Vink-- with a vvv, vvv, vvv, vvv.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.920
Who wants tea? I do!

10:24.920 --> 10:27.880
Hot Tea at a cold night-- perfect.

10:27.880 --> 10:32.840
[DENNY] uh... Flynn said you could 
 help us find a way to get back to town.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.920
- Natural Science. 
 - Huh?

10:34.920 --> 10:37.680
That's why I'm here, 
 in case you're wondering.

10:37.680 --> 10:40.760
I dedicated my life 
 to studying Flora and Fauna.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.120
Who?

10:42.120 --> 10:46.360
There are many strange and 
 wonderful things that ocur in nature,

10:46.360 --> 10:50.480
but no one takes the time 
 to really look and study.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.600
Observe.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.240
[WHISPERING] 
 This guy's a nut-bag.

10:55.960 --> 11:00.080
Behold a true wonder of nature--

11:00.320 --> 11:03.840
the brian of a Wild Boar.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.400
Eewww... cool!

11:06.400 --> 11:09.440
I've discovered that long 
 after the body dies,

11:09.440 --> 11:12.400
the brain still gives 
 off electric impluses.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.600
Can you imagine If that 
 energy could be harnessed?

11:18.280 --> 11:22.400
And, I am not a nut-bag.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.120
Look, our parents are probably 
 going nuts by now, and, uh--

11:27.120 --> 11:28.600
Riddles.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.080
How are you boys at riddles?

11:31.080 --> 11:34.440
Doc, we're tired, 
 and we just want to go home.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.240
Indeed, indeed. 
 But first, a riddle.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.440
Try this one--

11:39.440 --> 11:43.080
how far can you walk 
 into the woods?

11:43.080 --> 11:44.840
We don't want to do riddles.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.360
But you must! 
 Riddles exercise your brain,

11:47.360 --> 11:49.520
and where would you 
 be with no brain?

11:49.520 --> 11:51.840
I don't know. 
 Ask the Wild Boar.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.800
- Halfway. 
 - Say what?

11:54.800 --> 11:57.560
He asked how far 
 you can walk into the woods.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.520
Halfway. 
 After that, you'd be walking out.

12:00.520 --> 12:03.080
Good! Very good!

12:03.080 --> 12:05.000
You may do.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.880
[DENNY] 
 Uh, I'm going to call our folks.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.000
No, no, not yet!

12:11.000 --> 12:14.840
We've only just begun. 
 No. I think we're done.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.360
We play by my rules, 
 or we don't play.

12:20.360 --> 12:24.480
- What do you want? 
 - Another riddle.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.600
Here's the deal--

12:26.600 --> 12:30.000
I ask you a riddle, 
 and if you solve it,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.800
you could call your parents.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.400
And If we don't solve it?

12:37.720 --> 12:41.520
- Then you leave. 
 - That's it? We just leave?

12:41.520 --> 12:43.440
Simple, no?

12:43.440 --> 12:46.760
Let's do it. 
 I'm good at riddles.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.600
- OK, what's the riddle? 
 - Wonderful.

12:54.600 --> 12:59.160
Wonderful! 
 Now, what riddle?

13:00.560 --> 13:03.200
Let's see. There's the...

13:03.800 --> 13:06.200
No, not that one.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.360
Maybe the...

13:10.360 --> 13:11.110
No.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.440
Ah-- the perfect choice.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.600
This is a riddle that 
 has perplexed many

13:21.600 --> 13:23.360
and confounded even more,

13:23.360 --> 13:27.160
and now, young lads, 
 it's your turn to solve it.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.960
Here we go.

13:31.120 --> 13:36.040
What is it that had no weight,

13:36.040 --> 13:38.920
can be seen by the naked eye,

13:38.920 --> 13:42.480
and If you put in a barrel,

13:42.480 --> 13:45.880
It would make the barrel lighter?

13:48.760 --> 13:52.480
- I hate riddles! 
 - OK. It's weightless,

13:52.480 --> 13:55.480
tt can be seen by the naked eye,

13:55.480 --> 14:00.040
and if put in a barrel, 
 would make the barrel lighter.

14:00.040 --> 14:00.790
So?

14:04.520 --> 14:06.880
I don't know.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.760
Good-bye. 
 I knew you wouldn't get it.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.960
Wait. 
 That riddle was too hard.

14:14.960 --> 14:18.920
- Give us another one. 
 - You had your chance and failed,

14:18.920 --> 14:21.000
like all the others.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.320
Others? What others?

14:23.320 --> 14:25.120
Go away.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.000
- You know where the door is. 
 - But we're lost!

14:29.000 --> 14:34.520
Take a left on the trail, 
 and follow it to dirt road, and wait.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.880
A taxicab will pick you up.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.000
A cab? In the woods?

14:39.000 --> 14:42.920
Comes by every night. 
 Hurry, or you'll miss it.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.680
Come on, Doc, 
 Just let us use the phone.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.960
There is one way, 
 I suppose.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.880
What? What's that?

14:56.880 --> 15:02.880
- You can leave me a specimen. 
 - A specimen?

15:05.920 --> 15:10.880
You're much smarter than your 
 brother gives you credit for.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.120
What kind of specimen?

15:13.120 --> 15:17.840
Something 
 I can use in my experiments.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.440
Something valuable.

15:22.440 --> 15:25.080
Something fresh.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.440
Something like...

15:27.440 --> 15:28.540
- this! 
 - Aah! - Aah!

15:35.160 --> 15:39.360
- Aah! 
 - Aah!

15:42.480 --> 15:46.440
Goodbye... for now.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.280
Ha ha ha ha ha!

15:52.880 --> 15:56.040
Wait a minute. 
 Wait a minute. No fair.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.840
You can't put a riddle in a story 
 that can't be solved.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.200
- Maybe it can. 
 - Yeah, right.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.200
It's weightless, you can see it,

16:04.200 --> 16:08.000
and if you put it in a barrel, 
 it makes the barrel lighter.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.520
No way.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.560
Sounds like one of those riddles 
 you can't solve.

16:12.560 --> 16:17.080
- That's a cheat. 
 - No. Maybe it can be solved.

16:17.080 --> 16:21.440
Maybe you should all just lighten up 
 and let me finish the story.

16:21.440 --> 16:24.560
[COYOTE HOWLS]

16:24.560 --> 16:26.600
Thank you.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.920
So Denny and Buzz beat feet 
 back into the woods.

16:30.920 --> 16:36.120
All they wanted was to get as 
 far away from Dr. Vink as possible.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.880
Hey, Denny, wait up!

16:38.880 --> 16:41.480
Was... 
 was that somebody's hand?

16:41.480 --> 16:44.000
You saw it. 
 That guy's a lunatic!

16:44.000 --> 16:47.360
Soon as we get home, 
 I'm calling the cops.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.040
- We're still lost, you know. 
 - Yeah, I know.

16:52.040 --> 16:55.080
You really think a cab's 
 going come by?

16:55.080 --> 16:57.600
Get real. 
 There's no cabs in the woods.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.560
[HONK HONK]

17:00.400 --> 17:03.000
[HONK HONK]

17:03.000 --> 17:05.400
No. No way.

17:05.400 --> 17:09.839
He wasn't lying. 
 It's a taxicab.

17:16.119 --> 17:20.560
Man, are we ever glad you came by! 
 Take us into town.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.760
- [BELL RINGS] 
 - [TIRES SQUEAL]

17:29.360 --> 17:33.240
Our parents will pay the fare 
 when we get home.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.400
Don't worry. 
 I know you're good for it.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.360
- Flynn! Flynn! 
 - I figured I'd run into you guys again.

17:39.360 --> 17:40.840
Guess you didn't solve the riddle.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.160
How do you know? 
 Who are you?

17:43.160 --> 17:46.840
I give a ride to folks 
 who can't answer Dr. Vink's riddles.

17:46.840 --> 17:50.000
Happened to me 
 around 40 years ago.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.920
- Whoa! Slow down! 
 - 40 years ago?

17:53.920 --> 17:57.400
Yes. I gave Dr. Vink 
 a ride up here in my cab.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.040
He offered me a big tip 
 if I could solve the riddle.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.160
I couldn't, 
 So he took a specimen from me.

18:04.160 --> 18:07.080
- What kind of specimen? 
 - You didn't see it at his house?

18:07.080 --> 18:09.560
Whoo, boy! 
 I think it's one of his favorites.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.000
What is it?

18:11.000 --> 18:14.640
It's not what it is-- 
 it's what it was.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.480
[BUZZ] 
 Uughh!

18:16.480 --> 18:19.480
- He took your hand? 
 - I got off easy.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.400
For 40 years, I've been bringing 
 folks up to Dr. Vink's,

18:22.400 --> 18:25.600
hoping they can solve the riddle, 
 but they don't,

18:25.600 --> 18:27.680
so they all end up here with me.

18:27.680 --> 18:31.000
- What happens to them? 
 - Hey, Dr. Vink needs his specimens.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.800
You're a lying sack! 
 First of all, you're not that old.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.120
Didn't I tell you?

18:35.120 --> 18:37.520
Before the good doctor 
 got his specimen,

18:37.520 --> 18:41.640
I had myself a nasty little accident, 
 crashed into this big old tree.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.960
You might say... I sort of died!

18:44.960 --> 18:50.880
- Ha ha ha! 
 - Aah!  - Aah!

18:51.680 --> 18:53.440
Stop the car. 
 Stop the car!

18:53.440 --> 18:55.520
They all die, just like me.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.120
Every night I have the same 
 accident with a different fare.

18:59.120 --> 19:03.200
Its kinda of a curse. 
 You probably heard some of my fares

19:03.200 --> 19:07.320
- up around Dr. Vink's house. 
 - The bushes-- they were ghosts!

19:07.320 --> 19:10.480
Nobody can leave until someone 
 solves Dr. Vink's riddle.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.800
I was hoping the two of you 
 could do it--

19:13.800 --> 19:16.280
You know, somehow 
 break the spell. Oh, well.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.720
Wait till you see the accident 
 we're going to have.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.680
- It's going to be a real doozie. 
 - This is your fault!

19:21.680 --> 19:24.160
You said you could solve the riddle! 
 You still got time.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.920
We don't crash for another, 
 oh... 30 seconds.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.360
Think fast, boys.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.000
- Think! 
 - OK, OK. It's weightless,

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
it can be seen by the naked eye, 
 and if it's put in a barrel,

19:36.000 --> 19:38.360
it will make the barrel lighter.

19:39.880 --> 19:44.640
- [RATTLING DOOR HANDLE] 
 - We're dead. We're dead!

19:45.680 --> 19:51.720
- I can't think like this! 
 - You have to!

19:51.720 --> 19:55.280
It's helium! 
 Helium will make the barrel lighter.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.240
- But you can't see helium. 
 - Won't be long now.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.520
What can you see that's weightless?

20:00.520 --> 20:04.360
Nothing. 
 Air, but you cant see air.

20:04.360 --> 20:08.000
Or can you? Wait a second. 
 There's a trick here.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.280
You can't put something 
 in the barrel to make it lighter.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.240
You have to take something out.

20:13.240 --> 20:16.800
If you take something out 
 of the barrel itself,

20:16.800 --> 20:18.280
it'll be lighter.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.360
Wait till you see the explosion 
 we're going to make.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.400
- I got it! I know the answer! 
 - What is it?

20:23.400 --> 20:25.480
It's weightless, you could see it,

20:25.480 --> 20:27.840
and if you put it a barrel, 
 it'll make the barrel lighter.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.080
- Say it! 
 - It's a hole in the barrel!

20:31.080 --> 20:35.480
Here we go-- yee-ha!

20:44.400 --> 20:48.000
We didn't crash. 
 We're alive.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.880
Where's the cab? 
 It's gone.

20:51.160 --> 20:54.600
We broke the curse. 
 We're saved!

20:58.520 --> 21:02.520
No, we didn't break the curse. 
 You did.

21:02.520 --> 21:06.600
Nice going. 
 But you're still a loser!

21:13.200 --> 21:16.040
Oh, man, not again!

21:19.480 --> 21:23.240
- You Denny and Buzz Crockers? 
 - Yeah.  - Yeah.

21:23.240 --> 21:27.160
Your parents have been 
 going nuts looking for you.

21:27.160 --> 21:31.640
The whole town's in an uproar. 
 Come on. Get in.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.760
What are you boys doing here, 
 anyway?

21:39.760 --> 21:42.760
- Tell me something. 
 - How are you at riddles?

21:42.760 --> 21:46.600
[FRANK] No one ever saw 
 the Phantom Cab again,

21:46.600 --> 21:51.560
and when the boys brought the police 
 back to Dr Vink's cottage,

21:51.560 --> 21:58.560
all that was left was an old stone 
 foundation covered with weeds.

21:58.560 --> 21:59.520
The End.

22:06.280 --> 22:09.560
And now, we vote. 
 Thumps up means Frank's in,

22:09.560 --> 22:13.520
thumbs down, he's not, 
 and it has to be unanimous.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.280
David?

22:17.680 --> 22:18.930
Kiki?

22:20.720 --> 22:23.520
Betty Ann?

22:24.760 --> 22:27.280
Kristen?

22:27.280 --> 22:28.530
Eric?

22:31.040 --> 22:33.120
And me.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.120
Congratulations, Frank. 
 Welcome to the Midnight Society.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.520
All right! Good job.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.920
Yeah. 
 This is going to be good.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.000
All right.
