11:08.755 --> 11:12.280
At first,
until I got this message.

11:13.629 --> 11:18.547
He left this message yesterday,
I tried calling him back, but--

11:18.590 --> 11:20.418
- Mr. Wells, Brad Hughes here,

11:20.462 --> 11:22.377
following up
on the PELLZ merger,

11:22.420 --> 11:25.075
I think I know who's
behind the illegal trades.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.555
I'd like to meet
with you in person

11:26.598 --> 11:28.688
to discuss
the matter further.

11:28.731 --> 11:31.473
- Before they could meet up,
Brad wound up dead.

11:31.516 --> 11:32.909
- Someone killed him
to keep him quiet.

11:32.953 --> 11:33.954
- Mm-hmm.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.484
- So the victim, Brad Hughes,
reaches out to the SEC

11:42.527 --> 11:44.791
regarding illegal trading
in a company called PELLZ.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.662
He gets killed
before he can blow the whistle.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.750
- It sure looks that way, yeah.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.186
- So we have any idea

11:49.230 --> 11:50.884
who's involved
in the illegal trading?

11:50.927 --> 11:53.669
- Well, Maggie and OA are
interviewing Brad's co-workers.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.890
Scola is combing the SEC files,
recent trading activity.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.414
- All right, keep me apprised.
- Yeah, will do.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.285
- Boss,
can I show you something?

12:01.329 --> 12:03.070
- Why, Ian Lim, you know
you always have my ear.

12:03.113 --> 12:04.071
What is it?

12:04.114 --> 12:05.637
- Brad Hughes' laptop,

12:05.681 --> 12:07.335
I was checking his emails
and search history.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.816
Then I noticed he scanned
for viruses a few days ago,

12:09.859 --> 12:12.732
and turns out, he found one.
- Okay, what kind of virus?

12:12.775 --> 12:14.429
- That's where
it gets interesting.

12:14.472 --> 12:17.040
Peeked into the virus's code.
It is set up to scan

12:17.084 --> 12:20.652
for documents, emails,
and seek out specific key words

12:20.696 --> 12:25.614
like merger, buyout, takeover,
bear hug, tender offer--

12:25.657 --> 12:28.051
- So the virus was trolling
for insider information.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.792
- Yeah, then it scooped up
that info

12:29.836 --> 12:31.751
and it emailed it out.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.535
- Can you figure out
who received that email?

12:33.578 --> 12:35.537
- If I can't, no one can.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.408
- I like your confidence.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.801
- Hey, you guys look like you
got something for me.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.237
What is it?

12:40.281 --> 12:41.586
- So we tracked
the trading history

12:41.630 --> 12:43.110
of PELLZ common stock.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.155
One trade stood out,
a $20 million purchase

12:45.199 --> 12:46.809
just before the merger
was announced,

12:46.853 --> 12:48.202
then sold the next day.

12:48.245 --> 12:49.203
- Who made the trade?

12:49.246 --> 12:50.770
- It's unclear.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.293
It was handled through
a small brokerage house.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.294
- Run it down.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.338
- Okay.

12:57.733 --> 12:58.865
This make you homesick?

12:58.908 --> 13:00.823
- No.
- Hm, not even a little?

13:00.867 --> 13:03.826
- Moved on.
- Okay, so why'd you quit?

13:03.870 --> 13:05.654
- The allure
of government service

13:05.697 --> 13:07.743
and undersized paychecks.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.223
Trey Neely?

13:11.747 --> 13:14.663
- Whoa, is that real?

13:14.706 --> 13:18.623
- It is.
And, uh, we'd like to talk.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.540
- No, man,
it doesn't ring a bell.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.325
I mean, it was, like,
10,000 trades ago.

13:24.368 --> 13:25.761
Are we done?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.589
I'm losing money standing here,
bro.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.026
- All right, look, bro,
you're a junior trader

13:30.070 --> 13:31.854
at a rinky-dink
bucket shop.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.595
$20 million is
the biggest trade

13:33.638 --> 13:34.857
you've ever seen.

13:34.901 --> 13:35.989
Which you turned around
and sold

13:36.032 --> 13:37.904
at near double
the price.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.384
And your 3% commission, well,
that's the biggest commission

13:40.428 --> 13:43.518
you've ever pocketed,
so let's try this again.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.346
Who told you to make
that trade?

13:45.389 --> 13:48.610
Who's the person behind LIG?
Lovecraft Investment Group.

13:48.653 --> 13:49.829
- I'm done here, guys.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.484
- You really wanna do this?

13:53.528 --> 13:56.183
You wanna play hardball
with the FBI?

13:56.226 --> 13:58.838
Why don't you ask around,
see how well that works

13:58.881 --> 14:00.361
for other guys on Wall Street.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.015
- Okay, okay.
Slow down.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.844
- Who told you
to make the PELLZ trade, man?

14:04.887 --> 14:06.584
- I don't know, I swear.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.369
It was all done through
bank wires and phone calls.

14:08.412 --> 14:09.587
- Well, who'd you talk to?

14:09.631 --> 14:11.067
- A voice on the phone.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.677
- Man or woman?

14:12.721 --> 14:14.070
- A woman, she told me
to transfer the money

14:14.114 --> 14:16.246
to a bank in Houston,
so I did.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.292
- I want every file,
every call log,

14:18.335 --> 14:20.816
every detail on those trades.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.339
- Now.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.305
It's greed.

14:32.088 --> 14:33.568
You hated being around people

14:33.611 --> 14:36.397
talking about money
and trades, commissions.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.660
- No, I didn't mind that
at all.

14:40.314 --> 14:42.055
I like money.

14:44.013 --> 14:45.319
- Mm-kay.

14:46.842 --> 14:49.540
- Okay, so Certitrade executed
a 20-million-dollar trade

14:49.584 --> 14:52.848
in PELLZ stock on behalf
of a shell corp called LIG.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.328
A day later,

14:54.371 --> 14:56.765
through the miracle
of modern capitalism

14:56.808 --> 14:59.507
Certitrade sold their position
for 34 million,

14:59.550 --> 15:01.726
transferring the funds
to a Houston bank.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.511
So let's dig in

15:03.554 --> 15:06.079
and find the person behind
that shell corp, shall we?

15:06.122 --> 15:08.124
- Unfortunately the person
behind the shell corp

15:08.168 --> 15:09.386
is another shell corp.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.345
- Mm, what about
the 34 million?

15:11.388 --> 15:12.912
Let's follow that.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.957
- I'm trying to,
but it only stayed in Houston

15:15.001 --> 15:16.611
for less than one second,

15:16.654 --> 15:18.439
then ping-ponged through
a bunch of off-shore banks.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.571
- And let me guess,
ended up in the Cayman Islands.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.182
- Close.
Nevis.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.531
- Nevis?

15:23.574 --> 15:24.662
- According to my friend
in White Collar,

15:24.706 --> 15:26.012
it's the new black.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.970
Latest hotspot
for private banking.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.667
- So a warrant will do
nothing for us,

15:29.711 --> 15:31.713
which means
we're dealing with pros.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.671
Ian, where are we on the virus?

15:33.715 --> 15:35.499
Where did all
that information go?

15:35.543 --> 15:37.762
- I couldn't trace
the recipient.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.764
The docs were sent via Tor

15:39.808 --> 15:42.115
and they disappeared
into the void.

15:42.158 --> 15:43.768
- Void is a dirty word.

15:43.812 --> 15:44.987
Tell me there's more
to that story.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.510
- There is.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.686
Virus was installed
two weeks ago today

15:48.730 --> 15:51.254
at exactly 10:21 p.m.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.603
- Good.

15:52.647 --> 15:55.215
- So if we find out
where Brad was--

15:55.258 --> 15:57.130
- We may find the virus donor.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.174
[whispers]
You're back.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.523
- Yeah, Brad made

15:59.567 --> 16:00.568
a credit card charge
that night.

16:00.611 --> 16:03.614
11:10 p.m. for $342

16:03.658 --> 16:06.748
at a trendy restaurant
called Treasure.

16:06.791 --> 16:10.317
- Yes, Mr. Hughes reserved
a table for 10:15.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.840
Table 23.
That one.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.059
- Was he with anyone else?

16:13.102 --> 16:14.930
- I'm sorry, I didn't work
that night.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.019
- Do you have security footage
going back two weeks,

16:17.063 --> 16:18.151
by any chance?

16:18.194 --> 16:19.413
- I can't share that with you.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.241
Our clients value
their privacy.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.286
- Brad Hughes doesn't.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.896
He's dead.

16:25.767 --> 16:27.725
- If we see the video,
we might be able to figure out

16:27.769 --> 16:28.944
who killed him.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.730
- Okay.
Let me talk to my manager.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.348
- Maybe he logged
onto a website,

16:41.391 --> 16:43.045
downloaded
a virus accidentally?

16:43.089 --> 16:45.482
- Do you have Wi-Fi here?
- Yes.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.571
- Someone coulda hacked him
through the network.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.661
No, wait, he's got a visitor.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.924
- It's his girlfriend,
Elena.

16:52.968 --> 16:54.448
- Mm-hmm.

16:54.491 --> 16:56.015
- See if you can punch in.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.124
- Wait.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.082
So she's the infector?

17:20.126 --> 17:22.954
- And I'm guessing
our inside trader, too.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.351
- So much for the grieving
girlfriend routine.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.754
- Elena Bondar, arrived here
a year ago from Albania

17:39.797 --> 17:41.408
on an H-1B3 visa.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.671
Her sponsor was
World Capital Talent.

17:43.714 --> 17:46.108
It's a modeling agency in SoHo.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.850
Now, you might remember
that Brad Hughes,

17:48.893 --> 17:51.548
our victim, was romantically
involved with Elena.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.985
Color me jaded,
but I'm getting the feeling

17:54.029 --> 17:56.640
she was more in love
with the non-public information

17:56.684 --> 17:59.382
on his laptop
than his wit and good looks.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.602
Now Brad is dead.
Elena's our person of interest.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.256
Whoever helps
track her down gets

18:03.299 --> 18:05.040
the most valuable agent award.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.215
- We just checked
her apartment.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.608
- Yeah?
- She's not there.

18:07.651 --> 18:08.783
But a neighbor saw her
with a suitcase,

18:08.826 --> 18:10.393
waiting for a car.

18:10.437 --> 18:11.829
- Yeah, well--Ian,
what do you got, her phone?

18:11.873 --> 18:13.048
- No, that's been shut off
for hours,

18:13.092 --> 18:14.745
but last night
around 9:00,

18:14.789 --> 18:17.139
she took an Uber to
125 Cherry Street in Tribeca.

18:17.183 --> 18:18.532
- Who lives there?

18:18.575 --> 18:21.970
- Guy named Matt Armand,
investment banker.

18:25.147 --> 18:27.628
- Look, Matt,
we know Elena visited you

18:27.671 --> 18:29.238
at your place in Tribeca
last night,

18:29.282 --> 18:31.936
so why don't you just go ahead
and tell us

18:31.980 --> 18:33.721
what you two talked about?

18:33.764 --> 18:35.636
- What's your interest
in Elena?

18:35.679 --> 18:38.117
- You know, this process
tends to go a lot better

18:38.160 --> 18:40.423
when we're the ones
asking the questions.

18:40.467 --> 18:44.384
- Well, I tend to work better
when I have the answers.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.299
Good data, good results.

18:46.342 --> 18:49.302
- Let me guess, some blowhard
with a fancy MBA

18:49.345 --> 18:50.912
and a black Amex card
told you that

18:50.955 --> 18:52.479
your first week on the job?

18:54.133 --> 18:58.180
I worked here, too.
First job out of college.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.660
But you see,
we're not building

18:59.703 --> 19:01.270
a discounted cash flow model
here, Matt.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.403
We're investigating a murder.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.755
- I don't know anything
about that.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.193
But I know my rights.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.977
I can decline to answer
your questions.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.589
- You certainly can,
and we can certainly

19:15.632 --> 19:17.547
investigate any and all people
connected to

19:17.591 --> 19:19.462
an ongoing criminal
investigation.

19:19.506 --> 19:22.117
- Which means we'd be forced
to subpoena your phone records,

19:22.161 --> 19:25.512
emails, texts, late-night
home alone internet searches,

19:25.555 --> 19:27.905
and, of course, your finances.

19:27.949 --> 19:31.387
- Okay, okay.

19:31.431 --> 19:32.736
Take it easy.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.087
Elena and I used to date.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.133
- Great, where is she?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.048
- In the Hamptons.

19:40.091 --> 19:43.182
She came by last night,
on edge.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.096
Thought somebody
might be following her,

19:45.140 --> 19:47.838
so I gave her the keys
to my place out east.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.318
That's all I know.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.319
I swear.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.929
- What's the address?

19:51.973 --> 19:54.802
- 22 Swan Lane, Wainscott.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.151
- Thank you, Matt.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.241
Oh, and if I were you
I'd look into

19:59.285 --> 20:00.677
my most recent public deals.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.723
There might be
some suspicious trading.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.115
- What are you talking about?

20:04.159 --> 20:06.248
- Elena was dating
another banker.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.642
Stole inside information
from him.

20:10.470 --> 20:14.038
- Yeah, well, that has nothing
to do with me.

20:15.736 --> 20:19.696
- Right, 'cause you're special.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.786
- Please leave.

20:24.745 --> 20:27.182
- Okay, now I know.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.401
It's the arrogance.

20:28.444 --> 20:32.056
All those smug,
elitist bankers.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.710
- Nope.

20:35.756 --> 20:39.281

Too amazing?

stop overthinking it.
