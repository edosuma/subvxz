00:00.789 --> 00:02.523
Previously on This Is Us...

00:02.672 --> 00:05.967
Kev's in rehab.
I let Kevin get sent to rehab.

00:05.992 --> 00:08.259
You need structure,
you need a healthy routine.

00:08.773 --> 00:11.029
You're right. It's exactly why

00:11.054 --> 00:13.632
I know where I need to be.

00:14.601 --> 00:16.914
I want to buy this building
with you, Beth.

00:18.082 --> 00:21.148
I'm thinking I want to try
and start the business again.

00:21.786 --> 00:23.031
Big Three Homes.

00:29.258 --> 00:30.590
Oh, boy.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.593
Wow, what a mess.

00:36.848 --> 00:38.093
Huh.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.434
Hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:40.502 --> 00:41.664
Why throw it out?

00:41.984 --> 00:43.316
Why not yard sale?

00:43.385 --> 00:45.796
No, nobody wants this junk, George.

00:45.984 --> 00:49.689
Junk? Sally, this "junk"
is the stuff of our lives.

00:49.758 --> 00:53.155
If this string of old Christmas
lights is the stuff of my life,

00:53.180 --> 00:54.796
somebody hang me with it.

00:55.148 --> 00:57.623
House has been on the market
for three months, George.

00:57.648 --> 00:59.289
We haven't even had a nibble.

00:59.585 --> 01:02.887
I mean, nobody wants
to live in a house full of...

01:03.398 --> 01:05.465
- ..junk.
- Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05.534 --> 01:06.875
Not my jukebox.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.335
I seem to remember a pretty young woman

01:09.404 --> 01:13.206
coming into my diner,
prettiest smile I'd ever seen,

01:13.914 --> 01:16.046
always pouring her coins into this baby.

01:16.304 --> 01:17.796
- Yeah.
- And played that same song.

01:17.851 --> 01:19.718
- "That'll Be the Day."
- Mm.

01:19.981 --> 01:23.917
♪ That'll be the day,
when you say good-bye... ♪

01:23.985 --> 01:25.630
- What are you doing, George?
- ♪ That'll be the day ♪

01:25.654 --> 01:28.021
♪ When you made me cry ♪

01:28.089 --> 01:29.789

01:29.858 --> 01:31.391

01:31.459 --> 01:34.861

01:34.930 --> 01:36.362
Oh!

01:36.431 --> 01:37.997
You... Mwah.

01:38.066 --> 01:39.165
Throw it out.

01:40.812 --> 01:42.302
"Throw it out."

01:48.914 --> 01:50.948
♪ Super Bowl Sunday. ♪

01:51.016 --> 01:52.164
Oh, is it?

01:52.189 --> 01:53.398
Yeah, no, I don't...

01:53.423 --> 01:54.547
I don't really follow football.

01:54.571 --> 01:56.471
Oh, you don't? Hmm.

01:56.648 --> 01:59.460
Well, chili is going,
and I brought our wake-up shots,

01:59.491 --> 02:02.292
but it's orange juice
this year, not whiskey.

02:02.361 --> 02:04.694
Very rock and roll of us.

02:04.763 --> 02:06.742
Nah, put down the sports page.

02:06.767 --> 02:08.767
It's all Broncos, Broncos, Broncos.

02:08.836 --> 02:11.289
Nah, I'm not there yet. I'm-I'm,
I'm still in real estate.

02:11.773 --> 02:14.601
- Why?
- Oh. Sorry.

02:14.617 --> 02:18.427
So I woke up in the middle
of the night thinking

02:18.452 --> 02:20.608
I can't just quit my job, you know,

02:20.633 --> 02:22.640
and start a construction
company from scratch.

02:23.105 --> 02:25.023
Maybe I'd start slow.

02:25.570 --> 02:27.103
You know, hang onto the job,

02:27.172 --> 02:29.835
flip a few houses, get my feet wet?

02:30.255 --> 02:31.535
I don't know, what do you think?

02:31.789 --> 02:33.443
Yeah, I like that idea.

02:33.512 --> 02:34.882
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

02:34.907 --> 02:36.491
Mom, Randall's been
in the bathroom primping

02:36.515 --> 02:37.614
for, like, an hour.

02:37.682 --> 02:39.182
Well, Allison's coming over,

02:39.251 --> 02:40.971
so maybe he just wants
to look good for her.

02:41.023 --> 02:42.886
Randall looks the same every single day.

02:42.911 --> 02:44.111
He's like a cartoon character.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.204
What is he doing in there?

02:45.257 --> 02:46.456
Randall!

02:46.525 --> 02:49.117
Let your sister use the bathroom now!

02:50.420 --> 02:51.882
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

02:55.007 --> 02:56.734
Last Super Bowl with the kids.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.210
Yeah, I know.

02:58.235 --> 03:00.078
At least we have today.
Let's make it count.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.015
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

03:31.136 --> 03:32.437
Hey-o.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.938
Kevin's blowing up your phone.

03:36.108 --> 03:37.328
What's up?

03:38.704 --> 03:40.870
"No. Sorry.

03:40.978 --> 03:44.773
Can't do a K-venture today.

03:45.406 --> 03:48.085
Headed to new apartment building

03:49.210 --> 03:50.687
to work."

03:51.335 --> 03:53.056
Today's too important for distraction.

03:53.125 --> 03:56.554
Today is the first day of
the rest of our tenants' lives.

03:56.867 --> 03:58.366
It's our first day to turn

03:58.435 --> 03:59.858
this building around
without going broke.

03:59.882 --> 04:01.210
Also, do some good.

04:01.398 --> 04:03.788
Hey. "Do some good, don't go broke."

04:03.813 --> 04:05.109
Company motto, write it down.

04:05.134 --> 04:06.290
- I'm not writing that down.
- It's cool.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.447
Already memorized it.

04:07.797 --> 04:09.001
These people have been putting up

04:09.025 --> 04:10.828
with less than they deserve
for far too long.

04:10.853 --> 04:12.679
Peeling paint, filthy halls.

04:12.797 --> 04:15.031
That sad courtyard that smells like pee.

04:15.056 --> 04:17.000
- Yeah, what is that?
- I think it's pee.

04:17.031 --> 04:18.367
That ends today.

04:18.435 --> 04:21.170
By "today" I hope you mean

04:21.238 --> 04:23.656
"over the course of several months

04:23.710 --> 04:26.008
as we gradually improve the building."

04:26.242 --> 04:27.977
Yes, you're right.

04:28.648 --> 04:31.148
You're right, I've been watching
too much Property Brothers.

04:31.217 --> 04:33.023
- Got to slow my roll.
- Exactly.

04:33.048 --> 04:34.906
- Okay. I'm-a go get the bagels.
- Wait.

04:34.931 --> 04:36.265
- We're serving?
- Hey.

04:36.305 --> 04:38.530
If we're slowing our roll fixing
these crappy apartments,

04:38.554 --> 04:40.453
the least we can do is bring a schmear.

04:40.968 --> 04:42.943
I've been watching too much
Seinfeld, too.

04:51.114 --> 04:52.304
Hey.

04:56.359 --> 04:57.492
What is that?

04:57.517 --> 04:58.695
Nothing. What is what?

04:58.720 --> 05:01.321
You're totally watching porn.

05:01.523 --> 05:03.031
No, I'm not. What?

05:03.047 --> 05:04.789
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

05:04.814 --> 05:06.586
Yes, you are, look at you,
you're getting all red.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.079
- Let me see.
- I am 60 pounds overweight

05:08.103 --> 05:09.445
and Irish, that's my color.

05:09.470 --> 05:10.695
- Let me see.
- No.

05:10.953 --> 05:13.069
- If you're not watching, let me see.
- Stop it. Stop it.

05:13.093 --> 05:14.906
Give me. Thanks.

05:15.195 --> 05:16.341
What is your thing?

05:17.073 --> 05:18.250
- Babysitters?
- No.

05:18.275 --> 05:19.421
- Nurses.
- No.

05:20.211 --> 05:21.878
They're pictures of dogs.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.014
And, uh, links to dog shelters.

05:24.039 --> 05:28.311
And something that resembles
Tinder for dogs?

05:28.336 --> 05:30.269
Yeah, it's Petfinder, okay?

05:30.338 --> 05:32.371
Some people look at vacation rentals,

05:32.440 --> 05:34.679
some people look at porn,
I look at dogs.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.468
Some guy at the office,
he got this cute little doodle.

05:39.906 --> 05:40.959
Aw.

05:40.984 --> 05:42.781
And he's showing everybody
pictures of it.

05:42.850 --> 05:45.918
I went down a puppy rabbit hole,
that's all.

05:47.607 --> 05:50.341
Look, I know that dogs
are a sensitive issue for you.

05:52.257 --> 05:54.070
So, just...

05:56.070 --> 05:57.100
...forget it.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.298
Let me up, I got to get ready for work.

06:05.461 --> 06:07.015
Well, hi, everyone.

06:07.663 --> 06:09.593
- Yeah.
- Hello. My name is Beth Pearson,

06:09.618 --> 06:12.756
and this is my husband and
co-owner, Randall Pearson.

06:12.781 --> 06:14.935
- Hi.
- We are your new landlords.

06:16.095 --> 06:18.132
So we are aware that this building

06:18.157 --> 06:20.524
is in need of significant repairs.

06:20.776 --> 06:23.777
We have listed here

06:23.846 --> 06:24.982
some of our priorities.

06:25.007 --> 06:27.039
Yeah, making money!

06:27.583 --> 06:30.006
No, actually, what we
want to do for all of you

06:30.031 --> 06:31.632
is shore up your fire escapes, okay?

06:31.657 --> 06:33.070
We're gonna bring those up to code.

06:33.095 --> 06:35.257
Maybe I can use mine to jump out
of this hellhole.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.964
Okay, well, I hope not.

06:37.989 --> 06:40.453
Because after fire escapes,
we're gonna start on...

06:40.478 --> 06:42.008
Half the time,
my front door doesn't lock.

06:42.032 --> 06:44.054
- Mm-hmm?
- And half the time, it won't open.

06:44.094 --> 06:46.319
- When we gonna focus on that?
- Okay, that's a good point.

06:46.343 --> 06:48.997
But right now we have to focus
on the major violations.

06:49.065 --> 06:50.585
I can fix your door, Rosemary.

06:52.093 --> 06:53.193
It's just a door.

06:53.218 --> 06:54.303
Think we can handle a door.

06:54.328 --> 06:55.594
Uh, what about my heater, man?

06:55.662 --> 06:57.406
It's banging all the time.

06:57.578 --> 06:59.311
I can fix that, too, Lloyd. Right away.

06:59.380 --> 07:00.940
The-the washing machine needs quarters.

07:02.450 --> 07:04.616
Sure. Oh, wait, one at a time.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.418
- One at a time.
- Hey, don't you think

07:06.487 --> 07:07.698
we're getting
a little ahead of ourselves?

07:07.722 --> 07:09.312
Nah. We got this.

07:12.159 --> 07:13.371
- Water...
- Don't forget the Dumpster.

07:13.395 --> 07:14.500
Right. Dumpster.

07:18.232 --> 07:19.598
Is that the Manny?

07:19.667 --> 07:21.133
Look, it's the Manny.

07:21.202 --> 07:22.968
Uh, guys need a hand?

07:23.171 --> 07:24.970
- Here to help.
- Oh, my God.

07:36.641 --> 07:37.945
Oh, hey, Kev. Good.

07:37.961 --> 07:39.761
- I want you to take a look at this.
- Sorry, I can't.

07:39.763 --> 07:40.995
Mom's got me doing
those stupid college forms.

07:40.997 --> 07:42.430
Ah, it'll just take a second, come on.

07:42.432 --> 07:43.945
I want you to put your eyes on it.

07:44.219 --> 07:45.843
Yeah, I don't know, it looks great.

07:46.555 --> 07:48.195
Kev, you didn't even look at it.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.085
Come on, you used to love this stuff.

07:51.215 --> 07:54.890
Look, now look... the-the TV
is gonna go right here.

07:55.023 --> 07:57.323
I just, I want it to be perfect
before the game.

07:57.812 --> 08:00.159
You know, it's just a...
it's just a bunch of wood, Dad.

08:00.228 --> 08:02.414
- No one... no one cares.
- I care.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.640
I got to do something
to keep my hands busy,

08:06.665 --> 08:09.109
'cause every time
I want to grab a drink,

08:09.134 --> 08:11.109
instead, I just pick up a hammer.

08:17.352 --> 08:19.335
Hey. I'm just here to help, bro.

08:19.866 --> 08:20.812
Thanks, man.

08:20.837 --> 08:22.804
Yeah. "Door"? I can fix a door.

08:22.829 --> 08:25.000
- Rosemary? Oh, Rosemary. Yeah?
- Yes.

08:25.054 --> 08:26.489
- Can I fix your door?
- Kev, you don't have to...

08:26.513 --> 08:28.112
- Yeah, yeah.
- ...do, uh...

08:28.181 --> 08:32.640
Well, thanks for the bagel
and the orangey fish.

08:32.664 --> 08:35.039
- It's smoked salmon, Lloyd.
- Can I just say that you...

08:35.087 --> 08:36.648
Look, I know what you're gonna say.

08:36.967 --> 08:38.289
I didn't slow my roll.

08:38.357 --> 08:39.390
And you're right.

08:39.414 --> 08:40.616
That was a very fast roll.

08:40.642 --> 08:42.327
My roll got its steam by the second.

08:42.395 --> 08:44.062
I was like Sonic the
Hedgehog up in here.

08:44.130 --> 08:45.696
And I know what
you're gonna say next, too.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.866
How are these people gonna feel
when you don't deliver

08:47.934 --> 08:49.906
on everything that you
just promised, Randall?

08:50.212 --> 08:52.512
I just got really excited, Beth.

08:52.839 --> 08:55.373
Like, I suddenly realized
that I can do this.

08:55.442 --> 08:57.342
I built our house. It's the same thing.

08:57.410 --> 09:00.523
My dad was in construction,
it's in my blood.

09:01.234 --> 09:04.249
Well, I guess there's nothing
left for me to say.

09:05.695 --> 09:08.753
I'm gonna go to my office
in time for my 2:00.

09:10.078 --> 09:11.335
Good luck, baby.

09:12.265 --> 09:13.953
- You're gonna need it.
- Uh.

09:15.218 --> 09:17.318
Was that a real "good luck"
or a snarky "good luck"?

09:19.999 --> 09:21.225
All right.

09:21.250 --> 09:22.533
All right.

09:22.796 --> 09:23.851
All right.

09:25.210 --> 09:26.256
All right.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.140
That is actually what they do.

09:28.165 --> 09:30.036
They tell those people when to laugh.

09:30.105 --> 09:31.816
It's called a laugh track,
or whatever. Anyway...

09:31.840 --> 09:33.164
...it's all fake.

09:34.078 --> 09:35.085
That should do it.

09:35.110 --> 09:36.367
Let's check it out.

09:37.992 --> 09:39.392
Look at that. Good as new.

09:39.460 --> 09:40.693
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:40.762 --> 09:42.228
- You are a lifesaver.
- Aw.

09:42.297 --> 09:43.976
Was there anything else
I can do for you while I'm here?

09:44.000 --> 09:46.198
Do you want to knock down a wall?

09:46.423 --> 09:47.489
I'm sorry, what?

09:48.195 --> 09:50.748
My ex put up that wall

09:50.773 --> 09:52.507
- and stole all the light.
- Really?

09:52.532 --> 09:55.039
Yeah. Then he decides to take off,

09:55.064 --> 09:58.011
and I'm stuck here with that damn wall.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.113
Yeah, that's... that's easy.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.751
Yeah, I can, I can
tear that wall down for you.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.211
Oh, uh, no, actually I
was just kidding, I...

10:03.235 --> 10:05.430
No, no. This is great. This is
exactly what I'm supposed to be

10:05.454 --> 10:07.640
doing right now.
It'll keep me busy, so, uh...

10:08.057 --> 10:09.501
Yeah, I'll be right back
with a sledgehammer.

10:09.525 --> 10:10.585
This'll be great.

10:11.727 --> 10:13.660
And then you use the white icing

10:13.729 --> 10:15.203
to make the football seams.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.945
I always do three stitches,
I think that looks best.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.633
Yeah. Looks really nice.

10:19.701 --> 10:20.934
Okay, get excited, people.

10:21.003 --> 10:22.803
T minus three hours...

10:22.871 --> 10:27.040
...until kickoff, and the new
wall unit is finally finished.

10:27.109 --> 10:28.398
Aw, that's great, babe.

10:28.423 --> 10:29.955
Mom, what is my Social Security number?

10:29.979 --> 10:30.998
I'll fill that part out.

10:31.023 --> 10:32.818
You just do all the ones
about your major.

10:32.843 --> 10:35.539
- Got it.
- I heard Sophie applied early to NYU.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.625
- Are you applying there, too?
- No.

10:37.852 --> 10:40.252
Kevin's had to adjust
his plans a little bit.

10:40.321 --> 10:42.662
So, he is applying
to Allegheny Community,

10:42.687 --> 10:44.473
and then once he gets his grades up,

10:44.498 --> 10:46.398
he can transfer
wherever he wants. Right?

10:46.500 --> 10:47.911
Yeah, wherever I want.

10:50.695 --> 10:52.131
He's fine.

10:52.156 --> 10:53.500
It's gonna be fine.

10:53.525 --> 10:55.191
Ugh, I still can't do it.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.304
- You haven't opened it yet?
- Kate.

10:57.329 --> 10:59.687
Nope. What's in this letter
determines my entire future, and I...

10:59.711 --> 11:00.781
- Oh! What?
- Dad!

11:00.806 --> 11:02.523
- Oh!
- Dad. Come on, give it...

11:02.548 --> 11:04.282
- Once I open it. Once it's open... no.
- Dad! Give it back.

11:04.306 --> 11:06.882
- Here it comes, okay. Here it is.
- I want to see.

11:08.521 --> 11:10.000
Okay, please say something.

11:10.611 --> 11:11.710
- No, it's good.
- Yeah.

11:11.735 --> 11:13.335
You're in the final round of applicants.

11:13.367 --> 11:14.554
They want you to submit

11:14.579 --> 11:16.398
an additional audition piece.

11:16.513 --> 11:18.515
Original songs are encouraged.

11:18.652 --> 11:21.210
- Kate! Your original songs are gorgeous.
- What... Oh, hey.

11:21.235 --> 11:22.890
That face? And that voice?

11:22.915 --> 11:24.315
What if... what if I videotaped it?

11:24.492 --> 11:25.609
I'd rather die.

11:25.634 --> 11:27.539
So, I'm just going to send in
an audiotape.

11:28.015 --> 11:29.196
You don't want me to videotape?

11:29.220 --> 11:32.121
- Dad, not happening.
- Okay.

11:35.354 --> 11:38.601
Last Pearson Super Bowl is
getting off to an angsty start.

11:39.773 --> 11:42.242
- At least Randall still likes us.
- Mm.

11:43.382 --> 11:45.030
I think he likes Allison more.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.843
You get used to the noise.

12:45.562 --> 12:47.617
So many choices.

12:47.757 --> 12:50.421
- You ever had a dog?
- Yeah, when I was a kid.

12:50.593 --> 12:54.031
He came right up to our front
door and I just had to keep him.

12:54.056 --> 12:55.140
Aw, what kind?

12:55.165 --> 12:57.390
Oh, he was a little terrier mix.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.210
We got a few of those, if that's
what you're in the market for.

12:59.234 --> 13:00.484
You know, I don't know.

13:00.509 --> 13:02.935
I'm just browsing.
My fiancé wants a dog,

13:02.960 --> 13:05.148
but I can't quite wrap
my head around it.

13:12.039 --> 13:13.193
Who is this?

13:13.218 --> 13:14.367
That's Audio.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.937
We found him in the back
of a Trader Joe's in Echo Park.

13:18.241 --> 13:20.375
- Is he friendly?
- He's the sweetest.

13:20.437 --> 13:22.598
I'd adopt him myself,
but I already got two dogs

13:22.623 --> 13:24.334
and if I bring home another one,
my wife's gonna kill me.

13:24.358 --> 13:25.624
You want to meet him?

13:25.693 --> 13:27.062
Yes. Yes.

13:28.148 --> 13:29.328
Come on, man.

13:29.968 --> 13:31.897
- Come on.
- Hi, buddy.

13:31.966 --> 13:33.312
Hi, Audio.

13:34.828 --> 13:36.769
Oh, my goodness.

13:36.837 --> 13:38.804

14:12.494 --> 14:14.439
- I almost got the whole thing.
- Dad, I told you,

14:14.463 --> 14:15.395
I don't want to be on camera.

14:15.464 --> 14:17.023
This was just for you.

14:17.367 --> 14:19.273
Look, come on.
I-I thought that, you know,

14:19.298 --> 14:21.268
if you saw how great you were,

14:21.336 --> 14:23.250
you'd reconsider sending in a video.

14:23.281 --> 14:25.085
Thanks. As if this
isn't stressful enough.

14:25.110 --> 14:27.428
Oh, c-come on.
You can't be mad at me today.

14:27.453 --> 14:29.265
All right? It's Super Bowl Sunday.

14:30.379 --> 14:32.304
Yeah, sure. Take her side.

14:33.960 --> 14:34.961
Hey.

14:34.986 --> 14:36.346
The game's gonna be starting soon.

14:37.015 --> 14:39.257
Allison really isn't into football.

14:39.516 --> 14:41.789
I think we're gonna go see
Titanic if that's okay.

14:41.814 --> 14:42.891
You know, it's her favorite movie.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.382
She's seen it, like, six times.

14:45.078 --> 14:47.322
So, you're gonna miss the Super Bowl

14:47.391 --> 14:50.225
to take Allison to go see
Titanic for the seventh time?

14:50.445 --> 14:52.984
Uh, it's just, you know,
we haven't gone on a...

14:53.733 --> 14:55.164
a real date yet.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.533
Okay.

14:59.234 --> 15:00.501
Yeah, sure.

15:00.570 --> 15:01.636
You should go.

15:01.705 --> 15:02.904
- For real?
- Yeah.

15:03.378 --> 15:04.593
You should go.

15:05.311 --> 15:06.554
Thank you.

15:19.102 --> 15:20.203
Kate.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.367
The game is about to start, if you...

15:27.429 --> 15:29.070
Kate, I'm sorry.

15:30.171 --> 15:31.859
I know I shouldn't have done that.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.284
But it would break my heart

15:35.286 --> 15:37.389
if you didn't want to be on camera

15:37.414 --> 15:39.428
because you don't realize
how beautiful you are.

15:39.453 --> 15:40.690
Dad, stop.

15:41.718 --> 15:43.046
Just...

15:44.773 --> 15:48.500
You saying stuff like that to me
was fine when I was a kid.

15:49.929 --> 15:51.937
But I'm older now, and I just...

15:52.835 --> 15:55.304
I just, I don't see myself
the way you see me.

15:55.867 --> 15:59.070
And, you know, no one else
sees me that way, either.

15:59.781 --> 16:02.359
So, you saying it all the time...

16:04.141 --> 16:05.340
..it just hurts.

16:05.409 --> 16:06.585
- Katie.
- No, Dad.

16:07.110 --> 16:08.476
I need you to stop.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.593
Okay?

16:10.522 --> 16:11.671
Okay.

16:12.750 --> 16:14.664
All right, just wait
till I get some sandpaper

16:14.689 --> 16:16.108
before you put anything on top of it.

16:16.132 --> 16:17.109
- Cool.
- Hey.

16:17.134 --> 16:18.156
What's up?

16:19.304 --> 16:20.359
Hey, babe.

16:20.429 --> 16:22.625
Uh, I don't want to say "I told you so."

16:22.693 --> 16:25.460
Really? 'Cause it sounds
like you called just to say it.

16:25.570 --> 16:27.959
You know the expression
"Rome wasn't built in a day"?

16:27.984 --> 16:30.545
Okay. I see you're really gonna
make a meal out of this.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.470
Well, there's a new expression in town:

16:32.539 --> 16:35.185
our apartment building
was rebuilt in a day.

16:35.210 --> 16:37.625
- Randall!
- Yeah? Hold on one sec.

16:38.150 --> 16:39.390
What's going on?

16:40.085 --> 16:41.351
Geez!

16:41.376 --> 16:44.453
They are coming out
of the hole you left.

16:44.610 --> 16:45.776
Oh.

16:46.234 --> 16:48.058
Ah, I need to call you back.

16:48.273 --> 16:49.742
Trouble in Rome, Caesar?

16:49.767 --> 16:51.533
Something came up. Love you. Bye.

16:52.164 --> 16:54.125
Oh, come on.

16:56.071 --> 16:58.843
Ah! Ah, perfect. Okay.

17:03.171 --> 17:05.125
Hey. Hey, Soph.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.983
Yeah, I was trying you all weekend.

17:08.973 --> 17:10.125
Wow.

17:12.140 --> 17:13.817
Yeah, you found out yesterday?

17:14.804 --> 17:16.319
Yeah. Totally.

17:16.492 --> 17:18.664
Go celebrate with your parents.
It's fine.

17:19.811 --> 17:21.265
Congratulations, Soph.

17:22.358 --> 17:23.656
I love you.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.906
It sounds like Sophie got into NYU.

17:33.804 --> 17:34.851
Yep.

17:35.442 --> 17:36.648
She did.

17:37.296 --> 17:39.148
- It's awesome.
- It is.

17:40.750 --> 17:43.320
But it's also probably
pretty hard to think about her

17:43.345 --> 17:45.429
going so far away, especially since...

17:45.454 --> 17:46.531
Since I'm going nowhere.

17:46.556 --> 17:48.734
No, that's not what
I was gonna say, Kevin.

17:48.765 --> 17:50.616
You do realize there's nothing wrong

17:50.685 --> 17:52.304
with starting out at community college.

17:52.329 --> 17:53.726
You're right. It's very exciting.

17:54.004 --> 17:55.218
What's going on?

17:55.257 --> 17:58.343
Kevin just found out
that Sophie got into NYU.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.687
- Hey.
- Yeah.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.750
But he's a little frustrated.

18:01.775 --> 18:03.820
Yeah, no, I'm not frustrated.
I'm pissed.

18:04.165 --> 18:06.478
I'm pissed that my life sucks
so hard and Mom won't shut up

18:06.502 --> 18:07.930
- about community college.
- Excuse me?

18:07.954 --> 18:09.513
Hey, do not talk to
your mother that way.

18:09.537 --> 18:10.843
Don't you guys get it?

18:11.149 --> 18:12.813
I was supposed to end up
in the Super Bowl,

18:12.837 --> 18:14.340
not watch it like you guys.

18:14.987 --> 18:16.343
What's your point, Kevin?

18:19.476 --> 18:20.890
Damn it, I didn't want to do this.

18:20.915 --> 18:22.304
- Kevin.
- No, it's okay.

18:22.458 --> 18:23.859
Kevin's the worst again.

18:24.452 --> 18:26.273
Order's restored to the universe.

18:27.348 --> 18:28.742
I'm gonna go to Sophie's.

18:31.926 --> 18:33.703

19:37.532 --> 19:38.726
Pretty often.

19:38.838 --> 19:41.343
Yeah. I'm a singer,
so my schedule is flexible.

19:41.856 --> 19:43.468
Yeah, a little too flexible.

19:43.493 --> 19:46.039
So if you know anyone
who wants to be sung to...

19:46.064 --> 19:47.445
Audio loves music.

19:47.577 --> 19:50.210
- That's why we named him Audio.
- Oh.

19:50.985 --> 19:52.040
Well, look, I think you guys

19:52.064 --> 19:53.544
would make an amazing home for Audio.

19:54.139 --> 19:55.539
Yeah, I think we would.

19:56.039 --> 19:59.140
Toby was pretty much born
to have a dog, so...

19:59.304 --> 20:00.453
What about you?

20:01.321 --> 20:04.101
Yeah, I was pretty much born
to have a dog, too.

20:04.468 --> 20:05.672
All right. Well, we're all set here.

20:05.696 --> 20:07.251
Let me get the vaccination
report. I'll be right back.

20:07.275 --> 20:08.992
- All right?
- Okay. Thank you.

20:19.283 --> 20:20.609
Hey, bud.

20:34.593 --> 20:36.046
This isn't gonna work.

20:37.765 --> 20:40.359
I want it to so badly, but...

20:41.135 --> 20:42.929
it's just not gonna.

20:44.580 --> 20:46.585
But someone's gonna come get you.

20:48.342 --> 20:49.945
But I can't keep you.

20:50.773 --> 20:53.187
And you have to understand that...

20:53.212 --> 20:56.315
...you come with a lot of
baggage that isn't your fault.

20:56.845 --> 20:58.062
It's not.

21:08.257 --> 21:09.765
I can't...

21:10.570 --> 21:12.125
I'm sorry.

21:16.648 --> 21:18.257
How long are we gonna be there?

21:18.282 --> 21:20.078
Uh, depends on the exterminator.

21:20.211 --> 21:22.046
Two nights, tops, I hope.

21:22.945 --> 21:25.281
You want them to be dead,
not wounded, right?

21:25.437 --> 21:28.389
Evicted, day one. Nice work.

21:28.414 --> 21:29.690
It's not an eviction, Lloyd.

21:29.759 --> 21:31.154
It's a relocation.

21:31.179 --> 21:32.578
Hey, have you seen my brother?

21:33.078 --> 21:34.662
So... has anybody seen the Manny?

21:34.995 --> 21:36.093
- Kev?
- Yeah?

21:36.328 --> 21:37.341
We got to go, man.

21:37.366 --> 21:38.686
Roach guys are gonna tent the building.

21:38.710 --> 21:40.164
20 more minutes, all right?

21:41.796 --> 21:44.506
Hey, man, I'm not one
to complain about free labor,

21:44.531 --> 21:46.064
but is everything okay?

21:46.710 --> 21:48.466
Yeah. Yeah, everything's good.

21:48.535 --> 21:50.289
I'm just trying to, you know, stay busy.

21:50.645 --> 21:53.750
Find a project, complete
the project, stay sober.

21:55.296 --> 21:56.382
Okay.

21:57.789 --> 22:00.132
Well, we got a few minutes
before the roaches get us.

22:00.836 --> 22:03.812
Or before we find out
this wall was load-bearing.

22:07.367 --> 22:08.968
I'm supposed to be making amends.

22:11.484 --> 22:12.927
Crossing names off of lists.

22:12.952 --> 22:14.518
And I have. I've-I've squared things

22:14.543 --> 22:15.742
with people that I've hurt.

22:18.609 --> 22:20.406
There are a few people
that I don't think

22:22.156 --> 22:23.981
I'm gonna be able to square
things up with, though,

22:24.005 --> 22:25.343
so I just figured, uh...

22:26.843 --> 22:28.601
the wall's easier, you know?

22:29.461 --> 22:30.703
Yeah.

22:33.179 --> 22:34.979
Do you remember Dad?

22:35.687 --> 22:37.804
When he made his amends
with us that night?

22:38.430 --> 22:40.945
And he had a... a list in his hand.

22:41.128 --> 22:43.094
Some notes or something,
I remember that.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.429
Yeah.

22:48.914 --> 22:50.203
You'll get there, Kev.

22:51.251 --> 22:53.046
We all got our stuff.

22:55.437 --> 22:57.580
- How about you, huh?
- What about me?

22:57.649 --> 22:59.427
Well, what are you doing?
I mean, you're doing, like,

22:59.451 --> 23:01.217
a month's worth of repairs in a day.

23:01.286 --> 23:03.397
You're doing it all by yourself,
with no help from anyone.

23:03.421 --> 23:05.578
I mean, you got actor help,
but basically that's like,

23:05.603 --> 23:07.296
- you know, no help.
- Yeah...

23:09.501 --> 23:12.273
I'm almost 40 years old
and I'm starting a new career.

23:13.273 --> 23:14.601
That's late, man.

23:15.710 --> 23:17.968
I feel like I'm already
running out of time.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.651
Running out of ti... come on,
we're the same age, man.

23:20.726 --> 23:22.338
Right? And don't say 40, all right?

23:22.407 --> 23:23.484
Actor.

23:23.645 --> 23:25.578
You ever think of
yourself as an old man?

23:27.312 --> 23:30.781
Like, sometimes I try, and I can't.

23:33.377 --> 23:37.031
I think it's hard to picture
myself outliving Dad, you know?

23:39.625 --> 23:41.135
You got a few years
before you got to start

23:41.159 --> 23:43.159
- worrying about that, right?
- It goes quick, bro.

23:44.015 --> 23:45.898
He's already been gone for 20 years.

23:46.802 --> 23:49.296
He's already been gone
longer than we had him.

24:01.328 --> 24:03.125
- I think you should do it.
- Do what?

24:03.226 --> 24:04.547
Picture yourself as an old man.

24:06.171 --> 24:08.710
'Cause you're not going anywhere
any time soon, right?

24:08.875 --> 24:10.586
Okay? I mean, look at you.
You got your health,

24:10.610 --> 24:12.510
you got a-a beautiful family.

24:12.578 --> 24:14.529
You got a tough-as-nails, kick-ass wife

24:14.554 --> 24:17.210
who literally will not
let you die on her.

24:17.367 --> 24:18.749
You're not going anywhere.

24:19.286 --> 24:21.343
You're gonna be a great
old man, by the way.

24:23.682 --> 24:25.398
You'll be like your other dad.

24:35.563 --> 24:36.937
Hey... Bec?

24:36.962 --> 24:38.862
Hey, the pre-game is starting!

24:42.867 --> 24:43.828
Hey.

24:43.853 --> 24:46.523
Hey. Your brothers both abandoned ship,

24:46.548 --> 24:48.437
so just means more room for us, right?

24:50.411 --> 24:52.109
I watched the tape.

24:53.093 --> 24:55.328
<i>And then on the other side of that...</i>

24:55.353 --> 24:56.382
Okay.

24:57.657 --> 24:58.945
Don't ever stop.

25:01.124 --> 25:03.671
Don't stop trying to...

25:05.046 --> 25:09.500
to make me see myself
the way you see me.

25:11.058 --> 25:12.882
<i>But remember
Terrell Davis is a guy that...</i>

25:13.177 --> 25:14.421
Okay, Katie girl.

25:14.885 --> 25:16.093
I won't stop.

25:17.205 --> 25:19.839
<i>And now, with his
two-week period of time off,</i>

25:19.908 --> 25:21.281
<i>his shoulder, his ribs...</i>

25:23.382 --> 25:26.156
Um, is it cool if I go
to Molly's house, actually?

25:26.181 --> 25:28.305
She's having, like, a bunch of
people over to watch the game.

25:28.329 --> 25:30.617
- Yeah. Yeah, go have fun.
- Okay.

25:30.642 --> 25:32.442
It's not like the Steelers
are on this year.

25:32.467 --> 25:35.328
All right, um, then I'm gonna go, Dad.

25:35.353 --> 25:36.726
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

25:37.048 --> 25:38.257
This looks great, by the way.

25:38.282 --> 25:39.234
Thank you.

25:39.306 --> 25:41.796
Ah, just in time
for some Super Bowl chili.

25:41.821 --> 25:43.656
Mmm, yum. Bye, Mom.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.445
Party at Molly's.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.132
Here.

25:49.350 --> 25:50.609
- You got it?
- Yep.

25:57.157 --> 25:58.781
Hmm.

25:59.283 --> 26:01.550
<i>...the times he's played
on this field, he has never...</i>

26:01.575 --> 26:04.117
Hey, babe. Do you want one of these?
They're still warm.

26:04.951 --> 26:07.625
Um. No, I'm fine.

26:07.650 --> 26:10.078
No, Jack, I'm trying to do
something cute here.

26:10.103 --> 26:11.359
Can you take a corn muffin?

26:11.384 --> 26:13.070
Okay.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.320
- What is that?
- I don't know.

26:20.345 --> 26:21.445
What is that?

26:25.359 --> 26:28.341
"Single family home, three
bedroom, one and a half bath..."

26:28.409 --> 26:30.271
It just, it jumped out at me.

26:30.296 --> 26:31.577
- Huh.
- One owner,

26:31.646 --> 26:34.113
an elderly couple, so it needs
a little bit of updating,

26:34.182 --> 26:36.015
but the bones of it are so good.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.217
And I know when you get in there
and work your magic,

26:38.286 --> 26:40.882
you can flip it,
make twice as much money.

26:41.445 --> 26:43.515
- Yeah, that's a great idea.
- Hmm.

26:43.540 --> 26:45.515
Yeah, I'll, uh, I'll
call in the morning.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.515
I may have
already left them a message...

26:48.880 --> 26:51.453
the real estate agent...
'cause I got a little excited.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.421
Be my business partner.

26:58.171 --> 27:01.007
- What?
- Do this with me, be my partner.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.834
Sweetheart, I-I just was
trying to be helpful,

27:04.859 --> 27:06.679
- you don't have to...
- I'm not.

27:07.783 --> 27:09.937
I'm not doing anything
I wouldn't want to.

27:16.523 --> 27:17.790
It's...

27:18.710 --> 27:19.976
I mean...

27:22.320 --> 27:25.097
I did run this household for 18 years,

27:25.166 --> 27:27.670
and when we did our remodel here...

27:27.695 --> 27:30.062
- You handled everything.
- Yeah.

27:30.087 --> 27:32.303
You did the design, you
handled the finances.

27:32.328 --> 27:33.609
Everything, babe.

27:34.679 --> 27:35.796
Come on.

27:37.585 --> 27:38.611
Yeah.

27:39.468 --> 27:40.789
Yeah, I mean,

27:41.171 --> 27:43.889
this could be our home office.

27:43.914 --> 27:45.904
- Yeah.
- Oh, babe,

27:45.929 --> 27:48.234
I've always wanted a partner's desk.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.497
Hey, you know?

27:51.724 --> 27:53.310
You know what I've always wanted?

27:54.647 --> 27:56.080
An office with a view.

28:14.810 --> 28:16.414
Oh, wait, hold it. You know what?

28:16.439 --> 28:17.818
We can't have sex in the office.

28:17.843 --> 28:19.388
That would be unprofessional. Come on.

28:42.529 --> 28:43.818
Here you go, ladies.

28:43.843 --> 28:45.643
Hopefully, this will
warm you up a little bit.

28:45.645 --> 28:47.045
- Thank you.
- I'm so sorry.

28:47.047 --> 28:49.427
There's cookies, guys,
if you... want 'em.

28:51.193 --> 28:52.794
Hey.

28:53.676 --> 28:54.755
Hey.

28:54.943 --> 28:57.426
I am just waiting
for some rooms to clear.

28:57.451 --> 28:58.654
Good.

29:00.735 --> 29:01.834
Go ahead.

29:02.043 --> 29:03.339
Say "I told you so."

29:03.364 --> 29:04.568
I'm not gonna say that.

29:06.232 --> 29:08.278
I am gonna say, "You always
start with pest control."

29:08.302 --> 29:10.183
- Okay.
- And you always start with pest control

29:10.208 --> 29:11.934
because you don't want to go
busting through a bunch

29:11.958 --> 29:14.080
of drywall when you have
a building filled with roaches.

29:14.104 --> 29:14.863
That...

29:14.888 --> 29:17.257
And then you're gonna
say, "That makes sense."

29:17.282 --> 29:19.226
And then you're gonna say
something charming about how

29:19.250 --> 29:21.318
much you love me, and it's gonna
almost get you off the hook, but

29:21.342 --> 29:22.834
you know what's really
gonna get you off the hook?

29:22.858 --> 29:23.840
No, what?

29:23.865 --> 29:26.188
It's when you say, "I've never
owned a building before.

29:26.458 --> 29:27.857
But my partner here,

29:27.926 --> 29:29.766
she's been working
with underserved communities

29:29.827 --> 29:31.183
her entire career.

29:31.208 --> 29:33.029
She's a real resource to me.

29:33.097 --> 29:34.630
I'm gonna utilize my resource."

29:34.857 --> 29:36.777
I sound smarter when you do me
than when I do me.

29:36.801 --> 29:38.444
Yeah, well, that's why it's fun.

29:38.469 --> 29:42.348
I... I got freaked out
about running out of time.

29:42.373 --> 29:43.505
Yeah. Look.

29:43.530 --> 29:45.763
This just can't just be
R & B Properties, Randall,

29:45.788 --> 29:48.068
it's got to be smooth R & B, okay?

29:48.216 --> 29:51.122
Slow your roll.

29:51.147 --> 29:53.414
My roll has been slowed.

29:54.513 --> 29:56.085
Now, can I say that charming thing

29:56.154 --> 29:57.849
- about how much I love you now?
- Oh...

29:58.450 --> 30:00.154
- 'Cause I do.
- Get a room!

30:00.179 --> 30:02.365
Hey, what can I say, man?
I love my wife.

30:02.390 --> 30:05.349
I mean, for me, a room.
I need some sleep.

30:05.374 --> 30:06.662
No, I knew that.
I'm gonna go get you a...

30:06.686 --> 30:07.974
Yeah, you should get him a...

30:15.935 --> 30:17.036
Hello?

30:17.061 --> 30:18.200
Hi, Mom.

30:18.711 --> 30:20.211
Hi, Kev.

30:20.529 --> 30:24.357
Uh, what I said, um, before...

30:25.342 --> 30:26.607
I didn't mean it.

30:26.632 --> 30:27.591
I just...

30:27.616 --> 30:29.536
Yeah, I know. It's okay, sweetheart.

30:30.513 --> 30:31.935
Is Dad mad?

30:32.068 --> 30:36.630
Mm, no, he's not mad, but
I think his feelings are hurt.

30:36.655 --> 30:39.083
Why don't you just come home

30:39.108 --> 30:40.874
and watch the end of the game with him?

30:40.926 --> 30:43.107
I think I'm just gonna stay
at Sophie's tonight.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.279
- Kev.
- It's fine, her mom's home.

30:45.304 --> 30:46.630
I'll sleep on the couch.

30:47.015 --> 30:48.646
Do you want to talk to your dad?

30:48.793 --> 30:51.536
Um, no, I'll just talk to him tomorrow.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.069
All right. Good night, sweetheart.

30:54.094 --> 30:55.271
Good night.

31:03.911 --> 31:05.122
No.

31:10.224 --> 31:12.622
I heard there was some party
in the woods tonight.

31:24.974 --> 31:26.185
Should I move?

31:27.146 --> 31:28.255
Is this the way

31:28.280 --> 31:29.842
that you're trying to tell me
that I should move?

31:29.866 --> 31:31.661
Can you give me a second, please?

31:33.549 --> 31:34.622
Are you okay?

31:35.193 --> 31:36.263
I'm okay.

31:42.789 --> 31:46.154
I didn't see it... Kevin.

31:46.179 --> 31:48.107
I'm a nurse and I didn't even see it.

31:48.132 --> 31:50.013
- No. No, no, the...
- I didn't see it.

31:54.126 --> 31:56.849
You know, you're the only man
that I ever truly loved.

31:57.696 --> 32:00.771
But you're the only man
that's ever been able

32:00.796 --> 32:02.044
to hurt me the way that you do.

32:02.069 --> 32:03.943
- I never meant to hurt you.
- No, I know.

32:05.233 --> 32:06.583
I know, but you did.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.263
And we tried again.

32:10.083 --> 32:12.085
We tried to squeeze a puzzle piece in

32:12.154 --> 32:14.263
because it fit once when we were kids.

32:15.404 --> 32:17.388
You know, if you really want
to make amends...

32:20.213 --> 32:22.482
...could you just leave me
with something?

32:23.474 --> 32:25.622
Just leave me with the past.

32:26.599 --> 32:27.771
And just...

32:28.937 --> 32:32.435
let me remember you at-at-at ten

32:33.003 --> 32:35.104
or at 17 or 20.

32:37.154 --> 32:40.146
Just let me remember you
when-when it was good.

32:41.728 --> 32:43.911
Okay? Can you do that?

32:50.458 --> 32:52.592
Well, you can check my name
off your list.

32:52.661 --> 32:55.325
You know, you can do it with
a clear conscience because...

32:56.294 --> 32:57.607
because I forgive you.

32:58.958 --> 33:00.708
- Soph...
- No, listen, I already...

33:00.733 --> 33:01.865
I'm sorry.

33:05.052 --> 33:07.849
I want you to know that y-you
weren't just a name on my list.

33:10.050 --> 33:11.692
Soph, you were the name.

33:22.197 --> 33:23.638
Good-bye, Kevin.

33:39.974 --> 33:41.324
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

33:41.349 --> 33:43.130
Ah, see, look. Huh?

33:43.466 --> 33:45.247
No porn, no puppies.

33:45.638 --> 33:46.810
No puppy porn.

33:46.835 --> 33:48.060
How was your day?

33:49.442 --> 33:50.536
Interesting.

33:50.561 --> 33:51.646
Oh, yeah. Why is that?

33:51.687 --> 33:54.356
Well, I went to the dog shelter.

33:54.381 --> 33:55.732
You know the rescue that I found

33:55.757 --> 33:57.247

- Yeah?

33:57.272 --> 34:00.200
Yeah, and I saw the cutest,
the cutest dog.

34:00.225 --> 34:01.193
And, like, crazy cute.

34:01.218 --> 34:04.166
Like "if Jacob Tremblay was a dog" cute.

34:04.191 --> 34:05.825
- My God.
- Yeah.

34:05.850 --> 34:07.083
A Jacob Tremblay dog?

34:07.108 --> 34:10.224
- I wanted to surprise you with him.
- Yeah?

34:10.309 --> 34:12.599
But then I started thinking
about having a dog

34:13.114 --> 34:15.199
and how that would remind me
every day...

34:15.225 --> 34:17.638
Oh, yeah. No, no.

34:17.663 --> 34:19.755
Don't-don't, don't worry about it.
I to... I totally get it.

34:19.780 --> 34:21.083
It's-it's totally fine.

34:21.108 --> 34:22.279
But then on the drive home,

34:22.643 --> 34:23.909
I couldn't stop thinking

34:23.976 --> 34:25.844
about how happy the dog would make you.

34:26.255 --> 34:27.779
What are you saying, woman?

34:34.077 --> 34:35.692
Oh, my...

34:37.443 --> 34:38.474
Hi.

34:38.607 --> 34:40.177
Hi.

34:41.099 --> 34:42.918
Oh, what is your name?

34:42.943 --> 34:44.793
Say "Audio." Uh, we can change it

34:44.819 --> 34:45.985
if you don't like it.

34:46.010 --> 34:47.342
- Audio?
- Yeah.

34:47.367 --> 34:48.654
No, I love it.

34:48.679 --> 34:52.129
It's like some weird, obnoxious
celebrity baby name.

34:52.154 --> 34:53.974
Come here. Oh.

34:56.560 --> 34:59.411
Oh, he does look like Jacob Tremblay.

34:59.904 --> 35:01.480
Aw.

35:01.548 --> 35:02.974
Aw.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.372
Hey.

36:45.285 --> 36:46.669
I thought you were Kevin.

36:46.758 --> 36:47.950
Nope.

36:48.655 --> 36:50.036
Hand me a glass, bud.

36:50.693 --> 36:51.825
Thanks.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.271
So, how was the movie?

37:06.826 --> 37:08.130
It was fine.

37:09.696 --> 37:11.865
Hmm. All right.

37:17.341 --> 37:18.552
Actually...

37:19.872 --> 37:20.982
it was great.

37:21.755 --> 37:23.130
We kissed.

37:25.411 --> 37:26.504
Look at you.

37:26.529 --> 37:27.678
Finally.

37:27.794 --> 37:29.046
I'm sure you were a gentleman.

37:29.871 --> 37:30.982
Yeah.

37:31.908 --> 37:32.950
Good.

37:38.622 --> 37:40.615
- Night, Dad.
- Night, bud.

38:35.758 --> 38:40.169
_

39:23.839 --> 39:25.802
George, we got a call.

39:26.091 --> 39:27.755
Somebody wants to come see the house,

39:27.780 --> 39:29.740
and the Realtor said
they're a really nice couple.

39:30.073 --> 39:32.950
Oh, that's... that's great.

39:32.975 --> 39:34.294
- Yeah.
- Yes.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.083
Honey.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.497
We'll get new stuff.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.474
New stuff for a new house.

39:42.499 --> 39:43.732
Yeah?

39:44.112 --> 39:45.521
Yeah.

40:11.155 --> 40:13.055
Hey, George. What's up?

40:13.123 --> 40:15.083
Well, we finally got a nibble
on the house.

40:15.108 --> 40:16.599
- Congrats. That's great.
- Yeah.

40:16.624 --> 40:17.865
Cleaning out the garage.

40:17.890 --> 40:19.443
- All right.
- Hey, George.

40:19.468 --> 40:21.368
- How's Sally?
- Sweet as ever.

40:21.999 --> 40:23.372
I thought I'd bring this over.

40:23.818 --> 40:25.146
- Thank you.
- Okay.

40:25.810 --> 40:27.803
- Wow.
- Only two years old, but there's a lot

40:27.872 --> 40:29.249
of great family meals
been cooked in that.

40:29.273 --> 40:30.873
How nice is that?

40:30.941 --> 40:33.363
You got to fiddle
with the switch, but it works.

40:33.388 --> 40:35.668
Thank you, George, we appreciate
you thinking of us.

40:35.693 --> 40:37.092
That's so nice. Thank you.
