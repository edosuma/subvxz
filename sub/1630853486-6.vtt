Pilot and flight engineer

16:27.779 --> 16:32.409
Died in Pasadena, California,
July 12th, 2068.

16:32.409 --> 16:33.869
- How did this happen?

16:33.869 --> 16:35.746
- Well, we think we know,
because in fact,

16:35.746 --> 16:37.456
we've seen it before.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.166
ISAAC: As you will recall,

16:39.166 --> 16:42.461
when Commander Grayson's younger self
was transported to our time,

16:42.461 --> 16:44.838
we were able to confirm
that human cognition

16:44.838 --> 16:47.090
played a role
in the temporal displacement.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.760
LAMARR: We think we're looking
at a similar explanation here.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.887
The other night at the party,
Charly was asking Gordon

16:51.887 --> 16:53.889
about the cellular phone in his quarters.

16:53.889 --> 16:55.349
Got him talking about Laura.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.434
Now, we're still
just beginning to understand

16:57.434 --> 17:00.479
the relationship between temporal theory
and observer perception,

17:00.479 --> 17:03.482
but the short of it is,
Gordon was close to the Aronov device

17:03.482 --> 17:05.108
when we overloaded the deflectors.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.152
The burst of energy
from the quantum drive

17:07.152 --> 17:09.238
amplified the temporal field
before it collapsed,

17:09.238 --> 17:11.782
and he got caught
in the displacement wave.

17:11.782 --> 17:13.825
I might be off base, but my bet

17:13.825 --> 17:17.788
is that his subconscious
picked that destination point:

17:17.788 --> 17:19.289
the early 21st century.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.125
- So he's... trapped in the past?

17:22.125 --> 17:23.836
- He was.

17:23.836 --> 17:27.339
According to these records,
he lived and died back there.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.508
- So... if that's the case,

17:29.508 --> 17:31.552
it must mean we weren't able to save him.

17:31.552 --> 17:34.763
- She is correct.
We have already failed.

17:34.763 --> 17:35.931
- Not necessarily.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.350
See, that's where
temporal mechanics gets muddy.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.685
It's all in flux.

17:39.685 --> 17:42.354
ISAAC:
Our behavior is, as yet, a variable.

17:42.354 --> 17:45.983
Until and if we make the attempt
to rescue Lt. Malloy,

17:45.983 --> 17:49.987
we are existing in a superposition
of several possible timelines.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.572
- Then he can be rescued.

17:51.572 --> 17:54.575
- But... why is there any record
of him at all?

17:54.575 --> 17:55.826
He knows the law.

17:55.826 --> 17:59.454
If you find yourself displaced in time,
you make yourself as invisible as you can.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.498
You do everything
in your power not to interfere.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.625
- Now that, I can't answer.

18:03.625 --> 18:07.379
- Is it possible for us to go back
and get him?

18:08.463 --> 18:10.507
- With the upgrades to the Aronov device

18:10.507 --> 18:12.885
and the temporal coordinates
Gordon sent us in the message,

18:12.885 --> 18:14.052

But it's gonna put a hell of a strain
on the quantum drive.

I am able to direct a geodetic probe
