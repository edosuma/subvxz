21:44.346 --> 21:46.305
Guess I can drop the case, huh?

21:47.741 --> 21:49.743
You're fishing
in the wrong pond.

21:49.786 --> 21:50.744
This saw

21:50.787 --> 21:52.615
was used
to carve up Shaw's body.

21:52.659 --> 21:55.226
We have your fingerprints on
file from your last arrest

21:55.270 --> 21:57.794
and also here.
On the butt of the handle.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.581
We don't have
to do this here.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.931
I'm not leaving this property
unless you drag me off it.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.498
I gave that saw

22:05.541 --> 22:06.586
to Shaw.

22:06.629 --> 22:07.978
Because you were
such good buddies?

22:08.022 --> 22:10.198
Because I was trying
to do business with the man.

22:10.241 --> 22:13.114
That's the way it worked.
You got to ply him with money,

22:13.157 --> 22:14.376
swag.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.683
I needed his space
for our convention.

22:16.726 --> 22:20.077
So my prints on that saw
don't prove a thing.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.731
Hmm, this might.

22:21.775 --> 22:22.993
Another present
you gave to Shaw?

22:24.212 --> 22:28.042
[chuckles softly] Miss,
that ammo is store-bought ammo.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.827
I melt mine here.

22:31.915 --> 22:33.395
Course, I'm gonna need to see

22:33.439 --> 22:35.702
a warrant
before I let you tour my armory.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.008
We'll get one.

22:44.667 --> 22:47.278
[muffled speaking]

22:47.322 --> 22:49.977
You get your house in order now.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.983
Dr. Grissom.

22:56.026 --> 22:59.813
Let me guess. You want to know
why we called Janice Woo.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.815
Mr. Wix is upset?

23:01.858 --> 23:03.904
What the hell's going on?We needed some assistance

23:03.947 --> 23:05.645
in fingerprint duplication.

23:05.688 --> 23:08.212
How many outside experts
does this lab need?

23:08.256 --> 23:10.780
One more, evidently.You thought
it would be a good idea

23:10.824 --> 23:13.653
to recruit the woman who's gonna
testify against your buddy?

23:13.696 --> 23:16.307
Well, she's
an expert forensic artist.

23:16.351 --> 23:19.049
Well, if you ask me,
it's awfully suspicious.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.357
I didn't ask you.

23:32.193 --> 23:34.369
[exhales]

23:34.413 --> 23:36.893
When I got married
the second time,

23:36.937 --> 23:39.809
Melinda and I
got ring tattoos.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.769
Just to be safe.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.336
Where'd you two meet?

23:45.380 --> 23:47.164
At one of her shows.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.253
She's a fire performer.

23:49.297 --> 23:51.386
Juggles it. Eats it.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.780
Never really cooks with it,

23:53.823 --> 23:54.911
but...[laughs]

23:54.955 --> 23:55.999
Her job is why

23:56.043 --> 23:57.174
we moved to Vegas.

23:57.218 --> 23:58.393
You moved here for her career?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.090
Yeah.

24:00.134 --> 24:02.441
I was...
I was happy in New York.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.834
Had some momentum
in the art scene.

24:04.878 --> 24:07.184
Nice boss at the morgue.

24:07.228 --> 24:11.319
But she had to be here for
work, so we took the plunge.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.364
Looks like you got
something there.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.807
They're teeth.

24:20.850 --> 24:23.200
No roots. Veneers.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.942
You know, the porcelain
they use on fake teeth

24:25.986 --> 24:29.076
resist acid just like
the chompers we're born with.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.121
Bet we'll find the
rest of them in there.

24:35.256 --> 24:37.084
SIDLE:
Erik Shaw's smile was natural.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.957
These must've come
from our second decedent.Odontologists

24:41.001 --> 24:44.178
have to take a 3D intraoral scan

24:44.221 --> 24:47.268
to make all those.I should do
a bite reconstruction.

24:47.311 --> 24:48.965
RAMIREZ:
You should find Folsom.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.054
He's good at those.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.883
♪

25:06.417 --> 25:09.159
The veneers are really
well-made. High quality.

25:09.203 --> 25:11.292
Figure we shoot that model
to all the best odontologists

25:11.335 --> 25:13.816
in the area, and...

25:13.860 --> 25:17.254
we can cross our fingers and...

25:19.300 --> 25:20.431
What?

25:20.475 --> 25:21.781
FOLSOM:
Nothing. It's...

25:21.824 --> 25:22.912
It's just...

25:22.956 --> 25:24.566
It's a really familiar
smile, right?

25:24.610 --> 25:26.916
I swear I've...

25:26.960 --> 25:28.570
Hold on.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.317
That sure looks like

25:36.360 --> 25:38.362
the same smile, right?Yeah.

25:38.406 --> 25:39.973
Our second decedent
is Chase Starr.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.975
Makes sense. His name's

25:42.018 --> 25:44.281
all over one of the lawsuits
against Erik Shaw.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.457
That man is alive. I met him

25:46.501 --> 25:48.111
when I interviewed
Tammy Shaw.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.331
Big, old, bright
Donny Osmond smile.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.334
Well, if Chase Starr

25:53.377 --> 25:56.119
is alive, he can't also be
down Erik Shaw's drain.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.213
McKenzie, what is going on
with that sashay?

26:03.257 --> 26:06.477
It's one, two, three.

26:06.521 --> 26:09.524
[pop music playing faintly]

26:09.568 --> 26:12.527
Mr. Starr.
It's good to see you again.Folks,

26:12.571 --> 26:16.183
this is a closed rehearsal.We'll make it quick, Grayson.

26:17.445 --> 26:21.188
You lied to us the other day.
You said your name was Chase.

26:21.231 --> 26:22.885
I'm sorry,
who told you it wasn't?

26:22.929 --> 26:25.105
I'm-I'm just confused here.RAJAN:
Did you know

26:25.148 --> 26:27.455
identical twins don't have
identical fingerprints?

26:27.498 --> 26:31.590
Those are formed in the womb,
where you met this guy.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.247
All right, yeah, I'm Grayson.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.989
I-I'm filling in for my brother.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.296
"Filling in"? That's...

26:42.339 --> 26:43.471
That's not a thing.

26:43.514 --> 26:45.038
Identity theft is. Murder is.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.169
WOMAN:
Hi, Chase.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.608
All right, uh,
what you might could find out

26:49.651 --> 26:53.176
is one of the mamas
has a restraining order

26:53.220 --> 26:55.396
against me.
She's not here today, so I'm not

26:55.439 --> 26:56.876
in-in violation.

26:56.919 --> 26:59.574
But I'm not supposed to cover
for Chase anymore.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.315
What was I supposed to do?

27:01.358 --> 27:04.231
He disappeared right before
our biggest event of the year.

27:04.274 --> 27:05.972
That's the only reason
you're impersonating the man?

27:06.015 --> 27:07.974
Because the show must go on?

27:08.017 --> 27:09.366
Go ahead and mock,

27:09.410 --> 27:11.586
but these kids have worked
their entire little lives

27:11.630 --> 27:13.066
to compete in this pageant.

27:13.109 --> 27:14.458
Why didn't you let
the authorities know

27:14.502 --> 27:15.590
that Chase was missing?

27:15.634 --> 27:18.114
You don't want me
to waste your time.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.900
It's pills. It's always pills.

27:20.943 --> 27:22.423
Last time, I found him

27:22.466 --> 27:26.035
detoxing in some ashram
in the Mojave. He'll turn up.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.952
I'm so sorry, Mr. Starr,

27:29.996 --> 27:31.606
but, um...

27:31.650 --> 27:33.477
your brother's dead.

27:33.521 --> 27:36.132
What?FOLSOM:
We were able

27:36.176 --> 27:37.917
to confirm with dental records.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.267
He-he...We have the same dentist.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.964
Are-are you sure?

How?

27:50.973 --> 27:53.280
Wh-Where did this happen?FOLSOM:
We're gonna answer

27:53.323 --> 27:54.716
your questions, but first,

27:54.760 --> 27:56.675
we're gonna have
to ask you some.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.026
Where were you two nights ago?Um,

28:00.069 --> 28:01.288
I was here.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.637
I was covering for Chase.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.988
I was helping a-a few kids
with their routines.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.208
Which families?GRAYSON:
Um,

28:08.251 --> 28:11.690
the Sizemores, the Otts.
Tammy Shaw and her girls.

28:15.302 --> 28:18.958
Chase was in those pipes, too?

28:19.001 --> 28:21.961
[exhales]It's possible he had a hand
in your husband's murder.

28:22.004 --> 28:24.746

but...RAJAN: We found part
of a .45-caliber bullet

28:26.792 --> 28:28.228

Mr. Starr has a weapon
of the same caliber

28:30.404 --> 28:31.492
registered in his name.

28:31.535 --> 28:32.754
Which Mr. Starr?

28:34.364 --> 28:36.323
Chase. But we...

28:36.366 --> 28:39.326
But we want to ask
you about Grayson.

28:39.369 --> 28:43.417
He suggested you might be able
to alibi him for Tuesday night.

28:43.460 --> 28:47.029
We were here for extra practice
with Grayson.

28:47.073 --> 28:48.291
We left

28:48.335 --> 28:51.512
after Carrie's run-through,
but he stayed.

28:51.555 --> 28:53.688
Well, if you knew that Grayson

28:53.732 --> 28:55.646
was filling in for Chase,
why didn't you tell us

28:55.690 --> 28:57.213
the other day?It's none of my business.

28:58.171 --> 29:00.260
What, you think I want problems

29:00.303 --> 29:01.696
with the heads of the
pageant? [chuckles]

29:03.567 --> 29:04.743
What happened
to your leg there?

It looks like a chemical burn.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.747
No.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.401
It was this.

29:11.445 --> 29:14.796
That looks more like
an exothermic ulcer

29:14.840 --> 29:19.018
than a hot glue mishap.I was putting rhinestones
on Quinn's shoes.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.541
It hurt

29:20.584 --> 29:22.282

do you like that!

You're lucky, Ms. Shaw.

30:03.105 --> 30:05.368
The burn on your leg
could've been much worse.

30:05.412 --> 30:07.544
Sulfuric acid is no joke.

30:07.588 --> 30:10.112
I told you that I burned myself
with a glue gun.

Tammy, uh,

30:15.248 --> 30:16.640
where did you go

30:16.684 --> 30:18.425
after your rehearsal
with Grayson the other night?

30:18.468 --> 30:20.819
Home to put my daughters to bed.

30:20.862 --> 30:21.863
And after that?

30:21.907 --> 30:23.822

Wix's trash day

30:23.865 --> 30:25.562
tomorrow.

30:25.606 --> 30:30.263
Yeah, well, looks like they
got this covered, so I'll go.

30:30.306 --> 30:31.742
No, you know what? You stay.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.527
Finish it.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.273
What-what does that
have to do with anything?

30:40.316 --> 30:41.317
You knew both victims.

30:41.361 --> 30:43.363
And you had access
to the chemicals

that dissolved them. Sulfuric
