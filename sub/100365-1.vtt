WEBVTT

01:39.516 --> 01:41.935
Turbo boost!

01:42.019 --> 01:45.689
The joint starts jumpin' every night
When the sun goes down

01:47.024 --> 01:48.275
Kabir, don't ride the cart!

01:50.027 --> 01:51.486
That wasn't me!

01:52.446 --> 01:58.493
It's where all the cowboy folk
Go to boot scootin' boogie

01:58.577 --> 02:00.621
Okay. Ready for another pile?

02:03.207 --> 02:05.918
Oh, yeah. Are you ready?

02:06.001 --> 02:07.002
Yeah!

02:07.085 --> 02:09.794
I fire up my pickup truck

02:14.760 --> 02:17.304
Welcome to the Economy Value Inn,
Green River.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.723
My name is Kabir. How may I help you?

02:20.098 --> 02:21.683
You're the concierge? That's amazing.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.311
I'm not the concierge, sir. I'm reception.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.396
-My bad.
-Well, then, sir.

02:26.480 --> 02:29.650
Might you point me in the direction
of your finest dining establishment?

02:29.733 --> 02:31.693
Have you ever had fried chicken?

02:32.069 --> 02:33.862
My favorite is KFC.

02:33.946 --> 02:36.573
That's short for "Kentucky Fried Chicken."

02:36.657 --> 02:39.576
And it's actually right here
in Green River.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.119
I'm so sorry.

02:41.203 --> 02:43.247
Kabir, go to your father.
Do your homework.

02:43.789 --> 02:47.459
Just a heads-up. Don't bother asking
for the Colonel. He's never there.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.461
Go inside.

02:49.545 --> 02:50.921
That's one precocious kid.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.130
How may I help you?

02:52.214 --> 02:54.174
Do you know a good place
to eat around here?

02:54.258 --> 02:55.801
-There's a Pancake House...
-Dad.

02:56.468 --> 02:57.719
What's "precocious" mean?

02:58.971 --> 03:00.138
Look it up in a dictionary.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.682
Where's the dictionary?

03:02.558 --> 03:03.600
Up there.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.354
I got that dictionary
when I first came to this country.

03:08.814 --> 03:11.108
Whenever I didn't know a word,
I would look it up.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.694
And once I learned it,
I'd highlight it with a marker.

03:14.069 --> 03:16.238
It doesn't look like
you learned many words.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.615
Just look up your word, hey?

03:19.116 --> 03:23.871
"Of a child having developed certain
abilities at an earlier age than usual."

03:26.290 --> 03:30.210
I saw a kid changing for gym
who might be precocious.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.921
Here.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.300
Precocious.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.302
Precocious.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.683
Okay. Ready, Seema?

03:45.309 --> 03:46.602
-Watch this! You watch this.
-Yeah.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.103
Okay. Here we go.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.191
Yes!

03:52.274 --> 03:53.984
How'd you hit it so far?

04:00.157 --> 04:02.159
How did you do that, hey?
How'd you do that?

04:04.119 --> 04:06.872
Tendulkar. Hey!

04:08.707 --> 04:10.709
Welcome to KFC. Can I take your order?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.253
Three chicken sandwich value meals,
please.

04:13.337 --> 04:14.963
And three Pepsis, please.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.716
Soda on a school night? Cool.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.764
She should leave this idiot, Sandip,
for Rohit.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.307
No, she shouldn't.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.475
She's crazy.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.685
Ma. Do you know "albumen"?

04:29.019 --> 04:31.396
-What's an albumen?
-"The white part of an egg."

04:32.356 --> 04:34.608
I'll still call it
"the white part of an egg."

04:34.691 --> 04:39.738
Dad said he'd buy me a Trans Am
if I learned every word in the dictionary.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.490
Now you're buying him a car?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.700
Dad and I crunched the numbers.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.369
How many words?

04:45.452 --> 04:48.330
Webster's has 460,000 words.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.958
Only 460,000.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.043
And I have until I'm 16.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.087
Boom! Trans Am!

04:55.462 --> 04:57.339
A-A-A-A.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.966
N-N-N-N.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.510
A-A-A-A. A-A-A-A.

05:01.593 --> 05:03.428
A-A-A-A.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.681
C-C-C-C. C-C-C-C.

05:05.764 --> 05:07.140
C-C-C-C.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.351
H-H-H-H. R-R-R-R.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.478
O-O-O-O. N-N-N-N.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.021
I-I-I-I.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.649
S-M.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.401
Anachronism!

05:21.530 --> 05:23.824
Kabir, one, two, three.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.454
Remember, tighten the corners.

05:29.538 --> 05:30.998
That's right.

05:31.582 --> 05:32.791
Good job.

05:32.875 --> 05:33.876
Dactylic.

05:34.710 --> 05:38.922
D-A-C-T-Y-L-I-C. Dactylic.

05:41.550 --> 05:47.890
A-R-R-H-Y-T-H-M-I-A.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.433
Arrhythmia.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.226
Excuse me.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.479
Hi. I'm looking for Krish Jha.

05:56.732 --> 06:00.027
Dad, this lady was looking for you.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.613
Hi. I'm Miss Dubeck.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.782
Miss Dubeck, I'm Krishan Jha.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.117
Thank you so much for coming.

06:07.201 --> 06:08.535
-Please, come in.
-All right.

06:08.619 --> 06:11.038
Would you like any tea or coffee?

06:11.121 --> 06:12.497
No, thanks.

06:12.831 --> 06:16.210
Kabir, here. Come. You man the desk.
And study your words.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.337
This way.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.216
This is my wife, Seema.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.300
Hello.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.969
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Jha.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.388
Mr. and Mrs. Jha, I wish...

06:29.431 --> 06:31.308
I was coming with better news.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.101
But right now,

06:34.019 --> 06:37.189
it looks like
we're looking at it possibly being

06:37.272 --> 06:39.107
extradition and deportation.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.264
Our cab's here.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.266
Don't forget to have
breakfast every morning.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.143
-Vijay.
-Bye.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.604
Bye.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.108
This is my friend
I was telling you about.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.234
And this is Kabir.

07:22.317 --> 07:24.945
He's going to take good care of you
and the motel while we're away.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.446
You're clear on everything?

07:27.865 --> 07:28.866
Thank you.

07:29.074 --> 07:32.077
Yeah. I'm between jobs anyway now.
Helps both of us.

07:32.995 --> 07:34.329
Go. Say bye to your parents.

07:34.413 --> 07:35.414
Oh, okay.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.130
Hello.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.632
We'll only be gone a short time,

07:45.883 --> 07:47.676
until we get our papers sorted out.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.054
And I've given Vijay some money
to keep an eye on you.

07:51.763 --> 07:52.764
Okay?

07:53.974 --> 07:57.477
We'll call you every night. I promise.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.815
Skype. We'll Skype. It's free.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.737
Don't cry, Ma. I'll see you soon.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.324
I'll water your plants every day.

08:10.407 --> 08:11.408
-Come.
-Okay.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.876
I'll see you soon!

08:35.933 --> 08:37.267
You have a light, man?

08:37.351 --> 08:38.602
I'm 12.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.520
I don't need your whole life story.

08:41.772 --> 08:43.106
This place is a dump.

08:43.774 --> 08:47.402
No, it's not. It's the number-three
midrange motel in Green River, Utah.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.696
You should know that
if you're gonna be the manager.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.323
I'm not managing this place.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.992
I'm just here to make sure you don't die.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.786
Then who's the manager?

08:56.578 --> 08:57.704
You are, little man.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.722
Oh, show me your science fair project.
It's tomorrow, no?

09:18.642 --> 09:19.685
Wow. What is that?

09:20.269 --> 09:22.062
It's a homemade lava lamp.

09:22.354 --> 09:25.482
Welcome to the Economy Value Inn.
How may I assist you today?

09:28.527 --> 09:29.695
Know who I am?

09:29.778 --> 09:30.779
Batman.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.239
What are you gonna be for Halloween?

09:32.906 --> 09:33.949
A FedEx driver.

09:35.617 --> 09:36.869
Did the plumber come?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.412
I scheduled him for tomorrow.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.496
Good.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.463
Why are you always looking in that thing?

09:48.547 --> 09:52.134
If I learn every word,
Dad's buying me a Trans Am.

09:52.217 --> 09:55.721
Should've asked for a Porsche.
Trans Am is a trash auto.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.306
What's wrong with you, Beta?

09:57.806 --> 10:00.726
You've been gone for four months.
What's going on?

10:01.185 --> 10:04.563
Your mother and I are writing letters
every day to the proper offices.

10:04.646 --> 10:05.814
Every day.

10:08.400 --> 10:09.484
Who you waiting on now?

10:09.568 --> 10:11.236
Department of Homeland Security.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.946
They oversee immigration.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.907
I've written to them 14 times.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.828
As a federal employee,
I can say with confidence

10:19.912 --> 10:22.748
that writing to the government
is a giant waste of time.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.377
It's a bureaucratic issue.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.837
But it's your fault this happened.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.089
You lack prospicience.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.717
That means "foresight."

10:33.800 --> 10:35.093
These things take time.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.054
Everything is good at home?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.138
Yeah.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.641
Any news from your parents?

10:42.017 --> 10:43.310
These things take time.

10:44.353 --> 10:46.813
I am praying for them
every Sunday at church.

10:47.898 --> 10:48.899
Thanks.

10:50.484 --> 10:54.112
You know, Kabir, every year
you win the school spelling bee.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.367
Have you thought about competing
at the state competition at Salt Lake?

10:59.868 --> 11:01.161
I bet you'd win.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.705
And then you could go to Nationals.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.582
I mean, think about it.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.043
Have you ever been to Washington, DC?

11:09.545 --> 11:11.713
You know,
the finalists meet the First Lady.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.382
Wouldn't that be something?

11:14.758 --> 11:15.759
Ms. Wren...

11:16.760 --> 11:19.429
I run an Economy Value Inn off Route 22.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.516
We're the third-ranked motel
in Green River, according to TripAdvisor,

11:22.599 --> 11:24.101
and I'd like to keep it that way.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.436
I don't have time for spelling bees.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.022
Just thought I'd ask.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.901
I told you. The government
doesn't give a shit about you.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.903
Yes, they do. They have to.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.031
Only if they think you're dangerous.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.326
You know, every time
you write one of these agencies,

11:41.410 --> 11:42.578
your name goes on a list.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.290
-What else am I supposed to do?
-Maybe you go straight to the top.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.625
Write to President Bush.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.461
Maybe he'll help you.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.548
Seems like a solid guy
to have a beer with.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.804
Logorrhea.

12:00.888 --> 12:05.976
L-O-G-O-R-H-E-A.

12:06.268 --> 12:07.352
Logorrhea.

12:11.857 --> 12:16.278
Kabir, for the state championship
and the opportunity to attend

12:16.361 --> 12:19.615
the Keys All-American Spelling Bee
in Washington, DC...

12:20.449 --> 12:22.910
can you spell "prospicience"?

12:24.494 --> 12:27.122
But you have to take me to DC.
I can't go without a chaperone.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.417
I don't have to do shit.
I'm not taking you to DC.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.836
Can't you at least lie to my teacher
and say you're gonna take me?

12:33.212 --> 12:34.671
I'll get there on my own.

12:34.755 --> 12:36.882
That would open me up
to criminal prosecution.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.968
Unless you were to make it worth my while.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.386
I don't have money.

12:42.221 --> 12:44.431
But didn't you just win
a gift card to Applebee's?

12:45.557 --> 12:46.558
Asshole.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.644
-Come again?
-Asshole.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.438
Yeah, we're pulling into DC now,
Mrs. Wren.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.732
Kabir, look. The Washington Memorial.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.568
You two are going to have so much fun.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.111
I know we are, Mrs. Wren.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.239
If Kab-- No.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.866
When Kabir meets Laura Bush,

13:02.950 --> 13:04.701
tell her I'm a huge fan.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.286
I'll be sure to do that.

13:07.246 --> 13:08.247
See you soon.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.045
This must be the number one hotel in DC.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.256
Definitely not.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.050
Wow. Great sprinkler system.

13:20.551 --> 13:21.927
What year did you put this in?

13:22.344 --> 13:23.595
I'm not sure.

13:27.391 --> 13:28.433
Cool.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.394
Kohler Whitehaven sinks.

13:31.645 --> 13:32.729
Impressive.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.443
Let us know if you-- your--

13:38.652 --> 13:40.362
your parents need anything else.

13:40.904 --> 13:41.905
Yeah.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.783
A SentrySafe in every room?

13:47.286 --> 13:49.288
Great facilities you have here.

13:49.371 --> 13:50.497
Thank you.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.791
I manage a motel back home.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.334
Okay.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.587
Thank you for your service.

13:57.796 --> 13:58.797
Good luck.

14:11.894 --> 14:12.936

16:14.349 --> 16:16.518
I saw some of the words that you spelled,

16:16.602 --> 16:19.354
and I know
I could never spell those words.

16:20.355 --> 16:23.025
You are all so very impressive.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.818
Why don't we go around the circle

16:24.902 --> 16:26.945
and you could tell me your name
and where you're from?

16:27.404 --> 16:28.697
Let's start with you.

16:29.865 --> 16:32.492
It's okay, honey. Just-- What's your name?

16:33.035 --> 16:35.037
Kabir. Kabir Jha.

16:35.412 --> 16:38.123
Well, hello, Kabir. Where are you from?

16:45.422 --> 16:46.965
"Dear Ms. First Lady Laura Bush,

16:47.049 --> 16:50.052
it is a great honor to be here with you,
but I must ask for you to help me.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.179
My parents have both
been sent back to India

16:52.262 --> 16:54.973
while they are awaiting asylum here
in the United States.

16:55.057 --> 16:57.935
They have already been gone
for more than a year and I miss them.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.895
And they are good people,
you must believe me.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.980
And, please, I know you are a good woman.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.107
Can you please help me get them back?

17:04.816 --> 17:06.733
Sincerely, Kabir Jha."

17:09.069 --> 17:12.531
Dear,
I'm so sorry you're going through this.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.409
Can you help me?

17:16.203 --> 17:19.915
Well, you see, these things,
they're very complicated.

17:20.499 --> 17:22.960
And they just sometimes take a long time.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.377
That's what everyone says.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.882
Why don't you write a letter to my office?

17:35.556 --> 17:37.140
I'm very sorry, Kabir.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.437
Okay. So who's next?

17:42.688 --> 17:44.898
How about you? What is your name?

17:45.440 --> 17:48.735
I'm Grace Colmer from Omaha, Nebraska.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.370
Kabir Jha.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.706
You look pretty young
to be a motel manager.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.749
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.879
Yeah. I'm snaking a drain.

18:08.589 --> 18:09.923
This place is a dump.

18:10.007 --> 18:13.594
Well, maybe next time
don't brush your hair in the sink.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.262
You have a good one.

18:17.181 --> 18:22.394
If I had to choose just one day

18:22.853 --> 18:25.981
To live within my heart

18:26.607 --> 18:27.649
Shelton.

18:29.651 --> 18:30.652
Shelton.

18:31.069 --> 18:32.404
Sir?

18:32.487 --> 18:34.656
Just try to remember.
Don't go against the grain, okay?

18:34.740 --> 18:36.783
Oh, yeah, yeah. I gotcha. I gotcha.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.494
I'm really more of an auditory learner.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.039
-That's fine.
-Yeah.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.248
I got faith in you.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.251
You know, you're gonna be
assistant manager here someday.

18:46.793 --> 18:47.794
Yeah?

18:49.296 --> 18:50.297
All right.

18:51.089 --> 18:56.261
If I had to choose just one day

18:56.553 --> 18:58.847
To live within my...

18:58.931 --> 19:01.225
-Oh, come on, you can do better than that.
-Dude, I'm trying.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.644
-I can't beat him. Oh, my God.
-This is your fifth time. Come on.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.020
You lose.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.731
Yo, what happened to your weirdo uncle?

19:08.941 --> 19:10.150
He's not my uncle.

19:10.567 --> 19:14.488
And he's in Salt Lake
cooking in some fancy restaurant.

19:15.197 --> 19:18.617
Hey, Kabir, Stephanie's parents
came home from their trip early.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.953
Everyone wants to know
if they can come here to hang.

19:21.870 --> 19:25.332
Yeah, yeah, should be fine.
As long as it's just them, okay?

19:25.415 --> 19:26.416
We're good to go.

19:27.125 --> 19:29.920
-Trying to run a business here.
-It's just a few girls.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.807
Dude. Dude, dude, dude.
Could you do that outside?

19:41.890 --> 19:44.184
I'm sorry. It's just--
It's a nonsmoking room.

19:44.268 --> 19:45.936
The guests get all weird about the smell--

19:46.019 --> 19:47.104
Just Febreze it.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.805
Mr. Jha? I'm sorry,

21:04.473 --> 21:06.850
but I was wondering
if you want me to clean?

21:08.685 --> 21:10.896
No. No, I'll do it.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.357
-I can help.
-It's okay, I got it.

21:13.732 --> 21:16.401
Okay. Have a nice day.

22:44.239 --> 22:45.240
Hello.

23:12.226 --> 23:14.853
Mr. Davidson, please
see the ticket agent at gate three.

23:14.937 --> 23:17.439
Mr. Davidson,
please see the ticket agent at gate three.

23:30.202 --> 23:32.454
At this time,
we will now be boarding passengers

23:32.538 --> 23:34.790
seated in rows ten through 20.

23:56.562 --> 23:57.646
Beta.

24:17.708 --> 24:19.084
Who's this man?

24:20.586 --> 24:22.004
-Here you go, sir.
-Next, please.

24:22.087 --> 24:23.255
Next customer. Register two.

24:23.338 --> 24:27.009
Hi, we'll have three chicken sandwich
combo meals and three Pepsis.

24:27.092 --> 24:30.012
Daddy won't have any Pepsi.
He will have water.

24:31.013 --> 24:32.014
Diabetes.

24:32.598 --> 24:33.807
You have diabetes?

24:35.142 --> 24:36.143
Two Pepsis.

24:36.226 --> 24:38.228
Actually, even I won't have any Pepsi.

24:38.312 --> 24:39.980
I'm going to sit down.

24:44.401 --> 24:45.527
One Pepsi.

25:04.046 --> 25:05.172
-I made that.
-Very nice.

25:05.255 --> 25:07.090
Welcome. I'm Shelton.

25:07.674 --> 25:08.675
Nice to meet you.

25:08.759 --> 25:09.760
Likewise.

25:11.845 --> 25:12.971
Where is Margaret?

25:13.347 --> 25:15.182
Mom, she hasn't worked here in forever.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.895
-Hello.
-Hello.

25:22.898 --> 25:24.024
Computers?

25:24.608 --> 25:27.444
Yeah,
it's a business center for the guests.

25:28.529 --> 25:29.530
Nice touch.

25:30.322 --> 25:31.365
Very nice.

25:33.659 --> 25:35.369
We are home.

26:21.957 --> 26:23.208
What are you guys doing up?

26:26.170 --> 26:27.838
Jet lag, you know. Couldn't sleep.

26:28.547 --> 26:29.798
Too much excitement.

26:31.300 --> 26:32.551
-Come on.
-Sit.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.444
Beta, how's your life?

26:58.911 --> 27:00.370
You have a good life?

27:03.790 --> 27:05.000
It's fine.

27:07.461 --> 27:08.462
How about you?

27:12.090 --> 27:13.300
It's better now.
