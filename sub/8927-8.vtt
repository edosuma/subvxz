00:11.230 --> 00:12.980
<i>When you return, are
you going to explain to Peter</i>

00:13.066 --> 00:14.698
what it is you're trying
to accomplish here?

00:14.784 --> 00:16.784
A Nassau
that can self-govern.

00:16.819 --> 00:18.579
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with,

00:18.621 --> 00:20.237
- that I can negotiate with.
- Of course you can.

00:20.323 --> 00:23.374
Because you will have just presented
him with his only daughter.

00:23.459 --> 00:25.659
I can only scavenge
leads for so long.

00:25.711 --> 00:28.162
I have an appetite for
something larger than that.

00:28.214 --> 00:30.414
<i>For this, I need
a partner I can trust.</i>

00:30.500 --> 00:32.750
<i>A launch landed on
the beach a short while ago.</i>

00:32.835 --> 00:35.219
They told Flint the gold was gone.
What did they tell you?

00:35.304 --> 00:37.388
The Urca gold
is on that beach.

00:37.473 --> 00:40.007
<i>It is almost
entirely undefended.</i>

00:40.059 --> 00:43.310
Do you know of a crew who might be
willing to aid in this endeavor?

00:43.346 --> 00:45.146
<i>Abigail, you are
no longer a hostage.</i>

00:45.181 --> 00:46.461
<i>I'm going to
get you out of here.</i>

00:46.482 --> 00:47.681
<i>So, what's the plan?</i>

00:47.767 --> 00:49.100
Leave me to answer
for this among the men?

00:49.185 --> 00:53.737
My death sentence.
You will hear from me again.

00:53.823 --> 00:56.574
- You're Captain Flint?
<i>-  My name is James.</i>

00:56.659 --> 00:58.075
James McGraw.

<i>It's all right.
You're all right.</i>

02:56.229 --> 02:58.445
<i>I'm here.</i>

03:04.036 --> 03:06.120
Shh, shh.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.661
Shh.

03:37.987 --> 03:40.654
No! No!

03:40.690 --> 03:43.073
No! No!

03:45.995 --> 03:48.195
Shh, it's all right.
I'm here.

03:48.247 --> 03:50.948
Shh, you're all right.

03:56.505 --> 04:01.208
<i>Last night was
the first of my journey home.</i>

04:01.260 --> 04:05.212
<i>Still, my dreams are haunted
by the faces of those pirates</i>

04:05.264 --> 04:06.880
<i>that first captured me.</i>

04:13.723 --> 04:15.973
<i>Now I
find myself in the custody</i>

04:16.058 --> 04:18.642
<i>of another band
of pirates.</i>

04:18.728 --> 04:20.861
<i>I'm told
they're different,</i>

04:20.896 --> 04:23.731
<i>and I will say
that so far these men</i>

04:23.783 --> 04:27.568
<i>have treated me civilly,
even courteously.</i>

04:27.653 --> 04:32.072
<i>They've even afforded me the
tools to keep this journal.</i>

04:32.158 --> 04:33.991
<i>And though they will
almost certainly</i>

04:34.076 --> 04:36.910
<i>destroy these pages
before we disembark,</i>

04:36.996 --> 04:38.879
<i>eliminating any record</i>

04:38.914 --> 04:42.082
<i>of their activities
or their identities...</i>

04:43.419 --> 04:46.553
<i>just the act of putting
my thoughts to paper</i>

04:46.589 --> 04:49.723
<i>has helped me
feel myself again.</i>

04:49.759 --> 04:52.676
<i>To construct for myself
an illusion</i>

04:52.762 --> 04:55.262
<i>that I'm still
on the Good Fortune</i>

04:55.348 --> 04:58.482
<i>nearing the end
of a long voyage,</i>

04:58.567 --> 05:02.436
<i>recent events were themselves
the nightmare,</i>

05:02.488 --> 05:05.105
<i>and that these men
are simply sailors</i>

05:05.157 --> 05:07.408
<i>tasked with
delivering me home.</i>

05:09.862 --> 05:11.195
Get off me, I tell you!
I'll kill you!

05:11.280 --> 05:13.414
Hey, hey, come on!
Stop, you!

05:13.449 --> 05:15.199
<i>I said cut it out.</i>

05:15.284 --> 05:17.368
<i>I don't know who started it,
but it stops right now.</i>

05:17.453 --> 05:19.586
<i>Take him away!
Get back to work!</i>

05:19.622 --> 05:21.622
<i>But it is only an illusion.</i>

05:24.460 --> 05:27.511
<i>And a fragile one at that.</i>

05:33.018 --> 05:35.135
<i>My father
told me about these men,</i>

05:35.187 --> 05:38.272
<i>about their natures,</i>

05:38.307 --> 05:41.809
<i>so I know that any appearance
of civility from them</i>

05:41.894 --> 05:44.778
<i>is but a glimpse
of the men they once were.</i>

05:44.814 --> 05:48.949
<i>A ghost that shows itself
only while the darker things</i>

05:48.984 --> 05:53.070
<i>that now govern
their souls lay dormant.</i>

05:53.155 --> 05:55.038
<i>Though I'm forced to wonder</i>

05:55.124 --> 05:58.158
<i>if this illusion
is no accident at all,</i>

05:58.210 --> 06:00.411
<i>but theater
for my benefit,</i>

06:00.496 --> 06:03.414
<i>orchestrated
by someone so awful,</i>

06:03.499 --> 06:06.333
<i>even monsters such as these
have no choice</i>

06:06.385 --> 06:09.636
<i>but to dance to the tune
he plays for them.</i>

06:11.757 --> 06:13.891
<i>Which leads me
to the one thought</i>

06:13.976 --> 06:15.976
<i>I find most frightening</i>

06:16.011 --> 06:18.562
<i>and most difficult
to dismiss.</i>

06:18.647 --> 06:22.232
<i>What happens if that man
decides the theater</i>

06:22.318 --> 06:25.352
<i>no longer
serves his purposes</i>

06:25.404 --> 06:27.571
<i>and he lets
the monsters loose?</i>

06:37.366 --> 06:38.749
Everything all right?

06:40.619 --> 06:43.120
Yes.

06:43.205 --> 06:44.838
I'm all right.

06:55.267 --> 06:57.468
She was
writing about me.

06:57.553 --> 06:59.553
Do you think?

06:59.638 --> 07:02.222
I suppose
I can't blame her.

07:02.274 --> 07:04.858
A girl her age with what
she's been through.

07:04.894 --> 07:07.528
It's a credit to her that
she can function at all.

07:09.565 --> 07:11.732
Look at her.

07:11.817 --> 07:13.784
<i>When I first learned
she was on the island,</i>

07:13.869 --> 07:17.204
<i>I saw in my mind
a five-year-old child</i>

07:17.239 --> 07:19.373
<i>hiding behind
her mother's dress.</i>

07:19.408 --> 07:21.375
Then I saw her.

07:23.162 --> 07:26.380
I realized
she's a woman.

07:26.415 --> 07:28.749
<i>It's like she's
some sort of clock</i>

07:28.801 --> 07:30.751
<i>that's finally
struck its chime</i>

07:30.803 --> 07:34.588
<i>and woken me from this
dream we've been living,</i>

07:34.640 --> 07:38.926
<i>reminded me how many
years separate me</i>

07:39.011 --> 07:41.144
from a world
I still think of as home.

07:44.183 --> 07:46.650
How unrecognizable
the woman I am now

07:46.735 --> 07:49.937
would be to the woman
I was then.

07:58.581 --> 08:01.999
I recognize you.

08:02.084 --> 08:04.418
You recognize me?

08:04.453 --> 08:06.787
Yes.

08:06.839 --> 08:09.172
So that's in our favor.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.764
The question is...

08:17.800 --> 08:20.634
will Peter recognize
either one of us?

08:26.692 --> 08:28.642
Five million pieces.

08:28.694 --> 08:32.111
Five million
fucking pieces.

08:32.147 --> 08:34.280
Five million pieces.

08:36.702 --> 08:37.985
Jesus Christ.

09:01.677 --> 09:03.510
How in the fuck

09:03.562 --> 09:05.596
am I supposed
to prepare to carry

09:05.681 --> 09:08.015
five million pieces
of eight across an ocean

09:08.100 --> 09:09.900
without anybody
knowing I'm doing it?!

09:09.985 --> 09:11.935
I don't know, but perhaps if
you asked a little louder,

09:12.021 --> 09:15.355
there might be someone on
the moon who could help you.

09:15.407 --> 09:18.609
Why don't we lower our
voices and begin again?

09:18.694 --> 09:21.028
Have you begun the men
clearing the ship's hold?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.696
Everything that
isn't bolted down

09:22.781 --> 09:24.414
is being moved
onto the sand.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.700
I told him
I needed to refigure

09:26.785 --> 09:28.368
how she was
carrying her weight.

09:28.454 --> 09:30.587
- Is that something one does?
- No.

09:30.673 --> 09:33.874
It's all I could think of given
that there's no good reason

09:33.959 --> 09:36.043
to empty a ship
while she's in the bay

09:36.095 --> 09:39.129
unless you're making room to fill
that space with something else.

09:39.214 --> 09:41.254
"Oi, Featherstone, what is
it we're making space for

09:41.300 --> 09:42.599
by emptying
all this stuff?"

09:42.685 --> 09:44.205
"Oh, nothing, gents.
I just want to..."

09:44.219 --> 09:45.719
Try to refigure how she's
carrying her weight?

09:45.804 --> 09:48.221
"...refigure how she's
carrying her weight," exactly.

09:48.273 --> 09:50.557
Fuck!

09:50.643 --> 09:53.060
Even if somehow
we can set sail

09:53.145 --> 09:55.729
<i>to retrieve this gold
without anyone knowing it,</i>

09:55.814 --> 09:58.982
even if the intelligence is correct
and the gold is retrievable,

09:59.068 --> 10:01.818
we haven't even begun
to address the issue

10:01.904 --> 10:03.236
of where we'll put
all that gold,

10:03.288 --> 10:05.539
much less defend it.

10:05.574 --> 10:07.574
I mean...

10:07.660 --> 10:10.327
is this really something
we're capable of doing?

10:10.412 --> 10:13.413
- Yes.
- Yes?

10:13.465 --> 10:18.085
Yes, we are capable
of doing this and more.

10:18.137 --> 10:21.555
We will have that prize,
Mr. Featherstone.

10:21.590 --> 10:25.809
We've all come too far to let an
opportunity like this pass us by.

10:25.894 --> 10:27.477
Would you not agree?

10:27.563 --> 10:29.479
I humbly suggest

10:29.565 --> 10:31.481
you continue
unloading the hold.

10:31.567 --> 10:34.434
By the time anyone
expects to reload it,

10:34.486 --> 10:38.238
you will be close enough to departure
to tell them the truth, yes?

10:52.171 --> 10:54.454
Is it possible
for two men

10:54.506 --> 10:56.373
days removed
from unending wealth

10:56.458 --> 10:58.041
to be any less happy?

11:01.263 --> 11:05.098
All right, I can see
that you are angry.

11:06.518 --> 11:08.685
But are you angry
with Anne for leaving

11:08.771 --> 11:12.022
or are you angry with me for
offering her the opportunity?

11:12.107 --> 11:14.641
It would help me to understand
with which I am dealing.

11:22.317 --> 11:25.152
For so many years,
I knew her.

11:25.237 --> 11:27.537
Perhaps the only one
who truly knew her.

11:30.659 --> 11:32.826
But for weeks, with everything
we've been through,

11:32.911 --> 11:34.745
everything she's done...

11:37.666 --> 11:40.000
she's a fucking
mystery to me.

11:42.471 --> 11:44.111
So now I realize
two things are possible--

11:44.173 --> 11:46.506
One, something
has changed within her,

11:46.592 --> 11:49.392
something so significant that she's
turned into someone I barely recognize,

11:49.478 --> 11:51.061
or, two...

11:52.848 --> 11:55.232
it was a fantasy that
I ever knew her at all.

11:57.019 --> 11:58.268
And the most disturbing
thing about it is,

11:58.353 --> 12:00.103
because it's Anne...

12:02.691 --> 12:06.026
I will likely
never know which it is.

12:07.362 --> 12:09.029
Am I angry
that she's gone?

12:11.533 --> 12:14.367
Maybe with everything that lies ahead
of us, perhaps it's for the best.

12:50.739 --> 12:52.322
I'm here to see
the lady of the house.

12:52.407 --> 12:53.790
She's occupied.

12:53.876 --> 12:55.375
Tell her
it's news from home.

12:55.410 --> 12:57.244
Use those words,
please.

13:09.591 --> 13:11.558
<i>Good morning, dear.</i>

13:13.395 --> 13:15.812
What do you have for me?

13:15.898 --> 13:18.064
The quartermaster,
Featherstone,

13:18.100 --> 13:20.517
met with Max and Rackham
behind closed doors again.

13:20.602 --> 13:22.152
Entered in a huff,
left in a huff.

13:22.237 --> 13:24.321
Could you make out
their words?

13:24.406 --> 13:28.408
No, and I fear if I pressed any
closer, they'd have found me out.

13:28.443 --> 13:30.944
Ma'am, you know I am
eternally in your debt

13:30.996 --> 13:32.779
for how you treated me
when you oversaw the inn,

13:32.865 --> 13:36.116
but please don't ask me to
delve into this any further.

13:37.786 --> 13:41.922
It's all for a good cause,
rest assured.

13:41.957 --> 13:44.291
You haven't even told me what
this is all in service of.

13:44.376 --> 13:47.294
Who the information's
being purchased for.

14:02.394 --> 14:04.311
When last we spoke, you
said you were still undecided

14:04.396 --> 14:06.813
as to who would assume control
ostensibly of the operation.

14:06.865 --> 14:09.199
I was just wondering
if you'd reached a decision.

14:10.569 --> 14:12.736
Not yet.
Shortly.

14:12.821 --> 14:15.655
- Is that all?
- Yes, ma'am.

14:17.993 --> 14:20.577
No news from the fort?

14:20.662 --> 14:22.996
The doors are still shut.
No word from inside.

14:23.048 --> 14:24.664
Either they're plotting
some sort of reprisal

14:24.750 --> 14:27.417
against us over the
disappearance of Miss Ashe or--

14:27.502 --> 14:29.669
Or they're still
choosing a new captain.

14:31.006 --> 14:32.756
Yes, ma'am.

14:42.067 --> 14:43.850
Ma'am, the lady is here.

14:43.936 --> 14:45.685
She's here right now?

14:45.771 --> 14:48.355
Yes, ma'am.
Said it was urgent.

14:48.407 --> 14:50.607
All right.

14:55.697 --> 14:57.497
Were we scheduled
to see each other today?

14:57.532 --> 15:00.367
No, ma'am.

15:00.419 --> 15:03.787
But I have news I think you'll
want to hear without delay.

15:03.872 --> 15:06.373
<i>May I sit?</i>

15:11.346 --> 15:14.547
When you engaged me to monitor
the goings on across the way,

15:14.633 --> 15:18.218
for a generous stipend,
I might add,

15:18.270 --> 15:22.389
I must confess, I thought you'd
overestimated our young friend Max,

15:22.441 --> 15:26.026
<i>worrying that she was clever enough
to create any real trouble--</i>

15:26.061 --> 15:27.727
I'm sorry, is there a point
you are trying to make?

15:27.813 --> 15:30.397
I was wrong.

15:30.449 --> 15:33.566
There is something
afoot at the inn.

15:33.652 --> 15:35.735
I believe
I know what it is.

15:35.821 --> 15:38.071
<i>And I believe you'll
want to know it, too.</i>

15:44.246 --> 15:46.663
Next item!

15:49.001 --> 15:53.086
I know my role here is to
recount information to you.

15:53.138 --> 15:55.805
But with what lies ahead,

15:55.891 --> 15:59.559
I'm hoping you'll indulge me
in a personal account.

15:59.594 --> 16:03.847
About five years ago,
I served on a merchant vessel

16:03.932 --> 16:06.766
<i>running slaves in and out
of Charles Town.</i>

16:06.852 --> 16:11.571
I remember the first time
I saw those walls,

16:11.606 --> 16:14.357
those patrol ships,

16:14.443 --> 16:17.494
and those fucking guns.

16:17.579 --> 16:19.279
The first mate leans in

16:19.331 --> 16:22.449
as he sees that look
on my face.

16:22.501 --> 16:26.252
He says,
"That, son,

16:26.288 --> 16:30.423
is a town resolved
never to be fucked with."

16:31.676 --> 16:33.460
<i>And as we're
unloading our cargo,</i>

16:33.545 --> 16:37.630
we watch a gathering
in the square-- a gallows.

16:37.682 --> 16:40.934
<i>And we watch
as they haul up a man</i>

16:40.969 --> 16:43.636
named Solomon Little.

16:45.190 --> 16:46.973
And they announced
to the crowd that this man...

16:47.025 --> 16:49.309
When Captain Flint first
arrived on this island,

16:49.394 --> 16:52.445
he gained influence faster
than any man I'd seen before.

16:52.481 --> 16:54.447
Or since.

16:54.483 --> 16:56.783
I heard men say it was
because of the violence.

16:56.818 --> 16:59.569
I heard them say
it was his charm.

16:59.654 --> 17:01.404
But it was clear
to me the reason why

17:01.490 --> 17:03.656
he was so good at bending
men towards his will

17:03.708 --> 17:06.159
was he knew
the power of a story

17:06.211 --> 17:09.045
<i>and how to harness it
to his own ends.</i>

17:09.131 --> 17:11.464
That man there,
I would argue,

17:11.500 --> 17:13.500
may very well
be his equal.

17:13.585 --> 17:17.220
...as they put the rope
around his neck.

17:17.305 --> 17:19.422
And I listened
to that excited talk...

17:19.508 --> 17:21.340
You know it
isn't even his.

17:21.393 --> 17:23.510
What do you mean?

17:23.561 --> 17:26.479
The pirate story
is Bernard's.

17:26.515 --> 17:28.013
I've heard him
tell it before.

17:28.099 --> 17:30.517
This man was no more
than an animal...

17:30.602 --> 17:32.852
Jeffries, I think.
Can't remember.

17:34.689 --> 17:37.657
Can't trust a fucking
thing out of his mouth.

17:37.692 --> 17:41.027
Yeah, the story's his,
the story isn't his.

17:41.079 --> 17:44.080
But the power
of the telling...

17:44.166 --> 17:46.583
that is clearly his.

17:48.036 --> 17:50.920
At the moment, he's using
it to help the captain.

17:51.006 --> 17:52.505
But God help us
if he ever realizes

17:52.541 --> 17:54.874
what else he could
use it to accomplish.

17:54.960 --> 17:57.844
<i>And as he swung,</i>

17:57.879 --> 17:59.963
I watched the crowd
jeer at him.

18:01.349 --> 18:04.884
I watched them laugh
and celebrate.

18:04.936 --> 18:07.470
Women, children,
all of them.

18:07.556 --> 18:11.107
I tell you, friends,

18:11.193 --> 18:14.027
what lies ahead
isn't just the governor

18:14.062 --> 18:17.230
nor his lieutenants
or his soldiers or their guns.

18:17.282 --> 18:20.483
The people
of Charles Town

18:20.569 --> 18:24.237
are eager
to see you and me dead.

18:26.041 --> 18:29.659
If Captain Flint is
to come through this alive,

18:29.744 --> 18:32.579
we will need to be focused
and at our best.

18:42.224 --> 18:44.057
What the hell was that?

18:45.760 --> 18:47.310
What?

18:47.395 --> 18:49.729
When you two returned and the
three of us stood on that beach,

18:49.764 --> 18:51.564
what did I say to you?

18:53.068 --> 18:55.768
You said if we told Flint
the gold was gone,

18:55.854 --> 18:57.604
you'd get another crew
to go back and get it

18:57.656 --> 19:00.273
and we could have
a bigger share.

19:04.329 --> 19:05.828
Well, there we go.

19:05.914 --> 19:08.031
There's the problem.

19:08.116 --> 19:11.117
It seems you only heard half
of what I said that night.

19:11.169 --> 19:14.204
I also said
that if anyone,

19:14.289 --> 19:18.124
anyone even remotely suspected
something was off about our story,

19:18.210 --> 19:20.343
if they even detected
the faintest whiff of it,

19:20.428 --> 19:22.629
we would all
be dead men.

19:22.714 --> 19:25.215
That sounds familiar,
does it not?

19:25.300 --> 19:27.217
<i> All right.</i>

19:28.520 --> 19:30.470
- I understand.
- Do you?

19:30.522 --> 19:34.307
The men on this ship
face grave danger ahead.

19:34.359 --> 19:38.478
So when you sit behind them
grinning like a fucking child,

19:38.530 --> 19:41.481
you can see how
that presents a problem.

19:41.533 --> 19:43.483
How it might elicit
the very questions

19:43.535 --> 19:46.703
we came on this fucking trip to
avoid in the fucking first place.

19:46.788 --> 19:48.955
I said I understand.

19:48.990 --> 19:50.373
No one's asking questions.

19:50.458 --> 19:53.826
No one knows shit, so
leave me alone about it.

20:02.087 --> 20:04.420
That man has the potential
to be a very real problem

20:04.506 --> 20:05.805
for the two of us.

20:09.894 --> 20:13.429
The other day, I received
word from one of Max's girls

20:13.515 --> 20:16.849
that Charlotte
had left the island,

20:16.901 --> 20:18.851
ran off with a man
in the middle of the night.

20:18.903 --> 20:21.854
So in love, they say,
with a man from Flint's crew,

20:21.906 --> 20:23.573
a man named Logan,

20:23.658 --> 20:27.610
that they started a life
together in Providence.

20:34.703 --> 20:35.918
What is that?

20:36.004 --> 20:38.087
Charlotte's savings.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.792
Charlotte didn't trust
the other girls,

20:42.877 --> 20:45.128
didn't trust the turns.

20:45.213 --> 20:48.548
So she entrusted it
to me to watch it for her.

20:48.600 --> 20:51.100
She and this man
leave the island

20:51.186 --> 20:54.220
on the eve of securing
an unprecedented prize

20:54.306 --> 20:58.191
with no warning,
no witnesses, and no money.

20:58.226 --> 21:00.310
I'm sorry,
I'm not following.

21:00.395 --> 21:02.729
Why did you engage
my services, ma'am?

21:02.781 --> 21:05.732
To monitor a brothel madam

21:05.784 --> 21:07.867
intent on stealing
information

21:07.902 --> 21:09.736
to use for her benefit.

21:09.788 --> 21:12.455
A member of Flint's crew,

21:12.540 --> 21:15.408
with knowledge of the
whereabouts of the Urca gold,

21:15.493 --> 21:17.410
walks into her inn.

21:17.462 --> 21:20.913
He promptly disappears under
suspicious circumstances,

21:20.965 --> 21:23.082
and less than a day later,

21:23.134 --> 21:27.053
news arrives that the Urca
gold is no longer to be won,

21:27.088 --> 21:30.306
but is safely
on its way back to Spain.

21:34.763 --> 21:36.813
You're asking
me to believe

21:36.898 --> 21:38.681
that Max somehow
got the information

21:38.767 --> 21:40.600
about the Urca
out of this man's head,

21:40.685 --> 21:43.903
murdered him and then
one of her own girls,

21:43.938 --> 21:47.240
and then somehow managed to convince
Captain Flint and the rest of his crew

21:47.275 --> 21:50.326
that the Urca gold
had disappeared?

21:50.412 --> 21:52.028
How the fuck
would she do that?

21:52.113 --> 21:54.364
I don't know.

21:55.950 --> 21:59.452
But this morning,
Captain Rackham's ship

21:59.504 --> 22:03.122
emptied the entire contents
of its hold onto the island,

22:03.174 --> 22:05.758
<i>started loading up
with fresh water,</i>

22:05.794 --> 22:07.877
<i>preparing to set sail.</i>

22:07.962 --> 22:09.796
<i>Wherever he's going,</i>

22:09.848 --> 22:12.765
<i>he anticipates bringing
something very large back.</i>

22:12.801 --> 22:16.636
I believe Max
learned about the prize.

22:16.688 --> 22:18.805
I believe somehow
she managed

22:18.857 --> 22:20.940
to convince the island
it had disappeared.

22:20.975 --> 22:24.360
<i>I believe that right now
she and her partners</i>

22:24.446 --> 22:26.646
<i>are preparing
to retrieve it</i>

22:26.731 --> 22:28.564
<i>and bring it back
to this place.</i>

22:28.650 --> 22:32.952
<i>Were that to happen, the thieves
and their like would flourish here</i>

22:32.987 --> 22:36.289
<i>and your plans for this place
would be doomed to failure.</i>

22:41.079 --> 22:44.714
I want the Nassau
you are trying to build.

22:44.799 --> 22:48.000
But if that Nassau
is ever to be,

22:48.052 --> 22:50.553
you have to stop her.

23:03.101 --> 23:04.817
Captain?

23:08.356 --> 23:10.857
Winds are more favorable
than we anticipated.

23:10.909 --> 23:13.359
De Groot wants to tack earlier
through the wind than you suggested.

23:13.411 --> 23:16.028
Might take some maneuvering. He'd
prefer not to do it in the dark,

23:16.114 --> 23:17.354
but he thinks
the men are, um...

23:18.867 --> 23:21.667
up to it.

23:21.703 --> 23:25.788
So, as long as you're in agreement,
he'll make preparations.

23:25.874 --> 23:27.206
Tell him
I'm in agreement.

23:27.292 --> 23:29.292
The sooner we get her
home, the better.

23:41.189 --> 23:45.024
His name is Billy,
in case you were wondering.

23:45.059 --> 23:47.310
I beg your pardon.

23:47.395 --> 23:49.445
He just...

23:49.531 --> 23:51.564
seems so
out of place here.

23:51.649 --> 23:54.150
Like someone I might have
known back home in London.

23:54.235 --> 23:55.785
He may easily have been.

23:56.955 --> 24:00.072
His parents were
Levelers in Kensington.

24:00.158 --> 24:03.743
Spoke out against
impressment, kidnappings.

24:03.795 --> 24:06.913
Printed pamphlets
from their home.

24:06.965 --> 24:09.298
Insisted that Billy
was lettered

24:09.384 --> 24:12.218
so that he could understand
the cause and contribute.

24:14.088 --> 24:17.757
That winter, when the press
gangs came through town,

24:17.842 --> 24:21.761
they found Billy distributing
those pamphlets in the street.

24:21.846 --> 24:25.398
I suppose they found
it funny, snatching him

24:25.433 --> 24:28.100
and leaving only the pamphlets
for his parents to find.

24:30.488 --> 24:32.071
Did he ever
see them again,

24:32.106 --> 24:34.023
his mother and father?

24:34.108 --> 24:37.326
When we found Billy,
we freed him,

24:37.412 --> 24:39.912
and when given the opportunity
to confront the man

24:39.948 --> 24:42.999
that had taken him
from his family,

24:43.084 --> 24:45.284
held him in bondage
for three years

24:45.336 --> 24:48.337
without wages
or reprieve,

24:48.423 --> 24:50.623
he slew that man.

24:52.460 --> 24:55.795
<i>After that, he said he couldn't
face his father again.</i>

24:55.847 --> 24:59.465
Didn't think he'd be able to
accept a murderer for a son.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.139
Coming through
the wind again, gents.

25:07.191 --> 25:08.357
This one's
gonna be tight.

25:08.443 --> 25:09.976
Watch yourselves, eh?

25:10.061 --> 25:12.812
Tyson, foremast,
Howard, mizzen,

25:12.864 --> 25:15.531
Irving, main.

25:39.507 --> 25:43.309
What lies ahead, I'm afraid I
might be wholly unprepared for.

25:43.344 --> 25:46.562
I always thought this journey
would end in battle.

25:46.648 --> 25:50.516
A fight to preserve
the things we held dear.

25:51.819 --> 25:55.187
I understood that.
I was ready for that.

25:55.239 --> 25:57.356
Now, as it turns out,

25:57.442 --> 25:59.775
something else lies
at the end of this road.

26:01.079 --> 26:02.862
Judgment.

26:02.914 --> 26:06.032
Not of Nassau,
but of me

26:06.117 --> 26:08.000
and the man
that I've become.

26:08.036 --> 26:10.286
And this entire endeavor

26:10.371 --> 26:12.955
hangs in the balance
of that judgment.

26:13.041 --> 26:16.008
You can defend that man.

26:16.044 --> 26:18.878
There are good arguments
in defense of him.

26:18.930 --> 26:22.632
For some of his deeds,
perhaps for most of them.

26:22.717 --> 26:25.267
But there are some things
that Captain Flint has done

26:25.353 --> 26:27.553
that cannot be defended.

26:27.605 --> 26:30.272
<i>I will make my argument</i>

26:30.358 --> 26:33.275
<i>having no sense
of my footing with him.</i>

26:33.361 --> 26:36.362
<i>No sense of the things
he knows about me,</i>

26:36.397 --> 26:39.532
<i>the lower things.
The darker things.</i>

26:42.070 --> 26:44.236
<i>And the moment he reveals
that he knows these things</i>

26:44.288 --> 26:47.073
<i>may be the moment that this
all comes crashing down.</i>

26:47.125 --> 26:51.327
He is going
to render judgment.

26:51.412 --> 26:55.748
And it all depends on what he
sees standing before him--

26:55.800 --> 26:59.552
Me or my name.

27:12.016 --> 27:13.566
I just want you to know,

27:13.601 --> 27:15.317
I appreciate the
opportunity you gave us.

27:16.904 --> 27:20.406
It's all right.
I'm not stupid.

27:20.441 --> 27:22.742
Neither is he, honestly.

27:22.777 --> 27:24.860
<i>He's torn up inside.</i>

27:24.946 --> 27:28.114
Betraying the other men,
it's making him act foolish.

27:28.199 --> 27:31.200
Like you've seen.

27:31.285 --> 27:33.586
That may very well be.

27:33.621 --> 27:35.705
But he won't matter for much if
he gets the three of us killed.

27:35.790 --> 27:37.039
I know.

27:38.626 --> 27:41.010
I know.

27:41.095 --> 27:44.130
Sometimes he's just
so fucking stubborn.

27:44.182 --> 27:47.933
Always been like that, long
as we've sailed together.

27:47.969 --> 27:51.804
It's a goddamn
shame, truly.

27:51.856 --> 27:53.889
I wish it
were otherwise.

27:53.975 --> 27:56.726
Well, if you can think of something to
say to him to get him to fall in line,

27:56.811 --> 27:58.861
now would be a good time.

27:58.946 --> 28:02.148
Say to him?

28:02.233 --> 28:04.366
Ain't we past that now?

28:05.953 --> 28:07.486
Past it?

28:07.538 --> 28:08.821
What you asked me to do,

28:08.873 --> 28:10.990
wasn't the point to solve
the problem for good?

28:14.912 --> 28:16.829
What the hell
are you talking about?

28:16.881 --> 28:19.498
Nicholas was scheduled
for duty on the mainmast.

28:19.584 --> 28:22.024
It seemed the perfect chance to
make it look like an accident.

28:36.234 --> 28:37.850
- Clear out!
- Who is it?

28:37.902 --> 28:40.686
Who is it?

28:48.196 --> 28:50.696
What about this?
Ahem.

28:50.782 --> 28:54.366
Upon our return, we anchor the
ship off the southern coast.

28:54.418 --> 28:57.203
A team of men excavate
a trench inland.

29:00.041 --> 29:02.424
We leave the bulk of
the coin in the trench,

29:02.510 --> 29:04.210
keep the location secret,

29:04.262 --> 29:07.379
and rotate men in watches
to keep it under guard?

29:08.966 --> 29:11.517
Your answer as where to secure
five million pieces of eight

29:11.552 --> 29:13.135
is to dig a hole?

29:16.307 --> 29:18.607
All right,
how about this?

29:18.693 --> 29:21.727
It is astonishing
how much damage

29:21.813 --> 29:24.780
a woman can do once you
let her in the door.

29:26.150 --> 29:27.650
Is he talking about you?

29:27.735 --> 29:28.901
He's talking
about Miss Bonny.

29:28.953 --> 29:30.286
I'm talking about
Miss Guthrie.

29:30.371 --> 29:32.071
We all know what happened
up at that fort.

29:32.123 --> 29:33.789
He lets her in,
she walks off

29:33.875 --> 29:36.075
with a prize
worth a fortune,

29:36.127 --> 29:37.710
leaving him to swing
in the wind for it.

29:37.745 --> 29:41.330
Right now Charles is either
fighting to preserve his captaincy

29:41.415 --> 29:43.575
and looking for any good
argument to win them a fortune,

29:43.584 --> 29:47.002
and quickly, or he's dead
and some new captain

29:47.088 --> 29:48.888
is wrestling with
the same question.

29:48.923 --> 29:50.422
What are you saying?

29:50.474 --> 29:53.642
Where does one store
a fortune in gold coins?

29:53.728 --> 29:55.761
In a goddamn fort.

29:55.813 --> 29:59.648
What, you're just gonna walk
up there, knock on the door,

29:59.734 --> 30:02.401
and ask whoever answers
if they'll let us use

30:02.436 --> 30:04.904
your half-demolished fort
as a treasury?

30:08.109 --> 30:10.860
Please go with him
so he doesn't get killed.

30:10.945 --> 30:13.445
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

30:20.004 --> 30:21.503
Ma'am.

30:26.294 --> 30:29.795
It's been a day since Mrs. Mapleton
told us of the plot next door.

30:29.847 --> 30:31.847
For the past day,
I have watched the crew

30:31.933 --> 30:34.099
of the Colonial Dawn
loading supplies.

30:34.135 --> 30:38.103
They are now nearly through and likely
less than a day away from setting sail.

30:38.139 --> 30:41.307
I've wanted to give you the
time you needed to deliberate,

30:41.359 --> 30:43.642
but now I'm concerned
you may not appreciate

30:43.728 --> 30:45.311
how precarious
things will be here

30:45.396 --> 30:47.563
should that gold
reach our shores.

30:49.734 --> 30:52.618
Ma'am, pirates flush with Spanish
gold will be encouraged.

30:52.653 --> 30:54.119
They will be empowered.

30:54.155 --> 30:56.038
But what they will never be,
under any circumstances,

30:56.123 --> 30:59.792
<i>is partners in a plan
to reconcile with England.</i>

30:59.827 --> 31:02.294
<i>From where I sit,
I think it is clear</i>

31:02.330 --> 31:03.913
that we must act
to prevent--

31:03.998 --> 31:05.631
We?

31:07.802 --> 31:10.669
I'm fairly certain that you aren't
suggesting that <i> we</i> do anything.

31:10.755 --> 31:12.972
The only way
to truly ensure

31:13.007 --> 31:14.590
that the Urca gold
doesn't return here

31:14.675 --> 31:17.009
is to eliminate everyone
with the knowledge

31:17.094 --> 31:19.011
of where it is
and how to retrieve it.

31:21.015 --> 31:24.316
You are suggesting that I have
all of these people killed.

31:24.352 --> 31:26.268
Captain Rackham,
his leadership,

31:26.354 --> 31:28.520
any of his men who've
been made aware of it.

31:31.192 --> 31:33.108
Max.

31:34.612 --> 31:36.528
With all due
respect, ma'am,

31:36.614 --> 31:39.198
it's not as if
you haven't done it before.

31:42.119 --> 31:45.704
I have done what I have done
to arrive at this point.

31:45.756 --> 31:47.873
I have done what I've done
and I will live with it.

31:47.925 --> 31:50.292
But do not for a moment
believe that that defines me.

31:50.378 --> 31:53.045
<i>I will not be that person.</i>

32:19.740 --> 32:22.157
<i>God rest his soul.</i>

32:48.436 --> 32:49.852
Why?

32:49.937 --> 32:51.854
I thought you'd made it
clear what I was to do.

32:51.939 --> 32:53.906
How the fuck could
you have thought that?

32:53.941 --> 32:55.824
You said he could sink us.

32:55.910 --> 32:57.443
Then you gave me a look.

32:59.914 --> 33:02.531
Let me see
if I have this.

33:02.616 --> 33:05.084
Flint gives an order, but to
get you men to follow it,

33:05.119 --> 33:08.319
<i>I need to come down here, put on a show,
and convince you it's in your interests.</i>

33:09.957 --> 33:13.258
But I give you a look

33:13.294 --> 33:15.294
and you're willing to
murder a man over it?

33:15.346 --> 33:19.631
I listen to Flint because you
tell me it's in my interests.

33:19.717 --> 33:23.435
I listen to you because I know you
give a shit about my interests

33:23.471 --> 33:25.771
and I ain't the only one
thinks that way.

33:34.231 --> 33:37.149
<i>...be turned into corruption,</i>

33:37.201 --> 33:40.369
<i>looking for the
resurrection of the body</i>

33:40.454 --> 33:43.956
<i>,</i>

33:43.991 --> 33:46.408
<i>and the life
of the world to come</i>

33:46.494 --> 33:48.544
<i>through our Lord
Jesus Christ.</i>

33:48.629 --> 33:50.412
<i>Amen.</i>

33:50.498 --> 33:52.331
Amen.

33:56.837 --> 34:00.255
<i>We therefore commit
his body to the deep.</i>

34:00.341 --> 34:02.724
Nicholas Irving.

34:09.350 --> 34:10.681
<i>From across an ocean,</i>

34:10.734 --> 34:13.402
<i>it is hard to know
what the New World is.</i>

34:16.940 --> 34:19.992
<i>All I knew
were the stories I was told</i>

34:20.027 --> 34:23.911
<i>of monsters and valiant men
sworn to slay them.</i>

34:25.699 --> 34:28.167
<i>But now that I've nearly
traversed the ocean</i>

34:28.202 --> 34:30.869
<i>that separates
New World from old,</i>

34:30.955 --> 34:34.339
<i>I fear that the stories
I've heard</i>

34:34.375 --> 34:38.210
<i>may have clouded the truth
more than clarified it.</i>

34:39.597 --> 34:43.181
<i>It would seem
these monsters are men--</i>

34:43.217 --> 34:46.385
<i>Sons, brothers,</i>

34:46.437 --> 34:48.387
<i>fathers.</i>

34:51.725 --> 34:53.725
<i>And it would
seem these men</i>

34:53.777 --> 34:56.895
<i>fear their own monsters--</i>

34:58.232 --> 35:00.782
<i>An empire...</i>

35:00.868 --> 35:03.035
<i>a navy...</i>

35:03.070 --> 35:04.570
<i>a king.</i>

35:06.323 --> 35:08.240
<i>My father.</i>

35:14.548 --> 35:17.382
<i>So much
I've left behind me--</i>

35:17.418 --> 35:19.835
<i>London, my youth,</i>

35:19.920 --> 35:23.055
<i>and comfortable stories.</i>

35:23.090 --> 35:25.507
<i>So much lies ahead
in Charles Town--</i>

35:25.593 --> 35:29.261
<i>A future
and harder truths.</i>

35:30.598 --> 35:34.900
<i>I feel I must
face it honestly, bravely.</i>

35:34.935 --> 35:39.521
<i>I must face it
as my father's daughter,</i>

35:39.607 --> 35:42.941
<i>and I believe that
in order to do that,</i>

35:42.993 --> 35:46.945
<i>I have to tell these people
that which I've kept from them.</i>

35:47.031 --> 35:49.998
<i>I have to tell them
what I know.</i>

35:52.670 --> 35:56.038
I've told you my father
is a reasonable man,

35:56.123 --> 35:59.374
and that is true
about most things.

35:59.460 --> 36:03.595
At one point,
he was even reasonable

36:03.631 --> 36:06.598
about the issue
of quelling piracy.

36:06.634 --> 36:09.551
Until I received
a letter from him

36:09.637 --> 36:11.520
years ago

36:11.605 --> 36:14.523
in which he recounted to me
the story of a ship...

36:15.809 --> 36:18.310
headed for Charles Town

36:18.362 --> 36:21.063
attacked by pirates.

36:21.148 --> 36:25.150
<i>The ship which was attacked
was named the Maria Aleyne.</i>

36:30.491 --> 36:32.991
<i>The ship was set upon
by Captain Flint and his men.</i>

36:35.713 --> 36:38.497
And in the midst
of the bloody assault,

36:38.549 --> 36:41.550
there was one
particular victim,

36:41.635 --> 36:43.835
a very important man

36:43.921 --> 36:45.504
traveling under
an assumed name.

36:47.141 --> 36:50.175
His name
was Alfred Hamilton.

36:55.599 --> 36:58.150
<i>Given the lengths
to which this man had gone</i>

36:58.185 --> 37:00.519
to protect himself,

37:00.571 --> 37:04.156
the fact that he fell under
Captain Flint's sword...

37:05.993 --> 37:08.160
suggested
he'd been hunted,

37:08.195 --> 37:11.747
<i>pursued, and then
executed in cold blood</i>

37:11.832 --> 37:14.032
<i>and with great
malice aforethought.</i>

37:20.040 --> 37:22.341
<i>The motive unclear,</i>

37:22.376 --> 37:26.845
<i>but the intent apparently
dark and awful,</i>

37:26.880 --> 37:29.715
<i>monstrous.</i>

37:29.800 --> 37:33.852
<i>He said the act was completely
incompatible with civilized society.</i>

37:33.887 --> 37:36.438
<i>That he would dedicate
his life to eradicating it.</i>

37:39.026 --> 37:41.443
And that there would be law
in the Americas...

37:43.447 --> 37:46.281
the day Captain Flint
swung over Charles Town.

37:48.152 --> 37:51.737
I appreciate
what you've done for me.

37:51.822 --> 37:54.072
I respect what you hope
to accomplish,

37:54.158 --> 37:56.158
so I ask you,

37:56.243 --> 37:58.960
when you return me
to Charles Town,

37:59.046 --> 38:02.331
turn around
and sail away.

38:23.737 --> 38:26.271
Do you think those patrol
ships have clearance to fire?

38:26.357 --> 38:29.741
Not while we're out
of range of that fort.

38:29.777 --> 38:32.944
As long as we don't come any
further, they know we're no threat.

38:36.033 --> 38:38.617
I don't want to see a single
one of our gun ports open.

38:38.669 --> 38:42.120
I don't want to see a single man
on deck with a weapon in his hand.

38:42.206 --> 38:43.922
This only works
if we can make it clear

38:43.957 --> 38:48.176
that we have absolutely no intention
of shooting at anyone today.

38:48.262 --> 38:50.128
What if they
start shooting at us?

38:50.180 --> 38:52.381
Duck.

38:55.135 --> 38:56.718
<i>Prepare to drop anchor!</i>

39:00.474 --> 39:01.807
I've made arrangements.

39:01.892 --> 39:03.252
You'll be safe here
until I return.

39:03.277 --> 39:05.117
What are you talking about?
I'm going with you.

39:05.145 --> 39:07.062
You heard what she said.
It's too dangerous.

39:07.147 --> 39:10.148
If I'm standing next to you, he's far more
likely to see you as the man you were.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.317
He's more likely
to see you as a woman

39:12.369 --> 39:14.903
abetting a known pirate
and hang you alongside me.

39:14.988 --> 39:17.239
- I see no reason for you to take that risk.
- Of course there is reason.

39:17.324 --> 39:19.364
- None that I am willing to take.
- It was my fault.

39:21.378 --> 39:24.830
I'm the one who learned Alfred
Hamilton was a passenger on that ship.

39:24.915 --> 39:28.166
I knew the moment I told you
what it would drive you to do.

39:28.218 --> 39:30.218
I knew the danger
it would put you in,

39:30.304 --> 39:31.837
knew the horrors
it would incite.

39:31.889 --> 39:35.424
I told myself to remain
silent and spare him,

39:35.509 --> 39:39.394
spare you those horrors,

39:39.480 --> 39:42.063
and yet I told you anyway.

39:42.149 --> 39:45.233
If you're going to face
judgment behind those walls,

39:45.319 --> 39:46.852
then so should I,

39:46.904 --> 39:49.938
for if anyone is responsible
for what happened that day,

39:50.023 --> 39:51.323
it's me.

39:51.358 --> 39:54.743
<i>Captain Vane!</i>

40:08.709 --> 40:11.209
Captain Vane!

40:16.099 --> 40:18.300
Are you Captain Vane?

40:18.385 --> 40:22.220
<i>We received your letter
and your demands.</i>

40:22.306 --> 40:25.140
We are prepared to pay
the sum you requested

40:25.225 --> 40:27.225
for Abigail Ashe.

40:27.277 --> 40:29.895
I am not Charles Vane.

40:29.980 --> 40:32.063
I have no demands.

40:32.149 --> 40:35.734
But I do have a request.

41:18.495 --> 41:20.529
Captain James Flint.

41:25.586 --> 41:27.118
You're Captain Flint?

41:29.122 --> 41:30.422
I am.

41:30.457 --> 41:33.458
And you wish an audience
with Lord Ashe?

41:34.761 --> 41:36.962
I do.

41:40.100 --> 41:42.133
This was a different place
before the governor arrived.

41:42.185 --> 41:44.719
Raiders routinely
hit our shipping.

41:44.805 --> 41:47.105
All up and down
the coast

41:47.140 --> 41:48.607
as far north
as Mt. Pleasant,

41:48.642 --> 41:50.976
as far south as
the Cumberland Sound.

41:51.028 --> 41:53.778
It took him a short while to
learn how to deal with it.

41:53.814 --> 41:57.032
<i>But once he committed to fighting
the problem, things changed.</i>

41:57.117 --> 42:00.118
<i>You see, he made these
people unafraid.</i>

42:00.153 --> 42:03.622
<i>Everyone realized, like just about
anything else in this life...</i>

42:05.075 --> 42:07.325
the moment
you stop fearing it,

42:07.377 --> 42:09.160
it loses all its power.

42:11.548 --> 42:13.381
No!

42:13.467 --> 42:15.000
<i>The governor is a friend!</i>

42:15.052 --> 42:16.835
<i>The governor gave
very specific instructions.</i>

42:16.887 --> 42:20.171
- No, don't!
- If we were able to get our hands on Captain Vane,

42:20.257 --> 42:21.673
he never leaves
this place again.

42:21.725 --> 42:24.009
Stop.

42:24.061 --> 42:27.178
<i> I don't see any reason those
instructions don't apply to you, too.</i>

42:27.230 --> 42:28.930
- <i> If anything--</i>
- Stop!

42:32.319 --> 42:33.685
They're telling the truth.

42:33.770 --> 42:35.320
He's an old friend
of my father's.

42:35.355 --> 42:37.489
<i>I remember him.
I know him.</i>

42:39.443 --> 42:42.577
And if you strike him again,
my father will know

42:42.663 --> 42:45.447
you did so after I made
this clear to you.

44:12.619 --> 44:14.953
Welcome to Charles Town.

44:21.461 --> 44:25.296
Charles Vane corralled 40 of the
hardest men in the New World,

44:25.348 --> 44:28.717
brought them in line, brought
them across an ocean to this fort

44:28.802 --> 44:31.352
and conquered it

44:31.438 --> 44:33.972
with no support
from the water,

44:34.024 --> 44:36.608
no siege engineering,
just the will to take it,

44:36.643 --> 44:38.643
and throughout
all that time,

44:38.729 --> 44:40.945
through danger
and peril and blood,

44:40.981 --> 44:43.198
the greatest
threat he faced,

44:43.283 --> 44:45.817
the one enemy who may ultimately
have been his undoing,

44:45.869 --> 44:49.654
was, you know, someone
I once heard him

44:49.706 --> 44:51.656
refer to as Lady Honeypot.

44:53.994 --> 44:57.162
Beware the women, Mr. Featherstone.
They bite.

44:57.214 --> 44:59.497
I'm in love
with a good woman, sir.

44:59.549 --> 45:00.832
I'm not concerned.

45:02.502 --> 45:03.885
Idelle?

45:06.006 --> 45:07.172
Yes.

45:13.897 --> 45:16.598
It stands to reason
that if those 40 men

45:16.683 --> 45:20.185
were mean enough to take this
fort under Vane's leadership,

45:20.237 --> 45:22.020
were they
to ever turn on him,

45:22.072 --> 45:24.239
it would be
an ugly sight.

45:24.324 --> 45:28.326
May I suggest that whatever is going
on in the bowels of this fort,

45:28.361 --> 45:30.862
perhaps it's best
left alone for now.

45:30.947 --> 45:33.364
Perhaps.

45:33.450 --> 45:36.010
- What are you doing?
- I'm wondering why it's so quiet in there.

45:36.036 --> 45:39.037
Because they're occupied
plotting some sort of awfulness.

45:39.089 --> 45:42.290
That is one possibility. The other
is that they're no longer in there.

45:42.375 --> 45:44.209
What are you talking about?
Their ship is still in the bay.

45:44.294 --> 45:46.761
It is, but I'm less intrigued
by what's in the bay

45:46.847 --> 45:48.596
than what's up there.

47:43.380 --> 47:46.130
This was found
pinned onto him.

47:52.806 --> 47:54.589
<i>I was once a slave.</i>

47:54.674 --> 47:57.675
<i>I know too well the pain of
the yoke on my shoulders</i>

47:57.727 --> 48:01.012
<i>and of the freedom
of having cast it off.</i>

48:01.064 --> 48:03.932
<i>So I'm resolved,
I will be no slave again.</i>

48:05.685 --> 48:09.938
<i>And as I am free, I hereby
claim the same for Nassau.</i>

48:10.023 --> 48:11.572
<i>She is free today,</i>

48:11.658 --> 48:15.526
<i>and so long as I draw breath,
she shall remain free.</i>

48:17.197 --> 48:18.997
<i>Richard Guthrie
was engaged in an effort</i>

48:19.032 --> 48:21.616
<i>to see her return
to the rule of a king,</i>

48:21.701 --> 48:23.701
<i>to see the yoke returned.</i>

48:23.787 --> 48:26.788
<i>He betrayed Nassau,
and thus,</i>

48:26.873 --> 48:29.290
<i>as always,
to traitors.</i>

48:29.376 --> 48:32.794
<i>As far as you and I,
I was warned about you,</i>

48:32.879 --> 48:35.380
<i>warned you would
betray me.</i>

48:35.432 --> 48:37.382
<i>I'd hoped
you and I shared a love</i>

48:37.467 --> 48:39.384
<i>to make such a thing
unthinkable.</i>

48:39.436 --> 48:42.103
<i>I'd hoped those warnings
were wrong.</i>

48:42.188 --> 48:44.439
<i>But I know you too well,</i>

48:44.524 --> 48:48.142
<i>so I prepared
in case they were right.</i>

48:52.032 --> 48:54.532
<i>You removed the girl
from my possession,</i>

48:54.567 --> 48:57.068
<i>but in turn,
the man-of-war</i>

48:57.120 --> 48:58.903
<i>moved on from the bay,</i>

48:58.989 --> 49:03.708
<i>moved on from a position
of heightened security.</i>

49:03.743 --> 49:05.960
<i>Moved on to a place
where its attention,</i>

49:06.046 --> 49:08.079
<i>Captain Flint's attention,</i>

49:08.131 --> 49:11.049
<i>will be so very occupied</i>

49:11.084 --> 49:13.418
<i>on the danger
that is Charles Town</i>

49:13.503 --> 49:15.503
<i>and in the state
of apprehension</i>

49:15.588 --> 49:19.257
<i>in which the last thing
any of them will be watching</i>

49:19.842 --> 49:21.559
<i>is the water.</i>

49:23.646 --> 49:26.597
<i>I made clear
the price for the girl.</i>

49:26.649 --> 49:29.434
<i>You should have known me
well enough to know,</i>

49:29.519 --> 49:32.487
<i>one way or another,
I was going to claim it.</i>

49:33.940 --> 49:37.859
<i>And once I do,
I'll be returning to Nassau</i>

49:37.944 --> 49:40.695
<i>to settle the rest
of my accounts.</i>
