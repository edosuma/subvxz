Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:03.537 --> 00:06.974
You know, it's important to have
the support of the community

00:07.007 --> 00:08.809
when you first move
to this country.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.578
Yes. I am so thankful for it.

00:10.611 --> 00:13.081
Then you should be very careful.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.682
Regarding?

00:14.715 --> 00:17.851
I know you are...

00:17.885 --> 00:19.553
gay.

00:20.888 --> 00:23.124
Don't worry.
I will not tell anyone.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.393
I would appreciate that.
Mm-hmm.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.196
You heard about Morenike?
I did.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.931
She just did not seem
like that kind of girl.

00:30.964 --> 00:34.034
Well, you really can't tell
that kind of thing by looking.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.104
Although my mom thinks she can.

00:37.071 --> 00:40.141
It just hurts to be rejected
over something I cannot control.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.009
I think that's better.
It's not you.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.377
If she's gay, she's gay.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.546
She's gay?

00:46.714 --> 00:48.182
We just need
to warn Morenike

00:48.216 --> 00:49.717
that her secret
may be getting out.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.685
Mm-hmm. Because of Bob.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.087
Do we have to mention
the Bob part?

00:53.121 --> 00:55.489
Did you have to
mention the gay part?

00:55.523 --> 00:57.191
Fair.

00:57.225 --> 01:00.794
Be gone, servant of Satan!

01:00.828 --> 01:02.463
That can't be good.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.802
There they are.
Welcome to Dave's Coney,

01:08.836 --> 01:10.738
the crown jewel
of Detroit.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.073
I thought you were taking us to
the best restaurant in the city.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.743
It is.
This is a hot dog stand.

01:15.776 --> 01:16.777
I know.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.646
Across from a Jiffy Lube.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.281
Yeah.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.783
Dave's has been
here for 80 years.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.318
Dave smells like it.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.487
Be nice, Kemi.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.855
Thank you, Bob.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.523
I look forward to eating
80-year-old hot dogs.

01:29.557 --> 01:32.660
Trust me, it's a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.629
No, I've had food
poisoning before.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.498
I, too, once thought this
place was disgusting.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.733
Yeah, but then you gave
that greasy underdog a chance

01:39.767 --> 01:40.934
and fell in love.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.203
Sound familiar?

01:43.204 --> 01:44.172
Ugh.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.606
And I thought the hot dog

01:45.639 --> 01:47.608
would be the thing
to make me vomit.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.977
We are in your hands, Bob.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.146
Tell us what to dip
where and when.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.847
Smart move.
You're about to see chili used

01:53.881 --> 01:55.483
in ways you never
thought possible.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.951
Next customer, please.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.453
Uh...

01:59.487 --> 02:01.689
Morenike?
Oh.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.324
Hello, everyone.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.259
What are you doing here?

02:05.293 --> 02:06.260
Working.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.662
In this den of salmonella?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.031
I needed a job.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.433
I thought you were
in school full-time.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.535
I am.
Well, when do you sleep?

02:14.568 --> 02:16.404
Like the sign says,

02:16.437 --> 02:18.506
when the chili
runs out.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.110
So this is why you have been
nodding off in church.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.514
I assumed you were out burning
the midnight lesbian oil.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.251
You should be focusing
on your studies.
Does this job even pay well?

02:30.284 --> 02:32.720
You should still be
focusing on your studies.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.855
Guys, guys, come on.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.690
Maybe she's in it
for the free hot dogs.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.726
I am not, Bob.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.960
Okay.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.463
But I have no choice.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.866
Once my parents heard
about my situation,

02:45.899 --> 02:47.368
they disowned me.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.736
Oh, no.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.571
Is there anything
I can do?

02:50.604 --> 02:53.507
You have done enough already.

02:54.708 --> 02:58.178
Now do you wish you had
taken us to a steakhouse?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.076
Morenike's family
Photoshopped her

03:29.109 --> 03:30.578
out of every picture
on Facebook.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.580
Even her graduation photo.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.249
Her parents are just hugging
a certificate.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.751
That's cold.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.219
But very professional.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.888
I know who to call

03:40.921 --> 03:42.990
when I declare
one of my children dead to me.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.394
So, what's gonna happen
to Morenike?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.329
Without
her parents' money,

03:48.362 --> 03:50.898
she will have no choice
but to return home to Nigeria.

03:50.931 --> 03:54.468
Where they can control her life
and force her to marry a man.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.570
That's awful.
Mm-hmm.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.272
I know how she feels.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.674
When I refused to go back
to Nigeria with Tayo,

04:00.708 --> 04:02.676
everybody turned
their back on me.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.312
Everybody?

04:04.345 --> 04:07.180
Didn't your aunt and uncle
give you a place to live?

04:07.214 --> 04:11.452
I had to beat out 12 other
applicants for that room.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.186
Well, what about me?

04:13.220 --> 04:14.588
What about you?

04:14.622 --> 04:16.590
I supported you after Tayo left.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.926
You told me I was making
the biggest mistake of my life.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.262
I was supporting you
with honesty.

04:22.296 --> 04:26.367
You shouted, "Get off my couch
and go home to your husband."

04:26.400 --> 04:27.835
I was testing your conviction.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.637
You refused to be seen
with me in public.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.105
I was testing my conviction.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.112
Here. Go grab
lunch from Dave's.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.382
200 bucks' worth of chili dogs.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.617
Oh, no, are you
getting divorced again?

04:43.651 --> 04:46.954
It's not for me. Buy us lunch.
Put the rest in the tip jar.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.056
You should throw in
your watch.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.459
You ruined that
little gay girl's life.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.663
Starting to feel
like a drug deal.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.765
I assume.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.100
Morenike will think
you are doing this

05:00.133 --> 05:01.602
just to relieve your guilt.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.871
That's exactly why
I'm doing this.

05:04.938 --> 05:07.007
She's a Nigerian.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.076
Her pride will not allow her
to take your money.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.144
Oh, BS.
Everybody's got a number.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.946
300,000.
What?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.615
That's my price.
For what?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.984
You got the cash, you tell me.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.287
Years ago, after I lost
my professorship

05:20.320 --> 05:23.123
and then my home,
an old colleague offered

05:23.156 --> 05:25.125
to let me stay
at his house for free.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.560
Oh, that was nice.
It was.

05:26.594 --> 05:27.861
But I could not accept.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.397
My pride would not let me.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.865
That is why I admire you, cousin.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.233
Then you admire a fool.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.904
He had a Jacuzzi
and two eligible daughters.

05:36.937 --> 05:39.272
I was single,
and they were ready to mingle.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.274
And by "mingle," I mean...

05:41.308 --> 05:42.943
Yeah, we got it.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.580
So there's just no way
I can help her?

05:46.614 --> 05:48.148
I'm afraid not.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.584
Morenike will want to resolve
this problem on her own.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.319
I prefer the American way.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.221
You ruin somebody's life,

05:54.254 --> 05:56.256
the lawyers figure out
an amount to pay them off,

05:56.289 --> 05:58.025
and nobody ever talks
about it again.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.993
You mean like
that UPS guy you hit?

06:01.061 --> 06:03.230
Nobody ever talks
about it again.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.942
What are you doing?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.910
Just helping
our forgetful friend.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.249
"Kemi got me my first job here."

06:22.282 --> 06:23.283
Mm-hmm.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.685
"Kemi braided my hair

06:24.718 --> 06:26.319
and gave me my signature look."

06:26.353 --> 06:28.589
I did.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.323
"Kemi told me
to marry Bob.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.893
She's the reason I am
a happy trophy wife"?

06:35.028 --> 06:37.197
Look, If Abishola will not
give me any credit,

06:37.230 --> 06:39.967
then I will have to
take it by force.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.403
You know how
prideful she is.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.473
She just wants to believe

06:45.506 --> 06:47.541
she pulled herself up
by her bootstraps.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.843
I bought her the boots!

06:49.877 --> 06:51.445
Boots.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.715
You remember when Abishola
first came to this hospital?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.484
Of course.
She was pathetic.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.185
She was doing the
wrong paperwork,

06:58.218 --> 07:00.921
mixing up all the
old white patients.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.457
That's why you
give them nicknames:

07:03.491 --> 07:06.527
Toothless, Big Ears,
Spits When He Talks.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.929
The point is,

07:08.962 --> 07:11.565
we both saw a young girl
who looked like us,

07:11.599 --> 07:13.166
and we wanted her to succeed.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.704
We helped Abishola because
we were her support system,

07:16.737 --> 07:18.639
not because we
wanted credit.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.542
No, I always wanted credit.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.613
Give me this.

07:26.614 --> 07:27.815
What are you doing?

07:28.816 --> 07:30.718
Writing down all the times

07:30.751 --> 07:32.920
I saved your ass
from getting fired.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.990
"Naked with Andrew
in the deep freezer."

07:38.225 --> 07:40.694
"Fistfight with janitor."

07:42.129 --> 07:44.064
"Naked with janitor."

07:45.365 --> 07:47.467
I didn't know
you knew about that.

07:47.501 --> 07:51.739
Oh, I knew, and erased
the security camera footage.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.974
Wish I could erase it
from my memory.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.911
Well, unlike some people,

07:57.945 --> 08:02.149
I can show my gratitude,
so thank you, Gloria.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.416
You're welcome.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.452
You have looked out for me
like a much,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.955
much, much older sister.

08:08.922 --> 08:12.025
Please. You're just
one hot flash behind me.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.366
<i>E karo,</i> Auntie. <i>E karo,</i> Uncle.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.201
<i>E karo,</i> Morenike.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.336
It is a wonderful day, isn't it?

08:23.370 --> 08:25.839
As beautiful as a rainbow.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.275
You got new mugs.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.010
We did.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.845
The rainbow is a symbol

08:31.879 --> 08:33.413
of people who are like you.

08:33.446 --> 08:34.948
You do not have to whisper, Uncle.

08:34.982 --> 08:38.218
And in time, I will not.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.621
Thank you.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.890
It is a small
way to show

08:42.923 --> 08:44.291
we are proud of you.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.794
A small, private way
that we will hide

08:46.827 --> 08:49.429
if anyone from church
comes to visit.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.464
You are so good to me.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.401
Which is why I'm ashamed to say
I cannot make rent.

08:54.434 --> 08:57.070
Oh, do not worry.
We can give you a few days.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.972
But a few more days
will not help.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.642
I cannot afford to pay
for school and live here.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.343
What will you do?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.578
I have options.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.479
I found an experimental
drug trial

09:06.513 --> 09:08.315
that lets you sleep in the lab

09:08.348 --> 09:09.950
while they study the effects
on your brain.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.220
You will not be
anyone's guinea pig.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.855
You belong here with us.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.456
We will pause your rent.

09:16.489 --> 09:18.125
The last thing I want is to be

09:18.158 --> 09:19.993
a burden to those
who have stood by me.

09:20.027 --> 09:22.229
What if we call it a loan?

09:22.262 --> 09:23.563
That would help.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.565
And to make you feel
more comfortable,

09:25.599 --> 09:28.636
we can require you to sign
a binding contract.

09:28.669 --> 09:31.972
I would like that.
Of course. You are family.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.675
I do not know what
I would do without you.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.376
Do not worry.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.546
We offer a competitive,
adjustable-rate loan

09:39.579 --> 09:42.783
with no prepayment penalty.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.032
Abishola.
Yes?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.534
I have decided we need
to put our differences aside

10:01.568 --> 10:03.671
and focus on the greater good.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.974
What differences?

10:09.777 --> 10:11.879
I will also put the fact
that you are unaware

10:11.912 --> 10:14.481
that we had differences aside.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.618
Morenike needs our help.

10:18.652 --> 10:19.787
I agree.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.388
And who best to assist her

10:21.421 --> 10:23.556
than two flourishing
Nigerian women?

10:23.590 --> 10:25.625
"Flourishing." I like that.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.895
I thought it summed us up
quite well.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.964
We should get her a job
at the hospital.

10:30.998 --> 10:35.368
Yes. She cannot spend her nights
peddling salty wieners.

10:35.402 --> 10:38.338
I'll ask around and see
which floors need a nurse tech.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.774
Or I could just give her
a job in the cafeteria.

10:40.808 --> 10:44.411
How will moving from one greasy
place to another help her?

10:46.113 --> 10:49.416
My kitchen is not greasy.

10:49.449 --> 10:50.751
Kemi.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.587
My kitchen is not as greasy.

10:54.621 --> 10:57.624
We need to do what is best
for Morenike.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.926
And what does that mean?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.994
A job in a kitchen
does not set her up

11:01.028 --> 11:02.362
for success in her career.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.997
Oh, really?

11:04.031 --> 11:06.033
Because I seem to remember
a certain somebody

11:06.066 --> 11:07.901
who got their start
in my kitchen.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.703
And not on dish duty.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.739
I let you run the waffle maker.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.674
I only worked there
for a few months.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.310
It was a year, and it put
money in your pocket

11:17.344 --> 11:18.511
when you had nothing.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.013
Your nose is turned up so far,

11:20.047 --> 11:21.849
you have forgotten who got you
where you are.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.183
You?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.885
Yes!

11:24.918 --> 11:26.787
Let me refresh your memory, eh?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.223
I let you stay on my couch
when your husband left.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.993
I lent you money for textbooks.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.229
I told you when the hospital
was hiring nurses.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.031
And I got the job.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.600
I studied for years
to be qualified.

11:40.633 --> 11:41.869
I did all
the hard work,

11:41.902 --> 11:43.971
and you cannot
take credit for that.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.572
I do not want all of the credit.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.941
It would just be nice if you
would acknowledge a single one

11:47.975 --> 11:52.112
of the many, many things
I have done for you!

11:54.481 --> 11:56.216
This is nonsense.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.318
I gave birth to Dele myself.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.953
Yes, but I prayed for a boy!

12:10.430 --> 12:12.199
Oh, hey. Hello.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.867
What are you doing here?

12:13.901 --> 12:16.436
Uh, it's been a while
since I checked on Mom.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.638
I've been so busy
with the new job.

12:18.671 --> 12:20.507
Oh. I'm sure she understands.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.942
Yeah, she doesn't.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.684
Sorry, it's been a day.

12:31.718 --> 12:34.054
I've also had a day.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.322
Oh, do tell.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.523
It's nothing.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.158
I don't want to bother you
with it.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.894
Why not? I'm always boring you
with my problems.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.363
That is true.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.032
So come on,
have a drink

12:45.065 --> 12:47.434
and tell me
all about it.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.572
Did Kemi spend hours at
the immigration office

12:52.605 --> 12:54.374
after my visa expired?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.709
Did Kemi get a
nursing degree

12:56.743 --> 13:00.680
despite having to deal
with racist professors?

13:00.713 --> 13:02.749
Well, I don't know
Kemi's journey,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.751
but I'm gonna say no.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.853
Correct.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.622
Okay, you know
what I'm hearing?

13:09.656 --> 13:11.624
Hmm?
You need a reset.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.260
A reset?
Mm-hmm.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.295
I've got a place in Arizona.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.765
In the morning, you have therapy
and you empty your mind.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.935
And then in the afternoon,
you have a coffee enema

13:21.969 --> 13:24.471
and you empty your colon.

13:24.504 --> 13:27.307
I-I don't... I don't think
the answer is in my colon.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.477
Oh?
I will still be in debt
from nursing school.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.113
Mm.
And will add more
for medical school.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.615
Mine and Dele's.
Oh.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.317
I didn't realize that.

13:37.350 --> 13:41.088
And I still worry if I am
raising Dele the right way.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.290
Is he American enough?
Oh.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.359
Is he Nigerian enough?
Mm-hmm.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.728
Am I Nigerian enough?

13:48.761 --> 13:51.198
I want to say yes,

13:51.231 --> 13:53.733
but I don't think it's my place.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.469
Correct again!
Ah!

13:59.172 --> 14:00.573
Next customer.

14:00.607 --> 14:01.942
Bob.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.143
Wonderful to see you.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.477
I will get your back medicine.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.479
Actually, I'm here
for something else.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.381
Your mother's
anxiety medication?

14:08.415 --> 14:11.318
No.
Your sister's
anxiety medication?

14:11.351 --> 14:14.121
Boy, we are a family
of pill poppers.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.723
We are a country
of pill poppers.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.791
Go, Big Pharma.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.694
Right.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.964
Listen, I was hoping
you could help me out.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.532
Anything for you, Bob.

14:25.565 --> 14:27.434
I'm trying to get a job

14:27.467 --> 14:29.636
for a promising
young pharmacist.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.504
Oh, no, not that, Bob.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.042
Come on, Chuey.
You know Morenike's good.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.244
She's a hard worker,
super smart,

14:37.277 --> 14:39.379
top of her class
in pharmacy school.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.114
I have no doubt
that she is qualified.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.549
Then what's the problem?

14:42.582 --> 14:45.052
In my culture,
it is not acceptable

14:45.085 --> 14:48.521
to be associated
with someone like her.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.758
I get it.
When I was in high school,

14:51.791 --> 14:53.693
we had a gay guy
on our wrestling team.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.595
Made me uncomfortable
'cause we all had to change

14:55.628 --> 14:57.097
in the same locker room.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.131
What did you do?

14:58.165 --> 15:01.234
Well, I was a jerk
for a long time,

15:01.268 --> 15:03.670
and then one day,
I talked to him.

15:03.703 --> 15:06.039
Naked in the locker room?

15:06.073 --> 15:08.408
No. In school, fully clothed.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.743
But once I knew more than
that one thing about him,

15:10.777 --> 15:12.445
we became buddies.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.948
He came over to the house.
We hung out all the time.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.449
What did your mother say?

15:16.483 --> 15:18.118
Are you kidding?
She was crazy about him.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.586
Said she always wanted a gay son

15:19.619 --> 15:21.221
because they love
their mothers more.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.325
Yeah, I do not think my mother
would have the same reaction.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.994
I'm not talking to your mom.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.361
I'm talking to you.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.997
You're a good guy, Chuey.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.531
Always looking out for people.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.701
Because that is my duty
as a pharmacist.

15:34.734 --> 15:38.105
I took an oath to "consider
the welfare of humanity

15:38.138 --> 15:40.440
and relief of suffering."

15:40.473 --> 15:42.942
Sounds like you know
what you need to do, then.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.877
You're asking too much of me.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.279
I am just a man.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.548
You're not just a man, damn it.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.218
You are a pharmacist.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.434
Do you have to do that?

16:08.435 --> 16:10.437
My job? Yes.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.574
Why the hell were you getting
drunk on a Tuesday anyway?

16:14.607 --> 16:17.510
Because my sister-in-law
loves me.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.215
I heard that someone up here
has a headache.

16:22.249 --> 16:26.286
I would imagine this cart
is making it much worse.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.454
Kemi, please.

16:30.423 --> 16:34.061
Either apologize or get
the woman some WD-40.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.695
She should apologize to me.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.499
I can't take it.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.302
I'm going up to pre-op
and help shave people.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.738
Strange, you would think
my cart would be well-oiled

16:45.772 --> 16:47.640
from all the grease
in my kitchen.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.745
<i>E kaasan,</i> Aunties.
<i>E kaasan,</i> Morenike.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.747
I am so glad
you're both here.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.849
What is happening?

16:56.883 --> 16:59.086
I just wanted to thank you.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.488
Eh, you don't
have to do that.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.257
But I do. I'm overwhelmed
by your kindness.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.992
You should be.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.760
What kindness?

17:07.794 --> 17:10.663
You got me the job, didn't you?

17:10.697 --> 17:13.666
Of course we did.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.102
What job?

17:15.135 --> 17:17.304
What Abishola
is saying is

17:17.337 --> 17:19.372
we planted seeds
all over this city.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.708
You just have to remind us
which one's fruited.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.776
The CVS.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.146
The pay is better.
The hours are better.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.014
I get to work in
my profession.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.616
I start next week,

17:29.649 --> 17:31.118
and it is all
because of you.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.320
Oh, no, we don't do it
for the credit.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.524
I cannot wait to tell
Auntie and Uncle

17:37.557 --> 17:38.925
and thank them for
all their help.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.463
Why is she thanking them?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.332
They had nothing to do with it.

17:45.365 --> 17:49.369
Those two better not take credit
for what we apparently did.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.046
<i>E kaasan,</i> Auntie.
<i>E kaasan,</i> Uncle.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.614
Oh. Hello.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.316
That is
my wonderful niece.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.417
I'm sorry to interrupt.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.119
I did not realize
you had a guest.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.488
Oh, no,
James is not our guest.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.990
He is for you.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.126
I'm sorry, I do not understand.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.494
Neither do I.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.429
They said they had
a tax emergency.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.865
Uh, I can explain.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.868
That was a lie.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.604
James lives in 418.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.006
He has a rainbow welcome mat
outside his door.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.843
Which is helpful
for the other gays to find him.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.813
I should really go.
Oh, no.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.081
Did we offend you?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.284
Oh, we're sorry.
We don't know how to do this,

18:37.317 --> 18:39.686
but we are trying to learn.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.854
Our niece is newly gay
and needs some guidance.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.123
They mean well.

18:44.157 --> 18:45.658
It's all right.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.427
People always think
that being gay

18:47.460 --> 18:49.829
is like being in a secret club.

18:49.862 --> 18:50.897
Is it not?

18:51.898 --> 18:54.133
It kind of is.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.935
You are very funny, James.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.372
Would you mind being
our gay friend, too?

19:01.174 --> 19:02.809
What the hell? Why not?

19:02.842 --> 19:04.311
Wonderful!

19:04.344 --> 19:06.346
Olu, uh, we are
going to need more mugs.
