02:12.090 --> 02:14.467
- This is the biggest job
we've had yet.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.761
- See, that's why
Caesar called us in.

02:16.803 --> 02:20.515
Man, this job ends the
whole Jack Squad era

02:20.557 --> 02:22.475
and it's no better
time to end it

02:22.517 --> 02:24.060
than with the bitch that
started all this by jacking

02:24.102 --> 02:26.104
one of Gray's dudes.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.108
May Gray's soul rest in power,
man.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.320
- Sweet.

02:34.362 --> 02:39.200
I'm gonna earn my fuckin'
stripes today. (chuckles)

02:39.242 --> 02:40.577
- Stripes?

02:40.618 --> 02:42.245
See that's a newbie talking.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.163
We don't do stripes.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.998
We do bones, dog.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.583
And we don't do blue either.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.083
We do black.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.884
Gotta earn your fuckin'
stripes around here.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.430
- That right there is why they
call us the Bone Collectors.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.475
You sure you got the balls
for this kind of work, man?

03:03.516 --> 03:07.145
- Have you ever seen the
balls of a bull?

03:08.229 --> 03:09.022
Hmm?

03:10.815 --> 03:12.609
- Can't say that I have, Jeff.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.236
(Jeff coughs)

03:16.654 --> 03:21.117
- Well, just say they
got some big ass balls.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.204
And mine are fuckin'
bigger than that. (coughs)

03:26.289 --> 03:27.916
- Okay, well if that's the case,

03:27.957 --> 03:30.502
why don't you take the lead?

03:30.543 --> 03:31.544
Why don't you go in
first and check it out?

03:31.586 --> 03:32.796
- Mm hmm.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.172
(gun cocks)

03:34.214 --> 03:35.006
I wanna see them big fuckin'
balls.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.178
- I hope she ain't pretty.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.680
I hate hurtin' pretty bitches.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.225
- Let's go.

03:46.559 --> 03:49.020
(dramatic music)

03:58.321 --> 03:59.614
(door opens)

03:59.656 --> 04:02.242
(door closes)

04:14.337 --> 04:15.588
- Didn't your mother ever
teach you fellas

04:15.630 --> 04:17.507
to knock before entering
someone's home?

04:19.926 --> 04:24.681
- Well, excuse our bad
manners, Ms. Kennedy.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.187
- So we meet again.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.606
It's been a long time, Caesar.

04:33.648 --> 04:34.607
You're all grown up.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.112
- You look a bit
different yourself.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.162
I guess time will do
that to you.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.481
Do you know how much damage you

05:14.522 --> 05:16.816
and your Jack Squad crew caused?

05:18.193 --> 05:21.988
- I do, and I am deeply
sorry about that.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.406
- You and your girls
murdered Gray.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.951
Slit his throat like a pig.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.119
- I didn't kill Gray.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.830
I was just there.

05:30.872 --> 05:31.956
Innocent.

05:31.998 --> 05:32.957
- Innocent?

05:32.999 --> 05:34.459
I am the one who
escorted you in.

05:35.835 --> 05:40.590
Remember, you were part
of the Jack Squad crew.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.927
So that means you are
not innocent.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.262
- That's how you see it?

05:50.100 --> 05:53.019
- I was wondering what happened

05:53.061 --> 05:54.896
to all that money you
stole from us?

06:07.951 --> 06:12.539
Well, let's not prolong
this reunion any further.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.291
- Let's not.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.045
(guns fire)

06:19.087 --> 06:21.589
(shotgun fires)

06:23.925 --> 06:27.053
(shotgun fires echo)

06:33.518 --> 06:36.396
(shotgun fires echo)

06:36.438 --> 06:38.982
- Come on, man, go check it out.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.400
- Come on, man.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.860
You was talkin' about
the big balls and shit.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.486
Come on, man, go check it out.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.320
- Later brother.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.906
(footsteps crunch)

06:46.948 --> 06:48.241
- Come on, man.

06:50.076 --> 06:55.081
- Ooh.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.337
I think she's dead, Caesar.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.129
(gun fires)

07:01.171 --> 07:05.216
Ooh, shit, ooh, (screams)

07:10.388 --> 07:13.350
This bitch shot me in the balls.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.560
- Not the big bull balls.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.896
(Jeff moans)

07:17.937 --> 07:20.565
- Stop whining like a bitch.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.401
(Jeff moans)

07:23.443 --> 07:25.570
You ain't got no balls, boy.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.531

07:28.573 --> 07:30.950

08:55.869 --> 08:59.664

08:59.706 --> 09:01.791
* Otis Redding *

09:01.833 --> 09:04.002
* Had too much soul *

09:04.044 --> 09:05.253
* And you made it *

09:05.295 --> 09:08.965
* Yes, he did *

09:09.007 --> 09:13.595
* James Brown couldn't
mash potatoes *

09:13.636 --> 09:15.347
* But he knew how to beg *

09:15.388 --> 09:17.349
* He made it *

09:17.390 --> 09:18.558

09:18.600 --> 09:22.062
* Aretha was the queen of soul *

- [Announcer On TV] Batter Up.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.647
And Jess Quake.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.317
On the mound, now.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.320
Base, and the wind up.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.112
And the pitch.

09:31.154 --> 09:31.905
There's the hit.

09:31.946 --> 09:32.947
Out to left field.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.534
This one is way out
there and score.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.411
Over the left field fence.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.913
(dialing phone)

09:39.954 --> 09:41.206
* The queen of soul *

09:41.247 --> 09:43.166
(phone ringing)

09:43.208 --> 09:43.958
* She made it *

09:44.000 --> 09:44.751
- Hello.

09:44.793 --> 09:45.877
* She did, y'all. *

09:45.919 --> 09:47.128
* But me, got that *

09:47.170 --> 09:48.838
- Hey girl, just
checking on you.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.173
What happened?

09:50.215 --> 09:51.800
- We broke up and I
threw him out.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.469
- Are you okay?

09:54.511 --> 09:55.762
- Girl, I'm good.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.931
I'm used to people walking
in and outta my life.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.142
Besides, you can't hold a
good woman down for long.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.352
So, what are you telling me?

10:03.812 --> 10:06.314
- Just finished packing
up all the Marco's stuff.

10:06.356 --> 10:09.317
Girl, I am now single,
and I will be just fine.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.653
I do think I'm gonna go
grab a coffee

10:11.695 --> 10:14.739
or a smoothie or something
just to clear my head.

10:14.781 --> 10:15.281
You wanna come?

10:17.701 --> 10:21.037
- Cam, can I have some
more c-c-cereal, please?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.540
- Well, no, you haven't

10:23.581 --> 10:25.834
even finished the cereal
you're eating now.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.711
Save some for next time.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.796
- Oh, C-C-Cam, no fair.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.716
- Girl, I can't go.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.802
I gotta drop Will off
at the Learning Center.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.054
But you enjoy those
green smoothies.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.723
You'll be running to the
bathroom so much

10:39.764 --> 10:42.350
you won't even think about
the breakup with Marco.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.062
I'll drop by later, okay?

10:46.104 --> 10:47.522
- Okay, cool.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.314
All right, bye.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.485
* Got that will *

10:52.527 --> 10:55.739

11:02.996 --> 11:07.500
* My name gonna
cover the world *

11:07.542 --> 11:10.211
* You gonna know me *

11:14.049 --> 11:17.635
(dramatic music)

11:17.677 --> 11:20.972
(calm instrumental music)

11:22.682 --> 11:23.767
- That's her.

11:24.934 --> 11:25.769
Girl's gonna kill me,

11:25.810 --> 11:27.228
but I have to know.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.234
(dog barking)

11:34.152 --> 11:36.571
(dramatic music)

11:36.613 --> 11:38.948
(dog barking)

11:44.621 --> 11:46.539
(dramatic music)

11:46.581 --> 11:49.209
(dramatic music)

11:56.174 --> 11:59.260
(footsteps retreating)

12:07.936 --> 12:10.563
- Are you watching me?

12:10.605 --> 12:11.356
- What would make
you think that?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.691
- Girl, I'm a female.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.567
We know when we're
being watched.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.194
Now, who are you and
what do you want?

12:17.320 --> 12:20.407
- I was.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.326
- Oh, okay, I see.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.620
Look, if you're one of
Marco's little side chicks,

12:25.662 --> 12:27.664
you'll be happy to know
that we broke up today.

12:27.706 --> 12:28.832
So he's all yours.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.624
Enjoy!

12:29.666 --> 12:30.792
- Marco?

12:30.834 --> 12:31.876
I don't know anyone named Marco.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.212
- Listen, the last thing
I have time for

12:34.254 --> 12:35.422
is to fight over a dude.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.551
So, stop following
and watching me.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.593
I ain't here for that.

12:40.635 --> 12:41.219
- I'm okay.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.222
Can I ask you a question?

12:44.264 --> 12:44.973
- What?

12:45.807 --> 12:47.267
- Was your mom's name, Dawn?

12:49.894 --> 12:51.062
- Now why would you
wanna know that?

12:52.480 --> 12:54.983
- Wasn't she best friends
with a lady named Kennedy?

12:56.401 --> 12:59.320
- Okay, now you're
starting to freak me out.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.198
Stop following me and
tell Marco to kiss my ass.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.118
- Jack Squad.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.885
- So, you're Kennedy's daughter?

13:23.511 --> 13:24.137
- In the flesh.

13:28.725 --> 13:29.309
Are you moving?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.104
- Somebody is.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.106
- Is it that Marco dude?

13:38.068 --> 13:39.944
- He wasn't shit.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.697
He couldn't hold a job
and he was sorry in bed.

13:42.739 --> 13:46.659
Now I was willing to deal with
looking for a job, but girl,

13:46.701 --> 13:49.579
you gotta keep me right?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.123
I take care of no one but me.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.426
Listen, I have iced coffee,
coke.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.388
- How about that Goose?

14:09.724 --> 14:13.353
- Well, damn, you might
be all right after all.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.738
(slaps legs)

14:23.780 --> 14:26.533
(funky music)

14:26.574 --> 14:27.951
* I got that will *

14:27.992 --> 14:30.829
* To learn *

14:30.870 --> 14:33.081
* Yes, I have *

14:33.123 --> 14:35.500
* Gonna be a star one day *

14:35.542 --> 14:36.459
- Uh uh.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.252
My God.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.378
It's that bright.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.295
What's up girl?

14:39.337 --> 14:40.588
Hey sis.

14:40.630 --> 14:41.923
Who's that?

14:41.965 --> 14:43.967
- It's a long story.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.302
You gonna need that shot glass.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.722
- Ooh, what are we drinking?

14:48.763 --> 14:49.514
- [Nikki] Goose.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.306
- Straight up?

14:50.348 --> 14:51.057
- [Cam] Let's get it.

14:57.856 --> 15:01.526
So, Cassie, what made you
come lookin' for Nikki?

15:04.571 --> 15:07.032
- Well, I wanted to
meet the daughter

15:07.073 --> 15:08.033
of my mom's best friend.

15:11.953 --> 15:14.330
(snap clicks)

15:28.553 --> 15:29.721
- Is this you and your mom?

15:30.889 --> 15:31.514
- Yep.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.976
- That's one of the only
pictures I have of us.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.147
- Is she still alive?

15:40.815 --> 15:43.026
- No, she was murdered.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.654
- So, your mom was killed?

15:49.783 --> 15:50.575
Mine too.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.959
- My godmother, Pearl,
raised me.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.172
- Well, at least you had that.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.093
I've had to fend for
myself my entire life.

16:23.942 --> 16:25.652
I lived on the streets.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.278
(bottle clinks)

16:27.320 --> 16:30.031
(shot glass clinks)

16:31.616 --> 16:34.244
(snap clicks)

16:43.962 --> 16:45.088
I don't know if you know this,

16:47.632 --> 16:49.676
but after all the jackings

16:49.718 --> 16:51.970
that our mothers did
they got arrested

16:55.348 --> 16:57.183
and my mother took the
rap for all of it.

17:03.064 --> 17:07.027
At the time she went to prison,
she was pregnant with me.

17:11.322 --> 17:14.409
I was born inside
those prison walls

17:14.451 --> 17:16.119
and then taken to foster care

17:16.161 --> 17:18.413
where I bounced from
family to family.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.962
I still kept up with
my mom though.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.259
I would visit her at
that prison,

17:31.301 --> 17:34.262
never being able to hug
her or anything.

17:39.517 --> 17:44.356
The best we could do was to
touch the hard cold glass window

17:44.397 --> 17:47.317
that separated me from her.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.657
We would have long
talks on the phone

17:57.702 --> 18:00.330
and she would tell me how
prison has changed her

18:00.372 --> 18:04.000
from a nice, docile lady
to a hardened woman.

18:08.797 --> 18:13.593
This sketch, it's the
only picture

18:13.635 --> 18:15.220
that I have of me and mama.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.603
She was murdered in that prison.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.192
- I don't know what to say.

18:33.947 --> 18:36.491
(picture clangs)

18:36.533 --> 18:38.410
(purse snaps)

18:38.451 --> 18:39.202
- Look,

18:40.370 --> 18:41.413
- [Cam] Selfie time,
come on girls.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.205
Selfie time.

18:42.247 --> 18:42.997
- Cam.

18:43.039 --> 18:43.790
- No.

18:43.832 --> 18:44.833
- Come on, selfie time.

18:44.874 --> 18:45.625
Come on, come on, come on.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.751
Come on, Cassie.

18:48.753 --> 18:50.797
(camera clicks)

18:50.839 --> 18:54.634
Ooh, look at how we look
in this picture.

18:56.344 --> 18:59.556
Looks like we've known
each other forever, y'all.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.058
- Don't post that.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.103
Girl, we look super
roasted and raw.

19:05.145 --> 19:09.524
- Girl, look, I'll just do
a little filter

19:09.566 --> 19:11.860
and then add some makeup.

19:11.901 --> 19:12.527
- Yes do that.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.070
Okay?

19:14.112 --> 19:16.865
Because ain't nobody got time
for that blackmail pic later.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.783
- Come on.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.245
(camera clicks)

19:22.287 --> 19:25.749
(calm instrumental music)

19:33.298 --> 19:34.924
- Hey Cam, look.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.968
Your show, iPad.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.136
- Yes it is.

19:41.222 --> 19:44.851
Can you not play with
this baseball in here?

19:44.893 --> 19:46.311
Do you remember what
happened last time?

19:46.353 --> 19:49.522
- Yes, but I b-broke the
TV on accident,

19:49.564 --> 19:51.024
but I'm getting b-better now.

19:51.066 --> 19:51.858
Watch my fast ball.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.068
- Will, no.

19:53.109 --> 19:53.860
No.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.031
- Okay.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.373
- Who was that on this card?

20:06.414 --> 20:08.124
- Hey, hey, be
careful with that.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.043
That's a Michael Jordan card.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.421
- I didn't know Michael
Jordan played baseball.

20:13.463 --> 20:17.342
- Yep, with the Chicago
White Sox in 1994.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.970
Batting average 202, 127
games, 114 strikeouts

20:21.012 --> 20:23.682
and three home runs.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.394
- Wait, you remember all that
without looking at the card?

20:27.435 --> 20:28.103
- Yep.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.270
(both chuckle)

20:29.312 --> 20:33.858
I'm gonna be a great
pitcher someday, Cam.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.984
- Of course you are, Will.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.861
I mean, just keep practicing.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.029
- When?

20:38.071 --> 20:40.365
They don't let me
practice there.

20:42.617 --> 20:46.413
- I know you hate being
there at the Learning Center.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.582
- Stop calling it th-the
Learning Center.

20:49.624 --> 20:50.375
It's a home.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.751
A home for handicapped people.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.128
I'm not handicapped.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.005
- I know that, Will.

20:55.046 --> 20:58.049
Doesn't the Learning Center
sound much better than the home?

21:00.802 --> 21:02.512
One day I'm gonna get
you out of there.

21:05.557 --> 21:06.349
I promise that.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.647
(piano music)

21:19.362 --> 21:22.032
(doorbell rings)

21:23.450 --> 21:26.036
- Cassie, can you get the door?

21:30.165 --> 21:32.792
- Now, Pearl, don't be upset,

21:35.545 --> 21:37.547
but I found Dawn's daughter,
Nikki,

21:37.589 --> 21:39.257
and that's her at the
door right now.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.720
Come on in, it's open.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.683
(screen door creaks)

21:58.485 --> 22:01.112
(piano music)

22:03.656 --> 22:04.741
You can sit down.

22:06.326 --> 22:11.081
- Okay.

22:15.043 --> 22:17.962
Wow, this place is comfy.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.555
- Hmm.

22:27.597 --> 22:28.640
You must be Nikki?

22:29.641 --> 22:30.892
- Pearl, right?

22:32.143 --> 22:33.186
- That's right.

22:33.228 --> 22:34.604
I brought you girls some
fresh lemonade.

22:43.822 --> 22:47.033
- Pearl, this is delicious.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.702
What do you put in this?

22:48.743 --> 22:51.746
- It's an old family recipe
passed down from generations.

22:51.788 --> 22:55.333
Lemons, distilled water,
cane sugar,

22:55.375 --> 22:58.086
and a few million dollars
secret ingredients.

22:58.128 --> 23:01.506
I hold this recipe
close to my heart.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.341
- She ain't lying either.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.509
I've been trying to get
her to tell me

23:04.551 --> 23:06.678
what she puts in it for years.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.971
She won't even let me near her

23:08.013 --> 23:09.264
when she's making her lemonade.

23:09.305 --> 23:11.266
- [Pearl] One day I will.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.518
For now, it's your job
to just enjoy.

23:18.314 --> 23:21.026
Girl, your eyes are red.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.028
Look like you've been
hanging out all night.

23:24.362 --> 23:27.323
Here's some Visine to
clear up those eyes.

23:27.365 --> 23:28.241
- I'm good.

23:29.409 --> 23:30.118
Thanks.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.954
- [Pearl] Well, if you
change your mind,

23:32.996 --> 23:34.831
I keep it on me at all times.

23:35.957 --> 23:37.834
My allergies are
always acting up.

23:40.879 --> 23:44.549
- So, Pearl, did you
know my mother?

23:45.884 --> 23:49.054
- I knew of her, but I
never met her personally.

23:52.807 --> 23:56.102
Well, I'll leave you
girls alone.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.228
Nice to meet you Nikki.

24:02.192 --> 24:02.984
- Are you okay?

24:05.028 --> 24:05.945
- Yeah.

24:05.987 --> 24:06.988
I'm okay.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.951
I was just thinking
about how nice it must be

24:11.993 --> 24:15.997
to be raised in a house like
this by someone like Pearl.

24:17.999 --> 24:22.128
Someone that you know loves
you and someone you can trust.

24:25.924 --> 24:28.927
- We are family now
bonded by our moms.

24:28.968 --> 24:29.678
You can trust me.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.851
- This lemonade though.

24:37.727 --> 24:38.895
- I'm trying to tell you,

24:40.188 --> 24:42.607
maybe we can work together
to get the secret.

24:42.649 --> 24:43.525
- For sure.

24:43.566 --> 24:44.317
- Right.

24:46.903 --> 24:50.156
(calm instrumental music)

24:53.118 --> 24:55.495
Mommy, I'm scared.

24:55.537 --> 24:56.996
- Shh.

24:57.038 --> 24:59.249
Cassie, do you know the
difference

24:59.290 --> 25:01.001
between fear and courage?

25:02.002 --> 25:02.794
- No.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.423
- Fear is a reaction.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.843
Courage is a choice.

25:09.884 --> 25:10.677
Do you understand?

25:20.437 --> 25:24.691
Now, this is my heart
and this is your heart.

25:26.067 --> 25:29.988
As long as we have these,
we will never be apart.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.489
Don't lose it.

25:31.531 --> 25:34.909
And if you ever need my
love and energy, I'm there.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.705
(gun shoots)

25:38.747 --> 25:40.415
(gun shoots)

25:40.457 --> 25:43.084
(gun shots echo)

25:46.004 --> 25:49.341
- When I met your mother,
she was very quiet

25:50.550 --> 25:52.135
and closed off.

25:54.262 --> 25:58.350
Eventually, she told me her
deepest, darkest secrets.

26:03.688 --> 26:08.526
She joined in a pact with her
girlfriend's Mona and Dawn.

26:08.568 --> 26:11.446
And they formed a group
called the Jack Squad.

26:13.198 --> 26:15.658
- What happened to all
the money they stole?

26:15.700 --> 26:20.372
- She left us this house and
some money to provide for you.

26:20.413 --> 26:23.208
She said the rest of the money
was hidden in plain sight.

26:32.217 --> 26:34.594
(lamp clicks)

26:37.722 --> 26:40.141
(dog barks)

26:46.648 --> 26:49.275
- I have been trying to
FaceTime her all day.

26:49.317 --> 26:50.902
Her damn phone is cut off.

26:50.944 --> 26:52.445
- I know, right?

26:52.487 --> 26:53.655
I called a few times and I
keep getting this message

26:53.697 --> 26:55.115
that say something like,

26:55.156 --> 26:57.409
"the person you have dialed
isn't available right now."

26:57.450 --> 27:00.662
And then one time, "your call
cannot be completed as dialed"

27:00.704 --> 27:01.454
and then one time.

27:01.496 --> 27:02.956
- Stop.

27:02.997 --> 27:04.708
You're giving me a headache.

27:04.749 --> 27:05.250
I get the point.

27:12.132 --> 27:14.718
(Cassie knocks)

27:17.220 --> 27:19.014
- Bitch, we can see you.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.348
Open the door.

27:20.390 --> 27:25.061
- They could've come pistol
whipped me right now.

27:27.564 --> 27:28.523
(jazz music)

27:28.565 --> 27:29.899
(lighter clicks)

27:29.941 --> 27:32.193
(jazz music)

27:38.700 --> 27:42.287
- Hey, you guys, what are
you doing here?

27:42.328 --> 27:43.079
- Mm hmm.

27:46.207 --> 27:47.083
What is going on?

27:49.294 --> 27:50.128
- Nothing.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.713
I guess I overslept.

27:51.755 --> 27:52.630
- For two days, Cam.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.800
- Look, Nicki been having me
drinking these green drinks

27:55.842 --> 27:56.885
and they running
right through me.

27:56.926 --> 27:57.886
Where's the restroom?

28:00.388 --> 28:01.473
- Right up the stairs.

28:02.599 --> 28:03.558
(Cam sighs)

28:03.600 --> 28:06.269
(footsteps retreat)

28:08.521 --> 28:11.483
(light switch clicks)

28:14.778 --> 28:17.364
(faucet creaks)

28:27.290 --> 28:28.583
- Look, don't be mad at me.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.877
- How am I not supposed
to be mad right now, Cam?

28:32.504 --> 28:33.713
Explain.

28:33.755 --> 28:34.506
- I got a lot going
on right now.

28:34.547 --> 28:36.257
- [Cassie] Cam.

28:36.299 --> 28:37.050
- That's all.

28:37.092 --> 28:38.176
- [Cassie] We're your friends.

28:38.218 --> 28:39.844
You could have told us if
you needed help.

28:39.886 --> 28:41.554
- Cassie, what are you
talking about?

28:41.596 --> 28:42.931
- Look around.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.516
The lights are off.

28:44.557 --> 28:45.892
The water is off.

28:48.019 --> 28:50.522
- I am working on it, all right.

28:50.563 --> 28:51.523
Don't worry about me.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.108
I will figure this out.

28:54.401 --> 28:57.195
I don't wanna keep
talking about this.

28:57.237 --> 28:58.405
This is why I don't
answer my phone.

28:58.446 --> 28:59.197
- Mm hmm.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.283
All of this drama is
making me hungry.

29:04.369 --> 29:05.662
- UberEats.

29:05.704 --> 29:06.788
(snaps finger)

29:06.830 --> 29:07.580
- Yes.

29:07.622 --> 29:10.250
(calypso music)

29:18.383 --> 29:20.260
- Excuse me.

29:20.301 --> 29:22.095
I don't mean to bother
you, beautiful ladies.

29:22.137 --> 29:24.180
I'm gonna be in town for
a couple of days

29:24.222 --> 29:26.224
and I'm looking to
have a good time.

29:26.266 --> 29:28.309
Any of you ladies available
to show me around?

29:28.351 --> 29:31.229
- Dude, you are way too thirsty.

29:31.271 --> 29:32.689
- Yo.

29:32.731 --> 29:33.565
That's stone, sis.

29:34.733 --> 29:35.942
You ain't gotta be so mean.

29:39.362 --> 29:40.947
- That was rude as hell.

29:40.989 --> 29:43.074
- Girl, ain't anybody got time

29:43.116 --> 29:44.951
for these lame ass pickup
lines when our

29:44.993 --> 29:46.953
tacos are getting cold.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.413
- And he seemed nice, too.

29:49.706 --> 29:51.166
Distinguished.

29:52.459 --> 29:55.211
- Probably got a pocket
full of money too.

29:55.253 --> 29:58.882
- Ooh, well maybe I
changed my mind, huh?

30:00.884 --> 30:04.054
Let's see what Mr.
Distinguished is all about.

30:05.930 --> 30:10.685
Hey, actually there are a few
places I'd like to show you.

30:14.230 --> 30:16.816
(calypso music)

30:26.493 --> 30:28.703
- Cassie, where are the lemons?

30:28.745 --> 30:30.622
Do you mind if I use your car?

30:30.663 --> 30:31.664
- Sure.

30:31.706 --> 30:32.999
The keys are on the counter.

30:33.041 --> 30:33.750
- Okay.

30:36.795 --> 30:40.048
(calm instrumental music)

30:49.307 --> 30:50.642
- Did I even bring my wallet?

30:54.104 --> 30:57.691
(buzzer buzzes)

30:57.732 --> 30:59.776
(calm instrumental music)

30:59.818 --> 31:00.568
Can't believe that.

31:02.404 --> 31:03.947
(calm instrumental music)

31:03.988 --> 31:04.739
(horn honks)

31:04.781 --> 31:05.532
(Pearl screams)

31:05.573 --> 31:08.660
(cars crash)

31:08.702 --> 31:12.163
(calm instrumental music)

31:22.841 --> 31:25.343
- Hey Nikki, it's Cassie.

31:25.385 --> 31:27.512
I need y'all to meet me
at the hospital.

31:29.139 --> 31:32.559
Pearl got in an accident,
and I need support.

31:35.020 --> 31:35.937
I'm scared.

31:38.857 --> 31:39.858
I'll be in the room with Pearl.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.067
Just let me know when
you get here.

31:44.195 --> 31:47.699
(calm instrumental music)

31:57.250 --> 31:59.377
- Yesterday afternoon,
I had some labs done.

31:59.419 --> 32:00.211
- Okay.

32:00.253 --> 32:01.171
- So, we're hoping to hear back

32:01.212 --> 32:02.547
from the lab as soon
as possible.

32:02.589 --> 32:04.341
Once we get those results,
I'll call her.

32:05.967 --> 32:10.263
Dr. Sandstone, do you have any
updates on Ms. Pearl Davis?

32:10.305 --> 32:12.849
- She had a major head injury.

32:12.891 --> 32:15.018
She'll need surgery within
the next couple of days.

32:16.811 --> 32:18.730
- I'm checking her
medical records

32:18.772 --> 32:22.484
and she doesn't have
any insurance.

32:22.525 --> 32:25.195
- I'll let you break that news
to her goddaughter, Cassie.

32:26.863 --> 32:29.908
(footsteps retreating)

32:31.409 --> 32:33.036
- Did you hear what they
just said about Pearl?

32:33.078 --> 32:34.245
- Well the good thing

32:34.287 --> 32:35.830
is at least she has a
chance to survive

32:35.872 --> 32:36.956
if she has the surgery.

32:36.998 --> 32:38.333
- I mean it sounds expensive

32:38.375 --> 32:40.418
and the nurse said she
doesn't have any insurance.

32:42.629 --> 32:45.465
- I know how Cassie can get
the money for Pearl's surgery.

32:45.507 --> 32:46.675
- You do?

32:46.716 --> 32:47.592
How?

32:47.634 --> 32:48.677
- Jacking.

32:48.718 --> 32:49.302
That's how.

32:49.344 --> 32:50.428
- Jacking?

32:50.470 --> 32:51.429
Ain't that what y'all's
mamas used to do?

32:51.471 --> 32:52.972
- Exactly.

32:53.014 --> 32:54.307
- Cassie ain't going for that.

32:54.349 --> 32:57.352
- [Nikki] Yes she will
because she needs the money.

32:57.394 --> 32:59.020
My girl Vee is a total scammer

32:59.062 --> 33:00.814
and she lives like a queen.

33:02.107 --> 33:03.483
She knows how to do this, Cam.

33:05.235 --> 33:06.861
we need to pay her a
little visit.

33:09.698 --> 33:11.199
- Let's just go check on Cassie.

33:14.035 --> 33:17.706
- Yeah.

33:17.747 --> 33:21.084
(footsteps retreating)

33:21.126 --> 33:24.629
(upbeat instrumental music)

33:40.061 --> 33:42.689
(Nikki knocks)

33:42.731 --> 33:43.481
- [Nikki] Hey Vee.

33:43.523 --> 33:44.524
- Hey Nicki.

33:44.566 --> 33:45.942
Welcome to the lab.

33:45.984 --> 33:47.277
- This is Cassie

33:47.318 --> 33:48.528
and this is Cam.

33:48.570 --> 33:49.320
- Hey y'all.

33:49.362 --> 33:50.363
Nice to meet y'all.

33:50.405 --> 33:52.240
Everybody gone except
my assistant.

33:52.282 --> 33:53.992
But y'all can go ahead
and have a seat.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.789
I like your shoes.

33:59.831 --> 34:04.794
- [Nikki] Thank you.

34:04.836 --> 34:07.672
So, I already told Vee what
our moms used to do back

34:07.714 --> 34:09.799
in the day and we came
up with a plan

34:09.841 --> 34:11.760
to tweak it a little bit.

34:11.801 --> 34:13.678
- My team came up with a
card that goes

34:13.720 --> 34:15.013
inside a credit card reader

34:15.055 --> 34:16.973
and allows us to get
information through Bluetooth

34:17.015 --> 34:18.808
as soon as we swipe the card.

34:18.850 --> 34:21.227
But on y'all phone it's
gonna show regular.

34:21.269 --> 34:23.480
But on my phone screen
I'm gonna see all that.

34:23.521 --> 34:24.564
Nobody gonna know.

34:24.606 --> 34:27.108
- See, I told y'all she
was a genius.

34:29.027 --> 34:32.614
- But look, you gotta get mens
that's older, like 55 and up.

34:32.655 --> 34:35.158
And if they married even better.

34:35.200 --> 34:37.494
Then after that, take
'em to a room,.

34:37.535 --> 34:38.286
- Hotel room?

34:38.328 --> 34:39.120
- No girl.

34:39.162 --> 34:40.872
That's old fashioned, Airbnb.

34:40.914 --> 34:42.082
Nobody allowed, private.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.333
Just us.

34:43.375 --> 34:44.626
- Well don't you have
to register for that?

34:44.668 --> 34:45.377
- Fake IDs.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.419
Hello?

34:46.461 --> 34:47.212
Fake IDs.

34:47.253 --> 34:48.004
Pay credit card all day.

34:48.046 --> 34:50.006
I'm gonna give y'all all that.

34:50.048 --> 34:51.174
- So, what happens when
they find out?

34:51.216 --> 34:53.301
- They just gonna call
the bank and report it?

34:53.343 --> 34:56.262
It's stolen or it's just,
you know, gone.

34:56.304 --> 34:57.847
Technically we ain't
stole nothing.

34:57.889 --> 34:59.099
We borrowed it.

35:02.018 --> 35:04.604
- Fake ID didn't work for
our moms, but,

35:04.646 --> 35:06.231
- Okay girl, watch this.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.442
(cap clinks)

35:09.484 --> 35:12.112
Whoop, my bad, y'all.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.738
I'm gonna put like four
drops in that

35:13.780 --> 35:15.657
and that should be enough.

35:15.699 --> 35:17.200
One, two, three, four.

35:18.326 --> 35:19.119
Jeff.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.079
Jeff.

35:21.121 --> 35:21.871
- [Jeff] Yes.

35:21.913 --> 35:22.872
- You thirsty?

35:22.914 --> 35:25.083
You look thirsty.

35:25.125 --> 35:28.628
- [Cassie] What's she doing?

35:28.670 --> 35:30.755
- She knows what she doing.

35:30.797 --> 35:31.798
- Hi.

35:31.840 --> 35:32.590
- Yeah, I appreciate it.

35:32.632 --> 35:33.383
- All right.

35:33.425 --> 35:34.092
- All right.

35:39.931 --> 35:43.059
- Y'all see I only put
a little bit of drops.

35:43.101 --> 35:46.229
It's strong now 'cause if not,
he can die.

35:46.271 --> 35:47.022
(body thuds)

35:47.063 --> 35:48.523
- Oops.

35:48.565 --> 35:50.025
- Oh snap.

35:50.066 --> 35:51.735
It still works.

35:51.776 --> 35:54.571
It's gonna be rainin'
cash up in here.

35:54.612 --> 35:56.031
- Cash. Cash. Cash.

35:57.073 --> 35:59.034
- That's how it's playing.

35:59.075 --> 36:00.368
(phone buzzes)

36:00.410 --> 36:01.161
Jim.

36:02.704 --> 36:03.747
But hold on, y'all.

36:03.788 --> 36:04.622
It's important.

36:04.664 --> 36:06.249
Somebody calling.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.126
Y'all let me know now,
all right.

36:08.168 --> 36:08.918
- [Nikki] Okay.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.211
- I be playing.

36:10.253 --> 36:10.962
Hello.

36:15.467 --> 36:17.677
- That's an interesting
perspective you got about this.

36:17.719 --> 36:20.430
- Look, all we are doing
is working the system

36:20.472 --> 36:23.266
that I was born into
by no fault of my own.

36:23.308 --> 36:24.100
Just like you.

36:25.352 --> 36:26.561
Pearl needs you, Cass.

36:27.771 --> 36:31.149
So, are y'all in or what?

36:31.191 --> 36:31.941
- I'm in.

36:34.569 --> 36:35.362
- I'm in.

36:35.403 --> 36:36.154
But Pearl can never know.

36:36.196 --> 36:37.030
- She will never know.

36:38.698 --> 36:42.827
Hey, one thing, let's not keep
any secrets from each other.

36:42.869 --> 36:43.995
Deal?

36:44.037 --> 36:45.163
- [Cam] Deal.
- [Cassie] Deal.

36:45.205 --> 36:45.955
- Woo.

36:47.957 --> 36:49.834
- Okay, so let's be cheesy

36:49.876 --> 36:51.127
and come up with a
name like CNC.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.882
(everyone chuckles)

36:55.924 --> 36:56.966
It's the initials of our names.

36:57.008 --> 36:59.719
- Girl, our destiny is
already laid out.

37:01.096 --> 37:03.473
- [Everybody] Jack Squad.

37:03.515 --> 37:05.308
- Now put your mother
fucking jays in the air

37:05.350 --> 37:08.520
because the Jack Squad is back,
bitches.

37:08.561 --> 37:10.980
(all scream)

37:12.440 --> 37:14.025
- Now, where should we
start looking?

37:18.363 --> 37:19.197
- I know a place.

37:21.408 --> 37:23.201
- Money, money, money.

37:24.327 --> 37:26.037
- [Everybody] Money.

37:26.079 --> 37:27.247
- Money, money, money.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.331
Make it rain, huh.

37:28.373 --> 37:30.291
- [Everybody] Money.

37:30.333 --> 37:31.376
* Chalk it up, baby *

37:31.418 --> 37:32.794
- Three shots of vodka, please.

37:34.170 --> 37:36.673
* Oh, yeah *

37:36.715 --> 37:38.633
* Uh *

37:38.675 --> 37:41.553
* I like that *

37:41.594 --> 37:43.555
* Do it again *

37:43.596 --> 37:46.391
* Yeah *

37:46.433 --> 37:48.727
* Uh, good God almighty *

37:48.768 --> 37:50.228
- Thank you.

37:50.270 --> 37:51.855
- [Cam] We gonna take this shot
and we gonna get this money.

37:51.896 --> 37:52.647
- All right.

37:52.689 --> 37:53.648
- All right, thank you.

37:53.690 --> 37:55.150
- Who's gonna pay for
these shots?

37:55.191 --> 37:57.068
- Do you see how fine we are?

37:57.110 --> 37:57.902
- You're right.

37:57.944 --> 37:59.237
- Thank you.

37:59.279 --> 38:00.030
- Ooh yes.

38:00.071 --> 38:00.822
Pull it up.

38:00.864 --> 38:01.614
Pull it up.

38:01.656 --> 38:02.824
- [Cam] Hey.

38:02.866 --> 38:05.076
Get it all in, there you go.

38:05.118 --> 38:06.536
There you go.

38:06.578 --> 38:07.912
There you go.

38:07.954 --> 38:08.955
* I don't care *

38:08.997 --> 38:09.497
- [Cam] Okay, come on, y'all.

38:09.539 --> 38:10.540
Take your shots.

38:10.582 --> 38:11.958
Thank you, Jack Squad.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.254
* Hey, hey *

38:16.296 --> 38:17.797
* Charge it up, baby *

38:17.839 --> 38:18.631
- Woo

38:18.673 --> 38:20.091
- Aw, yeah, yeah.

38:22.802 --> 38:26.765
I sure hope I don't
see my grandpa in here.

38:26.806 --> 38:29.100
- Girl, I thought you told
me he was dead.

38:29.142 --> 38:29.893
- He is.

38:29.934 --> 38:31.436
That's my point.

38:31.478 --> 38:32.520
It's dead in here.

38:32.562 --> 38:35.190
(Nikki laughs)

38:35.231 --> 38:37.901
- Okay ladies, let's
get to work.

38:37.942 --> 38:39.819
* Charge it on up now *

38:39.861 --> 38:40.612
* Got to do it now. *

38:40.653 --> 38:42.989
* Oh, yeah *

38:43.031 --> 38:48.036
* Lordy, lordy, lordy *

38:48.078 --> 38:48.953
* Look it here *

38:48.995 --> 38:52.165
* Do what you want to do *

38:52.207 --> 38:54.709
* Don't be no fool, now *

38:54.751 --> 38:57.671
- Hey lovely young lady.

38:57.712 --> 38:58.672
- Hey there.

38:58.713 --> 39:00.548
* Got to do it *

39:00.590 --> 39:02.717
* Real good *

39:02.759 --> 39:05.804
* Broken slang *

39:05.845 --> 39:07.889
- You look lonely over here.

39:07.931 --> 39:08.765
You need some company?

39:08.807 --> 39:10.225
- Actually,

39:10.266 --> 39:12.102
- Can I help you?

39:12.143 --> 39:13.311
- Sorry.

39:13.353 --> 39:14.729
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

39:14.771 --> 39:17.273
* Oh, tighten up *

39:17.315 --> 39:20.402
* Oh yeah *

39:20.443 --> 39:22.821
* All right *

39:22.862 --> 39:24.864
* Got to do it now *

39:24.906 --> 39:27.158
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

39:27.200 --> 39:30.286
* Uh, uh, lordy, lordy, lordy *

39:30.328 --> 39:32.872
* Good God almighty *

39:32.914 --> 39:35.000
* Got your number *

39:35.041 --> 39:37.377
* Oh yeah *

39:37.419 --> 39:39.587
* Light it on up now *

39:39.629 --> 39:41.965
* Whatever you do *

39:42.007 --> 39:44.676
* Tighten it on up *

39:46.011 --> 39:48.638
- Ooh girl, I think I
found three potentials.

39:48.680 --> 39:49.806
Frank, Bobby and Mike.

39:49.848 --> 39:51.558
One of 'em I might just like.

39:51.599 --> 39:52.308
Hey.
- Hey.

39:54.019 --> 39:55.395
- I think I got mine
over there too.

39:55.437 --> 39:57.105
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

39:57.147 --> 39:58.106
Yes, okay.

39:58.148 --> 40:00.650
Cassie, did you find one yet?

40:00.692 --> 40:02.110
- Nah, I'm just not
feeling it tonight.

40:02.152 --> 40:05.405
- Girl, too bad.
- That's okay.

40:05.447 --> 40:07.949
- Yeah, well y'all tell
me how it goes.

40:07.991 --> 40:09.409
- Okay.

40:09.451 --> 40:11.453
Money, money, money, money.
- Money, money, money, money

40:11.494 --> 40:12.620
- Money.
- Money.

40:13.913 --> 40:14.914
- Bye, girl.

40:15.915 --> 40:17.125
* Hold up *

40:17.167 --> 40:19.586
* Take my little ol' hand *

40:19.627 --> 40:24.132
* I'm gonna talk if it
takes it all night long *

40:24.174 --> 40:25.550
* Girl, I know *

40:25.592 --> 40:28.511

40:28.553 --> 40:30.472

40:30.513 --> 40:32.766
* About it *

40:32.807 --> 40:36.895
* 'Cause I know that's
the way you're tied *

40:36.936 --> 40:41.775
* I'm gonna get right
down to my business *

40:41.816 --> 40:45.278
* I'm gonna say just
what's on my mind *

40:45.320 --> 40:46.863
* Ain't no other way *

40:46.905 --> 40:49.407
* Better believe it *

40:49.449 --> 40:51.451
* Girl, I want you to know *

40:51.493 --> 40:53.995
* Yeah *

40:54.037 --> 40:55.997

40:56.039 --> 40:58.875

40:58.917 --> 41:01.544

41:03.713 --> 41:09.094
* Uh, uh, hey *

41:09.135 --> 41:12.597
* Tired of all the whispering *

41:14.599 --> 41:18.061
(upbeat instrumental music)

41:31.199 --> 41:33.827
- You got a little
something on your nose.

41:37.497 --> 41:39.499
- That's the good stuff.

41:39.541 --> 41:40.959
You don't know
nothing about this.

41:41.001 --> 41:42.961
- You don't know me.

41:56.099 --> 41:58.226
- There ain't no
amateur at this, huh?

41:58.268 --> 41:59.602
- I'm from the streets.

41:59.644 --> 42:00.854
This is nothing.

42:02.439 --> 42:03.231
Ooh. Ooh.

42:06.109 --> 42:08.111
I love this music.

42:08.945 --> 42:11.281
- This lovemaking music.

42:11.322 --> 42:13.616
They don't make music
like this anymore.

42:14.951 --> 42:17.620
- So are you from here?

42:19.581 --> 42:21.249
- Maybe no.

42:21.291 --> 42:22.250
Maybe yes.

42:23.084 --> 42:24.169
Does it really matter?

42:25.545 --> 42:27.714
Look baby, we done did
all the talking

42:27.756 --> 42:29.049
we needed to do at 291.

42:31.009 --> 42:33.970
I'm ready to see some of
those sexy dance moves.

42:34.012 --> 42:34.721
- Okay.

42:36.598 --> 42:39.684
(phone buzzes)

42:39.726 --> 42:40.727
- Damn.

42:40.769 --> 42:41.936
It's business.

42:41.978 --> 42:42.771
I gotta take this.

42:46.524 --> 42:49.069
So, how's little shit doing?

42:50.070 --> 42:51.654

42:51.696 --> 42:52.530

42:52.572 --> 42:53.740

42:53.782 --> 42:56.034

42:56.076 --> 42:56.826
Right.

42:56.868 --> 42:57.869
That's fine.

42:57.911 --> 42:58.828
I know, I understand.

42:58.870 --> 43:00.455
Yes, yes.

43:01.831 --> 43:02.624
Mm hmm.

43:09.422 --> 43:10.215
Okay, cool.

43:11.383 --> 43:13.510

43:16.388 --> 43:17.097
Bye.

43:18.473 --> 43:19.182
Sorry about that.

43:20.433 --> 43:22.102
Now where were we?

43:22.143 --> 43:24.354
- You gulped that
first drink down.

43:24.396 --> 43:26.106
Would you like another?

43:26.147 --> 43:26.606
- No, I'm good.

43:28.066 --> 43:31.945
You are gonna need it afterwards
to quench your thirst.

43:31.986 --> 43:36.991
- Oh, cool.

43:39.536 --> 43:42.622
- Nice, soft, smooth, sexy.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.463

43:50.505 --> 43:52.048

43:53.299 --> 43:55.510
Frank, wake up.

43:55.552 --> 43:57.387
Damn, that shit

43:58.722 --> 43:59.514
Excuse me, bro.

44:02.058 --> 44:04.269

44:10.775 --> 44:11.568
Oh, Chase.

44:14.738 --> 44:16.031
Uh huh, uh huh.

44:17.657 --> 44:22.662
Oh, United, we stand.

44:23.830 --> 44:25.582
Oh, MasterCard?

44:25.623 --> 44:26.374

Thank you Frank.

44:50.148 --> 44:51.441
You're the best.

44:51.483 --> 44:53.068
Oh, I got a present for you.

44:58.239 --> 45:01.117
Yes, you had the best
time with me.

45:12.962 --> 45:16.341
(calm instrumental music)

45:20.387 --> 45:22.639
(water runs)

45:26.810 --> 45:30.188
(calm instrumental music)

45:38.697 --> 45:41.199
(text dings)

45:52.377 --> 45:54.629
(text dings)

46:00.719 --> 46:03.013
(text dings)

46:10.854 --> 46:11.855
- For Pearl, I'll do it.

46:19.779 --> 46:20.780
(jazz instrumental music)

46:20.822 --> 46:21.656
- It sure is busy outside.

46:22.991 --> 46:25.326
Glad I called outta work today.

46:25.368 --> 46:27.245
- Yeah, this is one of
my favorite Airbnbs.

46:28.997 --> 46:31.708
So should I fix you some drinks?

46:31.750 --> 46:33.126
- [Man] Sure, why not?

46:38.423 --> 46:40.800
(drink pours)

46:43.762 --> 46:47.140
(jazz instrumental music)

46:56.691 --> 46:59.402
(belt buckle clanks)

46:59.444 --> 47:00.987
What's you mixing over there?

47:01.029 --> 47:03.156
- Just a little
something to relax us.

47:03.198 --> 47:06.242
- Shoot, I'm already relaxed.

47:15.335 --> 47:19.339
- Oh, I see you looking at
my Medicaid socks there.

47:22.550 --> 47:25.095
They just keep the
swelling down.

47:25.136 --> 47:27.472
From all my injuries, you know?

47:27.514 --> 47:28.431
From football.

47:34.270 --> 47:36.564
I expect that I actually
have muscles and everything.

47:38.858 --> 47:42.529
They still in there somewhere.

47:45.115 --> 47:48.410
But I promise you
everything still works.

47:49.828 --> 47:53.164
- Yes, very sexy.

47:56.376 --> 47:57.961
- [Man] You be ready
for all this?

48:03.383 --> 48:04.801
Sure.

48:04.843 --> 48:05.844
Enough of these drinks.

48:05.885 --> 48:07.303
I'm ready for the
main attraction.

48:07.345 --> 48:10.181
- No, I'm still just a
little thirsty.

48:10.223 --> 48:12.475
I get lit once I've had
a lot to drink.

48:14.769 --> 48:16.521
- I don't know what lit is.

48:16.563 --> 48:17.313
I like to get freaky.

48:18.565 --> 48:19.607
- Yeah, same thing.

48:21.151 --> 48:23.278
- Well now don't get too
freaky on me now.

48:23.319 --> 48:24.070
I'm an old man.

48:39.961 --> 48:42.839
You ready for all this, girl?

48:42.881 --> 48:44.007
Ugh, ugh, ugh.

48:46.176 --> 48:48.928
Better do my whole
three point stands

48:48.970 --> 48:51.181
from my football playing days.

48:51.222 --> 48:52.724
Yeah.

48:52.766 --> 48:53.475
Hut.

48:54.434 --> 48:55.477

Oh, my back.

48:59.481 --> 49:00.774
All right.

49:00.815 --> 49:03.943
Girl, I'm about to come
over that table.

49:07.739 --> 49:08.990
Hut.

49:09.032 --> 49:11.701
(body thuds)

49:11.743 --> 49:15.163
(jazz instrumental music)

49:51.241 --> 49:52.033
- Hut one.

49:55.161 --> 49:55.954
Hut two.

49:59.124 --> 49:59.916
Touchdown.

50:03.753 --> 50:07.215

50:16.391 --> 50:17.183
Good game.

50:20.228 --> 50:23.606
(jazz instrumental music)

50:33.533 --> 50:36.578
(footsteps retreating)

50:49.341 --> 50:51.801
* Charge it up, baby *

50:51.843 --> 50:56.765

53:13.610 --> 53:15.028
- This money is short.

53:15.820 --> 53:16.613
- Short?

53:17.947 --> 53:19.699
How much is it short?

53:19.741 --> 53:21.576
- Five bands.

53:21.618 --> 53:23.036
- Shit, man.

53:23.078 --> 53:24.245
Yo, whose run was it?

53:25.663 --> 53:27.207

53:34.964 --> 53:39.052
Nah man, my shit is

53:39.094 --> 53:40.762
Somebody had to mess
with it this time.

53:40.804 --> 53:42.222
- So you calling me a liar?

53:42.263 --> 53:45.183
- Caesar, I'm not
calling you a liar.

53:45.225 --> 53:47.519
I'm saying somebody
messed with it.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.312
It's probably one of

53:53.066 --> 53:54.526

53:58.947 --> 54:01.991
(gun fires)

54:02.033 --> 54:04.160
(body thuds)

54:04.202 --> 54:05.787
- With a name like
Fatal, you should've knew

54:05.829 --> 54:07.580
that was gonna happen.

54:10.917 --> 54:15.630
- As I was saying, Slim

54:18.633 --> 54:22.554
Ray, go take care of our
little friends

54:22.595 --> 54:24.764

54:34.983 --> 54:36.651
- We got one here.

54:36.693 --> 54:37.944
* Ain't got time to be *

54:37.986 --> 54:39.654
* Trippin' on these fools *

54:39.696 --> 54:40.864
* Ain't got time to be *

54:40.905 --> 54:42.532
* Takin' all your keys *

54:42.574 --> 54:43.491
* Ain't got time *

54:43.533 --> 54:45.744
- Hey, we need some more ice.

54:47.537 --> 54:48.079
- Really?

54:49.581 --> 54:50.373
Fine.

* Do it *

54:52.917 --> 54:53.793
* Ain't got time to be *

* Ain't got time *

54:59.132 --> 55:01.551
(ice cracking)

55:07.140 --> 55:10.101
- Okay, let's talk.

55:18.151 --> 55:20.945
So, you know you're late
on this week's payment.

55:20.987 --> 55:22.655
- Man.

55:22.697 --> 55:24.366
My guys were supposed to
drop that off.

55:26.326 --> 55:27.077
Honest mistake.

55:28.411 --> 55:33.166
You know those guys
sometimes they don't think.

55:34.918 --> 55:37.671
- Yeah sure, I know how
those guys can be.

55:37.712 --> 55:39.047
- Yeah man, you know?

55:39.089 --> 55:41.091
- But just like you're
responsible for them.

55:45.053 --> 55:45.887
(bag zips)

55:45.929 --> 55:47.180
I'm responsible for you.

55:49.683 --> 55:51.226
You making me look bad.

55:52.727 --> 55:54.104
- Look, oh, God. Oh.

55:56.773 --> 55:59.234
- Now be honest with me.

56:00.902 --> 56:04.572
Is all the money in the bag?

56:04.614 --> 56:05.448
- It's all there, man.

56:05.490 --> 56:06.199
I promise.

56:09.202 --> 56:09.994
- Good.

56:11.705 --> 56:14.374
(bartender groans)

56:19.587 --> 56:20.130
Keep that.

56:22.716 --> 56:25.593
(mysterious music)

56:31.599 --> 56:34.185
(ominous music)

56:39.399 --> 56:40.692
- Man, look brother,

56:40.734 --> 56:42.694
y'all need to help me
count this money, man.

56:42.736 --> 56:44.112
I mean it's a
celebration but still,

56:44.154 --> 56:45.739
you know somebody
running these streets

56:45.780 --> 56:46.948
and it's gonna be me.

56:54.205 --> 56:57.709
- Oh, so you think I'm
about to do it?

56:57.751 --> 56:58.877
It's y'all's job.

56:58.918 --> 57:00.253
That's what I'm paying you for.

57:00.295 --> 57:01.838
- You pay us.

57:01.880 --> 57:03.423
You really wanna be Caesar,
don't you?

57:04.966 --> 57:06.551
- Nah, I don't want
to be Caesar.

57:06.593 --> 57:08.720
I want to be better than Caesar.

57:08.762 --> 57:09.679
Now, open the damn door.

57:12.515 --> 57:13.224
- I got this.

57:14.642 --> 57:15.435
- No.

57:22.901 --> 57:24.319
Ah gotcha.

57:24.361 --> 57:26.237
Paper covers rock.

57:26.279 --> 57:27.322
Beater before that beard.

57:36.706 --> 57:37.624
- [Jay] You know
what I'm saying?

57:38.875 --> 57:40.085
He was my bodyguard on
my first job.

57:43.546 --> 57:46.716
- Man get off that game and
help me count this money, man.

57:48.551 --> 57:50.136
God, you know you not supposed
to be popping on that candy

57:50.178 --> 57:51.513
man, or something.

57:52.597 --> 57:54.265
- [Ray] Fellas.

57:54.307 --> 57:55.183
- Here we go.

57:55.225 --> 57:57.227
- [Ray] How we doing today?

57:58.728 --> 57:59.813
Why so quiet?

57:59.854 --> 58:01.981
When I walked up I
heard the music.

58:02.023 --> 58:03.608
Sound like a little party.

58:03.650 --> 58:04.442
Now crickets.

58:07.654 --> 58:08.947
All right, cool.

58:08.988 --> 58:10.657
Stay silent 'cause the
last thing I need is one

58:10.699 --> 58:13.201
of you want to be thugs
running and screaming.

58:13.243 --> 58:14.911
Then I gotta get you.

58:17.080 --> 58:20.250
So let's keep it
clean and smooth.

58:20.291 --> 58:21.501
Nigga, what you
doing over there?

58:21.543 --> 58:22.419
Get over here.

58:26.006 --> 58:26.798
Hold up.

58:28.550 --> 58:31.553
Ain't you that dancin''
mother fucker?

58:31.594 --> 58:32.053
- No.

58:34.931 --> 58:37.642
- Yeah, that's that chicken
dancing mother fucker.

58:37.684 --> 58:40.478
You got a whole lot of
followers too.

58:43.565 --> 58:45.025
- Damn, I hate liars.

58:48.028 --> 58:50.739
See now you gonna have to
entertain us for a moment.

58:50.780 --> 58:52.615
Dance your way over
to that chair.

58:52.657 --> 58:55.035
(gun fires)

58:55.869 --> 58:56.703
Don't be scared.

58:56.745 --> 58:59.122
I'm actually a fan.

58:59.164 --> 59:00.165
But you need some music.

59:01.875 --> 59:03.501
Y'all niggas give him a beat.

59:03.543 --> 59:04.127
- Yes, sir.

59:05.545 --> 59:08.298
You better dance, nigga.

59:08.340 --> 59:10.842
(hip hop music)

59:12.385 --> 59:13.636
That beat's fire.

59:14.763 --> 59:16.723
Now, it's your turn.

59:16.765 --> 59:21.186
And remember, I might be a
fan but trust me they ain't.

59:21.227 --> 59:23.897
- And the next time
I won't miss.

59:26.691 --> 59:29.361
(footsteps scrape)

59:33.239 --> 59:35.408
- Cool you better in person.

59:36.743 --> 59:37.827
Good for you.

59:39.329 --> 59:40.038
You, fat boy.

59:42.082 --> 59:42.874
Let's talk.

59:47.337 --> 59:49.089
You shorted us on your
payment this week.

59:50.590 --> 59:52.050
Now is that the money
you counting right there

59:52.092 --> 59:53.510
to miss a payment?

59:53.551 --> 59:57.180
I mean see this,
this right here.

59:57.222 --> 59:57.972
I mean, I mean you, you already,

59:58.014 --> 59:59.224
- Why are you stuttering?

59:59.265 --> 01:00:00.392
I asked a simple question.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.228
Maybe I said it too fast.

01:00:05.146 --> 01:00:06.898
Let's try it again.

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:09.025
Is that the missing payment?

01:00:11.236 --> 01:00:12.237
- Excuse me?

01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:16.116
I was just wondering
if you could

01:00:18.576 --> 01:00:20.620
- Now, this is mixed up.

01:00:20.662 --> 01:00:21.496
- If I could.

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:24.207
I'm in the middle of a match.

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:27.919
This battle is
getting real good.

01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:29.045
Can I finish?

01:00:32.757 --> 01:00:33.591
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:33.633 --> 01:00:34.134
Is that is that Fortnite?

01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:37.929
Handle this, Nicky.

01:00:41.891 --> 01:00:43.226
- Fuck your match, nigga.

01:00:43.268 --> 01:00:45.395
- Yeah, fuck your match, nigga.

01:00:47.439 --> 01:00:48.231
- The money.

01:00:51.526 --> 01:00:52.402
- These mother fuckers.

01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:07.876
All there.

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:14.883
We good?

01:01:16.593 --> 01:01:19.137
- Yeah, we're good.

01:01:19.179 --> 01:01:20.513
See that wasn't so hard, right?

01:01:21.639 --> 01:01:22.640
Next time, take your time

01:01:22.682 --> 01:01:25.185
when you're countin' our money

01:01:25.226 --> 01:01:27.520
and I suggest you never
shorts the king.

01:01:27.562 --> 01:01:28.271
Got it.

01:01:33.693 --> 01:01:37.030
(footsteps retreating)

01:01:42.827 --> 01:01:44.079
- Here, take your shit back.

01:01:48.458 --> 01:01:51.878
- Who the fuck did they
think they were, man?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.921
Y'all niggas were scared.

01:01:52.962 --> 01:01:54.172
- Nigga, you were scared.

01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:55.006
- Nobody scared.

01:01:55.048 --> 01:01:56.633
Fortnite.

01:01:56.675 --> 01:01:59.094
I told you that joke was
gonna get you in trouble.

01:01:59.135 --> 01:02:00.804
But take that shit out
your mouth man.

01:02:02.555 --> 01:02:04.849
I know this nigga ain't just
go back to playing the game.

01:02:06.643 --> 01:02:07.435
Stupid.

01:02:09.646 --> 01:02:12.649
(crickets chirping)

01:02:20.615 --> 01:02:23.159
(text dings)

01:02:25.453 --> 01:02:26.204
- Oh, so he's not coming.

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:36.798
(car engine hums)

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.342
(brakes squeal)

01:02:42.303 --> 01:02:44.055
- Let's see what we got here.

01:02:47.809 --> 01:02:49.060
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:02:54.649 --> 01:02:55.859
It's all here.

01:02:57.027 --> 01:02:57.819
$50,000.

01:02:59.487 --> 01:03:00.280
What a week.

01:03:03.783 --> 01:03:04.576
All right.

01:03:06.494 --> 01:03:07.662
Niggas are back.

01:03:09.539 --> 01:03:11.624
(bag zips)

01:03:15.086 --> 01:03:16.880
All right let's see what's
going on on this app.

01:03:19.215 --> 01:03:21.593
(phone dings)

01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:26.056
- A match.

01:03:29.934 --> 01:03:31.061
Oh, and he's fine.

01:03:32.812 --> 01:03:34.814
- Are you available now?

01:03:39.861 --> 01:03:41.112
- I'm available now.

01:03:42.072 --> 01:03:43.907
- Send me the address.

01:03:52.874 --> 01:03:53.667
- Hmm?

01:03:58.672 --> 01:04:01.049
(phone dings)

01:04:02.217 --> 01:04:04.469
- She sent me the address.

01:04:04.511 --> 01:04:05.887
Oh.

01:04:05.929 --> 01:04:06.638
On my way.

01:04:09.808 --> 01:04:11.518
- I'll see you soon, Slim.

01:04:23.822 --> 01:04:24.614
(Slim knocks)

01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:25.865
- It's open.

01:04:25.907 --> 01:04:26.658
Come in.

01:04:27.742 --> 01:04:30.036
(door opens)

01:04:31.621 --> 01:04:32.163
- [Slim] Daisy.

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:36.793
Daisy.

01:04:36.835 --> 01:04:37.544
- Hi, Slim.

01:04:39.421 --> 01:04:40.213
- Wow.

01:04:41.423 --> 01:04:43.091
You are gorgeous.

01:04:43.133 --> 01:04:45.593
- You don't look too
bad yourself.

01:04:45.635 --> 01:04:46.428
What's inside the bag?

01:04:47.512 --> 01:04:49.014
- Oh this.

01:04:49.055 --> 01:04:50.640
This is just my gym clothes.

01:04:50.682 --> 01:04:52.684
Yeah, I don't don't like
leave 'em in the car.

01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:54.352
They kind of smelly.

01:04:54.394 --> 01:04:55.103
- Okay.

01:04:56.021 --> 01:04:57.647
Make yourself at home.

01:04:57.689 --> 01:04:58.398
- Wow.

01:04:59.524 --> 01:05:02.068
Nice place.

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:02.861
- Thank you.

01:05:08.783 --> 01:05:09.909
How about some music?

01:05:09.951 --> 01:05:11.161
You can play off your phone.

01:05:12.662 --> 01:05:14.539
- Is there anything specific
you wanna listen to?

01:05:16.249 --> 01:05:17.500
- You can decide.

01:05:20.086 --> 01:05:22.213
(cork pops)

01:05:27.761 --> 01:05:31.056
* Trembling *

01:05:31.097 --> 01:05:35.769
* Air feels like October skies *

01:05:39.981 --> 01:05:43.193
* Fumbling *

01:05:43.234 --> 01:05:47.947
* Lost all track of
space and time *

01:05:51.326 --> 01:05:54.454
* And I know how
things must seem *

01:05:54.496 --> 01:05:56.081
- You ready for this wet one?

01:05:56.122 --> 01:05:57.499
- Hell yeah.

01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:02.212
* In our shells *

01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:05.048
* It is not so *

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.132
- Daisy, huh?

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:13.640
Why your parents name you that?

01:06:13.682 --> 01:06:17.310
- Well my mom really
like flowers.

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:20.772
- What about you?

01:06:20.814 --> 01:06:22.816
Why do people call you Slim?

01:06:22.857 --> 01:06:23.858
- Hmm? You can't tell?

01:06:25.443 --> 01:06:27.320
- [Cassie] You make a point.

01:06:27.362 --> 01:06:32.325
- Hmm.

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:37.414
You know you got a really
dope vibe about you.

01:06:37.455 --> 01:06:40.166
* So, how can I help *

01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:43.086
* Watching the clouds
pass through *

01:06:43.128 --> 01:06:46.006
* No clue of the time *

01:06:46.047 --> 01:06:46.756
I must say

01:06:48.883 --> 01:06:51.803
* We outline the skies
for the first time *

01:06:51.845 --> 01:06:52.470
I'm very intrigued.

01:06:53.847 --> 01:06:58.852
* We draw the lines just
read in between *

01:06:58.893 --> 01:07:03.648
* I'm tracing you *

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:06.151
* Pause myself *

01:07:06.192 --> 01:07:08.778
I don't wanna start
out like this.

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:11.156
* Before I die *

01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:13.283
- Slim, I need to tell
you something

01:07:14.868 --> 01:07:16.411
and then we gotta get you
to a hospital.

01:07:16.453 --> 01:07:17.829
- Hospital?

01:07:17.871 --> 01:07:19.497
Why, what's going on?

01:07:19.539 --> 01:07:20.248
- I really like you.

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:23.460
But we just met and I
didn't know I was gonna

01:07:23.501 --> 01:07:25.170
be feeling you like this.

01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:29.132
But I put, look Slim, we
don't have time.

01:07:29.174 --> 01:07:34.095
Slim, Slim, Slim.

01:07:37.724 --> 01:07:42.771
* It's funny how sometimes *

01:07:42.812 --> 01:07:47.400
* We need to lose our
way to find our home *

01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:55.367
(bag unzips)

01:07:55.408 --> 01:07:56.159
- Wow.

01:07:57.285 --> 01:07:58.078
Wow. Wow.

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:03.083
I should.

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:10.715
I really liked him.

01:08:10.757 --> 01:08:12.175
Gym clothes, my ass.

01:08:13.551 --> 01:08:16.930
(jazz instrumental music)

01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:33.321
(door slams)

01:08:34.989 --> 01:08:38.368
(jazz instrumental music)

01:08:40.704 --> 01:08:43.498
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.209
(knife slices)

01:08:49.254 --> 01:08:52.799
- Nothing like fresh
veggies from my garden.

01:08:57.303 --> 01:09:00.765
* Every day something more *

01:09:09.482 --> 01:09:12.110
(phone rings)

01:09:13.945 --> 01:09:15.697
- [Nikki] Girl, what
are you doing?

01:09:15.739 --> 01:09:17.741
- Nothing much,
painting my nails.

01:09:17.782 --> 01:09:20.160
- [Nikki] You're doing
your own nails?

01:09:20.201 --> 01:09:21.828
Girl, we are getting money now.

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:23.121
We go to the salon.

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.166
Anyway, how was your last jack?

01:09:26.207 --> 01:09:28.543
- Actually he was a lot younger

01:09:28.585 --> 01:09:30.879
than the ones we usually hit up.

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.340
Honestly, he was nice.

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:35.425
I was up there catching
feelings and shit.

01:09:35.467 --> 01:09:37.093
- [Nikki] Seriously?

01:09:37.135 --> 01:09:38.595
That ain't cool.

01:09:38.636 --> 01:09:41.097
To be real, we know these
niggas out here don't care

01:09:41.139 --> 01:09:42.766
about anybody but themselves.

01:09:42.807 --> 01:09:45.352
Not you, me or Cam.

01:09:45.393 --> 01:09:47.729
That's what makes this
so easy to do.

01:09:47.771 --> 01:09:48.229
No commitment.

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:52.734
I just hope you used
that burner phone

01:09:52.776 --> 01:09:54.527
and didn't give that
nigga your real number.

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:56.279
- I know better than that.

01:09:56.321 --> 01:09:57.530
- [Nikki] Was he cute though?

01:09:57.572 --> 01:09:58.323
- He was fine.

01:10:00.408 --> 01:10:02.369
- [Nikki] What's that
sniffing noise?

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.662
You catching a cold
or something?

01:10:04.704 --> 01:10:06.956
- [Nikki] No, my sinuses
are acting up.

01:10:06.998 --> 01:10:08.833
I just took something for it.

01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:10.085
- Good, 'cause you
sound terrible.

01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:13.421
Damn.

01:10:13.463 --> 01:10:14.089
- [Nikki] What now?

01:10:15.215 --> 01:10:16.716
- I left.

01:10:16.758 --> 01:10:18.176
Nothing.

01:10:18.218 --> 01:10:19.219
Let me hit you back.

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:23.807
Oh my God.

01:10:23.848 --> 01:10:25.266
I left my locket at the Airbnb.

01:10:33.858 --> 01:10:35.485
* Hey, DJ, can you
play that song *

01:10:35.527 --> 01:10:38.321
* Dancing, all night *

01:10:38.363 --> 01:10:40.323
* Hey DJ, can you
play that song *

01:10:40.365 --> 01:10:41.783
* Keep 'em dancing *

01:10:41.825 --> 01:10:43.034
* All night *

01:10:43.076 --> 01:10:45.286
* We got a party going
on right here *

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:47.664
* Everybody else
holding up the wall *

01:10:47.706 --> 01:10:48.998
* Don't be scared *

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.002
(crickets chirping)

01:10:59.843 --> 01:11:02.012
(Cassie knocks)

01:11:02.053 --> 01:11:04.014
* We're gonna have fun
'cause right now *

01:11:04.055 --> 01:11:05.432
* The night's still young *

01:11:05.473 --> 01:11:07.642
* So, right now, let's
go ahead and live it up *

01:11:07.684 --> 01:11:09.019
* You know that *

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:09.853
* We only live once *

01:11:09.894 --> 01:11:10.895
* Let's go *

01:11:10.937 --> 01:11:12.981
* Good vibes we party *

01:11:13.023 --> 01:11:14.774
* Good vibes *

01:11:14.816 --> 01:11:17.861
(Cassie knocks)

01:11:17.902 --> 01:11:19.821
* We party right now *

01:11:19.863 --> 01:11:21.072
* We're gonna have fun *

01:11:21.114 --> 01:11:25.285
* Right now the night's
still young *

01:11:25.326 --> 01:11:27.829
(door opens)

01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:29.748
* Right now there's
gonna be love *

01:11:29.789 --> 01:11:30.582
* You know that *

01:11:30.623 --> 01:11:31.624
(door shuts)

01:11:31.666 --> 01:11:32.500
* You only live once *

01:11:32.542 --> 01:11:33.126
- Excuse me.

01:11:35.462 --> 01:11:37.130
Excuse me.

01:11:37.172 --> 01:11:38.923
- What the hell?

01:11:38.965 --> 01:11:40.008
You scared the hell outta me.

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:41.468
What do you want?

01:11:41.509 --> 01:11:43.011
- I truly apologize.

01:11:43.053 --> 01:11:44.846
I left my necklace in here

01:11:44.888 --> 01:11:46.222
and your property manager
told me I could check

01:11:46.264 --> 01:11:47.349
with you to see if you found it

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:49.059
while you were cleaning up.

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:51.519
(drawer opens)

01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:54.856
- Is this the necklace?

01:11:54.898 --> 01:11:55.648
- Yeah, that's it.

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:56.566
- Uh, uh, uh, uh.

01:11:57.859 --> 01:11:59.486
When was the last time
you were here?

01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:02.447
Maybe a few days ago.

01:12:02.489 --> 01:12:03.865
- Really?

01:12:03.907 --> 01:12:06.201
So, did you also leave this?

01:12:06.242 --> 01:12:06.993
Ha ha.

01:12:07.994 --> 01:12:10.372
And this?

01:12:12.082 --> 01:12:13.583
- No, just that.

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:14.250
- Are you sure?

01:12:15.627 --> 01:12:16.044
Are you really sure?

01:12:17.462 --> 01:12:21.591
- You see, a man overdosed
in this room last night.

01:12:21.633 --> 01:12:24.386
And I wanna know, did you
have anything to do with it?

01:12:24.427 --> 01:12:25.804
- No, I wasn't.

01:12:25.845 --> 01:12:26.554
- Are you sure?

01:12:27.764 --> 01:12:29.307
- I wasn't here last night.

01:12:29.349 --> 01:12:32.727
- The manager called the
ambulance and he's doing very

01:12:32.769 --> 01:12:33.937
bad.

01:12:33.978 --> 01:12:36.147
You sure you didn't have
anything to do with it?

01:12:37.482 --> 01:12:38.316
- Yes.

01:12:38.358 --> 01:12:39.651
Sorry to hear about that.

01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:41.111
- Because you know what?

01:12:41.152 --> 01:12:42.237
Hmm?

01:12:42.278 --> 01:12:45.532
I clean this room every night,
mm hmm.

01:12:45.573 --> 01:12:47.033
And I'm a good cleaner,

01:12:47.075 --> 01:12:49.327
and I clean these rooms to a T.

01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:52.122
And I'm just wondering.

01:12:52.163 --> 01:12:53.540
Huh?

01:12:53.581 --> 01:12:57.335
You sure you don't know
anything about what happened?

01:12:57.377 --> 01:12:58.586
- Yeah.

01:12:58.628 --> 01:12:59.796
Maybe you were off that day.

01:12:59.838 --> 01:13:02.465
- I don't think so.

01:13:02.507 --> 01:13:03.425
But,

01:13:06.928 --> 01:13:08.263
- Thank you for
finding my necklace.

01:13:08.304 --> 01:13:09.389
- [Maid] Mm hmm.

01:13:09.431 --> 01:13:10.598
- Have a great evening.

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.517
- Yeah, you too too.

01:13:12.559 --> 01:13:14.019
In that order, baby.

01:13:22.027 --> 01:13:24.946
(ambulance sirens)

01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:31.244
(machine beeping)

01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:37.876
- Slim.

01:13:45.675 --> 01:13:48.136
(paper crackles)

01:13:56.186 --> 01:13:57.937
I truly am sorry that I
did this to you.

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:02.150
I guess I thought it
was all fun and games.

01:14:02.192 --> 01:14:04.319
It never really was
real until now.

01:14:08.323 --> 01:14:11.242
Me and my girls were riding
around and jacking guys

01:14:11.284 --> 01:14:13.828
and I put some Visine
in your drink.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.332
I guess I put too much.

01:14:17.374 --> 01:14:19.334
I didn't intend to hurt anyone.

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:21.378
Especially not you.

01:14:24.964 --> 01:14:26.091
I don't even know you that well,

01:14:26.132 --> 01:14:31.054
but I like you and you
didn't deserve this.

01:14:33.181 --> 01:14:34.099
No one does.

01:14:37.102 --> 01:14:39.688
I just pray that you
can forgive me.

01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:43.858
(machine beeps faster)

01:14:54.327 --> 01:14:57.205
(indistinct chatter)

01:15:06.506 --> 01:15:10.093
- [Overhead PA] Tyson
returning the patient.

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:15.140
(machine beeping)

01:15:15.181 --> 01:15:15.890
- You up?

01:15:19.185 --> 01:15:20.687
They told me you were in a coma.

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:25.775
- Just woke up.

01:15:27.068 --> 01:15:28.486
Should be back out there
in a day or so.

01:15:29.904 --> 01:15:34.409
- Ray told me you had a
little situation with Jay.

01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:35.535
Did you take care of that?

01:15:36.703 --> 01:15:37.954
- Yeah, I did.

01:15:37.996 --> 01:15:39.497
- Good, good, good.

01:15:39.539 --> 01:15:41.958
So where did you put the money?

01:15:43.668 --> 01:15:45.003
- Money gone, man.

01:15:47.047 --> 01:15:51.760
- Did you just say the
money is gone?

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.931
- Man got caught up
with this bitch.

01:15:56.973 --> 01:15:58.224
She drugged me.

01:15:59.059 --> 01:16:00.060
I had the money.

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:02.812
She jacked me for it.

01:16:06.733 --> 01:16:07.776
Bitch thought I was in a coma.

01:16:07.817 --> 01:16:09.944
She came here and
confessed everything.

01:16:09.986 --> 01:16:11.738
- Hmm?

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.741
- Say her and her girls go
around drugging at jacking

01:16:14.783 --> 01:16:15.033
dudes.

01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:22.207
I guess she thought these
flowers would smooth it over.

01:16:33.093 --> 01:16:35.512
(card smacks)

01:16:35.553 --> 01:16:37.722
- It's funny that you
mentioned the word smooth.

01:16:41.976 --> 01:16:44.312
Back in the day, a guy named
Smooth worked for Gray.

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:47.023
- [Slim] Yeah.

01:16:47.065 --> 01:16:48.900
- He made a fatal mistake
of allowing himself

01:16:48.942 --> 01:16:50.068
to get caught up with a female.

01:16:51.903 --> 01:16:52.904
He got jacked too.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.032
Strange.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.743
Strange, how life
repeats itself.

01:17:00.537 --> 01:17:02.956
- [Slim] I'll tell you
what, when I get outta here,

01:17:04.416 --> 01:17:06.292
you better believe this.

01:17:06.334 --> 01:17:09.796
I'm gonna find that girl
and I'm gonna get my money.

01:17:09.838 --> 01:17:11.339
- Right and wrong, my friend.

01:17:16.052 --> 01:17:20.348
See, she will be found, but
you won't be around to do it.

01:17:22.475 --> 01:17:26.604
And I'm gonna tell you the
same thing they told Smooth,

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:33.945
something that we learned from
Gray that you need to learn.

01:17:36.531 --> 01:17:41.286
And of course, see that's never
put a bitch before business.

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:48.084
- Caesar, come on man.

01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:49.794
Let's talk about this, bro.

01:17:49.836 --> 01:17:50.587
Caesar, hold on.

01:17:50.628 --> 01:17:51.671
- Say good night.

01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:52.964
- [Slim] Hold on.

01:17:53.006 --> 01:17:54.424
- Come on, big man.

01:18:00.055 --> 01:18:03.141
Yeah, come on, you big
mother fucker.

01:18:09.439 --> 01:18:11.691
Yeah, come on, big man.

01:18:11.733 --> 01:18:12.400
Come on man.

01:18:14.069 --> 01:18:15.612
That's my money.

01:18:15.653 --> 01:18:19.699
Come on, always thought
you were a big man.

01:18:19.741 --> 01:18:20.492
- Oh.

01:18:22.243 --> 01:18:25.080
(machine flat lines)

01:18:27.957 --> 01:18:30.460
- [Caesar] Always been a
big mother fucker, Slim.

01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:33.296
(machine flat lines)

01:18:39.010 --> 01:18:39.803
- Sir?

01:18:42.305 --> 01:18:43.098
Sir?

01:18:46.768 --> 01:18:48.395
Oh my God.

01:18:48.436 --> 01:18:49.145
Code blue.

01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:55.068
* I'm just sayin yes *

01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:57.529
* And we know when to shine *

01:18:57.570 --> 01:19:01.032
* I'd like to say good bye *

01:19:02.659 --> 01:19:04.536
(horn honks)

01:19:04.577 --> 01:19:05.328
- Cassie.

01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:06.121
(horn honks)

01:19:06.162 --> 01:19:06.913
Cassie.

01:19:07.997 --> 01:19:09.666
- Hurry up, come one.

01:19:11.251 --> 01:19:13.294
- [Cam] Cassie get your
black ass out the house.

01:19:13.336 --> 01:19:15.839
I said get your black ass
out the house.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.966
- Will y'all shut up.

01:19:18.008 --> 01:19:19.050
Pearl can hear you in the house.

01:19:19.092 --> 01:19:20.051
* Can't stop moving *

01:19:20.093 --> 01:19:21.636
- It's money weekend.

01:19:21.678 --> 01:19:22.929
You should have your
own place anyway.

01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:24.764
* Let's party all night *

01:19:24.806 --> 01:19:27.058
(hip hop music)

01:19:30.937 --> 01:19:33.273
- This is how you
supposed to roll.

01:19:33.314 --> 01:19:35.275
Shit, Pearl actually
did you a favor

01:19:35.316 --> 01:19:36.901
because your car was tragic.

01:19:36.943 --> 01:19:38.236
- [Cassie] Okay, Nikki.

01:19:38.278 --> 01:19:39.112
- 'Cause this how we livin'.

01:19:39.154 --> 01:19:40.697
- Mm hmm.

01:19:40.739 --> 01:19:41.239
- Now that we got that sauce.

01:19:43.199 --> 01:19:44.200
Bitch
- Bitch.

01:19:44.242 --> 01:19:47.912
- Hey I got something to
tell you guys.

01:19:47.954 --> 01:19:49.080
Can you turn that down?

01:19:50.623 --> 01:19:51.875
* Like no one's watching *

01:19:51.916 --> 01:19:52.667
* That's what we want *

01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:54.753
* Let's go *

01:19:57.339 --> 01:19:58.715
- Nicky, you remember that
jack I was telling you about?

01:19:58.757 --> 01:19:59.466
- Yeah.

01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:04.012
- He didn't have any
credit cards.

01:20:04.054 --> 01:20:04.888
Only cash.

01:20:06.431 --> 01:20:09.267
I know we said we wouldn't
take cash, but it was there.

01:20:09.309 --> 01:20:11.061
So I took it.

01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:12.062
- How much was it?

01:20:13.229 --> 01:20:14.731
- $50,000.

01:20:14.773 --> 01:20:16.608
- $50,000.
- $50,000.

01:20:16.649 --> 01:20:17.817
50, girl.

01:20:17.859 --> 01:20:19.235
Now, that's a jack.

01:20:19.277 --> 01:20:21.363
Ooh, we can really go
get that ice now.

01:20:21.404 --> 01:20:22.155
- I can get that bag.

01:20:22.197 --> 01:20:23.948
- Are y'all listening?

01:20:25.241 --> 01:20:28.620
I found out that I
accidentally overdosed him

01:20:28.661 --> 01:20:30.830
and he's in the
hospital in a coma.

01:20:31.915 --> 01:20:32.957
I feel horrible.

01:20:34.167 --> 01:20:36.586
I just want to give him
the money back.

01:20:36.628 --> 01:20:38.880
I just don't feel
right about it.

01:20:38.922 --> 01:20:40.924
- Oh, okay.

01:20:40.965 --> 01:20:42.467
So you wanna give him
the money back

01:20:42.509 --> 01:20:45.053
so he can call the police
and then we go to jail?

01:20:46.596 --> 01:20:47.305
Real smart, Cassie.

01:20:49.224 --> 01:20:51.101
- We are in too deep.

01:20:51.142 --> 01:20:52.977
Did you hear me say I
overdosed him?

01:20:53.019 --> 01:20:54.729
He could die.

01:20:54.771 --> 01:20:55.438
- I really wouldn't
worry about it.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.856
That man dying.

01:20:56.898 --> 01:20:58.900
It might be the best thing
that could ever happen to him.

01:20:58.942 --> 01:21:01.361
No evidence, no crime.

01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:02.153
Just take the money.

01:21:02.195 --> 01:21:02.946
Forget about it.

01:21:02.987 --> 01:21:03.738
- I can't.

01:21:06.032 --> 01:21:08.410
That overdose is the
last straw for me.

01:21:09.703 --> 01:21:10.995
I just don't wanna
do it anymore.

01:21:11.037 --> 01:21:13.707
I'm gonna give the money
back and get out of this.

01:21:13.748 --> 01:21:14.833
- I don't believe you.

01:21:16.209 --> 01:21:19.713
So, you want us to go to
jail, possibly prison.

01:21:19.754 --> 01:21:20.714
Are you okay with that?

01:21:22.215 --> 01:21:25.510
What is old Pearl gonna do
without you, Cassie, huh?

01:21:25.552 --> 01:21:27.721
Listen, I did not get into all

01:21:27.762 --> 01:21:31.266
of this so some sick
bitch can ruin it

01:21:31.307 --> 01:21:32.434
because she caught
emotions for some dude

01:21:32.475 --> 01:21:33.601
and has a little remorse.

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.648
The Jack Squad doesn't
have fucking remorse.

01:21:38.690 --> 01:21:40.734
This is a game.

01:21:40.775 --> 01:21:42.736
We all play it, and
we all know it.

01:21:44.988 --> 01:21:46.698
This is what you're gonna do.

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.658
You're gonna keep that money

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.286
and you're gonna keep
your fuckin' mouth shut.

01:21:51.327 --> 01:21:52.620
- But the man could die.

01:21:52.662 --> 01:21:54.039
- You know what?

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.999
I've had enough for this today.

01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:57.125
Get the fuck outta my car.

01:22:00.003 --> 01:22:04.591
Get your cowardly ass out now

01:22:06.509 --> 01:22:08.094
and keep your
fucking mouth shut.

01:22:11.848 --> 01:22:12.932
(door shuts)

01:22:12.974 --> 01:22:14.100
Don't slam my fucking door.

01:22:22.567 --> 01:22:25.070
Don't say shit to me, Cam.

01:22:25.111 --> 01:22:26.112
- You can't put your
damn seatbelt on.

01:22:26.154 --> 01:22:26.905
- You put yours on.

01:22:26.946 --> 01:22:28.323
How about that?

01:22:28.365 --> 01:22:29.657
She get on my nerves.

01:22:29.699 --> 01:22:31.743
- She don't have no cards
and she acting stupid now.

01:22:31.785 --> 01:22:32.535
- Ain't nobody acting stupid.

01:22:32.577 --> 01:22:34.079
Can you believe her?

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:34.871
God.

01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:39.876
(car motor hums)

01:22:42.837 --> 01:22:44.631
- Wait, stop the car.

01:22:44.673 --> 01:22:45.382
My bag.

01:22:46.299 --> 01:22:47.384
- Hey.

01:22:47.425 --> 01:22:50.095
Hey girl, you know what's up.

01:22:51.513 --> 01:22:52.972
- Ah, ah, ah, ah.

01:22:54.683 --> 01:22:55.225
- [Nikki] What?

01:23:03.775 --> 01:23:06.653
- Well, well, well.

01:23:06.695 --> 01:23:09.197
Guess who's going shopping?

01:23:09.239 --> 01:23:10.365
(both scream)

01:23:10.407 --> 01:23:11.408
- [Nikki] Oh, you know it.

01:23:11.449 --> 01:23:12.951
Oh my God.

01:23:12.992 --> 01:23:14.160
- Oh my goodness.

01:23:14.202 --> 01:23:15.120
And Will is already at
the Learning Center.

01:23:15.161 --> 01:23:16.162
So I got all day.

01:23:17.414 --> 01:23:18.498
- [Nikki] What?

01:23:20.417 --> 01:23:21.209
- Shit.

01:23:23.378 --> 01:23:25.630
I gotta get ready for
this job interview.

01:23:31.928 --> 01:23:33.805
* I'm dressin' to the nines *

01:23:33.847 --> 01:23:35.724
* You know I like to shine *

01:23:35.765 --> 01:23:37.642
* I like to leave an
impression *

01:23:37.684 --> 01:23:39.561
* I like to set a vibe *

01:23:39.602 --> 01:23:41.521
* Got one thing on my mind *

01:23:41.563 --> 01:23:43.356
* Just tryin' to live my life *

01:23:43.398 --> 01:23:45.400
* Goin' out, gonna have
a good time *

01:23:45.442 --> 01:23:47.110
* That's right, I set the vibe *

01:23:47.152 --> 01:23:49.237
* So, it's a game of
ala benita *

01:23:49.279 --> 01:23:50.864
* I'm the hunter, you're
the retriever *

01:23:50.905 --> 01:23:52.741
* Mess them up to know
what the speakers *

01:23:52.782 --> 01:23:54.701
* We party all night *

01:23:54.743 --> 01:23:56.578
* Love this spot
like a sleeper *

01:23:56.619 --> 01:23:57.704
* Can't stop moving *

01:23:57.746 --> 01:24:01.791
- Word on the street is
Slim is dead.

01:24:03.293 --> 01:24:04.210
- It appears so.

01:24:05.378 --> 01:24:07.464
- I'm your number one
Bone Collector.

01:24:07.505 --> 01:24:10.633
Why I gotta hear from somebody
in the street instead of you?

01:24:10.675 --> 01:24:13.470
- Mother fucker, I don't
report to you.

01:24:14.846 --> 01:24:17.349
I run this and don't
you forget it.

01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:20.435
- Come on, Caesar, you
takin' it the wrong way.

01:24:20.477 --> 01:24:21.436
- Yeah.

01:24:21.478 --> 01:24:22.687
- Just concerned
about the money.

01:24:24.814 --> 01:24:25.607
Did he have it?

01:24:29.235 --> 01:24:30.111
- Nah.

01:24:31.529 --> 01:24:32.655
A little rat took it.

01:24:34.449 --> 01:24:39.204
But the rat did leave a little
information at the hospital.

01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:43.750
Seems like someone felt bad

01:24:43.792 --> 01:24:46.044
and left Slim a nice
little apology card.

01:24:56.429 --> 01:24:59.224
- I called the florist
and they gave me all

01:24:59.265 --> 01:25:01.142
of that little rat's
information.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.938
I was able to find her
pics on social media.

01:25:06.481 --> 01:25:10.068
Look at this pic and see if
you see anything interesting.

01:25:13.822 --> 01:25:16.157
The girl in the front,
her name is Cam.

01:25:16.199 --> 01:25:18.118
She has a brother that's
a little slow.

01:25:19.619 --> 01:25:23.289
The girl in the middle,
her name is Nikki.

01:25:23.331 --> 01:25:24.958
And her mother's name was Dawn.

01:25:26.418 --> 01:25:30.088
And the girl in the
back, her name is Cassie.

01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:32.966
And you'll never guess
what her mother's name is

01:25:33.008 --> 01:25:35.427
or should I say was?

01:25:35.468 --> 01:25:38.096
Kennedy, sound familiar?

01:25:42.684 --> 01:25:44.477
- It's Jack Squad.

01:25:44.519 --> 01:25:46.021
Damn, I thought we took
care of them.

01:25:48.606 --> 01:25:50.108
- Well those ladies had kids

01:25:50.150 --> 01:25:52.193
that we obviously
didn't know about.

01:25:55.947 --> 01:26:00.160
- Those bitches don't know
who they fucking with.

01:26:00.201 --> 01:26:01.786
- Time to lay a trap.

01:26:01.828 --> 01:26:04.122
- And catch a dirty rat.

01:26:04.164 --> 01:26:05.540
(traffic noises)

01:26:05.582 --> 01:26:06.583
(Will laughs)

01:26:06.624 --> 01:26:09.210
(footsteps crunch)

01:26:12.422 --> 01:26:15.008
(footsteps crunch)

01:26:52.587 --> 01:26:54.756
- Hey, that's m-my ball.

01:27:02.263 --> 01:27:04.307
- Okay buddy, here's
your ball back.

01:27:06.017 --> 01:27:07.268
- Sorry about that.

01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:09.854
I'm just learning how to pitch.

01:27:09.896 --> 01:27:11.898
I wanna be a great
baseball player someday,

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:15.402
like Hank Aaron and Babe
Ruth and Jackie Robinson.

01:27:15.443 --> 01:27:19.322
But first I have to learn
how to pitch a ball.

01:27:21.866 --> 01:27:23.451
- I like baseball too.

01:27:23.493 --> 01:27:24.244
- You do?

01:27:25.537 --> 01:27:27.539
I like when the ball goes
over the fence

01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:31.835
and they yell, "home
run" and they go wild.

01:27:31.876 --> 01:27:34.212
Yep, that's my favorite part.

01:27:36.089 --> 01:27:37.424
- Well, it looks like you
ain't got nobody

01:27:37.465 --> 01:27:38.258
to play with out here.

01:27:40.135 --> 01:27:41.970
Why don't you throw
me a few balls?

01:27:42.012 --> 01:27:43.138
Let's see what you got.

01:27:44.389 --> 01:27:45.432
- I don't know.

01:27:45.473 --> 01:27:48.727
I'm not supposed to
talk to strangers.

01:27:48.768 --> 01:27:49.394
- What's your name?

01:27:50.562 --> 01:27:51.980
- Will.

01:27:52.022 --> 01:27:52.731
- Okay, Will.

01:27:53.565 --> 01:27:56.192
I'm, I'm

01:27:57.569 --> 01:28:00.655
- You work here at the
Learning Center?

01:28:00.697 --> 01:28:02.115
- Yes.

01:28:02.157 --> 01:28:03.575
Yes, I'm from the
Learning Center.

01:28:03.616 --> 01:28:04.993
- You must be new.

01:28:05.035 --> 01:28:07.954
I've never seen you before.

01:28:07.996 --> 01:28:10.540
- Now that we know each other,
we aren't strangers anymore.

01:28:10.582 --> 01:28:11.833
(chuckles)

01:28:11.875 --> 01:28:15.712
Come on, let's toss the
ball for a few.

01:28:15.754 --> 01:28:17.297
Let me see what you got.

01:28:17.339 --> 01:28:18.048
- Okay.

01:28:25.764 --> 01:28:27.849
- Okay, Will, let's have it.

01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:33.271
One more time.

01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:40.612
Wow, that was better.

01:28:40.653 --> 01:28:41.654
Now try it again.

01:28:41.696 --> 01:28:43.406
This time, control it.

01:28:43.448 --> 01:28:46.117
Don't just throw it, but
have a purpose for the throw.

01:28:46.159 --> 01:28:47.035
- [Will] Purpose, okay.

01:28:50.622 --> 01:28:51.414
Okay.

01:29:04.761 --> 01:29:07.722
(tennis shoe scrapes)

01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:30.036
- See, that was better.

01:29:30.078 --> 01:29:31.579
(Will laughs)

01:29:31.621 --> 01:29:33.206
All you need now is a good mitt.

01:29:33.248 --> 01:29:35.000
- I, I can't wait to
show my sister.

01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:36.292
She's gonna be so p-proud of me.

01:29:37.377 --> 01:29:39.337
- Why don't we go get that mitt?

01:29:39.379 --> 01:29:40.505
We can show her together.

01:29:40.547 --> 01:29:42.716
- Okay, well I should at
least c-call her first

01:29:42.757 --> 01:29:44.384
so she know we're coming.

01:29:44.426 --> 01:29:45.552
- No, no, no.

01:29:45.593 --> 01:29:46.344
Let's not.

01:29:46.386 --> 01:29:48.263
Let's surprise your sister.

01:29:48.304 --> 01:29:51.474
- Well, is there gonna be
ice cream where we're going?

01:29:51.516 --> 01:29:52.559
- Yeah.

01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:53.601
Grab your stuff.

01:29:53.643 --> 01:29:54.644
Let's go.

01:29:54.686 --> 01:29:55.395
- Okay.

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.446
(ominous music)

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:15.040
(refrigerator door opens)

01:30:15.081 --> 01:30:15.832
(Pearl humming)

01:30:15.874 --> 01:30:17.083
- Hello, Pearl.

01:30:20.462 --> 01:30:23.131
(knife scrapes)

01:30:23.173 --> 01:30:24.341
I don't think so.

01:30:32.265 --> 01:30:34.184
- Pearl, where are you?

01:30:36.561 --> 01:30:39.189
I wanna tell you about this
job interview I just came from.

01:30:41.566 --> 01:30:44.152
(ominous music)

01:30:57.207 --> 01:30:59.584
(phone dings)

01:31:03.213 --> 01:31:05.590
- [Caesar] Hello, Jack Squad.

01:31:05.632 --> 01:31:08.009
I bet you're wondering who I am?

01:31:08.051 --> 01:31:08.718
I'm Caesar.

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:13.223
You stole money from a man
named Slim who works for me,

01:31:13.264 --> 01:31:15.058
and I want my money back.

01:31:16.393 --> 01:31:18.186
I have Pearl and Will.

01:31:19.396 --> 01:31:21.773
If you ever want to see
them alive again,

01:31:21.815 --> 01:31:24.859
you need to bring me
what we lost.

01:31:24.901 --> 01:31:27.028
We can write out directions.

01:31:36.746 --> 01:31:38.498
- We all got the same message.

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.083
This dude, Caesar,
sounds dangerous.

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.753
- [Cam] I need my brother back.

01:31:43.795 --> 01:31:45.213
- Okay, he has Pearl too.

01:31:46.506 --> 01:31:48.967
- This is all your fault,
Cassie.

01:31:49.009 --> 01:31:51.011
I told you not to take the cash.

01:31:51.052 --> 01:31:53.346
We said never take cash.

01:31:53.388 --> 01:31:55.515
- Well I planned on
taking it back.

01:31:55.557 --> 01:31:57.892
Look, it shouldn't be
that big of a deal.

01:31:57.934 --> 01:31:59.060
We still have the money.

01:31:59.102 --> 01:32:00.520
I left it in your car,
so go get it.

01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:03.481
- It's not all there.

01:32:05.066 --> 01:32:06.776
- What the hell are you
talking about?

01:32:06.818 --> 01:32:07.986
I didn't spend any of it.

01:32:09.029 --> 01:32:10.822
- We sorta did.

01:32:10.864 --> 01:32:11.781
We went shopping.

01:32:13.199 --> 01:32:14.451
- Are you serious right now?

01:32:15.535 --> 01:32:16.578
How much is left?

01:32:16.619 --> 01:32:17.579
- I don't know.

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:19.789
Maybe 20,000.

01:32:19.831 --> 01:32:22.000
- It was $50,000 in that bag.

01:32:22.042 --> 01:32:23.043
What the fuck?

01:32:23.084 --> 01:32:24.336
I told y'all I was
taking it back.

01:32:24.377 --> 01:32:25.462
- Look, we spent some of it.

01:32:25.503 --> 01:32:26.796
So what?

01:32:26.838 --> 01:32:28.590
You act like we knew this
shit was gonna happen

01:32:28.631 --> 01:32:29.924
like we planned this.

01:32:29.966 --> 01:32:31.426
- Planned or not.

01:32:31.468 --> 01:32:35.013
Without that money, Pearl and
Will are gonna get killed.

01:32:35.055 --> 01:32:36.681
But maybe you don't
understand that

01:32:36.723 --> 01:32:39.768
since you don't have anyone
meaningful in your life.

01:32:39.809 --> 01:32:42.395
- What does me not
having anybody have to do

01:32:42.437 --> 01:32:44.689
with the fact that you
took the cash?

01:32:44.731 --> 01:32:45.690
You dumb ass bitch.

01:32:45.732 --> 01:32:47.025
- Who you calling a bitch?

01:32:47.067 --> 01:32:48.026
- I said what I said.

01:32:48.068 --> 01:32:49.486
- Wait, will you two stop it?

01:32:50.904 --> 01:32:54.115
We are all we got right now,
just us.

01:32:54.157 --> 01:32:55.658
Now instead of
killing each other,

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:57.494
let's just figure this
money thing out

01:32:57.535 --> 01:32:59.120
and get Will and Pearl.

01:33:01.122 --> 01:33:02.123
I think I have an idea.

01:33:04.167 --> 01:33:04.959
Nikki.

01:33:05.001 --> 01:33:05.752
- What?

01:33:06.878 --> 01:33:08.004
- Go get the rest of the cash.

01:33:10.173 --> 01:33:10.965
- Fine.

01:33:12.842 --> 01:33:15.845
(footsteps retreat)

01:33:16.888 --> 01:33:19.182
(door slams)

01:33:22.185 --> 01:33:25.855
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:34.072
- It looks like 50,000 to me.

01:33:38.535 --> 01:33:42.914
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:34:04.352 --> 01:34:08.356
(upbeat instrumental music ends)

01:34:08.398 --> 01:34:10.734
(phone buzzes)

01:34:10.775 --> 01:34:11.484
(phone rings)

01:34:11.526 --> 01:34:13.028
- Hey y'all, it's him.

01:34:14.529 --> 01:34:16.281
Hello.

01:34:16.322 --> 01:34:19.451
- [Caesar] Your ride is
waiting for you.

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:23.872
- What's that?

01:34:23.913 --> 01:34:25.540
- Mind your business.

01:34:26.666 --> 01:34:28.793
- Cassie, can I
borrow these shoes?

01:34:28.835 --> 01:34:30.754
- Yeah, they're outside.

01:34:35.383 --> 01:34:37.052
- Our chariot awaits.

01:34:42.557 --> 01:34:45.143
(ominous music)

01:34:46.728 --> 01:34:49.564
(footsteps scraping)

01:35:00.784 --> 01:35:01.993
- Take them blindfolds off.

01:35:07.665 --> 01:35:09.334
- Where are we?

01:35:09.376 --> 01:35:11.461
- Shut up.

01:35:11.503 --> 01:35:12.545
(gun cocks)

01:35:12.587 --> 01:35:13.338
- Y'all handle this.

01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:15.382
I'm gonna go back out front.

01:35:26.643 --> 01:35:27.977
- Are you okay?

01:35:30.397 --> 01:35:31.481
- Are you okay?

01:35:33.608 --> 01:35:35.735
- Yeah, Cam, I'm okay.

01:35:35.777 --> 01:35:37.779
He wouldn't give me any
ice cream though.

01:35:37.821 --> 01:35:39.114
He's not being nice.

01:35:40.573 --> 01:35:41.533
- Patted them down.

01:35:41.574 --> 01:35:42.742
They're clean.

01:35:48.206 --> 01:35:49.290
- Let's have a little talk.

01:35:50.542 --> 01:35:51.418
Sit the fuck down.

01:35:54.462 --> 01:35:56.089
Sit the fuck down.

01:36:01.678 --> 01:36:05.098
So here we are,

01:36:07.058 --> 01:36:09.936
the new Jack Squad

01:36:11.646 --> 01:36:13.606
and I Caesar.

01:36:16.359 --> 01:36:19.612
I thought that I had
put an end to this shit

01:36:19.654 --> 01:36:22.323
when we killed y'all's mamas,

01:36:22.365 --> 01:36:23.199
but here you are.

01:36:26.369 --> 01:36:31.124
So, you must be Cam, the
one with the slow brother

01:36:33.543 --> 01:36:37.213
(Caesar whistles)

01:36:37.255 --> 01:36:38.715
and you look like you
breathe fire.

01:36:41.176 --> 01:36:45.388
Gots to be Nikki,
Dawn's daughter.

01:36:48.308 --> 01:36:50.185
You over here trying to
look innocent.

01:36:51.519 --> 01:36:53.229
You must be Kennedy's daughter.

01:36:56.524 --> 01:37:00.236
Do you know what the
definition of insanity is?

01:37:00.278 --> 01:37:01.071
- No.

01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:04.074
- It's doing the same thing

01:37:05.367 --> 01:37:07.369
expecting different results.

01:37:09.621 --> 01:37:14.334
So, imagine, to my surprise
that those girls had daughters

01:37:14.376 --> 01:37:19.130
who decided to try the same
thing their mothers did,

01:37:19.172 --> 01:37:21.299
expecting a different result.

01:37:23.927 --> 01:37:26.596
You girls gotta be
fucking insane

01:37:26.638 --> 01:37:29.391
to think you was gonna jack
niggas on my fucking territory

01:37:29.432 --> 01:37:30.350
and get away with it.

01:37:32.852 --> 01:37:35.855
One of you jacked one of
my Bone Collectors, Slim,

01:37:38.817 --> 01:37:39.651
and took his money.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.947
- We gave you the money back.

01:37:43.988 --> 01:37:45.782
We just wanna get outta here.

01:37:45.824 --> 01:37:47.534
We won't tell a soul
about you or Slim?

01:37:47.575 --> 01:37:49.119
- Slim?

01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.204
You don't have to
worry about Slim.

01:37:51.246 --> 01:37:55.959
I took care of him, and he's
six feet under the dirt.

01:38:00.296 --> 01:38:01.923
So, now that I got
my money back,

01:38:04.968 --> 01:38:06.928
it's time to end this for good.

01:38:08.638 --> 01:38:12.642
- Look, Caesar, these are
some young innocent girls.

01:38:12.684 --> 01:38:13.852
They mean no harm.

01:38:14.853 --> 01:38:16.563
Why don't you let me talk to 'em

01:38:16.604 --> 01:38:18.481
and see if I can
straighten 'em out.

01:38:18.523 --> 01:38:19.816
- So you think it's that easy.

01:38:21.234 --> 01:38:26.197
Stacks, take her out
and shoot her

01:38:29.075 --> 01:38:32.203
so I can enjoy ending
the Jack Squad.

01:38:39.961 --> 01:38:40.962
Say goodbye.

01:38:42.297 --> 01:38:43.256
- Wait, wait a minute.

01:38:43.298 --> 01:38:44.174
Wait a minute.

01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:48.970
- Okay, I'll allow you
some last words.

01:38:50.138 --> 01:38:50.847
Make it quick.

01:38:52.182 --> 01:38:54.642
- She said that the rest
of the money was hidden

01:38:54.684 --> 01:38:56.478
in plain sight.

01:38:56.519 --> 01:38:59.731
- Before you kill us, there's
something I need to tell you.

01:38:59.773 --> 01:39:00.899
- [Caesar] Oh?

01:39:02.984 --> 01:39:07.113
- Pearl told me that my mom
didn't spend all that money

01:39:07.155 --> 01:39:08.531
and she hid some of it from me.

01:39:10.325 --> 01:39:12.577
Well, the other day, I found it.

01:39:14.037 --> 01:39:16.623
- [Nikki] You never
told me that.

01:39:16.664 --> 01:39:17.499
- [Caesar] Oh?

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:18.249
- Did you lie to me?

01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:23.755
- Do I detect some
tension in the Jack Squad?

01:39:25.548 --> 01:39:28.426
She didn't tell you
she had all that money.

01:39:28.468 --> 01:39:29.678
Some friend you got there.

01:39:39.646 --> 01:39:42.148
(Pearl coughs)

01:39:44.984 --> 01:39:48.238
- Hey, can you get me some water

01:39:48.279 --> 01:39:50.407
since it's going to be
my last drink?

01:39:50.448 --> 01:39:51.491
No. No.

01:39:51.533 --> 01:39:52.826
I can't drink after you.

01:39:52.867 --> 01:39:53.910
Can you get me one?

01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.081
(Pearl coughs)

01:39:59.582 --> 01:40:02.127
- Since you about to
die, I'll give you that.

01:40:21.688 --> 01:40:24.190
(Pearl coughs)

01:40:27.193 --> 01:40:28.194
- Thank you.

01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:36.870
- Any last requests?

01:40:41.541 --> 01:40:42.334
Goodbye Pearl.

01:40:54.596 --> 01:40:57.140
(gun clanks)

01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:04.147
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you?

01:41:05.857 --> 01:41:07.233
- No, she isn't lying.

01:41:08.234 --> 01:41:09.194
She told me all about it.

01:41:10.695 --> 01:41:13.782
We were just trying to get
the money back to you guys.

01:41:13.823 --> 01:41:15.158
- You knew about this too?

01:41:16.868 --> 01:41:17.786
- Ain't this a bitch?

01:41:21.539 --> 01:41:23.166
- Can't trust anybody, huh,
baby girl?

01:41:25.043 --> 01:41:29.756
Okay, so assuming that
this is true,

01:41:31.341 --> 01:41:32.425
what am I supposed to do?

01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:36.346
Let you go so you can go
get the money?

01:41:36.388 --> 01:41:37.305
- You see any other way?

01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:44.104
- What the fuck is taking
Stacks so long?

01:41:44.145 --> 01:41:47.774
Shelly, go check on Stacks.

01:41:47.816 --> 01:41:49.734
It's too quiet out there.

01:41:49.776 --> 01:41:50.485
- Okay.

01:41:53.196 --> 01:41:56.282
(footsteps retreating)

01:42:00.328 --> 01:42:01.121
- Oh no.

01:42:06.126 --> 01:42:07.544
- [Shelly] Oh, shit, Stacks.

01:42:09.879 --> 01:42:10.797
- Gimme that gun.

01:42:14.134 --> 01:42:15.760
And I'll take these.

01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:19.848
Now, sit your ass down, bitch.

01:42:33.611 --> 01:42:35.655
Drink it, I insist.

01:42:55.759 --> 01:42:57.510
- Hmm.

01:42:57.552 --> 01:42:59.846
(door clangs)

01:43:10.607 --> 01:43:13.193
(tool clatters)

01:43:16.988 --> 01:43:19.157
(gun fires)

01:43:21.951 --> 01:43:22.744
(rifle fires)

01:43:22.786 --> 01:43:25.163
(gun fires)

01:43:28.541 --> 01:43:30.835
(gun shot)

01:43:30.877 --> 01:43:33.546
(guns shoot)

01:43:33.588 --> 01:43:34.506
- I'm on it.

01:43:41.513 --> 01:43:43.807
(gun shoots)

01:43:47.936 --> 01:43:49.688
- What the fuck?

01:43:49.729 --> 01:43:52.607
(gun shoots)

01:43:52.649 --> 01:43:55.068
(gun shoots)

01:43:56.569 --> 01:43:59.072
(gun shoots)

01:44:00.323 --> 01:44:02.492
(gun shots)

01:44:06.746 --> 01:44:09.582
- B-B-Batter up.

01:44:09.624 --> 01:44:10.667
I got him.

01:44:10.709 --> 01:44:12.377
I got got him, Cam.

01:44:12.419 --> 01:44:13.169
- Yay.

01:44:15.547 --> 01:44:16.339
- Come on.

01:44:16.381 --> 01:44:17.382
Come on.

01:44:17.424 --> 01:44:18.174
Follow me.

01:44:18.216 --> 01:44:18.925
Hurry up.

01:44:28.601 --> 01:44:31.438
- The way out is
through that tunnel.

01:44:34.566 --> 01:44:35.525
Here, these go to the
door around here.

01:44:35.567 --> 01:44:36.735
Go.

01:44:36.776 --> 01:44:39.320
(mysterious music)

01:44:49.289 --> 01:44:50.540
- It's okay.

01:44:50.582 --> 01:44:51.332
It's okay.

01:44:51.374 --> 01:44:52.584
- Ugh.

01:44:52.625 --> 01:44:54.085
(gun shoots)

01:44:54.127 --> 01:44:57.464
(rifle shoots)

01:44:57.505 --> 01:44:59.716
(guns shoot)

01:45:01.509 --> 01:45:02.302
- Oh.

01:45:03.928 --> 01:45:06.181
(guns shoot)

01:45:14.105 --> 01:45:15.482
- Cam, go, go, go.

01:45:16.733 --> 01:45:19.027
(gun clicks)

01:45:20.904 --> 01:45:21.696
- Oh.

01:45:26.826 --> 01:45:29.245
(gun fires)

01:45:32.749 --> 01:45:34.668
- What the fuck, bitches?

01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:37.003
- So you bitches been holding
this secret the whole time?

01:45:37.045 --> 01:45:38.254
I thought we made a pact.

01:45:38.296 --> 01:45:40.507
Jack Squad, no secrets.

01:45:40.548 --> 01:45:42.842
You knew where all that money
was and didn't say shit.

01:45:42.884 --> 01:45:44.844
- Nikki, you had to know
I was bluffing.

01:45:44.886 --> 01:45:47.055
I was lying to get us
outta there.

01:45:47.097 --> 01:45:48.139
- I knew it.

01:45:48.181 --> 01:45:48.640
That's why I just played
along with it.

01:45:48.682 --> 01:45:50.225
- Yeah, right.

01:45:50.266 --> 01:45:53.520
My mama told me to never trust
anybody, especially a female.

01:45:53.561 --> 01:45:55.105
She was right.

01:45:55.146 --> 01:45:57.065
From now on, it's every
bitch for themselves.

01:45:57.107 --> 01:45:59.067
- You talking crazy.

01:45:59.109 --> 01:46:00.819
Do you realize we left Pearl.

01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:02.821
We left her to fucking die.

01:46:02.862 --> 01:46:03.905
- [Nikki] We were next.

01:46:03.947 --> 01:46:05.156
She knew that.

01:46:05.198 --> 01:46:08.076
She sacrificed herself
for us the same way my

01:46:08.118 --> 01:46:09.869
mom sacrificed herself
for your mom, you

01:46:09.911 --> 01:46:11.413
and precious Pearl.

01:46:11.454 --> 01:46:13.123
So get over it.

01:46:13.164 --> 01:46:15.000
These guys are not
going to stop.

01:46:15.041 --> 01:46:16.501
We need to get the
fuck out of town.

01:46:16.543 --> 01:46:17.752
- We don't even know
where we are.

01:46:17.794 --> 01:46:19.004
- That's what GPS is for.

01:46:19.045 --> 01:46:20.046
Calm down.

01:46:20.088 --> 01:46:21.339
- Don't tell me to calm down.

01:46:21.381 --> 01:46:22.132
- Stop it.

01:46:22.173 --> 01:46:25.385
Stop fighting please.

01:46:25.427 --> 01:46:26.803
- It's okay.

01:46:26.845 --> 01:46:27.554
It's okay.

01:46:29.597 --> 01:46:33.351
- Like I said, from now on,
it's every bitch for themselves.

01:46:36.646 --> 01:46:39.149
(door bangs)

01:46:40.650 --> 01:46:43.194
- I can't believe she
just ran out like that.

01:46:43.236 --> 01:46:44.904
- Believe it.

01:46:44.946 --> 01:46:46.114
Those drugs got her messed up.

01:46:46.156 --> 01:46:47.866
She been off her game
for a minute now.

01:46:50.660 --> 01:46:51.703
- Come on.

01:46:51.745 --> 01:46:52.829
Let's get outta here.

01:46:57.584 --> 01:47:00.837
(door shuts)

01:47:00.879 --> 01:47:04.174
(calm instrumental music)

01:47:11.723 --> 01:47:15.894
(calm instrumental
music continues)

01:47:22.567 --> 01:47:24.861
(water runs)

01:47:31.242 --> 01:47:33.620
(Cassie sobs)

01:47:41.544 --> 01:47:43.755
(fist bangs)

01:48:03.983 --> 01:48:06.069
(bag rips)

01:48:09.072 --> 01:48:09.864
- Oh.

01:48:10.949 --> 01:48:13.034
(bag rips)

01:48:19.958 --> 01:48:21.960
- Hidden in plain sight.

01:48:32.345 --> 01:48:33.930
- Is that the money?

01:48:39.561 --> 01:48:41.688
- Nikki, what are you doing?

01:48:43.356 --> 01:48:46.026
- Is that the money that
your mom stole?

01:48:47.819 --> 01:48:51.489
The money you claimed
you were bluffing about?

01:48:51.531 --> 01:48:53.450
- Yes, but I was bluffing there.

01:48:53.491 --> 01:48:55.076
I didn't know the
money was here.

01:48:55.118 --> 01:48:56.036
- Lying bitch.

01:48:56.077 --> 01:48:57.203
- Nikki, come on.

01:48:57.245 --> 01:48:58.038
We gotta get outta here.

01:48:58.079 --> 01:48:59.914
They're gonna be coming for us.

01:48:59.956 --> 01:49:01.750
We can talk about the
money later.

01:49:01.791 --> 01:49:03.835
- We're gonna talk about
the money right now.

01:49:05.086 --> 01:49:06.463
That money is mine.

01:49:07.547 --> 01:49:08.840
- Yes, sure it is.

01:49:08.882 --> 01:49:10.091
We can split it, but
we have to go.

01:49:10.133 --> 01:49:11.092
Let's go.

01:49:11.134 --> 01:49:12.719
- Oh, you don't seem
to understand.

01:49:15.638 --> 01:49:17.265
You don't seem to understand.

01:49:19.392 --> 01:49:21.186
I ain't splitting shit.

01:49:27.067 --> 01:49:29.361
That money is mine.

01:49:32.113 --> 01:49:34.491
Let me explain to your
dumb ass in layman's terms.

01:49:36.659 --> 01:49:40.789
Your mama jacked a guy and
stole the money

01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:43.249
that caused Gray to
go after them.

01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:48.171
They had to kill him
or be killed.

01:49:49.839 --> 01:49:53.009
Your bitch ass mama
took off with the money

01:49:53.051 --> 01:49:55.679
and Mona tried to cover
her ass and got killed.

01:49:57.764 --> 01:49:59.849
My mother took the rap
and went to prison

01:50:01.434 --> 01:50:04.354
because she knew your bitch
ass mother wouldn't survive

01:50:04.396 --> 01:50:05.313
in prison.

01:50:08.775 --> 01:50:13.029
Caesar ordered a hit on
your mother and mine.

01:50:15.824 --> 01:50:17.992
He got to my mother first.

01:50:21.371 --> 01:50:23.707
With that being said, your
mother and you owe me.

01:50:32.507 --> 01:50:34.009
But I don't just want the money.

01:50:36.386 --> 01:50:40.140
I want payback for my
mother's death.

01:50:43.226 --> 01:50:45.145
And the only way I can get that

01:50:46.855 --> 01:50:49.607
is if I take that money
and kill you.

01:50:52.277 --> 01:50:55.864
- Nikki, come on, we're
the Jack Squad.

01:50:55.905 --> 01:50:58.366
You don't have to kill me.

01:50:58.408 --> 01:51:01.161
There's enough for us to
get away and start over.

01:51:02.662 --> 01:51:04.372
- You can't be that dumb,
Cassie.

01:51:07.375 --> 01:51:09.377
You never learned to
read between the lines.

01:51:11.796 --> 01:51:12.797
I never liked you.

01:51:14.883 --> 01:51:16.426
We were never friends.

01:51:21.848 --> 01:51:23.183
But we can make a toast.

01:51:25.393 --> 01:51:26.770
With Pearl's good ol' lemonade

01:51:29.856 --> 01:51:33.860
because that will be the
last thing you ever taste.

01:51:33.902 --> 01:51:34.694
Go.

01:51:39.282 --> 01:51:42.660
(refrigerator door opens)

01:51:44.621 --> 01:51:48.124
(refrigerator door closes)

01:51:49.292 --> 01:51:52.337
(glass pitcher clanks)

01:51:56.216 --> 01:51:59.135
(mysterious music)

01:52:13.024 --> 01:52:15.610
(glasses clink)

01:52:17.445 --> 01:52:19.948
(liquid pours)

01:52:36.089 --> 01:52:40.176
To the end of the Jack
Squad for you.

01:53:00.488 --> 01:53:02.115
This is for my mother.

01:53:09.205 --> 01:53:11.374
(gun fires)

01:53:15.920 --> 01:53:18.131
(body thuds)

01:53:23.136 --> 01:53:24.804
- Fear is a reaction.

01:53:29.059 --> 01:53:32.562
Courage is a choice.

01:53:36.691 --> 01:53:38.318
Who's a coward now, bitch?

01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:44.199
* Hey, hey, yes, yay, yes *

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:46.701
* Hey, hey, yes, yay, yes *

01:53:46.743 --> 01:53:49.371
* Hey, hey, yes, yay, yes *

01:53:49.412 --> 01:53:52.040
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

01:53:52.082 --> 01:53:54.751
* Hey, hey, yes, yay, yes *

01:53:54.793 --> 01:53:57.379
* Hey, hey, yes, yay, yes *

01:53:57.420 --> 01:54:00.090
* Hey, hey, yes, yay, yes *

01:54:00.131 --> 01:54:03.343
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

01:54:03.385 --> 01:54:05.929
* The sun is rising *

01:54:05.970 --> 01:54:08.348
* Feel the warmth on my face *

01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:11.142
* There's a lot to do now *

01:54:11.184 --> 01:54:13.728
* But there ain't no race. *

01:54:13.770 --> 01:54:16.314
* I sip my coffee *

01:54:16.356 --> 01:54:19.025
* I'm feelin' fine *

01:54:19.067 --> 01:54:21.611
* No need to work, yeah *

01:54:21.653 --> 01:54:24.447
* I'm gonna take my time *

01:54:24.489 --> 01:54:28.910
* It's a brand new day *

01:54:28.952 --> 01:54:31.413
* Gotta take it on my plate *

01:54:31.454 --> 01:54:35.959
* Gotta take it on my way *

01:54:36.001 --> 01:54:39.254
* It's a brand new day *

01:54:39.295 --> 01:54:42.173
* Gotta take it on my plate *

01:54:42.215 --> 01:54:46.219
* Gotta take it on my way *

01:54:46.261 --> 01:54:48.722
* Take a look out my window *

01:54:48.763 --> 01:54:51.725
* See the birds in the tree *

01:54:51.766 --> 01:54:54.019
* Their songs is inviting me *

01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:56.730
* To sing a sweet melody *

01:54:56.771 --> 01:54:58.023
(tires screech)

01:54:58.064 --> 01:54:59.649
* How do they do it *

01:54:59.691 --> 01:55:02.527
* Not a care or suffering *

01:55:02.569 --> 01:55:04.946
* Wanna step into their world *

01:55:04.988 --> 01:55:07.824
* Who holds the key *

01:55:07.866 --> 01:55:11.870
* It's a brand new day *

01:55:11.911 --> 01:55:14.581
* Gotta take it on my plate *

01:55:14.622 --> 01:55:18.543
* Gotta take it on my way *

01:55:18.585 --> 01:55:22.672
* It's a brand new day *

01:55:22.714 --> 01:55:25.175
* Gotta take it on my plate *

01:55:25.216 --> 01:55:28.720
* Gotta take it on my way *

01:55:28.762 --> 01:55:31.389
(car motor revs)

01:55:39.272 --> 01:55:42.859
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:55:53.078 --> 01:55:57.457
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:10.178
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:56:17.602 --> 01:56:21.981
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:56:31.116 --> 01:56:35.495
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:56:42.919 --> 01:56:47.007
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:56:56.433 --> 01:57:00.812
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:57:12.282 --> 01:57:16.661
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:57:18.663 --> 01:57:22.208
* Charge it up, baby *

01:57:22.250 --> 01:57:24.586
* Full power *

01:57:24.627 --> 01:57:27.964
* Try it *

01:57:28.006 --> 01:57:29.883
* I like that *

01:57:29.924 --> 01:57:32.052
* Do it again *

01:57:32.093 --> 01:57:35.388
* I like that *

01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:39.142
* Good God almighty *

01:57:39.184 --> 01:57:40.810
* Won't you listen to me now *

01:57:40.852 --> 01:57:42.562
* Hey *
