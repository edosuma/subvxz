"Love &amp; Hip Hop"...

00:04.771 --> 00:06.306
{\an7}Anytime I've gotten robbed,
you ain't supposed to

00:06.373 --> 00:09.409
{\an8}go cop a whole new set
of ice a month later.

00:09.476 --> 00:12.379
{\an7}You keep giving these (bleep)
other (bleep) to talk about

00:12.445 --> 00:15.248
{\an8}outside of
your God-given talent.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.517
{\an8}You don't have to be
that corny.

00:17.584 --> 00:19.252
{\an8}I'm about to go meet up
with my joint.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.520
{\an8}Why she didn't
come out tonight?

00:20.587 --> 00:22.389
{\an8}I had a show here.
Maggie, she wound up

00:22.455 --> 00:24.691
{\an8}getting shot in her leg,
so for her,

00:24.758 --> 00:28.495
{\an8}being in crowded, small
places is a challenge.

00:28.561 --> 00:30.764
{\an8}Juju is fake, honey.
Juju is as fake, honey,

00:30.830 --> 00:33.500
{\an8}as a $2 bill,
you hear me?

00:30.830 --> 00:33.500
{\an7}Huh!

00:33.566 --> 00:37.370
{\an7}He threw some words around
that I didn't like.

00:33.566 --> 00:37.370
{\an5}What words around?

00:37.437 --> 00:40.073
{\an8}Talking about you're fake.

00:37.437 --> 00:40.073
{\an8}Me? I'm fake?

00:40.140 --> 00:42.575
{\an7}I came to celebrate you,
although I had to hear

00:42.642 --> 00:44.811
{\an7}from somebody else that
you have a problem with me.

00:44.878 --> 00:48.248
{\an8}Can you guys don't do
this right now? Don't
lose your class, Juju.

00:48.314 --> 00:50.049
{\an7}Yo, this bitch
better (bleep) off.

00:50.116 --> 00:52.519
{\an8}What happened at your
birthday is my fault,
Kimbella's fault...

00:52.585 --> 00:55.221
{\an8}No, it was everybody's fault.

00:52.585 --> 00:55.221
{\an8}Juju's fault.
You cleaning yourself.

00:55.288 --> 00:57.357
{\an7}So I'm the mess,
I'm the issue.

00:57.424 --> 01:01.694
{\an8}Tell Juju, bitch, in her face
you shouldn't even set up
discussing it with Kimbella.

{\an8}Oh, God, this tastes
so good. What's up?

01:49.108 --> 01:51.945
{\an1}Nothing. You know, over here,
killing in Jenga, you know.

01:52.011 --> 01:54.814
{\an8}It's definitely going down at my
house. We brought the games.

01:54.881 --> 01:59.085
{\an5}Have game nights. Have the kids
over, you know, with our family
over there, friends over there.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.387
{\an1}Jules, what's up, baby boy?
What's happening?

02:01.454 --> 02:02.956
{\an5}What's going on?

02:01.454 --> 02:02.956
You all right?

02:03.022 --> 02:05.391
{\an8}I don't feel that good right
now. I feel a little dizzy.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.860
{\an1}I think I'm gonna
go lay down a little.

02:06.926 --> 02:08.595
{\an5}Wanna lay down?

02:06.926 --> 02:08.595
And just rest a little, yeah.

02:08.661 --> 02:11.564
{\an4}All right. You gonna help me
bring him down?

02:08.661 --> 02:11.564
{\an3}Of course.

02:11.631 --> 02:15.001
{\an8}Maino and I have been going
strong for the past two years

02:15.068 --> 02:17.370
and it's crazy to think how much
has happened since we

02:17.437 --> 02:22.408
went on one of our first dates
back in 2016 at Irving Plaza.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.111
That's the place
where I almost died.

02:25.178 --> 02:28.081
Since then, we moved in
together, and not only

02:28.147 --> 02:30.617
is he there for me, but he's
there for my brother Julius.

02:30.683 --> 02:38.892
{\an5}My big brother Julius lives with
us. He's a diabetic. He lost his
vision and he's paralyzed.

02:38.958 --> 02:43.530
{\an5}That, paired with my PTSD
from the shooting is
a lot to deal with,

02:43.596 --> 02:47.500
{\an5}but Maino makes it look easy,
even though I know it can
probably take a toll on him.

02:47.567 --> 02:51.571
{\an5}Where's your napkin?

02:47.567 --> 02:51.571
I don't need one.
I just lick my fingers.

02:51.638 --> 02:54.974
{\an1}All right, that's awesome.
(laughs)

02:55.041 --> 02:58.311
{\an5}(doorbell rings)

02:55.041 --> 02:58.311
Come in! Who that?

02:58.378 --> 03:02.582
{\an4}Aah!

02:58.378 --> 03:02.582
Hey!

02:58.378 --> 03:02.582
{\an3}What's up?

03:02.649 --> 03:07.654
{\an5}Say hi! What's up, bro?
Go give Auntie Maggie
a hug! Go, go! Oh!

03:07.720 --> 03:10.623
{\an8}Maino and I go way back.
He was signed to a label

03:10.690 --> 03:13.459
{\an8}I worked at, so we
became really good friends.

03:13.526 --> 03:17.497
{\an5}Girl, what's going on?

03:13.526 --> 03:17.497
Nothing.
Thanks for coming.

03:17.564 --> 03:21.434
{\an5}Maino called me out one day
to meet the woman in his life,
and it was Maggie,

03:21.501 --> 03:25.939
{\an5}and since then, we have been
inseparable. I love her. She's
like a little sister to me.

03:26.005 --> 03:28.541
{\an5}Girl, I'm so sorry I didn't
make it to the show the
other day at Irving Plaza.

03:28.608 --> 03:31.945
I know that was hard
for you. How was it?

03:32.011 --> 03:35.248
{\an5}I did not go.

03:32.011 --> 03:35.248
Oh, my gosh, girl.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.850
Don't make me feel bad,
'cause I already feel bad.

03:37.917 --> 03:43.122
{\an4}I mean, I know the history.
You got shot, for God's sake,
so I know that that was crazy.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.325
{\an5}It's a lot for me.
I just feel like,
I don't know,

03:45.391 --> 03:47.794
{\an5}something about
the crowds. I just
feel so vulnerable.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.730
{\an1}Girl, I think that
we gotta get past this.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.365
{\an5}Yeah, I know.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.365
{\an1}It can't keep
holding you back.

03:52.432 --> 03:55.368
{\an1}Well, it's been hard for me.
I gotta start small.

03:55.435 --> 03:59.005
It's sad to say that shootings
are so common nowadays.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.475
I try my best every day to move
forward, but it's not easy.

04:02.542 --> 04:06.245
{\an5}I keep thinking about
the "what ifs" and what
could possibly happen,

04:06.312 --> 04:09.082
and to be honest,
it's kind of holding me back.

04:09.148 --> 04:13.653
{\an1}Listen, I was thinking about
putting together a girls' day.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.589
{\an4}I'm thinking maybe we'd
go to the beach. You'd meet
some of my girlfriends.

04:17.656 --> 04:21.995
{\an5}I don't know, girl,
but I'll think about it.

04:17.656 --> 04:21.995
Okay. (laughs)

04:22.060 --> 04:24.797
Hi!

04:22.060 --> 04:24.797
Who's that?

04:24.864 --> 04:26.833
Y'all invited everybody.

04:26.899 --> 04:30.536
{\an7}Hey!

04:26.899 --> 04:30.536
{\an8}Hello!

04:30.603 --> 04:34.407
{\an1}Hi!

04:30.603 --> 04:34.407
How are you doing? Joe.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.809
(overlapping chatter)

04:36.876 --> 04:41.047
{\an1}Look at this one here.
You guys made this?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.282
{\an8}It was all me.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.282
{\an8}Oh, pop in wants Dada.

04:43.349 --> 04:46.519
{\an1}Ooh!

04:43.349 --> 04:46.519
What's wrong?

04:46.586 --> 04:49.489
{\an1}Ooh, look at that. He like,
Daddy, you're not going nowhere.

04:49.555 --> 04:51.557
{\an5}Who do you want?

04:49.555 --> 04:51.557
Daddy, uh-uh.

04:51.624 --> 04:55.828
Pop in. Pop in place.
Pop in place.

04:55.895 --> 04:58.631
{\an5}He just wants everyone.

04:55.895 --> 04:58.631
Yeah. It was like
a split second.

04:58.698 --> 05:00.733
{\an4}Oh, my...

04:58.698 --> 05:00.733
All right,
I'll be back.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.136
{\an1}Y'all do your women thing,
right? Y'all good? Y'all good?

05:03.202 --> 05:05.838
{\an5}If you need me...

05:03.202 --> 05:05.838
We won't need you.
Thank you.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.206
{\an9}(laughs)

05:07.273 --> 05:09.375
{\an1}Girl, the last time
I seen you...

05:09.442 --> 05:12.111
{\an5}That was a little crazy.

05:09.442 --> 05:12.111
It was crazy.

05:12.178 --> 05:14.580
{\an6}What?

05:12.178 --> 05:14.580
We went to Jonathan's party...

05:14.647 --> 05:16.549
{\an6}Oh!

05:14.647 --> 05:16.549
...and it was a mess.

05:16.616 --> 05:19.252
{\an4}All right, anyway, can
we talk about something
more interesting?

05:19.318 --> 05:20.486
Yeah, I'm done.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.455
The birthday party
was just the beginning.

05:22.522 --> 05:26.426
{\an5}Yandy has no idea just how
much more of a mess things
were after the brunch,

05:26.492 --> 05:29.495
but that's not my business.
I ain't tellin' her nothin'.

05:29.562 --> 05:31.964
{\an5}My guy! What's up
with you, man?

05:29.562 --> 05:31.964
Exact same old (bleep).

05:32.031 --> 05:33.633
{\an6}Oh, man!

05:32.031 --> 05:33.633
Good to see you.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.535
{\an5}Hey, my God...

05:33.700 --> 05:35.535
Thank you for having me here.

05:35.601 --> 05:37.970
{\an5}Thank you for coming.
How you been, man?

05:35.601 --> 05:37.970
{\an1}Real good.
Everything is good.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.739
{\an5}You on fire out there.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.739
{\an1}Thank you.

05:39.806 --> 05:42.341
Now you like the Howard
Stern of hip hop, right?

05:42.408 --> 05:46.379
{\an4}I'm happy about all that
(bleep), honestly, because I
remember a different time.

05:46.446 --> 05:49.582
{\an5}I remember a different time.

05:46.446 --> 05:49.582
You did put the music
to a back burner.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.184
You kind of reinvented
yourself, right?

05:51.250 --> 05:54.620
{\an5}Which I commend,
because I think
reinvention for all men,

05:54.687 --> 05:57.223
{\an5}for any business,
is the way to go.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.223
{\an1}Essential.

05:57.290 --> 06:01.627
{\an4}Me, though, I still want
to accomplish certain other
things with the music.

06:01.694 --> 06:04.864
{\an1}I still got a lot to
prove with the game, right?

06:04.931 --> 06:06.532
{\an1}Really?

06:04.931 --> 06:06.532
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:06.599 --> 06:09.802
{\an5}I got a mother that
got health problems,
in and out the hospital.

06:09.869 --> 06:14.841
{\an5}I got a brother who's
in federal custody who's
fighting for his life.

06:14.907 --> 06:17.677
{\an1}So, every day, I gotta get up
and go get it and make sure

06:17.744 --> 06:21.013
that I'm pulling in the money
and pulling in the opportunity

06:21.080 --> 06:25.218
{\an4}that's gonna keep everything
going. And then Maggie's still
dealing with her PTSD.

06:25.284 --> 06:29.689
{\an5}In the back of my mind, I'm
like, damn, man, if I didn't
invite this girl, you know,

06:29.756 --> 06:32.625
she wouldn't be walking with
a limp now. She wouldn't be,

06:32.692 --> 06:35.795
{\an5}you know, with a rod
in her leg, you know
what I'm saying?

06:35.862 --> 06:39.265
{\an5}I definitely still feel
guilt behind Maggie getting
shot, and because of that,

06:39.332 --> 06:42.769
{\an5}I do everything I can
in my power to protect
her at all times.

06:42.835 --> 06:45.204
I really hope to find a way to
get her past the shooting

06:45.271 --> 06:48.908
once and for all, because living
in fear is no way to live.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.944
I feel like she gonna get
through it, though.

06:52.011 --> 06:54.147
{\an5}It look like y'all
holding it down...

06:52.011 --> 06:54.147
{\an3}Definitely.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.415
{\an6}Definitely.

06:54.213 --> 06:56.415
...which is all
you can ask for.

you posting that?

what do I see?

07:52.605 --> 07:59.178
Oh, Jaquae trying to
get Kiyanne back. Hmm.

07:59.245 --> 08:02.181
I know that Jaquae and Kiyanne
aren't a couple anymore,

08:02.248 --> 08:07.787
{\an5}but after seeing that pose that
Jaquae put up, maybe him and
Kiyanne could work it out.

08:07.854 --> 08:11.157
{\an5}It's not like having that old
thing back, you feel what I'm
saying?

08:11.224 --> 08:13.826
{\an5}So do you want your girl
back or you want to
fix it? Like, what is it?

It's both.
The whole package.

you know what I'm saying,

08:18.264 --> 08:21.500
{\an5}if you serious that y'all
could really say, you know,
well, let's work it out.

08:21.567 --> 08:25.638
{\an5}When I posted that picture with
me and Kiyanne, I was just
shooting my shot, see how,

08:25.705 --> 08:31.344
{\an5}you know, how far it could go,
'cause she's all about, you
gotta show me if you want me.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.111
(laughs)

08:33.179 --> 08:35.681
{\an5}I did tell him that, yo,
listen, if you want to
bring Kiyanne here,

08:35.748 --> 08:37.884
then, you know what I'm saying,
I'm all in for it.

08:37.950 --> 08:41.687
{\an5}'Cause sometimes when you're
with somebody, it do take you
having to step back and then

{\an5}y'all break up for
a little bit for you

08:43.655 --> 08:45.791
ain't nothin' out here.
I need my girl back.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.262
Yes, yes, yes, and that's the
type of time I'm on.

08:49.328 --> 08:52.265
I'm glad Jaquae is cool with
seeing Kiyanne face to face

{\an1}Hi.

10:16.515 --> 10:18.417
So, what's going on?

10:18.484 --> 10:20.353
Say what you have to say.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.353
{\an3}Huh?

10:20.419 --> 10:22.655
Say what you have to say.
I was invited by Safaree.

10:22.722 --> 10:25.424
{\an5}I just want to get
a hot dog or something
and enjoy myself,

10:25.491 --> 10:27.560
{\an1}so what is it
that you wanted to...?

10:27.626 --> 10:29.562
{\an1}You look like you have
something to say.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.263
I look like I got
something to say?

10:31.330 --> 10:34.100
{\an4}Yeah. You posted me on
social media like you
want me back or something.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.901
{\an3}Huh?

10:34.166 --> 10:35.901
You're a cloud chaser.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.970
What do you mean,
I'm a cloud chaser?

10:38.037 --> 10:40.873
{\an4}Because you blocked me
and then you post things.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.873
{\an3}No, listen.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.776
{\an5}Oh, no. I was sitting
in the shy.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.776
What's with that?

10:43.843 --> 10:45.845
{\an5}I was in the shy,
trying to holla at you.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.845
You're begging for me back.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.813
{\an1}What you mean?
So, what's wrong with that?

10:47.880 --> 10:52.118
{\an5}You acting like
that's a wrong thing.

10:47.880 --> 10:52.118
What do you mean?
You're a cheater.

10:52.184 --> 10:56.155
{\an5}So last year on my birthday,
Jaquae pulled up with a couple
flowers and, you know,

10:56.222 --> 11:01.961
{\an5}he was real attentive to me, but
later that night, he ended up in
a bed with another woman,

11:02.028 --> 11:05.865
{\an5}so the more I thought about
coming tonight, the more
determined I became

11:05.931 --> 11:10.269
to show Safaree what kind of
person Jaquae actually is.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.805
{\an1}I'm black, I'm white.
There's no gray.

11:12.872 --> 11:17.309
{\an5}How long it took you to
come up with these lines?

11:12.872 --> 11:17.309
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

11:17.376 --> 11:18.944
{\an5}You wanna go bar for bar?

11:17.376 --> 11:18.944
What do you mean?

11:19.011 --> 11:20.679
{\an5}You can't rap!

11:19.011 --> 11:20.679
What you mean,
I can't rap?

11:20.746 --> 11:21.747
I can't rap?

11:20.746 --> 11:21.747
You can't rap!

11:21.814 --> 11:23.215
You can't rap!

11:21.814 --> 11:23.215
{\an3}(laughs)

11:23.282 --> 11:25.117
{\an1}You write music
but you can't rap.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.086
I write music.
Yeah, I write music.

11:27.153 --> 11:30.389
{\an4}Okay, just like you
was saying that you did
everything for Safaree.

11:30.456 --> 11:33.159
{\an5}Have you ever been
on the radio? Have you
ever been on the radio?

11:30.456 --> 11:33.159
{\an1}I have!

11:33.225 --> 11:36.095
{\an5}Jaquae say he wrote
everything for Safaree
only on "Stronger."

11:36.162 --> 11:39.532
He's straight. Took all the
credit from Safaree.

11:39.598 --> 11:43.369
{\an5}This is my best record
I ever put out, so I
just want this remix,

{\an8}So I'm a real world big boxing
fan, and today

13:10.689 --> 13:13.659
{\an8}I came to check out Danny Garcia
at his press conference.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.362
He has a big fight coming up
and he's hoping to reclaim

13:16.428 --> 13:18.998
his welterweight crown,
and I came to support.

13:19.064 --> 13:20.266
What's up, Danny?

13:20.332 --> 13:22.067
{\an5}How you doing, baby?

13:20.332 --> 13:22.067
Work time, man.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.803
{\an5}I like Danny Garcia a lot.
I think he's one of
the young greats.

13:24.870 --> 13:29.508
{\an5}His career resonates with mine.
It's not a guarantee whether
he's gonna win this fight here,

13:29.575 --> 13:32.044
but it's about getting back in
the ring and still giving

13:32.111 --> 13:34.213
your best shot
whether you win or lose.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.848
{\an1}Man, thank you, man.
Thank you for having me, homie.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.250
{\an1}I'ma be there and we gonna
have fun, man. You gonna win.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.352
{\an5}Get this belt back.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.352
(bleep), get the belt back.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.288
{\an5}Get back where I started.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.288
That's what it's about.

13:42.354 --> 13:45.357
{\an4}Got to do it all again.
I got a song called "Do It
All Again." It's about that.

13:45.424 --> 13:48.794
{\an4}You define a man not by
his losses but how he's
really gonna rebound.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.663
How he's rebounding.

13:48.861 --> 13:50.663
{\an1}Exactly.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.097
{\an5}There's always a comeback.

13:50.729 --> 13:52.097
There's always a comeback.

13:52.164 --> 13:53.499
That's what makes you great.

13:53.566 --> 13:55.701
A champion always gets back up,
regardless to what,

13:55.768 --> 13:58.871
{\an5}no matter what, and that's
exactly what I'm trying
to get Maggie to do.

13:58.938 --> 14:04.109
{\an5}She's been struggling with PTSD
ever since the shooting at my
event, and I want her to know,

14:04.176 --> 14:07.046
you can't let one bad night
define your whole life.

14:07.112 --> 14:11.083
{\an5}I feel like it's time for
her to wipe herself up
and get back out there,

14:11.150 --> 14:14.787
{\an5}so I'm thinking that this
Danny fight at the Barclay's
will be a great first step

14:14.853 --> 14:17.423
because I want her to see that
she can be at a big event

14:17.489 --> 14:20.192
with a big crowd and ain't
nothin' gonna happen.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.727
{\an1}You don't... Listen,
you don't need no luck.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.662
{\an5}There you go.
All the work is put in.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.662
I'ma be there.

14:23.729 --> 14:27.399
{\an4}All I gotta do is be messin'
and ready and it's my show
and you're gonna see a show.

14:27.466 --> 14:29.201
{\an1}Let's go.
And we gonna celebrate.

14:29.268 --> 14:30.536
{\an1}After.

14:29.268 --> 14:30.536
{\an3}After.

14:30.603 --> 14:31.704
All right. Maybe we'll
go to the strip club.

14:31.770 --> 14:34.974

14:54.693 --> 14:59.331
{\an5}and bring everybody
together to take the beef
down a few notches.

14:59.398 --> 15:03.602
Juju and I were able to squash
our differences like grown women

15:03.669 --> 15:07.373

the same thing, but honestly,

15:07.439 --> 15:09.808

her offer and come out to the
beach in hopes that it will be

15:24.290 --> 15:28.727
{\an5}the first step in the right
direction to getting over my
fear of being in crowded places.

15:28.794 --> 15:32.765

15:37.002 --> 15:39.505
This is where
the bullet went in,

15:39.571 --> 15:42.174
but they had to
stretch it a little bit.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.276
{\an5}Did they take the bullet
out from here?

15:42.241 --> 15:44.276
No, it's still in.

15:44.343 --> 15:46.545

in your leg?

to be honest with you.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.007
I just don't have time
for any more men.

16:15.074 --> 16:19.878
{\an5}I love Yandy and I'm happy
we're able to put our
differences to the side,

16:19.945 --> 16:25.017
{\an5}but she didn't exactly
tell me who was gonna be
at this beach day,

16:25.084 --> 16:29.855

{\an8}This petty beef with Jonathan is
getting more and more annoying,

28:38.450 --> 28:43.855
{\an8}especially after Anais said that
Jonathan had so much more to say
about me at this brunch,

28:43.922 --> 28:47.459
{\an5}but he said that he was
really broken up about
everything that happened

28:47.525 --> 28:52.464
{\an5}and he promised me that
we can have a mature
conversation, so, okay,

28:52.530 --> 28:59.737
{\an5}I'm giving Jonathan one last

apologize for how he treated me.

Hey, you look pretty.

all the extra noise.

29:12.917 --> 29:17.288
{\an5}Whether it be Anais over here
or Kimbella over there,
I want her to hear it from me.

29:17.355 --> 29:22.494
{\an5}Things escalated so quickly at
my birthday that we never even
finished our conversation,

29:22.560 --> 29:25.897
and as friends, we owe it to
each other to hash this out.

{\an1}I know how big
your birthdays are for you

expecting to have a good
time with all my friends.

29:37.008 --> 29:39.711
By you and Anais because
if I'm coming to you...

29:39.777 --> 29:41.513
But "ambushed" sounds
like it's a set-up.

29:41.579 --> 29:44.516
{\an5}So you feel like
I had a previous
conversation with Anais

29:44.582 --> 29:47.819
and I said, when you
see Juju, go for it.

For one,
I want to say this.

29:52.390 --> 29:58.096

behavior on my birthday.

{\an5}What you don't know,
because we haven't had
a moment to sit down,

30:01.366 --> 30:03.568
is I had a full
sit-down with her.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.737
Kimbella was there,
Cyn was there,

30:05.803 --> 30:10.441
{\an5}and I got on Anais' ass
for how she handled you.
I didn't like it.

30:10.508 --> 30:13.945
{\an1}At the beach, your friend Anais
tried to start back up

30:14.012 --> 30:17.982
{\an4}and say that same meeting
that you're talking about,
you were talking about me there.

30:18.049 --> 30:21.886
{\an5}She felt everybody was
there but me, that I
should have been there.

30:18.049 --> 30:21.886
{\an3}Okay.

30:21.953 --> 30:24.189
{\an1}Did I entertain her?
No.

30:24.255 --> 30:26.824
Shocked surprise. Of course
Anais is stirring the pot

30:26.891 --> 30:28.726
and talking about
me behind my back.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.262
{\an4}I know your character.
Well, I thought I
know your character,

30:31.329 --> 30:33.598
{\an4}but I would have never
expected to have a
conversation with Kimbella.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.967
{\an4}You called me fake
and phony. You and I
are bigger than that.

30:36.034 --> 30:43.341
{\an4}I apologize because our mutual
friends should not be my sound

{\an5}you know,
that you're secretive
or whatever,

30:48.279 --> 30:52.183

because I felt like there's
so many conversations

{\an5}Your pain is because
of what I said.
My pain is the podcast.

31:04.429 --> 31:08.333

like Juju just took my idea
and ran with it,

31:08.399 --> 31:10.702

that I'm having.

31:10.768 --> 31:13.905

you handled the situation.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.607
You don't handle your friends
like that,

31:15.673 --> 31:19.244
