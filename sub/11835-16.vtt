WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:03.804
I'm not sure how I'll react
on the witness stand.

00:03.836 --> 00:06.607
Patricia,
I know you can do it.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.809
Mr. MacIntyre--

00:10.577 --> 00:12.112
He was like an uncle to me.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.147
This man killed your father.

00:16.116 --> 00:19.152
I don't want to sound flip,
but that isn't much of an uncle.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.888
You said that he was linked
to organized crime.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.490
You said
that he's killed before.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.594
And I've tried convicting
him once before,

00:27.628 --> 00:30.330
so I'm taking a real personal
interest in this case.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.866
But you have to remember,

00:32.899 --> 00:35.702
the judge ruled MacIntyre's
priors inadmissible.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.139
The jury can't hear
about his record.

00:40.774 --> 00:44.911
Look, there's something else
we should discuss.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.981
One of our witnesses--
the better of the two--

00:48.014 --> 00:50.016
just left town.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.852
Her mother's
in critical condition

00:51.885 --> 00:53.854
after a car accident
in Florida.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.155
Meaning?

00:55.188 --> 00:58.024
Well, if we're unable
to get her back in time,

00:58.058 --> 01:01.261
we'll be depending even more
on your testimony,

01:01.294 --> 01:05.498
as well as the testimony of the
other witness, Charles Rossi.

01:05.532 --> 01:08.268
Mr. Rossi--
"Charlie's" good enough.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.402
Bobby Donnell.

01:09.435 --> 01:12.072
Appreciate you coming in.
Please, sit down.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.612
It's been a long day.
I'll get straight to it.

01:18.645 --> 01:21.782
We've been trying to get a hold
of you for over two months.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.249
Suddenly you call
out of the blue

01:23.283 --> 01:24.585
and ask to see us right away.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.452
What's going on?

01:28.188 --> 01:31.424
I've never been asked to be
a witness in a trial,

01:31.457 --> 01:33.660
so I didn't know what to do,

01:33.694 --> 01:36.997
but the guy I fingered
for the murder--

01:37.030 --> 01:38.765
he didn't do it.

01:41.635 --> 01:43.504
What do you mean,
"didn't do it"?

01:43.537 --> 01:44.838
He's not the guy.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.840
Look, I originally picked him

01:46.873 --> 01:49.743
out of a bunch of photographs,
and I was wrong.

01:50.877 --> 01:52.879
And how did you come
to realize this?

01:52.913 --> 01:55.481
Today's newspaper.
I saw MacIntyre's picture.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.784
The guy that night--
he looked different.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.221
Did you tell
the district attorney?

02:01.254 --> 02:05.225
No. I wasn't sure where to go.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.828
You are the ones representing
MacIntyre, right?

02:09.229 --> 02:11.732
Mr. Rossi-- Charlie--

02:11.765 --> 02:13.834
you testified
before the Grand Jury

02:13.867 --> 02:16.603
that you saw our client leaving
the scene of the crime.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.840
Now you're telling me
that you were mistaken.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.542
What's to say you won't change
your testimony tomorrow

02:21.575 --> 02:23.443
when you take the stand?

02:23.476 --> 02:27.247
Mr. Donnell, this guy,
MacIntyre

02:27.280 --> 02:29.750
didn't kill anyone here.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.417
And I don't think
someone should go to jail

02:31.451 --> 02:32.753
for something they didn't do.

02:42.629 --> 02:44.397
What do you think?

02:44.430 --> 02:46.800
I think we don't look
a gift horse in the mouth.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.069
How about getting a statement?

02:49.102 --> 02:51.137
Not on our client's life.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.206
We'd be obligated
to tell the DA.

02:54.908 --> 02:58.612
This is Michael MacIntyre's
lucky day.

03:03.049 --> 03:06.052
(music playing)

03:54.167 --> 03:57.403
We have been over this.
I want to take the stand.

03:57.437 --> 03:59.139
You do that,
and your record could come in.

03:59.172 --> 04:01.307
I don't care!
You should care.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.277
You were tried once for killing
your former business partner,

04:04.310 --> 04:05.311
and now you're on trial

04:05.345 --> 04:07.548
for killing your current
business partner.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.083
Even though you were acquitted,
there's a chance

04:10.116 --> 04:12.686
the judge would let
the prosecution ask about it.

04:12.719 --> 04:13.754
Jimmy's right.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.756
We do not want to open the door
on prior bad acts

04:15.789 --> 04:16.990
or pattern evidence.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.426
Look, there is good news.

04:20.459 --> 04:22.663
One of their witnesses,
a man named Charles Rossi,

04:22.696 --> 04:24.264
came to our office last night

04:24.297 --> 04:26.332
and told us
he misidentified you.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.870
Thank God.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.104
Don't get too excited.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.139
The prosecution still has
another witness.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.642
Well, didn't they just
lose half their case?

04:40.747 --> 04:42.516
Michael, we need to ask.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.287
Any idea why this witness
is backing off his ID?

04:49.022 --> 04:53.126
You think I threatened him?
I'm sitting in prison.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.461
As officers of the court,
we can't get involved

04:55.495 --> 04:58.298
in any kind of conspiracy
to threaten a witness.

04:58.331 --> 05:02.335
Look, I hung
with the wrong kind.

05:02.368 --> 05:04.838
I made some big mistakes.

05:04.871 --> 05:07.974
But I haven't been connected
to any of that in years.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.210
Then why would he come to us
instead of the DA?

05:10.243 --> 05:12.513
How do I know?!
I don't know!

05:12.546 --> 05:15.048
For the last time,
I didn't threaten anyone!

05:15.081 --> 05:18.018
Okay.
No, it's not okay.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.555
I need to know that you're gonna
be there fighting for me.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.825
Michael, you hired us
to do a job.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.494
We'll do that job.

05:30.063 --> 05:33.567
I just want to make sure that
you're comfortable with me.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.574
Philly, what happened?

05:41.975 --> 05:44.277
I was walking past
this jewelry store,

05:44.310 --> 05:46.680
and I saw
the most beautiful watch.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.649
I-I couldn't help myself.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.752
You've never done anything
like this.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.587
You scalp tickets.
You run poker games.

05:53.620 --> 05:56.723
I know, I know, but the watch--
it was a Breitling Chrono.

05:57.423 --> 06:00.260
Shiny gold plate, three dials,
the whole deal--

06:00.293 --> 06:01.662
goes for two large.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.264
And you thought you'd just waltz
out of the store with it?

06:04.297 --> 06:05.999
The salesman was busy
with another customer.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.901
I thought I could outrun him.
(coughs)

06:09.269 --> 06:10.904
And what's with
the written statement?

06:10.937 --> 06:13.006
The cops caught me
half a block away

06:13.039 --> 06:14.775
with the watch in my pocket.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.546
Philly, this just
doesn't make sense.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.548
You're not a thief.
I know you.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.784
I got desperate.
I needed the money bad,

06:23.817 --> 06:25.251
so I did something stupid.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.588
Grand larceny--
pretty stupid.

06:30.290 --> 06:33.026
You may not get out of this
without some time.

06:33.827 --> 06:34.828
How much time?

06:34.861 --> 06:36.830
If we go to trial,
more than if we plead,

06:36.863 --> 06:40.100
but I don't mean
just a couple of months
at a corrections house.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.636
We could be talking years
at Walpole.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.404
And at your age
and your condition--

06:44.437 --> 06:46.773
I'll do all right.
You don't worry about me.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.344
Philly, are you okay?
You don't look well.

06:51.377 --> 06:54.114
I'm just-- I'm just scared,
that's all.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.217
Don't worry.
I'll get to work on this.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.889
As you can see, I'm a little
buried at the moment.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.560
Just two minutes--
Philly Sidlow, grand larceny.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.429
Right. Um, we need to talk.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.964
Good, because there's no point
going to trial.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.866
Philly's an older guy,
he's harmless,

07:12.899 --> 07:14.334
all his priors are misdemeanor
ticket scalping.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.570
Lindsay, hold on. Um...

07:16.603 --> 07:18.004
The watch your client lifted--

07:18.038 --> 07:20.306
(sighs) We lost it.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.775
You lost it?

07:21.808 --> 07:22.976
Somewhere between booking

07:23.009 --> 07:24.978
and the evidence room,
it disappeared.

07:25.011 --> 07:28.749
You know, quite frankly, I
would like to check the wrists
of every cop in Boston.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.351
Then you got no case.
Don't tell me a jury
will convict without--

07:31.384 --> 07:34.921
Wait. Lindsay,
your guy confessed.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.323
And I'll argue that he was
suffering from early dementia

07:37.357 --> 07:39.292
and didn't know
what he was confessing to.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.494
Jean, come on.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.063
You've lost the evidence,

07:43.096 --> 07:45.398
and you obviously have
bigger fish to fry.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.433
Please? Favor bank?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.804
I'll owe you.
I'm serious.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.643
All right. I'll plead it
to petty larceny, time served.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.545
He walks now?

07:58.579 --> 08:01.214
Yes, but you do owe me.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.783
I'm serious.

08:05.218 --> 08:08.121
CHARLIE: I was leaving
the school around 8:00.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.857
I'm a custodian at John Adams.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.594
I was walking down Holden
on my way to the bus,

08:13.627 --> 08:16.029
when I saw this guy
coming out of the house.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.564
Did you get
a good look at him?

08:17.598 --> 08:19.132
Yeah, I did.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.201
Do you see the man here
in the courtroom?

08:22.536 --> 08:23.537
No.

08:26.540 --> 08:31.244
Mr. Rossi, is the man you
identified for the police

08:31.277 --> 08:34.815
and the District Attorney
present today in this courtroom?

08:34.847 --> 08:38.351
The guy I identified is sitting
right over there,

08:38.384 --> 08:40.320
but what I'm trying
to tell you is

08:40.352 --> 08:42.655
that's not who I saw
running that night.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.892
Mr. Rossi, did you
or did you not testify

08:45.926 --> 08:49.129
in front of the Grand Jury one
month after Mr. Hayden's murder?

08:49.162 --> 08:51.765
I did.
While in front
of the Grand Jury...

08:53.166 --> 08:55.602
...were these
your truthful responses?

08:55.636 --> 08:58.471
"Question-- 'Is this the man
you saw running

08:58.505 --> 09:00.541
from Mr. Hayden's house?'

09:00.574 --> 09:02.475
Answer-- 'Yes.'

09:02.509 --> 09:04.845
Question-- 'Are you sure?'

09:04.878 --> 09:08.749
Answer-- 'One hundred
percent sure.'"

09:08.782 --> 09:14.154
Now, Mr. Rossi,
were those your responses?

09:14.187 --> 09:16.056
Yes.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.424
Do you remember sitting
in my office two days ago,

09:18.458 --> 09:20.627
discussing this case?
Listen...

09:20.661 --> 09:24.865
I saw Mr. MacIntyre's
photo in the newspaper
yesterday morning,

09:24.898 --> 09:27.433
and he just isn't
who I saw that night.

09:27.467 --> 09:30.637
That night you were five feet
from the suspect

09:30.671 --> 09:32.105
on a well-lit street.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.974
Now you are changing your mind

09:34.007 --> 09:37.578
after seeing a black-and-white
newspaper photo?

09:37.611 --> 09:39.145
Yes.

09:39.179 --> 09:42.415
Did you discuss with anyone
your appearance here today?

09:42.448 --> 09:46.753
I talked to my sister
and Mr. Donnell and Mr. Berluti.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.256
You told defense counsel
but not the prosecution?

09:50.290 --> 09:52.726
Their names were in the paper
along with MacIntyre.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.360
I thought they should know.

09:54.394 --> 09:59.199
Mr. Rossi, were you paid to
change your testimony today?

09:59.232 --> 10:02.268
No.
Were you threatened
into doing so?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.037
No. Why don't you understand?

10:04.070 --> 10:05.972
You people have got
the wrong guy,

10:06.006 --> 10:07.608
and I'm just trying to do
the right thing.

10:07.641 --> 10:10.110
Your Honor, I have nothing
further for this witness.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.212
People reserve
the right to recall.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.881
Very well, then.
We'll reconvene in the morning.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.116
(bangs gavel)

10:24.925 --> 10:26.960
(sighs)

10:26.993 --> 10:28.962
What the hell was that?
HELEN: How do I know?

10:28.995 --> 10:30.997
Two days ago the guy was
completely on board,

10:31.031 --> 10:33.199
but now he's either
confused or scared.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.268
He was reached by MacIntyre,
damn it,

10:35.301 --> 10:37.303
and you couldn't pull him back.

10:37.337 --> 10:40.140
Yesterday we had two witnesses
who could make MacIntyre.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.242
Today one's pissed back on us,

10:42.275 --> 10:44.678
and the other one's in Florida,
for God's sake!

10:46.379 --> 10:49.082
I want you to get
a material-witness warrant

10:49.115 --> 10:51.818
and have the Florida sheriff
pick that woman up now.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.554
I've already threatened her
with that.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.189
She says if we follow through
she won't talk at all.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.791
How bad is her mother?

10:57.824 --> 10:59.760
Day-to-day.
Who knows?

11:01.027 --> 11:03.797
Listen, I know you've
never fully recovered

11:03.830 --> 11:05.699
from the earlier case
where MacIntyre--

11:05.732 --> 11:07.033
Where's Rossi now?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.202
We've still got him.
He's outside.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.005
Get him in here.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.142
They lost the watch?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.178
Somebody at the police station
must have cuffed it.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.313
Then, what-- I'm looking
at a couple of months?

11:20.346 --> 11:25.185
Philly, they pled it down
to a misdemeanor.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.187
You don't have to serve
any time.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.523
But I copped to it.
I confessed.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.124
You're not understanding me.

11:31.157 --> 11:34.995
Once the plea is entered,
the case is over.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.031
I was just--

11:38.064 --> 11:41.502
(exhales) This-- this
threw me for a loop is all.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.370
Here I was--
I was thinking "Walpole,"

11:44.404 --> 11:47.140
and you gave me a second life.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.342
I appreciate you
getting me kicked.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.044
You dodged a bullet.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.947
Stay away from this kind
of thing, okay?

11:53.980 --> 11:55.381
Yeah, yeah.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.620
What are you talking about?
Why would I need a lawyer?

11:59.653 --> 12:03.724
Perjury carries a maximum
sentence of 20 years, Mr. Rossi.

12:03.757 --> 12:07.027
What perjury?
I made a mistake, that's all.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.129
We don't think so.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.164
Are you going to arrest me?

12:11.197 --> 12:12.498
'Cause if you're not,
I'm leaving.

12:12.533 --> 12:13.767
Sit down.

12:13.800 --> 12:14.735
I don't have to stay
if you're not gonna--

12:14.768 --> 12:16.036
Sit down and shut up.

12:24.545 --> 12:26.079
You think you're smarter
than me.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.281
Prisons are full of guys

12:28.314 --> 12:30.651
who thought
they were smarter than me.

12:30.684 --> 12:32.719
I'm the chief prosecutor
for the DA,

12:32.753 --> 12:36.456
and that means I have
the authority to do
whatever I want.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.026
You just screwed me over
in this case,

12:40.060 --> 12:41.695
and if MacIntyre walks
because of it,

12:41.728 --> 12:44.197
I'm gonna take that
very personally.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.866
And here's what'll happen--

12:45.899 --> 12:49.369
first, I'll open
a grand jury investigation,

12:49.402 --> 12:52.372
and I'll subpoena everyone
who hates your guts.

12:52.405 --> 12:56.510
And when I'm through with them,
you will be indicted for perjury

12:56.543 --> 12:58.411
and obstruction of justice.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.380
Then I'm gonna convict
your ass

13:00.413 --> 13:04.050
and personally recommend
the maximum sentence be doubled.

13:04.084 --> 13:08.188
And off you'll go to the
toughest prison in the state,

13:08.221 --> 13:11.592
where I'll see to it
that you're thrown
into the general population

13:11.625 --> 13:13.760
for the length of your term.

13:15.529 --> 13:19.032
Whatever weight you're feeling
from the other side,

13:19.065 --> 13:22.335
it's nothing compared to
the load I'm going to bring.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.641
Mr. Rossi...

13:31.277 --> 13:33.980
Okay. Well...

13:36.416 --> 13:37.818
Let me think about it.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.686
You have seven hours.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.988
If you need protection,
we'll give it to you.

13:42.022 --> 13:45.959
And I'm sure you'll do--
how did you put it--

13:45.992 --> 13:47.227
the right thing?

13:47.260 --> 13:48.795
Yeah.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.164
Can I go now?

13:51.197 --> 13:52.298
Sure.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.009
Hope this works.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.845
It better.

14:18.992 --> 14:19.960
How you doing?

14:19.993 --> 14:23.096
I'm missing a three-hour
lecture on Chaucer.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.899
The Wife of Bath's tale
is the best.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.701
It's the bawdiest one.

14:30.671 --> 14:32.272
You're gonna do great
up there.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.809
I know it didn't go well
yesterday, but...

14:37.711 --> 14:39.179
...I'm ready to testify,
Ms. Gamble.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.747
I'm really ready.

14:40.781 --> 14:41.948
I know.

14:48.789 --> 14:52.593
Mr. MacIntyre was my dad's
business partner.

14:52.626 --> 14:55.996
They owned three body shops
together for almost five years.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.298
How would you characterize
their relationship?

14:58.331 --> 15:03.169
It started off fine,
but just before my dad
was killed,

15:03.203 --> 15:05.405
he told me that--
Objection-- hearsay.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.940
Sustained.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.843
Patricia, did you
ever overhear

15:09.876 --> 15:11.645
the defendant
threaten your father?

15:11.678 --> 15:15.148
Yes. Two days
before he was killed.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.851
I came home early from school.

15:17.884 --> 15:20.921
I went into the kitchen
through the back door.

15:20.954 --> 15:24.124
My father and Mr. MacIntyre
were in the next room arguing.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.659
Was it a violent fight?

15:25.692 --> 15:28.361
Yes. There was a lot
of screaming.

15:28.394 --> 15:29.763
I didn't hear everything,

15:29.796 --> 15:33.299
but my father was accusing
Mr. MacIntyre of stealing money

15:33.333 --> 15:35.268
and doctoring the books.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.103
He said he was going to sue.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.772
What did the defendant say?

15:39.640 --> 15:41.675
He was really mad.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.610
He told my dad that he
could go ahead and sue

15:43.644 --> 15:45.612
but that he wouldn't live
to see it through,

15:45.646 --> 15:47.280
that he'd kill him first.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.083
Ms. Hayden,
tell us what happened

15:50.116 --> 15:52.152
the night
your father was killed.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.154
I came home late.

15:56.022 --> 15:59.760
I went inside and
found my father lying
on the kitchen floor.

16:00.594 --> 16:03.163
There was blood everywhere.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.733
And he was-- he was gulping
for air, trying to breathe.

16:08.434 --> 16:13.540
By the time the EMTs arrived,
it was too late.

16:16.877 --> 16:20.280
You say your father thought
my client was stealing
from his business.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.815
Did he go to the police?

16:21.848 --> 16:24.785
My father always gave people
the benefit of the doubt.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.487
He had no proof
Mr. MacIntyre was stealing.

16:27.521 --> 16:30.557
So it's possible there was no
theft on my client's part?

16:30.591 --> 16:32.593
I only know
what I heard that night.

16:32.626 --> 16:35.261
And you say Mr. MacIntyre
threatened your father's life.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.330
You believed that was a serious
threat, didn't you?

16:37.363 --> 16:38.498
Yes.

16:38.532 --> 16:40.133
Why didn't you report this

16:40.166 --> 16:42.035
serious threat to the police?

16:42.068 --> 16:43.704
My father said
he wasn't afraid.

16:43.737 --> 16:45.839
In fact, you only reported
this argument

16:45.872 --> 16:48.141
weeks after your father died.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.176
At first the police told me

16:50.210 --> 16:52.412
my father was the victim
of an intruder.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.915
But I didn't believe it.

16:54.948 --> 16:57.417
Why not? Your house
has been burglarized twice

16:57.450 --> 16:58.952
in the last three years,
isn't that correct?

16:58.985 --> 17:00.521
Yes, but--

17:00.554 --> 17:02.288
And six weeks
before your father died,

17:02.322 --> 17:04.925
you called the police to report
someone looking in your window.

17:04.958 --> 17:06.760
Isn't that correct?
My father wasn't--

17:06.792 --> 17:10.030
The police felt your father was
killed confronting a burglar

17:10.063 --> 17:11.998
until you convinced them
otherwise.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.733
It wasn't a burglar.

17:14.800 --> 17:18.204
Ms. Hayden...
I feel for your loss,

17:18.238 --> 17:22.542
but isn't it possible that
you're wrong about my client?

17:22.576 --> 17:23.676
No.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.411
There is no direct evidence

17:25.444 --> 17:28.414
linking Mr. MacIntyre
to your father's death.

17:28.448 --> 17:31.985
One witness even recanted,
admitting he made a mistake.

17:33.486 --> 17:36.489
Isn't it possible
you made one, too?

17:47.701 --> 17:48.935
(door opens)

17:51.605 --> 17:52.773
Philly...

17:52.806 --> 17:54.775
Listen, I--
I got jammed up again.

17:54.808 --> 17:58.178
I'm really busy.
I held up a convenience store.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.849
Lucy, will you get the
Vorenbergs some coffee,
maybe something to eat?

18:02.883 --> 18:05.919
That'll go over big since you
were 40 minutes late starting.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.187
Just stall.

18:11.625 --> 18:14.260
Philly, what's going on?

18:14.294 --> 18:15.495
What's with you?

18:15.529 --> 18:17.564
I told you, I need money.
I'm desperate.

18:17.598 --> 18:19.299
That wasn't just going away.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.801
(sighs)

18:20.834 --> 18:24.470
You held up a store.
Did anyone get hurt?

18:24.505 --> 18:27.908
No. I could go
to the federal pen
for this, right?

18:27.941 --> 18:30.476
No, this is a state crime.
What's the difference?

18:30.511 --> 18:33.847
To get sent to federal prison,
you have to commit a federal
crime, like robbing a bank.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.182
Look-- forget that.
But how much time
am I looking at?

18:36.216 --> 18:38.919
Did you use a gun?
It depends.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.787
What?
Yeah, okay, I used a gun.

18:40.821 --> 18:42.856
When did you do this,
last night?

18:42.889 --> 18:44.124
Does it make a difference?

18:45.391 --> 18:47.761
Philly, you're not making
any sense.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.930
Lindsay, please,
just help me out here.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.466
Look, if you're in trouble
or you need money,

18:53.499 --> 18:54.968
maybe I can help,

18:55.001 --> 18:58.004
but only if you tell me
what's really going on.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.340
(door opens)

19:00.373 --> 19:01.675
I'm losing the Vorenbergs.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.010
Should I move on to card tricks
or balloon animals?

19:04.044 --> 19:05.512
I'll be right there.

19:05.546 --> 19:06.913
I need to think about this.

19:06.947 --> 19:08.982
W-Where are you--
I gotta go.

19:12.586 --> 19:13.654
Philly!

19:13.687 --> 19:15.922
(door opens, shuts)

19:21.562 --> 19:23.463
(sirens wailing)

19:23.496 --> 19:24.865
(indistinct chatter)

19:32.338 --> 19:34.741
I had a uniformed officer
waiting at his place all day,

19:34.775 --> 19:36.843
but he never showed.

19:36.877 --> 19:38.545
Then we got this call.

19:40.581 --> 19:41.882
Shot once in the neck.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.352
Probably bled out
in only a few minutes.
Witnesses?

19:46.386 --> 19:48.254
We're canvassing,
but in a neighborhood like this,

19:48.288 --> 19:50.924
nobody sees anything.
Any leads at all?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.560
His wallet's missing.

19:53.594 --> 19:54.795
Thanks.

20:01.502 --> 20:03.504
MacIntyre did this, Helen.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.240
I should have convicted
the bastard 12 years ago.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.676
He wouldn't still be running
around killing people.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.080
Tomorrow I'll talk
to the judge.

20:14.114 --> 20:15.315
I'll be with you.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.517
It's not a good idea.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.018
You and Wilcox have a history.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.753
I don't need you
bringing baggage in there.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.955
What I'll bring is the full
weight of this office.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.024
The judge has to respect that.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.126
I can handle it.
I don't need your help.

20:26.159 --> 20:29.029
I'll be with you, Helen.
End of story.

20:40.206 --> 20:43.376
So, Rossi got himself shot.
Isn't that too bad.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.512
Do you know anything
about this?

20:45.546 --> 20:46.847
Of course not.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.782
You're not too broken up
about it.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.984
What, I'm supposed to
feel bad?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.819
This is the guy that
caused me all my trouble.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.656
So, what now?

20:55.689 --> 20:56.857
We're thinking
this might be the time

20:56.890 --> 20:58.559
to reopen
plea negotiations.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.093
Why?

21:00.126 --> 21:02.362
Aren't my chances better
now than they were before?

21:02.395 --> 21:06.099
Yes, but there's always the risk
they find new evidence,

21:06.132 --> 21:08.001
and the prosecution still
has another witness--

21:08.034 --> 21:09.736
a woman who also says
she saw you

21:09.770 --> 21:11.371
coming out of Hayden's house
that night.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.707
I still like my chances.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.742
Now more than ever.

21:15.776 --> 21:18.178
I didn't kill Rossi,
I didn't kill Hayden.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.147
And I'm not pleading
to anything.

21:22.783 --> 21:25.485
Your Honor, I move that you
declare a mistrial

21:25.519 --> 21:28.088
based on manifest necessity
for a new trial.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.991
You can't retry my client
just because your case
is falling apart.

21:31.024 --> 21:34.895
If, in fact,
a witness is threatened or
killed by the defendant,

21:34.928 --> 21:38.565
I can declare a mistrial based
on manifest necessity,

21:38.599 --> 21:40.834
and there would be no violation
of double jeopardy.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.468
We would start
a new trial.

21:42.503 --> 21:44.571
My client was
in custody last night.

21:44.605 --> 21:46.339
Your client has extensive
criminal connections.

21:46.372 --> 21:47.874
Old news
and circumstantial.

21:47.908 --> 21:49.342
MacIntyre could have easily
had someone

21:49.375 --> 21:50.611
pull the trigger for him.

21:50.644 --> 21:52.345
That doesn't make
any sense.

21:52.378 --> 21:55.081
Mr. Rossi just testified
in my client's favor.

21:55.115 --> 21:57.951
Ms. Gamble and I talked
with Rossi after he testified.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.620
We believe he intended
to reverse direction

21:59.653 --> 22:01.522
and implicate
the defendant.

22:01.555 --> 22:04.324
Well, to be fair, he didn't
explicitly say that.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.159
I think he did.

22:06.192 --> 22:08.261
The defendant was trying
to lock in his testimony.

22:10.030 --> 22:13.399
Mr. Walsh, I am very troubled
by the death of this witness.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.502
But at this point, you've shown
me no evidence

22:15.536 --> 22:17.470
tying the defendant
to the murder.

22:17.504 --> 22:20.340
Even if I grant your request
for a mistrial,

22:20.373 --> 22:23.343
I'm afraid it won't
stand up on appeal.

22:23.376 --> 22:24.811
Do you have any other
witnesses?

22:24.845 --> 22:27.881
At this point, we intend to call
the investigating officer,

22:27.914 --> 22:29.883
and then we hope to call
another witness

22:29.916 --> 22:32.052
who saw the defendant
running from the crime scene.

22:34.287 --> 22:36.623
Very well.
The case will proceed.

22:43.564 --> 22:45.799
(sighs)

22:49.302 --> 22:50.737
You tied my hands in there.

22:50.771 --> 22:52.405
If you hadn't lied
about the witness--

22:52.438 --> 22:54.007
I didn't lie.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.842
Look, now I can't even try
for a continuance

22:55.876 --> 22:57.377
to get her back here.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.879
Wilcox wouldn't give
you one anyway.

23:02.148 --> 23:03.917
I'm taking over
first chair.

23:04.918 --> 23:07.253
Excuse me?!

23:08.789 --> 23:11.257
You're losing, Helen.
I'm coming in.

23:11.291 --> 23:13.459
You pulling rank
on me now?
Yes.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.796
I'm not gonna let this guy
get away twice.

23:16.997 --> 23:19.165
Now, I'm gonna prep
the investigating officer.

23:19.199 --> 23:21.001
I've done that
three times.

23:21.034 --> 23:22.536
But I'm taking him
on direct now...

23:22.569 --> 23:24.070
so I need to prep him.

23:24.104 --> 23:27.073
And I'd like to speak
with him...alone.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.311
(starts elevator)

23:37.483 --> 23:38.852
It says that in Hong Kong,

23:38.885 --> 23:40.854
a betrayed wife
is legally allowed

23:40.887 --> 23:42.355
to kill her adulterous
husband,

23:42.388 --> 23:44.024
but only with
her bare hands.

23:44.057 --> 23:47.093
Lucy, I'm gonna use my bare
hands if you don't stop talking.

23:47.728 --> 23:49.362
Has Philly Sidlow
called back?

23:49.395 --> 23:50.731
He doesn't know
to call back.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.132
He doesn't have
an answering machine.

23:52.165 --> 23:53.199
I can't leave
a message.

23:53.233 --> 23:54.668
Keep calling
until you reach him.

23:54.701 --> 23:56.436
I just called
ten minutes ago.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.304
(phone ringing)

23:58.338 --> 23:59.606
Okay.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.875
Lindsay, I've been going over
Ned Zeman's deposition--

24:01.908 --> 24:03.243
Eugene, can we
go over this later?

24:03.276 --> 24:04.945
I've got a million and one
things to do.

24:04.978 --> 24:06.412
Lindsay. Lindsay.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.148
It's him.
Him who?

24:08.181 --> 24:09.215
Sidlow.

24:12.152 --> 24:13.286
Philly,
where have you--

24:14.454 --> 24:16.523
What?
Okay, stop talking.

24:16.557 --> 24:18.992
That's right, do not say a word
to anybody until I get there.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.326
Yes, I'll be right there.

24:21.394 --> 24:23.029
How would you like to go over
the Zeman deposition

24:23.063 --> 24:24.064
on the way to booking?

24:24.097 --> 24:25.331
(sighs)

24:27.634 --> 24:29.536
I didn't mean for anyone
to get hurt.

24:29.570 --> 24:32.005
You gotta believe me.
Philly--

24:32.038 --> 24:33.774
You gotta tell 'em, Lindsay.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.909
This is very serious.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.243
I asked Eugene
to come with me.

24:37.277 --> 24:38.545
You don't have to say
it's serious.

24:38.579 --> 24:40.213
The cops already told me
I could get life!

24:40.246 --> 24:42.015
Please...

24:42.048 --> 24:43.984
Let's go over
what happened.

24:45.519 --> 24:47.153
I robbed a bank,
like Lindsay said to.

24:48.388 --> 24:49.355
Philly!

24:49.389 --> 24:51.457
I never said,
"rob a bank."

24:51.491 --> 24:53.259
What are you talking about?
You did!

24:53.293 --> 24:55.495
You even said that I could go
to federal prison if I did.

24:55.529 --> 24:57.263
I wasn't advising you
to commit a crime!

24:57.297 --> 24:59.533
All right, hold on.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.735
I need to know exactly
what's going on.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.169
(sighs)

25:04.304 --> 25:07.273
I've been sick.
Lindsay knows.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.711
I thought it was
in remission.

25:10.744 --> 25:13.213
Nah. The prostate--
it's spreading.

25:13.246 --> 25:15.148
I got this blood disease.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.883
I need these transfusions
all the time.

25:18.519 --> 25:19.753
Where are you being
treated?

25:19.786 --> 25:22.122
(scoffs) See, that's
the thing. I'm not.

25:22.155 --> 25:23.524
I got no health insurance.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.693
So unless I'm just
about to kick,

25:26.727 --> 25:28.094
I gotta wait.

25:28.128 --> 25:30.864
So you tried robbing a bank
to pay for an operation?

25:30.897 --> 25:32.365
Even if I could get the money,

25:32.398 --> 25:35.068
they'd still make me
wait months!

25:35.101 --> 25:36.770
But in federal prison,
the doctors--

25:36.803 --> 25:38.805
they have to work on you
right away.

25:39.940 --> 25:42.242
Danny Small,
from Brockton-- big hernia.

25:42.275 --> 25:44.244
They sent him away
for check kiting,

25:44.277 --> 25:46.513
and he was put under
the knife that day!

25:47.748 --> 25:50.150
You've been trying
to get arrested?

25:51.117 --> 25:53.554
I got no money,
no family.

25:53.587 --> 25:55.622
Only a one-room hole
in Somerville.

25:55.656 --> 25:57.223
They're tossing me out
up at month's end.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.426
And the pain
from this cancer...

26:02.829 --> 26:04.598
It was the only way.

26:05.699 --> 26:09.169
Okay... what happened today?

26:11.237 --> 26:13.874
I went to the bank
down the street.

26:13.907 --> 26:17.277
I gave the teller a note asking
her to hand over 300 bucks.

26:17.310 --> 26:18.879
That's all.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.715
But while she was putting
the money in the bag,

26:21.748 --> 26:23.584
this guard started
walking toward me.

26:23.617 --> 26:26.520
Did you have a gun?
No.

26:26.553 --> 26:29.890
(sighs deeply)
But the teller--

26:29.923 --> 26:32.659
She tried sticking one of those
dye packs in the bag--

26:32.693 --> 26:34.728
the kind that explode.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.362
Anyway, it must have gone off,

26:36.396 --> 26:37.731
and the guard must have
thought that--

26:38.665 --> 26:41.367
He pulled his gun
and fired.

26:41.401 --> 26:43.737
He hit the lady
standing behind me.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.405
What happened to her?

26:45.438 --> 26:47.040
I don't know.

26:49.309 --> 26:50.977
This could be
felony murder.

26:51.011 --> 26:52.412
But I didn't kill anybody!

26:52.445 --> 26:54.080
I told you
I didn't even have a gun!

26:54.114 --> 26:56.316
Doesn't matter.
If the woman's dead,

26:56.349 --> 26:58.218
it happened during
the commission of a crime.

26:59.653 --> 27:01.855
I didn't want anybody
to get killed!

27:01.888 --> 27:03.323
I didn't. I--

27:04.658 --> 27:07.027
(voice breaking)
I just wanted an operation.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.128
That's all.

27:08.161 --> 27:09.596
(crying) I mean--

27:09.630 --> 27:12.432
I didn't-- I--
(crying)

27:18.171 --> 27:20.373
Detective Simons...

27:20.406 --> 27:21.775
on the night Mr. Hayden
was murdered,

27:21.808 --> 27:23.343
was his house
burglarized?

27:23.376 --> 27:24.778
No.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.813
How can you be sure?

27:26.847 --> 27:29.349
For one,
there were valuables--

27:29.382 --> 27:31.718
jewelry, watches, money--

27:31.752 --> 27:33.820
in plain sight
and left untouched.

27:33.854 --> 27:37.357
Additionally, because of the way
that Mr. Hayden was killed.

27:37.390 --> 27:39.893
He was shot behind both knees
about 30 minutes before

27:39.926 --> 27:41.595
he was shot
in the back of the head.

27:41.628 --> 27:43.129
Why is that significant?

27:43.163 --> 27:44.965
Burglars like to get in,

27:44.998 --> 27:46.667
grab what they can,
and get out.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.002
Whoever killed Mr. Hayden

27:49.035 --> 27:51.204
stuck around to watch him die.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.806
This was personal.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.307
Objection.
Sustained.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.377
Only testify as to what
you observed, Detective.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.813
What other evidence
connects Mr. MacIntyre

27:59.846 --> 28:01.582
to Mr. Hayden's murder?

28:01.615 --> 28:03.884
The fact that Mr. MacIntyre
was tried for killing

28:03.917 --> 28:05.285
his former business
partner.

28:05.318 --> 28:07.554
Objection!
JUDGE: Sustained.

28:07.588 --> 28:10.924
I am instructing the jury
to absolutely disregard

28:10.957 --> 28:12.626
the last statement made
by the witness.

28:12.659 --> 28:14.695
Let me be clear--

28:14.728 --> 28:17.631
what he said was inadmissible,
inappropriate,

28:17.664 --> 28:19.866
and wholly irrelevant
to this case.

28:20.901 --> 28:22.402
You must not refer
to it in any way

28:22.435 --> 28:24.337
during the course
of your deliberations

28:24.370 --> 28:26.006
or in reaching a verdict.

28:26.039 --> 28:28.208
Counsel-- chambers.

28:31.912 --> 28:35.281
Explain to me right now
why I shouldn't declare
a mistrial.

28:35.315 --> 28:37.317
Your Honor, I had no idea
Detective Simons

28:37.350 --> 28:39.352
would bring up
Mr. MacIntyre's record.

28:39.385 --> 28:42.155
Who are you kidding?
This isn't even open
for debate.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.891
My client's entitled
to an immediate mistrial
with prejudice.

28:44.925 --> 28:48.061
He just instructed
the jury to ignore
the detective's comment.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.763
The jury will never forget
what they heard.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.932
There's no way our client
will get a fair trial.

28:51.965 --> 28:54.568
I disagree.
Of course you do.

28:54.601 --> 28:56.737
You did this
intentionally.

28:56.770 --> 28:58.639
You conspired
with the detective.

28:58.672 --> 29:00.440
That's completely untrue!

29:00.473 --> 29:02.108
Your case
was in the toilet.

29:02.142 --> 29:03.977
You wanted to restart
the trial.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.212
If you called for a mistrial,
you wouldn't get a new trial

29:06.246 --> 29:08.148
because double jeopardy
would attach!

29:08.181 --> 29:09.783
So you forced me to call
for one,

29:09.816 --> 29:12.018
knowing double jeopardy
would not attach.

29:12.052 --> 29:13.386
That's a lie, Your Honor.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.721
You have to dismiss
with prejudice.

29:14.755 --> 29:16.089
You at least need
to hold a hearing.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.925
I have the right to
question Walsh under oath.

29:18.959 --> 29:20.861
Let me save you the trouble.

29:21.662 --> 29:22.929
My question was innocent.

29:22.963 --> 29:24.598
The detective made
an error.

29:24.631 --> 29:26.667
I specifically instructed him
not to refer

29:26.700 --> 29:28.201
to MacIntyre's priors.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.470
In no way did I
conspire with him.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.779
Then I want to put
Helen Gamble on the stand.
Bobby--

29:38.812 --> 29:40.514
There's no allegation
of misconduct

29:40.547 --> 29:42.015
against Ms. Gamble.
The fact that--

29:42.048 --> 29:44.217
Your Honor,
Mr. Donnell would prefer

29:44.250 --> 29:47.087
a murderer walk
on a technicality.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.355
I'm sure you don't want to
be the one to grant that wish.

29:49.389 --> 29:51.992
Oh, don't lay this
at my doorstep.

29:52.025 --> 29:53.927
I'm appealing to your
sense of justice.

29:55.195 --> 29:57.898
When Mr. MacIntyre killed
Mr. Rossi last night,

29:57.931 --> 29:59.766
he spit on your court.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.440
When we go back out...

30:07.473 --> 30:10.577
I will excuse the jury
and clear the room.

30:10.611 --> 30:12.979
Then Ms. Gamble
will take the stand.

30:24.558 --> 30:26.126
As I've already stated,

30:26.159 --> 30:29.896
I have no proof that Mr. Walsh
intended to cause a mistrial.

30:29.930 --> 30:31.965
Did he ever discuss
getting a mistrial

30:31.998 --> 30:34.535
so he could restart
with a new trial?

30:34.568 --> 30:37.003
We never discussed
anything like that.

30:37.738 --> 30:40.273
I really don't think I can
help you here, Your Honor.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.543
Whatever we discussed
is work product.

30:42.576 --> 30:45.211
Ms. Gamble...
in your opinion,

30:45.245 --> 30:48.615
did Mr. Walsh intend
to cause a mistrial?

30:48.649 --> 30:51.051
Your Honor,
I strongly object.

30:51.084 --> 30:52.586
My colleague has already stated

30:52.619 --> 30:54.555
her opinion is completely
irrelevant

30:54.588 --> 30:56.122
and inadmissible
work product.

30:56.156 --> 30:57.624
Relax, Mr. Walsh.

30:57.658 --> 31:00.260
You're not on trial.
There's no jury here.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.895
This is a hearing,
and I would like to listen

31:01.928 --> 31:03.263
to what Ms. Gamble
has to say.

31:03.296 --> 31:06.733
Then, in principle,
I object to forcing DAs

31:06.767 --> 31:08.501
to testify in this manner.

31:08.535 --> 31:09.670
Already noted.

31:11.505 --> 31:13.006
Ms. Gamble.

31:13.039 --> 31:16.376
Your Honor, it seems the issue
does go to my opinion.

31:16.409 --> 31:17.878
Then I'll rephrase
the question.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.247
Do you have any basis
to believe

31:21.281 --> 31:24.818
Mr. Walsh did intend
to cause a mistrial?

31:26.119 --> 31:27.387
(sighs)

31:28.589 --> 31:30.223
Yes.
Your Honor!

31:30.256 --> 31:32.626
Sit down, Mr. Walsh.

31:34.828 --> 31:37.564
Please explain why
you believe this.

31:37.598 --> 31:40.767
We're having a problem
with our other witness.

31:40.801 --> 31:44.470
She's in Florida, tending
to her hospitalized mother.

31:44.505 --> 31:46.139
It was becoming clear

31:46.172 --> 31:49.209
she probably wouldn't make it
back in time to testify.

31:49.943 --> 31:51.377
On top of that,

31:51.411 --> 31:53.680
Mr. Walsh made sure
to exclude me

31:53.714 --> 31:55.649
when he prepped
Detective Simons.

31:55.682 --> 31:58.652
He may have been colluding
with him at that point.

32:00.220 --> 32:02.589
I also believe Mr. Walsh
has not been candid.

32:03.990 --> 32:06.660
For example,
he suggested that Mr. Rossi

32:06.693 --> 32:09.095
intended to implicate
MacIntyre again,

32:09.129 --> 32:13.567
when, in fact, he's given us
no indication either way.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.469
Your Honor,
I insist I be allowed

32:16.503 --> 32:18.138
to cross-examine Ms. Gamble.

32:20.140 --> 32:21.307
Your witness.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.979
Isn't it true
that the witness

32:26.012 --> 32:27.948
could have made it
back from Florida

32:27.981 --> 32:29.115
in time to testify?

32:29.149 --> 32:31.317
Possible, but unlikely.

32:31.351 --> 32:34.621
And isn't it also true
that we could have asked
for a continuance?

32:34.655 --> 32:37.591
Could have asked,
but when I raised
that possibility,

32:37.624 --> 32:39.159
you rejected it.

32:40.193 --> 32:42.495
Do you have any evidence
whatsoever

32:42.529 --> 32:44.330
that I discussed
anything illegal

32:44.364 --> 32:45.932
with Detective Simons?

32:45.966 --> 32:47.768
No, I don't.

32:47.801 --> 32:50.270
And you have no direct evidence
as to what I was thinking?

32:50.303 --> 32:51.605
No.

32:51.638 --> 32:55.441
If you believed I was
committing misconduct,

32:55.475 --> 32:58.779
wasn't it your duty,
as an officer of the court,
to report me?

32:58.812 --> 33:00.681
Maybe I should have.

33:00.714 --> 33:03.784
Well, there are just
two possibilities--

33:03.817 --> 33:05.619
Either you are complicit
in a conspiracy

33:05.652 --> 33:07.588
to commit obstruction
of justice...

33:08.589 --> 33:10.056
...or you are wrong.

33:11.424 --> 33:14.628
I wasn't complicit
in a conspiracy.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.331
But I had concerns.

33:20.934 --> 33:22.168
I've heard enough.

33:22.202 --> 33:23.469
This is still my witness,
Your Honor.

33:23.504 --> 33:25.639
We will take a short recess,

33:25.672 --> 33:27.541
after which,
I'll deliver my decision.

33:35.549 --> 33:37.651
Jean Ward
for the Commonwealth.

33:37.684 --> 33:39.052
Lindsay Dole
for the defense,

33:39.085 --> 33:40.621
waive reading,
plead not guilty.

33:40.654 --> 33:42.022
JUDGE: Question of bail.

33:42.055 --> 33:43.824
Before addressing that,
Your Honor,

33:43.857 --> 33:46.192
the Commonwealth moves
to disqualify Ms. Dole.

33:46.226 --> 33:48.662
She is a material witness
about the crime in question.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.831
What witness?
I'm his lawyer.

33:50.864 --> 33:53.366
A conversation Ms. Dole
had with the defendant
will establish motive.

33:53.399 --> 33:56.637
Your Honor, Eugene Young,
also for the defense.

33:56.670 --> 33:59.706
My colleague cannot testify
where privilege applies.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.775
According to Mr.
Sidlow's statement,

34:01.808 --> 34:02.776
Ms. Dole instructed him

34:02.809 --> 34:04.578
on what kind of crime
to commit

34:04.611 --> 34:06.212
in order to get himself
incarcerated.

34:06.246 --> 34:08.447
That's a lie.
Take it easy.

34:09.081 --> 34:10.050
Counsel, approach.

34:17.690 --> 34:19.793
Ms. Dole, did you instruct
your client

34:19.826 --> 34:21.795
to rob a bank
so he could go to prison?

34:21.828 --> 34:25.031
Again, I raise the issue
of attorney client privilege.

34:25.065 --> 34:27.900
Mr. Sidlow waived that right
when he disclosed the contents

34:27.934 --> 34:29.636
of his conversation
with Ms. Dole.

34:31.071 --> 34:33.774
Now, please answer
the question.

34:35.208 --> 34:37.143
(sighs)

34:37.177 --> 34:40.280
I did explain the difference
between federal and
state crimes,

34:40.313 --> 34:42.148
But only to answer
a client's question

34:42.181 --> 34:44.818
about what he said
was a past crime.

34:44.851 --> 34:46.553
You helped
get a woman killed.

34:48.054 --> 34:50.356
The woman who was shot--

34:50.389 --> 34:52.726
she died an hour ago.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.161
That was not
my fault.

34:56.196 --> 34:58.064
Ms. Dole, it sounds like
Ms. Ward's right.

34:58.098 --> 35:00.300
You probably have to
disqualify yourself.

35:00.333 --> 35:02.903
I will not testify
against my client.

35:02.936 --> 35:04.404
Okay. Enough.

35:04.437 --> 35:07.941
Ms. Ward, although I don't know
exactly what happened here,

35:07.974 --> 35:10.410
let's be realistic--
this shouldn't go
to trial.

35:10.443 --> 35:13.446
The defendant's confused.
He was unarmed.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.849
Felony murder applies
only if the jury finds

35:15.882 --> 35:19.786
that he consciously disregarded
risk to human life.

35:19.820 --> 35:21.454
Therefore,
I strongly suggest

35:21.487 --> 35:25.291
you get Mr. Sidlow
new counsel and settle this.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.061
He wants to go to jail
anyway.

35:32.365 --> 35:35.001
You're quitting on me?
But you're my lawyer.

35:35.035 --> 35:37.037
Philly, the judge
disqualified me.

35:37.070 --> 35:38.338
I'm not quitting.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.474
Look... you aren't listening,

35:41.508 --> 35:43.810
you haven't been listening.

35:43.844 --> 35:45.812
I never told you
to rob a bank.

35:45.846 --> 35:48.882
You did that on your own
and got me in trouble
in the process.

35:51.151 --> 35:52.218
I'm sorry, Lindsay.

35:53.654 --> 35:55.789
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth,

35:55.822 --> 35:57.490
and give me the chance
to help?

35:57.524 --> 36:01.728
I didn't want to get you
mixed up in something illegal.

36:01.762 --> 36:03.096
You're a good person.

36:03.129 --> 36:06.700
(sighs) look, there's nothing
I can do for you now.

36:06.733 --> 36:08.034
I'm not your lawyer.

36:08.068 --> 36:09.736
(sighs)

36:09.770 --> 36:12.172
We shouldn't even be talking,
since privilege doesn't apply.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.408
I was just trying
to save my life.

36:15.441 --> 36:17.177
I didn't want to get
anyone killed.

36:17.210 --> 36:18.545
I know, Philly.

36:25.986 --> 36:26.953
I should go.

36:29.189 --> 36:30.190
Lindsay, wait.

36:31.958 --> 36:34.728
I know we can't talk
about the case, but...

36:41.568 --> 36:43.970
I'll just sit here for a while
and keep you company.

36:44.004 --> 36:45.471
(sighs)

36:45.506 --> 36:46.540
That'd be good.

36:56.617 --> 36:57.784
BAILIFF: All rise.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.489
Be seated.

37:08.328 --> 37:11.832
To dismiss a murder case
with prejudice...

37:11.865 --> 37:13.700
to let a possible killer go free

37:13.734 --> 37:16.737
merely because
of prosecution error

37:16.770 --> 37:19.840
is not only the most extreme
and frowned-upon remedy

37:19.873 --> 37:24.244
available to a court,
it offends our sense
of right and wrong.

37:25.245 --> 37:28.982
It makes a mockery of our most
basic sense of fairness.

37:29.015 --> 37:33.419
Don't misunderstand me,
prosecutorial misconduct
is a problem.

37:33.453 --> 37:38.559
But to deny justice
in order to save justice

37:38.592 --> 37:39.860
makes no sense.

37:41.161 --> 37:42.629
And as the record clearly shows,

37:42.663 --> 37:44.798
I have no smoking gun here--

37:44.831 --> 37:46.900
no direct evidence
that Mr. Walsh

37:46.933 --> 37:50.704
did knowingly and intentionally
cause a mistrial.

37:50.737 --> 37:53.473
The most Ms. Gamble
could offer me was her opinion.

37:53.507 --> 37:57.110
I won't make a ruling
on such an important matter

37:57.143 --> 37:58.812
purely on speculation.

38:01.047 --> 38:04.317
However...
I am required to consider

38:04.350 --> 38:07.588
the totality of the facts
supporting these allegations,

38:07.621 --> 38:10.691
as well as the credibility
of the parties involved.

38:12.392 --> 38:15.261
This is not the first time
I've had Mr. Walsh before me.

38:16.229 --> 38:17.864
This year alone,
I have seen a man

38:17.898 --> 38:21.968
I have always respected
employ what I consider to be

38:22.002 --> 38:23.837
sharp and unethical practices.

38:25.071 --> 38:28.274
He has become increasingly
less candid and honest.

38:29.209 --> 38:33.179
In his effort to do justice,
he has perverted it.

38:33.213 --> 38:35.281
Here he misled the court
about the availability

38:35.315 --> 38:37.818
of a witness I now learn
is in Florida.

38:39.119 --> 38:40.887
It has to stop.

38:42.355 --> 38:45.992
I, therefore,
sadly have no choice

38:46.026 --> 38:49.062
but to find that Mr. Walsh
did intend to cause a mistrial

38:49.095 --> 38:51.131
in an effort to obtain
a new trial.

38:52.699 --> 38:55.936
The case against the defendant
is dismissed with prejudice.

38:57.070 --> 39:00.273
Mr. MacIntyre...
you are free to go.

39:01.307 --> 39:03.877
Your Honor...
may I be heard?

39:03.910 --> 39:05.345
I have ruled, Mr. Walsh.

39:05.378 --> 39:06.947
Then for the record,

39:06.980 --> 39:10.016
let me say we are filing
an immediate appeal

39:10.050 --> 39:11.652
to have your ruling
reversed.

39:11.685 --> 39:14.454
Your decision is unjust,

39:14.487 --> 39:16.923
unconscionable,
and wholly unsupported

39:16.957 --> 39:18.692
in law or fact!

39:19.325 --> 39:21.562
It is a reflection
of this court's animus

39:21.595 --> 39:23.229
against me and my office,

39:23.263 --> 39:24.965
and will form the basis

39:24.998 --> 39:28.669
of my personal complaint
to the judicial council!

39:28.702 --> 39:30.804
Mr. Walsh--
I'm not finished!

39:30.837 --> 39:34.174
Your decision to put a killer
back on the street

39:34.207 --> 39:35.842
should not go unpunished!

39:36.577 --> 39:39.445
It is my hope
the legislature will consider

39:39.479 --> 39:43.684
appropriate actions,
including possible impeachment.

39:47.754 --> 39:52.392
You crossed the line...
a long time ago, Mr. Walsh.

39:53.760 --> 39:56.462
I ascribe your
inappropriate response

39:56.496 --> 39:59.800
to the fact that
ultimately you know

39:59.833 --> 40:03.103
this whole disaster
is your fault.

40:04.971 --> 40:07.440
This court is adjourned.

40:17.951 --> 40:19.753
That's it? It's over?

40:20.954 --> 40:22.122
Yeah, Michael, it's over.

40:22.155 --> 40:24.490
(sighs) Hey, thanks.

40:25.659 --> 40:26.927
Send me the bill.

40:36.402 --> 40:37.738
(door opens)

40:39.172 --> 40:41.074
You accused me
of perjury, Helen.

40:41.107 --> 40:45.311
Look, I did my ethical duty.

40:45.345 --> 40:48.549
What excuse do you have
for ripping me apart up there?

40:48.582 --> 40:51.718
I was trying to save
this case, Helen.

40:51.752 --> 40:53.587
I wasn't railroading
an innocent man.

40:53.620 --> 40:54.955
I wanted to give MacIntyre

40:54.988 --> 40:57.023
the fair trial
he was avoiding

40:57.057 --> 40:59.693
by killing a witness.

40:59.726 --> 41:01.461
PATRICIA: He's going free?

41:02.796 --> 41:05.932
Patricia...
we are so sorry.

41:05.966 --> 41:08.268
You made this happen.

41:08.301 --> 41:10.070
How can you tell me
that you're sorry?

41:10.103 --> 41:12.773
I had to testify
truthfully.

41:12.806 --> 41:15.576
The truth is Michael MacIntyre
took my father's business,

41:15.609 --> 41:17.410
then took his life.

41:19.713 --> 41:21.447
And you let him get away.

41:33.727 --> 41:36.129
I did my ethical duty.

41:36.162 --> 41:38.298
Only because
you were dragged into it.

41:39.299 --> 41:40.601
You're not a hero.

42:05.258 --> 42:09.730
(music playing)

42:31.652 --> 42:32.653
You stinker!
