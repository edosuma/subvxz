(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

02:44.632 --> 02:48.935
It was just a few beers, a
few whiskeys, a few spliffs,

02:48.936 --> 02:51.871
nothing special, no blast,
enough to get me flying,

02:51.872 --> 02:52.872
you know?

02:56.343 --> 02:59.779
I passed out, but at no
point, I mean, I didn't invite

02:59.780 --> 03:01.446
these guys to fuck me, you know?

03:03.250 --> 03:05.652
Later I told my
bitch of a cousin

03:05.653 --> 03:07.353
what happened and she
just shrugged and said,

03:07.354 --> 03:09.255
I'd been teasing them all night.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.857
You just gave them the
wrong impression, she said.

03:14.128 --> 03:16.094
As if it wasn't their fault,
you know?

03:17.264 --> 03:18.264
Nothing happened.

03:19.266 --> 03:20.933
You woke up and they let you go.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.238
I trusted my cousin.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.543
Michael and David, and
then they were her friends.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.214
Did you tell anyone
aside from your cousin?

03:34.215 --> 03:35.481
Your parents?

03:35.482 --> 03:36.349
The police?

03:36.350 --> 03:37.850
Did you talk to anyone else?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.986
You haven't met my parents.

03:39.987 --> 03:42.054
And the cops, what would
they've done?

03:43.958 --> 03:45.992
You don't know what
it feels like.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.027
You just sit here in
your comfy chair,

03:48.028 --> 03:49.162
and you nod,
and you judge people,

03:49.163 --> 03:50.295
and decide their fate.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.232
You don't know shit!

03:56.203 --> 03:57.870
It says in your case
report that you attacked

03:57.871 --> 04:00.006
Mr. Allen in a car park.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.475
Do you think violence was
the appropriate response?

04:02.476 --> 04:04.877
That prick violated me.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.478
He got what he deserved.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.182
And Michael, well.

04:09.183 --> 04:11.017
There's an ongoing legal
case against both of them.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.952
Oh spare me that
legal bullshit.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.587
What he did to me
can't be undone.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.522
But you can learn
strategies to deal with it,

04:16.523 --> 04:18.558
better strategies than violence.

04:18.559 --> 04:20.226
Arts and sports are ways.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.527
I found a way that
works for me.

04:21.528 --> 04:24.330
But you have to
channel your anger.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.666
For example archery is
a good way of combining

04:26.667 --> 04:29.501
both physical and mental
self-discipline.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.414
What?

04:43.317 --> 04:44.783
Archery didn't work for you?

04:47.588 --> 04:48.887

What are you talking about?

39:47.619 --> 39:51.188
I'm just saying, it
might get easier for you,

39:51.189 --> 39:56.226
if you just forgave him,
doesn't he deserve forgiveness?

39:58.597 --> 40:01.264
I've never stopped
wondering why it happened.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.300
I've never fully understood it.

40:05.137 --> 40:07.504
Not after the trial, the
evidence, everything.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.409
But what if he didn't
mean to do it?

40:11.410 --> 40:13.910
What did he just fall
into me by accident then?

40:14.880 --> 40:17.515
Oh there's someone lying in the
alley way with a broken arm,

40:17.516 --> 40:19.550
and oops my trousers just
dropped.

40:19.551 --> 40:20.985
Alright I just.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.721
I've worked with survivors
of abuse for awhile now,

40:23.722 --> 40:25.989
rape is never an accident,
it's intentional.

40:32.831 --> 40:35.298
Why did you speak up for
him in the witness box?

40:39.070 --> 40:40.203
Someone had to.

40:42.941 --> 40:43.941
He was my mate.

40:45.877 --> 40:47.644
And his sister never
turned up so,

40:48.680 --> 40:50.547
she was the only family
he had left.

40:51.917 --> 40:55.185
I heard she died a few years
later, drugs.

40:57.556 --> 40:59.023
Ben was never the kind
of guy who talked much

40:59.024 --> 41:00.890
about his feelings or emotions.

41:02.727 --> 41:03.727
Don't know why.

41:06.364 --> 41:10.034
Maybe it's his upbringing,
maybe he never learned how.

41:10.035 --> 41:14.103
What I'm getting at,
what if he didn't do it?

41:17.809 --> 41:19.242
What if someone set him up?

41:23.181 --> 41:25.382
Sure, it's possible
but not probable.

wear a ski mask?

Look Jamie, you can't
believe in conspiracies.

41:36.461 --> 41:39.230
Yes, he wore a mask, but
the police found it in

41:39.231 --> 41:41.798
Ben's room and he
admitted his guilt.

reasonable one here eh?

So could you please tell him
that it makes far more sense

44:16.388 --> 44:18.322
to just follow the
stream back to the beach

44:18.323 --> 44:20.057

44:41.246 --> 44:42.146
we are here.

44:42.147 --> 44:45.481

have water and cover.

into those hobgoblins

45:17.449 --> 45:20.217
the way along the

59:43.981 --> 59:44.881
What Legion?

59:44.882 --> 59:49.017
The Foreign Legion,
where real men come from!

59:50.421 --> 59:51.853
If you want I can show you.

59:53.223 --> 59:54.723
Don't worry about him love.

59:57.795 --> 01:00:00.329

you'll like this one too.

So that fluffy bunny rabbit
we came across on the path

01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:11.040
back there, now,
not many people know

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:14.978
that fluffy bunny rabbits
have a very important function

01:00:14.979 --> 01:00:20.149
in the Legion, every troop
carries a sackful of them.

01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.386
When men are in the
field in woods like this,

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:26.522
it's very hard to find
a good fuck.

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:28.958

over here,

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:31.728

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:36.264
So we take one of the fluffy
bunny rabbits out of the bag

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:40.335
and we jam its head in a drawer.

01:00:41.605 --> 01:00:44.941
And then we get the
soldier to fuck that rabbit

01:00:44.942 --> 01:00:50.012
right up its ass, just as the
Legionnaire's about to cum

01:00:50.214 --> 01:00:55.283
we slam that drawer shut and
that fluffy bunny rabbit's ass
