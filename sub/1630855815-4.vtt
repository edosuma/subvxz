00:06.882 --> 00:09.051
[Shetty] Welcome to
Godolkin University.

00:11.137 --> 00:13.639
- [gasps]
- [Shetty] Marie,
most kids around here

00:13.723 --> 00:15.850
with a history like yours...

00:17.143 --> 00:18.769
...they don't get adopted.

00:18.853 --> 00:22.273
But a God U graduate?
You could wipe all that clean

00:22.356 --> 00:23.816
- and start fresh.
- So don't fuck it up?

00:23.899 --> 00:26.026
I have been dying to meet you.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.320
[retching]

00:28.404 --> 00:30.781
- Is this the biggest dick
you've ever seen?
- Relatively.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.116
- Jordan!
- What the fuck?!

00:32.198 --> 00:33.743
[gunshot]

00:34.618 --> 00:36.871
- You're a Supe.
- Or I'm just
a very good magician.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.748
Golden Boy suffered
a full psychotic break.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.541
[Marie] He killed Brink!

00:40.624 --> 00:41.751
I'm so sorry.

00:44.754 --> 00:47.256
If you're watching this,
I guess things got fucked.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.841
They have my brother,
he's underneath the school.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.093
They call it The Woods, it's
like this fucked-up hospital.

00:52.595 --> 00:55.431
Sam. Go to sleep.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.267
Don't say another fucking word
about this.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.269
- What are you doing here?
- Your brother sent me

01:00.352 --> 01:01.437
to get you out of here.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.898
- [alarm blares]
- [electricity crackling]

01:05.107 --> 01:06.358
What the fuck?!

01:09.069 --> 01:10.946
Fuck.

01:30.508 --> 01:32.384
[Shetty] What the hell happened?

01:32.468 --> 01:36.931
I mean, maybe Sam penetrated
the ear canal with, um...

01:37.014 --> 01:39.015
his member?

01:39.098 --> 01:42.561
That's the sum total
of your searing insight,

01:42.645 --> 01:44.646
that Sam skull-fucked Bob here?

01:44.729 --> 01:47.316
Okay, this is Greg,
and I don't know.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.735
Sam's stronger
than Golden Boy ever was.

01:49.819 --> 01:52.029
I don't know how
to contain someone like that.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.948
That's painfully obvious.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.083
Find Sam.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.460
I want the whole
security team on this.

02:06.544 --> 02:08.753
Well, half of them are dead.

02:08.838 --> 02:11.340
Then use the other half.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.262
Because if Vought finds out
about this, Doctor...

02:17.513 --> 02:21.600
...I can promise you and I
get skull-fucked next.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.450
[Marie] I found the tracker!

02:39.451 --> 02:40.911
There's blood on it.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.079
[blows on tracker]

02:44.164 --> 02:45.457
Maybe this is good.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.210
She... she got out
of the hellhole.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.462
It looks like a meteor
crashed here.

02:50.546 --> 02:52.715
Maybe Sam can jump
like Maeve does?

02:52.798 --> 02:54.425
He landed here with Emma
and then jumped again.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.011
- What were you thinking?
- I had to do something.

02:57.094 --> 03:00.180
Yeah, but...
you didn't do anything.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.308
And of all people,
you went to Emma?

03:02.391 --> 03:05.769
- [phone buzzes]
- [phone chimes]

03:05.853 --> 03:08.272
- What is it?
- [Jordan] New rankings are out.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.609
Andre's number one, you're two,

03:11.692 --> 03:12.943
and I'm still five.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.403
Wow.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.155
- Congrats.
- [Andre] Rankings? Really?

03:16.238 --> 03:17.740
We got bigger fucking problems.

03:17.823 --> 03:19.742
Says number one.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.952
But you're right, we do.

03:22.036 --> 03:24.329
Turns out the school has a
fucking Mengele Health Clinic.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.248
We don't know who's in on it.

03:26.332 --> 03:29.585
If... if Brink was,

03:29.668 --> 03:31.879
maybe other professors,
maybe Dean Shetty.

03:31.962 --> 03:34.173
But you guys are gonna get
a green van

03:34.256 --> 03:37.301
and a talking dog
and fucking solve it?

03:38.469 --> 03:41.847
- You're just gonna end up
like that fucking cricket.
- Emma.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.433
The lost girl
who's in deep shit?

03:44.516 --> 03:45.893
Her name is Emma.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.312
- Jordan's right.
- Fucking thank you.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.773
Wherever Emma is, it's not here.

03:50.856 --> 03:51.941
Cate, come on.

03:52.024 --> 03:54.276
I told you not to do
anything stupid.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.695
Why don't you ever
fuckin' listen to...

03:58.489 --> 04:00.991
This girl could be dead, Andre.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.077
We are in over our heads.

04:13.379 --> 04:16.255
Hey, are, uh... are you okay?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.216
Did I... Did I squash you?

04:18.300 --> 04:21.345
You, uh, you look
a little bigger. Did you grow?

04:21.428 --> 04:23.430
I think I must have
swallowed something

04:23.514 --> 04:25.099
when I went through
that guy's head.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.061
Where are we?

04:29.144 --> 04:30.688
[Sam] Old drive-in movie place.

04:31.689 --> 04:34.441
Luke and me used to come
every weekend before it closed.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.779
You have a... a...

04:39.780 --> 04:41.573
...piece of eardrum
on your shoulder.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.159
Mm.

04:49.498 --> 04:50.707
Yeah.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.209
[shaky breaths]

04:52.292 --> 04:53.836
I killed that guy.

04:53.919 --> 04:57.423
Well, uh, he-he was
a sadistic asshole. [chuckles]

04:57.506 --> 04:59.758
Does that make you
feel any better?

04:59.842 --> 05:01.510
What if he had kids?

05:01.593 --> 05:04.888
You saved me, Emma.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.724
You did.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.059
Okay.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.436
Okay.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.396
Do you think there's a phone
in here somewhere?

05:12.479 --> 05:13.939
I mean, we need help.

05:14.023 --> 05:16.775
Oh, no, I-I... There's only
one person who can help.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.028
I-I got to get ahold of Luke.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.699
Sam, I'm so sorry.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.202
Your brother died.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.205
[weak chuckle]

05:30.289 --> 05:32.541
I know I make weird jokes,
but that's a...

05:32.624 --> 05:35.919
That's a really,
really weird joke.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.921
It's not.
I should have told you sooner.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.339
I am so sorry.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.800
Wait,
what are you talking about?

05:41.884 --> 05:45.387
Nothing could kill Luke.
He's-he's... he's too strong.

05:45.471 --> 05:48.223
He killed himself.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.266
[Sam grunts softly]

05:51.143 --> 05:52.811
Wait, no.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.814
I'm sorry.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.028
[screams]

06:04.448 --> 06:06.658
[cries out]

06:20.047 --> 06:21.340
I'm here, Sam.

06:22.341 --> 06:24.051
You'll leave, too.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.096
I won't.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.515
[voice shaking]
You will.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.142
I'll fuck up somehow.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.189
Everybody always leaves me.

06:37.272 --> 06:39.358
I promise, I'm with you.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.577
[Tek] Every mystery's
scattered clues

06:50.661 --> 06:53.038
and hidden corners of darkness.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.585
I'm Tek Knight,
and I won't stop searching

06:58.669 --> 07:00.087
until I've found...

07:02.256 --> 07:04.258
The Whole Truth.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.929
Godolkin University,

07:09.012 --> 07:11.849
a place where only
the bravest heroes graduate.

07:11.932 --> 07:16.019
Queen Maeve, The Deep, A-Train,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.981
and, of course, myself.

07:19.064 --> 07:22.693
But tragedy has rocked
this institution to its core.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.740
A rising star who took
his own life.

07:28.824 --> 07:33.203
But why did the Golden Boy,
who had everything, do it?

07:33.287 --> 07:37.082
This whole case is
a rabbit hole into the unknown,

07:37.166 --> 07:39.585
and I won't stop
plunging its depths

07:39.668 --> 07:41.295
until I get...

07:41.378 --> 07:43.922
[laughing]

07:44.006 --> 07:45.007
Sorry.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.800
Sorry.
Cut it, guys, cut.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.927
"Plunging its depths"?

07:49.011 --> 07:51.388
I mean, what? Come on.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.764
Let's just... [clears throat]

07:52.848 --> 07:54.391
Let's go again. Let's reset.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.144
Ugh. I slit a sheet,
a sheet I slit,

07:57.227 --> 07:58.979
and on the slitted sheet I sit.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.647
[groans]

08:01.648 --> 08:03.817
- All right. [clears throat]
- [director] Back to one.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.277
Ready.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.495
Good morning.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.997
It's an honor to have
such an esteemed alumnus

08:17.080 --> 08:17.998
back with us.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.417
[chuckling] Bullshit.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.002
You hate that I'm here.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.837
I make you nervous.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.797
I can understand
why you'd think that.

08:25.881 --> 08:28.675
Your reputation is formidable.

08:28.759 --> 08:32.136
Was it Ironcast
who killed himself

08:32.221 --> 08:34.514
the morning after
you interrogated him?

08:34.597 --> 08:36.767
Strange how many
of your subjects

08:36.850 --> 08:39.852
end up dead
or beaten into comas.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.690
I, myself, have nothing to hide.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.108
Are you sure about that?

08:46.193 --> 08:47.903
That small bead of sweat
on your brow...

08:49.780 --> 08:52.199
...adrenaline seeping
from your pores.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.618
And you're ovulating,
by the way.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.537
[chuckles] You must be
a delight at parties.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.538
[Tek chuckles]

08:58.622 --> 08:59.998
Ashley Barrett asked me to

09:00.082 --> 09:01.959
extend your production
every courtesy,

09:02.042 --> 09:04.086
but I must say I'm not sure

09:04.169 --> 09:05.629
I understand why you're here.

09:05.712 --> 09:08.882
#WhyDidGoldenBoyDoIt
is still trending number one.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.968
Yes, but...

09:12.135 --> 09:13.804
...what has Ashley told you?

09:13.887 --> 09:17.432
You mean did she tell me
that Golden Boy killed Brink

09:17.516 --> 09:21.144
in a misguided attempt to rescue
his brother from The Woods?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.063
So you know exactly why.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.731
But it's my job to...

09:24.815 --> 09:27.693
It's our job to make sure
no one else knows.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.611
And how do you intend
to do that?

09:29.695 --> 09:33.740
Well, the usual.
Misdirection, obfuscation.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.617
Find a patsy
and destroy their life.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.119
You're gonna blame
an innocent student

09:37.202 --> 09:38.495
for Luke's hysteria?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.956
Oh, yeah. Yeah. [laughs]

09:41.039 --> 09:43.125
I'm gonna Johnny Depp
someone so hard

09:43.208 --> 09:45.752
they're gonna want to crawl
into a hole and die.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.087
[chuckles]

09:48.171 --> 09:50.132
Just stay away
from the top five.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.843
[Tek] Eh...

09:52.926 --> 09:54.845
There's always more
where they came from.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.930
- You'll manage.
- [glass softly ringing]

09:57.014 --> 10:01.310
Oh, I would love to chat
with Golden Boy's brother.

10:01.393 --> 10:04.938
For background. Sam, is it?

10:05.022 --> 10:06.648
Oh, no, I'm afraid
that's not possible.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.567
He's far too dangerous.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.029
I'm gonna need access
to the tapes

10:12.112 --> 10:13.530
from campus surveillance,

10:13.613 --> 10:15.490
a full list of
Golden Boy's classmates,

10:15.574 --> 10:18.118
girlfriends, fuckbois.

10:18.201 --> 10:22.039
Oh, and a couple of reflectors
from the film department.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.791
- Fuckin' Roy
forgot our bounces.
- Hmm.

10:28.587 --> 10:29.963
Ah...

10:33.925 --> 10:35.635
[door opens]

10:35.719 --> 10:37.471
[door closes]

10:38.638 --> 10:39.890
Fuck.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.058
[knock at door]

10:45.020 --> 10:46.229
You look high as fuck.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.191
What, me? No, not at all.

10:52.361 --> 10:55.322
Whoa, hey. [laughs] Sorry.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.868
You're, uh...

10:59.951 --> 11:01.536
you're right.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.121
And I'm sorry.
I should have listened.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.750
I don't know where Emma is,

11:06.833 --> 11:09.169
and I don't know what to do.

11:09.252 --> 11:13.256
And I... I might also be
a tiny bit high as fuck.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.766
Thank you.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.768
[Cate sighs]

11:24.851 --> 11:27.187
And my dad knows.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.189
Knows what?

11:29.272 --> 11:31.274
Everything.

11:33.568 --> 11:37.864
About The Woods,
and what they're doing.

11:37.948 --> 11:40.909
And he told me to drop it.

11:42.744 --> 11:45.497
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.501
Maybe he's trying
to protect you.

11:49.584 --> 11:52.170
No. You know, when I was a kid,

11:52.254 --> 11:54.131
when I was alone,
I used to watch

11:54.214 --> 11:57.592
his Area 51 movies
over and over again,

11:57.676 --> 12:00.387
and I'd try to copy
his-his stance.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.973
The one when
he holds out his hand...

12:03.056 --> 12:05.350
made of steel.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.186
Yeah. Full of shit.

12:08.270 --> 12:11.356
All I wanted was
to be like him, he just...

12:14.776 --> 12:17.195
This whole time,

12:17.279 --> 12:19.865
he was mixed up in all this.

12:19.948 --> 12:22.117
He's not the man
that I thought he was.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.870

- Oh, my God. Emma.
- Uh... Hi.

34:31.862 --> 34:33.280
- Are you okay?
- Uh... [stammers]

34:33.362 --> 34:35.072
Sorry, Sam is going
after Dr. Cardosa.

34:35.157 --> 34:36.241
- We have to stop him.
- Who?

34:36.324 --> 34:37.618
Luke's brother.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.495
- He's actually kind of hot.
- No, who's Cardosa?

34:39.578 --> 34:41.038
[Jordan] Dr. Cardosa.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.206
He used to work with Brink.
I know where he lives.

34:43.290 --> 34:44.875
Oh, shit.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.963
[bird chirping]

34:52.549 --> 34:55.135
Pretty spot
to confess your sins.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.055
No camera crew?

34:58.138 --> 35:00.098
You said leave them behind.

35:00.182 --> 35:03.143
I wanted us away from the campus
security cameras, too.

35:03.227 --> 35:06.104
Oh, if you think dragging me
to a secluded area

35:06.188 --> 35:09.483
for a blowie
is gonna save you...

35:09.566 --> 35:12.110
- Well, let's see.
- Mm.

35:12.194 --> 35:15.572
Did you recently visit the brain
tumor center at Johns Hopkins?

35:19.952 --> 35:22.788
You have a small tumor
in your brain.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.832
It will eventually be fatal,

35:24.915 --> 35:26.917
but I imagine
you already know that.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.796
I'd hazard you also know
it's the cause of your...

35:34.091 --> 35:37.135
...shall we say
"unusual proclivity"?

35:39.763 --> 35:41.265
I don't know what you mean.

35:41.348 --> 35:43.100
Ah.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.272
Compilation of
your greatest hits.

[groaning]

35:52.234 --> 35:53.277
Oh, yeah.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.582
Yeah, what is it
with skull-fucking?

36:13.630 --> 36:17.175
So how do we think

36:21.430 --> 36:22.973
you come across?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.269
Okay, what-what do you want?

36:29.521 --> 36:31.899
There was nothing to find
at God U, or with me.

36:31.982 --> 36:35.110
Nothing to tell Vought
and no reason to stay.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.945
As long as you're off campus
by end of day,

36:37.029 --> 36:39.489
this video stays off Instagram.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.367
Thoughts?

36:46.788 --> 36:48.498
[softly] Yeah.

36:53.670 --> 36:57.716
It's easier to probe
the dark hole of conspiracy

36:57.799 --> 37:01.094
than accept a tragedy
with no meaning or motive.

37:01.178 --> 37:02.638
But that's what this is.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.515

37:05.599 --> 37:10.354
Fortunately, Godolkin University

37:18.820 --> 37:20.656
Now...

37:20.739 --> 37:24.493
with this case behind me,
I move on to the next mystery.

37:25.494 --> 37:28.789
To seek out The Whole Truth.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.292
We good?

All right, give me
a few minutes alone, please?

38:19.548 --> 38:21.174
Look at me. Look at me.

38:21.258 --> 38:23.468
Whatever you need,
I can get for you.

38:23.552 --> 38:25.554
Okay? Just-Just...

38:25.637 --> 38:27.014
Just let my family go, please.

I escaped and you caught me.
Y-You're one of them!

who you were then.

No! You are not
touching me again, Cate!
