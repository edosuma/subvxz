-What, then?

24:37.054 --> 24:38.994
Remember my seventh birthday,
Dad?

24:39.094 --> 24:41.234
'Course you don't.

24:41.334 --> 24:43.334
'Cause you weren't there.

24:43.974 --> 24:45.974
You were hungover
in bed all day.

24:46.614 --> 24:48.614
You know, I got up that morning.

24:49.734 --> 24:51.735
Made my own birthday cake.

24:52.735 --> 24:53.875
I cut a slice for Mum,

24:53.975 --> 24:55.875
'cause I had to imagine
she was there for me.

24:55.975 --> 24:58.275
Man, I had just lost my wife!

24:58.375 --> 25:00.375
I'd just lost my mum, Dad!

25:01.615 --> 25:03.615
I needed you, Dad.

25:04.695 --> 25:06.695
And the truth is
you weren't there.

25:09.616 --> 25:11.616
You've never been there.

You're in love with him.

25:37.457 --> 25:39.457
I was.

25:40.537 --> 25:42.537
I'm not.

25:43.617 --> 25:45.358

25:45.458 --> 25:46.798
It just hurts.

25:53.778 --> 25:56.458
Santi really loved
that poem, Mum.

So did I.
