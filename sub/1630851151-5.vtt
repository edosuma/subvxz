WEBVTT

00:08.774 --> 00:12.345
-* Feliz Navidad *
-(laughter)

00:12.478 --> 00:13.679
* Feliz Navidad... *

00:13.813 --> 00:14.980
I don't know, Jake.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.350
There's got to be some girl
you like.

00:17.483 --> 00:19.852
* Prospero aÃ±o y felicidad... *

00:19.985 --> 00:22.122
The girl in the purple--
she's kind of cute.

00:22.222 --> 00:25.791
Oh. I think she used to work
at the White House

00:25.891 --> 00:28.194
a couple years ago.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.364
Yeah?

00:31.497 --> 00:33.199
Yeah.

00:35.168 --> 00:36.502
Good luck.

00:36.636 --> 00:38.504
Um...

00:38.638 --> 00:41.207
I've been trying to give off
an air of unapproachability.

00:41.341 --> 00:42.308
-Mm.
-Was I successful?

00:42.408 --> 00:43.976
Oh, yes. Good job.

00:44.076 --> 00:46.045
-Good. Good.
-(laughs)

00:46.212 --> 00:47.413
I'm Jake.
Jake Tapper.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.582
-I'm Monica.
-Can I, uh,

00:49.715 --> 00:51.050
buy you a drink?

00:51.184 --> 00:52.652
Oh, you know,
it's-it's a weeknight.

00:52.752 --> 00:54.187
I was gonna head home
and have dinner.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.189
You know they have food here.

00:56.322 --> 00:57.590
It's, uh... it's Tex-Mex.

00:57.723 --> 00:59.359
It's world-famous
Washington, D.C. Tex-Mex.

01:00.693 --> 01:02.562
Sure.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.029
On long-haul flights,

01:04.164 --> 01:05.765
the secretary of defense
does press avails,

01:05.898 --> 01:07.567
and then, they all get
to go to sleep,

01:07.700 --> 01:10.069
and I stay up through the night
transcribing every word.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.204
That sounds fun.

01:11.337 --> 01:12.738
It's a spelling minefield.

01:12.905 --> 01:15.175
The Chernomyrdins
and the Khmelnytskys.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.009
I mean, you go east of Austria,

01:17.109 --> 01:19.879
and the vowels are just never
where you expect them to be.

01:20.012 --> 01:21.414
Plus, I'm a shit typist, so...

01:21.581 --> 01:22.748
(laughs)

01:22.882 --> 01:24.584
But, um,
talking about it now, I...

01:24.717 --> 01:28.688
I've been sort of myopic
this past year,

01:28.788 --> 01:31.691
and... I really look at it.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.393
This job's actually been
kind of neat.

01:33.526 --> 01:36.061
-Mm.
-Yeah, I'm actually... I'm...

01:36.196 --> 01:38.063
I'm moving soon.
I have a job interview

01:38.198 --> 01:41.267
-in New York on... on Friday.
-Ah.

01:41.401 --> 01:44.304
What did you mean--
you've been myopic?

01:44.437 --> 01:47.240
I don't know. I just...

01:47.373 --> 01:50.410
I guess I've been a bit
of a D.C. zombie.

01:50.543 --> 01:52.044
Hmm.

01:52.144 --> 01:53.879
And I'm... I'm ready to wake up.

01:53.979 --> 01:56.249
-Oh. Thank you.
-Thank you.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.117
-We're gonna split that.
-No, no, no.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.952
-Yes.
-This is a date.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.458
(distant phones ringing)

02:15.000 --> 02:16.902
(footsteps approaching)

02:17.002 --> 02:18.804
MONICA:
Hey, Linda.

02:18.971 --> 02:20.506
What to watch me fix the Xerox
for the 20th time

02:20.640 --> 02:22.141
-this week?
-Oh. No.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.176
-(laughs)
-Oh, wait.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.646
-Are these the invitations?
-Yes.

02:26.779 --> 02:28.013
Ah.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.815
You can help me hand them out.

02:30.816 --> 02:33.018
God. How did you afford these?

02:33.152 --> 02:35.821
Oh. Well, I go nuts
for Christmas.

02:35.988 --> 02:37.590
I know
it's maybe not your thing.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.592
Oh, please. We're L.A. Jews.

02:39.692 --> 02:41.627
I've been going to Christmas
parties since I was born.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.629
You can come, right?

02:43.763 --> 02:45.265
When do you go up
for your interview?

02:45.365 --> 02:46.599
Thursday. I'm a wreck.

02:46.699 --> 02:48.268
You'll do great.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.803
Ugh. After Revlon,
we're going to 21 with basically

02:50.936 --> 02:53.306
my entire extended family,
and I have to look nice.

02:53.439 --> 02:55.308
My family's a whole thing.

02:55.441 --> 02:57.109
So I think I'm gonna wear
that navy dress I showed you.

02:57.209 --> 02:58.611
You got it cleaned?

02:58.711 --> 03:00.846
Oh, no, not yet,
but I will before I go.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.683
Oh. Merry Christmas.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.685
LUCIANNE:
How'd the girl take the news?

03:05.818 --> 03:07.853
Oh. I still haven't told her
about the subpoena.

03:08.020 --> 03:09.855
-You haven't? Why?
-I know.

03:10.022 --> 03:12.858
If she doesn't hear it from you,
she's going to get suspicious.

03:12.992 --> 03:14.827
Yes, I realize that.
I'm going to tell her.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.028
That-That's not even
why I called.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.498
She's gonna get
the dress cleaned.

03:18.631 --> 03:19.532
-What?
-She wants

03:19.665 --> 03:21.301
-to wear it.
-That stain is

03:21.401 --> 03:23.035
white gold.

03:23.168 --> 03:25.705
It proves what she says
on your tapes really happened.

03:25.838 --> 03:27.707
Ugh.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.742
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.877
It can absolutely be used
to match DNA,

03:32.011 --> 03:33.313
even years later.

03:33.413 --> 03:35.315
(sighs)
Really?

03:35.415 --> 03:38.984
You get her on the horn
right now, and you stop her!

03:39.084 --> 03:41.153
(phone beeps)

03:48.528 --> 03:51.364
-I need a minute.
-Uh, yeah, this is
your favorite thing,

03:51.497 --> 03:53.566
-and you had us stay home
for a night.
-I just, I have to do a call.

03:53.699 --> 03:54.767
Just need a minute.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.939
(Allison scoffs softly)

04:01.407 --> 04:03.409
(line ringing)

04:09.515 --> 04:11.451
-Hello?
-LINDA: Hi.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.752
How are you?

04:12.918 --> 04:14.720
Fine. I'm tired.
I just got off the treadmill.

04:14.854 --> 04:16.088
LINDA:
You're so good.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.590
-(laughs)
-Listen.

04:17.723 --> 04:19.725
I wanted to say to you--
and you can do

04:19.859 --> 04:22.528
what you want with this--
but the blue dress.

04:22.628 --> 04:24.964
I don't think you should
wear that to your interview.

04:25.097 --> 04:26.932
-Why?
-Call me crazy, but

04:27.066 --> 04:29.735
I believe it would be smart
for you to keep that,

04:29.869 --> 04:34.106
uncleaned, in your possession
in case you ever need it years

04:34.239 --> 04:35.074
-from now.
-(laughs)

04:35.207 --> 04:36.442
What?

04:36.609 --> 04:37.943
You think I need to keep

04:38.077 --> 04:40.446
a dress with that on it
for years?

04:40.613 --> 04:43.248
Okay, instead of always just
dissing what I say,

04:43.383 --> 04:45.551
listen.

04:45.651 --> 04:47.953
My cousin is a genetic...

04:48.120 --> 04:49.989
whatchamacallit.

04:50.122 --> 04:52.958
And during O.J. Simpson,
I was hooked on the trial.

04:53.092 --> 04:54.827
It was fabulous,
but all the

04:54.960 --> 04:57.296
DNA was Greek to me,
so I asked him about it.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.298
And he told me

04:59.465 --> 05:02.101
that an old crusty bit of semen
can be matched

05:02.234 --> 05:04.637
to a man's identity,
even ages later.

05:04.770 --> 05:07.507
But why would I care if it could
be matched to his identity?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.442
If you were ever to need proof.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.477
But I'm never going
to come forward about this.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.646
(laughing):
I'm not saying you would ever.

05:13.779 --> 05:16.315
And if anyone else did,
I would deny, deny, deny.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.951
I know. I know that, but just

05:19.084 --> 05:20.686
-do this...
-(sighs)

05:20.820 --> 05:22.955
for your own ultimate
protection,

05:23.088 --> 05:24.123
which-- mea culpa--

05:24.256 --> 05:26.091
I hope you never need it.

05:27.159 --> 05:29.595
I would say this
to my own daughter.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.997
Hello?

05:32.164 --> 05:33.666
Look, I want to feel confident
at the interview,

05:33.799 --> 05:35.334
and I know I look good
in that dress.

05:37.369 --> 05:40.440
(laughs):
Well, I mean...

05:40.540 --> 05:42.842
If you think it's flattering,
I mean, that's what matters.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.177
What?

05:45.310 --> 05:47.847
I want you to look thin
and beautiful.

05:48.013 --> 05:50.282
-What does that mean?
-(scoffs)

05:50.382 --> 05:53.519
I'm sorry,
but I would want to be told.

05:53.653 --> 05:55.521
The truth is,
you look heavy in that dress.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.523
Are you serious?

05:57.657 --> 05:59.725
(TV plays quietly)

05:59.859 --> 06:01.694
Okay, well...
well, what's more slimming--

06:01.827 --> 06:04.697
the peach suit,
or the... or the dark teal?

06:04.864 --> 06:07.667
Your peach suit is exquisite.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.236
I think that works beautifully.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.183
*

06:44.003 --> 06:46.071
(sighs)

06:48.007 --> 06:49.909
(Starr humming
"O Little Town of Bethlehem")

06:50.042 --> 06:51.343
(elevator bell dings)

06:51.443 --> 06:54.113
-(humming continues)
-Good morning, Judge Starr.

06:54.246 --> 06:56.015
Hmm.
Good morning, Neille.

06:56.115 --> 06:58.417
They're in there
waiting for you.

06:59.885 --> 07:01.921
This is not going
to be pleasant.

07:02.087 --> 07:03.623
Mm-hmm.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.428
Morning.
Sorry I'm late.

07:13.398 --> 07:16.636
I wanted to read a verse,
if I may.

07:19.572 --> 07:23.809
"We are persecuted,
but not forsaken by God;

07:23.943 --> 07:26.946
cast down, but not destroyed."

07:27.112 --> 07:28.981
Corinthians,
chapter four, verse nine.

07:29.114 --> 07:30.750
That's a prayer
for the defeated.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.918
No one in this room
should feel defeated.

07:33.052 --> 07:36.989
Now, I've asked Paul to take
every piece of evidence we have

07:37.122 --> 07:39.124
on President Clinton
and Whitewater,

07:39.291 --> 07:41.060
and put it all
into one document

07:41.160 --> 07:42.995
so we can take a look
and decide,

07:43.128 --> 07:45.631
do we have enough
to recommend impeachment.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.767
No.
Not-not today, not yet.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.401
But we're close.

07:49.501 --> 07:50.736
This doesn't say to me
it's time to shut down.

07:50.836 --> 07:52.137
This says keep going.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.139
Oh, Jackie,
it's been four years.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.775
We've exhausted
all of our leads.

07:55.908 --> 07:58.110
Bill Clinton committed
loan fraud when he was governor,

07:58.243 --> 08:00.145
and then he lied
about it under oath.

08:00.312 --> 08:02.147
We're just one witness short
of proving that.

08:02.314 --> 08:04.316
Every potential crime
is one witness short.

08:04.483 --> 08:06.118
What'd you just say?

08:06.251 --> 08:08.821
I said we don't have it.
Do you think

08:08.954 --> 08:10.155
I don't feel
like a failure, too?

08:10.289 --> 08:11.591
We're failures if we quit.

08:11.691 --> 08:13.358
What am I...
the only one who sees this? Huh?

08:13.492 --> 08:15.427
Come on.
Kavanaugh, huh?

08:15.527 --> 08:16.829
You don't think
we should just quit?

08:16.996 --> 08:19.331
I never like to take "no"
for an answer,

08:19.464 --> 08:21.867
but, Jackie, there isn't
a path forward here.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.837
Oh, great. Okay,
so you all want to fucking fold.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.339
-Jackie, please.
-I'm sorry, Judge.

08:30.475 --> 08:33.779
I look around this room,
and I see success.

08:33.879 --> 08:35.881
They said we were
on a partisan witch hunt,

08:36.015 --> 08:37.650
but we found real wrongdoing.

08:37.783 --> 08:41.854
Because of us, the governor
of Arkansas had to resign,

08:42.021 --> 08:44.323
and we achieved 12 convictions

08:44.456 --> 08:46.291
of other people
around the Clintons.

08:46.391 --> 08:48.828
Yeah, but none of whom
would flip on Bill or Hillary.

08:48.961 --> 08:50.562
No, that didn't happen,

08:50.696 --> 08:52.364
and there's no indication
that's going to change,

08:52.497 --> 08:53.866
and that's our problem.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.737
Oh, Judge, you can't sit there
after all this time

08:57.870 --> 08:59.538
and tell me
that they're not guilty.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.041
In fact, I'll sit here
and tell you candidly

09:02.174 --> 09:05.010
that I believe President Clinton
is guilty as sin.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.412
Even worse,
I believe, he actively

09:07.546 --> 09:11.383
blocked people from cooperating
in this investigation.

09:11.516 --> 09:14.553
Now, I can believe that
and you can believe that,

09:14.720 --> 09:17.556
but it doesn't matter
what we believe.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.759
It matters what we can prove.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.397
Let's put it to a vote.

09:25.530 --> 09:28.267
Does anyone here feel
we have the goods

09:28.400 --> 09:30.169
to take this to the Hill

09:30.269 --> 09:33.706
and recommend the impeachment
of President Clinton?

09:45.417 --> 09:46.919
ASSOCIATE:
All right, Mr. President.

09:47.052 --> 09:49.588
Let's move on to a different
line of questioning.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.892
In 1987, you repeatedly visited
the home of Beth Coulson,

09:53.025 --> 09:54.927
always while
her husband was away.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.930
Was the purpose of these visits
to have sex with Beth Coulson?

09:58.063 --> 09:59.464
No, it was not.

09:59.598 --> 10:02.735
So you just happened to only
visit her when she was alone?

10:02.868 --> 10:04.269
Are you asking me a question?

10:04.403 --> 10:06.271
Yes. Do you honestly
expect us to believe

10:06.405 --> 10:07.907
that that was not
a sexual relationship?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.608
I told you before,
we were just friends.

10:09.742 --> 10:11.711
Let's move on
to Marilyn Jo Jenkins.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.113
Is it true that you met with her
four times in your private

10:14.246 --> 10:15.480
basement office at
the Arkansas Governor's Mansion?

10:15.614 --> 10:17.116
Fuck this.

10:17.249 --> 10:19.451
Mr. President, this is what

10:19.584 --> 10:20.920
they're going to do to you.

10:21.053 --> 10:22.454
Yeah, this is horseshit.
You should be making a list

10:22.587 --> 10:24.056
like this for Paula Jones.

10:24.156 --> 10:26.125
We are. When she sits
for her deposition

10:26.291 --> 10:27.927
next week,
she won't know what hit her.

10:28.060 --> 10:31.096
But right after that,
you're up, under oath.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.798
We can't delay it anymore.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.666
No. I bet you Kennedy didn't
have to answer this shit.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.769
Yeah, well, that was the '60s.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.771
Excuse me.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.840
What did you say?

10:41.907 --> 10:44.276
Just that...
that that was the '60s.

10:46.245 --> 10:48.080
Ti-Times are changing.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.614
For women.

10:49.749 --> 10:52.752
You know how many women
I have in my cabinet?

10:52.852 --> 10:54.954
Not... off the top of...

10:55.087 --> 10:56.521
I mean, there's, um...

10:56.655 --> 11:00.826
Janet Reno,
first female attorney general.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.963
Madeleine Albright, first female
secretary of state.

11:04.096 --> 11:08.333
Donna Shalala, secretary
of Health and Human Services.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.836
Alexis Herman,
secretary of Labor.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.005
Carol Browner, EPA.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.639
Aida Alvarez, SBA.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.176
Charlene Barshefsky,
U.S. trade rep.

11:17.342 --> 11:20.679
Janet Yellen, chair of the
Council of Economic Advisors.

11:20.813 --> 11:24.183
No one supports women
more than me.

11:29.288 --> 11:30.655
(clears throat)

11:30.790 --> 11:32.391
(door slams)

11:34.359 --> 11:35.861
(phone receiver clicks)

11:36.028 --> 11:37.797
(dialing)

11:41.466 --> 11:43.335
(line ringing)

11:43.468 --> 11:45.537
(sighs)

11:45.670 --> 11:47.706
(phone ringing)

11:51.844 --> 11:53.145
Hello?

11:53.245 --> 11:55.547
Hey. Did I wake you?

11:55.680 --> 11:57.749
No.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.352
No. It's fine.
I was awake.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.855
How you doing?

12:02.988 --> 12:04.689
Um, I'm good.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.892
I went to New York
for my Revlon interview,

12:07.026 --> 12:08.560
and they basically
offered me the job.

12:08.693 --> 12:10.863
Oh, that's great.
Good job.

12:10.996 --> 12:13.365
What's wrong?

12:15.567 --> 12:19.571
I just wanted to tell you, um...

12:19.738 --> 12:23.242
I saw the witness list
for the Paula Jones suit,

12:23.408 --> 12:25.210
and your name is on it.

12:25.344 --> 12:26.578
What?

12:26.745 --> 12:28.380
It's-it's not a big deal.

12:28.513 --> 12:30.549
It just broke my heart a little
to see you there.

12:30.682 --> 12:32.251
Wait.
Paula Jones.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.286
Why would I be on the witness
list? What does that mean?

12:34.419 --> 12:36.021
Oh, it doesn't mean anything.

12:36.121 --> 12:37.422
You know,
this thing is pretty much

12:37.589 --> 12:39.191
every woman I've ever talked to.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.126
But we've more than talked.

12:42.694 --> 12:45.430
You know, you-you probably
won't even get a subpoena.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.632
Okay, okay, well,
but what if I do?

12:47.766 --> 12:49.634
Well, for something like this,
you know,

12:49.768 --> 12:52.271
you probably wouldn't even
have to show up

12:52.404 --> 12:53.772
in person.

12:53.906 --> 12:56.075
You just get a lawyer
to draft an affidavit.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.743
-Saying what?
-Well, Monica...

13:00.412 --> 13:01.947
...what would you want to say?

13:06.285 --> 13:08.787
(quietly):
Uh...

13:08.954 --> 13:11.223
I would say that nothing
ever happened between us.

13:16.061 --> 13:19.631
If anything happens...

13:19.764 --> 13:21.800
you can call Betty.

13:23.268 --> 13:24.970
Okay.

13:25.104 --> 13:27.139
Thank you.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.975
Can I just ask?

13:30.142 --> 13:32.477
This lawsuit has caused
so much trouble for you.

13:32.644 --> 13:34.313
Why don't you just
try to settle it again?

13:34.479 --> 13:35.948
Well...

13:37.917 --> 13:39.651
It's complicated.

13:39.784 --> 13:43.688
(sighs heavily)

13:43.822 --> 13:45.490
-I mean,
I think this is charming.
-(sighs)

13:45.624 --> 13:47.159
Okay, I don't understand what's
supposed to fit on this plate.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.194
-Cookies, Monica.
-Like what?

13:49.328 --> 13:50.996
-One single cookie?
-Ugh.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.998
It's about creating
a festive ambience,

13:53.132 --> 13:55.000
not the utility of the plate.

13:55.134 --> 13:58.270
Sorry. I really don't mean
to be a drag. I just...

13:58.370 --> 14:01.373
I can't stop thinking
about my name on that list.

14:01.506 --> 14:04.977
Well, it sounded like he wasn't
especially concerned, so...

14:05.110 --> 14:07.512
He says that I probably
won't get a subpoena,

14:07.679 --> 14:09.348
but what if I do?

14:09.514 --> 14:12.184
I mean, I would have to answer
questions about him under oath.

14:12.317 --> 14:14.019
It's unthinkable.

14:15.887 --> 14:17.889
I got a subpoena.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.327
I've been meaning to mention it.
It's just...

14:23.628 --> 14:25.530
(sighs)

14:25.664 --> 14:28.333
("We Wish You a Merry
Christmas" plays over speakers)

14:28.467 --> 14:30.702
What? When?

14:30.835 --> 14:32.071
A week or so go.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.405
Well, why haven't you told me?

14:33.538 --> 14:34.906
Well, because I knew
you would lose it.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.641
Yeah, I'm gonna lose it

14:36.741 --> 14:38.510
because I'm on a witness list,
and you got a subpoena.

14:38.643 --> 14:39.911
It's probably about Kathleen.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.380
What does that mean-- probably?

14:41.513 --> 14:42.747
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a lawyer.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.216
I hope it's about her,

14:44.383 --> 14:45.750
but what if they ask
about the other women?

14:45.884 --> 14:47.719
What if they ask about you?

14:47.886 --> 14:50.022
Well, what would you say?

14:50.155 --> 14:51.356
I can't commit perjury.

14:51.490 --> 14:52.424
-Linda.
-Look,

14:52.557 --> 14:54.259
it's a hypothetical.
I mean...

14:54.393 --> 14:56.328
No.
Listen.

14:56.428 --> 14:59.198
Promise me, please,

14:59.331 --> 15:01.233
if-if...
if they ask you anything,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.235
you just say, "I don't know.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.070
I don't recall."

15:06.071 --> 15:07.606
-That is a crime, Monica.
-I promised him

15:07.739 --> 15:10.075
-that I wouldn't tell anybody.
-Monica,

15:10.209 --> 15:11.243
you are asking me
to commit a crime.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.677
-It's not lying, Linda.
-And also,

15:12.777 --> 15:13.912
this isn't only happening
to you.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.914
It is also happening to me.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.216
I'm a single mother.

15:17.349 --> 15:18.583
I'm a political appointee.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.952
I have to be careful.

15:22.421 --> 15:26.091
Anyway, I'm behind on my gifts.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.593
We-we should just get
to Macy's.

15:28.727 --> 15:31.430
I get so overwhelmed
this time of year.

15:34.433 --> 15:37.269
(indistinct chatter)

15:39.471 --> 15:42.941
(instrumental of "O
Christmas Tree" plays over P.A.)

15:43.075 --> 15:44.743
-(gasps) Mama!
-DELMER: Oh.

15:44.876 --> 15:46.245
Oh, my God!

15:46.378 --> 15:48.947
-(laughs)
-Oh. Oh, my goodness.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.283
-Oh, Mama.
-My little Minnie Mouse.

15:51.416 --> 15:53.885
Come, honey.
Oh. Oh.

15:53.985 --> 15:55.620
-Mmm.
-Oh, look at you.

15:55.754 --> 15:57.656
Oh, my Lord.
Look at those nails.

15:57.789 --> 16:00.292
-Oh. Susie took me
to get 'em done.
-Oh.

16:00.425 --> 16:02.961
-Mama, this is Susie.
-Susan Carpenter-McMillan.

16:03.095 --> 16:06.631
I have heard so much about you.

16:06.798 --> 16:08.567
Um, Susie is helping me
with my case

16:08.667 --> 16:10.802
-and my publicity and all that.
-Oh.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.971
And we stay at her house
in San Marino.

16:13.105 --> 16:15.074
-I wish you could come see it.
-Oh.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.242
She has a person
who just looks after her roses.

16:17.342 --> 16:19.311
-Oh.
-California?

16:19.444 --> 16:21.180
Oh, honey,
it took everything out of me

16:21.313 --> 16:22.581
to drive down here today. I...

16:22.681 --> 16:26.418
Just so you know,
Lonoke is a half hour from here.

16:26.518 --> 16:29.020
On Interstate 40. You know,
I hate driving that thing,

16:29.154 --> 16:30.189
but I will to see my Paula.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.824
Oh, Mama. Mama.

16:32.957 --> 16:36.661
You know, I-I'm confused
what's happening now.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.663
-Is the trial starting?
-No.

16:38.797 --> 16:40.199
-Okay.
-No. I told you.

16:40.332 --> 16:43.502
I'm doing my deposition,
and that's before the trial,

16:43.668 --> 16:47.206
uh, where you go and say
everything that happened.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.941
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, you know,
your sister told me

16:50.041 --> 16:53.011
-you got offered money
to settle.
-Yes, they did

16:53.145 --> 16:56.148
try to throw a check at us
to make this all go away,

16:56.281 --> 16:58.117
but any settlement needs

16:58.217 --> 17:01.353
to start with an apology
to our Paula.

17:05.957 --> 17:08.560
You know what?

17:08.693 --> 17:10.195
I'm gonna go check us
into the restaurant.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.630
(both laugh)

17:11.730 --> 17:13.198
Can't wait
to hear what this one was like

17:13.332 --> 17:14.466
when she was a little girl.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.034
-Oh.
-Paula Poo.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.403
(laughs)

17:19.471 --> 17:24.309
I heard that...
that they offered you $700,000.

17:24.409 --> 17:26.911
-Is that true?
-Mm-hmm.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.413
Gosh, that's a lot of money.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.350
I know,
but Susie and Steve thought

17:31.483 --> 17:33.218
that it wouldn't be right
if I took it.

17:33.352 --> 17:36.188
Look, Paula,
how are you staying here?

17:36.321 --> 17:38.223
Who's paying for all this?

17:38.390 --> 17:40.359
Well, Susie has some
really powerful friends.

17:40.492 --> 17:43.262
-Oh, I bet.
-And they got me a new lawyer
and everything.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.063
I'm worried about you.

17:45.197 --> 17:47.166
I mean, you're gonna be going
into that courthouse,

17:47.266 --> 17:49.334
and they're gonna
be asking you questions.

17:49.434 --> 17:51.336
I'm gonna be okay, Mama.

17:51.436 --> 17:53.705
I got people looking out for me.

17:53.838 --> 17:57.376
Paula, Mama?
They're ready.

17:57.509 --> 18:00.379
Do just watch out for her.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.248
Okay.

18:04.449 --> 18:07.051
-PAULA: Oh, I love it.
-Ah, ready, girls.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.953
-PAULA: Let's go to lunch.
-All right.

18:09.087 --> 18:10.455
PAULA:
I'm gonna have the Cobb salad.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.923
(Delmer laughs)

18:29.641 --> 18:31.710
*

18:37.616 --> 18:39.451
(Beverly inhales deeply)

18:43.755 --> 18:46.090
Hello, ma'am.
Sorry to disturb you.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.126
Does your name happen
to be Juanita Broaddrick?

18:48.260 --> 18:49.961
Yeah.
What is this about?

18:50.094 --> 18:52.597
I'm Beverly Lambert.
This is my husband Rick.

18:52.731 --> 18:54.399
We're private investigators
working with the attorneys

18:54.499 --> 18:55.900
representing Paula Jones.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.770
I-I'm sorry.
I don't want to be involved.

18:58.903 --> 19:01.005
Oh, well, ma'am, to explain,
we're interviewing women

19:01.139 --> 19:02.474
who've had encounters
similar to Paula's.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.343
I don't want to participate.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.345
I can certainly understand
your hesitation.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.179
There's a rumor of what occurred
with you and the president.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.315
-I know what's out there.
-Is it true?

19:10.449 --> 19:12.317
It's the past.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.519
I don't want to relive it.
I'm sorry.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.855
Okay. It's just,
Rick and I have been praying

19:16.988 --> 19:18.857
the Lord would send us
to the right people.

19:18.990 --> 19:22.461
We've been on this
awhile now, so...

19:22.594 --> 19:24.963
Are you a Christian, ma'am?

19:25.096 --> 19:27.499
-Yeah.
-So is Paula Jones.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.669
And all of her attorneys.
Good Christian men.

19:31.836 --> 19:34.706
Well, I hope
y'all find what you need,

19:34.839 --> 19:36.708
but it won't be me.

19:36.841 --> 19:38.810
Okay, all right.
I do need to tell you,

19:38.943 --> 19:40.379
if you don't talk
with me and Bev here,

19:40.512 --> 19:42.681
then those attorneys
will subpoena you.

19:42.814 --> 19:45.016
Do you understand that?

19:47.852 --> 19:50.689
They can speak to my lawyer.

19:50.855 --> 19:53.191
He'll say "no"
just like I'm saying "no."

19:53.358 --> 19:55.126
I have been a businesswoman
here for years.

19:55.226 --> 19:57.195
I do not want my name
tied up in this.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.731
So wouldn't it be easier
just to talk with us,

19:59.864 --> 20:02.367
here in the quiet?

20:02.501 --> 20:06.204
We drove all the way
from Dallas today.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.874
I wish I could be of more help.
I'm sorry.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.811
All right, then.

20:12.911 --> 20:14.879
If you change your mind at all.

20:16.581 --> 20:19.884
Just would ask
that you pray on it.

20:27.225 --> 20:30.161
One thing I will say.

20:30.261 --> 20:31.730
Paula Jones?

20:31.863 --> 20:33.898
She's telling the truth.

20:34.032 --> 20:36.501
Anything she'd say bad
about him,

20:36.601 --> 20:38.370
she's telling the truth.

20:46.378 --> 20:47.579
COURT REPORTER:
Please raise

20:47.712 --> 20:48.913
your right hand.

20:49.047 --> 20:49.914
Do you swear to tell the truth,

20:50.048 --> 20:51.215
the whole truth

20:51.350 --> 20:53.552
-and nothing but the truth?
-Okay.

20:53.685 --> 20:55.520
BENNETT:
Mrs. Jones,
I don't think we've met.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.121
I'm Robert Bennett.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.590
I represent
William Jefferson Clinton.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.024
He's the president
of the United...

21:00.124 --> 21:03.061
-I know who he is.
-Okay. Uh,

21:03.194 --> 21:06.598
you've testified that, uh,
Mr. Clinton exposed his penis

21:06.731 --> 21:08.767
to you in a room
at the Excelsior Hotel

21:08.900 --> 21:12.437
in May... May 8, 1991.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.773
How long were you in the room
before this happened?

21:14.906 --> 21:18.610
Probably five minutes,
maybe six.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.945
And after he exposed his penis,

21:21.112 --> 21:23.081
did Mr. Clinton require you

21:23.214 --> 21:25.384
to do anything
against your will?

21:27.552 --> 21:29.954
Well, he asked me to kiss his...

21:30.088 --> 21:31.956
Well, that wasn't my question,
Mrs. Jones.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.126
Did he require you to do
anything against your will?

21:35.259 --> 21:36.795
Well, he tried to kiss me.

21:36.961 --> 21:39.631
-Did he force you to kiss him?
-No.

21:39.764 --> 21:41.065
Did he force you
to kiss his penis?

21:41.165 --> 21:42.266
No.
He asked.

21:42.401 --> 21:43.602
Well, did you kiss his penis?

21:43.735 --> 21:46.304
No.
I wouldn't.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.942
Uh, you filed an affidavit
claiming that

21:51.075 --> 21:54.413
President Clinton's penis has
a distinguishing characteristic.

21:54.513 --> 21:55.980
Is that correct?

21:56.114 --> 21:59.851
Yes. Um, it's got sort of a...
a U-turn in it.

21:59.984 --> 22:02.120
Oh, you also made a statement
that, uh,

22:02.253 --> 22:03.822
the president's penis is small.

22:03.988 --> 22:07.492
Have you ever taken
an anatomy course, Mrs. Jones?

22:07.659 --> 22:10.128
No, I haven't.

22:10.261 --> 22:12.330
And your husband,
Steven Jones-- was he

22:12.497 --> 22:14.933
your first sexual partner?

22:16.334 --> 22:17.969
No.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.840
So I'm left to gather
that your ability

22:22.006 --> 22:24.476
to tell whether a man's penis
is small or large is based

22:24.609 --> 22:27.178
on opportunities you've had
to view other male penises.

22:27.311 --> 22:28.780
Is that correct?

22:31.349 --> 22:33.785
Well, uh, yes.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.857
-Okay.
-(clears throat)

22:39.023 --> 22:42.326
Ms. Jones, do you know a man
named Dennis Kirkland?

22:42.461 --> 22:44.228
Yeah, I know Dennis.

22:44.362 --> 22:46.330
-Uh, he's from Lonoke.
-Mr. Kirkland

22:46.465 --> 22:48.867
has stated under oath
that you gave him oral sex

22:49.000 --> 22:51.803
and had sex with him at a party
in 1987. Is that true?

22:54.973 --> 22:56.508
Mrs. Jones,
this is a deposition.

22:56.641 --> 22:58.176
You're required
to answer these questions.

22:58.309 --> 23:01.379
Did you provide oral sex and
engage in sex with Mr. Kirkland?

23:01.513 --> 23:03.548
No. I...
With Dennis, no, I did not.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.650
Mr. Kirkland also states
that on the same night

23:05.750 --> 23:07.418
that you provided oral sex
to him,

23:07.552 --> 23:09.387
he watched
as you provided oral sex

23:09.521 --> 23:10.722
to three other men.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.356
-Is that correct?
-What?

23:12.491 --> 23:14.392
At a party,
did you give oral sex

23:14.559 --> 23:16.060
to Dennis Kirkland
and then again

23:16.194 --> 23:18.663
to three other men
as Mr. Kirkland has affirmed

23:18.763 --> 23:19.998
under oath?

23:20.098 --> 23:21.533
No.
Why would Dennis say that?

23:21.666 --> 23:23.702
Well, I have the names of
three men right here, Ms. Jones.

23:23.835 --> 23:27.205
Uh, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

23:27.338 --> 23:30.575
I-I swear.
I swear I did not do that.

23:30.709 --> 23:35.514
I swear. How are they allowed
to say that? That is a lie.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.522
You have no idea
what all they said.

23:43.622 --> 23:46.591
It was horrible, and they acted
like it was true, and...

23:46.725 --> 23:49.460
(crying): Susie, you didn't tell
me it was gonna be like that.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.363
-You said it was gonna be okay.
-Mm. I'm sorry, Paula.

23:52.463 --> 23:54.599
Now you listen to me.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.568
These are ruthless,
terrible people,

23:56.701 --> 23:58.369
but they are not going to win.

23:58.469 --> 24:03.908
They have no idea how hard
it's about to get for him.

24:04.042 --> 24:05.910
No idea.

24:06.044 --> 24:08.079
(keys clacking)

24:10.281 --> 24:13.752
Monica Lewinsky.
You've been served.

24:38.109 --> 24:41.312
*

24:41.445 --> 24:43.314
(doorbell rings)

24:43.481 --> 24:45.483
Allison, hi.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.918
-Hey.
-Oh, wow. I love that dress.

24:47.018 --> 24:48.920
Thank you.
(laughs)

24:49.020 --> 24:51.956
* *

24:54.759 --> 24:57.095
-Oh, it means
"Merry Christmas."
-Oh.

24:57.195 --> 24:58.663
Um, can I take your coat?

24:58.797 --> 25:00.131
-Oh, yes, please.
-Okay.

25:00.264 --> 25:02.166
Wow. You guys really
go all-out, don't you?

25:02.333 --> 25:04.302
-Yeah, we do.
-Do you know where your mom is?

25:04.435 --> 25:06.337
Um... she's probably over there.

25:06.470 --> 25:08.206
-Okay. Thanks.
-Yeah. Sure.

25:08.339 --> 25:10.308
-Oh, I see her. Thanks.
-Okay. Yeah.

25:11.342 --> 25:13.177
Oh, um, excuse me.

25:13.344 --> 25:15.880
Oh, Monica?

25:16.014 --> 25:17.682
Oh, my God, you have to try
these cookies. They're so...

25:17.816 --> 25:19.450
I will. Just one second.
Sorry.

25:19.550 --> 25:21.519
-Merry Christmas.
-Oh, Willy. Hi. Merry Christmas.

25:21.686 --> 25:24.188
-Good to see you.
-Sorry. Just one second. Sorry.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.395
-(Monica sighs)
-(quiet chatter)

25:31.529 --> 25:33.364
-Hi. Yeah.
-Oh, hi there.

25:33.497 --> 25:34.699
-Merry Christmas.
-Oh.

25:34.833 --> 25:37.969
I love pine. Thank you.
You're too much.

25:38.069 --> 25:41.539
Cathy, this is my, uh...
my good friend Monica.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.507
If you want to talk
about the fiasco

25:43.642 --> 25:45.710
that's DLA's electronic
acquisition system,

25:45.877 --> 25:47.078
park yourself next to Monica.

25:47.211 --> 25:48.880
She works with me at DoD.

25:49.013 --> 25:50.381
-She's been in the trenches.
-So nice to meet you.

25:50.548 --> 25:52.316
Cathy's in my bridge group.
She-she works

25:52.416 --> 25:53.685
in ground-based missile defense.

25:53.818 --> 25:55.519
Can we speak privately
for a moment?

25:55.654 --> 25:57.889
-Not right now.
-I really, really need
to talk to you.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.891
-I'm hosting a party.
-Uh, Monica.

26:00.058 --> 26:03.561
Oh, Ken. Can you believe
these two came?

26:03.695 --> 26:05.063
KEN:
Oh, well, we were just thrilled

26:05.229 --> 26:06.530
that we could finally
make it this year.

26:06.665 --> 26:08.432
But now,
can you please tell us

26:08.566 --> 26:10.902
all about your wonderful
Christmas village in there?

26:11.069 --> 26:12.403
Of course. Do you want
the three-hour version,

26:12.570 --> 26:14.405
-or just the two?
-Well...

26:14.572 --> 26:16.941
-(laughter)
-LINDA: Yeah. Come on. Come on.

26:20.912 --> 26:23.281
Well...

26:23.414 --> 26:25.750
it all starts here.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.752
I got this when I was girl

26:27.919 --> 26:29.921
on my first ever trip
to Frankfurt

26:30.054 --> 26:31.956
to meet my mother's family.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.092
They took me
to a darling Christmas shop

26:34.225 --> 26:35.894
that sold
hand-carved miniatures,

26:36.027 --> 26:38.262
and I saw this
little snow-dusted fir,

26:38.396 --> 26:40.598
-and I was captivated.
-(overlapping chatter)

26:40.765 --> 26:42.767
-KEN: Oh, it's beautiful.
-LINDA: My dream is to

26:42.934 --> 26:44.769
one day open my own shop
like that.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.271
A place where it's Christmas
all year round.

26:47.438 --> 26:49.107
It would fill
a real need, and...

26:49.240 --> 26:51.442
Oh.

26:51.575 --> 26:53.077
(laughs)
I see Richard's

26:53.211 --> 26:54.946
discovered my newest
Weihnachtspyramide.

26:55.079 --> 26:56.580
(Ken chuckles)

26:56.715 --> 26:58.082
LINDA:
Aren't they beautiful?

26:58.216 --> 26:59.450
This one belonged to my mother.

26:59.583 --> 27:01.285
She brought it all the way
from Germany.

27:01.419 --> 27:03.121
With my father in tow.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.556
-(laughter)
-And so, uh, do you know

27:05.656 --> 27:06.791
what the Weihnachtspyramide is?

27:06.958 --> 27:09.460
It's the original
Christmas pyramid.

27:09.593 --> 27:10.594
(distorted chatter)

27:10.729 --> 27:12.463
LINDA:
...seasonal miniatures.

27:12.630 --> 27:15.166
-*
-(continues indistinctly)

27:15.299 --> 27:17.468
* Oh, how they pound,
raising the sound *

27:17.635 --> 27:19.470
* O'er hill and dale,
telling their tale *

27:19.637 --> 27:21.840
* Gaily they ring
while people sing *

27:21.973 --> 27:24.142
* Songs of good cheer,
Christmas is here *

27:24.308 --> 27:26.144
* Merry, merry, merry,
merry Christmas... *

27:26.277 --> 27:28.813
LINDA:
Take his keys. (chuckles)

27:28.980 --> 27:31.816
-Thank you.
-Can you please talk to me?

27:31.983 --> 27:33.985
One minute. Let me get Helen
my stollen recipe.

27:34.152 --> 27:35.119
Linda!

27:35.253 --> 27:36.154
(whispers):
I got the subpoena.

27:36.320 --> 27:39.323
Your cheese log is so creamy.

27:39.490 --> 27:40.925
Not now, Susan.

27:41.025 --> 27:42.794
* It is to ride *

27:42.927 --> 27:45.329
* In a one-horse
open sleigh... *

27:45.496 --> 27:48.299
I'll walk you to your car.

27:48.432 --> 27:50.201
"You are commanded to appear
in the United States..."

27:50.334 --> 27:52.971
Oh.
This is incredibly alarming.

27:53.104 --> 27:55.639
I know, but I've been thinking
this might actually help you.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.441
What? Why?

27:57.541 --> 27:59.343
You've been so worried
about them asking you

27:59.477 --> 28:00.845
about me and Bill, and-and now,

28:00.979 --> 28:02.213
I'll have already said
that nothing happened,

28:02.346 --> 28:03.647
so you can just say
the same thing.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.850
It's so detailed.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.852
The hat pin?

28:08.019 --> 28:09.620
They have intel.

28:09.720 --> 28:12.656
The only people that know are
my closest friends, my mom--

28:12.791 --> 28:14.725
but she doesn't even know
any details--

28:14.859 --> 28:16.527
and-and Bill and you.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.529
Well, Monica, somebody
has told them something.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.231
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

28:20.364 --> 28:22.400
You think I haven't been
torturing myself about that?

28:22.533 --> 28:24.535
That I haven't fucking
stopped thinking about that?

28:24.702 --> 28:27.906
But I am going to deny it,
and it'll be over, okay?

28:28.039 --> 28:29.874
So I'm gonna sign
that affidavit tomorrow,

28:30.041 --> 28:32.376
and you are gonna sign one
that matches mine,

28:32.510 --> 28:34.745
and then we're both
gonna be off the hook.

28:36.547 --> 28:38.549
Hello?

28:40.384 --> 28:42.686
I can't believe
it's almost over.

28:42.821 --> 28:45.056
What?

28:45.223 --> 28:47.826
Christmas.

28:47.926 --> 28:51.896
The closer you get,
the nearer you are to the end.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.866
Hmm.

28:54.999 --> 28:58.036
(panting)

29:02.740 --> 29:04.575
I should get back.

29:04.742 --> 29:06.945
Susan has probably consumed
my entire cheese log.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.612
Inviting her was a misstep.

29:08.746 --> 29:11.215
-Linda, please.
-I understand
that you're worried.

29:11.349 --> 29:13.384
I am worried, too.

29:13.517 --> 29:17.121
But I need to talk to my lawyer
before I do anything.

29:21.292 --> 29:23.594
Merry Christmas, Monica.

29:29.233 --> 29:30.734
(door closes)

29:35.273 --> 29:36.607
VERNON:
Did you tell the president

29:36.740 --> 29:38.776
-about this?
-I couldn't reach him.

29:40.644 --> 29:42.546
Okay, here's the deal.

29:42.646 --> 29:45.449
They're probably going to focus
on two questions.

29:45.616 --> 29:47.952
Did you have sex
with the president?

29:51.890 --> 29:53.791
No.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.459
Did he ever ask for it?

29:57.295 --> 30:00.398
Then I don't see any cause
for alarm.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.800
You'll just submit an affidavit
saying nothing happened,

30:02.934 --> 30:04.969
and they won't make you
testify in person.

30:05.136 --> 30:07.105
But how did they
even know my name?

30:07.238 --> 30:08.973
And on page three,
it says to turn over

30:09.140 --> 30:11.175
anything he's given you,
including hat pins.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.344
How could they have known
that he gave me a hat pin?

30:13.477 --> 30:16.280
Frank Carter is a great lawyer.

30:16.414 --> 30:17.748
I'll introduce you.

30:17.848 --> 30:20.518
He'll help you
with the affidavit.

30:20.651 --> 30:22.753
Can you please
tell the president about this?

30:22.853 --> 30:25.656
Yeah, I'll make sure he knows,
but, Monica,

30:25.789 --> 30:27.658
you'll be okay.

30:27.825 --> 30:29.827
CARTER:
So,

30:29.994 --> 30:32.163
by signing this,
you're affirming under oath

30:32.296 --> 30:35.199
that you can think of no reason
why the plaintiff, Paula Jones,

30:35.333 --> 30:36.800
would seek information from you,

30:36.935 --> 30:39.003
and that you've never
had a sexual relationship

30:39.137 --> 30:40.504
with President Clinton.

30:40.671 --> 30:42.673
-That's right.
-Good.

30:43.674 --> 30:46.277
John Hancock right here.

31:01.292 --> 31:05.329
Wow. Wonder what this is.
(laughs)

31:05.463 --> 31:07.798
-Oh, I actually needed
one of these.
-Ooh.

31:07.898 --> 31:09.467
I needed one of these.

31:09.567 --> 31:10.834
ALLISON:
You do, because
you really need to practice.

31:10.969 --> 31:12.236
-You're really, um...
-Okay.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.571
ALLISON:
You suck at basketball.

31:13.704 --> 31:15.039
RYAN:
You never even watch me play.

31:15.173 --> 31:16.374
-ALLISON: Oh, my gosh.
-Not at all.

31:16.540 --> 31:17.976
-I'm way better than you.
-Are you kidding me?

31:18.076 --> 31:19.377
-(phone ringing)
-ALLISON: Oh,
this is really cute.

31:19.510 --> 31:20.711
-I like this.
-RYAN: Yeah, it is cute.

31:20.878 --> 31:22.013
-ALLISON: Right? Isn't it?
-Yeah, very cute.

31:22.146 --> 31:25.349
(ringing continues)

31:25.483 --> 31:26.817
ALLISON:
Yes.

31:26.917 --> 31:28.886
(chatter continues indistinctly)

31:38.229 --> 31:40.231
(ringing continues)

31:40.364 --> 31:43.534
LINDA:
Hi. You've reached the home of
Linda, Ryan And Allison Tripp.

31:43.667 --> 31:45.169
We're not available
to take your call.

31:45.269 --> 31:47.171
Please leave a message.

31:47.271 --> 31:48.572
-(beeps)
-Hey.

31:48.706 --> 31:51.242
I just wanted to say
Merry Christmas, and, um,

31:51.375 --> 31:54.045
I just... I just want to talk

31:54.178 --> 31:56.580
about everything.

31:56.714 --> 31:58.116
*

31:58.249 --> 31:59.783
And, uh...

31:59.917 --> 32:02.220
see if you made a decision.

32:02.353 --> 32:05.689
Okay, uh, please just...

32:05.789 --> 32:08.926
just call me any time.

32:09.060 --> 32:11.095
TORE SANTA (on TV):S
ou'll shoot your eye out, kid.Y

32:11.229 --> 32:12.963
Merry Christmas.

32:13.097 --> 32:16.300
Ho, ho, ho.

32:22.373 --> 32:25.609
KEN BACON:
Monica, you traversed the globe
with our team.

32:25.776 --> 32:28.246
You worked all hours,
you did a great job,

32:28.379 --> 32:30.148
and you certainly have
the best fashion sense

32:30.281 --> 32:33.284
that an Air Force C-40 aircraft
has ever seen, right?

32:33.451 --> 32:34.752
(laughter)

32:34.885 --> 32:37.455
The folks at Revlon
don't know how lucky they are.

32:37.588 --> 32:41.092
We're sure gonna miss
your kindness,

32:41.225 --> 32:44.795
your keen intelligence
and your bright spirit.

32:44.962 --> 32:46.964
Good luck in the Big Apple,
Monica.

32:47.098 --> 32:48.466
Don't forget your friends
at the DoD

32:48.632 --> 32:50.434
who care about you very much.

32:50.568 --> 32:53.304
(applause)

32:55.639 --> 32:57.508
Excuse me, sir.
Just one second.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.184
Hey.
Can you call me back?

33:06.317 --> 33:07.651
Yes, of course.

33:07.818 --> 33:09.320
'Cause I've been trying you
and trying you.

33:09.487 --> 33:10.754
I know.
I'm sorry.

33:10.854 --> 33:12.456
(whispering):
What is your plan?

33:12.590 --> 33:14.125
We can talk about
all of this later.

33:14.258 --> 33:16.127
I'm actually meeting
with my lawyer today.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.796
Okay, good.
That's good, right?

33:18.929 --> 33:21.132
You know, we don't have
a picture together.

33:21.265 --> 33:23.267
You hate
having your photo taken.

33:23.367 --> 33:26.170
I know, but you're leaving.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.638
Can't believe it.

33:27.771 --> 33:29.340
Nathan?

33:31.342 --> 33:32.676
Okay, ladies.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.845
(camera shutter clicks)

33:35.012 --> 33:37.014
(camera winding)

33:38.216 --> 33:40.017
(camera shutter clicks)

33:50.394 --> 33:53.131
-Linda, please.
-(door closes)

33:53.231 --> 33:54.532
So, your subpoena.

33:54.665 --> 33:56.033
I can help you draft
an affidavit

33:56.167 --> 33:57.468
so you won't have to testify.

33:57.568 --> 33:58.869
I mean, you have no connection

33:59.002 --> 34:00.504
to Paula Jones or the president.

34:00.638 --> 34:02.473
You're entirely wrong.
I'm quite close

34:02.573 --> 34:05.743
to a woman in the midst of an
affair with President Clinton.

34:05.876 --> 34:07.845
And he's covering it up

34:07.978 --> 34:10.514
by getting her a job at Revlon.

34:12.716 --> 34:14.385
Her name is Monica.

34:14.552 --> 34:16.387
And the Jones lawyers know this.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.888
They know I know things.

34:18.055 --> 34:19.757
(scoffs)

34:23.894 --> 34:27.030
I'd like to give these to you.
For safekeeping.

34:27.165 --> 34:29.933
My calls with Monica.

34:30.067 --> 34:32.403
KIRBY:
You've been taping her.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.338
And does she know?

34:34.438 --> 34:36.340
No, she had no idea.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.243
-Where were you
calling her from?
-My house in Columbia.

34:39.410 --> 34:41.245
Linda, that's a felony.

34:43.013 --> 34:45.416
-What?
-You cannot

34:45.549 --> 34:47.551
secretly tape phone calls
in Maryland.

34:47.685 --> 34:50.020
It's a two-party consent state.

34:53.357 --> 34:55.226
I was told it was fine.

34:55.359 --> 34:57.728
-By who?
-My literary agent.

34:57.861 --> 35:01.765
I'm your lawyer.
Why didn't you ask me?

35:01.899 --> 35:03.767
All right, all right, look,

35:03.901 --> 35:05.135
here's what we're gonna do,
okay?

35:05.269 --> 35:06.604
I-I'm gonna call Bob Bennett.

35:06.770 --> 35:08.105
Ugh. (laughs airily)

35:08.239 --> 35:10.274
I know you're not a fan,
but he's a reasonable guy.

35:10.408 --> 35:11.775
-Oh, yeah.
-I'm gonna tell him about this,

35:11.909 --> 35:14.278
and push him to settle now
with Paula Jones.

35:14.445 --> 35:16.580
-No, I don't want that.
-Linda, do you understand

35:16.714 --> 35:18.282
how much trouble you're in?

35:18.416 --> 35:20.484
If these tapes are introduced
into evidence,

35:20.618 --> 35:23.120
you will be prosecuted,
you could go to jail.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.455
(gasps)

35:24.622 --> 35:27.124
You said taping phone calls
was entirely fine.

35:27.291 --> 35:28.492
LUCIANNE:
Well, it is in New York.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.127
Well, not everyone lives
in New York.

35:30.261 --> 35:31.929
(laughing):
Yes, I never understand that.

35:32.062 --> 35:33.497
This is serious.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.299
I could go to prison.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.901
-I could lose everything.
-Okay.

35:38.001 --> 35:40.304
What does your lawyer say to do?

35:40.471 --> 35:42.606
He wants to tell Bob Bennett
about the tapes.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.308
What?

35:44.442 --> 35:47.077
So he'll settle,
so they won't come to light.

35:47.177 --> 35:49.613
If this case gets killed,
he gets away with all of it.

35:49.747 --> 35:51.649
I don't want that, either,

35:51.782 --> 35:55.152
but Maryland has a Democrat for
governor and attorney general.

35:55.319 --> 35:58.121
The White House will have no
trouble sending them after me.

35:58.256 --> 35:59.657
Maximum sentence.

35:59.823 --> 36:02.025
Linda, calm down.
We just need to figure out a way

36:02.159 --> 36:04.262
to get you immunity
from prosecution.

36:04.362 --> 36:05.863
How are we gonna do that?

36:05.996 --> 36:08.131
I have an idea.
Let me get my Rolodex.

36:08.266 --> 36:10.468
(sighs)

36:12.002 --> 36:13.637
(phone ringing)

36:13.771 --> 36:15.339
Conway.

36:15.473 --> 36:16.507
Do you have connections

36:16.640 --> 36:18.509
-to Ken Starr's office?
-Of course I do.

36:18.642 --> 36:21.512
We need to make them aware of
Linda Tripp as fast as we can.

36:21.645 --> 36:23.046
(knocking)

36:26.183 --> 36:27.351
Hey, stranger.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.052
-MONICA: Hey.
-(door closes)

36:29.186 --> 36:30.854
(Monica sighs)

36:30.988 --> 36:32.656
When's the big move?

36:34.024 --> 36:35.993
Next week.

36:36.126 --> 36:37.194
You okay?

36:37.361 --> 36:39.363
Yeah.

36:39.497 --> 36:40.831
Yeah.
No, I'm fine.

36:40.964 --> 36:43.534
I got you a few things.

36:44.735 --> 36:48.171
For the new New Yorker.

36:52.876 --> 36:55.078
Wow.
That's, um...

36:55.212 --> 36:57.247
That's very sweet.
Thank you, but I, um...

36:57.381 --> 36:59.383
Hold on.
We're not done.

37:00.518 --> 37:03.554
Oh, my God.
I love him, um,

37:03.687 --> 37:06.424
-but I...
-And the last

37:06.557 --> 37:08.225
but not least.

37:14.898 --> 37:17.601
I found this in Vancouver

37:17.735 --> 37:20.371
in a First Nation store.

37:20.504 --> 37:22.773
You know,
a bear symbolizes courage.

37:22.906 --> 37:27.411
So in your new life up there
in the big city,

37:27.578 --> 37:31.181
when you need to be strong,
just hold him close.

37:32.683 --> 37:34.251
You okay?

37:34.418 --> 37:36.253
I... I...

37:36.420 --> 37:38.255
I love them.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.391
Really, I love them,
but I can't take them.

37:40.524 --> 37:42.393
My subpoena asked for
every gift you've ever given me,

37:42.526 --> 37:43.761
and it just feels too dangerous.

37:43.927 --> 37:45.195
Well, d-don't worry about that.

37:45.295 --> 37:46.930
I am worried.

37:47.064 --> 37:49.367
Don't you think that
something weird is going on?

37:49.467 --> 37:52.570
I wish I did.
I'm sorry you're having

37:52.703 --> 37:55.939
to experience it, but, uh,
this is what they do to me

37:56.106 --> 37:58.275
and anyone I'm close to.

37:58.442 --> 38:02.079
You know, sad thing is,
just feels normal to me now.

38:02.212 --> 38:05.148
Okay. I just... I guess
it feels different for me.

38:05.282 --> 38:07.451
I don't know.
I just keep thinking

38:07.618 --> 38:10.754
about the witness list and
the subpoena and the hat pin...

38:10.888 --> 38:12.823
You'll be okay.

38:13.924 --> 38:15.959
I mean, you signed
the affidavit, right?

38:18.796 --> 38:21.632
And, uh...

38:21.765 --> 38:23.634
no one knows about us.

38:23.767 --> 38:26.804
Right.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.839
And your friend
at the Pentagon--

38:28.972 --> 38:31.642
she doesn't know?

38:33.644 --> 38:34.978
No.

38:36.647 --> 38:40.150
She's not really my friend
anymore anyway.

38:40.317 --> 38:42.586
So you got nothing
to worry about.

38:45.188 --> 38:47.591
This I do know.

38:47.691 --> 38:50.494
You are gonna do great
in New York.

38:50.628 --> 38:53.464
You know, building a career,

38:53.597 --> 38:55.766
making new friends,

38:55.866 --> 38:59.670
lighting up every life
you walk into like you did mine.

39:07.177 --> 39:10.047
-(sighs)
-And one day, you'll look back
on all this and laugh.

39:10.180 --> 39:13.551
I'll be some crazy story
you tell your grandkids.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.686
-You're more than a crazy story.
-(knocking)

39:15.853 --> 39:18.689
Mr. President,
Prime Minister Blair.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.190
Yeah, I'll just be a moment.

39:20.357 --> 39:22.860
-There's never enough time.
-(door closes)

39:24.027 --> 39:25.729
Safe travels, Monica.

39:32.169 --> 39:35.573
I'll never, um,
be in this room again.

39:37.708 --> 39:40.578
I'll, uh... I'll call you next
week once you're settled in.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.045
Will you really call me?

39:42.179 --> 39:44.381
Of course, middle of next week.

39:47.050 --> 39:50.387
(sighs) I know
I shouldn't say this, and...

39:52.189 --> 39:54.224
But I...

39:54.391 --> 39:58.161
I need you to know that...

39:58.261 --> 40:01.364
you are my whole world.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.878
Good luck in New York.

40:15.012 --> 40:17.180
Be good.

40:19.850 --> 40:21.585
(Monica sniffles)

40:22.586 --> 40:24.622
(knocking)

40:34.932 --> 40:36.934
(sighs)

40:41.304 --> 40:43.373
(door closes)

40:50.480 --> 40:51.882
(elevator bell dings)

40:55.318 --> 40:57.054
Sorry.

40:59.456 --> 41:01.391
Clinton has a mistress.

41:01.491 --> 41:03.627
She-She's an intern
or she was an intern.

41:03.761 --> 41:05.128
They moved her to the Pentagon,

41:05.262 --> 41:07.798
but Vernon Jordan got her a job
at Revlon for perjury.

41:07.965 --> 41:10.668
-What?
-I just had dinner
with friends from law school.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.335
They said that
Clinton was fucking a girl

41:12.469 --> 41:13.937
who worked for him.

41:14.071 --> 41:15.806
There's perjury,
there's a cover-up.

41:15.939 --> 41:17.941
And, Jackie, there are tapes.

41:18.075 --> 41:19.309
STARR:
You're telling me

41:19.442 --> 41:21.144
these tapes have this young lady

41:21.278 --> 41:23.581
explicitly stating
that the president

41:23.681 --> 41:25.649
had Vernon Jordan
give her a job

41:25.783 --> 41:28.619
in exchange for lying
in an affidavit?

41:28.752 --> 41:30.153
Yes, lying about the affair.

41:30.287 --> 41:31.689
-Judge, they had sex
in the Oval Office.
-Okay.

41:31.822 --> 41:33.256
-I don't need to hear that.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41:33.356 --> 41:34.758
We need to talk to this witness.

41:34.858 --> 41:36.994
Wait. How did all this
come to you?

41:37.160 --> 41:39.763
Back channel from some friends
that have been helping

41:39.863 --> 41:42.265
Paula Jones' lawyers
behind the scenes.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.706
I see you two are very excited.

41:48.839 --> 41:51.541
But I need to figure out

41:51.675 --> 41:54.011
how I can justify this
under our mandate.

41:54.144 --> 41:56.113
(laughing):
What? What?

41:56.213 --> 41:57.615
Vernon Jordan's
the president's fixer.

41:57.715 --> 41:59.016
How many
of our Whitewater witnesses

41:59.182 --> 42:00.851
-has he interfered with?
-Allegedly.

42:00.984 --> 42:02.285
Let's just see
if it's real, Judge.

42:02.385 --> 42:04.855
We'll go
where the evidence leads.

42:07.991 --> 42:09.860
Look into it,
but remember who we are.

42:09.993 --> 42:12.830
This is a federal investigation
reporting directly

42:12.963 --> 42:15.065
to the United States Congress.

42:15.198 --> 42:17.067
No more of this backdoor stuff
with your friends.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.069
It has to appear
that this witness came

42:19.202 --> 42:20.537
to us out of the blue.

42:20.671 --> 42:22.005
She has to call us.

42:22.139 --> 42:23.874
We... Yeah, got it.
Go, go, go.

42:25.342 --> 42:26.977
(door closes)

42:27.978 --> 42:29.512
(paper crumpling)

42:29.647 --> 42:31.682
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You've got mail.

42:41.158 --> 42:43.026
(sighs)

42:43.160 --> 42:44.995
(typing)

42:45.095 --> 42:46.563
(mouse clicking)

42:46.730 --> 42:47.731
(chimes)

42:51.702 --> 42:53.737
(phone ringing)

42:55.372 --> 42:56.840
Hello?

42:56.940 --> 42:59.877
Ken Starr's office
wants to hear from you.

43:00.878 --> 43:02.545
Oh.

43:02.680 --> 43:05.215
-Okay.
-Listen.

43:05.348 --> 43:07.250
You know this isn't
some dinky little subpoena

43:07.417 --> 43:09.252
in this sexual harassment suit.

43:09.419 --> 43:13.090
his is a prosecutorT
ith the power to file charges,w

43:13.223 --> 43:14.758
and the FBI on their side.

43:14.892 --> 43:17.560
He'll be expecting
your call tonight,

43:17.695 --> 43:20.563
but, Linda,
the second you call them,

43:20.698 --> 43:22.933
this all turns
into something else.

43:27.805 --> 43:29.873
(dialing)

43:31.374 --> 43:33.376
(line ringing)

43:34.377 --> 43:36.413
JACKIE:
OIC. This is Jackie Bennett.

43:37.380 --> 43:39.116
It's me.

44:09.179 --> 44:11.248
*

44:24.427 --> 44:26.830
Linda Tripp.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.766
Jackie Bennett.
We spoke on the phone.

44:28.866 --> 44:31.334
My colleagues-- Sol Wisenberg,
Mike Emmick--

44:31.468 --> 44:33.336
from the Office
of the Independent Counsel.

44:33.470 --> 44:35.172
This is
Special Agent Steve Irons.

44:35.338 --> 44:37.640
-FBI.
-May we come in?
-Please.

44:39.609 --> 44:41.478
JACKIE:
So,

44:41.611 --> 44:44.381
-you called us?
-I'm in a terrible situation.

44:44.514 --> 44:47.684
Facing prison or worse.
(scoffs)

44:47.851 --> 44:52.489
All because I borne witness
to a series of ongoing crimes.

44:52.622 --> 44:55.325
-What crimes?
-Were you not all briefed?

44:56.493 --> 44:59.562
I assumed
you'd all come briefed.

45:00.630 --> 45:03.366
Well, please sit.

45:03.500 --> 45:07.871
Uh, in short, I've been
subpoenaed in the Jones suit,

45:08.005 --> 45:12.642
and I'm being pressured
into a... a cover-up

45:12.742 --> 45:16.046
at the direction of the
president of the United States.

45:16.213 --> 45:19.049
Just to confirm-- this involves
your colleague Monica...

45:19.182 --> 45:22.052
Lewinsky.
A friend.

45:22.185 --> 45:24.221
A good friend.

45:25.222 --> 45:28.058
It's not simply my word on this.

45:28.191 --> 45:32.395
I-I have Monica
describing it all on tape.

45:34.264 --> 45:36.666
She also discusses
her sexual affair

45:36.766 --> 45:39.536
with the president...
in detail.

45:39.669 --> 45:43.540
So you started taping
when you got the subpoena?

45:43.673 --> 45:45.375
No.

45:45.508 --> 45:47.945
I began when I was subjected
to character assassination

45:48.078 --> 45:50.113
by the president's attorney
in Newsweek.

45:51.248 --> 45:53.083
I knew I had to protect myself.

45:53.216 --> 45:55.585
-From Bob Bennett.
-From the Clintons.

45:55.752 --> 45:58.288
We all know
what they're capable of.

45:58.421 --> 46:00.390
This Monica has no idea?

46:00.523 --> 46:01.758
Of course not.

46:01.925 --> 46:03.626
And I-I'm sorry.

46:03.760 --> 46:06.096
You referred to this person
as your "good friend"?

46:06.263 --> 46:07.430
What's that supposed to mean?

46:07.597 --> 46:09.599
Well, I'm just trying
to ascertain...

46:09.732 --> 46:12.469
Well, I have been Monica's sole
support for-for over a year.

46:12.602 --> 46:15.105
I've given her my time,
my-my counsel

46:15.272 --> 46:17.607
in her darkest, loneliest hour.

46:17.740 --> 46:19.709
There was one person she knew
would pick up the phone,

46:19.809 --> 46:21.711
and that was me.

46:21.811 --> 46:25.949
All I want,
all I have ever wanted

46:26.083 --> 46:30.120
is for Monica to be okay.

46:30.253 --> 46:32.289
But I had to protect myself.

46:33.723 --> 46:35.725
And thank fucking God I did.

46:35.825 --> 46:38.261
Mrs. Tripp,
we have been investigating

46:38.395 --> 46:40.130
the Clintons for years now.

46:40.297 --> 46:41.899
Yes, we know
what they're capable of,

46:41.999 --> 46:45.435
and we fully understand
why you did what you did, okay?

46:46.569 --> 46:49.139
Now, out of nowhere,
I learn it's illegal

46:49.306 --> 46:50.807
in Maryland to record a call.

46:50.974 --> 46:52.509
-I-I got horrible advice
on that.
-Yeah.

46:52.642 --> 46:55.946
We will help you avoid
prosecution, anything you need.

46:56.079 --> 46:58.481
We just need copies
of your tapes.

47:03.921 --> 47:05.655
I can have those
to you tomorrow.

47:08.658 --> 47:10.527
Okay, great.

47:10.660 --> 47:13.964
I'll have a clean tape
for you tomorrow, too.

47:14.097 --> 47:15.933
What do you mean,
"clean tape"?

47:16.033 --> 47:18.001
I've arranged lunch with Monica

47:18.135 --> 47:20.003
tomorrow in Virginia
where they're less dictatorial

47:20.137 --> 47:21.771
about single-party taping.

47:21.871 --> 47:24.107
I'm going to tape the whole
thing, but legal this time.

47:24.207 --> 47:26.043
-And how are you gonna do that?
-I'm going to wire myself

47:26.176 --> 47:28.345
with a recording device.
I plan to wear a loose blouse.

47:28.511 --> 47:31.014
No, no, no.
No, no way.

47:31.148 --> 47:32.782
This is an active
federal investigation.

47:32.882 --> 47:35.285
If you're gonna be wired, you're
gonna be wired by the FBI.

47:39.389 --> 47:41.191
You realize what this means?

47:41.324 --> 47:44.194
Clinton gives his deposition
in the Jones case on Saturday.

47:44.361 --> 47:47.197
He's gonna walk in there,
he's gonna lie his ass off.

47:47.364 --> 47:48.865
We're gonna be waiting for him.

47:48.999 --> 47:52.202
I mean, this is...
this is bigger than Whitewater.

47:52.335 --> 47:54.371
What? Fuck that.
It's bigger than Watergate, man.

47:54.504 --> 47:56.706
-We have tapes.
-Watergate had tapes.

47:56.873 --> 47:58.908
And thank God we do, too,

47:59.042 --> 48:02.179
'cause a jury would
fucking hate that lady.

48:10.720 --> 48:12.189
Just need to secure this.

48:12.322 --> 48:14.091
How is this different
than the one on my leg?

48:14.224 --> 48:15.892
This one lets us listen live
from up here.

48:16.026 --> 48:19.562
Linda, look, just-just focus
on two things, okay?

48:19.729 --> 48:21.931
She needs to say she's planning
on lying under oath

48:22.065 --> 48:24.001
and she needs to say what
Vernon Jordan is doing for her

48:24.101 --> 48:25.735
in exchange for that lie.

48:25.902 --> 48:27.737
-That's it.
-AGENT: Okay.

48:27.870 --> 48:28.905
Ms. Tripp,
can you say a few words?

48:29.039 --> 48:30.407
What if something goes wrong?

48:30.540 --> 48:31.574
We'll be listening in
the whole time,

48:31.708 --> 48:32.742
and we have people posted
downstairs.

48:32.875 --> 48:34.111
What if she sees them?

48:34.244 --> 48:36.413
-She won't.
-(scoffs)

48:38.681 --> 48:40.750
Why don't you go for a table
in the back corner?

48:40.917 --> 48:42.252
You'll be able
to see the whole place.

48:42.419 --> 48:44.187
It'll help you stay calm.

48:47.924 --> 48:49.959
I hope I don't let you down.

49:08.978 --> 49:10.447
-Hi.
-Hi.

49:10.613 --> 49:13.150
Uh, uh...

49:13.283 --> 49:15.585
I'd like that table
in the corner.

49:15.718 --> 49:17.620
-Oh, okay.
-It'll just be two of us.

49:17.787 --> 49:19.156
Sure. Wherever you like.

49:19.289 --> 49:22.292
Tell me
about your smoking policy.

49:22.425 --> 49:24.294
Oh, this is
a nonsmoking section.

49:24.427 --> 49:25.662
Okay, well,
I don't want to do anything

49:25.795 --> 49:27.297
that's not the normal routine.

49:27.430 --> 49:29.232
-You can smoke at the bar.
-No, that's fine.

49:29.332 --> 49:30.500
There are plenty of seats
at the bar if you want...

49:30.633 --> 49:33.670
No, I don't want to go
to the bar. Thank you.

49:33.803 --> 49:35.838
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

49:35.972 --> 49:38.007
(piano music plays quietly)

49:49.186 --> 49:51.254
(sighs)

50:14.211 --> 50:15.678
Hi.

50:15.845 --> 50:17.814
Hi, Monica.

50:17.947 --> 50:19.982
-(sighs)
-It's her.

50:21.351 --> 50:23.186
LINDA:
Listen.

50:23.353 --> 50:25.788
I have been thinking
about you nonstop.

50:25.888 --> 50:28.024
I know I've been out of touch.

50:28.191 --> 50:31.494
Things feel so weird, and our
last conversation was so...

50:31.628 --> 50:33.330
I'm sorry.
I've-I've been a wreck.

50:33.463 --> 50:34.631
Me too.

50:34.731 --> 50:36.666
Why have you been a wreck?

50:36.799 --> 50:40.237
MONICA:
Because I'm in a nightmare.

50:40.370 --> 50:42.872
I feel like I'm going crazy,
like actual DSM crazy.

50:43.005 --> 50:44.507
I don't understand
what's happening or why.

50:44.641 --> 50:45.908
What do you...
what do you mean?

50:46.042 --> 50:47.810
What do you mean,
"What do I mean?"

50:47.910 --> 50:51.214
I feel an overwhelming sense of
dread every minute of every day,

50:51.348 --> 50:53.150
and honestly,
you're not helping with that.

50:53.250 --> 50:55.985
-I know. I know.
-You dropped off the face
of the earth, Linda.

50:56.085 --> 50:58.255
You were gonna go talk
to a lawyer, right?

50:58.388 --> 51:00.423
-Did that happen?
-Uh, I did,

51:00.557 --> 51:04.194
but, uh, it's-it's all still
very much up in the air.

51:04.327 --> 51:05.728
-Well, what does that mean?
-Thank you.

51:05.895 --> 51:07.730
Mm. Can I get you ladies
anything?

51:07.897 --> 51:09.566
No, nothing.
No, no.

51:09.699 --> 51:12.369
-I'd love some coffee, please.
-Mm-hmm.

51:19.776 --> 51:21.678
I need to know
what you're thinking

51:21.778 --> 51:23.546
about your affidavit.

51:23.680 --> 51:26.849
Are you still planning to lie?

51:26.949 --> 51:29.419
I already signed it.

51:29.552 --> 51:31.888
Nice.

51:32.021 --> 51:34.191
MONICA:
My thing with him was personal

51:34.291 --> 51:37.227
and private, and it has
absolutely nothing to do

51:37.360 --> 51:40.096
with Paula Jones, and I...
I really thought about it.

51:40.230 --> 51:42.799
And maybe if this were a...
a serious lawsuit,

51:42.932 --> 51:45.268
I would feel differently,
but I...

51:45.402 --> 51:48.104
I'm not helping
with a publicity stunt.

51:48.238 --> 51:50.072
I'm just... I'm not, okay?
And I think

51:50.207 --> 51:52.209
-you would feel the same way
if you would just...
-Okay.

51:52.309 --> 51:54.211
I-I'm not even concerned
with her.

51:54.311 --> 51:55.945
I'm concerned with us.

51:56.078 --> 51:57.947
Me too.

51:58.080 --> 51:59.916
Linda, I have to say,

52:00.049 --> 52:02.419
I've turned this over
in my mind a million times,

52:02.552 --> 52:04.454
and if the shoe were
on the other foot,

52:04.587 --> 52:05.922
I would keep your secret.

52:06.055 --> 52:08.325
I know I would do that for you.

52:14.130 --> 52:16.098
So...

52:16.233 --> 52:18.735
you've lied under oath,

52:18.835 --> 52:22.104
and you're asking me
to do the same.

52:25.408 --> 52:27.677
-Why are you saying it
like that?
-What do you mean?

52:27.810 --> 52:29.979
In legalese or whatever.

52:30.112 --> 52:31.981
Oh. Fuck.

52:32.114 --> 52:33.616
-LINDA: I don't know, Monica.
-Shh.

52:33.750 --> 52:34.984
I'm-I'm frightened.

52:35.117 --> 52:37.287
Okay.
I just... I think...

52:37.420 --> 52:39.589
(static crackling)

52:39.689 --> 52:41.924
-JACKIE: What's happening?
-The mic fell down.

52:42.024 --> 52:43.526
-Down where?!
-Probably in her blouse.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.262
-Go. Go, go.
-Go. Go.

52:45.362 --> 52:47.364
And tell her
to bring up Vernon Jordan!

52:47.497 --> 52:50.500
-What's going on?
-I'm just itchy. Go ahead.

52:50.633 --> 52:51.968
I think you're making this
into something that it's not.

52:52.101 --> 52:53.370
All you have to do, if they ask,

52:53.503 --> 52:54.937
is say, "I don't remember.

52:55.037 --> 52:56.606
I don't recall..."
Okay, what's-what's happening?

52:56.706 --> 52:59.776
I just... I'm gonna go
to the bathroom.

52:59.876 --> 53:01.711
I'll be right back.
(sighs)

53:03.813 --> 53:05.848
(panting)

53:15.358 --> 53:17.860
Ah, I got it.

53:18.027 --> 53:19.962
Get her to talk
about Vernon Jordan.

53:20.062 --> 53:21.964
Jesus Christ. Your one job
was to properly clip.

53:22.064 --> 53:23.966
-Okay, just breathe.
-Oh, shut up.

53:24.066 --> 53:26.135
I know how to breathe.
Sorry.

53:33.643 --> 53:35.678
The target is going through
the asset's purse.

53:36.846 --> 53:38.315
Hello.

53:38.415 --> 53:40.550
(whispering):
Hello. Is someone listening?

53:45.388 --> 53:46.756
(glass clinks)

53:46.889 --> 53:48.925
(coughing)

53:50.026 --> 53:52.662
(quietly): God.
Stop being paranoid, Monica.

53:52.762 --> 53:54.331
(sighs)

53:54.431 --> 53:57.334
-(glass clinking)
-(quietly): Shit. Fuck.

54:04.774 --> 54:07.109
Ah.
(sighs)

54:08.711 --> 54:10.112
You okay?

54:10.246 --> 54:12.114
Mm. Yeah.

54:12.248 --> 54:13.249
-Sorry. I...
-We're back! We're back!

54:13.416 --> 54:14.951
-We're back! We're back!
-Listen.

54:16.218 --> 54:17.854
(sighs)

54:17.954 --> 54:21.090
I know this might sound insane,

54:21.257 --> 54:24.427
but this whole situation,
I think, in a way--

54:24.561 --> 54:27.063
it might be easier for you
than it is for me.

54:27.196 --> 54:30.867
I'm a peon.
I don't have powerful friends.

54:30.967 --> 54:33.770
I have nobody.

54:33.936 --> 54:36.305
But you, I mean...
(laughs)

54:36.439 --> 54:41.411
You've got huge heavy hitters
in your back pocket.

54:41.544 --> 54:42.979
You're protected.

54:43.112 --> 54:44.781
What actual protection
do you think I have?

54:44.947 --> 54:46.749
I am not protected at all.

54:46.883 --> 54:49.419
Vernon Jordan got you a big job,
didn't he?

54:49.552 --> 54:50.553
Yes.

54:50.653 --> 54:51.954
Yes! Yes!

54:52.088 --> 54:53.456
LINDA:
You've got the president

54:53.590 --> 54:55.157
of the United States
looking out for you.

54:55.291 --> 54:56.593
MONICA:
Right, and if this gets out,

54:56.726 --> 54:57.727
he will hate me forever.

54:57.827 --> 55:00.096
(laughing):
Jesus, Monica.

55:00.229 --> 55:03.099
It just always comes back
to what's best for him.

55:03.232 --> 55:05.134
No, Linda.
It's me.

55:05.267 --> 55:07.003
This is for me.

55:07.136 --> 55:09.739
And all you have to do is say

55:09.839 --> 55:11.741
that you've never seen the
president behave inappropriately

55:11.841 --> 55:15.311
with anyone,
because that is 100% the truth.

55:19.649 --> 55:21.484
-I need to think about it.
-You keep saying that.

55:21.651 --> 55:22.819
-You have thought about it.
-I know.

55:22.985 --> 55:24.621
Linda, please.

55:24.754 --> 55:27.156
Please. This is my real life
we're talking about,

55:27.323 --> 55:29.826
and I'm scared.

55:29.959 --> 55:33.262
(sighs) All I need is for you
to say that you just won't

55:33.362 --> 55:35.498
tell them about me.
Please?

55:35.632 --> 55:37.199
Please.

55:41.438 --> 55:43.673
It's a big decision.
Let me sleep on it.

55:43.806 --> 55:46.208
I don't understand why
you can't just promise me that.

55:46.342 --> 55:48.645
You're asking a lot.

55:48.778 --> 55:51.313
I need the night, okay?

55:57.687 --> 56:00.356
(laughs softly)

56:04.627 --> 56:06.863
-He's put you through so much.
-(sighs)

56:07.029 --> 56:09.231
All I want is
for you to be free of it.

56:09.365 --> 56:11.200
-I hope you know that.
-I...

56:11.333 --> 56:14.036
-I don't know.
-I'll call you tomorrow,
I promise.

56:25.414 --> 56:27.149
(shutter clicking)
