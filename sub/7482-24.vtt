WEBVTT

00:10.258 --> 00:12.226
That was a puff dragon right there.

00:12.393 --> 00:14.433
All right, Angel, come back
with something stronger.

00:14.596 --> 00:17.497
Show them why you the reigning
champ right now. Let me see.

00:19.067 --> 00:21.027
Let's go, Luis.
Show me something nice right here.

00:21.169 --> 00:23.228
Come on.
Show me some fire, baby.

00:23.404 --> 00:25.133
Show me that fire.
Show me that fire.

00:28.977 --> 00:30.570
Right here. Hit me. Come on.

00:30.745 --> 00:32.735
Come on. You gonna let him
take you out like that?

00:33.982 --> 00:36.644
Show me something nice, brah.

00:36.818 --> 00:39.150
That almost got me right there, man.

00:40.688 --> 00:43.020
Like it, huh?
He took a big sip for this one.

00:43.191 --> 00:44.750
Show me some fire, baby.

00:44.926 --> 00:47.156
Grand finale.
Show me something right here, Luis.

00:49.497 --> 00:52.091
Oh, man on fire! Man on fire!

00:52.267 --> 00:55.703
Burning Angel. Burning Angel.

00:55.870 --> 00:58.805
And we got a new winner.
And new dragon.

00:58.973 --> 01:02.136
Luis "el Conquistador” Morales!

01:02.310 --> 01:05.230
Let me see you blow it up for me, baby.
Show me something nice right here.

01:07.215 --> 01:08.774
Oh, what the hell was that?

01:10.652 --> 01:12.120
- Yo, yo.
- Oh, man.

01:12.287 --> 01:14.051
Oh, what the...?

01:16.324 --> 01:17.917
That dude just jump off the bridge?

01:18.092 --> 01:19.218
That's nasty.

01:23.598 --> 01:25.225
What the hell?

01:56.864 --> 01:58.525
It's almost ready!

02:01.102 --> 02:02.536
It's alive!

02:02.704 --> 02:05.071
It's alive!

02:05.506 --> 02:08.066
Oh, gentlemen, gentlemen,
gentlemen.

02:08.243 --> 02:12.976
Oh. Sam Dog,
want some of this latest creation?

02:15.216 --> 02:17.412
Looks like someone drained it
out of a latrine. Pass.

02:17.585 --> 02:20.646
Heh. G-Bacon?
Something to clean out that 7 pounds

02:20.822 --> 02:23.848
of undigested red meat
that's putrefying in your intestines?

02:24.025 --> 02:28.121
Long as I still have my teeth,
I prefer to chew my food.

02:28.296 --> 02:29.627
This is a lot easier to digest.

02:29.797 --> 02:31.424
Full day's nutrients.
Come on, no takers?

02:31.599 --> 02:33.693
- Looks predigested.
- Al right.

02:33.868 --> 02:36.701
I guess I'm the only person
that treats their body like a temple.

02:37.372 --> 02:39.898
- Yeah, Shirley Temple.
- Ha-ha-ha.

02:40.074 --> 02:42.394
That's right. Laugh while you can,
gentlemen, because humor

02:42.543 --> 02:45.638
is the first casualty
of your impending vascular dementia.

02:47.382 --> 02:49.874
Morning, boys. What's going on?

02:50.051 --> 02:51.951
Your partner has the body
of Shirley Temple.

02:53.087 --> 02:54.646
Tell me something I don't know.

02:54.822 --> 02:55.846
Oh. You know what?

02:56.024 --> 02:58.322
That just cost you a burst
of instant awesome.

02:58.493 --> 03:02.361
- Looks more like a burst of instant...
- No, don't say it. Please.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.055
- Don't say what?
- Don't say what?

03:04.232 --> 03:06.792
Just drink your awesome.

03:06.968 --> 03:10.836
Enjoy. Sam has a little problem
with the, uh, D word.

03:11.005 --> 03:13.303
- Oh, yeah? What D word?
- Dentist?

03:13.474 --> 03:14.908
Didgeridoo? Dunkleosteus?

03:15.476 --> 03:18.002
- What is that?
- That's a prehistoric fish.

03:18.179 --> 03:19.476
Don't ask me why I know that.

03:19.647 --> 03:22.742
- Diarrhea.
- Now, what...? What did I just say?

03:22.917 --> 03:25.409
I almost died of dysentery in Angola.

03:25.586 --> 03:26.747
- Twice.
- Oh.

03:26.921 --> 03:28.252
- Twice.
- Oof.

03:28.656 --> 03:30.647
I'd rather be shot than drink that.

03:30.825 --> 03:34.284
Just to clarify, a clown with colitis
is like your worst nightmare?

03:34.462 --> 03:35.861
- Shut up, Deeks.
- Heh.

03:36.030 --> 03:37.623
Okay, too far.

03:37.799 --> 03:40.325
Sometimes I hate being the only girl.
In fact, most days, I...

03:40.501 --> 03:42.469
Eric, my friend.

03:42.637 --> 03:45.607
Please tell me we have a case,
even if we don't.

03:45.773 --> 03:47.832
- Oh, uh, yeah.
- Thank God.

03:48.009 --> 03:49.875
It's like a high school locker room
down there.

03:50.044 --> 03:52.604
You know what? Never mind.
You wouldn't understand. You're a boy.

03:52.747 --> 03:55.375
No, actually, I do understand.
I was a geek in high school.

03:55.550 --> 03:56.984
The locker room
was my Thunderdome.

03:57.151 --> 03:59.483
Yeah? Maybe it's because
of the Florence Henderson haircut.

03:59.654 --> 04:01.281
Nell!

04:06.027 --> 04:09.657
What's the skinny, mini,
a.k.a. Ms. Jones?

04:09.831 --> 04:11.765
L.A.P.D. received a hotline tip

04:11.933 --> 04:13.992
from someone who witnessed
an apparent suicide

04:14.168 --> 04:16.363
off the Whittier Street Bridge
last night.

04:16.536 --> 04:20.166
The body has been identified
as Lieutenant Commander Steven Hill,

04:20.341 --> 04:22.708
an engineer officer
on the USS Darlington,

04:22.877 --> 04:24.868
an Ohio-class nuclear sub.

04:25.046 --> 04:27.515
Now, the Darlington has been
at sea for three weeks,

04:27.682 --> 04:29.844
but Hill has been listed
as an unauthorized absence

04:30.017 --> 04:31.075
for almost a month.

04:31.252 --> 04:33.516
- Family?
- Wife and son.

04:33.688 --> 04:36.589
His spouse reported him missing
28 days ago.

04:36.758 --> 04:39.591
- Any red flags? Gambling? Drugs?
- No.

04:39.761 --> 04:41.422
Nothing on his file.

04:41.596 --> 04:44.258
And we can't question his unit,
because they're already underway.

04:44.432 --> 04:46.872
Because of his top-secret rating
and knowledge of our boomers,

04:47.034 --> 04:48.661
we've been tasked
with checking it out.

04:48.836 --> 04:50.031
Okay.

04:50.204 --> 04:52.798
- Crime scene, family?
- Uh, Sam was a sailor.

04:52.974 --> 04:54.254
You should probably take family.

04:55.042 --> 04:56.942
- Crime scene.
- Gah.

04:57.111 --> 04:59.102
- Heh, heh.
- Diarrhea.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.114
- Stop it.
- Ow.

05:01.282 --> 05:04.217
I actually felt that.
How does he do that? Ow!

05:04.385 --> 05:07.013
- Felt that?
- Yeah, because you actually hit me.

05:07.188 --> 05:08.828
Sorry, did I get you
in your dunklesaurus?

05:08.956 --> 05:13.291
Um, okay, just for the record,
it's Dunkleosteus.

05:23.137 --> 05:25.697
- That'll do it.
- Yeah, but why here?

05:26.374 --> 05:28.206
And where's his car?
It wasn't up there.

05:29.243 --> 05:30.972
Could have been stolen
in this part of town.

05:31.879 --> 05:32.971
Or he could have walked.

05:33.147 --> 05:34.808
- From where?
- Yeah.

05:35.416 --> 05:37.214
There's not much around here.

05:37.618 --> 05:40.952
- Bus?
- Who takes a bus to a suicide?

05:41.122 --> 05:44.490
Ah, you'd be surprised.
Golden Gate Bridge, Niagara Falls.

05:44.659 --> 05:46.889
Both iconic. This is just sad.

05:47.061 --> 05:50.463
Well, maybe our guy
lacked imagination.

05:50.631 --> 05:52.565
Or he was so distraught
he didn't care.

05:52.733 --> 05:54.428
"Eng" on a boomer is tough.

05:54.602 --> 05:57.003
Just spending months at a time
on a sub takes a special type.

05:57.171 --> 05:59.071
All of whom
are extensively screened.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.676
L.A.P.D. got an anonymous tip.
Why don't we have Eric check the area

06:02.844 --> 06:04.884
for cell-phone activity
around the time of the jump?

06:08.216 --> 06:10.241
Speak of the chicken-legged devil.

06:10.918 --> 06:12.682
What do you got, Eric?

06:12.854 --> 06:14.913
Prelim autopsy report
from the coroner's office.

06:15.089 --> 06:17.490
They're saying Hill was dead
before he hit the pavement.

06:17.658 --> 06:19.148
Hard to jump when you're a corpse.

06:19.327 --> 06:20.624
Hmm. Unless you're a zombie.

06:21.295 --> 06:22.660
You got a cause of death?

06:23.197 --> 06:24.790
Cocaine overdose.

06:32.773 --> 06:34.263
What do you got?

06:35.142 --> 06:38.874
Coroner's report says
that Hill died of a cocaine overdose.

06:40.648 --> 06:43.845
- Well, that doesn't fit the profile.
- No, it doesn't.

06:45.019 --> 06:46.714
Are you sure
I can't get you something?

06:46.888 --> 06:48.049
No. Thank you very much.

06:48.222 --> 06:51.749
I have people bringing food over
all morning. I...

06:51.926 --> 06:54.054
I have no idea what I'm supposed
to do with all of it.

06:55.096 --> 06:56.962
I know this is incredibly difficult,
Mrs. Hill,

06:57.131 --> 06:59.862
but we need to gather as much
information as fast as possible.

07:01.769 --> 07:05.069
Yeah. I kept telling myself
Steven was coming back,

07:05.540 --> 07:08.032
but I didn't expect it to be like this.

07:08.209 --> 07:10.490
You reported him missing
a few weeks ago? Is that correct?

07:10.645 --> 07:12.613
Twenty-eight days.

07:13.414 --> 07:16.611
Yeah, he was right here,
working on the playhouse.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.548
He needed something
from the hardware store.

07:19.453 --> 07:22.184
I was gonna go with him,
but Adam had just fallen asleep.

07:22.356 --> 07:23.517
Adam's your son?

07:24.158 --> 07:25.387
He's 7.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.889
I haven't told him yet.

07:30.565 --> 07:34.399
He's used to his father being away
for extended periods of time,

07:34.569 --> 07:37.163
but you know,
this time he's not coming back.

07:37.605 --> 07:40.131
Did your husband struggle
with anything?

07:40.308 --> 07:42.003
Alcohol? Gambling? Drugs?

07:42.777 --> 07:44.905
No, he was squared away,
as you say.

07:45.079 --> 07:48.515
Steven wouldn't have put Adam
and me through this willingly.

07:48.950 --> 07:51.214
Mrs. Hill, what do you think
happened to your husband?

07:53.955 --> 07:55.889
I don't know,

07:56.924 --> 07:59.416
and neither do his friends.

08:00.161 --> 08:03.256
The coroner report says your husband
died of a cocaine overdose.

08:03.731 --> 08:05.961
No way. That's impossible.

08:06.133 --> 08:09.569
Steven didn't use drugs ever.
He didn't smoke. He barely drank beer.

08:10.271 --> 08:12.706
Now, I don't know what happened
to my husband,

08:12.873 --> 08:15.706
but I know he did not die
from a drug overdose.

08:17.612 --> 08:20.638
You need to leave. Now.

08:20.815 --> 08:22.510
- Thank you.
- Of course.

08:24.986 --> 08:26.215
Okay.

09:32.286 --> 09:33.515
Owen?

09:40.728 --> 09:44.858
You've been wearing the same shoes
for six months.

09:49.103 --> 09:50.366
What's wrong?

09:51.138 --> 09:52.537
What have you heard?

09:52.707 --> 09:54.471
Nothing.

09:54.642 --> 10:00.638
But I can surmise that the White Ghost
has come back to haunt me.

10:01.549 --> 10:03.984
Look, you knew this day
was coming.

10:04.985 --> 10:06.885
What's the official word?

10:08.422 --> 10:11.687
Administrative leave
pending a full investigation.

10:12.860 --> 10:15.488
- Effective...?
- Immediately.

10:16.497 --> 10:17.828
Of course.

10:17.998 --> 10:20.092
Of course.

10:21.602 --> 10:25.095
- I'm sorry.
- Spare me your platitudes, Owen.

10:25.272 --> 10:26.899
You may need them yourself.

10:27.074 --> 10:29.406
Somebody in Washington
is stirring this up.

10:29.577 --> 10:31.375
- It's a witch hunt.
- Yes.

10:32.179 --> 10:37.413
And unfortunately,
I'm the one left holding the broom.

10:48.828 --> 10:51.525
Lieutenant Commander Hill's
wife says he never used any drugs.

10:51.697 --> 10:54.598
But toxicology proves he died
of a cocaine overdose.

10:54.767 --> 10:57.259
Preliminary autopsy report shows
signs of repeated needle use.

10:57.436 --> 10:59.302
IV cocaine injection is hard-core.

10:59.472 --> 11:01.272
How long was he dead
before he was thrown off?

11:01.407 --> 11:03.273
- An hour, maybe less.
- If your buddy ODs,

11:03.442 --> 11:05.809
you take him to the ER,
you don't toss him off a bridge.

11:05.978 --> 11:07.104
Yeah, this was deliberate.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.942
It's either an act of anger
or it was meant to look like a suicide.

11:10.116 --> 11:13.518
- Or both.
- The question remains, to what end?

11:13.953 --> 11:17.821
- Wonder Twins find anything?
- As a matter of fact, we did.

11:17.990 --> 11:20.049
Cell activity in the vicinity
of the bridge

11:20.226 --> 11:22.957
around the time
Hill's body was dumped.

11:23.129 --> 11:26.190
Most of it's probably automobile traffic,
but I've got some

11:26.365 --> 11:29.300
that remain in the area long enough
to have possibly witnessed something.

11:29.468 --> 11:33.302
- Do you have any names?
- Yeah. But only one with a record.

11:35.608 --> 11:39.238
"James Martinez."
Affiliated with the Mission Street Gang.

11:39.412 --> 11:41.932
- That's their territory.
- If anybody was hanging around there,

11:42.048 --> 11:44.312
it was someone from their gang.
Do you have an address?

11:44.483 --> 11:46.542
Yeah, I got six.
He's bounced around a lot.

11:46.919 --> 11:48.387
It's quicker to just ask his gang.

11:48.988 --> 11:51.116
It's quicker, but it's a hell
of a lot more dangerous.

11:51.290 --> 11:53.691
- Thanks, Eric.
- Where's your sense of adventure?

11:53.859 --> 11:56.920
Ileftitin
my sense-of-self-preservation pants.

11:57.096 --> 11:59.087
- They still fit you?
- Sure do.

11:59.265 --> 12:02.030
So I went back through
Steven Hill's records,

12:02.201 --> 12:04.363
all of which confirm
what his wife said.

12:04.537 --> 12:06.198
On Wednesday, April 16th,

12:06.372 --> 12:10.434
he bought a circular saw blade
from a hardware store at 3:48 p.m.,

12:10.610 --> 12:12.100
six blocks away from his house.

12:12.278 --> 12:13.712
- And after that?
- Nothing.

12:13.879 --> 12:16.644
His cell phone gets turned off,
his car disappears,

12:16.816 --> 12:18.511
and his credit cards
are never used again.

12:18.684 --> 12:20.675
- Traffic cams?
- Nope.

12:20.853 --> 12:22.252
So maybe he was abducted.

12:22.421 --> 12:24.549
I mean, he's an engineer
aboard a nuclear submarine.

12:24.724 --> 12:26.089
He's got top-secret clearance.

12:26.259 --> 12:29.627
He's got access to tons of proprietary
and technological information.

12:29.795 --> 12:33.288
So, what, grab him, shoot him full
of drugs, pick his brain, and then...?

12:33.466 --> 12:35.230
- And then what?
- Kill him with an overdose,

12:35.401 --> 12:37.631
throw him over a bridge,
make it look like a suicide.

12:37.803 --> 12:39.202
- That's not bad.
- It's not nice,

12:39.372 --> 12:40.533
but it's pretty damn clever.

12:40.706 --> 12:43.732
Okay, so who grabbed him?
North Korea?

12:43.909 --> 12:46.537
- Pakistan?
- What did you expect?

12:46.712 --> 12:49.807
- This was gonna go away quietly?
- No.

12:53.219 --> 12:55.950
Neither am I. Tell them that.

12:56.289 --> 12:58.883
Wait a minute.
I... I have nothing to do with this.

12:59.058 --> 13:00.822
Well, maybe that's the problem.

13:00.993 --> 13:04.190
Because if you are not watching
my back,

13:04.363 --> 13:06.661
then you might as well be stabbing it.

13:07.300 --> 13:09.268
I hate it when Mom and Dad fight.

13:09.735 --> 13:13.228
Ms. Jones.
I need a flight to Washington.

13:13.406 --> 13:14.840
I'm on it.

13:15.408 --> 13:16.705
Hetty.

13:18.711 --> 13:20.179
Is everything okay?

13:21.847 --> 13:25.477
No, everything is not okay,
Agent Blye.

13:25.951 --> 13:28.682
But would you please return
to work?

13:43.069 --> 13:44.696
You ever in a gang?

13:44.870 --> 13:45.996
Tsk.

13:46.172 --> 13:49.142
All the years we've worked together,
have I mentioned me being in a gang?

13:49.308 --> 13:51.572
I don't know. Maybe you were
too embarrassed to admit it.

13:51.744 --> 13:53.838
Do I look like someone
who would be in a gang?

13:55.815 --> 13:58.477
- Well, you know.
- Well, what about you?

13:58.651 --> 14:02.087
Mr. Crew-Cut, bullet scars,
only goes by "G."

14:02.254 --> 14:05.246
You're, like, one swastika tattoo
and a pair of Doc Martens away

14:05.424 --> 14:07.791
from looking like all the white
supremacists we ever busted.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.519
- I got better teeth.
- Ha, ha.

14:09.695 --> 14:10.924
- You know it.
- Guilty.

14:12.498 --> 14:13.659
Here we go.

14:13.833 --> 14:15.528
A little garden party going on here.

14:15.701 --> 14:17.066
Yeah.

14:21.607 --> 14:24.235
Black tank top is Salazar,
their leader.

14:26.779 --> 14:28.076
You guys lost?

14:28.247 --> 14:30.011
Eh, we're just looking for a friend.

14:30.716 --> 14:33.014
I don't think
you have any friends here.

14:33.753 --> 14:35.187
Yeah, you're probably right.

14:36.489 --> 14:39.220
Just want to ask one of your boys
about something he might have seen.

14:39.392 --> 14:41.053
Nice car.

14:41.227 --> 14:43.559
Yeah, it is. Don't touch it.

14:43.729 --> 14:45.163
I'm serious.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.568
There's only one way
this goes well for you, Salazar.

14:50.736 --> 14:52.226
How's that?

14:52.405 --> 14:54.772
You tell us where James Martinez is,
and we're gone.

14:55.741 --> 14:57.573
What makes you think I know him?

14:57.743 --> 14:59.734
You wouldn't be much of a leader
if you didn't.

15:01.013 --> 15:04.039
I don't know you,
and I know a lot of cops.

15:04.216 --> 15:06.878
We're federal agents.
You wouldn't wanna know us.

15:08.521 --> 15:10.853
A body was dumped
off the Whittier Street Bridge.

15:11.023 --> 15:12.388
Martinez might have
seen something.

15:16.862 --> 15:18.626
Well, I can call LAP.D.,

15:18.798 --> 15:21.062
have them send over
their urban assault team

15:21.233 --> 15:23.463
and just go house to house
and look for him.

15:27.773 --> 15:29.434
Where's Martinez working today?

15:30.176 --> 15:31.735
Fruit stand on Mateo.

15:33.145 --> 15:34.374
Wasn't that easy?

15:36.148 --> 15:37.582
One love, baby.

15:53.432 --> 15:55.958
- You know he's gonna run.
- No, he might not.

15:56.135 --> 15:58.126
Trust me, he's gonna run.
You know how I can tell?

15:58.304 --> 16:00.602
Because it's 85 degrees out
and we're both wearing jeans?

16:00.773 --> 16:02.332
- Exactly.
- Mm-hm.

16:02.508 --> 16:04.408
- You could just hit him with your car.
- Nah.

16:04.577 --> 16:06.136
I just got it detailed.

16:08.848 --> 16:10.077
Yo, yo!

16:17.923 --> 16:19.152
Yo, what you looking for?

16:19.325 --> 16:21.919
Looking for you, James.

16:22.728 --> 16:24.492
You run, we chase you.

16:24.663 --> 16:26.927
- We chase you, we catch you.
- And when we catch you,

16:27.099 --> 16:29.033
we're gonna tell Salazar
you're our informant.

16:29.602 --> 16:32.628
What'd you see the other night
under the Whittier Street Bridge?

16:33.172 --> 16:36.005
I don't know what you're talking about.
I gotta get to school.

16:36.175 --> 16:38.610
He's funny.

16:40.312 --> 16:43.509
- And there he goes.
- He must be late for class.

16:44.116 --> 16:46.483
- What, really?
- Yeah, I'll follow him in the car.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.310
Let's go.

17:19.117 --> 17:22.053
- You almost had him.
- I'm driving the rest of this week.

17:22.221 --> 17:23.882
Not if you don't catch him, you don't.

17:24.056 --> 17:25.546
Yeah.

17:27.425 --> 17:30.418
- I'll keep the a.c. on.
- Funny.

17:57.056 --> 17:58.285
Down on the ground.

18:02.828 --> 18:04.523
That's for making me run.

18:16.874 --> 18:18.638
Hetty, do you have a minute?

18:18.810 --> 18:21.336
- Is it urgent?
- I don't know. I'm not sure.

18:21.512 --> 18:23.241
Well, then it's not.

18:23.414 --> 18:26.008
And if it's not, I don't have a minute.

18:27.151 --> 18:29.085
Uh, does this...?
Does this have anything to do

18:29.253 --> 18:31.278
with what happened in Afghanistan?

18:31.989 --> 18:37.325
Agent Blye, I have work to do,
and I'm sure you must too.

18:48.539 --> 18:49.836
She shut me down again.

18:50.842 --> 18:53.436
Wish she'd teach me how to do that.

18:54.679 --> 18:56.999
I'm telling you, this has something
to do with Afghanistan.

18:57.148 --> 18:58.946
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

18:59.484 --> 19:01.282
If it wasn't, she would have said so.

19:11.829 --> 19:14.264
Survey says heroin.

19:14.432 --> 19:16.560
What are you taking at school,
pharmacology?

19:17.535 --> 19:19.367
- That's not mine.
- Yeah?

19:19.904 --> 19:21.303
Not anymore, it isn't.

19:25.409 --> 19:26.774
- Hey.
- Hey, what?

19:27.378 --> 19:28.641
You said this wasn't yours.

19:29.781 --> 19:33.581
- It's still somebody's personal property.
- Was. Now it's evidence.

19:34.952 --> 19:38.411
I don't have to talk to you guys.
I got the right to remain silent.

19:38.856 --> 19:40.722
Yeah, you also have the right
to remain stupid.

19:42.093 --> 19:45.085
Or you can be smart. Tell us what you
saw under the Whittier Street Bridge.

19:46.297 --> 19:47.765
I don't even know where that is.

19:47.932 --> 19:49.195
No?

19:50.668 --> 19:52.659
Man on fire! Man on fire!

19:52.837 --> 19:56.000
- Burning Angel. Burning Angel.
- Huh.

19:57.141 --> 19:59.439
These must be buddies of yours
from your Mensa group.

20:00.111 --> 20:03.081
Luis "el Conquistador” Morales.

20:03.581 --> 20:07.279
Show me something, baby.
Let me see. Oh! Ha-ha-ha!

20:07.451 --> 20:08.475
What the hell was that?

20:09.854 --> 20:11.686
No eyes on the bridge,
but you can hear a car.

20:11.856 --> 20:14.689
Every engine has
its own acoustic signature.

20:14.859 --> 20:17.099
That would be great
if we had an engine to compare it to,

20:17.261 --> 20:18.524
- but we don't.
- True.

20:18.696 --> 20:21.393
But I narrowed down the size
and type of engine,

20:21.566 --> 20:23.091
and by searching traffic cams,

20:23.267 --> 20:26.202
I found three matches
in the vicinity at that time.

20:26.704 --> 20:30.538
One of which is registered
to Michael Wilson.

20:30.708 --> 20:32.369
Served time
and he's a white supremacist.

20:32.543 --> 20:34.841
Card-carrying member
of the Herrenvolk Brotherhood.

20:35.012 --> 20:36.275
Currently on parole.

20:36.714 --> 20:39.843
You may get a chance to sport that
Nazi tattoo before the day's over yet.

20:40.017 --> 20:43.214
Wonderful. Send us his address.
Have his P.O. meet us over there.

20:43.387 --> 20:45.879
Otherwise, I, uh... I want their blessing
to check in on him.

20:46.057 --> 20:47.525
Got it.

20:49.961 --> 20:51.827
Hey, have either of you spoken
to Hetty today?

20:51.996 --> 20:54.988
- No. Why?
- Because I think something's up.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.656
It's Hetty. Something's always up.

20:56.834 --> 20:58.359
She's being called back
to Washington,

20:58.536 --> 21:01.198
and Kensi thinks it's about Afghanistan
and the White Ghost thing.

21:01.372 --> 21:03.372
Can you guys talk to her
whenever you get a chance?

21:03.541 --> 21:05.566
We will.
It's gonna have to wait, though.

21:12.216 --> 21:15.049
You wanted to speak
with me, Hetty?

21:15.219 --> 21:16.687
Look at this.

21:18.122 --> 21:20.648
Lipstick gun. Ha, ha.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.992
They were all the rage in the '50s.

21:25.162 --> 21:26.561
Cool.

21:26.731 --> 21:28.358
- Must have that.
- Mm.

21:30.334 --> 21:33.269
- So is everything okay?
- I doubt it.

21:33.437 --> 21:37.169
Fallout from
the White Ghost incident.

21:37.541 --> 21:39.339
Should I be worried?

21:39.510 --> 21:41.035
Has that ever helped?

21:41.913 --> 21:44.883
Careful, yes. Vigilant, definitely.

21:46.918 --> 21:49.853
- Leave the worry to your enemy.
- Hmm.

21:51.422 --> 21:53.789
I will check in with you every day.

21:53.958 --> 21:57.189
However, should I fail to do so,

21:57.628 --> 22:00.256
follow the enclosed directions

22:00.431 --> 22:02.422
as soon as possible.

22:03.167 --> 22:05.499
- Understood?
- What?

22:05.670 --> 22:07.638
- No.
- Yes.

22:07.805 --> 22:11.207
I mean, yes, of course, but...

22:11.776 --> 22:14.973
- What's going on?
- Wish I knew.

22:15.146 --> 22:19.413
It could just be the new administration
flexing their muscles.

22:20.051 --> 22:21.576
Right, and if it's not?

22:21.953 --> 22:24.149
You have your instructions.

22:25.523 --> 22:27.491
- Okay.
- All right.

22:27.658 --> 22:29.592
Big hug.

22:49.847 --> 22:51.076
Set.

22:54.785 --> 22:56.014
No answer.

22:56.187 --> 22:57.518
Try again.

23:03.894 --> 23:05.487
It's locked. I'm gonna pick it.

23:20.745 --> 23:23.646
- Unh. You okay?
- Yeah.

23:23.814 --> 23:25.043
I think so.

23:26.984 --> 23:29.476
- Some serious firepower.
- You think?

23:29.787 --> 23:31.347
Federal agents!
Throw down your weapons!

23:31.956 --> 23:33.185
Grenade!

23:40.798 --> 23:42.960
- Son of a bitch.
- Kensi, Deeks,

23:43.134 --> 23:45.054
fall back, get ready for them
to come out firing.

23:45.202 --> 23:46.863
- Eric, we need backup.
- On its way.

23:47.038 --> 23:48.164
A hand grenade?

23:48.339 --> 23:50.831
You told them to throw down
their weapons.

23:51.275 --> 23:53.369
Guys, nobody's coming.

23:55.980 --> 23:58.142
We got nothing, nobody coming.

24:10.693 --> 24:13.162
- That Wilson?
- It's hard to say.

24:13.329 --> 24:14.660
The guy's in pretty bad shape.

24:14.831 --> 24:16.822
- Is he gonna make it?
- Eh, it's doubtful.

24:16.999 --> 24:19.991
Found more bodies inside, including
a woman that was shackled to a bed.

24:20.169 --> 24:21.849
May have been executed
before we got there.

24:22.004 --> 24:23.904
There was a single gunshot wound
to her face.

24:24.073 --> 24:25.905
- This?
- Looks like her ID.

24:26.075 --> 24:28.169
Found it in what might have been
her purse.

24:28.344 --> 24:31.279
Sent a photo to Eric. Hopefully,
he'll get a match at the DMV.

24:31.447 --> 24:32.972
What's shaking, partner?

24:35.585 --> 24:37.610
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

24:37.787 --> 24:39.050
Hi, hi.

24:39.222 --> 24:41.088
All right, there... Hi.

24:41.257 --> 24:43.851
- Did you guys make this mess?
- Yeah, we did.

24:44.026 --> 24:46.654
DEA Agent Talia Del Campo,
you remember Agents Callen, Hanna.

24:46.829 --> 24:47.921
- How you doing?
- Good.

24:48.097 --> 24:49.565
- Good to see you again.
- You too.

24:49.732 --> 24:52.702
- And this is Special Agent Kensi Blye.
- Hey.

24:52.869 --> 24:56.430
Ah. You actually do exist.
I thought you were an imaginary friend.

24:56.606 --> 24:58.370
Imaginary friend?

24:58.908 --> 25:01.536
You were on another assignment
the last time we hooked up.

25:01.711 --> 25:03.201
Partnered, partnered up. She...

25:03.379 --> 25:04.847
We were teamed up. Partnered up.

25:05.014 --> 25:07.334
They teamed us up because
of an explosion at a fish market.

25:07.483 --> 25:08.541
Right. Yeah.

25:09.151 --> 25:10.585
What's your connection to Wilson?

25:10.753 --> 25:12.881
The DEA's been following
the Herrenvolk Brotherhood.

25:13.055 --> 25:14.853
They move half the meth
on the West Coast.

25:15.024 --> 25:16.321
What about coke?

25:16.792 --> 25:20.353
Not traditionally, but they've been
forming some new alliances. Why?

25:20.830 --> 25:22.590
Something else we're working on.
Nothing big.

25:22.732 --> 25:26.066
Heh. Right. You guys hate to share.

25:28.037 --> 25:31.200
- Something wrong?
- Oh, no. Sorry. Uh...

25:31.374 --> 25:32.705
You're just not what I pictured.

25:34.010 --> 25:35.569
Oh, yeah? What did you picture?

25:35.978 --> 25:38.675
I don't know.
Uh, I guess the name threw me.

25:38.848 --> 25:42.648
When I heard "Kensi," I guess I just
expected Barbie's Malibu cousin.

25:45.154 --> 25:46.986
Thought I'd be seeing
a blond California girl.

25:48.457 --> 25:51.154
- Not even close.
- I can see that now.

25:52.995 --> 25:56.397
Okay, then. We're gonna
run down this lead. We'll, uh...

25:56.566 --> 26:00.560
- We'll let you know what we find.
- Yeah. You three should talk.

26:00.736 --> 26:03.762
See if you could find something
to help on this.

26:04.507 --> 26:07.067
- You don't want me to come with you?
- We're good.

26:07.677 --> 26:09.877
You think it's safe to leave Deeks
alone with those two?

26:10.012 --> 26:13.607
Oh... Hell of a lot safer than being here
when the claws come out.

26:13.783 --> 26:16.514
All right, why don't you follow us
to the boatshed?

26:16.686 --> 26:18.176
Good. I'll grab my car.

26:18.354 --> 26:20.789
- Sure. See you there.
- See you.

26:22.758 --> 26:25.193
- She's pretty.
- Who? Talia?

26:25.361 --> 26:27.261
- No, Queen Elizabeth.
- Heh. Regal, maybe.

26:27.430 --> 26:30.110
I always thought her sister, Princess
Margaret, was the hot one. Ow!

26:30.266 --> 26:33.395
- Don't be an idiot.
- You brought up the Windsor sisters.

26:33.569 --> 26:35.697
- You don't think she's attractive?
- You know what?

26:35.871 --> 26:37.532
I honestly never even noticed.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.802
Ah! God. All right.

26:40.977 --> 26:43.810
Okay, I've not noticed that she's not

26:43.980 --> 26:45.641
- not attractive.
- She's beautiful.

26:45.815 --> 26:47.214
You're beautiful.

26:50.319 --> 26:53.254
I don't know why you punched me then.
What is that for?

26:53.422 --> 26:55.186
- For good luck.
- That's not...

26:55.358 --> 26:58.020
- That's not good luck.
- Just get in the car and drive.

26:58.194 --> 27:01.186
Rabbit feet, four-leaf clovers,
those are good luck.

27:01.364 --> 27:04.459
Your abusive nature,
there's nothing good-lucky about that.

27:06.469 --> 27:08.267
- Anything yet?
- Yeah. Got a hit.

27:08.437 --> 27:10.371
- Jennifer Anderson.
- Is she a missing person?

27:10.539 --> 27:12.303
- No.
- Single?

27:12.475 --> 27:17.436
Uh, married.
Husband Charles Anderson, no kids.

27:17.613 --> 27:20.742
Guy owns a yacht-building company
in Marina del Rey.

27:20.916 --> 27:23.112
- Successful?
- Barely.

27:23.285 --> 27:24.946
That rules out a kidnap for ransom.

27:25.121 --> 27:27.180
Unless the kidnappers didn't know
he was struggling.

27:27.356 --> 27:30.656
Or he hired them himself.
She have a life-insurance policy?

27:30.826 --> 27:33.124
If she did,
it might take me a while to find it.

27:33.295 --> 27:34.660
All right.
Let us know when you do.

27:34.830 --> 27:36.298
Yeah.

27:37.033 --> 27:40.128
Last time I was here,
you had to carry me to the bathroom.

27:40.302 --> 27:41.326
Remember that?

27:42.338 --> 27:45.603
She had a stonefish spine stuck
in her leg.

27:45.775 --> 27:47.004
Right.

27:47.176 --> 27:50.908
- Excuse me, I'm gonna go to the b...
- Ahem. I'm gonna go to the b... Please.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.310
- After you.
- Oh, no. You go ahead. Please.

27:53.482 --> 27:55.280
- I can wait.
- No, no, guests first.

27:55.451 --> 27:57.112
- I insist.
- Why don't I just...?

27:57.286 --> 27:59.550
- I'll run to the bathroom. Just go to...
- No. You...

27:59.722 --> 28:02.555
- Nope.
- Back away. Heh.

28:02.725 --> 28:04.625
You know what?
I suggest you go after me.

28:04.794 --> 28:07.126
You see, he refuses to put
the toilet seat back down.

28:08.297 --> 28:12.564
And I can't tell you how many times
I've had a wet butt thanks to him.

28:12.735 --> 28:14.935
I don't think that means
what you think that that means.

28:18.074 --> 28:20.475
What? Sitting on a toilet
without looking down?

28:20.643 --> 28:22.236
I mean, that's just plain reckless.

28:22.712 --> 28:24.146
- All right.
- Ah!

28:24.313 --> 28:26.714
That is for not telling me
how beautiful she is.

28:26.882 --> 28:29.749
You should've seen the last one.

28:29.919 --> 28:32.889
Uh-huh. It all makes sense now.
I get it.

28:33.055 --> 28:34.648
What makes sense now?

28:34.824 --> 28:36.883
Your partner is smoking hot,

28:37.059 --> 28:39.824
and you are very clearly
madly in love with her.

28:39.995 --> 28:41.360
- So...
- No, no. No, no.

28:41.530 --> 28:43.624
I mean, we're very close, honestly,

28:43.799 --> 28:46.063
but it's much more
of a brother-and-sister relationship.

28:46.235 --> 28:49.865
Really? So you're telling me
that the two of you never tsk-tsk.

28:50.039 --> 28:53.441
- That would be against regulations.
- That's not a no.

28:56.212 --> 29:00.240
You know, I wouldn't have let
regulations stop me if we were partners.

29:01.283 --> 29:03.752
I'm sorry, just to clarify,
if you and I were partners,

29:03.919 --> 29:06.889
or if you and Kensi were partners?

29:07.823 --> 29:09.052
Either, or.

29:09.225 --> 29:12.195
Wow. Gonna go ahead
and save that image in my head.

29:13.095 --> 29:15.792
Why don't you tell me why you burned
down Michael Wilson's house?

29:15.965 --> 29:17.660
Because that's just how we roll.

29:17.833 --> 29:20.029
What can you tell us
about the Herrenvolk Brotherhood

29:20.202 --> 29:22.569
- and these new alliances?
- Well,

29:22.738 --> 29:25.139
there are 450 active gangs
in Los Angeles,

29:25.307 --> 29:28.242
which translates to about
45,000 gang members.

29:28.410 --> 29:31.505
The irony of the prison system is,
once you guys bust them,

29:31.680 --> 29:34.115
all of them end up in the same...

29:34.917 --> 29:36.214
place.

29:36.385 --> 29:38.065
They're forced
to interact with each other.

29:38.220 --> 29:41.155
The smarter ones realize that
they have a lot more to financially gain

29:41.323 --> 29:43.951
by working together than shooting
each other over a street corner.

29:44.126 --> 29:45.560
- Exactly.
- Hmm.

29:48.497 --> 29:52.297
So, what about the...?
The Herrenvolk, uh, the Brotherhood?

29:52.468 --> 29:55.028
Uh, they're aligning themselves
with someone because the...

29:55.204 --> 29:57.400
- They gotta do that.
- I'll help you out. We thought

29:57.573 --> 29:59.667
they may have been working
with the Brenasolo cartel,

29:59.842 --> 30:04.746
but as of this afternoon, any proof
we may have had went up in smoke.

30:05.247 --> 30:06.806
Mm-hm. That makes it...

30:06.982 --> 30:08.347
- Poof.
- Mm-hm.

30:08.517 --> 30:09.643
Difficult.

30:21.497 --> 30:23.829
Gentlemen, can I help you?

30:24.300 --> 30:25.995
- Charles Anderson?
- Mm-hm.

30:26.168 --> 30:30.071
Special Agent Hanna.
Special Agent Callen. NCIS.

30:30.239 --> 30:33.038
We just wanna ask you
a few questions about your wife.

30:33.209 --> 30:34.335
What about her?

30:34.743 --> 30:37.110
Well, when was the last time
you spoke to her?

30:37.613 --> 30:38.842
Yesterday.

30:39.014 --> 30:41.005
- Not today?
- Not yet.

30:41.183 --> 30:43.049
Well, she's in Europe with a friend.

30:44.787 --> 30:46.587
Do you have a number
where we could reach her?

30:46.722 --> 30:49.521
Heh. Not until she reaches her hotel.

30:49.692 --> 30:51.820
She's on a train to Istanbul.

30:51.994 --> 30:53.325
What is this about?

30:53.896 --> 30:55.227
Her driver's license was found

30:55.397 --> 30:58.196
at the scene of a shootout
and ensuing fire this morning.

30:59.368 --> 31:01.894
A woman's body was recovered.

31:03.472 --> 31:05.167
Had her purse been stolen recently?

31:11.380 --> 31:13.212
Mr. Anderson?

31:14.083 --> 31:17.917
Are you sure...?
You sure it was Jen?

31:18.954 --> 31:20.888
We're waiting for a positive ID.

31:24.293 --> 31:26.557
They swore they wouldn't hurt her.

31:26.729 --> 31:28.026
Who did?

31:28.564 --> 31:31.158
They wanted me to design
and build them a boat.

31:31.333 --> 31:32.767
- Who?
- I don't know.

31:33.602 --> 31:35.161
They never used any names.

31:36.238 --> 31:37.899
Drug dealers.

31:39.508 --> 31:44.571
They were supposed
to release her today after their run.

31:45.014 --> 31:46.614
What kind of boat
did you build for them?

31:49.118 --> 31:50.745
A submersible.

31:52.021 --> 31:53.284
A submarine?

32:11.339 --> 32:14.673
The cartels have been
using narco subs since the '90s.

32:14.842 --> 32:18.176
Originally, they were primitive
low-profile semisubmersibles

32:18.346 --> 32:21.008
with just the exhaust
and a cockpit out of the water.

32:21.182 --> 32:24.618
But lately, they've been making them
bigger and more sophisticated.

32:24.785 --> 32:28.949
Anderson sent the one he built
in pieces to be assembled in Colombia.

32:29.123 --> 32:32.787
According to the specs,
it's capable of traveling 2,500 miles

32:32.960 --> 32:34.928
and diving to a depth of 60 feet.

32:35.096 --> 32:36.962
Makes it almost impossible to spot.

32:37.131 --> 32:40.294
We estimate that at least a third
of Colombia's cocaine export

32:40.468 --> 32:43.199
- is coming in via sub.
- But less than 15 percent of them

32:43.371 --> 32:44.634
are actually caught.

32:44.805 --> 32:46.965
So even if they spend a few million
on one and lose it,

32:47.108 --> 32:48.872
- it's still worth it.
- Oh, absolutely.

32:49.043 --> 32:51.876
The Colombians have found subs
being built capable of hauling

32:52.046 --> 32:53.844
200 tons of cocaine.

32:54.282 --> 32:58.048
We're talking a street value
approaching the billion-dollar mark.

32:58.219 --> 32:59.846
That's billion with a capital B.

33:00.021 --> 33:03.082
Unfortunately, the only one who would
have known where to find this sub

33:03.257 --> 33:05.658
is now clinging to life
at the USC Burn Center.

33:05.826 --> 33:07.555
If these guys are bringing in
tons of coke,

33:07.728 --> 33:09.696
only a few players can move
that kind of weight.

33:09.864 --> 33:11.904
- Somebody's bound to talk.
- We can help with that.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.525
I can see what kind of chatter
my people have heard.

33:14.702 --> 33:16.693
Eric, go through Charles Anderson's
phone records.

33:16.871 --> 33:18.703
They had to have contacted him
more than once.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.034
Let me see what I can find.

33:20.208 --> 33:22.006
Sam and I will head back
to the Wilson house.

33:22.176 --> 33:24.702
Now that we know what we're
looking for, we may get lucky.

33:25.279 --> 33:26.508
What's the status on Hetty?

33:27.415 --> 33:30.350
She's being called back
to Washington.

33:30.518 --> 33:33.010
Don't ask me why.
I wouldn't tell you if I knew.

33:34.355 --> 33:36.414
I feel like we've had
this conversation before.

33:37.158 --> 33:39.820
Those who ignore the past
are destined to repeat it.

33:41.028 --> 33:42.496
What does that have to do
with Hetty?

33:42.997 --> 33:45.329
- Ask her.
- We're asking you.

33:47.101 --> 33:49.001
You got to be very careful, fellas.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.597
Your fairy godmother isn't
gonna be around to protect you,

33:52.773 --> 33:55.003
so I suggest you get back to work.

33:55.676 --> 33:56.905
We'll talk later.

33:57.545 --> 33:59.206
You can count on that.

34:08.822 --> 34:11.621
- Callen? Sam?
- Where have you been?

34:11.792 --> 34:13.911
I was checking out the two cars
you found at Wilson's.

34:14.061 --> 34:15.790
So one is his, but the other

34:15.963 --> 34:19.364
is being leased by Santa Monica
College student Ali Hanna.

34:19.533 --> 34:21.728
Uh, no relation, I'm guessing?

34:22.737 --> 34:24.466
Any chance
he's a white supremacist?

34:24.639 --> 34:26.266
I don't think so.

34:27.174 --> 34:29.802
Anyway, he's here on a student visa
from Cyprus.

34:29.976 --> 34:31.672
Could be one of the bodies
we found inside.

34:31.846 --> 34:34.507
- Maybe they jacked him for his car.
- That may be.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.743
I looked into the GPS.
Lots of bars and strip clubs.

34:37.918 --> 34:40.751
But what's interesting is
this address in San Pedro.

34:40.920 --> 34:44.083
It's a wet dock rental for ship repair.

34:44.257 --> 34:46.726
But Anderson's sub was assembled
in South America.

34:46.893 --> 34:49.414
And they usually sink them
after they unload the cargo offshore.

34:49.563 --> 34:50.893
Might be worth looking into.

34:51.065 --> 34:52.328
We'll check it out.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.900
- Okay. Thanks.
- Good job, Nell.

35:33.874 --> 35:35.342
We got eyes on this place, Eric?

35:35.743 --> 35:37.336
No. Sorry.

36:25.693 --> 36:26.956
Who's winning?

36:27.128 --> 36:29.256
Federal agents.
Put your hands on your head.

36:29.930 --> 36:31.921
- Anybody else here?
- Go to hell.

36:32.099 --> 36:33.328
Don't say anything.

36:35.035 --> 36:37.060
I blame the video games.

37:06.634 --> 37:08.898
You're not gonna believe
what we're looking at.

37:09.603 --> 37:12.470
- This is going on my Christmas card.
- Eric, we found the sub.

37:12.940 --> 37:15.034
Have Kensi and Deeks
meet us here.

37:15.209 --> 37:17.200
- Got it.
- Alert the harbormaster,

37:17.378 --> 37:19.574
- the Coast Guard and the Navy.
- Copy that.

37:19.747 --> 37:22.375
- You think anyone's on board?
- After you.

37:23.651 --> 37:26.279
You know damn well I'm not going
on that thing. I'll stay here.

37:26.454 --> 37:28.980
Thought you were wearing
your sense-of-adventure pants today.

37:29.156 --> 37:32.217
I don't have a problem with adventure.
I'm not a big fan of confined spaces.

37:46.707 --> 37:47.936
Let me help you with those.

37:50.744 --> 37:54.305
Just the carry-on.
The briefcase stays with me.

39:13.227 --> 39:14.490
G!

39:22.236 --> 39:23.465
Hey.

39:27.841 --> 39:30.401
- G?
- All good.

39:31.946 --> 39:33.505
It's all clear back here.

39:33.681 --> 39:36.514
I think we're a little late. Looks like
the drugs have been loaded out.

39:37.518 --> 39:38.781
- Fertilizer?
- Somebody else

39:38.953 --> 39:40.284
has other plans for this thing.

40:01.075 --> 40:02.941
This whole thing's a giant torpedo.

40:05.245 --> 40:07.976
Eric, we're gonna need
the bomb squad as well.

40:10.317 --> 40:13.150
- Callen, come again?
- You're breaking up.

40:15.756 --> 40:17.417
Agent Callen?

40:19.493 --> 40:21.393
I said, we're gonna need
the bomb squad!

40:24.665 --> 40:26.155
- Better go up topside.
- No.

40:26.333 --> 40:28.734
If anybody's going topside, it's me.

40:31.805 --> 40:33.102
Ahmed?

40:36.677 --> 40:37.906
Ahmed?

40:44.151 --> 40:45.516
They must be on the boat.

40:54.094 --> 40:56.529
Federal agents.
Throw down your weapons.

41:09.109 --> 41:12.135
Ali? We have to leave
before anyone else shows up.

41:12.312 --> 41:13.609
Cast off.

41:17.551 --> 41:19.212
What about Ahmed?

41:20.154 --> 41:21.883
He's dead. Help Ali.

41:22.056 --> 41:23.717
Go. Hurry.

41:26.960 --> 41:28.951
Eric, do you copy?

41:29.730 --> 41:32.495
Eric, do you copy?

41:33.033 --> 41:34.523
Kensi and Deeks are on the way.

41:50.184 --> 41:51.709
That's not good.

41:53.487 --> 41:55.421
Harbormaster,
Coast Guard and Navy

41:55.589 --> 41:57.887
have all been alerted to this vessel
and its location.

41:58.058 --> 41:59.856
You cannot escape.

42:00.928 --> 42:02.760
Neither can you.

42:10.871 --> 42:12.236
Sam?

42:12.406 --> 42:14.397
Callen? Can you hear me?

42:20.247 --> 42:23.182
Agent Blye,
what the hell is going on?

42:28.422 --> 42:30.516
Guys, we're here. Go.

42:37.097 --> 42:38.531
Callen, Sam, do you hear me?

42:41.902 --> 42:43.301
Callen, Sam, do you hear me?
