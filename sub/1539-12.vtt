WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:04.470
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
I wish something would happen
to old man Falcone.

00:04.471 --> 00:05.938
Who would take over then?

00:05.939 --> 00:07.773
Let me guess.

00:07.775 --> 00:09.641
Maroni had nothing to do
with the armory job.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.810
You have a mole, obviously.

00:11.812 --> 00:14.113
<i>Someone close to you.</i>

00:14.115 --> 00:15.115
<i>Arkham Asylum?</i>

00:15.116 --> 00:16.849
<i>Security guard for nut jobs?</i>

00:16.851 --> 00:18.183
Criminal nut jobs, yeah.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.619
Metal needles were inserted
into the brain,

00:20.621 --> 00:22.955
and electricity was applied
to his frontal lobes.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.423
I want you to find out which one

00:24.425 --> 00:26.592
<i>of our inmates did this.</i>

00:26.594 --> 00:28.260
Well done, Aaron.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.929
Exactly like I told you.

00:30.931 --> 00:34.500
Now, you are my
best work so far.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.084 --> 01:26.385
No. No, no.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.454
The merchandise
has got to be mint,

01:28.456 --> 01:30.155
or you won't get a dime.

01:42.469 --> 01:44.770
My God.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.572
Jack.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.440
Hi, Irwin.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.276
Where's my stuff?

01:53.146 --> 01:55.047
Aaron Danzig.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.615
Six-four, 225.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.351
Mental age of a young child.

01:59.353 --> 02:02.654
We believe he's under
the control of this man,

02:02.656 --> 02:04.590
Jack Gruber.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.625
In Arkham
off a rape/murder beef.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.727
We can't find
any records on Gruber

02:08.729 --> 02:10.195
prior to his incarceration,

02:10.197 --> 02:12.264
so we're guessing
Gruber is an alias.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.398
We're sending
his prints nationwide,

02:13.400 --> 02:14.533
see if we can find

02:14.535 --> 02:15.801
another name for him.

02:15.803 --> 02:19.204
Whoever he is,
he's clever and angry

02:19.206 --> 02:21.573
and a grave public menace.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.209
The commissioner
is deeply concerned,

02:24.211 --> 02:25.677
and he's on his way here

02:25.679 --> 02:28.013
to talk to all
of you right now.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.381
You know what that means.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.749
And you know...

02:32.919 --> 02:34.319
Jim?

02:34.321 --> 02:35.420
Captain.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.755
Hey, partner.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.924
Hi.
You're out of
your jurisdiction.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.492
Captain, this is my case.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.394
Jim, you need
to get out of here.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.363
It's my case.
No, no, no.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.764
The captain is right.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.400
You need to leave before
the commissioner gets here.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.601
Why?

02:49.603 --> 02:51.370
Because he holds you responsible
for all of this,

02:51.372 --> 02:52.571
and... oh, fudge.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.039
He's here.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.174
And you're there. Sidestep.

02:58.711 --> 03:00.712
Captain Essen.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.880
Good morning,
Commissioner.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.949
Officer Gordon, isn't it?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.721
Yes, sir.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.691
Why are you here?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.359
I have a better question.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.361
Why are you here, Commissioner?

03:17.297 --> 03:19.565
Excuse me?
This is the first

03:19.567 --> 03:23.101
I've seen you down here
with the rank and file.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.170
You must be desperate.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.106
Follow me.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.511
Really nice knowing you.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.012
Bring you friend Bullock.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.747
I hate you.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.251
I hate you.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.488
It wasn't my idea;
it was your friend.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.957
He came up with
the double-cross,

03:44.959 --> 03:46.425
made me go along.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.560
You have a mind of your own,
don't you?

03:48.562 --> 03:49.728
Hey, come on.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.433
See?

03:54.435 --> 03:56.935
I kept your gadgets safe.

03:57.870 --> 04:00.072
I know what it means to you,

04:00.074 --> 04:01.707
all your experiments.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.775
Oh, I appreciate that.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.247
Please.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.215
You don't have to kill me.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.150
I don't...

04:12.152 --> 04:16.120
have to do anything.

04:16.123 --> 04:18.190
I'm free.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.125
You know the funny thing?

04:20.127 --> 04:23.095
I think it was my time in Arkham
that freed me.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.231
I mean,

04:26.233 --> 04:27.499
in here.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.002
Now I see

04:30.004 --> 04:32.604
the world for what it really is.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.674
An abandoned factory
full of broken machines.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.676
Some...

04:37.678 --> 04:39.978
very few...

04:39.980 --> 04:42.648
Can be fixed.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.284
Most...

04:45.286 --> 04:48.687
just have to be scrapped.

04:48.689 --> 04:51.690
Danzig, hold him, please.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.961
Please.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.363
Please, no, stop. Please.

04:58.365 --> 05:01.733
Please! Please!

05:01.735 --> 05:04.102
Two maniacs on the loose
makes the whole Arkham Project

05:04.104 --> 05:05.270
look kind of shady, huh?

05:05.272 --> 05:07.906
The moneymen want
results fast, I bet.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.042
You're strangely self-righteous,
given that it was you

05:10.044 --> 05:11.677
that let
these men escape.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.812
Blame me all you want.
My name's already mud.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.981
Those two will still be
out there,

05:15.983 --> 05:17.716
and that means you need me.

05:17.718 --> 05:21.219
James, why did you
become a policeman?

05:21.221 --> 05:23.455
Your father was
the district attorney.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.890
A proud station
for a man of substance.

05:24.892 --> 05:25.957
You would think

05:25.959 --> 05:27.492
that would inspire a son

05:27.494 --> 05:28.593
to practice law.

05:28.595 --> 05:29.828
I'm enforcing the law.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.263
You want to talk about my dad

05:31.265 --> 05:32.731
or do you want to catch
Gruber and Danzig?

05:32.733 --> 05:35.000
Where do you get the
rebellious fire in your belly?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.168
Can I take this opportunity

05:36.170 --> 05:39.471
to say that I have
no rebellious fire here, nada.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.239
Jack Gruber is out there,

05:41.241 --> 05:43.308
planning a catastrophe.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.509
I know the man.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.911
I know how he thinks.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.245
I know what he'll do next.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.980
Which is what?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.982
That I'll keep to myself.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.051
I guarantee I'll bring
in these two men,

05:53.053 --> 05:55.253
but first, I need you
to reinstate me

05:55.255 --> 05:57.756
as detective first grade
in the GCPD.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.792
Extortion, Officer Gordon.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.661
24 hours?

06:02.663 --> 06:03.762
What?
You've got 24 hours

06:03.764 --> 06:05.664
to bring these men in.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.299
You don't,
you can both spend the rest

06:07.301 --> 06:08.934
of your miserable careers
down at Arkham.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.002
That will be all, Detectives.

06:15.708 --> 06:16.842
What the hell just happened?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.377
It's okay, it's okay.

06:18.379 --> 06:19.678
Everything's gonna
be fine, Harvey.
Yeah?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.580
Yeah, we just got
to catch the bad guys.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.315
Okay, where are we going?
I don't know.

06:23.317 --> 06:27.986
What? You just told him you knew
what Gruber was gonna do next.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.955
I lied.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.667
Please, Don Falcone,

07:15.669 --> 07:17.135
have mercy.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.403
We're family.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.505
I know, son.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.707
I know it's hard.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.609
A young man like you,

07:24.611 --> 07:26.445
it doesn't seem fair.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.781
Please.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.883
Don Falcone, please!

07:40.693 --> 07:44.763
This whole area used to be slums
when I was a boy.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.199
You've come a long way.

07:47.201 --> 07:50.168
Some of your people are
looking for you, you know.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.871
But you're the one
I wanted to see.

07:55.174 --> 07:59.044
I've worked so long all my life
to get where I am.

07:59.046 --> 08:03.014
So long, I forget why
I wanted to be here.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.217
Well, you wanted
to be someone.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.418
And you are.

08:06.420 --> 08:09.354
Look at all the
stuff you have.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.093
You're a good girl, Liza.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.863
You need to find a young man
and get married,

08:17.865 --> 08:19.564
have babies.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.234
It's not fair of me,
keeping you cooped up here,

08:22.236 --> 08:23.401
doing my housework.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.505
You'll never find
a good husband here.

08:26.507 --> 08:30.108
Anyhow, if you'd like
to get out in the world,

08:30.110 --> 08:32.443
I was thinking
I could set you up

08:32.446 --> 08:36.280
with a bakery or some type
of business like that.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.918
So you can be independent.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.820
That's really nice, Mr. F.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.321
Thank you.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.657
But I would rather
be here with you.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.459
You would?

08:47.461 --> 08:48.894
I like it here.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.831
You make me feel safe.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.733
Well, good.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.902
I like having you here.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.204
Yeah.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.973
Maybe I'll try to get a little
work done before dinner.

09:03.409 --> 09:05.477
I'm making something
special tonight.

09:27.199 --> 09:28.700
What are you laughing at?

09:28.702 --> 09:30.001
Ah, it's good to be back.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.636
Only a man from
a lunatic asylum

09:31.638 --> 09:32.771
would say that.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.039
You're like a human
roller coaster,

09:34.041 --> 09:35.440
except you only go down.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.342
Wouldn't that make him
more of an elevator?

09:37.344 --> 09:38.476
You have anything useful, Ed?

09:38.478 --> 09:39.744
I got a little less
than 20 hours

09:39.746 --> 09:41.212
before I lose my job.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.747
I do... have something useful.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.848
And it is?

09:43.850 --> 09:45.216
I cross-checked fingerprints.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.686
The clinically insane
Jack Gruber

09:47.688 --> 09:49.988
of Arkham is a figment
of the files.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.690
The man himself is really
a career criminal

09:51.692 --> 09:53.892
by the name Jack Buchinsky.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.527
How is that even possible?

09:55.529 --> 09:57.228
Easy enough to bribe someone
to change the records.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.230
Yep, apparently, he wanted
to be transferred to Arkham.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.433
That's really
good work, Ed.

10:01.435 --> 10:02.867
What's this
Buttinsky's deal?

10:02.869 --> 10:05.370
Uh, it's, uh,

10:05.372 --> 10:06.471
Buchinsky.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.540
It's all in the files.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.109
Just make sure you sign it out.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.978
It's classified information,
so just be careful.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.446
Miss Kringle?

10:16.383 --> 10:19.250
I believe you left this
on my desk.

10:19.252 --> 10:20.418
It's a riddle.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.521
It's a cupcake

10:23.523 --> 10:25.924
with a live bullet
sticking out of it.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.058
It's a riddle.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.093
It's menacing

10:28.095 --> 10:30.829
and weird and inedible.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.500
Thank you for the files,
Miss Kringle.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.036
This Buchinsky dude
and his partners

10:38.038 --> 10:39.971
pulled four successful
bank robberies,

10:39.973 --> 10:43.008
killed six along the way
before the GCPD caught him

10:43.010 --> 10:44.242
by accident.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.443
He never named his accomplices.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.578
He's in prison,

10:46.580 --> 10:48.346
he hears Arkham
is opening its doors,

10:48.348 --> 10:50.348
so he uses his connections,

10:50.350 --> 10:51.983
and he gets himself
a new identity

10:51.985 --> 10:53.918
as the mental patient Gruber.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.253
He must have some
good connections.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.088
Right, and when the rest
of the nuts get transferred

10:57.090 --> 10:58.256
to Arkham... voilà.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.258
So, he had
partners, huh?

11:00.260 --> 11:01.660
Yeah, GCPD never
identified them.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.827
They're still
out there.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.630
Yep, we find them,
we'll find him.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.033
Easy enough, huh?

11:08.035 --> 11:09.968
Detective.

11:10.936 --> 11:12.937
A hit.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.376
What do we got?

11:18.378 --> 11:20.712
Lead detectives dusted
for prints, two sets...

11:20.714 --> 11:22.747
Gruber and Danzig,
just like we thought.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.783
Right. Thanks.
All right.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.652
Van checks out.

11:27.654 --> 11:30.689
It was them.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.857
Our man's an electronics
freak, right?

11:32.859 --> 11:34.926
Yeah.

11:37.129 --> 11:39.197
Think he went
shopping?

11:58.250 --> 12:00.251
He's dead.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.053
Fried like a doughnut.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.901
GCPD.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.970
Turn around slowly,
let me see those hands.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.907
Hey.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.911
Hey, buddy.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.980
Hey. Hey!

12:54.107 --> 12:55.440
Help, help! Please!

12:55.442 --> 12:57.442
Get back in the store.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.810
Okay. Take it easy. Okay.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.615
Please, there's been
a terrible mistake.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.917
I am Don Falcone's housekeeper.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.619
Fish?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.454
Thank God.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.456
Why'd you have to pull
me out like that?

13:11.458 --> 13:12.924
You scared the
life out of me.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.592
It's time, Liza.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.895
I'm gonna make
my move on Falcone.

13:16.897 --> 13:19.030
And don't be scared,
baby girl.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.799
I got this.

13:27.773 --> 13:29.641
Mr. Falcone,

13:29.643 --> 13:31.810
we have your girl, Liza.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.812
Would you like to see her again?

13:33.814 --> 13:35.313
Yes, I would.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.215
She'll be glad to hear that.

13:37.217 --> 13:41.119
For a fit young woman,
she has a low pain threshold.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.821
Please! No!

13:42.823 --> 13:44.489
Stop!

13:44.491 --> 13:48.159
An intermediary will be
in contact with you soon.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.161
Don't hurt her.
She's a civilian.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.631
Hello?

14:01.373 --> 14:03.641
What now?

14:03.643 --> 14:07.345
Now we let him sit and think
about his life for a while.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.461
"The Electrocutioner."

14:23.463 --> 14:24.596
Cute.

14:24.598 --> 14:25.763
No pressure.

14:25.765 --> 14:27.098
Don't worry, we'll get him.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.533
Yeah, and we got 17 hours
to do so.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.535
I love the name.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.202
It's catchy, has drama.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.438
The Electro-cutioner.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.440
Speaking of which, given
the general mode of attack,

14:35.442 --> 14:38.476
may I suggest you
both wear your...

14:38.478 --> 14:40.345
department-issue galoshes
while you're out in the field.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.679
Galoshes?

14:41.681 --> 14:44.315
In the event of
electrical misadventure,

14:44.317 --> 14:46.050
your footwear should
be insulated.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.218
No, Mom!

14:47.220 --> 14:49.020
I'm not gonna wear
my rubbers on the case.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.089
Nygma, give 'em here.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.458
Seriously?

14:58.764 --> 15:00.765
All right,
so what do we know?

15:00.767 --> 15:03.601
Gruber wasn't too happy
with Irwin.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.937
Maybe they were partners in
crime, Irwin turned on him,

15:05.939 --> 15:07.272
Gruber took the fall.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.306
Detective Gordon.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.742
Dr. Thompkins.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.744
My friends call me Lee.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.146
Congratulations, you
got your job back.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.148
Or not, depending.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.282
It's good to see you.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.416
Is it?

15:20.252 --> 15:21.886
I-I know you're caught
up with the escape.

15:21.888 --> 15:22.888
That's why I'm here.

15:22.889 --> 15:23.889
Is everything okay?

15:23.890 --> 15:25.723
Must be chaos down there.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.525
We're getting by just fine.
Thanks for asking.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.729
Oh, right, this is my
partner, Harvey Bullock.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.064
<i>Hola.</i>

15:33.066 --> 15:34.499
Detective Bullock.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.833
Who's your little
friend there?

15:35.835 --> 15:37.468
Oh, this is
why I'm here.

15:37.470 --> 15:39.570
One of the women in my
wing is a pagan sorceress.

15:39.572 --> 15:40.572
Of course.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.206
She's very popular.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.875
The inmates make dolls
to look like people

15:43.877 --> 15:45.243
that they want to curse.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.345
And then they give it to
the sorceress to curse them.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.013
In exchange for extra
soda and candy.

15:49.015 --> 15:50.882
I curse you all the time.
You never give me candy.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.283
I asked her if Gruber

15:52.285 --> 15:53.952
had ever given her
a doll to curse,

15:53.954 --> 15:55.253
and she said yes.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.421
This is the doll.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.022
His name is Mr. M.

15:58.024 --> 16:01.025
You owe me for a double
six-pack of root beer.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.060
Mr. M.?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.394
Mr. M.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.729
Mr. M.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.799
Who does this
look like to you?

16:07.801 --> 16:09.434
<i>I tell this guy,
I said, "Maurice...</i>

16:09.436 --> 16:11.102
"we've pulled out half
your freaking teeth.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.603
"What the hell are
you waiting for?

16:12.605 --> 16:14.005
The tooth fairy?" Right?

16:22.281 --> 16:23.514
So, what he does...

16:23.516 --> 16:25.116
you know what Maurice does?
He smiles at me.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.384
So I say, "I'm
gonna take out

16:26.386 --> 16:27.852
another one, man."
I go to his molar.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.321
I got to get Mario and Gabe
to help me pull it out.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.522
Do excuse me.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.057
Right.
So, we're, like, pulling it,

16:33.059 --> 16:34.192
we're pulling it, right?

16:34.194 --> 16:35.526
And finally
we get it out.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.195
The thing is this big...

16:37.197 --> 16:38.262
Yes.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.330
Come see me.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.398
I need you.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.466
I'm on my way.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.134
What's wrong?

16:43.136 --> 16:44.469
Somebody took Liza.

16:44.471 --> 16:45.837
Come, quickly.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.813
You sly devil.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.816
You took her.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.885
You're mine now.

17:03.822 --> 17:06.324
So I'm trying to tell
this guy, "Let him talk."

17:06.326 --> 17:08.859
Because now he's trying to talk,
but now I don't understand him

17:08.862 --> 17:10.328
'cause he's got no teeth, right?

17:10.329 --> 17:12.195
So I'm saying,
"Let him talk. Clean him out.

17:12.198 --> 17:13.798
He's gonna tell us something."

17:13.800 --> 17:17.468
Don Maroni, sir, forgive me.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.470
Such fun we're having.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.739
But I regret
that I must run away.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.808
If you'll let me.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.209
My mother is sick.

17:26.845 --> 17:28.579
Well, a sick mother's
a sick mother.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.648
Go.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.496
Hey...

17:45.498 --> 17:46.931
Penguin, you all right?

17:46.933 --> 17:48.599
Whoa.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.134
Hey, kid, what
are you...?

17:50.136 --> 17:51.502
What's going on here?

17:54.139 --> 17:55.406
Get down!

18:12.658 --> 18:14.325
I don't know what happened.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.993
It was like a silent bomb.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.595
You know who
did this, right?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.263
Who?

18:19.265 --> 18:20.798
A few years ago,
Jack Buchinsky

18:20.800 --> 18:23.167
and partners unknown
knocked over four banks.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.036
Killed six people.

18:25.038 --> 18:26.537
Buchinsky went
down for life.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.874
His partners were
never caught.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.043
You're one of
those partners.

18:32.045 --> 18:35.179
The one that took his share and
sold him up the river, I expect.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.548
What guy was this?

18:37.550 --> 18:39.217
Bu... uh...

18:39.219 --> 18:41.219
Who?

18:41.221 --> 18:43.554
While he's out there
looking to hurt you,

18:43.556 --> 18:46.557
he doesn't care
who else he hurts.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.559
Women, kids.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.727
Hey.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.229
That's not my fault.

18:53.198 --> 18:55.266
Help me do the right
thing here, Don Maroni.

18:57.202 --> 19:00.438
Let me place you in
protective custody.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.440
Protective custody?

19:02.442 --> 19:03.508
Yes.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.675
Bait, you mean.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.112
We catch our bad guy,

19:08.114 --> 19:09.614
you get rid of a
dangerous nuisance.

19:09.616 --> 19:10.781
We both come
out ahead.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.783
Excuse me.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.452
Hello?

19:14.454 --> 19:16.587
I... must be going.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.823
Very urgent business.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.892
W-W-With Falcone.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.209
All right, make
yourself at home.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.652
Hey, sweetheart.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.819
Get me a double espresso.

19:48.821 --> 19:49.821
Extra sugar.

19:49.822 --> 19:50.888
Nah.

20:20.519 --> 20:22.353
I'm Barbara.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.356
Barbara Kean.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.291
My parents, they live here.

20:37.669 --> 20:40.671
It's very nice to
see you, Barbara.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.673
Isn't it, Everett?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.676
Yes, very nice.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.813
It's nice
to see you, too.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.749
You've been well, I hope?

20:51.751 --> 20:54.085
Yes.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.353
And you?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.988
Splendid.

20:58.457 --> 21:00.024
Are you staying the night?

21:01.326 --> 21:03.494
Uh, if that's
all right.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.830
In fact, um...

21:05.832 --> 21:07.865
I-I thought maybe
I could stay a few days.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.934
If that's...

21:11.870 --> 21:14.005
Oh, I see.

21:14.007 --> 21:16.007
Yes, of course.

21:16.009 --> 21:19.343
I'm sure you're going
to be frightfully bored.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.679
But stay until
the weekend.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.848
By all means.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.850
Thank you.

21:25.852 --> 21:28.452
How's that young
man of yours?

21:28.454 --> 21:30.121
James?

21:30.123 --> 21:32.123
The policeman?

21:32.125 --> 21:33.557
All well, I hope?

21:33.559 --> 21:36.560
Yes.

21:36.562 --> 21:39.196
He's well, thank you.

21:39.198 --> 21:42.099
Good.

21:42.101 --> 21:45.303
We're very happy.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.371
Very happy.

21:55.381 --> 21:56.814
You guys are, like,
hungry for this.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.482
What do you guys do here
for excitement?

21:58.484 --> 22:00.418
Remember that joke
about the, uh, what is it?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.953
The two cops and the undertaker
that go on a fishing boat.

22:02.955 --> 22:04.822
When you use
a tethered goat as bait,

22:04.824 --> 22:08.092
shouldn't the goat be out in
the jungle and not in the house?

22:08.094 --> 22:11.729
This house is the
best-defended spot in Gotham.

22:11.731 --> 22:15.499
Buchinsky is crazy and
arrogant and resourceful.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.235
Wherever Maroni is,
he'll come after him.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.371
He'll enjoy the challenge.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.844
Hey, there.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.679
Hi... hi, boss.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.414
How long have I
been unconscious?

22:30.416 --> 22:31.716
Couple of hours.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.384
Oh, my gosh.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.752
I-I must go.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.153
My-my poor mother...

22:37.122 --> 22:39.123
Your mother can wait.

22:41.127 --> 22:43.394
It's her heart, poor thing.

22:43.396 --> 22:44.829
Valves.

22:44.831 --> 22:48.232
She-she might be
taken at any moment...

22:50.369 --> 22:52.603
But... but,
by all means,

22:52.605 --> 22:55.272
of course, she can wait.

22:55.274 --> 22:57.141
When you woke up before,

22:57.143 --> 23:00.378
you said you had
urgent business...

23:02.381 --> 23:04.382
...with Falcone.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.951
I did?

23:06.953 --> 23:08.953
I said that?

23:08.955 --> 23:11.455
Did I?

23:23.268 --> 23:25.436
Carmine?

23:25.438 --> 23:29.173
Some people have called me
about your girl Liza.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.542
They want me
to help make a deal.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.580
I didn't think
it was going to be you.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.249
I'm sorry.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.918
I'm just an intermediary.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.586
I just want to help.

23:42.588 --> 23:43.821
Please, my dear.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.222
Stop.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.024
I know this is you.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.560
Be honest.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.028
It's me.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.030
Of course it is.

23:53.032 --> 23:56.033
How long have I known you?

23:56.035 --> 23:58.002
You're the smart one
in the family.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.703
Didn't I always say so?

23:59.705 --> 24:01.705
She won't be hurt.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.040
Leave Gotham.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.942
That's all... leave Gotham,

24:04.944 --> 24:06.076
never come back.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.745
You can take her with you.

24:13.485 --> 24:15.286
Agreed.

24:15.288 --> 24:16.353
That's the right decision.

24:16.355 --> 24:19.256
I'll make the arrangements.

24:19.258 --> 24:22.193
You were always my favorite.

24:22.195 --> 24:25.563
Wait for my call.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.198
He's leaving?

24:27.200 --> 24:29.266
You did it?

24:31.704 --> 24:33.170
Boss?

24:33.172 --> 24:35.773
The genius! The-the vision!

24:35.775 --> 24:39.577
You brought down
the old man... finally.

24:40.545 --> 24:42.079
Let's celebrate.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.417
Butch, this is not
the time to celebrate.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.954
He was a great man once.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.857
You don't think somebody would
take him out if he stayed on?

24:52.859 --> 24:56.393
I am doing him a favor
and giving him an easy way out.

24:58.797 --> 25:02.666
I owe him at least that.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.335
Of course.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.237
You're right.

25:06.239 --> 25:08.072
It's best for everyone.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.442
How did he sound?

25:14.679 --> 25:16.947
Sad.

25:18.283 --> 25:20.384
Look at me.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.254
Is there something
you're not telling me?

25:23.256 --> 25:25.089
No.

25:26.791 --> 25:28.659
You're going to have
to leave town with him,

25:28.661 --> 25:30.227
string him along for a while.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.795
Do you think
you can do that?

25:31.797 --> 25:33.230
Sure.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.431
Sure.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.801
But you like him, though,
don't you?

25:37.803 --> 25:40.504
Well, I can like him, can't I?

25:41.540 --> 25:44.241
He's been
a perfect gentleman.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.477
He could've done anything,

25:46.479 --> 25:49.213
and he never laid a hand on me.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.082
Liza, you can like
him all you want.

25:52.084 --> 25:55.786
But you can never
tell him the truth.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.389
I know that.

26:06.131 --> 26:08.465
Sir?

26:08.467 --> 26:10.801
Let me go to work.

26:12.003 --> 26:14.071
No.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.874
"No"?

26:16.876 --> 26:18.609
If Fish and the others...

26:18.611 --> 26:22.079
and there must be others...

26:22.081 --> 26:24.315
if they all want me
to step away so badly,

26:24.317 --> 26:26.317
maybe it's time.

26:26.319 --> 26:29.887
Why not?

26:29.889 --> 26:33.557
Why am I still here fighting?

26:33.559 --> 26:36.660
For what?

26:36.662 --> 26:39.697
For respect.

26:39.699 --> 26:43.467
You're Don Carmine Falcone.

26:43.469 --> 26:44.735
"Respect"?

26:44.737 --> 26:48.672
Who cares?

26:48.674 --> 26:50.207
They all want me

26:50.209 --> 26:53.143
to go live in the country
with Liza.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.379
I would like that.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.482
That's what I want, too.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.918
So, why not do it?

27:02.587 --> 27:05.122
Please...

27:05.124 --> 27:07.391
don't talk that way, sir.

27:10.062 --> 27:12.496
And just me on my own?

27:12.498 --> 27:15.299
I can take out Fish's crew easy.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.001
You're not
listening, Victor.

27:17.969 --> 27:22.373
Your job is to keep
me and Liza safe

27:22.375 --> 27:24.475
through the coming transaction.

27:24.477 --> 27:26.477
That's all.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.545
Yes, sir.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.593
Miss Kringle?

27:42.595 --> 27:45.262
What?! What?

27:45.264 --> 27:48.432
The cupcake is sweet,
the bullet is deadly.

27:48.434 --> 27:50.901
A beautiful woman's
a dangerous thing.

27:53.838 --> 27:56.273
Um, uh, listen, I, uh...

27:56.275 --> 27:58.876
That is so...

27:58.878 --> 28:00.577
I don't...

28:00.579 --> 28:02.446
I don't even know
what to say to that.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.515
Nygma, you perv, back off.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.483
Can't you see the lady
doesn't want you bugging her?

28:06.485 --> 28:08.185
I, um...

28:08.187 --> 28:10.054
Hey, there. Hey, now.
Who's bugging who?

28:10.056 --> 28:11.889
I'm just, I'm just...

28:11.891 --> 28:13.424
What's green and then red?

28:13.426 --> 28:14.858
Frogs in a blender.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.261
Walk away, Nygma.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.463
Walk away.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.200
I'm very sorry if I've
offended you, Miss Kringle.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.335
That was not my intention.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.275
Do you hear that?

28:31.277 --> 28:32.676
Go.

28:36.514 --> 28:38.048
Thank you.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.851
He is so weird.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.516
I have no business with Falcone!

29:12.518 --> 29:14.184
I swear on my mother's life!

29:14.186 --> 29:16.820
May God strike her dead
with horrible torment

29:16.822 --> 29:18.422
if I'm lying!

29:18.424 --> 29:20.357
Okay, then, my friend.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.093
I'm sorry I doubted you.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.728
Go see your mom.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.663
Give her a kiss for me.

29:26.665 --> 29:28.732
Thank you.

30:46.244 --> 30:47.811
Ah.

30:47.813 --> 30:49.479
There's the one.

30:49.481 --> 30:52.015
Under that funny-looking
fellow there.

30:53.285 --> 30:56.119
Take him to the truck.

30:58.723 --> 30:59.823
They didn't cook.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.725
Just stunned.

31:01.727 --> 31:04.127
I expected more...

31:04.129 --> 31:05.996
oomph!

31:07.265 --> 31:10.200
You want "oomph," Jack?

31:10.202 --> 31:12.402
Ah.

31:12.404 --> 31:15.873
Officer Gordon.

31:15.875 --> 31:18.075
Nice shoes.

31:18.077 --> 31:21.211
Detective Gordon.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.080
Hands up, both of you.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.516
Uh, you might want to drop that.

31:30.788 --> 31:33.557
Aah!

31:40.632 --> 31:43.000
Why fight me, Gordon?

31:43.002 --> 31:44.735
Who here

31:44.737 --> 31:47.204
deserves your protection?

31:47.206 --> 31:48.672
Any of them?
All of them.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.407
Even Maroni?! Please!

31:50.409 --> 31:53.844
Just let me kill
this false friend

31:53.846 --> 31:56.580
and get on with my life.

32:05.056 --> 32:06.823
All this fight.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.892
And for what?

32:13.331 --> 32:16.033
I'm putting you
back in Arkham, Jack.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.068
That's closer to the mark,
now, isn't it, Jim?

32:18.070 --> 32:19.770
You need to win.

32:19.772 --> 32:22.339
Don't you? You pretend
to care about the law,

32:22.341 --> 32:24.908
but in your heart,
it's all primitive ego.

32:24.910 --> 32:28.645
And you lust
for blood and power.

32:28.647 --> 32:32.516
You just hate to lose.

32:32.518 --> 32:33.750
You know what?

32:33.752 --> 32:34.818
You're right.

32:41.826 --> 32:44.161
I do hate to lose.

32:46.898 --> 32:48.932
Hmm.

32:59.444 --> 33:02.212
Congratulations,
young man.

33:02.214 --> 33:04.281
A new day.

33:05.249 --> 33:06.683
New day.

33:07.852 --> 33:11.054
Next man that tries to
take away my shield...

33:11.056 --> 33:12.656
one way or another,

33:12.658 --> 33:14.725
I'm gonna make him eat it.

33:16.361 --> 33:17.961
Say again?

33:17.963 --> 33:20.030
New day, Commissioner.

33:31.976 --> 33:34.578
I hope you have some
nasty pictures of him,

33:34.580 --> 33:35.779
because I bet

33:35.781 --> 33:38.115
what you said was very,
very rude.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.717
I'm done being careful.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.786
You think you've
been careful so far?

33:42.788 --> 33:45.055
Men like Commissioner Loeb
are never gonna trust me.

33:45.057 --> 33:46.790
You think you've been careful
so far?

33:46.792 --> 33:48.058
So why play nice?

33:48.060 --> 33:49.226
You think...

33:49.228 --> 33:51.094
you've been careful so far?

33:51.096 --> 33:52.229
Don't worry.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.430
I know what I'm doing.

33:53.432 --> 33:54.898
Let's go grab
a beer.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.566
Now you're messing with my mind.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.469
I need something
stronger than a beer.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.847
Hush, young man.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.449
I can hear you sigh.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.120
Sorry, sir.

34:25.963 --> 34:27.397
Let him be.

34:37.507 --> 34:39.109
It's good to see you,
old friend.

34:39.110 --> 34:43.080
I am so sorry it took me
so long to get here.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.014
Such a day I've had...

34:45.016 --> 34:46.783
I won't even tell you.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.085
But I'm here.

34:49.088 --> 34:51.755
You were right about Fish.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.690
It's her that's taken Liza.

34:53.692 --> 34:57.260
Sir, allow me...

34:57.262 --> 34:59.129
I must tell you
what I've discovered.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.599
You're not gonna
want to hear this.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.934
Speak.

35:03.936 --> 35:06.837
Liza was planted on you by Fish.

35:08.339 --> 35:10.974
She belongs to Fish.

35:10.976 --> 35:13.910
This was a setup from the start.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.313
She found a girl that looked
just like your mother,

35:16.315 --> 35:17.881
and trained her up...

35:20.118 --> 35:21.985
No.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.787
I'm sorry.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.622
Prove that.
How?

35:25.624 --> 35:28.758
I-I can't.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.127
I just know.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.563
You're wrong.

35:33.565 --> 35:36.700
When have I been wrong?

35:47.478 --> 35:49.246
Hello, Fish.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.947
Don Falcone.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.816
We will meet at my place.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.284
Acceptable?

35:54.286 --> 35:56.286
Yes.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.054
Is she there? Is Liza there now?

35:58.056 --> 35:59.189
Can I speak to her?

35:59.191 --> 36:00.757
No.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.959
What time?

36:02.961 --> 36:05.028
In an hour.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.365
I'll be there.

36:28.753 --> 36:29.920
Fish.

36:29.922 --> 36:32.389
Don Falcone.

36:35.326 --> 36:37.027
How's this work?

36:37.029 --> 36:38.528
Liza is close by.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.331
All I need for you to do
is sign papers...

36:41.333 --> 36:43.767
relinquish all control
of the family...

36:43.769 --> 36:46.036
and then you're both
free to leave.

36:46.038 --> 36:47.837
Papers?

36:47.839 --> 36:49.806
You think papers make a don?

36:51.108 --> 36:53.109
I'm offering you a way out,
Carmine.

36:53.111 --> 36:54.544
I appreciate that.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.213
Thank you.

36:56.215 --> 36:58.114
But I need to see her first.

36:58.116 --> 36:59.916
Before I sign anything,

36:59.918 --> 37:01.585
I need to know
she's all right.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.752
She's fine.

37:04.121 --> 37:05.956
I need to see her.

37:05.958 --> 37:07.824
Or no deal.

37:28.613 --> 37:30.313
Are you all right?

37:30.315 --> 37:32.015
I'm okay.

37:33.451 --> 37:36.219
How long have you known
Fish Mooney?

37:36.221 --> 37:38.822
Huh?

37:38.824 --> 37:40.023
I don't.

37:40.025 --> 37:42.959
I just met her now.

37:44.428 --> 37:45.428
No.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.831
A little bird
told me you and she

37:47.833 --> 37:50.033
have been friends for a while.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.435
No.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.038
Told me that she told you
stuff about my mother

37:55.040 --> 37:57.907
so that I'd get
all caught up in you.

37:57.909 --> 38:00.210
Because
Fish knows.

38:00.212 --> 38:01.911
You know,
about my mother.

38:03.214 --> 38:06.316
You know how much
I loved my mother,

38:06.318 --> 38:07.684
because we talked about her

38:07.686 --> 38:09.753
all the time,
you and me.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.788
Remember, Fish?
Back in the day?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.390
I do.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.991
It seems as though a little bird

38:14.993 --> 38:16.526
has been making
a bit of mischief.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.395
Yes.

38:18.397 --> 38:20.964
That's what I had hoped.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.033
But the truth is plain to see.

38:23.035 --> 38:25.835
I am very disappointed
at my own stupidity.

38:43.954 --> 38:45.155
I'm sorry, Liza.

38:45.157 --> 38:46.489
Is that your name?

38:48.225 --> 38:49.492
I'm sorry
you had to get

38:49.494 --> 38:51.895
mixed up in this,

38:51.897 --> 38:53.730
because I'm sure you're a...

38:53.732 --> 38:57.000
good, honest girl,
really.

39:09.747 --> 39:11.815
No.

39:44.582 --> 39:47.016
I want these two
alive for now.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.585
Lock them up someplace.

39:48.587 --> 39:51.121
Don't bother
yelling for help.

39:51.123 --> 39:52.589
All your people are dead.

39:52.591 --> 39:53.923
Carmine...

39:53.925 --> 39:55.325
you have
to under...

39:56.260 --> 39:58.461
I can forgive

39:58.463 --> 39:59.963
all kinds of betrayal

39:59.965 --> 40:02.365
and dishonesty.

40:02.367 --> 40:03.700
But my mother?

40:03.702 --> 40:05.802
How dare you use

40:05.804 --> 40:07.804
my sainted mother
against me?

40:07.806 --> 40:09.572
That's wrong!

40:09.574 --> 40:11.641
You'll suffer
for that.
I need you to...

40:14.078 --> 40:16.813
Thank you, Fish.

40:16.815 --> 40:17.981
For the first time

40:17.983 --> 40:19.315
in a long time,

40:19.317 --> 40:21.418
I feel alive.

40:21.420 --> 40:23.820
I remember who I am.

40:23.822 --> 40:26.790
I remember
why I'm here.

40:26.792 --> 40:29.292
Just...
You can come out now.

40:40.304 --> 40:42.505
Right, as usual,
my friend.

40:44.742 --> 40:47.677
Say your good-byes quickly.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.746
Ms. Mooney has
places to go.

41:01.992 --> 41:04.461
Hello, Fish.

41:31.455 --> 41:32.689
Hi.

41:32.691 --> 41:35.024
Dr. Thompkins.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.659
Lee.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.497
Lee.

41:41.765 --> 41:44.667
The desk sergeant said
it was okay to come back here.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.102
I didn't mean to disturb you.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.203
No, no.

41:47.205 --> 41:48.271
It's okay.
Something wrong?

41:48.273 --> 41:49.273
No.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.140
Um, I was in the area,

41:51.142 --> 41:54.110
and, um... my sorceress
wants her doll back.

41:54.112 --> 41:56.913
Right, yeah.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.781
Is that why you're here?

41:58.783 --> 42:01.317
Yes.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.855
No.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.658
She does want her
doll back, but, um...

42:08.660 --> 42:10.860
Not entirely.

42:10.862 --> 42:12.161
No.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.401
You live here?

42:19.370 --> 42:21.905
Sort of between places
right now.

42:23.742 --> 42:26.509
I don't know why I'm here.

42:26.511 --> 42:27.677
Sorry.

42:27.679 --> 42:30.079
A whim.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.316
Wait.

43:02.012 --> 43:04.147
Hey, Gordon,
did you hear?

43:06.183 --> 43:08.751
There's been a big shootout
at Fish Mooney's place.

43:09.305 --> 43:15.563
