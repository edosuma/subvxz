WEBVTT

00:14.580 --> 00:17.743
Yo, Duke.

00:17.780 --> 00:19.543
Turn down the TV.

00:19.580 --> 00:22.185
Your paper's here.

00:22.220 --> 00:24.211
(cartoon sound effects play
over TV)

00:25.850 --> 00:27.351
Duke.

00:27.390 --> 00:28.482
It's Heather.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.056
Duke.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.588
Hey, Stevie.

00:32.630 --> 00:35.155
Hey, kid. Where's your old man?

00:35.200 --> 00:36.565
I coloring.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.591
That's nice.

00:38.630 --> 00:40.029
Duke.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.807
Duke.

01:02.890 --> 01:05.552
WOMAN:
Carrie.

01:05.590 --> 01:06.818
Phyllis....

01:06.860 --> 01:09.397
Hello. How's the
Gramercy Park round table

01:09.430 --> 01:10.658
doing this afternoon?
Doing well.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.168
Doing well, Carrie.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.531
All right.

01:14.570 --> 01:16.435
Yeah.
Great day.
Mm-hmm.

01:16.470 --> 01:19.371
What's going on here

01:20.610 --> 01:22.805
You look like you
swallowed a canary.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.279
I swallowed a swallow once.

01:25.310 --> 01:26.311
WOMAN:
Oh.
Get it?

01:26.350 --> 01:27.612
I do get it.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.686
And I also get exactly
what is going on

01:29.720 --> 01:31.711
right here, right now.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.411
You want to test
my supersonic, unbeatable

01:33.460 --> 01:34.688
memory skills again, don't you?

01:34.720 --> 01:36.551
Fine.

01:36.590 --> 01:38.285
Give me a date.

01:38.330 --> 01:39.456
Nope.
Not this time, Carrie.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.728
Nah, it's too easy.

01:40.760 --> 01:41.590
What about your birthdays?

01:41.630 --> 01:43.222
No. We've been there,
we've done that.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.419
We got something harder
for you this time.

01:44.470 --> 01:45.892
Oh, all right.
What, anniversaries?

01:45.930 --> 01:48.592
What did we have
for lunch, Carrie?

01:48.640 --> 01:50.198
You guys have the same thing
for lunch every day.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.207
This isn't hard.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.605
We're waiting.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.198
Oh... here we go.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.707
Here we go.

01:55.740 --> 01:56.741
Phyllis,
toasted pumpernickel

01:56.780 --> 01:58.179
with honey turkey.

01:58.210 --> 01:59.472
Abner, whitefish salad

01:59.520 --> 02:00.509
on a roll.

02:00.550 --> 02:02.211
Gerta, you had...

02:02.250 --> 02:04.286
brisket from Morty's
with slaw on the side.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.254
Florence, PB and J
with the crusts cut off.

02:06.290 --> 02:08.349
Harold had his
chicken cutlet.

02:08.390 --> 02:10.153
And Barry had his
perennial favorite,

02:10.190 --> 02:11.327
chopped liver on rye,

02:11.360 --> 02:12.395
one new pickle on the side.

02:12.430 --> 02:13.749
Gotcha.
What?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.392
I ordered
two pickles today.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.522
Oh. We got her.

02:16.570 --> 02:17.764
We got her.

02:19.470 --> 02:21.358
But you didn't eat
the second one, did you, Barry?

02:21.400 --> 02:22.628
You're taking that
home to Doris.

02:22.670 --> 02:24.365
Come on,
you know I'm right.

02:27.410 --> 02:29.275
Thank you very much,

02:29.310 --> 02:30.504
ladies and gentlemen.
I'll be here all week.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.211
Yeah. Well...
we're gonna get you

02:32.250 --> 02:33.774
one of these days,
Carrie Wells.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.469
Don't hold your breath.

02:35.520 --> 02:36.942
Especially you, Florence.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.685
Hey, Al.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.278
On my way.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.321
Victim's Duke Callahan,
Coast Guard.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.497
Shouldn't the local PD
be handling this?

02:53.540 --> 02:55.667
You'd think, but because of
his security clearance

02:55.700 --> 02:57.463
and his training
in explosives,

02:57.510 --> 02:58.932
Coast Guard wanted us
to work the case.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.608
Wallet's still here,

03:00.640 --> 03:03.507
does not
look like a robbery.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.245
Building manager found
Callahan's kid

03:05.280 --> 03:07.271
in the living room.
Ex-wife's on her way.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.242
Time of death was only
about two hours ago.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.751
Single gunshot wound
to the back of the head.

03:12.790 --> 03:15.384
Not your...

03:15.420 --> 03:17.627
typical pissed off lover
or neighbor.

03:17.660 --> 03:19.548
This_.
was efﬁCIent.

03:19.600 --> 03:20.794
Execution style.

03:20.830 --> 03:23.219
Wouldn't really give it
style points.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.498
CARRIE:
What about the little boy?

03:24.530 --> 03:26.896
Did he see anything?

03:26.940 --> 03:28.430
AL:
He's only three;

03:28.470 --> 03:30.404
he's too young
to tell us anything.

03:32.610 --> 03:33.577
I don't think Stevie
saw anything.

03:33.610 --> 03:34.770
I didn't either.

03:34.810 --> 03:36.846
It blows my mind.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.245
In this building.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.679
Duke...

03:39.720 --> 03:41.517
Single dad...
loved the kid...

03:41.550 --> 03:43.313
never bitched.

03:43.350 --> 03:44.510
Except when his rent

03:44.550 --> 03:46.711
got raised.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.582
Hey... Stevie.

03:50.630 --> 03:51.983
Hi, Stevie.

03:52.030 --> 03:53.258
What's that?

03:53.300 --> 03:54.824
I coloring.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.997
You coloring?

03:56.030 --> 03:57.588
What's that there?
What you got?

03:57.630 --> 04:00.565
A doggy.
A doggy?

04:00.600 --> 04:02.864
Wow... that's, um...

04:02.910 --> 04:04.332
Another one.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.769
Where did he get this?

04:09.810 --> 04:11.607
He's been playing with it
since I got here.

04:11.650 --> 04:12.617
What's the big deal?

04:12.650 --> 04:14.515
Hey, Stevie.

04:14.550 --> 04:15.619
Hey, guess what I saw outside.

04:15.650 --> 04:16.810
An ice cream truck.

04:16.850 --> 04:18.545
You want to go get one?
Come on, then.

04:18.590 --> 04:20.478
Yeah.
Oh... that'll be fun.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.589
Come on.

04:21.620 --> 04:22.882
I need you to get
out of here now.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.626
What's going on?
Just do it.

04:25.660 --> 04:26.888
Take them out of here right now.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.557
Go.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.794
I thought Stevie was
playing with Play-Doh;

04:29.830 --> 04:32.060
it's a block of
C-4 explosive.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.761
This whole place
could be wired to blow.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.358
Everyone,
shut down your phones.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.765
Shut down your radios.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.903
We found C-4, we got to
clear this building. Now.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.419
It was so scary.
I understand...

05:03.470 --> 05:05.324
Building's clear.

05:05.370 --> 05:07.634
It's just
a single brick of C-4.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.035
So far all we got
on Callahan,

05:09.070 --> 05:10.731
he's a Coast Guard
gunner's mate.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.931
Divorced for a year,
they share custody of the kid.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.676
Why's this guy sitting
on a brick of explosives?

05:15.710 --> 05:17.109
I don't know. Maybe
your sweet single dad's

05:17.150 --> 05:18.606
a homegrown terrorist
who got himself killed.

05:18.650 --> 05:21.972
Not every extremist
bangs out a manifesto.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.988
WOMAN :
Stevie, Stevie.

05:25.390 --> 05:27.358
Stevie.

05:27.390 --> 05:28.482
This the mom?

05:28.520 --> 05:29.851
Yeah, Callahan's ex-wife,

05:29.890 --> 05:31.585
coming to pick
up the kid.

05:31.630 --> 05:33.427
Check her alibi.
And let's canvass the building.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.826
Everyone with access
to that laundry room.

05:35.860 --> 05:38.090
Go.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.997
Are you okay?

05:43.910 --> 05:46.799
Ijust... I can't
believe he's gone.

05:46.840 --> 05:51.470
I know this is hard, Debbie,
but I

05:51.510 --> 05:54.411
Was anything bothering
Duke lately?

05:54.450 --> 05:56.077
I don't...
I don't think so.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.940
I mean, he worked
way too hard,

05:57.990 --> 05:59.855
butthatsit

05:59.890 --> 06:03.656
What about enemies, anyone
who might want to hurt him?

06:03.690 --> 06:06.921
Duke hung out with a couple
of thugs when-when he was a kid

06:06.960 --> 06:09.428
in the Bronx, but

06:09.470 --> 06:10.960
he joined the Guard
right out of high school.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.798
He... He helped people.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.728
Why did you two get divorced?

06:15.770 --> 06:18.967
Um, Duke and me had...
we had our problems.

06:19.010 --> 06:20.568
But...

06:20.610 --> 06:24.444
he gave me a-a
great settlement.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.972
He bankrupted himself just-just
to give Stevie everything.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.715
I mean, he was even
scraping together

06:29.750 --> 06:31.411
to send him...

06:31.450 --> 06:33.156
to send him to a
private preschool.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.715
He sounds like
a good man, Debbie,

06:35.760 --> 06:37.887
which is why I'm confused.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.818
See, we found a brick of C-4

06:39.860 --> 06:42.966
explosive in your
ex-husband's apartment.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.865
And now I'm wondering...

06:44.900 --> 06:47.494
Maybe all the financial burden,
maybe he got into debt,

06:47.540 --> 06:49.030
owed the wrong people.
No.

06:49.070 --> 06:52.699
He hated anything
hanging over his head.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.833
Why would he bring
explosives home?

06:54.880 --> 06:57.576
I don't know.

06:57.610 --> 06:58.975
But I'm gonna find out.

07:09.960 --> 07:13.054
Agent Charles Sewell,
Lieutenant Burns.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.056
This is my partner,
Detective Wells.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.658
Detective Wells,

07:16.700 --> 07:19.066
nice to meet you.
Carrie. Likewise.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.194
May 19, 2012.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.199
May 19, 2012
was a Saturday.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.071
Temperature
was a high of 75

07:28.110 --> 07:29.839
in Manhattan.
Al and I had just closed

07:29.880 --> 07:30.847
the Jennings serial killer case.

07:30.880 --> 07:31.972
We went out

07:32.010 --> 07:33.216
to lunch celebrate.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.673
Al had a rib eye,
medium rare.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.608
It was the first day
I read about you two

07:37.650 --> 07:38.685
in the New York papers.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.551
Okay, what do you got for us?

07:40.590 --> 07:41.955
Well, Coasties stick together,

07:41.990 --> 07:43.685
so no one would
talk about Callahan.

07:43.730 --> 07:44.958
But I did find
a gunnery officer that

07:44.990 --> 07:46.548
got a little chatty

07:46.600 --> 07:47.953
when I threatened him
with a court-martial.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.558
Follow me.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.818
You know, my favorite
uncle was a Coastie.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.134
Bought a 21-foot Liberator
when he retired.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.831
Twin Mercs,
Two-Sixties.

07:55.870 --> 07:58.259
Nice. Must've turn_ed
like she was on rails.

07:58.310 --> 08:00.699
Those are beauties.
You like boats?

08:00.740 --> 08:03.538
That depends on who's
operating them.

08:03.580 --> 08:06.743
So, Callahan's
security clearance

08:06.780 --> 08:09.078
granted him access
to this area right here.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.816
At ease. This is
Senior Chief Holliman.

08:11.850 --> 08:13.613
Tell 'em
what you reported.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.810
Gunner's Mate Callahan
signed out the C-4.

08:15.860 --> 08:17.225
But he didn't
have authorization,

08:17.260 --> 08:19.251
but he works for me,

08:19.290 --> 08:22.088
I know him...
Save the excuses for a JAG
at your disciplinary hearing.

08:22.130 --> 08:25.622
I'm sorry, Agent Sewell, he said
it was for a training exercise.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.228
But there wasn't one, was there?

08:28.740 --> 08:30.731
Dismissed,
Senior Chief Holliman.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.669
Coast Guard _
Investigative Serwces

08:34.710 --> 08:37.201
will make sure_this
never happens again, but...

08:37.250 --> 08:38.706
I got to say, this is surprising

08:38.750 --> 08:40.115
from a straight arrow
like Callahan.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.640
No blots on his
serwce record?

08:41.680 --> 08:42.783
Spotless.
He never did this

08:42.820 --> 08:44.549
before, as far
as we can tell.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.751
Just checked out these
two bricks of C-4.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.008
Two bricks?

08:49.060 --> 08:52.257
We only recovered
one brick at the scene.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.793
Which mean Callahan's killer
could have the other one.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.861
It's a small amount, but

08:57.900 --> 09:00.596
properly placed, it could
take down a building.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.638
Callahan's killer could be
running around with that

09:06.680 --> 09:08.272
second brick of C-4,
but Homeland Security's

09:08.310 --> 09:09.334
not picking up any

09:09.380 --> 09:11.905
terrorist chatter.
In any event,

09:11.950 --> 09:15.613
I got my old FBI office mate
scouring the unfiltered intel.

09:15.650 --> 09:16.947
Nice contact.
Mm.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.140
I set her up with her husband.

09:19.190 --> 09:20.782
Listen, there's
no prints of value

09:20.820 --> 09:22.356
in Callahan's apartment.
There's no angry

09:22.390 --> 09:24.654
girlfriend,
no conflicts that we

09:24.690 --> 09:27.352
know of.
Okay, so I'm Callahan.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.324
Great guy, no scrapes,
clean_ record.
Right.

09:30.370 --> 09:33.191
Why am I checking out C-4
and lying about it?

09:34.800 --> 09:36.768
Remember a couple
years ago--

09:36.810 --> 09:38.801
those ATF guys--
they pinched C-4

09:38.840 --> 09:40.330
to clear trees to build

09:40.380 --> 09:43.042
pools and patios
in their backyards?

09:43.080 --> 09:46.208
Well, if we're lucky, Callahan
just wanted to go for a swim.

09:46.250 --> 09:49.947
Jay, what'd you find
on Callahan's finances?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.309
Well, most of his

09:51.350 --> 09:52.851
paycheck went straight
to child support.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.312
But check this.
He deposited

09:54.360 --> 09:56.726
$4,200 in cash
a few days ago and then

09:56.760 --> 09:58.819
turned right around and paid
off his kid's preschool tuition.

09:58.860 --> 10:00.851
Well, he could've sold
the C-4 for a quick buck

10:00.900 --> 10:02.925
and the deal went south.
Here's
what I got

10:02.970 --> 10:04.699
on his credit cards.
Last transaction

10:04.730 --> 10:07.699
was at Metro West
Parking Garage in Chelsea

10:07.740 --> 10:09.230
at 9:48 pm. on Monday.

10:09.270 --> 10:11.704
I have been to some amazing

10:11.740 --> 10:13.037
five-_star restaurants
in that area.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.006
What?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.701
Men take me OUt sometimes.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.718
Hey.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.149
Zoom in there

10:21.180 --> 10:22.886
for a sec, Jay.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.817
CARRIE:
Stevie didn't see anything?

10:26.860 --> 10:29.351
HEATHER:
Me either.

10:29.390 --> 10:31.881
That cocktail
napkin...

10:31.930 --> 10:33.352
Callahan was at
Lantini's restaurant.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.220
MURRAY:
Lantini's?

10:35.260 --> 10:37.763
Marco and Giuliana Lantini
are Steel Chefs.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.222
What was
Callahan doing

10:39.270 --> 10:40.828
at a restaurant with
a year

10:40.870 --> 10:43.202
He doesn't strike me
as the $20 martini type.

10:52.310 --> 10:55.370
50 bucks for
mushroom pasta?

10:55.420 --> 10:57.149
They're not "mushrooms,"
they're "truffles."

10:57.190 --> 10:58.839
And come on, Al.

10:58.890 --> 11:00.380
You've never been happy
unless you grill it

11:00.420 --> 11:01.751
and slap it
on a bun.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.280
I like the
sound of that.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.729
Yeah, I'll
bet you do.

11:07.330 --> 11:09.025
Hi.

11:09.060 --> 11:10.721
May I have the name
on your reservation?

11:12.030 --> 11:13.463
Hey, I have an audition

11:13.500 --> 11:14.865
to be one of you guys.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.094
Do you do ride

11:17.340 --> 11:18.432
You seen this man?

11:18.470 --> 11:19.937
Oh, no.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.130
Is he pressing charges?

11:22.180 --> 11:23.738
Charges?
For what?

11:23.780 --> 11:26.908
Look, could you just
leave me out of this?

11:26.950 --> 11:28.372
Acting's hard,

11:28.420 --> 11:30.718
but getting a job in a place
like this is impossible.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.809
How about we take you
on that ride-along...

11:32.860 --> 11:34.054
in handcuffs?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.158
Okay, okay.

11:37.190 --> 11:39.055
That guy was at the bar
two nights ago.

11:39.090 --> 11:41.991
I turned away for a second
and he barged into the kitchen.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.964
Next thing I know,
Chef Marco had a fit

11:44.000 --> 11:44.967
and threw him out.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.228
We'd like
to ask

11:46.270 --> 11:48.033
Mr. Lantini a few questions.

11:48.070 --> 11:49.935
Sorry, he's not here.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.938
How about Mrs. Lantini?

11:51.970 --> 11:53.176
Was she working that night?

11:53.210 --> 11:54.802
No. No, no, no, no.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.000
And she's at a book signing

11:56.040 --> 11:57.507
in Connecticut
today.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.108
So I really can't help you.

11:59.150 --> 12:00.515
You sure?

12:00.550 --> 12:02.472
'Cause that sounds like
obstruction to me.

12:06.920 --> 12:08.785
Okay.

12:08.820 --> 12:12.051
Marco just left for a party
at Chelsea Piers.

12:12.090 --> 12:13.819
It was pier number, um...

12:21.070 --> 12:22.037
Here it is.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.038
Pier 60.

12:24.070 --> 12:26.209
And me without
my party dress.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.400
Let's go,
Cinderella.

12:32.410 --> 12:33.968
All right.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.214
Jay says
there's nothing

12:35.250 --> 12:36.945
that ties Callahan
to Lantini.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.844
No phone records,
e-mails, nothing.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.517
So what's_ their
connection?

12:40.560 --> 12:42.755
And I don't see
any event out here.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.258
We just missed it.

12:47.860 --> 12:49.794
What are you doing?

12:49.830 --> 12:51.388
STEVIE:
I coloring.

12:51.430 --> 12:53.261
CARRIE:
You coloring?

12:53.300 --> 12:54.995
SEWELL:
Just checked out these
two bricks of C-4.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.406
CARRIE:
We only recovered one
from the scene.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.532
Al, call Harbor.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.878
Have them turn

12:59.910 --> 13:01.138
that boat
around. Now!

13:08.620 --> 13:10.417
AL:
Lieutenant Al Burns.
Be advised,

13:10.450 --> 13:12.589
we got a charter boat explosion
at Chelsea Piers.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.315
Notify Harbor,
Coast Guard, FDNY.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.418
MAN:
Nick, get away
from the railing!

13:15.460 --> 13:16.882
Send buses!

13:16.930 --> 13:18.124
We got people in
the water out here.

13:36.140 --> 13:39.109
We're good.
All right.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.111
Get that small boat in there
as close as you can.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.243
I want every
piece of evidence.
Bag it and tag it.

13:45.290 --> 13:47.986
I don't care if
it's floating trash.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.420
You're lucky
you work on land.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.348
I got evidence
already going under.

13:52.390 --> 13:54.096
See, your problem is you've got

13:54.130 --> 13:55.495
most of your divers
over there at eight o'clock,

13:55.530 --> 13:57.168
by that floating deck chair,

13:57.200 --> 13:58.599
and most of your evidence

13:58.630 --> 14:00.495
is here, at 11 o'clock.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.235
Half of which

14:02.270 --> 14:03.999
went under when rescue boats
churned up wakes

14:04.040 --> 14:05.234
getting survivors
out of the water.

14:05.270 --> 14:07.977
Better than advertised.

14:08.010 --> 14:09.136
Oh.

14:09.180 --> 14:10.977
All right, guys.

14:11.010 --> 14:12.375
Move it starboard 100 yards.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.116
MAN :
100 yards. Roger that.

14:14.150 --> 14:15.845
We have a visual.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.480
What'd you
ﬁnd,Jay?

14:26.530 --> 14:28.327
Okay, Al, we got
an 85-foot party charter:

14:28.360 --> 14:30.191
eight crew, ten guests.
All chefs.

14:30.230 --> 14:32.266
They were celebrating
a joint restaurant venture,

14:32.300 --> 14:34.268
uh, "Gourmet
Food Bazaar."

14:34.300 --> 14:36.336
Cooking some feast
for each other.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.201
You had Paula Sherwood,
Lonnie Hamilton,

14:38.240 --> 14:40.231
Pablo Vaye...
Big-name chefs,

14:40.280 --> 14:41.429
you get the idea.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.970
All right. Thanks, guys.

14:43.010 --> 14:44.546
So, a few
injuries

14:44.580 --> 14:46.343
and amazingly only one fatality.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.938
Ataru Yamato.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.117
What about Marco Lantini?

14:49.150 --> 14:50.549
One of the survivors.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.683
Picked up by a fire boat,
taken to the paramedics.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.688
All right,
Callahan steals C-4,

14:54.720 --> 14:56.483
gets into a throwdown
with Lantini

14:56.520 --> 14:58.283
and now this yacht blows up.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.924
Callahan's dead, so how
does he blow up the yacht?

15:00.960 --> 15:02.496
A timer?

15:02.530 --> 15:04.498
There's too many variables.
There's no guarantee

15:04.530 --> 15:05.497
when the boat
would get underway

15:05.530 --> 15:07.339
or whether the target
would even be on board.

15:07.370 --> 15:09.292
It's got to be
something more

15:09.340 --> 15:12.036
like a triggered detonator.

15:12.070 --> 15:13.935
So maybe an accomplice
tripped the C-4

15:13.980 --> 15:16.699
after he killed Callahan?

15:16.740 --> 15:19.049
There's a big chunk of the
stern going under there.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.638
Damn it.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.478
T_hese flood currents are
sweeping away our eVIdence, huh?

15:23.520 --> 15:25.340
What's a leg like you know
about flood currents?

15:25.390 --> 15:27.711
I used to go fishing
on Lake Ontario.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.955
Yeah? I did
my ice rescues up there.
Yeah.

15:29.990 --> 15:31.582
That's some serious ice.
That's some
serious ice.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.450
Yeah.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.627
There goes the rest of it.
I got to let it go.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.093
It's too dangerous.

15:37.130 --> 15:38.688
Pull the divers.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.994
Copy that. Pulling divers.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.235
That evidence just went
down the drain.

15:43.270 --> 15:46.979
And our only link to that
O4 is Marco Lantini.

15:47.010 --> 15:49.376
JAY:
This Lantini guy's back at work
a few hours

15:49.410 --> 15:50.741
after they fish him out
of the Hudson.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.645
A little weird, right?
Yeah,

15:52.680 --> 15:53.977
that's really weird.
The Lantinis

15:54.020 --> 15:55.647
have a restaurant in Vegas,

15:55.680 --> 15:57.238
villa on the Riviera,

15:57.290 --> 15:59.440
Bermuda estate, so forth,
so on and so on.

15:59.490 --> 16:01.151
We are in the
wrong business, buddy.

16:01.190 --> 16:03.556
We need to learn how to cook.

16:03.590 --> 16:06.388
Before Marco Lantini
hit it big, guess what--

16:06.430 --> 16:08.125
he spent his entire youth
in and out

16:08.160 --> 16:09.718
of Spofford Juvenile
Detention Center.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.092
In Hunts Point?
Yeah.

16:12.130 --> 16:14.030
You know Callahan grew up a few

16:14.070 --> 16:15.662
neighborhoods
away from there?

16:15.700 --> 16:18.533
Lantini and Callahan,
they could go way back.

16:18.570 --> 16:20.208
Maybe to hanging out
on the stoop,

16:20.240 --> 16:21.639
knocking back
a few cold ones.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.648
Lantini hires his old pal
to do some dirty work

16:23.680 --> 16:25.147
with the C-4.
Carrie and Al

16:25.180 --> 16:26.340
should hear this.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.048
AL:
Thanks, Murray.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.216
MAN: Let's go. Come on.
WOMAN: Wait.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.717
MAN 2: All right, everybody.
We're rolling.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.716
Quiet on the set.
Take one.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.456
And... action.

16:38.490 --> 16:40.355
I really can't express

16:40.400 --> 16:42.425
how sad we are over
the loss of our

16:42.460 --> 16:45.122
dear friend, Ataru Yamato.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.161
We dedicate this episode to him.

16:47.200 --> 16:51.569
By cooking a dish he always
enjoyed here at the restaurant.

16:51.610 --> 16:54.374
* I'm comin' up

16:54.410 --> 16:58.073
* So you better get
this party started *

16:58.110 --> 17:00.146
* I'm...

17:00.180 --> 17:02.671
He doesn't look shaken up
by the explosion.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.644
Or by Yamato's death.
GIULIANA:
This...

17:05.690 --> 17:08.579
was the first song
that we ever danced to.

17:08.620 --> 17:10.588
And...

17:10.630 --> 17:11.722
Mmm.
Ooh.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.398
I fell in love
with him right away.

17:13.430 --> 17:15.728
She fell in love
with my ossobuco.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.068
Brother.

17:17.100 --> 17:17.828
DIRECTOR:
And...

17:17.870 --> 17:18.689
cut.

17:23.240 --> 17:24.798
Hey, Detectives.
I got all your messages.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.832
Uh, I want to help you
any way I can.
Wow.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.201
You just...
You bounced back real fast.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.810
Bit of a workaholic,
according to my wife.

17:32.850 --> 17:34.579
I'm also pretty damn luclq.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.315
I'm from
Salerno.

17:36.350 --> 17:38.443
We're kind of stubborn.
Testa dura.

17:38.490 --> 17:40.481
You ever seen this man?

17:40.520 --> 17:42.408
That guy. Yeah, yeah.
I tossed him out

17:42.460 --> 17:44.155
of my kitchen just a
couple of days ago.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.623
You know, these people,
they see you on TV,

17:45.660 --> 17:47.355
they stroll in
off the street,

17:47.400 --> 17:48.753
they treat you
like they're family.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.859
Hey, Giules. Come here.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.720
You ever see

17:52.770 --> 17:55.091
this guy before?
Um... no,

17:55.140 --> 17:56.698
I'm sorry.
I haven_'t._
Mr. Lantini,

17:56.740 --> 17:59.106
we believe the explosion
was intentional,

17:59.140 --> 18:02.530
a bomb.
And this man was involved.
A bomb?

18:02.580 --> 18:05.549
You're kidding. I-I thought
a gas line blew or something.

18:05.580 --> 18:06.774
CARRIE:
Can you think

18:06.810 --> 18:08.175
of any reason why...

18:08.220 --> 18:09.778
someone might want
to blow you up?

18:09.820 --> 18:12.118
No. I mean, I'm a chef.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.287
You know, you work
in enough kitchens,

18:13.320 --> 18:14.787
you piss enough
people off,

18:14.820 --> 18:17.254
but, uh, no, blow up a boat? No.

18:17.290 --> 18:19.520
You sure? Maybe somebody
from the old days?

18:19.560 --> 18:22.256
My husband's past
is behind him.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.528
How far?

18:23.570 --> 18:24.798
AL:
The "tourist"
you tossed out

18:24.830 --> 18:26.388
specialized
in explosives.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.330
We don't think
he was working alone.

18:28.370 --> 18:30.804
And he was murdered a day
before the bombing.

18:30.840 --> 18:32.660
That guy is dead?

18:32.710 --> 18:34.405
Where were you
Tuesday afternoon?

18:34.440 --> 18:36.533
Are you kidding me?
You think I did it?

18:36.580 --> 18:37.808
Damn it. Hey,

18:37.850 --> 18:39.306
I was a victim on that boat,

18:39.350 --> 18:40.669
okay?
Marco.
Marco.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.712
Detectives, it's impossible.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.547
We were at our
home food diViSion.

18:45.590 --> 18:47.455
20 sales reps
can confirm it.

18:47.490 --> 18:49.583
_ Callahan came
into your restaurant,

18:49.620 --> 18:51.588
the boat
you were on blew up,

18:51.630 --> 18:53.757
_Yamato
is dead,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.826
and, help me out here, Marco,
you're the common denominator.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.397
I told you everything I know,
okay?

18:59.430 --> 19:02.331
Except Yamato was my friend.

19:02.370 --> 19:03.803
DIRECTOR:
Next segment's up.
Beer-battered shrimp.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.764
It could've just as easily
been me who was killed.

19:06.810 --> 19:09.904
Yeah.
We'll be in touch.

19:13.950 --> 19:15.918
So, the Lantinis' sales reps
said the couple was hawking

19:15.950 --> 19:18.510
their frozen ravioli
when Callahan was murdered.

19:18.550 --> 19:19.915
So their alibi checks out.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.555
Any bad blood
between him and Yamato?

19:22.590 --> 19:25.229
Money problems?
Mmm...

19:25.260 --> 19:27.694
Hard to tell. Yamato's got shell
companies within shell companies

19:27.730 --> 19:29.948
and investors
from here to Tokyo.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.422
Guy sold a lot of raw fish.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.597
Hey, so I checked
into insurance fraud.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.198
Nothing.
And so far

19:35.240 --> 19:36.593
I can't find a thing
that points to the crew

19:36.640 --> 19:38.369
or other chefs as targets.

19:38.410 --> 19:40.275
Really? Not even that, uh,
Pablo what's

19:40.310 --> 19:41.277
That annoying barbecue guy?

19:41.310 --> 19:43.346
Pablo Vaye. Mmm. Handsome

19:43.380 --> 19:45.405
and he knows his way
around a brisket. And, no,

19:45.450 --> 19:48.271
there's nothing
pointing to him.
So, besides Lantini,

19:48.320 --> 19:50.481
any links between
Callahan and the rest of
the people on the boat?

19:50.520 --> 19:52.738
Not even a thin thread.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.280
But if we had any doubts

19:54.320 --> 19:56.584
Callahan was tied
to that bombing,

19:56.620 --> 19:59.453
they're gone.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.253
That the kid's picture?
Mm-hmm.
We uploaded it

20:01.300 --> 20:02.449
to the server. Jay?

20:03.600 --> 20:05.591
And now here's how it looked
on the light box.

20:05.630 --> 20:08.565
Carrie was right.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.569
Callahan had the boat schematic.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.635
We find out where
he planted the bomb,

20:13.680 --> 20:16.831
maybe we find
our target.

20:19.580 --> 20:22.572
So, we haul in the wreckage
and then reconstruct the boat.

20:22.620 --> 20:24.315
Hell of

20:24.350 --> 20:25.647
a jigsaw puzzle.

20:25.690 --> 20:27.954
CARRIE:
I always loved
doing jigsaw puzzles

20:27.990 --> 20:30.458
face down.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.549
She memorizes the pieces.
It's scary.

20:32.590 --> 20:34.421
I was going to
say "amazing."

20:34.460 --> 20:37.566
He was gonna say "amazing."

20:37.600 --> 20:39.625
So, the reconstruction
can tell us more

20:39.670 --> 20:41.592
about the bomb and
hopefully our bomber.

20:41.640 --> 20:42.789
Jo.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.330
WEBSTER:
I just sent you a photo

20:44.370 --> 20:46.702
of something I pulled
from Chef Yamato's body.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.674
CARRIE:
Oh.

20:48.710 --> 20:49.904
That's a bolt.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.601
You want to
see it first?

20:51.650 --> 20:54.414
No, I'm good,
but that bolt's trajectory

20:54.450 --> 20:57.510
should help us pinpoint the
bomb's location and force.

20:57.550 --> 20:58.642
Exactly...

20:58.690 --> 21:00.555
to the man with the sew voice.

21:00.590 --> 21:03.650
The bolt penetrated
the gluteus medius, but

21:03.690 --> 21:06.557
the sad irony is,
it landed in his stomach.

21:06.590 --> 21:09.297
All right,
thanks, Jo.

21:09.330 --> 21:11.298
You know, I've seen
that bolt before

21:11.330 --> 21:13.662
right...

21:13.700 --> 21:16.430
here.

21:16.470 --> 21:19.439
She wasn't kidding
about the jigsaw puzzles.

21:19.470 --> 21:21.700
That's the engine cover.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.844
The bolt came from below.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.347
Which would mean the source

21:25.380 --> 21:26.699
of the explosion
was the engine room.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.342
'Cause if the
bomb exploded

21:28.380 --> 21:30.018
anywhere else aboard,
the bolt would have melted

21:30.050 --> 21:31.711
in the slow-burning fire.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.559
But that bolt was blown
clean off and stripped.

21:33.590 --> 21:35.854
The bomber hid the explosives
under the engine cover.

21:35.890 --> 21:37.721
I've seen the schematics.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.853
Yamato was cooking in
the galley, directly above it.

21:39.890 --> 21:42.324
So, he could have
been the target.

21:42.360 --> 21:45.989
Whoever did this knew boats,
tried to make it look like

21:46.030 --> 21:48.498
an accidental engine fire.
AL:
Callahan knew boats,

21:48.540 --> 21:50.098
but he was dead
before the yacht exploded.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.903
Doesn't mean Lantini
didn't hire him

21:51.940 --> 21:54.374
to get the C-4 and
build the bomb, but

21:54.410 --> 21:56.878
why would our chef board a
boat he knew would explode?

21:56.910 --> 21:58.446
Doesn't add up.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.914
It does if Callahan told him
where to stay safe.

22:03.450 --> 22:06.089
of C-4 was used.
It is a perfect alibi.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.554
We'll test the engine
cover for RDX residue.

22:08.590 --> 22:11.582
Chromatography can confirm
it was C-4 that was used.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.019
I'll let you
know what I get.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.464
I like the cut of his jib.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.798
You're just saying
random words now.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.532
Jay, what'd you find on Yamato?

22:25.570 --> 22:27.674
Macheted through his finances.

22:27.710 --> 22:29.371
Turns out Yamato was in the hole

22:29.410 --> 22:30.775
to the tune of $4 million

22:30.810 --> 22:33.040
to his main investor,
Oguri Holdings.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.116
I know those guys.

22:35.150 --> 22:38.449
They were indicted
on RICO charges in the '905.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.412
It's a front for the Yakuza.

22:40.460 --> 22:44.385
Yakuza? Man, I didn't know
the sushi business was so rough.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.159
Maybe rough enough
for Yamato to get blown up

22:46.190 --> 22:47.794
for not paying back his debts.

22:50.570 --> 22:52.629
Detective Carrie Wells,
Mr. Shiomi.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.397
CFO, Oguri Holdings.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.658
I'm here to help,
Detectives, but if this is

22:58.710 --> 23:00.803
about the boat explosion,
you're wasting your time.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.876
I can assure you
my firm has been

23:02.910 --> 23:05.140
a fully legitimate operation
for ten years.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.910
Chef Yamato's passing
brings me nothing but sadness.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.542
AL:
Yeah.

23:09.580 --> 23:11.184
It's tragic to lose
four million bucks.

23:11.220 --> 23:14.656
We lent Yamato capital,
but he was about to pay us back.

23:14.690 --> 23:15.952
Not according to his books.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.958
What was the money for?

23:17.990 --> 23:21.949
I apologize, but our investors
require confidentiality.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.490
AL:
You won't have time

23:23.530 --> 23:24.827
for your investors

23:24.870 --> 23:26.565
with our forensic
accountants poring over

23:26.600 --> 23:28.966
your fully legitimate operation.

23:30.740 --> 23:33.038
It wasn't announced yet.

23:33.070 --> 23:34.935
Chef Yamato just
won a bid to open

23:34.980 --> 23:37.540
his restaurant at the
new Triumph Tower.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.617
It was very competitive.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.115
HOST:
It was pier number...

23:50.220 --> 23:52.586
We're done here.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.996
Thank you for your time.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.765
What was that about?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.461
He's telling the truth.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.468
The bid was competitive.

24:04.510 --> 24:05.761
I think the Lantinis
are the next bidders in line

24:07.240 --> 24:09.037
I saw the security badges

24:09.080 --> 24:11.640
for that building
at their restaurant.

24:11.680 --> 24:15.047
So, maybe Marco Lantini knocked
Yamato off the top of the pile?

24:18.920 --> 24:20.888
Great. Got it.

24:20.920 --> 24:23.218
Eliot's friend at Leasing
and Permits came through.

24:23.260 --> 24:24.750
Carrie was right.

24:24.790 --> 24:26.758
Marco and Giuliana Lantini
are next in line

24:26.790 --> 24:28.052
for the Triumph Tower.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.762
Hey, great to see you.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.165
We're here to see
Marco Lantini.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.191
Oh. Missed him again.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.889
If this is you acting, I can see

24:35.940 --> 24:37.532
why you're still working
in a restaurant.

24:37.570 --> 24:39.060
Okay, okay.

24:39.110 --> 24:41.908
When Marco works late
or has a fight with Giuliana,

24:41.940 --> 24:44.079
he sleeps upstairs.
Upstairs, where?

24:44.110 --> 24:47.147
He's got a pied--terre on the
second floor right over there.

24:57.690 --> 25:00.124
Mr. Lantini?

25:08.570 --> 25:10.868
It's clear.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.876
So, we got two
chefs murdered.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.842
Could this whole thing be about
the Triumph Tower contract?

25:24.890 --> 25:26.539
The third chef in line

25:26.590 --> 25:28.649
could have wanted Yamato
and Lantini out of the way.

25:28.690 --> 25:31.682
Oh, that would be Pablo Vaye,
that annoying barbecue guy.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.254
I'll get on it.

25:33.290 --> 25:35.656
Yeah. Jo.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.861
Hello. Well,

25:37.900 --> 25:40.118
Chef Lantini was a powerful man.

25:40.170 --> 25:43.560
The assailant had to penetrate
Marco's substantial

25:43.610 --> 25:45.566
intercostals.

25:45.610 --> 25:47.669
Six-pack.

25:47.710 --> 25:49.871
Chef killed
by his own kitchen knife.

25:49.910 --> 25:53.243
Missing from that block
right over there.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.339
So, there's no sign
of forced entry.

25:55.380 --> 25:56.779
Maybe Marco and Giuliana

25:56.820 --> 25:58.082
get into a fight, she goes

25:58.120 --> 25:59.815
psycho on him.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.351
Do we really like
her for this?

26:01.390 --> 26:03.358
Marco outweighed Giuliana
by a hundred pounds, easy.

26:03.390 --> 26:05.654
It would be
virtually impossible for

26:05.690 --> 26:07.794
any woman to take down this guy,

26:07.830 --> 26:09.195
in my professional opinion.

26:09.230 --> 26:11.221
The assailant plunged

26:11.270 --> 26:13.693
the knife into the diaphragm,
yanked it up,

26:13.740 --> 26:15.696
and punctured the left ventricle
of the heart

26:15.740 --> 26:17.093
to cause maximum damage.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.108
I think I remember that move.

26:19.140 --> 26:20.869
Right? That, uh,

26:20.910 --> 26:22.673
stalker case up in
Ditmas Park, right?

26:22.710 --> 26:24.871
The killer in that one had
military training. Same might be

26:24.910 --> 26:26.241
true here.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.713
Good luck.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.274
I don't know.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.844
Giuliana's got "motive"
stamped all over her.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.687
She could have hired a hit man.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.711
She gets rid of her husband,

26:34.760 --> 26:36.159
s_cores her _
the entire food empire,

26:36.190 --> 26:38.624
right? Plus,
she also inherits

26:38.660 --> 26:40.389
the Triumph Tower space
ahead of Pablo Vaye.

26:40.430 --> 26:44.696
Let's say Giuliana contracted
Callahan to blow up the boat.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.869
And let's say
the deal went bad.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.697
Maybe Callahan showed up
at the restaurant,

26:48.740 --> 26:49.991
tried to extort more money

26:50.040 --> 26:51.701
from her.
That'd make her sweat.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.139
Maybe she hires

26:53.170 --> 26:54.637
one of Marco's old pals
to bump off Callahan

26:54.680 --> 26:55.999
and go through
with the bombing.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.974
Maybe Giuliana's hit man

26:58.010 --> 27:00.843
blew up the wrong chef
and came here to finish the job.

27:07.220 --> 27:09.654
I can't even get
out of the building

27:09.690 --> 27:13.319
to make funeral arrangements
with the paparazzi out there.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.419
I'm sorry, Detectives.
Would you like some tea?

27:15.460 --> 27:16.927
We're good.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.827
We know this
is a tough day.

27:19.870 --> 27:21.758
Please,

27:21.800 --> 27:24.360
find who did this.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.059
Doing everything
we can, all hands.

27:26.110 --> 27:27.407
That includes having

27:27.440 --> 27:29.032
to ask you some hard questions,
Mrs. Lantini.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.900
You and your husband
were having problems.

27:30.950 --> 27:34.147
Can you tell us what was
going on

27:37.050 --> 27:40.087
We work in a high-pressure
environment.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.815
We're passionate.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.782
So, our marriage could be
a roller coaster.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.183
Were we saints?

27:45.230 --> 27:48.688
No, but... we were best friends.

27:48.730 --> 27:51.062
We wanted things to work.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.933
We were, um...

27:53.970 --> 27:55.995
We were going to Rome.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.031
I was hoping that it would...

27:58.070 --> 28:01.278
I'm sorry, Detectives.
Do we have to do this now?

28:01.310 --> 28:03.471
Mrs. Lantini,
we can't ignore the fact

28:03.510 --> 28:05.808
that you're about
to inherit a fortune.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.045
You don't think
that I killed my husband?

28:08.080 --> 28:10.275
We know you have
nothing to hide.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.811
I'm sorry. I was nowhere near
the restaurant last night.

28:12.850 --> 28:14.886
I was here working
with my assistant.

28:14.920 --> 28:17.821
We have a security camera
if you'd like to check it.

28:17.860 --> 28:19.953
MURRAY:
I'm sorry, but there's also

28:19.990 --> 28:22.322
a $5 million
life insurance policy?

28:23.800 --> 28:25.461
That's nothing.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.037
If I have to be crass,

28:28.070 --> 28:31.506
my husband was worth
far more alive than dead.

28:31.540 --> 28:34.304
We were a brand.

28:34.340 --> 28:38.242
The Lantinis,
the happy cooking couple.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.373
We needed each other.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.219
In our line of work,

28:42.250 --> 28:44.241
we see people's needs
get pretty twisted.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.383
My life--

28:46.420 --> 28:48.479
what is it without Marco?

28:48.520 --> 28:50.920
Now,

28:50.960 --> 28:53.087
unless you're going
to arrest me,

28:53.130 --> 28:55.928
I'll be upstairs, and
my assistant will show you out.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.791
She's not telling us
everything.
No.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.138
I want you and Jay
digging into her.

29:05.570 --> 29:08.004
Murray.
This way, please.

29:08.040 --> 29:09.871
Yeah, okay. Got it.

29:09.910 --> 29:11.798
Coast Guard's pulled
up more debris,

29:11.850 --> 29:15.149
and Carrie said she'll
meet you at the warehouse.

29:15.180 --> 29:17.410
SEWELL:
Check this out.

29:17.450 --> 29:20.146
I may know how
he got the bomb on board.

29:20.190 --> 29:21.919
Okay, what do you guys see?

29:21.960 --> 29:23.882
Blast pattern
of shrapnel. Metal.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.557
This is the top

29:25.590 --> 29:27.148
of the engine room ceiling.

29:27.190 --> 29:29.021
CARRIE:
There are shards
of metal embedded in it.

29:29.060 --> 29:32.029
Looks like the bomber hid
the explosives in some kind of

29:32.070 --> 29:33.367
metal case.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.890
Good thinking, Carrie.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.191
Oh. Thanks, Chuck.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.105
Chuck?

29:38.140 --> 29:41.029
So, someone working
with Giuliana Lantini

29:41.080 --> 29:43.298
could have hidden the explosives
in a catering cart?

29:43.340 --> 29:45.444
Hmm, those are heavy metal.
This looks like

29:45.480 --> 29:48.210
aluminum, tin, something cheap.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.514
Well, we got bread crumbs
going in every direction.

29:50.550 --> 29:52.586
We got to follow them all.

29:52.620 --> 29:54.759
Nice job... Chuck.

29:58.630 --> 30:00.188
JAY:
I've been talking

30:00.230 --> 30:01.925
to people all day who make food.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.928
I haven't had a second
for lunch. I'm starving.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.961
I'll get your favorite
tuna sandwich from the machine.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.490
What do you have
on the Triumph Tower?

30:07.530 --> 30:09.361
Well, the third chef
in line for the space

30:09.400 --> 30:10.936
just withdrew
his bid today.

30:10.970 --> 30:13.063
He didn't want
all the bad P.R.

30:13.110 --> 30:15.931
Doesn't look like your annoying
barbecue guy's our killer, huh?
No.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.277
And we're still interviewing
everybody from the building

30:17.310 --> 30:18.948
that night-- residents, diners.

30:18.980 --> 30:20.845
But it's looking
like business as usual there.

30:20.880 --> 30:23.348
Hey, guys. Check this out.
The Coast Guard just dug up

30:23.380 --> 30:25.086
the menu cards
from the yacht party.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.850
The meal
had timed courses.

30:27.890 --> 30:30.950
Yamato wasn't supposed to be
cooking when the bomb went off.

30:30.990 --> 30:32.855
That was Lantini's slot.

30:32.890 --> 30:36.223
The two chefs switched courses.

30:36.260 --> 30:38.228
So Lantini
was definitely the target.

30:38.270 --> 30:40.124
Have Eliot pull strings.

30:40.170 --> 30:41.398
We need a warrant.
Okay.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.863
Giuliana Lantini?

30:43.910 --> 30:45.901
Police!

30:52.350 --> 30:54.045
Clear.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.139
Bedrooms.

31:09.930 --> 31:11.898
Bedrooms are clear.

31:12.930 --> 31:14.932
You hear that?
Yeah.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.408
We just
missed her.

31:24.450 --> 31:25.576
She's gone.

31:35.390 --> 31:38.052
Hey, Carrie, Al. I got
the security footage

31:38.090 --> 31:40.024
from Giuliana Lantini's
building.

31:40.060 --> 31:41.357
Take a look.

31:45.300 --> 31:46.562
Freeze it.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.993
I just want you to know,
I-I want

31:50.040 --> 31:52.304
to help you
any way I can.

31:52.340 --> 31:53.659
His shoes.

31:53.710 --> 31:55.268
Bit of a workaholic,
according to my wife.

31:55.310 --> 31:57.972
I'm also
pretty damn luclq.

31:58.010 --> 31:59.978
He's a chef
at the Lantinis' restaurant.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.546
I saw him arguing
with Giuliana.

32:01.580 --> 32:02.717
Maybe they were having
an affair?

32:02.750 --> 32:04.308
You thinking a lovers' quarrel?

32:04.350 --> 32:06.181
She did seem like
she was hiding something.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.279
Let it roll.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.257
Lieutenant Al Burns.
Be advised,

32:17.300 --> 32:19.427
we got a charter boat explosion
at Chelsea Piers.

32:19.470 --> 32:22.394
Notify Harbor,
Coast Guard, FDNY.

32:27.340 --> 32:28.102
Send buses!

32:28.140 --> 32:30.028
We got people
in the water out here.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.308
MAN:
Nick, get away
from the railing!

32:32.350 --> 32:35.046
Are they okay?

32:38.350 --> 32:40.011
CARRIE:
He was there.

32:40.050 --> 32:42.189
That backpack.
I saw the same backpack

32:42.220 --> 32:43.357
at the pier

32:43.390 --> 32:44.550
the day the
yacht exploded.

32:44.590 --> 32:45.386
He put his cell phone into it.

32:45.430 --> 32:47.751
The remote trigger;
he's our bomber.

32:47.790 --> 32:49.223
JAY:
Let me check
Lantini's employees.

32:50.330 --> 32:52.321
CARRIE:
That's him.

32:53.770 --> 32:55.988
JAY:
Full name's Robert Singh.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.530
Sous chef at Lantini's.

32:57.570 --> 32:59.037
Married, no kids.

32:59.070 --> 33:00.230
Served in the Coast Guard,

33:00.270 --> 33:01.339
dishonorable discharge
for psych.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.506
CARRIE:
Coast Guard,

33:02.540 --> 33:03.734
that's how
he knows Callahan.
All right,

33:03.780 --> 33:05.247
they're on the run.
Put it over the air.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.498
Check airports,
train stations, tolls.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.211
Text us his address
and send a radio car.

33:09.250 --> 33:10.410
You got it.

33:21.530 --> 33:22.622
Gita Singh?

33:22.660 --> 33:24.127
Yes?

33:24.170 --> 33:25.296
Where's your husband,
Robert?

33:25.330 --> 33:26.661
Check the house.
What's going on?

33:26.700 --> 33:29.032
We're on scene.
We have_ a warrant.
Where is Robert?

33:29.070 --> 33:30.435
He's with the woman
he left me for.

33:30.470 --> 33:31.459
If you find him,

33:31.510 --> 33:33.137
tell him
I'm tossing his crap.

33:33.170 --> 33:34.535
What did he do?
We think he's connected

33:34.580 --> 33:36.207
to three homicides
tied to a bombing.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.468
What?!
You think Robert...?

33:37.510 --> 33:39.102
Wait, does this
have to do with

33:39.150 --> 33:41.118
that yacht in the harbor
with his boss?

33:41.150 --> 33:42.219
Tell us what you know about it.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.389
Nothing.
But there was this

33:44.420 --> 33:46.388
friend of Robert's
that came by.

33:46.420 --> 33:49.059
This man?
Robert's
Coast Guard friend...

33:49.090 --> 33:50.387
he was supposed
to leave a,

33:50.420 --> 33:51.648
a package
on the workbench.

33:51.690 --> 33:52.782
I brought him
back here.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.718
And he looked out back,

33:54.760 --> 33:56.057
but he freaked out.

33:56.100 --> 33:57.692
Al.

34:00.530 --> 34:04.136
Those ATF guys used
O4 to clear trees

34:04.170 --> 34:06.206
for pools and patios...
right?

34:06.240 --> 34:07.264
Yeah.

34:07.310 --> 34:08.334
Look around you.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.507
Not a tree or a stump.

34:10.540 --> 34:13.373
Singh must've
lied to Callahan

34:13.410 --> 34:15.275
about why
he needed the C-4.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.641
Callahan thought he was
giving him the explosive

34:17.680 --> 34:19.147
for some
harmless yard work.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.748
He saw something was
off, got spooked.

34:20.790 --> 34:22.678
Mrs. Singh,
please, think hard.

34:22.720 --> 34:24.358
Was there anything else?

34:24.390 --> 34:25.755
Yeah, uh,
he took something off

34:25.790 --> 34:27.223
the workbench
and ran out.

34:27.260 --> 34:29.399
It was crazy, I called
the neighborhood watch...

34:29.430 --> 34:30.454
AL:
What did he take?

34:30.500 --> 34:32.798
I'm not sure. I-It looked
like some blueprints.

34:32.830 --> 34:35.264
Schematics.
You didn't think to

34:35.300 --> 34:36.767
call the police
after the yacht explosion?

34:36.800 --> 34:38.165
Well, I read about it

34:38.210 --> 34:39.837
but never thought,
never even considered...

34:41.310 --> 34:42.709
Butthen".
I didn't know

34:42.740 --> 34:44.708
Robert was in love
with Giuliana Lantini.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.308
HOST:
Okay, Marco just left

34:46.350 --> 34:48.477
for a party at Chelsea Piers.

34:53.150 --> 34:54.515
Your husband
knew Giuliana

34:54.560 --> 34:56.380
before she was famous,
didn't he?

34:56.420 --> 34:57.648
They have a history,

34:57.690 --> 34:59.123
they worked at the same diner.

34:59.160 --> 35:00.479
Yeah.

35:00.530 --> 35:02.327
They both
can go to hell.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.863
Wait.

35:04.900 --> 35:07.198
My uncle had these on his
boat-- they're waterproof.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.868
Does your husband have a boat?

35:08.900 --> 35:11.368
Yeah. I mean, I haven't
been on it in like ten years;

35:11.410 --> 35:12.365
I get seasick.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.604
Where does he
keep it?

35:13.640 --> 35:14.732
I'm not sure.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.407
Some place here
on Staten Island.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.340
Okay, there are like
a dozen marinas.

35:18.380 --> 35:19.574
Does he have records,
receipts?

35:24.420 --> 35:25.785
Any paperwork
connected to the boat

35:25.820 --> 35:27.481
that might tell us
where he keeps it?

35:27.520 --> 35:28.612
Uh...

35:28.660 --> 35:30.355
We're good.

35:30.390 --> 35:32.483
We're good.
Thank you, Mrs. Singh.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.498
The sticker
on that waterproof notebook

35:34.530 --> 35:35.758
has the same logo on it

35:35.800 --> 35:38.268
_as_a metal box I saw
Sinking in the wreckage.

35:38.300 --> 35:40.894
The box Singh used
to get that bomb on board.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.659
Island Point Marina.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.759
Callahan went to the_ restaurant
to confront Singh.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.835
Singh hears about it,
he goes to Callahan,

35:46.870 --> 35:48.508
shoots him,
takes the C-4.

35:48.540 --> 35:49.768
If Singh is on
his boat,

35:49.810 --> 35:51.641
my bet is,
Giuliana's on it, too.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.772
Giuliana has
a home in Bermuda;

35:52.810 --> 35:53.879
they're heading there.

35:53.910 --> 35:56.447
Detective.
House is clear.

35:56.480 --> 35:59.847
Stay here,
secure the location.

35:59.890 --> 36:02.358
Jay, send Sewell
and backup

36:02.390 --> 36:03.789
to Island Point Marina.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.459
We're in the
right place.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.400
GIULIANA:
Robert, please.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.737
Please don't do this.
Just let me go.

36:23.780 --> 36:25.645
Police! Don't move!
Help me!

36:25.680 --> 36:27.545
He's got a gun on him.
Please, help me!

36:27.580 --> 36:28.774
Coast Guard's here.
There's no way out, Singh.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.414
Let's go.
Stay back!
Robert!

36:31.450 --> 36:32.781
Drop the gun!

36:32.820 --> 36:34.754
ROBERT: Move back!
Robert, please.

36:34.790 --> 36:37.588
Please, don't do this.
Just let me go.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.655
Stay back, I said!

36:42.660 --> 36:44.298
All right,

36:44.330 --> 36:46.264
I said, move back,
or I swear,

36:46.300 --> 36:47.699
I will kill her!

36:47.730 --> 36:48.958
Come on.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.888
Don't make me do this!

36:50.940 --> 36:52.601
Let's go! Keep moving!
Let's go!

36:52.640 --> 36:53.868
I can't get a clear shot.

36:53.910 --> 36:56.299
Don't make me do it!

36:56.340 --> 36:58.342
Just let us go,
all right? Just let us go.

36:58.380 --> 36:59.870
Back up! Back u |
Back up! p.

36:59.910 --> 37:01.468
Robert!

37:02.520 --> 37:04.579
I'm putting my gun away, okay?

37:04.620 --> 37:05.689
I just want to

37:05.720 --> 37:06.812
talk to you.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.715
No, you're liars.

37:08.760 --> 37:09.886
_You'r_e liars
like Giuliana.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.285
I told you
to back off!

37:11.330 --> 37:12.729
You've known Giuliana since...

37:12.760 --> 37:14.751
way back in the day
when you both had nothing.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.290
You loved her.

37:16.330 --> 37:17.729
Since you guys worked

37:17.760 --> 37:18.988
at that diner together,

37:19.030 --> 37:20.292
the one with the
little blue booths.

37:20.330 --> 37:21.991
You know...

37:22.040 --> 37:23.962
you know who she really is.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.865
Remember?

37:25.910 --> 37:26.968
I do remember.

37:27.010 --> 37:28.637
She chose Marco,
the rich one.

37:30.410 --> 37:31.900
And she's
doing it again.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.009
She was gonna go to Rome
with him to forget about me.

37:34.050 --> 37:37.918
She's never gonna
forget about you.

37:37.950 --> 37:39.315
Look at her.

37:39.350 --> 37:42.012
She's still the same
Giuliana you knew

37:42.060 --> 37:43.379
back in the diner

37:43.420 --> 37:44.978
all those years ago.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.624
You don't want to hurt her.

37:47.660 --> 37:50.720
Let her go.
Let her go.

37:51.930 --> 37:54.490
Please, just let her go.

37:59.870 --> 38:01.531
Oh!

38:01.580 --> 38:03.434
AL:
You all right?

38:03.480 --> 38:05.277
I got her; go
after Singh.

39:10.440 --> 39:11.668
Robert Singh,

39:11.710 --> 39:12.847
you're under arrest
for the murders of

39:12.880 --> 39:14.745
Marco Lantini
and Ataru Yamato.

39:25.990 --> 39:28.857
Sir, did you kill
Marco Lantini?

39:30.030 --> 39:32.419
WOMAN:
Anything else
you can tell us?

39:34.900 --> 39:36.390
Oh... Hello, Eliot.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.000
The press needs to know
if order has been restored

39:39.040 --> 39:40.132
to the gastronomic universe.

39:40.170 --> 39:41.671
How's Giuliana?

39:41.710 --> 39:43.007
Okay, considering
the circumstances.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.598
Well,
she's not going to

39:44.650 --> 39:46.140
keep that mob
off her for long.

39:46.180 --> 39:47.374
Price of fame.

39:48.480 --> 39:49.708
Speaking of which...

39:49.750 --> 39:51.479
I have a press conference.

39:55.860 --> 39:56.781
Great work out there.

39:56.820 --> 39:58.754
Hey, Al, what do you say
we head up for some

39:58.790 --> 39:59.984
deep sea fishing sometime?

40:00.030 --> 40:01.895
There's lots of room
on the boat for three.

40:01.930 --> 40:04.091
That sounds nice.

40:04.130 --> 40:06.166
You know?
Two strapping men,

40:06.200 --> 40:08.760
the open sea, sunshine,
me in a tiny bikini...

40:08.800 --> 40:10.563
I'm in on the fishing,
but we got to get back.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.636
Later, Chuck.
Bye, Chuck.

40:14.610 --> 40:17.170
Do_I detect a little
jealousy, Al?

40:17.210 --> 40:18.643
Jealousy?
Yeah.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.749
I don't get jealous.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.748
Uh, excuse me.
October 19, 2001,

40:21.780 --> 40:23.714
you nearly rearranged
that guy's face...

40:23.750 --> 40:25.149
at Smokin' Joe's Bar
in Syracuse.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.647
Remember that?
The handsy
French professor?

40:27.690 --> 40:28.759
No. No. No.
That guy who tried to play

40:28.790 --> 40:29.779
the "no" game with me.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.014
Oh...
Oh, that guy...

40:32.660 --> 40:34.457
I may have overreacted.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.853
It was kind of hot, though.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.926
You've always been overly
protective of me, still are.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.460
Always will be.

40:40.500 --> 40:41.797
Aw...

40:41.840 --> 40:43.637
Buy you a drink?

40:45.240 --> 40:47.538
Only if you admit
that you're jealous.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.538
A little bit.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.800
Mission accomplished.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.841
You can buy me
a drink.
