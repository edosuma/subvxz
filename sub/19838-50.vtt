00:02.080 --> 00:04.020
<b>Midnight</b>

02:01.970 --> 02:06.980
<b>Monster x And x Monster</b>

02:22.030 --> 02:26.820
<b>The moment Killua entered the palace...</b>

02:26.820 --> 02:28.020
<b><i>I knew it!</i></b>

02:28.400 --> 02:29.490
<b>...was his reaction.</b>

02:31.190 --> 02:33.700
<b>He couldn't sense Pitou's <i>En</i> at all,</b>

02:34.100 --> 02:40.010
<b>and before him stood Youpi, whom nobody had 
expected to encounter on the first floor.</b>

02:41.210 --> 02:43.070
<b>Despite the fact that they were now</b>

02:43.070 --> 02:46.390
<b>in a situation that was utterly 
unforeseen in their planning,</b>

02:47.120 --> 02:51.020
<b>Killua's experience helped him stay calm.</b>

02:54.090 --> 02:55.860
<b><i>Who are these guys?</i></b>

02:55.860 --> 02:57.530
<b><i>Where did they come from?</i></b>

02:58.490 --> 03:02.530
<b>From Youpi's perspective, too, 
his current situation was an impossibility.</b>

03:02.780 --> 03:05.720
<b>Youpi immediately ceased all thought.</b>

03:35.950 --> 03:37.680
<b>I am a shield.</b>

03:38.030 --> 03:41.200
<b>I protect the King with my body.</b>

03:41.770 --> 03:47.140
<b>Of the Royal Guard, Youpi alone was 
created from Magical Beasts, not humans.</b>

03:47.660 --> 03:49.450
<b>Perhaps that was why</b>

03:49.450 --> 03:53.010
<b>he lacked the self-preservative 
nature of the other two Royal Guard.</b>

03:53.010 --> 03:55.710
<b>However, that lack also gave him strength.</b>

04:01.770 --> 04:06.160
<b>The moment Youpi changed 
forms with a belligerent smile,</b>

04:06.160 --> 04:08.180
<b>Shoot froze at once.</b>

04:13.970 --> 04:18.980
<b>However, it wasn't because 
Shoot was slow to react.</b>

04:19.750 --> 04:23.990
<b><i>If I move any closer, he will attack.</i></b>

04:25.140 --> 04:30.740
<b><i>And if his attack happens to connect with 
the invisible Knuckle and Meleoron...</i></b>

04:33.790 --> 04:37.500
<b>In order to draw Youpi's attention toward himself,</b>

04:37.840 --> 04:41.270
<b>he began to move his cage and floating arms...</b>

04:42.260 --> 04:43.620
<b>And then it happened.</b>

04:58.430 --> 05:00.870
<b><i>This is Dragon Dive!</i></b>

05:03.270 --> 05:05.320
<b><i>Then the old man's friend is...</i></b>

05:05.960 --> 05:08.680
<b>Only Killua understood what was happening,</b>

05:08.680 --> 05:10.590
<b>and it momentarily froze him.</b>

05:11.670 --> 05:15.390
<b>The shock was even greater to those 
who didn't know what was going on.</b>

05:16.830 --> 05:19.660
<b>There were only two present,</b>

05:23.200 --> 05:26.840
<b>Gon and Youpi, who remained focused 
on the enemy that faced them.</b>

05:27.580 --> 05:28.340
<b><i>No way!</i></b>

05:28.930 --> 05:30.100
<b><i>Has he lost it?</i></b>

05:30.630 --> 05:33.120
<b><i>You aren't supposed to fight Youpi...</i></b>

05:33.710 --> 05:36.120
<b><i>No, wait.</i></b>

05:43.480 --> 05:45.810
<b>Realization came a moment later to Killua,</b>

05:45.810 --> 05:49.900
<b>and still a few moments later to the others.</b>

05:51.820 --> 05:55.820
<b><i>Seriously, even in this situation,</i></b>

05:55.820 --> 05:59.380
<b><i>how did he realize that, and so quickly?</i></b>

06:00.480 --> 06:06.910
<b>If Meleoron and Knuckle were to 
be pierced by a Dragon Lance</b>

06:06.910 --> 06:11.470
<b>while God's Accomplice was 
active, and die instantly,</b>

06:12.170 --> 06:14.390
<b>would their invisibility cease?</b>

06:15.390 --> 06:22.350
<b>Or would the <i>Nen</i> remain, leaving them to 
decompose without anyone ever knowing?</b>

06:22.780 --> 06:24.650
<b>No one knew the answer.</b>

06:25.580 --> 06:31.620
<b>Assuming the latter, confirming whether they 
were still alive would be impossible.</b>

06:32.780 --> 06:36.420
<b>Meaning that, in the worst-case 
scenario, someone else would</b>

06:36.420 --> 06:38.660
<b>have to deal with Youpi.</b>

06:40.600 --> 06:42.920
<b><i>That should have been my job...</i></b>

06:44.680 --> 06:45.670
<b><i>Gon!</i></b>

06:46.520 --> 06:48.170
<b><i>Shoot did nothing wrong.</i></b>

06:48.770 --> 06:52.350
<b><i>Even I was later than Killua 
in noticing and reacting.</i></b>

06:55.100 --> 06:57.430
<b><i>Shoot, don't blame yourself...</i></b>

06:58.040 --> 06:59.790
<b><i>Pull yourself together!</i></b>

07:00.330 --> 07:02.190
<b><i>If Gon and Killua are taking Youpi,</i></b>

07:02.780 --> 07:04.380
<b><i>you're left with Pitou!</i></b>

07:07.980 --> 07:09.340
<b>However,</b>

07:09.340 --> 07:14.400
<b>Shoot was feeling a completely 
different emotion at that moment.</b>

07:16.550 --> 07:17.660
<b><i>Gon!</i></b>

07:18.390 --> 07:21.340
<b><i>I want to tell the entire world...</i></b>

07:22.100 --> 07:23.820
<b><i>"This is Gon!</i></b>

07:25.580 --> 07:28.290
<b><i>A boy less than half my age,</i></b>

07:29.270 --> 07:31.060
<b><i>to whom I owe my life."</i></b>

07:32.980 --> 07:37.580
<b><i>I've always gone to any lengths 
to avoid facing danger and risk,</i></b>

07:37.580 --> 07:44.320
<b><i>hiding myself within a safe cage, 
where no one could hurt me.</i></b>

07:46.510 --> 07:48.980
<b><i>I hated myself for it...</i></b>

07:49.810 --> 07:51.870
<b><i>But I couldn't change myself.</i></b>

07:52.980 --> 07:57.080
<b><i>Friends and teachers encouraged me,</i></b>

07:57.080 --> 08:00.730
<b><i>but I never truly listened, 
considering it the logic of the strong.</i></b>

08:01.550 --> 08:03.500
<b><i>Yet somehow...</i></b>

08:06.500 --> 08:09.840
<b><i>A boy with less than half my strength</i></b>

08:11.880 --> 08:14.470
<b><i>managed to break my cage!</i></b>

08:17.890 --> 08:22.640
<b>Shoot did indeed tend to shrink 
back weakly from opportunity.</b>

08:24.040 --> 08:25.650
<b><i>I will survive...</i></b>

08:26.870 --> 08:28.400
<b><i>So that I can thank you!</i></b>

08:29.140 --> 08:31.320
<b>However, even he didn't realize that</b>

08:31.320 --> 08:37.460
<b>such unique turns in his train of thought 
made him shine in the face of adversity.</b>

08:40.100 --> 08:41.140
<b><i>Good!</i></b>

09:11.190 --> 09:12.540
<b><i>Knuckle and Meleoron...</i></b>

09:13.090 --> 09:13.940
<b><i>...are alive!</i></b>

09:39.590 --> 09:40.700
<b><i>What?</i></b>

09:44.520 --> 09:47.550
<b><i>Who was it that just attacked me?</i></b>

09:50.980 --> 09:52.440
<b><i>I couldn't see a thing...</i></b>

09:53.040 --> 09:55.580
<b><i>Did someone fire a projectile from my blind spot?</i></b>

10:04.790 --> 10:07.300
<b>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, activate!</b>

10:08.370 --> 10:12.930
<b>Naturally, they had already tested 
to confirm that God's Accomplice</b>

10:12.930 --> 10:15.770
<b>would be compatible with Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.</b>

10:16.620 --> 10:22.310
<b>As long as God's Accomplice stayed active, 
Youpi would be unable to see APR.</b>

10:22.760 --> 10:25.870
<b>Thus, it was natural that Youpi would question</b>

10:25.870 --> 10:30.880
<b>what had just happened, rather than 
concentrate on the enemies before him.</b>

10:32.780 --> 10:34.730
<b><i>I can't sense any damage or abnormal effect.</i></b>

10:35.400 --> 10:37.990
<b><i>Which means my focus right now should be...</i></b>

10:49.470 --> 10:53.140
<b>So far, everything had proceeded 
according to the Hunters' plan.</b>

10:53.910 --> 11:00.130
<b>However, after a successful first strike, 
Knuckle could only shudder.</b>

11:02.190 --> 11:03.640
<b><i>Seriously?</i></b>

11:06.690 --> 11:08.600
<b><i>It's like his aura is unlimited!</i></b>

11:17.040 --> 11:20.510
<b>After surviving over five thousand battles,</b>

11:20.510 --> 11:23.980
<b>Knuckle had the experience and intuition 
to quantify his opponent's strength.</b>

11:24.790 --> 11:28.620
<b>It was not uncommon for him to 
face enemies who were stronger</b>

11:28.620 --> 11:30.550
<b>than previous opponents he had encountered.</b>

11:34.160 --> 11:38.270
<b>However, there was no comparing 
the power he now faced</b>

11:38.270 --> 11:42.570
<b>to that of the opponents who had come before.</b>

11:43.990 --> 11:47.930
<b>A monster with an immense amount of aura.</b>

11:51.790 --> 11:53.110
<b><i>Five times what the boss has?</i></b>

11:53.740 --> 11:54.570
<b><i>Ten times?</i></b>

11:55.420 --> 11:56.520
<b><i>More?</i></b>

11:58.070 --> 11:59.550
<b><i>I can't tell!</i></b>

12:00.350 --> 12:02.750
<b>He had never experienced anything like this.</b>

12:12.750 --> 12:15.940
<b><i>Assuming he's ten times stronger,</i></b>

12:17.230 --> 12:19.620
<b><i>with 700,000 aura,</i></b>

12:21.500 --> 12:23.740
<b><i>how long will it take before he goes bust?</i></b>

12:33.480 --> 12:34.270
<b><i>The King!</i></b>

12:38.110 --> 12:39.140
<b>That was when</b>

12:41.600 --> 12:43.740
<b>the Hunters felt</b>

12:44.930 --> 12:47.490
<b>the full brunt of Pitou's sinister aura.</b>

12:48.800 --> 12:52.540
<b>Youpi immediately noticed 
that momentary hesitation.</b>

12:54.080 --> 12:57.030
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

13:08.880 --> 13:10.680
<b>Your Majesty!</b>

13:29.790 --> 13:32.340
<b>Since Pitou lacked wings,</b>

13:32.340 --> 13:36.010
<b>the only option was to continue free falling.</b>

13:36.460 --> 13:38.570
<b>This was actually a stroke of luck.</b>

13:39.560 --> 13:41.720
<b>Had there been unlimited courses of action,</b>

13:41.720 --> 13:46.710
<b>Pitou would have joined Pouf and 
rushed straight toward the King,</b>

13:46.710 --> 13:49.430
<b>a Royal Guard's natural reaction.</b>

13:49.910 --> 13:53.220
<b>In that scenario, it's unlikely 
that Pitou would have had</b>

13:53.220 --> 13:55.040
<b>the presence of mind to use <i>En</i>.</b>

13:56.850 --> 13:57.870
<b>As a result...</b>

14:08.550 --> 14:11.080
<b><i>The guest room on the second 
floor of the west tower...</i></b>

14:13.390 --> 14:16.460
<b><i>The King is with the woman with closed eyes.</i></b>

14:32.300 --> 14:34.950
<b><i>They're also using</i> En <i>to locate the King!</i></b>

14:35.860 --> 14:42.660
<b>This was when Pitou realized the 
seriousness of the situation.</b>

14:43.570 --> 14:48.300
<b>In that instant, Pitou crouched like the 
four-legged creature of the Ant's origin,</b>

14:48.780 --> 14:50.950
<b>with upper legs tensing like steel</b>

14:50.950 --> 14:56.470
<b>until they were twice as large as they'd 
been before the attack on Kite.</b>

15:14.540 --> 15:16.320
<b>In order to reach the King</b>

15:17.140 --> 15:19.190
<b>before the enemy could.</b>

15:22.070 --> 15:23.900
<b>But a second later...</b>

15:33.170 --> 15:38.430
<b>A wave of negative energy from Pitou's destination</b>

15:38.700 --> 15:42.960
<b>was strong enough to make 
Pitou regret the decision.</b>

15:45.320 --> 15:46.540
<b><i>This is...</i></b>

15:46.930 --> 15:47.950
<b><i>the King's...</i></b>

15:50.000 --> 15:52.450
<b>The aura coming from the King</b>

15:52.450 --> 15:56.930
<b>was so unmasked, his current state 
of mind was plain to read.</b>

15:57.580 --> 16:00.620
<b>As a result, Pitou could only conclude</b>

16:00.620 --> 16:06.590
<b>that the situation had grown 
even worse than previously thought.</b>

17:01.520 --> 17:04.500
<b>The main stairway had collapsed!</b>

18:00.350 --> 18:05.180
<b>When the King looked down, 
time began to move again.</b>

18:05.830 --> 18:09.820
<b>However, time remained frozen for everyone else.</b>

18:17.060 --> 18:20.630
<b>The intruders, who had come for the King's life,</b>

18:21.200 --> 18:24.200
<b>were holding their breath and standing still</b>

18:25.380 --> 18:27.210
<b>because of the girl covered in blood.</b>

18:28.150 --> 18:32.960
<b>And because the grotesque 
creature holding her body</b>

18:33.420 --> 18:38.440
<b>was clearly treating her with tenderness and care.</b>

18:58.500 --> 18:59.490
<b>Pitou.</b>

18:59.690 --> 19:01.490
<b>Y-Yes, sir.</b>

19:02.840 --> 19:06.030
<b>The expression on the King's face 
had returned to normal.</b>

19:06.480 --> 19:09.850
<b>This only increased Pitou's concern.</b>

19:12.710 --> 19:14.500
<b>Heal Komugi.</b>

19:15.530 --> 19:16.700
<b>I'm counting on you.</b>

19:43.080 --> 19:47.760
<b>The two veterans continued to stand by,</b>

19:47.760 --> 19:50.720
<b>silently watching their enemies,</b>

19:50.720 --> 19:52.480
<b>out of respect.</b>

19:59.820 --> 20:04.120
<b>This was an act of love for a life.</b>

20:08.900 --> 20:12.580
<b>Should they infringe upon that act, 
their cause was lost.</b>

20:12.930 --> 20:14.670
<b>It would have been inhumane.</b>

20:21.030 --> 20:24.580
<b>This isn't what I was given to expect.</b>

20:25.050 --> 20:28.110
<b>For Zeno to make that comment was only natural.</b>

20:28.670 --> 20:31.960
<b>Netero felt the same way.</b>

20:37.100 --> 20:38.590
<b>Not here.</b>

20:41.690 --> 20:43.260
<b>Let us go elsewhere.</b>

20:44.210 --> 20:46.510
<b>I believe that a different location</b>

20:48.400 --> 20:50.440
<b>would be to your benefit, as well.</b>

20:52.220 --> 20:57.360
<b>Netero had spent a great deal of money 
to enlist Zeno to help separate</b>

20:57.360 --> 20:59.880
<b>the King from the Royal Guard.</b>

21:00.450 --> 21:02.250
<b>He had no reason to object to the King's proposal.</b>

21:02.980 --> 21:04.110
<b>However...</b>

21:05.120 --> 21:07.040
<b>Well, I suppose.</b>

21:07.850 --> 21:11.890
<b>He could not help but feel 
he had lost the initiative...</b>

21:18.010 --> 21:19.540
<b><i>Doctor Blythe.</i></b>

21:23.710 --> 21:26.890
<b>The moment Pitou's ability was activated,</b>

21:33.700 --> 21:36.680
<b>the two men thought that their decision</b>

21:36.680 --> 21:39.550
<b>to lower their guard would prove fatal.</b>

21:45.400 --> 21:52.360
<b>Because the King was able to walk 
between them with ease.</b>

21:56.160 --> 21:59.910
<b>Their opponent, also, was an incredible monster.</b>

23:24.520 --> 23:26.920
<b>Next time: An x Indebted x Insect.</b>

23:26.920 --> 23:29.070
<b>Gon, what are you eating?</b>

23:29.070 --> 23:31.530
<b>Oh, it's candy. Gummy insects.</b>

23:31.530 --> 23:33.850
<b>I-Insects that are candy?</b>
