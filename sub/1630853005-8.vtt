WEBVTT

00:05.039 --> 00:05.740
<i>Previously...</i>

00:06.006 --> 00:07.441
<i>Brianna,
what do you truly believe?</i>

00:07.708 --> 00:10.644
Roger, how could I ever know for sure
that Jemmy is his?

00:10.711 --> 00:11.779
<i>News of our death.</i>

00:12.079 --> 00:13.280
<i>We die in a fire.</i>

00:13.347 --> 00:14.515
King George
and Royal Governor

00:14.582 --> 00:16.384
Josiah Martin send you these rifles.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.352
I will fight with you, Bear Killer.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.088
He's asked if I might
preach the sermon on Sunday.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.723
<i>As a lay minister, of course.</i>

00:22.790 --> 00:25.025
- Why doesn't Tom do it?
- Well, Tom's not a preacher.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.060
Neither are you.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.195
What if I want to make
the preaching official?

00:28.262 --> 00:29.797
There's a Presbytery in Edenton.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.265
<i>We'll leave as soon as we can.</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:32.733
<i>Your wife stands before us</i>

00:32.800 --> 00:34.535
<i>up to her elbows in blood.</i>

00:34.602 --> 00:36.670
I don't think we're implying anything.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.340
<i>After that dreadful
accusation and her confessing</i>

00:39.407 --> 00:41.075
to all and sundry in the meeting place,

00:41.142 --> 00:43.778
that it was Mr. Fraser's bairn
she was carrying.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.414
Mr. Fraser, we've come for your wife,

00:46.480 --> 00:49.650

02:33.487 --> 02:35.222
<i>The murder of Malva Christie.</i>

02:36.824 --> 02:38.392
Ye'll leave my land, sir.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.729
And ye'll do it now.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.364
Oh, we'll leave.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.734
Hand over your wife,
and we'll be gone.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.371
Vanished like the morning dew.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.606
Bride save us.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.209
Mrs. Bug, go get help now.

02:56.443 --> 02:57.811
<i>By what right
do you come here?</i>

02:59.446 --> 03:01.582
I'm only doin' what I must.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.885
I ken what ye're doin'.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.489
<i>I am the Committee of Safety,
Mr. Fraser.</i>

03:11.458 --> 03:14.495
<i>I have a responsibility
to the people of these parts.</i>

03:18.632 --> 03:20.701
I have a responsibility as well.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.804
Oh, I know it.
I'm a married man myself.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.309
I didn't expect you to just give her up,

03:28.375 --> 03:30.978
<i>but you will soon enough.</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:34.214
You'll see.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.768
Stop there.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.571
Don't shoot.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.542
Hand me that fowling piece.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.477
All right, I will.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.252
- Claire!
- <i>Arrest him!</i>

04:14.888 --> 04:18.392
Goddamn. You shot me.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.794
I did, and I'll bloody do it again

04:20.861 --> 04:22.262
if you don't get out of here!

04:50.724 --> 04:51.725
Duck!

04:55.396 --> 04:56.497
Jamie!

04:57.765 --> 04:59.333
Claire! Get inside!

05:02.603 --> 05:04.004
Bloody hell!
Are you all right?

05:04.972 --> 05:06.940
Here.
It's primed and loaded.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.842
Front door. Claire!

05:14.815 --> 05:16.717
Claire, the table!

05:29.596 --> 05:31.365
<i>Turn her over, Fraser!</i>

05:36.837 --> 05:38.505
Close the shutters.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.774
We need more guns.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.677
<i>You three,
get around the other side!</i>

05:45.546 --> 05:48.382
<i>Give it up.
You're outnumbered!</i>

05:51.885 --> 05:52.753
Claire!

06:17.010 --> 06:18.011
Claire!

06:18.078 --> 06:18.912
<i>I'm all right!</i>

06:25.552 --> 06:26.920
<i>Take cover!</i>

06:33.026 --> 06:33.961
Go!

06:38.966 --> 06:42.669
Go to the dining room.
Cover the South and East.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.838
- Let them think Josiah's in here wi' us.
- All right.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.041
Go now, Claire.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.545
<i>Surrender, Fraser!</i>

07:15.135 --> 07:16.737
<i>Fire!</i>

07:27.481 --> 07:28.949
Can anybody see them?

07:31.485 --> 07:32.786
Get back, ye bastards!

07:35.923 --> 07:37.758
<i>Surround the house!</i>

07:49.670 --> 07:50.771
Ah!

07:51.104 --> 07:53.006
<i>Back up, back up!</i>

07:58.245 --> 07:59.646
<i>Reload!</i>

08:00.948 --> 08:02.482
We need cover!

08:06.186 --> 08:08.488
<i>We've got you
at all four, Mr. Fraser!</i>

08:08.555 --> 08:10.057
<i>This is what he wanted.</i>

08:10.123 --> 08:12.893
Not to arrest ye,
but to have cause to kill ye,

08:12.960 --> 08:13.827
<i>kill us all.</i>

08:14.094 --> 08:16.630
<i>It's a good thing
the wee ones got away safe.</i>

08:16.697 --> 08:19.032
Brown found out it was Marsali
killed his brother.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.235
So that's what
all this has been about?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.238
Malva's death
is but an excuse for revenge.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.606
<i>Fraser!</i>

08:28.242 --> 08:31.645
Come one step closer, man.
One shot is all I need.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.183
Fraser!
Can you hear me?

08:40.287 --> 08:42.022
What's the matter with you?

08:42.089 --> 08:44.291
You never heard of a flag o' truce,

08:44.558 --> 08:45.859
<i>you horse-stealing Scotcher?</i>

08:47.728 --> 08:49.730
If I wanted ye dead, man,

08:49.796 --> 08:51.798
ye'd be coolin' this minute!

08:51.865 --> 08:53.166
Say yer piece.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.269
<i>You know what I want.</i>

08:57.638 --> 09:00.007
I want
that murderous witch of yours.

09:02.843 --> 09:03.911
Goddamn it!

09:11.885 --> 09:12.786
Look.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.859
We ain't gonna hurt her!

09:20.794 --> 09:22.863
<i>We only mean
to take her to Salisbury.</i>

09:24.798 --> 09:25.999
<i>There's a court there.</i>

09:27.200 --> 09:28.835
<i>She'll get a fair trial.</i>

09:32.706 --> 09:35.742
That's the law, ain't it?

09:40.347 --> 09:41.882
<i>Ye have my answer.</i>

09:47.254 --> 09:49.089
Hold your fire!

10:08.175 --> 10:09.943
<i>Lexington and Concord,</i>

10:10.010 --> 10:11.244
<i>the Siege of Boston.</i>

10:12.245 --> 10:14.181
Those've all happened.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.717
It'll seem like the end of the world.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.252
Up until recently,

10:19.319 --> 10:21.154
I'd've sold my soul to be up there.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.725
But my soul is being pulled
another way now.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.159
And as a father,

10:27.227 --> 10:30.130
well, that's one benefit
of knowing the rest.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.965
I'm pretty sure
there won't be any battles

10:32.032 --> 10:33.266
in Edenton Seminary.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.670
We'll all be safe.

10:39.706 --> 10:40.841
When do we tell Jemmy?

10:42.075 --> 10:43.043
Do we tell him?

10:43.110 --> 10:44.678
About the war?

10:45.212 --> 10:49.416
About how we know about the things
that haven't happened yet.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.251
Time travel.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.286
Uh-oh!

10:53.353 --> 10:54.388
<i>Maybe we don't.</i>

10:55.655 --> 10:57.357
Christ, how do you tell a kid
something like that?

10:58.892 --> 11:00.093
I dunno.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.729
You'd tell them if they were adopted

11:02.796 --> 11:04.731
or if there's some family scandal,

11:04.798 --> 11:08.101
like their favorite Uncle's not dead,
he's in prison.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.170
If you tell them early on,

11:10.237 --> 11:11.738
it doesn't mean that much to them,

11:11.805 --> 11:13.206
I don't think.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.142
If they find out later, it's a shock.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.410
You'd know.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.745
So would you.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.181
At least with you, it wasn't a choice.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.383
It's not like the reverend
could have told you

11:23.450 --> 11:25.085
what you were but didn't.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.455
So you think your parents
should have told you sooner?

11:30.457 --> 11:31.892
Yes.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.761
And no.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.730
I mean, I can see why they didn't.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.965
Daddy didn't even
believe it to start with.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.002
As for what he did believe, well,

11:43.136 --> 11:45.105
whatever it was, he did ask Mama

11:45.172 --> 11:47.808
to let me think he was my real father.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.342
She gave him her word.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.212
I guess I-I don't think
she should have broken it, no.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.016
Well, it may not
mean that much to Jemmy

11:56.083 --> 11:58.218
if we tell him early on,
but it's definitely gonna get

11:58.285 --> 12:00.487
the attention of his friends
when he starts telling them.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.857
<i>We're lucky he doesn't
remember going to the stones.</i>

12:03.924 --> 12:05.725
So we wait until
he's old enough to realize

12:05.792 --> 12:07.094
he can't tell people.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.328
That it's a secret.

12:08.995 --> 12:10.764
There's another risk for us
in telling him.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.399
What's that?

12:13.433 --> 12:15.135
He might decide to leave us one day.

12:19.806 --> 12:20.874
Come on, man.

12:50.904 --> 12:51.905
Is there water?

12:51.972 --> 12:54.908
Uh, yes.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.285
Here.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.288
<i>Shall I go get some more?</i>

13:08.855 --> 13:09.856
No. This'll do.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.793
It's no' going to be a long siege, Claire.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.098
It's gettin' late.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.366
What do you mean by that?

13:21.201 --> 13:22.869
What do you think they'll do?

13:22.936 --> 13:25.305
Fire the house as soon
as it gets dark, I suppose.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.342
You think they're going to burn us?

13:29.943 --> 13:31.478
<i>That's what I would do
in their shoes.</i>

13:32.479 --> 13:34.114
Smoke us out.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.383
Or burn us alive.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.519
Aye.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.355
It couldn't be, could it?

13:44.391 --> 13:48.495
The obituary said the Sabbath
before the 21st of January.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.599
It's May, for heaven's sake.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.068
<i>I was a printer, Claire.</i>

13:55.302 --> 13:57.370
Ye canna trust everything
ye read in the broadsheets.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.173
That's reassuring.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.877
Then again, to be out
by more than four months...

14:03.944 --> 14:06.146
<i>All right.
So they smoke us out.</i>

14:06.213 --> 14:09.983
What do we do?
Fight to the death?

14:11.218 --> 14:13.386
I won't go with them, Jamie.
I'd rather die than--

14:13.453 --> 14:15.055
I would never let you go.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.225
So what's our plan?

14:18.291 --> 14:19.326
I'm still thinkin' on it.

14:21.061 --> 14:22.229
Mrs. Bug got out?

14:22.295 --> 14:24.097
I think so.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.633
She'll go for Arch first thing.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.369
If she finds him,
he'll run for Kenny Lindsay.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.172
He's closest.
Lizzie will go for Ronnie.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.907
- Lizzie?
- Aye.

14:34.474 --> 14:37.244
Saw her at the stables.
She ran East.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.480
<i>Dinna fash, mo nighean donn.</i>

14:41.214 --> 14:44.217
She'll be safe.
She's wi' her husband.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.419
Well, one o' them.

14:51.024 --> 14:54.928
That food'll have shot and glass in it,
I suppose.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.430
Food?

14:57.497 --> 15:00.200
Aye. In the dining room.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.501
I'm starvin'.

15:02.902 --> 15:06.539
It's quiet now, but we'll need
strength for what's to come.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.623
<i>You should be a woodworker.</i>

15:57.257 --> 15:58.692
Instead of a minister?

15:58.958 --> 16:01.027
In addition.
Like Jesus.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.663
Oh, man.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.669
Oh. Hmm.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.706
- That is a good one, isn't it?
- Yeah, mm-hm.

16:13.506 --> 16:17.444
Looks like yours.
The one we drove in Scotland.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.146
I was actually thinking
of that Mustang of yours.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.550
<i>Remember that time we drove up
into the mountains in North Carolina?</i>

16:24.351 --> 16:25.318
<i>I do.</i>

16:26.019 --> 16:27.620
You almost drove us off the road.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.190
Because someone thought it was a good idea

16:30.256 --> 16:33.226
to kiss me at 75 miles per hour.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.199
We almost broke up that weekend.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.001
We did break up that weekend.

16:42.068 --> 16:45.171
Yeah, but then I pursued you.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.073
Through time.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.210
Usual story.

16:54.180 --> 16:57.384
Mm, watch where
you're going there, Ace.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.320
I thought ye found speed erotic.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.394
Vroom, vroom.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.400
- Uh-uh, we'll wake Jemmy.
- Mm-mm.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.503
Nary a Ford Mustang could wake him.

17:18.805 --> 17:23.042
Do you think we'll ever
go 75 miles per hour again?

17:23.109 --> 17:24.477
Now what did I do with that car?

17:27.447 --> 17:29.249
<i>What do you need it for?</i>

17:29.582 --> 17:32.385
I just thought I might explore
the terrain a wee bit more.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.223
Well, you could explore on foot.

17:38.825 --> 17:43.263
Maybe I could.
It'll take a wee bit more time.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.799
<i>Mm.</i>

17:59.813 --> 18:03.850
Well, did you have
a longer journey in mind?

18:04.117 --> 18:07.620
Oh, aye. The scenic route.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.328
Mm...

18:21.334 --> 18:23.369
- Hang on, try--
- Okay.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.637
- I can't.
- Oh?

18:24.704 --> 18:25.638
Bump.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.674
All right.

19:37.944 --> 19:40.480
The condemned
ate a hearty meal.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.681
What?

19:42.715 --> 19:44.551
It's an American
tradition from my time.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.288
A prisoner condemned to death
is allowed to request

19:48.354 --> 19:49.889
whatever he wants for his last meal.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.257
Whatever he wants?

19:51.324 --> 19:52.191
<i>Within reason.</i>

19:52.258 --> 19:53.626
Hmm.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.628
I've heard it's often
something they remember

19:55.695 --> 19:56.763
from their childhood.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.466
Something their mother made them.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.403
What would you choose?

20:04.971 --> 20:07.840
Cheeseburger, fries,
and a Coke from Carmi's.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.643
<i>It's a diner,</i>

20:10.910 --> 20:13.646
a restaurant I used to take
Bree to when she was little.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.249
And that was our regular order.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.483
<i>Mm.</i>

20:17.550 --> 20:19.652
I wouldna choose any other thing...

20:21.854 --> 20:23.923
than this very meal

20:24.724 --> 20:25.625
wi' you...

20:28.695 --> 20:30.296
...in our home.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.369
<i>I'd always thought
being so close to death</i>

20:36.436 --> 20:38.538
<i>would make one too nervous to eat.</i>

20:40.740 --> 20:42.008
Apparently not.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.949
Where on Earth is Ian?

20:51.017 --> 20:53.319
<i>Surely, he should be here by now</i>

20:53.920 --> 20:56.255
if he'd heard the gunfire.

20:56.322 --> 20:59.559
Aye. Hunting, maybe.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.494
Where is everyone else?

21:02.829 --> 21:04.731
If they're no' here by now, Claire,

21:05.498 --> 21:07.033
then they'll no' be comin'.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.042
Why wouldn't they help us?

21:18.544 --> 21:22.448
They wouldn't turn Mrs. Bug
or Lizzie away at their doors.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.985
<i>Not unless they really believe
that I did it,</i>

21:26.052 --> 21:27.720
that I killed Malva.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.822
<i>Dinna fash, mo nighean donn.</i>

21:29.889 --> 21:33.393
Come. <i>Mo chridhe.</i>
Lie down.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.769
There's nothing else to do,
is there?

21:44.404 --> 21:46.606
Nothing else but wait.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.441
I might say
an Act of Contrition.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.879
We did that always
the night before a battle.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.648
Just in case.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.384
All right, then.
Just in case.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.826
Wait.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.428
You say it in French?

22:08.494 --> 22:09.896
Aye.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.832
I was fighting
wi' French mercenaries then.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.335
I didna want to stand out.

22:16.402 --> 22:18.705
<i>I can say it in Gaelic
or English if ye prefer.</i>

22:18.771 --> 22:22.375
English, please.
Just this once.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.612
<i>Oh, my God,</i>

22:27.580 --> 22:31.084
<i>I am heartily sorry for offending Thee.</i>

22:31.884 --> 22:35.621
I detest all my sins
for thy just punishments,

22:35.688 --> 22:40.526
but most of all, my God,
because they offend Thee.

22:40.593 --> 22:44.664
<i>My God who art all good</i>

22:45.431 --> 22:47.633
<i>and deserving of all my love.</i>

22:57.910 --> 23:02.081
How many times, would you say,
have I come close to dying?

23:04.450 --> 23:05.985
I don't know.

23:07.954 --> 23:11.023
You were dreadfully ill
at the abbey after Wentworth,

23:11.824 --> 23:13.559
<i>and after Culloden,</i>

23:13.626 --> 23:15.895
<i>you said you had a terrible
fever from your wounds.</i>

23:16.829 --> 23:18.564
<i>You thought you might die.</i>

23:19.165 --> 23:21.167
Only Jenny nursed you through it.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.436
Hmm, forced me through it, more like.

23:23.603 --> 23:24.604
Hmm.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.973
That's when Laoghaire
tried to kill you.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.574
And you forced me through that.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.078
And likewise when the snake bit me.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.747
Do you count the shipwreck?

23:34.814 --> 23:36.749
You almost died then, not me.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.684
Very well, then.
Have it your way.

23:38.751 --> 23:39.719
<i>Hmm.</i>

23:40.153 --> 23:41.487
Then, of course, there's your...

23:41.554 --> 23:43.890
Back. Aye.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.927
You're a hard man to kill, I think.

23:47.994 --> 23:49.662
Hmm.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.665
That brings me a great deal of comfort.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.736
Dare I ask why you're
bringing this up, though?

23:56.803 --> 23:58.938
<i>I was thinking about France.</i>

24:00.673 --> 24:03.709
A thing that happened to me.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.479
<i>There was an auld fortune teller</i>

24:06.546 --> 24:07.914
<i>reading palms.</i>

24:08.481 --> 24:10.550
<i>She grabbed my hand
and spat into my palm</i>

24:10.616 --> 24:12.084
<i>before I could object.</i>

24:13.219 --> 24:15.221
Bent so close,

24:15.488 --> 24:18.124
I could smell
the ancient sweat of her.

24:18.191 --> 24:21.227
<i>"T'es un chat, toi," she said.</i>

24:21.494 --> 24:23.896
- She said you were a cat?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

24:23.963 --> 24:26.699
I tried to pull away, but she held firm.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.535
Then she said, <i>"Neuf."</i>

24:31.037 --> 24:34.240
She said she saw the number nine
written in my hand...

24:35.141 --> 24:36.843
and also death.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.512
Do you think you have nine lives?

24:41.013 --> 24:42.715
I hope so.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.586
I never thought that hearing a litany

24:46.652 --> 24:50.056
of your near-death experiences
would bring me so much peace.

24:53.526 --> 24:56.495
Or maybe it's just
the nearness of you.

25:16.549 --> 25:17.817
<i>Claire.</i>

25:18.718 --> 25:20.119
Folk are coming.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.622
Is it Brown?

25:22.688 --> 25:25.625
No. Fisherfolk.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.800
Halt there!
I'm armed.

25:36.035 --> 25:38.537
Well, the whole world
kens ye're armed, Mr. Fraser.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.874
Hiram Crombie.
That's good.

25:41.941 --> 25:42.775
<i>Is it?</i>

25:42.842 --> 25:46.312
He hasn't exactly taken our side
in any of this.

25:46.579 --> 25:47.813
<i>Aye, it is good.</i>

25:47.880 --> 25:49.749
No matter what Hiram thinks of us,

25:49.815 --> 25:52.184
he willna allow Brown
to set the house alight

25:52.251 --> 25:54.020
or hang us
outside our very own home.

25:56.822 --> 25:59.225
We require you to come out, Mr. Fraser.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.594
And yer wife,

26:02.695 --> 26:04.297
<i>and anyone else that ye
have in there with ye.</i>

26:06.232 --> 26:09.335
Ye're suggestin' I descend
into the lion's den, are ye?

26:09.702 --> 26:12.104
I'm suggesting that we
canna have more bloodshed.

26:12.838 --> 26:15.074
<i>Mr. Brown has asked that I talk to ye,</i>

26:15.141 --> 26:17.276
<i>see if we canna negotiate the matter.</i>

26:22.248 --> 26:25.685
What assurance do I have
of our safety?

26:25.751 --> 26:28.254
I've placed myself
between you and these men.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.024
Now, that should be assurance enough.

26:34.327 --> 26:35.861
What do you think?

26:36.662 --> 26:38.264
It appears we're at a stalemate.

26:46.272 --> 26:49.942
Very well.
Know we remain armed.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.082
<i>Mr. Fraser, bring her out now</i>

26:56.148 --> 26:58.084
<i>to face justice!</i>

27:02.254 --> 27:04.223
- Burn the witch!
- Calm down, everyone!

27:04.290 --> 27:07.026
- Hiram!
- Mr. Fraser.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.261
<i>I'll tell you
what I told Mr. Brown.</i>

27:09.328 --> 27:11.330
Ye'll take my wife over my dead body.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.866
Thou shall not
suffer a witch to live!

27:13.933 --> 27:15.101
- <i>Witch!</i>
- <i>Witch!</i>

27:15.167 --> 27:16.635
Stop this! Be still!

27:16.702 --> 27:19.105
My wife is no witch,
nor is she a murderer.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.973
If she didna do it, who did?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.308
<i>If it wasna her,</i>

27:22.375 --> 27:24.176
<i>it was you, the</i> fear-siûrsachd!

27:26.112 --> 27:27.179
Justice!

27:27.246 --> 27:31.017
Justice for the murdered lass
and her innocent bairn unborn.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.853
I tried to save her and her child!

27:33.919 --> 27:35.755
Justice, justice!

27:35.821 --> 27:38.891
Justice is mine, sayeth the Lord.

27:38.958 --> 27:42.395
Then let justice have its day, Mr. Fraser.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.832
Now the committee

27:47.767 --> 27:50.036
want to take her to trial.

27:50.903 --> 27:54.240
Anyone accused is entitled
to that, are they not?

27:54.306 --> 27:55.408
Aye.

27:55.975 --> 27:59.345
And if she be innocent,
how can you refuse?

28:01.313 --> 28:04.083
That seems reasonable to me, Mr. Fraser.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.184
What say you?

28:08.387 --> 28:12.358
I say, if I surrender her
to the hands of this man,

28:12.425 --> 28:14.960
<i>she willna live to stand trial.</i>

28:15.027 --> 28:17.930
He blames me
for the death of his brother.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.066
<i>He would slaughter her out of hand</i>

28:20.132 --> 28:22.134
for sake of revenge upon me.

28:23.469 --> 28:24.437
Look at him.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.841
He has no more to do
with justice than with honor.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.911
You lay with a woman
that was not your wife,

28:31.977 --> 28:33.179
Mr. Fraser.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.947
Aye.

28:35.014 --> 28:39.819
If that be honor... then I concur.

28:39.885 --> 28:43.089
Take him!
Put him to a trial.

28:43.889 --> 28:46.425
It was him who debauched my sister...

28:48.327 --> 28:49.395
And killed her.

28:50.129 --> 28:51.997
<i>So I told you, Mr. Brown.</i>

28:52.064 --> 28:55.835
No, it is her.

28:57.336 --> 29:00.473
A man might kill a lass
he'd got wi' child,

29:00.739 --> 29:02.908
but no man would do such wickedness

29:02.975 --> 29:05.077
as steal a babe unborn from the womb.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.980
None but a witch would do that!

29:08.047 --> 29:10.049
Take them both, I say!

29:10.916 --> 29:14.186
Aye, you could.
Take them both, that is.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.057
Mr. Fraser, you'll go along

29:18.124 --> 29:19.992
<i>to see that nay harm comes to your wife.</i>

29:21.961 --> 29:24.396
And if it should be proven
that she is innocent--

29:24.463 --> 29:27.800
I am innocent, and so is he.

29:28.834 --> 29:30.236
Mistress Fraser!

29:30.302 --> 29:32.238
Jamie. They're here.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.917
We canna win, Claire.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.552
The men came, but it's not enough.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.921
'Twould be a fight to the death.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.257
We must go together.
I dinna see another way.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.096
<i>If you deliver us into this devil's hand,</i>

29:57.163 --> 29:59.999
<i>Mr. Crombie, then our blood
be upon your head.</i>

30:00.065 --> 30:02.568
Ye'll answer for our lives
on the Day of Judgment.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.572
<i>And I will answer for them now.</i>

30:17.316 --> 30:19.451
Let them both be taken, if you will.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.054
I will travel with them,

30:22.121 --> 30:24.924
as surety that no further evil
will be done.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.130
Surely justice is mine if it be anyone's.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.106
Aye.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.176
Thank the Lord.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.014
No, Mr. Fraser--

30:49.081 --> 30:50.149
Lizzie, bide.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.995
If it suits your convenience, Mr. Fraser,

31:03.062 --> 31:06.498
perhaps we will leave in the morning?

31:08.133 --> 31:10.202
<i>There's no reason you and your wife</i>

31:10.269 --> 31:12.504
should not rest in your own bed.

31:16.609 --> 31:18.377
I thank you, sir.

31:18.444 --> 31:19.645
Mm.

31:21.981 --> 31:25.884
I will set a guard to watch the house.

31:25.951 --> 31:27.419
As will I.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.956
We have a beautiful home.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.426
Aye.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.995
This will no' be the last time

32:43.062 --> 32:44.430
we see it by moonlight, Claire.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.601
I promise you wi' my life.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.402
I'm so scared.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.332
This here is Oakes.

36:07.933 --> 36:11.336
His task is to keep
an eagle eye on you.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.739
Leave the wagon, there'll be hell to pay.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.911
<i>Roll out!</i>

37:17.436 --> 37:19.504
Maybe I should tend
to their wounds.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.373
I have my travel kit with me.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.675
<i>Ye dinna owe them anythin'.</i>

37:23.742 --> 37:25.344
<i>I know.</i>

37:25.744 --> 37:27.646
<i>It won't exactly help matters for us</i>

37:27.713 --> 37:29.881
if one of them dies of infection.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.790
Allow me, Mistress Fraser.

37:49.735 --> 37:53.739
Eat, Sassenach.
It's kindly given.

38:12.424 --> 38:13.458
What news?

38:14.559 --> 38:17.596
None. We keep on.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.799
<i>Salisbury won't do for us.</i>

38:20.866 --> 38:22.668
<i>Sheriff there quit a week ago.</i>

38:22.734 --> 38:25.537
Circuit court's closed down also.

38:26.405 --> 38:29.608
<i>A matter of politics, so says the judge.</i>

38:30.942 --> 38:33.712
The whole town's split on
the question of independency.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.847
But it's nothin'
to do with independency.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.883
This is murder, for God's sake!

38:37.949 --> 38:39.584
You think he doesn't know that?

38:39.985 --> 38:42.487
<i>You heard the man.
There's no court.</i>

38:43.655 --> 38:47.793
We continue on to Wilmington.

38:47.859 --> 38:51.329
Wilmington?
That's 200 miles!

38:52.030 --> 38:53.799
Why not Cross Creek?

38:53.865 --> 38:57.436
Because his Aunt lives
near Cross Creek, you idiot.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.871
<i>Justice there's a friend of hers.</i>

38:59.938 --> 39:02.774
We'd never get a fair trial there.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.676
<i>Tomorrow we ride for Wilmington.</i>

39:05.877 --> 39:07.112
<i>That's that.</i>

39:14.486 --> 39:16.354
<i>Don't worry, Mr. Fraser.</i>

39:16.421 --> 39:19.124
Salisbury might not have a court,

39:20.058 --> 39:24.596
but I made sure the whole town
knew your wife was guilty.

39:24.663 --> 39:27.466
Word's spreadin' like wildfire now.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.679
Ian!

40:14.746 --> 40:16.148
They've taken them!

40:17.749 --> 40:18.750
Lizzie?

40:23.155 --> 40:24.556
What happened?

40:33.598 --> 40:35.667
Brown's losing control of his men.

40:36.468 --> 40:39.638
<i>They expected to hang us, loot our home.</i>

40:40.138 --> 40:41.139
Not this.

40:43.475 --> 40:44.676
They're as tired as we are.

40:45.177 --> 40:46.912
None as tired as Tom.

40:47.546 --> 40:51.183
<i>What do you suppose
his purpose is in all of this?</i>

40:51.449 --> 40:54.719
Is he really protecting us
only to see me hanged?

41:00.458 --> 41:01.893
Here they are, friends!

41:01.960 --> 41:05.831
Here's the depraved murderers
you've heard tell of,

41:06.498 --> 41:08.633
caught by your Committee of Safety.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.036
- <i>Murderers!</i>
- <i>Hang 'em!</i>

41:11.536 --> 41:13.004
There she is. Witch.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.740
Oh, rest assured,

41:15.807 --> 41:18.243
the end of this journey's
the end of a rope.

41:18.710 --> 41:19.845
<i>Murderers!</i>

41:19.911 --> 41:22.514
Murderers and sinners
are our stock in trade,

41:22.581 --> 41:23.982
good people.

41:24.049 --> 41:26.985
He plays the snake oil
salesman well enough.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.187
- Murderer!
- Ah!

41:29.254 --> 41:30.222
Claire!

41:31.590 --> 41:33.225
Stop this, all of you!

41:46.104 --> 41:47.672
This isn't justice!

41:52.911 --> 41:54.246
Stop it, now!

41:57.849 --> 42:00.986
Mr. Brown, get ahold of your men!

42:01.052 --> 42:03.588
Cease, all of you!

42:07.292 --> 42:08.560
Stand down!

42:09.160 --> 42:11.763
Christ. Are you hurt?

42:13.164 --> 42:15.066
<i>Calm yourselves!</i>

42:18.603 --> 42:20.305
<i>Ride out!</i>

42:36.888 --> 42:37.956
Whoa.

42:38.757 --> 42:39.824
Are we there yet?

42:41.293 --> 42:43.561
Jemmy's the one
who's supposed to say that.

42:43.628 --> 42:44.829
It is amazing.

42:44.896 --> 42:47.232
A day's drive in our time is weeks here.

42:47.299 --> 42:49.301
Well, have a look in the, um--

42:49.567 --> 42:51.036
under the kettle in the back.

42:51.970 --> 42:53.805
<i>Fergus sent it to me.</i>

42:54.806 --> 42:56.841
- "The New Bern Union."
- Look again.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.981
"The New Bern Onion."
Wait, wait, is this--

43:03.048 --> 43:04.683
Fergus' maiden effort.

43:04.749 --> 43:06.751
What? That's great.

43:06.818 --> 43:08.253
Wait, but why Onion?

43:08.320 --> 43:11.289
Well, he explains it in his
Remarks by the Proprietor.

43:11.356 --> 43:14.859
It's to do with onions
having layers, complexity,

43:14.926 --> 43:15.894
and...

43:16.728 --> 43:18.797
"A pungency and savor

43:18.863 --> 43:22.300
of the reasoned discourse
always to be exercised herein."

43:24.602 --> 43:25.937
Very French of him.

43:26.004 --> 43:28.773
Mm.
And there's a Poet's Corner.

43:29.274 --> 43:33.044
Fergus couldn't have done it.
He has no ear for rhyme at all.

43:33.111 --> 43:35.680
Was it Marsali, do you think?

43:35.747 --> 43:38.316
"On the Act Against
Retailing Spirituous Liquors."

43:38.383 --> 43:40.885
- I wanna talk to baby.
- Could be.

43:40.952 --> 43:44.222
Hi, baby.
I love you a lot.

43:46.358 --> 43:48.093
<i>Is your head itchy, honey?</i>

43:48.793 --> 43:50.362
Here. Let me have a look.

43:57.235 --> 44:00.805
He has lice.
How'd he get lice?

44:01.406 --> 44:04.075
Oh, it was going 'round
the fisherfolk's village

44:04.142 --> 44:05.243
about a week ago.

44:06.011 --> 44:08.847
And Jem plays with Aidan and Rabbie.

44:09.247 --> 44:10.782
Looks like you got 'em, too, mister.

44:10.849 --> 44:12.217
Huh.

44:13.251 --> 44:14.719
We're gonna have to cut your hair.

44:15.186 --> 44:16.421
Like Grandma?

44:16.688 --> 44:18.790
Even more than Grandma.

44:20.158 --> 44:23.395
Well, lucky for you,
kiddo, I brought my kit.

44:31.102 --> 44:32.704
Push, push!

44:32.771 --> 44:35.173
All right, there you go.

44:58.329 --> 45:01.066
<i>Barber, barber, shave a pig.</i>

45:01.132 --> 45:04.102
How many hairs to make a wig?

45:06.337 --> 45:08.039
Lots.

45:08.473 --> 45:10.341
And he had such beautiful hair.

45:10.408 --> 45:12.444
It'll grow back.

45:14.345 --> 45:16.981
All right. Done.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.283
Cleanup on aisle five.

45:25.423 --> 45:27.392
- What's that?
- Hmm?

45:32.964 --> 45:36.367
It's--it's just a mole, right?

45:39.804 --> 45:43.274
Aye, it's nothin'.
It's only a nevus.

45:43.341 --> 45:44.742
They're not dangerous.

45:45.743 --> 45:48.313
But where'd it come from?
He wasn't born with it.

45:48.780 --> 45:50.782
They don't develop until you're
two or three years old,

45:51.216 --> 45:52.784
<i>or older.</i>

45:52.851 --> 45:54.185
<i>A Doctor told me once.</i>

45:54.519 --> 45:56.988
I've had one just like it,
ever since I was a kid.

45:57.355 --> 45:58.990
Just here.

46:02.393 --> 46:03.862
They're hereditary.

46:10.835 --> 46:12.237
Roger.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.507
They're hereditary.

46:23.248 --> 46:26.484
I do believe I've picked up
a few lice myself.

46:27.819 --> 46:29.521
Like father, like son, aye?

46:33.124 --> 46:34.459
You'll give me a hand, will you?

46:51.109 --> 46:53.211
<i>When ye go to hit
someone, Sassenach...</i>

46:53.278 --> 46:55.313
Mm.

46:55.380 --> 46:57.248
Ye want to do it in the soft parts.

46:57.315 --> 46:59.918
<i>Too many bones in faces.</i>

46:59.984 --> 47:01.252
Then there's the teeth
to be thinking of.

47:02.020 --> 47:03.021
Ow.

47:03.087 --> 47:05.890
Well, thanks for your advice.

47:05.957 --> 47:08.226
How many times have you broken
your hand hitting someone?

47:08.293 --> 47:10.595
Your hand isn't broken, <i>a nighean.</i>

47:10.862 --> 47:13.064
How would you know?
I'm the Doctor here.

47:13.131 --> 47:15.266
If it were, ye'd be white and puking,

47:15.333 --> 47:17.068
not red-faced and crabbit.

47:17.135 --> 47:18.369
Oh, crabbit my arse.

47:21.906 --> 47:24.008
Fine, I'm crabby.

47:24.609 --> 47:26.544
We were just bloody stoned.

47:26.611 --> 47:29.948
Aye, the sight of ye, Sassenach,

47:31.049 --> 47:33.518
pounding on that wee lad
in a fit of fury.

47:33.585 --> 47:35.453
The look o' blood in yer eye.

47:36.221 --> 47:37.555
I'll treasure it.

47:39.891 --> 47:42.060
I'm glad I amuse you.

47:45.096 --> 47:47.298
<i>What is this place anyway?</i>

47:48.600 --> 47:50.335
'Tis a meat camp.

47:51.336 --> 47:56.174
Hunters from the lowlands
dress their game hereabouts

47:56.241 --> 47:57.342
<i>before returning back to their homes.</i>

47:59.010 --> 48:01.412
I daresay Brown regrets

48:01.479 --> 48:04.515
spreading gossip and hatred about us.

48:04.582 --> 48:06.084
<i>He may want to see us stoned to death,</i>

48:06.150 --> 48:07.652
<i>but I dinna think he intended</i>

48:07.919 --> 48:08.987
on being caught in the middle of it.

48:09.053 --> 48:10.922
Here. Let me have a look.

48:15.293 --> 48:16.661
How much farther to Wilmington?

48:20.331 --> 48:23.668
Ten days, mebbe less.

48:24.469 --> 48:26.004
Why?

48:26.070 --> 48:27.238
Ye got somewhere to be?

48:29.007 --> 48:30.441
Sleep now, <i>mo nighean donn.</i>

48:53.298 --> 48:54.932
Have a piss then.

49:02.674 --> 49:05.276
I don't suppose
you'll run without your wife.

49:05.343 --> 49:07.412
I'll give you a moment.

49:17.021 --> 49:18.156
Christ.

49:18.222 --> 49:19.991
Guardian angel, more like.

49:24.696 --> 49:26.464
We'll need a host of them, lad.

49:26.531 --> 49:29.434
I'm not alone.
Say the word, we'll come out.

49:29.500 --> 49:32.036
No, not yet.
But stay close.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.573
The Ridge?
All is well?

49:35.640 --> 49:38.176
Idle talk. Rumors.

49:38.242 --> 49:40.178
Aye, there would be.

49:40.244 --> 49:42.146
<i>I heard about the stoning.</i>

49:42.213 --> 49:45.450
Aye, Brown's been
spreadin' the story as we go.

49:45.516 --> 49:47.418
Ye wouldna countenance
some of the things I've heard,

49:47.485 --> 49:49.020
followin' in yer tracks.

49:52.457 --> 49:53.624
<i>There's cover
in the nearby hills.</i>

49:53.691 --> 49:55.727
Could be safe, hidden by dawn.

49:55.993 --> 49:57.161
<i>It wouldna do.</i>

49:57.228 --> 50:00.365
<i>Wi' folks roused against us,
they do Brown's work for him.</i>

50:00.431 --> 50:02.633
<i>To run would be an admission of guilt.</i>

50:02.700 --> 50:04.369
Fugitives wi' a price on our heads.

50:04.435 --> 50:07.004
I'll bide and watch.

50:08.473 --> 50:10.074
God go wi' ye, lad.

50:10.141 --> 50:12.009
And with you, Uncle.

50:40.671 --> 50:42.306
What's going on?

50:43.107 --> 50:44.675
<i>Brown went away
in the early hours.</i>

50:44.742 --> 50:46.310
<i>Came back wi' a friend.</i>

50:47.178 --> 50:48.379
Well, who is he?

50:49.514 --> 50:51.115
I dinna ken.

51:19.210 --> 51:21.345
Ezra! Halt, halt!

51:31.456 --> 51:32.557
Dead as a doornail.

51:35.660 --> 51:38.529
He's a friend.
I know his family.

51:39.697 --> 51:42.200
I should take him home, see him buried.

51:42.266 --> 51:44.335
Let the dead bury the dead.

51:45.236 --> 51:46.404
Tie him across his horse.

51:51.442 --> 51:52.777
We ride on!

52:15.833 --> 52:17.435
Get out.
Get yourselves a drink.

52:23.674 --> 52:26.777
You stay there.
We won't be long.

52:28.479 --> 52:29.514
<i>Hurry up.</i>

52:49.800 --> 52:52.169
Jamie! No!

52:52.236 --> 52:54.605
Let go of me! Jamie!

52:56.340 --> 52:57.875
Claire!

52:57.942 --> 53:01.812
No! Jamie!

53:01.879 --> 53:03.781
Claire!

53:12.356 --> 53:13.958
- Let go of me!
- Halt!

53:16.928 --> 53:19.830
What are you doing?
Where are you taking Jamie?

53:19.897 --> 53:21.866
That's none of your concern.

53:21.933 --> 53:25.336
You bastard!
You petty bastard!

53:25.403 --> 53:26.871
I know you think I'm doing this

53:26.938 --> 53:29.840
'cause of what happened
to my brother, but I'm not.

53:30.608 --> 53:32.476
My brother was a lout.

53:33.611 --> 53:35.846
What he and them other men did to ye

53:36.581 --> 53:38.616
<i>was cruel and unforgiveable.</i>

53:40.751 --> 53:43.421
But you committed murder,
Mistress Fraser.

53:44.488 --> 53:47.992
<i>An innocent young girl
and her unborn child.</i>

53:48.259 --> 53:50.528
I need no other cause.

53:56.267 --> 53:57.802
But then again,

53:58.502 --> 54:00.237
he was my brother.

54:01.606 --> 54:03.774
Tom! Tom!

54:03.841 --> 54:06.477
You have to go back!
They're going to kill him!

54:06.544 --> 54:08.346
What's the meaning of this?

54:08.412 --> 54:10.715
You swore not to hurt them
on my account.

54:11.449 --> 54:13.718
<i>Oh, I'm not hurtin' no one.</i>

54:13.784 --> 54:15.953
Mister Fraser's merely being, uh...

54:18.356 --> 54:19.690
...merely being sent home.

54:19.757 --> 54:20.825
A word with you, sir.

54:39.510 --> 54:41.379
They will not kill nor harm him.

54:42.346 --> 54:44.448
Mr. Brown's word of honor, he says.

54:44.515 --> 54:46.584
And you believe him?

54:46.651 --> 54:48.919
No, you have to go back.

54:48.986 --> 54:51.589
I've sworn to protect you,
Mistress Fraser.

54:51.656 --> 54:53.658
I know your husband.

54:53.724 --> 54:55.493
He can look after himself.

54:55.559 --> 54:57.028
Mr. Christie--

54:57.294 --> 54:58.996
<i>To go back would mean
letting you out of my sight.</i>

55:00.731 --> 55:01.932
And that I cannot do.

55:07.738 --> 55:08.973
<i>Ride on!</i>

55:17.615 --> 55:19.450
<i>He was right, of course.</i>

55:20.084 --> 55:22.853
<i>Without Tom, I was as good as dead.</i>

55:24.522 --> 55:26.757
<i>As it was, the journey to Wilmington</i>

55:26.824 --> 55:29.694
<i>passed in a blur
of fear and discomfort.</i>

55:30.461 --> 55:32.463
<i>My one small hope was this.</i>

55:33.064 --> 55:35.599
<i>If news of my arrest
had reached Wilmington</i>

55:35.666 --> 55:37.668
<i>ahead of me,
then maybe it would reach</i>

55:37.735 --> 55:39.937
<i>Roger and Brianna in Edenton as well.</i>

55:42.807 --> 55:45.576
<i>While I wondered
what was to happen to me,</i>

55:46.610 --> 55:49.447
<i>my constant thought was for Jamie.</i>

55:50.448 --> 55:51.749
<i>Tom Christie was plainly</i>

55:51.816 --> 55:54.452
<i>my only hope of learning anything,</i>

55:54.518 --> 55:57.054
<i>but he avoided my eyes
and kept his distance,</i>

55:57.121 --> 55:59.690
<i>and I found that as alarming
as anything else.</i>

56:00.357 --> 56:01.959
<i>He was clearly troubled.</i>

56:02.727 --> 56:05.529
<i>I was terribly afraid
that he knew or suspected</i>

56:05.596 --> 56:08.733
<i>that Jamie was dead
but would not admit it,</i>

56:08.799 --> 56:11.869
<i>either to me or to himself.</i>

57:17.535 --> 57:19.537
Your accommodations, Mistress Fraser.

57:41.025 --> 57:42.960
You missed supper.

57:43.027 --> 57:45.529
But there's always tomorrow.

58:01.679 --> 58:04.481
Sheriff. A word with you.

58:13.224 --> 58:15.893
Here.
For your maintenance.

58:15.960 --> 58:17.161
Tom--

58:17.228 --> 58:19.864
Believe me, your husband is alive.

58:19.930 --> 58:24.034
I would not have his death
on my conscious, nor yours.

58:24.101 --> 58:26.770
- But where--
- Trust in God.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.274
He will deliver the righteous
out of danger.

58:31.175 --> 58:33.143
You think I'm righteous?

58:33.210 --> 58:36.580
I will not leave town, Mistress Fraser.

58:37.514 --> 58:38.816
You may trust that too.

58:47.157 --> 58:50.227
I'll see you at the gallows,
Mistress Fraser.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.582
Where's my wife?

59:12.583 --> 59:14.251
What have you done with her?

59:14.318 --> 59:15.920
<i>I ain't done nothin', Mr. Fraser.</i>

59:17.321 --> 59:21.125
Though what Mr. Brown may have done, well,

59:21.191 --> 59:23.160
it's not my place to say.

59:26.931 --> 59:29.233
All the trouble that bitch put us through,

59:29.300 --> 59:31.635
<i>and killing my friend Ezra...</i>

59:32.636 --> 59:34.004
I hope she dies.

59:36.974 --> 59:38.575
Oh!

59:43.013 --> 59:44.848
You're goin' aboard that ship.

59:46.951 --> 59:49.119
And then that ship's
taking you home to Scotland,

59:49.186 --> 59:50.354
where you belong.

59:50.621 --> 59:52.923
We depart for Edinburgh
within the hour.

59:54.692 --> 59:57.027
<i>You'll never see
your witch of a wife again.</i>

59:59.830 --> 1:00:01.999
I trust you have
my money, Mr. Oakes.

1:00:02.066 --> 1:00:03.233
Mr. Brown suggested--

1:00:48.679 --> 1:00:49.947
I wouldn't do that, friend.

1:00:54.385 --> 1:00:57.154
Don't! He kens where Claire is.

1:00:59.957 --> 1:01:01.191
So do we, Uncle.

1:01:04.428 --> 1:01:05.295
No!

1:01:17.307 --> 1:01:19.343
I told you I would fight
with you, Bear Killer.
