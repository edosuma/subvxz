00:28.061 --> 00:30.256
All you bad apples,
welcome to Sage City.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.628
Big Ed, I say we fire up
this baby right now...

00:32.698 --> 00:34.792
and grind those apples
into sauce.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.495
Look, if you wanna find out
about Big Ed...

00:36.569 --> 00:38.867
why don't you just take a
little peek inside of his safe?

00:38.938 --> 00:43.671
That all of my equity is in my
livestock. No livestock, no equity.

00:43.743 --> 00:47.372
Rebecca Hammond lost 20 calves
to rustlers this morning.

00:47.447 --> 00:49.745
He's onto us, Alfred.

00:49.816 --> 00:50.976
Am I seeing double?

01:05.265 --> 01:07.597
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

01:07.667 --> 01:10.295
into the dangerous world
of a man...

01:10.370 --> 01:12.565
who does not exist.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.045
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:22.115 --> 01:24.709
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:24.784 --> 01:27.116
the helpless, the powerless...

01:27.187 --> 01:30.054
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:57.810 --> 03:01.439
How much farther to Sage City?
This is Sage City.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.074
As for the Right-On-Ranch...

03:06.586 --> 03:10.852
it's exactly 3.5 miles.
3.5 miles. Good.

03:11.257 --> 03:14.749
Maybe we'll be in time for
a little country breakfast.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.921
Bet the comforts of home...

03:18.998 --> 03:21.262
would feel mighty good
to you about now.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.370
Soft, perfumed sheets...

03:24.771 --> 03:28.571
breakfast in bed,
a nice hot bubble bath.

03:28.641 --> 03:32.133
How does that sound? Like
you've never been to the Bronx.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.773
No. Can't say that I have.
Cat, listen.

03:40.453 --> 03:43.183
Just the cactus
sucking wind.

03:43.823 --> 03:46.155
Cat, there's somebody
out there. I know it.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.921
Come on, let's go.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.490
Come on, get in. Let's go.

04:33.906 --> 04:37.899
I'm not going to lose this ranch,
Cat. I've got too many plans for it.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.002
You get off this land,
you cactus sucking...

04:45.985 --> 04:48.613
KITT, did you hear those shots?
I'm afraid I did, Michael.

04:48.688 --> 04:50.155
All right,
find out where they came from.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.095
Michael,
those shots are coming...

04:57.163 --> 04:59.222
from the Right-On-Ranch.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.804
Hey, they're getting away!
Not if I can help it.

05:08.875 --> 05:12.709
KITT, we're in scanning range.
Give me a hard copy, will you?

05:12.979 --> 05:16.642
Looks like rustlers, pal.
Welcome to the wild, wild west.

05:16.716 --> 05:17.944
Let's go get them, pal.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.813
Jump, Cat, jump! You don't
have to tell me twice!

05:42.742 --> 05:46.200
What kind of truck is that?
A real big one, KITT.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.907
Michael, there's a young woman
up ahead.

05:48.981 --> 05:53.247
Judging by the way she's thrashing
about, I don't think she can swim.

06:09.435 --> 06:11.198
Come on. I got you.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.274
You okay?

06:21.647 --> 06:26.607
Oh, yeah, sure. I just lost
another 20 head of cattle.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.244
My pick-up looks like it went
through a giant can crusher...

06:29.322 --> 06:32.621
and this just happens to be a new
outfit and a new pair of boots.

06:32.692 --> 06:35.160
Why shouldn't I be okay?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.957
Who are you anyway?

06:37.497 --> 06:38.896
You're welcome.

06:38.965 --> 06:42.025
Name's Michael Knight.
I'm from the Foundation.

06:43.436 --> 06:45.427
Where are all the others?

06:46.606 --> 06:48.130
What others?

06:48.708 --> 06:52.542
For all the trouble I had convincing
Devon Miles that I needed help...

06:52.612 --> 06:57.208
I thought he'd send an army or at
least a bunch of reformed muggers.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.683
Well, I'm sorry, but what
you see is what you get.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.653
And what you saw is only part
of what you're up against.

07:02.722 --> 07:07.250
There's also some cowboys,
truckers, snakes of all persuasions.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.792
Any idea who they are?

07:10.062 --> 07:11.927
Yeah. The bad guys.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.099
The bad guys.

07:15.001 --> 07:19.199
Can you give us a lift back
to the ranch? Yeah, sure.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.569
I want to check out
the Sheriff.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.473
There is a sheriff
in this town, isn't there?

07:24.177 --> 07:25.269
Yeah.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.335
Lots of luck.

07:30.082 --> 07:32.482
Don't you dare.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.753
Keeping an eye on you.

07:46.732 --> 07:48.791
No word for love

07:50.436 --> 07:53.166
Well, looks like
the hoosegow's over there.

07:53.239 --> 07:56.470
Hoosegow? Is that something
like "moo cow"?

07:57.577 --> 08:01.911
No, it's not something like moo
cow. It's western for jail, buddy.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.144
Don't tell me, they even have
their own language?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.253
It appears
there's no one home.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.415
KITT, where's
the Shaggy Buffalo?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.891
Right across the street,
Michael.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.127
If you leave me tonight

08:17.196 --> 08:18.993
I will cry

08:19.532 --> 08:24.435
Though you say
we will both meet again

08:24.670 --> 08:26.501
Words like love

08:26.572 --> 08:30.508
And truth and goodness

08:31.477 --> 08:36.244
Words like
till death us do part

08:36.916 --> 08:41.376
I will never love another

08:41.453 --> 08:44.787
Take my heart,
take my heart

08:44.891 --> 08:47.359
Take my heart

08:47.927 --> 08:51.226
It's taken. Very nice.

08:51.297 --> 08:53.527
At least someone around here
has an ear for good music.

08:53.599 --> 08:56.295
It's not the song,
sweetheart. It's the singer.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.837
My name's Marilyn,
like in Monroe.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.971
My name's Michael,
like in Knight.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.411
Showtime is over,
Miss Marilyn.

09:07.780 --> 09:11.682
Time to get your apron from your
room, and do some honest work.

09:13.185 --> 09:16.746
Hope to see you again, Michael.
It would be my pleasure.

09:18.424 --> 09:22.087
Can I buy you a drink, stranger? No,
thank you. I'm looking for the Sheriff.

09:22.161 --> 09:26.962
Well, you don't have to look far.
Little brother, someone here to see you.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.398
Seen him enough?
It's about Rebecca Hammond.

09:36.475 --> 09:39.308
She lost another 20 calves
to rustlers this morning.

09:39.378 --> 09:40.709
Rustlers?

09:40.780 --> 09:44.181
You've been watching too many
late-night movies, boy.

09:45.618 --> 09:47.745
Then what do you call this?

09:52.992 --> 09:56.894
I call that a truck, taking
a bunch of calves to market.

09:56.963 --> 10:00.160
Yeah, except they're someone
else's calves. Says who?

10:00.232 --> 10:02.757
Says Rebecca Hammond.
Her brand's on them.

10:02.835 --> 10:06.498
Well, let me tell you something
about Rebecca Hammond, boy.

10:06.572 --> 10:11.066
She's a rancher about like
Marilyn over there is a singer.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.472
She don't care nothing
about cattle.

10:13.546 --> 10:17.175
She only bought that spread so
she'd have a place for her kids.

10:17.249 --> 10:18.807
What kids?

10:19.352 --> 10:23.311
A bunch of bad apples she picked
up off the streets of New York City.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.152
And now she wants to
bring them out here...

10:25.224 --> 10:28.523
so's they can terrorize our
decent, law-abiding citizens.

10:28.794 --> 10:29.988
I'll tell you one thing.

10:30.062 --> 10:33.259
The only one going to be doing
any terrorizing around here is me.

10:33.332 --> 10:36.460
Will you put
that thing away, Lance?

10:37.536 --> 10:40.027
You a friend of Miss Hammond's? Yeah.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.370
Well, then,
maybe she'll listen to you.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.103
I happen to know the
Unified Ranch Corporation...

10:45.177 --> 10:47.737
has made her an offer
on her place.

10:48.014 --> 10:50.505
A very fair
and reasonable offer.

10:51.484 --> 10:55.045
And if you're really her friend,
boy, you'll see that she accepts it.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.715
You got that?
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

10:57.790 --> 11:02.557
Now, why don't you tell the Sheriff to
get off his brains and get the rustlers?

11:12.905 --> 11:14.736
Get me Devon, will you, pal?

11:16.208 --> 11:17.505
Well, Devon...

11:17.576 --> 11:19.703
I think there's something
you failed to tell me.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.906
Really, Michael?
And what is that?

11:21.981 --> 11:26.145
That is Rebecca Hammond's real reason
for buying the ranch in the first place.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.845
Oh, I take it
you mean the children.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.595
Michael,
what on earth is that?

11:37.963 --> 11:40.488
Something tells me,
the bad apples.

11:40.666 --> 11:44.500
They've arrived. Well,
Michael, I won't keep you.

11:44.570 --> 11:47.835
Just remember, children
are the flowers of mankind.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.841
Death.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.708
Flowers?

11:56.148 --> 11:57.172
Hmm.

11:57.249 --> 11:59.183
I'll keep that in mind.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.981
Bizarre.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.955
Be careful, Michael,
there's just the two of us.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.720
Yeah.
A mean scene.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.853
Miss Hammond,
I think it's them.

12:13.799 --> 12:16.290
Man, what did I do
to deserve this?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.765
Two steps down, Joanna.
Hi, you guys.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.670
Welcome.
I'm glad you finally got here.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.538
Joanna, I've missed you,
you sweetheart.

12:23.609 --> 12:26.442
All you bad apples,
welcome to Sage City.

12:33.119 --> 12:34.450
All right...

12:35.354 --> 12:37.686
what did you do
with the driver?

12:38.724 --> 12:39.952
He quit.

12:40.559 --> 12:41.787
He quit?

12:46.532 --> 12:49.467
When?
After the breakdown.

12:49.535 --> 12:52.436
The bus broke down?
No, the driver.

12:52.505 --> 12:55.997
Forty-five minutes out
of New York City. No guts.

12:56.642 --> 12:57.700
Who drove?

12:57.777 --> 13:00.644
What difference does it make?
We got here, didn't we?

13:00.713 --> 13:01.941
He's got a point.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.150
Whose side are you on?

13:05.684 --> 13:09.279
All right, all right. Back on
the bus. Let's go to the ranch.

13:09.355 --> 13:12.017
You mean,
this ain't the ranch?

13:12.525 --> 13:15.426
Miss Hammond.
Did you get everything, Blue?

13:15.494 --> 13:17.860
Yes, ma'am. Even
the Coney Island hot dogs.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.397
Cat, you get to
drive the bus.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.298
Come on, Joanna,
you go with me and Blue.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.696
Hey, come on.
We've got ways to go here.

13:29.475 --> 13:33.343
I'll meet you out there. We've
got a few things to talk about.

13:38.017 --> 13:41.453
Well, I think it's time we sashayed
down to the old homestead, partner.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.318
I think I liked you better
when you spoke rock 'n' roll.

13:52.264 --> 13:55.597
Time is running out.
Maybe there's another way.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.228
You do anything
you have to, Alfred.

14:00.406 --> 14:03.569
And if that long drink of water
gives you any trouble at all...

14:03.642 --> 14:05.735
you just let me
handle him.

14:23.596 --> 14:26.463
So, you're a rancher, or a mother
hen to a bunch of bad apples?

14:26.532 --> 14:29.262
Which is it?
Both.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.269
And they're not
bad apples, really.

14:31.337 --> 14:33.931
They just haven't fallen
far enough from the tree.

14:34.006 --> 14:38.340
They've been battered and abused and
used and left to fend for themselves.

14:38.410 --> 14:41.038
Even Joanna?
Especially Joanna.

14:41.113 --> 14:45.413
She's been blind since birth, kicked around
more times than an Italian soccer ball.

14:45.484 --> 14:49.011
If you haven't guessed already, Michael,
my real occupation isn't ranching.

14:49.088 --> 14:52.524
I'm a child psychologist.
I kind of got that feeling.

14:52.591 --> 14:55.458
By the way I handle the kids?
No.

14:55.527 --> 14:59.793
By the way you tried to milk that
cow which turned out to be a bull.

15:05.971 --> 15:09.737
Seriously, Rebecca, I do admire
the way you handle the kids.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.170
Thanks.

15:12.678 --> 15:15.306
Anyway, I came to the conclusion
that all the testing...

15:15.381 --> 15:17.849
and counseling, and
understanding in the world...

15:17.917 --> 15:20.317
didn't mean a thing if after
those kids left my office...

15:20.386 --> 15:22.286
they just went back
to the streets.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.720
So you bought
the Right-On-Ranch.

15:26.191 --> 15:30.025
With my savings and every penny
I could beg, borrow, or steal.

15:30.129 --> 15:32.927
See, I figured if I could bring
a bunch of them out here with me...

15:32.998 --> 15:34.329
for maybe a year...

15:34.400 --> 15:37.858
let them work the place, share
in the profits, if there are any.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.634
Or even give them a
second chance? Right.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.407
But this is my first group...

15:44.476 --> 15:47.639
and if I lose any more cattle,
it may be my last.

15:48.881 --> 15:52.339
Cat and Blue are the only
hands I've been able to hire.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.014
So I need some help, Michael.

15:55.087 --> 15:59.990
Rebecca, that's what I'm here
for. I'm behind you all the way.

16:02.861 --> 16:04.920
Yo,
that's one bad car, man.

16:04.997 --> 16:09.195
Hey, man, there's not a car made Diablo
can't rip off or chop up any day of the week.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.702
I guess, Monday's
not a day of the week.

16:11.770 --> 16:14.568
Oh, wow. Bizarre!

16:14.640 --> 16:18.474
Oh, man. What a freak-a-zoid.
Now I'm getting mad.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.705
Don't get mad, friend, get in.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.149
Well?

16:32.224 --> 16:36.422
Hey, dude, I'm from 125th
Street. I don't impress easy.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.963
Oh, really? Well,
we'll see about that.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.074
Killer wheels, man.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.774
A real punk-out.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.779
What's the 125th Street kid
have to say now?

17:07.659 --> 17:10.457
Don't touch the eject button.
Hey, come on, dude.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.175
Impressive.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.719
Unified Ranch Corporation,
what do you know about them?

18:08.787 --> 18:09.879
Nothing, really.

18:09.955 --> 18:12.856
Except that they're buying up a
lot of the ranches around here.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.416
Who's behind them?
I don't know.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.079
Don't cry.

18:37.983 --> 18:39.280
I'm here.

18:40.752 --> 18:43.016
Everything's going
to be all right.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.418
Is anyone there?

18:51.263 --> 18:53.163
Is there someone there?

18:59.438 --> 19:02.430
You just be real quiet
and I won't hurt you.

19:07.713 --> 19:10.181
That's Joanna. It sounds like
it's coming from the barn.

19:10.249 --> 19:13.082
KITT, meet me at the barn.
On my way, Michael.

19:49.321 --> 19:52.085
Joanna, it's okay.
It's me, Michael.

19:52.157 --> 19:54.057
KITT, run some
interference for me.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.855
Right away, Michael.

20:09.908 --> 20:12.172
Man, you just knocked
my socks off.

20:12.244 --> 20:15.372
Yes, well, put them back on.
It gets cold here at night.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.318
You're okay, Joanna?
I found this in the barn.

20:21.253 --> 20:22.618
Excuse me.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.495
Hey, partner,
how about the ingredients?

20:34.900 --> 20:39.200
Two parts C21, H22, N2O2...

20:39.338 --> 20:41.499
and one part S2O4.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.438
Doesn't sound like the recipe
to Mom's apple pie, does it?

20:45.510 --> 20:48.911
It's a deadly poisonous alkaloid,
Michael. Mixed in with the feed...

20:48.981 --> 20:52.178
it's enough to destroy at
least a thousand head of cattle.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.011
Poison?
Yeah, you heard me.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.522
And it was found
in Rebecca Hammond's barn.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.820
Now this goes
beyond rustling.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.195
I want something done
about this.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.958
In her barn, you say?

21:06.031 --> 21:08.625
She ought to be more careful
than that.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.195
Here, I'll just take that
for evidence.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.535
You take it,
you take it the hard way.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.340
You listen here.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.638
I'm the Sheriff...

21:19.711 --> 21:23.977
and if I say I want that for evidence,
then I'll take it for evidence.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.911
Ain't that right, Big Ed?
Tell me...

21:27.119 --> 21:29.587
are you a betting man,
Mr. Knight?

21:31.189 --> 21:33.953
Yeah. You see that
bucking bronco over there?

21:34.026 --> 21:37.484
Oh, that thing. I thought that
went out with the hula hoop.

21:37.863 --> 21:41.390
I'll bet that Lance can stay
on that longer than you.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.561
And if he doesn't?

21:46.638 --> 21:48.697
Then you walk out of here
with the evidence.

21:48.774 --> 21:51.709
Of course, you can always
walk out of here right now...

21:51.777 --> 21:53.142
without it.

21:54.513 --> 21:55.605
Well?

22:02.487 --> 22:04.284
Let's go for a ride.

22:04.856 --> 22:08.758
Guests first. Brother Alfred
will do the honors.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.025
Hang on to this for me,
will you?

22:15.100 --> 22:17.330
Michael, be careful.

22:17.402 --> 22:20.667
I've seen real live cowboys
break their back on that bronco.

22:20.872 --> 22:23.773
Real cowboys?
Rodeo champs.

22:24.042 --> 22:25.407
Rodeo champs?

22:25.477 --> 22:28.207
Snapped right in two.
In two?

22:29.114 --> 22:31.582
Thanks for
the vote of confidence.

22:38.623 --> 22:40.250
Ride it, cowboy.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.358
Come on, Michael.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.787
You okay?
Piece of cake.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.831
Twenty seconds.
Twenty seconds?

23:21.900 --> 23:23.424
That's right.

23:32.611 --> 23:34.977
Let her rip.
Ride it, Lance.

23:35.046 --> 23:36.638
Ride it, baby.

23:51.296 --> 23:53.230
Who are they kidding?

23:53.298 --> 23:56.392
He's got more of a chance of
falling asleep than falling off.

23:56.468 --> 23:57.867
Ten seconds.

23:58.403 --> 24:00.701
Ten seconds,
and still dancing.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.799
Hey, partner, there's a bronco in here
that needs a little bit more juice.

24:04.876 --> 24:06.468
Coming right up.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.589
More juice, KITT.

24:43.014 --> 24:45.005
Nineteen seconds.
Nineteen seconds.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.607
My champion.

24:51.723 --> 24:54.624
Just call me
Bronco Knight.

24:55.927 --> 24:57.451
Thanks, buddy.

25:05.103 --> 25:07.469
Big Ed.
Yeah?

25:11.843 --> 25:15.176
I think I figured out another
way to get rid of Rebecca Hammond.

25:15.247 --> 25:19.343
Once and for all.
Good idea, brother Alfred.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.043
Meantime...

25:22.120 --> 25:24.680
I got some house cleaning
of my own.

25:26.825 --> 25:29.089
Michael, why do I
get the feeling that...

25:29.160 --> 25:32.095
Home On The Range wasn't
written with us in mind?

25:32.364 --> 25:33.661
I hear you, pal.

25:33.732 --> 25:37.099
And if I ever catch you in Sage City
again, you'll be singing up on Boot Hill.

25:37.168 --> 25:39.500
Maybe we've got
someone else on our side.

25:39.571 --> 25:43.268
Yeah? Well, for your information,
Sage City is Boot Hill.

25:49.581 --> 25:50.912
Marilyn.

25:53.418 --> 25:54.715
There's a bus
pulling out of here...

25:54.786 --> 25:58.586
in 10 minutes, and I'm going to be
on it. You won't miss it, I promise.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.987
Well?

26:02.060 --> 26:04.528
Tell me what you know
about Big Ed Barton?

26:04.963 --> 26:06.863
He's a rat. What more
do you want to know?

26:06.932 --> 26:10.959
Why is this rat so anxious to
move Rebecca Hammond off her ranch?

26:11.603 --> 26:14.265
I'm not sure, but I think it has
something to do with those kids.

26:14.339 --> 26:15.931
Yeah, well, I don't.

26:16.007 --> 26:19.841
Have you heard anything about
this Unified Ranch Corporation?

26:19.911 --> 26:22.744
Yeah, I think I heard Big Ed and
his brothers talking about it once.

26:22.814 --> 26:25.749
Do you remember anything they said? No.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.751
But, look, if you want to
find out about Big Ed...

26:27.819 --> 26:30.049
why don't you just take a
little peek inside of his safe?

26:30.121 --> 26:32.612
Safe? In his office behind the saloon.

26:32.691 --> 26:35.091
Being a crook himself, Big Ed
doesn't trust the banks.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.856
He keeps his entire life
locked inside that safe.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.829
Okay. Thanks.

26:42.901 --> 26:45.495
Well, I got a bus to catch.
Yeah.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.462
You... You know where to?

26:48.540 --> 26:50.804
Yeah. Wherever it's going.

26:53.712 --> 26:56.510
See you around, Michael,
as in Knight.

26:56.581 --> 26:59.573
Take care, Marilyn,
as in Monroe.

27:23.074 --> 27:26.066
All right, KITT. We've got to
get in Big Ed Barton's safe.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.873
In broad daylight?

27:27.946 --> 27:30.881
Michael, even the most
desperate desperado...

27:31.449 --> 27:33.178
Is something wrong?

27:33.418 --> 27:37.445
There's a puddle on the ground
where the bus was parked.

27:37.789 --> 27:39.780
What do you make of that?

27:40.892 --> 27:42.757
Michael, it's brake fluid.

27:42.827 --> 27:45.625
And I also detect some
steel filings on the ground.

27:45.697 --> 27:48.632
Oh, no.
The brake lines are cut.

28:09.254 --> 28:13.213
All right, you bad apples. Let's
keep it down to a small roar, okay?

28:13.291 --> 28:15.589
Okay.
All right.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.616
All right, you guys. Get down.

28:43.855 --> 28:45.083
Now!

29:02.874 --> 29:06.435
Michael, we're close enough for
me to microlock the wheel system.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.035
It's too risky, pal.
Once we jam her...

29:08.113 --> 29:10.604
she won't have enough strength
to keep the bus under control.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.513
Pull up close to her bumper.

29:13.151 --> 29:15.085
Michael,
what are you going to do?

29:15.153 --> 29:17.348
All right. Take over, pal.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.357
I got it. Go!

30:02.634 --> 30:05.228
All right, KITT, give me
all the microlock you've got.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.668
Right away.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.949
Everybody okay? You okay?
Yeah, all right.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.989
All right, stay cool.
I'll have KITT tow you back.

30:25.056 --> 30:29.015
I don't understand it. I just
had the bus safety checked.

30:29.093 --> 30:31.857
Don't worry. It wasn't
a mechanical failure.

30:31.930 --> 30:34.160
Somebody cut the brake lines.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.637
Big Ed, I say we fire up
this baby right now...

30:44.709 --> 30:47.303
and grind those apples
into sauce.

30:47.378 --> 30:51.314
Not with that guy Knight around. He's
more trouble than a Texas twister.

30:51.382 --> 30:54.647
We're gonna be safer sticking
with our original plan.

30:54.719 --> 30:56.084
There we were...

30:56.154 --> 31:01.091
on the trail of one of the meanest
outlaws this side of the Rio Grande.

31:01.159 --> 31:02.353
"We"?

31:02.427 --> 31:06.386
Well, actually,
I was by myself at the time.

31:07.665 --> 31:10.657
You familiar with
Billy the Kid?

31:10.735 --> 31:12.066
Let's see.

31:13.104 --> 31:17.165
Billy the Kid. Real name.
William Bonney, Born. 1860.

31:17.308 --> 31:19.401
Died. July 13th, 1881.

31:22.947 --> 31:25.575
I'm talking about
a different Billy the Kid.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.982
Mine spelt his with two D's.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.850
I'm sorry.
You should be.

31:30.922 --> 31:34.653
Besides, I ain't got time to
stand around talking to no car.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.018
I got dogies to round up.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.832
Sure I can't change
your mind, Blue?

31:41.900 --> 31:42.958
I'm sorry, ma'am...

31:43.034 --> 31:46.663
but ever since I started working for you,
the guys in town are not talking to me...

31:46.738 --> 31:49.298
and the gals just ain't
smiling the way they used to.

31:49.374 --> 31:52.571
I don't mind the guys
not talking. I understand.

31:52.644 --> 31:56.341
I did fix your brakes for you, though,
and mended the fence on the south pasture.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.644
Thank you, Blue. That's nice.

32:07.125 --> 32:10.891
Hey. I got some good news.
I can use some.

32:10.962 --> 32:13.863
Reinforcements are on the way.
Devon's coming.

32:13.932 --> 32:18.164
Devon's coming?
That's it? Devon's coming?

32:18.503 --> 32:19.492
Oh, God.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.136
We barely escape death because
somebody cut the brake line.

32:24.208 --> 32:26.676
My one able-bodied hand quits.

32:26.744 --> 32:29.975
The bank is going to foreclose on my
mortgage if I lose any more cattle...

32:30.048 --> 32:33.313
and you tell me Devon's
coming. Wait a minute.

32:33.618 --> 32:37.611
What's this about the bank? Why
didn't you tell me about that?

32:37.689 --> 32:41.853
I just found out in town, that all
of my equity is in my livestock.

32:42.193 --> 32:44.161
No livestock, no equity.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.657
No equity, no Right-On-Ranch.

32:47.732 --> 32:50.166
You know what else
they told me?

32:50.368 --> 32:54.862
They told me that I should accept the
Unified Ranch Corporation's offer...

32:55.573 --> 32:56.835
and sell.

32:59.577 --> 33:02.740
Well, did you give them
both barrels or just one?

33:03.648 --> 33:06.173
I told them that
I'd think about it.

33:08.286 --> 33:10.982
Don't look at me that way,
Michael.

33:14.158 --> 33:16.991
Maybe it's just not worth
any more fight.

33:19.764 --> 33:22.631
If I really thought you
believed that, I'd say okay.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.565
It's your ranch.
It's your dream.

33:24.635 --> 33:27.103
Hold up the white flag,
surrender the fort.

33:27.171 --> 33:31.403
But come on, that's not you
and that's not me.

33:32.343 --> 33:36.006
We've got them whipped, boss.
They just don't know it yet.

33:41.419 --> 33:42.909
Devon, I need some answers.

33:42.987 --> 33:44.648
Is it a corporation
or isn't it?

33:44.722 --> 33:48.249
Unified Ranch Incorporated is what
is known as a closed corporation.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.658
It has one majority
stockholder.

33:50.962 --> 33:54.898
Unfortunately, the only way to
uncover his identity is to find out...

33:54.966 --> 33:58.231
who actually holds
the securities themselves.

33:58.302 --> 34:01.271
It's got to be the Bartons.
Yes, that may well be.

34:01.339 --> 34:04.638
Unfortunately, at this moment in time,
it's going to be difficult to prove.

34:04.709 --> 34:06.404
Time's the operative word,
Devon.

34:06.477 --> 34:08.638
Rebecca's running out of it,
along with her cattle.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.909
Michael, if you think about it,
none of this makes any sense anyway.

34:11.983 --> 34:14.042
Why would anyone want to
buy Rebecca's ranch...

34:14.118 --> 34:16.416
enough to go to these lengths?
Bonnie's right, Michael.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.456
Ranching is one of the most depressed
businesses in the country today.

34:19.524 --> 34:22.288
Who says they want Rebecca's
ranch for ranching, anyway?

34:22.360 --> 34:24.851
What other purpose could there
be? I don't know, Devon...

34:24.929 --> 34:28.330
but it's gotta be big, because
they sure want it bad enough.

34:28.399 --> 34:30.958
Michael, you've got that look
in your eye again.

34:31.034 --> 34:33.435
What are you thinking about?
Oh, nothing.

34:33.504 --> 34:38.065
Just a little old R and R
at the Shaggy Buffalo.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.804
Beer, please.

35:22.687 --> 35:25.087
KITT, I think this place
needs a new disk jockey.

35:25.156 --> 35:26.783
Put on something
I can dance to.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.553
How about Swan Lake?

35:28.626 --> 35:31.925
Yeah, right.
Just kidding, Michael.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.774
I'll take over for you.

36:04.862 --> 36:06.329
Take a hike, pal.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.797
One more time, please. Michael,
if you're not careful...

36:12.870 --> 36:15.031
they'll be doing the Texas
Two-step on your head.

36:15.106 --> 36:18.098
Just put on some
rock 'n' roll, will you?

36:18.176 --> 36:20.508
Hey, wait.
Now, what's happening?

36:26.918 --> 36:30.479
Hey, wait a minute. It's not me.
It's that guy over there smiling.

36:34.992 --> 36:37.119
So, it really was you, huh?

36:45.036 --> 36:47.334
I'm a nice guy
once you get to know me.

37:23.241 --> 37:27.075
All right, KITT, amplify the
tambours. Right away, Michael.

38:21.499 --> 38:24.229
That is fantastic.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.549
Hi-Ho KITT. Away!

38:49.593 --> 38:52.687
KITT, can you give me
an overlay of Rebecca's ranch?

38:52.763 --> 38:54.094
Whatever that "X"
represents...

38:54.165 --> 38:56.030
I'm positive it's somewhere
on Rebecca's ranch.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.761
If you're suggesting
mineral deposits...

38:57.835 --> 39:01.236
I happen to know that the old gold
mines have been picked clean years ago.

39:01.305 --> 39:03.330
And there's no record
of oil in this area.

39:03.407 --> 39:05.898
Well, it's got to be
something. X marks the spot.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.034
KITT, let's find it.

39:07.111 --> 39:09.545
Michael, you know
there's an APB out on you?

39:09.613 --> 39:10.671
Not the first time.

39:10.748 --> 39:12.875
Yes, but I have absolutely
no influence in this area.

39:12.950 --> 39:14.247
None whatsoever.

39:14.318 --> 39:16.878
If you're caught,
I can do nothing to help you.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.047
And you must also consider
the Foundation.

39:19.123 --> 39:21.557
After all, we are
a law-abiding organization.

39:21.625 --> 39:24.185
I'll keep it in mind, Devon.
Thanks.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.668
Michael, it's hopeless.

39:35.740 --> 39:39.676
You're from the Bronx. You're tough.
Don't give up. Don't let them beat you.

39:39.744 --> 39:43.578
It's not just the ranch and
the kids now. It's you, too.

39:43.814 --> 39:46.749
You know, they've been here
twice looking for you already.

39:46.817 --> 39:49.786
They're calling you a fugitive.
I've been called worse.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.151
Affirmative.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.385
Okay, wise guy. You're
supposed to be working here.

39:54.492 --> 39:58.258
I am. As a matter of fact, I think
I've located the mysterious "X."

39:58.329 --> 40:01.992
Where is it? About 10 feet
directly to the left of you.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.673
Now two steps forward.

40:15.880 --> 40:19.782
Looks like someone bored a deep
hole here. Know anything about this?

40:19.850 --> 40:21.317
I sure don't.

40:23.354 --> 40:25.447
I'd say
it's a core sample.

40:26.023 --> 40:29.754
KITT, put on your geological
cap. We need some answers here.

40:29.827 --> 40:32.125
The hole goes down 46 feet,
Michael...

40:32.196 --> 40:36.462
and there appears to be a sizeable
deposit of malidium-sulfate.

40:36.534 --> 40:39.401
Malidium-sulfate?
What's that?

40:39.470 --> 40:43.463
It's a space age ore. Extremely
valuable, once it's strip-mined...

40:43.541 --> 40:47.204
and Rebecca's ranch sits right
on top of the mother lode.

40:47.778 --> 40:51.805
Strip-mining? Do you know
what that does to the land?

40:51.882 --> 40:54.578
It makes the Bronx
look like a rose garden.

40:54.652 --> 40:58.645
Unfortunately that's not
against the law, but rustling is.

40:58.722 --> 41:00.690
And I think these guys
are desperate enough...

41:00.758 --> 41:03.955
to make that one big mistake.
Cat, I want you to drift into town.

41:04.028 --> 41:05.052
Spread the word...

41:05.129 --> 41:07.256
we're moving the entire stock
to the south pasture.

41:07.331 --> 41:09.822
But that's where they hit
us last time. That's right.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.595
We'll make it a lot easier
for them this time.

41:11.669 --> 41:14.467
Jawing about it is one thing, but
catching them is something else.

41:14.538 --> 41:17.371
Yeah, Cat, but I got
an ace up my sleeve.

41:17.741 --> 41:21.507
See this little guy? They use
this to track game in Africa.

41:21.579 --> 41:23.877
A couple dozen cattle
should be a pushover.

41:31.822 --> 41:36.259
If my friends in New York saw
me now, they'd think I was crazy.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.685
You know what?

41:40.731 --> 41:42.631
Sometimes crazy helps.

41:48.305 --> 41:50.432
Michael,
they're not coming.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.143
They'll come.

41:56.247 --> 41:58.340
It's just a matter of time.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.316
They'll come.

42:34.084 --> 42:35.312
Michael.

42:37.922 --> 42:39.412
Got you, pal.

42:45.162 --> 42:46.629
Michael, it worked.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.765
Not yet.

42:52.136 --> 42:56.163
Not till I get down there and follow
them and round up the rest of the gang.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.765
Man, look at the size
of that thing.

43:01.378 --> 43:02.640
Radical.

43:02.880 --> 43:05.678
Bizarre.
Let's go get them, Michael.

43:05.749 --> 43:09.515
Wait a minute.
It's a job for me and KITT.

43:10.087 --> 43:13.250
Hey, man, there's no way we're
gonna miss out on a rumble.

43:13.324 --> 43:15.019
That's the fact, Jack.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.117
You're looking at the warlord
of the Purple Gang.

43:17.194 --> 43:20.391
Diablo, Magic,
you guys gotta stay here.

43:20.464 --> 43:22.489
What if they send up
some more bad guys?

43:22.566 --> 43:25.364
You got to take care
of the ladies. You be cool.

43:25.436 --> 43:26.903
Right.
Yeah.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.513
We're not going to blow this
rumble, man. And you know that.

43:37.581 --> 43:40.379
Cat, you heard the man. Stay
here and defend the women.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.817
Yo, let's head them
off at the pass. Right.

43:42.886 --> 43:44.410
Hey, come on, you guys.

43:44.488 --> 43:46.888
Yo, we'll take the short cuts
over the bridge top.

43:46.957 --> 43:48.219
Right on.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.186
Looks like they're turning off
the highway, KITT.

44:19.256 --> 44:21.281
Map overlay indicates
Old Canyon Road.

44:21.358 --> 44:24.384
Does the map overlay
indicate where it goes? No.

44:24.461 --> 44:28.090
But, were I to hazard a guess,
I'd say into an old canyon.

44:28.165 --> 44:31.726
Thanks, pal. We'll just hang
back until they rendezvous.

44:50.587 --> 44:52.418
He's onto us, Alfred.

44:52.489 --> 44:55.151
This time,
he's in for a big surprise.

45:21.719 --> 45:25.621
KITT, I've got a feeling here.
What feeling?

45:26.256 --> 45:27.848
That feeling.

45:54.718 --> 45:56.777
Michael, am I seeing double?

45:56.854 --> 45:58.583
Afraid not, pal.

46:12.102 --> 46:13.501
We're running out of room.

46:13.570 --> 46:15.595
It's all timing.

46:32.990 --> 46:34.423
I knew
you could do it, Michael.

46:34.491 --> 46:36.584
Better get some help
out here, pal.

46:36.960 --> 46:40.691
The state police,
an ambulance...

46:40.764 --> 46:44.165
and a couple of very,
very big tow trucks.

46:52.643 --> 46:53.974
All right.

46:54.511 --> 46:57.776
Well, looks like the Right-On-Ranch
will make it after all.

46:58.148 --> 47:00.343
Right on.
Right on, brother.

47:00.417 --> 47:01.475
Yeah.

47:08.759 --> 47:12.195
Like I was saying, KITT,
there was Billy the Kidd.

47:12.262 --> 47:14.787
With two D's?
Yeah, that's the one.

47:14.865 --> 47:18.130
Standing right over there,
just about where that stump is.

47:18.202 --> 47:22.605
So, I just took my trusty lasso,
whirled it high over my head...

47:22.673 --> 47:24.265
and let her rip.

47:27.978 --> 47:30.139
Now, here's the way
I would handle it.

47:32.749 --> 47:35.343
Now, what do you think
of that, partner?

47:38.055 --> 47:39.181
KITT.

47:40.424 --> 47:44.258
Something tells me you were
once a Texas Ranger yourself.

47:44.828 --> 47:46.056
Chow time?

47:46.129 --> 47:47.790
Hot dogs. Get your hot dogs.

47:47.865 --> 47:50.299
Straight from Coney Island.
Who wants to be the first?

47:50.367 --> 47:52.335
Real food. All right.

47:53.637 --> 47:54.729
Yeah.

47:55.939 --> 47:58.430
Not worth the fight, huh?
Says who?

47:58.508 --> 48:00.601
Right on, brother.
Yeah.

48:00.878 --> 48:01.902
Right on.
