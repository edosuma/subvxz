WEBVTT

00:54.541 --> 00:59.250
Well, Crowder, are we gonna sit here
all day, or can we get to business?

01:00.125 --> 01:01.250
Let's see it.

01:07.958 --> 01:11.083
Uh-uh-uh. Payment first.

01:12.458 --> 01:15.541
Not until I know it's not one
of your two-bit knockoffs.

01:29.041 --> 01:32.000
Hmm. I thought you worked alone?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.333
Things change.

01:33.333 --> 01:36.500
I'm teaching her
the fine art of negotiation.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.541
Looks like we have a deal.

01:57.666 --> 02:00.041
Poison's not typically my drink.

02:00.041 --> 02:03.875
Impressive, for a pirate.

02:08.166 --> 02:13.083
She's not a pirate.
She's a liberator of ancient wonders.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.583
That I am.

02:17.625 --> 02:19.708
Oh-oh!

02:20.458 --> 02:24.375
If you want to kill me,
you'll have to do better than that.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.000
Hmm.

02:33.791 --> 02:35.083
New pet?

02:41.958 --> 02:44.250
I'll be taking the artifact now.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.875
You should've brought
more muscle than that, Phee.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.083
She did.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.458
Now it's getting interesting.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.500
Huh?

03:23.208 --> 03:25.958
Yes, I am playing against myself.

03:25.958 --> 03:28.666
It is the only time
this game is a challenge.

03:28.666 --> 03:30.916
<i>Tech, we need a pickup.</i>

03:32.125 --> 03:33.208
On my way.

03:36.916 --> 03:39.083
- I think it's time to go.
- Wrecker!

04:03.333 --> 04:06.416
Now that was a fun mission.

04:06.416 --> 04:09.666
You got that right.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.750
You know,
Omega was pretty impressive back there.

04:14.333 --> 04:15.750
Her training's paying off.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.875
Oh, I know she's got
the whole soldier-thing down.

04:19.458 --> 04:23.166
But don't you think
she should learn some other skills?

04:23.166 --> 04:25.375
What other skills?

04:25.375 --> 04:28.166
Omega spends all her time with you three.

04:28.916 --> 04:31.083
She needs friends.

04:31.083 --> 04:35.125
Ones her own age
and who don't share her genetic profile.

04:35.125 --> 04:37.208
We never had such a thing.

04:37.958 --> 04:39.291
I do not see the issue.

04:39.875 --> 04:41.083
No kidding.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.041
We're receiving a transmission.

04:45.041 --> 04:46.375
It is from Cid.

04:46.958 --> 04:47.958
Let's hear it.

04:56.500 --> 05:00.125
<i>So, it's been 20 rotations and no word.</i>

05:00.125 --> 05:05.041
<i>You better be dead because
your absence has cost me a few scores.</i>

05:05.625 --> 05:09.250
<i>Remember our mutually
beneficial arrangements,</i>

05:09.250 --> 05:13.416
<i>and how well we know one another,
if you know what I mean.</i>

05:13.416 --> 05:19.958
<i>You'd do well to not assume
I am just threatening you boys.</i>

05:22.833 --> 05:26.333
You didn't mention you cut ties with Cid.

05:26.333 --> 05:33.000
Our mutually beneficial arrangement
wasn't so beneficial, mutually.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.291
Figured that out, did you?

05:35.291 --> 05:37.041
I've known Cid a long time.

05:37.041 --> 05:41.791
She's a useful ally,
but not someone you want to cross.

05:42.458 --> 05:43.708
Do you have a plan?

05:45.416 --> 05:47.291
You're looking at it.

05:49.708 --> 05:52.333
In that case, you all are coming with me.

05:53.041 --> 05:55.541
Head to these coordinates, brown eyes.

06:35.708 --> 06:39.041
Welcome to Pabu, my home away from home.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.583
It's a hidden sanctuary of sorts.

06:42.583 --> 06:45.666
That's the Archium.
It's where the artifact will be stored.

06:46.291 --> 06:48.958
It holds treasures
from all over the galaxy.

06:49.916 --> 06:53.750
My analysis indicates that
this so-called artifact you recovered is

06:53.750 --> 06:56.083
of very little to no monetary value.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.458
Treasure can mean many things.

06:58.458 --> 07:02.041
Most of the villagers
on Pabu are refugees.

07:02.041 --> 07:05.333
Many of the items I recover are remnants
of their cultures,

07:05.333 --> 07:07.000
and that's worth preserving.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.166
After all, I am a liberator--

07:09.166 --> 07:11.541
Liberator of ancient wonders.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.291
About time
you showed your face around here.

07:15.916 --> 07:17.041
Miss me, Shep?

07:17.041 --> 07:19.250
You've got some competition.

07:20.375 --> 07:22.083
Auntie Phee!

07:22.791 --> 07:24.208
What'd you bring this time?

07:27.958 --> 07:29.500
Looks like one of a kind.

07:29.500 --> 07:30.666
Good eye.

07:30.666 --> 07:33.208
That's not all you brought, I see.

07:35.333 --> 07:40.166
This is Shep Hazard, Mayor of Pabu,
and his daughter, Lyana.

07:41.291 --> 07:45.791
Shep, Lyana, meet Omega,
Hunter, Wrecker and Tech.

07:46.625 --> 07:49.875
Welcome.

07:49.875 --> 07:51.333
- And--
- Put her there!

07:51.333 --> 07:54.125
Oh.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.250
Phee's never brought
any friends here before.

07:57.791 --> 08:00.083
Never? Not even Cid?

08:00.916 --> 08:01.916
Nope.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.916
So why bring us?

08:03.916 --> 08:06.083
Makes you wonder, doesn't it?

08:06.833 --> 08:08.708
She must really like you.

08:08.708 --> 08:11.041
All right. That's enough out of you.

08:11.041 --> 08:13.166
Then it's settled.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.833
You'll join us for dinner.

08:14.833 --> 08:17.416
There's no saying no
to Shep's famous feast.

08:17.416 --> 08:20.750
Lots of food, drink
and general merrymaking.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.041
You'll probably hate it.

08:23.041 --> 08:24.250
It'll be great.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.291
Lead the way, Shep. I'll catch up.

08:34.541 --> 08:36.500
Gonna put this someplace safe.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.375
Wow!

08:58.750 --> 09:00.625
Wait till you see it up close.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.833
Upper Pabu is
the oldest part of the island.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.958
As we've grown over the years,

09:05.958 --> 09:08.708
we've expanded below the wall
into Lower Pabu.

09:08.708 --> 09:10.750
Hi, Shep.

09:11.291 --> 09:13.125
Hi, Mr. Eenta.

09:13.125 --> 09:14.541
How are Sari and Micha?

09:14.541 --> 09:17.333
They're doing good.

09:17.333 --> 09:19.083
Thanks for asking, Shep.

09:19.708 --> 09:22.500
Well, uh-- Do you know everyone here?

09:22.500 --> 09:25.041
Of course. We're all like family.

09:32.625 --> 09:33.708
Come, come.

09:34.291 --> 09:35.500
Make yourselves at home.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.208
Not too shabby, is it?

10:03.250 --> 10:05.250
They're called moon-yos.

10:05.250 --> 10:09.083
The elders say they've lived here
since before Pabu was inhabited.

10:12.583 --> 10:16.708
I have not heard her laugh like that
in some time.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.708
Phee said the villagers here are refugees.

10:29.291 --> 10:30.625
Many, yes.

10:30.625 --> 10:34.083
Pabu has been a safe haven
for those forced to flee their homes

10:34.083 --> 10:36.708
during the war and others after.

10:37.375 --> 10:40.833
And you're not worried
the Empire will show up?

10:40.833 --> 10:42.083
Why would they?

10:42.833 --> 10:45.791
We're a remote island
with limited resources.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.750
But if they do, we'll manage.

10:54.458 --> 10:57.916
Some come to Pabu looking
for a clean slate.

10:57.916 --> 10:59.208
A chance to start over.

11:00.125 --> 11:04.000
As a father, you couldn't ask
for a better place to raise a child.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.875
Something to think about, isn't it?

11:13.291 --> 11:18.000
You're suggesting we all stay
on Pabu permanently?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.416
Aw. [laughs] Oh!

11:20.416 --> 11:23.666
Hey, come here.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.416
She seems to like it here.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.958
A little stability
might do you all some good.

11:57.791 --> 12:00.000
You have your own boat?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.125
Uh-huh. You wanna take it out
and watch the sunset?

12:03.125 --> 12:04.208
Really?

12:04.833 --> 12:08.541
That sounds like a great idea, doesn't it?

12:08.541 --> 12:09.791
Can I go?

12:10.375 --> 12:11.458
Have fun.

12:23.166 --> 12:24.458
What's with you?

12:25.125 --> 12:26.166
I'm full.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.500
I am never full.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.750
I will note the date and time
to commemorate such a momentous occasion.

12:34.583 --> 12:35.583
You--

12:35.583 --> 12:37.500
What? Huh?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.958
Hope you saved room for dessert.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.458
I love this place!

13:40.250 --> 13:43.250
I spent most of my life
surrounded by the ocean,

13:43.250 --> 13:46.250
but it didn't feel like this place.

13:46.916 --> 13:48.416
Why'd you leave?

13:50.250 --> 13:51.375
The Empire.

13:51.958 --> 13:52.958
I'm so sorry.

13:54.541 --> 13:55.916
But you're safe here.

13:56.625 --> 13:59.833
You and your friends can stay
as long as you want.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.083
We never stay anywhere for long.

14:03.083 --> 14:04.541
Never?

14:04.541 --> 14:07.000
Doesn't that get lonely?

14:09.208 --> 14:11.750
I never really thought about it.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.208
It's almost time.

14:20.833 --> 14:21.958
For what?

14:21.958 --> 14:23.250
See for yourself.

14:29.958 --> 14:32.916
I am not seeing anything.

14:32.916 --> 14:35.166
Just wait. It'll be worth it.

14:47.708 --> 14:50.125
Pretty spectacular, right?

14:51.458 --> 14:56.291
I suppose that is one way to quantify it.

15:24.250 --> 15:25.333
What's wrong?

15:39.583 --> 15:40.708
Something's coming.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.583
We need to--

15:52.666 --> 15:53.833
What was that?

15:54.500 --> 15:55.708
Just a tremor.

15:55.708 --> 15:58.333
It's no big deal, happens all the time.

16:01.083 --> 16:02.458
Are you sure?

16:02.458 --> 16:07.416
Yeah, but let's head in just to be safe.

16:18.666 --> 16:21.041
<i>Omega, come in.</i>

16:21.041 --> 16:22.208
<i>Are you two okay?</i>

16:22.750 --> 16:25.541
We're fine.
We're headed back to shore now.

16:30.375 --> 16:31.750
Everyone all right?

16:34.291 --> 16:36.583
Well, that was different.

16:36.583 --> 16:39.208
Uh, a small tremor.
It's nothing to worry about.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.041
Part of island life.

16:42.208 --> 16:44.750
I don't think it's over yet.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.208
That was not a small tremor.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.458
No, it was not.

17:05.458 --> 17:09.750
Hunter, I believe this island is at risk
for a significant sea surge.

17:09.750 --> 17:10.833
How much risk?

17:11.416 --> 17:13.166
Highly probable to imminent.

17:13.166 --> 17:17.041
We haven't had a sea surge
in more than three decades.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.916
If we were at risk, the early
warning system would've activated.

17:19.916 --> 17:21.500
And--

17:21.500 --> 17:23.625
I don't like the sound of that.

17:45.041 --> 17:47.500
The water has already begun receding.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.333
We must evacuate all of Lower Pabu.

17:49.916 --> 17:52.250
Lyana and Omega, they're on the water.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.916
I'll grab our ship and get them.

17:53.916 --> 17:56.541
You four, move everyone in town
to higher ground.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.125
Why aren't we moving?

18:17.291 --> 18:18.958
The tide's pulling us out.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.875
We're gonna hit the rocks.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.083
We have to jump.

18:25.791 --> 18:26.791
One.

18:26.791 --> 18:27.916
Two.

18:27.916 --> 18:29.125
Three!

18:37.708 --> 18:40.166
Please evacuate to Upper Pabu immediately.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.958
Knock on every door. Check every home.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.875
Lyana. Lyana!

18:54.791 --> 18:55.791
Wake up!

18:56.916 --> 18:57.916
Wake up!

19:02.500 --> 19:04.333
Are you okay?

19:05.833 --> 19:07.000
I think so.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.125
We have to keep moving.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.291
Omega.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.541
Hunter, we're in trouble.

19:22.541 --> 19:25.375
<i>There's a giant wave coming,
and we're too far out.</i>

19:25.375 --> 19:26.458
<i>What do we do?</i>

19:26.458 --> 19:28.500
Keep your locator on, and head to shore.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.583
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

19:30.083 --> 19:31.083
Come on.

19:37.291 --> 19:38.291
Clear!

19:38.291 --> 19:39.666
Same!

19:46.416 --> 19:48.750
There are too many trying
to get through at once.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.750
They will not make it
before the surge hits.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.500
We must use additional means
to get them over the wall.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.500
We can deploy the rescue ladders.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.375
- Where?
- They line the top of each wall.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.333
Hang on!

20:15.083 --> 20:17.458
You take those ladders. I'll handle these.

20:21.416 --> 20:23.041
The mechanisms are rusted through.

20:23.041 --> 20:25.333
We will need to manually unfurl them.

20:33.791 --> 20:35.291
This way!

20:48.750 --> 20:50.208
This is the last one.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.750
Eh. Can I help you?

20:52.750 --> 20:55.708
Everything will be fine, Mr. Eenta.

20:56.791 --> 20:59.166
What is happening?

21:07.083 --> 21:10.041
Omega, I've reached the ship. Hang tight!

21:17.083 --> 21:19.250
The water's moving too fast!

21:22.500 --> 21:23.750
Don't stop running!

21:27.750 --> 21:28.833
There!

21:32.583 --> 21:34.416
I see you. Grab the line.

21:54.625 --> 21:55.958
Over here!

22:26.000 --> 22:27.333
Whoa!

22:50.250 --> 22:52.083
Thank the stars.

23:40.125 --> 23:41.125
Shh.

23:50.083 --> 23:52.000
We got everyone out in time.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.500
That's what's important.

23:54.416 --> 23:56.291
Based on my estimations,

23:56.291 --> 24:00.666
it will take several rotations to rebuild
the damage sustained in Lower Pabu.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.166
Yes.

24:03.166 --> 24:07.083
Property was destroyed,
but my people are resilient.

24:08.041 --> 24:09.875
We'll band together and rebuild.

24:10.375 --> 24:12.875
I was thinking.

24:14.083 --> 24:17.166
We could stay and help out with things.

24:17.166 --> 24:19.416
I had the same idea.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.000
Did you now?

24:23.791 --> 24:27.791
That is, if you don't mind us
sticking around for a while.

24:28.625 --> 24:31.375
You would be most welcome.
