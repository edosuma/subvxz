But the blisterberries --
we eat them to survive!

08:54.013 --> 08:55.147
Carl: Oh, that's too bad.

08:55.147 --> 08:56.281
I guess you're gonna have
to switch

08:56.281 --> 08:58.781
to monkey-corn meat.

08:58.781 --> 09:00.481
Oh, come on, man!

09:00.481 --> 09:02.648
We're vegans!

09:02.648 --> 09:04.282
Carl:
You'll figure something out.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.649
'Cause this is coming with me.

09:06.649 --> 09:09.249
And you, woman --
what's your name?

09:09.249 --> 09:12.283
Zaffy, you like to swim?

09:12.983 --> 09:14.016
Frylock: Hey, carl.

09:14.016 --> 09:15.850
Carl: Oh, hey, red one.

09:15.850 --> 09:17.517
Have you come to
"reason with me"?

09:17.517 --> 09:19.884
Frylock: I just think you've
already made some serious bank

09:19.884 --> 09:21.217
on that storage space, okay?

09:21.217 --> 09:23.285
So why not just leave them
little people alone?

09:23.285 --> 09:25.052
Carl: Yeah, I mean, maybe.

09:25.052 --> 09:26.152
I don't know.

09:26.152 --> 09:27.785
What do you think, Zaffy?

09:27.785 --> 09:30.653
It's your call. You own it.

09:30.653 --> 09:34.753
At this point, I need to do
what's best for Zaffy.

09:34.753 --> 09:35.953
Carl: That's my girl.

09:35.953 --> 09:39.054
Yeah, she saw the writing
on the wall, didn't you, Zaffy?

09:39.054 --> 09:42.787
You want me to rub some lotion
on them green buns of yours?

09:42.787 --> 09:43.788
Frylock: What's this bush for?

09:43.788 --> 09:44.888
Carl: Blisterberries.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.921
The juice
will screw you sideways.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.756
Zaffy's had three already.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.222
But she is still good to go.

09:51.222 --> 09:55.156
Carl, I can't get a tan here.

09:55.156 --> 09:58.990
Why is my skin not tanning?

09:58.990 --> 10:00.657
Carl:
'cause you're friggin' green.

10:00.657 --> 10:04.658
Come on, honey. You and me are
gonna go inside and throw down.

10:04.658 --> 10:08.158
Then we'll go back
to ol' magic land over there

10:08.158 --> 10:11.325
and take their friggin' sun.

10:11.325 --> 10:14.592
Zarfonius, have you raided
the other storage units?

10:14.592 --> 10:15.725
We have.

10:15.725 --> 10:17.693
You will distract him
with that moose head

10:17.693 --> 10:19.993
and wearing those
unfashionable neckties.

10:19.993 --> 10:21.226
I will fire at him repeatedly

10:21.226 --> 10:23.861
with this antique
civil war musket.

10:23.861 --> 10:25.161
When he falls, you Zingo,

10:25.161 --> 10:27.727
will surround him
with priceless baseball cards

10:27.727 --> 10:28.927
and set them ablaze.

10:28.927 --> 10:32.862
And you, Zerbus, will cram
old tax records into his mouth

10:32.862 --> 10:35.795
until he can no longer breathe.

10:35.795 --> 10:37.263
The alcoholic giant!

10:37.263 --> 10:38.829
He has awoken!

10:38.829 --> 10:41.596
N-o-o-ow!

10:41.596 --> 10:44.697
Carl: Hey, excuse me. You mind
if I put my ladder here?

10:44.697 --> 10:48.330
I need it so I can steal
your friggin' sun.

10:48.330 --> 10:49.597
No!

10:49.597 --> 10:52.665
Without our sun,
it will be night always!

10:52.665 --> 10:55.365
And the night wolf
will hunt us forever

10:55.365 --> 10:58.332
and ever until we are dead!

10:58.332 --> 10:59.899
Carl: Well, look at that.

10:59.899 --> 11:03.199
It just unscrews off in my hand.

11:03.933 --> 11:05.133
The night wolf!

11:05.133 --> 11:07.000
Carl: Get out of here,
you mangy piece of --

11:07.000 --> 11:09.133
oh, god damn it! My scrotum!

11:10.305 --> 11:16.572
