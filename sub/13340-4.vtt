WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.049
- Previously on
"Good Girls"...

00:06.093 --> 00:07.224
- We got a mutual friend
turns out.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.617
He's talking to the feds now.

00:08.660 --> 00:09.922
So, I'm gonna need you
to handle that.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.272
- You are ratting out a gang,

00:11.315 --> 00:12.664
you think they're gonna
let you talk?

00:12.708 --> 00:14.492
You gotta disappear for good.
How much?

00:14.536 --> 00:15.276
- 20,000.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.668
- I took a payday loan.

00:16.712 --> 00:17.930
I used your check
as collateral

00:17.974 --> 00:19.062
and forged your name.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.498
- We'll figure it out.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.978
- He said there's
someone else.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.545
- They're out of cinnamon,
so...

00:23.588 --> 00:26.852
- Hey, stupid bitch.
Open the damn door.

00:26.896 --> 00:27.853
- Ooh.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.335
- It was an accident.

00:31.379 --> 00:33.946
- Where did you, um, put it?

00:33.990 --> 00:36.079
- We have a--a meat freezer.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.472
- Who keeps calling this dude?

00:37.515 --> 00:38.386
- It's Marion.

00:38.429 --> 00:39.604
- If you would just give me

00:39.648 --> 00:41.084
a quick ring when you get in.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.825
I just can't get to sleep.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.131
- I'm worried about Leslie.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.568
I didn't know who else I could
talk to, so...

00:46.611 --> 00:47.786
- What's going on?

00:47.830 --> 00:49.701
- I think something bad
happened.

00:49.745 --> 00:50.746
all: Three!

00:50.789 --> 00:52.313
- Okay, let's just go.

03:47.314 --> 03:49.446
- What is on tap for you today?

03:49.490 --> 03:51.361
- Just the usual:

03:51.405 --> 03:53.842
Groceries, carpool,
dry cleaning.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.539
- What, no book club?

03:55.583 --> 03:58.325
- No.
- Oh.

03:58.368 --> 04:00.414
What, a bad pick this month?

04:00.457 --> 04:02.807
- You know, just some
crime thriller.

04:05.201 --> 04:06.942
- Got way too dark.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.857
- That's pretty funny.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.080
- There she is.
How does it feel?

04:15.124 --> 04:16.734
We gotta celebrate.

04:16.778 --> 04:20.477
You did it, you're a boss now.

04:20.521 --> 04:23.437
Hey, can we get a couple, uh...

04:23.480 --> 04:24.916
What's your poison, huh?

04:24.960 --> 04:27.310
Like a--like a summer rosé
or something?

04:27.354 --> 04:29.356
- It's 10:00 in the morning.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.401
- The lady will take
a crisp chardonnay.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.273
- Thank you, I'm not staying.

04:33.316 --> 04:34.665
- You're sure?

04:34.709 --> 04:36.885
I'm giving you the keys
to the kingdom here.

04:36.928 --> 04:37.886
- Why?

04:37.929 --> 04:39.409
- I'm out.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.933
I'm done, man,
time for something new.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.631
- No, why me?

04:45.546 --> 04:47.156
- I think you
could be something.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.071
- I don't wanna be something.

04:49.114 --> 04:50.986
- No?

04:51.029 --> 04:52.379
What you wanna be then, huh?

04:52.422 --> 04:54.816
A fireman?
Astronaut?

04:54.859 --> 04:57.297
- I don't know.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.473
A good person.

04:59.516 --> 05:02.650
- No, you're way more
interesting than that.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.000
- You don't know me.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.828
- I think I do.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.484
- I don't drink rosé.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.618
- Can we get a bourbon
on the rocks?

05:27.979 --> 05:30.634
If you change your mind...
- I won't.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.375
- Kingdom's in your name.

05:36.031 --> 05:38.555
- And don't throw
the bacon grease out, dear.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.079
I cook with that.
- Got it.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.348
Hey, what's this stuff?

05:48.391 --> 05:52.047
- Oh, that's for Leslie.
He does my finances.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.571
- This one says "final notice."

05:54.615 --> 05:57.052
- Well, he'll iron it out.

05:59.881 --> 06:02.753
- Marion, this says
you're being evicted.

06:02.797 --> 06:05.103
- Oh, he'll fix all that.

06:05.147 --> 06:09.760
Gesture of congratulations.
Twelve letters.

06:09.804 --> 06:12.502
- Well...

06:12.546 --> 06:14.678
What if he can't fix it?

06:14.722 --> 06:18.856
Just 'cause, you know,
he's not around right now.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.946
- Well, he's gonna come back.

06:21.990 --> 06:25.080
He has to.
He does everything for me.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.044
- Pat on the back.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.437
- I'm sorry?

06:34.481 --> 06:37.571
- Gesture of congratulations.
Twelve letters.

06:40.704 --> 06:43.533
- Well, look at you,
Ms. Smarty-Pants!

06:45.448 --> 06:47.058
- That's what they call me.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.201
- What's going on?

06:59.244 --> 07:03.814
- Um, homeless shelter,
youth home, church pantry.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.904
Spread the Joy Detroit
only wants PB&J.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.733
Now, I'm all for a theme,
but really?

07:09.777 --> 07:11.779
The homeless get
to be picky now?

07:21.571 --> 07:22.790
- You okay?

07:25.488 --> 07:27.577
- I'm a smart man.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.757
- Okay.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.193
- You know, I'm talking
common sense,

07:35.237 --> 07:37.021
"I know some bull
when I see it" smart.

07:37.065 --> 07:38.588
- Uh-huh.

07:38.632 --> 07:42.287
- But there I stood
in the Qwik Ca$h line,

07:42.331 --> 07:43.941
uniform and everything.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.204
Ready to tell these fools
that even though we might look

07:46.248 --> 07:47.771
like every person that walks
through that door,

07:47.815 --> 07:49.033
that's not who we are, right?

07:49.077 --> 07:50.557
- That's right.
- That's right.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.862
And they can save their crap
for the next Joe

07:51.906 --> 07:53.124
with "sucker" written
on his forehead,

07:53.168 --> 07:54.212
'cause I'm not the one.

07:54.256 --> 07:55.823
Not today.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.262
- What happened?

08:01.829 --> 08:04.266
- I walked out.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.094
- Stanley.

08:08.052 --> 08:09.793
- With a second loan
to cover the first one.

08:09.837 --> 08:13.754
- Stanley Lamont Hill,
we just got another EOB.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.844
- I think I might have even
said "thank you."

08:16.887 --> 08:19.629
- Oh, my--what are we gonna do?

08:19.673 --> 08:22.197
- You might wanna keep
that corn.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.515
- You have to spend money
to make money.

08:35.558 --> 08:38.387
You know, these bank people,
they just don't understand.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.520
- How does this happen again?

08:40.563 --> 08:42.086
- It's called an investment,
you know?

08:42.130 --> 08:43.000
- Oh, my God.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.262
- It's gonna take a minute.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.568
I took my eye off the ball,

08:45.612 --> 08:47.527
I was learning to walk again,
shoot me.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.745
Oh, wait...

08:48.789 --> 08:50.530
- Oh, my God.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.792
- It looks a lot worse
than what it is.

08:51.835 --> 08:54.534
- They are taking everything.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.666
- Yeah, but we still have
the 'Vette.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.189
- That is one car.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.974
- Yes, but I'm gonna sell
that 'Vette,

09:00.017 --> 09:01.889
and I'm gonna take the money
and get some fresh blood.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.499
Right? And then it's Halloween,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.849
and we have all those fall
promos and the Spooktacular.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.808
The people
love the Spooktacular.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.505
We're gonna move...

09:11.072 --> 09:13.248
- I have to show you guys
something.

09:47.021 --> 09:48.762
- I know.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.200
- I know.

09:52.243 --> 09:53.767
- Fake?

09:53.810 --> 09:55.333
- Yeah.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.509
- And he doesn't want a cut?

09:57.553 --> 09:59.250
- Nope.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.427
- How much?

10:03.559 --> 10:05.300
- A lot.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.479
- So, I'm thinking we just
wash a little, right?

10:10.522 --> 10:11.741
Just to dig us out--

10:11.785 --> 10:13.047
- How long?

10:13.090 --> 10:14.875
- What?

10:14.918 --> 10:17.791
- How long have you had this?

10:17.834 --> 10:19.444
- Not that long.

10:19.488 --> 10:20.924
- This right here...

10:20.968 --> 10:24.275
- So, you just--you weren't
gonna tell us, or?

10:24.319 --> 10:25.407
- This is 20 grand.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.800
- Well, I'm telling you now.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.454
- Yeah, now that
you're in trouble.

10:29.498 --> 10:30.934
- Are you serious right now?

10:30.978 --> 10:33.023
- "Are you serious right now?"

10:33.067 --> 10:34.546
- 60 G's right here.

10:34.590 --> 10:37.985
- There's no point,
I tried counting it for weeks.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.813
- Hold up.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.510
Did you just say "weeks"?

10:41.553 --> 10:43.904
- I was trying to protect you.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.122
- From what?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.689
From being rich and happy?

10:46.733 --> 10:50.345
- We got this by killing a man.

10:50.388 --> 10:52.042
- We didn't kill anyone.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.522
- No.

10:55.045 --> 10:56.699
We just threw him away.

10:59.397 --> 11:04.489
In a trash bin,
like an old, dirty futon.

11:07.971 --> 11:09.712
- So, we wash what we need,

11:09.756 --> 11:12.846
and--and then we burn the rest.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.457
- Do you wanna know
what I think?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.330
You're not the boss of me.

11:23.813 --> 11:24.858
Yeah.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.600
Okay.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.836
- Hi.
I have some returns.

11:46.880 --> 11:47.837
- I have some returns.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.360
- I have some returns.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.232
- All of it?
- Yeah.

11:51.275 --> 11:53.625
The bride got cold feet
last minute.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.149
You wouldn't believe the drama.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.585
All I can tell you
is the next time

11:56.628 --> 11:57.891
someone asks me to be
in their wedding,

11:57.934 --> 11:59.414
the answer is no.

11:59.457 --> 12:01.198
- Just need to see your ID.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.417
- Why?

12:02.460 --> 12:05.463
I-I have the receipt.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.291
- Our return policy's changed.

12:07.335 --> 12:08.902
- Since when?

12:08.945 --> 12:10.730
- About a month ago.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.080
- Oh.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.081
- Mrs. Hill?

12:18.302 --> 12:19.782
- Is there a problem?

12:19.826 --> 12:21.610
- We know
what you've been doing.

12:21.653 --> 12:26.267
- Southfield, Sterling Heights,

12:26.310 --> 12:30.401
Livonia, Pontiac,

12:30.445 --> 12:32.273
Allen Park.

12:32.316 --> 12:33.796
- You've engaged
in a coordinated pattern

12:33.840 --> 12:37.017
of buying and returning
all over Southeastern Michigan.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.496
- You wanna charge me
with something,

12:38.540 --> 12:39.802
you go right ahead, little man.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.848
'Cause my lawyer's
gonna be so far up

12:41.891 --> 12:43.806
that tight little ass
of yours.

12:52.728 --> 12:53.903
- Beth.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.818
Hi, I meant to ask
after soccer,

12:55.862 --> 12:57.951
where did we land on the...

12:57.994 --> 13:00.867
- I put you on desserts
with Sandy.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.956
- We--we can talk
about this later.

13:02.999 --> 13:05.045
- Root beer floats,
diet for the teachers

13:05.088 --> 13:09.179
and three dozen cupcakes...
no plastic toppers.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.965
And everything's gotta be
nut-free.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.532
- I bet you feel like
some big, strong, manly man.

13:14.576 --> 13:17.318
Like a real cool dude
harassing his loyal customers.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.407
Like some kind of pathetic,
little dick-ass--

13:19.450 --> 13:21.365
- You're not being arrested.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.498
- Oh.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.543
- You just can't shop here
anymore.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.852
- Oh...

13:33.029 --> 13:35.205
Thank you.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.859
- Mm-hmm.

13:47.739 --> 13:50.220
- What the hell, Annie?

13:50.264 --> 13:51.265
- What do you want from me?

13:51.308 --> 13:52.614
- I want you to return a text.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.572
- Well, I have a lot
going on right now.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.313
- Yeah, me too.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.011
- Hey, you know your wife?

13:58.054 --> 14:00.317
Your pregnant wife?
Yeah, she knows.

14:00.361 --> 14:01.753
- Yeah, I'm aware, thank you.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.365
- So, I think it's pretty much
game over, okay?

14:04.408 --> 14:06.541
Can't sink any lower.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.022
- Well, how's this for low?

14:09.065 --> 14:10.023
- Don't.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.067
- I wanna be with you.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.373
- No.
- Yes.

14:12.416 --> 14:13.983
I wanna leave
my pregnant wife--

14:14.027 --> 14:15.419
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- And I wanna just be with you

14:15.463 --> 14:16.812
and just--

14:16.856 --> 14:18.161
I wanna drink
peppermint schnapps

14:18.205 --> 14:20.860
and just look at you
for a while.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.472
- You don't get to do that.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.387
- You know what I've always
loved about you?

14:26.430 --> 14:28.041
- Please don't.

14:28.084 --> 14:29.607
- Your eyebrows.

14:32.132 --> 14:33.307
- You do not.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.525
- I do.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.440
I can't get enough of them.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.407
Wait, what are you doing
with all this stuff?

14:46.450 --> 14:48.496
- Selling it.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.454
Hey, wanna buy a Vitamix?

14:50.498 --> 14:52.630
- I'm living in a motel.

14:52.674 --> 14:56.373
- Yeah but it spins so fast,
it can make soup.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.592
- Oh.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.637
- Huh?

15:01.509 --> 15:03.467
- Let me know
what you wanna do.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.139
- What you doing?

15:26.316 --> 15:28.884
- Just crying
at my screensaver.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.233
- As you do.

15:30.277 --> 15:31.974
- Right?

15:34.846 --> 15:37.327
I mean, look at that.

15:37.371 --> 15:40.852
- Tiny humans.
- So cute.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.076
I'm so sorry.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.820
- I know.

15:53.691 --> 15:57.565
- I really blew it... again.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.009
- Come here.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.234
- No.
- It all has to be anonymous.

16:14.277 --> 16:15.452
- There's no way in hell.

16:15.496 --> 16:16.801
- You'll use a fake name.

16:16.845 --> 16:17.977
- Do you remember
when I had a penis?

16:18.020 --> 16:19.413
'Cause I don't.
- Dean.

16:19.456 --> 16:20.501
- What was it like?
Was it nice?

16:20.544 --> 16:21.806
I seem to recall it had

16:21.850 --> 16:23.156
something to do with
making children.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.548
- Okay.
- What?

16:24.592 --> 16:26.202
The guy shot me, Beth.
- I know that.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.900
- And now you wanna use
his money to pay our bills.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.250
- This is our way out.

16:30.293 --> 16:31.468
- With his dirty-ass money.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.774
- It's my money.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.515
- Oh, yeah?
What'd you do for it?

16:34.558 --> 16:35.951
- A job.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.214
- Is that what we're
calling it now?

16:38.258 --> 16:40.042
- Believe me, I earned it.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.349
- Look, if you could just
give me a little more time.

16:42.392 --> 16:43.872
- For what, Dean?

16:43.915 --> 16:45.569
To sell the 'Vette?

16:45.613 --> 16:47.354
- I could come up with plan B.

16:47.397 --> 16:50.531
- We passed plan B, years ago.

16:50.574 --> 16:54.752
This is it, honey.
This is what's left.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.540
- I hate that guy.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.976
I hate his money.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.327
- Dean.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.550
This isn't money yet.

17:09.593 --> 17:12.422
You have to make it money.

17:18.341 --> 17:19.386
- How?

17:19.429 --> 17:22.563
- You do what you're good at.

17:22.606 --> 17:23.999
You sell cars.

17:30.310 --> 17:33.791
- I got 10 G's of espresso
machines up on eBay.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.315
- Wanna sit?

17:36.838 --> 17:38.361
- I'm about to roll up
to the freeway

17:38.405 --> 17:40.363
and sell this shizz
outta my trunk.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.627
- I did something.

17:43.671 --> 17:46.978
- I literally get hives
every time you say that.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.545
- That's why I asked you
to sit.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.112
- You know what would help?

17:50.156 --> 17:52.027
If you just led
with what you did

17:52.071 --> 17:53.898
instead of letting my mind
run wild.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.509
- I gave Dean the money.

17:55.552 --> 17:58.338
He'll buy with fake
and sell for real,

17:58.381 --> 17:59.643
and we'll take a cut.

17:59.687 --> 18:00.862
- Cars for cash?

18:00.905 --> 18:02.342
- What do you think?

18:03.343 --> 18:04.735
- How much did you give him?

18:05.867 --> 18:07.434
- More than a little.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.393
- She's gonna lose her mind.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.875
- Well, it's just paper
if we can't wash it.

18:13.918 --> 18:14.963
- All right.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.140
- Okay, maybe don't tell her.
- Hey, she's your sister.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.186
- I know, but I hate
asking you to lie.

18:21.404 --> 18:24.451
- Again, we threw a man away.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.497
- We're still gonna burn
the rest.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.847
- You think he can handle it?

18:29.891 --> 18:32.198
- It's what he does.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.381
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.253
This is a 3.6 liter V6.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.472
- What's the difference?

18:45.515 --> 18:48.127
- Oh, well, about
60 horsepower.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.476
- Okay.

18:49.519 --> 18:50.781
- I can always sell you
a bigger car,

18:50.825 --> 18:53.132
but my job is to get you
what you need.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.525
- How much do I need for it
just to drive regular?

18:55.569 --> 18:58.702
- Excuse me, Mr. B,
I got a bite on that 'Vette.

18:58.746 --> 19:01.052
- Ooh, if you'll excuse me,
I'll be right back.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.532
Okay?
- Okay.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.492
It's gonna be okay.
Mommy's gonna get you.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.711
- I have the same car, here.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.365
- Thank you.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.062
- Do you like it?

19:11.106 --> 19:12.890
- I mean, for me, it's perfect.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.545
- How many horses or whatever
did you get?

19:15.589 --> 19:19.723
- I think somewhere between
zero and I really don't care.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.596
- But this is what I love
about it.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.948
This comes right down...

19:28.645 --> 19:30.212
And you can put
your stroller there.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.171
- Oh, cool.
- And see that latch?

19:32.214 --> 19:33.781
It's a new system
for baby seats,

19:33.824 --> 19:36.131
which makes it super easy when
your hands are full, which is--

19:36.175 --> 19:37.567
together: Always.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.439
- Oh, and the cup holders,

19:39.482 --> 19:41.876
they're right where you need
'em for sippies and stuff.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.444
And there's even one
on the dash that pops out.

19:44.487 --> 19:46.489
- You think I could take it
for a test drive?

19:46.533 --> 19:50.232
- I actually don't
work here, but...

19:50.276 --> 19:53.148
- I can't--I can't let you
do that.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.715
I just talked to my guy
in financing,

19:54.758 --> 19:57.500
and the best bang for your buck
is that bad boy

19:57.544 --> 19:59.241
right over there,
not the minivan.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.288
Same sticker price, but it's
twice the car under the hood.

20:02.331 --> 20:05.334
- You know, I gotta get
this one home.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.467
- I understand.
Here, um, think about it.

20:07.510 --> 20:08.685
There's my card.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.253
You know, talk to your husband.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.779
Thanks for coming by
Boland Motors.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.657
- Oh.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.050
That was--that was nice
of Gloria to visit.

20:26.094 --> 20:29.967
- They brought coleslaw
and stayed for five minutes.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.023
- Still, I'm really glad

20:42.066 --> 20:43.633
you got to meet
your great grandchild.

20:43.677 --> 20:47.463
- Well, that's one of us.

20:49.204 --> 20:52.860
Oh, get that, would you?
I've got something in the oven.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.868
- Why are you doing this?

21:00.911 --> 21:03.174
- She's got two days left,
okay?

21:03.218 --> 21:04.306
- What is wrong with you?

21:04.350 --> 21:06.003
- It's the building, not me.

21:06.047 --> 21:07.744
- Look, I will get you
the money for her, okay?

21:07.788 --> 21:09.137
I just need a little more time.

21:09.180 --> 21:11.618
- We've already given her
six months.

21:12.793 --> 21:15.317
- No but her--her grandson
pays her rent.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.363
- Not for the better part
of a year.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.714
- Son of a bitch.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.938
- Hey.
- How'd we do?

21:27.982 --> 21:31.333
- Uh, great.
Yeah, really, really great.

21:31.377 --> 21:32.682
- Yeah?

21:32.726 --> 21:35.642
- Yeah, so many test drives,
you know?

21:37.121 --> 21:38.645
- How many?

21:38.688 --> 21:40.821
- You know, everyone wanted,
uh, they wanted a selfie.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.084
- No, how many did he sell?

21:43.127 --> 21:44.564
- I wouldn't be surprised
if Boland Motors

21:44.607 --> 21:46.261
was trending right now.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.089
You know, we got so many bites.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.134
Yeah, and it's all about
social media, you know?

21:50.178 --> 21:53.094
Getting our name out there,
you know, and building a buzz.

21:53.137 --> 21:54.748
And balloons--
you know, thing is,

21:54.791 --> 21:56.358
people totally underestimate

21:56.402 --> 21:57.533
the power of balloons.

21:57.577 --> 21:58.882
- So, that's some gorilla, huh?

21:58.926 --> 22:00.493
- Yeah, you can see it
from the highway,

22:00.536 --> 22:02.233
really draws 'em in.

22:02.277 --> 22:03.496
- How much did it cost?

22:06.542 --> 22:10.372
- You can't really judge
these things by the numbers.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.418
- Right.

22:12.461 --> 22:15.029
- Trust me, I got it.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.552
It's going great.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.827
- Please don't be mad at me.

22:30.871 --> 22:33.134
- Okay.

22:33.177 --> 22:35.963
- I really messed up.

22:36.006 --> 22:38.269
Okay.

22:43.100 --> 22:46.365
- I mean, the man is made
of excuses.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.628
I mean, the first time
we almost went under,

22:48.671 --> 22:50.281
he blamed the housing crisis.

22:50.325 --> 22:52.371
- Wait, I thought it was 9/11.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.894
- You know what?

22:53.937 --> 22:55.635
You're right, he used that too.

22:55.678 --> 22:57.245
Yeah.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.421
And then, of course, there were
the California wildfires.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.944
You know,
"Nobody's buying cars."

23:00.988 --> 23:02.293
- In Detroit.
- Mm-mm.

23:02.337 --> 23:03.686
- Like, it literally made
no sense,

23:03.730 --> 23:05.122
and I fully bought it.

23:05.166 --> 23:07.255
- And Brexit? I mean...

23:07.298 --> 23:09.649
He never used Brexit.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.743
Why do I still want him
to have the answer?

23:16.786 --> 23:18.832
- Hmm...

23:18.875 --> 23:22.270
Because he's a man.

23:22.313 --> 23:24.272
- We really have to stop
doing that.

23:24.315 --> 23:28.798
- To be fair,
it's not entirely his fault.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.104
- That's, like,
the nicest thing

23:30.147 --> 23:31.497
you've ever said about him.

23:31.540 --> 23:35.065
- I mean, he's Dean.
He's Deansie.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.154
He's never gonna not be Dean.

23:37.198 --> 23:39.069
- He is what he is.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.115
- He's Dean.

23:42.986 --> 23:45.902
- I don't know
anything about cars.

23:45.946 --> 23:48.252
- I mean, I didn't know
anything about

23:48.296 --> 23:50.080
robbing a grocery store either.

24:35.169 --> 24:36.736
- ♪ Oui

24:38.389 --> 24:40.130
♪ Oh, oui, oh

24:43.090 --> 24:45.135
♪ Oui

24:51.620 --> 24:53.970
- What?
- I'm just surprised.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.232
- What, I can't take you
to dinner?

24:55.276 --> 24:56.538
- Are you kidding me?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.192
Yes, of course you can
take me out to dinner.

24:58.235 --> 25:00.194
This is--it's amazing.

25:02.718 --> 25:03.937
- Dean.

25:03.980 --> 25:07.593
Beth...

25:07.636 --> 25:10.857
- I think the dealership
could be great again.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.249
- Yeah, me too.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.034
- No, I mean, really great.

25:14.077 --> 25:16.427
- Yeah, sure, me too.

25:18.995 --> 25:20.910
- I have a few ideas.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.216
- Can I get you something
to drink?

25:22.259 --> 25:25.567
- Uh, we will take a look
at a wine list.

25:25.611 --> 25:26.786
- Perfect.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.833
- So, I was thinking today--
- Hold on a second.

25:30.877 --> 25:34.228
Excuse me, real quick.
What's your special tonight?

25:34.271 --> 25:36.970
- Fresh mussels cooked
in a white wine broth,

25:37.013 --> 25:38.711
served alongside grilled bread.

25:38.754 --> 25:40.451
- Ooh.
- Mmm.

25:40.495 --> 25:42.541
- Be right back with that list.
- Thank you.

25:44.630 --> 25:48.068
- So, I know you love
the sports car stuff...

25:48.111 --> 25:49.069
- Mm-hmm.

25:49.112 --> 25:51.027
- And that is fun and great,

25:51.071 --> 25:54.683
but I think that we're ignoring
51% of the population.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.598
- Special sounds good, right?
Yeah?

25:56.642 --> 25:58.600
- If we start catering
more towards women,

25:58.644 --> 26:00.733
I think we could really
increase our sales.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.735
We wouldn't have to reinvent
the wheel or anything,

26:02.778 --> 26:05.085
I mean, we could have
child care

26:05.128 --> 26:06.782
for when women are shopping.

26:06.826 --> 26:07.914
- Huh.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.132
- Could have a car seat guy

26:09.176 --> 26:11.221
come and do installs
on the lot.

26:11.265 --> 26:12.658
- Oh, look, they have
the barbecued short ribs.

26:12.701 --> 26:14.485
I don't think they had that
the last time we were--

26:14.529 --> 26:15.704
- Dean.

26:15.748 --> 26:18.054
- I'm sorry.
Sorry.

26:18.098 --> 26:21.144
Okay. Cater to women.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.278
- What do you think?

26:24.321 --> 26:27.150
- I think that you
were awesome this week.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.675
You killed it.
- Yeah?

26:29.718 --> 26:32.286
- I mean, you moved more cars
than our top guy, so...

26:32.329 --> 26:34.636
- Really?
- Yes, it was incredible.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.246
It was amazing.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.944
And the thing is,
I would never tell you

26:37.987 --> 26:41.556
how to raise the kids, right?

26:41.600 --> 26:44.472
Like, you--so, you make those
sandwiches,

26:44.515 --> 26:46.300
those cute, little sandwiches
with the face

26:46.343 --> 26:48.650
and the little olives, right?

26:48.694 --> 26:52.654
For eyes, and I think
that you use a cookie cutter.

26:52.698 --> 26:55.570
And I would never,
like, in a million years

26:55.614 --> 26:57.877
think about using a cookie
cutter for a sandwich.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.923
I think "cookie cutter"
and I just think "cookies."

27:00.967 --> 27:03.622
We are a great team.

27:05.014 --> 27:06.494
- Why's that?

27:06.537 --> 27:09.976
- Because we both have our own,
you know, superpower.

27:10.019 --> 27:13.501
Why would you wanna wreck that?

27:13.544 --> 27:18.593
Oh, hey, you wanna do, like,
a bottle of chard?

27:20.203 --> 27:22.553
- Bourbon on the rocks.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.210
- Next.

27:30.779 --> 27:34.130
- Ruby Hill, account number
four-six-eight-two-nine.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.697
- All right.

27:35.741 --> 27:38.221
It looks like you got
a partial payment due of...

27:41.398 --> 27:42.704
What's that?

27:42.748 --> 27:46.142
- My principal, my interest,
my service fees,

27:46.186 --> 27:51.408
my dignity, my happiness,
and my soul.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.210
You, sir, have a nice day.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.559
- I'll see you next month.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.256
- Oh, I won't be coming back.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.215
- Everyone comes back.

28:15.258 --> 28:17.130
- Everyone except me.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.653
- Whatever.

28:20.873 --> 28:22.875
- Get a good look, homie,
'cause you will

28:22.918 --> 28:25.138
never see this face again.

28:25.181 --> 28:28.707
- Okay. But I will.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.752
- But you won't.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.886
- I think I will.
- I know you won't.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.540
- Excuse me, are you finished?

28:38.673 --> 28:40.893
- How much?
- I'm sorry?

28:40.936 --> 28:42.503
- How much do you need?

28:42.546 --> 28:45.941
- Um, 200
for my son's prescription.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.464
- Happy birthday.

28:47.508 --> 28:50.337
- Thank you.
- Hey, no, you can't do that.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.339
- Watch me.

28:52.382 --> 28:54.080
Welcome to the bank of Ruby.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.429
Let me see what you got.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.387
I feel like this
should cover it.

28:57.431 --> 28:58.911
Happy Chanukah.

28:58.954 --> 28:59.955
- Hey, stop it.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.130
- How 'bout you?

29:01.174 --> 29:02.915
- No hablo Inglés.

29:02.958 --> 29:05.439
- Feliz Navidad.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.789
Gracias.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.530
- De nada.
I could do this all day!

29:09.573 --> 29:11.097
- No, you not gonna do it
all day.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.185
You better get up out of here!

29:12.228 --> 29:13.882
- Oh--did you want me to leave?

29:13.926 --> 29:16.276
- I don't ever wanna see you
back in here.

29:16.319 --> 29:18.278
- Deal.

29:20.671 --> 29:23.500
- Okay, so,
you're on auto-pay now.

29:23.544 --> 29:27.113
So they will just deduct
all your monthly expenses,

29:27.156 --> 29:28.636
you know, your cable
and your rent--

29:28.679 --> 29:30.638
- What about my permanents?

29:30.681 --> 29:33.293
- Well, I will make sure
that there's padding

29:33.336 --> 29:35.077
for a monthly salon visit--

29:35.121 --> 29:37.819
- I go weekly with Gladis
and the girls.

29:39.386 --> 29:42.215
- Weekly it is.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.913
Okay, here you go.

29:44.957 --> 29:48.482
And I will pick you up
bright and early.

29:48.525 --> 29:49.962
- What for now?

29:50.005 --> 29:51.093
- For the eye doc.

29:51.137 --> 29:52.399
- Do I have to?

29:52.442 --> 29:53.879
- Gotta get those cataracts
checked.

29:53.922 --> 29:56.272
- I really don't want
that surgery.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.361
- Girl, it's happening.

30:02.409 --> 30:05.020
- He was stealing from me,
wasn't he?

30:14.290 --> 30:16.466
- I'll see you tomorrow, Mer.

30:28.739 --> 30:31.307
So good.

30:31.351 --> 30:34.049
So you wanna--
you wanna go home?

30:36.095 --> 30:37.923
- No.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.474
- How'd you find this place?

31:09.955 --> 31:11.695
- A friend.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.567
- It is, like, super dope.

31:16.439 --> 31:17.745
I'm gonna get one more.

31:17.788 --> 31:20.922
Hi, can I just grab
a--another...

31:22.532 --> 31:24.926
Hi, excuse me.
Hi, can I get, um...

31:28.538 --> 31:31.106
Excuse me, miss?
Just need a...

31:33.717 --> 31:37.069

a little professionalism.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.985
Hi, can I grab another...

31:40.028 --> 31:42.509
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, okay.

32:58.106 --> 33:01.892
- You can't see a thing
in here.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.284
- Mind if I stop
at the drugstore?

33:45.327 --> 33:46.720
- Not at all.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.907
- I'll just run in.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.735
- Sure.

34:24.497 --> 34:27.413
- Need anything?

34:27.456 --> 34:30.111
- Just detergent
and toothpaste.

34:37.901 --> 34:41.296
- You know, it's no fun
drinking alone.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.649
Nah, I'm lying, it kinda is.

34:46.693 --> 34:48.825
- Babe, I thought
we were saving that.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.740
- Oh, you want
a special occasion?

34:50.784 --> 34:53.526
All right, well, how 'bout...
your boy here

34:53.569 --> 34:56.268
is getting his job back
as mall security.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.531
- You hate that gig.
- Mm-hmm.

34:58.574 --> 35:01.664
And I'm gonna be hating it
part-time nights and weekends.

35:02.535 --> 35:03.797
- There's no way in hell.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.668
- No, no, no, don't kill
the vibe, woman.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.323
Drink.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.935

a mall cop again.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.419
- What is this?

35:20.161 --> 35:23.077
Wait, you paid
the whole thing off?

35:23.121 --> 35:24.992
- Sure did.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.515
- With what money?

35:26.559 --> 35:28.778
- I'll tell you later.

35:28.822 --> 35:30.476
- You rob a store?

35:30.519 --> 35:32.391
- I'll tell you tomorrow.

35:32.434 --> 35:33.653
- What did you do for it?

35:33.696 --> 35:36.177
- Don't kill the vibe. Drink.

35:59.853 --> 36:02.769
- Look, you think
you love my eyebrows,

36:02.812 --> 36:04.510
but that's just because
your wife

36:04.553 --> 36:06.729
plucked hers to death and now
she doesn't have any left.

36:06.773 --> 36:10.385
So, to you, they're, like,
this hot, exotic fantasy.

36:10.429 --> 36:13.867
But Greg, one day,
you're gonna wake up

36:13.910 --> 36:16.522

and they're not gonna be

36:16.565 --> 36:18.480
this hot, exotic fantasy.

36:18.524 --> 36:21.004
They're just gonna be eyebrows.

36:21.048 --> 36:24.660
Like, you won't even see 'em
on my face anymore.

36:26.358 --> 36:30.492
- Um...you still wanna go
get tacos?

36:33.278 --> 36:35.236
- We've been here before.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.195
You know, we know
how this ends.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.240
- How does it end?

36:39.284 --> 36:41.547
- Total carnage.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.289
- Probably.

36:44.332 --> 36:47.379
- Like "Scarface" level
carnage.
