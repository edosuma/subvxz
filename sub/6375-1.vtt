WEBVTT

00:01.074 --> 00:02.666
<i>Last season on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:02.776 --> 00:03.969
He says his name is Daniel.

00:04.077 --> 00:05.408
You are his father.

00:05.879 --> 00:07.403
<i>She has a crush
on my gym teacher.</i>

00:07.514 --> 00:08.606
You're telling me that you're married?

00:08.715 --> 00:11.683
I just wanted you to know,
because I feel like I'm falling for you.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.877
Why did I agree to have
Wilhelmina's baby?

00:13.953 --> 00:15.648
Christina, you didn't have a choice.

00:15.955 --> 00:18.583
I'm going to start a magazine.

00:18.657 --> 00:20.887
<i>I'm going to call it, Hot Flash.</i>

00:20.960 --> 00:24.020
<i>You are no longer
Editor-in-Chief of Mode. I am.</i>

00:24.096 --> 00:25.256
How could you do this to me?

00:25.331 --> 00:28.697
<i>We'll find something else for you to do,
but Mode just isn't it.</i>

00:28.766 --> 00:29.824
Come to Rome with me.

00:29.901 --> 00:31.300
Yes! What?

00:31.602 --> 00:33.570
Will you marry me, Betty?

00:37.542 --> 00:40.978
I had a choice to make
between two guys,

00:41.079 --> 00:44.537
and I was torn. And then it hit me.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.907
Literally, a softball hit me.

00:47.617 --> 00:50.916
I'm sorry. You're so special to me.

00:50.988 --> 00:54.515
And as much as I love you,
I'm just not ready to marry you.

00:58.729 --> 01:02.858
I know how much you care about me,
and I care about you, too.

01:02.932 --> 01:04.593
But not in that way.

01:04.667 --> 01:08.262
And I feel like if I go to Rome with you,
I'm just gonna be leading you on.

01:09.405 --> 01:11.635
There's just so much
that I wanna experience

01:11.741 --> 01:14.574
before I settle into a relationship.

01:14.643 --> 01:17.009
For my life, my career...

01:18.180 --> 01:23.549
Mom, you never got the chance
to find out who you were without us.

01:24.219 --> 01:27.985
You sacrificed everything
so we would be happy,

01:28.056 --> 01:33.358
so I have to take this opportunity
and find out who I am

01:35.063 --> 01:36.621
by myself.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.795
I don't know what I'm gonna find,

01:45.072 --> 01:47.336
but I know where I can start.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.237
A place you always dreamt of going.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.942
I miss you.

02:00.953 --> 02:02.511
Wish me luck.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.920
<i>I hear a wind</i>

02:06.159 --> 02:09.060
<i>Whistling air</i>

02:09.762 --> 02:15.961
<i>Whispering in my ear</i>

02:20.405 --> 02:22.805
<i>Boy mercury</i>

02:23.275 --> 02:26.438
<i>Shooting through every degree</i>

02:27.312 --> 02:29.541
<i>Oh, girl, dancing down</i>

02:29.613 --> 02:33.014
<i>Those dirty and dusty trails</i>

02:34.618 --> 02:37.109
<i>Roam if you want to</i>

02:38.189 --> 02:41.124
<i>Roam around the world</i>

02:41.725 --> 02:44.250
<i>Roam if you want to</i>

02:45.129 --> 02:48.529
<i>Without anything but the love we feel</i>

02:48.631 --> 02:51.725
And this is me and Peggy
eating clam chowder in San Francisco.

02:51.835 --> 02:54.360
- That's a woman?
Yes, she's a woman.

02:54.471 --> 02:57.838
Peg and the girls were bike riding
cross-country. They were so inspiring.

02:57.907 --> 03:00.205
All of these women
had survived illnesses.

03:00.276 --> 03:02.301
<i>I can't wait to get back to Mode
and pitch their stories,</i>

03:02.378 --> 03:05.778
along with a lot of other ideas.

03:05.848 --> 03:08.146
This is my idea binder.

03:08.217 --> 03:09.582
I started it when I was on my trip

03:09.651 --> 03:12.449
because I have a lot to say
and a lot that I want to do,

03:12.521 --> 03:14.250
and I feel so empowered.

03:14.323 --> 03:16.814
Is that why you have this weird
blue thing around your neck?

03:16.892 --> 03:20.726
Well, yes. This weird blue thing
is my power animal. It's a dove.

03:20.796 --> 03:23.923
It represents the feminine energies
of peace and maturity.

03:24.031 --> 03:27.660
- Did Peg give you that?
- No, she said feminine energy.

03:27.768 --> 03:29.133
Okay, okay.

03:29.203 --> 03:31.501
The whole point is that
I came back with a plan.

03:31.572 --> 03:33.938
And I want Dad to hear this.
Where is he? Dad!

03:34.008 --> 03:35.407
Right here.

03:36.177 --> 03:38.736
Welcome to Flushing Burgers,
may I take your order?

03:38.812 --> 03:40.006
You got a job?

03:40.080 --> 03:43.174
<i>Welcome home, mi hija.
How was your trip?</i>

03:43.250 --> 03:45.582
Don't change the subject.
When did you get a job?

03:45.652 --> 03:47.051
Hey, you inspired me.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.054
When you made that big decision
to go on this trip,

03:49.122 --> 03:51.784
I thought maybe I should start cooking
somewhere other than this kitchen.

03:51.858 --> 03:53.223
I'm so proud of you.

03:53.293 --> 03:55.420
Sure feels good to be back
in the work force.

03:55.529 --> 03:56.495
And I like the cap.

03:56.595 --> 04:00.122
Yeah, it's... Sparkly.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.201
- Justin?
- I was trying to put the "you" in uniform.

04:04.270 --> 04:06.329
You're gonna get me in trouble.
Now fix it.

04:06.405 --> 04:08.396
<i>- No. I think it's sparkling...
- Are you kidding me, papi?</i>

04:08.474 --> 04:10.465
Don't be on his side. Put it back.

04:10.543 --> 04:11.942
Guys!

04:12.778 --> 04:15.678
I have created a plan for myself,
and I'm very eager to share it with you,

04:15.747 --> 04:17.374
so fasten your seatbelts.

04:17.447 --> 04:20.713
Number one, I am going take
on more responsibility at work

04:20.785 --> 04:23.310
so that, within a year, I get a promotion.

04:24.556 --> 04:28.287
Number two, I'm not going to let any
romantic entanglements get in my way.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.960
And then finally, number three,

04:32.863 --> 04:35.730
I'm getting my own apartment
in the city.

04:42.039 --> 04:46.339
Dad, slow down. Come on.
Dad, say something, please.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.536
<i>Mi hija, how can you afford
an apartment in Manhattan?</i>

04:48.611 --> 04:51.546
I've been saving up,
and I'm really good with money.

04:51.614 --> 04:53.514
I know it's not gonna be cheap,
but I can do it.

04:53.583 --> 04:54.777
I don't think you're ready.

04:54.850 --> 04:58.251
I am ready, Dad,
and this trip has helped me grow up.

04:58.321 --> 05:00.516
Look, Betty, life isn't easy.
You know that,

05:00.590 --> 05:03.115
but you don't really know it
until you start experiencing things.

05:03.226 --> 05:06.854
Yes. Experiencing things,
that's the whole point. You see?

05:06.962 --> 05:09.863
Look, you come back with all this talk
about change and growing up

05:09.931 --> 05:12.491
and it just makes you sound...

05:13.635 --> 05:15.432
What? It makes me sound what?

05:16.471 --> 05:19.031
Well, a little naive.

05:20.008 --> 05:21.771
- Naive?
- Yeah.

05:22.911 --> 05:25.174
Well, I'm glad I have your support.

05:25.246 --> 05:26.577
Betty...

05:28.000 --> 05:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:37.258 --> 05:40.091
- Morning, Kim.
- That's your daughter?

05:40.160 --> 05:42.627
<i>The one that works at Mode
and went on that big trip?</i>

05:42.729 --> 05:44.356
Yeah, Betty.

05:44.430 --> 05:48.025
And now she's even planning on
getting an apartment in the city.

05:48.101 --> 05:50.569
Okay, Jose.
We don't get paid to chit-chat.

05:50.637 --> 05:52.332
Corporate's been all up in my grill
about hygiene,

05:52.405 --> 05:54.396
so get your gloves on
and clean those nasty toilets.

05:54.474 --> 05:56.237
But I thought I was on fryer today.

05:56.309 --> 05:59.072
Change of plan.
Urinal cakes in the back.

06:04.716 --> 06:08.083
<i>Okay, Mode, get ready for Betty.</i>

06:20.564 --> 06:22.794
<i>Thank you for calling
the new Mode magazine,</i>

06:22.867 --> 06:25.199
how may I direct your call?

06:25.269 --> 06:26.827
Please hold.

06:27.405 --> 06:30.704
<i>Welcome to the new Mode magazine,
how may I direct your call?</i>

06:30.775 --> 06:32.367
Amanda.

06:32.443 --> 06:35.206
Oh, my God.

06:35.278 --> 06:40.477
Oh, my God. Betty.
I forgot how big and bright you are.

06:40.550 --> 06:44.543
- What are you doing here?
- I work here. My God, it's freezing.

06:45.689 --> 06:48.385
She likes it that way.
It keeps everyone sharp.

06:48.458 --> 06:49.482
- She?
Mandy.

06:49.592 --> 06:51.718
I'm looking out for you,
but you gotta look busy,

06:51.794 --> 06:54.524
even if you're doing nothing,
which is one of your strengths.

06:54.596 --> 06:56.723
Hey, Betty. Betty!

06:56.799 --> 06:59.893
Oh, my God.
Is it real? Am I hallucinating?

06:59.968 --> 07:04.132
- Marc, stop touching me.
- It is real. Betty. Betty...

07:04.173 --> 07:07.437
- Like a long-lost teddy bear.
- Furry...

07:07.475 --> 07:09.238
Why are you guys
being so nice to me?

07:09.310 --> 07:10.834
Because you remind us
of the good old days

07:10.912 --> 07:13.346
when you were here
and you'd say something weird,

07:13.414 --> 07:15.075
or wear something hideous.

07:15.183 --> 07:17.617
Like that thing around your neck.

07:17.685 --> 07:19.152
There's so many things
we could say about that.

07:19.220 --> 07:20.346
So many.

07:20.455 --> 07:23.253
Well, I'm back.
So you'll have plenty of time.

07:25.859 --> 07:27.486
Manolo Blahniks, Fall 2008.

07:27.561 --> 07:30.758
Only one person in these offices
wears those shoes.

07:30.831 --> 07:31.991
Everyone look busy!

07:35.469 --> 07:36.595
What?

07:36.670 --> 07:38.467
<i>Welcome to the new Mode magazine.</i>

07:42.375 --> 07:43.569
Daniel?

08:03.595 --> 08:04.527
No, no. Must I do everything myself?

09:15.596 --> 09:17.996
So we're working here now?

09:18.065 --> 09:19.828
Yeah, Alexis and Wilhelmina
pushed me out.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.390
This is where I landed.

09:21.469 --> 09:25.405
<i>But, Daniel, isn't Player a little smutty?</i>

09:25.473 --> 09:29.431
This is the third best-selling, no-nudity
men's magazine in the country.

09:29.542 --> 09:33.137
And it's so much more my speed.
I mean, don't I look more relaxed?

09:33.246 --> 09:38.684
Totally relaxed.
Is that a mustache you're growing?

09:38.751 --> 09:40.480
It's cool, huh?

09:40.553 --> 09:43.784
Betty, come on.
I swear it's so much better this way.

09:43.857 --> 09:45.323
I still own my third of Meade,

09:45.390 --> 09:48.587
but now I'm in charge of a magazine
that actually speaks to me.

09:48.660 --> 09:51.254
Look at this. You know what it says?

09:51.864 --> 09:52.888
"Beer Blast"?

09:52.965 --> 09:57.493
No. It says, "Cut down on your hours.
Spend more time with your son. "

09:57.569 --> 09:59.196
You know, I'm starting to learn French.

09:59.271 --> 10:01.398
DJ's been learning English
from late-night TV.

10:01.506 --> 10:04.202
Daniel, I've been gone
for almost a month.

10:04.308 --> 10:07.709
You couldn't have called me and told
me that any of this was happening?

10:07.778 --> 10:11.646
I did. Ginger, how many messages
did we leave on Betty's cell phone?

10:11.716 --> 10:12.876
A lot.

10:12.950 --> 10:15.248
What number were you calling?

10:17.755 --> 10:20.314
This is six numbers and the letter "P."

10:20.390 --> 10:21.948
I'm pretty sure that's right.

10:22.025 --> 10:24.016
Well... Hey, I want you
to meet the gang.

10:24.094 --> 10:25.891
Come on.
Everyone, let's gather around.

10:25.962 --> 10:28.123
There's someone I want you to meet.

10:28.198 --> 10:31.065
Everyone, this is my assistant, Betty.

10:33.336 --> 10:34.462
Why are they booing me?

10:34.538 --> 10:37.005
It's all in fun. They boo everyone.

10:39.441 --> 10:41.204
Is this your biatch?

10:41.277 --> 10:44.337
It's okay.
That's code name for "assistant. "

10:44.413 --> 10:47.610
- So how was your trip?
- It was amazing.

10:47.683 --> 10:50.982
I'm so excited to be back and take
some more responsibility at work,

10:51.053 --> 10:55.079
<i>but I kind of thought
that we would be doing that at Mode.</i>

10:55.156 --> 10:57.556
Well, you can do all that here.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.354
Okay, yeah.

10:59.427 --> 11:01.691
- Great.
- Okay.

11:01.763 --> 11:04.288
Daniel, wait.
What should I get started on?

11:04.365 --> 11:08.426
Anything you like. Just have fun.
Ginger, show her the lay of the land.

11:09.904 --> 11:12.770
I was once voted the Lay of the Land.

11:17.644 --> 11:20.909
Love your perfume, Claire. Musky.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.949
Bite me, Wilhelmina.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.283
Alexis.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.555
<i>So, I'm confused. Is this the budget
for the new Mode launch,</i>

11:30.623 --> 11:32.488
<i>or the next Harry Potter film?</i>

11:32.558 --> 11:35.584
I know the marketing numbers
are a teensy bit high,

11:35.661 --> 11:37.754
<i>but we are pulling Mode
out of a dark cloud.</i>

11:37.830 --> 11:39.058
Meaning my brother?

11:39.131 --> 11:41.793
Well, I didn't want to say anything,

11:41.901 --> 11:45.462
but this magazine was barely
scraping by when Daniel was here.

11:45.571 --> 11:50.098
<i>This is our opportunity to get the word
out that Mode is new and improved.</i>

11:50.208 --> 11:51.732
I can't do it.

11:51.843 --> 11:55.335
Alexis, darling,
we need the splashy ads,

11:55.413 --> 11:57.176
the giant billboard in Times Square.

11:57.248 --> 11:59.716
<i>The giant billboard
belongs to Hot Flash.</i>

11:59.784 --> 12:00.842
That sinking ship?

12:00.919 --> 12:02.750
Exactly why it needs a billboard.

12:02.821 --> 12:05.948
<i>You already have a name brand
to work with. Hot Flash doesn't.</i>

12:06.023 --> 12:08.821
I'm sorry, Wilhelmina.
I'm cutting you off.

12:10.394 --> 12:14.728
Wait... You're cutting me off?
You're cutting me off?

12:14.798 --> 12:16.595
Hold it in. Hold it in.
Hold it in. Hold it in.

12:16.700 --> 12:20.363
Think Wilhelmina's favorite things,
macaroons, Sade, Karl Rove.

12:20.471 --> 12:22.529
Hold it in. Hold it in.
Here we go, here we go.

12:22.639 --> 12:24.573
Out, out, out, out.

12:35.585 --> 12:39.179
Willie, are you okay?
Say something, damn it.

12:39.254 --> 12:41.814
Do you want me to slap you? Okay.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.653
That won't be necessary.

12:45.727 --> 12:49.720
That sinking ship is going
to throw us a life preserver.

12:52.167 --> 12:55.432
This is the year I was supposed
to take on more, get ahead.

12:55.503 --> 12:56.868
Daniel's got me doing nothing.

12:56.937 --> 12:59.770
<i>So maybe Player magazine isn't
quite what you expected,</i>

12:59.840 --> 13:01.637
<i>but neither was Mode
when you started.</i>

13:01.709 --> 13:03.040
You made that work.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.578
I guess you're right. Oh! There it is.

13:05.646 --> 13:07.944
Thank God for that.
I'm freaking starving.

13:08.015 --> 13:11.314
Although, a fair warning,
falafel sort of makes me a bit gassy.

13:11.385 --> 13:14.080
What? I'm a pregnant woman. I can
get away with saying things like that.

13:14.154 --> 13:17.223
- Christina, we're not eating. Look...
- What?

13:17.223 --> 13:20.750
The next step in my plan,
get an apartment in the city.

13:24.864 --> 13:27.697
Okay, well,
we didn't even make it upstairs.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.257
You'll see it next time.

13:29.369 --> 13:30.630
Really?

13:31.270 --> 13:33.238
Your dad pulling any more
all-day shifts this week?

13:33.305 --> 13:35.899
<i>I don't know.
Work's been kind of... Papi!</i>

13:35.974 --> 13:36.998
What...

13:41.580 --> 13:44.174
- That's not funny.
- Sorry.

13:46.185 --> 13:48.379
- Okay, maybe that's a little funny.
- Okay.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.786
- But don't do that again.
- I won't, I promise.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.356
Okay, what is that?

13:59.130 --> 14:01.098
That's my wife's ringtone.

14:02.834 --> 14:03.801
Oh.

14:05.836 --> 14:08.737
Look, maybe we should talk
about things...

14:08.805 --> 14:11.774
- No, no. I don't want to talk about it.
- Yeah, and where we're going, and...

14:11.842 --> 14:13.002
Hilda...

14:15.212 --> 14:20.149
I love being with you. I do. I haven't felt
this way in such a long time.

14:20.217 --> 14:23.549
You know, I went through something
that was really hard,

14:23.619 --> 14:26.520
and I just... I just...
I just wanna be happy.

14:26.589 --> 14:28.420
I don't wanna think about the future.

14:28.491 --> 14:31.790
Yeah, but the future could be
amazing between us.

14:31.894 --> 14:33.953
I told you how bad things are with her.

14:34.063 --> 14:37.396
We got married when we were both 20.
We're not the same people anymore.

14:37.466 --> 14:39.457
We both know it's over.

14:50.945 --> 14:55.746
Oh, my God. It's yellow. It's perfect.

14:55.817 --> 14:57.408
Betty, no, you don't want
to say that too loud.

14:57.484 --> 15:00.214
Someone else might want it.
Too bad about the murder

15:00.354 --> 15:02.185
that happened in the apartment,
though, eh?

15:02.222 --> 15:05.487
One bedroom, it's pet friendly,
close to all trains,

15:05.592 --> 15:07.059
tiled bathrooms, plenty of closets...

15:07.161 --> 15:08.992
Look at the price.
A bit expensive, though, isn't it?

15:09.062 --> 15:11.758
Yeah, I know, but maybe
I could eat ramen twice a week,

15:11.832 --> 15:13.322
or do some more overtime.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.094
It would be a challenge.

15:15.168 --> 15:16.533
I'm ready for that.

15:16.602 --> 15:19.537
That's what my trip taught me,
I can take any challenge head-on.

15:19.605 --> 15:20.594
And that I...

15:22.441 --> 15:25.308
Oh, my God, Christina, look.
It's my power animal.

15:25.378 --> 15:29.715
- It's a pigeon.
- It's a sign.

15:33.585 --> 15:35.246
I have to do this.

15:35.987 --> 15:38.080
I'm meant to do this.
Christina, I have to do this.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.055
Okay, Betty. If you think
you really want to do it,

15:40.125 --> 15:41.888
you've gotta go straight over
to that real estate agent

15:41.960 --> 15:44.224
and you've gotta tell her
you want this apartment right now.

15:44.296 --> 15:47.365
Okay. Yes, I will. I'll take it.

15:47.365 --> 15:48.559
I'll take it.

15:48.633 --> 15:50.725
What? No, no, no...

15:50.801 --> 15:54.498
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but this
apartment is supposed to be mine.

15:54.572 --> 15:57.439
I mean, you can't just give it away
like that. Can you?

15:57.508 --> 16:00.136
Welcome to the Big Apple.
You want a place, you have to act fast.

16:00.277 --> 16:01.801
Seriously? That fast?

16:01.846 --> 16:04.679
- It's a gut thing, honey.
- I have a gut.

16:05.316 --> 16:09.911
I mean, I'm ready. I'm ready for this.
I just... I just need an apartment.

16:11.154 --> 16:14.715
You must have some other places
that you could show me.

16:15.825 --> 16:18.760
Well, there's something else
in this building.

16:18.828 --> 16:20.455
Hasn't come on the market yet.

16:20.530 --> 16:22.191
Okay. Is it nice?

16:22.265 --> 16:24.755
Exactly like this one.
But a higher floor, so even better.

16:24.833 --> 16:25.390
- Sexy views.
- That sounds amazing. Can I see it?

17:36.134 --> 17:37.692
I don't understand.

17:37.769 --> 17:41.330
It was supposed to look exactly
like the other apartment I saw.

17:41.406 --> 17:44.569
Whoa, wait a minute.
You didn't see it before you rented it?

17:44.642 --> 17:48.043
- It was occupied.
- By a corpse?

17:48.112 --> 17:52.480
It's okay. It's okay. It just...
It needs a little TLC.

17:55.886 --> 17:57.114
You know what?

17:57.187 --> 17:59.985
The real estate agent said that
it had sexy views.

18:00.123 --> 18:01.249
Okay.

18:06.229 --> 18:09.561
That is not sexy. Or sanitary.

18:09.632 --> 18:15.571
How much money
did you put into all of this?

18:15.571 --> 18:16.902
Betty?

18:17.740 --> 18:20.903
Everything. My entire savings account.

18:20.977 --> 18:23.070
I can't believe this!

18:23.179 --> 18:26.636
That is the stupidest,
most irresponsible...

18:26.748 --> 18:29.683
<i>You know papi is not making a lot,
and my salon is not doing that great,</i>

18:29.751 --> 18:32.720
- and with the cost of gas these days...
- You don't have a car.

18:32.787 --> 18:34.084
You know what I'm saying.

18:34.155 --> 18:38.592
We are struggling as it is and you
throw all your money away on this?

18:39.427 --> 18:41.759
- I can fix this.
- How?

18:41.830 --> 18:46.323
<i>How are you gonna fix this?
I'm calling papi.</i>

18:47.134 --> 18:49.728
What? Hilda.
No, no, no, no. Don't you dare.

18:49.803 --> 18:50.827
- Hilda, give me that.
- Why?

18:50.904 --> 18:52.701
- Just give me the phone.
- Get off.

18:52.773 --> 18:55.173
Just let me fix this on my own.

18:58.979 --> 19:00.879
I mean, she never let me
see the apartment.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.811
That was a little tricky, don't you think?

19:02.882 --> 19:05.851
Okay, call me back.
Betty Suarez, 5G, thank you.

19:05.918 --> 19:07.408
What's going on?

19:07.487 --> 19:11.446
I got an apartment. But it's a disaster.
I'm working on it.

19:11.524 --> 19:14.357
Why don't you come into
the conference room for a minute?

19:18.730 --> 19:20.220
I'm stuck.

19:21.433 --> 19:24.630
DJ, you put the glue on my seat.
Ha, ha!

19:24.770 --> 19:26.829
Very funny. Daniel.

19:26.905 --> 19:29.373
What? Come on.
He's being a kid. It's funny.

19:29.474 --> 19:32.500
Look, this'll make you feel better.
I promise.

19:35.846 --> 19:38.474
Come on, you can't just boo people.

19:44.855 --> 19:48.621
I got great news for you.
I showed Uno here your idea binder.

19:48.692 --> 19:49.989
Awesome stuff.

19:50.061 --> 19:52.154
I really dug those victim chicks
on wheels.

19:52.229 --> 19:53.820
Wow. Really?

19:53.897 --> 19:56.422
And it inspired our fall cover.

19:56.499 --> 20:00.128
Shut up. Strong women
bicycling across the country?

20:00.270 --> 20:03.762
Actually, it's gonna be
six hot girls on motorcycles

20:03.807 --> 20:07.368
riding through the biggest party towns
in our country.

20:08.778 --> 20:10.608
But that's not my idea.

20:10.679 --> 20:13.341
See, we don't like disease.

20:15.484 --> 20:16.883
Or old women.

20:18.153 --> 20:19.848
Uno, they're 40.

20:21.757 --> 20:23.987
Betty, there's a perfect tie-in, okay?

20:24.059 --> 20:26.425
Harley show in Brooklyn tomorrow.

20:26.495 --> 20:31.022
<i>We're gonna introduce
"The Biker Chicks of Player. "</i>

20:31.099 --> 20:33.033
And because it was
your original concept,

20:33.101 --> 20:35.865
I think you should head up the event.

20:35.970 --> 20:37.904
Betty, you asked
for more responsibility.

20:37.972 --> 20:41.135
This is gonna open up
a whole new market for us.

20:43.644 --> 20:45.440
Fine. Yes. Okay.

20:51.952 --> 20:56.184
I said gingham, and you give me
Japanese floral garden kimonos?

20:56.256 --> 20:57.814
More like ki-no-nos.

20:57.891 --> 21:02.089
And dragon prints, Margaret, really?
Dragon prints? After all these years?

21:02.162 --> 21:05.597
And thank you, Rodrigo, for the gift
of whiteface kabuki makeup.

21:05.664 --> 21:07.461
You really put the "gay" in geisha.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.524
You should all kill yourselves.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.799
<i>This is the most important issue
of Mode ever, people.</i>

21:12.905 --> 21:15.874
Come back with something fresh,
or don't bother coming back at all.

22:31.512 --> 22:32.672
Yep.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.381
No, I totally understand.
It's just it's not fair

22:36.450 --> 22:39.078
because I didn't know
that was the apartment I was getting.

22:39.153 --> 22:41.178
"L," you're on the Sportster model.
Can you trade places?

22:41.255 --> 22:44.281
Well, could I at least get
my money back?

22:44.358 --> 22:46.792
Could you put your hair up,
so we can see the letter more clearly?

22:46.860 --> 22:48.156
No, not you. I can't see your hair.

22:48.228 --> 22:51.297
But you know what?
I'm sure it looks great.

22:51.297 --> 22:53.788
Okay. Look, could you
just send somebody

22:53.900 --> 22:57.131
to fix it up or to clean it or something?

22:57.203 --> 23:01.071
Really? What time? Yes.
Okay, I'll be there. Today, okay. Bye.

23:01.207 --> 23:02.538
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:02.609 --> 23:03.633
What are you two doing here?

23:03.710 --> 23:05.768
Marc wanted to see
all the girls in bikinis.

23:06.912 --> 23:08.311
Actually, we heard
you were going to be here.

23:08.380 --> 23:09.404
And we just know you're going to do

23:09.481 --> 23:11.142
something amazingly awful
and embarrassing.

23:11.216 --> 23:13.810
And we wanted to see it happen.
You know, for old times' sake.

23:13.885 --> 23:17.252
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but nothing is going to happen.

23:17.322 --> 23:19.085
So if you will excuse me...

23:23.628 --> 23:24.856
DJ.

23:26.197 --> 23:27.221
- Daniel.
- Come on,

23:27.331 --> 23:29.356
it's just Silly String,
it's not broken glass.

23:29.467 --> 23:31.128
You gotta learn to laugh at yourself.

23:31.202 --> 23:34.603
- Should he even be here?
- Why not?

23:34.672 --> 23:37.163
Look, I'm gonna be a cool dad.
I don't want to be like my father.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.799
Well, you don't have
to be like your father,

23:38.876 --> 23:40.968
but he did come here
looking for a father.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.477
So some boundaries wouldn't hurt.

23:42.545 --> 23:44.911
Betty. Betty. Betty. Betty.

23:44.981 --> 23:49.077
Major 411.
Or is it 911 that's emergency?

23:49.152 --> 23:52.519
I always get those confused.
Anyway, we just lost "R."

23:52.589 --> 23:56.650
<i>- What?
- The "R" girl. To spell Player.</i>

23:56.760 --> 24:00.354
DJ sprayed Silly String in her eyes and
she got all freaked out and went home

24:00.529 --> 24:01.689
and now we're a girl short.

24:01.730 --> 24:03.630
<i>Okay, hogs and heifers,</i>

24:03.699 --> 24:06.497
<i>get ready as we launch
the Player Girls...</i>

24:06.568 --> 24:08.502
Okay, let me think.
What should we do?

24:08.604 --> 24:11.198
Daniel, I'll figure this out,
it's my responsibility.

24:11.273 --> 24:13.264
You take care of DJ.

24:17.612 --> 24:20.740
We're back now
with Wilhelmina and Alexis.

24:20.815 --> 24:22.476
So nice to have you here.

24:22.550 --> 24:24.484
It is such an honor to be at the helm

24:24.552 --> 24:27.248
<i>as we re-launch
the new and improved Mode.</i>

24:27.322 --> 24:29.347
And Wilhelmina is doing a great job.

24:29.457 --> 24:32.220
We should mention, for the people
in our audience who don't know,

24:32.326 --> 24:36.194
<i>Wilhelmina took over Mode
from Alexis' brother, Daniel Meade.</i>

24:36.263 --> 24:37.252
So what's the deal with that?

24:37.364 --> 24:39.662
What kind of a show
are you running over there, Alexis?

24:41.435 --> 24:44.461
Daniel just decided to work...

24:44.538 --> 24:47.268
Where his skills
would be better utilized.

24:47.341 --> 24:49.501
<i>Tell us about this new magazine,
Hot Flash.</i>

24:49.575 --> 24:52.806
Is that what this is?
I thought it was some kind of joke.

24:52.878 --> 24:54.641
It's my mother's pet project.

24:54.714 --> 24:56.648
<i>Hot Flash, I just got it.</i>

24:56.716 --> 25:00.345
It's like menopause.
It's a magazine about lady business.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.983
I know it's real, but I don't
necessarily want to read about it.

25:05.091 --> 25:06.921
Oh, my God. Look at this.

25:06.991 --> 25:10.893
"Brittle and horny? Afraid your bones
will crack in the sack?"

25:11.996 --> 25:14.294
Been there, done that. Yeah.

25:20.638 --> 25:23.607
<i>"P." Come on.</i>

25:23.675 --> 25:28.771
<i>"L," "A," "Y"...</i>

25:28.846 --> 25:32.646
<i>All right, you can do this.
You can do anything.</i>

25:32.716 --> 25:37.676
<i>You're a dove, a kick-ass dove,
just facing another challenge.</i>

25:37.788 --> 25:39.949
<i>It's like a bike, just bigger.</i>

25:40.057 --> 25:41.182
Betty.

25:48.331 --> 25:49.730
<i>"R."</i>

25:52.101 --> 25:53.261
Look out!

25:53.336 --> 25:55.099
Oh, my God!

25:55.171 --> 25:56.502
Careful.

25:59.908 --> 26:02.968
I'm okay.
- Beyond my wildest dreams.

26:03.011 --> 26:05.275
- Magic.
- Call 411.

26:05.547 --> 26:08.641
I can't believe they criticized
one of our magazines that way.

26:08.717 --> 26:12.175
I wonder whether that reaction was
just the tip of the iceberg.

26:12.254 --> 26:13.881
Have you seen the latest sales figures?

26:13.989 --> 26:17.091
I know, but I think
it has long-term potential.

26:17.091 --> 26:19.423
And it's my mother's dream.

26:19.493 --> 26:21.051
I had a thought.

26:21.128 --> 26:24.564
<i>A way of stopping the bleeding
and helping Mode.</i>

26:26.801 --> 26:28.701
Look, I've had
a really rough day

26:28.769 --> 26:31.863
and I'm still waiting for that handyman.

26:32.573 --> 26:38.340
A couple minutes. Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I... I can wait. Thanks.

26:44.617 --> 26:47.279
<i>Thank you
for calling. Our offices are now closed.</i>

26:47.387 --> 26:49.514
What? No.

27:09.907 --> 27:11.898
No, no, no, no, no.

27:29.192 --> 27:31.558
No, no, no, no, no. Don't do that.

27:31.628 --> 27:34.062
No, stop. You're my power animal.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.367
- Hello, Kimmie.
- Long time no see, Betty.

28:50.436 --> 28:52.063
So you're the manager here?

28:52.138 --> 28:56.733
Actually, it's "On-Site Senior Executive
in Charge of Food Operations. "

28:58.543 --> 29:02.479
Well, then, I guess you're exactly
the person I need to talk to.

29:02.581 --> 29:07.883
You see, it seems that you have cut
back my father's hours recently.

29:07.953 --> 29:10.614
Yeah, pretty much. He's a slacker.

29:10.688 --> 29:14.784
No, he's not.
He's a very hard-working, good person.

29:15.926 --> 29:18.986
Then he must just be getting old.
I mean, how old is he? Like, 100?

29:19.063 --> 29:20.655
Just say the word, Betty.

29:20.731 --> 29:22.892
- Take it back.
- Nope.

29:23.500 --> 29:27.334
All right, Kimmie, don't push me.
I have had a very hard day,

29:27.404 --> 29:29.997
and you have no idea
what I am capable of.

29:30.106 --> 29:34.133
Well, I'm not a cheeseburger,
so I know you're not gonna eat me.

29:36.346 --> 29:41.147
- Oh, no, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. And it felt good.

29:41.217 --> 29:43.845
No. What are you doing? No.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.216
Sorry.

29:47.689 --> 29:51.523
That's it. That is it.
You are going down, bitch.

29:52.661 --> 29:54.492
Well, I guess if we all have to work late,

29:54.563 --> 29:57.191
we can at least enjoy
a little family dinner together, right?

29:57.265 --> 30:01.793
I can't believe the gall of
Regis and Kelly, spewing that garbage.

30:01.870 --> 30:04.895
<i>Hot Flash serves a growing
and diverse demographic.</i>

30:05.006 --> 30:07.941
We need a forum
to discuss aging, menopause,

30:08.009 --> 30:10.000
- personal dryness...
- Mom...

30:10.111 --> 30:12.579
<i>Actually, Mom, there is
something about Hot Flash</i>

30:12.680 --> 30:14.614
that we need to discuss.

30:14.682 --> 30:17.082
DJ, no cake, come on.

30:17.151 --> 30:19.085
<i>Hey, déjeuner first, then dessert, right?</i>

30:20.253 --> 30:21.720
No, come on.

30:22.455 --> 30:23.979
What are you... Give me the...

30:27.460 --> 30:30.429
Hey. That is not funny.
Apologize to your aunt right now.

30:30.497 --> 30:34.263
No, it's fine.
Chocolate on silk, that'll come out.

30:34.334 --> 30:37.427
What has gotten into you?
Finish your dinner.

30:39.905 --> 30:43.238
Fine, you're not hungry?
Go do your English homework.

30:43.308 --> 30:47.479
DJ, I'm not messing around.
Right now. Go.

30:47.479 --> 30:48.605
Now.

30:53.318 --> 30:56.047
Well, isn't this a lovely evening?

30:57.522 --> 30:58.955
Pig Latin.

31:00.191 --> 31:01.715
Dirty skank.

31:02.226 --> 31:03.386
Not the shake. Not the shake.

31:03.461 --> 31:06.328
You mean, mean person.

31:06.397 --> 31:10.265
- What is that? I don't even...
- It doesn't come naturally to everyone.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.663
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Enough.
You, you, get out.

31:14.771 --> 31:16.363
- She started it.
- It was her.

31:16.473 --> 31:18.907
Yeah, get out,
and tell your old man he's fired.

31:21.278 --> 31:23.212
Hey, let's go.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.976
How do you like me now, Ugly Betty?

31:31.454 --> 31:33.319
Any sign of him?

31:33.389 --> 31:35.687
He locked himself in there
and won't come out.

31:35.758 --> 31:37.988
I shouldn't have yelled at him.

31:38.327 --> 31:42.263
I used to hate Dad when
he yelled at me. I never got over it.

31:43.099 --> 31:44.259
And now my own kid hates me.

31:44.366 --> 31:47.562
He doesn't hate you, darling.
He's just testing you.

31:47.669 --> 31:51.105
Daniel, this boy has lost everything.
His mother, his home in France.

31:51.172 --> 31:54.471
You can yell at him,
you're going to have to sometimes.

31:54.542 --> 31:59.206
But as long as he knows you're going
to be there for him tomorrow, it's okay.

32:00.982 --> 32:03.780
Hello? Yes, this is Claire.

32:06.653 --> 32:07.847
What?

32:08.088 --> 32:11.023
<i>- You killed Hot Flash.
- I didn't kill it. I downsized it.</i>

32:11.091 --> 32:13.582
And I had to find out
from an assistant at the office.

32:13.660 --> 32:17.653
I was gonna tell you at dinner,
right before the cake attack.

32:17.765 --> 32:22.224
<i>Look, it makes economic sense to turn
Hot Flash into a quarterly or an insert.</i>

32:22.335 --> 32:26.203
- A flyer?
- An insert. Lots of magazines do this.

32:27.039 --> 32:29.837
You know, you think
you're the one making these decisions,

32:29.909 --> 32:32.309
but you're just doing
Wilhelmina's bidding.

32:32.378 --> 32:36.041
First she pushed your brother aside,
now my magazine.

32:37.083 --> 32:40.245
Pretty soon, it'll be you.

32:50.295 --> 32:51.853
Here you go, sweetie.

32:55.033 --> 32:56.897
I'm so sorry, Dad.

32:56.967 --> 33:00.596
Please. There are other jobs.
Better jobs.

33:02.706 --> 33:05.800
- What happened to you today?
- Everything.

33:05.876 --> 33:06.501
Everything happened to me today.
It's like I totally regressed.

34:21.982 --> 34:23.676
What do you want?

34:24.116 --> 34:26.380
I came to apologize.

34:26.452 --> 34:30.547
Look, I acted like a child yesterday.
I'm sorry.

34:30.656 --> 34:34.284
I guess I'm still upset over the way
you treated me in high school.

34:34.393 --> 34:36.418
You were such a bully.

34:36.527 --> 34:39.257
- Nice apology.
- Sorry.

34:40.599 --> 34:44.931
Look, Kimmie, I know you hate me,
but don't take it out on my dad.

34:45.003 --> 34:47.130
He really needs this job.

34:48.706 --> 34:52.072
I don't hate you. I'm just jealous.

34:52.877 --> 34:54.844
Wait, you're jealous of me?

34:54.913 --> 34:57.279
You've got an apartment in the city,
a great job,

34:57.348 --> 34:59.110
and your dad's all proud of you.

34:59.182 --> 35:02.083
Me? Everything went downhill
after high school.

35:02.152 --> 35:04.712
I mean, I'm working at this dump,
I still live at home,

35:04.821 --> 35:06.413
I've got a boyfriend that I kind of hate,

35:06.523 --> 35:08.787
and I'm tired all the time,
and I looked it up on the Internet,

35:08.859 --> 35:11.726
and I'm 98% sure
that I've got Lyme disease.

35:11.795 --> 35:15.753
Whatever you do, don't have sex
in the woods on Fire Island.

35:15.831 --> 35:17.128
I won't.

35:18.935 --> 35:23.770
Look, the worst part is, I just feel
like nothing's ever gonna change.

35:25.174 --> 35:26.436
Kimmie,

35:28.144 --> 35:33.206
look, there are so many days
where I feel exactly the same way.

35:33.281 --> 35:35.146
But it gets better.

35:35.216 --> 35:39.414
And it can for you, too. You just have
to be willing to do something about it.

35:39.521 --> 35:43.821
Take a leap.
Don't be afraid to fall flat on your face.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.918
Believe me, I do it every day.

35:52.700 --> 35:56.329
Well, I've got to get this place ready
before it opens.

35:58.105 --> 36:01.973
Hey, Betty, tell Ignacio
to be here at noon.

36:02.009 --> 36:03.772
He can have his job back?

36:03.811 --> 36:08.144
He's the best guy I've got on the fryer,
and I can't afford to lose him.

36:08.514 --> 36:11.415
Thank you. Thank you, Kimmie.

36:25.998 --> 36:30.594
Hey, I was waiting for you to come
out, but I guess I fell asleep.

36:39.277 --> 36:43.440
Listen, things between us,

36:44.815 --> 36:47.579
they're not always going to be great.

36:50.621 --> 36:54.216
But I'm your father, you are my son,

36:54.291 --> 36:56.623
and we're in this together.

37:00.363 --> 37:02.695
So even when I have to say no...

37:09.472 --> 37:11.133
I love you, too.

37:28.323 --> 37:30.257
Taste the watermelon.

37:30.325 --> 37:33.726
All right, okay, all right.
That's enough, this is not funny.

37:33.796 --> 37:35.626
You guys are acting
like a bunch of idiots.

37:35.696 --> 37:39.792
Actually, it's pretty funny.
And, yes, they are idiots,

37:39.867 --> 37:43.030
<i>which is exactly why you should put it
on the Player website</i>

37:43.104 --> 37:44.469
and then leak it online.

37:44.539 --> 37:46.507
- Betty, come on.
- No, I'm serious.

37:46.574 --> 37:48.940
You want to get more readers,
then appeal to your demographic,

37:49.043 --> 37:53.479
18 to 39-year-old male idiots
who respond to this type of humor.

37:55.215 --> 37:57.775
She's right. We do respond to that.

37:58.618 --> 38:00.586
I told you she was good.

38:03.623 --> 38:07.320
Okay, okay, okay.
I think I liked the booing better.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.272
What are you guys doing here?

38:30.381 --> 38:31.473
We figured you need some help.

38:31.583 --> 38:33.016
- Major.
- Hello.

38:34.185 --> 38:36.517
Sorry about the whistle,
but you scared me.

38:36.588 --> 38:41.082
That's so sweet, thank you. Thank you.

38:41.159 --> 38:42.524
Surprise.

38:43.695 --> 38:48.256
Listen, I am really sorry that
I was so hard on you the other day.

38:48.332 --> 38:52.098
'Cause you're my kid sister,
I'm so proud of you.

38:52.169 --> 38:54.034
You've accomplished so much,
and I just...

38:54.104 --> 38:56.004
I wish I could get
my crap together like you.

38:56.106 --> 38:59.075
Hilda, you have your crap together.

38:59.143 --> 39:01.736
You have the salon,
which is about to take off.

39:01.911 --> 39:04.311
And you found this perfect guy.

39:04.347 --> 39:06.941
Yeah, he's not that perfect.

39:06.983 --> 39:10.817
Really? Tell me one thing
that's not perfect about the coach.

39:11.821 --> 39:14.289
See? You can't even think of one.

39:15.057 --> 39:17.116
Oh, my gosh,
what are you making me?

39:17.193 --> 39:18.490
Curtains.

39:20.428 --> 39:22.487
My dame's on Broadway.

39:22.564 --> 39:24.088
You know I'm a triple threat.

39:24.166 --> 39:27.397
Yes, an editor, a diva,
and, well, a threat.

39:28.170 --> 39:30.161
Remind me to give Kelly Ripa
a gift basket.

39:30.238 --> 39:32.206
She really came through for us.

39:32.307 --> 39:34.901
She's as reliable as she is fertile.

39:53.761 --> 39:55.819
New York City. Check.

39:56.296 --> 39:58.662
"No more romantic entanglements. "

40:09.209 --> 40:10.676
Hello!

40:11.277 --> 40:12.868
Can we talk?

40:14.279 --> 40:15.473
Hi.

40:16.949 --> 40:18.974
- Hi.
- I'm sorry, was I playing too loud?

40:19.051 --> 40:21.281
'Cause I'm practicing
for a gig tomorrow.

40:21.353 --> 40:24.652
No, I mean, a little loud
but, you know, if you're practicing,

40:24.723 --> 40:28.124
then I could just wear ear plugs
or something.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.660
I'm your new neighbor, 5G.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.357
I'm glad you stopped by, actually.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.299
'Cause I think
this might've fallen out of your stuff.

40:37.401 --> 40:41.098
Oh, my God. I didn't even know
I'd lost this. Thank you so much.

40:41.205 --> 40:45.073
- It suits you.
- Yeah. I guess it does.

40:47.244 --> 40:48.575
Okay.

40:49.679 --> 40:50.805
- Thank you.
- Sure.

40:50.880 --> 40:55.010
- Wait, what does the "B" stand for?
- Oh, um... Betty.
