OK, QUEEN--
TELL THEM TO FOLLOW!

1:02:05.454 --> 1:02:07.288
TELL THEM TO FOLLOW!

1:02:38.361 --> 1:02:40.238
[BUZZING]

1:03:54.478 --> 1:03:55.731
GOOD DAY, SIR.

1:03:55.814 --> 1:03:56.940
C.T.?

1:03:57.023 --> 1:03:58.316
YES, SIR?

1:04:00.903 --> 1:04:02.153
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

1:04:02.236 --> 1:04:04.280
THAT WE'RE ALL VERY
PROUD OF YOU, C.T.

1:04:04.363 --> 1:04:05.908
YOU ARE?

1:04:05.990 --> 1:04:09.410
YOU'LL FIND THE REST
OF YOUR CLASS IN
THE AUDITORIUM.

1:04:09.493 --> 1:04:11.162
OH, UH,

1:04:11.245 --> 1:04:14.123
COULD I LEAVE THIS
FOR MISS RICHARDS
IN OUR ROOM?

1:04:14.207 --> 1:04:16.042
CERTAINLY. GO AHEAD.

1:04:39.148 --> 1:04:42.109
C.T., THE OTHERS ARE
IN THE AUDITORIUM.

1:04:44.445 --> 1:04:46.364
WHY, IS THAT
YOUR CATERPILLAR?

1:04:46.447 --> 1:04:48.449
THE ONE YOU'VE BEEN
DRAWING ALL WINTER?

1:04:48.532 --> 1:04:51.160
IT'S ALMOST READY
TO BE A BUTTERFLY.

1:04:51.244 --> 1:04:52.913
C.T., HOW WONDERFUL!

1:04:52.996 --> 1:04:54.998
I WAS SAVING IT
FOR TANYA.

1:04:55.081 --> 1:04:57.416
WOULD YOU LIKE IT,
MISS RICHARDS?

1:04:57.500 --> 1:04:59.002
WHY, C.T.,
I'D LOVE IT.

1:04:59.085 --> 1:05:00.294
WOULD IT BE
ALL RIGHT

1:05:00.378 --> 1:05:01.755
IF I SHARED THIS
WITH THE CLASS?

1:05:01.838 --> 1:05:02.881
SURE ENOUGH.

1:05:02.965 --> 1:05:04.298
FINE, YOU CALL
THE CLASS

1:05:04.382 --> 1:05:06.802
AND I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THINGS HERE.

1:05:06.885 --> 1:05:07.803
OH, C.T.?

1:05:07.886 --> 1:05:09.805
YES, MISS RICHARDS?

1:05:11.138 --> 1:05:13.016
I NEVER SAID
THANK YOU, DID I?

1:05:13.099 --> 1:05:15.018
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
MISS RICHARDS.

1:05:15.101 --> 1:05:18.104
I NEVER SAID
I WAS SORRY, EITHER.

1:05:27.030 --> 1:05:28.657
Jane: THINK OF IT--

1:05:28.740 --> 1:05:29.908
LAST SEPTEMBER HE WAS JUST
A LITTLE OLD CATERPILLAR,

1:05:29.992 --> 1:05:31.952
CRAWLING ALONG
ON THE GROUND.

1:05:32.035 --> 1:05:34.997
NOW HE'S COMING AWAKE
AFTER A LONG WINTER'S SLEEP.

1:05:35.079 --> 1:05:37.373
A BEAUTIFUL CHANGE
IS TAKING PLACE.

1:05:37.456 --> 1:05:40.002
HE'S BEING BORN
ALL OVER AGAIN.

1:05:40.084 --> 1:05:43.337
JUST AS YOU AND I WILL BE
BORN AGAIN SOMEDAY.

1:05:43.421 --> 1:05:46.340
AND EVERYONE WE'VE
EVER KNOWN OR LOVED.

1:05:46.424 --> 1:05:48.509
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'LL BE LIKE

1:05:48.592 --> 1:05:51.095
ANY MORE THAN
THE CATERPILLAR DID.

1:05:51.178 --> 1:05:53.306
AND SO, WHEN THE BUTTERFLY
SPREADS ITS WINGS

1:05:53.389 --> 1:05:55.017
AND FLIES AWAY,

1:05:55.099 --> 1:05:58.227
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT
WE'VE BEEN VERY LUCKY.

1:05:58.311 --> 1:06:01.732
FOR HERE TODAY WE HAVE
A WONDERFUL PROMISE
OF THINGS TO COME.

1:06:01.815 --> 1:06:03.482
Children: OOH!

1:06:05.401 --> 1:06:06.903
[EXCITED SHOUTS]

1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:21.292
YOU MUSTN'T!

1:06:21.375 --> 1:06:23.294
MR. WILLIAMS,
C.T. HIT ME!

1:06:23.377 --> 1:06:24.921
C.T. WAS RIGHT,
SARAHLENE.

1:06:25.005 --> 1:06:27.966
EVEN A BUTTERFLY
MUST HAVE ITS FREEDOM.

1:06:39.435 --> 1:06:42.856
I HOPE YOU BOTH HAVE
A PLEASANT VACATION.

1:06:53.784 --> 1:06:56.369
OH, MISS RICHARDS,

1:06:56.452 --> 1:06:57.746
YOU KNOW WHAT...

1:06:57.829 --> 1:06:59.372
WHAT, C.T.?

1:07:01.041 --> 1:07:02.918
I LOVE YOU.

1:07:29.069 --> 1:07:30.946
