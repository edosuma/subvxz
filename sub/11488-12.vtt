00:02.700 --> 00:04.300
I had a great dream
last night.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.000
Really?
Yeah.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.300
I dreamed I got locked
in a house made of donuts

00:08.300 --> 00:10.300
and I had to eat my way out.

00:11.700 --> 00:12.600
Interesting.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.600
I had a similar dream,
only no house and no donuts.

00:18.400 --> 00:19.200
Morning.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.300
Morning.
Morning.

00:20.800 --> 00:21.800
So, uh...

00:21.800 --> 00:23.200
how'd everybody sleep?

00:25.800 --> 00:27.800
Uncle Charlie and I
both had dreams about eating.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.000
Mine was with donuts.
His was something dirty.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.100
He's just guessing.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.200
Good guess.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.500
And yes, Alan, we
see your earring.

00:39.700 --> 00:40.800
It's pretty cool, right?

00:40.800 --> 00:44.000
Yeah, if you're going to a Wham!
concert with Molly Ringwald.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.600
I think it's cool.
Thank you, Jake.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.800
<i>Can I get my ear pierced?
No.</i>

00:50.800 --> 00:51.600
Why not?

00:51.600 --> 00:54.100
You can't keep
the holes you have clean.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.500
And you're too young.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.200
Wait till you're old, desperate,

00:58.200 --> 01:00.000
and living
in your brother's house.

01:00.500 --> 01:01.600
You can mock me all you want,

01:01.600 --> 01:04.099
but there's a certain lady
who thinks it's darn sexy.

01:04.099 --> 01:06.600
First of all, I don't need
permission to mock you...

01:07.200 --> 01:08.300
but more importantly,

01:08.300 --> 01:11.200
you let some broad talk you
into piercing your ear?

01:11.500 --> 01:14.500
Actually, my ear wasn't
her first choice to pierce.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.100
What else can you pierce?

01:20.700 --> 01:22.200
Nothing.
Nothing.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.700
Fine. Don't tell me.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.000
I'll Google it.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.100
Don't worry.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.800
He can't
spell "pierce."

01:29.700 --> 01:31.200
He can't spell "Google."

01:32.600 --> 01:35.500
So, who's Princess Poke-a-Hole?

01:36.100 --> 01:39.200
Just a nice young woman with
a sewing needle and a potato.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.700
A potato?

01:40.900 --> 01:42.600
Yeah, she, uh, she put it
behind my lobe,

01:42.600 --> 01:44.000
sort of like a pincushion.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Oh. So you're a moron.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.000
It's perfectly safe.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.100
She sterilized the needle.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.000
How?

01:50.300 --> 01:51.500
With alcohol.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.200
Okay, Kahlua.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.000
Well, I guess I owe morons
an apology.

02:00.700 --> 02:02.900
You do know that's the gay ear.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.100
What?

02:10.100 --> 02:13.000
Left ear says "I'm a hipster
from the disco era."

02:13.000 --> 02:13.800
Right ear says...

02:13.800 --> 02:15.300
(flamboyantly):
"Let's disco!"

02:20.200 --> 02:21.500
No, no,
th-th-that can't be right.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.200
Okay, don't believe me.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.900
Hey, look who's finally
out of the closet.

02:27.500 --> 02:37.500

02:49.000 --> 02:49.600
Berta.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.400
Yeah.
What are you doing?

02:51.800 --> 02:53.300
Making your bed.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.000
Well, I'd like
to take a nap.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.900
Hop in. You can spoon me,
but it ends there.

03:00.800 --> 03:01.800
Are you sick?

03:01.800 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, I'm sick.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.900
I'm sick of staying up all night
with a screaming baby

03:06.900 --> 03:10.900
while my daughter's out trolling
the waterfront for the father of her next one.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.400
Whoa, that's rough.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.300
Oh, don't feign interest
in my life, Charlie.

03:17.100 --> 03:19.200
Sorry, I, I, I see
a woman in my bed,

03:19.200 --> 03:21.100
I instinctively
start lying.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.800
Close the door on your way out.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.800
Okay.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.300
No.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.800
No, this is ridiculous.

03:35.900 --> 03:36.800
Berta.
Get out.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.900
Sleep tight.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.500
Hello? Ow!

03:46.900 --> 03:48.100
Uh, hello?

03:48.100 --> 03:49.600
Oh, oh, hi.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.900
Uh, no, no, it's, uh,
it's just a little tender.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.200
I'm glad you called.
I, I missed you, too.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.400
Yeah, yeah, last
night was fun.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.500
You won't believe
who's in my bed.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.100
Hang on.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.800
I never do...

04:04.200 --> 04:05.700
but I'm on the
phone right now.

04:06.400 --> 04:07.100
Ow!

04:07.100 --> 04:09.000
Ah... damn it.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.000
Uh, listen, how
about tonight?

04:11.400 --> 04:12.200
Oh, great, great.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.400
The usual place?

04:13.900 --> 04:14.900
All right, well,
see you then.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.000
(chuckles)
Okay. B-Bye.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.800
Berta's in my bed.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.100
Really?

04:22.100 --> 04:24.000
Couldn't you just pay her
in cash this week?

04:26.600 --> 04:27.800
Ow!

04:29.500 --> 04:31.700
There are some things
we don't joke about.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.400
Okay, so...

04:34.500 --> 04:36.100
why is Berta
in your bed?

04:37.100 --> 04:39.200
Apparently, her daughter's been
out partying every night

04:39.200 --> 04:40.800
and Berta's been stuck
with the baby.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.200
Oh, that's got to be rough.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.600
Don't feign interest
in her life, Alan.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.200
Sorry.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.400
Oh, hey, hey, listen,
can you watch Jake tonight?

04:50.400 --> 04:54.400
Why? You want to see if your
new lady friend can infect other parts of your body?

04:55.200 --> 04:58.100
It's not infected.A certain amount of swelling
is perfectly normal.

04:58.100 --> 04:59.200
Where'd it say that, Alan?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.300
On the potato?

05:05.100 --> 05:07.200
Are you at least going to
tell me who this woman is?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.500
It's nobody you know.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.800
Oh... so I know her.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.100
I didn't say that.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.400
You didn't have to.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.000
Now let's see.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.500
Who do I know that you'd
like to keep a secret?

05:19.500 --> 05:20.600
You're wasting your time.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.100
One of your ex-wives?

05:22.700 --> 05:24.800
Rose? Berta's
daughter?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.500
(laughing):
Berta's daughter?

05:29.200 --> 05:31.200
D-Don't be ridiculous.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.300
Ha... ha-ha.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.600
That's rich.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.000
Ha, ha, ha!

05:42.100 --> 05:43.600
* Men... *

05:44.600 --> 05:46.600
I'm tired.
Shouldn't I be in bed?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.200
Shut up and deal.

05:48.900 --> 05:51.400
Look, I'll give you back
the money I won.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.200
You didn't win it
till we stop playing.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.000
Now deal.

05:56.800 --> 05:57.700
What's he doing up?

05:57.700 --> 05:58.800
Not now, Alan.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.700
I'm all in.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.200
Jake, bed.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.000
Hold on, Dad. Call ya.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.600
Pocket aces.

06:06.900 --> 06:07.800
What do you got?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.700
You heard your father.
Go to bed.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.000
He's been betting
on garbage all night.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.800
You let a 12-year-old
beat you at poker?

06:17.500 --> 06:18.900
He's 12 and a half.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.800
What's going on
with your ear, Dumbo?

06:23.500 --> 06:24.900
It's just a little swelling.

06:24.900 --> 06:25.900
It's normal.

06:26.700 --> 06:29.700
You don't want to be
flying around in circles.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.400
It's fine.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.600
Listen, th-there's something
I need to get off my chest.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.600
If you don't see
a doctor soon,it'll be your earlobe.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.100
Are you going
to listen or what?
Sorry.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.500
I'm all ears.
No, wait, that's you.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.300
You know what? Forget about it.

06:44.300 --> 06:46.200
No, no, no, no,
come on. Talk to me.
(sighs)

06:47.100 --> 06:48.300
It's about the girl I'm dating.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.300
Berta's daughter.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.400
How didyou know?

06:52.100 --> 06:54.100
Your idiot son doesn't
have a single tell,

06:54.200 --> 06:56.200
but you I can read
like a stop sign.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.000
Okay.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.600
I was going to build up
to the big reveal, but I...

07:00.600 --> 07:02.400
Just cut to the chase.

07:03.500 --> 07:06.600
You remember how I had
a little crush on Naomi when she was pregnant?

07:06.600 --> 07:07.600
A little crush?

07:07.800 --> 07:10.100
You were like a monkey
trying to hump a watermelon.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.700
Are you going
to let me tell the story?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.400
I'm just fact-checking.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.200
Go ahead.

07:15.200 --> 07:19.200
Anyway, after she had the baby,
we stayed in touch,

07:19.200 --> 07:21.400
and I got to know her
and the baby and...

07:22.100 --> 07:23.800
I'm starting to care
about both of them.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.800
Aw, buddy, you got a heart
as big as your ear.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.700
But you're falling into
the same trap you always do.

07:31.700 --> 07:32.600
What's that?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.700
You're a pathological
rescuer.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.200
Ever since you're
a little kid,

07:36.200 --> 07:38.500
bringing home that
stray three-legged cat.

07:38.900 --> 07:40.000
Oh, yeah, Tippy.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
And finding the
sick baby bird...

07:43.000 --> 07:45.500
Mm.
...feeding it with
an eyedropper,nursing it back to health.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.000
Until Tippy ate it.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.100
And it's the same
thing with women.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.800
You constantly seek out
these damaged, needy broads.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.900
You know, you're right.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.500
Maybe subconsciously
I'm hoping

07:57.500 --> 07:59.500
that if I save them,
they'll love me.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.600
Perhaps.

08:00.600 --> 08:03.000
Or subconsciously you realize
the only way

08:03.000 --> 08:04.700
an emotionally healthy,
self-supporting woman

08:04.700 --> 08:06.800
would pick you up is
on a scavenger hunt.

08:08.300 --> 08:10.400
But... we digress.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.100
Please continue with
your star-crossed love story.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.500
Well, Naomi and I
have been sneaking around behind Berta's back

08:17.500 --> 08:18.400
and...

08:18.400 --> 08:19.900
I'm starting
to feel guilty about it.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.200
You want my advice?

08:21.300 --> 08:24.500
Live with the guilt
and see a doctor before that thing
grows teeth.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.400
But don't you think
the honorable thing would be to tell Berta?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.400
Sure, honorable's one way to go.

08:31.100 --> 08:35.100
But may I remind you that
this is a woman who's been known to lift the stove with one hand

08:35.500 --> 08:38.100
in order to beat a mouse
to death with the other.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.700
How much honor you think
that little fella had?

08:43.400 --> 08:45.200
Oh... now you're
just being silly.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.700
I mean, Berta's not going
to physically assault me.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.300
I hope you're right.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.500
I've grown to enjoy
these little talks.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.900
* Men... *

08:58.600 --> 09:00.700
Why don't you just pay me
what you owe me?

09:01.800 --> 09:03.600
I don't owe you till we're done.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.100
Now throw the dice.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.400
Oh, you just suck.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.900
I wouldn't need a job
if I joined the Army.

09:15.900 --> 09:18.400
You can't join
the Army.
Why not?

09:18.500 --> 09:21.100
Because you already are
all that you can be.

09:21.700 --> 09:24.900
You remember
my little burden Naomi.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.500
Oh, sure, I remember her.
Hi.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.700
She's got job
interviews
this afternoon.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.300
I'm gonna watch the baby.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.300
<i>How are you going to work
and watch the baby?</i>

09:33.300 --> 09:35.000
Who said I was gonna work?

09:37.100 --> 09:38.100
CHARLIE:
Hey, Alan.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.900
Look who's here.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.600
Oh. H-Hello.
Hi.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.500
Um... Nancy, right?

09:45.500 --> 09:48.000
Uh, Naomi.
Naomi. Naomi, sure.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.300
(chuckling):
Been a long time.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.700
Sure has.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.200
And this must be
your baby.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.600
Oh, isn't she cute?

09:53.600 --> 09:55.000
Oh, thanks.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.800
And there's
the proud grandma.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.700
Look at her beaming.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.800
Well, dip me in butter
and roll me in nuts.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.800
I, too, am shocked.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.600
So you're the
sleazeball

10:09.600 --> 10:11.100
she's been running
around with.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.600
Oh, Alan, how could you?

10:14.500 --> 10:15.800
I-It's my fault, Mom.

10:15.800 --> 10:16.900
Alan wanted to tell you.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.800
No, no, it's,
it's my responsibility.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.300
If you're gonna do anything,
do it to me.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.500
???

10:36.900 --> 10:40.900
????

10:41.400 --> 10:43.200
I made you breakfast.

10:44.000 --> 10:44.600
Really?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.500
Need to have your morning
tinkle first?

10:48.600 --> 10:50.000
No, I'm okay.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.200
Good.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.700
I made all
your favorites:

10:52.900 --> 10:55.100
scrambled egg whites,
turkey bacon,

10:55.100 --> 10:57.900
rye toast no butter,
decaf coffee.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.500
Well, thank you.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.800
You eat like a 90-year-old
man with stomach cancer,but I don't judge.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.300
So...

11:06.600 --> 11:09.100
what do you and my little girl
have planned for today?

11:09.300 --> 11:11.600
Maybe a romantic
walk on the beach?

11:11.700 --> 11:12.600
A cozy picnic?

11:12.600 --> 11:14.100
I could pack you a lunch.

11:14.200 --> 11:15.600
Uh, gee, Berta, I don't...

11:15.600 --> 11:16.600
Or how about this?

11:16.800 --> 11:18.000
I'll watch the baby

11:18.000 --> 11:20.900
and you two can spend the
afternoon in bed gettin' sticky.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.800
Ah, well, uh, as lovely
as that sounds,

11:26.100 --> 11:28.800
I wasn't really planning
on seeing Naomi today.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.700
Why not? What's wrong?

11:30.700 --> 11:32.800
Oh, please don't tell me
there's something wrong.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.600
I mean, you ain't much, but
you're the best she ever had.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.700
No, no, nothing's wrong.

11:38.700 --> 11:39.600
I just...

11:39.700 --> 11:41.000
I have to go
to work today.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.900
Oh, right.

11:42.900 --> 11:43.900
Silly me.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.900
Naomi never dated anybody
with a job before.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.900
At least not one
that's indoors and legal.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.200
I understand.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.400
Well, you let me know
if you need anything.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.300
I will.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.700
Ironing, groceries?

11:57.700 --> 11:59.300
I could lance that ear for you.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.600
Uh, no, thanks.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I know what I'm doin'.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.400
I spent a summer castrating
sheep in Montana.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.300
I'll keep that in mind.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.000
Uh, but I think it's fine.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.200
Okay.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.700
You made an old lady
very happy, Alan.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.900
I'm...

12:19.800 --> 12:21.000
glad.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.600
Bye-bye now.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.300
Bye-bye.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.400
Oh, I am so screwed.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.200
Charlie?

12:35.600 --> 12:36.900
I'm in the bathroom,
Alan.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.500
Um...

12:38.800 --> 12:40.900
I've got kind
of a delicate problem.

12:41.300 --> 12:43.500
The antibiotics are
in my dresser drawer.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.900
(toilet flushing)
No, no, it's, it's Berta.

12:45.900 --> 12:47.400
She's being ridiculously nice
to me

12:47.400 --> 12:50.300
and I'm afraid what might happen
if I break up with her daughter.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
Oh, you can't break up
with her daughter.

12:53.500 --> 12:54.900
Whaddya mean I can't break up
with her?

12:56.200 --> 12:58.300
Well, I guess
you could, but...

13:01.100 --> 13:02.500
So what am I
supposed to do,

13:02.500 --> 13:04.900
marry Naomi just
to keep Berta happy?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.700
You don't have
to marry her.

13:06.700 --> 13:09.200
Just let the relationship
follow its natural course.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.300
Natural course?

13:11.100 --> 13:12.200
Think about it, Alan.

13:12.200 --> 13:16.200
Any woman, given enough time,
will grow to loathe you.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.900
My God, you're right.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.000
So I just have to stick it out
with Naomi

13:23.000 --> 13:24.300
until she hates my guts.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.600
How long could it take?

13:27.200 --> 13:30.300
BERTA:
Damn it.Charlie, get your lazy ass out
of that bed.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.700
Hello, bright eyes.

13:34.000 --> 13:34.800
Hi.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I bagged you a lunch
to take to work.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.000
No kidding.

13:38.000 --> 13:38.900
Yeah.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.100
I also tossed in a
packet of vitamin E.

13:41.100 --> 13:44.000
Help you chalk up the
old pool cue for Naomi.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.500
Thanks.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.300
C'mere, gimme some sugar.

13:48.300 --> 13:49.400
Mwah.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.600
Oh, you are so screwed.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.100
Here you go.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.100
One hot chocolate
for the lactating mommy.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.100
Thank you.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.700
I see little Brittany Pam
is having the grande boobaccino.

14:09.700 --> 14:10.500
Yeah,

14:10.700 --> 14:12.400
and she's bitin' the straw.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.600
Listen, you got any plans
for Saturday night?

14:16.700 --> 14:17.900
I don't think so. Why?

14:18.100 --> 14:21.300
Well, my mom wants to have a big
family dinner over at her place.

14:22.100 --> 14:22.900
Family?

14:23.100 --> 14:24.100
Uh, whose family?

14:24.600 --> 14:27.900
You know, me, you, Jake,
Charlie, my mom, your mom.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.300
Oh, oh.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.300
Well, uh, that sounds like fun.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.500
Doesn't it?
Yeah.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.900
Yeah, unfortunately,
I'm busy this Saturday.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.000
But you just said...

14:36.000 --> 14:37.300
I misspoke.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.500
Oh, I get it.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.100
I'm not good enough
to meet your mother.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.900
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm, I'm just, uh,

14:42.900 --> 14:45.000
I'm concerned about the baby.

14:45.700 --> 14:46.400
Why?

14:47.100 --> 14:48.800
Oh, boy, uh,

14:48.800 --> 14:50.200
I was hoping I
wouldn't have to tell you this,

14:50.200 --> 14:52.000
but my mother...

14:54.200 --> 14:56.200
feeds on the souls of the young.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.400
Okay, just forget it.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.200
Oh, come on,
Naomi, I mean,

15:01.200 --> 15:03.100
don't you think a family
dinner's pushing things

15:03.100 --> 15:04.100
a little too fast?

15:04.100 --> 15:06.900
Too fast?
You weren't worried about things going too fast
on our first date

15:06.900 --> 15:08.900
when you chewed
through my nursing bra.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.300
In my defense, I didn't
know about the flaps.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.900
Well, I thought that
you were different.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.500
I am different.
Ask anybody.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.200
They'll tell ya,
Alan's different.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.100
No, no, no, you're not.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.900
You're just like all the rest.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.900
Flirtsy, squirtsy
and then arriva-dirtsy.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.600
Naomi, I didn't mean...
Well, I'm not that kind of girl anymore.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.800
I'm a mama now and I demand
to be treated with respect!

15:31.800 --> 15:33.000
Sweetie, sweetie,
calm down.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.100
I do respect you.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.000
I just thought the dinner
was a little premature.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.400
Premature?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.900
You weren't worried about being
premature on our first date

15:40.900 --> 15:42.900
when you ruined
a perfectly good sweater!

15:43.200 --> 15:44.100
You know what? You know what?

15:44.100 --> 15:45.200
Saturday's fine.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.600
Dinner sounds great.
We'll be there.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.400
Yeah, damn right
you'll be there.

15:49.300 --> 15:52.100
What you never seen a screamin'
woman with a bare boob?

15:57.900 --> 16:00.300
This is just mortifying.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.100
Mom.

16:02.300 --> 16:04.300
It's one thing to diddle
the help, Alan.

16:04.300 --> 16:06.400
It's another thing
to dine with them.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.700
Jake, are you listening
to your iPod?

16:09.700 --> 16:11.700
No.
Well, start.

16:13.600 --> 16:15.400
Naomi is not the help.

16:15.800 --> 16:16.900
Oh, forgive ME

16:16.900 --> 16:19.600
She's the maid's
round-heeled daughter.

16:20.700 --> 16:23.100
I mean, I'd expect this
from Charlie.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.200
He'd hump
a grilled cheese sandwich.

16:26.000 --> 16:26.900
Thanks, Mom.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.100
You're welcome, darling.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.900
And what, pray, is going
on with your ear?

16:31.900 --> 16:33.200
Uh, it's fine.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.500
It looks like
a cherry tomato.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.000
His lady friend thinks
it's "darn sexy."

16:40.400 --> 16:41.200
Well, don't worry.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.800
I'm guessing you won't
be the only one

16:42.800 --> 16:45.100
at the table tonight
with a raging infection.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.300
It's not infected.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.600
It's got a pulse, Alan.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.500
Look, Mom, there
is no reason to look down your
nose at Naomi.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.700
She and her mother are
decent, hard-working,

16:55.700 --> 16:57.100
salt-of-the-Earth people.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.200
Well, pardon me.

17:00.700 --> 17:04.700
You know, it's tacky
to arrive empty-handed. Perhaps we should stop

17:04.800 --> 17:07.599
and pickup a box of wine
or some aerosol cheese.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.900
Oh, Mom, you're on fire tonight.

17:11.300 --> 17:13.700
It's the new meds.They mix well with liquor.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.400
Oh, this was a bad idea.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.800
Charlie, didn't you tell him
that's the gay ear?

17:23.000 --> 17:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:33.200 --> 17:34.700
This is some
nice flatware.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.800
I, I gave this same pattern
to Charlie for his birthday.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.500
Yeah, he gave it to me.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.100
Next year,
he wants a roasting pan.

17:44.700 --> 17:46.500
You gave away
my flatware?

17:46.800 --> 17:49.600
To be fair, Mom,
I gave it to you.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.800
So, Berta, nice house.

17:53.800 --> 17:54.900
When do we take the tour?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.600
Have you been to the can yet?

17:56.800 --> 17:57.400
Yeah.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.700
You took it.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.900
Oh, okay.

18:03.700 --> 18:04.900
I wanna make a toast.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.600
Oh, good, a reason to drink.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.500
To Naomi and Alan.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.799
Thank God they found each other.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.400
'Cause, let's face it, they were
both running out of options.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.400
Hear, hear.
Hang on, hang on.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.700
Uh, I'd like to propose
an addendum to the toast,

18:19.700 --> 18:22.200
uh, a subordinate clause
if you will.

18:22.200 --> 18:25.600
Uh, while Naomi and I are
enjoying each other's company,

18:25.800 --> 18:27.100
we, uh, we are proceeding

18:27.100 --> 18:29.100
in a very slow
and cautious manner.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.000
Except when we're having sex.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.600
Time and place, Naomi.

18:34.300 --> 18:35.600
Time and place,

18:35.900 --> 18:37.900
Yeah, well, I wish you'd spend
a little more time

18:37.900 --> 18:39.600
and aim for the right place.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.200
Oh, God, just kill me now.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.300
Jake? Ipod?

18:45.300 --> 18:47.000
Headphones?
Thataboy.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.100
Excuse me, uh...

18:50.100 --> 18:51.400
I'd like to say a few words

18:51.400 --> 18:53.200
before we fold up
the dining room table

18:53.200 --> 18:54.900
and commence the square dancing.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.700
Alan, you're my son
and I love you.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.100
But you and I are through.

19:04.800 --> 19:05.400
What?

19:05.400 --> 19:06.800
I just can't bear it anymore.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.400
I have to cut you loose.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.600
Is that all it takes?

19:10.600 --> 19:12.300
Hey, Berta, you got
any other daughters?

19:14.500 --> 19:16.000
HECTOR:
Naomi? Are you in there?!

19:16.300 --> 19:17.100
Hector?

19:17.100 --> 19:18.700
Go away! Nobody's home!

19:19.100 --> 19:20.500
Mom!

19:20.500 --> 19:22.800
If that loser steps one foot
inside this house,

19:22.800 --> 19:24.700
I'm gettin' out my nail gun.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.200
<i>Oh, wonderful, we're gonna be
on an episode of Cops.</i>

19:30.800 --> 19:31.700
What are you doing here?

19:31.700 --> 19:33.200
I've come to see my daughter.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.700
Is that her?
What do you care?

19:34.700 --> 19:36.800
<i>You ran off.
No, I didn't
run off, mija.</i>

19:36.800 --> 19:38.600
I couldn't get back
across the border.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
They're crackin' down
'cause of these damn Arabs.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.200
Why didn't you call me?

19:43.200 --> 19:44.000
I did call.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.800
Didn't your mother
give you my messages?

19:47.800 --> 19:49.200
Whoops.

19:50.900 --> 19:52.900
Oh, Hector,
I've missed you so much.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.100
I missed you too.

19:55.900 --> 19:56.800
Alan.

19:57.500 --> 19:58.300
Yeah?

19:58.300 --> 20:01.300
Your relationship has run
its natural course.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.600
She doesn't hate me yet.
She, she's just like...

20:06.300 --> 20:08.800
A toast to Hector and Naomi.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.400
May their love last forever.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.300
What's with your ear?

20:15.300 --> 20:16.400
???

20:34.200 --> 20:35.200
ç|ñ|
Berta?

20:35.600 --> 20:36.700
Don't bother me, Charlie.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.200
I had a hard night.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.600
If you're so tired, why
don't you just stay home?

20:42.600 --> 20:43.800
Are you kidding?

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Hector invited his entire
family over to see the baby.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.600
It's like the Alamo
over there.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.300
Well, for the record,

20:52.300 --> 20:53.800
I didn't get
any sleep either.

20:54.100 --> 20:57.500
Halfway home
Alan's ear blew up and we had to take him
to the emergency room.

20:58.700 --> 20:59.700
Is he okay?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.200
Yeah, they were able
to save the lobe,

21:02.200 --> 21:04.200
but I don't think
anyone's gonna call it

21:04.200 --> 21:06.000
the gay ear anymore.

21:07.100 --> 21:07.900
Huh.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.300
Well, sweet dreams.

21:13.300 --> 21:14.300
You too.

21:14.900 --> 21:22.014
