00:36.906 --> 00:39.865
Ain't nothing more relaxing
than a day by the pool.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.084
You said it, bro.

00:42.781 --> 00:45.393
Who's ready to see some
awesome motorcycle tricks?

00:50.137 --> 00:51.051
Duck, duck, duck.

00:57.144 --> 00:58.797
Don't worry, I'm okay.

00:58.841 --> 01:01.191
You just crashed your bike
into our imaginary friend.

01:01.235 --> 01:02.975
- Captain Cool.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.890
Captain Cool
has the faint pulse.

01:04.934 --> 01:06.805
He needs the CPR.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.894
The one, two, three.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.113
It is not the working.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.419
Forgets that mouth to mouth.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.377
This man needs
some defibrillating, yo.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.032
Clear.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.817
Live, Captain Cool, live.

01:18.861 --> 01:21.733
Look, he's coming to.
I think he's gonna be okay.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.388
All right!

01:24.432 --> 01:26.173
You guys
are acting ridiculous.

01:26.216 --> 01:29.132
No, you're the one
who's acting
ridiculous, Robin.

01:29.176 --> 01:32.440
Yeah, you gots to think
before you ride that
motorcycle, fool.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.398
What is that, Captain Cool?

01:34.442 --> 01:37.749
You forgive Robin for trying
to crush you with his bike

01:37.793 --> 01:39.838
and wish to be his friend?

01:39.882 --> 01:41.492
Wow. What a cool thing to do.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.451
So, what do you say?

01:43.494 --> 01:46.018
Are you going to take
Captain cool up
on his cool offer?

01:46.062 --> 01:47.716
No way.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.370
I don't want to play with
your stupid imaginary friend?

01:50.675 --> 01:53.243
Captain Cool
is not the stupid.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.593
He's like the coolest
imaginary friend ever.

01:55.637 --> 01:56.768
Listen, Titans,

01:56.812 --> 01:58.422
you need to make sure

01:58.466 --> 01:59.945
that you don't get wrapped up
in your imaginations

01:59.989 --> 02:01.860
because they can be
very powerful things.

02:01.904 --> 02:04.036
What was that, Robin?
I can't hear you

02:04.080 --> 02:07.127
over the sweet deejay
set Captain Cool is playing.

02:07.170 --> 02:09.781
I said, you don't want
to let your imaginations

02:09.825 --> 02:11.174
get out of control.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.481
- What!
- We still can't hear you, bro.

02:13.524 --> 02:17.572
Captain Cool is laying down
the A list of the tracks.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.095
I said you--

02:19.139 --> 02:20.879
Whoo! Here comes the drop.

02:27.016 --> 02:28.496
Oh, forget it.

02:28.539 --> 02:29.453
I'm going to my room.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.458
Stupid imaginary friend.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.417
They think he's so cool.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.809
I'll tell you what's cool...

02:37.853 --> 02:40.290
organizing my comb collection.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.163
Close the door.
Close the door.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.773
What's the emergency, Titans?

02:44.816 --> 02:48.037
A giant Krock-topus monster
is attempting to eat us.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.996
Krock-topus monster?
Wait a second.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.564
Is this another one
of your imaginary games?

02:53.608 --> 02:55.218
Yeah, Captain Cool
thought it up.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.220
The captain
is the coolest, yo.

02:57.264 --> 03:00.180
Now quickly, Robin,
hand us that stack
of imaginary brakes.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.920
so we can barricade the door.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.531
Forget it.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.097
I'm not playing another
one of your dumb games.

03:05.141 --> 03:07.187
That's okay. Captain Cool
will hand them to us.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.232
- Oh, yeah.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.669
- Go, go, go!

03:21.288 --> 03:22.637
Could you guys keep it down?

03:22.680 --> 03:23.725
I'm doing important
work over here.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.728
Oh, no. The door's not holding.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.600
That Krock-topus is
coming through, yo.

03:29.644 --> 03:32.864
He's crashing us
with his tentacle grip.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.693
And now
he's gonna eat me, yo!

03:37.782 --> 03:40.350
Oh, no. How terrible
whatever will I do?

03:40.394 --> 03:42.178
It is the too late.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.964
We're now entering the darkness
of the monster's belly.

03:46.008 --> 03:47.575
Hey,
turn that back on?

03:47.618 --> 03:49.881
We can't.
We just got eaten, remember?

03:49.925 --> 03:52.014
And now
we're being digested.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.757
I'm gonna find
some more combs.

04:00.762 --> 04:01.763
Don't touch
the floor, Robin.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.422
What's wrong with the floor?

04:08.465 --> 04:11.338
It's only covered in lava.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.948
Ah! I'm slipping, yo!

04:12.991 --> 04:14.079
I'm slipping!

04:14.123 --> 04:17.126
Oh, no. Grab Beast Boy!

04:17.169 --> 04:19.171
Ah, this game is so stupid.
Why doesn't Beast Boy

04:19.215 --> 04:21.739
just transform into a bird
and fly away?

04:21.783 --> 04:24.046
Because we're imagining
we don't have superpowers

04:24.089 --> 04:25.613
to make it more exciting.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.136
It was Captain Cool's idea.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.616
He's so cool.

04:28.659 --> 04:30.313
Guys, help.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.577
I don't thinks
I could hang much longer.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.275
Great idea, Captain Cool.

04:35.318 --> 04:38.016
We can save Beasty
by using Robin's grappling gun.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.757
- What? Hey!
- Hang on.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.937
Phew, that was close, yo.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.679
It's a good thing
Robin broke our fall.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.683
Captain Cool says he's sorry
he broke your gadget,

04:52.727 --> 04:55.033
but he promises to buy
you a new one.

04:56.339 --> 04:59.386
Whatever.
I'm getting a snack.

04:59.429 --> 05:02.040
Careful. The refrigerator
is filled with lava bats,

05:02.084 --> 05:04.391
Thin crackers it is.

05:04.434 --> 05:07.785
No! The lava bats
reside in there as well.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.135
Fine. You want to play
your stupid imaginary games?

05:10.179 --> 05:12.268
Then here.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.879
Ooh, I'm tying you all up
with imaginary rope.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.446
Yeah.

05:16.490 --> 05:19.144
Now you can't do anything
and I can have a snack.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.886
But the lava bats?

05:21.930 --> 05:24.367
Don't worry, guys.
I've got imaginary scissors.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.890
Snip, snip, snip.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.023
Booyah! We're free.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.155
Oh, no, you're not.
Because I'm surrounding you

05:30.199 --> 05:32.157
in an imaginary force field.

05:34.812 --> 05:36.901
We's trapped.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.468
Don't worry, I can take
this force field out
with some dynamite.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.561
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.171
Then let's see

05:46.215 --> 05:48.739
how you like these
laser nunchucks.

05:51.176 --> 05:53.309
Man, that's nothing
compared to my bazooka

05:53.353 --> 05:55.224
that shoots other bazookas.

05:59.881 --> 06:02.666
And I have the robot suit
that fires the cobras.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.369
Laser whip attack.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.763
Slick plasma sword.

06:12.807 --> 06:13.982
Yeah.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.120
Okay, you win.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.035
I know when I'm...grenade.

06:34.437 --> 06:35.743
Oh, my goodness.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.919
It's Captain Cool

06:37.962 --> 06:39.529
Someone lose a grenade?

06:47.145 --> 06:48.233
Wow.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.453
I can't believe yous real.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.499
He's not the only thing. Look.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.720
Incredible.

06:56.764 --> 06:58.461
How is this possible?

06:58.505 --> 06:59.941
Isn't it obvious?

06:59.984 --> 07:01.421
We got so wrapped up
in our imaginations,

07:01.464 --> 07:03.031
that we brought them to life.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.293
Snake.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.295
Be cool, my man.

07:06.338 --> 07:09.472
The snake means no harm.
He's just scared.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.300
Come on, little dude.
It's cool.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.259
So cool!

07:14.303 --> 07:15.696
Oh, my.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.741
The Captain Cool is even
cool to the animals.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.310
Wow! That's so cool!

07:21.353 --> 07:23.355
Captain Cool
is the coolest, yo,

07:23.399 --> 07:24.835
I'm so glad he's real.

07:24.879 --> 07:27.664
But if Captain Cool is real,
then so is...

07:27.708 --> 07:29.013
The lava!

07:36.238 --> 07:37.631
We'll have to get
out of here.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.546
No problem.
I'll just open up a portal.

07:39.589 --> 07:41.678
Azarath Metrion Zinthos.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.289
My magic isn't working?

07:44.333 --> 07:46.030
Of course it isn't working.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.250
You imagined you no longer
have superpowers, remember?

07:48.293 --> 07:49.860
Yo, be cool.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.962
Oh right. We imagined
the living room

08:05.006 --> 08:07.574
with a massive
lava filled dungeon.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.010
This is gonna be difficult.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.794
Curse our big imaginations.

08:10.838 --> 08:13.014
It's cool. All we got to do
is get to the elevator,

08:13.057 --> 08:15.146
and then we're home free.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.019
Let's go, team.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.554
Oh, no!

08:31.598 --> 08:33.251
The elevator is
out of the reach.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.820
Hey, no worries.

08:36.864 --> 08:39.083
We can use these
couch cushions
as stepping stones.

08:41.477 --> 08:42.652
What a cool idea.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.436
Cool ideas are all I've got.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.916
Now follow me.

08:52.053 --> 08:53.881
Wow, he's gonna make it.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.970
That's why they call him
Captain Cool, yo.

09:03.107 --> 09:05.980
Actually, Captain Cool
is just my nickname.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.895
My real name is Herbert.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.855
Captain Cool.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.120
He will always be

09:16.164 --> 09:19.210
the coolest of the Captains
I ever knew.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.822
He was just so cool.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.911
So cool.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.612
No time to mourn, Titans.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.396
That monster is headed
straight for us.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.484
Look out.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.012
Keep jumping.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.884
There is nowhere else to go.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.799
We's doomed.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.677
Yo!

09:50.720 --> 09:52.026
Captain Cool.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.203
Captain Cool, you're alive.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.161
Well, that's not the first time
I had to spin kick my way

09:57.205 --> 09:58.859
out of a monster's stomach,
you know.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.425
It's not like--not every day,

10:00.469 --> 10:01.688
but like, on Wednesdays.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.690
- There's our ride.

10:03.733 --> 10:04.908
Now what do you say?

10:04.952 --> 10:06.257
Let's get out of here.

10:06.301 --> 10:08.782
I'd say that's
a pretty cool idea.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.307
Wicked Cool!

10:14.701 --> 10:15.789
We're safe.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.007
Listen, Captain Cool.

10:17.051 --> 10:18.661
I owe you an apology.

10:18.705 --> 10:20.097
You're not stupid.

10:20.141 --> 10:22.012
You're the coolest
imaginary friend ever.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.666
Yo, forget about it.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.928
<i>Herbert.</i>

10:24.972 --> 10:26.713
- Who said that?
- My mom.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.019
Your mom?

10:29.063 --> 10:31.500
<i>Herbert, stop playing
with your imaginary friends,</i>

10:31.543 --> 10:34.024
<i>and come down to dinner,
young man.</i>

10:34.068 --> 10:35.373
Coming, mom

10:35.417 --> 10:36.374
Yo!
