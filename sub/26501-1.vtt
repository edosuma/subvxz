[woman] <i>Everyone remembers
where they were that day.</i>

01:03.295 --> 01:07.163
<i>The day of The Event.</i>

01:07.165 --> 01:09.866
[teacher] All right, so we're gonna go
back to start. What should we name him?

01:09.868 --> 01:11.835
What should we name Superdog?

01:11.837 --> 01:13.871
- What do you think?
- [boy] Doug.

01:13.873 --> 01:16.740
Doug? Sure.

01:16.742 --> 01:20.710
Let's see.
I'll find his picture.

01:20.712 --> 01:23.647
[low rumbling]

01:23.649 --> 01:25.549
Um... all right.

01:25.551 --> 01:28.686
What I want to ask you guys
today is who has pets at home?

01:28.688 --> 01:33.591
- A Rottweiler.
- You have a Rottweiler? What?

01:33.593 --> 01:37.197
[indistinct dialogue continues]

01:45.438 --> 01:48.775
[rumbling]

01:53.879 --> 01:56.381
It's okay. It's okay.

01:58.216 --> 01:59.916
Look at me.
Ronnie, look at me!

01:59.918 --> 02:02.186
[sirens wailing]

02:02.188 --> 02:04.490
[woman] It's okay.

02:45.397 --> 02:48.598
[alarm rings]

02:48.600 --> 02:51.770
[shower running]

03:13.859 --> 03:17.197
[echoing, indistinct voices]

03:18.364 --> 03:20.631
- Morning, babe.
- Morning.

03:20.633 --> 03:23.503
[TV plays indistinctly]

03:31.276 --> 03:32.842
Thanks, Mom.

03:32.844 --> 03:35.713
[man on TV] <i>There
is no basis to the theories</i>

03:35.715 --> 03:37.881
<i>of the so-called
Truther Movement.</i>

03:37.883 --> 03:42.318
<i>The Joint Congressional Committee's
findings were confirmed</i>

03:42.320 --> 03:43.988
<i>by independent investigations.</i>

03:43.990 --> 03:48.561
<i>Reports of new remnants
cannot be verified.</i>

03:55.668 --> 03:59.602
So Janine and I were talking, and she said
that she saw a new one on the bus yesterday.

03:59.604 --> 04:03.607
Do we have to talk about these
things every morning, babe?

04:03.609 --> 04:07.710
- These things?
- It's nothing to get upset about.

04:07.712 --> 04:11.482
I'm not getting upset. It's just
that you always say stuff like that

04:11.484 --> 04:15.388
and you're pretending
like he's not even...

04:19.358 --> 04:21.461
...even there.

04:24.029 --> 04:28.267
I'm gonna go to school.
Thanks for breakfast.

04:36.975 --> 04:39.942
[Ronnie] <i>That's my life.</i>

04:39.944 --> 04:42.314
<i>It's all our lives
since it happened.</i>

04:44.449 --> 04:46.617
<i>The Event took
people we cared about,</i>

04:46.619 --> 04:50.387
<i>but it also left
a part of them behind.</i>

04:50.389 --> 04:53.324
<i>Remnants.</i>

04:53.326 --> 04:56.360
<i>We all see them.</i>

04:56.362 --> 04:58.394
<i>Every day.</i>

04:58.396 --> 04:59.766
<i>Everywhere.</i>

05:03.836 --> 05:09.539
- [horn honks]
- <i>It's like walking through a haunted house,</i>

05:09.541 --> 05:13.012
<i>but it's the whole world
that's haunted.</i>

05:21.519 --> 05:25.555
<i>Jewel City, Illinois.</i>

05:25.557 --> 05:29.392
<i>We were only 50 miles
from ground zero.</i>

05:29.394 --> 05:33.497
<i>A government lab
had some kind of meltdown.</i>

05:33.499 --> 05:37.601
[reporter] <i>Preliminary reports tonight
indicating an explosion at Ashburn Labs.</i>

05:37.603 --> 05:40.070
[reporter 2] <i>The source of the
blast, a large particle collider,</i>

05:40.072 --> 05:41.805
<i>part of an advanced
energy research program</i>

05:41.807 --> 05:43.574
<i>headed by noted physicist</i>

05:43.576 --> 05:44.942
<i>Dr. Martin Steiner.</i>

05:44.944 --> 05:47.144
[Ronnie] <i>The energy wave
left buildings</i>

05:47.146 --> 05:50.817
<i>standing, but the people
in its path...</i>

05:52.084 --> 05:55.151
<i>...weren't so lucky.</i>

05:55.153 --> 05:59.690
<i>All anyone knows for sure
is that we can never go back,</i>

05:59.692 --> 06:02.659
<i>back to a world
before the no-go zone.</i>

06:02.661 --> 06:05.529
[reporter] <i>...declaring the city
of Chicago a no-go zone.</i>

06:05.531 --> 06:09.435
[Ronnie] <i>To a world before
every house had a panic room.</i>

06:11.903 --> 06:15.875
<i>To a world where the kids who
pretended you didn't exist...</i>

06:17.475 --> 06:19.879
<i>...actually did exist.</i>

06:21.579 --> 06:24.748
- [school bell rings]
- <i>To a world before all this.</i>

06:24.750 --> 06:28.185
- <i>To a world before...</i>
- [man] <i>Ghosts.</i>

06:28.187 --> 06:31.654
Ghouls. Specters.
Spectral remnants.

06:31.656 --> 06:34.190
- "Rems," as the kids say.
- [laughter]

06:34.192 --> 06:36.726
- What else do you got?
- Spooks?

06:36.728 --> 06:40.630
Spooks. Love it.
Yeah, spooks. Scares me.

06:40.632 --> 06:42.968
- [laughter]
- He's so hot.

06:45.069 --> 06:47.971
All right, let's get to work.
Uh, Mr. Trantolo.

06:47.973 --> 06:51.909
Looking a little nervous under
that handsome head of hair,

06:51.911 --> 06:53.877
which is odd because
I know you did the reading.

06:53.879 --> 06:55.579
What are the three laws
of spectral remnants?

06:55.581 --> 06:57.781
- Make me proud, James Dean.
- [boy] Loser!

06:57.783 --> 07:00.149
Law one, they aren't sentient.

07:00.151 --> 07:02.185
They're not
conscious-thinking beings.

07:02.187 --> 07:06.022
They're projections of the past.
Like holograms.

07:06.024 --> 07:09.726
Very good. Law two.
Miss McNulty?

07:09.728 --> 07:12.094
Um, they can't
alter their imagery.

07:12.096 --> 07:14.798
Exactly. Once remnants appear,

07:14.800 --> 07:18.101
they do the same thing
for the same time every time.

07:18.103 --> 07:20.870
Like a film reel being replayed.

07:20.872 --> 07:22.772
These are loops.

07:22.774 --> 07:25.175
Might be a five-second loop,
maybe five minutes.

07:25.177 --> 07:28.846
But they never vary
and they always repeat.

07:28.848 --> 07:33.653
So now, for the big finish,
law three, Miss Calder.

07:36.922 --> 07:40.757
Um, if we could have
a minute of your attention.

07:40.759 --> 07:43.526
- [laughter]
- Law three.

07:43.528 --> 07:45.896
Um, they can't affect
our natural world.

07:45.898 --> 07:48.932
Very good, Veronica Calder.

07:48.934 --> 07:51.200
Remnant phenomenon
may be very diverse.

07:51.202 --> 07:55.204
They might be playing out moments of
their life, even their own death,

07:55.206 --> 07:57.808
but no matter what,
they can't think,

07:57.810 --> 08:01.577
they can't change,
they can't touch.

08:01.579 --> 08:04.947
So why is it that the ghosts...
rems...

08:04.949 --> 08:06.983
...aren't just the people
who died in The Event?

08:06.985 --> 08:09.920
Well, there's a lot
we still don't understand.

08:09.922 --> 08:14.824
Our best guess is that they are drawn
to locations of emotional significance.

08:14.826 --> 08:17.928
There's evidence that rems
have always been around us.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.863
Hiroshima. Nagasaki. Chernobyl.

08:20.865 --> 08:23.132
In each of these events,
though, enough time goes by

08:23.134 --> 08:25.569
and there are few remnants
to be found,

08:25.571 --> 08:27.570
so the consensus is that's
what will eventually happen here

08:27.572 --> 08:31.007
as we get further
from The Event.

08:31.009 --> 08:33.174
I see the face of a skeptic.

08:33.177 --> 08:35.912
Miss Calder, speak.

08:35.914 --> 08:39.148
Well, it's just, I mean,
if that's true,

08:39.150 --> 08:42.921
then why does it seem
like there are more of them?

08:45.990 --> 08:49.028
What evidence do you
have to support this theory?

08:51.263 --> 08:52.899
What about her?

08:54.767 --> 08:58.204
[indistinct chatter]

09:01.307 --> 09:04.810
[hushed whispering]

09:26.731 --> 09:29.166
[indistinct chatter]

09:29.168 --> 09:33.639
- [school bell rings]
- [indistinct chatter]

09:35.307 --> 09:38.108
Okay, girl, so your
birthday is in like a week.

09:38.110 --> 09:42.045
So I was thinking, get a little crazy,
have a little bit of a party...

09:42.047 --> 09:45.350
Lady Calder. A word.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.853
A "C."

09:50.855 --> 09:52.355
That's not really your look.

09:52.357 --> 09:56.759
I've come to expect hoodies,
scowls, and A's.

09:56.761 --> 09:59.931
Talk to me.
What's the deal?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.366
Is this your daughter?

10:02.368 --> 10:04.001
Yeah. She's my angel.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.302
That's, like,
feels like two seconds ago.

10:06.304 --> 10:09.906
She's your age now. Wait a minute.
Oh, my God. Wait.

10:09.908 --> 10:12.642
You were sucking up to me to try
to distract me, weren't you?

10:12.644 --> 10:15.378
- I was not.
- That's my move. You stole that move from me.

10:15.380 --> 10:19.916
Get your own move.
But Ronnie, until then, focus.

10:19.918 --> 10:23.686
I know what kind of potential you have.
I just need you to work with me.

10:23.688 --> 10:27.824
- Okay.
- Here goes.

10:27.826 --> 10:31.027
- Early birthday present.
- Thank you.

10:31.029 --> 10:33.930
Oh, and Ronnie,
one more thing.

10:33.932 --> 10:37.367
- If you need to talk to anybody...
- Your door is always open?

10:37.369 --> 10:40.070
No, actually, I was gonna
say try another teacher first,

10:40.072 --> 10:44.373
but, uh, yeah, sure,
let's go with that.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.276
See you tomorrow,
Mr. Bittner.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.712
[girl] So I didn't tell her
she looked fat,

10:48.714 --> 10:50.814
but she most definitely
looked fat.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.214
I mean, some people just
don't understand that you can't

10:52.216 --> 10:55.053
wear a crop top
with low-rise jeans.

10:56.455 --> 10:58.055
What's up with you
and Ghost Boy?

10:58.057 --> 11:01.223
- Ghost Boy?
- Kirk Lane?

11:01.225 --> 11:02.758
He's like obsessed with rems.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.361
He got expelled
from his old school

11:04.363 --> 11:06.396
and ended up in a mental
hospital or something.

11:06.398 --> 11:09.999
Whatever he did,
I heard it was bad.

11:10.001 --> 11:12.337
Like, really bad.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.144
Why are the cute ones
always sociopaths?

11:33.926 --> 11:37.163
[man] <i>You have
to let go, Ronnie.</i>

11:38.730 --> 11:40.129
Try to let go, baby.

11:40.131 --> 11:41.797
You can do it.

11:41.799 --> 11:43.767
You got it.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.201
You got it!
You're doing it!

11:45.203 --> 11:49.908
Oh, that's it. That's it!

11:53.479 --> 11:55.781
<i>Okay, now come back.</i>

12:00.384 --> 12:01.917
I got you.

12:01.919 --> 12:04.820
You never need to be scared,
baby.

12:04.822 --> 12:06.424
Right here. Come on!

12:11.964 --> 12:16.299
[laughs] Come here. I got you.

12:16.301 --> 12:20.004
- Oh, I got you!
- [grunts]

12:30.481 --> 12:35.053
<i>When you need me,
I'll always be here, Ronnie.</i>

12:36.421 --> 12:37.954
<i>Always.</i>

12:37.956 --> 12:41.860
<i>Ready? Go, baby!</i>

12:58.376 --> 13:00.979
[screams, gasps]

13:09.520 --> 13:13.324
[panting]

13:58.370 --> 14:00.505
[mother] Ron?

14:02.307 --> 14:04.909
[whispering echo]

14:50.589 --> 14:52.289
[Mr. Bittner]
Okay, people. Listen up.

14:52.291 --> 14:55.661
You'll write a research paper
based on a topic...

14:58.263 --> 15:03.499
[echoing voice] ...split you
into pairs for this project.

15:03.501 --> 15:07.105
- Now, it's essential...
- Mr. Bittner?

15:19.283 --> 15:21.953
Ronnie, your ear.

15:33.331 --> 15:36.967
- Ooh! Ah, sorry. Hi.
- Easy, Miss Calder.

15:36.969 --> 15:40.236
- Hey. How's that ear doing?
- Fine. It's nothing.

15:40.238 --> 15:44.174
Good. You know you're really doing
something right as a teacher

15:44.176 --> 15:47.546
when the students' ears
start to bleed spontaneously.

15:48.980 --> 15:50.379
Hey, uh, Mr. Bittner!

15:50.381 --> 15:52.281
I was wondering
if I could I ask you something.

15:52.283 --> 15:54.584
- It's important.
- It's last period on Friday.

15:54.586 --> 15:58.957
- Nothing's important right now.
- It's about remnants.

16:00.725 --> 16:03.328
Is this related
to your school project?

16:07.732 --> 16:11.033
Okay. You know where I live, right?
James Road, by the Richards' old place?

16:11.035 --> 16:14.137
- Yeah.
- I have office hours at home today.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.006
<i>I have some time
after my last session.</i>

16:16.008 --> 16:21.111
<i>At 5:30. Don't be late.</i>

16:21.113 --> 16:23.113
Remember we talked
about your attention issues.

16:23.115 --> 16:27.050
Keep working on that last paragraph, bud.
It's gonna be great.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.219
I just... know it.

16:29.221 --> 16:32.388
Come on in, Ronnie.
I appreciate your punctuality.

16:32.390 --> 16:36.225
- [dog barking]
- The place is a madhouse. Eva!

16:36.227 --> 16:41.064
- No. It's really beautiful.
- Thank you.

16:41.066 --> 16:44.367
It's kind of a mess
right now. Come on up.

16:44.369 --> 16:47.105
Let me get this
out of the way. Eva!

16:48.139 --> 16:50.205
Eva!

16:50.207 --> 16:53.443
Eva. Homework.
Finish it, now.

16:53.445 --> 16:56.548
I'll be down to check it when I'm
done here. This is not a drill.

16:57.816 --> 17:00.083
No hug, no hello.

17:00.085 --> 17:02.719
Tell me something.
You turn into a teenager

17:02.721 --> 17:07.423
and you just stop hugging your dad?
Is that a rule or something?

17:07.425 --> 17:09.761
I wouldn't know.

17:12.463 --> 17:15.464
- I'm sorry, Ronnie.
- It's all right.

17:15.467 --> 17:18.200
Well, uh, other than
making you feel horrible...

17:18.202 --> 17:21.103
- [chuckles]
- ...how can I help you?

17:21.105 --> 17:25.674
Hypothetically, could a ghost or
a rem communicate with someone?

17:25.675 --> 17:28.377
What would this ghost
have said?

17:28.380 --> 17:31.413
- He didn't say anything.
- You said he talked.

17:31.415 --> 17:35.584
- I said he communicated.
- What, did he send you a Snapchat?

17:35.586 --> 17:40.222
- [scoffs]
- Aren't you mildly impressed I know what Snapchat is?

17:40.224 --> 17:42.624
It's very impressive,
Mr. Bittner. Anyways...

17:42.626 --> 17:45.562
- I was in the shower.
- He was in the bathroom?

17:45.564 --> 17:49.099
Yeah. He was at the sink,
and then I slipped.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.534
- I fell, hit my head.
- You hit your head, Ronnie.

17:51.536 --> 17:53.536
Yeah, but I didn't
hit it that hard.

17:53.538 --> 17:56.238
Hard enough to have your ear
bleed all over my class.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.873
Have you ever had
a concussion?

17:57.875 --> 17:59.642
- Ronnie...
- I know what I saw.

17:59.644 --> 18:02.812
Remnants can't
communicate with you, Ronnie.

18:02.814 --> 18:07.417
They're just... residue.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.620
Reminders of things we want to remember,
things we wish we could forget,

18:10.622 --> 18:13.456
but that's all they are,
for better or for worse.

18:13.458 --> 18:16.258
- But the laws, they...
- I know what you thought you saw, Ronnie,

18:16.260 --> 18:20.199
but it just isn't possible.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.228
[whispering echoes]

20:49.013 --> 20:51.346
- Why are you following me?
- Holy shit!

20:51.348 --> 20:53.850
Hi. Um...

20:53.852 --> 20:56.753
I...

20:56.755 --> 21:02.324
Look, I saw this new remnant
in my bathroom yesterday, and...

21:02.326 --> 21:04.930
...I've never seen it.
It was new.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.401
Come with me.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.068
No. I'm not going in there.

21:13.070 --> 21:15.740
Hey, you followed me.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.363
Kirk?

21:41.365 --> 21:44.935
- Get ready.
- For what?

21:53.845 --> 21:56.981
Okay, go. Count! Count them.
Count them. Count these.

22:02.953 --> 22:07.425
[stammers] There are so many.
I'm losing track.

22:20.571 --> 22:22.106
Holy shit.

22:23.375 --> 22:26.441
There were 16 last month.

22:26.443 --> 22:28.411
Hey!

22:28.413 --> 22:31.480
So, wait. Hold on.
You're like a Truther?

22:31.482 --> 22:34.650
I just have more questions
than some people seem to.

22:34.652 --> 22:37.687
Like you.
I've seen you in class.

22:37.689 --> 22:40.422
You're awake.

22:40.424 --> 22:42.057
Okay, so then help me.

22:42.059 --> 22:45.364
Help me figure out
who this rem is.

22:51.001 --> 22:53.371
No, thanks. I'm good.

22:54.571 --> 22:56.671
The paper. For Bittner.

22:56.673 --> 23:00.008
You need a partner.
Come on.

23:00.010 --> 23:06.449
Do this for me, and I'll write the
papers for the both of us. Please.

23:06.451 --> 23:11.789
This rem, why do you care?
What makes him so special?

23:14.858 --> 23:17.695
I think he might
want to hurt me.

23:21.965 --> 23:24.100
- Thanks.
- Okay, what we need to do

23:24.102 --> 23:27.471
is figure out who this rem is,
or was.

23:32.743 --> 23:34.776
Sorry.

23:34.778 --> 23:39.949
Okay, I say we take Brian's
photo and then we Google...

23:39.951 --> 23:42.051
Whoa. What did you say?

23:42.053 --> 23:44.423
You called the rem Brian.
Why?

23:46.657 --> 23:49.025
I... I don't know.

23:49.027 --> 23:52.596
It just popped into my head,
I guess.

23:56.500 --> 24:00.001
Look, it's not that simple. You can't
just take a photograph of a rem.

24:00.003 --> 24:03.005
You gotta have a spectrographic lens.
Those things cost millions of dollars.

24:03.007 --> 24:05.141
Okay, so we improvise.

24:05.143 --> 24:08.009
Chandler Deckert, he's been in
love with me since the 7th grade.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.213
He'll help us.

24:13.183 --> 24:16.686
- [glass shatters]
- Still got it.

24:16.688 --> 24:20.155
In theory, it would be
possible to simulate the effect

24:20.157 --> 24:22.792
of a spectrographic field and
capture a rem on a regular camera.

24:22.794 --> 24:27.196
- Great.
- I can show you how, but I'd need something in return.

24:27.198 --> 24:30.833
- Like what?
- One date.

24:30.835 --> 24:32.671
- No.
- No.

24:34.271 --> 24:35.238
Tell people we hooked up.

24:35.240 --> 24:38.540
- Fine.
- No.

24:38.542 --> 24:40.242
All right. You're gonna
need a couple things:

24:40.244 --> 24:43.246
black lights,
air purifier, and, um...

24:43.248 --> 24:47.751
Oh, you may need to steal some
things from the chem supply closet.

24:52.656 --> 24:55.757
[Chandler] <i>A spectrograph basically
generates a charged environment</i>

24:55.759 --> 25:01.697
<i>in which spectral particles, what makes
up a remnant, are capturable on film.</i>

25:01.699 --> 25:04.568
Shh! My mom's asleep.

25:07.905 --> 25:11.641
[Chandler] <i>Most air purifiers use
what's called a negative ion generator,</i>

25:11.643 --> 25:15.044
<i>a series of wires in there creates
gas molecules with negative charges</i>

25:15.046 --> 25:19.183
<i>that stick to whatever's in the
air and collect in the filter.</i>

25:21.184 --> 25:23.719
What we're gonna do
is reverse that.

25:23.721 --> 25:28.125
<i>Send those particles out into the
air and charge that bathroom up.</i>

25:31.796 --> 25:34.296
<i>Remnants are also
technically phosphorous.</i>

25:34.298 --> 25:36.832
They emit invisible light
in response to radiation.

25:36.834 --> 25:40.635
So to complete the effect and make
sure your camera captures it,

25:40.637 --> 25:42.907
<i>you hit it with a black light.</i>

25:45.609 --> 25:48.946
Then just
point and shoot.

25:56.887 --> 26:00.288
You haven't seen Brian
since that morning, right?

26:00.290 --> 26:02.324
He might not be coming.

26:02.326 --> 26:06.730
No. He'll show.

26:08.165 --> 26:10.335
[soft thud]

26:13.805 --> 26:15.941
Mom?

26:59.349 --> 27:03.753
[clock ticking]

27:03.755 --> 27:06.221
Kirk! Kirk!

27:06.223 --> 27:09.091
Kirk! Kirk! There was...
There was a man.

27:09.093 --> 27:12.327
- He disappeared or he ran...
- Hey, hey, calm down. Shh.

27:12.329 --> 27:16.399
- Just calm down, okay?
- [thudding]

27:16.401 --> 27:20.305
Okay, you stay here. Do you have
anything I can use as a weapon?

27:26.711 --> 27:28.777
I thought I told you
to stay put.

27:28.779 --> 27:30.078
Yeah, I heard you.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.850
Fine, then just
stay behind me.

27:41.726 --> 27:43.159
- [shouting]
- [screams]

27:43.161 --> 27:44.860
- Oh!
- No!

27:44.862 --> 27:47.830
[panting] Who is this?

27:47.832 --> 27:49.465
Um...

27:49.467 --> 27:53.201
This is Kirk.
Kirk, meet my mom.

27:53.203 --> 27:55.438
- Mom, meet Kirk.
- Hi.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.107
Uh, we were working on a school project
together. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

27:59.109 --> 28:00.276
Are you okay, baby?
Are you hurt?

28:00.278 --> 28:01.811
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Are you?

28:01.813 --> 28:04.747
Yeah. I heard
something downstairs

28:04.749 --> 28:05.980
and, my God,
I was so scared.

28:05.982 --> 28:07.449
Did you see what
the guy looked like?

28:07.451 --> 28:11.353
Um, no. I mean,
it was dark,

28:11.355 --> 28:12.921
but it could have been a rem.

28:12.923 --> 28:14.789
Brian.

28:14.791 --> 28:17.392
- I guess, but I don't...
- No, Ronnie. It's 6:30.

28:17.394 --> 28:21.863
- I mean, Brian.
- What? Who?

28:21.865 --> 28:24.400
- Mom, somebody was in here. Call the police.
- What?

28:24.402 --> 28:26.104
Just call them, please, now!

28:30.842 --> 28:33.044
- Huh.
- It's not working.

28:34.811 --> 28:36.312
- Kirk!
- Just hold on.

28:36.314 --> 28:37.981
Gimme this... this should work.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.283
You really needed
my help on this project.

28:41.285 --> 28:44.288
- [grunts]
- [whirring]

28:45.355 --> 28:47.826
Point and shoot.

29:09.846 --> 29:12.448
[loud bang]

29:12.450 --> 29:14.283
[fizzling sound]

29:14.285 --> 29:17.085
This didn't happen last time.

29:17.087 --> 29:19.220
[crackling]

29:19.222 --> 29:21.259
[whirring]

29:24.060 --> 29:26.862
- [roaring]
- Ronnie!

29:26.864 --> 29:29.198
[gasping]

29:29.200 --> 29:31.469
What the hell just happened?

29:45.449 --> 29:47.982
Brian...

29:47.984 --> 29:50.254
He's a killer, Ronnie.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.363
[Kirk] So I downloaded
the video we shot,

30:01.365 --> 30:03.097
image-searched Brian's face
and this is what came up.

30:03.099 --> 30:05.167
"Pastor Greer's daughter,
Mary Greer,

30:05.169 --> 30:08.304
was abducted four years ago
next week."

30:08.306 --> 30:10.038
They found her body in a lake.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.474
They have a photo of her the day
before she disappeared.

30:12.476 --> 30:16.845
The pastor's daughter.
Mary Greer.

30:16.847 --> 30:21.819
You were worried he wants to
hurt you? Maybe you were right.

30:36.366 --> 30:38.400
[indistinct chatter]

30:38.402 --> 30:40.971
There she is.

30:51.883 --> 30:55.353
[echoing whispers]

31:06.396 --> 31:10.932
What would you like to know about
the boy who murdered my daughter?

31:10.934 --> 31:15.973
- Do you know his name?
- No.

31:19.175 --> 31:22.646
Whoever he was,
I do know he stalked her first.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.650
<i>He followed her on campus.</i>

31:33.958 --> 31:36.427
<i>He approached her there.</i>

31:44.602 --> 31:50.439
They apparently got into
some kind of... disagreement.

31:50.441 --> 31:52.975
Stop! Stop!
Stop, Mary. Listen, Mary.

31:52.977 --> 31:57.982
Somehow, he eventually persuaded
my daughter to come with him.

32:00.417 --> 32:04.187
He was the last person she
was seen alive with before...

32:06.123 --> 32:09.224
[sirens wailing outside]

32:09.226 --> 32:12.597
<i>Police found him
at a local motel...</i>

32:19.236 --> 32:22.073
...the day after
they found Mary.

32:26.676 --> 32:29.046
[gunshot]

32:35.519 --> 32:40.122
[Ronnie] Okay, so we know
Mary Greer, this mystery guy,

32:40.124 --> 32:43.359
- he abducts her...
- [Kirk] Strangles her.

32:43.361 --> 32:45.594
[Ronnie] ...and
then he kills her.

32:45.596 --> 32:48.529
Why? Who...
How does he know her?

32:48.531 --> 32:50.632
And, I mean,
does she even know him?

32:50.634 --> 32:54.436
He's not from here. If he was, Jewel
City's not that big of a place.

32:54.438 --> 32:58.039
Somebody would have known him,
so I doubt she did.

32:58.041 --> 33:00.342
Yeah, but he knows me,
and he knew her.

33:00.344 --> 33:03.746
So... how?
We're missing something.

33:03.748 --> 33:06.715
Yeah.

33:06.717 --> 33:09.651
Wait, why are Mary's ages
different on all of these?

33:09.653 --> 33:11.689
Let me see.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.793
Well, here's why.

33:17.795 --> 33:20.362
The day she went missing was
the day before her birthday.

33:20.364 --> 33:23.431
That's why the ages
on the articles are different.

33:23.433 --> 33:26.200
When they found her, it was
already past her birthday.

33:26.202 --> 33:28.504
She was already
a year older, technically.

33:28.506 --> 33:32.509
"Mary Greer was
born February 29th."

33:34.244 --> 33:39.649
- Leap Day.
- So?

33:42.519 --> 33:44.788
That's my birthday.

33:47.458 --> 33:51.696
- [fizzling]
- [echoing whispers]

33:54.230 --> 33:55.599
- [window slams]
- [gasps]

33:58.301 --> 34:00.203
We're closing in five minutes.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.309
[sighs] Come on. Let's go.

34:10.514 --> 34:12.181
Ronnie.

34:27.664 --> 34:31.101
I don't remember
writing any of that.

34:35.606 --> 34:39.110
- [school bell rings]
- [indistinct chatter]

34:43.280 --> 34:44.482
Mr. Lane.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.684
I received a call this morning
from Pastor Greer

34:49.686 --> 34:53.856
about a Jewel City student harassing
her about her daughter's death.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.657
Would you like
to explain this to me?

34:56.659 --> 34:59.596
School project.

35:03.134 --> 35:05.833
You won't be smiling
if I suspend you, Mr. Lane.

35:05.835 --> 35:12.273
So what's the real reason
you went to Pastor Greer?

35:12.275 --> 35:16.446
[band playing]

35:19.382 --> 35:23.751
[cheering]

35:23.753 --> 35:25.287
Cannot believe
you dragged me here.

35:25.289 --> 35:28.659
I had to.
I barely see you anymore.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.592
Oh, my God.

35:31.594 --> 35:33.162
There's my boyfriend.

35:33.164 --> 35:35.664
And where's yours?

35:35.666 --> 35:37.465
He's not my boyfriend.

35:37.467 --> 35:42.570
And this, um, this isn't
exactly Kirk's scene.

35:42.572 --> 35:45.173
Oh, it's not. Okay.

35:45.175 --> 35:47.943
So what is Kirk's scene?
What does Kirk like to do?

35:47.945 --> 35:50.912
- [phone chimes]
- He's normal, I guess.

35:50.914 --> 35:54.316
Okay, Kirk Lane is normal?

35:54.318 --> 35:58.586
Okay. That's new. All right.

35:58.588 --> 36:00.190
Great.

36:05.762 --> 36:07.862
[cheering]

36:07.864 --> 36:11.800
He's not a bad guy, you know.
He's just... different.

36:11.802 --> 36:18.539
Okay. All I'm saying is that maybe people
are weirded out by him for a reason.

36:18.541 --> 36:24.246
Well, you can't always
judge a book by its cover...

36:24.248 --> 36:25.950
What's up?

36:30.353 --> 36:32.521
I'll be right back.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

36:32.523 --> 36:36.227
- Oh.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

36:48.405 --> 36:49.637
Excuse me.

36:49.639 --> 36:51.442
Sorry.

37:05.688 --> 37:08.992
[band playing echoing music]

37:12.329 --> 37:14.498
[background noise becomes muted]

37:19.503 --> 37:22.472
[cheering]

37:30.014 --> 37:32.581
[background noise is muted]

37:32.583 --> 37:35.753
[warped notes play]

37:38.621 --> 37:40.290
Sorry.

37:52.536 --> 37:56.273
[echoing whispers]

38:14.490 --> 38:17.559
[cheering]

38:17.561 --> 38:20.798
[echoing whispers]

38:24.068 --> 38:25.400
Ronnie!

38:25.402 --> 38:28.539
[silence]

38:36.780 --> 38:40.685
[echoing whispers]

38:42.119 --> 38:44.952
[high-pitched squeal]

38:44.954 --> 38:48.491
[screaming, shouting]

38:51.128 --> 38:54.398
Oh, my God! Mr. Pescatelli!

38:57.434 --> 39:00.538
[panting]

39:08.711 --> 39:11.648
[indistinct shouting]

39:14.985 --> 39:20.054
<i>Initial reports are Jewel High School principal
William Pescatelli committed suicide.</i>

39:20.056 --> 39:22.891
- <i>The school community is devastated...</i>
- <i>I'll get it.</i>

39:22.893 --> 39:27.095
<i>and police are investigating
the details of what happened.</i>

39:27.097 --> 39:29.430
Why the hell aren't you
answering your phone?

39:29.432 --> 39:31.833
It's charging. What's up?

39:31.835 --> 39:34.137
[TV continues indistinctly]

39:37.974 --> 39:39.907
Ronnie, I told him.

39:39.909 --> 39:41.709
Pescatelli, I told him
about us and Greer.

39:41.711 --> 39:44.512
He said he'd look into it,
and now he's dead.

39:44.514 --> 39:46.014
They're saying
it's a suicide.

39:46.016 --> 39:50.485
No, Ronnie, listen to me.
That is why he's dead.

39:50.487 --> 39:52.554
I'm telling you, Ronnie,
something is going on here.

39:52.556 --> 39:56.657
- He's dead because I told him.
- Kirk, come on, we don't know that.

39:56.659 --> 39:59.894
And, in case you're wondering, no,
I have not found the other one

39:59.896 --> 40:02.496
since you attempted
to kill my mother with it.

40:02.498 --> 40:04.566
Yeah, no,
I am sorry about that.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.967
You do have amazingly
large feet, by the way.

40:06.969 --> 40:09.873
Uh, those are actually
my dad's skates.

40:12.476 --> 40:15.010
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

40:15.012 --> 40:17.711
It's probably better
than the alternative.

40:17.713 --> 40:20.581
I never cried
once my dad died.

40:20.583 --> 40:23.552
- [thunder rumbles]
- Not once.

40:23.554 --> 40:28.456
What was your last memory
of him? Something good?

40:28.458 --> 40:31.060
I yelled at him that morning.

40:32.161 --> 40:34.729
I was having
a tantrum about I...

40:34.731 --> 40:37.199
[scoffs] I don't even
know what it was about.

40:37.201 --> 40:39.202
It was about nothing.
I was six.

40:40.570 --> 40:42.105
And, um...

40:43.840 --> 40:46.576
...I told him
I didn't love him.

40:49.146 --> 40:50.945
<i>Every morning
was usually the same.</i>

40:50.947 --> 40:52.981
- Bye.
- <i>He'd shake his head</i>

40:52.983 --> 40:56.251
<i>and he'd say, "Bye for now."</i>

40:56.253 --> 40:58.887
He would take the train to work,

40:58.889 --> 41:03.858
unless he was late,
like he was that day

41:03.860 --> 41:07.695
because of me.
So then he took his car.

41:07.697 --> 41:10.231
But if he would have
just taken the train,

41:10.233 --> 41:14.068
<i>then he would have gone east,
and would have been fine</i>

41:14.070 --> 41:17.938
<i>because the shock wave
didn't go that far.</i>

41:17.940 --> 41:21.575
<i>But he, um...</i>

41:21.577 --> 41:24.681
...he took the freeway.

41:26.083 --> 41:27.485
It's...

41:31.655 --> 41:34.255
It's all my fault.

41:34.257 --> 41:36.624
I know that everybody
says that it's not.

41:36.626 --> 41:40.864
You know, that it's his time,
and that it was his...

41:43.900 --> 41:45.603
But it wasn't.

41:48.672 --> 41:52.543
You know, I've never
even been to his grave.

41:54.143 --> 41:55.712
Not once.

41:59.215 --> 42:01.184
How messed up is that?

42:07.724 --> 42:10.691
See this?

42:10.693 --> 42:14.063
All this. You want
to know why I track rems?

42:15.932 --> 42:19.637
Because you want to know
why they show up, right?

42:21.338 --> 42:24.708
No, I want to know
why my dad doesn't.

42:26.143 --> 42:29.079
I mean, all these rems,
every single day, but...

42:30.146 --> 42:32.012
...not him.

42:32.014 --> 42:33.581
[thunder rumbles]

42:33.583 --> 42:35.282
Never him.
And every single day,

42:35.284 --> 42:37.586
I think I'm gonna walk
around the corner

42:37.588 --> 42:41.121
and there he'll be, and it's
all gonna make sense, but...

42:41.123 --> 42:42.692
...never does.

42:43.860 --> 42:47.228
That's what
scares me the most.

42:47.230 --> 42:49.197
I mean...

42:49.199 --> 42:52.670
...him dying, me living,
what if it all means nothing?

42:55.606 --> 42:57.641
That's why I keep looking.

43:03.646 --> 43:05.583
- [knock on door]
- Ron?

43:06.717 --> 43:10.818
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, Ron.

43:10.820 --> 43:14.088
Um, it's so late,
and with the roads icing over,

43:14.090 --> 43:16.324
I thought maybe Kirk
should just stay over.

43:16.326 --> 43:19.293
I made up the sofa bed for him.

43:19.295 --> 43:24.100
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:45.856 --> 43:48.722
It's okay, baby.

43:48.724 --> 43:51.392
[rumbling]

43:51.394 --> 43:54.831
[rattling]

43:58.902 --> 44:02.106
[wind howling]

44:14.751 --> 44:16.653
Ah!

44:17.753 --> 44:19.656
[crunching]

44:30.233 --> 44:33.303
[gasps, pants]

44:37.139 --> 44:40.844
[gasps, screams]

44:43.480 --> 44:45.882
[cracking]

45:01.498 --> 45:05.836
[echoing whispers]

45:10.273 --> 45:13.177
[heart beating]

45:19.916 --> 45:22.816
[screams]

45:22.818 --> 45:26.255
[panting]

45:29.159 --> 45:32.193
Ronnie!
Babe, what's the matter?

45:32.195 --> 45:36.930
Nothing. I... I was
just having a nightmare.

45:36.932 --> 45:39.737
Baby, why is the window open?

45:41.471 --> 45:44.505
What does
"darkness falls" mean?

45:44.507 --> 45:47.342
- What?
- Before you woke up, I heard you saying it.

45:47.344 --> 45:51.278
You kept repeating it.
"Darkness... falls."

45:51.280 --> 45:53.815
Uh, I don't know.

45:53.817 --> 45:57.385
Well, come on downstairs.
Your breakfast is getting cold.

45:57.387 --> 45:59.890
And close that window.

46:11.168 --> 46:14.771
- Morning.
- Hi.

46:15.838 --> 46:17.271
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

46:17.273 --> 46:19.507
Oh, Ronnie,
I wanted to tell you.

46:19.509 --> 46:22.409
I got a call from that office
in Overton I told you about.

46:22.411 --> 46:25.012
And they want me to come in
for a job interview.

46:25.014 --> 46:27.916
It's on the 28th, so I'm
probably going to stay over.

46:27.918 --> 46:29.818
So you're gonna
miss my birthday.

46:29.820 --> 46:32.887
I'm gonna come back
later that afternoon.

46:32.889 --> 46:35.190
So whatever you want us to do,
we can still do, okay?

46:35.192 --> 46:37.894
Okay.

46:41.197 --> 46:44.833
- What?
- That's his chair.

46:44.835 --> 46:47.969
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, you didn't...

46:47.971 --> 46:50.338
- It's okay.
- I didn't know. Should I...?

46:50.340 --> 46:52.840
- Just sit.
- Uh...

46:52.842 --> 46:57.346
It's okay. Really, it's...
Sit there.

47:03.920 --> 47:08.155
I'm so tired.
[yawning] How was the sofa bed?

47:08.157 --> 47:12.392
Did you get any sleep?
Because I definitely didn't.

47:12.394 --> 47:14.595
Oh, it was exhausting.

47:14.597 --> 47:17.398
I had this dream
about Brian...

47:17.400 --> 47:19.166
Ronnie, Ronnie.

47:19.168 --> 47:22.103
You said your dad died in
The Event ten years ago, right?

47:22.105 --> 47:26.007
- Yeah.
- Look at date on the newspaper. It's only eight years old.

47:26.009 --> 47:31.211
What?
Wait, how is that even possible?

47:31.213 --> 47:35.985
- Get me a pen. Get me a pen, quick.
- Yeah.

47:46.329 --> 47:49.099
- How much time do I have?
- Almost.

47:59.675 --> 48:01.378
Done.

48:03.045 --> 48:05.280
Okay. Maybe... maybe
the image changed,

48:05.282 --> 48:07.414
right, or maybe it was there the
whole time, maybe you didn't know,

48:07.416 --> 48:09.117
but either way, Ronnie,

48:09.119 --> 48:12.021
I'm pretty sure he's trying
to warn you.

48:14.556 --> 48:18.392
Okay. I found another article.
This is eight years ago.

48:18.394 --> 48:22.262
Emma Shaw goes missing on the 29th,
Leap Day. Her killer is never found.

48:22.264 --> 48:25.934
But the police believed it was
linked to the disappearance

48:25.936 --> 48:27.635
and murder
of another area girl,

48:27.637 --> 48:31.171
Claire White, who was found dead
February 28th a year earlier.

48:31.173 --> 48:35.510
- Were there any living relatives?
- Uh, no.

48:35.512 --> 48:37.679
Emma Shaw's family moved away,

48:37.681 --> 48:41.083
but Claire White still
has a sister in Aurora.

48:47.222 --> 48:50.358
Claire had this boyfriend,
Brian.

48:50.360 --> 48:52.659
- Last name?
- Never knew it.

48:52.661 --> 48:56.097
Claire and I weren't
all that close before...

48:56.099 --> 49:00.467
Anyway, she was obsessed.

49:00.469 --> 49:03.503
She moved to Chicago only after
a few months to be with him.

49:03.505 --> 49:07.208
I thought things were moving a little
too fast, but that was Claire.

49:07.210 --> 49:09.947
Where did they find her body?

49:13.583 --> 49:16.153
Do you want
to watch her die?

49:21.157 --> 49:25.360
<i>I'll give you the address, but you
might wanna think twice before going.</i>

49:25.362 --> 49:29.032
- [Ronnie] <i>Why is that?</i>
- <i>Because it's in the no-go zone.</i>

49:39.208 --> 49:41.409
[emergency signal
plays on radio]

49:41.411 --> 49:44.311
[over radio] <i>This is an emergency
broadcast alert announcement.</i>

49:44.313 --> 49:46.514
<i>You are entering
a restricted area.</i>

49:46.516 --> 49:49.383
<i>Authorized US government
personnel only.</i>

49:49.385 --> 49:54.155
<i>Turn around now and go
to the nearest checkpoint.</i>

49:54.157 --> 49:57.691
[emergency signal plays]

49:57.693 --> 50:00.494
<i>This is an emergency broadcast
alert announcement.</i>

50:00.496 --> 50:02.796
<i>You are entering

50:02.798 --> 50:05.633
<i>Authorized US government
personnel only.</i>

50:05.635 --> 50:09.506
<i>Turn around now and go
to the nearest checkpoint.</i>

50:13.809 --> 50:16.711
<i>This is an emergency broadcast
alert announcement.</i>

50:16.713 --> 50:20.048
<i>You are entering
a restricted area.</i>

50:20.050 --> 50:22.753
[continues indistinctly]

50:25.422 --> 50:28.592
[static]

50:35.465 --> 50:38.335
You know, you don't
have to do this, Ronnie.

50:42.105 --> 50:44.041
[Ronnie] You coming?

50:56.452 --> 50:58.822
[echoing whispers]

51:04.594 --> 51:06.463
My dream.

51:07.764 --> 51:10.333
I kept saying...

51:12.534 --> 51:14.637
Darkness Falls.

51:19.242 --> 51:20.744
Come on, we got to move.

51:35.157 --> 51:36.659
Hey.

51:49.204 --> 51:53.508
Can you read?

51:53.510 --> 51:58.512
[laughs] Come on, it's not actually electrified.
They're just trying to scare people.

51:58.514 --> 52:01.682
I hope. Yeah, I hope.

52:01.684 --> 52:03.753
I hope.

52:07.556 --> 52:08.692
See?

52:09.925 --> 52:12.659
I got bolt cutters
in my bag.

52:12.661 --> 52:15.898
- Why do you have bolt cutters?
- Don't ask.

53:00.242 --> 53:02.378
Are they all...?

53:04.581 --> 53:06.813
Yeah.

53:06.815 --> 53:10.853
[echoing whispers]

53:46.755 --> 53:49.423
Their loops don't even end.

53:49.425 --> 53:52.994
How is this even possible?

53:52.996 --> 53:55.695
The energy that makes remnants
possible is strongest here

53:55.697 --> 53:58.298
because we're
so close to ground zero.

53:58.300 --> 54:00.501
That's why their loops
seem continuous.

54:00.503 --> 54:04.708
They're not just repeating moments,
they're repeating days, weeks.

54:06.643 --> 54:08.945
Some might even be repeating
their entire lives.

54:39.775 --> 54:42.811
Just keep moving, okay?

54:49.018 --> 54:52.922
[echoing whispers]

55:22.985 --> 55:27.423
- [rattling, laughter]
- [man] Let's get out of here, man.

55:33.663 --> 55:36.731
[Ronnie] Locals.
Definitely not rems.

55:36.733 --> 55:39.566
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

55:39.568 --> 55:40.834
[glass shatters]

55:40.836 --> 55:42.536
- Ronnie, follow my lead.
- What?

55:42.538 --> 55:44.807
Don't say anything.

55:46.576 --> 55:48.677
[man] Yo.

55:50.045 --> 55:52.448
Look at this.

55:54.550 --> 55:56.483
This one's new.

55:56.485 --> 56:00.123
[man 2] Yeah, so what? There's
new ones here every day.

56:07.829 --> 56:09.932
[man 2] Come on, let's go.

56:15.737 --> 56:20.740
[laughter,
speaking indistinctly]

56:20.742 --> 56:24.644
Did we have to be kissing
to make that work?

56:24.646 --> 56:27.884
No, probably not. Come on.

56:32.989 --> 56:35.657
[Ronnie] This is
the address she gave us.

56:37.860 --> 56:40.827
Ronnie,
this is the collider lab.

56:40.829 --> 56:43.665
This is ground zero.

56:52.074 --> 56:54.811
[man] Are you here
to see the ghosts?

57:03.786 --> 57:06.623
There's all kinds
of ghosts here.

57:11.027 --> 57:13.461
We heard you can
watch a girl die.

57:13.463 --> 57:15.565
Money?

57:19.534 --> 57:21.836
You can't miss her.

57:21.838 --> 57:25.139
Go all the way to the back,
then down the stairs.

57:25.141 --> 57:27.610
Have fun.

57:32.481 --> 57:33.817
Freaks.

57:49.097 --> 57:52.067
Shit.

57:55.838 --> 58:00.907
[Ronnie] I don't understand.
I thought this place was a lab.

58:00.909 --> 58:04.079
We must be seeing rems from
before the lab even existed.

58:06.114 --> 58:10.219
In the Great Chicago Fire,
people jumped from the rooftops.

58:18.594 --> 58:21.898
[echoing whispers]

58:30.706 --> 58:34.010
Must have been
a bathhouse at some point.

58:45.688 --> 58:48.691
[Kirk] And a hospital
during the wars.

58:53.094 --> 58:55.797
[echoing shout]

59:09.679 --> 59:13.550
[indistinct chatter]

59:15.351 --> 59:18.820
So what do we do,
just stand around in the dark?

59:20.856 --> 59:24.594
- Yeah, we wait.
- Until what?

59:26.896 --> 59:28.664
That.

59:34.637 --> 59:37.740
[man] Look, here she comes.
I like this.

59:43.045 --> 59:44.880
[man 2] There she is.

59:45.981 --> 59:48.784
[indistinct chatter]

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:05.902
She knew her attacker.

01:00:12.974 --> 01:00:15.811
- [all gasp]
- [grunting]

01:00:18.713 --> 01:00:20.949
[grunting]

01:00:24.219 --> 01:00:26.955
[indistinct shouting]

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:37.900
[yelping]

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:47.210
[gasping]

01:00:49.711 --> 01:00:52.382
- [cracking]
- [gasping]

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.789
[cracking]

01:01:02.324 --> 01:01:07.262
- [loud crack]
- [long exhale]

01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:11.932
[applause]

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:13.702
Let's get out of here.

01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.936
Ronnie.

01:01:16.938 --> 01:01:19.775
Dr. Steiner.

01:01:20.775 --> 01:01:23.145
Martin Steiner.

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:29.083
Kirk!

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:33.222
- Steiner! Dr. Steiner!
- Hey! Wait!

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:42.762
Dr. Steiner!

01:01:42.764 --> 01:01:44.764
- What the hell!
- I'm sorry.

01:01:44.766 --> 01:01:47.803
- Kirk, wait!
- Sorry, I'm sorry! Wait!

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:55.912
- Come on!
- No, no, just wait. Just wait.

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:01.050
[echoing whispers]

01:02:07.088 --> 01:02:10.992
- There he is. Ronnie! Ronnie! Come here.
- Hey! Hey!

01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:22.105
No, no, no. Wait.
Wait. This way.

01:02:29.411 --> 01:02:31.878
Steiner!

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.179
Steiner!

01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:35.182
Come on,
we just want to talk to you!

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:39.219
- About Claire White!
- You should go!

01:02:39.221 --> 01:02:42.456
- And Brian.
- I said go!

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.825
Easy! Okay! We're gonna go!
We're gonna go!

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.325
- Okay, come on.
- You know him!

01:02:46.327 --> 01:02:48.427
- You don't think I'll pull it!
- You know him!

01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:52.800
- Get the hell out!
- You want to shoot me? Well, then shoot me!

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:56.336
Because if I leave here without answers,
then I'm dead anyway. All right?

01:02:56.338 --> 01:02:59.505
You want to make up for
destroying everyone's lives?

01:02:59.507 --> 01:03:06.381
Well, maybe start
by helping save mine. Please.

01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:16.456
[Steiner]
This is where I live now.

01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:21.394
It's... after the explosion,
I... I came back.

01:03:21.396 --> 01:03:25.398
I felt somehow that this is the
only place that I belonged.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.071
I just... Come here.
This way.

01:03:57.432 --> 01:03:59.302
Sit.

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.936
Uh, when, uh,

01:04:02.938 --> 01:04:06.608
when the bombs, uh...

01:04:10.512 --> 01:04:12.912
...over Hiroshima
and Nagasaki,

01:04:12.914 --> 01:04:15.282
people standing near
the explosion

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:19.653
absorbed the radiation as they
were incinerated. Uh, yes.

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:24.157
Their shadows were seared into
the walls for all time. Yes.

01:04:24.159 --> 01:04:28.362
Yeah, you see, death
works like that, you see.

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:32.932
When we die, we leave
an echo of ourselves behind.

01:04:32.934 --> 01:04:37.403
Yes. These echoes, they
can become something more.

01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:39.572
They can become doorways.

01:04:39.574 --> 01:04:43.443
See, a doorway through
which a person can reach back

01:04:43.445 --> 01:04:45.615
and touch the living.

01:04:47.682 --> 01:04:51.217
My... my research was
to understand these doorways

01:04:51.219 --> 01:04:54.521
and... and
ultimately to create one.

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:56.990
You mean create a doorway
between life and death?

01:04:56.992 --> 01:05:00.526
Oh, yes, and vice-versa.
Vice-versa.

01:05:00.528 --> 01:05:05.264
<i>We brought patients to the
brink of death and back.</i>

01:05:05.266 --> 01:05:08.200
<i>In essence, to see if we could
use a living person</i>

01:05:08.202 --> 01:05:11.470
<i>as a vessel
to resurrect the deceased.</i>

01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:13.308
[gasping]

01:05:14.943 --> 01:05:17.276
<i>Unfortunately,
the closer we got,</i>

01:05:17.278 --> 01:05:20.146
<i>the, uh,
the more dangerous it became.</i>

01:05:20.148 --> 01:05:23.550
What happened that day?
The day of The Event?

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:28.124
Instead of building
the doorway...

01:05:30.425 --> 01:05:33.128
...we tore a massive hole.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.170
What about Brian?

01:05:44.172 --> 01:05:47.173
Oh. Brian was
my research assistant.

01:05:47.175 --> 01:05:48.708
<i>He was young, but brilliant.</i>

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:51.311
<i>He was integral
to our work here.</i>

01:05:51.313 --> 01:05:53.646
<i>But something, uh,
after The Event,</i>

01:05:53.648 --> 01:05:56.749
something changed in him.
Something... something broke.

01:05:56.751 --> 01:06:01.121
And... and when I found out
that his girlfriend Claire

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:04.758
ended up murdered,
I knew he did it.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.260
But there have been
others since Claire.

01:06:07.262 --> 01:06:10.731
- Spectral transference.
- [Ronnie] What's spectral transference?

01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:14.467
You see, Brian killed the person
that he loved the most,

01:06:14.469 --> 01:06:19.072
<i>and now he's just
trying to bring them back</i>

01:06:19.074 --> 01:06:21.407
in... in the body of another.

01:06:21.409 --> 01:06:26.112
But Brian's dead. He's a rem,
and a ghost can't kill someone.

01:06:26.114 --> 01:06:31.083
- I mean, the laws...
- The laws are lies, Miss Calder.

01:06:31.085 --> 01:06:35.021
Bedtime stories for children
to shut their eyes.

01:06:35.023 --> 01:06:37.492
[laughs]

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:42.597
He's coming for you now,
isn't he?

01:06:45.099 --> 01:06:49.403
Claire... Claire's birthday
is the day after tomorrow.

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.470
Claire's birthday,
day after...

01:06:51.472 --> 01:06:55.374
So you see, spectral transference
can only, uh, only work

01:06:55.376 --> 01:06:58.644
if the vessel, um, you,

01:06:58.646 --> 01:07:02.382
shares a birthday
with the deceased.

01:07:02.384 --> 01:07:05.684
The day after tomorrow
is my birthday.

01:07:05.686 --> 01:07:12.059
Well, I'm afraid you don't
have much time, then.

01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:14.427
You see,
what you must remember,

01:07:14.429 --> 01:07:20.467
in a world where the dead
walk among the living,

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:23.773
nothing is as it seems.

01:07:30.545 --> 01:07:34.780
There's a price to pay
for knowledge, I've learned.

01:07:34.782 --> 01:07:36.715
Whoa. What are you doing?

01:07:36.717 --> 01:07:39.552
The truth can
be an awful burden.

01:07:39.554 --> 01:07:41.854
We're not gonna say anything.
I promise.

01:07:41.856 --> 01:07:44.692
[laughs]

01:07:47.695 --> 01:07:53.266
This burden
is no longer mine.

01:07:53.268 --> 01:07:54.400
- Wait!
- No, no!

01:07:54.402 --> 01:07:56.538
[gunshot]

01:08:06.681 --> 01:08:09.715
Everything he said, I mean, the
laws, we have to tell everybody.

01:08:09.717 --> 01:08:13.286
Ronnie, look,
Brian is coming for you. Okay?

01:08:13.288 --> 01:08:15.889
What we need to do right now is to keep
you safe for the next 48 hours, then...

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:19.492
And then
we'll tell everyone.

01:08:19.493 --> 01:08:21.627
- Yeah.
- What do we do?

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:23.629
- [school bell rings]
- I don't have much time now.

01:08:23.631 --> 01:08:26.198
We can get you out of here,
go to my aunt's in Bakersville.

01:08:26.201 --> 01:08:28.902
- Yeah, but he could find us.
- Rems stay in the same place.

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:31.770
Rems also aren't supposed to
communicate or change or murder.

01:08:31.773 --> 01:08:33.205
I mean, you heard
what Steiner said.

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:34.473
The laws are lies.

01:08:34.475 --> 01:08:37.410
Ronnie, stop,
I am on your side, okay?

01:08:37.412 --> 01:08:39.411
I'm just trying to figure
this out, the same as you.

01:08:39.412 --> 01:08:43.649
You think you're alone, you're not.
I'm with you. Okay?

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:46.154
Mr. Lane?

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:51.191
Can you open your locker
for us, please?

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:52.392
What's this about?

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:55.361
Open the locker.

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:57.198
Please.

01:09:02.270 --> 01:09:06.639
[man] Step away
from the locker, Mr. Lane.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:09.644
This is ridiculous. I don't know what
you think you're gonna find in there.

01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:16.348
Whoa, no, no, no.
That's not mine.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:18.484
You're gonna have
to come with us, Mr. Lane.

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.553
This is ridiculous.
That's not mine. Hey! Wait!

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:24.723
Easy! Okay, I'm sorry.
Ronnie, that's not my gun.

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:28.328
Get the hell off me!
It's not mine. Ronnie!

01:09:47.849 --> 01:09:52.218
Mr. Bittner! I'm in trouble and I need
help. Okay? I need you to listen to me.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.289
- I know you're probably not gonna believe me, but...
- Ronnie, slow your roll.

01:09:56.291 --> 01:09:58.226
I don't have anyone else
to turn to.

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:00.229
I believe you.

01:10:03.931 --> 01:10:05.201
I believe you.

01:10:07.435 --> 01:10:11.271
Pastor Greer
told me everything.

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:13.339
Bill talked to her
before he died.

01:10:13.341 --> 01:10:15.407
Do you think Brian
could have killed him?

01:10:15.409 --> 01:10:17.410
I'm not sure. I started
doing my own digging.

01:10:17.412 --> 01:10:19.713
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:22.348
We have to tell Kirk. I mean,
he should be out by tonight.

01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:27.454
- You saw what just happened.
- Well, yeah, but that wasn't his gun.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:30.022
I shouldn't tell you this.

01:10:30.024 --> 01:10:33.793
But you do know why Kirk was asked
to leave his last school, right?

01:10:33.795 --> 01:10:38.766
- No.
- They found a gun on him.

01:10:43.838 --> 01:10:47.007
So this was the Dr. Steiner?

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:50.943
- And he didn't say anything else?
- No. That was it.

01:10:50.945 --> 01:10:55.315
If he's right, then running's
not gonna make a difference.

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.750
According to Steiner,
this transference has to happen

01:10:57.752 --> 01:10:59.785
on the day both the vessels
were born.

01:10:59.787 --> 01:11:01.888
If it doesn't happen then,
it won't happen at all. Right?

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:05.424
- Mm-hmm.
- That means the 29th is Brian's window.

01:11:05.426 --> 01:11:08.294
- We'll just have to keep you safe for 24 hours.
- How do we do that?

01:11:08.296 --> 01:11:11.498
- Do you have a panic room?
- Yeah.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:16.572
How would your mother
feel about a slight renovation?

01:11:24.979 --> 01:11:26.481
Hey.

01:11:28.082 --> 01:11:33.388
- Can I help?
- We're good, thanks.

01:11:34.956 --> 01:11:38.325
Ronnie, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:40.362
Please?

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:43.632
Yeah.

01:11:46.467 --> 01:11:49.102
Why didn't you
answer my calls? Huh?

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:50.937
Come on. You know
the gun wasn't mine.

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:54.941
How do I know that?
Seriously?

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:58.547
Kirk, why did you get kicked
out of your last school?

01:12:00.515 --> 01:12:03.516
- Please, just tell me the truth.
- Ronnie. That was different.

01:12:03.518 --> 01:12:07.890
- Okay?
- How was that different? Because the gun was yours?

01:12:11.626 --> 01:12:13.492
No, hey, Ronnie,
please listen.

01:12:13.494 --> 01:12:17.496
Please listen to me. I was
never gonna hurt anyone.

01:12:17.498 --> 01:12:22.602
- Then why would you have it?
- Because I was gonna hurt myself.

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:26.675
Please, Ronnie. It was just a mistake.
You have to believe me.

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:31.811
I... I don't know what
to believe anymore.

01:12:31.813 --> 01:12:33.649
Ronnie.

01:12:45.092 --> 01:12:49.963
Hi. Anna Calder for Mr. Lawrence.
We talked on the phone.

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:53.034
- Have a seat, Ms. Calder.
- Thank you.

01:12:57.139 --> 01:12:59.406
[Mr. Bittner] <i>We're gonna
turn that panic room</i>

01:12:59.408 --> 01:13:03.445
<i>into a shelter
no remnant can get into.</i>

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.820
<i>The metal disrupts
spectral energy,</i>

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:16.625
<i>which should make it harder
for Brian to pass through.</i>

01:13:23.131 --> 01:13:28.434
<i>It's a sealant. Rems tend to emerge
more clearly in cooler climates.</i>

01:13:28.436 --> 01:13:31.006
<i>You want to keep out
the cold air.</i>

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:39.012
<i>Don't worry, Ronnie,
we're going to keep Brian out.</i>

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:42.518
It's ugly,
but it should do the trick.

01:13:43.885 --> 01:13:45.951
Yeah.

01:13:45.953 --> 01:13:48.687
We're gonna be here a while, so
I'll run out and get us some grub.

01:13:48.689 --> 01:13:52.090
- You gonna be okay alone for a bit?
- Yeah.

01:13:52.092 --> 01:13:55.093
- Or you could come with me.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

01:13:55.095 --> 01:13:58.164
I, um,
I think I feel safer here.

01:13:58.166 --> 01:14:01.534
Ronnie, it's going
to be okay.

01:14:01.536 --> 01:14:03.771
You sure?

01:14:05.105 --> 01:14:06.873
No.

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:09.576
No, I'm actually
incredibly scared right now.

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:14.013
But if you stay strong for me,
that would be tremendous.

01:14:14.015 --> 01:14:15.951
Back in a flash.

01:14:38.672 --> 01:14:40.876
That's not possible.

01:14:44.512 --> 01:14:47.813
Damn it, Ronnie!
Pick up the phone!

01:14:47.815 --> 01:14:49.251
Shit!

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:03.228
- Mr. Lawrence, hi.
- Ms., uh... Calder?

01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:06.199
So nice to put the face
to the voice.

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:08.000
Ms. Calder, I don't know
how to tell you this,

01:15:08.002 --> 01:15:11.706
but, uh, I've never spoken
with you before in my life.

01:15:18.279 --> 01:15:19.648
Come on!

01:15:21.682 --> 01:15:25.820
[horn honking]

01:16:56.377 --> 01:17:00.178
[screaming]

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:02.683
[thunder crashes]

01:17:08.288 --> 01:17:10.889
[Kirk] <i>Listen to me. It's Bittner.
He worked with Steiner.</i>

01:17:10.891 --> 01:17:15.697
<i>His daughter died in The Event.
Bittner was Steiner's partner.</i>

01:17:23.404 --> 01:17:26.173
[rumbling]

01:17:28.342 --> 01:17:30.677
- [alarm blaring]
- [shouting]

01:17:30.679 --> 01:17:33.379
Eva!
We've got to go now, baby!

01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:35.815
Go to the bunkers,
just like we practiced!
