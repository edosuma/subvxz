us again, right?

16:32.450 --> 16:35.244
I'm guessing neither

16:32.450 --> 16:35.244
one of you confessed.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.038
Headmare Twilight

16:35.286 --> 16:38.038
say wait here.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.041
Maybe they're changing their

16:38.080 --> 16:41.041
minds about sending us home.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.084
Why would they?

16:42.126 --> 16:44.462
Face it. We're stuck here.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.715
But, but, I

16:44.504 --> 16:47.715
have to go home!

16:47.757 --> 16:50.718
My mom makes the

16:47.757 --> 16:50.718
best kelp fritters.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.012
How can you be so

16:50.760 --> 16:53.012
cool about this?

16:54.180 --> 16:55.097
We're mad.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.390
We just show it

16:55.139 --> 16:56.390
differently.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.309
More like you don't

16:56.432 --> 16:58.309
show it at all.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.228
What pony getting at?

17:01.270 --> 17:03.523
Maybe it wasn't

17:01.270 --> 17:03.523
just one prankster.

17:03.564 --> 17:05.566
Maybe there were

17:03.564 --> 17:05.566
three of you.

17:05.608 --> 17:09.111
And you're trying to hide

17:05.608 --> 17:09.111
your guilt by not being upset!

17:09.153 --> 17:11.906
It does make sense.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.908
Guys, stop it.

17:13.950 --> 17:17.704
Or maybe whoever did it is

17:13.950 --> 17:17.704
only pretending to be upset.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.079
To throw us off.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.248
Me? But I didn't!

17:21.290 --> 17:23.125
Come on, let it go.

17:23.167 --> 17:28.715
[loud arguing]

17:28.756 --> 17:31.718
Come on, Ocellus,

17:28.756 --> 17:31.718
you know you did it!

17:31.759 --> 17:33.093
Just fess up!

17:33.135 --> 17:38.516
[shouting continues]

17:38.558 --> 17:40.935
I said stop fighting!

17:40.977 --> 17:43.145
That's not what the

17:40.977 --> 17:43.145
holidays are about.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.065
No matter what you call

17:43.187 --> 17:46.065
them, or how you celebrate.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.778
Do you know how

17:48.484 --> 17:50.778
lucky you all are?

17:50.820 --> 17:53.239
With your stories about

17:50.820 --> 17:53.239
sharing, and kindness,

17:53.280 --> 17:54.574
and getting together

17:53.280 --> 17:54.574
with everycreature

17:54.615 --> 17:55.909
that you care about?

17:57.284 --> 17:59.579
But... Griffons do

17:57.284 --> 17:59.579
that too, don't they?

17:59.620 --> 18:03.416
Some holiday

17:59.620 --> 18:03.416
about a moon?

18:03.457 --> 18:05.125
Blue Moon Festival.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.212
The one time of year

18:05.167 --> 18:08.212
when Griffons are

18:05.167 --> 18:08.212
nice to each other.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.631
Well, as nice as we can be.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.177
<i>Families get together to</i>

18:12.174 --> 18:15.177
<i>eat and then complain</i>

18:12.174 --> 18:15.177
<i>about the food.</i>

18:15.219 --> 18:17.555
<i>And give each other</i>

18:15.219 --> 18:17.555
<i>presents they don't like.</i>

18:17.597 --> 18:19.933
<i>And mostly just try not</i>

18:17.597 --> 18:19.933
<i>to yell at each other.</i>

18:19.974 --> 18:22.769
Well, at least you get

18:19.974 --> 18:22.769
to be with your family!

18:22.810 --> 18:24.270
No...

18:24.311 --> 18:25.813
Because I don't have a family.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.150
[Sandbar]<i> What about</i>

18:27.857 --> 18:30.150
<i>Grandpa Gruff?</i>

18:30.192 --> 18:31.235
[Gallus]<i> That's just his name.</i>

18:31.277 --> 18:33.362
<i>He's not anygriff's</i>

18:31.277 --> 18:33.362
<i>actual grandpa.</i>

18:35.782 --> 18:38.367
<i>I felt like I never had</i>

18:35.782 --> 18:38.367
<i>a place in Griffonstone.</i>

18:41.746 --> 18:46.292
Then I came here,

18:41.746 --> 18:46.292
and well, met all of you.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.544
So I don't want to

18:46.333 --> 18:48.544
go home for the break.

18:48.586 --> 18:51.422
And that's why I did it.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.801
[gasp] Griffon mess

18:51.464 --> 18:54.801
up decorations?

18:54.842 --> 18:55.927
Yeah.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.136
It was me.

18:57.177 --> 18:59.430
I put goo powder in

18:57.177 --> 18:59.430
the Fire of Friendship.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.181
[gasps]

19:01.223 --> 19:03.559
So it wasn't Ocellus?

19:03.601 --> 19:06.562
Why would you ruin

19:03.601 --> 19:06.562
things for us?

19:06.604 --> 19:08.230
I didn't plan to!

19:08.272 --> 19:09.816
I just figured if I

19:08.272 --> 19:09.816
made a mess,

19:09.857 --> 19:12.401
our teachers would make

19:09.857 --> 19:12.401
us stay to clean up.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.403
We'd be together

19:12.443 --> 19:14.403
a little longer.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.948
Well. It worked, didn't it?

19:16.990 --> 19:18.282
Better than I thought.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.993
When Headmare Twilight

19:18.324 --> 19:19.993
threatened to cancel

19:20.034 --> 19:23.537
winter break, that

19:20.034 --> 19:23.537
meant I would get to

19:20.034 --> 19:23.537
be with all of you,

19:23.579 --> 19:25.456
through the entire holiday!

19:25.498 --> 19:27.583
That's why I didn't confess.

19:27.625 --> 19:30.294
So why are you

19:27.625 --> 19:30.294
admitting this now?

19:30.336 --> 19:34.214
I hated seeing all you fighting

19:30.336 --> 19:34.214
and blaming each other.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.217
That's the opposite of what

19:34.256 --> 19:37.217
all your holidays mean.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.761
Except maybe yours, Smolder.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.557
I can't keep all of you from

19:41.263 --> 19:43.557
the happiness of your homes

19:43.599 --> 19:45.685
and families just

19:43.599 --> 19:45.685
because I feel bad.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.229
I'm sorry.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.899
Don't worry, you won't

19:49.271 --> 19:51.899
have to tell our teachers.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.233
I will.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.319
[Twilight] You don't have to.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.570
We already know.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.741
We kinda guessed

19:58.280 --> 20:00.741
it was you.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.536
But we wanted to give you

20:00.783 --> 20:03.536
the chance to tell the truth.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.038
I'm proud that you did.

20:05.079 --> 20:06.914
And I'm glad to see you've

20:05.079 --> 20:06.914
been paying attention

20:06.956 --> 20:09.834
in Professor Applejack's

20:06.956 --> 20:09.834
honesty classes.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.961
But you're still gonna

20:09.876 --> 20:11.961
have to make amends.

20:12.003 --> 20:16.049
And stay over break for

20:12.003 --> 20:16.049
extra friendship lessons,

20:12.003 --> 20:16.049
by yourself.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.259
I'll stay with him.

20:19.301 --> 20:20.636
Me, too!

20:20.678 --> 20:22.513
Yona stay also!

20:22.555 --> 20:23.806
I'm staying!

20:26.059 --> 20:27.393
What?

20:27.434 --> 20:28.853
All right.

20:28.895 --> 20:32.523
I guess pony holidays

20:28.895 --> 20:32.523
can't be that bad.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.358
Now you can finally

20:32.565 --> 20:34.358
know what it's like

20:34.400 --> 20:37.570
to spend Hearth's Warming with

20:34.400 --> 20:37.570
friends who care about you.

20:39.572 --> 20:43.076
Looks like they don't really

20:39.572 --> 20:43.076
need any extra lessons.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.078
Since you obviously know

20:43.117 --> 20:45.078
that Hearth's Warming

20:45.119 --> 20:47.747
is about coming

20:45.119 --> 20:47.747
together, I'd be honored

20:47.788 --> 20:50.416
if all of you would

20:47.788 --> 20:50.416
join my friends as guests

20:50.457 --> 20:51.667
at our holiday table.

20:51.709 --> 20:55.421
[happy chatter]

20:55.462 --> 20:57.590
After we finish cleaning up.

20:57.631 --> 20:59.842
[chattering]

21:04.638 --> 21:07.391
Hey, this reminds

21:04.638 --> 21:07.391
me of another story!

21:07.433 --> 21:12.980
The Time I Almost Spilled

21:07.433 --> 21:12.980
Grape Juice on the White Couch.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.399
Does it have a

21:13.022 --> 21:15.399
depressing ending?

21:15.441 --> 21:17.735
I'm not sure pony

21:15.441 --> 21:17.735
stories work that way.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.949
Gallus want Yona

21:20.404 --> 21:22.949
