WEBVTT

00:01.737 --> 00:04.577
(Karen)
Oh, my God.
You're, like, agoraphobic.

00:04.609 --> 00:05.379
Really?
Yeah!

00:05.412 --> 00:08.117
You would rather
sit on your couch

00:08.150 --> 00:09.253
and watch
a Phillies game

00:09.286 --> 00:11.391
then go out to a movie
with your awesome girlfriend.

00:11.424 --> 00:12.458
Absolutely correct.

00:12.493 --> 00:13.595
Later, Jim.

00:13.627 --> 00:15.765
Kev, have a good weekend.
Bye.

00:15.798 --> 00:18.405
Okay, so this is
what's gonna happen.

00:18.437 --> 00:19.273
You're gonna
suck it up...
Here we go.

00:19.306 --> 00:21.077
and we're gonna go
to dinner...
Okay.

00:21.111 --> 00:22.146
And then we're gonna go
to the movies.

00:22.178 --> 00:23.615
Sounds good.
Hey, Halpert!

00:25.285 --> 00:26.386
Hey.

00:30.394 --> 00:31.431
Roy!
Ahh!

00:31.463 --> 00:32.566
Roy, don't!

00:32.599 --> 00:35.804
[screams]
God!

00:35.839 --> 00:39.446
[people coughing]

00:41.684 --> 00:44.422
Pam, please call security.

00:44.456 --> 00:46.694
Every day for eight years,

00:46.727 --> 00:48.497
I have brought
pepper spray into this office

00:48.530 --> 00:51.403
to protect myself
and my fellow employees.

00:51.436 --> 00:53.407
And every day
for eight years,

00:53.440 --> 00:55.544
people have laughed at me.

00:55.578 --> 00:58.218
Well.
Who's laughing now?

01:04.530 --> 01:05.062
No need for consternation.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.471
Everything is under control.

01:08.505 --> 01:09.507
(Jan on speakerphone)
Michael, three days ago

01:09.540 --> 01:10.741
one of your employees

01:10.774 --> 01:12.646
attacked another employee
in your office.

01:12.678 --> 01:14.582
It was a crime
of passion, Jan,

01:14.617 --> 01:16.553
not a disgruntled employee.

01:16.586 --> 01:18.691
Everyone here
is extremely gruntled.

01:18.725 --> 01:20.494
[sighs]
Is Toby there?

01:20.529 --> 01:21.531
No.

01:21.563 --> 01:23.468
I'm here, Jan.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.739
Wh-what is
the situation, Toby?

01:25.772 --> 01:28.377
Well, we fired Roy,
obviously.

01:28.411 --> 01:30.915
And Jim won't press charges
against Roy or the company.

01:30.948 --> 01:32.585
Thank God.
Yeah.

01:32.618 --> 01:35.692
Um, but now apparently
Darryl has some issue with--

01:35.725 --> 01:38.465
No, he has been wanting a raise
for a couple of months

01:38.497 --> 01:41.237
and he's just using
this Roy thing as leverage.

01:41.271 --> 01:42.605
All right, well, are
you gonna take care of this?

01:42.638 --> 01:43.975
Yeppers.

01:44.007 --> 01:47.483
What did I tell you
about "yeppers?"

01:47.515 --> 01:49.519
I don't remember.

01:49.552 --> 01:51.757
I told you not to say it.
Do you remember that?

01:51.791 --> 01:53.995
Ye--sh.

01:56.966 --> 01:59.606
(Pam)
I really don't want
to talk about it.

01:59.639 --> 02:01.576
I don't mean to be rude,

02:01.611 --> 02:05.351
but I just--I don't want
to comment on what happened.

02:07.422 --> 02:09.827
It sucked.

02:11.796 --> 02:13.501
(Jim)
I guess...

02:13.534 --> 02:15.904
all things considered...

02:15.938 --> 02:19.078
I was lucky
Dwight was there.

02:19.110 --> 02:21.584
And Roy was lucky that Dwight
only used pepper spray,

02:21.616 --> 02:24.523
and not the nunchucks
or the throwing stars.

02:24.556 --> 02:29.533
[typing on keyboard]

02:29.566 --> 02:32.439
Hey, man, I never got
a chance to thank you.

02:32.473 --> 02:34.542
"Thank you" not necessary,
and thus not accepted.

02:34.577 --> 02:38.115
I saw someone breaking
the law, and I interceded.

02:38.148 --> 02:39.786
Okay.

02:39.820 --> 02:43.093
Um...got you something.

02:43.125 --> 02:44.696
Don't want it.
Won't open it.

02:44.729 --> 02:45.764
Don't need it.
Won't take it.

02:45.798 --> 02:48.103
Citizens do not accept
prizes for being citizens.

02:48.135 --> 02:51.343
[continues typing]

02:53.145 --> 02:55.050
No, don't call me a hero.

02:55.082 --> 02:57.456
Do you know who the real
heroes are?

02:57.489 --> 02:59.627
The guys who wake up
every morning

02:59.659 --> 03:01.664
and go into their normal jobs,

03:01.696 --> 03:03.835
and get a distress call
from the commissioner,

03:03.868 --> 03:05.804
and take off their glasses
and change into capes,

03:05.838 --> 03:08.042
and fly around
fighting crime.

03:08.076 --> 03:09.646
Those are the real heroes.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.184
I cannot believe
I missed the fight.

03:12.218 --> 03:13.420
It was crazy.

03:13.455 --> 03:14.457
Man.

03:14.489 --> 03:17.629
You saw it?
Describe it, please.

03:19.732 --> 03:21.637
Well...

03:21.670 --> 03:23.607
I heard some shouting.

03:23.641 --> 03:25.611
And I look over,
and Roy's by reception.

03:25.645 --> 03:27.815
And you could just tell
he's gonna punch somebody.

03:27.848 --> 03:29.619
Jim says something.

03:29.653 --> 03:30.922
Roy stomps all over there.

03:30.955 --> 03:32.056
All of a sudden--bam!

03:32.091 --> 03:33.760
Roy goes down,
and Dwight's standing there

03:33.794 --> 03:34.896
like an action hero.

03:34.930 --> 03:36.567
Oh!

03:36.601 --> 03:40.207
It was insane.

03:40.240 --> 03:43.814
Well...good for Dwight.

03:43.847 --> 03:45.519
Okay, I want you
to be Darryl

03:45.552 --> 03:46.753
and ask me
for a raise,

03:46.786 --> 03:47.922
because I need to try out

03:47.956 --> 03:49.759
some of these
negotiation tactics on you.

03:49.792 --> 03:50.928
Where'd you get that?

03:50.962 --> 03:52.231
Wikipedia.

03:52.264 --> 03:55.871
Wikipedia is
the best thing ever.

03:55.904 --> 03:57.643
Anyone in the world

03:57.676 --> 04:00.481
can write anything they want
about any subject.

04:00.481 --> 04:02.752
So you know
you are getting

04:02.785 --> 04:05.123
the best possible
information.

04:05.156 --> 04:07.896
Okay, Darryl,
ask me for a raise.

04:07.928 --> 04:09.733
Hey, Mike, since Roy left

04:09.766 --> 04:10.735
I've been doing
a lot more work,

04:10.768 --> 04:11.571
and I need a raise.

04:11.603 --> 04:13.975
Hmm, well, that's
interesting, Darryl.

04:14.008 --> 04:15.879
I think...

04:15.912 --> 04:17.915
[muttering]
that maybe you should...

04:17.948 --> 04:20.689
[mumbling]
I can't hear you.

04:20.721 --> 04:23.059
What I'm saying is that...

04:23.093 --> 04:25.864
[mumbling]

04:25.899 --> 04:28.337
Still nothing.

04:28.369 --> 04:31.743
Okay, see what I did?
No.

04:31.777 --> 04:34.683
By leaning back
and by whispering,

04:34.717 --> 04:37.689
I established a dominant
physical position.

04:37.723 --> 04:39.225
Nice.

04:39.258 --> 04:40.762
Okay, let's try
another one.

04:40.794 --> 04:42.264
(Dwight)
I removed my weapon

04:42.297 --> 04:44.235
from its secure
hiding place.

04:44.268 --> 04:45.739
Discharged it
at a distance

04:45.772 --> 04:47.141
of a little
over a meter,

04:47.174 --> 04:51.684
rendering him utterly
and completely disabled.

04:51.717 --> 04:54.790
The end.

04:54.822 --> 04:56.159
Thanks, Dwight.

04:56.192 --> 04:58.765
That is the bravest thing
I have ever heard.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.601
I can't imagine
what I would've done.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.971
I do.

05:02.003 --> 05:03.975
You would've left me
to fend for myself.

05:04.007 --> 05:05.745
Like the time we were
on the Ferris wheel

05:05.778 --> 05:06.881
and that kid dropped
a milkshake on me

05:06.913 --> 05:08.149
and you just laughed.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.352
Well, that was funny.
That's why.

05:09.385 --> 05:10.855
Oh, it was?
Mm-hmm.

05:10.888 --> 05:11.857
Okay, well, the next time
that you get scared

05:11.890 --> 05:13.393
that you think a murderer
is in your apartment

05:13.427 --> 05:14.762
in the middle
of the night

05:14.796 --> 05:15.965
and you call me
to calm you down...

05:15.999 --> 05:17.669
Can you stop?

05:17.703 --> 05:19.707
Because I'm not gonna do it
anymore, Ryan, I'm not.

05:19.740 --> 05:21.776
There's a bunch of people
back there maybe.

05:21.811 --> 05:23.078
I call you
in the middle of the night

05:23.112 --> 05:25.082
to tell you
that I love you.
Guys?

05:25.116 --> 05:27.455
(Toby)
I don't think Michael
intended to punish me

05:27.487 --> 05:30.729
by putting Ryan back here
with Kelly.

05:30.762 --> 05:36.104
But if he did
intend that...wow.

05:36.138 --> 05:37.174
Genius.

05:37.207 --> 05:38.778
[knock on door]
Yeah.

05:38.811 --> 05:40.046
You ready for me?

05:40.079 --> 05:42.786
Yes, yeah, absolutely.
Have a seat.
Cool.

05:42.819 --> 05:45.257
You know what?

05:45.290 --> 05:46.926
Actually, let's go
into the conference room.

05:46.961 --> 05:48.798
Okay.
No, you know what?
Let's stay here.

05:50.902 --> 05:53.273
No, let's go to the con--

05:53.306 --> 05:55.478
Yeah, let's go
to the conference room.

05:55.510 --> 05:57.281
[door opens]

05:57.314 --> 05:59.887
Tactic number six.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.957
Change the location
of the meeting

06:01.990 --> 06:03.158
at the last second.

06:03.193 --> 06:05.498
Totally throws 'em off.

06:12.945 --> 06:14.782
[exhales]

06:14.817 --> 06:19.325
Number 14.
Declining to speak first.

06:19.358 --> 06:20.995
Makes them feel
uncomfortable,

06:21.028 --> 06:22.464
puts you in control.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.508
[inhales deeply]

06:27.541 --> 06:30.280
I am declining
to speak first.

06:30.313 --> 06:31.851
Okay, I'll start.

06:31.884 --> 06:33.085
It's pretty
simple really.

06:33.118 --> 06:36.124
I, um, I think
I deserve a raise.

06:36.158 --> 06:38.396
I'm scheduled to get one
in six months,

06:38.430 --> 06:40.902
but I'd like that
to be moved up to now.

06:40.935 --> 06:44.341
Hmm.

06:44.375 --> 06:46.881
Ohh, Darryl.

06:46.914 --> 06:50.855
You are a good worker
and a good man.

06:50.889 --> 06:54.897
I just--you know,
times are tight.

06:57.034 --> 06:58.938
And I just don't think

06:58.971 --> 07:00.841
corporate's going to go
for this right now.

07:00.841 --> 07:02.144
Are you wearing
lady clothes?

07:02.176 --> 07:04.014
What?

07:04.048 --> 07:06.652
Are you wearing
lady clothes?

07:06.686 --> 07:08.223
Those look like
lady pants.

07:09.992 --> 07:11.896
No, this is a power suit.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.967
That there's
a woman's suit.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.306
I do not buy women's clothes.
[Darryl laughs]

07:17.340 --> 07:19.511
Would not make
that mistake again.

07:19.546 --> 07:21.683
I'm gonna call Roy, man.
Okay.

07:21.715 --> 07:22.986
This is gonna make him
feel better.
All right.

07:23.018 --> 07:24.320
[laughs]
This is too good!

07:24.354 --> 07:26.091
All right, you know what?

07:26.125 --> 07:27.996
Pam, would you please
tell Darryl

07:28.028 --> 07:30.667
that this is not
a woman's suit.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.370
Oh, my God.
That's a woman's suit.

07:32.404 --> 07:33.639
You're wearing
a woman's suit?

07:33.674 --> 07:36.546
No, I do--
I wear men's suits.

07:36.580 --> 07:38.083
Okay, I got this
out of a bin.

07:38.116 --> 07:40.053
There were these huge
bins of clothes,

07:40.087 --> 07:42.592
and everybody was rifling
through them like crazy,

07:42.625 --> 07:45.531
and I grabbed one.

07:45.564 --> 07:47.101
And it fit.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.071
So I don't think

07:49.105 --> 07:51.742
that is totally
just a woman's suit.

07:51.775 --> 07:54.048
At the very least
it's bisexual.

07:54.081 --> 07:55.416
Who makes it?

07:57.253 --> 07:59.993
Um, MISSterious.

08:00.027 --> 08:02.030
And it is mysterious,

08:02.064 --> 08:03.166
because the buttons
are on the wrong side.

08:03.199 --> 08:04.536
That's the mystery.

08:04.569 --> 08:05.770
(Phyllis)
It's got shoulder pads.

08:05.804 --> 08:07.341
And did you see
that lining?

08:07.374 --> 08:09.712
Okay, would you
stop it, please?

08:09.745 --> 08:11.414
Michael, the pants don't
have any pockets.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.053
No, they don't.
See?

08:13.085 --> 08:14.388
[chuckling]

08:14.420 --> 08:17.294
Negotiations are all about
controlling things.

08:17.326 --> 08:20.633
About being
in the driver's seat.

08:20.668 --> 08:24.440
And...you make one
tiny mistake, you're dead.

08:24.474 --> 08:26.746
I made one tiny mistake.

08:26.779 --> 08:28.783
I wore women's clothes.

08:31.556 --> 08:34.161
So Karen, how do you feel

08:34.195 --> 08:36.431
that Roy tried to kick
your boyfriend's ass

08:36.464 --> 08:38.335
over another woman?

08:38.368 --> 08:41.374
I feel great, Kevin.
Thank you.

08:41.408 --> 08:43.412
What happened exactly?

08:43.445 --> 08:44.749
I wasn't here,

08:44.781 --> 08:47.520
so I haven't really
heard the whole story.

08:47.555 --> 08:49.726
Um, well, Jim and I
were talking.

08:49.759 --> 08:51.294
Mm-hmm.

08:51.329 --> 08:53.532
And Roy walked in
looking super angry.

08:53.567 --> 08:56.272
And he's a big dude,
you know?

08:56.304 --> 08:57.274
And all of a sudden,

08:57.306 --> 08:58.809
Jim pushed me
out of the way.

08:58.844 --> 09:01.081
And Roy cocked his fist.

09:01.081 --> 09:02.283
And then--bam!

09:02.317 --> 09:05.290
Dwight sprays him
and knocks him on his butt.

09:05.322 --> 09:09.765
[breathing heavily]
Goodness.

09:14.875 --> 09:16.846
Sorry I almost
got you killed.

09:16.879 --> 09:18.650
Yeah.

09:18.684 --> 09:19.885
That was nuts.

09:19.919 --> 09:23.359
It's just so stupid.

09:23.392 --> 09:26.331
I mean, getting back
with Roy and everything.

09:26.365 --> 09:30.272
I mean, what
was I thinking, right?

09:30.307 --> 09:31.743
No, I mean, you guys
really seem

09:31.775 --> 09:33.814
to have a strong connection.

09:33.847 --> 09:35.449
Not anymore.

09:35.482 --> 09:39.225
It's, um...
it's completely over now.

09:40.392 --> 09:41.930
[chuckles]
We'll see.

09:41.962 --> 09:43.366
I'm sure you guys'll...

09:43.398 --> 09:45.970
find your way
back to one another someday.

09:46.003 --> 09:47.473
Jim...

09:49.510 --> 09:51.315
I am really...sorry.

09:51.349 --> 09:53.653
Oh, yeah.
Don't worry about it.

09:57.361 --> 09:59.331
I'm going to give you
a piece of paper.

09:59.365 --> 10:02.304
I want you to write down
how much you want,

10:02.337 --> 10:04.441
then I want you to slide it
back across the desk to me.

10:08.382 --> 10:09.651
No, slide--slide it, yes.

10:09.686 --> 10:11.755
There you go.

10:13.627 --> 10:15.563
Oh...
[scoffs]

10:15.597 --> 10:17.267
Come on...be serious.

10:17.301 --> 10:18.970
I am serious, Mike.
That's a 10% raise.

10:19.003 --> 10:20.005
That's what I want.

10:20.039 --> 10:21.309
I can't give you that.

10:21.342 --> 10:23.279
I-I don't make this much.

10:23.313 --> 10:24.681
Come on,
be for real, Mike.

10:24.715 --> 10:25.751
I don't.

10:25.784 --> 10:27.586
I'll prove it to you.

10:27.621 --> 10:30.794
There is a pay stub.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.537
[laughs]

10:35.569 --> 10:37.541
Are you serious?
You're earning this?

10:37.573 --> 10:39.009
Plus perks, yes.

10:39.044 --> 10:41.048
Mike, this is barely
more than I make.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.616
You've been here
ten years, dog.

10:42.651 --> 10:44.388
[laughing]

10:44.421 --> 10:45.390
14 years.

10:45.423 --> 10:46.425
Hoho!

10:46.459 --> 10:48.027
No, please--
please don't--

10:48.062 --> 10:48.964
Oh, sorry, Mike.

10:48.997 --> 10:50.934
Some of my folks got
to hear about this one.

10:50.968 --> 10:52.504
Ah.
[laughing]

10:52.536 --> 10:54.007
Okay, let's take 15 again.

10:54.039 --> 10:55.677
[closes drawer]

10:55.710 --> 10:57.714
A boss's salary
isn't just about money.

10:57.747 --> 10:59.049
It is about perks.

10:59.084 --> 11:01.321
It--for example,

11:01.321 --> 11:04.395
every year,
I get a $100 gas card.

11:04.428 --> 11:06.532
Can't put a price tag
on that.

11:06.564 --> 11:07.534
Michael.

11:07.566 --> 11:08.568
Hmm?

11:08.603 --> 11:09.906
Here's the, uh,
$15 I owe you.

11:09.938 --> 11:11.409
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.

11:11.441 --> 11:12.845
I heard
you might need it.

11:12.877 --> 11:16.585
So...just take it.

11:16.618 --> 11:19.926
Yeah, I heard how much
Michael makes.

11:19.959 --> 11:22.531
I still think
he's way overpaid.

11:22.563 --> 11:24.668
Okay, here's
the straight dope.

11:24.701 --> 11:26.571
No tricks, no Wikipedia.

11:26.605 --> 11:27.573
What?

11:27.607 --> 11:28.776
I talked to corporate,

11:28.809 --> 11:30.480
and they told me

11:30.512 --> 11:33.586
that I can only
give you a 5% raise.

11:33.618 --> 11:34.788
That's 'cause of you, Mike.

11:34.821 --> 11:36.024
They're not gonna give
the working man

11:36.058 --> 11:37.427
more than the boss.

11:37.461 --> 11:38.463
Well, what am I
supposed to do?

11:38.496 --> 11:40.198
Get your own raise.

11:40.231 --> 11:42.704
You gotta get out there
and earn, son.

11:42.737 --> 11:44.441
I'm not gonna go out
and ask for a raise right now.

11:44.475 --> 11:46.111
That is ridiculous.

11:46.143 --> 11:49.184
You gotta call your girl...
and get paid.

11:49.216 --> 11:51.522
Show her who wears the pants
in the relationship.

11:51.555 --> 11:53.125
You know what?
I deserve a bump.

11:53.157 --> 11:54.595
Make it happen, Captain.

11:57.066 --> 12:00.171
I am makin' it happen...
Sergeant.

12:02.611 --> 12:04.147
Okay, if you don't
want a gift,

12:04.180 --> 12:05.650
at least let me
buy you a beer

12:05.682 --> 12:06.585
or lunch or something.

12:06.618 --> 12:08.656
When Han Solo
returns to the Death Star

12:08.688 --> 12:09.859
in the Millennium Falcon

12:09.891 --> 12:13.231
and shoots down the TIE fighters
and saves the rebel cause...

12:13.265 --> 12:15.569
do you think he does so
for a free beer?

12:15.602 --> 12:18.042
Boy, I--
No.

12:18.075 --> 12:19.610
And why are you so interested
in buying me something, Jim?

12:19.645 --> 12:22.717
What's your angle?

12:22.751 --> 12:25.823
I've never asked for a raise
in 14 years.

12:25.858 --> 12:27.795
This is long overdue.

12:27.827 --> 12:29.297
I wanna do it today.

12:29.329 --> 12:30.431
(Jan)
Today? All right.

12:30.465 --> 12:33.172
Well, uh, listen,
because of our, uh, situation,

12:33.204 --> 12:35.543
we're gonna need to have
a third party present.

12:35.577 --> 12:37.647
Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.

12:37.681 --> 12:39.316
D-Darryl
from the warehouse?

12:39.349 --> 12:41.622
Mm-hmm.
No, Michael.

12:41.655 --> 12:43.826
We--we need an H.R. rep.

12:43.859 --> 12:46.599
So uh, you should
just bring Toby.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.636
Hey...I'd rather
kill myself.

12:48.669 --> 12:50.573
Michael, he's your branch's
H.R. rep.

12:50.607 --> 12:52.711
Toby is terrible.
And we need someone else
in the room

12:52.744 --> 12:55.116
Toby is the worst
human being
because of our relationship.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.952
I've ever known--
You know this.
Michael!

12:56.985 --> 12:59.190
Either Toby comes with you,
or we don't do it.

13:04.936 --> 13:06.671
Toby, come on, let's go.

13:06.705 --> 13:08.075
Where?
Where?

13:08.108 --> 13:09.610
I'm gonna smack you in the head
with a hammer.

13:09.645 --> 13:12.349
Come on, let's go.

13:12.383 --> 13:14.587
All right.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.138
[R&B playing on radio]

13:23.172 --> 13:27.213
[imitating Chris Tucker]
Don't ever touch
a black man's radio!

13:27.245 --> 13:29.383
Chris Tucker.
Rush Hour.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.020
You know?

13:33.024 --> 13:35.262
I won't touch yours,
by the way.

13:35.296 --> 13:37.032
Thank you.
Well...

13:37.065 --> 13:38.769
And then all of a sudden,
Dwight stood up

13:38.803 --> 13:40.306
and was like, "No!"

13:40.339 --> 13:42.009
Then what'd he do?

13:42.042 --> 13:43.444
Well, you should just
read the report that Toby did.

13:43.477 --> 13:44.748
He took everyone's stories.

13:44.781 --> 13:46.284
[telephone ringing]

13:46.318 --> 13:50.391
Okay, it seems here
that you ordered

13:50.426 --> 13:52.462
12,000 reams of paper.

13:52.495 --> 13:53.833
Oh, 12 reams.

14:08.462 --> 14:09.397
Hey, guys.

14:09.429 --> 14:13.205
Jan is ready for you.

14:13.237 --> 14:14.406
[sighs]
Okay.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.542
Okay, bring it home now.

14:15.576 --> 14:17.948
And don't forget the new
black man phrase I taught you.

14:17.981 --> 14:19.483
Pippity poppity,
give me the zoppity.

14:19.517 --> 14:21.922
Yes, sir!
Remember that.

14:21.956 --> 14:23.458
I'll be right outside
if you need me.

14:23.491 --> 14:25.061
All right.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.940
I want him to get the raise.

14:30.974 --> 14:32.343
I...just can't
help myself.

14:32.375 --> 14:34.014
[door opens]

14:43.497 --> 14:45.971
Hey, man, uh...

14:46.003 --> 14:47.505
I'm sorry.

14:59.364 --> 15:01.267
Thanks.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.424
Can I, like...

15:13.457 --> 15:15.562
see you after work
for coffee or something?

15:15.595 --> 15:18.034
I don't know.

15:18.068 --> 15:20.572
Please.

15:20.605 --> 15:23.078
I just got some stuff
I gotta say to you.

15:31.693 --> 15:33.331
Jim!

15:33.365 --> 15:35.235
Roy.
Look out!

15:35.268 --> 15:37.907
Thanks, Kev.
I'm...good, though.

15:37.942 --> 15:41.113
First off, Michael,
this a salary negotiation.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.952
All matters regarding
our personal relationship

15:42.985 --> 15:44.454
have to be set aside.

15:44.487 --> 15:45.621
Are we clear?

15:45.656 --> 15:47.325
Bippity boppity.

15:48.627 --> 15:50.599
Right now, we can
offer you a 6% raise.

15:50.631 --> 15:52.403
6%?
Mm-hmm.

15:52.436 --> 15:53.505
After all
we've been through?

15:53.538 --> 15:56.643
Oh, God.
I got you jade earrings.

15:56.678 --> 15:58.515
Michael--
No. No.

15:58.548 --> 15:59.649
Michael--
No.

15:59.684 --> 16:01.320
You're gonna play
it like this?

16:01.353 --> 16:03.124
You give me a good raise,

16:03.158 --> 16:04.693
or no more sex.

16:08.002 --> 16:09.704
What are you writing,
perv-ball?

16:09.736 --> 16:12.276
Just preparing
for the deposition.

16:12.310 --> 16:14.414
This may be the first time
that a male subordinate

16:14.447 --> 16:17.453
has attempted to get
a modest, scheduled raise

16:17.485 --> 16:20.626
by threatening to withhold sex
from a female superior.

16:20.658 --> 16:23.431
It will be
a groundbreaking case...

16:23.465 --> 16:25.601
when it inevitably
goes to trial.

16:27.140 --> 16:29.577
I'm so sorry, Pammy.

16:29.609 --> 16:31.413
I really wasn't
gonna do anything.

16:31.447 --> 16:35.556
But then I...kept thinking
about you two together, and...

16:37.493 --> 16:39.429
I just thought you guys
were really good friends or...

16:39.463 --> 16:43.605
or maybe he was gay
or something.

16:43.638 --> 16:45.609
Not that that's wrong.

16:48.381 --> 16:50.485
I'm sorry too.

16:51.688 --> 16:52.590
I just--

16:52.623 --> 16:56.363
I think that we both
made some bad choices.

16:59.604 --> 17:02.042
So you gonna start
datin' Halpert, then?

17:02.042 --> 17:05.682
Um...no.

17:05.715 --> 17:07.553
No, he has a girlfriend.

17:07.586 --> 17:09.590
Oh, yeah.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.867
Wait a minute, you broke off
our wedding for the guy.

17:14.900 --> 17:17.373
No.

17:17.406 --> 17:20.545
There were
a lot of reasons.

17:20.579 --> 17:23.752
You mean you're not even
gonna try to go out with him?

17:30.699 --> 17:32.603
What's this?

17:32.636 --> 17:33.871
What's what?

17:33.905 --> 17:35.475
"Certificate of Bravery

17:35.508 --> 17:36.843
"from the Scranton
Police Department.

17:36.878 --> 17:39.717
"Recognizing
outstanding citizenship

17:39.750 --> 17:42.589
from a very brave young man,
Dwight K. Schrute"?

17:42.623 --> 17:44.859
Wow, I guess word
got around.

17:44.894 --> 17:46.398
That's a nice honor.

17:46.430 --> 17:48.668
Please, they hand these
out to little kids.

17:48.702 --> 17:50.772
Look, there's a teddy bear
in a policeman's cap.

17:50.806 --> 17:53.912
Mm...didn't think
you'd notice.

17:53.944 --> 17:56.218
[wads paper up]

17:56.251 --> 17:57.686
What's wrong with you?

17:58.688 --> 18:02.162
Ohh.
It was a weird day.

18:02.162 --> 18:04.500
I accidentally
cross-dressed.

18:05.869 --> 18:07.673
And then Darryl
made me feel bad

18:07.706 --> 18:09.643
for not making any money.

18:09.677 --> 18:11.748
And then I had to ride up here
with stupid Toby.

18:11.780 --> 18:13.252
And then--

18:13.284 --> 18:14.654
Okay, Michael...

18:14.687 --> 18:17.660
I can offer you
a 12% raise.

18:17.693 --> 18:18.894
But...

18:18.928 --> 18:21.868
you have got
to ask for 15.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.242
That's ridiculous.
I'm never gonna make--

18:25.276 --> 18:26.578
No, just...

18:26.610 --> 18:28.914
[quietly]
I just need you
to ask for it...

18:28.948 --> 18:30.985
so I can record
that you asked for it.

18:31.019 --> 18:33.725
'Kay?

18:33.758 --> 18:35.829
Ah, so...

18:36.931 --> 18:38.768
All right, Levinson.

18:38.802 --> 18:42.776
I would like a 15% raise.

18:42.810 --> 18:44.780
No! But we can
offer you 12.

18:44.814 --> 18:46.351
But you just said 15.

18:46.384 --> 18:47.786
[pen hits table]

18:47.820 --> 18:51.026
(Michael)
Negotiation is an art.

18:51.058 --> 18:53.731
Back and forth,
give and take.

18:53.765 --> 18:57.806
And today, both Darryl and I
took something.

18:57.840 --> 19:01.548
Higher salaries.
Win, win, win.

19:01.580 --> 19:04.719
But, you know,
life is about more

19:04.754 --> 19:06.890
than just salary.

19:06.924 --> 19:10.064
It's about...perks.

19:10.096 --> 19:11.733
Like having sex with Jan.

19:11.768 --> 19:13.337
Michael!

19:17.077 --> 19:19.449
Dwight.

19:22.755 --> 19:24.759
I've been doing some
very interesting reading.

19:24.793 --> 19:26.597
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:26.631 --> 19:27.799
Tales of bravery.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.870
Hmm. Good stuff?

19:29.904 --> 19:31.773
Mm-hmm.

19:31.807 --> 19:33.712
I was thinking tonight,
we could...

19:33.744 --> 19:35.982
read it together.

19:36.016 --> 19:37.986
That sounds...

19:38.020 --> 19:42.061
fun.

19:53.518 --> 19:54.887
[scoffs]

19:54.920 --> 19:58.694
I...

19:58.727 --> 20:01.767
will never say a word.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.806
And now... we are even.

20:09.215 --> 20:11.185
I graduated from anger
management the same way

20:11.220 --> 20:13.925
I graduated from Cornell... on
time.

20:13.957 --> 20:15.996
Now I'm back,
got a second chance,

20:16.028 --> 20:17.766
and I'm not gonna blow it.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.836
So look out,
Dunder-Mifflin!

20:19.869 --> 20:21.808
[laughs]

20:21.840 --> 20:23.945
I mean "look out"
in a fun way.

20:23.978 --> 20:26.215
You know, not like,
"I'm gonna hurt you."

20:26.250 --> 20:28.522
Hey, guys!

20:28.555 --> 20:29.990
Guess who's back?

20:30.024 --> 20:31.528
Aah! Aah!

20:31.561 --> 20:33.597
[screaming]

20:33.632 --> 20:35.234
Ohh, God!

20:35.267 --> 20:36.770
No need to thank me.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.941
I am not a hero.

20:38.975 --> 20:41.648
I am a mere defender of the
office.

20:41.681 --> 20:43.251
You know who's a real hero?

20:43.283 --> 20:45.255
Hiro from "Heroes."

20:45.287 --> 20:48.126
That's a hero.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.564
Also Bono.
