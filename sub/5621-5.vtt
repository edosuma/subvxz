Addison.

Mitch.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.193
How long have I been out?

00:28.195 --> 00:31.130
You've been in a coma
for almost two years.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.532
And I've slept here every night.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.900
Alone?

00:34.902 --> 00:37.169
You know me too well.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.204
What do the doctors say?

00:39.206 --> 00:41.206
Do you mind turning that off?

00:41.208 --> 00:43.575
Oh. No. Why? Do we have to?

00:43.577 --> 00:47.346
Listen to me, defeat is
a temporary condition.

00:47.348 --> 00:50.582
Giving up is what
makes it permanent.

00:50.584 --> 00:54.019
I think, deep down,
what kept me alive

00:54.021 --> 00:56.755
was knowing
that you were out there...

00:56.757 --> 00:58.424
grinding.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.426
And what kept me grinding

01:00.428 --> 01:03.262
was knowing
that you were in here,

01:03.264 --> 01:05.130
being kept alive.

01:07.535 --> 01:11.303
¶ ¶

01:15.743 --> 01:16.943
So, for you, it's about the...

01:16.944 --> 01:18.344
Yeah, it kind of is.
Okay.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.046
Oh, will you say
"Grinder rests"?

01:21.048 --> 01:22.448
Grinder rests!

01:22.450 --> 01:25.484
Yes! Yes! Mmm...

01:30.024 --> 01:32.124
Hey, you guys got a second?

01:32.126 --> 01:33.292
Yeah.
Yeah, what's up, buddy?

01:33.294 --> 01:34.626
Just working
something out in my head

01:34.628 --> 01:36.428
and I wanted to get your spin
on it.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.729
Okay.
Shoot.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.232
Her name's Brie.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.267
And, I don't know,
I was thinking about

01:42.269 --> 01:43.469
pulling the trigger
and asking her out.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.471
Uh, no, I-I
didn't realize...

01:45.473 --> 01:47.106
you liked somebody.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.807
Maybe bring her over,
watch a movie?

01:48.809 --> 01:49.942
STEWART:
Uh,

01:49.944 --> 01:51.243
yeah. Sure.
Yeah.

01:51.245 --> 01:53.145
We look forward to meeting her.
Yeah.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.114
Cool. Thanks, guys.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.049
Are you kidding me?

01:57.051 --> 01:58.951
Ethan is allowed to date
and I'm not?

01:58.953 --> 02:00.085
Why? Why is that?

02:00.087 --> 02:01.386
Is it because he's a boy?

02:01.388 --> 02:02.788
No, honey.
No. I mean, he's a boy,

02:02.790 --> 02:03.889
but that's...
He is a boy.

02:03.891 --> 02:04.923
STEWART: But he's also...

02:04.925 --> 02:06.458
He's Ethan.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.726
You know?
Like, it's...

02:07.728 --> 02:10.095
He's Ethan.
He's Ethan.

02:10.097 --> 02:12.364
I need to go calm myself down.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.269
He's not asking to go on a date.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.670
No.
It's like a playdate.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.172
He's like...
Have a little friend come over.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.007
A little... you know...
They're gonna, you know,

02:22.009 --> 02:24.243
make popcorn or something.
You... he's like
a little you.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.244
He's like a little me, you know?

02:25.246 --> 02:27.012
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

02:27.014 --> 02:29.081
And when I was that age, I
didn't... I didn't try things.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.650
No.
You know? I didn't...
I didn't have moves.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.952
Oh, God, no.
I'm sure you did not.
Well, you don't have to be

02:33.954 --> 02:36.655
so definitive about it.
I developed moves
Well... No, I'm just...

02:36.657 --> 02:39.424
not long after that.
I got moves.
Yeah. Oh, you got moves.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.460
How did my arm get
here? That's a move.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.128
I didn't even realize
that went up there.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.429
That's the move. Come here.
What else? What else?

02:44.431 --> 02:45.431
I'll show you more.

02:45.432 --> 02:48.333
Oh, yeah? Mmm.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.303
I will never have
what you two have.
Oh, my gosh.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.471
That was terrifying.
Wow, just right there.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.639
Do you think that some people

02:53.641 --> 02:55.474
are destined to never find love?

02:55.476 --> 02:57.342
Because you had
a couple of bad dates?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.111
No, I've had one bad date.

02:59.113 --> 03:01.180
The same bad date
that I've been having

03:01.182 --> 03:04.483
ever since<i> The Grinder</i> became
a staple of the culture.
You...

03:04.485 --> 03:06.118
you think it's a staple
of the culture?
Whole...

03:06.120 --> 03:07.019
whole culture.
These women

03:07.021 --> 03:08.120
don't want to...

03:08.122 --> 03:09.855
make love to me.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.857
They want to have...

03:10.858 --> 03:11.858
a filthy one-night stand

03:11.859 --> 03:13.525
with The Grinder, so they can...

03:13.527 --> 03:15.294
tell their friends about it.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.196
What a nightmare
that must be for you.

03:17.198 --> 03:20.299
It's a nightmare you're
never gonna have to endure.

03:20.301 --> 03:23.302
You lucky son of a bitch.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.003
DEBBIE:
<i>You know, I do</i>

03:25.005 --> 03:27.973
actually feel sorry for him.
I'm sorry. What was that?

03:27.975 --> 03:30.242
It sounds like you said
you feel bad for Dean?

03:30.244 --> 03:32.844
Think about it. Every woman
he ever meets, he has to wonder

03:32.846 --> 03:35.147
if she only likes him
because he's famous.
Oh,

03:35.149 --> 03:36.648
that's not true. I'm sure
a lot of women like him

03:36.650 --> 03:38.917
because he's absurdly
handsome and rich.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.352
(program resumes)

03:40.354 --> 03:41.353
But think about it this way:

03:41.355 --> 03:42.588
The sooner he finds love,

03:42.590 --> 03:44.523
the sooner he moves out
of our house.

03:44.525 --> 03:47.059
Now, that I like.
That was good.
Right? Yeah, that brought

03:47.061 --> 03:48.594
you right in.
Honey, why didn't
you open with that?

03:48.596 --> 03:50.529
I just thought of it.
Well, babe, that... I mean,

03:50.531 --> 03:52.164
how do we do that?
I want to do that.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.432
What's-what's the first step?
I don't...

03:53.434 --> 03:54.766
Can we, like, set him up
with someone?

03:54.768 --> 03:57.169
Is there someone
from before he was famous?

03:57.171 --> 03:59.071
That's a great area.
Let's explore that.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.372
High school?
Like someone from high school?

04:00.374 --> 04:01.840
Gail Budnick.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.575
Gail... Budnick.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.344
They went to prom together.
That is perfect.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.412
And then, you know, he went
to L.A. and became The Grinder,

04:07.414 --> 04:09.748
and she stayed here and she got
married but then her marriage

04:09.750 --> 04:11.283
fell apart
and we handled the divorce.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.851
And, honey, she holds up.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.853
She holds up.
Does she hold up?

04:14.855 --> 04:17.389
You got to see her.
I mean, she looks...
I got, I got to see it?

04:17.391 --> 04:19.057
Her body, it's like... (mutters)
Tell me more.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.559
Just... I'm excited for Dean.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.294
I'm excited for Dean!
You seem very excited.

04:22.296 --> 04:25.330
I'm so happy for him! Oh,
my God, this is perfect, honey!

04:27.868 --> 04:30.936
Hey, Dean.
Uh, what are you doing?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.405
That is the question, isn't it?

04:33.407 --> 04:35.073
Yeah,
that's-that's why I asked it.

04:35.075 --> 04:37.242
Todd, why are you here?

04:37.244 --> 04:40.879
I'm here in case
he wants to bounce ideas off me.

04:40.881 --> 04:45.183
Dean, I have someone here who I
think you'll be excited to see.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.122
G-Gail?

04:50.124 --> 04:51.890
Hi!
Gail Budnick!

04:51.892 --> 04:55.294
Yes. Oh, my goodness. Dean.
What?! Who did this?

04:55.296 --> 04:56.628
Did you do this?
I did.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.497
He did, he did.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.431
TODD:
Wow, what is...

04:59.433 --> 05:01.233
happening?
Oh, um,

05:01.235 --> 05:04.636
a million years ago,
Dean and I were kind of an item.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.672
More than an item,
right? I mean, uh,

05:06.674 --> 05:09.241
I gave Gail my virginity, Todd.

05:09.243 --> 05:10.275
He did.
Mm.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.610
(whispers): I still have it.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.578
Keep it.
(chuckles)

05:13.580 --> 05:15.981
You look exactly the same.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.816
Thank you. So do you.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.852
Really, in a... in a kind of
a scary way the same.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.288
Thank you.
So what-what are you doing
back here?

05:23.290 --> 05:25.924
I-I heard you were in Hollywood
and you became

05:25.926 --> 05:27.693
a big ol' actor, right?

05:27.695 --> 05:31.330
Dean has been The Grinder
for the past eight years.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.998
The Grinder. What is...

05:33.000 --> 05:35.767
You haven't seen the show?

05:35.769 --> 05:36.635
Oh, that's a show?

05:36.637 --> 05:38.103
TODD:
Not just a show.

05:38.105 --> 05:40.172
It's a friggin' staple
of our culture.

05:40.174 --> 05:43.175
It's called<i> The Grinder?</i>
That's the title of it?

05:43.177 --> 05:44.509
<i>The Grinder?</i>
Yeah.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.644
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.878
Was that always the title?

05:46.880 --> 05:47.646
Yeah.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.714
I'm sorry. I...

05:48.716 --> 05:50.716
I don't own a television, so...

05:50.718 --> 05:52.684
I'm more of a book girl.

05:52.686 --> 05:53.952
Did you hear that, Stew?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.854
She's more of a book girl.
Mm-hmm.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.723
Doesn't own a television.

05:57.725 --> 06:00.692
Yeah. No, I-I've been standing
here the whole conversation.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.227
Yeah, you have.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.528
You know, Dean, our firm

06:03.530 --> 06:05.297
handled Gail's divorce.

06:05.299 --> 06:06.965
Oh, that's very unfortunate.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.234
Mm. It was for the best.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.641
Todd, I think it's time we go.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.643
I'm doing good.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.879
I... No, I think we got a
little work to do in the office

06:20.881 --> 06:23.148
you were talking about.
I like watching.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.151
I think we should...
get to... get to work.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.153
I feel warm.
We should leave
the room, Todd.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.675
Okay.
Let's go, please.
Thank you. All right.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.200
STEWART:
<i>They really hit it off.</i>

06:42.202 --> 06:43.201
And she's never seen the show.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.203
Never even seen it.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.771
Doesn't own a television.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.406
Oh, she's one of those.
Yeah, but, like, in a cool way.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.574
Yeah?
Hon, I'm telling you,
it worked, okay?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.276
Dean is all in.
And she's all in?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.844
Mm-hmm.
It's kind of fast, right?
I mean,

06:52.846 --> 06:54.746
does that seem
a little desperate?
Deb,

06:54.748 --> 06:57.282
don't poke holes. This is good.
This is what we want.
Okay.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.251
I mean, we like her.
All right.
I'll take your word for it.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.520
Thank you for not putting
a damper on what's been

07:01.522 --> 07:02.921
the best day I've had in weeks.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.389
Actually...

07:04.391 --> 07:05.457
What? No. What actually?
No...

07:05.459 --> 07:06.892
Just a thought.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.527
Are we being unfair to Lizzie?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.028
Because she pressed me on
the whole double standard thing

07:10.030 --> 07:11.430
today, honey, and I got to say

07:11.432 --> 07:12.798
she made some
really good points.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.433
But... it's Ethan.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.935
Did you tell her that?
Of course. Of course I did.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.805
But she kept hammering me,
and... you know,

07:19.807 --> 07:23.208
after you say "it's Ethan"
a couple dozen times,

07:23.210 --> 07:26.311
it starts to feel pretty thin.
Deb, you have
to stay strong.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.813
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.748
Stew, do you have a sec?
Uh, yeah. Always.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.216
No time is inappropriate.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.951
Okay, 'cause I hate
to spring this on you.

07:32.953 --> 07:36.621
But is there any way that
you could cover for me at work?

07:36.623 --> 07:37.889
I'm thinking
of whisking Gail away

07:37.891 --> 07:38.957
for a couple days.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.759
Wow, that's serious.
Wow!

07:40.761 --> 07:42.794
Uh, well, that's gonna be a...

07:42.796 --> 07:44.563
a big loss at-at the office...

07:44.565 --> 07:46.331
And I'm<i> so</i> sorry. I don't want
to leave you in the lurch.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.567
No, no. You won't.
Let me just... Give me a second.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.435
If I figure it out...
Claire could cover

07:50.437 --> 07:51.937
the thing there, and then Todd

07:51.939 --> 07:53.472
could do the other thing,
then I could stay late

07:53.474 --> 07:56.107
a couple of nights, and
then I think it could work.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.576
'Cause I<i> could</i> hold off...

07:57.578 --> 07:59.311
No, don't hold off.
He could hold off.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.313
We'll make it work,
we'll figure it out
somehow, we'll all

08:01.315 --> 08:02.647
pull together to make
this happen for you.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.616
Great. Great. Thanks.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.851
You know what?
How about this?

08:05.853 --> 08:08.153
Next week I cover for you.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.155
Don't do that.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.756
Ah, no. I insist.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.191
Oh... thanks, Dean.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.993
¶ Hey, now ¶

08:14.995 --> 08:17.829
¶ You better listen to me,
every one of you ¶

08:17.831 --> 08:21.299
¶ We've got a lot,
a lot, a lot, a lot of work ¶

08:21.301 --> 08:23.034
¶ To do, uh! ¶

08:23.036 --> 08:24.803
¶ Today you're working ¶
Terrific. Thank you very much.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.004
¶ For the man ¶ Got it.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.772
¶ ¶

08:27.774 --> 08:29.307
¶ Whoa, oh, oh ¶

08:29.309 --> 08:31.710
¶ Oh, oh... ¶

08:31.712 --> 08:32.811
Okay, 2:00.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.946
All right, I will see you
on Tuesday. Done.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.515
Nice!
Whoo!

08:36.517 --> 08:37.716
Whoo!

08:37.718 --> 08:39.217
(both chuckle awkwardly)

08:40.521 --> 08:43.121
¶ 'Cause you're working
for the man ¶

08:44.124 --> 08:46.558
¶ Working for the man ¶

08:46.560 --> 08:48.326
STEWART:
<i>Before we get started,</i>
<i>just a...</i>

08:48.328 --> 08:51.997
a huge thank-you
for a super productive week.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.466
It was... very refreshing
to get back into the rhythms

08:54.468 --> 08:56.468
of an actual law firm again.
Good morning.

08:56.470 --> 08:58.136
DEAN SR.:
Deano! Where you been?

08:58.138 --> 08:59.871
Yeah, I been texting
you all week, player.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.506
I've been avoiding your texts
all week, player,

09:01.508 --> 09:03.475
'cause, well, when
you're in love,

09:03.477 --> 09:05.343
texting the third banana at work

09:05.345 --> 09:07.145
just seems sort of meaningless.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.047
I get that.
So it's going well, huh?

09:09.049 --> 09:11.917
Let me put it to you this way.

09:11.919 --> 09:15.086
Love is a tapestry
furnished by...

09:15.088 --> 09:17.055
I'm sorry, Claire,
is this weird for you to hear?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.390
Oh, not at all.
'Cause of our thing.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.824
I want to be respectful.

09:19.826 --> 09:20.892
We never had a thing.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.227
You're being so cool
about all this.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.562
So cool.
You are very cool.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.030
DEAN: And, Stew,
thank you,

09:25.032 --> 09:26.932
for reintroducing me
to the love of my life.

09:26.934 --> 09:27.934
This is...

09:27.935 --> 09:29.734
the realest thing
that I've ever felt.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.835
DEAN SR.: Deano,
I'm getting the chills

09:30.837 --> 09:32.537
just hearing you talk about it.

09:32.539 --> 09:33.238
Me, too.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.406
And thank you

09:34.408 --> 09:35.907
for popping in
to tell us about it.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.776
Where are you off to now?
You gonna go back

09:37.778 --> 09:39.344
to Gail's, or maybe you got

09:39.346 --> 09:40.779
another trip somewhere?

09:40.781 --> 09:43.014
Oh, n-no, no. I want to start
pulling my weight around here.

09:43.016 --> 09:45.517
I feel terrible about
how much time I've
been away, as it is.

09:45.519 --> 09:47.185
What are we into?

09:47.187 --> 09:49.287
Well, uh, we're, um...

09:49.289 --> 09:52.123
we're talking about
this civil suit...
Oh! There was nothing civil

09:52.125 --> 09:54.759
about the suit Gail
had on the other day.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.361
We went up to the lake, and...

09:56.363 --> 09:57.696
I'm so sorry, Claire...

09:57.698 --> 09:59.064
It's totally fine.
I could give a...

09:59.066 --> 10:00.465
You're being so cool about this.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.967
So cool.
You really are.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.735
STEWART:
<i>I mean, sure, he hijacked</i>

10:03.737 --> 10:05.103
the staff meeting
and then went on and on

10:05.105 --> 10:06.871
about her bathing suit,
but, honey,

10:06.873 --> 10:09.307
I think we're really headed
in the right direction.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.243
I mean, he's, like, a week
away from legitimately
moving in with her.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.779
Oh, great. Maybe
he can buy her a TV.
Babe,

10:14.781 --> 10:16.414
we are Team Budnick
in this house.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.550
DEAN: Um, excuse me.
Lizzie just downloaded me

10:18.552 --> 10:20.652
on this whole dating thing,
and I got to tell you,

10:20.654 --> 10:22.287
it doesn't sound like
equal treatment to me.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.756
I think you'd better let her go
on the date with Zadak.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.492
You think that?
Or either that, or cancel
Ethan's date with Brie.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.561
ETHAN:
That's a nonstarter over here.

10:29.563 --> 10:32.097
I got Brie locked down
for Friday.
So I'll say it again.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.798
I think the Zadak date
needs to happen.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.266
LIZZIE:
Thank you, Uncle Dean,

10:35.268 --> 10:37.302
for being the only one
who understands me.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.004
Guys, Uncle Dean does not get
to weigh in on this,

10:39.006 --> 10:40.238
because Uncle Dean
is not a parent.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.240
All right, this is not the way

10:42.242 --> 10:43.908
I wanted this to come out.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.411
Um, but since you've
backed me into a corner,

10:46.413 --> 10:48.313
I will move my announcement up

10:48.315 --> 10:49.948
to right now.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.017
Everybody...

10:52.019 --> 10:54.119
I'm gonna be a father.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.921
OTHERS: What?!
DEAN: I know. It came
as a total surprise

10:56.923 --> 10:58.657
to me, too.
Wait, Gail is pregnant?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.824
When did this happen?

10:59.826 --> 11:00.825
Stew, Gail's not pregnant.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.093
We've been together for a week.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.628
How does that timeline
even work?

11:03.630 --> 11:04.630
It doesn't work.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.797
No. She has a son

11:05.799 --> 11:07.365
from her pervious marriage,

11:07.367 --> 11:09.434
and... she's decided
that it's time

11:09.436 --> 11:10.502
for me to meet him

11:10.504 --> 11:13.938
and... essentially, raise him.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.473
As my own.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.709
Oh.
So you just chose
to phrase that

11:17.711 --> 11:19.477
in the most misleading
way possible.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.180
The most<i> dramatic</i> way possible.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.615
DEBBIE: Hm.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.455
Oh, no, Dean!

11:30.457 --> 11:31.990
Are you okay?

11:31.992 --> 11:34.659
I'm so sorry.
I should have been here.
I'm fine, Todd.

11:34.661 --> 11:35.694
I'm just exhausted.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.495
This parenting thing
is rewarding,

11:37.497 --> 11:39.064
but... takes it out of you.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.466
Want to knock off early?
Sounds like that kid you met

11:41.468 --> 11:43.234
three days ago is
really running you ragged.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.704
No, I can't let a law firm
go down the tubes just because

11:45.706 --> 11:47.972
my son had a fever and I
was up all night with him.

11:47.974 --> 11:50.075
So you're calling him
your son now?
Claire,

11:50.077 --> 11:53.712
you have been so ridiculously
cool up until this point,

11:53.714 --> 11:55.747
but to imply that
Toby can't be my son

11:55.749 --> 11:58.383
because we're not
related is hurtful.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.250
That's out of bounds.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.852
That's not what I said.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.587
And I would never say that,
because I'm adopted.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.656
Bulletproof response.
I'm backing off it.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.057
I was just surprised
that you felt

12:06.059 --> 12:07.926
such a strong bond so quickly.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.027
But if you're serious,

12:09.029 --> 12:10.195
I guess that's great.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.597
I feel like if I had
stayed in Boise,

12:12.599 --> 12:14.165
this is the life I would've had.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.935
Maybe it's not too late for me
to have a life like yours, Stew.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.603
That's nice, Dean.
<i>And</i> I got to be The Grinder,

12:18.605 --> 12:20.105
so I got to have all
that other stuff.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.439
Almost better in a way, right?

12:21.441 --> 12:22.607
Yeah, in a way.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.109
Now that I'm a parent,

12:24.111 --> 12:25.777
I have loads

12:25.779 --> 12:27.078
of new respect for what

12:27.080 --> 12:28.680
you guys do...
It is the hardest job

12:28.682 --> 12:29.948
in the world.
You know, you don't

12:29.950 --> 12:32.183
always make the right decisions,
but you're in there,

12:32.185 --> 12:33.785
and you're just...
Uh, what do you mean?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.353
Debbie reached out to me,

12:35.355 --> 12:36.955
still conflicted about
the Lizzie thing and...

12:36.957 --> 12:38.790
She did?
So I bounced
it off Gail,

12:38.792 --> 12:40.792
and she felt exactly
the same way.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.193
You got to give them
both equal treatment.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.295
That's what-what Gail felt?
We all felt.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.430
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.966
Okay.
I'm gonna take a nap
in your office.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.267
Hey, please hold my calls.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.237
Has he ever even
gotten a call here?

12:52.239 --> 12:53.538
I've called him here.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.741
What? You said
equal treatment,

12:56.743 --> 12:59.210
and-and that's equal treatment.
You know that that
is not what I meant.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.279
I did not mean for Lizzie
to babysit Ethan.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.714
Well, what I heard from you

13:02.716 --> 13:05.150
and Lizzie and Dean
and Gail Budnick...

13:05.152 --> 13:06.651
Okay.
was that it had
to be equal.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.820
And what I see in there
is an equal double date.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.722
I'm gonna go see how
they're doing on popcorn.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.657
Great.

13:12.659 --> 13:16.060
STEWART:
Whoa! What is going on!

13:16.062 --> 13:17.328
What? What?
What's happening?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.563
STEWART: They were...
they were making out!

13:18.565 --> 13:19.964
Ethan!
What?

13:19.966 --> 13:21.566
"What?" This-this is not...

13:21.568 --> 13:23.401
this is not supposed to happen.
No, no, no.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.969
I made my intentions
pretty clear.

13:24.971 --> 13:26.971
Yeah. I knew
what he was all about.

13:26.973 --> 13:27.806
What were you...

13:27.808 --> 13:30.241
But hey, it's Ethan, so...

13:30.243 --> 13:32.343
This whole thing, this
is over. Brie, you need
to go call your mom,

13:32.345 --> 13:33.645
'cause you're
going home.
Sorry about this, Brie.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.079
Go call Judy,
and I'll sort this out.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.314
DEBBIE: Are you
gonna sort it out?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.282
Get upstairs.
Call Judy.

13:37.284 --> 13:38.349
We're gonna talk
about this later.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.518
And, you, Zadak, go home!

13:40.520 --> 13:41.920
He didn't do anything.
Why do I have to leave?

13:41.922 --> 13:43.154
Because you do.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.756
Let's go.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.701
Kid's got some moves, huh?

13:56.703 --> 13:59.037
Zadak! Zadak!
Go home.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.605
DEBBIE:
<i>How are you so happy</i>

14:00.607 --> 14:03.341
right now? Were you not just
in the same house with me,

14:03.343 --> 14:05.543
where we caught our child
making out with another child?

14:05.545 --> 14:07.779
Oh, I was in the same house
as you, Deb, and I am

14:07.781 --> 14:08.847
not happy about that...
But, honey,

14:08.849 --> 14:10.381
I've left that at home.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.016
I brought my happy face tonight.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.552
We are so close.
We're not here to pull threads.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.721
We're here to have a nice dinner
and watch Dean fake-parent

14:16.723 --> 14:18.056
his pretend kid.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.657
Hey!
Hey!
There they are.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.659
Oh, Gail is cooking up a storm,

14:21.661 --> 14:23.895
and Toby should be up
from his nap any minute.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.330
Oh, oh, oh!

14:25.332 --> 14:27.498
No shoes.
We are a socks-only household.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.233
Seriously?

14:28.235 --> 14:29.235
Yeah.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.368
We read an article.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.271
Oh. Thank you.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.742
<i>So, we were in the middle
of the fair,</i>

14:37.744 --> 14:39.410
and Toby just had a meltdown.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.745
Uh-oh.
Well, he wanted to
ride that Scrambler

14:40.747 --> 14:42.513
again and again,

14:42.515 --> 14:43.748
and I had
an appointment.
I just said, "You go,"

14:43.750 --> 14:44.916
then I took the boy Yeah.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.718
On the Scrambler
three more times.
Oh!

14:46.720 --> 14:48.219
Don't tell Mom.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.088
Aah! I'm not hearing this.
It's my baby. That's my baby.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.856
And then we just met back here.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.858
Well, I thought your car
was back at the house.

14:53.860 --> 14:55.140
We used Toby's car.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.395
Toby has a car?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.097
If you can call it that.
That's a whole...

14:59.099 --> 15:00.431
Because that,

15:00.433 --> 15:01.833
I don't even know what that is.

15:01.835 --> 15:03.768
I-I thought
Toby was your son.

15:05.372 --> 15:05.871
Yeah.

15:05.872 --> 15:06.371
I'm sorry.
I don't, I don't,

15:06.373 --> 15:07.906
I don't understand.
What up?

15:07.908 --> 15:10.241
God, I slept forever.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.442
It was a crazy day.

15:11.444 --> 15:12.677
Oh.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.848
Oh, this is... Toby?

15:16.850 --> 15:18.449
Mm-hmm.
Last I checked.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.118
This is an adult man.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.020
Right.
Pop, why didn't you wake me?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.588
You need your rest.
Mm-hmm.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.590
And you look so
adorable when you sleep.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.358
Oh, he's cutest.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.362
Mmm.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.038
TOBY:
Sucks I overslept.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.140
I was looking forward
to meeting you guys, but...

15:42.142 --> 15:43.474
now I got to go to work.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.276
Stew, Deb, we'll do this
another time?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.146
Yes, looking forward
to it, Toby.
Can't wait for that... Toby.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.414
Chill. Chill. Chill.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.382
Plant some love.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.951
Mwah.
DEAN: Aw.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.152
STEWART:
Um...

15:54.154 --> 15:56.654
GAIL: The cutest.
Huh.

15:56.656 --> 15:57.822
(chuckles)

15:57.824 --> 15:59.824
So, h-how old is Toby?

15:59.826 --> 16:00.826
Twenty-three.

16:00.827 --> 16:01.926
He's 23.
Years old.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.628
STEWART: I did not...
I did not

16:03.630 --> 16:04.963
expect that.
Oh,

16:04.965 --> 16:06.164
pretty sure I mentioned it.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.499
No, you definitely did not.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.336
Regardless, it's a fun age.
Just want to freeze 'em.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.104
You know, he's a bit
of a handful,

16:13.106 --> 16:15.173
I have to say though.
But, you know,
Mmm.
Mmm.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.342
You never, ever give up
on your kids.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.177
No, in this house,
we never give up.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.513
No.
Because defeat is a
temporary condition.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.583
Mm, and giving up
is what makes it permanent.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.713
STEWART:
Huh.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.622
What did you just say, honey?

16:31.624 --> 16:33.291
Which?
DEBBIE:
I like that.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.125
Is that from something?

16:34.127 --> 16:35.159
I'm not... You know,

16:35.161 --> 16:36.694
I probably read it in a book.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.963
What book, babe?

16:38.965 --> 16:42.133
I'm not... I'm not sure.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.435
Excuse me. The oven.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.486
Dean, are you all right?

16:48.341 --> 16:51.175
Not anymore.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.343
GAIL:
Cheesecake.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.644
DEBBIE:
It looks great.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.780
Oh, wow. Beautiful.
Thank you. Yeah.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.884
(mutters)

16:59.886 --> 17:01.219
Gail.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.487
Oh, God, don't.
Don't, Dean. Don't.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.022
You're not really

17:04.024 --> 17:05.490
a book girl, are you?
Yes, I am.

17:05.492 --> 17:06.691
I'm a book girl.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.229
You said Toby was going to work?
What-what kind

17:11.231 --> 17:14.499
of, uh, work does he do?
He's explained it,
and I don't understand.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.034
So...

17:16.036 --> 17:20.071
Unusual way to arrange
your couches, Gail.

17:20.073 --> 17:23.041
All focused on a wall with

17:23.043 --> 17:24.675
one single painting on it.

17:24.677 --> 17:29.047
But that painting doesn't sit
flush against the wall, does it?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.250
It's always bothered me,

17:31.251 --> 17:32.884
but I let it go.

17:32.886 --> 17:36.754
I suppose for fear of...
what it meant.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.090
Dean, from here,
it-it looks flush.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.426
I-I think it's good. I think...
You're-you're standing

17:41.428 --> 17:43.861
at an awkward angle,
so it's not as...
Stewart,

17:43.863 --> 17:45.823
remove that painting
from the wall.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.434
I mean, you're up.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.568
DEBBIE:
Just do it.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.037
Mm.

17:53.039 --> 17:54.939
(clears his throat)

17:54.941 --> 17:57.275
(quietly):
Oh, God.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.111
It's on there
real solid.
Stew!

18:00.113 --> 18:02.013
This is hard enough as it is.

18:02.015 --> 18:03.815
The painting, please.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.755
(sighs)
DEAN:
There appears

18:10.757 --> 18:12.890
to be... some sort of bracket.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.225
STEWART:
In fairness,

18:14.227 --> 18:15.626
Dean, this could be anything.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.528
The kind of bracket
that one might use

18:17.530 --> 18:18.796
to mount... a television.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.731
Judging from the dust pattern,

18:20.733 --> 18:24.135
it might be as much
as 50 inches of plasma.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.804
Hey, Dean, this could have
been here before she moved in.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.046
Gail, this was here when you...
when you moved in, right?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.811
No.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.079
No, it wasn't.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.148
DEAN:
You didn't get that line

18:37.150 --> 18:39.650
from a book, did you?
You got it from a little show

18:39.652 --> 18:41.385
<i>Entertainment Weekly</i> called

18:41.387 --> 18:45.423
"one of the more competent legal
dramas in quite some time."

18:45.425 --> 18:46.624
Oh, she's seen<i> The Grinder.</i>

18:46.626 --> 18:48.259
We were so close.

18:48.261 --> 18:51.662
I have just one question: Why?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.664
It was my only chance.

18:53.666 --> 18:57.935
I had read in this interview
that-that you said,

18:57.937 --> 19:01.672
"No one can be a fan
and a friend."

19:01.674 --> 19:03.508
I'm so, so sorry.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.643
No, I'm sorry.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.513
I can't say that I enjoyed
grinding you like that.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.181
I deserved it.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.450
Yeah, are we sure
this can't still work?

19:12.452 --> 19:14.485
I feel like it may be good.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.687
No. Look at him.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.989
He'll never trust me again.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.493
Who's gonna tell Toby?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.129
That we're breaking up?

19:25.131 --> 19:27.965
I honestly don't think
he's gonna give a crap.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.867
Then you tell him.

19:31.471 --> 19:34.172
Hey, um, can I just...

19:34.174 --> 19:37.008
ask you for one more favor?

19:37.010 --> 19:39.977
You want to have sex with me
while we watch<i> The Grinder.</i>

19:39.979 --> 19:41.546
If it's not too much trouble.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.681
You guys, would you mind?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.850
No, I would prefer it.
Uh, no. We also
are gonna...

19:45.852 --> 19:47.318
STEWART:
Thank you for...

19:47.320 --> 19:50.021
a lovely night.
Go have sex.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.189
I got to...
Come on in the car.
Let's go.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.356
It's cold outside!

19:52.358 --> 19:53.524
Thank you.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.426
DEBBIE:
Bye.
All right.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.698
Oh. So we're doing this
at home now.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.634
Hey, come on.
Dean, I don't want
to get up on that.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.571
All right, okay.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.308
(grunts)

20:12.011 --> 20:14.512
(Stewart groans softly)

20:14.514 --> 20:17.481
Hmm? Nice, right?

20:17.483 --> 20:19.684
Yeah, this is amazing.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.219
Yeah.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.554
Look, Dean, I'm sorry things
didn't work out with Gail.

20:23.556 --> 20:27.024
I really wanted that... for you.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.993
Yeah, and it's
just so much harder

20:28.995 --> 20:30.428
when there are kids involved.

20:30.430 --> 20:34.599
Yeah, kids, or...
a fully-grown adult man.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.167
And I'm sorry
that I got involved

20:36.169 --> 20:37.602
in that whole Lizzie thing.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.638
I mean, I'm not a
better parent than you.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.242
At most, I'm
equally good.
Yeah.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.345
I'm just never gonna
have what you have.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.447
That's not true, Dean.
You will.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.617
You just need to start
a little slower.

20:52.619 --> 20:56.454
I don't know. It's not like
I have it all figured out.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.556
I mean, look at this
Ethan thing. I...

20:58.558 --> 21:01.092
I always thought
he was so much like me,

21:01.094 --> 21:03.961
and then... I see him
with this girl,

21:03.963 --> 21:06.731
and he's...

21:06.733 --> 21:09.900
He's more like me.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.603
As scary as that is.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.572
So are you asking
me to be a...
Talk to him.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.740
A third parent to...?

21:15.742 --> 21:16.941
BOTH:
To talk to him.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.276
And work my way towards...

21:18.278 --> 21:19.744
Well, let's see
where it goes organically.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.579
Oh, man, thank you.

21:21.581 --> 21:24.415
This is gonna be great.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.285
Ethan!
Dean! It's the middle
of the night.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.753
Ethan!
Okay. All right, hold on.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.188
I guess we're gonna
do it now then?
