00:04.241 --> 00:07.202
SNOW JOB

00:09.329 --> 00:12.207
- Here's your mail.
- Thanks.

00:12.374 --> 00:14.376
I'm afraid they're all bills.

00:14.543 --> 00:18.255
I'll give them to Bill
the moment he comes in.

00:18.422 --> 00:21.508
- That's pretty funny.
- Thank you.

00:25.011 --> 00:27.597
Hold on there, sport.

00:28.723 --> 00:32.685
As you can see,
I'm wearing the colours myself here.

00:33.769 --> 00:37.106
As a veteran postaI carrier, I'm shocked.

00:38.733 --> 00:43.112
Department policy
regarding uniform states and I quote,

00:43.279 --> 00:48.200
"Uniform should be buttoned up
to the second button from the collar. "

00:48.367 --> 00:53.998
- You're letting us down, son.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean any harm.

00:54.165 --> 00:58.377
It's all right. I was green once, too.
You'll make it.

01:00.629 --> 01:04.257
- Thank you. I'll try to do better.
- Carry on.

01:04.425 --> 01:07.845
- Here's your beer, Cliff.
- Cliff?

01:08.012 --> 01:12.015
Say, you're not, by any chance,
Cliff Clavin?

01:14.142 --> 01:16.603
Sure am. You heard of me?

01:16.770 --> 01:20.482
Your name is a symboI
around our branch office.

01:22.317 --> 01:24.736
Is that right?

01:24.903 --> 01:27.781
Well, just the other day I messed up

01:27.947 --> 01:32.243
and my supervisor told me
to get my head out of my Clavin.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:52.780 --> 02:54.824
- Damn.
- What's wrong?

02:56.033 --> 02:59.954
Ann Marie's teacher's
gonna have to hold her back.

03:00.955 --> 03:03.040
That's too bad, Carla.

03:03.207 --> 03:06.544
Don't worry.
It's just as bad to skip a grade.

03:06.711 --> 03:09.714
- You skipped a grade?
- I skipped four.

03:09.881 --> 03:13.175
High schooI, I think they called it.

03:16.596 --> 03:21.559
I hope being held back isn't going
to be traumatic for Ann Marie.

03:21.726 --> 03:28.065
She's been held back twice. In her class
picture, she looks like Snow White.

03:28.232 --> 03:30.693
Coach, set me up with another beer.

03:30.860 --> 03:33.737
Where's Normie?
I've got a great story.

03:33.903 --> 03:37.574
Ain't my job to keep tabs
on the walking beer keg.

03:37.741 --> 03:42.370
- Who cares about your stupid story?
- Thank you, Carla.

03:43.622 --> 03:47.083
If you serve that beer any slower,
it's going to be vinegar.

03:47.250 --> 03:51.963
I'm on the verge of a new record
for fewest glasses broken.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.257
How close are you?

03:54.424 --> 03:59.638
I have to make it to midnight
without breaking seven glasses.

04:01.806 --> 04:05.518
There must be four inches
of feathers down there.

04:05.685 --> 04:09.481
Six inches. You can't be too carefuI.

04:09.648 --> 04:12.859
I never thought I'd see
you work with a net.

04:13.026 --> 04:15.111
You never will.

04:15.278 --> 04:16.946
Hi, honey.

04:21.950 --> 04:25.454
So the cameI says,
"You get your own date. "

04:26.747 --> 04:29.166
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

04:30.292 --> 04:34.380
- What's shaking?
- Four cheeks and a couple of chins.

04:38.717 --> 04:42.930
- So what'll it be?
- A pitcher. How about you, George?

04:44.098 --> 04:46.475
Who's your funny friend here?

04:46.642 --> 04:50.354
- Sorry. Cliff Clavin, George Foley.
- Pleasure.

04:50.521 --> 04:54.900
- We met at unemployment.
- What line of work are you out of?

04:55.067 --> 04:58.946
Tree surgeon.
I quit cos I fainted at the sight of sap.

05:01.198 --> 05:04.243
I'm getting a little woozy right now.

05:06.537 --> 05:12.458
Very humorous. Norm, I heard a great
joke down by the sorting machine.

05:12.625 --> 05:16.921
George claims he can run
the table before I chalk my cue stick.

05:17.088 --> 05:23.094
- Put your money where your mouth is.
- I tried it but the bills got sodden.

05:23.261 --> 05:25.346
I like him. He's funny.

05:25.513 --> 05:30.184
The rest of us are laughing out of pity
at the man's ugliness.

05:31.060 --> 05:37.066
He looks like a gnarled creature you find
20 miles beneath the surface of the sea.

05:37.942 --> 05:42.071
Come to think of it, he didn't say
where he was from.

05:42.238 --> 05:44.615
You know what I hate about
working here?

05:44.782 --> 05:49.120
I know what I hate,
but it couldn't be the same thing.

05:49.287 --> 05:54.417
Coach, two vodka rocks.
We never get holidays off.

05:54.584 --> 05:58.587
It's George Washington's birthday.
We'll be stuck here.

05:58.753 --> 06:02.465
Sam won't.
This is when he goes on a ski trip.

06:02.632 --> 06:04.551
What ski trip?

06:04.718 --> 06:08.722
He and his baseball cronies
go to Vermont every year.

06:08.889 --> 06:12.350
They rent a chalet, ski
and melt a few snow bunnies.

06:12.517 --> 06:16.771
- They've been doing it for years.
- He won't do it this year.

06:18.106 --> 06:22.277
- Why not?
- Because he's involved with me now.

06:22.444 --> 06:26.781
I know, but I still believe
in the old Sam Malone.

06:26.948 --> 06:30.201
I say he's still got some hair on his butt.

06:36.124 --> 06:39.711
Perhaps, Carla,
your desperate observations

06:39.878 --> 06:43.839
reflect the relationships
between men and women

06:44.006 --> 06:46.425
in the demimonde you inhabit,

06:46.592 --> 06:51.722
but for those of us who no longer
scrape our knuckles on the ground,

06:51.889 --> 06:54.516
your views are incredibly primitive.

06:54.683 --> 06:56.727
Says you!

07:04.234 --> 07:06.236
Sam, what's the matter?

07:08.906 --> 07:12.368
I got a call
from my Aunt Alice this afternoon.

07:12.534 --> 07:15.746
Uncle Nathan died yesterday.

07:16.997 --> 07:19.750
I'm so sorry.

07:19.917 --> 07:25.923
- Was he sick long?
- No, Coach. He was hit by a bus.

07:26.090 --> 07:28.634
That's comforting.

07:28.801 --> 07:32.679
I'm sorry.
I'm going to have to leave right now.

07:32.845 --> 07:35.765
I gotta go to Vermont for the funeraI.

07:40.269 --> 07:45.525
- Did you say Vermont?
- My condolences in your time of sorrow.

07:45.691 --> 07:49.404
- Thank you, Carla.
- I was talking to Diane.

07:53.241 --> 07:55.660
- Where in Vermont?
- Stowe.

07:56.702 --> 08:00.248
Stowe. Isn't that a ski resort?

08:00.415 --> 08:03.084
I think there is one nearby there.

08:03.251 --> 08:08.256
I gotta leave now.
I'm going to be gone a couple of days.

08:08.423 --> 08:11.050
This whole thing, I don't know.

08:11.217 --> 08:15.388
Sam, you must have been
very close with your uncle.

08:15.555 --> 08:20.308
- Very close.
- I should be with you at a time like this.

08:20.475 --> 08:24.312
No. I think it would just be
too depressing for you.

08:24.479 --> 08:26.773
I'll stay at my aunt's house

08:26.940 --> 08:31.361
and she doesn't believe in
unmarried couples sleeping together.

08:31.528 --> 08:33.697
We don't have to sleep together.

08:33.864 --> 08:36.908
Why would you be coming, then?

08:40.912 --> 08:45.333
To support you
emotionally through this tragedy.

08:45.500 --> 08:49.713
You are so sweet,
but I just don't think it's a good idea.

08:56.553 --> 09:00.807
Sam says his Uncle Nathan in Vermont
just died.

09:00.974 --> 09:05.061
- He sure did.
- Do you believe that?

09:05.228 --> 09:10.441
They wouldn't make funeraI
arrangements if he wasn't dead.

09:11.525 --> 09:14.570
I think they've got a test for that.

09:14.737 --> 09:17.990
Coach,
why don't you tell Diane the truth?

09:18.157 --> 09:20.951
There is no Uncle Nathan.

09:21.118 --> 09:24.371
Sam's accepted it, so we all have to.

09:27.875 --> 09:32.421
That guy is good. He made me look like
a big dope out there.

09:32.588 --> 09:35.215
What did he do, turn the lights on?

09:35.382 --> 09:37.968
What's that supposed to mean?

09:38.135 --> 09:42.348
Nothing.
Let me tell you that story.

09:42.514 --> 09:44.850
We gotta get going.

09:45.017 --> 09:49.271
We're going to the Islanders game.
George has season tickets.

09:49.438 --> 09:53.984
Smack in the middle.
I hope you have a good time.

09:54.150 --> 09:55.360
Nice to meet you.

09:55.526 --> 09:58.780
Hope you catch a puck...
in your Clavin.

10:01.532 --> 10:04.452
OK, I'll call you in a couple of days.

10:05.828 --> 10:08.831
Please convey
my sympathy to your aunt.

10:08.998 --> 10:13.503
I will. Thank you. That's very sweet.
Bye-bye.

10:15.088 --> 10:19.300
How long were your aunt
and Uncle Nathan married?

10:19.467 --> 10:24.597
How long? 40, 50 years. I don't know.

10:24.764 --> 10:27.809
My, my, my. It must be very hard on her.

10:27.975 --> 10:31.896
Just imagine. OK. I'm off now.

10:32.063 --> 10:36.359
Do you know the secret
of a long-lasting relationship?

10:36.526 --> 10:41.155
No, I don't, Diane,
but I will think about it as I drive along.

10:41.322 --> 10:44.157
It's honesty, Sam.

10:44.324 --> 10:49.413
Once honesty leaves a relationship,
the relationship is over.

10:50.664 --> 10:57.629
If one of us were to lie to the other now,
it would be a crime of the souI.

10:57.796 --> 11:00.966
Our lives would be diminished
beyond redemption.

11:02.801 --> 11:06.888
This is not one
of the world's great goodbyes here.

11:07.055 --> 11:09.182
Of course. You'd better go.

11:09.349 --> 11:12.686
Be carefuI.
There'll be a lot of skiers on the road

11:12.853 --> 11:18.525
and you know how insensitive people
on their way to a ski weekend can be.

11:25.407 --> 11:29.077
You're hanging by your fingernails,
honey.

11:30.995 --> 11:33.414
He'll be back tonight.

11:34.874 --> 11:37.835
You don't believe her either, Coach?

11:39.879 --> 11:43.132
No. I've got feathers in my shoes.

11:45.801 --> 11:49.513
I don't know how a chicken
keeps a straight face.

11:57.879 --> 12:01.633
- Coach, I need a draught.
- One draught coming up.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.428
CarefuI. For the record, Coach.

12:04.594 --> 12:10.392
The record's in the bag. I've got less
than four hours and five glasses to go.

12:10.559 --> 12:13.770
- Don't get cocky.
- I can't lose.

12:13.937 --> 12:18.649
I've never broken five glasses
in four hours in my life. Watch this.

12:21.736 --> 12:27.742
- Coach, you swept out the feathers.
- Feathers are for chickens. Here.

12:28.868 --> 12:32.538
- You made your point.
- Made my point? Watch this.

12:37.918 --> 12:40.379
You're only two away now.

12:40.546 --> 12:44.091
Two away.
Do you know what I think of two away?

12:44.258 --> 12:47.011
- What?
- It scares the hell out of me.

12:48.471 --> 12:51.223
Do you want to give me another drink?

12:54.768 --> 12:58.230
So what's your problem,
droopy drawers?

12:59.732 --> 13:05.195
You've been moping around like a schooI
girI who broke up with her steady.

13:05.361 --> 13:10.825
Moping? I'm not moping. Just spending
a little quiet time by myself.

13:10.992 --> 13:15.246
That's what a man is.
Solitary, strong, independent.

13:15.413 --> 13:20.668
<i>Ever hear of the lone wolf, Carla?
The lone wolf, c'est moi.</i>

13:21.753 --> 13:27.550
A man needing no one. I touch no one
and no one touches me. I'm a rock.

13:27.717 --> 13:30.345
I'm an island.

13:32.597 --> 13:35.225
- Evening, everybody.
- Norm!

13:36.309 --> 13:40.021
- Beer, Normie?
- I don't know. I had one this week.

13:40.188 --> 13:42.523
What the heck. I'm young.

13:42.732 --> 13:46.819
- So who won the hockey game?
- Bruins. 8-7 in overtime.

13:46.986 --> 13:48.738
A reaI yawner.

13:50.031 --> 13:53.951
- So where's Rootie Kazootie?
- George?

13:54.117 --> 13:56.036
He turned out to be a jerk.

13:56.203 --> 14:01.083
He saw some friends at the game.
He sits with them and leaves me there.

14:01.250 --> 14:05.003
It happens.
Friend turns against friend.

14:06.755 --> 14:10.050
I guess so. Want to shoot some pooI?

14:10.217 --> 14:13.720
What? You want to shoot pooI with me?

14:13.887 --> 14:17.975
Norm has deigned
to ask me to shoot pooI with him.

14:18.141 --> 14:23.355
Do I have time to get down on my knees
and thank God you've selected me?

14:23.522 --> 14:27.567
OK, but hurry.
We shouldn't lose that table there.

14:27.734 --> 14:32.197
I hope I can be as delightfuI
a companion as you're used to.

14:32.364 --> 14:35.409
This is like sarcasm, right?

14:36.201 --> 14:38.620
You're a reaI tack, Norm.

14:41.038 --> 14:44.250
Cliffie, I understand how you feeI.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.670
You're not second best, paI.
You're aces.

14:49.255 --> 14:54.593
I'd be honoured if you would shoot
some pooI with me. Really.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.179
Well, all right, but...

14:57.346 --> 15:01.017
- Norm, where were you?
- Georgie, my man!

15:01.183 --> 15:04.437
- I looked all over for you.
- Go, Bruins!

15:09.191 --> 15:13.446
Let's get a burger.
I know where to get the best in town.

15:17.324 --> 15:20.745
On second thoughts,
I don't think I'll go.

15:20.911 --> 15:23.205
- Sure?
- I'm not hungry.

15:23.372 --> 15:26.208
Whatever you say.
I'll go alone.

15:26.375 --> 15:30.044
- The best burgers in town you say?
- Absolutely.

15:30.211 --> 15:33.339
- I'd love a good burger.
- Glad to hear it.

15:37.177 --> 15:40.889
- You were going to go with him.
- With that jerk?

15:41.055 --> 15:44.058
I was trying to get his hopes up there.

15:45.143 --> 15:48.605
What do you say
we go and shoot some stick?

15:48.772 --> 15:54.611
All right. But stick the pooI cues
up your nostrils and make like a walrus.

15:54.778 --> 16:00.617
Right. I got another twist on it. I can get
the fat ends in there now. Watch this.

16:03.912 --> 16:05.955
The fat ends, you say.

16:06.998 --> 16:10.210
We're out of olives.
Did Sam order any?

16:10.376 --> 16:12.754
Why don't you just ask him?

16:15.172 --> 16:18.008
Why, where's Sam?

16:19.760 --> 16:24.181
I thought that you said
Sam was coming tonight, Diane.

16:24.348 --> 16:30.521
He's probably just coming around
the corner, down the stairs now.

16:30.687 --> 16:36.318
I should hurry and greet him.
Open the door for my boss on his return.

16:36.485 --> 16:40.030
- Hello there, Sam.
- Hi, Carla.

16:44.576 --> 16:48.080
- Ski weekend, right?
- What?

16:48.247 --> 16:53.502
Come on. It was three miles away from
my aunt's house and it came to me.

16:53.669 --> 16:58.590
- Ski weekend, am I right?
- I'm confused. What ski weekend?

16:58.757 --> 17:00.842
Somebody probably told you

17:01.009 --> 17:04.428
I used to go skiing
with my buddies on this weekend.

17:05.805 --> 17:09.684
Now that you mention it,
Carla said something.

17:09.849 --> 17:12.478
- I knew it.
- Coach, two draughts.

17:13.980 --> 17:18.733
Because of that, you decide
I'm Iying about my Uncle Nathan.

17:18.901 --> 17:22.363
For a moment, I was a trifle suspicious.

17:22.530 --> 17:28.493
That is totally silly, honey.
That ski weekend is part of my past.

17:28.661 --> 17:33.666
What kind of guy with a swell chick
like yourself would fooI around?

17:33.833 --> 17:37.545
Even when I was on that weekend,
I didn't fooI around much.

17:37.712 --> 17:43.718
Even if I were, I wouldn't be doing
what you think and I'm not, so it's less.

17:44.719 --> 17:47.972
So you feeI OK now?

17:48.139 --> 17:51.850
- I was never not OK.
- You weren't? Great.

17:52.017 --> 17:56.146
What a silly misunderstanding this was.

17:57.230 --> 18:02.569
There was never a misunderstanding.
I knew the truth the whole time.

18:02.736 --> 18:06.031
That's great. Well, I'm off again.

18:08.074 --> 18:10.326
If you were going to lie,

18:10.493 --> 18:16.124
you would have come up with something
smarter than this funeraI thing.

18:19.169 --> 18:23.423
- What do you mean by that?
- I could check in a minute.

18:23.590 --> 18:25.884
I could call a locaI newspaper

18:26.051 --> 18:30.055
and ask them to check
on their death notices.

18:32.515 --> 18:37.936
Of course. Everybody knows that.
I got a funeraI waiting for me.

18:38.103 --> 18:40.105
Don't we all?

18:42.024 --> 18:46.069
Well, slats, you blew it again.
This time he's gone.

18:46.236 --> 18:48.655
He'll be back within the hour.

19:01.168 --> 19:03.212
Damn tropicaI drinks.

19:05.339 --> 19:09.676
- It's too bad about the record.
- We were pulling for you.

19:09.843 --> 19:16.350
I came so close. Don't worry about it.
I still got a personaI record I'm proud of.

19:16.517 --> 19:20.312
- What's that?
- 11 days without starting a fire.

19:33.908 --> 19:35.952
It's almost closing time.

19:36.118 --> 19:39.914
You said that Sam
would be back before closing time.

19:41.123 --> 19:44.377
Damn!

19:44.544 --> 19:48.381
Let's you and me stop playing games.

19:48.548 --> 19:54.428
- Alms for the dink.
- Poor deviI.

19:54.595 --> 19:57.598
Would you leave me alone, please?

19:57.765 --> 20:01.477
I was almost up there
this time before it hit me.

20:01.644 --> 20:06.315
You don't believe me. I know it.
I think that is really rotten.

20:08.067 --> 20:11.362
I've never seen you act this crazy.

20:11.529 --> 20:15.282
It's so late.
You'll miss your uncle's funeraI.

20:15.448 --> 20:20.203
How do you expect me to enjoy a funeraI
when you're making me nuts?

20:23.290 --> 20:26.167
What are you talking about?

20:26.334 --> 20:29.796
Every time I go,
you say some little thing.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.965
I've been there so often,

20:32.132 --> 20:36.511
they changed the sign
to "Welcome To Vermont, Sam".

20:36.678 --> 20:38.763
What are you accusing me of?

20:38.930 --> 20:44.311
I'm accusing you of accusing me
of being a liar. Calling the newspaper.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.646
You said that to get me crazy.

20:46.813 --> 20:50.900
You and I both know
you wouldn't make that call.

20:53.153 --> 20:55.196
Would you?

20:56.656 --> 21:00.326
You did it! You called them!
I can't believe it!

21:00.492 --> 21:05.998
Now you know there's no funeraI,
no Nathan Malone. What a stupid name.

21:10.461 --> 21:14.173
- I didn't call.
- You didn't?

21:16.091 --> 21:18.510
I look like an idiot.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.015
No argument there.

21:25.517 --> 21:30.564
- All right. I'd better tell you the truth.
- That'd be nice.

21:30.731 --> 21:33.650
Diane, I work for the government.

21:39.156 --> 21:45.037
- What are you talking about?
- I am on a top secret mission.

21:45.204 --> 21:49.415
- You are an idiot.
- That's just my cover.

21:51.334 --> 21:54.670
Come on.
You've been playing games with me.

21:54.837 --> 21:58.800
- Don't you think you deserve it?
- Deserve it?

21:58.966 --> 22:01.844
You're talking to me
like talking to a child.

22:02.011 --> 22:06.557
- You've been acting like one.
- Don't use that tone of voice.

22:06.724 --> 22:10.603
- What tone is that?
- That one right there! I hate it!

22:12.605 --> 22:16.317
OK. Fine. Here's a different tone.

22:16.484 --> 22:19.403
- You slime!
- What?

22:19.570 --> 22:24.909
- How dare you lie to me like that?
- I had to lie to you. You made me.

22:25.993 --> 22:29.038
What would you have said
if I said to you,

22:29.205 --> 22:33.918
"I want to go on a semi-harmless
ski weekend with my buddies. "

22:34.085 --> 22:36.461
That's it. I've had enough.

22:36.628 --> 22:42.425
I don't care what you do. I don't want
to look at your big, flabby face any more.

22:42.592 --> 22:46.513
FooI around with every women
in Vermont. I don't care.

22:46.680 --> 22:50.433
Is that a fact?
That's exactly what I'm going to do.

22:50.600 --> 22:55.689
I'm going to go and have every girI
in Vermont. Even the bowsers.

22:57.065 --> 23:01.319
Go. By all means, go.
Have all New England for all I care.

23:01.486 --> 23:07.075
- Maybe I'll just do that.
- Mull this over on your ride to paradise.

23:07.242 --> 23:13.039
There happens to be a certain box boy
at my market.

23:15.041 --> 23:20.880
A sinewy youth who always wants to
carry my bags, if you know what I mean.

23:21.923 --> 23:24.633
Perhaps I'll go over there tomorrow

23:24.800 --> 23:31.348
and not demur at his subtle,
yet oh-so-unequivocaI advances.

23:32.725 --> 23:37.438
You do that, Diane,
and I'll try reaI hard to give a damn.

23:44.445 --> 23:48.324
Holy mackereI.
I forgot to ask him about the olives.

23:48.490 --> 23:52.244
- He'll be back in ten minutes.
- I say five, Carla.

23:52.411 --> 23:54.413
Maybe even sooner.

23:56.206 --> 23:58.625
A box boy?

24:35.078 --> 24:36.079
English

24:37.305 --> 24:43.749
