00:01.420 --> 00:03.620
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:03.620 --> 00:04.880
I'll pursue you all day.
But I won't chase.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.290
Why does she have
half a mil in stock

00:06.290 --> 00:08.120
from a company
Laurel Castillo owns?

00:08.120 --> 00:09.750
That is
a question for Tegan.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.670
Cora: Now, do you want
to ask her yourself

00:11.670 --> 00:13.170
or should I send her
this recording?

00:13.170 --> 00:15.210
Get your shady ass
the hell out of my firm.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.670
I'm gonna help you
get what you want.

00:16.670 --> 00:18.620
We'll file
a wrongful death lawsuit.

00:18.620 --> 00:19.540
Paul?

00:19.540 --> 00:20.330
I did it.

00:20.330 --> 00:21.330
It's murder, Ma.

00:21.330 --> 00:23.170
He's not the one,
Michaela.

00:23.170 --> 00:25.580
You feel like
bitch-slapping the Castillos?

00:25.580 --> 00:26.670
We're gonna file
a restraining order

00:26.670 --> 00:28.080
against the whole family.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.580
And here I am,
considering disappearing

00:29.580 --> 00:31.250
because I'm afraid
for my life.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.420
Either you protect me
or they kill me.

00:33.420 --> 00:34.920
Asher.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.290
Robert:
How about ice skating?

00:39.290 --> 00:41.540
I tried ice skating once.

00:41.540 --> 00:43.420
Made me appreciate
the concrete.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.420
Do you consider mini-golf
a sport?

00:46.420 --> 00:48.830
Is golf-golf a sport?

00:48.830 --> 00:50.080
Golf is my religion.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.670
Ah.
I'm hanging up now.

00:51.670 --> 00:53.210
Hey, whoa --
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

00:53.210 --> 00:55.170
My hobbies mostly include
the arts,

00:55.170 --> 00:59.000
like old movies,
the opera...

00:59.000 --> 01:01.500
And you don't like
the arts either.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.670
Why does it matter?

01:02.670 --> 01:04.460
I'm trying to plan out
our sixth date, Annalise.

01:04.460 --> 01:07.120
Sixth?
We went on one, for ice cream.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.330
Yeah, over a month ago,

01:08.330 --> 01:10.000
and as much
as I thoroughly enjoyed

01:10.000 --> 01:12.790
dates two through five
being on the phone,

01:12.790 --> 01:14.830
now I'd like to meet
in person.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.330
Asher:
Come forth, young Gabriel.

01:25.330 --> 01:27.290
I challenge thee,
Spawn of Sam,

01:27.290 --> 01:28.790
to a battle
for me-lady's heart.

01:28.790 --> 01:31.170
The good lady Michaela
shall pick her prince!

01:31.170 --> 01:32.330
En garde! Ha ha!

01:32.330 --> 01:33.420
Michaela: Put that down
before you stab someone.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.250
But that's the point,
my fair one.

01:35.250 --> 01:37.460
I'm willing to battle Cheekbones
to the death.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.670
And if I don't want that?

01:38.670 --> 01:40.380
But of course
you want this.

01:40.380 --> 01:41.710
You get the cameras
working?

01:41.710 --> 01:44.170
Yep. If the Castillos try
to kidnap one of us again,

01:44.170 --> 01:45.420
we'll have it all
on tape.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.420
Just put a sock on the camera
next time you two bone.

01:47.420 --> 01:49.380
There's no boning
happening in my room,

01:49.380 --> 01:51.210
not with you or Gabriel

01:51.210 --> 01:52.960
because I am fabstinent
and focused

01:52.960 --> 01:54.080
until exams are over.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.000
I feel like
we've heard that before.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.170
Robert:
Are you scared of me?

01:58.170 --> 02:00.170
Should I be?
Well, I mean,

02:00.170 --> 02:02.750
my awesome does
tend to intimidate women.

02:02.750 --> 02:03.830
However --

02:03.830 --> 02:04.960
I knew this was coming.

02:04.960 --> 02:08.540
Like, this phone romance --
it's fun, sure,

02:08.540 --> 02:10.830
but you know I'm looking
for something real.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.920
And, uh, if -- if that's
not what you're looking for,

02:13.920 --> 02:16.580
I just need you
to let me know.

02:16.580 --> 02:18.460
Less heartbreak that way.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.960
You're gonna give yourself
a hernia.

02:20.960 --> 02:22.330
Or is that what you want?

02:22.330 --> 02:24.710
Me to have to spend more time
in the hospital with you?

02:24.710 --> 02:27.170
I wanna look good for when
you're finally ready for me.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.920
What makes you have hope
for this?

02:34.920 --> 02:36.120
"This"?

02:36.120 --> 02:37.380
As in us?

02:37.380 --> 02:38.500
No clue.

02:38.500 --> 02:40.290
But that's mainly because

02:40.290 --> 02:42.170
you won't go out
on a second date with me.

02:42.170 --> 02:44.120
You've had
two failed marriages,

02:44.120 --> 02:46.710
God knows how many relationships
before that...

02:46.710 --> 02:47.830
Is it my bad jokes?

02:47.830 --> 02:49.540
I mean,
aren't you tired?

02:49.540 --> 02:53.580
I know I am,
from work, teaching, life,

02:53.580 --> 02:56.500
and then add getting to know
someone on top of that?

02:56.500 --> 02:58.290
I think the point

02:58.290 --> 03:01.830
is for that someone to make
all of that hard stuff easier.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.330
And, yes,
there's gonna be...

03:03.330 --> 03:04.920
...annoying things
that go along with that,

03:04.920 --> 03:09.290
like in-laws.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.830
You still there?

03:10.830 --> 03:12.170
Stay on the line.

03:12.170 --> 03:13.790
What's wrong?
Quiet.

03:13.790 --> 03:15.380
Hang on.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.710
You need me to come
over there?

03:27.830 --> 03:29.120
Go away or I shoot!

03:29.120 --> 03:31.000
Woman: Oh, my God!
No, please don't!

03:31.000 --> 03:32.170
Who are you?

03:32.170 --> 03:33.380
Sara Gordon.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.830
I think
this is my Airbnb.

03:40.210 --> 03:41.420
Isn't this
the penthouse?

03:41.420 --> 03:42.830
Which one?
There's more than one?

03:42.830 --> 03:45.330
Yeah. Penthouse 1,
across the hallway.

03:45.330 --> 03:46.710
Oh.
Y-- Right.

03:46.710 --> 03:48.670
I'm so sorry.

03:48.670 --> 03:50.290
Ugh.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.710
Annalise,
what the hell is going on?

03:51.710 --> 03:53.000
Annalise: Yeah, I'm fine.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.750
It's just some idiot.

04:05.290 --> 04:07.330
Gabriel: Greetings, class.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.540
Today, we're gonna do things
the Maddox way.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.580
Professor Keating,

04:10.580 --> 04:12.170
why is this 2-L leading
our class?

04:12.170 --> 04:13.540
He's first chair
on this case.

04:13.540 --> 04:15.620
Why?
Because he brought me
the idea

04:15.620 --> 04:17.750
that is the future of
the criminal justice system.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.380
Sit your ass down
and learn.

04:19.380 --> 04:23.290
So, before I introduce our case,
I need a volunteer.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.000
Ms. Pratt, why don't you
come give me a hand?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.250
No thank you.
Didn't I just say
we're gonna change the world?

04:27.250 --> 04:28.250
Get up.

04:28.250 --> 04:29.330
Gabriel:
So, here's the situation --

04:29.330 --> 04:31.670
Michaela here has wronged me,

04:31.670 --> 04:33.670
to the point that I would like
her to be severely punished.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.040
Michaela: I don't know
how to say this,

04:37.040 --> 04:38.790
so I'm just gonna rip
the Band-Aid.

04:38.790 --> 04:40.040
I'm breaking up with you.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.000
What are you talking about?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.380
I just need to be alone
for a little.

04:42.380 --> 04:44.040
Is this because I told Annalise
about Solomon?

04:44.040 --> 04:45.670
No, it's because
of everything.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.750
D-D-Did you and Asher
get together?

04:47.750 --> 04:48.750
No.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.620
Then tell me.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.330
I'm about to graduate
and you're not,

04:52.330 --> 04:53.670
and I'll probably move,

04:53.670 --> 04:55.120
but first,
I need to finish strong

04:55.120 --> 04:57.750
so I can be ready
for whatever's next.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.670
And that can't include you.

05:02.210 --> 05:03.210
Michaela --

05:03.210 --> 05:04.830
No, there's no changing
my mind.

05:04.830 --> 05:07.830
So...we're done.

05:10.380 --> 05:11.380
Gabriel: Now, I know

05:11.380 --> 05:12.580
what you're asking
yourself --

05:12.580 --> 05:14.120
just what did Michaela do
to hurt me so bad?

05:14.120 --> 05:15.420
You're gonna let him
get away with this?

05:15.420 --> 05:16.420
I object.

05:16.420 --> 05:18.710
She shot
and killed my son.

05:18.710 --> 05:19.920
So, what are
my options here?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.170
I could take her to trial,

05:21.170 --> 05:22.170
could push
for the death penalty --

05:22.170 --> 05:23.830
Hire a hitman
and take her out?

05:23.830 --> 05:25.170
Legal options, please.

05:25.170 --> 05:26.670
If I want to forgive her
and move on?

05:26.670 --> 05:28.540
Is that really
the legal system's job?

05:28.540 --> 05:30.500
Shouldn't it be?
Victims' families want justice.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.830
That doesn't mean we have to
lock away the offender for life.

05:32.830 --> 05:35.000
There are other ways
to reconcile.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.670
It's been used
after the genocides

05:36.670 --> 05:38.420
in Rwanda and Guatemala.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.830
It's a legal process
where a defendant

05:39.830 --> 05:42.670
faces a victim's families
in a public forum.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.710
That, my friends,
is called...

05:46.620 --> 05:48.120
..."Restorative Justice."

05:48.120 --> 05:51.000
And it's perfect
for our current client.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.540
David: I told my last lawyer
the same thing.

05:52.540 --> 05:53.960
I just want
to plead guilty.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.670
You'll get 25 years.

05:56.670 --> 05:57.880
I deserve more.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.500
Why?
I mean, who does that help?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.750
Meanwhile,
a restorative justice hearing

06:01.750 --> 06:03.880
will help everyone
affected by this tragedy

06:03.880 --> 06:05.380
move on and heal.

06:05.380 --> 06:08.830
Gabriel: Our client is
high-school teacher David Golan.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.460
Kept a Trasker 98
hidden in his classroom

06:11.460 --> 06:14.500
at St. Bridget's due to his fear
of a high-school shooting.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.500
This guy illegally brought a gun
to a school.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.830
Why does he deserve
a more cushy trial

06:17.830 --> 06:19.120
than any
of our other clients?

06:19.120 --> 06:20.540
Because it was an accident.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.540
You see, David thought
that his student,

06:22.540 --> 06:25.330
Ryan Fitzgerald,
was going to attack his class.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.000
David: Ryan's dead.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.420
If he can't heal from this,
then I shouldn't either.

06:29.420 --> 06:30.580
What about
his grandparents?

06:30.580 --> 06:31.670
Your students?

06:31.670 --> 06:33.540
Do they get to heal?

06:33.540 --> 06:35.250
Hands up.
What's the first step

06:35.250 --> 06:37.290
of a restorative justice
hearing?

06:37.290 --> 06:38.330
Mr. Walsh.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.620
The defendant acknowledges
their wrong.

06:40.620 --> 06:42.790
I never even saw if Ryan
had a weapon on him.

06:42.790 --> 06:44.620
I just assumed.

06:44.620 --> 06:45.790
There's no excuse
for that.

06:45.790 --> 06:46.880
But there is.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.000
Parkland, Sandy Hook,

06:49.000 --> 06:50.330
wherever it happens next.

06:50.330 --> 06:52.920
It is scary as hell to be
a teacher in America today.

06:52.920 --> 06:55.170
It's scarier
to be a student.

06:57.290 --> 06:59.170
And I just made it worse
for mine.

06:59.170 --> 07:01.040
Step two?
Ms. Osborn?

07:01.040 --> 07:04.000
Share and understand the
negative effects of your crime.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.960
Do you want to help
the people you hurt?

07:05.960 --> 07:08.670
Because this hearing
will give Ryan's grandparents

07:08.670 --> 07:10.670
the chance to weigh in
on your sentence,

07:10.670 --> 07:12.170
and his friends
will get to say

07:12.170 --> 07:13.580
what they want to result
from this tragedy.

07:13.580 --> 07:14.830
This -- This is
what you're not getting.

07:14.830 --> 07:17.880
Ryan -- Ryan didn't have
any friends.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.960
He was alone. Right?

07:21.790 --> 07:24.420
And I bought
into that idea of him.

07:24.420 --> 07:25.960
Step three?

07:25.960 --> 07:26.880
Really?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.000
Nobody has an answer
for me?

07:28.000 --> 07:30.790
Agreement on terms
of reparations.

07:30.790 --> 07:33.210
David: I don't want a trial
or a hearing.

07:33.210 --> 07:35.170
The D.A.'s already agreed
to my sentence.

07:35.170 --> 07:37.580
But Ryan's grandparents were not
a part of that decision.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.290
If they want me to do more time,
I'll do more time.

07:39.290 --> 07:41.210
I don't think you deserve
25 years for an accident.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.460
I do.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.170
You're playing the victim,
David,

07:47.170 --> 07:49.580
because sitting in a jail
and sucking up tax dollars

07:49.580 --> 07:51.210
does absolutely nothing.

07:51.210 --> 07:52.960
But if you speak
about your pain,

07:52.960 --> 07:54.380
you can teach people.

07:54.380 --> 07:57.620
Take this tragedy
and make it mean something.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.580
Gabriel convinced David
to do the hearing.

08:02.580 --> 08:04.290
I got the D.A. on board.

08:04.290 --> 08:05.830
The last approval we need

08:05.830 --> 08:08.380
are from Ryan's grandparents,
Thomas and Donna.

08:08.380 --> 08:11.330
I'm going to their home
later today to convince them.

08:11.330 --> 08:12.580
We're going.

08:12.580 --> 08:13.750
I never said that.

08:13.750 --> 08:16.040
Now, how do we persuade
these grandparents

08:16.040 --> 08:17.710
that the hearing
is good for them?

08:17.710 --> 08:20.290
Well, my idea was to hit them
with the faith angle

08:20.290 --> 08:21.330
'cause they're
devout Catholics.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.750
And I think
that we can do better.

08:22.750 --> 08:23.830
Anyone?

08:23.830 --> 08:25.330
Let them know
that they would be doing

08:25.330 --> 08:26.540
their community a service.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.380
Like they haven't
sacrificed enough.

08:28.380 --> 08:31.120
Come on, this case can prove
that the justice system

08:31.120 --> 08:33.830
doesn't have to be
just about crime and punishment,

08:33.830 --> 08:35.040
but actual healing.

08:35.040 --> 08:37.460
We speak from the heart.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.540
When my dad
committed suicide,

08:39.540 --> 08:40.710
my family
never talked about it.

08:40.710 --> 08:43.460
The avoidance
tore us apart.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.790
I'll share my story.

08:45.790 --> 08:47.920
Mr. Millstone,
meet me at my office at 2:00.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.330
We'll leave from there.

08:49.330 --> 08:51.120
Class dismissed.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.830
I'm busy changing
the world.

09:00.830 --> 09:02.710
I don't have time to meet
a new client.

09:02.710 --> 09:03.960
Nate: Not even me?

09:06.830 --> 09:08.250
You set me straight about
what Nate's been going through

09:08.250 --> 09:09.460
since his father's death.

09:09.460 --> 09:11.580
I decided to put
my hurt feelings away

09:11.580 --> 09:13.170
and help him.
How?

09:13.170 --> 09:15.880
Following a wrongful death suit
against the state.

09:17.210 --> 09:18.620
You're naming
the Governor?

09:18.620 --> 09:20.750
She ordered the hit.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.080
You're standing
in a man's office

09:22.080 --> 09:23.460
who's dead
because of that woman.

09:23.460 --> 09:24.960
You want to be next?
How is this any different

09:24.960 --> 09:27.080
than filing a restraining order
against Xavier?

09:27.080 --> 09:31.000
She's gonna hit back,
Nate.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.500
Out things
that none of us want.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.170
You feel that pain?
Miller: No!

09:38.170 --> 09:39.750
Now do you feel that pain?

09:39.750 --> 09:41.500
You're not on board.
That's okay.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.420
But I didn't hire you --
I hired Tegan.

09:43.420 --> 09:45.000
And we're filing this
today.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.620
Okay, let's all chill,

09:47.620 --> 09:49.540
take a night
to sleep on this,

09:49.540 --> 09:51.790
make sure we're naming
the right people in the suit.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.710
Or if you want
to file at all.

09:53.710 --> 09:56.500
This will be filed,
with or without you.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.420
Annalise: We can't let them file
that suit --

10:00.420 --> 10:02.420
otherwise, we risk
everyone finding out

10:02.420 --> 10:04.120
that Miller was innocent.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.960
Told ya this would happen.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.120
Well,
it's not gonna happen,

10:08.120 --> 10:11.580
because you're going to
scare Tegan from filing.

10:11.580 --> 10:14.620
What about you
just asking her real nice?

10:14.620 --> 10:17.420
I need Bad Frank
for this.

10:17.420 --> 10:19.380
Is he ready?

10:19.380 --> 10:20.710
He's always ready.

10:23.580 --> 10:24.960
Frank?

10:26.580 --> 10:28.170
Scare her good.

10:36.420 --> 10:39.580
What secrets are you hiding?
Come on. Out with it.

10:39.580 --> 10:42.170
Better they come out now
than during the trial.

10:42.170 --> 10:43.420
You don't have to worry
about me.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.670
Words every lawyer
loves to hear.

10:45.670 --> 10:46.830
Are you getting
cold feet?

10:46.830 --> 10:48.580
You're avoiding
my question.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.210
I know the FBI was
investigating you last year.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.040
They brought me in
for questioning.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.170
Look, if I'm gonna take a shot
at the Governor --

10:57.080 --> 10:58.500
Hi.
Unh-unh.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.880
You're still fired.

10:59.880 --> 11:00.880
I called her.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.330
No, she's not helping
on this case.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.500
She was in the D.A.'s when
Miller put the hit on my pops.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.170
Again, I fired her.

11:06.170 --> 11:07.830
Because of me,
and here we are.

11:07.830 --> 11:11.000
Tegan...I'm sorry.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.120
More importantly,
I can help you win.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.000
Asher: A hearing like this
is about supporting you two

11:20.000 --> 11:21.500
in the grief process

11:21.500 --> 11:23.000
and making sure
that you have the chance

11:23.000 --> 11:24.330
to speak your mind

11:24.330 --> 11:26.040
before
Mr. Golan's sentencing.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.000
We wrote letters
to the judge, A.D.A.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.080
We told them we want that man
to get life in prison.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.670
Look --

11:34.670 --> 11:36.170
I don't know your pain,
and I never will,

11:36.170 --> 11:39.080
but...when my dad
died recently,

11:39.080 --> 11:43.500
uh, it --
it tore our family apart.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.750
Um...instead of talking
about it,

11:45.750 --> 11:49.040
we -- we blamed each other,
and it spread like cancer,

11:49.040 --> 11:51.290
to the point where
we still don't talk.

11:51.290 --> 11:54.250
Speaking your mind,
even if it's all...

11:54.250 --> 11:57.620
anger, grief,
and rage, eh --

11:57.620 --> 11:59.170
it can help.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.250
Maybe we do it.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.540
No.

12:04.540 --> 12:07.080
Then our only option
is to take this to trial.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.830
But he was about
to plead guilty.

12:08.830 --> 12:11.000
As his attorney,
I can't let him do that,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.170
not when there are witnesses
who are willing to testify

12:13.170 --> 12:16.000
that he thought he was acting
in self-defense.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.250
There will be a trial,
but it won't be David's.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.500
It'll be Ryan's,

12:21.500 --> 12:24.080
his entire life
raked over the coals in court --

12:24.080 --> 12:27.460
his arrests for fighting,
drug use,

12:27.460 --> 12:29.170
rumors that he hurt
his mother --

12:29.170 --> 12:30.330
Sue died
of a heart attack.

12:30.330 --> 12:32.670
I'm just telling you
how the system works.

12:34.460 --> 12:36.040
That's why we're bringing you
this option.

12:36.040 --> 12:39.750
It's not just to protect you,
but Ryan, too.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.830
Gabey better put on
some lipstick

12:51.830 --> 12:54.170
'cause this ass
deserves a kiss.

12:54.170 --> 12:56.540
Did you get Grammy and PopPop
to agree to do the hearing?

12:56.540 --> 12:57.710
Like you need to ask.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.580
I'm sure Annalise had nothing
to do with that.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.170
Then why did she make me
your co-chair?

13:01.170 --> 13:02.500
Huh? Careful.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.670
Your jelly's showing.

13:03.670 --> 13:05.830
Hey, Michaela, how bad
do you want this...

13:05.830 --> 13:07.000
fiyah right now?

13:07.000 --> 13:08.670
What is he talking about?

13:08.670 --> 13:10.380
Can you two leave me
out of your pissing contest

13:10.380 --> 13:11.710
so I can study?

13:11.710 --> 13:13.620
Yeah.

13:13.620 --> 13:15.170
Is your vag laced
with, like,

13:15.170 --> 13:16.920
magical fairy dust
or something?

13:16.920 --> 13:18.790
Surprised?

13:19.960 --> 13:21.290
What is he doing?

13:21.290 --> 13:22.670
I asked him
to entertain me.

13:22.670 --> 13:24.460
Oh.
I want to be entertained.

13:24.460 --> 13:25.460
You already have two dudes.

13:25.460 --> 13:26.580
Eyes off mine.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.120
J.J.:
It was almost time for lunch.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.920
Mr. G was finishing up
when Ryan came in.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.330
He wasn't supposed to be
at school that week.

13:42.330 --> 13:46.040
He had been suspended for
throwing a stapler at Mr. G.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.040
That kind of stuff happened
all the time with Ryan,

13:48.040 --> 13:49.620
but this time...

13:49.620 --> 13:51.380
he kept yelling
all of this stuff

13:51.380 --> 13:53.080
that didn't make
any sense.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.420
So, when he reached
into his bag,

13:55.420 --> 13:56.710
we all just thought

13:56.710 --> 13:58.670
this was it.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.670
That's when I saw Mr. G
holding a gun.

14:01.670 --> 14:05.000
Ryan made jokes
all the time --

14:05.000 --> 14:07.580
about finding an old grenade
in his yard,

14:07.580 --> 14:11.170
or that he was learning
to make a bomb.

14:11.170 --> 14:13.620
He was a bully,

14:13.620 --> 14:15.540
but not just to me,

14:15.540 --> 14:17.210
but teachers, too.

14:17.210 --> 14:19.080
Mr. G got the brunt of it
for some reason.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.380
Ms. Maloney:
David's my friend.

14:20.380 --> 14:23.000
W-We've worked together
20 years.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.080
He cares about students.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.500
Some people got
under their desks

14:26.500 --> 14:28.540
when Ryan was yelling,
but I didn't,

14:28.540 --> 14:30.420
so I saw when he reached
into his bag.

14:30.420 --> 14:32.290
Everyone thought for sure
it was a gun.

14:32.290 --> 14:35.000
It was his phone.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.620
We all found that out
later.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.500
Look, Mr. G didn't mean
to kill him.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.210
It was a bad decision
to bring the gun,

14:40.210 --> 14:42.540
but I really just think
he was just thinking

14:42.540 --> 14:43.830
that it would protect us.

14:43.830 --> 14:46.290
It was a terrible accident.

14:53.790 --> 14:55.330
I'm so sorry, David.

14:57.210 --> 14:59.290
I have to tell them.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.250
I think Ms. Maloney
might need a recess.

15:02.250 --> 15:05.750
No. Emotion is the point
of the process.

15:05.750 --> 15:10.790
The thing Ryan was going
to show everyone on his phone

15:10.790 --> 15:16.290
was David's profile
for a dating app

15:16.290 --> 15:18.540
just for men.

15:18.540 --> 15:20.960
We work
at a Catholic high school.

15:20.960 --> 15:25.000
David would have lost his job,
and Ryan knew that.

15:25.000 --> 15:31.330
So, part of me wonders
if that's why David shot him,

15:31.330 --> 15:33.250
so no one would find out.

15:38.790 --> 15:40.330
Were you sleeping
with that boy?

15:40.330 --> 15:41.330
God, no.

15:41.330 --> 15:42.830
But he knew
you were gay?

15:42.830 --> 15:44.040
Yes.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.000
That's not why I shot him.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.580
How are we supposed
to believe that?

15:48.580 --> 15:51.040
I had Ryan in my detention
one day,

15:51.040 --> 15:55.620
and I...
I just left my phone out...

15:55.620 --> 15:57.330
and he saw a message
come through.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.420
I don't think
that's why I did it.

16:05.330 --> 16:06.670
But who knows?

16:06.670 --> 16:08.500
Maybe there's
just some part of me that...

16:14.120 --> 16:16.420
Maybe I did it on purpose.

16:20.790 --> 16:23.710
Promise me you won't do
something stupid tonight?

16:25.830 --> 16:28.170
I won't.
Good.

16:28.170 --> 16:30.540
Because the D.A.'s talking
about taking this to trial,

16:30.540 --> 16:32.000
but we're going to keep
this hearing going.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.120
No, Ryan's grandparents are
gonna want to take it to trial.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.460
That's for me
to figure out.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.620
Your job?

16:37.620 --> 16:39.500
Is to sleep.

16:47.830 --> 16:49.460
Get him on suicide watch.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.380
You got it.

16:58.380 --> 17:00.000
Did David set off
your gaydar?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.040
'Cause he definitely
didn't mine.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.080
Connor: I knew the minute
I saw his photo.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.080
You think everyone's gay.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.080
Gay for me, sure.

17:04.080 --> 17:05.170
I've missed
that arrogance.

17:05.170 --> 17:07.460
Oh, he's speaking
from experience, Oliver.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.830
There's the, uh,
the straight soccer player,

17:09.830 --> 17:10.880
straight banker --

17:10.880 --> 17:14.000
Oh, and don't forget
about Andy Dresher.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.120
Partner
at the law firm

17:15.120 --> 17:16.880
Connor interned at
before Middleton.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.210
Did you know that he had
a wife and kids?

17:18.210 --> 17:19.670
Of course.
And you didn't feel bad?

17:19.670 --> 17:20.960
He should feel bad,
not me.

17:20.960 --> 17:21.960
Should we tell his wife?

17:21.960 --> 17:23.080
-Are you insane?
-And ruin his life?

17:23.080 --> 17:24.710
Would you say the closet
is a very bad thing?

17:24.710 --> 17:26.000
It made David shoot
his student.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.290
That's not
why he shot him.

17:27.290 --> 17:28.120
Then why does
he feel guilty?

17:28.120 --> 17:29.500
Because he killed someone.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.080
Okay, but he feels
more guilty

17:31.080 --> 17:32.120
than most people would
in his shoes.

17:32.120 --> 17:33.120
You don't know that.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.460
He feels more guilty
than us.

17:35.540 --> 17:36.620
And we're not in jail.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.790
We're just sitting here,
eating cookies.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.620
Can we not talk
about this?

17:40.620 --> 17:42.580
I think seeing my mom

17:42.580 --> 17:45.170
brought everything back
from everything we've done.

17:45.170 --> 17:46.330
-Stop.
-Don't do this.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.330
Look, the whole point
of restorative justice

17:47.330 --> 17:48.500
is to talk and heal,

17:48.500 --> 17:49.540
and we never talk
about any of it.

17:49.540 --> 17:50.830
Asher...

17:50.830 --> 17:51.960
I just --
I still don't even know

17:51.960 --> 17:53.670
what you all did exactly
to Sam.

17:53.670 --> 17:56.540
Okay, that's it.
I'm gonna go upstairs to study.

17:57.670 --> 17:58.830
Gabriel: Michaela.

17:58.830 --> 18:01.000
It's Gabriel.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.290
I know you said to stay away,
but I...

18:05.500 --> 18:07.670
Today was hard.

18:09.420 --> 18:13.210
And I don't have anybody
to talk to about it.

18:13.210 --> 18:14.500
And I can't call my mom

18:14.500 --> 18:16.920
because she'll just yell at me
for staying here.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.620
And you know what?
I don't...

18:18.620 --> 18:20.420
Maybe she's right.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.290
I only stayed here because
Annalise is ballsy enough

18:22.290 --> 18:23.670
to do hearings like this,

18:23.670 --> 18:27.170
but now I just feel like David
might just get more time

18:27.170 --> 18:29.670
because --
And how is that
your fault?

18:31.500 --> 18:34.170
Stop making it
about you.

18:39.210 --> 18:41.080
See?

18:41.080 --> 18:43.380
This is why I need you.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.210
Connor: This
is stage-5 clinger territory.

18:45.210 --> 18:46.170
Asher: Quiet.

18:46.170 --> 18:48.750
She's gonna
break his heart again.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.790
Yeah, that's my girl.

18:50.790 --> 18:54.380
Gabriel, I've been very clear
about what I want.

18:54.380 --> 18:55.580
Yeah, I-I know,

18:55.580 --> 18:58.500
but isn't that just because
you're pissed at me?

18:58.500 --> 19:00.710

20:56.000 --> 20:57.920
saw we were about

21:17.290 --> 21:20.420
Don't.

21:20.420 --> 21:21.830
They could kill her,
Annalise.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.500

21:45.960 --> 21:48.790
Laurel?

No.

did you tell me?

21:57.210 --> 21:58.420
'Cause I want your approval

21:58.420 --> 22:00.170
Well, you don't have it,
and you never will.

22:00.170 --> 22:01.210
Why?

22:01.210 --> 22:03.290
Because you're
gonna hurt her, Frank.

22:52.710 --> 22:56.080
Yes, uh, to the 18th date
or whatever.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.620

23:02.040 --> 23:04.830
Okay.

23:06.710 --> 23:08.000
Oh.

23:10.580 --> 23:12.710
Tegan: I hate myself
for doing this,

23:12.710 --> 23:14.170
especially to you,
Nate.

23:14.170 --> 23:15.790
The last thing I want is
to cause you more hurt.

23:15.790 --> 23:18.040
Annalise get to you?

23:18.040 --> 23:20.170
Is that
why you're bailing?

23:20.170 --> 23:22.040
The Castillos
got to me.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.040
There's no winning
with these people.

23:26.040 --> 23:28.290
There's just more death.

23:28.290 --> 23:29.920
And God forbid I'm gonna
let them do to Cora

23:29.920 --> 23:32.170
what they did
to your father.

23:32.170 --> 23:34.120
I'm sorry.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.620
I understand.

23:40.670 --> 23:43.500
We get why finding out
David's gay,

23:43.500 --> 23:45.750
that Ryan knew,
complicates this case.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.330
Yes, it does.

23:47.330 --> 23:51.620
But if we go to trial,
you both won't have been heard,

23:51.620 --> 23:53.460
and you won't have heard
from David.

23:53.460 --> 23:56.290
This is your chance for him
to explain the why --

23:56.290 --> 23:58.750
why he acted
so irresponsibly,

23:58.750 --> 24:01.710
why he regrets it
with every ounce of his being.

24:01.710 --> 24:05.000
Speaking the truth out loud
has so much power in it.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.670
You, young man,
have no clue

24:07.670 --> 24:10.500
what it feels like
to lose a child.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.830
First my daughter
to a heart attack.

24:12.830 --> 24:15.080
Now this?

24:15.080 --> 24:21.540
Ryan...was the only piece of her
I had left.

24:21.540 --> 24:23.210
I understand.

24:24.670 --> 24:28.790
I lost my baby boy
to a hit and run.

24:28.790 --> 24:30.960
And every day, I think
about finding that driver

24:30.960 --> 24:34.620
and doing unspeakable things
to him.

24:34.620 --> 24:35.750
But more than that,

24:35.750 --> 24:40.120
I just want to hear him say
he's sorry.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.790
David's going to prison.

24:41.790 --> 24:45.120
That's not
ever gonna change.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.330
But this is your chance
to get your apology.

24:56.920 --> 24:59.000
The baby you lost...

24:59.000 --> 25:00.670
it was with Sam?

25:03.000 --> 25:05.830
Surprised your mother
didn't tell you.

25:05.830 --> 25:07.500
She knew?

25:09.000 --> 25:11.830
Is that when things started
going wrong for you two?

25:11.830 --> 25:13.290
It's like what
they say --

25:13.290 --> 25:15.210
nothing's harder on a marriage
than losing a child.

25:15.210 --> 25:18.420
Those grandparents
are still together.

25:20.710 --> 25:22.540
I get now why you begged
to make this

25:22.540 --> 25:25.420
a restorative justice case.

25:25.420 --> 25:27.790
It's not about
changing the system.

25:27.790 --> 25:31.500
You want for David
what you want for yourself --

25:31.500 --> 25:35.000
to confess your guilt
about killing your mother's ex.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.420
You're wrong.

25:43.420 --> 25:45.580
Okay.

25:52.420 --> 25:55.290
When we lost
our daughter, Sue,

25:55.290 --> 25:57.710
Ryan became our son.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.080
And now he's gone, too.

26:02.080 --> 26:07.670
That's why it felt good
to hate David,

26:07.670 --> 26:13.540
just to have some other feeling
besides...loss.

26:15.170 --> 26:17.460
And I hate this man.

26:17.460 --> 26:19.540
I do.

26:19.540 --> 26:21.580
But the Bible says

26:21.580 --> 26:24.540
that we should forgive
our trespassers,

26:24.540 --> 26:28.120
the sinner who repents.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.040
I want to forgive you.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.920
I really do.

26:34.170 --> 26:36.330
I don't feel the same.

26:38.420 --> 26:44.380
I forgave God for taking
my daughter from this world.

26:44.380 --> 26:46.170
But this?

26:46.170 --> 26:49.620
Did you do this
because you're homosexual?

26:49.620 --> 26:52.000
Did you think
Ryan was, too?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.170
Did you try to --

26:53.170 --> 26:55.000
No, I would never!
I-I swear on the Bible!

26:55.000 --> 26:57.210
Please don't speak,
Mr. Golan.

26:57.210 --> 27:01.250
I've had to sit here
and listen to these kids

27:01.250 --> 27:05.500
tell those lies
about my Ryan,

27:05.500 --> 27:08.710
blaming him.

27:08.710 --> 27:12.380
But let's be clear here --

27:12.380 --> 27:14.380
you are the adult!

27:14.380 --> 27:17.250
You're the one
that took the gun to school!

27:19.670 --> 27:26.290
If Ryan...was
so troubled,

27:26.290 --> 27:31.170
it was your job
to help that child.

27:31.170 --> 27:36.080
Instead, you made it up
in your mind

27:36.080 --> 27:38.620
that he was gonna
hurt somebody.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.080
I'm suffering, Mr. Golan.

27:45.290 --> 27:48.000
I'll die suffering.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.420
But it's you
who should be suffering.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.420
In jail.

27:53.420 --> 27:55.000
For life.

27:57.330 --> 28:04.170
That might make me suffer
a little bit less.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
You still think
this was a good idea?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.670
Why wouldn't I?

28:27.210 --> 28:28.880
I know more
than you'll ever understand

28:28.880 --> 28:31.330
the self-hatred
of being in this closet.

28:35.170 --> 28:37.500
Expressing grief
is a part of this process.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.710
Now it's time for you
to express yours.

28:39.710 --> 28:40.960
There are no words
I can say

28:40.960 --> 28:42.920
that's gonna make anyone
feel better.

28:44.620 --> 28:47.540
Let that be the last lie
you tell today.

28:50.210 --> 28:51.790
David:
I would, uh, much prefer

28:51.790 --> 28:53.380
to go to jail
for the rest of my life

28:53.380 --> 28:58.170
than to explain
how we all got here today.

28:58.170 --> 29:02.000
Because I don't think
I deserve forgiveness.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.500
Ryan is the one
who deserves that.

29:07.330 --> 29:09.830
The thing
that I'm afraid to say,

29:09.830 --> 29:11.170
because that's
how much shame there is,

29:11.170 --> 29:14.880
is, um, when Ryan came
into the class that day...

29:16.170 --> 29:18.790
...I had hate in my heart
for him.

29:18.790 --> 29:21.290
Not because he was trouble
in class,

29:21.290 --> 29:25.120
but hate because
of what he knew about me.

29:25.960 --> 29:28.620
The thing that I've...

29:28.620 --> 29:31.420
most hated about myself...

29:31.420 --> 29:34.040
that I'm...

29:34.040 --> 29:36.330
And what -- what character
is lacking in me

29:36.330 --> 29:37.710
that I didn't have the courage
to stand up

29:37.710 --> 29:42.830
to a 16-year-old boy and say,
"Yes, I'm gay"?

29:42.830 --> 29:45.790
Instead,
I let hate take over,

29:45.790 --> 29:47.960
and I, um...

29:52.210 --> 29:53.460
I'm -- I'm not sure
if it's the reason

29:53.460 --> 29:54.670
that I pulled the trigger,

29:54.670 --> 29:58.290
but I'm sure
that it was a part of it.

29:58.290 --> 30:00.170
Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald...

30:03.250 --> 30:05.210
...I am so sorry
for taking away

30:05.210 --> 30:07.420
the most important part
of your life.

30:07.420 --> 30:09.830
So, give me
a-a-any punishment you want.

30:09.830 --> 30:10.880
I want that, too.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.460
I want to take
your suffering...

30:13.460 --> 30:14.670
and I want to make it my own.

30:14.670 --> 30:17.830
That is --
That is my only wish here today.

30:30.210 --> 30:32.540
Gabriel?

30:32.540 --> 30:33.670
Hey.

30:33.670 --> 30:35.000
You were right.

30:36.540 --> 30:38.580
Why we broke up.

30:41.620 --> 30:44.960
I cheated on you
with Asher.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.000
What?

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
A month ago.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.580
Just once.

30:51.670 --> 30:53.420
I'm sorry I lied.

30:53.420 --> 30:54.710
I'm sorry.

30:54.710 --> 30:55.960
Asher: Hey.

30:57.670 --> 30:59.420
The judge
has his sentence.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.880
The purpose
of restorative justice

31:08.880 --> 31:13.120
is to help repair the harm
done to victims and families.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.080
To the degree that
this hearing has brought

31:15.080 --> 31:18.620
even a little solace
to the Fitzgeralds' loss,

31:18.620 --> 31:20.670
it's been time
well spent.

31:21.670 --> 31:27.330
But this court is also
about justice for the guilty.

31:27.330 --> 31:29.250
Therefore,
taking into consideration

31:29.250 --> 31:31.790
the recommendation
of the victim's guardians,

31:31.790 --> 31:35.540
we have come to the decision
to stick to the original terms

31:35.540 --> 31:37.250
of the plea deal --

31:37.250 --> 31:39.710
20 years
for third-degree homicide,

31:39.710 --> 31:43.880
plus five years for possession
of a weapon on school property.

31:45.210 --> 31:48.170
Defense,
do you accept this plea?

31:51.500 --> 31:54.580
We do, Your Honor.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.210
The plea is accepted.

31:56.210 --> 32:00.080
Mr. Golan will begin serving
his sentence immediately.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.170
Gabriel:
That's it?

32:04.170 --> 32:05.460
We go through all that

32:05.460 --> 32:06.880
and he still gets
the same 25 years?

32:06.880 --> 32:08.960
This hearing was a better use
of tax dollars

32:08.960 --> 32:11.960
than any damn trial
I ever argued.

32:11.960 --> 32:15.210
It's a damn miracle
that it even happened.

32:15.210 --> 32:17.170
Because of you.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Gabriel: Hey.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.380
Let's not do this here.

32:30.380 --> 32:33.330
Look, I don't care about
what happened between you two.

32:33.330 --> 32:35.880
You made a mistake.
Mistakes happen.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.620
Don't trip
over something so small.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.790
The fact that you're not
pissed about that

32:39.790 --> 32:41.380
actually means
that your feelings for her

32:41.380 --> 32:42.580
-are absolutely not real.
-Okay.

32:42.580 --> 32:43.750
You don't know anything
about me.

32:43.750 --> 32:45.170
I know she deserves better
than you.

32:45.170 --> 32:46.670
Oh, my God!

32:46.670 --> 32:48.420
-Aah!
-Just stop!

32:50.290 --> 32:51.380
Come on!

32:51.380 --> 32:52.830
You're gonna get arrested.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.500
Robert: Welcome.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.170
Can I take your jacket?

33:05.170 --> 33:06.960
Oh, yeah.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.500
I'm starting
to read my audience.

33:10.500 --> 33:16.250
I figured, uh, a nice, simple
dinner in would be enough.

is if you didn't do anything

33:45.210 --> 33:47.120
that needed
apologizing for.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.420
At least no one
got arrested.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.080

34:06.080 --> 34:07.500
That doesn't sound
healthy.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.580

are healthy.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.460

I mean...

34:32.830 --> 34:34.460

34:34.460 --> 34:38.330
I hoped it would lead

You know, we've had
some fun talks on the phone,

34:42.000 --> 34:45.670
but I really
don't know you,

34:45.670 --> 34:48.000
and you sure in the hell
don't know me.

34:48.000 --> 34:51.170
Both of my exes --

34:51.170 --> 34:57.250
they said some version of,
"It's not me, it's you."

34:57.250 --> 35:01.420
So, after a lot of therapy,

35:01.420 --> 35:05.540
I get told
that I don't feel worthy.

35:05.540 --> 35:07.290
I'm working on it.

what Xavier did to me.

he won't do that to you?

38:31.120 --> 38:32.790
