09:21.793 --> 09:25.068
We even did it
when we both had lice.

09:25.137 --> 09:28.379
- Yeah, you got me that cute
hat I had to burn later.

09:28.448 --> 09:32.103
Ah, but we can't go out
in this blizzard!

09:32.172 --> 09:33.896
- Yeah, better to stay home
and be safe

09:33.965 --> 09:35.586

ruin my chance

09:42.689 --> 09:44.034
to win Friendiversary.

- Don't mind us,
we're gathering more supplies.

09:46.965 --> 09:48.379
- Can we just make
this vision board already?

09:48.448 --> 09:50.103
- Not so fast, young one.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.000
You must first open your eyes
to the vision

09:52.068 --> 09:55.137
before putting your hands
to the board.

09:55.206 --> 09:57.034
Ooh, I need this!

09:57.103 --> 10:00.689
We've worked up a thirst
gathering supplies!

10:00.758 --> 10:03.068
- Dad, no!
Those are my tears!

a million times

you find lying around!

Well, I'm off.

- Where are you going?
There's a blizzard out there.

10:22.551 --> 10:23.724
- I'm gonna fight
through the snow

10:23.793 --> 10:25.206
and surprise Lex at her house.

that I've risked my life

my jar full of tears,

right in her beautiful face!

10:35.827 --> 10:37.344
- Dad's right.
You can't go out there.

10:37.413 --> 10:41.482
- No, I meant, what are you
thinking still standing there?

10:41.551 --> 10:44.137
Your idea's so good,
you got to get to Lex's fast!

10:44.206 --> 10:45.862
The colder you are
when you get there,

gonna work.

11:24.896 --> 11:26.344
- Okay, son.

11:26.413 --> 11:28.965
Let me see everything
you put on your vision board.

11:31.413 --> 11:34.482
No!
That's not a vision board!

11:34.551 --> 11:38.896
You need at least three collage
elements and a color pop!

11:38.965 --> 11:40.551
- This is a waste of time.

11:40.620 --> 11:42.586
Just because I put a picture
of Lex on a board

11:42.655 --> 11:43.827
doesn't mean the universe

11:43.896 --> 11:45.448

through the door.

12:06.068 --> 12:08.862
- Start over.
I didn't hear anything.

12:08.931 --> 12:10.137
- Okay.
[hair dryer whirring loudly]

12:10.206 --> 12:12.689
Lex decided she was gonna
fight through the snow--

12:12.758 --> 12:15.517
- Without the hair dryer on!

12:15.586 --> 12:17.241
- Lex said she was gonna
fight through the snow

12:17.310 --> 12:18.758
and surprise you at your house.

12:18.827 --> 12:20.758
She said that when you see
that she's risked her life,

12:20.827 --> 12:22.551
you're gonna cry for sure.

12:22.620 --> 12:24.689

she went to my house.

12:24.758 --> 12:27.034
How dare she do what I did?

12:27.103 --> 12:29.655

Hey, Lex.
I was just about to call you.

12:49.103 --> 12:50.551
So you're at my house?

12:50.620 --> 12:52.206
- Yeah, it's weird here.

12:52.275 --> 12:55.068
Your brother's gluing pictures
of me onto a board.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.586
Why are we riding a horse
on the moon?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.931
- You'll see.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.965
- So you're in my room?
- Yep.

13:07.034 --> 13:10.068

13:10.137 --> 13:11.793

So what are we gonna do now?

13:11.862 --> 13:14.620
- If I may interject,
you guys need to stay put.

13:14.689 --> 13:16.241
It's not safe to be out
in this blizzard!

13:16.310 --> 13:18.172
- He's right.
We should stay put.

13:18.241 --> 13:20.620
- Definitely, that's
the responsible thing to do.

13:20.689 --> 13:22.448
- You're coming here
to see me, aren't you?

13:22.517 --> 13:24.655
- Of course I am!

13:24.724 --> 13:26.586
And you're gonna do
the same thing, aren't you?

13:26.655 --> 13:29.034

This storm is serious,
and it's getting dark,

13:33.241 --> 13:35.068

are just gonna end up

13:35.137 --> 13:37.000

13:37.068 --> 13:38.620
We should meet
at the playground.

13:38.689 --> 13:41.137
- Yes!
- No!

like you're tougher

13:42.586 --> 13:44.448

the Friendiversary scarf.

13:52.724 --> 13:55.931
But don't forget the Munchy
Fun Pack for the runner-up.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.172
- What are you gonna do
while I'm gone?

13:57.241 --> 13:59.655
- Don't worry.
I've got big plans.

14:05.241 --> 14:06.827
Hey, Reggie.
Want to see something cool?

14:06.896 --> 14:08.965
Look, I'm one of those
inflatable dancing guys

Happy Friendiversary.
- Happy Friendiversary.

14:40.413 --> 14:44.172
I was hoping when I hugged you,
you'd feel warmer.

14:44.241 --> 14:48.137
- I'm trying to be warmer.
I really am.

14:48.206 --> 14:50.758
- Let's exchange our gifts
and get inside.

14:50.827 --> 14:52.206
- Okay.

14:52.275 --> 14:53.793
You just have to let go first.

14:53.862 --> 14:56.000
- Oh, am I still hugging you?

14:56.068 --> 14:57.965
I can't feel my arms.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.379
Open mine first.

15:07.275 --> 15:09.310
You're looking
at a year's worth of--

- Friendship tears?

15:12.137 --> 15:14.517
- Yeah.
How'd you know?

- Open my gift.

15:16.620 --> 15:19.517

is making it worse.
