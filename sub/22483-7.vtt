♪ ♪

00:08.000 --> 00:11.125
That is not a Band-Aid.
That is sushi.

00:11.208 --> 00:13.375
Sushi. (giggles) Okay.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.375
Hey, there she is!

00:15.458 --> 00:17.041
-Happy birthday.
-(Jen groans)

00:17.125 --> 00:18.542
You excited for the big day?

00:18.625 --> 00:20.125
Uh, not really. No.

00:20.208 --> 00:22.417
I'm 35,
so that is legitimately old.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.500
I mean, I'm older
than most mortgages.

00:24.583 --> 00:27.542
But I still have high interest,
and I'm not fixed yet.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.917
Oh. Yeah, the fact that
we're making mortgage jokes

00:30.000 --> 00:31.333
isn't helping me feel younger.

00:31.417 --> 00:32.542
But I know what will.

00:32.625 --> 00:34.000
-Huh?
-This.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.709
-Aw.
-It's one of my best yet.

00:35.792 --> 00:37.792
Picture of Clementine?

00:37.875 --> 00:39.917
Yeah. Happy birthday.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.250
Thank you. Yeah, I definitely
don't already have one.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.125
I got you Clementine as a nanny.

00:46.208 --> 00:47.458
'Cause I know

00:47.542 --> 00:50.166
how exhausting it is
being a working mother.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.583
So, I got you
a little extra help.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.166
-Clementine?
-Yeah.

00:54.250 --> 00:56.959
Well, really? Are you sure
she's-she's qualified?

00:57.041 --> 00:59.750
And also,
should we be hiring family?

00:59.834 --> 01:01.291
Is she even family at all?

01:01.375 --> 01:03.041
I mean,
I have so many questions,

01:03.125 --> 01:04.500
which are really
all fake questions

01:04.583 --> 01:06.417
masking my one actual question,

01:06.500 --> 01:10.542
which is: Why in the holy hell
would I ever hire a hot nanny?

01:10.625 --> 01:11.875
-What?
-Hmm?

01:11.959 --> 01:13.834
I mean, o-okay, yeah, sure,

01:13.917 --> 01:16.625
if you think about it, she's
okay-looking, I suppose, but...

01:16.709 --> 01:18.083
Come on.

01:18.166 --> 01:19.500
I mean, Tyler wouldn't have
married her

01:19.583 --> 01:21.291
if there wasn't
a whole lot more to her.

01:21.375 --> 01:22.709
When you first met her,

01:22.792 --> 01:25.959
you told Tyler he needed
to "lock that bod down."

01:26.041 --> 01:29.083
Because I knew
she'd be good with kids.

01:32.083 --> 01:34.875
Oh, honey, you sure you don't
want to go down the slide?

01:34.959 --> 01:36.500
I'm scared.

01:36.583 --> 01:40.166
Oh. Wait, no, you don't
have to be scared of the slide.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.333
Because it's actually a rainbow.

01:42.417 --> 01:45.125
Do you want to ride the
rainbow like a unicorn?

01:45.208 --> 01:47.083
Oh, yay, I want to be a unicorn.

01:47.166 --> 01:48.125
Yeah?

01:48.208 --> 01:50.041
Okay, go ride.

01:50.125 --> 01:52.792
Whoa. Riding the rainbow.

01:52.875 --> 01:54.417
-I love that.
-Yeah.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.750
It's street talk
for doing whippets

01:55.834 --> 01:57.250
with a belt tied
around your neck.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.625
But it's also good
for getting kids on slides.

01:59.709 --> 02:01.041
-Uh-huh, uh-huh. Sure.
-Yeah.

02:01.125 --> 02:02.667
-Lark, are you ready?
-JEN: Here we go.

02:02.750 --> 02:03.709
Come on. Come to us.

02:03.792 --> 02:06.208
JEN and CLEMENTINE:
Yay.

02:06.291 --> 02:07.500
Let's do it again.

02:07.583 --> 02:08.667
Yeah, sure, go again.

02:08.750 --> 02:09.834
(Clementine laughs)

02:09.917 --> 02:11.250
Oh.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.000
I have always loved kids.

02:13.083 --> 02:15.834
Nah, not me.
I had prepartum syndrome.

02:15.917 --> 02:17.500
That's where all babies
make you depressed

02:17.583 --> 02:18.667
until you have your own.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.375
I mean,
you can't be depressed now.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.959
You've got the most
adorable daughter,

02:22.041 --> 02:24.208
a great marriage,
and you're a freakin' lawyer?

02:24.291 --> 02:27.083
How did you do all that
by the time you're 35?

02:27.166 --> 02:29.083
Oh. (laughs) I don't know.

02:29.166 --> 02:31.834
Work hard, take chances,
keep it tight.

02:31.917 --> 02:34.875
No, you are so stylish you could
be on the cover of a magazine.

02:34.959 --> 02:36.834
-Oh, no, come on. (laughing)
-Yeah.

02:36.917 --> 02:39.709
I mean, maybe online,
but no. (laughing)

02:39.792 --> 02:43.375
-I love Clementine.
-Mm-hmm?

02:43.458 --> 02:44.834
Yeah.
Not as much as she loves me,

02:44.917 --> 02:47.041
which is why I love her.
And you.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.291
See? I told you
she was a good idea.

02:49.375 --> 02:51.083
-Yeah.
-Man, I can't wait to see

02:51.166 --> 02:52.875
who you're gonna get me
for my birthday.

02:52.959 --> 02:54.417
(whispers):
James Earl Jones.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.625
You know, turning 35
wasn't so bad after all.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.125
I was just being
so silly before.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.959
Like, I have so many things
to celebrate.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.291
You really do.
Hey, you know,

03:01.375 --> 03:03.041
we should bring Clementine
to your birthday dinner.

03:03.125 --> 03:04.959
That way,
when Lark has a meltdown,

03:05.041 --> 03:07.208
we don't have to argue
about who takes care of her.

03:07.291 --> 03:09.667
Well, it's my birthday,
so it would obviously be you.

03:09.750 --> 03:12.000
Then let's bring Clem.

03:12.083 --> 03:14.917
A grand celebration

03:15.000 --> 03:16.667
for a grand mom.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.583
-Aw.
-And that, Lark,

03:18.667 --> 03:20.542
is how you do a toast.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.709
Oh, no, I'm not drinking
'cause I've got the little one.

03:22.792 --> 03:24.083
Okay.

03:24.166 --> 03:26.333
I'm bored. I want to go home.

03:26.417 --> 03:27.458
Well, sorry, kiddo,
but I've sat through

03:27.542 --> 03:28.625
all your friends' birthdays,

03:28.709 --> 03:30.041
so you're gonna have
to sit through mine.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.875
-Are you done?
-Uh, yes.

03:31.959 --> 03:34.542
So this must be Grandma.

03:34.625 --> 03:36.375
I'm sorry, what?
What-what did you say?

03:36.458 --> 03:39.083
You must be the grandma
because she say she's the mom.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.625
No, I didn't.

03:40.709 --> 03:43.875
You think... you think that I
look like, uh, like her grandma?

03:44.792 --> 03:46.375
No, no, no, honey.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.959
I'm-I'm-I'm sure this is just
a little misunderstanding.

03:49.041 --> 03:50.500
No, because I ask you,
"Are you mom?"

03:50.583 --> 03:51.917
You say "yes,"
and push the plate.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.125
Oh, no, no, I thought you said,
"Are you done?"

03:54.208 --> 03:55.458
I hear your toast.

03:55.542 --> 03:56.792
You say a grand bottle

03:56.875 --> 03:59.333
for a grand mom,
and she plays with child,

03:59.417 --> 04:01.458
no drink champagne
for obvious breastfeeds.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.166
I'm sorry.

04:07.208 --> 04:08.625
Okay, y-you don't look...

04:08.709 --> 04:10.875
Please, please, please, please
do not get upset, all right?

04:10.959 --> 04:12.709
Let's just pretend that
didn't happen, all right?

04:12.792 --> 04:15.041
You are young.
You are beautiful.

04:15.125 --> 04:17.500
You-you look like Lark's sister
if-if anything, right?

04:17.583 --> 04:20.667
Her-her-her younger,
much more attractive sister.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.625
Okay? So just, uh...

04:22.709 --> 04:24.834
Okay. You know what, let's just
go back to having the meal.

04:24.917 --> 04:26.250
-Yup.
-Okay. Yeah.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.625
-Yeah.
-No, you're right.

04:27.709 --> 04:29.041
'Cause I don't want to make,

04:29.125 --> 04:30.667
-you know, make a scene or anything.
-Yeah.

04:30.750 --> 04:31.792
Yeah, big girls don't cry.

04:31.875 --> 04:33.166
-That's right.
-Yeah.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.291
Big girls don't cry.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.333
No.

04:35.417 --> 04:38.208
(crying):
But old ones do.

04:38.291 --> 04:39.667
No.

04:39.750 --> 04:40.709
Honey.

04:40.792 --> 04:41.750
No, no, no, no, no.

04:41.834 --> 04:45.166
(crying):
Oh, my God.

04:48.458 --> 04:49.834
Well, rocky start aside,

04:49.917 --> 04:51.917
I think this is
a pretty great birthday, huh?

04:52.000 --> 04:54.250
Uh-huh, getting through it.

04:54.333 --> 04:57.500
Oh, uh, you know what always
makes everything better? Cake!

04:57.583 --> 04:59.667
Yay! Cake!

04:59.750 --> 05:02.417
Dessert is on the house.
Happy birthday.

05:06.458 --> 05:08.041
All right, honey.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.375
Make a wish.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.000
Just leave me here to die.

05:11.083 --> 05:13.417
If you tell us, honey,
it won't come true.

05:13.500 --> 05:14.542
(sputters)

05:14.625 --> 05:16.542
Oh. (grunts)

05:16.625 --> 05:18.375
Uh-oh.

05:18.458 --> 05:20.875
Can I get a cake to go, please?

05:26.625 --> 05:28.041
Come on, Sophia, get it in gear.

05:28.125 --> 05:30.041
School starts in ten minutes,

05:30.125 --> 05:31.875
and that crossing guard
has been a moody bitch

05:31.959 --> 05:33.792
ever since she got hit
by that car.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.458
It's kind of weird that
you call our car "that car."

05:37.542 --> 05:39.417
-Morning, bro.
-Morning.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.959
Mom, can you make lattes?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.250
My friend slept over last night

05:43.333 --> 05:44.291
and is asking for one.

05:44.375 --> 05:45.417
I can't, honey.
We're running late.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.458
Also, we're out
of whipped cream.

05:46.542 --> 05:47.500
Don't ask why.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.125
Oh.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.834
ALEX:
Oh, hi.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.125
You must be Tyler's mom.

05:52.208 --> 05:53.875
You should be so proud
of your son.

05:53.959 --> 05:56.250
He is a very hard worker.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.125
Oh. (laughs)

05:58.208 --> 05:59.709
Sophia?

05:59.792 --> 06:01.834
Ms. Morandi?

06:01.917 --> 06:03.583
How do you two know each other?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.500
I'm Sophia's science teacher.

06:05.583 --> 06:06.750
Oh!

06:06.834 --> 06:08.291
Isn't that nice?

06:08.375 --> 06:11.750
You're experimenting
with both of my children.

06:11.834 --> 06:13.500
-What a coincidence. (laughs)
-Right?

06:13.583 --> 06:14.834
-(laughs)
-So cool.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.041
-So cool.
-So, so cool.

06:16.125 --> 06:17.542
Just, yeah, really...

06:17.625 --> 06:19.000
really cool.

06:19.083 --> 06:22.333
Well, I wasn't expecting
to see a student this morning.

06:22.375 --> 06:25.417
-Yeah. (laughs)
-So I'm just gonna go
back across the street

06:25.458 --> 06:27.583
-and look for my sweater, shoes
-Yeah.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.375
and whatever's left
of my dignity.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.667
-Oh.
-I think it's behind the couch.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.667
Your sweater.
Not your dignity.

06:35.667 --> 06:39.291
Wow. I mean, I'm flattered
that you have mother issues.

06:39.375 --> 06:40.667
What is going on?

06:40.750 --> 06:42.000
It's just a fling.

06:42.083 --> 06:43.458
It's not a big deal.

06:43.542 --> 06:44.875
I'm giving Alex a ride,

06:44.959 --> 06:46.917
so if you want,
I can drop off Sophia, too.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.125
I'll be ready in five.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.709
I just need to go
mentally prepare

06:49.792 --> 06:51.875
for the worst day of my life.

06:54.333 --> 06:57.792
I saw you getting out of the
same car as Ms. Morandi.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.583
Are you gonna marry her?

06:59.667 --> 07:03.458
Stay out of my business, Corbin.

07:03.542 --> 07:06.208
Okay, now it's time
to feed Skullcrusher.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.625
KIDS:
Yay!

07:07.709 --> 07:09.000
That's me. It's my turn.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.917
Actually, I think
it's Sophia's turn.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.250
But I'm at the top of the list.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.583
It was your turn yesterday.

07:15.667 --> 07:16.792
That was Sunday.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.333
It's not my fault
you didn't come in.

07:19.959 --> 07:21.250
Hey, Corbin.

07:21.333 --> 07:22.750
(whispers):
Remember this.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.250
(yelling)

07:26.333 --> 07:27.500
Mom said to sign it!

07:27.583 --> 07:29.083
No, I'm supposed to sign this

07:29.166 --> 07:31.125
after you finish
coloring in the squares.

07:31.208 --> 07:33.709
Sign it or I'm gonna bite you!

07:33.792 --> 07:35.500
Thank you.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.625
I've decided
I'm gonna bite you anyway,

07:39.709 --> 07:42.166
but I'm not gonna tell you when.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.917
TIM:
All right. Hey, gentlemen.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.375
There's an old man named
John in the other room

07:46.458 --> 07:48.291
who makes funny noises
when you poke him.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.166
Why don't you go
check it out, huh?

07:50.250 --> 07:51.458
Hey, if he doesn't
make any noises,

07:51.542 --> 07:53.417
you come get us quick.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.041
HEATHER:
Hi.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.375
-What you doing?
-Homework.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.500
-This was supposed to be a fling.
-Yeah, it is.

07:59.583 --> 08:00.792
Flings are supposed to be fun.

08:00.875 --> 08:02.375
What's fun about
having three kids?

08:02.458 --> 08:04.208
-Nothing.
-Exactly.

08:04.291 --> 08:07.458
This... You're in the middle of
a full-blown relationship, man.

08:07.542 --> 08:09.417
-You need to wake up and break up.
-Yep.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.959
I know. She... thinks there's
a lot more to this than I do.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.959
Or because your house
is on wheels,

08:15.041 --> 08:18.166
you could drive it around
the corner and hide from her.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.625
Where you going, Red?

08:21.709 --> 08:23.000
I've got a box of cupcakes

08:23.083 --> 08:24.667
here with your name on 'em.

08:24.750 --> 08:25.834
-Cupcakes?
-Yep.

08:25.917 --> 08:27.000
From Alex.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.083
She said she knows

08:28.166 --> 08:29.333
how much you love frosting,

08:29.417 --> 08:30.959
but she said it in a way

08:31.041 --> 08:33.083
that leaves me with
more questions than answers.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.625
Actually, Alex won't be
around here much longer.

08:35.709 --> 08:37.125
You sound like
you're gonna kill her.

08:37.208 --> 08:38.208
Worse.

08:38.291 --> 08:39.500
I'm gonna break up with her.

08:39.583 --> 08:40.583
What?

08:40.667 --> 08:43.500
But this is my first taste
of real power.

08:44.542 --> 08:45.542
Sorry, kiddo.

08:45.625 --> 08:46.583
I had my first taste

08:46.667 --> 08:48.000
of parenthood,
and now I understand

08:48.083 --> 08:50.083
why Mom drinks
and why Dad lost his hair.

08:50.166 --> 08:51.333
Don't break up with her.

08:51.417 --> 08:53.375
At least not until summer.

08:53.458 --> 08:55.500
I wish there was
something else I could do.

08:55.583 --> 08:57.542
-Ow!
-(growls)

08:57.625 --> 08:58.959
He bit me!

08:59.041 --> 09:01.125
-Who the heck is that?!
-(groans)

09:04.000 --> 09:05.333
Hi, Ms. Morandi.

09:05.417 --> 09:07.041
I'm ready to feed Skullcrusher.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.166
I love how we name
all of our hedgehogs after

09:09.250 --> 09:10.792
how the previous hedgehog died.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.041
I miss Bus Tire.

09:13.125 --> 09:14.166
Corbin.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.250
Looks like it's your turn today.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.083
Sophia didn't do it right.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.417
What did I do wrong?

09:20.500 --> 09:22.250
Sometimes we don't know
what we did wrong.

09:22.333 --> 09:24.375
Other people just reject us.

09:24.458 --> 09:27.000
Then try and roll their home
behind a bush.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.709
Well, just because
you and my brother split

09:28.792 --> 09:31.291
doesn't mean you have
to throw away what we have.

09:31.375 --> 09:34.083
You meant nothing to me, Sophia.
You were just a fling.

09:34.166 --> 09:35.959
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

09:38.625 --> 09:40.250
It's my turn now.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.667
This is not over.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.750
Mm. Ooh, $75 for flowers.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.000
Tim, did you buy me flowers
with my credit card?

09:48.083 --> 09:49.875
Yes.

09:49.959 --> 09:51.875
No.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.250
(knock on door)

09:53.333 --> 09:55.917
Oh, hello.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.041
Alex, what are you doing here?

09:58.125 --> 09:59.875
Thanking you for the flowers.

09:59.959 --> 10:00.917
Wait, flowers?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.959
And for the drawing
of a rainbow.

10:03.041 --> 10:05.208
And I circled "Y."

10:05.291 --> 10:07.041
I do want to kiss you.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.500
Okay, I think
there's been a little bit

10:08.583 --> 10:10.375
of a misunderstanding.

10:10.458 --> 10:12.208
SOPHIA:
Together at last.

10:12.291 --> 10:16.000
I can't wait to spend the entire
weekend with you, Pool Filter.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.667
Look at yourselves.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.250
Huh. Pretty nice family.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.875
Men I can count on.

10:29.959 --> 10:31.250
Thanks for the reminder, Dad.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.834
Yeah, you're all pathetic.

10:32.917 --> 10:34.208
Oh, okay.

10:34.291 --> 10:35.875
Well, the girls are
gone for the weekend,

10:35.959 --> 10:37.583
and you're just sitting here
staring at your phones.

10:37.667 --> 10:39.625
When was the last
time we did something

10:39.709 --> 10:41.834
that we could look back on
and say,

10:41.917 --> 10:44.083
"Hey, remember that thing
we did?"

10:44.166 --> 10:46.041
You mean like that thing
we did last weekend?

10:46.125 --> 10:48.125
Uh, I don't remember
last weekend.

10:48.208 --> 10:50.291
But today we're gonna do
something we won't forget.

10:50.375 --> 10:53.000
Anybody ever heard of
those escape rooms?

10:53.083 --> 10:55.458
Yeah, I've done
every single one in town.

10:55.542 --> 10:56.667
Me and my crew.

10:56.750 --> 10:57.959
Your crew?

10:58.041 --> 10:59.458
Yeah.

10:59.542 --> 11:01.375
It's just whoever
they pair me up with.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.083
Last time,
it was a bunch of women

11:03.166 --> 11:06.917
who met 'cause their sons
were lovers in college.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.375
Well, I guarantee

11:08.458 --> 11:10.041
you haven't been to this one

11:10.125 --> 11:11.875
because this one is here.

11:11.959 --> 11:13.083
(train whistle blowing)

11:13.166 --> 11:15.667
Ow.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.208
Gentlemen.

11:18.291 --> 11:19.583
Good evening.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.667
Colonel Richard York

11:21.750 --> 11:22.917
at your service.

11:23.000 --> 11:23.959
All aboard

11:24.041 --> 11:25.709
the Siberian Express,

11:25.792 --> 11:28.333
where a fantastical adventure
awaits you.

11:28.417 --> 11:30.250
Look at this. They've
been decorating all day.

11:30.333 --> 11:32.750
I-I don't even recognize
my own bedroom.

11:32.834 --> 11:33.875
And look at those
velvety drapes.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.083
I mean, this is like a train.

11:36.166 --> 11:37.500
Oh, hey. Good one, Dad.

11:37.583 --> 11:40.000
-A keen eye is an observant eye.
-Whoa.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.125
Hey, how'd you get that cane
to stand up like that?

11:42.208 --> 11:43.625
Oh, you just stabbed that
into the floor, huh?

11:43.709 --> 11:45.375
Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut.
The year...

11:45.458 --> 11:47.667
1933.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.125
But you wouldn't know that,

11:49.208 --> 11:52.583
for there are no clocks
in this room.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.709
-Well, how does a clock
tell you what year it is?
-(scoffs)

11:54.792 --> 11:57.542
Ah! Well done.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.125
You've discovered
the first clue.

11:59.208 --> 12:01.125
You should be
the lead investigator.

12:01.208 --> 12:03.667
Me? What-what do I get?
Like, a pipe or something?

12:03.750 --> 12:05.750
No, no, no, i-if there's
a pipe, I get it.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.750
I'm... I paid the
$600 for this.

12:07.834 --> 12:09.834
Hold on.
Shouldn't the lead investigator

12:09.917 --> 12:12.959
be someone who has escaped
from a World War II submarine

12:13.041 --> 12:15.166
and an Old West mine shaft?

12:15.250 --> 12:16.792
And a relative's house
during a party

12:16.875 --> 12:19.000
when I left something in
the bathroom I couldn't flush.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.208
That was you?

12:21.125 --> 12:22.375
Now...

12:22.458 --> 12:24.792
this room is filled with clues--

12:24.875 --> 12:26.917
clues you will need

12:27.000 --> 12:29.750
to escape from this
locked train cabin

12:29.834 --> 12:33.834
before the train veers
off the tracks in 60 minutes.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.125
Simply lock
this combination lock,

12:37.208 --> 12:39.417
and your time begins.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.458
That's another clue.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.834
It's not.

12:42.917 --> 12:45.750
-I got it.
-All right, let's tear this place apart.

12:49.083 --> 12:51.125
Dad, wasn't that your mirror?

12:51.208 --> 12:53.458
Oh.

12:53.542 --> 12:56.208
Ooh. Hey, you guys cool
if I solve this puzzle

12:56.291 --> 12:58.000
just by peeling off
all the stickers?

13:00.041 --> 13:02.041
(shudders)

13:02.125 --> 13:04.542
-I don't want to play anymore.
I don't want to play anymore.
-What? Why not?

13:04.625 --> 13:06.041
Because that's Mom and Dad's
underwear drawer,

13:06.125 --> 13:07.959
and it is not
of the everyday variety.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.583
That's not part of the game.

13:09.667 --> 13:10.667
I mean, it is part

13:10.750 --> 13:12.625
of <i>a </i>game, but not this game.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.083
(chuckles)

13:14.166 --> 13:16.500
You know what?

13:16.583 --> 13:18.458
We've overlooked the most
obvious clue in the room:

13:18.542 --> 13:19.583
the cane!

13:20.709 --> 13:22.709
-Ew. Why is it sticky?
-Ew.

13:23.834 --> 13:24.792
JOHN:
Come on.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.959
Quit horsing around
and look for clues.

13:27.041 --> 13:30.208
We looked. All we found were...
string underwear.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.000
For men.

13:32.083 --> 13:35.291
All I wanted was to have
some memories with my sons, huh?

13:35.375 --> 13:38.625
And Tim, because he happened to
be in the room when I came in.

13:38.709 --> 13:40.041
But forget it.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.208
Hey, uh, you can let us out.

13:42.291 --> 13:43.917
GREG:
What? Hey, Dad, did you, uh,

13:44.000 --> 13:45.750
send your bed out to be
reupholstered?

13:45.834 --> 13:47.542
No, they had to move it out
to make room

13:47.625 --> 13:49.542
for these tables full of clues.

13:49.625 --> 13:52.208
GREG:
Yeah, well, some guys are
putting it on the trucks now,

13:52.291 --> 13:54.083
along with all of
your other furniture.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.750
We're getting robbed.

13:56.834 --> 13:57.959
Where did you find this guy?

13:58.041 --> 14:00.709
I-In the parking lot of
another escape room place.

14:00.792 --> 14:02.083
H-He said he'd beat their price,

14:02.166 --> 14:04.417
and honestly,
he came real close.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.208
You promised Mom
that you were gonna stop

14:06.291 --> 14:08.083
talking to people
in parking lots.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.750
Hey, relax.
We'll just call the police.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.000
He took our phones.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.417
Okay, fine,
then we'll go out the window.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.625
Wait, no, hey, wait!
We're on the second floor.

14:14.709 --> 14:16.250
-How we gonna get down?
-Well, I don't know.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.709
We can tie together your
weird outfits from the drawer.

14:18.792 --> 14:19.834
Not a good idea.

14:19.917 --> 14:21.583
Th-They're meant to tear away.

14:21.667 --> 14:22.834
-Ugh.
-Oh, God.

14:22.917 --> 14:25.208
Hey, I think that's
the lock from my gun safe.

14:25.291 --> 14:27.291
-What?
-Damn it, he's-he's got my guns!

14:27.375 --> 14:28.917
What's the combination?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.291
Try, uh, seven.

14:30.375 --> 14:31.834
I need four digits.

14:31.917 --> 14:35.083
Try, uh, zero...
double-"O" seven.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.500
Like James Bond?

14:36.583 --> 14:38.250
No. Like the number seven.

14:38.333 --> 14:41.333
Ah! Missed it.
Got to go around the horn again.

14:42.208 --> 14:44.125
-Ah!
-(all cheer)

14:46.083 --> 14:48.250
-TIM: Let's get out.
-Wait. No.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.000
You go first, Tim.
You earned it.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.417
Thanks, guys.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.917
They got my guns.

14:55.083 --> 14:56.917
JOHN:
Well, cops are on their way.

14:57.041 --> 14:59.250
Wow.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.250
I mean, they took everything.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.333
That bastard York's gonna be
taking the Siberian Express

15:03.417 --> 15:04.667
into early retirement.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.333
More like an early grave.

15:06.417 --> 15:07.542
I got a look
at that guy's thyroid.

15:07.625 --> 15:09.000
It's pretty enlarged.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.417
If he doesn't get it
checked out soon,

15:10.500 --> 15:11.834
he's got weeks, tops.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.250
Why didn't you say
anything to him?

15:13.333 --> 15:14.458
He was a crook.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.250
We didn't know that at the time.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.959
Ooh.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.834
And he was like, "In you go."
Oh, I got it.

15:25.917 --> 15:28.083
-No, honey.
-No, Joan. I got it this time.

15:28.166 --> 15:30.750
Honey, let's not do this dance.
I'm getting this.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.041
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.583
Plus, it's just so much easier

15:33.667 --> 15:35.709
for me to pay with one card
than it is

15:35.792 --> 15:37.834
to try and watch you
spread it out over six.

15:37.917 --> 15:40.917
Thank you so much, Joan.
I got the next one.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.500
I bought a lotto ticket today,
and I am feeling lucky.

15:44.583 --> 15:47.875
You know, have you ever thought
about trying to use logic

15:47.959 --> 15:52.000
to guide your life
instead of the black arts?

15:52.083 --> 15:54.542
Well, I know it sounds crazy,
but my fortune cookie last night

15:54.625 --> 15:57.417
said that I'm coming into
some unexpected money.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.542
-So that's a no to logic?
-Right.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.750
-Go, go, go.
-TV ANNOUNCER: <i>Breaks free at the 30.</i>

16:01.834 --> 16:03.959
<i>-And here he goes.</i>
-Go. Go.

16:04.041 --> 16:07.625
Yes! Oh, that was beautiful! Oh.

16:07.709 --> 16:09.041
Hey, baby, how was lunch?

16:09.125 --> 16:11.250
Awful. I am so upset.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.875
Uh-oh.
Oh, boy, this seems like

16:12.959 --> 16:14.625
a turn-off-the-TV
kind of conversation.

16:14.709 --> 16:15.875
Yes, it is.

16:15.959 --> 16:17.375
Okay. Good.

16:17.458 --> 16:18.750
You know that lotto ticket
I bought?

16:18.834 --> 16:21.417
A valet stole it
from the car.

16:21.500 --> 16:25.000
Okay, well, maybe you
just misplaced it,

16:25.083 --> 16:27.333
because that is a thing
that tends to happen

16:27.417 --> 16:29.875
to you all the time, right?

16:29.959 --> 16:31.083
No, not right!

16:31.166 --> 16:33.333
It was in my cup holder.

16:33.417 --> 16:35.583
Okay, well, hey, hey, hey,
we already won the lottery.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.208
Right? We found each other.

16:37.291 --> 16:39.125
Come here. Mmm. Oh.
I love you so much.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.834
(TV clicks on)

16:40.917 --> 16:41.959
It's the principle, Matt.

16:42.041 --> 16:43.458
-Yes, it is. Of course it is.
-(TV clicks off)

16:43.542 --> 16:44.917
And you know what
I'm gonna do tomorrow?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.083
I'm gonna go back and I am gonna
call that little weasel out.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.709
-Okay.
-You're gonna be my backup.

16:48.792 --> 16:49.917
-Yeah.
-In case things get physical.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.834
-Sure.
-Which they will.

16:51.917 --> 16:53.917
Okay.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.125
(TV clicks on)

16:55.208 --> 16:56.542
And I'm gonna tell
you something else.

16:56.625 --> 16:58.291
-Yeah.
-(TV clicks off)

17:01.000 --> 17:02.291
She's 42.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.166
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, honey.

17:04.250 --> 17:06.083
Um, I need a favor from you.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.959
No. No more postage stamps.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.542
I have to draw the line.

17:10.625 --> 17:12.583
Well, that is
genuinely upsetting,

17:12.667 --> 17:14.417
but that's actually not
why I'm here.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.750
I bought this lottery ticket,
and I need you to tell Colleen

17:17.834 --> 17:20.083
that it fell out of her
purse at your lunch.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.959
-Honey, I'm not comfortable
lying to your wife.
-No, please, Mom.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.375
You know Colleen.
She's always losing things

17:24.458 --> 17:26.250
and then blaming other people
for stealing them, and then,

17:26.333 --> 17:27.417
like, a week later,
they turn up

17:27.500 --> 17:29.417
in one of her other pockets
or in our freezer.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.709
Ooh, that's good to know.

17:30.792 --> 17:32.250
I forgot to return
her earrings,

17:32.333 --> 17:34.250
and now I can just
stick them in your freezer.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.542
Yeah, absolutely.

17:35.625 --> 17:36.959
But I need your help.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.709
Do you know how many
restaurants in this town

17:38.792 --> 17:40.000
I'm no longer allowed in

17:40.083 --> 17:42.333
because Colleen has made
a scene in them?

17:42.417 --> 17:44.917
It's actually not that many,
but one of them's a Benihana.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.417
A Benihana, Mom.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.083
Colleen has
her eccentricities, honey,

17:48.166 --> 17:49.500
but I think you need

17:49.583 --> 17:51.333
to have your wife's back.

17:51.417 --> 17:53.959
-But I think she's wrong.
-Oh, then lie.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.125
I thought you said you weren't
comfortable lying to her.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.917
Well, she's not my wife.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.542
(heavy metal music playing)

18:00.625 --> 18:02.500
This valet is gonna pay!

18:02.583 --> 18:04.333
Hey, babe.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.417
Do you mind if I play deejay
for a minute?

18:06.500 --> 18:07.917
You know, I could throw on

18:08.000 --> 18:09.417
some, like,
smooth adult contemporary

18:09.500 --> 18:11.291
or that enormous shirtless man
who plays the ukulele

18:11.375 --> 18:12.625
that you like. Right?

18:12.709 --> 18:14.333
-Oh.
-(music stops)

18:14.417 --> 18:15.792
Sorry, I missed what you said.

18:15.875 --> 18:16.834
Yeah.

18:16.917 --> 18:18.166
-I am amped!
-(laughs)

18:18.250 --> 18:20.625
I think I should probably
be bad cop, don't you?

18:20.709 --> 18:22.041
-Or...
-Yeah?

18:22.125 --> 18:24.792
...we could do good cop,
better cop.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.709
Right? Nobody ever expects
to see that coming.

18:26.792 --> 18:28.333
You know, they'd be like,

18:28.417 --> 18:33.125
"What? Yeah, this guy's
even more pleasant? Uh..."

18:33.208 --> 18:35.000
That sounds boring.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.083
(heavy metal music playing)

18:45.291 --> 18:48.000
Carry yourself like
you've got a gun in your pocket.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.834
-What?
-Let's do this!

18:49.917 --> 18:51.500
It's about to get very...

18:51.583 --> 18:52.750
Hi!

18:52.834 --> 18:55.583
Thank you so much.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.291
Where's TJ?

18:59.333 --> 19:00.583
TJ quit?

19:00.667 --> 19:02.458
Yeah, yesterday.
He flipped off our boss

19:02.542 --> 19:04.125
and said he didn't need
this place anymore.

19:04.208 --> 19:06.125
I knew it.
TJ stole my ticket,

19:06.208 --> 19:08.291
he won the lottery,
and now he has my money.

19:08.375 --> 19:10.917
I am gonna Google his ass
and track him down.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.166
Where's my phone?
Somebody stole my phone.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.208
Okay, no, Colleen,
nobody stole your phone.

19:16.291 --> 19:17.542
And nobody stole
your lottery ticket.

19:17.625 --> 19:19.083
What are you saying?

19:19.166 --> 19:21.041
I'm saying that sometimes
it's nobody else's fault

19:21.125 --> 19:22.083
but your own, okay?

19:22.166 --> 19:23.250
There is a reason

19:23.333 --> 19:25.542
that you have
12 pairs of sunglasses,

19:25.625 --> 19:28.625
and it's not because, like,
some thief keeps returning them.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.458
Wow.

19:30.542 --> 19:32.291
I didn't know you felt that way.

19:32.375 --> 19:33.667
Ugh, Colleen.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.542
No. Leave me alone.
I'm calling a Lyft.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.000
I thought somebody stole
your phone.

19:38.083 --> 19:39.834
Well, I forgot
this dress had pockets.

19:39.917 --> 19:40.875
Ah.

19:40.959 --> 19:42.417
Dude, that's messed up.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.208
You should always have
your wife's back.

19:44.291 --> 19:47.208
Yeah. Also, TJ probably
did steal the ticket.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.375
He's kinda like a known thief.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.542
(sighs)

19:52.625 --> 19:54.750
What?

19:56.125 --> 19:57.583
I knew it. I knew it.

19:57.667 --> 19:59.583
I am...

19:59.667 --> 20:03.542
not gonna rub your sweet,
beautiful face in this.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.917
I'm sorry. You're right.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.208
I definitely think
TJ stole that lottery ticket,

20:14.291 --> 20:17.333
and I will do everything in
my power to help you find him.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.750
I love you.

20:18.834 --> 20:20.417
Oh.

20:20.500 --> 20:21.458
Oh, Matt.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.375
We don't actually
have to find TJ.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.208
I just wanted you to believe me.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.792
I do believe you.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.625
I believe you because
you're a good person.

20:28.709 --> 20:30.542
(car horn honks)

20:30.625 --> 20:32.375
WOMAN:
Hey, um, I think that's the wrong Lyft.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.083
Are you Colleen?

20:34.166 --> 20:36.500
No. She died.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.291
But only, like,
five minutes ago,

20:38.375 --> 20:39.750
so could you waive
the cancellation fee?

20:39.834 --> 20:41.125
Thank you. Bye!

20:44.041 --> 20:45.625
(both laugh)

20:47.500 --> 20:49.875
